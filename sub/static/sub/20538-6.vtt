01:26.795 --> 01:28.255
They said poo-poo.

01:28.338 --> 01:31.466
We should sew up her butthole
so she can't ever poo again.

01:31.549 --> 01:32.635
That's what we should do.

01:32.718 --> 01:34.803
But where would the poo go?

01:34.887 --> 01:37.055
It'd fill up her lungs
until she couldn't breathe.

01:37.139 --> 01:38.515
Are you okay, Leanne?

01:38.598 --> 01:41.476
I really think that
you need to get that looked at.

01:41.559 --> 01:43.436
Or at least put something over it

01:43.520 --> 01:45.397
other than a dryer sheet and rubber band.

Wouldn't you want that chance
to explain yourself

'cause I already know, Ms. Tendler.

Now that I'm 18, I gotta start
figuring out where I'm gonna live at.

Now, I know I only got a year
to figure it out,

10:12.987 --> 10:15.198
but... I got a job and I got some friends.

till you turned 18.

11:22.265 --> 11:25.352
No, no, no, no.
[stutters] That's a mistake.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.895
You can't let me go.
I'm a danger to society, sir.

11:27.979 --> 11:29.731
Be that as it may, we can't keep you.

11:29.814 --> 11:31.816

Let... let's go.

11:32.734 --> 11:34.694

11:34.777 --> 11:37.196
She'll be over to get you
after she drops the kids at soccer.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.698
Thanks, Tom.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.951
Ah, don't despair, little buddy.

11:42.034 --> 11:45.288
This is why God invented booze
and the drunk tank, hmm?

11:46.206 --> 11:48.416
You need to slip from your troubles,

11:48.916 --> 11:51.336

and you spend the night in here.

11:51.419 --> 11:52.587

where she'd...

bounce her leg
while she was tryin' to fall asleep.

13:26.473 --> 13:27.974
The whole fucking bed would creak.

13:28.057 --> 13:30.142
It drove me crazy.
I would wanna punch her.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.019
[Janae sniffles]

13:36.608 --> 13:38.485
Now I can't fall asleep...

13:40.403 --> 13:41.863
'cause I lie here...

13:43.781 --> 13:45.408

13:50.329 --> 13:51.623

13:53.500 --> 13:55.668
I never got to sleep next to her.

13:58.337 --> 13:59.714
That's the thing.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.675
I'm not sad. I'm angry.

14:04.677 --> 14:05.762
I hate everyone.

14:08.515 --> 14:13.060
Anyone... laughing or smiling or...

14:14.020 --> 14:18.315

and they should all just fucking die.

14:21.318 --> 14:23.821
And eventually,
I'm just gonna burn up from rage

14:23.905 --> 14:25.197
and then I'll just be dust.

14:25.281 --> 14:28.326
And I don't know how to make it stop.

14:31.413 --> 14:32.622

You are coming with me.

14:41.297 --> 14:42.507

14:42.590 --> 14:44.592
So?
We'll drop it off at your cousin's.

14:44.676 --> 14:46.343
She owes me for the acrylics, anyway.

14:47.261 --> 14:48.345

14:49.055 --> 14:52.308
Wow, <i>pero,</i> you look like...

15:01.734 --> 15:03.486
[inmate] Ahh! Gotcha! [chuckles]

15:14.539 --> 15:17.750
So, suddenly everybody think
they on Orchard Beach or some shit?

15:18.585 --> 15:21.504
I was thinking more Miami,
but thank you for ruining the fantasy.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.214
Right before Drake was gonna
come over, too.

15:23.297 --> 15:26.383
Oh, shit, you think Pitbull
might be coming, too?

15:26.468 --> 15:27.719
[Dayanara] Nah, girl.

15:27.802 --> 15:29.261
Maybe Fat Joe, if you're lucky.

15:29.846 --> 15:31.722
It's like Pitbull super-sized.

15:32.223 --> 15:34.058
What the hell are you doing out here?

15:35.101 --> 15:36.894
I was jealous. Wanted a tan. [grunts]

15:37.394 --> 15:38.771
Mmm-hmm.

15:38.855 --> 15:42.233
Don't you be trying to bring
any of that crap from inside out here.

15:42.316 --> 15:43.610
Out here, we're trying to relax and shit.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.654
Like you're really relaxing
in the middle of all this

15:46.738 --> 15:48.322
after what went down?

15:48.405 --> 15:50.825
It's more like I'm just tryin'
not to make shit worse.

15:51.493 --> 15:52.910
Yeah, I hear that.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.164
You seriously trying to sit out now?

15:57.248 --> 15:58.458
Yeah.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.043
I think so.

16:01.127 --> 16:04.005
You know, I'm trying to get back home
to my baby girl one day,

16:04.088 --> 16:05.214
and this might be the only way

16:05.297 --> 16:07.424
to avoid all the fucked up shit
that keeps finding me.

16:07.509 --> 16:10.678
It's like...
It's like I'm a fucked-up-shit magnet.

16:12.013 --> 16:14.891
It ain't you. Prison's the magnet.

16:15.391 --> 16:16.809
You think so?

16:16.893 --> 16:17.977
I hope so.

16:18.895 --> 16:21.147
I gotta believe
things'll be better on the outside.

16:22.732 --> 16:24.025
To laying low.

16:26.736 --> 16:28.320
To Drake's fine ass.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.658
-I'll drink to that. [chuckles]
-Mmm.

She's showing.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.748
-You're texting with Cal?
-What else am I gonna do?

16:39.331 --> 16:42.544
It's not like I'm busy
with any important riot duties.

16:42.627 --> 16:46.673
Oh, my God. Sitting this out
must be so hard for you.

16:47.674 --> 16:51.093

if you're not in charge of something soon?

16:51.177 --> 16:53.262
Whatever you say, my great leader.

16:54.764 --> 16:58.810
I am only here to serve you,
my great leader.

17:00.311 --> 17:01.729
Well, that's kinda hot.

[both chuckle]

17:05.273 --> 17:06.317
What can I tell you?

17:06.400 --> 17:10.404
Yeah, you can keep crying about Hugo...
or you can make another decision.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.575
It's hard to lose a pet, eh.

17:14.366 --> 17:16.868
Especially when he gets blown up
by your ex-husband

17:16.953 --> 17:18.954
during a botched attempt
to murder your neighbor.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.123
I mean, it's a tale as old as time.

17:21.207 --> 17:24.001
Someone, who was definitely
not my meditation instructor

17:24.085 --> 17:25.294
at rehab number seven in Sedona,

17:25.377 --> 17:28.631
once told me
that depression is holding on...

17:29.632 --> 17:32.719
and sadness is, uh... letting go.

17:33.469 --> 17:36.598
I think it's time
for you to let go of Hugo.

17:38.390 --> 17:42.186
You're right.
You're absolutely right.

17:43.563 --> 17:44.856
I have to let go.

17:48.693 --> 17:49.694

17:49.777 --> 17:51.445
-Thank you.
-All right.

sexy dreams?

18:38.284 --> 18:40.286
[stammers] Do these dreams, uh...

18:41.203 --> 18:43.580
involve penises?

18:43.665 --> 18:48.252
Because that is going to drastically
reduce my interest in the subject matter.

18:48.335 --> 18:50.046
No penises.

18:50.129 --> 18:53.215
-Well, not exactly.

23:16.103 --> 23:20.441
The governor is fully prepared
to do everything he can to meet them,

23:20.524 --> 23:22.734
but we delivered supplies
as an act of good faith,

23:22.818 --> 23:26.072
and now we'll need the same
from you and the inmates in return.

23:27.573 --> 23:31.202
Yeah, see, I don't see
how some snacks equals our hostages.

23:31.285 --> 23:35.497
Miss Jefferson, please don't make
the mistake of thinking we're the enemy.

23:35.581 --> 23:37.916
Everyone wants this to end peacefully.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.251
But we need your help.

23:39.751 --> 23:43.797
<i>If you surrender the hostages,</i>
<i>we will do our best to meet your demands.</i>

23:43.880 --> 23:46.258
[scoffs] Do you think I'm not smart?

23:46.342 --> 23:49.803
You think I don't hear those trick words,
"Do our best," Miss, uh--

23:49.886 --> 23:52.681
-Reddy.
<i>-Well, my best friend is gone, Miss Reddy.</i>

23:52.764 --> 23:54.808
So, "Do our best" ain't
good enough no more.

23:56.435 --> 23:57.644
"Do our best."

23:58.562 --> 24:00.272
What my defense lawyer told me.

24:00.356 --> 24:03.650
Man, you'd think they'd come up
with some better shit by now.

24:04.485 --> 24:05.987
So, where does this leave us?

24:08.614 --> 24:10.199
Right where it dropped us off.

24:11.283 --> 24:12.409
[sighs]

24:20.542 --> 24:21.752
Tasha?

24:30.386 --> 24:31.595
Hello.

24:34.723 --> 24:36.183
You look just like--

24:36.267 --> 24:37.934
It's nice to meet you, Miss Jefferson.

24:38.019 --> 24:40.021
Mia, please.

24:40.646 --> 24:43.399
-[sighs] You wanna sit?
-Oh.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.277
[Mia] Yeah. Thanks.

24:48.070 --> 24:49.446
Thank you for meeting me.

24:53.575 --> 24:55.119
Why didn't you want me?

24:56.870 --> 24:57.913
Tasha--

24:57.996 --> 24:59.831
It's Taystee now.

25:03.252 --> 25:04.461
I was 15.

25:05.754 --> 25:07.673
I didn't have nothing.

25:07.756 --> 25:10.467
No place to live. No parents.

25:11.635 --> 25:14.972
Just a boyfriend and a tiny room
in his nasty aunt's apartment, then...

25:16.473 --> 25:17.641
Then I got pregnant.

25:18.934 --> 25:21.353
She told us she'd kick us both out
if we kept it...

25:22.313 --> 25:23.439
You.

25:24.523 --> 25:25.732
Shit.

25:27.734 --> 25:30.862
I sound like one of them bad TV movies
on the white lady channel.

25:32.114 --> 25:33.865
-Lifetime.
-What?

25:35.326 --> 25:37.578
Channel where all those
white ladies be cryin'.

25:37.661 --> 25:38.870
It's Lifetime.

25:39.788 --> 25:43.084
Ain't that also where them crazy parents
be dressing up their kids like the...

25:43.167 --> 25:44.876
the dolls you put on top
of the toilet paper?

25:44.960 --> 25:47.296
Yeah. [chuckles]
<i>Toddlers and Tiaras.</i>

25:47.379 --> 25:48.547
-Yeah. [chuckles]
-That's my favorite!

25:48.630 --> 25:50.466
[both laughing]

25:52.676 --> 25:55.054
I spent so many hours thinkin' about
what you'd look like...

25:56.972 --> 25:58.557
who you grew to be and...

25:59.766 --> 26:01.102
what makes you laugh.

26:03.187 --> 26:05.063
And you, here...

26:06.815 --> 26:08.317
are better than I ever dreamed.

26:11.195 --> 26:13.989
Thank you for giving me a chance.

26:16.283 --> 26:18.285
Thank you for finding me.

26:19.245 --> 26:20.746
[Timaya] Mommy!

26:21.705 --> 26:23.415
Baby, what are you doin' here?

26:23.499 --> 26:25.584
Hey, baby.
We headed to the church.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.836
Hopin' to get baby girl
some new shoes at the sale.

26:27.919 --> 26:30.131
-[Mia] Oh...
-[Owen] Who's your friend?

26:30.756 --> 26:32.758
This is Taystee.

26:32.841 --> 26:34.343
Um, you remember Robin?

26:34.426 --> 26:37.179
She used to live over on Troy?
This is her girl.

26:37.263 --> 26:39.223
Oh. Right.
Hey, Taystee.

26:39.306 --> 26:41.308
Daddy, let's go!

26:41.392 --> 26:43.477
All right, baby.
I'll see you at home.

26:43.560 --> 26:45.479
[Timaya] Bye, Mommy!
Bye, other lady!

26:48.982 --> 26:50.359
They don't know about me.

26:52.068 --> 26:55.531
They will. I promise.

26:55.614 --> 26:56.948
It's just, I wasn't...

26:57.949 --> 27:00.161
You know, nobody teaches you
how to be doin' these things.

27:00.244 --> 27:03.247
And I wanted to meet you first.
And reconnect.

27:06.417 --> 27:09.044
I'll do right, okay?

27:11.547 --> 27:13.048
I want you to be family.

27:20.972 --> 27:22.183
[indistinct chatter and laughter]

27:22.266 --> 27:24.726
Chubby dude,
you can cross-examine the witness.

27:30.607 --> 27:34.236
Ladies and gentlemen, a tap dance.

27:35.696 --> 27:37.155
Miss Rice.

27:37.239 --> 27:39.908
Earlier, you stated that your favorite
television show is <i>Saved by the Bell.</i>

27:39.991 --> 27:42.203
-Is this correct?
-Objectification!

27:42.286 --> 27:43.287
[grunts]

27:43.370 --> 27:45.331
Nope. Sit down.
Answer the man's question.

27:47.040 --> 27:49.084
That's correct.
<i>Saved by the Bell.</i>

27:49.167 --> 27:52.003
Mmm-hmm. And, uh, what would you say
is your favorite episode?

27:52.671 --> 27:57.175
Uh, that's easy. Um, the one where
Jessie gets addicted to caffeine pills.

27:57.259 --> 27:58.594
'Cause it's real relatable. [chuckles]

27:58.677 --> 28:00.221
[chuckling] Yes, it's a classic.

28:00.304 --> 28:03.557
Yes. See, Jessie could not handle

28:03.640 --> 28:06.518
the pressure of midterms
and her singing group...

28:06.852 --> 28:07.894
could she?

28:07.978 --> 28:10.939
Except, I didn't like how they were,
like, you know,

28:11.022 --> 28:13.234
"Drugs are bad.
Blah blah blah."

28:13.317 --> 28:16.653
Because I just don't think that that's
a good message to be sending to kids.

28:17.279 --> 28:18.614
[Big Boo] Hmm.

28:18.697 --> 28:21.617
And what do you think of,
say, "Boss Lady"?

28:23.619 --> 28:24.661
You know,

28:24.745 --> 28:26.872
the one where the whole gang
is working at the Malibu Sands.

28:26.955 --> 28:29.916
Stacey has to be the boss
and nothing goes wrong.

28:31.042 --> 28:34.255
-Oh, yeah, that one.
-[chuckling]

28:34.338 --> 28:37.633
It's funny.
So uncomplicated.

28:37.716 --> 28:38.842
[Big Boo] Hmm.

28:40.511 --> 28:42.346
Miss Rice.

28:42.429 --> 28:45.224
Would you say that if something
is your favorite,

28:45.307 --> 28:46.808
you will have seen every episode?

28:47.643 --> 28:49.853
-Of course.
-[chuckles]

28:49.936 --> 28:51.397
I'm glad we agree on that.

28:51.480 --> 28:54.441
Because I don't know about the rest
of the ladies and gentlemen in the court,

28:54.525 --> 28:56.610
but if I say something is my favorite,

28:56.693 --> 28:59.863
you better be damn sure that I have seen
every episode multiple times.

28:59.946 --> 29:03.575
And I know that show
like the back of my hand. Mmm?

29:03.659 --> 29:05.744
Therefore, you will forgive my confusion

29:05.827 --> 29:09.373
as to why you have not seen
episode ten, season three,

29:09.456 --> 29:11.333
where, despite the delightful ending,

29:11.417 --> 29:14.670
which involves the entire gang
coming together to help Stacey,

29:14.753 --> 29:17.381
everything goes wrong!

29:17.464 --> 29:18.882
[inmates chatter]

29:19.841 --> 29:21.718
Who is Stacey?

29:21.802 --> 29:24.680
I submit... the witness is a liar.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.014
She is not credible.

29:26.097 --> 29:27.849
And I have no further questions!

29:27.933 --> 29:29.643
-[inmates cheering]
-Wait a minute!

29:29.726 --> 29:31.812
-Wait a minute!
-[applause]

29:31.895 --> 29:33.647
That ain't got nothing to do
with anything!

29:33.730 --> 29:36.149
We still saw her give Donuts the gun.

29:36.232 --> 29:38.735
Yes! She is guilty!

29:38.819 --> 29:41.280
Even if Lisa Turtle is my favorite!

29:41.363 --> 29:43.156
-That's crazy. Come on.
-She is a liar.

29:43.239 --> 29:44.908
No one likes Lisa Turtle best.

29:44.991 --> 29:47.202
-Poo! Poo! Poo!
-[overlapping chatter]

29:47.286 --> 29:50.205
-Order in the court! Order in the court!
-This is ridiculous!

29:50.289 --> 29:51.873
There's got to be a better way.

30:09.641 --> 30:10.726
[sighs]

30:11.352 --> 30:13.729
[Aleida] Holy fuck, am I gonna be famous.

30:13.812 --> 30:16.315
[Margarita] Okay,
this shit is fucking bananas.

30:16.398 --> 30:18.942
Aleida? Hi. April.
We spoke on the phone.

30:19.025 --> 30:21.403
Let's get you inside.
And we'll get you into makeup.

30:21.487 --> 30:23.196
You hear that shit?
"Get you into makeup."

30:24.448 --> 30:26.241
Hey, Ape, let me ask you a question.

30:26.325 --> 30:27.868
I get paid for this shit, right?

30:27.951 --> 30:30.621
You think you could give me
that grand in cash, up-front?

30:30.704 --> 30:33.123
[chuckles] What? Did someone tell you
you were gonna get paid?

30:33.206 --> 30:34.750
We can't pay our guests.
It's against--

30:34.833 --> 30:37.794
-I'm just fucking with you, Ape. [laughs]
-Okay.

30:37.878 --> 30:40.046
We're really going to need to get those
"fucks" out of your system

30:40.130 --> 30:42.048
before we go live.

30:43.008 --> 30:45.802
You would not believe
the cost of an electrical rewire.

30:45.886 --> 30:47.763
Totally astronomical.

30:47.846 --> 30:51.182
So, it's like, uh, do we try to do
the work ourselves?

30:51.266 --> 30:53.769
-You know, I bought a book.
-You're not an electrician.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.228
Okay, I could try.

30:55.311 --> 30:57.856
And what happens
when the whole house goes up in flames,

30:57.939 --> 30:59.441
we're left with nothing, or, God forbid,

30:59.525 --> 31:01.902
you get a shock and cook yourself
from the inside out--

31:01.985 --> 31:04.488
Stop. Stop.
You're gonna stress out the muffin.

31:04.571 --> 31:07.616
-[blows and whispers] You're right.
-Babe...

31:11.370 --> 31:13.413
-[Bell exhales]
-So, what you been up to, man?

31:14.498 --> 31:16.458
Wanting to die, mostly.

31:17.959 --> 31:20.379
Oh, careful there.

31:21.337 --> 31:24.550
Your mom can't hear you usin' the D word,
understand?

31:25.258 --> 31:27.928
Don't want you bouncin'
around a rubber room.

31:28.595 --> 31:30.722
[stutters] Yeah,
that's a rough break you got, man.

31:30.806 --> 31:32.516
But, you know, uh...

31:33.892 --> 31:35.143
it's gonna be fine.

31:36.437 --> 31:38.939
Why does everyone keep saying that to me?

31:39.022 --> 31:41.525
[stammering] That things are
gonna be fine?

31:42.233 --> 31:44.360
How does that work, exactly?

31:45.278 --> 31:46.822
Is there a, uh...

31:46.905 --> 31:52.911
a magic wand or some type of special God
who loves homicidal white guys?

31:54.913 --> 31:56.122
It's not gonna be fine.

31:57.207 --> 32:02.045
The whole point of life is waiting to see
what comes next, but...

32:03.296 --> 32:05.716
I already know exactly
how mine's gonna go.

32:07.467 --> 32:08.635
So what's the point?

32:10.095 --> 32:11.179
I should die.

32:17.478 --> 32:20.105
-Run?
-Mmm-hmm. Run.

32:20.188 --> 32:24.317
As fast as you can, until you feel like
your lungs is about to collapse.

32:24.401 --> 32:28.738
Until you can't think about nothing
but how tired your legs are.

32:29.405 --> 32:30.991
I think I'm still drunk.

32:31.074 --> 32:33.160
[clicks tongue] You won't be after this.

32:33.994 --> 32:36.037
-Come on.
-[groans]

32:36.121 --> 32:38.624
Hey! We gonna need your snacks.

32:38.707 --> 32:40.751
-[scoffs]
-Oh, you see how you just say, "yours"?

32:40.834 --> 32:42.377
As in, belonging to us?

32:42.461 --> 32:44.337
It's important.

32:44.420 --> 32:45.756
You're, like, what, the snack police?

32:45.839 --> 32:47.716
Yo, they were a bribe.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.301
Mr. Fancy-Pants Governor thought
he would trick us into surrendering

32:50.385 --> 32:52.513
-with snacks and tampons.
-Mmm-hmm.

32:52.596 --> 32:54.305
They trying to plug all our holes.

32:54.389 --> 32:56.600
So you're throwing them away?
[stammers] That's a great plan.

32:56.683 --> 32:58.268
We gotta show 'em we serious.

32:58.351 --> 33:00.270
-That's badass.
-No, it's stupid.

33:00.353 --> 33:02.564
Yeah. Don't... don't we want this to end?

33:02.648 --> 33:05.233
-We want justice.
-Well, you want justice.

33:05.316 --> 33:07.569
We want to go home to our families
at some point.

33:07.653 --> 33:10.614
Well, some of us ain't got a home outside.

33:10.697 --> 33:12.616
This is my home,
and I'm gonna fight for it.

33:13.324 --> 33:16.036
Do you think that they would be
doing this to us if we were men?

33:16.119 --> 33:17.663
This is so insulting.

33:17.746 --> 33:19.498
-Exactly.
-Here we go.

33:19.581 --> 33:21.041
-[Piper] What?
-There she goes.

33:21.124 --> 33:24.460
I'm done sitting out there and sunbathing.
I mean, we've all done the hard part.

33:24.545 --> 33:27.798
That's what I'm saying.
All we gotta do is wait 'em out.

33:27.881 --> 33:29.090
We owe this to ourselves.

33:29.174 --> 33:30.801
That's right. [chuckles]

33:32.553 --> 33:33.970
[Piper grunts]

33:37.015 --> 33:38.099
How can I help?

33:38.183 --> 33:39.809
You can collect.

33:40.143 --> 33:41.352
But people ain't gonna like you.

33:42.062 --> 33:43.229
Story of my life.

33:44.272 --> 33:46.692
-[Taystee] Gimme these goddamn--
-Yo! I just opened that shit, man!

33:46.775 --> 33:50.070
We need all y'all motherfucking Cheetos.
Give 'em up.

33:52.363 --> 33:53.615
[blows]

34:31.570 --> 34:32.821
[sighs]

34:34.989 --> 34:36.366
[groans]

34:49.920 --> 34:51.505
[chuckles]

34:58.639 --> 35:00.682
-[man] Sixty seconds.
-Almost finished?

35:00.766 --> 35:04.102
[Aleida] Well, if what's-her-face stopped
using words like, "subtle" and "dewy,"

35:04.185 --> 35:05.937
we could've finished yesterday.

35:07.022 --> 35:09.107
-[sighs]
-You look gorgeous.

35:09.190 --> 35:10.400
Thank you.

35:10.483 --> 35:13.319
All right. Good luck!
Make your answers real long.

35:13.403 --> 35:14.613
You'll sound smarter that way.

35:14.696 --> 35:17.115
And turn your right side to the camera.
That's your pretty side.

35:17.198 --> 35:19.284
And use the news guy's name a lot.

35:19.367 --> 35:22.162
Ooh, ooh! And always answer a question
with another question.

35:22.245 --> 35:23.538
-Ooh.
-[man] Fifteen seconds.

35:23.622 --> 35:25.957
[sighs] Look, do me a favor
and don't get me fired, okay?

35:26.041 --> 35:27.668
Fired? I'm gonna get your ass
a promotion.

35:27.751 --> 35:30.962
[sighs] Aleida, this is Susan.
She'll be interviewing you today.

35:31.046 --> 35:34.424
-[man] Air in five, four, three, two...
-Hello.

35:34.507 --> 35:35.634
[exhales]

35:35.717 --> 35:38.553
Welcome back to <i>New York Metro,</i>
where we're continuing to track

35:38.637 --> 35:41.682
the developing situation
at Litchfield Federal Prison.

35:41.765 --> 35:46.102
Joining us today is Aleida Diaz,
a former inmate at Litchfield.

35:46.186 --> 35:49.731
Miss Diaz, I understand you were
very recently released.

35:50.732 --> 35:52.275
Was I recently released?

35:55.153 --> 35:56.655
[Susan] I'm not sure what you mean.

35:56.738 --> 35:58.156
Exactly, Susie-Q. [chuckles]

35:59.157 --> 36:00.283
It's Susan.

36:00.366 --> 36:05.330
Have you had any contact with anyone
at Litchfield since this situation arose?

36:05.413 --> 36:07.457
Do you...
do you still have friends inside?

36:08.834 --> 36:11.127
Yeah. I... And I talked to them.

36:11.211 --> 36:12.337
Are they okay?

36:13.546 --> 36:16.007
Well, it's hard to get answers
from those bitches, you know?

36:16.091 --> 36:18.634
-Oh. Sorry. Can I say "bitches"?
-You can. [chuckles]

36:18.719 --> 36:20.345
-Well, shit.
-Oh, you can't say that.

36:20.428 --> 36:22.889
What kind of fucking
bullshit rule is that?

36:22.973 --> 36:24.099
Okay.

36:24.933 --> 36:27.560
What do you think she's doing, right now?

36:28.812 --> 36:32.774
Probably sitting on her veranda,

36:32.857 --> 36:37.153
being served
some kind of garden fresh salad

36:37.237 --> 36:40.407
with walnuts and goat cheese.

36:40.907 --> 36:46.913
Maybe it's accompanied
by some sort of tropical iced green tea.

36:46.997 --> 36:48.331
Goat cheese.

36:49.332 --> 36:50.625
That's so Judy.

36:51.209 --> 36:53.754
She probably knows the goat it came from.

36:54.755 --> 36:56.631
You think she liked us?

36:57.590 --> 36:58.550
Maybe.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.386
Before we kidnapped her
and nailed her to a cross.

37:01.469 --> 37:02.678
Yeah.

37:03.429 --> 37:06.349
Hand over all your Cheetos and Takis.
Now.

37:06.432 --> 37:08.894
Ooh, Chapman coming in hot!

37:09.519 --> 37:10.520
We didn't get any.

37:10.603 --> 37:12.731
Let's go. Hand 'em over.

37:12.814 --> 37:16.067
We have no idea what you're talking about.

37:16.151 --> 37:18.153
-You are a liar.
-[Black Cindy] Mmm-hmm.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.613
Anyone ever tell you about
the catching bees with honey thing?

37:20.696 --> 37:23.449
-It's important to draw a hard line.
-The line was, like, 100 feet back.

37:23.533 --> 37:26.369
-Check her fingers.
-[scoffs] Perfect.

37:26.452 --> 37:30.206
'Cause you know what was on my agenda
today? Molest an old lady.

37:30.957 --> 37:32.125
Fine.

37:33.418 --> 37:34.669
I'll do it.

37:36.421 --> 37:37.798
Let me see your fingers.

37:40.216 --> 37:42.093
Let me see your...
Let me see your finger.

37:42.677 --> 37:44.137
-Let me see your fingers.
-[Anita grunts]

37:45.638 --> 37:47.682
-[Black Cindy sighs]
-See?

37:48.349 --> 37:51.937
Holy shit.
Nancy Drew done uncovered a suspect.

37:52.020 --> 37:53.980
-Let's search 'em.
-Now, hold on a second.

37:54.064 --> 37:59.069
You don't have the right
to go through our things like that. But--

38:00.445 --> 38:03.198
-[Piper] Gotcha.
-So much for respecting your elders!

38:03.281 --> 38:05.116
[Black Cindy] Yeah.

38:07.118 --> 38:08.494
Psst.

38:08.578 --> 38:09.662
Psst!

38:20.631 --> 38:22.801
-You gonna miss me?
-Nah.

38:22.884 --> 38:26.304
You just jealous
'cause I got a family and you don't.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.640
Family ain't got nothing to do with it.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.143
You think these people gonna like you?

38:33.686 --> 38:36.481
They sitting at home,
having themselves a nice little life,

38:36.564 --> 38:40.235
and then some hood rat gonna move in
and shit's gonna be like the Cosbys?

38:40.944 --> 38:42.904
[chuckles] Girl, you trippin'.

38:44.114 --> 38:45.365
Well...

38:46.908 --> 38:50.120
I hope one day you find your family,
same as me.

39:02.340 --> 39:05.218
I told y'all! [laughing]

39:05.301 --> 39:06.719
[squeals]

39:06.802 --> 39:08.096
[sighs]

39:10.431 --> 39:11.516
Don't mind them.

39:11.599 --> 39:12.976
[laughing]

39:14.560 --> 39:16.437
Yo, where should I put this?
In the back?

39:16.521 --> 39:17.856
[stutters] Taystee...

39:19.357 --> 39:20.400
I'm so sorry.

39:22.986 --> 39:24.487
You... you can't come live with us.

39:27.365 --> 39:28.449
Wait...

39:29.367 --> 39:31.202
Why?
Ms. Tendler said that you--

39:31.286 --> 39:32.703
[stutters] I'm...

39:32.787 --> 39:35.248
I don't think she understood
what I was trying to tell her.

39:35.331 --> 39:36.707
Why can't I come?

39:36.791 --> 39:38.459
It's just not a good time for us.

39:39.669 --> 39:40.879
Us.

39:42.463 --> 39:44.883
-Right.
-Uh, look.

39:44.966 --> 39:46.551
I want you to take this.

39:47.510 --> 39:49.637
It's not much, but I want to help you.

39:51.264 --> 39:54.475
Did you tell them... about me?

39:56.561 --> 39:58.479
-[cries]
-[grunts]

39:58.563 --> 40:01.357
-[crying]
-Guess this is you doin' right, huh?

40:01.441 --> 40:02.525
What's right for you!

40:04.860 --> 40:08.864
-Maybe I need to start doin' that, too.
-Please, Taystee, wait!

40:13.786 --> 40:15.330
[sobbing]

40:18.416 --> 40:20.043
All right.
Now I have a question.

40:20.126 --> 40:23.463
How many of y'all took the stands
at your all's trials? Raise your hand.

40:25.840 --> 40:29.177
Wow! Ain't that some bull?
Well, neither did I.

40:29.260 --> 40:32.097
'Cause my lawyer told me
that I was a detriment to myself.

40:32.180 --> 40:34.349
[chuckles] Now, at the time,
I didn't take offense,

40:34.432 --> 40:37.060
because I was rather high
most of the time.

40:37.143 --> 40:39.437
And you know my brain wires weren't
firing correctly,

40:39.520 --> 40:40.771
if you know what I mean.

40:41.814 --> 40:45.235
But today, I'm standing here, right,
and I'm looking around at all of y'all.

40:45.318 --> 40:47.988
And I'm thinking... we can do better.

40:48.071 --> 40:50.615
Know what? Fuck that.
We have to do better than this.

40:50.698 --> 40:53.159
But you know what?
It really needs to be fair.

40:53.243 --> 40:56.287
Without all the goobly-goop of lawyers
and judges and the system and stuff.

40:56.371 --> 40:58.081
-Hmm.
-[Pennsatucky] Right?

40:58.581 --> 40:59.915
So, listen...

41:01.001 --> 41:02.252
I helped Donuts escape.

41:02.335 --> 41:03.794
-[all sigh]
-[Big Boo] What? Oh, Jesus!

41:03.878 --> 41:05.463
Oh, please.

41:05.546 --> 41:07.215
I strongly suggest
you shut the fuck up, girl.

41:07.298 --> 41:09.842
No. It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

41:09.925 --> 41:13.013
Listen, my friend here,
she's worried that I'm gonna say too much.

41:13.096 --> 41:14.805
But all I can say is the truth.

41:15.473 --> 41:16.516
And the truth is

41:16.599 --> 41:18.434
-I helped the guard escape.
-Oh, fuck.

41:19.602 --> 41:22.813
And, yeah, we had a relationship
that was difficult to define.

41:22.897 --> 41:24.565
It was even confusing at times.

41:24.649 --> 41:26.526
But... let me ask y'all.

41:26.609 --> 41:28.028
What would y'all have done
if you would've found him?

41:28.111 --> 41:30.238
-Cut off his balls.
-Murdered him.

41:30.321 --> 41:31.906
Poo! Poo!

41:31.990 --> 41:34.242
Realistically, we would have
roughed him up a little, you know.

41:34.325 --> 41:35.618
Just poked some shit up his ass,

41:35.701 --> 41:37.953
and then we would've stuck him
in the bubble with the rest of them.

41:38.037 --> 41:40.790
What's the point?
And then what?

41:40.999 --> 41:43.334
So you'd have another hostage. Whee!

41:44.085 --> 41:46.379
And then, another strike on your record.

41:46.462 --> 41:47.588
You know what you'd be doing, actually?

41:47.672 --> 41:49.174
You'd be staring down
the barrel of forever

41:49.257 --> 41:50.800
is what you'd be doing up in here.

41:50.883 --> 41:52.510
This is bullshit!

41:52.593 --> 41:55.388
She's not thinking about us.
She was protecting her boyfriend.

41:55.471 --> 41:56.972
No, it's not true.
Come on. Hey!

41:57.057 --> 42:00.393
Listen, all I can do is stand up here
and tell you how I feel, all right?

42:00.476 --> 42:02.437
I'm a person. I'm talking to people.

42:03.354 --> 42:04.480
Okay?

42:04.564 --> 42:06.732
I'm just gonna leave you all to it.
How about that?

42:06.816 --> 42:07.817
And if y'all think that I deserve

42:07.900 --> 42:10.153
to be thrown up in the poo-poo
or whatever, then fine.

42:10.236 --> 42:12.322
That makes you no better than them.

42:12.405 --> 42:14.407
You know, that's really sad,
because they suck.

42:15.366 --> 42:18.786
We had the chance to rule hard up in here.
Y'all don't wanna rule?

42:22.874 --> 42:24.208
All right.

42:51.111 --> 42:53.113
Hey. Uh...

42:53.196 --> 42:55.240
-I thought I'd tell you something.
-Uh-huh.

42:55.823 --> 42:57.117
[sighs]

42:57.200 --> 42:58.993
Ah! Let me guess.

43:00.203 --> 43:05.040
Uh, you regret that your clit was
vibrating on my tongue 45 minutes ago,

43:05.125 --> 43:06.792
we can never do this again.

43:06.876 --> 43:08.544
Uh, you made a vow,

43:08.628 --> 43:10.963
you need to commit to Vinnie,
something like that?

43:11.046 --> 43:12.798
-Right? I mean, I get it.
-[sighs]

43:13.924 --> 43:15.260
I memorized it.

43:16.636 --> 43:18.221
You can save it. [chuckles]

43:18.304 --> 43:19.639
No.

43:21.641 --> 43:22.975
I'm pregnant.

43:23.058 --> 43:24.269
[smacks lips]

43:25.228 --> 43:29.274
-That is a twist I was not expecting.
-[laughs]

43:30.483 --> 43:32.568
I realized when... when we was...

43:32.652 --> 43:34.779
I was looking down at you,
and then I saw,

43:34.862 --> 43:37.282
"Oh! Oh, my nipples are, like,

43:37.365 --> 43:40.368
two, three shades darker
than they normally are."

43:41.202 --> 43:43.538
And, that's, like,
a thing for the Morello women

43:43.621 --> 43:45.248
when we've got the bun in the oven.

43:46.374 --> 43:47.583
[Lorna chuckles]

43:49.835 --> 43:51.171
That's great. Uh...

43:52.087 --> 43:55.800
-Did you take a pregnancy test?
-Nope. No.

43:55.883 --> 43:58.678
No, I don't need a test.
I... I know.

43:59.762 --> 44:01.972
And that is why I've been so horny.

44:02.056 --> 44:03.308
Ah!

44:05.851 --> 44:07.687
[laughs] Oh, fuck!

44:07.770 --> 44:10.773
Why are you laughing? No.
No, no, no. I'm... I'm...

44:10.856 --> 44:13.443
This is not funny.
I'm serious.

44:13.526 --> 44:16.321
Oh, yes. I know you're serious.
I know, baby.

44:16.404 --> 44:19.990
And that is the problem.
Because you are also bat-shit crazy.

44:21.742 --> 44:23.077
[laughing]

44:30.876 --> 44:33.504
I didn't mean to lead you on, honey.

44:33.588 --> 44:35.047
It's the hormones.

44:35.130 --> 44:37.758
The hormones, they made me do it with you.

44:41.762 --> 44:44.515
I love you so much, Lorna.

44:46.141 --> 44:47.393
But, you know...

44:49.019 --> 44:52.690
you can't just, like, uh,
keep doing whatever the fuck you want

44:52.773 --> 44:54.609
and then thinking it's gonna be okay.

44:56.151 --> 44:58.529
[stutters] And the days of this, uh...

44:58.613 --> 45:01.866
crazy being quirky and cute...

45:01.949 --> 45:04.535
it's past. It's sad, you know?

45:04.619 --> 45:06.829
I mean, you need help,
and I can't help you,

45:06.912 --> 45:08.248
'cause I need to help myself.

45:08.331 --> 45:11.584
Or maybe, uh, what if you go see
the prison therapist, right?

45:11.667 --> 45:13.127
See what she has to say about it.

45:13.210 --> 45:15.087
I'm pretty sure she's gonna tell me...

45:15.170 --> 45:18.007
[stammering] She's gonna call me a dumbass

45:18.090 --> 45:20.134
sucker crazy person
for letting myself do this again.

45:20.217 --> 45:21.844
And then tell me

45:21.927 --> 45:26.516
to never, ever, ever
do this again, right?

45:26.599 --> 45:29.852
And this time, I'm gonna listen to her...

45:29.935 --> 45:32.229
'cause she's the expert, right?

45:32.313 --> 45:33.314
[scoffs]

45:38.235 --> 45:40.405
It's too late. [sniffles]

45:40.488 --> 45:42.239
I drank, like, eight bottles, okay.

45:42.323 --> 45:45.493
I'm sorry for being such a fuckup.

45:45.576 --> 45:47.745
[sniffles] I love you guys so much.

45:50.164 --> 45:51.791
Dye is nontoxic.

45:52.542 --> 45:53.584
What?

45:53.668 --> 45:56.504
I mean, you'll probably have bad squirts
for a couple days.

45:56.587 --> 45:59.924
And I have some of those wet nappies
in the bathroom, if you need them.

46:00.007 --> 46:01.509
[sighs] Oh, man.

46:02.510 --> 46:04.094
I can't even kill myself right.

46:04.178 --> 46:07.390
Honey, your dad and me...

46:07.473 --> 46:09.642
we think you need some real help.

46:10.560 --> 46:12.645
You think so? [sighs]

46:12.728 --> 46:15.648
Yeah! I do.
Of course I fucking do!

46:15.731 --> 46:18.693
All right, I got myself arrested.

46:18.776 --> 46:21.571
I have been begging to die.

46:22.237 --> 46:24.114
And all you guys want to say is,

46:24.198 --> 46:26.951
"Things will be fine,"
and, "Life's complicated."

46:27.034 --> 46:28.202
Finally!

46:28.661 --> 46:31.163
Make sure they lock me up somewhere
for a very long time.

46:31.246 --> 46:32.498
Please!

46:47.012 --> 46:48.348
This is the spot?

46:48.431 --> 46:50.140
What the hell is going on here?

46:50.224 --> 46:51.434
Beats us.

46:56.188 --> 46:59.692
Well, don't dawdle out there.
Come in, come in.

47:18.586 --> 47:20.755
You did this all yourself?

47:20.838 --> 47:22.006
Sure did.

47:22.632 --> 47:25.175
Wow. So you're like
one of those mole people

47:25.259 --> 47:28.179
that they do special news reports
and horror movies about?

47:28.846 --> 47:30.723
Yeah, we prefer "survivalist."

47:30.806 --> 47:32.141
Don't insult the woman.

47:33.058 --> 47:35.310
This is, uh, really great, Frieda.

47:35.895 --> 47:37.355
Thanks for showing us.

47:37.438 --> 47:39.940
But I probably should be getting
back upstairs and, uh...

47:40.024 --> 47:41.984
No. We're gonna stay here.

47:42.067 --> 47:43.235
All of us.

47:43.819 --> 47:45.988
I guess this is how it ends.

47:46.071 --> 47:49.825
Well, this is your chance to retire
from all that nonsense out there.

47:49.909 --> 47:52.912
Ain't you tired
of dealing with numbskulls?

47:52.995 --> 47:55.205
Fighting for food?

47:55.289 --> 48:00.252
Trying to find a minute of quiet
without someone squawking in your ear?

48:01.170 --> 48:03.756
Don't you feel taken for granted?

48:06.300 --> 48:09.261
I got enough supplies down here
for all of us.

48:10.345 --> 48:13.307
It's, maybe, a little cramped?

48:14.100 --> 48:15.101
Huh.

48:15.768 --> 48:17.269
"Thank you, Frieda."

48:17.352 --> 48:20.773
"Gee, this is awful nice of you, Frieda."

48:29.574 --> 48:31.951
Come on.
You don't need to be scared.

48:32.034 --> 48:33.578
I bet that's what they tell the cows

48:33.661 --> 48:35.663
right before they send them
down the chute.

48:52.555 --> 48:53.806
This could work.

48:58.060 --> 49:00.813
This is amazing, Frieda!

49:02.106 --> 49:03.691
I got dibs on shuffleboard.

49:03.774 --> 49:05.610
Does this thing have <i>Frogger?</i>

49:07.653 --> 49:08.988
[chuckles]

49:10.322 --> 49:12.324
Watch out for the cords there.

49:18.372 --> 49:19.624
[indistinct chatter]

49:20.541 --> 49:21.959
What the hell were you thinking?

49:22.042 --> 49:23.669
Aren't you tired
of asking me that question?

49:23.753 --> 49:25.838
'Cause I sure as shit am
tired of answering it.

49:25.921 --> 49:27.548
Yeah. Well, they're gonna crucify you.

49:27.632 --> 49:30.926
-So? It'll only take a few hours.
-What?

49:32.011 --> 49:35.515
What? This... this is all
gonna be over soon.

49:35.598 --> 49:37.224
Okay, let 'em throw me in the Poo.

49:37.307 --> 49:39.309
It's all gonna go back
to the way it was, anyhow.

49:39.393 --> 49:40.603
None of this is for long.

49:42.813 --> 49:44.607
You know, you really freak me out
when you're smart.

49:44.690 --> 49:46.316
Yeah, well, you and me, both, okay?

49:46.400 --> 49:50.154
[chuckles] I just thank Jesus
that my brain wires are connecting today.

49:54.033 --> 49:55.743
-[clears throat]
-Oh.

49:55.826 --> 49:56.911
We have our verdict.

50:04.669 --> 50:06.629
We discussed your case...

50:06.712 --> 50:09.757
came up with something
that's almost unanimous.

50:09.840 --> 50:11.133
[Leanne scoffs]

50:11.216 --> 50:13.678
So, Tiffany Doggett...

50:14.637 --> 50:17.347
for crimes against our community,
we assign you...

50:18.265 --> 50:19.934
-community service.
-Yes.

50:20.434 --> 50:23.896
Next step is we'll sit down,
talk about your skills,

50:23.979 --> 50:26.816
and figure out how you can best
contribute to your community.

50:28.233 --> 50:30.986
We'll just be people, talking.

50:31.862 --> 50:33.405
-Like you said.
-Bullshit.

50:33.488 --> 50:37.785
We don't all agree, but so long as
we're all in here doing this thing,

50:37.868 --> 50:42.497
we think that our justice system
should focus on rehabilitation. Yeah?

50:42.582 --> 50:45.042
One crime should not define a person.

50:45.125 --> 50:47.086
Thank you. Yeah.
I'm gonna make you guys so proud.

50:47.169 --> 50:48.212
-You'll see.
-[chuckles]

50:49.546 --> 50:51.465
Poo! Poo! Poo!

50:51.548 --> 50:53.217
Does she have a reset button?

50:57.763 --> 50:59.724
It's like watching
the most predictable movie.

51:00.808 --> 51:02.893
At least I'm doing something.

51:02.977 --> 51:05.646
Plus, I'm probably gonna get
pretty toned in the process.

51:06.814 --> 51:09.817
Goodbye, honey! Have a good day at work!
You're a ridiculous human!

51:09.900 --> 51:12.653
Man, these bitches are
fucking us over so hard.

51:12.737 --> 51:15.990
I know, right? What am I gonna do
when I have a snack attack or my period?

51:16.073 --> 51:19.910
I can respect the moral code,
but being that blindly committed...

51:21.036 --> 51:22.537
that's when shit gets dangerous.

51:24.248 --> 51:25.958
[man over PA] <i>Okay, 10 minutes.</i>

51:26.041 --> 51:27.501
[Kristen] India was my favorite section

51:27.584 --> 51:29.712
because it kind of reminded me
of being in here, you know,

51:29.795 --> 51:31.380
being forced
to deprive yourself and stuff.

51:31.463 --> 51:34.049
Yeah. No, it was like Weight Watchers,

51:34.133 --> 51:36.343
but with, like, more cows
and less point counting.

51:36.426 --> 51:39.138
Prison's like free Weight Watchers.
I've lost, like, at least five pounds.

51:39.221 --> 51:41.807
[Ashley] Like I haven't noticed.
Those khakis are falling off of you.

51:41.891 --> 51:42.892
[Kristen] Thank you.

51:42.975 --> 51:45.811
-[Ashley] But now I'm hungry.
-[chuckles] Oh, my God, I'm starving.

51:45.895 --> 51:48.313
-Commissary ice cream?
-Fuck to the yes.

51:48.397 --> 51:50.399
[man over PA]
<i>Be all notified of gate time.</i>

51:51.734 --> 51:55.696
[Poussey] "Amanda, I will not stop
until my ass is so small

51:55.780 --> 51:57.322
it disappears entirely.

51:57.406 --> 52:00.785
[gasps] You heard about this new diet
where you eat cookies and ice cream,

52:00.868 --> 52:02.327
and you still lose weight?

52:02.411 --> 52:04.163
Ooh! It's called bulimia."

52:04.246 --> 52:05.748
-[chuckles]
-"And, oh!

52:05.831 --> 52:08.167
I love it so much.
It's a miracle."

52:09.877 --> 52:13.297
"Oh, Mackenzie, I have always been
jealous of your willpower.

52:13.380 --> 52:15.090
I'm like a house ever since Mark

52:15.174 --> 52:18.427
invested in that new modern
American bistro up the street.

52:18.510 --> 52:21.221
You would die for their artisanal sodas.

52:21.305 --> 52:25.309
Peach, lavender, rose petal.
Yes, please!"

52:26.352 --> 52:27.603
'Sup, Amanda?

52:28.103 --> 52:29.021
Mackenzie.

52:29.521 --> 52:32.316
-When'd you get in?
-[sighs] Yesterday.

52:32.399 --> 52:35.986
Well, you've got good taste in books,
so you're all right with me.

52:38.197 --> 52:40.407
-Taystee.
-Poussey.

52:40.490 --> 52:44.328
[chuckles] Your mama did not
name you Pussy.

52:44.411 --> 52:46.246
Yo. For real?

52:46.330 --> 52:49.709
I mean, you all new and talking shit
with a name like Taystee?

52:49.792 --> 52:52.837
That's fair. My bad. [chuckles]

52:53.587 --> 52:55.881
Look, you let me know
if you need anything in here, okay?

52:55.965 --> 52:59.259
Okay. I will. Thanks.

52:59.343 --> 53:02.179
And, um, you can take Alice for now.

53:02.262 --> 53:04.056
'Cause she's good at
keepin' folks company.

53:04.556 --> 53:05.599
She's my favorite.

53:05.682 --> 53:07.226
So I'm gonna
need that shit back eventually.

53:08.393 --> 53:09.603
Deal.

53:11.188 --> 53:12.397
Yeah.

53:14.358 --> 53:16.276
-[both snap fingers]
-Welcome to prison. [chuckles]

53:16.360 --> 53:17.569
[sighs]

53:19.029 --> 53:20.447
[officer] Right, hold on.
They're coming back.

53:20.530 --> 53:22.449
-[Taystee] Get this on tape, huh!
-Y'all wanna bribe?

53:22.532 --> 53:24.284
[Taystee] Get this on tape!

53:24.368 --> 53:25.870
[Black Cindy] Anybody want some chips?

53:27.830 --> 53:29.623
I think that's all of 'em.

53:29.706 --> 53:31.250
Only minus the snacks in bellies.

53:31.333 --> 53:32.877
And tampons in vaginas.

53:32.960 --> 53:34.879
-Okay. We're good to go.
-[door opens]

53:34.962 --> 53:36.421
[panting] Yo, what the hell!

53:37.631 --> 53:38.966
We burning the bribe.

53:39.049 --> 53:41.969
Oh, fuck, yeah.
Yo, that's what I'm talking about, T.

53:42.887 --> 53:43.888
Uh-huh.

53:45.890 --> 53:47.099
Call her.

53:49.518 --> 53:52.479
Hi, Nita.
Welcome to the party.

53:53.814 --> 53:55.149
<i>What are you doing?</i>

53:55.232 --> 53:56.984
Flaming Cheetos, y'all!

53:57.067 --> 53:59.111
Hey, T, tell this woman what we want.

53:59.194 --> 54:01.781
We want to be motherfuckin' taken serious!

54:01.864 --> 54:03.157
-Hell, yeah!
-That's right!

54:03.240 --> 54:04.741
Bye, Nita!

54:04.825 --> 54:06.410
Bye, girl! Bye!

54:07.369 --> 54:08.954
-[officer] All right. Back up. Back up!
-[all exclaim]

54:09.038 --> 54:11.498
Whoa! Shit!

54:12.082 --> 54:14.001
Burn, bitch, burn!

54:14.084 --> 54:16.295
Fuck you, Piscatella! Yeah!
