00:47.882 --> 00:49.548
[all gasp]

00:49.550 --> 00:51.016
My mom told me about you.

00:51.085 --> 00:54.686
Your mother.
Where is she?

00:54.688 --> 00:55.987
She's dead.

00:56.123 --> 00:58.656
MURDOCH: When did you
last see your father?

00:58.692 --> 01:00.259
You're him, aren't you?

01:01.362 --> 01:02.494
I am.

01:02.629 --> 01:04.196
I'm going to ask
Effie to marry me.

01:04.198 --> 01:06.431
I bought the ring
and everything.

01:06.434 --> 01:07.766
-Where's Effie?
-I don't know.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.767
You're lying! Tell me!

01:09.804 --> 01:11.870
Let go of my
sister, George.

01:11.906 --> 01:13.672
-You?
-She made me do it.

01:13.741 --> 01:16.575
-She's lying.
-Eh, fine. Maybe I am.

01:17.578 --> 01:20.212
Miss Fulford put her earrings
in the drum with the body.

01:20.347 --> 01:22.314
To make it appear
as though she were dead.

01:22.449 --> 01:24.783
But her fingermarks
are on the lid.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.985
Where's Harry?

01:26.987 --> 01:29.188
He went to
the water closet.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.322
What's going on?

01:31.358 --> 01:33.558
Anna Fulford
might still be alive.

01:33.594 --> 01:34.927
MURDOCH:
Julia, he's gone.

[speaking French]

02:52.439 --> 02:53.871
Are you the police?

02:53.908 --> 02:55.007
Ah, yes.

02:55.142 --> 02:56.742
Finally.

02:56.877 --> 02:59.211
It started
about an hour ago.

02:59.346 --> 03:00.278
So you said.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.280
I told them to stop,
but they ignored me;

03:02.349 --> 03:04.016
probably don't even
know the language.

03:04.151 --> 03:05.584
Ah-ha.

03:05.653 --> 03:07.685
I don't know what
the devil they are doing,

03:07.721 --> 03:09.555
but it certainly isn't safe.

03:11.492 --> 03:13.892
You there.
What are you doing?

03:15.028 --> 03:17.095
Please, be quiet.

03:17.231 --> 03:19.998
Ah, you can't
be doing this.

03:20.067 --> 03:21.633
Please.

03:21.669 --> 03:24.369
We are saying goodbye
to our daughter.

03:24.371 --> 03:27.439
-Your daughter?
-Yes.

03:27.508 --> 03:30.642
Her soul is now
on its journey.

03:30.777 --> 03:34.246
The man who killed her
is inside the house.

03:35.416 --> 03:37.048
He is alive.

03:37.084 --> 03:39.284
-You are police?
-Yes.

03:39.286 --> 03:41.820
Then he is now
your responsibility.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.792
Now, please leave us
with our grief.

03:49.630 --> 03:50.963
All right.

04:17.057 --> 04:18.557
Are you all right?

04:21.228 --> 04:22.828
I want those
two arrested.

04:22.830 --> 04:25.430
They appear to want
the same for you.

04:25.565 --> 04:27.032
Why?

04:27.101 --> 04:29.200
They say you
killed their daughter.

04:29.236 --> 04:30.635
I killed?

04:30.638 --> 04:32.037
She's my wife!

04:32.172 --> 04:34.072
I did no such thing!

04:34.141 --> 04:36.375
Now get them
off my property.

04:39.246 --> 04:40.645
Where is your wife?

04:40.647 --> 04:42.514
I don't know.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.249
Ask them!

04:44.318 --> 04:46.118
They seem to
think she's dead.

04:46.253 --> 04:47.919
Maybe they're right.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.254
And why do you say that?

04:50.256 --> 04:52.557
I haven't seen
her in days.

04:56.596 --> 04:58.596
And so you burned
your daughter's body?

04:58.666 --> 05:00.732
It is our religion.

05:00.768 --> 05:03.468
And highly irregular.

05:03.470 --> 05:07.806
Shintoism requires
that the body be cremated.

05:07.941 --> 05:12.344
We were afraid that
it would not be allowed.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.945
You're probably
right.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.413
And you say her
husband killed her?

05:15.549 --> 05:16.948
Hai.

05:17.084 --> 05:20.218
And why do
you say that?

05:20.354 --> 05:23.288
He beat her. Often.

05:23.290 --> 05:26.891
She tried to leave. Often.

05:26.927 --> 05:30.762
And he also had
wife before Minori.

05:30.897 --> 05:33.631
He also had
her killed.

05:33.633 --> 05:35.567
You have proof
of this?

05:35.569 --> 05:37.002
I know.

05:38.505 --> 05:41.306
Please,
do not disturb her.

05:41.375 --> 05:45.043
Her ashes need to be
returned to the ground.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.512
Of course.
She is yours.

05:47.647 --> 05:51.182
[speaking Japanese]

05:51.218 --> 05:52.851
And you?

05:52.986 --> 05:54.586
Hm?

05:54.655 --> 05:58.623
What will you do to see that
our daughter receives justice?

07:42.295 --> 07:45.830
Ah, George!
You still look so surprised.

07:45.899 --> 07:48.099
Is it a good surprise?

07:48.101 --> 07:49.901
What have you
done with Effie?

07:49.903 --> 07:51.235
Effie, Effie, Effie.

07:51.271 --> 07:53.872
It's always
Effie, Effie, Effie.

07:53.874 --> 07:57.175
Effie had to
go away, George.

07:57.244 --> 07:59.578
Don't you understand that?
She wasn't right for you.

08:01.848 --> 08:04.582
You know,
I was married once before.

08:04.618 --> 08:07.986
I did not know that.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.654
Swore I would never
do it again.

08:09.789 --> 08:12.991
Well, that was before
you met Mr. Crabtree.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.059
Exactly.
It's funny how the right man

08:15.095 --> 08:16.528
can change a woman's mind.

08:16.597 --> 08:19.730
Oh, I'd say
that cuts both ways.

08:19.766 --> 08:21.733
Indeed.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.702
[both laugh]

08:23.837 --> 08:25.469
A little liquid courage?

08:25.506 --> 08:28.139
Oh, Dorothy,
you're a devil.

08:28.274 --> 08:29.140
Mm.

08:29.209 --> 08:31.610
I am that.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.212
Okay.

08:35.249 --> 08:37.082
Oh.

08:45.492 --> 08:46.624
Friendship.

08:46.660 --> 08:47.959
Miss Newsome
does like a drink,

08:48.094 --> 08:49.694
but I'm sure
you knew that, George.

08:49.763 --> 08:51.563
She's no good for you.

08:51.698 --> 08:54.031
Well-liberated women
love their libations,

08:54.067 --> 08:55.266
so it didn't take long.

08:55.335 --> 08:57.102
No good for you at all.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.317
Um... Uh.

09:12.386 --> 09:15.987
She is a long woman.

09:16.023 --> 09:17.188
Oh, no.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.190
For a time I thought
I had given her too much.

09:19.226 --> 09:22.127
-If you've harmed her--
-Oh, please, George.

09:22.262 --> 09:23.928
Sit down.

09:23.931 --> 09:25.430
She was alive and breathing
when we left her.

09:25.499 --> 09:27.999
What condition she's in now
is entirely up to her.

09:31.305 --> 09:34.306
We've done it.
We've done it.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.445
Let's get out of here.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.320
So when are we
going to do it?

09:48.455 --> 09:49.553
Soon.

09:49.590 --> 09:51.322
You'll have to make your
preparations, George.

09:51.391 --> 09:53.491
Does it not matter
that I don't love her?

09:53.627 --> 09:54.759
No, but you will!

09:54.894 --> 09:57.829
Once you get to
know me better.

09:57.898 --> 09:59.898
And I want it to be proper,
in a church.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.532
You hear that, George?

10:01.568 --> 10:02.734
Yes, I heard.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.969
Oh! And George?

10:05.005 --> 10:09.641
Only two people in this world
know where Miss Newsome is.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.777
You tell a soul, and we will
both go to our graves

10:12.912 --> 10:16.114
without telling anyone
where to find her.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.216
This is madness.

10:18.351 --> 10:21.486
The road to true love
never follows a straight line.

10:22.823 --> 10:24.856
You really are
the poet in the family.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.800
HART: So, it's a busy day,
but I shouldn't be too late.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.271
This seems to
be right one.

10:40.273 --> 10:41.840
Good.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.076
Everything signed.

10:45.112 --> 10:46.544
Thank you.

10:46.613 --> 10:48.546
I'll see you tonight.

10:48.548 --> 10:49.748
Don't get up to
anything I wouldn't.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.086
I'm hoping Freddie
has gotten to her,

10:55.221 --> 10:57.689
but I haven't found Anna.

10:57.691 --> 11:00.024
And what about Harry?

11:00.093 --> 11:03.595
He's been to the flat,
but no sign of him.

11:03.730 --> 11:05.029
Are they safe?

11:05.065 --> 11:06.631
MURDOCH:
I certainly hope so.

11:06.766 --> 11:09.567
Are you well, William?

11:09.636 --> 11:12.169
As well
as can be expected.

11:12.171 --> 11:16.040
You'll find her, William.

11:16.042 --> 11:17.809
I'm sure of it,
both of them.

11:17.811 --> 11:19.744
Of course.

11:22.516 --> 11:24.282
And what will you do
when you find them?

11:24.417 --> 11:27.018
I'll make sure that
they're both safe.

11:27.153 --> 11:29.054
Of course.

11:30.857 --> 11:32.223
William, I have to go.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.026
I love you, Julia.

11:35.161 --> 11:36.427
As do I.

11:36.496 --> 11:37.962
Goodbye.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.267
Doctor?

11:42.402 --> 11:44.002
There's a patient
I need you to see.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.338
-A day off?
-Just one, sir.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.274
Have you not noticed
all the empty desks?

11:49.409 --> 11:50.675
It's important.

11:50.677 --> 11:51.876
I don't think I can.

11:52.011 --> 11:53.945
Well, then, I quit.

11:54.014 --> 11:55.747
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Crabtree.
Hold your horses.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.281
What's so bloody
important?

11:57.283 --> 12:00.251
Sir, it's a personal matter
I'm inclined not to share.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.754
Look, take it
if you need it.

12:02.756 --> 12:03.988
Thank you.

12:05.125 --> 12:08.292
Thomas, what is going on?
Where's Bobby?

12:08.328 --> 12:10.495
-I don't know.
-Are you even looking?

12:10.564 --> 12:11.963
Of course I'm looking!

12:12.032 --> 12:13.631
Well, it certainly
doesn't look like it.

12:13.633 --> 12:16.100
What it looks like is that
you're sitting on your backside

12:16.103 --> 12:17.969
while our son
is in trouble!

12:17.971 --> 12:21.305
You believe them,
don't you?

12:21.341 --> 12:23.608
You believe our
son's a murderer?

12:28.081 --> 12:30.248
Constable, I need you to
dig up some information

12:30.250 --> 12:32.116
on a Mr. Jack Larkin.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.118
-I can't.
-It would be a great help.

12:34.187 --> 12:35.920
I said I can't.

12:36.055 --> 12:37.655
-George?
-What?

12:37.657 --> 12:39.457
What's wrong?

12:39.592 --> 12:41.258
I can't
talk about it.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.361
Well, maybe I could help.

12:45.064 --> 12:48.299
Actually,
maybe you could.

12:50.837 --> 12:53.204
I like the Blues' chances.
They're a strong side.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.740
Are you joking?
For the Grey Cup?

12:55.875 --> 12:57.675
-That's what it's called?
-Yeah, it was just announced.

12:57.744 --> 13:00.411
And you think the Blues
will beat the Canoe Club?

13:00.547 --> 13:02.213
They have a good chance.

13:02.215 --> 13:03.281
50 cents says--

13:03.350 --> 13:04.816
You were told to
stay away from my son!

13:04.885 --> 13:06.017
Now get here!

13:06.086 --> 13:07.085
And I did, Tom!

13:07.220 --> 13:08.353
Don't lie to me.

13:08.355 --> 13:09.621
-Sir?
-Stay out of this, constable!

13:09.756 --> 13:11.555
You sent a man
to attack him.

13:11.591 --> 13:12.824
I did no such thing.

13:12.826 --> 13:14.158
Now get your
hands off of me.

13:14.194 --> 13:15.626
I will when I'm
finished with ya!

13:15.662 --> 13:18.162
You let go of me now,
or I will have you arrested

13:18.231 --> 13:20.064
for attacking
a fellow officer.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.368
Fellow officer?

13:24.404 --> 13:25.937
You're hardly that.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.441
The chief constable
came to me,

13:30.443 --> 13:32.510
gave me a stern warning,
which I obeyed.

13:32.579 --> 13:35.446
Unlike you and your boy,
I have no problem

13:35.482 --> 13:37.715
living under the rules
which govern us.

13:37.784 --> 13:40.585
Who's the man
that attacked my boy?

13:40.654 --> 13:41.719
How would I know?

13:41.855 --> 13:43.855
The warden said you put
him in the same cell.

13:43.857 --> 13:45.389
I arrested the man!

13:45.425 --> 13:47.458
I hardly put him
in the cell.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.793
I'm not to blame
for this, Tom.

13:49.830 --> 13:54.465
Now, your boy has got the blood
of two dead men on his hands.

13:54.467 --> 13:57.468
I think it's time you look
to your own business.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.113
I thought she
was a good woman.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.149
And what made you
think she wasn't?

14:11.284 --> 14:14.285
I had just hired her.
She worked three days.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.887
I paid her a week's
wages in advance.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.489
-Where'd she go?
-I don't care now.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.758
I didn't ask you that.

14:20.894 --> 14:24.028
She mentioned something about
visiting a policeman in Toronto.

14:24.163 --> 14:26.164
I imagine you're him?

14:28.101 --> 14:30.034
Then she didn't
return for any reason?

14:30.169 --> 14:32.837
As far as I know, she went to
Toronto and never came back.

14:35.242 --> 14:38.309
-Thank you.
-Four dollars.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.577
I beg your pardon?

14:39.712 --> 14:42.547
If you see her,
she owes me four dollars.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.415
Not everything
grows on trees.

14:50.924 --> 14:54.158
[both speak French]

15:02.535 --> 15:06.804
Freddie Pink, I presume.

15:06.840 --> 15:11.275
One word and you say
goodbye to the boy.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.945
Or the boy says goodbye
to you first.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.346
You choose.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.292
HART: Well, they certainly
burned something.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.962
Didn't the family say
the remains were sacred?

15:31.097 --> 15:32.296
They did.

15:32.299 --> 15:34.299
But we do have
a job to do, don't we?

15:34.434 --> 15:36.700
Is there a way to
ascertain if that bone

15:36.736 --> 15:38.702
is from their
daughter's body?

15:38.838 --> 15:41.639
I'm no magician,
but I doubt they're lying.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.441
And why's that?

15:43.510 --> 15:45.710
I know what lying
looks like, detective.

15:45.712 --> 15:48.980
I've no doubt you do,
Mrs. Carmichael.

15:48.982 --> 15:51.182
Well, if that is all,

15:51.251 --> 15:52.984
I have a reservation
I must keep.

15:53.053 --> 15:56.454
If you don't mind me saying,
I can't help notice

15:56.589 --> 15:58.922
a certain spring
in your step.

15:58.959 --> 16:01.459
Are your romantic
problems behind you?

16:01.461 --> 16:03.527
They're certainly
on their way out.

16:03.596 --> 16:06.130
Hm. I envy you.

16:07.533 --> 16:09.200
She may be with
another woman.

16:09.202 --> 16:11.536
Detective Murdoch,
I can't help you.

16:11.538 --> 16:14.104
This is a city of
half a million people.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.839
Surely you could spare
an officer or two.

16:15.875 --> 16:17.208
My men, they have
their duties.

16:17.343 --> 16:19.744
Sir, she's being pursued
by the Black Hand.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.614
Then she is
already dead.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.115
I don't believe
that to be the case.

16:25.151 --> 16:27.085
Anna Fulford
is a very clever woman.

16:27.087 --> 16:30.087
Cleverness does not
trump brutality.

16:30.123 --> 16:32.623
I believe quite
the opposite.

16:32.625 --> 16:36.928
Then your experience with
the Black Hand is limited.

16:41.401 --> 16:42.967
Excuse me, sir.

16:43.036 --> 16:45.569
Are you Detective
William Murdoch?

16:45.605 --> 16:46.971
Yes.

16:46.973 --> 16:48.906
Oh, mon Dieu. Mon Dieu.
It is an honour.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.641
I have studied
your accomplishments

16:50.677 --> 16:51.909
with great interest.

16:51.978 --> 16:53.644
It is an honour.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.448
Thank you.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.116
I can help you.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.786
Your inspector stated...

17:01.788 --> 17:04.121
Ah! He thinks little of me.
He won't even know I'm missing.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.924
Please, you might actually
find me quite useful.

17:06.926 --> 17:08.525
If only to be your guide.

17:08.561 --> 17:11.395
Or do you know
the city well enough already?

17:11.397 --> 17:13.230
I could use the help.

17:13.266 --> 17:16.167
Then you shall have it. Now,
let's locate your lost love.

17:16.302 --> 17:18.069
Oh! She's not my lost love.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.704
Ah! Let's find her, anyway.

17:20.774 --> 17:22.507
William Murdoch!

17:24.444 --> 17:26.010
I say bring
the family in first.

17:26.145 --> 17:27.612
Not Mr. Larkin?

17:27.747 --> 17:29.346
What cause would
you have to do that?

17:29.416 --> 17:31.015
A bad feeling.

17:31.150 --> 17:32.549
Not enough.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.218
Find out
if there's any truth

17:34.220 --> 17:35.686
to what
the family is saying.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.088
They're saying
he's a murderer.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.257
Doesn't make him one.

17:42.796 --> 17:46.097
Uh, any news on
your son, inspector?

17:46.099 --> 17:49.834
Just that a lot of people
are calling him a murderer.

17:49.836 --> 17:52.136
Do you want to convict
him as well, Watts?

17:57.677 --> 17:59.843
Are you sure?
He's close to death.

17:59.879 --> 18:02.579
His condition
is untreatable.

18:02.615 --> 18:06.050
Are you saying the surgery
will not extend his life?

18:06.119 --> 18:07.985
Not by an
appreciable amount.

18:07.987 --> 18:11.489
He and his wife, Beatrice,
are very decent people.

18:11.624 --> 18:14.191
They have both been valued
friends to this hospital,

18:14.227 --> 18:16.527
they bankrolled
our pauper's ward.

18:16.662 --> 18:19.930
If your actions can grant them
a little more time together,

18:19.966 --> 18:22.600
I'd like to
give it to them.

18:22.669 --> 18:26.003
Well, I may be able to relieve
the pressure on his skull.

18:26.005 --> 18:28.739
Doctor Cushing's technique
has proven quite successful,

18:28.741 --> 18:30.675
but it won't
cure him.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.743
Then do it.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.278
And we hope for a miracle.

18:38.485 --> 18:39.684
You're the surgeon?

18:39.686 --> 18:41.752
Yes. Yes, I am.

18:41.754 --> 18:44.589
And you will help
my husband?

18:44.591 --> 18:46.791
I will do what I can.

18:48.327 --> 18:50.227
GEORGES: And, uh, the men
who are pursuing her,

18:50.263 --> 18:51.629
they are from Toronto?

18:51.631 --> 18:53.498
Yes, but they have
associates here.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.166
Oh, they certainly do.

18:55.168 --> 18:57.568
I can assure you, sir, Montreal
is not as pristine a place

18:57.604 --> 18:59.237
as the city fathers
would have you believe.

18:59.372 --> 19:01.104
Crime is highly
organized here.

19:01.141 --> 19:02.306
I'm aware.

19:02.375 --> 19:03.840
And there is no love lost
between the members

19:03.877 --> 19:05.643
of the Black Hand
and the Falcone family,

19:05.778 --> 19:07.912
contrary to what they
would have you believe.

19:07.914 --> 19:09.046
And what's that?

19:09.182 --> 19:11.382
That the organization
is one big, happy family.

19:11.517 --> 19:13.584
I can assure you,
it's far from that. Steamie?

19:14.988 --> 19:16.086
I beg your pardon?

19:16.156 --> 19:18.990
Is a hot dog,
steamed shut inside a bun.

19:19.125 --> 19:21.092
It's something
of a delicacy here.

19:21.094 --> 19:22.726
I think I'll defer,
thank you.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.729
Ah, your loss.
I'll take one.

19:24.864 --> 19:28.666
No, make it two.
This is an auspicious day.

19:28.735 --> 19:31.335
You were saying,
about the Falcones?

19:31.337 --> 19:33.671
-I was?
-And no love lost.

19:33.806 --> 19:35.072
Oh! Of course.

19:35.141 --> 19:37.541
Um, I was momentarily
lost in paradise.

19:37.610 --> 19:40.611
Uh, Falcone, the elder,
he had respect.

19:40.746 --> 19:43.414
His son is tolerated
for his name only.

19:43.416 --> 19:46.350
I think most of the organization
would be happy if he was gone.

19:46.352 --> 19:49.020
I may be able
to use that.

19:49.155 --> 19:50.154
That's the reason
I was providing you

19:50.289 --> 19:51.822
with the information, sir.

19:53.459 --> 19:55.459
Mm. C'est bon.

19:58.932 --> 20:01.165
So you were on duty
the day that my son escaped.

20:01.300 --> 20:03.000
You mean the day
he killed a man?

20:04.971 --> 20:06.103
What happened?

20:06.239 --> 20:08.305
The two of them had
words earlier that day.

20:08.341 --> 20:10.307
Then when they were in
the yard they fought.

20:10.443 --> 20:11.775
What kind of words?

20:11.844 --> 20:13.377
How would I know?

20:13.512 --> 20:15.246
Perhaps my boy
was justified.

20:15.381 --> 20:18.516
Every man in the place thinks
their actions are justified.

20:18.651 --> 20:21.686
Not every man settles
his problems with one of these.

20:22.922 --> 20:25.356
That's the weapon your son
used on the other fellow.

20:25.491 --> 20:27.091
Where did he get that?

20:27.160 --> 20:29.227
Made it himself.

20:29.362 --> 20:30.962
Clever little bugger.

20:31.097 --> 20:32.729
Both of them ended
up in the infirmary,

20:32.765 --> 20:35.466
but your boy wasn't
as badly hurt as he let on.

20:35.601 --> 20:38.969
He overpowered the trusty
on duty and escaped.

20:39.005 --> 20:40.805
I see.

20:40.940 --> 20:43.474
Like I said,
clever little bugger.

20:43.609 --> 20:46.510
I know.
I heard you the first time.

20:48.514 --> 20:52.616
It was important she be
cremated in her home.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.084
Why?

20:54.120 --> 20:58.355
So her kami could be released
to the worlds beyond.

20:58.357 --> 20:59.957
Her kami?

21:00.026 --> 21:01.492
Her soul.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.094
Oh. I see.

21:03.229 --> 21:06.430
I don't expect you
to understand.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.432
No, no, no.
I understand completely.

21:08.501 --> 21:12.403
There are worlds aplenty
beyond our mortal grasp.

21:13.739 --> 21:15.072
Why are my parents here?

21:15.108 --> 21:16.774
I simply had
a few questions.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.776
Well, let them go.
They have done nothing wrong.

21:18.911 --> 21:20.311
Not exactly true.

21:20.313 --> 21:22.713
They did appear
to assault Mr. Larkin.

21:22.848 --> 21:26.116
Only to deliver him to you.
He killed my sister!

21:26.152 --> 21:27.317
Their daughter.

21:27.353 --> 21:28.919
Why isn't he here
instead of them?

21:28.921 --> 21:31.222
I have no reason
to bring him in.

21:31.357 --> 21:32.990
He's done it before,
you know.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.424
At least once.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.460
A Miss Catherine Wilson,
his first wife,

21:36.496 --> 21:39.330
mysteriously disappeared
and now my sister.

21:39.465 --> 21:40.865
We don't know...

21:41.000 --> 21:43.734
He brutalized her, sir.

21:43.770 --> 21:46.003
She tried to
leave many times.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.804
We wanted to
take her home.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.640
He wouldn't let her.

21:49.775 --> 21:52.109
And now she is dead.

21:52.244 --> 21:54.845
Would you please
let my parents grieve in peace?

21:56.316 --> 21:58.682
RHODES:
Where is Miss Fulford?

21:58.685 --> 22:00.084
I don't know.

22:00.219 --> 22:02.853
Please, don't lie to me.

22:04.557 --> 22:06.757
If you're with the boy,
you know where she is.

22:06.892 --> 22:09.193
That is a ridiculous
supposition.

22:12.832 --> 22:15.032
You're a very pretty woman,

22:15.034 --> 22:17.935
so I would like for
you to stay that way.

22:19.439 --> 22:23.274
I want you to know that,
uh, none of this is personal.

22:24.711 --> 22:25.910
I just have a job to do.

22:27.447 --> 22:29.579
My mom did nothing wrong.

22:29.615 --> 22:32.182
That's not for me
to decide, kid.

22:32.318 --> 22:35.652
Now, I don't know how you got
yourself messed up in all this,

22:35.688 --> 22:40.157
but I know you know more
than you're letting on.

22:42.995 --> 22:44.362
[grunting]

22:49.402 --> 22:50.767
I don't want to have
to kill the two of you,

22:50.803 --> 22:53.003
but if I have to, I have to.

22:53.005 --> 22:55.472
Do what you like to us,
if you want.

22:55.541 --> 22:59.009
But we are not
your real problem.

22:59.078 --> 23:02.413
No, my real problem
is Anna Fulford.

23:02.482 --> 23:05.416
No, it's not.
It's William Murdoch.

23:05.418 --> 23:07.284
And you're going to
have to get rid of him.

23:07.353 --> 23:08.618
I got no quarrel with him.

23:08.654 --> 23:10.221
He certainly
does with you.

23:10.223 --> 23:13.424
You're holding
his son captive.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.362
What's your point?

23:18.431 --> 23:20.096
I can bring him to you.

23:20.133 --> 23:23.033
If you let me
and the boy go free.

23:33.346 --> 23:34.778
Do I look pretty?

23:34.781 --> 23:37.380
-You look pretty as a picture.
-What kind of picture?

23:37.417 --> 23:39.316
Oh, you.

23:39.352 --> 23:40.851
Are you ready?

23:40.986 --> 23:42.186
Am I?

24:12.852 --> 24:17.121
PRIEST: I now pronounce you
man and wife.

24:24.530 --> 24:26.497
Oh, that's so special.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.783
I believe I was able
to substantially

24:46.785 --> 24:48.185
relieve the pressure.

24:48.187 --> 24:49.520
He should awaken soon.

24:49.655 --> 24:51.055
Thank you, doctor.

24:51.057 --> 24:53.190
So, it was a success?

24:53.325 --> 24:55.326
As much as it could
have been, yes.

24:55.328 --> 24:57.861
Will I be able to
bring him home?

24:57.864 --> 25:00.397
Honestly, I don't know.

25:03.069 --> 25:04.535
But you do believe
he will awaken?

25:04.670 --> 25:06.871
I do.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.542
Well, then, we take one
miracle at a time, don't we?

25:14.380 --> 25:15.613
Thank you, doctor.

25:20.152 --> 25:23.153
Andrew, it's Beatty.

25:25.424 --> 25:27.825
I'm right here
by your side, hm?

25:30.596 --> 25:31.962
For now and always.

25:37.837 --> 25:39.503
This isn't the first
woman in your life

25:39.638 --> 25:42.372
to meet an
unfortunate end, is it?

25:42.507 --> 25:46.644
I am simply a man who's lived
a life of tragic circumstance.

25:51.183 --> 25:53.283
You took your sweet time
getting here, Jones.

25:53.352 --> 25:55.085
-Apologies.
-Jack, are you all right?

25:55.220 --> 25:56.453
WATTS:
What's this all about?

25:56.522 --> 25:59.255
Miss Day here is prepared
to say that she was with

25:59.292 --> 26:00.924
Mr. Larkin for
the last three days

26:00.993 --> 26:02.726
before his wife's
disappearance.

26:02.728 --> 26:04.861
You mean before
his wife was killed?

26:04.997 --> 26:08.264
Uh, I was led to understand
there was no body.

26:08.301 --> 26:10.734
As there was no body
for Catherine Wilson.

26:10.869 --> 26:13.937
As far as I know, Catherine
walked into Lake Ontario

26:13.940 --> 26:15.605
with a sack of
rocks in her pocket.

26:15.641 --> 26:18.141
I grieved her
death deeply.

26:18.143 --> 26:21.578
So the source
of these accusations

26:21.647 --> 26:24.080
you've hurled at my client

26:24.116 --> 26:26.417
are based on a mound of ash

26:26.552 --> 26:28.586
and the ravings
of some Asians?

26:28.721 --> 26:30.754
You know, they never
wanted their daughter

26:30.790 --> 26:32.288
to marry a gaijin.

26:32.325 --> 26:33.490
That's what
they called me.

26:33.526 --> 26:36.693
So, why did you marry her?

26:36.828 --> 26:38.762
I was seduced.

26:38.897 --> 26:41.098
Those women are devils.

26:41.167 --> 26:43.533
How was it you were
found at your residence?

26:43.569 --> 26:46.069
I had been with Eliza
the two nights previous.

26:46.204 --> 26:47.371
He was.

26:47.440 --> 26:50.107
And I was intending to make
that arrangement permanent.

26:50.176 --> 26:51.775
We were very happy.

26:51.910 --> 26:54.244
And when I arrived home
they had already started

26:54.246 --> 26:55.912
that ghastly fire.

26:55.948 --> 26:58.649
The boy took me by surprise
and knocked me out.

26:58.651 --> 27:02.052
And now I am here facing
ridiculous accusations.

27:02.187 --> 27:05.321
We were well within our
rights to lay charges.

27:05.358 --> 27:07.991
But I understand
they are grieving.

27:08.060 --> 27:09.459
So, if you just let me go,

27:09.528 --> 27:11.862
the matter can be
considered done with.

27:13.499 --> 27:15.332
Are you prepared to
charge my client?

27:15.467 --> 27:18.168
-Well...
-No, we're not.

27:18.170 --> 27:19.770
Thank you.

27:24.176 --> 27:27.143
This woman, she means
something to you, right?

27:27.179 --> 27:28.946
She's the mother
of my son.

27:29.081 --> 27:30.146
Oh, your wife?

27:30.182 --> 27:31.481
No.

27:31.517 --> 27:33.817
Tangled web.
No offence.

27:33.853 --> 27:35.085
Oh.

27:35.220 --> 27:37.421
I saved her from
the Black Hand once.

27:37.490 --> 27:41.624
But then I reneged on
a deal that I would not keep.

27:41.661 --> 27:44.428
Since then, she's been
in their crosshairs.

27:44.497 --> 27:46.963
For some reason she
returned to Toronto.

27:46.965 --> 27:48.632
Why would she do that?

27:48.634 --> 27:52.035
Perhaps for me to meet my son,
or she had nowhere else to turn.

27:52.104 --> 27:53.604
May I be bold?

27:53.739 --> 27:55.005
Of course.

27:55.007 --> 27:56.906
There is something you
are not telling me.

27:56.942 --> 27:58.175
There is?

27:58.310 --> 28:01.377
Well, uh, you mentioned
another woman to my inspector.

28:01.414 --> 28:02.646
Who is she?

28:02.781 --> 28:04.047
Freddie Pink.

28:04.050 --> 28:06.049
Ah, the detective.

28:06.085 --> 28:07.518
You know her?

28:07.653 --> 28:10.254
Every policeman in Montreal
knows Freddie Pink.

28:10.389 --> 28:11.588
And not favourably.

28:11.724 --> 28:13.590
How is she
involved in this?

28:13.726 --> 28:15.592
When I learned of
Miss Fulford's location,

28:15.728 --> 28:17.327
I contacted Freddie Pink.

28:17.329 --> 28:19.863
She and I have
a long acquaintance.

28:19.865 --> 28:21.664
Oh, do you now?

28:21.701 --> 28:23.433
Not like that.

28:23.502 --> 28:25.269
If you say so.

28:25.404 --> 28:29.139
I dispatched Miss Pink
to find her and hide her.

28:29.175 --> 28:31.875
I believe she
may have done both.

28:32.010 --> 28:33.543
And, uh, the boy?

28:33.612 --> 28:35.212
That I don't know.

28:35.281 --> 28:37.748
We will find them.

28:37.750 --> 28:40.684
If Miss Fulford was dead,
we would already know it.

28:40.686 --> 28:42.286
Same with the boy.

28:42.288 --> 28:44.888
The Black Hand are not shy
about showing their power.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.422
Each death
is a warning to others

28:46.459 --> 28:48.726
that they are not
to be crossed.

28:50.429 --> 28:53.163
And you?
You're willing to cross them?

28:53.199 --> 28:55.499
Truth and justice, sir.

28:55.501 --> 28:57.868
There is no more
noble a calling.

29:12.418 --> 29:13.917
Andrew never thought
it was very manly,

29:13.919 --> 29:15.719
but I know down deep
he loved the smell.

29:15.788 --> 29:16.987
It's beautiful.

29:17.056 --> 29:20.857
We acquired it in Tibet
three years ago.

29:20.893 --> 29:22.793
It was a wonderful
journey.

29:22.795 --> 29:25.596
Feels like a lifetime ago.

29:27.566 --> 29:29.333
Doctor, is he comfortable?

29:29.468 --> 29:31.467
If he's showing no outward
signs of distress,

29:31.504 --> 29:33.604
then he's in no
pain right now.

29:33.606 --> 29:35.472
Thank you.

29:37.610 --> 29:40.010
I don't think we're
ever prepared, are we?

29:40.079 --> 29:42.346
To say goodbye?

29:42.348 --> 29:45.082
To the love of our life.

29:46.252 --> 29:48.285
No, I don't think we are.

29:57.830 --> 29:59.129
Oi.

30:09.408 --> 30:10.741
What do you want to
talk to us about?

30:10.876 --> 30:13.443
We haven't done
anything wrong.

30:13.445 --> 30:16.379
Living on the right side
of the law now, Inspector.

30:16.415 --> 30:18.582
Model citizens.

30:18.584 --> 30:21.185
I need you to find my son.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.186
He broke out of jail.

30:23.255 --> 30:24.921
Did you hear about that?

30:24.923 --> 30:26.924
We can ask around.

30:27.059 --> 30:28.959
What's in it for us?

30:39.104 --> 30:41.238
Same again if you
find him unharmed.

30:41.307 --> 30:42.973
We can't promise that.

30:43.042 --> 30:45.609
I didn't ask you
for a promise.

30:45.611 --> 30:48.712
You find him, you bring him to
me, no one else. Understood?

30:48.714 --> 30:52.415
No need to get
the law involved, right?

30:52.451 --> 30:55.219
Don't get smart
with me, sunshine.

31:01.026 --> 31:02.692
Ah. Qu'avez-vous, Georges?

31:02.728 --> 31:04.027
Excuse me.

31:04.063 --> 31:06.029
What have you... discovered?

31:06.098 --> 31:08.965
Ah. Guiseppe Leone,
the capo of the Black Hand,

31:09.001 --> 31:10.901
is planning to entertain
two visitors from Toronto

31:10.903 --> 31:12.035
this evening.

31:12.104 --> 31:13.370
He's not happy about it.

31:13.439 --> 31:14.704
The Falcones.

31:14.740 --> 31:17.240
The young Falcone and his
righthand man, Anthony Pucci.

31:17.309 --> 31:19.576
Was there any sense as
to whether they'd been

31:19.711 --> 31:21.912
successful in
finding Anna Fulford?

31:22.047 --> 31:23.847
They are alone,
so I would say no.

31:23.982 --> 31:25.549
And Frank Rhodes?

31:25.684 --> 31:27.283
Who's that?

31:27.319 --> 31:30.187
He's an assassin that
works for the Falcones.

31:30.189 --> 31:32.255
You keep adding names
to the list, sir.

31:32.258 --> 31:33.690
I, uh...

31:35.194 --> 31:37.661
This man.
If you see him, steer clear.

31:37.663 --> 31:39.329
He's very dangerous.

31:39.331 --> 31:41.598
We are swimming in
a sea of dangerous men.

31:41.733 --> 31:44.268
Ooh. Pardon the imagery.

31:46.639 --> 31:48.905
You haven't
touched your cake.

31:48.974 --> 31:50.307
Well...

31:52.077 --> 31:55.545
This will be
the perfect little love nest.

31:55.547 --> 31:57.547
For now.

32:00.018 --> 32:02.819
I have fulfilled
my side of the bargain.

32:02.821 --> 32:05.088
It's more than a bargain.

32:05.090 --> 32:07.357
It's a vow!

32:07.492 --> 32:08.959
In front of
God Almighty.

32:09.028 --> 32:11.328
It's a promise
of love everlasting!

32:13.132 --> 32:15.098
You promised
you'd get Effie.

32:15.233 --> 32:17.734
Not until you
eat your cake.

32:22.207 --> 32:23.774
Oops.

32:35.921 --> 32:38.555
Harry! Harry!

32:38.557 --> 32:39.756
Harry, stop!

32:45.230 --> 32:46.563
Harry!

32:51.403 --> 32:54.805
Harry.
That's enough. Stop!

32:57.910 --> 32:59.309
Good job, kid.

33:00.713 --> 33:02.079
Now, come on.

33:17.229 --> 33:19.962
Sure you got some
catching up to do.

33:19.999 --> 33:22.232
Never send a woman
to do a man's job.

33:27.506 --> 33:29.305
-Is Anna safe?
-Hello to you, too!

33:29.341 --> 33:31.508
I got her on
a train to New York.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.643
She is to wait there
for further instruction.

33:33.679 --> 33:35.445
I have a friend
I trust with her.

33:35.481 --> 33:37.213
I'm sorry I got
you into this.

33:37.249 --> 33:38.715
Oh, don't be!
It was my idea.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.450
Your idea?

33:40.585 --> 33:41.918
I figured you'd
be bright enough

33:41.920 --> 33:43.887
to get all three
of us out of this.

34:27.366 --> 34:29.432
So, where will we live?

34:29.501 --> 34:31.501
I do like the city,

34:31.503 --> 34:34.037
but I must admit
I'm more of a country mouse.

34:34.106 --> 34:37.106
But I suppose we should stay
in the city for a while.

34:37.142 --> 34:40.444
So you can move up
the ladder...

34:41.513 --> 34:43.446
In your job.

34:43.515 --> 34:47.517
But will our children
be safe here?

34:47.553 --> 34:49.652
The city is such
a dangerous place.

34:49.688 --> 34:52.589
What do you think?

34:54.126 --> 34:55.959
I don't have
an opinion either way.

34:59.998 --> 35:01.665
Oh. Um...

35:01.800 --> 35:04.601
Well, there is time.

35:04.670 --> 35:08.505
And we do need time,
don't we, Georgie?

35:19.351 --> 35:21.218
I suppose it is
rather a lot to take in.

35:22.521 --> 35:23.686
When is Dorothy
getting here?

35:23.688 --> 35:24.754
She'll be back!

35:24.756 --> 35:26.623
Presently.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.959
I'm sure of it.

35:29.094 --> 35:31.827
And I wouldn't
worry, George.

35:31.864 --> 35:33.597
About us, I mean.

35:36.234 --> 35:37.367
Many loving marriages have

35:37.369 --> 35:39.903
been born out
of stranger circumstances.

35:40.038 --> 35:41.304
Oh, yes, I'm sure.

35:41.306 --> 35:43.106
Who knows? Maybe one
day we'll be at a place

35:43.175 --> 35:45.909
where my wife doesn't need
to hold me at gunpoint?

35:50.749 --> 35:52.082
Your wife.

35:53.118 --> 35:54.851
Oh!

35:54.920 --> 35:58.387
Oh, I do love
the sound of that.

35:58.423 --> 36:00.523
Mrs. George Crabtree.

36:00.526 --> 36:01.992
-All right.
-Don't!

36:05.597 --> 36:06.897
Sit.

36:18.577 --> 36:19.909
You released him?

36:19.978 --> 36:21.545
There's no solid basis
on which to hold him.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.279
-He killed my sister.
-There's no proof of that.

36:23.415 --> 36:24.548
It's obvious.

36:24.683 --> 36:26.082
If it was,
there would be proof.

36:26.151 --> 36:28.151
-Do your job.
-I'm trying to.

36:28.220 --> 36:30.420
But, for now,
I had to let him go.

36:30.555 --> 36:31.788
The law requires
reasonable--

36:31.790 --> 36:33.490
You're a slave
to the law, then.

36:33.625 --> 36:34.891
Not in all cases.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.425
But in this one?

36:36.461 --> 36:38.494
As I told you,
I had to let him go.

36:38.530 --> 36:41.631
Then you're responsible
for what happens.

36:43.168 --> 36:44.935
Mr. Nakamura!

36:49.775 --> 36:51.308
You said you
had something.

36:51.443 --> 36:53.243
Good news.

36:53.245 --> 36:54.644
Son's alive.

36:56.949 --> 36:59.049
-Where is he?
-Don't know that for sure.

37:00.051 --> 37:03.719
Man I trust said he saw him
boarding a train at Union.

37:03.755 --> 37:05.521
Where was he going?

37:05.523 --> 37:07.057
He's headed west.

37:07.059 --> 37:08.892
Train goes all the way
to Vancouver.

37:09.027 --> 37:10.960
Anything else?

37:10.963 --> 37:15.198
Yeah, but, uh, might not
be what you want to hear.

37:15.333 --> 37:16.967
Go on.

37:19.738 --> 37:21.404
Your boy killed
that man in prison.

37:21.406 --> 37:24.374
And he wasn't shy about
telling anyone who'd listen.

37:26.077 --> 37:28.544
Well, when you want people
to keep their distance,

37:28.580 --> 37:31.814
you lie about being
a dangerous man.

37:31.850 --> 37:34.551
Yeah, sure, inspector.

37:34.686 --> 37:36.853
That's probably all it is.

37:41.893 --> 37:44.027
There's a chance I may be
able to save your husband.

37:44.096 --> 37:46.296
Oh, Lord.

37:46.431 --> 37:49.165
There's a tumour
near his pituitary gland

37:49.201 --> 37:51.034
and I may be able
to remove it.

37:51.169 --> 37:52.502
Then do it.

37:52.637 --> 37:54.971
It's an operation that
I've never done before.

37:55.106 --> 37:58.040
Very few have.

37:58.076 --> 38:01.344
It's a very
risky procedure.

38:04.349 --> 38:05.648
What would you do?

38:05.651 --> 38:07.216
It's not my decision.

38:07.252 --> 38:11.087
I understand.
But what would you do?

38:17.062 --> 38:18.794
Given the choice between
my husband's certain death

38:18.830 --> 38:21.331
and a chance
at his survival,

38:21.333 --> 38:25.268
no matter how slim,
I would take it.

38:26.938 --> 38:29.205
Then I put my
faith in you.

38:35.747 --> 38:37.414
Is the boy safe?

38:37.416 --> 38:40.550
If Rhodes wanted him dead
he would have done it already.

38:40.619 --> 38:42.752
He may be awaiting
further instructions.

38:42.754 --> 38:44.854
Or getting them now.

38:52.431 --> 38:55.364
None of this is your fault.

38:55.400 --> 38:56.899
I feel like it is.

38:56.935 --> 38:59.035
Well, it isn't.

39:04.309 --> 39:07.243
How would you like to
help us to get out of here?

39:16.588 --> 39:18.188
And this is
the last of them?

39:18.323 --> 39:19.522
Yes.

39:19.558 --> 39:22.325
And Mr. Carmichael is in
agreement with all of this?

39:22.394 --> 39:23.793
His signature
is right there.

39:23.928 --> 39:25.362
Of course he is.

39:25.497 --> 39:29.599
Well, congratulations,
Mrs. Carmichael.

39:29.668 --> 39:31.200
You are now
a wealthy woman.

39:31.269 --> 39:33.803
Carmichael House alone
is worth well over...

39:33.805 --> 39:35.872
I'm well aware
of what it is worth.

39:35.941 --> 39:38.441
Well, if that is it,
then I shall be off.

39:40.145 --> 39:42.011
Ah! There is one more thing.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.214
I would like to revert
to my given name.

39:44.349 --> 39:46.216
I am no longer
Mrs. Arthur Carmichael.

39:46.218 --> 39:48.017
I am Mrs. Violet Hart.

39:48.053 --> 39:50.687
As you wish.

39:50.822 --> 39:52.956
I do wish.

39:55.360 --> 39:58.061
I need your assistance,
Mrs. Hart.

40:13.111 --> 40:14.777
Good lord!

40:14.780 --> 40:17.346
-Detective Watts?
-Yes.

40:17.382 --> 40:18.581
She's still alive.

40:21.586 --> 40:23.553
The lucky one,
it appears.

40:33.165 --> 40:34.997
Bad news,
I'm afraid.

40:35.033 --> 40:39.135
Seems the powers that be aren't
interested in the detective.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.804
They want Miss Fulford.

40:41.873 --> 40:43.740
That's who I've
been looking for.

40:43.875 --> 40:46.009
Not asking you.

40:46.011 --> 40:47.610
Where is she?

40:47.745 --> 40:50.012
I was looking
for her, too.

40:50.048 --> 40:52.749
She's an elusive bird,
isn't she?

40:52.884 --> 40:56.519
No less than three searchers
and she's evaded them all.

40:58.356 --> 41:00.155
Hey, where's the kid?

41:00.192 --> 41:01.291
Now, Harry!

41:10.135 --> 41:11.968
You two make a good team.

41:14.039 --> 41:15.505
I suppose we do.

41:21.880 --> 41:23.913
-Effie!
-George! George.

41:24.048 --> 41:24.980
Are you all right?

41:25.016 --> 41:27.250
No touching!
Get down.

41:29.688 --> 41:30.854
You're a married man now.

41:32.457 --> 41:33.790
Married?

41:33.792 --> 41:38.761
George, wh-wh-what are
they talking about?

41:38.763 --> 41:42.298
I am now
Mrs. George Crabtree.

41:47.205 --> 41:50.573
[sobs]

41:53.745 --> 41:56.078
What an absolutely
marvelous day!

41:56.114 --> 41:59.549
Juliette's had a sale
that was absolutely scandalous.

41:59.684 --> 42:01.951
Marcel will bring
dinner by later.

42:02.086 --> 42:03.820
Chateaubriand for two.

42:03.822 --> 42:06.589
I thought you'd
like to share with me.

42:08.626 --> 42:11.327
Oh! And thank you so much
for signing those papers.

42:16.701 --> 42:18.167
I'm really
starting to feel

42:18.236 --> 42:20.036
like we're true partners
in this marriage-

42:20.038 --> 42:21.838
like we're really
getting somewhere.

42:21.840 --> 42:24.707
You've made me so happy.

42:35.387 --> 42:36.986
So, what do you
plan on doing to me?

42:36.988 --> 42:40.056
Surrender you
to the Montreal police.

42:41.426 --> 42:43.259
Won't solve anything.

42:43.328 --> 42:46.061
I am just the bullet.

42:46.097 --> 42:48.798
Falcone's the gun.

42:48.933 --> 42:53.002
And all he's going to do
is find another bullet.

42:53.137 --> 42:55.671
I'll get him as well.

42:55.740 --> 42:58.408
Yeah. Yeah.

42:58.410 --> 43:00.809
And then one day
you slip up

43:00.845 --> 43:03.279
and the woman
and the boy are dead.

43:03.414 --> 43:05.014
Doesn't have
to be that way.

43:05.149 --> 43:08.084
You help me.

43:08.086 --> 43:10.820
I help you.

43:10.822 --> 43:14.423
Why should I trust you?

43:14.459 --> 43:18.027
I am a man for hire,
nothing more.

43:18.162 --> 43:21.965
Falcone's the one with
the burr under his saddle.

43:24.736 --> 43:26.636
I'll cancel the contract
for my freedom.

43:34.045 --> 43:36.312
You should listen
to me, detective.

43:36.447 --> 43:37.847
I'm the best
chance you've got.
