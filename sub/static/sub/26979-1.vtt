Uh, Rarity?

15:51.033 --> 15:53.453
Ah! Oh! Here we go.

15:53.494 --> 15:56.623
Your package was delivered

15:53.494 --> 15:56.623
to Sweet Apple Acres.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.541
What? It was supposed

15:56.664 --> 15:58.541
to be delivered

15:58.583 --> 16:00.543
to Rarity's Boutique!

16:00.585 --> 16:06.006
Um, OK but now the

16:00.585 --> 16:06.006
package was for Applejack,

16:06.048 --> 16:10.470
and she is at

16:06.048 --> 16:10.470
Sweet Apple Acres.

16:10.511 --> 16:16.476
Yes, it's for Applejack,

16:10.511 --> 16:16.476
but I will be delivering it.

16:16.517 --> 16:17.977
That's my job.

16:19.270 --> 16:24.024

16:24.066 --> 16:25.735
What if she opens it?

16:25.777 --> 16:28.446
It shouldn't go to

16:25.777 --> 16:28.446
Sweet Apple Acres!

16:28.488 --> 16:34.034
Oh! Wait. It went to Sweet

16:28.488 --> 16:34.034
Acorn Orchard instead.

16:34.076 --> 16:37.246
That's a relief!

16:37.288 --> 16:39.540
Why is that a relief?

16:39.582 --> 16:44.462
Because Applejack's not

16:39.582 --> 16:44.462
in Sweet Acorn Orchard.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.715
Do you want me to get the

16:44.504 --> 16:47.715

16:53.053 --> 16:54.931

16:54.973 --> 16:57.350

16:54.973 --> 16:57.350

24:26.966 --> 24:29.009
You only know what's

24:26.966 --> 24:29.009
already happened.

24:29.051 --> 24:31.511
But you don't know

24:29.051 --> 24:31.511
what she's about to ask!

24:31.553 --> 24:33.806
What am I about to ask?

24:33.847 --> 24:36.267
How did you know I

24:33.847 --> 24:36.267
was gonna say that?

24:36.309 --> 24:38.352
Will you two stop

24:36.309 --> 24:38.352
showing off?

24:38.394 --> 24:40.604
She doesn't have all

24:38.394 --> 24:40.604
Hearth's Warming!

24:40.646 --> 24:42.856
Who are you reindeer?

24:42.898 --> 24:43.899
Aurora.

24:43.941 --> 24:44.691
Bori!

24:44.733 --> 24:45.609
Alice.

24:45.651 --> 24:48.528
The gift givers of the grove.

24:48.570 --> 24:51.824
Oooo! And you can help me get

24:48.570 --> 24:51.824
Twilight the best gift ever?

24:51.865 --> 24:53.367
Mmhmm!

24:53.409 --> 24:56.745
What about those matching

24:53.409 --> 24:56.745
hats? They were so cute!

24:56.787 --> 24:58.538
Well, that was--

24:58.580 --> 25:00.958
Before she had to get just

24:58.580 --> 25:00.958
one gift for Twilight.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.668
Try to keep up, Aurora.

25:02.709 --> 25:05.503
I'm gonna get that box Pinkie

25:02.709 --> 25:05.503
is gonna say she likes.

25:07.214 --> 25:09.549
Aurora remembers gifts

25:07.214 --> 25:09.549
that have already happened.

25:09.591 --> 25:12.261
Alice knows the gifts

25:09.591 --> 25:12.261
that are going to happen.

25:12.303 --> 25:14.305
I... just stay in the moment

25:14.347 --> 25:16.182
and keep the two

25:14.347 --> 25:16.182
of them in line.

25:16.223 --> 25:20.144
Speaking of. I believe we

25:16.223 --> 25:20.144
have a request for a gift?

25:21.603 --> 25:24.773
The best gift is more

25:21.603 --> 25:24.773
precious than gold,

25:24.815 --> 25:27.567
but it cannot be sold.

25:27.609 --> 25:31.738
When it breaks, it's not ended,

25:27.609 --> 25:31.738
for quickly it's mended.

25:31.780 --> 25:35.075
It can never be bought,

25:31.780 --> 25:35.075
yet is easily sought.

25:35.117 --> 25:37.161
Ah! Here we go.

25:40.622 --> 25:43.583
Oooo. I like that box!

25:43.625 --> 25:44.584
Told you!

25:48.005 --> 25:51.008
The perfect gift. Wow.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.592
I don't get it.

25:52.634 --> 25:54.178
You will.

25:57.431 --> 26:00.600
We said no refunds!

26:00.642 --> 26:01.810
Ahem!

26:01.852 --> 26:03.603
Oh. You.

26:03.645 --> 26:05.689
What are y'all doin'

26:03.645 --> 26:05.689
with these dolls

26:05.731 --> 26:07.358
and that

26:05.731 --> 26:07.358
ridiculous getup?

26:07.400 --> 26:08.942
Don't you have a

26:07.400 --> 26:08.942
resort to run?

26:08.984 --> 26:13.155
It's off-season. Besides,

26:08.984 --> 26:13.155
we're planning an expansion.

26:13.197 --> 26:16.200
And expansions cost bits.

26:17.868 --> 26:21.579
Flim and Flam's

26:17.868 --> 26:21.579
Fro Yo Flume ride!

26:21.621 --> 26:22.622
That sounds fun!

26:22.664 --> 26:25.625
It ain't no excuse for sellin'

26:22.664 --> 26:25.625
cheap dolls to ponies.

26:25.667 --> 26:28.462
We're just giving

26:25.667 --> 26:28.462
ponies what they want!

26:28.504 --> 26:31.631
Shopping for the perfect

26:28.504 --> 26:31.631
gift is stressful.

26:31.673 --> 26:33.467
Oh, that's true.

26:33.509 --> 26:36.636
You want to get something

26:33.509 --> 26:36.636
that really stands out.

26:36.678 --> 26:38.556
[grunt]

26:38.596 --> 26:40.640
And when you tell your friend

26:38.596 --> 26:40.640
you got them the hottest gift

26:40.682 --> 26:43.977
in Rainbow Falls,

26:40.682 --> 26:43.977
what'll they say?

26:44.019 --> 26:45.938
Woo hoo?

26:45.979 --> 26:50.650
The more you spend,

26:45.979 --> 26:50.650
the more your friend

26:45.979 --> 26:50.650
knows you love them!

26:50.692 --> 26:52.403
[thud]

26:52.445 --> 26:57.074
Oh. Right. They really are

26:52.445 --> 26:57.074
good at selling things.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.658
You may not like it.

26:58.700 --> 27:02.662
But technically, we're

26:58.700 --> 27:02.662
not doing anything wrong.

27:02.704 --> 27:05.499
Ponies are desperate

27:02.704 --> 27:05.499
for the right gift.

27:05.541 --> 27:09.253
And who are you to tell

27:05.541 --> 27:09.253
them this isn't it?

27:09.295 --> 27:13.006
If ponies get tired of

27:09.295 --> 27:13.006
Holly after a few days...

27:13.048 --> 27:16.093
...or she falls apart,

27:13.048 --> 27:16.093
who really got hurt?

27:16.135 --> 27:18.512
Nopony!

27:18.554 --> 27:21.181
Don't let the curtain

27:18.554 --> 27:21.181
hit ya on the way out.

27:21.223 --> 27:23.976
Of course Rainbow Dash

27:21.223 --> 27:23.976
wouldn't want this.

27:24.017 --> 27:26.686
I'm so mad I

27:24.017 --> 27:26.686
could just kick...

27:26.728 --> 27:28.606
[clink]

27:28.646 --> 27:30.483
Convincin' ponies

27:28.646 --> 27:30.483
to buy that doll

27:30.524 --> 27:32.526
ain't in the

27:30.524 --> 27:32.526
holiday spirit.

27:32.568 --> 27:34.320
But Flim and Flam

27:32.568 --> 27:34.320
have a point.

27:34.361 --> 27:36.654
We can't tell

27:34.361 --> 27:36.654
ponies what to buy.

27:41.368 --> 27:43.661
But maybe we

27:41.368 --> 27:43.661
can show 'em!

27:50.586 --> 27:52.879
Could you try to

27:50.586 --> 27:52.879
make less noise?

27:55.257 --> 27:56.091
Of course!

27:56.133 --> 27:58.218
[snap zap]

27:58.260 --> 28:02.139
Move silently;

27:58.260 --> 28:02.139
blend into the shadows.

28:02.181 --> 28:04.808
The winterchilla will

28:02.181 --> 28:04.808
never hear us coming.

28:04.850 --> 28:06.893
Winter... chilla?

28:06.935 --> 28:09.647
Small, adorable,

28:06.935 --> 28:09.647
fuzzy and fast.

28:09.687 --> 28:12.316
But they're so rare, there's

28:09.687 --> 28:12.316
no telling where they...

28:12.358 --> 28:13.691
Oh, there's one

28:12.358 --> 28:13.691
right there!

28:15.902 --> 28:17.737
Now, if you're

28:15.902 --> 28:17.737
going to get it,

28:17.779 --> 28:19.739
I think the first

28:17.779 --> 28:19.739
move is to be--

28:19.781 --> 28:20.740
[whoosh]

28:20.782 --> 28:21.699
Be super-fast?

28:24.786 --> 28:29.583
Making a gift is way more

28:24.786 --> 28:29.583
personal than buying it.

28:29.625 --> 28:31.709
Rarity loves things that

28:29.625 --> 28:31.709
take time and effort.

28:33.795 --> 28:35.755
I'm sure this one will

28:33.795 --> 28:35.755
be the one that works.

28:37.799 --> 28:41.261
I just... need to

28:37.799 --> 28:41.261
stay focused and...

28:41.303 --> 28:45.891
[snoring]

28:45.932 --> 28:51.938
Have a wonderful holiday and

28:45.932 --> 28:51.938
remember, no refunds! Next?

28:51.980 --> 28:54.191
And what are you doing here?

28:54.233 --> 28:56.735
Same as everypony else!

28:56.776 --> 29:01.781
I want a hearthwarmer!

28:56.776 --> 29:01.781
In fact, I want three!

29:01.823 --> 29:02.991
Seriously?

29:03.033 --> 29:07.871
After I saw my friend here with

29:03.033 --> 29:07.871
hers, I knew I had to buy some!

29:07.913 --> 29:12.209
For my granny, my brother

29:07.913 --> 29:12.209
and my little sister!

29:12.251 --> 29:13.960
Yeah yeah, great story. Next!

29:14.002 --> 29:19.091
But Applejack. Your granny,

29:14.002 --> 29:19.091
your brother and your sister.

29:19.132 --> 29:21.927
They are all so different!

29:21.968 --> 29:27.391
How can the same doll be the

29:21.968 --> 29:27.391
right gift for all of them?

29:27.433 --> 29:29.976
Oh. Well, that might be true.

29:30.018 --> 29:35.524
But Fluttershy, this is the

29:30.018 --> 29:35.524
must-have gift of the season.

29:35.566 --> 29:38.110
Just because it's

29:35.566 --> 29:38.110
must-have for one pony

29:38.151 --> 29:43.031
doesn't mean it's must-have

29:38.151 --> 29:43.031
for everypony. Does it?

29:43.073 --> 29:45.242
That's true!

29:45.284 --> 29:47.661
I guess I need to

29:45.284 --> 29:47.661
put more thought

29:47.703 --> 29:50.830
into gettin' the right

29:47.703 --> 29:50.830
gift for each pony.

29:50.872 --> 29:52.040
Can I return these?

29:52.082 --> 29:53.709
No refunds!

29:57.463 --> 29:59.839
Oh. Uh... you want 'em?

29:59.881 --> 30:02.551
I'm gonna go pick out gifts

29:59.881 --> 30:02.551
that are just as special

30:02.593 --> 30:04.844
as the ponies they're for.

30:04.886 --> 30:08.641
I... think I'm going to go

30:04.886 --> 30:08.641
do some more shopping too.

30:08.682 --> 30:10.850
Now hang on a moment.

30:10.892 --> 30:12.686
Wait! Come back!

30:12.728 --> 30:14.854
We'll give you

30:12.728 --> 30:14.854
a great deal!

30:14.896 --> 30:16.856
Buy one get one free?

30:18.900 --> 30:22.738
Ah. The sweet sounds

30:18.900 --> 30:22.738
of the season.

30:27.909 --> 30:30.245
It's a shame you gotta leave.

30:30.287 --> 30:32.872
You've been so generous,

30:30.287 --> 30:32.872
but I must get home

30:32.914 --> 30:34.833
for a previous engagement.

30:34.874 --> 30:38.253
I'll be keeping an

30:34.874 --> 30:38.253
eye on you, Pistachio.

30:38.295 --> 30:41.757
I've a feeling you've got

30:38.295 --> 30:41.757
quite the future in fashion!

30:45.469 --> 30:49.473
Rarity! Rarity! I

30:45.469 --> 30:49.473
love my parents,

30:49.515 --> 30:52.309
but they don't understand

30:49.515 --> 30:52.309
that we just had lunch

30:52.351 --> 30:55.437
with one of the most famous

30:52.351 --> 30:55.437
ponies in Equestria.

30:55.479 --> 30:58.524
I don't know about

30:55.479 --> 30:58.524
"most famous".

30:58.565 --> 30:59.899
Ha ha!

30:59.941 --> 31:02.653
I know you didn't send

30:59.941 --> 31:02.653
a Fedora Felt original

31:02.695 --> 31:07.533
to some nopony you've never

31:02.695 --> 31:07.533
met from nowhere, Equestria.

31:07.574 --> 31:10.703
I'm sure this is actually

31:07.574 --> 31:10.703
for somepony special

31:10.744 --> 31:13.706
so if you want it

31:10.744 --> 31:13.706
back, I get it.

31:16.041 --> 31:18.669
The hat is indeed for

31:16.041 --> 31:18.669
somepony very special.

31:20.546 --> 31:23.923
And I couldn't bear to

31:20.546 --> 31:23.923
see him part with it.

31:23.965 --> 31:29.304
Oh, thank Celestia, because I

31:23.965 --> 31:29.304
did not want to give this up.

31:29.346 --> 31:32.516
But if I hear you call

31:29.346 --> 31:32.516
yourself a nopony again,

31:32.558 --> 31:36.854
you shan't be my guest for

31:32.558 --> 31:36.854
fashion week in Manehattan.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.105
[stuttering]

31:41.983 --> 31:43.276
Sorry, Applejack.

31:44.986 --> 31:49.449
[shouts]

31:49.491 --> 31:50.950
Puttin' those two

31:49.491 --> 31:50.950
in their places

31:50.992 --> 31:53.787
makes me all warm

31:50.992 --> 31:53.787
and fuzzy inside.

31:53.829 --> 31:57.249
Ooh. But we never got gifts

31:53.829 --> 31:57.249
for Spike or Rainbow Dash.

31:57.290 --> 32:00.043
And it's already

31:57.290 --> 32:00.043
Hearth's Warming Eve.

32:00.085 --> 32:01.961
It probably ain't what

32:00.085 --> 32:01.961
they're expectin',

32:02.003 --> 32:03.963
but we still got these.

32:04.005 --> 32:05.298
Yay?

32:05.340 --> 32:06.966
Don't do that.

32:07.008 --> 32:09.135
[splashes]

32:09.177 --> 32:11.346
Flurry loved sledding!

32:11.388 --> 32:13.557
Too bad her aunt

32:11.388 --> 32:13.557
wasn't there.

32:17.644 --> 32:19.062
Oooh!

32:19.104 --> 32:22.023
There! Ingredients

32:19.104 --> 32:22.023
measured exactly!

32:22.065 --> 32:23.983
Now, what were you saying?

32:24.025 --> 32:26.403
Hi! Remember us?

32:24.025 --> 32:26.403
We came all the way

32:26.445 --> 32:31.116
from the Crystal Empire for

32:26.445 --> 32:31.116
some quality family time?

32:31.157 --> 32:33.076
OK. I did get a

32:31.157 --> 32:33.076
little stressed

32:33.118 --> 32:34.703
about Hearth's

32:33.118 --> 32:34.703
Warming this year.

32:34.745 --> 32:36.996
[burble]

32:37.038 --> 32:39.165
What? You? Never!

32:39.207 --> 32:40.584
So my friends decided

32:40.626 --> 32:42.377
we should do a

32:40.626 --> 32:42.377
Hearth's Warming helper

32:42.419 --> 32:46.005
and give one pony a

32:42.419 --> 32:46.005
present to save time.

32:46.047 --> 32:48.007
[laughter]

32:48.049 --> 32:49.802
What?

32:49.843 --> 32:52.930
Let me guess. You got super

32:49.843 --> 32:52.930
worried about making sure

32:52.971 --> 32:56.015
the present was perfect
