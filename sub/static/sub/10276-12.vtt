So this is Hakalo.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.379
MIRANDA: I see why
they keep it hidden.

01:20.381 --> 01:21.780
Looks like paradise.

01:25.718 --> 01:27.753
They're here,
they're here!

01:27.755 --> 01:30.389
Welcome to
Hakalo!

01:30.391 --> 01:32.458
- Sofia!
- Lani!

01:37.897 --> 01:39.598
SOFIA: I missed you.

01:39.600 --> 01:43.569
Me, too. I'm really
happy you came.

01:43.571 --> 01:44.970
<i> Lee-no-a-ya.</i>

01:44.972 --> 01:46.772
Welcome to Hakalo.

01:46.774 --> 01:49.041
King Kamea, Queen Halia.

01:49.043 --> 01:50.776
Thank you for
inviting us.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.811
And we are honored
that you could join us

01:52.813 --> 01:54.446
for our Fire Pearl ceremony.

01:54.448 --> 01:57.649
Come. The festivities
have already begun.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.555
Greetings,
honored guests,

02:03.557 --> 02:06.825
and welcome to Hakalo's
Fire Pearl ceremony.

02:06.827 --> 02:08.293
Throughout our history,

02:08.295 --> 02:09.995
the young royals
of our kingdom

02:09.997 --> 02:13.432
have been asked to prove
they are wise and strong enough

02:13.434 --> 02:15.667
to join the circle
of leadership

02:15.669 --> 02:17.636
that rules our island.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.471
By climbing up
Mount Hakalo,

02:19.473 --> 02:21.673
and retrieving
the sacred Fire Pearl.

02:21.675 --> 02:24.676
And now, it is our beloved
daughter Leilani's turn

02:24.678 --> 02:26.411
to take
this difficult challenge,

02:26.413 --> 02:29.648
and prove she is ready
to join the circle.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.850
But that is
for tomorrow.

02:31.852 --> 02:33.852
Tonight, let us all
enjoy the feast,

02:33.854 --> 02:36.288
and the music
of Hakalo.

02:36.290 --> 02:38.824
( playing island music )

02:43.863 --> 02:45.264
Are you excited?

02:45.266 --> 02:47.599
Uh-huh, but
nervous, too.

02:47.601 --> 02:49.701
- Can I ask you
something?
- Sure.

02:49.703 --> 02:52.671
Come on. Come with me
up to the lanai.

02:55.975 --> 02:58.677
What is it?
Is everything okay?

02:58.679 --> 03:02.114
Yes. But I get to choose
one friend

03:02.116 --> 03:04.383
to help me get
the Fire Pearl tomorrow,

03:04.385 --> 03:05.551
to be my guide.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.152
My<i> ahkahuna.</i>

03:07.154 --> 03:09.521
And I'd like it
to be you.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.889
Why me?

03:10.891 --> 03:12.724
Because when we
first met,

03:12.726 --> 03:14.726
you believed in me
when nobody else did, Sofia.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.228
Will you do this
for me?

03:16.230 --> 03:17.863
Of course, Lani.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.665
I'd love to be
your<i> ahkahuna.</i>

03:19.667 --> 03:21.500
Thank you.

03:21.502 --> 03:22.968
Here's something special
I made for you to wear.

03:22.970 --> 03:25.037
It's your
<i> ahkahuna</i> bracelet.

03:25.039 --> 03:26.705
I love it.
Thank you.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.240
And you'll need
this map,

03:28.242 --> 03:30.375
since you'll be
guiding me and all.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.177
All right.
Let's see where
we're going.

03:32.179 --> 03:34.713
It looks like there are
a lot of different ways

03:34.715 --> 03:37.182
to reach the top
of Mount Hakalo,

03:37.184 --> 03:39.751
and none of them
look very easy.

03:39.753 --> 03:41.753
They're not, Sofia.

03:41.755 --> 03:44.890
We'll have to get past
dark jungles and
wild animals.

03:44.892 --> 03:47.492
Lani, can we
really do this?

03:47.494 --> 03:50.028
Well, there's something
that will help us.

03:50.030 --> 03:53.365
Something I haven't
told you about yet.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.567
- What is it?
- My powers.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.669
- What?
- Everyone in my family

03:57.671 --> 03:59.838
has the power to control
the weather.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.341
Watch this.

04:02.343 --> 04:05.844
I can create wind
to blow out these torches.

04:05.846 --> 04:09.581
That's what this ceremony
is really about.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.950
It's a test to see if
I can use my powers

04:11.952 --> 04:13.552
to get the Fire Pearl.

04:13.554 --> 04:15.120
They look
pretty amazing to me.

04:15.122 --> 04:16.755
They are.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.423
Oh, I'm so clumsy.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.125
( thunder crashes )

04:21.728 --> 04:23.362
( all gasping )

04:23.364 --> 04:25.097
Oh, no.

04:25.099 --> 04:26.632
It happened again.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.967
- Lani.
- Sofia.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.235
Was Lani just upset?

04:30.237 --> 04:32.871
Yes. How did you know?

04:32.873 --> 04:34.940
When Lani
loser her temper,

04:34.942 --> 04:36.642
she loses control
of her powers,

04:36.644 --> 04:38.977
which can whip up
terrible storms.

04:38.979 --> 04:41.246
To control her powers,
she must first learn

04:41.248 --> 04:42.948
to control her temper.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.950
That is the only way
she will succeed

04:44.952 --> 04:47.052
in the Fire Pearl quest.

04:47.054 --> 04:50.656
I promise I'll help her
in any way I can, King Kamea.

04:50.658 --> 04:54.826
Princess Sofia,
you are a good and true friend.

05:02.435 --> 05:06.138
Milo.
Milo!

05:07.907 --> 05:10.509
Here I am,
reporting for duty.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.444
Evil duty.

05:12.446 --> 05:14.179
Be quicker next time,

05:14.181 --> 05:17.115
or you'll wind up
a permanent decoration.

05:17.117 --> 05:20.619
So what are we doing
back here in Hakalo?

05:20.621 --> 05:24.022
King Kamea thinks
he's so high and mighty,

05:24.024 --> 05:27.259
banishing me for stealing
a few jewels.

05:27.261 --> 05:29.094
Actually, it was
a lot of jewels, ma'am.

05:29.096 --> 05:31.596
And don't forget,
you also tried to steal

05:31.598 --> 05:32.831
the emerald key.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.299
Be still and listen.

05:34.301 --> 05:36.435
I will take
my revenge

05:36.437 --> 05:39.805
by destroying
his kingdom.

05:39.807 --> 05:41.440
How are we gonna do it?

05:41.442 --> 05:44.643
We're going to make
Princess Lani's journey

05:44.645 --> 05:48.013
up Mount Hakalo
so difficult

05:48.015 --> 05:50.282
that she will
lose her temper

05:50.284 --> 05:53.385
and cause a storm
big enough to wash away

05:53.387 --> 05:55.587
this entire island!

06:00.293 --> 06:02.361
Princess Leilani,

06:02.363 --> 06:05.330
may this trail lead you
to the wisdom and strength

06:05.332 --> 06:07.966
needed to be
a great ruler.

06:12.338 --> 06:15.073
( blowing lilting melody )

06:16.876 --> 06:18.944
You can do this,
my daughter.

06:26.185 --> 06:29.221
Okay,<i> ahkahuna,</i>
which<i> way should we go?</i>

06:31.090 --> 06:33.992
This is an easy one.
Straight ahead.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.097
- Wow.
- ( gasps )

06:39.099 --> 06:40.665
What's that?

06:40.667 --> 06:43.235
Uh, the lava gates.

06:43.237 --> 06:45.337
This must be
my first challenge.

06:45.339 --> 06:47.539
( straining )

06:47.541 --> 06:49.107
These are really strong.

06:49.109 --> 06:50.942
I have to use
my powers.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.778
Maybe some wind
can blow them open.

06:58.885 --> 07:01.052
( frustrated groan )
They didn't even budge.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.921
It's okay, Lani.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.689
Why don't you try
using your powers

07:04.691 --> 07:06.425
on something that'll
knock the gates open?

07:06.427 --> 07:08.393
Like that boulder.

07:08.395 --> 07:10.829
Great idea,<i> ahkahuna.</i>

07:12.732 --> 07:14.499
Sofia, step back.

07:23.042 --> 07:25.310
That's one challenge down.

07:28.648 --> 07:31.016
Now which way
should we go?

07:32.618 --> 07:36.388
The trail on the right
is easier, but a lot longer.

07:36.390 --> 07:39.324
The one on the left
is shorter, but a lot steeper.

07:39.326 --> 07:42.093
I'll go whichever way
my<i> ahkahuna</i> says.

07:42.095 --> 07:44.095
I trust you, Sofia.

07:44.097 --> 07:46.398
Let's take
the shorter path.

07:46.400 --> 07:49.901
The sooner we get you
to the Fire Pearl, the better.

07:58.978 --> 08:03.448
Princess Lani passed
that first challenge too easily.

08:03.450 --> 08:07.686
I'll have to make sure
her next challenge
is impossible.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.754
Yes!
Uh, wait.

08:09.756 --> 08:12.190
I thought we were
trying to make her mad.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.125
We are.

08:14.127 --> 08:16.828
The harder the challenge,
the more mad she'll get.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.698
The more mad she gets,
the bigger the storm.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.299
That makes sense.

08:21.301 --> 08:23.502
And I just know I can
make that princess mad.

08:23.504 --> 08:25.504
Can I give it a try?

08:25.506 --> 08:28.940
Patience.
Your time will come.

08:40.853 --> 08:43.522
LANI: It's really
hard to walk.

08:43.524 --> 08:45.457
It should only be
a little ways longer

08:45.459 --> 08:47.025
before we get to the...

08:47.027 --> 08:48.627
- Ah, the map!
- What happened?

08:50.796 --> 08:52.197
It's blowing away.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.132
That's the only map
we have.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.901
You can't lose it.

08:57.169 --> 08:59.871
I know, Lani.
I won't.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.073
Okay, okay.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.308
Sorry.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.977
( breathes deeply )
Let's keep going.

09:11.150 --> 09:14.085
One, two, three, four, who can
chew through wood galore?

09:14.087 --> 09:15.887
Mamanu, Mamanu.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.089
Yay!

09:22.762 --> 09:24.162
( evil chuckle )

09:24.164 --> 09:27.065
Lani will never
get across now.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.568
She'll have one of
her temper storms,

09:29.570 --> 09:31.369
and then,
it's good-bye Hakalo.

09:31.371 --> 09:33.171
What can I do to help?

09:33.173 --> 09:36.007
Give me a mission, please.

09:36.009 --> 09:39.110
Your mission is to keep
out of my way.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.580
Ooh, they're coming.
We must hide.

09:42.715 --> 09:45.216
Come on, Lani.
Over here.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.919
According to the map,
there should be
a bridge here.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.788
I don't see
a bridge.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.556
Are you sure
you're reading
the map right?

09:51.558 --> 09:52.791
I'm sure.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.559
( laughs )

09:54.561 --> 09:56.461
Now go ahead, princess.

09:56.463 --> 09:58.196
Get good and mad.

09:58.198 --> 10:01.066
How are we gonna
get across now? Ugh!

10:01.068 --> 10:03.335
Come on.
There must be a way.

10:05.071 --> 10:07.072
Wait. That big totem pole
might be long enough

10:07.074 --> 10:08.473
to make a bridge.

10:08.475 --> 10:11.242
What if you used
your powers to get
it down here?

10:11.244 --> 10:12.944
Good idea, Sofia.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.379
What are<i> ahkahunas</i> for?

10:24.657 --> 10:25.790
Whoa!

10:25.792 --> 10:28.994
LANI: Timber!!

10:31.263 --> 10:33.164
Perfect.

10:33.166 --> 10:36.301
Oh, no, she made
a new bridge.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.169
I'll take care
of this.

10:54.353 --> 10:56.354
Look what it did.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.857
Now there's really
no way to get across.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.425
We shouldn't have
gone this way.

11:00.427 --> 11:03.094
Why did you make us
take this path, Sofia?

11:03.096 --> 11:04.696
I thought it was
the best way.

11:04.698 --> 11:06.498
Well, it wasn't.

11:06.500 --> 11:09.901
Now we're stuck here,
and I'll never get
the Fire Pearl.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.577
Lani, stay calm.

11:24.216 --> 11:25.784
That doesn't
look good.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.619
Maybe we should
go up there.

11:27.621 --> 11:29.354
Lani must do this
on her own.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.855
We cannot interfere.

11:35.394 --> 11:37.362
Lani, if you don't
calm down,

11:37.364 --> 11:39.130
you'll never get
the Fire Pearl.

11:39.132 --> 11:41.199
Don't you think
I know that, Sofia?

11:41.201 --> 11:42.834
Just take a deep breath.

11:42.836 --> 11:45.336
- That won't fix anything.
- Lani, listen.

11:45.338 --> 11:48.006
You know what always
calms me down?

11:48.008 --> 11:49.908
Thinking about
the things I love.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.142
Happy things.

11:51.144 --> 11:54.012
♪ Whenever I feel stormy ♪

11:54.014 --> 11:56.014
♪ And want to
yell and shout ♪

11:56.016 --> 11:58.917

I don't think it will
help me, Sofia.

12:49.469 --> 12:50.635
Can you try anyway?

13:36.982 --> 13:38.683
No!

13:38.685 --> 13:42.921
Where did this miserable
sunshine come from?

13:42.923 --> 13:44.689
I don't think
this totem pole's

13:44.691 --> 13:46.191
going to be big enough
to make a bridge.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.326
But we can use it
to sled down the hill,

13:48.328 --> 13:50.495
and right over the gorge.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.163
I guess that
could work.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.332
But you usually
need snow for sledding.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.100
Leave that to me.

14:05.044 --> 14:07.378
Incredible.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.613
Let's go before
it melts.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.281
Climb on.

14:16.555 --> 14:18.089
- Yes!
- No.

14:19.625 --> 14:22.627
I'll have to find
another way

14:22.629 --> 14:25.363
to trick her into
starting a storm

14:25.365 --> 14:27.632
that will destroy
this island.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.567
Oh, oh, please,
let me do it.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.336
I'm the right snake
for the job.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.004
All right then.

14:33.006 --> 14:36.241
But I'll need to make you
a little scarier.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.476
Yippee! A mission!
Finally.

14:42.815 --> 14:46.050
Look. We're almost
at the top.

14:46.052 --> 14:48.219
Nothing's going to
stop us now.

14:50.422 --> 14:53.024
Are you ready to chase them
down the mountain?

14:53.026 --> 14:54.592
- Ready.
- Willing.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.594
And evil.

14:59.498 --> 15:01.099
See? That wasn't so bad.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.901
And according
to the map,

15:02.903 --> 15:05.670
it should be an easy hike
from now on,

15:05.672 --> 15:08.172
- ( hissing )
- ( screaming )

15:10.676 --> 15:12.343
Get the map, troops.

15:12.345 --> 15:13.778
If we get the map...

15:13.780 --> 15:15.513
They'll never find
the Fire Pearl.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.515
She'll be so mad.

15:17.517 --> 15:19.450
I won't let you
take the map.

15:19.452 --> 15:22.120
- Sofia!
- Run!

15:25.624 --> 15:26.691
( gasps )

15:28.060 --> 15:30.261
The map!

15:30.263 --> 15:31.863
- Got it!
- Victory!

15:31.865 --> 15:33.531
Evil victory.

15:33.533 --> 15:36.200
I told you to be
careful with the map.

15:36.202 --> 15:39.470
Lani, the wind you made
blew it out of my hand.

15:39.472 --> 15:42.974
Because you led us
right to a giant
three-headed snake.

15:42.976 --> 15:44.542
Not on purpose.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.444
I never should have asked you
to be my<i> ahkahuna.</i>

15:46.446 --> 15:49.447
If that's how you feel,
I won't be your<i> ahkahuna.</i>

15:49.449 --> 15:52.083
You can find
the Fire Pearl yourself.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.818
Fine. I will.

15:53.820 --> 15:55.653
I don't need the map
or an<i> ahkahuna.</i>

15:55.655 --> 15:57.522
I can do this by myself.

16:02.828 --> 16:05.964
Oh, no. Which way
am I supposed to go?

16:05.966 --> 16:08.166
I'll just try
this path.

16:13.072 --> 16:14.505
Wait.

16:14.507 --> 16:17.342
( frustrated groan )
I'm going in circles.

16:17.344 --> 16:19.744
I can't do this
by myself.

16:20.746 --> 16:22.580
What have I done?

16:22.582 --> 16:25.583
Sofia! Wait!

16:25.585 --> 16:27.919
Sofia.

16:27.921 --> 16:29.520
I know none of this
is your fault.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.789
I was frustrated
and angry,

16:31.791 --> 16:35.293
and I took it all out
on you. I'm sorry.

16:35.295 --> 16:38.329
You really need to learn
to control your temper, Lani.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.465
I know, I know.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.500
It's the only way
I'll join the circle
of leadership.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.702
It's not just about
being a good leader.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.838
It's about being
a good person,

16:46.840 --> 16:48.272
and a good friend.

16:48.274 --> 16:50.108
You're right.

16:50.110 --> 16:52.643
I just can't help
myself, Sofia.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.946
I ruin everything.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.182
You can still do this.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.684
How?

16:59.686 --> 17:01.185
By listening to
your<i> ahkahuna.</i>

17:01.187 --> 17:03.187
You'll be
my<i> ahkahuna</i> again?

17:03.189 --> 17:04.655
If that's
what you want.

17:04.657 --> 17:06.858
More than anything.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.626
Here. You'll need this.

17:10.396 --> 17:13.631
Okay. First, we need
to get the map back.

17:18.737 --> 17:21.706
Hurry, boys. Time to
report back to base camp.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.741
Yeah, but where is
base camp?

17:23.743 --> 17:25.143
The map.

17:25.145 --> 17:27.645
We need to get him
to open his mouth.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.113
I know what to do.

17:37.589 --> 17:39.657
- What is that?
- Ow!

17:39.659 --> 17:41.526
It's hail.

17:41.528 --> 17:43.161
- Ow!
- Ooh!

17:45.831 --> 17:46.931
The map!

17:46.933 --> 17:48.666
Great job, Lani.

17:48.668 --> 17:49.834
We're almost there.

17:49.836 --> 17:52.270
The maps says
take the center stairs.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.574
You let them
get away!

17:56.576 --> 17:58.943
We tried
to complete the mission.

17:58.945 --> 18:00.678
But she made it hail.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.346
You failed me,

18:02.348 --> 18:05.783
just like all the useless
snakes that came before you.

18:10.923 --> 18:14.692
All right, I'll take care
of those princesses myself.

18:24.470 --> 18:26.704
This is it.
We're here.

18:40.219 --> 18:42.420
It's so weird to think
my parents came here

18:42.422 --> 18:44.655
when they were my age,
and my grandparents.

18:44.657 --> 18:47.391
And now
it's your turn.

18:50.095 --> 18:51.596
Huh?

18:51.598 --> 18:53.831
The fire pearl,
it's missing.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.766
Not exactly.

18:55.768 --> 18:58.503
Mamanu.
What are you doing here?

18:58.505 --> 19:01.005
My father banished you
from Hakalo forever.

19:01.007 --> 19:02.907
Give Lani back
the Fire Pearl.

19:02.909 --> 19:04.509
Why?

19:04.511 --> 19:06.410
Does me having
the Fire Pearl

19:06.412 --> 19:07.745
make you angry?

19:07.747 --> 19:10.815
Does it make you
furious?

19:12.151 --> 19:15.286
- ( gasps )
- Just give it to me!

19:15.288 --> 19:18.956
You'll never get the Fire Pearl
from me, princess,

19:18.958 --> 19:21.692
and that means
you failed your quest,

19:21.694 --> 19:26.130
you failed your parents, and you
failed your whole kingdom!

19:26.132 --> 19:27.932
Don't listen
to her, Lani.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.567
She's trying to make you
lose your temper.

19:30.869 --> 19:32.336
Another storm.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.705
Lani will come down.
I know she will.

19:34.707 --> 19:38.342
( laughing )

19:40.679 --> 19:42.880
You have to
calm down, Lani.

19:42.882 --> 19:44.815
I can't do it, Sofia.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.350
I can't control
my powers.

19:46.352 --> 19:47.552
You have to.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.787
Your storm is
flooding the island.

19:49.789 --> 19:53.157
Okay. Sunny thoughts.

19:53.159 --> 19:57.695
♪ Climbing a palm tree
as high as the moon ♪

19:57.697 --> 19:59.230

19:59.232 --> 20:04.335

20:04.337 --> 20:06.671

seashells for domes ♪

20:12.045 --> 20:19.750

20:19.752 --> 20:21.819
The storm is going away.

20:23.755 --> 20:27.058
See that? You can
control your powers.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.859
It doesn't matter.

20:28.861 --> 20:30.895
You're going to fail
your test

20:30.897 --> 20:33.831
because you're never
getting the Fire Pearl.

20:33.833 --> 20:36.767
- No!
- Yes, I am, Mamanu.

20:56.888 --> 20:59.957
Wow! You can control
volcanos too?

20:59.959 --> 21:01.359
I guess I can.

21:01.361 --> 21:04.095
Don't act so pleased
with yourself, princess.

21:04.097 --> 21:06.831
Your powers
are no match for mine.

21:10.802 --> 21:11.969
Look out!

21:11.971 --> 21:14.038
Leave my island alone!

21:19.978 --> 21:23.180
No!!

21:25.250 --> 21:27.451
Wow, Lani.

21:27.453 --> 21:29.820
You really controlled
your powers.

21:29.822 --> 21:31.822
I controlled
my temper.

21:31.824 --> 21:33.824
That was
the real test.

21:33.826 --> 21:35.860
And I think
I passed it.

21:37.596 --> 21:40.298
( panting )
How humiliating.

21:44.736 --> 21:45.970
She did it!

21:45.972 --> 21:47.605
( gasping )

21:47.607 --> 21:50.741
My noble daughter,
you have proven this day

21:50.743 --> 21:53.244
that you are ready
to take your place

21:53.246 --> 21:56.447
in the circle
of leadership.

21:56.449 --> 21:59.016
Do you promise to always
protect your people,

21:59.018 --> 22:00.818
and your island?

22:02.120 --> 22:04.288
I promise.

22:04.290 --> 22:05.856
<i> Kanaha!</i>

22:05.858 --> 22:07.958
All hail the princess!

22:07.960 --> 22:09.960
ALL:<i> Kanaha!</i>

22:09.962 --> 22:12.163
<i> Kanaha!</i>

22:13.832 --> 22:16.667
Lani, I am
so proud of you.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.169
Thank you, Father.

22:22.941 --> 22:24.308
Congratulations, Lani.

22:24.310 --> 22:27.378
I couldn't have done it
without my<i> ahkahuna.</i>
