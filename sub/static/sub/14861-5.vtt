WEBVTT

00:02.033 --> 00:04.705
DUDE,
I DON'T WANNA SCARE YOU,

00:04.705 --> 00:07.638
BUT YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING DARK
AND MISSHAPEN ON YOUR NECK.

00:07.638 --> 00:12.113
OH, THAT IS TOTALLY CANCER,
AND NOT THE GOOD KIND.

00:12.113 --> 00:14.645
(strained voice)
OH, MY GOD. I'M GONNA DIE!

00:14.645 --> 00:16.317
GLAD YOU DIDN'T WANNA
SCARE HIM, CRAIG.

00:16.317 --> 00:18.419
LOOK AT IT. IT LOOKS LIKE
A CHOCOLATE CHIP.

00:18.419 --> 00:19.520
(cries)

00:19.520 --> 00:22.053
YEAH.
THAT IS A CHOCOLATE CHIP.

00:22.053 --> 00:23.794
OHH. OH, THANK GOD.

00:23.794 --> 00:25.356
(espresso machine hissing)

00:25.356 --> 00:28.199
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN GET ANY
BAD NEWS ABOUT A CHOCOLATE CHIP.

00:28.199 --> 00:31.362
HOW ABOUT THIS?
THERE'S A GIANT CHOCOLATE CHIP

00:31.362 --> 00:33.204
HEADED STRAIGHT TOWARD EARTH.

00:33.204 --> 00:35.536
I'M STILL HAPPY BECAUSE WHEN
IT BREAKS UP IN THE ATMOSPHERE,

00:35.536 --> 00:38.038
IT'S GONNA BECOME
WARM CHOCOLATE RAIN,

00:38.038 --> 00:39.310
AND I'LL BE SITTING
ON MY FRONT PORCH

00:39.310 --> 00:41.112
WITH A BIG BOWL
OF COOKIE BATTER

00:41.112 --> 00:43.074
WAITING FOR
THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE!

00:43.074 --> 00:45.716
YOU GUYS ARE IDIOTS.

00:45.716 --> 00:48.219
YOU GUYS ARE IDIOTS.
YEAH.

00:48.219 --> 00:49.420
WHO, ME AND HER?

00:49.420 --> 00:51.322
YEAH, YOU AND HER,
YOU'RE BOTH IDIOTS.

00:52.423 --> 00:54.085
SORRY, MA'AM.

00:57.088 --> 00:58.459
WHERE'S LUCY?

00:58.459 --> 01:01.362
STILL SLEEPING. SHE HAD ONE
OF HER NIGHTMARES LAST NIGHT.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.664
REALLY?
WHY DIDN'T YOU WAKE ME?

01:03.664 --> 01:06.337
I COULDN'T FIND MY BUCKET
OF WATER OR MY BULLHORN.

01:07.438 --> 01:11.071
MOMMY? MOMMY?
MOM? THERESA?

01:11.071 --> 01:12.373
MRS. KEEN?

01:12.373 --> 01:16.147
(sighs) RIDICULOUS.

01:16.147 --> 01:17.308
DADDY?

01:17.308 --> 01:18.609
(sputters) YEAH?

01:18.609 --> 01:20.311
I'M SORRY, HONEY.

01:20.311 --> 01:21.552
YOU LIVE WITH A BAND
IN COLLEGE,

01:21.552 --> 01:23.114
YOU LEARN TO SLEEP
THROUGH ANYTHING.

01:23.114 --> 01:24.455
OH, I CAN'T HEAR ENOUGH

01:24.455 --> 01:27.158
OF THOSE FUN
"LIVING WITH A BAND" STORIES.

01:27.158 --> 01:29.820
SHE LEARNED TO PLAY EVERY
INSTRUMENT, AND I MEANEVERY--

01:29.820 --> 01:32.723
I GET IT.
HEY. IS MY NEW PHONE HERE?

01:32.723 --> 01:35.526
I WANT TO PUT IT IN THE HOLSTER
I FASHIONED WITH MY LEATHER KIT.

01:35.526 --> 01:36.867
HERE YOU GO.

01:36.867 --> 01:39.670
ANDI HAD THEM INSTALL
THIS COOL NEW TRACKING APP

01:39.670 --> 01:41.432
THAT'LL ALWAYS
LET US KNOW WHERE YOU ARE.

01:41.432 --> 01:43.534
SO NO STRIP CLUBS, MISTER.

01:43.534 --> 01:46.777
EW. STRIP CLUBS? GROSS.
I'M GONNA GO WATCH THIS CHARGE.

01:46.777 --> 01:49.240
I WISH GRANT HAD A SMARTPHONE.

01:49.240 --> 01:50.841
I LOVE THE GUY, BUT HE THINKS

01:50.841 --> 01:53.244
TECHNOLOGY DISTRACTS PEOPLE
FROM LIVING IN THE MOMENT,

01:53.244 --> 01:55.186
WHICH I THOUGHT WAS THE POINT.

01:55.186 --> 01:58.219
SO WHAT'S UP WITH ME? NOT MUCH.

01:58.219 --> 02:01.222
JUST DROPPED OFF JANE,
THE AWESOME NEW LADY I'M DATING.

02:01.222 --> 02:02.623
IT'S TRUE--

02:02.623 --> 02:05.526
YOU GOT TO KISS A FEW FROGS
BEFORE YOU FIND A PRINCESS,

02:05.526 --> 02:07.198
OR ONE FROG FOR TEN YEARS

02:07.198 --> 02:09.800
UNTIL YOU WANT TO HANG YOURSELF
WITH A SWAMP REED.

02:09.800 --> 02:10.901
WHATEVER WEIRD THING
YOU NEED TO DO

02:10.901 --> 02:12.703
TO GET YOUR BODY
TO PERFORM LIKE A MAN.

02:12.703 --> 02:15.135
JANE'S PARENTS
OWN A COFFEEHOUSE.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.667
SHE SAID I COULD
PLAY A GIG THERE.

02:16.667 --> 02:19.240
I MADE UP SOME FLYERS
TO PAPER THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

02:19.240 --> 02:23.244
NATHAN, I'M BORROWING YOUR BIKE!
COME HELP ME MOVE THE SEAT!

02:23.244 --> 02:25.346
SO THAT'S GREAT
IT'S WORKING OUT WITH JANE.

02:25.346 --> 02:27.348
YEAH, SHE WANTS ME
TO MEET HER PARENTS.

02:27.348 --> 02:28.879
WELL, THAT'S THE END OF THAT.

02:28.879 --> 02:30.281
OH, KENNY'S NOT BAD
WITH PARENTS.

02:30.281 --> 02:32.623
HE'S JUST BAD WITH MOMS.
REALLY BAD.

02:32.623 --> 02:34.585
LIKE, WRITTEN APOLOGY BAD.

02:34.585 --> 02:37.328
LIKE, WRAPPED IN AN AREA RUG
AND DRAGGED INTO THE FOREST BAD.

02:37.328 --> 02:39.860
YEAH, I'M GOOD WITH DADS.
THEY'RE ALL...

02:39.860 --> 02:42.863
(low-pitched voice) "YEAH,"
"SPORTS," "THINGS ON THE GRILL."

02:42.863 --> 02:45.596
(whispers) MOMS...
(normal voice) THEY LIKE TO PRY,

02:45.596 --> 02:47.798
GET UNDER YOUR HOOD,
TINKER AROUND.

02:47.798 --> 02:50.201
I GOT STUFF UNDER THERE
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT.

02:50.201 --> 02:52.303
YEAH, LIKE THE TIME
YOU GAVE THAT GUY 200 BUCKS

02:52.303 --> 02:54.475
FOR NUNCHAKU LESSONS,
AND WHEN YOU GOT TO HIS HOUSE,

02:54.475 --> 02:56.347
ALL HE WANTED TO DO
WAS BRUSH YOUR HAIR?

02:56.347 --> 02:58.709
YEAH, SENSEI JERRY WAS WEIRD.

03:01.312 --> 03:03.914
WOW. THERE ARE A LOT
OF HOT GIRLS IN HERE.
(mouths word)

03:03.914 --> 03:06.757
WHICH ONE WILL I CHOOSE
TO BE MY LOVER?

03:06.757 --> 03:10.321
I'M SO NERVOUS ABOUT MEETING
JANE'S MOM. WHAT AM I GONNA SAY?

03:10.321 --> 03:13.193
START WITH A QUESTION ABOUT
HER DAUGHTER. MOMS LOVE THAT.

03:13.193 --> 03:16.697
(strumming)
OKAY. HOW ABOUT...
"DID JANE POP RIGHT OUT OF YOU,

03:16.697 --> 03:20.200
OR WAS IT A STRUGGLE,
LIKE TRYING TO BATHE A CAT?"

03:20.200 --> 03:22.303
IS THAT WEIRD?
THAT'S WEIRD, RIGHT?

03:22.303 --> 03:23.504
HI, GUYS.

03:23.504 --> 03:26.407
HI.
SO, KENNY, ARE YOU READY
TO MEET MY PARENTS?

03:26.407 --> 03:29.380
WAIT A MINUTE.
ARE BOTH YOUR PARENTS WOMEN,

03:29.380 --> 03:31.382
OR IS YOUR DAD, LIKE,
FRENCH OR SOMETHING?

03:31.382 --> 03:33.644
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU KNOW
THAT MY PARENTS ARE LESBIANS.

03:33.644 --> 03:36.347
I KEEP SAYING I'M EXCITED
FOR YOU TO MEET MY MOMS?

03:36.347 --> 03:39.290
OH.I THOUGHT YOU WERE DOING,
LIKE, AN URBAN THING.

03:39.290 --> 03:42.253
YOU KNOW...
"DON'T TALK ABOUT MY MOMS."

03:42.253 --> 03:44.395
THAT'S WHY I KEPT SAYING,
"WORD."

03:44.395 --> 03:46.357
YOU DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THIS, DO YOU?

03:46.357 --> 03:50.301
TWO MOMS. (laughs)
DOUBLE THE MOMS!

03:50.301 --> 03:51.302
(laughs)

03:51.302 --> 03:53.934
ROCK ON! (laughs) YAY.

03:55.766 --> 03:57.738
(resumes strumming)
HI. I'M RENEE,
THE MANAGER HERE.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.370
OH, HI. I'M CRAIG.

03:59.370 --> 04:00.711
SO DO YOU HAVE
EVERYTHING YOU NEED?

04:00.711 --> 04:02.012
A RISER, A MICROPHONE,

04:02.012 --> 04:03.374
AND A ROOM FULL
OF BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.

04:03.374 --> 04:04.715
(both laugh)

04:04.715 --> 04:05.876
IS IT LADIES' NIGHT?

04:05.876 --> 04:07.518
UH, IT'S ALWAYS LADIES' NIGHT
AROUND HERE,

04:07.518 --> 04:08.919
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
(chuckles)

04:08.919 --> 04:10.851
HEH HEH!

04:10.851 --> 04:12.683
I'M SORRY.
IDON'TKNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

04:12.683 --> 04:14.725
IT'S A LESBIAN COFFEEHOUSE,

04:14.725 --> 04:16.687
AND WE'VE NEVER HAD
A MALE PERFORMER HERE,

04:16.687 --> 04:20.361
SO THIS SHOULD BE INTERESTING.
GOOD LUCK.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.392
THANKS.

04:21.392 --> 04:23.634
"WHICH ONE OF US
DID JANE COME OUT OF?"

04:23.634 --> 04:25.566
THAT'S AN INTERESTING
FIRST QUESTION.

04:25.566 --> 04:28.268
(chuckles) YEAH, I'M SORRY.
CAN I START OVER?

04:28.268 --> 04:29.670
THAT WOULD MEAN
WE BOTH HAVE TO KEEP HOLDING

04:29.670 --> 04:32.543
THESE POLITE SMILES,
BUT SURE, GO AHEAD.

04:32.543 --> 04:35.946
SO HOW LONG HAVE YOU
OWNED THIS COFFEEHOUSE?

04:35.946 --> 04:37.678
THAT'S MUCH BETTER.

04:38.909 --> 04:40.280
IT'S BEEN ABOUT A YEAR.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.352
AND DID THE LESBIANS
COME WITH THIS PLACE,

04:41.352 --> 04:43.854
OR DO YOU HAVE TO
LURE THEM IN SOMEHOW?

04:43.854 --> 04:45.516
AND HE'S OFF AGAIN.

04:45.516 --> 04:47.388
I'M SORRY.
I GET NERVOUS AROUND MOMS,

04:47.388 --> 04:49.620
THE WAY THEY DIG INTO YOUR BRAIN
AND THEY NEVER STOP UNTIL

04:49.620 --> 04:53.023
THEY FIGURE OUT ALL THE WEIRD
STUFF NO ONE SHOULD EVER KNOW.

04:53.023 --> 04:56.327
BUT I'M SURE THAT, UM,
YOU GUYS AREN'T LIKE THAT.

04:56.327 --> 04:59.730
SO WHAT DID YOU DO
BEFORE YOU OWNED THIS PLACE?

04:59.730 --> 05:01.432
WE'RE BOTH THERAPISTS.

05:01.432 --> 05:03.674
SUCK IT.

05:03.674 --> 05:05.976
(indistinct conversations)

05:05.976 --> 05:07.938
(amplified voice)
HELLO, LESBIANS.

05:07.938 --> 05:09.340
(conversations stop)

05:09.340 --> 05:11.412
UH, MY NAME IS CRAIG GRIFFITH,

05:11.412 --> 05:14.885
AND, UH, THIS SONG

05:53.353 --> 05:55.656
OH, JUST ENJOYING
THIS BEAUTIFUL MORNING.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.988
CHECK OUT THIS TREE.
IT'S FULL OF SURPRISES.

05:57.988 --> 06:01.392
NAH, IT NEVER IS.
HEY. I GOT YOU A PRESENT.

06:01.392 --> 06:05.896
IT IS A BRAND... NEW...
SMARTPHONE.

06:05.896 --> 06:07.438
THANKS,

06:07.438 --> 06:09.870
BUT MY CURRENT PHONE
SUITS ME FINE.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.703
BUT, GRANT, LOOK AT
ALL THESE THINGS IT CAN DO.

06:12.703 --> 06:16.106
HERE YOU HAVE YOUR MAPS.
HERE YOU CAN FIND ANY BUSINESS.

06:16.106 --> 06:17.608
HMM.
PRESS THIS,

06:17.608 --> 06:20.911
AND YOU HEAR
A SAD TROMBONE SOUND.
(wah-wah horn plays)

06:20.911 --> 06:22.382
(laughs)

06:22.382 --> 06:25.085
THIS IS VERY KIND OF YOU,
BUT I DON'T NEED THESE THINGS.

06:25.085 --> 06:28.519
I HAVE MY LAMINATED ROAD ATLAS,
A COPY OF THE YELLOW PAGES,

06:28.519 --> 06:30.090
AND A BEAUTIFUL
SET OF ENCYCLOPEDIAS.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.091
MM.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.563
AND AS YOU KNOW...

06:32.563 --> 06:34.495
I PLAY A REAL TROMBONE.

06:34.495 --> 06:35.966
MMM.

06:35.966 --> 06:37.798
OOH, LOOK.

06:37.798 --> 06:40.701
HERE'S SOMETHING YOU DON'T
HAVE A LAME, OLD VERSION OF.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.603
IT'S A GAME
CALLED "ANGRY BIRDS."

06:42.603 --> 06:44.575
SEE? YOU THROW THESE BIRDS
AT THOSE PIGS.

06:44.575 --> 06:46.807
I DON'T BELIEVE IN THROWING
ANIMALS AT ONE ANOTHER.

06:46.807 --> 06:49.039
BUT THE PIGS HAVE STOLEN
THE BIRDS' EGGS.

06:50.110 --> 06:51.482
WELL, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

06:55.185 --> 06:58.418
I KILLED LAST NIGHT
AT THAT COFFEEHOUSE.

06:58.418 --> 07:01.752
ONCE I FOUND MY LESBIAN GROOVE,
I WAS UNSTOPPABLE.

07:01.752 --> 07:03.153
IN FACT,
I WROTE A SONG CALLED

07:03.153 --> 07:06.156
"MY LESBIAN GROOVE
IS UNSTOPPABLE."

07:06.156 --> 07:07.928
HEY, GUYS.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.701
REMEMBER HOW WE USED TO HAVE
CONVERSATIONS? THAT WAS FUN.

07:10.701 --> 07:13.133
OH, SORRY. I GOT
THIS TRACKING APP FOR NATHAN.

07:13.133 --> 07:15.606
IT'S GREAT.
I CAN FOLLOW HIS EVERY MOVE.

07:15.606 --> 07:17.868
OH, NO--DON'T DO IT, MAN.

07:17.868 --> 07:19.910
NO, NOT BACK TO THE MODEL TRAIN
STORE. (clicks teeth) UGH.

07:19.910 --> 07:21.942
STUPID PIG.

07:21.942 --> 07:25.576
EASY. HE'S ONLY 13.
HE'S STILL FINDING HIS WAY.

07:25.576 --> 07:27.648
NO. THIS--
THIS "ANGRY BIRDS" GAME.

07:27.648 --> 07:31.782
THESE PIGS--
THEIR BEHAVIOR'S UNTENABLE.

07:31.782 --> 07:34.685
HELLO, TROLLS...
MYSELF INCLUDED.

07:34.685 --> 07:36.827
OH, HEY, SO CRAIG TELLS US

07:36.827 --> 07:39.560
YOU FOUND YOURSELF
IN A DOUBLE-MOM SITUATION?

07:39.560 --> 07:42.062
NOT JUST TWO MOMS--
TWO THERAPIST MOMS.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.595
THAT SOUNDS MORE TERRIFYING
THAN YOUR WORST FEAR--

07:44.595 --> 07:47.668
A BADGER
WITH THE FACE OF A MAN.

07:47.668 --> 07:50.641
OOH. CAN WE PLEASE
NOT TALK ABOUTMADGERS?

07:50.641 --> 07:52.002
(gravelly voice) KENNY...

07:52.002 --> 07:53.003
STOP IT.

07:53.003 --> 07:54.474
(normal voice) SORRY.

07:54.474 --> 07:58.008
ACTUALLY, THINGS ENDED UP GOING
SURPRISINGLY WELL WITH THE MOMS.

07:58.008 --> 07:59.179
AND THEN WHEN I WAS 8,

07:59.179 --> 08:01.481
MY MOM ACCIDENTALLY
FORGOT ME AT THE MALL.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.814
AND THAT WAS AFTER
SHE "ACCIDENTALLY" FORGOT YOU

08:03.814 --> 08:06.587
AT THE DRY CLEANERS, THE GROCERY
STORE, AND THE AMUSEMENT PARK?

08:06.587 --> 08:07.918
AND THE BEACH,
THE COUNTY DUMP,

08:07.918 --> 08:09.760
AND JUST OVER
THE CANADIAN BORDER?

08:09.760 --> 08:11.491
(whispers) YES.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.593
WERE YOU EVER HONEST
WITH YOUR MOTHER

08:12.593 --> 08:13.794
ABOUT HOW THAT
MADE YOU FEEL?

08:13.794 --> 08:16.226
NO,
BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE HONEST,

08:16.226 --> 08:18.869
THEN PEOPLE STOP LOVING YOU,
RIGHT?

08:18.869 --> 08:20.731
THERE IT IS.

08:24.074 --> 08:25.776
I REALLY OPENED UP.

08:25.776 --> 08:28.108
CALLED MY MOM THIS MORNING,
TOLD HER HOW I FELT,

08:28.108 --> 08:29.540
GOTTHATMONKEY OFF MY BACK.

08:29.540 --> 08:32.142
ALTHOUGH,
THANKS TO LINDA AND CARROLL,

08:32.142 --> 08:35.686
I REALIZED MY BACK IS COMPLETELY
COVERED IN MONKEYS.

08:35.686 --> 08:37.618
(cell phone rings, beep)

08:37.618 --> 08:38.619
HEY, HONEY. WHAT'S UP?

08:38.619 --> 08:39.620
Hi!

08:39.620 --> 08:41.051
HOW'S LUNCH AT SCARDINO'S?

08:41.051 --> 08:45.155
UH, H-HOW DO YOU KNOW
WHERE I AM? ARE YOU HERE?

08:45.155 --> 08:48.729
NO, I HAD THAT TRACKING APP
INSTALLED ON ALL OUR PHONES.

08:48.729 --> 08:51.602
SO... YOU'LL ALWAYS KNOW
HOW TO FIND ME?

08:51.602 --> 08:53.604
YEAH, HOW FUN IS THAT?

08:53.604 --> 08:55.836
AND I SEE THAT YOU'RE RIGHT
ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE MALL.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.938
CAN YOU RUN A COUPLE
QUICK ERRANDS FOR ME?

08:57.938 --> 08:58.939
UM...

08:58.939 --> 09:00.540
Great. I'll text you a list.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.872
THANKS, HONEY.

09:01.872 --> 09:02.873
BUT... (sighs)

09:02.873 --> 09:04.114
(beep)

09:04.114 --> 09:05.576
OH, GOD.
(sets down cell phone)

09:05.576 --> 09:07.217
THERESA'S GONNA KNOW
MY EVERY MOVE.

09:07.217 --> 09:08.679
THAT PIG'S GOTTA DIE.

09:10.651 --> 09:11.652
OH.

09:11.652 --> 09:12.653
THE GAME.

09:12.653 --> 09:13.684
RIGHT.

09:18.028 --> 09:19.830
I DON'T KNOW, GUYS.

09:19.830 --> 09:21.592
SEEING YOU ON THE FLOOR
LIKE THIS,

09:21.592 --> 09:23.133
GETTING READY TO SUFFOCATE ME,

09:23.133 --> 09:25.996
I GOTTA BE HONEST,
I'M HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS.

09:25.996 --> 09:27.698
WE'RE NOT GOING
TO SUFFOCATE YOU.

09:27.698 --> 09:28.969
IT'LLFEELLIKE
WE'RE SUFFOCATING YOU.

09:28.969 --> 09:30.671
AND IF SOMETHING WENT WRONG,

09:30.671 --> 09:32.102
THEN THE CORONER'S REPORT
WOULDSAYWE SUFFOCATED YOU.

09:32.102 --> 09:34.945
BUT WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING
IS REBIRTHING YOU,

09:34.945 --> 09:36.947
BECAUSE OFTEN,
PEOPLE WITH MULTIPLE ISSUES

09:36.947 --> 09:38.949
CAN BE HELPED BY REVISITING
THEIR FIRST TRAUMA...

09:38.949 --> 09:41.011
WHICH IS BIRTH...

09:41.011 --> 09:43.684
OR FIGHTING OFF TWO LESBIANS
WHO ARE TRYING TO SUFFOCATE YOU.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.155
JUST KIDDING.

09:45.155 --> 09:49.219
WHAT THE HECK? DIAL ME UP
TO 10 CENTIMETERS, LADIES.

09:49.219 --> 09:51.091
I'M IN!

09:52.162 --> 09:53.794
PUSH, KENNY.

09:53.794 --> 09:56.366
PUSH YOUR WAY INTO THE WORLD.
START YOUR LIFE ANEW.

09:56.366 --> 10:00.100
FIGHT, KENNY!
FIGHT TO BE BORN!

10:00.100 --> 10:02.973
(pants)

10:02.973 --> 10:06.176
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, KENNY!

10:06.176 --> 10:08.979
I HAVE A LITTLE VACATION TIME
SAVED UP,

10:08.979 --> 10:12.282
SO I FOUND THIS AMAZING VILLA
IN COZUMEL, AND I THOUGHT

10:12.282 --> 10:15.015
MAYBE THE TWO OF US COULD HAVE
A ROMANTIC WEEKEND SOMETIME.

10:15.015 --> 10:17.187
COZUMEL. MM-HMM.

10:19.189 --> 10:20.821
YOU'RE PLAYING THE GAME NOW,
AREN'T YOU?

10:20.821 --> 10:22.853
I CAN'T STOP.
IT'S NO LONGER CLEAR

10:22.853 --> 10:26.026
WHETHER I'M PLAYING THE GAME
OR THE GAME'S PLAYING ME.

10:29.700 --> 10:31.702
(amplified voice) THIS ONE'S FOR
ALL MY STRONG SISTERS OUT THERE.

I JUST WISH I DIDN'T
HAVE TO SING INTO SOMETHING

11:27.818 --> 11:30.120
SHAPED LIKE THIS SYMBOL
OF MALE DOMINANCE.

11:30.120 --> 11:32.692
(chuckles) YOU KNOW,
IF I WERE STILL SLEEPING

11:32.692 --> 11:35.996
WITH MEN INSTEAD OF WOMEN,
I WOULD BE ALL OVER YOU.

11:37.768 --> 11:40.300
RENEE SAID
SHE'D BE ALL OVER ME.

11:40.300 --> 11:43.103
I THINK I HAVE A SHOT,
AND WHY WOULDN'T I?

11:43.103 --> 11:46.777
I AM A LESBIAN FOLK HERO. I FILL
WOMEN'S GAY HEARTS WITH SONG.

11:46.777 --> 11:49.209
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU,
AND IN ALL HONESTY,

11:49.209 --> 11:51.742
I'M ALSO SURPRISED, BECAUSE OF
YOUR MODEST LEVEL OF TALENT,

11:51.742 --> 11:53.183
AND IN FURTHER HONESTY,

11:53.183 --> 11:56.086
I'M WEARING YOUR SOCKS AND HAVE
NO PLANS TO RETURN THEM.

11:56.086 --> 11:59.189
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, MAN?
I'VE HAD A BREAKTHROUGH.

11:59.189 --> 12:01.922
I'M STARTING WITH A CLEAN SLATE
NOW, AND ACCORDING TO THE MOMS,

12:01.922 --> 12:04.294
I HAVE TO BE TOTALLY HONEST
WITH MYSELF AND THOSE AROUND ME,

12:04.294 --> 12:05.225
MY OVERPAID FRIEND.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.226
I EARN MY MONEY.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.297
EH.

12:07.297 --> 12:09.359
OKAY, LISTEN, I GOT A PROBLEM.

12:09.359 --> 12:11.101
I NEED ONE OF YOU
TO TAKE MY PHONE LATER TODAY,

12:11.101 --> 12:13.233
AND IF THERESA CALLS,
PRETEND TO BE ME

12:13.233 --> 12:14.965
AND TEXT HER BACK
THAT I'M STUCK IN A MEETING.

12:14.965 --> 12:16.867
THAT'S NOT HONEST, SO I'M OUT.

12:16.867 --> 12:18.138
AND I WILL NOT HELP A MAN

12:18.138 --> 12:20.270
PUT ONE OVER ON HIS SISTER
LIKE THAT.

12:20.270 --> 12:21.411
COME ON, GUYS.

12:21.411 --> 12:23.914
THERESA'S TRACKING MY EVERY MOVE
WITH THIS NEW PHONE APP.

12:23.914 --> 12:25.115
WHAT DO YOU CARE?
YOU HAVE NO LIFE.

12:25.115 --> 12:27.117
I HAVE A LIFE.
EH.

12:27.117 --> 12:31.321
OKAY. THERE'S SOMEPLACE I GO
EVERY DAY FOR HALF AN HOUR

12:31.321 --> 12:32.382
ON MY WAY HOME FROM WORK,

12:32.382 --> 12:34.254
AND THERESA DOESN'T KNOW
ABOUT IT.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.457
OOH, REALLY?
VERY MYSTERIOUS.

12:37.457 --> 12:38.929
HAVING AN AFFAIR?
BOTOX?

12:38.929 --> 12:40.160
DIGGING A WELL?
HOG-TYING?

12:40.160 --> 12:41.792
TRAINING MONKEYS?
SKEET SHOOTING?

12:41.792 --> 12:43.493
GRAVE ROBBING?
IT'S GRAVE ROBBING, ISN'T IT?

12:43.493 --> 12:45.866
LOOK AT YOU. IT'S OBVIOUS.
UGH, I'M GONNA BE SICK.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.297
NO, IT'S NONE OF THAT.

12:47.297 --> 12:49.339
JUST AN INNOCENT THING
I DO TO UNWIND.

12:49.339 --> 12:50.340
CAR WASH?
BattleBots?

12:50.340 --> 12:52.102
RIBBON DANCING?
STOP GUESSING.

12:52.102 --> 12:53.303
IT'S JUST SOMEWHERE I GO--

12:53.303 --> 12:55.475
SPAIN.
(scoffs)

12:55.475 --> 12:58.248
IT'S SOMETHING I'VE BEEN DOING
SINCE THE KIDS WERE LITTLE,

12:58.248 --> 13:00.250
BUT IF THERESA FINDS OUT I DON'T
GO DIRECTLY HOME AFTER WORK,

13:00.250 --> 13:03.113
SHE'LL THINK I'M SHIRKING
MY RESPONSIBILITIES AS A DAD.

13:03.113 --> 13:05.015
AREN'T YOU?
YES.

13:05.015 --> 13:09.259
I MEAN, BETWEEN WORK,
THE CHAOS AT HOME, YOU GUYS,

13:09.259 --> 13:11.291
GETTING UP WITH LUCY
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT--

13:11.291 --> 13:13.493
I-I NEED A BREAK.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.225
WELL, IF YOU DON'T WANT THERESA
TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE,

13:15.225 --> 13:16.396
JUST GET RID OF YOUR PHONE.

13:16.396 --> 13:19.429
YEAH. THAT WAY, ANYTIME
YOU WANT, YOU CAN GO TO THE...

13:19.429 --> 13:21.401
TEEN CHOICE AWARDS?
OKTOBERFEST?

13:21.401 --> 13:23.503
GET OUT.

13:25.335 --> 13:26.977
SO I BOUGHT GRANT
THIS NEW SMARTPHONE,

13:26.977 --> 13:29.179
AND NOW HE'S ADDICTED
TO THIS STUPID GAME,

13:29.179 --> 13:30.911
AND HE CAN'T STOP PLAYING IT.

13:30.911 --> 13:33.213
I GUESS YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST
ACCEPTED HIM FOR WHO HE WAS--

13:33.213 --> 13:36.486
A WARM, GENEROUS MAN
WHO BUYS PLANE TICKETS

13:36.486 --> 13:38.548
BY WRITING A LETTER
TO HIS TRAVEL AGENT.

13:38.548 --> 13:39.549
MM.

13:39.549 --> 13:40.550
HEY.

13:40.550 --> 13:42.592
HEY. I WAS LOOKING
FOR YOU TODAY.

13:42.592 --> 13:44.324
YOU WERE OFF THE GRID.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.596
MM. YEAH.
YOU KNOW WHAT? UH...

13:46.596 --> 13:49.499
I GOT RID OF MY PHONE AND, UH,
TOOK GRANT'S OLD PHONE.

13:49.499 --> 13:51.061
WHAT? WHY?

13:51.061 --> 13:53.363
YOU KNOW, GRANT'S RIGHT.
WHO NEEDS ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY?

13:53.363 --> 13:56.506
PLUS THIS THING
IS UNBREAKABLE.
(banging)

13:56.506 --> 13:57.567
HEH.

13:57.567 --> 13:58.939
(rattle)

13:58.939 --> 14:01.041
WELL, THAT PROBABLY
WASN'T A GOOD IDEA.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.013
BUT HOW AM I GONNA KNOW
WHERE YOU ARE ALL THE TIME?

14:03.013 --> 14:06.316
WELL, LOOK INSIDE YOUR HEART,
BABY DOLL.

14:06.316 --> 14:08.378
THAT'S WHERE I'LL ALWAYS BE.

14:10.420 --> 14:14.024
(chuckles) OHH. "BABY DOLL"?
SOMETHING IS UP.

14:14.024 --> 14:15.355
LAST TIME
HE CALLED ME "BABY DOLL,"

14:15.355 --> 14:17.457
HE CLOGGED THE TOILET
AT THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.289
(piano playing)

14:19.289 --> 14:21.131
(clears throat)
LET'S GO HOME, BABY DOLL.

14:21.131 --> 14:23.333
I DON'T NEED
TO MEET THE GOVERNOR.

14:23.333 --> 14:24.965
GOOD LORD.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.997
NEEDLESS TO SAY,
WE HAVE NOT BEEN INVITED BACK.

14:26.997 --> 14:29.539
OHH. WILL'S DEFINITELY
UP TO SOMETHING.

14:29.539 --> 14:31.942
WE SHOULD GO TORTURE KENNY...
YES!

14:31.942 --> 14:34.344
I WAS GONNA SAY,
"TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON."

14:34.344 --> 14:35.545
OH, TORTURING KENNY
WITH A GOAL.

14:35.545 --> 14:38.278
SEEMS A LITTLE STRUCTURED,
BUT OKAY.

14:42.112 --> 14:44.084
(indistinct conversations)

14:44.084 --> 14:46.456
LISTEN UP,
LORD OF THE RING DINGS.

14:46.456 --> 14:48.218
WE NEED SOME ANSWERS.

14:48.218 --> 14:49.589
WHY DID WILL
GET RID OF HIS PHONE?

14:49.589 --> 14:51.891
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT
THERESA TRACKING HIM.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.024
WHAT? WHY NOT?
WHERE IS HE GOING?

14:54.024 --> 14:55.195
I HAVE NO IDEA.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.027
DON'T LIE TO US.
I DON'T LIE.

14:57.027 --> 14:59.429
I'VE SQUEEZED THROUGH
AN UPHOLSTERED BIRTH CANAL

14:59.429 --> 15:01.371
INTO A NEW WORLD OF TRUTH.

15:01.371 --> 15:02.472
BEHOLD.

15:02.472 --> 15:04.274
WHEN WE WERE COMING BACK
FROM BELIZE,

15:04.274 --> 15:06.076
I'M THE ONE
WHO SUGGESTED TO CUSTOMS

15:06.076 --> 15:07.938
THAT YOU WERE SMUGGLING
DIAMONDS INSIDE OF YOU.

15:07.938 --> 15:09.579
THAT WASYOU?

15:09.579 --> 15:11.581
I BELIEVE
THE EXACT PHRASE I USED WAS

15:11.581 --> 15:12.943
"BUTT FULL OF DIAMONDS."

15:12.943 --> 15:15.045
SORRY. I WAS MAD
YOU DIDN'T LET ME

15:15.045 --> 15:16.646
HAVE THE WINDOW SEAT
ON THE PLANE HOME.

15:16.646 --> 15:19.389
ALL RIGHT, NEW HONEST KENNY.

15:19.389 --> 15:21.651
WHATDOYOU KNOW
ABOUT WHAT WILL'S UP TO?

15:21.651 --> 15:24.394
I KNOW THAT EVERY DAY
FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS,

15:24.394 --> 15:26.656
HE'S BEEN SHIRKING HIS PARENTAL
RESPONSIBILITIES AFTER WORK

15:26.656 --> 15:28.298
INSTEAD OF COMING RIGHT HOME.

15:28.298 --> 15:29.659
UNBELIEVABLE.

15:29.659 --> 15:31.962
SO FOR YEARS, MY HUSBAND'S
BEEN LEAVING ME ALONE

15:31.962 --> 15:33.463
AT THE MOST CHAOTIC TIME
OF THE DAY

15:33.463 --> 15:35.635
SO HE CAN RUN AROUND
DOING GOD KNOWS WHAT?

15:35.635 --> 15:37.367
WELL, I'M SHUTTINGTHATDOWN.

15:37.367 --> 15:40.310
HOW? CREEPY POD KENNY
DOESN'T KNOW WHERE HE GOES.

15:40.310 --> 15:42.612
TOMORROW,
I WILL SWING BY WILL'S OFFICE,

15:42.612 --> 15:45.275
SLIP NATHAN'S PHONE
INTO HIS CAR, AND TRACK HIM. HA.

15:45.275 --> 15:46.516
BY THE WAY,

15:46.516 --> 15:49.519
AFTER WE GOT DIVORCED,
I KEPT SEVERAL OF YOUR BRAS.

15:49.519 --> 15:51.121
OCCASIONALLY I LAY ONE
ON THE BACK OF THE COUCH

15:51.121 --> 15:53.353
AND I WATCH A MOVIE WITH IT.

15:54.724 --> 15:56.956
(amplified voice)
THANK YOU, LADIES.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.629
THIS FIRST SONG GOES OUT
TO A CERTAIN WOMAN

15:59.629 --> 16:02.662
WHO'S BEEN DENYING HERSELF
SOMETHING FOR A LONG TIME.

16:02.662 --> 16:08.298

WHAT'S A TURNER?

16:27.017 --> 16:28.658
YOU THINK ALL GAY WOMEN
ARE JUST WAITING

16:28.658 --> 16:31.491
FOR THE RIGHT MAN TO COME ALONG
AND TURN THEM STRAIGHT?

16:31.491 --> 16:32.992

NO! I'M NOT TRYING

AS A POSSIBILITY TO THAT ONE.

16:41.631 --> 16:43.033
(sighs)

16:43.033 --> 16:44.374
HI, RENEE.

16:44.374 --> 16:45.705

SOMETHING FUN TO ME IN THE CAR

16:59.719 --> 17:01.391
WHICH I MAY OR MAY NOT
RECIPROCATE?

17:01.391 --> 17:02.752
UH, NO.

17:02.752 --> 17:04.694

17:09.099 --> 17:10.530
OKAY. WE'RE DONE.

17:10.530 --> 17:13.603
BUT I WAS GONNA
ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR DAY.

17:13.603 --> 17:17.036
(high-pitched voice)
NOW I'M LONELY!

17:18.638 --> 17:22.112
HUH. FRUITY FRUIT SQUARES
NOW COME IN GRAPE.

17:22.112 --> 17:24.814
THAT'S NEW. (sniffs)
GOOD FOR THEM.

17:24.814 --> 17:26.776
HEY, GUYS. YOU SEE THE--

17:26.776 --> 17:29.179
YEAH. FRUITY FRUIT SQUARES
ADDED GRAPE.

17:29.179 --> 17:33.083
WE'RE LIVING IN CRAZY TIMES.
THIS IS RICK, THE NEW GUY.

17:33.083 --> 17:35.155
THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME
JOIN YOUR GROUP.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.426
IT'S CALLED "DADS CLUB."

17:36.426 --> 17:39.159
NOT CALLED "DADS CLUB."
IT'S "HELL'S DADS."

17:39.159 --> 17:40.530
WELL, I LIKED
"DAWN OF THE DADS,"

17:40.530 --> 17:42.632
BUT CARL THOUGHT
IT WAS TOO SPOOKY.

17:42.632 --> 17:44.694
SO HOW'S IT GOING, RICK?

17:44.694 --> 17:46.796
NOT GOOD.

17:46.796 --> 17:48.698
IT'S MY 4-YEAR-OLD.

17:48.698 --> 17:51.701
HE FAVORS MY WIFE OVER ME.
I'M FEELING A LITTLE LEFT OUT.

17:51.701 --> 17:53.843
THAT'S TOUGH, YEAH.
BEEN THERE,
BEEN THERE.

17:53.843 --> 17:55.745
WELL, THE MOTHER-SON BOND
IS STRONG,

17:55.745 --> 17:58.378
BUT YOU WANT TO TRUMP IT?

17:58.378 --> 18:00.250
TEACH THE LITTLE GUY
HOW TO PEE OFF A DECK.

18:00.250 --> 18:01.651
SO TRUE.

18:01.651 --> 18:05.315
THERE'S HIS CAR. WHAT IS HE
DOING AT THE STOP & SIP?

18:05.315 --> 18:08.788
OOH. MAYBE HE'S GOT A MINI-MART
WHORE. THAT'S A REAL THING.
(shifts gears)

18:08.788 --> 18:11.621
I KNOW BECAUSE SOME LADY
YELLED IT AT ME THE OTHER DAY

18:11.621 --> 18:13.823
WHEN I WAS WEARING SHORT SHORTS
AT THE QUICK-N-STOP.

18:13.823 --> 18:15.625
THOSE WERE
INSANELY SHORT SHORTS,

18:15.625 --> 18:17.627
AND I DOUBT
THAT'S WHAT WILL'S DOING.
(seat belt clicks)

18:17.627 --> 18:19.369
BUT HE IS DITCHING ME
AT THE WORST TIME OF THE DAY,

18:19.369 --> 18:20.600
AND FOR THAT, HE PAYS.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.172
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

18:22.172 --> 18:23.533
WHAT? OH.

18:23.533 --> 18:25.605
NATHAN BOUGHT THIS PLASTIC BAT
HERE A FEW WEEKS AGO,

18:25.605 --> 18:27.737
BUT IT HAS A CRACK IN IT,
SO I MIGHT AS WELL RETURN IT.

18:27.737 --> 18:29.839
MM-HMM.

18:29.839 --> 18:32.442
HAVING A FAMILY
AND WORKING FULL-TIME IS HARD,

18:32.442 --> 18:34.514
BUT GETTING TOGETHER
FOR THIS HALF-HOUR

18:34.514 --> 18:35.885
WHERE NO ONE WANTS
ANYTHING FROM ME,

18:35.885 --> 18:39.789
DRINKING 44 OUNCES OF SODA
AND LOOKING AT MAGAZINES--

18:39.789 --> 18:43.653
I MEAN, THAT MAKES ME A BETTER
FATHER AND A BETTER HUSBAND.

18:43.653 --> 18:45.755
THAT'S WHAT "DADLIEST CATCH"
IS ALL ABOUT.

18:45.755 --> 18:48.598
I MEAN, WITHOUT THIS GROUP,
WHICH WE STILL HAVEN'T NAMED,

18:48.598 --> 18:52.402
I WOULD BE COMPLETELY
STRESSED OUT AROUND MY FAMILY,

18:52.402 --> 18:54.764
AND I HAVE THE GREATEST WIFE
IN THE WORLD.

18:54.764 --> 18:56.566
I DON'T WANT TO SCREW THAT UP.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.509
WILL...

18:59.509 --> 19:00.840
THERESA.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.912
WIFE.
WITH A BAT!

19:04.314 --> 19:08.718
UH, I-I JUST STOPPED BY, UH,
TO PICK UP SOME THINGS

19:08.718 --> 19:11.150
ON THE WAY HOME THAT I THOUGHT
THE FAMILY MIGHT ENJOY,

19:11.150 --> 19:13.823
LIKE, SOME, UH,
LIGHTERS, UH--

19:13.823 --> 19:16.526
WILL. IT'S FINE.
I KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE.

19:16.526 --> 19:19.789
KENNY TOLD ME,
AND I AM OKAY WITH IT.

19:19.789 --> 19:21.861
YOU ARE?
PARENTING'S HARD.

19:21.861 --> 19:22.862
WE ALL DO LITTLE THINGS

19:22.862 --> 19:25.195
TO GET US THROUGH
THE HELL OF RAISING CHILDREN.

19:25.195 --> 19:27.166
REALLY?
MM-HMM.

19:27.166 --> 19:27.837
WHAT DOYOUDO?

19:27.837 --> 19:29.539
(inhales sharply)

19:29.539 --> 19:32.802
MOMMY? MOMMY?
MOM? THERESA?

19:32.802 --> 19:36.846
MRS. KEEN?
(sighs) RIDICULOUS.

19:38.908 --> 19:39.809
(Lucy) DADDY?

19:39.809 --> 19:41.651
(Will sputters) YEAH?

19:42.882 --> 19:44.354
SERIOUSLY, WHAT DO YOU DO?

19:44.354 --> 19:48.918
IT'S FINE THAT WE BOTH
HAVE OUR LITTLE SECRETS.

19:48.918 --> 19:50.660
MWAH.

19:50.660 --> 19:52.492
BUT MINE'S
NOT A SECRET ANYMORE.

19:52.492 --> 19:53.923
SEE YOU AT HOME, BABY DOLL.

19:53.923 --> 19:55.765
"BABY DOLL"?

19:58.428 --> 20:00.199
SO I REALIZED SOMETHING.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.672
APPARENTLY, LESBIANS ARE NOT
WOMEN WHO ARE WAITING

20:02.672 --> 20:03.703
FOR THE RIGHT MAN.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.276
THEY'RE ACTUAL LESBIANS.

20:06.276 --> 20:09.379
OHH, LESBIANS.

20:09.379 --> 20:10.510
NO WORD FROM JANE?

20:10.510 --> 20:12.442
IT'S OVER. (sighs)

20:12.442 --> 20:15.785
HONESTY IS NOT A GOOD COLOR
ON THE KENSTER.

20:15.785 --> 20:19.389
NEITHER IS CALLING MYSELF
"THE KENSTER"

20:19.389 --> 20:22.722
OR POINTING AT MYSELF
WITH "THE THUMBSTERS,"

20:22.722 --> 20:26.756
AND THAT'S THE LAST YOU'LL SEE
OF ANY OF THOSE THINGS,

20:26.756 --> 20:27.927
INCLUDING HONESTY.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.999
BY THE WAY,
I REALLY LIKE YOUR MUSIC.

20:29.999 --> 20:31.000
REALLY?

20:31.000 --> 20:33.303
SURE. WHY NOT?

20:33.303 --> 20:34.934
(clink)

20:38.408 --> 20:41.271
♪♪♪

20:41.271 --> 20:43.413
UH, GRANT?

20:43.413 --> 20:46.816
GRANT, THESE NICE THERAPISTS
HELPED KENNY,

20:46.816 --> 20:48.918
AND I THOUGHT MAYBE
THEY COULD HELP YOU, TOO.

20:48.918 --> 20:52.452
IS IT ABOUT THE GAME?
PLEASE BE ABOUT THE GAME.

20:52.452 --> 20:55.585
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE PHONE
AWAY FROM YOU NOW.

20:55.585 --> 20:58.458
GOOD. I WANT YOU TO.

20:58.458 --> 21:00.490
(growls)

21:00.490 --> 21:01.891
DON'T GIVE UP. GRAB IT.

21:01.891 --> 21:04.464
GOOD.

21:04.464 --> 21:06.366
(growls)

21:06.366 --> 21:09.268
IGNORE THAT. HARDER.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.670
YES! (laughs)

21:10.670 --> 21:11.801
STOP!

21:11.801 --> 21:13.943
NO! IGNORE ME! RUN!

21:13.943 --> 21:17.507
GIVE ME THE PHONE! GO!
(crying)
