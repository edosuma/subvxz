WEBVTT

00:03.671 --> 00:04.705
That is it, Ray.

00:04.738 --> 00:06.740
That's the last time
I go to paintball with you.

00:06.774 --> 00:09.510
I mean, the last thing you said
to me was, "I got your back."

00:09.543 --> 00:10.644
I did have your back!

00:10.678 --> 00:13.314
Well, then how
did this happen?

00:13.347 --> 00:15.583
Hey, it's not my fault you
don't understand hand signals.

00:15.616 --> 00:16.650
I clearly said...

00:24.525 --> 00:26.094
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.395
'Cause I thought you said...

00:33.667 --> 00:35.669
Hey, watch your language.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.540
(clattering)

00:39.573 --> 00:41.375
(laughter from kitchen)

00:41.409 --> 00:43.511
KIP:
Shh, shh, shh.

00:43.544 --> 00:44.378
Shh, shh, shh.
(laughing)

00:44.412 --> 00:47.115
Hey! What are you
doing in my kitchen?

00:47.148 --> 00:49.117
We needed a bottle
of tequila

00:49.150 --> 00:50.418
for something
we're making.

00:51.252 --> 00:53.087
What are you making?

00:53.121 --> 00:54.455
Me drunk.

00:54.488 --> 00:56.257
(both laughing)

00:56.290 --> 00:57.191
NATHAN:
You know, Mom,

00:57.225 --> 00:58.626
I'm starting to think
that your roommate

00:58.659 --> 00:59.860
is a bad influence on you.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.629
Oh, lighten up.
(makes fart noise)

01:01.662 --> 01:03.864
This is the only way
I could get her to make

01:03.897 --> 01:05.399
prank calls with me.

01:05.433 --> 01:09.270
I'm calling the mayor
and asking him to prom.

01:09.303 --> 01:10.271
No, you're not using my phone.

01:10.304 --> 01:11.239
Mom...

01:11.272 --> 01:12.240
You're right,
you're right.

01:12.273 --> 01:14.175
You-you got
bigger problems.

01:14.208 --> 01:16.277
Since, uh...
(laughing)

01:16.310 --> 01:19.747
...since your
refrigerator isn't running.

01:19.780 --> 01:21.315
Uh...

01:22.350 --> 01:23.751
Yeah, it is.

01:23.784 --> 01:26.787
(both laughing)

01:26.820 --> 01:29.190
Then...
then you better go...

01:29.223 --> 01:30.758
(both laughing)

01:31.892 --> 01:34.595
(laughing):
I can't!

01:34.628 --> 01:36.264
A fridge...

01:36.297 --> 01:37.665
running...

01:37.698 --> 01:39.200
catch it...

01:39.233 --> 01:41.269
(laughing hysterically)

01:41.302 --> 01:42.870
Shh. Shh.

01:42.903 --> 01:44.838
Listen, listen, listen.

01:44.872 --> 01:47.208
Oh. Oh, hey.

01:47.241 --> 01:48.342
Mayor Hot Stuff?

01:48.376 --> 01:50.344
Shh.

01:50.378 --> 01:52.346
What's that?

01:52.380 --> 01:54.515
Oh, my God, Carol,
I called the wrong number.

01:54.548 --> 01:57.451
(both laughing)

01:57.485 --> 02:00.321
Hey, Dad, how's
the renovations going?

02:27.415 --> 02:28.649
Thanks for
dinner, Deb.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.318
Sorry I didn't eat very much.

02:30.351 --> 02:32.953
I'm on this new diet where
I only eat things with flavor.

02:32.986 --> 02:36.190
Oh, come on! That was funny!

02:36.224 --> 02:38.259
No, Nathan, it wasn't.

02:38.292 --> 02:40.561
Your humor is as bland
as Debbie's cooking.

02:40.594 --> 02:41.895
(laughter)

02:43.597 --> 02:45.233
(laughing)

02:45.266 --> 02:47.401
I didn't hear.
What did he say?

02:47.435 --> 02:50.371
Oh, Kip, you got to come over
for dinner more often.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.373
You're more than Mom's roommate;
you're a part of this family.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.475
Aw. I've always wanted
a cute little sister.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.476
(giggles)

02:55.509 --> 02:56.977
And a much
older brother.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.280
Wait. Me?

02:59.313 --> 03:00.848
No, I'm not older than you.

03:00.881 --> 03:03.584
Well, you said before
you're 43 years old

03:03.617 --> 03:05.953
and I just sent out the Evite
for my 35th birthday, so...

03:05.986 --> 03:07.521
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait...

03:07.555 --> 03:08.789
You're... (snorts)

03:08.822 --> 03:09.823
You're 34?

03:11.592 --> 03:13.261
What year were you born?

03:13.294 --> 03:14.595
1979.
What year did you
graduate high school?

03:14.628 --> 03:15.996
1998.
Who shot J.R.?

03:16.029 --> 03:18.232
I'm not familiar
with the reference.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.535
Debbie, did your mail
come today?

03:21.569 --> 03:22.536
Uh, yeah, it's in
the living room.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.572
Oh, let's go look
at Debbie's celebrity mags

03:24.605 --> 03:26.340
for tattoo ideas.

03:26.374 --> 03:27.808
You know, I always wanted
to get a tattoo,

03:27.841 --> 03:29.843
but they told me
my skin is too thin.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.448
Mom is thinking
about getting a tattoo?

03:34.482 --> 03:35.549
Can you believe this?

03:35.583 --> 03:37.451
I don't know. You had
an earring for three years.

03:37.485 --> 03:39.620
Well, yeah, it was the '80s.

03:39.653 --> 03:42.956
You had to look stupid
just to fit in.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.592
I always wanted an earring,

03:44.625 --> 03:46.560
but we couldn't afford any
real jewelry on the commune,

03:46.594 --> 03:49.630
so I just glued
a piece of corn to my ear.

03:51.832 --> 03:55.703
It was so cool
until the crows came.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.738
CAROL:
Nathan! Debbie!

04:00.574 --> 04:03.511
Did you see this letter
from Central Elementary?

04:03.544 --> 04:05.513
No. Is it some sort
of announcement

04:05.546 --> 04:07.481
giving you permission to open
other people's mail?

04:09.517 --> 04:10.484
It was sent to me.

04:10.518 --> 04:12.920
I guess I never updated
my address with them.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.455
And look at this.

04:14.488 --> 04:17.691
It's an invitation
to a retirement party for...

04:17.725 --> 04:19.893
Miss Pam.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.061
KIP:
Ooh.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.630
I smell a rivalry.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.365
You know, Kip, I doubt my mom

04:24.398 --> 04:25.866
wants to rehash
all the ugly details...

04:25.899 --> 04:29.303
For decades,
I dedicated my life

04:29.337 --> 04:32.806
to being a model educator
at Central Elementary.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.943
My students looked at me with
a mix of fear, love and respect

04:35.976 --> 04:38.812
usually reserved
for popular dictators.

04:38.846 --> 04:40.514
The semicolon is

04:40.548 --> 04:42.883
a powerful mark of punctuation
with three uses.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.452
Tammy, name them.

04:44.485 --> 04:47.621
Connections, transitions
and complex lists.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.457
And, class, how do we use them?

04:49.490 --> 04:51.625
KIDS:
With respect!

04:54.962 --> 04:57.331
(ukelele playing)

04:57.365 --> 04:58.799
CAROL:
But then, one day,

04:58.832 --> 05:00.668
Miss Pam arrived,

05:00.701 --> 05:03.404
with a pair of bosoms
so prominently displayed,

05:03.437 --> 05:06.440
it was like there were
three globes in the room.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.710
* It's a comma with a hat

05:09.743 --> 05:12.012
* And if you just
remember that *

05:12.045 --> 05:13.814
* That's all you need to know

05:13.847 --> 05:15.583
* About semicolons.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.751
Hey. Could you
keep it down?

05:17.785 --> 05:19.720
Some of us are trying to teach.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.655
What are you trying
to teach them?

05:21.689 --> 05:23.557
How to hate learning?

05:23.591 --> 05:24.725
(children laugh)

05:24.758 --> 05:25.926
You might want to cover up.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.728
I wouldn't want you to lose
something in your cleavage,

05:27.761 --> 05:28.962
like your car keys.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.364
Or your car.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.066
And when things like

05:33.100 --> 05:35.669
the new overhead projector
arrived, it didn't matter

05:35.703 --> 05:37.471
who needed it most.

05:37.505 --> 05:39.407
The administration
would always look her way.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.710
And when Principal Horne
finally retired...

05:42.743 --> 05:44.945
...and to replace me
as principal,

05:44.978 --> 05:47.581
no one is more deserving than...

05:48.782 --> 05:50.017
...Miss Pam.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.452
(squeals)

05:53.120 --> 05:54.788
CAROL:
When I started teaching,

05:54.822 --> 05:56.757
it was all about "A"s.

05:56.790 --> 05:59.727
But after Miss Pam,
all anyone cared about

05:59.760 --> 06:01.462
were the double "D"s.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.866
So my biggest enemy
became my boss.

06:05.899 --> 06:09.136
If you're just joining us,
Kip is on the edge of his seat.

06:09.169 --> 06:11.572
Thank you, Kip.

06:11.605 --> 06:12.372
Retiring?

06:12.406 --> 06:14.675
Why would she retire
at that age?

06:14.708 --> 06:17.745
Oh, I bet it's because
her boobs are starting to sag.

06:19.012 --> 06:21.014
I hear that happens
to some women.

06:22.583 --> 06:23.617
Mom, that was ten years ago.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.118
You just need to let it go.

06:25.152 --> 06:26.854
She's the one
who can't let it go.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.889
Inviting me
to her retirement party?

06:28.922 --> 06:31.659
I'll tell you
what I think of that.

06:34.695 --> 06:37.164
Good Lord,
that's a quality cardstock.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.200
You know what you
should do, Carol?

06:40.233 --> 06:41.635
You should go to that party

06:41.669 --> 06:43.537
and give that woman
a piece of your mind.

06:43.571 --> 06:44.672
You think so?

06:44.705 --> 06:45.839
Oh, gosh, sorry.
You know what?

06:45.873 --> 06:47.675
I just remembered I forgot
to scrape any of the cheese

06:47.708 --> 06:48.776
off those dinner plates.

06:48.809 --> 06:49.977
Uh, you know,
it's probably fine.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.012
It'll be easy to scrape off
in the morning, right, Mom?

06:52.045 --> 06:54.582
No, Nathan! How many times
do I have to remind you?

06:54.615 --> 06:57.184
Cheese on a plate
makes a morning you hate.

06:57.217 --> 07:00.087
It's like nobody reads
my needlepoints.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.655
What is wrong with you?

07:01.689 --> 07:03.223
My mom can't go to that thing.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.958
Wait a second.
Did you just purposely divert

07:04.992 --> 07:06.093
your mother into the kitchen?

07:06.126 --> 07:07.094
Yes, I did.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.929
Yeah, look, Kip,
our mom can't go to that party.

07:08.962 --> 07:09.897
Why not?

07:09.930 --> 07:12.466
She clearly has emotions
about this Miss Pam

07:12.500 --> 07:13.734
that she's been
storing up for years.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.803
Your mother is
an emotional hoarder.

07:15.836 --> 07:19.973
She collects grudges like
they're Cool Whip containers.

07:20.007 --> 07:23.744
The cheese was already stuck,
so I put it in soapy water.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.946
Soak overnight, morning delight.

07:25.979 --> 07:27.881
You know, Carol,

07:27.915 --> 07:30.618
I'd like to hear more
about Miss Pam.

07:30.651 --> 07:33.186
Uh... oh, my God,
I just remembered.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.822
Silly me.

07:34.855 --> 07:36.189
Left my wallet
in the car.

07:36.223 --> 07:38.626
Although... it's
probably fine.

07:38.659 --> 07:39.760
Are you crazy?

07:39.793 --> 07:41.729
A wallet in a car is thief bait!

07:43.664 --> 07:45.666
How much you want?
Ten grand? 20 grand?

07:45.699 --> 07:47.868
To just walk out that door
and never come back.

07:47.901 --> 07:49.269
Okay.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.805
Look, Kip, I know that you
think that you're helping her,

07:51.839 --> 07:53.774
but maybe in this case
we know what's best.

07:53.807 --> 07:54.942
Yeah, you tend
to get to know somebody

07:54.975 --> 07:56.109
after you spend
43 years with them.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.045
Well, that would be
impossible for me to do,

07:58.078 --> 08:01.715
since I'm five days shy of 35.

08:01.749 --> 08:02.850
What's your Chinese zodiac?

08:02.883 --> 08:04.117
Goat. Specifically,
an earth goat,

08:04.151 --> 08:06.286
and my lucky flowers
are carnation, primrose
and Alyce flower.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.522
What else you got, Gramps?

08:14.795 --> 08:17.130
Are you sure we
should be here, Kip?

08:17.164 --> 08:17.931
I'm positive.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.900
You need to move
past this.
Yeah.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.269
Just remember you're powerful,
you're beautiful,

08:22.302 --> 08:24.805
and if she comes at you,
hit her high.

08:24.838 --> 08:25.973
She's bound to tip over.

08:27.808 --> 08:28.776
Yep, there they are.

08:28.809 --> 08:29.910
I knew it.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.278
We came looking for you
at your apartment

08:31.311 --> 08:32.846
and you weren't there,
and I went to Debbie's

08:32.880 --> 08:34.247
and she said that
she hadn't seen you,

08:34.281 --> 08:35.883
and then I put together

08:35.916 --> 08:37.985
that this lunatic
must have brought you here.

08:38.018 --> 08:38.952
Carol needs this.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.921
She needs to let Miss Pam
know how she feels.

08:40.954 --> 08:41.822
That's right.

08:41.855 --> 08:45.058
I need to get her
chest off my chest.

08:45.092 --> 08:46.059
And look at this party

08:46.093 --> 08:48.028
she flirted the school
board into throwing her.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.930
Scallops wrapped
in bacon?

08:49.963 --> 08:51.899
The only protein at
my retirement party

08:51.932 --> 08:53.801
was a cricket that
got in the punch.

08:53.834 --> 08:56.003
Mom, you've got to
stop listening to him.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.137
I mean, you're...

08:57.170 --> 08:59.206
you're taking life advice
from a guy

08:59.239 --> 09:02.943
who still thinks
he's in his mid-30s.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.111
Ignore him, Carol.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.046
This will be cathartic.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.181
I once confronted
the ice cream man

09:08.215 --> 09:10.718
who always drove away
when I came running up.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.986
Turns out, I had been
chasing the exterminator

09:13.020 --> 09:14.554
whose horn played music.

09:16.123 --> 09:18.125
That's why I'm so thin
and know seven different ways

09:18.158 --> 09:21.194
to get a rat out of the attic.

09:24.131 --> 09:26.233
Ah! There
she is now.

09:26.266 --> 09:27.935
If you'll excuse me.

09:30.838 --> 09:34.007
Wow, those things
haven't sagged an inch.

09:34.041 --> 09:36.944
I should get her boob guy
to redo my couch.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.912
(gasps) Carol!

09:38.946 --> 09:41.615
Oh, I'm glad you
could make it.

09:41.649 --> 09:45.919
And with the exact same hairdo
you had 25 years ago.

09:45.953 --> 09:46.987
You know, usually

09:47.020 --> 09:49.289
people only stick
with something when it works.

09:49.322 --> 09:50.991
That's not true.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.292
You stuck with teaching.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.195
I was an excellent teacher.

09:55.228 --> 09:56.730
Better than you.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.899
Why else would they
have made me principal?

09:58.932 --> 10:01.601
I can think of two reasons:
boop, boop.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.105
Those things got you everything.

10:05.138 --> 10:07.240
A projector, promotion

10:07.274 --> 10:10.644
and the only classroom
without asbestos.

10:10.678 --> 10:12.946
And that is
exactly why the school board

10:12.980 --> 10:14.882
threw you this elaborate party.

10:14.915 --> 10:17.985
Carol, you poor,
misguided mess.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.953
You think the school
board did all this?

10:19.987 --> 10:23.123
My students are the ones
who paid for this party.

10:23.156 --> 10:24.124
What?
Yeah.

10:24.157 --> 10:24.958
My students!

10:24.992 --> 10:27.027
And they dug up
all the time capsules

10:27.060 --> 10:28.896
that our class has buried,
just so I could read

10:28.929 --> 10:30.931
all the wonderful letters
that they'd written

10:30.964 --> 10:33.967
about their favorite teacher,
Miss Pam!

10:38.972 --> 10:41.041
Hey, Mom, are you okay?

10:41.074 --> 10:42.876
Her students threw her
this party.

10:42.910 --> 10:45.012
My students didn't
throw me a party.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.880
I mean, I know I was strict,
but I thought

10:46.914 --> 10:48.849
at least they appreciated it.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.117
Oh, I'm sure they did.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.685
And they would've
thrown you a party

10:51.719 --> 10:53.954
if there'd been a Facebook
and a Twitter back then.

10:53.987 --> 10:57.424
Oh, social media!
(growls)

10:57.457 --> 10:59.960
Ladies and gentlemen, reading
us letters from 20 years ago,

10:59.993 --> 11:02.095
please welcome Miss Pam!

11:02.129 --> 11:04.264
(whooping)

11:07.134 --> 11:09.302
"I can't wait
until I'm all growed up

11:09.336 --> 11:12.039
so me and Miss Pam
can get married."

11:12.072 --> 11:13.974
Talk to me
after the party, Charlie.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.275
(clicks tongue)

11:15.308 --> 11:17.077
Maybe she was
the better teacher.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.780
I never got a Valentine
from one of my kids.

11:19.813 --> 11:22.983
Even when I made it mandatory.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.085
"I love school with Miss Pam.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.054
She's the bestest teacher ever."

11:27.087 --> 11:28.121
Aw.

11:28.155 --> 11:31.224
No, you're the bestest, Rachel.

11:31.258 --> 11:34.361
Ooh, there's
just so many of them!

11:34.394 --> 11:36.229
* So many letters,
we're gonna be here *

11:36.263 --> 11:38.265
* All night.

11:41.168 --> 11:44.104
If you'll excuse me a second,
I-I need to get some fresh air.

11:45.105 --> 11:46.807
Oh, God.

11:46.840 --> 11:49.042
I feel sorry for whoever
drove here in the smallest car,

11:49.076 --> 11:51.211
because that thing's
about to get flipped.

11:51.244 --> 11:53.847
She's probably going
for a nice, long walk

11:53.881 --> 11:55.983
to calmly evaluate
what happened

11:56.016 --> 11:57.851
and to let the
healing process begin.

11:57.885 --> 12:01.021
Yeah, that doesn't
sound like Mom.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.928
(alarm blaring)

12:07.961 --> 12:10.297
(woman shrieks)

12:10.330 --> 12:12.332
That sounds like Mom!

12:20.240 --> 12:22.075
You guys have to help me.

12:22.109 --> 12:23.343
There's something
wrong with your mom.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.278
She's just staring into space.

12:25.312 --> 12:27.414
I watched a fly walk
across her eyeball.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.550
Well, hang on a second, Kip.

12:30.583 --> 12:35.856
I, uh, I know it's tacky to say
I told you so, but, uh...

12:35.889 --> 12:37.490
check your phone.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.526
I didn't bring it.

12:39.559 --> 12:42.295
It says I told you so!

12:42.329 --> 12:43.363
Okay, fine.

12:43.396 --> 12:44.497
I get it.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.133
You're right. I'm sorry.

12:46.166 --> 12:49.903
I just don't have
the life experience that you do.

12:49.937 --> 12:52.472
Look, it's not the first time
that Mom has been in a funk.

12:52.505 --> 12:54.875
All right? Everything
will be fine just as long as

12:54.908 --> 12:57.244
she's not moping around
in her depression hoodie.

12:57.277 --> 13:00.213
You mean that ratty green thing
that smells like a hamster cage?

13:00.247 --> 13:02.482
Oh, no, Nathan--
the depression hoodie.

13:02.515 --> 13:06.153
She hasn't worn that since Tom
Selleck shaved his mustache!

13:07.520 --> 13:10.423
And she hasn't eaten anything
but Crystal Light in days.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.259
She's not even
mixing it with water.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.526
She's sucking it
straight from the packet!

13:14.527 --> 13:16.129
Oh, God.

13:16.163 --> 13:17.397
She's on the Crystal.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.207
Hey, Mom.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.376
How you doing?

13:29.409 --> 13:33.213
Brought you some water
to go with your Crystal Light.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.320
Don't get too close.

13:40.353 --> 13:41.321
She spits.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.490
Oh, it's okay.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.125
Debbie and I got some tricks

13:45.158 --> 13:47.227
that always get her
out of her funk.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.197
Hey, Mom?

13:50.230 --> 13:52.565
I was thinking about
purchasing a major appliance.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.501
You think I should
just go ahead and buy

13:54.534 --> 13:57.370
the first one I see
without comparison shopping?

13:59.072 --> 14:00.974
Save your money.

14:01.008 --> 14:02.475
Get some breast implants.

14:05.412 --> 14:07.414
I got this, I got this.
I got it.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.249
Okay, okay, okay.

14:11.551 --> 14:13.253
Hey, Mommy?

14:13.286 --> 14:15.255
I think I have a fever.

14:15.288 --> 14:17.925
Would you mind checking with
your lips against my forehead?

14:17.958 --> 14:21.328
It's always so much more
accurate than a thermometer.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.395
What's the point?

14:22.429 --> 14:24.397
We're all gonna die.

14:24.431 --> 14:26.166
And my students aren't

14:26.199 --> 14:28.368
gonna come to my funeral.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.438
Okay, well, we'll-we'll
go chew on that...

14:31.471 --> 14:33.506
She's gonna spit!
Go! Go! Go!

14:37.310 --> 14:39.546
The only way that Mom
is gonna feel better

14:39.579 --> 14:42.115
is if she thinks that
her students loved her.

14:42.149 --> 14:44.684
What we need are a bunch of
great letters like Miss Pam had.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.086
Good luck with that.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.620
Carol's not getting
a letter from a student

14:47.654 --> 14:51.358
unless it's coming through
a window tied to a brick.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.126
Wait a second!

14:53.160 --> 14:55.062
What if we just
write our own letters?

14:55.095 --> 14:57.564
We tell Mom that we dug up
her old time capsule,

14:57.597 --> 15:00.000
and just replace the letters.
Yeah.

15:00.033 --> 15:01.468
It's not a bad idea,
but we don't know

15:01.501 --> 15:03.070
any of her students' names.
Plus, you know Mom.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.005
She's never gonna believe it
unless she takes them

15:05.038 --> 15:06.439
out of the actual time capsule.

15:06.473 --> 15:08.075
She's right.
Carol can spot a lie

15:08.108 --> 15:09.109
from a mile away. Literally.

15:09.142 --> 15:11.511
Once, I told her I was sick
so I could get out

15:11.544 --> 15:13.480
of going on a hot air
balloon ride with her.

15:13.513 --> 15:15.983
She spotted me having a picnic.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.617
From a mile away.

15:19.486 --> 15:21.321
Fine. You know what?
We'll go to the school

15:21.354 --> 15:23.623
and dig up the actual time
capsule and replace the letters.

15:23.656 --> 15:24.992
Yeah, yeah!

15:25.025 --> 15:26.994
And we'll have
Mikayla and Dad write them

15:27.027 --> 15:29.963
so the handwriting looks like
it was done by sixth graders.

15:29.997 --> 15:31.098
(laughs)

15:31.131 --> 15:33.400
Cursive really
throws me for a loop.

15:33.433 --> 15:34.701
Pun intended.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.236
(laughs)

15:36.269 --> 15:37.437
I've been waiting many years

15:37.470 --> 15:40.140
for the topic of handwriting
to come up.

15:41.641 --> 15:44.144
Anyone want to talk
about the trombone?

15:53.686 --> 15:55.688
Ooh, I got one!

15:57.690 --> 16:01.628
Oh, Mr. Hoover's class 1978.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.663
(groans)

16:04.731 --> 16:05.498
Oh, hey, look.

16:05.532 --> 16:07.300
There's a Charleston Chew
in here.

16:07.334 --> 16:09.136
Can't find those anymore, huh?

16:09.169 --> 16:10.737
Just dig!
We wouldn't even be out here

16:10.770 --> 16:12.205
if it wasn't for you!

16:12.239 --> 16:14.407
I already apologized!

16:14.441 --> 16:16.276
Geez, someone needs
to watch Frozen

16:16.309 --> 16:18.745
and learn to "Let It Go."

16:18.778 --> 16:19.779
(metal clangs)

16:19.812 --> 16:21.548
Oh, I hit something.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.416
Guys! I found it!

16:23.450 --> 16:24.517
Okay, great. All right.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.153
Let's fill these holes back up
and get out of here.

16:26.186 --> 16:30.323
My... my shovel's stuck
in a time capsule.

16:34.594 --> 16:37.064
Nathan, I think you hit a pipe!

16:37.097 --> 16:39.666
Yeah, that's not a capsule.
That's a water pipe.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.268
Really?

16:41.301 --> 16:43.170
You think I hit a pipe?

16:43.203 --> 16:44.337
I do!

16:44.371 --> 16:45.605
Yeah, Debbie's right.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.140
That's a pipe.

16:47.174 --> 16:49.242
(scoffs)
Dummy!

16:49.276 --> 16:51.278
That's it.

16:51.311 --> 16:53.580
I'm killing you.

16:56.783 --> 16:59.619
(laughing)

17:06.459 --> 17:07.694
(grunting)

17:07.727 --> 17:09.829
Will you stop it?!
You're being ridiculous!

17:09.862 --> 17:11.431
(both grunting)

17:12.599 --> 17:14.667
(screams)

17:16.736 --> 17:19.106
Oh, get ready
to get your hair pulled.

17:19.139 --> 17:22.842
I earned a ton of extra money
in college doing this!

17:22.875 --> 17:24.544
(all yelling)

17:26.846 --> 17:28.281
Dear God!

17:28.315 --> 17:30.250
(siren whoops)

17:30.283 --> 17:32.285
(car doors open)

17:39.826 --> 17:41.728
Where are they?

17:41.761 --> 17:43.796
Your three little hoodlums

17:43.830 --> 17:45.665
are in the locker room
getting cleaned up

17:45.698 --> 17:46.833
because they were a mess.

17:46.866 --> 17:49.068
(clears throat)

17:52.772 --> 17:54.107
Look at you!

17:54.141 --> 17:56.409
What do you have to say
for yourselves?

17:56.443 --> 17:58.578
Well, I can't speak
for these two.

17:58.611 --> 18:01.481
But I got to say
that I'm kind of proud

18:01.514 --> 18:03.750
that I still fit into
12-year-olds' gym shorts.

18:05.818 --> 18:07.720
What were you all doing?

18:07.754 --> 18:09.322
They were looking for this.

18:09.356 --> 18:11.291
My old time capsule?

18:11.324 --> 18:12.659
Why would you want
to dig that up?

18:12.692 --> 18:14.294
We thought it might
make you feel better

18:14.327 --> 18:15.728
to read some of your students'
old letters.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.464
You did that for me?

18:17.497 --> 18:18.465
You're right.

18:18.498 --> 18:20.800
I-I would like to see
what those letters say.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.335
Uh, don't open that!

18:22.369 --> 18:23.836
Might be full of spiders!
Or rusty edges!

18:23.870 --> 18:27.240
Or terrible letters.
I mean, more spiders.

18:27.274 --> 18:29.842
I already opened it
and read all the letters.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.144
In fact, let me share

18:31.178 --> 18:33.713
my favorite one
from Jay Simmons.

18:33.746 --> 18:35.715
"Dear Citizens of the Future,

18:35.748 --> 18:37.717
"if time machines
have been invented,

18:37.750 --> 18:38.851
"please come back and save me

18:38.885 --> 18:42.689
from the detestable hell
that is Mrs. Miller's class."

18:42.722 --> 18:44.891
Let me see those.

18:44.924 --> 18:47.194
(sighs)
This one's from Mike Fisher.

18:47.227 --> 18:48.361
I loved him.

18:48.395 --> 18:50.197
"The devil is not dead.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.864
"Rather she is
walking amongst us

18:51.898 --> 18:53.866
"in an array of oversized tops

18:53.900 --> 18:56.436
sporting way too much
tropical fruit."

18:56.469 --> 18:59.172
From Erica Temple.

18:59.206 --> 19:00.840
Sweet girl.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.775
"I am so eternally grateful
that I was

19:02.809 --> 19:05.512
assigned to Mrs. Miller's
class this year."

19:05.545 --> 19:06.679
Hey, that's a good one.
Let's end on that.

19:06.713 --> 19:08.248
"If I hadn't been
assigned to her,

19:08.281 --> 19:09.649
"then my parents' divorce

19:09.682 --> 19:11.818
"would've been the worst thing
that happened this year.

19:11.851 --> 19:14.787
"Instead, the bitter custody
trial proved a welcome relief

19:14.821 --> 19:18.591
from the agony
of her lugubrious classroom."

19:22.895 --> 19:25.332
Mom... you don't deserve that.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.200
That's just mean.

19:27.234 --> 19:29.336
"Lugubrious"?
Is that a good thing?

19:29.369 --> 19:32.872
No. It means "sad and dismal."

19:32.905 --> 19:35.642
Actually, what it means
is that my sixth graders

19:35.675 --> 19:38.778
were writing
at a 12th-grade level.

19:38.811 --> 19:41.681
Look at this perfectly used
semicolon right here.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.783
"The devil is not dead--
semicolon--

19:43.816 --> 19:46.919
rather-- comma--
she is walking amongst us."

19:46.953 --> 19:50.457
And right now
I'm walking mighty proud.

19:50.490 --> 19:51.924
NATHAN:
Yeah, mom.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.326
You know what?
You're right.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.761
I mean, look.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.896
Look at...
look at Miss Pam's letters.

19:56.929 --> 19:58.298
I mean, they're filled
with mistakes.

19:58.331 --> 19:59.299
And this handwriting?

19:59.332 --> 20:02.001
It looks like they wrote
these with their feet.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.836
Well, at least they liked me.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.438
Well, good for you.

20:05.472 --> 20:08.007
I didn't sign up to be
a teacher so I could be

20:08.040 --> 20:10.877
best friends
with a bunch of sixth graders.

20:10.910 --> 20:13.413
My goal was to lay my head
on my pillow every night

20:13.446 --> 20:15.815
knowing I'd given my kids
a great education

20:15.848 --> 20:18.017
whether they liked me or not.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.819
So, I'm fine if your students

20:19.852 --> 20:22.655
think you are the
bestest-- semicolon--

20:22.689 --> 20:25.592
I'd rather be remembered
as the best-- period.

20:28.295 --> 20:30.997
She just combined
two independent clauses.

20:31.030 --> 20:34.701
Uh, I know that
'cause I was in her class.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.271
And I wasn't.

20:38.305 --> 20:41.774
Which is why I have no idea
what an independent clause is.

20:41.808 --> 20:42.875
(clicks tongue)

20:47.914 --> 20:50.016
(blows raspberry)

20:52.319 --> 20:54.854
Boy. Carol's
one hell of a teacher

20:54.887 --> 20:56.889
for you to be able
to remember all the things

20:56.923 --> 20:59.559
she taught you
over 30 years ago.

20:59.592 --> 21:03.463
You've had my entire lifetime
to forget it.

21:03.496 --> 21:04.631
Who's your favorite
Charlie's Angel?

21:04.664 --> 21:05.765
Lucy Liu.
No, from the TV show.

21:05.798 --> 21:16.042
Didn't know there was one.
Oh, damn it!

21:16.075 --> 21:18.277
