00:21.000 --> 00:21.750
Cool, man.

00:21.750 --> 00:23.125
I'm not even tripping off that.

00:23.125 --> 00:25.583
It's the whole setup they
got going down there.

00:25.583 --> 00:27.875
Nightclubs do
whatever they want.

00:27.875 --> 00:30.333
Man, we were waiting in
that line for like an hour.

00:30.333 --> 00:32.125
They just kept
grabbing random THOTs

00:32.125 --> 00:33.542
and pulling them to
the front of the line

00:33.542 --> 00:34.625
like we don't even exist.

00:34.625 --> 00:35.250
OK.

00:35.250 --> 00:38.042
So if you're running
a club, are you

00:38.042 --> 00:41.959
gonna have all the ugly, sweaty
dudes making all of the girls

00:41.959 --> 00:43.542
uncomfortable?

00:43.542 --> 00:46.792
Or are you gonna have
the most beautiful women

00:46.792 --> 00:50.709
picked from the line,
packed in one room?

00:50.709 --> 00:51.625
You're right.

00:51.625 --> 00:52.583
Yeah.

00:52.583 --> 00:54.583
It's all about the ratio, man.

00:54.583 --> 00:55.000
You're right.

00:55.000 --> 00:55.375
You're right.

00:55.375 --> 00:58.083
It's just, I hate feeling like
I'm at the bottom of the totem

00:58.083 --> 00:59.750
pole, you know?

00:59.750 --> 01:01.917
You're a trip, man.

01:01.917 --> 01:03.417
I'm never standing
in that line again.

01:07.709 --> 01:09.500
Dude, no way, man.

01:09.500 --> 01:11.208
The new professor's
gonna be pissed.

01:11.208 --> 01:13.126
We need a film with
some substance.

01:13.126 --> 01:17.417
I'm not a film major so that
I can make practical films.

01:17.417 --> 01:21.291
I make films so that I
can tell stories, OK?

01:21.291 --> 01:25.001
So let's focus on
the action first,

01:25.001 --> 01:28.041
and then we can bring in
the swordsman, all right?

01:28.041 --> 01:34.875
Open on a knight
riding in, decked out

01:34.875 --> 01:38.834
in a suit of glowing
silver armor, eh?

01:38.834 --> 01:45.166
And then on his horse, he's
waving his country's flag.

01:45.166 --> 01:47.291
OK, Tarantino, so where
we gonna get a horse?

01:47.291 --> 01:49.208
I've got some hillbilly
cousins out east.

01:49.208 --> 01:50.208
Oh, cool, cool.

01:50.208 --> 01:51.209
OK.

01:51.209 --> 01:54.333
What about, um, the glowing
armor and the waving flag?

01:54.333 --> 01:58.750
You know, I go to the movies
to see something extraordinary,

01:58.750 --> 02:01.126
not some shit that
I could do at home.

02:01.126 --> 02:03.917
Well, maybe if your broke ass
made some extraordinary money,

02:03.917 --> 02:06.208
then maybe we could fund
some of your bullshit ideas.

02:06.208 --> 02:07.917
I've already figured
out a way for us

02:07.917 --> 02:09.250
to make some cash this summer.

02:09.250 --> 02:10.625
Now, that's what I want to hear.

02:10.625 --> 02:12.458
So there's this big
party coming up.

02:12.458 --> 02:13.291
Dude, no, no, no, no.

02:13.291 --> 02:13.750
Hell no.

02:13.750 --> 02:15.458
I told you, I'm not
gonna be a stripper.

02:15.458 --> 02:18.084
Not the stripper
idea this time, OK?

02:18.084 --> 02:20.625
Your nipples are way
too small, anyway.

02:20.625 --> 02:22.041
They're like Raisinets.

02:22.041 --> 02:23.250
It would never work.

02:23.250 --> 02:24.333
It wouldn't work.

02:24.333 --> 02:25.834
Yo, stop talking
about my nipples.

02:25.834 --> 02:28.625
I shot the-- the host of
the party a DM, though,

02:28.625 --> 02:31.084
and he's totally down
for us to film it.

02:31.084 --> 02:31.458
Shit.

02:31.458 --> 02:32.583
How much?

02:32.583 --> 02:33.959
$100.

02:33.959 --> 02:34.583
That's it?

02:34.583 --> 02:38.001
That's $100 more than we
have right now, isn't it?

02:38.001 --> 02:39.917
Look, aren't your
parents paying your rent?

02:39.917 --> 02:40.291
No.

02:40.291 --> 02:42.042
Actually, student loans are.

02:42.042 --> 02:44.542
See, this is why we
need this money, OK?

02:44.542 --> 02:47.792
This could lead to more
parties and more money.

02:47.792 --> 02:48.667
What kind of parties?

02:48.667 --> 02:49.041
House party?

02:51.209 --> 02:54.000
I'm the life of the party,
taking shots of Bacardi.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.458
Shawty acting naughty.

02:55.458 --> 02:57.625
Jello shots off her body.

02:57.625 --> 03:01.209
Life of the party,
taking shots of Bacardi.

03:01.209 --> 03:02.625
Shawty acting naughty.

03:02.625 --> 03:04.583
Jello shots off her body.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.500
Shawty acting naughty.

03:16.500 --> 03:17.917
Jello shots off her body.

03:17.917 --> 03:21.291
The life of the party.

03:21.291 --> 03:25.291
I'm the life of the party.

03:25.291 --> 03:27.875
Life of the party.

03:27.875 --> 03:31.875
I'm the life of the party.

03:31.875 --> 03:34.083
So how'd you feel about
that jello wrestling?

03:34.083 --> 03:36.084
Oh my god, that was amazing.

03:36.084 --> 03:37.166
You should have been there.

03:37.166 --> 03:39.750
Yes, you watching this video,
you should have been there.

03:39.750 --> 03:40.667
It was epic.

03:40.667 --> 03:41.333
It was epic.

03:41.333 --> 03:42.000
It was epic.

03:42.000 --> 03:42.792
Were you there?

03:42.792 --> 03:43.417
I was there.

03:43.417 --> 03:45.042
He was there, ladies
and gentlemen.

03:45.042 --> 03:46.291
He was there.

03:46.291 --> 03:49.291
Cut.

03:54.333 --> 03:59.875
Yo, we
can't post this.

03:59.875 --> 04:01.834
What?

04:01.834 --> 04:03.250
We can't post this!

04:03.250 --> 04:05.792
I don't think you realize
what this is gonna do for us.

04:05.792 --> 04:08.000
Yeah, I don't think you realize
what this could do to us.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.001
You want more views and
followers on social media,

04:11.001 --> 04:12.001
right?

04:12.001 --> 04:13.875
This is how.

04:13.875 --> 04:18.709
We have footage, Cody, of
a hundred misdemeanors.

04:18.709 --> 04:21.041
Not everyone there was over 21.

04:21.041 --> 04:22.041
I don't care.

04:22.041 --> 04:25.001
Any press is good press.

04:25.001 --> 04:28.209
This could put us on the
map as videographers, bro.

04:28.209 --> 04:30.375
I don't think you realize
how much attention this is

04:30.375 --> 04:32.126
gonna bring.

04:32.126 --> 04:33.792
You know you want this.

04:33.792 --> 04:34.875
Let me think.

04:34.875 --> 04:39.709
More views, more money, more t--

04:39.709 --> 04:40.208
Yeah, shut up.

04:40.208 --> 04:42.333
Let me think.

04:42.333 --> 04:44.001
Let me see the footage.

04:47.125 --> 04:51.458
Do you remember the chick
with the jelly beans, man?

04:51.458 --> 04:55.084
She, like-- I don't know
how she got that whole bag--

04:55.084 --> 04:57.167
I got it.

04:57.167 --> 04:58.041
You got it?

04:58.041 --> 04:59.458
I got it.

04:59.458 --> 05:01.125
I'll blur their faces.

05:01.125 --> 05:02.542
Their identities are safe.

05:02.542 --> 05:03.917
Our asses are covered.

05:03.917 --> 05:05.542
Full recognition.

05:08.208 --> 05:12.083
Yo, but, uh, let me
talk to Kay first.

05:12.083 --> 05:13.875
What?

05:13.875 --> 05:15.625
I want to talk to Kay first.

05:15.625 --> 05:17.667
Aren't y'all on a break?

05:17.667 --> 05:18.291
And?

05:18.291 --> 05:20.125
We already filmed the video.

05:20.125 --> 05:21.875
How is that even gonna go?

05:21.875 --> 05:22.333
You know?

05:22.333 --> 05:23.792
What are you gonna say?

05:23.792 --> 05:26.500
"Uh, look, Kay, I
know we're on a break,

05:26.500 --> 05:29.084
but I filmed this party
video with a bunch

05:29.084 --> 05:30.375
of drunk hot chicks.

05:30.375 --> 05:33.667
And I'm wondering if
it's OK if I post it."

05:33.667 --> 05:34.709
I'll handle it.

05:34.709 --> 05:36.458
I got Kay wrapped
around my finger.

05:36.458 --> 05:37.209
It's nothing.

05:37.209 --> 05:39.458
Kay, I just filmed this party,
and there was a whole bunch

05:39.458 --> 05:40.417
of girls that were half naked.

05:40.417 --> 05:41.209
There was a lot of drinking.

05:41.209 --> 05:42.667
There was fraternities,
sororities, all these people

05:42.667 --> 05:44.458
there, and everyone
was having a good time.

05:44.458 --> 05:45.001
And I just didn't--

05:45.001 --> 05:45.375
I just--

05:45.375 --> 05:46.917
Jay, it's fine.

05:46.917 --> 05:47.333
It's fine.

05:47.333 --> 05:47.875
Are you sure?

05:47.875 --> 05:49.042
Because it was a wild party.

05:49.042 --> 05:50.167
And you know I
didn't do anything.

05:50.167 --> 05:51.042
I didn't do nothing.

05:51.042 --> 05:52.542
I told them, look, I'm talking
to this girl right now.

05:52.542 --> 05:53.166
I was just there to
work to make money--

05:53.166 --> 05:55.291
Look, whatever it
is, you're single.

05:55.291 --> 05:57.375
You can do whatever you want.

05:57.375 --> 06:00.001
I just didn't want to mess up
anything between us, you know?

06:00.001 --> 06:01.000
Jay, that's sweet of you.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.792
It really is.

06:02.792 --> 06:05.375
But when I said that I
needed a break, I meant it.

06:05.375 --> 06:08.709
I'm trying to find out
who I am as a person.

06:08.709 --> 06:09.250
I'm trying.

06:09.250 --> 06:10.417
I'm trying to have fun.

06:10.417 --> 06:14.000
I'm-- I'm going to these
parties and things, but it's--

06:14.000 --> 06:16.084
I just want to be
here with you, Kay.

06:16.084 --> 06:16.667
Jay, I--

06:16.667 --> 06:19.125
Do you remember that time,
the first time you came over?

06:19.125 --> 06:21.667
Like, we were just hanging
out, watching movies,

06:21.667 --> 06:24.333
eating popcorn like we were
in middle school again?

06:24.333 --> 06:28.000
We were so nervous, just
sitting there, hands shaking.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.834
Kay, I think you need
more toilet paper.

06:33.667 --> 06:35.917
Who's your friend?

06:35.917 --> 06:37.500
Howdy.

06:39.458 --> 06:40.417
Stop!

06:40.417 --> 06:42.001
That's enough!

06:43.917 --> 06:45.875
Would you stop screaming?

06:45.875 --> 06:49.125
Man, shut up!

06:49.125 --> 06:52.126
Get in the room.

06:52.126 --> 06:53.750
We broke up for that?

06:53.750 --> 06:54.917
That's who you put over me?

06:54.917 --> 06:55.542
I don't know.

06:55.542 --> 06:56.126
No.

06:56.126 --> 06:57.084
No, you do know.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.583
No, and I want to
hear it from you.

06:58.583 --> 07:00.084
Not one of your
social media pages

07:00.084 --> 07:02.167
or one of your Insta
model girlfriends--

07:02.167 --> 07:03.709
Fine.

07:03.709 --> 07:05.333
First of all, he was around.

07:05.333 --> 07:06.125
I'm in school--

07:06.125 --> 07:08.959
Let me finish!

07:08.959 --> 07:11.250
First of all, he was around.

07:11.250 --> 07:14.001
Second of all, he
has money to take

07:14.001 --> 07:15.125
me places and show me things.

07:15.125 --> 07:17.458
I want to go places, Jay.

07:17.458 --> 07:18.583
I want to see things.

07:18.583 --> 07:21.209
I want to go places and be seen.

07:21.209 --> 07:23.208
Movies and chill?

07:23.208 --> 07:26.250
It's fun for a little while.

07:26.250 --> 07:32.041
Third, he has a real job,
not some unreachable dream.

07:32.041 --> 07:34.291
So that's all I am to you, huh?

07:34.291 --> 07:35.625
Broke guy with dreams.

07:35.625 --> 07:37.166
It's sweet.

07:37.166 --> 07:39.542
It really is.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.667
We need more people
like you in the world.

07:41.667 --> 07:45.084
But dreams don't
pay the rent, baby.

07:45.084 --> 07:47.084
Did you sleep with him?

07:47.084 --> 07:48.959
Jay.

07:48.959 --> 07:52.126
Did you sleep with him?

07:52.126 --> 07:54.167
I am sorry.

07:54.167 --> 07:54.834
No, you're not.

07:54.834 --> 07:56.834
Because if you're sorry,
you would have told me.

07:56.834 --> 07:57.834
I was going to tell you.

07:57.834 --> 07:58.208
When?

07:58.208 --> 08:00.083
Before or after he was
done taking a shit?

08:11.750 --> 08:13.500
Ohh.

08:13.500 --> 08:16.041
Oh, god!

08:16.041 --> 08:18.375
Bro, you just made me die!

08:18.375 --> 08:22.041
I will burn your house down
with all of your children in it.

08:22.041 --> 08:23.333
And I'll make--

08:23.333 --> 08:24.959
I'll make your dog watch.

08:24.959 --> 08:26.750
And then I'll adopt it.

08:26.750 --> 08:31.375
I'm gonna cut your family up
in nice, delicious squares.

08:31.375 --> 08:36.167
I will cook you into a
beautiful bolognese sauce with--

08:36.167 --> 08:37.958
with some cheese and shit.

08:37.958 --> 08:40.750
And oh, goddamn,
it will be so good.

08:40.750 --> 08:42.958
It'll be so good in my belly!

08:42.958 --> 08:46.208
I'll eat your life force, bitch.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Gordo presents.

09:12.959 --> 09:14.166
Done.

09:14.166 --> 09:17.084
You finished?

09:17.084 --> 09:19.167
Dropped the video.

09:19.167 --> 09:22.084
My boy.

09:22.084 --> 09:23.084
Let's go.

09:28.001 --> 09:30.583
Holy shit, a 72?

09:30.583 --> 09:32.125
We went over this
like two days before.

09:32.125 --> 09:33.083
What happened?

09:33.083 --> 09:33.834
I don't know.

09:33.834 --> 09:35.041
Were you in a bad mood?

09:35.041 --> 09:35.792
No.

09:35.792 --> 09:37.166
Did you try to cheat?

09:37.166 --> 09:38.125
Off of who?

09:38.125 --> 09:40.166
Are you still dating
that squatty douche bag,

09:40.166 --> 09:43.458
third-string running back with
the "my stepdad put cigarettes

09:43.458 --> 09:45.417
out on my arm"
busted pick-up truck?

09:45.417 --> 09:46.750
Wow.

09:46.750 --> 09:49.209
And no, it's not because of him.

09:49.209 --> 09:50.667
Then what happened?

09:50.667 --> 09:52.333
I just don't care anymore.

09:52.333 --> 09:55.166
I already got into the school
I wanted, and I'm exhausted.

09:55.166 --> 09:57.125
You haven't even
taken your SATs yet.

09:57.125 --> 10:00.208
What school would even accept--

10:00.208 --> 10:03.084
you picked a school
without even telling me?

10:03.084 --> 10:05.458
Well, it's in Denver.

10:05.458 --> 10:08.291
You're going all the
way out to Denver?

10:08.291 --> 10:10.625
Because weed is legal?

10:10.625 --> 10:11.000
Wait.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.458
Have you tried week?

10:12.458 --> 10:14.667
That's why I didn't tell you.

10:14.667 --> 10:16.667
No, I haven't.

10:16.667 --> 10:19.250
Potheads are just
cooler people, you know?

10:19.250 --> 10:20.458
Oh my god.

10:20.458 --> 10:23.542
The ones in my school are
nonjudgemental, free-thinking,

10:23.542 --> 10:25.167
and pretty liberal.

10:25.167 --> 10:28.125
Everyone else in my school is
closed-minded, pretentious,

10:28.125 --> 10:29.375
and slightly racist.

10:29.375 --> 10:30.208
You've seen them.

10:30.208 --> 10:31.875
You know, if you'd
have used the word

10:31.875 --> 10:34.375
pretentious on this shit
essay, you might've gotten a B.

10:34.375 --> 10:35.417
Are you even listening?

10:35.417 --> 10:36.042
Yeah, yeah.

10:36.042 --> 10:37.126
All your friends are assholes.

10:37.126 --> 10:37.542
They are.

10:37.542 --> 10:38.167
So what?

10:38.167 --> 10:40.667
That-- that's how you're gonna
decide your place in the world?

10:40.667 --> 10:42.542
That's-- your big decision
comes off of that?

10:42.542 --> 10:44.291
You can't judge the
whole world based off

10:44.291 --> 10:46.084
of your little private school.

10:46.084 --> 10:50.000
What else do I have to
judge the world off of?

10:50.000 --> 10:51.417
Gah!

10:51.417 --> 10:53.126
You know, I wish I
could just give you

10:53.126 --> 10:54.333
everything I know
so you can just

10:54.333 --> 10:55.667
skip past all the bullshit.

10:55.667 --> 10:58.125
What's the fun in that?

10:58.125 --> 11:01.209
I hate you.

11:01.209 --> 11:03.166
Did I tell you
that I was thinking

11:03.166 --> 11:04.959
about joining a sorority?

11:04.959 --> 11:05.917
I quit.

11:05.917 --> 11:08.000
Katie.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Yeah, it's not bad.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.667
You just want to make sure
you don't restate the pro--

11:11.667 --> 11:12.041
the thesis.

11:12.041 --> 11:12.667
You--

11:12.667 --> 11:14.291
Katie, I've been calling you.

11:14.291 --> 11:16.500
Mom, I'm trying to study.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.458
Did you empty the dishwasher?

11:18.458 --> 11:20.542
Oops.

11:20.542 --> 11:23.458
After we knock this out, I'll
make sure she takes care of it.

11:23.458 --> 11:24.542
Thank you.

11:24.542 --> 11:26.166
I'm glad you're in
town this summer.

11:26.166 --> 11:26.792
No problem.

11:26.792 --> 11:28.959
I'm just here because the
volunteer hours look good

11:28.959 --> 11:29.667
on my resume.

11:29.667 --> 11:31.126
Hey.

11:31.126 --> 11:31.500
Pick up.

11:31.500 --> 11:32.001
Pick up.

11:32.001 --> 11:32.417
Pick up.

11:32.417 --> 11:34.209
Jay, what's going on, man?

11:34.209 --> 11:34.667
It's me.

11:34.667 --> 11:36.500
It's DJ Tricky Fresh.

11:36.500 --> 11:37.417
Pull the video.

11:37.417 --> 11:39.042
We got an emergency.

11:39.042 --> 11:39.417
Pull it.

11:39.417 --> 11:40.209
Destroy it.

11:40.209 --> 11:40.834
Delete it.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.125
Whatever you gotta do.

11:42.125 --> 11:43.042
Burn it.

11:43.042 --> 11:45.126
Get back to me as soon as
you can, all right, man?

11:45.126 --> 11:47.667
Pick up your phone.

11:47.667 --> 11:51.917
Dude, 2,500 views
and still climbing.

11:51.917 --> 11:53.209
Oh my g--

11:53.209 --> 11:55.126
This is insane, bro.

11:55.126 --> 11:58.001
I told you that this
would put us on the map.

11:58.001 --> 12:00.166
Plus, if you get a
call, though, from--

12:00.166 --> 12:02.834
from DJ Shitty Chest or
whatever his name is,

12:02.834 --> 12:05.084
don't-- don't worry about it.

12:05.084 --> 12:06.126
I'll handle it.

12:06.126 --> 12:08.166
Oh, relax.

12:08.166 --> 12:10.041
Their faces are blurred.

12:10.041 --> 12:11.166
Everything is fine.

12:11.166 --> 12:11.792
No!

12:11.792 --> 12:13.542
That was a bullshit fix.

12:13.542 --> 12:14.959
The cops busted the event.

12:14.959 --> 12:16.083
They took a few people to jail.

12:16.083 --> 12:16.959
They wrote tickets.

12:16.959 --> 12:18.709
They knew that there
were minors drinking.

12:18.709 --> 12:21.709
They are old enough to
make their own decisions.

12:21.709 --> 12:22.834
So screw 'em.

12:22.834 --> 12:25.001
It doesn't work that way, Cody.

12:25.001 --> 12:27.250
We provided them with alcohol.

12:27.250 --> 12:30.250
That's a class D misdemeanor
with a maximum sentence

12:30.250 --> 12:34.375
of 364 days in jail and
$2 million in fines.

12:34.375 --> 12:37.083
I don't know about you, but
I'm not trying to go to jail

12:37.083 --> 12:39.625
and then have to get
jumped into a gang

12:39.625 --> 12:42.126
that I had to join
to get protection.

12:42.126 --> 12:45.125
And then have to shank some
Mexican to prove my worth.

12:45.125 --> 12:46.417
I ain't even racist.

12:46.417 --> 12:48.001
I love tacos.

12:48.001 --> 12:52.126
Then, one day, when I'm
showering all alone by myself,

12:52.126 --> 12:54.458
I have to get jumped
by the Mexican gang

12:54.458 --> 12:56.041
that the guy I shanked was in.

12:56.041 --> 13:00.625
And then I get passed around
like a Panama Blue City blunt!

13:00.625 --> 13:01.625
What?

13:01.625 --> 13:03.166
Uh, OK.

13:03.166 --> 13:07.291
First, we didn't
provide any of that.

13:07.291 --> 13:09.125
You did.

13:09.125 --> 13:13.167
And second, I think
you watch too much TV.

13:13.167 --> 13:14.209
Listen to the best.

13:14.209 --> 13:16.375
I'm DJ Tricky Fresh.

13:16.375 --> 13:19.542
Pull the damn video.

13:19.542 --> 13:21.041
OK, fine.

13:21.041 --> 13:23.167
Fine.

13:23.167 --> 13:24.042
We'll pull the video.

13:27.375 --> 13:29.001
I don't want to get in trouble.

13:29.001 --> 13:30.291
We're not pulling the video.

13:30.291 --> 13:31.834
What if this shit
falls back on us.

13:31.834 --> 13:35.333
No, they already have the
ringleader, DJ Shitty Chest

13:35.333 --> 13:37.375
or whatever.

13:37.375 --> 13:39.126
And what would they even do?

13:39.126 --> 13:40.875
What would they
even arrest us for?

13:40.875 --> 13:44.084
Plus, the cops have more
important things to handle.

13:44.084 --> 13:46.917
They'll gun down or
whatever it is they do.

13:46.917 --> 13:48.375
Not all cops are bad.

13:48.375 --> 13:51.875
And not all crimes are
worth following up on.

13:51.875 --> 13:54.375
So let's just accept what's
fallen into our laps.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.291
And what's that?

13:56.291 --> 14:00.333
Attention, reputation,
and momentum.

14:00.333 --> 14:04.084
People are already texting
me about our next event.

14:04.084 --> 14:06.291
Too bad we lost
our only contact.

14:06.291 --> 14:08.291
Well, I've been on the
phones all morning.

14:08.291 --> 14:10.417
I found someone
who's interested.

14:13.291 --> 14:17.834
Have you ever heard of the
bar called the Fuzzy Love?

14:17.834 --> 14:18.709
No.

14:18.709 --> 14:21.709
And I'm not working for a
place called the Fuzzy Love.

14:21.709 --> 14:24.458
Ugh.

14:24.458 --> 14:28.417
I'm looking for one video a week
for our Thursday night college

14:28.417 --> 14:29.166
nights.

14:29.166 --> 14:32.042
I really want it to
capture the environment.

14:32.042 --> 14:34.750
Moldy walls and
the smell of piss?

14:34.750 --> 14:36.750
Now, focus on the
girls the most.

14:36.750 --> 14:38.458
You know, girls and drinks.

14:38.458 --> 14:40.291
The younger the
girls, the better.

14:40.291 --> 14:42.125
How much money are you
looking to get rid of?

14:42.125 --> 14:44.000
Well, how much money
are you trying to make?

14:44.000 --> 14:45.167
$300.

14:45.167 --> 14:46.500
Eh, $150.

14:46.500 --> 14:49.959
$275 and we'll throw in
some special effects.

14:49.959 --> 14:51.458
Oh, $200.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.667
Bullshit!

14:52.667 --> 14:53.875
$250.

14:53.875 --> 14:55.166
Look, man, it's
one video a week.

14:55.166 --> 14:56.125
I know you can do that.

14:56.125 --> 14:57.291
I can't do that.

14:57.291 --> 14:58.209
You can't do that?

14:58.209 --> 15:00.250
Can't do it.

15:00.250 --> 15:01.792
Come on, Al.

15:01.792 --> 15:03.667
Al, after all
we've been through.

15:03.667 --> 15:04.166
Come on, buddy.

15:04.166 --> 15:04.792
Come on.

15:04.792 --> 15:05.792
Work with me here, man.

15:05.792 --> 15:07.042
Look-- look, let's be honest.

15:07.042 --> 15:09.333
All cards on the table,
all bullshit aside,

15:09.333 --> 15:11.125
the reason you called
us here is because you

15:11.125 --> 15:15.167
don't want to shell out
$1,000 to some filmmaker who

15:15.167 --> 15:18.458
showed you his production reel
of slo-mo shots of the city

15:18.458 --> 15:20.834
with sad-ass,
sappy music playing

15:20.834 --> 15:23.125
in the background with his
non-accredited film degree

15:23.125 --> 15:27.792
from some local ass college
while he runs his production

15:27.792 --> 15:31.417
company out of his
mother's apartment.

15:31.417 --> 15:34.667
All I'm asking for
is $250 a week.

15:34.667 --> 15:37.959
And we'll have a turnaround
rate of 48 hours.

15:37.959 --> 15:42.083
$225 a video, and I'll play
your videos through our TV

15:42.083 --> 15:44.166
monitors in the club
throughout the week.

15:44.166 --> 15:45.000
Eh?

15:45.000 --> 15:47.083
Eh?

15:47.083 --> 15:48.167
Deal.

15:49.001 --> 15:49.792
All right!

15:49.792 --> 15:51.125
See you animals next week.

15:51.125 --> 15:54.834
And remember to put as many
girls in the videos as you can.

15:54.834 --> 15:57.458
Girls and drinks.

16:06.084 --> 16:07.458
Shawty acting naughty.

16:07.458 --> 16:09.417
Jello shots off her body.

16:09.417 --> 16:12.375
The life of the party.

16:12.375 --> 16:16.333
I'm the life of the party.

16:16.333 --> 16:18.959
Life of the party.

16:18.959 --> 16:23.333
I'm the life of the party.

16:23.333 --> 16:23.959
Go nuts!

16:26.208 --> 16:27.417
You guys enjoying the party?

16:27.417 --> 16:28.042
Yeah!

16:28.042 --> 16:28.417
Yes!

16:28.417 --> 16:29.333
It's awesome!

16:29.333 --> 16:30.625
It's awesome.

16:30.625 --> 16:31.875
You guys come out here a lot?

16:31.875 --> 16:33.126
Yeah, all the time.

16:33.126 --> 16:33.542
All the time.

16:33.542 --> 16:34.667
Every Thursday night.

16:34.667 --> 16:37.042
Jello wrestling is
going down tonight.

16:37.042 --> 16:38.375
I hope you guys
are ready for this.

16:38.375 --> 16:40.583
I want to see somebody
get slammed, personally.

16:40.583 --> 16:41.250
I can't wait.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.417
It's going down.

16:44.333 --> 16:47.208
Taking shots of Ciroc
all around the clock.

16:47.208 --> 16:50.166
A party ain't a party unless
my people in the spot.

16:50.166 --> 16:52.750
Nigga power.

16:52.750 --> 16:55.709
Nigga power.

16:55.709 --> 16:57.083
Money falling from the ceiling.

17:16.500 --> 17:19.416
Dude, don't you see how everyone
looks at us with that thing?

17:19.416 --> 17:21.541
It makes us look like amateurs.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.001
We are amateurs.

17:23.001 --> 17:24.916
Yeah, but everybody
doesn't need to know that.

17:24.916 --> 17:26.083
That thing sucks.

17:26.083 --> 17:27.083
Watch it.

17:27.083 --> 17:30.001
And don't talk about
Judith like that.

17:30.001 --> 17:30.709
Judith?

17:30.709 --> 17:31.291
Really?

17:31.291 --> 17:33.167
Yeah, it fits.

17:33.167 --> 17:34.250
That's the problem.

17:34.250 --> 17:36.333
We need a camera that
says something like--

17:36.333 --> 17:38.041
like Leonidas or something.

17:38.041 --> 17:39.042
Yeah.

17:39.042 --> 17:41.583
Or Apocalypse.

17:41.583 --> 17:42.291
Exactly.

17:42.291 --> 17:43.875
That way, we can
have more clients--

17:43.875 --> 17:44.709
Or the Leviathan.

17:44.709 --> 17:45.709
Yeah, that's perfect.

17:45.709 --> 17:46.125
So we--

17:46.125 --> 17:48.834
Or Mephistopheles.

17:48.834 --> 17:50.375
Cody!

17:50.375 --> 17:51.500
Sorry.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.250
I smoked a little bit
right before we left.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.209
We need the camera to be able
to do more of this and less

18:01.209 --> 18:01.750
of this.

18:01.750 --> 18:02.792
Ow.

18:02.792 --> 18:03.709
OK.

18:03.709 --> 18:05.959
We have more shutter
options, more light exposure,

18:05.959 --> 18:07.166
lower aperture settings.

18:07.166 --> 18:08.209
OK, fine.

18:08.209 --> 18:08.917
Let's get that.

18:08.917 --> 18:10.458
But can we do it tomorrow?

18:10.458 --> 18:13.250
I got a chick that
needs my attention.

18:20.167 --> 18:22.417
Yeah.

18:22.417 --> 18:26.625
Ones, 10s, 20s, 50s, 100s.

18:26.625 --> 18:28.000
Yeah.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.542
Baby girl-- if you got some K,
then you better make it shake.

18:31.542 --> 18:35.084
If you-- if you got some K,
then you better make it shake.

18:35.084 --> 18:38.959
Hey, if you got some K, then
you better make it shake.

18:38.959 --> 18:42.834
Little money in the bank bout
to make me break the bank.

18:42.834 --> 18:46.042
If you got some K, then
you better make it shake.

18:46.042 --> 18:49.583
If you-- if you got some K,
then you better make it shake.

18:49.583 --> 18:50.500
Hey.

18:53.542 --> 18:55.208
Stop being a little bitch.

18:55.208 --> 18:56.709
Texas standoff.

18:56.709 --> 18:58.166
Uh, what's that?

18:58.166 --> 19:03.041
First person who takes three
shots and chugs a beer wins.

19:03.041 --> 19:05.750
And all you have to
say is "Texas standoff"

19:05.750 --> 19:07.709
to initiate the duel.

19:07.709 --> 19:09.375
That's ridiculous.

19:09.375 --> 19:10.333
Hm.

19:10.333 --> 19:13.042
Is the stripper scared?

19:13.042 --> 19:15.959
Uh, first of all, I
am a go-go dancer.

19:15.959 --> 19:17.250
Second of all, which is not--

19:17.250 --> 19:18.625
A go-go dancer?

19:18.625 --> 19:19.875
You know those girls inside?

19:19.875 --> 19:20.458
Uh-huh.

19:20.458 --> 19:23.250
They get all dressed up,
and they go to the club,

19:23.250 --> 19:25.250
and they dance for free?

19:25.250 --> 19:27.084
I get paid to do it.

19:27.084 --> 19:27.750
Damn.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.500
I basically get paid
to work out at a club.

19:32.083 --> 19:33.291
I got an idea.

19:33.291 --> 19:33.917
Huh?

19:33.917 --> 19:35.625
Mhm.

19:35.625 --> 19:42.208
Whoever wins-- whoever
loses, I mean--

19:42.208 --> 19:46.084
whoever loses has to strip
down to their underwear,

19:46.084 --> 19:48.291
run around the
pool, and jump in.

19:51.792 --> 19:52.166
Deal?

19:55.709 --> 19:57.000
Deal.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.001
Texas standoff.

19:58.001 --> 19:59.125
Texas standoff.

20:04.209 --> 20:08.500
You sold out, chasing money
anywhere, any time of day.

20:08.500 --> 20:11.417
Blood on your hands
in the mirror--

20:11.417 --> 20:13.001
No way.

20:13.001 --> 20:15.917
Take it off.

20:15.917 --> 20:17.250
Take it off.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.834
Take it off.

20:18.834 --> 20:20.375
Take it off.

20:24.542 --> 20:26.209
Enjoy.

20:30.375 --> 20:34.167
If you got some K, then
you better make it shake.

20:34.167 --> 20:37.625
If you-- if you got some K,
then you better make it shake.

20:37.625 --> 20:41.458
Hey, if you got some K, then
you better make it shake.

20:41.458 --> 20:44.042
Little money in the
bank bout to make--

21:08.417 --> 21:11.084
Hey, yo, check this out.

21:11.084 --> 21:13.291
Brand new camera just came in.

21:13.291 --> 21:15.001
Oh, hell yeah.

21:15.001 --> 21:17.126
Does that have the low
light shit that you wanted?

21:17.126 --> 21:18.583
Game changer.

21:18.583 --> 21:19.875
Did you get Al's voicemail?

21:19.875 --> 21:20.250
Yeah, man.

21:20.250 --> 21:22.167
I don't know what the
hell we're gonna do.

21:22.167 --> 21:24.167
You need to trust me more.

21:24.167 --> 21:27.583
I told you I can handle
lining up potential clients.

21:27.583 --> 21:30.333
Plus, we knew he wasn't gonna
need our videos forever.

21:30.333 --> 21:33.000
And he's still gonna play them.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.166
I have someone that we can
sit down with, you know.

21:35.166 --> 21:37.125
And we should sit
down with them.

21:37.125 --> 21:40.291
Plus, it's summer, so there's
still plenty of options.

21:40.291 --> 21:43.542
My team and I saw
your little videos.

21:43.542 --> 21:45.917
They're cute.

21:45.917 --> 21:49.291
But I think if you
work for us, we

21:49.291 --> 21:51.042
can take you guys
to the next level.

21:51.042 --> 21:53.500
Yeah, we saw your little
promotional videos.

21:53.500 --> 21:56.375
We can upgrade that
shaky cell phone quality.

21:56.375 --> 21:57.667
What's your guys' name?

21:57.667 --> 22:00.126
Party Hype Film Krew.

22:00.126 --> 22:01.834
Party Hype Film Krew?

22:01.834 --> 22:03.001
That's a mouthful.

22:03.001 --> 22:03.375
Wait.

22:03.375 --> 22:03.542
Wait.

22:03.542 --> 22:04.167
Wait.

22:04.167 --> 22:04.709
Let me guess.

22:04.709 --> 22:08.834
The two of you spell
"crew" with a K.

22:11.209 --> 22:11.792
OK.

22:11.792 --> 22:12.042
Wait.

22:12.042 --> 22:13.126
Let me get this straight.

22:13.126 --> 22:14.792
A local club promoter
is telling us

22:14.792 --> 22:16.834
how to be more marketable
to a larger audience?

22:16.834 --> 22:19.001
We don't just promote clubs.

22:19.001 --> 22:22.208
Squad X dominates the scene.

22:22.208 --> 22:25.084
We monopolize the game, baby.

22:25.084 --> 22:29.001
I got club promoters
on every single campus

22:29.001 --> 22:32.084
surrounding downtown.

22:32.084 --> 22:34.417
We send party buses
out, and they bring them

22:34.417 --> 22:35.583
back to the club.

22:35.583 --> 22:40.084
Now, if the two of you could put
your egos aside for a second,

22:40.084 --> 22:42.625
you'd be smart enough to
see the sweet deal I'm

22:42.625 --> 22:44.083
about to offer you.

22:44.083 --> 22:45.625
All right, all right.

22:45.625 --> 22:47.250
How much money we talking?

22:47.250 --> 22:49.209
I don't know.

22:49.209 --> 22:51.126
I'm talking to a couple
of other film crews,

22:51.126 --> 22:54.126
so why don't we say $125?

22:54.126 --> 22:55.667
Hoo.

22:55.667 --> 22:58.126
Yeah, I was thinking more in
the ballpark of about $300.

22:58.126 --> 23:00.667
Yeah, we got a brand new camera,
some new equipment, and that

23:00.667 --> 23:01.917
covers editing as well.

23:06.166 --> 23:09.375
You think this is a negotiation?

23:09.375 --> 23:13.834
$125.

23:13.834 --> 23:16.792
Think of it as a trial run.

23:19.500 --> 23:22.500
Shawty hit my line, but
my phone ain't never ring.

23:22.500 --> 23:24.166
A goddamn trail run?

23:24.166 --> 23:25.542
No, screw that shit, man.

23:25.542 --> 23:26.417
Relax, man.

23:26.417 --> 23:27.250
What's your deal?

23:27.250 --> 23:29.000
They're talking
about camera crews.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.375
What camera crews?

23:30.375 --> 23:31.792
We are the camera crew.

23:31.792 --> 23:33.875
Relax, dude.

23:33.875 --> 23:36.126
What, do you want to work
for an egotistical maniac?

23:36.126 --> 23:37.709
I'm already working for one.

23:37.709 --> 23:39.208
Whatever, man.

23:39.208 --> 23:40.500
Listen.

23:40.500 --> 23:42.500
Listen!

23:42.500 --> 23:45.125
Let's just kill the
video like we always do.

23:45.125 --> 23:47.000
We'll get in with this crew.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.208
We'll get paid to make
videos every week.

23:50.208 --> 23:52.583
And they promote
two clubs each week.

23:52.583 --> 23:54.126
That's more money for us.

23:54.126 --> 23:55.250
Yeah, if they decide to pay us.

23:55.250 --> 23:57.126
He'll pay.

23:57.126 --> 23:59.917
They just have to break
us in a little bit.

23:59.917 --> 24:01.084
What are we, dogs?

24:01.084 --> 24:04.042
Just play the game
for a little bit.

24:04.042 --> 24:07.583
Like you said, just
use them until we find

24:07.583 --> 24:08.792
the next step in the ladder.

24:13.250 --> 24:16.126
You're right.

24:16.126 --> 24:18.084
You're right.

24:18.084 --> 24:22.834
Plus, it'll be fun as shit.

24:22.834 --> 24:27.792
Nightclubs, chicks, drinks.

24:27.792 --> 24:28.417
We're moving up.

24:35.583 --> 24:40.166
So close,
but so far away.

24:40.166 --> 24:44.583
I'm running out of reasons
to ask you to stay.

24:44.583 --> 24:48.167
Your mind changes
like the seasons,

24:48.167 --> 24:52.208
leaving me out in the
cold, feeling so--

24:52.208 --> 24:54.083
feeling so alone.

24:54.083 --> 25:01.083
I'm waiting for you
to come around again.

25:01.083 --> 25:03.709
I can't wait forever.

25:03.709 --> 25:06.041
I'm waiting.

25:06.041 --> 25:10.000
I want you so bad.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.209
But I can't wait forever.

25:19.500 --> 25:21.500
I can't wait forever.

25:38.917 --> 25:39.917
Gordo presents.

25:54.500 --> 25:56.167
Look, man, you don't
get to just make

25:56.167 --> 25:57.959
extreme decisions like that.

25:57.959 --> 25:59.542
Extreme decisions?

25:59.542 --> 26:02.542
I know that filming is easy
for you and all nonchalant.

26:02.542 --> 26:06.834
But marketing is a
serious business.

26:06.834 --> 26:09.875
The look of our company
matters on every single piece

26:09.875 --> 26:11.625
of content that we put out.

26:11.625 --> 26:12.166
Oh, I'm sorry.

26:12.166 --> 26:13.583
What part of this
video misrepresents

26:13.583 --> 26:14.792
what you do for a living?

26:14.792 --> 26:16.375
It's not just that.

26:16.375 --> 26:18.291
Our team has an order.

26:18.291 --> 26:21.834
There's a structure, a chain of
command, checks and balances.

26:21.834 --> 26:24.042
Dude, it's a video
about partying.

26:24.042 --> 26:24.709
That's it.

26:24.709 --> 26:25.458
Relax.

26:25.458 --> 26:28.875
Look, you film the video.

26:28.875 --> 26:29.875
You edit it.

26:29.875 --> 26:31.042
You send it to me.

26:31.042 --> 26:34.167
I'll watch it, and then
I'll check off on it.

26:34.167 --> 26:36.792
I get to decide when
we post the video.

26:36.792 --> 26:38.959
You don't get to post
whatever you want.

26:38.959 --> 26:41.167
Dude, have you
seen social media?

26:41.167 --> 26:42.083
Everyone loves it.

26:42.083 --> 26:44.167
You're the only one
that's bitching about it.

26:44.167 --> 26:47.125
Then I'm the only one
that runs this business.

26:47.125 --> 26:49.500
You got a problem with that?

26:49.500 --> 26:55.041
Why don't you go back to filming
some run-down, shitty-ass bar?

26:55.041 --> 26:56.167
Look, hold on.

26:56.167 --> 26:56.542
Wait.

26:56.542 --> 26:57.583
Just wait.

26:57.583 --> 26:59.000
This is stupid.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.583
I don't want to argue, and
I don't want to yell at you.

27:02.583 --> 27:07.750
Look, dropping a video is
all about key timing, OK?

27:07.750 --> 27:10.084
What if we have an
event coming up?

27:10.084 --> 27:11.291
We've got to hype that up.

27:11.291 --> 27:14.041
We've got to
capitalize on a post.

27:14.041 --> 27:18.000
It's all about the timing, OK?

27:18.000 --> 27:21.667
Let's just pull the video
down, and we'll fix it.

27:21.667 --> 27:22.250
I mean, come on.

27:22.250 --> 27:24.250
There's some pacing
issues in that video.

27:24.250 --> 27:26.000
Some of the shots
are a little slow,

27:26.000 --> 27:29.417
and I need that to be fast.

27:29.417 --> 27:31.084
Let's work on it together.

27:31.084 --> 27:34.333
We can fix it, put it back up,
and then on the next video,

27:34.333 --> 27:37.834
we can work on it together
and knock that out.

27:37.834 --> 27:39.000
Come on, man.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.500
Let's get back to work
and have some fun.

27:52.792 --> 27:54.250
Party Hype Film Krew.

27:54.250 --> 27:55.875
This is how we party, bro.

28:28.625 --> 28:32.001
It's the same shit every
single time we go out.

28:32.001 --> 28:33.041
Do you realize that?

28:33.041 --> 28:34.583
It's called being nice, OK?

28:34.583 --> 28:37.166
Not everyone's an angry,
stone-faced asshole.

28:37.166 --> 28:38.084
Nice?

28:38.084 --> 28:39.250
Is that what you call it?

28:39.250 --> 28:41.041
Complaining about
your life to every guy

28:41.041 --> 28:43.084
you see like it's so bad.

28:43.084 --> 28:44.083
You go to a PWI.

28:44.083 --> 28:46.417
And you're basically the
queen of your little sorority.

28:46.417 --> 28:47.083
Really?

28:47.083 --> 28:48.750
Who are you to judge me?

28:48.750 --> 28:50.084
Screw you.

28:50.084 --> 28:54.083
Oh, yeah, and laughing at every
guy's joke like it's so funny.

28:54.083 --> 28:56.125
"Ha, ha, that's what she said.

28:56.125 --> 28:57.125
Good one, Chad."

28:57.125 --> 29:00.667
Don't blame me for your
own insecurities, OK?

29:00.667 --> 29:02.375
Insecurities?

29:02.375 --> 29:04.083
I call it being aware.

29:04.083 --> 29:08.375
Mean mugging every guy I
introduce you to is insecure.

29:08.375 --> 29:11.250
Getting angry at me for
not posting pictures of us

29:11.250 --> 29:12.875
on my social media?

29:12.875 --> 29:13.709
That's insecure.

29:13.709 --> 29:17.084
Hitting up my ex, asking
him why we broke up?

29:17.084 --> 29:18.709
That is so insecure.

29:18.709 --> 29:20.250
Yeah, well, maybe if
I could trust you,

29:20.250 --> 29:22.709
I wouldn't have to do
shit like that, you know?

29:22.709 --> 29:26.000
Because you entertain every
single guy you come across,

29:26.000 --> 29:29.209
showing me stupid shit on
your phone like, "Hey, babe,

29:29.209 --> 29:31.084
look at this picture
this guy sent me.

29:31.084 --> 29:33.084
Oh my god, he won't
stop texting me."

29:33.084 --> 29:35.083
How did he get your
number in the first place?

29:35.083 --> 29:37.000
That's the type of shit
that I'm talking about.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.209
You're the one to
talk, you know.

29:38.209 --> 29:40.167
You have girls hanging
off you all the time.

29:40.167 --> 29:41.001
And I push them off!

29:41.001 --> 29:42.542
What about Lauren?

29:42.542 --> 29:44.500
Hitting you up at
2:00 in the morning?

29:44.500 --> 29:45.792
What is that about?

29:45.792 --> 29:48.208
What in the world gave
her the confidence

29:48.208 --> 29:50.375
to call you at 2:00
in the morning?

29:50.375 --> 29:52.042
I explained that.

29:52.042 --> 29:54.208
You can't even explain the
short, little midget frat

29:54.208 --> 29:55.167
guy we saw tonight.

29:55.167 --> 29:55.542
Oh god.

29:55.542 --> 29:56.667
I'm an extrovert, OK?

29:56.667 --> 29:58.291
I'm a free spirit.

29:58.291 --> 29:59.375
And you know what?

29:59.375 --> 30:01.458
That was what you said
you used to love about me.

30:01.458 --> 30:03.001
Yeah, well, maybe
I made a mistake.

30:05.625 --> 30:06.583
A mistake?

30:09.750 --> 30:10.542
Yeah, you know what?

30:10.542 --> 30:11.458
I made a mistake, too.

30:11.458 --> 30:14.084
I kissed my ex while you were
looking for me in the bathroom.

30:14.084 --> 30:14.750
And you want to know what?

30:14.750 --> 30:15.792
Maybe it was the
best thing that's

30:15.792 --> 30:17.000
happened to me in
the past month.

30:20.084 --> 30:20.750
Whoa, wait.

30:20.750 --> 30:21.709
Bella, sweetie, wait.

30:21.709 --> 30:22.083
Hold on.

30:22.083 --> 30:22.458
You're too drunk to drive.

30:22.458 --> 30:23.208
Bella, come back.

30:23.208 --> 30:23.834
Bella!

30:23.834 --> 30:26.458
He didn't mean it.

30:26.458 --> 30:28.375
God.

30:28.375 --> 30:30.042
Jay, are you gonna do something?

30:30.042 --> 30:31.125
She's too drunk to drive.

30:33.542 --> 30:34.167
Jay.

30:36.542 --> 30:37.167
Jay!

30:40.167 --> 30:40.917
I hope she crashes.

30:43.333 --> 30:44.542
Whoa, Mickey, Mickey.

30:44.542 --> 30:45.167
Mickey.

30:45.167 --> 30:46.458
Mickey, take it easy.

30:46.458 --> 30:47.375
Let the fuck go of me!

30:47.375 --> 30:48.500
We'll go find her.

30:48.500 --> 30:49.333
Let me go.

30:49.333 --> 30:50.000
Trust me.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.125
Just walk it off.

30:51.125 --> 30:51.750
Geez.

30:54.709 --> 30:55.667
Fucking prick.

30:58.625 --> 31:00.083
Friends with benefits.

31:05.126 --> 31:05.500
Yeah.

31:05.500 --> 31:10.750
When did we get so
territorial and serious?

31:10.750 --> 31:11.667
I'm sorry.

31:11.667 --> 31:12.542
I don't know.

31:12.542 --> 31:13.167
I'm sorry.

31:13.167 --> 31:15.291
I'm sorry.

31:15.291 --> 31:17.709
I'm sorry.

31:17.709 --> 31:18.417
He was my first.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
So we have a crazy history.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.209
And--

31:25.209 --> 31:25.792
It's cool.

31:25.792 --> 31:29.167
But I meant what I said
when I said that, you know,

31:29.167 --> 31:33.000
we just hook up until we
find somebody we really

31:33.000 --> 31:33.834
want to be with.

31:33.834 --> 31:35.417
And, um--

31:35.417 --> 31:40.834
It sounds, like, so easy
to do, but I don't know.

31:40.834 --> 31:43.001
I think it's inevitable
to get jealous

31:43.001 --> 31:49.208
when you're sharing your
body with someone so often.

31:49.208 --> 31:51.542
You got jealous?

31:51.542 --> 31:57.167
I saw you on the dance floor
with that big-tittied cocktail

31:57.167 --> 32:01.166
waitress, and I wanted to
rip out her fake extensions.

32:02.125 --> 32:03.625
Ouch.

32:03.625 --> 32:07.084
I can't believe I
was feeling that way.

32:07.084 --> 32:12.959
I think, um, we should
just be friends.

32:12.959 --> 32:14.167
Yeah.

32:14.167 --> 32:15.125
Sounds good.

32:15.125 --> 32:16.959
It was fun, though.

32:16.959 --> 32:17.792
Yeah.

32:17.792 --> 32:18.375
Yeah, it was.

32:21.167 --> 32:23.167
I guess I'll, um--

32:23.167 --> 32:24.125
I guess I'll see you around.

33:23.333 --> 33:23.917
Bitch.

33:50.125 --> 33:51.208
Check this crowd out.

33:54.291 --> 33:55.709
The line goes down the street.

33:55.709 --> 33:56.417
Look at over here.

34:00.083 --> 34:01.875
It's the party bomb.

34:01.875 --> 34:03.084
It's all over the place.

34:03.084 --> 34:03.834
I love it.

34:03.834 --> 34:04.208
I love it.

34:04.208 --> 34:05.834
Ladies all over the place, man.

34:05.834 --> 34:09.166
I know everybody's gonna
have a blast tonight.

34:09.166 --> 34:09.792
Shit!

34:09.792 --> 34:12.583
If this damn thing
would just go!

34:12.583 --> 34:13.625
Jay?

34:13.625 --> 34:15.291
What?

34:15.291 --> 34:16.167
I'm sorry?

34:16.167 --> 34:16.542
I'm sorry.

34:16.542 --> 34:17.625
Um, I just put the camera up.

34:17.625 --> 34:19.875
The photos and videos will
be online later this week.

34:19.875 --> 34:20.625
Thank you.

34:20.625 --> 34:22.667
How many times do you have
to say that per night?

34:22.667 --> 34:25.208
A lot.

34:25.208 --> 34:27.875
Jay, it's me, Dani.

34:27.875 --> 34:29.625
That crazy jello
wrestling night,

34:29.625 --> 34:31.542
you interviewed me and
some of my friends.

34:31.542 --> 34:32.167
I'm sorry.

34:32.167 --> 34:34.083
This is really embarrassing.

34:34.083 --> 34:35.083
It's been a rough night.

34:35.083 --> 34:36.667
But, um, how have you been?

34:36.667 --> 34:37.125
I'm sorry.

34:37.125 --> 34:37.750
I'm sorry.

34:37.750 --> 34:39.875
It's fine.

34:39.875 --> 34:41.000
Good, good.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.083
I'm just enjoying my
summer before my school

34:43.083 --> 34:44.500
stuff starts back up.

34:44.500 --> 34:45.875
Ooh, don't remind me.

34:45.875 --> 34:46.583
Yeah.

34:46.583 --> 34:49.126
And school was like hell
for me last semester.

34:49.126 --> 34:51.041
So I changed my major
from health sciences

34:51.041 --> 34:52.792
to biomedical engineering.

34:52.792 --> 34:53.917
Holy shit.

34:53.917 --> 34:56.083
I mean, naturally, that's
such a smooth transition.

34:56.083 --> 34:56.417
I know.

34:56.417 --> 34:58.000
I mean, I can see how
that goes so well.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.126
No, it's just-- it's
more fun for me.

35:00.126 --> 35:02.001
And then my family and
I, like, this weekend

35:02.001 --> 35:06.083
are gonna take our annual
family vacation thing to Aspen.

35:06.083 --> 35:06.834
So.

35:06.834 --> 35:07.750
You're going to Aspen?

35:07.750 --> 35:09.126
Yeah, have you been?

35:09.126 --> 35:09.500
No.

35:09.500 --> 35:10.959
No, I've-- I haven't left Texas.

35:10.959 --> 35:11.500
Well, wait, no.

35:11.500 --> 35:14.084
There was this one time me and
my friends got really wasted

35:14.084 --> 35:16.208
and we went to that
casino out in Oklahoma.

35:16.208 --> 35:18.709
But I mean-- I mean, I guess
Aspen, that's cool, too.

35:18.709 --> 35:20.667
Yeah, but we should
party when I get back.

35:20.667 --> 35:21.208
Yeah.

35:21.208 --> 35:22.042
Yeah.

35:22.042 --> 35:26.126
What's-- what's, um--
what's your cell?

35:26.126 --> 35:28.042
OK, 214--

35:28.042 --> 35:28.542
214--

35:28.542 --> 35:31.542
Honestly, it's probably
easier if I just--

35:31.542 --> 35:32.458
Yeah, yeah.

35:35.834 --> 35:36.417
OK, wait.

35:36.417 --> 35:37.208
Let's take a selfie.

35:37.208 --> 35:38.125
Yeah, sure.

35:43.875 --> 35:44.250
Wait.

35:44.250 --> 35:46.083
I meant-- can I take another
one in case I look ugly?

35:46.083 --> 35:47.333
Oh my god, you don't look ugly.

35:47.333 --> 35:48.001
No, stop.

35:48.001 --> 35:48.250
I have to.

35:48.250 --> 35:48.875
OK.

35:54.291 --> 35:57.583
#AngryVideoGuy.

35:57.583 --> 35:58.625
#You'veComeALongWay.

35:58.625 --> 36:00.458
Don't worry about it.

36:00.458 --> 36:01.417
Damn.

36:01.417 --> 36:03.792
Your job is to
keep track of them.

36:03.792 --> 36:05.458
Look, I'm not gonna
tell black people

36:05.458 --> 36:07.041
they can't come to the club.

36:07.041 --> 36:08.208
That's not what I'm saying.

36:08.208 --> 36:10.625
That's basically what
you're saying, right?

36:10.625 --> 36:13.084
Look, if you don't want black
people to come to the club,

36:13.084 --> 36:15.001
junk crank up the dress code.

36:15.001 --> 36:18.166
Stop letting them wear big
shirts and basketball shoes.

36:18.166 --> 36:19.542
That's the bodyguard's job.

36:19.542 --> 36:20.834
Tell them to do a better job.

36:20.834 --> 36:22.208
That's your job.

36:22.208 --> 36:23.959
I saw the groups you brought in.

36:23.959 --> 36:27.542
If too many of them get in, it
changes the vibe of the club.

36:27.542 --> 36:28.917
They start fights.

36:28.917 --> 36:30.500
People are afraid to come here.

36:30.500 --> 36:31.291
And we lose money.

36:31.291 --> 36:33.167
You lose money.

36:33.167 --> 36:35.000
Perception is reality.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.208
We need to maintain an
upscale environment.

36:37.208 --> 36:40.291
By upscale, do you mean
these insecure white girls

36:40.291 --> 36:41.583
with big, fake titties?

36:41.583 --> 36:43.417
Or they're rich-ass
sugar daddies who

36:43.417 --> 36:44.625
are cheating on their wives?

36:44.625 --> 36:46.792
This is not a joke.

36:46.792 --> 36:48.875
I will not lose another
club because of them.

36:48.875 --> 36:51.208
I will happily get rid
of your little squad

36:51.208 --> 36:52.959
long before I let that happen.

36:52.959 --> 36:54.750
You probably lost your
last club because you

36:54.750 --> 36:56.458
don't know how the world works.

36:56.458 --> 37:00.750
Those fake white girls with
fake titties have fathers--

37:00.750 --> 37:02.917
fathers who made their
fortunes on the backs

37:02.917 --> 37:06.834
of my mother and father, who
were paid just enough for us

37:06.834 --> 37:09.042
to still starve.

37:09.042 --> 37:10.333
Those are the bank
accounts I want

37:10.333 --> 37:13.625
to bleed dry every night,
as I sell their entitled

37:13.625 --> 37:18.291
sons and daughters
fermented, overpriced poison.

37:18.291 --> 37:19.917
Things are never
black or white, GO.

37:19.917 --> 37:22.126
I'm not a racist.

37:22.126 --> 37:24.042
I'm a capitalist.

37:24.042 --> 37:25.250
You know what?

37:25.250 --> 37:28.084
I'm gonna save you the trouble.

37:28.084 --> 37:29.917
I quit.

37:29.917 --> 37:33.166
My team ain't working for
no racist, prejudiced piece

37:33.166 --> 37:36.209
of shit like you.

37:36.209 --> 37:36.583
Good luck.

37:40.291 --> 37:41.875
Oh, what now?

37:41.875 --> 37:42.917
We haven't been paid yet.

37:42.917 --> 37:44.208
You can get the
pre-game tomorrow.

37:44.208 --> 37:46.959
We gotta count it
first and pay our guys.

37:46.959 --> 37:47.875
How is that my problem?

37:47.875 --> 37:48.875
Get out of my way.

37:53.750 --> 37:54.709
I'm working.

37:59.625 --> 38:02.041
I'm sorry.

38:02.041 --> 38:03.417
Wait.

38:03.417 --> 38:05.959
Are you the videographer?

38:05.959 --> 38:07.291
Yeah.

38:07.291 --> 38:10.167
Awesome work, my friend.

38:10.167 --> 38:11.250
Thanks.

38:11.250 --> 38:12.084
I'm Alex.

38:12.084 --> 38:13.001
I own Club Life.

38:13.001 --> 38:16.250
I'm firing Squad X. So when you
want to cut out the middleman,

38:16.250 --> 38:17.209
give me a call.

38:17.209 --> 38:19.542
I'll double whatever
he's paying you.

38:19.542 --> 38:21.083
Matter of fact, can
you send me a copy

38:21.083 --> 38:22.625
of the video you made tonight?

38:22.625 --> 38:23.125
Yeah.

38:23.125 --> 38:24.001
Ye-- yeah.

38:24.001 --> 38:25.167
Don't change anything.

38:25.167 --> 38:26.875
Make it exactly how
you usually would.

38:26.875 --> 38:28.126
Bring that magic.

38:28.126 --> 38:28.500
Yeah.

38:28.500 --> 38:30.167
Yeah, man, totally.

38:30.167 --> 38:31.417
When will it be ready?

38:31.417 --> 38:32.542
48.

38:32.542 --> 38:33.959
48 hours, max.

38:33.959 --> 38:34.959
You work quick.

38:34.959 --> 38:35.834
I love it.

38:35.834 --> 38:36.709
We'll talk soon.

38:36.709 --> 38:37.291
Yeah.

38:37.291 --> 38:38.583
Yeah.

38:38.583 --> 38:39.209
Thank you.

38:39.209 --> 38:39.583
Thank you.

38:51.750 --> 38:52.417
Gordo presents.

39:17.709 --> 39:20.166
Uh-oh.

39:20.166 --> 39:21.792
Is this guy bothering you?

39:21.792 --> 39:22.667
No, he's just--

39:22.667 --> 39:24.126
No, don't worry, babe.

39:24.126 --> 39:26.125
I'll handle it.

39:26.125 --> 39:27.959
Wait.

39:27.959 --> 39:31.458
Hey, look, asshole, I don't know
who you are, but-- oh my god!

39:31.458 --> 39:32.333
Please don't hurt me!

39:32.333 --> 39:34.083
Take my wallet!

39:34.083 --> 39:35.667
I don't want your money.

39:35.667 --> 39:37.041
Please don't hurt me.

39:37.041 --> 39:38.041
I love you people.

39:38.041 --> 39:39.083
Black lives matter.

39:39.083 --> 39:40.041
I voted for Obama.

39:40.041 --> 39:41.458
Basketball is my favorite sport.

39:41.458 --> 39:44.166
I-- please.

39:44.166 --> 39:44.792
Ah!

39:47.417 --> 39:50.083
I'm gonna call my dad,
and he's gonna sue you.

39:53.458 --> 39:56.333
What kind of guy wears shorts
that don't pass his knees?

39:56.333 --> 40:00.959
I'm old enough to date
whoever I want, you know.

40:00.959 --> 40:02.083
How did you find me?

40:02.083 --> 40:03.083
I'm not here about that.

40:03.083 --> 40:04.750
Your mom told me where you were.

40:04.750 --> 40:05.250
What's wrong?

40:09.083 --> 40:10.041
Oh.

40:10.041 --> 40:11.084
Yeah.

40:11.084 --> 40:12.458
You didn't tell her, did you?

40:12.458 --> 40:13.333
No, I didn't tell her.

40:13.333 --> 40:14.917
She's got real shit
to worry about.

40:14.917 --> 40:16.834
And I'm not a snitch.

40:16.834 --> 40:17.834
Look, don't smile at me.

40:17.834 --> 40:19.625
What the hell were
you doing at a club?

40:19.625 --> 40:22.209
Celebrating my 18th birthday.

40:22.209 --> 40:23.583
Thanks for remembering,
by the way.

40:23.583 --> 40:24.417
I've seen your friends.

40:24.417 --> 40:26.209
There's no way in
hell they're over 17.

40:26.209 --> 40:27.166
How the hell did you get in?

40:27.166 --> 40:28.083
We sent Tony a fake.

40:29.084 --> 40:30.000
Oh my god, you're so young.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.875
You know what kind of
people go to clubs?

40:31.875 --> 40:34.084
Look, people looking to
hook up with people, OK?

40:34.084 --> 40:36.125
They're looking to take
advantage of whoever is there,

40:36.125 --> 40:39.084
especially young girls that
have no business being there,

40:39.084 --> 40:41.125
who are probably actually
underage in the first place,

40:41.125 --> 40:41.792
all right?

40:41.792 --> 40:44.041
They're looking to take them
to go do things and go places

40:44.041 --> 40:45.500
that you wouldn't normally go!

40:45.500 --> 40:48.917
And some people, like my
friends and I, just go to dance.

40:48.917 --> 40:50.834
That's like 8% of the
people that are there.

40:50.834 --> 40:55.041
The other 92% are people
that are savages, animals

40:55.041 --> 40:58.250
looking to hook up with anything
that has a pulse or breathes.

40:58.250 --> 41:01.458
What percentage are you in?

41:01.458 --> 41:02.458
Yeah.

41:02.458 --> 41:04.333
I've seen your videos.

41:04.333 --> 41:06.291
Party Hype Film Krew?

41:06.291 --> 41:09.000
You're lecturing me about
being safe from predators?

41:09.000 --> 41:10.208
Yeah, you would know, right?

41:10.208 --> 41:11.250
That's different.

41:11.250 --> 41:12.291
How?

41:12.291 --> 41:15.084
Hey, you're not gonna make me
feel guilty about this, OK?

41:15.084 --> 41:17.167
You're a kid in high school.

41:17.167 --> 41:18.917
I'm 21 and in college, OK?

41:18.917 --> 41:21.125
That doesn't even make sense.

41:21.125 --> 41:22.667
Whatever.

41:22.667 --> 41:24.291
Just leave me alone.

41:24.291 --> 41:26.250
Handle your own life.

41:26.250 --> 41:27.500
Katie.

41:27.500 --> 41:30.084
Katie!

41:30.084 --> 41:30.458
Shit!

42:01.084 --> 42:03.126
Blue shorts was your
ride home, wasn't he?

42:12.750 --> 42:15.041
I just want to see you get to
your next destination in life

42:15.041 --> 42:15.667
safely.

42:18.001 --> 42:18.375
I know.

42:21.291 --> 42:26.625
Look, just-- I'm sorry for being
involved too much in your life.

42:26.625 --> 42:30.458
And, uh, just call me if
you need anything or want me

42:30.458 --> 42:34.126
to handle anybody.

42:34.126 --> 42:37.166
I always do.

42:37.166 --> 42:40.583
And I didn't mean
what I said earlier.

42:40.583 --> 42:43.126
I know you were
looking out for me.

42:43.126 --> 42:44.667
Thank you.

42:44.667 --> 42:46.834
You're my get out
of jail free card.

42:50.792 --> 42:51.250
Get out.

42:51.250 --> 42:52.333
You ruined it.

42:52.333 --> 42:52.917
Get out.

42:55.709 --> 42:56.083
Later.

43:07.250 --> 43:09.209
--but it's like
2:00 in the morning.

43:09.209 --> 43:11.375
I don't understand why we
can't do this tomorrow.

43:11.375 --> 43:12.041
sleep.

43:12.041 --> 43:12.709
It's respect.

43:12.709 --> 43:13.458
It's about respect.

43:13.458 --> 43:14.458
He's already gone home.

43:14.458 --> 43:16.875
He can't just feel like he
can pay us whenever he wants.

43:16.875 --> 43:17.834
You do this every time.

43:17.834 --> 43:18.583
We're already here.

43:18.583 --> 43:20.542
Why can't we wait
until tomorrow?

43:20.542 --> 43:22.084
Why does it matt-- what?

43:22.084 --> 43:23.458
We could just call him.

43:23.458 --> 43:26.625
We'll figure out
tomorrow if we do--

43:26.625 --> 43:27.000
Hey!

43:27.000 --> 43:30.083
Now, what-- hey, don't
you see I'm busy here?

43:30.083 --> 43:31.458
Look, I'll pay y'all later.

43:31.458 --> 43:33.750
Let me just finish up first.

43:33.750 --> 43:34.125
Hey!

43:34.125 --> 43:34.375
Whoa!

43:34.375 --> 43:34.667
Whoa!

43:34.667 --> 43:35.250
Oh shit!

43:35.250 --> 43:36.500
Oh f--

43:36.500 --> 43:38.083
Oh shit.

43:38.792 --> 43:39.166
Oh!

43:41.041 --> 43:42.167
Oh, bite him.

43:42.167 --> 43:44.041
Bite his ear off.

43:44.041 --> 43:45.000
Hoo!

43:45.000 --> 43:46.042
Ground and pound.

43:46.042 --> 43:46.667
Ground and pound.

43:46.667 --> 43:46.875
Ooh!

43:46.875 --> 43:48.001
Put him in the guillotine!

43:48.001 --> 43:49.167
Put him in the guillotine.

43:49.167 --> 43:50.542
Tap his ass out.

43:59.208 --> 44:00.667
Hear my confession.

44:00.667 --> 44:02.250
Girl, you the source
of my stressin'.

44:02.250 --> 44:03.750
I treat my loss as a lesson.

44:03.750 --> 44:05.126
Could be for nothin'.

44:05.126 --> 44:06.625
You could be out here finessin'.

44:06.625 --> 44:08.166
Instead it's my phone
that you textin'.

44:08.166 --> 44:09.000
Look to the sky.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.291
I thank God for my blessin'.

44:10.291 --> 44:12.625
I act like I'm good on
my own, but I'm flexin'.

44:12.625 --> 44:15.667
Girl, if I could, I would buy
you the world, buy you a crib,

44:15.667 --> 44:18.917
toss the keys to the Jeep.

44:18.917 --> 44:23.208
Sometimes what you need, it
be sittin' in front of you.

44:23.208 --> 44:24.166
Put me to the test.

44:24.166 --> 44:25.792
Going far from your other dudes.

44:25.792 --> 44:26.750
Just need a chance.

44:26.750 --> 44:28.209
That way, I can
get close to you.

44:28.209 --> 44:30.167
Knew it was nothing the
first time I spoke to--

44:30.167 --> 44:31.333
You just gonna play games now?

44:31.333 --> 44:33.042
Dude, it's the playoffs.

44:33.042 --> 44:34.125
Are you-- what are you--

44:34.125 --> 44:36.250
It's game seven right now.

44:36.250 --> 44:38.001
Game seven?

44:38.001 --> 44:40.417
What-- it's like in the
middle of the night right now.

44:40.417 --> 44:42.417
How did you just pick
up and resume a game?

44:42.417 --> 44:44.291
I'm like this close to
getting a championship.

44:44.291 --> 44:44.917
Get up.

44:44.917 --> 44:45.291
Oh my god.

44:45.291 --> 44:46.250
Dude, forget that, man.

44:46.250 --> 44:47.209
I came back 3-1.

44:47.209 --> 44:47.625
It was this--

44:47.625 --> 44:50.166
Seriously, we need
to help this girl.

44:50.166 --> 44:52.375
She's incapacitated right now.

44:52.375 --> 44:54.041
Get the hell up, dude.

44:54.041 --> 44:57.709
Oh my god.

44:57.709 --> 44:59.291
Dude, you gotta do it.

44:59.291 --> 45:00.126
Dude, come on.

45:00.126 --> 45:01.333
There's got to be
another way to do this.

45:01.333 --> 45:02.458
Just open her mouth.

45:02.458 --> 45:03.959
How about-- how about--
how about I do that part,

45:03.959 --> 45:04.542
and you do this part?

45:04.542 --> 45:05.209
What?

45:05.209 --> 45:05.625
No.

45:05.625 --> 45:08.750
I'm her significant other,
so I have to save her life,

45:08.750 --> 45:09.208
all right?

45:09.208 --> 45:10.500
That doesn't even makes sense.

45:10.500 --> 45:11.209
Like, how--

45:11.209 --> 45:12.583
How does that not
make sense to you?

45:12.583 --> 45:13.333
All right?

45:13.333 --> 45:14.333
Why don't you do it?

45:14.333 --> 45:14.709
Because I'm--

45:14.709 --> 45:16.126
Why don't you feel compelled to?

45:16.126 --> 45:16.542
Dude, I'm black.

45:16.542 --> 45:17.750
She's gonna take me to jail.

45:17.750 --> 45:20.125
What the hell-- you cannot
just pull the race card out

45:20.125 --> 45:21.167
of nowhere.

45:21.167 --> 45:22.792
What-- this is how it
starts in TV shows.

45:22.792 --> 45:23.792
Friends are like, oh, go ahead.

45:23.792 --> 45:24.209
Go try it.

45:24.209 --> 45:25.125
And I'm like, oh,
OK, I'll do it.

45:25.125 --> 45:25.875
Jail.

45:25.875 --> 45:28.375
Just put your hands
on her face, OK?

45:28.375 --> 45:29.001
OK.

45:29.001 --> 45:29.917
OK.

45:29.917 --> 45:30.458
Oh, yeah.

45:30.458 --> 45:31.375
All right, dude.

45:31.375 --> 45:34.208
All right, you got it?

45:34.208 --> 45:36.667
So you lean her head back.

45:36.667 --> 45:37.166
You got it.

45:41.209 --> 45:42.167
That's too much.

45:42.167 --> 45:42.500
That might be too--

45:42.500 --> 45:43.126
Shit!

45:44.125 --> 45:45.750
Oh, oh.

45:45.750 --> 45:47.126
Mm.

45:47.126 --> 45:47.959
Ah.

45:47.959 --> 45:48.333
Mm.

45:52.126 --> 45:53.583
Jail.

45:53.583 --> 45:54.209
Jail.

46:01.709 --> 46:03.625
Mickey.

46:03.625 --> 46:05.041
Oh, that's a lot of throw up.

46:05.041 --> 46:07.001
What-- oh.

46:07.001 --> 46:09.000
So go over again
if you want to--

46:09.000 --> 46:12.834
if you-- oh god.

46:12.834 --> 46:14.291
It's gonna be OK.

46:14.291 --> 46:15.959
It's gonna be all right.

46:15.959 --> 46:16.917
Oh.

46:16.917 --> 46:18.458
Oh, whoa.

46:18.458 --> 46:19.583
What the hell do we do?

46:19.583 --> 46:21.500
Leave her ass in there
until she feels better.

46:21.500 --> 46:22.625
Seriously?

46:22.625 --> 46:23.792
What else are we gonna do?

46:23.792 --> 46:25.333
Look, she's got to
sleep that shit off.

46:25.333 --> 46:27.208
Throw a bottle of water
in there or something.

46:27.208 --> 46:29.042
I'm just glad we were there.

46:29.042 --> 46:32.166
Gio is a piece of shit.

46:32.166 --> 46:34.041
I've been trying
to tell you that.

46:34.041 --> 46:37.084
Who tries to mess with a
chick who's passed out?

46:37.084 --> 46:39.625
It's her own damn fault for
getting herself in that shit.

46:39.625 --> 46:41.458
You're kidding me, right?

46:41.458 --> 46:43.001
Please tell me you're joking.

46:43.001 --> 46:45.209
Look, I'm not saying what
he was gonna do was right,

46:45.209 --> 46:46.041
but I'm not gonna
sit here and act

46:46.041 --> 46:48.625
so damn shocked that that was
gonna happen to her, you know?

46:48.625 --> 46:50.667
You can't blame the
victim for rape.

46:50.667 --> 46:53.042
I'm not blam-- look
at it this way.

46:53.042 --> 46:54.417
Would you let one
of those promoters

46:54.417 --> 46:56.209
make your sister a drink?

46:56.209 --> 46:57.166
Hell no.

46:57.166 --> 46:58.959
And why is that?

46:58.959 --> 47:00.001
Because they're creeps.

47:00.001 --> 47:00.959
Exactly.

47:00.959 --> 47:02.291
That's all I'm saying.

47:02.291 --> 47:04.500
She should be aware
of her surroundings.

47:04.500 --> 47:07.375
Look, shit happens, and
I'm not denying that, OK?

47:07.375 --> 47:09.959
But she should at least lower
the percentage of chance

47:09.959 --> 47:11.583
that she'll be harmed
by somebody else.

47:11.583 --> 47:14.959
You of all people don't
live in fear of others,

47:14.959 --> 47:16.709
so why the hell should she?

47:16.709 --> 47:18.166
Should isn't reality.

47:18.166 --> 47:21.000
Should isn't gonna stop crazy
people from trying to harm her.

47:21.000 --> 47:25.041
Look, no matter how well-dressed
or protected someone is,

47:25.041 --> 47:27.875
crazy people are
still gonna be crazy.

47:27.875 --> 47:30.917
Well, maybe we figure out a w--

47:30.917 --> 47:33.126
Whe-- where am I?

47:33.126 --> 47:34.001
My place.

47:34.001 --> 47:34.375
You're safe.

47:34.375 --> 47:34.625
How are--

47:34.625 --> 47:35.041
No.

47:35.041 --> 47:36.208
No, no, no.

47:36.208 --> 47:37.125
Where are my car keys?

47:37.125 --> 47:38.166
Where are my car keys?

47:38.166 --> 47:40.417
Uh, I don't-- I don't know.

47:40.417 --> 47:41.750
Why did you bring me here?

47:41.750 --> 47:44.001
Uh, because Gio was
trying to touch you

47:44.001 --> 47:46.250
while you were passed out.

47:46.250 --> 47:47.083
That's it?

47:47.083 --> 47:48.166
I th--

47:48.166 --> 47:48.792
What?

47:48.792 --> 47:50.792
I just-- just where are my keys?

47:50.792 --> 47:51.375
I don't know.

47:51.375 --> 47:54.250
Would you just stop for
a second and talk to me?

47:54.250 --> 47:56.959
Cody, I cannot afford
to lose this job, OK?

47:56.959 --> 47:57.917
I need the money.

47:57.917 --> 48:00.208
So you're willing
to let them use you?

48:00.208 --> 48:02.667
I use them just as much
as they use me, OK?

48:02.667 --> 48:03.667
But that doesn't--

48:03.667 --> 48:07.041
Look, Cody, it's not pretty,
but it's my decision, OK?

48:10.042 --> 48:12.126
I know that what you
saw looked weird,

48:12.126 --> 48:14.542
but it was all a plan, OK?

48:14.542 --> 48:17.750
Sometimes he and I,
we try strange things.

48:17.750 --> 48:20.583
And what you saw was the plan.

48:20.583 --> 48:24.166
It was consensual, I promise.

48:24.166 --> 48:25.417
Where is he?

48:25.417 --> 48:27.083
I knocked him out.

48:27.083 --> 48:29.209
You did what?

48:29.209 --> 48:30.500
Are y'all together?

48:30.500 --> 48:32.333
No.

48:32.333 --> 48:33.709
I don't know.

48:33.709 --> 48:36.709
I'm not with anyone.

48:36.709 --> 48:37.583
You hit him?

48:40.125 --> 48:41.126
That's kind of hot.

48:43.667 --> 48:48.834
I just want to experience life
and have fun and experiment,

48:48.834 --> 48:49.792
OK?

48:49.792 --> 48:52.709
By getting roped in a coma?

48:52.709 --> 48:54.126
Don't judge me.

48:54.126 --> 48:58.792
How can you stand there and
expect me to be OK with this?

48:58.792 --> 49:01.583
What kind of a
relationship is that?

49:01.583 --> 49:06.583
Can't we just enjoy
a this summer, Cody?

49:06.583 --> 49:09.250
Look, you and I are not
going to be that couple

49:09.250 --> 49:14.125
that everyone cheers for to
win prom king and queen, OK?

49:14.125 --> 49:19.041
My job, it isn't pretty,
but I'm good at it.

49:19.041 --> 49:21.126
And not all of us
have our parents

49:21.126 --> 49:23.250
paying for our apartments.

49:23.250 --> 49:24.875
OK?

49:24.875 --> 49:26.667
Please don't judge me.

49:29.333 --> 49:30.917
I can't talk about
this right now.

49:30.917 --> 49:31.500
I need my keys.

49:37.625 --> 49:40.417
Look, they're probably
at the pre-game house.

49:40.417 --> 49:41.084
Screw it.

49:41.084 --> 49:44.042
I'll just call an Uber.

49:44.042 --> 49:46.083
I'm sorry, Cody.

49:46.083 --> 49:49.042
Please don't be mad.

49:49.042 --> 49:51.042
I gotta go.

49:51.042 --> 49:52.083
Call you later, OK?

50:00.000 --> 50:03.041
"Don't be mad."

50:03.041 --> 50:05.709
What the hell just happened?

50:05.709 --> 50:08.375
I guess it was consensual.

50:08.375 --> 50:09.001
Wow.

50:11.834 --> 50:13.542
Hey, look, man, that
wasn't your fault.

50:13.542 --> 50:14.750
There's no way in hell you--

50:14.750 --> 50:19.333
I just-- how can she be so--

50:19.333 --> 50:22.667
I think I'm just
gonna call it a night.

50:22.667 --> 50:23.709
And I'm sorry.

50:23.709 --> 50:25.792
I think I just got us fired.

50:25.792 --> 50:28.126
No, man, don't worry
about that shit.

50:28.126 --> 50:29.709
I'm glad we're done
with those guys.

50:29.709 --> 50:30.959
You get some sleep.

50:30.959 --> 50:32.458
Get some rest.

50:32.458 --> 50:34.126
Let me worry about
the next move.

50:45.167 --> 50:47.166
Dude, what the hell
are you wearing?

50:47.166 --> 50:47.917
What?

50:47.917 --> 50:49.792
Your shoes look like
they were eaten by a dog.

50:49.792 --> 50:51.959
Do you think he's gonna
be looking at my shoes

50:51.959 --> 50:52.917
the whole time, OK?

50:52.917 --> 50:53.583
You can wear--

50:53.583 --> 50:55.166
My eyes are up here, dude.

50:55.166 --> 50:58.458
He's gonna be seeing
this fine Italian shirt.

50:58.458 --> 51:00.083
Do they not have irons in Italy?

51:00.083 --> 51:03.001
This is mustard yellow, OK?

51:03.001 --> 51:05.458
It's this year's
fashion color, OK?

51:05.458 --> 51:08.917
I don't need you right now.

51:08.917 --> 51:10.917
Sorry about that, guys.

51:10.917 --> 51:13.583
Someone dropped the ball on some
inventory, blah, blah, blah,

51:13.583 --> 51:14.041
whatever.

51:14.041 --> 51:14.959
Not your problem.

51:14.959 --> 51:16.792
No worries.

51:16.792 --> 51:18.500
You guys are doing amazing work.

51:18.500 --> 51:20.458
Just a couple of things
I want to change.

51:20.458 --> 51:24.333
First, no shots of
pre-game partying or buses.

51:24.333 --> 51:28.166
It makes it look trashy and like
we're at a tailgating party.

51:28.166 --> 51:32.792
And we're also aiming for
a sexy but classy look.

51:32.792 --> 51:34.333
So we're talking
about the uptown

51:34.333 --> 51:36.834
crowds and local colleges.

51:36.834 --> 51:39.959
So you know, show mainly them.

51:39.959 --> 51:41.208
Them?

51:41.208 --> 51:42.084
Them.

51:42.084 --> 51:46.208
So more crazy, rich,
white people in the video.

51:46.208 --> 51:48.667
Look, we're both
minorities here.

51:48.667 --> 51:50.126
I'm not saying exclude us.

51:50.126 --> 51:53.042
I'm just saying
know your customer.

51:53.042 --> 51:55.209
The only color I
care about is green.

51:55.209 --> 51:56.917
Aside from that,
everything else is great.

51:56.917 --> 51:59.333
So I'll need you on
Thursdays for college nights,

51:59.333 --> 52:02.875
Fridays for EDM neon nights,
and then some Saturdays

52:02.875 --> 52:05.834
for celebrity DJs
and performers.

52:05.834 --> 52:07.750
Did you just say celebrities?

52:07.750 --> 52:09.417
Yes, sir.

52:09.417 --> 52:12.042
I'll even throw in a little
extra on celebrity nights.

52:12.042 --> 52:13.875
Hell yeah.

52:13.875 --> 52:15.084
Name your price.

52:15.084 --> 52:17.167
Well, we just got some
brand new camera equipment,

52:17.167 --> 52:19.542
and the total price also covers
all the editing, as well.

52:19.542 --> 52:21.625
And we do as many
re-edits as you like.

52:21.625 --> 52:23.001
But it's gonna be $400 total.

52:26.001 --> 52:27.375
Done.

52:27.375 --> 52:29.417
I'll see you
gentlemen on Thursday.

52:29.417 --> 52:30.042
Thank you.

52:30.042 --> 52:31.126
Thank you.

52:31.126 --> 52:31.500
Thank you.

52:31.500 --> 52:32.126
Pleasure.

53:40.417 --> 53:42.167
Ooh.

53:42.167 --> 53:42.542
I like that.

53:42.542 --> 53:43.167
OK.

53:43.167 --> 53:46.083
Just because I can do something
doesn't mean that I should.

53:46.083 --> 53:46.875
That's fair.

53:46.875 --> 53:48.000
I can behind that.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.208
You sure you're not like a
psych major or something?

53:50.208 --> 53:53.083
What kind of job would a degree
in psychology get me exactly?

53:53.083 --> 53:53.750
See, that.

53:53.750 --> 53:54.375
That right there.

53:54.375 --> 53:55.375
That's exactly what
I'm talking about.

53:55.375 --> 53:58.166
Why does everything have to be
about some type of end result

53:58.166 --> 53:59.167
or goal?

53:59.167 --> 54:01.500
Why can't it just be about,
hey, I really like that thing.

54:01.500 --> 54:02.125
I should try it.

54:02.125 --> 54:03.001
Life's short.

54:03.001 --> 54:03.917
Take a risk.

54:03.917 --> 54:08.041
I've watched you take risks,
and I think actually I'm OK.

54:08.041 --> 54:08.959
OK, that's fair.

54:08.959 --> 54:11.291
How about take a
calculated risk?

54:11.291 --> 54:13.834
OK, I'll take a calculated risk.

54:13.834 --> 54:14.625
OK, what's the risk?

54:14.625 --> 54:15.542
I'm not gonna tell you.

54:15.542 --> 54:17.083
What the-- it's a
risk, not a secret.

54:17.083 --> 54:18.750
It'll still come
true if you tell me.

54:18.750 --> 54:22.291
I'll take a calculated risk
if you would be more careful.

54:25.250 --> 54:25.875
Deal.

54:29.208 --> 54:30.083
What the hell is that?

54:30.083 --> 54:31.001
My pinky.

54:31.001 --> 54:31.709
Pinky promise.

54:31.709 --> 54:32.291
Oh my god.

54:32.291 --> 54:33.625
Give me your pinky, damnit.

56:21.542 --> 56:24.208
Dude, just because
a chick puts out

56:24.208 --> 56:26.417
doesn't mean that
you have chemistry.

56:26.417 --> 56:27.125
I agree.

56:27.125 --> 56:27.959
You're right.

56:27.959 --> 56:30.917
And the thing is,
she didn't put out.

56:30.917 --> 56:31.709
No.

56:31.709 --> 56:33.375
We made out a little
bit, and then she

56:33.375 --> 56:36.167
rolled over and went to sleep.

56:36.167 --> 56:37.500
You liked blue balls?

56:37.500 --> 56:39.000
Everything's not about sex.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.625
She had self-confidence,
self-esteem.

56:41.625 --> 56:42.458
She was witty.

56:42.458 --> 56:43.709
And she didn't put out.

56:43.709 --> 56:47.084
Dude, she sounds a lot like Kay.

56:47.084 --> 56:47.667
You know that?

56:47.667 --> 56:48.333
Ooh.

56:48.333 --> 56:51.208
You see, first of all,
that's a low blow.

56:51.208 --> 56:52.166
Second of all, no.

56:52.166 --> 56:52.792
Hell no.

56:52.792 --> 56:54.709
Kay was a compulsive liar.

56:54.709 --> 56:56.667
This girl, she's smart.

56:56.667 --> 56:58.001
I think she was testing me.

56:58.001 --> 56:59.375
Yeah, she didn't
put out because she

56:59.375 --> 57:01.875
wanted to see if I'd still
be interested in the morning.

57:01.875 --> 57:03.167
And guess what?

57:03.167 --> 57:04.167
I am.

57:04.167 --> 57:05.875
I am still interested.

57:05.875 --> 57:06.792
Yeah.

57:06.792 --> 57:09.041
Well, just remember
to tell drunk Jay

57:09.041 --> 57:11.001
that you like someone.

57:11.001 --> 57:12.542
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

57:12.542 --> 57:13.041
Yeah.

57:13.041 --> 57:14.959
Sober Jay knows that
you like someone,

57:14.959 --> 57:18.042
but drunk Jay thinks that
you're technically still single,

57:18.042 --> 57:20.333
so be careful.

57:20.333 --> 57:21.000
Whatever, man.

57:21.000 --> 57:22.834
Look, I'll be fine.

57:22.834 --> 57:24.792
No, I like this girl
way too much for that.

57:24.792 --> 57:26.001
And I just met you.

57:26.001 --> 57:27.583
I bet you talk to
all girls like this.

57:27.583 --> 57:28.208
OK, I'm sorry.

57:28.208 --> 57:28.917
I'm sorry.

57:28.917 --> 57:29.291
I'll stop.

57:29.291 --> 57:30.917
I was trying to be funny.

57:30.917 --> 57:32.250
It's not working, clearly.

57:32.250 --> 57:36.792
So can, um-- can we please just,
you and me, go back to the club

57:36.792 --> 57:37.750
and do some dancing?

57:37.750 --> 57:39.125
I'm serious.

57:39.125 --> 57:40.709
I have work in the morning.

57:40.709 --> 57:42.167
Not all of us
promote nightclubs.

57:42.167 --> 57:43.084
Oh!

57:43.084 --> 57:44.000
Oh, oh, ouch.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.167
OK, see, that's-- that's
the first problem.

57:46.167 --> 57:47.542
No, I'm not a promoter.

57:47.542 --> 57:51.126
I'm not one of the
promoter types, you know?

57:51.126 --> 57:53.917
And what would you say
are those promoter types?

57:53.917 --> 57:54.291
Come on.

57:54.291 --> 57:55.000
You know the type.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.084
It's the same guy.

57:56.084 --> 57:56.959
They're all the same.

57:56.959 --> 58:00.084
They're loud, chauvinist,
cocky, and they lie.

58:00.084 --> 58:01.041
They lie a lot.

58:01.041 --> 58:02.001
They lie a lot.

58:02.001 --> 58:04.542
Oh, I don't see any difference.

58:04.542 --> 58:06.834
Babe, I'm a videographer.

58:06.834 --> 58:08.875
Did you just make that word up?

58:10.083 --> 58:11.417
Damn!

58:11.417 --> 58:12.667
OK, I'm striking out tonight.

58:12.667 --> 58:16.000
All right, well, what can I do
to prove to you that I'm not

58:16.000 --> 58:18.209
one of those promoter types?

58:18.209 --> 58:23.500
Well, after tonight, nothing.

58:23.500 --> 58:24.500
Sorry, babe.

58:24.500 --> 58:27.084
Have a nice night.

58:27.084 --> 58:28.084
Hey!

58:28.084 --> 58:29.583
Where you going?

58:29.583 --> 58:31.875
Oh, OK, yeah, you
probably got curfew.

58:31.875 --> 58:32.291
You go.

58:32.291 --> 58:33.084
Yeah, whatever.

58:33.084 --> 58:35.583
I'm gonna go in there and I'm
gonna go talk to all the girls

58:35.583 --> 58:36.542
because they're just--

59:11.917 --> 59:13.250
Keep up, Cody.

59:13.250 --> 59:16.542
The only reason anyone knows
how lit a Club Life party was

59:16.542 --> 59:19.667
is because of our videos.

59:19.667 --> 59:22.417
Take some credit, man.

59:22.417 --> 59:24.917
"Oh, bro, what do
the girls look like?

59:24.917 --> 59:26.333
How big is the crowd?"

59:26.333 --> 59:29.583
"Oh my god, what
was the music like?"

59:29.583 --> 59:31.709
We are the club.

59:31.709 --> 59:33.834
They owe us, Cody.

59:33.834 --> 59:35.291
We gotta get what we're worth.

59:35.291 --> 59:36.709
I get what you're saying--

59:36.709 --> 59:38.458
like, I really do--

59:38.458 --> 59:41.834
but we got a good
thing going here.

59:41.834 --> 59:43.417
I'm not trying to make waves.

59:43.417 --> 59:45.208
See, that's that
feeling shit, Cody.

59:45.208 --> 59:47.250
You can't feel numbers.

59:47.250 --> 59:50.333
You gotta think,
look at the income.

59:50.333 --> 59:51.917
Look at the crowd.

59:51.917 --> 59:55.542
That's money that's
slipping through our hands.

59:55.542 --> 59:56.125
You know?

59:56.125 --> 59:58.209
I should've known
that prick Alex was

59:58.209 --> 01:00:02.667
a snake the second he said yes
so quickly to my offer of $400.

01:00:02.667 --> 01:00:05.792
$400 is fine, man.

01:00:05.792 --> 01:00:07.042
That works for me.

01:00:07.042 --> 01:00:10.709
Two days' work,
that's $800, plus $500

01:00:10.709 --> 01:00:12.959
if it's a celebrity event.

01:00:12.959 --> 01:00:14.125
Chump change.

01:00:14.125 --> 01:00:15.959
That's what that adds up to.

01:00:15.959 --> 01:00:18.583
We can double that.

01:00:18.583 --> 01:00:20.042
You're insane.

01:00:20.042 --> 01:00:22.834
I prefer innovative.

01:00:22.834 --> 01:00:24.041
Come on.

01:00:24.041 --> 01:00:25.834
$650 a night?

01:00:25.834 --> 01:00:26.625
For you, boss man?

01:00:26.625 --> 01:00:27.000
Come on.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.041
That's chump change, man.

01:00:29.041 --> 01:00:32.583
Have you seen how many customers
have been coming into your club

01:00:32.583 --> 01:00:34.000
since we started working here?

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.250
Those videos are killing it.

01:00:35.250 --> 01:00:36.042
Cody, tell him.

01:00:36.042 --> 01:00:39.001
You were just telling me,
"More people, bro, dude.

01:00:39.001 --> 01:00:41.166
We should get more
mon--" tell him, man.

01:00:41.166 --> 01:00:41.792
Come on.

01:00:41.792 --> 01:00:43.291
Why you being all quiet now?

01:00:43.291 --> 01:00:46.166
And you-- you fired an entire
marketing team, which is

01:00:46.166 --> 01:00:48.417
a beautiful move, might I add.

01:00:48.417 --> 01:00:51.083
They were unprofessional
and childish, anyways.

01:00:51.083 --> 01:00:54.917
So there's got to be money
just floating around.

01:00:54.917 --> 01:00:57.625
You're not telling me how
to allocate my money when

01:00:57.625 --> 01:01:00.042
it comes to my club, right?

01:01:00.042 --> 01:01:00.500
No.

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:01.458
No, no, no, no.

01:01:01.458 --> 01:01:02.084
No, sir.

01:01:02.084 --> 01:01:02.458
No, sir.

01:01:02.458 --> 01:01:08.166
I'm just protecting
my brand, if you will.

01:01:08.166 --> 01:01:09.875
I know my worth.

01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:11.291
You taught me that.

01:01:11.291 --> 01:01:13.709
You did learn something.

01:01:13.709 --> 01:01:17.250
Well, then you're right.

01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:19.500
We both have to look
out for our brands.

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:24.000
So $650 it is.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.583
Boom!

01:01:25.583 --> 01:01:28.167
Woo!

01:01:28.167 --> 01:01:30.917
Yes!

01:01:30.917 --> 01:01:32.042
Thank you, sir.

01:01:32.042 --> 01:01:34.417
We will continue to bring
the magic with every video.

01:01:34.417 --> 01:01:36.959
You better.

01:01:36.959 --> 01:01:37.333
Woo!

01:01:42.792 --> 01:01:43.667
I love that shit.

01:01:43.667 --> 01:01:44.041
All right.

01:01:44.041 --> 01:01:45.041
Let's go.

01:02:08.041 --> 01:02:09.750
They call her brat.

01:02:27.625 --> 01:02:30.000
What?

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:30.875
Hi.

01:02:30.875 --> 01:02:36.250
Yeah, can I get six honey
butter biscuits with chicken?

01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:41.875
Can I add bacon and
cheese to four of them?

01:02:41.875 --> 01:02:45.208
But leave the others
how they are, whatever.

01:02:45.208 --> 01:02:48.001
And then can I
get three shakes--

01:02:48.001 --> 01:02:51.875
one vanilla, one strawberry,
and one chocolate?

01:02:51.875 --> 01:02:59.083
And then those "al
carbon" taco things.

01:02:59.083 --> 01:03:01.166
Two of those.

01:03:01.166 --> 01:03:04.542
Um, and-- oh.

01:03:04.542 --> 01:03:08.125
Jay, do you want anything?

01:03:08.125 --> 01:03:09.084
No, that's all.

01:03:19.375 --> 01:03:20.583
Got you some water, buddy.

01:03:22.042 --> 01:03:22.917
It's nice and cold.

01:03:22.917 --> 01:03:25.042
There we go.

01:03:25.042 --> 01:03:26.625
I drank a little bit of it.

01:03:26.625 --> 01:03:29.001
But it's whatever.

01:03:42.625 --> 01:03:43.000
Hello?

01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:11.959
And I can't even front
'cause it's the life I chose.

01:04:42.166 --> 01:04:42.792
Shit.

01:05:29.583 --> 01:05:31.167
Hear my confession.

01:05:31.167 --> 01:05:33.542
Girl, you're the
source of my stressin'.

01:05:33.542 --> 01:05:35.542
I treat my loss as a lesson.

01:05:35.542 --> 01:05:37.126
Could be for nothin'.

01:05:37.126 --> 01:05:39.126
You could be out here finessin'.

01:05:39.126 --> 01:05:41.500
Instead it's my phone
that you're textin'.

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:42.417
Look to the sky.

01:05:42.417 --> 01:05:44.042
I thank God for my blessin'.

01:05:44.042 --> 01:05:47.208
I act like I'm good on
my own, but I'm flexin'.

01:05:47.208 --> 01:05:49.209
Girl, if I could--

01:05:49.209 --> 01:05:51.250
Are you OK?

01:05:51.250 --> 01:05:54.417
This isn't how I planned it.

01:05:54.417 --> 01:05:55.500
Planned what, Katie?

01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:57.001
What are you talking about?

01:05:57.001 --> 01:05:57.834
Um.

01:05:57.834 --> 01:06:01.250
Well, you see, I lied.

01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:03.084
About what?

01:06:03.084 --> 01:06:04.291
I wasn't in trouble.

01:06:04.291 --> 01:06:06.333
Then what the hell are
you doing out here?

01:06:06.333 --> 01:06:08.500
Does your mom know
you're out here?

01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:11.126
Just listen, and I'll
tell you everything.

01:06:11.126 --> 01:06:13.875
I hate that you think I'm a kid.

01:06:13.875 --> 01:06:17.375
I'm 18 now, and I want
you to see me as an adult.

01:06:17.375 --> 01:06:21.583
I'm dressed this way because
I like to dress this way.

01:06:21.583 --> 01:06:25.959
I don't want you to tutor
me anymore but only help me

01:06:25.959 --> 01:06:26.875
if I ask you to.

01:06:29.709 --> 01:06:32.250
My mom thinks I'm spending
the night at Lauren's, which

01:06:32.250 --> 01:06:34.834
isn't completely a lie
because when I'm done here,

01:06:34.834 --> 01:06:36.417
I'm headed there.

01:06:36.417 --> 01:06:38.500
I lied to get you here
because I knew you wouldn't

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:41.834
come if I told you why.

01:06:41.834 --> 01:06:44.166
You can tell me anything.

01:06:44.166 --> 01:06:45.041
I know.

01:06:47.959 --> 01:06:51.583
Well, I want you to be my first.

01:06:55.333 --> 01:06:57.126
Katie, no.

01:06:57.126 --> 01:06:58.126
Katie, no.

01:06:58.126 --> 01:06:59.208
No, no, no, no.

01:06:59.208 --> 01:07:00.126
No, Katie.

01:07:00.126 --> 01:07:01.625
Katie, whoa, whoa.

01:07:06.625 --> 01:07:09.083
I'm 18 now, and I
haven't, you know.

01:07:09.083 --> 01:07:12.209
And I don't want to be the only
one in college who hasn't yet.

01:07:15.042 --> 01:07:18.084
So I just thought, why not us?

01:07:18.084 --> 01:07:20.834
Us?

01:07:20.834 --> 01:07:23.042
Katie, look, it's not
that I don't think you're

01:07:23.042 --> 01:07:24.375
an attractive person, OK?

01:07:24.375 --> 01:07:28.834
It's just I'm supposed
to protect you, you know?

01:07:28.834 --> 01:07:31.125
Big brother.

01:07:31.125 --> 01:07:33.917
Like you said, get out of
jail free card, remember?

01:07:37.209 --> 01:07:39.417
You're not supposed to just
give your virginity away, OK?

01:07:39.417 --> 01:07:41.875
You're supposed to protect
that and share that moment

01:07:41.875 --> 01:07:43.001
with somebody special.

01:07:43.001 --> 01:07:44.750
Did you share yours
with someone special?

01:07:47.834 --> 01:07:50.625
You said you'd never lie to me.

01:07:50.625 --> 01:07:53.166
No, I didn't.

01:07:53.166 --> 01:07:56.166
I gave it away chasing
the idea that it

01:07:56.166 --> 01:07:59.500
was gonna make me a man, OK?

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:01.250
It was a terrible mistake.

01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:03.126
It's only a four
year difference.

01:08:03.126 --> 01:08:05.167
OK, I just had a birthday.

01:08:05.167 --> 01:08:08.126
That's what made it four.

01:08:08.126 --> 01:08:13.000
If we do this, that makes
me like all the people

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.709
that I was trying to
protect you from, you know?

01:08:15.709 --> 01:08:17.166
You're wrong.

01:08:17.166 --> 01:08:19.542
The people you told
me who were going

01:08:19.542 --> 01:08:23.250
to hunt me down
and manipulate me,

01:08:23.250 --> 01:08:26.167
I hunted and manipulated you.

01:08:27.082 --> 01:08:28.582
That's not funny.

01:08:28.582 --> 01:08:31.875
Yeah, it is.

01:08:31.875 --> 01:08:32.582
OK.

01:08:32.582 --> 01:08:33.209
OK.

01:08:33.209 --> 01:08:34.457
How about this.

01:08:34.457 --> 01:08:39.457
How about we talk about
this when I'm not drunk?

01:08:39.457 --> 01:08:40.792
Please?

01:08:40.792 --> 01:08:43.667
OK.

01:08:43.667 --> 01:08:44.041
Ught!

01:08:53.917 --> 01:08:56.792
Bring it in.

01:08:56.792 --> 01:08:57.166
Come on.

01:08:57.166 --> 01:08:58.166
Come on.

01:09:17.167 --> 01:09:17.542
Shit!

01:09:29.457 --> 01:09:31.084
Oh, my back.

01:09:47.375 --> 01:09:49.082
Yo, Jay.

01:09:49.082 --> 01:09:50.834
Hey.

01:09:50.834 --> 01:09:52.291
Get up.

01:09:52.291 --> 01:09:53.167
What happened?

01:09:53.167 --> 01:09:55.583
First off, I want to thank you
for the incredible work you've

01:09:55.583 --> 01:09:57.375
done this past month.

01:09:57.375 --> 01:09:59.834
Also, I hope you enjoyed
the free table and bottle

01:09:59.834 --> 01:10:02.042
service at your birthday party.

01:10:02.042 --> 01:10:03.792
We've received so many
great compliments in

01:10:03.792 --> 01:10:05.417
regards to your work.

01:10:05.417 --> 01:10:08.500
Unfortunately, we're gonna
have to end this business

01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:09.083
relationship.

01:10:09.083 --> 01:10:12.042
We can no longer
afford your product.

01:10:12.042 --> 01:10:14.875
So I wish you two
success in your future,

01:10:14.875 --> 01:10:16.167
and I hope you find clients--

01:10:16.167 --> 01:10:16.542
Mm!

01:10:16.542 --> 01:10:17.500
It's over!

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:18.709
Dude, no it's not.

01:10:18.709 --> 01:10:20.500
We'll just call and
renegotiate like always.

01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:22.500
Dude, if he wanted
to renegotiate,

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:24.709
he would have said so.

01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:26.417
Well, we don't just give up.

01:10:26.417 --> 01:10:27.291
We can try.

01:10:27.291 --> 01:10:29.583
The second that we
get in good with them,

01:10:29.583 --> 01:10:33.000
you're just gonna ask for
more money and ruin it again.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.709
You saying this is my fault?

01:10:34.709 --> 01:10:37.333
You can't keep your ego
in check for two seconds

01:10:37.333 --> 01:10:40.125
without doing some
reckless shit.

01:10:40.125 --> 01:10:40.750
Reckless?

01:10:40.750 --> 01:10:42.333
I'm the reckless one?

01:10:42.333 --> 01:10:45.083
Doesn't that make you stop
and think for a second?

01:10:45.083 --> 01:10:49.333
That me, of all people,
are telling you that?

01:10:49.333 --> 01:10:52.041
OK, you're so greedy now.

01:10:52.041 --> 01:10:55.041
And you're drunk
every single day.

01:10:55.041 --> 01:10:57.542
And you're never
satisfied with the result.

01:10:57.542 --> 01:10:59.001
OK,
Cody, since you're

01:10:59.001 --> 01:11:01.667
the oh-so-sensible,
logical one now,

01:11:01.667 --> 01:11:03.625
tell me what should
we have done?

01:11:03.625 --> 01:11:05.500
That's the thing.

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:08.583
We shouldn't have done anything.

01:11:08.583 --> 01:11:12.083
We should've just kept going
to work and making money.

01:11:12.083 --> 01:11:16.209
But no, we had to
save the world.

01:11:16.209 --> 01:11:18.084
We make videos, dude.

01:11:18.084 --> 01:11:21.208
I was just trying to get
what we're worth, man.

01:11:21.208 --> 01:11:23.291
And what are we worth?

01:11:23.291 --> 01:11:25.750
Please tell me.

01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:27.208
And I bet it'll
change in a week.

01:11:27.208 --> 01:11:28.001
Whatever, man.

01:11:28.001 --> 01:11:28.917
I don't need this shit.

01:11:28.917 --> 01:11:32.792
Just admit it, that you can't
control yourself anymore.

01:11:32.792 --> 01:11:34.458
The second that
money is involved,

01:11:34.458 --> 01:11:37.458
you become a completely
different person.

01:11:37.458 --> 01:11:38.041
Yeah, OK.

01:11:38.041 --> 01:11:39.959
What about you, Cody, huh?

01:11:39.959 --> 01:11:42.291
One of us prefers not
to settle all the time

01:11:42.291 --> 01:11:45.291
and just get by by
doing just enough.

01:11:45.291 --> 01:11:49.209
If we don't take ourselves
serious, no one will.

01:11:49.209 --> 01:11:52.084
Does that include running
around like some macho

01:11:52.084 --> 01:11:54.333
jackass in your fancy suits?

01:11:54.333 --> 01:11:58.083
I show up to business
meetings like I belong there,

01:11:58.083 --> 01:12:00.500
and not like some
stoner pothead.

01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:02.417
"Belong"?

01:12:02.417 --> 01:12:03.250
That's the thing.

01:12:03.250 --> 01:12:05.041
You want to belong there.

01:12:05.041 --> 01:12:06.208
Like, belong?

01:12:06.208 --> 01:12:09.417
I mean, god, that
racist son of a bitch

01:12:09.417 --> 01:12:12.084
probably wouldn't even
let you in the club

01:12:12.084 --> 01:12:14.375
if it weren't for your videos.

01:12:14.375 --> 01:12:16.375
See, they don't want you.

01:12:16.375 --> 01:12:18.166
You're nothing to them.

01:12:18.166 --> 01:12:23.167
You'd be sitting out in the line
if it weren't for your camera.

01:12:23.167 --> 01:12:26.750
Or maybe you lost sight of that.

01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:29.709
All we were supposed
to do was use them

01:12:29.709 --> 01:12:33.125
like they were
using us, remember?

01:12:33.125 --> 01:12:34.209
Us?

01:12:34.209 --> 01:12:35.291
We?

01:12:35.291 --> 01:12:37.750
What do we do
exactly, Cody, huh?

01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:39.375
Because if I'm recalling
this correctly,

01:12:39.375 --> 01:12:42.000
I found us that last
job while you were off

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.375
trying to be Captain Save-A-Ho.

01:12:44.375 --> 01:12:45.333
Yeah, remember?

01:12:45.333 --> 01:12:47.042
I edit all the videos.

01:12:47.042 --> 01:12:48.917
I do all the talking.

01:12:48.917 --> 01:12:51.458
What-- what do you
do, exactly, huh?

01:12:51.458 --> 01:12:53.875
Besides ride my coattails
from all the work

01:12:53.875 --> 01:12:54.667
that I'm putting in?

01:12:54.667 --> 01:12:56.084
Is that what you think?

01:12:56.084 --> 01:12:58.959
Dude, I don't know
what to think, OK?

01:12:58.959 --> 01:13:00.834
I don't want to
do this right now.

01:13:00.834 --> 01:13:02.625
I can't remember last night.

01:13:02.625 --> 01:13:03.417
Pieces are missing.

01:13:03.417 --> 01:13:05.208
I hurt a lot of people.

01:13:05.208 --> 01:13:07.959
I just want to fix all this
shit and go back to bed.

01:13:07.959 --> 01:13:11.126
Now, look, we can stand out
here and complain and whine

01:13:11.126 --> 01:13:13.250
all morning, or you can help me.

01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:16.458
Are you gonna help me or what?

01:13:16.458 --> 01:13:18.126
No.

01:13:18.126 --> 01:13:22.250
See, I don't want to
ride your coattails.

01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:24.792
Good luck with that.

01:13:24.792 --> 01:13:26.500
Cody.

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:29.084
Cody!

01:13:35.959 --> 01:13:42.291
Katie, um, did we do
anything last night?

01:13:42.291 --> 01:13:43.875
Oh, boy.

01:13:43.875 --> 01:13:46.750
Shit.

01:13:46.750 --> 01:13:48.083
No, we didn't.

01:13:52.167 --> 01:13:52.792
We didn't?

01:13:52.792 --> 01:13:54.792
We didn't.

01:13:54.792 --> 01:13:55.709
Are you sure?

01:14:00.417 --> 01:14:02.001
Oh, shit.

01:14:10.542 --> 01:14:12.291
Oh my god.

01:14:12.291 --> 01:14:13.167
Oh my god.

01:14:13.167 --> 01:14:14.875
Oh, that was close.

01:14:14.875 --> 01:14:17.001
Gee, thanks.

01:14:17.001 --> 01:14:17.500
No, no, no.

01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:19.625
I didn't mean it like, you
know-- in like a weird--

01:14:19.625 --> 01:14:21.125
I'm just kidding.

01:14:21.125 --> 01:14:23.792
I agree with what
you said last night.

01:14:23.792 --> 01:14:27.209
What, um-- what the hell
happened last night?

01:14:27.209 --> 01:14:30.209
I just-- I remember we
were standing pretty close,

01:14:30.209 --> 01:14:30.917
and, uh--

01:14:30.917 --> 01:14:33.041
And you blacked out.

01:14:36.625 --> 01:14:38.709
See, this is why drinking is a--

01:14:38.709 --> 01:14:39.083
wait.

01:14:39.083 --> 01:14:39.291
Wait.

01:14:39.291 --> 01:14:39.458
Wait.

01:14:39.458 --> 01:14:39.625
Wait.

01:14:39.625 --> 01:14:40.000
Wait.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.291
How did you get me out of there?

01:14:42.291 --> 01:14:47.209
Well, I tried waking you up at
first, but that didn't work.

01:14:47.209 --> 01:14:50.542
Then I tried dragging
you, but you're too fat.

01:14:50.542 --> 01:14:54.458
But then your phone rang,
and it was your friend Cody?

01:14:58.792 --> 01:15:00.125
Oh, shit.

01:15:00.125 --> 01:15:03.209
What's wrong?

01:15:03.209 --> 01:15:05.542
He and I, um, we got in a
little argument earlier,

01:15:05.542 --> 01:15:09.167
and I need to, um, apologize.

01:15:09.167 --> 01:15:10.291
Jerk.

01:15:10.291 --> 01:15:12.126
Yeah.

01:15:12.126 --> 01:15:14.125
Yeah, I am.

01:15:14.125 --> 01:15:17.126
Are we, um-- are we cool?

01:15:17.126 --> 01:15:20.000
Yeah, we're cool.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.667
What do you want
for your birthday?

01:15:21.667 --> 01:15:22.417
Hm.

01:15:22.417 --> 01:15:26.209
A hot fudge sundae.

01:15:26.209 --> 01:15:27.042
That's it?

01:15:27.042 --> 01:15:27.709
Yes.

01:15:27.709 --> 01:15:28.041
OK, cool.

01:15:28.041 --> 01:15:30.625
I'm gonna get you a new
laptop because yours is shit.

01:15:30.625 --> 01:15:32.667
And then we'll go get sundaes.

01:15:32.667 --> 01:15:35.583
OK.

01:15:40.084 --> 01:15:40.667
Hello?

01:15:40.667 --> 01:15:43.041
You need to help me fight
these 12-year-olds online, man.

01:15:43.041 --> 01:15:47.042
They keep talking so much shit
about my mom and grandma, dude.

01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:50.126
I don't know how these
kids think of these things.

01:15:50.126 --> 01:15:51.042
Like, honestly.

01:15:51.042 --> 01:15:51.417
Yeah.

01:15:51.417 --> 01:15:52.126
Yeah.

01:15:52.126 --> 01:15:53.167
Yeah, sounds good, man.

01:15:53.167 --> 01:15:55.209
Get your ass over here.

01:15:55.209 --> 01:15:55.625
OK, cool.

01:15:55.625 --> 01:15:57.167
I'll see you soon.

01:16:00.417 --> 01:16:01.126
You got him.

01:16:01.126 --> 01:16:01.625
You got him.

01:16:01.625 --> 01:16:02.000
Throw it.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.001
Throw it!

01:16:03.001 --> 01:16:04.166
Do it.

01:16:04.166 --> 01:16:05.458
Oh!

01:16:05.458 --> 01:16:06.084
Oh!

01:16:06.084 --> 01:16:07.125
Yeah!

01:16:07.125 --> 01:16:08.167
Damn!

01:16:08.167 --> 01:16:08.542
Oh!

01:16:08.542 --> 01:16:13.167
Rip your children's limbs
off and then beat your mother

01:16:13.167 --> 01:16:15.001
with those limbs?

01:16:15.001 --> 01:16:15.917
I--

01:16:15.917 --> 01:16:16.291
Wow.

01:16:16.291 --> 01:16:17.167
I don't know.

01:16:17.167 --> 01:16:17.625
I'm sorry.

01:16:17.625 --> 01:16:19.834
Hey, man, so I--

01:16:19.834 --> 01:16:22.333
I talked to Katie earlier today,
and I just want to say that--

01:16:22.333 --> 01:16:25.709
Oh, bro, skip that.

01:16:25.709 --> 01:16:26.417
We're dawgs.

01:16:26.417 --> 01:16:27.792
Shit happens.

01:16:27.792 --> 01:16:29.166
I appreciate that, man.

01:16:29.166 --> 01:16:31.166
Look, I don't give
you enough credit.

01:16:31.166 --> 01:16:33.250
You're always there,
especially when I screw up.

01:16:33.250 --> 01:16:34.792
And I screw up a lot.

01:16:34.792 --> 01:16:36.333
So, uh, thank you.

01:16:36.333 --> 01:16:37.709
You want a beer?

01:16:37.709 --> 01:16:38.542
No, no.

01:16:38.542 --> 01:16:40.000
Water would be perfect.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.125
All right.

01:16:42.125 --> 01:16:42.750
Soft.

01:16:46.041 --> 01:16:51.042
You know, I had an amazing time
with you last night, before--

01:16:51.042 --> 01:16:53.291
Before you were an asshole?

01:16:53.291 --> 01:16:56.417
Before I was an asshole, yes.

01:16:56.417 --> 01:16:57.917
Was that your ex?

01:16:57.917 --> 01:16:58.291
No.

01:16:58.291 --> 01:16:58.917
No, no, no.

01:16:58.917 --> 01:16:59.083
No, no.

01:16:59.083 --> 01:16:59.750
Hell no.

01:16:59.750 --> 01:17:03.167
No, it was-- it was-- her and
I, it was like a summer fling.

01:17:03.167 --> 01:17:05.084
We were hooking up off
and on, and we stopped.

01:17:05.084 --> 01:17:08.291
We stopped long before you and
I started talking, you know.

01:17:08.291 --> 01:17:10.959
And-- and Mickey and her
are really good friends.

01:17:10.959 --> 01:17:12.333
And she wasn't
invited to the party.

01:17:12.333 --> 01:17:13.417
And I was like,
that's kind of weird,

01:17:13.417 --> 01:17:15.208
but I didn't want her to think
it was weird because there's

01:17:15.208 --> 01:17:16.041
no feelings there.

01:17:16.041 --> 01:17:16.709
It was just--

01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:18.625
So you were a dumbass.

01:17:18.625 --> 01:17:20.375
I'm a dumbass, yes.

01:17:20.375 --> 01:17:23.208
I'm a big, stupid dumbass.

01:17:23.208 --> 01:17:25.209
Yeah, I know.

01:17:25.209 --> 01:17:28.500
You know, Cody and I are
just kicking it at the house

01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:31.500
if you want to swing
by, bite to eat.

01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:32.625
I can cook you something.

01:17:32.625 --> 01:17:34.041
It probably won't
be very good, but--

01:17:34.041 --> 01:17:35.458
Um, I can't.

01:17:35.458 --> 01:17:36.041
I'm packing.

01:17:36.041 --> 01:17:39.208
I'm heading to my
parents' for a week.

01:17:39.208 --> 01:17:40.792
Oh.

01:17:40.792 --> 01:17:43.001
Oh, in Aspen?

01:17:43.001 --> 01:17:45.208
No, idiot, in Houston.

01:17:45.208 --> 01:17:47.917
Yeah, that-- that sounds fun.

01:17:47.917 --> 01:17:49.375
That's real cool.

01:17:49.375 --> 01:17:51.250
You're not gonna cry, are you?

01:17:51.250 --> 01:17:55.250
Dani, I am so sorry.

01:17:55.250 --> 01:17:58.583
Yeah, you are.

01:17:58.583 --> 01:18:02.458
You sure you don't want to swing
by just-- just for a second?

01:18:02.458 --> 01:18:05.667
I don't think that's
the best idea right now.

01:18:05.667 --> 01:18:07.208
But maybe when I
get back, you can

01:18:07.208 --> 01:18:10.209
show me that casino in
Oklahoma or whatever

01:18:10.209 --> 01:18:11.917
that you were talking about.

01:18:11.917 --> 01:18:12.542
Oh, really?

01:18:12.542 --> 01:18:14.458
Because I was gonna
ask you to teach me

01:18:14.458 --> 01:18:15.583
biomedical engineering.

01:18:15.583 --> 01:18:18.250
But yeah, yeah, sure,
gambling sounds fun, too.

01:18:18.250 --> 01:18:20.750
Oh my god, I hate you.

01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:23.041
I have to go finish
getting ready.

01:18:23.041 --> 01:18:24.041
Later, Dani.

01:18:24.041 --> 01:18:25.000
Text me.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:25.625
Asshole.

01:18:32.917 --> 01:18:34.709
How'd it go, man?

01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:36.041
I don't know, man.

01:18:36.041 --> 01:18:38.959
I-- I screwed up pretty bad.

01:18:38.959 --> 01:18:42.542
See, you gotta go back
to dating black girls.

01:18:42.542 --> 01:18:43.125
You're so right.

01:18:43.125 --> 01:18:44.417
I know!

01:18:44.417 --> 01:18:46.583
They just-- they
just get us, man.

01:18:50.209 --> 01:18:54.709
Check who's social
media official.

01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:55.458
Ooh.

01:18:55.458 --> 01:18:56.084
Yeah.

01:18:56.084 --> 01:18:57.084
Yeah.

01:18:58.084 --> 01:18:59.042
You all right, man?

01:18:59.042 --> 01:19:00.709
Yeah, I'm good.

01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:03.959
He'll be looking pretty
ugly with that black eye

01:19:03.959 --> 01:19:05.209
for the next couple of weeks.

01:19:05.209 --> 01:19:06.250
Am I right?

01:19:06.250 --> 01:19:08.125
Hmm.

01:19:08.125 --> 01:19:11.000
Still do miss Mickey, though.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:11.625
Yikes.

01:19:11.625 --> 01:19:13.041
Ah, whatever.

01:19:13.041 --> 01:19:14.834
Just bottle those feelings up.

01:19:14.834 --> 01:19:16.208
I'll just push on forward.

01:19:23.041 --> 01:19:25.083
Dude, are you sure you're OK?

01:19:25.083 --> 01:19:25.959
Yeah.

01:19:25.959 --> 01:19:27.625
They deserve each other.

01:19:27.625 --> 01:19:30.458
Plus, I'll just put
it in the movie.

01:19:30.458 --> 01:19:31.084
Movie?

01:19:31.084 --> 01:19:31.834
What movie?

01:19:31.834 --> 01:19:33.250
Our film project?

01:19:33.250 --> 01:19:35.250
It's due in like
two weeks, remember?

01:19:35.250 --> 01:19:36.583
Shit.

01:19:36.583 --> 01:19:38.750
Bro, I don't even want to
touch a camera right now.

01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:40.125
I really don't care
if we fail or--

01:19:40.125 --> 01:19:44.542
Look, besides spending money
on fast food and lotion,

01:19:44.542 --> 01:19:47.084
I've been saving all my
money for the short film.

01:19:47.084 --> 01:19:52.959
And there won't be any ninjas
or horses in this one, OK?

01:19:52.959 --> 01:19:55.208
I'm listening.

01:19:55.208 --> 01:19:56.166
OK.

01:19:56.166 --> 01:19:57.625
Check it.

01:19:57.625 --> 01:20:07.291
Open up on two dudes outside
of a club, waiting to get in.

01:20:07.291 --> 01:20:08.917
Huh?

01:20:08.917 --> 01:20:09.792
Hm?

01:20:22.167 --> 01:20:27.750
I'm waiting for
you to come around again.

01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:30.375
But I can't wait forever.

01:20:30.375 --> 01:20:33.000
I'm waiting.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.750
I want you so bad.

01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:38.875
But I can't wait forever.

01:20:46.250 --> 01:20:49.167
I can't wait forever.
