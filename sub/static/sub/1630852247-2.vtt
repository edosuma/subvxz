WEBVTT

00:14.560 --> 00:18.720
SECOND HALF OF THE 2020-21 SEASON

00:21.120 --> 00:24.040
It's a wonderful feeling
to win the Club World Cup

00:24.480 --> 00:26.840
under the hot sun of Doha.

00:27.680 --> 00:30.960
FC BAYERN VS. ARMINIA BIELEFELD
4 DAYS AFTER THE CLUB WORLD CUP FINAL

00:31.320 --> 00:34.200
But it's tough to return
to the routine of the Bundesliga.

00:34.560 --> 00:37.040
You play against Arminia Bielefeld

00:37.400 --> 00:38.880
in the snow!

00:39.240 --> 00:43.520
It's really difficult after
such a wonderful final

00:44.440 --> 00:46.040
to get going again.

00:46.400 --> 00:49.320
But the league
is what it's all about for us.

00:51.240 --> 00:54.920
Every time FC Bayern doesn't
win the league, and we end second,

00:55.960 --> 00:58.200
we have a major crisis on our hands.

01:02.080 --> 01:03.680
Now a good short pass.

01:04.040 --> 01:06.240
He scores, out of the blue!

01:06.600 --> 01:07.480
Guys!

01:09.560 --> 01:10.920
What's going on?

01:15.960 --> 01:18.200
You're joking! Bayern's trailing 2-0!

01:21.160 --> 01:23.760
Bayern come again
with Leroy Sané, driving …

01:27.120 --> 01:29.880
Followed through by Alphonso Davies!

01:31.760 --> 01:34.280
Against Bielefeld we got off lightly.

01:35.920 --> 01:37.160
A 3-3 draw.

01:37.920 --> 01:39.760
But then, against Frankfurt,

01:40.400 --> 01:42.320
things went very wrong.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.040
The team started to tense up.

01:57.920 --> 02:01.120
Especially because
our next opponent was Dortmund.

02:04.640 --> 02:05.800
Stop that!

02:07.640 --> 02:13.080
What Hansi did can't be done again.
It's impossible to top. A total triumph.

02:13.440 --> 02:15.520
I expected Hansi to say,

02:15.880 --> 02:19.400
"Listen, I'm worn out.
This is the limit of what I can do.

02:19.840 --> 02:23.560
So please, let's go our separate ways."

03:28.840 --> 03:30.520
FEBRUARY 25, 2021 THOMAS MÜLLER
MEDICAL CHECK AFTER COVID INFECTION

03:30.880 --> 03:31.920
So far I'm all right.

03:32.920 --> 03:35.280
But apparently

03:35.640 --> 03:38.400
Covid can attack the lungs

03:38.760 --> 03:44.200
in ways you don't necessarily notice.
We'll know in a minute.

03:45.280 --> 03:47.240
And then I'll attack again.

03:50.720 --> 03:56.080
I was gone for only two weeks, and
they've changed the locks. That's crazy!

03:56.520 --> 03:58.720
But such is life.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.760
You can go in here …
- Hi. In there? - Right.

04:04.120 --> 04:08.120
You fit again? - We'll see in a minute.
- Okay, good luck. - Thanks.

04:08.480 --> 04:11.920
NO ACCESS - X-RAY
Please breathe in and hold your breath.

04:16.680 --> 04:18.280
Hi, guys!

04:20.800 --> 04:23.240
Are you sure?
- Very sure.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.400
Müller!

04:27.000 --> 04:29.520
Awesome!
- He's back.

04:29.880 --> 04:31.360
Hey, Süle!

04:31.800 --> 04:33.920
Welcome back! The May Bug.

04:34.280 --> 04:35.760
Welcome back!

04:37.200 --> 04:38.880
I was in the basement.

04:39.240 --> 04:42.800
There's a glass door by the stairs, and
I was completely alone. - Really? Damn.

04:43.160 --> 04:49.040
When we had lunch, I sat at a table
in the hallway in the basement.

04:49.400 --> 04:53.520
My wife sat on the basement stairs,
waving at me through the glass door.

04:53.880 --> 04:55.160
"Lunch!"

04:55.520 --> 05:00.400
I have to go. You're trying to engage me
in conversation. I don't like it.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.920
Good to have you back.

05:13.040 --> 05:16.120
I had a look at the numbers yesterday.

05:16.560 --> 05:17.720
And?

05:18.080 --> 05:19.680
Forget it!

05:20.280 --> 05:22.160
Cut the crap.

05:22.880 --> 05:25.440
Cough up some money,
we need new players.

05:26.240 --> 05:27.800
You have to be of some use.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.120
I suppose you're right …

05:32.800 --> 05:36.040
OLIVER KAHN - CEO
My name is Oliver Kahn,

05:36.400 --> 05:38.960
and I used to be a goalkeeper.

05:46.640 --> 05:48.840
For 14 years.

05:50.480 --> 05:51.560
And now …

05:52.000 --> 05:55.120
I've had the glorious idea to come back.

05:56.120 --> 05:58.440
Not as a goalkeeper but as a CEO.

05:58.880 --> 06:00.720
We need balls!

06:01.080 --> 06:02.920
Olli is a very relaxed person.

06:05.080 --> 06:09.800
As a goalkeeper he was
somewhat explosive, even dangerous.

06:10.160 --> 06:12.000
Here's Olli with an outstretched leg!

06:13.120 --> 06:16.480
If you ran towards Oliver by yourself,
you either passed

06:16.840 --> 06:20.080
or you took a shot quickly,
or he'd have eaten you alive!

06:23.320 --> 06:27.840
There's practically nothing I need now
of my goalkeeper self.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.480
May sound a bit schizophrenic, but …

06:31.000 --> 06:34.040
These raging emotions, the loudness …

06:34.840 --> 06:38.440
I just found that
I no longer achieved my objectives

06:39.000 --> 06:40.840
in this world

06:41.720 --> 06:45.400
by banging on the table or shouting.
On the contrary.

06:45.760 --> 06:50.080
On the contrary. Who'd want to work
with someone like that nowadays?

06:51.920 --> 06:55.960
I remember this so well.
I'm from Karlsruhe, and when I was about

06:56.320 --> 07:01.160
ten or eleven, I was the only one
waving an FC Bayern Munich flag

07:01.520 --> 07:04.040
in Block 1 of the Wildpark stadium.

07:04.400 --> 07:09.160
It shows you that
I already had a bold sense of courage,

07:09.520 --> 07:11.600
and that even as a child

07:11.960 --> 07:14.960
I was deeply
fascinated by Bayern Munich.

07:16.240 --> 07:20.400
Karlsruhe SC has an amateur
fill its most important position,

07:20.760 --> 07:24.080
the goalkeeper.
It's Oliver Kahn, 18 years of age.

07:24.440 --> 07:28.480
It's not like I've been losing sleep,
but I am somewhat tense.

07:29.280 --> 07:33.720
With me it's always been a matter
of adjusting my objectives.

07:34.480 --> 07:36.160
I wasn't all that talented.

07:37.400 --> 07:40.000
It was always the next

07:40.360 --> 07:43.280
realizable objective that I tackled.

07:43.640 --> 07:45.800
And then, suddenly, I realized

07:46.160 --> 07:47.960
maybe I could even join

07:48.320 --> 07:50.240
FC Bayern. Why not?

07:55.440 --> 07:57.560
A Bayern jersey weighs a bit more

07:58.200 --> 08:02.080
because of all the legends
sitting on your shoulder.

08:03.120 --> 08:06.680
You have to unburden yourself of that.

08:07.600 --> 08:10.800
It requires loads of willpower,
but it's a great challenge.

08:16.880 --> 08:21.960
Olli was obsessed with success
and hard work, but in a good way.

08:22.720 --> 08:25.120
Just keep going. Always keep going!

08:25.560 --> 08:28.080
Here's the championship shield!

08:28.440 --> 08:34.200
Depression, burn-out …
all these things came together.

08:34.960 --> 08:36.840
I was simply exhausted.

08:37.200 --> 08:40.760
This was in the late nineties.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.800
I think, if you're at home,

08:44.160 --> 08:47.000
at the bottom of the stairs,

08:47.360 --> 08:49.520
and you can't climb them

08:49.880 --> 08:53.200
without falling over from exhaustion,
you start to worry.

08:53.960 --> 08:56.040
Then you start to realize

08:56.400 --> 09:00.840
where all this has gotten you,
always wanting more,

09:01.200 --> 09:02.720
and more,

09:03.080 --> 09:06.880
and even more,
and still not being satisfied.

09:10.160 --> 09:15.440
If you're no longer able to find
a balance between tension and release,

09:15.800 --> 09:19.960
that's the point where your body
tells you, "That's it, I can't go on."

09:20.320 --> 09:21.800
Not everything

09:23.120 --> 09:25.560
is doable.

09:27.120 --> 09:30.160
For 40 years the club was shaped,

09:30.520 --> 09:33.080
first by Uli Hoeneß,
then by Karl-Heinz Rummenigge

09:33.440 --> 09:35.760
and Franz Beckenbauer,
all former players,

09:36.120 --> 09:39.080
who made the club what it is today.

09:39.440 --> 09:41.200
That's all true

09:41.560 --> 09:45.600
and important.
But it's my job to look ahead

09:45.960 --> 09:49.560
and make sure we'll be
just as successful in the future.

09:49.920 --> 09:52.520
Ultimately, I'll be judged by that.

09:58.320 --> 10:01.120
This match against Dortmund is crucial.

10:01.480 --> 10:05.240
Normally it would be just a game
for the German championship.

10:06.120 --> 10:09.480
But now we have Haaland to deal with.
The way he's been playing,

10:09.840 --> 10:13.880
no single guy will be able to keep him
in check. We'll have to be clever.

10:14.240 --> 10:17.640
If he's standing here,
you can no longer intervene.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.560
You'd have to stand here. You know?

10:20.920 --> 10:23.000
One-twos are especially dangerous.

10:23.640 --> 10:26.320
Gather round.
In a situation like this …

10:27.520 --> 10:29.240
Break through.

10:29.600 --> 10:33.400
So if we win the ball at this point,
we're back in the game.

10:41.080 --> 10:42.120
Leon …

10:43.600 --> 10:45.920
Right defense: in front of Haaland,

10:46.360 --> 10:51.920
or one of us attacks him from behind
and another one covers him.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.600
The first one's better, right?
- Yeah?

10:55.960 --> 10:58.640
We've always been doing it differently.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.400
Can't the one behind him win the ball?

11:02.640 --> 11:04.920
Let's just do what we always do.

11:05.280 --> 11:07.040
It's always worked.

11:11.400 --> 11:15.920
FC BAYERN VS. BORUSSIA DORTMUND
MARCH 6, 2021

11:18.000 --> 11:23.320
I don't need a kick in the butt. It's my
goal to play well and help the team.

11:25.520 --> 11:29.320
As I haven't won
the German Championship yet,

11:29.680 --> 11:34.120
it'd be phenomenal for me
if we could win it together.

11:37.720 --> 11:39.800
I don't really care about criticism,

11:40.240 --> 11:44.680
because I'm totally focused on myself,
and I like to feel some pressure.

11:55.320 --> 11:58.920
Playing for FC Bayern
means having to deal with pressure.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.400
I get a kick out of that.

12:05.280 --> 12:09.120
The match against Dortmund?
The kind of game you live for.

12:17.880 --> 12:20.560
It's the highlight
of every Bundesliga season:

12:20.920 --> 12:24.000
the clash between Bayern Munich
and Borussia Dortmund,

12:24.360 --> 12:26.480
the biggest game of them all.

12:37.200 --> 12:38.320
Holger?

12:38.880 --> 12:40.680
Can you hear me?
- Just fine.

12:41.040 --> 12:43.080
I spoke to you three times,
you never said a word.

12:43.520 --> 12:45.920
You're lying.
- But you can hear me now?

12:46.280 --> 12:49.280
Perfectly.
- Okay. Got it. Fine. Later!

13:01.760 --> 13:03.840
I don't believe it!

13:04.280 --> 13:06.080
What the heck?

13:08.560 --> 13:11.920
When the pressure mounts
and you start struggling with yourself

13:12.280 --> 13:15.800
and lose all confidence,
it gets even more difficult

13:16.160 --> 13:19.080
to keep your head clear and play well.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.280
Unbelievable!

13:37.120 --> 13:39.320
How many times, this season?

13:39.680 --> 13:42.360
So often, right?
But today it's against Dortmund.

13:47.040 --> 13:49.080
How good is this Haaland?

13:49.520 --> 13:51.560
The guy's a machine, man!

13:53.440 --> 13:56.080
I'm calling his agent tomorrow.

13:57.520 --> 14:00.240
But have him get a haircut first.

14:03.160 --> 14:05.480
It's okay to have fun on the bench.

14:05.840 --> 14:09.800
KATHLEEN KRÜGER - TEAM MANAGER
Stonily watching the game

14:10.160 --> 14:12.920
is definitely not for us. On our bench

14:13.280 --> 14:16.160
things are no different
than in a district league.

14:16.760 --> 14:18.560
Guys, go! Go!

14:40.960 --> 14:42.880
Back to a line of five.

14:48.600 --> 14:49.560
Stop it!

14:54.440 --> 14:56.320
Kiss my ass!

14:57.520 --> 15:00.960
Penalty!
- I think he's giving a penalty. Look.

15:02.840 --> 15:03.960
Right on!

15:04.400 --> 15:05.520
Very good!

15:21.080 --> 15:24.400
We're almost there, man. Almost there!
- Yes, yes!

15:25.400 --> 15:27.000
Very good, Jo.

15:33.360 --> 15:35.040
That was good, Leroy.
- Yeah.

15:35.480 --> 15:38.440
If we have room, we've got to focus!

15:39.760 --> 15:42.240
Niki, the way you trapped the ball …

15:45.280 --> 15:49.000
Come on, Lewa, two more!
Then I'll be satisfied.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.880
Anything else?
- Two will be enough.

15:53.240 --> 15:55.760
Let's turn this match around!

15:56.240 --> 15:57.440
Come on, guys!

15:59.840 --> 16:04.120
Wait as long as you can. If you move too
soon, they'll know what you're planning.

16:04.480 --> 16:07.280
As long as I'm standing around,
they don't notice me.

16:07.640 --> 16:11.960
It's only when I start running
that they know where I am.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.080
Dortmund kick off the second half
in the Allianz Arena.

16:20.440 --> 16:24.800
They'll try to start as well as they did
in the first half. They're pushing hard.

16:25.160 --> 16:28.960
They're looking to start this
second half on the front foot as well.

16:29.320 --> 16:30.760
Super, Leroy!

16:55.000 --> 16:55.960
Jérôme!

16:56.400 --> 16:58.640
Something's up with Jérôme.
- Jérôme!

17:00.440 --> 17:02.800
Twisted knee. Substitute!

17:03.320 --> 17:05.880
Kathleen? Javi!
- Send Javi in.

17:06.520 --> 17:07.960
Javi, come on!

17:09.400 --> 17:10.920
Just lean on us, Jérôme!

17:18.040 --> 17:19.440
Is that okay?

17:21.200 --> 17:24.200
Only twelve minutes remain on the clock.

17:24.560 --> 17:27.480
They will seem never-ending
for Dortmund's defense.

17:32.840 --> 17:34.560
Yes, super, Leroy.

17:44.560 --> 17:45.680
Goal!

17:46.040 --> 17:47.800
It's in! Goretzka!

17:52.280 --> 17:53.520
And it's just a few minutes to go!

17:59.000 --> 18:00.560
Go on, go on!

18:00.920 --> 18:02.800
One minute plus extra time.

18:05.560 --> 18:08.720
Here come Bayern.
Lewandowski takes a shot … he scores!

18:09.160 --> 18:11.480
He decides the game
in favor of Bayern Munich.

18:11.920 --> 18:15.400
They are performing
on a true championship level.

18:23.880 --> 18:26.560
Derby winners, men!
- Derby winners.

18:31.160 --> 18:33.000
FC Hollywood!

18:35.960 --> 18:37.640
FC Hollywood!

18:38.000 --> 18:40.920
Last time we won this derby was 2011.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.640
Listen up. Everyone here?

18:46.120 --> 18:49.760
First of all, congratulations.
A great performance.

18:50.120 --> 18:55.240
To come back from 2-0, well done.
Take two days off. See you on Tuesday.

19:11.200 --> 19:12.720
Bought it myself.

19:13.080 --> 19:16.160
No one needs to know.
- What settings does it have? Pressure?

19:16.520 --> 19:18.520
The speed of the wheels.

19:19.720 --> 19:23.880
You have to know how many yards, so you
just have to try it out? - Of course.

19:24.240 --> 19:27.400
Choupo, this is at maximum setting.
- Okay.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.080
Too fast, Choupo?
- A little.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.560
So step on it!

19:35.800 --> 19:38.200
I've raised the aim a little, hang on.

19:38.560 --> 19:41.320
Maybe a little bit more in my direction.

19:44.800 --> 19:47.320
Sorry. No speculating!

19:47.680 --> 19:51.480
Did you see that?
I just changed the setting.

19:55.640 --> 19:56.960
Oh, Choupo!

19:59.160 --> 20:01.360
We'll have to do some more testing.

20:07.200 --> 20:10.960
I was always a Bayern fan,
my brother was a Gladbach fan.

20:11.320 --> 20:14.720
They were the two top teams at the time.

20:15.840 --> 20:18.240
And I really wanted to play for Bayern,

20:18.600 --> 20:21.720
that's true. That was my great ambition.

20:22.080 --> 20:25.280
Here's Hansi Flick,
the player with his socks down.

20:25.640 --> 20:29.480
At first I used to be a goal getter,
people told me I was good.

20:29.840 --> 20:33.640
But in the Bundesliga I was
usually given a defensive position,

20:34.000 --> 20:36.960
because there I didn't score enough.

20:37.320 --> 20:39.960
One day I heard
a scout for Bayern had come

20:40.880 --> 20:42.760
to look at me.

20:43.680 --> 20:45.840
We lost 4-1.

20:46.600 --> 20:47.920
Great promotion.

20:49.040 --> 20:53.000
Then Uli Hoeneß called.
I remember as if it was yesterday.

20:53.440 --> 20:55.360
And we made a deal.

20:58.600 --> 21:01.040
A great time. I came here when I was 20.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.600
GERMAN CHAMPION 1987
We were just …

21:03.960 --> 21:05.560
a real team.

21:09.200 --> 21:13.320
He was very diligent, very involved.
He wasn't always a regular player,

21:13.680 --> 21:15.920
but his behavior was always exemplary.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.800
He was assistant coach
at the 2014 World Cup

21:21.160 --> 21:25.080
and for several years under Jogi Löw,
where he did a great job too.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.080
The world champion's
assistant coach, Hansi Flick!

21:30.680 --> 21:32.960
Hansi has ideas about soccer

21:33.320 --> 21:36.520
that suit FC Bayern
and the National Team very well.

21:37.120 --> 21:39.760
And he has bags of empathy.

21:40.120 --> 21:45.440
He is a communicator. The players
listened to him as well as to me.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.240
It's always nicest

21:49.600 --> 21:52.480
to prepare a squad
for a common objective.

21:54.920 --> 21:59.160
The only downside is that you're
always at the center of attention.

21:59.520 --> 22:02.440
You have to get used to
a lot of press conferences.

22:02.800 --> 22:06.400
That's cost me loads of energy,
especially over the past few weeks.

22:06.760 --> 22:10.200
Because you have to be
really careful what you say.

22:11.240 --> 22:14.960
A head coach has to face
challenges in several other areas too,

22:15.320 --> 22:18.720
like answering the media.
That takes away some time

22:19.080 --> 22:21.200
from the regular work.

22:22.800 --> 22:27.160
Hansi's problem was
that he'd shot from zero to a hundred.

22:27.520 --> 22:29.960
He had no experience
in these other areas,

22:30.320 --> 22:33.680
like handling the pressure,
the media, and the club bosses.

22:34.040 --> 22:39.160
He hadn't learned that over the course
of the years, like other top coaches.

22:42.640 --> 22:43.920
Bro!

22:44.640 --> 22:45.600
Let's go.

22:53.800 --> 22:57.120
David is a kind of fixed point
for everyone in the squad.

22:57.480 --> 23:01.280
He brings together the little groups
that every squad has.

23:01.640 --> 23:05.760
I don't know of any player
who doesn't get along with him.

23:06.120 --> 23:08.680
I've never seen this in anyone else.

23:09.040 --> 23:13.560
He contributes so much
in order to keep the squad together.

23:14.360 --> 23:16.680
I hope we pick this up from him,

23:17.040 --> 23:19.640
and that we
can pass it on over the years.

23:21.240 --> 23:22.400
Howdy.

23:26.640 --> 23:28.920
We welcome our colleagues
and our viewers

23:29.280 --> 23:32.560
to a media conference
with David Alaba. First off,

23:32.920 --> 23:34.880
you have made a decision

23:35.240 --> 23:39.720
that we will be discussing.
So tell us, what have you decided?

23:40.080 --> 23:43.400
Well, I have decided

23:44.880 --> 23:49.520
to do something new once this season
is over, and to leave this club.

23:50.480 --> 23:54.920
I can tell you, it was
definitely not an easy decision to make.

23:55.280 --> 23:57.080
It was very hard.

23:57.440 --> 24:01.560
First of all, I've been
with this club for 13 years now,

24:02.480 --> 24:06.880
and secondly,
this club is very close to my heart

24:07.240 --> 24:10.040
and I'm thankful to it for so very much.

24:10.480 --> 24:14.200
Right. Your questions, please.

24:15.680 --> 24:20.560
What tipped the scales after so long?
- Was it the way things were handled?

24:21.000 --> 24:25.320
It has been rumored that it was
a matter of money. - No.

24:30.480 --> 24:32.600
Was that okay? Yeah?

24:38.720 --> 24:41.000
Ciao-ciao.
- Ciao! - Thanks!

24:41.360 --> 24:42.880
Peter, ciao!

24:43.760 --> 24:46.120
FC Bayern shaped me in several ways.

24:46.560 --> 24:48.840
We're very much like a family.

24:49.840 --> 24:55.080
The club and the squad losing
a player like him, is devastating to me.

24:55.440 --> 24:59.200
He will be sorely missed as a player,
but what hurts most

24:59.560 --> 25:04.440
is that the person David Alaba
will no longer be with us next season.

25:04.800 --> 25:07.400
David is my baby brother.

25:08.280 --> 25:13.280
We talk a lot on the pitch.
He came a long way by my side.

25:15.040 --> 25:16.320
It's unbelievable

25:17.440 --> 25:21.920
what he's done for Bayern. We have to
understand and accept his decision.

25:22.680 --> 25:24.080
I love this guy.

25:24.440 --> 25:25.960
Right, Franckie?

25:26.800 --> 25:30.800
I was fortunate enough
to enjoy a great career here

25:31.160 --> 25:34.320
and celebrate incredible moments.

25:34.680 --> 25:39.320
You really want to leave? In that case,
all the best. - Cut it out!

25:40.760 --> 25:42.800
It was very important to me

25:44.800 --> 25:48.000
that I could say a few words to my fans.

25:48.640 --> 25:51.840
Especially after the last few months,

25:53.000 --> 25:54.600
where so much

25:54.960 --> 25:58.680
nonsense has been said.
It was no easy time, I must say.

26:01.560 --> 26:05.320
His achievements over the last
year and a half speak for themselves.

26:05.680 --> 26:09.440
He threw himself into the game,
even when it hurt.

26:09.920 --> 26:14.560
He just went out there, trying to do
his bit for the success of our team.

26:14.920 --> 26:19.680
He definitely helped shape an era
here at Bayern, and now it's over.

26:20.280 --> 26:22.720
I'll read you my favorite verse.

26:24.600 --> 26:28.040
It's Philippians 4:13.

26:28.880 --> 26:32.520
"I can do all things through Christ
who strengthens me."

26:33.800 --> 26:38.920
We've tried everything to keep David,
and it hurts to lose this player.

26:39.280 --> 26:42.400
At some point
you have to accept it, though.

26:43.480 --> 26:45.200
But it was tough.

26:51.640 --> 26:56.520
We don't need a player at that position.
Tell Damir not to call him.

26:58.360 --> 27:01.000
He called the coach again.

27:02.920 --> 27:05.760
Okay, we'll speak again soon.

27:06.120 --> 27:07.320
Ciao.

27:10.160 --> 27:14.280
I was born in Mostar,
where that wonderful bridge is.

27:14.640 --> 27:19.520
SALIHAMIDZIC - BOARD DIRECTOR OF SPORT
I had a totally carefree childhood.

27:19.960 --> 27:23.000
My dad was a police officer,
my mom was a teacher.

27:24.200 --> 27:26.320
I always wanted to be a soccer player.

27:28.240 --> 27:31.680
Yugoslavia
worked perfectly as a country.

27:32.040 --> 27:35.120
We all lived together very well
with each other.

27:36.040 --> 27:38.840
Our family lived a good

27:39.200 --> 27:40.760
but also

27:42.200 --> 27:44.160
very simple life.

27:52.280 --> 27:55.200
I started playing soccer at age eight.

27:55.560 --> 27:59.240
My dad was my first coach.
He'd played in the second division.

28:00.760 --> 28:02.640
So that's when it all started.

28:04.720 --> 28:06.800
I played for the Yugoslav National Team.

28:07.240 --> 28:10.480
Every republic,
Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, and so on,

28:11.280 --> 28:13.800
had their own national youth teams.

28:14.160 --> 28:19.640
But the U-16 national team
was the first Yugoslav National Team

28:20.000 --> 28:21.560
you could join.

28:23.960 --> 28:27.640
When I was 15, Red Star Belgrade

28:28.000 --> 28:32.200
played against Bayern Munich.
Our national team happened to be

28:32.560 --> 28:34.040
in Belgrade,

28:34.400 --> 28:36.360
so we could watch the game.

28:39.360 --> 28:42.040
When Red Star played against Bayern,

28:42.400 --> 28:45.280
I saw all the Bayern players.
All these big names.

28:45.640 --> 28:47.560
That was so cool!

28:51.520 --> 28:52.840
Augenthaler,

28:53.400 --> 28:54.600
Laudrup,

28:56.600 --> 28:58.600
a young Effenberg.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.920
And from then on
I couldn't get FC Bayern out of my head.

29:17.720 --> 29:20.160
Then I had to go home,

29:20.600 --> 29:25.800
but all direct flights from Belgrade to
Sarajevo were cancelled, so I knew …

29:26.520 --> 29:27.800
things back home

29:29.440 --> 29:30.760
were serious.

29:49.440 --> 29:52.280
The front was only six miles away,

29:52.800 --> 29:54.880
and after about two months

29:55.240 --> 29:57.520
my Dad came to me.

29:57.880 --> 30:00.120
We used to have a Kalashnikov at home,

30:01.040 --> 30:04.040
and a pistol. He said,
"Look, that's the two guns."

30:04.680 --> 30:08.960
Then we drove to where
I was to take my mom and my sister

30:09.320 --> 30:12.880
if things got tough,
if the front line should fall.

30:13.240 --> 30:15.600
A 15-year-old boy

30:17.000 --> 30:19.840
with a Kalashnikov under his bed,

30:20.200 --> 30:22.360
that's just not normal.

30:30.960 --> 30:34.880
One morning my sister came into my room.
"Get dressed, you're going to Germany."

30:36.000 --> 30:38.160
I said, "No, I'm not going to Germany."

30:38.960 --> 30:42.160
I was really close
to my parents and my sister.

30:42.520 --> 30:46.400
It came as a huge surprise to me
that I had to leave.

30:48.760 --> 30:53.280
I traveled to Dortmund
and from there by train to Hamburg,

30:53.640 --> 30:58.200
where I lived for six months, and then I
entered the HSV soccer boarding school.

30:59.680 --> 31:03.120
Felix Magath was head coach there,
and with him things took off.

31:08.520 --> 31:11.920
But I have to say,
this is really true about Germany,

31:12.280 --> 31:16.960
if you do your best and
give it your all, you will get a chance.

31:17.320 --> 31:19.000
And I got this chance.

31:19.360 --> 31:24.080
Maybe I demanded it, but I got it,
and I did everything to embrace it.

31:25.760 --> 31:28.800
Then … the move to FC Bayern.

31:33.560 --> 31:37.200
And the dream I had dreamt
as a little boy came true.

31:39.520 --> 31:41.720
FC Bayern became my home.

31:42.360 --> 31:46.480
And that's why I will always
give everything for this club.

31:53.720 --> 31:56.040
AHEAD WORKSHOP
KITZBÜHEL, AUSTRIA

31:57.840 --> 32:00.200
One in July and one in January.

32:00.560 --> 32:05.520
If they reject it, we'll just have to
accept it, won't we? But … yes, okay.

32:05.880 --> 32:08.520
Hang on a sec, I'll be right back.

32:08.880 --> 32:09.920
Jan?

32:12.200 --> 32:16.400
Yes. He wrote me something
totally different, namely

32:16.760 --> 32:19.560
5 percent this year,
10 percent next year …

32:25.360 --> 32:27.680
You do that and I'll get back to you.

32:31.160 --> 32:32.200
Too far.

32:32.560 --> 32:37.360
We're now entering a decade
in which many changes await us.

32:38.080 --> 32:39.960
Cool shot!
- Nice, right?

32:40.640 --> 32:44.240
The world goes on developing,
so soccer can't stay behind.

32:45.040 --> 32:47.240
Don't forget, this club was shaped

32:47.600 --> 32:49.560
over the course of decades.

32:51.560 --> 32:56.160
I started a major
strategy project called "AHEAD".

32:56.520 --> 32:58.160
These are the questions.

32:58.920 --> 33:01.960
"Where do I see
FC Bayern in the future?"

33:03.680 --> 33:05.320
"What will we represent?"

33:06.560 --> 33:10.560
"What developments will we have made?"
And of course,

33:10.920 --> 33:14.800
"What will we initiate
and what will we have left behind?"

33:15.160 --> 33:17.200
I'd like you all to come forward

33:17.640 --> 33:21.600
and grab a few pictures
that in your opinion best convey

33:21.960 --> 33:25.440
where FC Bayern will be in the future.

33:27.400 --> 33:29.120
What led to success in the past,

33:29.480 --> 33:32.520
doesn't necessarily
lead to success in the future.

33:33.040 --> 33:37.080
And we will have to submit to
this thought process

33:37.440 --> 33:40.600
as FC Bayern with our new leadership,

33:40.960 --> 33:43.520
and we do that with our project AHEAD.

33:44.400 --> 33:45.480
There will be

33:45.840 --> 33:48.120
DISCUSSION CULTURE, TRUST
different opinions.

33:48.560 --> 33:49.440
BROTHERS

33:49.800 --> 33:53.760
Some people have been here for ages
and want to hold on to the status quo.

33:54.120 --> 33:59.120
Whereas the youngsters say,
"Hey, let's change everything!"

33:59.640 --> 34:02.440
I came to this club ten years ago.

34:02.800 --> 34:06.280
If you open a paper today,
Bayern is everywhere.

34:06.640 --> 34:09.600
Women's soccer,
men's soccer, basketball.

34:10.040 --> 34:14.960
Which means the brand "Bayern Munich"
is more than just men's soccer.

34:15.720 --> 34:17.960
I think that's very important.

34:18.320 --> 34:22.880
We do it all for the fans,
for the people who support us.

34:23.240 --> 34:25.880
DOUBLE-THREAD QUALITY
It's a balancing act

34:27.240 --> 34:31.520
to connect the past with the future.

34:31.960 --> 34:36.360
It's a wonderful area of conflict,
but one thing unites all nine of us:

34:36.800 --> 34:41.160
we want to ensure Bayern's success
in the future, which isn't easy.

34:41.520 --> 34:43.600
We were always

34:43.960 --> 34:47.080
proud of our success,
and that we managed it

34:47.440 --> 34:49.560
without outside help.

34:50.160 --> 34:53.360
For instance,
some owner pimping up the club

34:53.720 --> 34:56.160
by pumping his own money into it.

34:56.600 --> 34:59.760
I hope this independence
can be maintained in the future.

35:00.320 --> 35:01.720
If we want

35:02.080 --> 35:05.480
to present our fans
with such events in the future,

35:05.840 --> 35:08.640
like winning the Champion's League,
not just once,

35:09.000 --> 35:13.240
but maybe two or three times
in ten years, we'll also need the funds.

35:13.600 --> 35:16.080
Which is why I added
"business development".

35:16.440 --> 35:20.680
I think it could be
very exciting to ruminate

35:21.040 --> 35:25.160
about other areas in which we could
expand the brand "Bayern Munich".

35:25.520 --> 35:29.880
I realize the subject of diversification
is often met with skepticism.

35:30.320 --> 35:33.680
So this … - It's time.
- You only have two minutes.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.760
Two minutes.
- Am I overrunning my time? Well …

35:40.800 --> 35:45.360
These are some of the thoughts I've had,
that I wanted to share in this setting.

35:52.560 --> 35:54.160
Okay, right …

36:02.960 --> 36:04.320
See this handsome guy?

36:08.840 --> 36:11.640
Some very handsome guys.
When I turned 17

36:12.000 --> 36:16.120
all I saw was, Bayern interested in you,
this one interested in you …

36:16.560 --> 36:20.440
so I thought to myself, like,
"Is this really happening?" Like,

36:20.800 --> 36:22.760
"Bayern really wants me
to go play for them?"

36:24.440 --> 36:29.000
I went home
and I just couldn't stop smiling.

36:29.880 --> 36:34.960
I'm telling you, you could've, like,
punched me out, I'd keep smiling.

36:38.200 --> 36:39.760
And when it was time to sign,

36:40.400 --> 36:42.880
I met with Hasan and Marko,

36:43.240 --> 36:46.880
and they told me, "You could play here,
you could play there." And I was, like,

36:47.240 --> 36:50.920
"I could play there? You do know
who plays at that position?"

36:56.240 --> 37:00.240
I mean, life is too short to be frowning
all the time and to be angry.

37:00.600 --> 37:05.000
If you look at my story, the things
my parents have told me are devastating.

37:07.280 --> 37:11.440
They fled from the war in Liberia
and went to Ghana, to a refugee camp.

37:12.200 --> 37:15.880
They said I shouldn't have been there.
It was loud, people running, screaming.

37:16.560 --> 37:19.800
My parents told me how
they were walking over bodies.

37:21.440 --> 37:24.760
They had me.
They were there for five years.

37:25.120 --> 37:28.640
I don't remember any of it.
It was a blurry time for me.

37:30.480 --> 37:34.280
Luckily they could leave
and go to Canada. Edmonton, Alberta.

37:36.080 --> 37:40.200
When we were growing up, our family
was the only support we had. My parents

37:40.560 --> 37:44.080
worked two jobs, night shifts, and I
was at home with my brother and sister,

37:44.520 --> 37:46.440
helping, changing diapers
and all that stuff.

37:46.800 --> 37:51.760
So for me my childhood was taking care
of my brother and growing up quickly.

37:53.640 --> 37:55.400
The earliest I played soccer

37:55.760 --> 37:59.160
was when I was nine or ten years old.

37:59.520 --> 38:02.160
I met this one friend
whose team was doing a tryout.

38:03.200 --> 38:06.680
I was a little nervous. So we went up
and the coach came and said,

38:07.040 --> 38:10.960
"Okay, you all made the team!" It was
really exciting. It was the first time

38:11.320 --> 38:13.280
I was on an actual football team.

38:13.640 --> 38:17.360
My goal is to reach a professional level

38:17.720 --> 38:21.040
and probably play with some of the pros.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
The Barcelona game was amazing!

38:25.440 --> 38:30.000
Obviously, Messi was the first guy
I got past, then Arturo came in hard.

38:31.480 --> 38:35.840
I was looking for a pass, but then I
overheard Thomas, going, "Go, go, go!"

38:36.200 --> 38:39.240
And I'm like, "Let me try something!"

38:42.920 --> 38:44.320
So I kept running.

38:44.680 --> 38:48.080
I spotted Joshua Kimmich come flying in
and I played it on top of him.

38:51.320 --> 38:53.800
He tapped it in. It was an amazing goal.

38:54.320 --> 38:55.360
Amazing goal.

38:59.320 --> 39:01.720
Just like I was shaped by my history,

39:02.080 --> 39:06.960
he was shaped by his. That's not
always easy, but it makes him stronger.

39:07.320 --> 39:12.840
And I think here with us
he'll have a sensational career.

39:22.280 --> 39:24.360
Today I'm a little nervous,

39:25.640 --> 39:28.400
because I think
this can be a tricky match.

39:29.800 --> 39:34.400
I'm looking forward to the game, yes,
but today I am a little bit tense.

39:37.640 --> 39:41.200
FC BAYERN VS. VFB STUTTGART
March 20, 2021

39:42.320 --> 39:46.600
It's my job, of course,
that we stay within a sensible budget.

39:46.960 --> 39:50.040
Especially
in these difficult times of Covid-19.

39:51.000 --> 39:55.040
Each of us has good ideas,
but at Bayern Munich the group decides.

39:55.400 --> 39:56.960
Alright?
- Fine, you? - Good.

39:57.320 --> 40:03.360
And once a decision has been made,
every one of us has to accept it.

40:04.640 --> 40:06.160
That's enough.

40:06.520 --> 40:09.080
And it's always only about the club.

40:53.640 --> 40:55.160
AGAINST RACISM

40:55.520 --> 40:59.800
Before the game I don't really
try to think about too much.

41:00.840 --> 41:03.960
You just have to be loose.
You have to be free in the mind.

41:04.560 --> 41:05.800
Play the game,

41:07.080 --> 41:08.680
and enjoy football.

41:09.040 --> 41:12.760
Okay, men, focus.
Today we won't allow a single goal.

41:17.760 --> 41:22.520
Then, when you go out on the pitch,
you remember the fans, the sounds,

41:23.160 --> 41:25.760
their chants, their cheering.

41:26.120 --> 41:28.200
You hear the fans inside.

41:46.720 --> 41:48.560
Will you look at this crap!

41:49.000 --> 41:49.920
You idiot!

41:51.680 --> 41:54.280
I knew I'd hit him hard,
and I felt I was too late.

41:54.760 --> 41:58.240
That's going to be a red card
for Alphonso Davies …

41:58.600 --> 42:02.440
Ref, that's ridiculous!
- … after 12 minutes!

42:05.400 --> 42:08.960
And I knew at that moment
I'd let the team down.

42:21.880 --> 42:23.720
It's nothing to lose sleep over.

42:24.080 --> 42:28.120
Just hope we win the game now, even
though it's gonna be tough for the team,

42:28.480 --> 42:29.600
with one man down.

42:47.320 --> 42:48.480
Oh, come on!

42:50.840 --> 42:53.800
Once you're out of the game,
you have no control.

42:54.160 --> 42:56.800
You just hope the team stays alive.

43:05.880 --> 43:07.040
Well done, boys!

43:49.120 --> 43:51.880
One man down and 4-0 at halftime!
