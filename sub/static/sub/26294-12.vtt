WEBVTT

00:03.829 --> 00:05.483
- I just heard from Dr. Shaw

00:05.527 --> 00:06.832
who informed me that you
caught a prescription error

00:06.876 --> 00:08.182
that the hospital made.

00:08.225 --> 00:10.488
- Honestly?
I'm a little impressed.

00:10.532 --> 00:11.794
There are not a whole lot
of paramedics

00:11.837 --> 00:12.795
that pay that much attention.

00:12.838 --> 00:14.231
- It's kind of my thing.

00:14.275 --> 00:16.451
- Would you like
to get dinner sometime?

00:16.494 --> 00:18.279
- Severide and I broke up.

00:18.322 --> 00:20.324
We're moving on,
end of discussion.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.587
- This is tougher than
I thought it was gonna be.

00:22.631 --> 00:26.374
- I'm not completely
over it yet.

00:26.417 --> 00:29.290
But I will be.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.639
- ♪ We love it!

00:30.682 --> 00:32.641
- Okay, glazed...

00:32.684 --> 00:34.208
- Yes.

00:34.251 --> 00:36.166
Uh, let's make this
women-only carpool

00:36.210 --> 00:37.646
a regular thing.

00:37.689 --> 00:39.082
Cruz and Otis have
the worst taste in music.

00:39.126 --> 00:41.084
- We should do a road trip.

00:41.128 --> 00:42.346
- Mm!

00:42.390 --> 00:44.740
- Look, I love my Truck boys,

00:44.783 --> 00:47.569
but what I need these days
is quality female time.

00:47.612 --> 00:49.397
- Mm.

00:49.440 --> 00:52.617
- ♪ 5-0-1's and your favorite
pair of shoes ♪

00:52.661 --> 00:55.533
- Hmm.

00:55.577 --> 00:58.841
Speaking of
"quality female time."

00:58.884 --> 01:00.625
What?

01:00.669 --> 01:02.584
- Good morning.

01:02.627 --> 01:04.847
- Well, looks like you had
a good night, too.

01:04.890 --> 01:07.197
- And it was a fun night.

01:07.241 --> 01:08.851
- Well, let's keep
the party going.

01:08.894 --> 01:10.679
- Ooh, yes!

01:10.722 --> 01:14.465
- We don't have to be at work
for another four minutes.

01:14.509 --> 01:16.206
- ♪ You know we love it

01:16.250 --> 01:19.209
♪ Ooh, yeah,
we really love it ♪

01:21.429 --> 01:23.561
- Whoa.
Sorry, Chief.

01:23.605 --> 01:25.563
- Running a little late
this morning, gentlemen?

01:25.607 --> 01:28.740
- Sorry about that.
Won't happen again.

01:28.784 --> 01:30.394
- Hey, sorry.
This one's on me.

01:30.438 --> 01:32.135
- This is on
that neighbor of yours.

01:32.179 --> 01:33.832
She practically cornered you
on the way out.

01:33.876 --> 01:35.399
- Oh, Shannon?

01:35.443 --> 01:36.574
Yeah, she's been trying
to get me to join her--

01:36.618 --> 01:38.141
some club a friend owns.

01:38.185 --> 01:39.142
- You gonna go?

01:39.186 --> 01:40.752
- I don't think so.

01:40.796 --> 01:42.493
- Why not?

01:42.537 --> 01:44.234
She's cute.

01:44.278 --> 01:46.193
You gotta admire
the persistence.

01:46.236 --> 01:48.325
- Well, you take her out, then.

01:48.369 --> 01:50.240
- All I'm saying is,
might be good to go out.

01:50.284 --> 01:51.415
Have some fun.

01:51.459 --> 01:52.547
- All right, well,
thanks, Doc.

01:52.590 --> 01:54.636
I'll keep that in mind.

01:59.467 --> 02:01.164
- Come on.
Do something.

02:01.208 --> 02:02.513
- What's the matter?

02:02.557 --> 02:04.428
- The guys on first shift
are a bunch

02:04.472 --> 02:06.300
of mouth-breathers,
that's what.

02:06.343 --> 02:08.476
- Yep, he thinks
the first shift broke the TV.

02:08.519 --> 02:11.305
- I'm just saying, we left it
in proper working order.

02:11.348 --> 02:13.220
- Are you sure that it's on
the right input?

02:13.263 --> 02:16.527
- Is "input" the same thing
as "source"?

02:16.571 --> 02:18.225
- Take cover, everybody.

02:18.268 --> 02:20.575
Grandpa Mouch is trying
to fix the newfangled TV.

02:22.011 --> 02:23.186
- Well, why does
a television set

02:23.230 --> 02:24.709
need 50 different buttons?

02:24.753 --> 02:27.451
- Did you just, uh, call it
a "television set"?

02:28.496 --> 02:30.237
Here.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.195
Let somebody who isn't a member
of the AARP have a look.

02:32.239 --> 02:33.544
- Easy there, nerd.

02:33.588 --> 02:35.981
Just 'cause you were captain
of the AV Club--

02:37.896 --> 02:39.637
AV Club?

02:39.681 --> 02:41.813
- Truck 81, Ambulance 61.

02:41.857 --> 02:43.206
Vehicular accident...

02:43.250 --> 02:44.599
- I'm gonna kill him.

02:44.642 --> 02:45.904
- All right, wait.

02:45.948 --> 02:48.342
Can you let him fix
the TV first?

03:03.008 --> 03:04.488
- Yeah?
- I didn't know what to do.

03:04.532 --> 03:05.837
The bike's crushing the guy,

03:05.881 --> 03:07.665
but I didn't think
I should move him.

03:07.709 --> 03:09.928
You tell me.

03:12.322 --> 03:13.323
- All hands on deck.

03:13.367 --> 03:14.846
Otis, get the backboard.

03:14.890 --> 03:16.848
- You got it.

03:19.938 --> 03:22.419
Give us some room.
Gotta get this bike off him.

03:22.463 --> 03:23.942
Brett, hold him steady.
- Yeah.

03:23.986 --> 03:25.596
- 81, watch the hot pipes.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.685
Careful,
this thing's a beast.

03:27.729 --> 03:28.947
It's gotta weigh 500 pounds.

03:28.991 --> 03:30.514
- All right, easy, guys.

03:30.558 --> 03:31.863
We're looking at
possible spinal injuries

03:31.907 --> 03:33.038
and head trauma.

03:33.082 --> 03:34.431
- Okay, on three.

03:34.475 --> 03:36.520
One, two...
all: Three!

03:36.564 --> 03:39.523
- We're gonna need a leg brace.

03:39.567 --> 03:41.003
- And down.
Okay.

03:41.046 --> 03:42.874
- We need to get his helmet
off of him.

03:42.918 --> 03:44.876
- Mouch.
- On it.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.878
- Foster, can you get
the strap?

03:46.922 --> 03:48.402
- Yeah.

03:51.448 --> 03:53.929
- Here.

03:53.972 --> 03:56.801
- Let me get in there.

03:56.845 --> 03:59.500
- Okay.
- Keep his head steady.

04:03.634 --> 04:05.897
- Okay.

04:05.941 --> 04:07.682
- Chris...

04:07.725 --> 04:08.987
- Don't move.

04:09.031 --> 04:10.554
It's okay.

04:10.598 --> 04:12.904
- Chris!

04:12.948 --> 04:15.907
- My name's Matt; I'm with
the Chicago Fire Department.

04:15.951 --> 04:18.083
You've been in an accident.

04:18.127 --> 04:20.434
- Don't worry, kid.

04:20.477 --> 04:23.350
We're going to Big Sur.

04:23.393 --> 04:25.917
It's gonna happen.

04:43.979 --> 04:45.502
- Backboard.

04:45.546 --> 04:46.764
- Let's get him
on the stretcher

04:46.808 --> 04:49.071
and start an IV.

04:52.117 --> 04:53.554
Yep.
- Yep.

04:53.597 --> 04:56.339
Okay, one, two, three.

05:05.479 --> 05:07.263
- Is he gonna make it?

05:07.307 --> 05:09.831
- I don't know.

05:09.874 --> 05:11.354
How'd it happen?

05:11.398 --> 05:14.096
- I just found him like that.

05:25.977 --> 05:28.937
- Uh, we got an interloper.

05:33.289 --> 05:34.464
- Thanks.
- Absolutely, thank you.

05:34.508 --> 05:36.074
- Hey, Trudy!

05:36.118 --> 05:37.380
- Hey.
I'm sorry, gang.

05:37.424 --> 05:39.077
I'll get this out of your way.

05:39.121 --> 05:41.079
Randall sent a 911 text

05:41.123 --> 05:43.517
that your, uh, firehouse TV
was kaput?

05:43.560 --> 05:46.433
- Dude, you asked your wife
to come fix it?

05:46.476 --> 05:49.392
- There's no fixing it.
It's beyond repair.

05:49.436 --> 05:52.308
- He asked me if I would bring
our spare TV from home.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.962
They just moved it inside.

05:54.005 --> 05:55.267
- Trudy, you didn't have
to do that.

05:55.311 --> 05:56.965
We can survive a shift
without TV.

05:57.008 --> 05:58.183
- Nope, it's my pleasure.

05:58.227 --> 05:59.359
Truly, my pleasure.

05:59.402 --> 06:01.361
Bye, honey.

06:01.404 --> 06:05.016
- Why is she so eager
to get rid of this television?

06:05.060 --> 06:06.931
- You'll see.

06:06.975 --> 06:08.280
- Hey, Kidd.
- Yeah?

06:08.324 --> 06:09.847
- You wanna finish
parking the truck?

06:09.891 --> 06:12.197
- Love to.

06:17.028 --> 06:19.466
Whoa!

06:19.509 --> 06:22.207
What the hell is this?

06:22.251 --> 06:23.644
- It's a television.

06:23.687 --> 06:25.428
That's rear projection.
- Uh-huh?

06:25.472 --> 06:27.648
- Tried and true technology.

06:27.691 --> 06:29.345
- I can't find
the right connector.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.043
- Of course you can't.
This thing is ancient.

06:32.087 --> 06:34.132
Hey, hey, is this, uh--
is this steam powered?

06:34.176 --> 06:36.352
Or do you have
to crank it by hand, huh?

06:37.614 --> 06:39.355
I mean, I must have been
in middle school

06:39.399 --> 06:40.443
when you bought this--

06:40.487 --> 06:42.880
Mouch is old!

06:42.924 --> 06:44.882
Get it, everybody?

06:44.926 --> 06:46.362
Mouch is
a doddering old man!

06:46.406 --> 06:48.364
Isn't that funny?

06:48.408 --> 06:50.148
At least I don't
spend my weekends

06:50.192 --> 06:52.020
pretending to fight dragons.

06:52.063 --> 06:55.371
Or play with Star Trek dolls.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.068
- Uh, they're action figures.

06:57.112 --> 06:59.375
- Ah.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.508
I may be an old man,

07:01.551 --> 07:04.119
but you're barely a man at all.

07:07.165 --> 07:09.559
You're an infant.

07:20.004 --> 07:21.963
- Wow.

07:22.006 --> 07:25.227
Somebody's got thin skin.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.244
- Hey, carpool women.
I need help.

07:42.287 --> 07:44.246
- You just missed
some real drama

07:44.289 --> 07:45.377
between Mouch and Otis.

07:45.421 --> 07:47.162
- I'm sure that's a big deal,

07:47.205 --> 07:50.252
but I have an issue that needs
attention right away.

07:50.295 --> 07:52.167
- What happened?

07:52.210 --> 07:54.561
- I was backing the truck up
for Otis and next thing I know

07:54.604 --> 07:56.084
I'm cutting the angle too much.

07:56.127 --> 07:57.172
And I didn't even realize
that I hit it

07:57.215 --> 07:58.478
until I got out and looked.

07:58.521 --> 07:59.566
- Is there damage
to the truck, too?

07:59.609 --> 08:01.611
- No, no, thankfully.

08:01.655 --> 08:03.613
But, God, you guys have gotta
help me fix this.

08:03.657 --> 08:05.528
I mean, do you know how much

08:05.572 --> 08:08.705
"woman driver" grief
I'm gonna get from the guys

08:08.749 --> 08:10.011
when they see this?

08:10.054 --> 08:11.142
- Yeah, Otis will be vicious.

08:11.186 --> 08:12.448
You should see his mood.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.667
- We don't have
to tell anyone.

08:13.710 --> 08:15.146
- Right.
- We can fix this ourselves.

08:15.190 --> 08:17.540
- Yes, yes, yes.

08:17.584 --> 08:21.370
- Uh, Foster,
your doctor friend is here.

08:24.460 --> 08:26.723
- Dr. Shaw.

08:26.767 --> 08:28.333
Hi.

08:28.377 --> 08:30.422
- Oh, I thought you were
gonna call me "Jim."

08:33.121 --> 08:34.601
Right, yeah.

08:34.644 --> 08:37.604
- Going out with a doctor
would be a nightmare.

08:37.647 --> 08:39.606
Just all that unchecked ego.

08:39.649 --> 08:41.695
- Foster's seeing someone
anyway.

08:41.738 --> 08:44.175
Poor guy never had a chance.

08:44.219 --> 08:46.047
- Okay.

08:49.311 --> 08:51.487
- I will be having drinks
with the good doc

08:51.531 --> 08:52.749
at The Aviary.

08:52.793 --> 08:55.273
- Ooh!
Swanky.

08:55.317 --> 08:57.580
- What about the woman
we saw you with this morning?

08:57.624 --> 08:59.539
- Oh, that's super casual.

08:59.582 --> 09:02.324
- Oh.

09:14.249 --> 09:19.646
I don't need this.

09:23.301 --> 09:25.216
- Oh, hey, Mouch.

09:25.260 --> 09:27.523
- Uh, Chief, can I, uh...

09:27.567 --> 09:29.133
- What up, Mouch?

09:29.177 --> 09:31.309
- Well, have you got any holes
you need to fill

09:31.353 --> 09:33.834
on first shift
or third, even?

09:33.877 --> 09:35.792
I heard Richie
has a baby on the way.

09:35.836 --> 09:37.185
Is he looking
to take any furlough?

09:37.228 --> 09:38.795
'Cause I could
fill in for him.

09:38.839 --> 09:41.102
- No, Richie hasn't
made a request.

09:42.277 --> 09:43.800
- Why?
Everything okay?

09:43.844 --> 09:45.193
- Yeah, yeah.

09:45.236 --> 09:46.673
Trudy and I are, uh,
just trying

09:46.716 --> 09:48.196
to sync up our calendars
a little better.

09:48.239 --> 09:49.589
I just wanted to see

09:49.632 --> 09:52.417
if there was any flexibility
in the schedule.

09:52.461 --> 09:54.376
- Well, all shifts are
pretty solid right now,

09:54.419 --> 09:56.639
but if something comes up,
you know...

09:56.683 --> 09:59.076
- Copy.
Thanks.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.094
- Heard you guys caught
a nasty motorcycle accident.

10:17.138 --> 10:19.706
- Yeah, rider was in a bad way.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.316
- He gonna make it?

10:21.359 --> 10:23.797
- Don't know.

10:23.840 --> 10:26.669
Hope so.

10:28.584 --> 10:29.890
The guy was delirious.

10:29.933 --> 10:32.109
He was talking to me.

10:32.153 --> 10:35.112
Pretty sure he thought
I was his son.

10:37.854 --> 10:40.596
- How did it happen?

10:40.640 --> 10:42.729
- Nobody saw it.

10:42.772 --> 10:46.602
Good road conditions,
no other vehicles involved.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.343
Might have been recklessness,

10:48.386 --> 10:50.214
but the rider isn't
some young punk.

10:50.258 --> 10:52.303
He's gotta be in his 50s.

10:52.347 --> 10:53.696
- What kind of bike?

10:53.740 --> 10:55.350
- One of those tall
travel bikes

10:55.393 --> 10:57.265
with the silver cargo boxes
on the sides.

10:57.308 --> 10:59.180
- An adventure bike.

10:59.223 --> 11:01.922
- If you say so.

11:01.965 --> 11:03.880
- You think he did it
intentionally?

11:06.666 --> 11:09.843
- Wish there was another
explanation that made sense.

11:09.886 --> 11:12.280
- Well, maybe talk to the cop
investigating the crash.

11:12.323 --> 11:15.196
See if you can get more detail
on how it went down.

11:18.808 --> 11:20.244
- Yeah.

11:20.288 --> 11:21.637
- Hey.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.205
Um, I put in that call
to Med for you.

11:24.248 --> 11:25.685
Victim had
a massive brain bleed.

11:25.728 --> 11:27.295
There was nothing
anyone could do.

11:27.338 --> 11:29.471
I'm sorry.

11:44.965 --> 11:47.881
- That's awful news.
That's just awful.

11:47.924 --> 11:50.100
My heart goes out
to his family, you know?

11:50.144 --> 11:51.798
- Yeah.

11:51.841 --> 11:53.930
This is
Lieutenant Kelly Severide.

11:53.974 --> 11:55.453
- Hey, how's it going?
- Hey, Nick Chaffee.

11:55.497 --> 11:57.238
- Chaffee was first
on the scene.

11:57.281 --> 11:59.153
Can you tell Severide how
you came across the wreck?

11:59.196 --> 12:00.763
- Sure.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.156
I was doing a loop around
the truck yards

12:02.199 --> 12:04.462
there on Moe Drive
as part of my patrol.

12:04.506 --> 12:07.509
Wasn't too much traffic around.
Usually isn't.

12:07.552 --> 12:09.337
Then up ahead
I see something spinning

12:09.380 --> 12:11.513
and I realize it's the wheel
of a motorcycle

12:11.556 --> 12:13.297
smashed up there.

12:13.341 --> 12:15.343
- And you didn't see any other
vehicles in the area?

12:15.386 --> 12:16.387
- No.

12:16.431 --> 12:18.825
No, it's a quiet stretch.

12:18.868 --> 12:20.740
But that's the thing--
you get these yahoos

12:20.783 --> 12:22.785
who get out there
and just gun it.

12:22.829 --> 12:26.093
Seems like this one just pushed
his luck a little too far.

12:26.136 --> 12:28.922
- He doesn't really sound like
a yahoo, though, does he?

12:28.965 --> 12:31.272
I mean, middle-aged guy
decked out in safety gear.

12:31.315 --> 12:34.014
- I've seen all kinds.

12:34.057 --> 12:36.538
But, yeah, it could have been
a mechanical issue,

12:36.581 --> 12:39.846
or maybe he hit
some road debris.

12:39.889 --> 12:42.370
I just felt so helpless
waiting there for you guys.

12:42.413 --> 12:44.764
I wish there was something
I could have done for him.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.156
- No, no.

12:46.200 --> 12:49.377
You did everything right.

12:49.420 --> 12:50.987
- I don't see a lot
of firefighters

12:51.031 --> 12:53.033
getting this involved.

12:53.076 --> 12:54.817
- The way he talked to me, I--

12:54.861 --> 12:57.820
I guess I just feel
some obligation.

12:59.822 --> 13:01.215
- I don't think
there's any cameras

13:01.258 --> 13:03.217
at the accident scene,
but I could check nearby.

13:03.260 --> 13:04.871
See if they caught
anything interesting.

13:04.914 --> 13:06.960
- That'd be great.
Thanks, Chaffee.

13:07.003 --> 13:08.265
- Sure thing.
I'll let you know.

13:08.309 --> 13:10.180
- Yeah, thanks.

13:14.402 --> 13:15.838
- It's not working.

13:15.882 --> 13:18.362
It's not enough suction.

13:20.103 --> 13:21.539
- I'm telling you,

13:21.583 --> 13:23.411
the hair dryer-air compressor
combo works.

13:23.454 --> 13:24.891
- We can't do it now.

13:24.934 --> 13:26.066
Third watch will be here
any second.

13:26.109 --> 13:27.894
Well, Sotero and Kendall

13:27.937 --> 13:30.592
are way too dim
to notice a dent.

13:30.635 --> 13:33.334
Maybe we should
blame it on them.

13:35.379 --> 13:38.469
Okay, fine.
We'll fix it next shift.

13:40.863 --> 13:43.126
Great.

13:48.305 --> 13:50.264
- Any fun plans tonight, Mouch?

13:50.307 --> 13:51.918
- No.

13:51.961 --> 13:53.354
- You're going to Molly's,
though, right?

13:53.397 --> 13:55.095
- Guess so.

13:55.138 --> 13:58.011
Ladies' poker night at home.

14:04.452 --> 14:06.280
- Did you see that?

14:06.323 --> 14:08.021
He didn't even say
"thank you."

14:08.064 --> 14:10.066
- Uh, you took a half-step
to the right.

14:10.110 --> 14:12.155
Not sure that gratitude
was in order.

14:12.199 --> 14:14.027
- Oh, right.

14:14.070 --> 14:16.856
Forgot--I'm the bad guy.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.122
- It feels like
we should do something

14:22.165 --> 14:25.386
to try and get them
to patch things up and--

14:25.429 --> 14:26.996
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.868
Don't you get caught
in the middle

14:28.911 --> 14:30.130
of those two stubborn bulls
or you're gonna be the one

14:30.173 --> 14:31.131
who gets gored
and left for dead.

14:31.174 --> 14:32.306
- Herrmann's right.

14:32.349 --> 14:33.524
It's hard to watch,
but it's better

14:33.568 --> 14:35.135
they work it out
for themselves.

14:35.178 --> 14:37.964
- Have they ever acted
like this before?

14:38.007 --> 14:40.662
- Not this bad.

14:40.705 --> 14:44.187
All the more reason
to let them figure it out.

14:47.538 --> 14:51.020
- So now Helen has
this tower of chips,

14:51.064 --> 14:52.935
but the rest of us
are tapped out.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.502
- Uh-huh?

14:54.545 --> 14:56.983
- Just as Helen is dealing
the last hand of the game,

14:57.026 --> 15:00.508
Denise screams,
"She's using a shiner!"

15:00.551 --> 15:03.903
Yeah, Denise is convinced
that Helen is using

15:03.946 --> 15:05.469
the reflection off her
silver bracelet

15:05.513 --> 15:07.123
to see our cards.

15:07.167 --> 15:08.255
Apparently it happens
in Vegas all the time.

15:08.298 --> 15:10.170
So to answer your question:

15:10.213 --> 15:12.694
Yeah, Denise is gonna
be here tonight.

15:12.737 --> 15:14.435
But, no, Helen will not.

15:14.478 --> 15:17.003
- Ah, well...

15:17.046 --> 15:19.005
I might stick around anyway.

15:19.048 --> 15:23.183
Could help refill
the Chex Mix.

15:23.226 --> 15:25.968
- Are you okay?

15:28.188 --> 15:31.060
Do you think it's time
for me to retire?

15:33.236 --> 15:35.543
- About once a year
you ask me this,

15:35.586 --> 15:39.068
and every time, what do I say?

15:39.112 --> 15:40.678
- I don't remember.

15:40.722 --> 15:42.550
- Mm-hmm.

15:42.593 --> 15:45.118
I say, "Randall McHolland,

15:45.161 --> 15:47.555
you are in your prime."

15:50.297 --> 15:54.475
- Not sure everyone agrees
with you there.

15:54.518 --> 15:58.044
- We do not care about them.

15:59.567 --> 16:01.656
- I'll be in the bedroom.
- Mm-hmm.

16:04.441 --> 16:05.747
- Wow, you must have

16:05.790 --> 16:07.053
racked up a ton of loans.

16:07.096 --> 16:08.750
- Some, yeah.

16:08.793 --> 16:10.404
It could have been worse.

16:10.447 --> 16:11.666
I managed to work through
most of med school.

16:11.709 --> 16:13.581
- That's impressive.
What kind of jobs?

16:13.624 --> 16:16.018
- Bartending, mostly.

16:16.062 --> 16:18.978
My science brain loved
all the chemistry of it.

16:19.021 --> 16:20.066
- That makes sense.

16:20.109 --> 16:22.242
You miss working
in the hospital?

16:22.285 --> 16:24.722
- No, not really.

16:24.766 --> 16:28.030
Guerilla medicine
is more fun in a lot of ways.

16:30.511 --> 16:31.773
You ask a lot of questions.

16:31.816 --> 16:33.209
- Am I asking
too many question?

16:33.253 --> 16:34.776
I'm sorry.
I'm not trying to grill you.

16:34.819 --> 16:37.431
Am I too much?
- No, it's sweet.

16:37.474 --> 16:39.999
- Well, I'm glad you think so.

16:41.609 --> 16:44.046
All right, your turn.

16:44.090 --> 16:45.439
You ask me anything you want.

16:45.482 --> 16:46.657
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

16:46.701 --> 16:48.398
- I've got one.
- Go ahead.

16:48.442 --> 16:51.053
- Do you wanna
get out of here?

17:14.424 --> 17:16.644
- Hey, what do you guys think

17:16.687 --> 17:19.560
about having a trivia night
here at Molly's on Friday?

17:19.603 --> 17:21.562
- Every bar has
a trivia night, Herrmann.

17:21.605 --> 17:23.303
- Uh, I wasn't asking you.

17:23.346 --> 17:25.305
I was asking our patrons.

17:25.348 --> 17:27.089
- Otis is right.

17:27.133 --> 17:28.351
You gotta do something
a little different with it.

17:28.395 --> 17:29.744
- What about Chicago trivia?

17:29.787 --> 17:30.788
You know the zipper
was invented here?

17:30.832 --> 17:32.094
- Mm, I doubt that.

17:32.138 --> 17:34.401
But Chicago trivia--

17:34.444 --> 17:36.359
not bad.

17:36.403 --> 17:38.100
- You waiting on someone?

17:38.144 --> 17:40.407
You keep checking
the front door.

17:40.450 --> 17:42.409
- No.

17:42.452 --> 17:45.455
- I'm sure that Mouch
is gonna show up.

17:52.419 --> 17:53.811
- Hey.

17:53.855 --> 17:55.639
Welcome to Molly's.
What can I get you?

17:55.683 --> 17:57.250
- Uh, I'm looking
for someone, actually.

17:57.293 --> 17:59.121
A firefighter named
Matt Casey.

17:59.165 --> 18:01.167
- Oh, yeah, Captain Casey.
Right there.

18:01.210 --> 18:03.343
- No.
- Excuse me?

18:03.386 --> 18:05.519
Uh, Matt Casey?

18:05.562 --> 18:06.650
- Yeah.

18:06.694 --> 18:08.522
- I hope you don't mind.

18:08.565 --> 18:09.871
The guys at your firehouse
told me I could find you here.

18:09.914 --> 18:12.352
Um, my name's Chris.

18:12.395 --> 18:13.701
Uh, I think you responded

18:13.744 --> 18:15.442
to a motorcycle accident
yesterday?

18:15.485 --> 18:18.358
- "Chris."

18:18.401 --> 18:20.534
Yeah, I was there.

18:20.577 --> 18:21.796
Was he, uh--

18:21.839 --> 18:23.189
- My--my dad.

18:23.232 --> 18:25.800
Yeah, uh, Patrick.

18:25.843 --> 18:28.542
- I'm--I'm so sorry.

18:28.585 --> 18:32.285
- Hey, Chris, grab a seat.

18:32.328 --> 18:33.677
Could we get you a beer?

18:33.721 --> 18:35.375
- Oh, no thanks.

18:35.418 --> 18:38.465
Um, I just flew in
from Denver.

18:38.508 --> 18:39.857
You know, trying to deal
with everything.

18:39.901 --> 18:42.904
Uh, family's pretty
shook up, and I--

18:42.947 --> 18:44.732
I guess we just want to know
how it happened.

18:44.775 --> 18:46.821
You know, the police report
says "rider error,"

18:46.864 --> 18:49.345
but there aren't any details.

18:49.389 --> 18:52.392
- Unfortunately,
there weren't any witnesses.

18:52.435 --> 18:54.611
- I know, so I was wondering
if you guys got

18:54.655 --> 18:56.570
a sense of it just from
what you saw at the scene?

18:56.613 --> 18:59.225
- Well, it was
a high-speed impact

18:59.268 --> 19:01.879
on a pretty wide open road.

19:01.923 --> 19:03.620
No other vehicles involved,

19:03.664 --> 19:07.189
so he must have
lost control somehow.

19:07.233 --> 19:09.235
- No, Dad's the safest rider
I know.

19:09.278 --> 19:12.194
I mean, he takes it
very seriously.

19:13.717 --> 19:14.892
- He, uh--

19:14.936 --> 19:19.245
he did
regain consciousness briefly.

19:19.288 --> 19:22.857
I--I think he thought
I was you.

19:24.859 --> 19:26.774
- Um...

19:26.817 --> 19:28.602
Did he say anything, or...?

19:28.645 --> 19:29.733
- It wasn't much.

19:29.777 --> 19:32.214
He--he just said, um...

19:32.258 --> 19:33.781
"Don't worry, kid.

19:33.824 --> 19:36.566
We're going to Big Sur."

19:38.307 --> 19:42.181
- Um, every August
me and Dad, um...

19:42.224 --> 19:43.443
he rides out to Denver

19:43.486 --> 19:46.228
and then we hit
the road together.

19:46.272 --> 19:48.361
Um, last year was Yellowstone.

19:48.404 --> 19:49.927
Year before that, New Orleans.

19:49.971 --> 19:51.320
Here.

19:51.364 --> 19:54.541
This is us driving
across Oklahoma.

19:54.584 --> 19:55.846
This year I told him I wanted

19:55.890 --> 19:58.675
to ride up Highway 1
to Big Sur.

19:58.719 --> 20:00.416
- Is your dad the one
with the camera?

20:00.460 --> 20:02.723
- Yeah, his GoPro.

20:02.766 --> 20:04.464
He loves that thing.

20:04.507 --> 20:08.424
I was hoping maybe
he was wearing it yesterday.

20:08.468 --> 20:10.513
- He never mentioned a camera.

20:10.557 --> 20:12.776
- I didn't see any.

20:12.820 --> 20:15.431
If he was wearing one...

20:15.475 --> 20:17.564
we'll find it.

20:28.052 --> 20:30.403
- What did the guy say?
"Far corner"?

20:30.446 --> 20:32.274
- Yeah, I think it's
over that way.

20:32.318 --> 20:34.929
Heard you got
some friction on Truck.

20:34.972 --> 20:36.365
- Otis and Mouch are at it.

20:36.409 --> 20:39.063
- Ooh, stand back.
- Yeah.

20:39.107 --> 20:40.891
You know how Otis
is always making cracks

20:40.935 --> 20:42.110
about Mouch's age?

20:42.153 --> 20:43.546
- Uh-huh.

20:43.590 --> 20:45.505
- Mouch finally reached
his breaking point.

20:45.548 --> 20:47.289
- Good for him.

20:49.073 --> 20:51.424
- That's gotta be it.

20:53.426 --> 20:55.558
That's the one.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.264
No camera.

21:05.307 --> 21:08.789
- Could have been mounted
on the handlebars.

21:11.008 --> 21:13.533
Nope.

21:20.409 --> 21:22.542
That's the GoPro mount
right there.

21:22.585 --> 21:24.021
Or what's left of it.

21:24.065 --> 21:26.459
It must have snapped off
in the crash.

21:28.939 --> 21:30.985
- Damn it.

21:37.470 --> 21:39.298
- Hey.
- Hey, buddy.

21:39.341 --> 21:41.256
- We missed you
at Molly's last night.

21:41.300 --> 21:44.346
- Oh, yeah, well,
the poker ladies

21:44.390 --> 21:47.306
begged me to stay, so...

21:49.656 --> 21:52.441
- Uh, don't you think Otis

21:52.485 --> 21:55.444
was just trying to be funny
when he was saying that stuff?

21:55.488 --> 21:57.490
I mean, maybe you guys
can smooth things over.

21:57.533 --> 21:58.926
- Hey, Ritter?

21:58.969 --> 22:01.276
No offense, but, uh,

22:01.320 --> 22:04.323
there's a lot of history
between Otis and me

22:04.366 --> 22:05.976
that you don't know about.

22:06.020 --> 22:09.110
I mean, he's been jabbing
his "you're old" knife at me

22:09.153 --> 22:12.461
for a long time, so...

22:12.505 --> 22:15.377
till I get an apology...

22:15.421 --> 22:18.337
there won't be any "smoothing."

22:29.043 --> 22:30.914
- Heads-up, hot water's out.

22:30.958 --> 22:33.439
- Hey.
I just thought you should know

22:33.482 --> 22:35.397
that Mouch was just
talking about

22:35.441 --> 22:37.878
how much history there is
between the two of you.

22:37.921 --> 22:39.619
- Oh, really?

22:39.662 --> 22:41.360
Did he say it like,

22:41.403 --> 22:43.013
"There's a lot of history
between me and Otis"?

22:43.057 --> 22:44.667
Or was it more like,

22:44.711 --> 22:47.453
"There's a lot of
history between me and Otis."

22:49.193 --> 22:51.108
I get the feeling
that all it would take

22:51.152 --> 22:53.894
to get past all this
is an apology.

22:53.937 --> 22:56.940
- Okay, yeah.

22:56.984 --> 22:59.682
When he apologizes,
we'll put it past us.

22:59.726 --> 23:02.206
- Oh, yeah, I...

23:02.250 --> 23:03.382
I--I meant--

23:03.425 --> 23:05.427
- I know what you meant.

23:05.471 --> 23:08.387
But, Ritter, if I'm not allowed
to make jokes,

23:08.430 --> 23:10.693
we're all dead.

23:10.737 --> 23:12.347
Humor.

23:12.391 --> 23:15.481
It's the cornerstone
of firehouse life.

23:15.524 --> 23:17.526
If we can't sit around
the common room,

23:17.570 --> 23:20.007
find a way to laugh
at tragedy--

23:20.050 --> 23:21.487
including Mouch's
advanced age--

23:21.530 --> 23:25.360
how are we gonna
survive the job?

23:25.404 --> 23:27.493
- Okay...

23:27.536 --> 23:29.103
what's going on?

23:29.146 --> 23:31.235
- Nothing.

23:31.279 --> 23:33.412
Just a kid--barely six months
under his belt--

23:33.455 --> 23:36.023
telling me how to be
a firefighter.

23:36.066 --> 23:38.504
- Yeah.

23:42.116 --> 23:43.422
- I know.

23:43.465 --> 23:45.554
Gored and dead.
- Mm.

23:45.598 --> 23:49.036
Hey, I gotta admit...

23:49.079 --> 23:52.169
thought they'd
work it out by now.

23:52.213 --> 23:55.608
We're in
uncharted territory here.

23:55.651 --> 23:59.350
- Mouch wouldn't
actually consider retiring,

23:59.394 --> 24:01.004
would he?

24:01.048 --> 24:02.484
- No.

24:04.399 --> 24:06.357
No.

24:09.622 --> 24:13.060
Good job, Ritter.

24:14.191 --> 24:16.019
- You really think it'll work?

24:16.063 --> 24:18.108
- All I can tell you
is if my dad knew

24:18.152 --> 24:20.110
how many dents I put
in his pick-up as a teenager,

24:20.154 --> 24:21.416
I'd still be grounded.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.462
- How much longer?

24:23.505 --> 24:25.507
- Mm, I'd say
a couple minutes.

24:25.551 --> 24:26.769
- Mm-hmm.

24:26.813 --> 24:29.293
- Hey, how'd your date go
with Shaw?

24:29.337 --> 24:30.643
- Great.

24:30.686 --> 24:34.124
Drinks, then we went
to my place.

24:34.168 --> 24:36.475
But I kicked him out
pretty early.

24:36.518 --> 24:37.606
- Mm.

24:37.650 --> 24:39.086
You think you'll
see him again?

24:39.129 --> 24:40.740
- He's fun,

24:40.783 --> 24:44.570
but I'm not really looking
for a relationship right now.

24:44.613 --> 24:47.181
- I never understood
the "one night stand" thing.

24:47.224 --> 24:48.399
I mean, if you have
a good time with him,

24:48.443 --> 24:49.662
why not go out again?

24:49.705 --> 24:53.056
- I was so focused
on becoming a doctor

24:53.100 --> 24:54.797
that I missed a lot of life,

24:54.841 --> 24:56.756
so now I just want
to take it all in.

24:56.799 --> 24:58.018
No limits.

24:58.061 --> 24:59.367
- Yeah, that sounds awesome.

24:59.410 --> 25:01.325
Yeah, I mean,
I'm never getting into

25:01.369 --> 25:03.327
a serious relationship again.

25:03.371 --> 25:05.416
- You just need some time,
that's all.

25:05.460 --> 25:08.158
- Nope, never.

25:08.202 --> 25:10.378
- Okay, here comes the air.

25:10.421 --> 25:12.336
Here we go.
- All right.

25:14.861 --> 25:16.384
- Ugh.

25:16.427 --> 25:18.386
I swear, the cold should
make it pop right out.

25:18.429 --> 25:20.823
Maybe the dent's too deep.

25:22.564 --> 25:24.131
- Ambulance 61, Truck 81...

25:24.174 --> 25:25.567
- Hey, don't worry.

25:25.611 --> 25:27.047
We'll find a way to fix it.

25:27.090 --> 25:28.222
- All right.

25:28.265 --> 25:30.093
- Thank you.

25:48.242 --> 25:49.809
- Hey, Casey!

25:49.852 --> 25:51.550
I'm leaving Capp
and Tony out here

25:51.593 --> 25:52.594
till we know
what we're dealing with.

25:52.638 --> 25:53.726
- Yeah.

25:53.769 --> 25:55.292
I'll take one
of my guys, too.

25:55.336 --> 25:57.294
- Probably won't be me.
I'm too old.

25:57.338 --> 25:59.122
- Well, I'm just
an infant, so--

25:59.166 --> 26:00.602
- Kidd!

26:00.646 --> 26:02.212
With me.

26:02.256 --> 26:04.388
- Stay warm, guys.

26:07.566 --> 26:08.610
- Where's the victim?

26:08.654 --> 26:10.612
- Up here at the Ziegler.

26:10.656 --> 26:11.744
- What happened?

26:11.787 --> 26:13.441
- These teenagers
treat this place

26:13.484 --> 26:14.877
like it's their
private clubhouse,

26:14.921 --> 26:17.227
and that is how you end up
with one of them

26:17.271 --> 26:19.229
getting his head stuck
in the Ziegler.

26:19.273 --> 26:20.709
- What's a "Ziegler"?

26:20.753 --> 26:23.843
Fritz Ziegler?
The modern sculptor?

26:23.886 --> 26:26.541
That is a Ziegler.

26:29.196 --> 26:30.632
- Hurry up,
he's choking!

26:30.676 --> 26:33.330
- Make way.

26:37.770 --> 26:39.641
- I can't breathe.

26:47.301 --> 26:49.390
- Could the angle of his head
be restricting the airway?

26:49.433 --> 26:51.087
- His pulse is racing.

26:51.131 --> 26:52.654
I think he's having
a panic attack.

26:52.698 --> 26:55.918
Just try and calm down
for me, okay?

26:55.962 --> 26:57.485
- What's his name?
- Aidan.

26:57.528 --> 26:59.052
- Listen to me, Aidan.
We're gonna get you out.

26:59.095 --> 27:01.271
Just try to relax
and be still, okay?

27:01.315 --> 27:03.796
- I'll try but I--I can't
get my head out.

27:03.839 --> 27:06.102
- How'd you get it in there?
- It's crazy.

27:06.146 --> 27:07.800
It slipped right through,
but now it won't come out

27:07.843 --> 27:09.279
no matter what we try.

27:09.323 --> 27:10.977
- Okay, give us some space
to do our work.

27:11.020 --> 27:12.718
We'll take care of him.
- I'm not leaving him.

27:12.761 --> 27:14.763
- You don't have to go far.
Just stay right here.

27:14.807 --> 27:17.331
- We make one quick cut here,
pry this side back,

27:17.374 --> 27:19.246
it might give us an inch
or so to play with.

27:19.289 --> 27:21.465
- I'm sorry, you want
to saw into the Ziegler?

27:21.509 --> 27:23.032
- Well, we don't have
many options here.

27:23.076 --> 27:24.817
We got a kid in danger.

27:24.860 --> 27:27.123
Hey, Capp, bring the band saw
and the bottle jack.

27:27.167 --> 27:28.255
- On it.

27:28.298 --> 27:29.909
- Get this thing off of me.

27:29.952 --> 27:31.737
- Easy, Aidan.
- Wait, wait, wait.

27:31.780 --> 27:33.129
It's not welded at the base.

27:33.173 --> 27:36.524
Maybe we can just
detach it from here.

27:36.567 --> 27:38.744
- Yeah, okay.

27:38.787 --> 27:40.528
Hey, Capp, hold off
on the saw.

27:40.571 --> 27:42.922
- Copy that!

27:54.847 --> 27:56.022
- Got it.
- That's good, that's good.

27:58.154 --> 28:00.200
- Bag's coming in.

28:00.243 --> 28:02.202
- All right, bag's going up.

28:14.605 --> 28:17.043
- Set.
- All right, bag's coming down.

28:21.787 --> 28:23.049
- Otis, can you grab me
an inch and a quarter?

28:23.092 --> 28:25.486
- Coming right up.
- Hang on, buddy.

28:30.273 --> 28:33.320
- Almost.

28:33.363 --> 28:35.104
You got him?

28:37.237 --> 28:38.978
- Can you move?
- Yeah.

28:43.286 --> 28:44.461
- Ready.

28:48.248 --> 28:50.859
- Stretcher.

28:50.903 --> 28:53.035
- You got him?
- Yep.

29:00.477 --> 29:04.481
- All right, let's put
this ugly thing back together.

29:04.525 --> 29:05.918
- Thank God.

29:05.961 --> 29:07.528
Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

29:07.571 --> 29:09.225
- Well, it looks like
you made it out in one piece,

29:09.269 --> 29:10.444
but we're gonna get you
to the hospital anyway

29:10.487 --> 29:11.880
just to make sure.

29:11.924 --> 29:13.099
- Okay.
- I'm coming with you.

29:13.142 --> 29:16.058
- I figured you would.
Come on.

29:18.191 --> 29:20.323
- Hey, that motorcycle crash?

29:20.367 --> 29:22.151
It's just a few minutes
from here.

29:22.195 --> 29:24.197
- Yeah, let's swing by
before we head back.

29:24.240 --> 29:26.808
- Yeah.

29:28.984 --> 29:30.943
- Hey, you guys?

29:30.986 --> 29:33.249
I just wanted to say thank you
for helping Aidan.

29:33.293 --> 29:35.295
He's, like, the sweetest guy
in the world.

29:35.338 --> 29:37.166
He tutors little kids
at school and everything.

29:37.210 --> 29:38.472
- He sounds awesome.

29:38.515 --> 29:40.343
- I'd better get back
to seeing Aidan.

29:40.387 --> 29:43.607
His parents will be here soon.

29:43.651 --> 29:45.609
- Aww, young love.

29:45.653 --> 29:48.656
- See, you are a romantic.
- Yeah.

29:48.699 --> 29:50.614
When it comes to
other people's romance, great.

29:50.658 --> 29:52.312
Mine, on the other hand--

29:52.355 --> 29:54.967
- Is headed this way.

29:55.010 --> 29:56.359
I'm gonna give you two
a minute.

29:58.709 --> 30:00.146
- Hey.
- Hi.

30:00.189 --> 30:02.148
- I am glad I ran into you.

30:02.191 --> 30:05.978
So it turns out
I'm not working tomorrow.

30:06.021 --> 30:08.328
Any chance you're free?
- Oh.

30:08.371 --> 30:11.548
Uh, no, sorry.

30:11.592 --> 30:13.855
I had a great time with you

30:13.899 --> 30:16.162
last night, Jim, I did.

30:16.205 --> 30:18.904
But I'm not really looking
for anything serious

30:18.947 --> 30:20.644
right now, so...

30:20.688 --> 30:21.994
- Yeah.

30:22.037 --> 30:23.343
Yes, sure.

30:23.386 --> 30:26.346
I, uh--I totally get that.

30:26.389 --> 30:28.043
- Great.

30:29.653 --> 30:31.525
See you around.

30:31.568 --> 30:34.528
- Mm, I feel bad for him.

30:34.571 --> 30:35.659
- Please.

30:35.703 --> 30:37.139
Do you know how many women

30:37.183 --> 30:39.228
he has said that to
over the years?

30:39.272 --> 30:42.188
Girl, he can handle it.

30:45.582 --> 30:47.454
- So the bike came
from that direction,

30:47.497 --> 30:49.369
ended up wedged
against this thing.

30:49.412 --> 30:52.546
So the camera could be anywhere
along this path.

30:55.549 --> 30:57.551
- There's no debris at all.

30:57.594 --> 31:00.946
- Yeah, it's a pretty clean
stretch of road.

31:00.989 --> 31:03.209
What the hell?

31:04.645 --> 31:07.213
Hey, there!
- Yeah?

31:08.954 --> 31:11.608
- Did you guys clean up
back here at the intersection?

31:11.652 --> 31:13.393
- Uh-huh.

31:13.436 --> 31:16.700
- Mind if we look through
your trash bags?

31:16.744 --> 31:18.615
- Whatever turns you on, man.

31:18.659 --> 31:21.749
- Thanks.

31:21.792 --> 31:24.099
- Hey, Truck, Squad,
everyone out.

31:24.143 --> 31:26.580
Time to get dirty.

31:31.150 --> 31:33.239
- This is some jerry-rigged
crazy right here.

31:33.282 --> 31:35.110
- Stella, just be careful
not to scratch the paint.

31:35.154 --> 31:37.678
- The internet says
that this is the best way

31:37.721 --> 31:38.722
to fix a dent.

31:38.766 --> 31:40.333
It is going to work.

31:40.376 --> 31:43.249
Vacuum on.

31:45.425 --> 31:47.296
Oh, my God!

31:50.343 --> 31:52.606
- It worked!
- I can't believe it!

31:57.524 --> 32:00.614
- Sup, ladies?
- Oh, hey.

32:00.657 --> 32:03.051
Uh, we're just--we're
just vacuuming out the rig.

32:03.095 --> 32:05.706
You know, a woman's work
is never done.

32:08.578 --> 32:10.450
all: Uh-huh, uh-huh.

32:10.493 --> 32:12.408
Yeah!

32:12.452 --> 32:14.454
- How bad is it?

32:14.497 --> 32:16.195
- Hard to say.

32:16.238 --> 32:17.805
I'm hoping it's just
a dead battery,

32:17.848 --> 32:21.287
but this bad boy took
a real beating in the crash.

32:21.330 --> 32:23.376
- There's not enough Purell
in the state of Illinois.

32:23.419 --> 32:25.247
I mean, the things that people
throw out their car window.

32:25.291 --> 32:26.335
What is that?

32:26.379 --> 32:27.467
- Oh, Cruz.

32:27.510 --> 32:29.338
- You call Chaffee?

32:29.382 --> 32:32.341
- Left a message,
haven't heard back yet.

32:32.385 --> 32:33.777
Getting anything?

32:33.821 --> 32:36.345
- Mm, gotta give it
some time to charge.

32:36.389 --> 32:38.260
Worse comes to worse
I can grab my reader

32:38.304 --> 32:40.393
and we could pull the footage
right off the microSD card.

32:40.436 --> 32:42.569
- All right, just be careful
not to screw anything up.

32:42.612 --> 32:44.484
- Mm-hmm.

32:44.527 --> 32:47.008
- I'd love to help,
but old guys like me

32:47.052 --> 32:50.446
don't know a micro card
from an AARP card.

32:50.490 --> 32:51.752
- Well, I guess I'll just have

32:51.795 --> 32:54.798
to get along
without you, Mouch.

33:02.763 --> 33:04.286
- What's wrong?

33:04.330 --> 33:05.331
- Oh, hey, Chief.

33:05.374 --> 33:06.810
No, nothing.
I'm good.

33:06.854 --> 33:08.682
- Sure you are.

33:08.725 --> 33:11.293
You've been moping around
for the last couple of shifts.

33:11.337 --> 33:13.643
- Man, nothing gets by you,
does it?

33:13.687 --> 33:16.124
- No, not in my firehouse.

33:16.168 --> 33:17.430
- Well, then you know
that Mouch and Otis

33:17.473 --> 33:18.779
have been
at each other's throats.

33:18.822 --> 33:21.434
- I do.

33:21.477 --> 33:23.479
- I look up to both of them.

33:23.523 --> 33:25.438
I mean, Mouch is the reason
I'm here.

33:25.481 --> 33:28.441
And if he leaves or retires--

33:28.484 --> 33:31.531
- Hopefully that's not
gonna happen.

33:31.574 --> 33:33.054
Look, Ritter,

33:33.098 --> 33:34.838
firehouse is a family
just like any other.

33:34.882 --> 33:37.798
We all know how to push
each other's buttons.

33:37.841 --> 33:41.715
You know, there's a good chance
this will just blow over.

33:41.758 --> 33:43.369
Sometimes all it takes
is ending up

33:43.412 --> 33:45.414
on the right side of a joke.

33:45.458 --> 33:47.329
Once they start to laugh
with each other

33:47.373 --> 33:49.723
instead of at each other,

33:49.766 --> 33:53.466
they'll forget
it ever happened.

33:53.509 --> 33:54.815
- Shazam!

33:54.858 --> 33:57.209
It's alive!

33:57.252 --> 33:59.341
- Go on.
- Anything survive?

33:59.385 --> 34:01.300
- Check it out.

34:01.343 --> 34:03.519
Here's the most recent
recording.

34:09.873 --> 34:12.528
- Can you skip ahead?

34:12.572 --> 34:14.182
- Yeah, getting close.

34:14.226 --> 34:16.358
Let it play.

34:17.620 --> 34:19.405
- Ooh.
all: Oh.

34:21.798 --> 34:23.931
- Oh, man.

34:26.281 --> 34:29.197
- Oh, my God.

34:29.241 --> 34:31.199
Oh, my God.

34:31.243 --> 34:33.419
Oh, my God.
Hey, are you okay?

34:33.462 --> 34:35.290
Hey, buddy, talk to me.

34:35.334 --> 34:37.292
21-13 Squad.

34:37.336 --> 34:38.772
Can you roll an ambulance?

34:38.815 --> 34:40.600
I've got an "on view"
traffic accident

34:40.643 --> 34:42.384
involving a motorcycle.

34:42.428 --> 34:43.777
Hang in there, buddy,
all right?

34:43.820 --> 34:45.300
I didn't see you.
I am so sorry.

34:45.344 --> 34:47.128
I'm so sorry.

34:47.172 --> 34:49.913
- Damn, that cop
got him killed.

34:57.965 --> 35:00.881
- Hey, are you okay?
Hey, buddy, talk to me.

35:03.188 --> 35:05.625
- I asked around
about you, Chaffee.

35:05.668 --> 35:09.890
You shine at the Academy,
spotless record on the force.

35:09.933 --> 35:11.587
What the hell happened here?

35:11.631 --> 35:14.112
- It was an accident.
I never saw him coming.

35:14.155 --> 35:15.722
- That was a stop sign.
- Yeah, I screwed up.

35:15.765 --> 35:17.637
I know that.
- And then you lied about it.

35:17.680 --> 35:19.160
- I wasn't planning to,
but then--

35:19.204 --> 35:21.031
- When the only witness died,
you figured,

35:21.075 --> 35:23.164
"Nobody needs to know
what really happened."

35:23.208 --> 35:24.774
- Accidents happen, Chaffee,

35:24.818 --> 35:26.602
but you had the chance
to make this right.

35:26.646 --> 35:28.343
And you blew it.

35:35.133 --> 35:37.047
- I'll take it from here.

35:40.747 --> 35:42.923
- Thanks, Antonio.

35:42.966 --> 35:45.230
Let me know
if you need anything, okay?

35:45.273 --> 35:47.797
- Appreciate it.
Thanks.

35:54.064 --> 35:55.805
- Police kept the video card
as evidence

35:55.849 --> 35:59.113
even though Chaffee confessed.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.985
- I don't want to watch it.

36:02.029 --> 36:04.205
Um, what happens to the cop?

36:04.249 --> 36:05.685
- I don't know if they're
gonna press charges,

36:05.728 --> 36:06.903
but you should talk
to a lawyer.

36:06.947 --> 36:08.775
- No, I'm not interested.

36:08.818 --> 36:11.038
- You don't have
to decide right now.

36:11.081 --> 36:13.214
- That's just not
who my dad was.

36:13.258 --> 36:15.869
That cop's got troubles enough.

36:15.912 --> 36:18.611
My dad would have
forgiven the guy.

36:18.654 --> 36:20.874
No, he always focused
on the good in people.

36:20.917 --> 36:24.356
That's why my sister and I
are focused on this.

36:24.399 --> 36:27.272
The, um, docs at Chicago Med

36:27.315 --> 36:28.925
gave us a list of all
the organ recipients

36:28.969 --> 36:31.232
that my dad was able to help.

36:31.276 --> 36:33.103
It's a youth
hockey league coach

36:33.147 --> 36:34.714
got my dad's heart.

36:34.757 --> 36:37.847
It's a sanitation worker
with three little kids

36:37.891 --> 36:39.762
who got his lungs.

36:39.806 --> 36:41.068
A high school student--

36:41.111 --> 36:43.244
he's the captain
of his robotics team--

36:43.288 --> 36:46.160
who's, um, been waiting
for a kidney...

36:47.814 --> 36:50.947
- That's a nice way
to remember him.

36:50.991 --> 36:52.775
- Yeah.

36:52.819 --> 36:56.083
Uh...

36:56.126 --> 36:59.826
thanks for getting us answers.

36:59.869 --> 37:01.958
- Yeah.
- Yeah, absolutely.

37:03.830 --> 37:06.136
- My dad would have
liked you guys.

37:06.180 --> 37:08.965
You're his kind of people.

37:09.009 --> 37:11.403
- Take care of yourself, Chris.

37:18.323 --> 37:21.151
- Thanks for bringing me in
on this one.

37:26.853 --> 37:29.725
- You guys had better be
at Chicago Trivia Night

37:29.769 --> 37:30.987
at Molly's, okay?

37:31.031 --> 37:32.162
Herrmann is serious
about this.

37:32.206 --> 37:34.164
- Dude.

37:34.208 --> 37:37.124
The dent where you knocked
into the traffic light is gone.

37:37.167 --> 37:38.430
- I didn't touch it.

37:38.473 --> 37:41.084
It must have popped out
on its own.

37:41.128 --> 37:43.348
- Wait, so you're telling me
I filled out

37:43.391 --> 37:45.306
all that paperwork for nothing?

37:57.275 --> 37:59.320
- Um...

37:59.364 --> 38:01.801
I am so sorry.

38:08.242 --> 38:09.417
Why are we sitting
all the way down here?

38:09.461 --> 38:11.332
- You know why.

38:11.376 --> 38:14.466
- But I won't be able to hear
the trivia questions.

38:14.509 --> 38:15.902
- Hey, guys.

38:15.945 --> 38:19.340
- Hey, Ritter.

38:19.384 --> 38:22.996
- I'm excited that
it's Chicago Trivia Night.

38:35.965 --> 38:37.053
- That's it.

38:37.097 --> 38:39.795
Enough of this crap, you two.

38:39.839 --> 38:43.233
Look at what he's willing
to do to himself

38:43.277 --> 38:46.193
just to get you two
on the same page!

38:46.236 --> 38:49.979
Look at how stupid he looks.

38:50.023 --> 38:52.895
- Guys, come on.
Grow up.

38:52.939 --> 38:54.462
You're brothers,
and you always will be,

38:54.506 --> 38:56.899
and you know that.

39:02.035 --> 39:03.384
- He looks like
a crafts project

39:03.428 --> 39:04.994
from third grade.

39:05.038 --> 39:06.909
- At a school
for the criminally insane.

39:14.961 --> 39:17.529
- Hey, hug it out, misfits.

39:17.572 --> 39:19.269
Hey, that's an order.

39:19.313 --> 39:21.315
- Go on.

39:21.359 --> 39:23.404
Go get 'im.
- Come on.

39:26.451 --> 39:28.148
- I wouldn't say
we're brothers.

39:28.191 --> 39:30.803
More like you're the grandpa
and I'm--

39:30.846 --> 39:32.892
Okay.

39:32.935 --> 39:35.460
Mouch...

39:35.503 --> 39:38.593
he's not the only one
you raised up in 51, man.

39:40.160 --> 39:42.423
You raised me up, too.

39:42.467 --> 39:44.425
Of course I'm gonna
give you hell for it.

39:44.469 --> 39:45.992
What do you want me to do?

39:46.035 --> 39:48.821
Cry and tell you
how much you mean to me?

39:48.864 --> 39:51.345
Come on, man.

39:51.389 --> 39:54.130
We're firefighters.

39:54.174 --> 39:57.133
- Appreciate that.

39:57.177 --> 40:00.876
And maybe once in a while--

40:00.920 --> 40:03.444
like when the television set
goes on the fritz--

40:03.488 --> 40:06.969
I'm thankful for your...

40:07.013 --> 40:08.971
geek brain.

40:09.015 --> 40:10.843
- Come here.

40:14.368 --> 40:17.458
- Good job.

40:17.502 --> 40:18.546
- Aww.

40:18.590 --> 40:20.069
I'm glad they worked it out.

40:20.113 --> 40:23.072
- Yeah.

40:27.555 --> 40:30.166
- What's he doing here?

40:30.210 --> 40:33.039
- You didn't invite him?
- No.

40:34.388 --> 40:37.130
- Hey, guys.
all: Hi.

40:40.350 --> 40:42.570
I'm not giving up so easy.

40:48.446 --> 40:50.622
- What was that about?

40:52.928 --> 40:55.888
- I'm not sure.
