01:44.104 --> 01:47.508
<i>This is Detective Mason Danvers.
My partner and I need backup. Over.</i>

01:47.608 --> 01:49.711
- <i>What location?</i>
- <i>Lynch Industries.</i>

01:49.811 --> 01:52.113
<i>We're in pursuit of Victor
and Griffin Abbott.</i>

01:52.213 --> 01:54.580
<i>Both are armed and dangerous. Over.</i>

02:02.588 --> 02:03.947
Clear.

02:32.052 --> 02:33.304
Crap.

03:02.815 --> 03:07.252
Come on, man. Don't make me
come in there looking for you.

03:07.887 --> 03:10.424
Just bought a new suit.

03:15.528 --> 03:19.131
Fine. We'll do it the hard way.

03:28.541 --> 03:30.512
I had him, you know.

03:30.612 --> 03:32.113
You okay?

03:32.213 --> 03:34.615
Yeah. Flesh wound.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.618
- Where's Victor?
- Running.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.885
Go. I got this one.

04:02.208 --> 04:04.759
Come on, Danvers!

04:11.384 --> 04:13.976
Isn't this what you want?

04:15.322 --> 04:18.692
To bring down
the infamous Victor Abbott?

04:18.791 --> 04:20.426
I'm right here!

05:05.973 --> 05:08.941
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

05:28.996 --> 05:32.071
What the hell are you laughing at?

05:33.199 --> 05:36.837
Hands on your head!
I said hands on your head!

05:36.937 --> 05:39.203
You lucky prick.

05:39.640 --> 05:42.506
- Damn it.
- On your knees.

05:49.716 --> 05:52.753
- You okay?
- So they tell me.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.889
Who was President the last time
you saw a doctor?

05:56.573 --> 05:57.992
Bush.

05:58.092 --> 06:00.060
Yeah, you should probably
get that checked out.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.362
Did they take care of Griffin?

06:01.462 --> 06:03.831
Yeah. Rolled him out of here
handcuffed to a stretcher.

06:03.931 --> 06:07.576
Just like his big brother here.
High-five, buddy.

06:07.676 --> 06:09.836
Maybe next time.

06:09.936 --> 06:12.240
<i>My ringer is off. Leave a message.</i>

06:12.340 --> 06:15.374
Hey, babe. I'm getting out
a little bit early today.

06:15.942 --> 06:17.229
I'll see you soon.

06:21.281 --> 06:24.415
I'll be seeing you real soon.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.421
Ready to roll?

06:28.360 --> 06:30.193
Mace?

06:30.490 --> 06:33.027
- You okay?
- Yeah.

06:35.362 --> 06:38.866
Real nice, Mace. Real nice.
Make the guy who got shot drive.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.265
I thought you were tough, pretty boy.

07:18.806 --> 07:21.142
- Oh, I hate it when you do that!
- Hey, hey, hey. Come on.

07:21.242 --> 07:23.374
Another page-turner?

07:23.474 --> 07:27.148
It's awful. Some woman
from work lent it to me.

07:27.248 --> 07:29.174
Seems like everyone
in the office is reading it.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.852
I don't understand how
they can read this crap.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.254
I must be some kind of freak
for not liking it.

07:34.354 --> 07:35.887
You're my freak.

07:36.956 --> 07:41.362
Why are you home early?
And what is that all about?

07:41.462 --> 07:44.132
- If you turned the ringer on your cell phone...
- Oh, forget it.

07:44.632 --> 07:47.837
- I don't care enough to be reprimanded.
- What do you want to do for dinner?

07:49.337 --> 07:54.639
I was thinking of making some
chicken enchiladas with rice and beans.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.875
- You lie.
- Yeah.

08:00.046 --> 08:03.847
He must have been pretty awful
to hold your attention for that long.

08:03.947 --> 08:07.552
- What did he do?
- What didn't he do?

08:07.820 --> 08:10.391
Drugs, racketeering,

08:10.491 --> 08:13.160
murder for hire, murder for fun.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.629
- Real bad guy, then?
- Real bad.

08:15.929 --> 08:20.100
- I guess it was worth the black eye.
- Definitely.

08:28.141 --> 08:32.110
- I've got some not so great news.
- What's that?

08:32.912 --> 08:35.379
I'm still not pregnant.

08:35.782 --> 08:38.121
Then we're gonna just...

08:38.583 --> 08:42.123
- Have to keep trying, won't we?
- Well, that is the fun part, so...

08:43.023 --> 08:45.030
It is the fun part.

08:50.296 --> 08:53.864
- Dessert?
- Yes, please.

08:56.436 --> 09:00.505
- Cookies or ice cream?
- Yes, please.

09:27.633 --> 09:29.480
Cocktails?

09:29.902 --> 09:33.140
I wish I could.
Bureaucratic process calls.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.341
You have fun with that.
Call me if you change your mind.

09:44.984 --> 09:49.323
Bad news. Bethwick from county called
about Victor and Griffin Abbott.

09:49.423 --> 09:53.694
She said some key witness
mysteriously went missing.

09:53.794 --> 09:56.462
They don't have enough
to still hold them for trial.

09:56.562 --> 10:00.134
Charges were dropped.
Both brothers walked this afternoon.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.185
Damn it!

10:31.030 --> 10:33.732
- <i>Joce?</i>
- Hey, baby.

11:14.740 --> 11:18.410
- Change your mind about that drink?
- Victor Abbott is inside my house!

11:22.148 --> 11:23.908
Hello, Mrs. Danvers.

11:28.625 --> 11:30.455
Help!

11:32.958 --> 11:35.257
You come here with me.

12:05.657 --> 12:08.828
Please. I'm pregnant.

12:16.135 --> 12:19.937
On the floor! I said on the floor now!

12:20.706 --> 12:22.560
Now!

12:31.651 --> 12:33.718
Joce?

12:40.026 --> 12:43.196
- Son of a bitch!
- Mason! He's not worth it.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.066
- He's not worth it, Mace.
- Drop your gun!

12:46.166 --> 12:47.832
Detective Danvers!

12:48.467 --> 12:51.038
Mace, listen to him.
You put that gun down, all right?

12:51.538 --> 12:52.871
You put that gun down!

12:53.973 --> 12:55.650
Now!

12:56.575 --> 12:58.819
Now, Mace.

13:04.083 --> 13:05.350
Let's go! Come on!

13:15.628 --> 13:18.599
<i>God, we thank you
for the life that you give us.</i>

13:18.699 --> 13:23.370
<i>It is full of work and responsibility,
sorrow and joy.</i>

13:23.470 --> 13:28.275
<i>Today we thank you for Jocelyn Danvers.</i>
<i>For what she's given and received.</i>

13:28.375 --> 13:31.311
<i>Help us in our mourning
and teach us to live for the living</i>

13:31.411 --> 13:33.704
<i>in the time that is still left to us.</i>

13:33.804 --> 13:35.846
<i>Let us pray.</i>

13:49.328 --> 13:51.195
Hey, Mace.

14:14.020 --> 14:17.071
Baldus said to take
as much time as you want.

14:20.226 --> 14:22.622
I want you to know...

14:23.362 --> 14:25.958
Anything you need, Mace.

14:26.058 --> 14:30.468
Anything. You just...
You say the word, all right?

14:37.309 --> 14:38.733
Here.

14:42.648 --> 14:44.470
Thanks.

15:00.299 --> 15:02.733
You did the right thing.

15:06.939 --> 15:09.406
There's nothing you could have done.

15:16.949 --> 15:19.675
So, are you going to take my advice?

15:19.986 --> 15:22.820
Get out of here? Clear your head?

15:25.825 --> 15:27.692
Yeah.

15:28.494 --> 15:30.261
I gotta get out of here.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.572
Good.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.765
Good. Where are you going to go?

15:38.204 --> 15:40.238
Hunting trip.

16:45.434 --> 16:47.173
<i>Hello?</i>

16:47.273 --> 16:50.710
Whatever I need. Right?

16:50.810 --> 16:52.977
<i>Of course.</i>

16:53.746 --> 16:57.283
3611 South 9th Place.

16:57.383 --> 16:59.205
<i>Mace...</i>

17:42.695 --> 17:45.598
- Yo, I need to see some beers.
- Where'd you get this?

17:45.698 --> 17:47.801
Where'd I get it, man?
That ain't none of your business.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.967
Hey!

17:52.321 --> 17:54.348
Oh, yeah.

17:55.330 --> 17:57.283
Don't.

17:57.810 --> 18:00.826
Well, if it isn't know-it-all cop.

18:07.019 --> 18:08.876
Drop it.

18:21.067 --> 18:23.111
You know why I'm here?

18:23.649 --> 18:25.469
Yeah.

18:26.273 --> 18:28.439
Because you don't have
a wife to go home to.

18:32.145 --> 18:35.049
Wrong fucking answer.

18:40.686 --> 18:42.689
Mace...

18:43.474 --> 18:45.522
What the hell?

19:32.938 --> 19:35.305
On your feet!

19:42.514 --> 19:47.551
One at a time, single file!
Just like in kindergarten.

19:51.690 --> 19:54.224
Fresh fish, Will!

19:56.595 --> 20:01.167
Hey! Yo! Yo, sonny! Look at me!
Look at me, man.

20:01.267 --> 20:04.070
You're mine! You hear me? You're mine!

20:04.170 --> 20:06.236
That's right.

20:22.654 --> 20:25.258
Welcome to Stonewall.

20:25.358 --> 20:28.395
Today you will receive
a medical evaluation.

20:28.895 --> 20:32.996
<i>You will strip down, shower,
and be issued a uniform.</i>

20:33.096 --> 20:35.602
<i>You will receive a cell assignment.</i>

20:35.702 --> 20:39.005
<i>You will meet your cellmate.
Get to know him.</i>

20:39.105 --> 20:43.040
<i>You will be spending
a lot of time together.</i>

21:03.595 --> 21:06.854
I am Oswald. Oz for short.

21:07.632 --> 21:08.802
Mason.

21:08.902 --> 21:12.841
Word is you used to be
some kind of hero cop.

21:13.305 --> 21:16.373
You've got an appointment, Danvers.

21:18.949 --> 21:20.044
Let's go.

21:43.655 --> 21:45.500
Enter.

21:50.942 --> 21:54.505
Mr. Danvers. Warden Snyder.

22:00.185 --> 22:02.222
Please have a seat.

22:02.322 --> 22:05.155
Thank you, Will. We'll be fine.

22:09.194 --> 22:10.902
Welcome to Stonewall.

22:11.397 --> 22:13.263
You're a bit of a celebrity now,
aren't you?

22:14.733 --> 22:16.900
Lauded by cops.

22:17.436 --> 22:19.703
Hated by criminals.

22:20.272 --> 22:22.039
But any press is good press, right?

22:23.742 --> 22:27.047
With that said, I feel very fortunate
to have you here.

22:27.147 --> 22:31.683
I mean, after all, you could have
ended up in any old prison.

22:31.783 --> 22:33.044
Am I right?

22:34.119 --> 22:36.963
I'm not judging, of course.
My motto has always been:

22:37.063 --> 22:40.227
"If you have strings to pull,
by all means, pull away."

22:40.727 --> 22:42.662
In fact, that brings me
to my first point.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.928
Stonewall can be a very...

22:46.265 --> 22:48.378
challenging place.

22:48.735 --> 22:51.601
Especially for an ex-cop like yourself.

22:52.371 --> 22:55.541
But I just wanted you to know
that you can count on me as an ally.

22:56.241 --> 22:58.611
My door is always open.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.780
In fact, as an initial
show of good faith,

23:00.880 --> 23:03.710
I've arranged for you
to work in the laundry.

23:04.283 --> 23:07.053
Now, I typically don't afford that type
of luxury for the new inmates,

23:07.153 --> 23:10.123
but it was very important for me

23:10.223 --> 23:13.089
that we started off on the right foot.

23:13.792 --> 23:16.860
After all, first impressions
are everything.

23:17.696 --> 23:19.713
Are they not?

23:21.500 --> 23:23.341
Yeah.

23:24.336 --> 23:26.504
Well, then. Will?

23:28.740 --> 23:30.808
Please escort Mr. Danvers
back to his cell.

23:35.046 --> 23:36.973
Mr. Danvers?

23:37.549 --> 23:39.382
It was my pleasure.

24:24.179 --> 24:27.196
Detective Danvers.

24:30.936 --> 24:33.303
Or should I say...

24:36.875 --> 24:38.285
inmate Danvers?

24:41.480 --> 24:43.847
How's that first meal treating you?

25:08.006 --> 25:09.691
Look...

25:09.791 --> 25:13.578
last time we saw each other
things were a little...

25:13.678 --> 25:17.491
tense. I mean, what...

25:17.891 --> 25:21.684
with you crying like a little bitch
over your wife's dead body.

25:23.322 --> 25:27.356
The last dead body I stood over
belonged to your brother.

25:35.334 --> 25:38.102
Well, the way I look at it,

25:39.671 --> 25:42.483
I still came out on top.

25:42.908 --> 25:46.843
I mean, after all, I did get two
for the price of one.

25:54.085 --> 25:57.155
Let's get one thing straight.

25:57.255 --> 26:00.025
This is my house.

26:00.125 --> 26:03.296
The only thing that badge
will get you in here

26:03.396 --> 26:06.429
is a slit throat.

26:36.895 --> 26:39.662
Hey! Yo! Keep going! Hey!

26:47.238 --> 26:49.489
Excuse me, Detective.

27:35.019 --> 27:36.514
Grab him.

27:36.614 --> 27:38.458
Look at me.

27:38.558 --> 27:40.223
I said look at me!

27:41.292 --> 27:43.242
Hey!

27:48.100 --> 27:50.169
This is C.O. Wilson. We have
an inmate down in the laundry.

27:50.269 --> 27:53.773
We need a med team in here!
Mason. Come on, Mason.

27:53.873 --> 27:56.639
Come on. Stay with me.

28:17.362 --> 28:18.756
He lives.

28:22.667 --> 28:24.537
Barely.

28:24.637 --> 28:29.172
You know, when they called me, I thought
I was gonna be identifying a body.

28:30.175 --> 28:32.242
You're lucky.

28:33.545 --> 28:37.514
Mace, that night you called me out
to Griffin's place,

28:38.783 --> 28:40.339
did you know how it would play out?

28:43.888 --> 28:47.023
I called you because you're a good cop.

28:47.792 --> 28:49.859
Mason,

28:50.729 --> 28:52.396
this isn't gonna bring her back.

28:55.500 --> 28:57.567
I know.

29:36.474 --> 29:38.578
Ben Wilson?

29:40.745 --> 29:43.181
What are you doing in here?

29:43.281 --> 29:45.884
I've been here since I quit the force.

29:45.984 --> 29:48.354
It isn't too demanding.

29:48.454 --> 29:50.766
You get stuck doing a lot of stuff,
like keeping an eye on guys

29:50.866 --> 29:52.512
who end up in a pool of their own blood.

29:54.125 --> 29:57.397
- It wasn't exactly a fair fight.
- Oh, it never is.

29:57.497 --> 30:01.230
Especially when the other side
of that fight is coming from Victor Abbott.

30:03.535 --> 30:05.938
So, Abbott is running things
inside here?

30:06.038 --> 30:08.051
Oh, he's running things
in here and out there.

30:09.041 --> 30:11.628
He's built quite the network
for himself over the years.

30:13.678 --> 30:16.212
And the two lap dogs?

30:17.645 --> 30:18.866
Middle management.

30:19.884 --> 30:21.888
<i>Drexel's in charge of sales.</i>

30:21.988 --> 30:25.191
<i>You need something within
these walls, Drexel delivers.</i>

30:25.291 --> 30:28.027
<i>He doesn't care
about skin or gang colors.</i>

30:28.127 --> 30:31.064
<i>The only color he cares about is green.</i>

30:31.164 --> 30:35.233
<i>And Stonewall is full
of paying customers.</i>

30:35.333 --> 30:38.571
<i>Booker? Well, he's head
of human resources.</i>

30:38.871 --> 30:44.516
<i>When Victor needs to hand out a pink slip,
Booker delivers the bad news.</i>

30:50.615 --> 30:53.250
<i>Abbott's been in Stonewall
for less than a year.</i>

30:54.954 --> 30:57.023
How did he grab control so quickly?

30:57.123 --> 31:01.126
<i>You get enough blood on your hands,
eventually people give you what you want.</i>

31:01.226 --> 31:03.166
<i>After that,</i>

31:03.266 --> 31:05.792
<i>they do your dirty work for you.</i>

31:06.232 --> 31:09.900
<i>Doesn't matter where you are,
in here, out there,</i>

31:11.402 --> 31:14.999
- <i>it is all the same to them.</i>
- Bitch.

31:19.944 --> 31:23.182
If that's true, then why would Victor
risk getting thrown back inside?

31:23.282 --> 31:25.953
He was out. Completely in the clear.

31:27.253 --> 31:31.020
When they sent Victor back to Stonewall,
they didn't lock him up.

31:32.090 --> 31:34.737
They just put a fortress around him.

31:35.259 --> 31:39.264
- This is where he thrives.
- Time's up, Danvers.

31:42.367 --> 31:44.762
Good seeing you again, Ben.

31:45.699 --> 31:47.706
Hey, Mason?

31:47.806 --> 31:51.774
Abbott may be the body of the snake,
but he's not the head.

31:52.377 --> 31:54.097
Do yourself a favor and remember that.

31:56.077 --> 31:58.969
- Will do.
- Danvers!

32:06.891 --> 32:09.193
So, you've healed?

32:09.293 --> 32:10.588
Enough.

32:12.030 --> 32:14.466
That's good to hear.

32:15.333 --> 32:19.297
Mob mentality and vendettas
have no place in my prison.

32:19.672 --> 32:24.877
Eventually those responsible
for your current state

32:24.977 --> 32:27.273
will be discovered.

32:27.680 --> 32:31.946
And I promise you,
they will be dealt with properly.

32:34.319 --> 32:38.648
Anyway, welcome back
to general population.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.014
<i>Hey, Mason?</i>

33:38.114 --> 33:41.654
<i>Abbott may be the body of the snake,
but he's not the head.</i>

33:41.754 --> 33:43.890
<i>Do yourself a favor and remember that.</i>

34:10.047 --> 34:13.514
<i>So, what's so urgent I had
to get down here immediately?</i>

34:14.185 --> 34:15.955
<i>You remember Ben Wilson?</i>

34:16.855 --> 34:19.576
<i>Ben Wilson? Yeah, vaguely.</i>

34:20.558 --> 34:22.828
<i>Well, he's working here now.</i>

34:22.928 --> 34:26.464
<i>He said something to me
the other day in passing.</i>

34:26.563 --> 34:27.908
<i>It just didn't sit right.</i>

34:28.900 --> 34:31.148
<i>Yeah, what's that?</i>

34:32.370 --> 34:37.275
<i>I want you to find out how many people
have walked from Stonewall early.</i>

34:37.376 --> 34:39.978
<i>Abbott's not in this alone.</i>

34:40.079 --> 34:44.313
<i>Victor could not have free reign
without someone like Snyder.</i>

34:50.755 --> 34:53.712
Why must everyone disappoint me?

36:34.725 --> 36:36.917
You're done.

37:02.794 --> 37:04.853
Hey.

37:13.465 --> 37:16.320
You ain't so bad without your boys?

37:22.344 --> 37:24.216
Get up!

37:42.360 --> 37:44.663
- Yo, you heard about Flynn?
- What about him?

37:44.763 --> 37:46.504
Bet you it was Danvers.

37:51.536 --> 37:54.086
I just heard some stuff.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.550
Marco's dead.

38:15.650 --> 38:17.942
I know. Flynn, too.

38:19.530 --> 38:21.200
What?

38:21.300 --> 38:24.266
Guards found him in the kitchen
with a broken neck.

38:24.366 --> 38:26.935
Son of a bitch.

38:29.240 --> 38:31.188
So?

38:32.009 --> 38:35.444
- What are we gonna do?
- You aren't gonna do anything.

38:36.347 --> 38:38.715
But I'm next, Vic.

38:42.686 --> 38:45.210
And I'll deal with it.

39:11.716 --> 39:14.249
You hear about Flynn and Marco?

39:15.853 --> 39:18.256
Whole yard's whispering.

39:18.356 --> 39:19.577
Think it's our friend?

39:20.524 --> 39:21.944
It appears that way.

39:24.595 --> 39:26.923
Seems a little above
his pay grade, don't you think?

39:28.032 --> 39:30.813
Flynn and Marco?

39:31.403 --> 39:35.704
Those two were a couple of spoons
in a drawer full of knives.

39:36.741 --> 39:38.992
Fair enough.

39:40.711 --> 39:43.603
You should arrange for another reminder.

39:45.883 --> 39:49.771
Make sure this one
is a little more direct.

39:54.992 --> 39:56.695
Get up!

39:56.795 --> 39:58.994
I'm here to deliver a message.

40:26.858 --> 40:28.341
Message received!

40:34.499 --> 40:37.427
You've created quite
a predicament for me.

40:38.502 --> 40:41.546
Oh, what to do, what to do?

40:43.007 --> 40:45.144
You nearly killed a man.

40:45.244 --> 40:49.111
With a sink, no less.
That's very, very impressive.

40:49.647 --> 40:52.585
And while I can quietly admire
your feat inside this office,

40:53.185 --> 40:57.942
I cannot allow it to go unchecked
inside this prison.

40:58.889 --> 41:02.850
Maybe we can come up with an arrangement
that would be mutually beneficial.

41:04.029 --> 41:06.631
Would that interest you, Mr. Danvers?

41:07.665 --> 41:08.980
No.

41:10.534 --> 41:13.101
Well, that is a shame.

41:17.141 --> 41:18.561
We're done here.

41:19.277 --> 41:21.053
Will?

41:23.014 --> 41:26.060
Take Mr. Danvers to the hole. One week.

41:26.160 --> 41:28.189
Let's go.

41:29.186 --> 41:35.203
I'm curious, do you have a mutually
beneficial agreement with Victor Abbott?

42:22.493 --> 42:24.306
Hey.

42:27.178 --> 42:29.715
- How are you holding up?
- I'll survive.

42:30.315 --> 42:33.164
Who the hell hits someone with a sink?

42:34.184 --> 42:39.024
You guys should watch yourselves, though.
That cat, he ain't playing around.

42:40.758 --> 42:42.796
Neither are we.

42:43.494 --> 42:45.793
So what you thinking?

42:46.630 --> 42:48.715
We done playing?

42:50.434 --> 42:53.105
Are you giving orders now?

42:53.205 --> 42:55.717
No, man. I'm just wondering how much
damage this punk's got to do

42:55.817 --> 42:57.144
before we take him out.

43:01.645 --> 43:03.147
Look,

43:03.247 --> 43:06.484
I need Snyder on board
before we retire Danvers.

43:07.052 --> 43:09.785
Now, we got a good thing
going on in here.

43:10.955 --> 43:13.525
We don't need our business going public.

43:13.625 --> 43:18.160
He's cut off in here.
Who's gonna notice if he goes missing?

43:43.588 --> 43:46.321
You're back in the laundry tomorrow.

45:08.072 --> 45:09.712
What?

45:10.474 --> 45:12.779
I need a favor.

45:33.430 --> 45:35.314
Hey.

45:36.033 --> 45:37.477
Victor's looking for you.

45:39.870 --> 45:41.957
Yeah?

45:42.257 --> 45:45.319
- Where's he at?
- He's in your cell.

45:46.644 --> 45:49.558
I wouldn't keep him waiting.

45:53.517 --> 45:56.885
Yo, Vic? That old, fat prick
said you were looking for me?

46:00.757 --> 46:03.024
Leaving already?

46:04.728 --> 46:06.943
But you just got here.

46:10.701 --> 46:13.381
You fucking shut up! Shut up!

46:39.564 --> 46:41.433
Enter.

46:45.302 --> 46:47.599
You've got a visitor.

46:48.272 --> 46:49.781
Abbott wants to see you.

46:53.678 --> 46:56.944
If it's not one thing, it's another.

46:57.547 --> 46:59.808
Let him in.

47:06.891 --> 47:07.941
Victor. It's so...

47:08.041 --> 47:11.953
My patience is running
real thin with Danvers.

47:14.464 --> 47:16.498
Sit.

47:30.814 --> 47:32.451
Now, you were saying?

47:32.551 --> 47:35.287
- He's killed three men.
- Yes.

47:35.387 --> 47:38.123
And I told you,
you are not to touch him.

47:38.223 --> 47:41.693
There's too much heat. He's a cop
and a celebrated one at that.

47:41.793 --> 47:45.427
And I don't need that kind of attention.
It's bad for business.

47:46.430 --> 47:51.169
This whole cat and mouse game
is getting really old with Danvers.

47:51.269 --> 47:52.704
Now, I don't know how he got in here...

47:52.804 --> 47:56.871
You really don't know how
he got into Stonewall, do you?

47:58.041 --> 48:00.108
Think.

48:04.748 --> 48:06.760
You let him in.

48:06.860 --> 48:08.920
Not exactly.

48:09.020 --> 48:11.526
He certainly has friends
in the right places, but...

48:11.626 --> 48:15.342
I do have final say
over who lives under my roof.

48:16.760 --> 48:19.066
Are you insane?

48:21.198 --> 48:23.401
He's here on a rampage.

48:23.501 --> 48:26.303
And why would that bother me?

48:26.403 --> 48:28.770
We had a deal.

48:33.543 --> 48:35.583
Say that again.

48:35.683 --> 48:38.875
We... had...

48:38.975 --> 48:42.717
a... deal.

48:42.817 --> 48:45.086
Had.

48:45.255 --> 48:50.529
We had a deal and that deal was contingent
on you being on the outside. Remember?

48:50.629 --> 48:54.698
I arrange for a witness
to disappear and you walk.

48:54.798 --> 48:58.068
And you repay that kindness with half...

48:58.168 --> 49:02.645
of whatever business
you do... out there.

49:03.306 --> 49:05.275
Not in here.

49:05.375 --> 49:07.409
You...

49:08.712 --> 49:11.991
are of no use to me in here.

49:17.100 --> 49:19.591
- But...
- But nothing.

49:19.691 --> 49:22.027
Revenge was more important
to you than business.

49:22.127 --> 49:24.496
And that reflects poorly on me.

49:24.596 --> 49:29.130
And I can't allow that to go unnoticed.

49:40.077 --> 49:42.064
However...

49:42.780 --> 49:45.497
There may be an opportunity
for you to redeem yourself.

50:06.536 --> 50:07.872
Hello?

50:07.972 --> 50:10.334
- <i>Detective Gainer?</i>
- Speaking.

50:10.434 --> 50:13.721
- <i>Joel Gainer?</i>
- Yeah. Who is this?

50:13.821 --> 50:17.282
<i>This is prison medical
from Stonewall Correctional Center.</i>

50:17.382 --> 50:21.086
<i>One of our inmates, a Mason Danvers,</i>

50:21.186 --> 50:26.180
<i>unfortunately, he was found beaten
to death in his cell earlier this evening.</i>

50:26.791 --> 50:29.961
<i>Mr. Danvers listed you
as his emergency contact.</i>

50:30.361 --> 50:33.867
I'm calling because we'd appreciate it
if you could come in and identify the body.

50:36.867 --> 50:38.806
Yeah. I'll be right over.

50:48.979 --> 50:52.460
Thanks for coming
on such short notice, Officer.

50:55.953 --> 50:57.226
Hello, Officer.

50:58.223 --> 51:01.479
Thank you for coming out
to identify the body.

51:11.201 --> 51:13.110
Well.

51:13.704 --> 51:15.040
Let's get this show on the road.

51:19.643 --> 51:21.809
Get your hands off of him!

51:21.912 --> 51:23.648
I'm right here! I'm here.

51:23.748 --> 51:26.284
Now, now, now, now.

51:26.384 --> 51:29.420
You wanna help your boy?
Go help your boy.

51:38.161 --> 51:41.131
Always one second too late, aren't you?

52:09.726 --> 52:11.793
Enter.

52:20.103 --> 52:22.005
It's done.

52:22.105 --> 52:23.976
Good.

52:24.076 --> 52:26.401
Thank you, Lester.

52:26.501 --> 52:28.800
Dump the body.

52:58.808 --> 53:00.675
What?

53:02.045 --> 53:05.742
Some colleagues are nervous
about staying involved.

53:06.917 --> 53:09.588
Saying shit is just too hot right now.

53:09.688 --> 53:11.957
They think Danvers is burning
a path straight to you.

53:12.357 --> 53:14.508
And that he'll run over
anyone who gets in his way.

53:15.526 --> 53:18.593
There's also whispers
about him having help.

53:19.663 --> 53:22.129
Silent partner?

53:25.368 --> 53:27.370
Snyder.

53:27.770 --> 53:29.837
No.

53:30.607 --> 53:32.286
Snyder and I are square.

53:33.210 --> 53:34.858
You sure about that, Vic?

53:35.879 --> 53:37.849
We got guys talking big.

53:37.949 --> 53:40.876
Saying they're gonna make
a play for power.

53:42.152 --> 53:44.440
They think you're losing it, Vic.

53:44.540 --> 53:46.257
It's this cop.

53:46.357 --> 53:49.344
He's got up all in your head,
making you act all...

53:54.330 --> 53:57.670
Regardless, loyalties are strained.

54:47.184 --> 54:48.773
Hey!

54:49.519 --> 54:52.499
- What does he want?
- He won't say.

54:53.423 --> 54:55.289
Well, then bring him in.

55:11.041 --> 55:13.719
Tell me more about this mutually
beneficial arrangement.

55:15.045 --> 55:17.212
Wait outside.

55:28.792 --> 55:31.125
What do you want from me?

55:32.362 --> 55:34.490
Sit.

55:42.205 --> 55:44.474
What does anyone want?

55:44.574 --> 55:46.644
A helping hand.

55:46.744 --> 55:49.714
Running a prison
is tougher than it looks.

55:49.814 --> 55:55.187
It's hard maintaining order in a place
filled with so much filth and chaos.

55:56.287 --> 56:00.307
Most times, rules and regulations
maintain that order.

56:00.407 --> 56:02.823
But sometimes,

56:03.293 --> 56:05.916
this job requires...

56:06.316 --> 56:08.442
other tactics.

56:10.700 --> 56:13.022
That's where you come in.

56:14.738 --> 56:17.759
- Killing people.
- Oh, you make it sound so sinister.

56:19.109 --> 56:21.379
Don't be so dramatic, Danvers.

56:21.779 --> 56:25.450
You act as if I'm asking you to do something
you don't feel comfortable with.

56:25.550 --> 56:28.983
Clearly, your track record
speaks otherwise.

56:33.623 --> 56:35.690
Why me?

56:38.028 --> 56:40.740
You have the skills of a cop

56:40.840 --> 56:43.959
and the constitution
of a cold-blooded killer.

56:44.335 --> 56:46.148
What better combination could there be?

56:47.729 --> 56:52.048
Besides, I think we both can agree that we
share at least one common goal, don't we?

56:54.411 --> 56:57.147
Out with the old, in with the new,

56:57.247 --> 56:59.234
and all that.

56:59.334 --> 57:01.449
Am I right?

57:02.549 --> 57:05.120
Let's shake and make it official.

57:08.725 --> 57:10.840
First, I need something from you.

57:12.996 --> 57:15.137
Well, well.

57:19.402 --> 57:20.950
Do tell.

57:31.504 --> 57:32.883
What?

57:32.983 --> 57:35.976
You have a meeting with the warden.

57:36.653 --> 57:40.223
- It's the middle of the night.
- Then you take it up with him.

57:54.838 --> 57:56.741
What're we doing in here?

57:56.841 --> 57:59.931
The warden wants to have a word.

58:00.877 --> 58:03.201
What's it about?

58:04.048 --> 58:07.480
I'm just the deliveryman, Booker.

58:25.468 --> 58:28.829
Yo, man. What's with the secret meeting?

58:38.852 --> 58:40.793
What did you...

58:40.893 --> 58:44.662
What did you inject me with?

58:54.831 --> 58:56.527
Don't try to talk.

58:57.027 --> 58:59.600
Don't try to scream.

59:00.803 --> 59:03.070
'Cause you can't.

59:03.473 --> 59:04.891
Stressful, isn't it?

59:06.909 --> 59:09.210
Sitting there.

59:09.546 --> 59:11.358
Unable to move.

59:12.949 --> 59:16.454
Not sure what the hell
is going to happen next.

59:18.121 --> 59:21.088
Just like my wife felt...

59:21.658 --> 59:26.195
when Victor Abbott stood over her

59:26.295 --> 59:29.135
and bashed in her head.

59:48.818 --> 59:51.061
Don't look at me.

59:56.826 --> 59:58.793
You'll miss the show.

01:00:56.787 --> 01:00:58.489
Danvers dies now!

01:00:58.589 --> 01:01:01.422
- Sorry, he just...
- We're fine.

01:01:08.364 --> 01:01:10.297
Sit.

01:01:21.077 --> 01:01:22.780
Now what's wrong?

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:26.372
Does someone need a hug
because their friend bled out?

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:30.587
You are aligned with him.

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:33.287
I should have listened to Booker.

01:01:33.623 --> 01:01:36.460
Well, at least you won't have a chance
to make the same mistake twice.

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:39.396
Why are you doing this?

01:01:39.496 --> 01:01:41.851
You're being traded in
for a newer model.

01:01:43.132 --> 01:01:45.269
No! Will! Will!

01:01:45.369 --> 01:01:47.474
I should kill you right now.

01:01:51.146 --> 01:01:53.827
- This ain't over yet.
- Yes.

01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:16.763
There's your boy.

01:02:20.036 --> 01:02:22.005
I don't know, Vic.

01:02:22.105 --> 01:02:24.239
I don't care.

01:02:25.274 --> 01:02:27.399
He dies now.

01:02:27.977 --> 01:02:29.010
Here we go.

01:02:37.855 --> 01:02:39.890
On your bellies, now! Now!

01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:42.482
Get down!

01:02:42.782 --> 01:02:46.346
<i>Repeat. All prisoners in their cells.</i>

01:02:46.446 --> 01:02:48.462
Get down!

01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:06.848
I heard about your little incident
in the cafeteria.

01:03:08.651 --> 01:03:11.853
I had to get out of Dodge.
That was the quickest way.

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:16.360
You broke Artie's nose, you know.

01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:19.594
That was the name
of the guard you hit. Artie.

01:03:20.597 --> 01:03:22.933
Tell Artie it wasn't personal.

01:03:23.033 --> 01:03:26.167
Yeah. He's kind of a prick anyway.

01:03:32.141 --> 01:03:34.805
You mind if I ask
what you're trying to do here?

01:03:36.812 --> 01:03:38.732
What do you mean?

01:03:38.832 --> 01:03:40.918
All of it.

01:03:41.018 --> 01:03:45.975
Punching guards.
Spending time in the hole. Why?

01:03:49.325 --> 01:03:51.294
You know what they say
about you in here, don't you?

01:03:53.596 --> 01:03:57.469
Yeah, they say you're truly crazy
and they don't want any part of it.

01:03:57.969 --> 01:04:03.059
Although, I think some of them
are silently rooting for you.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:08.478
Well, what about you, Ben?
Are you rooting for me?

01:04:11.047 --> 01:04:14.381
I haven't picked sides
since the seventh grade.

01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:16.862
That's why I'm still alive today.

01:04:17.954 --> 01:04:20.891
You keep smoking those things,
you may not be alive tomorrow.

01:04:21.791 --> 01:04:24.022
You're probably right.

01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:31.389
If they ask where that came from,
don't rat on me, all right?

01:04:32.735 --> 01:04:33.886
All right.

01:04:35.972 --> 01:04:37.671
Here.

01:04:41.678 --> 01:04:43.451
Keep that in return for your silence.

01:04:45.782 --> 01:04:49.751
That was you in the laundry
that day, wasn't it?

01:04:51.921 --> 01:04:53.262
Might have been.

01:04:55.859 --> 01:04:59.726
If it was you that saved
my ass that day,

01:05:01.363 --> 01:05:02.734
thank you.

01:05:04.834 --> 01:05:09.707
Well, if it was me,
I'd tell you you're welcome.

01:05:10.307 --> 01:05:13.848
Otherwise I'd think you were
probably looking for it.

01:05:15.478 --> 01:05:17.493
Ben?

01:05:19.516 --> 01:05:22.377
If it comes down to it...

01:05:22.977 --> 01:05:24.221
can you do it?

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:30.059
Do what?

01:05:30.159 --> 01:05:31.841
Pick sides.

01:05:35.398 --> 01:05:36.805
You take care of yourself.

01:06:22.512 --> 01:06:26.780
I apologize that you've had
to spend some time down here.

01:06:29.418 --> 01:06:34.855
After all, it was all about maintaining
appearances, am I right?

01:06:35.892 --> 01:06:38.098
Indeed, I am.

01:06:40.096 --> 01:06:43.000
I heard you put on quite a show.

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:45.569
Still, while we have an agreement,
I can't have you...

01:06:45.669 --> 01:06:47.541
We have no agreement.

01:06:52.842 --> 01:06:54.911
Excuse me?

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:57.972
I don't need you anymore.

01:07:05.354 --> 01:07:09.511
Did you make that boy bleed out
onto the floor all by yourself?

01:07:09.611 --> 01:07:12.058
I don't think so.

01:07:13.963 --> 01:07:19.068
Victor Abbott may have killed my wife,

01:07:19.168 --> 01:07:23.470
but we both know who let him out.

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:27.368
As long as you're in charge,
people like him are gonna continue

01:07:27.468 --> 01:07:31.048
walking out of here
every time we put 'em in.

01:07:31.148 --> 01:07:35.869
- Are you threatening me?
- Do you feel threatened?

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:43.823
You're a dead man, Danvers.

01:07:43.923 --> 01:07:47.370
- You know that, right?
- From day one.

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:40.947
I believe an apology is in order.

01:08:42.917 --> 01:08:44.131
So...

01:09:06.341 --> 01:09:08.908
Go on.

01:09:23.559 --> 01:09:25.626
Danvers.

01:09:31.868 --> 01:09:34.986
I placed an official transfer request
for you this morning.

01:09:36.772 --> 01:09:40.576
Once the superintendent
approves it, and he will,

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:43.977
your time in Stonewall will be up.

01:09:44.246 --> 01:09:46.566
And your little game...

01:09:47.166 --> 01:09:49.428
will be over.

01:09:51.754 --> 01:09:54.656
Take this shit back to his cell.

01:09:54.991 --> 01:09:57.524
Let's go, Danvers.

01:10:32.695 --> 01:10:34.166
I have information.

01:10:41.303 --> 01:10:43.107
Word is you're transferring out?

01:10:43.607 --> 01:10:46.484
Seems to be a popular topic
of conversation these days.

01:10:51.313 --> 01:10:53.724
Abbott's been having
meetings on the roof.

01:10:55.151 --> 01:10:57.287
Seems him and Drexel

01:10:57.387 --> 01:11:00.121
have an even earlier
exit plan scheduled for you.

01:11:02.591 --> 01:11:04.229
They...

01:11:04.329 --> 01:11:08.531
meet in the mornings
before the guards start their shifts.

01:11:08.631 --> 01:11:10.443
Everyone knows to stay clear.

01:11:12.034 --> 01:11:14.938
Drexel's alone up there right now.

01:11:15.638 --> 01:11:16.685
That help?

01:11:18.006 --> 01:11:20.017
Maybe.

01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:23.477
Thanks.

01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:00.302
You're so bad you gotta
sneak up on a brother?

01:12:30.245 --> 01:12:32.486
Hold him up.

01:13:03.612 --> 01:13:06.326
Don't fucking move!

01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:11.684
What are you doing?

01:13:12.288 --> 01:13:13.552
- Open the door.
- What?

01:13:13.652 --> 01:13:17.604
- Open the door!
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:13:28.304 --> 01:13:31.379
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!

01:13:35.811 --> 01:13:38.271
- What the hell's going on up there?
- Keep moving, ladies.

01:13:38.371 --> 01:13:39.816
- Come on, you don't hear that?
- Keep moving!

01:13:39.916 --> 01:13:41.991
No! No, no! No! No!

01:13:57.467 --> 01:13:59.487
What!

01:14:15.417 --> 01:14:18.752
Stonewall to base!
We've got a riot in the yard!

01:14:18.854 --> 01:14:22.435
Inmates are armed! I repeat.
Inmates are armed!

01:14:34.570 --> 01:14:37.040
- You did this.
- I did.

01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:40.063
Right after I dropped Drexel
off the roof.

01:14:40.163 --> 01:14:42.462
- Will!
- On top of Will.

01:14:42.562 --> 01:14:43.813
You lie!

01:14:43.913 --> 01:14:46.483
I don't see him
rushing in here to save you.

01:14:46.583 --> 01:14:48.915
Guards!

01:14:55.758 --> 01:14:59.172
Take him outside and put a bullet in the
back of his head. Do I make myself clear?

01:14:59.272 --> 01:15:01.561
Yes, sir.

01:15:16.805 --> 01:15:18.456
Danvers!

01:16:14.771 --> 01:16:18.439
You really wanna know what it felt like
to be your wife that night?

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:26.846
Let me show you.

01:16:37.493 --> 01:16:39.759
Follow me.

01:16:56.111 --> 01:16:57.807
You're done, Mr. Danvers.

01:17:00.248 --> 01:17:02.452
This all could have been avoided.

01:17:02.552 --> 01:17:05.020
I want you to remember that
when you die.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.256
Victor?

01:17:07.356 --> 01:17:09.805
I'll let you do the honors.

01:17:10.692 --> 01:17:12.746
And don't screw it up this time.

01:17:16.231 --> 01:17:17.250
Do it!

01:17:18.450 --> 01:17:19.478
Do it!

01:17:20.702 --> 01:17:22.718
He helped me kill Booker.

01:17:24.039 --> 01:17:26.854
He threw Drexel off the roof.

01:17:37.386 --> 01:17:40.121
This is my house you've been living in.

01:17:40.221 --> 01:17:43.274
It always has been since the day
I came to Stonewall.

01:18:19.895 --> 01:18:22.234
Now, where did we leave off?

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:30.737
Right about here.

01:20:11.473 --> 01:20:13.688
You drop them!

01:20:15.177 --> 01:20:17.310
You don't wanna do that.

01:20:17.412 --> 01:20:18.982
Drop them.

01:20:19.082 --> 01:20:21.973
Okay. Fine.

01:20:27.055 --> 01:20:29.104
No.

01:20:31.727 --> 01:20:35.857
That's for Gainer, you son of a bitch.

01:20:55.483 --> 01:20:57.447
Of course.

01:21:43.932 --> 01:21:46.625
- Help me, Vic.
- Ammo.

01:22:23.505 --> 01:22:25.208
Look at me.

01:22:25.308 --> 01:22:27.785
I said look at me!

01:22:29.844 --> 01:22:31.986
Attaboy.

01:22:32.714 --> 01:22:35.681
I want you to see this coming.

01:22:36.051 --> 01:22:39.218
Say hi to your wife and kid for me.

01:23:26.134 --> 01:23:27.608
Goodbye, Mr. Danvers.

01:23:30.372 --> 01:23:33.122
I don't think I can let you
do that, Warden! Drop it!

01:23:36.044 --> 01:23:38.948
- What is it you think you're doing?
- They're placing you under arrest.

01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:41.749
For what?

01:23:41.849 --> 01:23:43.219
For what!

01:23:43.319 --> 01:23:47.461
Extortion. Murder.
A little bit of everything.

01:23:49.457 --> 01:23:50.893
You picked a side.

01:23:50.993 --> 01:23:53.827
Yeah, well. It seemed like
as good a time as any.

01:23:55.170 --> 01:23:56.765
Hey, Warden?

01:23:57.265 --> 01:23:58.940
See you soon.
