WEBVTT

00:53.454 --> 00:56.724
THIS WAY, CHIEF.

00:56.757 --> 00:59.460
INCLUDING THE YOUNG WOMAN
FROM LAST NIGHT,

00:59.493 --> 01:01.595
HOLLYWOOD HAS DUG UP
THREE FEMALES,

01:01.629 --> 01:05.233
AND THE CADAVER DOGS THINK
THAT THERE'S AT LEAST TWO MORE.

01:05.266 --> 01:07.768
HERE, WATCH YOUR STEP.
WATCH YOUR STEP, THERE.

01:07.801 --> 01:11.772
I UNDERSTAND THE 911 CALL
CAME IN AT 10:26 LAST NIGHT.

01:11.805 --> 01:13.774
WHY THE LAG TIME
IN OUR RESPONSE?

01:13.807 --> 01:16.877
THE BOY WAS ASKED WHERE HE'D
SEEN THE WOMAN BEING BURIED.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.147
HE ONLY SAID IT WAS ABOVE
THE GREEK THEATRE --

01:19.180 --> 01:21.182
A LARGE AREA
TO COVER IN THE DARK.

01:21.215 --> 01:22.683
AND HE REFUSED TO I.D.
HIMSELF,

01:22.716 --> 01:24.585
SO SOME PEOPLE
THOUGHT IT WAS A PRANK.

01:24.618 --> 01:27.455
Tao: THIS IS THE CELLPHONE
USED TO DIAL 911.

01:27.488 --> 01:29.723
THE KID DUMPED IT
IN A TRASH BIN ON VERMONT.

01:29.757 --> 01:30.858
WHOSE NUMBER IS IT?

01:30.891 --> 01:32.593
GOES BACK
TO A DOUGLAS GRAND.

01:32.626 --> 01:35.196
HE'S A REAL-ESTATE AGENT.
REPORTED IT STOLEN LAST NIGHT.

01:35.229 --> 01:38.199
HERE IT IS.
WHAT AN AMAZING COINCIDENCE.

01:38.232 --> 01:39.800
Flynn: YEAH, PATROL'S
PICKING MR. GRAND UP

01:39.833 --> 01:42.236
SO WE CAN DISCUSS
JUST HOW LUCKY HE IS.

01:43.771 --> 01:47.141
UGH. STRANGLED, RAPED,
BURIED NAKED.

01:47.175 --> 01:49.710
HER CLOTHES RIPPED UP
AND DUMPED ON TOP OF HER

01:49.743 --> 01:50.811
LIKE THE OTHER VICTIMS.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.248
UNLIKE THEM,
SHE HASN'T DECOMPOSED YET.

01:54.282 --> 01:56.817
AND SHE WAS BURIED
WITH A PURSE.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.852
Provenza:
KILLER WAS INTERRUPTED.

01:58.886 --> 02:00.788
DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO DISPOSE
OF THE VICTIM'S THINGS

02:00.821 --> 02:02.256
IN THE USUAL WAY.

02:02.290 --> 02:05.159
Gabriel: SAYS HERE
HER NAME IS KAREN ONCIDI.

02:05.193 --> 02:07.828
SHE'S A SENIOR AT UCLA,
22 YEARS OLD.

02:07.861 --> 02:11.165
SHE'S GOT AN IOWA
DRIVER'S LICENSE.

02:11.199 --> 02:13.301
TIME OF DEATH?

02:13.334 --> 02:15.703
BETWEEN 8:30 AND 10:30,
IN THAT AREA.

02:19.540 --> 02:22.243
UGH. PUT THE DUCT TAPE
ON HER MOUTH.

02:22.943 --> 02:27.248
ABRASIONS ON BOTH WRISTS
FROM RESTRAINTS.

02:27.281 --> 02:29.317
KNEES ARE ALL SCRATCHED UP.

02:29.350 --> 02:32.220
LOOKS LIKE
SHE WAS HELD FACEDOWN

02:32.253 --> 02:36.657
AND CHOKED TO DEATH
WITH SOME KIND OF A...

02:36.690 --> 02:37.558
CHAIN.

02:38.926 --> 02:42.663
UH, SORRY, BUZZ,
COULD YOU PLEASE, UH...

02:42.696 --> 02:44.698
YEAH, OKAY.
THANK YOU.

02:44.732 --> 02:46.800
LIEUTENANT FLYNN,
DETECTIVE GABRIEL.

02:46.834 --> 02:50.671
LET'S TRACE KAREN'S WHEREABOUTS
OVER THE LAST 48 HOURS.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.873
THANK YOU.

02:54.808 --> 02:56.244
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA,
WOULD YOU PLEASE

02:56.277 --> 02:58.712
GET THE CLOTHES
OF OUR OTHER VICTIMS

02:58.746 --> 03:01.615
AND RUN THROUGH MUPS,
CATCH US UP WITH ViCAP?

03:01.649 --> 03:04.285
EXCUSE ME, CHIEF.
UH, TWO THINGS.

03:04.318 --> 03:06.987
THE KILLER MIGHT HAVE MURDERED
THIS GIRL LAST NIGHT,

03:07.020 --> 03:09.957
BUT HE DUG THE GRAVE
AT LEAST TWO DAYS AGO,

03:09.990 --> 03:11.259
'CAUSE THERE'S STILL WATER
ON THE BOTTOM

03:11.292 --> 03:12.760
FROM SATURDAY'S STORM.

03:12.793 --> 03:13.761
SO HE PREPPED IN ADVANCE,
IS HIGHLY ORGANIZED.

03:13.794 --> 03:16.664
WHAT'S THE OTHER THING?

03:16.697 --> 03:18.566
WE GOT TRACKS, CHIEF,
STARTING RIGHT HERE.

03:18.599 --> 03:22.970
IT SEEMS THAT OUR PSYCHO HEARD
OR SAW SOMETHING OVER THAT WAY

03:23.003 --> 03:25.806
AND RAN TOWARDS IT.

03:30.344 --> 03:31.579
SHIRT, TOO.

03:31.612 --> 03:32.780
YOU REMEMBER
FROM LAST TIME,

03:32.813 --> 03:33.947
THAT'S ANOTHER $20,
RIGHT?

03:33.981 --> 03:37.618
FINE.
JUST TAKE IT OFF.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.256
WAIT, WAIT, HOLD UP.

03:42.290 --> 03:44.958
WHAT?
WHAT'S THAT SOUND?

03:52.633 --> 03:54.268
HOLY CRAP.
IS HE BURYING SOMEBODY?

03:54.302 --> 03:55.869
WAIT -- OH!

03:55.903 --> 03:58.372
DAMN IT.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.847
No, no, no.
No!

04:19.893 --> 04:22.363
THE KILLER WASN'T THE ONLY ONE
LOOKING FOR PRIVACY LAST NIGHT.

04:22.396 --> 04:28.302
OKAY, CHIEF, ONE GUY, WEARING
DRESS SHOES GOES THAT WAY,

04:28.336 --> 04:29.670
BACK TOWARDS THE ROAD.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.038
AND THE OTHER GUY,
WEARING SNEAKERS,

04:31.071 --> 04:32.873
GETS CHASED
BY OUR KILLER --

04:32.906 --> 04:35.776
WATCH YOUR STEP --
OFF THIS WAY.

05:07.708 --> 05:08.976
OH, DAMN IT!

05:14.014 --> 05:15.949
SON OF A BITCH!

05:19.753 --> 05:20.988
UGH!

05:29.863 --> 05:31.832
Tao: LOOKS LIKE
THERE WAS A STRUGGLE,

05:31.865 --> 05:33.834
AND THE GUY IN THE SNEAKERS
WENT OVER THE SIDE HERE.

05:33.867 --> 05:39.072
HE GOT REALLY CLOSE TO OUR
KILLER, CHIEF -- REALLY CLOSE.

05:39.106 --> 05:41.775
OKAY, I WANT EVERY SQUARE INCH
OF THIS CANYON SEARCHED,

05:41.809 --> 05:45.112
AND LET'S MAKE SURE
THE GUY IN SNEAKERS CALLED 911

05:45.145 --> 05:47.014
AFTER HE FELL, NOT BEFORE.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.536
WOMAN: 911.
What's your emergency?

06:08.569 --> 06:10.771
UH, UH, SOMEONE
JUST TRIED TO KILL ME.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.005
THAT'S THE EMERGENCY.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.041
I GOT AWAY,
BUT HE HIT ME WITH A SHOVEL

06:14.074 --> 06:15.876
AND HE THREW ME
OVER A CLIFF.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.978
Sir, do you need
medical attention?

06:18.011 --> 06:20.080
NO, BUT, LIKE, THE GUY --
HE'S STILL UP THERE RIGHT NOW,

06:20.113 --> 06:23.517
AND, UH...
HE WAS BURYING --

06:23.551 --> 06:24.985
HE WAS BURYING A BODY --
A WOMAN.

06:25.018 --> 06:28.088
I-I THINK SHE WAS DEAD.

06:28.121 --> 06:30.090
HEY! HEY,
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT, HUH?

06:30.123 --> 06:31.425
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT?!

06:31.459 --> 06:32.893
Sir, are you
under the influence?

06:32.926 --> 06:34.928
NO, I'M NOT UNDER THE INFLUENCE!
ARE YOU?

06:34.962 --> 06:36.430
OR DO YOU JUST NOT CARE

06:36.464 --> 06:38.065
THAT YOU HAVE SOME KILLER
ON THE LOOSE RIGHT NOW?!

06:38.098 --> 06:39.767
All right, sir,
the GPS on your phone says

06:39.800 --> 06:41.502
you're actually
right across the street

06:41.535 --> 06:43.804
from the Greek Theatre
right now.

06:43.837 --> 06:46.206
If you'll just
go stand by the box office,

06:46.239 --> 06:48.408
we'll send some
police officers to you.

06:51.579 --> 06:53.180
Could you give me
your name and age, sir?

06:53.213 --> 06:54.915
Sir

06:54.948 --> 06:58.085
Sir
Hello?

06:58.118 --> 06:59.920
Hello, sir,
are you there?

06:59.953 --> 07:02.155
Sir, could you give me
your name and age?

07:02.189 --> 07:05.526
THANK YOU, BUZZ.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.495
THAT YOUNG MAN'S VOICE
SOUND AT ALL FAMILIAR TO YOU?

07:07.528 --> 07:10.498
NO. UH, I CAN'T PLACE IT.
SORRY.

07:10.531 --> 07:13.000
WE THINK HE MIGHT BE THE BOY
WHO STOLE YOUR PHONE LAST NIGHT.

07:13.033 --> 07:15.569
BOY? UH...

07:15.603 --> 07:18.539
WELL, UH, SOUNDS LIKE
HE GOT IN A LOT OF TROUBLE.

07:18.572 --> 07:19.940
I HOPE HE'S OKAY.

07:19.973 --> 07:22.543
SO, YOU SAY
SOMEONE TOOK YOUR PHONE

07:22.576 --> 07:24.044
WHILE YOU WERE AT A RESTAURANT
ON SUNSET?

07:24.077 --> 07:26.514
THAT'S THE LAST TIME
I REMEMBER HAVING IT, YES.

07:26.547 --> 07:30.584
AND DID ANYTHING ELSE GO MISSING
AT THE SAME TIME?

07:30.618 --> 07:34.822
OH, UM...NO.
NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF.

07:34.855 --> 07:36.123
HMM,
WHAT ABOUT THIS COAT...

07:36.156 --> 07:39.927
OR THESE GLASSES...
OR THE PEN?

07:39.960 --> 07:42.229
UH, THOSE AREN'T MINE.

07:42.262 --> 07:44.865
Provenza: SO WE WON'T FIND
YOUR FINGERPRINTS

07:44.898 --> 07:46.099
ON ANY OF THIS STUFF?

07:47.935 --> 07:50.103
MAYBE I SHOULD ASK YOUR WIFE
IF SHE RECOGNIZES THIS COAT,

07:50.137 --> 07:52.105
OR ONE OF YOUR KIDS.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.508
HOW WOULD YOU
LIKE TO EXPLAIN TO THEM

07:54.542 --> 07:56.577
WHY YOU WERE
IN GRIFFITH PARK AT NIGHT

07:56.610 --> 07:58.912
WITH A --
A SHIRTLESS MINOR?

07:58.946 --> 08:01.649
NO, NO.
NO, NO, HE'S NOT A MINOR.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.917
DON'T SAY HE'S A MINOR.
HE'S 18.

08:03.951 --> 08:04.952
OH, MY GOD.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.019
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

08:06.053 --> 08:07.855
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

08:07.888 --> 08:10.591
OKAY, SO,
YOU'RE CERTAIN OF HIS AGE,

08:10.624 --> 08:12.025
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
HIS NAME?

08:12.059 --> 08:14.928
MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.

08:14.962 --> 08:18.131
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY,
MR. GRAND, YOU CAN EITHER

08:18.165 --> 08:20.133
BEGIN THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
AS A SEX OFFENDER

08:20.167 --> 08:23.036
OR YOU CAN START COOPERATING
WITH ME RIGHT NOW.

08:23.070 --> 08:26.574
UH, I'LL COOPERATE.
LET ME COOPERATE, PLEASE.

08:26.607 --> 08:29.577
WHAT SCARED YOU SO MUCH
LAST NIGHT

08:29.610 --> 08:31.545
THAT YOU RAN OFF WITHOUT
YOUR COAT AND YOUR PHONE?

08:33.046 --> 08:36.617
A GUY...IN BLACK,
WITH A MASK.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.251
UM, HE WAS
PRETTY FAR OFF.

08:38.285 --> 08:42.089
I -- I DIDN'T HAVE MY GLASSES
ON, AND -- AND HE WAS...

08:42.122 --> 08:45.092
IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS BURYING
SOMEONE, AND I RAN.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.994
I -- THAT'S ALL. I RAN.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.228
AND LEFT
A TEENAGER BEHIND?

08:48.261 --> 08:50.197
WELL, I THOUGHT
HE WAS FOLLOWING ME.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.566
I -- I PANICKED.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.603
UH, IS HE OKAY?

08:55.636 --> 08:58.972
WHAT'S THE BOY'S NAME?
HE SAYS "RUSTY."

08:59.006 --> 09:01.041
SAYS RUSTY? SO,
YOU'VE SEEN HIM MULTIPLE TIMES?

09:01.074 --> 09:03.010
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT IS RUSTY'S LAST NAME?

09:03.043 --> 09:05.045
I DON'T KNOW.
HOW DO YOU
GET IN TOUCH WITH HIM?

09:05.078 --> 09:07.047
I DON'T GET IN TOUCH.

09:07.080 --> 09:10.050
HE HANGS OUT
ON SUNSET BOULEVARD.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.919
OKAY, UH,
LIEUTENANT, DETECTIVE,

09:11.952 --> 09:14.955
WOULD YOU PLEASE TAKE MR. GRAND
HERE IN HIS OWN CAR,

09:14.988 --> 09:17.925
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND RUSTY
IN HIS USUAL PLACE?

09:17.958 --> 09:22.362
NOW, LOOK, I'M -- I'M NOT
THE ONLY PERSON RUSTY SEES.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.633
PLEASE, I'M DEPRESSED ENOUGH.
GET UP. LET'S GO.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.034
LET'S GO!

09:28.636 --> 09:31.371
SO, CHIEF, SATURDAY,
OUR VICTIM, KAREN,

09:31.404 --> 09:34.307
BOUGHT SOME PERFUME AT A
DEPARTMENT STORE AT THE GROVE.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.176
SO, WHEN I ASKED THE STORE
FOR THEIR SECURITY FOOTAGE

09:36.209 --> 09:38.946
BASED AROUND THE TIME
OF HER CREDIT-CARD RECEIPT,

09:38.979 --> 09:39.980
THIS IS WHAT THEY SENT.

09:42.650 --> 09:46.186
OKAY, BUZZ. HIT IT.

09:48.155 --> 09:50.357
ALL RIGHT,
THERE'S OUR VICTIM AND SOME GUY

09:50.390 --> 09:52.359
WALKING UP
TO A FRAGRANCE COUNTER.

09:52.392 --> 09:54.327
YOU NOTICE HOW HE KEEPS HIS BACK
TO THE CAMERA?

09:54.361 --> 09:56.096
NOW, HE HANDS KAREN
A BUSINESS CARD

09:56.129 --> 09:57.397
WHILE SHE'S
MAKING THE PURCHASE.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.700
IT'S AS IF THEY JUST MET
OR SOMETHING.

09:59.733 --> 10:03.170
CLERK GIVES HER THE BAG, SHE
SAYS GOODBYE, AND THEN LEAVES.

10:03.203 --> 10:06.173
NOW, THE GUY -- HE LEAVES
IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION,

10:06.206 --> 10:09.743
NEVER SHOWING HIS FACE
TO THE CAMERA EVEN ONCE.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.983
BUZZ, COULD YOU ISOLATE
AND ENLARGE THAT FOOTAGE

10:16.016 --> 10:18.385
OF THE GUY LEAVING THE STORE
AND PLAY IT AGAIN?

10:18.418 --> 10:20.120
LET ME SEE HERE.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.323
HOLD ON.

10:23.356 --> 10:24.758
ZOOMING.

10:32.332 --> 10:35.402
LIEUTENANT, I WANT ALL THE
SECURITY FOOTAGE FROM THE GROVE

10:35.435 --> 10:37.805
THREE HOURS ON EITHER
SIDE OF THE TIME STAMP
ON THAT RECEIPT --

10:37.838 --> 10:40.173
VALET STANDS, OTHER STORES,
EVERYTHING.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.441
ALREADY IN PROCESS,
CHIEF.

10:41.474 --> 10:45.212
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING THERE,
CHIEF?

10:45.245 --> 10:48.115
NOT WHAT, COMMANDER.
WHO.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.383
THE MAN LEAVING THAT STORE
IS PHILLIP STROH.

11:02.763 --> 11:03.563
Pope: DOES THIS LOOK LIKE
STROH TO YOU?

11:05.298 --> 11:06.767
BECAUSE TO ME,
IT COULD BE A LOT OF PEOPLE.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.137
HOW ARE YOU SO CERTAIN?

11:10.170 --> 11:11.839
I RECOGNIZED HIS WALK.

11:11.872 --> 11:14.274
HIS WALK
FROM BEHIND?

11:14.307 --> 11:16.443
ESPECIALLY FROM BEHIND.
I'VE FOLLOWED HIM SEVERAL TIMES.

11:16.476 --> 11:18.812
THAT MIGHT NOT BE
THE BEST WAY

11:18.846 --> 11:21.048
TO GET A SEARCH WARRANT
FROM A JUDGE.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.182
IS THERE ANYTHING
MORE SUBSTANTIAL

11:22.215 --> 11:23.784
CONNECTING KAREN ONCIDI
TO STROH?

11:23.817 --> 11:26.319
OTHER THAN HIM MEETING HER
AT THE DEPARTMENT STORE

11:26.353 --> 11:28.221
TWO DAYS AGO, NOT YET,
BUT WE'RE WORKING ON IT.

11:28.255 --> 11:29.823
THE AMOUNT OF DECOMP
IN OUR OTHER VICTIMS

11:29.857 --> 11:31.391
SUGGESTS THE BURIALS STARTED
OVER TWO YEARS AGO.

11:31.424 --> 11:34.094
Taylor:
OH, RIGHT -- CHIEF JOHNSON,

11:34.127 --> 11:36.196
DIDN'T YOU HAVE A GPS TRACKER
ON STROH'S VEHICLE?

11:36.229 --> 11:37.464
I'VE ALREADY CHECKED.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.466
HE NEVER WENT ANYWHERE
NEAR THE CRIME SCENE

11:39.499 --> 11:41.334
IN HIS OWN VEHICLE,
BUT HE COULD HAVE RENTED ONE.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.270
OR MAYBE HE HAD AN AUTOMOBILE
IN A RENTED GARAGE SOMEWHERE.

11:43.303 --> 11:45.806
THAT IS WHY
I AM ASKING PERMISSION

11:45.839 --> 11:48.508
TO SEARCH HIS FINANCES,
DUMP HIS PHONES.

11:48.541 --> 11:52.145
PLEASE, I HAVE STAYED AWAY
FROM HIM AS ORDERED.

11:52.179 --> 11:53.480
YEAH, FOR WHAT?
A WHOLE SEVEN WEEKS?

11:53.513 --> 11:54.848
THAT'S WHY
THIS ORDER WAS GIVEN.

11:54.882 --> 11:57.084
YOU KEEP SEEING STROH
EVERYWHERE.

11:57.117 --> 11:59.787
THIS MAN IS STROH.
IT IS.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.388
THEN CONNECT HIM
TO THESE MURDERS

12:01.421 --> 12:02.890
WITH THE KIND OF EVIDENCE
THAT HOBBS SAYS

12:02.923 --> 12:04.357
CAN GET US
A SEARCH WARRANT.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.326
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.
I'M JUST HERE TO OBSERVE.

12:06.359 --> 12:08.261
I'M NOT GETTING IN THE
WAY OF CHIEF JOHNSON'S
INVESTIGATION.

12:11.331 --> 12:14.467
UNTIL YOU ARE SWORN IN
AS CHIEF OF POLICE,

12:14.501 --> 12:17.537
I SHOULD STICK TO
DEALING WITH THE MORALE
ISSUES WE DISCUSSED.

12:17.570 --> 12:20.473
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD
REALLY HELP MORALE?

12:20.507 --> 12:22.342
BEING ABLE TO AGGRESSIVELY
PURSUE THE KILLER.

12:22.375 --> 12:24.111
Raydor:
HOW ABOUT THIS?

12:24.144 --> 12:26.213
WHILE STROH
IS A PERSON OF INTEREST,

12:26.246 --> 12:29.282
I WILL SIGN OFF
ON CHIEF JOHNSON'S INVESTIGATION

12:29.316 --> 12:31.518
TO COVER THE L.A.P.D.'s
LIABILITY ISSUES.

12:31.551 --> 12:34.454
I CAN LIVE WITH THAT.
CHIEF JOHNSON?

12:34.487 --> 12:36.323
I CAME HERE
TO ARRANGE SURVEILLANCE

12:36.356 --> 12:37.825
OF THE SUSPECT, NOT ME.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.893
THIS IS WHAT COMES
OF SETTLING LAWSUITS --

12:39.927 --> 12:42.162
PUTTING MY NAME
ON A SPECIAL ORDER.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.397
WE HAVE TO WORRY MORE ABOUT
WHAT THE SUSPECT WILL DO TO US

12:44.431 --> 12:46.433
THAN WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO
TO THE SUSPECT.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.268
DIDN'T THINK OF THAT,
DID YOU?

12:50.570 --> 12:51.771
THANK YOU.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.341
CAPTAIN, THANK YOU.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.479
Rusty:
YOU DON'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND
WHO THE VICTIM IS HERE.

12:59.512 --> 13:03.150
SOMEONE TRIED TO KILL ME LAST
NIGHT, AND I'M JUST A TEENAGER.

13:03.183 --> 13:06.319
WELL, DON'T WORRY. WE'LL
CHILDPROOF THE BUILDING FOR YOU.

13:06.353 --> 13:08.288
UH, HE'S NOT A CHILD.
HE'S 18.

13:08.321 --> 13:09.589
CAN I GO HOME NOW?

13:09.622 --> 13:11.859
LOOK, I HELPED YOU FIND HIM,
LIKE YOU ASKED.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.193
HEY, THAT'S ENTRAPMENT.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.428
AND HE OWES ME MONEY.
OH, REALLY?

13:15.462 --> 13:19.266
NOW, WHY DOES MR. GRAND
OWE YOU MONEY?

13:21.468 --> 13:24.437
MY TIME.
HMM.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.539
YOU'RE WAY TOO YOUNG
TO KNOW ALL THE RIGHT ANSWERS.

13:26.573 --> 13:29.542
OFFICERS, HOLD MR. GRAND
IN THE BREAK ROOM, PLEASE.

13:31.979 --> 13:33.380
THANK YOU.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.215
GABRIEL,
IF YOU DON'T MIND,

13:35.248 --> 13:37.417
WHY DON'T YOU HANG HERE
WITH THE KID.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.419
I'LL RUN HIS PRINTS.
AND...

13:39.452 --> 13:40.954
GET HIM SOMETHING TO EAT.

13:41.989 --> 13:43.590
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.959
I'D LIKE A HAMBURGER.

13:47.527 --> 13:50.197
Fritz: AND FROM THE CLOTHES
YOU DUG UP WITH HER,

13:50.230 --> 13:51.932
YOUR SERIAL KILLER'S
FOURTH VICTIM

13:51.965 --> 13:55.202
SEEMS TO BE
ANNA SILLS FROM SANTA MONICA.

13:55.235 --> 13:58.271
LIKE ALL THE OTHER YOUNG WOMEN,
ANNA WANTED TO BE AN ACTOR.

13:58.305 --> 14:01.441
AND HER ROOMMATE
TOLD THE SANTA MONICA POLICE

14:01.474 --> 14:03.944
THAT THE DAY
BEFORE ANNA VANISHED,

14:03.977 --> 14:05.645
SHE WAS APPROACHED
WHILE SHOPPING

14:05.678 --> 14:09.316
BY A PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER
WHO OFFERED HER FREE HEADSHOTS

14:09.349 --> 14:10.884
IF SHE POSED
FOR HIS PORTFOLIO.

14:10.918 --> 14:12.953
NO PHONE RECORDS
CONNECTING ANNA TO STROH,

14:12.986 --> 14:14.554
NOTHING ON HER LAPTOP,

14:14.587 --> 14:16.957
AND NOTHING FROM ANY OF STROH'S
KNOWN E-MAIL ADDRESSES.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.391
WE'RE 0 FOR 4.

14:18.425 --> 14:20.293
I've found the witness.

14:20.327 --> 14:21.995
WHAT ABOUT
VICTIM NUMBER 5?

14:22.029 --> 14:23.363
Fritz: CAN'T I.D. HER
FROM WHAT WAS IN THE GRAVE,

14:23.396 --> 14:25.498
BUT I'M WILLING TO BET
SHE WAS BLONDE

14:25.532 --> 14:28.235
AND WANTED TO BE AN ACTOR.
CHIEF, MORALES SAYS
THE RAPE KIT'S A WASH.

14:28.268 --> 14:31.371
NO DNA
FROM LAST NIGHT'S VICTIM.

14:31.404 --> 14:35.008
OKAY, BLONDE, UNDER 30, NO DNA.
THAT'S ALL STROH.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.510
I MEAN, HOW MUCH MORE OF THIS
HAS TO FIT HIS PROFILE

14:37.544 --> 14:39.046
BEFORE WE CAN CHECK
INTO HIS FINANCES?

14:39.079 --> 14:40.680
HE IS NOT A REGISTERED
SEX OFFENDER, LIEUTENANT,

14:40.713 --> 14:44.384
SO LEGALLY
HE DOESN'T HAVE A PROFILE.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.920
AND I SEE THAT MR. STROH
WORKED WITH A PARTNER,

14:46.954 --> 14:48.255
BUT THERE'S NO SIGN
OF THAT HERE.

14:48.288 --> 14:51.324
SO HIS M.O.
IS NOT EXACTLY THE SAME.

14:51.358 --> 14:55.595
BUT I AM NOT PREVENTING ANYONE
FROM ASKING FOR A WARRANT.

14:55.628 --> 14:58.031
LET A JUDGE DECIDE.

14:58.065 --> 15:01.434
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, WHY CAN'T WE
DO A CREDIT REPORT ON STROH?

15:01.468 --> 15:03.003
I MEAN, MAYBE THE GUY
DID SOME SHOPPING

15:03.036 --> 15:04.671
AT THE GROVE
THIS PAST SATURDAY.

15:04.704 --> 15:08.041
I KNOW THAT HE SUED US, BUT
NOBODY HERE IS GONNA TELL HIM.

15:08.075 --> 15:09.409
I MEAN,
GABRIEL'S NOT IN THE ROOM

15:09.442 --> 15:12.445
ANDY! THAT'S ENOUGH.
I'M SERIOUS.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.447
WELL, I'M SERIOUS, TOO,
'CAUSE IF I HAD DONE
WHAT GABRIEL HAD DONE,

15:14.481 --> 15:17.050
I WOULD AT LEAST
HAVE THE DECENCY TO LEAVE.

15:17.084 --> 15:19.486
OKAY, HEY, HEY, HEY!
HEY, HEY!
WHAT? I WOULD!

15:19.519 --> 15:21.721
YOU AND SANCHEZ,
KNOCK IT OFF.
HEY, I DIDN'T EVEN
SAY ANYTHING, SIR.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.457
WELL, YOU JUST
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.
THE CHIEF SAID
THAT'S ENOUGH.

15:27.995 --> 15:31.098
FLYNN, YOU WANT TO LOOK INTO
STROH'S FINANCES --

15:31.131 --> 15:34.301
THE CAPTAIN JUST SAID IT --
GET A WARRANT.

15:34.334 --> 15:35.668
GABRIEL ISN'T
THE SUSPECT TODAY.

15:37.670 --> 15:40.407
WHAT'S NEXT, CHIEF?

15:42.742 --> 15:46.046
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA
FOUND OUR POTENTIAL WITNESS.

15:46.079 --> 15:48.448
THE BOY CALLED 911,
SO I'LL TALK TO HIM

15:48.481 --> 15:50.583
WHILE WE CONTINUE
TO LOOK FOR CONNECTIONS

15:50.617 --> 15:54.421
BETWEEN THESE WOMEN AND...

15:54.454 --> 15:55.722
STROH.

15:55.755 --> 16:00.393
AND LET'S HELP THE FBI IDENTIFY
OUR LAST VICTIM.

16:01.694 --> 16:05.432
UH, CAPTAIN, YOU MIGHT
WANT TO WATCH THIS INTERVIEW.

16:06.499 --> 16:07.700
EXCUSE ME.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.441
Rusty:
IT'S COMPLETELY UNFAIR.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.076
I MEAN, I CALL YOU GUYS

16:16.109 --> 16:18.111
ABOUT A KILLER
ATTACKING ME WITH A SHOVEL.

16:18.145 --> 16:20.547
AND INSTEAD OF GOING AFTER HIM,
YOU GO AFTER ME.

16:20.580 --> 16:23.350
HELLO, THERE, RUSTY.
I'M DEPUTY CHIEF JOHNSON.

16:23.383 --> 16:26.486
THE L.A.P.D. JUST WANTS TO
PROTECT YOU FROM A VERY BAD MAN.

16:26.519 --> 16:30.557
BAD MEN
ARE HOW I MAKE A LIVING.

16:30.590 --> 16:34.361
I HANG OUT
WHERE ALL THE BAD MEN GO.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.629
BAD MEN
LIKE TO TALK TO ME.

16:36.663 --> 16:40.133
AND IT DOESN'T HURT ANYBODY
TO LISTEN.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.504
NOT SO SURE ABOUT THAT.

16:44.537 --> 16:48.508
WELL, I'M NOT AFRAID OF THEM.
I KNOW HOW TO PROTECT MYSELF.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.610
I SEE YOU'VE MET
WITH THE POLICE BEFORE.

16:50.643 --> 16:53.380
THEY SENT YOU OVER TO DCS,
PUT YOU IN FOSTER CARE.

16:53.413 --> 16:54.481
WHY'D YOU RUN AWAY?

16:56.149 --> 16:58.385
HATE GETTING HIT
IN THE FACE.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.753
IT SAYS "DEPARTMENT
OF CHILDREN'S SERVICES" HERE.

17:00.787 --> 17:03.056
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WERE 18.

17:04.424 --> 17:06.393
WELL -- NOW.

17:06.426 --> 17:09.396
NOW I'M 18.
BACK THEN, I WAS 17.

17:09.429 --> 17:12.132
SAYS HERE THAT YOU'RE 16
AND THAT YOUR LAST NAME IS BECK.

17:12.165 --> 17:14.567
IS THAT RIGHT?
I DON'T NEED
A LAST NAME.

17:14.601 --> 17:16.603
AND YOUR PARENTS
ARE WHERE?

17:16.636 --> 17:18.438
I'M 18, SO WHERE MY PARENTS
ARE DOESN'T MATTER.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.773
YOU'RE NOT 18, SO WE NEED
TO KNOW WHERE YOUR MOM AND --

17:20.807 --> 17:23.543
OKAY, I DON'T HAVE A FATHER,
AND MY MOTHER LEFT, OKAY?!

17:23.576 --> 17:25.578
SHE'S GONE!
GONE WHERE?

17:27.147 --> 17:29.116
GOD, ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:29.149 --> 17:30.850
I'LL JUST GO OVER
THE WHOLE STUPID STORY AGAIN.

17:30.883 --> 17:34.421
SO, SHE AND HER JERK BOYFRIEND
DROPPED ME OFF AT THE ZOO

17:34.454 --> 17:37.090
AND SAID THAT THEY WOULD
PICK ME UP IN A COUPLE OF HOURS,

17:37.124 --> 17:38.458
AND THEY NEVER CAME BACK.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.693
SO I WALKED
ALL THE WAY TO THE APARTMENT

17:40.727 --> 17:42.729
WHERE WE WERE STAYING AT,
AND THEY WERE GONE.

17:42.762 --> 17:45.132
AND YOU GUYS AREN'T EVEN
LOOKING FOR HER RIGHT NOW,

17:45.165 --> 17:49.136
SO MY MOTHER IS GONE,
OKAY?

17:49.169 --> 17:51.571
SHE'S GONE.

17:54.141 --> 18:00.680
IT'S JUST EASIER IF WE ALL
JUST PRETEND I'M 18, ALL RIGHT?

18:02.749 --> 18:03.750
PLEASE?

18:05.718 --> 18:08.855
IF I'M 18,
I'LL HELP YOU GUYS OUT. DEAL?

18:08.888 --> 18:11.090
OKAY.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.694
LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

18:14.727 --> 18:17.730
WHY WERE YOU IN THAT PARTICULAR
PART OF GRIFFITH PARK?

18:17.764 --> 18:20.733
I LIKE THE VIEW
FROM UP THERE.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.703
THERE WAS NO VIEW
FROM WHERE YOU WERE.

18:23.736 --> 18:25.605
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE
ABOUT IT.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.240
HEY, BUT IT'S A GOOD THING
FOR YOU GUYS

18:27.274 --> 18:28.675
THAT I WAS THERE,
THOUGH, HUH?

18:28.708 --> 18:32.479
I MADE THE CALL
THAT HELPED YOU FIND BODIES.

18:32.512 --> 18:34.547
THE GUY YOU CALLED ABOUT --
HE ATTACKED YOU?

18:34.581 --> 18:37.750
MM-HMM.
CAN YOU DESCRIBE HIM
A LITTLE?

18:37.784 --> 18:41.788
HE WAS WEARING ALL BLACK.
HE HAD A MASK ON.

18:41.821 --> 18:44.291
HE WAS TALLER THAN ME.
LET'S SEE, WHAT ELSE?

18:44.324 --> 18:46.759
OH, YEAH, HE HIT ME IN THE HEAD
WITH A SHOVEL,

18:46.793 --> 18:49.629
AND I ROLLED OFF A CLIFF --
THE END.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.898
SO THEN YOU FOUGHT
WITH THIS GUY?
YEAH, A LITTLE.

18:51.931 --> 18:53.766
LOOK, MY JOB --
I HAVE TO KNOW

18:53.800 --> 18:55.635
HOW TO ROLL GUYS
WHO ARE BIGGER THAN ME.

18:55.668 --> 18:59.606
LIKE, SOMETIMES I -- I LET
MY BODY GO COMPLETELY SLACK,

18:59.639 --> 19:00.940
AND THEN
THEY HAVE TO HOLD ME HARDER,

19:00.973 --> 19:02.642
AND THEN YOU JUST
FLIP THEM.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.511
IT'S REAL EASY.

19:04.544 --> 19:08.215
THIS GUY
CAME BACK SWINGING HARD.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.583
AND HIT YOU IN THE HEAD?

19:10.617 --> 19:12.719
WHERE?

19:15.955 --> 19:19.226
OH, WE SHOULD HAVE A DOCTOR
LOOK AT THAT.
NO, NO, NO,
IT'S NOT AS BAD AS IT LOOKS.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.761
NO WARRANT ON STROH
OFF WHAT THIS KID HAS TO SAY.

19:21.794 --> 19:24.697
LOOK, YOU KNOW
I'VE TOLD YOU GUYS
EVERYTHING I KNOW,

19:24.731 --> 19:26.666
SO HOW ABOUT YOU JUST
GIVE ME MY BURGER

19:26.699 --> 19:27.667
AND THEN I'LL LEAVE,
OKAY?

19:27.700 --> 19:29.269
WELL, I DON'T THINK

19:29.302 --> 19:31.838
THAT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA,
RUSTY,

19:31.871 --> 19:33.306
BECAUSE YOU MAY NOT HAVE SEEN
THE KILLER'S FACE,

19:33.340 --> 19:35.908
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
HE SAW YOURS.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.645
AND YOU SAW HOW QUICKLY
WE FOUND YOU.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.681
GUY COULD DO THE SAME THING.
HE ATTACKED YOU FOR A REASON.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.817
BECAUSE YOU DID SEE HIM
WITHOUT HIS MASK, DIDN'T YOU?

19:44.851 --> 19:46.686
NO.

19:46.719 --> 19:48.655
YOU PULLED THIS MASK
OFF HIS HEAD...
I BOUGHT THAT.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.723
...DURING THE FIGHT,
AND YOU SAW HIS FACE.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.559
OKAY, I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING,
ALL RIGHT?!

19:52.592 --> 19:54.294
SO STOP SAYING THAT.

19:54.327 --> 19:56.963
AND YOU GUYS ARE NOT
MAKING SOME KIND OF
WITNESS OUT OF ME.

19:56.996 --> 19:58.565
NO WAY.

19:58.598 --> 19:59.966
BUZZ, WOULD YOU HAVE
LIEUTENANT TAO

19:59.999 --> 20:03.303
COME IN HERE, PLEASE,
WITH HIS CAMERA?

20:03.336 --> 20:06.973
RUSTY, I WANT YOU
TO TAKE THIS PHONE,

20:07.006 --> 20:10.009
GET UP,
STAND OVER THERE, PLEASE.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.578
GO ON,
OVER THERE BY THE WALL.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.713
GO ON.
TURN AROUND.

20:14.847 --> 20:17.284
TAKE OFF YOUR SHIRT.
WHAT

20:17.317 --> 20:18.851
YOU WEREN'T WEARING YOUR SHIRT
LAST NIGHT,

20:18.885 --> 20:20.219
SO TAKE IT OFF, PLEASE.

20:22.755 --> 20:23.723
THANK YOU.

20:23.756 --> 20:25.358
HERE YOU GO.
PUT THIS ON.

20:26.793 --> 20:29.729
NOW PUT THE PHONE
UP TO YOUR EAR.

20:29.762 --> 20:33.733
ALL RIGHT, YOU -- YOU WANT
TO KNOW WHERE I GOT THE MASK?

20:34.901 --> 20:36.235
THEN YOU FIND MY MOTHER.

20:37.437 --> 20:39.238
THAT'S A FAIR TRADE.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.909
CHIEF...
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

20:42.942 --> 20:45.912
THE KILLER THOUGHT HE HAD
A REASON TO ATTACK RUSTY BEFORE.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.714
I WANT TO PROVE HIM RIGHT.

20:47.747 --> 20:52.652
LIEUTENANT TAO, CAN YOU PLEASE
TAKE A PICTURE OF RUSTY HERE,

20:52.685 --> 20:54.887
AND MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
IT'S NIGHTTIME

20:54.921 --> 20:57.023
AND HE'S ON THE STREET,
LIKE IT'S A STILL

20:57.056 --> 20:59.326
FROM THE GREEK THEATRE
SECURITY CAMERAS?

20:59.359 --> 21:00.360
YEAH, I CAN DO THAT.

21:00.393 --> 21:01.828
THANK YOU.

21:01.861 --> 21:04.664
NOW, UH, IF YOU DON'T MIND.
THANK YOU.

21:06.399 --> 21:07.967
LOOK NATURAL.

21:10.870 --> 21:12.038
YEAH.

21:12.071 --> 21:15.041
YEAH,
I HATE THE COPS, TOO.

21:15.074 --> 21:18.044
YEAH, THE SERVICE IS TERRIBLE,
DUDE, AND THE FOOD NEVER COMES.

21:18.077 --> 21:19.812
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE,
CHIEF?

21:19.846 --> 21:23.015
I KEEP BEING TOLD THAT THE PRESS
IS ALL OVER THIS CASE,

21:23.049 --> 21:25.918
SO I'M GONNA GIVE THEM
A PICTURE OF RUSTY BECK

21:25.952 --> 21:27.820
AND SEE IF THEY CAN HELP US FIND
A VERY IMPORTANT WITNESS.

21:27.854 --> 21:29.756
AND WHAT'S
THE NAME OF THIS WITNESS?

21:31.090 --> 21:32.892
RUSTY BECK.

21:41.401 --> 21:42.402
Man: EVERY SHERIFF'S DEPUTY
AND POLICE OFFICER

21:44.103 --> 21:45.805
IN THE SOUTHLAND...

21:45.838 --> 21:47.674
...IS CURRENTLY LOOKING
FOR THIS YOUNG MAN,

21:47.707 --> 21:48.408
WHO AUTHORITIES FEAR
COULD BE IN SERIOUS DANGER.

21:48.441 --> 21:50.410
HEY.
HEY.

21:50.443 --> 21:52.412
THESE STILLS WERE TAKEN
FROM SECURITY CAMERAS

21:52.445 --> 21:54.347
ACROSS FROM THE GREEK THEATRE
AFTER A SCARY, FACE-TO-FACE

21:54.381 --> 21:56.383
NIGHTTIME ENCOUNTER
WITH A SERIAL KILLER.

21:56.416 --> 21:59.686
YOU REALLY THINK STROH
MIGHT GO LOOKING FOR THIS KID?
I SURE HOPE SO...

21:59.719 --> 22:01.721
HERE'S TEENAGE RUNAWAY
RUSTY BECK TALKING TO 911.

22:01.754 --> 22:02.989
...'CAUSE I'LL LOSE MY JOB
IF I GO AFTER HIM.

22:03.022 --> 22:05.124
WOMAN: 911.
What's your emergency?

22:05.157 --> 22:07.694
Rusty: UH, UH, SOMEONE
JUST TRIED TO KILL ME.
THAT'S THE EMERGENCY.

22:07.727 --> 22:09.796
RUSTY LINKS HIM
TO EVERYTHING.
I GOT AWAY,
BUT HE HIT ME IN THE...

22:10.863 --> 22:13.700
HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO I.D.
OUR FIFTH VICTIM?

22:13.733 --> 22:15.101
NO.

22:15.134 --> 22:18.438
LOOK, I'M GONNA TAKE A QUICK
TRIP TO WASHINGTON TOMORROW,

22:18.471 --> 22:22.141
ONE NIGHT, SEE IF I CAN'T,
UH, EXPEDITE THIS.

22:22.174 --> 22:26.713
BUT, UH,
THE ONLY THING IS...

22:26.746 --> 22:28.948
ARE YOU SURE
THE KILLER IS STROH?

22:28.981 --> 22:30.717
I'M POSITIVE.

22:30.750 --> 22:33.453
I JUST DON'T KNOW IF I'LL
BE ALLOWED TO ARREST HIM.

22:39.492 --> 22:42.729
AND THIS BOY...

22:42.762 --> 22:44.831
THERE'S SOMETHING HE SAID.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.132
WHAT?

22:46.165 --> 22:48.935
YOU'RE GONNA BE SURPRISED.

22:48.968 --> 22:50.803
WHAT?

22:50.837 --> 22:53.573
MADE ME THINK
ABOUT MY LIFE.

22:54.807 --> 22:56.409
I'M SURPRISED.

22:56.443 --> 22:57.810
TOLD YOU.

23:04.784 --> 23:06.486
WHAT DID RUSTY SAY?

23:06.519 --> 23:07.987
UM...

23:10.523 --> 23:13.125
HE SAID THAT, UH...

23:19.999 --> 23:23.503
...BAD MEN
WERE HOW HE MADE A LIVING...

23:23.536 --> 23:26.773
AND THAT IT DOESN'T HURT
TO JUST LISTEN TO THEM...

23:26.806 --> 23:33.079
AND THAT, UM, HIS MOTHER WAS
GONE AND SHE WASN'T COMING BACK.

23:33.112 --> 23:37.517
AND, UM, I STARTED TO THINK
ABOUT HOW SAD THAT STORY WAS,

23:37.550 --> 23:41.087
AND THEN I REALIZED...
THAT'S ME.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.789
HMM.

23:42.822 --> 23:45.057
YOU MAKE YOUR LIVING
LISTENING TO BAD PEOPLE...

23:47.159 --> 23:48.861
...AND YOUR MOTHER'S GONE.

23:48.895 --> 23:52.465
AND SHE'S NEVER COMING BACK.

23:55.101 --> 23:57.169
STROH IS.

23:57.203 --> 24:01.073
THAT'S WHAT I HAVE
TO LOOK FORWARD TO --

24:01.107 --> 24:03.075
STROH COMING BACK.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.645
WHERE?

24:08.247 --> 24:10.517
WHERE THE BAD MEN GO.

24:30.269 --> 24:34.040
FELLAS.
OH, MAN.

24:34.073 --> 24:36.609
THOUGHT IF YOU BOYS
WERE GONNA BE OUT HERE

24:36.643 --> 24:37.977
ALL NIGHT AND DAY,

24:38.010 --> 24:40.580
I MIGHT AS WELL
GET A LOOK AND SEE

24:40.613 --> 24:43.149
HOW THIS LICENSE-RECOGNITION
SYSTEM WORKS.

24:44.684 --> 24:46.653
UP TO 1,000 PLATES A MINUTE.
IT'S GORGEOUS.

24:46.686 --> 24:47.987
HOW'S OUR SO-CALLED
MISSING WITNESS HOLDING UP?

24:48.020 --> 24:49.922
NOT RUNNING OFF?
Gabriel: NO, NO.

24:49.956 --> 24:52.124
CHIEF JOHNSON
PROMISED HIM SOME NEW CLOTHES

24:52.158 --> 24:54.561
AND THAT WE'D TRY TO FIND
HIS MOTHER IF HE HELPED US OUT.

24:54.594 --> 24:59.131
PLUS, WE GOT SANCHEZ, FLYNN,
AND PROVENZA ON THE STREET.

24:59.165 --> 25:00.299
YEAH, I HEARD THAT.

25:00.332 --> 25:02.935
MYSELF, I'D HAVE KEPT
PROVENZA IN HERE

25:02.969 --> 25:04.136
AND PUT YOU
OUT ON THE STREET.

25:04.170 --> 25:06.205
YOU'RE YOUNGER, YOU RUN.

25:06.238 --> 25:08.140
MAKES IT LOOK LIKE SOMETHING
OTHER THAN THE JOB

25:08.174 --> 25:11.944
IS DRIVING THE ASSIGNMENTS
IN YOUR DIVISION.

25:11.978 --> 25:14.547
I SURE HOPE IT'S NOT
A SAFETY ISSUE.

25:14.581 --> 25:16.616
I HEAR YOU.

25:18.217 --> 25:19.652
OH, LIEUTENANT, THAT'S
SEVEN HITS ON THE SAME CAR.

25:19.686 --> 25:22.221
RECOGNITION SYSTEM
SAYS IT'S A RENTAL...

25:22.254 --> 25:24.891
AND IT'S PARKING.

25:24.924 --> 25:26.659
ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
BE READY, BE READY.

25:32.164 --> 25:35.635
PHILLIP STROH.

25:35.668 --> 25:36.703
OOH.

25:49.081 --> 25:50.917
HELLO, RUSTY.

25:50.950 --> 25:53.953
HEY. IT'S GREAT
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

25:54.987 --> 25:56.656
YOU KNOW MY NAME.
WHAT'S YOURS?

25:56.689 --> 25:57.957
Provenza:
PHILLIP STROH.

25:58.691 --> 26:01.127
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.595
NICE HAT.

26:02.629 --> 26:04.096
THANKS.
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

26:04.130 --> 26:05.331
HOW YOU LIKE THAT,
ASSHOLE?!

26:05.364 --> 26:06.999
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT!

26:07.033 --> 26:08.234
IT'S OKAY.
WE'LL DO THAT.

26:08.267 --> 26:10.102
SANCHEZ.
WANT TO WAIVE, COUNSELOR?

26:10.136 --> 26:12.371
THAT DEPENDS.
WHY AM I UNDER ARREST?

26:12.404 --> 26:16.075
YOU MAY THINK THAT ILLEGAL
CRUISING ON SUNSET BOULEVARD

26:16.108 --> 26:17.343
IS A FRIVOLOUS CHARGE,

26:17.376 --> 26:18.945
BUT IT'S WHO
YOU WERE LOOKING FOR

26:18.978 --> 26:21.013
THAT GIVES THE GAME AWAY.

26:21.047 --> 26:24.050
HE WAS THE BOY
YOU ATTACKED

26:24.083 --> 26:27.219
THE NIGHT YOU WERE BURYING
THIS WOMAN.

26:27.253 --> 26:30.356
I THOUGHT SHE WASN'T GONNA
PICK UP STROH WITHOUT EVIDENCE.

26:30.389 --> 26:33.392
SHE DIDN'T.
GIVE HER SOME TIME.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.027
Brenda:
HER NAME WAS KAREN ONCIDI,

26:35.061 --> 26:38.330
AND SHE WAS
BRUTALLY RAPED AND MURDERED

26:38.364 --> 26:40.232
BEFORE SHE WAS BURIED
IN GRIFFITH PARK,

26:40.266 --> 26:42.601
AS WERE FOUR OTHER GIRLS
OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS.

26:43.736 --> 26:46.706
AND, UH, THE MAN
GIVING KAREN HIS CARD

26:46.739 --> 26:50.209
AT THE PERFUME COUNTER THERE
IS YOU.

26:58.284 --> 26:59.719
YEAH, THAT'S NOT ME.

26:59.752 --> 27:02.088
YOU CARE TO MOVE ON
TO YOUR NEXT LIE?

27:02.121 --> 27:05.624
I HAVE A WITNESS WHO
SAW YOU AT THE CRIME
SCENE, BURYING KAREN.

27:08.327 --> 27:10.162
NO, YOU DON'T...

27:12.031 --> 27:14.801
...OR YOU WOULD HAVE
ARRESTED ME FOR MURDER.

27:14.834 --> 27:17.003
NEXT LIE?
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

27:17.036 --> 27:18.671
HE RECOGNIZED YOU
WHEN YOU TRIED TO PICK HIM UP.

27:18.705 --> 27:23.042
BECAUSE YOU TOLD HIM
TO ACT LIKE HE KNEW ME.

27:23.075 --> 27:25.177
NEXT LIE?

27:25.211 --> 27:29.415
I HAVE DNA FROM THE,
UH,

27:29.448 --> 27:31.217
CAP...

27:31.250 --> 27:34.787
TAKEN OFF THE KILLER
AT THE CRIME SCENE.

27:38.858 --> 27:41.460
IF YOU HAD DNA, YOU WOULD HAVE
CONFIRMED IT AS MINE

27:41.493 --> 27:45.698
BEFORE YOU BROUGHT ME IN, WHICH
YOU WOULD NEED A SAMPLE FOR.

27:45.732 --> 27:47.700
AND YOU DON'T HAVE ONE.

27:49.301 --> 27:50.803
NEXT LIE?

27:52.304 --> 27:55.775
YOU TRIED TO FIND RUSTY TODAY
BECAUSE YOU KNOW --

27:55.808 --> 27:57.143
YOU KNOW --

27:57.176 --> 27:59.045
HE CONNECTS YOU
TO THESE MURDERS.

27:59.078 --> 28:02.448
YOU RELEASED HIS PICTURE TO
THE MEDIA, ALONG WITH HIS NAME.

28:02.481 --> 28:04.316
I SAW THE BOY,
AND I STOPPED.

28:04.350 --> 28:06.786
I WAS GONNA CALL THE L.A.P.D.
ONCE I CONFIRMED WHO HE WAS.

28:06.819 --> 28:07.987
ANYTHING ELSE?

28:09.421 --> 28:11.724
Brenda: I WANT YOU TO LOOK
AT THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL

28:11.758 --> 28:13.459
I'VE COLLECTED
IN LESS THAN 48 HOURS

28:13.492 --> 28:15.427
BECAUSE YOU WERE CARELESS
AND RUSHED AND --

28:15.461 --> 28:17.329
AND YOU LEFT
KAREN'S PURSE BEHIND,

28:17.363 --> 28:20.800
AND THEN I WANT YOU TO IMAGINE
HOW MANY MORE OF YOUR MISTAKES

28:20.833 --> 28:24.270
I WILL DISCOVER WITH THE ENTIRE
JUSTICE SYSTEM AT MY BACK.

28:24.303 --> 28:26.238
REALLY?

28:26.272 --> 28:29.308
WOULD YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE
A SEARCH WARRANT ON YOU...

28:31.410 --> 28:34.713
...WITH THE ENTIRE
JUSTICE SYSTEM AT YOUR BACK?

28:36.115 --> 28:40.519
CHIEF,
I'M GETTING IRRITATED.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.789
WORSE,
I'M GETTING BORED.

28:42.822 --> 28:46.425
SO LET'S REVIEW

28:46.458 --> 28:47.827
THIS VAST COLLECTION

28:47.860 --> 28:49.361
OF SO-CALLED EVIDENCE
YOU'VE ASSEMBLED.

28:49.395 --> 28:51.097
YOU HAVE A BLURRY VIDEO

28:51.130 --> 28:54.433
OF A MAN WALKING AWAY
FROM A PERFUME COUNTER,

28:54.466 --> 28:57.870
AN EYEWITNESS ACCOUNT
GIVEN BY A RUNAWAY BOY

28:57.904 --> 28:59.405
TURNING TRICKS
ON SUNSET BOULEVARD,

28:59.438 --> 29:01.908
AND A WOOLEN CAP.

29:01.941 --> 29:03.542
ONCE AGAIN,
YOU'VE GIVEN ME

29:03.575 --> 29:06.112
EVERY PIECE OF EVIDENCE
THAT YOU HAVE,

29:06.145 --> 29:09.115
AND IT AMOUNTS TO THIS --
I'M LEAVING.

29:09.148 --> 29:10.917
WAIT. WAIT.
SORRY. WE'RE DONE.

29:10.950 --> 29:13.252
WAIT,
MR. STROH, PLEASE.

29:13.285 --> 29:18.157
OKAY, OKAY, MAYBE IT'S NOT YOU,
BUT THIS TYPE OF OFFENDER

29:18.190 --> 29:20.526
IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF PERSON
THAT YOU REPRESENT IN COURT.

29:20.559 --> 29:22.394
WHAT DO YOU THINK
HE'S UP TO?

29:22.428 --> 29:25.331
OBVIOUSLY, HE ENJOYS KILLING
WOMEN DURING SEXUAL INTERCOURSE.

29:25.364 --> 29:27.867
IT'S NOT SEX. IT'S RAPE.
PO-TAY-TO, PO-TAH-TO.

29:27.900 --> 29:30.903
LET'S NOT GET ALL BOGGED DOWN
IN POLITICAL CORRECTNESS.

29:33.572 --> 29:36.408
HE PREPARES THE GRAVES
IN ADVANCE,

29:36.442 --> 29:38.477
CHARMS THESE WOMEN TO A REMOTE
AREA IN GRIFFITH PARK,

29:38.510 --> 29:41.147
MAYBE BY TELLING THEM THAT
HE'S GONNA TAKE THEIR PICTURE.

29:42.448 --> 29:44.851
ANY IDEA WHY HE WOULD GO
TO SO MUCH TROUBLE, SIR?

29:44.884 --> 29:46.352
Stroh: WELL, WHAT YOU CALL
"SO MUCH TROUBLE,"

29:46.385 --> 29:48.354
YOUR KILLER
PROBABLY CONSIDERS...

29:48.387 --> 29:50.189
FOREPLAY.

29:54.260 --> 29:56.228
OH...

29:56.262 --> 30:00.933
AND SINCE YOU'VE BEEN SO KIND
AS TO KEEP CLOSE TABS ON ME,

30:00.967 --> 30:03.169
I'VE RETURNED THE FAVOR.

30:03.202 --> 30:04.436
AND I'D HATE TO LEAVE
WITHOUT SAYING

30:04.470 --> 30:07.473
HOW SORRY I WAS
TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR MOTHER.

30:15.514 --> 30:17.216
CHIEF!

30:20.887 --> 30:22.188
CHIEF!

30:22.221 --> 30:23.956
CHIEF!

30:30.362 --> 30:31.964
BRENDA!

30:34.500 --> 30:36.936
COME ON!
OPEN THE DOOR!

30:36.969 --> 30:38.504
GET HER OUT!

30:39.638 --> 30:40.873
CHIEF, COME ON!

30:43.242 --> 30:44.877
COME ON.

30:44.911 --> 30:47.980
WE'LL GET YOU TO A DOCTOR.
CAPTAIN, WILL YOU HANDLE THIS?

30:53.419 --> 30:54.486
CHIEF.

30:54.520 --> 30:55.888
I KNOW. I KNOW.

30:55.922 --> 30:57.990
I'M SUSPENDED,
PENDING AN INVESTIGATION

30:58.024 --> 31:01.260
OF MY PROFESSIONAL
STANDARDS FOR...

31:01.293 --> 31:03.495
UNWARRANTED PHYSICAL ATTACK
ON A MURDER SUSPECT.

31:03.529 --> 31:06.432
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA,
WOULD YOU PLEASE SEE TO IT

31:06.465 --> 31:07.499
THAT RUSTY IS PICKED UP
BY DDA HOBBS?

31:09.936 --> 31:12.338
EXCUSE ME.
THANK Y'ALL SO MUCH.

31:23.415 --> 31:24.951
COME IN.

31:24.984 --> 31:28.454
OH, CHIEF JOHNSON.
STILL WORKING ON YOUR VICTIMS.

31:28.487 --> 31:30.356
OH, MY GOD,
WHAT

31:30.389 --> 31:32.691
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
YOU HAVE BLOOD ON YOU.
YES, I DO.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.660
AND I NEED YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'M NOT HERE OFFICIALLY.

31:34.693 --> 31:37.496
I'VE BEEN SUSPENDED
AND PROBABLY FIRED.

31:37.529 --> 31:39.531
OH, MY GOD.
AND I HATE TO INVOLVE YOU,

31:39.565 --> 31:41.400
BUT I NEED YOU
TO TAKE THE BLOOD OFF ME

31:41.433 --> 31:44.570
A-AND THE HAIR FOLLICLES THAT
ARE UNDERNEATH MY FINGERNAILS

31:44.603 --> 31:47.439
AND PUT THEM IN A WOOLEN CAP
TO FAKE DNA SAMPLES.

31:47.473 --> 31:50.376
SO, YOU -- YOU WANT --
YOU WANT ME TO PLANT EVIDENCE?

31:50.409 --> 31:51.643
B-BECAUSE THAT'S ILLEGAL.

31:51.677 --> 31:53.012
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
IT'S NOT.

31:53.745 --> 31:56.515
UH,
JUST OPEN THE DOOR.

31:58.084 --> 32:01.320
HELLO, DOCTOR.
NEED SOME REASSURANCE?

32:01.353 --> 32:04.090
UH, PLEASE.

32:04.123 --> 32:06.392
WE'RE PUTTING THE BLOOD AND
THE HAIR FOLLICLES IN THIS CAP

32:06.425 --> 32:09.428
SO WE CAN FORCE MR. STROH
BACK INTO AN INTERVIEW.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.464
IF HE BELIEVES
WE HAVE DNA EVIDENCE

32:12.498 --> 32:14.400
AND WE CAN TIE THE CAP
TO THE CRIME SCENE,
HE MIGHT MAKE A DEAL.

32:14.433 --> 32:19.105
WE CAN NEVER PROSECUTE
STROH WITH THIS DNA
OR EVEN ARREST HIM,

32:19.138 --> 32:21.607
BUT IF IT'S ONLY FOR USE
IN AN INTERVIEW, WE'RE GOOD.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.709
BUT NOT IN A COURTROOM?

32:23.742 --> 32:25.577
NO, NO, NO,
JUST TO GET A CONFESSION.

32:25.611 --> 32:28.514
WE FOUND
STROH'S LITTLE CEMETERY.

32:28.547 --> 32:31.050
WE CAUGHT HIM RED-HANDED,
TRYING TO MURDER THAT BOY,

32:31.083 --> 32:33.319
AND I JUST RATTLED HIS CAGE
PRETTY HARD.

32:33.352 --> 32:36.322
A-A-AND IF HE SEES THAT HOBBS
HAS THAT CAP WITH HIS DNA IN IT,

32:36.355 --> 32:38.524
THAT'S GONNA PUSH HIM
RIGHT OVER THE EDGE.

32:44.496 --> 32:45.464
PLEASE.

32:45.497 --> 32:47.066
GET THIS STUFF OFF OF ME,

32:47.099 --> 32:50.102
AND LET'S PUT IT SOMEWHERE
WHERE IT CAN DO SOME GOOD.

32:56.408 --> 32:58.644
OKAY.

33:01.113 --> 33:02.714
PUT YOUR HANDS UP,
WHERE I CAN SEE THEM.

33:02.748 --> 33:04.483
GOD, I SOUND LIKE A COP.

33:07.086 --> 33:08.554
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

33:10.056 --> 33:12.458
IT'S BEEN A REAL PLEASURE
WORKING WITH YOU.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.393
LIKEWISE.

33:14.426 --> 33:16.628
NOW, BE QUIET.

33:16.662 --> 33:19.498
MY PATIENTS TALK TO ME, I RUN
SCREAMING FROM THE BUILDING.

33:19.531 --> 33:20.566
OH.

33:21.733 --> 33:25.371
Rusty:
IT'S CREEPY IN HERE.

33:25.404 --> 33:27.639
I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHY I HAD TO COME.

33:27.673 --> 33:30.809
ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT
SOMEONE'S TRYING TO KILL YOU,

33:30.842 --> 33:34.513
WE NEED YOU TO SAY
ON THE RECORD, OUT LOUD,

33:34.546 --> 33:36.082
WHERE YOU GOT THE CAP.

33:36.115 --> 33:38.684
LOOK, YOU BRING MY MOM BACK,
AND I WILL DO WHAT YOU WANT.

33:41.420 --> 33:42.621
I'M NOT HAVING MUCH LUCK
OUT HERE.

33:42.654 --> 33:44.723
LEAVE HIM TO ME.

33:44.756 --> 33:47.526
I'LL BE SURE TO GET YOU
MY NOTES ON STROH

33:47.559 --> 33:49.761
SO, WHEN YOU SIT DOWN
WITH HIM, YOU CAN...

33:53.565 --> 33:58.404
LOOK, THE D.A.'s OFFICE
NEEDS A NEW CHIEF

33:58.437 --> 34:00.106
FOR OUR BUREAU
OF INVESTIGATION.

34:00.139 --> 34:01.607
MY BOSS WOULD BE THRILLED
TO OFFER YOU THE POSITION.

34:01.640 --> 34:04.176
OF COURSE, YOU'D MAINLY
BE AN ADMINISTRATOR,

34:04.210 --> 34:06.778
BUT YOU COULD
GET INTO THE TRENCHES, TOO,

34:06.812 --> 34:08.780
NOW AND THEN,
IF YOU WANTED.

34:10.582 --> 34:13.085
COULD I BRING
SOMEONE FROM MY TEAM?

34:13.119 --> 34:15.721
DOES THAT MEAN
YOU'LL CONSIDER THE OFFER?

34:15.754 --> 34:19.791
WELL, I -- I GUESS
I'LL NEED A NEW JOB.

34:19.825 --> 34:21.760
I DON'T KNOW. I...

34:21.793 --> 34:24.796
UH, I'LL NEED TO THINK
ABOUT IT.

34:28.200 --> 34:30.536
OKAY, RUSTY,
COME WITH ME.

34:30.569 --> 34:33.272
I'D CALL STROH,
LET HIM KNOW WHAT'S COMING.

34:35.807 --> 34:37.643
NO, NO, HONEY,
DON'T LOOK AT THAT.

34:42.614 --> 34:44.216
STROH: Hello?

34:44.250 --> 34:47.153
PHILLIP? DDA HOBBS.
Oh. How are you today?

34:47.186 --> 34:49.721
VERY WELL.
THANK YOU FOR ASKING.

34:49.755 --> 34:53.759
LISTEN, WE'VE FOUND DNA
FROM TWO DISTINCT INDIVIDUALS

34:53.792 --> 34:55.861
IN AN INTERESTING WOOLEN CAP,

34:55.894 --> 34:58.897
AND I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU COULD COME BY

34:58.930 --> 35:02.201
AND GIVE US A CHEEK SWAB...
JUST FOR FUN.

35:05.904 --> 35:10.709
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN
REALLY HUNGRY.

35:10.742 --> 35:12.644
NO ONE HAS EVER ASKED
FOR A SECOND HELPING

35:12.678 --> 35:13.745
OF MY CLAM LINGUINE.

35:13.779 --> 35:17.149
REALLY?
TASTES GREAT TO ME.

35:18.684 --> 35:22.221
NOW, HOW IS IT DIFFERENT
FROM SPAGHETTI

35:23.255 --> 35:24.790
IT'S, UM...

35:24.823 --> 35:25.891
IT...

35:25.924 --> 35:28.760
UH...

35:28.794 --> 35:32.231
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.

35:32.264 --> 35:36.702
SOMETHING TO DO WITH
THE NOODLES -- THEIR SHAPE.

35:39.305 --> 35:42.841
LOOK...RUSTY...

35:42.874 --> 35:44.710
BRENDA.

35:44.743 --> 35:47.246
I NEED YOUR HELP.

35:47.279 --> 35:50.782
NO. I NEED YOUR HELP.

35:50.816 --> 35:52.684
YOU WERE
IN THE MURDER ROOM TODAY.

35:52.718 --> 35:54.620
YOU SAW THE PICTURES
OF THOSE WOMEN.

35:54.653 --> 35:55.754
YOU KNOW HOW THEY DIED.

35:55.787 --> 35:58.524
YOU EVEN SAW ONE OF THEM
BEING BURIED.

35:58.557 --> 36:01.660
NOW, THE GUY WHO DID ALL THAT --
HE WANTS TO KILL YOU, TOO.

36:01.693 --> 36:03.329
YEAH, IS THIS
ABOUT THE HAT AGAIN?

36:03.362 --> 36:05.264
I'VE TOLD YOU,
YOU BRING MY MOTHER BACK,

36:05.297 --> 36:07.966
AND I TELL YOU
EXACTLY HOW I GOT IT.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.701
I HAVE PEOPLE HUNTING
FOR YOUR MOTHER RIGHT NOW,

36:09.735 --> 36:11.237
BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE MORE TIME
THAN YOU REALIZE.

36:11.270 --> 36:13.205
LOOK, LOOK, OKAY,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

36:13.239 --> 36:15.674
IF I HELP YOU,
THEN I LOSE ALL OF MY LEVERAGE,

36:15.707 --> 36:18.844
AND I NEED --
I NEED MY MOTHER TO COME BACK.

36:18.877 --> 36:21.947
I NEED TO -- TO TELL HER
THAT I CAN BE BETTER,

36:21.980 --> 36:24.750
TO -- TO SHOW HER
THAT I CAN PAY ATTENTION

36:24.783 --> 36:26.818
AND TO PROVE TO HER
THAT I CAN CHANGE,
BECAUSE I CAN CHANGE.

36:26.852 --> 36:28.820
PLEASE.

36:28.854 --> 36:30.722
LOOK, RUSTY, WHAT HAPPENED
WITH YOUR MOTHER --

36:30.756 --> 36:32.624
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOU.

36:32.658 --> 36:33.759
SHE MADE A MISTAKE.

36:33.792 --> 36:34.926
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.762
YES, I DO.
I-I DO KNOW THAT.

36:36.795 --> 36:39.698
YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON WHO'S BEEN
DEALING WITH BAD PEOPLE.

36:39.731 --> 36:41.233
OKAY,
BUT THAT'S THE THING.

36:41.267 --> 36:42.901
I'M NOT --
I'M NOT JUST DEALING WITH THEM.

36:42.934 --> 36:47.806
IT IS -- IT IS BECOMING
A PART OF WHO I AM....

36:47.839 --> 36:49.841
AND I CAN'T GO ON
LIKE THAT.

36:49.875 --> 36:52.811
I CAN'T.

36:54.713 --> 36:57.683
CAN'T YOU HELP ME?
PLEASE.

36:57.716 --> 36:58.950
I CAN, AND I WILL.

37:00.286 --> 37:04.290
BUT W-WE NEED TO TALK
ABOUT THESE WOMEN WHO ARE --

37:04.323 --> 37:06.592
THEY'RE DEAD!
DON'T YOU GET IT?!

37:06.625 --> 37:09.328
THEY ARE DEAD!
YOU CAN'T HELP THEM ANYMORE!

37:09.361 --> 37:10.896
OR IS IT JUST THAT YOU DON'T
WANT TO BOTHER WITH ME?

37:10.929 --> 37:14.866
IS THAT IT? YOU JUST WANT TO
USE ME LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE?

37:14.900 --> 37:17.969
DON'T SAY THAT.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
ISN'T IT?

37:18.003 --> 37:21.307
I MEAN, YOU HAVEN'T
EVEN ASKED ONE REAL
QUESTION ABOUT MY LIFE --

37:21.340 --> 37:22.774
NOT EVEN A, YOU KNOW,
"GOSH, RUSTY,

37:22.808 --> 37:25.010
"WHAT A CRAPPY SITUATION
YOU'VE GOT,

37:25.043 --> 37:28.647
HAVING TO SPEND YOUR
16th BIRTHDAY WORKING
AS A STREET TREAT."

37:28.680 --> 37:32.651
DO YOU KNOW, I WON THREE
CHESS TROPHIES IN SIXTH GRADE...

37:32.684 --> 37:34.886
AND TWO IN THE SEVENTH?
OR NO?

37:34.920 --> 37:36.288
OR, NO, DO YOU --
DO YOU ONLY KNOW

37:36.322 --> 37:37.889
HOW TO CARE ABOUT PEOPLE
AFTER THEY DIE?

37:37.923 --> 37:40.025
IS THAT IT?
IT'S MY JOB
TO CARE ABOUT DEAD PEOPLE.

37:40.058 --> 37:43.662
NOT ANYMORE! IT'S NOT YOUR JOB!
YOU'RE FIRED!

37:47.699 --> 37:48.967
OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.654
I'LL NOT ONLY
LOOK FOR YOUR MOTHER MYSELF,

38:08.687 --> 38:11.657
I'LL GET THE FBI INVOLVED.
OKAY?

38:11.690 --> 38:13.291
WE'LL DO A NATIONAL SEARCH.

38:37.082 --> 38:40.952
LET'S NOT TALK ANYMORE
ABOUT THE HAT TONIGHT.

38:42.087 --> 38:44.790
WE'RE BOTH TIRED.

38:47.993 --> 38:50.362
HOW ABOUT SOME DESSERT
IF YOU'RE STILL HUNGRY?

38:50.396 --> 38:53.465
HUH?

38:55.734 --> 38:58.103
HOW DOES THAT SOUND?

38:58.136 --> 39:00.071
DOES THAT SOUND GOOD TO YOU?

39:00.105 --> 39:02.874
HUH

39:12.484 --> 39:14.486
MAYBE RUSTY'S RIGHT.
IS HE?

39:14.520 --> 39:16.154
WOULD YOU CARE ABOUT HIM MORE
IF HE WERE DEAD?

39:16.187 --> 39:19.057
'CAUSE WE CAN FIND OUT
RIGHT NOW.

39:19.090 --> 39:21.793
NO, DON'T! DON'T!
OR YOU CAN SIT DOWN
AT THE TABLE.

39:21.827 --> 39:24.396
DON'T. PHILLIP, PLEASE.

39:24.430 --> 39:26.164
NICE.
USING MY FIRST NAME.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.900
I BET YOU LEARNED THAT
AT QUANTICO. HUH, BRENDA?

39:28.934 --> 39:33.739
WHICH REMINDS ME, I KNOW YOUR
HUSBAND'S AWAY, OFF IN D.C.,

39:33.772 --> 39:35.541
SO SIT DOWN AT THE TABLE

39:35.574 --> 39:37.443
OR I WILL SLIT THIS KID'S THROAT
RIGHT NOW.

39:37.476 --> 39:38.910
OKAY, OKAY.
I'M SITTING. I'M SITTING.

39:38.944 --> 39:42.147
ON YOUR HANDS.

39:42.180 --> 39:44.049
LOOK, THERE'S NO REAL EVIDENCE
AGAINST YOU.

39:44.082 --> 39:48.487
I -- I ATTACKED YOU TODAY ON --
ON THE ELEVATOR ON PURPOSE.

39:48.520 --> 39:51.923
AND THE DNA THAT -- THAT HOBBS
TOLD YOU THAT SHE HAD --

39:51.957 --> 39:52.991
THAT'S WHERE IT CAME FROM.

39:56.127 --> 39:58.530
YOU ALWAYS LIE.

39:59.565 --> 40:03.001
WHO CAN TRUST YOU
RIGHT, RUSTY?

40:03.034 --> 40:04.803
ANYWAY,
THE CAP ONLY MATTERS

40:04.836 --> 40:07.038
IF THE KID SAYS
HE PULLED IT OFF MY HEAD,

40:07.072 --> 40:09.074
AND IF YOU'RE NOT AROUND
AND IF HE CAN'T TALK --

40:09.107 --> 40:10.576
NO, NO, DON'T, DON'T!

40:10.609 --> 40:13.044
RUSTY, RUSTY,
DON'T STRUGGLE.

40:13.078 --> 40:14.980
LET YOUR BODY GO SLACK.

40:20.486 --> 40:22.187
THAT'S RIGHT.
SHE'S RIGHT, RUSTY.

40:22.220 --> 40:24.089
I GOT NOTHING PERSONAL
AGAINST YOU.

40:24.122 --> 40:25.524
MATTER OF FACT,
I'M REALLY SORRY.

40:25.557 --> 40:27.058
UGH! OH!

40:27.092 --> 40:29.561
AAH!
UGH!

41:17.609 --> 41:19.010
CALL AN AMBULANCE.

41:28.920 --> 41:31.523
IF YOU LET ME DIE
LIKE THIS

41:31.557 --> 41:34.593
THE KID'S TESTIMONY
CAN PUT YOU IN PRISON.

41:34.626 --> 41:36.127
SHOOT HIM!
SHOOT HIM AGAIN!

41:36.161 --> 41:38.964
I THINK
I COULD GET AWAY WITH IT.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.866
YOU BROKE INTO MY HOUSE,

41:40.899 --> 41:42.233
YOU THREATENED ME,
YOU STABBED THE KID.

41:42.267 --> 41:43.268
IT'S SELF-DEFENSE.

41:43.301 --> 41:45.604
OKAY. OKAY.

41:46.638 --> 41:48.640
I'LL -- I'LL TELL YOU
EVERYTHING.

42:03.722 --> 42:05.123
YOU KNOW WHAT?

42:05.156 --> 42:09.227
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

42:16.367 --> 42:20.038
THIS IS DEPUTY CHIEF
BRENDA LEIGH JOHNSON, L.A.P.D.

42:20.071 --> 42:22.540
OFFICER NEEDS HELP.
I NEED, UH...

42:24.142 --> 42:27.178
I NEED TWO AMBULANCES,
A PARAMEDIC, AND BACKUP

42:27.212 --> 42:31.683
AT 3882 NORTH RIDGECREST,
LOS ANGELES, 90036.

42:33.619 --> 42:35.621
NO, MA'AM.
I SHOT SOMEBODY.

42:45.797 --> 42:46.698
HAVE YOU EXPLAINED
THAT F.I.D. COULD CLEAR HER

42:48.634 --> 42:50.201
FOR THE SHOOTING
AT HER HOME,

42:50.235 --> 42:52.303
IF FOR NO OTHER REASON
THAN SHE SAVED THE BOY'S LIFE?

42:52.337 --> 42:53.939
I DID, BUT THE CITY ATTORNEY
STILL DEMANDS

42:53.972 --> 42:55.206
THAT WE ISSUE
A FORMAL REPRIMAND

42:55.240 --> 42:58.944
FOR ATTACKING PHILLIP STROH
IN THE ELEVATOR.

42:58.977 --> 43:00.378
AND CHIEF JOHNSON
REFUSES TO COOPERATE.

43:00.411 --> 43:02.681
WELL, THAT'S NOT
ENTIRELY TRUE.

43:02.714 --> 43:06.151
I'VE SPOKEN TO HER AT LEAST
TWICE A DAY FOR THE PAST WEEK,

43:06.184 --> 43:08.687
TRYING TO ARRANGE
A PROPER CUSTODIAL ENVIRONMENT

43:08.720 --> 43:10.689
FOR YOUR MATERIAL WITNESS,
RUSTY BECK.

43:10.722 --> 43:12.090
SHE'S COOPERATING WITH ME.

43:12.123 --> 43:15.694
CHIEF JOHNSON OBJECTS
TO THE REPRIMAND.

43:15.727 --> 43:19.798
SO MAY I ASK, IS THERE
NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE HERE?

43:24.402 --> 43:27.172
HONESTLY, CAPTAIN,
THIS, UH...

43:27.205 --> 43:29.708
THIS MIGHT BE
FOR THE BEST.

43:29.741 --> 43:32.377
IF WE WANT MAJOR CRIMES
TO OPERATE

43:32.410 --> 43:36.347
WITHOUT HUGE LIABILITY ISSUES
HANGING OVER OUR HEADS,

43:36.381 --> 43:37.983
WE NEED TO RESTRUCTURE IT,

43:38.016 --> 43:42.120
AND I NEED YOU TO BE
A VERY BIG PART OF THAT.

43:42.153 --> 43:44.289
Pope: BESIDES WHICH,
THIS MORNING,

43:44.322 --> 43:46.692
CHIEF JOHNSON
GAVE ME THIS LETTER

43:46.725 --> 43:50.295
IN THE EVENT THAT HER REPRIMAND
COULD NOT BE DISMISSED.

43:52.263 --> 43:55.400
SHE HAS A GREAT JOB OFFER FROM
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.

43:55.433 --> 43:58.303
SHE'D LIKE TO HAVE
DETECTIVE GABRIEL TRANSFERRED

43:58.336 --> 44:01.206
TO BE HER L.A.P.D.
LIAISON OFFICER.

44:01.239 --> 44:03.809
AND, UH...

44:03.842 --> 44:06.778
YOU CAN READ IT.

44:14.085 --> 44:17.789
"I THANK YOU ALL...

44:17.823 --> 44:19.791
"FOR THE HONOR
YOU BESTOWED ON ME,

44:19.825 --> 44:22.393
ALLOWING ME TO LEAD THIS
DIVISION AS DEPUTY CHIEF..."

44:22.427 --> 44:23.695
"...FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS.

44:23.729 --> 44:25.430
"ONCE I COME BACK
FROM ATLANTA,

44:25.463 --> 44:29.434
"I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH
ALL OF YOU AGAIN IN MY NEW JOB

44:29.467 --> 44:32.370
AS CHIEF OF THE D.A.'s
BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION."

44:34.072 --> 44:36.808
"SINCERELY YOURS,
BRENDA LEIGH JOHNSON."

44:36.842 --> 44:39.144
THAT'S THE OFFICIAL STORY,
ANYWAY.

44:39.177 --> 44:40.345
STROH WOULDN'T
BE ABLE TO COMPLAIN

44:40.378 --> 44:41.780
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
IN THE ELEVATOR

44:41.813 --> 44:43.048
IF YOU'D ONLY KILLED HIM,
CHIEF.

44:43.081 --> 44:44.449
Fritz:
OH, NO, BETTER SHE LEAVES

44:44.482 --> 44:47.185
WHILE TAKING CONFESSIONS
INSTEAD OF GIVING ONE.

44:48.319 --> 44:51.322
I'M GONNA PUT THIS STUFF
IN THE CAR.

44:51.356 --> 44:53.424
IF YOU GUYS NEED TO GET IN TOUCH
WITH HER WHILE SHE'S IN ATLANTA,

44:53.458 --> 44:55.160
GO THROUGH THE FBI.

44:55.193 --> 44:57.062
NOW, GO ON, GUYS.

44:57.095 --> 44:59.297
GIVE HER YOUR GIFT.

45:00.766 --> 45:03.434
LET HER GO.
OH, NO GIFTS.

45:03.468 --> 45:06.471
AWW, I SHOULD BE
GIVING Y'ALL GIFTS.

45:06.504 --> 45:08.106
I DON'T --
I DON'T NEED A GIFT.

45:09.107 --> 45:11.409
I JUST...

45:14.212 --> 45:15.213
MIKE...

45:16.281 --> 45:18.183
...JULIO...

45:19.350 --> 45:20.718
...DAVID...

45:21.853 --> 45:23.221
...ANDY...

45:23.254 --> 45:24.322
BUZZ...

45:26.391 --> 45:27.425
...LIEUTENANT...

45:28.526 --> 45:30.295
SORRY.

45:30.328 --> 45:32.130
I STILL HAVE TO CALL YOU
LIEUTENANT.

45:32.163 --> 45:33.731
OH,
SO DO MY GRANDKIDS.

45:35.166 --> 45:37.435
THE ONLY GIFT
I WANT FROM YOU...

45:38.403 --> 45:40.438
...IS YOUR FRIENDSHIP.

45:42.540 --> 45:44.810
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
WHAT WE GOT YOU, CHIEF.

45:44.843 --> 45:48.246
IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT YOUR
LEAVING PUTS PROVENZA IN CHARGE.

45:48.279 --> 45:50.481
WAIT, WAIT,
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

45:50.515 --> 45:53.151
I HEAR RUMORS, SO...

45:53.184 --> 45:54.285
WE'LL SEE.

45:56.521 --> 45:58.556
Tao: WELL, WE DIDN'T GET YOU
A GOLD WATCH OR ANYTHING,

45:58.589 --> 46:00.859
'CAUSE WE DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE LEAVING.

46:00.892 --> 46:03.461
I MEAN...
DO YOU HAVE TO?

46:03.494 --> 46:05.563
I MEAN...LEAVE.

46:05.596 --> 46:07.232
I MEAN, REALLY?

46:07.265 --> 46:09.300
YES.

46:10.568 --> 46:12.871
I NEED TO SPEND
SOME MORE TIME...

46:12.904 --> 46:14.439
THINKING ABOUT THE LIVING.

46:16.307 --> 46:20.946
NOW, Y'ALL FIND RUSTY'S MOTHER,
LIKE I PROMISED HIM WE WOULD,

46:20.979 --> 46:23.548
AND WHEN I COME BACK
FROM ATLANTA,

46:23.581 --> 46:25.283
WE'LL -- I'LL --

46:25.316 --> 46:27.352
I'LL ONLY BE WORKING
DOWN THE STREET A WAYS.
