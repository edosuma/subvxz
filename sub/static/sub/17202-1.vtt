00:40.332 --> 00:43.506
Well, thanks for the information.
I appreciate it.

00:43.669 --> 00:45.512
There's no chance a mistake
could've been made?

00:45.671 --> 00:48.299
A misreading? Human error?
It happens.

00:49.591 --> 00:50.888
Oh.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.179
Well, that sort of rules that
out, then, doesn't it?

00:54.346 --> 00:57.065
So this really is a reality.

01:00.686 --> 01:02.529
Mr. Secretary, your car.

01:04.063 --> 01:05.907
Ah, yes. Thank you.

01:18.579 --> 01:22.209
Eddie, let's take the parkway.

01:28.297 --> 01:31.551
Okay, buddy. Final offer.
Non-negotiable.

01:31.717 --> 01:34.220
For every buckle-down hour
you give Algebra Two,

01:34.386 --> 01:37.435
you get two of quality time with
Nintendo and Sega.

01:37.598 --> 01:38.941
Deal?

01:39.099 --> 01:42.694
Heh. Just whatever you do,
don't tell your mother.

01:42.853 --> 01:45.572
Good. Now, put her back on.

01:47.399 --> 01:52.246
Okay, hon. Number one son
back on the straight and narrow.

01:52.404 --> 01:56.500
Me? Fine. Just needed a little
field trip to clear the head.

01:56.658 --> 01:59.252
Bit of a nightmare day.

01:59.411 --> 02:01.459
I'll see you in a bit.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.420
You bet.

02:03.582 --> 02:05.175
I love you, Liz.

03:38.176 --> 03:40.804
This is a very dynamic game,
Mr. Depina.

03:40.971 --> 03:42.348
<i>You can be honest, Angela.</i>

03:42.514 --> 03:44.312
<i>This game is as bloody as it gets.</i>

03:44.474 --> 03:46.647
<i>But believe me,
the kids will eat this up.</i>

03:46.810 --> 03:50.314
<i>But first you gotta tell me
what keeps crashing the damn thing.</i>

03:52.941 --> 03:57.663
Well, you have been virused, Mr. Depina,
and a not so very nice one.

03:57.821 --> 04:00.745
<i>You are the best. I knew I could
count on you. So, what should we do?</i>

04:00.907 --> 04:04.537
Well, don't think about hitting the escape
key on any of your systems for a while.

04:04.703 --> 04:06.831
One keystroke will wipe out
your whole system.

04:06.997 --> 04:10.357
<i>I don't know how these things happen. I just
ordered that security program last week.</i>

04:10.375 --> 04:12.218
<i>What's it called?
Gatekeeper?</i>

04:12.377 --> 04:15.256
Well, that's what they all say.
Did you install it?

04:15.422 --> 04:17.220
<i>Absolutely.
The minute we got it.</i>

04:17.382 --> 04:18.759
<i>I think.</i>

04:18.925 --> 04:21.428
Not to worry. Everything's under
control. It's gonna be okay.

04:21.595 --> 04:22.642
<i>You're the best, Angela.</i>

04:22.804 --> 04:25.478
<i>Now, do you think we'll be able to get
this back in stores by week's end?</i>

04:25.640 --> 04:28.314
Absolutely.
Everything but the virus.

04:28.477 --> 04:29.729
A friend of mine collects them.

04:29.895 --> 04:31.693
I don't know,
some people save string.

04:31.855 --> 04:35.200
<i>You are a genius, Angela.
I can't thank you enough.</i>

04:35.358 --> 04:37.986
Yeah, well, you might think differently
once you get my bill from Cathedral.

04:38.153 --> 04:39.553
<i>Look, whatever it is,
it's worth it.</i>

04:39.654 --> 04:41.998
<i>Angela, I'd love to show
you my appreciation,</i>

04:42.157 --> 04:45.752
<i>take you out to dinner tonight,
some drinks. Get you out of the house.</i>

04:45.911 --> 04:48.585
Oh, I'm very flattered
and appreciative, but I...

04:48.747 --> 04:50.590
<i>You gotta eat.</i>

04:50.749 --> 04:54.549
Uh, it's... Unfortunately,
I already have dinner plans, so...

04:54.711 --> 04:57.760
<i>How about tomorrow?
The next day?</i>

04:57.923 --> 05:01.223
Um, these plans are kind of
a standing arrangement,

05:01.384 --> 05:04.433
but I appreciate it.
Thank you.

05:04.596 --> 05:05.688
<i>Look, you're still the best, Angela.</i>
I'll speak to you soon.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.975
<i>Thanks. Bye now.</i>
Bye-bye.

05:16.441 --> 05:17.488
Hello.

05:20.070 --> 05:23.199
Large. Garlic?

05:23.365 --> 05:25.242
Garlic.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.374
Thank you.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.511
<i>No one leaves the house anymore.</i>

06:18.670 --> 06:20.889
<i>No one has sex.</i>

06:21.047 --> 06:23.516
<i>The Net is ultimate condom.</i>

06:27.304 --> 06:28.351
Come on.

06:28.513 --> 06:32.859
Talk like that, Iceman, could lead to
the eventual extinction of our species.

06:33.018 --> 06:35.737
<i>My sympathies exactly, Angel.</i>

06:35.896 --> 06:38.024
<i>Let's have a date and procreate.</i>

06:38.189 --> 06:42.365
Not me. In two days,
I'm off on vacation.

06:42.527 --> 06:47.875
Just me, the beach and a book.

06:49.534 --> 06:52.287
<i>I'm there, babe.
Look no further.</i>

06:52.454 --> 06:55.003
Sorry. Not my type.

06:56.499 --> 07:00.220
<i>I'm crushed. So, what do you
want in a man?</i>

07:00.378 --> 07:01.379
Hmm.

07:04.341 --> 07:07.311
Butch. Beautiful.

07:10.639 --> 07:11.982
Brilliant.

07:14.184 --> 07:20.908
Captain America
meets Albert Schweitzer.

07:21.107 --> 07:26.284
Spends all day dashing into fray

07:26.446 --> 07:30.292
while making world

07:30.450 --> 07:33.704
safe for democracy.

07:33.870 --> 07:38.842
At night, playing Bach Cantatas

07:39.000 --> 07:43.551
while curing cancer.

07:43.713 --> 07:46.637
<i>Settle for a guy who
puts the seat down?</i>

07:48.718 --> 07:50.937
<i>Listen, Angel, you're dreaming.</i>

07:51.096 --> 07:52.769
<i>You're one of us.</i>

07:52.931 --> 07:55.309
<i>We accept you.
We accept her.</i>

07:55.475 --> 07:58.979
<i>- You're one of us.
- One of us.</i>

07:59.145 --> 08:00.567
Yeah, I know.

08:34.139 --> 08:38.986
It's beautiful.
It's beautiful. I love Chopin.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.395
You know this piece?

08:40.562 --> 08:43.190
Well, I should.
You taught it to me.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.699
Brought you something.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.789
Just don't let the nurses
eat it all this time.

08:54.951 --> 08:58.171
My favorite.
How did you know?

08:59.789 --> 09:01.757
Mm.

09:04.044 --> 09:07.969
Do you wanna...
We could play together. Do you...

09:38.328 --> 09:41.423
Now, I'm going on vacation for
about a week to the Yucatán.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.004
If for any reason you need
to get in touch with me,

09:44.167 --> 09:45.510
I don't know if they have phones there,

09:45.668 --> 09:48.171
but you can talk to one
of the nurses and I'll...

09:48.338 --> 09:50.932
You must be one of my students.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.059
No, Mom, my name's Angela.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.095
Can you bring me some candy

09:59.224 --> 10:01.101
when you come again?

10:04.312 --> 10:06.986
My favorites are those...
Almond Rosa.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.236
Yeah, I know what
your favorites are.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.333
Angela Bennett!

10:24.499 --> 10:26.217
- Who is it?
- FedEx!

10:26.376 --> 10:27.423
<i>Thank you for using</i>
Coming.

10:27.585 --> 10:30.634
<i>our reservation service.
Have a pleasant flight.</i>

10:36.261 --> 10:37.888
Hi.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.806
Hi.
Line five, please.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.028
Oh, I have another one going out.

10:45.186 --> 10:47.530
Okay. Here you go, ma'am.
Thanks.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.578
And here's your virus, Dale.

10:59.576 --> 11:02.204
Can I use your pen?
Yeah, sure.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.168
This is a nice place.

11:05.290 --> 11:06.507
Thanks.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.596
Have a nice day, ma'am. Bye-bye.
You too.

11:43.453 --> 11:44.454
<i>Mozart's ghost!</i>
Thank you.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.294
<i>The hottest band
on the Internet!</i>

11:55.465 --> 11:56.637
Cathedral Software.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.120
Dale Hessman, please.
<i>Please hold.</i>

12:00.511 --> 12:02.229
Hello.
<i>Hi, it's Angela.</i>

12:02.388 --> 12:03.605
Angela?

12:03.765 --> 12:06.644
FedEx Ship Software had you
signing for that disk three minutes ago.

12:06.809 --> 12:08.152
What took you so long?

12:08.311 --> 12:12.737
Well, I was having way too much
fun with this Mozart's Ghost.

12:12.899 --> 12:16.324
By the way, I sent you a whopper
of a virus for your hall of fame.

12:16.486 --> 12:19.035
Just be a little careful with
the escape button.

12:19.197 --> 12:23.873
Look, here's the problem.
Pop yourself into concert information.

12:24.035 --> 12:26.379
All right.

12:26.537 --> 12:30.792
Houston Utilities. Um, Dale,
I think you took a wrong turn here.

12:30.959 --> 12:34.338
Not quite Ticketmaster, is it?
See anything unusual?

12:34.504 --> 12:39.055
Mmm, no. Looks like a normal
web page to me, except for that little...

12:39.217 --> 12:41.140
What is that? A little icon at
the bottom of the screen?

12:41.302 --> 12:43.396
Click on it, and then press
control-shift.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.861
My God.
<i>So, what do you make of all this?</i>

12:54.023 --> 12:56.572
Simple.
It's a programing glitch.

12:56.734 --> 12:59.533
Just a futzed keystroke that sends you
to the wrong Internet address, that's all.

12:59.696 --> 13:03.701
Last night it sent me to Amtrak's central
mainframe and then the Mayo Clinic.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.868
Neither of them
are on the same subnet.

13:06.035 --> 13:08.629
<i>Angela, I've accessed a system
I shouldn't have.</i>

13:08.788 --> 13:12.042
<i>If someone gets ahold of that disk,
they'd have an awful lot of power.</i>

13:12.208 --> 13:14.711
So why don't you just crawl in there,
find the program error and delete it?

13:14.877 --> 13:17.346
Not quite ready to do that yet.

13:17.505 --> 13:20.679
Look, what's your day like tomorrow?

13:20.842 --> 13:22.765
Oh, no. No, no, no.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.897
I'm going on my first vacation
in six years.

13:26.055 --> 13:28.774
Just made my reservation and
confirmed it. There are no refunds.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.480
<i>What time is your flight?</i>

13:30.643 --> 13:35.319
Twelve. But I have to pack.
I'm gonna be a complete madwoman,

13:35.481 --> 13:37.161
so why don't you just
wait till I get back?

13:37.650 --> 13:38.993
I don't think so.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.574
Come on, why don't you just tell
me what this is about?

13:40.737 --> 13:42.239
<i>Look, I'd rather
not on the phone.</i>

13:42.947 --> 13:46.372
I can fly down tonight in my
Cessna, be there by breakfast.

13:46.534 --> 13:48.662
We'd have five hours. Angela,

13:48.828 --> 13:50.671
<i>you know this shit
better than anyone.</i>

13:53.624 --> 13:57.549
Fine. Fine, fine, fine.
I'll see you at 7.

13:57.712 --> 14:01.307
Great. Great. So they
finally get to meet.

14:01.466 --> 14:03.639
I'll be the, uh... The tall guy.

14:03.801 --> 14:07.897
I'm gonna be the one with "spineless
simp" tattooed to her forehead.

14:08.056 --> 14:09.182
Bye.
<i>Bye.</i>

14:09.349 --> 14:10.396
See you tomorrow.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.862
Why do I do this?

14:17.565 --> 14:21.911
Burbank tower,
Cessna 739 Mike Bravo.

14:22.070 --> 14:25.870
Intercepting approach course
ILS, runway eight.

14:27.825 --> 14:31.170
<i>Three-nine
Mike Bravo, we've lost radar contact.</i>

14:31.329 --> 14:33.206
<i>Say your position and altitude.</i>

14:33.373 --> 14:37.799
Just passing the middle
marker at 1300 feet.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.179
<i>Three-nine Mike Bravo,
that's a negative.</i>

14:40.338 --> 14:42.807
<i>Verify your position
and check your instruments.</i>

14:42.965 --> 14:46.219
All normal. You must
be able to see my lights.

14:46.386 --> 14:49.731
<i>That's a negative. Execute
a missed approach immediately.</i>

14:49.889 --> 14:52.438
<i>Contact approach control
on 124.5.</i>

14:52.600 --> 14:54.853
Okay, Burbank,
but still, everything looks ok...

14:56.229 --> 14:58.607
Shit! God!

15:46.612 --> 15:47.864
Cathedral Software.

15:48.030 --> 15:50.203
Hi. Russ Melbourne, please.
Yes, one moment, please.

15:51.659 --> 15:53.457
<i>Mozart's ghost!</i>

15:53.619 --> 15:55.417
Russ Melbourne here.
<i>Hi, it's Angela.</i>

15:55.580 --> 15:57.048
Angela. I thought
you'd be long gone.

15:57.206 --> 15:59.425
No, I was actually getting ready
to leave. That's why I'm calling.

15:59.584 --> 16:03.009
Good. I'm glad you're still going, but
when you get back, we need to talk.

16:03.171 --> 16:05.845
<i>We're really desperately short
of your genius up here.</i>

16:06.007 --> 16:08.430
Oh, please. I am far from
being a genius, Russ,

16:08.593 --> 16:10.687
especially with a room full
of people looking over my shoulder.

16:10.845 --> 16:12.563
We've talked about this before.
Listen, that's not the reason I called.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.144
Just think about it, will you?

16:14.307 --> 16:16.309
The honchos up here aren't going
to let me pick up someone new

16:16.476 --> 16:17.916
to replace Dale on such
short notice,

16:18.060 --> 16:21.564
<i>not with all the security
breaches we've had in the past.</i>

16:21.731 --> 16:23.483
Replace Dale?
Okay.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.276
What? You're kidding, right?

16:25.443 --> 16:28.538
<i>Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I thought you'd heard.</i>

16:28.696 --> 16:31.074
What? What happened?

16:31.240 --> 16:35.746
Angela, Dale's dead. His plane
crashed last night outside L.A.

16:35.912 --> 16:40.418
He... I just talked to him yesterday.
He was... He was coming to see me.

16:40.583 --> 16:43.587
Kind of puts things in
perspective, doesn't it?

16:43.753 --> 16:45.801
<i>Well, let's talk when
you get back, huh?</i>

16:45.963 --> 16:49.934
<i>And, heh, try to have
a good vacation.</i>

16:50.092 --> 16:53.221
Okay.
I'll talk to you soon, Russ.

17:15.952 --> 17:17.625
Plenty of time, sis.
Plenty of time.

17:17.787 --> 17:21.837
Ain't nothing coming in
or going out for the last hour.

17:22.708 --> 17:25.712
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.</i>

17:25.877 --> 17:28.802
<i>We are sorry to announce
there is a computer malfunction</i>

17:28.965 --> 17:30.638
<i>and all flights have been canceled...</i>

17:30.800 --> 17:32.302
The whole airport is down.

17:32.468 --> 17:35.187
<i>As soon as we get further
information, we will advise you.</i>

17:35.346 --> 17:36.563
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

17:46.857 --> 17:48.404
We will let you all know.
I am sorry...

17:48.568 --> 17:52.698
Excuse me. Excuse me.
We are doing the best we can.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.497
Yeah. Okay.

17:56.659 --> 17:58.659
<i>...political circles that a blood test</i>

17:58.661 --> 18:01.414
<i>taken last week at
Bethesda Naval Hospital</i>

18:01.581 --> 18:05.461
<i>did in fact reveal that Under Secretary
of Defense Mike Bergstrom</i>

18:05.626 --> 18:07.879
<i>was infected with
the AIDS virus.</i>

18:08.045 --> 18:10.264
<i>Bergstrom, well known for his...
You okay?</i>

18:10.423 --> 18:13.677
Oh, yeah. It's just, you know,
all these people. It's a little...

18:13.843 --> 18:17.268
No, I meant, are you okay with
your soda? Would you like a refill?

18:17.430 --> 18:19.023
No, I'm fine.
I've had three already.

18:19.181 --> 18:20.603
<i>The computer malfunction
has been repaired.</i>

18:20.766 --> 18:23.519
One more and I'll probably be
able to fly myself to Mexico.

18:23.686 --> 18:26.735
Looks like you won't have to.
Enjoy your flight.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.453
<i>Mozart's ghost!</i>
Waiter.

19:14.612 --> 19:17.161
I'd like a Gibson, please.

19:17.323 --> 19:20.918
It's a martini with an onion
instead of an olive.

19:21.077 --> 19:22.499
Is that okay?

19:23.537 --> 19:24.959
Thanks.

19:26.123 --> 19:28.296
Excuse me. Could I
have one too, please?

19:30.252 --> 19:32.095
I'll take mine up at the bar.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.760
Didn't think anybody else
drank those anymore.

19:37.927 --> 19:41.682
Well, I guess I'm not as unfashionable
as I once thought I was.

19:46.769 --> 19:49.147
Is that business or pleasure?

19:49.313 --> 19:51.736
Is there a difference?

19:51.899 --> 19:54.368
Not a great deal if you're a hacker.

19:58.197 --> 20:01.747
That's a nice piece of hardware.
I assume you're in the business?

20:01.909 --> 20:04.207
Isn't everybody?

20:04.370 --> 20:05.417
Nope.

20:08.958 --> 20:11.211
God, we're pathetic, aren't we?

20:14.046 --> 20:15.423
Excuse me?

20:17.299 --> 20:18.926
Well, we're here.

20:20.511 --> 20:23.890
We're sitting on the most
perfect beach in the world,

20:25.224 --> 20:26.704
and all we can think about
is where...

20:26.851 --> 20:29.479
Where can I hook up my modem?

20:29.645 --> 20:31.113
Yeah, exactly.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.079
Um...

20:39.238 --> 20:40.785
I'm Jack Devlin.

20:43.534 --> 20:44.660
Ange... Angela Bennett.

20:44.827 --> 20:46.670
Angela?
Mm-hm.

20:46.829 --> 20:47.876
Hi.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.797
Uh-oh.
Ha, ha.

20:55.963 --> 20:58.261
My most embarrassing secret.

20:59.467 --> 21:01.469
<i>You know Breakfast at Tiffany's?</i>

21:01.635 --> 21:04.388
Very well. it's... It's my favorite film.
Right.

21:04.555 --> 21:06.675
I pretty much wore out my
membership renting it, so...

21:06.682 --> 21:10.107
You know what I'm talking about, then.
Yes, very much so.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.863
When I was about 13,

21:13.022 --> 21:15.775
I had this sort of...

21:15.941 --> 21:17.488
identity crisis.

21:19.028 --> 21:21.907
I used to think
I was one of the characters.

21:22.072 --> 21:24.200
You thought you were
Audrey Hepburn?

21:24.366 --> 21:26.710
No, I used to think I was the cat.

21:26.869 --> 21:28.166
The cat?
Mm-hm.

21:28.329 --> 21:32.004
And I'd... I'd sit there, and I'd
Ha, ha.

21:32.166 --> 21:34.419
Play out the last
scene of the movie.

21:34.585 --> 21:37.088
I'd just play it over
and over again.

21:40.007 --> 21:42.055
You know the last scene?
Yes, I know the last scene.

21:42.218 --> 21:44.596
Out in the pouring rain,
out in the alleyway,

21:44.762 --> 21:47.515
and I'm soaked to the
bone and I'm scared.

21:49.350 --> 21:50.693
And I'm...

21:53.354 --> 21:54.697
abandoned.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.324
I'm alone.

22:01.487 --> 22:02.864
That's it.

22:21.298 --> 22:23.926
Would you have dinner
with me tonight?

22:25.719 --> 22:27.938
Come on.
It's your last night.

22:28.931 --> 22:30.478
You know what?

22:31.725 --> 22:34.820
I would...
I would actually really love to.

22:34.979 --> 22:36.105
Great.

22:38.566 --> 22:40.364
It's a company perk.

22:40.526 --> 22:42.528
God, this is a company perk?

22:42.695 --> 22:44.538
Yeah.
Some perk.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.950
I think I got a calendar
one year from Cathedral.

23:02.882 --> 23:06.386
Where are you from?
Colorado? Yes, it has to be.

23:06.552 --> 23:12.230
Um, eastern... Maybe it's the
southeastern part of the state.

23:12.391 --> 23:15.315
The teeming metropolis
of La Junta, population 50.

23:15.477 --> 23:18.856
La Junta?
Ha-ha-ha. That's pretty good.

23:19.023 --> 23:22.653
Is my accent that strong
after all these years?

23:22.818 --> 23:24.946
No, it's just a trick I do.
Oh.

23:26.989 --> 23:30.163
Why "after all these years"?
How long you been gone?

23:30.326 --> 23:33.500
Oh, boy.
It seems like a lifetime.

23:33.662 --> 23:35.756
Let's see. I was, uh...

23:35.915 --> 23:39.169
I was 15, going on 10,

23:39.335 --> 23:43.715
and we moved from La Junta
to San Jose,

23:44.006 --> 23:45.758
Tulsa, um...

23:45.925 --> 23:48.053
So your father got transferred a lot.

23:48.218 --> 23:51.438
No, not really. No. He, um...

23:51.597 --> 23:56.728
I don't know. You know, he
just transferred out one day.

24:02.816 --> 24:04.739
What?
What are you looking at?

24:06.570 --> 24:07.617
You.

24:09.198 --> 24:10.290
Me?

24:15.454 --> 24:18.128
Computers are your life,
aren't they?

24:18.290 --> 24:21.294
Yes. Perfect hiding place.

24:23.170 --> 24:24.467
Thanks.

24:26.715 --> 24:28.809
Oh, yeah. Yeah, okay.
Picture of you.

24:31.512 --> 24:33.856
No, I have one or two other
interests, I'll have you know.

24:34.014 --> 24:37.860
Oh, yes? Such as? What's your
specialty in computers?

24:38.018 --> 24:42.649
Oh, um, anything, pretty much. Beta
testing, mostly, but pretty much anything.

24:44.692 --> 24:46.194
That's way over my head,
I'm afraid.

24:46.360 --> 24:49.739
No, no. I just... You just go
into people's systems,

24:49.905 --> 24:52.249
you find their faults and
you fix it, that's all.

24:52.408 --> 24:54.581
What happens if they
don't have any faults?

24:54.743 --> 24:56.996
Don't believe I've met one yet.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.752
You must be a bit cold.

25:02.918 --> 25:06.968
Not really. Well, yeah.
A little bit. Heh.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.434
Here.

25:11.593 --> 25:13.766
What?
Well, it goes around here.

25:13.929 --> 25:15.931
What are you doing?
Ha-ha-ha.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.070
Better?

25:35.576 --> 25:39.376
Want one?
Oh, God, I used to smoke those.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.666
But you quit, right?
Mm-hm.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.216
Well, I refuse to.

25:48.047 --> 25:51.677
I reckon you gotta try a few things
in life without a safety net or

25:51.842 --> 25:53.844
how else
you gonna know you're alive?

25:54.011 --> 25:56.514
Well, I...
I take my share of risks.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.399
Uh-huh.
Um, I don't always floss.

25:59.558 --> 26:02.687
I rip the tags off my pillows
when they're new.

26:05.481 --> 26:07.700
My kind of woman.
Yeah, well...

26:09.902 --> 26:12.826
Pretty adventurous.
I don't know.

26:12.988 --> 26:15.741
I mean, what did you have in mind?

26:15.908 --> 26:17.535
Dare you risk it?

26:18.994 --> 26:21.497
Oh, shit! My purse!

26:21.663 --> 26:23.506
Fuck.
No, no! Don't!

26:23.665 --> 26:25.713
- It's not worth getting killed over!
- Come back!

26:25.876 --> 26:29.176
- You! Stop!
- Jack, don't! Come back here!

26:34.593 --> 26:36.812
It's not here.
It's not in hotel.

26:36.970 --> 26:38.017
I look everywhere.
Shit!

26:38.180 --> 26:39.700
So I come here, I do like you say.

26:39.848 --> 26:44.695
Whoosh, like magician.
Oh, yeah. You're the midget Houdini.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.288
Jack?

26:59.952 --> 27:01.329
Jack!

27:31.984 --> 27:33.624
God, I had
everything in that bag.

27:33.735 --> 27:36.204
I had my passport.
I had my credit cards. I had...

27:36.363 --> 27:38.411
- Ow!
- Sorry. Sorry.

27:38.991 --> 27:40.584
Thanks for doing this.

27:40.742 --> 27:43.120
Well, you're the one
bleeding to death.

27:43.287 --> 27:46.336
I am the one crying about
my MasterCard.

27:47.708 --> 27:50.131
I apologize for having been a jerk.

27:50.294 --> 27:52.046
What do you mean?

27:52.212 --> 27:53.634
I'm the jerk.

27:55.465 --> 27:57.342
Only trying to impress you.

27:59.052 --> 28:01.271
Well, for future reference,

28:01.430 --> 28:02.682
you should know that the living

28:02.848 --> 28:05.772
tend to interest me just
a little more than the dead do.

28:05.934 --> 28:07.732
Yeah?
Yeah.

28:07.895 --> 28:10.193
I suppose that's quite healthy.
Mm.

28:17.738 --> 28:20.958
Look, I suppose we ought to try
and call up the Cancún police

28:21.116 --> 28:22.413
on the ship-to-shore.

28:23.535 --> 28:24.661
Okay.

28:26.205 --> 28:29.209
It's not working.

28:29.374 --> 28:31.502
We'll have to head further out.

28:31.668 --> 28:35.844
Well, you can head out to Morocco for
all I care. It's beautiful out here.

28:52.147 --> 28:54.115
How we doing?

28:54.274 --> 28:55.742
Still no dice.

29:18.340 --> 29:19.933
I'm just going down below.

29:21.051 --> 29:22.268
I won't be a minute.

29:50.247 --> 29:52.591
Maybe we didn't go out far enough.

29:52.749 --> 29:54.592
No, this should do it.

30:01.591 --> 30:04.970
Tonight's been so out
of control, huh?

30:05.137 --> 30:06.184
Yeah.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.586
I hope you don't take
this the wrong way,

30:37.753 --> 30:40.006
but this isn't exactly my style.

30:42.174 --> 30:44.643
I thought you liked taking risks.

30:46.219 --> 30:48.096
Well,

30:48.263 --> 30:50.140
yes, but I mean...

30:50.307 --> 30:53.106
You know what I mean.
What?

30:53.268 --> 30:55.316
You know, first date.
Yeah.

30:55.479 --> 30:57.439
Sex. One-night stand. That sort of thing.
Oh, sex.

30:57.564 --> 30:59.942
Yes, that sort of thing.
Ha-ha-ha.

31:00.776 --> 31:02.949
You've always been
a relationship kind of girl.

31:03.111 --> 31:05.205
Absolutely.
Both times.

31:09.201 --> 31:11.295
So when was the last time?

31:11.453 --> 31:14.297
Um, 1933?

31:14.456 --> 31:15.708
Oh, I see.

31:18.251 --> 31:20.219
And who was he?
Your college boyfriend?

31:24.883 --> 31:26.760
Yeah, I bet he was the...

31:26.927 --> 31:29.555
He was the captain
of the drinking team.

31:31.556 --> 31:33.479
Wasn't ready for a relationship.

31:33.642 --> 31:36.771
Ah, wish I had been that lucky.

31:36.937 --> 31:39.861
No, it was, uh...
it was my shrink, actually.

31:41.858 --> 31:43.735
You know the story.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.404
I thought I was lonely

31:46.530 --> 31:47.702
and he forgot he was married.

31:49.908 --> 31:52.002
That's okay.
It didn't last very long.

31:54.121 --> 31:58.501
Then my mom developed Alzheimer's
around then, so it was really...

32:01.086 --> 32:03.464
You know what?
I'll shut up right now.

32:03.630 --> 32:05.849
I'm just gonna be quiet.

32:06.007 --> 32:07.179
That's okay.

32:07.342 --> 32:12.473
No, actually, I... It's me who
doesn't want to hear it. Ahem.

32:13.014 --> 32:15.187
Sorry, I'm just...
I'm rambling a little bit,

32:15.350 --> 32:17.853
I think because
I'm a little nervous.

32:23.066 --> 32:24.534
You want a drink?

32:24.693 --> 32:27.947
Well, yes. That'd be greatly
appreciated. Thank you.

33:14.493 --> 33:16.461
So, what's this for?

33:19.623 --> 33:22.877
It's, uh...
It's for shark fishing.

33:23.043 --> 33:26.388
Shark fishing?
With a silencer?

33:27.547 --> 33:28.673
Yeah.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.434
You certainly seem
to know your ordnance.

33:34.596 --> 33:36.940
Colorado.
You grow up with guns.

33:38.308 --> 33:39.730
Yeah.

33:41.102 --> 33:42.194
So...

33:43.480 --> 33:45.198
Who are you, Jack?
Heh.

33:46.733 --> 33:50.658
Who am I? Who am I?
I'll tell you who I am.

33:50.820 --> 33:55.246
I'm Captain goddamn America meets
Albert Schweitzer, that's who I am.

33:55.408 --> 33:57.786
Isn't that what you always wanted?

33:57.953 --> 34:01.207
It is. I remember.
It was, um... Butch,

34:01.373 --> 34:03.546
beautiful, brilliant.

34:03.708 --> 34:08.304
Spends all day dashing
into the fray, fists flying.

34:08.463 --> 34:12.342
No, sorry, I don't know any
organ cantatas. Was that it?

34:15.844 --> 34:18.393
Yeah, and if you'll excuse me,

34:18.556 --> 34:21.561
it's time to make
the world safe for democracy.

34:32.612 --> 34:35.161
Where's the clip?

34:35.322 --> 34:36.745
Give me that!

34:41.663 --> 34:42.835
Bitch.

34:47.085 --> 34:50.179
Okay. Help, somebody.
Somebody, I need help.

34:50.338 --> 34:53.638
Somebody? Hello, somebody?
Please, somebody, I need help.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.848
Somebody? Please?

34:56.011 --> 34:58.264
Okay. All right, um, keys.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.808
Keys. Okay, keys.

35:00.974 --> 35:02.442
Okay.

35:03.810 --> 35:04.936
Keys.

35:21.703 --> 35:23.455
Okay, um...

36:37.612 --> 36:38.829
Hello? Hello?

36:41.324 --> 36:43.668
Hello?
Shh, shh.

36:47.080 --> 36:50.209
What? No. How did...
How did I get here?

36:51.167 --> 36:52.965
How'd I get here?

36:53.128 --> 36:55.881
A fisherman found you.
He brought you here.

36:56.965 --> 36:59.138
You were very lucky they came by.

36:59.300 --> 37:00.472
How long have I been here?

37:00.635 --> 37:04.185
Three days.
Try not to talk too much, hm?

37:04.347 --> 37:08.853
Oh, we found a man's wallet filled
with pesos and a lot of U.S. dollars.

37:09.018 --> 37:11.646
We tried to contact him.
No. No. No, he...

37:11.813 --> 37:14.783
No, no, no. There was
no luck finding this man.

37:14.941 --> 37:17.820
There was a disk.

37:17.986 --> 37:21.411
A green square. A plastic disk.

37:21.573 --> 37:25.498
Ah, yes, yes.
The disk was ruined by the sun.

37:25.660 --> 37:26.707
Ha, ha.
Yeah.

37:26.870 --> 37:29.293
You relax now, hm?
Get well.

37:29.456 --> 37:30.696
No, I... I'm...
In a few days...

37:30.832 --> 37:32.675
I need...
Look at you now.

37:32.834 --> 37:36.464
No. I need my clothes.
You haven't got the strength. Please.

37:36.629 --> 37:37.972
How much do I owe you?

37:38.131 --> 37:40.054
Please. You have to relax now.
No.

37:40.216 --> 37:42.560
You have to rest. You need a few days.
I need my clothes.

37:42.719 --> 37:45.598
I have to go.
I just need my clothes.

37:55.398 --> 37:59.869
<i>In national news, we go
to WNN correspondent Daniel Schorr.</i>

38:00.028 --> 38:01.029
Hi, I need...

38:01.196 --> 38:03.449
<i>Wall Street panicked when
stock prices appeared to tumble</i>

38:03.615 --> 38:06.084
<i>at a rate reminiscent of
the Black Tuesday crash.</i>

38:06.242 --> 38:10.964
<i>Officials suspended trading when it became
clear that the losses were fictitious</i>

38:11.122 --> 38:13.763
<i>and caused by computer pranksters
when obscene messages appeared...</i>

38:13.875 --> 38:15.718
I need my room key
for 2806, please.

38:15.877 --> 38:17.675
What is the name?
Angela Bennett.

38:17.837 --> 38:19.430
<i>Wall Street expects
to open tomorrow</i>

38:19.589 --> 38:22.468
<i>with its computers protected
by Gregg Microsystems'</i>

38:22.634 --> 38:27.014
<i>latest security program,
aptly nicknamed the Gatekeeper.</i>

38:27.180 --> 38:28.781
<i>What about
that prank downtown?</i>

38:28.890 --> 38:32.690
<i>Pranks? Short-sheeting
someone's bed is a prank.</i>

38:32.852 --> 38:36.482
<i>These praetorians could have done
serious damage to our economy,</i>

38:36.648 --> 38:38.821
<i>just as the actions
recently at LAX.</i>

38:38.983 --> 38:42.157
No, I'm sorry. Angela Bennett
checked out last Saturday night.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.869
No. Sorry, you don't understand.
I'm Angela Bennett.

38:45.031 --> 38:46.874
I'm standing right here.
I didn't check out.

38:47.033 --> 38:48.910
No. I'm sorry,
it's not on the computer.

38:49.077 --> 38:51.205
Let me check one more thing.

38:51.371 --> 38:53.749
<i>On a lighter note,
a drug raid in Detroit...</i>

38:53.915 --> 38:57.294
No Angela Bennett. She checked
out last Saturday night.

38:57.460 --> 38:58.677
No.

38:58.837 --> 39:00.464
I didn't check out.
I would know if I checked out.

39:00.630 --> 39:01.847
I didn't check out.

39:02.006 --> 39:03.428
According to the computer,
you checked out.

39:03.591 --> 39:06.344
There's nothing
I can do for you, okay? I'm sorry.

39:06.511 --> 39:09.014
Excuse me, sir?
Step in, sir, please.

39:09.180 --> 39:12.024
That room is fine.
We'll take it.

39:12.183 --> 39:14.857
That's for you.
Okay. This one.

39:15.019 --> 39:16.896
Excuse me, ma'am.

39:19.190 --> 39:21.784
- There you go.
- Thank you.

39:21.943 --> 39:24.492
<i>Please dial
your card number again now.</i>

39:24.654 --> 39:27.498
<i>The card number you have
just dialed is not valid.</i>

39:29.701 --> 39:32.204
Miss Marx?

39:32.370 --> 39:34.873
<i>Please dial your card
number again now.</i>

39:35.039 --> 39:36.416
Ruth Marx?

39:36.583 --> 39:39.257
Excuse me, are you Ruth Marx?

39:39.419 --> 39:41.547
No.

39:41.713 --> 39:44.011
You're not the woman who's
here about a temporary visa?

39:44.173 --> 39:45.971
No, I am here about a visa, but...

39:46.134 --> 39:51.812
Is your social security
number 915-30-1717?

39:51.973 --> 39:56.274
You live at 407 Finley Avenue, Venice?

39:56.436 --> 39:58.029
Yeah.

39:58.187 --> 39:59.939
Well, then according
to the computers

40:00.106 --> 40:03.736
of the California Department of
Motor Vehicles, you're Ruth Marx.

40:05.278 --> 40:07.576
So, if that's who you are,

40:07.739 --> 40:10.538
you need to sign there
and we'll issue your visa.

40:10.700 --> 40:13.795
But I'm... I'm not, um...
You're not what?

40:16.539 --> 40:21.010
Um... I'm not, uh,
clear about something.

40:21.169 --> 40:25.515
Without this, I can't get back into
the United States, is that correct?

40:25.673 --> 40:28.267
That's correct.
So...

40:28.426 --> 40:31.726
all I would have to do is
just sign Ruth Marx and...

40:31.888 --> 40:33.356
Right. There.

41:31.114 --> 41:33.367
Okay, okay.
Think, think, think.

42:08.568 --> 42:09.945
Oh, my God.

42:12.947 --> 42:15.120
Oh, my God.

42:16.868 --> 42:17.915
Hey, where you running?

42:18.077 --> 42:20.250
Don't run.
Take your time. Relax.

42:20.413 --> 42:22.053
My name is Stan Whiteman,
Whiteman Realty.

42:22.123 --> 42:23.523
Come on in, let me show you around.

42:23.666 --> 42:25.134
You'll like it.

42:25.793 --> 42:27.887
Oh, I definitely
saw her move out.

42:28.046 --> 42:29.764
Okay, when was this?

42:29.922 --> 42:32.846
Three days ago.
Moving van, moving men, furniture.

42:33.009 --> 42:35.103
No, no. I've been in Mexico
for over a week now.

42:35.261 --> 42:37.309
How could I be in L.A. selling
my house at the same time?

42:37.472 --> 42:38.689
It wasn't your house to sell!

42:38.848 --> 42:40.600
It's not her! I'm telling you,
it's not Angela Bennett!

42:40.767 --> 42:42.769
Please, sir, calm down.
I am Angela Bennett!

42:42.935 --> 42:44.152
Please.
The real Angela Bennett

42:44.312 --> 42:46.235
had the deed and the
mortgage papers. Come on!

42:46.397 --> 42:49.617
I got 20,000 in the computers over here.
I checked every record. It's not her!

42:49.776 --> 42:52.279
Look, ma'am,
it would help everything

42:52.445 --> 42:54.743
if you could produce
some form of identification.

42:54.906 --> 42:56.499
You know what?
I agree with you,

42:56.657 --> 42:59.410
I agree with you. But as I have
told you 1,000 times already today,

42:59.577 --> 43:01.295
that I had everything
stolen in Cozumel.

43:01.454 --> 43:04.424
Please. Ask her how she got across
the border without a passport.

43:04.582 --> 43:07.461
- I had a temporary issued.
- Do they do that?

43:07.627 --> 43:08.753
I don't think they do that.

43:08.920 --> 43:12.015
Oh, my God. This is ridiculous.

43:12.173 --> 43:17.020
Here. Here it is. This is it. It's
just that it's under a different name.

43:17.178 --> 43:20.352
Why's that?
Because they think I'm not me.

43:20.515 --> 43:21.812
Is this your signature?

43:21.974 --> 43:23.442
Well, no. It's my handwriting,

43:23.601 --> 43:26.445
but I just signed the different
name that they gave me.

43:26.604 --> 43:28.652
It's a federal
offense to forge a visa.

43:28.815 --> 43:32.319
Oh, really? It is? And what is
it to steal an entire house?

43:32.485 --> 43:34.829
Yo, Mike. You wanna run this?
I'll be right back.

43:34.987 --> 43:36.947
You know what? It's not
gonna make any difference,

43:37.031 --> 43:40.661
because what they've done is they've screwed
with my information and fingerprints.

43:40.827 --> 43:41.874
<i>Who's they?</i>

43:42.036 --> 43:43.709
<i>I have no idea.</i>

43:43.871 --> 43:46.545
<i>Where do you work?
Do you work around here?</i>

43:47.375 --> 43:50.655
<i>Well, yeah, I work in my house,
but, I mean, my office is in San Francisco,</i>

43:50.795 --> 43:53.924
<i>but I've never been there.
But I work out of my house.</i>

43:54.090 --> 43:57.640
You don't know one person in a town
you've lived in for four years

43:57.802 --> 44:00.396
who can vouch you're Angela Bennett?
Not a mother, a father?

44:00.555 --> 44:04.981
<i>My mother is not well.
My father is... No. No. I...</i>

44:07.145 --> 44:11.525
<i>There's, uh... There's my
therapist Alan Champion.</i>

44:11.691 --> 44:13.113
<i>Your therapist?</i>

44:13.276 --> 44:15.074
<i>My ex-therapist, all right?</i>

44:26.581 --> 44:29.755
Yeah, we've got a Ruth
Marx trying to run a scam at a house.

44:29.917 --> 44:35.094
She's wanted for prostitution and
narcotics. We're gonna bring her in.

44:36.174 --> 44:39.018
Um, would you excuse me?

44:39.177 --> 44:42.351
I'm gonna be right back.
I'm, uh, just gonna use...

44:46.225 --> 44:48.102
Mrs. Raines,

44:49.312 --> 44:51.906
is she or isn't she?

44:52.064 --> 44:55.489
She kept to herself,
didn't talk to anybody.

44:55.651 --> 44:57.119
Where's the girl?
She's...

44:57.278 --> 44:59.872
Where's my phone?
Anybody seen my phone?

45:17.131 --> 45:20.135
Excuse me, sir. Did you see a
young woman running out of here?

45:20.301 --> 45:22.850
No, sir. I haven't seen anyone.
Thanks.

45:46.327 --> 45:47.670
Yeah?

45:47.828 --> 45:49.228
<i>What the hell
happened, Devlin?</i>

45:49.247 --> 45:51.007
<i>Don't worry.
We'll get hold of the disk</i>

45:51.040 --> 45:53.168
<i>and we'll find whoever
she's been speaking to.</i>

45:53.334 --> 45:56.463
<i>Don't forget, she's out here on her own.
She's feeling pretty vulnerable.</i>

45:56.629 --> 45:58.269
<i>We don't want another
Cozumel, Mr. Devlin.</i>

45:58.339 --> 46:00.683
<i>She's your responsibility.
Deal with it.</i>

46:00.841 --> 46:03.390
<i>Look, I said I 'd take
care of her, all right?</i>

46:13.896 --> 46:16.069
<i>Cathedral Software.</i>
Russ Melbourne.

46:16.232 --> 46:18.576
<i>Mr. Melbourne is no longer
with the company.</i>

46:18.734 --> 46:19.986
What do you mean?

46:20.152 --> 46:22.200
<i>May I connect you to
someone who could help?</i>

46:22.363 --> 46:26.038
I've never... I've never dealt with anybody
in Operations. I don't know anybody else.

46:26.200 --> 46:29.500
<i>Who may I connect you with?</i>
Um...

46:29.662 --> 46:32.541
Head of Security Systems. Look, just
tell them that it's Angela Bennett.

46:32.707 --> 46:34.801
<i>Thank you. I'll put you
through to Miss Bennett.</i>

46:34.959 --> 46:36.211
What? No.

46:36.377 --> 46:38.596
I am Angela Bennett.

46:39.630 --> 46:40.722
Hello?

46:40.881 --> 46:42.474
Hello, this is Angela Bennett.

46:49.307 --> 46:50.559
Who is this?

46:50.725 --> 46:52.318
<i>This is Angela Bennett. Hello?</i>

46:58.232 --> 47:01.486
<i>This is someone that can help you.
Give us the disk, Angela.</i>

47:01.652 --> 47:04.872
You have the wrong person.
I don't know what you're talking about.

47:05.031 --> 47:06.248
Angela. We're not offering
an option here.

47:06.407 --> 47:08.375
Just give us the disk, and
we'll give you your life back.

47:08.534 --> 47:09.786
I don't understand.

47:09.952 --> 47:12.956
I don't have your disk.
I don't know what you mean.

47:13.122 --> 47:15.625
<i>Give us the disk, Angela.</i>

47:18.294 --> 47:19.511
What is it?

47:27.303 --> 47:29.931
- What's the number?
555-7605.

47:30.097 --> 47:31.269
Did you get the address?

47:31.432 --> 47:33.230
<i>It's 3100 California.</i>

47:42.318 --> 47:45.071
<i>Hi, this is Dr. Alan
Champion. I can't come to the phone now</i>

47:45.237 --> 47:47.660
Oh, please be home.
<i>So at the beep, please leave your name,</i>

47:47.823 --> 47:49.503
<i>your number, la dee da.
You know the drill.</i>

47:51.994 --> 47:55.168
- Are you screening? Please be screening.
<i>- Hello. Hello. I'm home.</i>

47:55.331 --> 47:56.753
Hi. It's me.

47:59.377 --> 48:01.379
I need your help.
I'm in a lot of trouble.

48:03.297 --> 48:05.015
Shit.

48:05.174 --> 48:06.517
<i>I'm not exactly sure
what else you want me to do.</i>

48:06.675 --> 48:09.895
Look, hold on, hold on.
This is a cell phone, right?

48:10.054 --> 48:12.094
<i>Yeah. So, I mean, we can't put
a normal trace on it.</i>

48:12.139 --> 48:14.813
No, listen.
There's no problem. No, no, no.

48:14.975 --> 48:17.103
Just get the number.
<i>Right.</i>

48:17.269 --> 48:19.818
But don't dial it.
Just send out a signal.

48:19.980 --> 48:21.323
<i>Send it from the base here?</i>
Yeah.

48:21.482 --> 48:24.986
Then find me two repeater
cells that can pick it up.

48:25.152 --> 48:28.622
Give me the bisect and it'll find
it within a few hundred yards.

48:28.781 --> 48:29.953
<i>Okay.</i>
Go.

48:54.056 --> 48:55.979
Alan? Angie?

49:00.813 --> 49:02.815
Go, go, go.
Nice to see you too.

49:02.982 --> 49:04.029
I'm sorry. Just go.

49:04.191 --> 49:06.239
Well, come on, I'm not a cab.
Say hi.

49:06.402 --> 49:10.202
Hi. Can we go now?
Yeah. Now we can go.

49:10.781 --> 49:13.204
Listen, you still have that
laptop that I gave you?

49:13.367 --> 49:14.539
Uh-huh. I'm wearing it.

49:14.702 --> 49:16.704
I'm serious. Do you have it?
Yes, I have it.

49:16.871 --> 49:19.795
Okay, we need to go get it, and then I
need for you to take me to a hotel room.

49:19.957 --> 49:22.881
Now, that, that's doable.
Alan, just go.

49:23.043 --> 49:25.637
Just go. Go, go, go.

49:25.796 --> 49:28.970
I swear to God. I asked for a
quarter, she gave me a telephone.

49:29.133 --> 49:31.807
Yeah, that's right.
I'm calling everybody.

49:31.969 --> 49:33.312
Clever girl.

49:35.431 --> 49:38.685
Voila'. Ouch. Ha, ha.

49:38.851 --> 49:41.570
Alan, you don't have to...

49:41.729 --> 49:44.357
To stay if you don't want to.

49:44.523 --> 49:46.776
I'm sure that, um...
God, what's her name? Sorry.

49:46.942 --> 49:51.038
Amy. Don't worry.
It's over with Amy.

49:53.282 --> 49:54.329
I'm sorry.

49:54.492 --> 49:56.586
Ha, ha.
Don't be, dearie.

49:56.744 --> 49:59.247
We're not. This is...
This is bizarre.

49:59.413 --> 50:01.916
I haven't seen you in so long.
What are we even doing here?

50:02.082 --> 50:04.301
Um, I just figured
you would be safe.

50:04.460 --> 50:05.837
Oh, great.

50:06.003 --> 50:08.426
So I've gone from being
a self-centered asshole to safe.

50:08.589 --> 50:11.263
Thank you very much.

50:11.425 --> 50:14.804
No, I just figured that they
couldn't trace me to you

50:14.970 --> 50:18.395
and that your... Your patient
records are confidential, right?

50:18.557 --> 50:20.434
My patient records.

50:20.601 --> 50:22.695
Yeah, I knew I had
my subtle charms.

50:22.853 --> 50:25.697
It's just, you're the only person
I have to turn to right now, so...

50:25.856 --> 50:27.153
And you know what, Angie?

50:27.316 --> 50:30.695
I am gonna take that
as a big, big compliment.

50:30.861 --> 50:33.956
Guess what time it is.
Gibsons.

50:34.114 --> 50:36.492
Almost. We have no onions,
so we'll have to use these.

50:36.659 --> 50:40.539
Seldane, the antihistamine
of champions.

50:40.704 --> 50:43.378
Heh. I could always
make you laugh, couldn't I?

50:43.541 --> 50:46.169
You know what? I'm gonna pass.
No drink?

50:46.335 --> 50:48.713
No drink.
Hmm.

50:48.879 --> 50:50.597
All right.
I come bearing gifts.

50:50.756 --> 50:53.805
Some of Amy's clothes for
you here. Try these on.

51:02.059 --> 51:04.938
This is such a nightmare.
It's like I'm not even me anymore.

51:05.187 --> 51:07.064
Hey, hey, hey. Come here.

51:07.231 --> 51:09.984
Come on. Look at me.
You're freaking me.

51:10.150 --> 51:13.324
You gotta take a breath,
take a pause.

51:13.487 --> 51:17.492
Okay, if you're not you,
tell me who you think you are.

51:17.658 --> 51:20.018
Christ, you're not even listening to me.
Oh, I am listening.

51:20.077 --> 51:22.079
But come on,
somebody stole your purse.

51:22.246 --> 51:25.170
I didn't expect you to believe me.
Oh, come on. I do believe...

51:25.332 --> 51:28.006
Yeah, that's not true.
You know what I believe?

51:28.168 --> 51:29.886
I believe you're
a very frightened woman.

51:30.045 --> 51:32.405
I think in general, you're
disconnected from the human race.

51:32.423 --> 51:34.676
I think you're way out
there on your own.

51:34.842 --> 51:37.345
You mix in your father leaving...
Oh, no. No.

51:37.511 --> 51:40.936
My father has nothing to do with
the fact that my car's missing,

51:41.098 --> 51:43.692
has nothing to do with the fact
that my house is empty,

51:43.851 --> 51:46.900
that the Los Angeles Police
Department is chasing after me

51:47.062 --> 51:48.655
and that somebody out there
wants to kill me. No.

51:48.814 --> 51:52.034
Now, I believe something happened,
but that just doesn't make sense.

51:52.192 --> 51:55.287
Oh.
I don't want to be simplistic here, but

51:55.446 --> 51:58.040
I think you're just reaching out.

51:58.198 --> 52:00.701
You know what? You're absolutely
right. I am reaching out.

52:00.868 --> 52:02.469
I'm reaching out to
anybody who knows me,

52:02.620 --> 52:05.214
anybody who will listen
to me and believe me,

52:05.372 --> 52:07.500
be my friend and somebody to trust...
Hey, hey, hey.

52:07.666 --> 52:10.545
Hey, Angie.
I'm sorry.

52:10.711 --> 52:14.466
Sometimes it's easier for me to
play doctor than it is to listen.

52:14.632 --> 52:16.976
I just don't... I don't understand.
Why me? Why me?

52:17.134 --> 52:20.684
I am nobody. I am nothing.
But they knew everything about me.

52:20.846 --> 52:23.726
They knew what I ate, what I drank.
They knew what movies that I watched.

52:23.849 --> 52:25.977
They knew what...
Where I was from.

52:26.143 --> 52:28.191
They knew what cigarettes
I used to smoke.

52:28.354 --> 52:32.325
And everything they did, they must have
watched on the Internet. I don't know.

52:32.483 --> 52:35.157
Watched my credit cards?
Our whole lives are on the computer,

52:35.319 --> 52:37.162
and they knew that I
could be vanished.

52:37.321 --> 52:39.361
They knew that nobody
would care It's gonna be okay.

52:39.406 --> 52:40.407
And it wouldn't matter.
It's gonna be okay.

52:40.574 --> 52:44.249
It's going to be okay.
What can I do?

52:44.411 --> 52:47.415
I need for you to take my morn
and just put her anywhere.

52:47.581 --> 52:49.254
I don't care where, just put her
under a different name,

52:49.416 --> 52:50.838
because I don't know what
these people are gonna do.

52:51.001 --> 52:52.844
You can do that because you're a doctor?
Yeah, sure.

52:53.003 --> 52:54.723
I can put your mom
in the county sanitarium,

52:54.838 --> 52:58.217
say I want her there for
observation. How's that?

52:58.384 --> 53:02.059
That would mean a lot to me, because
she's all I got left right now.

53:02.221 --> 53:04.144
All that you have left?

53:04.306 --> 53:08.903
Christ, Angie, they've really
gotten into your head with this.

53:09.061 --> 53:12.361
Well, come on, put yourself in my shoes.
I don't hear from you for a long time.

53:12.523 --> 53:16.323
I get a phone call,
this convoluted story. Come on.

53:16.485 --> 53:19.489
I'm not buying the whole package,
but I'll tell you what I can do.

53:19.655 --> 53:22.033
I have a friend downtown in the federal
building. His name's Ben Phillips.

53:22.199 --> 53:24.452
He's an FBI agent. Why don't I...
No, no, no!

53:24.618 --> 53:27.667
I've been running from the police ever
since I got back in this country.

53:27.830 --> 53:31.334
That's the last thing I need.
Well, that's great, Angela.

53:31.500 --> 53:34.720
Why don't you just live the rest of your
life in this hotel room, how's that?

53:36.714 --> 53:38.432
Well, do you trust him?

53:38.590 --> 53:41.264
Yeah. I used to hold his head
over the toilet at frat parties.

53:41.427 --> 53:43.600
Come on. I'm serious.
Do you trust him?

53:43.762 --> 53:45.890
Yeah, I trust Ben. I do.

53:46.056 --> 53:47.603
Okay.

53:47.766 --> 53:49.894
Now let's formulate our plan.
I'm gonna go back to my place.

53:50.060 --> 53:53.189
I'll figure out the best way to
transfer your mom to the sanitarium.

53:53.355 --> 53:56.734
Then I'll call Ben. If I get any
information, I'll get back to you.

53:56.900 --> 53:58.026
Okay.

53:58.193 --> 54:00.161
Well, don't be so down.
Come here.

54:00.320 --> 54:03.324
It's gonna be okay.
I'm on watch now.

54:03.490 --> 54:07.211
You know, this would've never
happened if you had stayed with me.

54:09.997 --> 54:11.624
Hey, Alan?

54:11.790 --> 54:14.213
Thank you for everything.

54:16.253 --> 54:19.006
You're welcome.
You stay put, kiddo.

54:19.173 --> 54:20.220
Okay.

55:16.563 --> 55:19.863
Mm, <i>merci.</i>
Now prompt me, please.

55:20.025 --> 55:23.950
Okay. You carried this around,
Devlin, because it was important.

55:33.497 --> 55:35.465
Bethesda Naval Hospital.

55:36.583 --> 55:37.835
Password.

55:39.044 --> 55:42.423
Okay, password.
We're gonna try you.

55:46.301 --> 55:50.397
No. okay. Well, you look familiar.
Let's try you again.

55:52.808 --> 55:53.855
No, come on.

55:54.852 --> 55:58.072
Okay. Five-three-four... Now.

56:00.566 --> 56:01.692
Okay.

56:06.196 --> 56:07.914
Bergstrom?
What?

56:14.538 --> 56:15.881
Oh, my God.

56:32.431 --> 56:35.059
<i>- Yeah.
- Someone's on.</i>

56:35.225 --> 56:36.568
Think it's our girl?

56:36.727 --> 56:38.695
<i>Whoever it is, is covering
their tracks big time.</i>

56:38.854 --> 56:43.280
<i>A dozen hops so far. A pop in Switzerland,
a UNIX box in the University of Montana,</i>

56:43.442 --> 56:44.989
<i>five different routers
at Berkeley.</i>

56:45.152 --> 56:46.620
<i>They know what
they're doing.</i>

56:46.778 --> 56:48.576
How long will it take to track her?

56:48.739 --> 56:51.037
<i>Depending how much she's set
up, how long she stays on,</i>

56:51.199 --> 56:53.668
<i>15 minutes, half hour at the most.</i>

56:53.827 --> 56:55.921
Well, you call me the
second you find her.

56:56.079 --> 56:58.832
<i>And that other matter, Mr. Devlin?</i>

56:58.999 --> 57:02.094
<i>Oh, that's, um...
That's free of charge.</i>

57:18.477 --> 57:19.524
Thanks.

57:37.037 --> 57:38.084
No.

57:53.261 --> 57:54.729
Well...

58:00.978 --> 58:02.230
Yes.

58:32.718 --> 58:34.095
Praetorians?

58:34.261 --> 58:36.104
Praetorians, praetorians.

58:36.263 --> 58:38.516
What?
I need more information.

58:40.892 --> 58:43.270
“Big bad wolf, cyber terrorists."

58:46.356 --> 58:48.324
I need more information.

58:49.609 --> 58:52.829
“LAX, Wall Street, Atlanta.
Extremely dangerous.

58:52.988 --> 58:54.535
Don't mess with them."

58:54.698 --> 58:57.326
They've already started
messing with me.

58:58.910 --> 59:01.254
“Meet in IRL. In private."

59:02.539 --> 59:04.041
In real life.

59:05.375 --> 59:08.094
No, no, no.
It's gotta be a public place.

59:09.171 --> 59:11.344
Where it's safe,

59:11.506 --> 59:13.053
with a lot of people.

59:16.053 --> 59:18.476
Like Santa Monica pier.

59:18.638 --> 59:20.640
By... Where?

59:20.807 --> 59:22.354
The Ferris Wheel.

59:35.572 --> 59:37.666
- Any luck?
<i>- 8833 Rosewood</i>

59:37.824 --> 59:39.326
<i>in West Hollywood.</i>

59:39.493 --> 59:42.337
Remind me to buy you
guys something nice.

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:34.302
Hello.

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:37.802
Hello?

01:00:43.014 --> 01:00:44.015
Angie.

01:00:45.684 --> 01:00:48.233
Angie, come on. Let me in.
I'm dying out here with this food.

01:00:48.395 --> 01:00:49.567
Sorry.

01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:52.865
Sorry. I thought... You know.

01:00:53.024 --> 01:00:55.652
Forget it. Hi.

01:00:55.819 --> 01:00:59.119
I figured you'd be hungry,
so I stopped on the way over.

01:00:59.281 --> 01:01:02.706
I got you your favorite, Chinese.

01:01:02.868 --> 01:01:05.838
Um, it's your favorite. I never
really cared for it, remember?

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:08.749
That's immaterial. I knew
it was somebody's favorite.

01:01:08.915 --> 01:01:10.633
How's my mom?
Mom is fine.

01:01:10.792 --> 01:01:13.841
She's safely ensconced at the county
sanitarium. Everything's good.

01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:15.347
Great. Thank you.

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:18.805
Hey, listen, about the Chinese,
let me make it up to you.

01:01:18.967 --> 01:01:21.407
Why don't we go over to that
Greek restaurant we used to like?

01:01:21.553 --> 01:01:22.554
I can't. I gotta go.

01:01:22.721 --> 01:01:24.348
Really?

01:01:24.514 --> 01:01:27.235
Why do you have to go? Every time I
see you now, you're running away.

01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:30.609
No, I'm not. There's just a guy
from the Internet who might

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:32.613
know something
about what's going on.

01:01:32.772 --> 01:01:36.572
Well, can I at least tell you about Ben
Phillips, the guy you wanted me to talk to?

01:01:36.735 --> 01:01:42.162
I told him your story, and he said he wants
to see you first thing in the morning.

01:01:42.324 --> 01:01:44.644
Angie, can't you wait until...
Well, does he know about LAX

01:01:44.659 --> 01:01:46.419
and Wall Street and
what happened in Atlanta?

01:01:46.578 --> 01:01:49.127
Of course he knows what happened in
Atlanta. What did happen in Atlanta?

01:01:49.289 --> 01:01:51.130
A couple of kids black-out
part of a power grid

01:01:51.249 --> 01:01:52.250
and spell "Braves suck"
from the air.

01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:54.090
Is that a national emergency?

01:01:54.252 --> 01:01:56.846
Christ, Alan, listen. Cyberbob figured
it out, and he knows what he's doing.

01:01:57.005 --> 01:01:59.303
Okay? If I don't talk to him now,
it's gonna be too late.

01:01:59.466 --> 01:02:00.934
Listen to you!
Cyberbob!

01:02:01.092 --> 01:02:03.720
You're going to meet a
guy named Cyberbob!

01:02:03.887 --> 01:02:05.764
Have you ever even seen him?

01:02:05.931 --> 01:02:07.228
I don't want you going alone.

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:09.233
- Why don't you come with me?
- Sure I will.

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:10.735
Now, where are we
supposed to meet him?

01:02:10.894 --> 01:02:12.237
Santa Monica pier.

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:31.881
Yeah?
Hi. Bob Fox?

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:34.761
These people are dangerous. They
killed Dale because of what he knew.

01:02:34.918 --> 01:02:36.386
Now they think
I have this program.

01:02:36.544 --> 01:02:38.842
Angie, I'm with you on this.
Really, I am.

01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:41.349
But first, somebody tries to
kill you, now this guy Dale...

01:02:41.508 --> 01:02:44.728
And they put somebody in my place at
Cathedral to get rid of any traces there.

01:02:44.886 --> 01:02:47.480
Well, what I'm asking you is why would
anybody want to do any of this?

01:02:47.639 --> 01:02:50.679
Okay, they would want somebody in
Cathedral's mainframe in order to set traps

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:55.318
and to overwrite any programs, just to make
sure that this doesn't happen again, right?

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:57.198
Well, that would take weeks,

01:02:57.357 --> 01:02:59.280
and you cannot do that
from the outside.

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:00.568
Do you remember
that Internet number

01:03:00.735 --> 01:03:02.783
that I told you
that Devlin guy had?

01:03:02.946 --> 01:03:04.323
Well, I plugged it in,
and next thing I know,

01:03:04.489 --> 01:03:06.036
I'm staring at, like,
the personal medical files

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:08.543
of the Under Secretary of
Defense, Michael Bergstrom.

01:03:08.702 --> 01:03:10.295
The guy who blew his head off.
Yeah.

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:14.333
And they said that a computer blood
test told him he had AIDS, right?

01:03:14.499 --> 01:03:17.969
Well, when they did the autopsy,
there was no HIV found.

01:03:19.296 --> 01:03:20.593
Well, who knows? Maybe
when they do my autopsy,

01:03:20.755 --> 01:03:22.757
I can finally prove
that I'm not Ruth Marx.

01:03:22.924 --> 01:03:23.550
You know,

01:03:23.576 --> 01:03:26.078
what's frightening me is I'm starting
to think that you're not delusional.

01:03:26.219 --> 01:03:28.972
You know what I need to do,
I need to get back to Cathedral,

01:03:29.139 --> 01:03:31.979
I need to get on that Mozart's Ghost
program because that's gotta be it.

01:03:32.142 --> 01:03:34.982
That has to be it. They've got this
echo system on their computers there

01:03:35.061 --> 01:03:37.314
where you can retrace all your
keystrokes in case you made a mistake.

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:41.075
You... Are you all right?
Alan, what's the matter?

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:42.865
Pull over. Alan.

01:03:44.779 --> 01:03:46.747
- You're scaring me! Come on!
- Pills.

01:03:46.906 --> 01:03:48.203
- Talk to me. What?
- The pills.

01:03:48.366 --> 01:03:49.743
What pills? What?
What are you talking about?

01:03:49.909 --> 01:03:52.332
You know what, get over here.
We'll go to the hospital.

01:03:53.747 --> 01:03:55.966
He'll be okay, isn't he?

01:03:57.834 --> 01:03:59.336
Well, he's allergic to penicillin.

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:02.472
They have him intubated and
pumped full of epinephrine.

01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:06.385
I have no idea what you just said.
Look, he's going to be fine.

01:04:06.551 --> 01:04:09.350
If you like, you can go see him now.
Um...

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:11.890
Yeah, I would like that.
Thank you.

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:23.739
Hi.

01:04:25.195 --> 01:04:26.868
How do you feel?

01:04:28.823 --> 01:04:31.042
I'm starving.

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:32.248
Yeah?

01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:38.041
Well, the minute you get out,
I'll cook you

01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:40.427
the best microwave meal
you've ever had.

01:04:41.795 --> 01:04:43.672
How long are they gonna
keep me here?

01:04:43.838 --> 01:04:46.432
Um, I think just another day.

01:04:47.884 --> 01:04:51.934
And will you be handling
the outpatient care, nurse?

01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:54.478
Well, do you mind?

01:04:54.641 --> 01:04:56.063
Mm-mm.

01:04:56.226 --> 01:05:01.608
Visions of sponge baths
dance in my head.

01:05:11.116 --> 01:05:12.538
I gotta go.

01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:17.623
You gonna be okay?

01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:21.510
Yeah, I'll be fine.
I'm more worried about you.

01:05:23.253 --> 01:05:24.755
I'll be fine.

01:05:26.673 --> 01:05:29.722
Wish it was over, but I'll be fine.

01:05:29.884 --> 01:05:31.227
I know.

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:37.184
Come here.
I wanna tell you something.

01:05:38.226 --> 01:05:39.603
Come closer.

01:05:52.115 --> 01:05:54.789
I've wanted to do that
since yesterday.

01:05:57.245 --> 01:05:59.589
Yeah, well,

01:05:59.747 --> 01:06:01.966
when you get better,
I might let you do it again.

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:03.422
Mm.

01:06:06.629 --> 01:06:08.472
Do you still think I'm crazy?

01:06:08.631 --> 01:06:09.974
Sure I do.

01:06:11.926 --> 01:06:13.974
Always have.

01:06:40.705 --> 01:06:42.924
Get your cotton
candy here! 50 cents!

01:06:43.082 --> 01:06:44.629
Cotton candy!

01:06:45.627 --> 01:06:48.676
Great picture! Bye!

01:06:50.048 --> 01:06:53.097
Hey! How you doing?
Howdy!

01:06:53.259 --> 01:06:55.978
Everybody's a winner!
Everybody's a winner! Step right up!

01:06:56.137 --> 01:06:57.377
Hey, honey, wanna dance?

01:06:58.681 --> 01:06:59.841
Come on,
give Benny a big hug!

01:06:59.933 --> 01:07:01.185
Just get...

01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:05.356
Come on back here!
I'm a great dancer! Look at my feet!

01:07:05.522 --> 01:07:07.991
Knock the milk bottles down!

01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:23.600
Look out! Aah.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.613
Safer to stay right here.

01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:34.236
Sorry, Bob couldn't make it.

01:08:34.402 --> 01:08:36.529
Hey. Hey.

01:08:36.696 --> 01:08:39.165
Hey, I hope this isn't how you
greet all your old lovers.

01:08:39.323 --> 01:08:40.951
That's not exactly the category
that you fit into.

01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:42.118
No?

01:08:42.285 --> 01:08:45.585
I'm surprised you didn't
kill me, then fuck me.

01:08:45.747 --> 01:08:47.875
Listen. It was difficult, right?

01:08:48.041 --> 01:08:50.089
Because I was attracted
to you. I still am.

01:08:50.251 --> 01:08:51.719
I'm genuinely attracted to you.

01:08:51.877 --> 01:08:54.221
Yeah, well, I'm gonna genuinely attract
half the Santa Monica Police Department

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:55.973
if you don't let go of me now.

01:08:56.131 --> 01:09:00.854
Yeah? I know you've been avoiding
them since you ran out of that house.

01:09:02.513 --> 01:09:05.062
Well, I'm sure they'd
still be very interested

01:09:05.224 --> 01:09:07.773
in hearing how you crashed Dale Hessman's
plane, how you tried to kill me.

01:09:07.935 --> 01:09:09.733
I'm sure they'd love
to hear about that.

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:14.117
You go ahead. You feel free. I'm sure
they'd be happy to make your acquaintance.

01:09:15.068 --> 01:09:18.993
Did you know that Ruth Marx
has a criminal record?

01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:22.408
For drugs, prostitution.

01:09:23.618 --> 01:09:25.086
You've got quite a record.

01:09:25.243 --> 01:09:28.999
Yeah, almost as good a record
as Bergstrom has, huh?

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:31.417
What do you mean?
I know about Bergstrom's suicide.

01:09:31.584 --> 01:09:33.506
And I know all about
the praetorians too,

01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:36.765
so I'm sure they'd
love to hear about that.

01:09:36.923 --> 01:09:40.769
- One, two, three, four!
- Everybody has their button,

01:09:40.926 --> 01:09:43.930
and Bergstrom's just happened
to be homophobia.

01:09:45.305 --> 01:09:48.185
You just have to know people
well enough to know which...

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:51.188
Which button to push.

01:09:53.272 --> 01:09:56.116
I don't have your disk. If I had it, I
would give it to you. I don't have it.

01:09:56.275 --> 01:09:58.198
Okay.
It was ruined in Mexico.

01:09:58.361 --> 01:09:59.658
It's okay.

01:10:01.322 --> 01:10:05.372
But what we need now is what's
up here, so you come with me.

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:09.797
I promise you, I promise you
I'll look after you. Come on.

01:10:09.956 --> 01:10:11.958
See you later.
Hi! Excuse me!

01:10:14.585 --> 01:10:17.304
I don't understand.
What do you want?

01:10:17.463 --> 01:10:18.743
It's not about what I want.

01:10:19.632 --> 01:10:24.479
It's about what my employers want.
So take a look around you.

01:10:25.012 --> 01:10:26.480
Do you think things are working?

01:10:26.639 --> 01:10:27.811
I don't think so.

01:10:27.974 --> 01:10:29.100
They believe they can
make things better.

01:10:29.267 --> 01:10:30.644
What? By killing people?

01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:33.484
I don't ask too many questions
and I suggest you do the same.

01:10:33.646 --> 01:10:35.774
Come on!
Let's dance! Hey!

01:10:40.236 --> 01:10:42.580
Hey! Hey!
What are you... Don't push!

01:10:42.739 --> 01:10:44.707
Hey, you jerk! Jeez!

01:13:12.555 --> 01:13:14.899
<i>Dr. Henry to I.C.U.</i>

01:13:15.892 --> 01:13:17.565
<i>Dr. Henry to I.C.U.</i>

01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:21.735
<i>Dr. Herb Fields, staff to
ambulance bay.</i>

01:13:33.451 --> 01:13:37.422
<i>Code blue, 151 west.
Code blue, 151 west.</i>

01:13:43.628 --> 01:13:45.676
Let's go ahead
and defibrillate!

01:13:45.838 --> 01:13:46.839
Everybody clear?

01:13:48.215 --> 01:13:50.684
Three hundred. Let's go.
Let's go, everybody. Clear!

01:13:50.843 --> 01:13:53.266
Okay, he's got no pulse. He's not
responding. Get her out of here!

01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:56.603
No! No. He's my friend.
He's my friend. He's my friend.

01:13:56.766 --> 01:13:59.861
- Please help me!
- No! No! Let me go!

01:14:00.019 --> 01:14:01.362
Let's go!

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.880
- Go ahead and hit him again! Clear!
- No! No! Let go of me!

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:06.443
Alan, no.
Get off of me!

01:14:12.323 --> 01:14:14.166
Look, Mrs. Champion, I'm sorry.

01:14:14.325 --> 01:14:16.285
We did everything we could.
I'm not Mrs. Champion.

01:14:16.369 --> 01:14:18.292
There were complications.

01:14:19.413 --> 01:14:21.006
Would you like me to
call you a cab?

01:14:21.165 --> 01:14:25.170
Look, you're very upset. Is there
someone who can pick you up?

01:14:25.336 --> 01:14:27.009
Ma'am.

01:14:27.171 --> 01:14:30.721
Ma'am, would you like to talk
with a counselor?

01:14:30.883 --> 01:14:33.557
Ma'am, maybe you should just
lie down for a while.

01:14:33.719 --> 01:14:35.679
I don't understand. You said he
was gonna be fine.

01:14:35.721 --> 01:14:36.893
He was fine.

01:14:37.056 --> 01:14:40.230
I know I did. I'm sorry. We think the
insulin caused his blood pressure...

01:14:40.393 --> 01:14:42.896
No, no, it was penicillin.
He was on penicillin.

01:14:43.062 --> 01:14:46.407
No, Dr. Champion was being held
for the treatment of diabetes.

01:14:46.565 --> 01:14:48.863
- No. No. No.
- He went into insulin shock.

01:14:49.026 --> 01:14:52.747
No. He was not a diabetic.
I'm afraid he was. I can pull up his files.

01:14:52.905 --> 01:14:55.078
No, he wasn't diabetic!

01:15:14.552 --> 01:15:16.512
I don't know how much
longer it's gonna be.

01:15:16.595 --> 01:15:18.017
Yeah.

01:15:20.141 --> 01:15:23.441
All right, watch your step here.

01:15:23.602 --> 01:15:25.229
Aw, man, I didn't do it!

01:15:25.396 --> 01:15:27.865
Take it easy.
We're just...

01:16:47.561 --> 01:16:49.188
Hello.

01:16:49.355 --> 01:16:53.485
You've no idea what it does to me
just hearing the sound of your voice.

01:16:53.651 --> 01:16:56.029
<i>No, don't hang up, Angela.
Please.</i>

01:16:56.195 --> 01:16:57.538
<i>This is important.</i>

01:16:57.696 --> 01:17:01.951
If you would just take a step
back from all of this, you'd...

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:06.168
You'd see that you and I,
we're really not so very different.

01:17:06.330 --> 01:17:09.834
<i>We're both loners.
We're both isolated.</i>

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.549
<i>We're both really untrusting.</i>

01:17:13.003 --> 01:17:17.099
We're both looking for
the same clarity.

01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:20.344
<i>You've come to mean
a great deal to me.</i>

01:17:20.511 --> 01:17:22.434
Yeah, well, you mean shit to me.

01:17:22.596 --> 01:17:28.103
Look, I have to admit an arrogance
in my perceptions of you.

01:17:28.394 --> 01:17:30.613
<i>You see, I've come to visit
a friend of mine,</i>

01:17:32.106 --> 01:17:34.484
an old piano teacher friend of mine.

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:36.448
You leave my mother alone.

01:17:36.610 --> 01:17:39.079
<i>Well, it seems I have no choice.</i>

01:17:39.238 --> 01:17:42.833
<i>She's been moved by Dr. Champion.</i>

01:17:43.826 --> 01:17:46.249
The late Dr. Champion.

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:08.726
Shit.

01:18:10.102 --> 01:18:12.230
Driver, this is the highway patrol.

01:18:12.396 --> 01:18:15.070
Reduce speed, carefully pull
over to the side of the highway

01:18:15.232 --> 01:18:16.609
and turn off your engine.

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:32.292
God!

01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:50.313
Now, there it is!

01:18:51.352 --> 01:18:52.604
There.

01:18:58.317 --> 01:19:00.285
There she is! Police!

01:19:02.238 --> 01:19:03.740
Stop!

01:19:06.992 --> 01:19:08.665
Unh. Stop!

01:19:10.996 --> 01:19:14.250
My name is Angela Bennett.
I am Angela...

01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:16.418
My name...

01:19:16.585 --> 01:19:18.132
- Freeze!
- Police!

01:19:19.129 --> 01:19:20.756
My name's Angela Bennett.

01:19:22.466 --> 01:19:24.889
Get down! Get down! Get your
hands around back.

01:19:25.052 --> 01:19:27.396
Around the back!
You have the right to remain silent.

01:19:27.554 --> 01:19:29.874
If you give up the right to
remain silent, anything you say

01:19:30.015 --> 01:19:32.109
can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

01:19:32.268 --> 01:19:33.645
You have the right
to speak to an attorney

01:19:33.811 --> 01:19:37.691
and to have that attorney
present during questioning.

01:20:07.761 --> 01:20:10.105
<i>Look. I wanna help you.</i>

01:20:10.264 --> 01:20:11.561
<i>I've been appointed to help you,</i>

01:20:11.724 --> 01:20:14.102
but everything you're saying
is just so farfetched.

01:20:14.268 --> 01:20:19.650
They've changed your name, your friend's
medical records, crashed planes, because...

01:20:20.566 --> 01:20:22.534
Just think about it.
Just think about it.

01:20:22.693 --> 01:20:25.993
Our whole world is sitting
there on a computer.

01:20:26.155 --> 01:20:30.251
It's in the computer. Everything.
Your DMV records,

01:20:30.409 --> 01:20:33.959
your social security,
your credit cards,

01:20:34.121 --> 01:20:37.045
your medical history,
it's all right there.

01:20:37.207 --> 01:20:40.211
Everyone is stored, and there's
like this little electronic shadow

01:20:40.377 --> 01:20:44.302
on each and every one of us that's just
begging for somebody to screw with.

01:20:44.465 --> 01:20:46.433
And you know what?
They've done it to me,

01:20:46.592 --> 01:20:48.435
and you know what?
They're gonna do it to you.

01:20:48.594 --> 01:20:50.847
Look, Miss Marx...
Um...

01:20:51.013 --> 01:20:53.015
I'm not Ruth Marx, okay?
They invented her.

01:20:53.182 --> 01:20:55.276
They put her on your
computer with my thumbprint.

01:20:55.434 --> 01:21:00.031
I hate to tell you this, but the
California criminal justice computers,

01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:04.285
all of them, have been protected by
the Gatekeeper security programs

01:21:04.443 --> 01:21:09.574
for the last six months, so nothing that
you're describing could possibly happen.

01:21:15.704 --> 01:21:18.048
Oh, my God.
It's the program, then.

01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:20.630
It's the Gatekeeper program.

01:21:20.793 --> 01:21:23.137
It's got... It has a flaw.

01:21:23.295 --> 01:21:27.141
If they changed my identity and it has a
flaw, then the praetorians know this.

01:21:27.466 --> 01:21:29.810
Then that solves it.
Yeah. Think about it.

01:21:29.968 --> 01:21:33.472
No. You want to tell me again
how you ended up in a stolen car?

01:21:33.639 --> 01:21:36.392
Okay. Okay, listen to me.
It's like...

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:38.526
It's like
a Trojan horse, this thing.

01:21:38.685 --> 01:21:43.156
The praetorians, they hack into
computers and they cause this chaos.

01:21:43.315 --> 01:21:45.818
Um, LAX. Uh, Wall Street.

01:21:45.984 --> 01:21:49.454
Um, the Department of Water
and Power in Atlanta.

01:21:49.613 --> 01:21:52.213
They do this so the people, they
go out and they buy this program.

01:21:52.324 --> 01:21:55.328
They buy this program and
they get a false sense of security,

01:21:55.494 --> 01:21:58.054
only to find out that they've
unwittingly allowed the praetorians

01:21:58.163 --> 01:22:01.007
free and exclusive access
to the system. Do you get it?

01:22:01.166 --> 01:22:04.761
Imagine what they can do with
this power. They could do anything.

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:08.015
This is absolutely fascinating,
Ms. Marx.

01:22:08.173 --> 01:22:10.267
Please. My name is Bennett.

01:22:10.426 --> 01:22:12.428
Write it down if you want.
It's Bennett.

01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:16.599
B-E-N-N-E-T-T. Bennett.

01:22:18.016 --> 01:22:20.360
I have no reason to
make any of this up.

01:22:20.519 --> 01:22:22.692
As your court-appointed attorney,

01:22:22.855 --> 01:22:25.529
I'm obligated to do what you wish,

01:22:25.691 --> 01:22:29.696
so I will call you "Cleopatra,
Queen of the Nile" if you want.

01:22:29.862 --> 01:22:31.739
But take some advice.

01:22:31.905 --> 01:22:34.283
If you go before the judge
with this craziness,

01:22:34.450 --> 01:22:38.876
I guarantee you will be found
incompetent to stand trial,

01:22:39.037 --> 01:22:41.836
and they will hold you indefinitely.

01:22:57.014 --> 01:22:59.483
Hi.
Yeah, this is her daughter.

01:23:05.814 --> 01:23:07.532
Hi, Mom.

01:23:08.817 --> 01:23:10.069
It's me.

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:14.202
How are you doing?
You doing okay?

01:23:15.449 --> 01:23:19.170
Yeah? How's that
new nurse treating... Is she...

01:23:19.328 --> 01:23:24.380
Um, uh... It's Angela, Mom.

01:23:25.959 --> 01:23:28.758
Uh, it's Angela.

01:23:29.546 --> 01:23:31.514
Mom, listen. Um...

01:23:32.633 --> 01:23:34.101
I need you to do something for me.

01:23:34.259 --> 01:23:38.264
Um, there's a lady here
that I need for you...

01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:41.855
She's gonna get on the phone, and I
need for you to tell her that she's...

01:23:42.017 --> 01:23:43.394
That I'm me, okay?

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:46.655
Because she doesn't believe me.

01:23:46.813 --> 01:23:50.317
Can you tell her that, Mom?

01:23:50.484 --> 01:23:52.452
Mom, don't. No.

01:23:53.862 --> 01:23:55.330
Are you there?

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:02.171
I just want
you to know that I love you and...

01:24:09.670 --> 01:24:10.762
Lady.

01:24:17.302 --> 01:24:18.394
What?

01:24:21.473 --> 01:24:22.565
What?

01:24:25.978 --> 01:24:28.322
Would somebody answer
the damn phone?

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:31.859
Here she is.
Who's come to get me? Can you just...

01:24:32.025 --> 01:24:34.153
Special agent Ben Phillips, FBI.

01:24:34.319 --> 01:24:36.162
I'm Alan's friend.

01:24:36.321 --> 01:24:39.165
It's a terrible thing,
what happened to him.

01:24:39.324 --> 01:24:42.749
I'm... I'm so glad
that you're here. I...

01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:45.039
Angela, two seconds
after Alan told me your story,

01:24:45.205 --> 01:24:47.046
half the agents
in the Computer Crimes Division

01:24:47.165 --> 01:24:49.008
hit the bricks chasing this down,

01:24:49.167 --> 01:24:53.297
most of them beating every bush from
here to eternity trying to find you.

01:24:53.463 --> 01:24:55.966
Sorry it ended up being
in a place like this.

01:24:56.133 --> 01:24:57.931
Yeah, me too.

01:24:58.093 --> 01:25:00.972
Let's get out of here,
get you someplace safe.

01:25:01.138 --> 01:25:03.266
We've got a field office
about 40 minutes from here.

01:25:03.432 --> 01:25:04.684
Okay, and then what do we do?

01:25:04.850 --> 01:25:06.978
Oh, then I'm going fishing.

01:25:07.144 --> 01:25:09.442
A shark named Jack Devlin.
Ring any bells?

01:25:09.605 --> 01:25:10.652
Yeah.

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:15.820
He's their one-man dirty-duty
squad. Smart, efficient, lethal.

01:25:15.986 --> 01:25:19.286
Moral conscience of a chain saw.
Hm.

01:25:19.448 --> 01:25:23.203
Scary a son of a bitch as he is, the guys
behind the keyboards, they're worse.

01:25:23.368 --> 01:25:24.585
The praetorians.

01:25:24.745 --> 01:25:28.090
Our first good lead. We've been
chasing them for years.

01:25:28.248 --> 01:25:30.216
Look, we have to move
like ASAP here,

01:25:30.375 --> 01:25:33.174
so I want you to start sketching
me a quick background, all right?

01:25:33.337 --> 01:25:34.759
Okay. Um...

01:25:34.921 --> 01:25:37.640
Like, uh, for instance, how the hell

01:25:37.799 --> 01:25:39.640
did you access their
system in the first place?

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:42.764
I didn't. A programmer
at Cathedral sent the disk to me.

01:25:45.057 --> 01:25:48.778
Goddamn disk. That's what
kick-started all this, huh?

01:25:51.146 --> 01:25:53.740
Angie. Angie, tell me.

01:25:53.899 --> 01:25:55.651
Did you make a copy of the disk?

01:25:55.817 --> 01:25:58.411
I mean, before it was
ruined in Mexico.

01:25:59.738 --> 01:26:00.785
Huh?

01:26:07.663 --> 01:26:08.960
No.

01:26:09.122 --> 01:26:11.216
Oh, damn.

01:26:12.334 --> 01:26:15.884
<i>Disk is only
hope we have of catching these bastards.</i>

01:26:16.046 --> 01:26:19.596
Did you talk to anyone, give
copies of the disk to anyone?

01:26:20.592 --> 01:26:22.435
You guys are amazing
sons of bitches.

01:26:22.594 --> 01:26:24.517
Excuse me?
Amazing. Amazing, amazing.

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:26.682
Huh?
How'd you know it was ruined?

01:26:26.848 --> 01:26:28.521
How'd you know it was ruined?

01:26:28.684 --> 01:26:31.654
I only told Devlin it was ruined.
How'd you know it was ruined? Huh?

01:26:31.812 --> 01:26:36.113
What's your name? You're not even
with the FBI. It doesn't even matter.

01:26:36.274 --> 01:26:39.904
Ever since I touched that disk, I've been
running from one nightmare to the next.

01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:43.040
You know what? I'm tired. I am out
of it. I'm so out of it. I'm tired.

01:26:44.866 --> 01:26:47.836
Hey! What are you doing?
Come on, get off the gas!

01:26:47.994 --> 01:26:50.747
<i>Let go! You're gonna kill us!
You'll kill us both!</i>

01:26:50.914 --> 01:26:52.962
Let go!

01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:56.461
My seat belt!

01:28:41.274 --> 01:28:42.526
<i>On a serious note,</i>

01:28:42.692 --> 01:28:45.813
<i>after what has appeared to be a month of
playful but costly computer tampering,</i>

01:28:45.821 --> 01:28:47.994

has taken a darker turn.</i>

01:28:48.156 --> 01:28:51.581
<i>We go live to Dermot Conley

01:28:51.743 --> 01:28:54.747
<i>Police were called in as the
recent comedy of computer errors</i>

<i>turned ugly today when six of Chicago's
major banks were forced to shut their doors</i>

01:28:59.376 --> 01:29:01.174
<i>due to massive computer tampering,</i>

01:29:01.336 --> 01:29:03.964
<i>bringing the economic life of
this city to a halt.</i>

01:29:04.130 --> 01:29:05.973
<i>As you can see,
it's a desperate situation.</i>

01:29:06.132 --> 01:29:07.759
<i>Essential city services
will be conducted</i>

01:29:07.926 --> 01:29:10.395
<i>through the one local bank
unaffected by the glitches.</i>

01:29:10.554 --> 01:29:12.602
<i>That bank, National Fidelity,
sources say,</i>

01:29:12.764 --> 01:29:16.985

aptly named Gatekeeper program.</i>

<i>Reporting live from Chicago's

01:29:19.855 --> 01:29:21.072

<i>Information is power,</i>

01:32:12.068 --> 01:32:14.571
Me. Okay.

01:32:17.282 --> 01:32:18.784

Hello?

Who the hell is this?

01:32:45.018 --> 01:32:49.194
Hello. Look, you got
something to say? Otherwise...

01:32:49.355 --> 01:32:50.823
Don't hang up.

01:33:00.742 --> 01:33:02.085
Angela?

01:33:29.437 --> 01:33:32.111
All right, Miss Bennett,
now that I know where you are,

01:33:32.273 --> 01:33:35.447

from your machine.

01:33:37.862 --> 01:33:38.954
<i>Hm.</i>

01:33:40.865 --> 01:33:43.414
How about I start a little fire,

right here?

01:33:48.498 --> 01:33:50.546
<i>This is a fire alarm.</i>

- Angela.
- What?

01:34:05.890 --> 01:34:08.313
Who are you? Our lady of asbestos?
There's a goddamn fire in the building.

01:34:08.476 --> 01:34:09.773
Yeah, yeah. Just a sec.

01:34:09.936 --> 01:34:12.314
Don't give me "a sec."
Let's go.

01:34:14.983 --> 01:34:17.827
Hang on.
Now! Come on!

01:34:32.208 --> 01:34:33.425
Okay.

<i>Mozart's ghost!

We're not going back!

01:35:52.664 --> 01:35:55.258
If there's a fire, where's the smoke?
There's no smoke.

01:35:55.416 --> 01:35:57.510
We're looking into it, ma'am.

01:36:06.010 --> 01:36:11.358
Okay, what's this? "Terminate all

Okay. Okay.

01:36:26.322 --> 01:36:28.620

<i>The fire department has advised

01:36:56.936 --> 01:36:59.109
Subnet 345.

Come on.

01:37:07.488 --> 01:37:10.332
Okay, where are you?
There you go.

01:37:11.993 --> 01:37:13.791
Come on. Come on.

01:37:15.330 --> 01:37:18.083
<i>Attention,

<i>Please return

01:37:30.678 --> 01:37:32.351
So you did do this, didn't you?

01:37:37.018 --> 01:37:39.316
<i>This was a false alarm.</i>
Come on.

01:37:39.479 --> 01:37:42.232
You gotta go to the john too, huh?

01:37:46.194 --> 01:37:49.289
Disk, disk. Where are you?
Where are your disks?

01:37:57.205 --> 01:37:59.173
Virus. Thank you, Dale.

01:38:15.348 --> 01:38:16.941
Okay.

01:38:17.183 --> 01:38:18.275
Save.

01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:26.318
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

01:38:26.484 --> 01:38:27.531
Come on.

01:38:29.946 --> 01:38:31.414
Save. Come on, come on.

01:38:34.242 --> 01:38:35.334
Yes.

01:38:38.746 --> 01:38:41.795
Thank you.
You're going to the convention.

01:38:55.805 --> 01:38:57.273
Oh, my God.

01:38:59.475 --> 01:39:00.476
Security.

01:39:03.354 --> 01:39:05.356
Had a break-in on the fifth
floor of Cathedral.

01:39:05.523 --> 01:39:08.777
You're looking for a female,
about 5'7", brunette.

01:39:28.713 --> 01:39:30.715
Did you see a brunette?
Did she come by here?

01:39:30.882 --> 01:39:32.008
Sorry, ma'am.
Nobody came by here.

01:39:32.175 --> 01:39:34.303
Only people coming and going
around here are firemen.

01:39:36.053 --> 01:39:37.225
Devlin.

01:39:58.159 --> 01:40:00.412
Where is she?
She's gotta be with the firemen.

01:40:00.578 --> 01:40:03.127
We have to find her now.
She's copied the disk.

01:40:03.289 --> 01:40:05.633
Well, how the hell did that happen?

01:40:05.791 --> 01:40:07.293
You were supposed
to get rid of everything.

01:40:07.460 --> 01:40:09.462
And you were supposed to have
put a bullet in her head a week ago.

01:40:09.629 --> 01:40:11.802
She should never have been alive
to make that copy.

01:40:14.675 --> 01:40:17.554
Heh. Smart.
Better call Gregg.

01:41:23.035 --> 01:41:25.458
She's gone to
the Moscone Center!

01:41:41.554 --> 01:41:44.057
Jesus, she could be anywhere.
Are you sure she's out there?

01:41:44.223 --> 01:41:45.975
She's out there, all right.

01:41:46.142 --> 01:41:48.941
And she won't be hiding
in some corner.

01:41:49.103 --> 01:41:50.946
She came here to use a computer.

01:43:39.505 --> 01:43:41.553
Get away from the computer.

01:43:44.218 --> 01:43:46.471
What did you think
you were trying to do?

01:43:46.637 --> 01:43:47.638
Save the world?

01:43:47.805 --> 01:43:50.149
No, not the world. Just myself.
Oh.

01:43:50.307 --> 01:43:53.811
Well, I'm afraid it's too late for that.
The offer's been withdrawn.

01:43:53.978 --> 01:43:56.822
You might wanna look at the screen,

01:43:56.981 --> 01:43:59.734
because everything on that disk
was just sent to the FBI.

01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:02.119
Everything.
So?

01:44:02.278 --> 01:44:05.657
So, proof that the Gatekeeper
program has a back door.

01:44:06.741 --> 01:44:08.368
My. my.

01:44:08.534 --> 01:44:12.835
Proof that Bergstrom and Dale's
murder were orchestrated by Gregg.

01:44:12.997 --> 01:44:14.715
Watch her.

01:44:14.874 --> 01:44:18.094
The beauty of the Gatekeeper system is
that we can get in and out of the FBI

01:44:18.252 --> 01:44:21.176
like it's the public library.

01:44:21.338 --> 01:44:22.555
It's a beautiful system.

01:44:24.884 --> 01:44:28.085
Let's finish the work and get the hell out
of here. These people make me nervous.

01:44:30.848 --> 01:44:34.193
No harm done. Everything
you've done will be wiped out

01:44:34.351 --> 01:44:36.274
by just escaping the system.

01:44:36.437 --> 01:44:37.780
Really?

01:44:48.783 --> 01:44:50.535
Goddamn it,
you're in the mainframe.

01:44:50.701 --> 01:44:53.921
It's eating through Gregg's entire
system, Devlin. Do something.

01:44:55.748 --> 01:44:58.877
It's a virus eating through Gatekeeper.
Shit!

01:44:59.043 --> 01:45:02.798
There's gonna be nothing
left. Everything will be destroyed.

01:45:04.757 --> 01:45:06.634
Take the far side!

01:45:38.499 --> 01:45:40.001
Angela, stop!

01:45:43.087 --> 01:45:44.088
Angela!

01:46:01.730 --> 01:46:02.822
Shit.

01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:07.612
Angela.

01:47:00.915 --> 01:47:02.292
Angela?

01:47:04.418 --> 01:47:06.546
It's just you and me now.

01:47:08.047 --> 01:47:10.926
Do you realize you've
changed everything?

01:47:12.676 --> 01:47:14.770
Yeah.

01:47:14.929 --> 01:47:20.151
One little stroke of the key and
you've wiped out my employer.

01:47:21.936 --> 01:47:24.985
You've canceled my contract.

01:47:25.147 --> 01:47:29.618
You've reversed everything they've
done to you, taken back your life.

01:47:29.777 --> 01:47:31.779
That's what you wanted, wasn't it?

01:47:33.530 --> 01:47:34.827
Angela?

01:47:51.882 --> 01:47:54.226
I knew you'd do the right thing.

01:48:30.337 --> 01:48:32.510
This is the latest virus checker.

01:48:32.673 --> 01:48:34.801
It's in this machine?

01:48:38.929 --> 01:48:40.169
It's not responding to anything.

01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:42.023
Try a new password.

01:49:26.185 --> 01:49:28.358
Excuse me, uh, miss.

01:49:29.730 --> 01:49:32.574
I can't remember what you
told me to plant.

01:49:34.318 --> 01:49:37.993
You know what? Why don't I
come outside and help you?

01:49:38.155 --> 01:49:41.329
<i>... surrounding

01:49:41.492 --> 01:49:43.870
