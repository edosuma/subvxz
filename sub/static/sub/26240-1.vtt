01:47.609 --> 01:49.652
<i>Hi, moms, Stephanie here.</i>

01:49.819 --> 01:51.196
<i>Today, as promised,</i>

01:51.362 --> 01:53.281
<i>I am gonna share my zucchini</i>

01:53.448 --> 01:54.824
<i>chocolate chip cookie recipe.</i>

01:54.991 --> 01:56.826
<i>But first, many of you</i>

01:56.993 --> 01:58.161
<i>have asked me for an update</i>

01:58.328 --> 01:59.704
<i>on the Emily situation.</i>

01:59.871 --> 02:00.955
<i>And for those of you</i>

02:01.122 --> 02:02.332
<i>who are new to my vlog,</i>

02:02.499 --> 02:04.459
<i>you should know my best friend</i>

02:04.626 --> 02:06.044
<i>Emily is missing right now.</i>

02:06.211 --> 02:07.796
<i>She asked me a simple favor -</i>

02:07.962 --> 02:09.005
<i>to pick up her son Nicky</i>

02:09.172 --> 02:10.215
<i>from school...</i>

02:10.381 --> 02:13.384
...which was five days ago

02:13.551 --> 02:16.137
and she hasn't
come back yet, so...

02:22.393 --> 02:24.103
I'm sorry.
We're all really worried.

02:24.270 --> 02:25.897
And I'm doing everything I can

02:26.064 --> 02:27.732
to help the police
track her down.

02:29.442 --> 02:32.403
But I'm realizing I don't know
her as well as I thought I did.

02:32.570 --> 02:34.155
It's like my mom used to say,

02:34.322 --> 02:35.990
God rest her soul, um,

02:36.157 --> 02:38.034
"Secrets are like margarine,

02:38.201 --> 02:40.662
"easy to spread,
bad for the heart."

02:40.829 --> 02:42.372
But as different as we are,

02:42.539 --> 02:44.415
I do consider Emily
my best friend.

02:44.582 --> 02:47.126
She is this wonderful,
elegant person.

02:47.293 --> 02:48.973
And our sons
brought us together, actually.

02:50.129 --> 02:52.215
<i>Well, you know,
for our new friends,</i>

02:52.382 --> 02:53.967
<i>I'll just start
from the beginning.</i>

02:54.133 --> 02:57.971
<i>I met Emily
a few weeks ago at school.</i>

02:58.137 --> 02:59.597
<i>It was
International Cuisine Day</i>

02:59.764 --> 03:01.391
<i>in my son's first grade class.</i>

03:01.558 --> 03:03.184
<i>And once again, I drew Sweden,</i>

03:03.351 --> 03:05.937
<i>which meant my famous
meatless meatballs.</i>

03:06.104 --> 03:09.190
You're all dead!
I killed everyone!

03:09.357 --> 03:11.317
Not me. I came back to life.

03:11.484 --> 03:15.154
I want to thank everyone who
participated in today's feast.

03:15.321 --> 03:16.364
Yay!

03:16.531 --> 03:18.533
Class, haven't we
learned so much

03:18.700 --> 03:20.326
about food
from all around the world?

03:20.493 --> 03:21.703
Yes!

03:21.870 --> 03:23.705
Give your parents
a big round of applause.

03:23.872 --> 03:25.206
That looks great!

03:25.373 --> 03:26.958
- Big smile!
- Oh, my gosh.

03:27.125 --> 03:29.043
Where does she get
all that energy from?

03:29.210 --> 03:30.295
What are you looking at?

03:30.461 --> 03:31.939
I think there's crystal meth
in those meatballs.

03:31.963 --> 03:33.883
Oh, parents, there's
a sign-up sheet on the board

03:33.923 --> 03:36.676
for our Fun Fair next week.

03:36.843 --> 03:40.471
Uh, please, Stephanie, don't
sign up for more than one job.

03:40.638 --> 03:43.516
I'm not sure everyone else
has had a chance to volunteer.

03:46.436 --> 03:48.236
Miles, sweetie, sweetie,
maybe just be careful

03:48.271 --> 03:50.857
with your fingers
with Nicky's truck, okay?

03:51.024 --> 03:52.864
- Has Nicky's mom volunteered?
- Emily? Please.

03:52.984 --> 03:55.304
She wouldn't know a sign-up
sheet if it bit her on the ass.

03:55.445 --> 03:58.072
God, it'd be my dream
to run PR for Dennis Nylon.

03:58.239 --> 04:00.116
Can you imagine all
the free shit she must get?

04:00.283 --> 04:01.367
- I know.
- Okay.

04:01.534 --> 04:02.934
I'm crossing myself
off decorations.

04:03.077 --> 04:05.397
I can leave that open for Emily,
then if she can't make it,

04:05.538 --> 04:07.338
I can still bring
my balloons and helium tank.

04:07.373 --> 04:10.126
Please tell me you don't
actually own a helium tank.

04:10.293 --> 04:12.587
I think lots of people
own helium tanks, Stacy,

04:12.754 --> 04:14.339
'cause kids love balloons.

04:14.505 --> 04:16.757
Do you not have one?
You a bad parent?

04:16.925 --> 04:18.551
I'm kidding.

04:18.718 --> 04:20.136
We're terrible parents.

04:20.303 --> 04:22.805
I think it's a perfect
plan, Stephanie.

04:22.972 --> 04:25.266
Good thinking, Stephanie.

04:27.435 --> 04:29.145
Hey, Smooch!

04:29.312 --> 04:31.356
Oh, great work
today, Smooch.

04:31.522 --> 04:32.690
Smooch?

04:32.857 --> 04:34.651
- Thanks a lot, Mom.
- Oh.

04:34.817 --> 04:36.653
Can me and Miles
have a play date today?

04:36.819 --> 04:38.196
Um, I don't know, sweetie.

04:38.363 --> 04:39.822
I think we need
to ask your mommy

04:39.989 --> 04:41.407
and she's still in the city.

04:41.574 --> 04:42.659
She's right there.

05:06.641 --> 05:08.059
Come here, little dude.

05:08.226 --> 05:10.895
Oh, my baby!

05:11.062 --> 05:13.731
Look at your shirt. Did any
food make it into your mouth?

05:13.898 --> 05:15.692
Ask her, Nicky! Ask her!

05:15.858 --> 05:18.152
- Ask me what?
- We want a play date.

05:18.319 --> 05:20.196
Oh, we can't, Mommy
already has a play date

05:20.363 --> 05:22.156
with a symphony
of anti-depressants.

05:22.323 --> 05:23.992
- Let's go.
- Play date! Play date!

05:24.158 --> 05:25.761
- Play date!
- Baby, please don't do this.

05:25.785 --> 05:28.246
I gotta go. Come on.
I got a ton of work to do.

05:28.413 --> 05:30.665
- You don't let me have any fun.
- That's not true.

05:30.832 --> 05:32.667
I let you tear my labia

05:32.834 --> 05:34.836
as you exited my body,
so you're welcome.

05:38.089 --> 05:40.717
Do you drink? I need a martini.

05:40.883 --> 05:43.720
Oh! Uh... Yeah. I like martinis.

05:43.886 --> 05:46.472
I haven't had one in a long
time. They're good, though.

05:46.639 --> 05:48.474
I had one that was, like,
mostly chocolate

05:48.641 --> 05:50.226
and I was like,
"Alcohol and chocolate?

05:50.393 --> 05:51.894
"Oh, mom life!"

05:52.061 --> 05:54.897
Oh, okay. No play date.
Come on, kid, let's go.

05:55.064 --> 05:59.444
- Then I'm staying here.
- Christ, he's fucking stubborn.

05:59.610 --> 06:01.630
It doesn't have to have
the chocolate in it, like...

06:01.654 --> 06:05.033
Okay, I don't think
I'm gonna win this, so, um...

06:05.199 --> 06:08.161
I mean, do you wanna come over
for a beverage of any kind?

06:08.327 --> 06:09.996
I think I could use some backup.

06:10.163 --> 06:11.748
That's me? I'm backup?

06:11.914 --> 06:13.332
Does your kid drink, maybe?

06:13.499 --> 06:15.477
I mean, it's never too early
to start teaching them.

06:15.501 --> 06:17.503
I think you're joking,
but great.

06:17.670 --> 06:19.047
- Sweetie...
- Hey, you, let's go.

06:19.213 --> 06:20.524
Let's get your
umbrella out, okay?

06:20.548 --> 06:22.216
'Cause we're gonna
go out in the rain.

06:23.259 --> 06:25.219
What on Earth are
those two gonna talk about?

06:25.386 --> 06:28.389
Emily's gonna eat
poor Stephanie alive.

06:28.556 --> 06:30.892
At least she'd
be eating something.

06:31.059 --> 06:33.978
What is your problem?

06:41.194 --> 06:43.780
Go show him
your room. Go.

06:43.946 --> 06:45.406
Oh, please don't run!

06:45.573 --> 06:47.450
Be safe please!

06:49.494 --> 06:50.661
Cute socks.

06:50.828 --> 06:52.914
Oh, thanks!

06:53.081 --> 06:54.721
They're from Target.
It's 10 bucks a pack.

06:54.791 --> 06:56.167
- It's so great, Target.
- Yeah.

06:56.334 --> 06:57.710
They have other animals.

06:57.877 --> 06:59.480
They have these
squirrel ones that are cute,

06:59.504 --> 07:02.423
they have chipmunks, beavers...

07:02.590 --> 07:05.927
That's so... lifelike.

07:06.094 --> 07:08.221
Yeah. Do you like it?

07:08.387 --> 07:11.224
How could you not?
It's, um...

07:11.390 --> 07:12.767
Right?

07:12.934 --> 07:15.061
Yeah, I used to dye my hair.
I get bored easily.

07:15.228 --> 07:16.938
Yeah. Um...

07:17.105 --> 07:19.565
- Did you paint that?
- No. No, no.

07:19.732 --> 07:21.400
It's made by an
almost-famous painter.

07:21.567 --> 07:23.027
From the East Village.

07:23.194 --> 07:24.904
My life is littered
with almost-somebodies.

07:25.071 --> 07:26.614
I did some art modeling
in school

07:26.781 --> 07:28.324
to pay my way through.

07:28.491 --> 07:30.243
Then the pervert
got obsessed with me.

07:30.409 --> 07:31.994
Oh, well,
that happens, yeah.

07:32.161 --> 07:33.538
So I stole the painting,
you know,

07:33.704 --> 07:35.224
thinking it'd be worth
something someday.

07:35.248 --> 07:37.542
But no.
No such luck.

07:39.877 --> 07:41.671
This house is incredible.

07:41.838 --> 07:43.256
Thanks.
It's a fucking money pit.

07:43.422 --> 07:45.716
- Oopsy.
- Hmm?

07:45.883 --> 07:47.510
Oh, sorry, it's, um,

07:47.677 --> 07:49.554
what we say at my house
when someone swears.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.097
It's a force of habit.

07:51.264 --> 07:54.225
We have an... an 'oopsy' jar
in the pantry.

07:54.392 --> 07:58.187
It's like, you know, put
a quarter in for every bad word.

07:58.354 --> 07:59.981
You should smash
the 'oopsy' jar.

08:00.148 --> 08:02.984
- It might change your life.
- Yeah. Ugh! Sorry.

08:03.151 --> 08:05.027
Don't say sorry.
You don't need to do that.

08:05.194 --> 08:07.613
You don't need to apologize.
It's a fucked-up female habit.

08:07.780 --> 08:09.580
You don't need to be sorry
for anything, ever.

08:09.699 --> 08:11.826
That's... that's true.
That's great advice.

08:11.993 --> 08:13.327
Thank you.

08:14.704 --> 08:16.122
I love this music,
by the way.

08:16.289 --> 08:17.665
Thanks. Yeah.

08:17.832 --> 08:19.709
Makes me forget
I'm stuck in this shithole.

08:19.876 --> 08:22.461
- I'm gonna go get booze.
- Great!

08:49.197 --> 08:51.699
I was really caught up
in the ambiance.

08:54.076 --> 08:56.495
Come on,
give me a little more.

08:56.662 --> 08:59.123
Ooh!

08:59.290 --> 09:01.334
No, I liked it.
I may join you later.

09:01.500 --> 09:04.587
Oh! You must love cooking
in this kitchen.

09:04.754 --> 09:06.756
No, not really. Sean does.

09:06.923 --> 09:10.176
I think it's probably just
an excuse to avoid writing.

09:10.343 --> 09:12.053
- Your husband's a writer?
- No.

09:12.220 --> 09:13.596
He wrote a book 10 years ago.

09:13.763 --> 09:15.223
It made him
the toast of the town.

09:15.389 --> 09:18.184
I actually had to stalk him to
make him fall in love with me.

09:18.351 --> 09:20.811
But then nothing. He never
wrote anything ever again.

09:20.978 --> 09:23.356
- It's the old bait-and-switch.
- What was the book?

09:23.522 --> 09:25.149
It's called
'Darkness at Dawn'.

09:25.316 --> 09:28.027
Oh, my gosh! I read that
in my book club.

09:28.194 --> 09:29.314
- Really?
- This was... Yeah.

09:29.445 --> 09:31.285
This was back when
I first became a single mom.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.765
I joined this book club and
that was the first book we read.

09:33.908 --> 09:35.493
It's... Oh, it's so impressive.

09:35.660 --> 09:37.245
So you're divorced, then?

09:37.411 --> 09:39.580
Widowed.

09:41.374 --> 09:43.084
Do you mind if I ask
how he died?

09:52.385 --> 09:54.262
Car accident.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.389
- Oh. How awful.
- Yeah.

09:57.473 --> 09:59.558
My brother Chris was in
the passenger seat, so...

09:59.725 --> 10:01.185
You're kidding.

10:01.352 --> 10:02.728
One fell swoop, and the two

10:02.895 --> 10:04.455
most important men
in my life were gone.

10:04.522 --> 10:06.983
Normally, sad stories
don't get to me.

10:07.149 --> 10:09.568
But that one... that one did.
That was brutal.

10:09.735 --> 10:11.362
I don't talk about it a lot,

10:11.529 --> 10:12.905
especially with people
I just met.

10:13.072 --> 10:14.991
I'm really sorry.
Oh! Mmm...

10:15.157 --> 10:16.277
Baby, if you
apologize again,

10:16.409 --> 10:18.129
I'm gonna have to slap
the sorry out of you.

10:18.244 --> 10:19.870
Yeah. That's...
I'm not sorry.

10:20.037 --> 10:21.747
That's a hard habit
to break, though.

10:21.914 --> 10:23.124
It is.

10:23.291 --> 10:24.875
So, are you dating anyone?

10:25.042 --> 10:27.461
No. Slim pickings in Warfield.

10:27.628 --> 10:30.089
Well, you are an hour
and a half outside the city.

10:30.256 --> 10:33.467
I'm not gonna date someone
from the city.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.303
I tried eHarmony for a while,

10:35.469 --> 10:36.949
and then that
mother of three wound up

10:37.096 --> 10:38.472
with her head
in the trash can.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.099
You remember that?
And I... Ugh.

10:40.266 --> 10:42.059
I said, "No thank you. Delete."

10:42.226 --> 10:43.602
What?

10:43.769 --> 10:46.439
Come on, baby.
You're too sexy to give up.

10:46.605 --> 10:49.775
That's nice.
I don't know. Um...

10:49.942 --> 10:51.777
If your head's gonna
end up in a trash can,

10:51.944 --> 10:53.612
your head's gonna end up
in a trash can.

10:53.779 --> 10:56.198
I just didn't think I would
end up a single mom,

10:56.365 --> 10:58.200
struggling to make ends meet.

10:58.367 --> 10:59.847
I mean, my husband
had life insurance,

10:59.910 --> 11:01.287
thank goodness, but not a lot.

11:01.454 --> 11:03.134
I put half of that away
for Miles' college,

11:03.164 --> 11:05.958
and so, with that coming in,

11:06.125 --> 11:08.794
the money still
runs out in 2020.

11:08.961 --> 11:10.921
- Thank God for life insurance.
- Yeah.

11:11.088 --> 11:13.358
My husband doesn't have anything
if it makes you feel better,

11:13.382 --> 11:15.676
but he does spend like
he's the man of the hour.

11:17.053 --> 11:18.429
Fucking have to pay
for everything.

11:18.596 --> 11:19.972
We can't even sell this house.

11:20.139 --> 11:21.599
We bought it during
the bubble and...

11:21.766 --> 11:23.267
I love your house.

11:23.434 --> 11:25.436
Don't dream of selling it.

11:25.603 --> 11:27.188
If I were you, I'd just...

11:27.355 --> 11:29.690
...I'd just bask in this kitchen
all day long.

11:30.983 --> 11:33.361
Then you should move in.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.488
Here. Cheers
to being house poor.

11:35.654 --> 11:37.281
Yes, cheers!

11:39.909 --> 11:41.827
Mmm... What?

11:41.994 --> 11:43.371
That's, uh...

11:43.537 --> 11:45.140
It's just another one
of my bad decisions.

11:45.164 --> 11:47.124
Yeah.
It's great.

11:47.291 --> 11:48.751
Is that a charity symbol?

11:48.918 --> 11:52.046
Yeah, Mother Teresa and I are,
like, the same person, so...

11:52.213 --> 11:54.340
It's a nice contrast
with your ring.

11:54.507 --> 11:56.300
Thanks. Yeah, this is
a family heirloom.

11:56.467 --> 11:58.677
It belonged to Sean's
great-grandmom and then his mom

11:58.844 --> 12:00.930
and she insisted that
I have it, so, you know...

12:01.097 --> 12:02.848
Whose Subaru
is blocking the garage?

12:03.015 --> 12:04.683
- Speak of the devil.
- Oh, that's mine.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.477
- I'm sorry...
- You're what?

12:06.644 --> 12:07.937
Mmm!

12:08.104 --> 12:10.064
Your wife is trying to get me
to stop apologizing.

12:10.106 --> 12:11.899
Well, maybe you can
get her to start.

12:12.066 --> 12:13.109
Ooh!

12:13.275 --> 12:14.443
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:14.610 --> 12:16.278
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:16.445 --> 12:18.280
Oh, martini time?

12:18.447 --> 12:20.408
- I'm sure it's 5:00 somewhere.
- Oh, my God.

12:20.574 --> 12:22.534
Did you just come up
with that cliche by yourself?

12:22.576 --> 12:26.080
- He's such a brilliant writer.
- I have to say, you inspire me.

12:26.247 --> 12:27.623
Not enough, apparently.

12:27.790 --> 12:30.071
"Why, thank you very much
for going to the grocery store,"

12:30.167 --> 12:32.920
he said, dripping with sarcasm.

12:33.087 --> 12:36.674
Oh, I figured you'd want a break
from not writing ever.

12:36.841 --> 12:38.217
Hah!

12:38.384 --> 12:41.137
With that fatal blow,
she won the joust.

12:41.303 --> 12:43.180
- Well played.
- Thank you.

12:43.347 --> 12:44.932
- This is Stephanie.
- Hi, Stephanie.

12:45.099 --> 12:46.684
Her kid goes to Warfield
with our kid.

12:46.851 --> 12:48.727
She read your book.

12:48.894 --> 12:50.438
I did. I loved it!

12:50.604 --> 12:52.004
It reminded me
of William Thackeray.

12:52.148 --> 12:53.858
- She really read it.
- Wow.

12:54.024 --> 12:56.360
Not many people trot out
Thackeray as a reference.

12:56.527 --> 12:58.237
Oh, I was an English
major at Barnard.

12:58.404 --> 12:59.780
It was pre-mommy brain.

12:59.947 --> 13:01.587
I did my thesis
on 'The Canterbury Tales'.

13:01.657 --> 13:03.534
"And with that word
Arcite gan espye,

13:03.701 --> 13:05.703
"whereas this lady
roamed to and fro."

13:05.870 --> 13:09.165
"And with that sight,
her beauty hurt him so."

13:10.833 --> 13:12.501
I'm sorry, do you guys
wanna get a room?

13:12.668 --> 13:13.919
Am I breaking this up?

13:14.086 --> 13:15.254
I like that.

13:15.421 --> 13:17.423
Hey, do you want me
to make you a drink?

13:17.590 --> 13:18.966
No. I'm good.
You guys enjoy.

13:19.133 --> 13:20.573
I'm gonna head upstairs
for a shower.

13:20.676 --> 13:22.178
Okay.

13:22.344 --> 13:23.846
Nice to meet you, Sharon.

13:24.013 --> 13:26.807
Y... yeah. It's lovely
to meet you.

13:26.974 --> 13:29.101
He's terrible with names.

13:29.268 --> 13:31.562
Oh, yeah. I mean,
Stephanie's crazy.

13:31.729 --> 13:33.772
Like, P-H? What?

13:33.939 --> 13:36.775
You guys are
such a cute couple.

13:36.942 --> 13:38.486
Yeah, we're on the verge
of bankruptcy,

13:38.652 --> 13:40.488
and we can't find
a decent nanny

13:40.654 --> 13:42.948
in all of Connecticut, so...

13:43.115 --> 13:44.450
Drowning.

13:44.617 --> 13:46.285
If you ever need me
to pick up Nicky

13:46.452 --> 13:48.078
after school
and take him to my house,

13:48.245 --> 13:51.081
even if you just need
the night off...

13:51.248 --> 13:54.668
- You'd do that for me?
- Yeah. Anything.

14:03.010 --> 14:04.386
<i>Hi, moms, Stephanie here.</i>

14:04.553 --> 14:05.804
<i>If it's your first visit</i>

14:05.971 --> 14:07.681
<i>to the vlog, a hearty welcome.</i>

14:08.724 --> 14:10.059
<i>Today's theme is friendship.</i>

14:10.226 --> 14:11.352
<i>So today I thought</i>

14:11.519 --> 14:12.937
<i>we would make...</i>

14:14.188 --> 14:15.648
<i>...friendship bracelets!</i>

14:17.107 --> 14:19.568
<i>I have never understood
these silly, hurtful divisions</i>

14:19.735 --> 14:21.862
<i>between working moms
and stay-at-home moms.</i>

14:22.029 --> 14:23.614
<i>Honestly, I have
found it difficult</i>

14:23.781 --> 14:25.241
<i>to make friends with either.</i>

14:25.407 --> 14:27.868
Emily! Hi. What's up, lady?

14:28.035 --> 14:29.495
<i>Hey, I was
wondering if I could</i>

14:29.662 --> 14:31.539
<i>take you up on your offer
to pick up Nicky.</i>

14:31.705 --> 14:33.374
<i>I'm in a meeting
with no end in sight.</i>

14:33.541 --> 14:34.917
Uh, yeah,
I'm happy to help.

14:35.084 --> 14:37.711
Actually, I just got this
jumbo set of Perler beads...

14:37.878 --> 14:39.505
<i>Yeah, yeah, okay.
You're the best.</i>

14:39.672 --> 14:42.341
Okay. Um, just does Nicky
have any dietary restrictions?

14:42.508 --> 14:45.553
<i>Yeah, just don't feed him
shit he doesn't like. Thanks.</i>

14:45.719 --> 14:48.013
Don't feed... Okay.

14:48.180 --> 14:50.724
Oh, my God, she's so funny.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.059
Whoo!

14:53.686 --> 14:56.188
No, no, no, Dennis,
this is what's gonna happen.

14:56.355 --> 14:59.024
I'm gonna do my job,
you're gonna take some pills,

14:59.191 --> 15:01.193
and then I'm gonna
call you later, okay?

15:01.360 --> 15:04.321
What? Oh, oh, I can't hear you!
I'm in an elevator.

15:04.488 --> 15:05.906
I am hungry for flesh!

15:10.369 --> 15:13.539
Oh, just Darth Mommy.

15:13.706 --> 15:15.457
It's this game we...
It's really silly.

15:15.624 --> 15:17.084
Honestly, his dad
was much better

15:17.251 --> 15:18.544
at the roughhousing stuff.

15:18.711 --> 15:20.546
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

15:20.713 --> 15:22.065
Don't denigrate
your good parenting

15:22.089 --> 15:23.567
to comfort me
for my shitty parenting.

15:23.591 --> 15:25.259
Oh, gosh,
no, Emily, that's...

15:25.426 --> 15:26.802
That's not
what I was doing at all.

15:26.969 --> 15:28.929
- I think you're a super mom.
- Oh, no, you don't.

15:29.054 --> 15:30.222
Come on, your kid had

15:30.389 --> 15:31.825
lobster bisque for lunch
the other day.

15:31.849 --> 15:33.529
I'm lucky if I remember
my kid's lunch box.

15:33.684 --> 15:34.935
Honestly, it's fine.

15:35.102 --> 15:37.730
The nicest thing I could do for
Nicky is blow my brains out.

15:40.941 --> 15:42.359
I'm kidding.

15:42.526 --> 15:44.320
Right. Yeah. Well...

15:44.486 --> 15:47.656
You do work in the city, so...

15:47.823 --> 15:50.117
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!

15:55.664 --> 15:57.041
Did you just
take my picture?

15:57.207 --> 15:58.917
I'm yearbook mom.

15:59.084 --> 16:00.836
Did I ask you
to take my picture?

16:01.003 --> 16:02.838
- Erase it.
- Oh, you look really chic.

16:03.005 --> 16:04.381
It's just for
"Faces and Places."

16:04.548 --> 16:05.716
Just for the other parents.

16:05.883 --> 16:08.844
Erase it or I'll slap a fucking
injunction on your yearbook.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.763
- Do you understand?
- Yeah. Okay.

16:10.929 --> 16:12.514
Yeah, it's gone.

16:12.681 --> 16:14.141
Whoa. Bye-bye.

16:14.308 --> 16:15.684
Don't do that again.

16:15.851 --> 16:17.394
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

16:17.561 --> 16:20.189
Or I didn't mean
to offend you.

16:20.356 --> 16:22.983
Um, I'm sure that stuff's really
sensitive in your industry.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.277
Oh, no. It's all good.

16:25.444 --> 16:26.630
I'm probably not
the kind of person

16:26.654 --> 16:27.756
you're normally friends with.

16:27.780 --> 16:30.199
Oh, you do not wanna be
friends with me. Trust me.

16:30.366 --> 16:33.327
Dennis, sweetie,
let's try this again. Um...

16:33.494 --> 16:35.913
Okay, I want you to go home
and chill the fuck out

16:36.080 --> 16:38.248
and don't ever call me
again. Bye.

16:39.375 --> 16:40.668
That's how
you talk to your boss?

16:40.834 --> 16:42.503
Yeah. You know,
you gotta go right at 'em.

16:42.670 --> 16:44.171
Especially the powerful ones

16:44.338 --> 16:46.006
or they will fuck you
in the face.

16:46.173 --> 16:48.592
Yeah, I get that.

16:48.759 --> 16:51.345
Wanna get out of here?
Mommy needs a drink.

16:51.512 --> 16:54.264
Yeah. Totally.

16:54.431 --> 16:55.933
Nicky!

16:57.017 --> 16:58.644
Okay, guys,

16:58.811 --> 17:00.813
I guess we're going.

17:00.979 --> 17:03.440
Hey!
Nicky, come! Now!

17:03.607 --> 17:04.983
Okay. I have a gift for you.

17:05.150 --> 17:06.568
- Please close your eyes.
- Mmm-mmm.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.253
Yeah. Hold out your
tattooed hand, please.

17:08.278 --> 17:09.821
This is happening.
I'll wait all day.

17:09.988 --> 17:12.657
- Are you propositioning me?
- Yes.

17:12.825 --> 17:14.367
Here. I made that for you.

17:15.703 --> 17:16.954
You made this for me?

17:17.121 --> 17:19.281
Thought it would go with that
pinstriped suit you have.

17:19.373 --> 17:20.874
Really? That... that's nice.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.252
No one does stuff
like this for me.

17:23.419 --> 17:26.088
I used to watch those
'Bewitched' reruns on TV Land,

17:26.255 --> 17:27.839
and I always thought
it was so classy

17:28.006 --> 17:29.341
when Darrin
would come from work

17:29.508 --> 17:30.968
and Samantha
would fix him a martini.

17:31.135 --> 17:33.470
So every time we do this,
I feel so high-tone.

17:33.637 --> 17:36.640
My God, you're such a nerd.

17:36.807 --> 17:39.685
Ugh. Fuck this.
I need a real martini.

17:39.852 --> 17:41.228
- This one's not real?
- Nope.

17:41.395 --> 17:43.522
Sean and I had the real thing
at Dukes in London.

17:43.689 --> 17:45.482
The key - frozen gin.

17:45.649 --> 17:47.985
And a frozen glass. Here.

17:48.152 --> 17:49.737
Move, bad martini!

17:49.903 --> 17:51.530
Okay.

17:51.697 --> 17:53.115
Little bit of vermouth.

17:54.158 --> 17:56.285
Swirl it around, dump.

17:56.452 --> 17:59.079
Don't you dare
touch that wash cloth.

17:59.246 --> 18:01.665
Then add in the gin.

18:02.708 --> 18:03.876
Mmm.

18:04.042 --> 18:05.169
Cut your twist.

18:07.504 --> 18:10.507
Squeeze it, out side out.
Get a nice little mist.

18:10.674 --> 18:12.593
Lick the edges. Voila.

18:12.760 --> 18:14.344
And don't add
fucking ice. Ever.

18:14.511 --> 18:15.804
We don't like ice anymore?

18:15.971 --> 18:17.598
That shit ruins everything.

18:17.765 --> 18:19.308
Tough day at work?

18:19.475 --> 18:21.275
I just need to hit
the reset button sometimes.

18:21.351 --> 18:22.853
Well, cheers.

18:23.020 --> 18:24.563
Cheers.

18:33.864 --> 18:35.741
Can you make me
one of those?

18:37.075 --> 18:38.619
Do I look reset?

18:38.786 --> 18:40.329
Because I feel reset.

18:41.455 --> 18:43.457
You smell good.

18:43.624 --> 18:45.209
What is that perfume?
You smell so good.

18:45.375 --> 18:46.975
- I wish I smelled like you.
- Thank you.

18:47.085 --> 18:49.588
It's one of Dennis'.
I could get you one.

18:49.755 --> 18:51.965
I could get you a bathtub full,
if you'd like.

18:52.132 --> 18:56.845
I would
love... love it, girlfriend.

18:57.012 --> 18:58.388
Thank you.

18:58.555 --> 19:01.225
I'm really unhappy with myself
for taking that picture...

19:01.391 --> 19:03.151
Oh, my God, are you
still talking about that?

19:03.310 --> 19:04.621
- It was so rude.
- Honestly, please.

19:04.645 --> 19:06.372
- Please, stop. Forget about it.
- Just like, "Ooh, paparazzo."

19:06.396 --> 19:08.836
You are so nice. I have no idea
how you've survived this long.

19:08.899 --> 19:10.943
I'm not as nice
as you think, so...

19:11.109 --> 19:12.444
Are you baiting me?

19:12.611 --> 19:14.863
No! I'm just saying.

19:16.782 --> 19:19.201
- Everybody has a dark side.
- Mmm-hmm.

19:19.368 --> 19:21.208
Some of us are better
at hiding it than others.

19:21.370 --> 19:23.038
Wanna trade confessions?

19:23.205 --> 19:24.790
- No, no. No.
- Come on.

19:24.957 --> 19:27.292
What's the wildest thing
you've ever done?

19:27.459 --> 19:29.378
Oh, I... No, I don't know.
I shouldn't.

19:29.545 --> 19:31.046
You go first.

19:31.213 --> 19:32.840
Okay, um...

19:34.007 --> 19:36.552
A few months ago,
Sean and I had his TA over

19:36.718 --> 19:39.888
for dinner and drinks,
and a threesome.

19:41.557 --> 19:43.308
Was Sean jealous of him?

19:43.475 --> 19:44.768
Did I say it was a him?

19:47.688 --> 19:50.649
That's very cool, sis.
Very cool.

19:50.816 --> 19:52.192
- You okay?
- Yeah!

19:52.359 --> 19:54.528
- I don't mean to freak you out.
- Hello!

19:54.695 --> 19:56.297
I'm not freaked out.
Maybe you're freaked out.

19:56.321 --> 19:57.801
- Okay.
- Because I'm not freaked out.

19:57.948 --> 19:59.408
I'm cool. I'm laissez-faire.

19:59.575 --> 20:01.243
Okay, laissez-faire.

20:01.410 --> 20:03.096
I mean, you're not exactly
a sexual maverick.

20:03.120 --> 20:05.914
And that's fine. You know,
prudes are people too.

20:07.666 --> 20:09.918
I wanna know
your secret. Tell me.

20:11.128 --> 20:13.338
My dad died when I was
a senior in high school.

20:14.715 --> 20:16.550
<i>And...</i>

20:16.717 --> 20:18.844
<i>...this boy showed up
to the funeral.</i>

20:20.220 --> 20:22.264
<i>His name was Chris</i>

20:22.431 --> 20:24.766
<i>and I guess he was
the spitting image</i>

20:24.933 --> 20:26.977
<i>of my father
30 years younger.</i>

20:29.521 --> 20:33.525
<i>My mom thought
she saw a ghost. It...</i>

20:38.655 --> 20:40.741
<i>And it turned out
he was my half-brother.</i>

20:42.993 --> 20:45.871
That's your whole secret?
That your dad had an affair?

20:46.038 --> 20:47.247
No!

20:47.414 --> 20:49.499
Okay, can you
just tell me your secret?

20:49.666 --> 20:52.127
Come on,
spill it, dark side.

20:52.294 --> 20:54.004
So, Chris...

20:54.171 --> 20:57.382
<i>It was too late for him to drive
home, so he stayed over.</i>

20:57.549 --> 21:00.844
<i>We stayed up all night,
talking and...</i>

21:01.929 --> 21:03.138
<i>My dad was...</i>

21:03.305 --> 21:05.807
My dad was really the person
who understood me.

21:05.974 --> 21:07.684
And he was gone, so...

21:08.769 --> 21:12.564
I was alone-alone
for the first time.

21:12.731 --> 21:16.276
<i>But he sees me, you know?</i>

21:16.443 --> 21:18.070
<i>Like, he really sees me.</i>

21:19.279 --> 21:22.074
And we just stared at each
other for the longest time.

21:23.158 --> 21:25.661
You can't be too drunk in my
house not to finish the story.

21:25.827 --> 21:27.371
- What happened?
- Uh, yeah. Uh...

21:27.537 --> 21:29.456
Okay, so, I don't know,

21:29.623 --> 21:31.792
maybe it's not so racy
where you're from, but...

21:31.959 --> 21:33.752
Stop avoiding.
Tell me what happened.

21:33.919 --> 21:35.319
<i>We stood there
for the longest time.</i>

21:35.462 --> 21:36.588
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

21:36.755 --> 21:38.548
<i>So I went in to hug him and...</i>

21:38.715 --> 21:40.342
<i>...and we kissed.</i>

21:40.509 --> 21:42.803
<i>I know. It's so gross.</i>

21:42.970 --> 21:44.096
- The end?
- Yeah.

21:44.262 --> 21:45.448
- You just kissed?
- Yeah, we kissed.

21:45.472 --> 21:47.391
You just kissed your brother?

21:47.557 --> 21:49.393
<i>- Yeah. It's so...
- What?</i>

21:49.559 --> 21:51.311
<i>Ugh. It's so lurid.</i>

21:51.478 --> 21:53.398
<i>It's my half-brother.
It's not my brother, but...</i>

21:53.480 --> 21:54.999
<i>It's your half-brother,
though? Oh, okay.</i>

21:55.023 --> 21:56.608
<i>- It's my...
- Yeah, there's more.</i>

21:56.775 --> 21:58.255
<i>- No. No, there's not more.
- Mmm-hmm.</i>

21:58.360 --> 21:59.695
No, no. Yeah, there is.

21:59.861 --> 22:01.905
- So...
- You fucked him.

22:02.072 --> 22:03.240
What?!

22:03.407 --> 22:04.783
<i>Was he good?</i>

22:04.950 --> 22:07.035
<i>That is so disgusting.</i>

22:07.202 --> 22:08.578
<i>I don't know...</i>

22:08.745 --> 22:10.205
<i>- You didn't fuck him?
- I don't...</i>

22:10.372 --> 22:12.350
<i>- Tell me you didn't fuck him.
- I don't know what...</i>

22:12.374 --> 22:13.709
<i>- Swear.
- I swear.</i>

22:13.875 --> 22:15.502
Swear on your dad's grave.

22:32.728 --> 22:34.771
Oh, my God.

22:37.607 --> 22:39.818
- Don't. No!
- You're a brotherfucker!

22:39.985 --> 22:41.486
Don't.

22:41.653 --> 22:42.863
This is good.

22:43.030 --> 22:45.282
Oh, my God!

22:45.449 --> 22:47.289
I've got a brotherfucker
taking care of my kid.

22:47.367 --> 22:48.761
I shouldn't have
even said anything.

22:48.785 --> 22:50.370
Brotherfucker!

22:50.537 --> 22:52.039
You know what? I don't know.

22:52.205 --> 22:54.183
- It's these stupid martinis.
- Hey, brotherfucker.

22:54.207 --> 22:56.519
- Do you wanna stay for dinner?
- I shouldn't have said anything.

22:56.543 --> 22:59.046
Yeah, I do wanna stay for
dinner. That would be lovely.

22:59.212 --> 23:00.672
I can't wait to see
what you cook.

23:00.839 --> 23:02.424
You know what?

23:02.591 --> 23:04.968
I'm gonna cook you
the best meal of your life,

23:05.135 --> 23:06.511
and you're gonna
feel really bad

23:06.678 --> 23:08.096
about being
so mean right now.

23:08.263 --> 23:09.639
- Brotherfucker!
- Ow!

23:09.806 --> 23:10.974
I like you!

23:11.141 --> 23:12.934
"Hi, moms,
Stephanie here.

23:13.101 --> 23:15.079
"Today we'll be talking about
the perfect first aid kit

23:15.103 --> 23:17.023
"so you're never left in need
during a crisis..."

23:21.068 --> 23:22.444
- Hi!
<i>- Stephanie!</i>

23:22.611 --> 23:23.779
<i>Thank God you picked up.</i>

23:23.945 --> 23:25.345
<i>Hey, I just have
a little emergency.</i>

23:25.489 --> 23:27.365
<i>Oh, really? That's
a coincidence. I was just...</i>

23:27.532 --> 23:29.868
<i>- I need your help.</i>
- Are you okay?

23:30.035 --> 23:32.704
<i>I'm fine, but I do need
just a simple favor.</i>

23:32.871 --> 23:34.331
<i>Can you grab
Nicky from school?</i>

23:34.498 --> 23:36.309
<i>Sean's in London, his mother
broke her fucking hip,</i>

23:36.333 --> 23:38.376
<i>and I got a big fire
to put out at work.</i>

23:38.543 --> 23:41.129
Oh, yeah. Oh, my God!
Poor Sean, poor you.

23:41.296 --> 23:43.715
Um... Anything
I can do to help. Yeah.

23:43.882 --> 23:45.550
<i>You're the best.
Hey, I gotta run.</i>

23:45.717 --> 23:47.344
<i>But I'll get you back
for this, okay?</i>

23:47.511 --> 23:49.262
Of course.
Nicky's in good hands.

23:49.429 --> 23:51.681
<i>Hey, Stephanie,
you're a good person.</i>

23:51.848 --> 23:53.266
<i>A true friend. I mean that.</i>

23:53.433 --> 23:56.353
Don't worry about it.
I will talk to you later. Bye.

24:01.608 --> 24:03.318
Freeze!
Do you know what I see?

24:03.485 --> 24:05.362
I see two boys
getting a play date!

24:05.529 --> 24:07.572
Yay!

24:07.739 --> 24:10.158
Stephanie, that's so great
you took the nanny job.

24:10.325 --> 24:11.743
- Nanny job?
- Yeah, for Emily.

24:11.910 --> 24:13.662
I know she was looking for one.

24:13.829 --> 24:15.122
Ahh.

24:15.288 --> 24:17.124
Well, that...

24:17.290 --> 24:20.377
We're just friends.
I'm helping her as a friend.

24:20.544 --> 24:22.587
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

24:22.754 --> 24:24.673
I didn't realize
you guys were so close.

24:24.840 --> 24:26.424
Well, we are!

24:26.591 --> 24:29.594
We drink martinis together.
Strong ones from London.

24:29.761 --> 24:31.481
Okay, boys, if you don't
wrestle in the car,

24:31.596 --> 24:32.756
I'm gonna
make you fruit pops!

24:32.889 --> 24:35.225
- Let's go, let's go!
- Yay!

24:37.018 --> 24:39.479
She doesn't know
she's working for free.

24:57.664 --> 24:59.040
<i>This is Emily Nelson,</i>

24:59.207 --> 25:01.376
<i>Director of Public Relations
for Dennis Nylon Holdings.</i>

25:01.543 --> 25:03.044
<i>Leave a message
or go fuck yourself.</i>

25:03.211 --> 25:06.381
Hey, uh, Em,
it's Stephanie. Um...

25:06.548 --> 25:09.176
I know you're probably
knee-deep in that crisis.

25:09.342 --> 25:11.237
But Nicky's asking when
you're coming to get him,

25:11.261 --> 25:12.762
and I don't know
what to say, so...

25:12.929 --> 25:14.723
Just let me know.

25:14.890 --> 25:17.601
And I hope you're hanging
in there. Give 'em heck.

25:17.767 --> 25:19.102
<i>Stephanie Smothers?</i>

25:19.269 --> 25:21.688
I'm a close friend of hers.
I'm watching her son.

25:21.855 --> 25:23.607
Can you just tell me
where she is

25:23.773 --> 25:25.192
and when she
might be back?

25:25.358 --> 25:27.694
Yeah, she's in Miami
for a few days.

25:27.861 --> 25:29.487
Did you wanna
leave a message?

25:29.654 --> 25:31.656
I'm... I'm sorry,
did you say a few days?

25:31.823 --> 25:33.342
Yeah, can you hold
for a second, please?

25:33.366 --> 25:35.086
<i>She didn't say
that it was gonna be a few...</i>

25:35.243 --> 25:37.704
Oh, for the love of Job. Ooh!

25:37.871 --> 25:40.081
<i>Yes.</i>

25:40.248 --> 25:42.584
Sean, hi! Um, it's Stephanie.
I'm so sorry to bother you.

25:42.751 --> 25:44.353
I got your number
from the school directory.

25:44.377 --> 25:45.712
Has something
happened to Nicky?

25:45.879 --> 25:47.214
<i>No! Uh, Nicky's fine.</i>

25:47.380 --> 25:50.634
He's... Yeah, sorry, he's fine.
He's here with me.

25:50.800 --> 25:54.471
Um, Emily, though,
asked me to watch him and...

25:55.639 --> 25:58.099
...that was two days ago,
and I haven't heard from her.

25:58.266 --> 26:00.685
<i>- Have you guys been in touch?</i>
- Christ, two days?

26:00.852 --> 26:02.229
<i>What'd she tell you?</i>

26:02.395 --> 26:04.231
She said she had
to put out a big fire.

26:04.397 --> 26:06.650
And I called her office
and they said she was in Miami?

26:06.816 --> 26:08.193
<i>Yeah, that sounds
about right.</i>

26:08.360 --> 26:09.736
I mean, I've played through

26:09.903 --> 26:11.183
some of these
emergencies before.

26:11.238 --> 26:12.614
<i>And once she knows
that Nicky's</i>

26:12.781 --> 26:14.574
<i>being taken care of,
she disappears</i>

26:14.741 --> 26:15.784
for quite some time.

26:15.951 --> 26:19.162
- Oh, fun! Um...
- I'm flying back tomorrow.

26:19.329 --> 26:21.373
I'll pick up Nicky as soon
as I'm on the ground.

26:21.539 --> 26:24.167
<i>- All righty?</i>
- Yea... All righty.

26:28.672 --> 26:29.923
Ah.

26:30.090 --> 26:31.925
Miss Canterbury Tales.

26:32.092 --> 26:33.635
Um, her assistant,
Valerie, said that

26:33.802 --> 26:35.404
she couldn't get in touch
with her either,

26:35.428 --> 26:38.974
which is weird 'cause it's
a work thing, an emergency.

26:39.140 --> 26:41.184
Some of the moms think
we should go to the police.

26:41.351 --> 26:44.104
Jesus.
Has it really come to this?

26:44.271 --> 26:45.772
Do you want tea?

26:45.939 --> 26:48.066
You know what? Let's do it.

26:48.233 --> 26:50.860
Not the tea. The police.

26:51.027 --> 26:52.445
- Sean?
- Yeah.

26:52.612 --> 26:53.989
The police are here.

26:54.155 --> 26:55.740
Okay.

27:01.871 --> 27:03.498
And when was the last time

27:03.665 --> 27:05.625
either of you heard from her?

27:05.792 --> 27:07.544
Three days ago.

27:07.711 --> 27:09.879
I was in London.
My mother broke her hip.

27:10.046 --> 27:11.756
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Thank you.

27:11.923 --> 27:13.591
And she said
it was a work crisis?

27:13.758 --> 27:15.927
Yeah, she has
a very high-profile job

27:16.094 --> 27:18.430
and a full staff
that she oversees.

27:18.596 --> 27:21.141
Most times when a woman
vanishes, she has a reason.

27:21.308 --> 27:23.059
What are you implying,
exactly?

27:23.226 --> 27:24.686
You two didn't have a fight?

27:24.853 --> 27:26.413
Something to make you
run off to London?

27:26.479 --> 27:28.199
Are you saying that
I broke my mother's hip?

27:28.315 --> 27:30.442
You leave town,
your wife takes off.

27:30.608 --> 27:32.569
Maybe there's, um,

27:32.736 --> 27:35.363
a close 'friend' she might
be spending some time with.

27:35.530 --> 27:37.198
Excuse me, that's very rude.

27:37.365 --> 27:39.326
He is a dedicated
husband and father.

27:39.492 --> 27:40.692
I have seen him with his wife.

27:40.827 --> 27:42.305
Let me tell you,
they've got more chemistry

27:42.329 --> 27:43.371
than a science fair.

27:43.538 --> 27:44.807
Just exploring
all avenues, ma'am.

27:44.831 --> 27:47.375
Well, that avenue is
a dead end, so you can drop it.

27:47.542 --> 27:50.128
And where's Emily's family?

27:50.295 --> 27:51.713
She doesn't have any.

27:51.880 --> 27:53.256
She was an only child,

27:53.423 --> 27:55.842
and her mother and father died
when she was a teenager.

27:56.968 --> 27:58.345
I'm sorry,
I didn't know that.

27:58.511 --> 27:59.911
We'll file
a missing person's report

28:00.013 --> 28:02.474
and contact you
in the next couple of days.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.059
If she doesn't turn up,

28:04.225 --> 28:06.311
we'll contact the local
authorities in Miami.

28:06.478 --> 28:08.813
Not planning any more trips,
are you, Mr. Townsend?

28:08.980 --> 28:11.941
No. I'm gonna be right here.

28:12.108 --> 28:14.986
I'm gonna be at my house
with my son.

28:15.153 --> 28:17.072
We can show ourselves out.

28:19.074 --> 28:21.034
God knows we've had
our troubles in the past,

28:21.201 --> 28:24.746
but I don't think she'd just
up and leave her child.

28:24.913 --> 28:27.874
No, God, she adores Nicky.
She wouldn't do that.

28:28.041 --> 28:29.709
She is an enigma, my wife.

28:29.876 --> 28:31.294
That's what drew me to her.

28:31.461 --> 28:32.837
It can also make her impossible.

28:33.004 --> 28:34.339
She can be so fiercely private.

28:34.506 --> 28:35.632
She sure doesn't
like having

28:35.799 --> 28:37.279
her picture taken,
I'll tell you that.

28:37.342 --> 28:39.342
I remember this one time,
she shut down my Facebook

28:39.427 --> 28:41.554
because I posted up
a family picture.

28:41.721 --> 28:42.931
Ugh. Social media
is so tricky.

28:43.098 --> 28:44.474
You can get close to her,

28:44.641 --> 28:46.267
but you can never
quite reach her.

28:46.434 --> 28:48.937
She's like a beautiful ghost.

28:49.104 --> 28:50.688
Never entirely there.

28:50.855 --> 28:52.232
That's so poetic.

28:52.399 --> 28:54.401
You know, that's why
you're such a good writer.

28:54.567 --> 28:56.444
I'm not a writer
anymore, Stephanie.

28:56.611 --> 28:58.321
I gave all that up just to chase

28:58.488 --> 29:00.031
this woman
for the rest of my life.

29:01.783 --> 29:04.119
I should order a taxi
and go home.

29:04.285 --> 29:05.787
Yeah.

29:05.954 --> 29:07.622
Oh, gosh, it's 1:25.

29:07.789 --> 29:09.916
They stop driving at 1:00 here.

29:11.751 --> 29:13.378
That couch pulls out, um,

29:13.545 --> 29:15.088
if you wanna stay over.

29:15.255 --> 29:16.798
I know Nicky would love it

29:16.965 --> 29:18.508
if you were here
in the morning.

29:18.675 --> 29:20.218
That would be lovely.

29:37.277 --> 29:38.778
Who wants
more B vitamins?

29:38.945 --> 29:40.113
- Yeah!
- I do!

29:40.280 --> 29:42.031
Yeah?
Are they nice?

29:42.198 --> 29:43.783
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Delicious?

29:43.950 --> 29:45.535
- Hi.
- Hey.

29:45.702 --> 29:48.121
Uh, what on Earth
are you making?

29:48.288 --> 29:49.956
These are
hangover smoothies.

29:50.123 --> 29:52.041
They get it
right out of you.

29:52.208 --> 29:53.501
And the kids love them.

29:53.668 --> 29:55.795
A little tip -
they have a full portion

29:55.962 --> 29:57.922
of vegetables in them
and they don't even know it.

29:58.089 --> 30:00.133
It's so hard to get kids
to eat their vegetables.

30:00.300 --> 30:02.177
Right?

30:02.343 --> 30:03.511
Mmm.

30:03.678 --> 30:04.971
Wanna try some?

30:05.138 --> 30:07.056
Great.

30:12.645 --> 30:13.980
Good?

30:16.941 --> 30:18.735
I think we should
get ready for school.

30:18.902 --> 30:21.654
Oh, school, school!

30:21.821 --> 30:23.573
<i>Hi, moms, Stephanie here.</i>

30:23.740 --> 30:24.782
<i>Today I'm making</i>

30:24.949 --> 30:25.992
<i>a new recipe I learned</i>

30:26.159 --> 30:27.243
<i>for a hangover smoothie.</i>

30:27.410 --> 30:28.786
<i>Uh, it's really nice.</i>

30:28.953 --> 30:30.163
<i>I especially want to thank</i>

30:30.330 --> 30:31.706
<i>everybody who's written in</i>

30:31.873 --> 30:33.374
<i>to ask about Emily.</i>

30:34.417 --> 30:36.211
<i>It's been four days now.</i>

30:36.377 --> 30:37.921
<i>So...</i>

30:38.087 --> 30:39.380
<i>The good news is that Sean</i>

30:39.547 --> 30:40.798
<i>is home from London,</i>

30:40.965 --> 30:42.050
<i>and he's working</i>

30:42.217 --> 30:43.635
<i>very closely with the police.</i>

30:43.801 --> 30:46.471
<i>Um, actually, moms,</i>

30:46.638 --> 30:48.181
<i>I know a lot of you</i>

30:48.348 --> 30:49.474
<i>are hung up on the idea</i>

30:49.641 --> 30:50.683
<i>that the husband</i>

30:50.850 --> 30:52.060
<i>is always the primary suspect.</i>

30:52.227 --> 30:54.062
<i>I know. I've seen 'Law & Order'.</i>

30:54.229 --> 30:55.605
<i>But, um...</i>

30:55.772 --> 30:57.815
<i>First, I'm here to tell you</i>

30:57.982 --> 31:00.568
<i>Sean was in London
when Emily disappeared.</i>

31:00.735 --> 31:02.862
<i>And some of you
have suggested</i>

31:03.029 --> 31:05.657
<i>that he did that
to set up an alibi,</i>

31:05.823 --> 31:09.744
<i>but he's an amazing husband
and an amazing father, so...</i>

31:09.911 --> 31:11.663
<i>The police
haven't been much help.</i>

31:11.829 --> 31:13.909
<i>But every mom knows if
you want something done right,</i>

31:13.957 --> 31:15.708
<i>you have to do it yourself.</i>

31:15.875 --> 31:17.835
<i>I will leave
no stone unturned.</i>

31:18.002 --> 31:19.546
<i>I think that's
what Emily would want.</i>

31:19.712 --> 31:21.256
Dennis Nylon, please hold.

31:22.340 --> 31:24.384
Dennis Nylon,
please hold.

31:25.468 --> 31:27.512
Thanks for holding.
How may I direct your call?

31:27.679 --> 31:29.055
Hi, my name is Stephanie...

31:29.222 --> 31:31.015
Dennis Nylon, please hold.

31:31.182 --> 31:32.701
My friend works here.
She's been missing...

31:32.725 --> 31:34.565
Thanks for holding.
How may I direct your call?

31:34.644 --> 31:37.647
- I tried to call her assistant.
- Dennis Nylon, please hold.

31:37.814 --> 31:39.232
Valerie? She wasn't
super helpful.

31:39.399 --> 31:41.210
Thanks for holding.
How may I direct your call?

31:41.234 --> 31:42.674
I can't tell
if you're talking to me.

31:42.735 --> 31:44.338
- You're looking right at me...
- Please hold.

31:44.362 --> 31:46.030
- Dennis Nylon, please hold.
- Okay...

31:46.197 --> 31:48.008
Thanks for holding.
How may I direct your call?

31:48.032 --> 31:49.200
Her name's Emily Nelson.

31:49.367 --> 31:50.952
She's the head
of the PR department.

31:51.119 --> 31:53.871
- Emily's not in today.
- I know she's not in.

31:54.038 --> 31:56.207
- Dennis Nylon, please hold.
- Okay.

31:56.374 --> 31:58.209
I'm just gonna...

31:58.376 --> 32:00.211
Sorry. No, I am not sorry.

32:00.378 --> 32:03.923
I need to speak
to Dennis Nylon, please?

32:04.090 --> 32:06.050
A woman's missing, so...

32:06.217 --> 32:07.760
Mr. Nylon's not here right now.

32:07.927 --> 32:11.097
- Great, I'll wait.
- Knock yourself out.

32:11.264 --> 32:12.599
Okay.

32:28.865 --> 32:30.491
Dennis Nylon, please hold.

32:30.658 --> 32:32.493
Um, Mr. Nylon?

32:32.660 --> 32:34.370
We don't accept
unsolicited resumes.

32:34.537 --> 32:36.080
Cool. That's not why I'm here.

32:36.247 --> 32:38.458
- Um, we have a problem.
- We most certainly do.

32:38.625 --> 32:40.603
A friend of mine works in
your publicity department...

32:40.627 --> 32:41.961
Is that a vintage
Hermes scarf?

32:42.128 --> 32:43.880
Um, my Aunt Frieda
gave it to me.

32:44.047 --> 32:45.715
Did she want you
to hang yourself with it?

32:45.882 --> 32:47.442
Look at that knot.
Jesus fucking Christ!

32:47.592 --> 32:49.010
I'm here about
Emily Nelson.

32:49.177 --> 32:50.417
What about Emily?
What happened?

32:50.553 --> 32:52.680
She asked me to pick up
her son four days ago

32:52.847 --> 32:54.307
because she went to Miami.

32:54.474 --> 32:56.074
She's still not back.
No texts, no calls.

32:56.184 --> 32:57.935
No one in your office
seems to give a crap.

32:58.102 --> 32:59.687
Excuse my language.

32:59.854 --> 33:01.481
- Kiko.
- Hmm?

33:01.648 --> 33:03.107
Why did Emily
go to Miami?

33:03.274 --> 33:04.817
I didn't know she did.

33:06.402 --> 33:08.655
We in this office
have learned that

33:08.821 --> 33:10.424
when Emily elects
not to tell us something,

33:10.448 --> 33:11.824
it's best not to ask.

33:11.991 --> 33:13.159
Doesn't she work for you?

33:13.326 --> 33:15.244
Emily's job
is to stop the apocalypse

33:15.411 --> 33:17.205
without worrying
any of the designers.

33:17.372 --> 33:18.748
And she always
finds a way

33:18.915 --> 33:20.291
to look fabulous
when she does it.

33:20.458 --> 33:21.834
That's great!

33:22.001 --> 33:23.920
What do you suggest
that I do?

33:24.087 --> 33:26.172
Never wear a vintage Hermes
scarf with a Gap T-shirt.

33:26.339 --> 33:28.459
If you were truly Emily's
friend, you would know that.

33:28.549 --> 33:30.677
Excuse me,
I have a very busy day.

33:32.762 --> 33:35.306
Valerie, my office, now!

33:50.363 --> 33:51.989
Hi.

33:52.156 --> 33:55.034
Sit, sit, sit!
Emily - I want answers. Speak.

33:55.201 --> 33:57.412
Steven,
you forgot the shirts.

34:08.255 --> 34:10.591
No, I can't
help you with that.

34:10.757 --> 34:12.135
Of course
he's freaking out.

34:12.301 --> 34:14.303
He needs someone
to manage this now.

34:14.469 --> 34:15.804
I don't know.

34:26.858 --> 34:29.152
Mother fudger.

35:00.057 --> 35:02.185
Well, if it isn't Aunt Frieda's
least favorite niece.

35:02.351 --> 35:03.853
What were you
doing up there?

35:04.020 --> 35:06.689
Corporate spying or just
a common garden shoplifter?

35:07.899 --> 35:09.776
Yeah, you gotta go
right at them.

35:09.942 --> 35:11.319
Especially the powerful ones

35:11.486 --> 35:13.112
or they will fuck you
in the face.

35:14.197 --> 35:15.677
Listen, you bargain basement
Tom Ford,

35:15.823 --> 35:17.843
if you don't have this Ken doll
unhand me this second,

35:17.867 --> 35:19.907
I will tell the thousands of
moms that watch my vlog

35:19.994 --> 35:21.914
that Dennis Nylon is a bully
who victimizes women

35:21.996 --> 35:23.640
and that they should stop
buying your tacky blouses

35:23.664 --> 35:25.166
made by Indonesian children

35:25.333 --> 35:27.293
because if you lose moms,
you lose business.

35:30.254 --> 35:32.840
Okay, number one, they are
not Indonesian children.

35:33.007 --> 35:34.759
They are Vietnamese
teenagers.

35:34.926 --> 35:37.595
Number two,
Tom Ford wishes he were me.

35:37.762 --> 35:41.057
And number three,
if I'm tacky,

35:41.224 --> 35:44.310
okay, you're...

35:44.477 --> 35:46.395
This has been fun.

35:46.562 --> 35:48.815
Better pray
I don't have a bruise.

35:59.325 --> 36:00.701
No wonder she doesn't like

36:00.868 --> 36:02.245
having her picture taken.

36:08.042 --> 36:09.502
Look
at our little Stephanie.

36:09.669 --> 36:11.712
Comforting
the worried husband.

36:11.879 --> 36:14.924
Oh, please. It's an arts
and crafts project.

36:15.091 --> 36:17.927
I've never seen her pass up
a chance to use a stapler.

36:18.094 --> 36:21.347
Emily's gonna hate those flyers
when she gets back.

36:21.514 --> 36:24.100
She's not coming back.

36:25.309 --> 36:26.686
Don't you watch 'Dateline'?

36:26.853 --> 36:29.730
If the case isn't solved
in the first 72 hours,

36:29.897 --> 36:32.066
they're always dead.

36:32.233 --> 36:33.776
Oh, yeah.

36:35.361 --> 36:36.654
Oh, perfect timing!

36:36.821 --> 36:38.531
Dinner's ready.
The boys are upstairs.

36:38.698 --> 36:41.826
I'm just gonna have them wash
their hands and come down.

36:41.993 --> 36:44.620
- Um...
- Are you okay?

36:44.787 --> 36:47.164
I've just never
experienced anything like this,

36:47.331 --> 36:49.792
walking into
a fully set dinner table.

36:49.959 --> 36:53.170
Yeah...
This is weird.

36:53.337 --> 36:55.298
- I'm being...
- No, no, no! Not at all.

36:55.464 --> 36:56.966
I think anything
stable these days

36:57.133 --> 36:58.509
is like a gift
from heaven, right?

36:58.676 --> 37:00.469
I should tidy up
first, though.

37:04.223 --> 37:06.142
- Oh, hey.
- Hello.

37:06.309 --> 37:07.351
- Mr. Townsend?
- Ah, yes.

37:07.518 --> 37:08.871
Detective Summerville.
We spoke on the phone.

37:08.895 --> 37:10.146
That's right. Um...

37:10.313 --> 37:12.291
Stephanie, can you help
the boys with their homework?

37:12.315 --> 37:14.025
Of course.

37:14.191 --> 37:15.735
- Come in. Sorry.
- Thank you.

37:15.902 --> 37:19.280
Just a pre-dinner snack.

37:20.948 --> 37:22.491
- That's a cute nanny.
- No, no.

37:22.658 --> 37:24.535
That's one
of my wife's friends.

37:24.702 --> 37:26.871
She's been helping me out.

37:27.038 --> 37:29.957
Oh, shit. Can she come
help out around my house too?

37:33.294 --> 37:34.670
The passenger manifest says

37:34.837 --> 37:36.631
she wasn't on
any flights to Miami.

37:36.797 --> 37:38.883
But she did rent
a white Kia from Budget.

37:39.050 --> 37:40.635
She paid in cash
for a two-day rental.

37:40.801 --> 37:42.678
Now, when people
pay in cash,

37:42.845 --> 37:44.388
that usually means one thing.

37:44.555 --> 37:46.474
What are you saying?
She's having an affair?

37:46.641 --> 37:48.081
I can't say that
with any confidence.

37:48.225 --> 37:49.685
Can you
not track the Kia?

37:49.852 --> 37:51.312
I have
toll booth reports coming in

37:51.479 --> 37:52.647
from across the country,

37:52.813 --> 37:54.333
assuming she's not
swapping out plates.

37:54.440 --> 37:55.983
I wanna get a description
of your wife

37:56.150 --> 37:58.778
to every precinct
in the tri-state area, okay?

37:58.945 --> 38:00.988
Did she have
any distinguishing features?

38:01.155 --> 38:02.740
Any birthmarks, tattoos?

38:02.907 --> 38:04.575
She's got a tattoo
on her left wrist.

38:04.742 --> 38:05.910
Oh, great.

38:06.077 --> 38:08.496
It's flames and a charity
symbol in the middle.

38:08.663 --> 38:10.498
Really?

38:10.665 --> 38:12.500
- More judgment from you?
- Nope. No, no, no.

38:12.667 --> 38:14.085
But she did
things like that.

38:14.251 --> 38:16.045
Impulsive, crazy things.

38:16.212 --> 38:17.755
I'm gonna go call this in.

38:17.922 --> 38:19.674
Tell your wife's friend
I said goodbye.

38:22.677 --> 38:25.054
You're a saint.
You don't have to do that.

38:25.221 --> 38:27.598
I'm not a saint. I just like
to keep my hands busy.

38:27.765 --> 38:29.475
Um... I should go.

38:29.642 --> 38:31.185
It's Flags of the World Day
on Monday.

38:31.352 --> 38:33.771
I haven't even started
on South America.

38:35.690 --> 38:37.274
Sorry.

38:37.441 --> 38:40.111
No, I don't mean sorry.
I mean thank you.

38:40.277 --> 38:42.279
Thank you for being
such a good friend.

38:42.446 --> 38:43.614
Of course.

38:43.781 --> 38:45.741
I'm a problem-solver.
I just wish I could do more.

38:45.783 --> 38:47.827
You're doing plenty.

38:55.459 --> 38:57.128
So, that's where
we are today.

38:57.294 --> 38:58.671
And we are keeping
our heads up

38:58.838 --> 39:00.339
and not jumping
to any conclusions.

39:00.506 --> 39:01.882
We are soldiering on

39:02.049 --> 39:03.968
with cookies and origami.

39:04.135 --> 39:06.303
But for you moms
who want to help,

39:06.470 --> 39:08.639
we know that Emily
was driving a white Kia

39:08.806 --> 39:10.433
that she rented
from a Budget

39:10.599 --> 39:12.852
at La Guardia Airport
on the 24th.

39:13.019 --> 39:14.520
And I did a little digging,

39:14.687 --> 39:16.981
so, um,
the license plate is...

39:23.237 --> 39:25.781
<i>Dear Stephanie, I'm
writing from Standish, Michigan,</i>

39:25.948 --> 39:27.324
<i>with a possible
Emily sighting.</i>

39:27.491 --> 39:29.285
<i>I was driving down I-75
two days ago,</i>

39:29.452 --> 39:31.328
<i>when I saw a woman
gassing up a white Kia.</i>

39:31.495 --> 39:33.581
<i>She was really pretty
and I remember thinking</i>

39:33.748 --> 39:35.548
<i>she didn't look like
she was from around here.</i>

39:35.624 --> 39:37.209
<i>I hope this help...</i>

39:38.377 --> 39:40.004
So, um,
Summerville sent the info

39:40.171 --> 39:41.714
to the local authorities
in Michigan.

39:41.881 --> 39:44.508
Did she ever mention Michigan?
Did she have a friend there?

39:44.675 --> 39:47.136
As far as I knew, she didn't
have any real friends.

39:47.303 --> 39:48.846
- Not before you.
- Oh.

39:49.013 --> 39:52.058
I... How is that possible?

39:52.224 --> 39:54.393
Hold on.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.645
Hello. Please
tell me you found her.

39:56.812 --> 39:58.522
A lake?

39:59.648 --> 40:01.609
Well, I don't know.

40:02.777 --> 40:04.236
Okay, I'm heading
there now.

40:04.403 --> 40:06.280
They found the rental car
in Michigan.

40:06.447 --> 40:07.823
Look, I'm gonna have to go

40:07.990 --> 40:09.742
'cause otherwise
I'm going to go crazy.

40:09.909 --> 40:11.869
- Can you do me a favor?
- Yes, it's done. Go.

40:13.245 --> 40:15.081
<i>Hi, moms. Stephanie here.</i>

40:15.247 --> 40:17.750
I can see we have
a flood of new viewers today.

40:17.917 --> 40:21.087
And if you're new
to the vlog, I'm sorry.

40:21.253 --> 40:23.173
This probably isn't
the best entry to start with.

40:23.339 --> 40:26.300
<i>For those of you who have been
following my vlog this week,</i>

40:26.467 --> 40:29.136
<i>you know that my best friend
Emily went missing.</i>

40:29.303 --> 40:32.640
<i>And so many of you wrote in with
your helpful tips and ideas.</i>

40:32.807 --> 40:37.061
<i>And I wanna give a special
thanks to Leanne Lippens</i>

40:37.228 --> 40:40.689
<i>whose helpful tip made
a major break in the case.</i>

40:42.483 --> 40:44.276
<i>I have some somber news.</i>

40:46.821 --> 40:48.405
<i>Emily was found.</i>

40:51.617 --> 40:53.536
<i>Not alive, I'm afraid.</i>

40:55.454 --> 40:57.706
<i>My friend Emily Nelson...</i>

40:59.166 --> 41:00.709
<i>...is dead.</i>

41:15.307 --> 41:17.393
Our Father,
we look to you again,

41:17.560 --> 41:19.645
facing this moment
of our need.

41:19.812 --> 41:22.690
In our sorrow,
grief and loneliness

41:22.857 --> 41:25.025
draw us up to yourself,

41:25.192 --> 41:27.778
that we may know the comfort
of the everlasting arms.

41:27.945 --> 41:29.738
Especially support
and comfort those

41:29.905 --> 41:33.200
who have been closest
to our departed sister.

41:33.367 --> 41:34.910
Sustain them
in the blessed assurance

41:35.077 --> 41:36.495
that death is conquered

41:36.662 --> 41:38.038
and new life is begun.

41:38.205 --> 41:39.957
To be absent from the body

41:40.124 --> 41:41.667
is to be present
with the Lord.

41:41.834 --> 41:43.669
May we be assured
in the hope

41:43.836 --> 41:45.337
that we shall
walk together again

41:45.504 --> 41:47.214
in your blessed presence.

41:47.381 --> 41:49.466
Help us to number our days

41:49.633 --> 41:52.428
that we may apply
our hearts unto wisdom.

41:52.595 --> 41:54.013
In the name of the Father,

41:54.180 --> 41:55.931
and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit.

41:56.098 --> 41:57.349
Amen.

42:04.857 --> 42:07.067
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

42:08.444 --> 42:09.820
Are those, um...

42:09.987 --> 42:11.739
Oh, yeah, yeah,
they are.

42:11.906 --> 42:14.450
They're from your
last-minute brownie entry.

42:14.617 --> 42:17.161
I can't believe
you watch my vlog.

42:17.328 --> 42:19.622
I mean, to be honest, when
we first started watching it,

42:19.788 --> 42:21.248
we were just
making fun of you.

42:21.415 --> 42:22.833
But, um...

42:23.000 --> 42:25.040
But then you had some
really helpful hints in there,

42:25.127 --> 42:26.879
especially when Lulu
got that rash.

42:27.046 --> 42:29.006
Apple cider vinegar
was great.

42:29.173 --> 42:30.716
Oh, well, great! That's...

42:30.883 --> 42:32.509
Yeah.

42:33.969 --> 42:36.180
You're a real saint to help
her family out like this.

42:36.347 --> 42:37.848
I'm not a saint.

42:38.015 --> 42:40.267
Emily was my friend, and she'd
do the same for me, so...

42:40.434 --> 42:41.936
If you or Sean need me

42:42.102 --> 42:44.647
to watch Miles or Nicky
anytime, it's nothing.

42:44.813 --> 42:46.690
That's so sweet, Sona.
Thank you.

42:46.857 --> 42:49.693
It's the least she could do.
She didn't even bake anything.

42:49.860 --> 42:51.654
- I'm gonna... Okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

42:52.780 --> 42:54.949
Nicky,
you don't need to worry.

42:55.115 --> 42:56.575
Your mom's in heaven now.

42:56.742 --> 42:58.494
No, she's not! Shut up!

42:58.661 --> 43:00.261
- Ow! Ow! Stop it!
- She's in the ground!

43:00.329 --> 43:01.538
She's never coming back!

43:01.705 --> 43:03.123
Ow! You're hurting me!

43:03.290 --> 43:04.792
- I hate you!
- Ow! Stop it!

43:04.959 --> 43:07.336
Nicky, get off him!

43:08.712 --> 43:10.232
Nicky, what are you doing?
Get off him!

43:10.339 --> 43:11.882
What the hell are you doing?

43:12.049 --> 43:13.926
- Calm down, stop that.
- She made this happen!

43:14.093 --> 43:15.594
- She made my mom die.
- That's crazy.

43:15.761 --> 43:17.656
- You know that.
- She's trying to be my new mom!

43:17.680 --> 43:19.115
Sweetie, I'm not trying
to be your mom.

43:19.139 --> 43:21.475
- I want my mom!
- I know you do, baby. I know.

43:21.642 --> 43:23.936
- But calm down.
- Mom was right. You are a loser!

43:25.187 --> 43:26.563
Is that what she told you,

43:26.730 --> 43:28.065
drunk at 2:00
in the afternoon?

43:28.232 --> 43:30.109
- I am trying my best!
- Sean!

43:30.276 --> 43:31.527
He's just a little boy.
Jesus!

43:31.694 --> 43:33.279
Nicky, I'm sorry.

43:33.445 --> 43:35.531
- What do I do? What do I do?
- Okay.

43:35.698 --> 43:37.509
We're all gonna take a deep,
centering breath now.

43:37.533 --> 43:38.909
Ready?

43:39.076 --> 43:40.786
We're gonna focus
on one thing at a time.

43:40.953 --> 43:42.329
I'm gonna stay
and talk to Nicky.

43:42.496 --> 43:43.914
So I need you
to take Miles inside,

43:44.081 --> 43:45.249
put some ice on his nose.

43:45.416 --> 43:47.334
'Cause you got
a good little shiner coming.

43:48.419 --> 43:49.795
- It's okay.
- Okay.

43:49.962 --> 43:51.922
It's okay. It's okay.

43:53.882 --> 43:56.427
I don't wanna talk to you.

43:56.593 --> 43:59.722
Well... you're not
my favorite dinner date

43:59.888 --> 44:02.016
right now either, buster.

44:02.182 --> 44:03.542
But you should know
that everything

44:03.642 --> 44:05.311
you're feeling right now
is normal.

44:05.477 --> 44:07.396
You can act out
all you want. That's fine.

44:07.563 --> 44:09.231
This doesn't change
what I know.

44:09.398 --> 44:12.192
- What do you know?
- That you're a good kid.

44:15.029 --> 44:16.905
So let's just sit here
and not talk.

44:18.615 --> 44:20.576
Let's just sit here and...

44:20.743 --> 44:23.203
...and feel lousy
and watch the grass grow.

44:57.279 --> 44:58.364
Hey.

44:59.448 --> 45:00.824
Hey, come on.

45:00.991 --> 45:02.868
Don't be hard on yourself, yeah?

45:03.035 --> 45:05.120
This is the kind of stuff
nobody gets right.

45:05.287 --> 45:07.247
You do. You always do.

45:07.414 --> 45:09.124
No, no, come on.

45:27.226 --> 45:28.811
Um...

45:31.939 --> 45:34.274
Um, I don't know if we...

45:34.441 --> 45:35.818
Yeah.

45:35.984 --> 45:37.986
- You're right. We shouldn't.
- Yeah.

45:38.153 --> 45:40.280
Yeah.

45:42.783 --> 45:44.326
Fuck.

48:11.515 --> 48:13.475
Huh! Come on.

48:14.768 --> 48:16.728
Are you serious?

48:27.614 --> 48:30.409
Hey, Ms. Smothers!

48:30.576 --> 48:33.036
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah. Um...

48:34.121 --> 48:35.497
I'll come right down.

48:38.166 --> 48:39.418
Shit!

48:40.877 --> 48:42.754
- Hi! Hi!
- Hey, hey.

48:42.921 --> 48:46.216
Uh, I just left something
here, so I was just...

48:46.383 --> 48:49.511
I had a key 'cause earlier
Sean gave me a key...

48:49.678 --> 48:50.989
You're not under arrest,
Miss Smothers.

48:51.013 --> 48:52.764
- Whoa!
- FYI.

48:52.931 --> 48:55.058
I should hope not. Oh!

48:55.225 --> 48:56.768
- All right. No, no.
- No.

48:56.935 --> 48:59.438
- You're very funny.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

48:59.605 --> 49:01.023
Um...

49:01.189 --> 49:02.649
Sean's not here right now.

49:02.816 --> 49:04.985
You know, I was actually
hoping to speak to you.

49:05.152 --> 49:07.154
- Oh!
- Yeah, I went by your house.

49:07.321 --> 49:08.697
Then I went by the school.

49:08.864 --> 49:10.704
Then one of the moms
thought you might be here.

49:10.866 --> 49:13.035
Did they? Okay.
Well, that's...

49:13.201 --> 49:14.620
Was it Stacy?

49:14.786 --> 49:16.455
Can I come in?

49:16.622 --> 49:18.373
- Of course. I would love that.
- Thank you.

49:18.540 --> 49:19.958
Entrez-vous.

49:20.125 --> 49:22.669
You said that Emily's
your best friend.

49:22.836 --> 49:25.047
Yes. Yes, we are.

49:25.213 --> 49:27.299
- Was she depressed?
- No.

49:27.466 --> 49:29.009
No, she had everything.

49:29.176 --> 49:30.636
She had the house
and the job...

49:30.802 --> 49:32.429
And the husband.

49:32.596 --> 49:34.139
I was getting there, yeah.

49:34.306 --> 49:36.266
The neighbors said
they fought a lot.

49:36.433 --> 49:38.644
Well, they had issues. Um...

49:38.810 --> 49:40.479
But they loved
each other intensely.

49:40.646 --> 49:42.814
Oh, what issues
did they have?

49:42.981 --> 49:45.108
The normal issues. They were
stressed about money.

49:45.275 --> 49:47.152
And I think Emily wanted

49:47.319 --> 49:49.112
to slow down
and smell the roses.

49:49.279 --> 49:50.906
She slowed down all right.

49:51.073 --> 49:54.951
I got the autopsy report
right here.

49:55.118 --> 49:56.453
Let's see here.

49:56.620 --> 49:58.997
"Severe liver damage
suggesting heavy alcohol use.

49:59.164 --> 50:02.793
"Track marks along her arms
and between her toes."

50:02.959 --> 50:04.878
I mean, were you aware
of the heroin use?

50:07.798 --> 50:10.175
No, that's, uh...

50:11.593 --> 50:13.929
I'm sorry, I really
have trouble believing that.

50:14.096 --> 50:15.138
I mean...

50:15.305 --> 50:16.890
She liked a very
strong martini, but...

50:17.057 --> 50:21.478
I don't know how she could've
kept that a secret from me,

50:21.645 --> 50:24.231
and especially
from her husband, Sean.

50:24.398 --> 50:26.149
Yeah, you seem
to know Sean pretty well.

50:26.316 --> 50:28.694
I... We've gotten
to know each other

50:28.860 --> 50:31.905
over the last few weeks,
just as friends.

50:32.072 --> 50:33.782
Uh-huh.

50:33.949 --> 50:35.325
I'm guessing

50:35.492 --> 50:37.411
you've never dealt
with law enforcement before.

50:44.751 --> 50:46.253
- Not really, no.
- Mmm.

50:48.714 --> 50:50.090
That's a really nice dress.

50:50.257 --> 50:51.717
Oh, thank you.

50:51.883 --> 50:53.363
Doesn't seem to be
your style, though.

50:53.510 --> 50:55.887
Oh, I'm very versatile,
Detective,

50:56.054 --> 50:57.639
I think you'll find.

50:57.806 --> 51:00.809
I'm really just trying
to help Sean and Nicky

51:00.976 --> 51:02.477
in their time of grief.

51:02.644 --> 51:03.854
Oh, how is Sean's grief?

51:04.020 --> 51:06.606
He's... He is holding up
very well.

51:06.773 --> 51:09.109
As well as can be expected.

51:09.276 --> 51:10.861
Uh-huh.

51:11.027 --> 51:12.904
Is that everything, or...

51:13.071 --> 51:15.615
Let me ask you something.

51:18.326 --> 51:20.370
Were you aware
that he took out

51:20.537 --> 51:23.457
an extra $4 million
life insurance policy

51:23.623 --> 51:25.709
on Emily before
she disappeared?

51:27.544 --> 51:30.464
I was not aware of that, no.

51:30.630 --> 51:33.008
I... Why? How would I?

51:34.843 --> 51:37.137
Okay, all right.

51:37.304 --> 51:39.765
Yeah, I don't...

51:39.931 --> 51:42.350
I'm sorry. What did...

51:44.019 --> 51:46.646
What are you... Are you saying
he had her rubbed out?

51:46.813 --> 51:50.650
He hired a hitman?

51:50.817 --> 51:53.236
I didn't say anything
about him hiring a hitman.

51:53.403 --> 51:54.780
You just did.

51:54.946 --> 51:56.990
Okay, I can see

51:57.157 --> 51:59.242
that you're enjoying yourself,
Detective Summerville.

51:59.409 --> 52:01.077
But if you wanna
grill someone, you should

52:01.244 --> 52:03.246
really speak to Emily's
boss, Dennis Nylon.

52:03.413 --> 52:05.207
He could not be
more suspicious.

52:05.373 --> 52:07.459
That's super interesting
because he contacted us

52:07.626 --> 52:10.086
and he said he thought you knew
more than you were letting on.

52:10.253 --> 52:12.631
Well, he... he sucks.

52:12.798 --> 52:15.175
So...

52:15.342 --> 52:17.761
As long as you're honest
with me, Ms. Smothers,

52:17.928 --> 52:20.889
I swear to you, you have
nothing to worry about, okay?

52:21.056 --> 52:24.226
I'm just following breadcrumbs
wherever they lead.

52:24.392 --> 52:26.394
Okay, you know what?
I'm done for now.

52:26.561 --> 52:28.271
Thanks for your time.

52:28.438 --> 52:31.024
Your theory
doesn't hold water, you know,

52:31.191 --> 52:32.734
because it doesn't explain

52:32.901 --> 52:34.945
the fake plane ticket
or the rental car.

52:35.111 --> 52:36.911
And why would someone
shoot her full of heroin

52:36.947 --> 52:38.323
at a summer camp in Michigan?

52:38.490 --> 52:40.551
There's plenty of good heroin
right here in Connecticut!

52:40.575 --> 52:41.910
I'm told.

52:42.077 --> 52:44.412
Great, good. Okay,
so we have a lot to talk about.

52:44.579 --> 52:46.456
All right, then.
Enjoy the new house.

52:46.623 --> 52:49.209
The worst breadcrumbs
I've ever heard of, you know.

52:49.376 --> 52:51.416
Couldn't fill a Caesar salad
with those breadcrumbs!

53:03.098 --> 53:05.559
Ohh! Ugh!

53:45.015 --> 53:47.976
Why is this
Caesarean salad so crunchy?

53:48.143 --> 53:51.146
It's Caesar salad, baby,
and it's delicious.

53:51.313 --> 53:52.981
What's in it?

53:54.399 --> 53:56.568
- Breadcrumbs.
- Oh.

53:56.735 --> 53:58.153
How was your day at work?

53:58.320 --> 53:59.738
Grim.

53:59.905 --> 54:01.745
Spent most of the day
explaining the difference

54:01.781 --> 54:05.493
between "your" possessive
and "you're" apostrophe R-E

54:05.660 --> 54:07.454
to college juniors.

54:08.538 --> 54:10.749
I can see how that might
drive a man over the edge.

54:10.916 --> 54:12.834
I know, right?

54:13.001 --> 54:14.419
What about you boys?

54:14.586 --> 54:16.226
What'd you guys get up to
today at school?

54:16.379 --> 54:17.797
I saw my mom.

54:20.967 --> 54:22.010
Um...

54:22.177 --> 54:23.595
I understand, Nicky,
that sometimes

54:23.762 --> 54:25.889
we think we see people
that we miss

54:26.056 --> 54:27.724
even if they're gone.

54:27.891 --> 54:29.225
No, I saw her.

54:29.392 --> 54:30.592
She was right outside
the fence

54:30.685 --> 54:32.520
by the kickball yard
at recess.

54:33.605 --> 54:36.232
Well, lots of people
look like someone else.

54:36.399 --> 54:39.110
Nobody looks like Mom!

54:39.277 --> 54:41.237
She told me
to say hi to Stephanie.

54:41.404 --> 54:43.448
Nicky, this is unhealthy.

54:43.615 --> 54:45.784
Miles saw her too.
Right, Miles?

54:46.993 --> 54:48.453
I think I did.

54:48.620 --> 54:51.122
But I don't know.
I was playing tetherball.

54:51.289 --> 54:52.749
Did you two hatch this up?

54:52.916 --> 54:55.144
Is this a game, like when you
smash everything with trucks?

54:55.168 --> 54:56.768
Because you know
what we say about lying.

54:56.795 --> 54:59.381
I'm not lying!
I saw her! Fuck you!

54:59.547 --> 55:01.883
- Hey, Nicky!
- Oopsy!

55:03.843 --> 55:05.261
I'm sorry.

55:14.312 --> 55:16.439
Don't I get a kiss
good night?

55:16.606 --> 55:18.441
Of course you do, sweetie.

55:18.608 --> 55:20.360
Actually, you owe
the oopsy jar a quarter

55:20.527 --> 55:22.445
for earlier, but I...

55:28.368 --> 55:29.786
Good night, sweetie.

55:39.004 --> 55:40.547
Hey.

55:41.631 --> 55:43.299
We should get naked.

55:45.635 --> 55:47.387
What is it?

55:47.554 --> 55:48.722
What's wrong?

55:48.888 --> 55:52.350
I smell her, Sean.
I smell her perfume.

55:52.517 --> 55:54.561
It's all over Nicky
like a ghost.

55:54.728 --> 55:56.229
He probably got
to her perfume bottle

55:56.396 --> 55:57.856
in the medicine cabinet.

55:58.023 --> 55:59.441
He misses her.

55:59.607 --> 56:01.026
Okay? It's just you
being paranoid.

56:01.192 --> 56:03.319
Is it? Because
I found this too.

56:04.612 --> 56:05.864
What's this?

56:06.031 --> 56:07.383
It's the friendship
bracelet I made her.

56:07.407 --> 56:09.534
I'm afraid to say
she would not have kept this.

56:09.701 --> 56:12.203
She hated stuff like this.

56:12.370 --> 56:14.831
She probably gave it to him
right after you gave it to her.

56:14.998 --> 56:17.250
Unless he's telling the truth.

56:17.417 --> 56:19.919
You saw her
with your own eyes.

56:20.086 --> 56:21.463
In her coffin.

56:21.629 --> 56:23.048
There was something off.

56:23.214 --> 56:25.050
They found her
at the bottom of a lake!

56:25.216 --> 56:26.676
You saw her tattoo,

56:26.843 --> 56:29.054
and you saw that ring
that she stole from my mother.

56:30.847 --> 56:32.807
She said your mother
wanted her to have that ring.

56:32.974 --> 56:34.476
She said your
mother insisted.

56:34.642 --> 56:36.770
That's what she told you?

56:36.936 --> 56:39.022
My father gave that ring
to my mother.

56:39.189 --> 56:41.483
It was like the only bit of
jewelry that she ever owned.

56:41.649 --> 56:44.694
I took Emily to London to meet
my mother after we eloped.

56:44.861 --> 56:47.197
It went missing that weekend.

56:47.363 --> 56:50.575
My mother was frantic.
We searched everywhere.

56:50.742 --> 56:53.119
Nothing. We didn't
find a single thing.

56:53.286 --> 56:55.121
<i>My mother was devastated.</i>

56:55.288 --> 56:58.041
<i>So we took our flight
back to New York.</i>

56:58.208 --> 57:00.085
Guess what I found.

57:00.251 --> 57:02.545
What did you find?

57:02.712 --> 57:04.214
No!

57:04.380 --> 57:05.799
No way!

57:05.965 --> 57:08.468
My little Sherlock Holmes.

57:08.635 --> 57:10.345
Mum is gonna
be so relieved.

57:10.512 --> 57:12.055
Oh, come on, baby.

57:12.222 --> 57:15.100
Your mom will take it
to the grave. What a waste.

57:15.266 --> 57:16.601
It's so pretty.

57:16.768 --> 57:17.977
Excuse me.

57:18.144 --> 57:20.688
Not amusing, my darling,
not in the slightest.

57:20.855 --> 57:23.066
I'm not joking
in the slightest...

57:23.233 --> 57:25.235
...my darling.

57:25.401 --> 57:28.321
I took it. I don't have any
intention of giving it back.

57:28.488 --> 57:29.864
Of course
we're gonna give it back.

57:30.031 --> 57:31.407
No.

57:31.574 --> 57:34.202
We'll tell her it just slipped
into your purse by accident,

57:34.369 --> 57:36.371
and we've only
found it now.

57:36.538 --> 57:38.206
But if you tell her
that I found it,

57:38.373 --> 57:40.208
then I have to tell her
that I stole it.

57:40.375 --> 57:42.377
And what do you think
will be worse for her?

57:42.544 --> 57:44.420
Thinking that
she lost her ring,

57:44.587 --> 57:47.298
or thinking that her son
married a thief?

57:47.465 --> 57:48.800
- Baby...
- Hey.

57:48.967 --> 57:51.553
You choose, her or me?

57:54.222 --> 57:56.015
Meet me in the bathroom
in 20 seconds.

57:56.182 --> 57:57.725
Knock twice.

58:23.835 --> 58:26.880
<i>Nine months later,
Nicky was born.</i>

58:27.046 --> 58:29.048
<i>How could you stay with her?</i>

58:29.215 --> 58:31.217
I was spellbound.

58:31.384 --> 58:33.928
She was the only woman
I could never figure out fully.

58:34.095 --> 58:36.014
And as a young,
arrogant writer,

58:36.181 --> 58:38.266
I could never live up
to what she expected of me.

58:38.433 --> 58:40.101
I was always
looking over my shoulder.

58:40.268 --> 58:41.811
I could hardly sleep.

58:42.937 --> 58:44.397
But with you, it's different.

58:44.564 --> 58:46.024
I sleep like a log.

58:46.191 --> 58:47.671
That's what every woman
wants to hear.

58:47.734 --> 58:49.027
You know what I mean.

58:49.194 --> 58:50.904
You understand me,
you see me.

58:51.070 --> 58:53.239
You've rebuilt me,
Stephanie.

58:53.406 --> 58:55.533
I've even started
writing again.

58:55.700 --> 58:57.702
First couple of chapters,

58:57.869 --> 58:59.704
but it's a start.

59:00.872 --> 59:02.415
Oh.

59:03.499 --> 59:04.876
That's wonderful.

59:05.043 --> 59:06.669
You took a broken man

59:06.836 --> 59:08.630
and you pieced him
back together again.

59:09.714 --> 59:11.883
You're unlike any other
woman I've ever met.

59:13.676 --> 59:15.136
Move in with me.

59:16.221 --> 59:17.347
Sean.

59:17.513 --> 59:19.641
No, it's too soon.
What will people think?

59:19.807 --> 59:21.184
They're already thinking it.

59:21.351 --> 59:23.603
And I'm tired of lying.
I'm tired of pretending.

59:23.770 --> 59:25.396
I want to be this man.

59:25.563 --> 59:27.690
The man I am with you.

59:27.857 --> 59:29.651
I don't do threesomes.

59:29.817 --> 59:32.612
I want to say that. I'll just
get that out in the open.

59:32.779 --> 59:34.364
What are you talking about?

59:34.530 --> 59:35.990
Your TA?

59:36.157 --> 59:39.285
Emily told me
about your little moment.

59:39.452 --> 59:40.870
- That's what she told you?
- Yes.

59:41.037 --> 59:44.165
Stephanie, listen.
Emily was a pathological liar.

59:44.332 --> 59:46.960
That never happened, okay?

59:47.126 --> 59:48.920
Why did you take out
a $4 million

59:49.087 --> 59:50.797
insurance policy on her?

59:50.964 --> 59:53.549
My gosh. Those cops really did
a number on you, didn't they?

59:53.716 --> 59:56.636
- I'm being serious.
- It was because of you.

59:56.803 --> 59:58.346
When Emily found out
that you had been

59:58.513 --> 01:00:00.807
living off your husband's
insurance money,

01:00:00.974 --> 01:00:03.184
she thought she and I
needed to get policies

01:00:03.351 --> 01:00:05.103
out for Nicky's sake.

01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:07.350
It's probably the most
responsible thing we ever did.

01:00:07.397 --> 01:00:09.899
Thanks to you.

01:00:11.234 --> 01:00:12.610
Move in with me.

01:00:12.777 --> 01:00:15.321
We can start a whole new,
wonderful life together.

01:00:15.488 --> 01:00:17.407
Just you, me and the boys.

01:00:18.866 --> 01:00:21.786
Please, say yes.

01:00:23.579 --> 01:00:27.041
I love you,
Stephanie Smothers.

01:00:27.208 --> 01:00:29.544
I love you too.

01:00:48.479 --> 01:00:50.023
Hmm...

01:01:48.039 --> 01:01:50.249
<i>Hi, moms. Stephanie here.</i>

01:01:50.416 --> 01:01:51.667
<i>I'm gonna do something</i>

01:01:51.834 --> 01:01:53.002
<i>a little different today.</i>

01:01:53.169 --> 01:01:54.337
<i>I normally avoid any talk</i>

01:01:54.504 --> 01:01:55.671
<i>of religion on the vlog.</i>

01:01:55.838 --> 01:01:56.881
<i>I don't wanna offend any</i>

01:01:57.048 --> 01:01:58.216
<i>non-denominational moms.</i>

01:01:58.383 --> 01:01:59.759
<i>But I do think that we live on</i>

01:01:59.926 --> 01:02:01.511
<i>after we die, so...</i>

01:02:03.054 --> 01:02:06.766
<i>Emily, if you are out there,</i>

01:02:06.933 --> 01:02:09.060
<i>and you can hear me
right now,</i>

01:02:09.227 --> 01:02:11.312
<i>no one could ever replace you.</i>

01:02:11.479 --> 01:02:14.023
<i>And you'll always be
Nicky's mom.</i>

01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:16.692
<i>I can't take your place.</i>

01:02:16.859 --> 01:02:21.030
<i>I can just try to love
the people that you love</i>

01:02:21.197 --> 01:02:23.241
<i>and try to make
their lives better.</i>

01:02:23.408 --> 01:02:25.618
<i>I think that's what
you would want.</i>

01:02:30.039 --> 01:02:32.750
Okay, guys, it's getting
too rough back there.

01:02:32.917 --> 01:02:34.377
I murdered you!

01:02:34.544 --> 01:02:37.130
Not me.
I came back to life.

01:02:37.296 --> 01:02:38.798
Like your mom!

01:02:38.965 --> 01:02:40.609
Okay, the dolls
are going in your backpacks

01:02:40.633 --> 01:02:42.301
or they're going
in the trash, I mean it.

01:02:42.468 --> 01:02:44.762
Mom, they're
not dolls! God!

01:02:44.929 --> 01:02:48.141
Stephanie, my mom told me
to give you this.

01:02:49.434 --> 01:02:50.977
Mom!

01:02:58.067 --> 01:02:59.861
Damn! Are you
trying to kill us?

01:03:19.297 --> 01:03:20.465
Hello?

01:03:20.631 --> 01:03:22.671
<i>Hi, I'm calling from United
Timeshare International.</i>

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.177
Yep, I...

01:03:24.343 --> 01:03:26.303
<i>We'd like to offer you
a free trip to the Bahamas.</i>

01:03:26.387 --> 01:03:27.889
<i>All you have to do
is come down to...</i>

01:03:28.055 --> 01:03:30.099
I don't want that. I'm sorry.
I... Have a nice day.

01:03:30.266 --> 01:03:31.767
I don't want that.
I don't care.

01:03:31.934 --> 01:03:33.895
Oh, my God.

01:03:37.773 --> 01:03:39.442
Hi, I'm sure you
have a job to do.

01:03:39.609 --> 01:03:41.402
- I don't need a free trip...
<i>- Hi.</i>

01:03:44.197 --> 01:03:45.781
<i>Brotherfucker.</i>

01:03:48.409 --> 01:03:50.745
- Emily?
<i>- No, no, Emily's dead.</i>

01:03:50.912 --> 01:03:53.372
<i>Oh, no, have you
forgotten already?</i>

01:03:53.539 --> 01:03:55.124
- Where are you?
<i>- I'm in heaven.</i>

01:03:55.291 --> 01:03:57.001
<i>Watching over you.</i>

01:03:57.168 --> 01:03:59.086
<i>Nice blouse, by the way.</i>

01:04:01.339 --> 01:04:02.840
Why are you doing this?

01:04:03.007 --> 01:04:04.717
<i>How do you know
it's just me doing it?</i>

01:04:04.884 --> 01:04:07.303
<i>Hey, hey, hey,
kiss Sean for me,</i>

01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:09.597
<i>four million times.</i>

01:04:14.769 --> 01:04:15.811
Oh, hey.

01:04:15.978 --> 01:04:17.772
Are you trying
to Diabolique me?

01:04:17.939 --> 01:04:19.148
What are you
talking about?

01:04:19.315 --> 01:04:20.483
'Diabolique', you know?

01:04:20.650 --> 01:04:22.443
The French movie
about the guy

01:04:22.610 --> 01:04:24.421
whose wife and mistress,
they're trying to kill him.

01:04:24.445 --> 01:04:26.256
But I don't have
a $4 million insurance policy.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:27.490
Stephanie...

01:04:27.657 --> 01:04:29.450
If you and Emily
have some kind of plan...

01:04:29.617 --> 01:04:31.303
- Stephanie, relax.
- ...please just call it off.

01:04:31.327 --> 01:04:33.829
- I'm really not the one.
- Just breathe, please.

01:04:33.996 --> 01:04:36.123
Nicky's getting to you.
Emily is dead.

01:04:36.290 --> 01:04:37.625
She called me.

01:04:38.709 --> 01:04:40.962
- What?
- She called me today.

01:04:41.128 --> 01:04:42.523
I have a friend
in the psychology department.

01:04:42.547 --> 01:04:43.589
I'll give him a call.

01:04:43.756 --> 01:04:45.216
Hey, handsome,
you got time...

01:04:45.383 --> 01:04:48.261
I am sorry. I didn't know
you were in a meeting.

01:04:48.427 --> 01:04:51.138
- Beth, this is Stephanie.
- Nice to meet you.

01:04:51.305 --> 01:04:52.890
Nice to meet you.

01:04:53.057 --> 01:04:54.934
I was just wondering
if you needed

01:04:55.101 --> 01:04:56.978
to use the SMART board,
'cause it's broken.

01:04:57.144 --> 01:04:59.730
- I can live without it.
- All right.

01:04:59.897 --> 01:05:01.440
All right.

01:05:02.942 --> 01:05:05.736
- She seems nice.
- Stephanie, go home.

01:05:05.903 --> 01:05:07.663
Emily had some Xanax
in the medicine cabinet.

01:05:07.822 --> 01:05:09.115
Take one. Take two.

01:05:09.282 --> 01:05:11.534
Yeah. Maybe she has some
heroin lying around. Hmm?

01:05:11.701 --> 01:05:14.662
This is all just grief.
Just stages of grief.

01:05:14.829 --> 01:05:16.789
I'm sorry, you're right.

01:05:16.956 --> 01:05:19.458
I'm so overwhelmed and I...

01:05:19.625 --> 01:05:21.961
I'm sorry.

01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:29.343
<i>Oh, baby, you just
need someone to love you.</i>

01:05:30.511 --> 01:05:33.639
I have you.
All you need is a good friend.

01:05:33.806 --> 01:05:35.766
Come on.
Don't you miss sex?

01:05:35.933 --> 01:05:38.436
Having a man fuck you
on top of a washing machine?

01:05:38.603 --> 01:05:41.439
Barely remember
what it's like.

01:05:41.606 --> 01:05:42.732
Why are you
such a masochist?

01:05:42.898 --> 01:05:44.942
You could have a man
in your bed anytime you want.

01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:47.486
- I had a man. I ruined that.
- What does that mean?

01:05:47.653 --> 01:05:49.780
- Come on. What does that mean?
- No...

01:05:49.947 --> 01:05:51.907
If you can't tell me,
you can't tell anyone.

01:05:52.074 --> 01:05:53.492
I'm your best friend.

01:06:13.387 --> 01:06:15.389
Let's go see Daddy.

01:06:19.268 --> 01:06:20.478
<i>I just want the truth.</i>

01:06:20.645 --> 01:06:21.979
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

01:06:22.146 --> 01:06:24.440
About Miles and Chris.

01:06:24.607 --> 01:06:27.151
Chris? My brother, Chris?

01:06:27.318 --> 01:06:29.070
- I don't...
- Yeah, your brother.

01:06:29.236 --> 01:06:30.946
And you certainly
don't act like it.

01:06:31.113 --> 01:06:34.492
Sometimes it's more like
you guys are lovers, right?

01:06:36.535 --> 01:06:38.371
That's disgusting. That's...

01:06:38.537 --> 01:06:40.414
Is Miles mine or not?

01:06:42.291 --> 01:06:43.501
Oh, my God!

01:06:43.668 --> 01:06:45.711
Are you listening
to yourself?

01:06:45.878 --> 01:06:47.171
You sound ridiculous.

01:06:47.338 --> 01:06:48.881
Yeah.

01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:58.099
Davis! Davis!

01:06:58.265 --> 01:06:59.600
Where are you going?

01:06:59.767 --> 01:07:01.310
Da... Where are you going?
Davis?

01:07:01.477 --> 01:07:02.853
Steph, it's all right.
Don't worry.

01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:04.563
We're just gonna
go for a drive.

01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:07.066
Have a little talk.
Man to man. No problem.

01:07:27.545 --> 01:07:29.463
<i>It's my fault.</i>

01:07:31.382 --> 01:07:32.967
I'm the reason
they're both dead.

01:07:33.134 --> 01:07:34.510
No.

01:07:34.677 --> 01:07:36.762
Hey, don't do that.

01:07:36.929 --> 01:07:38.764
People... people
do terrible things

01:07:38.931 --> 01:07:40.391
for their own
fucked-up reasons.

01:07:40.558 --> 01:07:42.393
- That's on them, not on you.
- Yeah.

01:07:44.937 --> 01:07:46.856
I miss him.

01:07:47.022 --> 01:07:48.566
Which one?

01:07:50.317 --> 01:07:51.902
Both.

01:07:52.987 --> 01:07:56.198
I'm lonely.

01:07:57.324 --> 01:07:59.084
I think loneliness
probably kills more people

01:07:59.118 --> 01:08:00.661
than cancer.

01:08:03.456 --> 01:08:05.916
Hey, come here.

01:08:07.334 --> 01:08:09.003
Come here.

01:08:24.852 --> 01:08:27.772
You're okay.
Want to order pizza?

01:08:32.484 --> 01:08:35.488
Oh, God. God,
I'm so embarrassed.

01:08:35.654 --> 01:08:40.242
Oh, because of that?
No, hey. It's all good, baby.

01:08:40.408 --> 01:08:42.828
It's all good.
Just another Tuesday.

01:09:25.162 --> 01:09:26.872
<i>Go away.</i>

01:09:27.038 --> 01:09:29.124
Diana Hyland?

01:09:29.291 --> 01:09:31.585
Did you paint this?

01:09:43.346 --> 01:09:44.932
Where on Earth
did you find it?

01:09:45.099 --> 01:09:48.810
I should start by giving you
some unfortunate news. Um...

01:09:48.978 --> 01:09:50.520
Emily's dead.

01:09:50.688 --> 01:09:52.481
My condolences.

01:09:52.648 --> 01:09:54.316
Who the fuck is Emily?

01:09:54.483 --> 01:09:56.735
The girl in the painting.

01:10:00.072 --> 01:10:02.283
Good. Her name's not Emily.

01:10:02.449 --> 01:10:03.617
Her name's Claudia.

01:10:03.784 --> 01:10:07.079
Rest in peace, asshole.

01:10:07.246 --> 01:10:09.290
So, not a pleasant memory
for you, then?

01:10:09.456 --> 01:10:11.917
No, opposite.
She was amazing.

01:10:12.084 --> 01:10:15.004
I mean, she was the best
that I ever had.

01:10:15.170 --> 01:10:16.547
I was selling paintings.

01:10:16.714 --> 01:10:18.090
You know,
it was the first time

01:10:18.257 --> 01:10:20.009
in my career
that I had any buzz.

01:10:20.175 --> 01:10:22.094
She walked
into my gallery.

01:10:22.261 --> 01:10:24.513
A real fucking muse
just right out of thin air.

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:27.641
- What happened?
- She was all I could paint.

01:10:28.851 --> 01:10:31.478
I memorized
every inch of her body.

01:10:31.645 --> 01:10:33.022
My dealer fucking hated it.

01:10:33.188 --> 01:10:34.690
And the art critics
fucking hated it.

01:10:34.857 --> 01:10:37.651
They called me a knockoff,
a dyke Mapplethorpe.

01:10:37.818 --> 01:10:41.030
Anyway, I blew my whole career
painting that con artist.

01:10:41.196 --> 01:10:43.282
Now all I paint
are these goddamn knives,

01:10:43.449 --> 01:10:45.784
which are pretty good, but
nobody wants to buy this shit.

01:10:45.951 --> 01:10:49.204
Oh, what? They're so good.
People are just jealous.

01:10:52.625 --> 01:10:54.460
I haven't had a drink
in 42 days.

01:10:54.627 --> 01:10:57.588
- Oh, don't...
- Might as well celebrate.

01:10:57.755 --> 01:11:00.174
Mmm, well, cheers.

01:11:02.843 --> 01:11:05.804
I gave her my heart
and I gave her my soul.

01:11:05.971 --> 01:11:09.725
I paid for her
to go to college.

01:11:09.892 --> 01:11:11.310
I paid off her debts.

01:11:11.477 --> 01:11:13.270
Did you ever
see any heroin use?

01:11:13.437 --> 01:11:15.439
No. No way, her?

01:11:15.606 --> 01:11:16.941
No, she didn't touch it.

01:11:17.107 --> 01:11:18.317
Shit.

01:11:18.484 --> 01:11:21.987
She never let me paint
her face except for this one.

01:11:22.154 --> 01:11:24.907
I've never seen
such a beautiful girl

01:11:25.074 --> 01:11:26.659
want to be so invisible

01:11:26.825 --> 01:11:28.702
or just completely vanish.

01:11:28.869 --> 01:11:32.039
But you know what,
it takes money to vanish.

01:11:32.206 --> 01:11:36.293
And so she took everything
that she could from me.

01:11:37.586 --> 01:11:39.546
You know
how I would paint you?

01:11:41.215 --> 01:11:43.300
Beatific.

01:11:43.467 --> 01:11:45.678
Like... like a fucking saint.

01:11:45.844 --> 01:11:47.846
I get that a lot.

01:11:48.013 --> 01:11:51.433
You should embrace it.
People love saints.

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:53.769
Yeah. After they're dead.

01:11:55.479 --> 01:11:57.523
Okay. What do you know
about her? How did she die?

01:11:57.690 --> 01:11:59.274
In a lake.

01:11:59.441 --> 01:12:01.068
On heroin.

01:12:04.113 --> 01:12:06.198
Well, you don't believe that
or you wouldn't be here.

01:12:06.365 --> 01:12:09.451
She didn't ever mention
Michigan, did she?

01:12:09.618 --> 01:12:11.161
Huh.

01:12:16.291 --> 01:12:19.503
That is the only thing
that she ever left here.

01:12:19.670 --> 01:12:21.922
She said she had it
since she was a kid.

01:12:25.009 --> 01:12:27.886
I warn you, you go
poking around in her past,

01:12:28.053 --> 01:12:30.347
you're gonna find
some shit that is terrifying.

01:12:30.514 --> 01:12:33.934
She was not a normal person
like you or me.

01:12:34.101 --> 01:12:35.978
Sean, it's Stephanie...

01:12:36.145 --> 01:12:37.688
I thought about
what you said.

01:12:37.855 --> 01:12:40.357
And you're right.
These are just stages of grief.

01:12:40.524 --> 01:12:42.544
This experience has been
so stressful for both of us,

01:12:42.568 --> 01:12:44.236
I'm gonna take
a couple of days to myself.

01:12:44.403 --> 01:12:45.779
I'll have Sona pick up the boys,

01:12:45.946 --> 01:12:47.466
and they can stay
at her house tonight.

01:12:47.531 --> 01:12:49.074
You should take
some time too.

01:12:49.241 --> 01:12:50.826
There's ham stew
in the freezer.

01:12:50.993 --> 01:12:52.713
Five minutes in the microwave.
Lots of love.

01:12:54.496 --> 01:12:56.290
Yeah,
we've been saving young souls

01:12:56.457 --> 01:12:58.042
going on 50 years now.

01:12:58.208 --> 01:13:00.044
Not Bobby and me personally.

01:13:00.210 --> 01:13:01.712
Well, it seems just perfect!

01:13:01.879 --> 01:13:03.279
And my son's
practically a porpoise,

01:13:03.422 --> 01:13:05.302
so I know he's gonna love
swimming in that pond.

01:13:05.424 --> 01:13:06.759
Oh, that's Squaw Lake!

01:13:06.925 --> 01:13:08.927
The kids all joke
that it's holy water.

01:13:09.094 --> 01:13:10.679
Any fish
you pull out of there

01:13:10.846 --> 01:13:12.556
is guaranteed
to feed a multitude.

01:13:12.723 --> 01:13:15.225
Oh! Oh. That's so funny.

01:13:15.392 --> 01:13:19.646
Um... have you guys
got any old photo albums

01:13:19.813 --> 01:13:21.523
or a yearbook I could look at?

01:13:21.690 --> 01:13:23.293
I always feel like
there's no better review

01:13:23.317 --> 01:13:24.985
of a place than the faces
of the campers.

01:13:25.152 --> 01:13:27.446
Oh, heck, yeah. We got a ton
of 'em down in the basement.

01:13:27.613 --> 01:13:28.906
You'll see nothing but smiles.

01:13:51.845 --> 01:13:54.139
Hope and Faith.

01:13:56.767 --> 01:13:59.978
Hi. I'm looking
for the McLanden Foundation.

01:14:00.145 --> 01:14:02.439
Is this Margaret McLanden?

01:14:02.606 --> 01:14:03.899
<i>Who's this?</i>

01:14:04.066 --> 01:14:06.819
Yeah. Hi, there. My name's
Maryanne Chelkowsky.

01:14:06.985 --> 01:14:08.987
I'm the director
of the Squaw Lake Bible Camp.

01:14:09.154 --> 01:14:10.531
<i>What do you want?</i>

01:14:10.697 --> 01:14:13.033
Well, we are putting together
the 50th anniversary

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:14.827
edition of our camp gazette.

01:14:14.993 --> 01:14:16.787
We're trying to track down
some star alumni.

01:14:16.954 --> 01:14:19.957
<i>Are you any relation to
Hope and Faith McLanden?</i>

01:14:20.124 --> 01:14:22.042
<i>- Hello?
- Bruce, it's that camp.</i>

01:14:22.209 --> 01:14:24.211
<i>The girls must have done
something again and...</i>

01:14:24.378 --> 01:14:25.838
<i>The girls
are long gone, Mrs. M.</i>

01:14:26.004 --> 01:14:27.464
<i>You just go on back
to your chair.</i>

01:14:27.631 --> 01:14:29.842
<i>But it's filthy there,
Bruce. I've asked you a...</i>

01:14:30.008 --> 01:14:31.426
Gotcha.

01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:16.555
Take your time, Bruce.

01:15:38.577 --> 01:15:40.287
Mrs. McLanden?

01:15:41.496 --> 01:15:43.916
Hi, I'm Gloria
from the cleaning service.

01:15:44.082 --> 01:15:45.542
- Who?
- Didn't Bruce tell you?

01:15:45.709 --> 01:15:48.003
I'm supposed to clean the
entire place until you could eat

01:15:48.170 --> 01:15:49.922
a four-course meal
off the floor.

01:15:50.088 --> 01:15:51.298
Did I get the date...

01:15:51.465 --> 01:15:52.883
Shoot!

01:15:56.845 --> 01:15:59.223
Start in my
upstairs bathroom.

01:16:04.478 --> 01:16:06.438
It's not lying
if I'm actually cleaning.

01:16:24.248 --> 01:16:26.917
Bruce!
The fire's dying!

01:16:28.210 --> 01:16:29.753
Bruce!

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:45.269
I couldn't help noticing

01:16:45.435 --> 01:16:47.521
that lovely picture
of your daughters.

01:16:47.688 --> 01:16:50.232
Where... where's Bruce?

01:16:50.399 --> 01:16:52.401
- Bruce!
- Oh, um...

01:16:52.567 --> 01:16:55.028
Bruce had to go out. Um...

01:16:55.195 --> 01:16:58.407
So your daughter, Faith...

01:16:58.573 --> 01:16:59.992
She had some trouble,
I gather?

01:17:00.158 --> 01:17:02.452
Troubles!

01:17:02.619 --> 01:17:05.247
Troubles would've
been a vacation.

01:17:06.498 --> 01:17:09.251
That child came
straight from hell.

01:17:09.418 --> 01:17:12.045
That's a very strong
statement for a mother.

01:17:12.212 --> 01:17:14.673
- Are you a mother?
- Yes.

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:16.550
I love every minute of it.

01:17:16.717 --> 01:17:18.510
Aww.

01:17:18.677 --> 01:17:20.512
Then you must have
brain damage.

01:17:20.679 --> 01:17:22.556
It's a thankless business.

01:17:22.723 --> 01:17:24.975
And some children
are just born rotten.

01:17:25.142 --> 01:17:27.477
They don't need a parent.

01:17:27.644 --> 01:17:29.146
They need an exorcist.

01:17:29.313 --> 01:17:31.315
My husband understood that.

01:17:31.481 --> 01:17:33.984
Okay, now, just... Wait.

01:17:34.151 --> 01:17:35.444
Don't. Don't tell Bruce!

01:17:35.610 --> 01:17:37.487
- No.
- Bingo!

01:17:37.654 --> 01:17:40.741
It's unseemly,
the way that man polices me.

01:17:40.907 --> 01:17:42.534
Would you like
some sherry?

01:17:42.701 --> 01:17:44.369
Oh, no, thank you.
You're very sweet.

01:17:44.536 --> 01:17:46.288
Wait, that's...

01:17:46.455 --> 01:17:48.915
That's not sherry.
That's the gin.

01:17:49.082 --> 01:17:50.584
Where's the sherry?

01:17:50.751 --> 01:17:52.377
Must be behind
the Sylvia Plath.

01:17:52.544 --> 01:17:54.171
What ever happened
to Faith?

01:17:54.338 --> 01:17:56.256
Oh, everything. Everything.

01:17:56.423 --> 01:17:59.551
We spent so much money
on her rehab.

01:17:59.718 --> 01:18:02.012
Hope tried to help
take care of her

01:18:02.179 --> 01:18:03.555
and get her...

01:18:03.722 --> 01:18:05.557
...off that stuff.

01:18:05.724 --> 01:18:07.934
Of course, Hope's a born
liar with terrible posture.

01:18:08.101 --> 01:18:10.270
Uh, Mrs. McLanden?

01:18:10.437 --> 01:18:13.940
Do you... do you know
the person in this photograph?

01:18:16.651 --> 01:18:19.321
That's Faith. That's Faith!

01:18:19.488 --> 01:18:21.073
Now, why are you...
Did she send you?

01:18:21.239 --> 01:18:23.051
- No, I'm not even sure...
- Are you the police?

01:18:23.075 --> 01:18:24.409
No, I'm just ask...

01:18:24.576 --> 01:18:26.244
I have told you people
a thousand times.

01:18:26.411 --> 01:18:29.289
My memory is not good anymore.
It will not stand up in court.

01:18:29.456 --> 01:18:31.041
The night of that fire,

01:18:31.208 --> 01:18:32.876
my husband and I
were estranged.

01:18:33.043 --> 01:18:34.603
We lived in separate wings
of the house.

01:18:34.753 --> 01:18:36.922
The fire that burned down
the west wing?

01:18:37.089 --> 01:18:39.299
Are you an insurance agent?

01:18:40.384 --> 01:18:42.886
- Yes.
- Oh!

01:18:43.053 --> 01:18:45.722
Oh, good! Oh, good, good.

01:18:45.889 --> 01:18:48.558
Oh, Bruce and I have been
waiting for the insurance money.

01:18:48.725 --> 01:18:52.229
Of course, you assholes
had that clause about arson.

01:18:52.396 --> 01:18:54.481
- Right, arson. Yeah.
- Vultures.

01:18:54.648 --> 01:18:56.483
Here's to being house poor!

01:18:56.650 --> 01:18:58.568
You ain't supposed
to be drinking, Mrs. M.

01:18:58.735 --> 01:19:00.404
- Who are you?
- Well, uh...

01:19:00.570 --> 01:19:02.656
Thank you so much
for your time, Mrs. McLanden.

01:19:02.823 --> 01:19:05.534
I will get you that
faux Givenchy suit in ivory

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:07.369
and the scarf in taupe.

01:19:07.536 --> 01:19:10.622
I will put a rush on it!
Thank you for your order!

01:19:10.789 --> 01:19:12.582
Shit.

01:19:49.411 --> 01:19:51.037
Where do you think
you're going?

01:19:51.204 --> 01:19:52.664
Uh...

01:19:52.831 --> 01:19:55.876
I wanted to order
the navy blazer.

01:19:56.042 --> 01:19:57.669
Extra large.

01:19:57.836 --> 01:19:59.796
Great.

01:20:04.593 --> 01:20:06.386
Hello.

01:20:06.553 --> 01:20:08.013
What do you want, cupcake?

01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:09.973
I'm looking for
all the Wayne County

01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:12.642
arson-related news items
for the last 20 years.

01:20:22.068 --> 01:20:24.154
<i>Hi, moms, Stephanie here.</i>

01:20:24.321 --> 01:20:26.573
<i>I'm coming to you
from Michigan.</i>

01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:29.159
<i>Special on-the-road edition.</i>

01:20:30.785 --> 01:20:32.829
<i>As many of you know,</i>

01:20:32.996 --> 01:20:34.456
<i>I was struggling
to find closure</i>

01:20:34.623 --> 01:20:36.374
<i>surrounding the death
of my best friend.</i>

01:20:36.541 --> 01:20:39.419
<i>So I drove up to the lake
where she drowned</i>

01:20:39.586 --> 01:20:41.296
<i>to see if I could...</i>

01:20:41.463 --> 01:20:43.131
<i>...dredge something up.</i>

01:20:43.298 --> 01:20:44.716
Oh, shit.

01:20:44.883 --> 01:20:46.593
Well, it turns out
this is the site

01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:48.803
of many a canoe race at

01:20:48.970 --> 01:20:50.388
<i>the Squaw Lake Bible Camp.</i>

01:20:50.555 --> 01:20:52.474
<i>I had to dig through
a bunch of camp journals,</i>

01:20:52.641 --> 01:20:55.727
<i>and I found a photo of Emily,</i>

01:20:55.894 --> 01:20:57.979
<i>whose middle name is Claudia.</i>

01:20:58.146 --> 01:20:59.731
<i>Not pretty. I didn't know that.</i>

01:20:59.898 --> 01:21:03.276
You crazy fucking bitch.

01:21:03.443 --> 01:21:05.529
It's like looking at
an angel, isn't it, moms?

01:21:05.695 --> 01:21:07.239
Brotherfucker.

01:21:07.405 --> 01:21:09.282
And it gave me
the closure I needed.

01:21:09.449 --> 01:21:11.701
<i>I feel closer to Emily
than I've ever felt.</i>

01:21:11.868 --> 01:21:13.411
<i>Almost like a twin.</i>

01:21:13.578 --> 01:21:15.497
Emily, wherever you are...

01:21:17.290 --> 01:21:20.502
...I hope that
you're listening,

01:21:20.669 --> 01:21:22.796
and you gotta have faith.

01:21:23.964 --> 01:21:26.758
Brotherfucker!

01:21:53.952 --> 01:21:55.453
Mom's home!

01:21:55.620 --> 01:21:57.247
Oh, Smoochie-smooch?

01:21:57.414 --> 01:21:58.790
Oh, my goodness!

01:21:58.957 --> 01:22:00.292
Smooch, I missed
you so much!

01:22:00.458 --> 01:22:02.168
Where were you?

01:22:02.335 --> 01:22:04.212
And why did we have to sleep
at Hector's house?

01:22:04.379 --> 01:22:07.591
- He pees the bed!
- Oh! Hector's the worst!

01:22:07.757 --> 01:22:09.277
They could've stayed
with me, you know.

01:22:10.677 --> 01:22:12.596
I thought we all
needed a breather.

01:22:12.762 --> 01:22:14.598
Now I feel like
a million bucks.

01:22:14.764 --> 01:22:16.433
Maybe even four.

01:22:19.477 --> 01:22:21.146
Hi, my name's Beth.

01:22:21.313 --> 01:22:23.193
I'm calling on behalf of
my boss, Sean Townsend,

01:22:23.315 --> 01:22:24.795
about his wife,
Emily Nelson's policy.

01:22:24.858 --> 01:22:30.238
The number is CT7602258001.

01:22:30.405 --> 01:22:32.073
Can you tell me the name
of the agent

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:33.520
who handles
that account, please?

01:22:33.617 --> 01:22:35.452
<i>Dear Miss Prager,
my name is Bruce Hargrave.</i>

01:22:35.619 --> 01:22:37.430
<i>I'm writing to you about
a case you're handling</i>

01:22:37.454 --> 01:22:38.955
<i>for Emily Nelson,
recently deceased.</i>

01:22:39.122 --> 01:22:40.707
<i>I have been the caretaker</i>

01:22:40.874 --> 01:22:42.274
<i>of her family estate
for many years.</i>

01:22:42.334 --> 01:22:43.793
<i>What I have to say
will sound crazy,</i>

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:45.840
<i>but years ago, my employer
died in a house fire.</i>

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:47.356
<i>His teen daughters,
Hope and Faith McLanden,</i>

01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:48.715
<i>disappeared without a trace.</i>

01:22:48.882 --> 01:22:50.042
<i>I'm attaching an old photo...</i>

01:22:50.091 --> 01:22:51.509
Hi, this is Sean Townsend.

01:22:51.676 --> 01:22:53.511
I was meant to meet
Billy Kent for lunch.

01:22:54.971 --> 01:22:56.222
What do you mean?

01:22:56.389 --> 01:22:59.017
You guys called two days ago
to organize this.

01:23:03.229 --> 01:23:05.982
No, never mind.
I'll call him back.

01:23:06.149 --> 01:23:07.692
Boo.

01:23:12.906 --> 01:23:14.282
Oh, come on, you dumb shit.

01:23:14.449 --> 01:23:15.801
We've spent
every anniversary here.

01:23:15.825 --> 01:23:17.410
How could you not
put it together?

01:23:17.577 --> 01:23:20.497
- Emily, why?
- I have 4 million reasons why.

01:23:20.664 --> 01:23:23.625
- How could you do this to Nicky?
- I did this for Nicky.

01:23:23.792 --> 01:23:25.669
I hated that job.
I never got to see him.

01:23:25.835 --> 01:23:27.835
It's not like we could
live off your faculty buffet

01:23:27.879 --> 01:23:29.339
the rest of our lives,
could we?

01:23:29.506 --> 01:23:31.299
I grieved your death.

01:23:31.466 --> 01:23:33.051
I understand.

01:23:33.218 --> 01:23:34.636
You're not alone.

01:23:34.803 --> 01:23:37.055
They say that 90% of people
who lose their spouse

01:23:37.222 --> 01:23:38.991
end up sleeping with
their spouse's best friend

01:23:39.015 --> 01:23:40.725
after their funeral, actually.

01:23:40.892 --> 01:23:42.018
Really?

01:23:42.185 --> 01:23:45.146
No, I just made that up,
you fucking dick.

01:23:45.313 --> 01:23:46.856
That's how you grieve?

01:23:47.023 --> 01:23:48.400
Balls deep
in my best friend?

01:23:48.566 --> 01:23:49.943
You could've
told me something.

01:23:50.110 --> 01:23:52.030
Except you can't keep
a secret, even in the dark.

01:23:52.195 --> 01:23:54.572
- Anything.
- You almost ruined everything.

01:23:56.408 --> 01:23:59.077
I had to lay low until the
insurance money came through.

01:23:59.244 --> 01:24:01.830
And so why didn't
you stay low? Hmm?

01:24:01.996 --> 01:24:04.791
- Instead you terrorized our son.
- I didn't terrorize him.

01:24:04.958 --> 01:24:06.626
You made me think
that he had gone insane

01:24:06.793 --> 01:24:07.961
as well as Stephanie.

01:24:08.128 --> 01:24:10.338
I missed him too much.

01:24:10.505 --> 01:24:12.257
He's my little dude.

01:24:12.424 --> 01:24:14.718
You know how much
I love that kid.

01:24:16.594 --> 01:24:18.054
Well, the clock is ticking now.

01:24:18.221 --> 01:24:19.973
Nancy Drew knows too much.

01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:22.100
If she fucks up my insurance
money coming through,

01:24:22.142 --> 01:24:23.685
I'm taking you
down with me.

01:24:23.852 --> 01:24:25.395
You're taking me
down with you?

01:24:25.562 --> 01:24:27.039
Well, of course,
this was all your plan.

01:24:27.063 --> 01:24:28.982
My plan?
I had nothing to do with it...

01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:30.942
Why are you
playing dumb now?

01:24:31.109 --> 01:24:32.610
...you twisted fucking psycho.

01:24:32.777 --> 01:24:34.404
I don't know where...

01:24:36.698 --> 01:24:39.743
What were you saying about
me being a fucking psycho?

01:24:39.909 --> 01:24:43.455
- Do you love her?
- No. It was just sex.

01:24:43.621 --> 01:24:46.458
Did you think of me
when you were fucking her?

01:24:46.624 --> 01:24:48.710
Yes.

01:24:50.378 --> 01:24:51.880
Do you love me or not, baby?

01:24:52.046 --> 01:24:53.423
Of course I do.

01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:55.258
She doesn't mean
a thing to me.

01:24:55.425 --> 01:24:56.760
Good.

01:24:58.678 --> 01:25:00.513
- Fuck!
- Oh, oh, shit.

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:03.349
I forgot to load it.
Fuck. Oh, God.

01:25:03.516 --> 01:25:05.477
Can you imagine
if I would have, though?

01:25:05.643 --> 01:25:08.396
- What a mess!
- Emily, you're crazy.

01:25:08.563 --> 01:25:10.899
Hey, it's pretty simple.
You know?

01:25:11.065 --> 01:25:12.859
It's your choice.
Her or me?

01:25:13.026 --> 01:25:15.028
It's not that hard.

01:25:16.946 --> 01:25:19.657
Hey. Stop it.

01:25:19.824 --> 01:25:21.659
You love this.

01:25:21.826 --> 01:25:24.204
Meet me in the bathroom
in 20 seconds.

01:25:25.955 --> 01:25:27.624
Knock twice.

01:25:40.929 --> 01:25:42.305
There he is now.

01:25:42.472 --> 01:25:45.558
Mr. Townsend, Isabel Prager,
Addison First Insurance.

01:25:45.725 --> 01:25:47.119
I'm investigating
the death benefit claim

01:25:47.143 --> 01:25:48.853
for your late wife.

01:25:51.815 --> 01:25:53.149
Sean.

01:25:54.567 --> 01:25:56.486
Did you know that
Emily had a twin?

01:25:59.197 --> 01:26:00.448
No, but...

01:26:00.615 --> 01:26:02.367
Well, I hate
to even say this,

01:26:02.534 --> 01:26:05.995
but it means the body in
the lake could be this sister.

01:26:06.162 --> 01:26:07.539
It could explain
the DNA match.

01:26:07.705 --> 01:26:11.209
And if that's the case,
then where is Emily?

01:26:15.421 --> 01:26:17.465
If my wife was still alive,
she'd come home.

01:26:17.632 --> 01:26:19.300
She'd wanna see her son.

01:26:21.678 --> 01:26:24.639
I'm not a cop, and I'm
definitely no therapist.

01:26:24.806 --> 01:26:26.975
I'm just an insurance guy.

01:26:27.141 --> 01:26:30.520
But this is an incredibly
interesting case.

01:26:30.687 --> 01:26:33.022
- This is just bananas, isn't it?
- Yeah.

01:26:33.189 --> 01:26:35.692
I will say,
it's unusual

01:26:35.859 --> 01:26:37.419
to live with someone
as husband and wife

01:26:37.569 --> 01:26:39.028
and not know
that they have a twin.

01:26:39.195 --> 01:26:40.989
Well, she was a very
private person.

01:26:41.155 --> 01:26:44.492
Well, hey,
we all have our secrets.

01:26:46.411 --> 01:26:47.811
But, as I'm sure
you can understand,

01:26:47.954 --> 01:26:49.372
with a payment of this size,

01:26:49.539 --> 01:26:51.499
we'll have to continue
this claims investigation.

01:26:51.666 --> 01:26:52.834
Of course.

01:26:53.001 --> 01:26:55.712
And, by law, give all our
findings to the authorities.

01:26:55.879 --> 01:26:57.505
Of course,
anything you need.

01:26:57.672 --> 01:26:59.507
I just hope that my wife
is still alive.

01:26:59.674 --> 01:27:01.092
I want her back.

01:27:05.096 --> 01:27:06.431
Okey-dokey, then.

01:27:06.598 --> 01:27:08.057
Obviously, if you
do hear from her...

01:27:08.224 --> 01:27:10.202
- You'll be the first to know.
- Thank you so much!

01:27:10.226 --> 01:27:12.437
Okay, thank you.
Thanks for the coffee.

01:27:13.938 --> 01:27:16.232
- Bye. Thank you so much again.
- Thanks. Yeah.

01:27:17.358 --> 01:27:18.735
You knew that she had a twin.

01:27:18.902 --> 01:27:21.404
Did I? Why didn't you?

01:27:21.571 --> 01:27:23.114
You knew
and you didn't tell me.

01:27:23.281 --> 01:27:24.699
Sean.

01:27:24.866 --> 01:27:26.576
You sound crazy.

01:27:26.743 --> 01:27:27.952
I...

01:27:28.119 --> 01:27:29.495
Take a Xanax.

01:27:29.662 --> 01:27:31.748
Take two.

01:27:31.915 --> 01:27:33.291
<i>Hi, moms. Stephanie here.</i>

01:27:33.458 --> 01:27:34.626
<i>Today, we're talking about</i>

01:27:34.792 --> 01:27:35.835
<i>tombstone tributes.</i>

01:27:36.002 --> 01:27:37.295
<i>I want to thank Helen</i>

01:27:37.462 --> 01:27:39.182
<i>from Missoula, Montana,
for the suggestions,</i>

01:27:39.213 --> 01:27:40.423
<i>for thinking outside the box.</i>

01:27:40.590 --> 01:27:42.634
<i>You know, it doesn't have</i>

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:44.469
<i>to just be flowers anymore.</i>

01:27:44.636 --> 01:27:47.013
<i>I think any item that</i>

01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:49.682
<i>sparks a fond memory is perfect.</i>

01:27:49.849 --> 01:27:52.185
<i>And Emily's favorite treat
was a dry gin martini</i>

01:27:52.352 --> 01:27:54.020
<i>in the late afternoon.</i>

01:27:54.187 --> 01:27:56.439
<i>I'm gonna make a couple
just like Emily used to.</i>

01:27:56.606 --> 01:27:59.442
<i>Frozen gin, frozen glass,</i>

01:27:59.609 --> 01:28:01.069
<i>generous twist.</i>

01:28:01.235 --> 01:28:03.404
<i>I'm gonna head out there
a little later today.</i>

01:28:04.530 --> 01:28:06.240
<i>Have a toast on her grave.</i>

01:28:10.536 --> 01:28:12.872
Nice big twist.
I taught you well.

01:28:13.039 --> 01:28:14.874
Student's become
the master.

01:28:15.041 --> 01:28:17.585
Ooh, wisdom.

01:28:19.003 --> 01:28:20.463
Hey, give me that.

01:28:20.630 --> 01:28:22.215
I don't know
what tricks you have

01:28:22.382 --> 01:28:24.467
up those new
sleeves of yours.

01:28:24.634 --> 01:28:26.135
You think
I poisoned both drinks?

01:28:26.302 --> 01:28:27.720
That's not my style.

01:28:27.887 --> 01:28:29.806
I don't even eat gluten.

01:28:32.767 --> 01:28:34.560
- Want another?
- Please.

01:28:35.895 --> 01:28:38.648
First, tell me why you killed
your father and sister.

01:28:38.815 --> 01:28:41.359
Okay, why don't we first talk
about your son's real father?

01:28:41.526 --> 01:28:43.945
Oh! Emily,
I hold all the cards here.

01:28:44.112 --> 01:28:45.947
I wanna know
about your twin, Faith.

01:28:46.114 --> 01:28:48.992
- I'm not a twin.
- Great. I know that you are.

01:28:49.158 --> 01:28:51.285
We were triplets.
Faith, Hope, and Charity.

01:28:51.452 --> 01:28:52.912
Charity was stillborn.

01:28:53.079 --> 01:28:54.664
Mom thought
we offed her in the womb.

01:28:54.831 --> 01:28:56.791
- Hmm.
- Dad believed her.

01:28:56.958 --> 01:28:59.168
She's quite a woman,
your mother.

01:29:00.253 --> 01:29:01.963
I had a nice afternoon
with Mags.

01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:03.673
You met my mother?

01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:05.883
She likes her martinis
even stronger than yours.

01:29:06.050 --> 01:29:07.969
We had a little walk
down memory lane.

01:29:08.136 --> 01:29:10.221
She's a cold woman, Em.

01:29:10.388 --> 01:29:12.306
Bet you couldn't do
anything right in her eyes.

01:29:12.473 --> 01:29:15.393
It was probably
Faith's idea to set the fire.

01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:17.413
But then all the bad ideas
were Faith's, weren't they?

01:29:17.437 --> 01:29:18.914
- You don't know anything.
- Sure I do.

01:29:18.938 --> 01:29:20.356
And I get it.

01:29:20.523 --> 01:29:22.358
<i>You're 16.</i>

01:29:22.525 --> 01:29:25.361
<i>It's that age
where you feel so trapped.</i>

01:29:26.612 --> 01:29:29.574
<i>And if your mother always
had the biting comment...</i>

01:29:35.913 --> 01:29:37.790
- Faith, it's over. Let's go!
- Dad! Dad!

01:29:37.957 --> 01:29:40.293
- Dad! Don't touch me!
- It's not my fault!

01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:42.180
<i>...I'm guessing your father
was more direct.</i>

01:29:42.253 --> 01:29:44.130
- MR.
- Whore!

01:29:44.297 --> 01:29:46.257
- Never again!
- Stop!

01:29:46.424 --> 01:29:47.467
That's when you and Faith

01:29:47.633 --> 01:29:49.343
learned to hit
the reset button, right?

01:29:50.636 --> 01:29:51.929
Burn, baby, burn.

01:30:00.271 --> 01:30:01.647
<i>Why'd you leave each other?</i>

01:30:01.814 --> 01:30:04.525
Well, we couldn't stay
together after the fire.

01:30:04.692 --> 01:30:06.778
The cops were looking for
the big blonde arson twins.

01:30:06.944 --> 01:30:09.489
<i>We were a walking sideshow.</i>

01:30:09.655 --> 01:30:11.824
Fuck off!

01:30:11.991 --> 01:30:14.535
We... we had to say goodbye,
so we did it with tattoos -

01:30:14.702 --> 01:30:17.705
flames and a little
something for Charity.

01:30:23.002 --> 01:30:24.962
We split up
in Corpus Christi.

01:30:25.129 --> 01:30:27.381
<i>She was gonna head south to
Mexico, I was gonna go north.</i>

01:30:27.548 --> 01:30:29.175
<i>We set a time
and place to meet</i>

01:30:29.342 --> 01:30:31.219
<i>after the smoke cleared.</i>

01:30:31.385 --> 01:30:33.304
<i>But then
she never showed up.</i>

01:30:34.472 --> 01:30:36.808
<i>I was worried sick.
I waited for days.</i>

01:30:36.974 --> 01:30:38.434
<i>But nothing.</i>

01:30:38.601 --> 01:30:39.921
You know, I thought
maybe this was

01:30:40.061 --> 01:30:41.521
my opportunity
to do it on my own.

01:30:41.687 --> 01:30:43.123
She was always
getting me into trouble.

01:30:43.147 --> 01:30:45.626
So I bought a one-way ticket to
New York and never looked back.

01:30:45.650 --> 01:30:47.693
- Did you miss her?
- Of course I missed her.

01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:50.196
I wasn't whole without her.
But I couldn't go on like that.

01:30:50.363 --> 01:30:52.156
- I had to survive.
- And it worked.

01:30:52.323 --> 01:30:54.200
Yeah, my life in New York
fell into place.

01:30:54.367 --> 01:30:56.702
I got a job,
worked my way up.

01:30:56.869 --> 01:30:59.122
I met the perfect man.

01:30:59.288 --> 01:31:01.457
Oh, you know
that part, though.

01:31:01.624 --> 01:31:04.210
- And then your sister calls.
- Fucking Facebook.

01:31:04.377 --> 01:31:06.462
- You had to see her.
- Yeah, of course I did.

01:31:06.629 --> 01:31:09.340
So you fabricate
this trip to Miami,

01:31:09.507 --> 01:31:11.008
meet up at the old camp.

01:31:11.175 --> 01:31:13.219
Camp bunk four.
It was our happy place.

01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:18.224
<i>It was the only place we could
escape our dad, really.</i>

01:31:26.858 --> 01:31:28.317
<i>It must have been shocking</i>

01:31:28.484 --> 01:31:30.194
<i>to see her
after all those years.</i>

01:31:31.362 --> 01:31:34.323
<i>Yeah, it was like
looking in the mirror...</i>

01:31:34.490 --> 01:31:36.993
...except at the sick life
she chose over me.

01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:39.787
<i>- What did she want?
- Everything.</i>

01:31:41.956 --> 01:31:44.709
You just gonna stand there?

01:31:44.876 --> 01:31:46.085
You gotta have Faith.

01:31:46.252 --> 01:31:48.504
I don't hear from you
for 14 years,

01:31:48.671 --> 01:31:50.298
and now here you are?

01:31:50.464 --> 01:31:52.800
- I'm out of cash.
- Shocking.

01:31:54.135 --> 01:31:56.179
The fuck did you say?

01:31:58.389 --> 01:31:59.599
Nothing. I just...

01:31:59.765 --> 01:32:01.642
Get away with it this time.

01:32:01.809 --> 01:32:03.895
Okay, so, um... now what?

01:32:04.061 --> 01:32:05.980
I don't know.
I didn't know where to go.

01:32:06.147 --> 01:32:07.773
When I call,
you act like a stranger.

01:32:07.940 --> 01:32:09.817
Won't even let me
come meet your family.

01:32:09.984 --> 01:32:11.569
What am I supposed
to say to them?

01:32:11.736 --> 01:32:13.404
The truth?

01:32:13.571 --> 01:32:14.989
Well, you may as well now

01:32:15.156 --> 01:32:17.533
'cause I'm about
to tell the cops.

01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:20.995
- You're what?
- I don't know what else to do.

01:32:21.162 --> 01:32:22.788
I mean, I don't have anything,

01:32:22.955 --> 01:32:24.957
so I don't really have
anything to lose.

01:32:25.124 --> 01:32:26.684
I'm gonna go tell them
everything we did

01:32:26.834 --> 01:32:28.437
and then, you know,
we'll go down together.

01:32:28.461 --> 01:32:29.837
We can be together again.

01:32:30.004 --> 01:32:31.547
I have a little boy now.

01:32:31.714 --> 01:32:34.258
Yeah, I know. I saw that kid.
He's super cute.

01:32:34.425 --> 01:32:37.428
Cut the shit, okay?
What do you want from me?

01:32:39.180 --> 01:32:40.556
I want a million bucks.

01:32:40.723 --> 01:32:42.266
How am I supposed
to give you that?

01:32:42.433 --> 01:32:43.559
You're rich and famous now.

01:32:43.726 --> 01:32:45.770
I can't give you
a million dollars.

01:32:45.937 --> 01:32:47.688
You do seem
highly motivated.

01:32:47.855 --> 01:32:50.775
I don't know what it is, though.
I don't think it's your job.

01:32:50.942 --> 01:32:52.818
Probably, um...
probably your kid.

01:32:52.985 --> 01:32:55.321
Don't talk about Nicky.

01:32:55.488 --> 01:32:57.365
Yeah, I'll, um...

01:32:57.531 --> 01:33:00.618
I'll sell the house.
I'll do whatever I need to do.

01:33:00.785 --> 01:33:02.453
If I do this,
you can't tell anyone ever.

01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:05.456
- Do you understand?
- Yeah, yeah, I get it.

01:33:05.623 --> 01:33:07.503
I mean, I don't really get
the big deal, though,

01:33:07.667 --> 01:33:10.211
'cause you and me could always
just make another kid.

01:33:10.378 --> 01:33:12.463
You know that, right?

01:33:12.630 --> 01:33:14.215
You can't make
another sister, though.

01:33:15.424 --> 01:33:17.385
Oh, it's fucking hot.

01:33:17.551 --> 01:33:19.136
Come on,
let's go swimming.

01:33:19.303 --> 01:33:21.597
Remember?
Like we used to.

01:33:22.932 --> 01:33:24.308
- You coming?
- Yeah.

01:33:24.475 --> 01:33:26.310
Right behind you.

01:33:36.696 --> 01:33:38.197
<i>How'd you
get her in the lake?</i>

01:33:38.364 --> 01:33:39.824
<i>Fuck you.
I didn't kill my sister.</i>

01:33:39.991 --> 01:33:41.742
<i>That was her idea.</i>

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.626
Come on, wimp.

01:33:52.461 --> 01:33:54.297
What? I thought
you were the alpha now.

01:33:54.463 --> 01:33:55.840
No?

01:33:56.007 --> 01:33:57.633
I am the alpha,
God damn it.

01:34:14.734 --> 01:34:16.652
You abandoned me.

01:34:16.819 --> 01:34:19.322
We were supposed
to be a team, you and me.

01:34:19.488 --> 01:34:21.699
- Remember?
- Yeah, I know we were.

01:34:21.866 --> 01:34:23.909
But I just thought

01:34:24.076 --> 01:34:26.829
the only chance
we had was alone, so...

01:34:26.996 --> 01:34:28.456
You were right.

01:34:28.622 --> 01:34:30.708
I'm sorry, kid.

01:34:34.837 --> 01:34:36.964
Me too.

01:35:31.769 --> 01:35:33.270
<i>I was so worried.</i>

01:35:33.437 --> 01:35:34.814
I woke up the next morning

01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:36.982
and I couldn't
find her anywhere.

01:35:38.567 --> 01:35:40.111
I never thought...

01:35:41.737 --> 01:35:43.739
...I never thought
she'd do that, you know?

01:35:46.450 --> 01:35:48.953
When I found her body
in the lake, it was too late.

01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:51.455
Lie. You drowned her.

01:35:51.622 --> 01:35:53.457
No, she killed herself.

01:35:53.624 --> 01:35:55.000
I'm just all that's left of her.

01:35:55.167 --> 01:35:57.753
- No, you're a sister killer.
- You're a brotherfucker.

01:35:57.920 --> 01:35:59.213
Ooh!

01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:00.506
What does Sean know?

01:36:00.673 --> 01:36:02.258
Everything.

01:36:02.425 --> 01:36:03.843
It was his idea.

01:36:04.009 --> 01:36:06.053
I didn't know what to do
once I found the body

01:36:06.220 --> 01:36:08.281
and he said, "You know,
maybe this is our opportunity.

01:36:08.305 --> 01:36:09.890
"We could finally
get out of debt,

01:36:10.057 --> 01:36:11.600
"flee the country,

01:36:11.767 --> 01:36:13.310
"spend more time with Nicky."

01:36:13.477 --> 01:36:15.187
He convinced me
we could pull it off,

01:36:15.354 --> 01:36:17.022
you know, that her DNA
would do the rest.

01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:19.400
I don't believe you.
He grieved for you.

01:36:19.567 --> 01:36:22.069
Oh, you believed that?
Aw, that was all an act.

01:36:22.236 --> 01:36:23.612
You're a pathological liar.

01:36:23.779 --> 01:36:25.489
Did Sean say that?

01:36:27.283 --> 01:36:28.826
Cool.

01:36:28.993 --> 01:36:31.662
I'm just gonna play you
this tune real quick.

01:36:35.166 --> 01:36:37.334
<i>- Do you love her?
- No.</i>

01:36:37.501 --> 01:36:38.878
<i>It was just sex.</i>

01:36:39.044 --> 01:36:41.213
<i>Did you think of me
when you were fucking her?</i>

01:36:41.380 --> 01:36:42.756
<i>Yes.</i>

01:36:42.923 --> 01:36:45.050
<i>Do you love me
or not, baby?</i>

01:36:45.217 --> 01:36:46.802
<i>Of course I do.</i>

01:36:46.969 --> 01:36:48.679
<i>She doesn't mean
a thing to me.</i>

01:36:48.846 --> 01:36:51.474
I'm sorry, baby. I know
you thought it was real.

01:36:52.975 --> 01:36:55.186
But, hey, I mean,
look on the bright side.

01:36:55.352 --> 01:36:57.354
Your website went viral
thanks to me.

01:36:57.521 --> 01:36:59.356
All this for a little money?

01:36:59.523 --> 01:37:02.318
A little $4 million?

01:37:02.485 --> 01:37:05.112
That's not exactly little, huh?

01:37:05.279 --> 01:37:07.239
I was hiding out
till that money came in.

01:37:07.406 --> 01:37:09.074
He was just gonna
tie up some loose ends.

01:37:09.241 --> 01:37:10.534
Was I a loose end?

01:37:10.701 --> 01:37:12.578
Well, he needed
help with Nicky.

01:37:12.745 --> 01:37:14.205
You're so good
with those kids.

01:37:14.371 --> 01:37:16.707
So what happens now?

01:37:16.874 --> 01:37:18.667
I just want my kid.

01:37:18.834 --> 01:37:20.586
You fucked up
my insurance plan.

01:37:20.753 --> 01:37:22.272
The authorities
won't back down on that.

01:37:22.296 --> 01:37:23.964
You can have Sean.
He's a piece of shit.

01:37:24.131 --> 01:37:26.300
- I don't even want him.
- I don't want Sean.

01:37:26.467 --> 01:37:28.511
Then I don't know.
I guess there's...

01:37:29.595 --> 01:37:31.639
There's another way, but...

01:37:31.805 --> 01:37:34.099
...it's sort of one
mother to another.

01:37:38.479 --> 01:37:40.481
Sleeping like a log.

01:38:07.883 --> 01:38:09.927
- Oh!
- What's going on?

01:38:10.094 --> 01:38:12.221
They have a warrant.
I tried to call you.

01:38:13.264 --> 01:38:14.723
Excuse me.
I'm Sean Townsend.

01:38:14.890 --> 01:38:16.810
Look, I'm happy to comply
with anything you need.

01:38:16.976 --> 01:38:19.019
But it would be nice
to have a heads-up.

01:38:19.186 --> 01:38:20.896
This is an open investigation.

01:38:21.063 --> 01:38:23.190
You don't get to pencil
us in when it's convenient.

01:38:30.239 --> 01:38:31.949
Hey.

01:38:32.116 --> 01:38:33.409
Am I under arrest?

01:38:33.576 --> 01:38:35.995
Oh, no, not yet.
The DA wants a slam dunk.

01:38:36.161 --> 01:38:38.181
That's gonna be pretty hard
since I haven't done anything.

01:38:38.205 --> 01:38:40.583
Did you know
your wife was alive?

01:38:40.749 --> 01:38:42.751
- Not until recently.
- When?

01:38:42.918 --> 01:38:44.461
She contacted me.

01:38:44.628 --> 01:38:46.668
And you immediately notified
the authorities, right?

01:38:46.797 --> 01:38:49.008
I can't discuss this
without my attorney.

01:38:49.174 --> 01:38:51.236
You know what? You really
are a professor, aren't you?

01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:52.886
Okay, we'll talk soon.

01:38:53.053 --> 01:38:55.097
Oh, uh, if we need
to contact you,

01:38:55.264 --> 01:38:57.433
will you be with your wife
or the best friend?

01:38:59.268 --> 01:39:00.811
Somebody else?

01:39:10.029 --> 01:39:11.989
I need a stiff drink.
Maybe some of your...

01:39:12.156 --> 01:39:13.824
I'm sorry. You can't come in.

01:39:13.991 --> 01:39:16.452
What? Where's Nicky?

01:39:16.619 --> 01:39:17.911
He's upstairs playing.

01:39:18.078 --> 01:39:20.080
- You have to go.
- What are you talking about?

01:39:20.247 --> 01:39:21.766
This is an ongoing
investigation, Sean.

01:39:21.790 --> 01:39:22.833
Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.209
I can't let you in this house

01:39:24.376 --> 01:39:25.812
until this whole thing's
been solved.

01:39:25.836 --> 01:39:27.063
She's gotten to you, hasn't she?

01:39:27.087 --> 01:39:28.398
This has nothing
to do with Emily.

01:39:28.422 --> 01:39:30.591
It's got everything
to do with her.

01:39:30.758 --> 01:39:32.426
She's gaslighting you!

01:39:32.593 --> 01:39:34.261
You don't understand
how powerful she is.

01:39:34.428 --> 01:39:36.597
No, I don't understand
anything right now.

01:39:36.764 --> 01:39:38.223
Stephanie, don't do this.

01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:40.017
Please don't make me
call the police.

01:40:18.097 --> 01:40:20.557
<i>Stephanie,
please call me back.</i>

01:40:20.724 --> 01:40:22.559
<i>I don't know
what's going on</i>

01:40:22.726 --> 01:40:24.687
<i>or how this is
all going to turn out.</i>

01:40:24.853 --> 01:40:26.230
<i>But you're a great mum,</i>

01:40:26.397 --> 01:40:28.857
<i>and you taught me
how to be a better dad.</i>

01:40:29.024 --> 01:40:31.527
<i>For that,
I'll always be grateful.</i>

01:40:31.694 --> 01:40:35.614
<i>The truth is I don't think
I ever knew my wife</i>

01:40:35.781 --> 01:40:37.991
<i>or what she's capable of.</i>

01:41:13.152 --> 01:41:14.570
<i>A shocking new development</i>

01:41:14.737 --> 01:41:16.196
<i>in the Emily Nelson case,</i>

01:41:16.363 --> 01:41:19.324
<i>which first went viral
on a popular internet vlog.</i>

01:41:19.491 --> 01:41:20.971
<i>The PR executive
who was believed dead</i>

01:41:21.118 --> 01:41:22.619
<i>in Michigan has resurfaced.</i>

01:41:22.786 --> 01:41:25.038
<i>And it appears
the body found in the lake</i>

01:41:25.205 --> 01:41:27.082
<i>was that of Nelson's
estranged twin sister.</i>

01:41:27.249 --> 01:41:29.334
<i>Nelson's husband,
Sean Townsend,</i>

01:41:29.501 --> 01:41:31.628
<i>an abusive failed novelist
and English professor,</i>

01:41:31.795 --> 01:41:34.965
<i>allegedly forced her
to stage her own death</i>

01:41:35.132 --> 01:41:37.676
<i>in order to collect a $4 million
life insurance policy.</i>

01:41:37.843 --> 01:41:39.178
<i>Nevertheless,</i>

01:41:39.344 --> 01:41:41.263
<i>bail for Mr. Townsend
will be set today.</i>

01:41:41.430 --> 01:41:42.806
<i>A British national,</i>

01:41:42.973 --> 01:41:44.850
<i>Townsend faces deportation
if found guilty.</i>

01:41:45.017 --> 01:41:46.769
<i>Although
an accomplice to fraud,</i>

01:41:46.935 --> 01:41:48.896
<i>Ms. Nelson is complying
with the authorities</i>

01:41:49.062 --> 01:41:51.023
<i>in exchange for clemency.</i>

01:41:53.859 --> 01:41:55.027
Stephanie?

01:41:58.906 --> 01:42:01.366
- Where's Nicky?
- Oh, he's at a friend's house.

01:42:01.533 --> 01:42:03.619
- Watching a movie.
- Oof!

01:42:03.786 --> 01:42:06.038
I figured we needed some
Mommy and Daddy time.

01:42:08.165 --> 01:42:10.709
Have you forgotten
me already?

01:42:10.876 --> 01:42:13.253
You're impossible to forget.

01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:14.505
Thank you.

01:42:19.551 --> 01:42:21.887
Oh, please, Sean,
I'm not gonna poison you.

01:42:22.054 --> 01:42:24.389
If I wanted to get rid of you,
you'd already be dead.

01:42:24.556 --> 01:42:26.391
You put those files
on my computer.

01:42:26.558 --> 01:42:29.186
Yes, I did.

01:42:29.353 --> 01:42:30.813
But I did have help
from a woman

01:42:30.979 --> 01:42:32.898
who loves volunteering
for everything.

01:42:33.065 --> 01:42:34.525
Stephanie.

01:42:34.691 --> 01:42:37.152
She's not as sweet
as her snatch, is she?

01:42:37.319 --> 01:42:39.363
Were you ever gonna tell me
you had a twin sister?

01:42:39.530 --> 01:42:41.532
- Wasn't your business.
- I'm your husband!

01:42:41.698 --> 01:42:43.575
You've been fucking
my best friend in my house.

01:42:43.742 --> 01:42:45.536
But now you're
my husband? Okay.

01:42:45.702 --> 01:42:47.871
Then I should probably tell
you that we were triplets.

01:42:48.038 --> 01:42:49.373
The details!

01:42:49.540 --> 01:42:50.707
<i>Hi, moms!</i>

01:42:50.874 --> 01:42:53.252
Stephanie here.

01:42:53.418 --> 01:42:54.795
I wanna thank you for all

01:42:54.962 --> 01:42:56.606
the love and support
you've been sending me.

01:42:56.630 --> 01:42:58.173
It means so much.

01:42:58.340 --> 01:42:59.675
Um...

01:43:00.884 --> 01:43:03.720
You know, as shocked
as you guys are

01:43:03.887 --> 01:43:06.431
about these turns of events,

01:43:06.598 --> 01:43:09.309
I can assure you, nobody
is more stunned than me.

01:43:09.476 --> 01:43:11.854
<i>Emily had her secrets.
So did her husband.</i>

01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:14.356
<i>Clearly, I was
the naive romantic</i>

01:43:14.523 --> 01:43:16.275
<i>caught in the middle.</i>

01:43:16.441 --> 01:43:18.569
<i>I love you guys. I always will.</i>

01:43:18.735 --> 01:43:21.446
<i>I hope you can forgive me in
advance for what I have to do.</i>

01:43:21.613 --> 01:43:24.533
<i>Moms, do everything yourself.</i>

01:43:27.703 --> 01:43:28.871
Stephanie.

01:43:29.037 --> 01:43:30.372
You shouldn't be here right now.

01:43:30.539 --> 01:43:32.457
I used to live here. Remember?

01:43:32.624 --> 01:43:35.085
- Don't make this any hard...
- Don't move.

01:43:36.795 --> 01:43:38.046
Stephanie, please.

01:43:38.213 --> 01:43:40.173
You don't even let the boys
play with squirt guns.

01:43:40.257 --> 01:43:41.857
That was before
you told me you loved me,

01:43:41.884 --> 01:43:43.987
and it turned out you were
laughing at me behind my back.

01:43:44.011 --> 01:43:45.780
Stephanie, maybe we should
take it down a notch.

01:43:45.804 --> 01:43:47.180
You used me.

01:43:47.347 --> 01:43:48.974
You used me too.

01:43:49.141 --> 01:43:50.934
But you had me
making you dinner,

01:43:51.101 --> 01:43:53.979
watching your kid,
and sucking your dick.

01:43:54.146 --> 01:43:55.772
I had no idea
that she was still alive!

01:43:55.939 --> 01:43:58.191
- Stop lying.
- Okay, you guys.

01:43:58.358 --> 01:44:00.402
I think we should just
sit down and talk this out.

01:44:00.569 --> 01:44:02.613
Emily, you sit down.
You hated Stephanie.

01:44:02.779 --> 01:44:05.324
You used to watch her vlog
and rip her apart.

01:44:05.490 --> 01:44:07.034
All I wanted
was to be your friend.

01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:08.493
You were.

01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:11.163
And then you fucked my husband
and my insurance plan.

01:44:11.330 --> 01:44:13.707
Don't blame her!
This is so typical of you.

01:44:13.874 --> 01:44:16.126
I was just trying to get us
out of crushing fucking debt.

01:44:16.293 --> 01:44:18.754
Yeah, maybe if you had the
good sense to give me a call,

01:44:18.921 --> 01:44:20.815
I could've helped you with
this little plot of yours.

01:44:20.839 --> 01:44:23.159
Please, you haven't come up
with a decent plot in 10 years.

01:44:23.216 --> 01:44:24.801
Really? Right now?

01:44:24.968 --> 01:44:27.220
Can I say something,
as the lady with the gun?

01:44:27.387 --> 01:44:29.097
Nicky deserves better
than both of you.

01:44:29.264 --> 01:44:31.642
- Fuck you. I love my kid.
- Shut up!

01:44:33.101 --> 01:44:35.020
Stephanie, put down the gun.

01:44:35.187 --> 01:44:36.813
You don't wanna do this.

01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:39.024
I really do, though.

01:44:41.026 --> 01:44:42.569
I loved you.

01:44:43.654 --> 01:44:45.155
I loved you too.

01:44:47.658 --> 01:44:49.493
I think this is the best thing.

01:44:49.660 --> 01:44:51.578
- Whoa.
- We could say he attacked us.

01:44:51.745 --> 01:44:53.431
- They'll believe us, you know?
- No, no, no.

01:44:53.455 --> 01:44:55.558
You're not fucking serious.
You're not gonna kill him.

01:44:55.582 --> 01:44:57.334
We're just gonna
send him to jail.

01:44:57.501 --> 01:45:00.504
J... Are you serious?
Jail's enough for you?

01:45:00.671 --> 01:45:02.756
- You don't need to kill him.
- Aren't you angry?

01:45:02.923 --> 01:45:04.508
Don't you want revenge
for your sister?

01:45:04.675 --> 01:45:07.344
Yeah, yes. But he didn't
technically kill her.

01:45:07.511 --> 01:45:08.804
Then who did?

01:45:08.971 --> 01:45:11.640
'Cause I don't buy
that it was an accident.

01:45:14.267 --> 01:45:15.811
Screw this.

01:45:16.937 --> 01:45:18.105
Oh!

01:45:18.271 --> 01:45:20.148
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, fuck.

01:45:20.315 --> 01:45:21.608
Oh, my God. Jesus.

01:45:21.775 --> 01:45:23.443
Oh, my God. Um...

01:45:23.610 --> 01:45:26.446
Oh, my God!
Shit! Is he really dead?

01:45:26.613 --> 01:45:29.116
Sean? I'm sorry.
What do I do?

01:45:29.282 --> 01:45:31.576
Do you put pressure on it or...

01:45:31.743 --> 01:45:34.371
Do we call an ambulance?
Do I just let him die?

01:45:34.538 --> 01:45:36.623
I mean, he deserved it, right?

01:45:36.790 --> 01:45:39.751
No, I killed her.
I killed my sister.

01:45:39.918 --> 01:45:42.671
What? Sean? Sean?

01:45:42.838 --> 01:45:44.673
Get up.

01:45:46.633 --> 01:45:48.343
Show's over. Come on.

01:45:48.510 --> 01:45:50.637
Seriously? Come on.
Get the fuck up. Hey!

01:45:50.804 --> 01:45:52.222
You too, Brando.

01:45:52.389 --> 01:45:54.891
- Get up!
- Fuck!

01:45:58.812 --> 01:46:00.355
Wow.

01:46:02.607 --> 01:46:04.359
That was extra.

01:46:04.526 --> 01:46:06.778
I mean, obviously, I knew you
guys were up to something

01:46:06.945 --> 01:46:08.321
when I saw both the mics

01:46:08.488 --> 01:46:10.532
that you had the cops
plant in here.

01:46:10.699 --> 01:46:12.451
You clearly wanted
a confession out of me,

01:46:12.617 --> 01:46:14.244
so you could clear
Sean's name.

01:46:14.411 --> 01:46:17.706
But that was... that was
a good way to go about it.

01:46:17.873 --> 01:46:19.541
Where you messed up,
though, baby girl,

01:46:19.708 --> 01:46:21.293
is thinking
that I would confess

01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:23.045
to protect that
fucking yeast infection.

01:46:23.211 --> 01:46:25.505
- Really?
- All right.

01:46:25.672 --> 01:46:27.549
Come on, you gotta know
better than that.

01:46:27.716 --> 01:46:28.759
Hmm.

01:46:28.925 --> 01:46:30.695
But then you came in,
all emotional with the gun.

01:46:30.719 --> 01:46:33.055
And that was...
that was convincing.

01:46:33.221 --> 01:46:35.766
Yeah. It was very cinematic.

01:46:35.932 --> 01:46:37.642
I don't even know
where you find this shit.

01:46:37.809 --> 01:46:39.352
You're really amazing.

01:46:39.519 --> 01:46:42.022
- Thanks. That means a lot.
- Mmm.

01:46:42.189 --> 01:46:43.774
But you did confess, Emily.

01:46:43.940 --> 01:46:46.651
Oh. Yeah.

01:46:46.818 --> 01:46:48.612
Um...

01:46:48.779 --> 01:46:52.240
I did, but I cut
these first, though.

01:46:52.407 --> 01:46:54.451
For our friendship bracelets.

01:46:54.618 --> 01:46:56.328
One for you!

01:46:56.495 --> 01:46:59.539
That is... disappointing.

01:46:59.706 --> 01:47:02.292
Oh! My God!
Look what I found.

01:47:02.459 --> 01:47:04.127
Huh!

01:47:04.294 --> 01:47:06.588
Okay. You can't shoot us.

01:47:06.755 --> 01:47:09.925
- The police are outside.
- No, they're not.

01:47:10.092 --> 01:47:12.052
"Hey, cops, Stephanie here.

01:47:12.219 --> 01:47:13.678
"Change of plans.

01:47:13.845 --> 01:47:15.656
"I'm meeting Emily and Sean
at Darren's house now.

01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:17.057
"I'll see you there."

01:47:17.224 --> 01:47:18.809
You sent them
to Darren's house?

01:47:18.975 --> 01:47:21.144
It's a virus?

01:47:21.311 --> 01:47:23.230
String theory!
String theory, isn't it?

01:47:23.396 --> 01:47:26.233
Hands up! Weapons down!

01:47:26.399 --> 01:47:27.901
No, I have
a prescription for that!

01:47:28.068 --> 01:47:29.486
I have ocular pressure!

01:47:29.653 --> 01:47:30.987
I've been on the run
for 10 years.

01:47:31.154 --> 01:47:32.965
You think I don't know how
to manipulate the system?

01:47:32.989 --> 01:47:34.616
So you're gonna kill us?

01:47:34.783 --> 01:47:36.868
Well, what the fuck else
am I supposed to do?

01:47:37.035 --> 01:47:38.411
You two will clearly go

01:47:38.578 --> 01:47:40.178
to extraordinary lengths
to take me down.

01:47:40.330 --> 01:47:41.832
And you know too much.

01:47:41.998 --> 01:47:44.000
So, I feel like
a murder-suicide

01:47:44.167 --> 01:47:46.253
is the only fitting end
for you two.

01:47:46.419 --> 01:47:47.838
And if you kill him,

01:47:48.004 --> 01:47:50.048
I think our insurance
still covers that, right?

01:47:50.215 --> 01:47:52.092
I mean, it's sort of perfect.

01:47:52.259 --> 01:47:54.678
One door closes and another
one opens. Thank you for that.

01:47:54.845 --> 01:47:57.180
You always have been
fucking crazy, haven't you?

01:47:57.347 --> 01:47:58.890
Have I?

01:47:59.057 --> 01:48:00.725
Ugh!

01:48:00.892 --> 01:48:02.769
Oh, shit. You're right.

01:48:02.936 --> 01:48:05.522
God, you fucking...
You actually fucking shot me.

01:48:05.689 --> 01:48:07.190
I'm gonna miss him.

01:48:07.357 --> 01:48:08.859
Your turn.

01:48:09.025 --> 01:48:11.236
Emily, come on.

01:48:11.403 --> 01:48:12.821
You're not gonna kill me.

01:48:12.988 --> 01:48:15.282
Oh, yeah, I killed
my dad and my sister,

01:48:15.448 --> 01:48:18.368
but I could never kill my
husband-fucking best friend.

01:48:19.411 --> 01:48:21.121
Am I really
your best friend?

01:48:21.288 --> 01:48:23.206
You're not just saying
that for, you know...

01:48:23.373 --> 01:48:24.933
No, no, I'm not
just saying that at all.

01:48:25.041 --> 01:48:26.877
I get worried that it's just me.

01:48:27.043 --> 01:48:28.883
I know, sometimes
I was worried about that too.

01:48:30.380 --> 01:48:31.941
It's so hard to connect
with other moms...

01:48:31.965 --> 01:48:33.967
And then when you have
a full-time job, it's...

01:48:34.134 --> 01:48:35.635
Okay, okay,
don't pull that crap.

01:48:35.802 --> 01:48:38.180
Being a mom is a full-time job.
What I do is hard work.

01:48:38.346 --> 01:48:40.015
And I have my vlog
on top of that,

01:48:40.182 --> 01:48:41.742
and that's just getting
bigger and bigger.

01:48:41.766 --> 01:48:43.685
If you came on the vlog,
that'd be so fun.

01:48:43.852 --> 01:48:45.770
If you came on the vlog
and confessed

01:48:45.937 --> 01:48:48.207
to killing your father and
sister and held me at gunpoint,

01:48:48.231 --> 01:48:49.834
I could probably hit
a million subscribers.

01:48:49.858 --> 01:48:51.443
Aww. That would've been great.

01:48:51.610 --> 01:48:53.862
- Why don't we do that right now?
- Hmm?

01:48:54.029 --> 01:48:56.198
We're live streaming.
Did you not know that?

01:48:56.364 --> 01:48:57.949
What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:48:58.116 --> 01:49:00.035
God, that's so rude,
I'm sorry.

01:49:00.202 --> 01:49:01.870
Wave hi to the moms!

01:49:03.079 --> 01:49:04.915
<i>This little gadget. Boop!</i>

01:49:05.081 --> 01:49:07.626
Yeah. They make nanny cams
so small these days.

01:49:09.252 --> 01:49:10.462
Brotherfucker!

01:49:13.298 --> 01:49:15.675
Emily!
Emily, stop!

01:49:15.842 --> 01:49:18.845
Emily, you can't outrun this!
Don't do this to Nicky.

01:49:19.012 --> 01:49:21.139
Come on, you're still his mom!

01:49:24.059 --> 01:49:25.977
Yeah, I am.

01:49:26.144 --> 01:49:27.646
But you sure
as shit won't be.

01:49:35.278 --> 01:49:36.863
America's hybrids.

01:49:37.030 --> 01:49:38.907
Silent, but deadly.

01:49:42.953 --> 01:49:44.704
I saw you on the vlog.

01:49:44.871 --> 01:49:47.540
You fuck with one of the moms,
you fuck with us all.

01:49:47.707 --> 01:49:49.501
Oh!

01:49:49.668 --> 01:49:50.835
Emily!

01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:53.546
Stop, Emily.

01:49:53.713 --> 01:49:55.966
This looks super painful.

01:49:56.132 --> 01:49:57.926
Now, sweetie, stop.

01:49:58.093 --> 01:49:59.844
You've just been hit by a car.

01:50:00.011 --> 01:50:01.388
Don't... don't do this.

01:50:01.554 --> 01:50:03.598
I'm getting worried
about your knees right now.

01:50:04.683 --> 01:50:06.309
Just relax!

01:50:11.982 --> 01:50:13.525
I'm sorry!

01:50:13.692 --> 01:50:15.026
I'm NOT sorry. Oh!

01:50:15.193 --> 01:50:16.528
I'm still working on that.

01:50:21.199 --> 01:50:22.575
Hi, moms! Stephanie here.

01:50:22.742 --> 01:50:24.202
We have very exciting news today

01:50:24.369 --> 01:50:25.745
because we signed up

01:50:25.912 --> 01:50:27.497
our one-millionth subscriber,

01:50:27.664 --> 01:50:30.917
Mrs. Carol Findley
of Ames, Iowa!

01:50:31.084 --> 01:50:33.503
Thank you
for joining us, Carol.

01:50:33.670 --> 01:50:36.006
You should know,
as our newest friend,

01:50:36.172 --> 01:50:38.292
that in addition to my usual
helpful tips and recipes,

01:50:38.383 --> 01:50:40.677
I now take on
unsolved mysteries

01:50:40.844 --> 01:50:42.887
'cause it turns out
I have a nose

01:50:43.054 --> 01:50:45.473
for sniffing out
the freshest basil...

01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:47.892
...and criminals who thought
they got away with it.

01:50:48.059 --> 01:50:49.477
<i>So if you have a cold case</i>

01:50:49.644 --> 01:50:51.271
<i>or a mystery that
needs to be unraveled,</i>

01:50:51.438 --> 01:50:52.772
<i>you can just drop me a line.</i>

01:50:52.939 --> 01:50:54.357
<i>That includes
you now, Carol,</i>

01:50:54.524 --> 01:50:55.984
<i>because you're part
of the family.</i>

01:50:56.151 --> 01:50:58.361
<i>For now, we're gonna
be talking about</i>

01:50:58.528 --> 01:51:00.238
<i>my favorite cold soup,
gazpacho,</i>

01:51:00.405 --> 01:51:02.425
<i>which is normally gross, but
we're not gonna make it gross.</i>

01:51:02.449 --> 01:51:03.729
<i>Right, guys?
It's gonna be great.</i>

01:51:49.704 --> 01:51:51.748
In your ass!
