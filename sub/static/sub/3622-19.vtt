07:13.300 --> 07:15.300
We kept Go City safe from evil,

07:15.302 --> 07:18.303
but the more we fought evil,
the more Shego liked it.

07:18.305 --> 07:18.937
The fighting?

07:18.939 --> 07:20.071
The evil.

07:20.073 --> 07:21.640
Right. Once Shego went bad,

07:21.642 --> 07:23.241
it was never the same.

and she knocked hard.

of us special powers.

07:41.295 --> 07:42.994

09:21.795 --> 09:23.695
I, too, lost my powers.

09:23.697 --> 09:26.231
Uh, Hego,
let's focus here. On <i>me.</i>

09:26.233 --> 09:27.365
We need to figure out

09:27.367 --> 09:29.267
where Aviarius
is going to strike next.

09:29.269 --> 09:30.802
( <i>gasps</i>)

09:30.804 --> 09:31.803
The twins!
The twins!

09:31.805 --> 09:33.271
Greetings, Team Go.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.373
You have something I want

09:35.375 --> 09:37.475
and I have something <i>you</i> want.

09:37.477 --> 09:41.613
You'll never
get away with this, Aviarius.

09:41.615 --> 09:43.648
Never. Like he said.

09:43.650 --> 09:45.283
Hey, it's the Go Tower.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.118
There's Hego and Mego.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.453
Hi, guys!
Hi, guys!

09:48.455 --> 09:51.089
I will not rest
until all of the powers

09:51.091 --> 09:53.124
of Team Go are mine to control.

09:53.126 --> 09:55.160
Surrender the superstrong girl,

09:55.162 --> 09:57.862
or you'll never see
the twins again.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.735
So, you know where Aviarius is?

10:03.737 --> 10:05.470
Oh, yes.
That's his lair.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.606
He calls it...

10:07.608 --> 10:08.573
The Nest?

10:08.575 --> 10:09.407
Yes.

10:09.409 --> 10:10.442
You know, this guy needs

10:10.444 --> 10:11.309
to dig deeper.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.311
So where is the mountain,

10:12.312 --> 10:13.345
the Himalayas?

10:13.347 --> 10:15.413
No, that's the peak
of Go Mountain,

10:15.415 --> 10:17.282
just outside of Go City.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.483
Convenient.

10:18.485 --> 10:20.118
I found that a long-distance
relationship

10:20.120 --> 10:21.519
with a foe never works.

10:21.521 --> 10:22.754
It's a strain on everyone.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.889
Hego, how did you defeat
Aviarius in the past?

10:24.891 --> 10:26.358
Teamwork.

10:26.360 --> 10:28.593
Or as I like to call it,
Go-Operation.

10:28.595 --> 10:30.495
Ha-ha, good one!

10:30.497 --> 10:31.830
Yeah!

10:31.832 --> 10:33.531
I'm starting to see
why Shego split.

10:33.533 --> 10:35.500
And we're going
to have to get her back.

10:35.502 --> 10:36.635
No, no, no, really,

10:36.637 --> 10:39.671
I'm listening. Go on.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.706
This rare mutagenic agent
that you stole for me

10:41.708 --> 10:42.807
will unlock the key to...

10:42.809 --> 10:44.409
( <i>loud crash</i> )

10:44.411 --> 10:45.477
Knock, knock.

10:45.479 --> 10:47.178
Kim Possible?!

10:47.180 --> 10:48.246
Since when do you glow?

10:48.248 --> 10:50.148
Like Hego.

10:50.150 --> 10:50.915
Greetings, sister.

10:50.917 --> 10:52.350
Hey, Shego.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.918
You know, you missed
my birthday.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.353
A call, a card...

10:55.355 --> 10:56.688
any acknowledgment
would be nice.

10:58.224 --> 11:00.291
Uh, I believe some introductions
are in order here.

11:00.293 --> 11:01.960
I'm Ron Stoppable.
We've met before,

11:01.962 --> 11:03.495
but you never seem

11:03.497 --> 11:05.263
to remember my name.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.666
Can you excuse us, Dr. D?

11:07.668 --> 11:11.169
Shego, as long as you're
going to live under my roof,

11:11.171 --> 11:12.470
you'll follow my rules.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.806
And rule number one:
no secrets.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.508
Whatever is going on...

11:17.576 --> 11:18.943
is obviously a private matter.

11:18.945 --> 11:20.745
Later, gators.

11:20.747 --> 11:24.516
You know, I do think of us
as a kind of evil family,

11:24.518 --> 11:26.217
and families stick together.

11:26.219 --> 11:27.852
So if you need me...

11:27.854 --> 11:29.487
I'll be there for you.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.356
Looks like all of my
least-favorite people in the world

11:31.358 --> 11:34.459
have gotten together
to form a club. Why?

11:34.461 --> 11:35.860
Aviarius.

11:48.307 --> 11:50.275
( <i>engines whining</i> )

11:56.515 --> 11:58.783
It's great to have you back
on the team, sis.

11:58.785 --> 12:00.485
Here's my plan.

12:00.487 --> 12:01.586
You, don't talk.

12:01.588 --> 12:04.322
Seriously, Hego, give it a rest.

12:04.324 --> 12:07.525
The whole team leader thing
is so old.

12:07.527 --> 12:10.361
Yeah, you...
same as him.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.397
All right, let me see
if I got this right:

12:12.399 --> 12:14.365
Possible and I
are the only ones with power?

12:14.367 --> 12:16.668
Uh, what about the power
of imagination?

12:16.670 --> 12:18.303
I believe we all have that.

12:18.305 --> 12:19.370
That's true.

12:19.372 --> 12:20.638
I'm starting
to like this fellow.

12:20.640 --> 12:21.706
He's a positive thinker.

12:21.708 --> 12:24.409
And you people wonder
why I quit?

12:25.544 --> 12:27.812
FATHER:
<i>Kimberly Ann Possible!</i>

12:27.814 --> 12:28.747
Hi, Dad.

12:28.749 --> 12:29.781
You know how I feel

12:29.783 --> 12:31.449
about circus folk.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.551
Actually, they're a team
of superheroes.

12:33.553 --> 12:35.253
Their archfoe
is out for revenge and...

12:35.255 --> 12:37.589
Sir, we'll get them back
to the circus pronto.

12:37.591 --> 12:38.990
See that you do, Ronald.

12:38.992 --> 12:41.292
What are we doing here?

12:41.294 --> 12:43.928
We needed to meet someplace
Aviarius doesn't know about

12:43.930 --> 12:44.929
to make our plan.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.030
Well, the Go Tower

12:46.032 --> 12:47.665
is the ultimate
fortress of goodness.

12:47.667 --> 12:49.367
Don't think so.

12:49.369 --> 12:51.369
You've got a giant viewscreen
that your archfoe can appear on

12:51.371 --> 12:52.704
whenever he wants.

12:52.706 --> 12:54.773
He talks to you,
you talk to him.

12:54.775 --> 12:55.974
You don't think...?

12:55.976 --> 12:58.743
That he could use that
technology to spy on us

12:58.745 --> 13:01.012
while we were planning
our heroic efforts?

13:01.014 --> 13:02.447
Blast! The fiend!

13:02.449 --> 13:04.716
How come no one never mentioned
this before?

13:04.718 --> 13:06.985
Because it was obvious.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.553
( <i>sighs</i> )

13:08.555 --> 13:09.754
Everybody, listen up.

13:09.756 --> 13:11.422
Here's what we should do...

13:11.424 --> 13:13.358
So it wasn't just
Hego's strength.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.926
She also got
his super-bossiness.

13:14.928 --> 13:17.295
( <i>smacking lips</i>)

13:17.297 --> 13:19.030
Ugh! There is no way
I can do this.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.532
Five minutes with my brothers

13:20.534 --> 13:22.567
and I'm ready
to claw my own eyes out.

13:22.569 --> 13:24.669
Shego, I have brothers, too.

13:24.671 --> 13:27.705
I know how annoying they can be,
but you can't walk out.

13:27.707 --> 13:29.307
Why not?

13:29.309 --> 13:31.409
Because if you don't help,
I'll tell the world

13:31.411 --> 13:32.877
you used to be a good guy.

13:32.879 --> 13:33.912
You wouldn't.

13:33.914 --> 13:34.879
I've got a Web site

13:34.881 --> 13:36.347
and I'm not afraid to use it.

13:36.349 --> 13:37.882
My reputation would be shot.

13:37.884 --> 13:39.751
( <i>groans</i> )

13:39.753 --> 13:41.953
Wade, I need a top-to-bottom
tech scan on Go Mountain.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.688
You got it, Kim.

13:43.690 --> 13:46.624
Kim, is Shego in your kitchen?

13:46.626 --> 13:48.626
Just do your computer thing,
nerdlinger.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.094
Has she always been
this cranky?

13:50.096 --> 13:51.462
BOTH:
Oh, yeah.

13:52.798 --> 13:55.066
( <i>laughing</i> )

13:55.068 --> 13:58.837
Soon, the powers of Team Go
will be mine.

13:58.839 --> 14:02.841
At long last, control of Go City
will be mine!

14:02.843 --> 14:06.911
And after so many years,
vengeance will be mine!

14:06.913 --> 14:08.980
Mine, mine, mine.

14:08.982 --> 14:11.349
He sounds like Mego.

14:12.618 --> 14:14.018
( <i>groans</i> )

14:14.020 --> 14:16.788
You know,
I do not recommend that.

14:16.790 --> 14:17.989
Good to know

14:17.991 --> 14:20.124
for when I have Hego's power.

14:20.126 --> 14:22.760
Not going to happen.

14:22.762 --> 14:25.797
Ooh, the complete set
is within reach.

14:27.499 --> 14:28.566
( <i>grunts</i> )

14:31.704 --> 14:34.138
( <i>whispering</i>):
See? Shrinking comes in handy.

14:34.140 --> 14:36.040
Super strength
is so much better.

14:38.677 --> 14:39.844
BOTH:
Thanks.

14:39.846 --> 14:40.879
I rest my case.

14:40.881 --> 14:42.847
Oh, put a sock in it.

14:42.849 --> 14:43.848
Uh, guys?

14:43.850 --> 14:45.717
( <i>screeching</i> )

14:49.822 --> 14:51.022
I'm with the big guy.

14:51.024 --> 14:52.824
Mad love for the super strength.

14:52.826 --> 14:54.792
And it must be mine!

15:02.568 --> 15:05.503
Heat-seeking hummingbirds, fly!

15:05.871 --> 15:09.107
( <i>beeping</i> )

15:09.942 --> 15:10.975
Hummingbirds?

15:21.987 --> 15:23.421

15:24.523 --> 15:25.590
Oh, no!

15:25.592 --> 15:26.658

15:40.205 --> 15:44.742
Release the Flamingo of Doom!

That is the second-biggest
flamingo I have ever seen.

Need a little help?

16:07.767 --> 16:09.067
Are you offering?

16:09.069 --> 16:11.836
I just don't want to lose
to a giant flamingo, okay?

16:11.838 --> 16:12.804
You hit him high.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.572
And you hit him low.

16:26.952 --> 16:29.887
You ladies talk too much.

16:29.889 --> 16:31.756
( <i>both moan</i> )

Go Team, go!

Oh, the red power lets you
make copies of yourself!

Ooh! Cool!

16:50.509 --> 16:52.176
( <i>cackling</i> )

17:12.798 --> 17:15.900
Yes, I have it all!

17:16.668 --> 17:17.535
We still have

17:17.537 --> 17:18.803
one thing on our side.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.304
Yeah?

17:20.306 --> 17:21.939
The power of imagination.

17:21.941 --> 17:23.274
( <i>groans</i>)

17:23.276 --> 17:24.976
Yeah, okay.
All right, you're right.

17:24.978 --> 17:25.943
We got nothing.

17:30.315 --> 17:34.052
See, this is why I hate
family reunions.

17:34.054 --> 17:38.689
From now on, Team Go is a no-go.

17:38.691 --> 17:40.658
I don't care how many
powers this jerk has.

17:40.660 --> 17:41.626
We can take him.

17:41.628 --> 17:42.660
Yeah, maybe.

But we need a distraction.

Awesome!

Finally. Now give me

Or...

Or I could have all the powers.

Shego, I thought
we were in this together.

18:34.981 --> 18:38.015
Oh, come on.
Don't you know me better by now?

18:38.017 --> 18:39.217
I mean, seriously.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.618
She's right.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.286
Keeping everyone else's power
for herself

18:42.288 --> 18:43.754
and using them for evil...

18:43.756 --> 18:45.623
yeah, that's got more
of the Shego vibe.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.191
No, I don't believe it.

18:47.193 --> 18:49.026
You may be a cranky smartmouth,

18:49.028 --> 18:52.263
prone to excessive violence,
but deep down,

18:52.265 --> 18:54.632
you are still a member
of Team Go...

18:54.634 --> 18:56.200
a hero.

18:56.202 --> 18:58.369
Hego, I quit your stupid team
years ago

18:58.371 --> 19:01.205
and after I quit, I
went to work for a guy

who wants
to take over the world.

But deep down...

19:08.247 --> 19:09.247
I am evil.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.916
Have I made myself clear?

19:11.918 --> 19:12.917
Super bad.

19:12.919 --> 19:13.951
Yeah, totally evil.

19:13.953 --> 19:15.153
Evil.

all the powers at once?

to be the distraction.

That's right, Shego.

Kim Possible's computer kid
told me

20:29.829 --> 20:32.063
how you were at the mercy
of a villain.

Where is this Aviarius?

20:34.100 --> 20:35.266
Here he is.

20:35.268 --> 20:37.501
Dude, Drakken knows who I am.

20:37.503 --> 20:41.105
Yes, the name escapes me,
but I do know

20:41.107 --> 20:42.807
the air of buffoonery.

20:42.809 --> 20:44.175
Dr. D, I've got everything
under control here.

20:44.177 --> 20:46.877
KIM:
Not so much.

20:46.879 --> 20:47.745
( <i>gasps</i> )

20:55.854 --> 20:58.422
Go Team, go!

20:58.424 --> 21:00.825
Get us out of here, fast.

21:00.827 --> 21:01.959
DRAKKEN:
Can do.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.060
And don't worry, Shego.

21:03.062 --> 21:04.762
You can thank me later.

21:08.767 --> 21:10.968
Looks like this bird
is ready for his cage.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.536
( <i>laughs</i>)

21:12.538 --> 21:15.473
Do you have to say that
every time you capture me?

21:15.475 --> 21:17.842
RON:
<i>I don't understand.</i>

21:17.844 --> 21:20.044
How can you not have
the Naco on the menu?

21:20.046 --> 21:21.846
The Naco didn't test well.

21:21.848 --> 21:23.347
Test? What test?

21:23.349 --> 21:25.850
Ten randomly-selected
customers taste-tested

21:25.852 --> 21:28.052
current and future menu items.

21:28.054 --> 21:29.787
The Mexi Mushroom Wrap...

21:29.789 --> 21:30.888
huge.

21:30.890 --> 21:33.090
Wraps? That's the future
of Bueno Nacho?

21:33.092 --> 21:34.925
Ugh!
Let me talk to these people.

21:34.927 --> 21:36.927
I'm the one who's been saying,
all along,

21:36.929 --> 21:38.095
we never should've quit.

21:38.097 --> 21:39.063
Being back together...

21:39.065 --> 21:40.031
has been fun.

21:40.033 --> 21:41.565
That's what I'm saying.

21:41.567 --> 21:44.101
But we should reconsider
who the team leader is.

21:44.103 --> 21:45.303
If you ask me...

21:45.305 --> 21:47.071
Boy, it sounds like it got ugly.

21:47.073 --> 21:49.073
Do you really think Shego
would have gone through with it?

21:49.075 --> 21:50.808
We're talking about Shego?

21:50.810 --> 21:52.877
But I got to say
it was pretty easy

21:52.879 --> 21:54.845
to get that power staff
from her.

21:54.847 --> 21:56.881
DRAKKEN:
<i>I mean, really,</i>

21:56.883 --> 21:58.883
you practically gave it to her.

21:58.885 --> 21:59.850
Whatever.

21:59.852 --> 22:01.252
Now that I know the whole story,

22:01.254 --> 22:03.954
I think you secretly
wanted to lose.

22:03.956 --> 22:04.622
What?

22:04.624 --> 22:06.023
That's right.

22:06.025 --> 22:07.925
You wanted your brothers
to get their powers back.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.927
You don't really have it in you
to betray them.

22:09.929 --> 22:11.962
Are you saying
that I am going soft?

22:11.964 --> 22:14.031
As a marshmallow.

22:14.033 --> 22:15.933
( <i>growls</i> )

22:15.935 --> 22:17.501
Shego, I take it back!

22:17.503 --> 22:20.104
You're not a softy!
Shego!
