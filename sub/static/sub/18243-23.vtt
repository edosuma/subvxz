10:54.741 --> 10:56.568
But I don't really
feel like it.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.440
Excuse me, girls.

10:58.527 --> 11:00.616
I left some of
Terri's talking points
in the car.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.187
You know,
on second thought,

11:06.274 --> 11:08.711
it might be a good exercise
for Terri to wing it.

11:08.798 --> 11:10.844
Hey,
would you mind grabbing me
a smoothie from Mama P's?

11:10.931 --> 11:13.585
Actually, we're
staying in tonight.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.805
- Sorry.
- No worries.

11:15.892 --> 11:18.939
Just let me know if you
change your minds. Again.

11:20.984 --> 11:22.159
I think the spell
went wonky.

11:22.246 --> 11:23.683
It's like
no one can leave.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.989
[lock clicking]

11:26.076 --> 11:27.643
Oh, that's not good.

11:27.730 --> 11:30.646
The recipe
was supposed to
keep people out.

11:30.733 --> 11:32.039
[cell phone rings]

11:32.126 --> 11:33.214
Becky: Hello.

11:33.301 --> 11:35.390
This is Rebecca Quinn.

11:35.477 --> 11:38.262
[sighs] I left my
credit card there.

11:38.349 --> 11:40.482
Okay, I'll be
right back to get it.

11:40.569 --> 11:41.962
Thank you.

11:42.049 --> 11:44.834
[sighs]

11:44.921 --> 11:47.837
The spell is definitely
keeping people out,

11:47.924 --> 11:49.360
but why can't we leave?

11:49.447 --> 11:51.101
Oh, no.

11:51.188 --> 11:53.756
We were in such a rush
to put the wall up
around the house

11:53.843 --> 11:55.671
that we didn't
think this through.

11:55.758 --> 11:57.673
Walls work two ways.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.676
No one in... or out.

12:00.763 --> 12:03.723
So we're trapped in the house
with some crazy ex protector.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.123
[sighs]
Teleporting Tacos,

12:13.210 --> 12:14.777
Walk Through Wall-ffles.

12:14.864 --> 12:17.345
There are so many spells
that could help us escape.

12:17.432 --> 12:20.043
Except all of our spices
are outside in the trailer.

12:20.130 --> 12:21.915
It's kind of like we're
in that scary movie,

12:22.002 --> 12:23.003
"Shush."

12:23.090 --> 12:24.178
Scary movies
give me nightmares.

12:24.265 --> 12:26.223
But it's so good.

12:26.310 --> 12:28.530
It's about this mime
who traps these kids
in a funhouse,

12:28.617 --> 12:30.706
and they can't
get out and--

12:30.793 --> 12:32.752
Oh, I just remember
how it ends.

12:32.839 --> 12:36.146
Oh, that won't be us.
We have magic.

12:36.233 --> 12:38.279
Kind of.

12:38.366 --> 12:39.671
Here's another one.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.891
Tear Down Tomato Soup.

12:41.978 --> 12:44.154
Could tear down
the wall around the house.

12:44.241 --> 12:46.243
Wait,
let me see that.

12:46.330 --> 12:49.725
The recipe calls for
lapsis cayenne
and werepos basil.

12:49.812 --> 12:52.293
Which we have.
In the trailer.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.774
We have them
right here.

12:54.861 --> 12:57.037
In the Raise the Wall
Roasted Tomatoes.

12:57.124 --> 12:58.647
They're both
tomato recipes

12:58.734 --> 13:01.128
that use the same
magic spices.

13:01.215 --> 13:03.086
If we cook this
into a soup...

13:03.173 --> 13:06.263
We can transform
one magic recipe
into another.

13:06.350 --> 13:07.656
Hannah, you're a genius.

13:07.743 --> 13:09.440
Well, tell that to
Mr. Morris.

13:09.527 --> 13:12.792
We can't cook in the kitchen
with Morris in the living room.

13:12.879 --> 13:15.185
Actually,
we might not have to.

13:15.272 --> 13:17.884
I have an idea.
It's in the garage.

13:19.059 --> 13:20.190
Here it is.

13:20.277 --> 13:21.670
Is that an old
quick-bake oven?

13:21.757 --> 13:24.499
It's no stove top,
but the light bulb in this

13:24.586 --> 13:26.631
definitely gets hot enough
to make soup.

13:26.718 --> 13:29.330
I know.
I used to have one of these
when I was little.

13:29.417 --> 13:32.072
I accidentally melted
Hailey's favorite hair brush.

13:32.159 --> 13:34.074
Accidentally?

13:34.161 --> 13:36.772
Okay, once Darbie grabs
the non-magical ingredients,

13:36.859 --> 13:37.817
we'll be all set.

13:45.346 --> 13:46.956
Darbie, right?

13:47.043 --> 13:50.177
Yeah. You need something
from the fridge?

13:50.264 --> 13:51.743
No. Could you grab
your friends?

13:51.831 --> 13:53.223
What for?

13:53.310 --> 13:55.225
We could use your help
in the living room.

13:55.312 --> 13:59.882
Oh, sure.
We'd love to hang out with
Mrs. Quinn and Jill and you.

14:01.275 --> 14:02.406
Thank you.

14:05.322 --> 14:07.020
Terri: Thanks so much
for helping out.

14:07.107 --> 14:08.804
Kelly: Of course, Mom.
What's up?

14:08.891 --> 14:11.024
We've been discussing
Terri's education policy,

14:11.111 --> 14:13.156
and Arthur had
an excellent idea.

14:13.243 --> 14:14.549
I'm sure he did.

14:14.636 --> 14:15.942
We want to help
our schools,

14:16.029 --> 14:17.552
but we haven't actually
asked any students

14:17.639 --> 14:18.858
what they think
the problems are.

14:18.945 --> 14:21.599
Easy. School meals
should be organic.

14:21.686 --> 14:23.340
Instead, they
over season everything

14:23.427 --> 14:25.212
to hide the fact that
they use cheap food.

14:25.299 --> 14:27.867
That's actually
a smart way to save money.

14:27.954 --> 14:29.869
Not that I endorse
shortcuts.

14:29.956 --> 14:32.132
I wouldn't have thought
that was an issue with
students.

14:32.219 --> 14:34.830
Although with you,
I probably should have.

14:34.917 --> 14:36.614
I think we should have
enough time

14:36.701 --> 14:39.008
to do our homework
in school.

14:39.095 --> 14:41.489
Mm, not sure it would be
homework then.

14:41.576 --> 14:43.752
I know, it's just...

14:43.839 --> 14:45.754
I'm really tired
when I get home.

14:45.841 --> 14:47.408
I used high school as
a way to catch up on sleep.

14:47.495 --> 14:48.713
[chuckling]

14:48.800 --> 14:51.194
- [cell phone buzzing]
- Excuse me.

14:51.281 --> 14:54.589
What about you, Hannah.
What's the biggest problem
facing students?

14:54.676 --> 14:57.287
Honestly, I think it's
the teachers.

14:57.374 --> 14:59.550
Some of them
don't seem trustworthy.

14:59.637 --> 15:00.595
Or competent.

15:02.075 --> 15:04.773
Sorry.
The delivery guy's lost.

15:04.860 --> 15:06.427
He was here the other day,
now he can't find us?

15:06.514 --> 15:08.081
That's odd.

15:08.168 --> 15:11.214
You know
those new driving apps
all have bugs in them.

15:11.301 --> 15:13.608
He's lucky he didn't end up
in Lavender Heights.

15:13.695 --> 15:15.479
Well, uh, I'm starved.

15:15.566 --> 15:17.003
Maybe we can have
some of that tart, Arthur?

15:17.090 --> 15:18.352
Okay.

15:18.439 --> 15:20.615
Darbie:
Uh, we can't eat that.

15:20.702 --> 15:24.097
It'll spoil our appetite.

15:24.184 --> 15:27.274
Something tells me you'll
still have room for dinner.

15:27.361 --> 15:29.406
I think you'll all
really like it.

15:29.493 --> 15:31.887
I made it from
an old recipe.

15:39.068 --> 15:40.374
- Mm.
- Mm, this is
really good.

15:40.461 --> 15:42.376
Thank you.

15:42.463 --> 15:44.465
You should
give Kelly the recipe.
She's quite the cook.

15:44.552 --> 15:46.467
All the girls are
fantastic, actually.

15:46.554 --> 15:48.686
- Is that so?
- We're okay.

15:48.773 --> 15:50.210
Um, may we please
be excused?

15:50.297 --> 15:51.254
Are you sure
you don't want some?

15:51.341 --> 15:52.603
We're waiting
for dinner.

15:52.690 --> 15:54.431
And we want to get
our homework done.

15:54.518 --> 15:56.825
Who does homework
on a Saturday night?

15:56.912 --> 15:59.175
Uh-- I'm sorry.
You're right.

15:59.262 --> 16:00.872
Always good to get
a jump on things.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.049
Especially with this week's
ethics essay, Hannah.

16:03.136 --> 16:06.008
It's complicated,
but I'm sure if you
take your time,

16:06.095 --> 16:07.227
you'll figure it out.

16:07.314 --> 16:09.142
Thank you, Mr. Morris.

16:09.229 --> 16:10.143
You are very helpful.

16:14.364 --> 16:16.192
Did Morris just spell
your mom and Jill?

16:16.279 --> 16:17.933
- I don't know.
We need to get--
- Look.

16:19.239 --> 16:20.675
Someone smashed
the cooking bulb.

16:20.762 --> 16:22.111
Now the oven is useless.

16:22.198 --> 16:23.417
Morris must have
snuck in here

16:23.504 --> 16:24.635
when he went to
go get his tart.

16:24.722 --> 16:26.289
This is just like
in "Shush."

16:26.376 --> 16:29.814
You know, when the mime
puts everyone in a box,
and--

16:29.901 --> 16:31.816
and-- and they all had
a good laugh,

16:31.903 --> 16:32.948
'cause nothin' bad
happened.

16:36.082 --> 16:37.735
Mr. Morris took
the tomatoes, too.

16:39.215 --> 16:41.130
Now we're really
out of spices.

16:41.217 --> 16:42.697
Okay, that settles it.

16:42.784 --> 16:43.872
We need to put
a secret spice pantry
in the house.

16:43.959 --> 16:46.092
Everyone else has one.

16:46.179 --> 16:48.703
That's it.
We need to use the spices
from Mama P's pantry.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.052
How?

16:50.139 --> 16:51.923
Jake can't
bring them to us.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.882
But Jake can cook
with them.

16:53.969 --> 16:56.450
We can talk him through
making a spell
to get us out of here.

16:57.929 --> 16:59.279
You guys really think
I can do this?

16:59.366 --> 17:00.845
I mean, I know I'm
a good chef but--

17:00.932 --> 17:02.891
Kelly: Yes, Jake,
we really do.

17:02.978 --> 17:04.935
You're also
the only person left
who knows about magic.

17:06.502 --> 17:08.505
And you're
a really great chef.

17:08.592 --> 17:10.420
Okay. I found
the lapsis cayenne.

17:10.507 --> 17:11.421
Now what?

17:14.685 --> 17:15.643
Oh, no.

17:17.992 --> 17:19.429
There's a bag of
kale chips in here.

17:19.516 --> 17:21.736
The ones Mama P makes?
I love those.

17:21.823 --> 17:23.346
Yeah, so does Mayor Davies.

17:23.433 --> 17:24.781
And if they're hidden
in the pantry--

17:24.868 --> 17:27.262
They're probably magical.

17:27.349 --> 17:29.135
Mama P must have made these

17:29.222 --> 17:32.660
but then forgot about them
when she was cursed.

17:32.747 --> 17:33.878
Hannah: Mama P
using magic is bad,

17:33.965 --> 17:36.185
but we kind of have
a bigger problem.

17:36.272 --> 17:38.840
You don't get it.
They're for the mayor,
and they're magic--

17:40.668 --> 17:42.539
What was I talking about?

17:42.626 --> 17:45.238
- Something about
magic kale chips.
- Magic.

17:45.325 --> 17:46.413
I mean,
I know these are good,

17:46.500 --> 17:48.067
but I wouldn't
call them magic.

17:48.154 --> 17:50.330
Oh, no, Jake.

17:50.417 --> 17:51.896
Not you, too.

17:51.983 --> 17:53.289
What's wrong?

17:53.376 --> 17:56.858
Please tell us
you remember magic.

17:56.945 --> 17:58.077
Huh?

17:58.164 --> 17:59.904
What are you
talking about?

17:59.991 --> 18:02.211
Nothing, Jake,
we'll--

18:02.298 --> 18:03.560
we'll let you
get back to work.

18:03.647 --> 18:05.214
Thanks.
We're slammed.

18:05.301 --> 18:06.694
And Mama P is
too busy gossiping

18:06.781 --> 18:08.609
with Mayor Davies
to help me.

18:10.567 --> 18:12.874
It's not fair.
Jake never hurt anyone.

18:12.961 --> 18:14.528
He's not even a protector.

18:14.615 --> 18:16.834
Do you think
Morris cursed him

18:16.921 --> 18:19.663
because he's
our friend?

18:19.750 --> 18:21.796
I don't know,
but we need to stop him.

18:21.883 --> 18:23.406
How?

18:23.493 --> 18:24.842
I'm out of ideas.

18:24.929 --> 18:27.802
I-- I think we lost.

18:33.808 --> 18:35.157
What have you been
doing back there?

18:35.244 --> 18:36.941
Table number three
needs to be bused.

18:37.028 --> 18:38.421
Where'd you find those?

18:38.508 --> 18:39.770
In the back,
I think.

18:39.857 --> 18:41.990
Great. I told the mayor
we were out.

18:53.262 --> 18:54.785
Well, I'm not gonna
sit around

18:54.872 --> 18:57.048
and wait for Morris
to curse us.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.442
So you have a plan that
involves Kelly's closet?

18:59.529 --> 19:01.836
I'm going to make a video
for my future self

19:01.923 --> 19:03.446
reminding her of magic.

19:03.533 --> 19:06.232
If anyone can convince me
magic exists,

19:06.319 --> 19:07.233
it's me.

19:12.107 --> 19:14.065
Okay, listen up,
future Darbie,

19:14.153 --> 19:16.720
because I am about to
blow your mind.

19:16.807 --> 19:18.853
Magic is totally real,

19:18.940 --> 19:20.376
and it is awesome.

19:20.463 --> 19:21.986
Here's what you need to know
about the magic:

19:22.073 --> 19:23.771
It's nothing but trouble.

19:23.858 --> 19:26.774
Kelly,
if you're watching this,

19:26.861 --> 19:29.080
it means that
you have forgotten.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.691
Magic is real.

19:30.778 --> 19:32.519
We've used it
to help people.

19:32.606 --> 19:36.566
...to read minds,
to conquer our fears,
to travel in time.

19:36.653 --> 19:38.655
Yeah, time travel.

19:38.742 --> 19:40.440
We saved Grandma,

19:40.527 --> 19:42.485
we helped Miss Silvers
play in public,

19:42.572 --> 19:44.835
we saved all of Saffron Falls
from a curse.

19:44.922 --> 19:46.489
It's put us in
dangerous situations

19:46.576 --> 19:48.317
that haven't always worked
the way we wanted.

19:50.363 --> 19:53.583
It's also the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

19:53.670 --> 19:56.412
Because it's brought me
closer together to
my two best friends.

19:56.499 --> 20:00.373
And by we, I mean me,
Hannah, and Darbie.

20:00.460 --> 20:02.026
The greatest part
about magic

20:02.113 --> 20:04.203
was that I got to do it
with Kelly and Hannah.

20:04.290 --> 20:07.771
It doesn't matter if you
remember magic or not.

20:07.858 --> 20:11.688
All that matters
is that I don't forget
Kelly and Darbie.

20:11.775 --> 20:12.820
We made a great team.

20:22.830 --> 20:25.528
You know,
I've been thinking about
what you said about Terri.

20:25.615 --> 20:28.531
Hm. What's that?

20:28.618 --> 20:32.492
How Terri's proven herself
in such a short time.

20:32.579 --> 20:35.930
She has perspective that
Lever doesn't have,

20:36.017 --> 20:38.715
given all his years
as a councilman.

20:38.802 --> 20:40.543
He does have experience,

20:40.630 --> 20:42.241
which is a good thing
for a mayor.

20:42.328 --> 20:46.027
Surely Terri's experience
running the Quinn home

20:46.114 --> 20:49.248
qualifies her to run
the entire town
of Saffron Falls.

20:50.553 --> 20:53.643
You know,
I'm not sure I agree.

20:53.730 --> 20:55.558
I know you support Terri.

20:55.645 --> 20:56.777
Completely.

20:56.864 --> 20:59.780
But I'm starting
to have doubts.

20:59.867 --> 21:01.390
I have a lot
to think about.

21:01.477 --> 21:02.870
Really? I--

21:02.957 --> 21:04.350
I mean, of course.

21:14.795 --> 21:16.231
We must remember
our history.

21:16.318 --> 21:17.754
It's what makes us special.

21:17.841 --> 21:19.365
As mayor of
Saffron Falls,

21:19.452 --> 21:22.455
I'll preserve that heritage
for future generations.

21:22.542 --> 21:26.154
I promise I will never
let us forget who we are.

21:26.241 --> 21:28.591
- Nice job, Mrs. Q.
- I liked it.

21:28.678 --> 21:31.115
I'd vote for you
even if you weren't my mom.

21:31.202 --> 21:33.117
Or if I was
old enough to vote.

21:33.204 --> 21:34.771
It's a very eloquent speech
for the debate.

21:34.858 --> 21:37.034
Thank you.
Jill, notes?

21:37.121 --> 21:39.298
Honestly,

21:39.385 --> 21:41.256
it was good,
but it can be better.

21:41.343 --> 21:43.302
I wasn't
completely feeling it.

21:43.389 --> 21:45.304
It's like you put up a wall
between you and the audience.

21:45.391 --> 21:46.696
Really?
I thought I was
getting better

21:46.783 --> 21:47.871
as a public speaker.

21:47.958 --> 21:49.003
Oh, you are.

21:49.090 --> 21:50.874
But you need to
drop your guard

21:50.961 --> 21:53.703
or you'll never
get through to people.

21:53.790 --> 21:55.270
That's a great idea, Jill.

21:56.924 --> 21:59.056
You want us to
come clean with Morris?

21:59.143 --> 22:00.841
- No way.
- How will that help?

22:00.928 --> 22:02.103
What if the barrier spell
is like

22:02.190 --> 22:03.583
the secret spell I cast?

22:03.670 --> 22:05.324
Everyone kept telling me
their secrets--

22:05.411 --> 22:07.674
Until you told
one of your secrets.

22:07.761 --> 22:10.024
Maybe the magic wall
guarding the house
won't come down

22:10.111 --> 22:13.332
until we drop our guards
with Mr. Morris.

22:13.419 --> 22:17.292
Well... Morris is
onto us anyway.

22:17.379 --> 22:18.598
Can't hurt to try.

22:18.685 --> 22:19.642
Let's go.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.257
Mr. Morris.
We need to talk.

22:28.390 --> 22:29.652
We know you
sabotaged our oven.

22:29.739 --> 22:31.306
We know you know
about magic.

22:31.393 --> 22:33.352
And we know you're here
to take the cookbook.

22:36.180 --> 22:38.661
Yes.
I came here to take
the cookbook,

22:38.748 --> 22:40.707
because I didn't think that
you were worthy protectors.

22:40.794 --> 22:42.752
And tonight,
you proved me right.

22:42.839 --> 22:45.712
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We're way better protectors
than your trio.

22:45.799 --> 22:48.671
And the OCs.
And definitely Chuck.

22:48.758 --> 22:49.759
[door opens]

22:49.846 --> 22:52.283
So sorry I'm late.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.329
I kept getting delayed,

22:54.416 --> 22:58.202
and then I ran into this
very confused delivery boy
outside.

22:58.289 --> 22:59.595
Hi, Grandma,
we'll be right in.

22:59.682 --> 23:01.292
Terri: Finally,
food's here.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.251
- Where are you going?
- To get away from you three.

23:03.338 --> 23:04.905
Us? What did we do?

23:04.992 --> 23:06.733
You trapped me here tonight
with a barrier spell.

23:06.820 --> 23:09.126
We were trying to
keep you out.

23:09.213 --> 23:10.389
You're the one
that brought over

23:10.476 --> 23:12.434
a magical fruit tart
to curse us.

23:12.521 --> 23:15.219
Magic fruit?
No, no, it was just
a fruit tart.

23:15.306 --> 23:17.352
There's no way
a non-magical fruit tart

23:17.439 --> 23:18.440
smells that good.

23:18.527 --> 23:20.877
Admit it.
In the garage,

23:20.964 --> 23:22.923
you were going to
cook a spell to curse me.

23:23.010 --> 23:24.794
Huh? No.

23:24.881 --> 23:26.143
You know,
I used to think
that you three

23:26.230 --> 23:27.580
were just reckless.

23:27.667 --> 23:29.756
Now I know
you're dangerous.

23:29.843 --> 23:31.453
Because we made
the barrier spell?

23:31.540 --> 23:34.369
We did that because
we were scared of you.

23:34.456 --> 23:35.501
Scared of me?

23:35.588 --> 23:37.067
[scoffs]
You are the ones

23:37.154 --> 23:39.896
cursing everyone in town
to forget magic.

23:42.246 --> 23:44.945
Wait. What?
