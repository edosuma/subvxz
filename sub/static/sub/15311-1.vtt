01:03.073 --> 01:06.244
There is a non-malignant mass
in the upper lobe of the left lung

01:06.279 --> 01:07.634
that needs to be resected.

01:07.635 --> 01:10.815
I have elected to perform
the procedure thoracoscopically

01:10.850 --> 01:13.754
rather than employing a
more traditional thoracotomy.

01:13.756 --> 01:15.957
This will add an extra hour
to the procedure,

01:15.959 --> 01:18.926
but it will significantly
reduce the recovery time.

01:19.011 --> 01:20.878
Dr. Sanders! How does it feel
to be responsible

01:20.880 --> 01:23.263
for the life of the President
of the United States?

01:23.515 --> 01:25.967
His life is no more important
than any of my patients'.

01:25.969 --> 01:29.303
Which is to say, it's the most
important thing in the world.

01:29.805 --> 01:30.938
Thank you, everyone.

01:31.573 --> 01:34.759
I think I am in
very capable hands.

01:43.535 --> 01:46.603
You're a genius, sir.
This puts you way out front on health care,

01:46.605 --> 01:49.330
makes you bulletproof for
the Patients' Rights groups,

01:49.365 --> 01:52.243
and women voters are
gonna love this lady doctor.

01:52.311 --> 01:55.612
Glad to know you care so much
about my health, Quentin.

02:08.193 --> 02:11.012
Stay down!
I'm not gonna tell you again!

02:11.480 --> 02:14.465
- Please!
- Shut up!

02:15.584 --> 02:18.519
Hey, man. What are we gonna do?
The cops are gatherin' an army out there!

02:18.521 --> 02:20.788
They're not gonna make a move as
long as we have the hostages.

02:21.236 --> 02:23.278
<i>Redman,
do you have your target?</i>

02:23.313 --> 02:24.842
<i>Redman, 2-1, affirmative.</i>

02:24.910 --> 02:26.394
Look, all I'm saying...

02:29.481 --> 02:30.781
Stay down! Shut up!

02:31.483 --> 02:32.583
Right, let's go. Let's go!

02:32.585 --> 02:34.135
Who gave that order?

02:34.137 --> 02:36.203
Who gave the order to shoot?

02:38.924 --> 02:39.957
I did.

02:39.959 --> 02:41.258
Who the hell are you?

02:41.826 --> 02:43.210
The agent in charge now.

02:43.212 --> 02:45.179
I was about to open a line of
communication to start negotiations.

02:45.181 --> 02:47.131
Thanks.
I'll take it from here.

02:47.749 --> 02:49.266
You lying cop son-of-a-bitch!

02:49.268 --> 02:52.053
I told you if one single policeman
tried something funny...

02:52.055 --> 02:54.438
The police are no longer
in charge.

02:54.607 --> 02:58.886
I'm FBI Special Agent Duncan Carlisle
and from this point on,

02:58.921 --> 03:03.197
I am your last, best and only chance of
you walking out of that bank alive today.

03:03.199 --> 03:05.649
I have 13 hostages!
I demand safe transport.

03:05.651 --> 03:08.285
I'll tell you what.
Release a dozen hostages.

03:08.287 --> 03:10.607
And then we'll talk
about your safe transport.

03:10.648 --> 03:11.922
How's that sound?

03:11.957 --> 03:13.012
<i>What?</i>

03:13.047 --> 03:14.492
You got five minutes.

03:26.538 --> 03:29.473
<i>Ready 2-1,
tight on subject.</i>

03:31.793 --> 03:33.811
You're okay,
you're okay, keep going!

03:33.813 --> 03:35.546
- You're safe now. Keep moving.
- Keep going.

03:35.548 --> 03:38.349
<i>That's all the hostages free except one.
I kept my end of the deal.</i>

03:38.351 --> 03:39.850
<i>Where's my transport?</i>

03:40.185 --> 03:41.519
Pull it up.

03:47.659 --> 03:49.226
<i>Okay. I'm coming out.</i>

03:49.228 --> 03:52.129
<i>Everybody stay back
or this guy's a dead man.</i>

03:52.914 --> 03:54.698
<i>Rifle, 2-1, in command.</i>

04:10.549 --> 04:13.867
Hey! Hold it right there!

04:16.887 --> 04:18.522
He shot the wrong guy!

04:21.259 --> 04:22.443
Take it off.

04:25.947 --> 04:28.599
He switched places
with the hostage.

04:29.985 --> 04:31.735
Boots didn't match his suit.

04:32.354 --> 04:33.871
You shot a man based on that.

04:34.456 --> 04:35.990
What if you'd been wrong?

04:37.793 --> 04:38.942
I wasn't.

04:45.616 --> 04:47.949
My department chief is resentful.

04:48.019 --> 04:50.128
He thinks the White House only chose me
because I'm a woman.

04:50.166 --> 04:51.825
Your department chief
has sewn more sponges

04:51.924 --> 04:56.093
into his patients than stitches.
He's a bureaucrat! You are a rock star.

04:56.095 --> 04:57.728
Embrace your greatness, Ellen.

05:29.427 --> 05:30.994
Hey, honey, how are you?

05:30.996 --> 05:33.013
<i>Uh, exhausted.</i>

05:33.916 --> 05:36.767
- I'm sorry I couldn't be there.
- Yeah, yeah, of course.

05:36.769 --> 05:38.435
I understand.

05:39.288 --> 05:42.306
You know how hard I've been working
on the sale of this Hausman building.

05:42.441 --> 05:45.943
<i>Yeah, I, I know, it's fine.
I understand.</i>

05:50.115 --> 05:54.134
So how was the
press conference?

05:54.486 --> 05:57.521
It was nothing, really.
I mean, I barely had to speak...

05:58.056 --> 06:01.091
I was thinking I might come home
early and make dinner tonight.

06:01.743 --> 06:03.694
Well, you know
I'm coaching lacrosse?

06:03.946 --> 06:08.982
Oh... Well, I guess
I'll see you after.

06:10.218 --> 06:12.369
Okay, honey. I love you.

06:27.719 --> 06:29.720
This will be an
in-and-out operation,

06:29.722 --> 06:31.789
fully compartmentalized.

06:33.224 --> 06:36.176
I.D. by code number only
for the next 24 hours.

06:36.284 --> 06:37.832
I'm Three. You're Four.

06:37.867 --> 06:39.280
I'm a four?

06:39.332 --> 06:42.833
You're a ten, honey, that's why
it's such a clever code name.

06:43.868 --> 06:47.338
Hey. Do you trust this guy
we're working for?

06:48.623 --> 06:50.291
With my life.

07:13.949 --> 07:16.495
Hey, Dolores.
How's she doing today?

07:16.530 --> 07:18.361
The chemo's hard on your wife.

07:18.400 --> 07:22.200
But she always looks a little more
peaceful to me after your visits.

07:36.404 --> 07:37.621
Hi, Nina.

07:38.890 --> 07:42.809
I promise you. Everything's gonna
go back just the way it was.

07:58.159 --> 07:59.360
Got picture.

08:20.899 --> 08:23.333
The target is on site.
You have to move now.

08:31.860 --> 08:33.643
Anybody home?

08:42.486 --> 08:45.039
C'mere! Hey, you!
What's going on?

08:45.874 --> 08:47.674
Okay, c'mon, I know
what you want.

08:48.159 --> 08:50.027
Yeah, I know what you want!

08:50.361 --> 08:52.246
Here we go, good boy.

09:01.723 --> 09:04.892
<i>Morgan? Are you home?</i>

09:10.281 --> 09:11.465
Morgan?

09:12.517 --> 09:14.718
- Oh.
- Hey. How was your day?

09:16.104 --> 09:18.238
Not as exciting as yours.

09:18.273 --> 09:21.775
- It was just a press conference.
- With the President.

09:24.496 --> 09:27.781
Around the horn! That's it.

09:28.783 --> 09:31.201
Keep it rotating!
Stay in your position. Hey!

09:31.203 --> 09:32.419
There you go. Nice.

09:35.173 --> 09:36.590
Everybody, listen up!

09:37.759 --> 09:41.545
I found this in one of the
equipment lockers...

09:42.380 --> 09:44.697
Does anybody know who it
belongs to?

09:46.551 --> 09:48.886
Look, I don't get paid to
be here,

09:48.888 --> 09:52.255
so either someone speaks up
or I go to the school

09:52.257 --> 09:54.257
and the whole team
gets punished.

09:55.477 --> 09:56.993
It's mine.

09:57.395 --> 09:58.762
Ours.

10:00.865 --> 10:05.719
It's beer money.
We took up a collection, for a party.

10:07.155 --> 10:08.788
That's an awful lot of beer.

10:09.707 --> 10:11.942
We were also
gonna buy fake I.D.'s.

10:19.000 --> 10:24.521
Kevin, I'm going to have to talk
to your parents. Jake... Come on.

10:26.591 --> 10:27.991
Why did you say that?

10:28.292 --> 10:30.626
Beats the truth, bro.

10:34.782 --> 10:36.883
Sawyer, can you please
walk with Daddy?

10:38.319 --> 10:41.905
Come on, Soy-Soy, don't you
want to see Grandpa?

10:42.774 --> 10:44.241
I packed you a bunch
of nice dresses...

10:45.360 --> 10:49.545
I don't want those.
I want my red Hello Kitty dress!

10:50.248 --> 10:52.532
When is Mommy coming home?

10:53.317 --> 10:55.001
I want Mommy.

10:57.205 --> 11:00.490
Mommy needs to rest, honey.
So she can get better.

11:03.962 --> 11:06.246
- Grandpa!
- Sweetheart!

11:11.886 --> 11:13.554
I went to go see her today.

11:14.305 --> 11:16.523
You sure you want to do this?

11:17.892 --> 11:19.560
I already am.

11:24.032 --> 11:30.720
- Oh. I love you, Soy-Soy.
- I love you, too, Daddy.

11:31.456 --> 11:34.291
- I'm gonna see you soon, okay?
- Okay.

11:44.702 --> 11:45.886
Hey, guys!

11:47.222 --> 11:48.371
Hey, Mom.

11:48.373 --> 11:49.372
How's practice?

11:49.374 --> 11:52.175
What are you doing home?
Did you get fired?

11:52.477 --> 11:55.729
I came home early to cook dinner.
Is that so unusual?

11:55.731 --> 12:00.651
Uh, yeah. Barkley! Barkley!

12:00.653 --> 12:02.652
Oh, I let him out back.

12:04.072 --> 12:05.772
Here we go.

12:07.692 --> 12:08.892
What?

12:09.744 --> 12:11.711
Are you gonna tell your mother
or should I?

12:14.082 --> 12:19.652
Kevin and Jake took up a collection
for fake I.D.'s and alcohol.

12:20.838 --> 12:24.574
Beer. We were gonna buy beer.

12:27.578 --> 12:30.913
I'm grounding him.
For two weeks.

12:34.552 --> 12:36.520
<i>This is Two.
I'm on my way with Number One.</i>

12:36.522 --> 12:39.890
Copy that, Two. Three and Four are
already in position. Standing by.

13:04.132 --> 13:05.299
Hey, Amelia.

13:06.267 --> 13:09.252
<i>Your eyes are all puffy.
You've been crying again.</i>

13:09.454 --> 13:12.232
You're so perceptive.
You should be a detective.

13:12.267 --> 13:14.542
<i>Are you gonna talk to Boyd?</i>

13:14.577 --> 13:17.894
No. God, no.

13:18.162 --> 13:20.113
<i>You've got to tell him.</i>

13:21.516 --> 13:26.069
Let me do that. You need to relax.
You've got a big day tomorrow.

13:26.704 --> 13:28.504
You could use a shower.

13:28.940 --> 13:32.025
- Hey. Where are you going?
- Out.

13:32.243 --> 13:35.095
I planned a family dinner.
I'm making pasta primavera.

13:35.146 --> 13:36.530
So save me some.

13:36.532 --> 13:39.700
Morgan. Your mother wants to spend
some quality time together.

13:39.702 --> 13:41.885
Does it even count
as "quality time" if it's compulsory?

13:41.887 --> 13:44.304
- You're staying...
- It's not that important.

13:55.166 --> 13:57.217
<i>This is Two arriving on site.</i>

13:57.853 --> 14:01.037
<i>- This is Three. Go ahead.
- Confirm that all targets are in the home.</i>

14:01.189 --> 14:03.073
Copy that.
Targets are in place.

14:03.125 --> 14:05.442
<i>Stand by for the order to go
from Number One.</i>

14:07.528 --> 14:11.681
- Are you ready?
- Let's do it.

14:34.774 --> 14:37.275
This is Number One.
We're at the fence.

14:37.277 --> 14:40.061
Hold up, we got a problem.

14:41.364 --> 14:42.897
The girl just left the house.

14:45.451 --> 14:47.068
<i>What's the call, Number One?</i>

14:47.471 --> 14:51.356
Operation is still a go.
Tell Number Four to follow the girl.

15:04.303 --> 15:08.423
<i>Hey, yo, Jake, I'll see you tonight.
And you'd better have my money.</i>

15:15.147 --> 15:18.266
Hey. Nico wants his cash.
Tonight.

15:18.268 --> 15:20.118
<i>What? Did you tell him
we don't have it?</i>

15:20.120 --> 15:23.989
Kevin. The guy took a baseball bat to
some college kid who tried to stiff him

15:23.991 --> 15:26.157
for 200 bucks worth of weed.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.443
Now, do you want to tell him we
lost his twelve hundred dollars?

15:28.445 --> 15:29.827
<i>We are so dead.</i>

15:29.980 --> 15:33.314
Well, just start figuring out
where we can get the money...

15:35.118 --> 15:36.451
Barkley!

15:42.475 --> 15:43.641
I got the dog.

16:15.925 --> 16:18.026
She met up with her boyfriend.

16:20.829 --> 16:22.513
What do you want me to do?

16:22.631 --> 16:23.498
<i>Stop her.</i>

16:23.500 --> 16:24.682
Copy that.

16:29.522 --> 16:32.507
I don't like the idea of you
walking here in the dark.

16:33.609 --> 16:36.194
Why can't I just pick you up
closer to your house?

16:37.446 --> 16:38.613
Don't start.

16:43.685 --> 16:47.789
If you'd just introduce me to your
parents, I'm sure they would...

16:47.791 --> 16:51.571
Can we please just not talk
about this right now, Boyd?

16:51.688 --> 16:54.253
It's really not a good time.

16:56.332 --> 16:58.216
And when is it going to be
a good time?

17:00.302 --> 17:02.537
You really don't know when
to stop talking, do you?

17:04.373 --> 17:07.342
You know what?
I'm leaving.

17:09.211 --> 17:13.481
Morgan... Morgan, wait!

17:20.906 --> 17:22.240
Barkley!

17:22.942 --> 17:24.159
Barkley!

17:25.578 --> 17:26.778
Barkley!

17:32.751 --> 17:33.952
Barkley?

17:35.337 --> 17:36.704
Ah! Mmf!

17:48.184 --> 17:51.102
Oh! You scared me.

17:51.637 --> 17:53.254
Who'd you think I was?

18:00.779 --> 18:05.400
Oh. This is the timer for the pasta.
I gotta go turn it off.

18:08.120 --> 18:10.989
- I'll see you downstairs.
- Okay.

18:40.986 --> 18:43.571
- Ellen!
- I'll be right out!

18:43.990 --> 18:46.107
- Ellen!
- I said, just a minute!

19:11.717 --> 19:16.087
I'm not gonna repeat myself, so I
suggest you all listen very carefully.

19:25.364 --> 19:29.067
Oh my God, Dad, we've seen their faces,
that means they're gonna kill us!

19:32.238 --> 19:35.873
Follow my instructions,
and no one will get hurt.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.459
Don't try to be a hero.

19:38.461 --> 19:39.884
Don't test us.

19:39.963 --> 19:43.143
Cell phones, tablets, iPods,
in the bag. Let's go.

19:47.586 --> 19:49.337
What do you want from us?

19:49.339 --> 19:53.091
Didn't you get the memo, Bri?
Keep your mouth shut and do as you're told.

19:54.059 --> 19:56.177
Dr. Sanders. I need you to
come upstairs with me.

19:57.012 --> 19:58.212
Mom?

19:59.265 --> 20:00.484
Mom!

20:00.522 --> 20:02.488
You're not taking my wife
upstairs alone...

20:02.519 --> 20:04.269
- Didn't I just tell you to shut up?
- Dad!

20:04.271 --> 20:08.656
It's okay, it's okay! Please, it's okay!
Morgan, Jake, it's all right!

20:10.025 --> 20:13.894
I'll be fine.
Just...just do what they say.

20:45.611 --> 20:47.111
Do you love your family, Ellen?

20:47.113 --> 20:48.730
Oh, yes.

20:49.481 --> 20:51.316
Very much.

20:53.268 --> 20:55.119
Why are you doing this?

20:55.121 --> 20:57.605
Tomorrow you are going to
operate on the President.

20:59.325 --> 21:01.642
He will die during surgery.

21:01.644 --> 21:03.294
What?

21:04.663 --> 21:06.998
You are going to kill the President
of the United States, Ellen.

21:10.886 --> 21:13.388
Now do you understand
why we took off the masks?

21:14.890 --> 21:18.309
When this is finished,
we'll be in it together.

21:18.477 --> 21:20.895
No, this can't be happening.

21:22.398 --> 21:23.598
It's not possible.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.083
It is possible.

21:25.934 --> 21:27.769
We've worked out
all the details.

21:27.771 --> 21:29.487
Do this for us,

21:30.472 --> 21:33.791
and after tomorrow,
you'll never see us again.

21:33.975 --> 21:38.046
Otherwise,
we will kill your family.

21:57.109 --> 21:59.093
What did he want?
Who are they?

21:59.128 --> 22:01.228
Don't ask me.
I can't tell you.

22:01.413 --> 22:03.513
It's about the President,
isn't it?

22:05.701 --> 22:09.286
He is threatening to kill you
and the kids...

22:09.705 --> 22:12.923
Listen to me,
you can't be any part of this.

22:13.175 --> 22:15.894
We'll go to the Secret Service,
we'll get help,

22:15.929 --> 22:18.946
but I'm not going to
let them turn you into a...

22:20.182 --> 22:22.132
into a murderer.

22:49.628 --> 22:51.662
Is that all the windows?

22:51.664 --> 22:52.863
Yeah.

23:00.005 --> 23:01.205
What is it?

23:03.225 --> 23:04.425
Hey!

23:05.544 --> 23:07.545
Somebody tripped
a silent alarm.

23:48.432 --> 23:49.509
Hello?

23:49.589 --> 23:51.124
<i>Hi, this is Statehouse Security.</i>

23:51.159 --> 23:52.356
<i>Who am I speaking with?</i>

23:52.441 --> 23:53.726
Ellen Sanders.

23:53.761 --> 23:57.574
<i>Good evening, Mrs. Sanders, we received
a system alert from your address.</i>

23:57.609 --> 23:58.874
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

23:58.909 --> 24:03.234
Uh... Yes.
Must just be a faulty sensor.

24:03.302 --> 24:05.269
<i>Can I have your password,
please?</i>

24:08.740 --> 24:10.424
<i>Mrs. Sanders?</i>

24:10.876 --> 24:13.244
The password is "Ringo Starr."

24:21.503 --> 24:25.223
<i>Thank you. We have a patrol car in
your neighborhood, Mrs. Sanders.</i>

24:25.225 --> 24:26.624
<i>He'll stop by to check on you.</i>

24:26.626 --> 24:28.843
That really isn't necessary, really.

24:28.845 --> 24:31.479
<i>It's standard protocol, ma'am.
He's already on his way.</i>

24:42.774 --> 24:44.575
I'm disappointed.

24:46.912 --> 24:49.080
I thought we had an understanding.

24:50.616 --> 24:51.782
Please...

24:56.239 --> 24:59.422
- I'll get rid of them.
- If we want your help, we'll ask for it.

25:11.720 --> 25:14.154
There's been a mistake.
Everything's fine.

25:20.696 --> 25:22.396
You were in my...

25:26.351 --> 25:28.035
office.

25:33.742 --> 25:36.060
Sanders residence is clear.

25:40.999 --> 25:42.983
Open it.

25:50.058 --> 25:52.993
That photo was your
holiday card two years ago.

25:53.578 --> 25:57.598
You call your mother every Thursday,
the same day Jake has Tae Kwon Do,

25:57.717 --> 26:00.617
Brian hates chocolate and
Morgan's favorite color is red.

26:01.019 --> 26:02.686
Do I need to continue?

26:04.239 --> 26:10.094
We have eyes and ears everywhere,
we have thought of everything.

26:11.063 --> 26:13.530
Are you starting
to understand, Ellen?

26:15.200 --> 26:16.450
Are you?

26:18.420 --> 26:21.238
I won't give you another warning.

26:29.514 --> 26:33.467
Dinner is finished, Mr. Sanders.
You won't be needing that.

26:33.885 --> 26:34.852
Separate them.

26:34.854 --> 26:38.205
- Go up, move! Go!
- Hey!

26:38.390 --> 26:39.974
- Come on, get up. Move. Go!
- Ow!

26:39.976 --> 26:42.610
Hey! Hey! Take your hands
off my daughter!

26:46.431 --> 26:48.660
- Dad!
- No!

26:52.321 --> 26:53.537
Are you okay?

26:54.122 --> 26:55.156
Yeah, I'm all right.

26:55.158 --> 26:56.374
Get the kids out of here.

26:57.659 --> 26:59.210
Up! Get up! Move!

26:59.212 --> 27:00.411
Come on.

27:18.146 --> 27:20.914
What happened back there
was unfortunate.

27:21.683 --> 27:23.567
And unnecessary.

27:30.975 --> 27:34.812
As I told you before, we
didn't come here to hurt you.

27:35.364 --> 27:36.447
I know why you're here.

27:36.449 --> 27:39.517
Good. Then you
understand the stakes.

27:40.152 --> 27:41.218
You are going to cooperate.

27:41.703 --> 27:42.753
What are you gonna do?

27:42.755 --> 27:45.006
Are you gonna beat me more,
are you gonna shoot me?

27:47.709 --> 27:49.627
I prefer not to use force.

27:52.597 --> 27:54.632
Let's stop playing games, Brian.

27:56.702 --> 27:59.903
We both know you're not
the successful businessman.

28:00.072 --> 28:02.205
You're not the breadwinner.

28:02.557 --> 28:06.209
And you're not the loving
husband you pretend to be.

28:21.126 --> 28:23.026
We know all your secrets.

28:24.629 --> 28:26.113
All of them.

28:26.765 --> 28:30.431
That's why you're going
to tell your wife to cooperate.

28:42.589 --> 28:44.776
There's a website
where you can input

28:44.849 --> 28:47.632
your age, weight
and type of surgery you're having,

28:47.667 --> 28:49.180
and it will calculate the risks.

28:49.215 --> 28:51.713
And there's a website where you
can watch cockroaches dance,

28:51.715 --> 28:54.149
but that doesn't mean it's
a good use of your time.

28:55.051 --> 28:56.819
You don't have to go
through with it, Paul.

28:56.821 --> 28:59.271
You can still get the Chief Surgeon
at Johns Hopkins.

28:59.273 --> 29:01.356
I'm going to be fine.

29:01.509 --> 29:04.993
It's a routine surgery and she's
the top surgeon at the hospital.

29:05.612 --> 29:07.729
I'm worried Quentin is going to
pull an Al Haig while you're under

29:07.731 --> 29:09.648
and declare martial law.

29:09.850 --> 29:12.801
That thought alone will give me
the strength to pull through.

29:17.773 --> 29:21.776
Roughly five mutes after the liquid is
absorbed into the President's blood,

29:22.128 --> 29:24.078
you can expect
to see a reaction.

29:24.413 --> 29:26.048
What kind of reaction?

29:26.050 --> 29:28.333
His system will start to crash.

29:29.085 --> 29:32.037
Just follow regular procedures.
Nothing you do will save him.

29:32.172 --> 29:34.339
Well, what's in the vial?

29:34.674 --> 29:36.558
Don't worry.
It won't show up in the autopsy.

29:36.660 --> 29:38.978
You expect me to trust you?

29:39.013 --> 29:41.696
Do you think I want to
leave any traces behind?

29:42.031 --> 29:45.684
You're a smart woman, Ellen.
You can do this.

29:54.310 --> 29:56.962
They'll never stop looking for you.

29:57.547 --> 30:00.565
You'll never get away with this,
you know that.

30:02.952 --> 30:05.303
Why are you doing this?

30:05.472 --> 30:07.705
That's none of your concern.

30:09.092 --> 30:13.227
All you have to focus on
is why you're doing this.

30:14.147 --> 30:17.065
Don't think of it
as killing the President.

30:18.318 --> 30:21.753
Think of it
as saving your family.

30:27.710 --> 30:30.078
You should do your homework
or something.

30:31.281 --> 30:32.781
I don't have any.

30:36.169 --> 30:37.452
Where is it?

30:37.454 --> 30:38.970
What?

30:39.005 --> 30:41.567
The phone you're hiding,
where is it?

30:42.058 --> 30:43.842
Listen, I can explain.

30:44.644 --> 30:48.012
Here.
Take whatever you want.

30:56.873 --> 30:58.840
Who's Nico?

30:59.275 --> 31:01.509
A guy I owe money to.

31:01.694 --> 31:03.445
The pot belongs to him.

31:04.781 --> 31:05.948
Uh-huh.

31:08.201 --> 31:12.854
Family emergency.
Can't make it.

31:13.456 --> 31:15.590
Call you tomorrow.

31:15.625 --> 31:17.575
No. No, you can't...

31:17.627 --> 31:19.694
Oh, man.

31:21.714 --> 31:23.131
Man...

31:31.808 --> 31:35.476
You know, our friends are gonna start
wondering why they can't reach us.

31:36.229 --> 31:37.846
He's not gonna call.

31:39.999 --> 31:41.600
Who?

31:43.052 --> 31:44.953
Pick Up Truck.

31:50.076 --> 31:52.494
You were watching us?

31:59.202 --> 32:00.919
What? What is it?

32:04.607 --> 32:07.108
Why did you kill my dog?

32:15.134 --> 32:16.851
Barkley!

32:19.055 --> 32:21.673
The drugs will wear off
by tomorrow.

32:28.681 --> 32:32.400
You've got a big surgery tomorrow, Ellen.
Time to get ready for bed.

33:18.414 --> 33:21.166
Ellen! Let's go.

33:31.477 --> 33:34.012
The son's dealing weed.

33:34.314 --> 33:36.781
We're not here to
sort out their problems.

33:38.151 --> 33:40.301
Why'd you show him the dog?

33:41.354 --> 33:43.588
He's just a kid.
I felt sorry for him.

33:43.623 --> 33:47.942
They have to fear us.
It's the only way to control them.

33:48.678 --> 33:50.317
Remember why we're here.

33:50.322 --> 33:53.841
Sometimes you have to do a bad thing
for a good reason.

33:55.068 --> 33:57.752
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

34:04.243 --> 34:06.578
Good night, honey.
I love you.

34:19.809 --> 34:20.875
Duncan.

34:20.877 --> 34:22.226
<i>How is she doing?</i>

34:23.346 --> 34:25.514
Fine. She fell asleep reading.

34:26.099 --> 34:29.050
Good. Thank you.

34:29.518 --> 34:32.152
- How are you?
- All good.

34:32.422 --> 34:33.922
What about our friend?

34:35.257 --> 34:39.351
- He's here.
- Put him on.

34:46.536 --> 34:49.360
Hello, Duncan. I just came
from the White House.

34:49.476 --> 34:52.056
Everything is in motion.
Can we count on you?

34:52.159 --> 34:55.259
Don't worry, Quentin.
She'll come through.

35:24.024 --> 35:26.076
What about school?
They'll call.

35:26.195 --> 35:29.029
It's been taken care of.
It's your turn to get dressed.

35:31.833 --> 35:35.001
I need to go to the bathroom.
Like, right away.

35:35.104 --> 35:38.739
I'll take her. Make sure Dr. Sanders
gets something to eat.

35:39.207 --> 35:40.473
I'm not hungry.

35:43.511 --> 35:44.778
You all right?

35:45.313 --> 35:46.613
Fine.

36:02.930 --> 36:05.565
Morgan? You okay?

36:13.207 --> 36:14.741
- Hey!
- Morgan!

36:16.611 --> 36:17.978
Please don't tell...

36:18.679 --> 36:20.380
It's none of my business.

36:21.082 --> 36:22.282
Morgan!

36:26.320 --> 36:27.487
Morgan!

36:29.557 --> 36:31.425
Morgan, are you okay?

36:32.193 --> 36:33.360
I'm fine, Mom.

36:33.362 --> 36:35.061
What are you doing in here
alone with my daughter?

36:35.063 --> 36:37.764
He was trying to help.
I think I have a stomach virus.

36:40.334 --> 36:42.235
She's dehydrated.
She needs liquids.

36:42.237 --> 36:44.771
We'll handle it.
You need to get ready to go.

36:46.574 --> 36:47.741
Mom.

36:48.242 --> 36:49.943
Just do what they say.

37:16.320 --> 37:18.405
Can I have a moment
alone with my wife?

37:19.290 --> 37:20.774
Go ahead.

37:26.981 --> 37:29.199
You have to cooperate.
We have no choice.

37:29.201 --> 37:30.283
What?

37:30.285 --> 37:32.485
What about going to
the Secret Service?

37:32.494 --> 37:35.154
It's too risky.
We can't take that chance.

37:35.156 --> 37:37.841
- Yesterday you said...
- I know what I said yesterday.

37:39.827 --> 37:41.178
I was wrong.

37:42.430 --> 37:45.382
We're talking about
a man's life, Brian.

37:45.633 --> 37:48.267
Look, Ellen,
just do what they say,

37:48.336 --> 37:50.169
and then everything can
go back the way it was.

37:50.171 --> 37:53.373
Like...
Like it never happened.

37:55.509 --> 37:58.211
Except I'm the one
who has to live with it.

38:12.877 --> 38:14.560
I'll be home soon.

38:15.079 --> 38:16.296
Love you, Jake.

38:18.082 --> 38:22.153
You hang in there.
We'll get through this together.

38:24.255 --> 38:25.422
Ellen.

38:26.974 --> 38:28.425
It's time to go.

39:44.085 --> 39:45.618
You okay?

39:46.620 --> 39:48.254
I'll be fine.

39:53.594 --> 39:55.533
There she is!

40:12.780 --> 40:14.364
Doctor has arrived.

40:37.888 --> 40:39.356
Well, Dr. Sanders...

40:40.107 --> 40:42.025
Mr. President.
How are you feeling?

40:43.477 --> 40:47.397
I make decisions affecting millions
of lives, all day long, every day.

40:47.533 --> 40:50.784
The idea of surrendering complete control
to someone else for the next few hours

40:50.786 --> 40:52.235
is kind of a relief.

40:54.188 --> 40:58.158
So, I know we've gone over it before but
I just want to show you one last time.

40:58.243 --> 41:00.093
See that shadow right there?

41:00.428 --> 41:02.295
That's what doesn't
belong in there.

41:02.397 --> 41:06.032
The operation itself is
relatively simple, but

41:06.884 --> 41:08.918
we do want to make
sure we get it all out.

41:09.103 --> 41:12.005
Well,
I have full confidence in you.

41:14.341 --> 41:15.975
Thank you, sir.

41:17.428 --> 41:20.379
The nurse will be in soon
to start your IV, Mr. President.

41:31.492 --> 41:32.859
I hear something's wrong.

41:32.861 --> 41:34.727
Did something happen
to the President?

41:35.830 --> 41:38.064
Step back.
I need you to step back.

41:45.589 --> 41:47.006
What's going on?

41:49.844 --> 41:52.262
<i>We interrupt your
regularly scheduled programming</i>

41:52.264 --> 41:54.714
<i>to bring you this special
edition of Channel 10 news.</i>

41:54.716 --> 41:57.583
<i>We are following the latest right
now out of Bethesda, Maryland,</i>

41:57.585 --> 42:00.419
<i>where the President was scheduled
to have surgery today.</i>

42:00.421 --> 42:02.439
<i>We'll take you there
for a live report.</i>

42:02.441 --> 42:04.257
<i>I'm here at
Maryland College Hospital,</i>

42:04.259 --> 42:07.393
<i>where we are just getting an update
on the status of the President.</i>

42:07.413 --> 42:11.147
<i>We've just been told that the President
will not be undergoing surgery today.</i>

42:11.283 --> 42:15.869
<i>He was mistakenly given a blood thinner
only hours before his scheduled surgery.</i>

42:15.871 --> 42:18.238
<i>We have been told
the White House will</i>

42:18.240 --> 42:21.291
<i>be launching an
investigation into the matter.</i>

42:21.309 --> 42:23.549
