12:27.247 --> 12:30.150
sometimes two humans think
they're right for each other,

12:30.184 --> 12:32.652
and no matter how much
in love they are,

12:32.686 --> 12:35.489
for whatever reason,
it just doesn't work out.

12:35.522 --> 12:38.292
Sometimes one of them loses
perspective on the relationship,

12:38.325 --> 12:41.295
and sometimes the other one
has sex with a blue alien.

12:41.328 --> 12:43.397
Humans are very
flawed animals that way.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.532
Captain... look.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.837
(beeps)

12:50.870 --> 12:52.472
There are
three life-forms

12:52.506 --> 12:54.008
inside the structure.

12:54.041 --> 12:55.475
All right,
time to meet the locals.

13:04.851 --> 13:06.453
(knocking)

13:09.523 --> 13:12.192
Hi, I'm Captain Ed Mercer
of the...

13:12.226 --> 13:13.827
Jehovah's Witnesses.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.829
Well, that's not quite
the greeting we wanted.

13:15.862 --> 13:16.930
ISAAC:
Perhaps she fears

13:16.963 --> 13:18.832
you are not sexually adequate.

13:18.865 --> 13:19.966
Look, it's fine, all right?

13:20.000 --> 13:20.834
I'm just gonna try again.

13:26.206 --> 13:27.641
Hi, I'm Captain Ed Mercer-- holy crap!
(gun cocks)

13:30.510 --> 13:32.846
(panting)

13:32.879 --> 13:33.847
Thanks, Isaac.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.182
You are welcome.

13:41.721 --> 13:44.658
Ma'am, we're very sorry.

13:44.691 --> 13:46.226
Your husband's gonna be okay,
he's only stunned.

13:46.260 --> 13:47.827
You didn't kill him, right?

13:47.861 --> 13:48.895
Of course not.

13:48.928 --> 13:50.464
He's only stunned.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.399
We'd like to talk to you
for a minute if we can.

13:52.432 --> 13:53.400
Who are you?

13:53.433 --> 13:54.701
What is that?

13:54.734 --> 13:56.670
I'm Captain Ed Mercer.

13:56.703 --> 13:58.038
This is Dr. Claire Finn,

13:58.072 --> 13:59.639
and that's Isaac.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.075
Our ship encountered
your vessel

14:01.108 --> 14:03.177
adrift in space.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.045
We know your engines
are inoperative,

14:05.079 --> 14:06.580
and you're heading
right toward a star.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.482
We'd like to help you
try and make repairs,

14:08.515 --> 14:10.984
and if that doesn't work,
offer evacuation ships.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.552
I don't understand.

14:12.586 --> 14:14.254
Well, honestly,
there's a lot

14:14.288 --> 14:15.755
that we don't
understand either.

14:15.789 --> 14:17.757
We've never seen anything
like this place.

14:17.791 --> 14:19.426
What is it?

14:19.459 --> 14:22.429
This is our farm,
my husband and I.

14:22.462 --> 14:25.765
I gathered that,
but this ship...

14:25.799 --> 14:27.234
where did it come from?

14:27.267 --> 14:29.503
I don't understand
what you're asking.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.105
Are you from the Underland?

14:31.138 --> 14:33.840
Please, don't harm us.
We're good,

14:33.873 --> 14:36.276
decent people.
We embrace the word of Dorahl.

14:36.310 --> 14:37.344
Who's Dorahl?

14:37.377 --> 14:38.512
(door opens)

14:38.545 --> 14:39.746
Mom?

14:39.779 --> 14:40.847
WOMAN: Get back
in your room,

14:40.880 --> 14:41.748
Tomilin, now.

14:41.781 --> 14:43.217
Who are they?

14:43.250 --> 14:44.284
I said now!

14:44.318 --> 14:45.552
Tomilin, is it?

14:45.585 --> 14:48.021
We don't mean
your family any harm.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.589
Well, we did just
shoot his dad.

14:49.623 --> 14:51.958
Aside from shooting your dad, we
don't mean your family any harm.

14:51.991 --> 14:53.127
He's only stunned.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.761
Are you real?

14:54.794 --> 14:56.096
ISAAC:
Captain,

14:56.130 --> 14:57.231
if I may...

14:57.264 --> 14:59.866
Tomilin, my name is Isaac.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.635
I am an artificial
life-form.

15:01.668 --> 15:04.037
Can you tell me what
sort of vessel this is?

15:04.070 --> 15:05.705
From where do you originate?

15:05.739 --> 15:08.608
An artific... What?

15:08.642 --> 15:10.444
Please, answer my question.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.045
What is this place?

15:12.078 --> 15:13.447
The hills, the trees,

15:13.480 --> 15:15.482
the cities,
all that we can see...

15:15.515 --> 15:16.783
what is it?

15:16.816 --> 15:18.985
What do mean? It's...

15:19.018 --> 15:21.155
it's what it is.
It's everything.

15:21.188 --> 15:22.922
Captain...

15:22.956 --> 15:24.458
I do not believe
these people know

15:24.491 --> 15:26.160
they are on board a spacecraft.

15:45.044 --> 15:47.781
Are you from Beyond?

15:47.814 --> 15:50.116
You shut your mouth
with that blasphemy, Tomilin.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.986
What if, what if
we are, Tomilin?

15:53.019 --> 15:55.255
What if we're from Beyond?

15:55.289 --> 15:57.023
Come with me. WOMAN: Tomilin.

15:58.192 --> 15:59.626
Tomilin!

15:59.659 --> 16:02.562
Get back here! Tomilin!

16:03.697 --> 16:05.632
♪

16:09.336 --> 16:12.439
ALARA:
God, this is so beautiful.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.608
I can't believe
a place like this exists.

16:14.641 --> 16:18.011
Oh, it'd be a perfect place for
a romantic afternoon picnic.

16:18.044 --> 16:19.846
(chuckles)
It would.

16:19.879 --> 16:21.681
Speaking of,

16:21.715 --> 16:23.383
how's it going with you
and Josh?

16:23.417 --> 16:26.953
Yeah, that's, uh, that's over.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.722
What? I thought you
were really into him.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.457
I was.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.492
But it turns out
he has a massive hang-up

16:32.526 --> 16:34.060
about the fact
that his girlfriend

16:34.093 --> 16:36.363
can beat the crap out of him
with one finger, so...

16:36.396 --> 16:38.064
Ah, I see.

16:38.097 --> 16:42.536
You just, you have no idea
what a-a social roadblock it is

16:42.569 --> 16:44.738
being the strongest person
on the ship, you know.

16:44.771 --> 16:47.341
I mean, aside from Isaac,
but even that's a toss-up.

16:47.374 --> 16:48.742
A lot of guys are
weird about it, yeah?

16:48.775 --> 16:50.244
Oh, my God,
it's ridiculous.

16:50.277 --> 16:51.745
But then there's
the captain,

16:51.778 --> 16:54.180
and he doesn't even
seem to care, you know?

16:54.214 --> 16:57.050
I mean, whenever
I open a hatchway

16:57.083 --> 16:58.718
or lift something heavy,

16:58.752 --> 17:00.387
he just gives me
this gratified look

17:00.420 --> 17:02.589
like I just cleaned up
his dog's puke.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.891
Yeah, well, trust me, Ed has
his own set of hang-ups.

17:04.924 --> 17:06.593
Like what?

17:06.626 --> 17:08.995
I mean, that,
that's none of my business.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.497
But you want to know.

17:10.530 --> 17:11.765
Kind of, yeah.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.667
I mean, honestly,
everyone is wondering about

17:13.700 --> 17:14.668
the whole story.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.436
With the divorce.
Yeah.

17:16.470 --> 17:18.037
I mean, aside from the obvious.
The obvious thing.

17:18.071 --> 17:19.506
Yeah, that. (laughs)

17:19.539 --> 17:21.341
And please tell me
if I'm out of line.

17:21.375 --> 17:22.876
No, listen, you're fine.

17:22.909 --> 17:26.246
Look, I mean, Ed just...

17:26.280 --> 17:27.947
he had trouble with balance,

17:27.981 --> 17:30.584
you know, between
work and home and...

17:30.617 --> 17:31.851
I don't know. I just
started to feel

17:31.885 --> 17:34.621
like I was living alone.

17:34.654 --> 17:37.691
And although I regret
sleeping with Darulio...

17:37.724 --> 17:39.459
I don't know,
in a weird way, it just...

17:39.493 --> 17:40.960
it was inevitable.

17:40.994 --> 17:42.962
As awful as that sounds.

17:42.996 --> 17:45.365
That's really tough. I'm sorry.

17:45.399 --> 17:47.033
Wait.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.201
(vehicle approaching)
Do you hear that?

17:48.234 --> 17:49.803
Yeah.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.571
Commander, look.

18:03.016 --> 18:04.551
May I see your identification?

18:04.584 --> 18:06.720
Good afternoon to you, too.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.455
Your identification.

18:08.488 --> 18:10.424
I'm Commander Kelly Grayson
of the USS Orville,

18:10.457 --> 18:11.658
and this is my security chief,

18:11.691 --> 18:13.259
Alara Kitan.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.795
We encountered your vessel...
Your identification now.

18:17.163 --> 18:19.899
Mine's actually
in my other pants.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.401
I'd rather not show you mine

18:21.435 --> 18:23.269
'cause I look really bad in my picture.
She does.

18:23.303 --> 18:24.438
She looks
really shiny and gross.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.239
Have you ever heard
of combination skin?

18:26.272 --> 18:27.674
What?
(mouthing)

18:27.707 --> 18:29.175
Step into the vehicle.

18:29.208 --> 18:31.578
Okay, if you could just
put your weapons down

18:31.611 --> 18:32.646
and let us explain...

18:32.679 --> 18:34.681
Alara!

18:52.332 --> 18:54.834
You want to tell us
where we're going?

18:54.868 --> 18:56.803
I had to get you
away from there.

18:56.836 --> 18:59.439
Yeah, I wouldn't want to be
around when your dad wakes up.

18:59.473 --> 19:01.040
There are those among us

19:01.074 --> 19:03.309
who have begun
to question scripture.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.111
We believe that there may
be more to the universe

19:05.144 --> 19:06.446
than what we can see.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.548
Your mother spoke
of a Dorahl.

19:08.582 --> 19:10.116
Who is that?

19:10.149 --> 19:11.651
Dorahl is the creator.

19:11.685 --> 19:13.653
The creator of the universe?

19:13.687 --> 19:15.221
That's what
we're taught, yes.

19:15.254 --> 19:17.524
The common impulse
of biological life-forms

19:17.557 --> 19:19.058
to attribute
the origin of the universe

19:19.092 --> 19:20.994
to an omnipotent being

19:21.027 --> 19:22.629
is most curious.

19:22.662 --> 19:23.997
Well, then, how do you
think the universe began?

19:24.030 --> 19:26.032
On the subnuclear scale,

19:26.065 --> 19:28.201
it is quite natural
for quantum fluctuations

19:28.234 --> 19:31.371
to create matter and energy
where none exist.

19:31.405 --> 19:34.908
Where you come from,
is it like this?

19:34.941 --> 19:38.545
Our ship is similar to yours
in some ways.

19:38.578 --> 19:42.015
Um, the pollen count's
a little lower.

19:42.048 --> 19:43.750
You're not gonna get
Lyme disease

19:43.783 --> 19:45.318
walking through our ship,
but other than that,

19:45.351 --> 19:47.521
it's more or less the same.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.889
If you really are from Beyond,

19:49.923 --> 19:52.526
then the doubts of the Reformers
become impossible to ignore.

19:52.559 --> 19:53.893
The Reformers?

19:53.927 --> 19:55.328
Who are they?

19:55.361 --> 19:57.363
I'll show you.

20:02.068 --> 20:04.103
My friends, our world

20:04.137 --> 20:06.239
is about to change.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.380
I don't know
how they do it.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.715
I really don't.

20:15.749 --> 20:16.916
You just do it,
I guess.

20:16.950 --> 20:18.452
I don't know.

20:18.485 --> 20:20.219
I mean, if I had to work
alongside my ex-wife,

20:20.253 --> 20:22.021
day in and day out,

20:22.055 --> 20:24.223
man, I'd rather chew
broken glass.

20:24.257 --> 20:26.125
Wait, you were married?

20:26.159 --> 20:28.061
Hell, no.

20:28.094 --> 20:30.697
In fact, when I imagine the
person I'd fall in love with,

20:30.730 --> 20:33.066
the person who could bring me
so much happiness

20:33.099 --> 20:35.802
that I'd want us to spend
the rest of our lives together,

20:35.835 --> 20:38.204
God, it just makes me want
to kill myself.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.874
Huh. That seems reasonable.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.709
Commander, we're receiving
a priority one distress call

20:42.742 --> 20:44.210
from the USS Druyan.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.579
Put it through.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.213
DRUYAN CAPTAIN:
Repeat: To any Union vessel

20:47.246 --> 20:50.717
within range,
we're under attack by the Krill.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.218
We've taken heavy casual...
(beeping)

20:52.251 --> 20:53.620
Lieutenant?
It's okay.

20:53.653 --> 20:54.754
I got a lock on it.

20:54.788 --> 20:56.322
Coordinates 3-1-9-alpha,

20:56.355 --> 20:57.591
mark 7.2.

20:57.624 --> 21:00.393
Sir, the Druyan
is a colony transport.

21:00.426 --> 21:01.961
They probably
have children on board.

21:01.995 --> 21:03.429
How quickly can we get there?

21:03.463 --> 21:04.731
If we push the hell out
of the engines,

21:04.764 --> 21:06.132
we can maybe be there
in 20 minutes.

21:06.165 --> 21:07.634
Set course. Maximum velocity.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.102
What about
the boarding party?

21:09.135 --> 21:10.670
We will have to hope
they do not need us

21:10.704 --> 21:12.105
until we return.

21:12.138 --> 21:13.306
Launch a communication buoy

21:13.339 --> 21:14.273
so they know what's happened.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.854
(beeping rhythmically)

21:37.396 --> 21:38.331
We've long suspected
that there is more

21:38.364 --> 21:40.767
to the universe
than we can see.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.770
But until now,
we had no proof.

21:43.803 --> 21:46.773
Your arrival means more
than you can possibly know.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.508
That's why we have
to take them to the City,

21:48.542 --> 21:50.143
show everyone.

21:50.176 --> 21:52.612
They'll have to accept it then.
Really, Tomilin?

21:52.646 --> 21:54.380
How well did your mother
and father accept it?

21:55.982 --> 21:57.817
The concept of a Beyond

21:57.851 --> 22:00.854
has been heresy throughout
all of recorded history.

22:00.887 --> 22:03.322
People don't alter
their beliefs easily.

22:03.356 --> 22:05.725
Well, they're gonna have to
if they want to stay alive.

22:05.759 --> 22:08.494
If this ship drifts
into that star,

22:08.528 --> 22:10.864
your whole world is gonna fry.

22:10.897 --> 22:12.298
Why would anyone ignore this

22:12.331 --> 22:13.800
when there's a chance
to stop it?

22:13.833 --> 22:16.369
Many people refuse to
accept an irrefutable truth

22:16.402 --> 22:19.505
simply because that truth
puts them in the wrong.

22:19.539 --> 22:21.541
You can rest assured
Hamelac is such a man.

22:21.575 --> 22:23.009
Who's Hamelac?

22:23.042 --> 22:24.544
First Guardian of
the Word of Dorahl.

22:24.578 --> 22:26.913
He makes all law.

22:26.946 --> 22:29.315
If he knew we were here
speaking of this,

22:29.348 --> 22:30.483
he would put us
all to death.

22:30.516 --> 22:31.985
Sounds like a dick.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.086
A what?

22:33.119 --> 22:34.253
It is a compliment.

22:35.789 --> 22:37.891
You must be hungry
after your journey.

22:37.924 --> 22:39.659
Leiken, bring some food.

22:39.693 --> 22:43.096
So your teachings tell you
that this Dorahl

22:43.129 --> 22:45.231
is the creator
of your universe?

22:45.264 --> 22:47.333
They do. ISAAC: Captain,

22:47.366 --> 22:50.069
it seems we have encountered
a dictatorial theocracy.

22:50.103 --> 22:51.738
Oh, great, those are
always fun.

22:51.771 --> 22:53.272
When you've eaten,

22:53.306 --> 22:54.608
there is something
we must show you.

22:54.641 --> 22:56.576
In the meantime,
anything else you can tell us

22:56.610 --> 22:58.444
about your society
would be helpful.

22:58.477 --> 23:02.015
Um, this Dorahl, for example.

23:02.048 --> 23:04.784
How do the stories say...

23:04.818 --> 23:07.086
Is something wrong?

23:07.120 --> 23:08.788
KEMKA: Is the food not
to your liking?

23:08.822 --> 23:11.257
(muffled)
No, it's... it's good.

23:11.290 --> 23:12.592
It's actually very good.

23:12.626 --> 23:14.093
Um...

23:14.127 --> 23:16.329
do you have a napkin?

23:27.273 --> 23:29.275
(clears throat)
That's excellent.

23:29.308 --> 23:30.409
Thank you.

23:32.278 --> 23:34.648
Where's your garbage?

23:34.681 --> 23:36.215
(comm beeps)

23:36.249 --> 23:37.416
Mercer here, go ahead.

23:37.450 --> 23:38.551
ALARA:
Captain...

23:38.584 --> 23:40.419
Alara, you okay?

23:40.453 --> 23:41.955
No.

23:41.988 --> 23:43.623
I-I've been shot.

23:43.657 --> 23:45.324
Where are you?
Is Kelly with you?

23:45.358 --> 23:46.626
ALARA:
No.

23:46.660 --> 23:49.395
Transmitting homing signal now.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.764
All right, we're
on our way. Mercer out.

23:50.797 --> 23:52.465
Come on.
I'll go with you.

23:52.498 --> 23:54.000
I know the territory.

23:55.534 --> 23:57.203
(people clamoring)

23:58.972 --> 24:00.473
(clamoring continues)

24:00.506 --> 24:02.508
And I ask you this.

24:02.541 --> 24:05.144
Do you embrace
the word of Dorahl?

24:05.178 --> 24:07.113
ALL:
Yes!

24:07.146 --> 24:09.248
Are we united as a people

24:09.282 --> 24:11.785
by Dorahl's truth and love?

24:11.818 --> 24:13.419
ALL:
Yes!

24:13.452 --> 24:15.021
What of those who question...

24:15.054 --> 24:16.522
(crowd grumbling)

24:16.555 --> 24:19.292
...who deny Dorahl's gift
to the universe?

24:19.325 --> 24:21.460
Can they be allowed to live amongst us?
ALL: No!

24:21.494 --> 24:25.031
To grow and fester
and to challenge

24:25.064 --> 24:26.532
the benevolence of Dorahl?

24:26.565 --> 24:28.134
ALL:
No!

24:28.167 --> 24:29.535
Bring him out.

24:29.568 --> 24:31.204
(shouting)

24:35.308 --> 24:38.344
This man is one of those

24:38.377 --> 24:40.346
who call themselves

24:40.379 --> 24:41.681
Reformers.

24:41.715 --> 24:43.116
(crowd booing)

24:43.149 --> 24:45.719
He is charged
with heresy.

24:45.752 --> 24:48.521
He has distributed
hateful material

24:48.554 --> 24:49.956
right here within the City.

24:49.989 --> 24:52.458
He openly defies

24:52.491 --> 24:54.828
the benevolence of Dorahl!

24:54.861 --> 24:56.329
(clamoring)

24:57.697 --> 25:00.499
He is yours to sentence!

25:00.533 --> 25:01.735
(clamoring)

25:01.768 --> 25:03.636
Take him!

25:03.669 --> 25:05.238
(clamoring)

25:19.719 --> 25:20.920
(clamoring continues)

25:22.221 --> 25:23.890
(clamoring, blows landing)

25:34.433 --> 25:36.970
She was carrying this.

25:39.773 --> 25:41.374
Sit down.

25:41.407 --> 25:42.608
I'll stand if you don't mind.

25:45.478 --> 25:47.747
Who the hell are you, and
why have you brought me here?

25:47.781 --> 25:49.715
Interesting.

25:49.749 --> 25:51.818
A weapon, is it?

25:53.619 --> 25:56.122
Perhaps you can tell me
how it works.

25:56.155 --> 25:58.958
And what
that clothing is

25:58.992 --> 26:00.760
you're wearing.

26:02.829 --> 26:04.597
Why did you kill that man
out there?

26:04.630 --> 26:06.632
I didn't kill anyone.

26:06.665 --> 26:08.802
Do you see blood on my hands?

26:08.835 --> 26:10.736
You incited that mob
to beat him to death.

26:10.770 --> 26:11.637
You killed him.

26:11.670 --> 26:13.139
Why?

26:13.172 --> 26:16.109
The people do as they wish.

26:16.142 --> 26:20.079
And today, they wished
to carry out the word of Dorahl.

26:20.113 --> 26:22.081
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about,

26:22.115 --> 26:25.284
but your goons shot my friend.

26:25.318 --> 26:26.419
I don't know if she's
alive or dead.

26:26.452 --> 26:28.554
So let me go
right now,

26:28.587 --> 26:30.824
or I swear to God
there will be trouble.

26:30.857 --> 26:32.425
Trouble?

26:32.458 --> 26:33.659
Yeah.

26:33.692 --> 26:35.594
From whom?

26:35.628 --> 26:38.898
Other friends?

26:38.932 --> 26:42.268
I said sit down.

26:42.301 --> 26:45.704
You're going to be our guest
for a while.

26:58.818 --> 27:00.486
(trilling)

27:00.519 --> 27:01.821
There.

27:01.855 --> 27:03.522
Oh, my God.

27:03.556 --> 27:05.158
Alara. Can you hear me?

27:07.160 --> 27:09.162
She's lost a tremendous amount
of blood,

27:09.195 --> 27:10.529
but she's alive.

27:10.563 --> 27:12.265
There are three metal slugs

27:12.298 --> 27:14.000
lodged in her upper chest.

27:14.033 --> 27:15.168
I'm gonna remove them.

27:23.376 --> 27:25.278
What sort of magic is that?

27:25.311 --> 27:26.980
It's medical science, baby.

27:27.013 --> 27:28.381
And with this,

27:28.414 --> 27:31.017
I can accelerate
plasma regeneration,

27:31.050 --> 27:32.852
have her back on her feet
in no time.

27:32.886 --> 27:34.387
(whirring)

27:40.927 --> 27:42.528
(laughs softly)

27:42.561 --> 27:44.497
You found me.

27:44.530 --> 27:46.699
Thank God for that tough

27:46.732 --> 27:48.367
Xelayan body of yours.

27:48.401 --> 27:50.803
If she were human,
she'd be dead by now.

27:50.836 --> 27:51.804
Alara.
Hmm?

27:51.837 --> 27:53.072
Where's Kelly?

27:53.106 --> 27:55.508
Uh, t-there were
two uniformed men,

27:55.541 --> 27:57.043
they must have taken her.

27:57.076 --> 27:58.744
Enforcers.

27:58.777 --> 28:01.314
They probably took her
to the City, to Hamelac.

28:01.347 --> 28:02.548
Can you stand up?

28:02.581 --> 28:05.718
I think so. (grunts)

28:05.751 --> 28:08.754
I imagine this Hamelac
is pretty well-guarded, yeah?

28:08.787 --> 28:11.024
There'll be many more Enforcers,
yes.

28:11.057 --> 28:12.658
We're gonna have to assemble
a rescue team.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.593
Isaac, go back to the shuttle,

28:14.627 --> 28:16.896
contact the Orville,
tell them we need backup, fast.

28:16.930 --> 28:18.397
Yes, Captain.

28:29.142 --> 28:31.077
(buoy beeping rhythmically)

28:34.647 --> 28:35.781
Isaac to Captain.

28:35.814 --> 28:36.882
ED:
Go ahead.

28:36.916 --> 28:38.251
The Orville is gone.

28:38.284 --> 28:39.852
What? What do you mean,
it's gone?

28:39.885 --> 28:42.421
According to the communication
buoy they left behind,

28:42.455 --> 28:44.390
there was a distress call.

28:44.423 --> 28:46.960
They say they will return
as soon as possible.

28:46.993 --> 28:48.561
What kind of distress call?

29:03.676 --> 29:05.878
Sir, quantum drive injectors
have been compromised.

29:05.911 --> 29:07.313
We can't take another hit
on the starboard side.

29:07.346 --> 29:08.281
Commander, we've
knocked the hell

29:08.314 --> 29:09.748
out of their engines, too.

29:09.782 --> 29:11.650
If we concentrate fire there,

29:11.684 --> 29:12.751
maybe we can get them
before they get us.

29:12.785 --> 29:14.387
(explosion)

29:14.420 --> 29:15.888
We must disable
their weapons first.

29:15.921 --> 29:17.323
I don't think
we'll have time.

29:17.356 --> 29:18.557
Sir, trust me on this.

29:18.591 --> 29:20.326
Very well.

29:20.359 --> 29:23.329
Transfer weapons control
to Lieutenant Lamarr's station.

29:43.049 --> 29:45.118
Oh! Boom, bitch. That's
what I'm talking about.

29:45.151 --> 29:46.986
Right there. I'm like, "Boom."
(mimics explosion) Lieutenant.

29:47.653 --> 29:50.256
Sorry.

29:50.289 --> 29:51.757
Well done, Lieutenant.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.092
(whispers):
Boom.

29:53.126 --> 29:54.527
What is the status
of the Druyan?

29:54.560 --> 29:56.662
They report some injuries,
but no fatalities.

29:56.695 --> 29:58.497
STEVE:
Engineering to bridge.

29:58.531 --> 30:00.333
We took a lot of damage
to the starboard injector.

30:00.366 --> 30:02.468
It'll be an hour
before we can get underway.

30:02.501 --> 30:04.937
We must hope the captain
and his team are not in danger.

30:04.970 --> 30:06.039
(grunts)

30:06.072 --> 30:07.506
One more time.

30:07.540 --> 30:08.674
Who are you,

30:08.707 --> 30:10.376
and where are the others?

30:10.409 --> 30:12.545
I already told you,
you stupid son of a bitch.

30:12.578 --> 30:15.281
Our vessel encountered
yours drifting in space,

30:15.314 --> 30:16.315
and we're trying to help you

30:16.349 --> 30:17.883
before you fall into that star

30:17.916 --> 30:19.652
and get your nuts burned off.
And I told you

30:19.685 --> 30:23.022
you're lying
because there is no such place.

30:23.056 --> 30:24.223
Again.

30:25.991 --> 30:29.062
Where are your friends?

30:29.095 --> 30:31.230
Well, last time I saw them, one
of them was banging your mom,

30:31.264 --> 30:32.531
and the other one
was high-fiving him.

30:36.035 --> 30:37.203
Where...

30:37.236 --> 30:38.904
are...

30:38.937 --> 30:42.841
your... friends?

30:42.875 --> 30:45.044
(whispers):
Okay.

30:45.078 --> 30:47.880
I'll tell you.

30:47.913 --> 30:50.483
There's a little coffee shop

30:50.516 --> 30:52.851
on Lafayette Street in SoHo

30:52.885 --> 30:55.554
called Central Perk.

30:55.588 --> 30:57.856
My friends are there.

30:57.890 --> 31:00.926
Just please...

31:00.959 --> 31:03.362
don't hurt the monkey.

31:06.532 --> 31:07.300
(grunts)

31:09.968 --> 31:11.937
That's the
Capitol building.

31:11.970 --> 31:14.006
It's where
they interrogate dissidents.

31:14.039 --> 31:16.209
If Hamelac has your friend,

31:16.242 --> 31:17.710
that's where she'll be.

31:17.743 --> 31:19.345
All right. Weapons on stun.

31:19.378 --> 31:20.713
(weapons beep)

31:20.746 --> 31:22.281
What's the plan?

31:22.315 --> 31:23.716
I don't know.

31:30.923 --> 31:32.425
Oh, my God, Nick?

31:32.458 --> 31:34.260
Nick Lewis?

31:34.293 --> 31:35.528
It's Ed, from college lacrosse.

31:35.561 --> 31:36.929
How are you?

31:36.962 --> 31:38.131
Step back from the door.
My God.

31:38.164 --> 31:39.932
Look at you.
You're a guard now, huh?

31:39.965 --> 31:40.933
How long you been guarding?

31:40.966 --> 31:42.635
Step back now.

31:42.668 --> 31:44.137
What kind of talk is that?

31:44.170 --> 31:45.104
Give me a hug, you big joker.

31:46.772 --> 31:49.242
Ah, there we go.
That's what I'm looking for.

31:49.275 --> 31:51.076
God, it's good
to see you!

31:51.110 --> 31:54.647
You're more resilient
than you look.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.383
I've been through a divorce.
This is nothing.

31:57.416 --> 31:58.917
Do you know what
my colleague here

31:58.951 --> 32:00.653
is holding in his hand?

32:00.686 --> 32:03.222
Scale model of your penis?
That's good.

32:03.256 --> 32:04.723
Get it all out now.

32:04.757 --> 32:06.225
In that syringe
is a compound

32:06.259 --> 32:08.661
that we find to be
a very effective

32:08.694 --> 32:10.429
truth serum.

32:10.463 --> 32:12.665
You see, it targets
nerve endings.

32:12.698 --> 32:14.467
Imagine

32:14.500 --> 32:17.002
every nerve in your body
feeling as if

32:17.035 --> 32:18.003
it's being punctured by

32:18.036 --> 32:19.605
a tiny little drill.

32:19.638 --> 32:21.907
No...

32:21.940 --> 32:23.942
don't imagine.

32:23.976 --> 32:25.711
Feel it.
(grunts)

32:28.847 --> 32:30.349
(crying out)

32:32.117 --> 32:33.819
This is the antidote.

32:36.389 --> 32:39.158
All you have to do is
tell me where the others are.

32:39.192 --> 32:40.593
(cries out)

32:40.626 --> 32:42.461
(gasping)

32:42.495 --> 32:44.363
The choice is yours.

32:44.397 --> 32:45.964
(screaming)

33:02.881 --> 33:04.082
(Kelly screams)

33:06.151 --> 33:08.787
HAMELAC:
What, no jokes?

33:08.821 --> 33:10.889
You were so amusing before.

33:10.923 --> 33:12.024
(Kelly screams)

33:14.893 --> 33:16.662
(pained cries)

33:16.695 --> 33:18.964
Kel. Kelly. CLAIRE:
What's wrong?

33:18.997 --> 33:20.533
(straining) Uh... What's
happening to you?

33:20.566 --> 33:21.634
What the hell
did you do to her?

33:21.667 --> 33:22.701
Talk!

33:24.503 --> 33:25.804
Now.

33:25.838 --> 33:27.406
(straining):
All right. All right.

33:27.440 --> 33:28.907
All right, damn you,
give her this.

33:29.842 --> 33:31.744
(whimpering)

33:33.111 --> 33:35.714
(gasps)
Oh, thank God.

33:41.787 --> 33:43.489
You must be Hamelac.

33:43.522 --> 33:44.823
Nice name.

33:44.857 --> 33:46.525
Just kidding,
it's not.

33:46.559 --> 33:47.993
ALARA: You have
a pretty messed up way

33:48.026 --> 33:49.528
of welcoming
your guests.

33:49.562 --> 33:51.163
Especially when all we were
trying to do is help you.

33:51.196 --> 33:53.098
Why would we need
your help?

33:53.131 --> 33:55.268
Hamelac, your
entire world is

33:55.301 --> 33:57.270
a massive bio-vessel
adrift in space.

33:57.303 --> 33:59.572
And in less than
six months,

33:59.605 --> 34:01.940
it's gonna be sucked
into the gravity well of a star.

34:01.974 --> 34:04.009
You're insane.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.178
No, you're insane
if you don't listen to us.

34:06.211 --> 34:08.881
We come from another ship.
We encountered your vessel...

34:08.914 --> 34:11.884
Do not blaspheme
in these chambers.

34:11.917 --> 34:13.619
Dorahl's creation
is all.

34:13.652 --> 34:16.088
He can pretend all he wants,
but he knows the truth.

34:16.121 --> 34:18.257
Or at least he suspects.

34:18.291 --> 34:20.225
The kid's right. Why else
would he have tortured me?

34:20.259 --> 34:21.594
He knows what we are.

34:21.627 --> 34:23.262
Well?

34:23.296 --> 34:25.264
Is it possible that there's more

34:25.298 --> 34:27.900
to the universe
than what we see?

34:27.933 --> 34:29.201
Yes, it's possible!

34:29.234 --> 34:30.469
CLAIRE:
Then, for God's sake,

34:30.503 --> 34:32.037
why don't you
let us help you?

34:32.070 --> 34:33.472
We can try to repair
your ship.

34:33.506 --> 34:37.042
To do as you say
would shatter

34:37.075 --> 34:39.712
our entire way of life.

34:39.745 --> 34:41.314
This world is not ready.

34:41.347 --> 34:42.448
No, you mean you're not ready

34:42.481 --> 34:44.049
to give up control
over these people.

34:44.082 --> 34:45.984
What part of
"you're going to die"

34:46.018 --> 34:47.420
don't you understand?

34:47.453 --> 34:49.822
Am I supposed to just
take your word

34:49.855 --> 34:52.325
that we're headed
for catastrophe

34:52.358 --> 34:53.659
without proof?

34:53.692 --> 34:56.629
You want proof?
I'll give you proof.

34:56.662 --> 34:59.231
Look at this.
That's our ship, the Orville.

34:59.264 --> 35:00.599
Isn't that pretty? Look at
that, with all the curves

35:00.633 --> 35:01.967
and everything. It's
real nice, right?

35:02.000 --> 35:02.835
Now, look at this.

35:02.868 --> 35:04.737
That's your ship. Huh?

35:04.770 --> 35:06.672
Looks like a big metal
turtle, doesn't it?

35:06.705 --> 35:08.240
That's where you live.

35:08.273 --> 35:10.409
I will not destabilize
a system

35:10.443 --> 35:12.778
that has kept order
for thousands of years.

35:12.811 --> 35:15.781
Torture, public execution--
that's what you call order?

35:17.816 --> 35:21.354
Well, then, I guess
we'll be on our way.

35:21.387 --> 35:23.356
You'll understand that
we don't want you

35:23.389 --> 35:25.290
sending the cops
out after us.

35:25.324 --> 35:26.158
Have a nice nap.

35:42.575 --> 35:44.777
This is what
we wanted you to see.

35:44.810 --> 35:46.545
It is a forbidden place.

35:46.579 --> 35:49.014
None of us have ever known
what it is.

35:49.047 --> 35:50.649
It appears similar in design

35:50.683 --> 35:52.050
to the hatchway
we encountered

35:52.084 --> 35:53.452
when we entered the ship.

35:53.486 --> 35:56.489
However, this keypad
seems to be functioning.

35:56.522 --> 35:58.624
If I can access
the internal circuits,

35:58.657 --> 36:00.393
the code should be
easily obtainable.

36:07.433 --> 36:09.001
(beeping)

36:33.025 --> 36:34.927
ISAAC:
It is a lift, Captain.

36:39.398 --> 36:40.899
Up or down?

36:40.933 --> 36:42.935
Let's try up.

36:56.148 --> 36:58.250
Any weekend plans?

36:58.283 --> 37:00.018
Um, not really.

37:00.052 --> 37:02.220
Might call my sister.

37:02.254 --> 37:05.858
Cool.

37:05.891 --> 37:09.194
Coo-cool.
Coo-coo-cool.

37:09.227 --> 37:10.529
A thousand light-years
from Earth,

37:10.563 --> 37:12.931
and you're still awkward
in the elevator.

37:22.475 --> 37:23.876
ISAAC:
Captain,

37:23.909 --> 37:26.479
I believe we are on
the bridge of the ship.

37:29.948 --> 37:31.717
What's that?

37:31.750 --> 37:35.053
Kid, that is space.

37:35.087 --> 37:38.090
KEMKA: I used to imagine
how it would be.

37:38.123 --> 37:40.292
It was nothing like this.

37:40.325 --> 37:42.961
How far does it extend?

37:42.995 --> 37:44.296
No one knows.

37:44.329 --> 37:46.331
Probably to infinity.

37:46.364 --> 37:49.101
ISAAC: Captain, I have accessed
a recording

37:49.134 --> 37:51.837
left here by
the last occupant.

37:51.870 --> 37:55.273
To anyone hearing
the sound of my voice,

37:55.307 --> 37:58.010
this is Captain Jahavus Dorahl.

37:58.043 --> 38:00.445
Dorahl...

38:12.625 --> 38:15.360
This vessel was constructed
by my people

38:15.393 --> 38:18.531
as a first attempt
to visit another planet.

38:18.564 --> 38:20.599
Our world is remote,

38:20.633 --> 38:23.468
and we knew that a journey
to even the nearest

38:23.502 --> 38:26.471
habitable world would take
over a century.

38:26.505 --> 38:28.641
Three generations
would live out their lives

38:28.674 --> 38:30.475
on board this bio-vessel.

38:30.509 --> 38:34.212
The third would be the
one to reach our destination.

38:34.246 --> 38:36.381
But we were hit by an ion storm,

38:36.414 --> 38:39.051
and we've been unable
to restart our engines.

38:39.084 --> 38:43.155
We are marooned in space
and drifting.

38:43.188 --> 38:45.223
Unless we can repair the damage,

38:45.257 --> 38:47.192
this ship is now our home.

38:47.225 --> 38:51.063
Our air is recycled,
so we will not suffocate.

38:51.096 --> 38:53.465
Our food and water supply
is sustainable

38:53.498 --> 38:55.734
for thousands of years,
if need be,

38:55.768 --> 38:59.572
as we are a self-contained
artificial ecosystem.

38:59.605 --> 39:01.540
But unless we encounter help,

39:01.574 --> 39:03.842
we are doomed to drift
indefinitely.

39:03.876 --> 39:07.680
For space is vast

39:07.713 --> 39:11.216
and very dark and very lonely.

39:13.619 --> 39:15.353
My God.

39:15.387 --> 39:18.857
This society
was never supposed to exist.

39:18.891 --> 39:21.860
They evolved and grew until they
simply forgot their origins.

39:21.894 --> 39:23.095
Forgot they were on a ship.

39:23.128 --> 39:24.529
How is that possible?

39:24.563 --> 39:26.098
Well, if enough time passes.

39:26.131 --> 39:27.399
Even Earth is a little fuzzy

39:27.432 --> 39:29.868
on some of its own history.

39:29.902 --> 39:32.070
Damage records indicate
the engine failure

39:32.104 --> 39:34.239
is quite rectifiable.

39:34.272 --> 39:36.441
It should take no more
than 24 hours.

39:36.474 --> 39:38.510
24 hours.

39:38.543 --> 39:40.579
After two millennia.

39:40.613 --> 39:42.447
ISAAC: There is one
more thing, Captain.

39:42.480 --> 39:44.449
According to the ship's
schematics,

39:44.482 --> 39:46.251
it appears a portion
of the upper surface

39:46.284 --> 39:48.253
of the hull is retractable.

39:48.286 --> 39:50.689
You're saying this thing has
a sunroof?

39:50.723 --> 39:51.857
Yes, sir.

39:51.890 --> 39:54.059
Presumably to simulate night.

39:54.092 --> 39:56.895
So they could look up
and see real stars.

39:56.929 --> 39:58.931
What's night?

40:01.099 --> 40:02.500
Open it.

40:09.675 --> 40:11.343
(rumbling)

40:43.341 --> 40:46.078
CLAIRE:
"If the stars should appear

40:46.111 --> 40:48.446
"one night in a thousand years,

40:48.480 --> 40:51.016
"how would men believe
and adore

40:51.049 --> 40:53.686
"and preserve for many
generations

40:53.719 --> 40:56.755
the remembrance
of the City of God..."

40:56.789 --> 40:58.691
Is that Shakespeare?

40:58.724 --> 41:01.093
Emerson.

41:01.126 --> 41:03.461
William Byron Emerson,
yes, yes.

41:03.495 --> 41:05.497
Ralph Waldo...
Ralph Waldo.

41:05.530 --> 41:10.502
Lord Ralph Waldo
Keats... David Thoreau, yes.

41:10.535 --> 41:12.337
Sir,

41:12.370 --> 41:14.139
communications
are now clear.

41:14.172 --> 41:15.808
We are being signaled
by the Orville.

41:15.841 --> 41:17.375
They have returned.

41:17.409 --> 41:18.944
Captain...

41:18.977 --> 41:20.645
what do we do now?

41:20.679 --> 41:22.547
Well, we're gonna contact
the Union fleet

41:22.580 --> 41:24.549
and have them send
a special training crew

41:24.582 --> 41:26.218
to help reacquaint you
with your own ship.

41:26.251 --> 41:28.153
You'll be driving this thing
yourself in no time.

41:28.186 --> 41:30.388
Where you go
is up to you.

41:30.422 --> 41:32.891
Thank you.

41:32.925 --> 41:34.392
For everything.

41:34.426 --> 41:35.728
KELLY:
Don't thank us.

41:35.761 --> 41:37.730
We just gave you back
what was already yours.

41:37.763 --> 41:39.231
Yes.

41:40.999 --> 41:43.068
Our future.
