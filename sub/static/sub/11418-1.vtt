WEBVTT

01:13.375 --> 01:15.582
Welcome to bonnie Scotland.

01:15.666 --> 01:19.207
It is the year of Our Lord 1828.

01:19.291 --> 01:20.832
And this is where I work,

01:20.916 --> 01:23.749
the market square in Edinburgh,
our capital city.

01:26.791 --> 01:29.582
They're calling this
the Scottish Enlightenment.

01:30.708 --> 01:33.207
Enlightenment?

01:33.291 --> 01:34.499
You could have fooled me.

01:34.958 --> 01:37.207
I mean,
look at the state of them.

01:38.125 --> 01:40.332
The only people round here
looking to be enlightened

01:40.416 --> 01:41.790
are the medical students.

01:41.875 --> 01:45.249
They come to study
at the feet of our famous doctors.

01:45.333 --> 01:48.165
Edinburgh is the medical capital
of the world.

01:48.291 --> 01:50.790
Get yourselves
an education there, lads.

01:50.875 --> 01:55.415
On one side of the city,
you have Barclay's School of Anatomy,

01:55.500 --> 01:59.749
And that's run by the esteemed surgeon
Doctor Robert Knox.

01:59.833 --> 02:04.249
Now some say that he's the finest
surgeon in all of Scotland.

02:04.333 --> 02:08.582
All I can say about Doctor Knox
is that he dresses well.

02:08.666 --> 02:10.624
Quite the dandy.

02:10.708 --> 02:15.249
Ah, there's nothing like starting off
a new term with a fresh corpse.

02:15.333 --> 02:17.249
- Is there, Patterson?
- Indeed, sir.

02:17.333 --> 02:21.707
Today I think I shall commence
by removing the top of the cranium.

02:21.791 --> 02:24.499
It will certainly give the freshmen
something to write home about.

02:24.583 --> 02:28.249
And on the other side of the city...

02:28.333 --> 02:31.207
you've got Scotland's
Royal College of Surgeons.

02:31.291 --> 02:34.707
And that's run
by Professor Alexander Monro.

02:34.791 --> 02:36.749
He's...

02:36.833 --> 02:39.957
how do you put it?
Old-school.

02:52.625 --> 02:55.332
That would be an artery.

02:58.500 --> 03:02.749
Anyway, you'll have to excuse me
for a wee moment, ladies and gentlemen.

03:03.500 --> 03:05.749
It's... showtime.

03:24.625 --> 03:29.582
Maggie O'Donnell of the West Port,
also known as Mad Maggie.

03:29.666 --> 03:32.874
You are convicted of the heinous crimes
of thievery,

03:32.958 --> 03:40.124
prostitution, public drunkenness,
and a bad attitude.

03:40.208 --> 03:43.624
Do you have anything to say
before you are consigned to hell?

03:43.708 --> 03:44.749
Aye!

03:44.833 --> 03:49.957
Only that I hope it's as hot down
there as they say it is!

04:03.125 --> 04:06.874
You see, you can only teach anatomy
by cutting up people's bodies.

04:06.958 --> 04:09.207
And the law of the land says
you can only cut up bodies

04:09.291 --> 04:13.082
of people like Mad Maggie here,
the recently deceased.

04:13.166 --> 04:15.332
So we sell them
to the highest bidder.

04:23.583 --> 04:27.624
But now, Professor Monro,
the swine,

04:27.708 --> 04:30.957
has used his influence
to pass a new city bylaw.

04:39.208 --> 04:40.332
Where's the body, Angus?

04:42.875 --> 04:44.415
But we had an arrangement.

04:44.500 --> 04:47.290
Professor Monro at the Royal College
gets all the bodies now.

04:51.208 --> 04:54.749
Now when the demand for
a certain commodity exceeds supply,

04:54.833 --> 04:57.499
it creates a business opportunity

04:57.583 --> 05:01.874
just waiting for the right kind
of clever entrepreneurs to step in.

05:02.833 --> 05:06.332
Ladies and gentlemen, gather round!
Gather round!

05:06.416 --> 05:07.999
My name is William Burke.

05:08.083 --> 05:10.374
Like many of you,
my colleague Mr. Hare and I

05:10.458 --> 05:12.207
came to this land looking for work.

05:12.291 --> 05:15.999
We've dug canals, we've built roads,
we've started a new life.

05:16.083 --> 05:20.165
But none of us has forgotten that
Emerald Isle from which we came.

05:20.250 --> 05:22.040
That mystical land where a man...

05:22.125 --> 05:24.332
- Get to the bloody point, Willy.
- Right, sorry.

05:24.416 --> 05:27.915
In the County of Donegal,
on the highest, greenest slopes,

05:28.000 --> 05:31.499
there grows a certain moss
which any educated person will tell you

05:31.583 --> 05:33.374
cures all known afflictions.

05:33.458 --> 05:36.540
The smallest cut,
ladies and gentlemen,

05:36.625 --> 05:38.665
can let in poisons from the earth
and the air,

05:38.750 --> 05:41.957
and before you know it,
your very brain starts to boil.

05:42.041 --> 05:46.457
But a touch of the moss from the hills
of Donegal, ladies and gentlemen,

05:46.541 --> 05:48.957
and it's gone in a flash.

05:49.041 --> 05:51.207
A boil appears.
You pay it no mind.

05:52.541 --> 05:54.582
But suddenly there's a second!
And a third!

05:55.708 --> 05:58.582
And before you know it,
the sufferings of Job are upon you!

05:58.666 --> 06:02.249
A wart, madam.
Starts off small, doesn't it?

06:02.333 --> 06:07.040
But without a touch of the moss,
it can grow as big as your head!

06:07.125 --> 06:09.457
This is never moss.

06:09.541 --> 06:11.957
It's cheese mould.

06:12.041 --> 06:14.624
They're a pair of confidence men!

06:16.375 --> 06:17.790
You bastards!

06:17.875 --> 06:20.707
Fetch a constable!

06:32.750 --> 06:33.915
Gentlemen!

06:47.666 --> 06:53.415
Gentlemen, the Lord created
the heavens and the earth.

06:53.500 --> 06:59.957
But His greatest work,
His most perfect creation is Man.

07:00.041 --> 07:04.249
The study of human anatomy,
therefore,

07:04.333 --> 07:10.957
is nothing less than a direct insight
into the mind of God.

07:18.125 --> 07:19.249
Gentlemen...

07:19.333 --> 07:24.374
I give you the human form...

07:24.458 --> 07:26.124
in all its glory.

07:26.208 --> 07:27.332
Jesus Christ!

07:32.541 --> 07:35.457
I've a very,
very good explanation, sir.

07:38.416 --> 07:39.624
Well, Patterson?

07:39.708 --> 07:42.957
Let's hear this very,
very good explanation.

07:51.750 --> 07:54.624
Not content with butchering
his own patients,

07:54.708 --> 07:57.082
Monro has now taken
to using political influence

07:57.166 --> 07:59.540
to hinder the advancement
of medical science.

07:59.625 --> 08:01.040
Beggars can't be choosers, sir.

08:01.125 --> 08:03.749
I had to take the only one that
Resurrectionist McTavish had left.

08:03.833 --> 08:06.665
That's the third rotter I've had
from McTavish and his gang

08:06.750 --> 08:08.540
of grave robbers
in the last three weeks.

08:08.625 --> 08:10.040
I can't go on like this.

08:10.125 --> 08:12.540
Is there anything I can do,
doctor?

08:12.625 --> 08:18.832
You could start praying, Patterson,
for the one thing that could save us.

08:18.916 --> 08:20.165
And what's that, sir?

08:20.250 --> 08:24.082
An enormous and awful calamity
right here in Edinburgh.

08:24.166 --> 08:27.624
An accident or a...
or a natural disaster.

08:28.541 --> 08:32.914
Something which generates the large
numbers of cadavers I need for my work.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.539
Wouldn't that be nice, sir?

08:34.625 --> 08:36.999
Yes, Patterson.

08:37.332 --> 08:39.874
It would be nice.

08:39.957 --> 08:41.874
You told your wife
you was gonna get a job.

08:41.957 --> 08:42.999
You lied.

08:43.082 --> 08:45.874
An economy with the truth, Willy,
isn't the same as a flat-out lie.

08:45.958 --> 08:49.332
And you think Lucky's
gonna grasp that distinction?

08:49.416 --> 08:51.082
She's not exactly
a forgiving woman.

08:51.166 --> 08:53.040
I'll not hear a bad word
said against her.

08:53.125 --> 08:54.165
All right.

08:54.250 --> 08:57.165
I'll grant you she's had her problems
with the bottle,

08:57.250 --> 09:00.415
but she's fighting her demons.

09:00.500 --> 09:03.249
Besides she's bound to be
in high spirits.

09:03.333 --> 09:05.332
- It's rent day for Old Donald.
- Ah!

09:05.416 --> 09:07.290
Ah, ya see?

09:07.375 --> 09:10.499
Within every cloud,
there's a silver lining.

09:12.791 --> 09:15.374
Where's the money you owe us,
Mr. Hare?!

09:27.291 --> 09:30.790
I know this looks bad, love,
but there's a good explanation.

09:30.875 --> 09:34.665
You see, Willy here came up
with this fantastic new product.

09:34.750 --> 09:37.790
- Donegal moss.
- It started off a roaring success.

09:37.875 --> 09:40.624
Aye, for a while it looked as though
all our troubles were over.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.332
Jesus, what's that smell?

09:46.416 --> 09:48.290
Er, it was an accident.

09:48.375 --> 09:51.957
You're a lazy good-for-nothing,
William Hare.

09:52.041 --> 09:54.124
We're flat-out broke.

09:55.416 --> 09:57.665
What about Old Donald's rent money?

10:00.958 --> 10:03.624
He's dead.

10:03.708 --> 10:05.249
- Dead.
- Dead!

10:05.333 --> 10:06.749
What do you mean "dead"?

10:06.833 --> 10:08.749
I mean deceased.
He stopped living and died.

10:10.250 --> 10:11.915
So he didn't pay his rent, then?

10:13.291 --> 10:15.790
Are you telling us Old Donald
is dead?

10:15.875 --> 10:16.957
As a doornail.

10:17.041 --> 10:20.999
So my suggestion is that you sort
yourselves out

10:21.083 --> 10:23.499
and get rid of the body
before it starts to stink up the place

10:23.583 --> 10:25.540
more than you two.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.457
How are we supposed to do that?

10:27.541 --> 10:30.040
Use your imagination, William.

10:30.125 --> 10:32.665
It's about all you're good for
these days.

10:37.625 --> 10:39.457
That's not working.

10:41.583 --> 10:44.207
- Right, now push his right leg down.
- It won't go!

10:44.291 --> 10:47.290
- Gonna have to break his back.
- What?!

10:47.375 --> 10:49.332
Well, it's either that,
or we chop his legs off.

10:51.708 --> 10:53.249
I know a building site in the New Town.

10:53.333 --> 10:54.790
We can dump him there.
No problem at all.

10:54.875 --> 10:58.082
- Don't know about this, William.
- It'll be a piece of cake.

10:58.166 --> 11:01.165
- It's only another mile or so.
- Only another mile or so?

11:03.500 --> 11:06.124
Let's stop over there, William.
This is thirsty work.

11:14.291 --> 11:16.207
Right, get it up.

11:21.375 --> 11:25.874
Watch your language,
you fuckin' son-of-a-bitch bastard!

11:39.583 --> 11:42.790
What are we gonna do, William?
There's no more canals to dig.

11:42.875 --> 11:46.415
Don't you worry, Willy.
I have got all kinds of ideas.

11:46.500 --> 11:48.999
Aye, but no money to speak of.
No plan.

11:52.291 --> 11:53.957
Just enough money
for one last dram.

11:54.041 --> 11:56.165
I'll drink to that.

12:01.916 --> 12:04.040
- Couple of large ones, Eileen.
- Right away.

12:04.125 --> 12:06.499
Willy!
How's business?

12:06.583 --> 12:07.874
Never better, Fergus.

12:12.333 --> 12:13.790
What about you?

12:13.875 --> 12:16.540
Diversifying is what we're doing.

12:16.625 --> 12:21.207
Mr. McTavish has moved into gambling,
opium distribution and...

12:21.291 --> 12:23.207
pimping whores.

12:27.125 --> 12:29.207
We've gone legitimate.

12:32.208 --> 12:33.832
So no more digging up graves,
then?

12:33.916 --> 12:36.040
Eh, it's nae worth
the bother anymore.

12:36.125 --> 12:39.165
Wee Tam McLintoch
and his militia,

12:39.250 --> 12:41.957
they've declared a war
on grave robbery.

12:42.041 --> 12:44.915
They're patrolling the graveyards
every night.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.749
It's a shame, really.

12:46.833 --> 12:51.582
We used to sell to Doctor Knox
at 3 pounds a cadaver.

12:51.666 --> 12:56.790
And these days,
he'd be happy to pay double that.

12:56.875 --> 12:59.499
And I thought life round here
was supposed to be cheap?

12:59.583 --> 13:00.874
It is.

13:03.458 --> 13:07.499
But the price rockets
once you're dead.

13:19.208 --> 13:20.290
Willy...

13:23.750 --> 13:28.040
So, this doctor is gonna give us money
to cut Old Donald up?

13:28.125 --> 13:31.665
Old Donald is in heaven.
These are just his mortal remains.

13:31.750 --> 13:33.582
You seem to have given this
an awful lot of thought.

13:33.666 --> 13:35.040
When have I ever let you down?

13:35.125 --> 13:38.040
- When have you ever let me down?!
- Oh, come on now, Willy.

13:38.125 --> 13:39.582
Oh!

14:12.875 --> 14:14.499
Holy shite!

14:25.583 --> 14:27.165
This is wrong.

14:27.250 --> 14:29.124
There's only one Surgeon's Square
in Edinburgh, Willy.

14:29.208 --> 14:31.290
No, what we're doing is wrong.

14:31.375 --> 14:32.957
I'm sorry to disturb you, Doctor,

14:33.041 --> 14:34.832
but we've two gentlemen
at the door to see you.

14:34.916 --> 14:36.957
They appear to have
a herring barrel with them, sir.

14:37.041 --> 14:39.874
I have no taste for herring, Patterson.
Send them away.

14:39.958 --> 14:43.415
I believe there's something else
in their herring barrel for you, sir.

14:46.583 --> 14:49.082
I commend you both
on account of his freshness.

14:49.166 --> 14:50.874
Thank you, Doctor.

14:50.958 --> 14:52.665
Why is he bent in half like that?

14:53.875 --> 14:58.415
Er, this man obviously died
in some kind of construction accident.

14:58.500 --> 15:01.790
That is exactly what hap... isn't that
exactly what happened, Mr. Burke?

15:01.875 --> 15:04.957
Aye, Mr. Hare, yeah,
that's exactly what happened.

15:05.041 --> 15:08.040
Right.
I'll give you 3 pounds.

15:08.125 --> 15:11.082
We was looking for 6 pounds, sir.

15:11.166 --> 15:13.749
I'm afraid I can go no higher
than 4 pounds 10 shillings.

15:13.833 --> 15:17.415
Doctor Knox, sir, y-you yourself
complimented us on account of its...

15:17.500 --> 15:19.165
freshness, sir.

15:20.458 --> 15:23.082
Quite the salesman, aren't you,
uh, Mr. Hare?

15:23.166 --> 15:25.540
Could you make it
5 pounds 10 shillings?

15:25.625 --> 15:31.040
What with so much... construction work
going on in Edinburgh,

15:31.125 --> 15:35.457
if we were to, uh, stumble on
any other unfortunates...

15:36.791 --> 15:38.457
would you be interested,
Doctor?

15:40.458 --> 15:43.665
I'll give you 5 pounds for your efforts,
gentlemen.

15:43.750 --> 15:47.124
And I'll pay you the same for any more
unfortunates that you can deliver,

15:47.208 --> 15:50.332
Except in the summer, when we have
a few problems keeping them fresh.

15:50.416 --> 15:52.374
I completely understand,
Doctor Knox.

15:52.458 --> 15:55.957
All right, Patterson.
Prepare this gentleman for the lecture.

15:56.041 --> 16:00.040
What about his, uh...
posture, sir?

16:00.125 --> 16:03.165
Uh, straighten him out.
I'm sure he won't complain.

16:03.250 --> 16:04.874
Sir?

16:04.958 --> 16:07.082
Unbend him.
These fellows will assist you.

16:07.166 --> 16:08.374
And then show them out.
Goodnight.

16:08.458 --> 16:10.915
All right,
give me a hand with this.

16:26.291 --> 16:29.540
Here's to our new product.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.749
And where exactly
are we gonna find more?

16:35.833 --> 16:41.290
Oh, there's lots more... product
just waiting for us to dig it up.

17:08.083 --> 17:10.499
He's looking at me.

17:10.583 --> 17:12.665
I'm sure he knows
what we're doing.

17:12.750 --> 17:16.040
Forget the damn dog, Willy.
Just keep an eye out for the militia.

17:19.250 --> 17:23.415
- You know this is hallowed ground.
- Touch of frost is all.

17:31.375 --> 17:32.957
Look lively, men.

17:58.583 --> 18:00.165
Who goes there?!

18:00.250 --> 18:01.582
Fix bayonets!

18:04.583 --> 18:05.957
It's the militia!

18:10.583 --> 18:11.624
Listen up, lads!

18:11.708 --> 18:12.915
Agh!

18:13.000 --> 18:14.457
They got guns!

18:16.250 --> 18:18.665
Oh, for pity's sake, Private.

18:21.041 --> 18:22.249
Come on.

18:24.375 --> 18:25.874
Be careful.

18:29.041 --> 18:32.665
Either we give ourselves up
and risk being transported,

18:32.750 --> 18:35.624
or we run for it
and risk getting shot.

18:35.708 --> 18:38.790
As much as I like to travel,
I think I'm gonna go with the latter.

18:38.875 --> 18:41.582
- On three.
- Right. One...

18:48.791 --> 18:50.290
Ow!!

18:50.375 --> 18:51.582
Well shot, sir!

18:51.666 --> 18:52.874
Thank you, Sergeant.

19:03.625 --> 19:05.540
I can't believe this.

19:05.625 --> 19:08.999
Six years in the Donegal Militia,
and I never got a scratch.

19:09.083 --> 19:11.957
And three hours as a grave robber,
and I get shot in the arse.

19:12.041 --> 19:13.874
All right, Willy,
show me your wounds.

19:13.958 --> 19:16.165
All right, just be careful.

19:18.708 --> 19:21.957
I think you've got a perfectly
lovely arse.

19:25.208 --> 19:26.499
Evening, Mrs. McFie.

19:30.166 --> 19:31.332
Is it bad?

19:31.416 --> 19:33.624
It's nothing but a scratch,
you big baby.

19:33.708 --> 19:35.874
- Well, it still hurts.
- Come on, Willy.

19:35.958 --> 19:38.499
Oh, who was that screaming
in the graveyard like a wee girl?

19:38.583 --> 19:39.707
You!

19:50.291 --> 19:53.832
For the love of Lord Jesus.
She's fallen off the wagon again.

20:01.583 --> 20:02.832
Are you all right, love?

20:06.416 --> 20:07.999
It's God.

20:08.083 --> 20:09.332
He's punishing us.

20:09.416 --> 20:11.749
Oh, you know that's not true.

20:11.833 --> 20:14.832
First Old Donald.
Now Joseph.

20:14.916 --> 20:16.957
What's happened to Joseph?

20:17.041 --> 20:20.749
That's two rents just gone.

20:41.125 --> 20:42.874
Hello?

20:42.958 --> 20:44.957
Are you all right, Joseph?

20:46.750 --> 20:51.207
Do I look all right,
you bleedin' Irish bastards?!

20:54.083 --> 20:55.999
You'll no' be takin' my coat.

20:58.458 --> 21:00.374
I remember.

21:00.458 --> 21:02.874
Old Nosey was there himself.

21:02.958 --> 21:06.124
He says, "Stand up, guards.

21:06.208 --> 21:10.165
Now, Maitland, now's your time."

21:10.250 --> 21:15.499
And over we go, fightin',
fightin' the Frogs.

21:15.583 --> 21:18.290
Did I ever tell you about the time...

21:20.041 --> 21:22.624
The time...

21:22.708 --> 21:28.124
I saw the man, the wee man himself,
Napoleon?

21:28.208 --> 21:30.457
Aye, it were a treat.

21:32.666 --> 21:34.415
And that idiotic hat.

21:42.583 --> 21:45.957
Forgive me, Father...

21:46.041 --> 21:47.874
for I know not what I do.

21:49.416 --> 21:51.540
He shouldn't have to go like this.

21:53.416 --> 21:55.707
A hero should be laid to rest among
his comrades

21:55.791 --> 21:58.249
in the corner of some distant
foreign field,

21:58.333 --> 22:01.332
on the battleground surrounded
by his fellow men-at-arms.

22:02.833 --> 22:05.457
No, Willy, it's far better this way.

22:05.541 --> 22:09.707
A man deserves to die in the comfort of
his own bed surrounded by his friends.

22:57.291 --> 22:58.582
Never again, William.

22:58.666 --> 23:00.249
Old Joseph
was the last one for me.

23:00.333 --> 23:01.749
Look, we'll talk about it later, Willy.

23:01.833 --> 23:04.124
For now just smile
and try to look important.

23:29.541 --> 23:32.582
- Er, excusez-moi...
- You're not coming in wearing those.

23:33.791 --> 23:38.624
- But they are French.
- Exactly. So sling your hook.

23:38.708 --> 23:40.374
- Pardon?
- Sling your hook.

23:40.458 --> 23:41.832
- Hook?
- Your hook.

23:41.916 --> 23:43.790
- Hook?
- Your hook, sling it.

23:46.708 --> 23:48.749
- We're on the guest list.
- Name?

23:51.750 --> 23:53.457
William Wordsworth.

23:55.166 --> 23:56.290
Plus one.

23:57.750 --> 24:00.249
Welcome to McOakley's,
Mr. Wordsworth.

24:00.333 --> 24:04.749
And may I say how much I admired
your poem about the daffodils.

24:04.833 --> 24:06.499
Oh, too kind.

24:06.583 --> 24:09.415
Very nice, very nice.
Aye.

24:10.875 --> 24:13.040
No chance. Piss off.
Get out.

24:30.750 --> 24:32.040
What are you having?

24:32.125 --> 24:35.165
It's inconceivable
that the height of culture

24:35.250 --> 24:37.999
on offer in Edinburgh
is this bloody dive.

24:38.083 --> 24:42.040
Which is why I'm proposing...
and don't laugh at me...

24:42.125 --> 24:43.582
that we put on...

24:45.000 --> 24:46.332
"Macbeth."

24:47.958 --> 24:53.124
It's got everything.
Sex, murder, magic, betrayal.

24:53.208 --> 24:55.332
I think it's a great idea, Ginny.

24:55.416 --> 24:57.374
- You do?
- I really do.

24:57.458 --> 24:59.707
There's just one problem.

24:59.791 --> 25:01.124
Wasn't Macbeth a king?

25:02.458 --> 25:03.915
Wouldn't that make him a man?

25:05.333 --> 25:10.707
I'm talking about the first all-female
production of a Shakespeare play!

25:10.791 --> 25:13.957
But it costs money to put on a play,
Ginny.

25:14.041 --> 25:15.624
None of us want to go back
on the game.

25:15.708 --> 25:18.874
- Never.
- Nobody's going back on the game.

25:18.958 --> 25:24.832
All we need is for a wealthy and
discerning patron to take the bait.

25:24.916 --> 25:26.874
What are you doing?

25:26.958 --> 25:30.082
That which hath made them drunk
hath made me bold, Em.

25:34.416 --> 25:38.290
Had I but died
an hour before this chance,

25:38.375 --> 25:40.832
I had liv'd a blessed time...

25:40.916 --> 25:43.957
Someone's had a few too many.

25:44.041 --> 25:49.707
Who can be wise, amaz'd,
temp'rate and furious

25:49.791 --> 25:53.249
loyal and neutral in a moment?

25:53.333 --> 25:54.374
No man.

25:54.458 --> 25:56.957
The violent expedition of my love

25:57.041 --> 25:59.374
has outrun the pauser reason.

26:09.541 --> 26:12.415
Have you not heard
of William bloody Shakespeare?

26:13.541 --> 26:16.415
Show some respect!
Bollocks.

26:19.291 --> 26:20.332
Can I help you?

26:20.416 --> 26:24.749
Uh... just, your...
your speech there was...

26:24.833 --> 26:26.499
it was wonderful, madam.

26:32.583 --> 26:35.374
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

26:35.458 --> 26:37.374
Doctor!

26:37.458 --> 26:41.374
You look like the proverbial cat that
swallowed the canary, Doctor Monro.

26:41.458 --> 26:43.249
You must know what this is all about.

26:43.333 --> 26:45.415
I do, actually.

26:45.500 --> 26:48.749
But forgive me, I need to have a word
with Doctor Knox.

26:48.833 --> 26:51.165
I'd be surprised if Knox
would speak to you, now that...

26:51.250 --> 26:54.165
Excuse me Doctor Lister.

26:54.250 --> 26:58.915
And please
do not misunderstand this, but...

26:59.000 --> 27:02.165
your breath is appalling.

27:04.208 --> 27:05.415
Ah!

27:08.250 --> 27:12.249
Doctor Knox.
How wonderful it is to see you.

27:12.333 --> 27:14.040
Yes, I'm sure it is.

27:14.125 --> 27:18.415
And your new students,
are they enjoying your lectures?

27:18.500 --> 27:21.832
Er, not as much as I understand
they're enjoying your wife, sir.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.207
Oh, I hate that man.

27:30.041 --> 27:34.415
Doctors, professors, gentlemen,
please take your seats.

27:41.166 --> 27:42.499
Your attention, gentlemen.

27:43.833 --> 27:48.249
His Majesty will be in residence
at Holyrood Palace in eight weeks' time.

27:48.333 --> 27:50.957
The King has decided that,
in his wisdom,

27:51.041 --> 27:55.915
he will create a competition to further
the progress of medical science.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.665
Accordingly, His Majesty
has decided that during his visit,

27:59.750 --> 28:03.999
he will listen to presentations
from Scotland's leading physicians.

28:04.083 --> 28:07.332
Whomsoever he determines
has made the greatest advances

28:07.416 --> 28:09.207
in the field of medicine,

28:09.291 --> 28:14.874
will be awarded the Royal Seal
and a handsome monetary reward.

28:14.958 --> 28:16.582
Mmm!

28:16.666 --> 28:21.749
This honour will confer immeasurable
economic and social status on Edinburgh,

28:21.833 --> 28:24.332
on Scotland,
on the medical profession,

28:24.416 --> 28:27.499
and, of course, on its recipient.

28:27.583 --> 28:29.290
I thank you, and goodnight.

28:30.583 --> 28:32.957
Lord Harrington, I just...

28:33.041 --> 28:34.082
Yes, I know.

28:34.166 --> 28:38.499
I played Agnes in Molière's
"School For Wives"

28:38.583 --> 28:40.249
at the Garrick Theatre in London.

28:40.333 --> 28:43.332
And after that, times got tough,

28:43.416 --> 28:46.124
and I branched out into...
physical theatre.

28:46.208 --> 28:48.999
- Ah, like acrobatics?
- Sometimes.

28:49.083 --> 28:51.540
Then I became a dancer and a showgirl,

28:51.625 --> 28:54.374
and now I'm trying to produce
my first play.

28:54.458 --> 28:56.374
- Sounds very exciting.
- It is.

28:56.458 --> 28:59.707
I just need to put together
a consortium of investors.

28:59.791 --> 29:03.665
Anyway enough about me.
Let's talk more about you.

29:03.750 --> 29:04.957
What do you do for a living?

29:05.041 --> 29:08.082
Er, I'm in surgical supplies.

29:08.166 --> 29:10.707
Sorry to interrupt, Willy but, eh,
we should be heading home.

29:10.791 --> 29:14.249
- Got an early start.
- It was lovely to meet you, Mr. Burke.

29:14.333 --> 29:16.540
- Well, can I see you again?
- Oh, I'd like that.

29:16.625 --> 29:18.957
- How about Friday night?
- I'll meet you here at 7:00.

29:19.041 --> 29:20.915
Goodnight, miss.
Come along, Willy.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.707
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

29:27.750 --> 29:32.832
I'll not explain myself again.
Mr. Wordsworth is already in the club.

29:32.916 --> 29:35.415
That cannot be.
I am he.

29:35.500 --> 29:38.082
Newly returned from my tour
of the continent.

29:38.166 --> 29:40.290
And I am Samuel Coleridge.

29:40.375 --> 29:43.915
Aye. And I'm Robbie fuckin' Burns!
Now piss off, the both of youse!

29:46.375 --> 29:49.540
Strange and peculiar gentleman.

29:49.625 --> 29:53.624
I never realised there was so much
to know about the human foot.

29:53.708 --> 29:57.082
Doctor Knox? Will you be presenting
to the committee?

29:57.166 --> 29:59.874
I will, my Lord.

29:59.958 --> 30:04.082
And I believe I shall prevail
in His Majesty's competition.

30:04.166 --> 30:06.540
And how will you do that,
Doctor Knox?

30:06.625 --> 30:09.957
I'm creating a complete map
of the human body,

30:10.041 --> 30:11.915
both inside and out.

30:13.416 --> 30:15.249
If such a thing were possible,

30:15.333 --> 30:18.415
it would constitute the greatest
medical advance since Vesalius.

30:18.500 --> 30:20.999
It is also impossible.

30:21.083 --> 30:26.374
Such a map would be entirely useless
unless it was 100% accurate.

30:26.458 --> 30:29.999
And no artist can guarantee that.

30:30.083 --> 30:32.499
No illustrator or painter, I agree.

30:32.583 --> 30:36.624
So how on earth
do you propose to achieve it?

30:36.708 --> 30:40.832
You shall see, Professor,
in the fullness of time.

30:40.916 --> 30:42.457
My Lord.

30:42.541 --> 30:44.707
Come, Patterson.

31:04.458 --> 31:05.624
Vous êtes prêt?

31:05.708 --> 31:08.540
Aye, ready.

31:08.625 --> 31:10.832
- Bon.
- Excuse me, sir.

31:12.208 --> 31:15.124
Uh, Patterson?

31:35.708 --> 31:37.124
Patterson?

31:47.000 --> 31:56.249
Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq,
six, sept, huit, neuf.

31:57.958 --> 31:58.999
Patterson?

32:06.208 --> 32:09.415
Voilà.

32:13.416 --> 32:17.290
Mercí.

32:21.791 --> 32:23.665
Ah! Merde.

32:36.208 --> 32:37.749
Ah!

32:52.166 --> 32:54.207
Voilà.

32:54.291 --> 32:56.082
Excellent.

32:56.166 --> 32:58.582
It is an heliographic,

32:58.666 --> 33:02.499
a device
to capture the image forever.

33:02.583 --> 33:04.499
An heliographic?

33:04.583 --> 33:06.082
Oui.

33:06.166 --> 33:09.665
We shall have to come up
with something better than that.

33:12.750 --> 33:14.707
That was a great night.

33:14.791 --> 33:16.832
Best night of my life.

33:16.916 --> 33:18.749
It was a different world.

33:18.833 --> 33:22.207
A world up high where the air
is balmy and anything's possible.

33:22.291 --> 33:23.790
That's where we belong, Willy.

33:26.041 --> 33:30.207
You know, we should probably keep
this run of good fortune to ourselves.

33:30.291 --> 33:32.165
Just till Lucky straightens herself out.

33:34.291 --> 33:35.415
Not a problem, William.

33:35.500 --> 33:38.749
Besides, for us to come across
any more of those unfortunates,

33:38.833 --> 33:40.832
we'd need the devil's own luck.

33:40.916 --> 33:43.457
That's where you're wrong, Willy.

33:43.541 --> 33:47.249
Men like us make our own luck.

33:47.333 --> 33:48.832
What do you mean?

33:56.750 --> 33:57.999
Have you gone mad?

33:58.083 --> 34:00.874
No, Willy.
We've gone into business.

34:00.958 --> 34:04.665
That doesn't give us the right
to determine another man's fate.

34:04.750 --> 34:07.707
Man is gonna die from the moment
he leaves his mother's womb.

34:07.791 --> 34:10.415
Their fate's already been determined.

34:10.500 --> 34:14.123
All we'd be doing is...
helping them along a bit.

34:18.083 --> 34:19.456
You know...

34:21.083 --> 34:23.623
you look very elegant
in that new suit.

34:25.666 --> 34:27.081
Fine tailoring becomes you.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.081
If you think you're gonna convince me
like that, you're wrong.

34:33.166 --> 34:34.831
I don't care about clothes.

34:34.916 --> 34:36.790
No, but you care about women,
right?

34:36.875 --> 34:41.623
And a fine one costs an arm and a leg,
at the very least.

34:42.958 --> 34:47.873
And that Miss Ginny,
she's a very fine one indeed.

34:50.500 --> 34:51.873
Beautiful.

34:53.416 --> 34:54.456
Talented.

34:55.125 --> 34:58.415
- Not to mention a fine pair...
- All right, you've made your point.

34:58.500 --> 35:00.249
But not like this.

35:00.333 --> 35:03.749
There's a place in the Old Town
that'll suit us fine.

35:42.458 --> 35:45.707
Madam...

35:45.791 --> 35:50.124
l-l-l-I'll...

35:50.208 --> 35:53.332
take the high road...

35:53.416 --> 35:55.040
Right.

35:55.125 --> 35:57.415
The next one we just stab
in the heart with a knife.

35:57.500 --> 35:58.957
No!

35:59.041 --> 36:04.957
And I will be in Scotland afore ye!

36:05.041 --> 36:06.957
Look, I have another idea.

36:24.166 --> 36:26.582
Yah!

36:26.666 --> 36:28.374
Yah!

36:28.458 --> 36:32.082
I say, coachman!
Can't this bloody thing go faster?!

36:32.166 --> 36:33.499
Yah!

36:38.208 --> 36:39.290
They're coming!

36:42.916 --> 36:45.124
Faster, Willy, faster!

36:45.208 --> 36:46.582
Faster!

36:46.666 --> 36:48.290
Yah! Yah!

36:58.416 --> 37:00.874
Come on, Willy.
Put your back into it.

37:02.250 --> 37:04.457
Yah! Yah!

37:12.041 --> 37:14.124
Aaaah!

37:23.458 --> 37:24.957
Fuck me.

37:33.041 --> 37:35.249
I'm telling you, Willy,
it'll be over in a flash.

37:35.333 --> 37:37.374
And I'm telling you
I don't like this one bit.

37:37.458 --> 37:40.665
And I am confident
that this is the only way.

37:40.750 --> 37:44.499
You know, William,
I had confidence in a fart once

37:44.583 --> 37:46.124
and I shat all over myself.

37:53.166 --> 37:57.624
When a body meets a body
comin' through the rye

37:57.708 --> 38:01.540
When a body meets a body,
a body cry?

38:49.375 --> 38:52.915
Who's there?
Is anybody there?!

39:04.125 --> 39:05.499
Agh! Ah!

39:05.583 --> 39:07.124
D'you have a light?

39:14.333 --> 39:16.040
Agh! Ah!

39:38.583 --> 39:40.249
Are you...
are you all right?

39:40.333 --> 39:44.165
This man's untimely
and premature death...

39:44.250 --> 39:47.249
was, as should be fairly obvious
to all of you,

39:47.333 --> 39:52.790
the direct result of gluttony!

39:57.666 --> 39:58.999
I cooked your favourite.

40:03.833 --> 40:06.207
Arbroath smokie and champit tattie.

40:16.625 --> 40:17.915
That's lovely.

40:24.291 --> 40:25.499
Thank you.

40:32.208 --> 40:33.415
I'm not stupid, William.

40:33.500 --> 40:35.874
Three dead bodies
and a pocket full of money?

40:35.958 --> 40:39.290
Doesn't take a genius to work out
what the pair of you have been up to.

40:41.166 --> 40:45.124
I think it's the best bloody idea
you've ever had.

40:46.125 --> 40:49.457
One condition...
I want a pound for every body you sell.

40:49.541 --> 40:54.499
A pound?
- Man starts getting fancy clothes...

40:54.583 --> 40:57.540
also starts getting fancy ideas.

40:57.625 --> 41:01.457
Just think of it as a tax between
a man and a wife.

41:01.541 --> 41:04.624
A kind of nuptial agreement,
if you will.

41:06.750 --> 41:10.374
You may be named Lucky,

41:10.458 --> 41:12.957
but I'm the lucky one, my darlin'.

41:15.625 --> 41:17.915
I'm not listening to you.
I'm watching you.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.207
I'm watching you.

41:19.291 --> 41:24.249
Oh, champagne!
I am impressed, William.

41:24.333 --> 41:26.540
That must have set you back
a pretty penny.

41:26.625 --> 41:28.499
Well... thank you.

41:28.583 --> 41:31.040
- To good news.
- To good news.

41:32.458 --> 41:35.540
- Mmm.
- What good news?

41:35.625 --> 41:37.582
I have decided to finance your play.

41:38.875 --> 41:40.290
No!

41:40.375 --> 41:43.457
Mr. Burke!

41:48.625 --> 41:51.874
Who's that over there
with Ginny Hawkins?

41:54.375 --> 41:57.124
- That's Willy Burke.
- Who?

41:57.208 --> 42:01.415
Regular at The Gravediggers.
Always in the company of William Hare.

42:02.708 --> 42:05.290
They're drinking champagne.

42:05.375 --> 42:08.582
Find out what his racket is.

42:08.666 --> 42:11.707
May I ask what persuaded you
to be so bold

42:11.791 --> 42:15.374
as to invest in an all-female production
of the Scottish play?

42:15.458 --> 42:18.207
You have an incredible talent,
Ginny.

42:18.291 --> 42:20.707
I saw that the night we met.

42:20.791 --> 42:22.874
A talent like that is a gift from God.

42:22.958 --> 42:25.374
To see it go to waste over something
as trivial as money,

42:25.458 --> 42:27.207
that'd be a travesty.

42:27.291 --> 42:32.415
I had no idea you were so passionate
about the theatre, Mr. Burke.

42:32.500 --> 42:35.124
Not the theatre, Ginny.
You.

42:42.958 --> 42:44.957
Thank you for a lovely evening,
Mr. Burke.

42:45.041 --> 42:47.415
Uh, William, please.

42:50.791 --> 42:53.082
Oh, sorry. Um...

42:56.125 --> 42:59.290
When will I be able to see you again,
Ginny?

42:59.375 --> 43:01.040
At the Lyceum Theatre.

43:01.125 --> 43:02.415
Really? When?

43:02.500 --> 43:04.707
When we put down the deposit.

43:07.375 --> 43:08.624
Goodnight, William.

43:23.166 --> 43:25.124
I need to make more money.
Fast.

43:25.208 --> 43:26.624
Don't tell me she charged you
for the night.

43:26.708 --> 43:28.957
She is an actress, not a whore.

43:29.041 --> 43:31.040
What's the difference?

43:31.125 --> 43:33.374
I am gonna finance her play.

43:33.458 --> 43:35.207
Well, with the economy
in its current condition,

43:35.291 --> 43:37.957
I think I'd have to advise
against such a high-risk investment.

43:38.041 --> 43:40.957
Not everything is about money,
William.

43:41.041 --> 43:43.874
William Hare?

43:43.958 --> 43:46.374
This is no time to be resting
on your laurels.

43:46.458 --> 43:49.207
Or to be getting yourself
inebriated.

43:49.291 --> 43:51.124
You got a business to run.

43:51.208 --> 43:54.040
We was just talking about that.
Why don't you join us, love?

43:54.125 --> 43:57.957
- She knows?
- Yes, she does.

43:58.041 --> 44:00.332
Don't worry, Willy.
I can keep me mouth shut.

44:00.416 --> 44:02.040
I'm sorry to take so long.

44:02.125 --> 44:04.249
But I was just having a word
with that old lady over there.

44:04.333 --> 44:05.499
Tragic story.

44:05.583 --> 44:09.624
Just lost her whole family to the pox,
and it's left her homeless.

44:09.708 --> 44:11.249
I'll be back.

44:22.958 --> 44:25.082
Lucky got her drunk.
Now you just hold her still.

44:25.166 --> 44:26.249
I'm trying!

44:27.375 --> 44:31.290
You know, this is how they put wounded
soldiers out of their misery

44:31.375 --> 44:32.665
on the battlefield.

44:32.750 --> 44:36.540
- Oh, aye, what's that called?
- Doesn't really have a name.

44:36.625 --> 44:39.290
- Perhaps we should invent one.
- Just get it over with, William.

44:39.375 --> 44:42.332
I've got it, I've got it...
in honour of my best friend,

44:42.416 --> 44:46.749
from now on this shall be called...

44:46.833 --> 44:48.082
"'Burking."

45:05.166 --> 45:07.832
Help! Help! Help!

45:07.916 --> 45:09.540
Help! Help!

45:15.125 --> 45:17.290
Is she dead?

45:17.375 --> 45:18.832
I think so.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.624
- Yeah, she snuffed it.
- I certainly hope so.

45:40.666 --> 45:44.582
And thou opposed,
being of no woman born,

45:44.666 --> 45:47.332
Yet will I try the last.

45:47.416 --> 45:49.332
Lay on, Macduff!

45:49.416 --> 45:53.124
And damned be him who first cry,
"Hold, enough!"

45:53.208 --> 45:56.249
Thank you, Lucy.
That was...

45:56.333 --> 45:58.832
Please let go.
That was interesting.

45:58.916 --> 46:01.665
Well done.
We'll, um, we'll be in touch.

46:01.750 --> 46:05.249
- Just don't hold your breath.
- Shh, silence, gentlemen.

46:05.333 --> 46:06.957
Sorry.

46:07.041 --> 46:09.499
I thought we'd agreed
you'd keep your mouth shut?

46:09.583 --> 46:11.499
This is costing me enough
without incurring any further delays.

46:11.583 --> 46:12.999
I was just being honest.

46:13.083 --> 46:16.415
This is the theatre, William.
It's not a place for honesty.

46:16.500 --> 46:18.249
Next!

46:18.333 --> 46:23.124
Miss Clarissa Windsor reading
for the part of Macbeth.

46:23.208 --> 46:25.915
Thank you!

46:26.041 --> 46:28.040
We're going to need
another day of auditions.

46:28.125 --> 46:29.374
Maybe even two, Willy.

46:31.708 --> 46:33.957
That's not gonna be a problem,
is it?

46:34.041 --> 46:35.415
Eh... no, no.

46:35.500 --> 46:37.374
You take as much time as you like,
love.

46:37.458 --> 46:39.332
Could you unbutton me, darling?

46:41.541 --> 46:43.207
Aye, uh...

47:09.333 --> 47:12.374
I trust
all is well with your business?

47:12.458 --> 47:14.249
Aye, I...
Can't complain.

47:14.333 --> 47:18.665
I just don't know if we're ever
going to find a convincing Macbeth.

47:18.750 --> 47:20.665
Well, er, I think
you should play the role.

47:23.125 --> 47:26.790
What makes you think I could star
and direct?

47:26.875 --> 47:29.582
Your talent and your vision.

47:29.666 --> 47:33.707
I have been blessed
with a lot of talent.

47:33.791 --> 47:35.457
And I have a vision.

47:35.541 --> 47:38.124
- D'you think?
- I know.

47:53.083 --> 47:54.332
Climb in, Willy.

47:54.416 --> 47:58.124
We're going for a wee chat
with Mr. McTavish.

48:02.583 --> 48:07.540
Let me tell you how things work
in this little city of mine.

48:07.625 --> 48:11.040
Anyone who attempts to start
a new business here

48:11.125 --> 48:14.665
has to agree to pay me
a small percentage of the gross.

48:14.750 --> 48:18.832
And in return,
I make sure you stay out ofjail.

48:18.916 --> 48:22.624
You're not harassed by the authorities,
the competition,

48:22.708 --> 48:26.082
or any other antagonist
that might just come along.

48:26.166 --> 48:28.082
So we pay you for...

48:30.083 --> 48:31.540
protection?

48:33.666 --> 48:36.790
Why, yes, I like that.
Protection.

48:36.875 --> 48:38.999
How much of a percentage
are we talking about?

48:39.083 --> 48:40.957
- 50%.
- Half?!

48:41.041 --> 48:43.290
Don't be unhappy, boys.

48:43.375 --> 48:47.415
Mr. McTavish hasnae yet told you
the good part.

48:47.500 --> 48:51.582
And, uh...
what would be the good part?

48:51.666 --> 48:53.915
You get to remain alive.

49:06.125 --> 49:10.832
We should leave town immediately.
Go to London or America.

49:10.916 --> 49:12.207
I think I might even have
a cousin there.

49:12.291 --> 49:15.249
And quit the most lucrative enterprise
we're ever likely to find?

49:15.333 --> 49:16.915
I don't think so.

49:17.000 --> 49:20.290
Willy, we have identified a demand
and found a supply.

49:20.375 --> 49:21.540
It's perfect.

49:21.625 --> 49:24.040
Yeah, but McTavish is not
the full shilling, is he?

49:24.125 --> 49:26.332
The last thing I want to do
is get into bed with that man.

49:26.416 --> 49:28.582
Ah, but you do wanna get into bed
with Ginny, right?

49:28.666 --> 49:31.124
And to do that, you're gonna have
to stay right here

49:31.208 --> 49:33.624
and continue to finance her play.

49:33.708 --> 49:40.415
Will all great Neptune's ocean
wash this blood clean from my hand?

49:40.500 --> 49:42.665
Ah! No! Aah!

49:42.750 --> 49:47.499
This is my hand will rather
the multitudinous seas incarnadine,

49:47.583 --> 49:49.999
making the green ones red.

49:50.083 --> 49:52.124
My hands are of your colour,

49:52.208 --> 49:55.207
but I am shamed
to wear a heart so white.

49:55.291 --> 49:57.957
- Wait, stop right there.
- Oh, what now?!

49:58.041 --> 50:02.082
No, something's still not quite right.
I need a minute to think.

50:02.166 --> 50:05.165
Ginny, please!
Just say the words!

50:16.583 --> 50:19.499
I can't work out what makes
this character commit murder.

50:21.208 --> 50:24.207
Why, Ginny...
he does it for love.

50:27.583 --> 50:29.707
And power.

50:29.791 --> 50:31.582
Macbeth isn't wholly evil.

50:31.666 --> 50:34.874
There are traces of... of goodness
and regret within him.

50:34.958 --> 50:37.832
That's what makes him such
a great tragic hero.

50:37.916 --> 50:42.332
The whole play is about his... his inner
struggle between good and evil.

50:42.416 --> 50:44.290
Right and wrong.

50:47.291 --> 50:48.957
You have hidden depths, William.

50:50.791 --> 50:52.790
Women like that in a man.

50:57.875 --> 50:59.874
- May I see you tonight?
- Uh, um...

50:59.958 --> 51:03.415
l-I don't think that's a good idea.

51:03.500 --> 51:06.915
I-I've got costume fittings tomorrow.

51:11.583 --> 51:13.915
This is ground-breaking work, sir.

51:15.958 --> 51:18.790
Now the King will be in residence
at Holyrood in just three weeks.

51:18.875 --> 51:20.790
Will this work be completed in time?

51:20.875 --> 51:24.999
Aye, I shall have to step up the pace,
but I don't foresee any major problems.

51:25.083 --> 51:27.249
Sir Astley-Cooper acquired
his knighthood

51:27.333 --> 51:30.624
by having successfully lanced
a boil on the King's head.

51:30.708 --> 51:33.582
I can only begin to imagine the level
of patronage

51:33.666 --> 51:37.082
His Majesty will confer on you
having seen these, uh...

51:37.166 --> 51:42.540
Oh, I'm, um... I'm calling them
"photographs," sir.

51:42.625 --> 51:44.999
Photographs.

51:45.083 --> 51:48.165
Excellent.

51:48.250 --> 51:50.207
My Lord.

51:50.291 --> 51:51.582
Gentlemen.

51:58.375 --> 52:01.832
Any difficulties acquiring subjects,
Doctor?

52:01.916 --> 52:05.957
I'll admit the anatomical bylaw
was a temporary inconvenience.

52:06.041 --> 52:09.249
But not even you, Monro,
can stand in the way of progress.

52:09.333 --> 52:11.415
Good day, gentlemen.

52:18.416 --> 52:21.374
You know, you got a good business
going there, Willy.

52:21.458 --> 52:22.707
I know.

52:22.791 --> 52:25.999
But the problem is...
product acquisition.

52:26.083 --> 52:27.124
What?

52:27.791 --> 52:30.624
You know, killing people.
That's how you acquire your product.

52:30.708 --> 52:32.207
It's not efficient.

52:32.291 --> 52:34.332
It's bloody hard work,
that's what it is.

52:34.416 --> 52:36.040
People are starting to notice,
you know.

52:36.125 --> 52:39.415
There's all kinds of crazy rumours
flying around the West Port.

52:39.500 --> 52:43.415
Keep going, Willy.
Helps me think.

52:45.500 --> 52:48.707
The thing is that nobody likes
dealing with dead bodies.

52:48.791 --> 52:52.165
So, for a fee, you could
take them off their hands.

52:52.250 --> 52:55.207
Sell them a coffin for their loved ones,
arrange a burial.

52:55.375 --> 52:58.624
Yeah, and when people are grieving they
don't think about how much things cost.

52:58.708 --> 52:59.999
We could call it a "funeral store."

53:02.625 --> 53:06.082
Funeral store, no.

53:06.166 --> 53:08.124
Sounds too down-market.

53:08.208 --> 53:11.415
I'd prefer something like
"funeral parlour."

53:11.500 --> 53:15.040
Oh God, yes!
Yeah, that's a fantastic idea!

53:15.125 --> 53:19.374
Oh, don't stop! Don't stop, Willy!
I'm almost there.

53:33.333 --> 53:34.915
Ah, Mr. Hare.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.624
Doctor Knox would like the pleasure
of your company.

53:37.708 --> 53:41.832
As from now,
I shall require two bodies a week.

53:43.250 --> 53:45.624
Fresh ones, mind you,
in good condition.

53:45.708 --> 53:48.540
That won't be easy, Doctor.

53:48.625 --> 53:52.374
Mr. Hare I've never asked you
how you came by these subjects.

53:52.458 --> 53:55.290
Oh, my partner
and I have arrangements

53:55.375 --> 53:57.749
with the low lodging houses
in the West Port.

53:57.833 --> 54:01.915
- Whenever someone dies...
- Mr. Hare, I'm a doctor.

54:02.000 --> 54:06.665
I know the difference between death
by natural and unnatural causes.

54:06.750 --> 54:10.665
Edinburgh's a very dangerous place,
Doctor Knox.

54:10.750 --> 54:15.665
And something tells me that recently,
it's become a lot more dangerous.

54:17.000 --> 54:20.999
I don't presume to judge, Mr. Hare.

54:21.083 --> 54:27.582
But I know that as a result
of my work and the doctors I train,

54:27.666 --> 54:32.207
thousands, perhaps millions of lives
will be saved.

54:33.750 --> 54:37.832
Two a week, Mr. Hare.
Can you manage that?

54:40.958 --> 54:42.415
At your service, sir.

54:45.791 --> 54:47.082
What more could a man ask for?

54:47.166 --> 54:49.790
Mighty fine place you have here,
gentlemen.

54:49.875 --> 54:51.624
How much will you be asking?

54:53.541 --> 54:55.624
Nothing.

55:05.583 --> 55:07.540
Willy, do something!

55:16.458 --> 55:18.915
Unhand my boys!

55:21.000 --> 55:22.332
Gentlemen...

55:22.416 --> 55:25.957
we live, thank God,
in enlightened times.

55:26.041 --> 55:29.499
The watchword of our age
is "progress."

55:29.583 --> 55:32.332
Progress in the arts.

55:37.833 --> 55:41.332
Progress in science.
Progress in technology.

55:43.208 --> 55:45.124
Progress in transportation.

55:54.916 --> 55:57.207
Progress in society.

55:57.291 --> 55:58.415
Please help me.

55:58.500 --> 56:00.790
Fox, get your sketchbook.

56:00.875 --> 56:03.082
In all these fields,

56:03.166 --> 56:06.624
we've moved further and faster
in the last two decades

56:06.708 --> 56:09.082
than in the previous two centuries.

56:09.166 --> 56:12.040
Never before have ordinary people

56:12.125 --> 56:16.249
had so much freedom
and opportunity.

56:16.333 --> 56:22.540
The year is 1828,
and we are building a new world.

56:24.625 --> 56:27.832
A new and better world.

56:33.291 --> 56:35.374
Sergeant, keep them quiet!

56:35.458 --> 56:37.999
Quiet, please!

56:38.083 --> 56:42.457
As men of science,
it is our role... nae!

56:42.541 --> 56:49.040
Our duty to be in the vanguard
of that movement.

56:49.125 --> 56:52.499
This is not the time for rest.

56:52.583 --> 56:55.207
It is not a time for half measures.

56:55.291 --> 57:00.040
This is not the time
to sit on our achievements.

57:00.125 --> 57:05.624
It is the time to work harder...

57:05.708 --> 57:08.957
and faster than ever before.

57:10.416 --> 57:14.249
Gentlemen, I give you...

57:14.333 --> 57:16.582
a multiple dissection!

57:34.750 --> 57:38.582
You don't think I look a little bit
too masculine?

57:38.666 --> 57:41.874
- You know, too much like a man?
- I think you look lovely.

57:41.958 --> 57:44.040
I'll see you on Friday?

58:04.416 --> 58:07.999
Excellent work, Fox.
Now we'll go and do the New Town.

58:14.750 --> 58:15.915
Willy.

58:20.958 --> 58:23.582
The militia have posters up
all over the streets.

58:23.666 --> 58:26.040
- Of us?
- No!

58:26.125 --> 58:29.665
Of the people we've...
you know...

58:32.166 --> 58:34.124
They're closing in, William.

58:34.208 --> 58:37.332
Then it's our good fortune
that we're not doing it anymore.

58:37.416 --> 58:38.915
I've been doing the sums, Willy.

58:39.000 --> 58:42.957
I have got enough money put aside
to start our new business.

58:43.041 --> 58:47.290
- What new business?
- Funeral parlours.

58:47.375 --> 58:48.707
Funeral parlours?

58:48.791 --> 58:51.749
It's a place where people
bring bodies to be buried.

58:51.833 --> 58:54.457
- And we wouldn't have to kill 'em?
- They're already dead!

58:56.750 --> 58:58.957
Thank you. I like it.

58:59.041 --> 59:02.374
I knew you would.
We're going straight to the top, Willy.

59:02.458 --> 59:05.582
And nobody...
nobody is gonna stop us.

59:27.791 --> 59:29.999
All right... Shh! Everyone.

59:31.833 --> 59:34.582
I'd like to propose a toast.

59:34.666 --> 59:38.790
To the man whose hard work
and whose commitment

59:38.875 --> 59:40.415
made this possible.

59:40.500 --> 59:41.832
To William Burke.

59:41.916 --> 59:44.124
To William Burke!

59:44.208 --> 59:47.082
- William Burke.
- No, come on, now.

59:50.166 --> 59:52.915
- You embarrassed me.
- I know.

59:57.458 --> 59:59.207
That's me!

59:59.291 --> 01:00:02.957
Oh, Willy,
I don't know how to thank you.

01:00:03.041 --> 01:00:04.957
I can think of a few ways.

01:00:10.916 --> 01:00:12.707
Come to buy a ticket, Danny?

01:00:12.791 --> 01:00:16.457
Blood and guts aren't entertainment
for me, William.

01:00:16.541 --> 01:00:19.457
They're business.
Now get in.

01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:30.249
I've decided to bring you
and Mr. Burke into the firm.

01:00:30.333 --> 01:00:31.415
Sorry?

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:34.624
You'll have regular employment.
A steady wage.

01:00:34.708 --> 01:00:36.374
We'll be partners.

01:00:36.458 --> 01:00:39.915
Partners, is it?

01:00:42.041 --> 01:00:46.040
But Willy and I are out of the
body-snatching business now.

01:00:46.125 --> 01:00:48.832
Mm. So you say.

01:00:48.916 --> 01:00:52.374
- Do I have a choice, Danny?
- Of course you do, William.

01:00:52.458 --> 01:00:55.749
Free will is what distinguishes man
from beast.

01:01:07.916 --> 01:01:10.124
Our final subject.

01:01:17.291 --> 01:01:18.790
Isn't that Danny McTavish?

01:01:21.375 --> 01:01:23.957
Danny McTavish has been dissected
by Doctor Knox.

01:01:30.458 --> 01:01:35.165
I am Captain McLintoch,
and this is the Edinburgh Militia.

01:01:36.208 --> 01:01:39.665
Your reputation precedes you,
Captain McLintoch.

01:01:41.083 --> 01:01:42.499
Thank you, sir.

01:01:42.583 --> 01:01:47.124
Your preposterous war on grave robbery
was a model of incompetence.

01:01:47.208 --> 01:01:50.499
It has come to my attention, sir,
that earlier on today,

01:01:50.583 --> 01:01:52.957
you publicly dissected a corpse.

01:01:53.041 --> 01:01:56.874
Well, if this is him
then your information is correct.

01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:02.749
Pull yourself together, Private.

01:02:04.791 --> 01:02:06.457
How did you obtain this body?

01:02:06.541 --> 01:02:08.499
Patterson?

01:02:08.583 --> 01:02:10.457
I believe it was dumped
in the alley behind this building.

01:02:10.541 --> 01:02:11.957
Some students found him.

01:02:12.041 --> 01:02:15.374
This is a notorious villain.
Danny McTavish.

01:02:15.458 --> 01:02:18.040
Ah, at least his demise
might not be in vain.

01:02:18.125 --> 01:02:22.915
Saint Peter might look kindly on his
services to the teaching of medicine.

01:02:27.916 --> 01:02:29.957
Fox, show me your hand.

01:02:35.208 --> 01:02:39.290
A defensive wound,
clear evidence of foul play.

01:02:39.375 --> 01:02:42.874
And you, sir, have been tampering
with the evidence.

01:02:42.958 --> 01:02:46.957
That's an outrageous accusation,
Captain McLintoch.

01:02:47.041 --> 01:02:50.499
I shall be reporting this matter
to the Solicitor-General.

01:02:50.583 --> 01:02:53.249
Lord Harrington
will back my judgment on this.

01:02:53.333 --> 01:02:55.207
I stake my job on it.

01:02:55.291 --> 01:02:57.624
You just did.

01:03:11.416 --> 01:03:13.374
Er, Ginny?

01:03:13.458 --> 01:03:15.832
How many people are out there?

01:03:15.916 --> 01:03:17.957
Standing room only.

01:03:20.458 --> 01:03:22.249
Thank you.

01:03:24.250 --> 01:03:29.290
When shall we three
meet again?

01:03:29.375 --> 01:03:34.499
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?

01:03:34.583 --> 01:03:36.957
When the hurly-burly's done.

01:03:37.041 --> 01:03:39.999
When the battle's lost and won.

01:03:40.083 --> 01:03:43.874
That will be ere the set of the sun.

01:03:43.958 --> 01:03:46.749
Where the place?

01:03:46.833 --> 01:03:48.707
Upon the heath.

01:03:48.791 --> 01:03:53.040
There to meet with... Macbeth.

01:04:07.041 --> 01:04:09.957
If I stand here, I saw him!

01:04:10.041 --> 01:04:11.457
Fie, for shame!

01:04:11.541 --> 01:04:16.165
Blood hath been shed here now,
in the olden time.

01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:21.499
Ere humane statute
purged the gentle weal...

01:04:21.583 --> 01:04:26.124
Ay, and since, too,
murders have been committed.

01:04:26.208 --> 01:04:28.582
Too terrible for the ear!

01:04:28.666 --> 01:04:32.749
There was a time that,
when the brains were out,

01:04:32.833 --> 01:04:36.915
the man would die,
and there an end.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.832
But now he rise again!

01:04:42.416 --> 01:04:46.499
With twenty mortal murders
on their crown!

01:04:46.583 --> 01:04:50.165
And push us from our stools!

01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:52.832
This is more strange.

01:04:52.916 --> 01:04:55.832
Than such a murder is.

01:04:55.916 --> 01:04:58.874
All our missing persons are here.

01:04:58.958 --> 01:05:00.665
Qu'est ce que vous faites ici?

01:05:00.958 --> 01:05:03.707
Who did all this?!

01:05:03.791 --> 01:05:05.707
C'est moi.

01:05:20.375 --> 01:05:22.249
Bravo!

01:05:38.666 --> 01:05:40.207
Ginny?

01:05:40.291 --> 01:05:41.790
I think they liked it.

01:05:41.875 --> 01:05:43.290
Five curtain calls
and a standing ovation.

01:05:43.375 --> 01:05:44.832
I'd say it's a smash hit.

01:05:44.916 --> 01:05:46.999
This is the happiest day of my life.

01:05:47.083 --> 01:05:50.499
What's wrong, Willy?
You don't seem happy.

01:05:50.583 --> 01:05:53.915
I'm happy for you, Gin.
I...

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.249
I just can't help thinking now this
is over,

01:05:56.333 --> 01:05:57.874
you don't really need me any more.

01:05:57.958 --> 01:06:01.290
You're right.
I don't need you.

01:06:02.958 --> 01:06:04.707
But I do want you.

01:06:04.875 --> 01:06:06.499
Really?

01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:12.415
Mm! Oh!
We should take the play to London.

01:06:13.375 --> 01:06:15.915
Make it a musical.
I'm blessed with the voice of an angel.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.040
Aye, they could do with something new
in the West End.

01:06:18.125 --> 01:06:21.957
Besides Edinburgh's changed.
You know, people have changed.

01:06:22.041 --> 01:06:24.582
- I've changed.
- Me, too.

01:06:26.541 --> 01:06:29.582
- Oh, I want us to be together, Willy.
- Tonight?

01:06:29.666 --> 01:06:32.082
Tomorrow. Tonight I'm the star.
I must shine.

01:06:32.166 --> 01:06:34.290
Oh, there's Mary. Mary!

01:06:34.375 --> 01:06:38.457
Oh, Ginny!
They absolutely loved us!

01:06:44.875 --> 01:06:49.707
These are not bad, but as you can see,
the heliograph is the future.

01:06:49.791 --> 01:06:51.540
Did you kill these people?!

01:06:51.625 --> 01:06:54.915
Certainly not!
They were all already...

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.790
How you say?
Chopped into pieces.

01:06:57.875 --> 01:07:00.374
You disgusting little French fop!

01:07:00.458 --> 01:07:02.332
I was just doing what I was told.

01:07:02.416 --> 01:07:06.374
What you were told?
Told by whom?!

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.457
How do I look, Patterson?

01:07:11.541 --> 01:07:14.332
Like someone who's about to go
down in history, sir.

01:07:18.833 --> 01:07:20.665
Yes?

01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:25.749
We have questions on urgent
militia matters for Doctor Knox.

01:07:25.833 --> 01:07:26.915
He's not here.

01:07:30.416 --> 01:07:32.082
Ow...

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.624
Well, I'd appreciate if you could
tell us where we can find him.

01:07:38.708 --> 01:07:41.624
He's making an official presentation
at Holyrood Palace.

01:07:46.208 --> 01:07:49.707
Sharpen up, men.
We're going to pay the King a visit.

01:07:54.708 --> 01:07:55.832
Morning, Willy.

01:07:59.583 --> 01:08:02.707
For the love of Lord Jesus,
she finally gave it up.

01:08:02.791 --> 01:08:05.874
No! No.

01:08:05.958 --> 01:08:08.207
Although I'm pretty sure
tonight's the night.

01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:13.457
I know this amazing trick
you can do with your tongue.

01:08:13.541 --> 01:08:14.915
Thank you, William!

01:08:20.750 --> 01:08:22.749
Well,
that could have been worse.

01:08:22.832 --> 01:08:25.207
Do you mean
if he'd fallen asleep earlier?

01:08:25.291 --> 01:08:27.999
Excuse me, what would you
like us to do with these, sir?

01:08:28.082 --> 01:08:30.874
I don't care.
Just get rid of them.

01:08:30.957 --> 01:08:33.415
Doctor Robert Knox!

01:08:36.166 --> 01:08:39.457
The King is looking forward
to seeing your map of the human body.

01:08:39.541 --> 01:08:40.707
Excellent.

01:08:40.791 --> 01:08:42.999
My advice is to keep
the presentation short.

01:08:43.082 --> 01:08:45.207
And don't ask him to read too much.

01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:49.415
His Majesty can just, er,
look at the pictures.

01:08:52.166 --> 01:08:54.957
Doctor Robert Knox!

01:08:55.041 --> 01:08:56.665
Stop right there!

01:09:00.707 --> 01:09:05.665
I demand you hand over these photographs
in the name of the Solicitor-General.

01:09:05.750 --> 01:09:09.957
May I remind you, Captain,
that I am the Solicitor-General.

01:09:11.541 --> 01:09:13.749
What exactly do you think
you're doing here?

01:09:13.832 --> 01:09:15.624
Solving a crime, sir.

01:09:19.625 --> 01:09:21.207
What on earth
are you talking about?

01:09:21.291 --> 01:09:22.749
I'm talking about murder, sir.

01:09:22.832 --> 01:09:25.874
That volume contains evidence
of foul play.

01:09:25.957 --> 01:09:28.874
I don't know what this absurd
little man is trying to prove,

01:09:28.957 --> 01:09:31.124
but he's making a mockery
of our profession.

01:09:31.207 --> 01:09:32.374
I want him removed.

01:09:32.457 --> 01:09:36.582
It is you, sir who is making a mockery
of the medical profession.

01:09:36.666 --> 01:09:42.749
And if there is one single shred
of truth in this man's allegations,

01:09:42.832 --> 01:09:45.790
we shall all have to pay the price.

01:09:48.291 --> 01:09:50.999
His Majesty
has asked to see my work.

01:09:51.082 --> 01:09:54.749
I intend to fulfill his wish.

01:09:54.833 --> 01:09:56.124
Good day.

01:09:57.125 --> 01:10:00.249
Either you hand over the evidence,
Doctor Knox,

01:10:00.333 --> 01:10:02.665
or I'll be forced to arrest you!

01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:05.165
You're not touching it.

01:10:35.541 --> 01:10:39.999
How many cadavers were used
to create the portfolio?

01:10:42.083 --> 01:10:44.290
- 16.
- 16?!

01:10:44.375 --> 01:10:47.540
And who provided
the 16 cadavers?!

01:11:22.958 --> 01:11:25.332
Edinburgh Militia!
Nobody moves!

01:11:25.416 --> 01:11:28.790
Oh,
for the love of Lord Jesus!

01:11:28.875 --> 01:11:30.124
I beg your pardon.

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:40.374
Mr. And Mrs. Hare.

01:11:40.458 --> 01:11:45.665
I'm arresting you both on suspicion
of murder in the first degree!

01:11:51.250 --> 01:11:53.290
We did terrible things, William.

01:11:53.375 --> 01:11:55.915
A man has a right
to scratch out a living.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.874
Nobody's gonna blame us for that.

01:11:57.958 --> 01:12:00.665
Ginny can.

01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:03.374
Ah.

01:12:03.458 --> 01:12:06.832
She's gonna find out, isn't she?
She'll know everything.

01:12:08.875 --> 01:12:11.749
I won't lie to you, Willy,
it is a possibility.

01:12:22.166 --> 01:12:23.415
This is unbelievable.

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:28.624
"Macbeth accused of murder."

01:12:28.708 --> 01:12:30.790
You really have no idea, do you?

01:12:32.166 --> 01:12:36.624
Captain,
you've no right to keep us here.

01:12:36.708 --> 01:12:39.499
I have every right.
Will you please sit down?

01:12:41.875 --> 01:12:44.915
Now, Mrs. Hare, I have
some questions I'd like to ask you.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.249
I'm not saying anything,
especially not to a Presbyterian.

01:12:49.333 --> 01:12:50.582
I'm half Jewish.

01:12:50.666 --> 01:12:54.082
I'm being persecuted
by a heathen!

01:12:54.166 --> 01:12:55.790
This is an outrage.

01:12:55.875 --> 01:12:58.624
I demand to speak to the...
Solicitor-General!

01:12:58.708 --> 01:13:01.207
- I demand to be released immediately.
- Immediately!

01:13:01.291 --> 01:13:04.374
I demand to speak to a Catholic.

01:13:04.458 --> 01:13:06.124
Miss Hawkins and Mrs. Hare,

01:13:06.208 --> 01:13:09.290
either you keep quiet,
or I'll have you both shot!

01:13:13.625 --> 01:13:17.207
"Wee Captain Tam McLintoch
of the Edinburgh Militia

01:13:17.291 --> 01:13:22.165
"has apprehended the perpetrators
of the notorious West Port murders.

01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:27.957
"The list of victims include
Mrs. Mary O'Toole of the New Town...

01:13:28.041 --> 01:13:30.624
"Daft Jamie of the West Port...

01:13:30.708 --> 01:13:34.582
"the freed slave
John Martin of London...

01:13:34.666 --> 01:13:37.999
Mrs. Susanna McCorkindale
of Aberdeen!"

01:13:38.083 --> 01:13:39.957
In the name of the law!

01:13:41.833 --> 01:13:44.832
I demand you disperse immediately!

01:13:44.916 --> 01:13:47.290
Let's get the bastards! Come on!

01:13:55.583 --> 01:13:57.207
Stand fast, men.

01:14:06.541 --> 01:14:08.874
Kill the bastards!

01:14:22.625 --> 01:14:25.249
I can't live
with this on my conscience.

01:14:25.333 --> 01:14:27.540
All right?

01:14:27.625 --> 01:14:29.040
I've got to confess.

01:14:32.083 --> 01:14:34.332
The minute we're outta here,
we'll find you a priest.

01:14:34.416 --> 01:14:37.957
There's no way I will ever be redeemed
in the eyes of the Lord Almighty.

01:14:38.083 --> 01:14:40.749
I've gotta confess to the proper
authorities here on earth.

01:14:40.833 --> 01:14:44.749
That's not such a, a good idea,
Willy.

01:14:46.125 --> 01:14:48.874
'Cause you'd be putting a noose
around your own neck.

01:14:48.958 --> 01:14:52.624
It's no more than I deserve.

01:14:54.833 --> 01:14:57.415
Not to mention putting a noose
around my neck.

01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:01.915
And Lucky's.

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:07.874
And Ginny's.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.207
Let me handle this.

01:15:15.291 --> 01:15:19.082
Ahh, pleasure to see you again,
Captain.

01:15:19.166 --> 01:15:20.957
All right.

01:15:21.041 --> 01:15:23.165
Can you tell us
what we're supposed to have done?

01:15:23.250 --> 01:15:26.999
Sixteen counts
of first-degree murder.

01:15:27.083 --> 01:15:31.499
That does sound serious.
And do you have any of the bodies?

01:15:31.583 --> 01:15:33.915
Do you have any eyewitnesses?

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.582
In fact, do you have
a single shred of evidence?

01:15:39.541 --> 01:15:41.290
It's all in there, laddie.

01:15:56.833 --> 01:15:59.290
Captain,
a message from Lord Harrington, sir.

01:15:59.375 --> 01:16:02.165
He wants to see you, sir,
at your earliest convenience.

01:16:02.250 --> 01:16:06.624
His Lordship also said to bring
Doctor Knox's portfolio with you.

01:16:18.333 --> 01:16:19.665
Captain.

01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:20.915
Take a seat.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.165
Oh, thank you, my Lord.

01:16:23.958 --> 01:16:27.040
- Chocolate?
- Uh, thank you, my Lord.

01:16:27.125 --> 01:16:29.915
The Lord Provost and I are very
interested to know

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.832
how we're doing on this case.

01:16:31.916 --> 01:16:37.874
Well, at present, I have Mr. Burke
and Mr. Hare under lock and key.

01:16:37.958 --> 01:16:40.124
They're not admitting anything,
but I'm sure by the time

01:16:40.208 --> 01:16:43.457
I have finished with them,
they will crack, I'm sure of that.

01:16:43.541 --> 01:16:47.374
But is that really what we want,
Captain?

01:16:47.458 --> 01:16:48.749
Excuse me, sir?

01:16:48.833 --> 01:16:51.915
This city is renowned
for its medical facilities.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.624
Students come from all over the world
to train in our anatomy schools.

01:16:56.708 --> 01:16:59.749
They bring a great deal of money
with them.

01:16:59.833 --> 01:17:04.790
We're rightfully proud of our status
and of our traditions.

01:17:04.875 --> 01:17:06.582
It would be a pity to sully them

01:17:06.666 --> 01:17:09.749
with a scandal such
as a high-profile murder trial.

01:17:09.833 --> 01:17:13.374
Especially a murder trial
that might compromise

01:17:13.458 --> 01:17:16.582
the reputations of our esteemed
teaching hospitals.

01:17:16.666 --> 01:17:21.207
You're surely not suggesting
that I let these two men go free?

01:17:21.291 --> 01:17:26.082
No, no, we need someone to swing
for these crimes, but no trial.

01:17:26.166 --> 01:17:28.082
The city will gladly show its gratitude

01:17:28.166 --> 01:17:30.207
for your delicate handling
of this affair.

01:17:30.291 --> 01:17:32.749
In fact, in a city of this standing,

01:17:32.833 --> 01:17:37.374
surely the militia
should be commanded by a-a Major.

01:17:37.458 --> 01:17:40.374
Or even a Colonel. Hmm?

01:17:41.958 --> 01:17:42.999
Indeed.

01:17:43.083 --> 01:17:47.540
Rest assured, my Lord, my Lords,
that the city can rely on me.

01:17:47.625 --> 01:17:49.124
That's settled, then.

01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:54.957
We'll look after that, Colonel.

01:17:57.375 --> 01:17:59.915
Thank you, my lord.
My lord.

01:18:24.125 --> 01:18:25.999
So let me get this straight,
Captain.

01:18:26.083 --> 01:18:27.165
Colonel.

01:18:29.250 --> 01:18:30.290
Colonel?

01:18:32.250 --> 01:18:37.499
If one of us confesses
to having committed these crimes

01:18:37.583 --> 01:18:39.207
the others will walk free?

01:18:39.291 --> 01:18:40.374
Precisely.

01:18:40.458 --> 01:18:43.874
But that is outrageous!
We're all innocent!

01:18:43.958 --> 01:18:46.249
Nobody's gonna confess to a crime
they didn't commit

01:18:46.333 --> 01:18:48.540
just to make you popular
with the mob out there!

01:18:48.625 --> 01:18:49.999
It's all right, William!

01:18:50.083 --> 01:18:52.790
This is the chance for one of us
to do the decent thing.

01:18:52.875 --> 01:18:55.790
You call that decent?

01:18:55.875 --> 01:18:58.749
What kind of man
would do such a thing?

01:19:01.041 --> 01:19:02.832
I will.

01:19:07.458 --> 01:19:09.707
Thank you, God.

01:19:09.791 --> 01:19:11.999
On one condition.

01:19:30.166 --> 01:19:31.332
I know what you did.

01:19:31.416 --> 01:19:33.957
I am so sorry, Ginny.

01:19:35.833 --> 01:19:39.832
I-I don't expect you to forgive me.

01:19:39.916 --> 01:19:42.207
It's just so romantic.

01:19:43.333 --> 01:19:47.540
Confessing to save the life
of your lover.

01:19:49.291 --> 01:19:50.874
It's like Shakespeare.

01:19:55.041 --> 01:20:01.040
For never was there a story of...
of such woe,

01:20:01.125 --> 01:20:03.207
as of Ginny and her Romeo.

01:21:16.166 --> 01:21:18.290
William Burke of the West Port,

01:21:18.375 --> 01:21:21.249
formerly of County Donegal
in Ireland...

01:21:21.333 --> 01:21:22.415
Irish scum!

01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:26.665
You are convicted of the heinous crimes
of grave robbery and multiple murder.

01:21:32.208 --> 01:21:34.915
Do you have anything to say
before you are consigned to hell?

01:21:38.833 --> 01:21:41.165
Only this.

01:21:45.250 --> 01:21:46.957
I did it for love.

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:19.749
I know he seemed like
a nice guy and all that.

01:22:25.166 --> 01:22:27.207
And I suppose
you have to respect the fact

01:22:27.291 --> 01:22:29.374
that he made the ultimate sacrifice
for love.

01:22:33.458 --> 01:22:36.332
But he did kill all those people
just for money.

01:22:36.416 --> 01:22:38.124
And that's just evil.

01:22:40.208 --> 01:22:41.415
Thank you.

01:22:45.333 --> 01:22:47.082
As for the rest of them...

01:22:49.583 --> 01:22:51.915
The Doctor ended up
in the New World.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.290
After all,
anything goes over there.

01:23:00.750 --> 01:23:03.290
Rat catcher!
Rat catcher!

01:23:03.375 --> 01:23:05.790
Fergus took protection to a new level

01:23:05.875 --> 01:23:07.957
and made a fortune
selling life insurance.

01:23:10.208 --> 01:23:15.040
As for our French friend here,
he also became a minor celebrity.

01:23:15.125 --> 01:23:18.249
He returned to Paris
and continued his work.

01:23:20.125 --> 01:23:21.457
Allez, allez, allez.
Vite, vite, vite.

01:23:21.541 --> 01:23:22.582
Ah, come here.

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:26.499
I can't live without you.
You're beautiful.

01:23:26.583 --> 01:23:28.249
Ah, arrêt! Arrêt!

01:23:28.333 --> 01:23:31.082
Say "cheese"!

01:23:31.166 --> 01:23:33.207
Fromage!

01:23:33.291 --> 01:23:37.415
Nicephore is widely credited as one
of the inventors of photography.

01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:39.457
Parfait. Bravo.

01:23:40.625 --> 01:23:44.707
Lord Harrington, having weathered
the storm of the West Port murders

01:23:44.791 --> 01:23:48.999
was later forced to resign
after Colonel wee Tam McLintoch's

01:23:49.083 --> 01:23:52.915
racy private memoirs
were a publishing sensation.

01:23:53.958 --> 01:23:55.582
But the real star turned out to be

01:23:55.666 --> 01:23:59.540
Professor Monro's young assistant,
Charles Darwin.

01:23:59.625 --> 01:24:04.415
He went on to write a book that sold
almost as well as the Bible.

01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:08.040
It said only the fittest survive.

01:24:08.125 --> 01:24:10.707
And living proof of that
is young Ginny.

01:24:10.791 --> 01:24:15.082
She finally overcame her grief
and became a popular actress.

01:24:15.166 --> 01:24:17.457
She's terrible!

01:24:17.541 --> 01:24:18.957
Get her off!

01:24:19.041 --> 01:24:20.499
Well, not that popular.

01:24:20.583 --> 01:24:24.665
As for our two heroes,
William Hare followed his dream.

01:24:32.791 --> 01:24:35.832
In the end,
only Hare got the Royal Seal.

01:24:37.958 --> 01:24:41.624
And William Burke ended up
in the same place as his victims.

01:24:41.708 --> 01:24:43.499
Where shall I start?

01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:48.040
I think the feet.

01:24:51.291 --> 01:24:52.874
When I wake up

01:24:52.958 --> 01:24:54.624
Well, I know I'm gonna be

01:24:54.708 --> 01:24:58.249
I'm gonna be the man
who wakes up next to you

01:24:58.333 --> 01:25:00.040
When I go out

01:25:00.125 --> 01:25:01.832
Yeah, I know I'm gonna be

01:25:01.916 --> 01:25:04.832
I'm gonna be the man
who goes along with you

01:25:05.875 --> 01:25:07.582
If I get drunk

01:25:07.666 --> 01:25:09.165
Well, I know I'm gonna be

01:25:09.250 --> 01:25:12.582
I'm gonna be the man
who gets drunk next to you

01:25:12.666 --> 01:25:14.540
And if I haver

01:25:14.625 --> 01:25:16.582
Yeah, I know I'm gonna be

01:25:16.666 --> 01:25:19.915
I'm gonna be the man
who's havering to you

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.582
But I would walk 500 miles

01:25:23.666 --> 01:25:27.582
And I would walk 500 more

01:25:27.666 --> 01:25:31.999
Just to be the man
who walked 1,000 miles

01:25:32.083 --> 01:25:34.749
To fall down at your door

01:25:34.833 --> 01:25:36.332
When I'm working

01:25:36.416 --> 01:25:38.290
Yes, I know I'm gonna be

01:25:38.375 --> 01:25:41.832
I'm gonna be the man
who's working hard for you

01:25:41.916 --> 01:25:43.749
And when the money

01:25:43.833 --> 01:25:45.499
Comes in for the work I do

01:25:45.583 --> 01:25:48.915
I'll pass almost every penny
on to you

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.249
When I come home
When I come home

01:25:51.333 --> 01:25:52.832
Yeah, I know I'm gonna be

01:25:52.916 --> 01:25:56.207
I'm gonna be the man
who comes back home to you

01:25:56.291 --> 01:25:58.124
And if I grow old

01:25:58.208 --> 01:26:00.082
Well, I know I'm gonna be

01:26:00.166 --> 01:26:03.707
I'm gonna be the man
who's growing old with you

01:26:03.791 --> 01:26:07.540
But I would walk 500 miles

01:26:07.625 --> 01:26:11.249
And I would walk 500 more

01:26:11.333 --> 01:26:15.749
Just to be the man
who walks 1,000 miles

01:26:15.833 --> 01:26:18.582
To fall down at your door

01:26:36.583 --> 01:26:37.999
When I'm lonely

01:26:38.083 --> 01:26:40.040
Well, I know I'm gonna be

01:26:40.125 --> 01:26:43.790
I'm gonna be the man
who's lonely without you

01:26:43.875 --> 01:26:45.665
When I'm dreaming

01:26:45.750 --> 01:26:47.332
Well,
I know I'm gonna dream

01:26:47.416 --> 01:26:51.124
I'm gonna dream about the time
when I'm with you

01:26:51.208 --> 01:26:53.040
When I go out
When I go out

01:26:53.125 --> 01:26:54.624
Well, I know I'm gonna be

01:26:54.708 --> 01:26:58.290
I'm gonna be the man
who goes along with you

01:26:58.375 --> 01:27:00.332
And when I come home
When I come home

01:27:00.416 --> 01:27:01.957
Yes, I know I'm gonna be

01:27:02.041 --> 01:27:05.165
I'm gonna be the man
who's comes back home with you

01:27:05.250 --> 01:27:09.665
I'm gonna be the man
who's coming home with you

01:27:12.375 --> 01:27:15.707
But I would walk 500 miles

01:27:15.791 --> 01:27:19.374
And I would walk 500 more

01:27:19.458 --> 01:27:23.915
Just to be the man who walks
1,000 miles

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.707
To fall down at your door

01:27:56.083 --> 01:27:59.415
And I would walk 500 miles

01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:03.124
And I would walk 500 more

01:28:03.208 --> 01:28:07.624
Just to be the man who walked
1,000 miles

01:28:07.708 --> 01:28:12.249
To fall down at your door
