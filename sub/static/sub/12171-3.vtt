06:56.708 --> 06:57.875
and open me up

06:57.917 --> 06:59.916
and remove tissue

06:59.917 --> 07:01.333
from around my tendons.

07:01.375 --> 07:02.416
- But this one's much simpler,

07:02.417 --> 07:03.624
you're not gonna go to sleep.

07:03.625 --> 07:04.708
- Yeah, but it's supposed
- to be painful.

07:04.750 --> 07:05.791
He said it's gonna be painful.

07:05.792 --> 07:07.125
- Did he?
- Yeah.

07:07.128 --> 07:08.542
And now, it's time

07:08.543 --> 07:09.957
to get the stitches taken out.

07:09.958 --> 07:12.124
I took a...

07:12.125 --> 07:14.291
Anti-psycho.

07:14.292 --> 07:15.375
- Anti-psycho.

07:15.417 --> 07:16.542
- Anti-flip-out.

07:16.583 --> 07:17.604
- They should make

07:17.605 --> 07:18.625
your own brand for that.

07:19.625 --> 07:20.938
- Shervin was

07:20.939 --> 07:22.250
in the hospital with me

07:22.292 --> 07:23.917
when I got my surgery.

07:23.958 --> 07:25.708
- He was there
- before I went under,

07:25.750 --> 07:26.958
he was there when I woke up.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.457
If I die, I want a party

07:29.458 --> 07:31.917
with macaroni and cheese.

07:31.958 --> 07:33.750
- This is the place, huh?
- This is it.

07:33.792 --> 07:35.458
Normally, mj would be with me

07:35.500 --> 07:37.250
but she has a new boo

07:37.292 --> 07:38.459
and doesn't have time

07:38.460 --> 07:39.624
for her girl,

07:39.625 --> 07:41.375
so I'm going with sherv.

07:42.958 --> 07:44.125
- After you.
- Oh, hey you guys.

07:44.128 --> 07:45.292
- My name's Paul.
- Shervin.

07:45.333 --> 07:46.500
- Shervin.
- Nice to meet you.

07:46.503 --> 07:47.833
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi, golnesa.

07:47.836 --> 07:48.958
- Golnesa.
- Yes.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.167
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.167
- [Inaudible]
- This'll be a piece of cake.

07:52.208 --> 07:54.000
- How does this affect your
- normal, everyday activities?

07:54.003 --> 07:55.417
- She doesn't have
- a lot of activities.

07:55.458 --> 07:56.499
- I grab a drink

07:56.500 --> 07:58.167
and I can drink with one hand.

07:58.208 --> 07:59.292
- Okay.

07:59.333 --> 08:00.666
So, shall we?

08:00.667 --> 08:02.499
- Oh no.

08:02.500 --> 08:05.666
Okay, hold on.

08:05.667 --> 08:07.542
- Little tug here.

08:07.543 --> 08:09.417
- F... f... f... f... f... f...

08:09.458 --> 08:10.833
- Okay, he got it.
- Please get it.

08:10.834 --> 08:11.834
Oh,

08:11.875 --> 08:14.666
sweet f... ing mother of god.

08:14.667 --> 08:16.000
- Alright.
- Ow.

08:16.003 --> 08:17.084
- It's coming out,

08:17.085 --> 08:18.167
yeah, that's a good one.

08:18.208 --> 08:19.332
Alright.

08:19.333 --> 08:20.833
- It feels like my vagina's

08:20.875 --> 08:22.271
being pulled

08:22.272 --> 08:23.666
through my mouth and out.

08:23.667 --> 08:25.083
- Totally different area.
- Yeah.

08:25.125 --> 08:26.833
- Alright, we're almost there.
- Okay, okay,

08:26.836 --> 08:28.208
- just f... ing do it,
- just f... ing do it.

08:28.211 --> 08:30.000
- Okay, okay, he's gonna do it,
- he's gonna do it.

08:30.042 --> 08:31.208
- F... f... f...
- Alright, okay,

08:31.250 --> 08:33.458
okay, don't move.

08:33.500 --> 08:34.667
- My ass is sweating.
- Alright, take a break,

08:34.708 --> 08:35.833
- take a break.
- My vagina,

08:35.875 --> 08:37.000
- everything's just sweating
- right now.

08:37.042 --> 08:38.542
- Take a, take a break.
- I just need to kind

08:38.545 --> 08:40.958
of air out a little bit.

08:42.042 --> 08:44.000
- It's hot, it's hot in here.

08:44.042 --> 08:45.417
It's a hundred.

08:45.418 --> 08:46.792
- Shervin, I'm like, really hot.

08:46.833 --> 08:48.021
- But you're doing great.

08:48.022 --> 08:49.207
- How many more do we have?

08:49.208 --> 08:50.208
- We're almost there.

08:50.209 --> 08:51.208
- Ow.

08:51.209 --> 08:53.041
- I'm sorry but here it comes.

08:53.042 --> 08:54.542
- Oh my god.
- Ta-da.

08:54.545 --> 08:55.707
- Are you serious?

08:55.708 --> 08:56.792
You did it?

08:56.833 --> 08:59.000
You did it, oh my god.

08:59.042 --> 09:00.374
- Okay, you're alright.

09:00.375 --> 09:02.374
- My pain is increasing everyday

09:02.375 --> 09:04.042
- because it's spreading
- in more and more joints

09:04.045 --> 09:05.374
right now in my body.

09:05.375 --> 09:06.792
And shervin's been

09:06.793 --> 09:08.208
really ride or die,

09:08.250 --> 09:09.917
supportive of me,

09:09.958 --> 09:11.438
more than people

09:11.439 --> 09:12.916
I've known for years.

09:12.917 --> 09:14.582
- Alright, you did good.

09:14.583 --> 09:16.083
You did good, it's over.

09:16.125 --> 09:19.167
[Music playing]

09:22.542 --> 09:23.582
- How's that? It's like,

09:23.583 --> 09:25.416
low-fat granola, any good?

09:25.417 --> 09:26.833
- A little soggy.

09:26.875 --> 09:28.417
- Well, it's been in there
- for a minute.

09:28.420 --> 09:29.749
- Mm-hmm.

09:29.750 --> 09:31.084
So, you got low-fat

09:31.085 --> 09:32.416
because you know that I'm...

09:32.417 --> 09:33.917
- No, because I...
- Still trying to recover

09:33.958 --> 09:35.250
from the eggs?

09:35.292 --> 09:36.375
A few months ago,

09:36.417 --> 09:38.375
I got my eggs frozen

09:38.417 --> 09:39.708
in the hopes that one day,

09:39.750 --> 09:41.042
the right man will come along

09:41.083 --> 09:42.249
for me to fertilize those eggs

09:42.250 --> 09:43.250
and you know what?

09:43.292 --> 09:44.375
Knock, knock,

09:44.417 --> 09:45.916
who's there?

09:45.917 --> 09:47.250
Possibly, hopefully the guy

09:47.292 --> 09:49.708
who will fertilize those eggs.

09:49.750 --> 09:51.271
- You've been through

09:51.272 --> 09:52.792
numerous tests with doctors.

09:52.833 --> 09:54.083
- Yeah.
- And they've all told you

09:54.125 --> 09:55.375
that your f... ing uterus

09:55.376 --> 09:56.625
looks like

09:56.667 --> 09:58.624
the best uterus on the planet.

09:58.625 --> 10:00.208
Showroom uterus.

10:00.250 --> 10:01.917
- Yeah, showroom quality.

10:01.958 --> 10:04.125
- Uh-huh.
- When we try to have a baby,

10:04.128 --> 10:05.209
it's not just the fertility

10:05.210 --> 10:06.291
of the woman,

10:06.292 --> 10:08.208
it's also the sperm count.

10:08.250 --> 10:09.917
All you have to do is...

10:09.958 --> 10:12.291
- Jerk off in a cup, no?

10:12.292 --> 10:14.125
- Yeah.
- Been there, done that.

10:14.167 --> 10:15.458
- You've already done that?

10:15.500 --> 10:16.958
- Not in a cup but trust me,

10:17.000 --> 10:18.146
I got the jerking off

10:18.147 --> 10:19.291
part down pat.

10:19.292 --> 10:20.875
Anytime you wanna go, I'm down.

10:20.917 --> 10:22.230
- I would love

10:22.231 --> 10:23.542
nothing more than to see

10:23.583 --> 10:25.521
a little Tommy-mj thing

10:25.522 --> 10:27.458
running around.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.542
Boom, cute,

10:29.583 --> 10:30.958
probably very smart

10:30.959 --> 10:32.332
and very funny.

10:32.333 --> 10:33.666
When I get pregnant,

10:33.667 --> 10:34.750
if I can't smoke,

10:34.751 --> 10:35.832
you can't smoke.

10:35.833 --> 10:37.042
If I can't drink,

10:37.043 --> 10:38.250
you can't drink.

10:38.292 --> 10:39.875
- Don't worry, I'm gonna be

10:39.876 --> 10:41.458
sympathetically suffering

10:41.500 --> 10:42.625
the whole time.

10:42.667 --> 10:43.667
I fully...

10:43.708 --> 10:45.667
I fully expect you

10:45.708 --> 10:47.125
to be moody.

10:47.167 --> 10:49.125
- Am I sure that I wanna
- procreate with you, crazy?

10:49.167 --> 10:50.250
- I wouldn't.

10:50.292 --> 10:52.792
Honestly, I'd tell you're nuts.

10:52.833 --> 10:54.625
- Alright.

10:54.667 --> 10:55.667
- Coming up...

10:55.708 --> 10:57.000
- You're wearing
- patent leather loubies

10:57.003 --> 10:58.166
and I see whipped cream.

10:58.167 --> 10:59.792
What is going on?

10:59.833 --> 11:01.667
- Everyone stop talking
- about anything

11:01.670 --> 11:02.999
you were talking about.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.083
She hit her, stop defending gg.

11:05.125 --> 11:06.146
Stop talking

11:06.147 --> 11:07.167
your nonsense you talk.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.666
Let's honestly, at this dinner,

11:08.667 --> 11:11.625
leave old sh... here and move on.

11:28.750 --> 11:29.874
- Babe, come on in.

11:29.875 --> 11:31.042
- Yo.
- Hi.

11:31.045 --> 11:32.207
- What's up, toya?

11:32.208 --> 11:33.667
What up, toya?

11:33.708 --> 11:35.207
What's up, boo boo?

11:35.208 --> 11:36.708
- You're just
- a little skinny bitch.

11:36.750 --> 11:38.042
- She's a baby.

11:38.083 --> 11:39.625
- What's going on up in...

11:39.667 --> 11:40.707
- Hi.

11:40.708 --> 11:42.500
- What the f... are you wearing?

11:42.542 --> 11:43.708
- Oh my god.

11:43.750 --> 11:44.874
- Your titties are out,

11:44.875 --> 11:46.042
you're wearing

11:46.043 --> 11:47.207
like, patent leather...

11:47.208 --> 11:48.292
Are they loubies?

11:48.333 --> 11:49.792
- You're wearing
- patent leather loubies

11:49.833 --> 11:51.208
- and I see whipped cream.
- Have a seat.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.707
- Merce, what is going on?

11:53.708 --> 11:56.333
- I'm going to Dr. ghadir

11:56.375 --> 11:58.000
with Tommy

11:58.042 --> 11:59.583
to get a semen analysis.

11:59.625 --> 12:01.749
I don't want him to masturbate

12:01.750 --> 12:02.750
to anything else,

12:02.792 --> 12:04.667
I want it to be to me.

12:04.708 --> 12:05.750
- So, I know
- you're not trying to...

12:05.792 --> 12:07.167
- You're gonna take
- the pictures.

12:07.208 --> 12:08.249
- What?

12:08.250 --> 12:10.083
- The only way
- to give a semen analysis

12:10.125 --> 12:12.249
is to ejaculate in a cup.

12:12.250 --> 12:13.333
Why can't I be the material

12:13.375 --> 12:16.667
that he uses to accomplish that?

12:16.708 --> 12:17.875
- Take that off.

12:21.458 --> 12:22.875
- You look great.
- Get on your back.

12:22.917 --> 12:24.292
- Wait, wait, wait.

12:25.375 --> 12:26.917
- Okay.
- I need that back.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.000
- No.

12:28.042 --> 12:30.333
Now put one hand on,

12:30.375 --> 12:31.583
remove one breastisis

12:31.625 --> 12:33.583
- and put your hand
- on your nipple.

12:33.625 --> 12:35.000
Let me see your nipple, watch.

12:35.042 --> 12:36.750
- You're starting to salivate.
- You have to trust me.

12:36.792 --> 12:37.917
- You're starting to salivate

12:37.958 --> 12:38.958
- a little.
- Watch,

12:38.961 --> 12:40.250
- just put your hand right here.
- Stop.

12:40.292 --> 12:42.125
- Mj is very sexy

12:42.167 --> 12:44.125
- but I've been seeing
- mj's titties

12:44.167 --> 12:45.542
and her box

12:45.543 --> 12:46.917
from back in the day.

12:46.958 --> 12:47.958
- Oh sh...
- No,

12:47.961 --> 12:49.375
just place it gently, gently.

12:49.417 --> 12:50.457
- Okay, there you go.

12:50.458 --> 12:52.708
For me, does nothing.

12:52.750 --> 12:55.292
And by the way, I'm gay, hello.

12:55.333 --> 12:56.917
- Gentle.

12:56.958 --> 12:58.124
Yeah, not about having it

12:58.125 --> 12:59.750
- in my hair.
- Go like this.

13:00.958 --> 13:02.042
Yes, there you go.

13:02.043 --> 13:03.125
- Alright, are you sure?

13:04.292 --> 13:06.375
- Do it.

13:06.417 --> 13:07.917
Oh, hell yeah.

13:09.750 --> 13:11.124
I want your baby batter.

13:11.125 --> 13:14.083
- Baby, I want your baby batter.

13:14.125 --> 13:15.250
It's perfect,

13:15.292 --> 13:16.792
Tommy has a sweet tooth,

13:16.833 --> 13:18.124
I have sweet tits,

13:18.125 --> 13:19.375
let's bring them together

13:19.376 --> 13:20.625
with maraschino cherries

13:20.667 --> 13:21.999
and whipped cream.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.500
- Tilt your head back.

13:25.333 --> 13:26.417
- Are you sure it looks good?

13:26.458 --> 13:27.833
- No, don't bite the banana.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.083
- [Inaudible]

13:29.125 --> 13:30.750
- Stop trying to eat it.

13:30.792 --> 13:32.333
- Do I have to be serious?
- Yeah.

13:32.375 --> 13:33.625
- I wish I was there

13:33.626 --> 13:34.875
with you right now.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.500
[Inaudible]

13:38.542 --> 13:40.083
- I think we are covered.

13:40.125 --> 13:41.479
- Mm.

13:41.480 --> 13:42.832
- He's gonna get the gist.

13:42.833 --> 13:43.958
- All right.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.958
- Is this not
- a little premature?

13:46.000 --> 13:47.584
- What?

13:47.585 --> 13:49.167
- Having his sperm tested?

13:49.208 --> 13:50.292
- No, babe.

13:50.333 --> 13:51.832
Well, we met almost a year ago.

20:35.250 --> 20:36.313
- My ghormeh sabzi

20:36.314 --> 20:37.375
is like, cloudy,

20:37.417 --> 20:38.667
it doesn't look...

20:38.708 --> 20:40.833
- Let it boil for another hour

20:40.875 --> 20:43.249
but don't make it too high.

20:43.250 --> 20:44.583
- For one more hour.
- On low.

20:44.586 --> 20:45.833
- Thank you.
- Bye bye.

20:45.875 --> 20:48.042
- Shabbat shalom.

20:48.083 --> 20:50.417
- This is the bademjaan.

20:50.458 --> 20:51.479
It's gonna be the gondi,

20:51.480 --> 20:52.500
I have to make that.

20:52.542 --> 20:54.167
- Do you think this is good size
- or should they be bigger?

20:54.208 --> 20:55.375
- Little bit bigger, Jessica.

20:55.417 --> 20:56.417
- Okay.

20:56.418 --> 20:58.291
- Such a good job, mama.

20:58.292 --> 21:00.083
- I'm gonna slap you
- with raw chicken.

21:01.917 --> 21:03.124
- I'm lucky to have a wife

21:03.125 --> 21:05.625
who makes bomb,

21:05.667 --> 21:07.291
bomb persian food.

21:07.292 --> 21:08.417
I mean, so good

21:08.458 --> 21:10.458
- that even my mom compliments her
- on her cooking.

21:10.461 --> 21:11.624
- I have a lot to do.

21:11.625 --> 21:12.750
- I'm gonna go
- get the alcohol, okay?

21:12.792 --> 21:15.208
- Please.
- Like any good persian shabbat,

21:15.250 --> 21:17.083
we're gonna get everyone drunk.

21:17.125 --> 21:18.417
- Having my friends over
- for shabbat dinner,

21:18.458 --> 21:19.542
it means so much

21:19.543 --> 21:20.624
in so many different ways,

21:20.625 --> 21:22.250
spiritually,

21:22.251 --> 21:23.875
mentally, emotionally.

21:23.917 --> 21:25.542
- Come to my home,
- let me break bread with you

21:25.583 --> 21:27.083
so I could build a bridge

21:27.125 --> 21:28.375
that we can cross over

21:28.376 --> 21:29.625
and become friends again.

21:29.667 --> 21:30.875
- Should we use that Tiffany's

21:30.917 --> 21:32.208
for one of the maker's marks,

21:32.250 --> 21:33.625
- because you know,
- the Tiffany's crystal

21:33.628 --> 21:34.875
that we got for the wedding.

21:34.917 --> 21:36.208
I wanted to use it.

21:36.250 --> 21:37.625
- Yeah but if they break it,
- I'll be upset.

21:37.667 --> 21:38.750
- No one's gonna break it.

21:38.792 --> 21:40.292
- You never know with this crew.

21:40.333 --> 21:41.667
- But really, I wanna use it
- for something.

21:41.708 --> 21:43.083
Can I have it as decoration?

21:43.084 --> 21:44.458
- Okay.

21:44.500 --> 21:46.332
Having everyone over for shabbat

21:46.333 --> 21:47.499
is causing me some anxiety.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.000
- Where are we gonna put
- the dogs?

21:49.003 --> 21:50.750
- You have a bunch

21:50.751 --> 21:52.499
of judgmental iranian friends,

21:52.500 --> 21:53.875
anxiety level

21:53.876 --> 21:55.250
increases very much.

21:56.375 --> 21:57.833
- Babe?
- Yes?

21:57.875 --> 21:59.499
- Where do you want it?

21:59.500 --> 22:00.750
- This table needs to be at...

22:00.792 --> 22:01.958
- Not like that.
- Where do you want it?

22:02.000 --> 22:03.083
- I'm confused right now.
- Why?

22:03.125 --> 22:04.500
- Because this was
- supposed to be dinner.

22:04.503 --> 22:05.625
- Well, it's not
- the dinner table.

22:05.667 --> 22:07.500
- This is supposed
- to go where dinner is.

22:07.503 --> 22:08.833
- And where's the bar gonna be?
- I don't know.

22:08.875 --> 22:10.500
- I think the dinner table
- should be here.

22:10.503 --> 22:12.417
- No, you're ruining my plan.

22:12.458 --> 22:13.500
- Trust me.
- Trust me.

22:13.503 --> 22:15.000
- You're gonna have
- the food here.

22:15.042 --> 22:17.082
- I don't have time,
- I have a lot of things to do.

22:18.375 --> 22:21.458
[Music playing]

22:25.208 --> 22:26.542
- Do you know
- where you're going?

22:26.545 --> 22:27.792
- Yeah.

22:27.833 --> 22:29.833
- I wonder when it's gonna
- start cooling down.

22:31.042 --> 22:32.167
- I don't know.

22:33.208 --> 22:35.000
- You're gonna like the house.

22:35.042 --> 22:36.375
It's an example

22:36.376 --> 22:37.708
so you can see a house

22:37.750 --> 22:40.208
that's all concrete and glass.

22:40.250 --> 22:41.396
I wanna build a house

22:41.397 --> 22:42.542
with no wood

22:42.583 --> 22:43.707
and I wanna have an atrium

22:43.708 --> 22:44.833
in the middle of it

22:44.875 --> 22:46.292
with a Japanese maple.

22:46.333 --> 22:47.375
- You just make up
- all these decisions

22:47.417 --> 22:49.374
without consulting me first?

22:49.375 --> 22:51.000
- No, these are things
- I would like.

22:51.042 --> 22:52.667
- Okay, well I would like
- to have an aviary.

22:52.708 --> 22:53.833
- I don't... can we...

22:53.875 --> 22:55.292
- I would like to have
- a rooftop garden.

22:55.333 --> 22:57.042
- Why would you wanna have
- fruit trees

22:57.045 --> 22:58.375
on the roof of the house?

22:58.417 --> 23:00.333
- Honey, it doesn't have
- to be fruit trees.

23:00.375 --> 23:01.375
- I'm just trying to show

23:01.376 --> 23:02.375
Adam a house that,

23:02.376 --> 23:03.479
you know, I'd like

23:03.480 --> 23:04.582
to build one day

23:04.583 --> 23:05.833
and he's just not

23:05.834 --> 23:07.082
even having it.

23:07.083 --> 23:08.167
I'm not sure

23:08.208 --> 23:09.542
if that's gonna work.

23:09.583 --> 23:11.208
- Well, honey, I'm not sure
- if some of your ideas

23:11.250 --> 23:13.000
are gonna work for me either.

23:13.042 --> 23:14.250
- I thought Reza and i
- made progress,

23:14.253 --> 23:16.083
but I feel like in a way,

23:16.125 --> 23:17.208
mj's right.

23:17.250 --> 23:18.250
- From what I see,

23:18.292 --> 23:19.500
is that you want equality

23:19.542 --> 23:21.250
- within this relationship.
- Yep.

23:21.253 --> 23:22.875
- You want your voice
- to be as loud.

23:22.917 --> 23:23.917
- I'm being excluded.

23:23.918 --> 23:25.292
I feel like my opinion

23:25.293 --> 23:26.667
does not matter.

23:26.708 --> 23:28.082
I want my opinion to matter

23:28.083 --> 23:29.667
just as much as his.

23:37.583 --> 23:38.708
- What do you think?

23:40.583 --> 23:42.082
- What is it exactly

23:42.083 --> 23:43.416
about the house that you like?

23:43.417 --> 23:45.042
- Remember five trillion times

23:45.083 --> 23:46.457
I've told you that I wanna build

23:46.458 --> 23:47.957
a house with no wood?

23:47.958 --> 23:49.291
This is a great example

23:49.292 --> 23:51.583
of someone who's doing that.

23:53.583 --> 23:54.624
- So, all the wiring

23:54.625 --> 23:55.688
is gonna be inside

23:55.689 --> 23:56.750
this concrete?

23:56.792 --> 23:57.792
- The way I wanna do it,

23:57.793 --> 23:59.792
I wanna do the wiring

23:59.833 --> 24:01.208
on the outside.

24:01.250 --> 24:02.291
I'm just talking about

24:02.292 --> 24:04.291
do you like this concept?

24:04.292 --> 24:06.124
- Like the gravel?

24:06.125 --> 24:07.291
- I'm showing you this house

24:07.292 --> 24:08.375
- and the only thing you like
- is the gravel?

24:08.417 --> 24:10.083
- No, well...

24:10.125 --> 24:11.250
- I'm noticing distance

24:11.292 --> 24:12.833
between Adam and I.

24:14.292 --> 24:17.042
He's not wanting to like

24:17.083 --> 24:18.375
anything I like right now,

24:18.417 --> 24:19.457
for some reason.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.917
But clearly,

24:20.958 --> 24:22.791
this is coming from somewhere.

24:22.792 --> 24:24.708
- I'm gonna get
- to the bottom of it

24:24.750 --> 24:26.666
but in the meantime,

24:26.667 --> 24:28.625
it's bugging the sh... out of me.

- Nice to have you.

25:01.458 --> 25:02.499
- Even though we're not ready

25:02.500 --> 25:03.999
to get pregnant today,

25:04.000 --> 25:05.832
I just want to make sure

25:05.833 --> 25:07.104
that Tommy's swimmers

25:07.105 --> 25:08.374
are strong,

25:08.375 --> 25:10.207
so when we are ready,

25:10.208 --> 25:11.707
we can make it happen.

25:11.708 --> 25:13.041
So, you told me to find

25:13.042 --> 25:14.167
a sperm donor

25:14.208 --> 25:15.500
for my eggs, didn't you?

25:15.542 --> 25:16.542
- Yeah, she put an ad

25:16.543 --> 25:17.874
on craigslist, I answered.

25:17.875 --> 25:19.792
- Stop. Didn't you?

- I told you to meet a nice guy

25:21.208 --> 25:22.542

25:23.583 --> 25:24.707
- And what's going on now?

25:24.708 --> 25:25.792
- Now...
- I don't know how good

25:25.833 --> 25:27.500
my boys swim.

25:27.542 --> 25:28.708
- He's saying that
- because he hasn't gotten

25:28.750 --> 25:30.167
anyone pregnant before.

25:31.875 --> 25:33.333
- We need sperm

25:33.375 --> 25:34.500
good necks, good tails,

25:34.542 --> 25:36.500
- with good movement,
- in order for them

25:36.542 --> 25:37.875
- to be able to make it
- into the egg.

25:37.917 --> 25:39.374
This is a picture of the sperm,

- you're being cute

- Not a problem.

- great.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.166
- I haven't worn this

27:42.167 --> 27:43.499
in a really long time,

27:43.500 --> 27:45.333
it's vintage Gucci.

27:45.375 --> 27:47.000
- Okay, so it's old.
- You like it?

27:47.003 --> 27:48.500
- It's old.
- No, it's not old.

27:48.542 --> 27:50.499
And I foolishly bought this

27:50.500 --> 27:53.125
other one without trying it on.

27:53.167 --> 27:54.167
With this one,

27:54.168 --> 27:57.000
I look like a 10-pound burrito

27:57.042 --> 27:59.667
in like, a 5-pound tortilla.

27:59.708 --> 28:01.541
Do I go with the retro Gucci

28:01.542 --> 28:03.375
- or the...
- Retro because it's blue

28:03.417 --> 28:04.542
and it matches my eyes.

28:04.583 --> 28:06.125
- Okay, cool.
- So, who is coming?

28:06.167 --> 28:08.458
- Everybody except golnesa.

28:08.500 --> 28:09.834
Shabbat's like,

28:09.835 --> 28:11.167
a really special ceremony,

28:11.208 --> 28:12.208
I love it.

28:12.209 --> 28:13.375
This is the first time

28:13.417 --> 28:16.041
Mike has had us over as a group.

28:16.042 --> 28:17.707
I know the significance

28:17.708 --> 28:19.374
and I hope it's not lost

28:19.375 --> 28:21.374
amongst the other guests.

28:21.375 --> 28:22.875
- Did I ever tell you
- what mj and I had chatted

28:22.878 --> 28:24.207
about the other night?

28:24.208 --> 28:25.541
- No, but I have a funny feeling

28:25.542 --> 28:27.541
you're gonna tell me now.

28:27.542 --> 28:28.792
- What do you tell her about

28:28.793 --> 28:30.041
mine and yours relationship?

28:30.042 --> 28:31.707
- Facts.

28:31.708 --> 28:33.041
- She just kind of seemed like

28:33.042 --> 28:34.875
- we weren't as good
- as I thought we were.

28:34.917 --> 28:36.582
- You're with a very dominating

28:36.583 --> 28:38.042
Alpha male

28:38.083 --> 28:39.083
and I support you

28:39.084 --> 28:40.875
wanting to pace yourself,

28:40.917 --> 28:42.084
I think that's good

28:42.085 --> 28:43.249
for your relationship.

28:43.250 --> 28:45.417
- Oh, I feel like
- she's just throwing some shade.

28:45.458 --> 28:47.916
- I knew Adam was acting crazy.

28:47.917 --> 28:49.916
I couldn't put my finger on it

28:49.917 --> 28:51.417
but now that he's telling me

28:51.458 --> 28:52.917
about mj,

28:52.958 --> 28:54.250
I'm connecting all

28:54.292 --> 28:55.749
of these motherf... ing dots.

28:55.750 --> 28:57.416
It's got a crooked weave

28:57.417 --> 28:58.749
and it smells like Tequila.

28:58.750 --> 29:00.082
I think it has more to do

29:00.083 --> 29:01.208
with mj than it has to do

29:01.209 --> 29:02.333
with you and I.

29:02.375 --> 29:03.417
- Does she not like
- seeing you happy?

29:03.458 --> 29:04.542
- Does she want you
- all to herself?

29:04.583 --> 29:05.708
- No, you know what?

29:05.750 --> 29:08.250
She is coming into her own

29:08.292 --> 29:10.708
and somehow she feels like

29:10.750 --> 29:14.083
maybe you should be experiencing

29:14.125 --> 29:15.667
a renaissance like she is.

29:15.708 --> 29:17.249
I don't know what it is.

29:17.250 --> 29:19.291
I need to put a cork in mj.

29:19.292 --> 29:20.708
It's one thing to not want me

29:20.750 --> 29:22.457
to get married in this fashion

29:22.458 --> 29:24.375
and making your voice heard,

29:24.417 --> 29:25.813
but focus

29:25.814 --> 29:27.208
in a different direction.

29:27.250 --> 29:28.291
You're like,

29:28.292 --> 29:30.042
causing a lot of tension here

29:30.083 --> 29:31.958
- and I'm about
- to get married, bitch,

29:31.961 --> 29:33.292
and he's hopefully

29:33.333 --> 29:35.167
still gonna get surprised.

29:36.458 --> 29:37.458
You want a little

29:37.459 --> 29:38.458
something-something?

29:38.459 --> 29:40.083
- No.

29:40.125 --> 29:41.208
- Okay.

29:41.250 --> 29:44.250
[Music playing]

29:50.292 --> 29:53.250
- [Speaking Hebrew]

29:55.292 --> 29:57.291
- Shabbat is our sabbath

29:57.292 --> 29:59.291
and it's Friday night sundown

29:59.292 --> 30:01.666
to Saturday sundown.

30:01.667 --> 30:04.125
This shabbat dinner is like mine

30:04.167 --> 30:05.458
and Jessica's coming out party

30:05.500 --> 30:06.832
to the group.

30:06.833 --> 30:08.083
- Shabbat shalom.
- Love you,

30:08.125 --> 30:09.333
I pray for you.

30:10.333 --> 30:12.166
- Go get ready.

30:12.167 --> 30:15.167
[Music playing]

30:22.000 --> 30:23.250
- This is it?
- This is it,

30:23.292 --> 30:25.167
after you.

30:25.208 --> 30:26.417
- Hi.

30:26.418 --> 30:27.625
- Hello,

30:27.667 --> 30:28.667
- welcome.
- Salam.

30:28.670 --> 30:30.000
- This is it?
- Yep.

30:30.042 --> 30:32.125
- It's shabbat,
- we're supposed to get drunk.

30:32.167 --> 30:33.332
- That's what I thought.

30:33.333 --> 30:35.000
- The rabbis get together
- and get drunk.

30:35.042 --> 30:36.958
- Welcome.
- You look nice.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.833
- Thank you.
- [Inaudible]

30:38.836 --> 30:40.332
- Oh my god, it's so beautiful

30:40.333 --> 30:42.374
out here.

30:42.375 --> 30:44.208
- Reza, I only
- made gondi for you

30:44.250 --> 30:45.542
- because I don't...
- You're so sweet.

30:45.545 --> 30:47.375
- It's really hard,
- so please eat.

30:47.378 --> 30:48.707
- I love you.

30:48.708 --> 30:50.021
Shabbat was a huge part

30:50.022 --> 30:51.333
of my life growing up

30:51.375 --> 30:53.000
and so was gondi.

30:53.042 --> 30:54.875
Gondi is this matzah ball,

30:54.917 --> 30:56.292
round ball-looking thing

30:56.333 --> 30:58.167
- that's not really made
- out of matzah,

30:58.208 --> 30:59.707
it's really delicious.

30:59.708 --> 31:00.958
Gondi reminds me of my family

31:00.959 --> 31:02.207
in New York

31:02.208 --> 31:04.333
and it makes me very happy.

31:04.375 --> 31:05.459
Jessica, [Speaking farsi]

31:05.460 --> 31:06.542
- Seriously.

31:06.583 --> 31:07.958
- Oh my god.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.874
- I think we need to turn up.

31:09.875 --> 31:11.875
- Mike said that you turn up
- on shabbat.

31:11.878 --> 31:13.208
- Hell yeah.
- You do.

31:13.211 --> 31:14.438
- Actually, it's a mitzvah

31:14.439 --> 31:15.667
to get drunk on shabbat.

31:15.708 --> 31:17.208
- See?
- And have sex.

31:17.211 --> 31:18.875
- Oh.
- Yes, through a sheet.

31:18.917 --> 31:20.063
- Okay, through a sheet.

31:20.064 --> 31:21.208
- Shut up.

31:21.250 --> 31:22.375
- Hi guys.

31:22.417 --> 31:23.542
What up, Mikey?

31:23.583 --> 31:25.083
- [Speaking farsi]
- How are you?

31:25.086 --> 31:26.833
- Welcome.
- Is that the doorbell?

31:28.917 --> 31:30.000
- Yes?

31:30.042 --> 31:31.083
- Hey.
- Hi.

31:31.086 --> 31:32.250
Hi babe, how are you?

31:32.292 --> 31:33.583
- Wow.
- What's going on?

31:34.625 --> 31:36.250
- Mm, it smells like tahdig
- in here.

31:36.253 --> 31:37.500
- The spread is crazy,

31:37.542 --> 31:38.667
it looks great.

31:38.708 --> 31:40.667
- Jessica, what kind of khoresh
- did you make?

31:40.708 --> 31:42.667
- [Speaking farsi]

31:42.708 --> 31:44.417
- It seems simple but actually
- those simple dishes take...

31:44.420 --> 31:45.749
- It's a lot of steps.

31:45.750 --> 31:46.833
- Yeah.
- Hey Mike, your married life's

31:46.875 --> 31:48.208
- treating you well, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

31:48.250 --> 31:49.417
For men,

31:49.458 --> 31:51.021
it's the end

31:51.022 --> 31:52.582
of your single life.

31:52.583 --> 31:53.750
- And it's the beginning
- of your married life.

31:53.792 --> 31:54.875
- Yeah.
- It's not just the men.

31:54.917 --> 31:56.083
- [Inaudible]
- Yeah, no, no.

31:56.086 --> 31:57.250
- But how do you feel
- being married?

31:57.292 --> 31:58.375
- That's a good way [Inaudible]
- I love it.

31:58.417 --> 31:59.583
- You feel more like a man,
- right?

31:59.625 --> 32:01.500
- I love you, baby. Thank you.
- I love you, too.

32:01.542 --> 32:03.042
- I don't know what the f...
- She was thinking.

32:03.083 --> 32:04.250
- Since he's...
- So he's wondering...

32:04.292 --> 32:05.625
- I was thinking...
- Since he's wondering.

32:05.628 --> 32:06.771
And if you're gonna put me

32:06.772 --> 32:07.917
on the spot,

32:07.958 --> 32:10.625
I married a very, very handsome,

32:10.667 --> 32:12.250
kind-hearted gentleman.

32:12.292 --> 32:13.542
- Aww.

32:13.583 --> 32:15.292
- Coming to Mike and Jessica's
- tonight for shabbat,

32:15.295 --> 32:17.083
- I'm really excited
- because I've literally

32:17.125 --> 32:18.542
been waiting to get invited.

32:18.583 --> 32:20.292
- You know, with persians,
- we don't just like...

32:20.295 --> 32:21.708
When you move to a new house,

32:21.750 --> 32:23.250
you wait to get invited.

32:23.292 --> 32:24.292
You know, you don't just

32:24.293 --> 32:25.293
like, drop in.

32:25.333 --> 32:26.417
- Cheers. Salamati.

32:26.458 --> 32:27.624
Thank you very, very much.

32:27.625 --> 32:28.625
- Love you guys,
- thank you for coming.

32:28.667 --> 32:29.958
- Cheers. Thank you.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.292
- What's going on?
- I haven't seen you for a minute.

32:32.333 --> 32:34.124
- After shervin's party,

32:34.125 --> 32:35.583
I was kind of sad and upset

32:35.625 --> 32:37.291
with what was going on

32:37.292 --> 32:40.457
and I think golnesa needs

32:40.458 --> 32:41.957
like,

32:41.958 --> 32:42.958
serious help.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.292
- I can't, you know,
- after somebody

32:44.295 --> 32:46.415
- lays a hand on you,
- you can't really talk to them.

32:47.708 --> 32:49.750
- Throw this sh... on my hand.
- Did you just hit me?

32:49.792 --> 32:50.833
- Did you just put
- your f... ing hands

32:50.836 --> 32:52.083
- on me, bitch?
- You threw cake at me.

32:52.125 --> 32:53.750
- Dude, stop.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

32:53.792 --> 32:54.833
- She needs to get
- some help, man.

32:54.836 --> 32:56.667
- This is crazy.
- Any single person

32:56.708 --> 32:58.666
that loves her unconditionally,

32:58.667 --> 32:59.750
that shows her

32:59.792 --> 33:01.167
that she'll be there for her,

33:01.208 --> 33:02.667
she'll jump you,

33:02.708 --> 33:04.250
- she'll f... you up
- because she thinks

33:04.292 --> 33:05.583
that you love her enough

33:05.625 --> 33:06.832
to say it's okay.

33:06.833 --> 33:08.625
I've tried to reach out,

33:08.667 --> 33:09.667
be there for golnesa

33:09.668 --> 33:10.709
but she has to want

33:10.710 --> 33:11.750
to help herself

33:11.792 --> 33:13.292
and she doesn't.

33:14.500 --> 33:16.083
- You know when golnesa's mad
- at somebody,

33:16.125 --> 33:17.667
- you can't really reason
- with her?

33:17.670 --> 33:19.292
- You have to make this right,

33:19.333 --> 33:20.292
- this is a bitch
- that's in our circle.

33:20.333 --> 33:21.417
- Me?
- Yes.

33:21.458 --> 33:22.458
- What about her?

33:22.500 --> 33:23.667
- What do you mean,
- what about her?

33:23.708 --> 33:25.292
- Do I have to make it right
- or do we both have

33:25.333 --> 33:26.500
- to make it right?
- Both of you need

33:26.503 --> 33:29.042
- to make it right but I'm talking
- to you right now.

33:29.043 --> 33:30.042
- I'm talking to you.
- How do you make it right?

33:30.083 --> 33:31.167
How does she make it right?

33:31.208 --> 33:32.958
- You guys were friends
- with her before,

33:33.000 --> 33:34.167
- how did you make it
- right before?

33:34.208 --> 33:35.208
- You never had a problem
- with her?

33:35.211 --> 33:36.792
- That golnesa doesn't exist.

33:38.333 --> 33:39.500
- F... ing asifa, man.

33:39.542 --> 33:40.792
It's like, welcome to my home.

33:40.833 --> 33:42.625
- Oh, let's talk about golnesa,
- great, yeah, absolutely.

33:42.667 --> 33:43.874
Oh, nothing more

33:43.875 --> 33:45.208
that I wanna talk about

33:45.250 --> 33:46.542
than golnesa.

33:46.583 --> 33:47.792
- And then after the cake

33:47.793 --> 33:49.000
came out, you know...

33:49.042 --> 33:50.209
- Ah! Michael.

33:50.210 --> 33:51.374
- Very serious.

33:51.375 --> 33:52.542
- Coming up...

33:52.583 --> 33:53.875
- Did you change your mind?

33:53.917 --> 33:55.792
- You better change it.
- I'm over here watching you,

33:55.833 --> 33:57.625
- I hear you.
- I don't wanna be lying

33:57.667 --> 33:58.792
to Adam.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.708
- It's a long day
- uh-hmm.

34:04.711 --> 34:05.917
- And then

34:05.918 --> 34:07.125
after the cake came out,

34:07.167 --> 34:08.875
you know, it was...

34:08.917 --> 34:10.917
- I'm being serious.

34:10.958 --> 34:12.083
- There's an elephant
- in the room

34:12.086 --> 34:13.249
that nobody's addressing.

34:13.250 --> 34:14.333
- Which is?
- Golnesa has

34:14.375 --> 34:15.749
a drinking problem.

34:15.750 --> 34:17.250
- It's a combination of that

34:17.292 --> 34:19.083
- and being somebody
- who's dealing with

34:19.125 --> 34:20.583
- a lot of insecurities
- and a lot of problems.

34:20.625 --> 34:21.688
- And she's dealing

34:21.689 --> 34:22.749
with medical issues.

34:22.750 --> 34:24.208
She has nobody,

34:24.250 --> 34:26.082
she has no goals, no job

34:26.083 --> 34:27.167
[speaking farsi]

34:27.208 --> 34:28.417
Should we shoot her?

34:28.458 --> 34:29.833
- I'm sorry, it's not okay.
- Should we shoot her?

34:29.875 --> 34:31.416
- No.

34:31.417 --> 34:32.667
Everyone makes excuses,

34:32.708 --> 34:33.833
she's in a really bad place.

34:33.875 --> 34:35.708
Okay, great, now what?

34:35.750 --> 34:37.333
- She did throw cake at me.

34:37.375 --> 34:38.708
- Just like she doesn't remember
- what she did

34:38.750 --> 34:40.000
with Mike a long time ago,

34:40.042 --> 34:41.917
- she probably doesn't remember
- throwing cake at me.

34:41.958 --> 34:43.375
- Everyone, let's honestly,

34:43.417 --> 34:44.480
at this dinner,

34:44.481 --> 34:45.542
leave old sh... here

34:45.583 --> 34:46.583
and move on.

34:46.584 --> 34:47.749
Asifa,

34:47.750 --> 34:49.333
stop talking about anything

34:49.375 --> 34:50.582
you were talking about.

34:50.583 --> 34:52.583
She hit her, stop defending gg.

34:52.625 --> 34:54.583
- Stop talking
- your nonsense you talk.

34:54.625 --> 34:55.708
- Let's move on.
- Yes.

34:55.750 --> 34:57.375
- Jessica's a stubborn bitch

34:57.417 --> 34:58.625
and good for her

34:58.667 --> 35:00.125
- for putting
- her f... ing foot down,

35:00.128 --> 35:01.957
like, she's a tough cookie.

35:01.958 --> 35:02.958
- No sh...
- If you're moving on,

35:03.000 --> 35:04.708
say it now or if not,

35:04.750 --> 35:05.792
- get the f... out of my life.
- Amen to that.

35:05.795 --> 35:06.917
- I can't deal with it,

35:06.958 --> 35:08.375
I really can't deal with it.

35:08.417 --> 35:10.208
- F... yeah, that's what I love
- about my wife.

35:10.250 --> 35:12.000
She's a f... ing

35:12.001 --> 35:13.750
Italian lion, dude.

35:13.792 --> 35:14.792
She does not f... around.

35:14.793 --> 35:15.958
- Yeah, we're a group of friends

35:16.000 --> 35:17.458
- and it's like,
- we have to be more sensitive

35:17.461 --> 35:18.750
- towards each other.
- I agree.

35:18.792 --> 35:20.417
- And if you're so sensitive
- about... not you,

35:20.458 --> 35:22.458
- any one of us is sensitive
- about what somebody does to you,

35:22.461 --> 35:24.124
like, also don't do crazy sh...

35:24.125 --> 35:25.375
To other people.

35:26.792 --> 35:27.957
- Sherv, what are you drinking?

35:27.958 --> 35:29.250
- I'm in,
- whatever you're drinking.

35:29.292 --> 35:30.542
- First, we drink,

35:30.583 --> 35:31.957
then we drink some more,

35:31.958 --> 35:33.125
then we eat.

35:34.667 --> 35:36.583
- Merce, can I talk to you
- for a sec?

35:36.625 --> 35:37.750
- Yeah.

35:39.833 --> 35:40.958
- Remember the other day

35:41.000 --> 35:42.396
when I shared

35:42.397 --> 35:43.792
that amazing news with you

35:43.833 --> 35:45.625
and you took a big dump on me?

35:45.667 --> 35:46.667
- Okay, no,

35:46.668 --> 35:47.668
I'm not ready for this.

35:47.708 --> 35:48.792
Why?

35:48.833 --> 35:50.125
- What do you mean, why?
- Don't...

35:50.167 --> 35:51.417
- It's been sitting
- with me the whole...

35:51.458 --> 35:52.833
Since that happened.

35:54.333 --> 35:56.000
Clearly, mj's having an impact

35:56.042 --> 35:57.792
on my relationship with Adam

35:57.833 --> 35:59.292
and I don't need mj

35:59.333 --> 36:00.792
creating problems

36:00.833 --> 36:02.666
where there aren't any.

36:02.667 --> 36:05.000
- What are you gonna do to me?
- [Inaudible]

36:05.042 --> 36:06.250
- Did you change your mind?

36:06.292 --> 36:07.333
You better change it.

36:07.375 --> 36:09.333
- Shut the f... up.
- Huh?

36:09.375 --> 36:10.792
- Adam might hear you.

36:12.333 --> 36:13.583
- Reza and Adam,

36:13.625 --> 36:14.750
- the reason
- they didn't get married

36:14.792 --> 36:16.374
in the first place was because

36:16.375 --> 36:17.792
- they didn't wanna rush
- through the wedding.

36:17.833 --> 36:19.041
I just wanna make sure

36:19.042 --> 36:22.041
they both are equally strong

36:22.042 --> 36:23.707
and feel equally ready.

36:23.708 --> 36:25.388
- So what do you want
- to go through with?

36:26.542 --> 36:27.875
- What?
- Whatever you were talking

36:27.878 --> 36:29.042
- to mj about.
- Huh?

36:29.045 --> 36:30.958
Adam was in close proximity

36:31.000 --> 36:32.625
and he heard his name,

36:32.667 --> 36:34.167
so now I have to come up

36:34.208 --> 36:36.375
with something

36:36.417 --> 36:37.708
to tell Adam

36:37.750 --> 36:39.207
that's gonna, you know,

36:39.208 --> 36:40.707
cool his jets.

36:40.708 --> 36:42.207
I told her that I wanna buy

36:42.208 --> 36:43.542
and build a house,

36:43.583 --> 36:45.041
she's like, "don't do it."

36:45.042 --> 36:46.541
- Why is she saying that for?

36:46.542 --> 36:47.707
- Huh?

36:47.708 --> 36:49.375
- Why is she saying that for?
- I don't know.

36:49.378 --> 36:50.833
- What irritates me
- is how she's supposed

36:50.875 --> 36:52.375
to be my biggest supporter,

36:52.417 --> 36:53.792
"oh Adam, I got your back,

36:53.833 --> 36:55.042
- I got your back,"
- and now she's throwing shade

36:55.045 --> 36:56.875
- and telling you not to go ahead
- and buy a house with me

36:56.878 --> 36:58.083
- if you and I do decide
- to buy a house?

36:58.086 --> 36:59.667
- I know, what's up with that?

36:59.708 --> 37:01.708
I don't wanna be lying to Adam

37:01.750 --> 37:02.750
but I mean,

37:02.751 --> 37:04.000
this was a time

37:04.001 --> 37:05.249
when a lie was warranted

37:05.250 --> 37:07.042
because of mj's big mouth.

37:07.083 --> 37:08.582
- She's already been drinking,

37:08.583 --> 37:09.750
- she's probably not
- gonna remember anything

37:09.753 --> 37:11.167
she said tomorrow anyway.

37:11.208 --> 37:12.333
- Once the wedding happens,

37:12.375 --> 37:13.583
- then I can tell him
- we were talking

37:13.625 --> 37:14.916
about the secret wedding

37:14.917 --> 37:16.333
and he'll still be angry

37:16.375 --> 37:18.583
but he won't be angry at her

37:18.625 --> 37:19.750
for not wanting to buy

37:19.792 --> 37:20.875
a house with me,

37:20.917 --> 37:22.208
he'll be angry with her

37:22.250 --> 37:23.584
for sh... ting

37:23.585 --> 37:24.916
on my surprise wedding idea.

37:24.917 --> 37:27.917
- [Speaking farsi]

37:32.875 --> 37:34.875
- No.
- Don't go through with what?

37:34.917 --> 37:36.837
- Now he's over there
- giving her a de-briefing.

37:38.458 --> 37:41.791
- [Speaking farsi]

37:41.792 --> 37:43.417
- Okay, no problem.

37:43.458 --> 37:44.792
- I just... I don't
- always feel like Reza

37:44.795 --> 37:45.959
has my back and that's what

37:45.960 --> 37:47.125
really irritates me.

37:47.167 --> 37:48.792
- It's not my fault
- that's my personality.

37:48.833 --> 37:50.625
- Okay, no problem.
- Wait, shh.

37:50.628 --> 37:52.625
- Can we... we're gonna
- take this up at another time.

37:52.628 --> 37:53.750
- Please.
- Yes.

37:55.125 --> 37:56.542
- Babe.
- Hmm?

37:56.583 --> 37:57.957
- [Speaking farsi]

37:57.958 --> 37:58.958
He knows you're over there

37:59.000 --> 38:00.250
talking about him.

38:01.333 --> 38:02.542
- Yeah, I'm over here
- watching you,

38:02.583 --> 38:04.292
- I hear you, I'm not deaf.
- Yeah.

38:04.295 --> 38:05.792
- And it's [Inaudible]
- so I was checking her.

38:05.833 --> 38:07.125
- That's right.
- I just wanted to check her,

38:07.167 --> 38:08.457
that's all.

38:08.458 --> 38:09.875
Mj is butthurt.

38:09.917 --> 38:11.292
- Do you wanna go
- chill inside real quick?

38:11.295 --> 38:12.917
- Yeah.
- She's hurt

38:12.958 --> 38:14.792
- that she wasn't
- the first one told,

38:14.833 --> 38:15.917
period.

38:15.958 --> 38:17.124
- Hey guys.

38:17.125 --> 38:18.457
You guys, come hither,

38:18.458 --> 38:20.125
- please, por favor.
- Come hither.

38:20.167 --> 38:21.167
- I just want you guys

38:21.168 --> 38:23.500
to be in the loop.

38:23.542 --> 38:24.832
Reza wants to surprise Adam

38:24.833 --> 38:25.999
with a wedding.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.958
- Really?
- Mm.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.167
- Understate your response

38:29.208 --> 38:30.417
because I don't want him

38:30.418 --> 38:31.625
to know.

38:31.667 --> 38:33.167
- Well, I...
- It's gonna be a surprise.

38:33.170 --> 38:34.333
- Mj,

38:34.375 --> 38:36.000
- number one
- f... ing cardinal rule,

38:36.042 --> 38:38.000
do not break

38:38.042 --> 38:39.792
f... ing secrets.

38:39.833 --> 38:40.833
If it's a secret,

38:40.834 --> 38:42.583
that means no one should know.

38:42.625 --> 38:43.666
Shh,

38:43.667 --> 38:46.625
it's a f... ing secret.

38:46.667 --> 38:47.667
- I don't know why Reza's

38:47.668 --> 38:48.667
even engaging her

38:48.668 --> 38:50.332
in that whole conversation.

38:50.333 --> 38:51.333
- We all know like,

38:51.334 --> 38:52.333
we take what mj says

38:52.334 --> 38:54.166
with a huge grain of salt.

38:54.167 --> 38:55.167
- Don't let it bother you.
- I don't know why

38:55.208 --> 38:56.666
she thinks she's so slick.

38:56.667 --> 38:57.832
- She ain't slick.

38:57.833 --> 38:59.417
- You know, I can't trust
- that bitch.

38:59.458 --> 39:01.125
- Well, then just don't.

39:01.167 --> 39:02.292
Let it go.

39:03.875 --> 39:05.208
- Can I use
- this opportunity real quick,

39:05.209 --> 39:06.208
while nobody else is around?

39:06.250 --> 39:07.333
- Yeah, yes.
- Is there gonna be

39:07.375 --> 39:08.375
a surprise wedding?

39:08.376 --> 39:09.667
- No, I don't have it.
- No.

39:09.708 --> 39:11.000
- That's what mj said.

39:12.208 --> 39:13.292
- Oops.

39:13.333 --> 39:14.375
- Merce.
- What?

39:14.378 --> 39:16.042
- A surprise wedding.

39:16.083 --> 39:17.958
- No, I said don't say anything

39:18.000 --> 39:19.292
- in front of Adam.
- You and Mercedes?

39:19.333 --> 39:20.708
- Yeah, he's not here,
- that's why I'm saying it now.

39:20.750 --> 39:21.833
- You're having
- a surprise wedding with Adam?

39:21.875 --> 39:23.042
- No.
- No.

39:23.045 --> 39:24.084
He could've said,

39:24.085 --> 39:25.125
"your mother is a whore,"

39:25.167 --> 39:26.667
and I would've been

39:26.668 --> 39:28.167
less alarmed.

39:28.208 --> 39:29.542
If I wanted sherv to know,

39:29.583 --> 39:31.500
I would've told sherv myself.

39:31.542 --> 39:33.021
Clearly, mj's been talking

39:33.022 --> 39:34.500
to sherv.

39:34.542 --> 39:35.874
- Dude, I cancelled a wedding,

39:35.875 --> 39:37.500
- why would I have
- a surprise wedding?

39:40.875 --> 39:42.167
I don't need you

39:42.208 --> 39:43.458
throwing a wrench

39:43.500 --> 39:45.167
into this beautiful plan.

39:45.208 --> 39:46.750
Like, is that too much

39:46.792 --> 39:48.000
to want from one

39:48.001 --> 39:49.208
of your closest,

39:49.250 --> 39:50.417
oldest friends?

39:57.042 --> 39:58.250
- Dude, I cancelled a wedding,

39:58.292 --> 39:59.875
- why would I have
- a surprise wedding?

40:01.125 --> 40:02.749
- Guys, real quick,

40:02.750 --> 40:05.042
I really... I wanna say one thing.

40:05.083 --> 40:06.208
Enough.

40:09.750 --> 40:11.583
- [Speaking farsi]
- [Speaking farsi]

40:11.586 --> 40:14.082
Shabbat is the Jew's sabbath.

40:14.083 --> 40:15.249
I invited these people to come

40:15.250 --> 40:16.542
so I could break bread with them

40:16.583 --> 40:18.542
and enjoy each other's company,

40:18.583 --> 40:20.375
- so we can get to the spiritual
- part of the evening.

40:20.417 --> 40:21.417
Enough is enough,

40:21.458 --> 40:22.916
let's move past this bullsh...

40:22.917 --> 40:24.417
- And get on with why
- we're really here.

40:24.420 --> 40:25.542
Before I say the prayer,

40:25.583 --> 40:27.417
I wanted to thank,

40:27.458 --> 40:28.625
first and foremost, Jessica,

40:28.667 --> 40:30.292
for this amazing evening.

40:30.333 --> 40:31.458
Regardless of what's happened

40:31.500 --> 40:32.958
- in the last year
- with our friendship

40:33.000 --> 40:34.875
and the trials and tribulations,

40:34.917 --> 40:36.292
- we're back together
- as a family again

40:36.295 --> 40:37.457
and that means a lot to me

40:37.458 --> 40:39.083
and it means a lot to Jessica,

40:39.125 --> 40:40.792
- and I know it means
- a lot to you guys, too.

40:40.795 --> 40:42.375
- So...
- Absolutely.

40:42.417 --> 40:43.605
- Me and Jessica

40:43.606 --> 40:44.792
love you guys very much.

40:44.833 --> 40:45.917
Thank you for, you know,

40:45.958 --> 40:46.958
- sharing this spiritual night
- with us.

40:46.961 --> 40:48.000
I love you.

40:48.001 --> 40:49.042
- I love you.

40:49.083 --> 40:52.083
- [Speaking Hebrew]

40:53.125 --> 40:54.125
- Amen.
- Amen.

40:54.167 --> 40:55.292
- To you guys.

40:55.333 --> 40:57.083
- I want to build a home

40:57.125 --> 40:58.458
with my wife

40:58.500 --> 40:59.750
and this is part of the sh...

40:59.792 --> 41:00.792
A married man does.

41:00.793 --> 41:02.042
You have people over for dinner.

41:02.083 --> 41:03.146
[Speaking Hebrew]

41:03.147 --> 41:04.208
- [Speaking Hebrew]

41:04.250 --> 41:05.291
- You don't need to be drinking

41:05.292 --> 41:07.167

- and getting crazy anymore

41:07.170 --> 41:09.332
and I think I'm ready for that.

41:09.333 --> 41:10.583
- [Speaking Hebrew ]
- [Speaking Hebrew ]

41:10.625 --> 41:12.000
- Amen.
- Amen.

41:12.003 --> 41:14.666
The beauty of being persian

41:14.667 --> 41:16.583
and living in the United States

41:16.625 --> 41:19.332
is that I can be half-Jewish,

41:19.333 --> 41:20.499
half-Muslim.

41:20.500 --> 41:21.832
Mike is Jewish

41:21.833 --> 41:23.332
and his wife is too,

41:23.333 --> 41:24.583
and the rest of the table,

41:24.625 --> 41:25.666
they're all Muslim.

41:25.667 --> 41:27.292
And we're celebrating

41:27.333 --> 41:28.792
- something that's
- really beautiful.

41:28.833 --> 41:30.292
If we were back home,

41:30.333 --> 41:31.417
you know,

41:31.458 --> 41:33.138
- this would not be
- going down like this,

41:33.167 --> 41:35.167
I can tell you that.

41:35.208 --> 41:36.333
- I love you.
- Mike.

41:36.336 --> 41:37.458
- I love you.
- Thank you for having us.

41:37.500 --> 41:38.666
- Thank you.

41:38.667 --> 41:39.667
- I love a good ritual,

41:39.668 --> 41:40.668
as we all know.

41:40.708 --> 41:42.458
The symbolism of all of us

41:42.500 --> 41:44.250
being here together

41:44.292 --> 41:46.499
in love with each other

41:46.500 --> 41:48.332
just is literally

41:48.333 --> 41:49.458
making me so happy.

41:49.500 --> 41:50.541
This is exactly where we need

41:50.542 --> 41:51.708
to be right now.

41:53.208 --> 41:54.333
- Look at this tahdig
- my wife made.

41:54.375 --> 41:55.875
- Okay, people.
- Wow, that looks amazing.

41:55.878 --> 41:57.042
- Shabbat's starting.
- Yes.

41:57.083 --> 41:58.625
- Oh, yeah.
- It really warms my heart

41:58.667 --> 41:59.707
to see the progression

41:59.708 --> 42:00.708
that's happening tonight,

42:00.750 --> 42:02.333
where my wife

42:02.375 --> 42:03.458
and my friends

42:03.500 --> 42:04.688
are getting along.

42:04.689 --> 42:05.875
- Picture, selfie?

42:05.917 --> 42:07.792

- Make a face, everybody.

42:12.208 --> 42:13.625

42:13.667 --> 42:16.042

42:16.083 --> 42:17.188

42:17.189 --> 42:18.292

42:29.167 --> 42:30.207

42:30.208 --> 42:31.583
As much as you did before?

42:31.625 --> 42:33.667
- No. It's just growing pains

42:33.708 --> 42:35.416
of being a married couple.

42:35.417 --> 42:37.250
- I don't ask much.
- You ask for a lot,

42:37.292 --> 42:38.375

- No, I don't.

42:38.417 --> 42:39.417
- God help me
- for being able to put up

42:39.420 --> 42:40.916
with you the rest of my life.

42:40.917 --> 42:42.542
- We need like, some like,

42:42.583 --> 42:43.750
f... ing retreat.

42:43.792 --> 42:45.125
- Wait, so we're going camping?

42:47.250 --> 42:48.750
- F... ing motherf... er.

42:48.792 --> 42:50.417
- Golnesa can barely walk
- across the street

42:50.420 --> 42:52.042
- and she's driving
- this big-ass tin can

42:52.083 --> 42:53.083
with all of us in it.

42:53.084 --> 42:54.583
- [Inaudible]

42:54.625 --> 42:55.708
- Gg thinks she planned

42:55.750 --> 42:56.917
a little getaway for all of us

42:56.958 --> 42:58.042
to go to the woods.

42:58.083 --> 42:59.249
Little does this bitch know,

42:59.250 --> 43:01.417
we actually have a gg-vention

43:01.458 --> 43:02.916
planned around her fun

43:02.917 --> 43:04.208

43:05.583 --> 43:06.667

43:07.750 --> 43:08.917

43:08.958 --> 43:10.833
I want my tent as far away

43:10.875 --> 43:12.957
from golnesa as possible.
