00:30.489 --> 00:33.033
FABULOUS GODMOTHER:
Once upon a time...

00:35.244 --> 00:37.663
...there was
an old-fashioned kingdom

00:37.747 --> 00:39.957
bound by tradition.

00:41.751 --> 00:44.211
Here, everyone had
a part to play,

00:44.295 --> 00:47.423
and they played it
without question.

00:47.506 --> 00:49.967
Little did they know,

00:50.050 --> 00:54.180
their world was about to change.

00:56.599 --> 00:59.977
But until it did, y'all...

01:00.060 --> 01:02.271
this village
of hardworking citizens

01:02.354 --> 01:06.233
moved to the same beat
day after day,

01:06.317 --> 01:09.820
generation after generation.

01:36.931 --> 01:38.182
for a better way

01:38.265 --> 01:40.226
-

01:40.309 --> 01:43.854
of the rhythm nation

01:43.938 --> 01:48.651
the rhythm nation

01:48.734 --> 01:50.653
FABULOUS GODMOTHER:
And over here

01:50.736 --> 01:54.365
is where our story begins,
at the humble home

01:54.448 --> 01:56.909
of a practical woman
named Vivian,

01:56.992 --> 01:59.036
who was alone again

01:59.119 --> 02:02.581
after the death
of her second husband.

02:02.665 --> 02:08.420
a better way of life

02:10.381 --> 02:12.383
Vivian's daughters:

02:12.466 --> 02:16.011
the obnoxious Malvolia

02:16.095 --> 02:19.139
and the self-absorbed Narissa.

02:19.223 --> 02:20.933
She cray.

02:21.016 --> 02:25.062
-

02:25.145 --> 02:28.566
of the rhythm nation

02:28.649 --> 02:31.318
-Um, yeah.

02:31.402 --> 02:33.237
They can be a lot.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.947
I'm winning!

02:35.030 --> 02:36.991
-Whee!

02:38.742 --> 02:40.786
And down here,

02:40.870 --> 02:43.414
in this dingy basement,

02:43.497 --> 02:45.624
the stepdaughter, Ella.

02:45.708 --> 02:49.378
Or, as her stepsisters
call her, Cinderella,

02:49.461 --> 02:53.007
because her skin
was often besmirched by cinders

02:53.090 --> 02:55.885
and her stepsisters
were not that clever.

02:55.968 --> 02:58.554
Right now,
she's dreaming of a world

02:58.637 --> 03:02.266
in which she can live her life
any way she wants.

03:02.349 --> 03:05.019
Uh, watch it now. You about
to roll over on that...

03:05.102 --> 03:07.104
-...pin.

03:09.273 --> 03:11.233
the future holds

03:11.317 --> 03:15.529
your head up to the sky

03:15.613 --> 03:17.740
cause you tears

03:21.911 --> 03:23.871
unless you try

03:23.954 --> 03:25.706
you gotta be bad

03:25.789 --> 03:28.918
you gotta be wiser

03:29.001 --> 03:31.420
you gotta be tough

03:33.505 --> 03:35.925
you gotta be calm

03:45.851 --> 03:49.730
We are a part
of the rhythm nation

03:51.857 --> 03:54.360
-

03:54.443 --> 03:57.613
if you can't stand the pace

03:57.696 --> 03:59.990
-

04:03.285 --> 04:07.998
staring you in the face

04:11.710 --> 04:14.004
you gotta be bold

04:16.256 --> 04:18.676
you gotta be tough

04:20.260 --> 04:22.721
you gotta be calm

04:35.025 --> 04:36.610
-Smashed it!
-Perfectamundo.

04:36.694 --> 04:39.154
Take that, birds.

04:39.238 --> 04:41.198
Good morning,
my beady-eyed friends.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.950
You hungry?

04:43.033 --> 04:44.201
-Oh, yeah.
-Nod your head, mates.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.412
-All she hears is squeaks.
-Mm. Come to papa.

04:46.495 --> 04:47.746
- Ooh.

04:50.165 --> 04:52.418
you gotta be bold

04:52.501 --> 04:54.545
gotta be wiser

04:54.628 --> 04:56.839
you gotta be tough

04:56.922 --> 04:58.716
gotta be stronger

04:58.799 --> 05:01.385
you gotta be calm

05:01.468 --> 05:03.137
keep it together

05:10.811 --> 05:13.147
-

05:13.230 --> 05:15.190
a better way of life?

05:15.274 --> 05:17.151
-

05:17.234 --> 05:19.278
the rhythm nation

05:19.361 --> 05:20.988
-

05:21.071 --> 05:22.865
are we looking for

05:28.203 --> 05:29.955
-

05:31.623 --> 05:33.125
-

05:33.208 --> 05:34.835
-

05:34.918 --> 05:36.879
-

05:36.962 --> 05:39.214
are we looking for

05:39.298 --> 05:41.133
-

05:41.216 --> 05:45.971
of the rhythm nation

05:50.392 --> 05:55.939
all I know is love

06:15.084 --> 06:17.961
Unhappy with the tea,
Stepmother?

06:18.045 --> 06:21.590
Imagine if you served such swill
to your future husband.

06:21.673 --> 06:23.842
How long would it take
for him to abandon you?

06:23.926 --> 06:26.804
To understand
just how worthless you are?

06:26.887 --> 06:29.056
Learn from this
and never do it again.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.433
I thought she was
rather hard on her.

06:31.517 --> 06:34.228
-I thought she could've
gone harder. -Quiet.

06:34.311 --> 06:36.647
Cinderella, now that
you're an orphan,

06:36.730 --> 06:38.857
it's important for you
to remember that

06:38.941 --> 06:41.276
it's only my love for
your father-- rest his soul--

06:41.360 --> 06:43.278
that stands between you
and a life on the street.

06:43.362 --> 06:46.615
Yes, of course. And that's why
I'm so thankful for...

06:46.698 --> 06:48.408
You could be so pretty...

06:48.492 --> 06:50.828
if you took even a second
to comb that hair of yours.

06:58.669 --> 07:01.171
Oh, you're in.
Good morning, Ella.

07:01.255 --> 07:03.173
Mr. Cecil.

07:03.257 --> 07:04.424
It's Mr. Cecil!

07:05.801 --> 07:07.886
I'm curious--
do you really need that cane?

07:07.970 --> 07:09.930
No, but chicks dig it.

07:10.013 --> 07:11.140
-Oh.
-THOMAS: Vivian.

07:11.223 --> 07:12.307
Thomas.

07:12.391 --> 07:13.559
And all the girls.

07:13.642 --> 07:14.935
Lucky Thomas.

07:15.018 --> 07:16.436
-There they go.

07:16.520 --> 07:17.729
Freshly picked from the farm.

07:17.813 --> 07:21.275
Parsnips, turnips, rutabagas.

07:21.358 --> 07:23.610
The fleshiest fruit
of the earth.

07:23.694 --> 07:25.404
Would you like to come in?

07:25.487 --> 07:28.240
Yes... N-No.

07:28.323 --> 07:31.326
No, no, not today. Yeah, I just
wanted to check in on you

07:31.410 --> 07:34.288
and make sure that your, uh,
blossoming daughters

07:34.371 --> 07:36.206
are, uh...

07:36.290 --> 07:38.125
um, managing.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.376
Makes my skin crawl.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.752
-Mine, too.
-I'm into it.

07:40.836 --> 07:41.920
All right, then.

07:42.004 --> 07:43.922
Now I've got this mental image

07:44.006 --> 07:46.884
to nourish me through the day,
I'll be going.

07:50.262 --> 07:51.388
CINDERELLA:
Ew.

07:55.184 --> 07:57.936
Fortune has smiled
upon this house.

07:58.937 --> 08:00.647
My daughters have a suitor.

08:00.731 --> 08:02.316
You mean this daughter
has a suitor.

08:02.399 --> 08:03.859
The others have
heartache and jealousy.

08:03.942 --> 08:05.360
Oh, ha-ha-ha.

08:05.444 --> 08:08.405
Yeah, no, I am not
a match for Thomas.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.241
Well, you must make yourself
a match for someone.

08:11.325 --> 08:13.243
Yes.

08:13.327 --> 08:15.370
I understand, Stepmother.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.459
Here comes our girl.

08:20.542 --> 08:21.835
Oh, boy, she's got heavy feet.

08:30.552 --> 08:32.471
JAMES:
Oh, I slept in that fabric.

08:32.554 --> 08:34.181
JOHN:
Shh!

08:47.110 --> 08:48.904
a world outside

08:56.870 --> 08:59.581
that understands

08:59.665 --> 09:01.541
the whispers

09:01.625 --> 09:03.919
you're walking in

09:09.174 --> 09:12.386
staring at me

09:12.469 --> 09:15.055
I know who I'm gonna be

09:16.848 --> 09:21.061
it's gonna wake up and see

09:21.144 --> 09:22.688
-Ooh.
-Ooh, nice.

09:29.194 --> 09:33.699
a shot in the dark

09:35.659 --> 09:39.913
to be wrong

09:46.336 --> 09:50.215
know my name

09:54.219 --> 09:56.054
is always racing

09:56.138 --> 09:58.432
round the room

10:00.350 --> 10:03.729
I don't wanna do

10:03.812 --> 10:06.732
staring at me

10:06.815 --> 10:09.776
I know who I'm gonna be

10:24.207 --> 10:27.544
a shot in the dark

10:27.627 --> 10:30.130
-

10:30.213 --> 10:32.966
-Oh!

10:40.724 --> 10:43.894
know my name

10:43.977 --> 10:49.066
now and then

10:50.567 --> 10:54.738
that I could be

10:58.825 --> 11:02.704
all along in her head

11:02.788 --> 11:08.085
is hard to see

11:18.220 --> 11:22.974
a shot in the dark

11:27.646 --> 11:29.439
-

11:29.523 --> 11:32.526
-

11:35.612 --> 11:38.615
-

11:41.451 --> 11:44.329
know my name, yeah

11:47.791 --> 11:51.420
know my name.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.732
God.

12:12.816 --> 12:14.734
That's disgusting.

12:15.694 --> 12:17.696
Well, thank you for coming in.

12:17.779 --> 12:20.282
Well, before your aide-de-camp
loses a hand...

12:20.365 --> 12:25.036
This is called a world map.

12:25.120 --> 12:28.498
Now, take a look
at this blob here and here.

12:28.582 --> 12:32.544
If we marry,
our blobs would join up,

12:32.627 --> 12:35.338
and we would control the world

12:35.422 --> 12:37.966
all the way
to this huge sea monster.

12:38.049 --> 12:39.009
Mm, the sea monster.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.260
You know, I really just

12:40.343 --> 12:41.845
don't have the time
in my schedule

12:41.928 --> 12:43.555
to be controlling
these far-off lands.

12:43.638 --> 12:45.765
I am just too busy.

12:45.849 --> 12:47.184
LAURA:
Doing what?

12:47.267 --> 12:50.187
You spent three whole days
drinking and foxhunting.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.480
That was a lot of hard work.

12:51.563 --> 12:53.064
Now, you try tracking a fox
when drunk.

12:53.148 --> 12:55.066
-It's impossible.
-No, it isn't!

12:56.109 --> 12:57.486
You didn't.

12:57.569 --> 12:59.237
-Do not hit me, sweet prince!
-

12:59.321 --> 13:01.031
No, no, no, no!

13:02.741 --> 13:04.534
I promise, milord,

13:04.618 --> 13:08.163
you can keep gallivanting here
with your merry bros,

13:08.246 --> 13:10.457
and I'll have other interests.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.709
We never have to be together,
except for royal events,

13:12.792 --> 13:14.961
war planning
and when we have to engage

13:15.045 --> 13:17.005
in the disgusting practice
of making a son.

13:17.088 --> 13:18.673
WILBUR:
Yeah?

13:18.757 --> 13:20.509
Your offer is intriguing,

13:20.592 --> 13:24.513
but I have no intention
on settling down anytime soon.

13:27.557 --> 13:28.767
I see.

13:31.770 --> 13:34.439
He's not working
with much upstairs,

13:34.523 --> 13:36.399
and I'd be surprised
if it was different elsewhere.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.360
-She knows what I'm
talking about. -

13:48.828 --> 13:51.414
yeah, I took over from Barry

13:51.498 --> 13:53.625
but he died of dysentery

13:53.708 --> 13:56.545
the announcements of the day

13:56.628 --> 13:59.256
you like the way they play

13:59.339 --> 14:01.299
for you ladies and gents

14:01.383 --> 14:03.969
is soon gonna commence

14:04.052 --> 14:06.429
better than the shire fair

14:06.513 --> 14:08.974
royal family will be there

14:09.057 --> 14:11.935
-

14:12.018 --> 14:13.937
and our Queen Beatrice

14:14.020 --> 14:16.523
you don't wanna miss

14:16.606 --> 14:19.067
Princess Gwen, no doubt

14:19.150 --> 14:21.820
and the old roll out

14:28.076 --> 14:29.411
Are they rosy yet?

14:29.494 --> 14:30.996
The pain is quite terrific.

14:31.079 --> 14:33.707
-Ladies, are we ready?

14:33.790 --> 14:35.500
What in God's name
are you doing?

14:35.584 --> 14:37.210
Bringing color to her cheeks.

14:37.294 --> 14:38.920
-Good idea.

14:39.004 --> 14:41.214
-Where's Cinderella?
-She's still in that basement.

14:41.298 --> 14:44.342
-Cinderella! -I'm starting
to think she doesn't like us.

14:44.426 --> 14:46.219
Cinderella!
Girls, can you help me?

14:46.303 --> 14:48.096
ALL:
Cinderella!

14:49.514 --> 14:51.766
STEPSISTERS
Cinderella!

14:54.269 --> 14:57.480
-VIVIAN: Cinderella!
-STEPSISTERS: Cinderella!

14:59.482 --> 15:00.442
You called?

15:00.525 --> 15:01.651
Yes, stepchild.

15:01.735 --> 15:02.861
Don't be dense.

15:02.944 --> 15:04.154
I'm sorry, I-I was just...

15:04.237 --> 15:05.322
About to make an excuse?

15:05.405 --> 15:06.740
I could truly care less.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.117
Grab your things.
Try not to make us late.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.161
The changing of the guard
waits for no one.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.370
Cinderella?

15:12.454 --> 15:13.872
Yeah?

15:13.955 --> 15:15.874
Do you think I look pretty?

15:15.957 --> 15:19.210
I think you look so pretty.

15:19.294 --> 15:21.212
But...

15:21.296 --> 15:23.923
honestly, who cares
what I think?

15:24.007 --> 15:25.925
Who cares what anyone thinks?

15:26.009 --> 15:28.637
What matters is how you feel
when you look in the mirror.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.305
That's deep.

15:30.388 --> 15:33.391
How do I feel...

15:33.475 --> 15:35.477
about myself?

15:36.603 --> 15:38.188
Uh...

15:42.692 --> 15:44.027
Yeah, I do.

15:44.110 --> 15:45.654
I feel pretty.

15:45.737 --> 15:47.364
Cool.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.284
You have dirt on your face.

15:55.538 --> 15:58.124
Please, girls,
we're going to be late.

15:58.208 --> 15:59.542
What is that?

16:00.585 --> 16:02.253
It's a dress.

16:02.337 --> 16:03.546
I made it.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.006
-Why?
-I don't know.

16:05.090 --> 16:06.257
I-I just thought,

16:06.341 --> 16:07.967
since the whole kingdom
will be there today,

16:08.051 --> 16:11.763
I could find someone
who will maybe buy it.

16:17.519 --> 16:19.396
To think that any girl,
let alone you,

16:19.479 --> 16:21.606
would have the audacity
to engage

16:21.690 --> 16:23.983
in matters of business,
it's insane.

16:24.067 --> 16:26.778
I will not have you
embarrassing this household

16:26.861 --> 16:28.655
with your blasphemy.

16:28.738 --> 16:30.824
Don't ever let me catch you
trying such nonsense again.

16:32.367 --> 16:34.411
Put the dress down.

16:35.453 --> 16:36.454
Yes, Stepmother.

16:41.126 --> 16:42.585
Good.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.213
Now... shoulders back.

16:45.296 --> 16:46.715
-No slouching.

16:47.757 --> 16:49.634
And smile.

16:49.718 --> 16:52.387
Every girl is worth more
when she smiles.

17:21.082 --> 17:23.251
What are you doing?

17:23.334 --> 17:27.672
I am stewing in my own anger.

17:27.756 --> 17:28.673
Oh, okay.

17:28.757 --> 17:30.508
You turned down the daughter

17:30.592 --> 17:31.926
of Lord Reginald.

17:32.010 --> 17:33.219
I guess she wasn't the one.

17:33.303 --> 17:34.637
She was!

17:34.721 --> 17:37.348
I would've had control
of all the territories

17:37.432 --> 17:39.517
right up to the domain
of the sea monster.

17:39.601 --> 17:41.728
Well, perhaps you should marry
the sea monster, Robert.

17:41.811 --> 17:43.396
I would have to have
grandmother's ring resized.

17:44.522 --> 17:46.357
You keep overlooking
his behavior,

17:46.441 --> 17:48.359
-and he'll never grow out of it.
-Stop.

17:48.443 --> 17:49.944
He's gonna make a fine king.

17:51.654 --> 17:53.281
Is it me,

17:53.364 --> 17:57.202
or is your throne
just a little bit taller

17:57.285 --> 17:58.620
-than it was yesterday?
-

17:58.703 --> 18:00.955
-I mean, it really looks...
-Oh, don't be ridiculous.

18:01.039 --> 18:02.165
-Quite a bit.
-And even if it is,

18:02.248 --> 18:04.459
I have every right
to make it taller.

18:04.542 --> 18:05.585
I'm king.

18:05.668 --> 18:08.046
Mm. Yes.

18:09.339 --> 18:10.757
And I am ridiculous.

18:10.840 --> 18:14.052
If you need me,
I shall be in my chambers.

18:14.135 --> 18:15.887
Brushing my hair.

18:15.970 --> 18:17.764
Until it all falls out.

18:17.847 --> 18:20.183
So we good?
'Cause I got a thing.

18:20.266 --> 18:22.352
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.104
You're bringing shame
on this family, Robert.

18:25.188 --> 18:27.190
Have you seen this?

18:27.273 --> 18:29.734
ROBERT: "The Roundabout Players
present The King's Idiot Son."

18:29.818 --> 18:31.569
Ooh, do you think
we can still get tickets?

18:31.653 --> 18:33.029
I'm becoming a laughingstock.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.614
I think you're overreacting.

18:34.697 --> 18:36.282
Well, why don't you ask
the Roundabout Players

18:36.366 --> 18:37.534
if I'm overreacting?

18:37.617 --> 18:39.160
They are currently

18:39.244 --> 18:41.788
in a dark windowless room
under the castle.

18:43.248 --> 18:45.917
You can't leave actors alone
in a basement without attention.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.001
They'll die!

18:47.085 --> 18:48.545
When you marry,
you'll settle down.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.630
You'll stop behaving
like my idiot son,

18:50.713 --> 18:52.298
and the perception
of the people will be

18:52.382 --> 18:54.175
that you take the crown
seriously.

18:54.259 --> 18:55.468
-You can't control me.
-

18:55.552 --> 18:56.886
Oh, that's exactly
what I can do.

18:56.970 --> 18:58.346
That's the perk
of being the king.

18:58.429 --> 18:59.722
But I feel nothing
for these women.

18:59.806 --> 19:00.890
It's crazy to think
I'm actually gonna

19:00.974 --> 19:01.975
fall in love with one of them.

19:02.058 --> 19:03.226
Kings marry for power,

19:03.309 --> 19:04.602
-not for love.
-

19:04.686 --> 19:06.229
Oh, well, it's perfect then
that Mother came with

19:06.312 --> 19:08.231
three castles
and a hundred horses,

19:08.314 --> 19:09.399
or I suppose
I never would've been born!

19:09.482 --> 19:11.109
-Silence!
-

19:19.242 --> 19:22.745
Don't talk about
what you don't understand. Hmm?

19:22.829 --> 19:27.000
Continue to defy me,
and just out of spite,

19:27.083 --> 19:31.087
I'll give it all-- the crown,

19:31.170 --> 19:33.006
the palace,

19:33.089 --> 19:36.092
everything-- to your sister.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.136
CHOIR:

19:38.219 --> 19:40.013
Leave us, Gwen.

19:46.352 --> 19:47.312
Sorry.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.022
I would be embarrassed

19:49.105 --> 19:52.400
if I wasn't so bored
with my life.

19:52.483 --> 19:55.278
But since I'm here,
I would love to stay

19:55.361 --> 19:57.113
and help sort out
this whole crown issue.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.656
You've been excused, Gwen.

19:58.740 --> 20:00.909
Right.

20:00.992 --> 20:03.786
But would this be a good time
for me to mention

20:03.870 --> 20:06.205
how the kingdom could use
the power of the wind

20:06.289 --> 20:07.874
-instead of burning
filthy coal? -Go!

20:11.085 --> 20:14.255
Father, you know how badly
I want to be king.

20:15.882 --> 20:18.051
Now, to make sure your nuptials

20:18.134 --> 20:21.179
are done properly and on my
schedule, we shall hold a ball.

20:21.262 --> 20:22.680
-No.

20:24.307 --> 20:26.476
Yes. We'll invite
every woman of worth.

20:26.559 --> 20:29.312
You'll dance.
You'll be charming.

20:29.395 --> 20:30.772
You shall find a bride.

20:30.855 --> 20:32.023
-Hmm?
-No, no, no.

20:32.106 --> 20:34.442
D-Dancing at these things
is so... mannered.

20:34.525 --> 20:35.443
And formal.

20:35.526 --> 20:36.736
We look like fools!

20:36.819 --> 20:38.029
Of course we do.

20:38.112 --> 20:39.447
But women love it.

20:39.530 --> 20:42.116
Good God, Robert,
if a rich man ever lost a woman,

20:42.200 --> 20:43.910
it was to a man who could dance.

20:43.993 --> 20:46.955
Why do I have to explain
everything to you?

20:47.038 --> 20:48.081
This is insane!

20:48.164 --> 20:49.916
I can't just pick
some bride at a ball.

20:49.999 --> 20:51.334
And then what?

20:51.417 --> 20:53.795
We're-we're supposed
to grow old together?

20:53.878 --> 20:55.338
Into our 40s?

20:55.421 --> 20:58.174
I mean, what are we even
gonna talk about?

20:58.257 --> 20:59.968
You will go to the ball.

21:00.051 --> 21:02.720
You will find someone.

21:02.804 --> 21:04.055
That's an order.

21:05.390 --> 21:07.475
Now, go dress.

21:07.558 --> 21:10.812
I expect you to look sharp for
the changing of the guard. Hmm?

21:14.357 --> 21:15.358
Nothing?

21:16.401 --> 21:18.653
-

21:19.654 --> 21:20.738
Don't be late.

21:20.822 --> 21:22.740
"Don't be late."

21:26.369 --> 21:27.286
Well?

21:27.370 --> 21:29.872
You heard the king.

22:00.403 --> 22:03.406
Each morning I get up,
I die a little

22:03.489 --> 22:05.199
-

22:06.784 --> 22:09.912
in the mirror and cry

22:09.996 --> 22:12.040
Lord,
what you're doing to me

22:12.123 --> 22:14.292
-

22:16.044 --> 22:18.921
get no relief

22:23.217 --> 22:26.554
-

22:36.898 --> 22:38.441
-

22:40.401 --> 22:42.737
in my bones

22:42.820 --> 22:46.240
-

22:46.324 --> 22:49.410
-

22:49.494 --> 22:51.245
-

22:51.329 --> 22:52.705
-

22:52.789 --> 22:56.084
from my eyes, Lord

22:56.167 --> 22:58.753
-

23:04.342 --> 23:09.013
-

23:11.099 --> 23:12.517
-

23:12.600 --> 23:14.519
-

23:14.602 --> 23:17.563
-

23:17.647 --> 23:21.359
to put me down

23:21.442 --> 23:24.612
-

23:24.695 --> 23:26.989
of water in my brain

23:49.262 --> 23:52.056
to love

23:52.140 --> 23:53.766
-

23:53.850 --> 23:55.351
-

23:55.434 --> 23:56.853
-

23:56.936 --> 23:58.271
-

23:58.354 --> 24:00.106
-

24:00.189 --> 24:01.566
-

24:01.649 --> 24:03.234
-

24:03.317 --> 24:04.610
-

24:04.694 --> 24:06.487
-

24:06.571 --> 24:08.239
-

24:08.322 --> 24:10.783
-

24:10.867 --> 24:13.953
-

24:14.036 --> 24:15.538
-

24:15.621 --> 24:17.081
-Dude.
-

24:28.384 --> 24:30.553
Get off my dad!

24:30.636 --> 24:32.722
-

24:36.851 --> 24:38.686
Oh, good.

24:38.769 --> 24:41.105
Everyone's staring at me,
just as I'd hoped.

24:41.189 --> 24:44.108
I'm sorry, Your Highness!

24:44.192 --> 24:45.860
It's just really hard
to see in the back.

24:45.943 --> 24:48.905
Might I suggest you put
some bleachers back there?

24:48.988 --> 24:50.865
Give us short peasants a chance?

24:52.325 --> 24:54.368
"I hereby decree
all short peasants

24:54.452 --> 24:56.370
shall be pardoned by the king."

24:56.454 --> 24:59.457
ROWAN:
Get down now!

24:59.540 --> 25:02.335
He doesn't-- He didn't think
that was funny, did he?

25:02.418 --> 25:03.502
Oop, bird poo.

25:14.597 --> 25:16.432
-

25:16.515 --> 25:18.351
-

25:20.061 --> 25:22.438
- Excuse me, sorry.

25:45.127 --> 25:46.879
I'll play your silly game,

25:46.963 --> 25:50.216
but only if every girl in the
kingdom is invited to the ball,

25:50.299 --> 25:51.842
regardless of wealth or stature.

25:51.926 --> 25:55.805
Marrying a commoner
is not at all what I meant.

25:55.888 --> 25:57.598
Father, please.

25:57.682 --> 26:00.768
Deep down,
you need me to be king.

26:00.851 --> 26:02.979
What a black mark
it'll be on your name

26:03.062 --> 26:04.397
if I don't continue the line.

26:05.481 --> 26:06.649
So, what option
do you really have?

26:11.112 --> 26:12.905
Too subtle?

26:12.989 --> 26:14.532
Not subtle enough?

26:14.615 --> 26:16.534
Fine.

26:16.617 --> 26:18.035
So it shall be.

26:27.086 --> 26:30.881
Don't even think about it, Gwen.

26:30.965 --> 26:33.009
You're literally
not even going to let me

26:33.092 --> 26:34.677
have a seat at the table?

26:34.760 --> 26:37.096
I don't make up the rules.
I'm just the king.

26:37.179 --> 26:38.806
Right.

27:07.710 --> 27:10.046
So you're just going to
wander about until you find her,

27:10.129 --> 27:11.547
wearing that
ridiculous disguise?

27:11.630 --> 27:14.467
It works, Wilbur.

27:14.550 --> 27:15.593
Nobody recognizes me.

27:15.676 --> 27:17.178
Lucky for you.

27:17.261 --> 27:18.512
Ah, no, too much.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.098
What? The-the makeup?

27:21.182 --> 27:23.184
-No, you look like a pirate.
-You look like a pirate.

27:23.267 --> 27:25.144
Unnecessary.

27:25.227 --> 27:27.396
You know, I can't believe
that you're willing to sully

27:27.480 --> 27:30.358
the dignity of the royal family
for some commoner.

27:30.441 --> 27:31.567
Wilbur, you sound old.

27:31.650 --> 27:32.777
-I'm just...
-Just what?

27:32.860 --> 27:34.236
She's-she's beautiful.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.489
She's witty. She's fearless.

27:36.572 --> 27:38.574
I mean, holy hell, did you see
the way she talked to my father?

27:38.657 --> 27:40.368
-So mouthy.
-And glorious.

27:40.451 --> 27:41.410
I must know her.

27:41.494 --> 27:42.912
So, yes, I'm gonna
walk the streets

27:42.995 --> 27:45.706
until I find her,
reveal my true self,

27:45.790 --> 27:47.500
and then personally
invite her to the ball.

27:47.583 --> 27:49.210
Unless, of course, it turns out

27:49.293 --> 27:51.420
that she's got a couple bats
in the old belfry,

27:51.504 --> 27:54.298
in which case, I will realize
that my feelings were incorrect

27:54.382 --> 27:56.425
and...

27:56.509 --> 27:57.843
slowly back away.

27:59.261 --> 28:01.889
It is your belfry that has bats.

28:01.972 --> 28:04.100
I do not have a single bat
in my belfry.

28:04.183 --> 28:05.684
No, there are multiple bats
in your belfry.

28:05.768 --> 28:07.269
I am the prince, and I say

28:07.353 --> 28:09.063
that your belfry
is the one with the bats.

28:09.146 --> 28:10.398
Well, I'm the prince's
best friend,

28:10.481 --> 28:13.192
and I say that yours
is one with the bats.

28:15.820 --> 28:17.113
I'm your best friend, right?

28:18.781 --> 28:20.866
I have lots of friends.

28:23.744 --> 28:25.287
Of course you're my best friend.

28:25.371 --> 28:26.580
Yeah, thought so.

28:26.664 --> 28:28.416
Beautiful human.

28:29.792 --> 28:30.960
Bats.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.177
Look at that.

28:40.261 --> 28:41.720
Wow.

28:41.804 --> 28:42.763
You know, it's a good thing

28:42.847 --> 28:44.598
Stepmother never
comes down here.

28:44.682 --> 28:46.851
She does not approve of pets.

28:46.934 --> 28:48.310
Or charity.

28:48.394 --> 28:50.563
Or kindness of any sort, really.

28:52.064 --> 28:54.608
And she'd definitely
stop you from doing

28:54.692 --> 28:58.446
whatever it is you're doing
right now, which is beautiful.

28:59.780 --> 29:01.532
And only a little bit gross.

29:01.615 --> 29:02.992
A little bit? It's revolting.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.660
She needs to throw that out.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.287
-I don't mind it.
-CINDERELLA: All right.

29:09.206 --> 29:11.584
Because life
outside this basement...

29:12.835 --> 29:14.211
...starts right now.

29:16.380 --> 29:18.299
Girls, it shouldn't be so hard.

29:18.382 --> 29:19.383
But it is.

29:19.467 --> 29:20.926
Work is always hard.

29:24.972 --> 29:26.891
Why are we doing
Cinderella work?

29:26.974 --> 29:28.642
Because I want you to see what
you're in for if you don't marry

29:28.726 --> 29:30.019
a man of means, like Thomas.

29:30.102 --> 29:31.187
Thomas.

29:31.270 --> 29:32.646
He's quite the catch.

29:32.730 --> 29:34.523
Too bad he hasn't
been back in days.

29:34.607 --> 29:35.774
Well, if it's not Thomas,

29:35.858 --> 29:37.151
then it will just have to be
some other man.

29:37.234 --> 29:39.403
Like him?

29:39.487 --> 29:40.988
VIVIAN:
No.

29:41.071 --> 29:42.114
No, no, no, no, no.

29:42.198 --> 29:44.241
Do not cast your eyes
on some farm boy.

29:44.325 --> 29:47.077
In this life,
you must marry rich.

29:47.161 --> 29:50.164
Get yourself a man
who can pay for everything,

29:50.247 --> 29:52.416
and then you will never
so much as have to hang

29:52.500 --> 29:53.834
your wet undergarments again.

29:53.918 --> 29:55.669
-I'm-a go see
if he needs a wife. -No.

29:55.753 --> 29:57.129
Farm boy is off the table.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.674
No matter how toothsome
he may be, and...

30:04.303 --> 30:06.013
...and toothsome he is.

30:06.889 --> 30:08.307
Ew, what does that mean?

30:08.390 --> 30:09.975
It's how old people
say "poppin'."

30:10.059 --> 30:11.644
-Ah.
-VIVIAN: You must always think

30:11.727 --> 30:13.979
and act like this.

30:15.564 --> 30:18.859
some boys hug me

30:22.112 --> 30:26.158
proper credit

30:29.995 --> 30:31.539
-

30:31.622 --> 30:32.873
-

30:37.127 --> 30:39.296
with the cold, hard cash

30:43.342 --> 30:46.887
in a material world

30:52.643 --> 30:54.061
-

30:57.022 --> 30:59.024
But what about romance?

30:59.108 --> 31:00.192
Oh, please.

31:02.111 --> 31:03.195
Listen up.

31:10.244 --> 31:12.788
raise my interest

31:12.871 --> 31:17.084
-

31:17.167 --> 31:19.253
-

31:21.005 --> 31:24.091
-

31:24.174 --> 31:28.095
who save their pennies

31:30.639 --> 31:34.059
in a material world

31:38.230 --> 31:39.523
-Get it?
-Yes!

31:39.607 --> 31:43.777
in a material world

31:46.322 --> 31:50.659
in a material world

31:54.330 --> 31:57.207
in a material world

31:57.291 --> 32:00.085
-

32:00.169 --> 32:01.462
-

32:03.922 --> 32:06.800
-

32:26.278 --> 32:27.821
CINDERELLA:
"And Sons."

32:29.615 --> 32:31.283
"Y Hermanos."

32:31.367 --> 32:33.327
"And Sons."

32:45.964 --> 32:49.343
-Lovely day for a stroll.
-Mm-hmm.

32:49.426 --> 32:51.178
I just adore your headpiece.

32:51.261 --> 32:53.681
You know, it'd go beautifully
with this dress I made.

32:53.764 --> 32:55.933
-I can give you a fair price.
-Shame on you.

32:56.016 --> 32:58.060
Trying to sell me a dress
you clearly stole

32:58.143 --> 32:59.478
from the lady you serve.

32:59.561 --> 33:01.939
No, I-I stitched this
with my own two hands.

33:02.022 --> 33:04.441
I should alert the king's guard
and have you arrested,

33:04.525 --> 33:05.734
you street urchin.

33:05.818 --> 33:07.861
Arrest--?

33:11.407 --> 33:13.075
Okay.

33:15.577 --> 33:17.705
CINDERELLA:
Ladies and gentlemen!

33:17.788 --> 33:20.749
For a mere
five pieces of silver,

33:20.833 --> 33:23.919
who would like to purchase
this one-of-a-kind,

33:24.002 --> 33:25.921
completely non-stolen dress?

33:26.004 --> 33:27.464
Here's a laugh.

33:27.548 --> 33:29.967
This girl fancies herself
a businessman.

33:33.554 --> 33:36.598
Don't-Don't listen to him.
This is a one-of-a-kind design.

33:36.682 --> 33:38.142
I'd stop while
you're ahead, missy.

33:38.225 --> 33:40.853
-Who on earth do you think
you are? -Honestly.

33:41.937 --> 33:43.063
But...

33:43.147 --> 33:44.982
Sounds like you need
to lower your price.

33:46.191 --> 33:48.068
Sir, please don't pile on, okay?

33:48.152 --> 33:49.278
Not today.

33:49.361 --> 33:50.821
No, no, I'm sorry.
It's a beautiful dress.

33:50.904 --> 33:53.115
Right?
I should be allowed to sell it.

33:53.198 --> 33:55.242
Sure, but women can't own shops.

33:55.325 --> 33:57.369
-Uh-huh. And that's unfair.
-Is it?

33:57.453 --> 33:58.871
Yes!

33:58.954 --> 34:01.206
Us ladies give birth.

34:01.290 --> 34:02.791
We run households.

34:02.875 --> 34:04.293
Surely we can run a business.

34:04.376 --> 34:05.919
Can't be that hard.

34:06.003 --> 34:08.005
I mean,
wouldn't it just be great

34:08.088 --> 34:09.465
if I could have my own shop?

34:09.548 --> 34:10.507
Right here.

34:10.591 --> 34:12.634
I could hang my garments
on that side.

34:12.718 --> 34:16.388
And I'd say things like,
"Thank you. Come again."

34:16.472 --> 34:18.390
Or, "Hot enough
out there for ya?"

34:18.474 --> 34:19.850
What?

34:19.933 --> 34:21.268
It's banter.

34:21.351 --> 34:22.478
It breaks the ice.

34:22.561 --> 34:24.062
Okay. What am I doing?
I'm going home.

34:24.146 --> 34:25.522
-I'm talking to a stranger.
-I'll take it.

34:25.606 --> 34:26.857
Take what?

34:26.940 --> 34:28.609
The dress. I'll buy it.

34:28.692 --> 34:30.652
Is this pity?

34:30.736 --> 34:32.488
Are you doing this
'cause you feel sorry for me?

34:32.571 --> 34:34.031
-Because that's really nice,
but... -No.

34:34.114 --> 34:37.701
I'm just trying to do my part
to correct a flawed system.

34:37.785 --> 34:40.412
What's your price?
I mean, the brooch alone...

34:40.496 --> 34:42.289
Oh, the brooch.

34:42.372 --> 34:43.415
That was my mother's.

34:43.499 --> 34:45.626
I never knew her,
but I want to believe

34:45.709 --> 34:49.880
she'd rather me have my dreams
than her brooch, so...

34:52.633 --> 34:54.468
I'll pay triple
what you're asking.

34:55.511 --> 34:56.678
You?

34:56.762 --> 35:00.182
Don't judge a book
by its cover, milady.

35:09.274 --> 35:10.901
there'll be a ball

35:10.984 --> 35:12.945
night could change your life

35:13.028 --> 35:14.988
finally find his wife

35:15.072 --> 35:16.198
all the single ladies

35:17.741 --> 35:19.326
to the ball is invited

35:19.409 --> 35:20.994
So take a bath,
do your hair

35:21.078 --> 35:22.704
paint your nails

35:22.788 --> 35:24.498
to impress, yes

35:28.836 --> 35:31.213
yo, uh

35:31.296 --> 35:33.549
underqualified, nah

35:35.843 --> 35:38.554
yo, uh

35:38.637 --> 35:40.347
y'all, uh

35:48.188 --> 35:51.108
Prince Robert needs a ball
to find his bride.

35:51.191 --> 35:53.026
What is wrong with him?

35:53.110 --> 35:55.195
Maybe nothing's wrong with him.

35:55.279 --> 35:56.655
I heard he just wants to allow

35:56.738 --> 35:58.282
anyone the chance
to fall in love with him.

35:58.365 --> 36:00.325
How conceited is that?

36:01.910 --> 36:04.413
Rumors must be true.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.582
What, pray tell, are the rumors?

36:06.665 --> 36:08.584
You know, that he serves
no real function

36:08.667 --> 36:10.002
other than to wreck things.

36:10.085 --> 36:13.255
That the real brains
of the family is Princess Gwen.

36:13.338 --> 36:14.298
Duh.

36:14.381 --> 36:16.049
Oh, and that he's a mama's boy

36:16.133 --> 36:17.926
who I heard, from time to time,

36:18.010 --> 36:19.511
still gets spanked
on the tush-tush.

36:19.595 --> 36:22.097
-Not true at all, though.
-Ah, maybe.

36:22.180 --> 36:23.765
Sounds like a vicious lie to me.

36:23.849 --> 36:25.934
So does this mean
you're not coming to the ball?

36:26.018 --> 36:27.185
No way.

36:27.269 --> 36:29.062
I mean, the whole thing
is weird and antiquated.

36:29.146 --> 36:30.272
Not my thing.

36:30.355 --> 36:31.857
Nice to meet you.

36:31.940 --> 36:35.819
You know, we live in
a very old-fashioned kingdom,

36:35.903 --> 36:38.238
but the ball, I mean,

36:38.322 --> 36:40.991
there'll be guests there
from all over the world,

36:41.074 --> 36:43.535
open-minded people
with cash to spare.

36:44.536 --> 36:45.871
Now, I know them.

36:45.954 --> 36:47.372
I can introduce you
if you'd like.

36:48.582 --> 36:50.167
Why would you do that?

36:50.250 --> 36:51.668
I mean, you just met me.

36:53.003 --> 36:55.380
Let's just say
I know what it feels like

36:55.464 --> 36:58.634
to not quite fit into the crate
you were born into.

36:58.717 --> 37:01.011
And I... I believe in you.

37:04.306 --> 37:06.141
Then, yes.

37:06.224 --> 37:07.225
I'll go.

37:07.309 --> 37:09.102
Huzzah!

37:09.186 --> 37:10.646
What?

37:12.272 --> 37:15.359
I heard a proper person say that
one time when he was excited.

37:15.442 --> 37:18.528
Ah, look who's been around
a proper person.

37:18.612 --> 37:19.947
Just once.

37:20.030 --> 37:21.907
I once shared an apple
with a goat named King Rowan.

37:21.990 --> 37:23.617
Well, I'm sure the prince
will definitely pick you.

37:23.700 --> 37:25.619
I doubt it. I'm dirty.

37:25.702 --> 37:27.621
I smell like a basement.

37:27.704 --> 37:29.289
My best friends are mice.
It's a whole thing.

37:29.373 --> 37:31.291
I-I will just find you
at the ball.

37:31.375 --> 37:34.461
Thank you for this.

37:34.544 --> 37:36.630
You're welcome.

37:38.006 --> 37:39.800
Hope the dress fits!

37:39.883 --> 37:41.760
Gonna try it on
as soon as I get home.

37:45.055 --> 37:46.682
He's kind of cute.

37:54.564 --> 37:57.985
Give me your
finest fabrics, please, sir.

38:01.738 --> 38:03.615
Yes!

38:12.666 --> 38:14.668
This is it.

38:16.253 --> 38:18.255
This is my chance.

38:21.091 --> 38:22.926
Hmm.

38:34.688 --> 38:38.066
from where I stay?

38:42.654 --> 38:46.867
I'll choose another way?

38:46.950 --> 38:48.744
-ROBERT:

38:48.827 --> 38:52.539
what everybody else doing

38:52.622 --> 38:56.793
what they all do

38:56.877 --> 39:01.214
how far would I grow?

39:01.298 --> 39:03.133
this road of mine

39:06.762 --> 39:08.722
we could be something

39:08.805 --> 39:10.932
-

39:11.016 --> 39:12.684
No, no, no, no,
that's wrong

39:14.811 --> 39:17.731
the things that I can't see?

39:17.814 --> 39:19.566
Ow!

39:19.649 --> 39:21.902
-

39:31.036 --> 39:33.789
that I can't see

39:49.387 --> 39:51.431
-In your dreams!
-In your face!

39:51.515 --> 39:53.892
-Girls, please!
-ROWAN: I assure you,

39:53.975 --> 39:57.229
Robert will cease
to be a distraction.

39:57.312 --> 39:59.356
hope you don't look back

40:01.316 --> 40:03.068
control your life

40:03.151 --> 40:05.570
-

40:05.654 --> 40:07.405
and don't let go

40:07.489 --> 40:09.449
compare you, no

40:09.533 --> 40:11.118
you're not alone

40:13.286 --> 40:15.914
-

40:15.997 --> 40:19.417
I'm wrong, wrong

40:19.501 --> 40:23.296
right, right

40:23.380 --> 40:27.342
I'm wrong, wrong

40:29.678 --> 40:31.888
-ROBERT:

40:31.972 --> 40:34.391
I'm wrong, wrong

40:34.474 --> 40:36.601
CINDERELLA:

40:36.685 --> 40:38.728
right, right

40:38.812 --> 40:40.897
-

40:40.981 --> 40:42.899
-

40:48.155 --> 40:49.739
Thomas.

40:49.823 --> 40:51.241
May I come in?

40:54.494 --> 40:56.746
-

40:56.830 --> 41:00.250
be something for real?

41:00.333 --> 41:01.751
yeah, yeah, oh

41:01.835 --> 41:04.796
-

41:04.880 --> 41:06.423
-Not too fast.
-

41:07.966 --> 41:10.093
yeah, yeah, oh

41:11.928 --> 41:13.722
-

41:13.805 --> 41:15.682
-

41:15.765 --> 41:18.143
-

41:20.854 --> 41:23.690
that I can't see

41:23.773 --> 41:26.443
-

41:28.904 --> 41:32.866
be something for real?

41:38.705 --> 41:43.501
the things that I can't

41:49.341 --> 41:51.509
Sorry, ma'am.

41:51.593 --> 41:54.846
NARISSA:
I feel great about myself.

41:56.514 --> 41:59.142
All right, turn around.
Let me see.

42:02.020 --> 42:03.813
Oh, my.

42:04.856 --> 42:07.651
After tonight, one of you may
very well become a princess.

42:08.944 --> 42:10.737
-You really think so?

42:10.820 --> 42:12.239
I do.

42:12.322 --> 42:14.658
And after all the bad things
that have happened in our lives,

42:14.741 --> 42:16.701
wouldn't it be nice
if we had something good?

42:26.127 --> 42:28.255
It's over. I'm eating a muffin
and going to bed.

42:28.338 --> 42:29.881
No.

42:29.965 --> 42:32.759
Did you make that dress?

42:32.842 --> 42:33.969
Mm-hmm.

42:34.052 --> 42:35.887
I suppose it's nice.

42:35.971 --> 42:37.305
It's tasteful.

42:37.389 --> 42:38.848
Thank you.

42:38.932 --> 42:41.476
I'm sorry, I should have said
something earlier,

42:41.559 --> 42:43.812
but, Cinderella, you don't need
to go to the ball.

42:44.854 --> 42:46.314
What do you mean?

42:46.398 --> 42:47.524
Of course I do.

42:47.607 --> 42:49.818
No, it's for girls
who are unbetrothed,

42:49.901 --> 42:52.696
and as of this morning,
you are spoken for.

42:53.780 --> 42:55.532
That's impossible.

42:55.615 --> 42:57.242
I speak for me.

42:57.325 --> 43:00.745
No, Thomas has expressed
his intentions to marry you.

43:00.829 --> 43:01.830
CINDERELLA:
Thomas?

43:01.913 --> 43:04.040
But I don't want
to marry Thomas.

43:04.124 --> 43:05.750
-I reject his intentions.
-Hush now.

43:05.834 --> 43:07.877
Women who are promised away
do not go to balls.

43:07.961 --> 43:10.672
Take off that dress
and go back to your basement.

43:10.755 --> 43:11.881
No, but...

43:11.965 --> 43:13.883
Please, Stepmother,
I have to go.

43:13.967 --> 43:15.343
My future depends on it.

43:15.427 --> 43:17.554
I-I spent weeks making
this dress so that I could

43:17.637 --> 43:19.472
show women from
all over the world that I...

43:23.351 --> 43:25.437
Why would you...?

43:27.188 --> 43:28.356
Ow.

43:28.440 --> 43:29.941
You are to stay home

43:30.025 --> 43:32.861
and find a way
to be that man's bride.

43:32.944 --> 43:37.449
Upset me further, and you will
have no one in this life.

43:55.967 --> 43:57.260
Poor Ella.

43:57.344 --> 43:59.012
She was so looking forward
to that ball.

43:59.095 --> 44:02.098
-It's a shame.
-Absolutely devastating.

44:08.480 --> 44:10.565
Uh, guys?

44:17.405 --> 44:18.782
Gosh, that's beautiful.

44:18.865 --> 44:20.533
What an improvement.

44:23.620 --> 44:24.954
Adventure time.
Let's follow it.

44:25.038 --> 44:26.456
Right behind you.

44:26.539 --> 44:28.249
I really shouldn't run
on a full stomach, but okay.

44:37.884 --> 44:40.512
staring at me

45:00.990 --> 45:05.245
a shot in the dark

45:07.831 --> 45:11.209
to be wrong

45:33.773 --> 45:35.817
You did it.

45:35.900 --> 45:37.694
Well done, my friend.

46:02.969 --> 46:05.805
Work! Yes!

46:05.889 --> 46:08.933
Now, this is how
you make an entrance.

46:12.020 --> 46:15.106
Allow me to introduce myself.

46:15.190 --> 46:18.359
I am your Fabulous Godmother.

46:18.443 --> 46:20.862
-But-but why?
-Baby, you saved me.

46:20.945 --> 46:24.532
And so now I'm here to save you

46:24.616 --> 46:26.701
by sending you to that ball.

46:26.784 --> 46:28.411
Well, I'm not allowed
at the ball.

46:28.495 --> 46:29.913
And, quite frankly,

46:29.996 --> 46:31.539
I think you're a figment
of my imagination.

46:31.623 --> 46:32.749
Okay, let's not ruin

46:32.832 --> 46:34.167
this incredibly magical moment
with reason.

46:34.250 --> 46:36.377
Do you want to go
to that ball and meet

46:36.461 --> 46:38.171
a bunch of rich people
who will change your life?

46:38.254 --> 46:39.380
Yes, I was just crying

46:39.464 --> 46:41.007
and singing about it
like two minutes ago.

46:41.090 --> 46:42.258
Okay, so that would be
an affirmative?

46:42.342 --> 46:43.468
Yes.

46:43.551 --> 46:44.677
I can't hear you.

46:44.761 --> 46:45.970
-Yes!
-Like you mean it.

46:46.054 --> 46:47.055
Yes!

46:47.138 --> 46:50.099
Then go you shall.

46:53.895 --> 46:55.063
-

46:55.146 --> 46:57.357
take you very far

47:03.863 --> 47:07.283
what it seems

47:07.367 --> 47:11.412
come into view

47:14.040 --> 47:15.375
-Ooh.

47:16.918 --> 47:21.923
to carry on

47:22.006 --> 47:24.926
big and strong

47:27.220 --> 47:28.763
Uh...

47:31.432 --> 47:33.518
You can't wear that to the ball.

47:33.601 --> 47:35.311
I know.

47:37.063 --> 47:39.190
Oh. Look at that.

47:39.274 --> 47:41.025
This is... this is different.

47:41.109 --> 47:42.986
-I've never seen anything
like this. -Okay, okay, dang.

47:43.069 --> 47:45.363
You said you wanted
to be a businesswoman.

47:47.907 --> 47:49.784
Think, Fab G, think.

47:55.623 --> 47:56.791
Mm.

48:04.424 --> 48:05.967
Did I miss...?

48:06.050 --> 48:09.262
Wait...

48:09.345 --> 48:10.763
for it.

48:16.894 --> 48:19.731
No, no, no, that design
is pure fantasy.

48:19.814 --> 48:21.190
I don't even know
if it's possible.

48:21.274 --> 48:24.110
Hush. It's magic time.

48:42.337 --> 48:44.589
You know, the wind is
really picking up.

48:44.672 --> 48:46.799
I feel like maybe we should
take this inside or...

49:21.834 --> 49:23.711
This is gorgeous!

49:23.795 --> 49:26.130
Yas, future queen! Yas!

49:26.214 --> 49:28.132
What's that, Prince?

49:28.216 --> 49:29.926
You'd like to dance?

49:30.009 --> 49:31.052
Ah-ah-ah.

49:31.135 --> 49:33.054
Get in line, Your Highness.

49:33.137 --> 49:34.138
Hold on.

49:36.724 --> 49:38.518
Where am I going?

49:43.106 --> 49:44.565
Wow.

49:44.649 --> 49:46.734
They're beautiful.

49:46.818 --> 49:48.736
They're glass?

49:48.820 --> 49:50.113
Any way you can make 'em
more comfortable?

49:50.196 --> 49:52.490
-No.
-But you're magic.

49:52.573 --> 49:54.075
Women's shoes are as they are.

49:54.158 --> 49:56.035
Even magic has its limits.

49:56.119 --> 49:58.329
-Oh.
-

49:58.413 --> 50:00.540
Ow.

50:00.623 --> 50:02.375
How am I gonna...?

50:02.458 --> 50:04.752
Feet don't work like this.

50:07.171 --> 50:08.840
Getting better.

50:08.923 --> 50:11.426
Oh. Oh.

50:11.509 --> 50:13.761
I'm doing it.
-Oh!

50:24.480 --> 50:25.690
a shining star

50:28.609 --> 50:30.027
-

50:33.239 --> 50:34.782
-Go on with your bad self.
-

50:34.866 --> 50:37.368
Oh, um, I don't suppose

50:37.452 --> 50:39.662
you could actually get me
to the ball, could you?

50:46.711 --> 50:48.504
-Ho...
-Ly...

50:48.588 --> 50:50.173
Fudge.

50:52.258 --> 50:54.886
You need footmen.

50:56.304 --> 50:57.472
ROMESH:
He sees us.

50:57.555 --> 50:59.140
Well, well, well.

51:00.725 --> 51:04.020
Look at you little
disgusting creatures.

51:04.103 --> 51:05.855
You will do.

51:05.938 --> 51:07.940
-JOHN: Do for what?
-ROMESH: Yeah, do for what?

51:08.024 --> 51:09.150
-ROMESH: Do for what?
-JOHN: Do for what?

51:09.233 --> 51:11.569
JAMES and JOHN:
Do for what?!

51:11.652 --> 51:13.654
-Whoa.
-JAMES: Where's my tail?

51:13.738 --> 51:15.531
I-I can't balance
without my tail.

51:15.615 --> 51:17.074
CINDERELLA:
You're boys?

51:17.158 --> 51:19.243
I always assumed you were girls.

51:19.327 --> 51:21.621
And why would you assume that?

51:21.704 --> 51:24.957
Because everyone knows mice
are girls and rats are boys.

51:25.041 --> 51:27.668
Well, how do you think
rats have more rats?

51:29.128 --> 51:31.255
Moving away from that.

51:31.339 --> 51:33.382
Now, the three of you are
going to make sure that

51:33.466 --> 51:35.218
this beautiful young lady
gets to the ball.

51:35.301 --> 51:37.094
We're going to the palace?

51:37.178 --> 51:38.638
But we don't even know
where the palace is.

51:38.721 --> 51:40.181
We've not been past
the front yard.

51:40.264 --> 51:41.933
JAMES: Well, except for that
one time when we had to leave

51:42.016 --> 51:43.392
'cause snakes got
into the house.

51:43.476 --> 51:45.269
-The what?
-Oh.

51:45.353 --> 51:47.522
Yeah, no, we were gonna
tell you, but...

51:47.605 --> 51:49.148
FABULOUS GODMOTHER:
Okay, focus, people.

51:49.232 --> 51:51.234
You are to make sure that
she gets to the ball,

51:51.317 --> 51:53.361
and that is that.

52:02.203 --> 52:04.038
-

52:04.121 --> 52:06.332
-

52:08.292 --> 52:09.836
-Tell 'em, Fab G.

52:09.919 --> 52:11.796
-

52:13.840 --> 52:16.425
-

52:16.509 --> 52:18.886
-

52:20.179 --> 52:21.514
a shining star

52:21.597 --> 52:23.474
-

52:23.558 --> 52:25.810
-

52:29.480 --> 52:30.773
what you can truly be

52:37.905 --> 52:39.532
It's time to go.

52:39.615 --> 52:41.951
Yep, yep.
We should... we should...

52:42.034 --> 52:44.203
What am I doing?

52:44.287 --> 52:45.955
My stepmother will disown me.

52:46.038 --> 52:48.374
I mean, she'd throw me out
into the street.

52:48.457 --> 52:50.877
She told me she would.
She told me she would do that.

52:50.960 --> 52:52.628
Don't worry.
As long as you're in that gown,

52:52.712 --> 52:54.255
no one will be able
to recognize you.

52:54.338 --> 52:55.840
Actually, that's not good.

52:55.923 --> 52:57.842
I'm meeting a stranger there
who's offered to help me.

52:57.925 --> 52:59.844
My, my.

52:59.927 --> 53:01.721
You are high-maintenance.

53:01.804 --> 53:03.472
Fine.

53:03.556 --> 53:06.183
He alone will be the exception.

53:06.267 --> 53:09.312
But when the magic wears off...

53:09.395 --> 53:10.855
Wait a second.
That's possible?

53:10.938 --> 53:13.441
Nothing in life ever
stays the same,

53:13.524 --> 53:15.568
good or bad.

53:15.651 --> 53:17.278
Just remember--

53:17.361 --> 53:21.240
when the clock
strikes midnight, run.

53:26.996 --> 53:28.497
Hyah!

54:05.743 --> 54:07.078
-

54:07.161 --> 54:09.288
Are we really gonna
stay up here the whole night

54:09.372 --> 54:11.540
like lifeless bunting?

54:11.624 --> 54:13.501
You know how much
I love to dance.

54:13.584 --> 54:15.711
Tonight is not about you.
It's about me.

54:17.254 --> 54:19.882
And keeping an eye on our son.

54:19.966 --> 54:22.802
Whether he shows up or not
remains to be seen.

54:26.430 --> 54:28.349
Would this be a good time
for me to bring up

54:28.432 --> 54:30.017
my comprehensive plan
to reduce poverty

54:30.101 --> 54:31.769
-in the urban row housing?
-No, darling.

54:31.852 --> 54:33.688
-Read the room.
-Never.

54:38.109 --> 54:41.529
Ladies and gentlemen,
your prince!

55:05.094 --> 55:06.721
-

55:15.521 --> 55:17.898
what a man, what a man

55:20.985 --> 55:22.987
what a man, what a man

55:24.613 --> 55:26.073
mighty good man

55:26.157 --> 55:28.576
what a man, what a man

55:31.620 --> 55:33.873
what a man, what a man

55:33.956 --> 55:35.541
-

55:35.624 --> 55:37.293
a minute or two

55:38.836 --> 55:40.838
a difference in my world

55:40.921 --> 55:42.548
most men are hos

55:44.091 --> 55:46.052
with another girl

55:46.135 --> 55:48.637
because it's just pathetic

55:48.721 --> 55:51.849
that "he said, she said" crowd

55:51.932 --> 55:53.809
ain't nobody perfect

55:53.893 --> 55:55.394
to those who deserve it

55:55.478 --> 55:57.313
he's worth it

55:57.396 --> 55:59.023
-

55:59.106 --> 56:00.524
the past

56:00.608 --> 56:02.610
that can make me laugh

56:06.197 --> 56:08.074
have your baby

56:08.157 --> 56:10.117
What a man,
what a man, what a man

56:10.201 --> 56:11.619
-

56:13.162 --> 56:15.331
what a man, what a man

56:16.832 --> 56:18.334
mighty good man

56:18.417 --> 56:19.919
what a man, what a man

56:20.002 --> 56:22.046
-

56:23.547 --> 56:25.758
what a man, what a man

56:39.313 --> 56:43.025
couldn't hold me back

56:46.195 --> 56:49.949
right behind my back

56:51.075 --> 56:53.452
to myself at night

56:59.083 --> 57:01.293
through my mind

57:06.507 --> 57:10.136
my eyes says leave it alone

57:24.733 --> 57:27.027
coming back my way

57:29.071 --> 57:31.031
-

57:31.115 --> 57:32.867
What a man,
what a mighty good man

57:32.950 --> 57:34.577
-

57:34.660 --> 57:36.745
What a man,
what a mighty good man

57:36.829 --> 57:38.706
what you want to hear

57:40.749 --> 57:42.251
-

57:42.334 --> 57:44.420
What a man,
what a mighty good man

57:44.503 --> 57:46.172
What
a man, what a man, what a man

57:46.255 --> 57:47.882
mighty, mighty good man

57:47.965 --> 57:49.800
-

57:49.884 --> 57:51.510
-

57:51.594 --> 57:53.137
-

58:01.353 --> 58:03.355
-

58:22.458 --> 58:23.709
HENCH:
Did you see me?

58:23.792 --> 58:25.127
I lifted her up!

58:25.211 --> 58:27.504
GRIFF:
Yeah. Yeah, I know. I know!

58:29.590 --> 58:31.383
Where is she?

58:38.515 --> 58:39.975
I'm so sorry.

58:40.059 --> 58:41.185
I don't know
what I was thinking.

58:41.268 --> 58:42.686
No, please, forgive me.

58:42.770 --> 58:45.397
I'm not accustomed to being
among nobility, Your Grace.

58:46.857 --> 58:48.192
Think nothing of it.

58:48.275 --> 58:51.695
Tonight, we are all equals
in the eye of the king.

58:51.779 --> 58:53.781
You're too kind.

58:55.074 --> 58:56.867
My, what lovely shoes.

58:56.951 --> 58:59.328
They're glass.

58:59.411 --> 59:01.956
-I could walk in them
easily after, like, four steps.

59:04.667 --> 59:06.293
Now, uh, if you'll excuse me,

59:06.377 --> 59:09.672
I was making my way
up to the balcony.

59:09.755 --> 59:12.633
Because the best view
is always from on high.

59:14.385 --> 59:17.137
Oh, my God.

59:17.221 --> 59:20.099
Look at us. We're standing
outside the palace.

59:20.182 --> 59:22.434
W-We're-we're literally
breathing the same air

59:22.518 --> 59:24.019
as the royal family.

59:24.103 --> 59:26.063
Whatever happens after tonight,
I'm a changed mouse.

59:26.146 --> 59:27.273
-Mm-hmm.
-JAMES: Guys!

59:27.356 --> 59:29.149
I just relieved myself,

59:29.233 --> 59:31.360
and you are not gonna believe
how it happens.

59:31.443 --> 59:32.653
Through your front tail.
We know.

59:32.736 --> 59:34.154
-Yes!
-Unbelievable, isn't it?

59:34.238 --> 59:35.698
-Incredible, right? -It's
like...

59:35.781 --> 59:36.949
You're-you're making me
want to go again right now.

59:37.032 --> 59:38.284
JAMES:
You should go. Go now.

59:38.367 --> 59:39.410
I would. Not got the urge.

59:39.493 --> 59:41.704
I mean, could tonight
be any better?!

59:44.290 --> 59:45.749
TATIANA:
Excuse me, my dear.

59:45.833 --> 59:47.459
May I ask you a question?

59:47.543 --> 59:49.086
-Yes, Your Highness.
-

59:49.169 --> 59:51.422
"Your Highness" was the man
whose blood I spilled

59:51.505 --> 59:52.673
to take this crown.

59:52.756 --> 59:54.675
-Ooh.
-Call me Tatiana.

59:54.758 --> 59:57.219
-Queen Tatiana.
-Of course.

59:57.303 --> 59:58.387
Queen Tatiana.

59:58.470 --> 1:00:00.139
Where did you get that dress?

1:00:00.222 --> 1:00:02.766
It's so structured and yet

1:00:02.850 --> 1:00:05.853
so delicate and-and...
and beautiful.

1:00:05.936 --> 1:00:07.730
Me-me did. I--

1:00:07.813 --> 1:00:09.315
It's-it's what I,
what-what I, what I done.

1:00:09.398 --> 1:00:11.859
What I, what I hope--
I-I do--

1:00:11.942 --> 1:00:13.902
I was-- I-I did it.

1:00:13.986 --> 1:00:16.613
I cou-- I want to. I...

1:00:17.990 --> 1:00:20.034
ROBERT:
Good evening, ladies.

1:00:20.117 --> 1:00:21.744
First, I would like to thank
each and every one of you

1:00:21.827 --> 1:00:22.786
for being here.

1:00:22.870 --> 1:00:25.497
You are all so beautiful

1:00:25.581 --> 1:00:27.499
and have so much to offer.

1:00:27.583 --> 1:00:29.877
But if I'm being honest,

1:00:29.960 --> 1:00:32.463
there is only one
who has captured my attention.

1:00:32.546 --> 1:00:34.173
-Sadly, I have not

1:00:34.256 --> 1:00:35.466
cast my eyes on her tonight.

1:00:35.549 --> 1:00:38.093
-

1:00:41.013 --> 1:00:43.223
Sorry. Words. Um...
-

1:00:43.307 --> 1:00:44.683
I designed it.

1:00:44.767 --> 1:00:47.227
Then I am honored
to be in the presence

1:00:47.311 --> 1:00:48.896
of such an artist.

1:00:48.979 --> 1:00:51.648
Would it be possible
to see more of your work?

1:00:52.941 --> 1:00:54.401
-More than possible.
-Good.

1:00:54.485 --> 1:00:56.904
I attend lavish events
around the world,

1:00:56.987 --> 1:00:58.655
and I hate all my clothes.

1:00:58.739 --> 1:01:02.242
I'm looking for someone
to travel with me

1:01:02.326 --> 1:01:04.661
to enliven my wardrobe.

1:01:04.745 --> 1:01:06.246
Maybe that person is you.

1:01:07.289 --> 1:01:08.624
Me?

1:01:08.707 --> 1:01:11.335
We will meet tomorrow
when the clock strikes 4:00.

1:01:11.418 --> 1:01:13.212
I have an hour
before I catch my ship home.

1:01:13.295 --> 1:01:15.923
Yes, yes. I'll be at the
south end of the market square.

1:01:16.006 --> 1:01:18.425
Don't be late.
It's unlikely I'll return here,

1:01:18.509 --> 1:01:21.220
and I have no patience
for those who misuse my time.

1:01:21.303 --> 1:01:22.846
-Of course.
-After all,

1:01:22.930 --> 1:01:25.891
I am a frickin' queen.

1:01:29.353 --> 1:01:31.105
This is why
you save caterpillars.

1:01:31.188 --> 1:01:32.940
ROBERT:
A-And then she suggested

1:01:33.023 --> 1:01:34.691
that I was a mama's boy
who still gets

1:01:34.775 --> 1:01:36.402
a little spanking
on the tush-tush.

1:01:36.485 --> 1:01:37.903
-What?

1:01:37.986 --> 1:01:39.363
ROBERT:
Oh, now, now.

1:01:39.446 --> 1:01:41.198
Don't act like you haven't
heard the rumors yourselves.

1:01:41.281 --> 1:01:44.284
Look, I'm not ashamed
to admit that my mother

1:01:44.368 --> 1:01:46.620
is a wonderful, strong woman.

1:01:48.247 --> 1:01:49.748
We get along very well.

1:01:49.832 --> 1:01:52.167
-But not that well.
-

1:01:52.251 --> 1:01:53.460
My father, on the other hand,

1:01:53.544 --> 1:01:55.129
well, he-he's not exactly
getting any younger.

1:01:55.212 --> 1:01:57.881
-Oh! -Oh!
-

1:01:57.965 --> 1:01:59.007
I'm so sorry.

1:02:04.430 --> 1:02:06.140
Oh, my God.

1:02:06.223 --> 1:02:08.100
That didn't happen.
Didn't happen.

1:02:08.183 --> 1:02:09.893
And even if it did happen,
I'm magic,

1:02:09.977 --> 1:02:11.603
-so nobody can see me.
-Hi.

1:02:12.688 --> 1:02:14.064
-You look, you look
so different. -Me different?

1:02:14.148 --> 1:02:16.150
You're the one
who looks different!

1:02:16.233 --> 1:02:17.818
All clean and...

1:02:17.901 --> 1:02:19.862
-That's a nice jacket.
-

1:02:19.945 --> 1:02:21.780
Why would you let me speak
so poorly of you to your face?

1:02:21.864 --> 1:02:24.366
-I admit it was deceitful,
but... -

1:02:24.450 --> 1:02:26.535
I mean, it worked. Here you are.

1:02:26.618 --> 1:02:28.412
Yes, and I am leaving.

1:02:28.495 --> 1:02:31.290
I've seen the dresses,
I drank the bubble drink,

1:02:31.373 --> 1:02:33.375
and now I actually have a chance
to make my dreams come true.

1:02:33.459 --> 1:02:35.002
So I'm gonna go.

1:02:35.085 --> 1:02:36.628
I'm gonna go
while I'm still ahead.

1:02:36.712 --> 1:02:37.838
Thank you.

1:02:37.921 --> 1:02:39.590
Well, you haven't seen
all of the dresses.

1:02:52.811 --> 1:02:55.772
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd be remiss if I didn't take

1:02:55.856 --> 1:02:58.066
a moment to acknowledge
someone truly special.

1:03:00.027 --> 1:03:02.362
The people's princess,

1:03:02.446 --> 1:03:04.072
my little sister.

1:03:05.199 --> 1:03:06.200
Gwendolyn.

1:03:19.213 --> 1:03:20.756
CINDERELLA:
That's my dress.

1:03:20.839 --> 1:03:23.300
That's-that's my dress
on the princess.

1:03:23.383 --> 1:03:25.302
-Are you all right?
-

1:03:25.385 --> 1:03:27.596
I'm fine, I'm fine.
I just, uh...

1:03:27.679 --> 1:03:30.098
I need you to stop the room
from spinning.

1:03:30.182 --> 1:03:32.184
Perhaps this will work.

1:03:33.519 --> 1:03:35.896
M-Maybe would you like to dance?

1:03:35.979 --> 1:03:37.689
Right now?

1:04:22.192 --> 1:04:28.824
the someone waiting for me

1:04:54.641 --> 1:04:57.185
-

1:05:19.791 --> 1:05:22.878
our favorite song

1:05:58.372 --> 1:06:01.583
our favorite song

1:06:05.212 --> 1:06:11.843
an angel in person

1:06:15.555 --> 1:06:19.601
-

1:06:19.685 --> 1:06:23.522
-

1:06:27.150 --> 1:06:29.152
-

1:06:37.536 --> 1:06:40.539
Would you care to talk
alone somewhere?

1:06:40.622 --> 1:06:42.249
Lead the way.

1:06:48.255 --> 1:06:50.841
-What's it like being a crate?

1:06:50.924 --> 1:06:52.634
Like, this has got to be
a step up, right?

1:06:52.718 --> 1:06:54.845
-ROBERT: So this is
the fountain. -CINDERELLA: Ooh.

1:06:54.928 --> 1:06:56.638
ROBERT: Do you have
a fountain where you live?

1:06:56.722 --> 1:06:57.848
CINDERELLA:
Um, I don't.

1:06:57.931 --> 1:07:00.559
I just have
streaming water sometimes.

1:07:01.601 --> 1:07:03.228
-What is that? What is that?
-Did you hear that? That.

1:07:04.479 --> 1:07:07.190
-What?!
-This is bloody brilliant.

1:07:07.274 --> 1:07:08.900
What even is that?

1:07:10.068 --> 1:07:12.404
-We're just banging 'em
together. -I know.

1:07:12.487 --> 1:07:14.698
Humans can be so loud.

1:07:22.998 --> 1:07:24.541
-CINDERELLA: You make me
nervous. -ROBERT: Aw.

1:07:24.624 --> 1:07:28.295
Everything about tonight
is insane, right?

1:07:28.378 --> 1:07:30.922
B-Blink once
if you can understand me.

1:07:32.132 --> 1:07:33.300
-

1:07:33.383 --> 1:07:34.593
-ROBERT: You all right?
-CINDERELLA: Yeah.

1:07:34.676 --> 1:07:36.219
-Thanks for the jacket.
-ROBERT: Yeah.

1:07:36.303 --> 1:07:38.221
No, it's not like
I'm cold or anything.

1:07:41.183 --> 1:07:43.226
-Here we are.
-Wow.

1:07:44.644 --> 1:07:47.063
It's beautiful.

1:07:48.106 --> 1:07:49.649
Oh, um, I should probably
take my shoes off.

1:07:49.733 --> 1:07:50.734
-Right?
-Oh, no, you're fine.

1:07:50.817 --> 1:07:53.403
This floor is literally
2,000 years old.

1:07:54.988 --> 1:07:56.823
-So no?
-You're fine.

1:07:56.907 --> 1:07:59.201
-Okay.
-

1:08:03.455 --> 1:08:05.707
Are you gonna play something
on the piano just for me?

1:08:07.542 --> 1:08:09.377
Oh, my God, you are.

1:08:37.948 --> 1:08:39.950
Wow.

1:08:40.033 --> 1:08:43.161
You're so full
of hidden talents.

1:08:43.245 --> 1:08:45.372
So it sounds like you might
disagree with those who say

1:08:45.455 --> 1:08:48.041
I "serve no real purpose
other than to wreck things"?

1:08:49.084 --> 1:08:50.377
Just so you know,

1:08:50.460 --> 1:08:52.045
I don't actually think
those things about you.

1:08:52.128 --> 1:08:53.296
Especially now.

1:08:54.422 --> 1:08:55.632
Well, you should.

1:08:56.675 --> 1:08:57.843
Wh-Why?

1:08:57.926 --> 1:09:01.221
I mean, you're in line
to be our future king.

1:09:01.304 --> 1:09:03.098
Oh, it's a bad system.

1:09:03.181 --> 1:09:04.099
My only qualification being

1:09:04.182 --> 1:09:06.852
-that my dad was one.
-Mm.

1:09:08.812 --> 1:09:11.815
It's not that
I don't want to be king.

1:09:11.898 --> 1:09:15.193
When I was little,
I remember watching my father

1:09:15.277 --> 1:09:18.780
go off to war
and thinking how...

1:09:18.864 --> 1:09:21.074
brave he looked in his armor.

1:09:22.492 --> 1:09:25.328
And I wanted to be
just like him.

1:09:25.412 --> 1:09:30.250
And then, as I got older
and my life became

1:09:30.333 --> 1:09:33.169
more about
traditions and customs

1:09:33.253 --> 1:09:38.091
and people always watching me
and telling me what to do...

1:09:40.010 --> 1:09:45.390
...and never asking
what I want or how I feel...

1:09:46.433 --> 1:09:48.393
I know exactly what you mean.

1:09:53.273 --> 1:09:54.399
What?

1:09:54.482 --> 1:09:56.276
I just had...

1:09:56.359 --> 1:09:58.653
no idea
tonight would go like this.

1:09:59.696 --> 1:10:02.449
This is precisely
how I hoped tonight would go.

1:10:03.700 --> 1:10:05.535
You're the one.

1:10:07.370 --> 1:10:09.122
I pick you to be my princess.

1:10:10.457 --> 1:10:12.375
What's wrong?

1:10:12.459 --> 1:10:14.127
I-I assure you
it doesn't matter to me

1:10:14.210 --> 1:10:15.337
that you're not of royal birth.

1:10:15.420 --> 1:10:16.546
No, that's not it.

1:10:16.630 --> 1:10:18.131
W-We'll get married.

1:10:18.214 --> 1:10:19.591
Okay? We'll-we'll get married

1:10:19.674 --> 1:10:21.551
and you will live the rest
of your life as royalty.

1:10:21.635 --> 1:10:23.929
Royalty? What about my work?

1:10:24.012 --> 1:10:25.096
M-My dresses can...

1:10:25.180 --> 1:10:27.599
Well, that would
most likely be frowned upon.

1:10:27.682 --> 1:10:29.643
Women have
a very prescribed role in court.

1:10:29.726 --> 1:10:31.645
-"Prescribed role in court"?
-But I would make sure

1:10:31.728 --> 1:10:33.355
that you were dressed by
the finest dressmakers

1:10:33.438 --> 1:10:35.148
-in all the land.
-I'm a dressmaker.

1:10:35.231 --> 1:10:37.150
I know. There's just
no one else in this world

1:10:37.233 --> 1:10:38.443
I'd rather be with than you.

1:10:38.526 --> 1:10:39.861
Robert, stop.

1:10:41.279 --> 1:10:43.406
I don't want a life stuck
waving from a royal box

1:10:43.490 --> 1:10:45.867
any more than a life
confined to a basement.

1:10:45.951 --> 1:10:49.371
I have dreams
that I have to chase.

1:10:51.081 --> 1:10:53.333
So if it's a choice...

1:10:56.461 --> 1:10:58.088
...I choose me.

1:11:05.011 --> 1:11:06.513
I understand.

1:11:10.809 --> 1:11:14.020
Really, I... I do.

1:12:21.046 --> 1:12:23.048
I'm sorry.

1:12:35.185 --> 1:12:36.311
What time is it?

1:12:36.394 --> 1:12:37.937
It's midnight.

1:12:39.022 --> 1:12:40.148
I have to go.

1:12:40.231 --> 1:12:41.357
Wait!

1:12:42.400 --> 1:12:44.235
-I don't like this.

1:12:44.319 --> 1:12:46.696
-Some-Something's changed.
-Relax. We are fine.

1:12:46.780 --> 1:12:48.031
JOHN:
Ah!

1:12:48.114 --> 1:12:49.157
You just cleaned
phantom whiskers.

1:12:49.240 --> 1:12:51.076
-No, I did not.
-You did, too.

1:12:51.159 --> 1:12:54.120
-

1:12:54.204 --> 1:12:55.997
TATIANA:
Where are you off to, my dear?

1:12:56.081 --> 1:12:58.291
Am I to assume
I've lost you to the prince?

1:12:58.374 --> 1:13:00.919
No, my queen. I'll meet you
tomorrow, I promise.

1:13:01.753 --> 1:13:03.588
What's happening?

1:13:03.671 --> 1:13:05.799
My good people,
your future queen.

1:13:05.882 --> 1:13:08.384
-

1:13:17.310 --> 1:13:18.436
Help.

1:13:18.520 --> 1:13:20.021
This way. This way.

1:13:21.231 --> 1:13:22.649
Wilbur.

1:13:22.732 --> 1:13:23.900
Mm.

1:13:23.983 --> 1:13:26.194
You go.
I'll take care of this.

1:13:26.277 --> 1:13:28.363
Thank you so much.
I'll never forget this.

1:13:28.446 --> 1:13:30.115
Neither will I.

1:13:31.783 --> 1:13:33.785
The magic's wearing off.

1:13:33.868 --> 1:13:35.954
-What are we gonna do?
-What did the butterfly say?

1:13:36.037 --> 1:13:38.206
He called us disgusting,
that jerk.

1:13:38.289 --> 1:13:39.791
About the magic.
What was said about the magic?

1:13:39.874 --> 1:13:42.085
I don't know.
I was singing.

1:13:42.168 --> 1:13:44.254
-Why didn't you pay attention?
-Because I was singing!

1:13:44.337 --> 1:13:45.839
-
continues indistinctly)

1:13:50.260 --> 1:13:51.886
Dress your feet for comfort!

1:13:52.804 --> 1:13:54.347
-Get in.
-

1:13:54.430 --> 1:13:56.307
-Halt, I say!
-

1:14:00.895 --> 1:14:02.397
JAMES:
Come on, quick!

1:14:03.773 --> 1:14:05.733
-Get in! Quickly! Hurry!
-JOHN: Come on!

1:14:14.659 --> 1:14:17.036
Look. She threw
a glass shoe at me.

1:14:19.956 --> 1:14:22.250
I-I feel all tingly.

1:14:22.333 --> 1:14:23.918
Like I'm gonna...

1:14:25.920 --> 1:14:27.505
Now I'm feeling tingly.

1:14:27.589 --> 1:14:29.382
I don't want to go...

1:14:32.635 --> 1:14:35.263
Don't look at me!
Don't look at me!

1:14:37.849 --> 1:14:39.767
ROMESH: I'm starting
to feel a bit funny.

1:14:39.851 --> 1:14:41.269
I feel tingly!

1:14:41.352 --> 1:14:42.604
-CINDERELLA: No!

1:14:52.280 --> 1:14:53.948
No!

1:15:10.048 --> 1:15:11.132
Are we going down?

1:15:11.216 --> 1:15:12.258
-We're going down.
-

1:15:12.342 --> 1:15:13.635
Just be quiet as a mouse.

1:15:18.514 --> 1:15:19.933
Hmm.

1:15:20.016 --> 1:15:21.267
JAMES:
Maybe we're not going...

1:15:47.877 --> 1:15:50.338
Mm, mm, mm, mm.

1:15:50.421 --> 1:15:53.675
All the townspeople's
tax dollars

1:15:53.758 --> 1:15:56.094
wasted on a ball, and for what?

1:15:56.177 --> 1:15:59.055
For you to make
a complete fool out of me?

1:15:59.138 --> 1:16:00.807
To teach me a lesson?

1:16:00.890 --> 1:16:02.225
I'm sorry, Father.

1:16:02.308 --> 1:16:04.936
You are single-handedly
destroying my legacy.

1:16:05.019 --> 1:16:08.022
I know you might not
understand this,

1:16:08.106 --> 1:16:10.316
but the woman I chose
didn't choose me.

1:16:10.400 --> 1:16:12.277
Oh, I'm sorry, darling.

1:16:14.070 --> 1:16:15.780
Aw.

1:16:15.863 --> 1:16:17.448
Have you lost your mind?!

1:16:17.532 --> 1:16:19.826
You are the future king,

1:16:19.909 --> 1:16:24.080
and as king, it is all about you
and your power.

1:16:24.163 --> 1:16:26.124
There are no other opinions.
None.

1:16:31.170 --> 1:16:32.714
Is this a good time to ask

1:16:32.797 --> 1:16:34.507
why we are spending money
on catapults

1:16:34.590 --> 1:16:36.509
-when we have so many already?
-

1:16:36.592 --> 1:16:38.636
It really just benefits
the catapult makers.

1:16:38.720 --> 1:16:40.596
Quiet, Gwen!

1:16:40.680 --> 1:16:42.473
I really think we just need
to get some sleep.

1:16:42.557 --> 1:16:44.100
No one asked you, Beatrice.

1:16:53.609 --> 1:16:55.111
Your time is up, Robert.

1:16:56.904 --> 1:17:00.199
You will marry Princess Laura
by week's end.

1:17:00.283 --> 1:17:02.618
I don't care
if you don't love each other.

1:17:03.995 --> 1:17:05.788
So says the king.

1:17:12.253 --> 1:17:15.882
If the crown demands it...

1:17:15.965 --> 1:17:17.800
milord.

1:17:22.347 --> 1:17:24.015
Darling.

1:17:32.482 --> 1:17:33.900
What?

1:17:34.942 --> 1:17:36.527
Did you really just say
you don't care

1:17:36.611 --> 1:17:37.945
if they love each other?

1:17:38.988 --> 1:17:40.656
Yeah. I want the sea monster.

1:17:40.740 --> 1:17:42.575
What? Bea-Bea-Beatrice,
don't be...

1:17:42.658 --> 1:17:44.494
Ay... ay, ay, ay.

1:17:44.577 --> 1:17:45.912
-Your Highness.
-Yes?

1:17:45.995 --> 1:17:47.789
-Where'd you find that?
-It's the girl's.

1:17:47.872 --> 1:17:51.125
She threw it at my head.
I'm lucky to be alive.

1:18:02.887 --> 1:18:04.055
Look at our girl.

1:18:04.138 --> 1:18:05.848
Been up all night working.

1:18:05.932 --> 1:18:08.142
-She's betting on herself.
-JAMES: I couldn't do it.

1:18:08.226 --> 1:18:09.685
I would've married the prince.

1:18:09.769 --> 1:18:12.063
You think the prince
would've picked you?

1:18:12.146 --> 1:18:14.524
Cuddly, cute, good at waving.

1:18:14.607 --> 1:18:15.775
I mean, come on.

1:18:17.860 --> 1:18:19.404
I can hear you.

1:18:19.487 --> 1:18:20.988
I bet you're arguing about why

1:18:21.072 --> 1:18:23.741
I didn't just say yes
to marrying Robert.

1:18:23.825 --> 1:18:26.786
Especially since I'm maybe
in love with him.

1:18:26.869 --> 1:18:28.496
JOHN:
Love? It was one night.

1:18:28.579 --> 1:18:29.872
-

1:18:29.956 --> 1:18:32.208
I never felt what I felt
last night before.

1:18:33.835 --> 1:18:36.295
I mean, you guys,
he's so handsome.

1:18:36.379 --> 1:18:37.797
-Oh, yes, he is incredibly
handsome. -Absolutely.

1:18:37.880 --> 1:18:39.507
-Annoyingly handsome.
-The cheekbones.

1:18:39.590 --> 1:18:40.758
And he likes me for me.

1:18:40.842 --> 1:18:42.301
Sounds like true love
to this mouse.

1:18:42.385 --> 1:18:44.095
You're right, my friend.

1:18:44.178 --> 1:18:47.098
But if saying yes to him

1:18:47.181 --> 1:18:50.017
means saying no to this...

1:18:51.102 --> 1:18:53.729
...I can't do it.

1:18:53.813 --> 1:18:55.648
All right, guys?

1:18:55.731 --> 1:18:59.444
I have to try and make a life
for myself, by myself.

1:18:59.527 --> 1:19:01.946
Because that is what I want.

1:19:02.029 --> 1:19:04.198
And Queen Tatiana is my chance.

1:19:04.282 --> 1:19:05.533
Right.

1:19:05.616 --> 1:19:06.993
-Who's Queen Tatiana?
-

1:19:07.076 --> 1:19:08.286
VIVIAN:
Cinderella, are you down there?

1:19:08.369 --> 1:19:09.579
-Stepmother?
-Dear God, no.

1:19:09.662 --> 1:19:11.497
-She scares me.
-Me, too.

1:19:11.581 --> 1:19:15.084
-Hello.
I'm waiting for my tea.

1:19:15.168 --> 1:19:17.587
Cinderella.
Oh, I'm coming down.

1:19:25.428 --> 1:19:26.721
I'm sick.

1:19:27.847 --> 1:19:29.599
Uh-huh.

1:19:36.731 --> 1:19:38.900
Well, you didn't miss much
at the ball.

1:19:41.736 --> 1:19:44.989
The prince was fixated
on some mystery girl.

1:19:46.574 --> 1:19:49.285
Then she ran away like a twit.

1:19:49.368 --> 1:19:52.747
So now he's to marry
Princess Laura of Northphalia

1:19:52.830 --> 1:19:54.373
the day after next.

1:19:54.457 --> 1:19:57.543
Malvolia and Narissa,
they never stood a chance.

1:19:58.586 --> 1:20:01.130
And I was so foolish
to believe differently.

1:20:02.423 --> 1:20:04.967
A mother just gets carried away.

1:20:07.345 --> 1:20:09.555
I know I've been hard on you.

1:20:10.932 --> 1:20:12.767
It's not fueled by spite.

1:20:24.153 --> 1:20:27.073
I've never shared this
with anyone before, but...

1:20:30.076 --> 1:20:32.119
I used to play piano.

1:20:32.203 --> 1:20:34.247
Taught myself.

1:20:36.082 --> 1:20:38.626
And I was good.

1:20:38.709 --> 1:20:41.754
I was really good.

1:20:43.881 --> 1:20:45.716
Nothing made me happier.

1:20:47.552 --> 1:20:50.596
Then one day,
I was given the opportunity

1:20:50.680 --> 1:20:53.724
to train at the finest
school of music,

1:20:53.808 --> 1:20:56.352
and I took it.

1:20:56.435 --> 1:20:58.354
There I was--

1:20:58.437 --> 1:21:01.315
two children, a loving husband,

1:21:01.399 --> 1:21:04.944
and I had the audacity
to want more.

1:21:07.488 --> 1:21:11.033
It was just a month-- one month.

1:21:11.117 --> 1:21:15.371
And yet, when I returned,
my husband, well...

1:21:17.248 --> 1:21:20.209
...he believed real wives
didn't act so frivolously.

1:21:27.341 --> 1:21:29.510
You may think me cruel.

1:21:37.893 --> 1:21:40.479
But the real cruelty would be
for me to allow you to think

1:21:40.563 --> 1:21:42.315
that you can be
something you can't.

1:21:57.872 --> 1:21:59.290
This shoe.

1:22:04.795 --> 1:22:06.339
It was you.

1:22:06.422 --> 1:22:07.882
Cinderella.

1:22:07.965 --> 1:22:10.593
I don't know how you did
what you did last night,

1:22:10.676 --> 1:22:12.720
but the prince chose you.
He loves you.

1:22:12.803 --> 1:22:14.930
Marry him, and all of
our problems will be solved.

1:22:15.014 --> 1:22:17.433
I can't. I told him
I didn't want to marry him.

1:22:17.516 --> 1:22:18.768
Tell him you were wrong.

1:22:18.851 --> 1:22:20.603
Tell him... tell him
it's all you want.

1:22:20.686 --> 1:22:22.605
If not for yourself,
then-then do it for us.

1:22:22.688 --> 1:22:23.856
For your family.

1:22:23.939 --> 1:22:25.483
I can help our family,
Stepmother.

1:22:25.566 --> 1:22:26.609
I can provide for us.

1:22:26.692 --> 1:22:27.735
Don't be so stupid.

1:22:27.818 --> 1:22:29.278
Who taught you
to think that way?

1:22:29.362 --> 1:22:31.447
Please, Cinderella, don't
throw away this opportunity.

1:22:31.530 --> 1:22:32.740
Go back to him.

1:22:32.823 --> 1:22:35.826
It's too late.

1:22:35.910 --> 1:22:37.828
He's marrying someone else.

1:22:37.912 --> 1:22:39.538
It's over.

1:22:45.419 --> 1:22:47.046
Fine.

1:22:51.634 --> 1:22:53.803
Then I'm taking you to Thomas,

1:22:53.886 --> 1:22:56.597
and I'm giving you to him today.

1:22:57.682 --> 1:22:59.892
I would rather die.

1:23:25.626 --> 1:23:29.130
bury it

1:23:31.841 --> 1:23:35.052
carry it

1:23:35.136 --> 1:23:38.639
to your grave, oh

1:24:05.249 --> 1:24:09.712
of letting you fly

1:24:12.047 --> 1:24:15.468
in the wrong time

1:24:15.551 --> 1:24:18.012
-

1:24:18.095 --> 1:24:21.015
-

1:24:21.098 --> 1:24:24.101
-

1:24:37.615 --> 1:24:39.825
-

1:24:39.909 --> 1:24:43.078
-

1:24:43.162 --> 1:24:44.622
-

1:24:44.705 --> 1:24:46.290
-

1:24:46.373 --> 1:24:49.168
-

1:24:49.251 --> 1:24:52.338
-

1:24:52.421 --> 1:24:55.341
-

1:24:55.424 --> 1:24:56.717
-

1:24:56.801 --> 1:24:59.011
-

1:24:59.094 --> 1:25:01.597
-

1:25:01.680 --> 1:25:04.683
Bury it, marry it,
carry it, carry it

1:26:08.122 --> 1:26:10.124
Leave us.

1:26:18.465 --> 1:26:20.467
You haven't spoken to me
since last night.

1:26:23.012 --> 1:26:24.597
You're mad
because I yelled at you.

1:26:26.432 --> 1:26:29.143
I hate to break it to you,
but kings yell.

1:26:30.853 --> 1:26:33.355
Please, say something.

1:26:33.439 --> 1:26:35.649
You're making me
wildly uncomfortable.

1:26:38.611 --> 1:26:40.487
Have you ever wondered
why Robert makes

1:26:40.571 --> 1:26:42.448
the process to marry
so difficult?

1:26:42.531 --> 1:26:46.118
Because he's a spoiled child
who refuses to grow up. Simple.

1:26:46.201 --> 1:26:49.747
I believe it's because of the
example set before him by us.

1:26:49.830 --> 1:26:52.207
A marriage without love,
without respect.

1:26:52.291 --> 1:26:53.959
Bea, please,
you know I love you.

1:26:54.043 --> 1:26:55.711
Saying "love" and showing love

1:26:55.794 --> 1:26:58.380
are two very different things,
Rowan.

1:26:58.464 --> 1:27:01.842
Before you were king,
I felt your love every day.

1:27:01.926 --> 1:27:04.470
You couldn't stand to be away
from me, even for a moment.

1:27:04.553 --> 1:27:06.972
Remember, you used to appear
at my window

1:27:07.056 --> 1:27:08.974
like a knight in shining armor

1:27:09.058 --> 1:27:12.478
and you'd serenade me
with your skull-splitting voice.

1:27:12.561 --> 1:27:14.146
We were young.

1:27:14.229 --> 1:27:17.066
Things... change.

1:27:17.149 --> 1:27:18.984
No. You changed.

1:27:19.068 --> 1:27:20.611
The crown changed you.

1:27:20.694 --> 1:27:23.489
You're so worried
to look a fool.

1:27:23.572 --> 1:27:26.825
So obsessed with your
reputation, with your legacy.

1:27:26.909 --> 1:27:28.911
Well, it's only my life's work.

1:27:28.994 --> 1:27:31.163
It causes me
a great deal of stress.

1:27:31.246 --> 1:27:33.248
Do you think you're the only
person who feels stress?

1:27:33.332 --> 1:27:35.751
God, try being your bloody wife.

1:27:35.834 --> 1:27:39.421
It is utterly exhausting to sit
next to you and just smile

1:27:39.505 --> 1:27:41.423
as if I were nothing more
than a prop,

1:27:41.507 --> 1:27:44.259
my voice completely silenced.

1:27:44.343 --> 1:27:46.428
I mean, what I wouldn't give
to say, "You're wrong,"

1:27:46.512 --> 1:27:48.389
in front of the entire kingdom.

1:27:48.472 --> 1:27:49.974
Bea...

1:27:50.057 --> 1:27:52.101
you're being unreasonable now.

1:27:53.894 --> 1:27:56.021
Well, if you say so.

1:27:56.105 --> 1:27:58.107
After all, you're the king.

1:28:00.109 --> 1:28:02.486
Can't be any other opinions
other than yours.

1:28:07.366 --> 1:28:10.411
Do you know,
there's never a guarantee

1:28:10.494 --> 1:28:13.414
with a couple in our position.

1:28:13.497 --> 1:28:15.666
But we had love, Rowan.

1:28:15.749 --> 1:28:17.835
We had it.

1:28:17.918 --> 1:28:19.545
And now...

1:28:21.964 --> 1:28:24.174
Robert's wiser than both of us.

1:28:31.849 --> 1:28:33.475
Hello.

1:28:36.395 --> 1:28:38.022
I'm ready.

1:28:46.280 --> 1:28:48.699
You summoned me, Your Highness?

1:28:50.617 --> 1:28:52.911
We can't have
a regular conversation

1:28:52.995 --> 1:28:54.830
like a normal father and son,
can we?

1:28:54.913 --> 1:28:56.623
No, no.

1:28:56.707 --> 1:28:58.584
To satisfy your power trip,
you have to sit there

1:28:58.667 --> 1:29:00.586
on your slightly too tall
throne.

1:29:00.669 --> 1:29:02.046
You-you belittle me in your...

1:29:02.129 --> 1:29:05.424
your-your king voice, yes.

1:29:05.507 --> 1:29:07.760
All because you're so insecure

1:29:07.843 --> 1:29:10.345
with your legacy that you
have to control my every move.

1:29:10.429 --> 1:29:12.014
Now, I ask you,

1:29:12.097 --> 1:29:14.266
does that sound
like a strong leader to you?

1:29:14.349 --> 1:29:15.726
ROWAN:
Robert...

1:29:17.394 --> 1:29:19.354
I was wrong.

1:29:27.571 --> 1:29:30.991
I, King Rowan...

1:29:32.284 --> 1:29:33.952
Am I doing the king voice?

1:29:34.036 --> 1:29:35.621
A little bit.
You can't help yourself.

1:29:43.629 --> 1:29:45.964
Go find the owner
of this glass slipper.

1:29:46.048 --> 1:29:50.177
And if she'll take you back,
then marry her.

1:29:50.260 --> 1:29:51.887
Or don't.

1:29:53.430 --> 1:29:54.973
It's your life, son.

1:29:55.057 --> 1:29:56.600
Wh-Why the sudden
change of heart?

1:29:56.683 --> 1:29:59.728
Well, definitely
wasn't your mum.

1:30:00.896 --> 1:30:02.815
-Go on, leave now.
-

1:30:02.898 --> 1:30:04.608
Be bold.

1:30:13.325 --> 1:30:15.119
you won't believe

1:30:16.578 --> 1:30:18.330
at the ball

1:30:18.413 --> 1:30:20.916
for a pretty young lady

1:30:20.999 --> 1:30:23.043
who then turned out to be

1:30:23.127 --> 1:30:24.962
see, at the end of the night

1:30:25.045 --> 1:30:27.589
she left no name

1:30:27.673 --> 1:30:29.133
just a shoe made of glass

1:30:29.216 --> 1:30:30.926
for the girl

1:30:31.009 --> 1:30:33.387
no buckles, no laces

1:30:33.470 --> 1:30:35.264
-ROSEMARY:

1:30:35.347 --> 1:30:37.266
does it look like this?

1:30:37.349 --> 1:30:39.184
swing and a miss

1:30:39.268 --> 1:30:41.854
could my foot be right?

1:30:41.937 --> 1:30:44.731
a canoe, ma'am, way too tight

1:30:44.815 --> 1:30:46.859
that I birthed

1:30:56.535 --> 1:30:57.703
-Mm.
-

1:30:57.786 --> 1:30:59.246
That is too bad.

1:30:59.329 --> 1:31:01.206
But I like those vocal runs.

1:31:03.375 --> 1:31:06.170
who needs convincing

1:31:06.253 --> 1:31:08.505
with the ring-a-ding-ding

1:31:08.589 --> 1:31:11.300
in the shoe that goes bling

1:31:11.383 --> 1:31:14.219
tell it to your future king.

1:31:18.056 --> 1:31:19.099
Not her.

1:31:24.771 --> 1:31:25.772
Worth a try.

1:31:29.151 --> 1:31:30.402
No.

1:31:36.700 --> 1:31:38.702
I mean, don't they know
I'm looking for her?

1:31:41.747 --> 1:31:42.664
No.

1:31:42.748 --> 1:31:43.790
Nope, not her.

1:31:45.125 --> 1:31:46.210
Nope.

1:31:49.880 --> 1:31:51.340
Nope. No. No.

1:31:57.429 --> 1:31:59.264
Not interested.

1:32:00.974 --> 1:32:02.726
I mean, me, neither.

1:32:02.809 --> 1:32:04.686
You don't say.

1:32:06.688 --> 1:32:08.649
We're not going to find her.

1:32:08.732 --> 1:32:10.651
-We should just go home.
-I can't.

1:32:10.734 --> 1:32:13.111
I have to let her know
that it's possible between us.

1:32:13.195 --> 1:32:16.573
It's a beautiful thing
how much you love her.

1:32:16.657 --> 1:32:19.910
-You crying, Hench?
-So what if I am?

1:32:19.993 --> 1:32:22.120
Would that we all have
what Robert has.

1:32:22.204 --> 1:32:25.165
I mean, what is life

1:32:25.249 --> 1:32:27.251
if you're not with
the person you love?

1:32:27.334 --> 1:32:28.961
Right?

1:32:29.044 --> 1:32:31.755
Otherwise, we might as well
just close our eyes

1:32:31.838 --> 1:32:36.760
and take the ol' mud nap,
because...

1:32:36.843 --> 1:32:39.221
nothing else matters.

1:32:41.014 --> 1:32:43.100
So we find her, then.

1:32:43.183 --> 1:32:44.685
Robert, where did you see her

1:32:44.768 --> 1:32:46.311
the last time
you went searching?

1:32:48.855 --> 1:32:50.983
I am the king's idiot son.

1:32:51.066 --> 1:32:52.442
-Hyah!
-

1:33:10.877 --> 1:33:13.797
VIVIAN: Cinderella's been
working on her recipes for you.

1:33:13.880 --> 1:33:15.924
THOMAS:
Well, I should hope so.

1:33:24.808 --> 1:33:25.767
Two, three.

1:33:25.851 --> 1:33:28.020
ALL:
For Ella...!

1:33:30.564 --> 1:33:32.983
Remember me as a hero!

1:33:33.066 --> 1:33:35.193
-

1:33:59.217 --> 1:34:03.138
a shot in the dark

1:34:03.221 --> 1:34:05.015
pride and shame

1:34:05.098 --> 1:34:06.850
CINDERELLA:

1:34:06.933 --> 1:34:09.102
-

1:34:09.186 --> 1:34:11.646
-

1:34:11.730 --> 1:34:13.357
ROBERT:

1:34:15.275 --> 1:34:17.527
as an untold story

1:34:17.611 --> 1:34:19.154
CINDERELLA:

1:34:19.237 --> 1:34:22.699
-

1:34:22.783 --> 1:34:25.660
in a blaze of glory

1:34:29.623 --> 1:34:32.042
-

1:34:34.086 --> 1:34:35.879
You all right?

1:34:38.215 --> 1:34:40.425
-What are you doing here?
-Are you hurt?

1:34:40.509 --> 1:34:42.219
No, I-I'm fine.
I just really have to...

1:34:42.302 --> 1:34:43.595
Good. I've been looking for you.

1:34:43.678 --> 1:34:44.971
Why?

1:34:45.055 --> 1:34:46.848
I have something
that I want to say.

1:34:46.932 --> 1:34:48.350
You inspired me.

1:34:48.433 --> 1:34:49.893
Me?

1:34:49.976 --> 1:34:51.770
It never occurred to me
that I could choose

1:34:51.853 --> 1:34:53.480
the course of my own life.

1:34:53.563 --> 1:34:56.566
See, I-I always felt
that it was written for me.

1:34:56.650 --> 1:34:59.778
But watching you, I-I realized
that anything is possible.

1:34:59.861 --> 1:35:01.655
That's so sweet.

1:35:01.738 --> 1:35:03.907
I'm just really in a hurry.
If we could talk about it...

1:35:03.990 --> 1:35:06.701
I realize now that I can have
a life that is all mine.

1:35:06.785 --> 1:35:08.829
Great. This is gonna
be a lengthy discussion.

1:35:08.912 --> 1:35:12.249
What I'm trying to say
is that I choose me.

1:35:12.332 --> 1:35:13.708
Hmm?

1:35:13.792 --> 1:35:16.795
God, this is not coming out
how I wanted it to.

1:35:18.547 --> 1:35:20.465
I don't have to be king.

1:35:20.549 --> 1:35:22.092
It is not what I want anymore.

1:35:22.175 --> 1:35:23.427
You are.

1:35:23.510 --> 1:35:26.221
So, what I'm saying is

1:35:26.304 --> 1:35:28.723
choosing me is choosing us.

1:35:30.350 --> 1:35:32.936
That is, as long as
you feel the same way.

1:35:36.606 --> 1:35:37.774
Your silence is...

1:35:55.542 --> 1:35:57.461
That was the most romantic
moment of my life.

1:35:57.544 --> 1:35:58.628
Same.

1:35:58.712 --> 1:36:00.922
-I mean, you rode up on a horse.
-I did.

1:36:01.006 --> 1:36:01.965
It was really cool.

1:36:02.048 --> 1:36:03.592
You look so beautiful.

1:36:03.675 --> 1:36:05.177
-You look so handsome.
-Thank you.

1:36:05.260 --> 1:36:07.262
Oh, uh, got to go.
I need you to

1:36:07.345 --> 1:36:09.639
put me on that horse and get me
to the market square, please.

1:36:09.723 --> 1:36:11.141
-Okay.
-What? No.

1:36:11.224 --> 1:36:12.767
-No? Okay. I'm sorry. Yes.
-I can walk. It's-it's faster.

1:36:12.851 --> 1:36:14.019
But thank you.
That's really nice.

1:36:16.563 --> 1:36:19.316
-ROWAN Beatrice!

1:36:20.775 --> 1:36:22.360
Beatrice!

1:36:22.444 --> 1:36:25.489
What fresh hell is this?

1:36:25.572 --> 1:36:26.531
Beatrice!

1:36:26.615 --> 1:36:29.534
It is I, your knight
in shining armor.

1:36:32.871 --> 1:36:35.999
You can't be serious.

1:36:36.082 --> 1:36:39.503
Darling, suspend
what you know to be true.

1:36:39.586 --> 1:36:41.588
Just...

1:36:42.672 --> 1:36:44.883
Just-just go with it.

1:36:46.968 --> 1:36:48.970
Oh, no. He's gonna sing.

1:36:52.682 --> 1:36:54.100
-

1:36:56.102 --> 1:36:58.271
You really don't
have to do this.

1:36:58.355 --> 1:36:59.648
But I do, darling.

1:36:59.731 --> 1:37:01.399
This is exactly what you wanted.

1:37:01.483 --> 1:37:02.901
Nope. No. Not really.

1:37:10.242 --> 1:37:11.785
Everybody.

1:37:13.995 --> 1:37:15.705
-

1:37:15.789 --> 1:37:17.415
-Oh, my God.
-

1:37:17.499 --> 1:37:19.084
Okay,
that's enough. That's enough.

1:37:19.167 --> 1:37:20.168
Yes. Thank you.

1:37:21.878 --> 1:37:22.879
Oh. Big finish.

1:37:38.728 --> 1:37:42.899
-

1:37:42.983 --> 1:37:45.235
-

1:37:45.318 --> 1:37:47.821
BEATRICE:

1:37:47.904 --> 1:37:49.781
-Oh, my love.

1:37:50.991 --> 1:37:52.784
Oh. Can I come up?

1:37:52.867 --> 1:37:54.160
Yes, if you can get
your armor off.

1:38:07.799 --> 1:38:09.426
Pack your bags.

1:38:10.802 --> 1:38:12.637
-Huh?
-

1:38:12.721 --> 1:38:13.722
Huzzah!

1:38:16.266 --> 1:38:17.892
-ROBERT: Yes!
-

1:38:19.352 --> 1:38:20.979
-ROBERT: Mother? Father?
-In here,

1:38:21.062 --> 1:38:22.397
being immortalized.

1:38:22.480 --> 1:38:24.524
There's someone
I would like you to meet.

1:38:24.608 --> 1:38:26.484
-I'm Ella.
-Now, how lovely.

1:38:26.568 --> 1:38:29.070
Oh, yeah, I remember you.

1:38:29.154 --> 1:38:30.822
You're the statue girl.

1:38:30.905 --> 1:38:32.282
That wasn't me.

1:38:32.365 --> 1:38:34.326
Yes, it was.
I'm good with faces.

1:38:35.535 --> 1:38:36.703
So, do I have
a wedding to prepare?

1:38:36.786 --> 1:38:38.455
I mean, no pressure,

1:38:38.538 --> 1:38:40.123
but there's an absurd amount
of pastries

1:38:40.206 --> 1:38:41.750
left over from that ball.

1:38:41.833 --> 1:38:43.793
No, no, we're not in a rush
to get married.

1:38:43.877 --> 1:38:45.670
Uh, instead, we're going to
travel the world together.

1:38:45.754 --> 1:38:47.589
Ah. Hmm.

1:38:47.672 --> 1:38:49.090
I'm sorry if
my decision disrupts

1:38:49.174 --> 1:38:50.800
-your plans for succession.
-Well, that's all right.

1:38:50.884 --> 1:38:54.929
It just so happens I share blood
with another who, one day,

1:38:55.013 --> 1:38:57.932
will be the greatest leader
the realm has ever known.

1:38:58.016 --> 1:38:59.768
Hear that, Gwen?

1:39:01.269 --> 1:39:02.812
What's happening?

1:39:02.896 --> 1:39:04.689
-Gwen, my darling girl.
-

1:39:04.773 --> 1:39:09.277
I hereby place you first in line
to inherit the crown, hmm?

1:39:09.361 --> 1:39:10.987
Don't stab me in my sleep.

1:39:12.322 --> 1:39:14.741
I... shall be king?

1:39:14.824 --> 1:39:15.992
Eh, queen.

1:39:16.076 --> 1:39:18.203
I'll take it.

1:39:18.286 --> 1:39:19.496
Good.

1:39:23.375 --> 1:39:25.877
Just so we're clear,
I'm going to rule the land?

1:39:25.960 --> 1:39:28.129
-Yes.
-Okay.

1:39:29.506 --> 1:39:30.840
And everyone heard that?

1:39:30.924 --> 1:39:32.258
-We did. Yes.
-Yes. -Yeah. Mm-hmm.

1:39:32.342 --> 1:39:34.219
Oh!

1:39:34.302 --> 1:39:36.471
So many ideas!

1:39:36.554 --> 1:39:39.516
Like... Oh, I don't know
where to begin!

1:39:39.599 --> 1:39:41.142
Oh, good.
Can I take this crown off?

1:39:41.226 --> 1:39:42.686
-Yes.
-Shall we have some tea?

1:39:44.104 --> 1:39:45.814
GWEN:
It is my honor

1:39:45.897 --> 1:39:49.275
to guide this kingdom forward
into a new era.

1:39:49.359 --> 1:39:52.320
And to pay my deepest respects
to my brother,

1:39:52.404 --> 1:39:55.156
Prince Robert, and his new...

1:39:56.866 --> 1:39:58.493
What are we calling you?

1:39:58.576 --> 1:40:00.036
Well...

1:40:00.120 --> 1:40:02.163
I mean, we don't have to put
a label on it.

1:40:02.247 --> 1:40:03.873
Just... in love?

1:40:03.957 --> 1:40:05.125
I don't know.

1:40:05.208 --> 1:40:06.918
In love?

1:40:07.001 --> 1:40:08.962
Yeah.

1:40:09.045 --> 1:40:10.797
In love.

1:40:10.880 --> 1:40:13.800
And his new love, Ella!

1:40:26.146 --> 1:40:28.022
Ella.

1:40:28.106 --> 1:40:31.735
I believe this belongs to you.

1:40:31.818 --> 1:40:33.528
My mother's brooch.

1:40:33.611 --> 1:40:35.822
I thought it could inspire you
on your voyage.

1:40:35.905 --> 1:40:37.323
Thank you.

1:40:38.742 --> 1:40:40.577
All right, that's enough mirth.
Celebration's over.

1:40:40.660 --> 1:40:42.370
-Everyone, go home.
-

1:40:42.454 --> 1:40:44.122
-Oh, man.
-Back to work.

1:40:44.205 --> 1:40:45.999
-Come on. Let's go.
-No!

1:40:49.419 --> 1:40:51.212
You're wrong!

1:40:51.296 --> 1:40:54.424
-
