WEBVTT

00:06.098 --> 00:07.933
* You've been lyin' *

00:07.933 --> 00:10.302
By winter of 1955,

00:10.302 --> 00:13.506
America was rapidly changing.

00:13.506 --> 00:15.941
* Little boy blue *

00:15.941 --> 00:19.912
The polio vaccine was
officially approved by the FDA.

00:19.912 --> 00:22.515
A small burger joint
called McDonald's

00:22.515 --> 00:25.351
held its grand
opening in Illinois.

00:25.351 --> 00:28.788
Disneyland is a delight
for all youngsters.

00:28.788 --> 00:31.223
Walt Disney opened
his first theme park

00:31.223 --> 00:32.925
in Anaheim, California.

00:32.925 --> 00:35.428
* Little boy sad *

00:35.428 --> 00:37.497
* Someday baby *

00:37.497 --> 00:39.064
And in Chicago,

00:39.064 --> 00:41.601
we were still
making waves at Playboy.

00:41.601 --> 00:43.903
* ...is gonna give you
lovin' as sweet as me *

00:43.903 --> 00:46.205
In the year since we started
taking our own photos,

00:46.205 --> 00:51.411
we'd begun adding playful
elements to our photoshoots,

00:51.411 --> 00:54.714
hiding things like a tie

00:54.714 --> 00:57.850
or a set of golf clubs,

00:57.850 --> 01:00.586
to imply that a man
was just off camera

01:00.586 --> 01:02.788
and giving our readers
something to look for.

01:02.788 --> 01:06.992
* Someday, baby,
you're gonna find *

01:06.992 --> 01:09.328
* Nobody in the world's
gonna give you lovin'... *

01:09.328 --> 01:12.297
Thanks to our concept
of the girl next door,

01:12.297 --> 01:16.702
readership had exploded
from 70,000 copies a month

01:16.702 --> 01:18.170
in our first issue

01:18.170 --> 01:22.007
to 500,000 a month
by the end of the year,

01:22.007 --> 01:26.378
and with annual sales
reaching $3 million,

01:26.378 --> 01:31.417
I saw an opportunity to
take Playboy even further

01:31.417 --> 01:34.153
by going after
a source of revenue

01:34.153 --> 01:39.124
we'd barely tapped into...
advertising.

01:39.124 --> 01:42.562
**

01:42.562 --> 01:47.700
* Skyliner, skyliner *

01:47.700 --> 01:49.502
* Flying so freely *

01:49.502 --> 01:53.573
After World War II,
Americans got back to work,

01:53.573 --> 01:55.340
and the economy was booming.

01:55.340 --> 01:58.343
* Higher, higher,
ever higher *

01:58.343 --> 02:00.379
* Sunbeams are... *

02:00.379 --> 02:03.649
Suddenly, people had cash
to spend on luxuries

02:03.649 --> 02:08.020
like cars, TVs,
and new appliances,

02:08.020 --> 02:12.525
and they spent a lot,
so major companies

02:12.525 --> 02:14.660
began putting massive
amounts of money,

02:14.660 --> 02:19.031
over $5 billion a year,
into promoting their products.

02:19.031 --> 02:22.568
**

02:27.106 --> 02:30.209
It was the Golden Age
of Advertising.

02:32.111 --> 02:33.946
For most magazines,

02:33.946 --> 02:37.016
advertising is the
largest source of revenue,

02:37.016 --> 02:40.385
and advertisers choose
where to advertise

02:40.385 --> 02:45.725
based on the audience,
the price, and the environment.

02:50.029 --> 02:52.264
**

02:52.264 --> 02:56.001
But Playboy
had a different approach.

02:56.001 --> 02:59.038
We were always, even
in the very beginning

02:59.038 --> 03:00.840
when we needed the money,
very, very tough

03:00.840 --> 03:02.608
in terms of
our advertising policy.

03:02.608 --> 03:05.077
I knew for starters
that if we accepted

03:05.077 --> 03:07.613
the kinds of advertising that
appeared in the pulp magazines,

03:07.613 --> 03:09.815
I would never be
able to turn a magazine

03:09.815 --> 03:12.484
with nudes in it
into a class publication.

03:14.153 --> 03:16.889
I only wanted to run
high-class ads,

03:16.889 --> 03:20.159
ones that would suit
our features and articles.

03:20.159 --> 03:22.427
My dad was very thoughtful

03:22.427 --> 03:25.931
about who he wanted to
advertise in the magazine

03:25.931 --> 03:28.300
because he cared more
about reputation

03:28.300 --> 03:30.636
than he did actually
about the cash on the table.

03:30.636 --> 03:32.938
He didn't want to be
in business with people

03:32.938 --> 03:36.341
that didn't actually
believe in the brand.

03:36.341 --> 03:41.080
But now, with sales of
Playboy at an all-time high,

03:41.080 --> 03:43.248
I knew it was time
to start going after

03:43.248 --> 03:45.517
the big name brands
that I wanted.

03:48.253 --> 03:49.989
Uh, Hef, they're here.

03:49.989 --> 03:51.891
Okay. Stall them
five minutes,

03:51.891 --> 03:53.258
then bring them
up to the studio.

03:53.258 --> 03:55.761
Okay.

03:55.761 --> 03:58.731
Get Victor to meet me
on the second floor. Now.

04:00.666 --> 04:04.737
After months of tracking down
potential advertisers,

04:04.737 --> 04:06.672
we finally got the attention

04:06.672 --> 04:10.075
of one of the most
exclusive brands in town.

04:10.075 --> 04:14.714
All I had to do was convince
them to work with us.

04:16.649 --> 04:20.285
* Every little movement *

04:20.285 --> 04:24.624
* Every little thing
you do *

04:24.624 --> 04:27.259
* Is it sleight of hand *

04:27.259 --> 04:32.531
* That commands my heart
to love you? *

04:32.531 --> 04:36.235
* Every little movement *

04:36.235 --> 04:40.272
* Every
little movement **

04:46.712 --> 04:50.415
**

04:50.415 --> 04:52.652
I'd like you to meet
Vince Tajiri,

04:52.652 --> 04:53.853
our photo department head,

04:53.853 --> 04:56.689
Art Paul, art director,

04:56.689 --> 04:59.859
and this is Victor Lownes,
head of promotions.

04:59.859 --> 05:01.627
Welcome to Playboy.

05:01.627 --> 05:02.828
Thanks very much.

05:02.828 --> 05:05.230
Uh, Hef?

05:05.230 --> 05:07.099
This is Bob from
The Diners' Club.

05:07.099 --> 05:09.234
I'm so sorry to keep
you waiting. Hugh Hefner.

05:11.070 --> 05:12.537
**

05:12.537 --> 05:16.942
In 1955, the first independent
charge card

05:16.942 --> 05:19.712
in the world
was introduced in America.

05:19.712 --> 05:21.881
It was called Diners' Club.

05:23.649 --> 05:26.786
This was before
American Express, Visa,

05:26.786 --> 05:29.955
or MasterCard were
in the credit business,

05:29.955 --> 05:32.958
and Diners' Club members
could use their cards

05:32.958 --> 05:35.594
at some of the best
restaurants in the world.

05:35.594 --> 05:38.798
The card was revolutionary,

05:38.798 --> 05:43.168
and I had a plan to get it
into our magazine.

05:46.205 --> 05:48.007
What do you think
of the studio?

05:48.007 --> 05:51.376
Everything looks great.

05:51.376 --> 05:53.445
As you may know,
Janet here

05:53.445 --> 05:56.882
was the first Playmate
we photographed ourselves.

05:56.882 --> 05:59.418
Photographing
our own models has seen

05:59.418 --> 06:01.721
a real spike in readership.

06:01.721 --> 06:03.455
When they see your ad
on our pages,

06:03.455 --> 06:06.091
I'm predicting they'll
choose to spend their money

06:06.091 --> 06:08.460
using a Diners' Club card.

06:08.460 --> 06:10.930
**

06:13.866 --> 06:17.269
All it took was
one look from Janet

06:17.269 --> 06:19.371
and Diners' Club was in.

06:19.371 --> 06:21.841
**

06:21.841 --> 06:25.410
These advertising guys didn't
want to talk advertising.

06:25.410 --> 06:27.947
They wanted to ask
about the Playmates.

06:27.947 --> 06:29.782
They were fascinated by it,

06:29.782 --> 06:33.986
and we were able to take
advantage of that.

06:33.986 --> 06:35.387
Why don't you come
to my office

06:35.387 --> 06:38.323
and we'll talk
some numbers. Sellers?

06:38.323 --> 06:40.692
Bye, Janet.

06:40.692 --> 06:43.628
**

06:43.628 --> 06:45.197
With Diners' Club on board,

06:45.197 --> 06:49.034
it wasn't long before
other big names followed,

06:49.034 --> 06:52.471
and soon,
Playboy was featuring ads

06:52.471 --> 06:53.773
from Marlboro,

06:53.773 --> 06:55.640
Chanel,

06:55.640 --> 06:57.877
Imperial Whiskey,

06:57.877 --> 07:00.279
and Budweiser.

07:00.279 --> 07:03.783
When we went to see
people like Anheuser-Busch,

07:03.783 --> 07:05.918
we could say to them,
look,

07:05.918 --> 07:07.352
you've got to be
in this magazine.

07:07.352 --> 07:09.388
This magazine reaches
more college men

07:09.388 --> 07:13.058
who are the next
generation's leaders.

07:13.058 --> 07:17.196
That was very influential.

07:17.196 --> 07:18.730
**

07:18.730 --> 07:20.232
Our new stream of revenue

07:20.232 --> 07:22.868
was enough to keep the
business running comfortably...

07:22.868 --> 07:25.237
**

07:25.237 --> 07:29.174
...meaning I could stay focused
on the creative side of things.

07:29.174 --> 07:31.310
**

07:31.310 --> 07:33.946
She looks amazing, Vince.

07:35.547 --> 07:38.383
It's a shame they can't be
this big in the magazine.

07:40.052 --> 07:42.754
Let's put this up
on the board, Vince.

07:49.661 --> 07:53.933
Charlaine had a point.

07:53.933 --> 07:55.734
Here in the office,

07:55.734 --> 07:57.970
the photographs felt
more lifelike.

07:57.970 --> 08:00.339
We started out with
these great proofs,

08:00.339 --> 08:02.541
but then we had to
shrink them down

08:02.541 --> 08:05.177
to fit in our magazine.

08:05.177 --> 08:07.612
I knew there had to be a way

08:07.612 --> 08:11.316
to give our readers
a better experience.

08:15.487 --> 08:17.556
I mean, what are
our options here?

08:17.556 --> 08:21.160
Hef wants a bigger photo,
so, tabloid, am I right?

08:21.160 --> 08:22.494
Are you talking about

08:22.494 --> 08:25.130
making the entire magazine
twice as big?

08:25.130 --> 08:27.099
That means everything
costs twice as much.

08:27.099 --> 08:28.333
What's wrong with that?

08:28.333 --> 08:29.869
We've spent three years

08:29.869 --> 08:31.303
building a bond with
our readers, right?

08:31.303 --> 08:32.504
They like the magazine
the way it is.

08:32.504 --> 08:34.139
Think about the ad sales.

08:34.139 --> 08:35.640
Bigger ads. More money.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.276
There you go, Eldon.
Problem solved.

08:37.276 --> 08:38.710
Look, don't get mad at me
'cause I'm the only one here

08:38.710 --> 08:39.979
willing to tell the truth.

08:39.979 --> 08:41.713
Don't get mad at me
for calling bullshit.

08:43.015 --> 08:46.218
We'll just fold it.

08:53.725 --> 08:55.961
Yeah.

09:04.003 --> 09:07.372
Ladies and gentleman,
the Playboy centerfold.

09:09.174 --> 09:12.277
* Love and affection *

09:12.277 --> 09:15.214
In March of 1956,
we put out

09:15.214 --> 09:18.750
our first issue ever
with a fold-out centerfold

09:18.750 --> 09:20.852
featuring model
Marian Stafford.

09:20.852 --> 09:23.889
* I've got it all
right here for you *

09:23.889 --> 09:25.925
* You needn't be lonely *

09:25.925 --> 09:28.093
The first Playboy
centerfold I ever saw

09:28.093 --> 09:31.463
was probably in fourth
grade at a friend's house.

09:31.463 --> 09:34.066
And it's not just
opening the cover.

09:34.066 --> 09:36.201
That centerfold,
that fold-out

09:36.201 --> 09:39.171
is that tactile experience
of opening something

09:39.171 --> 09:42.141
and revealing something.

09:42.141 --> 09:44.776
It just seemed like
you were opening a door

09:44.776 --> 09:46.745
to a whole other world.

09:46.745 --> 09:50.015
**

09:50.015 --> 09:52.151
It wasn't life-size,

09:52.151 --> 09:53.885
but you have no idea
how many times

09:53.885 --> 09:55.387
I made love
to that centerfold.

09:55.387 --> 09:58.657
It took me there,
visually took me there.

09:58.657 --> 10:01.460
I thought that that girl was
right there in front of me.

10:01.460 --> 10:05.264
The larger centerfolds were
an instant hit with readers

10:05.264 --> 10:08.733
and quickly became
synonymous with our brand.

10:08.733 --> 10:12.537
To this day, when people
hear the word "centerfold,"

10:12.537 --> 10:15.207
they immediately
think of Playboy.

10:17.609 --> 10:19.844
**

10:19.844 --> 10:23.215
Sales and subscriptions
skyrocketed,

10:23.215 --> 10:28.520
and in December 1956,
we hit a milestone

10:28.520 --> 10:34.994
when our third anniversary issue
sold over a million copies.

10:34.994 --> 10:39.898
And after just three years,
Playboy was the number one

10:39.898 --> 10:42.234
men's lifestyle magazine
in America.

10:42.234 --> 10:44.636
We had beaten out Esquire,

10:44.636 --> 10:46.972
the magazine that,
three years earlier,

10:46.972 --> 10:49.708
had refused to give me
a $5 raise.

10:49.708 --> 10:52.577
**

10:57.749 --> 10:59.684
We were doing so well,

10:59.684 --> 11:01.886
I needed to bring on
someone who could focus

11:01.886 --> 11:04.389
on the business side
of the magazine.

11:05.991 --> 11:07.892
So, I turned to
an old friend who knew me

11:07.892 --> 11:14.499
better than any of
the other guys, Bob Preuss.

11:14.499 --> 11:16.668
Balance sheet?
Perfect.

11:18.803 --> 11:22.841
Hef always had someone
that he relied on

11:22.841 --> 11:25.010
to be the business head.

11:25.010 --> 11:27.612
In the early years,
it was Bob Preuss,

11:27.612 --> 11:30.115
who'd been
his college roommate.

11:31.950 --> 11:35.220
Demand for the magazine
was rising every month,

11:35.220 --> 11:39.058
and our staff could
barely keep up.

11:39.058 --> 11:41.826
If we were going to
sustain the quality

11:41.826 --> 11:43.595
our readers expected
from us,

11:43.595 --> 11:46.131
we not only needed
to add more staff

11:46.131 --> 11:50.402
but we also needed
someplace to put them.

11:50.402 --> 11:53.105
**

11:58.477 --> 12:01.446
But we didn't just move
to a new office.

12:01.446 --> 12:05.617
This time,
we got our own building.

12:05.617 --> 12:08.853
**

12:08.853 --> 12:10.689
* The sound of
your footsteps *

12:10.689 --> 12:13.125
Four stories,
30,000 square feet.

12:13.125 --> 12:14.993
* Telling me that
you're near *

12:14.993 --> 12:17.196
Plenty of space for
our newly expanded staff...

12:17.196 --> 12:19.264
* Your soft gentle
motion, babe *

12:19.264 --> 12:20.965
...now over 100 people.

12:20.965 --> 12:22.267
* Brings out a need in me *

12:22.267 --> 12:23.668
* That no one can hear *

12:23.668 --> 12:25.370
* Except in my
midnight confessions *

12:25.370 --> 12:27.539
We spent
a quarter-million dollars

12:27.539 --> 12:30.109
to renovate it
top to bottom.

12:30.109 --> 12:32.444
It might have been
a little indulgent,

12:32.444 --> 12:35.046
but I wanted my team
to have the very best.

12:35.046 --> 12:39.251
* When I say all
the things that I want to *

12:39.251 --> 12:41.120
* I love you *

12:41.120 --> 12:43.655
**

12:47.892 --> 12:50.829
We're in my
executive offices now

12:50.829 --> 12:53.165
on top of
the Playboy building.

12:53.165 --> 12:54.599
It's quite late at night

12:54.599 --> 12:57.202
and my working hours
are kind of strange ones.

12:57.202 --> 12:58.837
I usually begin work
about 1:30

12:58.837 --> 13:00.172
or 2:00 in the afternoon.

13:00.172 --> 13:02.374
I get in half a day
that way with the staff

13:02.374 --> 13:05.377
and things are quite
hectic here during the day

13:05.377 --> 13:08.413
with conferences
and various calls

13:08.413 --> 13:09.681
and things to attend to:

13:09.681 --> 13:11.483
layouts, editorial
matters, etcetera.

13:11.483 --> 13:13.652
Then I go into
the second half of my day

13:13.652 --> 13:16.755
in the evening,
and that's a little quieter.

13:16.755 --> 13:19.158
There's nobody else
here to bother me.

13:19.158 --> 13:22.227
It works out
pretty well that way.

13:25.264 --> 13:27.031
At this point,
I pretty much lived

13:27.031 --> 13:29.067
in the office full-time,

13:29.067 --> 13:32.337
but while my business
was growing,

13:32.337 --> 13:34.239
so was my family.

13:34.239 --> 13:36.708
In the midst of
our mounting success,

13:36.708 --> 13:39.211
Millie gave birth
to our second child,

13:39.211 --> 13:42.013
a boy named David.

13:42.013 --> 13:46.585
But with the magazine
taking up all of my time,

13:46.585 --> 13:48.687
I'll be the first to admit
I wasn't acting

13:48.687 --> 13:52.691
like the type of father
or husband my family needed.

13:52.691 --> 13:54.559
My father wasn't around a lot

13:54.559 --> 13:56.060
when my brother and I
were growing up,

13:56.060 --> 13:59.998
but we would spend Christmas
and birthdays with him,

13:59.998 --> 14:02.334
so I always thought of him,
in hindsight,

14:02.334 --> 14:04.336
as kind of like
a favorite uncle,

14:04.336 --> 14:05.737
someone you were related to

14:05.737 --> 14:07.572
who you knew loved you
but didn't really know

14:07.572 --> 14:09.841
who your friends were or
how your grades were going.

14:09.841 --> 14:13.545
**

14:13.545 --> 14:16.815
It was 24/7 for him,

14:16.815 --> 14:19.884
which is why he did not
really have a family life,

14:19.884 --> 14:22.487
even though he was married
and had two children.

14:22.487 --> 14:26.725
But he was working
night and day.

14:26.725 --> 14:30.595
And that was true
for decades.

14:30.595 --> 14:33.432
**

14:36.668 --> 14:40.104
Arrange a meeting
with everybody just to...

14:40.104 --> 14:42.841
With success came attention,

14:42.841 --> 14:46.177
and in January of '57,
I was invited

14:46.177 --> 14:50.449
to profile Playboy on an
entirely new platform for me,

14:50.449 --> 14:52.817
one that was
quickly becoming

14:52.817 --> 14:56.388
an American obsession...
television.

14:56.388 --> 15:02.394
In 1957, television was
taking the country by storm,

15:02.394 --> 15:05.497
and with only three
networks to choose from,

15:05.497 --> 15:08.600
CBS, NBC, and ABC,

15:08.600 --> 15:10.369
roughly a third
of the country

15:10.369 --> 15:13.772
might be tuned in
to one program.

15:13.772 --> 15:15.340
Good evening,
I'm Mike Wallace.

15:15.340 --> 15:17.075
The show is Night Beat.

15:17.075 --> 15:20.979
Mike Wallace's Night Beat
was a popular talk show

15:20.979 --> 15:23.882
known for addressing
controversial topics,

15:23.882 --> 15:26.818
and I thought it would be
the perfect opportunity

15:26.818 --> 15:29.721
to spread Playboy's message.

15:32.223 --> 15:35.026
But I had never appeared
on TV before,

15:35.026 --> 15:39.831
and I'd be lying if I
said I wasn't nervous.

15:39.831 --> 15:42.834
I knew that Night Beat was
a very hot show in New York,

15:42.834 --> 15:45.337
a show that was getting
a lot of reaction.

15:45.337 --> 15:46.805
I also knew that
it was a tough show

15:46.805 --> 15:49.274
and that he was asking
tough questions.

15:49.274 --> 15:51.676
And I had done
very few interviews,

15:51.676 --> 15:53.512
even for print,
in those days,

15:53.512 --> 15:55.614
because it was the very
early days of the magazine.

15:55.614 --> 15:58.116
A little under four years
ago, a junior copywriter

15:58.116 --> 16:00.585
in Esquire Magazine's
promotion department

16:00.585 --> 16:04.956
quit in a huff after
he was refused a $5 raise.

16:04.956 --> 16:06.090
You ready?

16:06.090 --> 16:07.926
And that refusal
turned out to be

16:07.926 --> 16:09.794
one of the worst decisions
ever made at Esquire

16:09.794 --> 16:11.796
because the name of that
copywriter was Hugh Hefner.

16:11.796 --> 16:13.832
You'll be fine.

16:13.832 --> 16:15.767
He is now the editor-in-chief
of Playboy Magazine,

16:15.767 --> 16:17.268
which claims
to have pushed Esquire

16:17.268 --> 16:18.570
right out of first place.

16:19.938 --> 16:22.741
Hugh, we checked
this month's issue

16:22.741 --> 16:27.712
and found 20 pictures of girls
in various stages of undress.

16:27.712 --> 16:31.750
Now, sir, what's the kick
that you get out of it?

16:31.750 --> 16:33.818
At the time that Playboy
started, and this was one

16:33.818 --> 16:35.920
of the big reasons
for beginning the book,

16:35.920 --> 16:37.922
we felt
there as no magazine

16:37.922 --> 16:40.392
doing a really
successful job

16:40.392 --> 16:44.596
of entertaining the audience
that we're trying to hit.

16:44.596 --> 16:48.199
Let's not hide behind
altruistic motives, Hugh.

16:48.199 --> 16:50.569
Chicago Magazine
quoted you to the effect

16:50.569 --> 16:52.070
that sex will always be

16:52.070 --> 16:53.972
a primary ingredient
of the magazine.

16:53.972 --> 16:56.708
Isn't that really what
you're selling?

16:56.708 --> 17:00.111
Kind of
a high-class dirty book?

17:00.111 --> 17:03.181
Um, well, I don't, uh...

17:03.181 --> 17:07.452
I'd make a pretty, uh,
strong case, uh,

17:07.452 --> 17:09.087
in the feeling
that the magazine,

17:09.087 --> 17:10.755
as far we are concerned,

17:10.755 --> 17:12.891
does not over-emphasize
sex at all.

17:12.891 --> 17:15.193
You think that this really
reflects the tastes

17:15.193 --> 17:18.963
and the standards
of young, male Americans?

17:18.963 --> 17:20.264
Truthfully?

17:20.264 --> 17:22.901
Truthfully, without
any reservation, yes.

17:22.901 --> 17:27.906
When I first did my
interview with Hugh Hefner,

17:27.906 --> 17:30.575
I wasn't just playing
devil's advocate with him.

17:30.575 --> 17:33.111
I thought that he was about
to subvert the republic

17:33.111 --> 17:34.779
with some of the stuff

17:34.779 --> 17:36.648
that he was putting
in Playboy Magazine.

17:36.648 --> 17:39.551
What he was doing,
basically, was, I thought,

17:39.551 --> 17:42.787
vaguely pornographic,
vaguely obscene,

17:42.787 --> 17:45.156
and he was putting
a nice cover on it

17:45.156 --> 17:49.027
by finding interesting
intellectual stuff

17:49.027 --> 17:50.429
to lend a little class

17:50.429 --> 17:53.932
to what was essentially
a trifle tawdry.

17:53.932 --> 17:56.501
When I look at the tape,

17:56.501 --> 17:58.703
I see a very nervous kid

17:58.703 --> 18:00.304
who didn't have
his act together

18:00.304 --> 18:02.441
and was
searching for words.

18:02.441 --> 18:03.975
Mike didn't take me
very seriously.

18:03.975 --> 18:07.011
He said, in between
segments of the show,

18:07.011 --> 18:08.580
that he figured I'd be
doing something else

18:08.580 --> 18:11.683
in five years,
and I was hurt by that

18:11.683 --> 18:13.952
because it suggested to me

18:13.952 --> 18:17.422
that he didn't think
I was sincere.

18:27.532 --> 18:33.404
Mike Wallace had torn me
apart on national television,

18:33.404 --> 18:35.707
and all I could think

18:35.707 --> 18:38.510
was that by appearing
on the show unprepared,

18:38.510 --> 18:42.447
I had done Playboy
more harm than good.

18:44.849 --> 18:47.752
Part and parcel of being
in the public eye is,

18:47.752 --> 18:50.354
people are going to have
something to say about you.

18:50.354 --> 18:53.157
You can either
let it bother you,

18:53.157 --> 18:58.997
or if you are on the right side,
just speak the truth.

19:00.431 --> 19:01.800
I had to do something.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.401
I needed to make it clear

19:03.401 --> 19:04.969
that I was making a magazine

19:04.969 --> 19:08.339
for a sophisticated audience.

19:08.339 --> 19:11.910
The first initial dream
was to try to package

19:11.910 --> 19:14.078
the sort of magazine
for a young urban man

19:14.078 --> 19:16.681
that I would enjoy
if I was a reader,

19:16.681 --> 19:19.951
and the perception didn't go
much further than that.

19:22.286 --> 19:26.390
Once that began,
a time came

19:26.390 --> 19:29.761
when I really began to see

19:29.761 --> 19:34.165
the possibilities
of livin' the life.

19:34.165 --> 19:37.368
**

19:37.368 --> 19:40.572
If I was going to change
people's opinion of Playboy,

19:40.572 --> 19:43.542
I had to put myself
in the spotlight

19:43.542 --> 19:45.176
and show the public

19:45.176 --> 19:47.879
that I wasn't just
some creep peddling sex.

19:47.879 --> 19:51.583
I was the epitome
of a modern gentleman.

19:51.583 --> 19:53.885
**

19:53.885 --> 19:56.020
* Keep on runnin' *

19:56.020 --> 20:00.424
Taking inspiration from famous
figures like Frank Sinatra

20:00.424 --> 20:03.795
and characters
like James Bond,

20:03.795 --> 20:06.765
I changed my look.

20:06.765 --> 20:09.968
* Oh yeah *

20:09.968 --> 20:11.936
* Keep on runnin' *

20:11.936 --> 20:13.538
I started dressing
sharper...

20:13.538 --> 20:15.540
* Runnin' from my arms *

20:15.540 --> 20:19.443
...and I even added a new
accessory to my image, a pipe.

20:19.443 --> 20:21.680
* To make you understand *

20:21.680 --> 20:24.683
For the first time, my photo
was prominently featured

20:24.683 --> 20:27.085
in the pages of Playboy...

20:27.085 --> 20:28.920
* Hey hey hey *

20:28.920 --> 20:31.355
...paired with an article
detailing my interests,

20:31.355 --> 20:34.358
fashion sense,
musical taste...

20:34.358 --> 20:36.427
* Hey hey hey *

20:36.427 --> 20:38.429
...and my rise to success.

20:38.429 --> 20:40.799
* It makes me feel so sad *

20:40.799 --> 20:44.202
He invented the character
and then became the character.

20:44.202 --> 20:47.606
I think, in a lot of ways,
he was surprised

20:47.606 --> 20:50.274
how many American men
responded to that

20:50.274 --> 20:54.979
and wanted to engage in
a lifestyle on that level.

20:54.979 --> 20:57.949
**

20:57.949 --> 21:01.119
In 1959, I was
even asked to appear

21:01.119 --> 21:03.888
in an ad from a Chicago
Mercedes dealership,

21:03.888 --> 21:07.291
promoting their
300 SL convertible.

21:07.291 --> 21:11.229
In Chicago, Hefner
was almost immediately

21:11.229 --> 21:13.431
the biggest
celebrity in town,

21:13.431 --> 21:15.934
but that spread quickly
to the rest of the country.

21:15.934 --> 21:17.468
* Hey hey hey *

21:17.468 --> 21:19.904
* Everyone is talking
about me *

21:19.904 --> 21:21.740
For the next two years,

21:21.740 --> 21:23.074
I started giving interviews

21:23.074 --> 21:24.976
to any publication
that would have me...

21:24.976 --> 21:26.911
* Everyone is
laughing at me *

21:26.911 --> 21:28.246
...and little by little,

21:28.246 --> 21:30.882
I started gaining
national notoriety.

21:30.882 --> 21:32.583
* Keep on runnin' *

21:32.583 --> 21:34.318
**

21:34.318 --> 21:35.954
I literally became
a different person,

21:35.954 --> 21:38.356
and I think
that the commitment

21:38.356 --> 21:41.292
in terms of changing my
lifestyle, that wasn't so tough.

21:41.292 --> 21:43.461
There was already
a fascination with Playboy

21:43.461 --> 21:44.896
as a phenomenon.

21:44.896 --> 21:46.297
It was just a matter

21:46.297 --> 21:47.932
of sort of takin' off
the Clark Kent outfit

21:47.932 --> 21:50.534
and puttin' on the cloak
and flyin' out the window.

21:50.534 --> 21:52.236
**

21:52.236 --> 21:53.938
* Hey hey hey *

21:53.938 --> 21:57.141
* Everyone is talking
about me *

21:57.141 --> 21:59.443
* It makes me feel so sad *

21:59.443 --> 22:01.579
* So keep on runnin' *

22:01.579 --> 22:03.514
**

22:03.514 --> 22:05.316
* Hey hey *

22:05.316 --> 22:08.753
**

22:08.753 --> 22:10.789
With my star on the rise,

22:10.789 --> 22:12.757
all kinds of new
business opportunities

22:12.757 --> 22:16.828
were on the table for me,
and in 1959,

22:16.828 --> 22:18.329
the most intriguing

22:18.329 --> 22:20.765
was from a local television
producer from Chicago

22:20.765 --> 22:22.667
named James McGinn.

22:22.667 --> 22:24.936
**

22:26.805 --> 22:28.439
I want to make
a variety show.

22:28.439 --> 22:31.810
Special guests,
celebrity performers.

22:31.810 --> 22:34.512
Playmates...
dressed, of course.

22:34.512 --> 22:37.015
Who did you have
in mind to host?

22:38.917 --> 22:39.884
You.

22:39.884 --> 22:43.354
You're Mr. Playboy.

22:46.290 --> 22:49.260
**

22:49.260 --> 22:52.063
From Broadway,
from Hollywood...

22:52.063 --> 22:53.998
**

22:53.998 --> 22:56.968
At the end of the '50s,
variety shows

22:56.968 --> 22:58.636
like The Tonight Show,

22:58.636 --> 23:02.373
Sid Caesar's Show of Shows,

23:02.373 --> 23:04.508
and The Ed Sullivan Show

23:04.508 --> 23:07.245
were pulling in
massive ratings.

23:07.245 --> 23:09.213
**

23:12.450 --> 23:15.186
I realized if Playboy
could capture

23:15.186 --> 23:17.655
even a small percentage
of those viewers,

23:17.655 --> 23:22.593
we could extend our brand
far beyond just the magazine.

23:22.593 --> 23:26.898
I think the motivation
for pursuing television

23:26.898 --> 23:30.101
was that it offered
another platform

23:30.101 --> 23:33.371
to share
the brand philosophy.

23:35.439 --> 23:38.943
But even with the backing
of a Chicago TV station,

23:38.943 --> 23:43.014
I knew we faced
tough competition.

23:43.014 --> 23:46.417
If we were going to succeed,

23:46.417 --> 23:48.419
we needed to come up
with a concept

23:48.419 --> 23:51.055
that would really
set us apart.

23:56.327 --> 23:58.096
**

23:58.096 --> 24:00.198
Playboy Magazine
was always about

24:00.198 --> 24:02.200
presenting
a fantasy lifestyle...

24:02.200 --> 24:06.938
beautiful women,
high-end design,

24:06.938 --> 24:09.841
and the latest
in American culture.

24:09.841 --> 24:11.910
I wanted to bring
that experience

24:11.910 --> 24:15.013
to a television audience,
and just like that,

24:15.013 --> 24:17.882
Playboy's Penthouse
was born.

24:17.882 --> 24:19.517
**

24:22.420 --> 24:24.722
The concept of
Playboy's Penthouse

24:24.722 --> 24:27.992
was the magazine
come to life.

24:27.992 --> 24:30.561
It was a show
that was taking place

24:30.561 --> 24:32.163
in Hef's living room,

24:32.163 --> 24:35.366
and Hef was
the host of the party.

24:35.366 --> 24:36.700
**

24:36.700 --> 24:38.602
The show was going to be
a huge undertaking,

24:38.602 --> 24:42.706
so I asked the entire staff
of the magazine to pitch in,

24:42.706 --> 24:48.179
including one of our newest
hires, Dick Rosenzweig.

24:48.179 --> 24:52.951
I began working
for Playboy in 1958.

24:52.951 --> 24:56.020
I was hired as
an advertising trainee.

24:56.020 --> 24:59.490
But then Eldon came to me
and asked me

24:59.490 --> 25:01.692
to be the production
syndication manager

25:01.692 --> 25:03.261
of this new
television show.

25:03.261 --> 25:06.898
Nobody really in our company
was qualified to do that,

25:06.898 --> 25:09.667
but we all chipped in,
as we did in those days,

25:09.667 --> 25:12.236
and did double
and triple duty.

25:16.807 --> 25:19.610
We may have had
an amateur staff

25:19.610 --> 25:21.512
and a tiny budget,

25:21.512 --> 25:24.315
but Playboy's
growing reputation

25:24.315 --> 25:28.887
allowed us to lock in an
incredible show line-up.

25:28.887 --> 25:32.891
Stand-up comedian
Lenny Bruce,

25:32.891 --> 25:35.826
best-selling author
Rona Jaffee,

25:35.826 --> 25:39.830
1958 Playmate of
the Month Joyce Nizarri,

25:39.830 --> 25:41.732
and my personal favorites,

25:41.732 --> 25:46.237
jazz legends Ella Fitzgerald
and Nat King Cole.

25:46.237 --> 25:49.740
I used jazz
throughout the '50s

25:49.740 --> 25:52.776
as a major element
in the magazine.

25:52.776 --> 25:56.780
That music spoke to me
and contained those dreams

25:56.780 --> 25:58.983
that I identified with
so much.

25:58.983 --> 26:01.852
**

26:03.821 --> 26:05.957
We had our lineup complete,

26:05.957 --> 26:08.927
but with just days
before we aired,

26:08.927 --> 26:11.862
we got word that
broadcasters in the South

26:11.862 --> 26:15.299
were threatening
to pull our show.

26:15.299 --> 26:19.503
You have to understand,
this was the late 1950s,

26:19.503 --> 26:22.473
a time of
racial segregation

26:22.473 --> 26:25.409
and growing racist
sentiments in the South.

26:25.409 --> 26:29.513
In 1959,
this is four years

26:29.513 --> 26:32.150
after the Montgomery
bus boycott,

26:32.150 --> 26:34.485
a woman locked up for
sitting in the front of a bus

26:34.485 --> 26:36.587
who paid the same fare
as white people.

26:36.587 --> 26:40.291
In that same season,
rights workers were killed

26:40.291 --> 26:43.461
trying to register
people to vote

26:43.461 --> 26:45.563
and had to beg
the Department of Justice

26:45.563 --> 26:47.265
and the FBI to intervene

26:47.265 --> 26:49.900
during that
very ugly transition

26:49.900 --> 26:53.204
from slavery to
Jim Crow desegregation.

26:53.204 --> 26:58.442
It was a very violent season
of fear and polarization.

26:58.442 --> 27:00.711
Protests on both sides

27:00.711 --> 27:04.182
were breaking out
across the country,

27:04.182 --> 27:06.617
and with our program
planning to show

27:06.617 --> 27:08.652
white and black people
socializing,

27:08.652 --> 27:14.058
Southern television stations
were outraged.

27:14.058 --> 27:16.961
So either we pull Nat
and Ella or they pull us?

27:16.961 --> 27:18.496
Pretty much.

27:18.496 --> 27:21.732
Look, gentlemen, we cannot
afford to lose the South.

27:21.732 --> 27:23.567
That's half our audience.

27:23.567 --> 27:25.403
The stations have
all the power.

27:25.403 --> 27:28.672
Fuck the stations.
It's censorship.

27:28.672 --> 27:30.975
Nat King Cole stays
and so does everyone else.

27:30.975 --> 27:32.643
We're making the show
I want to make,

27:32.643 --> 27:35.046
and if the South pulls us,
they pull us.

27:37.148 --> 27:40.551
We start taping
tomorrow night.

27:40.551 --> 27:43.587
People who were not old enough

27:43.587 --> 27:47.125
to be around back then
and see those Playboy shows

27:47.125 --> 27:50.561
would probably see
nothing wrong with them.

27:50.561 --> 27:54.532
Why not have black artists
and black musicians

27:54.532 --> 27:57.535
and black comedians
and black guests?

27:57.535 --> 28:04.175
But in the '50s, that
was very much a red flag

28:04.175 --> 28:07.045
to certain people
and even stations

28:07.045 --> 28:09.347
in certain parts
of this country,

28:09.347 --> 28:15.219
and Hefner's intentional
ability to break that barrier

28:15.219 --> 28:17.655
was really a public service
on his part

28:17.655 --> 28:19.023
and rather daring.

28:19.023 --> 28:23.527
**

28:27.731 --> 28:33.171
On October 24th, 1959,
we premiered

28:33.171 --> 28:37.408
our first episode
of Playboy's Penthouse,

28:37.408 --> 28:40.311
and sadly,
the Southern stations

28:40.311 --> 28:45.816
stuck to their guns
and refused to air it.

28:45.816 --> 28:51.222
But we had made something
I was truly proud of.

28:52.823 --> 28:56.094
I'll admit, I was nervous
to be the frontman

28:56.094 --> 28:57.795
on a brand-new
television show,

28:57.795 --> 29:02.233
but I was excited
to see my vision on TV.

29:05.136 --> 29:08.839
Hello there. Glad you could
join us this evening.

29:08.839 --> 29:10.374
I'm Hugh Hefner,

29:10.374 --> 29:12.276
editor/publisher
of Playboy Magazine,

29:12.276 --> 29:13.544
and your host.

29:13.544 --> 29:15.613
This is Playboy's Penthouse.

29:15.613 --> 29:18.149
Come on in and meet
some of our guests.

29:18.149 --> 29:21.185
Well, here we have
Eleanor Bradley

29:21.185 --> 29:22.686
and Ms. Joyce Nazarri,

29:22.686 --> 29:24.788
two of our
most popular Playmates,

29:24.788 --> 29:26.724
and Lenny Bruce,

29:26.724 --> 29:29.827
foremost exponent
of sick humor and...

29:29.827 --> 29:31.862
Oh!

29:31.862 --> 29:33.331
Isn't that sick?

29:33.331 --> 29:34.932
Oh, boy,
the champagne is really

29:34.932 --> 29:37.201
making my nose bubbly,
Uncle Hugh.

29:39.637 --> 29:42.673
Nat, what a surprise!
Great.

29:42.673 --> 29:44.375
I'm very pleased you could
come up this evening.

29:44.375 --> 29:45.976
- Thank you.
- Come on in.

29:45.976 --> 29:47.878
I was proud to feature
Nat King Cole

29:47.878 --> 29:52.015
and Ella Fitzgerald as
two of our first guests.

29:52.015 --> 29:53.251
Thank you.

29:53.251 --> 29:57.087
Nat, this is Spec,
A.C. Spectorsky.

29:57.087 --> 30:01.625
They represented the best
in American jazz,

30:01.625 --> 30:04.995
and our show wouldn't have
been complete without them.

30:04.995 --> 30:08.866
These were very
talented professionals

30:08.866 --> 30:12.570
in their line of work, jazz,

30:12.570 --> 30:18.142
and Hefner has always felt
that it was right and proper

30:18.142 --> 30:20.811
to have the most talented

30:20.811 --> 30:22.946
and interesting people
on this show.

30:22.946 --> 30:24.682
It's great having you
with us, Ella.

30:24.682 --> 30:26.850
A real pleasure, as always.

30:26.850 --> 30:28.386
The group is here,

30:28.386 --> 30:29.987
and I wonder if you'd
sing a song for us.

30:29.987 --> 30:32.423
Well, we can try and
do something for you.

30:32.423 --> 30:34.592
It was so cleverly
filmed and photographed

30:34.592 --> 30:36.694
because it was
a subjective camera.

30:36.694 --> 30:41.265
You were the audience
walking into that penthouse.

30:41.265 --> 30:43.634
You were watching them.

30:43.634 --> 30:45.436
You felt like you
were there with them.

30:45.436 --> 30:46.770
And that's when I think Hef

30:46.770 --> 30:49.407
started being a kind
of living, breathing

30:49.407 --> 30:51.309
visual interpretation

30:51.309 --> 30:55.112
of that man that
you're reading about.

30:55.112 --> 30:57.681
It was exactly what
I had envisioned.

30:57.681 --> 30:59.483
It was hip, fun,

30:59.483 --> 31:01.985
and thanks to
our featured Playmates,

31:01.985 --> 31:04.488
it was also sexy.

31:04.488 --> 31:06.156
I saw it as
a chance for Playboy

31:06.156 --> 31:08.091
to become bigger
than just a magazine.

31:08.091 --> 31:10.728
* Bring another drink *

31:10.728 --> 31:14.565
But without the South,
there was no guarantee

31:14.565 --> 31:16.166
that we'd pull in
enough viewers

31:16.166 --> 31:18.769
to keep the show on the air.

31:18.769 --> 31:20.871
There were a few people
who had the courage

31:20.871 --> 31:22.906
of their convictions
to stand with us.

31:22.906 --> 31:25.042
Hefner's money and
reputation was on the line.

31:25.042 --> 31:28.846
He identified unequivocally
with social justice

31:28.846 --> 31:31.782
and with the civil rights
movement of that time.

31:48.432 --> 31:50.167
The ratings data came in,

31:50.167 --> 31:53.804
and I wanted you to
hear it from me first.

31:53.804 --> 31:55.939
Is it good or bad?

31:58.208 --> 32:01.445
They want to make
a 26-week commitment.

32:01.445 --> 32:03.714
- Really?
- Yeah.

32:03.714 --> 32:05.283
They're even asking
about a second season.

32:05.283 --> 32:06.317
A second...

32:06.317 --> 32:08.652
Congratulations,
Mr. Playboy.

32:10.087 --> 32:11.722
Even without the South,

32:11.722 --> 32:15.959
the response was better
than I had expected.

32:15.959 --> 32:17.461
**

32:17.461 --> 32:19.162
The civil rights movement

32:19.162 --> 32:21.131
has a particularly
profound effect

32:21.131 --> 32:22.733
on the younger generation

32:22.733 --> 32:26.870
and on those who want to see
themselves as hip and cool.

32:26.870 --> 32:30.040
It is no longer cool
and hip to be racist.

32:30.040 --> 32:33.477
And Hugh Hefner
latches onto that notion.

32:33.477 --> 32:36.347
He feels it.

32:36.347 --> 32:38.215
**

32:38.215 --> 32:41.985
Papers across the country
were talking about us.

32:41.985 --> 32:45.323
The show was a hit,

32:45.323 --> 32:48.959
and we went on to book
even bigger names.

32:50.561 --> 32:52.330
If he does that again,

32:52.330 --> 32:53.997
I'll punch him
a shot in the mouth.

32:53.997 --> 32:56.434
Sammy Davis was a big visitor,

32:56.434 --> 32:57.901
as was Tony Bennett...

32:57.901 --> 32:59.937
Tony's gonna wail
a little bit here.

32:59.937 --> 33:03.507
...who was a great friend
to playboy Cy Coleman,

33:03.507 --> 33:05.643
so it was just a litany

33:05.643 --> 33:08.712
of who the cream
of the crop was

33:08.712 --> 33:10.948
in entertainment
at that time.

33:10.948 --> 33:13.351
**

33:19.256 --> 33:22.125
The success of
Playboy's Penthouse

33:22.125 --> 33:23.727
only solidified our status

33:23.727 --> 33:26.530
as the top-selling men's
magazine in the country.

33:26.530 --> 33:28.466
Let's go for two.
Thanks.

33:28.466 --> 33:31.402
We had a guaranteed circulation

33:31.402 --> 33:34.705
of over a million copies
per month,

33:34.705 --> 33:39.943
and I was now running a company
worth over $20 million.

33:42.613 --> 33:46.249
This is Donna Lynn,
our Playmate for November,

33:46.249 --> 33:48.952
and if Donna doesn't look
exactly like a waitress...

33:48.952 --> 33:51.054
But while my business
was going great...

33:51.054 --> 33:52.690
...that's because
in Hollywood,

33:52.690 --> 33:54.291
the scene is
a little different.

33:54.291 --> 33:56.594
...not everything in my life
was perfect.

33:56.594 --> 33:59.530
...pretty special things,
and we thought Donna

33:59.530 --> 34:01.799
was pretty special,
even by those standards.

34:01.799 --> 34:05.235
Hef invents the idea
of the modern bachelor

34:05.235 --> 34:08.606
without really knowing if
that person actually exists

34:08.606 --> 34:10.841
other than himself,
and to tell you the truth,

34:10.841 --> 34:12.543
he wasn't even that person.

34:12.543 --> 34:15.278
He was married
and living in Chicago.

34:15.278 --> 34:18.649
We'll break for just a minute
and we'll be right back.

34:20.250 --> 34:22.720
I wasn't seeing him that much.

34:22.720 --> 34:26.824
We would do the holidays,
the family days, together,

34:26.824 --> 34:29.827
but we weren't acting
together as a couple.

34:29.827 --> 34:34.465
He lived his own life.
He didn't do it to be cruel.

34:34.465 --> 34:37.535
It hurt, but it wasn't
a deliberate cruelness.

34:37.535 --> 34:39.770
I always respected him,

34:39.770 --> 34:41.772
and I think he always
respected me.

34:41.772 --> 34:44.408
I think we recognized
that we were dissimilar.

34:44.408 --> 34:46.810
We were dissimilar.
And what I wanted,

34:46.810 --> 34:49.980
if I were in a marriage,
what I wanted from it

34:49.980 --> 34:51.649
is something
he couldn't give me.

35:04.528 --> 35:09.066
After a decade of marriage,
Millie and I decided

35:09.066 --> 35:13.837
that the best thing for
both of us was a divorce.

35:19.877 --> 35:21.912
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

35:24.381 --> 35:26.950
I believed, initially,
that marriage

35:26.950 --> 35:32.289
would be the answer
to my romantic dreams,

35:32.289 --> 35:34.191
and it wasn't.

35:36.894 --> 35:42.933
And I think that that
hurt and disappointment

35:42.933 --> 35:47.705
led me in another direction.

35:54.244 --> 35:59.116
Now that I was on my own,
nothing was stopping me

35:59.116 --> 36:03.353
from fully embracing
the Playboy lifestyle.

36:03.353 --> 36:09.459
So I did what every guy in
his thirties dreams of doing.

36:09.459 --> 36:13.163
I bought a bachelor pad.

36:13.163 --> 36:14.932
**

36:18.802 --> 36:21.038
* Sometimes your love *

36:21.038 --> 36:23.807
The four-story,
40-bedroom house

36:23.807 --> 36:25.876
was in the heart
of Chicago.

36:25.876 --> 36:31.414
I dropped $400,000,
or about 3.2 million today.

36:31.414 --> 36:33.951
* Sometimes your love *

36:33.951 --> 36:36.353
And if you think
that sounds like a lot,

36:36.353 --> 36:41.224
I spent another ten times that

36:41.224 --> 36:43.761
on renovations.

36:43.761 --> 36:48.866
And let me tell you,
it was worth every penny.

36:48.866 --> 36:50.634
* Is just like honey *

36:50.634 --> 36:54.171
The main room is,
of course, my favorite.

36:54.171 --> 36:59.142
It has woodwork in it
and a size and magnificence

36:59.142 --> 37:02.546
that you rarely
find in America today.

37:02.546 --> 37:04.648
It looks more as though it
belongs

37:04.648 --> 37:06.216
on an English countryside

37:06.216 --> 37:09.920
than in the heart of
Chicago's near northside.

37:09.920 --> 37:11.655
**

37:11.655 --> 37:14.558
The hi-fi here in
the middle of the room

37:14.558 --> 37:17.828
was custom-built
for the house,

37:17.828 --> 37:19.863
and down below
the main room,

37:19.863 --> 37:22.666
we have the swimming pool.

37:22.666 --> 37:25.703
It's kind of like walking
into a part of Acapulco,

37:25.703 --> 37:27.137
I guess you might say.

37:27.137 --> 37:29.006
There are palm trees
there and a waterfall.

37:29.006 --> 37:32.275
* You got a funny little way *

37:32.275 --> 37:35.378
Hef had a pool
in his living room,

37:35.378 --> 37:37.080
but Hef didn't swim.

37:37.080 --> 37:40.417
Hef had the finest wine,
but he doesn't drink.

37:40.417 --> 37:42.953
He's the greatest host ever.

37:42.953 --> 37:45.455
It was about
other people's pleasure,

37:45.455 --> 37:47.925
for other people to enjoy.

37:47.925 --> 37:49.693
In addition to housing

37:49.693 --> 37:52.863
Chicago's only private
indoor swimming pool,

37:52.863 --> 37:56.667
my mansion was fitted
with the latest technology,

37:56.667 --> 38:01.939
plus a bowling alley,
hidden walkways,

38:01.939 --> 38:07.410
a movie theater,
and a full catering kitchen.

38:07.410 --> 38:09.512
* You got a funny little way *

38:09.512 --> 38:11.615
This house in Chicago
was amazing.

38:11.615 --> 38:14.051
Me and Peter Boyle,
we started looking

38:14.051 --> 38:16.353
all around the place,
and we found ourselves

38:16.353 --> 38:19.222
in a swimming pool
on the second floor.

38:19.222 --> 38:22.259
And there was this one place
where you slid down a pole

38:22.259 --> 38:24.494
and you got into
this pillowed room

38:24.494 --> 38:27.397
that had a glass front
and that was the pool.

38:27.397 --> 38:30.768
* Makes me feel all right *

38:30.768 --> 38:35.272
But the most legendary room
of all was my master bedroom.

38:35.272 --> 38:39.209
I designed it to look like
something out of a Bond movie,

38:39.209 --> 38:43.080
and the centerpiece
was a circular, rotating bed.

38:43.080 --> 38:44.782
And the point of this,
of course,

38:44.782 --> 38:47.050
is not simply
a merry-go-round.

38:47.050 --> 38:48.786
It's really turned
the room itself

38:48.786 --> 38:50.888
into four separate
living sections

38:50.888 --> 38:53.423
so that I can have it
facing the hi-fi area,

38:53.423 --> 38:56.159
facing the TV over here,

38:56.159 --> 38:58.929
or for the work service
or the fireplace.

38:58.929 --> 39:00.931
* Yeah, and it makes me
feel all right *

39:00.931 --> 39:05.535
I'd transformed the mansion
into a bachelor's paradise,

39:05.535 --> 39:08.471
and in December of 1961,

39:08.471 --> 39:12.575
I published a ten-page
spread in the magazine

39:12.575 --> 39:16.847
that gave my readers
an inside look.

39:16.847 --> 39:18.982
* Sometimes your love *

39:18.982 --> 39:20.583
Every decision
that my dad made

39:20.583 --> 39:22.085
was about fostering
the brand,

39:22.085 --> 39:25.255
so the mansion
in Chicago was a reflection

39:25.255 --> 39:27.657
of the brand's values,
which were his values.

39:27.657 --> 39:31.228
It was a place where you
could have a really good time

39:31.228 --> 39:35.498
but still find intellectual
conversation if you wanted to.

39:35.498 --> 39:37.500
It was an adult playground.

39:37.500 --> 39:39.837
* That's why I don't want *

39:39.837 --> 39:41.338
* No other lover *

39:41.338 --> 39:43.741
With the introduction
of the mansion,

39:43.741 --> 39:46.576
I literally got out
from behind the desk

39:46.576 --> 39:49.412
and then it was party time.

39:49.412 --> 39:52.215
* I said honey child *

39:52.215 --> 39:55.185
**

39:57.220 --> 40:01.324
* Quiet nights
of quiet stars *

40:01.324 --> 40:04.427
What had started out
as my home

40:04.427 --> 40:09.366
had now become
the hottest spot in Chicago.

40:11.368 --> 40:14.704
I spent money
and invested money

40:14.704 --> 40:17.908
in the future of this magazine
and company and this dream

40:17.908 --> 40:22.079
in a way that made
no kind of business sense.

40:24.014 --> 40:26.083
All reason and logic
were gone,

40:26.083 --> 40:30.653
and everything
I touched turned into gold.

40:30.653 --> 40:33.323
**

40:46.804 --> 40:51.208
I was living the life
I'd always dreamed of,

40:51.208 --> 40:57.147
and I'd finally become
the ultimate bachelor.

40:57.147 --> 40:59.316
**

41:04.988 --> 41:08.892
* Every little movement *

41:08.892 --> 41:13.196
* Every motion
of your hips *

41:13.196 --> 41:16.333
* I feel the compulsion *

41:16.333 --> 41:21.338
* To pull you
to my sweet lips *

41:21.338 --> 41:29.279
* Is it a black magic spell
you put me under? *

41:29.279 --> 41:32.916
* This miracle moment *

41:32.916 --> 41:37.020
* Never let it end *

41:37.020 --> 41:40.891
* Every little movement *

41:40.891 --> 41:44.862
* Is beyond improvement *

41:44.862 --> 41:47.664
* You are the magician *

41:47.664 --> 41:52.903
* I've been wishing for
forever *

41:52.903 --> 41:56.506
* Every little movement *

41:56.506 --> 42:01.111
* Every
little movement **
