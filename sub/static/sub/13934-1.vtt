01:37.831 --> 01:38.820
What is that?

01:39.799 --> 01:41.699
It's that famous picture
of the monster.

01:42.035 --> 01:43.195
But it's fake.

01:43.403 --> 01:45.871
How do you know it's fake?
It looks real.

01:46.139 --> 01:48.505
Oh, it's fake all right.

01:48.741 --> 01:51.107
Of course it's fake,
everyone knows that.

01:51.911 --> 01:56.678
Wait now, son. There's more
to that photo than meets the eye.

01:57.117 --> 02:00.450
-Oh, really?
-If you'd like to know the real truth....

02:00.720 --> 02:02.347
Yeah. I wanna know.

02:02.555 --> 02:04.113
-Come on. It'll be fun.
-Come on.

02:04.324 --> 02:09.523
Well, you have to go back
to World War ll.

02:09.896 --> 02:13.263
The Germans had captured
the rest of Europe...

02:13.466 --> 02:18.460
...and were only a hundred miles or so
from these shores.

02:19.305 --> 02:21.933
And you need to know
about a young lad...

02:22.142 --> 02:25.669
...called Angus MacMorrow.

02:26.546 --> 02:30.073
The wee lad was drawn to water...

02:30.283 --> 02:34.652
...but deathly afraid of it
at the same time.

04:29.669 --> 04:31.466
You know something, Angus?

04:31.671 --> 04:36.233
The tide pool
is a very strange, enchanted place.

04:38.911 --> 04:41.345
See these wee beauties?

04:42.348 --> 04:46.580
Now, they are full of luck and magic.

04:46.786 --> 04:48.515
-No!
-Aye, Angus.

04:49.188 --> 04:52.351
-You best believe it.
-Can I keep it, Daddy?

04:52.892 --> 04:56.191
Aye. But don't tell your Mummy.

04:56.396 --> 04:59.194
She believes things
should stay where they are.

05:23.456 --> 05:24.445
Angus.

05:27.226 --> 05:28.591
Angus.

05:31.931 --> 05:35.423
Angus MacMorrow,
what in heaven's name?

05:35.635 --> 05:38.968
-Sorry. I'm coming.
-Indeed you are.

05:44.143 --> 05:46.441
I thought you'd drowned.

05:53.219 --> 05:55.346
You didn't even get wet.

06:06.632 --> 06:09.328
That piece. Please.

06:10.436 --> 06:12.495
-Thank you.
-Cheerio.

06:19.946 --> 06:21.743
See you, Archie.

06:22.615 --> 06:24.549
I'd say it's going to rain,
Mrs. MacMorrow.

06:24.751 --> 06:27.345
Think you might be right,
Mr. McCowan.

06:32.125 --> 06:36.221
Would you remind me to tell Clyde
to move the cattle to the lower field?

06:57.517 --> 06:59.382
I'll just put my pail in the workshop.

06:59.585 --> 07:02.145
Well, be quick.
You have to help with the tea.

07:07.360 --> 07:08.657
-Clyde.
-Aye.

07:08.861 --> 07:11.352
Can we move the cattle
down to the lower field?

07:11.564 --> 07:14.658
Oh, aye.
I have got nothing better to do.

07:14.867 --> 07:17.768
Mummy. Look what I've got.

07:19.605 --> 07:23.097
-Where'd you get that?
-Every volunteer got four oranges.

07:23.309 --> 07:25.709
I haven't had an orange
in Lord knows how long.

07:25.912 --> 07:28.278
How was the shore?
Did Angus have fun?

07:28.481 --> 07:29.948
Angus, fun?

09:39.412 --> 09:41.471
Angus! Come on in now.

09:41.681 --> 09:44.149
You told me you'd help with the tea.

09:57.630 --> 10:01.031
All the Malay Peninsula
has been overrun.

10:01.233 --> 10:04.259
We are struggling hard
in the Libyan Desert...

10:04.470 --> 10:08.668
...where perhaps another
serious battle will be soon fought.

10:08.874 --> 10:11.434
The whole future of mankind...

10:11.644 --> 10:15.011
...may depend upon our actions
and upon our conduct.

10:15.214 --> 10:20.049
So far we have not failed.
We shall not fail now.

10:20.252 --> 10:24.188
Let us move forward
steadfastly together....

13:09.455 --> 13:11.218
Jings.

13:26.238 --> 13:29.435
It's all right. There, there.

14:02.608 --> 14:05.668
Here you go. Come on.

14:06.812 --> 14:08.404
That's it.

14:17.189 --> 14:20.124
Come on. Come on.

14:23.062 --> 14:24.996
That's it.

14:29.235 --> 14:30.793
All right, then.

14:32.471 --> 14:34.496
That's a good boy.

14:38.010 --> 14:40.103
It's all right.

14:51.824 --> 14:53.018
Oh, no.

15:12.544 --> 15:13.875
There you are.

15:19.551 --> 15:23.544
It's all right. I'll take care of you.

15:24.089 --> 15:25.078
Angus.

15:26.992 --> 15:30.325
Angus? Angus, it's bedtime.

15:30.529 --> 15:33.020
How many times
do I have to call you?

15:48.514 --> 15:50.345
Crikey.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.589
Get a move on!

16:11.570 --> 16:13.299
What is it?

16:14.473 --> 16:16.907
Maybe Daddy's with them.

16:24.216 --> 16:26.013
Pull up, lads.

16:31.623 --> 16:34.490
-Do you know anything about this?
-No.

16:35.227 --> 16:38.196
-They've got to be here for a reason.
-I don't know.

16:44.603 --> 16:46.332
Excuse me, sir.

16:48.107 --> 16:49.267
Good morning, madam.

16:49.475 --> 16:52.535
Captain Thomas Hamilton,
12 Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery.

16:52.745 --> 16:53.769
Are we all set?

16:55.414 --> 16:58.645
The housekeeper, Mrs. MacMorrow,
is making all the arrangements.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.910
-She is?
-Yes. Is she around?

17:01.120 --> 17:02.451
I'm Anne MacMorrow.

17:03.222 --> 17:04.746
Oh, I beg your pardon.

17:04.957 --> 17:09.189
Clearly, HQ have failed to notify you.
My troop is to be billeted here.

17:09.395 --> 17:11.158
What with?

17:11.363 --> 17:13.228
I've hardly any staff.

17:13.432 --> 17:16.924
When Lord Killin went off to the RAF,
only a few of us stayed on here.

17:17.136 --> 17:19.366
Well, we won't expect afternoon tea.

17:19.571 --> 17:22.472
No, only the officers
will be billeted inside the house.

17:22.674 --> 17:25.370
The rest of my men
will camp outside.

17:26.478 --> 17:29.470
Well, I'm afraid I really would need
Lord Killin's permission.

17:29.681 --> 17:30.670
Of course.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.874
-Wormsley?
-Yes, sir.

17:34.386 --> 17:39.449
From Lord Killin. We're friends,
actually. At Oxford the same year.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.383
All right.

17:42.594 --> 17:46.030
But I have to tell you, our cupboards
are not exactly full these days.

17:46.231 --> 17:49.291
Not to worry. The War Office
keeps us well-supplied.

17:49.501 --> 17:52.868
And what's more, we have a number
of keen hunters in our regiment.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.666
They are trained killers, after all.

17:58.710 --> 18:03.374
You see, Scotland is the front line
in the war these days.

18:04.016 --> 18:05.483
-Sir.
-Good man.

18:05.684 --> 18:08.152
Nazi submarines are everywhere.

18:08.353 --> 18:09.820
Here we are.

18:10.022 --> 18:13.048
Splendid. Yes.

18:15.227 --> 18:16.251
Well, how lovely.

18:17.596 --> 18:20.690
Now all this, you see,
is for your own protection.

18:20.899 --> 18:22.833
-Goldman?
-Well, we're very grateful.

18:23.035 --> 18:25.265
Is this the German advance?

18:25.471 --> 18:28.031
Following the troop movements,
are you?

18:30.576 --> 18:34.239
Don't you worry, son.
We're ready for them.

18:36.348 --> 18:38.816
-Now, you men, come with me.
-Sir.

18:39.017 --> 18:41.349
Can you put my desk over here?

18:41.653 --> 18:44.383
Kirstie, Angus, run along.

18:44.590 --> 18:48.185
We don't want to distract our guests
from their duties.

18:48.861 --> 18:50.226
Can you keep a secret?

18:50.429 --> 18:53.865
Isn't this exciting?
Soldiers right here in our home.

18:54.066 --> 18:57.297
-Promise me you can keep a secret.
-What are you babbling about?

18:57.503 --> 19:01.803
-You have to swear not to tell Mummy.
-I'll not breathe a word. What is it?

19:03.175 --> 19:04.164
I don't know.

19:36.508 --> 19:40.410
Hey! Those are my daddy's boots.
Let go.

19:45.884 --> 19:48.409
Bad boy. You can't eat them.

19:51.757 --> 19:53.748
But I suppose you are hungry.

20:02.367 --> 20:04.460
What's that? Churchill.

20:04.670 --> 20:06.194
That's enough, Churchill.

20:06.405 --> 20:08.498
-Who are you?
-Sergeant Wallace Strunk.

20:08.707 --> 20:12.143
Twelve Medium Regiment, Royal
Artillery. First battery cook.

20:12.344 --> 20:13.971
Churchill, regiment mascot.

20:16.915 --> 20:19.907
-Unauthorized personnel.
-I just wanted a wee snack.

20:20.118 --> 20:22.746
Provisions dispensed
only by written orders in triplicate.

20:22.955 --> 20:24.752
Do you have the paperwork?

20:25.524 --> 20:27.082
Then off you go.

20:27.292 --> 20:31.729
Who's Daddy's boy, then, eh?
Good boy. Good Churchill.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.392
-You're still here?
-I take out the rubbish.

20:34.600 --> 20:35.862
On the double, then.

20:37.469 --> 20:41.428
Who's the best little soldier in the
regiment, then? It's my Churchill.

20:41.640 --> 20:44.973
Good boy. Give me a kiss.
Give me another kiss.

20:55.854 --> 20:57.185
Hello?

20:57.389 --> 20:59.380
Where are you, boy?

21:03.795 --> 21:05.854
Where are you hiding?

21:12.838 --> 21:16.069
You are a sneaky devil,
aren't you, boy?

21:16.375 --> 21:17.740
If you are a boy.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.268
What can we call you?

21:31.456 --> 21:34.550
Crusoe. Trapped on an island.

21:35.494 --> 21:38.657
Right, then, Crusoe.
Let's see what you are.

21:52.277 --> 21:53.767
No.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.475
No.

22:05.123 --> 22:06.647
There you are.

22:11.363 --> 22:12.921
Maybe you're a mammal.

22:21.473 --> 22:23.532
Where were you born, Daddy?

22:23.742 --> 22:27.337
I was born and brought up
on the banks of Loch Morar.

22:27.813 --> 22:32.580
People whispered about a beastie
living in that very loch.

22:32.918 --> 22:37.321
Now, always there've been tales
of sightings of such a creature...

22:37.522 --> 22:41.891
...sometimes at sea,
but more often in a loch.

22:42.894 --> 22:44.794
When I was a boy...

22:45.330 --> 22:48.026
...how I longed to see that monster.

22:49.401 --> 22:51.869
When I was a boy...

22:53.171 --> 22:55.469
...terrible times they were.

22:55.674 --> 22:58.666
Boys and girls, wives and mothers
all over the world...

22:58.877 --> 23:00.845
...left without the man of the house.

23:01.913 --> 23:07.749
They all went off to war,
and many never came back.

23:08.687 --> 23:11.884
We're a tiny village
in the wilds of Scotland...

23:12.090 --> 23:14.786
...but 20 men we lost.

23:15.193 --> 23:17.286
But maybe I'm boring you
with my story.

23:18.196 --> 23:20.494
No. No, please. Don't stop.

23:20.966 --> 23:23.298
Okay, if you insist.

23:24.102 --> 23:27.094
Angus was just like
every other wee boy.

23:27.305 --> 23:30.138
He wanted his daddy home again.

23:31.443 --> 23:35.504
But he also had another problem.

23:37.416 --> 23:41.045
Crusoe, you ate it all.
Come out. You'll be sick.

23:50.695 --> 23:54.825
That's a good boy.
I'm sorry for grabbing.

23:56.001 --> 23:57.866
You're all dried up.

24:14.419 --> 24:15.909
You'll like this.

24:20.625 --> 24:21.887
That's better, eh?

24:26.465 --> 24:28.626
-Look at that.
-Oh, yeah.

24:28.834 --> 24:31.894
Go in there.
Oh, another five-pounder.

24:32.103 --> 24:33.661
Oh, you beauty.

24:33.872 --> 24:36.636
-Aye.
-That takes care of my lunch.

24:51.056 --> 24:52.785
What are they doing
up on that hill?

24:53.859 --> 24:56.453
It's a secret mission.
They're after submarines.

24:56.661 --> 24:59.459
Well, if it's secret,
how do you know about it?

24:59.664 --> 25:02.030
-I have my ways, my contacts.
-Aye.

25:02.234 --> 25:06.227
Well, make contact with them oars.
Pull us over some more fish.

25:18.116 --> 25:20.710
Right. Salute.

25:22.254 --> 25:23.721
Down.

25:23.922 --> 25:25.685
Map, sir?

25:32.063 --> 25:35.658
-Perfect.
-It's an amazing view, sir.

25:36.735 --> 25:41.536
HMS Royal Oak was lost
to a German U-boat in Scapa Flow...

25:41.740 --> 25:43.765
...not a hundred miles from this spot.

25:44.509 --> 25:46.977
Eight hundred and thirty-three
sailors lost.

25:48.847 --> 25:50.906
We're not here for the scenery,
Wormsley.

25:51.116 --> 25:52.640
Yes, sir.

25:54.586 --> 25:56.713
Now, make no mistake...

25:57.822 --> 25:59.813
...we are on the front line here.

26:00.525 --> 26:04.154
Now, I have studied
the German advance.

26:04.429 --> 26:08.331
If they invade,
they will come right through here.

26:08.934 --> 26:12.199
This is the deepest loch in Scotland,
perfect for their troopships.

26:12.404 --> 26:15.271
But they will send submarines first
for reconnaissance.

26:15.473 --> 26:17.566
Won't the steel net stop them, sir?

26:18.743 --> 26:20.233
The submarine net will be down...

26:20.912 --> 26:24.143
...to permit passage
by routine marine traffic...

26:24.349 --> 26:26.681
...and to let their subs in.

26:27.986 --> 26:30.454
And then we will raise the net...

26:31.823 --> 26:33.950
...and we will destroy them.

26:42.100 --> 26:46.400
I wish I could swim like you.
I wish I wasn't so afraid.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.869
Come on! Stop!

26:50.475 --> 26:52.670
What the hell
you think you're doing?

26:54.412 --> 26:56.175
-What's going on?
-Keep your hands off!

26:56.381 --> 26:57.780
You're not fit to touch it.

26:57.983 --> 26:59.473
Oh, no.

26:59.684 --> 27:02.619
I better go. Stay out of trouble.

27:08.393 --> 27:10.122
Look where you're going.

27:10.328 --> 27:12.660
Where'd you learn to drive,
in the Dodgems?

27:12.864 --> 27:15.924
Look, there's a rear-vision mirror.
Know what that's for?

27:16.134 --> 27:19.535
-That's to look where you're going.
-It was an accident, I assure you.

27:19.738 --> 27:21.865
All right, Clyde. That's enough.

27:22.073 --> 27:23.734
That's a lovely bit of meat there.

27:25.176 --> 27:26.939
Who's this?

27:33.251 --> 27:34.946
There he goes.

27:46.531 --> 27:49.557
Did you see all those jeeps and
lorries going up and down the hill?

27:49.768 --> 27:50.757
You're late.

27:50.969 --> 27:52.800
And that is very hush-hush.

27:53.004 --> 27:56.770
Aye. It's a secret mission,
that's what I hear. Top secret.

27:56.975 --> 27:58.135
I'll say one thing, Jimmy.

27:58.343 --> 28:01.676
If it's a secret, you'd be
the last person to tell about it.

28:01.880 --> 28:04.474
-That's cruel. That's very cruel.
-Aye.

28:10.288 --> 28:11.414
-Evening.
-All right.

28:11.623 --> 28:14.023
-What'll you have?
-Pint of McEwan's.

28:23.535 --> 28:24.695
Looks like rain.

28:26.571 --> 28:28.198
Yeah, it might.

28:28.406 --> 28:31.375
You're not from the village.
Would you be with the artillery?

28:32.277 --> 28:35.713
Here we are, lads.
Our home away from home.

28:36.214 --> 28:39.911
Did you hear the captain today?
"We're on the front lines."

28:40.118 --> 28:41.312
Front line, my aunt.

28:41.519 --> 28:44.420
We're here because his daddy
put him as far away from danger...

28:44.622 --> 28:46.522
...as the War Office could find.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.852
You're the boys
with the big gun up the loch.

28:49.060 --> 28:52.518
-Indeed we are.
-Would that thing sink a submarine?

28:52.731 --> 28:54.665
With one shell.

28:55.300 --> 28:57.495
-What are you having, lads?
-Pint of heavy.

28:57.702 --> 29:00.102
Yeah, I'll have a whiskey.
What you got there?

29:02.741 --> 29:05.539
Recock, fire.

29:05.744 --> 29:08.645
Recock, fire.

29:08.847 --> 29:11.680
Recock, fire.

30:35.700 --> 30:38.066
Angus, we need to talk.

30:42.774 --> 30:44.139
Mrs. MacMorrow?

30:44.943 --> 30:48.572
-Who are you?
-Me name's Lewis Mowbray.

30:49.480 --> 30:51.607
Oh, yes. The handyman.

30:53.518 --> 30:55.645
You're two days late in arriving.

30:56.921 --> 30:58.650
Yes, ma'am.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.222
I....

31:01.292 --> 31:04.659
I was.... I....

31:06.164 --> 31:08.257
Well, you can start
by cleaning this mess.

31:09.968 --> 31:13.563
You can pack up
all these books and shells...

31:13.771 --> 31:16.535
...and charts and so forth.

31:16.975 --> 31:20.934
I want to empty this shop out.
And...

31:21.145 --> 31:23.773
...I think my son has an animal
hidden in here somewhere.

31:23.982 --> 31:25.882
He's not allowed pets, so....

31:26.084 --> 31:29.645
-Do you think you could manage that?
-Aye.

31:32.423 --> 31:34.721
And we'll have no drinking
in our house, Mr. Lewis.

31:35.426 --> 31:38.554
Yes, ma'am. That's--

31:38.763 --> 31:41.061
That's Mowbray, ma'am.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.558
Yes.

32:02.120 --> 32:03.883
Oh, no.

32:04.322 --> 32:07.849
No! No, no! No!

32:08.059 --> 32:11.517
What are you doing?
Why did you empty the barrel?

32:11.729 --> 32:16.723
-Did you see anything fall out of it?
-Only water. What are you looking for?

32:17.268 --> 32:19.828
Nothing.
You'd remember if you'd seen it.

32:20.038 --> 32:22.029
I didn't see anything.

32:22.540 --> 32:24.098
Who are you?

32:24.309 --> 32:26.834
Mrs. MacMorrow hired me
to help her in the lodge.

32:27.045 --> 32:28.774
So this'll be my workshop now.

32:28.980 --> 32:31.380
I don't want you coming in
and out of it. Understand?

32:31.582 --> 32:35.040
This is my father's workshop.
He's off fighting in the war.

32:35.253 --> 32:36.880
-You can't just come in here--
-Lad!

32:37.221 --> 32:39.883
When your father returns,
he can do with it what he wants.

32:40.091 --> 32:42.184
But for now, this shop is mine...

32:42.393 --> 32:44.554
...and I want to be left alone.
Am I clear?

32:45.730 --> 32:47.561
Have I made myself clear?

33:00.678 --> 33:02.339
Crusoe?

33:02.547 --> 33:04.742
Crusoe, come out.

33:04.949 --> 33:07.110
Where are you hiding?

33:07.719 --> 33:09.880
Could I trouble you for a light?

33:14.258 --> 33:15.725
Thank you.

33:19.030 --> 33:21.225
Absolutely stunning countryside,
isn't it?

33:24.869 --> 33:26.564
You from around here?

33:27.205 --> 33:28.934
I'm from Dornoch.

33:29.741 --> 33:31.470
Captain Thomas Hamilton.

33:32.343 --> 33:33.935
Good to meet you.

33:35.380 --> 33:36.438
And yours?

33:39.584 --> 33:41.950
Mowbray. Lewis Mowbray.

33:45.289 --> 33:48.417
And you've seen service, I presume.

33:49.127 --> 33:51.789
Crusoe, please come out.

33:51.996 --> 33:53.930
Come out now.

34:02.373 --> 34:05.399
Well, have a good evening,
Mowbray.

34:07.645 --> 34:10.307
Where are you?
Where have you gone?

34:11.883 --> 34:14.681
Crusoe, where the devil are you?

35:21.819 --> 35:24.014
Sergeant Strunk!

35:28.092 --> 35:29.957
Bad dog, Churchill.

35:30.161 --> 35:33.494
Don't care if you're Lord Chamberlain,
I won't have my kitchen destroyed.

35:33.698 --> 35:37.225
Sorry, ma'am,
I don't know what got into him.

36:04.595 --> 36:07.462
Hush your wheesht, you daft dog!

36:20.811 --> 36:22.938
Crusoe, no!

36:25.016 --> 36:27.484
-Stop. Get back in there.
-No. No, it's horrible.

36:27.685 --> 36:30.449
-He won't hurt you. Believe me.
-It's disgusting.

36:30.655 --> 36:32.520
-He won't hurt you.
-What is it?

36:32.890 --> 36:36.917
I don't know, but it came from an egg.
I tried to tell you.

36:41.499 --> 36:43.694
Jings, Crusoe.

36:43.901 --> 36:45.493
You're as big as a prize pig.

36:46.804 --> 36:49.295
How'd you grow so fast?

36:50.174 --> 36:52.301
I thought I'd lost you.

36:53.010 --> 36:55.706
He's very friendly. Aren't you, boy?

36:55.913 --> 36:57.847
Angus, Mummy will have a fit.

36:58.049 --> 37:01.177
Don't you dare tell her.
Kirstie, please.

37:01.385 --> 37:04.946
He needs me. I'm his only friend.

37:06.457 --> 37:08.482
I saved his life.

37:17.101 --> 37:19.035
The poor wee thing.

37:21.239 --> 37:22.729
You won't tell?

37:22.940 --> 37:26.205
-Swear.
-I don't swear, Angus MacMorrow.

37:26.410 --> 37:28.503
I'll not speak a word.

37:29.046 --> 37:31.640
You're a good sister after all.

37:34.852 --> 37:34.986
Every 10 minutes....

37:34.986 --> 37:36.817
Every 10 minutes....

37:37.888 --> 37:39.583
Good morning, ma'am.

37:42.326 --> 37:45.489
-Lovely morning, miss.
-Morning.

37:51.535 --> 37:53.867
-Oh, God. I'm sorry.
-It's all right. Come in.

37:56.774 --> 37:58.241
Come in.

38:06.951 --> 38:10.079
You've done some very good work
around the grounds, Mr. Lewis.

38:11.389 --> 38:14.916
Thank you, ma'am.
And it's Mowbray, ma'am.

38:16.193 --> 38:17.922
Oh, yes.

38:18.362 --> 38:22.890
Did you know the guest bathroom's
been out of order for three days now?

38:23.100 --> 38:24.897
I'll see to it immediately, ma'am.

38:26.837 --> 38:30.068
I have some clothes. My husband's.

38:30.274 --> 38:33.402
Well, you seem to be about the
same size. Would you care for them?

38:35.680 --> 38:38.240
Well, won't he need them
when he comes home?

38:39.750 --> 38:42.947
He's not coming home,
Mr. Mowbray.

38:43.921 --> 38:47.857
His ship was sunk at sea.
It's been almost a year.

38:51.195 --> 38:54.756
I'm sorry. Sorry.

38:55.132 --> 38:56.497
It's just--

38:56.701 --> 39:00.797
It's just that your son had said that....

39:02.840 --> 39:05.070
Angus is a confused boy.

39:05.643 --> 39:06.769
Confused?

39:09.113 --> 39:10.808
Yes.

39:12.750 --> 39:16.186
I have a lot to do.
Do you want them or not?

39:16.887 --> 39:19.947
Yes. Thank you.

39:22.293 --> 39:24.056
Aye.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.058
Thanks.

39:53.991 --> 39:55.925
Did you have to
turn him into a mummy?

39:56.127 --> 39:58.789
It was getting too loud.
Somebody would've heard.

40:01.532 --> 40:03.625
Quiet, Crusoe!

40:04.735 --> 40:05.724
Who's there?

40:06.704 --> 40:08.296
I'm here to fix the bathroom.

40:08.706 --> 40:11.504
-We're using it.
-What, both of you?

40:11.709 --> 40:13.677
But I thought it was out of order.

40:14.111 --> 40:15.510
What's that noise?

40:17.948 --> 40:19.916
I have a cough.

40:20.718 --> 40:22.743
You got an animal in there?

40:22.953 --> 40:26.411
Look, you better let me in
or your mother will hear about this.

40:26.791 --> 40:28.986
-No.
-Let me in.

40:39.370 --> 40:42.100
Listen, you two, all right?
I have to do my job.

40:42.506 --> 40:45.236
Your mother told me this bathroom
has been out of order--

40:45.443 --> 40:46.705
What-- What is that?

40:48.145 --> 40:52.275
He came from an egg at the tide pool.
His name's Crusoe.

40:58.255 --> 41:00.450
What in the name of--?

41:02.526 --> 41:04.585
He's very friendly.

41:18.509 --> 41:20.704
Mary and Joseph.

41:20.911 --> 41:24.278
-He almost died when he was born.
-Almost took my hand off.

41:24.715 --> 41:26.546
He thinks I'm his father.

41:30.387 --> 41:32.355
I wonder....

41:32.556 --> 41:35.218
-It just can't be.
-Can't be what?

41:35.693 --> 41:38.025
Well, it looks like a....

41:38.929 --> 41:42.126
-Like a bloody water horse.
-A what?

41:43.067 --> 41:46.969
They're make-believe.
A legend from the Celtic past.

41:47.571 --> 41:50.096
They're said to be
the rarest of all creatures.

41:50.307 --> 41:54.607
There can be only one water horse
in the world at a time.

41:55.045 --> 41:59.448
When the one grows old,
it lays a single egg, and then it dies.

41:59.917 --> 42:02.317
-Crusoe's a girl?
-No.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.818
No, lad, he's girl and boy both.

42:05.022 --> 42:07.855
The beast is both mum and dad
to the egg.

42:09.660 --> 42:13.562
The old water horse dies
before the egg hatches...

42:13.764 --> 42:16.927
...so the new water horse
is born an orphan.

42:17.968 --> 42:19.868
Oh, that's sad.

42:23.040 --> 42:25.440
It's an amazing thing though, isn't it?

42:25.643 --> 42:27.838
Angus! Kirstie!

42:28.045 --> 42:30.104
Don't tell her.
She'd make us get rid of it.

42:30.314 --> 42:31.804
Angus?

42:32.416 --> 42:33.815
Will you help us, Mr. Lewis?

42:36.287 --> 42:38.517
You're asking me
to deceive your mother.

42:39.490 --> 42:41.890
Angus? Kirstie?

42:46.330 --> 42:49.788
-What are you doing in there?
-I was helping Mr. Lewis fix the pipes.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.366
Since when have pipes
been an interest of yours?

42:52.903 --> 42:56.634
-Wait! It's a bad time to interrupt him.
-What?

42:56.840 --> 42:59.900
Plumbing is tricky. It's like surgery.

43:00.110 --> 43:02.169
One mistake could mean death.

43:04.682 --> 43:06.547
Mr. Lewis found the problem.

43:12.256 --> 43:14.247
I can explain. He--

43:18.629 --> 43:20.893
Always been handy
with the plumbing.

43:21.265 --> 43:23.062
He's a genius.

43:23.267 --> 43:25.064
And you helped, did you, Angus?

43:25.269 --> 43:26.258
Yes, I--

43:26.470 --> 43:29.234
-I handed the tools.
-And you, Kirstie?

43:29.440 --> 43:32.898
No. I came to get Angus to show him
the civil assistance manual.

43:36.880 --> 43:40.577
It's getting a bit cramped in here,
so off you go. Did a grand job, Angus.

43:41.251 --> 43:43.014
Bye.

43:46.824 --> 43:48.655
It's the pipes.

43:48.859 --> 43:52.761
It's the air locks bubbling through,
you see.

43:53.931 --> 43:55.626
Angus was a great help.

43:56.934 --> 43:58.799
So you said.

43:59.570 --> 44:01.401
Oh, dear. Excuse me. That's--

44:01.605 --> 44:04.540
The doctor warned me
not to eat haggis for breakfast.

44:04.742 --> 44:06.300
So it's something about the...

44:06.677 --> 44:10.909
...texture of the innards mixed in
with the suet that I just can't....

44:11.115 --> 44:14.607
Thank you, thank you. You've
explained that quite enough.

44:17.988 --> 44:23.688
Shut your ugly gob. You bloody near
got me sacked, you wee ingrate.

44:31.735 --> 44:34.602
Captain, we'll have that bathroom
up and running by tonight.

44:34.805 --> 44:36.534
Oh, wonderful.

44:36.840 --> 44:39.468
Would you allow me to organize
a meal tomorrow evening?

44:39.677 --> 44:40.974
As a token of our gratitude.

44:41.178 --> 44:44.079
Just the officers and yourself,
of course, as guest of honor.

44:47.918 --> 44:50.079
Thank you very much.
That'd be very nice.

44:50.454 --> 44:53.184
Excellent. Shall we say 8:00?

44:56.894 --> 44:58.293
What are we going to do?

44:58.495 --> 45:01.157
One thing's sure, you need to
get him out of the house.

45:01.365 --> 45:03.663
-But where can I put him?
-In the loch.

45:03.867 --> 45:06.631
No! I want Crusoe to stay.
He's mine!

45:06.837 --> 45:09.931
But he can't spend his life
in a toilet bowl.

45:10.541 --> 45:12.975
-But he can stay with me.
-Whatever the devil he is...

45:13.177 --> 45:14.872
...he's meant to swim and be free.

45:15.979 --> 45:17.776
The loch is loaded
with salmon to eat...

45:17.981 --> 45:21.212
...and there's plenty of water for him
to grow and move around in.

45:21.418 --> 45:25.184
-You want what's best for him?
-What's best for him is to be with me.

45:51.115 --> 45:54.915
Excuse me, sir. Mrs. MacMorrow.

45:55.552 --> 45:57.645
Anyone for champagne?

46:00.524 --> 46:02.822
-Thank you.
-That was very good, sir.

46:03.927 --> 46:06.953
It was brilliant tonight,
with the last change from the--

46:10.434 --> 46:12.527
Mrs. MacMorrow, you look radiant.

46:13.637 --> 46:16.834
In Scotland
we call that a fib, captain.

46:17.674 --> 46:19.574
Let me introduce you.

46:28.819 --> 46:30.844
I love to watch a man work.

46:36.326 --> 46:39.955
-Go easy.
-Don't we deserve it, eh?

46:52.810 --> 46:54.141
Gentlemen.

46:58.282 --> 47:01.809
The king, the regiment...

47:02.653 --> 47:04.348
...and the lady of the house.

47:04.555 --> 47:09.356
The king, the regiment
and the lady of the house.

47:09.726 --> 47:14.789
Well, gentlemen, technically speaking
I'm not actually the lady of the house...

47:14.998 --> 47:18.559
...but I suppose for tonight
I'm happy enough to serve that role.

47:19.002 --> 47:20.799
-Thank you.
-She's charming.

47:21.305 --> 47:24.103
Here you are. Look what I've got.

47:26.743 --> 47:28.904
Don't be greedy now.

47:35.986 --> 47:39.217
Angus, come quickly.
I've something funny to show you.

47:39.423 --> 47:41.983
I'll be back in a minute, Crusoe.

47:44.695 --> 47:46.458
You're not going to believe this.

47:56.607 --> 47:59.098
You're a fine woman, Gracie.

48:52.763 --> 48:54.526
Gracie!

48:56.033 --> 48:58.297
Oh, my God.
I don't know what came over me.

48:58.502 --> 48:59.594
Just a bit of fun.

49:03.307 --> 49:04.535
Where's the dog?

49:47.217 --> 49:48.275
Oh, no.

50:04.468 --> 50:07.801
Do you know why I take two pairs
of trousers onto the golf course?

50:08.005 --> 50:10.064
In case I get a hole in one.

50:43.673 --> 50:45.664
Did you hear something?

50:46.309 --> 50:49.972
No, no. Maybe this old house
has one or two ghosts, huh?

50:50.180 --> 50:53.638
Oh, I don't believe in such things,
captain.

50:56.453 --> 50:58.853
Come here, you bloody mongrel.

50:59.990 --> 51:01.480
I'm sure I can hear something.

51:01.691 --> 51:03.682
Yes, that time
I distinctly heard something.

51:15.772 --> 51:17.399
Crusoe, no!

51:21.178 --> 51:22.770
What's that now?

51:33.223 --> 51:35.589
Come on, Crusoe! Get out of here!

51:38.762 --> 51:41.424
-Take your hand off me, man.
-Angus, come right back here!

51:47.571 --> 51:49.732
Crusoe, come back!

51:58.615 --> 52:01.709
Mr. Lewis, what in goodness sake?

52:01.918 --> 52:04.614
Sorry, the name's Mowbray, ma'am.

52:04.888 --> 52:06.651
-What?
-Sorry, ma'am.

52:06.857 --> 52:09.257
The dog got loose,
and I was trying to catch him.

52:09.459 --> 52:11.359
I should say you failed at that.

52:13.497 --> 52:16.591
-Yes, ma'am.
-You think it's funny, Mowbray?

52:17.968 --> 52:20.562
No, no. It's a very serious matter.

52:20.770 --> 52:22.738
You hold your tongue, man.

52:22.939 --> 52:26.739
You're not in your stately home now.
I'll not be taking orders from you.

52:27.277 --> 52:28.938
That is quite enough.

52:29.146 --> 52:31.910
Go and collect Angus and
take him to his room immediately.

52:32.115 --> 52:33.776
Yes, ma'am.

53:07.250 --> 53:11.812
Crusoe? Crusoe, come back.
We're all going to get into trouble.

53:12.022 --> 53:14.718
Lewis, we've got to find Crusoe.
He's gone.

53:14.925 --> 53:18.759
Yeah, I know. I'll find the wee devil,
and you go straight to your room.

53:18.962 --> 53:20.520
-But, Lewis--
-Off to bed with you.

53:20.730 --> 53:24.131
Or your mom will have both our hides.
On you go. Go.

53:34.878 --> 53:39.247
Where are you,
you wee, smelly beast?

54:02.739 --> 54:05.503
Angus. Angus.
Angus, wake up. I found him.

54:05.709 --> 54:07.677
Can't we just
put him back in the bathtub?

54:07.877 --> 54:09.742
No. No, I don't think so.

54:12.749 --> 54:14.182
Jings.

54:17.754 --> 54:21.019
Lewis, do you know anything more
about water horses?

54:21.224 --> 54:24.990
I think it was-- Aye, it was my Uncle
Lachlan who first told me about them.

54:25.195 --> 54:27.595
Many years ago,
there was a lost traveler...

54:27.797 --> 54:32.291
...and he's weeping bitter tears
because he cannot find his way home.

54:32.502 --> 54:33.799
He'd given up hope.

54:34.004 --> 54:39.032
Then suddenly, who should appear at
the bank of the loch to this traveler...

54:39.242 --> 54:43.702
...but a sea spirit. A water horse.

54:43.913 --> 54:48.680
The traveler, no fool is he, knows the
water horse is a creature of magic...

54:48.885 --> 54:52.685
...one that could grow
10 feet tall overnight.

54:53.556 --> 54:59.153
So the traveler, he feeds
the water horse, strokes it...

54:59.362 --> 55:03.560
...flatters it with compliments.
And finally the traveler says:

55:03.767 --> 55:07.794
"Incidentally, water horse,
my dear friend...

55:08.004 --> 55:10.939
...I'm wondering, if you've
no other pressing engagements...

55:11.141 --> 55:15.009
...could I trouble you to carry me
across the loch on your back?

55:15.211 --> 55:16.405
Show me the way home?"

55:16.613 --> 55:20.743
Well, what happens?
Does the water horse help him?

55:22.786 --> 55:23.775
I don't remember.

55:24.587 --> 55:27.488
What? Does the water horse
help him or doesn't he?

55:27.691 --> 55:30.683
Well, it was so long ago
that I heard it.

55:31.861 --> 55:35.456
It either carries him across the loch...

55:35.665 --> 55:38.463
...or it drags him down to the bottom
to his watery death.

55:39.969 --> 55:41.766
I'm not sure which.

55:56.720 --> 55:58.915
Here you go, your favorite snack.

56:26.216 --> 56:27.205
Angus, run now!

56:28.918 --> 56:30.715
Angus, run!

56:31.721 --> 56:34.485
Faster. No looking back.

56:51.441 --> 56:53.136
Mowbray.

56:54.244 --> 56:56.371
You're all wet, man.

56:56.579 --> 56:57.841
You been fishing?

56:59.682 --> 57:04.483
No. I went diving, to see all those
submarines you're going to sink.

57:04.687 --> 57:06.678
Oh, you like to mock the war effort,
do you?

57:06.890 --> 57:09.120
No. No, I don't.

57:09.325 --> 57:12.317
Our forces over there in Europe
on the front lines...

57:13.196 --> 57:15.187
...they're doing a great job.

57:17.801 --> 57:20.531
I want you to stay away from young
Angus. Do you understand?

57:20.737 --> 57:22.932
I consider you a bad influence.

57:23.139 --> 57:24.970
Is that so?

57:26.209 --> 57:27.870
I don't know if you're a spy...

57:28.077 --> 57:31.569
...or a deserter,
or just simply a coward, Mowbray.

57:31.781 --> 57:33.510
-But I'm gonna find out.
-Oh, I see.

57:33.716 --> 57:35.581
They took you away from
the battlefront...

57:35.785 --> 57:39.016
...to hunt for deserters and cowards.
Well, I'm neither.

57:39.222 --> 57:41.952
So you can take that
Sassenach attitude of yours...

57:42.158 --> 57:44.353
...back to where you came from.

57:45.829 --> 57:49.424
You stay away from the boy.
Do you understand?

57:57.106 --> 57:58.801
I'll have a bit of breakfast.

58:02.545 --> 58:04.638
Wait, wait.

58:05.014 --> 58:07.244
-How does she feel?
-Oh, respectable.

58:07.450 --> 58:09.543
-It's a nice one.
-Get the net.

58:11.187 --> 58:12.916
You've got a keeper, for sure.

58:17.026 --> 58:19.756
I'd say it's at least a five-pounder.

58:26.135 --> 58:28.899
-Oh, my sainted mother!
-What on earth is it?

58:29.105 --> 58:31.869
-It's a monster.
-It's a big fish, all right.

58:32.075 --> 58:36.637
No, it's a monster,
a creature with horns. A devil!

58:36.846 --> 58:39.644
I told you to stay off that drink
in the morning.

58:41.851 --> 58:44.046
It's a big fish, all right.

58:52.362 --> 58:56.458
-It's gigantic!
-Oh, no!

58:58.368 --> 59:01.929
Cut the line. Mother of God, cut it.

59:02.372 --> 59:07.366
Are you mad? This is the biggest fish
I've ever had on. I'm going to land it.

59:19.088 --> 59:22.990
-It's going to sink us!
-Okay, okay. Cut the line.

59:23.192 --> 59:24.819
Cut the line before he drowns us.

59:25.528 --> 59:28.827
For God's sake, hurry up. Hurry up!

59:43.313 --> 59:45.144
Did you see it?

59:45.982 --> 59:49.383
I saw it. Whatever it is.

59:56.092 --> 59:57.559
Sir.

59:58.595 --> 1:00:03.362
Now, young man, your mother has
asked me to enlist you in service.

1:00:03.566 --> 1:00:07.229
You are completely aimless, and
we're gonna give you some purpose...

1:00:07.437 --> 1:00:09.428
...make a soldier out of you, all right?

1:00:13.910 --> 1:00:16.708
Left! Left, right, left!

1:00:16.913 --> 1:00:18.437
Left, left!

1:00:25.254 --> 1:00:28.849
Come on, lad, hurry up. War'll be over
before you finish that spud.

1:00:33.062 --> 1:00:36.896
That's very good, Angus.
Put your back into it, lad.

1:00:44.107 --> 1:00:45.870
Left, right, left!

1:00:46.075 --> 1:00:50.068
Left, left. Left, right, left!

1:00:57.153 --> 1:01:00.418
Keep peeling. I'll be back.

1:01:09.766 --> 1:01:14.260
Very good. Now, on to the next one.

1:01:17.006 --> 1:01:21.943
I want this vehicle spotless
both inside and out. Right?

1:01:22.145 --> 1:01:24.705
-You understand your orders?
-Yes.

1:01:24.914 --> 1:01:28.179
You're in the army now. We have
a way of addressing officers, don't we?

1:01:28.384 --> 1:01:33.287
-Yes, sir.
-Good man. Well, carry on.

1:01:33.489 --> 1:01:35.548
Now, Edwards.

1:01:35.758 --> 1:01:38.386
We need to lay down
something for you.

1:01:41.264 --> 1:01:45.564
We need to ensure that these grounds
are unaffected by our presence....

1:01:48.871 --> 1:01:50.065
You wally.

1:01:50.273 --> 1:01:52.366
-Right away, sir.
-Carry on.

1:02:23.773 --> 1:02:25.741
Crusoe!

1:02:27.009 --> 1:02:28.840
Where are you?

1:02:29.912 --> 1:02:32.506
I'm sorry I've not been
to see you for a while.

1:02:32.715 --> 1:02:36.014
I haven't been able to get away
until now.

1:02:54.904 --> 1:02:56.963
Crusoe!

1:02:57.306 --> 1:02:59.297
Crusoe!

1:03:01.878 --> 1:03:04.278
Crusoe!

1:03:05.715 --> 1:03:08.047
Crusoe!

1:03:09.886 --> 1:03:11.877
Where are you?

1:03:27.136 --> 1:03:29.127
Crusoe?

1:03:34.777 --> 1:03:37.075
Holy mackerel.

1:03:45.188 --> 1:03:46.985
Hello, boy.

1:03:50.693 --> 1:03:52.320
Careful, don't tip me over.

1:03:54.363 --> 1:03:56.661
It's good to see you, boy.

1:04:02.405 --> 1:04:04.566
Wait! Don't go!

1:04:06.542 --> 1:04:07.531
Crusoe!

1:04:16.219 --> 1:04:17.686
Crusoe!

1:05:28.758 --> 1:05:31.727
This isn't so bad. It's fun, actually.

1:05:38.367 --> 1:05:40.232
Crusoe!

1:06:12.768 --> 1:06:14.235
Crusoe!

1:07:37.420 --> 1:07:39.820
Crusoe!

1:08:18.694 --> 1:08:20.423
What is it, Churchill?

1:08:21.030 --> 1:08:22.361
Slow down, boy. Heel!

1:08:44.320 --> 1:08:48.279
Shoo, shoo. Go away. Crusoe, go.

1:08:54.396 --> 1:08:57.229
Crusoe, go! Shoo!

1:09:04.507 --> 1:09:07.601
I thought it was raining, but
when I looked up, there he was.

1:09:07.810 --> 1:09:09.004
-No.
-Big as a house.

1:09:09.211 --> 1:09:12.874
-So then what happened?
-I held out my hand, "Now, Crusoe...

1:09:13.082 --> 1:09:16.518
...you have to promise
to greet me, not eat me."

1:09:16.719 --> 1:09:19.153
-Did he greet you or eat you?
-He ate me.

1:09:19.355 --> 1:09:21.016
Yeah, right.
That's why you're here.

1:09:21.223 --> 1:09:23.248
Like a sardine.

1:09:28.497 --> 1:09:30.988
-There was everything down there.
-Come on.

1:09:31.200 --> 1:09:32.428
There was even a shipwreck.

1:09:32.635 --> 1:09:34.535
-No.
-Yes.

1:09:35.704 --> 1:09:37.194
Yeah?

1:09:40.543 --> 1:09:42.875
And I could just see a treasure chest.

1:09:43.078 --> 1:09:45.171
And there was money in it.

1:09:45.381 --> 1:09:48.509
-It was too far away for me to reach.
-Yeah.

1:09:49.518 --> 1:09:51.850
It was amazing.

1:09:55.257 --> 1:09:56.747
Ma'am.

1:09:57.059 --> 1:09:58.321
Did y-- Ma'am?

1:10:00.963 --> 1:10:05.024
-Did you need something, ma'am?
-No. No. Thank you.

1:10:05.768 --> 1:10:07.030
For what?

1:10:08.170 --> 1:10:09.797
For making them laugh.

1:10:11.106 --> 1:10:14.974
Haven't heard them laugh like that
in a long time, especially Angus.

1:10:15.177 --> 1:10:18.010
-He's a good lad, ma'am.
-Yes, he is.

1:10:19.682 --> 1:10:22.150
I used to make him laugh like that.

1:10:24.386 --> 1:10:26.980
Maybe you should try again.

1:10:28.991 --> 1:10:30.117
What?

1:10:32.895 --> 1:10:37.525
Well, just give him
a wee bit more of your time.

1:10:41.003 --> 1:10:42.766
Yes.

1:10:43.172 --> 1:10:46.073
-Mr. Mowbray.
-Please, call me Lewis.

1:10:46.575 --> 1:10:48.406
Where'd you get your scar?

1:10:50.212 --> 1:10:52.077
Shrapnel.

1:10:54.617 --> 1:10:56.710
Almost took my arm off.

1:10:58.821 --> 1:11:02.416
I was a gunner on a torpedo boat.

1:11:03.926 --> 1:11:08.556
We were dive-bombed by
a German plane, and I was firing at it.

1:11:09.131 --> 1:11:11.622
Next thing, woke up in the hospital.

1:11:12.835 --> 1:11:16.202
-Is it still painful?
-It's nothing.

1:11:16.405 --> 1:11:20.000
I'm lucky, compared to
what some people have to....

1:11:27.149 --> 1:11:29.049
It's a good thing I didn't lose the arm.

1:11:31.186 --> 1:11:35.282
I'd not be much of a handyman
with one hand.

1:11:35.557 --> 1:11:39.516
You know, I'd be a one-handyman.
Sorry.

1:11:41.930 --> 1:11:45.366
No. I'm-- I'm sorry. Well--

1:11:45.567 --> 1:11:47.865
You will tell me if it's troubling you,
won't you?

1:11:54.009 --> 1:11:56.273
-Lieutenant?
-Yes, sir?

1:11:56.478 --> 1:11:58.969
We had any news
on this Mowbray character yet?

1:11:59.181 --> 1:12:02.708
Yes, sir. I put my report
on your desk yesterday, sir.

1:12:02.918 --> 1:12:05.250
Mowbray's as clean as a whistle, sir.

1:12:05.454 --> 1:12:07.979
County records show him
born and raised in Dornoch.

1:12:08.190 --> 1:12:10.886
Enlisted in the Royal Navy, 1,939.

1:12:11.093 --> 1:12:12.856
Unblemished war record.

1:12:13.062 --> 1:12:17.226
Injured in action, August 1,940,
and honorably discharged.

1:12:17.433 --> 1:12:20.596
He's something of a hero,
you might say, sir.

1:12:22.004 --> 1:12:24.905
-Thank you, Wormsley, that'll be all.
-Yes, sir.

1:12:33.615 --> 1:12:35.276
The head on it!

1:12:35.484 --> 1:12:39.011
And a tail like a crocodile,
only bigger. Wasn't it?

1:12:39.221 --> 1:12:42.520
You've been telling that story for
a week, and it changes every time.

1:12:42.725 --> 1:12:45.159
-Scales or skin?
-Skin.

1:12:45.361 --> 1:12:46.794
What's your interest, Jock?

1:12:46.995 --> 1:12:48.223
-Interest?
-Aye.

1:12:48.430 --> 1:12:50.295
This is front-page news.

1:12:50.499 --> 1:12:53.832
The Aberdeen Argus readers
will want to hear of this.

1:12:54.036 --> 1:12:55.799
Not a word of this is to get out.

1:12:56.004 --> 1:13:01.067
But Hughie, when the war's over,
there could be tourists, excursions.

1:13:01.276 --> 1:13:04.006
This could put our Loch Ness
on the map.

1:13:04.213 --> 1:13:07.410
I don't want it on the map.
Just leave things the way they are.

1:13:07.616 --> 1:13:11.518
If there's a monster in Loch Ness,
the world has a right to know.

1:13:11.720 --> 1:13:13.347
Aye.

1:13:20.696 --> 1:13:22.687
Well, it's a perfect day for it.

1:13:22.898 --> 1:13:25.492
This is awfully nice of you,
but you don't have to.

1:13:25.701 --> 1:13:29.501
No, I want you and the children to see
the important work that we're doing.

1:13:35.911 --> 1:13:40.314
If it's a mammal, it can't stay
underwater for six hours.

1:13:40.516 --> 1:13:44.475
Mammal, my arse. It's a monster,
it can do what it wants.

1:13:44.686 --> 1:13:47.655
You just be ready.
This photograph will make us all rich.

1:13:47.856 --> 1:13:49.323
Aye, aye.

1:13:51.293 --> 1:13:54.228
Well, the first thing we did
was to cut an access road...

1:13:54.430 --> 1:13:56.330
...all the way to the top of the hill.

1:13:56.532 --> 1:13:59.660
All the way up to the location. See?

1:13:59.868 --> 1:14:00.892
Sir!

1:14:01.103 --> 1:14:04.698
I know we've been an inconvenience
for you since we've been here.

1:14:04.907 --> 1:14:08.536
But I think you'll be impressed
by what I'm about to show you.

1:14:21.790 --> 1:14:25.988
This location, obviously,
has been strategically chosen...

1:14:26.195 --> 1:14:27.958
...for the long-range views.

1:14:28.163 --> 1:14:32.691
Moray Firth in the east,
Loch Lochy in the west.

1:14:32.901 --> 1:14:35.096
-Now follow me.
-Thank you.

1:14:35.804 --> 1:14:37.931
Now, here she is...

1:14:38.140 --> 1:14:40.734
...our pride and joy.

1:14:43.312 --> 1:14:45.177
Now, before we fire up Victoria--

1:14:45.380 --> 1:14:46.904
That's what we call her.

1:14:47.115 --> 1:14:50.846
--I need you three
to remain here on the perimeter.

1:14:51.053 --> 1:14:55.080
And you might wanna cover your
ears. She packs a hell of a punch.

1:14:55.290 --> 1:14:59.784
-Come on. Block your ears.
-We will be firing down the loch.

1:15:02.598 --> 1:15:04.793
Let's see what sort of splash
she makes.

1:15:10.606 --> 1:15:11.971
All right, men. Walker.

1:15:12.241 --> 1:15:14.675
-The loch? No, he can't do that.
-What on earth?

1:15:14.877 --> 1:15:17.107
I should have told you,
there's a creature there.

1:15:17.312 --> 1:15:18.904
A water horse. He could get hurt.

1:15:21.783 --> 1:15:24.308
What? Stop this nonsense
and let them do their work.

1:15:24.520 --> 1:15:26.818
-No, Captain Hamilton. You mustn't!
-Angus! Angus!

1:15:27.022 --> 1:15:28.319
We're to remain over here.

1:15:28.524 --> 1:15:32.016
Mother, please listen. He hatched
from an egg. I saved his life.

1:15:32.227 --> 1:15:33.956
-That is enough.
-Mother, it's true.

1:15:34.162 --> 1:15:36.187
He's telling the truth.
You have to believe--

1:15:36.398 --> 1:15:38.195
-No! Stop!
-Fire!

1:15:39.468 --> 1:15:40.958
Fire!

1:16:01.924 --> 1:16:03.653
Very good.

1:16:04.326 --> 1:16:05.953
What happened?

1:16:06.161 --> 1:16:09.187
Did they kill Crusoe?
That can't be the end.

1:16:09.398 --> 1:16:11.161
No, no, no.

1:16:11.366 --> 1:16:14.062
But it was the beginning of the end.

1:16:14.269 --> 1:16:17.705
Poor Angus was beside himself
for his creature.

1:16:17.906 --> 1:16:20.966
He got into terrible trouble.

1:16:27.149 --> 1:16:29.515
-No! Don't!
-Hey! You!

1:16:29.718 --> 1:16:31.310
-No! Don't!
-Control yourself, boy.

1:16:31.753 --> 1:16:34.551
Did I or did I not tell you
to wait over there?!

1:16:35.691 --> 1:16:40.060
Angus, this is not the place for us.
Can someone drive us home, please?

1:16:41.897 --> 1:16:44.229
-Certainly. Corbin.
-Yes, sir.

1:16:44.433 --> 1:16:46.765
-Kirstie.
-Anne.

1:16:50.072 --> 1:16:52.506
The boy needs discipline, Anne.

1:16:54.776 --> 1:16:59.338
The captain lost all respect
in Anne's eyes that day.

1:16:59.548 --> 1:17:01.277
All right, Corbin.

1:17:07.422 --> 1:17:11.290
That creature'll never surface
after that bombardment. Puddocks.

1:17:11.493 --> 1:17:14.758
-You bloody pests!
-Aye.

1:17:14.963 --> 1:17:20.060
And he blew a big hole in Jock's plans
for fame and Jimmy's for fortune.

1:17:20.268 --> 1:17:22.099
-To the left!
-Jimmy McGarry was a man...

1:17:22.304 --> 1:17:25.432
...not to be lightly parted
from a pound or a penny.

1:17:25.641 --> 1:17:28.371
-To the right!
-He had seen the monster...

1:17:28.577 --> 1:17:31.705
...and he was determined
the rest of the world should see it too.

1:17:31.913 --> 1:17:34.074
-Get out of the picture.
-Aye, go!

1:17:34.282 --> 1:17:35.442
Off you go.

1:17:39.921 --> 1:17:41.354
Aye.

1:17:41.556 --> 1:17:45.788
-We have got it.
-We're going to be rich. Rich.

1:17:45.994 --> 1:17:49.555
You can come in now,
you daft buggers.

1:17:50.098 --> 1:17:52.828
Everyone had a tale to tell
about the monster.

1:17:53.502 --> 1:17:58.235
Everyone except poor Angus.

1:17:58.440 --> 1:18:01.637
He was sent to bed at 6
every night for a month.

1:18:01.843 --> 1:18:03.470
Even his goody-two-shoes sister...

1:18:03.679 --> 1:18:06.739
...could not convince their mother
of the truth.

1:18:06.948 --> 1:18:10.406
And no one
had laid sight of Crusoe...

1:18:10.619 --> 1:18:12.883
...since the bombardment...

1:18:13.088 --> 1:18:17.457
...until that fateful night.

1:18:20.062 --> 1:18:21.654
Blimey, that's it.

1:18:21.863 --> 1:18:24.457
-What's it?
-The monster.

1:18:24.666 --> 1:18:26.531
That's just what I saw.

1:18:29.971 --> 1:18:32.963
If it's out there, I'll catch it.

1:18:34.543 --> 1:18:36.977
Let's go hunting, boys.

1:18:42.551 --> 1:18:44.746
-Angus.
-Kirstie?

1:18:44.953 --> 1:18:46.352
This is Lewis' idea.

1:18:46.555 --> 1:18:50.548
If you tell Mummy I let you out,
I'll deny it. Do you understand?

1:18:56.565 --> 1:18:58.965
Now everyone's talking
about seeing the beast.

1:18:59.167 --> 1:19:02.136
You have to get him
to hide better or something.

1:19:08.477 --> 1:19:10.069
Crusoe!

1:19:10.278 --> 1:19:13.839
Crusoe! Come!

1:19:21.256 --> 1:19:23.087
Try again.

1:19:23.291 --> 1:19:26.920
Crusoe! Come!

1:19:49.618 --> 1:19:52.178
Crusoe! Easy, boy, it's me!

1:19:54.723 --> 1:19:57.317
-Lewis, what's happened to him?
-He's gone wild, lad.

1:19:57.526 --> 1:19:59.551
No. You're wrong.

1:20:00.862 --> 1:20:02.261
You'll see.

1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:06.092
Angus, be careful.

1:20:16.344 --> 1:20:18.642
Easy, boy.

1:20:18.847 --> 1:20:21.077
I'm your friend.

1:20:27.255 --> 1:20:28.415
No, Angus!

1:20:48.276 --> 1:20:52.303
It was your idea to put him in the wild.
You said it would be best for him.

1:20:52.514 --> 1:20:54.914
I didn't know that
they'd shoot at him.

1:20:55.116 --> 1:20:57.311
This is your fault.

1:21:22.711 --> 1:21:24.679
Will it work?

1:21:25.113 --> 1:21:28.446
Soft spot. Back of the neck.

1:21:28.650 --> 1:21:30.914
Consider it dead.

1:21:44.599 --> 1:21:46.965
Did you shoot that plane down?

1:21:47.168 --> 1:21:48.465
What?

1:21:48.670 --> 1:21:51.935
The plane you were shooting at
when you got hurt.

1:21:52.140 --> 1:21:54.938
Well, it's not something I brag about.

1:21:56.177 --> 1:21:57.769
Why not?

1:22:07.088 --> 1:22:09.352
-Crusoe.
-Angus.

1:22:14.029 --> 1:22:15.758
You hear that?

1:22:16.264 --> 1:22:18.027
It's Churchill.

1:22:18.466 --> 1:22:21.867
I think he's onto something.
Good dog!

1:22:22.070 --> 1:22:26.404
It's that dog. He'll tell everyone
where Crusoe is.

1:22:33.281 --> 1:22:37.775
-Wormsley, over there. In that cove.
-I'll take her in.

1:23:08.116 --> 1:23:09.276
Kill the engine.

1:23:11.553 --> 1:23:13.214
Where's he gone?

1:23:14.089 --> 1:23:15.989
Churchill?

1:23:16.257 --> 1:23:18.191
Oi, Churchill!

1:23:21.196 --> 1:23:23.756
Maybe he's just
chasing a rabbit or something.

1:23:24.632 --> 1:23:25.929
That's not it.

1:23:38.913 --> 1:23:41.347
Someone kill it! Kill it!

1:23:46.554 --> 1:23:51.082
Mayday! Mayday! We're on the loch.
And we're under attack!

1:23:56.364 --> 1:23:59.765
-Where is he?
-There it is, port side.

1:24:03.571 --> 1:24:06.335
Shoot it! Shoot it!

1:24:08.143 --> 1:24:10.407
Turn the boat around.

1:24:11.179 --> 1:24:13.170
Where is it? Where is it?

1:24:48.817 --> 1:24:50.512
Anne.

1:24:51.586 --> 1:24:52.780
Look, I....

1:24:53.721 --> 1:24:57.179
I don't wish to carry on like this.
I apologize for my actions on the hill.

1:24:57.392 --> 1:24:59.917
No, no. We should apologize.

1:25:00.128 --> 1:25:03.757
Angus should never have behaved
in such an inappropriate fashion.

1:25:03.965 --> 1:25:05.694
-Sir!
-I do--

1:25:06.201 --> 1:25:09.261
Sir! We just had a call from the loch.
We're under attack.

1:25:10.939 --> 1:25:12.770
-What?
-We're under attack, sir.

1:25:12.974 --> 1:25:14.874
-Get me a sub. This could be it!
-Right.

1:25:15.076 --> 1:25:17.135
-Bring my jeep around to the front.
-Yes, sir.

1:25:17.345 --> 1:25:19.506
You take the children into the cellar.
Wormsley?

1:25:19.714 --> 1:25:22.012
Kirstie, Angus, downstairs now!

1:25:23.218 --> 1:25:25.345
-Angus is-- He's not here.
-What?

1:25:25.553 --> 1:25:28.545
-He's gone down to the loch.
-Oh, my God.

1:25:28.756 --> 1:25:31.190
Come quickly. Hurry, downstairs.
Go, go, go.

1:25:31.392 --> 1:25:32.859
-This is not a drill.
-Yes, sir.

1:25:33.061 --> 1:25:36.553
Clyde, bring the car round to the front
of the house straightaway.

1:25:36.764 --> 1:25:40.666
-I can't let you. It's too dangerous.
-He's my son. You try to stop me.

1:25:49.444 --> 1:25:51.344
Go away from me!

1:25:52.213 --> 1:25:54.773
Go away. Go away from me!

1:25:58.086 --> 1:26:01.146
Oh, my God. Please.

1:26:03.258 --> 1:26:05.488
No. No, please!

1:26:07.962 --> 1:26:12.092
-Crusoe!
-Go the other way. Turn around.

1:26:12.300 --> 1:26:13.995
Please! Go.

1:26:21.776 --> 1:26:24.711
Crusoe! Stop! Put him down!

1:26:25.113 --> 1:26:27.741
-Oh, go away!
-Stop it!

1:26:30.852 --> 1:26:33.753
-Crusoe! Stop!
-Angus, no!

1:26:41.396 --> 1:26:42.693
Crusoe!

1:26:45.433 --> 1:26:46.832
No!

1:26:52.106 --> 1:26:55.473
-Somebody! Get off me! Help.
-Crusoe?

1:27:37.619 --> 1:27:41.316
Angus? Can you hear me?

1:27:41.556 --> 1:27:45.788
Come on, lad. Come on, son.
Come on, Angus, breathe.

1:27:46.327 --> 1:27:47.794
Come on!

1:27:48.429 --> 1:27:53.059
If you have any magic in you at all,
use it on this lad, I'm begging you.

1:27:58.273 --> 1:28:00.173
Put the gunners on high alert,
understand?

1:28:00.375 --> 1:28:02.935
Any sign of an enemy vessel,
you fire at will.

1:28:03.144 --> 1:28:06.341
-But, sir--
-No. You fire at will!

1:28:10.752 --> 1:28:14.153
Come on. Come on, lad.

1:28:14.355 --> 1:28:15.788
Come on. Breathe, Angus.

1:28:15.990 --> 1:28:18.515
Come on, get some good Scottish air
in those lungs.

1:28:19.594 --> 1:28:21.653
Stay with me, Angus.
Stay with me, lad.

1:28:21.863 --> 1:28:26.095
Come on. Come on, lad, breathe.
Come on.

1:28:35.243 --> 1:28:38.303
Come on, lad.
Come on, we should go now.

1:28:40.848 --> 1:28:45.080
Know something? This old workshop
is the place I'll miss the most.

1:28:47.121 --> 1:28:48.554
You'll look after it for me?

1:28:54.662 --> 1:28:57.631
And I'll bet you grow into these
by the time I get back.

1:29:02.770 --> 1:29:04.761
You keep them well-polished.

1:29:13.815 --> 1:29:15.976
We'll have none of that.

1:29:16.317 --> 1:29:20.583
You're the man of the house now.
I need you to be strong and sure.

1:29:21.122 --> 1:29:24.523
All right, Dad. Strong and sure.

1:29:25.026 --> 1:29:27.290
Aye. That's my boy.

1:29:33.067 --> 1:29:36.628
That's it. That's it.
Good lad. That's it.

1:29:37.338 --> 1:29:39.067
Good boy.

1:29:42.076 --> 1:29:43.737
Crusoe?

1:29:51.719 --> 1:29:54.187
That's a good water horse.

1:30:01.162 --> 1:30:03.289
-Thanks. Oh, God.
-Captain Hamilton!

1:30:03.931 --> 1:30:04.898
Angus!

1:30:05.099 --> 1:30:07.124
-He's all right.
-Angus, what happened?

1:30:07.335 --> 1:30:09.132
-You got to kill it.
-What's happening?

1:30:09.337 --> 1:30:12.272
-I was only trying to save Crusoe.
-Who's Crusoe?

1:30:12.507 --> 1:30:15.169
-Wouldn't believe me if I told you.
-It's a sea monster.

1:30:15.376 --> 1:30:16.343
It was just there--

1:30:16.544 --> 1:30:19.707
-What are you talking about?
-I swear it. He was just there.

1:30:21.516 --> 1:30:25.816
A sea monster? Are you telling me
this has all been about a sea monster?

1:30:27.655 --> 1:30:28.952
What is going on here?

1:30:29.891 --> 1:30:33.349
Has everyone gone mad?!
A sea monster?

1:30:35.430 --> 1:30:37.193
There is no monster.

1:30:37.398 --> 1:30:39.628
There's just you
with your bloody gun!

1:30:40.902 --> 1:30:42.426
And you.

1:30:42.637 --> 1:30:47.097
Filling his head with tales
of sea creatures and magic?

1:30:47.675 --> 1:30:51.577
There's no monster.
And there's no magic.

1:30:52.046 --> 1:30:54.844
-Mother....
-There's just--

1:30:56.818 --> 1:31:01.255
There's just this war, and death...

1:31:01.923 --> 1:31:04.391
...and people acting insane.

1:31:05.793 --> 1:31:08.193
What's wrong with everyone?

1:31:35.790 --> 1:31:37.052
Angus?

1:31:37.258 --> 1:31:40.591
-Yes, Mum. I tried to tell you.
-Yes, you did.

1:31:40.795 --> 1:31:44.458
His name's Crusoe. I raised him,
right out of an egg.

1:31:44.665 --> 1:31:45.996
Angus, be careful!

1:31:46.200 --> 1:31:49.829
It's all right. He's my friend.
He's peaceful, really.

1:31:50.037 --> 1:31:53.734
He's not peaceful at all, sir.
The damn thing tried to eat me.

1:32:04.151 --> 1:32:06.085
Crusoe! Get out of here!

1:32:07.488 --> 1:32:08.785
Crusoe, come!

1:32:10.391 --> 1:32:11.380
Crusoe!

1:32:12.894 --> 1:32:16.887
-Oh, my God.
-Crusoe, come!

1:32:17.298 --> 1:32:18.697
Good boy.

1:32:18.900 --> 1:32:21.562
-Come on. Over here.
-No!

1:32:23.271 --> 1:32:24.260
Angus!

1:32:25.606 --> 1:32:28.166
Angus! Angus!

1:32:42.823 --> 1:32:46.020
Faster, Crusoe!
We have to get to the net!

1:32:48.629 --> 1:32:50.790
The sea. He's trying to
get Crusoe out to sea.

1:32:50.998 --> 1:32:53.125
Victoria base, come in.

1:32:53.935 --> 1:32:56.802
Victoria base, come in.

1:32:57.171 --> 1:32:59.503
You have to do something.
You have to stop them.

1:32:59.707 --> 1:33:02.870
All the radios are down.
We have to get to the net.

1:33:08.916 --> 1:33:11.783
All ammunition up here.
On the double!

1:33:13.921 --> 1:33:15.821
Help!

1:33:17.692 --> 1:33:19.523
No! No.

1:33:26.033 --> 1:33:28.058
You were in the Royal Navy.
That's right?

1:33:28.269 --> 1:33:30.703
-Aye, sir.
-Think you can handle this tub?

1:33:43.951 --> 1:33:48.581
I see the channel. Now head to sea,
boy, as fast as you can.

1:34:06.207 --> 1:34:08.937
-Come on, keep it moving.
-I see something.

1:34:09.610 --> 1:34:14.411
The rain's too heavy to make it out
clearly. It looks like a periscope.

1:34:15.416 --> 1:34:20.285
Good God, it is. A German sub.
Prepare to fire.

1:34:27.695 --> 1:34:29.458
Fire!

1:34:33.034 --> 1:34:36.800
Go under, Crusoe.
We have to go under!

1:34:59.326 --> 1:35:00.350
-There!
-Where?

1:35:00.561 --> 1:35:03.553
-Over there! Can you see them?
-I can't see him.

1:35:09.970 --> 1:35:11.267
-Rapp! Situation report?
-Sir.

1:35:11.472 --> 1:35:14.464
One of our own torpedo boats
is in pursuit of the target.

1:35:14.675 --> 1:35:18.702
They're on the run. Don't let them
get to the sea. Raise the nets!

1:35:35.029 --> 1:35:37.497
Faster, Crusoe!

1:35:42.136 --> 1:35:44.297
Go, Crusoe! Go!

1:36:23.110 --> 1:36:24.873
What are we going to do?

1:36:26.113 --> 1:36:28.741
-Angus!
-Over here!

1:36:28.949 --> 1:36:30.314
Angus!

1:36:30.518 --> 1:36:34.249
-Let him go!
-Do as he says!

1:36:34.455 --> 1:36:36.389
Go on, boy!

1:36:37.691 --> 1:36:40.159
Angus, let him go!

1:36:40.761 --> 1:36:42.820
Let go, Angus!

1:36:43.397 --> 1:36:45.388
Let go!

1:36:48.068 --> 1:36:50.969
You're the best friend I've ever had.

1:37:03.350 --> 1:37:05.875
I'll never forget you.

1:37:29.910 --> 1:37:35.177
No, Crusoe! You can't stay here!
Go and hide in the loch.

1:37:36.350 --> 1:37:38.341
Crusoe, go!

1:37:40.020 --> 1:37:43.353
Don't you hear me, you bloody fool?
Do as I say.

1:37:43.624 --> 1:37:44.613
Go!

1:37:55.569 --> 1:37:57.434
Come on!

1:37:59.340 --> 1:38:01.433
-Come on, Angus.
-You're nearly there.

1:38:02.276 --> 1:38:03.641
-Come on.
-Come on, lad.

1:38:05.546 --> 1:38:08.174
Now give me your hand.
Give me your hand, boy. Come on.

1:38:08.382 --> 1:38:10.350
Get him in the boat.

1:38:11.118 --> 1:38:13.382
That's it. Good lad.

1:38:15.256 --> 1:38:18.089
Where is he? Where'd he go?

1:38:25.633 --> 1:38:26.691
There he is!

1:38:42.182 --> 1:38:44.309
-He's gonna jump the net!
-It's too high!

1:38:44.518 --> 1:38:46.418
He'll never make it.

1:39:22.456 --> 1:39:26.756
You did it, Crusoe! Well done, boy!

1:40:09.336 --> 1:40:12.635
He'll not be coming back, will he?

1:40:14.508 --> 1:40:17.602
I think he's meant to be
on his own, dear.

1:40:18.579 --> 1:40:21.776
Not Crusoe. I meant...

1:40:22.783 --> 1:40:24.478
...Daddy.

1:40:30.324 --> 1:40:33.316
No, love. He'll not.

1:40:42.102 --> 1:40:44.662
-Look! Look, Angus! Up here.
-Up here!

1:40:44.872 --> 1:40:46.533
-You have to come quickly.
-Look!

1:40:46.740 --> 1:40:48.002
Come on, quickly.

1:41:33.854 --> 1:41:36.789
Some say the creature
comes back from time to time...

1:41:36.990 --> 1:41:39.083
...looking for his friend.

1:41:39.359 --> 1:41:42.658
Some claim to have seen it
over the years.

1:41:42.863 --> 1:41:47.596
But the boy never saw it again.

1:41:50.104 --> 1:41:52.038
That's a wonderful story.

1:41:52.239 --> 1:41:56.232
Aye. And all true, every word of it.

1:41:56.743 --> 1:41:58.404
Thank you....

1:41:59.146 --> 1:42:01.046
Angus.

1:42:01.415 --> 1:42:03.906
Angus MacMorrow is the name.

1:42:05.552 --> 1:42:07.816
He was so sweet. I know it's true.

1:42:08.021 --> 1:42:10.751
-It's a great story, but it's not true.
-You are so cynical.

1:42:10.958 --> 1:42:12.516
William?

1:42:13.460 --> 1:42:15.325
William!

1:42:21.535 --> 1:42:23.230
William!

1:42:25.372 --> 1:42:26.634
William...

1:42:26.840 --> 1:42:29.104
...where are you?
