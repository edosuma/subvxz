WEBVTT

00:01.755 --> 00:03.974
Oh, my God.
I love this chicken.

00:03.976 --> 00:05.559
Oh, you know
what they say,

00:05.561 --> 00:09.062
best things in life
are free.

00:09.064 --> 00:11.031
Okay, you're right.
I eat your food a lot.

00:11.033 --> 00:11.982
Now, how about this?

00:11.984 --> 00:13.783
You can raid my fridge
anytime you want.

00:13.785 --> 00:15.568
Oh, that's
very kind of you.

00:15.571 --> 00:18.738
Next time I have a hankering to
wash down a D-cell battery

00:18.740 --> 00:20.407
with a jar of
old pickle juice,

00:20.409 --> 00:22.826
I'll come a-knockin'.

00:22.828 --> 00:24.995
Hey, Raj, you didn't
send your RSVP in.

00:24.997 --> 00:27.914
I'm suppose to ask you if you're
bringing someone to the wedding.

00:27.916 --> 00:29.716
I'll let you know.

00:29.718 --> 00:31.051
Well, can you make it soon?

00:31.053 --> 00:33.086
There's a battle royale going on
over the seating charts.

00:33.088 --> 00:36.789
In one corner, Bernadette's mom,
in the other three, mine.

00:36.791 --> 00:39.643
Yeah, I hate
wedding receptions.

00:39.645 --> 00:41.061
Yeah, I wish the bride and groom

00:41.063 --> 00:42.479
would take a cue
from Bilbo Baggins.

00:42.481 --> 00:45.649
Slip on the ring, disappear,
and everyone goes home.

00:45.651 --> 00:48.485
Mm, you liked
Professor Geyser's wedding.

00:48.487 --> 00:51.054
They had a
make-your-own-sundae bar.

00:51.056 --> 00:53.440
Oh, that was
a night to remember.

00:53.442 --> 00:57.944
Do you know, on one trip,
I just had a bowl of nuts.

00:57.946 --> 01:00.697
Anyway, you got to let me know
if you have a plus one.

01:00.699 --> 01:02.999
Because if not, my mom's trying
to sneak in the doctor

01:03.001 --> 01:05.452
who sucked the fat
out of her neck.

01:09.006 --> 01:10.507
All right, uh, fine.

01:10.509 --> 01:12.509
I'm coming and
I'm bringing somebody.

01:12.511 --> 01:13.960
Uh, Koothrappali plus one.

01:13.962 --> 01:14.827
Who you bringing?

01:14.829 --> 01:15.929
Who are you bringing?!

01:17.014 --> 01:19.216
He's bringing me;
who are you bringing?

01:19.218 --> 01:23.002
Wow, what a bunch of
Nosey O'Donnells.

01:23.004 --> 01:24.537
Come on, who is it?

01:24.539 --> 01:26.389
I'm not telling.

01:26.391 --> 01:29.442
I'm from Asia,
I'm mysterious, deal with it.

01:30.511 --> 01:33.196
Howard aren't having
a make-your-own-sundae bar?

01:33.198 --> 01:35.031
I don't think so.

01:35.033 --> 01:36.066
Well, you should.

01:36.068 --> 01:38.118
50% of marriages end in divorce,

01:38.120 --> 01:41.938
but 100% of make-your-own-sundae
bars end in happiness.

02:08.768 --> 02:10.901
Hello, Mummy, Daddy.
How are you?

02:10.904 --> 02:12.987
Pretty good.
Can't complain.

02:12.989 --> 02:14.556
Oh, I'm sure you can.

02:14.558 --> 02:17.225
Just give it a minute.

02:17.227 --> 02:18.643
Listen, uh,

02:18.645 --> 02:20.862
there's something
I want to talk to you about.

02:20.864 --> 02:23.415
I wasn't ready until now, but...

02:23.417 --> 02:24.982
I think it's time.

02:24.984 --> 02:26.534
It's finally happening.

02:26.536 --> 02:29.137
You're coming out of
the closet, aren't you?

02:30.189 --> 02:33.041
We love you, and we accept
your alternate lifestyle.

02:33.043 --> 02:36.361
Just... keep it to yourself.

02:36.363 --> 02:39.080
No, I'm not gay.

02:39.799 --> 02:42.183
If anything, I'm metrosexual.

02:42.185 --> 02:43.318
What's that?

02:43.320 --> 02:45.019
It means I like women

02:45.021 --> 02:47.272
as well as
their skin-care products.

02:47.274 --> 02:48.990
Well, if you're
not coming out,

02:48.992 --> 02:51.926
why did you call us during
the cricket semifinals?

02:51.928 --> 02:55.063
I'm tired of trying
to meet someone,

02:55.065 --> 02:58.783
and I think I'd like you
to help me find a...

02:58.785 --> 03:00.652
a wife.

03:00.654 --> 03:02.670
And just to clarify...

03:02.672 --> 03:04.439
a female wife?

03:04.441 --> 03:06.791
Yes!

03:06.793 --> 03:09.794
Matchmaking--
very smart move, son.

03:09.796 --> 03:11.946
Much better than
marrying for love.

03:16.752 --> 03:19.354
We married for love.

03:19.356 --> 03:23.024
And it's been
wonderful!

03:25.311 --> 03:29.547
Quantum physics
makes me so happy.

03:29.549 --> 03:30.899
Yeah, I'm glad.

03:30.901 --> 03:33.585
It's like looking
at the universe naked.

03:41.361 --> 03:43.244
Hi. Guys got a minute?

03:43.246 --> 03:44.496
Sure. What's up?

03:44.498 --> 03:47.064
Well, I was thinking about
Sheldon's little joke

03:47.066 --> 03:49.200
the other night about me
eating all your food.

03:49.202 --> 03:51.369
Oh! That was no joke.
But...

03:52.254 --> 03:53.371
I understand your confusion,

03:53.373 --> 03:55.457
as I am our group's
resident cutup.

03:57.092 --> 03:58.193
I'm sorry,

03:58.195 --> 04:00.094
you are our resident cutup?

04:00.096 --> 04:02.430
Yes.

04:02.432 --> 04:04.415
Oh, prove it.

04:04.417 --> 04:05.467
Knock-knock.

04:05.469 --> 04:07.135
- Who's there?
- Interrupting physicist.

04:07.137 --> 04:10.054
Interrupting phys...
Muon!

04:12.808 --> 04:15.426
Anyway, I got a little residual
check from my commercial,

04:15.428 --> 04:17.579
and I thought, hey,
how about I get the guys

04:17.581 --> 04:19.930
a little thank you
to pay them back?

04:19.933 --> 04:20.765
So, Sheldon...

04:20.767 --> 04:22.567
ta-da!

04:22.569 --> 04:25.269
A vintage mint-in-box

04:25.271 --> 04:28.272
1975 Mego <i>Star Trek</i>
Transporter

04:28.274 --> 04:29.741
with real transporter action.

04:29.743 --> 04:31.609
Hot darn!

04:31.611 --> 04:34.245
Where did you get that?

04:34.247 --> 04:35.713
From Stuart,
at the comic book store.

04:35.715 --> 04:38.800
You went to the
comic book store by yourself?

04:38.802 --> 04:40.468
Yeah. It was fun.

04:40.470 --> 04:43.805
I walked in, and two different
guys got asthma attacks.

04:44.807 --> 04:46.791
Felt pretty good.

04:46.793 --> 04:49.310
This calls for an
expression of gratitude.

04:49.312 --> 04:52.063
Ooh, am I about to get
a rare Sheldon Cooper hug?

04:52.065 --> 04:54.399
No, not this time.
Then they wouldn't be special.

04:54.401 --> 04:55.800
Thanks, Penny.

04:57.686 --> 04:59.153
You're welcome.

04:59.155 --> 05:01.155
Don't worry,
I didn't forget about you.

05:01.157 --> 05:02.473
Oh...

05:02.475 --> 05:04.692
Leonard, I got you...

05:04.694 --> 05:06.594
a label-maker!

05:12.484 --> 05:15.653
Wow...

05:15.655 --> 05:17.038
No, it's great.

05:17.040 --> 05:19.991
- Also mint-in-box.
- Mm.

05:19.993 --> 05:22.343
And I got you
a transporter, too!

05:22.345 --> 05:23.878
Awesome!

05:27.383 --> 05:29.634
Look, it was actually
designed for

05:29.636 --> 05:31.168
my vintage Mr. Spock
action figure.

05:31.170 --> 05:33.421
Oh, that's great! Let's open
them up and put him in there.

05:33.423 --> 05:35.473
- Open it?!
- Oh, good Lord, no!

05:35.475 --> 05:37.692
Why? They're just toys.

05:37.694 --> 05:39.861
- They're collectibles.
- They're mint-in-box.

05:39.863 --> 05:41.613
Come on. Can't we open
one up and take a look?

05:41.615 --> 05:43.848
No, don't!

05:43.850 --> 05:46.985
Once you open the box,
it loses its value.

05:46.987 --> 05:50.321
Yeah, yeah. My mom gave me the
same lecture about my virginity.

05:52.124 --> 05:54.325
Gotta tell you,
it was a lot more fun

05:54.327 --> 05:56.511
taking it out
and playing with it.

05:58.914 --> 06:01.866
Are you sure you want us here
when you meet this woman?

06:01.868 --> 06:02.834
Oh, yes.

06:02.836 --> 06:04.002
In my culture, it's expected

06:04.004 --> 06:06.004
to have a chaperone
to oversee a first date.

06:06.006 --> 06:08.590
Plus, I want to make a good
impression, and no offense,

06:08.592 --> 06:12.343
but with you guys here,
I look like I'm six-two.

06:13.846 --> 06:16.848
The nuns always chaperoned
the dances at my high school.

06:16.850 --> 06:20.985
They used to make us leave room
between us for the Holy Spirit.

06:20.987 --> 06:22.520
Uh, Hindus do the same thing.

06:22.522 --> 06:25.523
Except they leave room
for a cow.

06:25.525 --> 06:29.077
Listen, I love your charming
racist humor, but any chance

06:29.079 --> 06:31.446
you could not mock
my religion while she's here?

06:31.448 --> 06:33.665
Yesterday, you made fun of me
for eating lox.

06:33.667 --> 06:35.667
It's different, your people
don't worship lox.

06:35.669 --> 06:38.720
Clearly, you've never been
to brunch with my cousins.

06:39.838 --> 06:41.623
So, arranged marriages--
the parents just decide

06:41.625 --> 06:43.424
and then you have
to get married?

06:43.426 --> 06:45.343
No, no, I get a say in it.

06:45.345 --> 06:47.545
But I'm sure whoever shows up
will be better company

06:47.547 --> 06:48.880
than the threesome
I've been having

06:48.882 --> 06:51.432
with Aunt Jemima
and Mrs. Butterworth.

06:53.352 --> 06:55.053
Excuse me, are you Rajesh?

06:55.055 --> 06:55.937
Ah, yes.

06:55.939 --> 06:56.971
You must be Lakshmi.

06:56.973 --> 06:58.255
Uh, nice to meet you.

06:58.257 --> 06:59.724
Nice to meet you, too.

07:00.610 --> 07:02.093
Oh! These are my friends.

07:02.095 --> 07:03.778
- This is Bernadette.
- Hello.

07:03.780 --> 07:05.647
- And this is Howard.
- Nice to meet you.

07:05.649 --> 07:08.199
- You, too.
- Please, have a seat.

07:08.201 --> 07:10.902
I'm thinking double wedding.

07:15.240 --> 07:18.326
<i>Dr. Cooper.</i>

07:20.129 --> 07:23.264
<i>Dr. Cooper?</i>

07:23.266 --> 07:24.499
Is someone there?

07:24.501 --> 07:27.101
<i>Down here.</i>
<i>On your desk.</i>

07:30.956 --> 07:32.790
Spock?

07:32.792 --> 07:35.660
<i>I need to speak with you.</i>

07:35.662 --> 07:38.796
Fascinating.

07:38.798 --> 07:42.150
The only logical explanation
is that this is a dream.

07:42.152 --> 07:44.986
<i>It is not the only</i>
<i>logical explanation.</i>

07:44.988 --> 07:47.555
<i>For example,</i>
<i>you could be hallucinating</i>

07:47.557 --> 07:52.060
<i>after being hit on the head</i>
<i>by, say, a coconut.</i>

07:52.062 --> 07:55.813
Was I hit on the head
by a coconut?

07:55.815 --> 07:59.784
<i>I am not going to</i>
<i>dignify that with a response.</i>

08:01.036 --> 08:02.236
<i>Now to the matter at hand.</i>

08:02.238 --> 08:04.806
<i>You need to play</i>
<i>with the transporter toy.</i>

08:04.808 --> 08:06.257
But it's mint-in-box.

08:06.259 --> 08:07.408
<i>Yes.</i>

08:07.410 --> 08:09.494
<i>And to open it</i>
<i>would destroy its value.</i>

08:09.496 --> 08:12.447
<i>But remember, like me,</i>

08:12.449 --> 08:14.515
<i>you also have a human half.</i>

08:14.517 --> 08:18.502
Well, I'm not going to
dignify that with a response.

08:18.504 --> 08:20.922
<i>Consider this.</i>

08:20.924 --> 08:22.790
<i>What is the purpose of a toy?</i>

08:22.792 --> 08:24.192
To be played with.

08:24.194 --> 08:27.195
<i>Therefore, to not</i>
<i>play with it would be...?</i>

08:27.197 --> 08:28.696
Illogical.

08:28.698 --> 08:32.349
Damn it, Spock, you're right.

08:32.351 --> 08:34.619
I'll do it.

08:34.621 --> 08:36.187
<i>Sheldon, wait.</i>

08:37.106 --> 08:38.740
<i>You have to wake up first.</i>

08:38.741 --> 08:40.857
Oh, of course.

08:40.860 --> 08:44.178
Set phasers to dumb, right?

08:45.164 --> 08:46.864
Goodie, goodie, goodie!

08:49.168 --> 08:50.668
This is wrong, this is wrong.

08:50.670 --> 08:53.221
I'm so excited,
but this is wrong.

08:56.091 --> 08:57.842
I'm going to do it.

08:57.844 --> 08:59.594
I'm doing it.

08:59.596 --> 09:01.646
I did it.

09:06.219 --> 09:09.070
That's what I always thought
1975 smelled like.

09:12.157 --> 09:15.493
One to beam down,
Mr. Scott.

09:15.495 --> 09:17.328
Aye, aye, Mr. Spock.

09:17.330 --> 09:18.863
Energize.

09:22.584 --> 09:24.352
Energize.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:34.379 --> 09:35.963
No. No.

09:35.965 --> 09:37.965
Don't be broken.

09:37.967 --> 09:40.601
Oh, please, don't be broken.

09:42.420 --> 09:45.556
What did you make me do?!

09:45.558 --> 09:48.860
Okay, okay, think.

09:55.284 --> 09:57.485
It's only logical.

09:59.955 --> 10:00.841
My goodness,

10:00.842 --> 10:02.458
that was delicious.

10:02.459 --> 10:06.261
Well, I hope you saved room
for chocolate lava cake.

10:06.263 --> 10:07.812
Impressive.

10:08.115 --> 10:10.266
What goes into
making something like that?

10:10.268 --> 10:11.984
Well, you start
out by trying to

10:11.986 --> 10:15.037
make chocolate soufflé,
and when it falls, you panic,

10:15.039 --> 10:17.940
quickly change the name,
and voila, lava cake.

10:19.192 --> 10:22.244
I bet our parents are dying to
know how things are going here.

10:22.246 --> 10:24.196
Well, let's see.

10:25.499 --> 10:27.366
Yep, three missed calls.

10:27.368 --> 10:29.168
Four missed calls,
two text messages

10:29.170 --> 10:31.236
and a failed video chat.
I win!

10:32.790 --> 10:35.508
So, what are
we going to tell them?

10:35.510 --> 10:38.344
I'd like to tell them
things are going well.

10:38.346 --> 10:39.512
Me, too.

10:39.514 --> 10:41.180
But before we get
their hopes up,

10:41.182 --> 10:43.632
we should probably make sure
we're on the same page.

10:43.634 --> 10:45.551
Okay.

10:45.553 --> 10:47.937
What page are you on?

10:47.939 --> 10:49.221
I'm on the one

10:49.223 --> 10:51.390
where I'm under
a lot of pressure

10:51.392 --> 10:53.926
from my parents to get married
and settle down

10:53.928 --> 10:55.561
and have a family,

10:55.563 --> 10:58.714
and I'm going to do it
so they don't find out I'm gay.

11:00.383 --> 11:02.785
Say again?

11:02.787 --> 11:04.119
I'm gay.

11:04.121 --> 11:06.889
Like... dude-on-dude,

11:06.891 --> 11:09.525
but with women?

11:09.527 --> 11:11.994
I know a fake marriage
isn't an honest way to live,

11:11.996 --> 11:14.446
but you of all people
should know how difficult it is

11:14.448 --> 11:15.948
to come out in our culture.

11:15.950 --> 11:18.784
Why me of all people?!

11:18.786 --> 11:21.237
Well, there's a rumor
back in New Delhi that you're--

11:21.239 --> 11:22.738
how shall we say--

11:22.740 --> 11:25.391
comfortable in a sari.

11:25.393 --> 11:27.476
I'm not gay!

11:27.478 --> 11:28.978
Really? The chocolate lava cake,

11:28.980 --> 11:31.647
the little soaps
in the bathroom, and I'm sorry,

11:31.649 --> 11:34.350
but you're wearing
more perfume than I am.

11:34.352 --> 11:38.821
That's Unbreakable
by Khloe and Lamar.

11:38.823 --> 11:41.523
And for your information,
it's unisex.

11:41.525 --> 11:43.242
Fill in the blank.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.977
I love the nightlife...

11:44.979 --> 11:46.428
I like to boogie.

11:46.430 --> 11:47.479
Got you.

11:47.481 --> 11:51.116
With women! I like
to boogie with women!

11:51.118 --> 11:53.052
That's disappointing.

11:53.054 --> 11:55.754
You were exactly the kind
of phony-baloney husband

11:55.756 --> 11:57.323
I was looking for.

11:57.325 --> 11:58.991
Thank you.

11:58.993 --> 12:02.962
And once again, my
baloney likes girls.

12:02.964 --> 12:05.330
W-W-Wait!

12:05.332 --> 12:07.549
You don't want to put a
bite of that in your mouth

12:07.551 --> 12:09.985
without trying my
homemade Chantilly cream.

12:11.170 --> 12:13.656
Yeah, okay,
that time I heard it.

12:25.902 --> 12:29.288
Oh, dear.

12:29.290 --> 12:32.791
Two suns and no sunscreen.

12:37.297 --> 12:38.864
<i>Hello again, Sheldon.</i>

12:40.734 --> 12:43.736
What is it now, Tiny Spock?

12:43.738 --> 12:45.804
I am very disappointed in you.

12:45.806 --> 12:48.407
You broke your toy
<i>and switched it with Leonard's.</i>

12:48.409 --> 12:50.776
<i>You should be</i>
<i>ashamed of yourself.</i>

12:50.778 --> 12:53.512
You're the one who told
me to play with it.

12:53.514 --> 12:55.814
<i>If I told you to jump off</i>
<i>the bridge of the</i> Enterprise,

12:55.816 --> 12:57.282
<i>would you do it?</i>

12:57.284 --> 13:00.185
Oh, if I got on the bridge
of the <i>Enterprise,</i>

13:00.187 --> 13:02.771
I would never, ever leave.

13:02.773 --> 13:06.925
<i>Trust me, it gets old</i>
<i>after a while.</i>

13:08.428 --> 13:10.429
<i>You must right</i>
<i>your wrongs, Sheldon.</i>

13:10.431 --> 13:12.397
Why? I got away with it.

13:12.399 --> 13:15.918
Leonard has his toy,
and he's never going to open it,

13:15.920 --> 13:17.703
so he won't know it's broken.

13:17.705 --> 13:20.039
And I have a toy
that isn't broken.

13:20.041 --> 13:21.373
Everybody's happy.

13:21.375 --> 13:23.125
<i>Well, I am unhappy.</i>

13:23.127 --> 13:26.061
I thought where you come from
they don't have emotions.

13:26.063 --> 13:30.632
<i>I come from a factory</i>
<i>in Taiwan.</i>

13:31.534 --> 13:33.102
<i>Now, do the right thing.</i>

13:33.104 --> 13:34.770
You know what you are?

13:34.772 --> 13:37.923
Well, you're
a green-blooded buzz kill.

13:37.925 --> 13:40.425
Perhaps it's time
you beam on out of here.

13:40.427 --> 13:41.360
Fine.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.512
<i>I will just use</i>
<i>the transporter.</i>

13:43.514 --> 13:44.780
Oh, right.

13:44.782 --> 13:47.216
<i>You broke it.</i>

13:47.218 --> 13:49.401
Very well.

13:49.403 --> 13:52.488
Cooper to <i>Enterprise,</i>
one to beam up.

13:52.490 --> 13:54.623
Energize.

14:05.820 --> 14:08.771
Tiny Spock, help.

14:13.560 --> 14:14.977
Ready for lunch?

14:14.979 --> 14:16.428
Yeah, one sec.

14:16.430 --> 14:18.647
Oh, good.
Ma would've killed me

14:18.649 --> 14:22.017
if she found out
I broke my retainer.

14:23.453 --> 14:24.903
Hey, uh...

14:24.905 --> 14:27.305
can I run something by you?
It's about Lakshmi.

14:27.307 --> 14:29.191
Yeah, sure.
How are things going?

14:29.193 --> 14:30.993
We hit a couple
of bumps.

14:30.995 --> 14:32.161
She lives
over in Manhattan Beach,

14:32.163 --> 14:34.279
so it takes, like, an hour
to get there.

14:34.998 --> 14:36.715
And she's a lesbian.

14:36.717 --> 14:39.868
What do you mean,
"she's a lesbian"?

14:39.870 --> 14:42.121
Well, you know how
whenever you and I would try

14:42.123 --> 14:44.489
to hit on women in bars
and they'd blow us off

14:44.491 --> 14:46.675
and then we'd tell each other
they were probably gay?

14:46.677 --> 14:47.676
It's like that.

14:47.678 --> 14:50.662
Except this time, it's true.

14:50.664 --> 14:52.998
Then why did she even
go out with you?

14:53.000 --> 14:54.299
She was looking

14:54.301 --> 14:56.685
for a husband so she can
appear to be straight.

14:56.687 --> 14:57.936
And, you know,

14:57.938 --> 15:00.556
it sounded crazy
to me at first...

15:00.558 --> 15:03.675
but I'm actually
thinking about doing it.

15:03.677 --> 15:07.196
Okay, so the reason
that might sound crazy...

15:07.198 --> 15:09.565
is 'cause it's <i>crazy!</i>

15:09.567 --> 15:11.567
Look, Howard,
you're in a relationship.

15:11.569 --> 15:14.069
You know you have
to make compromises.

15:14.071 --> 15:16.789
Yes, but my compromises
are about which bedspread to buy

15:16.791 --> 15:19.408
or whose turn
it is to do the laundry,

15:19.410 --> 15:21.326
Bernadette's or my mom's.

15:24.998 --> 15:26.465
It's a great deal.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.200
We both get our parents
off our backs,

15:28.202 --> 15:30.803
I don't have to come home to an
empty apartment every night.

15:30.805 --> 15:33.472
Plus, once I'm married, I
can finally eat carbs again

15:33.474 --> 15:36.225
and let myself go.

15:36.227 --> 15:38.543
Why don't you
tell your parents

15:38.545 --> 15:40.929
you want to try
to find someone else?

15:40.931 --> 15:43.982
Maybe one who hasn't slept with
more woman than you.

15:43.984 --> 15:46.602
Because this one
wants to marry me.

15:46.604 --> 15:49.554
I might never find
another one who does.

15:49.556 --> 15:51.740
So you're seriously thinking
about marrying someone

15:51.742 --> 15:53.742
you're never gonna
have sex with?

15:53.744 --> 15:55.194
I can't believe your attitude.

15:55.196 --> 15:58.280
I thought you were in favor
of gay people getting married.

16:00.216 --> 16:02.534
Yes, to other gay people!

16:02.536 --> 16:06.722
Do you hear how
homophobic you sound?

16:46.996 --> 16:49.948
Oh, I don't want a broken toy.

16:52.886 --> 16:55.804
Nothing!

16:55.806 --> 16:57.306
What?

16:57.308 --> 16:59.508
Nothing. I said nothing.

16:59.510 --> 17:00.509
That was weird.

17:00.511 --> 17:02.844
Really? I don't
even notice anymore.

17:04.564 --> 17:06.798
I cannot believe you guys
aren't gonna play with these.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.800
Well, I told you, you don't.
It's mint-in-box.

17:08.801 --> 17:11.637
I don't know.
I just think it's a waste.

17:16.943 --> 17:19.644
Relax. I'm just
looking at the box.

17:19.646 --> 17:21.329
Perhaps you should
look with your eyes

17:21.332 --> 17:24.648
and not your muscular
Nebraska man hands.

17:24.651 --> 17:27.652
What is your problem?!

17:27.654 --> 17:30.822
My problem is that I don't want
you to break Leonard's toy.

17:30.824 --> 17:32.708
Which you probably
did by shaking it!

17:32.710 --> 17:35.544
She shook it,
we all saw her.

17:35.546 --> 17:36.845
Leonard, I bought you this

17:36.847 --> 17:38.880
'cause I wanted you
to have fun with it.

17:38.882 --> 17:40.849
I don't want it
to sit in this box.

17:40.851 --> 17:43.468
You know,
you're right.

17:43.470 --> 17:44.603
I mean,
it's from you,

17:44.605 --> 17:46.855
I'm never
gonna sell it.

17:46.857 --> 17:48.340
- I'm opening it.
- Yes!

18:00.119 --> 18:02.454
- It's broken.
- What?

18:02.456 --> 18:04.573
Oh, nice job, man hands!

18:05.524 --> 18:06.992
I didn't break it.

18:06.994 --> 18:10.078
I guess Stuart
sold it to me like this.

18:10.080 --> 18:12.664
Yes. Yes, he did.

18:12.666 --> 18:16.134
That is a perfectly satisfying
and plausible explana...

18:16.136 --> 18:17.853
Let's all be mad at Stuart!

18:18.871 --> 18:20.722
You know, I paid
a lot for this.

18:20.724 --> 18:22.540
Let's take it
over there and show him.

18:22.542 --> 18:24.026
Absolutely.

18:26.346 --> 18:27.729
Wait!

18:30.183 --> 18:32.401
It was me.

18:33.569 --> 18:35.737
I opened your toy...

18:35.739 --> 18:39.691
discovered it was broken
and didn't tell you.

18:39.693 --> 18:42.277
Why would you
open mine?

18:42.279 --> 18:44.496
I didn't. That was a lie.

18:44.498 --> 18:47.249
I opened my own toy...

18:47.251 --> 18:50.786
and it was already broken,
so I switched them.

18:50.788 --> 18:53.255
You should talk
to Stuart.

18:53.257 --> 18:55.357
I can't, because that was a lie.

18:56.592 --> 18:58.960
Yours was broken
in an earthquake--

18:58.962 --> 19:01.380
and that's a lie.

19:03.249 --> 19:05.083
What is the truth?

19:05.085 --> 19:07.853
My Mr. Spock doll
came to me in a dream

19:07.855 --> 19:09.604
and forced me to open it.

19:09.606 --> 19:13.692
And when the toy broke,
I switched it for yours.

19:13.694 --> 19:15.760
Later, he encouraged me
to do the right thing,

19:15.762 --> 19:17.095
and I defied him.

19:17.097 --> 19:20.399
And then I was attacked
by a Gorn.

19:23.669 --> 19:26.321
Okay, that I believe.

19:26.323 --> 19:28.773
Leonard, Penny, I just,
I want you both to know

19:28.775 --> 19:31.109
that I regret my actions
towards the two of you.

19:31.111 --> 19:33.111
That's a lie.

19:33.113 --> 19:35.664
So, is that one mine?

19:35.666 --> 19:36.665
Yes.

19:36.667 --> 19:38.750
Well, hand it over
so I can open it.

19:38.752 --> 19:40.385
Okay.

19:40.387 --> 19:43.121
And, Leonard, even though
I don't have one anymore,

19:43.123 --> 19:45.457
I hope you have fun
playing with it.

19:45.459 --> 19:48.310
And that's a lie, right?
It's a big, fat whopper.

19:49.795 --> 19:51.646
I hope it breaks.

19:56.989 --> 19:58.064
This is a treat.

19:58.065 --> 19:59.931
What brings
you guys by?

19:59.933 --> 20:03.284
Raj, Howie told me what's
going on with you and Lakshmi.

20:03.286 --> 20:04.819
You told her?

20:04.821 --> 20:07.255
I told everybody.

20:08.607 --> 20:10.158
We believe there's
someone out there

20:10.160 --> 20:11.660
who will love
you for you.

20:11.662 --> 20:13.528
Actually, we kind of
agreed to disagree

20:13.530 --> 20:15.580
on that one,
but we both think

20:15.582 --> 20:17.815
you shouldn't
marry this woman.

20:17.817 --> 20:20.818
So, while I'm waiting for
this mysterious perfect match

20:20.820 --> 20:24.172
who may or may not exist,
I'm supposed to just be alone?

20:24.174 --> 20:26.508
Not necessarily.
I think

20:26.510 --> 20:30.428
we found someone
for you to cuddle with.

20:30.430 --> 20:33.431
Oh, my goodness.

20:33.433 --> 20:37.668
Aren't you the cutest
little Yorkie ever!

20:38.854 --> 20:40.671
You got him for me?

20:40.673 --> 20:44.059
Her. We thought you two
would hit it off.

20:44.061 --> 20:45.510
I think we already have.

20:45.512 --> 20:47.345
Thank you guys so much.

20:47.599 --> 20:51.401
Let's go see
if you fit in my man purse.

20:53.173 --> 20:55.039
Heterosexual, my ass.
