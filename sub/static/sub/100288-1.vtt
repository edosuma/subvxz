00:13.179 --> 00:14.514
Mother?

00:19.519 --> 00:20.478
Mother?

00:21.646 --> 00:22.731
I had a nightmare.

00:24.774 --> 00:26.943
I saw them shoot him, in the dream.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.787
Mama, why did he die?

00:43.918 --> 00:46.212
Because that is what's
written in God's book -

00:47.922 --> 00:51.468
Say, "Nothing shall befall us,
except what God has ordained."

00:52.719 --> 00:54.679
Did God not love him?

00:56.014 --> 00:57.682
God loved him so much...

00:58.933 --> 01:03.021
He took him sooner than we wanted.

01:05.315 --> 01:06.983
Does God love me that much?

01:08.860 --> 01:10.195
Yes...

01:12.072 --> 01:14.324
but God has a different plan for you.

01:24.459 --> 01:25.752
<i>How will I know?</i>

01:31.674 --> 01:34.803
<i>He will reveal it to you</i>
<i>when you're ready.</i>

02:00.870 --> 02:01.871
Mama.

02:43.746 --> 02:46.249
Today, God gives us Damascus!

03:03.308 --> 03:04.475
Help us!

03:06.728 --> 03:08.271
We're trapped!

03:09.939 --> 03:11.524
Please let us out!

03:12.775 --> 03:14.235
We'll die here!

03:23.786 --> 03:25.163
Help us!

03:26.956 --> 03:28.166
Let us out!

03:32.295 --> 03:34.631
Jibril? When did you escape?

03:36.841 --> 03:37.884
Samer?

03:39.177 --> 03:41.137
They said you joined the rebels.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.598
Your family was worried about you.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.226
Where's your family?

03:59.822 --> 04:01.074
Listen to me!

04:02.116 --> 04:04.035
Listen to me, my brothers and sisters.

04:05.787 --> 04:09.457
They pretend to preach God's word,

04:10.375 --> 04:13.753
and all they do is twist its meaning.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.381
It is written in The Book.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.466
"They shall be held up to shame
in this world...

04:18.549 --> 04:22.095
they have incurred God's
most inexorable wrath...

04:22.178 --> 04:24.305
a shameful defeat awaits them!"

04:24.389 --> 04:25.974
A defeat awaits you!

04:26.057 --> 04:28.393
May the Devil swallow you up!

04:28.476 --> 04:30.812
I've looked the Devil in the eye.

04:31.646 --> 04:33.189
He cannot swallow me.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.693
It is written -
Say, "Nothing shall befall us,

04:36.776 --> 04:38.569
except what God has ordained."

04:41.155 --> 04:42.699
Say, "Nothing shall befall us,

04:42.782 --> 04:44.701
except what God has ordained."

04:47.912 --> 04:50.707
It is forbidden
to misquote the scriptures!

04:50.790 --> 04:52.333
Look at you.

04:52.417 --> 04:56.421
You've suffered more than anyone
on this earth.

04:57.839 --> 05:01.926
You're surrounded by enemies
who want to eradicate you.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.096
Load the artillery! Quickly!

05:05.888 --> 05:07.390
The sandstorm's upon us!

05:09.475 --> 05:14.689
Believe me when I say God
will defeat your enemies!

05:14.772 --> 05:17.275
Because God wants you to live.

05:17.358 --> 05:19.819
Mark my words!

05:19.902 --> 05:21.321
On this day, mark my words!

05:23.031 --> 05:25.491
God's hand will turn them away!

05:26.909 --> 05:28.619
Salvation is at hand!

05:31.080 --> 05:32.248
Everybody, get inside!

05:36.544 --> 05:37.920
Salvation is at hand!

05:42.550 --> 05:43.885
There is nothing to be afraid of!

05:48.598 --> 05:49.599
Heed my words!

05:50.725 --> 05:52.560
This is their last gasp...

05:53.311 --> 05:54.687
...their dying breath.

05:55.897 --> 05:59.859
Mark my words...

06:00.318 --> 06:01.819
the scale has tipped!

06:02.820 --> 06:03.988
History has ended!

10:17.074 --> 10:21.245
<i>Messiah! Messiah!</i>

10:50.941 --> 10:53.402
Messiah! Messiah!

11:15.591 --> 11:16.634
Imam?

11:18.552 --> 11:20.179
Where do you lead us, Imam?

11:21.555 --> 11:22.848
To our destiny.

15:00.983 --> 15:05.696
"If you look for truth,
you may find comfort.<i> </i>

15:07.281 --> 15:11.118
If you look for comfort,
you will never find truth."

15:14.455 --> 15:16.290
Why do you quote an infidel?

15:17.249 --> 15:20.336
Who are you to judge who's an infidel?

15:21.962 --> 15:23.088
People are hungry, Imam.

15:23.547 --> 15:24.798
Don't interrupt, boy.

15:26.342 --> 15:27.676
Why do you call me Imam?

15:29.470 --> 15:30.429
Because you are great.

15:32.431 --> 15:33.390
No greater than you.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.101
"There is no deity but God."

15:38.437 --> 15:40.856
But you turned away evil
as you said you would.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.483
He turned away evil.

15:46.028 --> 15:48.238
But He works through you.

15:49.156 --> 15:52.576
"Did He create you in jest?
Without purpose?"

15:54.578 --> 15:57.206
You expect a shoemaker's son
to know the scriptures?

15:59.708 --> 16:01.168
Do you serve God?

16:02.628 --> 16:03.462
Yes.

16:03.545 --> 16:06.131
Then He works through you.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.510
He works through everyone.

16:12.554 --> 16:17.559
You mean He works through all
who righteously follow Islam.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.522
Don't tell me what I mean.

16:31.949 --> 16:33.701
Why are there no women here?

16:39.373 --> 16:41.208
Surely you're not serious.

16:49.675 --> 16:52.845
Go find a woman
and give her your seat.

17:00.936 --> 17:02.062
This man is the Devil.

17:02.896 --> 17:04.857
He has led us into the desert
with no food.

17:06.191 --> 17:08.485
And to leave me now is to perish.

17:19.830 --> 17:23.459
I'm here to tell you to throw away
your assumptions about God.

17:24.626 --> 17:27.838
Stop clinging to what you think you know.

17:29.757 --> 17:32.509
In this hour,
mankind is a rudderless boat.

17:34.553 --> 17:35.846
Cling to me.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.816
What is he doing?

22:02.321 --> 22:03.822
Talking with God.

22:06.533 --> 22:07.534
He looks crazy.

22:08.535 --> 22:10.746
He stood for 30 days
on the Gate of St. Thomas

22:10.829 --> 22:15.834
and preached without food or water,
during the sandstorm,

22:15.917 --> 22:19.296
while we hid in a building,
fearing for our lives.

22:20.839 --> 22:23.842
You don't believe
he really did that, do you?

22:27.554 --> 22:29.014
He is Isa returned.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.185
al-Masih.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.270
Jibril!

22:56.083 --> 22:57.292
Sit down with me.

23:07.010 --> 23:09.137
Do you know there is a star
for every soul?

23:11.515 --> 23:12.849
Do you believe me?

23:16.019 --> 23:16.978
Yes.

23:20.899 --> 23:23.985
Imam...<i> </i>is my mother in a good place?

23:24.820 --> 23:26.822
She's where God wants her.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.074
She is with Him?

23:32.661 --> 23:34.162
Do you think...

23:35.497 --> 23:38.417
He would forsake a soul as good as hers?

23:39.418 --> 23:40.419
I miss her.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.505
I want to see her.

23:43.588 --> 23:46.883
It's good you're thinking about
the next life.

23:47.592 --> 23:49.136
Why have you come now?

23:49.678 --> 23:52.347
It's pointless to question these things.

23:53.098 --> 23:54.099
I'm here...

23:54.808 --> 23:58.145
in this moment because
I have always been here in this moment...

23:58.603 --> 24:00.105
and so have you.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.450
You have light in you, Jibril...

24:15.370 --> 24:17.873
but God is going to ask some hard things
of you.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.418
I am ready.

24:26.006 --> 24:28.008
Pack up the camp.<i> </i>We're moving.

24:40.812 --> 24:42.564
<i>Al-Masih!</i>

27:32.317 --> 27:33.985
He's led us to our deaths.

27:34.069 --> 27:35.737
He's led us into battle!

27:45.914 --> 27:47.123
Collect all the weapons.

28:09.688 --> 28:12.107
Imam, what do you want us to do?

28:15.527 --> 28:17.237
Dig a hole and bury them.

28:17.862 --> 28:19.364
Then how do we fight?

29:12.083 --> 29:13.084
What?

29:15.587 --> 29:17.589
We've got a crazy fucker.

29:26.848 --> 29:29.976
Hello there, crazy fucker.

30:14.187 --> 30:17.148
Patrol house 328ip.
Repeat 328ip.

30:17.232 --> 30:19.567
Request immediate reinforcement.

31:16.916 --> 31:18.376
Be strong.

31:19.168 --> 31:20.378
God is with you.

31:26.134 --> 31:28.803
Hands up!

31:28.887 --> 31:30.263
Hands away from your clothes!

31:30.346 --> 31:32.640
Get down!

31:32.724 --> 31:34.934
<i>-Hold fire!</i>
-Where the hell is reinforcement?

31:35.018 --> 31:36.394
These people need food.

31:36.477 --> 31:38.354
Lebanon is that way.

31:38.938 --> 31:41.649
Lay down on the ground. I said lay down!

31:41.733 --> 31:43.151
Hands up!

31:46.112 --> 31:47.280
Stand down.

32:00.835 --> 32:01.794
Arrest him.

32:06.299 --> 32:08.927
<i>The occupying forces have refused...</i>

32:09.010 --> 32:12.555
<i>the Palestinian refugees</i>
<i>entry back into their homeland,</i>

32:12.639 --> 32:14.140
<i>led by a man they call al-Masih.</i>

33:14.492 --> 33:16.995
-What are you doing?
-What's it look like?

33:17.412 --> 33:19.122
You can't just let yourself in.

33:20.206 --> 33:21.374
I pay for this place.

33:22.750 --> 33:24.043
There's my princess.

33:24.127 --> 33:25.420
Daddy!

33:25.503 --> 33:27.005
Let me look at you!

33:27.088 --> 33:28.214
I'm all sweaty.

33:29.340 --> 33:31.509
You're supposed to call
and let me know you're coming.

33:32.260 --> 33:33.136
They're the rules.

33:45.189 --> 33:46.399
This isn't a hotel.

34:00.246 --> 34:02.790
Oh, so you bothered this week?

34:02.874 --> 34:05.001
Have you got a job yet?

34:08.838 --> 34:11.758
Go get your coat, princess.

34:13.843 --> 34:14.761
Yeah?

34:17.305 --> 34:18.264
It's my day off.

34:20.099 --> 34:21.142
When?

34:35.448 --> 34:36.824
REFUGEE LEADER ARRESTED

36:31.689 --> 36:32.857
The Word.

37:48.182 --> 37:50.142
That will be revealed in time.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.619
No one needed
to tell me your name.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.289
You are in my father's book.

38:22.842 --> 38:25.970
You hold onto hatred like it's a prize,

38:27.596 --> 38:30.349
when it's the weight around your neck.

39:29.158 --> 39:31.369
He is waiting for you, Aviram...

39:32.953 --> 39:34.372
whenever you are ready.

39:57.395 --> 39:58.437
FILE DELETED

39:59.230 --> 40:00.731
Put him in the hole.

40:26.382 --> 40:27.967
Have you seen Omer?

40:29.677 --> 40:30.636
Why would I do that?

40:32.179 --> 40:33.806
Because he's your brother.

40:36.725 --> 40:39.353
He did something stupid.
I'm not going to take pity on him.

40:41.021 --> 40:42.690
I love your compassion.

40:45.693 --> 40:48.863
The country's crumbling
and he decides to rob a fucking store.

40:49.238 --> 40:50.739
He deserves what he gets.

40:56.662 --> 40:59.290
You're angrier than usual.

41:13.721 --> 41:15.014
You...

41:19.477 --> 41:21.770
You've never mentioned Megiddo
to anyone?

41:26.650 --> 41:28.319
Why would I do that?

41:30.196 --> 41:31.906
Why are you even talking about it?

41:37.578 --> 41:38.996
Nothing.

42:16.909 --> 42:19.745
Hey, thief. Give it back.

42:20.579 --> 42:21.747
Goodnight.
