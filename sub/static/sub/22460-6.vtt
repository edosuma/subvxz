00:18.080 --> 00:20.439
Nothing from Dobby since Christmas.

00:20.440 --> 00:22.319
I want to call again,

00:22.320 --> 00:25.319
but when I leave long messages,
I have this nagging sense

00:25.320 --> 00:28.159
that I'll end up hearing them played
back to me in a court of law.

00:28.160 --> 00:30.399
Don't stress it, man.
We'll have New Year's Dude, Darty style.

00:30.400 --> 00:32.839
Remember that time we were
coming back from Cinderella's

00:32.840 --> 00:35.359
and Pedge put his pants over the taxi
driver's head and he couldn't see a thing?

00:35.360 --> 00:39.159
That would have been more hilarious had
I not been literally weeping with fear.

00:39.160 --> 00:42.319
Come on, man, shake your booty.
Tonight even Paxman's out

00:42.320 --> 00:46.319
hoovering up lines of crank off Krishnan Guru-Murthy.
Tonight's the big one.

00:46.360 --> 00:48.999
Jeremy, all rational people
agree it's a truth self-evident

00:49.000 --> 00:51.199
that it's impossible to have a
good time on New Year's Eve.

00:51.200 --> 00:52.639
The pressure's too immense.

00:52.640 --> 00:56.639
All I want is to go to Johnson's,
find Dobby and sort everything out.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.999
OK, we'll go to Johnson's as a
stomach liner, a seat warmer.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.079
But then I'm taking you
on a poonani hunt!

01:02.080 --> 01:02.959
No, Jez.

01:02.960 --> 01:03.999
No, Jez.
Come on, man.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.719
Dobby's gone. Zahra's gone.

01:05.720 --> 01:06.639
DOORBELL RINGS

01:06.640 --> 01:09.279
Tonight it's not about the bitches,
it's all about the Hitches.

01:09.280 --> 01:13.279
The Hitches? You think we're Peter and
Christopher Hitchens on a big night out?

01:13.640 --> 01:16.239
And I suppose I have to be Peter.

01:16.240 --> 01:17.599
Zahra!

01:17.600 --> 01:19.639
I was in the area,

01:19.640 --> 01:20.919
thought I might pop by.

01:20.920 --> 01:22.119
Yeah?

01:22.120 --> 01:24.359
'That's the kind of bullshit I come up with.
Is she doing a me?

01:24.360 --> 01:27.639
'She still likes me! Or does she?
I need evidence, I need confirmation.

01:27.640 --> 01:29.439
'Quick. OK, here goes.'

01:29.440 --> 01:32.759
(LAUGHS) Jez!

01:32.760 --> 01:34.999
Sorry, that was probably
totally inappropriate.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.039
It's just sometimes, the
scent of a woman...

01:37.040 --> 01:41.039
OK, the truth is, I came here to tell
you that Ben and me, we're finished.

01:42.280 --> 01:45.519
I...I found out he slept
with someone else.

01:45.520 --> 01:48.239
God. Who would have sex with Ben?!

01:48.240 --> 01:50.399
Apart from you, obviously.

01:50.400 --> 01:52.519
He said he only did it because
he was missing me so much.

01:52.520 --> 01:53.959
But I'd only gone out to see a film.

01:53.960 --> 01:54.799
Jesus!

01:54.800 --> 01:58.079
Jesus! I know.
So I started thinking...

01:58.080 --> 02:01.959
We really had something, you and me.
We're the same, abit.

02:01.960 --> 02:05.439
Half a tub of cookie dough...

02:05.440 --> 02:08.119
And two films by Francois Truffaut.

02:08.120 --> 02:09.519
'I will never know what that means.'

02:09.520 --> 02:12.799
So I was wondering...
and this is completely crazy,

02:12.800 --> 02:16.319
but what would you think
about moving in with me?

02:16.320 --> 02:20.319
OK, wow. 'Don't say yes too quick,
don't say yes too quick.'

02:20.400 --> 02:21.199
Yes!

02:21.200 --> 02:23.679
Yes! Cos I really,
really like you, Jez.

02:23.680 --> 02:26.079
And Ben's going to
stop paying my rent.

02:26.080 --> 02:30.079
And I think we just click.
And we can do a direct debit, or whatever!

02:30.840 --> 02:34.719
Sure. I mean, Ben will definitely fire
me, but I'll just get another job.

02:34.720 --> 02:37.279
I could easily start my own
music merchandise website.

02:37.280 --> 02:40.319
I'm getting a laptop, so...
yeah, sorted.

02:40.320 --> 02:43.359
'I'm moving in! I'm going to be
the boyfriend who pays rent!

02:43.360 --> 02:45.999
'I'm her rent boy...
but not sucking cock in a phone box.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.719
'Eating pussy on a tumble dryer!'

02:47.720 --> 02:51.719
Fancy dress. It's like a joke for
people with no sense of humour.

02:53.720 --> 02:54.759
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

02:54.760 --> 02:58.759
Hello? ..Oh. Hi, Ben.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.799
So, listen, dude, listen...

03:01.800 --> 03:05.079
You know how women, when
they live together,

03:05.080 --> 03:07.799
their periodicals start
arriving at the same time,

03:07.800 --> 03:11.679
and how dogs come to
look like their owners?

03:11.680 --> 03:14.319
Well, I really wouldn't
want that to happen to us,

03:14.320 --> 03:17.559
so it actually looks like
I'm going to be moving out.

03:17.560 --> 03:21.559
Are you..? Has Super Hans been talking
about his kibbutz idea again?

03:22.200 --> 03:25.519
Cos I can assure you the State of Israel
will not allow a "kibbutz for hotties".

03:25.520 --> 03:29.519
No. Zahra's split up with Ben and
she's asked me to move in with her.

03:29.840 --> 03:32.919
Oh. Right. Wow.

03:32.920 --> 03:34.879
This is very abrupt.

03:34.880 --> 03:37.999
It might have been nice to not
take me to the Spaghetti House

03:38.000 --> 03:41.159
and buy me a carbonara, but at least...
you know.

03:41.160 --> 03:44.719
Dude, man, it's no biggie, you and me.
It was a phase.

03:44.720 --> 03:45.839
Bada bing, bada bye.

03:45.840 --> 03:47.599
Bada bing, bada bye.
Bada bing, bada bye?

03:47.600 --> 03:51.599
All things pass, you know?
We're born, we live, we die.

03:51.960 --> 03:54.999
Plus Zahra's getting a 3D TV, so it all
makes sense, if you think about it.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.959
Right, good. Congratulations.

03:57.960 --> 04:01.839
Johnson. Alan Johnson.

04:01.840 --> 04:05.199
'Wish I'd come as Bond instead of a
stupid fisherman from not even a film.'

04:05.200 --> 04:09.199
Wet suit. The full Bond.
I'm scuba diving again.

04:10.320 --> 04:12.679
Thank you, direct marketing.

04:12.680 --> 04:15.559
What have you come as?
Techno hippy street bum?

04:15.560 --> 04:18.959
I'm not actually wearing a costume,
Alan, so the joke's on you.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.879
Yes, I knew that, so
the joke's on you.

04:20.880 --> 04:24.879
Well, I didn't realise you knew that,
so it can't have been a very good joke.

04:24.880 --> 04:28.119
Happy New Year.

04:28.120 --> 04:30.159
So, listen. Really weird one -

04:30.160 --> 04:34.039
apparently a guy from Time Out
magazine turned up at Ben's party,

04:34.040 --> 04:38.039
and Ben says he wants to talk to me about
publishing a booklet on my blog posts.

04:38.160 --> 04:40.959
Your alphabetical lists
of French films?

04:40.960 --> 04:41.879
He thinks they're seminal.

04:41.880 --> 04:42.959
He thinks they're seminal.
Mm-hm.

04:42.960 --> 04:46.959
Don't you think there's a chance that
Ben might be trying to...reel you in?

04:47.240 --> 04:48.799
I'm not saying you're a fish.

04:48.800 --> 04:49.839
Don't you think they're good lists?

04:49.840 --> 04:53.039
Oh, no, they're great lists.
They're...long lists.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.399
Maybe they do want to publish them.

04:54.400 --> 04:58.319
Exactly. It's too big to miss.
See you later...housemate!

04:58.320 --> 05:01.199
'Ugh. Day one and the
housemate gets dicked over.'

05:01.200 --> 05:04.679
So...pretty good numbers.
Nailed a lot of the key players.

05:04.680 --> 05:05.759
Liam Kendrick in the house!

05:05.760 --> 05:07.359
Liam Kendrick in the house!
Hey!

05:07.360 --> 05:10.199
So are you still pissed
off with Big Suze?

05:10.200 --> 05:13.919
What? Fuck you. Why would I even be?
What a stupid thing to say, Mark.

05:13.920 --> 05:14.839
Sorry.

05:14.840 --> 05:18.119
If poor little bitch girl wants to have a
spoiler party all over my housewarming,

05:18.120 --> 05:20.199
why would I even give a shit?
Huh? Why?

05:20.200 --> 05:21.439
I don't know.

05:21.440 --> 05:25.439
Me neither. So, let's grab you a cool
can of Kronie and a bag of nuts.

05:26.400 --> 05:29.679
Or an ice cold, long-necked Bud.
Hubba-bubba!

05:29.680 --> 05:31.039
Alan, are you still...?

05:31.040 --> 05:35.039
Oh, yeah. Appletise.
Five years - clean and serene.

05:35.600 --> 05:38.439
Just cos you're looking
at some titties

05:38.440 --> 05:40.519
doesn't mean you have to
suck on the nip-nips, right?

05:40.520 --> 05:43.119
Thanks, Alan.
I'll get stuck into that later.

05:43.120 --> 05:45.919
Oh, come on, Mark!
A Beck's, a simple Beck's.

05:45.920 --> 05:49.919
Up on the South Downs, a haversack full of Beck's?
That's the dream, ain't it?

05:49.920 --> 05:52.359
I want to keep a clear head
for when I talk to Dobby.

05:52.360 --> 05:54.439
Do you think she might be here soon?

05:54.440 --> 05:56.399
I don't know, Mark.
We've been over this.

05:56.400 --> 05:59.199
She might pop in. Mmm.
Cold white wine. Ain't that fine?

05:59.200 --> 06:01.799
'Hmm. He's conned me to his party.

06:01.800 --> 06:04.399
'Cos it's hard to take a legal
position on "might pop in".

06:04.400 --> 06:08.399
'Anyone might pop in - Jeffrey Archer,
Hugo Chavez, Skinner and Baddiel.'

06:09.240 --> 06:12.999
Aye-aye, Captain Birdseye! (LAUGHS)

06:13.000 --> 06:16.999
What have you caught? Some mackerel?
Sexual herpes from bumming a tramp?

06:18.840 --> 06:22.319
'Your insults are absorbed by the
theoretical levity of the costume.'

06:22.320 --> 06:26.319
So come on, then. Is it true, Mark,
that you've had your dick in the Dob?

06:27.000 --> 06:29.039
You might say that, but I
couldn't possibly comment.

06:29.040 --> 06:32.159
What? Have you, Mark, had
your dick in the Dob?

06:32.160 --> 06:36.159
OK, yes. Yes, yes, I've
had my dick in the Dob.

06:36.720 --> 06:38.799
So what's an average night in?

06:38.800 --> 06:42.799
You sit around reading Superman
comics, sucking each other's cocks?

06:43.120 --> 06:45.119
'Just grin and take it.'

06:45.120 --> 06:46.399
I guess.

06:46.400 --> 06:48.119
She's a freak, isn't she?

06:48.120 --> 06:50.359
But what kind of freak?

06:50.360 --> 06:53.519
Is she a manimal or a bestselling
Flanimal, would you say?

06:53.520 --> 06:54.959
'Does he want an answer?'

06:54.960 --> 06:58.959
I guess she's more of a...
manimal than a...Flanimal.

06:59.360 --> 07:02.239
D'you hear that, Dobs?

07:02.240 --> 07:03.599
I'm a manimal?!

07:03.600 --> 07:05.399
I don't even know what a manimal is.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.639
He's a shape-shifting
crimefighter, Mark.

07:07.640 --> 07:11.399
You've had your dick in the Dob?
Fucking hell!

07:11.400 --> 07:15.279
Dobby! Wait! Where are you going?

07:15.280 --> 07:16.999
I dunno, maybe Super Hans's?

07:17.000 --> 07:20.039
Somewhere where people won't
slag me off behind my back.

07:20.040 --> 07:24.039
It was just party chat. I was only being
horrible about you to ease things along.

07:24.160 --> 07:26.039
You're such a dick.

07:26.040 --> 07:30.039
Look, I owe you a massive
apology for just now, and...

07:30.840 --> 07:31.959
'Is that my baby?'

07:31.960 --> 07:35.599
..and for Christmas, and...

07:35.600 --> 07:37.999
Mark, are you getting bored
of your own apology?

07:38.000 --> 07:40.959
I'm sorry...and...

07:40.960 --> 07:42.999
'It bloody is my baby. Is it?'

07:43.000 --> 07:43.799
And what?

07:43.800 --> 07:45.679
And what? Sorry, it's
just that I recognise...

07:45.680 --> 07:47.879
See you around, dickwad.

07:47.880 --> 07:49.759
No, Dobs, I...

07:49.760 --> 07:53.679
'My baby. Is...is that mad?

07:53.680 --> 07:57.199
'Has he followed me here in a
desperate plea for attention?

07:57.200 --> 08:00.079
'Or am I man-handling
a random humanoid?'

08:00.080 --> 08:02.319
Mark, is he all right?

08:02.320 --> 08:04.359
He fell out of his basket.
I rescued him.

08:04.360 --> 08:06.159
From the soft carpet
where he was asleep?

08:06.160 --> 08:10.159
What if someone with clogs on
had come in out of their face

08:10.840 --> 08:14.719
and marched around the room like
a horse, or, you know, anything?

08:14.720 --> 08:16.119
He was sleeping, Mark.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.239
I had to go upstairs and
talk to my brother.

08:18.240 --> 08:20.559
He's actually having
a really hard time.

08:20.560 --> 08:23.719
He even posted some pictures of
his scrotum on Facebook, so...

08:23.720 --> 08:26.639
I'm just saying that the
situation looks perilous.

08:26.640 --> 08:27.679
Uh-huh.

08:27.680 --> 08:31.679
'Great. Dobby's gone and I'm left with
my ex, who despises me, and my son,

08:32.200 --> 08:36.198
'who probably thinks Jeff's his dad while
I'm just some mad, landlocked fisherman.

08:37.960 --> 08:39.438
There ain't no party
like a Super Hans party!

08:39.440 --> 08:41.359
'Only if Dobby's here.'

08:41.360 --> 08:43.078
Let the poonani hunt commence!

08:43.080 --> 08:46.079
The hunt for poonani?
I thought you were moving in with Zahra.

08:46.080 --> 08:48.159
Exactly.
I've made a firm commitment.

08:48.160 --> 08:51.679
We're practically getting married, so
this is basically my stag do. Free pass!

08:51.680 --> 08:52.719
MUSIC BLARES

08:52.720 --> 08:56.719
If Dobby's here, I need to make it up
with a gesture, something extraordinary.

08:57.040 --> 08:58.999
I could offer to marry her.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.959
Always the marrying
with you, isn't it?

09:01.960 --> 09:03.519
Super Hans!

09:03.520 --> 09:04.999
Jez, man.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.719
Wow, it is rocking out.
..You, OK, dude?

09:08.720 --> 09:12.519
Yeah, yeah. It's just...i
n there. Fuck, man.

09:12.520 --> 09:13.479
Tasty?

09:13.480 --> 09:15.759
Why would people want to do that shit?
Why even go there?
