00:02.471 --> 00:04.494
- phone's for you.
- I didn't hear it ring.

00:04.495 --> 00:07.150
I was on another call.
I think it's Harvey.

00:07.151 --> 00:08.751
Well why didn't you say so.
Scat!

00:08.752 --> 00:10.752
I hate when she says that.

00:11.957 --> 00:12.728
Hello?

00:12.729 --> 00:14.129
- Hey Sabrina.
- Hi Harvey.

00:14.130 --> 00:16.404
- I've got a question.
- Sure, ask away.

00:16.405 --> 00:18.840
What page are we supposed
to read for Mr. Pool's class?

00:18.841 --> 00:22.805
Um just the chapter on digestion
up to the large intestine.

00:23.006 --> 00:24.206
Is that it?

00:24.207 --> 00:27.811
No. Actually I'm not
calling about homework,

00:27.812 --> 00:29.651
that was just an excuse.

00:29.969 --> 00:31.508
It was? For what?

00:31.509 --> 00:33.039
I really called to say,

00:33.040 --> 00:36.509
Sabrina I think you're
the prettiest girl in school.

00:37.192 --> 00:39.045
- You do?
- Yeah.

00:38.946 --> 00:41.010
And there's something
else I wanna tell you.

00:41.011 --> 00:43.122
- What?
- I like squid!

00:43.123 --> 00:45.546
I like it a lot!
Squid rocks!

00:45.547 --> 00:47.783
- Who is this?
- It's Harvey:he:he:he:he!

00:50.687 --> 00:51.725

01:22.555 --> 01:24.806
Sabrina, did you hear what I said?

01:24.807 --> 01:29.222
Sure! You were saying
something about... something?

01:29.223 --> 01:32.514
You're not paying attention.
You keep looking around.

01:32.515 --> 01:34.930
I was sort of expecting Harvey to show up.

01:34.931 --> 01:37.903
So er what were you
saying about... school?

01:37.904 --> 01:39.404
I wasn't saying anything about school.

01:39.405 --> 01:41.205
I was saying that if the soccer
team wins again tomorrow...

01:41.206 --> 01:43.819
Wait! Harvey here!
Pretend like we're talking.

01:43.820 --> 01:45.220
We are talking

01:45.221 --> 01:46.521
Hi guys!

01:46.422 --> 01:47.622
Hi Harvey.

01:47.623 --> 01:50.018
Sabrina, would you be up for
a game of foozball?

01:50.019 --> 01:52.479
Oh actually I was just talking to Emma.

01:52.480 --> 01:55.189
That's okay, you go and play.
I'll finish my story later.

01:55.190 --> 01:57.814
Good, because I really
wanna hear the end of it...

01:57.815 --> 01:59.899
and the beginning.

01:59.900 --> 02:02.301
Okay!
Let's foos!

02:03.254 --> 02:05.148
I lead forty:two to thirty:eight.

02:05.149 --> 02:06.883
Yeah but you're going down today.

02:07.084 --> 02:08.283
Ball up!

02:08.854 --> 02:09.924
Spin! Spin!

02:09.925 --> 02:11.125
You're on the ropes!

02:11.126 --> 02:12.126
Hey Harvey!

02:12.827 --> 02:13.827
Hi Libby.

02:13.828 --> 02:16.593
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAOAOAAAAAAAAAL!!!!

02:17.202 --> 02:18.294
What?

02:18.813 --> 02:20.050
Um goal.

02:22.271 --> 02:24.356
- Hey.
- Oh hi Sabrina.

02:24.357 --> 02:26.513
Oh Harvey called for
you about an hour ago.

02:26.727 --> 02:29.020
No he didn't,
I was just with him.

02:30.255 --> 02:32.318
He:he:he. Why do I never tire of it?

02:33.117 --> 02:36.736
So you were out with Harvey?
The two of you have a date?

02:36.737 --> 02:38.895
No, we were just playing foozball.

02:38.896 --> 02:41.408
Harvey's too oblivious
to ask me out on a date.

02:41.894 --> 02:44.306
I wish there was some way I
could get Harvey to notice me more.

02:44.307 --> 02:48.402
Well the best way to get someone's attention
is to be an interesting person.

02:49.937 --> 02:51.083
Gee let me think!

02:51.508 --> 02:53.765
What would make me more interesting?

02:54.093 --> 02:57.502
I know! What if I had supernatural powers
and could blow stuff up?

02:58.603 --> 03:00.581
Careful! A little close!

03:00.582 --> 03:03.684
Sabrina that is not the way
to get Harvey's attention.

03:03.685 --> 03:06.005
I know but it made me feel better.

03:06.661 --> 03:10.484
Look, If you want him to notice you
don't be so available.

03:10.485 --> 03:15.538
Get a hobby or a job.
When I was a girl I kept bees.

03:16.350 --> 03:18.023
I think I'll get a job.

03:19.475 --> 03:21.081
What kinda job are you looking for?

03:21.082 --> 03:22.988
Ah just something to keep me busy
on Friday nights.

03:22.989 --> 03:25.083
Yeah, I don't have a boyfriend either.

03:25.284 --> 03:26.284
Hey look!

03:26.285 --> 03:29.924
'Auditions today for a lovely
magicians assistant' That's perfect for me.

03:31.076 --> 03:32.328
Oh conceited!

03:35.064 --> 03:37.135
I'm here for the lovely
magicians assistant job.

03:37.537 --> 03:38.952
Well you're really not qualified.

03:39.053 --> 03:40.253
Aren't I lovely?

03:40.254 --> 03:43.464
Well yes, Justin, you are,
but you're not a girl.

03:43.465 --> 03:45.945
Well the sign didn't say
anything about being a girl.

03:46.972 --> 03:48.438
Would you be willing to wear sequins?

03:48.439 --> 03:49.939
- Sure!
- Slit up to here?

03:50.140 --> 03:51.140
No problem!

03:51.141 --> 03:53.980
Yeah well... You're too tall. Next!

03:53.981 --> 03:55.600
- I'll wear flats!
- Next!

03:56.334 --> 03:57.770
He'll love you shorty.

03:59.367 --> 04:02.585
Um I'm her for the magicians assistant job.
I'm Sabrina Spellman.

04:02.586 --> 04:04.531
I know. We're in English class together.

04:04.532 --> 04:05.732
- We are?
- Yeah!

04:05.933 --> 04:07.754
I sit three chairs behind you.

04:07.855 --> 04:11.098
Remember one day you
dropped your pen and I picked it up

04:11.099 --> 04:12.399
and you said 'thanks a lot'?

04:13.005 --> 04:14.607
...Yeah and then you said

04:14.657 --> 04:16.457
- 'You're welcome'?
- Right!

04:17.005 --> 04:19.017
Well you seem qualified.

04:19.219 --> 04:21.962
You're lovely,
not too tall.

04:21.963 --> 04:25.181
Now, do you have any experience of magic?

04:25.282 --> 04:26.182
A little.

04:27.426 --> 04:28.646
I prepared a trick.

04:28.647 --> 04:30.878
Well you're mostly there for misdirection
but go ahead.

04:33.845 --> 04:35.694
Abracadabra!

04:37.964 --> 04:40.974
That's like Vagas magic!
You've got the job!

04:41.375 --> 04:42.375
Cool!

04:47.600 --> 04:50.207
Hey, are you heading over to The Slicery?

04:50.208 --> 04:51.808
I can't, I have rehearsal.

04:52.488 --> 04:54.090
Rehearsal? Are you in a play?

04:54.191 --> 04:57.659
No. I got a job as the lovely assistant
in a professional magic act.

04:57.960 --> 05:02.450
Hey Sabrina! I heard you joined
Magic Joel's freak show.

05:02.451 --> 05:03.851
It's his world of wonder!

05:04.152 --> 05:06.983
Harvey, I'm heading over to The Slicery.
See you there?

05:06.984 --> 05:07.984
Sure.

05:10.026 --> 05:11.107
Are you comin'?

05:11.108 --> 05:13.373
Didn't you hear what I said?
I can't.

05:18.059 --> 05:19.874
This is where the magic happens!

05:20.467 --> 05:21.675
And the laundry.

05:21.876 --> 05:23.702
Do you wanna see me saw my dog in half?

05:23.803 --> 05:24.803
Your dog?

05:24.804 --> 05:27.123
I had to practice on something
before you came along.

05:27.324 --> 05:28.799
How did you get into magic anyway?

05:29.000 --> 05:31.660
The truth is I thought it
would make girls like me.

05:31.761 --> 05:32.961
And did it?

05:32.962 --> 05:35.824
See that's the tragedy,
girls hate magic,

05:36.425 --> 05:39.472
but I still do it because magic
makes me feel special,

05:39.673 --> 05:41.344
but I guess you wouldn't understand that.

05:41.345 --> 05:42.745
Actually I would.

05:43.546 --> 05:45.381
If only magic were real.

05:46.458 --> 05:50.774
Okay let's start.
The first illusion you will learn is...

05:51.758 --> 05:53.184
The assistant's revenge.

05:53.185 --> 05:56.217
Wow! My magic never involved
such large props.

05:56.218 --> 05:57.818
Well you're not a professional.

05:58.296 --> 05:59.343
Okay.

05:59.344 --> 06:01.344
Now before I show it to you,

06:01.435 --> 06:06.058
you must swear never to reveal
the amazing and mystifying secrets of magic.

06:06.059 --> 06:07.951
I swear I will never tell.

06:07.952 --> 06:08.952
The amazing and...

06:08.953 --> 06:12.433
And mystifying secrets of magic.
So er how does it work?

06:12.434 --> 06:13.634
Step in.

06:15.061 --> 06:18.334
Now I buckle the buckles
and lock the stocks...

06:19.056 --> 06:20.320
Are you almost done?

06:20.521 --> 06:22.809
You know my dog never complained.

06:22.810 --> 06:27.438
Now I close the curtain
and I walk around the back and presto!

06:27.839 --> 06:29.899
- Change:o!
- Aw! My foot!

06:29.900 --> 06:30.900
Sorry!

06:33.933 --> 06:36.161
Now say 'Isn't he amazing?'

06:36.262 --> 06:37.662
Isn't he amazing?

06:38.363 --> 06:40.782
Thanks.
Now close the curtain again.

06:43.134 --> 06:44.334
Open it again.

06:47.226 --> 06:48.473
Hey! Where'd you go?

06:48.574 --> 06:49.674
Hup! I disappeared!

06:50.675 --> 06:52.686
- Amazing!
- It's our big finale.

06:52.687 --> 06:54.719
let's talk wardrobe.

06:54.720 --> 06:57.604
I'm thinking a valour pant
suit with a plunging neck line.

06:57.805 --> 06:59.183
And what will you wear?

07:02.178 --> 07:03.526
You didn't have to walk me home.

07:03.527 --> 07:06.399
Well after rehearsal I always
had to walk my dog too.

07:06.863 --> 07:08.914
- Well, I'll see ya.
- But before I go.

07:11.330 --> 07:13.600
Isn't he amazing?

07:13.801 --> 07:14.801
For you.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.313
Thanks. See ya tomorrow.

07:18.217 --> 07:19.681
Oh! Watch me disappear!

07:21.593 --> 07:23.118
- Who was that?
- Joel.

07:23.219 --> 07:24.719
He seems like a nice boy.

07:24.820 --> 07:26.504
Yeah. Did Harvey call?

07:26.705 --> 07:28.722
I don't think so but check with the cat.

07:33.559 --> 07:35.511
Oh! I shouldn't have.

07:36.894 --> 07:40.495
Pick a card! Any card!
And I will amaze and astound you.

07:40.496 --> 07:42.768
You mean bother and bore me.

07:43.611 --> 07:45.306
Hi Harvey! Can I sit with you?

07:45.685 --> 07:46.955
What's wrong with your table?

07:46.956 --> 07:50.587
It's too close to Magic Joel.
I can't believe you're working with him.

07:50.914 --> 07:52.192
You're working with Joel?

07:52.193 --> 07:55.272
I told you I'm his lovely assistant.
You never pay any attention.

07:55.273 --> 07:58.352
Yes I do. You've got pudding right there.

08:01.063 --> 08:03.102
I hope this beautiful tie isn't valuable?

08:03.103 --> 08:05.527
Well it's my favourite tie but...
What are you doing!

08:05.728 --> 08:09.533
Magic Mr. Pool.
Magic to amaze and astound you.

08:09.534 --> 08:11.629
resto! Change:o!

08:12.906 --> 08:14.500
uh! How'd you do that?

08:15.480 --> 08:16.848
I think you made it cleaner.

08:18.036 --> 08:21.350
Mr. Pool, I'm going to make you
an offer that you con't refuse.

08:21.715 --> 08:24.442
...So Clare comes over.
You know Clare?

08:24.443 --> 08:25.443
No.

08:25.444 --> 08:27.889
Well she had the best story about Alice.
You know Alice?

08:27.890 --> 08:28.890
No.

08:28.891 --> 08:30.930
I'm telling the story anyway. You see...

08:30.931 --> 08:32.590
Sabrina! Sabrina! I have great news!

08:33.134 --> 08:34.817
Excuse me, business.

08:37.028 --> 08:39.837
Thanks to Mr. Pool
we've got our first big gig.

08:39.837 --> 08:41.537
It's tomorrow, here in the cafeteria.

08:41.538 --> 08:43.400
Alright! The cafeteria?

08:43.400 --> 08:44.401
Yeah!

08:44.402 --> 08:45.802
Do I have to wear a hair:net?

08:47.110 --> 08:51.739
Tomorrow evening then...
That sounds great. Okay. Bye.

08:53.801 --> 08:55.481
Who was that?
What's going on?

08:55.482 --> 08:57.544
I could only hear your side of the conversation.

08:58.383 --> 09:00.238
That was my old collage buddy.

09:00.239 --> 09:01.239
Gallilao?

09:01.440 --> 09:05.867
No. Ethan Bodiker,
he's coming over tomorrow night for dinner.

09:05.968 --> 09:07.964
h Zelda, you have a date.

09:07.965 --> 09:10.589
It's not a date,
it's dinner with a colleague.

09:10.590 --> 09:12.393
And you're welcome to join us.

09:12.394 --> 09:14.670
I'd rather die but thanks.

09:20.049 --> 09:22.077
Ta:da! What do ya think?
Do I look more interesting?

09:22.078 --> 09:25.235
You look like some cheesy
magicians assistant.

09:25.236 --> 09:28.920
His name is Joel! And when we perform
n the cafeteria tomorrow

09:28.921 --> 09:32.263
all eyes will be on us
and Harvey will have to notice me.

09:35.770 --> 09:37.832
What is Sabrina doing up there?

09:38.035 --> 09:40.046
Since when did she join a magic act?

09:40.047 --> 09:43.357
Behold! The linking rings
are un:linked!

09:45.173 --> 09:46.215
Un:linked!

09:47.805 --> 09:49.234
Still linked! Ha:ha!

09:49.806 --> 09:51.231
Isn't he amazing?

09:51.426 --> 09:53.230
Amazingly lame!

09:55.101 --> 09:56.125
I can't take the pressure.

09:56.126 --> 09:58.382
You can do this Joel.
Move onto the tie trick.

09:59.493 --> 10:04.279
Sir! May I have your tie so I can perform
a trick that will amaze and astound you?

10:04.280 --> 10:06.503
Why of course! I love this trick.

10:06.804 --> 10:08.926
Now I hope this tie isn't valuable.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.892
O:oh? You mean presto!

10:20.222 --> 10:21.858
No, I messed up.

10:21.859 --> 10:23.459
I cut the wrong part.

10:23.660 --> 10:26.664
You ruined my tie?
Grandpa's tie!

10:27.635 --> 10:29.108
Isn't he amazing?

10:29.109 --> 10:30.109
No!

10:31.853 --> 10:33.876
- Let's go to the big finish.
- Good idea.

10:34.672 --> 10:37.684
And now ladies and gentlemen
For the big finale

10:37.685 --> 10:40.241
I will make my lovely
assistant disappear!

10:41.141 --> 10:43.548
You know Sabrina really 
ound a perfect boyfriend.

10:43.849 --> 10:45.449
She and Joel are going out?

10:45.837 --> 10:47.310
That's what I heard.

10:47.311 --> 10:48.349
Alrghit!

10:48.866 --> 10:51.472
As you can see!
She could not to escape

10:51.473 --> 10:52.473
Now!

10:53.033 --> 10:56.005
Presto! Change:o!

11:02.779 --> 11:04.039
Leave him in there!

11:04.040 --> 11:05.858
Now Magic Joel will disappear.

11:06.644 --> 11:08.699
No wait! My pants are stuck!

11:09.000 --> 11:10.200
What do you mean?

11:10.201 --> 11:11.401
Oh I blew the trick!

11:11.402 --> 11:12.602
We'll make it work.

11:14.707 --> 11:15.928
No don't!

11:17.335 --> 11:19.884
See! Magic Joel has disappeared.

11:19.885 --> 11:22.203
Wow! How'd they do that?

11:22.661 --> 11:24.228
Magic I guess.

11:24.229 --> 11:25.429
Shows over!

11:25.969 --> 11:28.172
Joel! Joel, where are you?

11:28.173 --> 11:29.373
I'm right here.

11:29.574 --> 11:30.574
Where?

11:30.675 --> 11:31.920
In the stocks.

11:32.421 --> 11:33.648
What am I, invisible?

11:34.992 --> 11:36.284
Aw! My eye!

11:38.689 --> 11:40.635
You mean I'm actually invisible?

11:40.636 --> 11:42.508
- I don't know what happened.
- I do.

11:42.743 --> 11:46.021
All my hard work paid off.
My magic is real.

11:46.022 --> 11:47.222
It's real all right! Okay,

11:48.307 --> 11:49.785
now we have to change you back.

11:49.886 --> 11:52.152
Why? This is great!

11:52.253 --> 11:54.787
I can go anywhere.
I can do anything.

11:54.788 --> 11:56.188
I am Magic Joel!

11:57.300 --> 12:01.011
Joel? Joel? Joel! Where'd he go?

12:04.059 --> 12:06.150
Joel? Joel?

12:07.515 --> 12:08.606
Sabrina!

12:09.511 --> 12:10.497
Hi Harvey.

12:10.498 --> 12:12.638
I saw the show and I have a question.

12:12.639 --> 12:14.265
Oh I can't tell you how
the tricks are done.

12:14.466 --> 12:18.750
No I... Y'know I just wanted to know
if it was true that you and Joel are goin' out?

12:18.751 --> 12:20.151
- Yes!
- No!

12:20.352 --> 12:21.822
- Did someone say yes?
- Yes!

12:21.823 --> 12:22.908
No!

12:23.109 --> 12:26.116
I'm:I'm practising my
ventriloquism for the act.

12:26.117 --> 12:30.532
But er we'll talk later, right now I've got to um...
Go to Mr. Pool's room.

12:33.179 --> 12:34.423
I'm also doing mime.

12:38.475 --> 12:41.911
How dare you! You have no right
telling Harvey we're boyfriend and girlfriend.

12:41.912 --> 12:43.950
- Why not?
- Because we're not!

12:43.951 --> 12:45.819
I gave you a flower and you took it.

12:45.820 --> 12:47.237
That doesn't mean anything!

12:47.238 --> 12:49.433
Maybe not to you
but it does to me.

12:49.534 --> 12:52.612
Look, Joel, we have a business
relationship and that's it.

12:52.613 --> 12:54.213
But Harvey doesn't even notice you!

12:54.214 --> 12:56.656
I would worship you,
you'd be my everything.

12:56.857 --> 12:58.920
I don't wanna be your everything.

12:58.921 --> 13:00.815
Sabrina! What are you
doing in my classroom?

13:00.816 --> 13:02.901
Er I came to ask you a question.

13:02.902 --> 13:05.733
Ask away as I staple my tie back together.

13:06.034 --> 13:09.444
Okay, I:I wanted to know if
you enjoyed the magic show?

13:10.138 --> 13:13.798
Er not really.
Joel ruined my favourite tie.

13:14.243 --> 13:16.458
There's really something not right
about that boy.

13:17.366 --> 13:18.366
What's that!

13:18.709 --> 13:19.967
A gust of wind?

13:19.968 --> 13:22.170
In this windowless prison cell?

13:22.271 --> 13:25.074
Anyway, y'know I thought
you were really polished.

13:25.075 --> 13:27.627
My advice, lose Joel.
You don't need him.

13:27.628 --> 13:29.257
- Mr. Pool!
- Sabrina?

13:29.558 --> 13:30.647
Don't be so harsh!

13:30.648 --> 13:32.932
This magic things a
lot harder than it looks.

13:33.033 --> 13:34.916
Well, I'd better get going.

13:35.919 --> 13:37.005
Come on!

13:49.816 --> 13:50.894
Grandpa?

13:52.814 --> 13:53.852
Yello?

13:53.853 --> 13:56.675
Aunt Hilda you have to help me! 
turned Joel invisible.

13:56.676 --> 13:59.879
Calm down! You just need 
o give him a shot of visibility powder,

13:59.880 --> 14:01.280
it's right here in the cabinet.

14:02.477 --> 14:03.684
Can you bring it to me?

14:03.685 --> 14:06.047
You still don't get this witch thing do you?

14:06.048 --> 14:07.248
Are you alone?

14:07.449 --> 14:08.649
Pretty much.

14:10.958 --> 14:11.991
Got it.

14:11.992 --> 14:15.018
Just spray some in his face and he'll be fine.
See? No problem.

14:15.019 --> 14:17.035
No problem except now
I have to find him!

14:17.036 --> 14:20.730
Let's see. A sixteen year old 
invisible boy lose in a high school.

14:20.731 --> 14:21.931
Where would he go?

14:21.932 --> 14:22.932
Oh:no!

14:27.234 --> 14:29.698
Keep your shirts on!
Don't change!

14:29.899 --> 14:31.946
I smell smoke! RUN!

14:32.047 --> 14:34.057
Panic! Don't inhale!

14:36.668 --> 14:37.703
Mean!

14:38.377 --> 14:41.433
I knew you'd be here.
Look Joel, we need to talk.

14:41.779 --> 14:43.990
Did you come to tell me
you'd changed your mind?

14:43.991 --> 14:44.991
No!

14:46.256 --> 14:47.849
What are you doing with that talcum powder?

14:47.850 --> 14:49.250
I thought you might be chafing.

14:50.535 --> 14:53.535
I know you probably don't see much
in me right now but you will.

14:53.636 --> 14:56.932
I'll make you notice me Sabrina.
You wait and see.

15:02.304 --> 15:04.564
Ethan!
I'm so glad you came.

15:04.565 --> 15:08.393
Zelda, you look great!
You never seem to age.

15:08.394 --> 15:12.234
Well let's not talk about me,
let's talk about the search for monopoles.

15:12.235 --> 15:14.722
- Ah you've read my last paper!
- I couldn't put it down.

15:14.723 --> 15:15.747
Zelda!

15:16.534 --> 15:18.945
I'm late for my tea at the Harvard club!

15:21.105 --> 15:22.918
- Are you Ethan?
- Yes.

15:22.919 --> 15:24.119
Oh my God!

15:24.783 --> 15:26.020
Excuse me.

15:26.414 --> 15:28.240
What's going on?

15:28.660 --> 15:31.677
It's stuck! Why didn't you tell me
Ethan was cute?

15:31.678 --> 15:34.698
Well I don't think about the way
e looks, I think about the way he thinks.

15:34.699 --> 15:35.899
I think he's cute!

15:35.900 --> 15:38.564
Weren't you going to Harvard for some tea?

15:38.565 --> 15:41.223
No stupid! I was making fun of you. Oh!

15:43.006 --> 15:45.575
Now I'm staying here.
How's my hair.

15:46.210 --> 15:47.851
You have brain head.

15:48.859 --> 15:50.146
Where've you been?

15:50.247 --> 15:51.447
Looking for Joel.

15:51.748 --> 15:53.048
I haven't seen him.

15:53.249 --> 15:54.449
Me neither.

15:54.450 --> 15:56.300
Hi Sabrina. Can I sit here?

15:56.301 --> 15:57.301
Sure!

15:57.302 --> 15:59.149
I wanna hear more about your ventriloquism.

15:59.150 --> 16:00.810
You talk with your stomach right?

16:00.811 --> 16:02.011
Harvey's a loser!

16:02.412 --> 16:03.612
Who said that?

16:03.613 --> 16:05.013
Er my stomachs grumbling.

16:07.393 --> 16:08.597
That's it!

16:09.306 --> 16:10.384
Where are you?

16:12.345 --> 16:13.745
When I get my hands on you!

16:15.584 --> 16:16.634
Sabrina?

16:17.692 --> 16:18.710
...Gotta go!

16:19.641 --> 16:21.117
But you have to factor in,

16:21.118 --> 16:24.344
quarks remain forever trapped
in the particles they create.

16:24.445 --> 16:25.645
I know the feeling.

16:25.646 --> 16:28.731
Yes but now:a:days all physics
is sub:atomic physics.

16:28.732 --> 16:31.597
I mean between the bosons and
the leptons and the quarks...

16:31.598 --> 16:34.486
Since you took a breath I thought
I'd jump in with a new topic.

16:34.487 --> 16:36.488
What's your favourite Bruce Willis movie?

16:37.047 --> 16:39.266
- I don't now, 'Die Hard'
- One, two or three?

16:39.267 --> 16:41.768
- Weren't they all the same?
- No. Actually two is very different.

16:41.769 --> 16:44.908
Hilda, sister dear. Why don't you
make like an atom and split?

16:45.109 --> 16:47.189
Fine! I can take a hint.

16:47.441 --> 16:49.703
I'll leave you alone to discus your little quirks.

16:49.704 --> 16:51.512
- It's quarks.
- I meant quirks!

16:52.542 --> 16:54.636
- Don't talk, bad night!
- Know the feeling!

16:57.192 --> 16:58.821
Thank goodness that she left.

16:58.822 --> 17:02.360
Now we can talk about the first
millisecond after the big bang.

17:02.361 --> 17:04.377
- See I think...
- Love me!

17:04.378 --> 17:06.459
- What!
- I'm sorry.

17:06.460 --> 17:10.137
é que finalmente vimo-nos
livre da tua irmã esquisita...

17:10.138 --> 17:12.184
It's just that we finally get rid of your weird
sister and all you can talk about is the big bang?

17:12.647 --> 17:15.510
 came here tonight hoping for more than science.

17:15.911 --> 17:20.180
I wanted you to look into my eyes and see something
other than rods and cones.

17:21.093 --> 17:23.656
I love you Zelda.
Don't you realise that?

17:23.656 --> 17:25.057
You never said anything.

17:25.157 --> 17:27.452
I've been playing footsie with you all night!

17:27.453 --> 17:30.344
That was you! I thought it was the cat.

17:30.645 --> 17:33.882
What's the point?
This is too humiliating.

17:34.446 --> 17:35.740
I can't let him go.

17:36.094 --> 17:37.391
Slippery floor!

17:41.515 --> 17:43.205
- Are you okay?
- What happened?

17:43.206 --> 17:44.406
Slippery floor.

17:44.607 --> 17:45.607
I'll get it.

17:47.990 --> 17:49.607
What are you doing down there?

17:49.608 --> 17:50.808
Slippery floor.

17:51.674 --> 17:54.747
And now we're going back
into the dining room.

17:54.948 --> 17:56.776
It's um time for dessert.

17:56.777 --> 17:58.803
- Dessert?
- Yes, dessert.

17:59.066 --> 18:01.337
Oh good. I:I like dessert.

18:05.606 --> 18:06.835
Animals!

18:10.445 --> 18:11.743
Hello, who are you?

18:11.744 --> 18:13.611
I'm Harvey. Is Sabrina here?

18:13.612 --> 18:15.702
Oh come in. So you're Harvey.

18:15.937 --> 18:17.799
Salem, Go get Sabrina.

18:17.800 --> 18:19.642
Why do I have to be the one?

18:20.692 --> 18:21.969
I have a few questions.

18:24.456 --> 18:26.511
Hey Sabrina, guess who's here?

18:26.512 --> 18:28.996
- Very funny.
- No really, Harvey's here.

18:28.997 --> 18:30.264
Harvey's here?

18:34.470 --> 18:36.163
- Hi Harvey.
- Hi Sabrina.

18:37.538 --> 18:38.821
I'll leave you two alone.

18:39.022 --> 18:40.222
Take the cat!

18:44.397 --> 18:46.270
So er what are you doing here?

18:46.271 --> 18:50.087
I was worried about you. I noticed
that you sorta lost it at The Slicery.

18:50.671 --> 18:51.488
You noticed?

18:51.489 --> 18:54.045
Yeah and I wondered if maybe
you were mad at me?

18:54.146 --> 18:55.346
No, I'm not mad.

18:55.647 --> 18:59.092
Good, 'cause I was thing that maybe
y wa..a g.. da..e e?

18:59.293 --> 19:00.293
What?

19:00.294 --> 19:02.108
Oh don't make me say it again!

19:02.109 --> 19:03.509
I swear I didn't hear you.

19:04.234 --> 19:07.489
Do you wanna go out with me?
Like on a date?

19:08.397 --> 19:12.694
Like a real date? I:I'd love that!
Yeah er when?

19:12.895 --> 19:14.295
- Now?
- Let's go!

19:16.068 --> 19:19.979
Wait. I should change first.
Hang here, I'll be right back.

19:20.308 --> 19:22.515
Actually! I'm going to wait in my car.

19:22.516 --> 19:24.735
I'm afraid your aunt'll keep asking me questions.

19:24.736 --> 19:25.936
Okay, meet you out front.

19:27.982 --> 19:30.001
- Hi Sabrina.
- Joel?

19:30.822 --> 19:33.641
I totally forgot about you.
How did you get here?

19:33.642 --> 19:34.842
I came in with Harvey.

19:34.943 --> 19:36.590
Did you notice he noticed me?

19:36.591 --> 19:38.943
Yeah! So I guess I'm out of the running.

19:38.944 --> 19:43.108
Joel, you never were...
Yeah, you're out of the running.

19:43.109 --> 19:44.709
I wish you liked me Sabrina.

19:45.766 --> 19:48.786
I do Joel,
just not in the way you want me to.

19:49.249 --> 19:50.921
But I like talking magic with you.

19:51.345 --> 19:52.422
You do?

19:52.423 --> 19:55.606
Yeah. Look, are you anywhere near my face?

19:56.028 --> 19:57.604
Actually, I'm at the piano.

19:57.705 --> 19:59.323
Oh I didn't know you liked the piano.

19:59.812 --> 20:01.295
I thought it'd make girls like me.

20:01.296 --> 20:02.296
And did it?

20:02.297 --> 20:04.314
No. Girls like guitars.

20:05.496 --> 20:09.349
Hey er wait here. Play! I've got
to grab something in the kitchen.

20:15.462 --> 20:16.749
Wow! You're good.

20:16.973 --> 20:18.250
- You think?
- Yeah.

20:21.249 --> 20:23.144
- What are you doing!
- I'm undoing,

20:23.345 --> 20:24.545
and you know Joel?

20:24.546 --> 20:27.042
Someday some girl will
appreciate all your hard work.

20:27.043 --> 20:30.340
Maybe not in high school
but I'm sure by late college.

20:30.799 --> 20:33.069
Well, I'd better get going.

20:33.070 --> 20:35.094
So I:I guess this is it?

20:35.095 --> 20:36.177
I guess.

20:36.978 --> 20:39.294
No wait! We have English class together.

20:39.295 --> 20:41.125
Oh right! So I'll see ya tomorrow.

20:41.126 --> 20:42.326
Yeah, see ya.

20:43.755 --> 20:44.991
What's going on?

20:45.840 --> 20:47.387
- Who are you?
- I'm Joel.

20:48.868 --> 20:50.114
You can see me?

20:50.115 --> 20:52.717
Yes and you're not wearing any pants.

20:58.923 --> 21:01.536
Joel! What are you doing in here?

21:01.537 --> 21:04.192
- Oh! You can see me?
- No, you're invisible.

21:04.193 --> 21:05.676
- I am?
- No!

21:05.677 --> 21:07.553
Get out or I'm telling coach Sapho.

21:07.554 --> 21:09.650
Man! I thought for sure I'd got it right.

21:09.751 --> 21:12.627
I was Magic Joel once and I will be again.

21:12.628 --> 21:13.628
GET OUT!

21:16.052 --> 21:17.311
I hate magic.

21:21.645 --> 21:24.541
Hello?
Oh hi Ethan...

21:24.642 --> 21:26.256
Oh well you're welcome...

21:27.891 --> 21:31.501
