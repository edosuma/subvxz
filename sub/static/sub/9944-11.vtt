00:05.660 --> 00:08.173
Come and watch pikeys making a mess

00:08.260 --> 00:11.855
of the lives they were given by
'im upstairs...

00:11.940 --> 00:14.898
And kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:14.980 --> 00:16.094
Wicked!

00:16.180 --> 00:17.499
Piss off!

00:17.580 --> 00:21.368
What sounds on Earth
could ever replace

00:21.460 --> 00:24.497
kids needing money
or wives in your face?

00:24.580 --> 00:26.935
Cos this, people reckon -
me included -

00:27.020 --> 00:29.488
is why pubs and drugs

00:29.580 --> 00:31.172
were kindly invented...

00:31.260 --> 00:33.774
To calm us all down
and stop us going mental.

00:33.860 --> 00:38.570
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:38.660 --> 00:44.815
We are worth every penny
for grinding your axes...

00:44.900 --> 00:46.379
You sit on our head,

00:46.460 --> 00:49.133
but... you pay the taxes.

00:49.220 --> 00:50.619
CHEERING

00:50.700 --> 00:53.373
Imagine Britain
without Chatsworth buccaneers

00:53.460 --> 00:56.691
who'd come on your face
for the price of a beer, eh?

00:56.780 --> 00:58.259
Eh!

00:58.340 --> 01:02.094
Make poverty history.
Cheaper drugs now!

01:02.180 --> 01:07.049
Make poverty history!
Cheaper drugs now!

'You don't choose your family.

'They're your gift. Or your burden.

Police! >

01:53.020 --> 01:55.011
A positive outrage.
I play golf with the chief constable.

See you in an hour, Mimo.

01:59.900 --> 02:03.131
Solicitor's waiting at the station, Squirrel.

02:03.220 --> 02:04.175
...Cow.

02:04.260 --> 02:06.899
Why didn't they nick me? I'm a face.

02:06.980 --> 02:08.776
You knew?

02:13.500 --> 02:16.890
Give this to our Mandy.
I've done the stock take,

02:16.980 --> 02:19.369

Conjunctivitis.

02:37.940 --> 02:40.613
- All of them?
- That's a lot of drugs, even for him.

02:40.700 --> 02:43.533
He must have sensed them.
I went in there, watched Supernanny,

02:43.620 --> 02:46.180
sneaked upstairs. He must have
inhaled them. I don't know.

02:46.260 --> 02:48.535
- He's a one.
- Where is he?

02:51.220 --> 02:52.653
Ooh...

We're gonna owe your mum gitloads.

02:59.300 --> 03:02.098
I'll have a word.
She'll want something, though. Deffo.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.615
You don't earn that much selling these.

03:08.700 --> 03:11.453
You said it was £250 a pop.
Someone's making some money

03:11.540 --> 03:14.008
out of them shit-suckers.

03:14.100 --> 03:15.772
Bollocks!

03:15.860 --> 03:18.215
Can you find out how much we owe her?

03:18.300 --> 03:21.133
I'll see what I can do.

03:26.180 --> 03:28.250
Are we straight?

03:28.340 --> 03:29.853
Have I cleared my debt?

03:29.940 --> 03:33.091
You are in hock till I say... Sergeant.

03:34.980 --> 03:37.540
Why didn't they search
our gaff, Sergeant?

03:38.620 --> 03:40.292
I only knew about the raid.

03:40.380 --> 03:43.497
Why am I still here, Sergeant?

03:43.580 --> 03:45.935
I really don't know.

03:52.220 --> 03:53.539
Hey, Carrie. >

03:53.620 --> 03:56.817
- Sarge is the traditional title.
- You are joking?

03:56.900 --> 03:59.539
Before, I was a natural leader.
Now, I'm appointed.

03:59.620 --> 04:02.817
Tell me again why they
let you resit your exam.

04:04.780 --> 04:07.294
You're under surveillance, Constable.

04:19.260 --> 04:22.058
Oh, a V.

04:23.180 --> 04:26.934
As in very, very lucky
to have me on your side, Sergeant.

04:27.020 --> 04:30.410
I'm looking forward to
getting acquainted with you.

04:30.500 --> 04:33.014
As agreed.

04:33.100 --> 04:35.978
- Wanna sit in on the Maguire powwow?
- Yeah!

04:37.340 --> 04:38.614
Where's my solicitor?

04:38.700 --> 04:43.694
Making him wait. Banging away
with his little fat fists. Most amusing.

04:43.780 --> 04:46.374
Fancy an afternoon at the flicks?

04:46.460 --> 04:50.897
Prescription drugs,
all-night chemist's. Two perps.

04:50.980 --> 04:53.369
Little muscles threatens
to cut chemist's hand off.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.451
Chemist gives in. Well, you would.

04:55.540 --> 04:57.929
Leads them in back for t'stuff.

04:58.020 --> 04:59.772
The other one, the leader,

04:59.860 --> 05:03.409
has got indigestion.
Helps himself to some tablets.

05:03.500 --> 05:07.413
Safe, though,
cos he knows where the cameras are.

05:09.820 --> 05:11.697
Or does he?

05:11.780 --> 05:16.808
What if they'd fitted a new camera
the day before?

05:17.700 --> 05:19.816
Eh?

05:24.540 --> 05:27.259
Bang to fuckin' rights.

05:27.340 --> 05:30.457
You're not obliged to say anything,
but we'd like it if you did

05:30.540 --> 05:33.100
cos we could do with a fuckin' laugh.

05:33.180 --> 05:34.977
20 years?

05:35.060 --> 05:36.891
I can't... >

05:36.980 --> 05:38.698
I can't live without...

05:41.580 --> 05:44.572
We could die at our age. Die apart.

05:44.660 --> 05:48.016
That's not the plan. I can't do that.

05:48.100 --> 05:50.330
Fat Todd says I should plead guilty.

05:50.420 --> 05:54.618
Fat Todd? We only went with him
cos of his poncey card.

05:54.700 --> 05:56.418
We can do better than him. We can.

05:56.500 --> 05:59.298
I'll cop a plea.
Good judge, serve half.

05:59.380 --> 06:00.813
Out in ten.

06:04.940 --> 06:06.373
(Christ.)

06:10.180 --> 06:11.898
No.

06:11.980 --> 06:13.174
Noel.

06:13.260 --> 06:17.936
Noel. Think about it.
We could do something with him.

06:20.620 --> 06:24.249
I'd rather serve 20 without remission
than speak to that. No!

06:24.340 --> 06:26.615
We need him. He can get you off this.

06:26.700 --> 06:28.611
Do you hear me?!

06:28.700 --> 06:32.215
I've cut him off like a dead fucking limb.

06:32.300 --> 06:34.291
He's no part of me.

06:36.140 --> 06:37.175
< (Tom) You all right there?

06:37.260 --> 06:38.818
Fucking rot then!

06:38.900 --> 06:40.936
I'm not waiting for you!

06:45.020 --> 06:46.817
Mum's too upset to talk.

06:46.900 --> 06:49.334
Having a bit of family bother.

06:49.420 --> 06:53.459
Very bad timing on Frank's part.

06:53.540 --> 06:57.692
I have managed to persuade her
not to burn your house down.

06:57.780 --> 07:00.135
But you do owe her three grand.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.653
Pay up.

07:01.740 --> 07:03.173
Fast.

07:07.660 --> 07:10.493
Good job Mandy's here to protect us,
she'll see us right(!)

07:10.580 --> 07:12.138
Me dad's goin' down.

07:12.220 --> 07:14.051
She's not as malleable as normal!

07:14.140 --> 07:15.573
Shit!

07:15.660 --> 07:17.537
What are we gonna do?

07:17.620 --> 07:19.929
Only one thing to do.

07:20.900 --> 07:23.698
Borrow it off mates who are minted.

07:27.620 --> 07:30.214
- (Lillian) Have you seen it?
- It woke me up.

07:30.300 --> 07:32.768
- Everyone's heard the bugger.
- What's up?

07:32.860 --> 07:37.012
- Lillian's lost her rooster.
- Goddammit, I'm gonna bomb your village!

07:37.100 --> 07:40.251
Can't call it a cock in our house.
Cause all manner of palaver.

07:40.340 --> 07:43.537
Only got it for Latvian girl. Thought
it might make her feel more at home.

07:43.620 --> 07:45.292
She's allergic.

07:48.100 --> 07:49.055
I need a favour.

07:49.140 --> 07:50.289
Yeah?

07:52.100 --> 07:54.250
I feel a right twat.

07:54.340 --> 07:57.491
I need a loan. Three grand.
My dad's had your mum's drugs.

07:57.580 --> 07:59.218
It's an emergency.

07:59.300 --> 08:00.449
We can't do it, mate.

08:00.540 --> 08:02.895
Please. I've seen the safe,
I know you've got it.

08:02.980 --> 08:05.619
It's all gone. Deposit for a kitchen.

08:05.700 --> 08:07.452
Doing the Thai food thing.

08:07.540 --> 08:09.849
Three grand's not that much
and it is going to your family.

08:09.940 --> 08:12.693
Sorry. We know you're good for it.

08:12.780 --> 08:16.295
We would. We really would, but...

08:16.380 --> 08:18.450
Pot's dry.

08:21.300 --> 08:23.018
New staff. Victor.

08:23.100 --> 08:26.137
He's a cook. You know, with you off travelling.

08:26.220 --> 08:27.414
I'm not going for ages.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.377
< Sorry.

08:29.460 --> 08:32.816
We'll still need you for
loads of shifts. Plenty of work.

08:35.260 --> 08:38.457
Here y'are, mate.
Have one on the management.

08:38.539 --> 08:41.452
They're not just my bosses,
they're my mates.

08:41.539 --> 08:45.249
No such thing. Capital, labour.
Cast off your chains. Us and them.

08:45.340 --> 08:48.138
I'm still with them.

08:48.220 --> 08:49.448
Class traitor, are you?

08:49.540 --> 08:50.689
Piss off.

09:00.500 --> 09:03.458
Suction central. One of your gents
slaps this on for a posh wank,

09:03.540 --> 09:05.656
he won't need a hospital,
he'll need a morgue.

09:05.740 --> 09:07.298
Will it vac up chicken poo?

09:07.380 --> 09:10.372
It's strong enough for human cack.

09:10.460 --> 09:13.099
Actually, that might be handy.

09:13.180 --> 09:15.091
I need to launder some bills.

09:20.540 --> 09:23.259
Bye, love. Filled your boots, eh?

09:23.340 --> 09:24.534
That mine, then?

09:24.620 --> 09:27.657
No, that's the demonstrator.

09:27.740 --> 09:30.652
You get a brand-new one.
Firm'll deliver it.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.616
Give me that fucking money!

09:46.540 --> 09:48.770
IAN GROANS

09:51.660 --> 09:56.415
Great fire will surely rain down
upon them and smite...

09:56.500 --> 09:57.899
Shut up.

09:57.980 --> 10:00.938
Think, Shane.

10:03.380 --> 10:07.214
He's not even gone down yet
and they are putting the squeeze on us.

10:07.300 --> 10:08.779
- What's next?
- War.

10:08.860 --> 10:12.170
No. We're nothing without your dad.

10:12.260 --> 10:13.454
Are you scared?

10:13.540 --> 10:16.850
Of course I am. I'm not stupid.

10:23.900 --> 10:25.413
Been robbed.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.695
Took my cash, the demonstrator...
We're totally screwed.

10:27.780 --> 10:28.769
What are we gonna do?

10:28.860 --> 10:31.055
Can't borrow the money, can't earn it.

10:31.140 --> 10:33.608
No, this isn't gonna happen.
I'm not gonna let it.

10:33.700 --> 10:35.179
It's time for us to all muck in.

10:35.260 --> 10:38.218
Work? In my condition?

10:38.300 --> 10:39.938
Right, yeah, I'm the dickhead.
It's my fault.

10:40.020 --> 10:41.294
Dad's.

10:41.380 --> 10:45.055
We all need to chip in.
Mimi has to be paid. Yeah?

10:45.140 --> 10:46.858
Yeah.

10:46.940 --> 10:48.498
(Debbie) Carl?

10:48.580 --> 10:49.012
Yeah.

10:49.100 --> 10:50.215
(Debbie) lan?

10:50.300 --> 10:52.018
Right. Come on, let's get to work!

10:52.100 --> 10:53.499
Oh, yeah!

10:53.580 --> 10:55.775
None of the kids can deal while you're on bail.

10:55.860 --> 10:59.648
Business on hold.
How are we gonna manage?

10:59.740 --> 11:00.695
We'll find a way.

11:00.780 --> 11:01.735
I'm not getting involved.

11:01.820 --> 11:04.380
Neither am I.

11:04.460 --> 11:06.928
We're going down the pan.

11:07.020 --> 11:09.818
Only one chance.

11:09.900 --> 11:11.094
I can't do that.

11:11.180 --> 11:12.454
Why not?

11:12.540 --> 11:15.498
Mind your own business.

11:15.580 --> 11:16.649
Mum's rang Noel.

11:16.740 --> 11:21.416
If you ask him yourself,
he'll drop everything and come.

11:21.500 --> 11:26.210
- You rang him?
- I've got to help you! What else can we do?!

11:37.740 --> 11:39.332
I can't do it.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.019
Not even for you.

11:48.220 --> 11:51.212
You out? Your brief's better than I thought.

11:51.300 --> 11:52.415
Shut your mouth, bitch. I own you.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.695
Not much point owning me
where you're going.

11:54.780 --> 11:58.329
And I can't do anything to stop that, <i>boss.</i>

12:11.140 --> 12:13.449
KEYPAD TONES

12:13.540 --> 12:16.054
HE SIGHS

12:20.780 --> 12:22.213
It's me.

12:24.820 --> 12:28.017
I need your help, and it's <i>not</i> a kidney.

12:28.100 --> 12:30.568
Please, Noel.

12:39.140 --> 12:40.778
What? You'll consider me? Really?

12:42.260 --> 12:46.890
I've got absolutely no experience,
and I'm very preggie.

12:49.260 --> 12:51.490
Oh, what a shame!

12:51.580 --> 12:53.377
No, don't worry about it.

12:53.460 --> 12:56.293
Soon as you mention that, brick wall!

12:56.380 --> 12:59.213
Mm, yeah. There should be a law.

13:00.820 --> 13:02.697
Phew...

13:04.860 --> 13:05.929
I need another demonstrator.

13:06.020 --> 13:08.818
In this scenario,
I will be willing to sell you another.

13:08.900 --> 13:13.018
Special circs etc.
All we need is £100

13:13.100 --> 13:17.013
and, before you know it,
the cash lorry's backing into your depot.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.818
Beep, beep, beep.

13:18.900 --> 13:21.812
I'm skint! Can I get an advance?

13:21.900 --> 13:24.539
Company policy. Hands tied.

13:30.100 --> 13:31.738
Hey, get off if you want.

13:31.820 --> 13:34.380
Come back tonight.
I know you need to get settled.

13:34.460 --> 13:36.257
Yeah, I do.

13:36.340 --> 13:37.534
You're all right, then?

13:37.620 --> 13:38.973
Yeah? Why?

13:39.060 --> 13:41.858
Got a text saying you'd
been stabbed and were in A&E.

13:41.940 --> 13:45.535
That's that evil wanker who took my phone,
and my money, and my Hoover!

13:45.620 --> 13:47.736
- Nasty!
- And why aren't you looking for work?

13:47.820 --> 13:49.139
I've tried!

13:49.220 --> 13:52.610
No-one wants an unqualified
pregnant woman of my advanced years!

13:52.700 --> 13:56.693
Sexism, ageism, womb-ism.
Give us a whisky and a tomato juice.

13:56.780 --> 13:59.772
It's what my body wants.

13:59.860 --> 14:01.088
Where you off?

14:01.180 --> 14:02.295
Dry cleaners.

14:02.380 --> 14:03.654
You gonna cash up?

14:03.740 --> 14:05.856
Do it all in one go tonight.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.811
I'll get Vic. You leg it.

14:08.900 --> 14:10.299
Yeah, OK.

14:36.020 --> 14:37.373
So, yeah...

14:38.860 --> 14:40.816
Cheers. See ya tonight.

14:40.900 --> 14:42.458
See ya.

14:44.860 --> 14:46.771
(Fuck!)

14:46.860 --> 14:48.213
I've put in for firearms.

14:48.300 --> 14:50.689
I'm on shifts at the airport
with machine guns.

14:50.780 --> 14:54.614
Why? All those civilians, surely
a machine gun's the last thing you need?

14:54.700 --> 14:56.179
They look really cool!

14:56.260 --> 14:59.297
Sergeant! I've been looking for you.

14:59.380 --> 15:03.089
- Ma'am.
- Mm, ma'am! I like that!

15:03.180 --> 15:07.139
Next week, Los Angeles.
Fact-finding mission. Gang scum.

15:07.220 --> 15:10.018
"Popping caps in your ass!" and so on.

15:10.100 --> 15:14.298
- Wanna come? With me?
- I'd love to, but I don't have a passport, ma'am.

15:14.380 --> 15:15.654
I'll go!

15:15.740 --> 15:18.812
I don't think so!

15:18.900 --> 15:21.653
I'm disappointed.

15:21.740 --> 15:22.934
Very.

15:24.540 --> 15:25.893
She thinks I made that up!

15:25.980 --> 15:27.299
Well, you did!

15:27.380 --> 15:29.974
- I didn't! I ain't got a passport.
- Yes, you have!

15:30.060 --> 15:32.051
Shut up, Tom! Who's the sergeant?

15:32.140 --> 15:33.937
Don't see why she wouldn't take me!

15:34.020 --> 15:37.057
Your lack of vagina!
How do you think she became sergeant?

15:37.140 --> 15:38.289
You and me are gonna fall out!

15:39.900 --> 15:41.174
I thought we already had!

16:15.020 --> 16:15.975
Please!

16:24.220 --> 16:25.858
What?

16:38.300 --> 16:40.336
Ah. You were here two hours ago, love.

16:40.420 --> 16:42.172
I still don't want one.

16:50.180 --> 16:53.377
Admit it, Vic!
You stole money out the fuckin' till!

16:53.460 --> 16:55.416
I didn't! I fuckin' swear!

16:55.500 --> 16:56.933
I'm a workin' man, not a thief!

16:57.020 --> 16:59.170
- What's goin' on?
- This one's had his hand in the till.

16:59.260 --> 17:02.775
It wasn't me! Typical boss class!

17:02.860 --> 17:04.373
Maybe it wasn't him.

17:04.460 --> 17:06.530
Don't you go all "workers united" on us!

17:06.619 --> 17:08.736
This is well out of order. Fuck you both!

17:08.819 --> 17:11.936
You're a pussy-whipped bastard,
and you're a fuckin' slag!

17:12.020 --> 17:13.419
Oh, yeah?!

17:20.500 --> 17:23.252
Christ's sake. You <i>cannot</i> get the staff.

17:27.260 --> 17:29.330
So why did you fall out again?

17:29.420 --> 17:31.650
Don't want to talk about it.

17:31.740 --> 17:34.300
- It's cos Uncle Noel's gay.
- Who told you?

17:35.700 --> 17:37.850
(Paddy) That's not... Shut it!

17:37.940 --> 17:40.977
- We all know!
- Don't talk about it!

17:41.060 --> 17:45.372
It's bad enough having a pillow-biter
in the family without... voicing it.

17:47.620 --> 17:49.372
So you're identical twins?

17:52.300 --> 17:53.528
Oh...

17:56.500 --> 17:58.536
What do you mean by "Oh"?

17:58.620 --> 18:01.009
I dunno, it's just "identical"

18:01.100 --> 18:03.136
means "exactly the same"...

18:03.220 --> 18:07.736
If you so much as fuckin' hint that
I'm some bum-burgling no-mark again

18:07.820 --> 18:12.974
and I'll rip your fuckin' entrails out!
Do you understand me?!

18:13.060 --> 18:16.018
Do ya?

18:16.100 --> 18:18.853
There's only one pervert in this family!

18:18.940 --> 18:21.773
What do you say?

18:21.860 --> 18:24.249
Hello, Uncle Noel!

18:26.980 --> 18:29.892
Plus ca change,
plus c'est la meme chose!

18:29.980 --> 18:31.971
Bonjour, Patrick!

18:36.860 --> 18:40.614
I'm not sticking up for him.
I'm just saying there's other possibilities!

18:40.700 --> 18:44.579
Do you want your shifts back or
should we go and find someone else?

18:44.660 --> 18:47.538
Yeah. I'll have 'em. Cheers.

18:52.740 --> 18:54.890
He's never forgiven me
for being the oldest.

18:54.980 --> 18:58.131
I am the oldest! I was in the birth canal
when you came out of the C-section.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.415
That's the real race!

19:00.500 --> 19:03.731
I breathed air first! Ergo oldest.

19:03.820 --> 19:06.493
It's the oldest argument, too. I've missed it!

19:06.580 --> 19:07.933
I haven't.

19:08.020 --> 19:09.851
And I was Mammy's favourite.

19:09.940 --> 19:14.013
She liked going shopping with you.
That doesn't make you favourite.

19:14.100 --> 19:18.298
Who wouldn't prefer shopping to waiting
in police stations? I was a good boy.

19:18.380 --> 19:22.259
What's so good about gay pride, huh?
What a laugh! What's to be proud of?

19:22.340 --> 19:23.693
Clearly nothing for you.

19:23.780 --> 19:25.930
And for that I'm out of your life?

19:26.020 --> 19:29.217
- And I miss your family growing up?
- (Mimi) Stop it! There's no time for this.

19:29.300 --> 19:33.851
Paddy's in a hole,
looking at 20 years inside!

19:33.940 --> 19:36.534
What do you want me to do?

19:36.620 --> 19:39.692
We wanna confuse the police
with this identical twin thing,

19:39.780 --> 19:44.934
restage the robbery on the chemist
with one of you in custody as Paddy.

19:45.020 --> 19:47.409
Crime? Mercy!

19:47.500 --> 19:53.097
Exactly the same job, but with
Paddy inside he'll have a definite alibi!

19:53.180 --> 19:56.217
Means it might not have
been him the first time,

19:56.300 --> 19:59.849
creates a reasonable doubt!
They'll never get a conviction.

19:59.940 --> 20:01.168
What about me?

20:01.260 --> 20:04.775
They'll be seeking a lookie-likie.
Why not try twinnie? I would!

20:04.860 --> 20:07.420
Cos nobody knows shit about you.
I made sure of that.

20:07.500 --> 20:08.455
And what if I get caught?

20:08.540 --> 20:10.371
Think of all the men desperate for sex!

20:11.340 --> 20:15.049
There are easier ways than...

20:15.140 --> 20:18.849
Why do I bother?
Why would I risk that for you?

20:18.940 --> 20:21.010
You despise me! >

20:21.100 --> 20:22.613
Family.

20:23.340 --> 20:25.774
We'll do everything to keep
you out the frame.

20:25.860 --> 20:28.693
It's a risk.

20:28.780 --> 20:30.213
Scared, gay boy?

20:32.980 --> 20:35.778
Not as scared as you this time.

20:38.500 --> 20:42.618
Oh, Patrick...
We were as close as could be.

20:42.700 --> 20:45.294
You're still an angry thug.

20:45.380 --> 20:47.689
I won't do it.

20:49.700 --> 20:52.817
Nice one, prisoner 5645!

20:52.900 --> 20:55.539
What's your fall-back plan, Houdini?

20:59.980 --> 21:02.414
Mickey!

21:02.500 --> 21:05.060
Uncle Noel - go fetch him back.

21:05.140 --> 21:06.255
Why me?

21:06.340 --> 21:08.615
- You're the nearest thing we've got to a pansy!
- Piss off!

21:08.700 --> 21:10.372
Don't come back without him! >

21:15.860 --> 21:17.418
Y'all right?

21:17.500 --> 21:18.933
See ya later, Terry.

22:13.340 --> 22:16.093
VIBRATOR WHIRRS

22:37.620 --> 22:40.532
COCK CROWS

22:40.620 --> 22:42.815
Roast dinner-dodging bastard!

22:42.900 --> 22:45.539
Jesus. What's the time?

22:45.620 --> 22:48.692
COCK CROWS

22:48.780 --> 22:50.133
What's that smell?

22:53.340 --> 22:54.739
- Fuck!
- Shit!

23:07.060 --> 23:08.732
Goblin Teasmade.

23:19.700 --> 23:22.453
Surprisingly comfortable,
your fanny magnet.

23:24.380 --> 23:26.848
I'm not outing anyone.

23:28.460 --> 23:29.893
I know what he's like.

23:33.100 --> 23:34.499
When did you last see him?

23:36.300 --> 23:40.054
Ooh, when he said,
"Stay away from me, ya dirty poof!"

23:43.500 --> 23:45.377
Can't have been all his fault.

23:47.820 --> 23:50.971
He thought we were completely
honest with each other.

23:52.660 --> 23:54.173
Caught me in flagrante.

23:54.260 --> 23:55.249
Is that a nightclub?

23:55.340 --> 23:58.059
- In the act.
- I know what it means!

23:59.940 --> 24:01.293
Kicked my head in.

24:02.500 --> 24:04.456
Felt betrayed.

24:04.540 --> 24:06.258
Couldn't trust me.

24:07.860 --> 24:09.373
Irrevocable breakdown.

24:10.860 --> 24:14.375
And then you fucked off to uni
and started wankin' on like a student?

24:15.820 --> 24:17.014
Indubitably!

24:20.260 --> 24:23.172
We'd stopped getting along
before he knew.

24:23.260 --> 24:26.252
He used it as an excuse
to formalise the break.

24:27.860 --> 24:29.339
He betrayed <i>me.</i>

24:29.420 --> 24:31.615
He did.

24:31.700 --> 24:32.974
And he knows it.

24:33.060 --> 24:35.096
Why d'you think he's so guilty?

24:39.260 --> 24:42.013
I know he's a bastard...

24:42.100 --> 24:43.738
but I still don't want him to go down.

24:45.620 --> 24:48.453
Please, Uncle Noel.

25:01.420 --> 25:04.696
Could've been worse.
We could look like this.

25:05.860 --> 25:09.648
What the fuck?!
Are you all right? What happened?

25:09.740 --> 25:14.450
Torched. That prat Victor!
I'm gonna rip his spleen out!

25:14.540 --> 25:16.019
Jesus, I thought...

25:17.100 --> 25:18.294
I'm so sorry.

25:18.380 --> 25:20.530
It's hardly your fault, mate.

25:20.620 --> 25:22.099
It is.

25:25.460 --> 25:27.257
I should've been nicer to him.

25:27.340 --> 25:30.013
I felt sorry for him. Lost his last job.

25:30.100 --> 25:32.136
What?

25:32.220 --> 25:34.609
He lost his last one when the pub...

25:36.100 --> 25:37.897
...burnt down.

25:37.980 --> 25:39.891
Christ's sake, Jamie!

25:39.980 --> 25:43.734
We'd be baked if it
weren't for that bird!

25:43.820 --> 25:45.492
Lillian's rooster?

25:45.580 --> 25:47.218
Woke us up cock-a-doodling.

25:47.300 --> 25:49.609
Bloody Fire Brigade! Why couldn't
they watch where they were going?

25:49.700 --> 25:51.850
I'II... take it to Lillian's.

25:53.820 --> 25:55.811
Might have to lay you off for a bit, mate.

26:08.940 --> 26:10.339
Well, you could try.

26:15.540 --> 26:16.973
What's up?

26:21.140 --> 26:24.496
Done something really stupid.

26:24.580 --> 26:26.138
Well, can you fix it?

26:27.820 --> 26:29.617
Don't you want to know what it is?

26:32.580 --> 26:34.172
Don't know if I can.

26:35.780 --> 26:40.456
I mean, I could shut up about it
and no-one would know the difference.

26:42.220 --> 26:45.656
I've been a total twat to mates.

26:45.740 --> 26:48.379
And what good would telling the truth do?

26:49.980 --> 26:51.538
It might make me feel better.

26:53.300 --> 26:57.088
Just keep it shut,
cope with the guilt on your own.

26:57.180 --> 26:58.613
That's the punishment.

27:05.020 --> 27:06.373
Fuckin' hell.

27:06.460 --> 27:08.928
COMPUTER GAME BLARES

27:11.380 --> 27:13.211
What are you doing? You had me.

27:13.300 --> 27:16.610
I can't be arsed. I only play it for you.

27:17.620 --> 27:19.975
- Have you found Noel?
- In t'car, waiting for yous.

27:20.060 --> 27:22.813
We've been camping out all night.

27:40.500 --> 27:43.253
I see you're gonna make me pay
for all the years of hurt.

27:43.340 --> 27:44.534
Who wants the favour?

27:44.620 --> 27:48.329
Am I gonna have to bend over
backwards or forwards?

27:51.260 --> 27:52.295
Sorry.

27:53.740 --> 27:55.173
Sorry.

28:03.940 --> 28:06.932
Why does it matter to you
what I do with my cock?

28:08.540 --> 28:12.579
We...

28:12.660 --> 28:13.934
wanked together.

28:14.020 --> 28:16.011
You're not gay, Pat.

28:16.100 --> 28:19.217
I would have died for you
and you were lying. You lied!

28:19.300 --> 28:20.892
You loved me being gay.

28:20.980 --> 28:23.369
It meant you could break away,

28:23.460 --> 28:25.928
be on your own, not part of a pair.

28:26.020 --> 28:28.454
And then you end up with a wife,

28:28.540 --> 28:29.893
who's as close as a twin.

28:29.980 --> 28:33.893
Is that irony? I can never remember.
I'll have to look it up.

28:36.220 --> 28:37.938
I'll let you in on a little secret.

28:39.380 --> 28:40.733
I wasn't her favourite.

28:42.100 --> 28:43.533
She just hated me less.

28:48.300 --> 28:50.860
Jesus, I'd forgotten how much
of a bleedin' know-all you are.

28:51.940 --> 28:53.976
Are you gonna help me?

28:56.140 --> 28:57.573
I might.

28:59.540 --> 29:03.772
And what fucking silly-arsed hoops
are you gonna make me leap through first?

29:11.700 --> 29:13.850
Noel has very kindly agreed to help.

29:13.940 --> 29:15.612
About fuckin' time.

29:15.700 --> 29:19.739
In return, I'd like yous all to make space
in your diary for Noel's nuptials.

29:19.820 --> 29:23.176
- You what?
- Noel's marrying...

29:23.260 --> 29:24.978
Lionel.

29:25.060 --> 29:28.735
I'm giving him away
and paying for it.

29:28.820 --> 29:30.617
I'm really happy for you, Noel.

29:30.700 --> 29:31.894
Thanks.

29:33.860 --> 29:34.815
Nice one.

29:36.620 --> 29:39.009
What you talking about?
It's two fuckin' blokes.

29:39.100 --> 29:43.332
Shut it! If he's keeping me out of prison,
he can marry a fucking horse!

29:43.420 --> 29:46.617
Not that I'd ever... ever compare Leonard...

29:46.700 --> 29:49.453
- Lionel.
...Lionel to a horse.

29:49.540 --> 29:51.132
Thanks, Pat.

29:53.300 --> 29:54.733
We need a dress rehearsal.

29:57.780 --> 29:59.930
Why do I have to be the chemist?

30:00.020 --> 30:04.775
- This is a robbery, motherfucker!
- Shane, language.

30:04.860 --> 30:06.373
But that's what I said last time.

30:06.460 --> 30:08.416
I'm sorry. I thought we were
doing this exactly the same.

30:08.500 --> 30:09.694
We are.

30:12.020 --> 30:14.375
Open the back
or I'll chop your fuckin' hand off.

30:14.460 --> 30:16.337
No, I... I can't do this.

30:16.420 --> 30:18.138
It's...

30:18.220 --> 30:20.097
so violent.

30:20.180 --> 30:21.738
I mean, it's just not me.

30:21.820 --> 30:24.015
Christ on a... bike!

30:24.100 --> 30:29.299
When you asked me to do this and I
very kindly and perhaps foolishly agreed,

30:29.380 --> 30:35.819
I assumed it was going to be me in prison
for the evening, pretending to be you.

30:35.900 --> 30:37.094
Hm?

30:37.180 --> 30:41.651
Now, there's doing you a favour
and there's total stupidity.

30:42.740 --> 30:44.571
There's only so much I can do.

30:50.220 --> 30:51.175
OK, fine.

30:51.260 --> 30:53.569
Your way.

30:53.660 --> 30:56.572
I do the robbery, I take all the risk.

30:58.260 --> 30:59.329
Seems fair.

31:04.340 --> 31:05.978
See you, Yvonne.

31:07.860 --> 31:11.648
Just had a whisper from a snout.
New dealer we're after? Small, 'bout ten.

31:11.740 --> 31:15.176
- White, roundish face, brown hair?
- Like him?

31:16.700 --> 31:18.577
Or... him?

31:23.140 --> 31:25.096
No, like 'im.

31:25.180 --> 31:26.898
Oi! Gallagher!

31:29.100 --> 31:31.056
- Come here, you.
- Get off me.

31:35.580 --> 31:36.535
What's this?

31:36.620 --> 31:38.690
- Where d'you get that?
- Selling fairy cakes.

31:38.780 --> 31:41.055
- Sounds a bit far-fetched.
- It's true.

31:41.140 --> 31:47.090
Look, go home, and if you're up to
bad stuff, stop now. D'you hear me?

31:47.180 --> 31:48.533
No chance. He's nicked.

31:48.620 --> 31:51.692
- What? He let me go!
- Ain't gonna happen. Fairy cakes?

31:51.780 --> 31:54.169
- He'll crack under questioning.
- Look, we're letting him go.

31:54.260 --> 31:56.933
- It is quite a lot.
- Get off. You've just blown it.

31:57.020 --> 31:58.851
Last chance. You're finished.

31:58.940 --> 32:00.692
Let him go, <i>Wendy!</i>

32:03.220 --> 32:04.335
Wendy?

32:04.420 --> 32:07.014
Who's Wendy?

32:08.540 --> 32:09.814
Scarper.

32:09.900 --> 32:12.016
Oi!

32:22.300 --> 32:24.530
We've both done wrong.

32:24.620 --> 32:27.259
Not obeying insane sergeant, wrist slap.

32:27.340 --> 32:29.649
Assuming false identity to get job in police,

32:29.740 --> 32:31.731
- five years.
- So I said I was my sister.

32:31.820 --> 32:35.290
- Big balaumba!
- Yes, it is. Why?

32:36.380 --> 32:38.177
Failed the psychological tests.

32:38.260 --> 32:41.730
Not suitable. Joke. That ink spot
did look like Myra Hindley.

32:41.820 --> 32:45.096
- I'm a born copper.
- Where's your sister?

32:45.180 --> 32:46.408
Dead.

32:49.020 --> 32:52.137
Did you... kill her?

32:52.220 --> 32:56.691
She died in a plane crash in Africa.

32:56.780 --> 33:00.489
There was some confusion
over the death certificate,

33:00.580 --> 33:02.457
so I gave myself another shot.

33:02.540 --> 33:03.893
How did you pass the test?

33:03.980 --> 33:05.572
I learned all the answers.

33:08.300 --> 33:13.249
Look, I'm a sergeant. Everything's good,
I'm good. Please, Tom.

33:13.340 --> 33:14.898
I live for this job. You know I do.

33:14.980 --> 33:17.175
- I'm nothing without it.
- I dunno.

33:17.260 --> 33:20.411
I'll do anything to stay on the force,
anything, please.

33:20.500 --> 33:22.855
D'you wanna have sex with me?

33:22.940 --> 33:25.579
No. Yes... No!

33:25.660 --> 33:28.379
Go on. Any position, any kink.

33:28.460 --> 33:29.688
Stop it!

33:29.780 --> 33:31.498
I don't want sex with you.

33:31.580 --> 33:35.459
You're all sorts of strange, bad things.

33:35.540 --> 33:38.612
Don't do it to me.

33:38.700 --> 33:39.894
Please.

33:44.300 --> 33:45.938
I'm beggin'.

33:52.300 --> 33:56.498
I can't see you thrown out of the force.
I won't say anything.

34:02.940 --> 34:04.612
(Yes!)

34:12.340 --> 34:15.013
Ah, another hand for the deck.

34:15.100 --> 34:16.373
Be like new in no time.

34:18.260 --> 34:20.933
That Victor,
he's working at The Feathers.

34:21.020 --> 34:23.853
You haven't done anything yet?

34:23.940 --> 34:27.250
- Thought we'd leave him a bit.
- They're the competition.

34:27.340 --> 34:30.775
A fire there wouldn't be bad news.

34:34.940 --> 34:36.612
It was me who took the money.

34:39.260 --> 34:40.215
I'm sorry.

34:40.300 --> 34:43.018
I thought I could borrow it and get it back.

34:43.100 --> 34:45.250
I wasn't gonna nick it.

34:45.340 --> 34:48.092
I'm really, really, fuckin' sorry.

34:48.179 --> 34:53.379
I'll pay you back. I'll redecorate.
I shouldn't have done it. I'm sorry.

34:53.460 --> 34:55.257
You were family.

34:55.340 --> 34:56.898
I'm sorry.

34:56.980 --> 34:58.936
Keys.

35:02.140 --> 35:04.973
Now piss off.

35:21.780 --> 35:24.055
Right, let's take stock.

35:24.140 --> 35:27.052
Now, then, I've run up
against society's prejudice,

35:27.140 --> 35:28.812
so I've earned nothing.

35:28.900 --> 35:31.016
£22.73.

35:31.100 --> 35:32.294
200.

35:32.380 --> 35:34.291
Minus 350.

35:37.660 --> 35:41.050
Me and Liam did it together.

35:41.140 --> 35:42.619
You have won...

35:42.700 --> 35:47.091
£3,850.

35:47.180 --> 35:49.011
Where the fuck?!

35:49.100 --> 35:50.658
Fairy cakes.

35:50.740 --> 35:51.934
With hash in.

35:53.020 --> 35:54.135
You're drug dealers?

35:54.220 --> 35:55.892
You can use the leftover cash

35:55.980 --> 35:58.494
- and pay back what you owe.
- Where did you get the drugs?

35:58.580 --> 36:00.252
You want 'em wholesale?

36:00.340 --> 36:02.456
Why not? You can't sell any.

36:03.780 --> 36:07.216
OK, on a very temporary basis.

36:07.300 --> 36:08.813
It's only dope.

36:08.900 --> 36:10.049
Drugs caused it.

36:10.140 --> 36:11.459
Dad caused it.

36:11.540 --> 36:13.258
Is he still in your room?

36:13.340 --> 36:16.696
No, Mummy, I don't wanna join the Navy.

36:16.780 --> 36:20.216
Oooh, shoe. Oh, shoe...

36:20.300 --> 36:22.734
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Cos you would have stopped us.

36:22.820 --> 36:25.732
- Too fucking right I would!
- Well, look, there's some left.

36:25.820 --> 36:28.732
I'm jobless and friendless cos of...

36:30.180 --> 36:32.375
Right, I'm gonna sort this out with Paddy.

36:35.820 --> 36:38.653
Liam, what you doin'?

36:38.740 --> 36:41.777
I can't... Debbie can't deal
drugs for you any more.

36:41.860 --> 36:43.054
I'm stopping anyway.

36:43.140 --> 36:46.815
Mimi, what's going on?
This little girl deals drugs for us?

36:46.900 --> 36:48.697
Three grand paid.

36:48.780 --> 36:51.135
I'm sorry, but we're not
doing any more dealing.

36:51.220 --> 36:54.815
No, temporary.
I should have told you, Paddy.

36:54.900 --> 36:56.379
Mimo.

36:58.300 --> 37:02.930
You must always share with me.
I would have put a stop to it.

37:03.020 --> 37:06.296
Back to school, young lady.

37:07.420 --> 37:08.853
Go on.

37:11.540 --> 37:13.371
And you...

37:16.100 --> 37:18.853
Thank you very much
for bringing it to my attention.

37:31.180 --> 37:34.058
Jesus.

37:34.140 --> 37:37.689
You know, maybe yous all
deserve to be in prison.

37:37.780 --> 37:40.453
Don't have second thoughts. Don't.

37:40.540 --> 37:42.212
Please.

37:45.540 --> 37:47.417
Good luck, Noel.

37:49.660 --> 37:51.457
Good luck, Pat.

37:59.660 --> 38:00.854
You!

38:00.940 --> 38:02.976
Yes, you!

38:03.060 --> 38:06.097
You are a big, bald...

38:06.180 --> 38:08.774
bumhole, that's what you are!

38:08.860 --> 38:11.658
- Had a couple too many, eh?
- So what if I have?

38:11.740 --> 38:13.571
What are you gonna do about it?

38:13.660 --> 38:15.412
Hmm? Hmm?

38:15.500 --> 38:17.297
I've got a few too many!

38:18.700 --> 38:20.531
Oh, Paddy, come on!

38:23.900 --> 38:26.130
Aye, all right.
What are you doing with me?

38:27.780 --> 38:28.929
What's he in for?

38:29.020 --> 38:31.056
D and D.

38:31.140 --> 38:33.700
Did you have any intention ever
of keeping your side of the bargain?

38:33.780 --> 38:37.898
- Of course.
- Cos I'm not seeing muff here, am I?

38:37.980 --> 38:42.929
I can imagine a scenario
where your career stutters at sergeant.

38:46.340 --> 38:48.535
- This is a fucking robbery, motherfucker!
- Oh, not again!

38:48.620 --> 38:50.975
- One false move and you're an arm down!
- OK...

38:51.060 --> 38:53.654
He's all bluster. I'm the real deal.
One word,

38:53.740 --> 38:55.935
and your balls are in the post to your wife.

38:58.380 --> 39:01.213
Please take whatever you want.
Don't hurt me, please.

39:15.260 --> 39:16.978
It's everything I could get.

39:18.100 --> 39:21.137
For the decorating and the...
and the money I borrowed.

39:21.220 --> 39:22.369
Nicked.

39:22.460 --> 39:24.291
I can't believe I did that.

39:24.380 --> 39:26.894
I was so sure you'd lend it us.

39:26.980 --> 39:29.255
I was hurt when you didn't,
taking the cash...

39:29.340 --> 39:31.137
- It was your "fuck you"?
- No.

39:33.380 --> 39:35.211
I just nicked it.

39:35.300 --> 39:38.656
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. We're mates.

39:38.740 --> 39:40.492
Turn the fuckin' taps off.

39:43.860 --> 39:46.420
We'll keep this, so just go.

39:49.060 --> 39:52.370
Thought you'd know something
about second chances.

39:52.460 --> 39:53.609
You got one.

39:57.740 --> 39:59.173
Got you that.

40:05.340 --> 40:06.773
What?

40:18.540 --> 40:20.019
(Paddy) 'Where is he? '

40:21.660 --> 40:23.651
Why haven't we heard anything?

40:23.740 --> 40:26.174
What if the cameras weren't working?

40:26.260 --> 40:28.649
What if he didn't get arrested?

40:28.740 --> 40:31.208
All sorts of things could go wrong.

40:31.300 --> 40:33.370
Why hasn't Fat Todd called?

40:33.460 --> 40:38.170
Relax. We've got to assume
he knows what he's doin'.

40:38.260 --> 40:39.249
DOOR OPENS

40:40.940 --> 40:42.658
Thank fuck! Where have you been?

40:42.740 --> 40:44.617
In a cell.

40:44.700 --> 40:46.770
Until Fat Todd arrived.

40:46.860 --> 40:48.054
He's there now.

40:57.020 --> 40:59.853
Is it true? About the CCTV?

40:59.940 --> 41:02.295
Yep. There goes the tape with the lawyer.

41:02.380 --> 41:04.814
Apparently, Paddy Maguire's
superhuman. Win some...

41:04.900 --> 41:07.414
We can't let him get away with it!
It's a scam.

41:07.500 --> 41:10.378
Probably, but I've had a word.
No-one's interested.

41:10.460 --> 41:11.973
But they've got to be. He's...

41:12.060 --> 41:15.018
He's a villain. He's a major face.

41:15.100 --> 41:17.739
We need to nick him.
He belongs inside.

41:17.820 --> 41:20.380
Do you always
go all Sweeney when you're angry?

41:21.620 --> 41:23.736
Ask them again. Please.

41:23.820 --> 41:27.608
- And look a right twat? No, I won't.
- Ask them and I'll have sex with you.

41:29.620 --> 41:32.418
No. Too late.

41:32.500 --> 41:36.334
WPC Flannery. Now,
there's a woman with ambition.

41:39.940 --> 41:42.408
They're dropping all charges.

41:42.500 --> 41:45.219
How do you do that?

41:45.300 --> 41:49.134
You on CCTV and in the cell?

41:51.140 --> 41:53.608
CID knows something's gone on,

41:53.700 --> 41:56.658
but you're just not big enough
for them to bother putting the work in.

41:56.740 --> 41:59.379
That cuts me to the very core.

42:00.500 --> 42:03.378
I'm deeply wounded.

42:03.460 --> 42:05.416
What's the matter?

42:05.500 --> 42:07.013
You don't look too pleased for me.

42:07.100 --> 42:08.852
I don't wanna work for you.

42:08.940 --> 42:11.898
But you do. Tough titty.

42:11.980 --> 42:13.174
What if we had sex?

42:14.340 --> 42:16.808
Would that be quits?

42:16.900 --> 42:18.811
Christ, no!

42:18.900 --> 42:22.131
Only need one look to know
you're a crap shag.

42:22.220 --> 42:26.259
You're mine
in a much better way than that.

42:37.900 --> 42:38.855
What?

42:40.380 --> 42:42.018
What?

42:51.500 --> 42:53.172
You're a fucking twat, lan.

42:53.260 --> 42:55.091
Yeah.

42:55.180 --> 42:56.977
But you're our fuckin' twat.

42:59.900 --> 43:01.253
Will you come back?

43:03.220 --> 43:06.178
You sure? You really want me?

43:06.260 --> 43:08.330
No.

43:08.420 --> 43:13.016
We want somebody trustworthy.
But you'll have to do.

43:13.100 --> 43:15.739
We're not redecoratin'.
We're going on holiday.

43:15.820 --> 43:16.775
With your money.

43:17.780 --> 43:19.930
- Ibiza.
- And we're going now.

43:20.020 --> 43:21.419
(Jamie) You're late.

43:23.500 --> 43:24.933
Right!

43:31.020 --> 43:32.499
lan!

43:32.580 --> 43:35.890
Bottles of your best, burnt champagne.

43:35.980 --> 43:37.572
LAUGHS

43:37.660 --> 43:41.096
- I love it when a plan comes together!
- Nice one, Dad!

43:42.100 --> 43:45.217
I can't stay, Pad. You don't
have to come to our wedding.

43:45.300 --> 43:46.255
What?!

43:46.340 --> 43:48.456
And I don't want you to
pay for it or give me away.

43:49.540 --> 43:50.655
