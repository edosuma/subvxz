08:45.259 --> 08:47.459
       - Um... well, I...

08:47.494 --> 08:49.861
I should've talked to you
about that earlier.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.897
          - About what?
            - Well...

08:51.932 --> 08:55.200
people just aren't
volunteering anymore.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.836
      - But it's Christmas.
       - Unfortunately...

08:57.871 --> 09:00.805
Christmas isn't
what it was here anymore.

09:00.841 --> 09:03.708
       - What do you mean?
     - Well, it all started

09:03.744 --> 09:06.077
a few years ago
when the paper mill closed down.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.413
That mill was a big part
of this town.

09:08.448 --> 09:11.816
And all of a sudden, people were
looking for jobs elsewhere.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.785
        - Where did they all go?

09:13.820 --> 09:15.787
- Well, a lot of them
pulled up stakes

09:15.822 --> 09:17.722
          and moved on.
              - Oh.

09:17.758 --> 09:20.759
        So what about the people
            who still live here?

09:20.794 --> 09:23.461
- Well, most of them
found jobs in other towns.

09:23.530 --> 09:25.297
But that means a longer commute,

09:25.332 --> 09:27.799
which means less time
with friends and neighbours.

09:27.834 --> 09:30.468
  - And less time for tradition

09:30.504 --> 09:32.437
         and community.
            - Mm-hmm.

09:32.472 --> 09:34.706
You feel it more

09:34.741 --> 09:36.808
when Christmas comes around.

09:36.843 --> 09:38.476

09:38.512 --> 09:41.179
We've lost
something important.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.882
                     - Hi!

09:43.917 --> 09:46.217
- Hey, Pastor Howard.
We're ready.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.186
     - Just a second, dear.

09:48.221 --> 09:49.955
        I'm just worried

09:50.023 --> 09:51.890
    that we won't find a way
         to get it back.

09:51.925 --> 09:55.060

         need to get busy, then.

        everywhere I go.

11:53.847 --> 11:55.747
I've had it for like,
100 years. It was a gift

11:55.816 --> 11:57.615
from a friend.
It helps me remember.

11:57.684 --> 12:01.019
        - Remember what?
    - Well, see how the light

        a Christmas angel, then.

extra Christmas spirit.

     - That's right, honey.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.928

can get a really big one

15:29.963 --> 15:31.629
this year since they

15:31.665 --> 15:34.132
cancelled the Christmas pageant.
    - The Christmas pageant?

15:34.167 --> 15:36.034
   - Angel Falls has sponsored
 a children's Christmas pageant

15:36.069 --> 15:37.869
  for years, and this would've
 been the first year that Jenny

15:37.904 --> 15:40.071
   was old enough to be in the
  show, but they cancelled it.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.507
                 - Oh! Well, why
             would they do that?

15:42.575 --> 15:44.909
    - Oh, you'll have to ask
      the mayor about that.

15:44.945 --> 15:47.378
          - The mayor?
    - Uh, Joe Crosby, he runs

15:47.414 --> 15:50.548
the toy store across the street.
  Enjoy your cider. Excuse me.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.784

    in the Christmas pageant?

15:52.852 --> 15:54.752

       - Don't give up on

15:54.821 --> 15:56.754
          that Christmas pageant
                        yet, OK?

15:56.790 --> 15:59.424
 - Can I have some cookies, mom?

15:59.459 --> 16:01.726
- Mommy's on the phone, sweetie.
        Yes, absolutely.

16:01.761 --> 16:04.462

16:07.367 --> 16:10.168
- Believe me,
the last thing on earth

16:10.236 --> 16:12.170
I wanted to do was to cancel
the Christmas pageant.

16:12.205 --> 16:14.272
         - But you're the mayor.
                    Couldn't you

16:14.307 --> 16:16.374
     do something about it?
      - Tell me something.

16:16.409 --> 16:19.043
Why are you so interested
in the town pageant?

16:19.079 --> 16:22.380
     - I... am really interested
                in learning more

16:22.449 --> 16:24.549
about what people in Angel Falls
       like to do for Christmas.

16:24.617 --> 16:26.517
        It'll give me some ideas
                 for the church.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.553
- Well, you can't hold a pageant

16:28.588 --> 16:30.355
 without some place to put it on

16:30.390 --> 16:32.390
and since the community centre
closed last year,

16:32.425 --> 16:34.559
we haven't had much choice.

16:34.627 --> 16:37.095
             - Why did you close
           the community centre?

16:37.163 --> 16:39.163
- I'll tell you what.

16:39.232 --> 16:40.798
 The centre's around the corner.

16:40.867 --> 16:43.868
Take a look for yourself.
That might answer your question.

16:43.903 --> 16:46.304
           - Do you think people
          will miss the pageant?

16:46.373 --> 16:48.973
- I guess for the past
few years, the pageant hasn't

16:49.009 --> 16:51.976
been quite what it used to be.
And with people moving away

16:52.012 --> 16:55.046
or getting jobs out of town,
folks just kind of...

16:55.115 --> 16:58.416
lost their enthusiasm.
And when the centre closed down,

16:58.451 --> 17:01.719

it was time to let it go.

 it was like when the whole town

17:48.468 --> 17:50.168
   - Yeah, hey! I was just...

17:50.236 --> 17:52.670
        just driving by,
     and I... saw you here.

17:52.705 --> 17:54.639
    You lookin' for someone?
         - No! I just...

17:54.707 --> 17:56.441
  I heard the community centre
           was closed

17:56.509 --> 17:58.276
     and I was curious why.

17:58.344 --> 18:00.244
             - Well, it's an old
             building, you know?

18:00.313 --> 18:03.014
  It just needs a lot of work.
   - But what about Christmas?

18:03.083 --> 18:05.216
         - Last I heard,
       it's still coming.

18:05.251 --> 18:08.186
- No, I mean for the town,
the pageant and the potluck.

18:08.221 --> 18:09.921
  - How do you know about that?

18:09.989 --> 18:11.889
- I kind of ask a lot
of questions. You'll get

18:11.925 --> 18:15.093
           used to it.
- Sounds like I'm gonna have to.

18:15.161 --> 18:17.428
- Did you spend
a lot of time in here?

18:17.464 --> 18:20.598
    - Yeah. As a matter of fact,
        I grew up in Angel Falls

18:20.633 --> 18:22.667
          so I got a lot of good
        Christmas memories here.

18:22.735 --> 18:25.069
- I bet you miss it.

18:25.105 --> 18:27.505
        - Yeah. You know,
        I should probably

18:27.540 --> 18:29.474
  get back to work. I got a lot
  of deliveries to make, so...

18:29.509 --> 18:31.876
                - Do you work at
             the hardware store?

18:31.945 --> 18:34.378
       - Yeah, I sure do.
  - Do you mind if I tag along?

18:34.414 --> 18:37.715
- What? You wanna ride along
with me while I make deliveries?

18:37.750 --> 18:40.118
 - Well, it might be a good way
 for me to get to see the town,

18:40.186 --> 18:43.154
 since you're from here and all.
   - Yeah! Come on, let's go.

18:44.991 --> 18:47.658
        Watch your step.
       - This'll be great!

18:52.732 --> 18:54.665
So what was it like,

18:54.701 --> 18:56.868
growing up in Angel Falls?

18:56.903 --> 18:59.337
             - What was it like?
             Um... I don't know.

18:59.372 --> 19:01.272
          It's probably the same
    as growing up anywhere else,

19:01.307 --> 19:03.441
          I guess. It's... home.
          It's where you belong.

19:03.476 --> 19:06.644
      - That must be nice.
        - What about you?

19:06.713 --> 19:09.280
      Where's home for you?
       - All over, really.

19:09.315 --> 19:13.050
I never settled down
in one place for very long.

19:13.119 --> 19:14.886
               - That's gotta be
          pretty tough on a kid,

19:14.921 --> 19:17.221
 especially around the holidays.

19:17.257 --> 19:19.423
     Maybe that explains why you
         love Christmas so much.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.592
- Maybe.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.561
  - Well, there you are, Jack!
        I was just about

19:23.630 --> 19:25.296
to call out a search party.

19:25.331 --> 19:27.498
             - I had a few stops
          to make along the way.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.967
- I don't know how you do it.

19:30.003 --> 19:33.171
    - Dolores, this is Gabby.
        - Hi, I'm Gabby.

19:33.239 --> 19:35.506
           - Hi there.
    - This is Dolores' place.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.475
        - It's beautiful.
    - Gabby's helping us out

19:37.510 --> 19:39.243
        at St. Andrew's, gettin'
            ready for Christmas.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.112
             - Yes!
              - Ah.

19:41.147 --> 19:43.347
Well, then you certainly have
your hands full, don't you?

19:43.416 --> 19:47.952
       - I guess so, yes.
      - Do you have my bone
       meal on your truck?

19:48.021 --> 19:49.954
       - Let me go get it.
             - Yeah!

19:50.023 --> 19:52.089
Nothing like a little bone meal
to perk up your plants.

19:52.125 --> 19:53.958
   You wanna come in and see?
       - I would love to.

19:53.993 --> 19:55.927
        - Come right in.
              - OK.

19:55.962 --> 19:58.963
          Oh, wow! Hi!
              - Hi.

19:58.998 --> 20:00.698
  - Working here must feel like

20:00.767 --> 20:02.800
     watching Christmas grow
  right in front of your eyes.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.169
 - That is exactly how it feels.

20:05.205 --> 20:07.605
         Hey, this one. For you.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.907
   - Oh, no! I... I couldn't.
       - You'll appreciate

20:09.976 --> 20:12.143
       having a little Christmas
                 growing nearby.

20:12.212 --> 20:14.512
        - Oh, thank you!
        - So there he is!

20:14.581 --> 20:16.681
    - Where do you want 'em?
         - Right there.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.849
          - All right.
         - Thanks, Jack.

20:20.353 --> 20:22.553
     - Well, thank you again
     for showing me around.

20:22.622 --> 20:25.823
 - I'm sorry it wasn't much help
   in finding a volunteer, but--

20:25.892 --> 20:27.858
- No, no! That's OK.
I have a couple ideas.

20:27.927 --> 20:30.528
          - All right!
     - All right. Bye, Jack.

20:30.563 --> 20:34.031
                - See you later.

20:34.067 --> 20:36.701
               Oh!

20:36.769 --> 20:38.536
                     Hey, Gabby!

20:38.605 --> 20:41.872
     You forgot your plant.
            - Oh, no!

20:41.908 --> 20:43.774
           Thank you.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.979
            - You're sure set on
         doing this, aren't you?

20:48.014 --> 20:50.248
- Pretty much.

20:50.316 --> 20:52.583
   - Well, if you need anything,
                you let me know.

20:52.619 --> 20:55.953
        - See you around.
             - Bye.

20:56.022 --> 20:59.323
      (gently gusting wind)
         - Very festive!

20:59.359 --> 21:02.126
         - It's an early
       Christmas present!

21:02.161 --> 21:03.961
- He seems like a nice guy.

21:03.997 --> 21:06.964
            - He is.
 - The kind of guy who gives you

21:07.000 --> 21:09.867
the feeling there's a lot more
going on than meets the eye.

21:09.902 --> 21:12.003

              just so different.

           what they're feeling.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.847

their Christmas spirit.

21:24.884 --> 21:26.784

21:26.853 --> 21:28.586
- So what's the plan?

21:28.655 --> 21:31.889
  - I have to find a way to show
      them what they're missing.

21:31.958 --> 21:34.292

26:14.173 --> 26:16.373
    You gonna scratch me too?
      - No, no. I promise.

26:16.409 --> 26:19.009
          - All right.
          - Can I help?

26:19.045 --> 26:21.345
         - Lead the way.
- OK. I was thinking right here,

26:21.380 --> 26:24.815
where you used to have
the church Christmas tree.

26:24.850 --> 26:27.618
You didn't tell me you
owned the hardware store.

26:27.687 --> 26:30.020
       - You asked me if I
    worked there, which I do.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.089
     My mom and dad picked it up
               when I was a kid,

26:32.158 --> 26:34.124
              and I took it over
    from them when they retired.

26:34.193 --> 26:35.893
         - And the girl
      working in the store?

26:35.962 --> 26:38.228
- Alice. Yeah, she's
the daughter of a good friend.

26:38.297 --> 26:41.298
I've known her
since she was a little baby.

26:41.367 --> 26:43.067
              - Oh.
 - Smart kid. She could probably

26:43.102 --> 26:46.003
 run that place without me, but
 things have been a little rocky

26:46.038 --> 26:48.238
 lately between her and her mom.
       - What do you mean?

26:48.307 --> 26:50.374
- Well, she lost her dad

26:50.409 --> 26:52.843
last year around the holidays,

26:52.878 --> 26:54.545
so she misses him a lot.

26:54.614 --> 26:57.448
- Oh, and with Christmas coming,
 she'll miss him that much more.

26:57.483 --> 27:00.884
 - Yeah. I just want her to know
     that I'm there for her,

27:00.920 --> 27:03.287
you know? If, um... sorry.

27:03.322 --> 27:05.522
If she... if she needs me.

27:05.558 --> 27:07.725
                - Well, I'm sure
            that's the best gift

27:07.793 --> 27:09.860
       you could give her.

27:12.865 --> 27:15.332
- I think that's the last box
of decorations.

27:15.368 --> 27:18.335
      - Ooh, it looks like a lot
            of these are broken.

27:18.371 --> 27:22.006
- Man, these lights
are pretty old school.

27:24.543 --> 27:26.477
           - Oh, wow.

27:26.545 --> 27:29.613
    Look at this! Angel Falls

27:29.649 --> 27:31.482
                 was so festive.

27:31.517 --> 27:33.717
             - Wow.
             - 1995.

27:33.786 --> 27:35.786
- Well, look at that.

27:35.821 --> 27:38.422
   That's the community centre
          right there.

27:38.491 --> 27:41.892
   - Is that what it looked like
       when you were growing up?

27:44.697 --> 27:46.296
- Yeah.

27:46.332 --> 27:49.900
I should probably, um,
get back to the store. I've been

27:49.935 --> 27:53.170
  gone for a really long time.
              - OK.

27:53.239 --> 27:55.472
- Yeah. OK.

27:57.576 --> 27:59.443
   - Thank you for your help!

27:59.478 --> 28:01.378
               - You're welcome.

28:41.053 --> 28:42.753
           Now, I have
      one last announcement

28:42.822 --> 28:46.290
               to make before we
             end today's sermon.

28:46.325 --> 28:48.692
    In this season of giving,

28:48.761 --> 28:51.595
it's important that we take time

28:51.630 --> 28:54.698
  to think about what we can do
     to help our community.

28:54.734 --> 28:57.601
           And with that thought
           in mind, I would like

28:57.670 --> 29:00.404
 to introduce our new Christmas

29:00.473 --> 29:02.773
     volunteer coordinator,
        Gabby Messenger.

29:02.808 --> 29:05.242
              - Hi!

29:05.277 --> 29:08.178
           (cheering)

29:09.582 --> 29:11.482
        Please, on your way out,

29:11.517 --> 29:13.484
  stop and say hello to Gabby.

29:13.519 --> 29:16.987
 We think she has some wonderful
 ideas on celebrating Christmas

29:17.022 --> 29:20.657
            here at St. Andrew's
      and in all of Angel Falls.

29:20.726 --> 29:23.861
   I will see you all next week.

29:23.896 --> 29:25.662
                      Thank you.

29:25.698 --> 29:28.031
              See you next week.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.000
     - Hello! We would love

29:30.069 --> 29:31.969
      to have you. Oh, OK.

29:32.004 --> 29:34.171
       Hi, I'm Gabby, and I'm...

29:34.240 --> 29:36.840
          working... with the...

29:36.876 --> 29:39.777
  Hello! Um... Merry Christmas!

29:39.812 --> 29:42.746
We would love to have you
work with us this...

29:42.815 --> 29:44.515
                  - Don't worry.

29:44.583 --> 29:47.251
           Christmas is the time
                   for miracles.

29:50.022 --> 29:52.222
       - Merry Christmas!
- (Pastor): So nice to meet you!

30:11.477 --> 30:13.677
        (bench creaking)

30:18.284 --> 30:20.350
      (gently gusting wind)

30:20.386 --> 30:22.319
          - I like it.

30:22.354 --> 30:23.987
        Very understated.

30:24.023 --> 30:27.691
 - It doesn't exactly say,
"All is merry and bright."

30:27.760 --> 30:30.194
       - But it's a start!
     - Michael, I'm supposed

30:30.262 --> 30:32.196
              to help the people
                  of Angel Falls

30:32.231 --> 30:34.164
            find their Christmas
            spirit again without

30:34.200 --> 30:37.201
getting too involved, of course.
          - Of course.

30:37.236 --> 30:40.971
   - I can't even find anyone to
   help me decorate the church.

30:41.006 --> 30:44.308
- So what do we do?

30:44.376 --> 30:46.643
           - I do have one idea.

30:52.117 --> 30:54.184
        So this is what I
        have to help them

30:54.253 --> 30:56.153
    find again, the Christmas

30:56.222 --> 30:58.155
        in that picture.
      - How do you do that?

30:58.224 --> 31:00.057
              - By finding a way

31:00.092 --> 31:02.025
      to open this centre,

31:02.061 --> 31:03.994
  so they can have the pageant
        and the potluck.

31:04.029 --> 31:06.463
  - I like where this is going.
        - Just one catch:

31:06.498 --> 31:09.533
 the centre needs a lot of work,
 and I don't even know how much.

31:09.602 --> 31:12.169
     And look, we can't even
    get inside the building.

31:12.204 --> 31:15.072
- Maybe you should talk to Jack.
          He strikes me

31:15.107 --> 31:18.175
     as a knowledgeable guy.
            - He is.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.244
But I get this feeling
when I'm with him

31:20.312 --> 31:22.279
that there's something
I'm missing...

31:22.314 --> 31:25.349
something important about him
that I should know and I don't.

31:25.417 --> 31:27.584
             - Hm. I'll tell you

31:27.620 --> 31:29.486
            what always helps me
            at a time like this:

31:29.521 --> 31:31.455
                 a nice, hot cup

31:31.523 --> 31:33.457
        of homemade apple cider.

31:33.492 --> 31:35.559
         - Apple cider?
       - Works every time.

31:35.628 --> 31:38.128
- And Michael, can you not do

31:38.197 --> 31:40.364
the whole vanishing thing
this time? You know, it's not

31:40.399 --> 31:42.332
       actually necessary.
             - What?

31:42.368 --> 31:46.136
 - But don't you think this is
really gonna be a great start?

31:46.171 --> 31:48.205
      (gently gusting wind)

31:49.909 --> 31:52.609
Aw, man! You're such a show-off!

32:09.828 --> 32:12.996
Well, in the meantime,
I got you something.

32:13.032 --> 32:15.232
             - Thank you, Gabby!

32:15.301 --> 32:17.668
- You are so welcome.

32:19.638 --> 32:21.939
                - So can I be in
          the Christmas pageant?

32:22.007 --> 32:23.941
- Oh, I hope so, honey,

32:24.009 --> 32:25.909
but I'm not sure quite yet.

32:25.978 --> 32:28.779
  - That's what they always say.

32:28.814 --> 32:31.715
          - Hey, Gabby.
       What can I get you?

32:31.784 --> 32:33.684
      - A cup of hot cider
          sounds good.

32:33.752 --> 32:36.153
- You got it.

32:37.723 --> 32:39.589
- All right. I'm gonna let you

32:39.658 --> 32:41.625
get back to this,
but that's a perfect angel!

32:41.660 --> 32:43.727
           I love it.

32:45.831 --> 32:48.532
    - Hey, Alice! Do you mind

32:48.600 --> 32:50.767
         if I join you?
             - Sure.

32:50.803 --> 32:53.637
     - Oh, great. Thank you.
        - You're welcome.

32:53.706 --> 32:56.173
    - Is this, um, the thing
      you were working on?

32:56.208 --> 32:58.642
- Yeah.

32:58.677 --> 33:00.978
        - It seems like everyone
                  in Angel Falls

33:01.013 --> 33:02.980
        is too busy to volunteer
                     these days.

33:03.048 --> 33:06.516
- Well, you're putting up fliers
on a bulletin board.

33:06.552 --> 33:09.186
It's not really gonna
get anyone's attention.

33:09.221 --> 33:11.788
              - Right. Yeah. I'm
         a little old-fashioned.

33:11.824 --> 33:15.125
     I'm not good with computers
               and the internet.

33:15.194 --> 33:16.893
- I mean,

33:16.929 --> 33:18.729
you could create
a Christmas website.

33:18.764 --> 33:20.564
That way, everyone
knows what you're doing.

33:20.599 --> 33:22.399
     - A Christmas website?
             - Yeah.

33:22.468 --> 33:24.468
   - I hadn't thought of that.
    - But it can't look like

33:24.503 --> 33:26.103
         all the others.
            - Right.

33:26.138 --> 33:29.072
- There's gotta be something
 special about it, you know?

33:29.108 --> 33:31.041
Something... that people here
wanna see.

33:31.076 --> 33:33.477
     - What about pictures?
             - Yeah.

33:33.512 --> 33:36.246
           - This is the church.

33:36.315 --> 33:38.281
Do you remember, with that star?
             - Yeah.

33:38.317 --> 33:40.784
                    - And here's
            the Christmas choir.

33:43.922 --> 33:47.124
- That's my dad.

33:47.192 --> 33:49.960
          - Right here?
             - Yeah.

33:50.029 --> 33:51.895
I used to do

33:51.964 --> 33:53.764
the Christmas pageant
every year.

33:53.799 --> 33:55.766
My dad would always

33:55.801 --> 33:57.734
sit right in the front row.

33:57.770 --> 34:00.971
 I could always see him smiling.

34:04.676 --> 34:06.710
                    - Oh, Alice.

34:06.779 --> 34:10.213
  Here. I want you to have that.

34:10.248 --> 34:12.983
- Thank you.

34:13.052 --> 34:16.018
               - You know, I was
       talking to Jenny earlier,

34:16.054 --> 34:18.487
        and this would have been
  her first year in the pageant.

34:18.524 --> 34:21.425
- Yeah.

34:21.493 --> 34:23.793
    - She's really disappointed.

34:25.431 --> 34:27.364
- That's too bad.

34:27.399 --> 34:29.666
              - You know, I have
                  this wild idea

34:29.701 --> 34:31.635
             that I could reopen

34:31.703 --> 34:33.469
            the centre and bring
               the pageant back.

34:33.505 --> 34:35.739
                But like I said,

34:35.774 --> 34:38.208
           I don't know anything
                 about computers

34:38.277 --> 34:41.978
 or the internet, so if you know
    anyone that could help me...

34:45.583 --> 34:48.485
- I don't, not really. No.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.687
 - Well, if you think of anyone,
               just let me know.

34:50.755 --> 34:53.723
              - OK.
- And good luck with your thing!

34:53.759 --> 34:55.692
- Thanks.

35:04.103 --> 35:06.002
              - Hi!
              - Oh!

35:06.071 --> 35:07.938
             - Hi. I don't know
             if you remember me.

35:08.006 --> 35:09.606
          I'm Gabby, I'm helping
              out at the church.

35:09.641 --> 35:12.542
  - Oh, yes. Of course. Hello.
              - Hi!

35:12.578 --> 35:15.212
         I hope you don't mind,
         but Jack told me that--

35:15.247 --> 35:17.347
  - You're a friend of Jack's?
             - Yeah.

35:17.382 --> 35:20.484
- Oh, he's been such a dear
ever since my...

35:20.519 --> 35:22.385
my Bryant passed.

35:22.421 --> 35:24.888
I always seem to have some
little crisis or other.

but Jack always

35:27.159 --> 35:29.626
comes roaring in
in his fire truck...

35:29.661 --> 35:31.595
just in case.

35:31.630 --> 35:33.563
  - Oh. Was Bryant your husband?

35:33.599 --> 35:35.599
- Yeah. Now there is a man

35:35.634 --> 35:37.934
who loved Christmas.

35:38.003 --> 35:40.837
We could barely get the tree
through the front door!

35:40.873 --> 35:44.007
I like to think about him
up there right now

35:44.076 --> 35:45.809
just celebrating
with the angels.

35:45.844 --> 35:47.944
           - Oh, I'm sure he is.

35:47.980 --> 35:49.613
- Oh, I'm Ellen.

35:49.681 --> 35:51.448
        - Ellen. I picked you up

35:51.517 --> 35:53.350
some fresh soup from the market.

35:53.385 --> 35:55.085
              - Oh!
   - And I know what you said

35:55.154 --> 35:57.320
          about Christmas trees,
                    but this one

35:57.356 --> 35:59.089
            is already decorated
                  and it doesn't

35:59.124 --> 36:01.258
               have any needles,
              so I hope it's OK.

36:01.293 --> 36:04.261
            - Oh, my.
       - I have a feeling

36:04.296 --> 36:06.196
      Bryant would be very happy

36:06.231 --> 36:08.431

          celebrating Christmas.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.201

36:11.270 --> 36:14.070

36:14.139 --> 36:17.440
thank you.

        for a volunteer?

36:26.885 --> 36:28.685
          - Definitely.
- What do you say we brighten up

36:28.720 --> 36:30.921
     that tree a little bit?
         - Well, I still

36:30.989 --> 36:33.890

of broken decorations.

36:33.959 --> 36:36.059

36:38.330 --> 36:40.964

from your store?

36:41.033 --> 36:43.166
- Let's just say they're
from an anonymous donor.

36:44.836 --> 36:47.571
     - So what do you think,
         Mr. Fire Chief?

36:47.639 --> 36:49.706
       - Yeah. I like it.

36:49.775 --> 36:51.608
 - So were you one of those kids

36:51.643 --> 36:53.643
       that always wanted
        to be a fireman?

36:53.712 --> 36:56.880
           - Yeah... I guess so.

36:56.915 --> 36:58.548
             My dad volunteered,

36:58.584 --> 37:00.984

grew up around the fire station.

37:01.019 --> 37:03.553

37:03.622 --> 37:05.722

37:08.427 --> 37:11.261

37:17.269 --> 37:19.236
                  there was a...

37:19.271 --> 37:22.205

37:22.241 --> 37:24.941

37:25.010 --> 37:27.010
        Just a normal barn fire,

37:27.045 --> 37:29.012
        but what none of us knew

37:29.047 --> 37:30.981
                   was the owner

37:31.016 --> 37:33.083

37:33.118 --> 37:36.286
- And your friend

37:36.355 --> 37:39.022

39:06.044 --> 39:08.778
              Dolores and Gloria
              had a falling out.

39:08.814 --> 39:10.714
          They were really close

39:10.749 --> 39:13.116

     the North Pole. Come on in.

55:34.265 --> 55:36.131
              - OK.
    - Let me take your coat.

I have some hot water in
the back. I can make you a tea.

55:38.636 --> 55:40.202

stop by to say hi.

  Christmas lights, weren't you?

          recommend it.

     definitely something in the

       - What do you mean?

55:53.284 --> 55:54.883

55:54.919 --> 55:57.052
    Cookies from Ellen Price.
     You might remember her

55:57.088 --> 56:00.389
as the sweet lady
whose soup boiled over.

56:00.424 --> 56:02.424
          Look at that.
             - Wow!

is I'm gonna be a blimp

56:14.271 --> 56:16.805

and it's all your fault.

56:16.841 --> 56:18.774

01:01:39.963 --> 01:01:41.763
                  was because it

   - Yeah, they are my family,

01:01:57.815 --> 01:01:59.748
but I also said I wanted to keep
   them safe. So when the city

01:01:59.817 --> 01:02:01.583
 couldn't come up with the money
         to finish this,

01:02:01.618 --> 01:02:04.086

01:02:28.145 --> 01:02:30.312

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:32.547

that was going to happen.

01:02:45.562 --> 01:02:47.529
                        - Maybe.

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:05.881

01:03:05.916 --> 01:03:07.582

             - Yes!

     It's what they remember

  Angel Falls needs to get its
  Christmas spirit back again.

01:03:19.263 --> 01:03:22.697
 - Take a look around you. Look
at how much work there is to do.

01:03:22.766 --> 01:03:25.500
      - I know, but we also
      have this whole town

       used to feel like.

        that's humanly possible.

01:03:42.286 --> 01:03:44.052

       to give Angel Falls

01:04:16.119 --> 01:04:18.720
- We gotta rewire
the light panel still.

01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:20.922

   - Test fire alarms: check.

01:04:20.958 --> 01:04:23.225
         - That's good.
        - Patch the hole

we've got that one. OK. What you

01:04:25.395 --> 01:04:27.195

        - Um, recycling!

01:04:27.231 --> 01:04:30.398

           - Windows!

01:04:30.467 --> 01:04:32.234

             - Yeah.

  Hey, Tommy. You need a hand?
     - No. I got it, Chief.

get some rest.

               Hi.

                         Me too.

01:12:46.196 --> 01:12:48.162
- How did you know?

01:12:48.198 --> 01:12:50.164
           - It was...

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:52.066
         just a feeling.
          - No, no, no.

When you touched me,

01:12:54.137 --> 01:12:57.038
I could feel that you
knew she was OK.

           - Gabby...

I've never felt anything
like that before.

01:13:02.579 --> 01:13:05.046
It was like every Christmas
morning I've ever known

all rolled into one,
and everything

01:13:07.083 --> 01:13:09.417
 I've ever wanted in one moment.

      - And the only thing
  that I can think of right now

01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:16.991
is you being here is the best
thing that's ever happened

01:13:17.026 --> 01:13:19.160
to me, and I don't wanna spend

01:13:19.195 --> 01:13:21.062
 another Christmas
without you in it.

01:13:21.131 --> 01:13:24.332

01:13:24.401 --> 01:13:27.368

 I went a little overboard again

01:13:47.957 --> 01:13:50.625
      and I'm really sorry.
            - I know.

01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:53.127
       - But Jack was so worried
                    about Alice,

01:13:53.196 --> 01:13:55.129
           I just wanted to make
              sure she was safe.

01:13:55.198 --> 01:13:57.064
         - I understand.
     - I know my assignment

01:13:57.133 --> 01:13:59.233
      was to bring the Christmas
  spirit back to the whole town,

01:13:59.302 --> 01:14:01.269
  and I was making a difference.
              You could feel it!

01:14:01.304 --> 01:14:04.005
- You let yourself
get involved again, Gabby!

01:14:04.073 --> 01:14:06.874
     More than ever before.
    - But Jack was so worried

01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:09.076
           about her, and I knew
          if something happened,

01:14:09.145 --> 01:14:10.812
    it would be too much for him

01:14:10.847 --> 01:14:12.647

               Not at Christmas.

01:14:12.682 --> 01:14:14.615

           - He's such

01:14:14.651 --> 01:14:17.985
         a good person, Michael.
    Think of everything he does,

01:14:18.054 --> 01:14:21.422
    all the people he helps.
      - He is a good man...

01:14:21.491 --> 01:14:25.359
who loves you very much.

01:14:28.965 --> 01:14:30.932

       What I didn't understand.

01:14:38.408 --> 01:14:41.609
              So this is what it
       feels like to be in love.

01:14:44.781 --> 01:14:46.747
- It's time to go.

01:14:46.783 --> 01:14:48.716
    - But I don't want to leave.

01:14:48.751 --> 01:14:51.953
- I'm sorry, Gabby.

01:14:51.988 --> 01:14:53.888
Angels and people

01:14:53.923 --> 01:14:57.191

my feelings are for Jack,
that's no reason

without its Christmas spirit.

Not now,
not when we're this close.

the pageant for the kids.

about this Christmas.

It's about next year
and the year after that

with Jack

01:16:20.643 --> 01:16:23.477

01:20:56.853 --> 01:20:59.820
Angels and people are not
allowed to fall in love.

01:20:59.889 --> 01:21:02.056
               - I don't want to
            be an angel anymore.

01:21:02.091 --> 01:21:04.024
           - You what?
            - I want

01:21:04.093 --> 01:21:06.093
                 to be a person.

01:21:07.496 --> 01:21:10.097
            I wanna live my life
                   on this earth

01:21:10.132 --> 01:21:12.566
    with all of the love and joy

01:21:12.602 --> 01:21:15.903
                 that comes from
          making my own choices.

01:21:17.773 --> 01:21:19.240
        But most of all, I wanna

01:21:19.275 --> 01:21:21.175
        spend my life with Jack.

01:21:21.244 --> 01:21:23.944
 I wanna know what it feels like

01:21:24.013 --> 01:21:26.814
 to be with the man that I love.

01:21:26.883 --> 01:21:29.817
- Are you sure about this?

01:21:32.688 --> 01:21:36.423
- I've spent a millennia helping
    people find their true love.

01:21:38.127 --> 01:21:41.395
       Shouldn't I have a chance
         to experience that too?

01:21:43.232 --> 01:21:45.566
   This is what I want, Michael.

01:21:45.635 --> 01:21:48.936
   It's what I've always wanted.

01:21:50.606 --> 01:21:52.539
- Like I said...

01:21:52.575 --> 01:21:54.541
a special assignment.

01:21:54.577 --> 01:21:56.644
                - Wait a second!

01:21:56.679 --> 01:21:58.646
                       You knew?

01:21:58.681 --> 01:22:01.148
- It was always your decision.

01:22:01.183 --> 01:22:03.317
Free will.

01:22:03.352 --> 01:22:05.219
Do you remember?

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:13.027
           - I'm gonna miss you.

01:22:13.062 --> 01:22:16.030
- Oh, don't worry.
 I'll be around...

01:22:18.801 --> 01:22:20.901
...just in case.

01:22:26.142 --> 01:22:28.075
           - Ha ha ha!

01:22:28.144 --> 01:22:30.077
       (exhaling heavily)
               Oh.

01:22:30.146 --> 01:22:33.113
