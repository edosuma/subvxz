00:28.779 --> 00:30.110
I'm not sure
I'm that guy anymore.

00:30.281 --> 00:34.194
It's just, you know,
kind of sad when
you look back on your life

00:34.285 --> 00:36.196
and you realize
it hasn't amounted
to much.

00:36.287 --> 00:37.242
What are you
talking about?

00:37.330 --> 00:39.571
Your whole life has been
about trying to help people.

00:39.665 --> 00:43.999
But I don't remember
actually helping anybody.

01:24.543 --> 01:26.408
With no compass
to guide us,

01:26.504 --> 01:29.792
how can we know
if our destiny is
to seek the good

01:32.176 --> 01:35.964
or obey the demons
that whisper in our ear?

How are you feeling, Hiro?

02:04.500 --> 02:07.207
You collapsed
in my apartment
last night.

02:08.212 --> 02:09.713
You remember?

02:12.550 --> 02:14.256
And you brought me
to the hospital?

02:18.222 --> 02:20.053
I spoke to the doctors.

02:20.891 --> 02:22.631
Hiro, you're very sick.

02:22.727 --> 02:26.515
Yes, I know.
Brain tumor.
I'm dying.

02:28.399 --> 02:33.109
I guess I didn't want to
believe that I would end up
in a hospital bed so soon,

02:34.196 --> 02:35.652
but here I am.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.698
Look, I know about dying.

02:45.249 --> 02:47.956
I've helped a lot of people
through this transition.

02:48.044 --> 02:50.581
I'm gonna help you
with whatever you need.

02:51.255 --> 02:52.711
Maybe that's why
you came to me.

02:53.090 --> 02:54.250
Maybe.

02:56.427 --> 02:57.917
But maybe not.

to different places,
different times,

03:02.433 --> 03:04.924

Maybe destiny has
brought me to you, Peter,
to fix a problem in your life.

03:10.900 --> 03:13.186
No, my...
My life is fine.

03:13.277 --> 03:14.642
I really don't need
any fixing.

03:18.949 --> 03:23.534
What if you didn't come here
so that you can fix me?

03:23.621 --> 03:25.236
What if you're here
so that I can fix you?

03:25.623 --> 03:27.705
I've seen the best doctors
in Japan.

03:27.792 --> 03:29.077
There's nothing
that can be done.

03:29.168 --> 03:30.954
Maybe not by doctors.

03:33.422 --> 03:35.128
The faster I can go,

03:38.302 --> 03:39.542
the faster I can get back.

03:41.430 --> 03:43.295
Just sit tight, okay?

03:45.226 --> 03:47.763

Okay.

03:52.441 --> 03:54.147
Are you okay?

Did you send a cello
to my apartment?

03:56.779 --> 03:58.144
Cello? No.

about it with you,

And it can't wait.

04:21.637 --> 04:23.173
You know what?

04:24.640 --> 04:28.098
You have questions
about abilities,
you should talk to him.

04:28.185 --> 04:30.471

there is to know
about abilities.

04:33.858 --> 04:37.646

And I'll be back soon.

two sides at war

Good morning, Sylar.
How'd you sleep?

05:54.104 --> 05:56.095
You called me Sylar.

That's your name.

05:58.609 --> 06:01.476
I don't know.

my name is Gabriel.

know your name?

to us to heal.

I mean, you're taking me in,

You don't even know me.

across a room.

if I can find a healer.

over here, Noah.

I want you to help me
locate one.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.449
What about my blood?
Can't you take me
back with you?

10:19.536 --> 10:21.276
We can give him
a blood transfusion.

10:21.371 --> 10:24.329
That won't work.
A tumor is living tissue.

10:24.416 --> 10:27.158
Your blood's regenerative
powers would only
make it grow faster.

10:27.753 --> 10:31.587

to four years ago.

could be a couple of hours.

but ifjust the leg's
still twitching,

10:49.733 --> 10:52.770
all he had to do
was touch them,
and away they would fly.

10:52.861 --> 10:56.149
We studied him for
four days and, of course,
erased his memory.

10:56.573 --> 10:59.030
He was a good kid.
Or he wanted to be.

10:59.117 --> 11:02.109
He couldn't decide
if his power was
a gift or a curse.

11:02.663 --> 11:05.279
Well, if he can save Hiro,
it's definitely a gift.

How you steal powers
from other people.

when that happens.

13:35.691 --> 13:37.272
My hand just rises up
and can suddenly do

13:37.359 --> 13:38.940
these incredible things.
Like motor memory.

Memories don't only
exist in the mind.
The body retains everything.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.990

13:51.081 --> 13:52.070
You mean
flying in a plane?

13:52.165 --> 13:53.575
I mean like piloting a jet.

In the military, maybe.

something to you.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.346

would return on their own,

but that's just
not happening.

who you really are,

I'm Hiro.

15:02.819 --> 15:08.485
Yeah. Peter Petrelli said
I can ask you questions
about my abilities.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.028
You have a power?

15:11.119 --> 15:12.620
How can I make it stop?

15:14.164 --> 15:17.156
No. Manifesting a power
is a wondrous time.

refuses the call.

How do I turn it off?

15:39.064 --> 15:43.649
It's not a light switch.
It's part of who you are.

Not exactly
what you'd expect
from a healer, huh?

15:59.709 --> 16:00.869
So, what do you know
about this kid?

16:00.961 --> 16:02.076
Not that much.

16:02.170 --> 16:06.163
You know, I tested him,
I wrote up a report,
threw it in a file,

16:07.134 --> 16:08.715
but the kid was just
coming into his ability.

16:08.802 --> 16:12.090
He had a lot of questions,
so naturally we wiped
his memory,

16:12.180 --> 16:14.045
sent him back
to his messed-up family.

16:14.141 --> 16:15.381
I went on
to my next assignment.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.557
The Company was
never what you'd call
a support group.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.475
Yeah, more about powers
and less about the people.

16:19.563 --> 16:20.803
That's right.

16:21.356 --> 16:22.687
You saw him heal, right?

16:22.774 --> 16:25.265
Yeah, bugs,

16:25.360 --> 16:27.146
Day four, I slashed my arm
pretty bad.

16:27.237 --> 16:29.228
The kid touched it,
it was as good as new.

doesn't work on birds.

happened here?

17:11.448 --> 17:13.154
There was a case.

17:13.241 --> 17:15.357
In China, this woman
manifested as a healer,

17:15.452 --> 17:18.740
but as time went on,
it evolved into
something very different.

17:19.706 --> 17:23.824
There was a flip side.
She could control
the flow of life.

17:23.919 --> 17:25.534

Or take it away.

17:26.963 --> 17:28.043

(DOOR CLOSES)
She's right, Hiro.
You're sick.

32:48.676 --> 32:51.964
You need to stop
using your power
before it kills you.

32:52.054 --> 32:55.137
But my power
isn't killing me,
it keeps me alive.

32:55.933 --> 32:57.969
When I was stuck
in my cubicle every day,

32:58.060 --> 33:01.143
wasting my life,
that's when l was dying.

33:01.230 --> 33:05.394
How can you be
so focused helping others,
knowing what it might cost?

33:06.235 --> 33:08.100
I had a friend once.

33:08.195 --> 33:12.404
She knew she was dying,
but that didn't push her
off her path.

33:12.491 --> 33:16.825
She taught me to keep
joy and dignity alive,
even in the face of death.

33:18.038 --> 33:19.778
Her name was Charlie.

33:20.833 --> 33:25.076
Oh, my God.
I can't believe
I left her off the list.

33:25.171 --> 33:27.662
What? What are you doing?

33:27.756 --> 33:29.621
(GASPS) Paper and pen, stat.

33:32.887 --> 33:37.051
I had a list.
A list of all the wrongs
l have to right before I die.

33:37.892 --> 33:39.428
I can't believe
I forgot her.

33:44.607 --> 33:45.847
Hiro.

33:46.775 --> 33:49.562
Promise me you won't leave
until Peter returns.

33:54.992 --> 33:57.529
There's been an accident
at 2627, Otsego.

33:57.620 --> 34:00.453
Please send the police
and the coroner.

34:02.917 --> 34:04.498
Did you get his ability?

34:04.585 --> 34:05.745
Yeah.

34:06.587 --> 34:07.576
So, what next?

34:07.671 --> 34:11.209
Well, there's an airfield
about six miles south
of here off the highway.

34:11.300 --> 34:13.962
I called in a favor
and I got you a ride.

34:14.053 --> 34:15.793
It's not as fast
as the way
you got here, but...

34:15.888 --> 34:16.877

34:16.972 --> 34:18.007

Okay, so,
ljerry-rigged the heater
and I backed up the vent.

34:43.666 --> 34:46.157
It's gonna look like
carbon monoxide poisoning,
okay?

34:46.252 --> 34:49.836
You came home
and you found them,
all right?

34:52.841 --> 34:54.672
You're staying here?

34:55.427 --> 34:56.507
Yeah.

34:56.929 --> 34:58.669
How long?

34:58.764 --> 35:00.300
Until I know that
you're all right.

35:03.102 --> 35:08.517
Jeremy, it used to be myjob
to watch over people like you.

35:12.778 --> 35:15.110
I lost my way.
I dropped the ball.

You may not even know it,

35:26.458 --> 35:28.198

I followed that bastard.

he wouldn't follow through.

to us like this?
