You ever feel
self-conscious,

Telling people that you work
at a comic book store?

00:06.462 --> 00:09.514
Whew, I still do at times,
you know?

00:09.548 --> 00:12.233
You meet captains of industry
out there.

00:12.268 --> 00:13.918
They ask, you know,
"what do you do for a living?"

00:13.953 --> 00:15.236
You gotta tell them you work
at a comic book store?

00:15.271 --> 00:16.721
Yeah, but you get
to tell people

00:16.772 --> 00:19.607
At least,
"I manage a comic book store,"

00:19.642 --> 00:22.010
Whereas I tell people,
"I work under a guy,"

00:22.044 --> 00:25.646
And they're like, "there are
two guys who actually do this?"

even realize

00:26.982 --> 00:29.183
That you should've been
this self-conscious

00:29.218 --> 00:30.451
- About your position?
- Yeah, seriously.

00:30.486 --> 00:33.221
No, but, I mean,
I would've felt like--hey!

00:33.255 --> 00:34.789
At least I have a job.

00:34.823 --> 00:36.991
What makes you think
I don't have a job?

- Where did you get it?

02:37.513 --> 02:39.380
I picked this machine
out of a hoarder's house.

one day,

03:02.638 --> 03:04.172
So was Walter,
door kicks open.

he grabs a pool stick.

Then he hit
the Asteroids machine,

03:22.958 --> 03:23.925
Doesn't have a joystick,

Looking at it, stymied,

03:27.930 --> 03:29.330
'cause there was nothing
to fellate.

And instead, he was just like--

I don't disagree, man,
but it's a bit pricey though.

Would you take $500?

04:14.743 --> 04:15.910

I'd go that low.

04:17.279 --> 04:20.447
You do realize, like,

For, like, for 99Â¢

04:22.017 --> 04:24.318

with the app.

That's the best I can do.

04:37.366 --> 04:39.667
I think the lowest I would
take for the unit is $900,

And I may make you throw
in a t-shirt for that,

as I'm going.

interested in it.

to the Stash.

the first Morbius.

07:01.168 --> 07:03.453
Let me just see
what it looks like.

07:03.504 --> 07:05.238
Well, right off the bat,
it's--

07:05.272 --> 07:07.807

some spine damage,

But not a bad-looking book,
you know?

07:16.016 --> 07:19.719
1971, that's an oldie
right there.

07:19.753 --> 07:22.388
We had a guy come in

07:22.422 --> 07:24.857
Amazing Spider-Man 101.

07:24.892 --> 07:27.860
That would be the death
of Gwen Stacy?

07:27.895 --> 07:30.729
That would be the birth
of the Living Vampire.

07:30.747 --> 07:32.248
- Morbius.
- Yes.

07:32.282 --> 07:36.102
Oh, Lord, and why exactly
was he "The Living Vampire"?

07:36.136 --> 07:38.604
I believe
the story goes

07:38.639 --> 07:40.923
That the code was in effect,
and the code said,

07:40.958 --> 07:44.126
You cannot use vampires
in your stories--

07:44.178 --> 07:47.914
You can't use the undead
in your story.

07:47.948 --> 07:49.515
So Marvel found their way
around it by going,

07:49.550 --> 07:52.101
"Oh, he's not dead.
He's living."

07:52.135 --> 07:54.687
He's a scientific vampire
created by science.

07:54.721 --> 07:56.022
He has to drink blood,

07:56.056 --> 07:58.391
But he's not dead.
[laughter]

07:58.425 --> 08:01.427
Ingenious way around it, man.
Code's like, "foiled again."

08:01.461 --> 08:03.362
And he was a cool-looking
character too, man.

08:03.397 --> 08:04.730
He had that long hair.

08:04.764 --> 08:05.982
He looked
kind of like a partridge,

08:06.033 --> 08:07.149
But a bad-ass partridge.

08:07.201 --> 08:09.035
Like a partridge
in a pear tree

08:09.069 --> 08:11.070
Or like a partridge
from The Partridge family?

08:11.104 --> 08:14.340
- Like Keith Partridge.
- Yeah.

08:14.374 --> 08:17.743
121,
death of Gwen Stacy.

08:17.778 --> 08:19.612
This one looks all right.
Got a nice...

08:19.646 --> 08:21.881
- Yeah.
- Punisher first appearance.

08:21.915 --> 08:23.349
Best boots in the business
right there.

08:23.383 --> 08:25.751
Only a man can pull off
wearing work boots.

08:30.691 --> 08:33.226
And I definitely
would have an interest

08:33.260 --> 08:34.927
In the 9/11 issue
of Spider-Man.

08:34.962 --> 08:36.996

like, after I read it.

08:37.030 --> 08:39.198
Signed, John Romita Jr.

08:39.232 --> 08:42.784
To commemorate September 11th,
Marvel put out a comic book

08:42.818 --> 08:44.403
Written by
J. Michael Straczynski, I think.

08:44.438 --> 08:45.821
- Yes.
- A Spider-Man comic.

08:45.873 --> 08:47.273
Drawn by John Romita Jr.

08:47.307 --> 08:48.491

09:00.086 --> 09:02.471
So when September 11th
happened,

09:02.522 --> 09:03.723
You know, they felt like,

09:03.757 --> 09:05.091
"Look, we should comment.
We should do something."

09:05.125 --> 09:06.142
"We should acknowledge
that it happened

09:06.193 --> 09:07.526
In our universe too."

09:07.561 --> 09:09.729
Particularly because it's so--
when you think about,

09:09.763 --> 09:11.030
When you read comic books,

09:11.064 --> 09:12.765
There's always
some major villain

09:12.783 --> 09:14.567
Trying to do
something horrific

09:14.601 --> 09:16.569
To New York,
to some community.

09:16.603 --> 09:20.539
So here in real life,
something, like, ultra-horrific,

09:20.574 --> 09:23.376
So horrific it almost came
out of something fictional,

09:23.410 --> 09:26.111
Happened, and so they
decided to commemorate,

09:26.129 --> 09:27.246

16:38.552 --> 16:41.253
Announce the first
intercompany crossover,

16:41.288 --> 16:42.922
And it was breathtaking.

16:42.956 --> 16:44.457
Spider-Man
versus Superman.

16:44.491 --> 16:45.958
What's
your favorite crossover?

16:45.992 --> 16:48.027
- Be all, end all?
- Yeah.

16:48.061 --> 16:50.896
Archie met the Punisher
in the '90s.

16:50.914 --> 16:51.981
- [laughing]
- Yeah.

16:52.032 --> 16:53.699
Did he take him on
as an apprentice?

16:53.733 --> 16:55.000
No,
he came to Riverdale.

16:55.034 --> 16:56.619
I guess some kids were selling
some crack or something.

16:56.653 --> 16:57.970
Like,
Punisher kicks the door in,

16:58.004 --> 17:02.041
Archie's in a crack house,
going, "Come on, daddy.

17:02.075 --> 17:04.643
Let me just take a hit
off this glass."

17:04.678 --> 17:07.279
- Whoa, check it out, man.
- Hey.

17:07.314 --> 17:08.614
Holy crap.

17:08.647 --> 17:09.915
Going to see
what I can do with this.

17:09.933 --> 17:11.282
Star Wars fan?

17:11.317 --> 17:14.019
Just a bit.
Just a little bit, yeah.

17:14.054 --> 17:16.005
So you're looking to move
some Battleships today, huh?

17:16.039 --> 17:19.058
Yeah.

17:30.203 --> 17:32.571
So you're looking to move
all three of these, huh?

17:32.589 --> 17:33.572
- Yeah.
- How come?

17:33.590 --> 17:36.108
Well, my girlfriend,

17:36.142 --> 17:38.477
She lives in England,
and I want to fly her over.

17:38.511 --> 17:40.479
It's been six months now
over the internet,

17:40.513 --> 17:42.047
And I want her
to meet my family.

17:42.082 --> 17:44.116
But you know it's love though?

17:44.150 --> 17:47.253
I couldn't possibly make
this work for six months.

17:47.287 --> 17:49.188
Over the internet
if she wasn't--

17:49.222 --> 17:50.689
I remember
when I first met my wife.

17:50.724 --> 17:52.558
I would have sold anything
like this gentleman

17:52.592 --> 17:54.360
If she lived
across the pond.

17:54.394 --> 17:57.213
You ever dome some kind
of large, romantic gesture.

17:57.264 --> 17:59.965
That's, like, completely
out of character for you?

18:00.000 --> 18:01.350
You were a part of it.

18:01.401 --> 18:03.135
You proposed to my wife
for me.

18:03.153 --> 18:05.271
Oh, my god, that's right.
I was involved.

18:05.305 --> 18:07.239
[laughing]

18:07.274 --> 18:08.874
Walter wanted
to propose to his lady,

18:08.909 --> 18:11.810
So his thing was,
he was holding up a big sign

18:11.845 --> 18:14.113
That said,
"Marry me, Debbie."

18:14.147 --> 18:16.348
I was to simply go
into the school,

18:16.382 --> 18:18.267
Knock on her door,
and to instruct her

18:18.318 --> 18:19.385
To look out the window.

18:19.419 --> 18:22.788
So I knock on the door.
I said, "Hi, Deb.

18:22.822 --> 18:25.524
Walter would like you
to look out the window."

18:25.559 --> 18:27.326
And her first response,

18:27.360 --> 18:30.362
She goes, "Why?"
[laughter]

18:30.397 --> 18:32.147
He comes sailing off the roof
with a noose around his neck.

18:32.198 --> 18:34.733
"This is for you, Damien."
[laughter]

18:34.768 --> 18:36.802
What are you looking to get
for these three?

18:36.836 --> 18:38.954
I'm looking at $750.

18:39.005 --> 18:40.806
Whoa, she's not taking
a Starship here, is she?

18:40.840 --> 18:43.609
[laughter]

18:43.643 --> 18:44.677
What's the Millennium Falcon

18:44.711 --> 18:46.595
And an Imperial Shuttle

18:46.646 --> 18:48.547
And a Starship
go for nowadays?

18:48.582 --> 18:50.983
I remember picking this one up
for, like, $55, $60.

18:51.001 --> 18:52.351
Okay.

18:52.385 --> 18:55.254
I mean, this one's
maybe worth around $95 now.

18:55.288 --> 18:58.123
- Imperial Shuttle.
- Maybe about $200.

18:58.158 --> 19:00.459
- So that goes for $200.
- Yeah, the Starship.

19:00.493 --> 19:04.096
Think this one goes probably
around the $200 range.

19:04.130 --> 19:06.982
Well, I'm glad you're here.
Never heard that before, right?

19:07.017 --> 19:08.017
Oh, very rarely.

19:08.068 --> 19:11.604
Especially at home. [laughter]

19:11.638 --> 19:17.476
I could offer you,
for these three ships...

19:17.510 --> 19:18.627
$250.

19:18.662 --> 19:20.579
At $250,
I'd have to ship her U.P.S.

19:20.597 --> 19:22.047
You know,
I got to find something

19:22.082 --> 19:24.583
- A little more than that.
- $350.

19:24.617 --> 19:26.085
Is there any way
we can do more than $350?

19:26.119 --> 19:30.422
Any way, with all the love
in your heart?

19:30.457 --> 19:32.975
$450.

19:33.009 --> 19:34.827
$600?

19:34.861 --> 19:36.161
$500?

19:36.196 --> 19:38.631
$550.

19:38.665 --> 19:40.833
[groans] No.

19:40.867 --> 19:42.134
Not a chance, brother.
Take $500.

19:42.168 --> 19:43.686
So then $500 it is!
Sounds great.

19:43.737 --> 19:45.604
- $500 sounds great.
- All right.

19:45.639 --> 19:47.239
- All right.
- $500.

19:47.273 --> 19:49.608
All right, man, I really hope
you don't screw this up, man.

19:49.643 --> 19:51.210
Get her over here.
Get a ring on her finger.

19:51.244 --> 19:54.213
Come back
and tell me 20 years from now--

19:54.247 --> 19:56.548
- I spent the money
on bath salts.

19:56.583 --> 19:57.783
[laughter]

19:57.817 --> 19:59.001
- All right.
- Pressure's on.

19:59.035 --> 20:00.152
Can't tell you
what this means to me.

20:00.170 --> 20:01.286
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Mike.

20:01.304 --> 20:02.721
- It will go to a good home.
- Thank you.

20:02.756 --> 20:03.856
Good luck.

20:03.890 --> 20:06.091
That's
some serious long distance.

20:06.109 --> 20:07.593
It worked for me though.

20:07.627 --> 20:09.228
Me and my wife had
a long-distance relationship

20:09.262 --> 20:10.229
For, like, three years.

20:10.263 --> 20:12.381
How tough was that?

20:12.415 --> 20:15.334
It wasn't easy,
and I was going nuts, man.

20:15.368 --> 20:17.736
I never knew
you were this, like--

20:17.771 --> 20:19.505
- Yeah.

20:19.539 --> 20:21.940
[laughter]

20:21.975 --> 20:23.108
I'm going to get you something
to take your mind off it.

20:23.126 --> 20:24.343
Okay.

20:24.377 --> 20:27.079
I guess, price these,
put 'em up somewhere,

20:27.113 --> 20:29.531
And see if we can make back
the money at least.

20:29.582 --> 20:31.300
- Okay, all right.
- Thanks.

20:31.351 --> 20:35.421
This is the first one going up.

20:35.455 --> 20:38.424
- He's a freak, ain't he?
- Adds "horn dog" to his resume.

20:38.458 --> 20:40.592
[laughter]

20:40.627 --> 20:42.416
Sex, comic books, hockey--

20:42.417 --> 20:44.403
All the good things
come to an end, kids.

20:44.404 --> 20:45.704
Just like this show.

20:45.705 --> 20:48.105
Thanks for hanging out
with me and the comic book men.

20:48.106 --> 20:50.034
Until next week.
I'm your host, Kevin Smith.

20:50.035 --> 20:52.054
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

20:52.055 --> 20:53.555
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

20:53.556 --> 20:54.856
Don't make us angry.

20:54.857 --> 20:56.857
You wouldn't like us
when we're angry.
