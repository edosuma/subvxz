WEBVTT

00:00.376 --> 00:01.542
You seem a little distracted.

00:01.669 --> 00:04.253
I'm kind of facing
a difficult career decision.

00:04.380 --> 00:06.464
Smile, Mills, you're going to be a cop.

00:06.590 --> 00:08.216
Previously on "Chicago Fire..."

00:08.342 --> 00:10.968
As far as I'm concerned,
it's our time now.

00:13.138 --> 00:14.138
Help!

00:15.015 --> 00:16.516
This is the man who saved me.

00:17.309 --> 00:19.227
Lisa and I still have
unfinished business.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.229
I loaned her some money
when we were together.

00:21.355 --> 00:22.188
Get the hell out.

00:22.314 --> 00:24.107
These are the new assignments
for your people.

00:24.233 --> 00:28.194
You all have one more shift together.
Then Firehouse 51 will be closing.

00:29.988 --> 00:32.532
- Five bucks, right?
- No.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.287
- Five bucks!
- Oh!

00:43.043 --> 00:45.586
Oh, man. All right, you know what?

00:45.713 --> 00:47.296
I can't believe they're closing us down.

00:48.716 --> 00:49.716
Yeah.

00:52.177 --> 00:53.678
51 saved my life, man.

01:04.106 --> 01:06.232
She said you'd be here.

01:12.614 --> 01:16.033
Wow. Turn around. Go.

01:16.160 --> 01:18.953
Two grand, Clarke.
That's what I gave your wife.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.497
So either I get it back,
or we just call it what it was.

01:21.623 --> 01:24.333
A transaction between a man and a whore.

01:24.460 --> 01:26.794
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Get the hell out of here, Hayes!

01:26.920 --> 01:29.964
You hear me? Next time I see you,
I'll kill you! I will kill you!

01:30.090 --> 01:33.217
You're not gonna pay?
I'll just have to collect it myself.

01:33.385 --> 01:34.886
Leave. Now!

01:45.981 --> 01:47.482
You know, this is our last shift.

01:47.608 --> 01:51.027
Once we're at separate houses,
there's no need to hide.

01:51.153 --> 01:52.528
That would be nice.

01:55.282 --> 01:56.991
Hey, why don't we just tell
everybody today?

01:57.117 --> 02:00.745
- I mean, they're our friends.
- Yeah, we should.

02:00.871 --> 02:04.624
- Let's do it at the end.
- Hey!

02:04.750 --> 02:06.584
I just can't believe
that Zoya up and left.

02:07.961 --> 02:11.339
It's for the best, trust me. I mean, you
guys were racing the clock to do this.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.466
That's never a recipe for success.

02:13.592 --> 02:16.427
- I really dug her.
- She liked you, too.

02:16.553 --> 02:19.388
And just when I felt like things were
falling into place with my brother.

02:19.515 --> 02:21.057
And now he's gone, too.

02:21.183 --> 02:25.728
Look, Zoya did ask me
to give you this, okay?

02:25.854 --> 02:27.980
She said, "Please don't be mad at me."

02:28.106 --> 02:31.818
Or at least she said...
Which roughly translates to that.

02:32.861 --> 02:33.986
A mix CD.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.488
I hear you, Jan.

02:35.614 --> 02:38.783
Trust me, we have done everything
we can to try and save this house.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.452
Where's the next closest one,
five miles away?

02:41.578 --> 02:43.704
What's that do to response times?

02:43.831 --> 02:45.164
It doesn't help, that's for sure.

02:45.290 --> 02:46.833
So how do they justify it?

02:46.959 --> 02:48.960
Like most things,
it comes down to money.

02:49.086 --> 02:51.629
- Kelly!
- Hey, Nathan!

02:51.755 --> 02:54.048
- How you doing, buddy?
- The arm's great.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.801
- I made the basketball team!
- Great. That's amazing.

02:56.927 --> 02:58.177
All of you...

02:58.303 --> 03:01.639
I want you to know we share
your concerns about the neighborhood.

03:01.765 --> 03:05.268
We have always been
a neighborhood house and we...

03:08.397 --> 03:09.814
We're sorry.

03:13.861 --> 03:14.861
Thank you.

03:16.488 --> 03:18.865
I'm sure you've done
everything you could.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.785
Stay safe, all of you.

03:25.289 --> 03:28.791
He put his name on the line for us.
His career.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.293
You got any ideas?

03:32.170 --> 03:34.797
Nothing we haven't talked about
a hundred times.

03:34.923 --> 03:38.009
- But I'm not ready to quit.
- No, I hear that.

03:40.345 --> 03:41.971
We got one more shift.

03:43.974 --> 03:48.102
These are our new firehouse assignments,
starting next shift.

03:48.228 --> 03:51.063
Some of you will be floating
until they can find a permanent home.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.024
Others, this is it.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.993
You know what?

04:04.661 --> 04:08.539
One thing I learned during my campaign
is that I should've fought till the end.

04:08.665 --> 04:13.127
I regret that I didn't put my foot on
Sullivan's throat when I had the chance.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.087
Mouch is right.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.174
We still have 24 hours.

04:18.300 --> 04:22.053
What do they say at the Academy?
"One shift can change someone's life."

04:22.971 --> 04:26.140
- Let's change ours.
- We rally the troops.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.851
- Reach out to everyone we know.
- And go after McLeod.

04:32.648 --> 04:36.442
Truck 81, Squad 3,
Ambulance 61, Battalion 25.

04:36.568 --> 04:38.819
Vehicle accident, 88 West Loomis Street.

04:41.073 --> 04:44.367
I hear the sirens.
It's gonna be okay. Just hang on.

04:44.493 --> 04:47.286
They're here.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.747
Okay, we're... We're gonna get you out.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.917
It's my fault. I should
have double-checked the chains.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.043
Show me.

04:54.169 --> 04:56.295
He was in a hurry,
so I released the locking system,

04:56.421 --> 04:57.672
but the chains should have held.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.757
Okay, we have seconds here,
people, not minutes.

04:59.883 --> 05:00.925
So let's go! Go! Go!

05:01.051 --> 05:03.260
Mills, Mouch, give me two chain bags
to the top deck.

05:03.387 --> 05:04.387
On it.

05:05.806 --> 05:09.058
- Can you hear me, sir? Are you hurt?
- I don't know!

05:09.184 --> 05:11.894
Guys, give me the jaws,
cutters and the ram! Let's move!

05:12.020 --> 05:14.021
- What's your name?
- Isaac!

05:15.399 --> 05:18.192
- Try and stay calm, sir.
- Please, help me! Please!

05:18.318 --> 05:20.820
- We need to stabilize him!
- Wait till we secure the car.

05:20.946 --> 05:23.322
- Chief, it won't take long.
- I said no.

05:38.296 --> 05:39.505
Please, help me!

05:56.023 --> 05:56.856
Mouch, talk to me.

05:56.982 --> 05:59.650
- We're locked down!
- Car's secured.

06:06.116 --> 06:08.576
Okay, Cruz, let it out, nice and easy.

06:19.963 --> 06:20.963
Go.

06:24.843 --> 06:27.845
Hey, hey, hey! Stay awake, Isaac!
That's it. Eyes on me!

06:29.181 --> 06:30.556
Clarke, cutters!

06:37.898 --> 06:39.565
Okay, Isaac, we're almost there.

06:39.691 --> 06:42.443
- All right. Ram's in position!
- What's happening?

06:49.117 --> 06:50.284
I can't feel it!

06:51.536 --> 06:52.787
I can't feel anything.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.456
You're fine. We're just gonna move you.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.960
All right, on three.
One, two, three, up.

07:02.339 --> 07:03.506
All right, let's go.

07:14.684 --> 07:17.103
Hey, Nathan! What are you doing?

07:18.105 --> 07:21.690
Last year they closed our school's
library to add classrooms.

07:21.817 --> 07:23.859
No one fought back or did anything.

07:23.985 --> 07:27.279
I thought they should have done more.
So this time I'm fighting back.

07:27.405 --> 07:29.448
That's great. How many do you have?

07:29.574 --> 07:31.659
Two. Me and my mom.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.870
- But don't worry, I'll get more.
- Okay.

07:34.996 --> 07:38.290
Hey, you get cold,
come inside, all right?

07:38.416 --> 07:42.086
- I got soup. I'll be fine.
- Okay.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.175
At the home
of Greg Sullivan...

07:48.301 --> 07:51.011
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What's this?

07:51.138 --> 07:53.681
...caught late last night
in a sting operation from the CPD,

07:53.807 --> 07:57.518
where it turns out he's been embezzling
union money to fund a lavish lifestyle

07:57.644 --> 07:59.562
of trips to the Bahamas and jet skis.

07:59.688 --> 08:02.148
I have no comment at this time.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.775
Please leave me and my family alone!

08:07.863 --> 08:10.614
- Can you believe that?
- Wait, so who's in charge?

08:12.450 --> 08:14.660
This is your chance, Mouch.

08:14.786 --> 08:16.871
This is a sign from above.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.081
This is a course correction.

08:19.207 --> 08:22.626
This is a chance to fly up to Phoenix
and spread your wings.

08:22.752 --> 08:25.129
Like a phoenix. Not to Phoenix.

08:25.255 --> 08:29.133
Whatever! The difference
between winners and losers

08:29.259 --> 08:30.801
is not who's the strongest,

08:30.927 --> 08:34.471
but who can recognize
the strongest opportunity.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.606
Yeah. I know. I hear you.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.735
But can we meet? As soon as possible?

08:48.528 --> 08:50.738
Great. I'll be here. Bye.

08:52.949 --> 08:55.242
Arranging a rendezvous
with one of your babes?

08:56.912 --> 08:59.205
- How many do you think I have?
- Well, it better be one.

08:59.331 --> 09:02.374
It is. I'll introduce you
to her sometime. She's hot.

09:04.836 --> 09:08.297
That was your brother.
I'm gonna talk to him about McLeod.

09:08.423 --> 09:10.299
- Dirty pool.
- Mm-hmm.

09:10.425 --> 09:11.425
I love it.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.303
Dangerous.

09:15.430 --> 09:18.307
Well... It's a dangerous job.

09:22.979 --> 09:25.522
Yo, you got something sent
over from headquarters.

09:25.649 --> 09:27.149
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.985
Your shirt's untucked.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.629
Hey, Chief. You wanted to see me?

09:48.755 --> 09:50.673
Yeah, Matt. Um...

09:52.342 --> 09:54.927
McLeod's coming over
later for a walkthrough,

09:55.053 --> 09:57.888
go over some final logistics. And, uh...

09:58.014 --> 10:00.432
Well, I'd like to think I'd take
the high road on this one.

10:00.558 --> 10:01.976
But right now I'm not so sure.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.437
- We'll handle it.
- Okay.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.859
It's my fault.

10:15.407 --> 10:17.283
I let this woman get under my skin.

10:18.493 --> 10:20.286
And I thought I could out-muscle her.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.831
I keep playing it back in my mind.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.960
- If I'd just kept my mouth shut...
- Chief...

10:30.005 --> 10:34.675
The only thing you did was stand up
for the firefighters in your house.

10:35.593 --> 10:39.263
The same thing you've been doing
since you put on those bugles.

10:39.389 --> 10:40.431
This isn't over.

10:45.020 --> 10:46.145
Thank you.

10:59.617 --> 11:02.244
- What do you want, McHolland?
- It doesn't matter.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.372
- He doesn't have a say!
- No, Wyck, that's not true.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.416
I have every right to speak
and I'm going to speak,

11:07.542 --> 11:11.211
and when I'm done, you can then decide
what you want to do. Capisce?

11:12.297 --> 11:17.509
So... Greg Sullivan turned out to be
not such a great idea, huh?

11:17.635 --> 11:23.515
Let's talk about how we, as a union,
are letting the state come in here

11:23.641 --> 11:27.561
and mandate manpower
and worse, close firehouses.

11:28.688 --> 11:32.941
It's time we rise, ladies and gentleman,
like a phoenix.

11:33.068 --> 11:37.780
We're getting run over, and we should be
the ones doing the running!

11:39.449 --> 11:41.116
Over.

11:41.242 --> 11:43.118
Okay, fine.

11:43.244 --> 11:46.705
We've been pulling everything we could
regarding Gail McLeod's mandate.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.791
I was able to access some documentation

11:48.917 --> 11:52.044
as to what authority McLeod
does or doesn't have.

11:52.962 --> 11:53.962
And?

12:05.058 --> 12:06.975
It's not a smoking gun,
but it's something!

12:07.102 --> 12:08.143
What do you got?

12:08.269 --> 12:10.938
McLeod doesn't technically
have to close another house.

12:11.064 --> 12:16.193
But she does receive a bonus of $200,000
if she gets the budget down 10%.

12:16.319 --> 12:18.112
She's doing this to make herself rich.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.990
I bet the Sun-Times would
like to hear that.

12:26.538 --> 12:27.955
What's up?

12:29.124 --> 12:30.124
Um...

12:32.919 --> 12:37.005
When I first applied to be an EMT,
I took the firefighter's test, and...

12:38.258 --> 12:41.135
I'd honestly forgotten about it.
It was, like, six years ago.

12:42.011 --> 12:45.973
- Okay.
- And... today...

12:46.724 --> 12:47.724
I was accepted.

12:49.227 --> 12:50.269
To be a firefighter.

12:51.771 --> 12:55.399
Oh, my God! This is... This is huge!

12:55.525 --> 13:00.195
- Is that what you want?
- I... I don't know. Should it be?

13:00.321 --> 13:01.947
- Yes! Of course!
- Yeah?

13:02.073 --> 13:04.116
I mean, this is your chance
to be a firefighter.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.994
We need women who kick ass
on these trucks, you know?

13:07.120 --> 13:10.330
And, Dawson, if there's anything I know
about you, it's that you kick ass.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.457
Yeah.

13:13.042 --> 13:15.502
- I do, don't I?
- Yeah.

13:16.963 --> 13:21.133
But what about Casey?
I mean, do I ask his opinion?

13:21.259 --> 13:25.220
- Or do I just tell him I'm doing this?
- No, definitely talk to him.

13:25.346 --> 13:28.265
Secrets suck, you know?
And he'll be happy for you.

13:28.391 --> 13:32.394
- Yeah?
- Yeah. This is amazing. Come here.

13:35.523 --> 13:36.565
I got your back.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.151
You're the best.

13:44.199 --> 13:46.074
Okay, keep it going, guys!

13:49.829 --> 13:52.831
Severide. Here for a refresher?

13:52.957 --> 13:54.833
Oh, here we go. Another 20 minutes

13:54.959 --> 13:59.004
about how there hasn't been a real
firefighter in this city since the '70s.

13:59.130 --> 14:00.797
How's the class?

14:00.924 --> 14:02.591
Lumps of clay, but I'll get them molded.

14:02.717 --> 14:05.844
- Hey, I need a favor.
- Yeah.

14:06.971 --> 14:10.474
- You know they're closing 51?
- Yep. It's a load of crap.

14:10.600 --> 14:14.311
So, we're rallying the troops.
I need every warm body we can get.

14:14.437 --> 14:15.854
Anything you want.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.690
As long as you come in next month
to teach a basic training class.

14:20.068 --> 14:22.361
- You need an answer now?
- You want my help now?

14:23.404 --> 14:26.657
- All right, I'm in.
- All right. I'll get on the phone.

14:26.783 --> 14:31.328
All right, you humps, break's over.
Back up the ladders with your gear on!

14:43.007 --> 14:44.675
Hey, that was nice at least.

14:45.510 --> 14:48.595
- She made him that mix CD.
- I made him that mix CD.

14:49.472 --> 14:52.182
I figured he could use the pick-me-up.
What?

14:52.308 --> 14:54.101
Wow.

15:08.449 --> 15:11.285
- How's he doing?
- Says he wants to stay out there.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.912
He's got, like, maybe 10 signatures.

15:18.293 --> 15:22.045
- I heard about Zoya.
- Yeah, I don't want to talk about it.

15:23.506 --> 15:25.340
Great, neither do I.

15:29.053 --> 15:32.889
It's just that I really liked her
and I thought maybe we had a chance.

15:33.016 --> 15:36.226
She would've seen that it wasn't just
'cause she was leaving the country,

15:36.352 --> 15:39.855
but because we had a connection,
a real connection.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.318
We could've grown that into something.

15:46.821 --> 15:47.863
How are you and Lisa doing?

15:50.450 --> 15:53.869
She and I are fine. It's just, uh...

15:55.079 --> 15:57.164
Things are a little messy with her ex.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.550
- Last shift, huh?
- Yeah.

16:11.804 --> 16:15.098
- That's what I wanted to talk about.
- Not about you and my sister?

16:16.934 --> 16:20.771
Don't sweat it. She tells me everything.
And I always liked you.

16:20.897 --> 16:23.065
Tell that to your mother. Please.

16:23.191 --> 16:27.778
Oh, yeah? I will, I will.
But that's not what you called me about.

16:27.904 --> 16:30.155
No. It's this Gail McLeod.

16:30.281 --> 16:32.866
Ah, the thorn in your firehouse's side.

16:32.992 --> 16:37.454
Yeah. Listen, the thing is...
There's got to be something on her.

16:37.580 --> 16:40.957
- Something criminal.
- Okay. Well...

16:42.835 --> 16:44.628
There's two roads you can take here,
Matt.

16:44.754 --> 16:47.172
The high road, I'll look into her. Or...

16:47.298 --> 16:48.924
No. Keep Voight out of this.

16:50.426 --> 16:54.012
Of course. Okay, I'll see what I can do.

16:54.138 --> 16:55.889
All right. Thanks.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.898
Hey, guys,
question for the group.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.859
And for the record, you know,
this is a "safe" room.

17:07.985 --> 17:10.904
Just honest opinions
and no one's gonna be judged.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.364
Oh, just spit it out.

17:12.490 --> 17:15.534
What do you guys think
about female firefighters?

17:15.660 --> 17:17.119
- Honest answer?
- Yep.

17:17.245 --> 17:18.870
I'm fine with it.

17:18.996 --> 17:22.040
Yeah. Everyone says Meg over at 85
is worth three of the men.

17:22.166 --> 17:25.377
Well, I have worked with a woman,
and let me just say,

17:25.503 --> 17:27.587
it wasn't a favorable experience.

17:28.548 --> 17:29.631
It's no secret

17:29.757 --> 17:33.051
that they lowered the standards
of the test to be more "inclusive."

17:33.177 --> 17:35.804
Isn't that right,
Mr. Soon-To-Be Union President?

17:35.930 --> 17:37.973
- Not entirely.
- All right, whatever.

17:38.099 --> 17:43.019
All I know is that this female
firefighter over at Firehouse 17

17:43.146 --> 17:45.856
couldn't physically lift
some debris off her partner,

17:45.982 --> 17:48.024
and they both nearly died.

17:48.151 --> 17:53.029
And it was a nothing house fire.
It comes down to simple physics.

17:53.156 --> 17:55.866
A woman's body is
different than a man's.

17:57.160 --> 18:00.203
What if you need someone
to get into a tighter space?

18:00.329 --> 18:03.582
What if you need someone to crawl
into an area that you can't reach?

18:03.708 --> 18:07.169
I'm content to be with my boys on 81.
No offense.

18:07.295 --> 18:12.007
A female saved your life when
you fell three stories! Remember?

18:12.133 --> 18:14.259
Look, and I'm glad that you were there
as a paramedic,

18:14.385 --> 18:16.970
but I'm also glad you didn't fall
through the floor with me.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.139
- They'da dug both our bodies out.
- Unbelievable.

18:19.265 --> 18:22.642
What? You said this was a safe room!
Why is she biting my head off?

18:22.769 --> 18:24.770
'Cause you have your head stuck up
your...

18:29.025 --> 18:30.817
You know what?

18:30.943 --> 18:33.487
I am gonna chalk this up
to the high tensions of the day.

18:34.697 --> 18:35.697
Fine with me!

18:41.913 --> 18:44.831
So this letter arriving today
was a complete shock.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.208
What happened to med school?

18:48.294 --> 18:51.963
I mean, I'm on year six
of my three-year plan to get in,

18:52.089 --> 18:53.965
and I realize that I am fooling myself.

18:54.091 --> 18:55.675
But this falling into my lap?

18:55.802 --> 18:58.970
I mean, I'm honestly asking,
what should I do?

18:59.096 --> 19:01.640
It feels right to me.
It feels like perfect timing.

19:04.268 --> 19:10.774
My honest opinion is that you tend
to leap before you look sometimes.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.070
- No more than you.
- Fair enough.

19:17.949 --> 19:21.910
All I'm saying is just talk
to some other female firefighters.

19:22.036 --> 19:23.203
Gather some information,

19:23.329 --> 19:25.956
understand better
what you're getting yourself into.

19:26.082 --> 19:27.541
Make an informed decision.

19:31.629 --> 19:34.548
Ambo 61,
man injured from unknown causes,

19:34.674 --> 19:36.258
2119 Kinzie...

19:37.343 --> 19:42.472
That is good advice. Thank you.

19:48.813 --> 19:50.522
He said what?

19:50.648 --> 19:52.357
I don't think he's on board.

20:05.746 --> 20:09.457
- Uh... Did someone call an ambulance?
- Yeah.

20:11.168 --> 20:14.921
Would you... Would you mind
putting some clothes on?

20:15.047 --> 20:16.840
We're not ashamed of our bodies.

20:16.966 --> 20:19.843
It's our friend Jared. He hurt his arm.

20:21.137 --> 20:24.848
Okay. Uh, why don't you guys
lead the way, then?

20:40.323 --> 20:44.993
Ow! Help! Help! Ow! Oh!

20:46.078 --> 20:48.788
We've done this a million times
and it's never broken.

20:48.915 --> 20:52.876
Oh, God, oh! Oh, my God,
please get me down from here, please!

20:58.758 --> 21:01.676
- Well, this is weird.
- Mm-hmm.

21:01.802 --> 21:06.473
Um, how do you usually get him down?

21:06.599 --> 21:08.934
There's a pulley system, but it's broke.

21:09.060 --> 21:11.895
- Yeah, I told her not to tie it so
- tight. You like it tight.

21:12.021 --> 21:15.065
Ow! Ow! I think it cut me!
Oh, God, it cut me!

21:15.191 --> 21:17.484
Okay, all right.

21:17.610 --> 21:21.237
Scott, get your ass over here
and lift him! Please!

21:21.364 --> 21:24.491
Honnie, go to the kitchen
and get me a knife. Now!

21:25.242 --> 21:27.535
Oh, Dawson,
how could you ever want to leave this?

21:32.208 --> 21:36.252
Screw Herrmann. It's not about
what you can or can't carry.

21:36.379 --> 21:39.214
You didn't panic, and you ordered
someone else to do the lifting for you.

21:39.340 --> 21:41.216
Not too many people
would've thought to do that.

21:43.302 --> 21:46.179
You'd make a great firefighter.
End of story.

21:49.725 --> 21:52.435
- Hey, Otis, so, um, I was thinking.
- Oh, yeah?

21:52.561 --> 21:55.271
Yeah. With you having to move in
with your mom,

21:55.398 --> 21:57.107
and Leon having moved out on me,

21:57.233 --> 22:00.318
what if we were to, um,
find a place together?

22:02.405 --> 22:04.406
- Really?
- Yeah!

22:04.532 --> 22:07.617
I mean, look, I know we won't
be as cool as "Shayveride,"

22:07.743 --> 22:13.707
but if you think about it,
"Crotis" could be epic.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.792
- Does have a nifty ring to it.
- I know!

22:15.918 --> 22:18.545
And we've never really had a chance
to come into our own.

22:18.671 --> 22:21.131
- You know what? Let's do it!
- Yeah?

22:21.257 --> 22:22.590
Absolutely.

22:29.682 --> 22:32.684
- How's it going, Nathan?
- Slow.

22:33.894 --> 22:37.313
I think I need a bigger sign,
or a way to get people's attention.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.190
How about some hot chocolate instead?

22:42.069 --> 22:45.739
What you're doing, it means a lot to us.
So thank you.

22:51.746 --> 22:55.373
Who decides this kind of stuff, anyways?
Politicians?

22:57.710 --> 23:00.962
I guess so. Yeah.

23:11.807 --> 23:13.641
Hey, Antonio, what's up?

23:13.768 --> 23:15.769
- Hey, fellas.
- Tell me you got something.

23:15.895 --> 23:18.271
McLeod stole a pack of gum
when she was 14.

23:18.397 --> 23:22.317
- Otherwise, not even a speeding ticket.
- She probably paid them off.

23:22.443 --> 23:24.486
- Hey, is Jeff Clarke around?
- That's me.

23:24.612 --> 23:27.739
Mind if I talk to you for a minute?
Severide, you too.

23:33.037 --> 23:36.164
I have to ask if you saw Brian Hayes
last night at Molly's.

23:36.290 --> 23:38.833
- I did.
- What's up?

23:38.959 --> 23:41.920
His friends said you threatened him.
Said you wanted to kill him.

23:46.008 --> 23:48.593
- It was an argument.
- You seen him since?

23:48.719 --> 23:52.097
No. I went home to bed
and I've been here all day.

23:52.223 --> 23:54.724
- Why?
- He's dead.

24:04.610 --> 24:07.570
Hey, this Hayes guy came busting in
and called Clarke's wife a whore

24:07.696 --> 24:10.031
and then he was going on and on
about some money.

24:10.157 --> 24:13.201
Hey, I get it.
But these guys have a history.

24:13.327 --> 24:15.745
- Are you going to arrest him?
- Not yet.

24:16.956 --> 24:19.457
I'll do what I can on my end
to make this as fair as possible,

24:19.583 --> 24:20.875
but I'm not making any promises.

24:21.001 --> 24:23.211
Hey, does he need a lawyer?

24:24.338 --> 24:25.463
Not if he's innocent.

24:29.468 --> 24:34.139
You and your wife are a priority, Jeff,
so whatever you need.

24:34.265 --> 24:35.557
I didn't do it, Chief.

24:36.517 --> 24:39.269
Didn't need to be said.
But I appreciate that.

24:41.105 --> 24:42.981
Chief, Ms. McLeod is here.

24:51.115 --> 24:52.157
Come on.

24:55.119 --> 25:00.331
Really, Chief, there is something
to be said for a gracious exit.

25:00.457 --> 25:03.877
- The state is not happy with you.
- What are you talking about?

25:05.796 --> 25:08.423
Okay, fine.

25:08.549 --> 25:10.508
Let's play it your way.

25:10.634 --> 25:14.345
Your little stunt notwithstanding,
as soon as this shift is over,

25:14.471 --> 25:18.933
inspectors will be here to make sure
that all of your employees exit timely.

25:19.059 --> 25:22.937
Not a jacket, not a pen,
not a souvenir is to leave this house.

25:23.063 --> 25:25.273
Do I make myself clear?

25:25.399 --> 25:28.276
Tell me, was closing firehouses
a dream of yours when you were a kid?

25:28.402 --> 25:30.570
Oh, it was at the top of my bucket list.

25:30.696 --> 25:33.072
Along with $200,000?

25:35.618 --> 25:36.618
Excuse me?

25:44.251 --> 25:45.251
Oh...

25:47.171 --> 25:48.963
Hey, guys. You gotta see this.

25:54.053 --> 25:58.264
Save 51! Save 51!

26:00.851 --> 26:03.519
Save 51! Save 51!

26:12.279 --> 26:15.281
Save 51! Save 51!

26:44.353 --> 26:49.524
Chief! Chief! Your presence
is being requested.

26:49.650 --> 26:51.317
And yours too, Ms. McLeod!

26:54.822 --> 26:56.239
Thank you!

27:16.051 --> 27:17.760
- He'll see you now.
- Thank you.

27:23.392 --> 27:27.020
You have my word. Thank you, sir.

27:30.607 --> 27:33.192
Ms. McLeod... I'm Quenton Wheeler.

27:33.319 --> 27:36.070
Yes, of course.
I know who you are, Senator.

27:36.196 --> 27:38.573
How's the national office campaign?
It must be so...

27:38.699 --> 27:41.034
- How many calls have we had?
- Nearly a thousand.

27:42.661 --> 27:46.956
Local politician works
to save a local firehouse.

27:47.082 --> 27:50.460
- Who doesn't love that story?
- Well, I don't... I don't know...

27:50.586 --> 27:53.463
Isabella here is going to handle
all the details.

27:53.589 --> 27:55.089
- It was great meeting you.
- Oh!

27:59.595 --> 28:01.012
- Ms. McLeod?
- Yes?

28:01.138 --> 28:04.682
On this table here is a piece of paper
awaiting your signature.

28:04.808 --> 28:07.018
Since it has been brought
to the Senator's attention

28:07.144 --> 28:09.228
you don't have a mandate
to close any more firehouses,

28:09.355 --> 28:10.605
we'd like you to sign it.

28:13.192 --> 28:15.568
- I don't think you understand...
- I understand this.

28:15.694 --> 28:19.197
You may be able to bully your way
around the State Fire Marshal's office,

28:19.323 --> 28:22.367
but you're swimming
in different waters now, Gail.

28:22.493 --> 28:23.826
You're gonna sign that paper

28:23.952 --> 28:26.412
or you're gonna have
microphones stuck in your face

28:26.538 --> 28:30.875
asking why your salary is a big chunk
of the money you saved the city.

28:37.633 --> 28:38.883
If you would just stop...

28:39.009 --> 28:41.135
If you don't sign it,
I will nail you to a cross so hard

28:41.261 --> 28:43.262
you won't get a government contract
as a meter maid.

29:08.497 --> 29:09.789
You missed one.

29:29.560 --> 29:31.602
And don't come back, Gail.

29:35.190 --> 29:36.607
- Phew!
- Sushi tonight?

29:36.733 --> 29:39.902
- Oh, yes, we're gonna order in.
- Mmm. Perfect.

29:40.821 --> 29:42.447
See you, Chief.

29:42.573 --> 29:44.282
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.334
You did a great thing today, Peter.

29:56.879 --> 30:01.340
No, Chief. This was all because of you.

30:23.405 --> 30:26.365
Ding, dong, the witch is dead!

30:31.747 --> 30:34.916
No, no. It's not me.

30:36.335 --> 30:39.879
It's Nathan. It's all you guys showing
Isabella what this house was all about.

30:40.005 --> 30:41.172
Hear, hear.

30:45.385 --> 30:47.428
Guys, guys...

30:47.554 --> 30:51.432
On that happy note, uh,
Dawson has an announcement to make.

30:53.310 --> 30:54.393
I do?

30:55.395 --> 30:58.356
Hey! You do.

31:01.652 --> 31:04.195
Um, today...

31:04.321 --> 31:08.032
I found out that I was officially
accepted into the Fire Academy

31:08.158 --> 31:10.243
to become a firefighter.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.169
You'll make a great firefighter, Dawson!

31:20.295 --> 31:21.629
That's great! Good!

31:33.183 --> 31:35.851
What happened to taking
some time to think about it?

31:35.978 --> 31:38.688
- You don't support me on this?
- No, I do, I do.

31:38.814 --> 31:41.315
I just thought, as I suggested,

31:41.441 --> 31:45.194
you'd talk to some other people
and consider all your options.

31:45.320 --> 31:47.863
- Well, this is happening.
- I can see that.

31:51.326 --> 31:55.413
Truck 81,
Squad 3, Ambulance 61, Battalion 25.

31:55.539 --> 31:58.624
Apartment fire, 5021 Quincy.

32:13.265 --> 32:17.310
Cruz, Herrmann, Mills, with me.
Primary search on the top floor.

32:17.436 --> 32:20.563
I'm counting one, two, three, four...
Sixteen apartments.

32:20.689 --> 32:23.899
Mouch, check the rear. Otis, stand by.
We're taking the top floor.

32:24.026 --> 32:28.321
We'll start right below you. 51,
cover us. Two lines in the front door.

32:28.447 --> 32:29.822
We're on it!

32:34.703 --> 32:36.412
How we looking in there?

32:36.538 --> 32:37.788
It's rolling, Chief!

32:41.335 --> 32:42.918
Fire Department, call out!

32:45.964 --> 32:49.967
- Damn, this is an oven!
- Search quickly, guys!

32:52.804 --> 32:56.474
Fire Department, call out!
Anyone here?

32:56.600 --> 32:59.352
- Help! In here!
- I got one!

32:59.478 --> 33:01.854
Engine 51, it looks like we're losing.

33:01.980 --> 33:05.191
Hold it back a little longer
till we clear the building.

33:05.317 --> 33:08.027
Then we're gonna back out
and go defensive.

33:08.153 --> 33:09.612
Watch those stairs!

33:12.616 --> 33:16.494
- Herrmann, stay with me.
- Counting on it!

33:17.954 --> 33:19.413
Truck 81, I need an update!

33:19.539 --> 33:21.957
Chief, we're halfway
through the fourth floor!

33:22.084 --> 33:23.417
Still more to search.

33:26.546 --> 33:29.840
Hey! I've got victims in here!

33:29.966 --> 33:32.051
We need a ladder
on the northwest window.

33:33.178 --> 33:34.887
Hey, come on, guys,
we'll get you out of here.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.765
You're okay. You're okay.
We'll get you out.

33:39.685 --> 33:42.061
Hey, you two, follow me,
we need some help.

33:42.187 --> 33:46.148
Otis! You go to the front.

33:47.651 --> 33:48.984
Ready? Go!

33:50.570 --> 33:53.572
You're okay. You're okay.
Come on, come on.

33:58.870 --> 34:02.039
- Here! Right here!
- Lower it down. Down.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.668
It's gonna collapse! Better go!

34:07.337 --> 34:09.964
Nice and slow. I got you!

34:17.180 --> 34:19.515
Steady, ma'am. You're okay.

34:23.019 --> 34:26.814
Damn it. That smoke is turning black.

34:26.940 --> 34:29.734
Casey, you got one minute. I mean it!

34:30.652 --> 34:32.611
A couple more rooms, Chief.

34:35.240 --> 34:37.366
We're on three, coming out.

34:44.374 --> 34:46.667
All right, I'm calling it.
Evacuate the building.

34:46.793 --> 34:48.836
Evacuate the building right now!

34:48.962 --> 34:51.297
Copy. On our way.

34:54.760 --> 34:59.346
My baby! Please! My baby!
Please help me!

34:59.473 --> 35:01.724
Herrmann! Herrmann.

35:02.642 --> 35:05.060
Help me, please! My baby!
Please help me!

35:05.187 --> 35:08.689
My baby, she's in her crib,
she's in the back bedroom...

35:08.815 --> 35:11.734
Take her. Get her out of here.
I'm going after the baby!

35:11.860 --> 35:14.612
No, Casey, you take her!
I'll get the kid!

35:14.738 --> 35:18.282
Herrmann! You have a family!
I'll get the baby!

35:18.408 --> 35:19.950
That's an order!

35:20.076 --> 35:21.952
Lieutenant, no!

35:22.078 --> 35:23.078
Casey!

35:24.706 --> 35:26.749
Come on, ma'am! Please! Let's go!

35:35.801 --> 35:38.928
Hold on, sweetie, hold on!

36:14.172 --> 36:16.006
Casey, I need an update!

36:18.051 --> 36:19.468
Almost there!

36:26.643 --> 36:28.394
Come on. Come on.

36:43.785 --> 36:48.330
Structural collapse! Mayday!
Help Casey! Help Casey!

36:48.456 --> 36:51.375
Copy.
Structural collapse, firefighter down.

36:55.088 --> 36:58.632
Casey! Hold on! Casey!

37:01.136 --> 37:02.219
Call out!

37:04.222 --> 37:07.308
Casey, we got you! Come on! Come on!

37:10.520 --> 37:12.354
Again, come on! Pull harder!

37:14.232 --> 37:16.567
Get him! Get him! Pull him out!

37:18.778 --> 37:21.989
- We got you, Casey!
- Okay, here we go, here we go!

37:34.252 --> 37:35.502
Oh, God!

37:38.798 --> 37:40.132
I got her!

37:45.889 --> 37:49.058
- Casey!
- Get it off.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.312
We're clear!

37:54.731 --> 37:56.941
Come on, buddy.
Come on, buddy. Come on, buddy.

37:57.067 --> 37:59.193
One, two, three, go!

38:04.950 --> 38:06.700
All right, let's go!

38:23.051 --> 38:24.259
Come on!

38:26.763 --> 38:28.347
Damn it, Matt, come on!

38:30.266 --> 38:33.644
Come on. Come on, Matt, not like this!

38:36.231 --> 38:37.731
Come on.

38:42.654 --> 38:43.654
Come on.

39:09.848 --> 39:11.348
I'm a firefighter.

39:16.396 --> 39:17.896
I just wanna let you guys all know that.

39:18.023 --> 39:21.442
That I'm a firefighter,
and I will always be a firefighter.

39:29.367 --> 39:33.620
Hey, guys, the baby is doing fine,
and is out of intensive care.

39:39.836 --> 39:41.378
Gabby...

39:43.548 --> 39:46.508
- I heard. What do you know?
- Head trauma is all.

39:48.094 --> 39:49.553
Be strong.

39:59.731 --> 40:02.941
The two rounds in Hayes' chest
are from a.45-caliber,

40:03.068 --> 40:04.693
Marine standard-issued sidearm.

40:05.945 --> 40:09.448
Jeff, if we search your house,
we gonna find a gun like that?

40:14.037 --> 40:15.746
You have to come with me.

40:24.839 --> 40:27.966
He has an epidural hematoma
and is in emergency surgery.

40:28.093 --> 40:29.885
But that's all I can say.

40:30.011 --> 40:32.387
Just be patient. It might be a while.

40:33.598 --> 40:35.057
Gabriela...
