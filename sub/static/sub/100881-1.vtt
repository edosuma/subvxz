WEBVTT

02:05.542 --> 02:06.667
Lillian.

02:07.834 --> 02:08.875
Yes ?

02:18.084 --> 02:21.750
- You've never done adult films ?
- No.

02:33.667 --> 02:35.542
Your visa has expired.

02:36.167 --> 02:38.501
You came here one year ago.

02:38.917 --> 02:41.334
You've overstayed by six months.

02:44.417 --> 02:46.292
I can't hire you.

02:47.042 --> 02:49.167
Things are very strict now.

02:49.792 --> 02:53.084
I can't just hire people
from the street.

02:53.667 --> 02:55.876
I need personal documents.

02:56.792 --> 02:59.834
A social security card,
medical certificates.

03:00.542 --> 03:02.167
You have nothing.

03:02.542 --> 03:04.751
The photos are okay,

03:05.001 --> 03:07.834
but they are for a model agency.

03:08.251 --> 03:10.751
We do hardcore porn films here.

03:12.209 --> 03:14.459
And you don't speak English ?

03:19.834 --> 03:21.876
That's another problem.

03:27.667 --> 03:29.709
I don't know about you.

03:33.668 --> 03:36.043
If I were you,
I'd go back to Russia.

03:40.584 --> 03:42.543
Lots of stuff going on there.

03:43.543 --> 03:45.001
There's money.

03:46.584 --> 03:50.043
Russia is the land
of great opportunity.

04:44.335 --> 04:50.710
LILLIAN

15:07.713 --> 15:12.047
You know, the actual space that
you can build on is pretty limited.

15:13.672 --> 15:16.338
I'm not sure what's gonna happen
with the town.

15:16.963 --> 15:19.172
What changes can be made.

15:20.088 --> 15:23.005
We didn't really get impacted
by hurricane...

15:24.255 --> 15:28.588
Irene, but then, the following week in
this area, we had tropical storm Lee.

15:28.797 --> 15:32.172
The building here took on
4 1/2 feet of water.

15:32.922 --> 15:36.297
I knew it was gonna flood here
at the restaurant at that point.

15:37.547 --> 15:40.630
You know, it was really difficult
after the flood.

15:40.880 --> 15:43.880
We were under water
for three days here.

15:44.422 --> 15:47.422
It was heartbreaking
for a lot of people.

15:47.547 --> 15:50.297
They lost everything:
photo albums, you know.

15:52.047 --> 15:54.005
We lost so many people in the town.

15:54.422 --> 15:58.130
It's not like they could have stayed
on. It wasn't a gradual thing.

15:58.213 --> 16:01.630
All of a sudden you just lost...
Half the town had gone.

16:04.339 --> 16:08.214
We started out as a family restaurant,
open seven days a week and...

16:08.505 --> 16:12.714
We got up and running
on our own and...

16:13.589 --> 16:15.339
felt pretty good about it.

16:15.589 --> 16:18.339
I think the restaurant looked nicer
than before.

16:18.464 --> 16:21.755
You know, the inside and everything,
all brand-new equipment.

16:21.880 --> 16:24.172
I mean that was...
that was really good.

16:24.339 --> 16:27.964
But that really didn't work
so swell for us.

16:29.005 --> 16:33.005
Too many people gone from the town,
so there wasn't much you could do.

16:33.839 --> 16:36.839
We're doing what we're doing now,
with the flea market.

16:39.797 --> 16:43.380
There aren't resources out there
for people, that's the problem.

16:44.422 --> 16:47.047
We can rebuild the banks
and the car industry.

16:47.297 --> 16:49.964
I only would have needed
maybe forty grand.

16:51.922 --> 16:53.422
The property is up for sale.

16:53.547 --> 16:56.589
I'm hoping somebody
will eventually come and buy it.

16:57.047 --> 16:59.297
I think people are just discouraged.

17:03.756 --> 17:05.839
I don't know,
the young people just...

17:06.797 --> 17:08.756
They don't seem to stay.

17:44.381 --> 17:45.922
Racers get ready !

17:47.506 --> 17:49.256
Start your engines !

18:52.798 --> 18:55.090
You came in second.
Great race !

20:38.757 --> 20:40.673
This is KWYR News.

20:40.798 --> 20:42.257
Good morning, everybody.

20:42.382 --> 20:45.923
Schramm and Doski here
with better weather ahead.

20:46.007 --> 20:49.840
Nights are still cold,
but temps rising during the day.

20:50.174 --> 20:53.757
Yeah, it's great news.
We can kiss this long winter goodbye.

20:53.965 --> 20:57.715
What a crazy winter it was !
Snow storms into mid-March.

20:57.840 --> 21:00.715
But the good news is,
we made it into the spring.

21:00.840 --> 21:04.090
The days are getting longer.
Nice to see the sunshine.

21:04.174 --> 21:09.424
Right now it looks like the weekend
will be dry and fairly mild.

21:09.840 --> 21:13.507
Get that lawnmower out and give
your lawn the first trim of the year.

21:13.590 --> 21:14.965
Or how about a yard sale ?

21:15.049 --> 21:19.424
Yeah, we start thinking
about yard sales, with warmer weather.

21:19.549 --> 21:23.049
Get out the old clothes and furniture.
Have a yard sale.

21:23.132 --> 21:25.507
Give us a call,
we'll put it on our Mailbag.

21:25.590 --> 21:28.549
Yes, there is a yard sale
on 5th Street.

21:28.674 --> 21:31.674
Lots of clothes, furniture,
toys, knick-knacks...

21:31.799 --> 21:33.090
All the good stuff.

21:33.174 --> 21:36.799
The forecast next week
looks really good, too.

21:37.215 --> 21:41.632
I think we can say,
maybe we are into spring

21:42.549 --> 21:44.132
for sure.

21:51.674 --> 21:53.132
Stunning.

21:53.674 --> 21:55.341
Let me see.

21:55.799 --> 21:59.674
Look at it. See ? That's why I wasn't
liking it. It just wasn't doing...

22:00.132 --> 22:03.049
I have a stunning red necklace
to go with that.

22:03.382 --> 22:05.341
Sorry !
You're not getting it back !

22:06.299 --> 22:09.424
Then you have to bring me
two more things in your closet.

22:09.549 --> 22:10.841
When did you get these ?

22:11.674 --> 22:13.716
They've been here,
I was hiding them from you.

22:13.799 --> 22:16.716
I'm your best customer,
and you're hiding merchandise from me ?

22:16.841 --> 22:19.174
You get first dibs on everything.

22:20.049 --> 22:23.507
It's a good thing you and Linda
are not the same size.

22:23.966 --> 22:26.591
There'd be a war every time
you come in over stuff.

22:30.132 --> 22:33.507
You're my idol, Sheila.
You do it better than anybody else.

22:34.174 --> 22:37.174
Fabulous.
Absolutely fabulous !

22:38.216 --> 22:41.341
This is the new stuff that came in
that I didn't look at yet.

22:41.633 --> 22:43.633
- Oh, it's a cold shoulder.
- Yes.

22:47.424 --> 22:49.466
- Beautiful.
- This is stunning.

22:52.133 --> 22:53.674
- I guess...
- Where'd she go ?

28:22.301 --> 28:24.218
Eighteen to eleven last night.

28:24.509 --> 28:28.010
They missed a late field goal
for the go-ahead points.

28:28.135 --> 28:31.635
But Marcus Sherels picked them up.
Vikings are two ahead.

28:31.885 --> 28:34.135
- Both road games.
- Yeah, they were.

28:34.260 --> 28:37.468
So, they're gonna play their first home
game next week some time.

28:37.551 --> 28:40.051
Next week some time,
in a brand new stadium.

29:00.176 --> 29:03.343
I wish that some of our area teams
got more recognition.

29:35.427 --> 29:38.052
They mentioned them
being the favorite, but...

29:42.552 --> 29:45.885
- That's why you got us, folks !
- That's why you got us.

29:46.177 --> 29:49.343
We'll talk about our teams
all season long, Christopher.

29:49.468 --> 29:51.802
I'm like: "Where's Gregory ?
Where's all these teams ?"

29:52.802 --> 29:53.843
Thank you.

29:54.218 --> 29:56.135
- We get it !
- We understand it.

29:56.468 --> 29:59.927
They brought it up and I'm like:
"Come on ! Let's not be biased."

30:00.093 --> 30:01.927
It's been going on for years.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.885
Should we talk about sale day today
at the livestock auction ?

30:06.968 --> 30:08.177
When do they start ?

30:08.260 --> 30:10.927
They get going at 9 o'clock
with weigh-ups.

30:12.427 --> 30:14.677
- Twins lost last night.
- Twins fell ?

30:14.802 --> 30:17.885
- Eight to one.
- Whatever. That's okay.

30:18.927 --> 30:22.302
- Busy weekend of golf.
- My goodness, it's gotta shape up.

30:22.427 --> 30:27.427
Today some courses might be
a little under water, possibly,

30:28.010 --> 30:30.760
I'm afraid to say.
But that's okay.

30:54.302 --> 30:56.385
Jim, I have one walk-on.

31:02.344 --> 31:03.719
Sounds good.

34:06.095 --> 34:09.178
So we welcome in Doski.
And I tell you what, Chris...

34:09.553 --> 34:14.094
I don't know if we need to give away
a car wash or something.

34:14.303 --> 34:15.762
We gotta make it rain.

34:15.928 --> 34:18.844
It's hot again today,
according to the forecast.

34:18.969 --> 34:22.844
Whatever it takes. We're above
triple digits again here today,

34:22.969 --> 34:24.887
and for the foreseeable future.

34:25.012 --> 34:28.844
It always seems like it's a marathon
between rains out here.

34:28.969 --> 34:31.803
It's miserable to be outside
for a couple of minutes.

34:31.887 --> 34:34.719
Certainly, when the humidity
gets there. But I tell you what.

34:35.344 --> 34:37.512
We could use a rain one of these days.

34:37.637 --> 34:40.553
I'm not sure
when we're gonna get some relief,

34:40.844 --> 34:43.512
maybe in the 10-day forecast,

34:43.637 --> 34:47.219
maybe a little relief in sight,
I don't know. Triple digits !

34:47.469 --> 34:51.137
We'll talk plenty of pattern
in the heartland weather forecast

34:51.262 --> 34:54.344
coming up at 7:35.
And even the lows...

34:55.594 --> 34:58.220
I mean, the lows are in the low 70s.

34:58.345 --> 35:01.678
It's bordering on ridiculous
but it's typical, Doski.

35:01.803 --> 35:03.387
It's like you always tell me.

35:03.512 --> 35:07.053
It's one thing to be warm,
but the humidity makes it unbearable.

36:15.971 --> 36:19.554
You know, it is great...
It is great to be born into a country

36:19.679 --> 36:22.804
where we have that opportunity
to do what we just did.

36:23.012 --> 36:25.262
Please listen to me right now.

36:25.679 --> 36:28.262
We start a family, we work a job.

36:29.012 --> 36:31.762
It seems like we live life in a hurry,

36:32.012 --> 36:35.304
to see how much we can get done,
how much money we can make.

36:35.387 --> 36:38.304
There's nothing wrong with that.
We want to provide

36:38.429 --> 36:41.804
for our friends and our family.
We want the best we can have.

36:42.304 --> 36:45.304
But I promise you, no matter
what material things you got,

36:45.637 --> 36:49.679
no matter how much money you make,
you've already got the best of the best

36:50.429 --> 36:53.846
Because you and I have a lot in common
and you don't even know me.

36:53.929 --> 36:56.846
I'm just like you,
I've been blessed by God

36:57.887 --> 37:01.471
to be born into a country
where we have the chance, the freedom,

37:01.554 --> 37:05.221
and the opportunity to do every day
what we choose of our lives.

37:05.763 --> 37:09.596
We make of our day, today,
just like we do tomorrow.

37:10.304 --> 37:11.971
It's our choice.

37:12.054 --> 37:16.096
My dream is made possible by the men
and women I want to introduce.

37:16.471 --> 37:20.013
If we've got any veterans, if you have
served the United States of America,

37:20.096 --> 37:22.471
do me a favor tonight.
If you've been in Iraq,

37:22.554 --> 37:24.596
Afghanistan,
Vietnam or World War...

37:24.679 --> 37:26.763
we don't care where,
we don't care why.

37:26.846 --> 37:30.721
If you have served the United States,
please stand up and remain standing.

37:30.846 --> 37:33.721
Give us an opportunity
on our Independence weekend

37:33.804 --> 37:36.888
to look a true American hero
in the eye.

37:37.471 --> 37:40.971
Ladies and gentlemen, look around you.
The men and women that are standing

37:41.054 --> 37:43.888
in your very midst
are the freedom fighters

37:43.971 --> 37:46.471
of the United States of America.

37:46.804 --> 37:49.679
Now do me a favor
and stand up with them

37:49.763 --> 37:52.513
and give them
the recognition they deserve.

37:52.596 --> 37:55.054
Tell 'em: "God bless the USA !"

41:36.139 --> 41:37.597
C'mon, Bessy !

41:48.806 --> 41:50.514
Hey, wait !

42:00.056 --> 42:01.514
Hi, sugar.

42:02.431 --> 42:05.514
Do you know how I can get to...
it's called Squirrel Lane ?

42:06.348 --> 42:09.056
This is Badger Road,
it makes sense they're connected.

42:09.139 --> 42:12.598
I'm going crazy out here,
all this stuff looks the same to me.

42:12.973 --> 42:15.056
And I'm not...

42:15.473 --> 42:17.723
You're not from around here,
are you ?

42:18.139 --> 42:19.639
Excuse me.

42:21.639 --> 42:24.431
Okay, whatever.
Have a good one.

43:23.223 --> 43:24.848
Hey, sugar, it's me again.

43:25.390 --> 43:28.431
Wait, wait ! It's hot, it's hot.
You want a soda pop ?

43:29.306 --> 43:31.598
Soda pop, yummy yummy !
C'mon !

43:37.306 --> 43:38.890
Oh, really ?

43:39.848 --> 43:42.973
This is Badger Road
and you know about badgers, right ?

43:43.098 --> 43:45.181
They're mean little animals.

43:46.057 --> 43:50.140
You try to kill a badger with a shovel,
you wind up with a shovel up your ass.

43:54.932 --> 43:56.557
Are you deaf ?

43:56.932 --> 43:58.723
Mother !

44:01.015 --> 44:02.807
Fuck !

45:19.474 --> 45:20.849
Sugar ?

45:25.640 --> 45:27.015
Sugar !

48:48.350 --> 48:51.767
Hi, everybody, I'm Jim Thompson.
Someone asked the other day:

48:51.850 --> 48:55.100
"What was your favorite fast food
when you were growing up ?"

48:55.183 --> 48:57.475
"We didn't have fast food
when I was growing up,"

48:57.558 --> 49:00.308
I informed him.
"All the food was slow."

49:00.475 --> 49:02.267
"Come on ! Where did you eat ?"

49:02.392 --> 49:05.392
"There was a place called at home,"
I explained.

49:05.475 --> 49:08.017
Mom cooked every day.
When Dad got home from work,

49:08.100 --> 49:10.475
we sat down together,
at the dining room table.

49:10.600 --> 49:13.017
If I didn't like
what she put on my plate,

49:13.100 --> 49:15.558
I was allowed to sit there
until I did like it.

49:15.683 --> 49:18.433
Pizzas were not delivered
to our home, but milk was.

49:18.600 --> 49:22.517
All newspapers were delivered by boys
and all boys delivered newspapers.

49:23.392 --> 49:25.892
We didn't have a television
in our house until I was 19.

49:25.975 --> 49:27.558
It was of course black and white.

49:27.642 --> 49:29.600
The station went off the air
at midnight

49:29.725 --> 49:32.934
after playing the national anthem
and a poem about God.

49:33.267 --> 49:36.684
Movie stars kissed with their
mouths shut, at least in the movies.

49:36.809 --> 49:38.809
There were no movie ratings, because

49:38.892 --> 49:42.767
all movies were responsibly produced
for everyone to enjoy viewing.

49:42.892 --> 49:46.642
Growing up isn't quite
what it used to be, is it ?

49:59.767 --> 50:04.184
Get your umbrella ready, folks,
it's gonna get wet around here.

50:04.309 --> 50:07.267
And we may even see
a little or a lotta hail too.

50:07.350 --> 50:09.725
Our forecast calls for highs
in the mid 80s,

50:09.809 --> 50:12.767
lows in the mid 60s tonight.
Tomorrow, highs in the 70s.

50:12.892 --> 50:16.017
Yeah, looks like we finally get
some long-awaited rain,

50:16.100 --> 50:20.184
scattered showers across the mid-west,
chances of isolated thunderstorms.

50:20.475 --> 50:23.225
Now some of these could get nasty
with a whole bunch of rain.

50:23.309 --> 50:24.767
Even hail in some parts.

50:24.850 --> 50:28.601
Have your mobile phones with you.
There might be flash flood warnings.

50:28.684 --> 50:30.309
You know what they say...

50:30.392 --> 50:33.226
Wait five minutes
and things could change.

50:33.309 --> 50:35.892
And that's what we're gonna see
around here.

50:36.017 --> 50:40.434
Not just today,
but for many days and nights to come.

53:13.143 --> 53:17.643
Okay ! It's gonna be about 15 minutes
till Final Derby time.

53:17.976 --> 53:20.435
We're gonna have
six cars in the finals.

53:20.768 --> 53:22.893
We're not gonna have
a Consolation Derby

53:23.018 --> 53:26.227
because too many people
cannot get their cars running.

53:26.435 --> 53:30.143
So your people in the finals
are gonna be Ben Booth,

53:30.393 --> 53:32.602
Derek Ford,
Jeff Kraft...

53:34.143 --> 53:36.560
and I'm not sure
who the other two are.

53:37.810 --> 53:41.435
Not Ron Winterberg.
He can't get his car fixed.

53:43.727 --> 53:46.143
Are the firemen ready ?

53:47.852 --> 53:50.560
On the count of three: one,

53:51.143 --> 53:53.893
two, three, rumble !

55:43.269 --> 55:46.061
There you have your 2016 winner !

55:52.061 --> 55:54.977
And the second place:
Chance Jenson from Lentry.

55:56.519 --> 55:59.727
And in third place:
Janner Elder from Winner.

56:02.144 --> 56:05.352
Okay, tonight there's a dance down
in front of the tent,

56:05.436 --> 56:09.311
A dance here tomorrow night, rodeo
tomorrow night, rodeo Sunday night...

56:09.477 --> 56:10.769
So there you go !

56:10.936 --> 56:13.811
By the way,
happy birthday to Brandon Updike.

56:14.769 --> 56:18.561
From your family on your 18th birthday.
Brandon, happy birthday !

58:32.353 --> 58:34.853
O'Neill. 9631 ?

58:38.478 --> 58:40.103
Go ahead, O'Neill.

58:40.562 --> 58:43.728
I have a report
of a walker on Highway 12,

58:44.312 --> 58:46.187
westbound from Monowi.

58:46.603 --> 58:49.187
A walker, Highway 12,
westbound from Monowi.

58:49.937 --> 58:51.812
10-4, I'll handle it.

58:53.562 --> 58:55.062
10-4.

59:22.312 --> 59:24.145
Let us go amongst them.

01:00:30.979 --> 01:00:33.437
Hi.
Do you have some form of ID ?

01:00:34.854 --> 01:00:37.937
Something with your name on it ?
Step over here, please ?

01:00:41.771 --> 01:00:44.104
Could you take your bag
and lay it there for me ?

01:00:49.271 --> 01:00:51.729
Good.
Put your hands just like that.

01:01:16.063 --> 01:01:18.479
Do you think you need
a weapon like this ?

01:01:25.521 --> 01:01:27.604
Can you turn and face me ?

01:01:27.938 --> 01:01:30.438
Turn and face me.
I'm going to take your picture.

01:01:37.813 --> 01:01:40.438
Could you put your hands
back here for me ?

01:01:47.604 --> 01:01:50.354
9631. O'Neill ?

01:01:51.396 --> 01:01:55.729
Request 10-29 photo ID.
Can you see just ? 10-29 ?

01:02:12.688 --> 01:02:16.396
10-4, 9631,
subject is not 10-29.

01:02:17.855 --> 01:02:19.813
10-4, O'Neill.
Thank you.

01:02:23.938 --> 01:02:27.605
- 963. O'Neill ?
- Go ahead, 9631.

01:02:29.355 --> 01:02:33.480
I'm en route to Keya Paha
County border. 1-10-12.

01:02:33.646 --> 01:02:35.771
Caucasian, 20 years old, female.

01:02:36.396 --> 01:02:41.021
Starting mileage: 19,961.

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:45.605
10-4, 9631.
19:52.

01:02:47.855 --> 01:02:50.938
You know, it's really not safe for you
to be out like this.

01:02:51.188 --> 01:02:52.813
There's bad people out here

01:02:53.230 --> 01:02:56.105
and you're miles and miles
from nowhere.

01:02:56.522 --> 01:03:00.230
There's wild animals, there's people
that aren't safe drivers

01:03:00.563 --> 01:03:03.105
and you're a long way
from anywhere.

01:03:03.563 --> 01:03:07.022
And the further west you go,
the more dangerous it gets.

01:03:08.355 --> 01:03:11.897
What I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna
take you on to the county border.

01:03:12.647 --> 01:03:15.105
That's where
I'm gonna drop you off at.

01:03:15.855 --> 01:03:18.063
There's nothing else
I can do for you.

01:03:41.688 --> 01:03:43.063
Wait !

01:03:52.522 --> 01:03:55.397
You're gonna need this.
It gets cold out here at night.

01:04:42.939 --> 01:04:46.397
I knew Jack a long time
and he'd got a helluva temper.

01:04:46.522 --> 01:04:49.064
But still,
to shoot yourself over a woman ?

01:04:49.147 --> 01:04:51.689
That's the stupidest thing you could...

01:04:52.689 --> 01:04:55.897
I've always felt bad about that too.
I loaded the ammo.

01:04:56.897 --> 01:04:58.856
For him, when he...

01:05:00.231 --> 01:05:01.856
That was a sad story.

01:05:01.981 --> 01:05:07.439
It's the biggest problem sometimes.
Guys get crazy over women and...

01:05:08.064 --> 01:05:09.981
But to kill yourself ?

01:05:10.064 --> 01:05:12.356
Well, look what Allan's going through,

01:05:12.481 --> 01:05:15.814
some of the others,
when they go through these problems.

01:05:15.897 --> 01:05:21.189
They let themselves get driven crazy
by dealing with what it is.

01:05:21.981 --> 01:05:24.772
I miss Dallas.
He was always good for a laugh.

01:05:25.314 --> 01:05:27.731
Oh, he was. Looked like Santa Claus.

01:05:27.856 --> 01:05:31.772
Played Santa Claus
a couple of times, as far as I know.

01:05:32.064 --> 01:05:34.606
- He always liked fat girls.
- Yeah, big girls.

01:05:34.689 --> 01:05:37.314
The bigger they were,
the better he liked them.

01:05:37.439 --> 01:05:41.189
- Yeah, they were. It's true.
- Never understood that.

01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:45.356
You know,
in Nebraska women are like buses.

01:05:46.439 --> 01:05:48.939
Now wait a second.
You mean size-wise ?

01:05:49.023 --> 01:05:54.106
Not that they come along all the time,
but size-wise they're like buses.

01:05:54.564 --> 01:05:57.481
Know what you call
a good-looking woman in Nebraska ?

01:05:57.606 --> 01:05:59.356
Passing through.

01:06:00.398 --> 01:06:02.231
Tourist.

01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:31.984
Mommy, I'm gonna go
back up with dad.

01:13:36.984 --> 01:13:38.734
It's beautiful !

01:13:46.484 --> 01:13:49.400
It's amazing.
Like sandcastles, exactly.

01:13:50.234 --> 01:13:52.567
But it's supposed to be volcanic.

01:13:54.525 --> 01:13:56.400
Did you read that plaque ?

01:13:58.109 --> 01:14:01.317
Most of the sediment was
wind-blown volcanic ash.

01:14:03.692 --> 01:14:06.775
The ash weathered into clay
and turned into rock.

01:14:09.442 --> 01:14:12.734
Animals were roaming all over
that are now extinct.

01:14:16.192 --> 01:14:18.275
So it's a big graveyard.

01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:22.359
Fossilized... animals.

01:16:52.985 --> 01:16:56.943
Are you okay ? Do you want
to come in the shade with me ?

01:16:57.735 --> 01:17:00.068
Come on, grab on to me.

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:06.693
Sit here in the shade for a bit.

01:17:08.485 --> 01:17:11.360
I'll go get you something to drink.
I'll be back.

01:17:56.985 --> 01:17:58.527
Party !

01:20:29.653 --> 01:20:34.153
So today we have a lot of other people
that came to help in the support

01:20:34.278 --> 01:20:40.278
of the protest to stop the pipeline
that is gonna destroy our waters.

01:20:41.278 --> 01:20:45.319
We have the Mdewakanton Shakopee
tribe that came in today

01:20:46.194 --> 01:20:47.528
and brought supplies.

01:20:48.528 --> 01:20:50.944
And also the Sisseton tribe...

01:20:51.944 --> 01:20:55.486
Thank you
for your support and prayers.

01:20:57.486 --> 01:21:00.069
Dave Swallow from Pine Ridge.
Porcupine !

01:21:01.444 --> 01:21:03.736
Come on up and share some words.

01:21:10.153 --> 01:21:11.820
This is really good !

01:21:11.945 --> 01:21:15.320
When I came down that road and
I saw all these teepees and camps...

01:21:15.778 --> 01:21:18.736
There is something about here
that makes me feel good.

01:21:19.195 --> 01:21:22.570
Even though we have a problem
with the white man over the hill.

01:21:25.528 --> 01:21:29.320
It's really hard, hard, very hard
for me to trust any white man.

01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:32.903
What is that guy doing,
putting the oil...

01:21:33.236 --> 01:21:35.486
Who gave him the permission
to do this ?

01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:38.570
Where did he get the permission
to put...

01:21:38.736 --> 01:21:41.445
Is that a rancher
or somebody's permission to put

01:21:41.695 --> 01:21:43.861
the pipelines right through here ?

01:21:44.653 --> 01:21:47.820
And what is the state troopers
doing on the reservation ?

01:21:49.236 --> 01:21:52.695
There is a lot of these things
running behind the closed doors.

01:21:55.403 --> 01:21:59.195
Indian Reorganization Act of 1934.

01:21:59.945 --> 01:22:02.570
Indian Reorganization !

01:22:04.570 --> 01:22:06.445
But I say we are not Indians.

01:22:06.695 --> 01:22:09.487
We are Lakotas,
Dakotas and Nakotas.

01:22:10.112 --> 01:22:14.278
We are the landlords
of this land here.

01:22:16.028 --> 01:22:19.778
We have a treaty. 1825,
over there, the Missouri River Treaty.

01:22:20.653 --> 01:22:23.987
They put us on separate reservations
to keep us separate,

01:22:24.070 --> 01:22:26.112
so we cannot come together.

01:22:26.570 --> 01:22:28.070
Divide and conquer.

01:22:28.153 --> 01:22:31.862
To hold each and every one of us
individually, not as a group.

01:22:32.862 --> 01:22:35.612
If we come as a group,
they never can break us.

01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:39.612
And that's what they did
on the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty.

01:22:39.945 --> 01:22:43.737
It violated everything.
And how did the treaty come about ?

01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:47.153
Because the white prospectors
found gold in our land.

01:22:48.487 --> 01:22:50.778
Our land. They found gold.

01:22:52.695 --> 01:22:55.028
You have to go back
and do your research.

01:22:55.903 --> 01:22:57.778
And look at it.

01:22:59.528 --> 01:23:03.362
And you'll see what has been done
to the Lakota, Dakota Nation.

01:23:03.904 --> 01:23:06.362
All the nations
of this Turtle Island.

01:23:07.237 --> 01:23:09.279
The so-called United States.

01:23:11.154 --> 01:23:14.654
And I'm gonna pledge allegiance to
the flag ? That's a bunch of bullshit.

01:23:15.029 --> 01:23:16.820
I ain't. Hell no !

01:23:17.195 --> 01:23:19.570
There's no way
I'm gonna pledge allegiance

01:23:19.695 --> 01:23:24.237
to that foreign country
in our own country here.

01:23:25.570 --> 01:23:28.529
These are all ours,
all yours, all here.

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:31.612
We have to get up...

01:23:34.237 --> 01:23:36.195
and we have to go forward.

01:43:12.869 --> 01:43:15.619
It sure gets dark
early at night, doesn't it ?

01:43:16.202 --> 01:43:19.661
And with sunrise later, we better
get ready for the white stuff too.

01:43:19.744 --> 01:43:22.036
Forecast calls for cloudy skies today.

01:43:22.119 --> 01:43:25.744
Our first snowfall this season
coming up this weekend, in fact.

01:43:25.869 --> 01:43:27.661
Low temps at night in the 20s.

01:43:27.744 --> 01:43:30.869
Our forecast for tomorrow
calls for highs in the mid 30s.

01:43:31.119 --> 01:43:33.994
Does winter have to come ?
Does it truly have to come ?

01:44:15.453 --> 01:44:17.328
So when are we gonna head south ?

01:44:17.411 --> 01:44:21.661
Because I get tired of this time
of the year. It always gets to me.

01:44:21.911 --> 01:44:24.661
The days are getting shorter,
a little more gloomy.

01:44:24.786 --> 01:44:28.953
Folks, get your garden winter-ready
if you haven't done it yet.

01:44:29.286 --> 01:44:33.369
Now is the time to stow away
that outdoor furniture.

01:44:33.911 --> 01:44:37.369
Get ready for that white stuff.
Doesn't look like a whole lot for now,

01:44:37.494 --> 01:44:40.578
but there's more snow
to be expected next weekend.

01:44:40.703 --> 01:44:43.203
No use denying it.
Winter is approaching.

01:54:53.790 --> 01:54:55.915
In the beginning

01:54:56.665 --> 01:54:59.581
there was a young woman.

01:55:01.331 --> 01:55:04.956
She had beautiful hair.

01:55:06.331 --> 01:55:12.248
All around everything was good.

01:55:14.623 --> 01:55:20.373
The birds sang.

01:55:22.831 --> 01:55:25.498
One day

01:55:26.665 --> 01:55:29.873
the girl came to the coast

01:55:30.873 --> 01:55:34.873
and saw a big whale in the sea.

01:55:35.873 --> 01:55:38.207
Suddenly

01:55:38.998 --> 01:55:41.790
the whale

01:55:42.665 --> 01:55:46.748
turned into a man.

01:55:47.498 --> 01:55:50.498
She kept looking at the man.

01:55:52.665 --> 01:55:58.665
They started to make love.

01:56:00.290 --> 01:56:04.290
By the next summer
the woman gave birth to a baby whale.

01:56:05.290 --> 01:56:08.832
Later she gave birth

01:56:11.082 --> 01:56:13.873
to boys and girls.

01:56:16.457 --> 01:56:20.165
Eventually the woman grew very old.

01:56:21.082 --> 01:56:23.790
And her grandchildren

01:56:24.123 --> 01:56:26.582
had stopped listening to her.

01:56:27.748 --> 01:56:30.582
One day the grandchildren said:

01:56:31.582 --> 01:56:34.499
"Let's kill a whale !

01:56:35.374 --> 01:56:38.165
"What will you do about it,
old woman ?"

01:56:38.957 --> 01:56:41.707
She replied:
Please don't !

01:56:42.415 --> 01:56:44.665
"I'm warning you.
We all originate from a whale."

01:59:26.791 --> 01:59:28.916
The next morning

01:59:31.208 --> 01:59:34.208
they came to see the whale
on the coast.

01:59:34.541 --> 01:59:37.208
But he had turned into a man,
even with hair.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:41.958
"Alas !

01:59:43.041 --> 01:59:46.083
"The old woman's prophecy

01:59:48.625 --> 01:59:53.125
has come true.

01:59:54.458 --> 01:59:56.500
She was right."

02:04:11.126 --> 02:04:14.668
For Lillian Alling who disappeared

02:04:14.918 --> 02:04:20.335
while attempting to walk
from New York to Russia.
