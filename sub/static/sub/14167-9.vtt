00:21.782 --> 00:24.583
Jay, wake up.

00:24.618 --> 00:27.921
Jay, come on! Get up!

00:29.956 --> 00:32.591
Hey! Easy. Gentle.

00:32.625 --> 00:34.927
Just fucking be gentle
with your big brother.

00:34.961 --> 00:36.595
Now, come on.

00:36.630 --> 00:38.597
It's cut day, young man.

00:38.632 --> 00:41.767
Lisa wants us at the weigh-in
by 8:30, so get out of bed.

00:41.802 --> 00:43.001
Let's go.

00:43.036 --> 00:44.503
Come on.

00:44.538 --> 00:45.838
Did you draw me a bath?

00:45.872 --> 00:49.007
Hot and salty.

00:49.042 --> 00:50.909
- Let's go.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:53.980 --> 00:56.114
I love cut day.

00:56.149 --> 00:57.950
- No, you don't.
- I do, indeed.

00:57.984 --> 01:00.518
I find it very cleansing, Nate.

01:00.553 --> 01:02.187
Plus, I only got 10 pounds,

01:02.222 --> 01:04.688
and I'm gonna poop out
five of them right now.

01:04.724 --> 01:07.359
But Ryan...

01:07.393 --> 01:10.362
Ryan's fucked.

01:10.396 --> 01:12.029
Yeah, what's he got?

01:12.064 --> 01:14.198
Around 20, 25.

01:19.004 --> 01:21.138
Fuck him.

01:21.173 --> 01:23.807
Fuck him.

01:23.842 --> 01:26.844
We march!

02:45.187 --> 02:48.824
You seen Alvey?

02:48.858 --> 02:51.660
Uh, I thought I heard him this morning.

02:51.694 --> 02:53.328
What time?

02:53.362 --> 02:56.498
5:30, 6:00. Is there a problem?

02:56.532 --> 03:00.501
No problem. Just, uh, haven't seen him.

03:02.704 --> 03:05.340
Fuck. Hot, hot. Hot. Itchy balls.

03:05.374 --> 03:06.841
Itchy balls, itchy balls, itchy balls,

03:06.875 --> 03:11.212
itchy balls, itchy balls.

03:16.217 --> 03:18.018
I got to tell you something.

03:18.052 --> 03:20.020
- Could it wait, perhaps?
- No.

03:20.054 --> 03:22.022
Daddy's taking a bath.

03:22.056 --> 03:25.192
No. Jay, I got to tell you.

03:25.226 --> 03:27.194
What's up?

03:27.228 --> 03:30.030
Uh, I'm not...

03:30.064 --> 03:33.700
I'm not gonna press
charges against those guys.

03:33.734 --> 03:35.035
I called the detective today.

03:35.069 --> 03:36.936
I t... I told him it's over.

03:39.474 --> 03:40.874
Look, that shit's behind me now.

03:40.908 --> 03:42.175
I just want to get back to...

03:42.210 --> 03:44.677
To training so I can start fighting again.

03:44.712 --> 03:47.914
I'm gonna tell dad today.

03:56.323 --> 03:59.492
I think that's the best thing.

04:01.795 --> 04:04.596
I don't give a fuck about those guys.

04:04.631 --> 04:08.434
I give a fuck about you.

04:08.468 --> 04:10.469
Shit's behind us.

04:15.008 --> 04:16.808
All right, 20 more minutes in there.

04:16.843 --> 04:17.942
I'll get the, uh, plastics,

04:17.976 --> 04:20.946
and we'll run over to the gym, all right?

04:20.980 --> 04:24.115
Aye, aye, captain.

04:55.681 --> 04:58.983
You've reached Alvey Kulina.
Please leave a message.

05:00.118 --> 05:02.920
Hi. Where are you? I'm in your office.

05:02.955 --> 05:06.423
And it looks like you were here.

05:06.458 --> 05:08.593
Call me.

05:13.998 --> 05:16.133
Welcome to the sunset Hawaiian.

05:16.167 --> 05:17.801
- Can I help you?
- I'd like a room.

05:17.835 --> 05:21.805
All righty. Just need a
credit card and a picture I.D.

05:21.839 --> 05:24.975
Credit card. Picture I.D.

05:25.009 --> 05:29.980
How long will you be
staying with us, Mr. Kulina?

05:30.014 --> 05:32.315
I have no idea.

05:32.349 --> 05:33.984
No problem.

05:34.018 --> 05:36.152
Maybe forever.

05:38.022 --> 05:41.524
Okay. You are all set.

05:41.558 --> 05:44.026
- Do you need any help with your luggage?
- I got it.

05:44.060 --> 05:47.230
- Please enjoy your stay.
- I will.

05:50.434 --> 05:51.400
Hey.

05:51.435 --> 05:53.402
Whew!

05:53.437 --> 05:55.070
Buenos dÃ­as, Shelby.

05:55.105 --> 05:56.405
Lisa wants to see you guys.

05:56.440 --> 05:57.806
Indeedy-greasy.

05:57.841 --> 06:00.075
What's up, lady?

06:00.110 --> 06:01.910
Hi. Can you shut the door?

06:01.945 --> 06:05.080
- How are you feeling?
- Wonderful.

06:05.115 --> 06:07.916
Like I said, I have an easy fucking cut.

06:07.951 --> 06:09.151
Where's Wheeler?

06:09.185 --> 06:10.819
He should be putting his plastics on,

06:10.854 --> 06:13.155
but we've got a bit of an issue.

06:13.189 --> 06:15.658
I don't know where your dad is.

06:15.692 --> 06:17.492
What are you talking about?

06:17.527 --> 06:19.827
I mean, he was here earlier.
I've been trying to call him.

06:19.862 --> 06:21.996
He's not answering his phone.

06:22.031 --> 06:24.166
Honestly, Jay, I'm not worried about you.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.833
But Ryan, he's got a lot of work to do

06:25.868 --> 06:26.934
before the weigh-in.

06:26.969 --> 06:29.771
Hey, it's not our problem, okay?

06:29.805 --> 06:31.439
Nate and I are gonna
get the engine started.

06:31.474 --> 06:33.574
It's gonna be fine.

06:33.608 --> 06:35.609
It's gonna be fine.

06:35.644 --> 06:38.279
We got you.

07:06.107 --> 07:08.441
Eh.

07:19.386 --> 07:22.055
20 pounds. It's got to happen.

07:24.725 --> 07:26.025
You know, when I was in prison...

07:26.059 --> 07:28.194
Wait a second. Wait. Hold on a second.

07:28.229 --> 07:29.862
You were in prison?

07:29.896 --> 07:32.365
Holy shit. I did not know that.

07:32.399 --> 07:34.200
Nate, did you know that?

07:34.235 --> 07:35.868
- Yeah, yeah. I heard that once.
- Oh.

07:35.902 --> 07:39.205
- From what I hear, he was very popular.
- I was, actually. I was.

07:39.239 --> 07:41.306
People happen to enjoy my company.

07:41.341 --> 07:43.442
And are you guys fucking finished?

07:43.476 --> 07:48.114
Anyway, when I was in prison,

07:48.148 --> 07:54.120
I once saw a guy slice a
line across his forehead

07:54.154 --> 07:58.123
and then dig his
fingernails in under the flap

07:58.157 --> 08:04.296
and peel himself like a banana, Nate.

08:04.330 --> 08:07.299
That makes more sense to me

08:07.333 --> 08:09.668
than getting in that
fucking suit right now.

08:12.238 --> 08:13.238
You know, some of us

08:13.272 --> 08:14.939
would love to be cutting weight today,

08:14.974 --> 08:18.977
but some of us suffered
a devastating injury

08:19.011 --> 08:22.480
and don't have the privilege.

08:22.514 --> 08:25.516
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

08:25.550 --> 08:29.186
Fuck you guys. Put me in the fucking suit.

08:40.399 --> 08:42.700
Where's your dad?

08:42.734 --> 08:44.702
I don't know.

08:44.736 --> 08:47.370
But you don't have time to wait.

08:51.536 --> 08:54.004
Hey, Connie, those 12s?

08:54.039 --> 08:57.407
Um...God almighty, you're getting big.

08:59.778 --> 09:02.412
In a good way.

09:02.447 --> 09:04.247
Shit.

09:04.282 --> 09:08.285
I'm gonna get written up for that.

09:22.532 --> 09:25.167
No glass
by the pool, big time.

09:25.202 --> 09:26.669
What's that?

09:26.704 --> 09:29.038
Uh, your screwdriver needs
to be in a plastic cup.

09:29.073 --> 09:30.773
Broken glass gets into the pool,
I got to drain the whole thing.

09:30.808 --> 09:33.275
- It's... it's a nightmare.
- Okay.

09:33.310 --> 09:34.944
Thank you.

09:34.979 --> 09:36.779
Thanks.

09:36.814 --> 09:37.946
I'm Degranzo. I own the hotel.

09:37.981 --> 09:39.536
Alvey. Yeah.

09:39.585 --> 09:42.553
It's a nice place you got here.

09:42.588 --> 09:44.055
What brings you out here?

09:44.090 --> 09:46.057
Ah, I'm taking the day off.

09:46.092 --> 09:49.060
Hey, you know what? Good
for you. Good for you.

09:49.095 --> 09:50.896
We don't do that enough as a culture.

09:50.930 --> 09:52.663
Between work, women, whatever it is,

09:52.698 --> 09:54.331
man needs to decompress.

09:54.366 --> 09:56.401
You give a man five minutes to breathe,

09:56.435 --> 09:58.135
it'll cut the murder rate down.

09:58.169 --> 09:59.970
And the divorce rate.

10:00.005 --> 10:02.473
Anyhow, I'll leave you to it.

10:02.508 --> 10:04.141
You want ice for that?

10:04.175 --> 10:05.976
If it's not too much trouble.

10:06.011 --> 10:07.311
Hey, you didn't bring no shorts?

10:07.345 --> 10:09.146
No, no. I'm okay, man.

10:09.180 --> 10:10.847
Alvey, it's hotter than shit out here.

10:10.882 --> 10:12.917
You know what? I got an extra
pair of trunks. Let me set you up.

10:12.951 --> 10:15.319
No, don't bother yourself.
I'm... I'm good like this.

10:15.353 --> 10:17.654
- Yeah, got you. I'll be back with the ice.
- All right.

10:27.398 --> 10:31.034
Boy, you know what would
look great right here?

10:32.169 --> 10:34.304
It's like some sort of... I don't know...

10:34.338 --> 10:36.473
Like, a reflective surface,

10:36.507 --> 10:39.142
so as a fighter might be
able to see themselves.

10:41.579 --> 10:43.212
I don't know. Kind of like a...

10:43.247 --> 10:46.082
I got it.

10:46.116 --> 10:48.918
Like a mirror. That's
what I'm talking about.

10:48.953 --> 10:52.588
Like a nice, big fucking
rectangular mirror here

10:52.622 --> 10:55.591
and maybe... I don't know...

10:55.625 --> 10:58.761
A nice big mirror there.

10:58.795 --> 11:01.023
I apologized, and I'm
going to pay for that.

11:01.134 --> 11:02.896
Oh, boy.

11:02.966 --> 11:05.267
Ryan, I got to tell you.

11:05.301 --> 11:07.102
I enjoy watching you and Alvey

11:07.136 --> 11:09.605
like two hairless little monkeys

11:09.639 --> 11:12.608
grunting over the same female species.

11:12.642 --> 11:14.610
It's quite a show you're putting on.

11:14.644 --> 11:17.279
Are you gonna be fucking
with me all day or...

11:17.313 --> 11:20.949
- Are you gonna make weight?
- Yes.

11:20.984 --> 11:24.286
Because you're a professional fighter,

11:24.320 --> 11:25.954
- and that's your job.
- Mmhmm.

11:25.989 --> 11:28.890
When you don't make
weight, it's unprofessional.

11:28.924 --> 11:31.226
- This is coming from you.
- Who always makes weight.

11:31.260 --> 11:33.661
- Who doesn't always make his fights.
- But I always make weight,

11:33.696 --> 11:36.664
so why don't you do your job, convict?

11:36.699 --> 11:39.667
You got it, buddy. You fucking got it.

11:39.702 --> 11:43.838
Hey, yeah! Whoo! Whoo!

11:43.873 --> 11:45.473
Whoo-hoo!

11:47.476 --> 11:49.410
Look, that's what I'm talking about.

11:49.444 --> 11:51.745
If your dad sees this...
If you tweak that knee,

11:51.779 --> 11:53.481
I'm gonna get my balls kicked into my ass.

11:53.515 --> 11:56.484
I don't see him anywhere.
Let's fucking go. Come on.

11:59.854 --> 12:01.989
Oh, God damn it!

12:02.024 --> 12:04.158
That is what I'm talking about.

12:06.394 --> 12:09.696
Call me back, please.

12:09.731 --> 12:12.232
I'm starting to get worried.

12:32.386 --> 12:34.187
We got company.

12:34.221 --> 12:35.855
Where do you think they're from?

12:35.889 --> 12:37.190
I have no idea.

12:37.224 --> 12:39.191
Take a guess, man.

12:39.225 --> 12:40.492
Uh, Kansas?

12:40.527 --> 12:43.829
No.  You see their sandals?

12:43.864 --> 12:45.998
That bag? Kind of weird-looking, right?

12:46.033 --> 12:50.670
Yeah, they got that, uh,
American-tourist style.

12:50.704 --> 12:52.905
Knock-offs, you know?

12:52.940 --> 12:54.574
If I'm betting, I would
say former Yugoslavia -

12:54.608 --> 12:55.907
that area.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.576
- We get them here a lot.
- Oh, yeah?

12:57.610 --> 12:59.911
Yeah, they're freezing their
asses off on some goat farm,

12:59.946 --> 13:02.247
need a vacation, so they go on the web

13:02.282 --> 13:04.416
and search "sunny
California, hotel, Hawaii."

13:04.451 --> 13:06.751
Boom! There we are.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.688
The sunset Hawaii in sunny California.

13:09.722 --> 13:12.023
Shocks the shit out of
them when they pull up.

13:12.058 --> 13:14.893
But we do look good on the Internet.

13:16.462 --> 13:19.664
They'll be topless in 15 minutes.

13:19.699 --> 13:20.832
Come on.

13:20.866 --> 13:24.335
Europeans. Europeans, yeah.

13:24.369 --> 13:26.404
I been to Dagestan a few times.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.108
Yeah? What took you out there?

13:30.142 --> 13:31.609
Scouting talent.

13:31.643 --> 13:33.444
I train fighters for a living.

13:33.479 --> 13:36.280
Best wrestlers are from Dagestan.

13:36.315 --> 13:37.948
War-torn men... Tough people.

13:37.983 --> 13:39.950
Oh, you got a... You
got a gym or something?

13:39.985 --> 13:43.121
Yeah, in Venice. Surviving.

13:43.155 --> 13:45.188
Which is no easy task in my line of work.

13:45.223 --> 13:46.790
Hey, did you ever fight?

13:46.825 --> 13:50.460
My whole life. Yeah.
Coaching grew out of that.

13:50.495 --> 13:52.696
Stay with your passion.

13:52.731 --> 13:53.864
Yeah, it's good to have a world,

13:53.898 --> 13:57.534
something to define you, you know?

13:57.568 --> 14:00.704
It ain't the same, though.

14:00.739 --> 14:03.206
How's that?

14:03.241 --> 14:05.375
Well, fighters don't always
make the best coaches.

14:05.409 --> 14:06.643
It's two different things.

14:06.677 --> 14:08.978
You know, when you're a
fighter, it's all about you.

14:09.013 --> 14:10.547
When you're a coach, it's about them.

14:10.581 --> 14:13.049
Makes sense. How did you adjust?

14:13.083 --> 14:16.719
I don't know. Raised a couple of boys.

14:16.754 --> 14:19.789
You know, fatherhood saws off the edges.

14:19.823 --> 14:23.292
Not about you anymore, so I take that

14:23.326 --> 14:27.296
and I... I apply it to my fighters.

14:27.330 --> 14:30.967
Sublimation... If you can't do that,

14:31.001 --> 14:33.970
then you flame out as
a father and as a coach.

14:34.004 --> 14:36.004
- Lesson learned.
- Yeah.

14:38.475 --> 14:39.608
Aha! What did I tell you?

14:39.643 --> 14:40.776
Look at that. There you go.

14:40.810 --> 14:42.778
- Euro-fucking-peans.
- Boy.

14:42.812 --> 14:44.480
Here, let me top you off.

14:44.514 --> 14:47.149
All right. Little more ice, too.

14:47.184 --> 14:48.484
Yeah, see what the ladies want.

14:48.518 --> 14:50.653
Maybe a bit.

14:50.687 --> 14:52.417
Yeah, it's not good.

14:52.479 --> 14:54.246
Yeah, there's a prescription for 30.

14:54.281 --> 14:55.514
There's 28 pills left.

14:55.548 --> 14:57.783
I mean, he must have stopped
taking these weeks ago.

14:57.817 --> 14:58.951
He didn't tell you?

14:58.985 --> 15:00.953
I should have known
that something was wrong.

15:00.987 --> 15:03.289
He's been drinking a lot.
He's sleeping on the couch.

15:03.323 --> 15:04.556
We got in a huge fucking fight

15:04.590 --> 15:06.225
the night that he came home from your mom.

15:06.259 --> 15:08.560
And he's been all over the place.

15:08.594 --> 15:10.995
You want me to call some hospitals?

15:11.030 --> 15:13.331
No. No. I got this.

15:13.365 --> 15:15.266
You just focus on the cut
and keep Ryan on track,

15:15.301 --> 15:16.668
'cause if he doesn't make weight,

15:16.702 --> 15:18.036
that's a whole nother shit show.

15:18.070 --> 15:19.404
All right.

15:24.710 --> 15:27.178
He did this to my mom a few times.

15:27.212 --> 15:29.780
That doesn't help, but thanks.

15:31.650 --> 15:33.617
- He's gonna show up.
- Mmhmm.

15:33.652 --> 15:35.186
I'd give you a big, reassuring hug,

15:35.220 --> 15:37.021
let you know that, but I don't think the...

15:37.056 --> 15:38.356
Oh, I'm good. Appreciate it.

15:38.390 --> 15:40.191
- Open or closed?
- Closed.

15:40.225 --> 15:42.960
All right.

15:42.994 --> 15:44.227
Look, you got to get me

15:44.262 --> 15:47.297
out of this rat reapers
shit, man. Sit down.

15:47.332 --> 15:49.600
Look, I can't do it anymore.

15:49.634 --> 15:52.269
What do you want to do?

15:52.303 --> 15:55.105
Something better. What else you got?

15:55.139 --> 15:57.608
Huh, let's see.

15:57.642 --> 15:59.609
Um...

15:59.643 --> 16:01.445
Would you be willing to move to wall street

16:01.479 --> 16:03.780
and run a hedge fund?

16:03.814 --> 16:04.948
How about cardiology?

16:04.983 --> 16:07.217
You got any experience in that field?

16:07.251 --> 16:08.718
I mean, they might balk at
your history of sexual assault,

16:08.752 --> 16:10.387
but I'll vouch for you.

16:10.421 --> 16:12.722
I'll tell them you're different now.

16:14.092 --> 16:16.392
I'm sorry, but killing rats

16:16.426 --> 16:19.529
is probably the zenith of your potential.

16:19.563 --> 16:21.397
Well, why can't I have the
same deal as Ryan Wheeler?

16:21.431 --> 16:23.666
You got that deal.

16:23.701 --> 16:25.165
He ain't killing rats.
He's at the gym all day.

16:25.190 --> 16:26.225
What do you mean?

16:26.269 --> 16:27.971
Yeah, for a while, we were picking him up

16:28.005 --> 16:29.405
and dropping him off at some gym

16:29.439 --> 16:31.674
and then picking him back up
on the way home... carpool.

16:31.709 --> 16:35.677
But now...We don't even do that no more.

16:39.383 --> 16:43.019
Nate, Mac. It's time.

16:43.053 --> 16:45.687
Where's Wheeler? Is he quitting already?

16:45.722 --> 16:48.857
I'm up here, dick.

16:48.892 --> 16:51.192
Warm-up's over, destroyer.

16:51.227 --> 16:54.730
The dragon is hungry.

17:03.205 --> 17:05.205
Seven over.

17:07.576 --> 17:09.377
Come on, champ. All right, good.

17:09.412 --> 17:12.213
Come on, champ. Yeah.

17:12.248 --> 17:14.482
Fuck. Seriously?

17:16.885 --> 17:18.819
18 to go.

17:25.393 --> 17:27.461
Hey, this too shall pass.

17:27.494 --> 17:29.797
Let's go.

17:29.831 --> 17:32.399
Aw, the gentility

17:32.434 --> 17:34.569
of Mac's hand is not to be underestimated.

17:34.603 --> 17:36.236
That's not the... that's not
the word you're looking...

17:36.271 --> 17:37.705
"Gentility's" not the
word you're looking for.

17:37.739 --> 17:39.306
It's the big man's hands.
Oh, yeah, big man's hands.

17:41.342 --> 17:42.409
Here we go.

17:44.011 --> 17:46.246
All right. Go get a bottle.

17:58.258 --> 18:00.827
Halfway! Halfway!

18:04.632 --> 18:07.266
Let's fucking push it.

18:07.301 --> 18:08.768
Let's go! Pick it up!

18:29.188 --> 18:32.157
Alvey. Alvey.

18:32.191 --> 18:34.159
- You got to be careful, pal.
- What?

18:34.193 --> 18:35.527
You'll bake out here.

18:35.561 --> 18:37.195
Come on. Have some agua.

18:38.498 --> 18:40.465
You're gonna never be my color,

18:40.500 --> 18:42.134
no matter how much you lay out here, okay?

18:42.168 --> 18:44.103
- I fell asleep there.
- All right.

18:44.137 --> 18:45.803
So, you got plans for tonight?

18:45.838 --> 18:48.306
No, man. I have no plans.

18:48.341 --> 18:51.309
Let's get some dinner.
Come on. Don't worry.

18:51.344 --> 18:52.477
I'm not into that, all right?

18:52.512 --> 18:53.945
Just I'm starved for company. Indulge me.

18:53.979 --> 18:56.814
- It's on the house.
- All right.

18:56.849 --> 18:58.617
All right, you get get cleaned
up. I'll knock on your door.

18:58.651 --> 18:59.884
- All right.
- Right?

18:59.918 --> 19:01.385
You sure about the shorts?
What? They don't fit?

19:01.419 --> 19:02.553
I don't want the shorts, man.

19:02.587 --> 19:05.222
Okay, all right. Well, get cleaned up.

19:05.257 --> 19:07.158
Yeah.

19:14.099 --> 19:15.900
- 15 over.
- Three fucking pounds.

19:15.934 --> 19:17.901
That's... that's all I've
lost... three fucking pounds?

19:17.935 --> 19:19.903
Hey, focus. We're just getting started.

19:19.937 --> 19:22.406
- Focus?
- You got plenty of fucking time, dude.

19:22.440 --> 19:24.408
We're gonna be good. I'm
saying focus on us right now.

19:24.442 --> 19:26.076
Don't worry about this.

19:26.110 --> 19:28.845
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

19:28.880 --> 19:30.347
Um, can you go talk to Lisa?

19:30.382 --> 19:31.515
Yeah, is she all right?

19:31.550 --> 19:33.584
Yeah, just go keep her company, you know?

19:33.618 --> 19:35.919
Hey, Jay, where the fuck is your dad?

19:35.953 --> 19:37.087
We don't know, Ryan.

19:37.121 --> 19:39.089
Why are you such a bitch when you cut,

19:39.123 --> 19:41.925
like you're the first
person to ever fucking do it?

19:41.959 --> 19:44.294
Sorry.

19:44.328 --> 19:45.962
Well put.

19:45.997 --> 19:48.431
Mac and I got this.

19:48.465 --> 19:50.766
- I'm sorry, man.
- Hey, you're barking at me

19:50.801 --> 19:54.270
like I'm a fucking goddamn mailman, dude.

19:54.305 --> 19:55.605
Take it easy.

19:55.639 --> 19:57.940
You know daddy loves you
with this firm fucking ass.

19:57.974 --> 19:59.775
- Let's make you... Come on, man.
- Not right now.

19:59.810 --> 20:01.578
Please. Relax.

20:30.840 --> 20:33.141
Motherfucker.

20:38.414 --> 20:39.881
Can I have one?

20:39.915 --> 20:42.250
Not even funny.

20:47.223 --> 20:48.723
How you feeling?

20:51.227 --> 20:52.693
Your dad just texted.

20:52.728 --> 20:55.230
He said he's okay. He's safe.

21:00.935 --> 21:03.237
Obviously, this is a really
fucked-up thing to do,

21:03.272 --> 21:07.241
but it's not entirely his fault.

21:07.276 --> 21:09.410
I don't know if Jay told you,

21:09.444 --> 21:12.079
but he stopped taking his medication.

21:12.113 --> 21:14.581
No, he didn't.

21:14.615 --> 21:16.083
- Why would he stop?
- I don't know.

21:16.117 --> 21:17.918
- I thought it was helping.
- I know. I did, too.

21:17.952 --> 21:21.588
He just did it.

21:25.459 --> 21:29.429
You know what? He's
got a lot on his mind -

21:29.463 --> 21:31.431
the fights here, your mom,

21:31.465 --> 21:33.060
he's really upset about
what happened to you...

21:33.097 --> 21:34.551
You should leave him.

21:34.600 --> 21:37.504
You don't deserve this shit.

21:37.538 --> 21:39.839
I know he's got problems,
but h-he could help himself.

21:39.873 --> 21:41.374
He just chooses not to.

21:41.409 --> 21:44.344
No, Nate, I'm sorry.
We're gonna work it out.

21:44.378 --> 21:48.347
Why? What... What's to work out?

21:48.381 --> 21:50.482
What are you getting out of this?

21:52.385 --> 21:53.853
I love him,

21:53.887 --> 21:57.190
and I love you guys, and I...

21:57.224 --> 21:58.457
Fuck, Nate.

21:58.491 --> 22:00.459
I cannot have this
conversation with you right now.

22:00.493 --> 22:04.630
Could you just please
go inside and help them?

22:13.139 --> 22:15.474
We love you, Lisa.

22:43.832 --> 22:46.233
Come on.

22:47.836 --> 22:51.138
Thank you.

22:51.172 --> 22:53.173
Kisses.

22:58.751 --> 23:00.218
This guy I'm fighting... Rynders...

23:00.252 --> 23:02.386
Is a fucking beast.

23:02.421 --> 23:05.389
He's like... His tape is sick.

23:05.424 --> 23:09.060
He's just tearing through guys.

23:09.095 --> 23:11.896
Yep. But you know what?

23:11.931 --> 23:14.432
He's not gonna tear through you.

23:14.466 --> 23:18.068
Nah, you're gonna send
him back to fucking Florida

23:18.103 --> 23:20.104
with his dick in a knot.

23:23.609 --> 23:25.576
I admire you, Jay.

23:25.611 --> 23:29.079
I'm an admirable man, Mr. Wheeler.

23:29.114 --> 23:31.181
I'm serious. The way you live.

23:31.215 --> 23:34.184
I don't know how you're still sane,

23:34.218 --> 23:36.186
because I'm not, man.

23:36.220 --> 23:38.689
I think I'm out of my fucking mind.

23:38.723 --> 23:41.358
Shit. You're doing good.

23:41.392 --> 23:45.362
The fact that you haven't
had your head spin off...

23:45.396 --> 23:49.199
That's a victory.

23:49.233 --> 23:52.035
Well, I think it's just

23:52.069 --> 23:54.737
stuck on there really tight.

24:01.612 --> 24:05.247
I'm still in love with Lisa.

24:05.282 --> 24:07.283
Probably even more now.

24:16.994 --> 24:19.128
She still has my ring.

24:19.163 --> 24:21.664
She tell you that?

24:23.233 --> 24:26.202
It's hard moving on.

24:26.236 --> 24:28.204
I shouldn't have to.

24:28.238 --> 24:31.207
I mean, if I got something good,

24:31.241 --> 24:33.242
I'm not backing off.

24:36.445 --> 24:38.747
It's nothing against your dad.

24:38.781 --> 24:41.750
It's just...

24:41.784 --> 24:43.752
It's just how I feel.

25:05.040 --> 25:07.508
Oh, shit!

25:08.544 --> 25:10.677
- Oh, God damn it.
- Hey, I saw that.

25:10.712 --> 25:12.046
Come on. Get off.

25:12.080 --> 25:14.014
Sit down.

25:14.049 --> 25:15.716
Get off the knee.

25:17.385 --> 25:19.720
I'm getting an ice pack.

25:32.400 --> 25:34.701
- 11 over.
- What the fuck?

25:34.736 --> 25:35.869
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Stop.
- Jesus fucking Christ.

25:35.903 --> 25:37.704
You're halfway there, man. Come on.

25:37.739 --> 25:40.707
- Fuck.
- Halfway there.

25:41.909 --> 25:43.877
Where the fuck is Alvey, man?

25:43.911 --> 25:46.880
Dude, Alvey's dealing with some shit.

25:46.914 --> 25:50.250
Oh, I'm sorry. He's dealing with some shit?

25:50.284 --> 25:52.585
Wrong fucking answer,
man. I'm in fucking hell.

25:52.619 --> 25:54.754
No, you're in a fucking
sauna is what you are.

25:54.789 --> 25:57.924
He's dealing with real shit... Emotionally.

25:57.958 --> 26:00.326
I think you're somebody
who could appreciate that.

26:00.360 --> 26:02.662
And if you want to be
fucking honest with yourself,

26:02.696 --> 26:04.664
you're probably a part of that.

26:04.698 --> 26:06.165
Me?

26:06.199 --> 26:08.167
Jay, I didn't even want to fucking be here.

26:08.201 --> 26:11.103
He begged me to be here.

26:11.137 --> 26:12.371
And he said that he had a plan,

26:12.406 --> 26:13.806
and then he... He fucking punked out.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.373
But, you know, you're not
really being great, either,

26:15.408 --> 26:17.075
you know, ripping up the
fucking gym, pissing in the cage.

26:17.110 --> 26:18.177
Jesus. Jesus, Jay.

26:18.211 --> 26:21.346
I told you, I will fix
the fucking mirror, Jay.

26:21.380 --> 26:23.315
I will fix the mirror, okay?!

26:23.349 --> 26:25.017
I have a real fucking
problem with this, man.

26:25.051 --> 26:26.985
- He should be here. He's my coach.
- Hey, I get it.

26:27.020 --> 26:28.821
It's not the fucking way
a coach should act, man.

26:28.855 --> 26:30.422
You fucking bitch, bitch, bitch. I get it.

26:30.456 --> 26:31.989
Why don't you focus on your fucking cut?

26:32.024 --> 26:33.224
This is what we do.

26:33.258 --> 26:35.560
If it was fucking easy,
everybody would do it.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.395
But you're a champion, Wheeler.

26:37.430 --> 26:41.433
Why don't you focus on this fucking cut?

26:43.336 --> 26:47.505
This is what we fucking do.

26:49.308 --> 26:52.143
Do you want this? Step up.

26:55.380 --> 27:00.351
- Hmm-hmm.
- Okay. Okay.

27:00.385 --> 27:01.518
No lunch. Let's go.

27:01.553 --> 27:03.354
I think I just need some air, man.

27:03.388 --> 27:05.356
I just... yeah, I'm
just gonna take a break.

27:05.390 --> 27:06.857
- Take a breath.
- Just need to take a break for a second

27:06.891 --> 27:08.692
- and get some air, and then we'll go back in.
- There you go.

27:08.727 --> 27:09.860
- No air. Let's go inside.
- No, no, no. No, no.

27:09.894 --> 27:12.563
You know what your
opponent's doing right now?

27:12.597 --> 27:14.698
He's sweating. He's losing weight.

27:14.733 --> 27:18.034
He's working fucking hard.

27:18.069 --> 27:21.037
But he's not a champion.

27:21.072 --> 27:23.706
He's not the fucking destroyer.

27:23.741 --> 27:26.542
He's not Ryan fucking Wheeler -

27:26.577 --> 27:31.581
champion of the world!

27:31.615 --> 27:33.984
You got this, dude.

27:34.018 --> 27:36.719
This is what we fucking
do every fucking day.

27:36.754 --> 27:38.388
Aah!

27:38.422 --> 27:40.222
Put the fucking pants on. Let's do it.

27:40.257 --> 27:43.626
Where's... which one's my fucking pants?

27:50.300 --> 27:54.270
Well, one thing I do
not have is a martyr complex.

27:54.304 --> 27:56.571
You know, some people look for
pain so they can wallow in it,

27:56.606 --> 27:58.407
and that kind of shit disgusts me.

27:58.441 --> 27:59.574
Yeah.

27:59.609 --> 28:01.343
Not that I'm without suffering.

28:01.378 --> 28:02.577
I've suffered plenty...

28:02.612 --> 28:09.084
Injuries, bones, ligaments, depression.

28:09.119 --> 28:10.419
I go in the tank sometimes.

28:10.453 --> 28:11.686
You live long enough,

28:11.721 --> 28:13.688
you're gonna have some rainy days, hmm?

28:13.723 --> 28:15.356
I just don't...

28:15.391 --> 28:18.860
I don't feel the need to... To announce it,

28:18.895 --> 28:19.928
- you know what I mean?
- Mm-hmm.

28:19.962 --> 28:22.931
My wife... my wife,

28:22.965 --> 28:25.434
when she felt something, it was everywhere.

28:25.468 --> 28:27.201
It was in the atmosphere, you know?

28:27.236 --> 28:29.070
When Christina was upset, I was upset.

28:29.104 --> 28:31.772
The boys were upset. The
fucking dog was upset.

28:31.807 --> 28:34.208
The plant was depressed, you know?

28:34.243 --> 28:37.378
I'll take moody all day. I
mean, let them burn bright.

28:37.413 --> 28:38.646
And the sex is better, too.

28:38.680 --> 28:40.815
- Oh, that's true.
- Right?

28:40.849 --> 28:42.483
It's marinating in its own juices.

28:42.517 --> 28:44.985
Ohh.

28:45.019 --> 28:46.987
And, uh, you know, I'm not being fair.

28:47.021 --> 28:49.156
She wasn't totally crazy.

28:49.190 --> 28:50.958
You know, it's more complicated than that.

28:50.992 --> 28:52.960
Christina...

28:52.994 --> 28:54.962
That's the one you're still married to.

28:54.996 --> 28:58.265
Technically, I'm mar...
It's, uh... we're estranged.

28:58.299 --> 28:59.767
And then there's Lisa,

28:59.801 --> 29:01.301
the young one you still live with?

29:01.336 --> 29:04.004
Man, come on.

29:04.038 --> 29:05.172
You... You'd be a clichÃ©,

29:05.206 --> 29:06.606
but you never got divorced
from the first one.

29:06.640 --> 29:07.941
"I got two women, and my life is horrible."

29:07.976 --> 29:10.610
No. No, no, no. It ain't like that. No.

29:10.644 --> 29:12.346
Then why did, uh...

29:12.380 --> 29:15.315
Why did you and Christina split up, anyway?

29:15.350 --> 29:18.818
Ah, she was an addict. She is an addict.

29:18.853 --> 29:21.020
- Yeah.
- I couldn't live with her, you know?

29:21.054 --> 29:22.188
She wasn't good for my boys.

29:22.222 --> 29:23.957
Not that I was such a
great husband, you know.

29:23.991 --> 29:26.960
I was traveling around the
world, fighting, never home.

29:26.994 --> 29:30.797
When I was there, I wasn't there, you know?

29:30.831 --> 29:32.298
When you come off the road, you know,

29:32.332 --> 29:33.966
there's a... There's a...

29:34.001 --> 29:35.334
I don't know. How do I say this?

29:35.369 --> 29:36.835
There's a letdown when you come home.

29:36.870 --> 29:38.670
How's that?

29:38.705 --> 29:41.474
Oh, I'm young. I'm in Tokyo.

29:41.508 --> 29:42.975
I'm beating the shit
out of a Brazilian dude

29:43.010 --> 29:44.643
in front of 15,000 Japanese people.

29:44.677 --> 29:47.346
They're screaming my name
like I'm a fucking God.

29:47.381 --> 29:49.348
I got a broad in my
hotel room waiting for me.

29:49.383 --> 29:53.351
I got booze. I got drugs. I
got whatever I want, right?

29:53.386 --> 29:55.687
I'm the man, you know?

29:55.722 --> 29:58.189
And then I come home.

29:58.224 --> 30:00.526
I come home. It's quiet, man.

30:00.560 --> 30:03.695
No juice.

30:03.730 --> 30:05.531
I lost my shit.

30:05.565 --> 30:08.033
You know? No, no. No balance.
I didn't have any balance.

30:08.067 --> 30:09.034
That's bullshit.

30:09.068 --> 30:10.502
If it's there for the taking,

30:10.536 --> 30:12.337
9 out of 10 guys, they're gonna take it.

30:12.371 --> 30:14.672
It's human nature. I imagine it was...

30:14.706 --> 30:16.874
It was worse in your line of work, right?

30:16.909 --> 30:18.709
Well, now you're being too kind.

30:18.744 --> 30:19.877
The truth of it is,

30:19.912 --> 30:22.247
I'm a little fucking embarrassed by it all.

30:22.281 --> 30:23.748
I never wanted to be that guy.

30:23.782 --> 30:26.784
I-I didn't imagine myself like that.

30:28.020 --> 30:29.253
How was your dinner?

30:29.287 --> 30:32.423
It was a lot better than
I thought it was gonna be.

30:32.457 --> 30:34.358
All righty, then.

30:34.392 --> 30:35.526
Mm.

30:35.561 --> 30:37.194
- Let's get a real drink.
- All right.

30:37.228 --> 30:38.395
Okay? I think I got something you'll like.

30:38.430 --> 30:39.729
- Come on.
- I like it all.

30:39.764 --> 30:41.065
Hey, it's just me and you, brother

30:41.099 --> 30:43.067
Come on. You gonna leave a tip?

30:43.101 --> 30:45.335
I'm just fucking with
you. Come on. Let's go.

30:48.079 --> 30:51.214
I can't even begin to
tell you how disgusting that is,

30:51.248 --> 30:53.716
your face on the floor.

30:53.750 --> 30:55.384
I don't care.

30:55.418 --> 30:57.720
It's cooler down here. I need some air.

30:57.754 --> 31:00.055
Fucking organisms, bacteria,

31:00.090 --> 31:02.558
the sweat and grime of human crevices...

31:02.593 --> 31:05.227
- Shut the fuck up.
- Fecal matter, all manner of fungus,

31:05.261 --> 31:07.897
spores, dog shit, mice shit.

31:07.931 --> 31:11.066
Dude, I'm not fucking kidding.

31:11.101 --> 31:12.401
I can't do this.

31:12.435 --> 31:14.569
- Yes, you can.
- No.

31:14.604 --> 31:16.405
Champ, we only got a few more hours

31:16.439 --> 31:18.573
before weigh-in.

31:18.608 --> 31:21.576
Why don't you just get
the fuck up off the floor?

31:21.611 --> 31:23.912
Just call garo.

31:23.946 --> 31:26.915
Tell him... I'm not gonna make it.

31:26.949 --> 31:31.085
They can keep half my
purse. I don't fucking care.

31:31.120 --> 31:32.921
Let's...

31:32.955 --> 31:36.090
Let's just sit up for a little while.

31:36.125 --> 31:37.592
Don't fucking touch me.

31:42.631 --> 31:44.432
No.

31:49.171 --> 31:50.638
Oh, shit.

31:50.672 --> 31:51.872
What?

31:51.907 --> 31:54.542
- You've fucking stopped sweating.
- What?

31:54.576 --> 31:55.876
- What the fuck, dude?
- No, dude.

31:55.911 --> 31:57.378
We're good. We're calm. We're good.

31:57.413 --> 31:58.879
We're gonna get you on your feet,

31:58.914 --> 32:00.213
and we're gonna get
you fucking going again.

32:00.248 --> 32:01.549
Come on.

32:01.583 --> 32:03.951
Up, up, up. Come on.

32:03.985 --> 32:06.620
I need some help.

32:06.655 --> 32:07.755
Don't ask me this.

32:07.789 --> 32:10.558
I just need to speed up
the recovery, all right?

32:10.592 --> 32:12.392
I'm not giving you any hgh, Nate.

32:12.427 --> 32:14.561
- Why not?
- Because you're doing fine.

32:14.595 --> 32:17.397
Yeah, but I could be doing better.

32:17.432 --> 32:18.631
And if I don't get it from you,

32:18.666 --> 32:20.067
I'm gonna get it from somebody else.

32:21.902 --> 32:24.538
Look, I just need a push. All right?

32:24.572 --> 32:27.407
- My... my window is closing.
- Bullshit. You're fine.

32:27.442 --> 32:29.242
See, now, that's not how it is, okay?

32:29.277 --> 32:30.910
At... at my level, if you
go this long between fights,

32:30.945 --> 32:33.245
people fucking forget about you overnight.

32:33.280 --> 32:35.247
Okay, I...

32:35.282 --> 32:37.416
I-I need to do everything
I can to get healthy.

32:37.451 --> 32:38.918
Relax.

32:38.953 --> 32:40.687
Mac?

32:40.721 --> 32:42.021
Can you help grab him

32:42.056 --> 32:44.924
and put him on the treadmill
to get him going again?

32:44.959 --> 32:46.926
Get these engines running, bud.

32:46.961 --> 32:48.494
Whoo, hop up. Hands.

32:48.528 --> 32:49.861
What happened?

32:49.896 --> 32:51.863
He just stopped sweating.
We're gonna get him going again.

32:51.898 --> 32:53.532
- I'm good.
- All good.

32:53.567 --> 32:55.201
- I'm all right.
- All good.

32:55.235 --> 32:56.202
Up to 3 1/2?

32:56.236 --> 32:58.036
- Yeah, it's up there.
- It's good.

32:58.071 --> 32:59.938
It's going fast. Go fast.

32:59.973 --> 33:01.440
- You good?
- I'm fine.

33:01.475 --> 33:03.976
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

33:06.212 --> 33:08.346
What is that?

33:08.380 --> 33:09.681
Purple drank.

33:09.716 --> 33:12.183
Double cup will get you double fucked.

33:12.218 --> 33:15.353
- What?
- It's cold medicine and soda.

33:15.387 --> 33:18.523
A guest left a stack
of tabloids by the pool.

33:18.557 --> 33:20.858
I flipped through them,
and I kept seeing rappers

33:20.892 --> 33:22.860
getting in trouble for purple drank,

33:22.894 --> 33:24.362
going nuts on the stuff.

33:24.396 --> 33:27.365
I thought, "well, this shit must be good."

33:27.399 --> 33:30.335
And why should they
have all the fun, right?

33:30.369 --> 33:32.337
Now, I don't know why they do two cups,

33:32.371 --> 33:35.173
but who am I to break from tradition?

33:35.207 --> 33:37.642
- Enjoy.
- All right.

33:37.676 --> 33:41.078
- Salute.
- Salute.

33:41.113 --> 33:42.913
Hmm?

33:47.519 --> 33:49.319
That ain't half bad, man.

33:49.354 --> 33:50.655
Well, it gets better.

33:50.689 --> 33:52.923
See, I got a little sweet
tooth, so this is, uh, perfect.

33:52.958 --> 33:55.925
Purple drank.

33:57.762 --> 34:02.032
You always been in this hotel business?

34:02.066 --> 34:06.603
Ah, no. Sir, I was an RVP for corn nuts.

34:08.306 --> 34:09.773
- I covered the whole southeast.
- Come on.

34:09.806 --> 34:11.440
Big career. Big career, man.

34:11.475 --> 34:12.542
Just...

34:12.576 --> 34:15.712
Man. What happened?

34:15.746 --> 34:18.581
I got too obsessed.

34:18.614 --> 34:21.751
Yeah, yeah, to the point where
I'd walk by a vending machine,

34:21.786 --> 34:23.619
and if I didn't see any corn nuts,

34:23.654 --> 34:25.789
- I'd go ballistic.
- Ohh.

34:25.822 --> 34:27.290
Pretty much killed my second marriage,

34:27.324 --> 34:29.958
but anyhow...

34:29.993 --> 34:32.295
I don't know. I was alone.

34:32.329 --> 34:35.297
And...I said, "the hell with it.

34:35.331 --> 34:37.132
I'm going west."

34:37.167 --> 34:40.135
Came upon this place,
bought it for nothing,

34:40.170 --> 34:43.471
and been running it for
close to now 20 years.

34:43.505 --> 34:45.974
- Wow.
- I know. 20 years.

34:46.009 --> 34:47.076
Man.

34:48.244 --> 34:51.045
I mean, you got a good thing going here.

34:51.081 --> 34:53.882
- Yeah? You think?
- Yeah.

34:53.917 --> 34:55.449
Yeah, it's not without its problems.

34:55.484 --> 34:57.786
No, but, I mean, you know,
you do things your way, right?

34:57.821 --> 34:59.521
You set the rules, people come and go.

34:59.555 --> 35:00.788
That's a beautiful thing.

35:00.823 --> 35:03.124
I think you solved the puzzle.

35:03.158 --> 35:04.559
- Maybe.
- Yeah.

35:04.594 --> 35:06.094
Maybe. Thank you.

35:08.698 --> 35:12.166
Yeah, but, uh, you know,
more often than not,

35:12.201 --> 35:14.836
I'm here alone.

35:14.870 --> 35:16.670
- No kids?
- Three.

35:16.705 --> 35:18.973
With their mom... First marriage.

35:19.007 --> 35:21.776
I don't see them much.

35:22.845 --> 35:25.146
I don't see them much.

35:25.180 --> 35:27.815
Huh.

35:27.850 --> 35:29.984
- More purp?
- Yeah, before I get depressed, man.

35:30.018 --> 35:31.052
Yeah, more purp. Come on.

35:33.388 --> 35:35.522
How you doing, Wheeler?

35:35.557 --> 35:38.325
I thought maybe you'd be at work today.

35:38.360 --> 35:40.461
- I'm sorry. Who are you?
- Mark Dantzler.

35:40.495 --> 35:42.463
He's my parole officer.

35:42.497 --> 35:44.798
I'm in charge of this
young man's transition

35:44.832 --> 35:48.802
back into society.

35:48.836 --> 35:52.973
I told you that I'd be
dropping in at some point.

35:53.007 --> 35:54.975
And guess what.

35:55.009 --> 35:57.844
You're not where you're supposed to be.

35:59.213 --> 36:01.347
I've been talking you
up at my staff meetings,

36:01.382 --> 36:02.816
how you're an example,

36:02.850 --> 36:05.385
you've been doing so great at your job.

36:05.419 --> 36:08.053
Now I got egg on my face.

36:08.088 --> 36:10.556
Okay, Mr. Dantzler, how do we fix this?

36:10.591 --> 36:12.659
He lied to his P.O. that
is a parole violation.

36:12.693 --> 36:14.494
I'm taking him into custody,

36:14.528 --> 36:16.829
and he's going back to prison tonight.

36:16.863 --> 36:21.501
And, I mean, I'm real firm on this.

36:21.535 --> 36:24.003
It's gonna be real hard to...

36:24.037 --> 36:26.839
Persuade me otherwise.

36:28.842 --> 36:34.313
Okay, how much persuasion
were you hoping for?

36:34.347 --> 36:35.981
What do you mean? Money?

36:36.016 --> 36:36.982
Hmm.

36:37.017 --> 36:39.484
No. I'm not interested in that.

36:41.887 --> 36:44.055
Then what do you want?

36:51.964 --> 36:54.933
I want to talk to my parolee.

36:54.967 --> 36:56.134
Alone.

37:04.376 --> 37:06.377
- I'm gonna be right outside.
- Okay.

37:12.917 --> 37:16.887
You ever heard of a...

37:16.921 --> 37:20.391
A salophiliac, Ryan?

37:20.425 --> 37:23.026
No, sir.

37:23.061 --> 37:27.030
Well... I happen to be one.

37:27.065 --> 37:31.368
It means I have a sexual
attraction to, uh...

37:31.402 --> 37:32.635
Salty things.

37:32.670 --> 37:36.306
Sweat, in particular. Men or women.

37:36.341 --> 37:38.475
I'm... I'm not... I'm not finicky.

37:38.509 --> 37:42.012
Just... it's just something that I like.

37:46.817 --> 37:48.752
And it looks like, to me,

37:48.786 --> 37:51.688
that I picked the perfect day to drop by.

38:17.180 --> 38:19.981
I still feel like an animal.

38:20.016 --> 38:22.284
I still have that streak.

38:27.223 --> 38:31.693
Every day's a fucking war. Every day.

38:33.730 --> 38:36.697
Somebody trying to take
something from me, you know?

38:36.732 --> 38:40.367
Challenge me, dominate me,

38:40.402 --> 38:44.371
kill me one way or another.

38:44.406 --> 38:47.374
That's how I feel.

38:47.409 --> 38:50.544
I try to see things differently.

38:50.578 --> 38:53.380
Pills... I...

38:53.415 --> 38:55.549
I read every fucking
show-me-the-way book

38:55.583 --> 38:57.884
I could get my hands
on, including the Bible

38:57.919 --> 39:02.221
and all that easternphilosophy bullshit.

39:02.256 --> 39:04.057
None of it sticks.

39:04.091 --> 39:06.560
No.

39:06.594 --> 39:09.262
I'm hardwired for conflict.

39:16.337 --> 39:19.805
You know, you can't be surprised if they...

39:19.840 --> 39:21.140
Don't...

39:23.510 --> 39:26.479
Hey, man. Degranzo.

39:26.513 --> 39:28.647
- Degran...
- What the fuck you doing, man?

39:28.682 --> 39:30.983
Man. Get the fuck out of here.

39:31.017 --> 39:34.186
- Get the fuck out of here.
- No.

39:44.798 --> 39:47.732
I'm gonna get the fuck out of here.

39:50.490 --> 39:51.599
One pound under.

39:52.203 --> 39:53.837
- Nice.
- Excellent work.

39:53.872 --> 39:54.938
Beautiful.

39:54.973 --> 39:55.939
Yeah, buddy.

39:57.872 --> 39:59.539
Get on there.

40:11.185 --> 40:12.652
Two pounds under.

40:13.854 --> 40:15.955
We did it. What did I say?

40:15.990 --> 40:17.456
That you'd do it, and you fucking did it.

40:17.491 --> 40:18.457
Thank you, brother.

40:18.492 --> 40:19.793
Great... Let's get to the arena,

40:19.827 --> 40:21.127
make it official, huh?

40:21.162 --> 40:24.130
We're leaving in five.

40:25.499 --> 40:26.999
Hurry up.

40:29.369 --> 40:30.503
Yeah.

40:30.537 --> 40:33.339
Hey, Lis? Hey.

40:33.373 --> 40:36.342
Is Alvey gonna make it to the fight?

40:36.376 --> 40:37.343
I hope so.

40:42.015 --> 40:45.483
You think this was some
kind of victory for you?

40:45.518 --> 40:48.486
Well, I'm here. He's not.

40:48.521 --> 40:50.989
- Right.
- Wait, wait, wait. Lis, Lis.

40:51.024 --> 40:51.990
I'm j... I'm just...

40:52.025 --> 40:53.158
You don't know what these days are like.

40:53.193 --> 40:55.727
I'm... I'm... It's hard.

40:55.761 --> 40:57.696
- You lost weight. You didn't go to war.
- All right, I'm shutting up.

40:57.730 --> 40:59.364
I don't know what's going on with him.

40:59.398 --> 41:01.065
You're obviously upset about something.

41:01.099 --> 41:03.067
Oh, right, 'cause you're
the rational one here.

41:04.303 --> 41:06.938
I'm sorry. Can we just
please go to the weigh-in

41:06.972 --> 41:08.306
before I slip into a coma?

41:08.341 --> 41:09.507
Sure. Yeah, no,

41:09.542 --> 41:11.843
is there anything else
that I can do for you?

41:11.877 --> 41:13.745
Any way I can make you feel better?

41:13.779 --> 41:15.579
I just want to know

41:15.613 --> 41:16.848
if Alvey's coming to the fight, lis.

41:16.882 --> 41:18.349
- I don't know!
- Okay, okay.

41:18.383 --> 41:21.385
I'm not fucking responsible for him or you.

41:21.419 --> 41:23.221
I'm just trying to make this place work.

41:23.255 --> 41:24.822
Now, put on a Navy St. t-shirt

41:24.857 --> 41:26.490
and shut the fuck up.

41:51.949 --> 41:55.085
You've reached Alvey Kulina.
Please leave a message.

41:56.620 --> 42:00.090
Hey, dad, I just, uh...

42:00.124 --> 42:03.926
I just wanted to call
and give you an update.

42:03.960 --> 42:10.600
The, um... the weigh-in's
at 9:00, so, um...

42:10.634 --> 42:14.604
So we're gonna be leaving in a few minutes.

42:14.638 --> 42:16.639
Uh...

42:19.476 --> 42:21.777
Ryan made weight.

42:21.811 --> 42:24.280
It was fucking brutal,

42:24.314 --> 42:29.952
but he bitched and moaned
and pushed through, so...

42:29.986 --> 42:34.123
So everything is on schedule.

42:34.157 --> 42:36.292
And I made weight.

42:36.326 --> 42:37.659
Yeah.

42:40.362 --> 42:44.165
Uh, I saw Nate sparring today.

42:44.199 --> 42:46.334
Looked pretty good.

42:46.368 --> 42:48.870
He's a little gimpy, but, uh...

42:50.740 --> 42:53.741
But I think he's gonna be back soon.

42:56.711 --> 43:00.181
Yeah, so that's, uh...

43:00.215 --> 43:03.952
That's the good news.

43:03.986 --> 43:07.288
I hope you're hearing this.

43:07.323 --> 43:09.123
I don't know where you are.

43:12.060 --> 43:15.028
But I hope you're all right.

43:45.493 --> 43:48.260
Hey.

43:53.166 --> 43:54.801
Where are you?

43:54.835 --> 43:58.471
I'm at the sunset Hawaiian.

43:58.506 --> 43:59.972
It's, uh...

44:00.007 --> 44:02.508
You know, it's east somewhere.

44:05.445 --> 44:07.079
You alone?

44:07.114 --> 44:10.449
Yeah.

44:13.453 --> 44:16.287
You're really scaring me, Alvey.

44:20.359 --> 44:22.828
Can I come get you?

44:22.862 --> 44:29.167
Lisa, I need to... I
need to know something.

44:29.201 --> 44:31.369
You still love me?

44:56.483 --> 44:59.483
