14:46.302 --> 14:47.302
There was...

14:48.388 --> 14:49.972
There was a time

14:50.139 --> 14:51.640
when people had a

14:51.975 --> 14:54.518
notion of time and a place.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.853
The sense of decorum of

14:56.938 --> 14:58.480
what should or shouldn't be said.

14:59.649 --> 15:01.400
Shit. Sorry, I...

15:03.987 --> 15:04.987
You're sad.

15:07.156 --> 15:08.156
I'm not sad.

15:08.324 --> 15:09.575
It's really not a big deal if you are.

15:09.659 --> 15:11.368
Honestly, doesn't matter to me. I'm...

15:11.911 --> 15:14.329
I'm not uncomfortable with emotion.
Not that kinda guy.

15:15.164 --> 15:16.248
You think, that's a generational thing?

15:16.332 --> 15:18.000
Being, like, uncomfortable with emotion?

15:18.084 --> 15:20.168
'Cause, like, your generation's so stoic.

15:20.545 --> 15:22.504
Like, you could have lost
11 buddies in Nam

15:22.589 --> 15:24.469
but, you'd only cry
if the camera crews show up.

15:24.507 --> 15:26.947
I always thought that was hilarious,
like the families must...

15:27.176 --> 15:28.552
Be like, now he cries.

15:28.636 --> 15:31.805
30 years we have grim, stoic,
drinking problem Dad.

15:31.889 --> 15:34.891
Now we got Tom Hanks here,
and he's like, crying in our scotch.

15:35.852 --> 15:36.852
It's hilarious.

and there's some pills in the...

15:47.405 --> 15:48.947

18:39.410 --> 18:40.410
Kid.

18:59.514 --> 19:00.972
JUNE: So nice to meet you.

19:01.057 --> 19:03.767
ASHBY: I should have come over earlier
and introduced myself.

19:03.851 --> 19:05.352
Welcome you to the block.

19:05.770 --> 19:07.813
That's so sweet. No, not at all.

19:07.897 --> 19:10.732
I've been so busy anyway
trying to learn the neighborhood.

19:10.858 --> 19:12.734
I'm in real estate and I keep getting lost.

19:12.902 --> 19:15.445
Bit embarrassing trying to show a client

19:15.530 --> 19:17.489
a beautiful Georgian and then instead

19:17.573 --> 19:19.449
bringing them to a crack house.

19:20.618 --> 19:22.202
Sure you'll get the hang of it.

- Ed.

19:24.789 --> 19:27.332
I've got a doctor's appointment in town.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.216
I was hoping, maybe,
you could drive me there.

19:29.293 --> 19:30.502
Of course he can.

19:30.586 --> 19:32.506
I promise,
I'll get him back for his school work.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.673
He's told me how much
his studies mean to him.

19:34.757 --> 19:36.925
Oh, really? More than he's told me.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.219
You know how boys like to keep secrets.

19:41.597 --> 19:44.057
Well, so, shall we go then?

19:44.267 --> 19:45.767
Ed, you don't need that umbrella.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.310
We're are not in Oregon anymore.

19:47.770 --> 19:50.146
- Okay.
- Okay, we'll see you later.

ED: Hey, so...

20:06.038 --> 20:07.664
Where... Where is your doctor?

20:09.792 --> 20:12.460
We both know
there's no doctor's appointment, Ed.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.047
Uh...

20:16.424 --> 20:17.799
So...

20:18.634 --> 20:20.635
Where am I taking you, then?

20:22.346 --> 20:24.222
Well, I thought
I might take you deep into the woods

20:24.307 --> 20:25.974
and put a bullet in your head.

20:26.267 --> 20:27.309
Ashby, I'm so sorry.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.833
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean
to see anything. I'm really sorry.

20:30.855 --> 20:31.938
You know what I am.

20:32.565 --> 20:33.899
I won't tell anyone. I promise.

20:33.983 --> 20:35.817
- I won't tell anyone.
- How do I know?

20:36.819 --> 20:39.154
I know there's only one way
I know to silence a man.

20:39.405 --> 20:41.031
Oh, Jesus! Jesus Christ.

20:41.782 --> 20:43.325
- Don't blasphemy, Ed.
- Shit!

20:43.701 --> 20:44.701
That's better.

20:44.869 --> 20:45.952
Shit.

20:46.162 --> 20:47.162
Did you tell anybody?

20:47.204 --> 20:48.204

- Did you tell anybody?
- No.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.083

- I don't have any friends.

20:52.168 --> 20:53.793
Ask anyone, I don't have any friends.

20:54.170 --> 20:56.546
- Your girlfriend?
- No, now you're just mocking me.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.381

And, this is it, Ed.

21:07.516 --> 21:08.767
I want you to promise me.

21:09.685 --> 21:12.187
That you won't
put any of this crap in your report.

I promise you,
I won't put any of this stuff in the report.

Where do you want me to look?

Okay, I just...

- Look at my face, Ed.
- I just don't want you to kill me...

Okay.

This is really interesting for me.

I like history. You know, I like the past.

22:12.748 --> 22:13.748
Why's that?

'Cause the present sucks.

I won't tell anyone, I promise.

(SOFTLY) You killed 93 people, 93?

22:40.943 --> 22:44.654
Was there an assignment?
Did they assign you a killing?

22:44.739 --> 22:46.364
You work as a team.

22:46.449 --> 22:52.037
I would execute the requests,
and they gave me assignments.

22:52.121 --> 22:53.121
They give you a dossier?

22:53.164 --> 22:56.666
No. You get a name, an address or two,

22:56.792 --> 22:58.209

22:58.294 --> 23:02.047
Wait, so you didn't even know
why you were whacking someone?

They were a threat to our country,
to our national security.

and why you were killing them.

obsessed with my house.

29:55.878 --> 29:58.713
I was just coming over...

30:00.883 --> 30:01.883
- (COUGHS)
- (CHUCKLES)

30:02.050 --> 30:03.801
Listen, do you have
the history assignment?

30:03.886 --> 30:04.886
I do.

30:05.554 --> 30:07.263
Do you still need it?
Because there's a rumor going around

30:07.347 --> 30:08.723
that you turned into a jock.

30:09.308 --> 30:12.268
I assume you'll turn back
into a pumpkin at midnight though.

30:12.686 --> 30:16.063
Probably. I'm in.

30:16.356 --> 30:17.482
Seems weird.

30:17.566 --> 30:18.566
No, it's not weird.

30:20.486 --> 30:22.778
You realize I need to see your brain now.

30:22.863 --> 30:23.988
Really? I'd be honored.

30:24.072 --> 30:25.406
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure.

30:27.951 --> 30:28.951
Music?

30:29.495 --> 30:30.536
You got any Pilgrim?

30:30.621 --> 30:32.288
Of course.

30:35.876 --> 30:37.376

30:47.930 --> 30:49.764
My mom is dead, if you were wondering.

30:51.266 --> 30:55.436
She had a cerebral hemorrhage
which is a bit like an IED in your brain.

30:56.647 --> 30:58.773
She was standing in line at
The Cheesecake Factory one day

30:58.857 --> 31:00.733
and boom.

31:07.032 --> 31:08.115
Where were you?

31:09.535 --> 31:11.619
Standing in line
at The Cheesecake Factory.

31:14.414 --> 31:16.749
My dad really took it hard.

31:16.833 --> 31:19.001
They were really in love.

31:19.086 --> 31:20.836
Not like most people
who say they're in love

31:20.921 --> 31:23.756
but then really never see each other.

31:23.840 --> 31:27.051
They were loyal and tight and...

31:27.177 --> 31:28.177
Like they saw each other brighter

31:28.262 --> 31:30.054
than anything else in the whole world.

31:34.142 --> 31:35.142
He mostly works now.

31:39.982 --> 31:42.692
My neighbor killed people for the CIA.

31:42.818 --> 31:43.818
Wow. Really?

31:45.153 --> 31:46.529
I would love to see his brain.

31:47.823 --> 31:49.448
What's he like?

31:49.825 --> 31:50.908
He's strange.

31:50.993 --> 31:52.910
He wears, like, really funny clothes

31:52.995 --> 31:57.999
and he has all these tattoos
but not, like, hipster tattoos.

31:58.083 --> 32:02.169
He has tattoos that I'm pretty sure
he got in a Russian prison.

32:02.337 --> 32:04.338
- (CHUCKLES)
- I actually really like him.

32:04.464 --> 32:08.759
But I found out that he killed 93 people.

32:10.512 --> 32:12.555
Lot of blood on two little hands.

32:13.557 --> 32:14.557
Who said that?

32:15.309 --> 32:16.309
Me.

32:17.019 --> 32:19.353
Really? Sounded like you were quoting.

32:20.022 --> 32:22.773
Yeah, well, I do that sometimes.

32:22.983 --> 32:25.109
So people will put my sayings
out into the lexicon,

32:25.193 --> 32:27.028
- thereby rendering me...
- Immortal?

32:27.487 --> 32:28.487
Exactly.

32:34.536 --> 32:35.536
You're pretty strange.

32:37.289 --> 32:38.289
How so?

32:40.000 --> 32:41.667
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

32:55.057 --> 32:56.974
All right, well.

32:58.018 --> 33:00.936
Guess... Guess that's it.

33:02.189 --> 33:03.189
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

33:04.691 --> 33:06.734
Sign here. Just kidding.

33:09.571 --> 33:10.571
All right.

33:21.416 --> 33:22.416
Ow!

33:24.002 --> 33:25.920
You're not coming to practice tomorrow.

33:27.255 --> 33:28.255
You get that?

33:29.925 --> 33:31.842
- Huh?
- Mmm-hmm.

33:46.525 --> 33:47.525
Hey.

33:48.819 --> 33:49.819
Howdy?

33:50.570 --> 33:51.570
(KEYS JANGLING)

33:51.697 --> 33:52.697
Let's go.

33:54.700 --> 33:55.700
Where are we going?

33:57.577 --> 33:58.869
ASHBY: He died for this.

34:01.623 --> 34:02.623
You okay? What are you...

34:03.458 --> 34:04.709
You gonna buy something?

34:04.793 --> 34:06.544
Let's just get out of here.

34:07.879 --> 34:11.549
Wow.
Somebody's really chatty today, isn't he?

34:14.344 --> 34:16.679
Would you like
an ice cream or something?

34:17.681 --> 34:18.806
What? No.

34:23.478 --> 34:24.478
Let's go.

34:30.652 --> 34:31.652
Is this a cassette?

34:31.737 --> 34:33.237
I've literally
never seen a cassette before.

34:33.321 --> 34:34.362
I've only heard about it.

34:35.657 --> 34:36.657
Does it work?

34:38.618 --> 34:39.618
Left here.

34:39.911 --> 34:41.245
Who's Peter Frampton?

34:41.329 --> 34:43.038
Slow down. Right here.

34:43.581 --> 34:44.623
ED: Can I know where we're going?

34:44.708 --> 34:45.708
ASHBY: To visit a friend.

34:46.293 --> 34:47.493
ED: What're you doing, really?

34:48.003 --> 34:49.170
You're gonna see a girl?

34:51.047 --> 34:52.726
- No.
- Did you get all dressed up for her?

34:53.257 --> 34:55.467
- I won't be long.
- It's a nice vest. You look nice.

35:22.954 --> 35:23.954
Look.

35:24.539 --> 35:25.664
Like a ghost.

35:26.374 --> 35:28.417
- Ashby.
- Pete.

35:28.668 --> 35:29.794
I didn't hear the bell.

35:30.545 --> 35:32.379
- No. I didn't ring it.
- Oh. (CHUCKLES)

35:32.839 --> 35:33.839
Of course.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.008
You want some lemonade?

35:37.552 --> 35:38.552
Or a whiskey?

35:39.679 --> 35:42.056
It's early in the day,
but late in the life, right?

35:43.058 --> 35:44.058
(SIGHS)

35:47.062 --> 35:48.145
Garret Hughes.

35:52.901 --> 35:53.901
What about him?

35:55.487 --> 35:57.613
He wasn't an enemy
of the state, was he?

35:59.366 --> 36:02.827
He was an enemy
of the state of my bank balance.

36:03.078 --> 36:04.537
Jesus Christ, Peter.

36:04.663 --> 36:06.330
Look. Come on, Ashby.

36:06.414 --> 36:09.083
Are you getting squeamish now
after all you did?

36:09.626 --> 36:10.668
We did?

36:11.628 --> 36:14.421
I was meant to do it,
but I got stuck on that Honduras thing.

36:14.923 --> 36:15.965
You used me.

36:16.049 --> 36:19.385
In our world, it's an office prank, Ash.

36:20.136 --> 36:21.762
Are you mad about the money?

36:21.888 --> 36:23.597
You want a piece? I'll cut you in.

36:23.723 --> 36:25.850
I'll cut you a check
and we'll have a whiskey.

36:25.934 --> 36:28.143
I'd love to reminisce.
We'll have some dinner.

36:28.228 --> 36:30.771
Marjorie's in Florida.
So, you don't get to see her pretty...

Hey, I made the football team.

37:23.199 --> 37:25.910
- (LAUGHS) Congratulations.
- Thanks.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.578
- That's great.
- Thanks.

37:28.246 --> 37:31.248
What happened?
They forgot to give you a helmet?

37:31.458 --> 37:32.458
Uh...

37:32.542 --> 37:34.877
This kid took umbrage at my presence.

37:34.961 --> 37:36.670
'Cause he thinks I'm gonna take his spot.

37:38.089 --> 37:40.174
Well, I hope you got a few punches in.

37:40.592 --> 37:42.843
No, I kind of have
a pacifist view of these things.

37:43.553 --> 37:45.346
I just think, violence begets violence.

37:46.431 --> 37:47.711
Well, let me tell you something.

37:47.849 --> 37:50.184
Beatings begets bruises.

37:50.310 --> 37:53.270
Trust me. More beatings.

37:53.939 --> 37:56.690
Hey, you wouldn't kill him for me,
would you?

37:59.027 --> 38:01.028
Would you just kill him for me?

38:02.322 --> 38:03.489
I'm retired.

38:04.074 --> 38:05.199
That's a shame.

38:07.953 --> 38:09.870
But, the thing is
I proved to myself that I can do it,

38:09.955 --> 38:11.080
which is all I really wanted to do.

38:11.164 --> 38:12.414
And I'm just happy
that I made the football team.

38:12.499 --> 38:15.709
I don't even need to, actually, be on it.

38:15.835 --> 38:19.463
I really do have a big workload
and SAT's to think about.

38:19.547 --> 38:21.966
I'm really focusing on trying
to get into Northwestern.

38:22.384 --> 38:23.504
Where did you go to college?

38:24.886 --> 38:26.046
So you're going to just quit?

38:27.138 --> 38:29.264
I dunno. I mean,
I have to balance up my pros and cons

38:29.349 --> 38:30.516
and look at my goals.

38:30.600 --> 38:31.642
Let me ask you something.

38:31.726 --> 38:32.726
Yeah.

38:32.811 --> 38:38.649
Is one of your goals
to bullshit yourself into submission?

38:40.986 --> 38:42.444
You know, I don't have to drive you.

38:44.406 --> 38:47.741
Oh, I know. Hey, I'm grateful. Okay?

38:48.034 --> 38:49.076
Okay.

38:49.953 --> 38:52.037
And I'm gonna repay you right now.

38:54.874 --> 38:56.594
Wait, you're going to
teach me how to fight?

38:57.419 --> 38:59.044
I ain't got that much time left.

39:00.588 --> 39:01.588
What then?

39:02.424 --> 39:05.300
If you're going to be a pacifist

39:05.385 --> 39:07.928
and an irritating personality type,

39:08.013 --> 39:10.431
then you can at least learn
how to take a punch,

39:10.515 --> 39:13.976
as you'll, no doubt,
have to be taking many.

39:18.273 --> 39:19.713
- Put 'em up.
- That's lovely, but...

39:19.941 --> 39:21.650
Ow! Jesus!

39:21.776 --> 39:22.901
- Stings a little.
- Why did...

39:22.986 --> 39:24.820
I didn't think you were
actually gonna do it.

39:24.946 --> 39:26.947

All right. Don't be a bitch.

39:27.032 --> 39:28.032

- Relax. Just focus.

39:30.285 --> 39:31.869
I'm not relaxed.
I'm not gonna focus. Okay?

39:31.953 --> 39:34.163
You're hitting me in the face.
How's that supposed to make me relax?

39:34.247 --> 39:36.915
Ow! Jesus! I'm gonna
hit you back, old man.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
I doubt that.

39:39.627 --> 39:40.961
Are you gonna quit the team, huh?

39:43.298 --> 39:45.382
There you go.
Now you're feeling it. Come on.

39:47.052 --> 39:48.552
Yeah, how does that feel?

39:48.678 --> 39:50.262
Felt good to me. Come on, bring it.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.814
Oh, shit. Shit. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

40:01.649 --> 40:02.649
That's all right.

That's good.

that you did not know you had.

42:51.236 --> 42:53.111
You will feel a spirit inside of you,

42:53.196 --> 42:55.656
that you did not know you possessed.

42:55.949 --> 42:59.034
- And you will fly.
- On wings.

43:00.995 --> 43:03.956
And you will see a glow,

43:04.582 --> 43:06.959
descend on the field.

43:07.919 --> 43:08.919
And in that glow,

43:09.003 --> 43:13.966
will be the spirits of these boys,
of these men.

43:14.050 --> 43:15.425

43:15.510 --> 43:20.347
if you have the courage
and the heart to be carried.

43:22.350 --> 43:24.142

43:30.275 --> 43:32.818
if you are a piece of chewable candy,

43:33.361 --> 43:35.737
then this game will spit you out.

43:35.863 --> 43:39.866
The chewable,
rancid nothing that you are.

a spirit inside of you, carrying you.

And three,

- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, baby.

57:33.826 --> 57:35.451
- You okay?
- Yeah.

57:35.536 --> 57:36.869
Yeah. I...

57:39.581 --> 57:40.790
Got stood up.

57:42.543 --> 57:44.418
I sat there at the restaurant like a...

57:46.630 --> 57:47.630
I don't know.

57:47.714 --> 57:49.757
A homeless guy
tried to pick me up on the way home.

57:49.842 --> 57:51.300
So, that was great,

57:51.718 --> 57:54.470
or embarrassing, humiliating, weird.

57:54.888 --> 57:55.888
Very sweet.

57:56.765 --> 57:58.182
I'm sorry, Mom. Just, you know...

58:01.228 --> 58:02.228
Hello.

58:03.814 --> 58:04.856
Hi, Jerry.

58:06.233 --> 58:07.775
I am. I...

58:08.652 --> 58:10.987
(CHUCKLES) Yes, I would love to.

58:12.739 --> 58:13.823
I'll see you then.

58:14.074 --> 58:15.074
Buh-bye.

58:16.410 --> 58:18.578
Wow. One door closes, huh?

58:18.996 --> 58:20.413
I think he's nice.

58:22.666 --> 58:23.666
You okay?

58:24.001 --> 58:25.251
How's Ashby?

58:30.299 --> 58:31.299
Ed?

58:36.597 --> 58:37.638
You're not like an
asshole who's touching

58:37.723 --> 58:39.390
my son's privates, are you?

58:39.474 --> 58:41.684
(CHUCKLES) No, I'm not.

58:43.395 --> 58:45.104
You're a good guy, right? I mean...

58:46.023 --> 58:47.023
Just...

58:48.942 --> 58:50.067
Don't let him down.

58:53.572 --> 58:55.323
Who the hell can promise that?

59:04.625 --> 59:05.625
What're you doing?

59:06.543 --> 59:09.143
- What were you doing over there?
- I thought something was wrong.

59:09.213 --> 59:10.463
I... He's...

59:11.173 --> 59:13.007
- He's not touching you, is he?
- Jesus Christ, Mom!

59:13.091 --> 59:14.967
No, he's not touching me.
Stay out of my life, okay?

59:15.052 --> 59:16.052
I stay out of your...

59:17.638 --> 59:18.638

59:18.680 --> 59:21.224
(STUTTERS) My sexcapades?

59:21.308 --> 59:22.391
- Yeah.
- What is that?

59:22.476 --> 59:23.476
Is that...

59:23.977 --> 59:25.645
Wait, I'm a slut, is that what you think?

59:25.729 --> 59:27.897
No. No, no.
I'm not saying that you're a slut.

59:27.981 --> 59:29.482
I go on dates, Ed.

59:29.566 --> 59:31.567
I'd like to find love, if that's all right.

59:31.652 --> 59:33.736
And if I have to
kiss a lot of frogs to do it...

59:33.820 --> 59:35.321
Okay, but do you have to fuck 'em?

59:38.242 --> 59:39.533
I like sex.

59:39.660 --> 59:40.910
Okay, Mom. That's enough. Thank you.

59:40.994 --> 59:42.245
No, it's not enough.

59:42.329 --> 59:43.579
I'm not done with you.

59:43.664 --> 59:45.164
I'm a sexual being.

59:45.791 --> 59:47.375
I enjoy having sex.

They're assholes, Mom.
They're assholes.

59:49.836 --> 59:50.920
None of them deserve you.

59:52.130 --> 59:53.464
Okay? They don't deserve you.

I know. But, I...

59:54.925 --> 59:56.300
Mom, they don't.

59:57.344 --> 59:58.664
I don't see how you don't see it.

59:58.929 --> 01:00:00.346
- I do see that.
- You don't see it.

01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:04.809
I've got to try.

01:00:07.354 --> 01:00:09.105
I'm also going inside.

- Give it to him. Give it to him!

- Really?
- He's just a pansy, man.

and then turn it up the field!

are wondering why

01:00:42.514 --> 01:00:46.058
I dressed you heartless cockroaches
in the uniform of greats!

Coach Wally, I think
we need some tests.

who here has grown a vagina.

and know who he is.

01:01:09.291 --> 01:01:10.291
Give me that.

- Where to?

01:01:59.132 --> 01:02:01.258
to get an interim look at your heads.

pre-season, etcetera, etcetera.

Go ahead, and then we can
use your brain scans

- What?
- Ed, honey...

01:04:23.735 --> 01:04:25.611
Consider the weirdness
of what you're doing.

My Mom's had a really rough time.

01:04:27.239 --> 01:04:31.033
And my Dad, he was an asshole.

And I just really don't want
that to happen again.

your intentions, 'cause...

She's not a good-time Gussie.

Good-time Gussie?

01:04:41.962 --> 01:04:43.212
Ed... Don't worry about it.

01:04:43.296 --> 01:04:45.256
No, no. It's okay.

01:04:47.175 --> 01:04:49.468
Well, I was waiting for...

01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:51.971
I didn't wanna rush anything.

01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:55.099
I know, she's dating other people.

01:04:55.642 --> 01:04:58.978
But, I'm falling for...

01:05:00.063 --> 01:05:02.690
I have fallen for your Mom.

to tell you on a picnic.

01:05:06.361 --> 01:05:08.241
- Does that freak you out?
- No, I love picnics.

01:05:11.491 --> 01:05:12.533
I should go.

01:05:14.494 --> 01:05:15.536
See ya.

I'm hungry. I want...

I want pancakes at...

Fuckers keep losing.

01:06:41.748 --> 01:06:42.998
It's been pointed out.

01:06:50.423 --> 01:06:53.050
You look miserable when you play.
You look like, you're...

01:06:54.719 --> 01:06:56.095
You're afraid of getting hit.

01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:00.349
You came and watched me play?

01:07:05.438 --> 01:07:07.189
Go, wait in the car.
I'm gonna go get my pills.

01:07:07.273 --> 01:07:08.816
We'll take a ride.

01:07:11.778 --> 01:07:13.445
Feel free to clean up this mess.

01:07:21.621 --> 01:07:22.621
Hey.

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:25.753
I'm sorry about what I said
about your daughter.

01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:27.459
(LAUGHS SADLY)

01:07:28.253 --> 01:07:29.545
Well, you were wrong anyway.

01:07:29.629 --> 01:07:32.214
It was Spain. I was in Spain.

01:07:36.136 --> 01:07:37.636
You know, when she was...

01:07:40.974 --> 01:07:44.435
When she was 19, she was...

01:07:44.602 --> 01:07:45.811
She was troubled.

01:07:45.979 --> 01:07:47.730
She...

01:07:49.482 --> 01:07:50.899
She couldn't find her place.

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:55.863
Years and time went by,
she just needed me to hold her hand.

01:07:56.406 --> 01:07:58.198
You know, like when she was little.

01:07:59.033 --> 01:08:00.576
You know, she used to...

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:04.663
Just hold on to my hand
and she'd grip it really tight.

01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:10.919
And she looked at me with,
with them, with them eyes that...

01:08:12.839 --> 01:08:16.008
That thanked me
for knowing how to keep her safe.

01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:21.513
Maybe she

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:25.434
looked around for me like that,

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:29.020
and I wasn't there.

01:08:30.689 --> 01:08:33.024
I was off in South America and

01:08:33.443 --> 01:08:35.903
Panama, Nicaragua, you know,

01:08:37.029 --> 01:08:38.654
doing my thing.

01:08:40.116 --> 01:08:42.117
Putting a bullet in a man's head.

01:08:48.249 --> 01:08:50.042
Is that why you wanna
get to heaven so bad?

01:08:51.002 --> 01:08:52.877
I have to see her. I have to...

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:55.546
I have to make it right.

01:09:04.224 --> 01:09:05.224
(ENGINE STARTS)

01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:26.828
But she's, she's not my girlfriend, okay?
She's just...

01:09:28.081 --> 01:09:30.415
It's, it's ambiguous, but even so,

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.792
it's turned into a fucking disaster.

I've been eating dinner.

01:20:51.138 --> 01:20:52.764
There, it's...

01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:58.811
Well, okay.

01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:02.398
Can't we do this in the church?

01:21:02.483 --> 01:21:05.193
No, no.
We're fumigating the church for roaches.

01:21:05.277 --> 01:21:06.736
The fuckers are everywhere.

01:21:08.948 --> 01:21:10.657
Can you at least put your collar on?

01:21:11.408 --> 01:21:16.079
Yeah, sure, yeah.
Help yourself to wings, whatever.

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:32.220
Father.

01:21:34.265 --> 01:21:36.140
I've killed 95 men.

01:21:37.476 --> 01:21:38.476
Um...

01:21:39.812 --> 01:21:42.355
You, you... I'm sorry, you what?

01:21:44.233 --> 01:21:46.109
Am I gonna have to repeat myself a lot?

01:21:46.777 --> 01:21:51.906
I have taken
the lights outta 95, maybe, 96...

01:21:51.991 --> 01:21:53.658
I don't know the count.

01:21:53.742 --> 01:21:56.953
Do you need to
have the exact numbers of every...

01:21:57.037 --> 01:22:00.039
Of everyone I've killed to absolve me?

01:22:00.791 --> 01:22:01.791
Um...

01:22:02.209 --> 01:22:04.669
No, I think a

01:22:04.753 --> 01:22:08.214
blanket absolution is, is possible.

01:22:08.299 --> 01:22:09.632
One of them, I know was wrong.

01:22:09.717 --> 01:22:11.134
- One of them?
- Yeah.

01:22:14.471 --> 01:22:18.808
You can't ask for forgiveness
for all of it unless you're truly sorry.

01:22:22.438 --> 01:22:25.189
Well, I didn't...
I didn't see that coming. I...

01:22:25.608 --> 01:22:27.609
You've taken human lives.

01:22:27.776 --> 01:22:30.945
I mean, evil triumphs
when good men do nothing.

01:22:31.947 --> 01:22:33.031
You thought that you were doing good?

01:22:33.115 --> 01:22:34.157
Yeah.

01:22:34.742 --> 01:22:35.867
Yes.

01:22:37.995 --> 01:22:39.954
I was... I was...

01:22:40.039 --> 01:22:42.165
I might've been wrong, I suppose.

01:22:42.249 --> 01:22:44.834
Don't you ever think that?
I mean, you never...

01:22:45.377 --> 01:22:47.879
Excuse me, Father, but you
never got your dick sucked, right?

01:22:48.547 --> 01:22:50.131
This, this is not about...

01:22:50.215 --> 01:22:52.216
You thought about it late at night.

01:22:53.093 --> 01:22:54.093
(NERVOUS CHUCKLE)

01:22:54.845 --> 01:22:59.140
Yeah, of course.
How can I not think about that?

01:22:59.224 --> 01:23:00.391
Well.

01:23:02.353 --> 01:23:04.354
Well, it's tough, but I...

01:23:06.690 --> 01:23:08.816
I believed in...

01:23:09.568 --> 01:23:13.279
I believed in something
that I thought was right.

01:23:16.408 --> 01:23:17.575
Me too.

01:23:20.162 --> 01:23:22.538
So... So, are you sorry?

01:23:24.416 --> 01:23:29.087
I'm sorry that
I... I had to live that life.

01:23:30.506 --> 01:23:31.673
No.

01:23:32.883 --> 01:23:34.967
I would've liked to have done
something different.

01:23:35.302 --> 01:23:38.721
You know.
I wanted to be a baseball player.

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:43.559
I wanted to be a writer.

01:23:43.769 --> 01:23:45.186
(BOTH LAUGHING)

01:23:47.773 --> 01:23:49.107
So, Father?

01:23:53.821 --> 01:23:55.780
Can I be forgiven?

01:23:58.617 --> 01:24:01.536
In your heart,
do you think you're a good man?

01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:05.957
I think I've tried. I've really tried.
And um...

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:08.960
I don't know.

01:24:09.336 --> 01:24:11.879
I mean, if I just tried,
I tried to be a good man

01:24:11.964 --> 01:24:15.174
and do my job and...

01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:18.261
Will it be enough?

01:24:21.765 --> 01:24:23.975
I absolve you of all your sins.

01:24:32.317 --> 01:24:33.735
Go in peace.

01:25:08.103 --> 01:25:09.228
Talk to me.

01:25:10.898 --> 01:25:12.690
Talk to me, Ed. What are you gonna do?

01:25:17.863 --> 01:25:19.906
I'll let you die the way you wanna die.

01:25:20.783 --> 01:25:21.783
Okay?

01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:23.493
I am not gonna call the cops.

01:25:26.288 --> 01:25:27.872
You just have to promise me one thing.

01:25:31.919 --> 01:25:36.047
Just, please don't kill that last guy.
Okay, please.

01:25:36.632 --> 01:25:37.965
Just, please don't kill that last guy

01:25:38.050 --> 01:25:40.134
because I will call, I'm gonna call them.

01:25:40.219 --> 01:25:42.970
I will, and I know I should. I...

01:25:46.892 --> 01:25:50.019
I just...
I can't deal with it, I can't fucking...

01:25:54.566 --> 01:25:55.858
I won't kill him.

01:25:56.735 --> 01:25:58.069
Thank you.

01:26:00.531 --> 01:26:01.989
Can I ask you something? Like...

01:26:03.742 --> 01:26:07.745
Did you just use me
to drive you around...

01:26:09.414 --> 01:26:11.082
To do this, or...

01:26:11.333 --> 01:26:12.542
Did you actually... Like...

01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:14.502
Did you even care about me at all?

01:26:19.216 --> 01:26:20.925
I've met a lot of people in my life.

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:26.347
But I never met anybody like you.

01:26:30.352 --> 01:26:31.435
It's been an honor.

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:53.124
Hey, Ashby.

01:26:55.794 --> 01:26:56.836
Just so you know...

01:26:59.590 --> 01:27:01.048
I think what you did was wrong.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.375
(SCATTERED CHATTER)

01:27:39.004 --> 01:27:40.046
Young fella.

01:27:44.843 --> 01:27:45.885
I'll just take that.

01:27:50.349 --> 01:27:52.183
Entwistle, two sugars, right?

01:27:53.393 --> 01:27:55.519
Well, Ashby.

01:27:55.812 --> 01:27:57.146
What a surprise.

01:27:58.065 --> 01:27:59.398
You hear Pete got clipped?

01:28:00.317 --> 01:28:01.359
I did.

01:28:02.527 --> 01:28:04.070
Probably screwed around

01:28:05.197 --> 01:28:06.822
with the wrong guy's wife.

01:28:08.659 --> 01:28:10.201
He didn't deserve to die.

01:28:13.288 --> 01:28:14.747
- Garret Hughes.
- Well...

01:28:14.831 --> 01:28:15.957
What do we know about him? I mean,

01:28:16.041 --> 01:28:17.541
really what do we know about him?

01:28:17.626 --> 01:28:18.918
Maybe he was a pedophile.

01:28:19.002 --> 01:28:21.712
Liked young kids, young boys,
young girls, you don't know.

01:28:21.797 --> 01:28:23.130
What are you, God? You Moses?

01:28:23.215 --> 01:28:25.049
You have a tablet? You have a ledger?

01:28:25.384 --> 01:28:26.717
You know,

01:28:27.219 --> 01:28:29.929
you've always been
a self-righteous prick.

01:28:30.055 --> 01:28:31.305
We kill people.

01:28:31.390 --> 01:28:32.682
That's what we do.

01:28:33.433 --> 01:28:34.517
For our country.

01:28:35.644 --> 01:28:36.644
Bullshit.

01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:38.646
You like killing people.

01:28:38.730 --> 01:28:39.730
We all did.

01:28:40.565 --> 01:28:41.816
He was just another one.

01:28:47.572 --> 01:28:48.864
You remember these?

01:28:50.909 --> 01:28:51.909
Cuba.

01:28:52.077 --> 01:28:53.661
If only Fidel drank tea.

01:29:02.754 --> 01:29:05.756
- I believe freedom needs to be protected.
- (WHEEZING)

01:29:06.883 --> 01:29:08.384
And costs will be borne.

01:29:09.428 --> 01:29:13.723
And scumbags like you will highjack that.

01:29:14.099 --> 01:29:17.268
And just grab it
for a big house and a big pool.

01:29:27.112 --> 01:29:28.612
It's just a green sticker.

01:29:28.864 --> 01:29:29.947
It's not poison.

01:29:31.116 --> 01:29:32.658
I'd love to kill you.

01:29:35.829 --> 01:29:37.955
But I promised somebody I wouldn't.

(CLEARS THROAT)

For the boys of the past
are looking at you

01:30:12.365 --> 01:30:14.325
and thinking to themselves

01:30:14.743 --> 01:30:16.368
"Where are these boys' brains?"

01:30:17.496 --> 01:30:19.455
"Where are these boys' hearts?"

01:30:22.918 --> 01:30:24.502
We need you to think about that.

01:30:32.886 --> 01:30:34.136
Fuck them.

01:30:36.431 --> 01:30:37.431
Excuse me.

01:30:37.682 --> 01:30:38.682
What did you say?

01:30:39.267 --> 01:30:40.267
I said...

stripped the gears anyway.

Well, I guess...

01:35:55.166 --> 01:35:57.543
Be careful of what
and who you believe in.

01:36:01.464 --> 01:36:03.715
Find someone that you love fiercely.

01:36:04.008 --> 01:36:06.093
And who loves you back the same way.

01:36:06.928 --> 01:36:08.178
And you treat them well.
