WEBVTT

00:03.090 --> 00:04.961
Previously onDynasty...I'm sorry. I have a fiancÃ©.

00:05.005 --> 00:06.571
The judge has agreed to
grant bail on the condition

00:06.615 --> 00:07.964
of house arrest.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.226
MICHAEL: We got
a new midfielder in from Cuba.

00:09.270 --> 00:11.011
I was trying to get out
for a long time,

00:11.054 --> 00:12.708
and I needed help.What do they want?

00:14.971 --> 00:17.234
COFFMAN: Your brain cells are
turning against one another,

00:17.278 --> 00:19.454
causing significant
cognitive dysfunction.

00:19.497 --> 00:21.717
I think I need to be
on my own for a while.

00:21.760 --> 00:24.024
Vanessa, I just need you to
sit tight a little while longer.

00:25.242 --> 00:26.896
Someone call 911.

00:26.939 --> 00:28.115
What if I can never see again?

00:45.088 --> 00:46.176
Well, now, that's better.

00:46.220 --> 00:47.786
I know you can't see it,

00:47.830 --> 00:50.093
but it's the start
of a beautiful new day.

00:50.137 --> 00:52.226
I never knew how much
I'd miss the sunrise.

00:52.269 --> 00:54.663
But you're being here
makes all the difference.

00:54.706 --> 00:56.317
Thank you, Father.

00:56.360 --> 00:58.362
It's, uh, only been a week,
and the doctor says

00:58.406 --> 01:00.408
we won't know anything
until the swelling goes down.

01:00.451 --> 01:01.800
Mm-hmm.In the meantime,

01:01.844 --> 01:04.499
I want you to keep
your chin up, okay?Mm-hmm.

01:04.542 --> 01:06.370
We have blueberry muffins
at three o'clock,

01:06.414 --> 01:07.545
eggs at six,
up there in the corner

01:07.589 --> 01:09.286
at 11 o'clock,
we got some OJ, and...

01:09.330 --> 01:10.635
high noon is coffee.

01:10.679 --> 01:12.072
Sugar?JENNINGS:
You think your sweet father

01:12.115 --> 01:14.248
would forget that?

01:14.291 --> 01:15.336
And how's
our patient today?

01:15.379 --> 01:16.728
Keeping my chin up.

01:17.903 --> 01:20.471
Wonderful. Your nurse
should be here any minute.

01:20.515 --> 01:22.430
Nurse? I...
I didn't order a nurse.

01:22.473 --> 01:23.996
Well, I was
just about to tell you.

01:24.040 --> 01:27.261
Cristal talked to some friends
of hers from her therapy days,

01:27.304 --> 01:29.263
and we found someone
who comes highly recommended.Oh, no, no.

01:29.306 --> 01:30.481
I-I don't need a professional.

01:30.525 --> 01:32.092
The only care I need
is from you.
Well,

01:32.135 --> 01:33.528
I'm not gonna be much help
to you if I'm in prison

01:33.571 --> 01:34.616
for murder.

01:34.659 --> 01:36.444
I need time
to prepare for trial.

01:36.487 --> 01:38.446
Blake's been assigned
a judge.

01:38.489 --> 01:40.448
Yeah. Fairbanks.

01:40.491 --> 01:42.145
Son of a bitch
built his reputation

01:42.189 --> 01:43.929
on being tough
on white-collar criminals.

01:43.973 --> 01:46.889
So you're stepmother and I are
working out a plan

01:46.932 --> 01:49.152
to get someone a little bit more
sympathetic on the bench.

01:49.196 --> 01:50.980
Have you considered interviewing
the interns in the office?

01:51.023 --> 01:52.112
They know where
the skeletons are.

01:52.155 --> 01:54.244
Oh. Don't get
overemotional, Adam.

01:54.288 --> 01:55.463
We're on top of it.

01:55.506 --> 01:58.161
You just focus
on getting better.

01:58.205 --> 01:59.510
Mitchell's waiting
for us downstairs.Ah.

01:59.554 --> 02:01.991
I'll have someone
from the staff take care of it.

02:02.034 --> 02:04.907
Don't you go anywhere, Adam.
Nadia will be here soon.

02:06.822 --> 02:08.476
Where are you off to?

02:08.519 --> 02:11.914
Let me guess, you are going
to go find Liam so you can

02:11.957 --> 02:13.611
sing him the soundtrack
to West Side Story.

02:13.655 --> 02:16.353
Oh, no.
I am done with all that.

02:16.397 --> 02:17.572
Liam wants nothing
to do with me,

02:17.615 --> 02:19.617
so I have decided
to get back to business.

02:19.661 --> 02:21.489
That is shockingly mature.

02:21.532 --> 02:23.055
Agreed.So which business?

02:23.099 --> 02:24.840
The record label with Monica,

02:24.883 --> 02:26.276
the media conglomerate
you bought

02:26.320 --> 02:28.235
so you could steal
the publishing company,

02:28.278 --> 02:29.366
or that restaurant you bought

02:29.410 --> 02:30.411
so you didn't have
to stand in line?

02:30.454 --> 02:31.455
The empanadas were worth it.

02:31.499 --> 02:33.153
And maybe you should
worry more

02:33.196 --> 02:35.285
about your own business,
and less about mine.

02:35.329 --> 02:36.504
Yeah, I am worried.

02:36.547 --> 02:38.070
I have a grand opening
coming up,

02:38.114 --> 02:41.335
and there's a shiny plaque
dedicated to a giant homophobe

02:41.378 --> 02:42.684
in the middle of my lobby, so...Mr. Ridley.

02:42.727 --> 02:44.686
LIAM:
Hey.

02:44.729 --> 02:47.079
Liam.

02:47.123 --> 02:48.298
LIAM:
Fallon.

02:48.342 --> 02:51.432
I'm gonna go... anywhere else.

02:52.563 --> 02:54.913
Hey.
Hey.

02:54.957 --> 02:56.698
What are you doing here?

02:56.741 --> 02:58.265
I, uh, wanted to
return your stuff.

02:58.308 --> 03:00.267
At least I think
it's yours.

03:00.310 --> 03:02.225
Ashley said she would
never buy hooker heels,

03:02.269 --> 03:03.966
even if they are
spring runway.

03:04.009 --> 03:05.446
Thank you.

03:05.489 --> 03:07.187
Is that all?
Actually,

03:07.230 --> 03:09.711
I was wondering if you
had any of my stuff.

03:09.754 --> 03:11.408
Like my passport maybe?

03:11.452 --> 03:13.149
I just-- I can't seem
to find it anywhere.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.759
Yes, Liam, I have your stuff.

03:14.803 --> 03:16.587
I have a ton of your stuff,
including your passport.

03:16.631 --> 03:18.372
We were practically
living together.

03:18.415 --> 03:21.113
I just-- I just gave you
my passport?

03:21.157 --> 03:23.246
You asked me
to hold onto it

03:23.290 --> 03:24.856
because you were
constantly losing it.

03:24.900 --> 03:26.467
You were forgetful,
even then.

03:26.510 --> 03:30.601
Plus, we were talking about
taking a big trip together.

03:30.645 --> 03:33.169
I'm sorry.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.997
But do you think
I can get it back?

03:35.040 --> 03:37.434
I will have to
look for it later.

03:37.478 --> 03:39.001
Sorry, my career needs me.

03:39.044 --> 03:43.048
Yeah, that's fine.
Uh, just let me know.

03:49.968 --> 03:51.405
Sorry, I was just showering.

03:51.448 --> 03:52.580
Any updates?

03:52.623 --> 03:54.495
Can I finally
get out of here?Not yet.

03:54.538 --> 03:55.974
The private security firm
hasn't found the guys

03:56.018 --> 03:57.280
who're after you.

03:57.324 --> 04:01.197
But the store finally
restocked gummy bears.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.459
So there's that.

04:02.503 --> 04:03.808
I'm going crazy in here, man.

04:03.852 --> 04:05.114
I feel like I'm in prison.

04:05.157 --> 04:07.334
Prison doesn't look like this.
Trust me.

04:07.377 --> 04:09.205
I-I know you're bored,
especially since you're used to

04:09.249 --> 04:11.033
a more active social life.

04:11.076 --> 04:12.600
But I need you to stay
out of sight

04:12.643 --> 04:13.905
until this is done.

04:13.949 --> 04:15.646
Okay?
Yeah. Okay.

04:15.690 --> 04:19.520
And no posting
on social media.Oh, my God.

04:19.563 --> 04:20.782
Kirby?

04:22.653 --> 04:24.394
I guess you're not thatbored.

04:24.438 --> 04:26.266
And clearly,
you're doing just fine.

04:26.309 --> 04:28.529
I'm sorry, is that
a judgment that I hear?

04:28.572 --> 04:31.314
'Cause you dumped me, remember?

04:31.358 --> 04:32.576
How long has this
been going on?

04:32.620 --> 04:33.751
None of your business.

04:33.795 --> 04:36.493
Actually, Victor is my business.

04:36.537 --> 04:38.147
Our fall opener
is next week,

04:38.190 --> 04:40.802
and I don't need him being
distracted by... booty calls.

04:40.845 --> 04:42.717
You know what?

04:42.760 --> 04:44.632
Save your lectures
for someone who cares.

04:46.634 --> 04:49.027
Gummy bear?

04:53.684 --> 04:56.034
Maybe if you stare
at it hard enough,

04:56.078 --> 04:57.732
it'll just disappear.

04:57.775 --> 04:59.211
You think?

04:59.255 --> 05:01.301
I think you should stop
obsessing about the plaque

05:01.344 --> 05:02.519
and get back to work.

05:02.563 --> 05:03.520
Yeah, but I can't.

05:03.564 --> 05:04.608
Every time I walk past it,

05:04.652 --> 05:05.566
I feel it watching me,

05:05.609 --> 05:07.698
like a homophobic Mona Lisa.

05:07.742 --> 05:10.484
May I suggest that
you focus on the reason

05:10.527 --> 05:13.182
that you accepted the plaque
as a compromise?

05:13.225 --> 05:16.664
You have a redone hotel
that opens in 48 hours.

05:16.707 --> 05:19.884
Have you had a chance to approve
the final party plans yet?

05:19.928 --> 05:21.930
No. Ever since
Hootie canceled,

05:21.973 --> 05:23.671
I just haven't been able
to get back into it.

05:23.714 --> 05:24.846
Well, maybe you should interview

05:24.889 --> 05:26.978
our prospective
new bartender.

05:28.153 --> 05:30.678
Mixologist.

05:30.721 --> 05:32.593
You know what, you're right.

05:32.636 --> 05:34.116
It does happen on occasion.

05:34.159 --> 05:35.596
I sold my soul
for this place,

05:35.639 --> 05:36.684
and this party
better be lit.

05:38.163 --> 05:39.948
Hi.

05:41.993 --> 05:43.430
FALLON:
Wow, it looks like

05:43.473 --> 05:45.693
"bring your unqualified daughter
to work day" in here.

05:45.736 --> 05:47.042
But actually,

05:47.085 --> 05:48.913
it's your lucky day.You're leaving the country?

05:48.957 --> 05:51.307
Hmm, that's a little funny.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.309
What's this?

05:53.353 --> 05:55.311
An offer to buy Femperial.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.531
It is my company,
and I want it back.

05:57.574 --> 05:58.793
This is an insulting offer.

05:58.836 --> 06:00.490
You have more than this
in your change purse.

06:00.534 --> 06:02.623
You paid one dollar
for the company.

06:02.666 --> 06:05.626
You would be making $2 million
on your investment.

06:05.669 --> 06:07.715
Even you can do the
math on that one.I'm sorry,

06:07.758 --> 06:08.803
but I'm not selling.

06:10.152 --> 06:12.720
Fine. I will double the offer.

06:12.763 --> 06:14.939
But only if you get your
outlet-mall stilettos

06:14.983 --> 06:16.201
off my desk.

06:16.245 --> 06:18.726
I told you,
Femperial's not for sale.

06:18.769 --> 06:20.815
Oh, please.
You really think that

06:20.858 --> 06:22.599
running Femperial's
Instagram account

06:22.643 --> 06:25.036
in any way prepared
you to be the CEO

06:25.080 --> 06:26.647
of a major corporation?Of course not.

06:26.690 --> 06:28.953
Which is why I'm
bringing on a new CEO.

06:28.997 --> 06:31.739
But, you know, since I'm
technically still the boss,

06:31.782 --> 06:34.002
and you're trespassing,
I might just call security

06:34.045 --> 06:35.569
and have you escorted
from the building.

06:35.612 --> 06:37.527
Although, I am tempted
to kick you out

06:37.571 --> 06:40.269
with my, uh,
outlet-mall stilettos.

06:40.312 --> 06:44.534
This isn't over,
you conniving little wombat.

07:08.340 --> 07:09.603
Monthly chelation therapy
will mitigate the side effects

07:09.646 --> 07:11.169
of the neurotoxicity.

07:11.213 --> 07:13.084
But it's not a cure.

07:13.128 --> 07:15.260
My advice: take it easy.

07:15.304 --> 07:16.827
Enjoy life while you can.

07:16.871 --> 07:19.047
Because once your cognitive
functions start to diminish,

07:19.090 --> 07:20.265
they don't get any better.

07:20.309 --> 07:22.833
DOMINIQUE:
Hello?

07:22.877 --> 07:26.837
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
you had company.

07:26.881 --> 07:28.883
And I didn't realize
you still had my spare key.

07:28.926 --> 07:30.275
Hmm.Mom, this is Danielle,

07:30.319 --> 07:32.060
my car broker.

07:32.103 --> 07:34.366
You can never have
too many, right?

07:34.410 --> 07:36.412
I hope you mean cars,
and not brokers.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.718
I'll be in touch.

07:41.983 --> 07:46.161
Are you okay?
You look so tired.

07:46.204 --> 07:48.859
Yeah. Just a little
worn down.

07:48.903 --> 07:52.254
Is it work? Because
maybe I can help.

07:52.297 --> 07:55.300
I'm thinking about getting
back into music management.

07:55.344 --> 07:57.607
Okay, since when have you
been in music management?

07:57.651 --> 07:59.391
I was doing it
in New York.

07:59.435 --> 08:02.525
And I know you just
bought a streaming service,

08:02.569 --> 08:04.701
so maybe I could
help you find talent.

08:04.745 --> 08:07.704
No offense, but...

08:07.748 --> 08:10.794
right now, the last thing
I want to talk about is work.

08:10.838 --> 08:12.361
But I'll think about it.

08:12.404 --> 08:15.103
All right?
Of course.

08:15.146 --> 08:16.408
COMPUTER VOICE:
Things are heating up

08:16.452 --> 08:18.541
in the Blake Carrington
murder trial.

08:18.585 --> 08:19.673
Prosecutors have...

08:19.716 --> 08:21.544
Father?It's me.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.372
And Nadia, the nurse
we spoke about.
Oh.

08:23.415 --> 08:24.808
The nurse that I didn't ask for?

08:24.852 --> 08:27.550
Good news: technically,
I'm an orientation

08:27.594 --> 08:29.030
and mobility instructor.Great.

08:29.073 --> 08:30.422
Whatever you are,
I don't need you.

08:30.466 --> 08:32.120
So, I'm sorry that
they wasted your time,

08:32.163 --> 08:33.121
but you're dismissed.

08:33.164 --> 08:35.645
Good luck.

08:35.689 --> 08:37.342
We have a couple of choices
on where to start.

08:37.386 --> 08:39.562
Basic indoor
orientation skills...
Look,

08:39.606 --> 08:41.172
I'll level with you,
Florence Nightingale.

08:41.216 --> 08:43.348
If you just leave now, you'll
save us both a lot of time.

08:43.392 --> 08:44.436
Sorry, but I'm not
going anywhere,

08:44.480 --> 08:45.568
so you may as well
get used to me.

08:45.612 --> 08:46.787
You'll be done
within a week.

08:46.830 --> 08:48.179
In a week,
you'll be wondering

08:48.223 --> 08:49.572
how you lived without me.

08:49.616 --> 08:51.356
SAM:
A cellist?

08:51.400 --> 08:53.228
Are you serious?She's earned quite
a few accolades

08:53.271 --> 08:54.403
with the Atlanta Philharmonic.

08:54.446 --> 08:56.623
And I'm sure her
family's thrilled,

08:56.666 --> 08:58.842
but it sounds boring.
I mean...

08:58.886 --> 09:02.542
Martinis? Boring.
Lobster canapÃ©s? Boring.

09:02.585 --> 09:03.891
Where's the magic?

09:03.934 --> 09:05.588
The sparkle?

09:05.632 --> 09:07.111
None of it is right, Anders.

09:07.155 --> 09:09.070
Sam, the party's tomorrow.

09:09.113 --> 09:11.681
Changing the plans now would be
a radical course of action.

09:11.725 --> 09:14.162
Then let's be radical.
We need to wow everyone.

09:14.205 --> 09:15.903
And right now,
I'm not wowed.

09:15.946 --> 09:17.121
I'm actually un-wowed.

09:18.601 --> 09:21.082
So we're going big.

09:21.125 --> 09:23.867
And because we're restoring the
name the hotel had in the '80s--

09:23.911 --> 09:26.391
La Mirage-- I think we should
lean into that vibe.

09:26.435 --> 09:27.871
You know, embrace
the spectacle.

09:27.915 --> 09:29.917
Kind of like Vegas,
but classier.

09:29.960 --> 09:32.572
I take it you want me
to cancel the cellist?

09:32.615 --> 09:34.617
Uh, yeah, cancel.

09:34.661 --> 09:36.576
This is my coming out
as a real live businessman.

09:36.619 --> 09:37.838
It has to be perfect.

09:37.881 --> 09:40.362
Now, fortunately,
I have an amazing idea.

09:40.405 --> 09:42.756
Ashanti is in town.

09:42.799 --> 09:44.975
So I'm gonna get her
to sing at the party.

09:45.019 --> 09:47.282
Perhaps she'd like
a cellist to open for her.

09:48.631 --> 09:50.067
And people say
you're not funny.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.375
So you're saying there's no way

09:53.418 --> 09:55.159
we can get Femperial
back from Kirby?

09:55.203 --> 09:57.466
I'm saying I haven't
found one yet.

09:57.509 --> 09:58.772
Don't you have, like,
a dream team of lawyers

09:58.815 --> 09:59.947
available to you?

09:59.990 --> 10:01.644
Why did you choose me?

10:01.688 --> 10:04.473
Well, the family lawyers
are a little busy

10:04.516 --> 10:05.822
with my father's
murder trial.

10:05.866 --> 10:08.695
And also, I don't
trust any of them.

10:08.738 --> 10:10.392
So you come to the guy
who sabotaged

10:10.435 --> 10:12.612
your community service garden,
and tried to send you to jail.

10:12.655 --> 10:13.917
That makes sense.

10:13.961 --> 10:15.136
Yeah, I think so.

10:15.179 --> 10:17.312
Look, I'm trying to
handle this discreetly,

10:17.355 --> 10:18.792
because the last thing
I need are rumors

10:18.835 --> 10:20.663
that Fallon Carrington
got duped into selling

10:20.707 --> 10:22.099
her company for a dollar.

10:22.143 --> 10:24.232
Also, I was in a hurry,
and you had an opening.

10:24.275 --> 10:26.974
Well, patience isn't exactly
your strong suit, is it?

10:27.017 --> 10:29.672
No. It'll take a lot more
than lukewarm coffee

10:29.716 --> 10:31.543
for me to show you
my strong suits.

10:35.199 --> 10:38.028
So, how's your fiancÃ©?

10:38.072 --> 10:40.465
Um, nonexistent.

10:40.509 --> 10:44.600
Yes, that chapter is closed, and
the book is back on the shelf.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.297
Got it.

10:46.341 --> 10:49.387
Well, uh, maybe we could
grab a drink sometime,

10:49.431 --> 10:50.954
or some scalding
hot coffee.

10:50.998 --> 10:52.390
Well, I would like that.

10:52.434 --> 10:54.044
But let's just maybe see

10:54.088 --> 10:56.525
how this part
turns out first.

10:56.568 --> 10:58.570
Okay.

11:00.268 --> 11:02.923
There is one thing we could try.

11:09.364 --> 11:11.714
Hi, there.
The bar is not

11:11.758 --> 11:15.283
technically open yet, but...

11:15.326 --> 11:16.676
can I get you
a drink anyway?

11:16.719 --> 11:18.286
Whatever you're making is fine.

11:18.329 --> 11:20.723
Oh. It is a blue mango martini,

11:20.767 --> 11:23.683
and I'm calling it
the Naughty Girl.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.690
What the hell, Mom?

11:37.305 --> 11:39.873
You were supposed to be waiting
in New York for my call,

11:39.916 --> 11:41.439
not coming to Atlanta

11:41.483 --> 11:44.007
and getting a job at a club
owned by a semi-Carrington.

11:44.051 --> 11:45.748
You defied me, Vanessa.

11:45.792 --> 11:46.880
Because you were
taking too long.

11:46.923 --> 11:48.359
You promised

11:48.403 --> 11:50.666
I'd be able to move down here
weeks ago.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.842
And it's not like
I got a job at Club Colby.

11:52.886 --> 11:56.019
I am so close
to earning Jeff's trust.

11:56.063 --> 11:58.848
If he finds out
you're my stepdaughter,

11:58.892 --> 12:02.286
I promise you
he will not react well.

12:02.330 --> 12:06.334
I won't tell anyone who I am,
but I'm staying.

12:06.377 --> 12:08.945
I thought that's
what we both wanted.

12:08.989 --> 12:12.296
Look, I know how hard
you've been working down here.

12:12.340 --> 12:15.256
I'm just ready
to start my career.

12:15.299 --> 12:16.953
And we'll get you
on Monica's label

12:16.997 --> 12:19.216
and use Jeff's streaming service
to play your music,

12:19.260 --> 12:22.089
and soon, everyone
will know who you are.

12:22.132 --> 12:23.917
I'm sorry.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.135
I know it takes time.

12:25.179 --> 12:28.660
Don't apologize.
I'm happy to see you.

12:29.836 --> 12:31.533
Oh...

12:33.013 --> 12:35.885
Yes, Lauren, I re--
I really appreciate it.

12:35.929 --> 12:38.975
And I-I, actually, I want to get
this done as soon as possible.

12:39.019 --> 12:40.498
No, no.
You're my only choice.

12:40.542 --> 12:41.804
Um...

12:41.848 --> 12:43.414
Hey, Lauren, can I, uh,
give you a call back?

12:43.458 --> 12:45.460
Yeah. Okay.

12:45.503 --> 12:47.941
Excuse me. How can I help you?

12:47.984 --> 12:49.769
Excuse me.

12:49.812 --> 12:51.553
Hello?
FALLON:
Hi.

12:51.596 --> 12:53.337
They're just getting rid
of the stuff I don't want.

12:53.381 --> 12:55.949
Sort of cleansing the office
of your aura.

12:55.992 --> 12:58.952
Uh, is Liam's amnesia contagious
or have you just lost your mind?

12:58.995 --> 13:01.258
Neither of those,
but you just lost your lease.

13:01.302 --> 13:04.000
Because although
you may own Femperial,

13:04.044 --> 13:07.612
my lawyer-- thank you, Evan--
discovered that the signatory

13:07.656 --> 13:09.745
on the building's lease
is not Femperial,

13:09.789 --> 13:12.574
but the company
I bought to get Femperial.

13:12.617 --> 13:15.185
So really, you're the one
who's trespassing.

13:15.229 --> 13:17.579
Well, what about all my stuff?
My files?

13:17.622 --> 13:19.189
Oh, well, Kirby,
I'm not heartless.

13:19.233 --> 13:20.625
I told the boys to be gentle

13:20.669 --> 13:21.844
when they throw it out
on the curb.

13:21.888 --> 13:25.369
You are a petty, petty woman.

13:25.413 --> 13:26.936
Yes. But with a great office.

13:28.982 --> 13:30.853
Okay.

13:30.897 --> 13:32.594
I'm not gonna lie,
that felt pretty good.

13:32.637 --> 13:33.900
Oh, what?

13:33.943 --> 13:36.903
Is it bad form to gloat
in the legal community?

13:36.946 --> 13:38.513
This is Lauren Hall's rÃ©sumÃ©.

13:38.556 --> 13:41.385
Looks like Kirby's about
to close a deal to make her CEO.

13:41.429 --> 13:43.910
And with an actual grown-up with
a proven track record on board,

13:43.953 --> 13:46.390
Kirby won't have any trouble
securing a new lease somewhere.Wow.

13:46.434 --> 13:47.870
Good for her.

13:47.914 --> 13:49.219
Why does it seem like
when you say "good for her,"

13:49.263 --> 13:50.264
you don't really mean it?

13:50.307 --> 13:51.569
What are you
planning to do?

13:51.613 --> 13:53.658
I don't know. It's percolating.

13:53.702 --> 13:57.924
But, hey, you should come with
me to this hotel party tonight.

13:57.967 --> 14:00.404
You can get a front row
seat to the Kirby show

14:00.448 --> 14:01.884
and we can celebrate
our victory.

14:01.928 --> 14:04.191
Okay. It's a date.

14:04.234 --> 14:05.888
Oh, well, it's...

14:05.932 --> 14:08.151
Yeah, I guess it is.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.946
SAM :
Hey, Ashanti.

14:23.166 --> 14:25.952
Hey, there. Big fan.

14:25.995 --> 14:28.955
Thanks. Kind of
in my zone, so...

14:28.998 --> 14:30.957
I know, but I just
wanted to thank you

14:31.000 --> 14:33.350
for being such an inspiration.

14:33.394 --> 14:35.962
Also, my hotel
is opening tonight.

14:36.005 --> 14:37.398
You should totally
come to the party.

14:37.441 --> 14:39.226
It's the only hotel
in Atlanta owned

14:39.269 --> 14:41.358
by a queer person of color.

14:41.402 --> 14:43.273
And if you wanted to sing...?

14:44.927 --> 14:46.886
I appreciate you being
a big fan and all,

14:46.929 --> 14:49.497
but yoga's kind of, like,
my "me time."

14:49.540 --> 14:50.802
So I'm probably not

14:50.846 --> 14:53.893
gonna be able to sing
at your hotel tonight.

14:53.936 --> 14:57.766
I read somewhere
that you love soccer.

14:57.809 --> 15:00.769
I could get you VIP
season tickets to the Atlantix.

15:00.812 --> 15:04.207
That's sweet, but I actually
don't even live here.

15:06.209 --> 15:08.211
Well, Victor Diaz
is gonna be there.

15:08.255 --> 15:10.648
He's really hot and you can
hang out with him if you want.

15:10.692 --> 15:13.173
Okay, relax.

15:13.216 --> 15:15.871
You're unemployed and doing yoga
in Buckhead, not India.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.307
Geez.

15:17.351 --> 15:19.309
Victor Diaz?
He's the midfielder, right?

15:19.353 --> 15:21.311
Uh-huh.He's kind of cute.

15:21.355 --> 15:22.747
So cute.

15:22.791 --> 15:24.401
This could be kind of cool.

15:24.445 --> 15:25.620
Well...
Wha--

15:25.663 --> 15:26.882
After class.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.579
Okay.

15:30.581 --> 15:31.974
Namaste.

15:36.892 --> 15:39.199
If Anders still worked here,
we'd know every time this judge

15:39.242 --> 15:41.201
even thought about
something illegal.

15:41.244 --> 15:43.986
Only thing this P.I. found
on him is that he sucks at golf

15:44.030 --> 15:45.727
and his son's a loser.

15:45.770 --> 15:46.946
Pretty sure that's
not enough

15:46.989 --> 15:48.686
to get him to recuse himself.

15:48.730 --> 15:52.429
Okay, but what
if Judge Fairbanks

15:52.473 --> 15:56.433
has been dealing illegally
with my family for years?

15:57.521 --> 15:58.914
He has?

15:58.958 --> 16:00.481
No.

16:00.524 --> 16:05.573
But once I make a few calls,
the past can be... adjusted.

16:05.616 --> 16:07.357
I don't know about that.

16:07.401 --> 16:09.490
There's just too many things
that could go wrong.

16:09.533 --> 16:13.885
Relax. My father and I are
finally on speaking terms,

16:13.929 --> 16:16.758
and he can be very helpful
with this sort of thing.

16:20.849 --> 16:23.330
You should check
on Adam and Nadia.

16:23.373 --> 16:24.548
When I popped in
earlier,

16:24.592 --> 16:25.854
he seemed reluctant
to let her help.

16:25.897 --> 16:28.030
Yeah. I should be
the one helping him.

16:28.074 --> 16:29.684
You can't
do everything,

16:29.727 --> 16:32.252
and we need to prepare
for the possibility

16:32.295 --> 16:34.558
that he may never
get his vision back.

16:34.602 --> 16:35.559
Meaning what?

16:35.603 --> 16:37.170
We should consider sending him

16:37.213 --> 16:38.998
to a private rehab,
until he learns

16:39.041 --> 16:40.869
how to live with this.

16:40.912 --> 16:44.699
You know what? Let's-let's just
fix one problem at a time,

16:44.742 --> 16:46.092
starting with the judge.

16:55.884 --> 16:58.017
You look like
you could use a break.

16:58.060 --> 17:00.193
I baked you
some oatmeal cookies.

17:00.236 --> 17:02.717
I remembered
they were your favorite.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.240
And I remember Grandma
making them for me

17:04.284 --> 17:07.243
because you said baking
ruined a good manicure.

17:07.287 --> 17:09.245
Okay, fine.
I paid someone to make them,

17:09.289 --> 17:11.160
but it's the thought
that counts.

17:11.204 --> 17:13.293
What do you really want?

17:13.336 --> 17:16.078
I was hoping we could
spend the day together.

17:17.166 --> 17:19.690
Well, that sounds nice,
actually.

17:19.734 --> 17:22.824
Doesn't it? And then, tonight,
you can be my plus-one

17:22.867 --> 17:26.045
for the grand opening
of La Mirage.

17:26.088 --> 17:29.483
No. No way am I going
to a Carrington party.

17:29.526 --> 17:31.746
The only Carrington
going tonight is Fallon,

17:31.789 --> 17:33.922
and she was the first one
that offered to help

17:33.965 --> 17:35.967
when you were missing.

17:36.011 --> 17:40.189
I thought it would be a nice way
for us to relax and hang out,

17:40.233 --> 17:43.584
but it looks like it was
a foolish idea.

17:43.627 --> 17:45.325
Forget I mentioned it.

17:45.368 --> 17:46.848
Wait.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.852
If it'll make you happy,
then fine.

17:50.895 --> 17:52.071
I'll go to the party.

17:53.115 --> 17:55.770
Very happy.

17:55.813 --> 17:56.988
Jessica?

17:57.032 --> 17:58.947
Hi. Fallon Carrington.

17:58.990 --> 18:01.776
Listen, I wanted to invite you
to the grand opening

18:01.819 --> 18:04.822
of La Mirage tonight
as my guest.

18:04.866 --> 18:07.564
Of course I'll send the jet.

18:07.608 --> 18:10.001
Are you kidding me?
You were the very first person

18:10.045 --> 18:11.307
I thought of, Barbara.

18:11.351 --> 18:13.527
Can I add you
to the VIP guest list?

18:13.570 --> 18:15.616
Fantastic.

18:15.659 --> 18:16.834
That's right.

18:16.878 --> 18:18.053
Kirby will be there, too.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.925
Yes, it'll be quite a show.

18:20.969 --> 18:23.363
I'll see you tonight, Kit.

18:33.590 --> 18:35.244
NADIA:
There you are.

18:35.288 --> 18:36.680
For the love of dogs,

18:36.724 --> 18:38.204
why are you still here?

18:38.247 --> 18:40.423
Because we are supposed to be
working on your cane skills,

18:40.467 --> 18:41.990
not your piano skills.

18:42.033 --> 18:43.078
Trust me,
when you can get around

18:43.122 --> 18:44.166
without hugging the walls,

18:44.210 --> 18:46.081
you'll feel amazing.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.343
Now, look,

18:47.387 --> 18:49.954
I know this will be
overwhelming and...

18:49.998 --> 18:52.566
and tough--
that's very mature.

18:53.697 --> 18:56.047
Ow! What's wrong with you?

18:56.091 --> 18:57.223
I don't think I'm the one
with the problem here.

18:57.266 --> 18:59.181
Well, I do.
So what is it? Tell me.

18:59.225 --> 19:01.052
Abusive husband?

19:01.096 --> 19:04.404
Oh, no, no, no, wait.
Drunk parents, right?

19:04.447 --> 19:06.406
See, I'm just trying
to figure out what makes someone

19:06.449 --> 19:09.104
so pathologically
and annoyingly helpful.

19:09.148 --> 19:12.107
Your diagnosis is both
completely wrong and irrelevant.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.500
It's a good effort, though.

19:13.543 --> 19:15.110
I know I'm the blind one,
but why can't you see

19:15.154 --> 19:16.503
that I don't want your help?

19:16.546 --> 19:18.287
I'd be more worried about
what some other people

19:18.331 --> 19:20.115
in this house
are thinking of you.

19:21.116 --> 19:23.727
But I'll be upstairs
if you need me.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.993
You're new.
I'm Nadia.

19:29.037 --> 19:31.300
Right. Well, I would love some
champagne while I get ready.

19:31.344 --> 19:33.128
You can just bring that
to my room.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.000
I'm not a maid.
I'm Adam's therapist.

19:36.044 --> 19:39.003
And you are?Now feeling very sorry for you.

19:39.047 --> 19:41.005
Do you have specialized training
with sociopaths?

19:41.049 --> 19:43.138
Is that why
they hired you?Sociopaths?

19:43.182 --> 19:43.965
What do you mean?

19:44.008 --> 19:45.271
FALLON:
I'm sorry.

19:45.314 --> 19:46.489
I have to take this.

19:48.317 --> 19:49.884
Hello? Liam?

19:49.927 --> 19:51.277
LIAM :
Fallon.

19:51.320 --> 19:53.148
That's me.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.324
Uh, look, I was just calling
to check in about my stuff,

19:55.368 --> 19:57.021
see if you found
my passport yet.

19:57.065 --> 19:59.981
Oh, well, um...

20:00.024 --> 20:01.243
I've just been really swamped,

20:01.287 --> 20:04.246
and I haven't gotten
a chance to look yet.

20:04.290 --> 20:06.466
Okay, well, I'd appreciate
if you could do it,

20:06.509 --> 20:08.163
I don't know, you know, soon?

20:08.207 --> 20:10.252
So, just, um,
let me know, I guess.

20:10.296 --> 20:12.254
Will do.

20:35.930 --> 20:38.237
SAM:
Ashanti, Victor.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.368
A photo of my VIP guests?

20:39.412 --> 20:41.109
Oh.

20:41.152 --> 20:42.893
Cute.You need to send me that one.

20:42.937 --> 20:44.808
Okay.
Me, too.

20:44.852 --> 20:45.983
Of course.Oh, my gosh.

20:46.027 --> 20:47.985
This hotel is amazing.

20:48.029 --> 20:50.205
I'm loving this whole
Moroccan vibe.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.685
Are you loving it enough
to give a surprise

20:51.728 --> 20:53.034
opening night performance?

20:53.077 --> 20:55.166
We may be able
to work something out.

20:55.210 --> 20:57.212
If I could stay
here for free...Done.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.387
...for life.

20:58.431 --> 21:00.694
Free for this life
and the afterlife.
Yes.

21:00.737 --> 21:03.305
Ashanti. Wow. Um,

21:03.349 --> 21:04.350
I didn't know
you'd be here.

21:04.393 --> 21:05.742
Uh, can I get you a drink?

21:05.786 --> 21:07.222
Um, I really
don't drink.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.093
But I'll take
a strawberry mojito

21:09.137 --> 21:12.009
with a tiny bit
of alcohol.VICTOR: Dos.

21:12.053 --> 21:14.185
I'm in training.All right, got it.

21:16.187 --> 21:17.363
We're kind of cute.

21:17.406 --> 21:18.973
You should post that
on Insta.

21:19.016 --> 21:21.149
#LaMirage,
#BoutiqueChic.

21:21.192 --> 21:23.194
Actually, uh, do me a favor
and just, uh,

21:23.238 --> 21:24.457
keep me off social tonight?

21:24.500 --> 21:25.675
Uh...

21:25.719 --> 21:26.981
But I can't wait
to hear you sing.

21:27.024 --> 21:29.113
Are all the soccer players
this sweet?

21:29.157 --> 21:30.463
VANESSA:
All right,

21:30.506 --> 21:32.813
here we are.
No, um,

21:32.856 --> 21:34.205
this one's for Ashanti.

21:34.249 --> 21:36.338
Thank you.

21:36.382 --> 21:37.339
Salud. Salud.

21:37.383 --> 21:39.123
Salud.

21:53.399 --> 21:55.705
Thanks.
I think.

21:55.749 --> 21:58.142
EVAN :
I can't tell which
looks more incredible,

21:58.186 --> 21:59.535
this place or you.

21:59.579 --> 22:02.364
Oh, look at you. Making
a cheesy line sound genuine.

22:02.408 --> 22:05.193
You must be great
in front of a jury.

22:05.236 --> 22:08.022
Hey, uh, will you excuse me
for just one sec?

22:08.065 --> 22:09.545
EVAN:
Uh, I didn't

22:09.589 --> 22:11.634
realize you were meeting
someone else here.

22:11.678 --> 22:13.897
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no.
That's just my cousin.

22:13.941 --> 22:17.205
I mean, I did sleep with him
and then almost marry him,

22:17.248 --> 22:19.033
but the bottom line is,
he's my cousin,

22:19.076 --> 22:20.382
so it won't happen again.

22:20.426 --> 22:22.253
Got it. But
not really.

22:22.297 --> 22:23.429
That's fine.
Listen, go get some food

22:23.472 --> 22:24.647
and explore, I'll find you
in a little bit.

22:24.691 --> 22:26.432
Okay.Okay.

22:28.825 --> 22:30.871
Ow. What was that for?

22:30.914 --> 22:32.742
For disappearing
off the face of the planet

22:32.786 --> 22:34.570
and letting us all think
that you were dead.

22:34.614 --> 22:36.703
Whoa-whoa-whoa,
that, that was not my fault.

22:36.746 --> 22:38.966
My boys surprised me
with a heli-skiing trip,

22:39.009 --> 22:40.750
and-and I cut my hand
as they were wrestling me

22:40.794 --> 22:42.186
into the party bus.

22:42.230 --> 22:44.188
Okay, and it didn't occur to you
to call your family

22:44.232 --> 22:46.234
and let them know that you were
okay? I mean, Monica

22:46.277 --> 22:47.583
was practically
out of her mind.

22:47.627 --> 22:50.020
I was on a remote mountain
in some Swiss canton

22:50.064 --> 22:51.065
I'd never heard of.

22:51.108 --> 22:52.240
I didn't have
any service.

22:52.283 --> 22:53.284
I had no idea
people thought

22:53.328 --> 22:55.591
something shady
happened. Look,

22:55.635 --> 22:57.593
I'm sorry for scaring you.

22:57.637 --> 22:59.595
Means a lot that you cared.

22:59.639 --> 23:03.120
Fine. I will forgive you.
This time.

23:04.383 --> 23:05.819
Oh, look.

23:05.862 --> 23:07.298
Your mom is torturing
the help.

23:07.342 --> 23:10.258
JEFF:
Yeah. Probably not
for the first time. Uh,

23:10.301 --> 23:13.348
guess I should go
and save that poor girl.Yep.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.829
Mom, what are
you doing?

23:26.448 --> 23:27.797
Okay, okay.

23:27.841 --> 23:29.799
Uno mÃ¡s.Just
the three of us.

23:29.843 --> 23:32.193
Uh-huh. Please?
A vez.

23:33.586 --> 23:35.414
Okay. Ready?

23:35.457 --> 23:38.939
Um... actually, the light
here is way harsh, so

23:38.982 --> 23:41.332
why don't we come over
to this side? Yes.

23:41.376 --> 23:44.031
Slow down.
I'm not feeling so well.

23:45.075 --> 23:46.990
You okay?Yeah.

23:47.034 --> 23:48.731
All right.

23:50.603 --> 23:52.126
Well, I know you don't
own this building,

23:52.169 --> 23:53.780
so you can't kick me out
of here, too.

23:53.823 --> 23:56.217
I've come
to bury the hatchet.Oh, in my skull?

23:56.260 --> 23:59.307
Good one. But no.Okay, what's
this about?

23:59.350 --> 24:03.354
Evan helped me see that
I might have gone a little crazy

24:03.398 --> 24:05.182
trying to get
Femperial back,

24:05.226 --> 24:07.924
so I am sorry.

24:07.968 --> 24:09.839
Really?

24:09.883 --> 24:11.754
Yes, really.
Now accept my apology

24:11.798 --> 24:13.843
before I change my mind.
I'm very fickle that way.

24:13.887 --> 24:15.236
Wow. Okay, fine.
Apology accepted.

24:15.279 --> 24:16.542
Can I have my
office back?

24:16.585 --> 24:18.935
What? No, this is an apology,
not a charity event.

24:18.979 --> 24:20.459
I still need
an office, but...

24:20.502 --> 24:23.287
come on, can't we just
call it a truce

24:23.331 --> 24:25.289
and end this war?

24:25.333 --> 24:26.682
Fine.

24:26.726 --> 24:29.337
Good. Hey.
Thank you. Okay.

24:29.380 --> 24:32.340
To women
supporting women.

24:36.518 --> 24:38.346
Ooh.

24:47.834 --> 24:50.532
I can hear you.

24:50.576 --> 24:53.317
Then you're obviously
filled with gratitude

24:53.361 --> 24:56.277
that I'm here to keep you
from breaking your neck.

24:56.320 --> 24:57.757
Just let me help you get
wherever you're going.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.367
I won't even talk,
you can wallow in peace.

25:01.238 --> 25:03.371
Look, I j-- I just want
to talk to my father,

25:03.414 --> 25:04.807
and I don't need you
to hold my hand

25:04.851 --> 25:06.853
while I'm doing it.Fine, just
try the cane.

25:06.896 --> 25:09.725
Will you just find someone
else to harass, please?

25:12.162 --> 25:14.425
I know you've got
major daddy issues,

25:14.469 --> 25:15.905
but acting like
an entitled brat

25:15.949 --> 25:18.081
is a bad look, and it sure
isn't gonna win Daddy's love.

25:18.125 --> 25:19.430
But it will definitely
help Cristal

25:19.474 --> 25:21.302
make her case
for sending you away.

25:21.345 --> 25:23.565
So how about you just
take the damn cane?I...

25:23.609 --> 25:25.567
Aah!
Oh, I'm sorry.

25:25.611 --> 25:27.134
I'm s-- Nadia?

25:27.177 --> 25:29.310
Na-- N-Nadia. Nadia?

25:29.353 --> 25:31.268
Nadia, I-I didn't mean to...

25:31.312 --> 25:33.314
Ah...FALLON: Another round,

25:33.357 --> 25:36.143
please.Uh-uh. No.
I surrender.

25:36.186 --> 25:37.448
Oh, come on, Kirby.

25:37.492 --> 25:39.407
Your people descended
from hardened criminals.

25:39.450 --> 25:40.277
You'll be fine.

25:40.321 --> 25:42.453
Thank you.

25:42.497 --> 25:43.411
Ready?

25:43.454 --> 25:45.500
Come on.
Bottoms up.

25:50.636 --> 25:52.115
Oh.Good girl.

25:52.159 --> 25:53.464
Come with me.Huh?

25:53.508 --> 25:55.336
Come on.

25:57.947 --> 26:01.037
Lorna?Oh, I think
it's Lauren.

26:01.081 --> 26:04.432
Lauren Hall, right?
Your soon-to-be CEO?Hello, Kirby.

26:04.475 --> 26:05.520
Uh, Fallon Carrington.

26:05.564 --> 26:06.913
I don't think
we've had the pleasure.

26:06.956 --> 26:08.349
The pleasure's mine.

26:08.392 --> 26:09.480
: I didn't know
she was gonna be here.

26:09.524 --> 26:11.091
: Oh.
: Well,

26:11.134 --> 26:14.355
I invited Lauren so she could
witness your business savvy

26:14.398 --> 26:17.097
in person.Yep.

26:17.140 --> 26:18.707
Business savvy.

26:18.751 --> 26:21.057
Yep, that's me. Mm.

26:21.101 --> 26:23.494
Savvy at business...Oh, look at that,

26:23.538 --> 26:25.801
isn't that Barbara
Padden over there

26:25.845 --> 26:27.411
with Jessica Woods
and Kit Peterson?

26:27.455 --> 26:29.457
LAUREN: Yes.FALLON:
You know them, right?

26:29.500 --> 26:31.633
I mean, they are your
competitors in publishing.

26:31.677 --> 26:33.330
I do know them.
What I don't know is

26:33.374 --> 26:35.594
why they're here.Oh, well, I guess
Kirby invited them.

26:35.637 --> 26:38.727
No. No, I...

26:38.771 --> 26:40.250
I don't even know who those
women are, they're just...

26:40.294 --> 26:41.425
It's...

26:41.469 --> 26:43.340
Uh, hold on,
I need, uh, I need water.

26:43.384 --> 26:45.473
I think, if I had to
guess, she's probably

26:45.516 --> 26:47.344
just keeping all
of her options open

26:47.388 --> 26:49.303
for the new CEO position.
I mean, to be fair,

26:49.346 --> 26:51.653
she didn't know
you were here.Oh, that's clear.

26:51.697 --> 26:53.350
You said I was
your only choice.

26:53.394 --> 26:54.874
You are.
You are.

26:54.917 --> 26:57.267
Um, there's just been
a bit of a mix-up.

26:57.311 --> 26:59.966
Look, Kirby, why don't you go
try to find the ladies' room

27:00.009 --> 27:01.054
and freshen up
a little bit?

27:01.097 --> 27:03.404
Here's your purse.

27:04.448 --> 27:06.450
What's this?
A minibar.

27:08.104 --> 27:09.279
LAUREN:
Okay,

27:09.323 --> 27:11.194
this night has been
very illuminating.

27:11.238 --> 27:14.502
Thank you for
inviting me.

27:14.545 --> 27:15.590
We're done.

27:15.634 --> 27:16.896
Wait, what?

27:19.725 --> 27:21.161
I think she likes you.

27:28.298 --> 27:29.430
Hello, everyone.

27:29.473 --> 27:32.781
I'm Sam, owner of La Mirage.

27:32.825 --> 27:34.957
And to thank you guys
for coming out tonight,

27:35.001 --> 27:37.307
we have a surprise guest
for you.

27:37.351 --> 27:39.266
So without further ado,

27:39.309 --> 27:43.009
Grammy award winner Ashanti!

27:51.017 --> 27:54.411
Uh, give me one second. DJ?

27:56.936 --> 27:58.894
Ms. Ashanti is
not feeling well.

27:58.938 --> 28:01.810
She's in one of our guest rooms,
looking rather ill

28:01.854 --> 28:04.595
and refusing to move more
than five feet from a commode.

28:04.639 --> 28:05.727
What are we gonna do?

28:05.771 --> 28:07.686
We're supposed to
have entertainment.

28:07.729 --> 28:10.297
What about that string lady
from the philharmonic?

28:10.340 --> 28:11.385
The cellist?Yeah.

28:11.428 --> 28:12.821
She'll be
in bed already.

28:12.865 --> 28:15.519
Well, go wake her up.Oh, it's too late
for that.

28:15.563 --> 28:16.999
I'll tell you
what, though.

28:17.043 --> 28:18.566
I'm rather adept
at juggling fruit.

28:18.609 --> 28:21.351
If you've got three oranges,
I could put on quite a show.

28:21.395 --> 28:23.614
I'm just gonna pretend
I never heard that.

28:23.658 --> 28:25.225
VANESSA:
Hello, everyone.

28:25.268 --> 28:26.922
I'm Vanessa.

28:26.966 --> 28:29.098
And since Ashanti
couldn't make it,

28:29.142 --> 28:32.145
I thought I'd provide
some entertainment for you.

28:32.188 --> 28:35.017
Who gave the microphone
to my bartender?

28:35.061 --> 28:37.411
Mixologist.

28:37.454 --> 28:39.630
âª Has anybody told you
you're like a queen âª

28:39.674 --> 28:42.590
âª You're like a star,
so beautiful tonight âª

28:45.332 --> 28:47.421
âª Has anybody made you
feel like nothing âª

28:47.464 --> 28:51.381
âª Could ever stop you or
hold you back if you tried? âª

28:53.644 --> 28:57.779
âª You deserve the world,
you deserve the world âª

28:57.823 --> 28:59.650
âª Just give it everything

28:59.694 --> 29:01.914
âª You can have it
if you believe âª

29:01.957 --> 29:04.351
âª It's finally your turn

29:04.394 --> 29:06.005
âª Now it's your turn

29:06.048 --> 29:09.791
âª Just give it everything
'cause, baby, you got this âª

29:09.835 --> 29:14.013
âª Anything, you can do
anything you want... âª

29:14.056 --> 29:15.579
Isn't that the bartender
you were harassing?

29:15.623 --> 29:17.843
I wasn't
harassing her.

29:17.886 --> 29:20.541
She's one of the artists
I was managing in New York.

29:20.584 --> 29:22.891
She's pretty amazing.

29:22.935 --> 29:25.807
What's amazing is how Ashanti
got sick at the last minute,

29:25.851 --> 29:28.897
and the bartender youhappen
to manage was right there,

29:28.941 --> 29:30.507
just waiting
to perform.

29:30.551 --> 29:32.858
Isn't it, though?
Serendipity.

29:35.817 --> 29:37.776
You are one crazy woman,
you know that?

29:37.819 --> 29:39.647
Does that mean you're
ready to work together?

29:39.690 --> 29:40.822
You've got the
streaming platform,

29:40.866 --> 29:41.954
I've got the artists.

29:41.997 --> 29:44.478
Why are you pushing this
so hard, huh?

29:44.521 --> 29:47.481
Why can't you just be
my mom? For once?

29:47.524 --> 29:50.701
That's exactly what
I'm trying to do.

29:50.745 --> 29:53.530
I know I can't take any
of the credit for how well

29:53.574 --> 29:56.055
you and Monica
turned out, but

29:56.098 --> 29:58.535
I'd like to think the
one thing I gave you

29:58.579 --> 30:00.973
was your love of music.

30:02.583 --> 30:06.108
We used to spend hours
making up silly songs

30:06.152 --> 30:08.154
and dancing around.

30:08.197 --> 30:09.808
I remember.

30:09.851 --> 30:13.855
I thought it would be
a way for us to reconnect.

30:13.899 --> 30:16.292
Get back to
happy times.

30:16.336 --> 30:18.991
All I want to be
is your mom.

30:23.125 --> 30:26.302
Well, I could really use
a mom right now.

30:26.346 --> 30:28.217
Because...

30:30.002 --> 30:31.133
I'm sick.

30:31.177 --> 30:32.831
What?

30:32.874 --> 30:36.443
Remember how I told you
Adam came after me?

30:36.486 --> 30:38.619
Well, he poisoned me.

30:38.662 --> 30:41.883
And it caused some damage
to my brain.

30:41.927 --> 30:44.538
I don't understand.
What-What's wrong?

30:44.581 --> 30:47.323
It's called neurotoxicity.

30:47.367 --> 30:51.893
And eventually
I'll lose my ability to speak,

30:51.937 --> 30:54.069
my motor skills.

30:54.113 --> 30:55.941
Could be years.

30:56.985 --> 30:59.335
Could be months.

31:00.380 --> 31:02.164
Jeff, I'm sorry.

31:02.208 --> 31:04.253
âª Don't give up

31:04.297 --> 31:07.866
âª Don't give up,
just don't give up. âª

31:11.782 --> 31:14.568
Thank you.

31:17.745 --> 31:20.139
Leaving so soon, Judge?

31:20.182 --> 31:22.663
Uh... do we know each other?

31:22.706 --> 31:24.447
Not officially.

31:24.491 --> 31:26.406
I'm sorry to hear
about all the trouble

31:26.449 --> 31:27.494
you've been going through.

31:27.537 --> 31:30.323
Trouble?
What, uh...?

31:30.366 --> 31:31.585
I'm sorry,
I didn't catch your name?

31:31.628 --> 31:34.283
Cristal. Carrington.

31:35.589 --> 31:37.547
This is completely
inappropriate, Ms. Carrington.

31:37.591 --> 31:40.028
Of course. You're right.
I just...

31:40.072 --> 31:42.509
I wanted to apologize
for what's happening

31:42.552 --> 31:45.033
with my family and your son.

31:45.077 --> 31:48.645
What does your family
got to do with my son?

31:48.689 --> 31:52.736
That's your son, isn't it,
with my brother?

31:54.608 --> 31:57.002
I just hope these photos
don't get out.

31:57.045 --> 31:58.873
How would it look
if the press found out

31:58.917 --> 32:00.527
that a prominent
federal judge

32:00.570 --> 32:05.314
asked the Flores family for
a favor for his wayward son?

32:05.358 --> 32:07.229
I don't know where
you got these pictures,

32:07.273 --> 32:09.928
but I have never spoken
to any member of your family.

32:09.971 --> 32:13.975
So strange, because
my father swears you promised

32:14.019 --> 32:16.760
favorable judgments
for all his U.S. businesses.

32:16.804 --> 32:18.545
We both know that's a lie.

32:21.722 --> 32:24.159
But the media will have
a field day with it either way.

32:26.770 --> 32:30.600
What you're doing is despicable.

32:30.644 --> 32:32.994
I'm comfortable with that.

32:38.043 --> 32:39.522
This party's
a disaster.

32:39.566 --> 32:41.524
My surprise guest is off
being sick somewhere,

32:41.568 --> 32:43.091
your daughter's stealing liquor,

32:43.135 --> 32:44.788
and my bartender's
the entertainment,

32:44.832 --> 32:46.573
though she was quite good.

32:46.616 --> 32:48.575
And I might be tendering
my resignation.

32:48.618 --> 32:51.882
Look, I don't have time for
your jokes I never get, Anders.

32:51.926 --> 32:54.015
Well, unfortunately, on this
occasion, I'm not joking.

32:54.059 --> 32:57.888
What?I came here to be your partner,
not your lackey.

32:57.932 --> 33:00.543
If I wanted to get ordered
around, I'd go back to the manor

33:00.587 --> 33:02.850
because at least
I get my meals for free.

33:02.893 --> 33:04.634
Hold up, you are the one
that told me

33:04.678 --> 33:06.636
to focus on the hotel
and not the plaque,

33:06.680 --> 33:07.681
and that's
what I did.

33:07.724 --> 33:08.769
Th-This whole night

33:08.812 --> 33:10.205
was me trying to erase
that plaque

33:10.249 --> 33:11.467
with a giant spectacle.

33:11.511 --> 33:14.644
Well, I'm afraid the plaque
can't be erased,

33:14.688 --> 33:16.733
which is why I wanted you
to focus on the hotel.

33:16.777 --> 33:19.258
Focus on what owning the hotel
brings you,

33:19.301 --> 33:22.261
like the opportunity to promote
more Latinos into management,

33:22.304 --> 33:24.654
or to support a cause
that's close to your heart.

33:24.698 --> 33:29.050
Yeah, that does sound more
like something you would say.

33:29.094 --> 33:30.660
You're the boss now.

33:30.704 --> 33:33.011
Use that responsibility
to do some good.

33:37.754 --> 33:40.453
Hey. We need to talk.

33:40.496 --> 33:42.672
Look, I'm-I'm sorry about Nadia.
It was an accident.

33:42.716 --> 33:44.761
If she's claiming
I hit her on purpose, I...No.

33:44.805 --> 33:47.329
She's not claiming
anything.

33:47.373 --> 33:48.635
I haven't even spoken
to the girl.

33:48.678 --> 33:50.071
She didn't quit?

33:50.115 --> 33:52.334
No, no.

33:58.384 --> 34:01.735
Father, I'm sorry.

34:01.778 --> 34:05.739
Just... please give Nadia
a real chance for me.

34:05.782 --> 34:07.132
All right?

34:07.175 --> 34:10.744
Otherwise things
may have to change.

34:10.787 --> 34:12.050
What do you mean?

34:12.093 --> 34:13.747
If you can't figure out
how to work with Nadia,

34:13.790 --> 34:15.270
we've been discussing
sending you to a school

34:15.314 --> 34:18.099
that specializes
in this type of thing.

34:18.143 --> 34:20.797
Who-Who's "we"?

34:20.841 --> 34:22.277
You mean Cristal?

34:22.321 --> 34:24.323
Cristal is my wife,
and she's not going anywhere.

34:24.366 --> 34:27.152
You need to get used to the idea
that she's gonna be around

34:27.195 --> 34:29.241
and having a say in what happens
to our family.

34:29.284 --> 34:31.504
But this,

34:31.547 --> 34:34.420
this decision depends entirely
on how you handle things

34:34.463 --> 34:36.900
from here on out.
I...

34:42.732 --> 34:45.431
SPORTSCASTER:
Now it's 1st and 10
at the 30-yard line.

35:05.190 --> 35:06.800
FALLON:
Ladies,

35:06.843 --> 35:08.976
I just want to thank you
again for coming.

35:09.019 --> 35:12.066
You truly can't imagine the joy
your presence has brought me.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.415
Talk to you soon.

35:13.459 --> 35:15.504
I'll sell Femperial
back to you.

35:15.548 --> 35:17.854
I just want to be done
with your whole family.

35:17.898 --> 35:19.160
You win, Fallon.

35:19.204 --> 35:20.814
Surely you realize that,

35:20.857 --> 35:23.382
since you no longer have
a competent CEO,

35:23.425 --> 35:25.514
my offer has dropped
significantly.

35:25.558 --> 35:27.647
Why are you so obsessed
with teaching me a lesson?

35:27.690 --> 35:30.998
Let's call it my generous spirit
as a female mentor.

35:31.041 --> 35:34.088
I don't get it, you never even
cared about Femperial.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.655
You always called it
a "boutique company."

35:35.698 --> 35:38.788
You don't even like books
unless they're about you.

35:38.832 --> 35:42.575
Oh, my God. That's what this
is all about, isn't it?

35:44.011 --> 35:46.361
I can't believe
I didn't see this sooner.

35:46.405 --> 35:47.971
This is about Liam.

35:48.015 --> 35:51.236
This has nothing to do
with Liam. You are drunk.

35:51.279 --> 35:53.586
Hmm, I'm not too drunk
to smell your desperation.

35:53.629 --> 35:55.805
What, you think that being
Liam's boss is gonna make him

35:55.849 --> 35:57.198
fall in love
with you again?

35:57.242 --> 35:59.635
Aw. That's just sad.

35:59.679 --> 36:01.202
You know what?

36:01.246 --> 36:03.073
I think I will
keep Femperial,

36:03.117 --> 36:05.293
if only to protect Liam
from his stalker.

36:06.686 --> 36:08.557
Offer rejected.

36:08.601 --> 36:11.691
âª With you by my side...

36:11.734 --> 36:13.475
She's right, isn't she?

36:13.519 --> 36:15.564
God, I'm such an idiot.

36:15.608 --> 36:17.566
No, no, no, Evan, it's...No, no, no, I get it.

36:17.610 --> 36:19.307
I misread the signs.
It's all cool,

36:19.351 --> 36:22.528
but, uh, find a new pawn
to help get your fiancÃ© back.

36:22.571 --> 36:24.573
You've already done
enough damage to my life.

36:25.618 --> 36:27.489
âª With you by my side.

36:32.233 --> 36:35.671
Oh, no, thank you. I'll have my
reservations manager reach out.

36:35.715 --> 36:37.630
Let me guess, Miley Cyrus?

36:37.673 --> 36:40.285
The Trevor Project.
We're partnering up.

36:40.328 --> 36:43.157
Starting tomorrow, the hotel
will have a permanent room block

36:43.201 --> 36:45.594
available
for at-risk LGBTQ youth.

36:45.638 --> 36:47.205
Well done.

36:47.248 --> 36:50.077
Thanks. I told them
they could call me any time,

36:50.120 --> 36:54.473
or reach out to my partner
Joseph Anders,

36:54.516 --> 36:56.170
who helped me
make it all happen.

36:56.214 --> 36:59.521
As your partner,
I'm very proud of you.

36:59.565 --> 37:02.437
Now let's get back out there.
I hear this party's lit.

37:02.481 --> 37:03.960
Oh.

37:04.004 --> 37:06.441
JENNINGS:
The judge agreed

37:06.485 --> 37:10.053
to recuse himself.
He's announcing it tomorrow.

37:11.620 --> 37:13.579
Do you know how sexy you are

37:13.622 --> 37:14.971
when you're devious?

37:15.015 --> 37:17.713
Yes, but tell me again.

37:17.757 --> 37:20.847
Hmm... incredibly sexy.

37:23.763 --> 37:25.895
I'm glad you think so.

37:26.940 --> 37:28.158
I will look
into finding

37:28.202 --> 37:29.682
a really good place
for Adam to go.

37:29.725 --> 37:32.685
Oh, no need to. He's staying
right here with his family.

37:32.728 --> 37:33.773
Blake,

37:33.816 --> 37:35.688
we talked about this.
Mm-hmm.

37:35.731 --> 37:37.733
He's a liability.
Not anymore.

37:37.777 --> 37:40.301
I took your advice and had
a long talk with him tonight.

37:40.345 --> 37:41.694
He's agreed to give Nadia
a chance.

37:41.737 --> 37:43.957
Oh, that's great, but...

37:44.000 --> 37:45.698
And to give you a chance.

37:47.743 --> 37:49.310
You know what would be great?

37:49.354 --> 37:51.747
If my wife
and my son

37:51.791 --> 37:54.794
could coexist peacefully
so I could focus on the trial.

37:56.361 --> 37:58.363
Well, then that's
exactly what we'll do.

38:10.853 --> 38:12.028
SAM:
Culhane,

38:12.072 --> 38:13.726
you made it.Why the hell

38:13.769 --> 38:15.380
was Victor down here,
and where is he now?

38:15.423 --> 38:16.685
Last time I saw him,
he was going

38:16.729 --> 38:18.252
out back with some friends
of his.

38:18.296 --> 38:19.819
VICTOR:
No.

38:19.862 --> 38:22.474
No, n-n-n-n-no. Por favor,
por favor, por favor.

38:22.517 --> 38:24.127
No, no, no, no.

38:26.521 --> 38:28.567
No, please,
I won't say anything to anyone!

38:28.610 --> 38:30.656
Hey!

38:39.926 --> 38:42.058
You okay?

38:42.102 --> 38:43.277
Yeah.

38:43.321 --> 38:46.715
Call 911.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

38:51.546 --> 38:53.635
Fallon?

38:53.679 --> 38:57.552
What are you doing here?
It's pretty late.

38:57.596 --> 39:01.774
I just, um, I wanted
to give you your stuff.

39:01.817 --> 39:03.645
Your passport is on top.

39:03.689 --> 39:06.561
Thanks.

39:06.605 --> 39:08.737
I really appreciate it.

39:08.781 --> 39:11.349
I love you,

39:11.392 --> 39:15.396
and I probably
always will,

39:15.440 --> 39:18.181
but I'm really moving on
this time.

39:18.225 --> 39:20.662
Look, I think it's probably
for the best

39:20.706 --> 39:24.797
that we just... both go
our separate ways.

39:27.103 --> 39:29.889
Okay. Goodbye, Liam.

39:30.890 --> 39:32.892
Bye, Fallon.

39:43.468 --> 39:45.992
Fallon, is that you?

39:46.035 --> 39:47.820
I can smell your perfume.

39:47.863 --> 39:49.387
No, it's me.

39:49.430 --> 39:50.649
And it's
a little weird

39:50.692 --> 39:52.259
that you know
your sister's smell,

39:52.302 --> 39:55.218
but whatever.Nadia, I'm-I'm sorry
about earlier.

39:55.262 --> 39:56.655
It really was an accident,

39:56.698 --> 39:59.397
but I, I promise I'm...

39:59.440 --> 40:01.442
I'm gonna be on my best behavior
from now on.

40:01.486 --> 40:04.489
Please don't give up
on me just yet.

40:06.926 --> 40:10.103
I'm here,
so let me help you.

40:10.146 --> 40:12.714
What do you really need, Adam?

40:12.758 --> 40:14.542
Doesn't matter.

40:14.586 --> 40:16.762
She's not going anywhere
anytime soon.

40:16.805 --> 40:18.894
I'm assuming you mean
your stepmother?

40:18.938 --> 40:20.679
Yeah, that's the one.

40:20.722 --> 40:23.812
Well, then maybe I canhelp you.

40:28.730 --> 40:31.124
Evan?

40:31.167 --> 40:32.604
Hey.

40:32.647 --> 40:34.214
Thank you for coming.

40:35.737 --> 40:39.785
Look, I just wanted to apologize

40:39.828 --> 40:41.395
for my behavior.

40:41.439 --> 40:44.485
I mean, in my defense,
I really, really didn't know

40:44.529 --> 40:46.139
that I was doing
what I was doing

40:46.182 --> 40:48.663
to be close to Liam or whatever.

40:48.707 --> 40:52.145
I mean, it was all subconscious
or unconscious, so...

40:52.188 --> 40:55.104
The point is,
I'm really, really sorry.

40:57.106 --> 40:59.587
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, too.

40:59.631 --> 41:01.197
You don't owe me anything.

41:01.241 --> 41:03.373
You know, you know
I don't blame you for Trixie,

41:03.417 --> 41:06.812
and having an amnesiac ex-fiancÃ©
can't be easy, it's just...

41:10.380 --> 41:13.427
One thing I didn't lie about

41:13.471 --> 41:17.257
is my interest
in seeing where this goes.

41:17.300 --> 41:20.739
So if you'll give me
a second chance?
