WEBVTT

00:01.170 --> 00:02.262
- THEY WEREN'T
OFFICIALLY BOOKED,

00:02.310 --> 00:03.993
SO IT'S NOT GONNA GO
ON THEIR RECORDS.

00:04.030 --> 00:06.066
- MOM, IT WASN'T MY WEED.

00:06.100 --> 00:07.727
- I WANT YOU TO KNOW
YOU MADE ME MAD

00:07.760 --> 00:09.034
AND YOU EMBARRASSED ME.

00:09.070 --> 00:11.584
AND IT'S GONNA BE A LONG TIME
BEFORE YOU EARN MY TRUST BACK.

00:11.630 --> 00:14.076

RACQUEL IS INTENSE.

00:14.110 --> 00:15.281
SHE'S A GREAT MOM.

00:15.320 --> 00:17.868
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE
BETWEEN BEING A MOM

00:17.910 --> 00:18.729
AND HAVING TO WORK.

00:18.770 --> 00:20.044
YOU MAY NOT BE THERE
ALL THE TIME,

00:20.080 --> 00:21.081
BUT THE TIME
THAT YOU DO HAVE

00:21.120 --> 00:21.973
YOU CAN MAKE THAT COUNT.

00:22.020 --> 00:23.738
- IT WAS MINE,
THE POT.

00:23.780 --> 00:24.872
IT WAS MINE.

00:24.920 --> 00:27.184
SORRY FOR NOT BEING THE GIRL
THAT YOU THOUGHT I WAS.

00:28.020 --> 00:29.749
- WHAT MAKES ALL THIS
WORTH IT?

00:29.780 --> 00:31.748
- WHAT MAKES IT WORTH IT IS
THE CONNECTION.

00:31.790 --> 00:33.542
IT'S A BOND YOU FEEL.

00:33.580 --> 00:36.060
- WELL, WHAT IF I DON'T FEEL
A CONNECTION?

00:36.100 --> 00:38.580
- YOU WILL.

00:44.490 --> 00:46.890

00:53.190 --> 00:56.830
- OH, YOU KNOW,
FROZEN ORANGE JUICE AND STUFF.

00:56.880 --> 00:58.916
- IT STINKS.

00:58.950 --> 00:59.917
- HEY, UH,

00:59.950 --> 01:01.770
STAY CLOSE.

01:01.820 --> 01:03.629

DO YOU THINK?

01:03.680 --> 01:06.911
- YEAH, YEAH,

01:06.960 --> 01:09.053
YOU EVEN KNOW
WHO THESE BELONG TO?

01:09.100 --> 01:10.920
- OF COURSE.

01:10.960 --> 01:12.234
UM, YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:12.270 --> 01:13.680
I THINK KRISTINA
LEFI' THEM HERE.

01:13.720 --> 01:14.857
- YEAH, VERY FUNNY.

01:14.900 --> 01:17.061
HEY, I KNOW WE'RE DOING

BUT ARE YOU SURE

01:19.900 --> 01:22.039

AT OUR HOUSE?

01:22.080 --> 01:26.289
- OH, YOU DON'T THINK
I CAN HANDLE IT.

01:26.320 --> 01:29.187
- YOU KNOW WHAT'S GONNA BE
GOOD FOR YOU?

01:29.220 --> 01:32.257
YOU'RE GONNA GET TO
HAVE YOUR SON HERE WITH YOU

01:32.290 --> 01:35.566
AND YOU GET TO
WATCH HIM SLEEP

01:35.610 --> 01:37.987
AND JUST SEE HOW INNOCENT
AND VULNERABLE AND--

01:38.020 --> 01:39.988
- AND PEACEFUL?

01:40.030 --> 01:43.022
- YEAH.

01:43.060 --> 01:44.436
- YEAH, YOU KNOW,

01:44.480 --> 01:48.029
I'VE DATED SOME WILD WOMEN,
SOME REAL HELLCATS.

01:48.070 --> 01:50.584
BUT, YOU KNOW,
WHEN THEY FINALLY PASS OUT,

01:50.620 --> 01:53.726
IT'S LIKE THEY TURN
INTO THESE LITTLE KI'I'I'ENS,

01:53.760 --> 01:56.581
ALL PURRY AND WARM, AND--

01:56.630 --> 01:59.599
SO YOU KNOW, I KNOW

02:03.050 --> 02:04.938
I FEEL YA.

02:04.980 --> 02:05.901
- ARE YOU SURE?

02:05.950 --> 02:08.009
DO YOU WANT SOMETHING?
- OH, NO, NO, NO.

02:08.050 --> 02:09.494
- OH, OH, SORRY.
I'M SO SORRY.

02:09.540 --> 02:10.609
I'M JUST GONNA

02:10.640 --> 02:12.699

02:12.750 --> 02:14.980

AT HADDIE'S HIGH SCHOOL.

08:27.020 --> 08:28.601
- JUNIOR.
- WHAT ELSE? WHAT ELSE?

08:28.640 --> 08:30.813
WHAT ELSE?
- WELL, HE'S GOT A RAP SHEET.

08:30.850 --> 08:32.738
- THAT'S NOT FUNNY.
- IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.839
- OKAY, LOOK,
THEY'RE FACEBOOK OFFICIAL.

08:34.890 --> 08:36.289
THEY'RE NOT
ELOPING TO VEGAS.

08:36.340 --> 08:38.058
- FACEBOOK OFFICIAL?

08:38.100 --> 08:42.025
- IT'S NOT A SUICIDE PACT,
THEY'RE JUST DATING.

08:42.070 --> 08:44.652
- HOW MUCH MASTURBATING
IS TOO MUCH?

08:44.690 --> 08:46.100
- UH, I'M SORRY, WHAT?

08:46.140 --> 08:48.108
- FOR--
FOR DREW?

08:48.140 --> 08:51.268
HE'S IN THE BATHROOM,
LIKE, A LOT.

08:51.320 --> 08:52.764
LIKE, SIX OR SEVEN TIMES
A DAY.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.552
- THAT--LOOK, SARAH,
THAT'S TOTALLY NORMAL, OKAY?

08:54.600 --> 08:55.760
SO...
- IS IT TOO MUCH?

08:55.810 --> 08:56.947
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

08:56.980 --> 08:58.322
- LOOK, I'VE GOT PROBLEMS
OF MY OWN, OKAY?

08:58.360 --> 08:59.634
HADDIE HAS A BOYFRIEND.

08:59.670 --> 09:00.978
- OF COURSE HADDIE'S
GOT A BOYFRIEND.

09:01.020 --> 09:02.328
SHE'S 15, SHE'S CUTE, ADAM.
DON'T BE A DORK.

09:02.360 --> 09:03.873
- YEAH, OKAY,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:03.920 --> 09:05.911
THEY'RE FACEBOOK OFFICIAL,
AND--AND, YOU KNOW,

09:05.950 --> 09:07.815
SHE HASN'T SAID ANYTHING
TO KRISTINA AND I ABOUT IT.

09:07.850 --> 09:09.363
- WELL, OF COURSE SHE DOESN'T
TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT.

09:09.410 --> 09:10.854
THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

09:10.890 --> 09:13.120
I'VE GOT A KID WHO I'M AFRAID
MIGHT INJURE HIMSELF.

09:13.170 --> 09:16.162
IT'S THE ONE TIME
I COULD ACTUALLY USE SOME HELP

09:16.210 --> 09:18.269
FROM HIS LAME FATHER
WHO WON'T CALL ME BACK.

09:18.310 --> 09:20.824
YOU KNOW, WITH AMBER,
SHE GOT HER PERIOD,

09:20.870 --> 09:21.939
I SAID,
"YOU OKAY?"

09:21.970 --> 09:23.107
SHE SAID,
"SCREW YOU."

09:23.140 --> 09:25.142
SHE WAS FINE,
BUT HIM I JUST...

09:25.180 --> 09:26.169
- SO...

09:26.220 --> 09:28.074
- I CAN'T BE THE MAN
FOR HIM, YOU KNOW?

09:28.110 --> 09:30.453
- OH, YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT IT.

09:30.500 --> 09:31.569
- OH, GOD, ADAM,
WOULD YOU?

09:31.600 --> 09:33.113
- YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
NO PROBLEM.

09:33.150 --> 09:35.323
- JUST DON'T MAKE HIM
FEEL WEIRD, OKAY?

09:35.360 --> 09:36.736
HE'S JUST SO SENSITIVE.

09:36.780 --> 09:38.702
JUST TELL HIM
THAT IT'S NORMAL

09:38.750 --> 09:41.014
OR ALMOST NORMAL
AND HE'S BECOMING A MAN.

09:41.060 --> 09:42.288
- I'M GONNA WELCOME HIM
TO THE CLUB.

09:42.340 --> 09:43.716
- YEAH.
- ALL THAT STUFF.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.093
- JUST BE POSITIVE
AND ENCOURAGE HIM

09:46.130 --> 09:48.576
TO EXPRESS HIMSELF
IN OTHER WAYS TOO, YOU KNOW?

09:48.620 --> 09:50.679
- WHAT, LIKE,
DOWNLOADING PORN?

09:50.720 --> 09:54.349
- OH, GOD.
- THAT'S OUTSIDE THE SHOWER.

09:54.380 --> 09:55.824
- HEY, SARAH.
- OH, YEAH, GOOD.

09:55.870 --> 09:57.519

WE NEED TO TALK HERE.

09:57.560 --> 09:58.697
- OKAY, I GO'I'I'A GET TO WORK,

09:58.730 --> 09:59.549

ARE YOU AWARE

10:00.870 --> 10:03.100
THAT WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A DROUGHT?

10:03.150 --> 10:04.424
- WHAT? NO.

10:04.460 --> 10:08.282
- WELL, SOMEBODY IN THE HOUSE
IS USING AN AWFUL LOT OF WATER.

10:08.330 --> 10:10.776
- OH, YEAH, THAT.

10:10.810 --> 10:12.675
- SO FROM
AN ENVIRONMENTAL STANDPOINT,

10:12.710 --> 10:14.678
I WAS THINKING, UH,
WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING.

10:14.710 --> 10:16.814
- YEAH, I'M AS GREEN
AS THE NEXT PERSON, DAD.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.124
BUT HE'S A 14-YEAR-OLD BOY,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.617
- THAT'S WHY I WOULD
LIKE TO TALK TO HIM

10:20.650 --> 10:22.129
MANO A MANO.

10:22.170 --> 10:23.956
- OH, NO.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.025
I STILL BEAR
THE EMOTIONAL SCARS

10:26.070 --> 10:28.470
OF THE LITTLE TALK WE HAD
WHEN I WAS A KID.

10:28.520 --> 10:30.033
AND THAT WAS
A LONG, LONG TIME AGO.

10:30.070 --> 10:31.822
DON'T SAY ANYTHING TO HIM,
PLEASE.

10:31.870 --> 10:33.929
- WELL, SWEETHEART,
THIS IS NOT WOMEN'S WORK.

10:33.970 --> 10:36.143
- YEAH, WAY TO BE PROGRESSIVE,
DAD.

10:36.180 --> 10:37.761
- COME ON, HONEY,
I'M A GRANDFATHER,

10:37.800 --> 10:39.210
THAT'S WHAT GRANDFATHERS
ARE FOR.

10:39.250 --> 10:40.182

10:40.220 --> 10:42.939

YOU HAVE BEEN GOING OUT

12:59.880 --> 13:01.393

13:04.990 --> 13:06.127
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

13:06.160 --> 13:09.288
IT'S A VIOLATION

LET ALONE HAVE A DATE NIGHT.

14:16.710 --> 14:19.019
- YEAH, 'CAUSE JOEL SAID
YOU CANCELED BECAUSE, UM,

14:19.060 --> 14:22.473
SHE DOESN'T KNOW THE AREA.

14:22.510 --> 14:23.989
- YEAH, WELL, I MEAN,
IT WAS A COMBINATION

14:24.030 --> 14:26.089
OF THAT AND THE WORK,
YOU KNOW.

14:26.140 --> 14:29.200
- MM-HMM.
MM-HMM.

14:29.240 --> 14:32.175
SHE WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED.

14:32.210 --> 14:34.030
- SHE WAS?

14:34.080 --> 14:35.581
- SHE THINKS THAT
YOU DON'T THINK

14:35.630 --> 14:37.348
SHE'S RESPONSIBLE
OR CAPABLE.

14:37.390 --> 14:39.938
- SHE DIDN'T SOUND
DISAPPOINTED

14:39.980 --> 14:41.459
WHEN I TALKED TO HER.

14:41.500 --> 14:42.876
- SHE WAS,
SHE WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED,

14:42.910 --> 14:44.252
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
BACK IN FRESNO

14:44.290 --> 14:46.087
SHE WAS A REALLY
POPULAR BABYSITTER.

14:46.120 --> 14:48.873
EVERYBODY CALLED HER.
SHE WAS THE GO-TO GIRL.

14:48.920 --> 14:51.957
- I DID NOT KNOW THAT.

14:51.990 --> 14:56.745
- WELL, NOW YOU DO.

14:56.790 --> 14:58.337
- SARAH.

15:01.790 --> 15:03.587
SORRY.

15:05.970 --> 15:09.929

15:24.640 --> 15:25.709
- HOW'S IT GOING, DREW?

15:25.750 --> 15:27.365
- HEY.

15:28.510 --> 15:32.401
- AW, GRANDPA MADE ME
DO THE SAME THING

15:32.440 --> 15:33.304
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE.

15:33.340 --> 15:36.161
WASH HIS OLD TRUCK.
SUCKS.

15:36.210 --> 15:38.269
- YEAH.

15:38.310 --> 15:40.585
- HOW'S EVERYTHING ELSE?

15:44.350 --> 15:48.423
- YEAH, I HATED
WASHING THE OLD TRUCK.

15:48.460 --> 15:50.769
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING
I REALLY ENJOYED DOING

15:50.810 --> 15:52.016
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE.

15:52.050 --> 15:53.358
- OH, YEAH?
WHAT?

15:53.400 --> 15:55.015
- AND IT'S NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF.

15:55.050 --> 15:57.223
IT'S TOTALLY NATURAL.

15:57.260 --> 15:59.080
YOU KNOW,
WOODY ALLEN SAID, UH,

15:59.130 --> 16:01.360
"MASTURBATION IS HAVING SEX
WITH SOMEBODY YOU LOVE."

16:01.400 --> 16:03.436
- WHAT? DID MY MOM ASK YOU
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS?

16:03.470 --> 16:05.165
- NO, NO, I MEAN,
SHE MAY HAVE MENTIONED IT.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.191
BUT I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT

16:07.240 --> 16:09.515
BECAUSE, DREW,
IT'S TOTALLY NORMAL, OKAY?

16:09.550 --> 16:11.586
AND I WANNA MAKE SURE
YOU DON'T FEEL WEIRD ABOUT IT

16:11.620 --> 16:15.898
AND WE CAN JUST,
YOU KNOW, AIR IT OUT.

16:15.940 --> 16:17.134
- AIR IT OUT?

16:17.180 --> 16:18.272
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE

16:18.320 --> 16:19.867
THERE'S NO STIGMA
ATTACHED TO IT,

16:19.900 --> 16:21.310
LIKE, HAIR GROWING
ON YOUR PALMS.

16:21.350 --> 16:23.420
- YEAH, YEAH, CAN WE JUST
NOT TALK AND JUST SAY WE DID?

16:23.460 --> 16:25.257
- YEAH, BUT I--

16:25.290 --> 16:27.349
I JUST WANTED YOU
TO KNOW THAT YOU CAN

16:27.400 --> 16:29.425
TALK TO ME ABOUT ANYTHING,
ALL RIGHT?

16:29.470 --> 16:32.257
LIKE, PIMPLES, GIRLS,
BIRTH CONTROL.

16:32.300 --> 16:34.359
YOU KNOW ABOUT RUBBERS, RIGHT?
PROPHYLACTICS?

16:34.400 --> 16:36.265
- LOOK, WE CAN
JUST NOT TALK TOO, RIGHT?

16:36.300 --> 16:37.813
- YEAH!
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

16:37.850 --> 16:40.193
NO BIG DEAL.

16:40.240 --> 16:42.401
OKAY, WELL, YOU JUST, UH,
YOU KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.

16:42.440 --> 16:43.782
WITH THE WASHING THE TRUCK,
I MEAN,

16:43.830 --> 16:46.719
NOT THE--OR--OR THE OTHER
THING TOO IF YOU WANT,

16:46.760 --> 16:48.489
'CAUSE, UH...

16:48.520 --> 16:52.627
ALL RIGHT,
I'M GLAD WE HAD THIS TALK.

16:54.490 --> 16:57.175
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
I HAD NO CHOICE.

16:57.220 --> 16:59.074
SARAH STARTED ASKING
ABOUT OTHER NIGHTS

16:59.120 --> 17:00.974
AMBER COULD BABYSIT
AND I COULDN'T THINK OF

17:01.020 --> 17:02.874
ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY.

17:02.910 --> 17:04.946
SO MEA CULPA.
I TOTALLY BLEW IT.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.732
- OH, OH, NO,
IT'S FINE.

17:06.780 --> 17:09.192
I BLEW IT TOO.
- YOU DID?

17:09.230 --> 17:12.984
WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE
CANCELED IN THE FIRST PLACE.

17:13.030 --> 17:15.498
- WAIT, SO NOW
WE TRUST AMBER.

17:15.550 --> 17:17.780
- SHE IS A
VERY EXPERIENCED BABYSITTER.

17:17.820 --> 17:19.515
- YEAH, SAYS YOUR SISTER.

17:19.550 --> 17:21.609
- I TRUST MY SISTER.

17:21.660 --> 17:24.128
- OH, GEEZ, I'M SORRY.
I FORGOT THE CARDINAL RULE.

17:24.180 --> 17:26.694
ONLY A BRAVERMAN CAN
CRITICIZE ANOTHER BRAVERMAN.

17:26.730 --> 17:28.584
- ALL RIGHT,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:28.630 --> 17:30.029
I'M SORRY.

17:30.080 --> 17:31.172
THAT'S A--
THAT'S A TOTAL DOUBLE STANDARD.

17:31.220 --> 17:32.380
- THANK YOU.

17:32.430 --> 17:36.457
- ONE ABOUT WHICH
WE CAN NOTHING.

17:36.500 --> 17:38.218
- HEY,
SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

17:38.260 --> 17:40.080
- I WAS THINKING THAT WE
SHOULD CALL AMBER

17:40.120 --> 17:42.156
AND SEE IF SHE CAN
STILL COME OVER TONIGHT.

17:42.190 --> 17:43.259
- YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

17:43.300 --> 17:45.700
- NO, BUT I'M OPTIMISTIC.

17:45.750 --> 17:48.366
- YEAH, SO AM I.

17:48.410 --> 17:50.093
- GOOD.
- GOOD, DATE NIGHT.

17:50.130 --> 17:51.370
- YAY.

17:51.410 --> 17:52.991
- SO HOW DID IT GO?
WHAT HAPPENED?

17:53.030 --> 17:54.167
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

17:54.210 --> 17:56.758
- I DID OKAY, CONSIDERING.
- REALLY?

17:56.790 --> 17:59.657
YOU DIDN'T USE
THE WORD THOUGH, DID YOU?

17:59.690 --> 18:00.588
- WHY?

18:00.630 --> 18:02.689
- BECAUSE
IT'S JUST SO CLINICAL.

18:02.730 --> 18:05.597
YOU KNOW?
MASTU RBATE.

18:05.630 --> 18:07.666
- UH, YOU THINK IT'S TIME
TO LET HADDIE OUT OF HER ROOM?

18:07.700 --> 18:09.668
- IT'S AGAINST THE RULES
TO EAT PEANUT BUTTER

18:09.700 --> 18:11.668
OUT OF THE JAR, DAD.

18:11.710 --> 18:13.359
- YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT,
BUDDY.

18:13.400 --> 18:15.049
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
- DOES THAT MEAN I CAN?

18:15.090 --> 18:16.978
- NO, THAT MEANS
THAT DAD CANNOT.

18:17.020 --> 18:18.248
HE CANNOT.
YOU BROKE THE RULE.

18:18.300 --> 18:19.676
I--I BROKE THE RULE.

18:19.710 --> 18:21.359
-HE BROKE THE RULE.
- I BROKE THE RULE.

18:21.410 --> 18:22.365
- HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT,
CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

18:22.410 --> 18:25.379
CAN YOU TELL YOUR SISTER
TO COME DOWNSTAIRS?

18:25.410 --> 18:27.640
- NO.

18:27.690 --> 18:28.714
- WHY NOT?

18:28.760 --> 18:31.069
- 'CAUSE SHE'S NOT UPSTAIRS.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.828
- YEAH, SHE IS, HONEY.
SHE'S IN HER ROOM.

18:32.870 --> 18:34.622
- NO, SHE'S NOT.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.461
- YO-YO LIVES HERE?

18:48.500 --> 18:50.559
- HONEY, DON'T JUDGE A BOOK
BY ITS COVER.

18:50.610 --> 18:52.396
YOU CAN COOK METH ANYWHERE.
I TOLD YOU THAT.

18:52.440 --> 18:53.816
[indistinct chatter]

18:53.850 --> 18:55.329
- I'M OUT.
- UH, KRISTINA.

18:55.370 --> 18:56.439
KRISTINA!
- YOU'RE ADAM BRAVERMAN.

18:56.480 --> 18:58.641

KRISTINA AND MAX.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.240

19:13.490 --> 19:15.481
- YEAH, WE JUST LOVE HER

19:15.530 --> 19:17.213
- OH, SO, UH,

19:17.250 --> 19:19.457
- HERE?
NO, NO, NEITHER IS STEVIE.

19:19.500 --> 19:20.569
- WOULD YOU LIKE
TO COME IN?

19:20.600 --> 19:23.353
SEEING AS HOW WE ARE
FACEBOOK OFFICIALLY RELATED.

19:23.400 --> 19:24.389
- YEAH, THERE'S THAT.

19:24.430 --> 19:25.988
THANK YOU.
THAT'S NICE.

19:26.020 --> 19:28.705
- MAX, PLEASE DON'T PULL
THE PETALS OFF THE FLOWERS.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.502
- OH, NO, NO, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S FINE.

19:30.540 --> 19:34.021
WE UNDERSTAND, HADDIE'S, UH,

WITH MAX.

19:38.380 --> 19:41.998
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

19:42.040 --> 19:44.008
- UH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT'S FUNNY,

19:44.040 --> 19:45.029
WE WERE JUST IN THE--

19:45.080 --> 19:46.411
- CHECKING US OUT?

19:46.460 --> 19:47.484
I GET IT. I GET IT.
- YES. YEAH.

19:47.530 --> 19:49.145
- YOU CAUGHT ME.
- I UNDERSTAND.

19:49.180 --> 19:50.249
- YOU GOT ME.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.803
- IF I HAD A DAUGHTER,
I'D WANNA KNOW WHERE SHE'S

19:51.840 --> 19:53.000
SPENDING HER TIME TOO.

19:53.050 --> 19:54.426
YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING.
- YEAH, THAT'S ALL.

19:54.460 --> 19:55.461
- IT'S FINE, DON'T WORRY.
- YEAH, OKAY.

19:55.500 --> 19:58.321
- OKAY, YOU ARE THE ONE
THAT SHOULD BE PISSED.

19:58.360 --> 20:00.180
THEY WERE WAY OUT OF LINE.

20:00.230 --> 20:01.879
- SO THEN, WHAT DO I DO
WHEN THEY START

20:01.920 --> 20:04.434
INTERROGATING ME AGAIN?

20:04.470 --> 20:05.505
- WELL, FIRST YOU HAVE
TO ACKNOWLEDGE

20:05.540 --> 20:07.428
WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM.

20:07.480 --> 20:08.959
IT'S THEIR JOB
TO MAKE YOUR LIFE MISERABLE.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.514
- OKAY, SO WHAT'S MY JOB?

20:11.550 --> 20:13.279
- TO KEEP THEM
OUT OF YOUR PERSONAL LIFE

20:13.310 --> 20:14.516
FOR AS LONG AS
HUMANLY POSSIBLE,

20:14.550 --> 20:16.029
WHICH ISN'T GONNA BE EASY.

20:16.070 --> 20:18.584
TH EY'RE--TH EY'RE LIKE TERMITES.
THEY'RE RELENTLESS.

20:18.630 --> 20:22.623
- SO THEN WHAT CAN I DO
TO MAKE THEM STOP?

20:22.660 --> 20:25.379
- DECEPTION.
MISIN FORMATION.

20:25.430 --> 20:28.285
YOU FLAT OUT LIE TO THEIR FACE
IF YOU HAVE TO.

20:28.330 --> 20:30.901
ALTHOUGH THAT DOES
TEND TO BACKFIRE.

20:30.950 --> 20:32.463
REALLY GETS THEM RILED UP.

20:32.500 --> 20:36.675
JUST REMEMBER, THEY
BROUGHT THIS ON THEMSELVES.

20:49.690 --> 20:50.588
- HEY.
- HEY.

20:50.620 --> 20:52.485
- THANKS FOR RESPONDING
TO MY A.P.B.

20:52.520 --> 20:53.896
- NO PROBLEM.
HOW ARE YOU?

20:53.940 --> 20:55.384
- GREAT.
- YEAH?

20:55.420 --> 20:57.866
- YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY?

20:57.910 --> 20:59.901
- UH, HOW ABOUT,
"GET THE HELL IN THE CAR"?

20:59.940 --> 21:01.521
- GREAT OPENER.

21:01.570 --> 21:02.696
BUT Al-TER THAT,
WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?

21:02.740 --> 21:04.492
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
- I DON'T HAVE A PLAN, SARAH.

21:04.530 --> 21:06.634
- NO?
HAVE YOU MET THIS GUY?

21:06.670 --> 21:08.228
- NO, I JUST HEARD
HIS VOICE ON THE PHONE.

21:08.260 --> 21:10.012
HE'S ONE OF THESE
"YO, YO, YO" GUYS.

21:10.060 --> 21:12.528
- THAT'S BAD.
- YEAH, GOT THAT.

21:12.580 --> 21:15.094
- DO YOU THINK
THEY'RE HAVING SEX?

21:15.130 --> 21:16.336
- HADDIE IS 15.

21:16.370 --> 21:19.305
- AMBER WAS 15
WHEN SHE HOOKED UP WITH DAMIEN.

21:19.340 --> 21:20.853
- AND THEY WERE--
- YES, THEY WERE.

21:20.900 --> 21:24.893
SHE WANTED TO MOVE IN WITH HIM
AND START THEIR LIVES TOGETHER.

21:24.930 --> 21:26.557
- WELL, I DON'T THINK
HADDIE'S THERE YET.

21:26.590 --> 21:27.796
I MEAN,
I'M SURE SHE'S NOT.

21:27.830 --> 21:31.459
SO...POSITIVE, IN FACT.
- OKAY, OKAY.

21:31.490 --> 21:33.287
I BELIEVE YOU.

21:33.320 --> 21:35.356
BUT IT'S RIGHT AROUND
THE CORNER

21:35.390 --> 21:36.948
AND YOU HAVE TO DO
EVERYTHING YOU CAN

21:36.980 --> 21:39.323
TO POSTPONE IT.

21:39.360 --> 21:40.497
DO YOU KNOW
HOW TO DO THAT?

21:40.540 --> 21:41.768
- NO, WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST?

21:41.810 --> 21:43.539
- MY GOD, YOU HAVE TO
SHUT THEM DOWN.

21:43.570 --> 21:45.629
NO PHONE,
NO EMAIL, NO COMPUTER,

21:45.680 --> 21:47.739
NO TEXTING,
NO LEAVING THE HOUSE,

21:47.780 --> 21:49.532
NO NOTHING,
AND THEN WHEN THAT FAILS,

21:49.580 --> 21:51.309
YOU JUST GO TO PLAN B.

21:51.340 --> 21:54.377
- WHICH IS WHAT?
- MOVE.

21:54.410 --> 21:56.651
- THANKS FOR THAT.

21:56.690 --> 21:59.545
- WELCOME TO MY WORLD,
BROTHER.

22:02.180 --> 22:04.205
- I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU WOULD
JUST SNEAK OUT LIKE THAT.

22:04.250 --> 22:07.242
- I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT YOU
WOULD HACK INTO MY COMPUTER.

22:07.290 --> 22:08.427
- I HACKED INTO YOUR COMPUTER

22:08.460 --> 22:09.734
TO FIND OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU.

22:09.770 --> 22:12.421
- WHAT IF I DON'T WANT YOU TO
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH ME?

22:12.460 --> 22:14.280
- I DON'T CARE, HADDIE,
I'M YOUR FATHER.

22:14.330 --> 22:15.399
I HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW.

22:15.430 --> 22:17.045
- I HAVE A RIGHT
TO MY PRIVACY.

22:17.090 --> 22:18.318
- NOT IN MY HOUSE,
YOU DON'T.

22:18.370 --> 22:19.359
- OKAY.

22:19.400 --> 22:21.220
- MAYBE IT'S DIFFERENT
OVER AT STEVE'S HOUSE

22:21.270 --> 22:25.434
WITH MARJORIE AND DALE.

22:25.480 --> 22:27.857
- YOU DIDN'T.

22:27.890 --> 22:29.232
- OH, WHERE DID YOU
THINK WE'D GO

22:29.270 --> 22:30.646
WHEN WE COULDN'T FIND OUT
WHERE YOU WERE?

22:30.690 --> 22:31.588
- DAD!

22:31.620 --> 22:33.508
- WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT YOU,
HADDIE.

22:33.550 --> 22:36.519
- OH--OH, MY GOD.

22:36.560 --> 22:37.766
- THEY KNEW EVERYTHING
ABOUT US,

22:37.800 --> 22:41.213
AND WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THEY EXISTED.

22:41.250 --> 22:43.935
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT FELT?

22:46.500 --> 22:48.968
- PROBABLY AS BAD
AS IT FEELS FINDING OUT THAT

22:49.020 --> 22:50.533
YOUR PARENTS HAVE NO RESPECT
FOR YOUR PRIVACY.

22:50.570 --> 22:51.389
- FINE, YOU KNOW WHAT,
THAT'S IT.

22:51.430 --> 22:53.944
NO MORE CELL PHONE,
NO MORE TEXTING.

22:53.990 --> 22:55.389
YOU GO TO SCHOOL.
YOU COME HOME FROM SCHOOL.

22:55.440 --> 22:56.509
THAT'S THE WAY
IT'S GONNA BE.

22:56.540 --> 22:58.155
- YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING ME.
- I AM NOT KIDDING.

22:58.200 --> 23:02.022
DO I LOOK LIKE
I'M KIDDING?

23:13.770 --> 23:17.388
- AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST
IS POISON CONTROL CENTER SO...

23:17.430 --> 23:18.829
- THINK I GOT IT.
- GREAT.

23:18.880 --> 23:19.699
OKAY.

23:19.740 --> 23:23.324
OH, UM,
AND WE'RE GOOD

23:23.360 --> 23:25.499
WITH THE WHOLE
SCHEDULING SNAFU?

23:25.540 --> 23:27.360
- YEAH, IT WAS, LIKE,
NOT A BIG DEAL AT ALL.

23:27.400 --> 23:30.051
- YOUR MOM SAID
YOU WERE PRETTY UPSET.

23:30.090 --> 23:31.717
- SHE DID?

23:36.440 --> 23:39.238
I PROBABLY OVERREACT ED
OR SOMETHING.

23:39.270 --> 23:42.205
- GREAT.
[clearing throat]

23:42.240 --> 23:43.992
- HI.

24:29.500 --> 24:33.152

24:49.620 --> 24:51.508
- I COULD ALWAYS
TALK TO HADDIE.

24:51.550 --> 24:54.110
ALWAYS.

24:54.140 --> 24:56.552
- HONEY, REBELLING, IT'S--

24:56.590 --> 25:02.005
IT'S JUST PART OF GROWING UP,
YOU KNOW?

25:02.050 --> 25:05.213
- SHE HATES ME.

25:05.260 --> 25:06.329
- SHE DOESN'T HATE YOU.

25:06.360 --> 25:08.703
SHE LOVES YOU MORE
THAN ANYBODY ELSE

25:08.740 --> 25:11.015
IN THIS ENTIRE WORLD
AND YOU KNOW IT.

25:11.060 --> 25:13.290
- DO I?
DO I REALLY?

25:13.330 --> 25:15.059
- YES.

25:15.090 --> 25:17.194
BUT HONEY, THAT'S NOT GONNA
LAST FOREVER, YOU KNOW?

25:17.230 --> 25:20.199
SHE'S GONNA GROW UP,
SHE'S GONNA FALL IN LOVE.

25:20.240 --> 25:21.195
FOR REAL.

25:21.240 --> 25:23.276
- NO, NOT WITH THAT KID
YO-YO, SHE'S NOT.

25:23.310 --> 25:24.993

25:28.380 --> 25:33.556
WELL, YOU KNOW,
IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION,

25:34.460 --> 25:35.904
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE
THE MOST IMPORTANT MAN

25:35.940 --> 25:38.317
IN MY LIFE.

25:38.360 --> 25:39.349
- REALLY?

25:39.390 --> 25:42.279

25:48.850 --> 25:50.090
- HOW DO YOU
LIKE YOUR DOGS--

25:50.130 --> 25:54.305
MEDIUM, WELL DONE,
OR BURNT TO A CRISP?

25:55.830 --> 25:58.378
UH-OH,
WE GOT A PROBLEM THERE?

25:58.410 --> 26:00.162
- IT'S STUCK.

26:00.210 --> 26:03.896
- WELL, WHY'D YOU
PUT YOUR THUMB IN THE CAN?

26:03.940 --> 26:05.794
- I DON'T KNOW.
- MM-HMM.

26:05.840 --> 26:08.764
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
LET ME TAKE A GANDER HERE.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.483

WOW, THAT'S REALLY IN THERE,

26:12.290 --> 26:13.450
OKAY.

26:13.500 --> 26:15.388
HEY, I KNOW JUST THE THING.

26:15.430 --> 26:16.658
NOT TO WORRY.

26:16.710 --> 26:18.325
FOLLOW ME.

26:18.360 --> 26:22.228
ONE, TWO, THREE!

26:22.270 --> 26:23.498
- OKAY, SORRY, SORRY, SORRY.

26:23.540 --> 26:25.508
UM, OKAY, WE GOT
A LITTLE BLOOD HERE.

26:25.540 --> 26:28.748
UM, NOTHING
TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT.

26:28.790 --> 26:30.610
- I CAN'T FEEL MY THUMB.

26:30.650 --> 26:32.789
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

26:32.830 --> 26:37.346
OKAY, UM.
OKAY, UM...

26:37.380 --> 26:38.790

27:11.560 --> 27:13.209
- I--I WORK SO MUCH.

27:13.250 --> 27:16.037
I CAN'T STAND TO LEAVE HARMONY
ALONE WITH A BABYSI'ITER.

27:16.080 --> 27:18.002
- OH, SURE, SURE.
THAT'S COMMENDABLE.

27:18.050 --> 27:19.005
- RIGHT.

27:19.050 --> 27:21.041

27:36.720 --> 27:38.403
PICK UP.

27:38.440 --> 27:42.069

27:42.100 --> 27:43.510
[phone ringing]

27:43.550 --> 27:48.249

THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
PLAN B.

27:52.390 --> 27:53.618

27:53.670 --> 27:56.639
- OH, BUDDY,
IT'S--IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

27:56.670 --> 27:57.659
COME ON!

27:57.710 --> 27:59.940
OKAY.

28:06.750 --> 28:08.058
[sneezing]

28:08.100 --> 28:11.991
- OH, HI.
SORRY, YOU SCARED ME.

28:12.030 --> 28:13.759
DON'T WORRY,
IT'S MY SISTER'S HOUSE.

28:13.790 --> 28:16.338
AND I'M--
WE'RE PLAYING A GAME.

28:16.380 --> 28:18.166
OKAY, HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

28:26.320 --> 28:28.311
- CAN YOU DO IT LIKE THAT?
- OF COURSE.

28:28.360 --> 28:31.944
[cell phone ringing]

28:43.160 --> 28:44.297

28:44.340 --> 28:45.568

28:45.620 --> 28:46.848

28:46.890 --> 28:51.168
DON'T LET ME DOWN.

28:51.210 --> 28:54.031
- NO, BUT NOT DOUG,
NOT DOUGIE, DOUGLAS?

28:54.070 --> 28:55.651
- HE'S A SEMIOTICS
PROFESSOR.

28:55.690 --> 28:58.102
- OKAY, WELL...

28:58.150 --> 28:59.902
SHE'S EATING
BOUILLABAISSE, JOEL.

28:59.940 --> 29:00.929
WHAT KIND OF KID
EATS BOUILLABAISSE?

29:00.980 --> 29:02.174
- OH, MAN,
YOU ARE SO BAD.

29:02.220 --> 29:06.350
- BUT, I MEAN, SYDNEY WON'T
EVEN EAT MY MAC AND CHEESE.

29:06.390 --> 29:09.393
CROSBY?

29:09.430 --> 29:12.115
WHAT HOSPITAL?

29:12.160 --> 29:13.252
- DATE OF BIRTH?

29:13.300 --> 29:16.428
- UM, UH, FIVE.

29:16.470 --> 29:19.337
HE'S FIVE.

29:19.370 --> 29:20.405
- ADDRESS?

29:20.440 --> 29:22.192
- MINE OR--
- HIS.

29:22.240 --> 29:23.514
- UM, YEAH.

29:23.550 --> 29:25.165
IT'S--IT'S COM PLICATED, SO...

29:25.210 --> 29:26.370
- HEY.

29:26.410 --> 29:28.378
- OH, THANK GOD.

29:28.420 --> 29:29.580
- WHO'S THIS?

29:29.620 --> 29:32.896
- THIS IS JABBAR.

29:36.250 --> 29:38.810
MY SON.

29:45.810 --> 29:47.084
- HI.
- HI.

29:47.130 --> 29:49.769
- YOU FORGOT YOUR, UH,
BIOLOGY TEXT BOOK.

29:49.820 --> 29:50.741
- OH.

29:50.780 --> 29:54.739
- SO--WELL, I FIGURED
YOU MIGHT NEED IT.

29:54.790 --> 29:56.098
- WOW, THAT'S SO
CONSIDERATE OF YOU.

29:56.130 --> 29:56.858
THAN KS.

29:56.890 --> 29:58.334
HEY, YOU KNOW
WHAT'S FUNNY?

29:58.380 --> 29:59.995
FOR A SECOND,
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU

30:00.030 --> 30:02.658
WERE CHECKING UP ON ME.

30:02.690 --> 30:05.102
MAYBE AFRAID THAT I WAS GONNA
RAID THE LIQUOR CABINET.

30:05.140 --> 30:06.482
- YOU HAVE NO PROOF OF THAT.

30:06.520 --> 30:08.488
- YOU LIED
TO AUNT JULIA.

30:08.530 --> 30:11.829
YOU SAID THAT I WAS UPSET
BECAUSE I COULDN'T BABYSIT.

30:11.870 --> 30:13.872
- YEAH, 'CAUSE I KNOW
YOU WANTED THE MONEY.

30:13.910 --> 30:15.320
- REALLY?
REALLY?

30:15.360 --> 30:17.396
IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU
TRYING TO PROVE YOURSELF

30:17.430 --> 30:20.081
TO AUNT JULIA?

30:20.120 --> 30:22.532
- WHAT?

30:22.570 --> 30:23.673
- OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

30:23.710 --> 30:25.769
JUST DON'T USE ME
NEXT TIME, OKAY?

30:25.820 --> 30:26.844
- I'M SORRY.

30:26.890 --> 30:31.827
YEAH, SHE JUST MAKES ME FEEL
A LITTLE INSECURE.

30:31.860 --> 30:32.519
- A LITTLE?
- YEAH.

30:32.550 --> 30:34.518
A LITTLE,
LIKE, YOU KNOW,

30:34.550 --> 30:35.653
I'M THE WORLD'S
WORST MOTHER

30:35.690 --> 30:36.964
AND A COMPLETE FAILURE
AT LIFE.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.514
LIKE THAT KIND OF LI'ITLE.

30:42.940 --> 30:44.339
- HEY, SYDNEY,

30:44.390 --> 30:47.803
DO YOU WANNA SHOW AUNT SARAH
WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON?

30:47.840 --> 30:50.525
- OKAY.
- CHECK IT OUT.

30:50.570 --> 30:53.630
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE
LIVING IN THAT CRAPPY MOTEL

30:53.670 --> 30:55.149
AFTER YOU SPLIT UP WITH DAD,

30:55.190 --> 30:57.567
AND WE HAD NO MONEY
AND NO TOYS,

30:57.610 --> 31:00.647
NO NOTHING?

31:00.680 --> 31:02.784
- NO.

31:02.820 --> 31:07.371
- OKAY, WELL,
I DID.

31:10.350 --> 31:12.033
- HERE.

31:17.220 --> 31:20.860
- YOU MADE PAPER TURTLES.

31:24.360 --> 31:26.351
- AMBER TAUGHT ME.

31:29.850 --> 31:32.774
- YOU KNOW WHO TAUGHT AMBER
HOW TO DO THIS?

31:32.820 --> 31:36.745
- SHE TOLD ME YOU DID.

31:36.790 --> 31:39.190
- THAT'S RIGHT.

31:49.800 --> 31:51.483
- HOW ABOUT I MAKE US
SOME DRINKS?

31:51.530 --> 31:56.069
THEY GOT A REALLY NICE
SELECTION OVER THERE.

32:07.510 --> 32:09.432
- SEE THIS?

32:09.470 --> 32:10.539
THIS IS SLITHER CREAM.

32:10.580 --> 32:13.811
ANYTHING THAT'S STUCK
GETS UNSTUCK.

32:13.860 --> 32:15.134
ALL RIGHT,
THERE WE GO.

32:15.170 --> 32:17.058
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS CLOSE YOUR EYES.

32:17.100 --> 32:20.103
ALL RIGHT,
TAKE A DEEP BREATH

32:20.140 --> 32:22.859
AND SAY THE MAGIC WORDS.

32:22.900 --> 32:25.039
SLIPPERY, SLITHER, SLIME.

32:25.080 --> 32:27.696
both: SLIPPERY, SLITHER, SLIME.

32:27.730 --> 32:29.869
- OH, PRESTO!
- OH, YOU GOT IT!

32:29.910 --> 32:31.662
- IT WORKED!
- COME ON!

32:31.700 --> 32:35.215
- IT REALLY WORKED!

32:45.230 --> 32:47.266
- HEY.
- MM-HMM.

32:47.310 --> 32:48.743
- DO YOU THINK
NAILING HADDIE'S WINDOW SHUT

32:48.790 --> 32:51.020
WAS GOING TOO FAR?

32:51.070 --> 32:52.822
- PLEASE TELL ME
YOU WERE NOT THINKING

32:52.860 --> 32:54.589
ABOUT THAT EARLIER.

32:54.620 --> 32:57.180
- NO, OF COURSE NOT.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

32:57.210 --> 32:58.893
- ADAM.
- IT JUST OCCURRED TO ME.

32:58.940 --> 33:00.077
REALLY.
- UH-HUH.

33:00.110 --> 33:01.316
- REALLY.

33:15.850 --> 33:17.579
- HE'S SLEEPING.

33:20.410 --> 33:22.230
SO...

33:24.030 --> 33:25.611
ARE YOU SURE HE'S YOURS?

33:25.650 --> 33:29.438
- WHY, 'CAUSE HE STUCK
HIS FINGER IN A CAN?

33:29.490 --> 33:33.312
- BECAUSE IF HE IS,
YOU HAVE OBLIGATIONS.

33:35.770 --> 33:37.317
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THAT?

33:38.360 --> 33:40.874
- YOU WERE REALLY GREAT
BACK THERE IN THE E.R.

33:40.910 --> 33:44.118
- CROS, THIS CAN BE
A BIG DEAL, OKAY?

33:44.160 --> 33:45.730
- I'M NOT KIDDING.

33:45.780 --> 33:47.634
YOU'RE AN AMAZING MOM.

33:49.850 --> 33:51.647
-IAM?

33:51.680 --> 33:54.604
- YEAH.
LIKE, 100%.

33:58.930 --> 34:00.648
- THANKS.
THANKS FOR CALLING ME.

34:00.690 --> 34:02.134
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
YOU WOULD'VE CALLED

34:02.170 --> 34:05.685
ADAM OR SARAH FIRST.

34:05.730 --> 34:07.755
- AW, THOSE DEADBEATS?

34:07.800 --> 34:09.074
I MEAN, COME ON.

34:09.110 --> 34:14.309
- A MOTHER CAN GIVE YOU
HER BREAST

34:14.360 --> 34:20.663
BUT SOON
THAT'S ALL SHE'LL BRING

34:20.710 --> 34:26.888
AND WHEN SHE'S LEI-T

34:26.920 --> 34:33.302
THAT'S WHEN YOU
LEARN TO SING

34:36.100 --> 34:39.797
A FATHER CAN GIVE
YOU HIS WORDS

34:39.830 --> 34:41.445
- WHEN MY FATHER
FOUND OUT THAT I WAS DATING,

34:41.490 --> 34:43.139
HE NEARLY HAD
A HEART ATTACK.

34:43.180 --> 34:45.626
I MEAN--
- HOW OLD WERE YOU?

34:45.660 --> 34:47.764
- OH, 16.

34:47.800 --> 34:50.007
TREVOR DUNN.

34:50.050 --> 34:51.802
HE WORE A PUKA SHELL NECKLACE.

34:51.840 --> 34:52.829
HE WAS REAL TAN.

34:52.880 --> 34:56.919
- OKAY, UM, DID YOUR DAD
NAIL YOUR WINDOW SHUT?

34:56.950 --> 35:00.158
- HONEY, MY DAD
WAS NOTHING LIKE YOURS.

35:00.200 --> 35:02.919
TRUST ME.

35:02.960 --> 35:04.712
- THE POINT IS,
IS WHEN IT COMES DADS

35:04.750 --> 35:06.547
AND THEIR DAUGHTERS DATING,
IT'S--IT'S, LIKE,

35:06.580 --> 35:07.751
IT'S PRIMORDIAL.

35:07.790 --> 35:09.758
IT'S LIKE THAT LIZARD
PART OF THEIR BRAIN

35:09.790 --> 35:11.166
KICKS IN
AND THEY JUST--

35:11.210 --> 35:13.235
- OKAY, SO BASICALLY,
DAD CAN'T HELP HIMSELF?

35:13.280 --> 35:14.793
- RIGHT.
YEAH.

35:14.830 --> 35:17.628
JUST LIKE YOU CAN'T.

35:17.660 --> 35:19.218
- SO DAD'S JUST GONNA
HATE STEVE

35:19.250 --> 35:20.319
NO MATTER HOW AWESOME
HE IS?

35:20.350 --> 35:21.669
- NO, NO,
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

35:21.700 --> 35:23.622
I THINK THAT
HE'LL COME AROUND EVENTUALLY

35:23.670 --> 35:25.945
IF HE'S AS AWESOME
AS YOU SAY HE IS.

35:25.980 --> 35:26.947
- HE IS.

35:26.980 --> 35:28.208
- HE IS.

35:30.540 --> 35:32.292
- ALL RIGHT.

35:32.330 --> 35:33.638
YOU HAVE
TO PROMISE ME THOUGH,

35:33.680 --> 35:36.262
NO MORE SNEAKING AROUND.

35:36.300 --> 35:41.260
- OKAY.
I'M SORRY.

35:41.310 --> 35:44.962
HOW MAD IS DAD?

35:45.000 --> 35:46.160
- YOU KNOW, HONEY,
I THINK HE'S--

35:46.210 --> 35:48.758
I THINK HE'S MORE SCARED
THAN ANYTHING.

35:48.800 --> 35:52.076
- OF WHAT?

35:52.110 --> 35:56.217
- OF LOSING YOU.

35:56.250 --> 36:03.156
- AND I WANT TO BELIEVE

36:03.190 --> 36:08.366
I KNOW HOW TO BELIEVE

36:13.680 --> 36:16.092
[shower running]

36:16.130 --> 36:17.882
- HEY, DREW.

36:17.930 --> 36:19.136
- WHAT?
- COMING IN.

36:19.170 --> 36:20.853
- HEY, NO, NO, NO!
I'M STILL IN HERE.

36:20.900 --> 36:22.106
- SO, KIDDO,
WE NEED TO TALK

36:22.140 --> 36:24.938
ABOUT SOME WATER CONSERVATION.

36:24.970 --> 36:26.722
- WHAT? NOW?
I DON'T--

36:26.770 --> 36:30.388
- WELL, YOU KNOW, YOUR UNCLES
HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.

36:30.420 --> 36:32.285
ADAM WAS THE WORST.

36:32.320 --> 36:34.140
I THINK HE WAS GONNA SET
SOME KIND OF RECORD.

36:34.190 --> 36:35.418
I ALMOST CALLED GUINNESS.

36:35.460 --> 36:37.348
- CAN WE JUST--
NOT RIGHT NOW?

36:37.400 --> 36:39.982
- WHEN IT COMES
TO TESTOSTERONE,

36:40.020 --> 36:41.567
THE BRAVERMAN MEN
ARE BLESSED

36:41.610 --> 36:44.295
WITH AN ABUNDANCE
OF RICHES, SON.

36:44.340 --> 36:46.092
- GRANDPA.
- PRIDE!

36:46.130 --> 36:49.782
- PRIDE AND GLORY IS WHAT
YOU SHOULD BE FEELING, SON,

36:49.820 --> 36:53.859

I'M DRAGGING

40:15.820 --> 40:18.027
THE SAILS
OF MEMORY

40:18.070 --> 40:20.300
RIP OPEN IN SILENCE

40:20.340 --> 40:22.786
WE CUT THROUGH
THE LOWLANDS

40:22.830 --> 40:25.207
ALL HANDS THROUGH
THE SALTLANDS

40:25.250 --> 40:27.718
THE WHITE CAPS
ARE MEMORIES

40:27.770 --> 40:30.659
CONFUSING
AND VIOLENT

40:49.510 --> 40:53.298
I HAD A DREAM
LAST NIGHT

40:53.340 --> 40:55.444
WHEN I OPENED
MY EYES

40:55.480 --> 40:58.108

IN THE MOONLIGHT

41:00.590 --> 41:02.797
NEW WORLDS
FOR THE WEARY

41:02.830 --> 41:05.549
NEW LANDS
FOR THE LIVING

41:05.600 --> 41:07.454
I COULD MAKE IT
IF I TRIED

41:07.490 --> 41:09.594
I CLOSE MY EYES
I KEPT ON SWIMMING

41:09.630 --> 41:10.904
