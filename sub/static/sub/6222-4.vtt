THE DRAGON: In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

00:05.173 --> 00:10.428
the destiny of a great kingdom
rests on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.511 --> 00:14.390
His name, Merlin.

00:27.737 --> 00:29.488
You know what you need
after a hard day's hunt?

00:29.572 --> 00:31.032
Sleep.

00:31.199 --> 00:33.451
A nice cold tankard of mead.

00:35.203 --> 00:37.455
Mead. (SPURS ON HORSE)

00:55.056 --> 01:00.061
No better place to measure the mood of
your people than the local tavern.

01:00.144 --> 01:02.730
This is one of those moments where |
tell you something isn't a good idea

01:02.813 --> 01:04.397
and you ignore me, isn't it?

01:04.482 --> 01:07.526
You're learning, Merlin.
Slowly, but you're learning.

01:08.236 --> 01:11.322
Now, remember, in here
you're not my servant.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.741
I'm just a simple peasant like
everyone else.

01:16.035 --> 01:18.204
Simple part's right.

01:18.287 --> 01:19.664
What?

01:19.747 --> 01:22.166
| said, the sun is very bright.

01:22.333 --> 01:24.168
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

(BOISTEROUS TALKING)

01:34.804 --> 01:36.264
(RAUCOUS LAUGHTER)

01:37.306 --> 01:39.684
Afternoon. What'll it be?

01:40.351 --> 01:41.352
-Um...
-Mmm.

01:41.477 --> 01:43.521
You're an handsome fellow.

01:44.063 --> 01:46.399
Well, you wouldn't be
the first to say it.

01:46.482 --> 01:48.818
Oh, no, sorry.

01:48.901 --> 01:51.445
| was talking about your friend here.

01:53.698 --> 01:55.157
Him?

01:57.034 --> 01:58.411
Thank you.

01:59.078 --> 02:00.871
Two tankards of mead, please.

02:07.795 --> 02:11.132
| was wrong.
Coming here was a great idea.

02:15.011 --> 02:17.138
(ALL FALL SILENT)

02:21.309 --> 02:23.227
(TRAY CRASHING)

02:24.312 --> 02:26.272
Afternoon, Mary.

02:26.355 --> 02:28.065
Business looks good.

02:28.149 --> 02:29.692
We have our better days.

02:29.775 --> 02:32.445
| don't suppose you'd begrudge
me my share, then.

02:42.705 --> 02:44.540
-And the rest?
-That's all we got.

02:44.623 --> 02:45.875
I'll not ask again!

02:45.958 --> 02:47.835
ARTHUR: Take your hands off her.

03:00.598 --> 03:02.516
I'm gonna make you pay for that.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.393
(CHUCKLES) I'd like to see you try.

03:08.522 --> 03:09.690
(WHISTLING LOUDLY)

03:09.815 --> 03:11.275
(DOOR OPENING)

03:19.325 --> 03:24.288
You had to open your big mouth,
didn't you, Merlin?

03:24.372 --> 03:28.000
You two have got yourselves in a
bit of a pickle,

03:28.084 --> 03:29.418
haven't you?

03:29.835 --> 03:31.879
You should get out of here
while you have the chance.

03:33.464 --> 03:34.757
You're probably right.

03:44.975 --> 03:46.185
(GASPING)

03:55.111 --> 03:56.487
Arthur!

04:01.367 --> 04:03.661

04:37.695 --> 04:39.321
Pass the jug, huh?

04:45.369 --> 04:46.495
What do they call you, then?

04:46.579 --> 04:49.165
-Merlin.
-Gwaine. Pleasure to meet you.

04:50.833 --> 04:52.376
Such a waste, huh?

05:04.221 --> 05:06.724
(SHOUTING LOUDLY)

05:13.105 --> 05:15.399
(GASPING)

05:25.284 --> 05:26.827
How is he?

05:28.162 --> 05:31.290
Not good. He's losing a lot of blood.

05:32.708 --> 05:34.084
(CROWD BOOING)

05:34.168 --> 05:36.253
If this man ever troubles you again,

05:36.337 --> 05:40.299
word is to be sent to Camelot.
Soldiers will be here within a day.

05:40.382 --> 05:42.259
How can you make a promise like that?

05:43.594 --> 05:45.012
Because I'm the King's son,

05:45.846 --> 05:47.014
Prince Arthur.

05:49.099 --> 05:50.476
Prince Arthur?

05:50.935 --> 05:52.978
MARY: Prince Arthur in my tavern?

05:54.355 --> 05:55.564
-Come on!
-CROWD: Yes!

06:47.491 --> 06:49.493
Merlin, fetch me some fresh water,

06:49.660 --> 06:51.370
towels, a needle, and silk thread.

06:51.495 --> 06:52.746
And honey?

06:52.830 --> 06:54.290
You're learning.

06:55.791 --> 06:57.585
Helps fight the infection.

06:58.252 --> 07:01.297
-Will he be all right?
-Providing he's strong.

07:01.839 --> 07:03.173
He's that, all right.

07:04.008 --> 07:05.676
The man saved my life, Gaius.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.430
He's to be given anything he needs.

07:27.072 --> 07:28.741
What am I doing in this bed?

07:28.824 --> 07:30.534
You were wounded.

07:30.618 --> 07:33.245
Arthur wanted to make sure
you were treated by his physician.

07:33.329 --> 07:34.371
Arthur?

07:34.997 --> 07:36.373
Prince Arthur.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.208
You saved his life.

07:38.917 --> 07:42.004
If I'd known who he was,
| probably wouldn't have.

07:42.087 --> 07:43.964
(GROANING)

07:45.924 --> 07:47.259
He's a noble.

07:47.468 --> 07:49.928
-Yeah, but he's a good man.
-(GWAINE CHUCKLING)

07:50.262 --> 07:52.306
If you say so.

07:52.389 --> 07:53.766
You're a hero.

07:53.932 --> 07:55.517
The King wants to thank you,

07:55.601 --> 07:57.353
in person. (GASPING)

07:57.436 --> 07:59.355
Please, no.

08:00.356 --> 08:02.149
I've met a few kings.

08:02.232 --> 08:04.109
Once you've met one you've...
You've met them all.

08:04.193 --> 08:07.071
-He'll probably give you a reward.
-I'm not interested.

08:07.446 --> 08:08.614
Besides,

08:09.490 --> 08:10.741
I've got everything I need

08:11.867 --> 08:12.910
right here.

08:14.244 --> 08:15.746
Why did you help us?

08:15.829 --> 08:18.082
Your chances looked between
slim and none.

08:18.916 --> 08:23.003
[, uh... I guess I just kind of
like the look of those odds.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.297

-How's Gwaine?
-Recovering.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.260
(HORSES APPROACHING)

08:32.763 --> 08:33.931
Who's that?

08:38.434 --> 08:40.979
Ah, Sir Darien.

08:41.813 --> 08:43.440
He's here for the melee.

08:43.982 --> 08:47.611
Oh, yeah. The tournament where the
knights ride around

08:47.695 --> 08:50.698
hitting each other with blunt weapons
for no good reason.

08:51.407 --> 08:52.825
A little more to it than that.

08:53.367 --> 08:54.535
Really?

08:54.618 --> 08:57.246
All I've ever seen is people getting
the seven bells knocked out of them

08:57.329 --> 09:00.124
so that the last man standing
can be called the winner.

09:00.207 --> 09:04.670
The melee is the ultimate test
of strength and courage.

09:05.337 --> 09:07.005
Are you sure we're talking
about the same thing?

09:07.089 --> 09:09.800
Well, I wouldn't expect you
to understand. You're not a knight.

09:09.925 --> 09:12.886
Oh, well, if it means
| don't get clobbered round the head,

09:12.970 --> 09:14.388
I'm glad of it.

09:14.471 --> 09:16.223
I'm afraid it doesn't.

09:17.933 --> 09:19.476
Ow!

09:20.144 --> 09:22.187
| need that lot cleaned by noon.

09:24.314 --> 09:25.566
(GROANING)

09:40.164 --> 09:44.376
The Stalorne blades,
just as you requested.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.175
EBOR: They're blunt.

09:51.258 --> 09:55.179
That is only how they appear.

09:57.514 --> 09:59.183
(BOTH LAUGHING)

09:59.266 --> 10:01.143
Why should you want such a weapon?

10:02.561 --> 10:05.355
That's none of your business, old man.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.027
You have the crystals?

10:10.694 --> 10:12.029
Money first.

10:30.672 --> 10:31.924
Not yet.

10:36.053 --> 10:42.392

of whoever's blood they touch.

11:04.289 --> 11:05.541
Thank you.

11:06.250 --> 11:07.584
(CHUCKLING) Thank you.

11:22.599 --> 11:23.684
Now what?

11:23.767 --> 11:29.857
Now, Ebor, we can take our revenge on
Prince Arthur of Camelot.

11:29.940 --> 11:31.650

12:23.535 --> 12:25.537
| believe this belongs to you.

12:25.996 --> 12:28.373
| don't think so. It's not my color.

12:28.457 --> 12:31.001
Ah, let us see.

12:35.631 --> 12:37.758
| bet you've got a whole bunch of those
to hand out.

12:37.841 --> 12:39.927
No. Yours is the only one.

12:40.010 --> 12:41.094
(CHUCKLES)

12:41.178 --> 12:42.721
I'm Gwaine.

12:45.182 --> 12:46.975
You haven't told me your name.

12:47.351 --> 12:49.394
You look like a princess to me.

12:49.478 --> 12:53.607
So it's probably something
like Sophia or... Or Esmeralda.

12:53.690 --> 12:57.194
That's it. Princess Esmeralda.

12:57.319 --> 12:59.279
Stop it. People are staring.

12:59.363 --> 13:00.822
Not until you tell me your name.

13:00.906 --> 13:02.407
It's Gwen.

13:02.532 --> 13:05.577
There. That wasn't so hard now, was it?

13:06.745 --> 13:10.457
Let me carry that. A princess shouldn't
have to lump her washing around.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.501
Unfortunately I'm not a princess.

13:12.584 --> 13:15.587
Ah, but you see, you are to me.

13:19.716 --> 13:22.302
-This isn't working, is it?
-No, not really.

13:22.386 --> 13:25.347
But I like that you tried
and that you know when to give up.

13:27.724 --> 13:30.727
You'd better have this, in case someone
else takes your fancy.

13:30.811 --> 13:32.104
I've only eyes for you.

13:32.187 --> 13:33.397
I'm sure.

13:48.537 --> 13:50.872
How much further would you say it is
to Camelot?

13:50.956 --> 13:54.001
Half a day's ride.
The journey is almost over.

13:54.084 --> 13:55.669
It is for you.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.462

14:45.135 --> 14:46.470
You look good, Dagr.

14:46.553 --> 14:47.971
Sir Oswald.

14:48.263 --> 14:49.306
Sorry, Sire.

14:49.931 --> 14:51.308
That's all right.

14:55.645 --> 14:56.938
Your turn.

14:58.815 --> 15:00.984
Then we can take our rightful
place in the melee.

15:16.750 --> 15:17.834
Sir Oswald!

15:21.213 --> 15:22.964
Didn't think you'd be brave
enough to show up.

your backside?

This is my servant Merlin.

16:05.132 --> 16:07.384
That's very kind of you.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.052
(PANTING)

16:09.136 --> 16:10.512
But you can't leave it there.

16:10.595 --> 16:13.473
-I can't?
-It's in the way.

16:13.557 --> 16:15.308
Okay, where do you want it?

16:17.060 --> 16:18.895
Over there, by the bed.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.565
(SIGHING)

16:30.782 --> 16:33.910
Oh, no. The other side.

16:45.255 --> 16:47.299
It's going to get in my way there.

16:49.092 --> 16:50.427
Where do you want it?

16:50.510 --> 16:52.179
On top of the wardrobe.

16:52.262 --> 16:53.847
On top?

16:53.930 --> 16:57.934
You're absolutely right, Oswald.
That's exactly where it should be.

17:20.080 --> 17:21.875

It's very hard to work out whether you
are eating or inhaling that soup.

17:29.758 --> 17:33.303
| haven't had anything all day.
Sir Oswald had me at his beck and call.

17:34.638 --> 17:35.889
How is he?

17:35.972 --> 17:38.475
Awful. He treats me like dirt.

17:38.558 --> 17:41.186
That doesn't sound like
the young man I knew.

17:41.269 --> 17:44.397
He always struck me as a
rather kind and thoughtful soul.

17:44.481 --> 17:45.941
He must have changed.

17:46.024 --> 17:50.487
You must remember that not all masters
are as good to their servants as Arthur.

17:56.993 --> 17:58.370
Thank you, Merlin.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.122
Sorry.

18:01.873 --> 18:03.041
(DOOR OPENING)

18:05.043 --> 18:07.170
Merlin, I think you need to
come with me.

18:16.763 --> 18:17.847
You drank all this?

18:17.931 --> 18:20.267
With some help from my new friends!

18:22.185 --> 18:24.312
He says that he hasn't got any money.

18:24.396 --> 18:27.065
So it looks like you'll have to pay.

18:27.148 --> 18:28.358
But... I can't afford this.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.485
You better find someone who can.

18:31.403 --> 18:33.405
(LAUGHS DRUNKENLY)

18:41.997 --> 18:43.790
You're the best friend I've ever had.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.208
You seem to have quite a few.

18:45.292 --> 18:47.502
(BOTH LAUGH)

18:47.585 --> 18:51.298
Oh, I'd love to see Arthur's face
when he gets that bill.

18:51.381 --> 18:52.799
Right.

18:52.882 --> 18:54.050
What is it with you and nobles?

18:54.175 --> 18:55.593
Oh, nothing.

18:55.677 --> 18:58.888
My father was a knight in
Caerleon's army.

18:58.972 --> 19:02.225
He died in battle,
leaving my mother penniless.

19:03.601 --> 19:07.022
And when she went to the King for help,
he turned her away.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.276
You didn't know him?

19:11.401 --> 19:13.486
Just some stories I've been told.

19:13.570 --> 19:15.196
Yeah, I know how that feels.

before he died.

19:22.871 --> 19:24.247
Why?

19:24.789 --> 19:26.207
He was banished.

19:27.042 --> 19:28.752
What had he done?

19:29.586 --> 19:30.754
Nothing.

19:34.299 --> 19:35.467
He served the King.

19:35.550 --> 19:37.093
But the King turned against him?

19:39.471 --> 19:41.264
That doesn't surprise me.

19:41.348 --> 19:42.849
-Arthur's not like that.
-(SCOFFS)

19:42.932 --> 19:46.186

are worth dying for, huh?

19:47.896 --> 19:50.273
(LAUGHING)

19:57.614 --> 19:59.657
Sorry. I know, I'm late.

19:59.908 --> 20:01.326
Not at all.

20:03.953 --> 20:04.996
Good.

20:05.622 --> 20:07.874
Sure you're all right? You're not sick,

20:07.957 --> 20:10.085

20:10.168 --> 20:11.461
No, why?

“three flagons of wine,

20:23.014 --> 20:25.058

20:25.141 --> 20:26.226
That was Gwaine.

20:26.309 --> 20:28.353
He went to the tavern and, uh...

20:29.396 --> 20:30.688
He couldn't pay for it.

20:30.772 --> 20:32.690
So you said I would.

20:32.774 --> 20:33.983
Mmm.

20:34.067 --> 20:36.236
You know, if I hadn't, that innkeeper,

20:36.319 --> 20:37.946
he would've strung us both up.

20:38.029 --> 20:39.489

20:40.490 --> 20:42.117
You said he should be given
anything he needs.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.660

20:43.743 --> 20:44.786

20:46.121 --> 20:47.163

20:49.749 --> 20:52.502
You most certainly will.

20:52.585 --> 20:55.547
Arthur is a thoroughbred
little braggart.

20:55.630 --> 20:57.048
Why?

20:57.132 --> 20:58.842
For making us do this.

21:00.176 --> 21:02.011
| think it's fair.

21:03.304 --> 21:04.848
For the entire army?

21:08.476 --> 21:11.229
If you admitted your father was
a knight, you wouldn't have to.

21:11.312 --> 21:15.191
Maybe. But I'm not making the same
mistakes that he did.

21:15.316 --> 21:19.404
Anyway, my father
always treated his servants well.

21:21.656 --> 21:23.241
You didn't know him.

21:23.324 --> 21:24.951
Well, I like to think that he did.

21:28.204 --> 21:29.706
What about yours?

21:30.582 --> 21:32.876
No, he didn't have any servants.
He didn't have...

21:34.711 --> 21:36.504
Well, anyone.

21:37.297 --> 21:38.590
When did he die?

21:40.467 --> 21:43.344
About a year ago.
| just wish that I had the chance to

21:44.220 --> 21:45.805
know him better.

21:48.892 --> 21:50.727
So much he could've taught me.

21:52.687 --> 21:54.063
But you did get to meet him.

21:56.274 --> 21:57.817
Yeah.

21:58.776 --> 22:02.071
If there's one thing that
| learned from my father's life

22:02.155 --> 22:05.033
is that titles don't mean anything.

22:05.116 --> 22:07.660
It's what's inside that counts.

22:07.744 --> 22:08.745

You look like you need
a bit of practice.

22:51.204 --> 22:52.747
Yes, I am, |I...

To the eye the sword appeared blunt,
but when I touched it...

You were lucky.
I've seen those blades in action.

The prisoner is responsible for their
deaths. I want him executed immediately.

40:12.369 --> 40:15.497
You might want to wait before
you pass judgment.

40:15.664 --> 40:17.082
| fear that...

40:18.667 --> 40:22.421
Sir Ethan and Sir Oswald

40:23.380 --> 40:25.048
are not all that they seem.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.268
Sorcery.

40:43.025 --> 40:45.027
And once again I owe Gwaine my life.

40:59.041 --> 41:01.668
The King is prepared to overlook the
fact that you fought in the melee.

41:01.752 --> 41:03.462
(GASPS) That's fantastic!

41:03.545 --> 41:05.672
-Thank you, Arthur.
-But...

41:07.341 --> 41:08.717
He's a stubborn man.

41:08.800 --> 41:12.054
He will not rescind his judgment.
You must leave Camelot.

41:12.929 --> 41:15.057
Oh, you've got to speak to him, Arthur,
make him change his mind.

41:15.140 --> 41:16.350
Merlin.

41:17.309 --> 41:20.354
I'm sorry, Gwaine. My father's wrong.

41:20.437 --> 41:22.064
-If it were up to me...
- I know.

41:22.189 --> 41:24.191
You don't need to explain yourself.

41:25.067 --> 41:26.652
You have until sunset.

41:28.737 --> 41:30.238
Where will you go?

41:30.322 --> 41:32.157
| was thinking Mercia.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.867
-It's dangerous.
-Yeah.

41:33.950 --> 41:36.036
And you get a lot more ale
for your money.

41:36.119 --> 41:37.496
I'm joking.

41:37.579 --> 41:39.414
Why don't you tell the King
who you really are?

41:39.498 --> 41:41.541
He'll grant you a pardon,
you can stay in Camelot.

41:41.625 --> 41:44.211
| could never serve under a
man like Uther.

41:44.294 --> 41:45.837
Yet you helped Arthur.

41:45.921 --> 41:48.090
-He stood up for me.
- I knew he would.

41:48.965 --> 41:50.342
That showed he is, indeed, a noble man.

41:50.425 --> 41:52.094
Then why don't you stay?

41:53.053 --> 41:55.847
You could be a knight. Like your father.

41:58.433 --> 42:01.478
You and Arthur,
you fought well together.

42:06.358 --> 42:08.110
Then maybe one day we will again.

42:26.461 --> 42:29.131
ARTHUR: It's a shame.
He would've been a great knight.

42:30.507 --> 42:32.217
Maybe one day he still will.

42:33.635 --> 42:35.637
The rules won't allow it.

42:35.721 --> 42:37.681
Knights are noblemen.

42:38.557 --> 42:40.392
Always have been, always will be.

42:40.475 --> 42:42.477
It's a tradition that...

42:49.151 --> 42:50.736
They seem very friendly!

42:50.819 --> 42:52.654
Why should you care?

42:55.490 --> 42:56.742
| don't.

42:56.825 --> 42:58.285
(GWEN LAUGHING)

42:59.786 --> 43:00.996
She could do better than that!

43:01.079 --> 43:03.749
What? She should be setting
her sights higher?

43:05.375 --> 43:10.088
Oh, but I forget! She can't.
A girl of Gwen's standing, no.

43:10.172 --> 43:13.008
She could never consort with a nobleman.
That's the rules.

43:13.925 --> 43:16.261
-Merlin.
-Shut up.

43:17.179 --> 43:18.555
You guessed it.

43:34.237 --> 43:35.864
Merlin.

43:39.117 --> 43:40.952
This is the Crystal Cave.

43:41.036 --> 43:43.205
Use what you see for good.

43:43.330 --> 43:44.372
No!

43:44.456 --> 43:46.291
| can't get these visions
out of my head.

43:46.374 --> 43:48.293
The events I saw are imminent.

43:48.376 --> 43:50.545
Morgana, is going to kill Uther.

43:55.217 --> 43:56.968
We have to stop her.

43:59.721 --> 44:00.722
(SCREAMS)
