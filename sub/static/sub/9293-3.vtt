00:13.200 --> 00:15.111
(man) America has been victimised again.

00:15.200 --> 00:19.557
Last night's terrorist attack in San Antonio
was the latest in this series of bombings

00:19.640 --> 00:22.029
that began 11 weeks ago
in ten different cities.

00:27.240 --> 00:31.153
Retrieve the package.
Call me when you have it.

00:40.320 --> 00:42.834
- What happened?
- You shouldn't have come here, Scott.

00:42.920 --> 00:46.469
I don't wanna hurt you,
but I will unless you do exactly what I say.

00:47.240 --> 00:51.279
I'm Mr Al-Rezani's attorney.
There are no terrorists here.

00:51.360 --> 00:53.999
Yes, it's Sandra Palmer.
I'd like to speak with my brother.

00:54.080 --> 00:58.870
The FBI was just here, and they
wanted access to the IAA's personnel records.

00:58.960 --> 01:01.474
I have to do whatever I can
to stop these attacks.

01:01.560 --> 01:06.156
That includes giving law enforcement
the authority to follow up every single lead.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.276
- I can't find the files.
- They've been erased.

01:08.360 --> 01:11.352
Don't try to recall them.
I used the shredding program.

01:11.440 --> 01:13.874
- Sandra, what are you doing?
- You're under arrest.

01:13.960 --> 01:17.236
- Take Mr Al-Rezani into custody.
- Wait. He has nothing to do with this.

01:18.720 --> 01:22.679
- Don't move. Where is Assad?
- Put down your weapon.

01:22.760 --> 01:27.550
I came alone. Fayed set you up. He provided
CTU with the coordinates to this house.

01:28.880 --> 01:29.915
Move! Move!

01:32.960 --> 01:37.158
Most of my people and the governments
that support us agreed to a cease-fire.

01:37.240 --> 01:40.550
- Fayed wants to sabotage it?
- Yes. But finding Fayed is the key.

01:40.960 --> 01:43.554
- These are Fayed's men.
- They're going in the subway.

01:43.640 --> 01:45.073
They can't get on that train.

01:45.160 --> 01:48.835
(Assad) Only the bomber is getting on
the train. The other man is the handler.

01:48.920 --> 01:52.071
(Jack) You follow the handler.
I'm going after the bomber.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.952
(screaming)

02:12.520 --> 02:13.919
(phone rings)

02:14.000 --> 02:16.230
- We're heading in your direction.
- I'll find you.

02:16.320 --> 02:19.471
Stay with the handler.
He's our only connection to Fayed.

02:34.760 --> 02:39.470
- You still have Fayed's man in sight?
- He's in a grey sedan, about six cars ahead.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.996
(phone rings)

02:51.240 --> 02:53.231
- Yes?
- (Fayed) Are you on schedule?

02:53.320 --> 02:56.198
There was traffic by Union Station.
I'm on the road now.

02:56.280 --> 03:00.910
There has been a change. I need you to stop
in Newhall before you come back here.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.356
The Americans will be feeling helpless.
I'm making the call.

03:06.040 --> 03:09.157
(Buchanan) The casualty estimate
in St Louis has risen to 112.

03:09.240 --> 03:13.313
The mall attack in Baltimore is even worse.
Over 200 dead,

03:14.360 --> 03:16.669
many of them children.

03:16.760 --> 03:20.992
My God. What about
the bomb in Los Angeles?

03:21.080 --> 03:24.231
Jack Bauer averted the attack
at Union Station.

03:24.320 --> 03:28.108
Surveillance from Metro Transit
also confirmed he's working with Assad.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.838
Have you made contact?

03:29.920 --> 03:33.469
Jack's been dark since he called
to warn us about Fayed and we didn't listen.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.316
I didn't listen.

03:38.040 --> 03:40.918
Fayed is demanding
to speak with the president.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.913
Mr President, we're receiving a call
on a scrambled channel from Fayed, sir.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.515
- He's demanding to speak with you.
- Put him on.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.639
This is President Palmer.

03:54.720 --> 03:59.794
Mr President, we've proven
we can strike at you any time, anywhere.

03:59.880 --> 04:04.590
But I am prepared to offer you a cease-fire,
if you meet my demands.

04:04.680 --> 04:06.113
Your demands?

04:06.880 --> 04:11.715
We met your demands when you deceived us
about Assad being behind these attacks.

04:11.800 --> 04:14.792
Now you expect me to accept
your assurances of a cease-fire?

04:14.880 --> 04:19.031
I expect you will take action that promises
to avoid the loss of more American lives.

04:20.880 --> 04:22.916
What do you want?

04:23.000 --> 04:26.197
You are holding 110
so-called enemy combatants

04:26.280 --> 04:31.195
at your Palmdale military facility
in violation of international law.

04:31.280 --> 04:33.999
You must have all these freedom fighters

04:34.080 --> 04:38.870
on a nonmilitary aircraft in the air
by the end of the hour.

04:38.960 --> 04:43.192
The pilot will be told the destination
once the plane is outside your airspace.

04:43.280 --> 04:45.714
If I agree, there is not enough time...

04:45.800 --> 04:49.793
You'll find a way. If you don't
release the prisoners by the deadline,

04:49.880 --> 04:54.078
the consequences will be
immediate and devastating.

04:54.160 --> 04:57.152
I will only make this offer once,
Mr President.

04:57.760 --> 05:02.629
For your country's sake, I hope you accept it.

05:05.520 --> 05:09.399
Is that what these attacks have been about?
Releasing the prisoners?

05:09.480 --> 05:14.759
Sir, I feel it's wishful thinking
to assume this is Fayed's endgame.

05:14.840 --> 05:18.549
Contact Palmdale. Find out what
would be involved in making this happen.

05:18.640 --> 05:19.470
Yes, sir.

05:19.560 --> 05:24.873
Mr President, you cannot seriously consider
giving in to this man's demands.

05:24.960 --> 05:27.997
I mean, you said yourself,
Fayed cannot be trusted.

05:28.080 --> 05:33.279
No, he can't. I do not believe he has
any intention of stopping these attacks.

05:33.360 --> 05:36.955
Not permanently. But doing this
buys us more time to find Fayed.

05:37.040 --> 05:40.271
At the very least it gives the country
a respite from the bombings.

05:40.360 --> 05:43.955
Sir, you'd be releasing
110 extremely dangerous terrorists.

05:44.040 --> 05:46.190
Karen, I am very well aware of that.

05:47.200 --> 05:50.431
But unless we find Fayed, I may be forced to.

06:02.240 --> 06:04.595
- Oh, no. We got a problem.
- What?

06:04.680 --> 06:09.037
He's heading north. The farther he gets,
the less traffic we'll have to hide in.

06:09.120 --> 06:11.839
It'll be hard to track him to Fayed
without him seeing us.

06:11.920 --> 06:16.152
- What else can we do?
- Call CTU. They'll give us satellite coverage.

06:16.240 --> 06:18.754
No CTU. They killed my men.
They tried to kill me.

06:18.840 --> 06:21.229
Fayed made them believe
you were behind the bombings.

06:21.320 --> 06:23.709
I will not work with my enemies.

06:23.800 --> 06:29.272
You are working with one now. You might
hate this country, you might hate its values.

06:29.360 --> 06:34.036
If you're serious about disarming, bringing
your organisation and others to the table,

06:34.120 --> 06:36.236
then you know you have to compromise.

06:36.320 --> 06:41.792
- That is your political reality.
- What's to say they won't put me in prison?

06:41.880 --> 06:46.192
I can't tell you they won't, but right now
that is our only lead to Fayed.

06:50.360 --> 06:53.750
- Make the call.
- Thank you.

06:54.400 --> 06:57.517
- Morris, I need you to load this.
- What is it?

06:57.600 --> 07:01.434
Fayed is asking the president
to release all the prisoners from Palmdale.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.590
We need to vet each one in case he does.

07:03.680 --> 07:09.073
He won't. They are serious high-grade
terror suspects. No one's letting them go.

07:09.160 --> 07:12.391
Excuse me. Are you refusing to do this?

07:12.480 --> 07:17.156
Give this to the girls in archives. I'm working
up Fayed threads. It's more important.

07:17.240 --> 07:20.755
I don't care what you think is important.
It's not your place to tell me.

07:20.840 --> 07:23.718
Just calm down.
I'm trying to help you do yourjob.

07:23.800 --> 07:28.396
You have to evaluate directives. Don't waste
the time of your most important analysts.

07:28.480 --> 07:29.469
- I'm...
- Morris.

07:29.560 --> 07:31.755
What? What?

07:31.840 --> 07:33.990
Put filters on each of these files.

07:34.080 --> 07:38.551
If I don't have results on my screen
in 20 minutes, you are out of here.

07:38.640 --> 07:41.154
- Grow up.
- (phone rings)

07:41.240 --> 07:44.118
- O'Brian.
- Chloe, this is Jack.

07:44.200 --> 07:48.876
- I didn't think I'd ever hear your voice again.
- I need to speak to Buchanan.

07:48.960 --> 07:50.791
Hold on.

07:51.360 --> 07:52.349
Buchanan.

07:52.440 --> 07:55.989
- (Chloe) It's Jack on line one.
- Jack, where are you?

07:56.080 --> 07:58.753
With Assad,
tracking a suspect in the train bombing.

07:58.840 --> 08:01.957
We know you're working with Assad.
Are you sure you can trust him?

08:02.040 --> 08:03.109
I think so.

08:04.360 --> 08:07.511
- What do you need?
- Suspect's on Florence, crossing Ormond.

08:07.600 --> 08:10.831
We believe he'll lead us to Fayed.
We need satellite support.

08:10.920 --> 08:13.559
Logging on to the NSA server now.

08:13.640 --> 08:18.270
Fayed contacted the president and demanded
he release the prisoners at Palmdale.

08:18.360 --> 08:20.032
What's the president's position?

08:20.120 --> 08:23.078
If we don't find Fayed by 9am,
he'll go through with it.

08:23.160 --> 08:27.790
It'll take me ten minutes to get satellite
coverage. I had to use the subserver.

08:27.880 --> 08:31.429
That's too long. He's entering Route 7.
If we try to follow, he'll see us.

08:31.520 --> 08:33.476
Chloe, can you speed up access?

08:33.559 --> 08:36.028
Sat queue's overloaded.
The country is on high alert.

08:36.120 --> 08:41.876
- We'll use Caltrans cameras to track him.
- There isn't a traffic cam on Route 7. I looked.

08:41.960 --> 08:45.236
Figure out another way to track him
till the satellite's up.

08:45.320 --> 08:48.278
- Where's your nearest TAC team?
- 12 miles away.

08:48.360 --> 08:51.272
Send 'em in my direction.
I'll get back to you.

08:53.080 --> 08:57.596
- Do you think this man will recognise you?
- No. What do you have in mind?

08:58.600 --> 09:00.636
All right, thanks. Manning on comm.

09:00.720 --> 09:04.156
I spoke to Jack. He's surveilling
one of Fayed's men and needs backup.

09:04.240 --> 09:08.074
- Where is he?
- Florence Boulevard, near Route 7.

09:08.160 --> 09:11.550
He's running this operation with Assad.

09:11.640 --> 09:15.030
Did I hear that correctly?
We're working with Assad?

09:15.120 --> 09:17.315
Rendezvous with them and lend support.

09:17.400 --> 09:22.474
All warrants on Assad are rescinded
for the time being, understood?

09:22.560 --> 09:24.118
Curtis?

09:24.800 --> 09:26.916
We're on our way.

09:30.680 --> 09:32.671
Don't get up.

09:42.440 --> 09:44.670
(horn)

10:34.880 --> 10:38.270
Hey! What's wrong with you?
I know you saw me coming!

10:38.360 --> 10:41.557
- It was my right of way!
- You telling me I don't know how to drive?

10:41.640 --> 10:44.677
- I'm talking to you!
- You all right? I saw the whole thing.

10:44.760 --> 10:48.469
- This has got nothing to do with you!
- I'm a witness. You drove into him.

10:48.560 --> 10:52.314
What is it with you people?
You're gonna stick up for him?

10:52.400 --> 10:55.437
Fine, I'll wait here until the police arrive.

10:56.400 --> 10:59.358
Screw both of you. Screw you!

10:59.440 --> 11:01.670
Where are you going? Hey! Hey!

11:01.760 --> 11:04.320
This is your fault!

11:04.400 --> 11:06.550
I saw his license for the police.

11:06.640 --> 11:09.632
I can't wait for the police.
I can't drive this.

11:09.720 --> 11:12.359
I need to be somewhere.
I'll deal with this later.

11:12.440 --> 11:14.431
Where are you going?

11:14.520 --> 11:20.629
- Newhall. I was getting on Route 7.
- So was I. I'll drop you there. Come. Come.

11:20.720 --> 11:22.392
Thank you.

11:50.640 --> 11:53.154
(phone rings)

11:55.320 --> 12:00.519
I hope you won't let that bastard get away
with this. You must file a police report.

12:00.600 --> 12:02.591
I know.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.756
Come on.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.719
- (woman) CTU.
- I need to speak with Bill Buchanan.

12:11.800 --> 12:13.074
Hold, please.

12:13.160 --> 12:14.479
(phone rings)

12:15.440 --> 12:18.432
- Buchanan.
- Fayed's man is now in a car with Assad.

12:18.520 --> 12:21.876
- What happened?
- Suspect was in a traffic incident. Listen.

12:21.960 --> 12:24.269
Assad left his phone open so we can monitor.

12:24.360 --> 12:27.989
I'll be following roughly two miles behind
in a white Jeep Cherokee.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.469
Assad will let us know where he's going.

12:30.560 --> 12:34.109
- I'm ready to transfer you into the call.
- Go ahead, Jack.

12:35.680 --> 12:40.231
Bill, they can't hear us on our side.
You should be on the call now.

12:44.440 --> 12:47.432
I don't know Newhall very well.
I need you to guide me.

12:47.520 --> 12:48.794
(man) I will.

12:48.880 --> 12:52.793
Nadia, do an all-agency data pull on Newhall.
Set up parameters for a sort.

12:52.880 --> 12:55.872
When we get satellite,
make sure we have coverage of that area.

12:55.960 --> 13:00.795
Let Curtis know he's to intercept Jack
on Route 7 on the way to Newhall.

13:03.720 --> 13:05.915
- Fayed.
- What is it?

13:06.000 --> 13:09.959
Our scout reports increased activity
around the Palmdale military prison.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.759
The transport buses are starting to arrive.

13:12.840 --> 13:18.198
Good. By the time our brothers are on the
aircraft, it will be too late for the Americans

13:18.280 --> 13:22.478
- to realise what's happened.
- We still don't have the component.

13:23.440 --> 13:26.830
We will. Ahmed should be
on his way to pick it up now.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.278
- Scott, is that you?
- Yeah.

13:40.360 --> 13:43.033
Honey, we were beginning to get worried.

13:43.120 --> 13:46.874
- My God, Ahmed, what happened?
- Mom, he has a gun.

13:48.240 --> 13:51.630
- What's going on? What is this?
- Where's Ray?

13:54.160 --> 13:57.470
Just put the gun down
and tell me what's happening.

13:57.560 --> 13:59.835
Call him.

13:59.920 --> 14:01.194
Ray!

14:02.800 --> 14:05.155
Yeah?

14:06.160 --> 14:08.037
- What the hell?
- I don't wanna hurt you,

14:08.120 --> 14:13.194
but I will unless you do exactly what I say.
You're a nurse, right? You have bandages?

14:13.280 --> 14:15.999
- Yeah.
- Go get them. Now!

14:20.000 --> 14:23.515
You two, on the couch, now. Come on.

14:27.880 --> 14:31.759
Sit down now.

14:37.200 --> 14:40.636
I need you to patch this leg,
stop the bleeding.

14:40.720 --> 14:43.792
My God, Stan was right.
You are a terrorist.

14:43.880 --> 14:47.031
- Stan's dead. He killed him.
- What?

14:47.120 --> 14:49.918
- I can't stop this bleeding.
- Don't tell me that!

14:50.000 --> 14:54.073
The wound's too deep. You have muscle
tissue damage. You need to see a doctor.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.479
Just bandage it!

15:00.320 --> 15:04.199
There's a package in there. I'm supposed to
take it to a man who has an item for me.

15:04.280 --> 15:07.113
- Press.
- Ah!

15:07.760 --> 15:10.911
Obviously I can't do that now,
so you're gonna have to.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.673
I'm not leaving you alone with my family.

15:13.760 --> 15:17.196
Your family will be safe
when you do what I say.

15:17.280 --> 15:22.877
When you pick up the item, you'll call me
and I'll give you further instructions.

15:31.960 --> 15:35.396
- What's in this package?
- None of your concern. Just make the drop.

15:35.480 --> 15:37.789
Grab that phone and come here.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.869
Come here, come here.
Understand this.

15:41.960 --> 15:47.478
If I see anyone - the police, FBI, anybody
outside this house, or if you take too long -

15:47.560 --> 15:49.994
your wife and son are dead.

15:51.680 --> 15:54.274
Do you understand me? Look at me!

15:54.360 --> 15:56.271
I understand.

15:58.000 --> 15:58.989
Where am I going?

15:59.080 --> 16:04.712
There's an address on the front pocket
of that backpack. It's a man named Marcus.

16:16.640 --> 16:17.675
Go.

16:46.480 --> 16:48.710
(phone rings)

16:48.800 --> 16:51.553
- How far away are you?
- Less than five minutes.

16:51.640 --> 16:55.599
Get there fast. Assad and Fayed's man
are on open road, five miles ahead.

16:55.680 --> 16:56.669
Got it.

16:56.760 --> 16:58.751
- Oh, darling?
- What?

16:58.840 --> 17:01.877
- Since when do you take Milo's side?
- You're doing it again.

17:01.960 --> 17:04.713
- What?
- Pick on your bosses when you're stressed.

17:04.800 --> 17:07.951
- Milo's not my boss, heaven forbid.
- He might as well be.

17:08.040 --> 17:10.508
He could bounce you.
I think you want it sometimes.

17:10.599 --> 17:12.318
And why would I want that?

17:12.400 --> 17:15.278
I don't know.
It's your character flaw, not mine.

17:19.160 --> 17:24.029
The files you wanted are all unlocked.
They'll be on your screen in a minute.

17:24.119 --> 17:26.429
Good.

17:36.800 --> 17:39.314
Mr President.

17:39.400 --> 17:43.313
I just got off the phone with CTU.
They've reconnected with Jack Bauer.

17:43.400 --> 17:47.109
- Where is he?
- He's following one of Fayed's operatives.

17:47.200 --> 17:51.637
CTU is coordinating support for Jack. They
believe this man will lead them to Fayed.

17:51.720 --> 17:53.870
Did CTU offer a time frame for locating him?

17:53.960 --> 17:57.396
No, sir. At this point,
any estimates are premature.

17:57.480 --> 18:00.711
- Have you spoken with the Palmdale facility?
- And the airfield.

18:00.800 --> 18:04.395
If we wanna have the prisoners in the air
before the end of the hour,

18:04.480 --> 18:09.110
we have to have them on buses
and on the road within the next ten minutes.

18:09.200 --> 18:12.510
If you still want to proceed with that option.

18:14.120 --> 18:17.749
I know you disapprove of my decision,
but unless Jack and CTU

18:17.840 --> 18:22.072
call to say they have Fayed,
there is no other option here.

18:25.840 --> 18:29.674
- Tell them to load the buses.
- Yes, Mr President.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.950
(Assad) Sand Canyon Road.

18:42.320 --> 18:43.719
What?

18:43.800 --> 18:48.794
I was just remembering. I had a friend
who lived on Sand Canyon Road.

18:54.840 --> 18:58.037
We can take the service route from here.

19:11.240 --> 19:14.915
They're two miles ahead.
We can monitor with this cellphone.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.309
CTU wants you on comm.

19:17.400 --> 19:20.358
- You copy?
- Ten-four.

19:27.120 --> 19:29.236
- CTU, this is Manning.
- (Bill) Go ahead.

19:29.320 --> 19:31.754
I'm with Jack.
Do we have satellite access yet?

19:31.840 --> 19:35.196
- It's coming up. Is Jack on the line?
- I'm here, Bill.

19:35.280 --> 19:39.353
We're redirecting the NSA satellite to the
area around Sand Canyon Road exit marker.

19:39.440 --> 19:42.432
When we have a fix on Assad's vehicle,
we'll upload it to your GPS.

19:42.520 --> 19:43.555
Copy that.

19:48.480 --> 19:51.119
It's good to see you, Jack.

19:53.320 --> 19:57.029
I'm sorry for what you were put through.

19:57.120 --> 19:59.759
- But I'm glad you're back.
- Thanks.

20:00.440 --> 20:05.036
Now you have to work with Assad.
Doesn't that bother you?

20:09.160 --> 20:13.995
The man's a terrorist, responsible for taking
hundreds, maybe thousands of innocent lives

20:14.080 --> 20:18.517
over the past 20 years.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

20:20.000 --> 20:23.788
I don't know what means
anything any more, Curtis.

20:24.960 --> 20:29.670
I spent my whole life defending
this country against people like Assad.

20:29.760 --> 20:33.469
And now he's trying to disarm his people,
renounce terrorism.

20:33.560 --> 20:37.030
- The playing field has changed.
- That doesn't change Assad's past.

20:37.120 --> 20:41.557
We have to make sure that
he pays for the crimes that he's committed.

20:41.640 --> 20:46.794
If he's our only chance at a peaceful
resolution to this, that might not happen.

20:46.880 --> 20:49.155
Anyway, it's not our call to make.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.788
We'll see.

20:52.880 --> 20:56.190
What is that supposed to mean?

20:56.280 --> 20:57.315
Nothing.

20:58.760 --> 21:00.637
Good.

21:05.840 --> 21:08.798
This isn't working.

21:08.880 --> 21:13.192
There's still too much pain.
I need something stronger.

21:13.280 --> 21:17.114
Uh, there are some
prescription painkillers in the kitchen.

21:17.200 --> 21:19.589
Get them, and some water.

21:19.680 --> 21:22.638
Make sure I can see you.

21:24.680 --> 21:27.433
They're in the cabinet over the TV.

22:01.280 --> 22:03.271
Give it to me.

22:18.720 --> 22:21.314
Sit down.

22:25.640 --> 22:28.200
Sit down!

22:29.240 --> 22:30.559
Sit down, sweetie.

22:57.880 --> 22:59.996
Form an orderly line.

23:00.080 --> 23:02.435
Head count will be taken.

23:02.520 --> 23:06.035
Then, and only then,
you'll be loaded onto those buses.

23:06.120 --> 23:11.513
Understand, any problems you cause
will only delay this process.

23:12.200 --> 23:13.235
Get in line.

23:36.440 --> 23:38.795
I'll tell him. Right.

23:38.880 --> 23:43.032
Uh, that was the FBI.
Your sister, she's been arrested.

23:43.120 --> 23:46.078
- What? When?
- Less than an hour ago.

23:46.160 --> 23:49.630
FBI agents were sent to the offices
of the Islamic-American Alliance

23:49.720 --> 23:55.238
to serve a warrant for their personnel files.
Sandra deleted them in front of the agents.

23:55.320 --> 24:00.952
- They had no choice but to arrest her.
- Dammit. Where has she been taken, Tom?

24:01.040 --> 24:04.999
She's being detained.
One of our provisional facilities.

24:08.240 --> 24:09.229
(woman) Yes, sir.

24:09.320 --> 24:11.311
(yelling, chanting)

24:29.320 --> 24:31.515
Walid, I'm so sorry I got you into this.

24:31.600 --> 24:35.593
I deleted those files. It wasn't right
for them to arrest you for my actions.

24:35.680 --> 24:39.673
Don't apologise. You were protecting
the rights of innocent Americans.

24:39.760 --> 24:44.436
That's what this country stands for,
even if the government's forgotten.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.629
Back away. Move back.
Come on. That's it.

24:51.040 --> 24:53.235
You take him.

24:53.320 --> 24:56.118
Where are you taking him? Walid?

24:56.200 --> 24:57.872
I'll be all right.

24:57.960 --> 25:00.838
Over here, Ms Palmer.

25:00.920 --> 25:02.751
Take off her cuffs.

25:07.360 --> 25:09.669
For you.

25:10.960 --> 25:12.313
I'll be right here.

25:12.400 --> 25:15.551
- Hello?
- (woman) Please hold for the president.

25:17.200 --> 25:21.591
- What were you thinking deleting those files?
- I was standing up to an unlawful seizure.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.910
You making a point
is the last thing I need today.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.470
I ordered your release.
Agents have instructions to take you home.

25:27.560 --> 25:30.597
I don't wanna be released.
I wanna fight this,

25:30.680 --> 25:34.559
bring attention to the liberties
your administration allowed to be violated.

25:34.640 --> 25:36.995
- Do you have any idea what's going on?
- Of course.

25:37.080 --> 25:40.993
Innocent people are dying all over
the country. You make a civil rights case now.

25:41.080 --> 25:45.392
Somebody has to. If you're gonna
release anybody, it should be Walid.

25:45.480 --> 25:48.278
He's the head of the organisation
under investigation.

25:48.360 --> 25:52.239
The FBI wants to hold him until they know
what was in those files you deleted.

25:52.320 --> 25:57.155
There is nothing incriminating on those files.
You have my word. Walid is innocent.

25:57.240 --> 25:59.993
Then Walid has nothing
to worry about, Sandra.

26:00.080 --> 26:03.038
Listen, I don't have time for this.

26:03.120 --> 26:06.476
You are released.
Go home. I will call you later.

26:14.040 --> 26:16.759
- I need to speak with Walid.
- That's not going to happen.

26:16.840 --> 26:19.752
I'm his attorney.
You have to give me access to him.

26:19.840 --> 26:22.912
Don't tell me what I have to do.
I'm following orders.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.037
- Walid has rights.
- Limited rights, Ms Palmer.

26:26.120 --> 26:29.192
He's being held under
the revised enemy combatant statute.

26:29.280 --> 26:32.317
Applying this statute
to somebody like him is ridiculous.

26:32.400 --> 26:35.517
Is the law being
completely thrown out of the window?

26:35.600 --> 26:40.754
When you're through with the lectures,
I have orders to drive you home.

26:40.840 --> 26:42.831
Ma'am?

26:47.360 --> 26:51.478
Stay to the left.
Once inside the secure zone, you will disrobe.

26:51.560 --> 26:56.076
After a cavity search,
you'll be given back your clothing.

26:56.720 --> 27:00.713
- Sir, you have to keep moving.
- I don't care. I'm innocent.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.836
I wanna talk to somebody in authority.

27:02.920 --> 27:05.593
- We're not gonna ask you again.
- Don't touch me.

27:06.640 --> 27:08.995
- Let him alone!
- Sir, get back in line.

27:09.080 --> 27:11.548
Not until you let go of that man.

27:13.640 --> 27:15.153
Take your hands off me.

27:17.960 --> 27:19.678
Take him to interrogation.

27:44.440 --> 27:46.954
Do you live around here?

27:47.040 --> 27:48.553
No.

27:48.640 --> 27:50.870
Visiting relatives?

27:50.960 --> 27:53.952
- Why do you ask?
- To make sure you can get back to your car.

27:54.040 --> 27:57.316
- I'll be OK.
- "I'll be OK."

27:57.400 --> 28:02.076
My son, he says this. He has a memory
like a fish. His mother is very worried.

28:03.440 --> 28:07.069
On the next corner, make a right.
Drop me off at the end of the street.

28:07.160 --> 28:10.516
- Did you copy that?
- It's the 6500 block of Alderton.

28:10.600 --> 28:14.434
Bring up the data on all buildings
within a half mile and begin a pre-sort.

28:14.520 --> 28:15.873
Like I'm doing already?

28:15.960 --> 28:17.439
Right over here.

28:37.560 --> 28:42.395
- All right, thanks again for your help.
- Please, it's nothing.

28:49.040 --> 28:53.670
He's crossing 64th Road, heading towards
the commercial district. I'm turning around.

28:53.760 --> 28:57.150
- There he is.
- We've acquired the suspect on satellite.

29:13.640 --> 29:17.553
- Have your men set up a moving perimeter.
- Collier, take your men across 64th.

29:17.640 --> 29:20.438
Set up a moving perimeter behind the target.

29:20.520 --> 29:24.433
- He'll be well trained. Be careful.
- My men know theirjob.

29:25.120 --> 29:28.430
- Do I know you?
- No, but I know you.

29:28.520 --> 29:31.398
He's entering a commercial building
one block south of you.

29:31.480 --> 29:35.632
Copy that. Boorman,
we're gonna take Assad with us.

29:35.720 --> 29:39.269
- Watch him. Search him for weapons.
- Assad is part of this operation.

29:39.360 --> 29:41.794
Not any more.

29:43.680 --> 29:45.955
Wait. Wait.

29:51.320 --> 29:55.199
I'll take care of it
as soon as this is over. I promise.

30:00.960 --> 30:02.188
Thank you.

30:06.280 --> 30:09.317
It's a self-storage facility -
one floor, 200 units.

30:39.480 --> 30:42.199
- Boorman, keep him here.
- Team leader, do you copy?

30:42.280 --> 30:43.713
Go ahead, Collier.

30:43.800 --> 30:47.190
I see two dozen cases of ammunition,
boxes with Czech writing.

30:47.920 --> 30:50.150
This is a dead drop. Fayed's not here.

30:50.240 --> 30:52.071
We only have a few minutes, Jack.

30:52.160 --> 30:55.709
If the suspect won't lead us to Fayed
to stop the prisoner exchange,

30:55.800 --> 30:58.758
we have to move now,
get information through interrogation.

30:58.840 --> 31:02.992
Bill, that's too risky. We have no
guarantee we can make him talk in time.

31:03.080 --> 31:06.117
That's a risk we have to take.
Move your men into position.

31:06.200 --> 31:12.230
Understood. All teams, we're moving in.
Silent approach, non-lethal force.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.950
(clang)

31:46.240 --> 31:48.515
Get out where I can see you!

31:49.640 --> 31:52.473
Step out with your hands up!

31:55.440 --> 31:58.512
Curtis! Everyone back!

32:09.320 --> 32:12.756
Get a fire hose.
Get the fire department and ambulances here!

32:12.840 --> 32:17.277
Bill, it's Jack. Suspect is dead.
He was taking a laptop out of the storage unit.

32:17.360 --> 32:19.476
We'll check the hard drive, but it's damaged.

32:19.560 --> 32:22.233
Understood, Jack.
I need the president.

32:22.600 --> 32:25.717
Yeah, got the feed
of the prisoners at Palmdale.

32:29.360 --> 32:30.839
(intercom beeps)

32:31.920 --> 32:35.390
- Yes?
- (woman) I have Bill Buchanan on the line.

32:35.480 --> 32:37.311
- Put him on.
- Yes, sir.

32:37.400 --> 32:42.872
- We've had a setback to our operation.
- What happened, Bill?

32:42.960 --> 32:47.033
The suspect Jack was following
killed himself rather than be apprehended.

32:47.120 --> 32:50.749
We're examining for evidence.
There's no telling how long that will take

32:50.840 --> 32:52.956
or if it will lead us to Fayed. I'm sorry.

32:53.040 --> 32:56.919
- So am I. Keep me informed.
- Of course.

32:58.080 --> 33:03.552
If you're intent on following through with
this prisoner release, we await your orders.

33:11.320 --> 33:12.673
Load them on the plane.

33:18.200 --> 33:23.718
This is Lennox. The president has made his
decision. Load the prisoners on the plane.

33:26.360 --> 33:29.272
Head count is correct.
All men accounted for on bus three.

33:29.360 --> 33:31.828
I want confirmed head counts
on all other vehicles.

33:31.920 --> 33:34.070
(man) Copy that. Bus one confirmed.

33:35.160 --> 33:37.151
Roger that.

33:37.240 --> 33:41.279
We will proceed single file
in an orderly manner onto the plane.

33:41.360 --> 33:45.797
There will be no mistakes and no disorder.
Is that clear?

33:49.760 --> 33:53.150
Let's get these buses
out of here as soon as we can.

33:55.400 --> 33:57.516
- Let's move.
- Yes, sir.

34:15.159 --> 34:20.757
Fayed, we just heard from the airport.
Our people are being loaded onto the planes.

34:20.840 --> 34:22.831
The president has given in to us.

35:01.400 --> 35:03.356
Hello?

35:07.920 --> 35:08.955
Hello?

35:09.040 --> 35:10.837
(man) Back here.

35:12.560 --> 35:15.358
- You Marcus?
- Who are you?

35:16.360 --> 35:21.559
I'm supposed to give this to you and you're
supposed to give me something in return.

35:39.880 --> 35:41.836
It's not enough.

35:41.920 --> 35:44.115
What do you mean?

35:44.200 --> 35:48.034
The component cost me more than
I thought it would. I need another 50,000.

35:48.120 --> 35:51.954
- But that's all he gave me.
- Well, then go back and get the rest.

35:52.040 --> 35:54.315
I can't do that.

35:56.360 --> 36:00.319
Look, I need whatever it is
you're selling, please.

36:00.400 --> 36:03.915
Just take the money. I am begging you.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.319
Hey.

36:05.400 --> 36:09.598
Until you get more money,
we have nothing more to talk about.

36:15.760 --> 36:18.035
- C-can I use your phone?
- Yeah.

36:25.840 --> 36:28.877
- (phone rings)
- Hello.

36:29.560 --> 36:34.270
- He, um, wants another $50,000.
- Tell him you don't have it.

36:34.360 --> 36:37.989
I did and he said to come back when I get it.

36:38.080 --> 36:43.473
There is no more money. I don't care what
you have to do, but get that item from him.

36:43.560 --> 36:46.120
You understand what happens here
if you don't?

36:49.400 --> 36:50.719
(clears throat) Yeah.

36:50.800 --> 36:52.870
I understand.

36:54.840 --> 36:57.513
- What'd he say?
- He says he'll get the money.

36:57.600 --> 37:02.151
And before I bring it back here, he just
wants to make sure you really do have it.

37:17.040 --> 37:18.792
There it is.

37:27.200 --> 37:28.872
You son of a bitch!

37:36.280 --> 37:37.508
I'll kill you!

37:37.600 --> 37:40.956
Shut up, just take the money!
Just take it.

38:09.000 --> 38:13.551
The hard drive is mostly toast, but I was able
to recover the most recently accessed file.

38:13.640 --> 38:16.393
Some kind of wiring schematic.
How much do we have?

38:16.480 --> 38:20.268
About a page and a half.
Mostly in Arabic, some of it in Russian.

38:20.360 --> 38:22.510
Get Assad over here now.

38:23.200 --> 38:24.918
Boorman, bring him.

38:32.920 --> 38:35.229
Do you know what this is?

38:36.640 --> 38:40.076
A list of electronic components,
build specifications,

38:40.160 --> 38:42.833
programming instructions for a detonator.

38:42.920 --> 38:48.358
But this is for a nuclear device.

38:49.960 --> 38:52.872
Is it possible Fayed
could've acquired a nuclear weapon?

38:52.960 --> 38:55.872
His organisation has tried
unsuccessfully in the past.

38:55.960 --> 38:58.110
- He may have found a way.
- Son of a bitch!

38:58.200 --> 39:03.558
- You knew about this all along, didn't you?
- Curtis! Curtis! Let go of him now!

39:04.240 --> 39:05.992
Assad, please.

39:07.560 --> 39:11.758
There is a reference file
at the bottom of the page. Sovtel Three.

39:11.840 --> 39:15.389
That's a compact bomb the Soviets made
till the late '80s - a suitcase nuke.

39:15.480 --> 39:17.596
- They're all accounted for?
- Destroyed.

39:17.680 --> 39:22.390
There was a claim a device was diverted to a
nuclear scientist with suspected terrorist ties.

39:22.480 --> 39:24.948
- Calls himself Saif al Din.
- Looking up his file.

39:25.040 --> 39:28.396
There won't be much. It's a code name,
means "sword of the faith".

39:28.480 --> 39:33.235
- Intelligence never discovered his identity.
- We have a six-year-old surveillance photo.

39:33.320 --> 39:34.673
Put it up.

39:38.640 --> 39:41.996
- Do you recognise him?
- Yes. I saw him with Fayed a year ago.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.878
- His name is Hasan Numair.
- Chloe, did you copy that?

39:44.960 --> 39:49.317
- Looking up his name.
- We need to know where this man is now.

39:49.400 --> 39:54.713
I think we already do. He's a terrorist being
released from the Palmdale military prison.

39:54.800 --> 39:57.712
Call the White House.
Bring up the feed from the airfield.

39:57.800 --> 40:00.712
This is what Fayed
has been planning all along.

40:00.800 --> 40:04.429
These bombings were designed
to make you free this man.

40:04.520 --> 40:06.431
Son of a bitch.

40:06.520 --> 40:10.798
- Have they freed the prisoners?
- It'll be a couple minutes till they're in the air.

40:10.880 --> 40:15.954
Call the airfield. Send it to my office.
Tell the president I'm stopping the release.

40:16.040 --> 40:20.909
This is Nadia Yassir from CTU. I need
to speak to the president, priority three.

40:25.040 --> 40:29.477
This is Buchanan. The prisoner you want
is Hasan Numair. I'll send his picture.

40:29.560 --> 40:31.710
Roger that. Let's move it, boys.

40:38.240 --> 40:40.913
Prisoner Numair, raise your hand.

40:44.040 --> 40:46.508
- I've got the photo.
- Copy that.

40:49.520 --> 40:53.638
Prisoner Numair, identify yourself now.

40:54.920 --> 40:56.797
We need to go over every square inch.

40:56.880 --> 40:59.440
Someone tell the sarge
he needs to get up here now.

40:59.520 --> 41:01.795
(gunshot)

41:07.360 --> 41:09.920
Hurry up. Fayed is waiting for you.

42:08.200 --> 42:10.191
