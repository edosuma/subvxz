is 50,000 tickets.

11:59.149 --> 12:03.924
You can get the ice cubes, the
eraser or the dragon stickers.

12:03.924 --> 12:08.098
- I want the big tiger.
- You can't have the big tiger.

12:08.098 --> 12:10.130
But if you put those stickers
under your pillow,

12:10.130 --> 12:11.501
when you wake
up in the morning,

12:11.501 --> 12:13.433
that tiger'll be at
the foot of your bed.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.766
- Yay!
- Yay!

12:17.267 --> 12:19.439
Yeah, he'll be disappointed,
but, you know,

12:19.439 --> 12:22.442
at least when he wakes up Sunday
he'll still have friends!

12:22.442 --> 12:25.745
Look, come on...
What do you expect me to do?

12:25.745 --> 12:27.818
I can't just tell
my dad I hate the room.

12:27.818 --> 12:29.820
You saw him. [mimics Robby]
"Do you like it?

12:29.820 --> 12:32.122
I did it just for you, Bud."

12:32.122 --> 12:36.426
I just wish there was
some way he could see
how humiliating it is.

12:42.833 --> 12:46.867
Daddy, you promised you'd say
good night before you went to
your concert.

12:46.867 --> 12:49.069
[Robby] Hold on,
I'm comin', darling!

12:50.440 --> 12:53.874
Marty, I'm not walkin'
out on stage in this shirt.

12:53.874 --> 12:56.847
It's humiliating!
Hold on just a second...

12:58.048 --> 12:59.479
Night, darlin'.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.853
Sweet dreams.

13:02.853 --> 13:06.556
I'm serious, Marty, I look
like a dang motel sign.

13:08.889 --> 13:12.292
- I want that shirt.
- Why?

13:12.292 --> 13:14.264
Let me paint you a picture...

13:19.870 --> 13:22.833
- Father?
- Yes, kitten?

13:22.833 --> 13:26.937
You do so much for me, I want
to do something special for you.

13:28.238 --> 13:32.382
- Surprise!
- Good heavens!

13:32.382 --> 13:36.286
You wore a shirt like this when
I was a mere slip of a girl,

13:36.286 --> 13:38.518
and I'll never forget how
handsome you looked in it.

13:38.518 --> 13:43.053
Ah. That's so sweet of you,
Princess...

13:43.053 --> 13:47.197
...but it was the past.
I've grown. I've changed.

13:47.197 --> 13:53.203
- [bell dinging]
- As have you. Which means...

13:53.203 --> 13:56.366
I've made a horrible mistake
with that bedroom of yours.

13:56.366 --> 14:01.271
- Can you ever forgive me?
- Of course I can.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.578
Will you stop that?
It's creeping me out.

14:08.578 --> 14:10.150
Fine, give me the shirt.

14:10.150 --> 14:12.152
Fine, give me
50,000 tickets.

14:12.152 --> 14:14.254
Where am I gonna get
50,000 tickets?!

14:14.254 --> 14:16.426
What does 50,000 tickets get?

14:16.426 --> 14:19.990
How 'bout a brand-new
20 dollar bill?

14:19.990 --> 14:22.532
How 'bout some
personal space, freak?

14:22.532 --> 14:24.294
OK, fine, a 50.

14:24.294 --> 14:27.867
Forget it. I want
the big tiger.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.639
Everybody wants
the big tiger.

14:29.639 --> 14:33.473
No, no! No, you don't!
This is carnival junk!

14:33.473 --> 14:35.305
The stitching is terrible!

14:35.305 --> 14:37.507
It's gonna fall apart
before you take it home.

14:37.507 --> 14:40.610
- [Lilly] Uh...
- Cheese and biscuits,
this thing is well made!

14:40.610 --> 14:43.013
Yeah, that's why
it's 50,000 tickets!

14:44.554 --> 14:46.656
Stop it!
You're hurting Hannah!

14:47.587 --> 14:50.560
Hannah,
as in Montana?

14:50.560 --> 14:52.622
Yes, weird, as in "doh."

14:55.895 --> 14:59.169
- Keep her here.
- You're going all the way home?

14:59.169 --> 15:04.004
I don't have to. Vacuum-packed
emergency Hannah kit.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.376
After four years of
"I can't, but Hannah can"

15:06.376 --> 15:08.578
- you learn a little something.
- No way.

15:08.578 --> 15:10.680
Yes, way. The guys at the
space shuttle made it for me.

15:10.680 --> 15:12.382
I made 'em a mix CD. Oh!

15:12.382 --> 15:15.685
They also gave me a...
Thanksgiving dinner for eight.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.690
Yeah, right.

15:29.499 --> 15:33.703
Don't worry. I've read that
even at 16, 17, you can still
have a growth spurt.

15:33.703 --> 15:39.709
- I'm 19.
- You're 19? Wow.

15:39.709 --> 15:41.111
I mean, it wouldn't be so bad

15:41.111 --> 15:43.613
if you didn't have such
an abnormally large head.

15:45.015 --> 15:46.276
Hey! I've got a great idea.

15:46.276 --> 15:47.647
Why don't we go over
to your house

15:47.647 --> 15:49.219
and see if your cousin's
home from modeling

15:49.219 --> 15:52.352
[stammering] b-b-b-b...

15:52.352 --> 15:54.124

15:55.955 --> 15:58.158
Doubt it. She's probably
hanging with her dumb boyfriend.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.732
- She has a boyfriend?
- Yeah, he thinks he's all cool

16:02.732 --> 16:05.335
'cause he's a "professional"
football player.

16:05.335 --> 16:08.098
Huh...

16:08.098 --> 16:10.000
You know what
I just realized?

16:10.000 --> 16:12.742
- Get out.
- What?

16:12.742 --> 16:15.475
Yeah. Get out of my house!

16:15.475 --> 16:17.677
- Was it something I said?
- It was everything you said!

16:17.677 --> 16:19.149
Starting with
"who wants pie"

16:19.149 --> 16:21.081
and ending with
"abnormally large head!"

16:23.013 --> 16:24.414
Hi.

16:24.414 --> 16:27.617
Uh, TJ, I locked myself
out of the house
and I need to use your keys.

16:27.617 --> 16:30.990
You're in luck. TJ and
his keys were just leaving.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.063
You've been so sweet to him.

16:33.063 --> 16:37.467
Not like that jerk I just...
[sniffling] broke up with.

16:37.467 --> 16:40.300
- Broke up?
- That's too bad. Let's go.

16:40.300 --> 16:44.574
Whoa, whoa! Where you going,
neighbor cousin buddy?

16:44.574 --> 16:49.079
- Would you just excuse us
for one...?
- Yeah, but...

16:49.079 --> 16:53.383
You know that whole...
"Get out" thing?

16:53.383 --> 16:55.215
I was totally kidding!

16:55.215 --> 16:57.747
Test of friendship!
You passed!

16:57.747 --> 17:02.192
- She's a babe, isn't she?
- With a very small window
of availability!

17:02.192 --> 17:05.525
[sniffling] I could
really use a hug.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.297
Please don't
ruin this for me!

17:07.297 --> 17:09.499
Can I use your hot tub
whenever I want?

17:10.630 --> 17:14.064
Yeah. Just no more
man-made bubbles.

17:14.064 --> 17:15.265
All right.

17:19.069 --> 17:21.741
- Could you still use that hug?
- Yeah.

17:24.674 --> 17:27.347
- C'mon, cuz, let's get
something to eat.
- OK.

17:31.181 --> 17:33.052
- Do you want to join us?
- Yes!

17:33.052 --> 17:36.386
I mean... I could eat.

17:42.392 --> 17:44.434
- I want a new room.
- I want the tiger.

17:44.434 --> 17:48.198
- I want a new room.
- I want the tiger! Ha!

17:48.198 --> 17:51.141

move him to the other barn.
