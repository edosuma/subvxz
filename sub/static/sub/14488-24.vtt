11:54.840 --> 11:58.177
Negative. Rosemary,
release the Surgeon General.

11:59.803 --> 12:01.180
ROSEMARY: Get in there!
Ow!

12:01.263 --> 12:02.514
It's bright out here.

12:02.806 --> 12:05.392
VVernstrom, the
quarantine hasfafled.

12:05.476 --> 12:08.938
Give me a worst-case scenario.
And make it grim.

12:09.188 --> 12:10.689
I've prepared
some projections.

12:11.023 --> 12:12.733
Should the virus
escape Manhattan,

12:12.816 --> 12:15.694
this is how far it
will spread in 12 hours.

12:15.778 --> 12:19.073
This is 24 hours. This is
a Verizon coverage map.

12:19.156 --> 12:22.743
And in 36 hours, it will have
infected the entire planet.

12:22.826 --> 12:23.827
Options?

12:23.911 --> 12:26.622
We have only one option.
Protocol 62.

12:27.998 --> 12:30.668
Not possible. We don't have
nearly enough piranhas.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.836
Then Protocol 63 it is.

12:40.678 --> 12:43.389
Hooray!
They're letting us out!

12:43.514 --> 12:46.892
And hundreds of black hovercopters
are coming to welcome us!

12:52.815 --> 12:54.316
(ALL SCREAMING)

13:04.702 --> 13:08.622
They shrink-wrapped the whole city.
Well, it could be worse.

13:10.708 --> 13:12.293
It is worse!

13:40.404 --> 13:42.323
They're flying Manhattan
into the sun!

13:42.656 --> 13:44.325
They must have
been out of piranhas.

13:44.408 --> 13:45.951
They're gonna
kill the virus

13:46.035 --> 13:48.746
by exposing it to the heat
of our burning bodies!

13:49.079 --> 13:52.082
I'm just glad
I have my wool scarf.

13:52.291 --> 13:54.251
What good is a wool...

14:03.093 --> 14:05.763
Guys! Guys, you're never
gonna believe this!

14:05.846 --> 14:06.889
We know!

14:06.972 --> 14:10.100
They shmooped up Manhattan and
blasted us toward the sun!

14:10.184 --> 14:11.185
They did?

14:11.268 --> 14:13.937
Ah, so that's why
this was unguarded.

14:14.772 --> 14:18.776
<i>People of New New York, this is
Surgeon General Ogden Wernstrom.</i>

14:19.026 --> 14:21.195
Wern... (COUGHING)

14:23.072 --> 14:24.073
...strom!

14:24.198 --> 14:26.867
<i>No doctor likes hurling his
patients into the sun,</i>

14:26.950 --> 14:30.287
<i>but since there is no way to make
a vaccine for the common cold...</i>

14:30.371 --> 14:31.580
(GRUNTS)

14:31.663 --> 14:33.665
There is a way
to make a vaccine!

14:33.791 --> 14:35.793
There is? Yay!

14:35.876 --> 14:37.753
Of course, there's a catch.
Woo-hoo!

14:38.504 --> 14:41.340
Yay! Yay!
So what's the catch?

14:41.548 --> 14:43.717
The vaccine
requires the original,

14:43.801 --> 14:46.637
unmutated,
20th century cold virus,

14:46.887 --> 14:49.431
so I need to grind you
into a paste.

14:50.391 --> 14:51.517
Professor, no!

14:51.642 --> 14:54.144
It's okay, Leela. This is
all my fault, sort of.

14:54.311 --> 14:56.021
If this will save you,
then please,

14:56.146 --> 14:57.898
turn me into
a virus milkshake.

14:58.148 --> 15:00.484
He consented!
You all heard it!

15:13.664 --> 15:16.166
Yes, sir, many of
these entries merit a ride

15:16.250 --> 15:18.377
in the mighty bosom
of our space shuttle.

15:19.002 --> 15:22.589
And then there's
your so-called entry.

15:23.799 --> 15:24.800
(SNEEZES)

15:26.176 --> 15:28.303
Jeez! Walk much, Gedgie?

15:28.637 --> 15:32.349
Absurd. You really think your guinea pig
can survive in the vacuum of space?

15:32.516 --> 15:34.893
He already survived
in the vacuum of my mom.

15:34.977 --> 15:36.687
I mean, my mom's vacuum.

15:36.854 --> 15:39.231
My experiment measures the
effect of microgravity

15:39.314 --> 15:41.525
on the propagation
of the common cold virus

15:41.608 --> 15:44.903
in an anaerobic environment,
i.e., space.

15:44.987 --> 15:45.988
Impressed?

15:46.113 --> 15:50.200
Damn right I am. That's some
dry, emotionless science.

15:50.701 --> 15:51.869
Nice job, son.

15:53.704 --> 15:54.705
(COUGHING)

15:57.875 --> 15:58.959
Hey, wait a second!

15:59.042 --> 16:01.420
I know where you can get
some 20th century cold virus

16:01.503 --> 16:02.504
without killing me!

16:02.671 --> 16:05.674
Hush, lad.
I'm totally in the zone.

16:05.757 --> 16:09.178
We just have to find the
Nerd Search '88 satellite.

16:09.386 --> 16:10.387
(GROANS)

16:10.471 --> 16:13.390
I don't know why I
even build these things.

16:18.979 --> 16:21.648
<i>Gunnery Chief Bender,
blast us out of quarantine.</i>

16:21.815 --> 16:22.900
Ave, ave, lady!

16:27.362 --> 16:28.614
Oh, fiddlepoop!

16:28.697 --> 16:30.157
Our weapons
aren't strong enough

16:30.240 --> 16:32.701
to puncture a thin
plastic tent that thick.

16:32.784 --> 16:34.411
No, but theirs are!

16:34.912 --> 16:36.455
(ALARM SOUNDING)

16:36.538 --> 16:39.166
Captain, a ship is attempting
to break the quarantine.

16:39.583 --> 16:42.836
Blow them to Bac:-O bits with
a well-placed warning shot.

16:42.961 --> 16:44.421
But... (GRUNTS)

16:44.505 --> 16:45.506
Oh...

16:51.553 --> 16:52.554
Oops.

16:52.804 --> 16:54.389
We'll find that
cold virus.

16:54.473 --> 16:57.017
The Nerd Search satellite was
launched on the space shuttle

16:57.100 --> 16:58.810
and released
into orbit.

16:59.102 --> 17:04.107
Hmm. All ancient satellites were
swept up as space junk in 2113.

17:04.273 --> 17:07.027
I actually knew that offhand.
I'm Facebooking right now.

17:08.945 --> 17:09.988
Aha!

17:10.071 --> 17:15.035
That satellite was scuttled on
Enceladus, Saturn's main dump moon.

17:15.160 --> 17:16.494
Let's dump it up!

17:25.337 --> 17:29.466
This is the exact location of the
dump, but there's nothing here.

17:29.550 --> 17:31.635
BENDER: (SIGHS) Can we
please go home and die now?

17:31.718 --> 17:32.803
I'm with Bender.

17:32.886 --> 17:36.223
Whatever was here has been covered
by centuries of ice buildup.

17:36.557 --> 17:40.477
No! It's under here somewhere! We
just have to bust our way down.

17:40.727 --> 17:44.856
Remember the code of the ice.
Thin and crispy, way too risky!

17:45.190 --> 17:47.484
(GRUNTING)

17:47.859 --> 17:48.860
(ALL YELLING)

17:49.820 --> 17:50.821
(ALL GROAN)

17:51.488 --> 17:53.782
LEELA:
I found the satellite!

17:55.826 --> 17:59.037
Lefsjusthope the
experiment's still in here.

17:59.621 --> 18:01.331
Yes! We're saved!

18:03.500 --> 18:07.004
And now, to present the awards,
our very special guest.

18:07.337 --> 18:08.547
He walked on the Moon,

18:08.630 --> 18:11.800
and now he is judging
a high school science contest.

18:12.009 --> 18:17.222
Truly a man who can and will
do anything, Dr. Buzz Aldrin!

18:19.433 --> 18:21.685
Wow. I could have used
an introduction like that

18:21.768 --> 18:23.854
when I first met
the Moon Men.

18:24.021 --> 18:25.105
(ALL CHUCKLING)

18:26.607 --> 18:28.317
But seriously,
there are Moon Men.

18:28.400 --> 18:29.526
<i>(CLEARS THROAT)</i>

18:29.610 --> 18:32.362
Okay, this year's
Nerd Search runner-up

18:32.446 --> 18:34.615
is a young man
who devised a way

18:34.698 --> 18:37.409
to add and subtract
in zero gravity.

18:37.868 --> 18:41.580
Vijay Patel and his
calculator space hat!

18:41.747 --> 18:42.748
Whoo!

18:44.750 --> 18:45.792
Whoo!

18:45.876 --> 18:47.878
And now,
the grand prize winner

18:47.961 --> 18:51.256
whose experiment will be
launched into space...

18:54.551 --> 18:58.055
Look at that cocky smirk.
My money's on Gedgie.

18:58.263 --> 19:00.724
Yeah? He may have brains,
but I have heart.

19:01.099 --> 19:02.559
Josh Gedgie!

19:02.893 --> 19:04.561
(LAUGHING)

19:05.395 --> 19:07.064
I'll bring
the car around.

19:19.409 --> 19:24.414
What a well-prepared virus culture.
This will make a fine vaccine.

19:24.498 --> 19:26.166
Good thing
Gedgie won.

19:26.333 --> 19:29.169
My dumb experiment wouldn't
have lasted an hour in space,

19:29.252 --> 19:30.754
let alone 1,000 years.

19:30.837 --> 19:34.424
Besides, Buzz Aldrin ran over my
guinea pig in the parking lot.

19:34.633 --> 19:38.804
Okay. Come on, gang, let's
go inoculate everyone

19:38.887 --> 19:42.265
and cram Manhattan
back into its rightful hole.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.277
This may hurt a little.

19:54.861 --> 19:55.862
Ow!

19:56.530 --> 19:58.615
Now I'll give you
the shot.

19:59.491 --> 20:01.535
You saved
millions of lives, Fry.

20:01.785 --> 20:04.830
You should feel proud, no matter
what your dad said to you.

20:15.966 --> 20:19.136
You still haven't thanked rne for
pulling you out of the lake, soldier.

20:19.261 --> 20:20.762
I could have
flip-flopped out.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.431
I know that.

20:25.267 --> 20:29.062
Look,son, I know I give you
the business sometimes,

20:29.146 --> 20:30.439
but if I'm hard on you,

20:30.522 --> 20:34.109
it's only 'cause I want you to
grow up strong and resilient.

20:34.192 --> 20:37.863
Some day, you may face
adversities so preposterous,

20:37.946 --> 20:39.948
I can't even
conceive of them.

20:40.115 --> 20:43.243
But I know you'll pull
through and make me proud.

20:43.869 --> 20:45.287
I love you, son.

20:57.799 --> 21:00.969
YANCY SR.: Now bundle up. I
don't want you getting frozen.
