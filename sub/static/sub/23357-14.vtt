09:42.382 --> 09:43.733
(DOOR CLOSES)

09:44.984 --> 09:48.519
Nicolette Nevin's bail has been paid.

09:48.555 --> 09:50.354
They'll release her within the hour.

09:50.390 --> 09:51.756
I told you, all I needed was ten percent

09:51.791 --> 09:53.024
to pay the bail bondsman.

09:53.059 --> 09:55.286
This was cleaner and faster.

09:55.642 --> 09:59.243
Money makes problems disappear
in our legal system.

09:59.708 --> 10:01.532
It's not a level playing field.

10:01.568 --> 10:03.401
It's just like medicine.

10:05.972 --> 10:07.972
Obviously, I'm grateful.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.009
You're my son.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.911
I'd do anything for you.

10:15.481 --> 10:16.881
This is a...

10:16.916 --> 10:19.436
new beginning between us.

10:19.919 --> 10:24.088
And I have a plan
in the works for our future.

10:28.127 --> 10:29.527
So Mina and Micah.

10:29.562 --> 10:31.047
That's a shock, huh?

10:31.082 --> 10:33.731
Is it possible
that she's in love with him?

10:33.766 --> 10:35.245
In love? Are you joking?

10:35.280 --> 10:36.767
Mina doesn't do relationships.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.102
She's just getting laid.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.937
The sex must have been amazing.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.706
It did give him a heart attack.

10:41.741 --> 10:43.207
It's the way I'd want to go out.

10:43.242 --> 10:44.308
Death by coitus.

10:44.344 --> 10:45.943
Preferably with Mina.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.446
Oh.

10:48.481 --> 10:52.316
No. Olivia. Long time no see.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.752
I feel like it's only been
a couple weeks.

10:54.787 --> 10:56.921
- Eight days, actually.
- IRVING: Olivia.

10:56.956 --> 10:58.199
- Yes?
- You're not sick.

10:58.234 --> 11:00.985
I most definitely am very seriously ill.

11:01.020 --> 11:04.428
The disease you have is hypochondria!

11:05.241 --> 11:06.464
I can arrange a psych appointment.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.165
I have a rash

11:08.201 --> 11:10.234
- and a persistent cough.
- Okay.

11:10.269 --> 11:12.035
- I...
- Just come here.

11:12.070 --> 11:13.971
- (STAMMERS)
- It's all good.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.840
I will check her out. Give me the chart.

11:15.875 --> 11:17.875
- All good.
- Thank you. My hero.

11:18.945 --> 11:20.629
Okay. Lay it on me.

11:20.665 --> 11:21.830
I have rat-bite fever.

11:21.865 --> 11:23.617
Have you been in close proximity
to rodents?

11:23.652 --> 11:25.333
I hear them in the wall sometimes.

11:25.368 --> 11:26.482
Okay, it's called rat-bite fever.

11:26.518 --> 11:27.758
The operative word is "fever."

11:27.794 --> 11:28.854
Your temperature is normal.

11:28.855 --> 11:29.972
Can it be hantavirus?

11:30.007 --> 11:31.364
Again, you would have a fever.

11:31.365 --> 11:32.631
Leptospirosis?

11:32.666 --> 11:35.299
Leptospirosis is contracted
by swimming in water

11:35.324 --> 11:36.957
in which animals have recently urinated.

11:36.992 --> 11:38.525
Have you been river rafting in Kenya?

11:38.561 --> 11:40.060
Well, I read online

11:40.096 --> 11:41.895
that there was a factory worker
in Arizona

11:41.931 --> 11:45.587
who got it when he drank from a
rat-urine contaminated soda can.

11:45.622 --> 11:46.667
Did you drink

11:46.702 --> 11:49.203
from a contaminated soda can
in a factory in Arizona?

11:49.238 --> 11:51.672
There's one more possibility.

11:52.237 --> 11:54.875
Can this rash be caused by lymphoma?

11:54.910 --> 11:57.578
Because I just had
my first round of chemo.

11:58.201 --> 11:59.913
Chemo? You had chemo?

11:59.949 --> 12:01.482
Mm-hmm.

12:01.517 --> 12:03.083
Who diagnosed you with lymphoma?

12:03.119 --> 12:05.185
Dr. Lane Hunter.

12:14.406 --> 12:15.872
Hey. Conrad, where is he?

12:15.908 --> 12:17.674
Over there.

12:17.709 --> 12:18.820
(GRUNTS)

12:20.045 --> 12:22.112
Hey, Conrad. Look at this.

12:32.090 --> 12:34.891
- (LOCK BUZZES)
- Nevin, Nicollete. Let's go.

12:34.927 --> 12:37.027
- Where to?
- Just hurry up.

12:37.782 --> 12:39.325
Come on, come on, come on.

12:41.800 --> 12:43.366
Your boyfriend said you're a nurse.

12:43.402 --> 12:44.734
He's not my boyfriend.

12:44.770 --> 12:46.403
Well, maybe he is.

12:46.438 --> 12:47.537
I saw him.

12:47.573 --> 12:49.439
Nice problem you got there.

12:49.474 --> 12:50.640
Let's go.

12:52.244 --> 12:53.998
Name's Jenny.

12:54.033 --> 12:56.279
She's been like that
for the last 30 minutes.

12:56.315 --> 12:58.048
Confused, can barely speak.

12:58.083 --> 13:00.684
And when it started,
she got really light-headed.

13:01.264 --> 13:02.752
She's not my girlfriend.

13:04.287 --> 13:05.954
Well, maybe she is.

13:08.781 --> 13:10.026
Sounds like low blood sugar.

13:10.062 --> 13:11.361
Hypoglycemia.

13:11.396 --> 13:12.629
Are you diabetic, Jenny?

13:12.664 --> 13:15.198
Are you taking any new medication?

13:15.234 --> 13:16.700
Antibiotics.

13:16.735 --> 13:18.406
MULLINS: A sinus infection.

13:18.971 --> 13:20.949
NIC: SMX-TMP. It's a sulfa drug.

13:20.985 --> 13:22.986
Sulfa drugs can sometimes make the body

13:23.022 --> 13:25.408
produce too much insulin.
It's rare, but it happens.

13:25.444 --> 13:27.143
You need glucose.

13:27.179 --> 13:28.378
Do you have anything sugary? Any candy?

13:28.413 --> 13:30.747
- I have orange juice.
- Perfect.

13:30.782 --> 13:32.415
You're gonna be fine.

13:32.451 --> 13:33.813
You just have to get
your prescription changed

13:33.848 --> 13:35.157
and then maybe go see a doctor.

13:35.193 --> 13:36.653
It could be a kidney issue.

13:36.688 --> 13:38.188
That should help.

13:44.849 --> 13:46.796
Thank you.

13:48.967 --> 13:50.500
What she said.

13:50.535 --> 13:51.935
Oh, and you're free to go.

13:51.970 --> 13:54.104
- What?
- You made bail.

13:54.139 --> 13:56.973
Let's get you your clothes
and get you out of here.

14:03.001 --> 14:05.001

14:05.615 --> 14:07.074
_

14:10.186 --> 14:12.835
_

14:12.859 --> 14:14.424
LEONARD: Extremely high risk.

14:14.459 --> 14:17.627
WALTERS: As in "bleed out,
die on the table" high risk.

14:17.663 --> 14:19.796
Even if you manage to get in safely,

14:19.831 --> 14:21.831
the scar tissue makes it hard
to see the heart.

14:21.867 --> 14:25.035
At that point, odds are
you could cut the wrong vessel.

14:25.070 --> 14:27.137
Only someone with a God-given talent

14:27.172 --> 14:29.172
and an ego the size of Texas
would try it.

14:36.248 --> 14:39.549
AUSTIN: Well, well, well.
What do we have here?

14:39.584 --> 14:41.618
You're not, uh, looking
to have lunch, are you?

14:41.653 --> 14:44.654
Because I don't believe crow
is on the menu.

14:47.259 --> 14:48.825
Don't fret, princess.

14:48.860 --> 14:50.331
I can save your patient.

14:51.165 --> 14:52.796
You know about Micah Stevens?

14:52.831 --> 14:54.230
Whole hospital is talking about him.

14:54.266 --> 14:56.700
Apparently, the brother
has quite a fan base.

14:56.735 --> 14:58.535
I spoke to three
top cardiothoracic surgeons

14:58.570 --> 14:59.970
and they all say

15:00.005 --> 15:01.805
operating on Micah is likely to kill him.

15:01.840 --> 15:03.373
Yeah, well, you spoke to hacks.

15:03.408 --> 15:05.408
I wouldn't trust them to cut cheese.

15:05.444 --> 15:07.967
MINA: Micah is a gentle, decent man,

15:08.002 --> 15:09.518
a great teacher who loves his kids.

15:09.553 --> 15:11.348
He has more integrity
in his little finger...

15:11.383 --> 15:13.383
Blah, blah, blah, spare me. Whatever.

15:13.418 --> 15:14.918
I don't care that he's Mother Teresa.

15:14.953 --> 15:16.886
I think it's an interesting case
and I'll take it.

15:16.922 --> 15:18.555
Micah's not a science experiment.

15:18.590 --> 15:19.823
If you don't believe he has a chance...

15:19.858 --> 15:21.524
Well, his odds do suck,

15:21.560 --> 15:23.660
but in my hands, they're not zero.

15:23.695 --> 15:26.062
Besides that, I can't give you a number.

15:26.098 --> 15:28.765
I mean, we're all guessing
every time we scrub in, right?

15:28.800 --> 15:31.868
I mean, there's always
art balanced with science.

15:31.903 --> 15:35.005
And fortunately,
I happen to be Rembrandt.

15:35.710 --> 15:36.873
Kill me now.

15:36.908 --> 15:38.575
You know what I like about you, Okafor?

15:38.610 --> 15:40.777
You're arrogant, just like me.

15:40.812 --> 15:43.446
What I don't like
about you is you're not me.

15:43.482 --> 15:45.682
We'll schedule for surgery
if Micah agrees.

15:45.717 --> 15:47.250
He already has.

15:51.390 --> 15:52.689
Let me guess.

15:52.724 --> 15:54.724
You're all-in because if he dies

15:54.760 --> 15:56.526
within a year of his surgery,

15:56.561 --> 15:59.295
it's a black mark on
Chastain's transplant program.

15:59.331 --> 16:02.198
And without surgery,
that baby is going to blow.

16:02.234 --> 16:04.067
I looked at the imaging.

16:04.102 --> 16:05.869
It's sooner rather than later.

16:05.904 --> 16:09.660
So, let's give Micah a chance.

16:10.995 --> 16:12.409
And Chastain.

16:14.479 --> 16:16.112
That's what you wanted, right?

16:18.836 --> 16:20.617
Rembrandt, baby.

16:22.754 --> 16:23.920
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

16:23.955 --> 16:26.456
- Nic, hi.
- Hey, Jess.

16:26.491 --> 16:27.791
What are you doing here?

16:27.826 --> 16:29.128
Are they letting you come back?

16:29.163 --> 16:31.094
Nic. We've been jonesin' for you.

16:31.129 --> 16:32.595
Hey, um, not yet.

16:32.631 --> 16:33.930
Um, but look, where's Conrad?

16:33.965 --> 16:35.265
- Nic.
- Oh, I...

16:35.300 --> 16:37.767
- I'll see you later. Hey, Devon.
- Bye.

16:37.803 --> 16:38.880
Hey, Nic.

16:39.971 --> 16:41.905
How the hell did you pull that off?

16:41.940 --> 16:44.040
Later. This is more important.

16:48.380 --> 16:49.612
What's going on?

16:50.649 --> 16:51.881
Look at these labs.

16:51.917 --> 16:54.350
Blood work from my patient
in the ER, Olivia Tan.

16:54.386 --> 16:57.879
- Our frequent flier hypochondriac?
- Yes. You see anything abnormal?

16:57.915 --> 17:00.292
NIC: Nope. Perfectly healthy, as usual.

17:00.327 --> 17:01.658
DEVON: Well, last week, Dr. Hunter

17:01.693 --> 17:03.993
diagnosed Olivia with lymphoma.

17:04.029 --> 17:06.229
And she just received
her first round of chemo.

17:08.666 --> 17:10.366
She has no cancer markers at all.

17:12.871 --> 17:15.505
Lane's giving chemo to patients
who don't even have cancer.

17:19.606 --> 17:22.334
Nic warned us that Dr. Hunter
was overdosing cancer patients

17:22.358 --> 17:24.092
- with aggressive chemo.
- Which is Medicare fraud.

17:24.127 --> 17:26.493
Tough to prove,
particularly since Dr. Hunter

17:26.530 --> 17:28.329
keeps all of her patient
records at her clinics.

17:28.365 --> 17:31.399
And Dr. Pravesh just discovered
that she's also been diagnosing

17:31.435 --> 17:33.558
healthy patients with cancer,

17:33.593 --> 17:35.270
which explains her miraculous cures

17:35.305 --> 17:37.472
because some of her patients
were never sick to begin with.

17:37.507 --> 17:38.907
NIC: Including Lily Kendall.
She had a form of cancer

17:38.942 --> 17:41.465
that you can get from aggressive chemo.

17:41.501 --> 17:42.652
Look, Th-this is absurd.

17:43.348 --> 17:44.805
You're trying to tell me

17:44.830 --> 17:46.813
Dr. Hunter gave Lily Kendall cancer

17:46.838 --> 17:48.431
and then killed her to cover it up?

17:48.432 --> 17:49.698
Lily was in the process
of getting a second opinion.

17:49.733 --> 17:52.467
That oncologist would have
demanded her records.

17:52.502 --> 17:53.702
Which would have shown
her original diagnosis.

17:53.737 --> 17:56.237
Dr. Hunter consistently refused
to share them.

17:56.273 --> 17:58.206
And Nic tried to get her records
after Lily died

17:58.241 --> 18:00.175
and Dr. Hunter set her up
and had her arrested.

18:00.210 --> 18:02.911
You're accusing Dr. Hunter
of cold-blooded murder,

18:02.946 --> 18:04.679
one of the best doctors in the hospital.

18:04.715 --> 18:06.481
Wouldn't believe that in a million years.

18:06.516 --> 18:08.683
It's not necessary that you
believe us because we've already

18:08.719 --> 18:10.051
contacted the FBI

18:10.087 --> 18:12.554
and they're getting a warrant
to seize Lane's records.

18:13.034 --> 18:14.556
The truth is gonna come out, Dr. Bell.

18:14.591 --> 18:18.026
You called the FBI? Without telling me?

18:18.061 --> 18:19.928
NIC: It's required by law,

18:19.963 --> 18:21.529
considering what Dr. Pravesh discovered.

18:21.565 --> 18:23.198
CONRAD: We're here
to make sure you remove

18:23.233 --> 18:25.166
all of Dr. Hunter's patients
from her care.

18:25.202 --> 18:27.502
And if you don't, moving forward,

18:27.537 --> 18:29.804
both you and Chastain will be liable.

18:45.024 --> 18:46.888
Okay, well, this... it's shocking.

18:47.610 --> 18:49.391
And I don't know what to believe.

18:51.948 --> 18:55.130
But I will suspend
Dr. Hunter's privileges,

18:55.165 --> 18:56.464
pending a full investigation.

18:56.500 --> 18:59.304
And I would ask you not to say anything.

18:59.876 --> 19:01.267
This is her career

19:01.302 --> 19:04.400
and Chastain's reputation
that is on the line.

19:04.435 --> 19:07.976
These accusations will have to
be backed up with hard evidence.

19:09.632 --> 19:10.800
They will be.

19:24.456 --> 19:25.755
You ready?

19:26.899 --> 19:29.625
I'll be with you in surgery all the way,

19:29.661 --> 19:31.404
looking out for you.

19:34.657 --> 19:36.265
I may not see you again.

19:36.951 --> 19:40.169
Of course you will, on the other side.

19:40.205 --> 19:43.739
What other side? The really,
really far other side?

19:44.292 --> 19:46.043
In recovery.

19:48.212 --> 19:50.179
You can be honest with me, Mina.

19:50.715 --> 19:52.915
I know a Hail Mary pass when I see one.

19:53.634 --> 19:54.951
Whatever happens, I'm at peace with it.

19:54.986 --> 19:56.452
Don't talk like that.

19:56.488 --> 19:59.755
I've had one miracle, my new heart.

19:59.791 --> 20:03.227
