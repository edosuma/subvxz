02:02.039 --> 02:03.080
Yes!

02:05.459 --> 02:08.419
{\pos(192,210)}How did you ever come up
with an idea like "crazy bowling"?

02:08.586 --> 02:10.262
{\pos(192,210)}I Googled "girls having fun,"

02:10.387 --> 02:13.596
{\pos(192,210)}and after wading through
97,000 pages of porn,

02:13.721 --> 02:15.374
I found "crazy bowling."

02:16.704 --> 02:17.636
{\pos(192,210)}That's odd.

02:17.804 --> 02:20.359
There isn't a single man
in this whole bowling alley.

02:22.289 --> 02:24.412
... the pin!

02:29.928 --> 02:33.530
{\pos(192,210)}It's pretty sad when I can't
pick up a guy on Super Nacho Tuesday.

02:33.665 --> 02:35.216
{\pos(192,210)}Where'd they all go?

02:35.344 --> 02:38.612
{\pos(192,210)}You know men. Probably
at a baseball game or a bar.

03:09.696 --> 03:11.485
{\pos(192,210)}Come on, you pansies!

03:11.609 --> 03:14.192
{\pos(192,210)}I've seen fiercer fights
in Parliament!

03:14.366 --> 03:18.082
{\pos(192,210)}Yes, what is this,
<i>Prime Minister's Question Time</i> ?

03:18.217 --> 03:19.882
{\pos(192,210)}Yeah, is it that?

03:37.595 --> 03:40.973
{\pos(192,210)}There's no better violence
than self-inflicted violence.

03:43.536 --> 03:45.331
{\pos(192,210)}Thanks for bringing me here, dad.

03:45.466 --> 03:47.412
I'll remember this day
on my deathbed.

03:48.598 --> 03:51.560
{\pos(192,210)}Not everyone has a deathbed, son.
You could die suddenly.

03:52.586 --> 03:56.150
Maybe some punk kid
will shoot me to get into a gang.

03:56.328 --> 03:57.150
Maybe.

03:58.868 --> 04:02.411
Three hours of half-naked guys
fighting like animals.

04:02.546 --> 04:04.281
Just like the ancient Romans.

04:04.416 --> 04:07.161
Yeah, except their empire
was falling apart.

04:08.107 --> 04:09.241
Stupid Romans.

04:10.667 --> 04:11.661
Ask him.

04:12.296 --> 04:16.103
Sir, could you sign my program
with a swear word?

04:16.956 --> 04:20.310
Filthy but obscure with
a subtle scatological undertone.

04:20.447 --> 04:21.870
Sure, no problem.

04:22.007 --> 04:24.143
- $25, please.
- Pay the man, boy.

04:25.686 --> 04:27.082
Now, listen, son,

04:27.206 --> 04:29.660
I know we saw some awesome
beat-downs tonight,

04:29.798 --> 04:32.533
{\pos(192,210)}but remember:
don't try this at home.

04:32.657 --> 04:34.362
{\pos(192,210)}Do it at the schoolyard.

04:34.495 --> 04:38.251
{\pos(192,210)}Someplace where, if you get hurt,
we can sue not just them

04:38.388 --> 04:42.111
{\pos(192,210)}but the school, the county, the state,
and that jackass Joe Biden.

04:43.455 --> 04:46.913
Python neck clinch and... out.

04:47.077 --> 04:50.771
Maybe I was promoted
to green belt too early.

04:50.908 --> 04:52.082
Next victim.

04:57.735 --> 04:59.293
{\pos(192,210)}Here we go.

05:03.055 --> 05:04.362
Where's your brother?

05:04.485 --> 05:07.261
I don't know,
chasing ducks, buried alive?

05:07.437 --> 05:10.010
He'll be missed. Let's move:
I got to collect pine cones.

05:10.185 --> 05:12.172
{\pos(192,210)}Die, die, die!

05:12.305 --> 05:14.983
{\pos(192,210)}Just follow the dies, Mom.

05:19.475 --> 05:22.652
Why me? Why me?

05:24.377 --> 05:26.792
I'm glad your father
isn't here to see this.

05:26.928 --> 05:28.911
Kill, kill, kill, kill!

05:34.048 --> 05:35.501
Bart, let him go.

05:35.665 --> 05:38.673
But Mom, I'm winning.
Look at this, his lunch money.

05:38.838 --> 05:41.502
God didn't give you legs
so you could use them as scissors.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.551
I was just doing the moves
I learned from <i>Ultimate Punching</i>.

05:45.346 --> 05:47.163
<i>Ultimate Punching</i> ?!

05:47.297 --> 05:50.531
- "Ultimate" makes everything worse.
- Not Frisbee.

05:50.655 --> 05:53.932
- Otto, don't you have a sack to hacky?
- Indeed I do.

05:54.106 --> 05:55.101
One...

05:55.228 --> 05:56.352
I messed up.

05:56.478 --> 05:58.651
One... I messed up.

05:58.787 --> 05:59.802
One...

05:59.927 --> 06:01.153
I messed up!

06:02.196 --> 06:05.112
I'm going to put a stop
to this <i>Ultimate Punching</i>.

06:05.286 --> 06:08.400
You can't stop an entire sport.
You'd need several other mothers,

06:08.527 --> 06:10.923
some sympathetic school officials
and clergymen...

06:11.497 --> 06:14.242
- A place to meet, some snacks...
- What else?

06:14.415 --> 06:18.003
A phone tree is invaluable.
How you fixed for staplers?

06:18.136 --> 06:20.850
Those fliers don't stick
to phone poles by themselves.

06:20.976 --> 06:23.923
Nelson, you really have
a knack for this.

06:24.918 --> 06:27.772
When I grow up,
I hope to go into event planning.

06:27.905 --> 06:30.261
Maybe someday
you can do Lisa's wedding.

06:30.975 --> 06:32.240
I'd like that.

06:40.027 --> 06:41.461
- My God.
- So violent.

06:41.596 --> 06:43.402
- Bumped his nose!
- He hit him.

06:46.348 --> 06:48.331
This goes on for a while.

06:49.025 --> 06:50.480
Call me a killjoy,

06:50.606 --> 06:53.373
but I think that because
this is not to my taste,

06:53.508 --> 06:55.450
no one else should be able
to enjoy it.

06:55.628 --> 06:56.953
I'm all over that.

06:58.006 --> 06:59.192
Don't do this.

06:59.328 --> 07:02.150
This sport is as fun for me
as having kids is for you.

07:03.156 --> 07:04.210
Tell her, dad.

07:04.337 --> 07:06.470
You love <i>Ultimate Punching</i>
even more than I do.

07:06.675 --> 07:08.930
<i>Ultimate Punching</i>
is exploitative, violent,

07:09.058 --> 07:11.050
and a bad influence
on our young people.

07:11.177 --> 07:13.003
Studies have shown
your mother is right.

07:13.125 --> 07:14.011
What the...?

07:15.158 --> 07:17.430
Chocolate, whipped cream, cherries!

07:17.558 --> 07:20.523
she got to you
with a piece of Black Forest cake.

07:20.696 --> 07:22.290
It wasn't just a piece,

07:22.415 --> 07:24.540
it was the whole cake!

07:24.675 --> 07:27.230
Frosting like snow

07:27.406 --> 07:31.402
on the eaves of a Bavarian castle!

07:33.497 --> 07:36.322
- Glad you didn't come cheap.
- I couldn't help it!

07:36.458 --> 07:38.733
She knew my one weakness:

07:38.868 --> 07:40.913
that I'm weak!

07:42.585 --> 07:44.582
<i>One, two, we say boo!</i>

07:44.755 --> 07:46.830
<i>Three, four, stop the gore!</i>

07:46.955 --> 07:48.552
<i>Five, six, who's got tix?</i>

07:48.796 --> 07:50.542
<i>Seven, eight, use that gate.</i>

07:52.377 --> 07:55.041
We need to take this
into the belly of the beast.

07:55.176 --> 07:57.053
Mr. Scalper, give me a ticket.

07:57.467 --> 07:58.702
I am not a scalper.

07:58.836 --> 08:01.233
I am a dude whose 200 friends
did not show up.

08:04.195 --> 08:07.061
- What do we do now?
- Let's talk about Marge behind her back.

08:07.188 --> 08:10.080
Have you ever noticed how that
baby of hers never says a thing?

08:10.217 --> 08:12.370
- I think it saw something awful.
- Me, too.

08:12.508 --> 08:15.453
- That's exactly what it is.
- What else could it be?

08:26.446 --> 08:28.633
That woman has natural breasts.

08:28.808 --> 08:30.132
This can't be good.

08:34.187 --> 08:37.302
I'm Marge Simpson,
and I will not rest

08:37.475 --> 08:40.400
until you tear down this septagon.

08:42.687 --> 08:45.300
Crazy dame.
Nobody tears down the septagon.

08:45.437 --> 08:47.733
Except for the arena crew because
<i>Hufflesnuffs on Ice</i>

08:47.905 --> 08:49.352
needs the space tomorrow.

08:50.776 --> 08:53.072
Wait a minute, I have a better idea.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.613
Marge, I'm Chett Englebrecht,

08:56.787 --> 08:59.313
UPKCC founder, commissioner,

08:59.438 --> 09:01.603
and public face of the sport.

09:05.375 --> 09:06.540
Pleased to meet you.

09:08.346 --> 09:09.510
Guys, please.

09:09.648 --> 09:11.840
When you yell like that,
no one can hear me.

09:14.138 --> 09:16.633
Chett, I'm here to ask you
one simple thing:

09:16.897 --> 09:18.373
please go out of business

09:18.505 --> 09:20.970
and donate all your profits
to charity.

09:22.566 --> 09:26.643
At least in other sports, they're trying
to put a ball in a net or a zone,

09:26.818 --> 09:29.442
but in this sport they don't put
anything in anything,

09:29.568 --> 09:31.520
and if they did,
I wouldn't want to see it.

09:32.615 --> 09:33.783
Okay, you win.

09:34.867 --> 09:37.231
Annoying lady,
you make a great point.

09:37.367 --> 09:39.991
I am going to shut down this sport.

09:40.166 --> 09:42.270
- Really?
- If you meet me

09:42.398 --> 09:45.163
in the septagon,
fight me, and beat me.

09:45.337 --> 09:47.451
What?! That's crazy.

09:47.625 --> 09:49.041
What's wrong, Marge?

09:49.165 --> 09:51.500
Do you have to ask your husband?

09:52.887 --> 09:54.690
- Good one!
- Zing!

09:56.726 --> 09:59.562
That flattens my soda pop.
You're on.

10:01.998 --> 10:04.182
- What'd I miss?
- Nothin'.

10:06.477 --> 10:08.690
Mom, you can't fight that guy.

10:08.827 --> 10:12.341
Yeah, Marge, he'll knock your
block off your beautiful block

10:12.468 --> 10:13.691
Thank you, Homie.

10:13.865 --> 10:16.923
Listen, of all the crazy things
I've ever done,

10:17.048 --> 10:19.490
This is the craziest,
and you're doing it.

10:19.665 --> 10:21.146
I can't back out.

10:21.264 --> 10:23.872
This is for a cause
that's bigger than I am.

10:24.006 --> 10:25.825
If Gandhi could go
without eating

10:25.949 --> 10:28.961
for a whole three-hour movie,
I can do this.

10:29.126 --> 10:30.372
Besides,
I'm a woman.

10:30.496 --> 10:32.060
He'll probably
go easy on me.

10:32.196 --> 10:33.610
Or kick the crap out of you.

10:33.738 --> 10:35.491
Watch your
language, moron.

10:49.737 --> 10:51.760
If I'm going to open a can
of whup-tushy,

10:51.897 --> 10:55.581
I'd better get in shape
with some rhythmic gymnastics.

11:05.597 --> 11:08.353
Someone's got to stop her
from going through with this fight.

11:08.476 --> 11:11.133
This goes against every
feminist bone in my body,

11:11.265 --> 11:13.500
but Dad, can't you control
your woman?

11:13.728 --> 11:16.673
How can I control her?
I have nothing to withhold!

11:16.805 --> 11:19.970
Oh, man, now she's writing
cutesy things with the ribbon.

11:20.205 --> 11:21.180
PEACE

11:22.647 --> 11:23.923
UNDERSTANDING

11:28.966 --> 11:30.353
Homer, this is bad.

11:30.487 --> 11:33.483
One unlucky punch and Marge
could be bedridden for life.

11:33.606 --> 11:36.521
Unable to move anything
but her left toe.

11:36.655 --> 11:37.543
Yeah.

11:38.728 --> 11:39.531
FEED ME

11:39.666 --> 11:43.590
Oh, Marge, if only I knew
what these paintings meant.

11:45.908 --> 11:49.230
I know the woman I loved is
still in there somewhere,

11:49.368 --> 11:51.351
behind all this nonsense.

11:52.217 --> 11:54.331
We've gotta get Marge some
professional training.

11:54.577 --> 11:57.532
Carl, do you know heavyweight
champ Drederick Tatum?

11:57.658 --> 12:00.302
You think just 'cause I'm black
I know all other black people?

12:00.475 --> 12:01.630
Well, I, uh, uh...

12:01.805 --> 12:04.000
Actually, Drederick and I
are very good friends.

12:04.135 --> 12:07.472
We met through Dr. Hibbert at
a party at Bleeding Gums Murphy's house.

12:07.647 --> 12:10.140
Well, Marge, you have definitely
come to the right crib.

12:10.706 --> 12:14.733
I'm always happy to impart my pugilistic
prowess to a punching parvenu.

12:14.975 --> 12:17.723
Now, the first lesson will
be to work the tattoos.

12:19.088 --> 12:20.560
Flaming skull.
Obama.

12:20.688 --> 12:22.651
Scooby-Doo. Scooby-Doo.
Scooby-Doo.

12:22.825 --> 12:24.292
Work "The Lord's Prayer."

12:24.417 --> 12:27.340
I'm gonna order some lion food.
Hello? Yeah, how you doin'?

12:27.468 --> 12:31.960
I'd like to order 2 gazelles, an impala,
and throw in a couple of wildebeests.

12:32.086 --> 12:34.553
Oh, and a two-liter bottle
of diet cherry cola.

12:34.687 --> 12:37.560
You just have one-liter bottles?
Okay, cancel the whole order.

12:39.007 --> 12:42.452
The second element of mixed
martial arts is jujitsu,

12:42.677 --> 12:45.993
in which we use an opponent's
strength against himself.

12:46.117 --> 12:49.130
But I sneak some of my
strength in there, too.

12:49.827 --> 12:52.522
Now, attack me
with great anger!

12:54.117 --> 12:55.253
Surprising move!

12:56.997 --> 12:58.402
Next: Homer, <i>hajime!</i>

13:02.097 --> 13:04.013
Now, we stick foot in mouth,

13:04.136 --> 13:05.873
tie arms like pretzel,

13:05.996 --> 13:08.820
and pop discs in spine
like bubble wrap.

13:12.608 --> 13:15.151
- Is he okay?
- Oh, he feels no pain.

13:16.576 --> 13:18.941
Sorry, my English
is not so good.

13:19.076 --> 13:21.683
I mean, he feels
only pain.

13:23.766 --> 13:25.311
Back when I wrestled at Yale,

13:25.446 --> 13:28.361
I was in the lightest weight category:
"ether weight."

13:28.496 --> 13:31.541
Now, get ready to face the wrath
of the "New Haven Nuisance!"

13:43.196 --> 13:45.220
Side-mount!
Takedown! Advantage!

13:45.346 --> 13:46.653
Reversal! Reversal!

13:46.775 --> 13:48.373
Clinch! Clinch, I say!

13:49.185 --> 13:51.783
Listen, I'm late
for a PTA meeting.

13:52.667 --> 13:53.962
In order to save money,

13:54.085 --> 13:56.483
the following presidents
will no longer be taught:

13:56.616 --> 13:59.922
Buchanan, Fillmore,
Pierce, Bush, Bush...

14:00.128 --> 14:01.590
could you please stop that?

14:01.888 --> 14:02.930
Saratoga slam!

14:03.058 --> 14:04.273
Aristotle's dilemma!

14:04.398 --> 14:06.842
Knickerbocker knucklebreaker!
And so on.

14:07.928 --> 14:10.400
Marge, I bet
we got ten minutes

14:10.538 --> 14:12.671
till the kids wake up.

14:14.426 --> 14:15.952
Marge! Marge!

14:16.185 --> 14:17.072
Marge!

14:17.607 --> 14:20.603
Tomorrow night your bedroom
will be the septagon.

14:20.777 --> 14:23.170
Your sleeping pill
will be my punches.

14:23.305 --> 14:25.293
By the way, what's that book
you're reading?

14:25.428 --> 14:26.653
<i>Eat, Pray, Love.</i>

14:26.826 --> 14:28.963
More like "Beat, Slay, Shove!"

14:29.087 --> 14:31.513
The fireworks begin tomorrow!

14:33.738 --> 14:35.042
I said tomorrow!

14:35.286 --> 14:37.370
No can do.
We're out of fireworks.

14:37.545 --> 14:39.103
Why'd you shoot 'em off now?

14:39.228 --> 14:41.193
I have trouble concentrating.

14:41.318 --> 14:43.273
I should be on antidepressants.

14:43.396 --> 14:44.542
Ugh. Where was I?

14:44.675 --> 14:45.993
"Beat, Slay, Shove."

14:46.127 --> 14:48.002
Right...
"Beat, Slay, Shove!"

14:48.197 --> 14:50.613
The fireworks start tomorrow!

14:52.297 --> 14:54.882
I found some more,
but that was it!

14:58.408 --> 15:01.600
A lot of people think
bullies are born awesome,

15:01.726 --> 15:04.192
but the fact is,
we have to train.

15:04.318 --> 15:07.712
You don't get garlic knots like
these unless you work the bag.

15:13.635 --> 15:15.400
Is there someone
in there?

15:15.525 --> 15:16.860
It's my own fault.

15:16.988 --> 15:19.492
I looked them in the eye when
I gave them my lunch money.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.611
Someone should tell
your principal!

15:21.748 --> 15:23.383
I'm well aware
of the situation.

15:32.375 --> 15:34.401
Mom,
I came here to tell you

15:34.528 --> 15:36.430
it's not too late
to back out.

15:36.566 --> 15:37.981
I can't back out,

15:38.107 --> 15:39.891
because if I fight him
tomorrow,

15:40.016 --> 15:43.341
it'll be a less violent world
for you kids in the future.

15:43.468 --> 15:45.230
There must be
a better way.

15:45.408 --> 15:46.722
There certainly is!

15:48.308 --> 15:50.663
Marge Simpson reporting
for duty!

15:52.206 --> 15:54.743
Dad, I keep telling you,
that won't work.

15:54.877 --> 15:55.943
Let's go, Marge.

15:56.065 --> 15:57.990
My class reunion starts
in an hour.

15:58.255 --> 16:00.362
Uh, Moe, I have
a confession to make.

16:00.487 --> 16:02.083
I'm just Homer
dressed as Marge.

16:02.328 --> 16:04.783
Yeah, but last year I took
Barney dressed as Marge.

16:04.906 --> 16:06.920
Think how much better
they'll think you look.

16:07.496 --> 16:10.582
Well, you'd better not leave me
and talk to your old friends all night.

16:10.706 --> 16:13.100
Keep talkin' like that and
I'll leave you here right now!

16:14.685 --> 16:17.643
Krusty, I'm honored
you invited me tonight.

16:17.857 --> 16:19.922
Yeah, I thought
a noisy public place

16:20.057 --> 16:22.851
would be the best spot to tell you
that I've been dating your wife.

16:23.307 --> 16:24.070
What?!

16:24.198 --> 16:26.133
Also, could you tell her
I'm dumping her?

16:26.257 --> 16:28.633
After 11 years,
the thrill is gone.

16:31.176 --> 16:33.170
I tried my best to
talk you out of this.

16:33.306 --> 16:35.920
But since you're going through
with it, I beg you,

16:36.058 --> 16:39.650
just stay out of his way
and don't get hurt.

16:39.785 --> 16:41.673
And, Mom, if you punch
him in the junk,

16:41.796 --> 16:43.383
you'll get no disrespect from me.

16:43.508 --> 16:45.693
Hey, Bart, did you know
that's a haiku?

16:52.535 --> 16:55.000
Time to square off in the ring...

16:55.128 --> 16:57.180
that is, The Septagon!

16:57.308 --> 16:59.262
In this corner,
weighing in at...

16:59.438 --> 17:01.971
Nobody needs to know that!
Skip ahead!

17:02.105 --> 17:04.482
Stands the "Mom
I'd Like To Fight"...

17:04.646 --> 17:06.650
Marge Simpson!

17:09.527 --> 17:13.401
And four obtuse angles over,
weighing in at 115 pounds,

17:13.758 --> 17:16.190
Chett Englebrecht!

17:22.365 --> 17:23.383
And, now...

17:23.506 --> 17:24.711
let's begin...

17:24.835 --> 17:27.040
to rumba!

17:27.276 --> 17:28.963
We've been ready for hours!

17:29.205 --> 17:30.723
I had car...

17:31.065 --> 17:32.963
trouble!

17:36.686 --> 17:38.642
Don't worry, Marge.
Don't want to hurt you.

17:38.877 --> 17:40.461
I knew it!

17:42.967 --> 17:45.990
That's the first time I ever hit
a woman I didn't love.

17:47.318 --> 17:48.150
Nine...

17:49.465 --> 17:51.272
Come on! Get back on your feet!

17:51.407 --> 17:53.883
- I believe in you!
- I'm doin' it, Moe!

17:54.018 --> 17:55.731
- Not you.
- Oh, thank God.

17:55.858 --> 17:57.032
The pressure's off.

17:58.178 --> 17:59.413
I'll save you,
Marge!

18:04.147 --> 18:05.431
Hit my Mom, will ya?

18:05.557 --> 18:07.683
I'm gonna knock you out
and moon your corpse.

18:07.817 --> 18:11.013
Heck, I'll fight anyone.
Except a man my own size.

18:21.797 --> 18:24.313
That's... my... son.

18:38.155 --> 18:39.142
Tap out!

18:39.278 --> 18:40.990
Don't make me
break your arm!

18:41.167 --> 18:44.082
Lady, why don't you break out
the lipstick and kiss my ass?

18:44.246 --> 18:47.003
There sure is a lot o' talkin'
for a professional fight.

18:47.166 --> 18:49.091
That's what you get
when you fight a woman.

18:50.337 --> 18:53.650
And they spend all day eating bonbons
and watching General Hospital.

18:53.775 --> 18:55.851
Which, by the way,
has never been better.

18:58.185 --> 19:00.432
Okay, I give! I give! I give!
You're better than me!

19:00.696 --> 19:02.431
Really?
Ooh, thank you.

19:02.638 --> 19:03.811
Now, let me go...

19:03.937 --> 19:05.680
turn your back and take a bow.

19:05.898 --> 19:06.980
Okeydoke.

19:11.017 --> 19:12.100
Thank you!

19:28.475 --> 19:30.620
I'd just like to say one thing.

19:30.796 --> 19:32.641
I only agreed to this fight

19:32.775 --> 19:35.142
because I wanted
to stop the violence.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.123
And sure I got into great shape

19:37.245 --> 19:38.703
and met some fun people,

19:38.825 --> 19:42.662
but I ended up discovering
my own dark side.

19:42.998 --> 19:44.171
So from now on,

19:44.297 --> 19:48.110
the only thing I'm fighting is
this cold I'm coming down with.

19:50.797 --> 19:52.973
Mom, that's
a beautiful thought.

19:53.266 --> 19:56.311
Yeah, well, I wish somebody
would've stuck around to hear it.

19:56.487 --> 19:57.850
Where did they all go?

19:57.975 --> 19:59.852
Two drunk guys were
fighting outside

19:59.976 --> 20:01.693
and everyone went
to watch.

20:01.868 --> 20:04.091
Can I go, Marge?
Can I? Can I?

20:04.225 --> 20:05.870
No. Let's go home.

20:06.037 --> 20:09.032
We can enjoy some mixed
"marital" arts.

20:09.166 --> 20:11.790
Oh, no holds barred.

20:13.815 --> 20:15.143
- Hey, Lise...
- Yeah?

20:15.265 --> 20:17.722
I don't know when we'll
be in a septagon again.

20:17.857 --> 20:19.352
Want to settle this bad blood

20:19.485 --> 20:21.762
that's been going on between us
since you were born?

20:23.096 --> 20:24.241
You're on.
