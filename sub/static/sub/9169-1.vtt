50:26.774 --> 50:28.242
IS that what
the HD stands for?

50:29.276 --> 50:31.950
No.
No, it stands for "High Def."

50:32.071 --> 50:33.118

50:43.040 --> 50:44.087
LUIS: Just her.

50:44.250 --> 50:45.923
She couldn't quite
cut it with our crew,

50:46.835 --> 50:47.882

50:48.254 --> 50:49.346

You're just not good enough.

And those two new dancers ain't
going to save you either.

(PANNNG)

53:39.258 --> 53:43.809
Listen, we've decided
that because of your dancing

53:43.971 --> 53:47.145
and the obvious tension between
you and my boy Luis here,

53:47.307 --> 53:49.401
that this Should make
for great television.

53:51.228 --> 53:54.072

54:01.864 --> 54:03.741
Thank you.
Thank you.

54:03.824 --> 54:04.950
We did it.

54:13.041 --> 54:14.884
That was insane.

54:14.960 --> 54:16.007
It was nuts.

54:16.211 --> 54:18.305
Not just the way
we made the show,

54:18.380 --> 54:20.428
but the way you
stood up to those judges.

54:20.591 --> 54:24.221
I mean, you were like, "Hell no!
Y'all are going to check us out!"

54:24.386 --> 54:26.980
Okay, I just wanted our crew
to have a fair shot.

54:27.139 --> 54:28.607
I give you
mad props for that.

54:29.683 --> 54:32.061
We finally feel like
a real crew, you know?

54:32.311 --> 54:35.155
And that wouldn't have
happened if it wasn't for you.

54:35.314 --> 54:36.361
I respect that.

54:37.775 --> 54:39.072
You're welcome.

54:43.238 --> 54:46.708
You can take that one to them.
I'll get the other one.

54:46.784 --> 54:47.831
Okay.

54:48.118 --> 54:50.120
Make them save me
a slice, though,

54:50.412 --> 54:51.459
I will.

54:53.916 --> 54:54.963
I'm in.

54:55.250 --> 54:56.672
So, where's Brandon at?

54:56.835 --> 54:58.803
I texted him.
He must still be taking his finals.

54:59.087 --> 55:03.137
Finals? He could've skipped
those to come celebrate, man.

55:03.300 --> 55:06.645
You don't skip finals, bro.
That's why they call them finals,

55:07.137 --> 55:08.855
The boy is trying to
get his edu-macation on.

55:09.014 --> 55:11.062
That don't make him any
different than the rest of us.

55:11.141 --> 55:13.109
We all just want to
dance for a living.

55:13.268 --> 55:16.397
Yeah, but we don't all have
filthy rich parents like he does.

55:16.563 --> 55:18.236
What are you
talking about?

55:18.607 --> 55:20.530
His family owns
half Of Texas.

55:21.568 --> 55:22.820
You didn't know?

55:22.986 --> 55:25.785

look like the Hammers.

that either?

55:42.756 --> 55:44.633
What do you know?

55:45.008 --> 55:47.102
Let me ask you
a serious question.

55:48.846 --> 55:52.942
Do y'all actually ever talk or just bone?
She just be like...

sleeping with the enemy.

Good stuff today.

56:08.490 --> 56:09.616
Thank you.

56:09.867 --> 56:13.167

was amazing.

Hey, I'm serious.

56:17.207 --> 56:19.050
Tina, is he
bothering you?

56:19.668 --> 56:22.672
No, he was just telling me how
much he liked our audition.

56:22.838 --> 56:25.182
No, I said I like
your audition.

56:25.507 --> 56:28.636
You're the one who brings
the heat to this group.

56:29.011 --> 56:31.264
Tina, did he tell you that
you're too good for us

56:31.346 --> 56:33.098
and that you should be
dancing with his crew?

56:33.390 --> 56:35.017
Yeah, he did, but...

56:35.100 --> 56:36.693
Tina, he's trying
to play you.

56:36.935 --> 56:39.859
Hey, calm down.
I told him I would stay with the HDS.

56:39.938 --> 56:40.985
Wen, good.

56:41.189 --> 56:43.191

good enough to dance with them.

what she's saying to me.

Stop starting trouble.

56:48.363 --> 56:49.910

56:50.073 --> 56:52.201
Tina, are you going to
let her dis you like that?

56:52.492 --> 56:54.244
I mean, I know if someone
in my crew called me out,

56:54.328 --> 56:55.375
we'd battle on the spot.

56:55.495 --> 56:58.749
Wow! I am not calling her out.
And if we're going to battle,

56:58.832 --> 57:02.336
we're going to do it as a crew
and take your sorry ass out.

57:03.045 --> 57:04.513

She's scared!

57:16.558 --> 57:20.028
If you were on the 718, baby,
you wouldn't run from nothing.

57:20.103 --> 57:21.150
Whatever.

57:21.229 --> 57:23.857
Maria, we got to
do this, okay?

57:24.191 --> 57:27.070
We're finally getting some props,
and it's time to back it up.

57:29.071 --> 57:32.075
Yeah, I'm as sure as you
were in that audition.

57:32.240 --> 57:33.366
That's pretty sure.

knock heads, we got to do something.

01:03:36.688 --> 01:03:37.905
Weil, that's messed up.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:41.447
What?

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:42.777
A Sf feel bafue?

01:03:42.944 --> 01:03:44.070
What were you thinking?

01:03:44.154 --> 01:03:45.997
Didn't you know losing
would ruin their confidence?

01:03:46.072 --> 01:03:49.542
I'm sorry, college boy, I'm not as smart as you.
I didn'1 know that

01:03:49.617 --> 01:03:50.664
Well, you should have.

01:03:50.744 --> 01:03:53.497
And you should have told me
you were just some rich kid

01:03:53.621 --> 01:03:55.419
slumming it down
here for grades.

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:58.047
Now, what does my family's money
have to do with any of this?

01:03:58.126 --> 01:03:59.878
Makes ii all
just a game for you.

01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:02.593
If things fall apart,
you can just leave,

01:04:02.756 --> 01:04:04.724
buf the FSSI Of US SFS StUCk
hв‚¬l'S to deal with ii.

01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:07.310
In case you haven't
noticed, I'm Still here.

01:04:07.385 --> 01:04:08.557
You're the one
that walked out.

01:04:08.636 --> 01:04:11.014
Because i'l['S over!
l quit!

01:04:11.097 --> 01:04:13.691
We can't win
without Tina!

01:04:15.268 --> 01:04:17.896
Fine, If that's the way you
feel, then you should quit.

01:04:18.313 --> 01:04:22.989
I'm going to go up there with my
crew, because I believe in us.

01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:43.422
Mafia.

01:04:45.048 --> 01:04:46.095
Are you okay?

01:04:46.299 --> 01:04:48.051
Yeah. why?

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:49.811
Today's your day off.

01:04:50.095 --> 01:04:53.816
What can I say?
I'd rather be here than anywhere else.

01:04:53.973 --> 01:04:55.941
Oh, Maria.

01:04:56.184 --> 01:04:59.063
Let'S talk.
Let's talk.

01:05:01.481 --> 01:05:03.984
You got to follow
your heart, Maria.

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:06.824
Is there a problem at home
or with your friends?

01:05:06.986 --> 01:05:08.078
Both.

01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:12.785
And this is how you deal with it?
Come to work?

01:05:12.951 --> 01:05:14.544
Yeah.
Huh. Good.

01:05:14.828 --> 01:05:16.876
Why, because you get
free labor?

01:05:16.955 --> 01:05:18.002
Of course.

01:05:18.164 --> 01:05:19.711
But I was
thinking, Maria,

01:05:19.874 --> 01:05:22.218
instead of getting
yourself into trouble,

01:05:22.293 --> 01:05:24.591
you chose to do
something constructive.

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:26.256
I like that.

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:30.264
Well, while I'r'r'l
being constructive,

01:05:30.385 --> 01:05:33.059
is there anything else
you want me to do?

01:05:33.138 --> 01:05:35.812
You go work your register, and
I'll take care of this later,

01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:38.564
You said no one works
the register but you,

01:05:38.726 --> 01:05:41.400
What, you expect me to take your word
for it that you were going to change?

01:05:41.479 --> 01:05:42.526
NO,

01:05:42.814 --> 01:05:45.283
I had to wait for you to
prove it, and you have.

01:05:45.442 --> 01:05:47.865
So, now I trust you.

01:05:49.195 --> 01:05:52.119
Thanks, Mr. Kapoor.
That means a lot.

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:54.125
BRANDON:
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:06:16.181 --> 01:06:17.228

01:06:18.141 --> 01:06:19.188
Try it again.

01:06:19.392 --> 01:06:22.316
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:06:37.076 --> 01:06:38.544
An right.

01:06:42.123 --> 01:06:43.545
So, you're back now?

01:06:43.958 --> 01:06:45.005
Why new

01:06:45.084 --> 01:06:48.054
I still got to do my community
service here anyway.

01:06:48.588 --> 01:06:50.135
Right.

01:06:51.799 --> 01:06:52.846
Hey,

01:06:53.134 --> 01:06:54.636
Hey, nook.

01:06:55.595 --> 01:06:58.565
I want to be here,
if that's okay with you.

01:06:59.974 --> 01:07:01.601
Whatever.

01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:23.672
Uh-uh.

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:25.758
Yo, is that Tina?

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.128
Okay, I'm just going to
go ahead and say it,

01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:29.258
Shit!

01:07:29.462 --> 01:07:31.214
She joined up
with the 718.

01:07:31.422 --> 01:07:34.392
That's scandalous, man.
How's she going to play us like that?

01:07:34.634 --> 01:07:36.853
Because she only thinks about
her damn self, that's how.

01:07:37.136 --> 01:07:38.683
BRANDON: We can't sweat
this right now, guys,

01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:40.728
MARIA: He's right.
We need to focus 0l'1 \l'1iS CFGW.

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:44.152
So, let's rock this thing,
all right? Bring it in.

01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:45.812
Let's get an HD on three,
an right?

01:07:45.979 --> 01:07:46.980
One, two, three...

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:48.155

01:07:56.197 --> 01:07:58.245
and last season
was no different.

01:07:59.367 --> 01:08:03.497
The 718 set this place on fire
with their off-the-chain routines,

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:05.048
and at the end
of this season,

01:08:05.164 --> 01:08:06.757
you're going to
see them perform

01:08:06.833 --> 01:08:08.426
against
the last crew standing.

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:14.174
There's already been some
behind-the-scenes madness

01:08:14.257 --> 01:08:16.760
with one crew jacking
another for a dancer,

01:08:16.843 --> 01:08:18.595
and we haven't
even started yet.

01:08:18.845 --> 01:08:20.267
So, what's
jumping off next?

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:23.934
Stay tuned, because you don't
want to miss Battle Zone.

Judges, who will it be?

01:10:46.993 --> 01:10:50.497
Well, it's obvious that this
year's talent is amazing,

01:10:50.788 --> 01:10:54.008
but, unfortunately,
somebody has to go.

01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:56.803
And rumgnr,

01:10:58.212 --> 01:10:59.634
it's Fanny Pak.

01:11:02.508 --> 01:11:03.680
Sorry, guys.

ALL; (DRAMATICALLY)
Ah! Ah,

01:11:07.346 --> 01:11:10.520
I'm sorry to see those guys go.
They were a hot crew.

01:11:10.683 --> 01:11:11.900
Yeah, but they
weren't the best.

01:11:12.185 --> 01:11:13.778
And you have
got to be the best

01:11:13.853 --> 01:11:15.480
if you're gonna go
up against the 71 8.

01:11:15.897 --> 01:11:16.989

01:11:17.231 --> 01:11:19.700

No, we don't.

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:41.719
Look, I know you think you know
what you're doing, but you don't.

01:11:42.381 --> 01:11:44.054
You need to stay
away from Luis.

01:11:44.217 --> 01:11:46.185
He said you were going to
say something like that.

01:11:46.344 --> 01:11:47.516
Trying to get me
back in the crew?

01:11:47.595 --> 01:11:49.723
Look, he's right, we need you.
But more importantly,

01:11:49.847 --> 01:11:51.224
I don't want to see
you get caught up.

01:11:51.599 --> 01:11:53.192
You don't know him
like I do.

01:11:53.267 --> 01:11:56.487
I know he's my best chance
at winning that prize money.

01:11:56.813 --> 01:11:58.065
Can you
guarantee me that?

01:11:59.816 --> 01:12:01.568
Yeah, I didn't
think 50,

01:12:01.818 --> 01:12:03.411
Wait.
For what?

01:12:03.653 --> 01:12:05.075
I ain't coming
back to your crew.

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:06.701
Then, just be careful.

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:18.551
Can I talk to you
for a second?

01:12:19.585 --> 01:12:20.586

Whats up?

01:12:36.727 --> 01:12:38.604
Let me take Tina's place.

01:12:38.729 --> 01:12:39.776
Right.

01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:40.903
I mean it.

01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:45.240
I'll come dance with you if
you kick Tina off your crew.

01:12:45.403 --> 01:12:46.871
What changed your mind
all Of a Sudden?

01:12:46.946 --> 01:12:50.041
I know what I'm getting into with you.
Tina doesn't.

01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:53.290
And since when did you become
a teenage crisis counselor?

01:12:53.452 --> 01:12:54.954
You know I'm
a better dancer than her,

01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:57.290
and I can pretty much
guarantee you another win.

01:12:57.373 --> 01:12:59.296
That's true.
There's just one little problem.

01:13:03.754 --> 01:13:05.097
Come here.

01:13:05.631 --> 01:13:06.803
Come close.

01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:14.599
I don't
trust you, witch.

01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:19.153
Ever since you got out ofjuvie,
you've been full of yourself

01:13:19.312 --> 01:13:22.566
and treating me like I'm something
you scraped off your shoe.

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:24.571
But,

01:13:25.151 --> 01:13:27.825
you see that
little girl over there?

01:13:30.323 --> 01:13:33.122
She has stars
in her eyes.

01:13:34.785 --> 01:13:37.664
And I can make her
do anything I want.

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:47.469
You're a jerk.
Do you know that?

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:51.511
You used to like it.

01:14:10.571 --> 01:14:12.164
You tried to fix it,
didn't you?

01:14:12.239 --> 01:14:13.832
You were listening?

01:14:14.241 --> 01:14:15.584
I had to make sure
you were okay.

01:14:15.743 --> 01:14:17.586
Yeah, I'm good.
Ijusi feel bad.

01:14:17.745 --> 01:14:19.247
Tina being with them
is all my fault.

01:14:19.330 --> 01:14:20.377
NO,

But thanks for
trying to protect her.

01:14:25.086 --> 01:14:27.430
I just want the crew to go back
to the way it was, you know?

01:14:28.089 --> 01:14:29.432
I do, too.

01:14:31.425 --> 01:14:34.599
Hey, do me a favor.

01:14:35.429 --> 01:14:39.434
Don't be mad at me anymore,
because I'm too tired to fight.

BRANDON: Yeah, the movie
was good, but real talk,

01:14:50.236 --> 01:14:51.783
could you stop killing
us in rehearsals?

01:14:51.946 --> 01:14:53.323
No, I have to.

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:55.457
We've got to make it
to the finals.

01:14:55.616 --> 01:14:57.914
We got to be
strong enough to win.

You can hang, can't
you, college boy?

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:02.756
Oh, I can hang.
Okay, then.

01:15:03.833 --> 01:15:05.676
So, say my name.

01:15:05.835 --> 01:15:07.087
Okay, say it.

(LAUGHS) Okay, okay! Brandon!

01:15:08.796 --> 01:15:12.801

01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:27.027
Yeah.

01:15:33.154 --> 01:15:35.031
Maria, come here.

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:41.083
Tina, are you okay?
MARIA; Hey, what happened?

01:15:41.454 --> 01:15:42.797
Did Luis do this
to you?

01:15:43.456 --> 01:15:44.582
No, it was his boys.

01:15:44.749 --> 01:15:46.422
They beat you up?
No.

01:15:46.667 --> 01:15:48.590
Luis told them
to walk me home,

01:15:48.669 --> 01:15:51.718
and then they smashed a store
window and told me to grab stuff.

01:15:52.006 --> 01:15:53.178
And did you?

01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:55.013
I WGS 100 SC3l'в‚¬d.

01:15:55.176 --> 01:15:57.349

01:15:57.511 --> 01:15:59.855
I got all cut up.

01:16:00.014 --> 01:16:03.143
I'll take her to my house.
It's okay there.

01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:07.237
Okay.

01:16:07.313 --> 01:16:08.485
Come on.

01:16:09.690 --> 01:16:11.237
Come on.

01:16:17.531 --> 01:16:20.705
I should've listened to you when you
told me to stay away from Luis.

01:16:20.868 --> 01:16:24.998
Yeah, well, sometimes you just
got to learn the hard way.

01:16:25.164 --> 01:16:27.041
Yeah, you're right.

01:16:28.209 --> 01:16:29.677
So, what are you
going to do now?

01:16:30.044 --> 01:16:32.968
I'm not messing with Luis no more.
That's for damn sure.

if we win Battle Zone,

I could go on tour for a year
