WEBVTT

00:00.860 --> 00:02.441
- YOU GOT A TEXT FROM ED BROOKS.

00:02.480 --> 00:05.062
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN TEXTING
EACH OTHER A LOT LATELY.

00:05.100 --> 00:06.613
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' HERE?
- I CALLED YOU FIVE TIMES.

00:06.660 --> 00:08.104
AND I'VE TEXTED YOU.
- THAT'S MY FAULT.

00:08.140 --> 00:09.482
- THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU, PEET!

00:09.520 --> 00:11.340
- JULIA, WE WILL TALK ABOUT THIS
WHEN I GET HOME.

00:11.390 --> 00:14.177
- ARE YOU TAKING THOSE--
THOSE PILLS AGAIN?

00:14.220 --> 00:15.141
- IT'S AN OLD PRESCRIPTION
FROM BEFORE.

00:15.180 --> 00:16.386
I DON'T EVEN NEED IT.

00:16.430 --> 00:17.499
- IT FELT LIKE YOU WERE
HIDING IT FROM ME.

00:17.530 --> 00:18.280
- I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING
FROM YOU.

00:18.320 --> 00:19.833
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- SHE'S FINE.

00:19.880 --> 00:20.562
TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF HER, DUDE.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.568
- [screaming]
RYAN, STOP!

00:22.600 --> 00:24.249
- I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH BOB LITTLE,

00:24.300 --> 00:27.019
AND I CONCEDED THE ELECTION.

00:28.090 --> 00:28.943
[on TV]
TALKING ABOUT THE WIN

00:28.990 --> 00:30.958
OF BOB LI'I'I'LE
OVER KRISTINA BRAVERMAN.

00:30.990 --> 00:32.196
IT WAS A VERY CLOSE RACE.

00:32.230 --> 00:33.959
- YES, IT WAS, MIKE.

00:33.990 --> 00:35.787
[continues indistinctly]

00:35.820 --> 00:38.061
- MMM.

00:38.100 --> 00:39.271
SO GOOD.

00:39.310 --> 00:41.722
THAT'S THE GOOD THING
ABOUT LOSING.

00:41.760 --> 00:43.102
MORE CAKE FOR US.

00:43.140 --> 00:44.368
- KRISTINA.
- WHAT?

00:44.420 --> 00:46.274
WHAT?
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO

00:46.320 --> 00:48.629
KEEP IT TOGETHER.
YOU'RE NOT IN A ROOM

00:48.660 --> 00:50.048
FULL OF CAMPAIGN WORKERS.
IT'S JUST ME.

00:50.080 --> 00:52.002
- HONEY, I'M FINE.
I'M TOTALLY FINE.

00:52.050 --> 00:54.075
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW MUCH
THIS CAMPAIGN WAS--

00:54.120 --> 00:55.280
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
WELL, MAYBE I'M NOT FINE.

00:55.330 --> 00:56.149
I MEAN, I PERSONALLY WOULD LIKE
TO TAKE A SLEDGEHAMMER

00:56.190 --> 00:59.637
TO A BOB LITI'LE CAKE
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

00:59.680 --> 01:00.772
- I MEAN, LOOK.

01:00.810 --> 01:02.607
THAT CAMPAIGN TOOK
A LOT OUT OF ME, HONEY.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.676
I'M EXCITED TO HAVE MY
LIFE BACK, BE WITH THE KIDS.

01:04.710 --> 01:06.098
I GET TO COOK AGAIN.

01:06.130 --> 01:08.405
IT'S FINE. DIG IN.

01:08.440 --> 01:11.500
- CONGRATULATIONS, MA BRAVERMAN.

01:11.550 --> 01:14.201
- EXACTLY, MA BRAVERMAN.
- BOB LITI'LE'S BEING INTERVIEWED

01:14.240 --> 01:15.992
ON THE NEWS AGAIN.
- OKAY, MAX.

01:16.040 --> 01:17.302
WHY DON'T WE TURN THE TV OFF?

01:17.350 --> 01:19.375
- HE CALLED MOM
"A WORTHY OPPONENT"

01:19.420 --> 01:21.172
ON CHANNELS 2, 4, 6 AND 7.
5 DOESN'T GET LOCAL NEWS.

01:21.210 --> 01:22.245
- HEY, BUDDY...
- AND SHE IS.

01:22.280 --> 01:24.214
- IF YOU TURN OFF THE TV,
I'LL GIVE YOU A FORK.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.979
- YOU THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA?
- YEAH, IT'S FINE.

01:26.010 --> 01:27.523
- IT'S A LOT OF SUGAR.
- NO PLATE.

01:27.570 --> 01:29.288
- IT IS NOT UNLIMITED CAKE.
- NO NOTHING.

01:29.330 --> 01:30.729
JUST DIG RIGHT IN.
- OKAY, TAKE IT EASY.

01:30.780 --> 01:32.395
CAN YOU TAKE IT EASY
ON YOUR MOTHER'S FACE, PLEASE?

01:32.430 --> 01:35.183
- DIG RIGHT IN.

01:35.230 --> 01:36.367
HONEY, LOOK HOW CRAZY
THIS LOOKS.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.709
[growling]
I'LL GET YOU, BOB LITTLE!

01:38.750 --> 01:40.911
[cackles]

01:40.960 --> 01:42.928
- [laughs]

01:42.960 --> 01:45.019
OH, YEAH.

01:45.070 --> 01:47.516
- YOU LIKE THAT?
OH, YEAH?

01:47.550 --> 01:48.335

01:48.380 --> 01:51.440

01:51.490 --> 01:53.105

01:53.140 --> 01:54.721
- OH, THERE YOU ARE.
FINALLY!

01:54.760 --> 01:57.240
- HI. MRS. DEITCHMAN, I GOT
YOUR MESSAGES ABOUT THE HEAT.

01:57.280 --> 01:58.451
I'M SO SORRY.

01:58.490 --> 01:59.525
HE'S GONNA BE HERE FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING TO FIX IT.

01:59.560 --> 02:01.448
- FIRST THING IN THE MORNING?
- OH, NO, NO, NO.

02:01.500 --> 02:02.876
- HOW ARE WE GONNA SURVIVE
THE NIGHT?

02:02.910 --> 02:05.561
- UH, UH, EXTRA BLANKET?
[chuckles]

02:05.600 --> 02:07.534
- IT'S FREEZING. WE NEED HEAT.
- I UNDERSTAND.

02:07.570 --> 02:09.777
I MEAN, IT'S CALIFORNIA.
COME ON, GUYS.

02:09.810 --> 02:11.391
WE CAN ALL JUST HUDDLE UP
UNDER A BLANKET.

02:11.440 --> 02:13.089
- I'M FREEZING.
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

02:13.130 --> 02:14.813
- I'M NOT A YOUNG WOMAN ANYMORE.
- SHE'S NOT TAKING US SERIOUSLY.

02:14.850 --> 02:16.294
- I AM TAKING YOU SERIOUSLY.

02:16.340 --> 02:17.295
- I NEED YOU TO LOOK
AT SOMETHING IN MY APARTMENT.

02:17.340 --> 02:18.159
- I KNOW ABOUT THE HEAT, CARL.
- EXCUSE ME.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.644
- IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.
NOW, PLEASE.

02:19.690 --> 02:21.305
- OH, I'M SORRY.
I'VE GOT ANOTHER PROBLEM.

02:21.340 --> 02:23.479
I'M SO SORRY.
- I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.

02:23.520 --> 02:26.375
- PLEASE TELL ME
THAT PIPE HAS NOT BURST.

02:26.420 --> 02:28.445
PLEASE.
WHAT IS GOING WRONG IN HERE?

02:28.490 --> 02:30.583
PLUMBING AGAIN?
- NO PROBLEM IN HERE.

02:30.630 --> 02:33.690
YEAH, THE PROBLEM'S OUT THERE.
- OH.

02:33.730 --> 02:35.174
[laughs]

02:35.220 --> 02:36.835
IT'S WARM IN HERE.

02:36.880 --> 02:38.450
WHY IS IT WARM IN HERE?

02:38.500 --> 02:41.116
- WELL, THE THING IS WE LIVE
TWO BLOCKS FROM A DRUGSTORE,

02:41.160 --> 02:42.297
AND YET IT TAKES A GENIUS
TO GO DOWN THERE

02:42.330 --> 02:45.504
AND BUY A FEW SPACE HEATERS.

02:45.540 --> 02:46.461
- HMM.

02:46.510 --> 02:49.229
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT GENIUS, BUT--

02:49.270 --> 02:51.818
- AND I HAVE WINE

02:51.860 --> 02:54.613
WHICH I GOT AT THE WINE STORE
NEXT TO THE DRUGSTORE.

02:54.650 --> 02:57.232
SAVED YOU
FROM AN ANGRY MOB, AND...

02:57.280 --> 02:59.089
- THAT WAS GENIUS.

02:59.140 --> 03:00.926
- WHY DON'T YOU HAVE
A GLASS WITH ME?

03:00.970 --> 03:01.994
- OH, THAT'S OKAY.

03:02.040 --> 03:03.439
IT'S LATE, BUT THANK YOU.

03:03.490 --> 03:08.006
- OR YOU CAN JUST TALK TO
MRS. DEITCHMAN IN THE HALLWAY.

03:08.040 --> 03:09.598
- MAYBE JUST ONE.

03:19.260 --> 03:21.603
- HEY.

03:21.640 --> 03:23.642
WHAT IF THE KIDS
COME DOWNSTAIRS?

03:23.680 --> 03:24.840
I DON'T WANT THEM TO KNOW
THAT WE'RE FIGHTING.

03:24.890 --> 03:28.929
- I'LL TELL THEM I FELL ASLEEP
WATCHING TV OR SOMETHING.

03:32.970 --> 03:33.959
- OKAY.

03:38.560 --> 03:40.004
JOEL.

03:40.040 --> 03:42.179
BABE,
THIS IS NOT WHAT WE DO.

03:42.220 --> 03:43.073
THIS IS NOT US--

03:43.110 --> 03:46.386
NOT MAKING UP,
SLEEPING ON THE COUCH.

03:50.920 --> 03:54.469
LOOK, I'M REALLY SORRY...

03:54.510 --> 03:57.331
THAT I BARGED IN ON YOU...

03:57.370 --> 03:58.849
AND THAT I SPOKE
TO PEET THAT WAY.

03:58.890 --> 04:01.677
I SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT.

04:01.720 --> 04:04.063
BUT I...

04:04.100 --> 04:07.069
JOEL, I DON'T WANT TO SPEND
THE NIGHT LIKE THIS.

04:07.100 --> 04:08.965
IT SCARES ME.

04:10.940 --> 04:15.388
BABE.

04:15.420 --> 04:18.389
WE HAVE TO TRY TO FIX THIS.

04:18.430 --> 04:20.807
FOR THE KIDS.

04:20.840 --> 04:23.809
FOR US.

04:31.510 --> 04:34.297
- OKAY. WE'LL TRY.

04:34.340 --> 04:36.740
- OKAY.

04:39.240 --> 04:40.207
- I BET MRS. DEITCHMAN

04:40.240 --> 04:41.684
IS STILL WAITING OUT THERE
IN THE HALLWAY.

04:41.720 --> 04:43.164
- POOR GLADYS.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:43.210 --> 04:44.370
SHE'S KIND OF MISTAKING BERKELEY
FOR NAGQU.

04:44.420 --> 04:45.967
[laughs]
- WHERE?

04:46.000 --> 04:48.241
- NAGQU. UH, IT'S IN TIBET.

04:48.280 --> 04:51.101
DID SOME WORK THERE,
AND IT GETS FREEZING,

04:51.150 --> 04:52.936
BUT YOU ADJUST,
AND...YOU ADJUST.

04:52.980 --> 04:53.901
- DO YOU?
"YOU ADJUST,"

04:53.940 --> 04:56.591
SAYS THE MAN
WITH THE TEN SPACE HEATERS.

04:56.640 --> 04:59.734
ADJUSTING TO THE NICE,
COZY, COZY WARMTH.

04:59.780 --> 05:01.805
- IT'S NICE THE WAY
THEY SWIVEL, THOUGH.

05:01.850 --> 05:03.249
[jazz playing]

05:03.300 --> 05:06.121
- YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT...

05:06.160 --> 05:08.367
YOU'RE NO LONGER
MY MOST ANNOYING TENANT.

05:08.410 --> 05:11.811
- NOT POSSIBLE.
- NO, NO.

05:11.860 --> 05:13.304
YOU'VE BEEN DETHRONED
BY MRS. DEITCHMAN.

05:13.340 --> 05:15.717
- THAT'S NOT FAIR.

05:15.760 --> 05:17.648
MRS. DEITCHMAN HAS MULTIPLE
PETS IN A CAT-FREE BUILDING.

05:17.690 --> 05:19.419
- AH, LA, LA, LA...
- YEAH, I TOLD YOU...

05:19.450 --> 05:20.269
- I DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THE CATS.
LA, LA, LA--

05:20.320 --> 05:23.073
- UH-OH.

05:23.110 --> 05:24.998
- OH, YOU'RE KIDDING ME!

05:25.040 --> 05:27.383
- YEAH, IT'S OFFICIAL.

05:27.430 --> 05:28.249
- WHAT?
- YOU'RE A SLUMLORD NOW.

05:28.290 --> 05:30.565
- NO, I HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH THIS.

05:30.600 --> 05:31.942
THIS HAS TO BE
BECAUSE OF THE HEATERS.

05:31.980 --> 05:32.776
- NO.
- THIS HAS GOT TO BE SPECIFIC

05:32.810 --> 05:34.664
TO YOUR APARTMENT.
- I DON'T KNOW

05:34.710 --> 05:36.871
HOW THAT CAN BE POSSIBLE.
- THE WHOLE BUILDING IS NOT OUT.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.535
- LISTEN, JUST KNOCK OFF
10 BUCKS FROM MY RENT,

05:38.570 --> 05:39.389
I'LL GO FLIP THE BREAKER.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.577
- EXCUSE ME,
I'LL FLIP THE BREAKER.

05:40.610 --> 05:42.293
- OKAY, SUPER.
- YEAH.

05:42.340 --> 05:43.227
- GO AHEAD, FLIP THE BREAKER.
- OKAY.

05:43.270 --> 05:46.125
- I MEAN, YOU KNOW
WHERE IT IS, RIGHT?

05:46.170 --> 05:50.789
- I KNOW WHERE THE BREAKER IS
IN THIS APARTMENT.

05:50.830 --> 05:52.969
IT'S, UH...

06:00.360 --> 06:03.284

ALL COME TRUE

06:05.740 --> 06:08.117
MAY YOU ALWAYS DO

06:08.160 --> 06:09.468
AND LET OTHERS DO FOR YOU

06:09.500 --> 06:13.220
MAY YOU BUILD A LADDER
TO THE STARS

06:13.260 --> 06:15.194
AND CLIMB ON EVERY RUNG

06:15.230 --> 06:16.299
AND MAY YOU STAY

06:16.340 --> 06:20.265
FOREVER YOUNG

06:20.310 --> 06:22.574
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE RIGHTEOUS

06:22.620 --> 06:25.202
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE TRUE

06:25.240 --> 06:26.446
MAY YOU ALWAYS KNOW
THE TRUTH

06:26.480 --> 06:29.552
AND SEE THE LIGHTS
SURROUNDING YOU

06:29.590 --> 06:31.558
MAY YOU ALWAYS BE
COURAGEOUS

06:31.590 --> 06:34.479
STAND UPRIGHT
AND BE STRONG

06:34.530 --> 06:36.350
AND MAY YOU STAY

06:36.390 --> 06:39.279
FOREVER YOUNG

06:39.320 --> 06:41.356
MAY YOU STAY

06:41.400 --> 06:44.460

06:48.470 --> 06:50.506

06:58.270 --> 06:59.965
HEY.
- HEY.

07:00.000 --> 07:00.967
- OH, MY GOD, ZACK.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.241
- IT'S OKAY.
YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY.

07:03.280 --> 07:04.622
- I'M FINE, BY THE WAY.

07:04.660 --> 07:06.412
AND MAKE SURE YOU TELL
G.I. WHAT'S-HIS-ASS--

07:06.460 --> 07:07.904
TELL HIM HE COST US A WEEK

07:07.940 --> 07:09.555
- OH, GOD, I'M SORRY.
- A WEEK IN THE STUDIO.

07:09.600 --> 07:10.931
AND THAT'S JUST MY MONEY
GOING TO WASTE.

07:10.980 --> 07:11.799
- I'M SORRY, OLIVER.

07:11.840 --> 07:12.522
- YEAH, APPARENTLY,
YOU CAN'T DRUM

07:12.570 --> 07:14.458
WITHOUT,
YOU KNOW, TWO HANDS.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.946
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
I'M SO SORRY.

07:16.980 --> 07:18.459
- AMBER.
- IT'S OKAY.

07:18.500 --> 07:22.368

07:32.620 --> 07:35.202
- HEY, DREW.
CAN I ASK YOU A LOADED QUESTION?

07:35.240 --> 07:37.105
- YEAH, WHAT'S UP?

07:37.140 --> 07:38.243

07:43.560 --> 07:46.006
SO I KNOW HOW TO DELIVER IT.

07:46.050 --> 07:48.871

MY FRIEND.

07:48.910 --> 07:50.081
WE'RE FRIENDS.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

07:50.120 --> 07:51.803
WHAT'S THE INFORMATION?

07:51.850 --> 07:55.058
- WELL, DUDE, IF SHE'S YOUR
GIRLFRIEND, IT'S NOT GOOD.

07:55.090 --> 07:56.057

07:56.090 --> 07:58.297
SO WHAT'S UP?

07:58.330 --> 07:59.809

07:59.850 --> 08:02.785
I SAW HER MACKIN' ON SOME

08:08.590 --> 08:10.308
OH, DUDE.

08:10.350 --> 08:11.237

I TOLD YOU.

08:12.730 --> 08:14.823

08:22.570 --> 08:24.777
WE'RE KIND OF LIKE FRIENDS

08:24.810 --> 08:26.949
- HMM. NO HARM IN THAT, MAN.

08:26.980 --> 08:29.676

ONE THING.

08:42.100 --> 08:44.136
- OKAY.

08:44.170 --> 08:45.649
- I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND
HOW SERIOUS THIS IS

08:45.690 --> 08:46.964
AND THE CONSEQUENCES,

08:47.000 --> 08:49.173
AND I WILL CLEAR OUT MY DESK
IF I'M FIRED.

08:49.210 --> 08:50.689
I WON'T MAKE A PROBLEM
OUT OF IT OR ANYTHING--

08:50.730 --> 08:51.480
- WE'RE NOT--
WE'RE NOT FIRING YOU.

08:51.530 --> 08:53.316
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT,
THIS IS SERIOUS.

08:53.360 --> 08:55.248
AND WE'RE LUCKY THAT THE BAND
DIDN'T PRESS CHARGES.

08:55.290 --> 08:57.212
- [sighs]
THANK GOD.

08:57.260 --> 08:59.182
THANK YOU, GUYS.
I'M SORRY.

08:59.220 --> 09:01.222
- AMBER, ARE--ARE YOU OKAY?

09:01.260 --> 09:03.114
- I MEAN, YEAH, I'M FINE.

09:03.160 --> 09:07.324
- BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, HAS HE
EVER GO'I'I'EN VIOLENT WITH YOU?

09:07.370 --> 09:09.463
- OH, MY GOD, NO.

09:09.510 --> 09:11.125
- BECAUSE THAT--
- NO, YOU GUYS.

09:11.170 --> 09:13.889
HE'S NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL.

09:13.930 --> 09:14.999
HE WOULD NEVER, EVER DO THAT.

09:15.030 --> 09:16.918
- WE DIDN'T THINK SO, ALL RIGHT?
- NEVER.

09:16.970 --> 09:18.892
- BUT JUST WE'RE SAYING
THAT IF THAT EVER DOES HAPPEN,

09:18.930 --> 09:20.374
YOU HAVE TO TELL US.
- OF COURSE.

09:20.420 --> 09:22.650
- YOU'VE GOT TO PROMISE US.
TELL US, OR YOU TELL YOUR MOM.

09:22.700 --> 09:25.271
- OF COURSE, BUT I--
BUT HE WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

09:25.320 --> 09:27.834
HE'S--HE'S A REALLY GOOD GUY.

09:27.870 --> 09:29.178
- ALL RIGHT, AMBER.
LISTEN, WE LIKE THE GUY.

09:29.220 --> 09:33.179
BUT UNTIL THIS BLOWS OVER,

09:33.220 --> 09:36.849
RYAN DOESN'T COME
TO THE LUNCHEONETTE.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.700
- I UNDERSTAND.
- OKAY.

09:38.750 --> 09:40.126
- DID YOU TELL YOUR MOM
ABOUT IT?

09:40.160 --> 09:43.744
- UM...NOT YET.

09:43.790 --> 09:45.439
- BUT YOU'RE GOING TO.
- YEAH, I WILL, I PROMISE.

09:45.480 --> 09:47.095
- GOOD.

09:49.410 --> 09:51.822
- HEY.

09:51.860 --> 09:52.929
- HEY.

09:52.970 --> 09:54.926
- YOU SERIOUSLY ARE
THE MOST EFFICIENT PERSON

09:54.970 --> 09:57.029
I'VE EVER MET IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.
- NAW, I JUST DIDN'T WANT YOU

09:57.070 --> 09:59.630
TO HAVE TO LOOK AT
ALL THIS JUNK.

09:59.660 --> 10:00.831
- OH, IT'S OKAY.

10:00.870 --> 10:03.691
I'M ACTUALLY FEELIN'
PRETTY GOOD, YOU KNOW?

10:03.740 --> 10:04.240
- YEAH?
- CONSIDERING.

10:04.290 --> 10:07.111
- WELL, I'M PISSED.

10:07.150 --> 10:09.664
IAM.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.086
- YOU KNOW, WE CAME CLOSE

10:11.120 --> 10:13.497
AND OUR MESSAGE GOT OUT THERE,
AND I FEEL LIKE...

10:13.540 --> 10:14.939
- YEAH, YEAH.

10:14.990 --> 10:16.503
- YOU KNOW, WE GOT A LOT
OF ATTENTION FOR EDUCATION.

10:16.540 --> 10:18.360
THAT WAS GOOD.
- BUT WE DIDN'T WIN.

10:18.410 --> 10:19.957
SO--AND YOU KNOW?

10:19.990 --> 10:22.163
I'VE WORKED
FOR SEVERAL CANDIDATES,

10:22.200 --> 10:23.997
AND YOU ALWAYS
WANT YOUR PERSON TO WIN.

10:24.030 --> 10:27.272
BUT THIS ONE STUNG, I SWEAR.

10:27.310 --> 10:31.758
AND IT'S--IT'S THAT YOU WOULD
HAVE MADE AN AMAZING MAYOR.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.449
YOU REALLY WOULD'VE.
- YEAH.

10:33.490 --> 10:35.412
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WOULD HAVE.

10:35.460 --> 10:37.246
I WOULD'VE MADE
A DAMN GOOD MAYOR.

10:37.290 --> 10:39.906
- YOU'D HAVE MADE THE BEST.

10:39.940 --> 10:42.704
- WELL, WHAT ELSE CAN
I HELP YOU WITH?

10:42.740 --> 10:44.287
ANYTHING?
- NOTHING.

10:44.330 --> 10:45.661
I MEAN, I PRETTY MUCH
GOT EVERYTHING.

10:45.710 --> 10:49.055
I GUESS ALL THAT'S LEFT
IS THE HUGGING.

10:49.090 --> 10:52.150
- YEAH.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.816
THANK YOU.

10:54.860 --> 10:56.430
- IT WAS A REAL PLEASURE.

11:00.170 --> 11:02.411
- STOP THE HITTING.
CAN YOU--I'M--

11:02.450 --> 11:03.519
- YOU'RE RIDICULOUS.

11:03.550 --> 11:04.824
- GUYS.
- DAD!

11:04.870 --> 11:06.007
- HEY!
- HI.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.029
- HOW ARE YOU GUYS?
- IT'S PIZZA NIGHT?

11:07.080 --> 11:08.832
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOME
SO EARLY?

11:08.870 --> 11:09.962
- OH, YOU KNOW. I--

11:10.010 --> 11:11.523
- DID YOU QUIT YOUR JOB
LIKE MOM DID?

11:11.560 --> 11:13.073
- NO, BUG, I DIDN'T QUIT MY JOB.

11:13.120 --> 11:16.283
I JUST DECIDED TO COME HOME
A LITTLE EARLY SO WE COULD, UH,

11:16.330 --> 11:17.729
MAKE PIZZA TOGETHER.

11:19.950 --> 11:20.939
both: I DO.
- ALL RIGHT.

11:20.990 --> 11:23.151
HANDS NEED TO BE WASHED FIRST.

11:23.190 --> 11:24.885
THESE SAVAGES.
[kids giggle]

11:24.920 --> 11:28.128
- THIS IS REALLY NICE.

11:28.170 --> 11:29.262
THANK YOU.

11:29.300 --> 11:31.052
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

11:31.100 --> 11:33.159
ALL RIGHT. SO WHAT DO WE
WANT ON THIS THING?

11:33.200 --> 11:35.782
- I WANT CHEESE...
- PINEAPPLE AND TOMATOES.

11:35.830 --> 11:36.990
- AND SOME OF THESE PEPPERS.
- AND THOSE RED THINGS.

11:37.040 --> 11:39.759
- UH, WELL WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO SPLIT IT DOWN THE MIDDLE.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.791
HI-YAH!
[both laugh]

11:41.830 --> 11:43.900
AND THAT'S GONNA BE
A DELICIOUS PIE.

11:43.940 --> 11:45.339
ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS.

11:45.390 --> 11:48.075
- [sighs]

11:48.120 --> 11:49.428
- HEY.

11:49.460 --> 11:51.496
- HI.
UH...

11:51.530 --> 11:52.770
I THOUGHT YOU WERE--

11:52.810 --> 11:53.595
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA BE AT WORK.

11:53.640 --> 11:56.871
- I DIDN'T GO IN.
I CALLED IN SICK.

11:56.920 --> 11:58.672
IT'S PRETTY MUCH TRUE.

11:58.710 --> 11:59.984
I'M--I HAVEN'T EATEN ALL DAY.

12:00.020 --> 12:04.366
I'M GOING CRAZY HERE.

12:04.410 --> 12:06.264
- [sighs]

12:06.310 --> 12:07.686
- I'M WONDERING
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

12:07.720 --> 12:08.948
- I DON'T KNOW.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.231
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU DON'T KNOW?

12:12.280 --> 12:13.178
- I DON'T KNOW.

12:13.210 --> 12:15.269
I HAVEN'T...

12:15.320 --> 12:19.836
[sighs]

12:23.250 --> 12:27.732
I HAD A VERY INTENSE DAY TRYING
TO PICK UP THE PIECES OF THIS.

12:27.780 --> 12:30.635
- I'M SORRY.

12:30.680 --> 12:33.080
- YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN AT WORK ALL DAY

12:33.130 --> 12:38.022
AT MY DREAM JOB THAT I WORKED
REALLY HARD TO GET...

12:38.060 --> 12:41.541
DEFENDING YOU, AND...

12:41.580 --> 12:42.922
YOU KNOW,

12:42.960 --> 12:46.964
WE'RE LOSING MONEY
BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU DID TO ZACK.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.446
HE'S SO MESSED UP,
HE CAN'T EVEN PLAY.

12:52.250 --> 12:54.969
- TELL YOUR UNCLES
I'LL PAY THEM BACK

12:55.010 --> 12:56.113
EVERY PENNY.
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

12:56.150 --> 12:57.310
IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.
- I'LL GO IN THERE AND APOLOGIZE

12:57.360 --> 12:59.180
AND TAKE ALL THE BLAME FOR IT.
- NO, DON'T. YOU CAN'T!

12:59.220 --> 13:01.973
YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE.
THEY DON'T--

13:02.020 --> 13:03.282
THEY DON'T EVEN WANT TO SEE YOU.

13:03.330 --> 13:05.491
THEY DON'T EVEN WANT YOU
TO COME THERE AFTER YOU...

13:12.510 --> 13:15.399
- WHAT ABOUT US?

13:19.930 --> 13:22.137
- I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

13:22.180 --> 13:23.579
- WELL...

13:25.900 --> 13:27.959
I LOVE YOU.

13:28.010 --> 13:29.693
- I LOVE YOU, TOO.

13:29.730 --> 13:31.937
AND...THIS IS THE PROBLEM.

13:31.980 --> 13:32.526
THIS IS THE PROBLEM.

13:32.570 --> 13:35.038
I CAN'T KEEP OVERLOOKING

13:35.090 --> 13:37.183
THE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING
IN THE REAL WORLD

13:37.230 --> 13:38.709
JUST BECAUSE
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

13:38.740 --> 13:40.082
I CAN'T.
- IT'S BEEN PERFECT.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.088
THINGS HAVE BEEN PERFECT.
- THINGS HAVE BEEN PERFECT?

13:42.130 --> 13:43.154
- THEY HAVE BEEN.
- RYAN.

13:43.200 --> 13:43.882
- WHAT?
- YOU KNOW,

13:43.920 --> 13:46.400
YOU DO THIS THING WHERE YOU--

13:46.440 --> 13:48.783
YOU DISCONNECT FROM ME,
AND I--AND I LET IT GO.

13:48.820 --> 13:50.333
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- THE THING WITH THE PILLS.

13:50.380 --> 13:52.371
YOU KNOW, YOU--YOU LIED.

13:52.410 --> 13:53.399
YOU LIED TO MY FACE
ABOUT TAKING THOSE PILLS.

13:53.450 --> 13:55.589
- NO, I DIDN'T.
THERE WAS NOTHING TO SAY...

13:55.620 --> 13:57.679
- YES, YOU DID! YOU DID LIE.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

13:57.730 --> 14:00.722
- WHAT WAS IT, A DOCTOR
GAVE YOU THE PRESCRIPTION,

14:00.770 --> 14:02.317
BUT YOU WEREN'T--
- HE GAVE ME THOSE PILLS,

14:02.350 --> 14:05.558
AND I DON'T WANT TO TAKE THEM.
- SO YOU'RE NOT TAKING THEM.

14:05.600 --> 14:06.931
YOU CAN'T EVEN TELL ME.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.141
YOU DON'T EVEN TRUST ME ENOUGH
TO TELL ME THE TRUTH.

14:09.190 --> 14:10.805
- THE TRUTH--
THE TRUTH IS TH EY'RE--

14:10.850 --> 14:11.669
THEY'RE PILLS THAT ARE--

14:11.710 --> 14:13.530
WERE GIVEN TO ME FOR--
FOR ANXIETY.

14:13.570 --> 14:14.673
I DIDN'T EVEN WANT THEM.

14:14.710 --> 14:15.290
AND I TOOK--
I TOOK TWO TODAY.

14:15.330 --> 14:17.503
- SEE? THIS IS THE THING!

14:17.540 --> 14:19.508
IT'S NOT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT
YOU TAKE THE PILLS!

14:19.540 --> 14:21.189
IT'S ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU
DON'T TRUST ME ENOUGH

14:21.230 --> 14:22.299
TO BE HONEST WITH ME...
- I DO TRUST YOU.

14:22.340 --> 14:24.023
- AND TELL ME!
I'M YOUR PARTNER.

14:24.070 --> 14:26.026
- I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING.
I'M JUST HAVING A HARD TIME!

14:26.070 --> 14:27.276
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
- WELL, SO AM I!

14:27.310 --> 14:29.039
I'M HAVING A HARD TIME,
AND I FEEL ALONE,

14:29.070 --> 14:30.890
BECAUSE I CAN'T FIND YOU!

14:30.930 --> 14:33.000
SO I NEED SOME TIME TO THINK
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

14:33.040 --> 14:34.860
THIS IS GONNA WORK
IN THE REAL WORLD.

14:34.900 --> 14:36.242
PERIOD! OKAY?

14:39.110 --> 14:41.146
- SO THAT'S IT?
I MEAN...

14:57.240 --> 14:58.093
- SARAH.

14:58.130 --> 14:58.994
- HI.
- HEY.

14:59.030 --> 15:01.442
- I WAS JUST COMIN' IN
FROM OUTSIDE.

15:01.480 --> 15:04.233
- REALLY? 'CAUSE IT LOOKED LIKE
YOU WERE GOIN' OUT,

15:04.280 --> 15:06.202
AND THEN YOU SAW ME,
AND YOU WENT BACK IN.

15:06.250 --> 15:08.104
- NO, NO, NO.
1-1--

15:08.140 --> 15:10.449
WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT.

15:10.490 --> 15:12.173
I WAS--I WAS COMING OUT,
AND THEN I FORGOT SOMETHING,

15:12.220 --> 15:16.998
SO I'M JUST GONNA GO BACK INSIDE
AND GET THE THING I FORGOT.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.699
BACK IN,
I'M GONNA COME BACK OUT.

15:18.740 --> 15:20.913
YOU KNOW, IN AND OUT.

15:20.950 --> 15:23.180
- OKAY.
I'M SO GLAD WE CLEARED THAT UP.

15:23.230 --> 15:26.848
- YEAH, SO GOIN' IN.
- YOU'RE GOIN' IN.

15:26.890 --> 15:28.846
- YEAH, DYING FOR COFFEE.

15:28.890 --> 15:30.334
BYE, CARL!
- DO YOU WANT TO HAVE COFFEE

15:30.370 --> 15:31.928
AND TALK--LATER.

15:43.080 --> 15:46.379
- I'M TRYING TO STUDY,
NATALIE.

15:46.420 --> 15:48.729
- I'M BORED.

15:48.770 --> 15:51.568
- WELL, I'M SURE THAT THERE'S
A FRAT PARTY OR SOMETHING

15:51.600 --> 15:53.568
THAT YOU COULD GO TO, SO...

15:53.600 --> 15:55.227
- [laughs]
WHAT?

15:55.260 --> 15:56.568
WHAT WAS THAT COMMENT?

15:56.610 --> 15:58.749
- NOTHING.

16:02.990 --> 16:06.403
DID YOU HAVE FUN THE OTHER NIGHT
AT ZETA GAMMA PI?

16:06.440 --> 16:07.543
WHATEVER THAT WAS.

16:07.580 --> 16:10.788
- OH.

16:10.830 --> 16:12.889
WERE YOU THERE?

16:12.930 --> 16:16.138
- NO. NO, I WAS NOT
AT A FRAT PARTY.

16:16.180 --> 16:18.102
I WAS WATCHING HOUSE HUNTERS
OR SOMETHING WITH THOSE--

16:18.140 --> 16:20.722
THOSE GIRLS DOWN THE HALL.

16:20.770 --> 16:22.909
- DID YOU HOOK UP
WITH ANY OF 'EM?

16:22.940 --> 16:24.316
- NO, WE WERE WATCHING
HOUSE HUNTERS.

16:24.360 --> 16:26.282
- I MEAN, YOU COULD'VE
IF YOU WANTED TO.

16:26.330 --> 16:29.015
LIKE, REALLY.
WOULDN'T BOTHER ME.

16:29.050 --> 16:31.678
- OKAY.
I'M VERY CONFUSED.

16:31.710 --> 16:34.224
I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION
THAT IT WAS JUST US HANGING OUT.

16:34.260 --> 16:37.149
OR HANGING OUT, WHATEVER.

16:37.200 --> 16:39.953
- DREW, YOU'RE SO SWEET.

16:39.990 --> 16:43.300
FRANKLY, SWEET JUST STARTS
TO GET BORING.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.200
- I WASN'T BORED, BUT...
- HEY, COME ON.

16:46.240 --> 16:48.128
I'M OFFERING YOU
NO-STRINGS-ATTACH ED

16:48.170 --> 16:50.730
NONCOMMITTAL SEX HERE.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.035
IT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS COME EARLY.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.310
SO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT.

16:55.350 --> 16:59.389
LET ME KNOW
IF YOU STILL WANT TO BE SWEET.

16:59.430 --> 17:00.829
- ALL RIGHT. WHERE ARE THEY?

17:00.880 --> 17:02.040
RIGHT HERE?
- YEAH.

17:02.090 --> 17:05.537
- ALL RIGHT.
SNUG AS A BUG IN A RUG.

17:05.570 --> 17:07.151
- NIGHT.
- LOVE YOU.

17:07.190 --> 17:09.294
- NIGHT, SWEETIE.
- CAN WE GET A POOL?

17:09.330 --> 17:11.810
- UH, NO.

17:11.850 --> 17:13.294
WE CAN'T.
- HOW COME?

17:13.340 --> 17:15.888
- WELL, BECAUSE
CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE

17:15.930 --> 17:17.477
WOULD MAKE IT
A PAPERWORK NIGHTMARE.

17:17.510 --> 17:18.579
- OH.
- OKAY?

17:18.620 --> 17:20.474
- WELL, CHARLOTTE'S
GETTING A POOL.

17:20.520 --> 17:21.782
SHE'S GOING TO HAVE
TWO HOUSES NOW.

17:21.830 --> 17:23.229
HER MOMMY'S GONNA LIVE IN ONE,

17:23.280 --> 17:24.178
AND HER DAD'S GONNA LIVE
IN THE OTHER.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.758
HER DAD'S HOUSE
IS GONNA HAVE A POOL.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.007
SO CAN WE GO SWIMMING THERE?

17:29.040 --> 17:31.929
- SWEETIE, LET'S--LET'S TALK
ABOUT THIS TOMORROW, ALL RIGHT?

17:31.980 --> 17:33.186
- LOVE YOU.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.494
- SWEET DREAMS.

17:39.190 --> 17:43.058
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA
THAT ED WAS SEPARATING.

17:45.020 --> 17:46.260
- OKAY.

17:46.300 --> 17:50.339
I GOTTA GET VICTOR TO BED.
- OKAY.

17:52.830 --> 17:54.582
- AT LEAST THAT GUY'S
NOT GONNA PRESS CHARGES.

17:54.620 --> 17:55.655
- OH, THERE YOU GO.

17:55.690 --> 17:57.339
THAT'S A GOOD THING.
- YEAH, I GUESS.

17:57.380 --> 17:59.245
I MEAN, IT DOESN'T
CHANGE THE FACT

17:59.280 --> 18:03.319
THAT AMBER STILL SAW ME
LOSE IT ON HIM, YOU KNOW?

18:03.350 --> 18:04.863
I JUST COULDN'T TAKE IT,
ZEEK.

18:04.910 --> 18:07.287
IT WAS LIKE EVERY TIME I CAME
AROUND, HE'S TAUNTING ME.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.049
THEY'RE BAITING ME, YOU KNOW?

18:09.080 --> 18:10.149
AND THEN THEY'RE STANDING THERE

18:10.190 --> 18:11.498
LIKE THEY'VE JUST CREATED
A MIRACLE

18:11.530 --> 18:13.418
BECAUSE TH EY'VE RECORDED
SOME SONG,

18:13.470 --> 18:15.495
LIKE IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING IN THE WORLD.

18:15.540 --> 18:18.293
THAT KID HAS NO IDEA
WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

18:18.330 --> 18:19.888
YOU KNOW?
WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

18:19.920 --> 18:21.228
- YEAH.

18:21.270 --> 18:22.919
YEAH, I REMEMBER
WHEN I GOT BACK.

18:22.960 --> 18:24.746
IT WAS,
UH, ALWAYS FUNNY TO ME

18:24.790 --> 18:28.578
HOW PEOPLE GOT ALL TWISTED UP
ABOUT STUFF THAT DIDN'T MATTER.

18:28.620 --> 18:30.133
WASN'T IMPORTANT.

18:30.170 --> 18:32.343
WELL, YOU KNOW,
WHAT HAPPENED, THOUGH,

18:32.380 --> 18:35.656
WAS IMPORTANT TO AMBER.

18:35.700 --> 18:39.318
- YEAH, I MEAN,
THAT'S THE WORST PART OF IT, I--

18:39.350 --> 18:41.693
I LET HER DOWN,
AND, UH...

18:43.390 --> 18:45.119
I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE SARAH'S RIGHT.

18:45.150 --> 18:47.152
MAYBE I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH
FOR HER.

18:47.190 --> 18:49.329
- WELL, AMBER'S HER BABY.

18:49.360 --> 18:51.942
THERE'S NEVER GONNA BE ANYBODY

18:51.990 --> 18:54.197
THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH
TO MARRY HER BABY.

18:54.230 --> 18:55.640
- YEAH.

18:58.060 --> 19:00.858
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

19:00.890 --> 19:03.518
- I THINK YOU GUYS MADE
THE DECISION TO GET MARRIED.

19:03.550 --> 19:05.723
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING.

19:05.760 --> 19:08.206
I THINK YOU'RE TRYING.
THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.

19:08.250 --> 19:12.243
- GOD, I'M TRYING SO HARD.

19:16.670 --> 19:17.898
AND THAT'S THE THING,
IS, LIKE,

19:17.940 --> 19:20.591
AS MUCH AS I'M TRYING HERE...

19:20.640 --> 19:23.529
IT MAKES ME JUST THINK,
"SCREW IT," YOU KNOW?

19:23.570 --> 19:25.777
SCREW THIS LIFE.
AND THEN I--THEN I GO BACK.

19:25.810 --> 19:27.812
I THINK ABOUT AMBER.
- WAIT, HOLD IT, HOLD IT.

19:27.850 --> 19:29.397
WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?

19:29.440 --> 19:31.852
ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT--
- NO, NO. NO.

19:31.890 --> 19:33.266
NO, I'M SAYING SCREW
THIS CIVILIAN LIFE,

19:49.010 --> 19:52.559
YOU KNOW, ZEEK, I HATED
AFGHANISTAN, YOU KNOW?

19:52.600 --> 19:54.943
I HATED IT.

19:54.980 --> 19:57.039
BUT AT LEAST THERE, EVERYTHING
MAKES SENSE, YOU KNOW?

19:57.090 --> 19:59.365
LIKE EVERYTHING.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.745
EVERYTHING THERE,
LIKE, MATTERED, YOU KNOW?

20:02.780 --> 20:04.293
IT'S IMPORTANT.

20:04.340 --> 20:06.979
AND THEN IT'S LIKE--

20:07.030 --> 20:10.750
I FEEL LIKE I CAN'T GET MY--
MY MIND OFF OF THAT PLACE.

20:10.790 --> 20:12.234
I JUST CAN'T DISCONNECT
FROM OVER THERE, YOU KNOW?

20:12.280 --> 20:15.374
IT'S LIKE I CAN'T--
I CAN'T SHAKE IT.

20:15.420 --> 20:16.136
I JUST FEEL
OUT OF SYNC HERE STILL.

20:16.180 --> 20:17.306
I FEEL--I JUST--

20:17.350 --> 20:19.409
- WELL, YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE TO DECIDE

20:19.450 --> 20:23.216
WHICH WORLD YOU BELONG IN,
SON.

20:23.250 --> 20:26.424
IT'S, UH--IT'S HARD.

20:28.500 --> 20:29.398
- HMM.

20:40.540 --> 20:43.122
- THIS IS SO NICE, HONEY.

20:43.170 --> 20:45.263
- MM-HMM.

20:45.310 --> 20:47.892
- YOU KNOW, JUST THE THREE OF US
AT THE PARK?

20:47.930 --> 20:50.205
WE HAVEN'T DONE THIS IN SO LONG.
- YEAH, IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

20:50.240 --> 20:52.174
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE, NORA?

20:52.210 --> 20:54.417
- THERE SHE GOES.

20:54.460 --> 20:55.347
- WHAT'S IN THERE?
- WHAT ABOUT WORK, THOUGH?

20:55.390 --> 20:57.244
ARE YOU GONNA GET IN TROUBLE?

20:57.290 --> 20:59.042
- I THINK WORK CAN WAIT
FOR FAMILY TIME.

20:59.080 --> 21:00.456
- GOOD.
- YEAH.

21:02.260 --> 21:04.945
- HEY, EXCUSE ME.

21:04.980 --> 21:06.607
I DON'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT THIS.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.323
JUST--AREN'T YOU THAT WOMAN
WHO'S RUNNING FOR MAYOR?

21:10.400 --> 21:13.642
- UM, I'M KRISTINA BRAVERMAN.

21:13.680 --> 21:15.090
YES, I WAS.
- HI. WELL, THIS IS

21:15.130 --> 21:17.542
QUITE THE CELEBRITY SIGHTING
HERE IN OUR LITTLE SANDBOX.

21:17.580 --> 21:19.445
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT, BUT--

21:19.480 --> 21:21.095
- ACTUALLY, THIS IS PERFECT.
THE TIMING.

21:21.140 --> 21:22.516
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS,

21:22.550 --> 21:23.414
BUT OUR SLIDE OVER THERE
HAS BEEN,

21:23.450 --> 21:25.236
LIKE, CRACKED
AND MESSED UP FOREVER.

21:25.280 --> 21:27.441
IT'S GOT DUCT TAPE ON IT.

21:27.490 --> 21:29.276
IT'S REALLY A HAZARD,
AND SO, I MEAN,

21:29.320 --> 21:30.241
WOULD IT BE
TOTALLY UNETHICAL OF ME

21:30.280 --> 21:31.349
TO PROMISE YOU MY VOTE

21:31.390 --> 21:32.789
IF YOU COULD AGREE
TO GET IT FIXED?

21:32.840 --> 21:35.354
MY OLDEST DAUGHTER,
SHE JUST LOVES THE SLIDE, SO...

21:35.390 --> 21:39.349
- OH, WELL, I--THE ELECTION
WAS A COUPLE DAYS AGO,

21:39.400 --> 21:40.424
AND I LOST, SO...

21:40.470 --> 21:42.677
- OH, I'M SORRY.
- IT'S OKAY.

21:42.710 --> 21:44.291
- IT'S AWKWARD.
[laughs]

21:44.330 --> 21:45.570
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

21:45.610 --> 21:47.123
- IT'S OKAY.
IT WAS A CLOSE RACE.

21:47.160 --> 21:48.502
KIND OF A LOW VOTER TURNOUT,
THOUGH.

21:48.540 --> 21:51.543
NOT A LOT OF CONCERNED CITIZENS.

21:51.580 --> 21:52.547
- RIGHT.

21:52.580 --> 21:54.923
UH, SO NOW THAT YOU'VE LOST,

21:54.960 --> 21:57.064
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA--
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

21:57.100 --> 21:58.306
WHAT'S NEXT?

21:58.350 --> 22:00.727
- WE ARE GONNA BUILD SOME
SAND CASTLES WITH OUR DAUGHTER.

22:00.760 --> 22:01.863
- SURE. GOT IT.

22:01.900 --> 22:04.585
WELL, IF YOU COULD DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THE SLIDE,

22:04.630 --> 22:05.654
THAT WOULD--
THAT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT

22:05.700 --> 22:07.349
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
YOUR DAUGHTER COULD GET HURT

22:07.390 --> 22:09.312
ON THAT THING, SO...

22:12.460 --> 22:14.394
- WHAT WAS THAT?
- [laughs] I DON'T KNOW.

22:14.430 --> 22:16.295
- WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO,
DUCT TAPE IT?

22:16.330 --> 22:17.638
- YOU GOT TO FIX THAT SLIDE.

22:17.680 --> 22:18.465
- YOU GOT TO FIX--
SHE HAS TO FIX THAT SLIDE.

22:18.500 --> 22:19.125
- SOMEBODY COULD GET HURT,
OKAY?

22:19.160 --> 22:21.981
IT COULD BE YOUR DAUGHTER.

22:22.030 --> 22:23.577
THIS IS SERIOUS.
- STOP IT.

22:23.610 --> 22:24.884
- THE THING IS THAT I LIKE HER,

22:24.920 --> 22:28.378
BUT SHE'S COMPLETELY OPEN
ABOUT, LIKE, HOOKING UP

22:28.410 --> 22:30.207
WITH OTHER GUYS,
WHICH FEELS VERY WEIRD

22:30.240 --> 22:32.583
SAYING IN FRONT OF THE BABY.

22:32.620 --> 22:34.030
IT'S FINE?
- OH, HOOKING UP?

22:34.070 --> 22:35.105
SHE CAN'T RETAIN ANYTHING.
- THEY DON'T HEAR?

22:35.140 --> 22:36.869
- I DON'T THINK, I HOPE.
- WELL, SHE STILL WANTS

22:36.900 --> 22:38.891
TO HOOK UP WITH ME, THOUGH,
ALSO.

22:38.940 --> 22:40.999
- OOH, THAT'S--
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

22:41.040 --> 22:42.382
- AND IT'S--IT'S--
THIS IS BAD TIMING?

22:42.430 --> 22:43.624
THE BABY AND ALL?
- NO, NO, NO.

22:43.670 --> 22:45.149
I JUST--I HAVE TO BOUNCE.

22:45.190 --> 22:46.179
IF DON'T BOUNCE, SHE'LL WAKE UP,

22:46.220 --> 22:47.323
AND THEN WE CAN'T TALK
ABOUT YOUR GIRL PROBLEM,

22:47.360 --> 22:49.248
WHICH SO FAR DOESN'T REALLY
SOUND LIKE A PROBLEM.

22:49.290 --> 22:50.609
- YEAH, I KNOW.
- YOU DON'T LIKE

22:50.640 --> 22:51.800
HOOKING UP, OR...
- I KNOW.

22:51.850 --> 22:53.738
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

22:53.780 --> 22:54.678
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME.

22:54.710 --> 22:56.462
- WELL, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH YOU.

22:56.510 --> 22:57.989
- YEAH. FOR SURE.
- NO, NO, NO.

22:58.030 --> 22:59.429
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU.
- DO YOU WANT TO HAVE

22:59.480 --> 23:00.879
THIS CONVERSATION OVER A BEER?
I FEEL LIKE--

23:00.930 --> 23:01.817
FIRST OF ALL, AM I ALLOWED
TO GIVE YOU A BEER?

23:01.860 --> 23:03.999
- IT'S, LIKE, 9:00 THOUGH.
- IT'S 9:00?

23:04.030 --> 23:05.964
I'VE BEEN UP SINCE 5:00, SO
IT KINDA FELT LIKE IT WAS NOON.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.444
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

23:07.480 --> 23:09.277
LISTEN, I THINK WHAT'S GOING ON

23:09.310 --> 23:11.824
IS THAT YOU'RE
A ONE-WOMAN GUY.

23:11.870 --> 23:13.553
THAT'S JUST WHO YOU ARE,
YOU KNOW?

23:13.590 --> 23:15.455
- YEAH, I JUST TELL HER THAT?

23:15.490 --> 23:17.003
- NO, NO,
DON'T TELL HER THAT.

23:17.050 --> 23:18.426
I'M IDENTIFYING WHAT TYPE
OF PERSON YOU ARE CURRENTLY,

23:18.460 --> 23:20.451
WHICH IS NOT TO SAY
THAT YOU CAN'T EVOLVE

23:20.500 --> 23:21.285
INTO SOME OTHER TYPE OF PERSON.

23:21.330 --> 23:23.946
LIKE ME.
I USED TO BE LIKE NATALIE,

23:23.980 --> 23:25.675
YOU KNOW, PLAYIN' IT
FAST AND LOOSE,

23:25.710 --> 23:27.871
SPREADIN' IT REAL THIN.
LIBERATED, WHATEVER.

23:27.920 --> 23:30.571
NOW, I HAVE SOMEONE THAT I LOVE
THAT I THINK IS PERFECT,

23:30.610 --> 23:31.645
AND I'M HAPPY AS A CLAM.

23:31.680 --> 23:33.545
SO I CHANGED. RIGHT?

23:33.580 --> 23:34.365
- I MEAN, SHE COULD CHANGE,
I GUESS.

23:34.410 --> 23:36.503
- NO, NO, NO, DREW.

23:36.550 --> 23:39.849
YOU'RE ME IN THIS METAPHOR,
BUT BACKWARDS.

23:39.900 --> 23:41.788
- I DON'T GET IT.
- YOU'RE UPSIDE DOWN.

23:41.830 --> 23:43.513
INVERTED.

23:44.660 --> 23:45.866
- YOU'RE NOT LOOSEY-GOOSEY,

23:45.900 --> 23:47.481
BUT MAYBE YOU'LL LEARN TO--
LISTEN.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.033
OKAY, I'M GONNA LAY IT
OUT THERE,

23:49.080 --> 23:50.559
AND IF YOU TELL YOUR MOTHER
I TOLD YOU THIS,

23:50.600 --> 23:51.908
I'M JUST GONNA DENY IT.

23:51.940 --> 23:52.838
AND THEN IT'S GONNA BE
YOUR WORD AGAINST MINE,

23:52.870 --> 23:54.383
AND I HAVE A LOT MORE HISTORY
WITH HER.

23:54.430 --> 23:55.829
YOU ARE YOUNG.

23:55.880 --> 23:57.734
THIS IS YOUR ONE OPPORTUNITY.

23:57.780 --> 23:59.463
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING?

23:59.500 --> 24:02.014
SLEEP AROUND.
HAVE SOME EXPERIENCES, YOU KNOW?

24:02.060 --> 24:03.197
GET GOOD AT YOUR CRAFT

24:03.230 --> 24:05.460
'CAUSE WHEN IT ENDS,
IT'S GONNA END PERMANENTLY.

24:05.510 --> 24:08.297
YOU HEAR ME?
THE BRAKES DON'T JUST FADE IN.

24:08.340 --> 24:10.399
THEY LOCK UP.

24:10.440 --> 24:11.816
YOU KNOW WHEN THE LAST TIME
I HAD SEX WAS?

24:11.860 --> 24:12.827
- NO.

24:12.860 --> 24:14.407
- DO THE MATH BACKWARDS
FROM THIS ONE.

24:14.450 --> 24:17.305
- OH, YEAH.
- YEAH.

24:17.350 --> 24:19.750
SO YOU FEEL--YOU FEEL BETTER?

24:19.800 --> 24:21.415
- YEAH, I FEEL--ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.690
SO ENJOY YOURSELF.

24:23.730 --> 24:24.970
ENJOY YOUR FREEDOM.

24:25.010 --> 24:26.557
ENJOY YOUR YOUTH.

24:26.600 --> 24:29.592
- [clears throat]
- YEAH, COMIN'.

24:31.880 --> 24:33.359
- WE CAN'T SLEEP TOGETHER AGAIN.

24:33.400 --> 24:35.630
- WELL, HELLO TO YOU TOO.
- HELLO.

24:35.680 --> 24:37.329
WE CAN'T SLEEP TOGETHER AGAIN.

24:37.370 --> 24:39.679
- WAS I OFFERING?
- NO, BUT YOU WILL,

24:39.710 --> 24:41.917
AND I JUST WANT TO CLEAR IT UP
BEFORE IT HAPPENS.

24:41.960 --> 24:43.746
WE CAN'T SLEEP TOGETHER AGAIN.
OKAY?

24:43.790 --> 24:45.121
THANK YOU.
- OKAY. SARAH, WAIT.

24:45.170 --> 24:46.546
HANG ON.
I'M NOT SURE

24:46.580 --> 24:48.992
WHAT'S GOIN' ON HERE,
BUT IT WAS A LOVELY EVENING.

24:49.030 --> 24:50.236
I HAD A LOVELY TIME,

24:50.280 --> 24:53.249
AND I'M NOT SURE WHY YOU'RE
BEING SO GUARDED, BUT--

24:53.280 --> 24:55.248
- I'M--LISTEN.
IT--OKAY, YEAH.

24:55.280 --> 24:57.316
IT WAS A LOVELY EVENING,
OKAY?

24:57.350 --> 24:58.829
BUT I'M 42 YEARS OLD.

24:58.870 --> 25:01.805
I CAN'T JUST BE GOING AROUND
HAVING LOVELY EVENINGS, OKAY?

25:01.840 --> 25:04.320
I NEED TO BE FOCUSING
ON MYSELF AND ON MY CAREER

25:04.360 --> 25:07.045
AN D, YOU KNOW,

25:07.090 --> 25:10.844
YES, SOMEDAY, MAYBE I WILL FIND
A GUY WHO IS AGE-APPROPRIATE,

25:10.880 --> 25:13.462
WHO ISN'T CRAZY, WHO DOESN'T
HAVE SUBSTANCE-ABUSE PROBLEMS,

25:13.510 --> 25:15.398
AND SOCIALLY NOT AWKWARD.

25:15.440 --> 25:18.671
AND YOU'RE SOME OF THOSE THINGS,
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU.

25:18.720 --> 25:19.573
- WELL, GOOD,
'CAUSE I'M AGE APPROPRIATE.

25:19.620 --> 25:21.508
SO I GOT THAT.
- OKAY, WELL, I'M TRYING

25:21.550 --> 25:24.405
TO SET A BOUNDARY,
AND SO HERE IT IS.

25:24.450 --> 25:28.272
RESPECT IT, AN D--OKAY?

25:28.310 --> 25:29.277
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

25:29.320 --> 25:30.309
- OKAY.

25:33.420 --> 25:36.389
- OH, MY GOD

25:36.430 --> 25:38.421
I'VE GONE TOO FAR
[phone chirps]

25:38.460 --> 25:41.395
THE CAUSE WAS MINE

25:41.430 --> 25:44.399
I KNOW

25:44.430 --> 25:45.362
ALL MY FAU LTS

25:45.400 --> 25:48.642
YOU SAW ALL MY FAULTS

25:48.680 --> 25:50.329
DID YOU HEAR _MY CRIES
[phone chirps]

25:50.370 --> 25:53.817
AS YOU WATCHED ME FALL

25:53.860 --> 25:56.476
BUT YOU PAID NO MIND TO MY

25:56.520 --> 25:58.579
I'M JUST TIRED

25:58.620 --> 26:01.180
AND OH

26:01.210 --> 26:05.032
ARE YOU FAITHFUL

26:06.460 --> 26:07.415
[knock at door]

26:07.460 --> 26:08.768
- COME ON IN!

26:10.460 --> 26:12.348
HEY, JULIA.

26:12.390 --> 26:13.288
- HEY.

26:13.330 --> 26:15.491
OH.

26:15.530 --> 26:17.464
- UH, I'M MOVIN' OUT
FOR A WHILE.

26:17.500 --> 26:18.842
[chuckles]

26:18.880 --> 26:20.700
- YEAH, I HEARD.
- COLLEEN THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

26:20.750 --> 26:22.263
EASIER TO SORT THINGS OUT
THIS WAY.

26:22.300 --> 26:24.268
ACTUALLY, I THINK SHE'S MORE
INTERESTED IN SORTING OUT

26:24.300 --> 26:26.188
HOW QUICKLY SHE CAN FIND
A DIVORCE ATTORNEY.

26:26.230 --> 26:26.889
YOU KNOW A GOOD ONE?

26:26.930 --> 26:29.546
SORRY.
THAT'S A BAD JOKE.

26:29.580 --> 26:32.754
I HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN
SLEEPING THIS WEEK.

26:34.620 --> 26:36.861
- ED, UM,

26:36.900 --> 26:40.768
I NEED YOU TO STOP CALLING ME
AND THE EMAILS AND...

26:42.980 --> 26:45.619
- WHAT?
- IT'S JUST--

26:45.670 --> 26:47.319
IT'S INAPPROPRIATE.

26:47.360 --> 26:49.282
IT'S NOT FAIR TO JOEL.

26:49.330 --> 26:54.051
AND TO ME.

26:54.090 --> 26:55.057
- WOW.

26:55.090 --> 26:58.958
YOU CAME HERE IN PERSON
TO TELL ME THAT.

26:58.990 --> 27:02.266
WOW, THAT JUST IS THE CHERRY

27:02.310 --> 27:05.165
ON TOP OF AN AWESOME WEEK.

27:06.340 --> 27:09.036
- ACTUALLY, I WANTED TO ASK YOU
SOMETHING ELSE

27:09.070 --> 27:10.822
THAT I DIDN'T FEEL
I COULD REALLY ASK YOU

27:10.870 --> 27:12.246
OVER THE PHONE.
- SO I CAN'T CALL YOU,

27:12.280 --> 27:16.410
BUT YOU CAN COME OVER HERE
TO ASK ME SOMETHING?

27:16.460 --> 27:18.212
NO, IT'S OKAY.
GO AHEAD.

27:18.250 --> 27:22.698
I'D LOVE TO HEAR
WHAT YOU WANT TO ASK.

27:23.500 --> 27:28.085
- ALL OF THIS?
THIS IS NOT...

27:28.120 --> 27:30.395
MY FAULT, IS IT?

27:30.440 --> 27:32.988
- MY MARRIAGE IS FALLING APART

27:33.030 --> 27:36.295
BECAUSE I LOST WHO I WAS
A LONG TIME AGO.

27:36.340 --> 27:38.376
AND I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT
HOW TO MAKE MYSELF HAPPY.

27:38.410 --> 27:42.198
BUT PRETENDING YOU'RE HAPPY
IS ALMOST WORSE

27:42.240 --> 27:45.277
THAN...BEING MISERABLE.

27:48.420 --> 27:53.073
- I'M SORRY.
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

27:53.110 --> 27:57.114
I'M ACTUALLY OKAY WITH...
BEING MISERABLE FOR A WHILE.

27:57.150 --> 27:59.710
AT LEAST IF YOU'RE HONEST
ABOUT IT,

27:59.740 --> 28:01.879
YOU CAN, YOU KNOW, WALLOW
IN IT A LITTLE BIT.

28:01.920 --> 28:03.148
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

28:03.190 --> 28:06.011
I'M GONNA GO BACK TO MY TINY
LITTLE DIVORCED DAD APARTMENT,

28:06.060 --> 28:08.711
AND I'M GONNA GET
THIS BIG OLD MAN CHAIR

28:08.750 --> 28:09.569
THAT COLLEEN
WOULD NEVER LET ME GET.

28:09.610 --> 28:11.475
I'M GONNA SIT,
AND I'M GONNA WALLOW

28:11.510 --> 28:15.298
IN THE BITTERSWEET MELANCHOLY
OF WAKING UP ONE DAY

28:15.340 --> 28:17.399
AND REALIZING THAT YOUR LIFE
DIDN'T TURN OUT

28:17.450 --> 28:19.372
THE WAY YOU PLANNED.

28:21.560 --> 28:23.448
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU ASKED.

28:23.490 --> 28:26.937
NO, JULIA,
YOU'RE NOT THE REASON

28:26.980 --> 28:29.244
THAT MY MARRIAGE
IS FALLING APART.

28:31.460 --> 28:36.227
- I'M SO SORRY YOU'RE GOING
THROUGH ALL OF THIS.

28:39.640 --> 28:42.529
- IT'LL BE OKAY.

28:42.580 --> 28:45.856
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY TOO.

29:10.400 --> 29:11.424
- JULIA--

29:27.170 --> 29:29.821
- ALL RIGHT, I GAVE
THE BOOTY CALL THING,

29:29.870 --> 29:32.134
WHATEVER WE WANT TO CALL IT,
A CONSIDERATION,

29:32.180 --> 29:34.455
AND I THINK
THAT WE SHOULD DO IT.

29:34.490 --> 29:36.936
OKAY, BUT I WANT TO HAVE RULES,
ALL RIGHT?

29:36.980 --> 29:39.039
- RULES?
- YES.

29:39.080 --> 29:40.524
- I'M PRETTY RULES VIOLATES
THE SPIRIT

29:40.570 --> 29:42.731
OF THE SPONTANEOUS BOOTY CALL.

29:42.780 --> 29:43.769
- OKAY, I NEED RULES.

29:43.810 --> 29:45.084
THEY'RE FOR ME.
- OKAY.

29:45.120 --> 29:46.394
- BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT TO GO
TO SOME FRAT PARTY

29:46.430 --> 29:48.318
AND SEE YOU MAKING OUT
WITH SOME GUY.

29:48.370 --> 29:51.749
IT'D BE VERY AWKWARD.
- OKAY, TRUE.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.781
I HEAR THAT,
BUT WHEN DO YOU EVER GO

29:53.820 --> 29:56.857
TO ANY FRAT PARTY, LIKE, EVER?
- OKAY.

29:56.890 --> 29:58.061
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

29:58.100 --> 29:59.681
THAT WAS RUDE,
BUT WE'LL CONTINUE.

29:59.720 --> 30:00.709
- [laughing]
NO, IT WASN'T RUDE.

30:00.760 --> 30:01.897
IT WAS TRUE.

30:01.930 --> 30:02.999
- FRAT PARTIES
ARE YOUR ZONE, OKAY.

30:03.040 --> 30:05.315
THAT'S WHERE YOU CAN GO DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO.

30:05.350 --> 30:06.726
ALL RIGHT?
- ALL RIGHT, MY ZONE.

30:06.770 --> 30:09.147
- YES.
- SO WHAT'S YOUR ZONE?

30:09.180 --> 30:11.319
- MINE'S...

30:11.360 --> 30:13.976
IT'S TO BE DETERMINED,
ALL RIGHT?

30:14.010 --> 30:16.012
- IT'S SO WEIRD.
- YES, THIS IS VERY WEIRD,

30:16.050 --> 30:19.872
BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU WANTED
THIS FREE-SPIRITED THING,

30:19.920 --> 30:23.390
AND I JUST NEED RULES.

30:25.130 --> 30:28.293
- MAYBE THIS ISN'T A GOOD IDEA.

30:28.340 --> 30:29.193
- MAYBE IT'S NOT.

30:29.240 --> 30:31.640
UM, BUT MAYBE
WE SHOULD JUST TRY IT.

30:31.690 --> 30:35.308
- MAYBE WE SHOULD BE
JUST FRIENDS.

30:36.660 --> 30:38.275
LIKE JUST FRIENDS.

30:38.310 --> 30:40.483
NO BENEFITS.

30:40.520 --> 30:43.557
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.
I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

30:43.600 --> 30:45.522
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT EITHER.

30:45.560 --> 30:47.699
- NO.

30:47.740 --> 30:49.560
- I MEAN, I REALLY LIKE YOU.

30:49.600 --> 30:52.160
AND YOU LIKE ME TOO.

30:52.190 --> 30:54.249
- YEAH, I DO LIKE YOU.

30:56.230 --> 30:59.267
- IT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH?

31:01.510 --> 31:03.785
- I'M REALLY SORRY.

31:03.820 --> 31:05.299
I-I THOUGHT WE WERE
JUST, LIKE...

31:05.340 --> 31:07.444
FOOLING AROUND AND HAVING FUN.

31:07.480 --> 31:09.926
I WASN'T TRYING TO HURT YOU
WITH IT.

31:09.970 --> 31:12.689
IT WASN'T MY INTENTION.

31:12.730 --> 31:14.209
OKAY, I'M GONNA LEAVE.

31:14.250 --> 31:17.413
SO YOU CAN BE FURIOUS
WITH ME IN PRIVATE.

31:18.530 --> 31:21.385
BUT JUST DON'T BE MAD
FOR TOO LONG.

31:21.430 --> 31:24.422
I'D REALLY MISS
BEING YOUR FRIEND.

31:33.060 --> 31:34.948
- [exhales]

31:39.380 --> 31:40.927
- CONTACT HIGH.

31:40.960 --> 31:42.609
WHOO!
- SO COME ON.

31:42.650 --> 31:45.232
HOW MUCH DID
THAT LITTLE CREEP BEAT YOU BY?

31:45.280 --> 31:46.417
- GWEN, I DON'T' WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT.

31:46.450 --> 31:48.338
- COME ON, JUST TELL ME.
- I'M NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT IT.

31:48.380 --> 31:49.790
I'M HERE TO VISIT AND SEE YOU.

31:49.830 --> 31:50.512
- WAS IT A LANDSLIDE?

31:50.560 --> 31:53.313
- I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

31:53.350 --> 31:54.624
- WAS IT MY ONE VOTE?
- IT WAS TWO--TWO POINTS.

31:54.670 --> 31:57.491
- TWO POINTS?
- YES.

31:57.530 --> 31:59.009
- WHAT IS THAT?

31:59.050 --> 32:01.496
- THAT IS 947 VOTES.

32:01.540 --> 32:03.349
- DAMN.
- I KNOW.

32:03.400 --> 32:06.631
- THAT'S LIKE ONE BUILDING
OF PEOPLE.

32:06.680 --> 32:08.602
THAT'S GOT TO HAUNT YOU.

32:08.650 --> 32:10.606
THAT HAS GOT TO KILL.

32:10.650 --> 32:13.232
- STOP IT.
- SORRY.

32:13.270 --> 32:15.500
- IT'S NOT NICE.
- I'M DYING.

32:15.550 --> 32:17.927
IT'S LIKE A HALL PASS
TO BE BLUNT.

32:17.970 --> 32:20.609
PLUS I'M REALLY HIGH.

32:20.660 --> 32:22.628
- [laughs]

32:22.660 --> 32:24.582
DO YOU WANT SOME?

32:24.630 --> 32:25.961
- NO, I'M GOOD.
- COME ON.

32:26.010 --> 32:27.034
- NO. I'M GOOD.
I DON'T WANT ANY--

32:27.080 --> 32:28.035
- ARE YOU SQUARE?
- NO.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.832
- YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT SQUARE.
- I'M NOT--

32:29.870 --> 32:30.689
I USED TO SMOKE
THAT ALL THE TIME.

32:30.740 --> 32:32.389
- YOU SMOKED
'CAUSE YOU HAD CANCER.

32:32.430 --> 32:35.183
- NO, I SMOKED
BECAUSE I LIKED IT.

32:35.220 --> 32:36.539
- OH.
- I LIKED IT.

32:36.570 --> 32:38.424
- WELL, THERE'S
YOUR TWO POINTS RIGHT THERE.

32:38.470 --> 32:40.677
YOU GOT TO GO
AFTER THE STONERS, BABY.

32:40.710 --> 32:43.679
IT'S BERKELEY.
947 STONERS, NOT HARD TO FIND.

32:43.720 --> 32:44.982
- MM-HMM.

32:46.510 --> 32:48.614
- WHAT'S WRONG?

32:48.650 --> 32:50.823
COME ON.
- NOTHING.

32:50.860 --> 32:52.999
- COME ON.
- NOTHING'S WRONG.

32:53.040 --> 32:55.588
- YOU KNOW I'M
JUST RAMBLING, RIGHT?

32:55.620 --> 32:57.440
- I JUST--I FEEL LIKE--
I DON'T KNOW.

32:57.490 --> 32:58.388
HE WENT NEGATIVE.

32:58.420 --> 33:00.934
AND IF I WOULD'VE GONE NEGATIVE,

33:00.970 --> 33:02.619
I THINK THAT WOULD'VE BEEN
THE DIFFERENCE.

33:02.670 --> 33:04.479
YOU KNOW?
IT'S LIKE...

33:06.010 --> 33:07.181
IT DOES HAUNT ME.

33:07.220 --> 33:08.903
I DIDN'T DO IT.

33:08.950 --> 33:09.974
- LISTEN, SO WHAT?

33:10.020 --> 33:11.840
NEXT TIME.
NEXT TIME.

33:11.880 --> 33:13.393
- NEXT TIME.
- IF YOU WANT TO DO IT,

33:13.430 --> 33:14.840
YOU CAN DO IT.

33:14.880 --> 33:16.199
THAT'S THE THING
ABOUT BEATING CANCER.

33:16.230 --> 33:17.219
YOU GET A NEXT TIME.

33:17.270 --> 33:18.532
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

33:18.580 --> 33:20.502
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

33:20.550 --> 33:24.611
I'M JUST SORRY
I WON'T BE AROUND TO SEE IT.

33:35.040 --> 33:38.248
- [scoffs]
YOU'RE SUCH A PUSHY PUSHER.

33:38.290 --> 33:40.565
[laughs]
- THERE'S MY GIRL.

33:40.600 --> 33:43.979
- SO NO CHARGES WERE FILED
OR ANYTHING.

33:44.020 --> 33:46.488
AND EVERYTHING'S--
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

33:46.540 --> 33:48.326
EVERYBODY'S OKAY.

33:48.370 --> 33:51.157
BUT I HAD TO TELL YOU.

33:51.200 --> 33:53.839
I'M SORRY
I DIDN'T TELL YOU BEFORE.

33:53.890 --> 33:55.926
I...

33:55.960 --> 33:57.507
FELT SCARED AND I--

33:57.550 --> 33:59.541
- TO TELL ME?

33:59.580 --> 34:01.855
[laughs]

34:01.900 --> 34:02.855
- I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO--

34:02.900 --> 34:03.685
HOW TO BRING IT UP,

34:03.730 --> 34:05.584
AND I KNEW...

34:05.620 --> 34:07.690
I KNEW THAT YOU'RE--

34:07.730 --> 34:09.891
YOU'RE NERVOUS
ABOUT THINGS WITH RYAN,

34:09.940 --> 34:13.171
AND I--
BUT I NEED YOU TO KNOW

34:13.220 --> 34:15.597
THAT, YOU KNOW,
HE LOVES ME SO MUCH.

34:15.630 --> 34:18.281
AND, THAT BEING SAID,

34:18.330 --> 34:20.150
IF IT IS AT ALL POSSIBLE,

34:20.190 --> 34:24.058
IF WE CAN TRY TO TALK ABOUT IT,

34:24.090 --> 34:27.298
PERSON-TO-PERSON WITH YOU--

34:27.340 --> 34:29.649
NOT, YOU KNOW, AS MY MOM--

34:29.680 --> 34:32.262
I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO GET
YOUR ADVICE ON THIS

34:32.310 --> 34:33.402
AS A PERSON
THAT I TRUST AND RESPECT

34:33.450 --> 34:34.439
BECAUSE IT'S--
- OKAY.

34:34.480 --> 34:38.166
- I NEED A LITTLE HELP.
- OKAY.

34:38.210 --> 34:39.416
- YOU KNOW?

34:39.450 --> 34:42.203
- I'M JUST A PERSON
WHO IS NOT YOUR MOTHER.

34:42.250 --> 34:43.729
- OKAY.
[both giggle]

34:43.770 --> 34:45.283
OKAY.
- AND...

34:45.320 --> 34:47.766
I USED TO WORRY, IN FACT,

34:47.800 --> 34:50.382
THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TROUBLE
FALLING IN LOVE--

34:50.430 --> 34:55.117
LIKE, REALLY FALLING IN LOVE--

34:56.260 --> 34:59.149
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
WE HAVE THIS KIND OF TOUGHNESS.

34:59.200 --> 35:01.987
AND I WOULD SAY

35:02.030 --> 35:06.854
YOU'RE JUST SO...BRAVE

35:06.890 --> 35:11.589
AND SO STRONG.

35:11.620 --> 35:13.679
AND I KNOW THAT,

35:13.730 --> 35:17.518
NO MATTER WHAT,
YOU CAN HANDLE IT.

35:17.560 --> 35:21.382
- [sobs]
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

35:25.290 --> 35:28.327
[sobbing]
WHAT ABOUT AS MY MOM?

35:34.610 --> 35:37.124
- AS YOUR MOM...

35:37.160 --> 35:40.505
I THINK...

35:40.550 --> 35:43.474
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE TOUGH
ENOUGH TO HANDLE IT,

35:43.520 --> 35:46.580
DOESN'T MEAN
IT'S WHAT I WANT FOR YOU.

35:58.530 --> 36:00.703
- HEY.

36:00.740 --> 36:01.593
- HI.

36:03.920 --> 36:07.845
- CAN WE TALK?

36:07.880 --> 36:09.438
- YEAH.

36:22.180 --> 36:23.659
- I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT.

36:23.690 --> 36:27.387
- I HAVE BEEN TOO.
- CAN I GO FIRST?

36:29.220 --> 36:30.733
I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT

36:30.770 --> 36:33.978
ABOUT HOW...

36:34.010 --> 36:37.730
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH.

36:39.880 --> 36:43.668
THINGS THAT I-I CAN'T
EVER IMAGINE OR UNDERSTAND

36:43.710 --> 36:46.679
NO MATTER
HOW MUCH I WANT TO.

36:46.720 --> 36:51.544
I MEAN, WE'RE SO DIFFERENT,
YOU KNOW?

36:51.580 --> 36:52.899
[sobbing] AND IT'S MADE THIS
REALLY HARD.

36:52.930 --> 36:55.649
- AMBER, AMBER--
- NO, LET ME FINISH, PLEASE.

36:58.250 --> 37:00.480
IT'S ALSO...

37:00.520 --> 37:04.149
IT'S ALSO WHAT MAKES US
SO AMAZING TOGETHER.

37:04.180 --> 37:08.799
WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO GROW
AND CHANGE,

37:08.840 --> 37:10.523
TO MAKE EACH OTHER BETTER.

37:10.570 --> 37:14.461
AND WE RESPECT EACH OTHER
ENOUGH TO TRY,

37:14.500 --> 37:17.253
AND THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

37:17.300 --> 37:19.359
WE CAN GET THROUGH ANYTHING
LIKE THAT.

37:19.400 --> 37:23.234
AND--AND I HATE THAT YOU HURT,

- I WANT US TO HAVE A SPECIAL
FAREWELL TO BOB LITTLE.

39:26.810 --> 39:27.970

A FAREWELL.

39:28.020 --> 39:30.397
- - OKAY? AND I WANT YOU TO TELL
HIM HOW YOU FEEL, OKAY?

39:30.430 --> 39:31.533

THE BEST OF LOSING.

39:39.540 --> 39:40.575

39:40.610 --> 39:42.817

39:42.860 --> 39:45.476
FOR DISRESPECTING YOU,
FOR DISRESPECTING OUR FAMILY.

39:45.520 --> 39:46.828

40:00.570 --> 40:01.286
FROM THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU,

40:01.320 --> 40:02.014
