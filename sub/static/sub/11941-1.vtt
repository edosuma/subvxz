<i>It's just around the corner. </i>

00:45.063 --> 00:46.806
Fellas...

00:47.649 --> 00:49.309
...I wanna play a little game.

00:50.026 --> 00:54.190
The name of the game is
"See How They Run. "

00:59.869 --> 01:03.404
<i>It's just around the corner. </i>

01:05.917 --> 01:10.081
Man, you do this shit every time.

01:10.256 --> 01:12.414
It'll take a minute.
I'll be right there.

01:12.591 --> 01:15.343
I own controlling interest...

01:15.511 --> 01:19.924
...of every club in Seven Corners
except for The Kid's.

01:20.224 --> 01:22.216
When I take him over...

01:23.102 --> 01:25.593
...I can bogart the rest of them.

01:25.771 --> 01:28.060
Listen, I know this is gonna
make you angry...

01:28.232 --> 01:30.936
...but I don't make enough money
working at your joint.

01:31.609 --> 01:34.017
Morris offered me a job
at the Pandemonium.

01:34.195 --> 01:35.939
No way.

01:36.782 --> 01:39.783
I'm your baby,
and you gotta take care of me.

01:40.703 --> 01:43.158
Kid, listen to me.

01:43.330 --> 01:47.280
Man, F this noise.

02:00.723 --> 02:03.510
<i>Seven Corners</i>
<i>Two souls fight</i>

02:03.684 --> 02:06.521
<i>One wants money</i>
<i>One wants light</i>

02:06.689 --> 02:09.394
<i>Without peace</i>
<i>Without love</i>

02:09.567 --> 02:12.817
<i>Nothing's ever gonna turn out right</i>

02:13.946 --> 02:17.991
That's the reason why
I wanna play this game...

02:18.159 --> 02:19.618
...to see how they run.

02:19.911 --> 02:23.825
See, we wanna play the same game,
only a little different.

02:31.005 --> 02:32.999
<i>Oh, heaven. </i>

02:33.175 --> 02:36.176
<i>Please tell me why</i>
<i>you've brought me here tonight. </i>

02:40.224 --> 02:43.758
<i>I've always done my best</i>

02:43.936 --> 02:46.261
<i>To stay out of the game</i>

02:48.273 --> 02:50.811
<i>Heaven must be near</i>

02:51.985 --> 02:54.108
<i>Because now I don't feel the same</i>

02:54.279 --> 02:57.066
Man, let's get out of here
before that thing blows!

03:02.955 --> 03:05.528
Guess where you're going.

03:06.500 --> 03:08.706
Nowhere.

03:10.587 --> 03:12.544
Musicians, they're all alike.

03:17.803 --> 03:19.463
You know what your problem is?

03:19.638 --> 03:22.639
You got too many problems,
that's what your problem is.

03:23.183 --> 03:25.970
Just my luck to be stuck with a fool.

03:26.144 --> 03:27.805
Wake up, little baby.

03:27.981 --> 03:31.184
Nothing comes to dreamers but dreams.

03:47.626 --> 03:51.576
<i>With the takeover of The Kid's club,</i>
<i>you're gonna be making more money. </i>

03:51.755 --> 03:55.706
So, fellas, we got to make more money.

03:55.885 --> 03:57.545
That's what time it is.

04:00.932 --> 04:02.806
Jerome.

04:17.449 --> 04:19.240
Damn. Who would do it, man?

04:29.044 --> 04:30.787
Come on, Terry. You can do it.

04:30.962 --> 04:33.251
Come on, brother,
we're depending on you.

04:37.260 --> 04:38.920
What?

04:54.946 --> 04:57.104
Now what time is it?

07:30.982 --> 07:34.682
You want my ID? Okay.
There. It's all right.

07:41.118 --> 07:42.945
Truth, baby. You fine.

07:50.836 --> 07:54.750
I told you to turn this place to ashes.
How come I don't smell no smoke?

07:54.923 --> 07:56.916
We did it.
I don't know what happened.

07:57.092 --> 07:58.372
Like I always say:

07:58.552 --> 08:01.802
If you want something done,
hire good people to do it.

08:11.316 --> 08:14.767
Ladies and gentlemen,
Morris E. Day, the only.

08:14.944 --> 08:17.483
- Yeah.
- Disgusting.

08:29.001 --> 08:31.706
Come here.
Give me that.

08:36.009 --> 08:37.587
Chill.

08:48.396 --> 08:51.018
Yo, Kid. Chill, man.
Morris is coming.

08:58.906 --> 09:01.278
- What's going on?
- Oh, man.

09:01.450 --> 09:03.527
Nice shoes.

09:12.420 --> 09:14.460
The king has arrived.

09:20.553 --> 09:24.136
People tell me you been making
that spiritual noise again.

09:24.307 --> 09:26.679
You know I can't make no money
that way.

09:26.851 --> 09:29.722
If you ever gave it a chance,
one day you would.

09:30.898 --> 09:33.105
I do believe...

09:33.276 --> 09:35.398
...in Billy's will...

09:36.195 --> 09:39.362
...he left half this club to you...

09:39.532 --> 09:43.482
...and the other half to me.

09:43.661 --> 09:47.030
I do believe I have a say
in what music is played here.

09:47.540 --> 09:51.373
- No one man will be ruler.
- Kid, your shit ain't hitting no more!

09:51.628 --> 09:55.163
Why don't you just give me the keys.

09:57.593 --> 09:59.503
Grace, you better wake up!

09:59.679 --> 10:02.550
This music will never change anybody!

10:02.724 --> 10:05.049
Are you listening to me?

10:21.450 --> 10:25.282
- Jerking everything in sight!
- Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

10:27.999 --> 10:31.450
- Are you finished?
- What? I can't hear you.

10:31.794 --> 10:33.704
Release it.

10:33.922 --> 10:35.297
<i>Release it. </i>

10:37.216 --> 10:39.043
Release it.

10:41.054 --> 10:42.797
You got it?

10:43.473 --> 10:46.427
<i>- Release it. </i>
- Got it.

11:00.824 --> 11:02.983
Stella, if you think
I'm afraid of you...

11:03.160 --> 11:06.078
...Grace, if you so much as think
I can't do the do...

11:06.247 --> 11:09.829
...girl, if you dream I came to
jerk around, you better wake up...

11:10.000 --> 11:11.660
...and release it.

12:43.764 --> 12:47.098
- This is embarrassing.
- They dogging us out in our own club.

12:47.268 --> 12:49.261
I told you.
You should've let me rap.

12:49.437 --> 12:52.106
Damn, this is embarrassing.

13:00.115 --> 13:02.785
<i>Go, Morris! Go, Morris! Go, Morris!</i>

13:02.952 --> 13:06.949
<i>Go, Morris! Go, Morris! Go, Morris!</i>

13:20.636 --> 13:23.803
Party's at my place.
Everybody's coming.

13:29.687 --> 13:32.225
Man, you was bad.

13:37.987 --> 13:39.695
You know...

13:41.156 --> 13:45.072
...this plant looks kind of thirsty.

14:29.958 --> 14:31.239
Bang.

15:13.670 --> 15:16.374
<i>It's just around the corner. </i>

16:32.043 --> 16:35.661
It's just around the corner.

16:36.839 --> 16:39.923
It's just around the corner.

16:40.384 --> 16:42.092
No.

17:01.114 --> 17:03.522
<i>Are there really angels?</i>

17:03.867 --> 17:06.488
<i>Or are they just in our mind?</i>

17:07.204 --> 17:09.694
<i>It all comes out in the wash... </i>

17:10.248 --> 17:11.873
<i>... in time. </i>

17:13.794 --> 17:16.545
I swear that little cricket's
getting on my nerves.

17:16.713 --> 17:19.039
Morris, darling,
would you give me change...

17:19.215 --> 17:21.671
...to replace the cape
you ruined last night?

17:21.843 --> 17:26.553
Jerome, please tell this woman
her account's overdrawn at my bank.

17:26.723 --> 17:28.717
Robin, stop asking for so much money.

17:28.893 --> 17:31.895
"Stop asking for money"?
Boy, I own part of this joint!

17:32.064 --> 17:36.014
If it wasn't for my daddy's money,
y'all still be shooting dice at Glam Slam.

17:36.193 --> 17:38.435
- Shit, you got some nerve talking!
- Robin!

17:38.612 --> 17:40.735
Honey, sweetheart.

17:40.906 --> 17:43.194
Baby, please.

17:43.366 --> 17:45.240
See this?

17:46.369 --> 17:48.825
Take a week off and kiss it all.

17:49.622 --> 17:50.903
What's up, man?

17:51.082 --> 17:52.576
Sit down.

17:53.127 --> 17:55.203
- What's up, fellas?
- J.B., Jesse.

17:55.379 --> 17:57.917
Okay, fellas, make a sound.

17:58.424 --> 18:01.590
George is still acting flaky.
The brother's holding out.

18:01.760 --> 18:04.334
- Yeah, we need to bust him.
- What about The Kid?

18:04.513 --> 18:08.427
They're expecting a little crowd tonight.
Won't last. Nobody's drinking.

18:08.601 --> 18:11.804
Yeah, I bet he'd be lucky
if he make 1200.

18:12.146 --> 18:15.764
I swear to God that little cricket's
working my last nerve.

18:15.941 --> 18:17.850
Thank you.

18:19.153 --> 18:21.989
- Fellas, what's up?
- We been losing bad every night.

18:22.157 --> 18:24.315
We're going to George's
to get a new vibe.

18:24.492 --> 18:25.951
I don't know about The Kid.

18:26.119 --> 18:28.610
- He don't look too good.
- He don't pay too good.

18:28.788 --> 18:30.366
- It's $5.
- We need new music.

18:30.540 --> 18:32.948
- Pay up, man.
- Can't do nothing for you, man.

18:55.566 --> 18:57.938
- Hey!
- Hey, you better chill out.

20:41.551 --> 20:42.962
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:43.136 --> 20:46.422
- My name's Aura.
- My name's T.C.

20:46.765 --> 20:48.591
- What's your story?
- I'm a rapper.

20:48.767 --> 20:50.594
I'm waiting on my big break.

20:50.769 --> 20:52.975
What's your story?

20:54.606 --> 20:56.183
It's really quiet tonight.

20:56.358 --> 20:59.940
Yeah, but that don't never stop
The Kid, though.

22:19.360 --> 22:23.144
Wait, wait, wait.
It gets better, man.

23:10.372 --> 23:13.871
<i>In the city of screaming trees</i>

<i>Until that day</i>

23:24.094 --> 23:26.585
<i>I will wait for him</i>

23:28.933 --> 23:32.136
<i>Dear Dad, I met someone. </i>

23:32.311 --> 23:36.604
<i>I've seen her at the Glam Slam a couple</i>
<i>times, but she won't talk to me. </i>

23:36.773 --> 23:40.439
<i>I've got this feeling she's trying</i>
<i>to tell me something, though. </i>

23:40.611 --> 23:43.233
<i>I visited Mom at the nursing home today. </i>

23:43.406 --> 23:45.315
<i>She misses you bad. </i>

23:45.491 --> 23:47.365
<i>Man, why did you leave us?</i>

23:47.535 --> 23:50.204
<i>Nobody wanted the music</i>
<i>you was playing, so what?</i>

23:50.371 --> 23:53.372
<i>I was getting paid. </i>
<i>We could have made it all right. </i>

23:53.624 --> 23:58.287
<i>Yeah. Sometimes I feel cursed</i>
<i>to make the same mistake you made. </i>

24:00.924 --> 24:02.668
- Hey, Kid.
- Yo.

24:02.843 --> 24:06.627
- Tevin's got something to show you.
- Be right up.

26:40.296 --> 26:42.538
Way to go, Tevin.

27:04.447 --> 27:07.946
- Tevin, put that money down.
- Mom, there's a couple of 20s here.

27:09.994 --> 27:11.573
Pick it up. Get it all up.

27:17.544 --> 27:21.127
Yo, Kid. I need a break, man.
When you gonna let me rap?

27:21.298 --> 27:24.833
- Jill.
- Baby, baby, baby.

27:25.010 --> 27:28.296
- Miss Thing.
- Jill. Wait a minute.

27:28.472 --> 27:30.548
Where you been?
When you gonna call me?

27:30.724 --> 27:33.511
- When you get a life.
- Cold.

27:33.686 --> 27:37.814
Yo, Kid. You know good Jill
is working at Morris' now.

27:39.150 --> 27:40.942
Jill.

27:41.361 --> 27:44.611
Morris in the mix now?
What kind of noise is that?

27:48.910 --> 27:50.285
Oh, man!

27:50.787 --> 27:52.365
Man!

28:01.131 --> 28:04.712
<i>Abandoned on the street</i>
<i>At the tender age of 7</i>

28:04.883 --> 28:07.838
<i>How could I ever learn</i>
<i>The real meaning of heaven?</i>

28:08.013 --> 28:12.224
<i>Surely not from a fast-talker</i>
<i>Born to molest a woman's mind</i>

28:12.392 --> 28:16.176
<i>Surely not on the dance floor</i>
<i>Of someone else's idea of a good time</i>

28:16.731 --> 28:21.357
<i>Fate, the only mother</i>
<i>That I've ever really known</i>

28:21.527 --> 28:25.691
<i>Give me the courage</i>
<i>To face the things yet unshown</i>

28:28.576 --> 28:32.905
I've seen her here twice now.
She just sits there and writes.

28:33.080 --> 28:35.868
- What do you think?
- She could be a number three.

28:36.043 --> 28:38.664
- You want me to rap?
- Yes.

28:38.837 --> 28:42.087
I be over here posing
by the Porsche.

28:53.977 --> 28:56.385
Hello, darling.
You must be waiting on a man.

28:56.563 --> 28:59.564
You're much too pretty to wait here.
What's up with that?

28:59.733 --> 29:01.975
What's up with your buddy
holding his stuff?

29:02.152 --> 29:03.980
Does he have to use the bathroom?

29:04.155 --> 29:08.105
No, baby, he's posing by the Porsche.

29:08.284 --> 29:10.360
Cars don't impress me.

29:10.578 --> 29:13.579
That's Morris Day. He'd like to eat...
I mean, meet you.

29:13.748 --> 29:15.207
Oh, yeah?

29:15.375 --> 29:17.451
Punk. Go get him.

29:18.419 --> 29:22.464
- Morris, she wants to meet you.
- Oh, Lord.

29:34.268 --> 29:36.594
- Name?
- Aura.

29:37.981 --> 29:40.935
Lovely. Where'd you get that ass?

29:41.985 --> 29:43.942
Same place you got your manners.

29:45.697 --> 29:48.901
- Jerome, where'd I get my manners?
- Same place as that ass.

29:49.076 --> 29:50.654
- Where was that?
- Mama.

29:50.828 --> 29:54.695
That's right, baby. Your mama.
Now, let's be nice.

29:54.873 --> 29:57.910
It's such a pretty day.

30:05.010 --> 30:06.670
Stop it.

30:10.598 --> 30:12.805
<i>If I can keep him off me long enough... </i>

30:12.976 --> 30:15.930
<i>... he might still be saved. </i>

30:16.980 --> 30:20.479
<i>Heaven, do I really</i>
<i>have to go through with this?</i>

30:20.900 --> 30:23.059
Where are we going?

30:38.544 --> 30:40.003
Look. Check this out.

30:52.183 --> 30:55.387
- You thinking like me?
- I'm thinking like you.

30:55.562 --> 30:58.598
Well. What have we here?

30:58.898 --> 31:02.563
Crowd must be a little light
at y'all's place, huh? Oh, well.

31:03.110 --> 31:07.523
Go get your boss and tell him to come
and see my new bracelet, Aura.

31:09.575 --> 31:12.909
I'm sorry, baby.
Force of habit.

31:13.120 --> 31:14.912
I'm sorry.

31:20.962 --> 31:24.083
Excuse me, boys.

31:25.718 --> 31:27.426
Let's hit it.

31:37.605 --> 31:41.188
- Oh, Morris, can I help you with that?
- No, no.

31:42.110 --> 31:43.936
You know what to do.

31:47.573 --> 31:50.445
Jerome, I think I like her.

32:11.140 --> 32:14.473
Cue the band up for "Love Machine. "
Jill's singing it tonight.

32:14.643 --> 32:16.636
That ought to shake The Kid up a bit.

32:16.812 --> 32:21.440
- Man, you're truly a genius.
- Tell me something I don't already know.

32:22.193 --> 32:25.776
- Kid, you need to come with us.
- Where y'all been? Everybody left.

32:25.947 --> 32:28.733
Making the rounds.
Morris got a hot show tonight.

32:28.907 --> 32:31.315
- We should check it out.
- I ain't interested.

32:31.493 --> 32:33.700
When you see what he's got,
you will be.

32:33.871 --> 32:36.658
- Yeah? What?
- Your future wife, that's what.

32:37.833 --> 32:41.534
- She could turn butter into cream.
- Let's go to Morris' and play.

32:41.712 --> 32:44.879
- We can dog the place out.
- Revenge! Yes.

32:45.049 --> 32:47.505
Besides, somebody's gotta tag
that stella.

32:48.511 --> 32:51.927
- Too fine, huh?
- She's three fine.

32:58.230 --> 32:59.511
So...

33:00.316 --> 33:02.308
...what do you write in your book?

33:02.485 --> 33:05.236
- Poems.
- Poems.

33:05.696 --> 33:07.605
About what?

33:09.200 --> 33:10.824
You...

33:12.286 --> 33:13.947
...and I.

33:14.122 --> 33:16.530
The sky. Everything.

33:28.178 --> 33:31.428
Next two weeks' advance.
I like your style, honey.

33:32.849 --> 33:34.807
Thank you, Mr. Day.

33:35.310 --> 33:39.011
By the way, about my audition,
I worked out something with the band.

33:39.189 --> 33:42.606
- I thought I could just show you.
- Yeah. I already told Jerome.

33:42.777 --> 33:44.057
This is your night...

33:44.237 --> 33:48.104
...band's all ready when you are.
- Really? Okay, thank you.

33:50.410 --> 33:51.952
You know...

33:52.578 --> 33:55.615
...I'm sorry. Maybe I judged you wrong.

33:55.790 --> 33:58.114
It's just that I knew a man like you once.

33:58.292 --> 34:00.450
All he cared about was money
and drawers.

34:00.627 --> 34:03.332
Must have been a musician.

34:04.589 --> 34:06.249
You guessed it.

34:06.842 --> 34:11.005
You know, every night I would kneel
down to say my prayers...

34:11.179 --> 34:13.967
...and he would say,
"You better pray for a strong back...

34:14.141 --> 34:16.300
...because I'm knocking it out tonight,
baby. "

34:18.603 --> 34:20.597
Morris, let me out of...

34:20.982 --> 34:25.976
Still, forever searching
for the spiritual substitute.

34:27.281 --> 34:28.905
For what?

34:30.909 --> 34:32.487
For sex.

34:32.661 --> 34:35.117
By the way, you have a lovely place.

34:35.789 --> 34:39.290
Yes, I have the best music...

34:39.628 --> 34:44.585
...the best dancing girls, and the best
guest any club could have:

34:44.757 --> 34:46.466
<i>It's working. </i>

34:47.052 --> 34:49.887
- Me.
<i>- Shit. </i>

34:52.264 --> 34:55.385
<i>Come on, Aura. Go for it. </i>

34:55.935 --> 34:59.803
Come here.
I'd like to ask you something.

35:00.857 --> 35:03.526
Do you believe in the hereafter?

35:05.196 --> 35:08.031
I'd like for you to read
some of my poems.

35:10.368 --> 35:12.194
<i>You're mine now. </i>

35:15.373 --> 35:18.824
My dear, this afternoon...

35:19.001 --> 35:21.623
...inspiration struck me...

35:22.213 --> 35:24.170
...like a thunderbolt.

35:24.506 --> 35:26.498
And I have composed, in your honor...

35:26.675 --> 35:30.886
...a masterpiece entitled
"The Love Machine. "

35:31.554 --> 35:37.060
Love. There isn't a man alive
who truly understands the word.

35:37.395 --> 35:39.138
I'm a man.

35:39.689 --> 35:42.725
I'm definitely alive.

35:42.900 --> 35:45.901
And I'd love to change your mind.

35:49.240 --> 35:51.731
Like Robin... Hey, lady, where you going?

35:51.909 --> 35:53.653
Tell your boy we're through.

35:53.828 --> 35:55.108
Hey, girl, calm down.

35:55.287 --> 35:58.408
He's trying to put some things together
for the band. Be cool.

35:58.583 --> 36:04.171
Baby, dogs travel in packs of seven.
And you better watch out for this one.

36:05.466 --> 36:07.542
Excuse me.

39:10.032 --> 39:13.199
- Sexiness to the left of you.
- Sexiness to the right.

39:13.369 --> 39:16.239
It's all about the pimp sandwich tonight.

39:19.793 --> 39:21.869
- Two?
- Maybe.

39:22.045 --> 39:24.453
- Two.
- Two.

39:25.256 --> 39:26.537
Let's go.

41:24.504 --> 41:26.331
Pull over, boy.

41:27.757 --> 41:30.426
Man, look. This fool is following us.
Rat patrol.

42:33.410 --> 42:35.237
What time is it?

42:36.997 --> 42:38.491
Jerome.

42:39.499 --> 42:41.159
Throw away my data bank.

42:42.336 --> 42:46.250
- This is a number one.
- What you gonna do, man?

42:47.340 --> 42:49.546
Oh, I'm not gonna take it.

42:50.634 --> 42:55.261
I just want her to go to sleep.
And when she wakes up...

42:56.098 --> 42:59.348
...she'll fall in love with
the first face she sees.

42:59.728 --> 43:03.393
I'll fall in love with
the first face I see.

43:06.360 --> 43:11.698
Jerome, fill up this glass.
Our houseguest is thirsty.

43:13.950 --> 43:16.239
The first face she sees.

43:17.704 --> 43:22.366
Then again, a little kiss won't hurt
the program.

43:29.008 --> 43:32.626
Damn! Jerome, where's the matches?

43:32.804 --> 43:37.964
Morris. What you doing, man?
As if I don't know.

43:38.893 --> 43:41.052
Shit. It's dark in here.

43:41.230 --> 43:45.726
Man, just let me feel her chest one time.
I got to. Come on, man.

43:47.444 --> 43:48.820
Oh, cousin.

43:48.988 --> 43:51.988
You ain't gonna believe this.
She got hair on her chest.

47:57.703 --> 47:59.078
A.

48:01.707 --> 48:03.165
B.

48:04.960 --> 48:06.240
C.

48:08.423 --> 48:09.965
D.

48:25.607 --> 48:27.150
No, baby.

48:30.404 --> 48:31.946
His.

48:42.041 --> 48:43.499
Talk.

48:46.545 --> 48:49.214
What's the matter,
ain't got nothing to say?

49:27.295 --> 49:29.335
You won't ever lose.

49:35.179 --> 49:37.752
You shouldn't get too close to me.

49:41.769 --> 49:44.177
I'm not gonna be here very long.

49:46.816 --> 49:49.520
I don't care if you are the mayor.
I told you...

49:49.694 --> 49:52.612
...I'll give you your money
when I got it to give you.

49:52.781 --> 49:56.115
You just make sure you keep
the police off my block.

49:56.535 --> 50:00.616
- How come you dogged me last night?
- We were talking about business things.

50:00.790 --> 50:02.948
You were talking about the wild thing.

50:03.126 --> 50:04.406
Grace.

50:05.336 --> 50:08.586
George grabbed 19,500 last night,
Morris. We made a killing!

50:08.756 --> 50:11.507
Give me a break on that noise.
I know what he made.

50:11.675 --> 50:16.966
- Just trying to bring you good news.
- Yeah? I didn't rattle your cage, all right?

50:17.139 --> 50:21.468
- Now, where's Jimmy and Terry?
- They'll be here any minute. Just relax.

50:21.643 --> 50:25.641
They're late. Dock them $ 100 each.
And don't tell me to relax, boy!

50:26.274 --> 50:28.646
Y'all think it's easy
running Seven Corners.

50:28.818 --> 50:31.902
I got city officials on my ass
day and night.

50:32.071 --> 50:34.609
The fire marshal, the mayor, everybody!

50:35.116 --> 50:36.990
You're mad because of last night.

50:37.160 --> 50:39.318
That's what I wanna know.
What happened?

50:40.371 --> 50:43.242
It ain't about mad.
It's about discipline.

50:43.666 --> 50:45.374
Listen, cash...

50:45.835 --> 50:47.875
...my family never had anything.

50:48.046 --> 50:50.833
And I intend to keep
what it is I got.

50:51.007 --> 50:54.211
- Understand?
- Yeah, well, you better stop cursing me.

50:57.056 --> 50:58.336
You bad now, huh?

50:59.391 --> 51:00.672
- Yeah.
- Wanna try me?

51:01.060 --> 51:02.684
Come with it.

51:04.688 --> 51:08.022
- Let's go, then.
- All right.

51:27.046 --> 51:29.085
- It's cool.
- Yeah.

51:36.681 --> 51:39.384
Oh, no. That's no fair.
Oh, man.

51:40.934 --> 51:44.718
Now, if you don't mind,
would you go to the bridge...

51:45.230 --> 51:48.017
...find my stella
and buy her some clothes?

51:48.191 --> 51:50.600
I want her to look nice tonight.

51:51.445 --> 51:52.856
Damn.

51:55.783 --> 51:58.321
Ever been inside Morris' club?

51:59.620 --> 52:01.577
It's really nice.

52:02.415 --> 52:06.199
On the outside, it's very nice.

52:06.585 --> 52:09.207
It's the inside I got a problem with.

52:12.425 --> 52:14.382
Who am I to judge?

52:17.179 --> 52:20.181
I still write imaginary letters to my dad.

52:22.394 --> 52:25.679
Guess I'd be pretty freaked
if he returned one, huh?

52:27.816 --> 52:29.441
I don't know.

52:31.611 --> 52:33.485
Maybe that's what I need.

52:34.573 --> 52:36.400
Some kind of sign.

52:38.035 --> 52:42.115
Some kind of green light that says,
"It's okay.

52:42.789 --> 52:45.115
It's okay to continue.

52:46.169 --> 52:48.576
Somebody's up there listening. "

52:56.805 --> 52:58.715
It's hard to see green...

53:02.019 --> 53:04.142
...when there's so much blue.

53:12.945 --> 53:15.900
Hey. Come here.

53:22.206 --> 53:25.657
<i>I'll fall in love with the first face I see. </i>

54:16.220 --> 54:18.711
There's so many things
you don't know about me.

54:18.889 --> 54:21.215
Nothing matters anymore.

54:28.900 --> 54:30.893
Kid, listen.

54:35.239 --> 54:37.363
I'm gonna have to leave you soon.

54:37.534 --> 54:40.701
I told you, nothing matters anymore.

55:35.969 --> 55:37.796
<i>Nobody likes my music. </i>

55:37.971 --> 55:43.179
<i>I told you, don't deal from that place. </i>
<i>Every time you do, you'll lose. </i>

55:43.560 --> 55:45.933
<i>But you lose nothing... </i>

55:46.146 --> 55:48.186
<i>... from believing. </i>

55:52.820 --> 55:54.100
What time is it?

55:54.279 --> 55:57.695
I'm sorry we're late, but you won't
guess who's coming to dinner.

55:57.866 --> 55:59.242
What?

56:08.670 --> 56:10.828
What is your main problem?

56:17.595 --> 56:19.054
I wanna battle tonight.

56:19.222 --> 56:22.887
- Boy, don't you know who I am?
- Let me show him, Morris.

56:23.059 --> 56:24.340
- Oh, Christ.
- No, man.

56:24.519 --> 56:27.354
- Bring him over here.
- Bring that nigga.

56:29.692 --> 56:31.519
You can't battle me, son.

56:33.112 --> 56:36.113
- You're still wet behind the ears.
- Wet behind the ears.

56:36.282 --> 56:39.651
- Psych.
- You still got the price tag on you.

56:40.494 --> 56:42.286
Don't you who I am?

56:42.913 --> 56:44.194
I wrote the book.

56:45.458 --> 56:50.535
I cook young brothers like you
and spit out the seeds.

56:50.713 --> 56:53.418
- I don't need you.
- Tell him.

56:53.591 --> 56:56.342
- I'm the one you need.
- You need.

56:56.510 --> 56:59.263
I took you in when you was
down and out.

56:59.431 --> 57:00.711
Down and out.

57:00.891 --> 57:03.049
I gave you money.

57:03.352 --> 57:05.225
Money.

57:05.395 --> 57:07.851
And now you think you got clout?

57:08.398 --> 57:11.020
You can't battle me, baby.

57:11.693 --> 57:13.235
I'll kick your little ass...

57:13.403 --> 57:16.570
...and have you running home to mama
good and plenty fast.

57:16.740 --> 57:18.115
Tell him where you live.

57:18.325 --> 57:23.236
Oh, and by the way,
when she getting out the nut house?

57:23.413 --> 57:25.537
Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Cuckoo.

57:25.708 --> 57:28.246
You know, I miss them back rubs.

57:33.591 --> 57:35.133
Now, get him out of here.

57:36.552 --> 57:38.130
Morris.

57:39.222 --> 57:42.555
Don't be afraid. Battle me.

57:43.476 --> 57:46.393
You and your crew can whup ours,
you take the club.

57:46.562 --> 57:48.021
Lock, keys and all.

57:48.314 --> 57:51.066
If not, it's mine.

57:53.195 --> 57:54.689
Down?

58:00.828 --> 58:03.401
Down. Now, get out.

58:08.460 --> 58:11.082
- Don't worry about it.
- He's talking stupid.

58:33.653 --> 58:37.402
You did a wonderful job,
and I was thinking that maybe later...

58:39.868 --> 58:41.528
<i>Dear Dad:</i>

58:41.703 --> 58:44.194
<i>I've been trying hard to stay</i>
<i>out of trouble... </i>

58:44.372 --> 58:47.243
<i>... but Morris is starting it up</i>
<i>with me again. </i>

58:48.251 --> 58:50.825
<i>A man can only take so much. </i>

58:51.005 --> 58:55.999
<i>Should I fight him? Or should I</i>
<i>take the easy way out like you did?</i>

58:58.346 --> 59:01.381
Let's do this, let's do this,
let's do this!

59:07.563 --> 59:09.472
Let me see if I can't tune this.

59:15.363 --> 59:17.273
Look out, Monte, here it comes.

59:21.828 --> 59:23.370
So much for round one.

59:23.538 --> 59:26.208
Let's see how good he plays now,
without no gear.

59:30.420 --> 59:34.252
- Let's go, dude.
- Man, ain't playing, my ass!

01:00:08.751 --> 01:00:13.248
<i>Seven Corners</i>
<i>Two souls fight</i>

01:00:13.632 --> 01:00:17.677
<i>One wants money</i>
<i>One wants light</i>

01:00:17.845 --> 01:00:21.130
<i>Child is a spirit neither one can ignore</i>

01:00:21.306 --> 01:00:24.094
<i>Here to show them heaven's door</i>

01:00:25.144 --> 01:00:27.765
<i>Whatever you ask of me... </i>

01:00:28.771 --> 01:00:30.598
<i>... I will do</i>

01:00:34.861 --> 01:00:37.697
All right. Let me hip you to
the rules of the battle.

01:00:37.865 --> 01:00:41.116
We kick our hardest groove.
They kick theirs.

01:00:41.327 --> 01:00:45.159
Last battle ended in a draw,
but this time it's for the Glam Slam.

01:00:45.331 --> 01:00:47.241
We're gonna kill him!

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:50.454
Running down deep,
I know there's good in Morris.

01:00:52.922 --> 01:00:54.582
I can make him stop.

01:00:55.967 --> 01:00:57.758
Never.

01:00:59.804 --> 01:01:01.713
Whatever it takes...

01:01:02.932 --> 01:01:04.308
...I'll make him stop.

01:01:09.982 --> 01:01:13.814
It's my time. And I say shake!

01:08:28.144 --> 01:08:31.098
Whoever battles me,
you better bring an army.

01:08:31.604 --> 01:08:34.227
Better bring an army,
sure enough.

01:08:39.656 --> 01:08:43.736
Damn! I told you we should've
played a different song.

01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:46.198
Kid's gonna lose, man.

01:08:46.955 --> 01:08:49.529
<i>Heaven, what shall I do now?</i>

01:08:53.587 --> 01:08:55.496
<i>I'm losing him. </i>

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:16.269
Hey, Mom!

01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:22.439
Kid! Don't, baby! Come back!

01:09:37.423 --> 01:09:39.795
<i>Whatever you ask of me... </i>

01:09:40.885 --> 01:09:42.759
<i>... I will do. </i>

01:09:54.858 --> 01:09:56.851
I want you to have this.

01:09:57.403 --> 01:10:00.025
My poems are like my children.

01:10:00.532 --> 01:10:03.533
One day, this one's gonna
make his mama proud.

01:10:03.827 --> 01:10:05.700
Aren't you, baby?

01:10:06.579 --> 01:10:08.371
Yes, Mommy.

01:10:12.669 --> 01:10:14.875
Wanna see where I write?

01:10:16.172 --> 01:10:19.126
Yeah. Sure.

01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:25.888
This way.

01:10:43.576 --> 01:10:46.327
Kid, you can't fight fire with fire.

01:10:46.579 --> 01:10:50.077
When a man screams,
you must learn to whisper.

01:10:53.251 --> 01:10:54.580
You're gonna win, Kid.

01:10:55.421 --> 01:10:57.295
Don't give up.

01:10:59.008 --> 01:11:01.166
Don't ever give up.

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:18.520
The Time is taking over the Glam Slam!
You better come get your stuff, man!

01:11:25.787 --> 01:11:28.788
Come on in, Tevin.
It's getting ready to storm again.

01:11:28.956 --> 01:11:30.499
All right, Mom.

01:11:31.626 --> 01:11:34.580
You love to stay out late at night,
don't you?

01:11:48.976 --> 01:11:50.258
Damn!

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:53.971
I didn't even get a chance to rap.

01:12:05.119 --> 01:12:06.945
<i>"To whom it may concern. </i>

01:12:07.121 --> 01:12:10.454
<i>All income derived from</i>
<i>the following accounts:</i>

01:12:10.624 --> 01:12:15.120
Clinton Club, Melody Cool,
Glam Slam...

01:12:15.295 --> 01:12:19.079
...will be payable directly to me. "

01:12:24.096 --> 01:12:27.928
What's up with this half-and-half bitch?
Am I number one or number two?

01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:30.769
Tell me now
because I really don't need this shit!

01:12:30.936 --> 01:12:32.893
Put some treble on that tone...

01:12:33.063 --> 01:12:36.646
...or you gonna be pulling some
Stacy Adams out your ass!

01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:41.359
Now, you know I'm the baddest.

01:12:45.702 --> 01:12:47.908
Who's built the best?

01:12:51.041 --> 01:12:52.700
Damn.

01:13:31.917 --> 01:13:35.784
We'll be right back
after a commercial break.

01:13:40.592 --> 01:13:43.345
You hit Melody.
The rest of us will bogart George.

01:13:43.513 --> 01:13:44.793
- Fellas.
- Yeah!

01:13:44.971 --> 01:13:46.252
- Let's do it.
- Yo!

01:13:48.350 --> 01:13:51.517
All we got to do
is have George sign the deed.

01:13:51.686 --> 01:13:55.138
- Then we out of here.
- Oh, he'll sign it, one way or another.

01:13:55.982 --> 01:13:58.473
Listen, let me give you
a piece of good advice!

01:13:58.652 --> 01:14:00.479
And I do get paid for counseling.

01:14:00.654 --> 01:14:03.774
Sign the club over, Melody,
or we'll wreck you too.

01:14:03.949 --> 01:14:08.112
Who are you, walking around
telling everybody what to do?

01:14:08.286 --> 01:14:11.205
I've been laying low,
respecting Billy's dying wishes.

01:14:11.374 --> 01:14:13.781
But when you start
bogarting me and George...

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:17.163
...you mess with the food on our dishes.
- Ain't that a shame.

01:14:23.052 --> 01:14:25.590
All right, Melody's getting ready to rap!

01:14:25.763 --> 01:14:29.513
I've seen many bridges in my time
and crossed every one of them...

01:14:29.685 --> 01:14:31.891
...with no trouble at all.

01:14:35.107 --> 01:14:37.943
I had trials and tribulations,
heartaches and pains.

01:14:38.194 --> 01:14:41.480
- Well, that's all right.
- Survived them all, baby.

01:14:42.031 --> 01:14:44.867
I'm still Melody. And I'm still cool.

01:16:37.985 --> 01:16:40.558
- Go, get out of here.
- Grab him.

01:16:40.738 --> 01:16:43.607
- Get back!
- I'll hold him. I'll hold him. I got him.

01:17:12.019 --> 01:17:13.846
George! Don't!

01:17:15.105 --> 01:17:16.386
Don't do it, man.

01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:23.146
- Hey!
- Get him! He's got the deed, man!

01:17:23.322 --> 01:17:25.150
Go after him, man!

01:17:28.536 --> 01:17:30.280
Don't give up.

01:17:33.626 --> 01:17:35.914
You won't ever lose.

01:17:42.468 --> 01:17:45.385
<i>Whatever you ask of me, I will do. </i>

01:17:46.847 --> 01:17:49.718
Man! Oh, shit!

01:17:54.064 --> 01:17:55.641
No!

01:18:07.953 --> 01:18:09.233
Who got hit?

01:18:11.831 --> 01:18:15.413
- What happened?
- Somebody get an ambulance!

01:18:15.584 --> 01:18:17.542
It's right down the street.

01:18:20.214 --> 01:18:22.172
All right. Okay.

01:18:23.218 --> 01:18:27.216
- I never saw her. Damn.
- I got him. I got him.

01:18:27.597 --> 01:18:29.839
Robin, go see.

01:19:10.017 --> 01:19:12.590
I have just one question for you.

01:19:12.978 --> 01:19:14.722
I'm listening.

01:19:15.272 --> 01:19:17.266
How do you wanna die?

01:19:19.486 --> 01:19:23.353
<i>When a man screams,</i>
<i>you must learn to whisper. </i>

01:19:40.923 --> 01:19:44.293
<i>It's just around the corner. </i>

01:19:50.475 --> 01:19:55.682
<i>I told you, don't deal from that place. </i>
<i>Every time you do, you'll lose. </i>

01:20:04.697 --> 01:20:07.023
<i>But you lose nothing... </i>

01:20:07.325 --> 01:20:09.033
<i>... from believing. </i>

01:20:10.995 --> 01:20:12.870
<i>You're gonna win, Kid. </i>

01:20:14.083 --> 01:20:15.992
<i>Don't give up. </i>

01:20:16.502 --> 01:20:18.162
Don't ever give up.

01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:25.189
Just let him have the club, Morris.

01:22:29.140 --> 01:22:31.013
Go see what's up.

01:25:29.786 --> 01:25:33.200
Man, can you believe it?
The Kid won.

01:25:33.371 --> 01:25:36.740
And with a ballad. Damn!

01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:57.678
<i>Are there really angels?</i>

01:25:58.147 --> 01:26:00.555
<i>Or are they just in our mind?</i>

01:26:01.567 --> 01:26:03.774
<i>It all comes out in the wash... </i>

01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:06.194
<i>... in time. </i>

01:26:29.346 --> 01:26:32.133
One, two, three!

01:26:39.106 --> 01:26:41.513
Oh, man, my skillet!

01:26:42.443 --> 01:26:45.279
- I'm gonna blast somebody!
- No, you don't.

01:26:47.199 --> 01:26:48.741
Just let me...

01:26:49.243 --> 01:26:53.988
Come on, baby. Robin's got something
that'll take your mind off all that.

01:26:54.665 --> 01:26:56.990
But my skillet!
Somebody painted my skillet!

01:26:57.168 --> 01:26:59.456
Come on upstairs.

01:28:20.379 --> 01:28:23.962
Morris, turn off the light.
