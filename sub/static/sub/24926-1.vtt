01:29.600 --> 01:31.034
In the beginning,

01:32.880 --> 01:36.396
Hashem made
three types of creatures,

01:36.960 --> 01:38.189
the angels,

01:38.960 --> 01:40.155
the beasts,

01:42.280 --> 01:44.476
and the human beings.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.596
The angels, He made
from His pure word.

01:51.920 --> 01:54.640
The angels have
no will to do evil.

01:54.880 --> 01:59.079
They cannot deviate for one
moment from His purpose.

02:01.200 --> 02:04.432
The beasts have only their
instincts to guide them.

02:04.560 --> 02:08.348
They, too,
follow the commands of their maker.

02:09.720 --> 02:10.995
The Torah states

02:11.800 --> 02:17.080
that Hashem spent almost
six whole days of creation

02:17.160 --> 02:18.992
fashioning these creatures.

02:19.080 --> 02:22.312
Then, just before sunset,

02:22.880 --> 02:25.156
He took a small
quantity of earth

02:25.240 --> 02:30.793
and from it He fashioned
man and woman.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.560
An afterthought?

02:37.840 --> 02:40.036
Or His crowning achievement?

02:42.440 --> 02:43.954
So, what is this thing?

02:45.200 --> 02:46.190
Man?

02:47.200 --> 02:48.190
Woman?

02:50.600 --> 02:54.037
It is a being with
the power to disobey.

02:54.760 --> 02:57.514
Alone among
all the creatures

02:57.600 --> 02:59.159
we have free will.

03:01.040 --> 03:03.157
We hang suspended

03:03.240 --> 03:04.959
between the clarity
of the angels

03:05.080 --> 03:06.878
and the desires
of the beasts.

03:07.280 --> 03:10.990
Hashem gave us choice,
which is both a privilege and a burden.

03:11.080 --> 03:13.151
We must then choose

03:14.080 --> 03:15.958
the tangled life

03:17.200 --> 03:18.190
we live.

03:27.600 --> 03:28.716
Call an ambulance.

03:30.360 --> 03:31.350
Rav.

03:32.280 --> 03:33.270
Rav.

03:33.960 --> 03:34.950
Open your eyes.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.516
Take a breath.

03:49.800 --> 03:55.717
And so you were 15 when you first...
First got a tattoo?

03:55.800 --> 03:57.075
That one really hurt.

03:57.160 --> 04:00.517
That one hurt,
and it was Jesus there.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.719
- Jesus really hurt.
- Mmm-hmm.

04:05.440 --> 04:06.669
It's lovely.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.400
Are you getting
what you need?

04:12.240 --> 04:15.199
This is fantastic, yeah.
Thank you. Are you all right?

04:15.800 --> 04:17.279
I'll need a smoke
in a bit.

04:17.640 --> 04:18.755
Mmm-hmm.
Five more minutes?

04:20.839 --> 04:23.036
I got it.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.195
Mmm-hmm.

04:27.640 --> 04:29.518
Chin down a little bit.

04:36.520 --> 04:38.637
That's lovely when
you smile a little bit.

04:40.240 --> 04:41.913
- Ronnie.
- Not now.

04:44.520 --> 04:45.510
Ronnie.

04:46.960 --> 04:48.155
You need to speak
to this man.

07:52.120 --> 07:53.190
Hello there.

07:53.760 --> 07:55.399
- Yes.
- Is Dovid here?

07:55.480 --> 07:56.994
- Yes.
- Thank you.

08:00.240 --> 08:02.197
Rabbi, there's
someone here to see you.

08:04.240 --> 08:06.038
- Who is it?
- She didn't say.

08:06.480 --> 08:07.675
Thanks, Naomi.

08:13.720 --> 08:14.949
Dovid.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.355
Ronit.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.399
Ronit.

08:21.520 --> 08:22.954
We weren't expecting you.

08:25.960 --> 08:27.599
No?

08:30.320 --> 08:32.390
- I thought...
- May you live a long life.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.080
Thank you.

08:36.200 --> 08:37.520
I'm sorry, I forgot.

08:40.440 --> 08:42.193
Did you come straight
from the airport?

08:43.000 --> 08:43.990
Yeah.

08:44.720 --> 08:46.677
Yeah, I'll go to a hotel.

08:48.440 --> 08:52.275
There's people here
to honor the Rav.

08:53.600 --> 08:54.590
Right.

08:55.840 --> 08:56.830
You okay?

08:59.920 --> 09:00.910
Yeah.

09:02.600 --> 09:03.795
How did he die?

09:05.040 --> 09:07.316
Pneumonia, finally.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.399
I'll just find a place
to put these.

09:12.480 --> 09:13.914
- Take this.
- I'll be back.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.320
- Right.
- Thank you.

09:15.600 --> 09:16.590
Yeah.

09:30.120 --> 09:31.110
Hello.

09:41.000 --> 09:41.990
Hello.

10:07.600 --> 10:08.590
Ronit.

10:09.080 --> 10:10.878
- Fruma?
- It's really you!

10:11.560 --> 10:12.835
Moshe.

10:12.920 --> 10:15.799
Ronit, you're here.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.478
Of course you're here.

10:18.840 --> 10:20.797
Oh.
Hello.

10:20.880 --> 10:21.996
Fruma.

10:24.280 --> 10:25.270
Ronit.

10:26.280 --> 10:27.270
Uncle Hartog.

10:28.800 --> 10:29.870
How are you?

10:31.120 --> 10:32.156
I'm all right.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.475
May you live a long life.

10:37.800 --> 10:39.996
Yeah. Take your coat off.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.113
Come on, and the scarf...

10:42.200 --> 10:43.919
- No, I'm keeping this.
- And the gloves.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.036
Fruma.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.190
So,

10:49.560 --> 10:50.710
you came.

11:06.960 --> 11:08.030
Are you all right?

11:08.840 --> 11:10.035
Have you
got any coffee?

11:12.080 --> 11:13.594
- Can I have some?
- Come.

11:24.440 --> 11:26.432
Do you still take it black?
- Yeah, thanks.

11:32.720 --> 11:34.120
I'll get a cab in a bit.

11:37.880 --> 11:39.792
Stay here, Ronit.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.592
Oh, no, that's all right.
Thank you.

11:42.720 --> 11:43.710
Stay here.

11:44.760 --> 11:45.750
Really?

11:48.440 --> 11:49.430
Thanks.

11:53.200 --> 11:54.395
Hmm.

11:56.240 --> 11:57.640
So you came to...

11:59.520 --> 12:00.510
To mourn the Rav.

12:01.400 --> 12:02.880
Why else would I be here?

12:02.960 --> 12:04.917
You were never
very predictable.

12:05.680 --> 12:07.592
Are you still
angry with me?

12:07.680 --> 12:09.319
You left very suddenly.

12:26.800 --> 12:27.836
You married?

12:28.600 --> 12:29.875
Mmm.

12:30.640 --> 12:31.915
When did that happen?

12:34.520 --> 12:35.510
A while ago.

12:38.360 --> 12:41.512
Say more. Who is she?
Do I know her?

12:41.640 --> 12:43.313
Oh, God, it's
not Hinda, is it?

12:43.800 --> 12:48.920
Dovid, you didn't marry
Hinda of Hendon, did you?

12:50.840 --> 12:54.197
Oh, you did. You did, you married Hinda.
Oh, shit, Dovid, no.

12:54.280 --> 12:55.509
No.

12:57.040 --> 12:59.236
- No, I didn't marry Hinda.
- Well, that's good.

13:01.080 --> 13:04.278
Although that does leave about 20
women out there identical to Hinda.

13:04.360 --> 13:06.113
- Why are they all exactly the same?
- Don't be cruel.

13:14.240 --> 13:15.310
Hello, Esti.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.954
Ronit. How are you?

13:20.520 --> 13:23.274
I'm, um,

13:24.360 --> 13:27.717
- here, which is strange.
- Mmm-hmm.

13:27.960 --> 13:28.950
How are you?

13:30.360 --> 13:31.840
Uh, may you live
a long life.

13:32.960 --> 13:34.030
Thank you.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.478
You look very, uh,

13:39.280 --> 13:40.873
- New York.
- Well...

13:42.800 --> 13:45.793
Goodness, you look
very frum, Esti.

13:49.720 --> 13:51.040
Shall I take
more food out?

13:51.120 --> 13:53.555
Don't, leave it, let's talk.
Why doesn't

13:54.400 --> 13:57.711
- Dovid's wife do it?
- When she appears.

13:58.200 --> 14:01.238
So who is
Mrs. Kuperman, Esti?

14:01.640 --> 14:03.313
Do we approve?

14:04.280 --> 14:06.875
Ronit was going
to go to a hotel,

14:06.960 --> 14:08.997
but I told her she
should stay with us.

14:11.480 --> 14:14.200
Ah, yes, yes. You must.

14:16.040 --> 14:18.635
Yeah, I'll fold down the bed
in the spare room.

14:18.720 --> 14:21.110
I'll do it. I'll do it.
It's fine.

14:21.240 --> 14:22.515
You're married.

14:23.640 --> 14:24.630
Yes.

14:27.520 --> 14:28.840
Yes we are, Ronit.

14:28.920 --> 14:30.070
Nobody told me.

14:30.960 --> 14:32.235
Why didn't you
let me know?

14:34.560 --> 14:36.040
You disappeared.

14:42.480 --> 14:43.470
Wow.

14:45.120 --> 14:46.270
Okay.

14:47.360 --> 14:48.760
Congratulations.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.593
No, no,
please. Please.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.190
- Come.
- Okay.

15:17.160 --> 15:19.959
The Hesped is going
to be a big event.

15:20.600 --> 15:22.273
You and Esti
got married?

15:24.160 --> 15:25.594
It was always
the three of us.

15:25.680 --> 15:26.909
Yeah, you went away.

15:27.600 --> 15:28.829
Left the two of us.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.397
Well, I would have come over,
if you'd told me he was ill.

15:31.480 --> 15:33.312
The Rav didn't
want you to know.

15:38.160 --> 15:41.153
He became very frail at the end.
He probably

15:43.120 --> 15:45.589
didn't want you
to see him like that.

15:46.480 --> 15:47.709
You still should
have called me.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.876
This week has been
harsh, Ronit.

15:55.520 --> 15:57.113
Hmm? Please?

15:57.320 --> 15:58.834
My father just died.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.036
I know.

16:04.400 --> 16:05.550
I know, I was there.

16:07.120 --> 16:08.110
Well,

16:08.880 --> 16:10.678
at least you let me know
he was dead.

16:14.960 --> 16:18.556
It's important that this week
is conducted with honor.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.270
Honor?

16:23.200 --> 16:24.680
It's the most
important thing.

16:26.480 --> 16:27.470
Of course it is.

17:57.040 --> 17:59.157
Sorry, it's
a bit of a mess.

18:07.960 --> 18:09.997
- I'll get you some hangers.
- - Thanks.

18:25.160 --> 18:26.150
What?

18:28.520 --> 18:29.556
I look older?

18:29.640 --> 18:31.359
- I wasn't thinking that.
- Mmm.

18:35.600 --> 18:37.353
I look tired.

18:38.040 --> 18:39.235
We all do.

18:39.320 --> 18:41.118
Esti, do you think
I should stay somewhere else?

18:43.480 --> 18:44.596
Do what you want.

18:46.360 --> 18:47.589
Do the windows open?

18:47.680 --> 18:48.670
No.

18:49.320 --> 18:52.392
Uh, if you want to smoke
you need to go downstairs.

19:19.720 --> 19:20.710
Here.

19:21.520 --> 19:23.318
I brought you
an extra blanket.

19:24.240 --> 19:26.436
"Rav Krushka's
untimely death

19:26.560 --> 19:29.359
"is a crushing blow
to Anglo-Jewry.

19:29.480 --> 19:31.039
"He was a giant of the faith.

19:31.120 --> 19:34.033
"Sadly, he left
no children."

19:37.440 --> 19:38.635
Lazy journalism.

19:40.040 --> 19:42.475
- That would have upset the Rav.
- Childless.

19:43.040 --> 19:46.078
It was probably written
by some 12-year-old reporter.

19:46.840 --> 19:47.830
Forget about it.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.593
Everybody loves him
so much.

19:53.200 --> 19:56.352
I used to wonder if I loved him as
much as all those strangers did.

19:56.440 --> 20:00.116
Sometimes I used to wonder
if I loved him at all.

20:00.560 --> 20:01.710
- You're his daughter.
- Mmm-hmm.

20:03.400 --> 20:04.914
But he was closer to you.

20:07.360 --> 20:08.680
He enjoyed teaching me.

20:13.600 --> 20:14.590
So,

20:15.720 --> 20:17.677
get some sleep, Ronit.

20:18.640 --> 20:19.790
Good night.

20:19.880 --> 20:20.996
Oh, I brought you, um...

20:23.920 --> 20:26.913
I brought this for...
Well, for you.

20:27.440 --> 20:28.430
It's...

20:29.880 --> 20:31.678
- Oh, it's your pictures.
- Yeah.

20:31.760 --> 20:32.750
Wonderful.

20:35.440 --> 20:36.669
Thank you.

20:36.760 --> 20:37.750
Pleasure.

20:40.000 --> 20:40.990
Good night.

20:42.720 --> 20:44.757
So is it good being
married to each other?

20:47.920 --> 20:48.910
Yes.

20:50.480 --> 20:51.834
We're very happy.

20:53.680 --> 20:54.750
Good night.

23:19.760 --> 23:20.910
You all right?

23:37.960 --> 23:38.950
That's my dad.

23:42.080 --> 23:43.196
Come on, let's go.

23:45.400 --> 23:46.595
Sorry for your loss.

24:14.640 --> 24:15.710
You okay?

24:16.360 --> 24:17.396
Yes.

24:29.360 --> 24:30.476
Good morning,
Mrs. Kuperman!

24:30.560 --> 24:31.994
Morning, Rina.
How are you?

24:32.120 --> 24:33.554
- Good, thank you.
- Good.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.438
- How was your week?
- Good.

24:36.400 --> 24:37.800
- Good morning, girls.
- Good morning.

24:37.880 --> 24:38.870
Good morning, Hannah.

24:38.960 --> 24:42.431
At first, as she's never had
a class of her own, but no.

24:42.520 --> 24:43.590
Good.

24:43.680 --> 24:46.036
I've really appreciated
the time off.

24:46.160 --> 24:47.150
Of course.

24:47.560 --> 24:49.233
It's good to have
you back, Esti.

24:49.360 --> 24:50.350
Oh, thank you.

25:24.880 --> 25:26.360
Good morning, girls.

25:26.440 --> 25:28.511
Good morning,
Mrs. Kuperman.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.400
Well, I missed you.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.159
- Yosef.
- Rabbi!

25:42.240 --> 25:43.276
Morning.

25:43.800 --> 25:45.792
- Dr. Rigler.
- Good morning.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.913
How is your speech
coming along?

25:48.280 --> 25:49.873
I'm working on it.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.390
- It will be a wonderful Hesped.
- I hope so.

25:52.480 --> 25:54.437
The Rav would be
very proud of you, Dovid.

25:55.240 --> 25:56.230
Appreciate that.

25:58.080 --> 26:00.595
Ronit Krushka
is staying with you, hmm?

26:00.720 --> 26:01.995
Yes, she is.

26:07.640 --> 26:08.710
Good day.

26:11.640 --> 26:14.519
"A bundle of myrrh
is my beloved to me,

26:14.960 --> 26:18.749
"that lies all night
between my breasts.

26:20.440 --> 26:24.832
"My beloved is to me
as a cluster of henna blooms

26:25.160 --> 26:27.072
"in the vineyards
of Ein-Gedi."

26:30.280 --> 26:31.600
Is it about sensuality?

26:32.480 --> 26:36.076
That is, the way in which
true love manifests itself?

26:37.280 --> 26:38.794
But might it also be

26:40.280 --> 26:42.317
that between a male
and a female

26:42.400 --> 26:44.153
that there's something
higher than that.

26:45.760 --> 26:48.958
But isn't it that the
references to sensual pleasures

26:49.040 --> 26:50.554
celebrate physical
love here?

26:51.480 --> 26:53.995
The enjoyment of that love becomes,
in this context, the highest.

26:54.480 --> 26:56.597
"See, you are fair,
my love,

26:58.040 --> 26:59.360
"you are fair,

27:00.280 --> 27:01.873
"your eyes are doves.

27:02.840 --> 27:06.800
"See, you are handsome,
my beloved, yea, pleasing,

27:07.280 --> 27:09.431
"and our bed is verdant."

27:12.280 --> 27:14.317
Could I have a piece
of apple strudel?

27:14.800 --> 27:19.636
And, um, also,
could I get one of these?

27:20.040 --> 27:21.190
The Linzer biscuit, yeah.

27:21.320 --> 27:22.595
- Linzer biscuit?
- Yeah.

27:24.120 --> 27:25.793
- Thanks very much.
- Thank you.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.195
Do you have shoes?

28:44.960 --> 28:46.235
Yeah, okay.

28:46.800 --> 28:47.916
Candles...

28:52.680 --> 28:54.000
What? Is it wrong?

28:54.520 --> 28:55.795
It's only Uncle Hartog.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.469
No, and Rabbi
and Rebbetzin Goldfarb.

29:01.800 --> 29:03.200
He still invited me?

29:03.600 --> 29:05.159
No, I have invited you.

29:06.720 --> 29:08.154
- Come on.
- Okay.

29:11.440 --> 29:12.794
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

29:14.280 --> 29:15.270
Okay.

29:45.640 --> 29:47.359
- Good Shabbos.
- Good Shabbos.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.076
Good Shabbos.

29:51.160 --> 29:52.276
Good Shabbos.

30:11.960 --> 30:12.950
- Amen
- OTHERS: Amen.

30:48.600 --> 30:49.795
We understood it
the first time,

30:49.920 --> 30:51.513
you don't have
to explain it.

30:51.920 --> 30:52.910
She always

30:53.600 --> 30:56.559
overexplains a joke.
That's the trouble.

30:57.080 --> 30:59.037
- He never lets it go.
- Hard to get by with such a Jewish name.

30:59.120 --> 31:02.033
Every day he mentions his name.
It's unbelievable.

31:02.120 --> 31:03.520
What kind of
a name is "Andy"?

31:03.600 --> 31:05.956
He's got nothing else to say
about him except his name.

31:06.040 --> 31:07.918
What? No, I have something else to say.
He's a nebbish.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.751
- Yeah, that's the other thing.
- I'm sorry, I love my son.

31:10.840 --> 31:12.832
This is his
own father talking.

31:12.920 --> 31:15.480
- Yeah, what do you think?
- I love him.

31:15.600 --> 31:17.796
So our youngest, Basha,
just had her second boy.

31:17.920 --> 31:22.836
And they named him Daniel, for my father.
Ah, mazel tov.

31:23.480 --> 31:25.472
They live in Australia.
It's too far.

31:25.960 --> 31:26.950
Melbourne.

31:27.040 --> 31:28.633
Thirty-seven grandchildren!

31:29.320 --> 31:30.879
- Mazel tov.
- Not bad.

31:32.760 --> 31:35.594
We saw your photos
in a magazine.

31:36.080 --> 31:39.278
It was the pictures of the
twins that you showed us.

31:40.280 --> 31:42.556
But they
called you Ronnie Curtis?

31:42.640 --> 31:44.154
That's my
professional name.

31:44.440 --> 31:46.557
What was wrong with
your real name, Krushka?

31:46.640 --> 31:48.120
You should be proud of it.

31:48.560 --> 31:50.756
Artists change
their names sometimes,

31:50.840 --> 31:52.832
- don't they, Moshe?
- That's right, Fruma.

31:53.880 --> 31:56.395
Women change
their names every day.

31:57.080 --> 31:58.230
They take their
husband's names

31:58.320 --> 31:59.879
and their own
history is gone.

32:03.200 --> 32:04.270
Don't they?

32:04.840 --> 32:06.433
I wouldn't talk
about "gone."

32:06.840 --> 32:07.876
Not gone.

32:08.600 --> 32:10.717
Yes, they do.

32:14.880 --> 32:15.870
Ronit,

32:16.520 --> 32:18.159
you look so like
your mother.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.674
Oh, don't start!

32:19.800 --> 32:22.554
Hasn't she got Leah's eyes,
don't you think, Moshe?

32:22.640 --> 32:24.040
Yeah, she's got
beautiful eyes.

32:24.120 --> 32:25.918
- Oh, she's a beauty.
- Uncle...

32:27.920 --> 32:30.833
Your dear sister
was taken far too soon.

32:33.040 --> 32:34.315
And now the Rav.

32:35.400 --> 32:38.234
This must be a terrible
shock for you, Ronit.

32:39.840 --> 32:42.230
You're away, it's a shock.
Of course it is.

32:43.840 --> 32:45.320
We never thought
we'd see you again.

32:45.880 --> 32:47.473
Sorry to disappoint you.

32:47.560 --> 32:48.630
Ronit...

32:49.680 --> 32:51.797
- More coffee?
- Oh, no. No thanks.

32:51.880 --> 32:54.440
I'd love to talk to you about the house,
though, at some point, Uncle.

32:56.280 --> 32:57.316
Yeah, sorry.

32:57.400 --> 32:58.550
Come to the office.

32:59.080 --> 33:00.400
- We'll talk about it there.
- All right.

33:01.240 --> 33:05.234
You know, you must take your
mother's candlesticks, Ronit.

33:05.360 --> 33:07.397
From the house.
Yes, of course, and then

33:07.920 --> 33:10.116
- you must give them to your children.
- Oh, I don't want children.

33:10.200 --> 33:11.793
I'm not having children.

33:11.880 --> 33:13.758
You keep them and then
you pass them on.

33:13.880 --> 33:17.556
Yes. Yes. I want
to sell the house, Uncle.

33:17.720 --> 33:20.315
Do you think you can help me to sell it?
No, please.

33:20.680 --> 33:22.831
- Not now.
- I'm gonna need some help, though.

33:22.920 --> 33:25.196
- Yes, but not... Ronit...
- Sorry.

33:27.440 --> 33:29.272
How old were you, Dovid,

33:29.400 --> 33:31.596
when the Rav took
you in and taught you?

33:31.680 --> 33:32.796
Thirteen, was it?

33:33.240 --> 33:36.472
Mmm... Yeah.
Twelve, thirteen.

33:36.720 --> 33:38.757
Dovid has been
doing great work.

33:38.880 --> 33:40.872
Wonderful work.
Wonderful work.

33:41.440 --> 33:43.875
A lot has changed
since you were here.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.719
There's a lot of problems.

33:46.280 --> 33:47.794
Housing, and jobs...

33:48.400 --> 33:49.390
The youth.

33:50.040 --> 33:51.633
Even an incident with drugs.

33:51.800 --> 33:54.395
Perhaps people should stop
having so many children.

33:56.720 --> 33:58.040
It's nothing we
cannot deal with.

34:02.600 --> 34:04.239
And you're not married.

34:04.720 --> 34:06.757
You must find
someone, Ronit.

34:07.440 --> 34:10.080
- It's not funny growing old alone.
- Oh, well I'm rarely alone.

34:10.199 --> 34:11.793
I've got wonderful friends.

34:13.719 --> 34:16.440
I expect you have lots of fun.
But that will pass.

34:17.440 --> 34:19.237
But being married, well,

34:20.239 --> 34:21.754
that's the way
it should be.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.516
Oh, is it?
The way it should be?

34:24.600 --> 34:27.353
Or is it just
institutional obligation?

34:27.440 --> 34:30.000
Now, Ronit,
stop right there.

34:30.080 --> 34:31.911
I mean, Uncle,
let's just say

34:32.000 --> 34:33.992
I stayed here
for one more year.

34:34.080 --> 34:35.799
Let's think about this,
okay, right?

34:35.880 --> 34:37.599
I would be
married off to whoever

34:37.760 --> 34:40.400
and then, after ten years
in some loveless marriage

34:40.480 --> 34:41.880
I might have ended up
killing myself.

34:41.960 --> 34:43.996
Or I would've felt
like killing myself.

35:00.040 --> 35:04.478
I am really jetlagged,
so I think I should...

35:05.760 --> 35:07.114
I'm gonna hit the road.

35:07.200 --> 35:08.839
And, I'll see you both
back at the house.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.471
It was great to see you,
Rabbi, Rebbetzin, Fruma.

35:13.080 --> 35:14.070
Happy Shabbos, darling.

35:15.120 --> 35:17.112
Uncle,
thank you for dinner.

35:17.200 --> 35:20.193
- I'll see you guys...
- Why don't you walk her home,

35:20.880 --> 35:22.473
- and I'll catch up.
- Okay.

35:25.680 --> 35:27.319
Sorry.

35:30.320 --> 35:32.312
Thank you,
it was delicious.

35:32.920 --> 35:34.639
- Good Shabbos.
- Good Shabbos.

35:37.040 --> 35:38.030
Ronit.

35:40.080 --> 35:41.116
Hmm.

35:50.640 --> 35:53.951
Why is Rebbetzin
Goldfarb so mean?

35:54.600 --> 35:57.160
She has a good life.
What does she want?

35:57.360 --> 35:58.510
Mmm.

35:58.600 --> 35:59.920
What does anybody want?

36:00.960 --> 36:03.316
What do you really want?
Do you know what you really want?

36:03.400 --> 36:05.437
Yes, I do. I do know.

36:07.680 --> 36:09.831
I want my dad to know
that I loved him.

36:11.760 --> 36:13.035
Do you think
he knew that?

36:15.160 --> 36:16.435
Yes, yes, he did.

36:18.120 --> 36:19.270
He had to know.

36:23.080 --> 36:25.640
I'm so sorry,
so sorry, Ronit.

36:29.760 --> 36:31.114
The Rav...

36:33.720 --> 36:35.279
You've lost your father.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.031
It goes well, actually.
It's lovely, yeah.

36:58.120 --> 37:00.476
I don't normally wear such a bright color.
It's really good.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.671
It goes with the tempo.
It looks beautiful.

37:02.800 --> 37:05.190
- So if you want to just...
- You can just...

37:06.640 --> 37:08.916
- He's ready for you now.
- Thanks.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.632
Um, the wig...

37:17.040 --> 37:19.509
- Uh, Ronit, hello.
- Hello.

37:19.600 --> 37:21.512
- Let's go upstairs, shall we?
- Okay.

37:23.760 --> 37:24.910
Come in.

37:25.520 --> 37:26.749
Have a seat, please.

37:30.560 --> 37:31.550
Ronit...

37:32.320 --> 37:33.549
I've gone frum!

37:34.600 --> 37:36.637
Please don't joke. Hmm?

37:38.640 --> 37:39.630
So...

37:43.560 --> 37:47.395
These are the keys for you to
gather any personal possessions.

37:47.480 --> 37:48.596
A lot of keys.

37:48.680 --> 37:49.875
Hmm.

37:53.400 --> 37:54.550
Would you help me sell it?

38:05.280 --> 38:06.270
Clause three.

38:10.880 --> 38:13.440
"Last will and testament
of Rav Shlomo Krushka."

38:13.960 --> 38:17.351
Rav Krushka, bless his memory,
left the house

38:17.480 --> 38:20.598
and everything in it
to the synagogue.

38:26.440 --> 38:28.318
- I'm sorry if that's a shock.
- No.

38:29.960 --> 38:31.189
It's just a house.

38:34.920 --> 38:38.311
A father should have a child to
look after him in his final hours.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.790
I didn't know
that he was ill.

38:40.920 --> 38:43.116
How could you know
when you're not here?

38:58.320 --> 38:59.640
You were all he had left.

39:01.640 --> 39:02.630
I know.

39:03.360 --> 39:05.113
It must be very
painful for you

39:06.360 --> 39:08.829
not to receive
the Rav's forgiveness.

39:26.640 --> 39:28.233
Hello, Mrs. Kuperman!

39:29.640 --> 39:31.393
- Hello, Shmuli!
- Hello.

39:31.480 --> 39:33.949
- Rivkah, hi.
- Hello, Esti.

39:34.400 --> 39:36.710
- You look great.
- Oh, thank you!

39:37.200 --> 39:39.795
- Is everyone okay?
- Yeah, we're good. We're good!

39:39.880 --> 39:41.280
- Good, good.
- And, and,

39:41.360 --> 39:44.432
all the help, Esti,
it was very appreciated.

39:44.720 --> 39:45.710
Of course.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.993
Hi, Shayna. Hi!

39:50.720 --> 39:53.030
Oh, so sweet.

39:53.720 --> 39:55.234
I saw Ronit just now.

39:55.960 --> 39:57.076
Oh...

39:57.400 --> 40:00.393
- Where?
- She was just walking down the street.

40:02.080 --> 40:03.560
She hasn't changed,
has she?

40:04.520 --> 40:05.510
No...

40:06.120 --> 40:07.190
She hasn't.

40:09.920 --> 40:11.115
Oh, okay.

40:12.080 --> 40:13.992
- See you later.
- Bye, bye.

40:14.080 --> 40:15.833
- Bye.
- Bye, Mrs. Kuperman.

40:15.920 --> 40:17.912
There, there.
There, there.

41:03.360 --> 41:04.635
Ronit?

41:09.840 --> 41:11.672
Uh... You're
wearing a wig.

41:15.480 --> 41:16.470
No.

41:40.360 --> 41:43.000
Here. Here, let me.

41:46.840 --> 41:47.830
There you go.

41:49.200 --> 41:50.190
Thank you.

42:35.160 --> 42:36.879
I'm sorry
it's such a mess. I...

42:38.280 --> 42:41.432
Your uncle said he was taking
care of everything, and...

42:42.880 --> 42:44.678
He didn't want us
to touch anything

42:45.720 --> 42:47.359
before they
take it away.

42:48.960 --> 42:50.235
Hmm.

43:47.520 --> 43:49.034
He left it all
to the synagogue.

43:50.280 --> 43:51.555
Mmm-hmm.

43:53.240 --> 43:54.276
Would you really want it?

43:55.160 --> 43:57.277
Financial freedom? No.

43:57.720 --> 43:58.995
That would be
far too easy.

44:03.160 --> 44:07.677
Would've been nice, though,
if he'd just mentioned me in his will.

44:10.760 --> 44:13.514
Left me a pipe.

44:15.000 --> 44:15.990
I know.

44:48.960 --> 44:50.189
I'm not gonna go
to the Hesped.

44:51.800 --> 44:54.190
- What?
- There's no point in my being here.

44:55.880 --> 44:57.155
I'm gonna change
my ticket.

44:57.840 --> 44:58.830
But...

45:23.560 --> 45:27.031
Mmm.

45:28.880 --> 45:32.078
You know, what really gets me
is I never took his portrait.

45:48.160 --> 45:49.230
So, all he did all day,

45:49.320 --> 45:50.834
was stay in here
and read the Torah

45:50.920 --> 45:54.152
and the commentaries on the Torah
and the notes on the commentaries

45:54.280 --> 45:56.237
- and the debates on the notes.
- Mmm.

45:58.880 --> 46:01.031
And it meant we could
do what we wanted.

46:11.800 --> 46:13.837
Esti, do you think
I should go back early?

46:38.920 --> 46:39.910
No.

46:43.800 --> 46:44.790
No.

46:46.240 --> 46:48.596
No, I don't think
you should leave at all.

46:50.240 --> 46:51.959
Oh, thank you.

46:53.800 --> 46:54.950
Thank you.

46:58.080 --> 46:59.150
Oh...

46:59.240 --> 47:00.640
Ronit...

47:02.400 --> 47:03.595
Esti...

47:04.720 --> 47:07.030
When I saw you...

47:09.320 --> 47:10.640
Me too.

47:56.880 --> 47:58.997
Esti, Esti, Esti...

48:03.880 --> 48:04.870
Oh, no.

48:30.800 --> 48:33.031
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

48:33.120 --> 48:34.110
No, it's...

48:35.080 --> 48:36.275
It's okay.

48:37.080 --> 48:38.116
I'm really sorry.

48:38.200 --> 48:39.793
It's fine.

48:41.080 --> 48:42.070
I...

48:45.640 --> 48:47.199
You do look
like your mother.

48:53.360 --> 48:54.680
Oh...

48:58.800 --> 49:01.031
Ronit, are you okay?

49:21.600 --> 49:25.037
It was me
who rang the shul

49:25.640 --> 49:27.279
in New York
to let you know.

49:32.160 --> 49:33.958
I'm just gonna
get some air.

50:09.840 --> 50:12.912
Why did you get married, Esti?
Why didn't you just leave?

50:13.000 --> 50:16.391
Do you remember what the Rav
used to say about marriage?

50:17.200 --> 50:19.510
- No.
- You do.

50:20.360 --> 50:22.920
"Will you grow
old alone?"

50:23.040 --> 50:27.273
No, no. "Will you grow old
with no family, no joys?"

50:28.800 --> 50:30.473
"Dovid is
a good boy. He...

50:30.560 --> 50:34.759
"He has a generous heart,
and he's crazy about you. Marry him."

50:36.240 --> 50:38.436
So everything was
all right when I left?

50:39.880 --> 50:40.870
No.

50:41.360 --> 50:43.158
I was ill.

50:43.640 --> 50:44.710
What sort of ill?

50:45.920 --> 50:47.036
In my head.

50:48.560 --> 50:50.233
The Rav was afraid for me,

50:50.320 --> 50:52.596
and if I had to sleep
with a man,

50:52.680 --> 50:54.831
why not with
our best friend?

50:55.080 --> 50:56.878
Oh, Esti...

50:56.960 --> 51:01.910
I think, I think he felt that
marriage would cure me.

51:03.120 --> 51:05.237
It hasn't been
a complete disaster.

51:05.560 --> 51:06.835
And that's enough?

51:07.960 --> 51:09.917
Do you have to have
sex every Friday?

51:10.000 --> 51:11.593
- It's expected.
- It's medieval.

51:11.680 --> 51:12.830
It's not mandatory.

51:12.920 --> 51:15.037
Nobody gets beaten
if they don't feel like it.

51:15.120 --> 51:16.793
What happened to you?

51:18.200 --> 51:19.190
Nothing.

51:19.960 --> 51:21.155
You happened to me.

51:22.120 --> 51:25.158
And then I started teaching
and that became important.

51:25.760 --> 51:27.479
You can teach anywhere.

51:27.560 --> 51:29.677
I really love the girls.

51:29.760 --> 51:31.752
And I give them ambition.

51:31.880 --> 51:34.600
To do what? Push out seven
babies and be a good wife?

51:34.680 --> 51:37.673
Don't. Don't.
I'm a good teacher.

51:38.000 --> 51:41.277
- And I help them to value themselves.
- Okay, but what about you?

51:41.960 --> 51:43.235
That is me.

51:48.280 --> 51:49.270
Huh.

51:49.360 --> 51:50.350
What?

51:57.160 --> 51:58.310
Do you want a cigarette?

51:59.520 --> 52:01.318
No.

52:01.960 --> 52:04.395
And you? Are you happy?

52:04.760 --> 52:05.750
Yes, I am.

52:11.000 --> 52:12.514
Have you been
with other women?

52:14.280 --> 52:15.270
No.

52:17.000 --> 52:17.990
Not really.

52:18.480 --> 52:19.709
Mmm.

52:19.800 --> 52:20.790
And you?

52:22.040 --> 52:23.030
No.

52:27.280 --> 52:28.270
But, Esti...

52:31.480 --> 52:33.437
Do you still
only fancy women?

52:34.640 --> 52:35.994
Mmm-hmm.

52:51.880 --> 52:54.440
Your bag is, um...

52:54.520 --> 52:55.510
What?

52:56.840 --> 52:58.752
It's extremely erotic.

53:00.880 --> 53:03.679
- Can I take it for a spin?
- Mmm-mmm. No.

53:04.280 --> 53:05.953
You're not frum.
You don't get one.

53:06.040 --> 53:07.190
Oh, please.

53:07.720 --> 53:10.474
- No.
- A quick spin. Come on.

53:10.840 --> 53:13.036
- Please.
- Fine. Have a turn.

53:13.120 --> 53:15.396
One sexy bag, baby.

53:17.880 --> 53:19.200
What about children?

53:19.720 --> 53:23.714
I have three in the bag.
All redheads.

53:28.720 --> 53:30.074
I think it suits me.

53:50.000 --> 53:51.832
This is where
you first kissed me.

54:01.800 --> 54:03.757
It's insane
that you're here.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.559
Oh, fuck!

54:53.600 --> 54:54.795
Ronit?

54:55.280 --> 54:56.396
Is that you?

54:57.360 --> 54:59.591
- Yes.
- What are you doing here?

54:59.880 --> 55:03.669
Oh, I'm just having a wander
around the old places.

55:04.400 --> 55:06.153
This is my husband, Lev.

55:06.960 --> 55:09.350
This is Ronit,
the Rav's daughter.

55:10.360 --> 55:12.591
Remember? I told you
all about her.

55:13.920 --> 55:15.320
How's it going, Lev? Hi.

55:16.600 --> 55:18.796
I hear that you're
attending the Hesped.

55:20.480 --> 55:22.676
The Rav was
a truly great man.

55:22.840 --> 55:24.877
Oh, yes, I know,
I'm his daughter.

55:26.160 --> 55:27.389
Would you like
a cigarette?

55:30.200 --> 55:32.112
Was that
Rebbetzin Kuperman?

55:33.320 --> 55:34.356
No.

56:38.320 --> 56:39.356
Esti!

56:40.080 --> 56:41.196
Are you all right?

56:42.080 --> 56:44.754
Uh, yes. I'm fine.

56:47.200 --> 56:48.316
Esti...

56:50.280 --> 56:51.794
I'll be out in a minute.

56:53.840 --> 56:55.194
What's happened?

56:58.200 --> 56:59.190
What?

57:00.800 --> 57:01.916
What's happened?

58:03.160 --> 58:06.073
<i>"'Tis true.
There's magic in the web of it.</i>

58:06.560 --> 58:08.995
"A sibyl, that had number'd
in the world

58:09.400 --> 58:11.790
"The sun to course
200 compasses,

58:12.160 --> 58:14.470
"In her prophetic fury
sew'd the work.

58:14.960 --> 58:17.270
"The worms were hallow'd
that did breed the silk,

58:17.360 --> 58:19.829
"And it was dy'd in mummy
which the skilful

58:19.920 --> 58:21.434
"Conserv'd of
maidens' hearts."

58:22.280 --> 58:23.509
Very good, Sara.

58:24.800 --> 58:27.520
So what stands out for you
in the play so far?

58:27.800 --> 58:29.996
The handkerchief.
With the strawberries on it.

58:30.080 --> 58:31.309
Mmm-hmm.

58:31.600 --> 58:33.319
And why is
that significant?

58:34.600 --> 58:35.590
Anyone?

58:36.520 --> 58:39.513
Do you remember what Othello
says about how it was made?

58:41.400 --> 58:42.595
Yes, Rina.

58:42.680 --> 58:45.752
He says that the red of it
was dye from virgins' blood.

58:45.840 --> 58:48.400
That's right.
That's right. Yes?

58:48.480 --> 58:49.675
And the lies.

58:49.800 --> 58:52.599
Iago just lies more and more.
And you don't know why.

58:52.720 --> 58:55.235
Mmm. And the killing,
Mrs. Kuperman.

58:55.320 --> 58:57.596
- That was horrible.
- It was.

58:57.720 --> 58:59.120
Her death is very shocking.

58:59.640 --> 59:00.630
But...

59:03.360 --> 59:05.272
- I'm sorry to interrupt, Mrs. Kuperman.
- It's all right.

59:05.360 --> 59:07.113
Mrs. Shapiro needs
to see you.

59:07.600 --> 59:10.320
Uh, thank you.
I'll go in the break.

59:10.720 --> 59:12.120
Immediately, she said.

59:14.040 --> 59:15.713
Keep reading the scenes
in pairs, girls.

59:15.800 --> 59:17.075
I'll be right back.
Thank you.

59:17.160 --> 59:18.594
Good morning, girls.

59:18.680 --> 59:20.956
Good morning,
Miss Scheinberg.

59:21.400 --> 59:22.993
Carry on reading
where you left off.

59:40.400 --> 59:41.675
Come in, Esti.

59:44.240 --> 59:45.356
Mrs. Shapiro...

59:46.000 --> 59:47.070
Have a seat.

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:03.194
We would all be very happy if you
chose to take on the Rav's work.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:07.636
There are always obstacles, of course,
to anything that is challenging.

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:10.030
It would be difficult to
measure up to the Rav

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:11.789
in any meaningful way.

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:13.470
And your wife.

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:15.912
She would welcome it
if you took over the shul?

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.710
Yes. Esti will support me with
whatever decision I make.

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:21.954
And Ronit Krushka?

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:24.551
We were surprised
at her presence.

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:28.760
Ronit is grieving.

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:32.913
And we will make her
very welcome at the Hesped.

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:35.230
Of course.

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:40.436
And Esti? She won't be
distracted by Ronit's return?

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:42.956
Why should she be?

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.992
This is my house
we're talking about.

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:48.230
I keep it in order.

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:50.910
Good.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:04.430
Hello.

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:11.355
Esti? What's happened?

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:16.472
- Are you all right?
- Not here.

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.030
Yesterday,

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:26.557
I behaved like an adolescent.

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:32.639
So stupid
and so senseless.

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.114
Did someone
say something?

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:37.193
Yes! Yes!
And I live here.

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.760
Tell me,
what did they say?

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:41.073
The headmistress, she...

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:43.120
It doesn't matter.
I...

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.520
We need to stop this.

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.156
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:51.554
I can't do this. I can't.

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:55.030
Okay.

01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:59.874
We try here.
We try to lead a good life.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.514
I know. I know.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.879
And I do believe profoundly.

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:09.800
The word of Hashem
is my life.

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:12.510
I am...

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:15.600
I'm going to
leave tomorrow.

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:17.399
I don't want you to go.

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:19.914
I don't want that.

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:23.392
Esti, I didn't know anything like this was
going to happen. I really didn't. I...

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:27.235
I didn't even know that I was
going to see you for sure.

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:39.150
Can we just go somewhere else?
Can we just get out of here?

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.040
Please, come on.
Come on.

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:44.191
We need to just
go somewhere else.

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:13.350
Come here.

01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:59.718
I used to think about
your life in New York.

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:01.720
Mmm.

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:05.197
I tried to imagine
your room.

01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:14.720
I kept track of
the time difference.

01:08:16.319 --> 01:08:19.392
So I knew when you were awake
and when you were asleep.

01:08:44.479 --> 01:08:45.470
What?

01:08:47.399 --> 01:08:52.111
I was just thinking of
the Rav walking in on us.

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:53.634
Oh, don't.

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:55.916
His face.

01:08:58.319 --> 01:08:59.435
What did he say?

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:03.032
"Hashem,
strike me dead!"

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:04.919
Oh, no!

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:08.715
It was awful.

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:42.473
I want to take your picture.

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:48.752
For the <i>Jewish Messenger?</i>

01:09:51.399 --> 01:09:53.595
No. No.

01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:57.114
Look at me.

01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:58.749
Esti, look at me.

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:53.110
Esti?

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.520
Sorry I'm so late.

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:41.595
Did you eat something?

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:15.390
Don't...

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:44.313
Mrs. Shapiro made a formal
complaint about you and Ronit.

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:49.236
What?

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:52.554
She came to you?

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:56.350
Yes.

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:23.950
Tell me the truth.

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:30.555
I, uh... I kissed Ronit.

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:37.950
You kissed her?

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:41.676
I'm sorry.

01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:42.910
Esti!

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:44.753
- What are you doing to us?
- I've tried!

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:46.274
- I have!
- What do you want?

01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:47.919
- I've tried!
- What do you want?

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.275
You want to be hurt again?

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:51.992
Has Ronit asked you
to go back with her?

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:53.070
Oh, Dovid!

01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:56.399
She'll go back to her friends.
Her men.

01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.280
What's wrong with you?

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:01.634
What's wrong with you?

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.837
I mean, what is it?
Just tell me.

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:08.320
You can tell me.

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:09.954
- Can I? Can I?
- Yes.

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:12.959
- We've always been honest with each other.
- Have we?

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:14.594
- We have. Yes.
- Have we?

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:19.956
I got the message to Ronit
about her father.

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:24.960
- I wanted her to come back.
- No.

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:26.679
- Yes. Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't.

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:28.519
- She's taking advantage of you.
- Look at me.

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:31.155
- You can't even see it, you're blind.
- No, no one's taking advantage.

01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:32.959
- You're blind!
- No!

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:34.156
Look at me!

01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:36.239
I wanted it to happen.

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:38.920
And when we were girls...

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:42.990
Even then, it was the same.
It's always been this way!

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:48.631
I have always wanted it.

01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:07.280
I think you should leave him.

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:09.230
Really?

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:11.953
And where would I go?

01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:23.069
I'm late for school.

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:33.670
Rabbi...

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:44.950
Fruma.

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:48.230
Elliot.

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:51.637
The Rav would be so happy
to know that you came.

01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:53.275
I'm so glad we could come.

01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:58.675
Joey, thank you for coming
from so far.

01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:01.078
- Rabbi, I wish you long life.
- Thank you.

01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:03.393
- Rabbi.
- Thank you for being here.

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:05.239
- The Rav will be immensely missed.
- Thank you.

01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:08.719
- We're very sorry.
- Thank you for coming.

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:10.190
Very sorry.

01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:46.150
Are you not eating?

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:50.750
It's good.

01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:54.191
- Very good.
- Hmm.

01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:58.157
I booked a flight.
I'll be leaving tonight.

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:01.870
What?

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:05.675
Oh.

01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:07.990
That's good.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.275
That's good.

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:19.393
I hope the Hesped goes well.

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.069
Now it will.

01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:24.790
What about you?

01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:26.710
What?

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:28.954
What will you be doing?

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:33.592
Uh, I don't know.

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:36.870
Try. Try to explain it to me.

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:42.792
I can't.

01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:50.313
Oh, I should pack.

01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:07.236
Goodbye.

01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:13.353
It's easier to leave,
isn't it?

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:24.390
No, it isn't.

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:54.675
Are you free?

01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:08.596
Excuse me.

01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:12.910
Hello?

01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:15.950
Dovid?

01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:18.070
No.

01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:22.199
No, she's not with me.

01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:26.634
When did you last see her?

01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:33.192
Well, she'll be back, Dovid,
don't worry.

01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:36.595
- Excuse me?
- Yeah.

01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:40.157
Oh, I'm sorry, Dovid, can I call you
back when I've gone through security?

01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:45.031
Hello. Hello,
where are you flying to today?

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:47.790
New York.

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:38.716
Esti!

01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:44.590
Esti.

01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:52.350
Esti!

01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:04.435
Hmm.

01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:02.230
Esti?

01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:16.153
I wish she'd never
contacted you.

01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:19.396
Well, I'm glad that she did
the right thing.

01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:21.280
My father died.

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:24.992
- You weren't even going to let me know.
- Can you see why I didn't?

01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:27.160
I was protecting my wife.

01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:28.870
Dovid...

01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:43.717
I want you to give me
my freedom.

01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:57.120
Esti, come here.

01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:01.794
I was terrified.

01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:04.033
I'm sorry.

01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:05.959
I didn't mean
for you to worry.

01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:09.950
I'm pregnant.

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:24.030
A child.

01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:29.919
Hashem is looking over us.

01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:33.869
I don't think we should be
together anymore.

01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:35.674
- It's His wish.
- No.

01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:42.152
I was born
into this community.

01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:44.194
I had no choice.

01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:48.079
I want my child to be free
to decide.

01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:53.152
We've waited so long
for this.

01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:56.953
Please give me my freedom.

01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:01.151
No, no, no...

01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:03.517
- Dovid, you can't...
- Stay out of it.

01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:06.030
I can't.

01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:08.590
I'm sorry.

01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:55.709
You came back.

01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:15.233
- Fruma.
- Esti.

01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:18.554
I don't want to upset anyone.
I just need to honor my father.

01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:21.356
I know.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:02.990
Please.

01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:51.315
Amen.

01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:58.231
Why don't you come
to New York?

01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:06.430
Why don't you just come
to New York and be with me?

01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:30.873
Rav Krushka's departure

01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:33.194
leaves us

01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:36.279
facing a void,

01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:38.755
bewildered.

01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:41.556
Today,

01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:44.957
we take comfort in knowing

01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:48.954
that his legacy
will be preserved

01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:52.112
and carried through
to the next generation.

01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:57.152
I call upon a new voice,

01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:02.394
Rav Krushka's
closest disciple,

01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:07.350
spiritual son

01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:11.116
and successor,

01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:15.359
Rabbi Dovid Kuperman.

01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:22.389
Rabbi Kuperman.

01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:15.071
Rav Krushka often spoke about
the duty of the teacher.

01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:17.110
The duty...

01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:31.954
I'm sorry, I can't...

01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:52.110
The Rav's only child, Ronit Krushka,
is here with us today.

01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:02.152
The Rav's final words
to us...

01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:08.551
Why did he choose to discuss
the idea of choice?

01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:12.910
And freedom.

01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:19.477
There's nothing so tender

01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:21.952
or truthful

01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:26.510
as the true feeling
of being free.

01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:29.957
Hmm? Free to choose.

01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:35.154
The Rav was a giant of Torah.

01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:39.514
But it wasn't a giant
we saw collapse that day.

01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:41.435
It was a man.

01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:44.317
He talked of the angels

01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:47.234
and of the desires of
the beasts.

01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:51.158
And with his final words,

01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:54.153
he reminded us of this.

01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:57.959
We are free to choose!

01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:29.600
You are free.

01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:42.354
You are free!

01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:57.718
I cannot accept the honor or

01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:01.117
position that is offered
to me.

01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:05.750
I do not have
sufficient understanding.

01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:11.595
Please forgive me.

01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:06.353
I'm just, uh, slipping out.

01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:17.710
Shalom.

01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:23.154
Goodbye, Dovid.

01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:43.279
- Morning.
- Good morning.

01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:45.950
Morning.

01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:47.270
Morning.

01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:53.199
Is that you, then?

01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:06.630
Goodbye.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:09.990
Goodbye.

01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:16.359
May you live a long life.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.878
May you live a long life.

01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:45.519
- Which terminal?
- Five, please.

01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:04.832
Ronit! Wait!

01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:08.309
Stop! Could you stop, please?
Stop the car.

01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:26.832
You will be
a brilliant mother.

01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:31.557
You're going to be brave
and beautiful.

01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:33.350
I love you.

01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:35.270
I love you.

01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:38.114
Will you tell me
where you are?

01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:42.955
Yes. I will.

01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:25.150
Excuse me?

01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:28.832
Do you mind
if we make a small detour?

01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:25.235
Goodbye, Dad.
