No. On the other hand,
she has gotten very angry

01:59:12.818 --> 01:59:14.752
that we're turning the riot
footage over to the D.A.

01:59:14.820 --> 01:59:16.686
-- Interesting.
-- Yeah.

01:59:16.755 --> 01:59:18.348
-- Puzzlement.
-- Casey...

01:59:18.423 --> 01:59:20.448
no, 'cause I could be, like, a blind
detective, have my own TV show.

01:59:20.525 --> 01:59:22.960
You <i>do</i> have
your own TV show.

01:59:23.028 --> 01:59:25.053
Ah, yes, the student
becomes the teacher.

01:59:25.130 --> 01:59:28.361
Anyway, this is what's going on
today, so it's a good day to be nice.

01:59:28.433 --> 01:59:30.492
-- <i>I'm always nice.</i>
-- <i>Rund0wn's at 10:00.</i>

01:59:30.569 --> 01:59:32.765
By the way, Dana,
you look hot today.

01:59:32.838 --> 01:59:33.964
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
what are you wearing?

01:59:34.039 --> 01:59:35.973
That's three, Johnny.

01:59:36.041 --> 01:59:38.601
[Sighs deeply]

01:59:40.712 --> 01:59:42.646
<i>-- He'!-
-- He'!-</i>

01:59:42.714 --> 01:59:43.977
What are you doin'?

01:59:44.049 --> 01:59:45.141
Home-ice advantage.

01:59:45.217 --> 01:59:46.184
Hmm?

01:59:46.251 --> 01:59:47.309
Home-ice advantage --

01:59:47.386 --> 01:59:49.286
the advantage of having
the home ice.

01:59:49.354 --> 01:59:51.083
I'll be curious
to see that.

01:59:51.156 --> 01:59:53.853
-- Yeah, you and me both. Do
you need anything? -- No.

01:59:53.925 --> 01:59:56.087
'Cause I'm pretty behind
with this.

01:59:59.264 --> 02:00:02.234
So, you and Natalie --

02:00:02.300 --> 02:00:04.667
is this one of those things,
or is it real?

02:00:04.736 --> 02:00:06.704
We broke up,
if that's what you're asking.

02:00:06.772 --> 02:00:08.171
Yeah, but it
could blow over.

02:00:08.240 --> 02:00:10.174
It's not gonna
blow over today, so...

02:00:10.242 --> 02:00:11.505
Yeah.

02:00:11.576 --> 02:00:13.510
If you need any pointers,

02:00:13.578 --> 02:00:15.706
I've gotten very good
at being single.

02:00:15.781 --> 02:00:18.773
Nah, I appreciate it,
but I'm fine.

02:00:18.850 --> 02:00:21.785
I used to mind a lot,

02:00:21.853 --> 02:00:23.787
but now, not so much.

02:00:23.855 --> 02:00:25.880
I used to mind, uh...

02:00:25.957 --> 02:00:27.254
[Chuckles]

02:00:27.325 --> 02:00:29.259
...not being with a guy
after the show.

02:00:29.327 --> 02:00:31.762
That's when I'd always --

02:00:31.830 --> 02:00:33.264
I don't know why.

02:00:33.331 --> 02:00:37.700
Maybe it was because it was the
end of the day or maybe --

02:00:37.769 --> 02:00:42.536
You know,
you're the boss all day long,

02:00:42.607 --> 02:00:45.201
and you're barking out
these orders,

02:00:45.277 --> 02:00:48.440
and you just want --

02:00:51.950 --> 02:00:57.286
I don't know -- a check on your
femininity when you're done.

02:00:57.355 --> 02:01:01.792
Anyway, I don't mind being
alone anymore... you know?

02:01:01.860 --> 02:01:06.821
I go to sleep, and...the night's
over before you know it.

02:01:06.898 --> 02:01:09.868
Yeah, you know, you get home, you open
a can of spaghetti and meatballs --

02:01:09.935 --> 02:01:12.734
[Laughs ] A can
of spaghetti and meatballs?

02:01:12.804 --> 02:01:15.068
-- Yeah, like you heat up.
-- Yeah, like soup.

02:01:15.140 --> 02:01:17.074
-- Well, you don't add water.
-- Okay.

02:01:17.142 --> 02:01:18.473
Anyway...

02:01:18.543 --> 02:01:19.840
Home-ice advantage.

02:01:19.911 --> 02:01:21.140
I'll have it
in a half-hour?

02:01:21.213 --> 02:01:23.807
Okay.

02:01:23.882 --> 02:01:25.646
[Chuckles]

02:01:36.461 --> 02:01:38.930
[Tape unrolls]

02:01:42.067 --> 02:01:44.195
So...

02:01:46.304 --> 02:01:47.271
Yes?

02:01:47.339 --> 02:01:48.932
-- You're off.
-- Yep.

02:01:49.007 --> 02:01:50.532
-- <i>You going straight to the airport?</i>
-- Yeah.

02:01:50.609 --> 02:01:51.667
You could wait till
after the show, you know?

02:01:51.743 --> 02:01:53.541
I got to make the flight.

02:01:53.612 --> 02:01:55.842
There are flights to Chicago every hour.
We could book you on --

02:01:55.914 --> 02:01:57.780
I'm not going
to Chicago yet.

02:01:57.849 --> 02:01:59.078
-- <i>Where are you going?</i>
-- <i>Angkor Wat.</i>

02:01:59.151 --> 02:02:00.949
<i>-- Angkor Wm'?
-- Yeah.</i>

02:02:01.019 --> 02:02:02.783
-- <i>In Cambodia?</i>
-- <i>Yeah.</i>

02:02:02.854 --> 02:02:04.618
There's a television network
in Cambodia

02:02:04.689 --> 02:02:05.918
with ratings problems?

02:02:05.991 --> 02:02:09.757
[Chuckles] I'm taking
a week off first.

02:02:09.828 --> 02:02:11.922
Oh, you're vacationing
in Cambodia.

02:02:11.997 --> 02:02:13.260
Yes.

02:02:13.331 --> 02:02:15.231
I see.

02:02:15.300 --> 02:02:18.065
It's nice that we could
help out the police,

02:02:18.136 --> 02:02:19.570
don't you think?

02:02:19.638 --> 02:02:22.505
You could
take a flight tomorrow.

02:02:22.574 --> 02:02:24.565
I realize it would cut
your vacation short a day,

02:02:24.643 --> 02:02:28.739
but on the other hand,
it's one less day in Cambodia.

02:02:28.813 --> 02:02:30.281
You'd like Cambodia.

02:02:30.348 --> 02:02:32.442
I swear to God
I wouldn't.

02:02:35.787 --> 02:02:38.916
Dana, you know,
it -- it's just the way it is.

02:02:38.990 --> 02:02:42.221
It's -- it's the way it is.
I don't stick around places.

02:02:42.294 --> 02:02:44.228
I understand.
Look, your job, it --

02:02:44.296 --> 02:02:46.526
It's my job, yeah,
but it's me.

02:02:46.598 --> 02:02:48.896
I mean,
I make my job this way.

02:02:48.967 --> 02:02:51.902
I -- you wouldn't know it
to listen to me,

02:02:51.970 --> 02:02:54.371
but...l get attached --

02:02:54.439 --> 02:02:57.136
<i>is I think what happens --
to a place,</i>

02:02:57.209 --> 02:02:58.802
and then things change,

02:02:58.877 --> 02:03:01.710
and I have an adverse
reaction to that.

02:03:01.780 --> 02:03:04.943
So I sort of preemptively
change them myself.

02:03:05.016 --> 02:03:07.212
-- That's really sad, Sam.
-- <i>Hey,</i> you <i>know</i> what?

02:03:07.285 --> 02:03:10.949
I'm the guy that's got to live inside
of this thing 24 hours a day, so...

02:03:11.022 --> 02:03:12.285
Yeah.

02:03:12.357 --> 02:03:15.793
You did a really good job
while you were here.

02:03:15.860 --> 02:03:17.794
<i>I never gave you
enough credit for that.</i>

02:03:17.862 --> 02:03:19.387
Yeah, you did.

02:03:19.464 --> 02:03:21.091
And you're a good friend
to Isaac.

02:03:21.166 --> 02:03:22.531
So are you.

02:03:22.601 --> 02:03:24.695
[Chuckles]

02:03:30.942 --> 02:03:32.706
Stay tonight.

02:03:32.777 --> 02:03:34.609
I'll get a cake...

02:03:37.115 --> 02:03:39.550
...any kind of cake
you want...

02:03:39.618 --> 02:03:42.713
seriously.

02:03:42.787 --> 02:03:46.246
It's gonna be a long time
till I'm back here, Dana.

02:03:46.324 --> 02:03:48.554
Then stay tonight.

02:03:48.627 --> 02:03:50.425
Okay.

02:03:50.495 --> 02:03:52.088
-- Yeah?
-- Yeah.

02:03:52.163 --> 02:03:54.495
What kind of cake
do you want?

02:03:54.566 --> 02:03:55.499
Uh, w-whatever.

02:03:55.567 --> 02:03:56.500
Come on.

02:03:56.568 --> 02:03:57.899
What do you like?

02:03:57.969 --> 02:03:58.902
Strawberry.

02:03:58.970 --> 02:04:00.563
-- There you go.
-- [Chuckles]

02:04:07.646 --> 02:04:09.080
<i>Isaac.</i>

02:04:09.147 --> 02:04:10.740
Hey, Natalie.

02:04:10.815 --> 02:04:12.078
I know it's not my place,
but want to say

02:04:12.150 --> 02:04:13.640
I think it's terrible
you're handing over the tape.

02:04:13.718 --> 02:04:15.482
-- Why?
-- <i>You know why.</i>

02:04:15.553 --> 02:04:17.647
-- <i>Natalie...</i>
-- <i>We're</i> a <i>news organization.</i>

02:04:17.722 --> 02:04:19.349
I'm aware of that.

02:04:19.424 --> 02:04:21.153
Are you telling me the next
time someone calls us

02:04:21.226 --> 02:04:23.991
to tell us who's fixing college basketball,
we got to hand them to the police?

02:04:24.062 --> 02:04:25.496
-- No.
-- What are you saying?

02:04:25.563 --> 02:04:28.089
I'm saying we're handing <i>this</i>
over to the police.

02:04:28.166 --> 02:04:29.292
What's the difference?

02:04:29.367 --> 02:04:30.630
"Deep Throat"'s not
on that tape.

02:04:30.702 --> 02:04:32.534
There's no one
we need to protect.

02:04:32.604 --> 02:04:34.003
We shot a crime scene.

02:04:34.072 --> 02:04:35.870
We're helping out
the police.

02:04:35.940 --> 02:04:38.466
-- There's a bigger principle.
-- No, there's not.

02:04:38.543 --> 02:04:39.908
How about
the First Amendment?

02:04:39.978 --> 02:04:42.310
The First Amendment's
great, Natalie,

02:04:42.380 --> 02:04:45.714
but I don't think we need
to protect ourselves behind it

02:04:45.784 --> 02:04:47.013
just because we can.

02:04:47.085 --> 02:04:49.520
Well, I've said my piece.

02:04:49.587 --> 02:04:50.679
Natalie...

02:04:50.755 --> 02:04:51.779
Yeah?

02:04:51.856 --> 02:04:53.085
What's wrong?

02:04:53.158 --> 02:04:54.125
Nothing.

02:04:54.192 --> 02:04:56.126
What's wrong?

02:04:56.194 --> 02:04:58.219
I just -- I don't know -- maybe
journalism holds a romance --

02:04:58.296 --> 02:05:00.162
This isn't
about the tape.

02:05:00.231 --> 02:05:01.198
Yes, it is.

02:05:01.266 --> 02:05:03.064
Did you and Jeremy
have a fight?

02:05:03.134 --> 02:05:04.898
We broke up.

02:05:04.969 --> 02:05:05.959
I'm sorry to hear that.

02:05:06.037 --> 02:05:07.061
It's fine.

02:05:07.138 --> 02:05:08.628
Well, you two will
find your way back.

02:05:08.707 --> 02:05:09.902
No.

02:05:09.974 --> 02:05:11.499
Would you like to take
the night off?

02:05:11.576 --> 02:05:13.635
I'm not upset about this, Isaac. I'm
upset because there's a principle --

02:05:13.712 --> 02:05:15.806
a bedrock principle
that doesn't change --

02:05:15.880 --> 02:05:18.315
and now I'm supposed
to hand over these things.

02:05:18.383 --> 02:05:21.648
[Voice breaking] I'm supposed to hand
over these things that are ours.

02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:23.586

02:05:25.890 --> 02:05:28.154
It's okay.

02:05:28.226 --> 02:05:29.853
It's okay, baby.

This is a big step.

02:05:42.374 --> 02:05:43.569
Let's go.

02:05:43.641 --> 02:05:45.803

02:05:45.877 --> 02:05:46.867
Wow.

02:05:46.945 --> 02:05:47.878
-- Come on.
-- Very bright.

02:05:47.946 --> 02:05:49.004
Let's go.

02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:50.878
Danny, would you
give me a break?

02:05:50.949 --> 02:05:52.883
-- The whole room just went supernova.
-- We're late.

02:05:52.951 --> 02:05:55.318
-- Yeah, d-did they print the
script in -- in big type? -- Yes.

02:05:55.387 --> 02:05:56.912
-- Super-big?
-- Yes.

02:05:56.988 --> 02:05:59.184
I am not going to be able
to read off the TelePrompTer.

02:05:59.257 --> 02:06:00.554
Script's in big type-.

02:06:00.625 --> 02:06:02.252
[Exhales sharply] And I'm very
light sensitive right now.

02:06:02.327 --> 02:06:04.125
Well, it's a TV studio,
so I wouldn't worry about it.

02:06:04.229 --> 02:06:05.628
Yeah, well, my senses
are alive, Danny.

02:06:05.697 --> 02:06:07.062
You're about to walk
into a glass wall.

02:06:07.132 --> 02:06:09.294
-- I'm done with that now.
