WEBVTT

00:04.587 --> 00:08.383
(speaking German)

00:14.431 --> 00:16.016
(loud banging on door)
(gasps)

00:29.529 --> 00:31.197
Put the heaters away, boys.

00:31.239 --> 00:34.284
This guy's a scientist,
not a soldier.

00:34.325 --> 00:36.536
Now, toss the place
and find it.

00:41.166 --> 00:43.877
Before der Fuhrer
beats us to it.

00:47.172 --> 00:50.008
(chalk writing on chalkboard)

00:50.050 --> 00:51.634
ALARIC: I guess
the saying is true.

00:51.676 --> 00:53.094
Those who don't learn
from history

00:53.136 --> 00:55.096
are doomed to repeat it.

00:55.138 --> 00:58.349
LANDON: Actually, the original
quote is from George Santayana,

00:58.391 --> 01:00.685
who said, "Those who do not
remember the past

01:00.727 --> 01:02.729
are condemned to repeat it."

01:02.771 --> 01:05.273
Not that it really matters.

01:05.315 --> 01:06.816
(chuckles)

01:06.858 --> 01:09.486
It's good to have you
back, Landon.

01:09.527 --> 01:11.029
But the monsters are back, too.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.239
Yeah, I always miss
the good ones.

01:13.281 --> 01:15.366
Like, first there was the mummy,
and then, and then a minotaur,

01:15.408 --> 01:17.452
and now a leprechaun?

01:17.494 --> 01:20.205
What did it want?
We believe Malivore sent it

01:20.246 --> 01:21.956
to retrieve the Ascendant.
Makes sense.

01:21.998 --> 01:23.917
Malivore can't meatsuit me
if he's stuck in a prison world,

01:23.958 --> 01:25.293
so of course he wants
a way out.

01:25.335 --> 01:26.669
That's not happening
on my watch.

01:28.129 --> 01:31.549
Our watch.

01:31.591 --> 01:32.967
Landon's safe.

01:33.009 --> 01:35.512
But the rest of us...
not so much.

01:35.553 --> 01:38.139
It's like you said,
history repeating itself,

01:38.181 --> 01:41.017
doom... whatever.

01:41.059 --> 01:42.977
With the Ascendant destroyed,

01:43.019 --> 01:44.896
the monsters may be
after Landon now.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.689
So let's focus.

01:46.731 --> 01:48.733
After the leprechaun
came the Ferryman,

01:48.775 --> 01:50.693
which Cleo summoned
to bring you back home.

01:50.735 --> 01:53.571
Which is why I nominate Cleo
for the Super Squad.

01:53.613 --> 01:56.366
More like nominate yourself
into her pants.

01:56.407 --> 01:57.992
All in favor?

01:58.034 --> 01:59.744
We're not exactly
on great terms,

01:59.786 --> 02:00.995
but she brought
Landon back to me,

02:01.037 --> 02:02.997
so she has my vote.

02:03.039 --> 02:05.333
Well, that's a majority.
Motion passes.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.127
Is it? Where is everyone?

02:07.168 --> 02:09.754
Like, Josie and MG and, and...

02:09.796 --> 02:11.589
the rest of the students?

02:11.631 --> 02:15.844
Well, we've been having some
enrollment issues. (chuckles)

02:15.885 --> 02:18.805
Yet another reason to get this
monster problem all sorted out.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.515
Well, if history has
taught us anything,

02:20.557 --> 02:21.850
it's that we need to find
whatever portal they're coming

02:21.891 --> 02:23.476
out of and seal it up.
LIZZIE:
How?

02:23.518 --> 02:25.937
By stepping in every puddle
in town and seeing

02:25.979 --> 02:28.523
if we wind up in
an alternate hell dimension?

02:28.565 --> 02:30.567
ALARIC: Well, I'm glad you
asked, Elizabeth, because that's

02:30.608 --> 02:31.860
your assignment today.

02:31.901 --> 02:34.487
If Cleo can summon a monster,

02:34.529 --> 02:36.865
it stands to reason
she can summon another.

02:36.906 --> 02:38.658
Perhaps a harmless one
who will talk

02:38.700 --> 02:41.035
and give us answers
once we capture it.

02:41.077 --> 02:45.165
Now, I expect you all
to work together while I'm gone,

02:45.206 --> 02:46.499
harmoniously.

02:49.919 --> 02:53.298
Wait, where you going that's
more important than this?

02:53.339 --> 02:56.384
I'm going to see a supernatural
scholar about another lead.

02:56.426 --> 02:59.679
We will summon this monster
when I get back.

02:59.721 --> 03:03.308
Now, remember: harmoniously.

03:05.977 --> 03:07.645
JOSIE: I can't even look at you
right now.

03:07.687 --> 03:11.065
I mean, what kind
of mystery meat is that?

03:11.107 --> 03:13.776
I'm gonna be honest.
I'm not sure.

03:13.818 --> 03:16.362
But whatever it takes
to fit in

03:16.404 --> 03:18.531
on my first day.
Good luck.

03:18.573 --> 03:20.992
Mystic Falls is clique-ier
than The Salvatore School,

03:21.034 --> 03:23.494
which has actual factions.

03:23.536 --> 03:24.787
Over there is where
the jocks sit

03:24.829 --> 03:26.164
with the mean girl
cheerleaders.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.960
Well, she doesn't look
so mean to me.

03:31.002 --> 03:33.880
Tori Thompson? Please.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.256
The LARPers and comic book geeks
sit over there.

03:35.298 --> 03:36.674
It's probably more
your speed.

03:36.716 --> 03:39.719
Well, maybe at our last school,
but here,

03:39.761 --> 03:41.387
we can be as cool
as we want to be.

03:41.429 --> 03:44.098
How cool is that, exactly?

03:44.140 --> 03:46.309
I see myself trying out
for the football team...

03:46.351 --> 03:47.769
(female voices echoing)

03:47.810 --> 03:52.023
...because Tori Thompson is
totally into me.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.442
(laughs)

03:54.484 --> 03:56.110
Yeah, she just told her friend.

03:56.152 --> 03:58.071
Knock it off.
No vamp powers.

03:58.112 --> 03:59.989
Relax, they don't even know.

04:00.031 --> 04:01.658
Yeah, and we need to
keep it that way

04:01.699 --> 04:02.992
or my dad is going to
yank us out of this school

04:03.034 --> 04:04.744
so fast our heads
are gonna spin.

04:04.786 --> 04:07.413
Okay, he's probably lurking
in the parking lot right now.

04:07.455 --> 04:09.958
You're being paranoid.

04:09.999 --> 04:12.627
Please, just try being
human with me.

04:14.170 --> 04:17.340
Okay, fine. No powers.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.759
But if this place is
so important to you,

04:19.801 --> 04:22.595
why are we sitting here alone?

04:22.637 --> 04:24.555
Mind if I join you guys?

04:24.597 --> 04:25.848
Looks like there's
plenty of room.

04:25.890 --> 04:28.601
That'd be cool, right?
Yeah, sure.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.562
I'm MG.

04:31.604 --> 04:33.731
I remember, from that
flag football game.

04:33.773 --> 04:35.858
You transferred here, too?
Yeah.

04:35.900 --> 04:39.362
And, um, speaking of football,
I was thinking of trying out.

04:39.404 --> 04:41.531
You got any pointers?

04:44.617 --> 04:47.996
Uh, study hard instead.
I just got cut.

04:49.372 --> 04:51.708
LIZZIE:
I thought you were on my team.

04:51.749 --> 04:55.503
And I am, because your dad said
that we all need to

04:55.545 --> 04:57.171
work together on this one.

04:57.213 --> 04:58.798
Well, he's not here,

04:58.840 --> 05:01.009
and I am not working
with Hope Mikaelson.

05:01.050 --> 05:03.928
Lizzie, the last time we
went against Doc's plans,

05:03.970 --> 05:06.306
a leprechaun nearly killed him
with a necktie.

05:06.347 --> 05:08.308
Maybe ponder that for a sec.

05:08.349 --> 05:10.393
This is my pondering face, okay?

05:10.435 --> 05:12.520
And that plan was still way
better than the one

05:12.562 --> 05:14.689
that Hope came up with,
which could have sent Josie

05:14.731 --> 05:15.815
to the dark side.

05:15.857 --> 05:17.859
And at least
I'm doing something

05:17.900 --> 05:20.403
instead of moping around
because MG left.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.822
Okay, I can tell that
you're in a bad mood,

05:22.864 --> 05:24.115
so I'm gonna refrain
from pointing out

05:24.157 --> 05:25.158
your involvement in that, too.

05:25.199 --> 05:26.701
Besides,
MG's probably

05:26.743 --> 05:28.328
just out somewhere
taking a walk or something

05:28.369 --> 05:29.829
to blow some steam off.

05:29.871 --> 05:33.291
MG enrolled at Mystic Falls
this morning.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.794
He'll be staying
with Josie in town.

05:41.299 --> 05:45.053
Josie is his only friend there.
He'll be back in no time. Okay?

05:45.094 --> 05:46.512
I hope so.

05:46.554 --> 05:48.431
Because, as your new bestie,

05:48.473 --> 05:50.391
you mooning over his comic books

05:50.433 --> 05:51.809
is a little creepy.

05:51.851 --> 05:54.187
Yeah, this is research.

05:54.228 --> 05:55.688
Oh, yes.

05:55.730 --> 05:59.400
The adventures of
trench coat guy and Tinker Bell.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.361
First off, that's
John Constantine,

06:01.402 --> 06:02.403
and you damn well know it.

06:02.445 --> 06:04.364
Second, that
is a pixie.

06:04.405 --> 06:07.909
A kinder, gentler version
of a genie...
(laughs)

06:07.950 --> 06:11.037
As if genies even exist.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.747
...that trades wishes
for favors.

06:12.789 --> 06:15.249
So all we gotta do is
a solid for one of 'em,

06:15.291 --> 06:18.378
wish for them
to close the portal as payback.

06:18.419 --> 06:21.756
Our Malivore problem
is done and dusted. Boom.

06:26.719 --> 06:28.763
Oh, damn.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.057
That's that little ponder face
you were talking about.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.017
What are you thinking?

06:33.059 --> 06:35.478
It's classified.

06:36.437 --> 06:37.814
LANDON:
I thought we were supposed

06:37.855 --> 06:40.316
to be working with
Lizzie and Kaleb.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.487
What is that?

06:44.529 --> 06:47.281
The note Lizzie left
on the door to her room.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.868
Hey, are you okay?

06:50.910 --> 06:54.205
I mean, I've been picking up
on some weird tension.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.289
Never better.

06:55.331 --> 06:56.582
I've got you back.

06:56.624 --> 06:58.042
That's all that matters anyway.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.629
I'm not sure Lizzie
feels the same.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.631
Yeah. I may have tried
to guilt Josie

07:03.673 --> 07:05.341
into taking her magic back

07:05.383 --> 07:06.926
to open a door
to save you,

07:06.968 --> 07:09.053
but it didn't even happen,
so I don't know why

07:09.095 --> 07:10.680
Lizzie's so bent out of shape.

07:10.721 --> 07:12.723
Well, how would you have felt if
it had been me in danger

07:12.765 --> 07:14.016
instead of Josie?
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:14.058 --> 07:15.268
Whose side are you on?

07:15.309 --> 07:17.395
Yours. Always.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.188
I'm just saying

07:19.230 --> 07:21.482
the reason you two are mad
at each other is because

07:21.524 --> 07:22.525
you're more alike
than you think.

07:22.567 --> 07:24.193
Take that back immediately.

07:24.235 --> 07:26.195
You're both smart,
powerful witches

07:26.237 --> 07:29.240
who'd do just about anything
for who or what you love.

07:30.741 --> 07:32.910
I really hope you're wrong,
because if you're right,

07:32.952 --> 07:34.787
I think I know what Lizzie's
about to do next.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.465
I was unaware
you jogged, Lizzie.

07:45.506 --> 07:47.175
I'm, uh, more of
a night runner.

07:47.216 --> 07:49.969
It's normally so dark, in fact,
that you can't even see me.

07:50.011 --> 07:51.929
Well, I always sprint
the last mile.

07:51.971 --> 07:53.473
No pressure to keep up.
Wait!

07:53.514 --> 07:56.642
And leave your mentor
in the dust?

07:56.684 --> 07:58.478
I'm here to officially
welcome you--

07:58.519 --> 08:02.064
Sculptress of Statuary,
Slayer of Small Ones--

08:02.106 --> 08:04.859
as a member-elect
of the Super Squad.

08:04.901 --> 08:07.862
Thank you... I think.

08:09.071 --> 08:10.490
What is expected of me?

08:10.531 --> 08:13.659
Merely one super-heroic event,

08:13.701 --> 08:17.205
as approved by your
Super Squad mentor.

08:17.246 --> 08:18.539
Meaning you.
Yes.

08:18.581 --> 08:21.125
So lucky, right?

08:21.167 --> 08:23.920
And I've already thought
of just the thing.

08:23.961 --> 08:25.463
HOPE:
And I bet I know what that is.

08:32.887 --> 08:35.056
You were gonna summon
a monster behind my back?

08:35.097 --> 08:36.682
Please. Like you
weren't planning on

08:36.724 --> 08:38.184
doing the same thing.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.685
And knowing you,
you would have released

08:39.727 --> 08:42.063
a Kraken with a Muppet allergy

08:42.104 --> 08:43.272
that would have wiped
out the rest of us.

08:43.314 --> 08:44.649
Okay, unlike you,

08:44.690 --> 08:46.692
I actually listened
to your father,

08:46.734 --> 08:48.986
so I was thinking cute,
talking, harmless.

08:49.028 --> 08:50.738
Well, why don't you share
with the rest of the class?

08:50.780 --> 08:51.864
Why don't we summon a cherub?

08:51.906 --> 08:53.658
They're basically
flying babies.

08:53.699 --> 08:54.700
LIZZIE:
With bows and arrows.

08:54.742 --> 08:57.203
Cupid was a total bloodbath.

08:57.245 --> 08:58.412
Remember?

08:58.454 --> 08:59.872
Um, he wasn't actually Cupid,

08:59.914 --> 09:00.915
and shouldn't we just wait
for Dr. Saltzman?

09:00.957 --> 09:02.166
BOTH:
Stay out of this!

09:02.208 --> 09:03.668
It doesn't matter
who he was,

09:03.709 --> 09:06.837
because pixies
grant wishes.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.464
Okay, so does a monkey's paw.
How would that work out?

09:08.506 --> 09:10.716
You'll see.
Fire up that summoning spell.

09:10.758 --> 09:13.177
I do not believe
that will be necessary.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.096
The monster is already here.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.017
(growling)

09:20.059 --> 09:21.727
(purring)

09:21.769 --> 09:24.480
Oh, that is the cutest
monster ever.

09:24.522 --> 09:25.690
(babbling)

09:25.731 --> 09:27.650
(giggling)

09:27.692 --> 09:29.318
What is it?
I don't know.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.861
But I want one.

09:30.903 --> 09:33.281
(purring, chuckling)

09:40.329 --> 09:43.165
Did you summon that thing?
No.

09:43.207 --> 09:45.126
We must be wary.

09:45.167 --> 09:47.420
(sneezes)
LIZZIE:
More like merry.

09:47.461 --> 09:50.881
This thing could check
all of our boxes.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.341
Now, somebody, quick,
throw a blanket over it

09:52.383 --> 09:53.759
and we'll find out
if it can talk.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.177
(high-pitched voice):
Screw you.

09:56.387 --> 09:57.763
How's that for talking?

09:57.805 --> 09:59.348
Grab it.

09:59.390 --> 10:00.891
(laughing)

10:05.396 --> 10:07.607
MONSTSER:
Too slow. Too slow!

10:07.648 --> 10:09.692
(monster laughs maniacally)

10:10.651 --> 10:12.069
Are you sure it went
this way?

10:12.111 --> 10:13.779
Yes, Hope, I can hear it.

10:13.821 --> 10:16.407
Are you two deaf and dumb?

10:16.449 --> 10:18.451
Let's see if the thing is as
fireproof as it is critical.

10:18.492 --> 10:20.161
HOPE:
No, don't.
See where these pipes lead?

10:20.202 --> 10:22.204
MONSTER:
Okey-dokey. Just dumb. (laughs)

10:22.246 --> 10:23.497
Regrettably,
you're right.

10:23.539 --> 10:25.499
We need a song of ice
and not fire.

10:25.541 --> 10:27.126
A quick Glae Solidatur

10:27.168 --> 10:29.629
will freeze this little guy
in his tracks.

10:29.670 --> 10:31.547
HOPE:
We want to interrogate it,
not kill it.

10:31.589 --> 10:33.341
Remember?
I'll just cast immobilus.

10:33.382 --> 10:35.259
Oh, great,
so it can drown in there.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.180
(monster coughing)

10:39.221 --> 10:40.389
Once again, Hope,

10:40.431 --> 10:42.600
this is all your fault...

10:42.642 --> 10:44.644
Yah! (squeaks)

10:46.562 --> 10:48.731
MONSTER:
Smell you later, ladies...
Damn it.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.566
(monster giggling)
Here. Let me help.

10:52.526 --> 10:53.653
Like I've been saying all day,

10:53.694 --> 10:56.530
I don't want your help.

10:56.572 --> 10:58.449
I can't believe that you would
push me in here.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.451
I didn't.
It was the monster.

11:00.493 --> 11:01.994
You know what, Hope?

11:02.036 --> 11:04.288
At least when I'm a bitch,

11:04.330 --> 11:06.666
I own it.

11:06.707 --> 11:08.250
Now, for the last time,

11:08.292 --> 11:10.294
stay the hell out of my way.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.006
People always get hurt
when you don't.

11:15.591 --> 11:17.802
ALARIC: I really
appreciate your help.

11:17.843 --> 11:20.846
Whatever you can do
to identify that would be great.

11:20.888 --> 11:22.640
Anything for an old pal.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.767
Especially the one
who helped me get this gig.

11:24.809 --> 11:25.893
You deserve it.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.603
How's, uh...

11:27.645 --> 11:29.939
how's Emma?
Oh, we're solid.

11:29.980 --> 11:32.692
Yeah. At least we will be

11:32.733 --> 11:35.194
once she wraps up
this semester in Shanghai.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.529
Ah.

11:36.570 --> 11:39.615
Mac?
Mm...

11:40.658 --> 11:43.911
Do I even want to know why
you're interested in this?

11:43.953 --> 11:45.871
Well, we think
Malivore opened up

11:45.913 --> 11:47.373
another portal somehow.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.125
Monsters started appearing

11:49.166 --> 11:51.335
once Hope and I opened up
that artifact,

11:51.377 --> 11:53.087
and I just want to know
if it's a coincidence

11:53.129 --> 11:56.424
or a... you know,
cause for concern.

11:56.465 --> 11:59.176
I'll give you a call
as soon as I have information.

12:04.390 --> 12:07.935
Unless y-you'd prefer
to stick around.

12:07.977 --> 12:11.021
(chuckles) Why would
I want to do that?

12:11.063 --> 12:12.481
(chuckles)

12:12.523 --> 12:14.692
Because you could've
sent me photos

12:14.734 --> 12:16.694
of this thing, Rick,
and called.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.447
Your daughter
goes here

12:19.488 --> 12:21.323
and now so does MG.

12:21.365 --> 12:23.075
So, like you said--

12:23.117 --> 12:25.953
coincidence
or cause for concern?

12:27.621 --> 12:29.790
I wish I knew.

12:29.832 --> 12:32.543
Josie came in contact
with black magic.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.670
Now, she checks out fine,
but, you know,

12:34.712 --> 12:36.756
black magic can be tricky.

12:38.340 --> 12:40.760
I hate the idea
of spying on her,

12:40.801 --> 12:43.345
but, uh...

12:43.387 --> 12:46.056
what do you have in mind?

12:47.516 --> 12:50.478
I had a teacher
call in sick this morning.

12:50.519 --> 12:52.605
I need a substitute.

12:53.898 --> 12:55.441
Well...

12:55.483 --> 12:59.403
my human history's a...
a little rusty, but...

12:59.445 --> 13:00.905
(chuckles)

13:00.946 --> 13:03.657
Who said it was history class?

13:03.699 --> 13:05.785
(whistle blows)

13:06.994 --> 13:08.788
ALARIC:
All right. Let's, um,

13:08.829 --> 13:11.373
stretch the ham... hammies.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.464
(sighs)

13:18.506 --> 13:20.257
Paranoid, huh?

13:20.299 --> 13:24.345
Your dad has questionable timing

13:24.386 --> 13:27.306
and extremely
questionable taste

13:27.348 --> 13:29.517
in athletic apparel.
But h-he's not...

13:29.558 --> 13:32.478
A total spy?

13:32.520 --> 13:33.979
That's fine. He can
spy all he wants

13:34.021 --> 13:35.397
if there's nothing
for him to see.

13:35.439 --> 13:38.526
So no using vamp
speed or strength

13:38.567 --> 13:41.237
to impress
Tori-Crop-Top-Thompson

13:41.278 --> 13:42.780
with your
soccer skills.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.156
Promise?

13:48.327 --> 13:50.329
(grunts softly)

13:50.371 --> 13:51.747
(whispers):
Stop looking.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.541
It's really hard. Okay.
Stop looking.

13:53.582 --> 13:54.834
HOPE:
Too short.

13:55.918 --> 13:58.712
Too green.
Mm.

13:58.754 --> 14:00.130
Too Gimli.

14:00.172 --> 14:02.091
(gasps) You remembered.

14:02.132 --> 14:03.425
(laughs)

14:03.467 --> 14:05.719
That's a lawn ornament.
This is pointless.

14:05.761 --> 14:07.513
No, it's a process.
There are literally

14:07.555 --> 14:09.640
thousands of wee folk
in mythology.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.517
We just have to figure
out what this one is.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.477
It would go a lot faster if we
could share notes with Lizzie.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.104
Not an option.

14:15.145 --> 14:16.939
Apparently, I'm hazardous
to everyone's health.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.440
Okay.

14:18.482 --> 14:20.734
Radical idea,
I know.

14:20.776 --> 14:22.820
Have you thought
about apologizing

14:22.862 --> 14:25.364
to her for pressuring Josie?
I can't.

14:25.406 --> 14:27.157
And not because I don't want to.

14:27.199 --> 14:30.077
But because if you
disappeared tomorrow,

14:30.119 --> 14:32.162
I'd do it all over again.

14:32.204 --> 14:34.039
Well, what brought me back was
something you hadn't thought of.

14:34.081 --> 14:36.709
And I bet if you
and Lizzie had worked together,

14:36.750 --> 14:38.168
you'd have found another way.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.753
Yeah, but we didn't.

14:39.795 --> 14:41.213
And I can't change the past.
Fair.

14:41.255 --> 14:42.548
But you can change the present.

14:42.590 --> 14:43.799
Starting with our current

14:43.841 --> 14:45.885
adorable little
monster...

14:45.926 --> 14:47.511
LIZZIE (over P.A.):
Good morning, Stallions.

14:47.553 --> 14:51.265
This is The Salvatore School
Monster Warning Service.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.642
There's yet another monster
on the loose,

14:53.684 --> 14:56.061
but more on that later.

14:56.103 --> 15:00.941
Because the true threat to all
our lives is Hope Mikaelson.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.485
And not just 'cause
she has scabies.

15:03.527 --> 15:05.946
(laughing maniacally)

15:12.161 --> 15:14.705
Gotta go easy
on that arm.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.750
Oh, that's right,
I need to.

15:17.791 --> 15:21.128
Unless you need a Band-Aid
for that cut, QB None.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.296
Oh, knock it off, Blake.

15:22.338 --> 15:23.714
We can't all go 12 seasons

15:23.756 --> 15:25.299
without taking a snap like you.

15:25.341 --> 15:28.010
It's only been three.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.304
Who am I to question your math?

15:30.346 --> 15:32.139
Yeah, go ahead, bail.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.807
Like you bailed on your family.

15:33.849 --> 15:35.309
Worked out great.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.271
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Break it up, break it up.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.398
Break it up, break it up.
Break it up.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.275
All right, everyone go take

15:43.317 --> 15:45.027
a couple laps
around the school. Go!

15:46.820 --> 15:48.197
Not you.

15:48.238 --> 15:49.531
Go pick up
some of those cones

15:49.573 --> 15:50.950
and cool off.

15:53.494 --> 15:55.329
(grunts)

15:55.371 --> 15:57.748
After you go pick that up.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.333
Go on, move.

16:01.752 --> 16:03.212
JOSIE: What was
that about?

16:03.253 --> 16:04.672
I don't know,
you tell me.

16:04.713 --> 16:07.132
JOSIE: I don't know.
Everything's fine here.

16:07.174 --> 16:09.593
Better than fine, actually.
It's perfect.
Huh.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.261
Well, it doesn't seem
that way to me.

16:12.888 --> 16:14.431
Ethan got cut from
the football team

16:14.473 --> 16:15.849
and he's messed
up about it.

16:17.017 --> 16:18.102
(horn blares)

16:22.690 --> 16:24.191
(horn blaring)

16:27.152 --> 16:29.029
Holy crap.

16:29.071 --> 16:31.699
How did you just move that fast?

16:33.909 --> 16:35.411
HOPE:
I cannot believe you.

16:35.452 --> 16:36.954
Scabies? Really?

16:36.996 --> 16:38.747
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

16:38.789 --> 16:40.916
I was too busy washing
the chlorine out of my hair.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.918
Though I can't say I disagree
with the spirit of the message.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.586
Okay, let's do this.

16:44.628 --> 16:46.714
I've saved you and this
school over a dozen times.

16:46.755 --> 16:48.799
And how many times
have you put us all

16:48.841 --> 16:50.384
in grave,
life-threatening danger?

16:50.426 --> 16:52.136
It's a wash, Hope.

16:52.177 --> 16:53.178
And the truth is,

16:53.220 --> 16:54.221
you're only there for us

16:54.263 --> 16:55.389
when you need something.

16:55.431 --> 16:56.974
HOPE: Look,
I'm not proud

16:57.016 --> 16:58.851
of what I asked Josie to do,
but let's be real:

16:58.892 --> 17:00.394
you're the reason she went dark
in the first place.

17:00.436 --> 17:02.312
LANDON:
Ding, ding. Round over.

17:02.354 --> 17:04.189
Everyone back
to a neutral corner.

17:04.231 --> 17:06.775
You two are not
making any sense.

17:06.817 --> 17:08.235
Okay. Butt out, new girl.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.696
You have no idea how deep
our history goes.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.406
CLEO:
That is correct.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.450
Which is why I am taking
both of you at your word.

17:14.491 --> 17:15.868
If Hope says

17:15.909 --> 17:17.202
she did not push
Lizzie into the pool,

17:17.244 --> 17:18.704
then I believe her.

17:18.746 --> 17:20.205
And if Lizzie

17:20.247 --> 17:21.790
swears she did not make
that announcement,

17:21.832 --> 17:23.375
then I believe her, too.

17:23.417 --> 17:24.585
But we heard her voice.

17:24.626 --> 17:25.711
CLEO: Perhaps
we should focus

17:25.753 --> 17:27.337
on that fact.

17:27.379 --> 17:29.256
And an explanation for it
that does not require

17:29.298 --> 17:30.507
either of you
to be wrong.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.176
The monster.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.304
Sounds like I'm here
right on time.

17:35.345 --> 17:36.472
Critter was just
in Doc's office.

17:36.513 --> 17:37.681
LIZZIE:
God, you will do anything

17:37.723 --> 17:39.683
to suck up to Cleo.

17:40.934 --> 17:42.561
Killing monsters
does not impress me.

17:42.603 --> 17:43.729
HOPE: No, he
didn't kill it.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.105
It's molting.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.774
What kind of creature
does that?

17:46.815 --> 17:48.358
LIZZIE:
Butterflies?

17:48.400 --> 17:49.818
Frogs?
Gremlins.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.987
Oh, it is definitely
a gremlin.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.447
Oh, awesome.

17:53.489 --> 17:55.199
Finally. (laughs)

17:55.240 --> 17:57.076
I mean, I mean...

18:04.249 --> 18:06.668
LIZZIE:
I don't get it.

18:06.710 --> 18:08.087
How does something so cute

18:08.128 --> 18:09.838
become this?

18:09.880 --> 18:12.341
Duh.
Feeding them after midnight.

18:16.261 --> 18:17.679
Oh, come on.
You've never seen...

18:17.721 --> 18:19.556
Disrespect.

18:19.598 --> 18:22.017
Says it right here, nerd.

18:22.059 --> 18:23.268
That's what gremlins feed on.

18:23.310 --> 18:24.770
Okay, well, then the movie--

18:24.812 --> 18:26.230
which you all still
should have seen--

18:26.271 --> 18:28.273
obviously took
some artistic license.

18:28.315 --> 18:31.610
Perhaps it is pitting the two
of you against one another.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.488
Great.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.865
We've been feeding it
an all-you-can-eat buffet.

18:36.907 --> 18:38.951
The stronger it gets,
the more dangerous it is.

18:38.992 --> 18:41.203
For Landon, right?

18:42.079 --> 18:43.413
Wait, that's it.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.207
If we want
to trap this thing,

18:45.249 --> 18:46.834
we have the
perfect bait.

18:46.875 --> 18:48.919
Do not look at my boyfriend
like he's a piece of cheese.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.087
We are not...
Using me as bait

18:50.129 --> 18:51.088
is a great idea.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.422
I mean,

18:52.464 --> 18:54.341
if Malivore wants me,
like always,

18:54.383 --> 18:56.009
then the gremlin has no choice
but to come for me, right?

18:56.051 --> 18:58.554
And we'll be waiting
when it does.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.474
Look, the only way
this goes wrong

19:02.516 --> 19:04.143
is if you two can't
work together.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.437
It's all up to you two.

19:08.272 --> 19:09.982
ALARIC:
This isn't about us, MG.

19:10.023 --> 19:12.359
It's about
what's best for Ethan.
Is it?

19:12.401 --> 19:15.028
Or is it more like keeping our
secrets safe at his expense?

19:15.070 --> 19:16.780
JOSIE:
Burdening Ethan with it

19:16.822 --> 19:18.407
won't end well, either.
Dad's right.

19:18.448 --> 19:19.992
We can't risk it.
No offense,

19:20.033 --> 19:22.536
Jo. But what are you
really worried about risking?

19:23.453 --> 19:25.330
Do I get a vote?

19:26.540 --> 19:29.168
Well, this isn't a democracy.

19:29.209 --> 19:31.044
But we can hear what
you have to say.

19:31.086 --> 19:33.672
I think it's really cool that
MG has superpowers, because...

19:34.882 --> 19:36.049
...I'd be dead without them.

19:36.091 --> 19:37.092
And I understand
why you'd want

19:37.134 --> 19:38.302
to keep that a secret.

19:38.343 --> 19:39.511
And I'm happy to keep it.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.138
ALARIC: Yes,
I believe you.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.681
But I made your mother a promise

19:42.723 --> 19:44.308
that I'd look after you
and keep you safe.

19:44.349 --> 19:45.642
MG?

19:45.684 --> 19:47.144
Please compel him.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.312
That's my
decision.

19:48.353 --> 19:50.189
Compel me to do what?

19:50.230 --> 19:51.773
There's no reason to be scared.

19:51.815 --> 19:53.108
You had a bad day.

19:53.150 --> 19:55.444
You got cut
from the football team

19:55.485 --> 19:56.653
and you're
mad about it,

19:56.695 --> 19:58.947
so you went home
after gym class.

19:58.989 --> 20:01.074
But you're gonna wake up
tomorrow feeling better.

20:01.116 --> 20:02.659
And you're gonna find
what makes you happy

20:02.701 --> 20:04.328
that's not football,

20:04.369 --> 20:06.788
then go after it.

20:06.830 --> 20:08.582
But you're not going
to remember this conversation

20:08.624 --> 20:10.417
or anything that
happened with us today.

20:13.086 --> 20:14.504
I feel better already.

20:15.297 --> 20:17.466
I don't remember a thing.

20:18.967 --> 20:22.095
So you don't remember the thing
you're not supposed to remember?

20:25.766 --> 20:27.935
Is there any possibility

20:27.976 --> 20:30.479
that you told his mom
about vervain?

20:33.065 --> 20:34.650
Mm.

20:34.691 --> 20:36.401
Yeah.
Son of a bitch.

20:36.443 --> 20:38.862
CLEO:
This is quite intense.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.280
At least the dude's little.

20:40.322 --> 20:42.074
Minotaurs,
gargoyles,

20:42.115 --> 20:43.450
Headless Horseman--

20:43.492 --> 20:45.202
that's when the real intensity
kicks in.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.620
Hey.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.914
It's okay.

20:48.956 --> 20:50.540
You get used to it.

20:50.582 --> 20:52.042
I do not want to.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.920
I thought this school
was perfect for me--

20:54.962 --> 20:58.257
secure, enlightened, creative.

20:58.298 --> 20:59.925
But now I am unsure

20:59.967 --> 21:01.426
if I wish to be a member
of your Squad.

21:01.468 --> 21:02.594
Look, I used
to feel

21:02.636 --> 21:04.554
the same way about this place.

21:04.596 --> 21:07.683
Just take it from me: don't
let fear drive you away from...

21:07.724 --> 21:09.226
something good.

21:11.728 --> 21:14.648
Uh, especially when you don't
have anything to be afraid of.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.692
From what you have
all told me,

21:16.733 --> 21:19.403
Malivore is terrifying.

21:19.444 --> 21:21.280
So explain how

21:21.321 --> 21:23.115
I'm supposed to feel safe.

21:29.454 --> 21:31.373
Uh...

21:31.415 --> 21:32.749
Uh, maybe I, uh...

21:32.791 --> 21:34.418
just...

21:34.459 --> 21:37.796
totally misread
that whole situation. I'm...

21:37.838 --> 21:39.840
sorry.

21:39.881 --> 21:42.467
Ask again when our lives
are not in jeopardy.

21:47.055 --> 21:48.849
I'm gonna go

21:48.890 --> 21:52.102
get, uh, uh, another...
another book.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.479
Yeah. Okay.

21:57.065 --> 21:59.109
(growling)

22:00.110 --> 22:01.445
HOPE:
It's here.

22:01.486 --> 22:02.904
Then you were right.

22:02.946 --> 22:05.407
You can use gremlin goo
to cast a locator spell.

22:05.449 --> 22:07.242
All the more reason
to moisturize.

22:07.284 --> 22:09.786
It's on the move. Get ready.

22:18.086 --> 22:20.964
I don't mean to interrupt this
awesome teamwork on display,

22:21.006 --> 22:22.674
but where do you need me,
exactly?

22:22.716 --> 22:23.925
Anywhere is fine.

22:23.967 --> 22:25.552
If you really
wanted to help,

22:25.594 --> 22:28.305
you could slather yourself
in honey.

22:32.225 --> 22:34.978
Uh, it doesn't matter.
It's not coming.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.104
What do you mean?

22:38.565 --> 22:40.942
He's right.
It's headed off-campus.

22:40.984 --> 22:42.986
Oh, great.
You screwed up the spell.
The spell worked just fine.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.279
Your attitude,
on the other hand?

22:44.321 --> 22:46.073
Disrespect.

22:46.114 --> 22:48.241
Remember?
Well, maybe
it ate so much

22:48.283 --> 22:49.993
it's full.

22:51.787 --> 22:53.914
Or Malivore's not after Landon.

22:53.955 --> 22:54.956
Then who the hell

22:54.998 --> 22:56.500
does he want?

22:56.541 --> 22:58.001
(door opens)

22:58.043 --> 23:00.253
The gremlin--
the gremlin took Cleo.

23:06.718 --> 23:08.595
Put that down.
You're not coming.

23:08.637 --> 23:10.180
Like hell. Cleo got grabbed on
my watch. I'm getting her back.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.391
LIZZIE:
So you guys
uncovered how to

23:12.432 --> 23:14.267
incapacitate/murder a gremlin

23:14.309 --> 23:16.603
prior to her
being kidnapped?

23:16.645 --> 23:18.021
No, but I will.
Personally.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.523
Okay, who's
gonna stay here

23:19.564 --> 23:21.233
and keep an eye on the school?
You mean Landon.

23:21.274 --> 23:23.110
You miss the part where I suck
at protecting people?

23:23.151 --> 23:24.528
LANDON:
Kaleb's right.

23:24.569 --> 23:25.821
Not about the sucking.

23:25.862 --> 23:27.531
And before you tell me
why I'm wrong,

23:27.572 --> 23:29.241
there are, like, four other
students at this school

23:29.282 --> 23:30.784
and the monster isn't
after me for once.

23:30.826 --> 23:33.203
I don't need protection.

23:33.245 --> 23:34.371
So let me handle
the research

23:34.413 --> 23:35.539
while the three of you

23:35.580 --> 23:37.666
handle finding Cleo together.

23:37.707 --> 23:39.084
Because doing things the way
you have been doing them

23:39.126 --> 23:40.961
is exactly what
the gremlin wants.

23:42.546 --> 23:44.005
ETHAN:
Found it.

23:45.173 --> 23:46.550
My mom said

23:46.591 --> 23:47.926
it's an herbal supplement
to help with my arm.

23:47.968 --> 23:49.428
She sends me the stuff
all the time.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.434
(MG grunts)

23:55.475 --> 23:56.852
Mm. Yeah.

23:56.893 --> 23:58.770
That... Mm.

23:58.812 --> 24:00.647
That stings like vervain.

24:00.689 --> 24:03.316
Holy crap, is vervain
your kryptonite?

24:03.358 --> 24:04.693
ALARIC:
When was the last time

24:04.734 --> 24:05.777
you took one of those pills?

24:05.819 --> 24:07.237
Uh, this morning,

24:07.279 --> 24:08.864
before I worked out,
around 6:00.

24:08.905 --> 24:10.740
A dose that size,

24:10.782 --> 24:12.325
it should be out of your system

24:12.367 --> 24:14.077
in a couple of hours.
Then you and MG can try

24:14.119 --> 24:16.455
having that, uh,
conversation again.

24:16.496 --> 24:17.831
If something different
than that happens,

24:17.873 --> 24:19.332
give me a call.

24:21.084 --> 24:22.377
Where are you going?

24:23.962 --> 24:26.631
I think you and I need
to talk privately.

24:26.673 --> 24:28.758
(door opens)

24:34.806 --> 24:36.016
(door closes)

24:36.057 --> 24:37.476
ETHAN:
I guess we got
time to kill.

24:37.517 --> 24:40.854
Might as well tell me
your origin story.

24:40.896 --> 24:43.315
Uh, I don't think
that's a good idea.

24:43.356 --> 24:44.816
Why not?

24:44.858 --> 24:47.861
You're just gonna wipe
my memory anyway, right?

24:47.903 --> 24:49.446
Kind of like how

24:49.488 --> 24:52.449
Zatanna mind-wiped Batman.
(scoffs)

24:53.533 --> 24:57.329
In Identity Crisis
issue number six.

24:57.370 --> 24:58.997
Yeah.

24:59.039 --> 25:00.332
Hold on.

25:00.373 --> 25:01.958
Hold on, hold on.
(laughs)

25:02.000 --> 25:03.960
How'd you know?

25:04.002 --> 25:06.046
All right, look,

25:06.087 --> 25:08.006
I would never admit this
to anyone, but...

25:08.048 --> 25:09.841
I've loved comic books
since I was a kid.

25:09.883 --> 25:10.926
Wow. (laughs)

25:10.967 --> 25:12.719
It's our secret, all right?

25:12.761 --> 25:14.721
(both laugh)

25:15.639 --> 25:18.308
This should be the spot.

25:18.350 --> 25:21.353
Great. A literal cow pasture.

25:21.394 --> 25:22.729
But, hey, pun intended.

25:22.771 --> 25:24.064
That's supposed to be
good luck, right?

25:24.105 --> 25:25.649
KALEB:
Pipe down
for a sec, Lizzie.

25:25.690 --> 25:27.400
(indistinct sounds)
You hear that?

25:28.318 --> 25:30.278
Of course you can't.

25:31.238 --> 25:33.365
Cleo!
(grunts)

25:33.406 --> 25:35.075
Hold on, okay?

25:38.161 --> 25:39.704
Nice work.
Yeah.

25:39.746 --> 25:41.540
Dissero.

25:45.293 --> 25:47.045
Cleo, we can levitate you
out of there.

25:49.756 --> 25:51.800
I said "we."
Doesn't this all seem

25:51.841 --> 25:53.009
a bit too easy?

25:53.051 --> 25:54.302
If I were a gremlin,

25:54.344 --> 25:55.220
why would I leave Cleo
in a place

25:55.262 --> 25:56.137
that is so quick to find?

25:56.179 --> 25:57.305
KALEB:
Who cares?

25:57.347 --> 25:59.140
Maybe gremlins are dumb.
Or smart.

25:59.182 --> 26:00.725
Or at least, as smart as we are.

26:00.767 --> 26:02.102
I mean, it used Cleo as bait.

26:02.143 --> 26:03.186
Just like we did with Landon.

26:03.228 --> 26:04.521
You think?

26:04.563 --> 26:06.731
(distant thudding)

26:08.191 --> 26:10.277
(growling)

26:13.863 --> 26:15.782
Call it a gut feeling.

26:15.824 --> 26:18.076
(high-pitched roaring)

26:18.118 --> 26:20.245
Fools!

26:25.792 --> 26:27.419
(screeching)

26:27.460 --> 26:28.753
How is it so big?

26:28.795 --> 26:30.922
We've been kumbaya
since Landon's speech.

26:30.964 --> 26:32.507
CLEO:
It is my fault.

26:32.549 --> 26:34.426
I may have used
some colorful language

26:34.467 --> 26:35.760
as it dragged me here.

26:42.434 --> 26:45.562
Like they say,
the bigger they are...

26:53.820 --> 26:55.947
So, what's plan B?
(horn honking)

27:02.287 --> 27:03.371
(car door opens)

27:03.413 --> 27:05.498
(roars)

27:05.540 --> 27:06.625
No way.

27:07.876 --> 27:09.753
He's like Gremzilla now!

27:09.794 --> 27:12.088
And far less frightening than
I will be if you have scratched

27:12.130 --> 27:13.131
my paint.

27:13.173 --> 27:14.507
Focus, guys.

27:14.549 --> 27:16.176
I figured out how to
defeat the gremlin.

27:16.217 --> 27:18.428
Disrespect makes
the gremlin stronger,

27:18.470 --> 27:20.055
and respect weakens it.

27:20.096 --> 27:21.931
In hindsight, actually
makes a lot of sense.

27:21.973 --> 27:23.224
Probably shouldn't have
taken hours of research.

27:23.266 --> 27:24.726
So we have to respect
each other?

27:25.769 --> 27:28.271
Ha. We're doomed.

27:29.189 --> 27:30.732
You're a vampire?

27:30.774 --> 27:33.193
Now, it's nowhere near as dope
as getting bitten

27:33.234 --> 27:35.945
by some radioactive bat
or anything, but, uh,

27:35.987 --> 27:38.823
yeah, it's the truth.

27:38.865 --> 27:41.785
It's still cool as hell.
Super strength?

27:41.826 --> 27:44.621
Super speed? The blood
thing is a bit of a bummer,

27:44.663 --> 27:46.790
but the only bad part
was your mom and dad

27:46.831 --> 27:49.125
not accepting you
for what you are.

27:49.167 --> 27:50.418
Yeah.

27:50.460 --> 27:54.506
That part was, uh,
definitely rough.

27:56.883 --> 27:58.677
My story's the opposite.

27:58.718 --> 28:01.388
My mom's done everything
she can to support me,

28:01.429 --> 28:03.223
even letting me stay
here in Mystic Falls

28:03.264 --> 28:04.849
to let me make the
most of what I got.

28:04.891 --> 28:07.686
Which isn't much,
compared to you.

28:07.727 --> 28:12.607
But that's why getting
cut hurts so much,

28:12.649 --> 28:14.442
'cause I don't know
how to tell her.

28:14.484 --> 28:16.194
Or who I am without football.

28:20.115 --> 28:22.742
Wait, can you compel that
into me?

28:22.784 --> 28:25.620
Uh... Yeah.

28:25.662 --> 28:27.372
But, um,

28:27.414 --> 28:31.084
I'd rather help you figure
that out on the other side.

28:34.838 --> 28:37.090
Well, I'm curious
about your next move.

28:37.132 --> 28:38.675
What do you mean?

28:38.717 --> 28:40.093
Well, you can say that
you're not a superhero,

28:40.135 --> 28:42.137
but that's a load of crap.

28:42.178 --> 28:44.931
If there's one thing guys
like us know, with great power

28:44.973 --> 28:47.058
comes great
responsibility.

28:47.100 --> 28:50.103
So how are you gonna use
those powers for good?

28:53.606 --> 28:54.941
(watch beeping)

28:57.235 --> 28:59.320
(beeping stops)

29:08.705 --> 29:13.376
The, um, vervain
should be out of your system.

29:15.712 --> 29:18.089
Hey, can I ask a favor first?

29:19.549 --> 29:21.926
Don't take everything away.

29:21.968 --> 29:24.053
Uh, leave the part
where we met today.

29:25.930 --> 29:28.183
Why?

29:28.224 --> 29:31.978
Because we're friends now,
right?

29:32.020 --> 29:35.607
And I-I could really use one
right about now.

29:36.858 --> 29:38.735
KALEB:
What are you waiting for?

29:38.777 --> 29:41.446
Start complimenting each other
while I go distract this thing.

29:42.989 --> 29:44.699
(roars)

29:44.741 --> 29:46.284
I like the color of your hair.

29:46.326 --> 29:49.746
I also like the color
of your hair. And the cut.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.581
Although the one before it
did frame your face better.

29:52.999 --> 29:54.375
Seriously?

29:54.417 --> 29:56.461
Respect has to be genuine.

29:56.503 --> 29:58.338
You guys have to understand
that despite your differences,

29:58.379 --> 30:00.965
there's a lot you two
have in common.
LIZZIE: Disagree.

30:01.007 --> 30:03.593
I would have never made
the choice that Hope did.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.053
Josie could have died.

30:08.932 --> 30:09.974
(whoops)

30:10.016 --> 30:11.226
Here. Grab this.

30:11.267 --> 30:12.977
I'm sorry about that.

30:13.019 --> 30:14.354
I never meant to hurt
your sister or you.

30:14.395 --> 30:15.980
I just didn't know
what else to do.

30:17.357 --> 30:18.650
Well, I guess

30:18.691 --> 30:20.652
the way that you put
Landon first 24/7

30:20.693 --> 30:23.571
is kind of like what I do
with Josie, and myself.

30:25.698 --> 30:27.867
Maybe in the past,
but you've changed, Lizzie.

30:27.909 --> 30:29.536
And honestly, I wish I
could be as proactive

30:29.577 --> 30:31.788
as you when it comes
to bettering myself.

30:33.248 --> 30:34.833
LANDON:
Okay, come on, Cleo.

30:34.874 --> 30:36.918
You got this.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.878
And I wish I had
your confidence.

30:38.920 --> 30:40.421
I can only imagine
what it's like

30:40.463 --> 30:42.799
to not second-guess myself
all the time.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.968
To always be the hero.

30:47.262 --> 30:48.429
Y-You're doing it!

30:48.471 --> 30:49.681
It's shrinking!

30:49.722 --> 30:51.182
Well, I'd trade
my confidence

30:51.224 --> 30:52.642
for your brutal honesty.

30:52.684 --> 30:55.478
And your ability to
coordinate outfits.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.689
(chuckles)
Well, that can be arranged.

30:57.730 --> 31:00.233
If you teach me your badass,
icy glare.

31:00.275 --> 31:01.734
LANDON:
Come on.

31:01.776 --> 31:03.111
You got this.

31:05.738 --> 31:07.490
We got this.

31:09.367 --> 31:10.743
Not so big now, huh?

31:15.206 --> 31:16.916
I'm sorry about today.

31:16.958 --> 31:19.377
Might be new,
but you are totally Squad.

31:19.419 --> 31:21.838
Welcome to your
first mission.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.506
Let us blast this thing.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.261
Where did it go?

31:28.303 --> 31:30.388
It's right here.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.726
(high-pitched whimpering)

31:34.767 --> 31:37.103
It is only a matter of time

31:37.145 --> 31:40.315
until I return
to my magnificent form...

31:40.356 --> 31:42.400
Hmm. At least we know
it still talks.

31:42.442 --> 31:44.652
Yeah. You know, we better
get a "A" on this assignment.

31:44.694 --> 31:46.696
I want to take
the little thing

31:46.738 --> 31:48.698
and put it in a mason jar
and just give it to Doc S.

31:48.740 --> 31:51.618
So long as we respect one
another the entire time

31:51.659 --> 31:54.245
it remains in captivity,
for if we do not...

31:54.287 --> 31:55.955
I don't love those odds.

31:55.997 --> 31:57.874
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

31:57.916 --> 32:00.335
More often than I care to admit.

32:00.376 --> 32:02.128
(gremlin squealing)

32:07.675 --> 32:09.385
How was your first day back?

32:09.427 --> 32:11.137
LANDON:
Exhausting.

32:13.056 --> 32:16.351
Well, at least the thread count
is better here than in Malivore.

32:16.392 --> 32:18.269
(chuckles)

32:19.187 --> 32:22.690
Don't leave this bed, ever.

32:22.732 --> 32:24.901
I wish that were
the answer.

what you did for me.

32:42.794 --> 32:46.214
But I don't want my being back
to be a burden to you.

32:46.255 --> 32:47.632
Or to anyone else.

32:47.674 --> 32:49.342
You're not a burden.

32:49.384 --> 32:51.636
And even if you were,
I mean, I can handle it.

32:51.678 --> 32:53.137
You're everything to me.

32:53.179 --> 32:55.640
You've more
than proven that, but...

32:55.682 --> 32:58.518
maybe that's the problem.
No.

32:58.559 --> 33:00.895
The problem was that you were
stuck in a hell dimension.

33:00.937 --> 33:02.271
Now that I'm not,

33:02.313 --> 33:03.773
I don't want to come between you

33:03.815 --> 33:05.650
or any of our friends
ever again.

33:05.692 --> 33:09.070
Which means I can't
be everything to you.

33:09.112 --> 33:11.155
It clearly breeds resentment.

33:11.197 --> 33:13.157
I don't care.

33:13.199 --> 33:15.326
As long as I have you.

33:15.368 --> 33:18.121
That's the thing, Hope--
you always will.

33:18.162 --> 33:20.707
So maybe worry
about having me

I thought we'd be having.

33:57.285 --> 33:59.871
Not that I'm complaining.
(chuckles)

33:59.912 --> 34:01.748
Thanks for walking me here.

34:06.794 --> 34:09.047
Oh, wow.
I am amazed

34:09.088 --> 34:11.340
at how perfectly
they rebuilt this place.

34:11.382 --> 34:13.092
(scoffs)

34:14.594 --> 34:16.512
The shutters may have
changed a bit.

34:16.554 --> 34:20.558
But then again,
haven't we all?
(chuckles)

34:23.102 --> 34:25.855
Pull up a step.
Humor your old man.

34:29.233 --> 34:31.194
What did you think
we were gonna talk about?

34:31.235 --> 34:34.155
Oh, I don't know...

34:34.197 --> 34:38.451
me being willing
to do black magic with Hope,

34:38.493 --> 34:42.538
thus losing my chance to go to
Mystic Falls High and live here.

34:43.831 --> 34:45.416
Yeah, well...

34:45.458 --> 34:47.543
That would be
pretty hypocritical.

34:49.504 --> 34:51.714
I understand
why you did it.

34:51.756 --> 34:53.549
I don't condone it,

34:53.591 --> 34:56.469
but I know you were
just trying to make up

34:56.511 --> 34:58.179
for a past mistake.

34:58.221 --> 35:00.765
Kind of like I'm trying to do.

35:00.807 --> 35:02.683
With the portal?

35:02.725 --> 35:06.479
No. I'm talking about us, Jo.

35:06.521 --> 35:08.731
You know, there is

35:08.773 --> 35:11.609
nothing more important to me
than you and your sister.

35:13.319 --> 35:14.654
And maybe
you'd know that

35:14.695 --> 35:16.989
if I said it more,
instead of just...

35:17.031 --> 35:19.450
(inhales deeply) ...showing up
and buying milkshakes.

35:19.492 --> 35:21.661
I do know that, Dad.

35:21.702 --> 35:24.956
Never stop
buying me milkshakes, okay?

35:24.997 --> 35:26.833
Deal.

35:27.792 --> 35:29.961
(both chuckle softly)

35:32.880 --> 35:34.382
You know you
can talk to me.

35:34.423 --> 35:36.300
Right?

35:36.342 --> 35:38.177
About anything.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.640
I don't want to keep each other
in the dark,

35:42.682 --> 35:45.017
like Ethan and Mac,

35:45.059 --> 35:47.645
no matter how noble
our intentions are.

35:50.439 --> 35:52.066
Just...

35:53.359 --> 35:56.154
Just trying to let you go
a little, you know.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.534
Let you grow up.

36:06.164 --> 36:09.750
(takes deep breath)

36:09.792 --> 36:12.086
You know, it's hard.

36:12.128 --> 36:15.882
It's really hard.
(sniffles)

36:18.509 --> 36:20.386
You know, like, Malivore's...

36:20.428 --> 36:22.680
(chuckles):
...way easier.
(laughs)

36:22.722 --> 36:24.974
Oh, man.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.476
On that note...

36:27.518 --> 36:29.228
I, uh...

36:29.270 --> 36:31.230
I'm gonna head back
to the school.

36:31.272 --> 36:34.108
Or you could stay for dinner.

36:35.902 --> 36:37.653
Aunt Elena's gonna be home soon
from her shift,

36:37.695 --> 36:38.905
and she's planning
on making some

36:38.946 --> 36:41.240
old Salvatore family recipe.

36:41.282 --> 36:43.075
(laughs)
(chuckles)

36:43.117 --> 36:46.954
Plus, there's still stuff
for us to talk about.

36:48.164 --> 36:50.041
Yeah?

36:51.584 --> 36:53.377
Like wh-what?

36:53.419 --> 36:54.879
Um...

36:56.380 --> 36:57.882
I know I make it seem

36:57.924 --> 37:00.468
like everything's perfect
at Mystic Falls,

37:00.509 --> 37:02.720
but, um...

37:04.347 --> 37:06.432
There's this girl at school.

37:06.474 --> 37:08.226
It's...

37:08.267 --> 37:09.936
it's complicated.

37:11.646 --> 37:13.147
Yeah.

37:13.189 --> 37:16.234
Well, in that case,

37:16.275 --> 37:19.028
Malivore can wait.

37:20.863 --> 37:22.949
Besides,
the last person I want

37:22.990 --> 37:25.743

can mend fences,

38:07.285 --> 38:09.829
no reason why we can't.

I figured the monster
was taking Cleo to it,

39:17.188 --> 39:19.940
and that if I could find it, you
might be able to finally chill.

Any luck with the portal?

40:28.050 --> 40:29.593
LIZZIE:
No.

40:29.635 --> 40:31.887
I have no idea where the
monsters are coming from.

40:31.929 --> 40:35.182
Hopefully
they'll just stop.

40:36.475 --> 40:38.561
♪ ♪

40:44.733 --> 40:47.236
This is an unexpected visit.

40:47.278 --> 40:48.571
Your bourbon's better than mine.

40:48.612 --> 40:50.281
Well, you better
make it a double,

40:50.322 --> 40:51.657
'cause I'm way ahead of you.

40:51.699 --> 40:54.285
Actually, you're not.

40:54.326 --> 40:57.663
You found out
what the artifact is.
No.

40:57.705 --> 40:59.915
But I have seen it before.

41:05.337 --> 41:07.506
Is that...
Albert Einstein.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.634
Look at his bookshelf.

41:12.094 --> 41:14.430
I'll be damned.

41:14.472 --> 41:17.016
At least he's one of
the good guys, right?

41:17.057 --> 41:19.518
If you overlook
the atomic bomb.

41:21.103 --> 41:24.231
These two,
on the other hand...

41:24.273 --> 41:25.483
far more questionable.

41:26.442 --> 41:28.110
ALARIC:
Rasputin.

41:30.571 --> 41:33.699
And Napoleon Bonaparte.

41:38.662 --> 41:40.956
I'm gonna go with
"cause for concern."
