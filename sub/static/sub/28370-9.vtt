I can't believe he's
the one that did it.

00:06.267 --> 00:08.182

to rot in jail

00:08.225 --> 00:09.879

what he did.

shot Tyson Parker, but...

Tyson's case isn't closed.

Wesley didn't
do it alone.

00:32.554 --> 00:34.164
Two people killed him.

00:34.208 --> 00:35.905
Jess told me that
Wesley texted Tyson

the murder,

00:37.167 --> 00:38.908

him at Pearl Court.

one more time?

in Tyson's face.

then he left.

a while. It was brutal.

been Darnell?

friend. Okay?

07:35.324 --> 07:38.109

was in on it the whole time,

07:38.153 --> 07:39.676
and was just pretending
to help me.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.591
No. If Darnell killed
his own cousin,

07:41.635 --> 07:43.506
it would have to be
over something much bigger

07:43.550 --> 07:45.769
than some low-level dealer
in a pizza parlor. Okay?

07:45.813 --> 07:47.162

07:47.205 --> 07:50.557

Uh, I...

07:50.600 --> 07:51.993
I really don't know.

07:54.343 --> 07:56.780
I need to talk
to one of his friends.

07:58.869 --> 08:01.829
Can't believe I'm talking
to you guys about this.

08:01.872 --> 08:03.831
Well, Max works
for Darnell, too.

08:03.874 --> 08:05.659
We're not gonna
tell anyone.

08:05.702 --> 08:08.749
We won't. [chuckles]
I swear.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.446
Come on.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.274
All right.

08:12.317 --> 08:14.711
It's just, Tyson was my boy.

08:14.755 --> 08:16.278
And if it really is Darnell,

08:16.321 --> 08:18.062
I don't want him
getting away with it.

08:18.106 --> 08:22.023
It's not like I can do anything
about it in my position.

08:22.066 --> 08:23.633
Well, could it
have been Darnell?

08:23.677 --> 08:26.288
[sighs]

08:26.331 --> 08:28.464
Okay, look, a few months ago,

08:28.508 --> 08:31.902
our boss, like, Darnell's boss,
Nia, got arrested.

08:31.946 --> 08:33.556

08:33.600 --> 08:37.517
So he talked to all of us,
but Ty was being cagey.

08:37.560 --> 08:39.736
Do you think
Tyson flipped?

08:39.780 --> 08:42.957
I don't know.
Wesley thought he did.

08:46.264 --> 08:48.789
Look, I got to go.

08:48.832 --> 08:50.704
We cool?

08:50.747 --> 08:52.923
Yeah.

08:52.967 --> 08:54.359
Yeah, thanks.

08:54.403 --> 08:55.970
All right.

08:58.668 --> 09:00.452
Okay, who the
hell is Nia?

09:00.496 --> 09:03.543
Our boss.
Uh, never met her.

09:03.586 --> 09:05.588
So maybe Tyson
wasn't killed

09:05.632 --> 09:07.198
over the whole
Wesley-Crawford mess,

09:07.242 --> 09:09.157
and Darnell just wanted
us to think that.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.463
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
it's possible.

09:11.507 --> 09:13.422
Okay, so is this
all about Nia, then?

09:13.465 --> 09:15.424
[chuckles]
I-I don't know.

09:15.467 --> 09:18.166
If I can figure out
if Tyson flipped on her,

09:18.209 --> 09:20.995
then I'll know if Darnell
had a reason to kill him.

09:21.038 --> 09:24.041
Sure, but I don't know how
you're gonna figure that out.

their informants.

What? Because she's
having a boy?

09:43.670 --> 09:45.236

to spin it and be like,

10:04.516 --> 10:06.170
What?

10:06.214 --> 10:08.085
Are you being
serious right now?

10:08.129 --> 10:10.871
You literally jump every
time she calls or texts.

10:10.914 --> 10:11.959
I do not.

10:12.002 --> 10:14.222
Whatever. I mean, you--

10:14.265 --> 10:16.659
You obviously like her.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.226
[scoffs]

10:18.269 --> 10:21.142
You can tell me.
We're adults.

10:22.491 --> 10:26.060
Look, I don't know
what's going on,

10:26.103 --> 10:28.062
but I need to talk to Murphy.

10:28.105 --> 10:31.021
Wow.
I'm sorry.

10:31.065 --> 10:32.849
You're an idiot.

10:32.893 --> 10:34.111
Like, a giant idiot.

10:34.155 --> 10:35.983
Can I get another one
of these, please?

10:36.026 --> 10:37.637
Yeah.

10:38.855 --> 10:40.857
[vehicle door closes]

10:44.731 --> 10:46.646
Hi.

10:46.689 --> 10:48.038
Hey.

10:48.082 --> 10:49.649
Um...

10:49.692 --> 10:51.128
I was really glad
you texted. [sighs]

10:51.172 --> 10:54.262
I've, uh, kind of been wanting
to talk to you all day.

10:54.305 --> 10:56.046
Yeah?

10:56.090 --> 10:58.440
Yeah. Um...

10:58.483 --> 11:03.532
about last night,
it was... nice.

11:03.575 --> 11:05.186
Right?

11:08.580 --> 11:12.019
And that is not
why you are here.

11:12.062 --> 11:13.455
Uh, no, no.

11:13.498 --> 11:16.066
I am an idiot.

11:17.851 --> 11:21.158
Um, I mean,
I'm with Max, and--

11:21.202 --> 11:22.551
We're-we're friends.
You know?

11:22.594 --> 11:24.945
Yeah, yeah, can we just
move past that,

11:24.988 --> 11:27.861
pretend that didn't happen?Y-Yeah, I-I would
love that.

11:27.904 --> 11:29.645
Thank you.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.429
[sighs]

11:31.473 --> 11:35.869
So, then, what did you
want to talk about?

11:35.912 --> 11:41.004
Um, I wanted to ask if
Tyson was an informant

11:41.048 --> 11:43.006
for you guys.

11:43.050 --> 11:44.616
I don't know.

11:44.660 --> 11:46.793
Who would know?

11:46.836 --> 11:50.666
Um, probably just Narcotics,

11:50.710 --> 11:52.842
or lawyers on the case.

11:52.886 --> 11:54.496
Why are you asking me this?

11:54.539 --> 11:58.065
If Tyson was an informant,

11:58.108 --> 12:00.371
then I think Darnell
would've had a reason

12:00.415 --> 12:03.113
to kill him with Wesley.

12:11.643 --> 12:14.168
[siren wailing in distance]

12:15.212 --> 12:17.127
You actually drink that?

12:17.171 --> 12:20.565
[scoffs]
Only in emergencies.

12:20.609 --> 12:23.046
Question. Have you guys
ever humiliated yourself

12:23.090 --> 12:25.092
in such a deep way

12:25.135 --> 12:27.398
that it actually made you
physically nauseated?

12:27.442 --> 12:28.704
No.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.140
I don't think.

12:30.184 --> 12:32.882
Great. Thank you
for the support.
[chuckles]

12:32.926 --> 12:34.492
Hey, by the way,
any chance I could

12:34.536 --> 12:36.581
get the name of the informant
that flipped on Nia Bailey?

12:37.931 --> 12:38.888
If I don't protect
my informants,

12:38.932 --> 12:39.889
I won't have any left.

12:39.933 --> 12:42.152
Not helpful.
Yeah.

12:43.458 --> 12:44.633
[sighs]

12:44.676 --> 12:46.548
Why are you asking
about Nia Bailey?

12:46.591 --> 12:47.810
'Cause someone in her
organization rolled.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.856
I mean, that's why
she got arrested.

12:49.899 --> 12:51.161
Maybe it was Tyson.

12:51.205 --> 12:53.555
She's in jail.
She couldn't have killed him.

12:53.598 --> 12:55.383
No, but she could've gotten
a couple of her guys to do it.

12:55.426 --> 12:56.776
Wesley Moreno,
Darnell James.

12:56.819 --> 12:58.778
[scoffs]
Darnell's his cousin.

12:58.821 --> 13:00.562
Yeah, well, he threatened him.

13:00.605 --> 13:03.695
Darnell threatened Tyson?

13:03.739 --> 13:05.132
Two days before
the murder.

13:05.175 --> 13:07.351
Got it on tape. Look.

13:07.395 --> 13:09.571
Got Wesley and Darnell
confronting Tyson.

13:11.878 --> 13:14.837
Wow. Well, let's bring him in.

13:14.881 --> 13:16.186
I'm on it.

13:19.363 --> 13:22.584
Mr. James, thank you
for coming in.

13:22.627 --> 13:24.716
DARNELL:
Oh, for you two?

13:24.760 --> 13:25.892
Anything.

13:28.416 --> 13:31.245
Where were you
the night of Tyson's murder?

13:31.288 --> 13:33.725
[chuckles softly]
Seriously?

13:33.769 --> 13:35.118
JULES:
Darnell,

13:35.162 --> 13:38.339
just give us your alibi,
and we can clear this all up.

13:40.558 --> 13:44.127
I was watching the Bulls game
with my boy Vincent.

13:44.171 --> 13:46.347
Yeah?
Home or away game?

13:46.390 --> 13:47.783
Away.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.524
Who won?
The Pistons.

13:49.567 --> 13:52.092
And I'm done talking
without a lawyer.

13:56.966 --> 13:59.012
He's lying.

14:08.935 --> 14:11.676
You haven't said a word
since you got here, so...

14:12.808 --> 14:14.810
What are we doing?

14:14.854 --> 14:16.856
There it is.

14:16.899 --> 14:18.683
[sighs]

14:18.727 --> 14:20.990
What's the endgame here?

14:21.034 --> 14:23.384
I know you didn't
kill him,

14:23.427 --> 14:25.255
but you know I can't do my job.

14:25.299 --> 14:28.824
I can't actually
investigate you.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.043
This is ridiculous.

14:30.086 --> 14:32.045
[sighs]

14:32.088 --> 14:33.698
They--

14:34.917 --> 14:37.746
We...

14:37.789 --> 14:39.269
have video of you

14:39.313 --> 14:41.924
threatening Tyson,
and it's not a good look.

14:41.968 --> 14:43.752
Half this job is theatrics.

14:43.795 --> 14:45.841
I got to front a little,
you know that.

14:45.885 --> 14:49.932
Well, I keep pretending like
there's some happy ending here,

14:49.976 --> 14:51.978
and there's not.

14:52.021 --> 14:54.719
I can't do this anymore.

14:54.763 --> 14:56.765
No, no, come on, Jules.

14:56.808 --> 14:59.811
I love you.

14:59.855 --> 15:02.379
Yeah.

15:04.468 --> 15:06.470
But it's not enough.

15:07.994 --> 15:10.953
We've tried this "us."

15:10.997 --> 15:13.608
It doesn't work.

15:17.003 --> 15:19.005
I'm sorry.

15:20.658 --> 15:22.747
Yeah.

15:22.791 --> 15:24.488
[door opens, closes]

15:32.192 --> 15:34.194
What is that yummy smell?

15:35.630 --> 15:39.155
Oh, God, are you
making something for Vanessa?

15:39.199 --> 15:42.593
I am making her
seven cupcakes,

15:42.637 --> 15:44.378
one for each month.

15:44.421 --> 15:46.684
Okay, this is getting
a little ridiculous.

15:46.728 --> 15:48.556
[chuckles]
Dude!

15:48.599 --> 15:50.558
[scoffs] Now I have
to frost another one.

15:50.601 --> 15:52.255
You know what,
calm down.

15:52.299 --> 15:54.040
She doesn't even eat anything
except blueberries.

15:55.650 --> 15:57.304
This is so good.

15:57.347 --> 15:59.175
Thanks.

15:59.219 --> 16:01.612
Okay, I'll be right back.Where you going?

16:01.656 --> 16:04.964
Um, remember that boss lady Nia
I told you about?

16:05.007 --> 16:06.356
Yeah.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.402
I found out who her lawyer is,

16:08.445 --> 16:09.881
so I'm gonna go down
to his office

16:09.925 --> 16:11.492
and get the witness list
from her trial

16:11.535 --> 16:14.451
and see if I can figure out
if Tyson was the informant.

16:17.193 --> 16:18.673
What?

16:18.716 --> 16:20.980
This is objectively stupid.

16:21.023 --> 16:23.678
Okay, so is making
this big of a deal

16:23.721 --> 16:25.027
out of a seven-month
anniversary,

16:25.071 --> 16:26.855
because you are a cheater.

16:26.898 --> 16:28.117
[chuckles]:
Shut up!

16:28.161 --> 16:30.467
Know what, you're mean.
You won't help me.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.604
Do you really think Darnell
could have killed Tyson?

16:38.258 --> 16:40.260
I'm starting to.

16:43.654 --> 16:45.265
[door buzzes, opens]

16:52.533 --> 16:55.318
Surprise visit.
Can't be good.

16:55.362 --> 16:57.277
Nah, everything's fine.

16:57.320 --> 17:00.845
I just came to see about a
little bit more responsibility.

17:02.195 --> 17:04.023
Where's this coming from?

17:05.981 --> 17:09.158
Let's just say I've given up
a lot for this job,

17:09.202 --> 17:12.379
and if I'm gonna be in it,
I need to be in it.

17:12.422 --> 17:14.207
No more middleman-ing.

17:17.297 --> 17:19.212
All right.

17:22.563 --> 17:25.218
[door opens]

17:25.261 --> 17:27.916
[sighs, chuckles]

17:27.959 --> 17:29.439
Why so jumpy?

17:29.483 --> 17:31.311
I'm not.

17:31.354 --> 17:33.617
I need to make a withdrawal.

17:33.661 --> 17:37.099
Well, the bank is open.
How much?

17:37.143 --> 17:38.318
Hundred stacks.

17:38.361 --> 17:41.277
[sighs] Damn.

17:41.321 --> 17:44.106
That's a-- What, are you
skipping town or something?

17:44.150 --> 17:46.761
Nah.

17:46.804 --> 17:48.284
[smacks lips]

17:48.328 --> 17:51.418
Come on, man, what--
What's going on?

17:53.550 --> 17:55.770
Nia's having me handle
a drop tonight.

17:55.813 --> 17:57.772
A big one.

17:57.815 --> 18:00.253
Ah. Got it, got it.

18:00.296 --> 18:02.472
[chuckles]
Congrats, man. Congrats.

18:02.516 --> 18:03.908
Hey, man, you good?

18:03.952 --> 18:06.737
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Always.

18:06.781 --> 18:10.132
A'ight, then.
Let's get it done.

18:10.176 --> 18:12.352
I can't mess this one up.

18:12.395 --> 18:15.790
Well, I don't keep
that kind of cash on hand.

18:15.833 --> 18:18.314
But I'll get it,
all right?

18:20.316 --> 18:22.318
A'ight, bet.

18:30.196 --> 18:33.024
MURPHY: They e-mailed it to me.
Still objectively stupid?

18:33.068 --> 18:34.243
JESS:
Murphy, shut up, okay?

18:34.287 --> 18:36.071
So you got the list,
but, you know,

18:36.115 --> 18:38.160
they're not gonna have
the C.I.'s name on there.

18:38.204 --> 18:39.422
[sighs]

18:39.466 --> 18:41.294
I've never been here
on the weekend.

18:41.337 --> 18:43.122
It's eerie.

18:43.165 --> 18:45.689
Well, you're the one that left
our computer charger here.

18:45.733 --> 18:48.344
I suggest we invest
in another one.

18:48.388 --> 18:49.345
FELIX: Hello.[both gasp]

18:49.389 --> 18:50.955
[exhales]

18:50.999 --> 18:52.696
What are you doing here?

18:52.740 --> 18:54.568
You know what they say.
If you don't bother

18:54.611 --> 18:57.092
coming to work on Saturdays,
don't come on Sundays.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.834
What? What-what does that
even mean?

18:59.877 --> 19:01.227
I have to mow the lawn.

19:01.270 --> 19:03.098
Cool.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.187
Okay.

19:06.710 --> 19:08.190
Uh...

19:08.234 --> 19:10.192
Do you see anything?Yeah, yeah, a witness list.

19:10.236 --> 19:12.063
Um...

19:12.107 --> 19:14.762
it says, "Undisclosed C.I."

19:14.805 --> 19:17.939
I told you, they don't just list
names of criminal informants.

19:17.982 --> 19:19.984
And what are
you guys doing?

19:20.028 --> 19:22.073
When have I ever told you
what we're doing?

19:22.117 --> 19:23.466
Well, you have to
tell me actually,

19:23.510 --> 19:25.251
because you're on company Wi-Fi
and, oh, yeah,

19:25.294 --> 19:27.078
I'm the boss of the company.

19:27.122 --> 19:28.428
JESS:
She's trying to figure out

19:28.471 --> 19:31.300
if Tyson was an informant
for a big case.

19:31.344 --> 19:33.433
Ah.

19:33.476 --> 19:35.435
Well, does it say
the informant was a minor?

19:35.478 --> 19:36.784
Because they have to
disclose that.

19:36.827 --> 19:39.874
Is that true?
How do you know that?

19:41.484 --> 19:43.312
I went to Harvard Law.

19:45.053 --> 19:46.794
[both laughing]

19:46.837 --> 19:47.838
Yeah, right.

19:47.882 --> 19:50.450
You knew this.
Why is that funny?

19:50.493 --> 19:51.799
Wait. Wait, wait.

19:51.842 --> 19:54.062
You-you passed up being
a lawyer to work here?

19:54.105 --> 19:55.803
Do you hate getting laid?

19:55.846 --> 19:57.848
My whole family went, so I went.

19:57.892 --> 19:59.633
But I prefer
the nonprofit sphere.

19:59.676 --> 20:01.243
Now I'm gonna go mow the lawn.

20:01.287 --> 20:02.984
No, no, no, no, no.

20:03.027 --> 20:04.028
Come back.
Wh-What were you saying?

20:04.072 --> 20:05.987
Oh, now you want to know?Yes.

20:06.030 --> 20:07.597
I was saying that
the prosecution

20:07.641 --> 20:10.078
would have to disclose
if the informant was a minor.

20:10.121 --> 20:13.560
So Tyson couldn't
have been the informant.

20:13.603 --> 20:17.303
Well, if it wasn't Tyson,
who the hell could it be?

20:17.346 --> 20:19.218
[thunder rumbling softly]

20:23.047 --> 20:25.049
[sighs]

20:35.059 --> 20:37.105
[scoffs softly]

20:37.148 --> 20:40.239
You want to tell me what Nia
and Darnell met about yesterday?

20:47.855 --> 20:49.204
Did Darnell call
you for cash?

20:49.248 --> 20:51.511
Yes. Okay?
Oh, my God.

20:51.554 --> 20:53.295
The fact that I had
to seek you out--

20:53.339 --> 20:55.079
You need to tell me
when he's buying, Max.

20:55.123 --> 20:57.778
Okay. He's buying.

20:57.821 --> 20:59.823
When's the deal?

20:59.867 --> 21:01.869
Tonight.

21:01.912 --> 21:03.610
Tonight?

21:03.653 --> 21:07.962
Max, how are you not
getting how this works?

21:08.005 --> 21:10.878
You've been stalling for months
and now you're sitting on this?

21:10.921 --> 21:13.184
Oh, I'm sorry, maybe 'cause I'm
rolling on literal murderers?

21:13.228 --> 21:14.751
You should've thought about that
before you started

21:14.795 --> 21:17.537
cleaning money for them.[scoffs]

21:17.580 --> 21:19.582
How much is the deal?

21:22.629 --> 21:25.588
A hundred grand.

21:25.632 --> 21:27.590
That's the bust we
need to convict Nia.

21:27.634 --> 21:29.679
One of her guys making a sale
that big seals our case.

21:29.723 --> 21:31.551
Look, I don't care.
What's gonna happen to Darnell?

21:31.594 --> 21:33.292
What the hell do you think
is gonna happen to Darnell?

21:33.335 --> 21:35.772
He's buying $100,000 worth
of heroin.

21:35.816 --> 21:38.297
Right.

21:38.340 --> 21:40.864
Yeah.

21:40.908 --> 21:45.129
Just tell me where the deal is,
and we're good to go.

21:45.173 --> 21:48.350
I don't know.

21:48.394 --> 21:50.352
What?
I don't know.

21:50.396 --> 21:52.093
Okay? Darnell doesn't
tell me those things.

21:52.136 --> 21:53.660
I just bring him his money.

21:53.703 --> 21:56.184
Well, do not bring him his money

21:56.227 --> 21:58.534
until you know
where the deal is.

21:58.578 --> 22:00.580
Or it's your ass.

22:14.158 --> 22:16.726
Where the hell is my money, man?

22:18.772 --> 22:21.340
I only have half
the money right now.

22:21.383 --> 22:23.342
That's all I keep
in any one bank.

22:23.385 --> 22:25.039
Well, you know
I'm not going there

22:25.082 --> 22:26.519
to buy half their stash, right?

22:26.562 --> 22:29.043
Yeah, I know.

22:29.086 --> 22:30.392
I have more in a bank
in Naperville.

22:30.436 --> 22:31.654
I'll go there.

22:31.698 --> 22:34.091
Naperville?
How long is that gonna take?

22:34.135 --> 22:36.137
I don't know, uh,
a couple hours, you know.

22:36.180 --> 22:37.921
I promised Nia
this would go smooth.

22:37.965 --> 22:40.707
Dude, chill.

22:40.750 --> 22:42.883
I'll just meet you there.

22:42.926 --> 22:45.451
Okay? I got you.

22:45.494 --> 22:47.714
Hey.

22:47.757 --> 22:49.716
I'm good.

22:53.937 --> 22:55.461
All right.

22:58.942 --> 23:01.162
Uh, who's the man?

23:01.205 --> 23:02.772
[humming]

23:02.816 --> 23:04.774
Don't dance.
Don't-don't do that. Mm-mm.

23:04.818 --> 23:07.124
I talked to Sarah. Turns
out that she had a bead

23:07.168 --> 23:09.170
on that guy Vincent the
night of Tyson's murder.

23:09.213 --> 23:11.868
Said he was out doing
a deal all night.
Vincent?

23:11.912 --> 23:12.956
Yeah, the guy that Darnell said

23:13.000 --> 23:14.131
he was watching
the Bulls game with.

23:14.175 --> 23:16.830
So Darnell's alibi
doesn't check out.

23:16.873 --> 23:17.831
[fingers snap]

23:17.874 --> 23:19.136
Problem is...

23:19.180 --> 23:20.834
There's not enough to convict.

23:22.705 --> 23:24.664
[sighs]

23:24.707 --> 23:26.709
So, you work for Nia.

23:26.753 --> 23:28.145
Mm-hmm.

23:28.189 --> 23:32.019
If it wasn't Tyson, who else
would've ratted her out?

23:32.062 --> 23:33.716
Does it matter
if it wasn't Tyson?

23:33.760 --> 23:38.765
Well, yes, because whoever it is
is responsible for his death.

23:38.808 --> 23:41.550
No, I don't think that's true.

23:41.594 --> 23:43.596
It is true.

23:51.778 --> 23:53.736
Why are you being weird?

23:53.780 --> 23:55.390
I'm not.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.392
Yes, you are.
You're, like, barely talking.

23:57.436 --> 24:01.396
Usually, you're like,
"Murphy, tell me your feelings."

24:01.440 --> 24:03.616
"Murphy, let's talk about that."

24:03.659 --> 24:05.705
"Murphy, I wish
you could see the stars."

24:05.748 --> 24:08.098
I'm just... just thinking.

24:08.142 --> 24:09.578
About what?

24:09.622 --> 24:12.581
About this whole Darnell thing.

24:12.625 --> 24:14.148
I'm just...

24:14.191 --> 24:16.933
Yeah, well...

24:16.977 --> 24:19.675
me, too.

24:19.719 --> 24:22.417
I'm just... [sighs]

24:22.461 --> 24:24.680
I'm just gonna go talk to him.

24:24.724 --> 24:27.117
What?

24:27.161 --> 24:31.644
What, and you think he's just
gonna tell you he did it?

24:31.687 --> 24:33.515
I'll know if he's lying.

24:33.559 --> 24:35.169
How?

24:36.387 --> 24:38.389
I just will.

24:44.613 --> 24:48.051
All right, Murphy. I got,
like, five minutes. What's up?

24:50.401 --> 24:53.361
Darnell, I know you loved Tyson
as much as I did.

24:55.406 --> 24:58.584
And if I was caught screaming at
him two days before his murder,

24:58.627 --> 25:02.196
I'd want a chance
to explain myself.

25:02.239 --> 25:05.068
What are you talking about?

25:05.112 --> 25:08.245
I know someone turned in
your boss.

25:08.289 --> 25:10.204
Are you seriously
asking me this right now?

25:10.247 --> 25:11.814
Just looking at the facts.

25:11.858 --> 25:14.643
There are two facts:

25:14.687 --> 25:19.039
Tyson wasn't a snitch,
and I would never have hurt him.

25:19.082 --> 25:21.694
Ever.

25:21.737 --> 25:23.739
Even if he was.

25:35.838 --> 25:38.624
I did, baby...[Vanessa laughs]

25:38.667 --> 25:40.974
Cocktail delivery.
Ah!

25:41.017 --> 25:43.629
Moscow mule for Vanessa,

25:43.672 --> 25:45.282
a very underwhelming Malbec
for Jess,

25:45.326 --> 25:47.197
and a vodka tonic

25:47.241 --> 25:49.504
for my new friend
Stacey.

25:49.548 --> 25:50.723
VANESSA:
[laughs] Well,

25:50.766 --> 25:52.812
good call inviting Felix.

25:52.855 --> 25:54.640
JESS: Thanks, guys.Cheers.

25:54.683 --> 25:55.641
Thanks, Felix.

25:55.684 --> 25:56.946
Come here, baby.
Cheers.

25:59.688 --> 26:01.777
[rock music playing
over speakers]

26:01.821 --> 26:03.823
MURPHY:
Chels?

26:06.826 --> 26:09.393
I'm not talking to you.

26:09.437 --> 26:12.788
What? Why?

26:12.832 --> 26:15.617
What is going on
with you and Dean?

26:15.661 --> 26:18.141
Oh, God, Chelsea.

26:18.185 --> 26:20.404
We... we both fell asleep
on the couch,

26:20.448 --> 26:23.103
and I just, I left
first thing in the morning.

26:23.146 --> 26:25.496
You spent the night together?

26:26.585 --> 26:27.890
No.

26:27.934 --> 26:29.675
[sighs]

26:29.718 --> 26:32.765
We just, uh, hung out.

26:34.636 --> 26:36.682
Okay, uh...
[chuckles]

26:36.725 --> 26:40.555
I would like to make a toast--
come here, baby-- to my...

26:40.599 --> 26:44.603
amazing girlfriend Vanessa.

26:44.646 --> 26:48.607
I love you so much,
and I can't i-imagine

26:48.650 --> 26:51.218
the last seven months
without you, so cheers.

26:51.261 --> 26:53.437
[gasps]
Wait. Let's Boomerang it.

26:53.481 --> 26:54.743
[chuckles]
Okay.

26:54.787 --> 26:56.136
[chuckles]

26:56.179 --> 26:57.703
[camera clicks]

26:57.746 --> 27:00.836
There it is.

27:00.880 --> 27:03.491
Wait, wait, wait.

28:04.030 --> 28:05.596
Yeah. Me, too, Murphy.

28:05.640 --> 28:06.902
Why don't you both go?

28:06.946 --> 28:09.600
Oh. Hey, Vanessa.

28:09.644 --> 28:13.169
Just go, and, um, take your
slutty friend with you.

28:14.605 --> 28:16.259
What?

28:16.303 --> 28:18.305
I don't have a slutty friend.
[scoffs]

28:19.698 --> 28:21.700
Was she talking to me?

28:29.403 --> 28:32.275
Some night, huh?

28:32.319 --> 28:35.148
Felix, why are you even here?
You didn't get kicked out.

28:35.191 --> 28:37.846
I sort of hit on
one of Vanessa's hot friends.

28:37.890 --> 28:40.327
Didn't go too well.Do you think Vanessa hates me?

28:40.370 --> 28:42.068
Where the hell is Max?

28:42.111 --> 28:44.853
Okay, cool.

28:44.897 --> 28:46.463
Sorry, he was just
acting weird earlier,

28:46.507 --> 28:49.510
and he hasn't texted me back
in hours. It's not like him.

28:49.553 --> 28:50.859
No, it's okay. Don't mind me.

28:50.903 --> 28:53.557
It's just my relationship
just imploded.

28:53.601 --> 28:55.690
I'm actually
worried, Jess.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.300
Okay? It's not like him.
I think we should

28:57.344 --> 28:58.824
go check on him, please.

28:58.867 --> 29:01.087
Okay, fine.
You want me to call an Uber?

29:03.698 --> 29:05.178
I could drive.

29:05.221 --> 29:06.919
You didn't drink?

29:06.962 --> 29:08.224
No.

29:08.268 --> 29:10.009
Felix, you bought, like,
four rounds of drinks,

29:10.052 --> 29:12.359
and you didn't buy one
for yourself?I'm a giver.

29:12.402 --> 29:16.363
Apparently that wasn't enough
for Vanessa's friend.

29:16.406 --> 29:18.147
Where's your dumb car?

29:18.191 --> 29:20.149
To your right.

29:20.193 --> 29:22.238
Come on.

29:25.198 --> 29:26.852
[laughs]

29:26.895 --> 29:29.680
Max and I have
the exact same whiskey rocks.

29:29.724 --> 29:31.682
Oh, neat-o.

29:31.726 --> 29:33.902
Where is he?

29:33.946 --> 29:36.209
How the hell is he not at home?

29:36.252 --> 29:38.037
[computer chimes]

29:38.080 --> 29:39.821
What was that?

29:39.865 --> 29:43.172
Uh, he just got a text.

29:43.216 --> 29:45.174
I guess they go through
to his computer.

29:45.218 --> 29:46.654
Well, what does it say?

29:46.697 --> 29:49.178
Murphy, no.
I do not feel comfortable...

29:49.222 --> 29:50.919
Felix, what does it say?

29:50.963 --> 29:52.399
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

29:52.442 --> 29:55.141
A man's computer
is a sacred place, believe me.

29:55.184 --> 29:56.664

29:56.707 --> 29:59.841
Jess, please!
Read it, please.

29:59.885 --> 30:02.626

30:02.670 --> 30:04.541
JESS:
It's from a number
he doesn't have saved,

30:04.585 --> 30:06.326
and it's three question marks.

30:06.369 --> 30:08.458
Did he respond?

30:08.502 --> 30:09.720
[computer chimes]

30:09.764 --> 30:12.158
Uh, yes. Just now.

30:12.201 --> 30:13.942
And?

30:13.986 --> 30:16.336
He says,

30:16.379 --> 30:19.556
"Lockhurst 342."

30:19.600 --> 30:21.863
It just went away.

30:21.907 --> 30:23.691
He must've deleted it.

30:23.734 --> 30:26.085
Oh, well, that's super shady.

30:26.128 --> 30:27.869
What-what the hell
does Lockhurst mean?

30:27.913 --> 30:29.175
It's a hotel.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.788
I mean, not one
I would ever stay at,

30:33.832 --> 30:36.138
but, you know, I drive past it
on the way to work, and...

30:36.182 --> 30:38.793
So, 34-- Uh...

30:38.837 --> 30:40.229
342 is-is, um...

30:40.273 --> 30:42.797
Room number. Yeah.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.320
It's a tough break, Murph.

30:44.364 --> 30:46.279
Happens to the best
of us, though. You know?

30:46.322 --> 30:49.543
Okay, Murphy,
don't listen to him.

30:49.586 --> 30:51.762
There's no way
Max is cheating on you.

30:51.806 --> 30:54.896
Yeah, maybe not.
Okay?

30:54.940 --> 30:56.376
He's obsessed with you.

30:56.419 --> 30:58.030
Kind of like how you're
obsessed with Vanessa?

30:58.073 --> 31:00.684
Oh, okay, you know...

31:00.728 --> 31:02.164
Felix, do you have your keys?

31:02.208 --> 31:04.036
Locked and loaded.

31:08.823 --> 31:10.781
Where's Darnell?

31:10.825 --> 31:12.566
He's getting here at 10:00.

31:12.609 --> 31:13.915
And when he
gets here, we...

31:13.959 --> 31:15.221
I'll meet him in the lobby,

31:15.264 --> 31:17.179
and then we'll go to 342
and make the deal.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.925
Hmm. They have guns.

31:23.969 --> 31:25.709
They all have guns.
That's great.

31:25.753 --> 31:27.755
Yes, Max, they're
heroin dealers.

31:27.798 --> 31:30.192
And what if something
goes wrong, hmm?

31:30.236 --> 31:31.759
Do you have guns?

31:31.802 --> 31:33.195
D-Do you guys have guns?

31:33.239 --> 31:36.938
Nothing is going to go wrong.

31:36.982 --> 31:39.375
I don't think I can do this.

31:39.419 --> 31:40.811
Okay, fine.

31:40.855 --> 31:43.553
Then we arrest you right now
for money laundering.

31:48.515 --> 31:50.952
Hey, Murph, the elevator's
right in front of us.

31:50.996 --> 31:54.608
Okay. I can take it
from here.

31:54.651 --> 31:56.218
What?
Hmm?

31:56.262 --> 31:58.133
No, I'm not gonna let you wander
around this hotel by yourself.

31:58.177 --> 32:00.135
I'm fine.
I have Pretzel.

32:00.179 --> 32:02.921
And I'm not gonna confront him
with you and stupid Felix.

32:04.661 --> 32:05.619
[elevator chimes]

32:05.662 --> 32:07.099
Don't follow me.
