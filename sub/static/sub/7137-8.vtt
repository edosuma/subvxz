01:46.967 --> 01:50.133
- Here are some scary facts
about impotence.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.967
10 to 20 million Americans
suffer from it,

01:53.033 --> 01:57.600
85% due to physical causes
not related to the penis.

01:57.667 --> 02:00.934
10% suffer because of
psychological reasons.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.800
And scariest of all,

02:02.867 --> 02:04.467
for 5% of the men
who are impotent,

02:04.533 --> 02:06.734
the cause is unknown.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.500
- Hey.

02:27.500 --> 02:29.533
Jesus.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.867
Don't do this to me, Vern.

02:31.934 --> 02:33.867
You guys
are all I got in here.

02:36.233 --> 02:38.934
- It's not my choice,
James.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.300
We got a charter
we gotta follow.

02:40.367 --> 02:42.533
You know that charter
better than anybody.

02:44.500 --> 02:45.667
- I asked
the fuckin' dentist.

02:45.734 --> 02:46.867
He said he put

02:46.934 --> 02:48.867
white man's gums
in my mouth--white!

02:48.934 --> 02:50.700
- Really?
'Cause that bruise

02:50.767 --> 02:53.166
Dr. Faraj planted
on your cheek is blue.

02:53.233 --> 02:55.300
That tells me
you didn't get the answer

02:55.367 --> 02:57.633
you were looking for.

02:57.700 --> 03:00.533
Tomorrow you're moving
to another cell.

03:07.100 --> 03:10.166
- There's Robson.
You were right, Imam.

03:10.233 --> 03:13.333
Allah has punished him
for his sins.

03:16.033 --> 03:17.667
How's the mouth?

03:17.734 --> 03:20.166
- Arif?
Fuck you.

03:25.467 --> 03:27.100
- Robson.

03:27.166 --> 03:30.900
Despite all you done,
my heart goes out to you.

03:30.967 --> 03:33.633
God is trying
to teach you something.

03:35.133 --> 03:37.166
Please be smart enough
to learn.

03:40.934 --> 03:42.734
- Yeah.

03:42.800 --> 03:44.967
He's saying my friends
will take me back.

03:45.033 --> 03:48.166
I'll make them
take me back.

03:55.567 --> 03:57.867
- Oh, looky here,
my stepbrother.

03:57.934 --> 04:00.300
Feels good talking with
a black man's gums, don't it?

04:00.367 --> 04:02.200
- I need a shitload
of tits, now.

04:02.266 --> 04:05.400
- You? All that Aryan drug-free
bullshit just bullshit ain't it?

04:05.467 --> 04:08.567
- Will you shut your fucking
corn-trap and hook me?

04:08.633 --> 04:10.533
Or I can take
my cash elsewhere.

04:10.600 --> 04:12.934
- All right, man.

04:53.600 --> 04:54.900
- Guard!

04:54.967 --> 04:55.934
Officer!

05:02.000 --> 05:04.367
- One of the physical causes
of impotence

05:04.433 --> 05:07.767
is lack of frequent
spontaneous erections.

05:07.834 --> 05:10.300
In other words,

05:10.367 --> 05:11.567
you can't get it up...

05:13.500 --> 05:15.400
Because you don't
get it up,

05:15.467 --> 05:17.233
because you can't
get it up,

05:17.300 --> 05:20.066
because you don't get it up.

05:21.734 --> 05:23.834
Either way, you're fucked.

05:25.333 --> 05:27.667
I can't get it up.

05:27.734 --> 05:30.033
- Miguel Alvarez is up
for parole again.

05:30.100 --> 05:32.233
- So what?
He'll just get rejected,

05:32.300 --> 05:35.166
same as last time.
- Maybe not.

05:35.233 --> 05:36.667
Tim, come on.

05:36.734 --> 05:38.934
With all the shit
he's pulled,

05:39.000 --> 05:40.166
the Board's not
gonna let him go free.

05:40.233 --> 05:42.100
- Well,
Alvarez is a changed man.

05:42.166 --> 05:44.133
He's really trying to
stay out of trouble.

05:44.200 --> 05:46.400
- Bullshit.
Look, I know he did a good job

05:46.467 --> 05:47.900
training the seeing-eye dog,

05:47.967 --> 05:50.767
but one pooch hardly balances
out his criminal record.

05:50.834 --> 05:52.667
- Well...

05:52.734 --> 05:55.266
I'm writing a letter to the
Board recommending parole.

05:55.333 --> 05:58.533
Alicia Hinden,
who ran the training program,

05:58.600 --> 05:59.967
is gonna do the same thing.

06:00.033 --> 06:02.100
And if Ray Mukada were here,
he would, too.

06:02.166 --> 06:05.233
- Tim, do you honestly
believe Miguel Alvarez

06:05.300 --> 06:07.400
is ready to rejoin society?

06:07.467 --> 06:08.967
Six months ago the dink
was in Solitary

06:09.033 --> 06:10.867
smearing shit
on his cell wall.

06:10.934 --> 06:13.333
- Well, I know there's been bad
blood between you and Alvarez

06:13.400 --> 06:15.233
almost since the day
he arrived.

06:15.300 --> 06:17.100
- What are you saying,
my judgment is clouded, man?

06:17.166 --> 06:18.567
Fuck you!
- Have you even spoken to him

06:18.633 --> 06:19.900
since you let him out of
solitary?

06:19.967 --> 06:20.934
- No.
- Don't you think

06:21.000 --> 06:23.166
you owe him that?
- Owe him?

06:23.233 --> 06:25.100
- Not warden to prisoner.
Man to man.

06:25.166 --> 06:27.266
I mean, if a person's
trying to change,

06:27.333 --> 06:28.700
shouldn't we at least
acknowledge that?

06:28.767 --> 06:30.066
- Not in Alvarez's case.

06:30.133 --> 06:32.133
- Leo--
- No, damn it, no, hell, no!

06:32.200 --> 06:33.667
Look, you file
your fuckin' letters

06:33.734 --> 06:35.333
of recommendation, okay?

06:35.400 --> 06:36.767
I'm gonna call
Steve Dawkins myself

06:36.834 --> 06:39.367
and put an end
to this bullshit.

06:41.166 --> 06:43.133
- Thanks for setting up
the parole hearing, McManus.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.200
- Well, to tell you
the truth, Miguel,

06:45.266 --> 06:47.300
these parole board hearings...

06:47.367 --> 06:51.033
your chances for release
are a long shot.

06:51.100 --> 06:53.333
- No, no, no, no.
I got a good feeling.

06:53.400 --> 06:55.767
I got a good feeling.
I got my A-game on.

06:55.834 --> 06:58.600
God, it'd be great just to
get away from Oz, you know?

06:58.667 --> 07:00.166
I could see Maritza.

07:00.233 --> 07:02.000
She's been let out
of Parker Women's.

07:02.066 --> 07:03.600
She got a job.

07:03.667 --> 07:05.767
You know, she's got
her life on course.

07:05.834 --> 07:09.066
Shit, maybe I can have
another baby, you know?

07:09.133 --> 07:11.333
I just gotta let the parole
board people understand

07:11.400 --> 07:14.567
that I can do that,
too, you know?

07:14.633 --> 07:17.633
That I know in my heart
that I'm ready.

07:32.166 --> 07:35.266
It's a pleasure
to meet you guys, you know.

07:35.333 --> 07:40.800
Um...yeah, my--my, uh,
dad and my, uh, grandfather

07:40.867 --> 07:43.467
were both incarcerated in here.

07:43.533 --> 07:45.266
Excuse me?

07:45.333 --> 07:46.567
- Alvarez,
what are you doing?

07:46.633 --> 07:48.533
- I'm just practicing my answers

07:48.600 --> 07:51.066
for the parole board hearing,
man.

07:54.066 --> 07:55.500
- Count!

07:57.633 --> 07:59.266
- Hey.
- Hey...

08:05.000 --> 08:06.800
- Hey, Charlie Brown.

08:15.633 --> 08:17.333
- Maritza.

08:19.233 --> 08:21.300
Maritza.

08:21.367 --> 08:22.967
Maritza, mi amor,

08:23.033 --> 08:25.333
pronto estare en sus brazos.

08:25.400 --> 08:26.700
- Fuck you.

08:26.767 --> 08:28.600
- Ooh, careful, Miguel.

08:28.667 --> 08:30.467
You wouldn't want a smudge
on that record

08:30.533 --> 08:32.934
this late in your parole.
- Shut the fuck up!

08:37.200 --> 08:40.667
- You know what would be
a terrible tragedy?

08:40.734 --> 08:42.200
Just before you got out,

08:42.266 --> 08:45.867
Maritza...
had some kind of accident.

08:50.100 --> 08:51.633
- You hurt her...

08:51.700 --> 08:54.567
you're dead.

08:54.633 --> 08:57.467
You fuck with my parole,
you're dead.

08:57.533 --> 09:02.000
- Oh, you're so fuckin'
beautiful when you're angry.

09:03.934 --> 09:05.800
- All right, Mr. Alvarez,

09:05.867 --> 09:07.333
that was a very lovely
speech you just made.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.533
But now we'd like
to ask you some questions.

09:09.600 --> 09:12.066
- Mr. Dawkins, you can
ask me whatever you want.

09:12.133 --> 09:15.066
- You were convicted of
beating a 75-year-old man,

09:15.133 --> 09:16.734
then cutting his face,

09:16.800 --> 09:18.467
all because
his car scraped yours.

09:18.533 --> 09:21.467
- Yeah.
I wasn't myself that day.

09:21.533 --> 09:23.767
- Once you were here in Oswald,
you cut your own face

09:23.834 --> 09:26.300
and later tried to
hang yourself in your cell.

09:26.367 --> 09:28.767
Were you yourself
either of those days?

09:28.834 --> 09:32.133
- Last year you masterminded
an escape from Oswald.

09:32.200 --> 09:34.567
- I didn't
mastermind an escape.

09:34.633 --> 09:37.233
Busmalis was digging a tunnel,
and I was fearing for my life--

09:37.300 --> 09:39.000
- You were one of the major
leaders in the riot

09:39.066 --> 09:40.633
and hurt a number of people,

09:40.700 --> 09:42.700
including an officer,
Joseph Mineo.

09:42.767 --> 09:44.433
- He was making a move on me--

09:44.500 --> 09:47.066
- Later, you poked out the eyes
of another officer,

09:47.133 --> 09:48.800
Eugene Rivera.

09:48.867 --> 09:50.367
Then you murdered
two fellow prisoners,

09:50.433 --> 09:53.000
Carlo Ricardo
and a Jorge Vasquez.

09:53.066 --> 09:55.834
So, my question is,

09:55.900 --> 09:59.333
what the fuck makes you think
we should set you free,

09:59.400 --> 10:01.500
you little prick?

10:06.166 --> 10:08.500
- Knock it off!

10:08.567 --> 10:10.233
Knock it off!

10:10.300 --> 10:12.266
- Let him go, Alvarez!

10:12.333 --> 10:14.333
- Fuck!

10:14.400 --> 10:16.000
This is fuckin' bullshit!

10:16.066 --> 10:17.900
I'm fuckin' tellin' them--

10:17.967 --> 10:19.767
I'm trying to tell them
how I got rehabilitated.

10:19.834 --> 10:21.633
Fuckin' bullshit!

10:21.700 --> 10:24.900
He asked me how I think
I changed in all this bullshit.

10:24.967 --> 10:27.734
I'm talking to him and I'm
trying to explain how I changed.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.567
Are you listening to me?
- McManus, I gotta talk to you

10:29.633 --> 10:30.934
about my trial.
- He just fuckin' cuts me off.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.333
He just cuts me off.
- Come on, man.

10:32.400 --> 10:33.567
I'm lonely.
- McManus.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.367
- I'm afraid!
- You listening to me?

10:35.433 --> 10:38.000
- Montgomery is a cunt
that got what he deserved.

10:38.066 --> 10:39.467
Cunt!
- I'm afraid!

10:39.533 --> 10:42.166
- Hey, that CO had no right
to shove my face in shit.

10:42.233 --> 10:43.166
- Cunt!
- Get me out of here.

10:43.233 --> 10:44.934
Get me the fuck outta here!

10:45.000 --> 10:46.800
- I'm afraid.
- Cunt!

10:46.867 --> 10:48.734
- Get me the fuck
outta here!

10:48.800 --> 10:50.233
- McManus.
- Cunt!

10:50.300 --> 10:51.433
- McManus!

11:11.300 --> 11:12.767
It's quittin' time.

11:12.834 --> 11:14.967
You promised
to buy me a drink.

11:15.033 --> 11:16.867
I really need
that fuckin' drink.

11:16.934 --> 11:18.667
Let's go.
- I'm sorry, Tim.

11:18.734 --> 11:20.567
I'm gonna have to take a pass.

11:20.633 --> 11:22.133
I don't want to leave Pancamo.

11:22.200 --> 11:24.667
- You know...

11:24.734 --> 11:28.767
I've been dumped by a lot
of women for a lot of guys,

11:28.834 --> 11:30.834
but never one in a coma.

11:30.900 --> 11:32.433
- Ohh...he could die, Tim.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.433
It's my fault.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.000
A man comes into my E.R.

11:36.066 --> 11:37.867
with a non life-threatening
stab wound,

11:37.934 --> 11:39.834
gets infected
and goes into toxic shock.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.734
I didn't take proper care
of him before,

11:41.800 --> 11:43.767
but I sure as hell am not
gonna let him die alone.

11:43.834 --> 11:46.033
- How about a cup
of coffee?

11:46.100 --> 11:47.734
- Okay.

11:58.667 --> 12:00.767
There you go.

12:02.500 --> 12:03.867
- You ever met my wife--

12:03.934 --> 12:06.100
my ex-wife,
Eleanor O'Connor?

12:06.166 --> 12:08.633
- Our paths have yet
to cross.

12:08.700 --> 12:11.100
- We've been divorced
five years.

12:11.166 --> 12:13.934
When I was first offered
the job at Oswald

12:14.000 --> 12:17.333
to build Em City,
to fulfill a lifelong dream,

12:17.400 --> 12:19.333
she didn't want to trail along.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.133
You know,
she had this great job,

12:21.200 --> 12:24.900
she didn't want to leave,
so...I just walked out.

12:24.967 --> 12:27.467
And for five years,
I've, uh...

12:27.533 --> 12:30.233
I've carried the guilt
of that.

12:30.300 --> 12:32.533
I mean, every time
something goes haywire,

12:32.600 --> 12:35.200
I just think, you know,
fuck.

12:35.266 --> 12:37.400
I could be with Ellie

12:37.467 --> 12:39.600
and maybe by now
we'd have a couple of kids...

12:39.667 --> 12:41.700
- Ohh...don't talk to me
about regret.

12:41.767 --> 12:43.266
I own the patent.

12:43.333 --> 12:44.900
- Well, my point is...

12:44.967 --> 12:49.600
today I was
walking in solitary and...

12:49.667 --> 12:52.500
I was surrounded
by all my mistakes,

12:52.567 --> 12:55.066
and my head was gonna explode.

12:55.133 --> 12:58.100
But then I thought
about Omar White,

12:58.166 --> 13:01.567
about how hard it was
to turn him around.

13:01.633 --> 13:05.000
But we did it.

13:05.066 --> 13:07.700
I mean, we can't
save them all, Gloria,

13:07.767 --> 13:11.133
but if we can save just one,

13:11.200 --> 13:12.767
that's enough.

13:14.834 --> 13:18.266
- And I want to save Pancamo.

13:21.433 --> 13:23.333
Well...

13:23.400 --> 13:25.667
thanks for the coffee.

13:25.734 --> 13:28.400
Now I'm gonna
get myself a real drink.

13:28.467 --> 13:29.867
- Good night.

13:41.600 --> 13:42.533
- Come on!

13:42.600 --> 13:43.900
Take his head off!

13:45.066 --> 13:46.867
- Oh! Oh, God!

13:46.934 --> 13:47.967
No!

13:48.033 --> 13:51.367
- Prisoner number 0-2-C-7-7-3,

13:51.433 --> 13:52.567
Wolfgang Cutler,

13:52.633 --> 13:55.600
convicted February 20, 2002,

13:55.667 --> 13:57.200
murder in the first degree.

13:57.266 --> 13:59.300
Sentence--
life imprisonment

13:59.367 --> 14:01.934
without the possibility
of parole.

14:06.433 --> 14:09.000
- I want into
the brotherhood.

14:09.066 --> 14:11.300
- You know the deal,
Wolfgang.

14:12.667 --> 14:14.800
You gotta demonstrate
your fearlessness.

14:14.867 --> 14:17.233
By whacking somebody?

14:17.300 --> 14:19.166
Who?
- Killing a nigger's

14:19.233 --> 14:21.300
always nice.

14:21.367 --> 14:23.000
The higher up the better.

14:23.066 --> 14:25.033
- Kareem Said.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.467
- I like the way you think.

14:34.967 --> 14:37.700
- Omar, you ready
for some hot gossip?

14:37.767 --> 14:39.600
- Hmm?
- I overheard the Aryans

14:39.667 --> 14:42.100
in the gym.
That new guy, Wolfgang Cutler,

14:42.166 --> 14:45.800
he was bragging to the others
how he was gonna kill Said.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.834
- Yo, you Cutler?

14:55.900 --> 14:57.500
- How the fuck
did you get back here?

14:57.567 --> 15:01.266
-  That don't matter.
Look, I came 'cause

15:01.333 --> 15:03.567
I heard a rumor and shit,
all right?

15:03.633 --> 15:05.667
Just stay away from Said,
all right?

15:05.734 --> 15:07.033
No, no,
whatever you got brewing,

15:07.100 --> 15:08.633
just--just stop it, okay?

15:08.700 --> 15:10.767
- I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

15:10.834 --> 15:12.367
And get the fuck
out of here.

15:12.433 --> 15:14.533
- I'm trying to be
diplomatic here, okay?

15:14.600 --> 15:16.900
- And I'm telling you,
get the fuck outta here!

15:16.967 --> 15:18.800
- Look, I've been
pretty good lately.

15:18.867 --> 15:20.533
You don't want
to see me bad, okay?

15:20.600 --> 15:21.934
You touch Said...

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
- And what?

15:24.066 --> 15:26.834
Nigger, you gonna cry?

15:26.900 --> 15:28.500
Fuck you!

15:28.567 --> 15:30.667
- Hey, hey--

15:30.734 --> 15:32.200
Fuck you!

15:35.800 --> 15:38.367
Fuck! Little fuck--Fuck!
- Motherfucker...

15:38.433 --> 15:41.500
Stay away!
Stay away!

15:41.567 --> 15:42.600
Stay away!

15:42.667 --> 15:44.200
- You motherfucker!

15:44.266 --> 15:46.200
I'm gonna fucking kill you...

15:46.266 --> 15:48.900
fuckin' black motherfucker!

15:48.967 --> 15:51.700
-  Shh!
Don't touch Said!

15:51.767 --> 15:53.367
Stay away!

15:53.433 --> 15:55.567
Stay the fuck away from Said!

15:55.633 --> 15:58.200
Stay the fuck away.

15:58.266 --> 16:00.367
Stay--stay the fuck--

16:02.533 --> 16:05.066
Shh, what's that?

16:05.133 --> 16:07.767
What's that, Cutler?
Cutler?

16:07.834 --> 16:10.266
Cutler...Cutler?

16:10.333 --> 16:11.800
Hey, hey.

16:11.867 --> 16:15.200
Cutler...come on.

16:15.266 --> 16:16.800
Come on, man.

16:16.867 --> 16:20.166
Hey, Cutler.
Cutler!

16:20.233 --> 16:22.333
Come on, man,
don't do this to me.

16:22.400 --> 16:25.066
Don't fuckin' die.
Oh, shit.

16:25.133 --> 16:26.567
Fuck.

16:35.467 --> 16:38.600
Oh, shit, fuck!

16:40.934 --> 16:44.734
Fuck! I almost
killed the motherfucker!

16:44.800 --> 16:46.500
I mean, look, it's not
like I started anything!

16:46.567 --> 16:48.333
The motherfucker was just all up
in my shit, man, I don't know,

16:48.400 --> 16:49.767
taunting me and shit, man.

16:49.834 --> 16:51.066
I don't know
what the fuck happened.

16:51.133 --> 16:52.567
- Omar, slow down.
Who you talking about?

16:52.633 --> 16:54.600
- Cutler's getting ready
to jack you!

16:54.667 --> 16:56.367
- Wolfgang Cutler.
- Look...

16:56.433 --> 16:57.967
the motherfucker's
still alive, okay?

16:58.033 --> 16:59.667
In a second, the fuckin' hacks
are gonna be up here

16:59.734 --> 17:01.467
punching in my fuckin' ass,
shit!

17:01.533 --> 17:05.200
Fuck, fuck!
- Omar...

17:05.266 --> 17:07.767
you follow me, you do
not stop, you understand?

17:11.900 --> 17:15.200
- But I saved him, both of them,
I mean, Cutler and Said.

17:15.266 --> 17:18.233
- What do you want?
Do you want a fucking medal?

17:18.300 --> 17:20.066
You almost killed a man.

17:20.133 --> 17:23.033
Do you understand that,
God damn it!

17:23.100 --> 17:25.433
I give you
ten second chances.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.033
This is what I get in return!

17:27.100 --> 17:28.600
I bend over
backwards for you!

17:28.667 --> 17:31.233
As a result,
a man ends up almost dead.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.133
You want me to be
fuckin' happy about that?

17:33.200 --> 17:35.400
- McManus,
it is not that simple.

17:35.467 --> 17:37.367
Miss O'Connor--
- Yes, it is

17:37.433 --> 17:39.266
that fuckin' simple, Said.

17:39.333 --> 17:41.100
Don't you be looking
to her for help.

17:41.166 --> 17:42.900
I've made by decision.

17:42.967 --> 17:44.600
The rulebook says Solitary.

17:44.667 --> 17:46.400
I'm playing by
the rulebook this time.

17:46.467 --> 17:48.300
- No, McMan--
- And if he had done this

17:48.367 --> 17:50.734
to protect you instead of me,
would you be sending him away?

17:50.800 --> 17:52.667
- Shut up,
or you're going with him.

17:52.734 --> 17:55.367
- McManus!
McManus!

17:55.433 --> 17:57.000
McManus!

18:00.600 --> 18:02.333
- That wasn't for you,
Ellie.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.800
- No, no, that was
genuine rage.

18:04.867 --> 18:07.800
I remember it well.

18:14.667 --> 18:17.300
Tim...

18:17.367 --> 18:18.800
you think I divorced you

18:18.867 --> 18:20.367
because you wanted
to come to Oswald

18:20.433 --> 18:22.533
and build Emerald City,
but that's not true.

18:22.600 --> 18:25.200
You want to know
what made me leave?

18:25.266 --> 18:27.300
Your relentless, unflappable,

18:27.367 --> 18:29.934
never-say-never idealism.

18:31.233 --> 18:33.333
- You would have
preferred me cynical?

18:33.400 --> 18:37.834
- No! You want to
save the world,

18:37.900 --> 18:39.266
and when you
realize you can't,

18:39.333 --> 18:41.700
you crucify yourself
and everyone around you.

18:41.767 --> 18:45.834
This nonsense where it's up
to you  to change everything

18:45.900 --> 18:49.033
for the better--
your wife, your prisoners,

18:49.100 --> 18:51.834
whoever else until
we all fit your ideals--

18:51.900 --> 18:55.767
isn't it time to see that
for the pride that it is?

18:55.834 --> 18:57.734
- Go on.

18:57.800 --> 18:59.934
- No.

19:04.033 --> 19:05.667
I'll just go.

19:18.333 --> 19:19.533
- Minister?

19:19.600 --> 19:23.333
- Look, whatever it is
that you want...

19:23.400 --> 19:24.233
it can wait.

19:24.300 --> 19:26.200
- What I want is for you

19:26.266 --> 19:29.900
not to blame yourself for
what happened to Omar White.

19:29.967 --> 19:32.133
- Well, like I said,
what you want...

19:33.867 --> 19:35.934
Can wait.

marital discord,

20:27.033 --> 20:29.567
job stress,
financial worries.

20:29.633 --> 20:32.734
That's right, a little salary
can make a hard man soft.

20:32.800 --> 20:37.266
A drop in the Dow can
diminish rising expectations.

20:46.834 --> 20:48.567
- That was my son.

20:48.633 --> 20:50.734
Alex Jr.'s
days away from death.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.867
- Gosh, Bob,
what are you gonna do ?

20:52.934 --> 20:54.166
- What can I do?

20:54.233 --> 20:55.900
I'll wait for the call
that tells me

20:55.967 --> 20:57.767
that my grandson's life
is over.

20:57.834 --> 21:00.200
- No, you gotta see him.
- How?

21:00.266 --> 21:01.567
He's in intensive care.

21:01.633 --> 21:03.533
He can't even
leave the hospital,

21:03.600 --> 21:05.467
let alone visit a prison.

21:05.533 --> 21:06.667
- Then you go to him.

21:06.734 --> 21:08.967
- They'd never let me.
- Why not?

21:09.033 --> 21:10.467
McManus has been
helpful in the past.

21:10.533 --> 21:14.533
Go. Ask him.

21:16.433 --> 21:19.767
- You can cuff me,
shackle me,

21:19.834 --> 21:22.533
gag me if you have to--
just let me see Alex,

21:22.600 --> 21:26.100
make eye contact

21:26.166 --> 21:29.133
so that he knows
that his granddad loves him.

21:32.133 --> 21:34.266
- I remember when
you took up that collection

21:34.333 --> 21:36.533
to take him
to Adventure Country.

21:36.600 --> 21:38.767
- That trip meant
a lot to him.

21:38.834 --> 21:41.533
It did to me, too.

21:41.600 --> 21:44.066
Not only you
wanting to raise the cash

21:44.133 --> 21:47.600
but then actually rallying
these dinks to help you.

21:49.166 --> 21:51.033
- So...

21:51.100 --> 21:52.200
may I go?

21:54.834 --> 21:57.633
- Yes.

21:57.700 --> 22:02.133
And gagless,
shackle-less even.

22:02.200 --> 22:03.934
I'll arrange the visit today.

22:06.433 --> 22:08.700
- Are you traveling with me?
- No.

22:08.767 --> 22:10.500
Handing you off
at the door.

22:10.567 --> 22:13.266
- I was once sentenced
to die, you know.

22:13.333 --> 22:16.367
- I remember
something about that.

22:17.633 --> 22:21.367
- A power failure shut down
the electric chair.

22:21.433 --> 22:24.367
My death was
commuted to life...

22:25.800 --> 22:27.166
Legally.

22:29.200 --> 22:32.834
I only wish there were laws
that could do the same for Alex.

22:35.233 --> 22:39.467
But only God can grant
that kind of reprieve.

23:03.767 --> 23:06.967
- Chugga-chugga,
chugga-chugga,

23:07.033 --> 23:08.400
chugga-chugga!

23:08.467 --> 23:11.000
- This is the best
"Miss Sally" ever.

23:11.066 --> 23:13.533
- Mail call!

23:14.166 --> 23:16.066
- What you got for me,
Vern?

23:17.166 --> 23:18.867
Mr. Schillinger.

23:21.367 --> 23:24.367
- Stinkin' with cheap perfume.

23:25.567 --> 23:27.967
- It's from Norma.

23:29.734 --> 23:32.800
Hey, Fiona, would you
do me a favor?

23:32.867 --> 23:35.834
This letter's
from my former fiancee.

23:35.900 --> 23:38.200
Would you mind
reading it to me?

23:38.266 --> 23:41.166
Make me kind of feel like
she's here in the room.

23:41.233 --> 23:43.100
- Hey, we all got our trip.

23:43.166 --> 23:45.400
- "Dear Agamemmnon,

23:45.467 --> 23:48.500
"I got very depressed after
'Miss Sally' was canceled,

23:48.567 --> 23:50.600
and I lost my job.
- Mmm. Poor thing.

23:50.667 --> 23:53.100
- "But the one thing that
hasn't been canceled

23:53.166 --> 23:55.867
"is my love for you, and I'm
coming to visit on the 15th

23:55.934 --> 23:59.166
"to explain why I never
showed up on our wedding day.

23:59.233 --> 24:01.166
"If you can find it
in your heart,

24:01.233 --> 24:04.367
please see me.
Love always, Norma."

24:04.433 --> 24:06.100
Ah, well,
ain't that sweet?

24:06.166 --> 24:09.000
- The 15th.
That's today.

24:13.667 --> 24:14.600
Norma!

24:14.667 --> 24:15.700
- Hello, Agamemmnon.

24:15.767 --> 24:17.734
Wait!

24:20.033 --> 24:21.000
Surprise.

24:51.200 --> 24:52.967
- Hey, Bob,

24:53.033 --> 24:56.400
how'd the visit
with little Alex go?

24:56.467 --> 24:58.300
- Tired.

25:00.467 --> 25:02.734
- Guess what happened
while you were gone.

25:08.633 --> 25:10.967
I'll tell you tomorrow.

25:21.834 --> 25:26.934
If you want, we can
talk more about little Alex.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.233
- I have nothing else to say.

25:29.300 --> 25:31.834
I'm on the death watch.

25:35.500 --> 25:37.200
I fold.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.700
- Bob, you've gotta
get some rest.

26:13.667 --> 26:15.800
- Did you see that?

26:15.867 --> 26:18.767
- See what?

26:20.400 --> 26:22.533
- He's gone.

26:29.433 --> 26:30.567
- Count!

26:30.633 --> 26:34.467
- Uh, y-your grandson
was stable,

26:34.533 --> 26:37.400
but the storm--

26:37.467 --> 26:40.233
Well, the electricity
went out for a minute,

26:40.300 --> 26:44.834
and, uh, the surge
scrambled his equipment.

26:44.900 --> 26:46.934
- And?

26:47.000 --> 26:50.066
- Uh, I-I'm sorry.
Alex died.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.867
- I need help.

27:08.400 --> 27:09.700
- Hey.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.400
I'm real sorry
about little Alex.

27:13.467 --> 27:20.000
- You know, you try
to prepare for a death...

27:20.066 --> 27:24.233
but always secretly
you believe there's a chance

27:24.300 --> 27:26.967
that the doctors were wrong,
that they'll find a cure,

27:27.033 --> 27:32.500
and that as long as
he's alive there's time.

27:32.567 --> 27:34.133
So while you think
you're steeling yourself

27:34.200 --> 27:35.934
for the sorrow,
what you're really doing

27:36.000 --> 27:38.800
is waiting on the miracle.

27:38.867 --> 27:41.367
Which is why,
when death comes,

27:41.433 --> 27:43.967
it's so horrible,
because you realize...

27:44.033 --> 27:46.333
you weren't prepared at all.

27:46.400 --> 27:50.033
- But you knew last night.

27:50.100 --> 27:51.633
- On some level.

27:53.700 --> 27:57.033
30-something years ago,
it was a power outage

27:57.100 --> 28:00.900
that saved me from execution,
but last night the electricity

28:00.967 --> 28:05.100
finally came back on
to finish the job,

28:05.166 --> 28:08.200
except so much time had passed

28:08.266 --> 28:11.166
that my grandson
was now in the chair.

28:19.233 --> 28:20.567
Ah...

28:23.367 --> 28:26.700
Never really liked this hat.

28:26.767 --> 28:27.967
But now that
he's passed away,

28:28.033 --> 28:30.233
I understand this hat.

28:34.600 --> 28:38.800
This was my grandson
at his most alive.

28:44.667 --> 28:47.166
- So I'm going to let Rebadow
go to the funeral.

28:47.233 --> 28:51.734
- Jesus. For 35 years,
he gets out twice in one week,

28:51.800 --> 28:53.834
and all for the worst reasons.

28:53.900 --> 28:56.700
- Holy shit.

28:59.533 --> 29:00.934
- I'm back.

29:05.033 --> 29:06.567
I decided...

29:06.633 --> 29:09.333
to give Rebadow his money.

29:09.400 --> 29:11.400
I decided he should
help his grandkid.

29:15.367 --> 29:17.400
- New studies show
that even Viagra,

29:17.467 --> 29:19.700
which is supposed to help
a fella get an erection,

29:19.767 --> 29:21.567
can sometimes
cause problems in young,

29:21.633 --> 29:24.433
sexually active men who use
the drug recreationally.

29:24.500 --> 29:27.266
You see, if an erection
lasts longer than six hours,

29:27.333 --> 29:30.667
the blood supply
gets cut off permanently.

29:30.734 --> 29:32.400
Of course,
after six hours, you know,

29:32.467 --> 29:35.266
maybe you don't give a shit.

29:35.333 --> 29:37.266
You know what I mean.

29:45.600 --> 29:48.133
- Your father and I went
to Adam Guenzel's funeral.

29:48.200 --> 29:51.033
When I saw Olivia walking down
the center aisle of the church,

29:51.100 --> 29:55.433
so crippled up with arthritis,
moving so slowly,

29:55.500 --> 29:57.633
each step measured,
supported by a cane,

29:57.700 --> 30:00.433
my heart--my heart broke.

30:00.500 --> 30:03.934
You know, when you
were first arrested,

30:04.000 --> 30:07.133
Olivia Guenzel was one of
the few friends who stood by us,

30:07.200 --> 30:08.867
and there we were,

30:08.934 --> 30:12.734
burying her grandson
who caused her so much...

30:12.800 --> 30:14.533
shame.

30:14.600 --> 30:16.467
- I'm sorry.

30:18.033 --> 30:20.800
I couldn't protect him.

30:20.867 --> 30:25.667
- I know.
I know you did your best.

30:29.233 --> 30:32.433
Funny,
when I hugged Olivia,

30:32.500 --> 30:36.767
when I saw the grief
in her eyes,

30:36.834 --> 30:39.533
I thought...

30:39.600 --> 30:42.133
"Good.

30:42.200 --> 30:44.867
now you really do understand."

30:49.867 --> 30:52.633
God forgive me.

30:54.867 --> 30:57.333
I almost forgot...

30:59.400 --> 31:02.867
Holly sent you this.

31:04.100 --> 31:06.133
Happy Valentine's Day.

31:11.967 --> 31:13.834
- Winthrop...
- Get away from me, Beecher.

31:13.900 --> 31:15.200
- Hey,
I need to talk to you.

31:15.266 --> 31:16.667
- I gotta get this food
to Schillinger

31:16.734 --> 31:18.567
or he'll kick my ass.
- Look, I've been where you are.

31:18.633 --> 31:19.834
You don't have to be
Schillinger's bitch.

31:19.900 --> 31:22.100
- Yeah, right.
- I can help you.

31:22.166 --> 31:25.433
- Like you helped Adam?
No fuckin' thanks.

31:35.066 --> 31:36.734
- Sister,
at our last interaction,

31:36.800 --> 31:38.834
you were asking
about Adam Guenzel,

31:38.900 --> 31:42.100
about the circumstances
surrounding his rape,

31:42.166 --> 31:46.233
and I kept silent at the time
because of...

31:48.633 --> 31:50.033
Because of my own involvement.

31:51.700 --> 31:55.667
Now I think, had I spoken
and told what I knew,

31:55.734 --> 31:56.967
Adam might still be alive--
- Beecher.

31:57.033 --> 31:59.100
- Vern, you know the rules.

31:59.166 --> 32:01.000
No interruptions.

32:01.066 --> 32:02.533
Go on.

32:02.600 --> 32:05.700
- Yes, go on.

32:07.100 --> 32:10.500
- Though it's too late
to save Adam,

32:10.567 --> 32:12.133
I think being honest might...

32:12.200 --> 32:14.266
- Might what?

32:14.333 --> 32:16.200
We're all getting along
so well these days.

32:16.266 --> 32:17.400
- Vern!
- No.

32:17.467 --> 32:20.033
He starts making
wrongful accusations,

32:20.100 --> 32:23.734
all the good work
you've done here will unravel.

32:23.800 --> 32:25.133
You don't want that,
sister, do ya?

32:25.200 --> 32:27.100
- I want him to speak his mind.

32:27.166 --> 32:29.200
- Well, I'm not gonna sit here
and listen to this horse shit.

32:29.266 --> 32:31.033
- That's your choice.
Officers.

32:31.100 --> 32:33.000
- Beecher,
tread very carefully.

32:33.066 --> 32:36.433
- You tell the truth,
Tobias.

32:36.500 --> 32:37.767
Just tell the truth.

32:37.834 --> 32:40.200
- Take Said to his unit.
Beecher stays here.

32:50.867 --> 32:53.066
- In accordance with
D.O.C. regulations,

32:53.133 --> 32:55.433
this committee has
given you a fair hearing.

32:55.500 --> 32:57.900
We have listened to
testimony from witnesses

32:57.967 --> 32:59.233
and examined evidence.

32:59.300 --> 33:00.767
We have determined
the following--

33:00.834 --> 33:03.100
one, that you conspired to

33:03.166 --> 33:05.500
and engaged in the rape
of Adam Guenzel,

33:05.567 --> 33:07.433
two, that you conspired to

33:07.500 --> 33:10.166
and engaged in the rape
of Franklin Winthrop.

33:10.233 --> 33:12.633
We find you guilty
of these charges

33:12.700 --> 33:15.734
and have decided that you will
be transferred immediately

33:15.800 --> 33:19.000
to solitary confinement for
an undetermined length of time.

33:19.066 --> 33:21.333
- Hey, Vern!

33:24.500 --> 33:26.667
- Nice color.

33:39.700 --> 33:41.600
- Chris...

33:41.667 --> 33:43.333
how'd the trial go?

33:43.400 --> 33:45.533
- Fantastic.
A jury of my peers

33:45.600 --> 33:47.400
found me guilty of murder
in the first degree.

33:47.467 --> 33:49.400
Oh, God.

33:49.467 --> 33:51.133
- And my idiot lawyers
are going to appeal,

33:51.200 --> 33:53.166
but he doesn't
hold out much hope.

33:53.233 --> 33:55.567
I go back, uh...

33:55.633 --> 33:57.700
Thursday to the courthouse
for sentencing,

33:57.767 --> 34:00.900
and more than likely...

34:00.967 --> 34:03.100
I'll get the death penalty.

34:03.166 --> 34:04.934
- Well, I'll do ev--

34:06.133 --> 34:09.233
I'll do everything
I can to help.

34:09.300 --> 34:11.633
- Show me your tits.

34:12.734 --> 34:14.300
- Don't do that.

34:14.367 --> 34:17.467
- I'm sorry.

34:17.533 --> 34:19.433
I guess I'm in a bad mood.

34:20.767 --> 34:23.667
It's not every day
you get sentenced to death.

34:25.400 --> 34:30.133
Weird. All these years
my penis has dominated my life,

34:30.200 --> 34:33.200
forced me to go in
whatever direction...

34:33.266 --> 34:35.867
"it" chose.

34:37.400 --> 34:41.433
Now I want to share
my love with someone, and...

34:41.500 --> 34:43.200
I never will.

34:43.266 --> 34:45.300
You know, there are people

34:45.367 --> 34:47.734
out there
who are fighting against

34:47.800 --> 34:49.834
the return
of the death penalty.

34:49.900 --> 34:52.734
- Tell that to
Shirley Bellinger.

34:52.800 --> 34:55.233
You know,
on the ride over here,

34:55.300 --> 34:57.433
I was thinking about
how I wanted to die.

34:57.500 --> 34:59.700
- Well, there's only
two choices now,

34:59.767 --> 35:02.934
lethal injection and, uh,

35:03.033 --> 35:04.633
the electric chair.

35:04.700 --> 35:08.433
I want the chair.

35:08.500 --> 35:10.066
I want the juice.

35:12.200 --> 35:14.433
I want to go out on a charge.

35:17.367 --> 35:19.467
- Christopher Keller
was convicted today

35:19.533 --> 35:21.433
in the brutal slaying
of Brice Tibbetts.

35:21.500 --> 35:23.867
Tibbetts was tortured,
sodomized, and murdered

35:23.934 --> 35:25.567
in July of 1997.

35:25.633 --> 35:27.500
Keller,
who faces the death penalty,

35:27.567 --> 35:31.166
will be sentenced on Thursday
by Judge Grace Lema.

35:31.233 --> 35:32.700
Keller is suspected of
committing

35:32.767 --> 35:34.700
at least
two similar murders.

35:34.767 --> 35:37.600
And additional charges...
- Fuck. I have to go see him.

35:37.667 --> 35:39.333
- May I remind you of
your promise to yourself

35:39.400 --> 35:41.166
never to speak
to Keller again?

35:41.233 --> 35:42.333
- Yeah.
Well, the great thing about

35:42.400 --> 35:43.800
breaking a promise to yourself

35:43.867 --> 35:46.633
is only one person gets hurt,
and I can live with my guilt

35:46.700 --> 35:48.500
a shitload easier than I can
live without ever seeing Keller.

35:48.567 --> 35:51.166
- No, no, no, this is wrong.

35:51.233 --> 35:53.934
- How is love wrong, Kareem?

35:54.000 --> 35:56.800
In whatever form it takes,
how is love wrong?

35:56.867 --> 35:59.033
E-especially here in Oz,

35:59.100 --> 36:01.533
where there's so little of it.

36:01.600 --> 36:07.367
You and I...
we love each other.

36:07.433 --> 36:11.200
You stabbed Schillinger
and Robson for me.

36:11.266 --> 36:13.934
But the Aryans say
that any sort of love

36:14.000 --> 36:16.200
between the races
is a perversion.

36:16.266 --> 36:17.967
Who decides these things?

36:18.033 --> 36:20.166
Who chooses which love
is permissible?

36:20.233 --> 36:22.567
- God.

36:22.633 --> 36:24.500
- The god I worship...

36:24.567 --> 36:26.200
loves everybody,
and he created a universe

36:26.266 --> 36:27.667
full of different
kinds of people

36:27.734 --> 36:29.300
sharing different
kinds of love.

36:29.367 --> 36:31.133
- Allah says, "Man"--

36:31.200 --> 36:33.567
- Don't quote scripture
to me, Kareem.

36:33.633 --> 36:35.000
- You know
what's gonna happen

36:35.066 --> 36:36.533
when you go
and see Keller again.

36:36.600 --> 36:38.500
- I'm not gonna fuck him.

36:38.567 --> 36:40.734
I'm just gonna
let him know I care

36:40.800 --> 36:43.400
that he's not totally alone.

36:43.467 --> 36:46.066
I think Allah
would approve of that.

36:51.767 --> 36:55.800
- Here you go, Keller,
your brand-new home.

36:55.867 --> 36:57.667
They say the ghost
of Shirley Bellinger

36:57.734 --> 36:59.433
still haunts this cell.

36:59.500 --> 37:00.667
- Oh, yeah?

37:00.734 --> 37:02.467
- When the moon is full,

37:02.533 --> 37:05.400
you can still
smell her vagina.

37:08.233 --> 37:10.633
- You're a very funny guy
there, Lopresti.

37:10.700 --> 37:12.066
You should think
about doing comedy.

37:15.333 --> 37:17.533
- Hey, how you doing?

37:36.667 --> 37:38.000
Chris.

37:43.567 --> 37:45.367
You got mail.

38:16.800 --> 38:20.600
- Diabetes,
multiple sclerosis,

38:20.667 --> 38:22.400
Alzheimer's,
Parkinson's,

38:22.467 --> 38:24.867
high blood pressure,
obesity,

38:24.934 --> 38:27.533
aging can all cause impotence.

38:27.600 --> 38:29.133
So can riding a bicycle.

38:29.200 --> 38:31.533
You put that hard seat
between your legs,

38:31.600 --> 38:33.900
there may be nothing else
hard between your legs

38:33.967 --> 38:37.200
for a long, long time.

38:39.600 --> 38:41.767
- Quiet down!

38:41.834 --> 38:43.033
- Come on, man!

38:44.367 --> 38:46.166
- Get up.

38:50.967 --> 38:52.400
Leave it.

38:52.467 --> 38:54.800
- No.
- Leave it.

39:05.166 --> 39:08.367
- Fuckin' retard.
- Hang in there, Cyril.

39:21.734 --> 39:23.567
- Where is this?

39:23.633 --> 39:26.233
- End of the line.

39:26.300 --> 39:28.834
- I'm not supposed to
be here.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.934
Where's...Jericho?

39:31.000 --> 39:32.300
- Relax.
- Where's Jericho?

39:32.367 --> 39:34.400
- Relax!
- Jericho--

39:34.467 --> 39:36.033
- Oh!

39:36.100 --> 39:39.533
- Ryan!
- Let's go, retard boy!

39:39.600 --> 39:41.333
-  Ryan!

39:43.567 --> 39:45.000
Ryan!

39:45.066 --> 39:46.300
- No, man, cut that out!

39:46.367 --> 39:47.900
- I'm not supposed to be here!

39:47.967 --> 39:51.266
I'm not supposed to be here!

39:51.333 --> 39:52.967
No!

39:53.166 --> 39:55.367
- Finally the Sort Team
had to subdue your brother.

39:55.433 --> 39:56.567
- Christ.

39:56.633 --> 39:58.400
- I gave him some Haldol
to calm him down,

39:58.467 --> 40:00.333
but as we learned
from previous episodes,

40:00.400 --> 40:01.967
it's just a stopgap measure.

40:02.033 --> 40:04.700
It's never gonna
be a long-term solution

40:04.767 --> 40:06.367
to Cyril's violent episodes.

40:06.433 --> 40:07.967
- We don't need
a long-term solution.

40:08.033 --> 40:11.834
The judge has set
his execution for next month.

40:11.900 --> 40:13.033
- What?

40:13.100 --> 40:14.934
- Why are you acting
so surprised?

40:15.000 --> 40:17.367
He was found guilty of
the murder of Li Chen.

40:17.433 --> 40:19.100
The punishment is death.

40:19.166 --> 40:20.900
Look...

40:20.967 --> 40:22.934
you're gonna have to
discuss with Cyril

40:23.000 --> 40:24.266
the way he wants to die,

40:24.333 --> 40:26.200
either the electric chair
or lethal injection.

40:26.266 --> 40:28.000
- Lethal injection.

40:28.066 --> 40:30.700
Yeah, I want Cyril just
to doze off and go to sleep.

40:30.767 --> 40:33.867
- There's more to it than that.

40:33.934 --> 40:36.767
The drugs they inject into
his body

40:36.834 --> 40:38.100
- Oh, yeah...
- First paralyze him...

40:38.166 --> 40:40.333
- I don't want
to hear the details, okay?

40:40.400 --> 40:42.033
- It's not okay, Ryan.

40:42.100 --> 40:43.533
Up to this point,
you resisted all our attempts

40:43.600 --> 40:44.934
to help your brother.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.266
You should know what
his last moments will be like.

40:49.033 --> 40:50.667
- Can I see him?
- Not yet.

40:50.734 --> 40:53.533
I'll allow a visit
once he's settled down.

40:53.600 --> 40:55.734
Take O'Reily back to Em City.

41:02.100 --> 41:03.767
- The guilt or innocence
of Cyril O'Reily

41:03.834 --> 41:05.200
is not at issue here.

41:05.266 --> 41:07.367
The question is whether
the eighth amendment

41:07.433 --> 41:09.567
of our constitution,
which protects us

41:09.633 --> 41:11.667
from cruel
and unusual punishment,

41:11.734 --> 41:13.900
will also protect
Cyril O'Reily,

41:13.967 --> 41:17.100
whose IQ, by the way, is 51.

41:17.166 --> 41:18.867
That's one of the lowest IQs

41:18.934 --> 41:20.500
of any condemned prisoner
on record.

41:20.567 --> 41:23.667
- As a mother,
I appeal, I plead

41:23.734 --> 41:25.667
to all of the other mothers
and fathers out there

41:25.734 --> 41:28.600
to stop the state from
committing this monstrous act.

41:28.667 --> 41:30.700
- Governor Devlin refused
to comment on the demonstration

41:30.767 --> 41:32.467
held outside
the Capitol building.

41:38.467 --> 41:41.166
- You know, Meehan,

41:41.233 --> 41:42.800
you can hold
a million press conferences,

41:42.867 --> 41:45.500
but you're still not gonna
be able to save my brother.

41:45.567 --> 41:47.567
- Well, if I had that attitude,
you'd be right.

41:47.633 --> 41:49.934
But I'm going to prove
you wrong, Mr. O'Reily.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.934
I'm going to show you
the power of prayer,

41:53.000 --> 41:57.133
of hope, and faith
in the almighty.

41:57.200 --> 42:00.000
- Okay, well, while you're at
it, why don't you suck my dick?

42:01.500 --> 42:03.266
- Tch, tch, tch, tch.

42:10.533 --> 42:14.600
- Father Meehan,
are you here for a lesson?

42:14.667 --> 42:18.033
- No, I was only seminarian
booted off the choir.

42:18.100 --> 42:19.667
The prefect said,

42:19.734 --> 42:23.200
"Your voice is
an offense to God."

42:23.266 --> 42:27.533
But you were magnificent on your
television press conference.

42:27.600 --> 42:29.834
- Oh, thanks.
- A veritable firebrand.

42:29.900 --> 42:32.033
- Well, I've had
a lot of practice.

42:32.100 --> 42:35.667
- I want to talk
to you about Ryan.

42:35.734 --> 42:38.767
Ever since I came to OZ,
I've been trying to reach him.

42:38.834 --> 42:42.834
Well, I know that he and Cyril
were brutalized by their father,

42:42.900 --> 42:46.667
and that's enough
to dent any boy's psyche.

42:46.734 --> 42:49.900
But my gut feeling
is there's something more,

42:50.000 --> 42:51.800
that your son
is hiding something,

42:51.867 --> 42:57.300
some naked truth,
some deeper pain.

42:57.367 --> 42:59.000
I was wondering
if you knew anything.

42:59.066 --> 43:02.734
- My greatest regret, Father,
is abandoning my child.

43:02.800 --> 43:05.500
He was just a little baby
when I left,

43:05.567 --> 43:09.934
and until a few months ago,
I've had no contact with him.

43:10.000 --> 43:13.233
- Is there anyone I could ask?

43:13.300 --> 43:15.633
- Well,
certainly not his father,

43:15.700 --> 43:18.633
but maybe Brenda, his aunt.

43:18.700 --> 43:21.100
- Thank you very much,
Brenda.

43:21.166 --> 43:24.700
Yes, we're doing everything
we can for Cyril.

43:24.767 --> 43:28.433
Right.
Well, keep praying.

43:29.200 --> 43:32.233
- Lockdown, lockdown!

43:41.133 --> 43:44.233
- Ryan,
tell me about Carolyn.

43:44.300 --> 43:45.367
- What the fuck
are you talking about?

43:45.433 --> 43:48.867
- Carolyn,
your little sister.

43:48.934 --> 43:50.500
- She's dead.
End of story.

43:50.567 --> 43:52.500
- Well, then don't
tell me the end,

43:52.567 --> 43:54.433
tell me the beginning,
the middle and all--

43:54.500 --> 43:56.433
- Who the fuck told you
about Carolyn?

43:56.500 --> 43:57.567
- Well, that doesn't matter.

43:57.633 --> 44:00.000
Just tell me
your memory of her.

44:00.066 --> 44:01.834
- No.

44:01.900 --> 44:05.100
- She died.
She was barely six months old,

44:05.166 --> 44:07.433
fell out of her crib
and broke her neck.

44:07.500 --> 44:10.934
- Why you doin' this?

44:11.000 --> 44:14.100
- Well, I've seen
how you love your brother,

44:14.166 --> 44:16.433
how you're
protective of him,

44:16.500 --> 44:20.000
yet you're willing
to let him die,

44:20.066 --> 44:22.000
and I was wondering why.

44:22.066 --> 44:23.734
- I thought I told you
this before.

44:23.800 --> 44:26.467
Death is better
than any day in Oz.

44:26.533 --> 44:28.533
Isn't that what you priests
are always preaching,

44:28.600 --> 44:31.333
the upside of
life everlasting

44:31.400 --> 44:33.934
and all that fuckin'
Catholic nonsense?

44:34.000 --> 44:36.400
- Did you have any
responsibility

44:36.467 --> 44:38.200
for Carolyn's death?

44:38.266 --> 44:40.400
Were you taking care of her
when she fell?

44:40.467 --> 44:41.600
- No, I'm not
talking about this.

44:41.667 --> 44:43.300
I haven't spoken
about my little sister

44:43.367 --> 44:46.266
with anyone my entire life,
not even Cyril,

44:46.333 --> 44:48.633
and I'm not about
to start with you!

44:48.700 --> 44:51.467
- So that's what happened.
You think you killed her!

44:51.533 --> 44:52.934
- No.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.900
- So...what did happen?

44:55.967 --> 44:58.066
- Shut up!

44:58.133 --> 45:03.233
- Ryan, now is the time
to speak the truth.

45:03.300 --> 45:06.700
You've been carrying this burden
on your back for far too long.

45:06.767 --> 45:09.967
Whatever you say to me
will stay right here between us.

45:10.033 --> 45:11.800
- No, no.
- Like in confession.

45:11.867 --> 45:13.867
Now, you can finally say
what you want to say

45:13.934 --> 45:15.700
since Carolyn died.

45:15.767 --> 45:17.266
- No, fuck you!

45:17.333 --> 45:20.133
God damn it!

45:20.200 --> 45:21.266
Fuck!

45:30.533 --> 45:33.633
Don't.

45:33.700 --> 45:34.633
- Come on.
-  Please don't.

45:34.700 --> 45:36.467
- Come on.

45:40.166 --> 45:41.900
It's all right.

45:41.967 --> 45:44.133
-  God loves ya.

45:44.734 --> 45:47.066
- God loves ya.

45:47.133 --> 45:49.400
It's all right.

45:51.300 --> 45:57.066
I went to a priest,
and I told him the truth...

45:57.133 --> 45:59.367
and he didn't believe me.

45:59.433 --> 46:01.667
She was so small.

46:01.734 --> 46:03.734
It's my little sister.

46:03.800 --> 46:07.900
- I know. God loves ya.

46:07.967 --> 46:09.600
God loves ya.

46:09.667 --> 46:11.967
- Suddenly I'm famous.

46:12.033 --> 46:14.600
I done six interviews,
newspapers and TV,

46:14.667 --> 46:17.734
ever since that nonsense
with your brother started.

46:17.800 --> 46:20.967
I got to admit, I'm getting
kind of used to the attention.

46:21.033 --> 46:22.500
The guys down at Kelsey's,

46:22.567 --> 46:24.233
they've been buying me
rounds every night.

46:24.300 --> 46:26.200
And there's this broad,
sits at the end of the bar,

46:26.266 --> 46:27.633
she's been flirting with me.

46:27.700 --> 46:29.967
I might just fuck her.

46:31.533 --> 46:34.767
- You gonna see Cyril
while you're in the building?

46:34.834 --> 46:37.300
- Yeah, yeah.
I guess I oughta.

46:37.367 --> 46:41.233
I don't know what the fuck
I'm gonna say to that boy.

46:41.300 --> 46:44.233
- Tell him you love him.
- Oh, yeah, right.

46:44.300 --> 46:46.300
- You ever told Cyril that,
Dad?

46:46.367 --> 46:49.000
Cyril or anyone?

46:49.066 --> 46:50.266
Ma?

46:50.333 --> 46:52.233
Tessie when you were married?

46:52.300 --> 46:54.367
Have the words "I love you"
ever crossed your lips?

46:54.433 --> 46:56.300
Because I never
heard them, not once.

46:56.367 --> 46:58.133
- Don't start with
your whining.

46:58.200 --> 47:00.667
- I'm sorry, I forgot
how sensitive you are.

47:00.734 --> 47:02.934
- You asked me to come.
I'm here.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.667
State your business.

47:06.700 --> 47:10.033
- I want to talk
about Carolyn.

47:10.100 --> 47:11.934
- Carolyn?
- Yeah.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.266
- What about her?

47:13.333 --> 47:16.467
- I want to talk about
the day she died.

47:16.533 --> 47:20.000
I remember her crying,
you know,

47:20.066 --> 47:23.900
non-stop for what
seemed like hours.

47:23.967 --> 47:26.900
Tessie
couldn't get her quiet.

47:26.967 --> 47:29.333
You were drunk
and in a foul mood.

47:29.400 --> 47:31.700
Sit down!
- Fuck you!

47:33.934 --> 47:35.400
- You sit...

47:35.467 --> 47:38.200
Or I finish
telling my story to a cop.

47:45.700 --> 47:48.066
Carolyn was crying

47:48.133 --> 47:50.467
and you took her
from Tessie's arms

47:50.533 --> 47:54.767
and you put your hands
around her and you shook her

47:54.834 --> 47:56.000
and you shook her

47:56.066 --> 47:59.533
and you shook her
until she stopped,

47:59.600 --> 48:02.000
until she went limp
like a rag doll.

48:02.066 --> 48:04.734
- She fell out of her crib.

48:04.800 --> 48:06.600
- No.

48:06.667 --> 48:09.500
I was there, Dad.

48:10.734 --> 48:13.633
I was in the doorway.
I saw what happened.

48:13.700 --> 48:15.467
- You were just a kid.

48:15.533 --> 48:19.800
What the fuck did you
know about anything?

48:19.867 --> 48:24.033
Think my old man didn't beat me,
that fuckin' scumbag?

48:24.100 --> 48:26.500
My life has been
nothing but shit

48:26.567 --> 48:28.066
since the day I was born,

48:28.133 --> 48:31.033
and I didn't have no brother
to lean on like you did.

48:32.767 --> 48:37.400
I been alone
my whole fuckin' life,

48:37.467 --> 48:40.033
and soon...

48:40.100 --> 48:41.400
you will be, too.

48:48.400 --> 48:49.967
- I'll never tell
anyone the truth

48:50.033 --> 48:51.967
about what happened
with Carolyn.

48:52.033 --> 48:55.133
That's between you and me.

48:55.200 --> 48:56.934
But, Dad...

48:58.967 --> 49:02.367
You better pray
to Jesus Christ almighty himself

49:02.433 --> 49:04.834
that I never get out
of this place,

49:04.900 --> 49:08.400
because when I do...

49:08.467 --> 49:11.100
I will kill you.

49:15.500 --> 49:17.767
- And...

49:17.834 --> 49:21.300
I brought you some company.

49:21.367 --> 49:24.166
- Jericho.
- Yeah.

49:24.233 --> 49:26.767
- Hiya, buddy.

49:26.834 --> 49:30.166
Did you miss me?
Well, I missed you.

49:32.700 --> 49:35.000
- Hey, sister.
Look, I want you to know

49:35.066 --> 49:37.967
that I've decided to become
totally selfish, okay?

49:38.033 --> 49:39.734
I'm not gonna lose Cyril
from my life.

49:39.800 --> 49:41.467
I'm gonna help save him.

49:41.533 --> 49:43.133
And whatever
you need me to do,

49:43.200 --> 49:45.367
I'm there 100%.

49:45.433 --> 49:48.000
- I am so glad to hear that.

49:56.400 --> 49:59.000
- Hey, little brother...

50:07.800 --> 50:09.800
Who loves you?

50:09.867 --> 50:11.633
- You do.

50:11.700 --> 50:14.133
- Fuckin' "A".

50:18.800 --> 50:20.600
- Drugs can cause impotence.

50:20.667 --> 50:23.367
Marijuana,
heroin, steroids.

50:23.433 --> 50:26.500
So does alcohol and tobacco.

50:26.567 --> 50:29.500
72% of men who smoke
20 or more packs a year

50:29.567 --> 50:32.100
suffer from
penile artery clot.

50:33.934 --> 50:35.300
Anybody got an ashtray?

50:35.367 --> 50:37.400
- Look, just because I'm sending
you back to Emerald City

50:37.467 --> 50:38.934
doesn't mean
you're completely well

50:39.000 --> 50:41.967
or that you can stop
taking care of yourself again.

50:42.033 --> 50:44.567
- Uh-huh.
- Don't "uh-huh" me, Augustus,

50:44.633 --> 50:47.133
or I'll come and clean
your catheter myself.

50:47.200 --> 50:49.400
- You think it's funny.

50:49.467 --> 50:52.266
- You know, when I heard that
you was healthy again, man,

50:52.333 --> 50:56.066
and that you was coming back,
I kicked myself with joy.

50:56.133 --> 50:58.834
Hey, let me give you a hand.
- I don't need no help, man.

50:58.900 --> 51:01.100
- Man, you know I always
liked you, Augustus.

51:01.166 --> 51:02.500
Man, I always respected you.

51:02.567 --> 51:06.333
- Cut the shit, man.
What you want? What?

51:06.400 --> 51:08.533
- You know Burr
got all lathered up

51:08.600 --> 51:10.533
when you went down,
all right?

51:10.600 --> 51:12.700
Blamed me for
getting you smack.

51:12.767 --> 51:14.266
- You did.
You gave me the tits.

51:14.333 --> 51:15.934
- Yeah, I know.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.100
Burr ain't got to
know that, though.

51:18.166 --> 51:19.633
See, he thinks Guerra
gave you the shit,

51:19.700 --> 51:21.567
so our little peace treaty
with the spics,

51:21.633 --> 51:23.633
it kind of fell apart.

51:23.700 --> 51:26.600
You know, Burr and Morales
got into a little fandango.

51:26.667 --> 51:28.133
Now they both in the Hole.

51:28.200 --> 51:30.200
- And if Burr finds out you
was the one that gave it to me,

51:30.266 --> 51:32.800
he's gonna skin your fat hide.

51:32.867 --> 51:36.133
Don't worry, son,
I ain't gonna rat you out.

51:36.200 --> 51:37.533
I wanted those drugs.

51:37.600 --> 51:38.967
Don't matter
who gave it to me.

51:39.033 --> 51:40.834
I'm gonna tell Burr that.

51:40.900 --> 51:43.433
- A'ight.
Thanks, man.

51:43.500 --> 51:46.900
You know, if I was a girl,
you'd get tongue.

51:46.967 --> 51:49.133
- If you was a girl, son,
you'd be butt-ass ugly.

51:49.200 --> 51:52.133
-  Why you gotta
be all like that, man?

52:12.400 --> 52:14.834
- So I was sitting in my office
watching the two of you

52:14.900 --> 52:16.333
when the fight broke out.

52:16.400 --> 52:19.433
Now, I'm not naive enough
to think you're gonna tell me

52:19.500 --> 52:21.734
what the argument was about.
And you're not naive enough

52:21.800 --> 52:23.367
to think
that I'm gonna let it go.

52:23.433 --> 52:27.166
So in order for me to not send
both of your asses to Gen Pop,

52:27.233 --> 52:29.400
we're gonna agree, once again,

52:29.467 --> 52:31.000
no violence between you.

52:31.066 --> 52:32.233
- I agree.

52:32.300 --> 52:34.467
- Redding?
- Sure.

52:34.533 --> 52:36.767
- That was a little less
than enthusiastic, but okay.

52:36.834 --> 52:38.500
You can go.

52:42.133 --> 52:45.233
So it was Morales that gave
Augustus the drugs, right?

52:45.300 --> 52:48.166
Morales or one
of his stooges, am I right?

52:48.233 --> 52:50.400
- Gospel truth, I don't know.

52:50.467 --> 52:53.767
I thought it was the spics,
but maybe I was wrong.

52:53.834 --> 52:54.934
- Then who?

52:55.000 --> 52:57.500
- Well, like I said before,

52:57.567 --> 53:00.667
Augustus will give it
to me straight.

53:00.734 --> 53:03.600
You should've let me talk to him
in the first place.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.667
- Isn't that touching?

53:16.734 --> 53:18.533
- Look, I know I didn't
do right by you guys,

53:18.600 --> 53:20.700
siding with that nigger,

53:20.767 --> 53:24.834
muscling you
out of the tit trade.

53:24.900 --> 53:25.967
I'm sorry, okay?

53:26.033 --> 53:27.400
- Sorry?

53:27.467 --> 53:29.433
You think sorry's
gonna be enough?

53:29.500 --> 53:31.767
- Mario, please.

53:31.834 --> 53:36.333
I think you'll find that
we Sicilians are misunderstood,

53:36.400 --> 53:38.033
that at heart...

53:38.100 --> 53:39.734
we can be
very forgiving people.

53:39.800 --> 53:42.233
- Oh, yeah?

53:42.300 --> 53:43.667
And what's that
forgiveness gonna cost?

53:43.734 --> 53:46.834
- Redding's 50%, 10 of yours.

53:46.900 --> 53:49.500
- That's bullshit.
- Chico.

53:52.900 --> 53:54.800
Okay.

53:54.867 --> 53:57.166
One condition, though.

53:58.567 --> 54:00.100
You kill Redding.

54:01.834 --> 54:02.767
- My pleasure.

54:07.667 --> 54:10.834
- I got angry when I heard
you was using that shit again.

54:12.967 --> 54:15.900
I wanted to lash out
in every kind of direction.

54:20.100 --> 54:22.133
And then I realized
that I was really angry

54:22.200 --> 54:23.767
at myself...

54:23.834 --> 54:26.000
For being so blind
that I didn't see that

54:26.066 --> 54:28.233
you had been back
on that shit again,

54:28.300 --> 54:31.467
for getting you strung out
on it in the first place.

54:31.533 --> 54:34.900
- Burr.
- I sit down there at the table,

54:34.967 --> 54:36.533
sitting in your daddy's chair,

54:36.600 --> 54:39.066
eating your mama's food.

54:41.166 --> 54:42.633
And all along
Eugenia never knew

54:42.700 --> 54:45.400
that I was
feeding you that shit.

54:46.834 --> 54:49.100
That I had you
slinging for me.

54:49.166 --> 54:51.133
Why I do that?

54:51.200 --> 54:53.633
W-why I tell a lie?

54:53.700 --> 54:55.834
Why'd I hurt
that sweet girl?

54:55.900 --> 54:58.333
- Listen, it's like
you said, Burr,

54:58.400 --> 55:00.467
life happens the way
life happens.

55:00.533 --> 55:02.533
- No, man, that's a copout.

55:02.600 --> 55:05.333
We make life happen.

55:05.400 --> 55:07.100
I got you strung out
on that shit

55:07.166 --> 55:09.867
'cause I wanted you
dependent on me,

55:09.934 --> 55:12.800
'cause I was always afraid
you was gonna leave me.

55:16.500 --> 55:19.867
And yet, I almost lost you
altogether forever.

55:21.600 --> 55:24.367
- Burr...

55:24.433 --> 55:27.633
You never need no drugs
to keep me close to you, man.

55:29.967 --> 55:32.033
I always loved you...

55:36.433 --> 55:37.934
Always.

55:42.567 --> 55:45.433
- Look at me,

55:45.500 --> 55:47.734
acting like
a weepy old woman now.

56:06.166 --> 56:09.033
- Burr, no!
- No!

56:37.734 --> 56:40.600
- Get him a doctor,
for Chrissake!

56:40.667 --> 56:42.633
Get him a doctor!
- Let him go!

56:44.834 --> 56:46.734
- Jesus Christ.

56:51.800 --> 56:54.400
- I--I--

56:54.467 --> 56:57.467
I can feel my legs.
