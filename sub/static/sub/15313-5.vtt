00:08.667 --> 00:10.931
Out of the way. Get out of my way!

00:18.710 --> 00:21.406
Son, you're too late. Your uncle's dead.

00:22.114 --> 00:24.105
They're all dead!

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073
Advertise your product or brand here

00:39.731 --> 00:42.597
Here, Father, Gisborne's coming.

00:43.735 --> 00:46.726
Tell him. Go on, tell him!

00:50.375 --> 00:53.776
Father, tell him his mine's a death trap.
You're not working down there no more.

00:56.848 --> 00:58.975
- We'll not go down there again.
- You'll do as I say.

00:59.051 --> 01:00.018
My brother' s dead.

01:00.085 --> 01:02.416
And your behavior suggests
that you'd care to join him.

01:02.486 --> 01:04.078
We're on strike.

01:04.156 --> 01:07.523
Till it's shored up properly you'll not get
a miner down that death pit of yours.

01:07.591 --> 01:09.389
You'd rather die here?

01:09.461 --> 01:10.791
Yes.

01:11.530 --> 01:15.330
I'd rather my soul roamed free up here
than get trapped down there again.

01:24.643 --> 01:26.406
Stay!

01:29.448 --> 01:32.178
They claim they would rather die
than go back down.

01:32.250 --> 01:34.241
You're giving them choices.

01:53.805 --> 01:56.137
Very good, Gisborne.

01:57.843 --> 01:59.208
Well!

02:00.112 --> 02:01.477
Enjoy the strike.

02:01.546 --> 02:04.674
It'll make you feel... much better.

02:05.450 --> 02:07.884
Goodbye.

02:10.455 --> 02:12.320
- They're all sacked!
- Really!

02:12.390 --> 02:14.915
- Although we need the mine working...
- Really!

02:17.596 --> 02:19.655
Forward planning, Gisborne.

02:20.732 --> 02:22.097
It's all under control.

02:22.167 --> 02:25.603
There will be fresh workers arriving
who will do as they're told!

02:26.972 --> 02:29.839
By tomorrow morning, this mine...

02:29.908 --> 02:31.876
will be working.

02:34.079 --> 02:36.274
Unlike you lot.

02:36.348 --> 02:39.511
Bury this man's body with the others.
His family will pay for the grave.

02:39.584 --> 02:44.647
If they will not work,
they will not be fed until I see fit.

02:44.723 --> 02:46.884
Anyone giving them assistance will hang.

02:47.359 --> 02:49.850
You are all sacked. Go home.

03:47.385 --> 03:49.410
I knew you'd be like this.

03:49.487 --> 03:52.684
If you're so bothered about
the archery competition...

03:52.757 --> 03:55.226
I'm not!

03:55.293 --> 03:56.658
If you're so bothered...

03:58.663 --> 04:00.858
we could always have a little competition here.

04:00.932 --> 04:05.835
I don't want to be in the archery competition.
Even if there is a silver arrow for the winner.

04:08.240 --> 04:09.571
Just as well.

04:10.442 --> 04:13.935
Because by the time we've done a little hunting
and had ourselves a decent feast,

04:14.013 --> 04:17.310
there 'll be no time to go to Nottingham
and get ourselves hanged.

04:21.486 --> 04:24.785
Father, I will avenge thee. Gisborne will pay.

04:30.863 --> 04:32.386
Food parcels?

04:32.464 --> 04:35.456
You can't give to us. Gisborne's forbidden it.

04:35.533 --> 04:37.524
He has spies everywhere.

04:44.343 --> 04:48.779
Nothing like a tragedy to bring out
the do-gooders. Where is your leader?

04:49.649 --> 04:51.708
Where is Robin Hood?

04:53.251 --> 04:55.515
Or are you alone?

04:55.587 --> 04:58.613
Does Robin Hood think himself too important
to do his own mischief now?

04:59.925 --> 05:01.289
Hm?

05:01.760 --> 05:06.323
A man of few words? No matter, I'm sure I will
hear your voice when you plead for your life.

05:08.501 --> 05:09.593
Not even an "Ouch".

05:09.669 --> 05:12.102
"Ouch" costs nothing.
Surely you could utter an "ouch".

05:29.921 --> 05:31.549
The trap worked. We caught one.

05:31.624 --> 05:33.683
A cart. Let's go. Let's go!

05:36.696 --> 05:38.060
Heap! Rubbish heap!

05:38.129 --> 05:39.688
And you! Rubbish heap.

05:49.141 --> 05:52.577
Here. It's all I have of value. Take it!

05:59.652 --> 06:02.449
Pretty! Not very appetizing.

06:05.390 --> 06:07.483
Livestock?

06:07.559 --> 06:09.720
Take one. And let me on my way.

06:11.163 --> 06:14.462
They'll work for you.
They understand simple commands.

06:15.301 --> 06:17.928
New men for the Sheriff's mine.

06:19.305 --> 06:20.795
Slaves?

06:26.578 --> 06:29.013
- Sir Guy.
- She is home?

06:29.581 --> 06:32.016
Yes. Come through.

06:37.523 --> 06:39.423
Father?

06:39.492 --> 06:41.083
Are you hurt?

06:41.159 --> 06:43.059
I caught it on a splinter on the door.

06:43.128 --> 06:45.358
- Let me see.
- No, no, no, it's nothing.

06:46.499 --> 06:47.864
What does Gisborne want?

06:47.933 --> 06:50.959
I don't know. Come on. Come down.

07:01.247 --> 07:03.442
- Marian.
- To what do we owe the honor, Sir Guy?

07:05.351 --> 07:07.341
Today I am attending...

07:08.286 --> 07:12.781
I'm sure you would expect,
as you yourself may also have the intention...

07:13.926 --> 07:18.522
But I thought, even so, that would not
necessarily make my question redundant.

07:18.596 --> 07:20.087
Attending...?

07:21.066 --> 07:23.626
- The Sheriff's fair.
- Oh.

07:26.070 --> 07:28.596
So what's your answer?

07:28.674 --> 07:31.609
Forgive me, Sir Guy.
I do not yet understand the question.

07:32.478 --> 07:35.845
I am inviting you to the fair
as my personal guest.

07:36.481 --> 07:39.883
I fear I wouldn't be good company. I'm tired.

07:43.289 --> 07:44.812
You're ashamed of your hair.

07:46.292 --> 07:49.489
But I thought of that. I have a gift for you.
It's a shawl...

07:49.562 --> 07:51.085
You can...

07:51.664 --> 07:53.859
I didn't sleep well. That is all.

07:53.933 --> 07:55.764
You're declining my invitation?

07:55.835 --> 07:58.599
Marian is delicate. She has wounded...

07:58.671 --> 08:00.366
- Wounded?
- Pride.

08:02.640 --> 08:05.633
Wounded pride. My hair. As you guessed.

08:06.645 --> 08:07.737
Thank you.

08:09.248 --> 08:11.443
So you will come?

08:17.056 --> 08:20.219
Good! It should be an interesting day.

08:20.860 --> 08:23.589
The Sheriff is convinced
that he'll lure Robin Hood.

08:23.661 --> 08:25.630
He's put up a silver arrow as a prize.

08:25.697 --> 08:27.563
- Silver?
- Yeah, but it won't work.

08:27.666 --> 08:30.930
Hood is delegating his crimes to lackeys now.
I confronted one this morning.

08:31.003 --> 08:33.631
- An outlaw?
- Or a disguised villager.

08:33.706 --> 08:35.037
I'll find him.

08:35.106 --> 08:37.166
He is marked, I inflicted a wound to his arm.

08:38.577 --> 08:41.568
I was being kind. I should have killed him.

08:43.282 --> 08:45.273
Well, I'll send a coach for you then.

08:47.419 --> 08:49.580
Good day.

08:50.322 --> 08:51.653
My Lady.

08:55.294 --> 08:57.194
Sir Guy.

09:05.404 --> 09:07.929
I think you owe me an explanation, young lady.

09:08.007 --> 09:09.406
It was you, wasn't it?

09:09.475 --> 09:13.002
There are people starving.
People whose menfolk have died at the mine.

09:13.078 --> 09:16.673
- Should we do nothing?
- What? You think you're Robin Hood now?

09:17.516 --> 09:18.847
Is that it?

09:18.918 --> 09:21.785
- You're in competition with Robin?
- This is no competition.

09:21.854 --> 09:23.913
I've been helping people far longer than him.

09:23.989 --> 09:25.718
- How much longer?
- Three years.

09:26.258 --> 09:28.089
I do not know you at all, do I?

09:32.731 --> 09:34.756
I never thought I'd see this again.

09:35.868 --> 09:37.199
Outrageous.

09:37.269 --> 09:38.702
Disgrace.

09:39.672 --> 09:41.037
Trading people.

09:41.106 --> 09:43.267
Would you like some more wine?

09:53.519 --> 09:56.386
I'm not being funny but...
you brought him here for a picnic?

09:56.455 --> 09:59.322
We need him. He's our way into the mine.

09:59.391 --> 10:02.258
- There is no way into the mine.
- We're going to stop this.

10:02.328 --> 10:04.387
This is a gift.

10:04.463 --> 10:07.125
We're going to close the mine once and for all.

10:08.100 --> 10:11.558
We will stop this human trafficking.

10:14.574 --> 10:16.404
I thought you were gonna slit me throat.

10:16.475 --> 10:18.409
Or worse.

10:18.477 --> 10:20.570
We don't do throat-slitting.

10:20.646 --> 10:22.841
It's too messy.

10:22.916 --> 10:25.281
Now you've eaten I'd like to feed
your prisoners.

10:25.351 --> 10:27.478
Not meat. It makes them spirited, you see.

10:27.553 --> 10:29.646
Oh, and keep your distance.

10:30.656 --> 10:33.216
Don't let them breathe near you.

10:33.292 --> 10:34.453
Disease!

10:34.527 --> 10:36.994
Some of our soldiers dropped dead
after getting too close.

10:37.062 --> 10:38.393
Dropped dead?

10:38.464 --> 10:42.195
Aye, one minute stood there
strong as you, the next...

10:43.035 --> 10:45.469
brains dripping from their nostrils.

10:54.179 --> 10:57.581
Water. That'll do 'em.

10:57.650 --> 10:59.914
They had some scraps earlier.

10:59.985 --> 11:03.649
There used to be a decent living
to be made from selling folk.

11:03.723 --> 11:07.089
Then the Pope goes and bans trading Christians.

11:07.159 --> 11:10.129
Thank heavens King Richard likes
his wars abroad.

11:12.198 --> 11:13.858
Will?

11:13.932 --> 11:16.367
- They need water.
- Yeah, I'm on it.

11:16.436 --> 11:18.529
Look, you seriously don't believe...

11:18.637 --> 11:20.435
No!

11:20.507 --> 11:23.533
Well, give them water.
Can't you see they're suffering enough?

11:23.610 --> 11:25.635
I notice you're not doing it.

11:26.445 --> 11:28.971
Listen, there is no disease.

11:29.048 --> 11:31.414
It's ignorance and superstition and...

11:34.254 --> 11:35.914
You are a genius!

11:35.988 --> 11:37.149
John!

11:38.957 --> 11:40.720
- Have a drink with our friend.
- What?

11:40.793 --> 11:44.457
There 's something I need to find
in the forest. I need some time.

11:44.531 --> 11:47.659
If he loses consciousness, then so be it.

11:55.274 --> 11:57.140
No consciousness.

12:13.893 --> 12:17.760
Could have been worse. If you'd not ordered
the slaves, we'd have had to close the mine.

12:17.830 --> 12:19.230
"Slaves?"

12:19.299 --> 12:21.199
I prefer "out-workers."

12:21.301 --> 12:24.202
This... mourning, it is tiresome. Isn't it?

12:24.304 --> 12:26.032
Outlaw it.

12:26.105 --> 12:30.064
At least nobody will grieve
for our new workers when they turn up.

12:35.614 --> 12:36.843
Women!

12:36.916 --> 12:38.975
How do they manage to hit that particular pitch

12:39.052 --> 12:42.044
that makes you want to pierce
your own eardrums with a stick?

12:42.122 --> 12:44.249
Never marry, Gisborne. Hm?

12:44.324 --> 12:45.847
Women!

12:45.924 --> 12:47.449
Keep them at a distance.

12:47.527 --> 12:49.688
Think... Think of a leper.

13:06.346 --> 13:08.745
Soon after Robin went to war,
you remember I was ill?

13:08.814 --> 13:10.680
Sarah the cook used to look after me.

13:10.749 --> 13:13.651
She was always so jolly
and one day she didn't come.

13:13.720 --> 13:16.553
The physician who visited me told me
her daughter was seriously ill

13:16.623 --> 13:18.146
and had been for a long time.

13:18.892 --> 13:22.224
So when you were asleep, I visited Sarah
and I gave her daughter my medicine.

13:22.294 --> 13:27.755
- Very noble, but if you are caught now...
- Sarah was shocked that I cared about her.

13:27.833 --> 13:31.030
And that's when I decided I could go to war too.

13:31.104 --> 13:32.968
I could go to war against poverty.

13:33.038 --> 13:36.201
Sir Edward, my Lady?
Sir Guy is waiting.

13:40.145 --> 13:42.080
We need to get rid of the guards at the mine.

13:42.147 --> 13:44.513
One of you has to travel in the cage
as a prisoner.

13:45.584 --> 13:48.247
We need a man on the inside
to start the rumor of Turk Flu.

13:48.321 --> 13:50.949
- A volunteer!
- Yes, Much. Thank you.

13:51.024 --> 13:52.423
Allan.

13:54.860 --> 13:57.988
- And what, I eat this do I?
- No! Just chew.

13:59.064 --> 14:00.726
There is nothing to fear.

14:00.800 --> 14:04.566
Once the guards believe that the prisoners
have a disease they'll run for their lives!

14:04.637 --> 14:09.768
Surely only the stupid amongst them
is going to fall for it. I mean... Turk Flu?

14:09.843 --> 14:11.970
People fear what they don't understand.

14:12.045 --> 14:13.602
I wasn't scared.

14:13.679 --> 14:16.944
No!

14:17.015 --> 14:19.814
Will, you proved my point.

14:19.885 --> 14:25.825
If even you had doubts, the Sheriff's men...
they'll be a pushover.

14:25.892 --> 14:28.986
It'll never work!
I have another suggestion.

14:29.062 --> 14:32.964
Instead of relying on the Sheriff's men
being as stupid as... Why...

14:33.032 --> 14:35.262
- Hey! Let go!
- It's mine.

14:35.335 --> 14:36.631
Stolen!

14:39.405 --> 14:40.770
You speak English!

14:58.690 --> 15:03.992
You're not going to like this, Robin,
but I think that's Marian in Gisborne's coach.

15:04.062 --> 15:06.657
She must be going to Nottingham.
The Sheriff's fair.

15:07.634 --> 15:08.726
Why did I do that?

15:09.268 --> 15:10.861
Why did I tell him to stand up to Gisborne?

15:10.937 --> 15:13.303
I should have at least kept me mouth shut.

15:15.574 --> 15:19.477
I told him to stand up for himself
but what did I do?

15:19.545 --> 15:23.242
Gisborne and the Sheriff
walked straight by me and I did nothing.

15:26.119 --> 15:28.109
You and me, we'll get through this.

15:30.490 --> 15:33.050
Don't worry, I'm not going to do
anything stupid.

15:34.260 --> 15:36.125
Why would I do anything stupid?

15:40.133 --> 15:42.465
There 's just something I need to do.

15:43.870 --> 15:46.338
I'll see you later.

15:46.406 --> 15:48.374
I'll see you.

16:06.125 --> 16:07.285
Islama.

16:07.760 --> 16:09.125
Islama.

16:11.130 --> 16:15.123
I have a simple yet effective way
of gaining you freedom.

16:15.201 --> 16:18.568
And a lot less dangerous than riding
into a heavily guarded mine.

16:18.638 --> 16:21.198
Opening the cage.
That is simple and effective.

16:22.041 --> 16:23.406
No...

16:23.476 --> 16:25.467
This is clever.

16:25.912 --> 16:27.971
Renounce your God.

16:28.047 --> 16:29.776
Then nobody can buy or sell you.

16:30.783 --> 16:32.307
Renounce my God?

16:32.385 --> 16:35.115
And claim you believe in the Christian one.

16:35.188 --> 16:38.385
But it's all right.
Because Gods are all-knowing.

16:38.458 --> 16:41.018
So your God will know you're only pretending.

16:41.094 --> 16:46.191
Why would I pretend to be Christian?
You kill my people in the name of Christianity!

16:46.265 --> 16:48.256
Shhh...

16:48.334 --> 16:50.735
Christians cannot be traded.

16:50.803 --> 16:52.395
The Sheriff will not buy you.

16:52.472 --> 16:55.737
You can go free and we can
go home and eat.

16:57.910 --> 16:59.878
So if it's that easy...

16:59.946 --> 17:01.413
you do it.

17:01.481 --> 17:03.108
Renounce your God.

17:05.386 --> 17:07.012
Me?

17:07.086 --> 17:09.179
You do not trust that he can see
into your heart?

17:10.957 --> 17:13.756
Of course I trust. He can.

17:15.461 --> 17:18.259
I could renounce him, like that.

17:21.101 --> 17:23.090
I do not believe in God.

17:24.470 --> 17:26.199
No, I don't.

17:26.272 --> 17:28.569
There!

17:28.641 --> 17:30.233
Ah!

17:30.309 --> 17:33.244
Come on! Help me tie Brooker up.

17:39.719 --> 17:42.279
I do... obviously.

17:43.856 --> 17:45.448
Where 's the trader?

17:45.525 --> 17:49.326
Of course, by now I should be at home
with a goblet of fine red wine.

17:49.396 --> 17:51.590
Hm? Watching your archer, what's his name?

17:51.664 --> 17:55.361
- Michael the Red.
- Michael the Red!

17:55.435 --> 17:56.993
Yes!

17:57.070 --> 17:59.767
My Lord, if you would prefer
to go back to Nottingham,

17:59.840 --> 18:02.866
- I'm happy to stay here and...
- What? Leave you in charge of the mine?

18:02.943 --> 18:07.606
Sorry, remind me exactly how much iron ore
have you brought to the surface today?

18:11.117 --> 18:13.984
You! Can't you get them to do some
maneuvers or something?

18:14.053 --> 18:17.216
Nearest I'll get to any entertainment today. Ooh!

18:18.257 --> 18:21.317
Left! Left! Left!

18:21.394 --> 18:25.763
- And left! And right!
- Left! Left! Left!

18:25.832 --> 18:28.665
And turn! Left!

18:28.734 --> 18:30.793
Left! Left!

18:30.870 --> 18:33.930
Left! Left! Come on!

18:34.006 --> 18:37.339
We send Brooker in. When the Sheriff
and Gisborne leave for Nottingham,

18:37.411 --> 18:39.776
Allan does his thing, then we strike.

18:41.748 --> 18:43.214
Left! Left!

18:43.282 --> 18:45.011
Now, this is what we do.

18:45.084 --> 18:48.815
You sell your prisoners to the Sheriff
just as you planned.

18:48.889 --> 18:51.482
Allan will be right behind you,
disguised as a prisoner.

18:51.557 --> 18:55.823
If you give us away, be warned - we may
have to review our policy on throat slitting.

18:55.895 --> 18:57.726
Fire! There 's a fire!

19:02.436 --> 19:05.233
Punishment from God! It's all my fault!

19:05.304 --> 19:08.637
Oh! I'm sorry, Lord! I do believe, I do!

19:08.709 --> 19:10.733
Much, will you shut up!

19:11.644 --> 19:13.475
- How did you light that fire?
- Let us go!

19:13.546 --> 19:16.777
- We are trying to help you.
- You've stolen us to sell to another.

19:16.849 --> 19:19.444
- You're no better than him.
- Please, let me explain.

19:19.520 --> 19:23.513
Then if you do not wish to help us,
then you are free to go. You have my word.

19:26.926 --> 19:28.861
What is your name?

19:28.929 --> 19:32.888
- Djaq.
- Djaq. We will help you escape.

19:32.966 --> 19:36.731
But if you leave now, the Sheriff will still need
workers for his mine.

19:36.802 --> 19:40.466
More prisoners will arrive next month.
People like you.

19:41.475 --> 19:44.170
We are going to destroy the mine
but we need your help.

19:44.243 --> 19:45.801
How will you help us escape?

19:45.878 --> 19:48.575
The Sheriff will pay for you.
And we will give you the money.

19:48.649 --> 19:52.379
And we will guide you to the people
who will find you a safe passage to the port.

19:52.451 --> 19:55.443
You made us the enemy.
And now you play protector?

19:56.355 --> 19:57.720
And ask for our help?

20:01.295 --> 20:04.855
Let them decide! If you want to take
your chance with freedom now, then go.

20:08.468 --> 20:10.800
- What are they saying?
- He says that...

20:10.871 --> 20:13.065
if you do not let us go, he will kill you.

20:14.908 --> 20:17.172
That is not what he said.

20:17.243 --> 20:20.077
He said "nou sa lei". That means "pray".

20:20.147 --> 20:23.275
Is that what you want to do? Wash and pray?

20:23.350 --> 20:24.611
Pray? Nou sa lei?

20:28.154 --> 20:30.555
And then will you help us? Please?

20:30.624 --> 20:34.081
Left! Left! Left!

20:34.160 --> 20:36.721
Left! Left! And turn!

20:39.066 --> 20:41.363
Come on, look sharp!

20:43.469 --> 20:44.697
Robin says that we have to...

20:45.973 --> 20:47.372
You spy on me!

20:49.376 --> 20:53.335
No! Robin, he... We have to keep...

20:57.551 --> 21:01.647
Remember, if this goes wrong,
you will die!

21:06.826 --> 21:09.990
- This lateness...?
- I went round t'forest.

21:10.063 --> 21:11.587
Didn't want to risk the outlaws.

21:11.665 --> 21:13.257
Did I ask for a route?

21:13.333 --> 21:16.598
No! Next month you will be on time.
Do you understand?

21:16.670 --> 21:19.002
I will be on time next month, my Lord.

21:22.109 --> 21:23.370
Shackles!

21:36.490 --> 21:38.458
I like it, this is good.

21:42.729 --> 21:44.788
You don't expect full price for this one?

21:44.865 --> 21:47.389
- He has no muscle.
- He has spirit.

21:47.466 --> 21:49.799
Spirit? I've seen more spirit on cheese.

22:08.354 --> 22:10.481
- Who are you?
- I'm Rowan, son of Dunne.

22:10.556 --> 22:11.922
And I'm going to kill Gisborne.

22:11.992 --> 22:14.358
If you do that now, the mine will stay open.

22:14.428 --> 22:18.592
You will sabotage our plan and you will put
one of my men's life in danger.

22:18.665 --> 22:20.656
If any die within the month...

22:20.734 --> 22:22.668
I'll take it off your next bill.

22:22.736 --> 22:24.601
Pay the man, Gisborne.

22:28.075 --> 22:30.236
Good. So, to work.

22:31.377 --> 22:32.345
Iron!

22:33.180 --> 22:34.977
Iron!

22:45.192 --> 22:46.682
I can't let him get away.

22:46.760 --> 22:50.526
If the Sheriff or Gisborne dead would help
Nottingham, I'd have killed them months ago.

22:50.597 --> 22:51.757
They deserve to die.

22:51.832 --> 22:54.767
Wouldn't you rather see them lose the things
that mean everything to them?

22:54.835 --> 22:57.598
- Like what?
- The mine.

22:57.671 --> 22:59.332
Iron ore is their strength.

22:59.406 --> 23:01.340
Their power.

23:03.610 --> 23:05.635
In!

23:07.147 --> 23:09.081
Give me a separate job, please.

23:09.148 --> 23:11.379
I'll work twice as hard.

23:11.451 --> 23:14.852
You're not a prisoner of war, you're English.

23:14.921 --> 23:16.912
I'm a deserter.

23:16.990 --> 23:19.220
There were loads of us with...

23:19.292 --> 23:21.055
It's the Turk Flu.

23:21.128 --> 23:23.358
It's wiped out everyone except me.

23:23.430 --> 23:24.522
The Turk Flu?

23:24.598 --> 23:26.657
We English have no resistance.

23:26.733 --> 23:29.327
Foaming. Writhing.

23:29.403 --> 23:31.428
Rotting.

23:33.273 --> 23:35.264
One man caught it from as close
as I am from you.

23:35.342 --> 23:38.402
Within minutes, this black liquid
oozed from his nose.

23:41.148 --> 23:43.275
Just get to work.

24:03.003 --> 24:06.769
I don't know which is worse,
wailing widows or prancing peasants.

24:06.840 --> 24:09.331
Can you see the man who you fought with?

24:09.409 --> 24:13.539
Short and injured. Although the injury
would be beneath his left sleeve.

24:13.613 --> 24:16.275
Perhaps I should order them all
to remove their sleeves?

24:16.349 --> 24:19.217
Perhaps you should remember who it is
that gives the orders.

24:21.488 --> 24:23.547
- Marian.
- My Lord.

24:24.257 --> 24:26.248
Lepers, Gisborne. Lepers.

24:34.334 --> 24:38.169
Lord save me! Save me!

24:38.238 --> 24:42.004
- Kill him, quick!
- No! His blood will poison the air.

24:42.075 --> 24:45.533
If you're gonna kill someone, kill me, please.
I can feel it starting in me!

24:45.612 --> 24:47.547
Don't let me suffer.

24:47.614 --> 24:48.842
What's that?

24:50.685 --> 24:53.813
- What's wrong with him? Quick!
- Let's get out of here!

24:53.888 --> 24:55.252
Oh!

25:06.132 --> 25:08.566
- Hey!
- John! Keep him conscious.

25:09.202 --> 25:10.897
Robin!

25:11.371 --> 25:12.838
Robin!

25:13.907 --> 25:15.636
What is this stuff? Tastes weird.

25:17.444 --> 25:19.537
You'll be fine as long as you don't...

25:19.646 --> 25:22.013
swallow it. I said, don't swallow it!

25:22.083 --> 25:24.244
You'll be fine. Lay fires!

25:24.317 --> 25:26.115
Around those beams and inside!

25:26.187 --> 25:28.620
Let me light them.
I'll burn the place to t'ground.

25:28.688 --> 25:30.679
- I don't think so. We'll do that.
- No!

25:30.757 --> 25:34.352
Let Rowan. For his father.

25:36.463 --> 25:39.694
Thanks to the rogue element amongst you,

25:40.667 --> 25:45.105
I have been forced
to introduce new security measures.

25:46.207 --> 25:51.270
The guilty object to security
because the guilty have something to hide.

25:53.813 --> 25:55.611
So.

25:55.683 --> 25:58.584
I expect your full co-operation.

26:01.689 --> 26:05.715
No man shall wear a sleeve on his left arm.

26:18.739 --> 26:20.365
Oh, and, er...

26:20.440 --> 26:22.408
do have a lovely fair. Thank you.

26:27.314 --> 26:28.645
That one... Ooh, no.

26:33.087 --> 26:34.917
Can I not keep the money?

26:34.988 --> 26:37.889
You are a despicable, heartless,
soulless slave-trader,

26:37.958 --> 26:39.517
lucky to escape with your life.

26:39.594 --> 26:41.425
- That's a no.
- Now go.

26:42.496 --> 26:43.485
Go?

26:48.069 --> 26:50.094
I'll see that you suffer!

26:54.574 --> 26:55.973
You're letting him free?

26:56.043 --> 27:01.207
He'll run straight to the Sheriff of Nottingham
and he and Gisborne will get on their horses...

27:02.350 --> 27:03.681
Oh, I get it.

27:03.751 --> 27:06.845
- Get what?
- They come here, you go to your fair.

27:06.921 --> 27:10.084
Much as it saddens me to drag
Gisborne away from his wooing.

27:10.156 --> 27:13.251
- Gisborne's wooing?
- Yes. Marian!

27:13.326 --> 27:15.487
Remember the road I told you of?

27:17.198 --> 27:20.326
- When you get to the Abbey...
- Mention your name.

27:22.068 --> 27:24.059
Salaam alaikum, Djaq.

27:26.474 --> 27:28.601
Alaikum Salaam.

27:28.676 --> 27:32.043
God speed, Robin.

27:32.113 --> 27:33.080
Much!

27:33.147 --> 27:35.580
What's going on with the pilot fire?

27:35.649 --> 27:37.412
I'll do it.

27:53.266 --> 27:54.859
Primitive!

27:55.936 --> 27:58.905
Well, I think we deserve
an outing to Nottingham

27:58.973 --> 28:00.941
for such a smooth and successful operation.

28:01.008 --> 28:04.307
In fact, apart from Allan's ingestion
of a certain plant root...

28:04.378 --> 28:05.844
Which will do what to me exactly?

28:07.847 --> 28:09.645
...I'd say today has gone without a...

28:13.988 --> 28:16.115
- John!
- John!

28:16.189 --> 28:19.887
Step forward Ford, son of Ford.

28:19.960 --> 28:21.483
Son of Ford!

28:24.065 --> 28:27.057
No sign of Robin Hood.

28:27.134 --> 28:28.123
He's a coward.

28:30.538 --> 28:33.666
- Close...
- Your Michael the Red better be a winner.

28:34.742 --> 28:37.802
I don't want to have to give
this silver arrow away.

28:39.013 --> 28:42.278
But surely if my man wins then...
the silver arrow will be mine.

28:42.348 --> 28:45.079
If Robin Hood turns up and wins,

28:45.152 --> 28:48.588
I will hang him and keep the arrow.

28:48.655 --> 28:52.148
If he doesn't, and your man wins,

28:52.226 --> 28:53.659
he will return it.

28:55.161 --> 28:59.325
- I see...
- Or I will hold you responsible.

29:02.737 --> 29:04.967
John!

29:05.072 --> 29:06.039
John!

29:06.874 --> 29:07.841
John!

29:09.477 --> 29:13.140
When are we gonna burn the mine?
The Sheriff will be coming.

29:13.214 --> 29:15.148
We can't until we've rescued John.

29:15.216 --> 29:18.344
- I'm going down there.
- What, to get stuck down there with him?

29:18.419 --> 29:21.251
To help him!
We broke up the ladders for firewood.

29:21.321 --> 29:23.847
- If we can't pull him out...
- He could be bleeding to death.

29:23.924 --> 29:27.155
- Maybe he just can't breathe.
- So he suffocates, will that suit you better?

29:27.228 --> 29:28.889
I'll go down there.

29:28.963 --> 29:31.796
- You need someone smaller.
- You couldn't lift him.

29:31.866 --> 29:33.231
I'll help him lift himself.

29:33.300 --> 29:36.167
- He could be bleeding.
- Or suffocating, I heard.

29:36.237 --> 29:39.034
- My father was a physician.
- Oh, great!

29:39.106 --> 29:42.633
My father was a blacksmith.
It doesn't mean I can make a horseshoe.

29:42.710 --> 29:44.405
No Djaq, wait. Please!

29:44.478 --> 29:46.036
If there is something you can do.

29:46.113 --> 29:47.978
I can stop the blood. Bring him round.

29:48.048 --> 29:51.279
- Then do it.
- I need silver. Look over there.

29:52.086 --> 29:53.986
There must be some along with the iron ore.

29:54.054 --> 29:56.284
Silver? He wants paying now?

29:56.357 --> 29:58.757
Traces of silver.

29:58.826 --> 30:00.555
Not coins.

30:02.730 --> 30:05.460
- And water, quickly.
- Do as he says.

30:07.001 --> 30:11.631
Sorry, Lord, I will fast for a day and a night,
just please let us get him out.

30:13.007 --> 30:15.441
Silver and this - acid.

30:15.509 --> 30:18.910
Together make a liquid, stop the bleeding.

30:18.979 --> 30:20.947
You don't need to understand.

30:22.149 --> 30:23.844
Fine.

30:23.918 --> 30:25.613
Save Gisborne's mine.

30:25.686 --> 30:27.950
Save his wealth.

30:28.022 --> 30:30.149
I'm going to go and tear his heart.

30:30.224 --> 30:32.215
Let's see him woo a dead woman.

30:36.130 --> 30:39.190
Not quite the bullseye.

30:39.266 --> 30:43.225
They say the peel of an apple can predict
who a woman will marry.

30:43.304 --> 30:44.430
How?

30:44.505 --> 30:47.804
The curl of the peel represents
the first letter of his name.

30:49.144 --> 30:50.701
Oh!

30:50.778 --> 30:52.939
Our next archer is Michael the Red.

30:53.013 --> 30:54.480
Ah. This will impress you.

30:57.885 --> 30:59.648
I cut myself.

30:59.720 --> 31:02.348
- Your arm?
- No, my hand.

31:03.691 --> 31:04.953
Look.

31:05.025 --> 31:07.016
I must have got some on my sleeve.

31:07.094 --> 31:10.495
... Michael the Red!

31:28.182 --> 31:29.479
There 's...

31:29.550 --> 31:31.677
I think he wants us to follow him.

31:33.121 --> 31:34.382
The mine's...!

31:34.455 --> 31:36.184
The mine...

31:36.258 --> 31:37.622
R- Ro...

31:37.691 --> 31:40.159
- Robin Hood.
- Robin Hood, mm...

31:40.227 --> 31:41.751
Fire!

31:41.829 --> 31:43.387
Robin Hood, mine, fire.

31:43.464 --> 31:45.091
Soldiers! Soldiers!

31:56.710 --> 31:58.644
It's witchcraft.

31:58.712 --> 32:00.976
Because we don't know what it is?

32:01.048 --> 32:03.949
We made him trust us,
so we have to trust him.

32:04.051 --> 32:05.576
Just drop the second line down.

32:09.724 --> 32:11.919
Lower me down.

32:12.861 --> 32:16.591
We should have gone after Brooker.
He'll have told the Sheriff by now.

32:16.664 --> 32:18.098
Much!

32:23.804 --> 32:25.897
Three days and three nights.

32:25.973 --> 32:27.964
Not a morsel will cross my lips.

32:28.042 --> 32:29.635
Just get us out of here.

32:47.995 --> 32:50.759
Come on, big man, wake up...

32:51.733 --> 32:54.565
Please! Wake up!

32:56.170 --> 32:59.731
There you go. Here, smell this. It will help you...

33:04.878 --> 33:07.245
Put this on. Around your foot.

33:15.356 --> 33:16.323
Pull!

33:21.796 --> 33:23.695
Master, the Sheriff. What do we do?

33:25.866 --> 33:27.129
Come on, John!

33:27.235 --> 33:28.496
- Robin!
- Come on, John!

33:29.104 --> 33:31.402
- They're getting closer.
- Come on, John!

33:33.408 --> 33:37.434
Come on, almost there! Pull, John, pull!

34:01.068 --> 34:05.028
Get John into cover. I'll take care of this.

34:11.512 --> 34:13.481
Into the trees. Go! Run!

34:26.493 --> 34:28.860
Where are your guards,
on their refreshment break?

34:42.577 --> 34:45.170
Get it out! Get the fire out!

34:57.724 --> 34:59.715
Does anyone smell burning?

35:00.528 --> 35:04.224
Get the fire out!
Forget the outlaws! Save the mine!

35:06.066 --> 35:08.433
Never forget the outlaws!

35:13.675 --> 35:15.505
- Where are the others?
- Gone.

35:15.576 --> 35:18.068
Hey, Rowan will be sorry he missed the blaze.

35:18.146 --> 35:19.511
Him?

35:19.580 --> 35:21.242
He's gone to take revenge on his enemy.

35:21.316 --> 35:23.250
Why? Gisborne's here.

35:23.318 --> 35:24.751
His woman!

35:24.818 --> 35:26.877
To tear his heart out by killing his woman.

35:26.954 --> 35:28.718
Gisborne hasn't got a...

35:29.657 --> 35:31.123
Marian!

35:31.191 --> 35:34.855
Nothing tempts pennies from the poor
like their hope of silver.

35:34.929 --> 35:37.261
- Name.
- Rowan, son of Dunne.

35:38.066 --> 35:39.760
Rowan, son of Dunne.

35:41.536 --> 35:43.765
You'd not sooner keep your penny, son?

35:43.837 --> 35:45.362
No, thanks.

35:45.440 --> 35:47.806
A penny well spent.

35:50.311 --> 35:52.073
The next contestant will be...

36:07.061 --> 36:08.789
This place is done for.

36:08.862 --> 36:12.093
You should have expected him.
It was obvious this was a target.

36:12.166 --> 36:16.001
With respect, my Lord, he was supposed to be
in Nottingham trying to win the silver arrow.

36:43.731 --> 36:45.756
Over there.

36:51.673 --> 36:53.902
He's following Marian, quick!

37:02.917 --> 37:04.680
My Lady!

37:04.752 --> 37:06.151
It'll be quick.

37:06.221 --> 37:08.155
I'm a good shot.

37:15.129 --> 37:17.188
Your father died at the mine, didn't he?

37:17.265 --> 37:18.596
How do you know?

37:19.467 --> 37:21.458
It's difficult to explain.

37:22.670 --> 37:25.400
But I know he must have loved you very much.

37:25.473 --> 37:28.067
Everybody knew how dangerous it was
to go down that mine.

37:28.142 --> 37:32.010
- I told him not to.
- He wanted to feed you. And your family.

37:32.080 --> 37:35.948
- Your lover knew it wasn't safe!
- Your father must have known too.

37:36.017 --> 37:37.814
I'm going to kill you.

37:37.884 --> 37:41.218
Make him suffer. Make him understand loss.

37:41.289 --> 37:43.223
At the cost of your own life?

37:43.291 --> 37:45.555
It's what Gisborne deserves.

37:45.627 --> 37:49.256
Your mother will lose
the man of her house twice.

37:50.331 --> 37:51.696
What about her suffering?

37:52.467 --> 37:54.196
I can't do nothing.

37:54.269 --> 37:55.998
Just stand and do nothing.

37:56.070 --> 38:00.063
Well, if you want to hurt the Sheriff,
win his silver arrow.

38:00.141 --> 38:02.405
You say you are a good shot.

38:02.477 --> 38:04.001
Win it.

38:04.078 --> 38:06.546
Use the silver, melt it down into coins.

38:06.614 --> 38:08.582
You could feed your family for months.

38:09.684 --> 38:12.619
Compensate all the miners ' widows.

38:12.687 --> 38:15.986
Or would you rather shoot
an unarmed woman?

38:34.575 --> 38:35.906
Marian?

38:35.977 --> 38:39.037
Better late than never, I suppose.

38:39.113 --> 38:41.877
Make sure this one wins the silver arrow.

38:46.521 --> 38:48.512
Robin!

38:48.589 --> 38:50.318
Help me.

38:52.860 --> 38:56.762
Will then next contestant please take his mark!

38:59.167 --> 39:03.627
The next contestant is Rowan, son of Dunne.

39:17.585 --> 39:18.711
Bravo!

39:19.921 --> 39:21.617
- Robin Hood!
- Seize him!

39:52.086 --> 39:55.214
That arrow will feed the miners
for a whole winter.

39:55.289 --> 39:57.257
Come on, let's go.

40:03.898 --> 40:05.957
Him... Rowan.

40:06.033 --> 40:07.433
Hey!

40:07.503 --> 40:10.528
No food or drink for one day and night
and then he'll be fine.

40:11.840 --> 40:15.003
Oh, just as well seeing there 's
so little venison left...

40:15.076 --> 40:17.910
- Hey!
- You're fasting too, aren't you?

40:18.846 --> 40:21.338
You made a promise... to God!

40:21.416 --> 40:23.475
You don't know it was Him who got us out.

40:24.952 --> 40:26.647
We might have got out of there anyway.

40:26.721 --> 40:29.714
And if it had been Him,
there would have been a sign.

40:29.791 --> 40:31.589
And there was no sign.

40:31.660 --> 40:35.220
So I am gonna to build a fire, cook some food,

40:35.296 --> 40:37.594
and there 's nothing any of you can do about it.

40:43.272 --> 40:45.365
Champion of the Sheriff's Fair,

40:45.473 --> 40:47.566
and winner of the silver arrow,

40:47.675 --> 40:50.041
Rowan, son of Dunne.

41:08.696 --> 41:10.721
Ho! A sign!

41:14.101 --> 41:16.092
Which means I have to fast.

41:19.307 --> 41:21.298
Except God wants me to eat.

41:25.313 --> 41:27.747
Oh! Quite a lot...

41:29.451 --> 41:31.442
Djaq!

41:31.520 --> 41:33.215
Come and join us.

41:34.989 --> 41:38.858
- For good?
- Well, I was thinking just for dinner, but...

41:38.926 --> 41:40.895
And I was thinking for good.

41:42.664 --> 41:45.461
Perhaps I should have let
your big friend here die, huh?

41:45.533 --> 41:47.832
Then there would have been a vacancy.

41:48.469 --> 41:50.664
It wouldn't be safe for you to join us.

41:51.739 --> 41:53.105
For us or for him?

41:55.076 --> 41:57.101
For her.

42:00.014 --> 42:02.312
I guessed as much.

42:03.519 --> 42:07.046
What's your name? Your real name.

42:07.122 --> 42:08.247
Safiyya.

42:09.291 --> 42:10.280
Safiyya...

42:10.358 --> 42:12.451
But I prefer you to call me Djaq.

42:13.295 --> 42:14.455
Djaq!

42:16.365 --> 42:18.356
Well...

42:18.433 --> 42:21.698
your expertise did help to save Little John's life.

42:21.770 --> 42:24.329
For which we will be eternally indebted.

42:25.474 --> 42:27.840
Anyone have a problem with
a woman joining the gang?

42:31.512 --> 42:34.141
- Er... Can you, er...
- I'm a rubbish cook!

42:34.216 --> 42:35.682
Ah!

42:35.750 --> 42:38.913
Well, looks like we're cooking dinner then.

42:45.694 --> 42:47.719
If the fire thing...

42:48.497 --> 42:52.058
was Djaq and not a sign, then...

42:53.101 --> 42:55.262
does that mean I can eat or...

42:56.305 --> 43:02.291
