00:25.640 --> 00:28.479
<i>we were driving up into this
really nice neighborhood,</i>

00:28.480 --> 00:34.399
<i>and we were running down the
stairs of some stranger's backyard,</i>

00:34.400 --> 00:41.863
<i>and then we were swimming
and we were in love.</i>

00:43.480 --> 00:46.319
<i>What we didn't count on was that
even though the lights were off,</i>

00:46.320 --> 00:49.039

night of my life.</i>

[WHISPERS] Ready?

00:55.480 --> 00:58.239
So my idea was, you know,

00:58.240 --> 01:02.870
let's try and re-create that moment.

01:09.400 --> 01:10.839
[WHISPERS] Oh, it's freezing!

01:10.840 --> 01:14.389
It's a little colder
than I remember it.

Do you think he's coming out?

01:17.880 --> 01:20.719
I'm sure. I'm sure
he heard us, right?

01:20.720 --> 01:24.622
Hello? This is fun.

01:25.240 --> 01:26.439
Yeah.

01:26.440 --> 01:28.101
Where is he?

01:29.200 --> 01:31.225
[WHISPERS] Maybe he's not home.

01:32.960 --> 01:36.279
Happy anniversary anyway.

01:36.280 --> 01:38.384
Happy anniversary.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.599

01:49.600 --> 01:52.399
<i>and we were just floating there,</i>

01:52.400 --> 01:55.187
<i>I felt sad,</i>

01:57.880 --> 02:02.319
and I felt like our happiness
used to be so easy

02:02.320 --> 02:04.599
and there used to be so much of it,

02:04.600 --> 02:08.318
and now I feel like
happiness is something

02:08.320 --> 02:10.948
that we have to re-create.

02:11.280 --> 02:12.781
Ah.

02:15.320 --> 02:17.039
I'm sorry. I tried to
make a romantic moment.

02:17.040 --> 02:18.759
I'll never take you to
a fucking pool again.

Okay.

This could be fun.

compatibility exercise.

02:31.560 --> 02:35.679
I want you both to play a
note at the same time, okay?

02:35.680 --> 02:36.839
Just any note?

02:36.840 --> 02:39.342
Yep. Knock yourself out.

[CHUCKLES]

02:41.880 --> 02:44.559
Wow! You guys are
not in sync, are you?

02:44.560 --> 02:45.799
We used to be great.

02:45.800 --> 02:47.239
We used to be really
irreverent and...

02:47.240 --> 02:48.359
Yeah. There was teasing.

02:48.360 --> 02:49.519
- Yeah.
- And stuff. Like I...

02:49.520 --> 02:50.799
I mean no offense...

02:50.800 --> 02:52.399
But I would call you a
bitch and it was funny.

02:52.400 --> 02:53.519
Yeah, it was hilarious.

02:53.520 --> 02:54.639
I used to call you a bitch.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.479
- You thought it was really funny.
- Yeah.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.679
I just don't know how we're
going to move forward

02:58.680 --> 03:00.799
if we keep having this
circular conversation

03:00.800 --> 03:03.759
about me doing what I did

03:03.760 --> 03:05.679
which I have apologized for already,

03:05.680 --> 03:08.439
and we are here because
we are trying to move on.

03:08.440 --> 03:10.719
I don't see why we have
to keep revisiting that

03:10.720 --> 03:12.999
because it's the same
conversation over and over again.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.639
Because you don't get
to decide that, Ethan.

03:15.640 --> 03:17.839
You don't get to decide
when we move on, I do.

...or that one...
...that's pretty, right?

03:29.720 --> 03:33.224
But this... not so much.

03:33.720 --> 03:36.519
Anyway, it's just an exercise.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.359
I want to trust you again.

03:38.360 --> 03:39.599
I want to forgive you.

I want all of those things.

03:40.840 --> 03:43.799
I want us and I want us to work.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.639
I don't know why you feel
like I don't want that.

03:45.640 --> 03:48.711
Because we don't agree on
how we're going to get there.

04:01.960 --> 04:03.791
Where are you?

04:09.840 --> 04:10.959
Okay.

the restaurants. Watch this. Whoop.

So it doesn't drip.
Even though I kind of...

06:55.080 --> 06:56.999
- It kind of dripped.

whether you were so drunk and stoned

we fought, we made up, we had
a nice cuddle, beautiful day.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.439
Sophie, what are you talking about?

15:31.440 --> 15:33.839
We had a fight and you stormed out.

15:33.840 --> 15:34.999
We didn't make up.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.865
Are you okay?

15:36.880 --> 15:39.559
I'm fine, are you okay? I'm...

15:39.560 --> 15:42.079
Okay, Mr. Hangover.

15:42.080 --> 15:43.599
I think it's time for some food. Huh?

15:43.600 --> 15:45.719
Let's get something in your stomach.

15:45.720 --> 15:47.879
You're kind of freaking me
out a little bit, Sophie.

15:47.880 --> 15:51.359
I've got to say... Is that bacon?

15:51.360 --> 15:53.021
Yeah.

15:53.400 --> 15:56.187
You hate it when I eat bacon.

What?

16:49.960 --> 16:51.439
What's going on?

That's what I'm trying to figure out.

16:53.560 --> 16:56.222
I don't understand why
you're doing this.

16:59.240 --> 17:00.319
No.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.839
No, no, no, no.

17:01.840 --> 17:03.079
No what?

17:03.080 --> 17:04.479
This was...
There were plates... Hello?

17:04.480 --> 17:05.679
What are you talking about plates?

17:05.680 --> 17:06.959
Hello, hello? What are you... Ethan?

17:06.960 --> 17:08.839
- Where'd you go?
- Where'd who go?

17:08.839 --> 17:10.546
Ethan?

Hello?

17:11.720 --> 17:13.118
Ethan?

17:13.119 --> 17:14.759
There was bacon right
there on those plates...

17:14.760 --> 17:16.839
What are you talking about?
Ethan, answer me.

17:16.839 --> 17:18.079
You can't... The smell of bacon...

17:18.079 --> 17:20.079
You can't get the smell of
bacon out in five minutes.

17:20.079 --> 17:21.479
- There was bacon...
- What about bacon?

17:21.480 --> 17:22.919
Right here. There was bacon here.

17:22.920 --> 17:25.991
Why are you acting like this?

17:26.599 --> 17:28.559
Shit. Sophie, Sophie.

17:28.560 --> 17:30.079
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

17:30.080 --> 17:31.359
Sophie, Sophie...

17:31.360 --> 17:32.479
- What?
- I'm sorry.

17:32.480 --> 17:33.759
- What?
- I'm sorry, just wait.

17:33.760 --> 17:35.319
I'm spazzing out in there, I know,

17:35.320 --> 17:37.079
but something fucking weird

17:37.080 --> 17:39.359
like Twilight Zone
shit is going on here,

17:39.360 --> 17:42.022
and I'm trying to get
a handle on it, okay?

17:42.080 --> 17:43.599
Last night we had a nice dinner.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.039
We had a blast together, right?

17:45.040 --> 17:46.159
- Yes.
- Okay.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.799
Then, we smoked some pot.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.679
I fell asleep on the couch.

17:49.680 --> 17:51.559
Next thing I know, you woke me up

17:51.560 --> 17:53.599
claiming that we had
just had sex together.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.511
Because we did!

17:56.000 --> 17:57.119
Okay. I came here.

17:57.120 --> 17:58.199
Nobody was here.

17:58.200 --> 17:59.439
I fell asleep on this couch

17:59.440 --> 18:01.599
and I woke up to you snuggling me.

18:01.600 --> 18:02.919
What? What are you talking about?

18:02.920 --> 18:04.199
No, I didn't.

18:04.200 --> 18:05.959
That's crazy to me that you
would deny that, okay?

18:05.960 --> 18:07.639
- I didn't.
- Exactly.

18:07.640 --> 18:09.599
Crazy just like me denying
that I had slept with you.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.559
You know what I'm saying?

18:11.560 --> 18:15.319
We had two completely separate
experiences with each other

18:15.320 --> 18:18.630
that neither of us remembers, and...

18:18.800 --> 18:20.879
Hang on a second. I'm going to
go in there by myself, okay?

18:20.880 --> 18:21.999
Why?

18:22.000 --> 18:23.399
You just stay here
for like 30 seconds.

18:23.400 --> 18:25.061
- Don't move.
- Ethan!

Hey, Babe.

Can you hand me a towel?

19:07.080 --> 19:08.159
You're in that shower.

19:08.160 --> 19:09.839
I just handed you a towel.

19:09.840 --> 19:12.399
Okay, you know what,
I'm not even mad any more.

19:12.400 --> 19:13.999
Now you're just scaring me,

why you're doing this.

Oh, yeah.

19:59.480 --> 20:01.279
It's really nice out, huh?

20:01.280 --> 20:04.519
It's actually a little bright in here.
Do you mind if I close these?

20:04.520 --> 20:06.021
Mmm-mmm.

20:07.920 --> 20:09.919
The morning sun here is insane.

Sorry. I'm a little sweaty.

That's okay.

21:08.120 --> 21:09.746

21:17.640 --> 21:19.426
Fuck this.

21:26.840 --> 21:28.580
You're kidding me!

What the fuck?

I don't know.

22:07.800 --> 22:10.746
This is so crazy.

22:10.840 --> 22:12.479
Did that really happen?

22:12.480 --> 22:14.159
I mean, did that, was that...

22:14.160 --> 22:15.799
I just don't... I don't understand.

22:15.800 --> 22:20.519
Is it another dimension, like
when you go through the door,

22:20.520 --> 22:23.119
is it another plane
of existence or...

22:23.120 --> 22:24.399
I don't know.

22:24.400 --> 22:25.559
I've no clue.

22:25.560 --> 22:29.479
I think we need to just say
some weird shit happened.

22:29.480 --> 22:30.839
We compartmentalize it.

22:30.840 --> 22:33.359
There was a cosmic
aberration of some sort...

22:33.360 --> 22:35.879
- Yeah, yeah. Move on.
- And we go home.

22:35.880 --> 22:38.519
We don't talk about this again,
and we just stop thinking about it.

22:38.520 --> 22:40.079
Okay.

22:40.080 --> 22:42.947
- Yeah. We could move on.
- Done.

22:47.960 --> 22:50.701
Oh my God, I can't stop
thinking about it.

22:52.080 --> 22:53.866
Can you?

22:56.720 --> 22:58.159
We're just going to have to just...

22:58.160 --> 22:59.839
I guess time, you know...

22:59.840 --> 23:02.559
I'm not going to be able to stop
thinking about this, Ethan.

23:02.560 --> 23:03.959
Well, what else can we do?

23:03.960 --> 23:06.303
I mean what are we, what are
we going to do, you know?

23:08.320 --> 23:09.981
Well, I mean, there's the...

23:10.800 --> 23:12.959
There's the crazy thing
to do which is...

23:12.960 --> 23:14.507
What?

23:14.560 --> 23:17.791
Which is to, you know,
explore it further.

23:20.320 --> 23:21.599
Explore it further?

23:21.600 --> 23:23.199
I know you only had
a little bit of it...

23:23.200 --> 23:24.879
Yeah. I was there for
like three seconds.

23:24.880 --> 23:27.999
I know. And I, but I
had a whole evening...

23:28.000 --> 23:30.639
In that house, and I have to say,

23:30.640 --> 23:34.119
I know I sound like a
crazy person right now,

23:34.120 --> 23:37.359
but I have to say it
was kind of magical.

23:37.360 --> 23:38.639
- Well...
- It was...

23:38.640 --> 23:41.439
But don't go overboard
with the whole magic

23:41.440 --> 23:42.679
of what happened there

23:42.680 --> 23:44.199
because I know what
you did in there, okay?

23:44.200 --> 23:45.799
All right. That's not
what I'm talking about.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.319
I'm not talking about
that kind of magic.

23:47.320 --> 23:48.799
There was a rush.

23:48.800 --> 23:52.959
It was exciting. I felt happy.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.119
And it wasn't just that.

23:54.120 --> 23:55.599
It wasn't just the time
in the guest house.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.439
We had a great time
in the main house.

23:58.440 --> 24:00.239
Yes, we did. We had a good time.

24:00.240 --> 24:01.679
It wasn't just the weed.

24:01.680 --> 24:03.759
I mean we were connecting,
we were talking,

24:03.760 --> 24:05.599
we were happy, we were... Happy.

24:05.600 --> 24:06.759
Yes.

24:06.760 --> 24:10.359
We also had a fantastic time when
we did ecstasy at Lalapalooza,

24:10.360 --> 24:13.319
but we're not going to do that every
day of our lives because you die...

24:13.320 --> 24:14.479
- Right.
- Okay?

24:14.480 --> 24:15.959
There's a question
of our safety here.

24:15.960 --> 24:18.759
Yeah. But I didn't feel
like it was dangerous.

24:18.760 --> 24:21.467
I didn't feel... I felt safe.

24:22.760 --> 24:24.279
I didn't feel dangerous, either.

24:24.280 --> 24:25.559
I felt like I was with you.

24:25.560 --> 24:28.519
This is something that we've
been talking about in therapy...

24:28.520 --> 24:31.719
Exploring new options,
creating a new relationship...

24:31.720 --> 24:33.959
Not going back to the past

24:33.960 --> 24:36.239
and re-creating old
things that happened

24:36.240 --> 24:38.079
but starting with new things.

24:38.080 --> 24:39.559
Yeah. Point taken.

24:39.560 --> 24:40.679
I know that this is...

24:40.680 --> 24:42.119
I didn't imagine this sort of...

24:42.120 --> 24:43.319
- ...extreme.
- ...new thing.

24:43.320 --> 24:44.439
Absolutely, but...

24:44.440 --> 24:46.599
I imagined like horseback riding

24:46.600 --> 24:49.439
with a little satchel
of wine, you know?

24:49.440 --> 24:51.159
Not exploring other dimensions

24:51.160 --> 24:53.999
in some weird version of
<i>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</i>

24:54.000 --> 24:56.821
What if this is something
that I want to do?

24:58.760 --> 25:00.479
You want to go back?

25:00.480 --> 25:03.221
I want to help our relationship.

25:12.120 --> 25:15.719
So... A little weird to say this,

25:15.720 --> 25:18.559
but I'm struggling a
little bit with the fact

25:18.560 --> 25:22.906
that you slept with the
other me last night.

25:24.040 --> 25:25.599
Yeah, but I thought it was you.

25:25.600 --> 25:27.239
I know. I'm not mad or blaming you.

25:27.240 --> 25:30.599
I just like...
I'd be lying if I, you know,

25:30.600 --> 25:32.639
didn't say I was a
little jealous, I guess.

25:32.640 --> 25:34.319
All right. I understand,

25:34.320 --> 25:38.222
but obviously I would never
knowingly cheat on you.

25:39.920 --> 25:42.719
So it seems like it only works
if we go in one at a time.

25:42.720 --> 25:43.839
Correct.

25:43.840 --> 25:47.025
So I guess we'll just figure out
who wants to go in there first.

26:12.640 --> 26:15.108

I'll be out in a minute, sweetheart.

26:16.160 --> 26:17.946

26:40.080 --> 26:41.786

26:48.160 --> 26:49.821
Of course.

26:50.760 --> 26:52.466
Come sit with me.

26:53.360 --> 26:55.350
Okay.

27:00.120 --> 27:01.746
So...

27:02.320 --> 27:03.879
So...

27:03.880 --> 27:06.279
Isn't it crazy to think that
we're actually married?

27:06.280 --> 27:08.079
[GIGGLES]

27:08.080 --> 27:09.706

27:17.280 --> 27:19.799
Since we came yesterday, silly.

27:19.800 --> 27:21.599
No, I mean, in the guest house.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.909
Since we slept here last night.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.439
Uh-oh. Someone's in detective mode.

27:26.440 --> 27:27.719
Sorry. I didn't mean to be.

27:27.720 --> 27:30.063
That's okay. I don't mind.

27:30.160 --> 27:32.559
Have you explored the
grounds very much?

27:32.560 --> 27:34.903
I think I have a pretty
good sense of it.

27:35.040 --> 27:36.879
It's so pretty here, isn't it?

27:36.880 --> 27:39.399
It is. Would you like to
go on a walk with me?

Not really right now, but you're
welcome to go on a walk.

27:42.400 --> 27:44.470
It's your vacation, too.

- Fascinating.
- Tell me.

28:02.920 --> 28:07.399
Okay. That being in there is
100% convinced that she is you.

28:07.400 --> 28:08.559
- She is?
- Yeah.

28:08.560 --> 28:10.119

28:10.120 --> 28:11.759
She is unflappable.

28:11.760 --> 28:12.839
I think when you go in there...

28:12.840 --> 28:13.959
God, it's crazy.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.839
Yeah, you throw out some
like very specific examples

28:16.840 --> 28:18.519

28:18.520 --> 28:19.599
Oh, no, no, sweetie.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.319
I don't think we're
supposed to challenge them.

28:21.320 --> 28:24.279

of the fun of this

for me and everyone around us.

talked about the magic show

has to be trust involved,

other about what happens

29:20.120 --> 29:21.439

Oh! Do you do the shrug?

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:35.359
Uh, excuse me. Don't talk to her.

01:08:35.359 --> 01:08:36.599
She's dead. She folded.

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:38.078
It's just you and me now.

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:39.198
You did the shoulder shrug.

01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:40.599
You obviously have a good hand.

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:43.078
It's like a high pair or
maybe even three of a kind.

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:44.279
Fucking raise this shit, man.

01:08:44.279 --> 01:08:46.020
You only live once.

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:47.871
Okay. I'll raise.

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:49.599
Now I know you have the confidence.

Jesus, are you kidding me?

01:08:53.279 --> 01:08:55.919
- What?
- You're right.

01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:58.118
- Pair of aces.
- Ooh!

01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:59.679
Nailed it, nailed it.

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:01.679
I knew you had the aces.

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:03.959
Dude, by the way, you're getting
very good at this game...

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:05.078
Almost too good.

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:08.060
I'm beginning to think this
is like one long Sophie con.

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:11.319
He clearly just let you win.

01:09:11.319 --> 01:09:13.359
Yes, Ethan. Obviously he let me win.

01:09:13.359 --> 01:09:14.439
Come on, guys.

01:09:14.439 --> 01:09:16.590
This is supposed to just
be a friendly game.

01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:19.399
You're not being very
fun to play with.

01:09:19.399 --> 01:09:22.759
The reason he's not being fun
is because he's not even playing.

01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:24.078
Ethan, if you want to win the game,

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:25.999
you've got to play some hands, okay?

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.626
That's just how it works.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.069
All right. Fine. I'll play.

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:34.559
Deal me in. You and me.

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:35.679
Come on.

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:37.670
You want to play one on...

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:40.399
Okay. All right. That's the spirit.

01:09:40.399 --> 01:09:41.919
Come on, buddy.
Let's get in the game.

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:43.466
Let's go.

01:09:46.479 --> 01:09:47.981
Mmm-hmm.

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:51.919
All right.

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:54.104
How many cards do you want?

01:09:54.279 --> 01:09:55.359
I'm fine with what I have.

01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:57.146
Thank you very much.

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:58.679
Sticking with what you have.

01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:00.199
All right. I'll stick
with what I have, too.

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:01.781
What's your move?

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:06.301
I'm all in.

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:07.999
Oh!

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.239
All in, bold move!

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:13.061
But you've got to be impulsive
sometimes. I really like it.

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:14.159
All right, so you're all in,

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:18.142
and now I've got to figure
out what is your tell.

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:19.919
You've got that restless
leg thing going on

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:21.639
but I think it's just nerves.

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:23.399
You've been chewing on
the lower lip a little bit,

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.679
but I get ulcers in there, too,

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:27.919
so maybe that's just what that is.

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.199
So weird lip...

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:31.319
Oh!

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:34.027
Oh, shit! Of course. There it is.

and he knows it.

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:41.507
Sorry, buddy, but I've got
to call you on this one.

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:43.701
What you got?

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:48.340
Whatever.

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:52.381
You have nothing and I
win with an ace high.

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:53.879
Sorry about that, man.

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:57.190
It's fun playing with you, but you've
got to work on your bluffing skills.

01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:58.879
You win.

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:00.359
You're an amazing liar.

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:02.559

- Ethan, Jesus. Calm down.

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:06.919
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:08.399
I don't want to take
all the credit here.

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:11.346
You're a pretty decent
liar yourself, right?

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.119
What are you talking about?

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:19.599
Do you want to tell her or should I?

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:20.759
Is this necessary?

01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:22.959
I think it's important that
Sophie knows what's going on.

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:24.079
We're all friends here, right?

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:26.599
Uh, would everybody just tell
me what we're talking about?

01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:27.879

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:29.039

ETHAN 2: All right, look,

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:34.639
Ethan was a little suspicious that
something was going on between us,

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:37.479
so he decided to try and
figure it out for himself.

01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:39.359
It was actually kind
of a brilliant move.

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:40.839
He didn't go to the grocery store.

01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:43.439
He ended up sneaking
into the guest house,

01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:45.479
and in a strange twist of events,

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:49.079
he pretended to be me,

01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:52.759
so you actually slept
with Ethan instead of me.

01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:56.039

to be you... I am me.

are you talking about?

you by sleeping with someone else

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:14.908

you by sleeping with you.

to make like a thing here.
