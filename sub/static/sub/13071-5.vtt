00:01.335 --> 00:02.770
* Previously on BrainDead... *

00:52.353 --> 00:53.787
What'd you say?

01:07.735 --> 01:10.404
(inhales, groans)

01:14.642 --> 01:16.177
What?

01:16.210 --> 01:19.413
I said, "Sorry about sleeping on
the couch.

01:19.447 --> 01:20.514
I think I nodded off."

01:29.557 --> 01:30.558
Can you not hear me?

01:30.591 --> 01:32.493
Oh, a bit.

01:32.526 --> 01:34.128
What'd you say?

01:35.663 --> 01:37.565
"Sorry about sleeping on the
couch.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.233
I think I nodded off."

01:39.267 --> 01:42.370
Oh.
(chuckles)

01:42.403 --> 01:43.737
So that ear's better?

01:43.771 --> 01:46.374
Uh, yeah.

01:46.407 --> 01:48.676
It's probably my tinnitus.

01:48.709 --> 01:51.345
I didn't notice it last night.

01:51.379 --> 01:52.813
Well, it's always worse
in the morning.

01:52.846 --> 01:55.549
How'd you sleep?

01:55.583 --> 01:56.817
Well.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.486
You?
Good.

01:58.519 --> 01:59.453
I have to get to work.

01:59.487 --> 02:02.756
These field office meetings.
I hate being late.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.492
Can I use your restroom?
Sure.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.872
Anthony, did you change
the sheets?

02:20.208 --> 02:22.776
Yeah, I-I hope that's all right.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.279
I, uh... I can be a bit anal,

02:25.313 --> 02:26.480
and there was a... you know,

02:26.514 --> 02:29.483
a wet spot.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.352
Where are the dirty ones?

02:31.385 --> 02:32.786
In the pantry.

02:32.820 --> 02:35.589
I saw you had a washer,
I just threw them in.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.825
Again, I hope that's all right.

02:41.862 --> 02:42.963
Laurel?

02:42.996 --> 02:44.765
Yeah, yeah, it's all right.

02:44.798 --> 02:46.500
Good.
(sniffs) Hmm.

02:46.534 --> 02:47.801
I smell like an ox.

02:52.440 --> 02:53.507
I'll call you later.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.409
Thanks for a great night.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.634
Why?
What did he do?

03:20.668 --> 03:22.570
Nothing, he just had trouble
hearing in one ear.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.638
Oh, my God, he's a bug man.
No, stop.

03:24.672 --> 03:27.275
He's cleaning your sheets
while you're sleeping?

03:27.308 --> 03:29.710
Seriously, is that something
guys usually do?
Okay, I'm getting back to work.

03:29.743 --> 03:32.513
Laurel, he's a bug man.
He could kill you.

03:32.546 --> 03:33.581
What did he say?

03:33.614 --> 03:35.616
Nothing.
He had to rush off.

03:35.649 --> 03:38.452
Right, to commune
with other bug people.

03:38.486 --> 03:40.554
You're looking at me like I'm
crazy. I'm making sense here.

03:40.588 --> 03:43.624
If he was infected,
why wasn't Laurel infected?

03:43.657 --> 03:45.426
Because you were sleeping
on the couch,

03:45.459 --> 03:47.628
at least that's what you said,
so the bugs just got to him.

03:47.661 --> 03:48.629
Okay, can we return
to the subject here?

03:48.662 --> 03:50.831
This is the subject.

03:50.864 --> 03:53.267
What do we do with the CDC?

03:53.301 --> 03:54.835
I called Wu again.
He wants to help,

03:54.868 --> 03:56.437
but he's running into some
political headwinds at work.

03:56.470 --> 03:59.940
What does that mean?
He needs someone to apply
pressure to his boss at the CDC.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.975
How do we do that?
We don't do that.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.578
You do.

04:04.612 --> 04:06.980
No, no.

04:07.014 --> 04:10.384
I can't talk to my brother
about this stuff.

04:10.418 --> 04:12.286
He's very practical.
He'll think we're insane...

04:12.320 --> 04:15.356
Yes, if you tell him we're
investigating brain-eating bugs.

04:15.389 --> 04:16.223
But Lyme disease

04:16.256 --> 04:17.725
and Zika are just
as weird as this.

04:17.758 --> 04:19.627
We've come to accept it,
but it's the same

04:19.660 --> 04:22.062
type of parasite.
Okay. Okay, I'll think on it.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.397
Good.

04:23.431 --> 04:25.699
And, uh... I'm leaving these.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.568
What are those?
Sedatives to give

04:27.601 --> 04:29.437
to your bug man.
I'm not giving him sedatives.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.772
The only way to know if he's
clean is to give him a CAT scan,

04:31.805 --> 04:33.741
and we know
bug people don't want that.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.743
And, uh...

04:35.776 --> 04:38.011
Here are some
brass knuckles, too.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.880
I'm going back to work.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.949
Can you stop calling them
"bug people," please?

04:41.982 --> 04:43.684
Take those.

04:43.717 --> 04:46.687
So is that who you were
sleeping with last night?

04:46.720 --> 04:48.489
What?

04:48.522 --> 04:50.424
I called back last night
to thank you for the help

04:50.458 --> 04:51.725
with Amarant
when some guy picked up.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.394
Imagine my surprise.

04:53.427 --> 04:54.728
No, it wasn't him.

04:54.762 --> 04:57.565
No, so... who was it?

04:57.598 --> 04:59.099
Just someone.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.702
Oh, that's right, my life's
an open book, but Laurel...

05:01.735 --> 05:02.970
It's Anthony,
Anthony the FBI guy.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.772
Oh, yeah.
Is it serious?

05:04.805 --> 05:06.640
No, of course not.
Laurel doesn't do serious.

05:06.674 --> 05:07.775
Why am I being attacked
this morning?

05:07.808 --> 05:09.710
Have you noticed, you never give
guys a second chance?

05:09.743 --> 05:12.045
They always do one thing wrong,
(snaps) and you drop them.

05:13.681 --> 05:14.682
Oh, my God, is that true?

05:14.715 --> 05:16.584
We're snobs.
Face it.

05:16.617 --> 05:17.651
The Healy children.

05:17.685 --> 05:18.919
No one's up to our standards.

05:20.421 --> 05:21.889
Okay.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.424
Got to address the troops.

05:23.457 --> 05:25.426
(door opens)

05:34.735 --> 05:36.904
(ringtone playing)

05:36.937 --> 05:38.372
LAUREL:
Hey, what are you doing?

05:38.406 --> 05:39.707
Not much.
What about you?

05:39.740 --> 05:41.875
Oh, you know,
just saving the world.

05:41.909 --> 05:44.745
(chuckles)

05:44.778 --> 05:46.780
I'm sorry if I was...

05:46.814 --> 05:48.015
weird this morning.

05:48.048 --> 05:50.384
Oh, you weren't the weird one,
I was.

05:50.418 --> 05:52.553
Showing you
my feminine cleaning side.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.688
If that's the worst thing
you show me, we'll be fine.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.524
You want to get dinner tonight?

05:56.557 --> 05:57.825
I can't.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.693
I'm supposed to go
to this party tonight

05:59.727 --> 06:01.028
for the government reopening...

06:04.532 --> 06:05.999
Actually, do you want to come?

06:06.033 --> 06:08.802
It's a work event, everybody
trying to be bipartisan.

06:08.836 --> 06:10.971
Yeah, sounds fun.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.440
(laughing):
No, it doesn't.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.675
No, it does. What time?
8:00.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.977
We have to stay at least
an hour, but then we can...

06:17.010 --> 06:19.447
I'll make you dinner.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.615
Oh, okay.

06:21.649 --> 06:22.783
Good.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.952
See you then.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.420
Bye.

06:30.157 --> 06:32.159
LUKE:
Give yourselves a hand.

06:32.192 --> 06:33.794
(applause)

06:33.827 --> 06:35.696
We're back!
MAN:
Yes, we are.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.031
The government is open for
business, so let's show

06:38.065 --> 06:39.867
the people of Maryland
what we can do.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.969
(cheering and applause)
All right.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.177
So where you all from?
Baltimore, Senator.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.845
I'm Private Blaine.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.747
This is Private
First Class Tulley.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.048
Hey.
And Lance Corporal Middleton.

06:55.082 --> 06:57.751
Uh, actually, I'm from
Cumberland.

06:57.785 --> 06:58.852
Wouldn't be caught dead in
Baltimore.

06:58.886 --> 07:00.821
(chuckles)
Even though I probably will.

07:00.854 --> 07:03.557
Well, let's not hope for that.
(laughter)

07:03.591 --> 07:05.826
This is my sister, Laurel.

07:05.859 --> 07:08.462
She takes care of constituents.
We know. We were briefed.

07:08.496 --> 07:09.463
What are those there,
Lance Corporal?

07:09.497 --> 07:11.932
Toys for my one-year-old.

07:11.965 --> 07:15.035
Her car seat hooks into my
wheelchair here and here.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.136
You have a one-year-old?

07:16.169 --> 07:17.805
Lilly.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.740
Best thing ever happened to me.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.975
You should see us both crawling
on the floor.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.811
(grunts)

07:23.844 --> 07:26.747
(laughter)
LUKE: Why don't you all
come on back and

07:26.780 --> 07:28.616
let's talk.
You sure?

07:28.649 --> 07:30.117
They told us not to press
you, Senator.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.885
It'd just be Laurel
hearing our bitching.

07:31.919 --> 07:33.754
Hey, if you want me gone...

07:33.787 --> 07:35.856
No, no!
No, no, no, no, no, no.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.060
We were enrolled in
the clinical drug trials,

07:40.093 --> 07:42.796
and they were halted during
the government shutdown.

07:42.830 --> 07:45.933
We need Congress to get
NIH to restore funding,

07:45.966 --> 07:48.836
and some of us don't
have a lot of time.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.103
Meaning?

07:50.137 --> 07:51.905
Me.
Liver cancer.

07:51.939 --> 07:55.242
In fact, I wasn't
gonna come today.

07:55.275 --> 07:56.844
It's hard to pull myself
away from Lilly

07:56.877 --> 07:58.779
when she's ready to walk, but...

07:58.812 --> 08:00.714
I convinced him.

08:00.748 --> 08:01.849
He's the most critical.

08:01.882 --> 08:04.618
How critical?
SHEILA: Ten days.

08:04.652 --> 08:07.721
Don't sugarcoat it, Sheila.
Give it to them straight.

08:07.755 --> 08:09.857
I'm just hoping to make it
to Lilly's first birthday.

08:09.890 --> 08:10.991
When is that?

08:11.024 --> 08:14.261
July 4.
(chuckles)

08:14.294 --> 08:16.530
I know.
Corny, huh?

08:16.564 --> 08:17.765
Wow.

08:17.798 --> 08:19.066
Yeah.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.934
You know what's the best
thing about my job?

08:20.968 --> 08:22.202
I can't imagine.

08:22.235 --> 08:24.071
I can do something about that.

08:24.104 --> 08:26.940
I'm heading to the Committee
on Veteran Affairs right now.

08:26.974 --> 08:28.942
No one votes against veterans,
so this'll be handled

08:28.976 --> 08:30.811
by the end of the day.
You sure?

08:30.844 --> 08:31.879
Oh, yeah.

08:31.912 --> 08:33.213
Good, 'cause I liked him.

08:33.246 --> 08:36.083
I know.
Me, too.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.751
I have something
to ask of you.

08:37.785 --> 08:39.653
What?
I didn't ask anything of you.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.922
You're on some committee giving
funding to the CDC.

08:41.955 --> 08:43.624
And they're saying that
these fatal strokes are because

08:43.657 --> 08:44.625
of some bad
blood pressure medicine,

08:44.658 --> 08:45.759
but we think they're wrong.

08:45.793 --> 08:46.994
"We," meaning
those two people

08:47.027 --> 08:48.128
in the conference
room with you?

08:48.161 --> 08:50.598
We're in touch with
a Dr. Wu at the CDC.

08:50.631 --> 08:52.900
He needs some political
pressure applied to his bosses

08:52.933 --> 08:54.234
for them to look
at other theories.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.637
All you need to do is drop
a word and they'll jump.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.271
Okay, here's the thing, Laurel.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.307
I'm gonna share with you a
wonderful little civics lesson

09:00.340 --> 09:02.042
about the glory of our
system of government.

09:02.075 --> 09:04.845
Oh, boy.
Everybody hates everybody.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.714
If the CDC were wrong about

09:06.747 --> 09:09.216
blood pressure medicine, the
FDA would scream bloody murder

09:09.249 --> 09:11.118
because they approved it.

09:11.151 --> 09:13.587
See, that's how I know your
friends are wrong. (stammers)

09:13.621 --> 09:15.689
No one's screaming.
Talk to you later, I'm late.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.325
(sirens wailing in distance)

09:24.331 --> 09:25.232
Mr. Chairman,

09:25.265 --> 09:27.601
as a first order of business,

09:27.635 --> 09:29.336
let's fast-track the refunding
of drug trials for veterans.

09:29.369 --> 09:30.337
No one's against it.

09:30.370 --> 09:31.839
It's not on the agenda.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.040
There's a vet from Afghanistan

09:33.073 --> 09:34.775
who won't survive the week
if we delay.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.145
Okay, I'll put you first
in the rotation.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.047
After the kiosk naming.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.983
Ed Sharie.

09:43.016 --> 09:44.251
His widow's here.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.354
Right, got it.

09:47.387 --> 09:48.889
It'll go fast.
Everyone's for it.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.992
Okay.
(clears throat)

09:52.025 --> 09:54.061
Let's get started.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.796
Last session,
we were considering

09:55.829 --> 09:58.999
renaming the West Entrance
Capitol Kiosk

09:59.032 --> 10:01.969
the Sharie Kiosk
after Ed Sharie,

10:02.002 --> 10:03.704
a decorated
Capitol police officer

10:03.737 --> 10:06.039
who was killed
in the line of duty.

10:06.073 --> 10:08.075
And if there are no objections,
I move we so vote.

10:08.108 --> 10:08.942
I second...

10:08.976 --> 10:10.644
RED: Mr. Chairman,
point of information.

10:10.678 --> 10:15.248
Are we really considering having
a Capitol kiosk,

10:15.282 --> 10:18.919
a kiosk where little kids
can buy candy bars,

10:18.952 --> 10:22.089
christened with a name sounding
like "Sharia"?

10:26.093 --> 10:27.761
I'm sorry, what?

10:27.795 --> 10:31.932
I said, I'm wondering if this
committee is fully aware

10:31.965 --> 10:36.103
that this name will sound to
many visitors like "Sharia law"?

10:36.136 --> 10:39.106
Senator,
it's not named after Sharia.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.774
It's named after Sharie.

10:40.808 --> 10:42.009
Ed Sharie.

10:42.042 --> 10:43.977
With an "E."
I'm not deaf, Senator.

10:44.011 --> 10:46.680
I-I know the difference between
an "A" and an "E."

10:46.714 --> 10:47.748
But not everyone does,

10:47.781 --> 10:49.016
and therein lies
the confusion,

10:49.049 --> 10:50.450
Mr. Chairman.
Wait,

10:50.483 --> 10:52.119
do you honestly think
people are gonna...

10:52.152 --> 10:55.222
I think many of us are concerned
about political ads,

10:55.255 --> 10:59.159
which will suggest that
we voted for "Sharia law."

10:59.192 --> 11:01.161
Yeah, but... you didn't, so...

11:01.194 --> 11:02.696
This is what I suggest.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.231
Mr. Chairman, this kiosk,

11:04.264 --> 11:09.302
where I have enjoyed a coffee
and a pastry many times,

11:09.336 --> 11:12.005
I believe it should be named
after Ronald Reagan.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.473
Oh, for God's sake.
(all murmuring)

11:13.506 --> 11:14.742
Yes, 'cause we haven't
named enough things

11:14.775 --> 11:15.743
after Ronald Reagan.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.144
Wouldn't that be nice?

11:17.177 --> 11:18.345
(overlapping chatter)

11:18.378 --> 11:20.147
(gavel banging)

11:20.180 --> 11:22.716
Okay, look.
I would like to point out

11:22.750 --> 11:26.186
to you, sir,
that Officer Sharie was not only

11:26.219 --> 11:28.255
a dedicated
Capitol police officer

11:28.288 --> 11:30.057
but a decorated veteran.

11:30.090 --> 11:33.927
I understand that, and I do not
mean Officer Sharia

11:33.961 --> 11:35.028
any disrespect

11:35.062 --> 11:36.096
when I suggest

11:36.129 --> 11:38.065
that our former president
was a veteran as well.

11:38.098 --> 11:39.933
No, he wasn't.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.935
Well, yes, he was.
He served in World War II.

11:41.969 --> 11:45.105
No, he made a movie in which
he served in World War II.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.774
And a very good one--
King's Row,

11:46.807 --> 11:49.342
in which he lost both his legs.
ELLA:
Mr. Chairman,

11:49.376 --> 11:53.747
I find this entire
proposal an outrage.

11:53.781 --> 11:56.283
When can we name
something after a woman?

11:56.316 --> 11:58.285
Tell a woman to do something,

11:58.318 --> 12:01.521
then we will consider naming
something...

12:01.554 --> 12:02.489
Emma Goldman!

12:02.522 --> 12:05.292
Why can't we call it
the Emma Goldman kiosk?

12:05.325 --> 12:06.894
Are you serious?
A communist?

12:06.927 --> 12:08.028
No, she was
an honored socialist.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.963
She was a communist!
No, she was not,

12:09.997 --> 12:11.198
learn your facts.
You want a woman?

12:11.231 --> 12:13.000
How about Nancy Reagan?

12:13.033 --> 12:14.968
Or Ayn Rand?
Ayn Rand.

12:15.002 --> 12:16.536
SENATOR: And you know,
I-I don't know about

12:16.569 --> 12:18.906
"kiosk" anyway, I mean,
isn't that a French word?

12:18.939 --> 12:22.042
RED: It is. It is a French word.
I think it should be
Reagan Concessions.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.111
Yes, except not
"concessions" because Reagan

12:24.144 --> 12:26.847
never conceded to anything.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.182
(arguing continues)

12:29.216 --> 12:31.384
Can't get one damned thing done.

12:33.486 --> 12:35.222
Bastards.

12:37.324 --> 12:39.927
What is that, Armed Services?

12:39.960 --> 12:41.328
No.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.130
CDC.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.398
They're covering their ass
by pointing fingers at us.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.000
Who's us?

12:47.034 --> 12:48.035
The FDA.

12:49.369 --> 12:52.339
That the...
blood pressure medicine?

12:52.372 --> 12:55.242
Yeah.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.910
How'd you know that?

12:59.512 --> 13:01.849
So...

13:01.882 --> 13:03.150
if it's not this
blood pressure medicine,

13:03.183 --> 13:05.085
what is it?
Excuse me?

13:05.118 --> 13:08.121
These strokes, if it's not about
the blood pressure medicine,

13:08.155 --> 13:09.857
what's causing them?

13:12.225 --> 13:14.227
*

13:23.070 --> 13:24.571
(jazz piano playing)

13:30.110 --> 13:31.444
Hey, you're late.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.847
It's 8:20.
Yeah, this isn't L.A.

13:33.881 --> 13:36.316
D.C. expects you on time
and to leave on time.

13:36.349 --> 13:37.584
Hey, I like your guy.

13:37.617 --> 13:39.286
My guy?
Yeah, your Fed.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.954
Where is he?

13:40.988 --> 13:42.956
At least Norway offers free
college education to anyone...

13:42.990 --> 13:44.958
Then go live there.

13:44.992 --> 13:46.960
No, seriously, you
want to live in Norway,
No, see, that's...

13:46.994 --> 13:48.195
then go.
That's always
the Republicans' response.

13:48.228 --> 13:49.863
My country, love it or
leave it.
(chuckles)

13:49.897 --> 13:51.298
Hey, what's up?
Laurel,

13:51.331 --> 13:53.100
hi, I didn't know there were
gonna be

13:53.133 --> 13:54.968
so many
ignorant Republicans here.

13:55.002 --> 13:57.004
This little fella here thought
he could just spread his lies

13:57.037 --> 13:59.606
without fear of contradiction.
ANTHONY:
You know what Maureen Dowd

13:59.639 --> 14:01.975
calls people who make up
their own facts?
If you take facts...

14:02.009 --> 14:03.076
Apple cart owners.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.444
Apple cart owners, okay.

14:04.477 --> 14:07.014
(Anthony and Red
continue arguing)

14:08.281 --> 14:10.517
Hey, I see they finally found
something you can do.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.886
Oh, you coming to
check out your old offices?

14:12.920 --> 14:15.122
Is it making you feel nostalgic?
Well, this is an improvement.

14:15.155 --> 14:16.589
Can I get you a drink, ma'am?

14:16.623 --> 14:19.192
Sure.
Old Fashioned.

14:19.226 --> 14:20.560
What's that?

14:20.593 --> 14:22.930
That is a spinach
and celery smoothie.

14:22.963 --> 14:23.931
Would you like one?
No.

14:23.964 --> 14:24.932
Good choice.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.199
So it's not true, by the way.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.534
Your little smear campaign.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.236
(chuckles)
"My little..."
Anthony.

14:29.269 --> 14:30.938
The torture report.
Mm.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.940
He was a whistleblower,
not a waterboarder.

14:32.973 --> 14:35.008
I could see how you
would confuse the two.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.143
It's the same amount
of syllables.

14:36.176 --> 14:38.378
Really?
Is that what he said?

14:38.411 --> 14:40.981
A whistleblower?

14:41.014 --> 14:41.881
(arguing continues)

14:43.050 --> 14:45.085
Here's your drink, ma'am.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.319
What's this?

14:46.353 --> 14:49.156
That is a
cherry blossom garnish.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.124
The senator suggested it.

14:51.158 --> 14:52.425
I'm good, thanks.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.063
ROCHELLE:
He insisted on coming.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.565
Okay, but, Gustav, you
need to keep it together.

14:58.598 --> 15:00.934
Why does everybody think
that I can't handle myself?

15:00.968 --> 15:02.402
He's giving us ten minutes.
That's it.

15:02.435 --> 15:06.039
We only talk about the
screwworms, okay? Hmm?

15:07.707 --> 15:09.009
ROCHELLE:
It's not as odd

15:09.042 --> 15:10.377
as it may sound.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.212
Lyme disease and Zika
also involve

15:12.245 --> 15:14.181
a foreign entomological organism

15:14.214 --> 15:17.150
infecting human blood.
And Lyme disease affects

15:17.184 --> 15:18.318
300,000 Americans a year.

15:18.351 --> 15:19.586
Yes, and that's not it,
there's...

15:21.054 --> 15:22.389
(clears throat)

15:22.422 --> 15:23.957
Yes, what they say is true.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.030
These are small.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.064
They're from a cat.

15:32.399 --> 15:35.168
A CAT scan from a cat?

15:35.202 --> 15:37.337
Luke, things are weird
until they're not.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.072
Yes, except
when they stay weird.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.373
So, what are the symptoms?

15:40.407 --> 15:42.742
As far as we can tell,

15:42.775 --> 15:45.112
deafness in one ear,
some imbalance,

15:45.145 --> 15:46.746
a heightened aggressiveness,

15:46.779 --> 15:51.284
disinterest in intimacy
and sexual connection,

15:51.318 --> 15:53.086
an aversion to alcohol,

15:53.120 --> 15:55.455
and in some severe
cases, death.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.958
And that's how your father died?

16:00.127 --> 16:01.428
Yes.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.997
I never met him, but I talked to
him on the phone.

16:04.031 --> 16:04.998
He was quite impressive.

16:05.032 --> 16:06.166
Thank you.

16:06.199 --> 16:08.268
Okay, this is what I can do.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.137
Look, I need to deal
with Veteran Affairs first.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.738
How's that going?
It'll happen.

16:11.771 --> 16:14.307
But not yet?
It'll happen.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.009
Look, I need
to sit down

16:16.043 --> 16:18.345
with the CDC spokesperson

16:18.378 --> 16:20.780
and discuss it,
but I need for you

16:20.813 --> 16:23.783
to talk with this
congressional adviser first.
Who is he?

16:23.816 --> 16:25.452
She. Dr. Alaimo.
(pen clicks)

16:25.485 --> 16:27.020
A renowned entomologist.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.188
I want her advice

16:28.221 --> 16:30.057
before I go make
a fool of myself.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.691
Thank you, Senator.

16:31.724 --> 16:34.661
And maybe don't show her
the "cat" scan.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.096
Yes, sir.

16:39.399 --> 16:41.401
I'm sorry about your father.

16:45.072 --> 16:46.673
He thinks we're crazy.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.108
No.

16:48.141 --> 16:49.509
No, he'll do what he says.

16:51.444 --> 16:52.745
Mm.

16:52.779 --> 16:53.813
So...

16:53.846 --> 16:56.149
We put in our one hour?
We did.

16:56.183 --> 16:58.051
So let me make you dinner.

16:59.452 --> 17:00.687
What's that?

17:00.720 --> 17:02.055
This?

17:02.089 --> 17:04.657
Celery and spinach.
Want to try some?

17:04.691 --> 17:06.159
No, thanks.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.495
You want some of mine?

17:10.130 --> 17:11.398
Is it apple juice?

17:11.431 --> 17:13.166
No, it's-it's an Old Fashioned.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.135
No, thanks, though.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.813
Sorry, it's a bit messy.

17:26.846 --> 17:28.081
Really?
Where?

17:28.115 --> 17:30.617
The closets.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.685
Very messy.

17:32.719 --> 17:36.323
Okay, one amazing
vegan meal coming up

17:36.356 --> 17:39.692
with just a little cinnamon,
for fun.

17:39.726 --> 17:43.496
You know what Maureen Dowd
calls Republicans?

17:43.530 --> 17:44.797
Apple cart owners.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.633
(scoffs)
She's so right.

17:46.666 --> 17:49.502
Uh-huh.

17:49.536 --> 17:50.770
Hey, are we okay?

17:50.803 --> 17:53.106
I think so.

17:53.140 --> 17:56.876
You just seem
a little standoffish.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.379
No, I...
I just...

17:59.412 --> 18:02.549
I want to give you space.
I don't want to...

18:02.582 --> 18:04.551
rush things.

18:04.584 --> 18:05.685
Give me your hand.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.554
It's not an obligation.

18:10.257 --> 18:11.258
(crash)

18:11.291 --> 18:12.892
Anthony?

18:12.925 --> 18:14.627
Anthony?

18:14.661 --> 18:15.728
(dialing)

18:15.762 --> 18:16.896
(knocking on door)

18:16.929 --> 18:19.132
GUSTAV:
Laurel, open up, it's me.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.272
Yes. Oh.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.539
Help me flip him over.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.141
What the hell?

18:28.175 --> 18:29.909
Come on.
We only have ten minutes.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.811
I put 12 sedatives
in his power drink.

18:31.844 --> 18:33.480
Gustav, you could've killed him!

18:33.513 --> 18:35.282
He'll wake up with a
headache, that's all.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.150
Don't you want to know
if he's a bug?

18:37.184 --> 18:39.286
What is that?
What are you doing?

18:39.319 --> 18:40.553
It's how they draw out

18:40.587 --> 18:42.555
screwworms in
Central America.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.191
It's like a match with a tick.

18:44.224 --> 18:45.258
This is insane.

18:45.292 --> 18:46.393
They're drawn to the bacon.

18:46.426 --> 18:48.328
You're making this up.
Check Wikipedia.

18:48.361 --> 18:49.562
Well, maybe he's not infected.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.198
We don't even know
if he's infected.

18:51.231 --> 18:52.265
Has he drunk alcohol?

18:52.299 --> 18:54.767
Has he been... intimate?

18:54.801 --> 18:56.769
Has he become
more argumentative?

18:56.803 --> 18:58.638
(clicks tongue) Then we
need to examine his ears.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.273
Which is the one he's deaf in?

19:00.307 --> 19:02.309
(pounding on door)

19:02.342 --> 19:04.544
Who is that?
I don't know.

19:04.577 --> 19:06.413
This is not gonna look good.

19:06.446 --> 19:07.747
You think?

19:07.780 --> 19:09.249
(pounding continues)

19:13.786 --> 19:15.255
WOMAN:
Tony, is she in there?

19:16.989 --> 19:19.226
You are such a scumbag.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.596
You could at least tell me
to my face about your whore!

19:26.333 --> 19:28.668
(ringtone plays)

19:28.701 --> 19:30.537
I hear that, Tony!

19:30.570 --> 19:33.740
That is not your ringtone!

19:33.773 --> 19:35.208
(keys jangling, latch unlocking)

19:35.242 --> 19:36.976
I'm coming in.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.379
(phone ringing)
Out the back.
Out the back, go.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.385
I am very close
to pummeling you.

19:45.418 --> 19:47.220
Hey, hey, it worked
out, didn't it?

19:47.254 --> 19:48.788
No, it didn't.
What worked out?

19:48.821 --> 19:50.290
Look, maybe he's not a bug.

19:50.323 --> 19:51.958
Maybe he's just a bastard.

19:51.991 --> 19:53.860
(ringtone plays)

19:53.893 --> 19:55.428
Yes, hi?

19:55.462 --> 19:56.996
Yeah, actually Luke is
still working on that.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.932
He thinks he'll hear news
from Veteran Affairs tomorrow.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.968
Why?

20:03.936 --> 20:06.639
Oh, no.
Which hospital?

20:10.610 --> 20:12.279
How is he?

20:12.312 --> 20:14.947
The nurse says he's in the early
stages of hepatic failure.

20:14.981 --> 20:18.251
Reversible if he gets the meds.

20:18.285 --> 20:19.486
I'm saying it's going well.
Is it?

20:19.519 --> 20:21.288
Not yet, but it will.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.255
Will it in time?

20:22.289 --> 20:23.290
Laurel...

20:28.027 --> 20:29.296
Hmm.

20:29.329 --> 20:31.531
Lilly.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.436
(sighs)

20:36.469 --> 20:39.572
Can I get a copy of this photo?

20:39.606 --> 20:42.275
Probably, why?

20:42.309 --> 20:43.510
It can help.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.618
(sighs)

20:51.651 --> 20:52.785
What we think is...

20:52.819 --> 20:54.287
Shh!

20:55.688 --> 20:56.989
Why am I looking at this?

20:57.023 --> 20:58.558
Cochliomyia hominivorax.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.560
This is a CAT scan.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.061
This is not
Cochliomyia hominivorax.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.896
ROCHELLE:
Yes.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.433
We believe there's a screwworm
in the brain of the patient.

21:08.067 --> 21:09.469
Who are you again?

21:09.502 --> 21:11.438
Oh, my God.
Just, just...

21:11.471 --> 21:13.573
Show her the video.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.342
Come on.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.415
What am I looking at here?

21:22.449 --> 21:23.483
That isn't a bug.

21:23.516 --> 21:24.951
Just give it a second, ma'am.

21:34.561 --> 21:35.595
What is that?

21:35.628 --> 21:36.796
We think it's a screwworm.

21:36.829 --> 21:37.797
It's been burrowing into...

21:37.830 --> 21:40.099
That is not a screwworm.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.267
We think it's a hybrid.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.503
You can think all you want,
but that is not something

21:43.536 --> 21:45.605
I've ever seen in my life.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.840
Where did you find it?

21:47.874 --> 21:49.075
In my apartment.

21:49.108 --> 21:50.810
No, no, show me on a map here.

21:57.049 --> 21:58.485
There.

21:58.518 --> 21:59.686
Has anyone else seen this?

21:59.719 --> 22:03.089
Uh, yes, we think a friend
of mine was infected by some,

22:03.122 --> 22:04.991
playing chess...

22:05.024 --> 22:07.026
here.
And Laurel said she saw some
in her apartment.

22:07.059 --> 22:08.461
Which is here.

22:08.495 --> 22:09.996
Good.

22:10.029 --> 22:12.932
Infestation clusters.

22:12.965 --> 22:14.667
Let me find some pins.

22:17.069 --> 22:19.606
We should probably talk
this out, shouldn't we?
We should.

22:19.639 --> 22:21.608
You know, it was good to
see you at the party last night.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.943
I love it when Republicans
and Democrats can, you know,

22:23.976 --> 22:25.578
blah-blah-blah.

22:25.612 --> 22:27.914
Yeah. So why are you delaying
the clinical trial vote?

22:27.947 --> 22:29.849
I'm not delaying anything.

22:29.882 --> 22:32.385
I'm urging us not to
name a concession stand

22:32.419 --> 22:34.787
after Sharia law.
It is not Sharia law.

22:34.821 --> 22:37.490
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
tell me again, but slower.

22:37.524 --> 22:39.592
'Cause you know how much
I love to be patronized.

22:39.626 --> 22:42.128
All right, this government is up
and running less than two days,

22:42.161 --> 22:43.430
and we're deadlocked over

22:43.463 --> 22:44.597
a concession stand.

22:44.631 --> 22:46.132
Go talk to Comrade Pollack.

22:46.165 --> 22:47.634
It's not just me.

22:50.437 --> 22:51.471
What's that?

22:51.504 --> 22:52.605
A one-year-old named Lilly.

22:52.639 --> 22:54.574
Sweet.

22:54.607 --> 22:56.476
An illegitimate child of yours?

22:56.509 --> 22:57.343
She is the daughter

22:57.376 --> 22:59.712
of an Iraqi War
veteran who's dying

22:59.746 --> 23:02.615
of liver cancer unless we
pass these clinical trials.

23:04.817 --> 23:06.586
What's the veteran's name?

23:06.619 --> 23:07.787
Brett Middleton.

23:07.820 --> 23:10.657
And he's at Walter Reed?

23:10.690 --> 23:11.758
Yes.

23:13.192 --> 23:15.562
And you what?

23:15.595 --> 23:18.531
You got some pictures
taken with him?

23:18.565 --> 23:19.866
What?

23:19.899 --> 23:21.434
Well, you... you had some

23:21.468 --> 23:22.802
nice photos taken with him?

23:22.835 --> 23:25.705
Him smiling, you smiling.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.206
You save him, and he'll hug you,

23:27.239 --> 23:28.741
and there'll be more photos.

23:28.775 --> 23:30.610
You'll save him from
the big bad Republicans?

23:30.643 --> 23:31.644
My God, not everything

23:31.678 --> 23:32.912
is about politics, Red.
(snorts)

23:32.945 --> 23:34.213
Come on, even you

23:34.246 --> 23:35.748
don't believe that.

23:35.782 --> 23:37.650
Here,
take your sweet little photo

23:37.684 --> 23:39.051
to Comrade Pollack

23:39.085 --> 23:40.720
and get her to agree

23:40.753 --> 23:42.889
to naming the stand
Ronald Reagan.

23:42.922 --> 23:43.923
See what traction

23:43.956 --> 23:44.924
you get there.

23:44.957 --> 23:46.626
Oh, I see.

23:46.659 --> 23:48.160
You want to delay the vote
on clinical trials

23:48.194 --> 23:49.929
because you know it'll win,

23:49.962 --> 23:52.198
and I'll get credit
for saving a young man?!

23:52.231 --> 23:54.867
Come on, don't act outraged.

23:54.901 --> 23:56.536
You're looking at the presidency

23:56.569 --> 23:57.670
in 2020.

23:57.704 --> 23:59.038
This fits right
into your strategy.

24:00.072 --> 24:02.475
"Boo-hoo, he saved my daddy.

24:02.509 --> 24:03.943
He deserves your vote."

24:03.976 --> 24:07.079
Come on,
you don't like children.

24:07.113 --> 24:10.550
No one likes children.

24:15.054 --> 24:17.056
(grunting)

24:18.124 --> 24:19.759
Hey.

24:19.792 --> 24:22.562
(phone buzzing)

24:22.595 --> 24:23.930
Yeah, it's me.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.197
Who?

24:25.231 --> 24:26.633
Oh, yeah, right.

24:26.666 --> 24:28.635
Uh, so, how crazy is it?

24:28.668 --> 24:30.637
Not too much crazy.

24:30.670 --> 24:32.739
Maybe a little crazy.

24:32.772 --> 24:33.940
They're on to something.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.675
I don't know what yet.

24:35.708 --> 24:38.545
We're discussing eradication,
but it won't embarrass you.

24:38.578 --> 24:40.980
I'll send you something
to validate.

24:44.050 --> 24:46.786
You want to eradicate
this new bug,

24:46.819 --> 24:48.955
you have to figure out
how and where it reproduces.

24:48.988 --> 24:49.956
The Mall?

24:49.989 --> 24:51.724
ALAIMO:
Yes.

24:51.758 --> 24:52.992
Then you have to figure out

24:53.025 --> 24:53.993
how they communicate.

24:54.026 --> 24:55.227
Is it tactile,

24:55.261 --> 24:56.663
chemical, acoustical?

24:56.696 --> 24:58.731
If it's a screwworm,

24:58.765 --> 25:00.700
perhaps pheromones...

25:00.733 --> 25:02.769
but it's not a screwworm.

25:02.802 --> 25:04.571
And how do we do that?

25:04.604 --> 25:05.905
How do we figure out
how it communicates?

25:05.938 --> 25:07.607
Go to the clusters.

25:07.640 --> 25:08.240
Ow.

25:08.274 --> 25:09.942
Here,

25:09.976 --> 25:11.210
the Mall,

25:11.243 --> 25:12.211
and here,

25:12.244 --> 25:13.846
near the Capitol.

25:18.184 --> 25:19.919
ANTHONY:
I'm sorry, Laurel.

25:19.952 --> 25:21.320
For...?

25:21.353 --> 25:22.655
Last night.

25:22.689 --> 25:23.656
What happened.

25:23.690 --> 25:25.157
I-I should've told you.

25:26.793 --> 25:28.628
I have a drinking problem.

25:29.662 --> 25:30.863
That's why I didn't want

25:30.897 --> 25:32.699
to drink last night
with you.

25:33.966 --> 25:36.903
But you drank
before at the bar.

25:36.936 --> 25:38.237
And I shouldn't have.

25:38.270 --> 25:39.606
I was happy.

25:39.639 --> 25:42.074
But last night I hit bottom.

25:42.108 --> 25:45.878
I-I just blacked out,
woke up with food in my ears.

25:47.313 --> 25:49.782
I don't even know what
I drank, but it knocked

25:49.816 --> 25:51.183
the hell out of me.

25:51.217 --> 25:53.753
I-If I were you...

25:53.786 --> 25:55.822
I wouldn't want to talk to me,
either, but...

25:55.855 --> 25:58.791
I'm going back to AA.

25:58.825 --> 26:01.260
I just wanted to tell you.

26:01.293 --> 26:04.731
There was someone last night
outside your door.

26:04.764 --> 26:05.932
A woman.

26:05.965 --> 26:09.736
Oh... Jennifer.

26:09.769 --> 26:11.904
Uh...
(chuckles)

26:11.938 --> 26:15.908
I was in a serious relationship
with her when we met,

26:15.942 --> 26:18.177
but the other night with you
changed everything.

26:18.210 --> 26:21.614
I-I knew I had
to end it with her before

26:21.648 --> 26:22.815
we went any further.

26:22.849 --> 26:23.916
Tha-That's why I said
that stuff about

26:23.950 --> 26:26.886
going slow.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.388
Can I take you out tonight?

26:29.421 --> 26:30.623
Just a friendly date.

26:30.657 --> 26:31.924
I-I owe you a dinner anyway,

26:31.958 --> 26:34.661
one that doesn't end up
in my ears.

26:34.694 --> 26:35.895
Anthony.

26:35.928 --> 26:36.763
Uh-oh.

26:36.796 --> 26:38.798
No, just...

26:38.831 --> 26:40.900
I think we should stay friends.

26:40.933 --> 26:42.735
See how it goes.
Okay?

26:42.769 --> 26:44.036
I guess I can't blame you.

26:44.070 --> 26:45.271
It's not...

26:50.877 --> 26:52.244
One second, Anthony.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.114
What the hell, Gustav?

26:55.147 --> 26:56.683
Uh, this isn't about you.

26:56.716 --> 26:57.950
You can't be following me.

26:57.984 --> 26:59.786
I'm not.
I was here first.

26:59.819 --> 27:01.420
This is
an infection cluster here.

27:01.453 --> 27:02.855
The entomologist sent us.

27:02.889 --> 27:03.890
Are you recording us?

27:03.923 --> 27:05.825
No, I'm monitoring
pheromones.

27:05.858 --> 27:07.727
It's a possible way
the bugs are communicating.

27:07.760 --> 27:09.696
I adapted this app
to test for pheromones...

27:09.729 --> 27:11.764
(high-pitched squeal)
Okay, I need my life
to be normal again.

27:11.798 --> 27:12.765
Shh.

27:12.799 --> 27:13.866
(high-pitched squealing)

27:17.937 --> 27:19.706
(mumbles)

27:19.739 --> 27:21.674
(door closes)
What if it communicates

27:21.708 --> 27:23.042
through high-pitched frequencies

27:23.075 --> 27:24.343
undetectable to humans?

27:24.376 --> 27:26.245
What if?
What is a "what if"?

27:26.278 --> 27:27.847
I saw a guy with a hearing aid

27:27.880 --> 27:30.683
walk past an infected person,
and it screeched.

27:30.717 --> 27:32.384
I mean, the hearing aid,
it screeched.

27:32.418 --> 27:34.186
That could be anything.

27:34.220 --> 27:35.922
Or...
Could be
a bad battery.

27:35.955 --> 27:38.190
Or the frequency
from this hybrid bug

27:38.224 --> 27:39.358
was causing feedback.

27:39.391 --> 27:40.727
Is that even possible?

27:40.760 --> 27:42.895
(sighs)

27:42.929 --> 27:45.932
The Galleria mellonella,
the greater wax moth,

27:45.965 --> 27:47.433
it can sense sound

27:47.466 --> 27:49.201
up to 300 kilohertz,

27:49.235 --> 27:51.971
about 150 times
higher than humans.

27:52.004 --> 27:53.840
But it's highly unusual.

27:53.873 --> 27:55.041
Where are you going?

27:55.074 --> 27:57.209
I-I wasn't finished.
I have an app

27:57.243 --> 27:59.879
which detects and disrupts
high frequency vibrations.

27:59.912 --> 28:01.948
I'm-I'm going to the Mall
to try it.
Wait.

28:01.981 --> 28:04.016
I'll go, too.

28:08.988 --> 28:10.990
Great to see you
again, Polly.

28:12.324 --> 28:13.893
You look taller now.

28:13.926 --> 28:15.795
I am taller now.

28:15.828 --> 28:16.863
That's what happens
when you're the whip.

28:16.896 --> 28:17.997
You gain three inches.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.431
Just in height?

28:19.465 --> 28:20.933
(chuckles)

28:20.967 --> 28:23.803
Do you miss the D.A.'s office?
Do you?

28:23.836 --> 28:26.806
I loved the drinks at 6:00.

28:26.839 --> 28:28.007
I like the CDC better.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.008
It's quieter.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.743
Okay.

28:30.777 --> 28:32.044
That's a good segue.

28:32.078 --> 28:33.980
(both laugh)
So...

28:34.013 --> 28:35.748
let's talk about
these strokes, these...

28:35.782 --> 28:39.485
CHIs. In the labs they're
calling them "head pops."

28:39.518 --> 28:40.987
How sensitive.

28:41.020 --> 28:42.889
(laughs)

28:42.922 --> 28:45.324
It-It's not about blood pressure
medicine, you know that?

28:45.357 --> 28:46.392
No, I didn't know that.

28:46.425 --> 28:47.894
What is it about?

28:49.395 --> 28:50.496
Bugs.

28:50.529 --> 28:51.898
Bugs?

28:52.331 --> 28:53.766
Like NSA bugs?

28:53.800 --> 28:55.201
Insect bugs.

29:01.273 --> 29:03.843
So, what kind of bugs?

29:03.876 --> 29:07.079
Oh, they're highly invasive,
and they cause...

29:07.113 --> 29:08.815
(moans)

29:08.848 --> 29:11.050
...personality changes.

29:11.083 --> 29:14.286
Their Latin name is something
something hominivorax,

29:14.320 --> 29:16.823
which means "eater of man."

29:16.856 --> 29:18.490
Really?

29:18.524 --> 29:20.960
Eater of man?

29:20.993 --> 29:23.129
Tell me more.

29:23.162 --> 29:25.965
Oh, I have
a CAT scan of one.

29:25.998 --> 29:27.433
POLLY:
Can you give me the MRI?

29:27.466 --> 29:29.468
CAT scan.

29:29.501 --> 29:30.569
Sure.

29:30.602 --> 29:32.805
(phone buzzing)

29:33.605 --> 29:35.174
Mm, who's that?

29:39.145 --> 29:40.479
Shh.

29:40.512 --> 29:41.513
Hey.

29:41.547 --> 29:43.015
How's it going, hon?

29:43.049 --> 29:45.051
Oh, come on, seriously.

29:45.084 --> 29:48.020
Yeah, just, uh, finishing up
a few things.

29:48.054 --> 29:50.890
I ordered in, how about you?

29:50.923 --> 29:54.193
Eh, you know, let me call you
back in five minutes.

29:54.226 --> 29:56.328
Uh, I love you, too.

29:58.497 --> 29:59.899
Five minutes, huh?

29:59.932 --> 30:00.967
That's all I get?

30:01.000 --> 30:02.334
That wasn't funny.

30:02.368 --> 30:04.503
I'm sorry.

30:04.536 --> 30:07.339
I'm so bad.

30:07.373 --> 30:11.110
Maybe you need to punish me.

30:18.918 --> 30:20.352
What have you found?

30:20.386 --> 30:22.288
I don't know what
I'm looking for.

30:22.321 --> 30:26.592
Frequency spikes
of 300 kilohertz or more.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.029
(grunts)

30:30.062 --> 30:31.998
Nope, nothing.

30:32.031 --> 30:34.000
This where your friend
got sick?

30:34.033 --> 30:35.067
Yes.

30:36.402 --> 30:38.504
(sighs)
We must come back

30:38.537 --> 30:40.006
in the morning.
It's too dark.

30:40.039 --> 30:41.073
Just a few more minutes.

30:41.107 --> 30:42.574
No.

30:42.608 --> 30:43.609
Time to go.

30:47.179 --> 30:48.414
Tomorrow then?

30:48.447 --> 30:50.316
Tomorrow.
Whatever's here

30:50.349 --> 30:52.184
isn't going away.

31:06.232 --> 31:09.635
Excuse me, I...
I had a talk with Red.

31:09.668 --> 31:11.603
He wants to avoid a vote
on clinical trials

31:11.637 --> 31:14.040
because he knows
it will win.
Yeah.

31:16.642 --> 31:19.011
(chuckles)

31:24.516 --> 31:26.285
What the hell are you doing?

31:26.318 --> 31:27.353
What am I doing?

31:27.386 --> 31:28.420
Yes.

31:28.454 --> 31:30.422
Stop talking about bugs.

31:30.456 --> 31:33.359
Wait, I don't understand, Dad.
H-How did you...

31:33.392 --> 31:34.626
Where-Where's
this coming from?
You talked to the CDC,

31:34.660 --> 31:37.229
saying that bugs are
crawling in people's heads

31:37.263 --> 31:38.630
and making them
explode, right?

31:38.664 --> 31:41.600
No, I said they
should look into it.

31:41.633 --> 31:42.969
Oh, my God.

31:43.002 --> 31:44.436
Luke, you can't do that.

31:44.470 --> 31:46.973
No one gives a rat's ass
about sexual indiscretion.

31:47.006 --> 31:48.174
The only thing
that can kill

31:48.207 --> 31:50.309
a political career
is ridicule.

31:50.342 --> 31:51.543
So knock it off.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.312
Now, how did you know
what I said to...

31:53.345 --> 31:55.214
Some CDC lawyer's out there,

31:55.247 --> 31:57.416
saying all you could talk
about was bugs.

31:57.449 --> 31:58.384
Damn it.

31:58.417 --> 31:59.418
Get me the number

31:59.451 --> 32:00.552
for Polly Savident
at the CDC.

32:00.586 --> 32:02.621
Right now.
Son, you can't
talk to her.

32:02.654 --> 32:05.357
It'll only make things worse.

32:05.391 --> 32:06.358
She's out to hurt you.

32:06.392 --> 32:07.459
So, what do I do?

32:07.493 --> 32:09.395
Say it's a lie.

32:09.428 --> 32:10.562
Say you were
misunderstood.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.264
Oh, stupid.

32:12.298 --> 32:13.299
I was stupid.

32:13.332 --> 32:14.433
Where's all this bug stuff

32:14.466 --> 32:15.534
coming from, anyway?

32:15.567 --> 32:18.437
When did you start
worrying about bugs?

32:18.470 --> 32:19.571
Okay, forget it.

32:19.605 --> 32:22.374
Uh, where are you
on Veterans Affairs?

32:22.408 --> 32:23.442
Stuck.

32:23.475 --> 32:25.744
Okay, I've been thinking,

32:25.777 --> 32:30.116
it's just as good if the
Republicans let him die.

32:30.149 --> 32:31.417
You did everything
you could.

32:31.450 --> 32:34.286
Republican intransigence
resulted

32:34.320 --> 32:35.387
in a good man's death,

32:35.421 --> 32:36.722
but you fought for him.

32:36.755 --> 32:38.490
It's a theme
for a presidential run.

32:38.524 --> 32:40.993
Republican brinksmanship
versus a good man

32:41.027 --> 32:42.461
who wants to get things done.

32:44.496 --> 32:46.165
Where you going?

32:46.198 --> 32:47.366
Not-not to the CDC lawyer.

32:47.399 --> 32:48.467
It's over.

32:59.478 --> 33:00.579
How is he?

33:00.612 --> 33:02.448
Not good,
but he's awake.

33:02.481 --> 33:04.483
You know my sister, right?

33:07.586 --> 33:10.256
Hello, Lance Corporal.

33:10.289 --> 33:11.423
Senator.

33:11.457 --> 33:13.025
My new best friend.

33:13.059 --> 33:15.327
No, but I do have
another new best friend.

33:15.361 --> 33:17.496
Senator Wheatus.

33:17.529 --> 33:19.065
Hey, Brett.

33:19.098 --> 33:20.066
How are you, buddy?

33:20.099 --> 33:21.767
Dying.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.369
Well...

33:23.402 --> 33:24.570
let's see if there's something

33:24.603 --> 33:26.438
we can do about that.

33:26.472 --> 33:29.375
Are you... are you up
for a photo?

33:29.408 --> 33:31.110
Whatever you need, sir.

33:31.143 --> 33:32.444
All right.

33:34.546 --> 33:35.514
How's the light there?

33:35.547 --> 33:37.549
(camera shutter clicking)

33:39.418 --> 33:40.486
You're letting Red
take the credit?

33:40.519 --> 33:41.487
We were deadlocked.

33:41.520 --> 33:42.454
I'm breaking the deadlock.

33:45.591 --> 33:47.459
Boom.

33:47.493 --> 33:50.496
Laurel, I'm gonna ask you
a favor right now.

33:50.529 --> 33:51.563
It's gonna start as a favor

33:51.597 --> 33:53.299
and then it's gonna
become a demand.

33:53.332 --> 33:54.466
A demand?

33:54.500 --> 33:56.468
Yes, as your boss,
your employer.

33:56.502 --> 33:58.704
Stop with the bug talk.

33:58.737 --> 34:01.107
I don't understand.

34:01.140 --> 34:03.275
All right,
so let me be clear.

34:03.309 --> 34:06.312
Don't ever mention bugs
to me again. Ever.

34:06.345 --> 34:08.380
What? Didn't you talk
to the entomologist?

34:08.414 --> 34:10.516
Rochelle said she
was on our side.
No.

34:10.549 --> 34:11.517
She called this morning.

34:11.550 --> 34:12.451
She said you're all crazy.

34:12.484 --> 34:14.186
So stop it.

34:14.220 --> 34:15.354
Never again.

34:15.387 --> 34:17.523
Okay?

34:21.660 --> 34:23.429
Okay, let's get that thumb

34:23.462 --> 34:25.197
up there a little higher,
okay, buddy?

34:26.232 --> 34:28.600
Dr. Alaimo.

34:31.470 --> 34:32.738
Dr. Alaimo?

34:32.771 --> 34:34.673
What happened?

34:34.706 --> 34:36.208
I don't understand.

34:36.242 --> 34:39.345
You told Senator Healy
we were crazy,

34:39.378 --> 34:41.380
but yesterday
you thought an infestation

34:41.413 --> 34:42.381
made sense.

34:42.414 --> 34:44.216
Yes, but that was yesterday.

34:44.250 --> 34:46.118
It's not today.

34:46.152 --> 34:47.386
What changed?

34:47.419 --> 34:48.454
She did.

34:48.487 --> 34:50.456
(laughing):
I don't...

34:50.489 --> 34:51.457
What?

34:51.490 --> 34:53.292
Shh.

34:54.893 --> 34:56.662
(whispering):
Can you hear me, Doctor?

34:58.530 --> 35:00.666
You're deaf in that ear,
aren't you?

35:00.699 --> 35:02.634
I think it's time for you to go.

35:02.668 --> 35:04.470
You found some bugs last night?

35:04.503 --> 35:06.305
No.

35:06.338 --> 35:07.873
I got a good night's sleep,

35:07.906 --> 35:10.309
that's all.

35:10.342 --> 35:12.311
("Jisas, Masta Mi Save" plays)

35:16.448 --> 35:18.450
(knocking at door)

35:21.953 --> 35:23.789
Now, before you say,
"I didn't order any pizza,"

35:23.822 --> 35:27.293
let me just say,
this is an apology pizza.

35:27.326 --> 35:28.627
Pineapple.

35:28.660 --> 35:31.397
And this...

35:31.430 --> 35:35.334
is Love Actually,
the best movie ever made.

35:35.367 --> 35:37.203
These are apology flowers.

35:37.236 --> 35:39.371
Anthony...
No, it's not
boyfriend stuff.

35:39.405 --> 35:41.407
It's the 12 steps.

35:41.440 --> 35:45.311
"Make direct amends to people
I've harmed."

35:45.344 --> 35:47.313
I harmed you.

35:47.346 --> 35:49.615
Pizza's extra.

35:52.251 --> 35:54.186
("Jump (for My Love)"
by The Pointer Sisters plays)

35:54.220 --> 35:55.421
ANTHONY:
This is my favorite part,
Hugh Grant dancing.

35:55.454 --> 35:56.422
You seen it?

35:56.455 --> 35:58.424
Uh-huh.

35:58.457 --> 36:00.692
I just... I never
get bored with it.

36:00.726 --> 36:02.428
(Anthony laughs)

36:02.461 --> 36:04.463
Anthony.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.298
Yeah?

36:06.332 --> 36:07.833
We're just friends, right?

36:07.866 --> 36:08.834
Yeah.

36:08.867 --> 36:10.702
How's your pizza?

36:10.736 --> 36:13.239
Ah, see,
not heated up enough.

36:13.272 --> 36:15.541
I'll do it.

36:15.574 --> 36:17.843
* Hold me

36:17.876 --> 36:20.512
* I'll give you all
that you need *

36:20.546 --> 36:22.448
(phone buzzing)

36:22.481 --> 36:25.384
* Wrap your love around me...

36:25.417 --> 36:26.418
What?

36:26.452 --> 36:27.586
* Feel you getting hotter

36:27.619 --> 36:29.455
* Oh, baby

36:29.488 --> 36:32.458
* I'll take you down,
I'll take you down *

36:32.491 --> 36:34.293
Anthony.

36:34.326 --> 36:36.262
* Where no one's ever
gone before... *

36:36.295 --> 36:37.963
Anthon-- Anthony!

36:37.996 --> 36:39.531
* And if you want more
Get off, get off...

36:39.565 --> 36:41.433
* If you want more...

36:41.467 --> 36:42.368
Get off.

36:42.401 --> 36:43.902
(muffled screaming)

36:43.935 --> 36:46.972
* Then jump for my love...

36:47.005 --> 36:48.440
Get off!

36:48.474 --> 36:50.609
Why can't we be friends?

36:50.642 --> 36:52.511
Why are you doing this?
Why...

36:52.544 --> 36:54.580
(grunts)

36:54.613 --> 36:56.248
* Jump, jump for my love...

36:56.282 --> 36:58.250
Ow.

36:58.284 --> 36:59.551
Aah!

36:59.585 --> 37:00.652
This is hurting.

37:00.686 --> 37:01.953
Oh!

37:01.987 --> 37:03.555
Laurel, you're hurting me.

37:03.589 --> 37:05.524
Get out of my apartment
right now or I'll kill you.

37:05.557 --> 37:07.993
You don't want to kill me, I...

37:08.026 --> 37:09.661
Get out!

37:09.695 --> 37:11.630
I wanted to be your friend.

37:11.663 --> 37:12.698
I...

37:19.538 --> 37:21.407
* You told me.

37:23.942 --> 37:25.944
(heavy breathing)

37:46.465 --> 37:48.500
(applause)
You know, people say
that we in Washington

37:48.534 --> 37:51.002
are incapable
of working together.

37:51.036 --> 37:54.673
Well, this great occasion
proves them wrong.

37:54.706 --> 37:58.009
For today, we are announcing
the restoration

37:58.043 --> 38:02.080
of an important program
to serve our brave warriors.

38:02.113 --> 38:03.449
Brett,

38:03.482 --> 38:06.452
I want to thank you
for your service.

38:06.485 --> 38:07.953
Your country has your back.

38:07.986 --> 38:10.021
Thank you, sir.

38:10.055 --> 38:11.490
Thank you for all
you've done for me

38:11.523 --> 38:12.958
and for all of us.

38:12.991 --> 38:13.959
(applause)

38:13.992 --> 38:14.960
I can't believe this.

38:14.993 --> 38:17.028
You just handed it to him.

38:17.062 --> 38:18.564
Is this Laurel's doing?

38:18.597 --> 38:19.498
What?

38:19.531 --> 38:21.867
No, Dad, just let it go.

38:21.900 --> 38:23.902
(applause)

38:25.504 --> 38:27.539
What have I always said?

38:27.573 --> 38:29.641
Don't be tempted
by the small moves.

38:29.675 --> 38:32.544
This is a small move
you're gonna regret.

38:32.578 --> 38:34.045
Red will have more power

38:34.079 --> 38:36.515
and he'll just hurt
the next Brett.

38:38.517 --> 38:40.519
(ringtone playing,
phone buzzing)

38:45.657 --> 38:46.692
Hello.

38:46.725 --> 38:48.794
Oh, hey.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.896
I thought
you were screening calls.

38:50.929 --> 38:53.499
I just wanted to say I...

38:53.532 --> 38:56.034
think your brother was pretty
cool for doing what he did.

38:57.403 --> 38:58.804
What did he do?

38:58.837 --> 39:00.639
He let my boss take the credit.

39:01.507 --> 39:03.409
For the clinical trials.

39:03.442 --> 39:05.577
Yeah, he can be good sometimes.

39:05.611 --> 39:06.645
And, hey,

39:06.678 --> 39:08.079
about Anthony,

39:08.113 --> 39:09.481
I-I've been a bit of a jerk.

39:09.515 --> 39:11.583
No, you haven't.

39:11.617 --> 39:12.818
Yes, I have.

39:12.851 --> 39:15.954
Gareth, seriously...
you haven't.

39:15.987 --> 39:17.956
Okay, I haven't.

39:17.989 --> 39:19.991
(knocking at door)

39:21.693 --> 39:23.895
Gareth, can you hang on
a second?

39:23.929 --> 39:25.130
Sure, hey, what is it?

39:25.163 --> 39:27.733
There's someone at my door.

39:27.766 --> 39:28.834
Who is it?

39:28.867 --> 39:29.901
It's me.

39:29.935 --> 39:32.103
(sighs)

39:32.137 --> 39:34.139
Gareth, I'll call you back.

39:34.172 --> 39:35.541
Hey, you all right?

39:35.574 --> 39:36.975
I am.

39:37.008 --> 39:38.644
I'll talk to you.

39:38.677 --> 39:41.580
Okay, I have a quick thing.

39:45.050 --> 39:46.918
Thank you for
the brass knuckles.

39:46.952 --> 39:48.920
Oh.

39:48.954 --> 39:50.689
You're welcome.

39:50.722 --> 39:52.491
I have something else, too.

39:52.524 --> 39:53.525
(groans)

39:54.660 --> 39:55.861
Mosquito netting.

39:55.894 --> 39:58.630
Thanks, but I don't think...

39:58.664 --> 40:01.667
actually, no, good, thanks.

40:01.700 --> 40:02.968
You have something else, too.

40:03.001 --> 40:04.636
Coasters and tape.

40:05.671 --> 40:08.039
Put this over your ears.

40:10.008 --> 40:11.142
What's that?

40:11.176 --> 40:12.644
Flowers.
I'm throwing them out.

40:12.678 --> 40:13.645
Why?

40:13.679 --> 40:14.846
Anthony bought them.

40:14.880 --> 40:16.014
Oh, good.

40:16.047 --> 40:17.048
You going to bed?

40:17.082 --> 40:18.550
I think so.

40:18.584 --> 40:20.652
Want me to put
this over your bed?

40:20.686 --> 40:22.488
No, that's okay, I'll do it.

40:22.521 --> 40:23.589
Okay.

40:23.622 --> 40:25.123
Promise, though.
I will.

40:25.156 --> 40:27.959
And, uh...

40:27.993 --> 40:30.562
put these over your ears.

40:30.596 --> 40:32.664
Got it.

40:32.698 --> 40:34.700
(door closes)

40:53.084 --> 40:55.086
*

41:12.538 --> 41:14.540
*

41:28.286 --> 41:29.955
(sighs)

41:43.134 --> 41:45.136
(sighs deeply)

41:58.216 --> 42:00.218

42:06.725 --> 42:07.959
(crackling)

42:15.767 --> 42:17.135

42:20.338 --> 42:22.941
(high-pitched squealing)

42:25.844 --> 42:27.245
Oh, no.

42:29.147 --> 42:31.316
(phone buzzing)

42:46.865 --> 42:48.767
LAUREL:
Please leave a message
after the beep.

42:48.800 --> 42:50.802
Laurel,
it's the cherry blossoms.

42:50.836 --> 42:52.103
Get them out now!

42:52.137 --> 42:53.338
That's why he brought you
the flowers!
