00:08.009 --> 00:09.760
<i>Previously on</i> Agent Carter...

00:09.844 --> 00:12.179
<i>This covers your activities
in June, 1944.</i>

00:12.263 --> 00:13.347
<i>I was in the war,
same as you.</i>

00:13.431 --> 00:14.515
If you want to compare war crimes,

00:14.598 --> 00:15.933
yours are a lot worse.

00:16.017 --> 00:17.393
Unbelievable.

00:17.601 --> 00:19.520
- You have any idea what could do that?
- Zero Matter.

00:19.645 --> 00:22.106
- Here's my business card.
- Thank you, Dr Wilkes.

00:22.857 --> 00:25.067
I want to thank you
properly for saving my life.

00:25.151 --> 00:26.277
How about dinner and dancing?

00:26.444 --> 00:28.154
Now hand it over.

00:30.156 --> 00:32.199
<i>He's a good man who's
in over his head because of me.</i>

00:32.324 --> 00:33.617
<i>He deserves a better fate than this.</i>

00:33.701 --> 00:35.619
<i>He's infected with Zero Matter.
He's confused.</i>

00:35.745 --> 00:37.496
- He was gonna shoot you.
- Yes, he was.

00:37.580 --> 00:38.873
And I was supposed to
just let it happen?

00:38.998 --> 00:41.417
You said you moved here
because you wanted a fresh start,

00:41.500 --> 00:43.961
but that's not the whole truth.
I think you're in love with Peggy.

00:44.211 --> 00:46.297
Vernon sabotaged us.
He's setting up Chief Thompson.

00:46.422 --> 00:47.673
- He's figured out our plan.
- What plan?

00:47.757 --> 00:49.467
Turning the gamma cannon
into a bomb.

00:49.592 --> 00:51.302
- When will the bomb go off?
- It's on a remote trigger.

00:51.385 --> 00:52.470
Thompson will blow it once he's clear.

00:52.553 --> 00:53.846
<i>I knew Jack was
up to something.</i>

00:53.929 --> 00:55.556
<i>- He's gonna kill them all.</i>
<i>- Including Dr Wilkes.</i>

00:55.681 --> 00:56.849
I'm going in to retrieve Wilkes.

00:56.932 --> 00:58.267
If the bomb goes off,
you'll be dead, too.

00:58.350 --> 00:59.393
We're out of time.

00:59.477 --> 01:00.811
Peggy?
What are you doing?

01:00.936 --> 01:02.980
Getting you out of here.
Jason, open this door.

01:03.147 --> 01:04.482
I'm ready for this to be over. Go.

01:04.607 --> 01:05.941
Whatever you did
to the detonator, undo it.

01:06.025 --> 01:07.818
They got you, too, bitch.

01:08.652 --> 01:10.071
No, Dr Wilkes, you can't...

01:26.462 --> 01:27.880
Fix it.

01:27.963 --> 01:29.090
- No!
- No!

01:31.050 --> 01:32.593
Fixed.

01:37.932 --> 01:39.308
Put it down.

01:39.517 --> 01:41.227
What? You're gonna shoot me, Carter?

01:41.393 --> 01:43.395
- Listen to her, Jack.
- You won't.

01:43.896 --> 01:45.022
You can't.

01:45.189 --> 01:46.607
You don't have it in you.

01:47.566 --> 01:49.318
There was a time when that was true.

01:51.070 --> 01:52.530
Not any more.

01:55.825 --> 01:57.368
Put the detonator down, Jack.

02:01.872 --> 02:03.415
Sorry, Carter.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.085
Got to do it.

02:14.677 --> 02:16.053
Wasn't me.

02:16.762 --> 02:18.139
It's still armed.

02:24.687 --> 02:26.647
Watch your step.
There's Zero Matter on the floor.

02:26.981 --> 02:28.732
I see some here, too.

02:30.067 --> 02:32.736
Whatever went off,
it definitely wasn't the Gamma Cannon.

02:33.529 --> 02:35.114
It's still here
and in pretty good shape, too.

02:37.283 --> 02:38.325
Any sign of Vernon?

02:38.409 --> 02:39.660
Could be anywhere in this mess.

02:39.869 --> 02:42.204
- There's more Zero Matter here.
- Must have come from Wilkes.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.124
Jason!

02:50.921 --> 02:52.923
Peggy, it's not safe. I'm...

02:53.007 --> 02:55.092
I think you're all right. How do you feel?

02:55.217 --> 02:57.678
Weak... Sore. I'm...

02:59.513 --> 03:01.557
The Zero Matter. It... It's gone.

03:02.099 --> 03:04.393
- I couldn't hold it any more.
- It seems you've expelled it.

03:05.060 --> 03:06.395
Can you move?

03:07.354 --> 03:08.564
Peggy?

03:09.690 --> 03:11.358
- Something's happening.
- What is it?

03:23.746 --> 03:25.456
We got a problem.

03:38.177 --> 03:39.386
There.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.098
Everything is where it belongs.

03:46.310 --> 03:48.437
Don't bother. Those won't stop her.

03:49.730 --> 03:50.856
We have to move.

03:50.981 --> 03:52.274
Now!

03:57.238 --> 03:58.989
- Where the hell's the car?
- Where the hell is Samberly?

03:59.073 --> 04:00.908
That's the $64 question.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.785
No offence, Sousa,
but next time I see that guy,

04:02.868 --> 04:05.162
- I'm gonna kill him!
- Just pick a direction and run!

04:07.748 --> 04:11.293
You can run if you want,
but why bother?

04:12.127 --> 04:13.754
I know where you're going,

04:13.837 --> 04:16.465
and it's only a matter
of time until I find you.

04:17.508 --> 04:19.426
You honestly thought that I...

04:24.515 --> 04:26.725
Jarvis, you just hit a woman
with my car!

04:27.059 --> 04:29.478
- I know, sir.
- She's a two-time Oscar nominee.

04:29.645 --> 04:31.981
Miss Frost is quite resilient.
She's fine. Trust me.

04:34.316 --> 04:35.901
Sorry! Got turned around!

04:35.985 --> 04:38.195
Everybody in the cars, please!
Quickly now!

05:03.470 --> 05:04.763
Come on.

05:04.847 --> 05:06.807
You know where
the holding cells are, Agent Harper.

05:09.101 --> 05:11.770
Vega's singing like a bird, giving up
every one of Vernon's buddies.

05:12.396 --> 05:14.648
- How hard you hit him?
- I didn't lay a hand on him.

05:15.441 --> 05:17.276
I guess my reputation precedes me.

05:18.319 --> 05:19.987
It was freezing.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.072
The type of cold that kills.

05:22.740 --> 05:25.868
And there was a blackness, a...
A dark beyond dark.

05:26.035 --> 05:28.245
I got to say, Doc,
that's a big disappointment.

05:28.746 --> 05:30.873
Crack opens up in the sky,
and it's a whole lot of nothing?

05:31.332 --> 05:32.666
It was more than nothing.

05:32.750 --> 05:35.377
It was Zero Matter
consuming everything,

05:35.794 --> 05:37.338
and it will move on to our world if

05:37.421 --> 05:39.173
Whitney Frost
has anything to do with it.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.091
What do you mean?

05:41.842 --> 05:44.261
It's like a disease... A cancer.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.305
Whitney and I were the carriers.

05:46.430 --> 05:48.766
It had consumed
everything it could on that side.

05:49.892 --> 05:51.560
Now it's looking
for a new place to infect.

05:52.478 --> 05:53.520
What's the verdict, Howard?

05:53.604 --> 05:54.980
You're a little anaemic,
Dr Wilkes.

05:55.314 --> 05:56.982
Other than that,
you're clean of Zero Matter.

05:59.526 --> 06:00.861
Congratulations.

06:01.195 --> 06:02.946
Seems you are officially
back to your old self.

06:03.322 --> 06:05.240
Thank you, Mr Jarvis. But...

06:06.575 --> 06:08.660
I don't know if I'll ever
be back to my old self.

06:11.580 --> 06:12.664
Things I've done...

06:13.749 --> 06:14.792
I threatened to kill you, Peggy.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.752
Don't get down on yourself, Dr Wilkes.

06:17.127 --> 06:18.629
Peggy's life's always
getting threatened.

06:21.673 --> 06:22.883
I'm just saying.

06:23.509 --> 06:25.594
Maybe the problem is you.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.324
It's beautiful.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.035
Hello, angel face.

06:54.331 --> 06:55.666
Wall's coming along.

06:56.250 --> 06:57.626
Very nice.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.670
Well, I'm gonna need some more paper.

07:00.129 --> 07:01.171
Yeah, sure.

07:02.172 --> 07:04.466
But first, how's about
we get you a bite to eat?

07:04.883 --> 07:05.968
No.

07:06.677 --> 07:08.554
No, I need to finish.

07:11.682 --> 07:13.475
And what are we working on today?

07:13.851 --> 07:15.727
I'm going to open a new door.

07:16.562 --> 07:19.189
And this time, it's gonna stay open.

07:20.899 --> 07:22.609
Well, that sounds
like a real nice shindig.

07:24.486 --> 07:26.321
How about we get some food in...

07:28.323 --> 07:30.159
Don't touch me while I'm working.

07:47.050 --> 07:48.760
I don't know
what to do, <i>Nonna.</i>

07:49.136 --> 07:53.223
When Whitney came back into my life,
it was like the sky opened up

07:54.349 --> 07:57.060
and I had my very own
ray of sunshine just...

07:58.395 --> 07:59.730
Beaming down on me.

08:01.773 --> 08:03.150
And now...

08:04.026 --> 08:05.944
- It's a ray of garbage.
- Hmm!

08:11.158 --> 08:13.410
I'm at my rope's end, <i>Nonna,</i>
the way she...

08:14.244 --> 08:15.746
Talked to me.

08:22.419 --> 08:24.087
Nah, it wasn't her.

08:24.713 --> 08:27.883
She's not acting like the girl I fell for.
Something's got ahold of her.

08:36.475 --> 08:37.976
With all my heart and soul.

08:50.656 --> 08:53.408
- Thanks again for letting me stay here.
- Think nothing of it, Doctor.

08:53.992 --> 08:56.036
Jarvis, we need mustard!

08:56.203 --> 08:57.996
- May I ask you a question?
- Shoot.

08:58.497 --> 09:00.290
Is there a portrait
of you in every bedroom?

09:00.749 --> 09:03.502
It's a collection. Every one is different.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.213
What?

09:06.421 --> 09:07.756
Art makes a house a home.

09:08.382 --> 09:09.675
I hope you're well-rested, Jason.

09:09.758 --> 09:11.635
Howard is going to need help
making a new Gamma Cannon.

09:11.802 --> 09:14.555
I've been thinking about that,
and I hate to be a naysayer, but...

09:14.721 --> 09:15.847
Nay?

09:16.265 --> 09:17.307
Let's say we're successful.

09:17.432 --> 09:20.018
We use the Gamma Cannon to separate
Whitney Frost from the Zero Matter.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.771
Then what? The Zero Matter
is still here, in the world.

09:22.980 --> 09:24.439
The man makes a good point, Peg.

09:25.107 --> 09:26.984
Why don't you whip up
a new containment unit?

09:27.317 --> 09:30.279
We can capture some of the Zero Matter
and safely study it in Stark Labs.

09:30.362 --> 09:32.155
That's the most ridiculous idea
I've ever heard in my life.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.448
I'm only trying to help.

09:33.532 --> 09:36.243
Yourself get custody of the Zero Matter
so you can make a profit on it.

09:36.368 --> 09:37.703
- That stings.
- You'll heal.

09:38.078 --> 09:42.040
Fine. Anyway,
we got a bigger problem on our hands.

09:42.833 --> 09:43.917
We're out of mustard.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.878
Jarvis, you cultivating seeds in there?

09:51.800 --> 09:55.053
Introducing Mr Joseph Manfredi
of the Yonkers Manfredis.

09:55.178 --> 09:57.723
I see a gun, this guy sees Heaven.

09:57.973 --> 09:59.891
Easy. Easy.

10:01.184 --> 10:03.061
Let him put the condiment down.

10:11.153 --> 10:12.571
Now you listen to me, Manfredi.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.240
You can't just walk into a man's home
and take his butler hostage.

10:15.365 --> 10:17.826
Oh, yeah? Well, you can't steal
my underwear.

10:18.994 --> 10:20.662
I told you then,
and I'm telling you now...

10:21.204 --> 10:23.248
You can't wear your skivvies
in a schwitz.

10:30.422 --> 10:31.673
Hey.

10:31.882 --> 10:33.759
Come here,
you handsome son of a bitch!

10:33.884 --> 10:35.844
Come here, you glorious kook!

10:37.429 --> 10:39.348
- You know Joe Manfredi?
- Yes, we do.

10:39.431 --> 10:41.058
Yes, this man kidnapped me.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.310
He strapped me down
so Whitney Frost could torture me

10:43.393 --> 10:45.228
and remove the Zero Matter
from my body.

10:45.812 --> 10:46.897
That was wrong.

10:47.230 --> 10:50.025
<i>Mea culpa,</i> Doc. <i>Mea culpa.</i>

10:52.736 --> 10:53.862
That's why I'm here.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.740
I think we all have something
in common.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.785
We're worried about Whitney.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.043
I mean, she's not herself.

11:08.377 --> 11:11.630
Normally, my Whitney
is a very thoughtful, loving person.

11:12.047 --> 11:13.298
Who you kidding, Joey?

11:13.507 --> 11:14.883
You always went for the crazy ones.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.468
Jenny Boccabella...

11:16.593 --> 11:18.470
She tried to throw you
off the 59th Street Bridge.

11:18.553 --> 11:21.014
Well, that was a... Unique situation.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.224
Oh, yeah.

11:22.432 --> 11:24.851
Mr Manfredi, what is it
that you think any of us can do for you?

11:26.937 --> 11:28.188
Save her.

11:28.605 --> 11:29.690
"Save her"?

11:29.856 --> 11:31.233
She'd kill us all if she could.

11:31.358 --> 11:34.611
Yeah, but that's not Whitney. That's the
stuff inside her. Doc, you know.

11:34.778 --> 11:36.947
You were in her shoes.
I mean, this stuff changes you.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.365
Whitney is no innocent.

11:38.824 --> 11:42.035
She's a willing accomplice
led by her own innate lust for power.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.620
Sure, but this is different, okay?

11:43.704 --> 11:45.872
She's holed up in her room,
she doesn't eat,

11:45.956 --> 11:48.166
she doesn't sleep,
she's writing on the walls...

11:48.250 --> 11:50.419
- Writing what?
- I don't know. Formulas or something.

11:50.627 --> 11:53.755
She keeps talking to herself about...
Opening the rift again.

11:54.172 --> 11:56.341
She can't.
The last of the Roxxon uranium

11:56.425 --> 11:58.510
was used up when she
detonated it in the desert.

11:58.677 --> 12:01.388
Unless she figured out a way to do it
without an atomic explosion.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.724
I wouldn't underestimate her genius.

12:04.474 --> 12:05.892
I can't lose her again.

12:07.436 --> 12:08.645
You got to stop her.

12:08.937 --> 12:10.814
No, we have to beat her to the punch.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.316
- What does that mean?
- If we're going to end this

12:13.400 --> 12:15.277
once and for all,
we need to open the rift,

12:15.360 --> 12:16.903
knock the Zero Matter out of Whitney,

12:16.987 --> 12:18.155
and send it back
to wherever it came from.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.406
It's not that easy.

12:19.614 --> 12:21.616
We have no real understanding
about how the rift works.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.410
Discovering it
in the first place was a fluke.

12:23.493 --> 12:26.288
You kids are so cute. I bet you cram
for your finals and everything.

12:26.455 --> 12:28.915
- What are you chattering about?
- The answer is right in front of you.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.918
How do the most successful
scientists achieve greatness?

12:32.961 --> 12:34.880
Given your history,
drinking copious amounts of alcohol

12:34.963 --> 12:36.047
and cavorting with loose women.

12:36.339 --> 12:37.841
That's a good guess, but it's wrong.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.677
Nope. They get smarter
people to do the research,

12:41.094 --> 12:42.471
and then they steal it themselves.

12:42.679 --> 12:44.639
Why don't we just take it
from her and be done with it?

12:44.890 --> 12:47.309
Well, that's impossible.
She never leaves that room.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.980
Then you'll have to give her a reason to.

12:56.693 --> 12:58.111
Sweetheart?

13:10.248 --> 13:12.083
- Whitney.
- Leave me alone.

13:13.418 --> 13:14.586
And over to that.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.755
But if you take it down there
and you divide it by that...

13:17.714 --> 13:18.840
I told you that.

13:20.550 --> 13:22.427
You know I wouldn't bother
you if it wasn't important.

13:22.636 --> 13:24.346
Nothing is as important as this.

13:25.722 --> 13:27.182
Not even me?

13:29.351 --> 13:31.102
I didn't say that.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.897
You know I've been trying
to help you any way I can, right?

13:34.564 --> 13:35.899
Now I need you to help me.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.067
What do you want?

13:37.150 --> 13:39.152
Trying to pound some information
out of one of my guys,

13:39.236 --> 13:40.612
but he's not scared of me.

13:42.572 --> 13:44.324
But if you were there...

13:45.283 --> 13:47.369
So you're saying you need
me to be your muscle?

13:48.161 --> 13:49.955
The most beautiful muscle there is.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.961
Let me finish this equation.

13:59.047 --> 14:00.590
I'll help you.

14:04.052 --> 14:05.554
Thanks, doll.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.446
- I don't understand, boss.
- No, don't worry about it.

14:23.822 --> 14:25.740
Just play along, okay?
I'll make it up to you.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.826
Have a seat.

14:29.786 --> 14:31.246
Have a seat!

14:35.250 --> 14:36.751
Now I'm gonna ask you a question,

14:37.627 --> 14:39.045
and I want you to be honest with me.

14:39.629 --> 14:41.298
Yeah, of course.

14:44.676 --> 14:47.470
How long have you been working
for Little Tommy Fontana?

14:49.514 --> 14:52.058
I don't work for Tommy. I work for you.

14:52.267 --> 14:54.269
You said you were gonna
be honest with me, Hank.

14:55.145 --> 14:57.480
- How long?
- Well, I... I'm telling you.

14:58.857 --> 15:00.150
I don't work for Tommy.

15:01.943 --> 15:04.988
Get up. Get up! Get up!

15:05.697 --> 15:07.407
Don't you lie to me, Hank!

15:07.741 --> 15:09.784
- I'm confused.
- Yeah, I'm confused, too

15:09.868 --> 15:11.411
because I thought we were friends.

15:11.536 --> 15:13.288
And now you run around
with Tommy's crew?

15:13.371 --> 15:15.999
No. You just tell me
what you want me to say.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.084
- No, I'm not gonna tell you.
- You tell me.

15:18.168 --> 15:21.129
Now, we can do this the easy way
or we could do it the hard way.

15:21.212 --> 15:23.256
- Am I right, sweetheart?
- Yes, dear.

15:27.177 --> 15:29.054
So, she's real crazy.

15:29.721 --> 15:31.848
- She's a genius.
- Can you decipher it?

15:32.223 --> 15:33.683
I don't speak megalomaniac.

15:34.017 --> 15:35.352
Fortunately, Howard Stark does.

15:36.478 --> 15:38.939
Work quickly. I doubt Mr Manfredi
can fool her for long.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.863
Hey, over here.

15:47.322 --> 15:48.365
What are you doing?

15:48.782 --> 15:51.242
Figured you'd want at least one
souvenir from your trip to California.

15:51.368 --> 15:53.078
It wasn't exactly
the trip I expected it to be.

15:53.495 --> 15:55.121
Definitely full of surprises.

15:56.414 --> 15:58.667
Still, glad we got to work together again.

16:12.973 --> 16:15.141
Get up, you piece of bologna!

16:15.225 --> 16:16.768
Stop falling out of the chair!

16:16.851 --> 16:21.564
I swear on the soul of my mother that
I am not working for Tommy Fontana!

16:21.648 --> 16:24.359
- You always hated your mother, Hank.
- So what?

16:24.609 --> 16:26.569
You seem to have this
all under control, Joe.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.947
- I am going back to work.
- Wait, wait, wait.

16:29.030 --> 16:31.574
- Just a couple of more minutes.
- No! You are wasting my time.

16:32.575 --> 16:34.953
Could you just... Do the thing?

16:36.287 --> 16:38.707
Just a little bit,
just to scare him, and then...

16:38.790 --> 16:40.458
Then you can go.

16:40.583 --> 16:41.751
Fine.

16:41.918 --> 16:44.796
Oh, please, look...
Look, I'm telling the truth!

16:45.088 --> 16:46.214
You're in for it now, Hank.

16:46.297 --> 16:49.592
No, no. All right, stop, stop, stop!
I'll tell you! I'll tell you!

16:49.676 --> 16:52.095
They came to me!
They threatened my family!

16:52.220 --> 16:53.513
- Who?
- The feds!

16:53.596 --> 16:54.973
The feds! Huh!

16:55.181 --> 16:57.183
I had to cooperate with them.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.854
I'm sorry, Joe. I'm so sorry.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.441
- I think I'm done here.
- What are you saying?

17:05.066 --> 17:06.693
What are you telling me, Hank? Oh!

17:07.485 --> 17:08.528
Now I'm gonna have to kill you.

17:08.611 --> 17:11.156
- Oh, no!
- Hey, Whitney! Whitney!

17:11.281 --> 17:13.283
Wait! Sit down.

17:18.872 --> 17:20.749
That's the last of it. Let's go.

17:20.832 --> 17:22.333
Whitney, come back here!
Stop!

17:22.584 --> 17:23.835
Window!

17:28.798 --> 17:30.633
- Daniel, hurry up!
- One second.

17:34.679 --> 17:36.056
That should slow her down a little.

17:49.861 --> 17:51.029
Wait.

17:53.073 --> 17:54.991
No more interruptions.

18:03.333 --> 18:05.460
I have to agree with Dr Samberly.
It's terrible.

18:05.543 --> 18:06.586
Thank you, sir.

18:06.669 --> 18:08.129
Have they determined
what Whitney's designed?

18:08.213 --> 18:10.215
Show of hands,
who here has invented a hover car?

18:11.049 --> 18:12.884
Nope? Nobody? I win.

18:13.051 --> 18:14.886
- It didn't even work!
- The second one did.

18:15.053 --> 18:17.263
As we suspected,
it's a machine that cuts a fissure

18:17.347 --> 18:19.557
between our world
and the Zero Matter dimension.

18:20.475 --> 18:22.519
The conversation has now
turned to naming rights.

18:24.104 --> 18:26.856
- Have you lot got nothing better to do?
- The Shears of God.

18:27.065 --> 18:28.149
It's a great name. Right, Jarvis?

18:28.358 --> 18:30.443
- Patently ridiculous, sir.
- Ah, who asked you?

18:30.527 --> 18:32.112
Gentlemen, will it work?

18:32.654 --> 18:33.947
It's incredibly complex.

18:34.364 --> 18:37.117
She is describing two different
four-dimensional space-times...

18:37.325 --> 18:39.828
One for our universe,
one for the Zero Matter world.

18:40.078 --> 18:42.664
This design is a machine
that connects the two.

18:43.331 --> 18:45.458
If she weren't a homicidal
maniac, I'd be in love.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.710
It'll work, but there are issues.

18:48.086 --> 18:51.214
For example, how do we prevent even
more Zero Matter from coming out?

18:51.381 --> 18:52.632
Not to mention the risk.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.301
If we lose control of it, we've only
succeeded in giving Whitney Frost

18:55.426 --> 18:56.928
the means to bring about
the end of the world.

18:57.095 --> 18:59.222
Well, I'd like to postpone
Armageddon if we can help it.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.809
Yes, there are many obstacles,

19:02.976 --> 19:06.354
but I'm standing in front of three
of the most radiant minds on the planet.

19:06.938 --> 19:08.439
Surely, you can find
a way to overcome them.

19:11.109 --> 19:13.486
I believe you can actually hear
the sound of their egos growing.

19:14.028 --> 19:16.990
What if we used gamma rays
to keep the Zero Matter contained?

19:17.157 --> 19:18.741
No, we already know it'll close the rift.

19:20.118 --> 19:21.661
What about
high-energy x-rays?

19:22.120 --> 19:25.373
I can construct projectors
that would throw x-rays at the rift,

19:25.665 --> 19:28.084
- keeping Zero Matter at bay.
- That's good. I like that.

19:28.376 --> 19:30.670
We'll need an isolated place to do this.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.840
Can't open a rift to another world
in the middle of downtown.

19:35.633 --> 19:38.094
The studio lot
at Stark Pictures is 180 acres.

19:38.303 --> 19:40.722
That's easy enough.
Just give everybody the day off.

19:40.972 --> 19:42.765
And I'll find a way
to draw Miss Frost out.

19:43.141 --> 19:45.894
- You won't have to.
- She'll feel it. Then she'll come.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.062
Wonderful.

19:48.229 --> 19:49.772
Oh, and it's called a rift generator.

19:52.942 --> 19:55.195
I like it.

19:55.320 --> 19:56.696
- I think it's great.
- It's good.

19:58.907 --> 19:59.949
How's that?

20:00.325 --> 20:01.743
Great work.

20:01.951 --> 20:03.411
From a lovely pair of hands.

20:05.121 --> 20:06.998
Mr Stark, don't kid.

20:07.498 --> 20:10.210
Mr Stark's my old man.
You can call me Howard.

20:11.794 --> 20:13.671
All right... Howard.

20:15.048 --> 20:16.799
- I can call you Howard, right?
- Nope.

20:18.301 --> 20:19.719
Your perfume is driving me mad.

20:19.969 --> 20:22.263
It's Rinso.

20:22.388 --> 20:23.681
Hmm.

20:24.015 --> 20:25.350
I've attached the forward converter.

20:25.642 --> 20:27.727
- What's next?
- Let's start on the regulator.

20:33.942 --> 20:36.611
Chief Sousa, I've been making
the rounds on my apology tour,

20:36.694 --> 20:38.863
- and I feel like I should...
- I don't need an apology, Doctor.

20:41.282 --> 20:43.910
- I do have a question, though.
- What's that?

20:45.119 --> 20:47.038
Why'd you hold the gun
on her and not on me?

20:50.959 --> 20:53.920
Deductive reasoning, Chief Sousa.
I knew you'd fold.

20:54.963 --> 20:56.589
Because I would've.

20:56.881 --> 20:58.132
What's next, Mr Jarvis?

20:58.633 --> 21:00.468
One vibration mount
for the generator.

21:01.844 --> 21:03.137
Ah, voltage regulators?

21:04.180 --> 21:05.431
Uh... as many as we've got.

21:06.641 --> 21:08.101
How is Ana feeling?

21:09.143 --> 21:10.520
Very well.

21:10.979 --> 21:13.606
Although she's climbing
the proverbial walls to be released.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.150
Doctor says she can come
home in a day or two.

21:16.276 --> 21:17.402
Well, that's good news.

21:21.239 --> 21:22.824
We had a good cry over
what can never be.

21:25.660 --> 21:29.038
She's her usual...
Optimistic, lovely self.

21:30.290 --> 21:31.916
And far stronger than I could ever be.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.419
You sell yourself short, Mr Jarvis.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.506
You may be the strongest of us all.

21:43.094 --> 21:46.806
Okay, look, I'm not a scientist,
but I'm here to help.

21:47.432 --> 21:50.059
How about collecting the dinner orders?

21:52.812 --> 21:54.147
You know what, Marge?

21:57.817 --> 21:58.985
I'm gonna do that for you.

22:00.695 --> 22:03.323
What do you guys want? Gotta be
good takeout someplace in this city.

22:03.948 --> 22:08.119
Four corned beef on rye, uh,
two egg salad on white, and...

22:08.995 --> 22:10.079
Ugh!

22:10.163 --> 22:11.831
One pickled-herring salad.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.169
Uh, yeah.

22:17.003 --> 22:19.589
Yeah, someone will come pick it up.
Thank you. Thanks.

22:24.302 --> 22:26.471
What'd you leave behind, Vernon?

23:06.844 --> 23:08.971
Thanks to Mr Stark's
contacts at the DWP,

23:09.097 --> 23:11.140
the rift generator
is hooked up and ready.

23:11.224 --> 23:12.392
The x-ray projectors are set.

23:12.517 --> 23:14.060
I'll run between them,
make sure they're functioning.

23:14.310 --> 23:16.396
Jarvis, Dr Wilkes, and I
will man the Gamma Cannon.

23:16.771 --> 23:18.689
Peggy, Jack, and I
will be on the lookout for Frost.

23:19.607 --> 23:20.733
All right, let's do this.

23:20.858 --> 23:22.902
Hold on. Safety meeting.

23:23.611 --> 23:24.821
From the Isodyne atomic tests,

23:24.904 --> 23:26.739
we know that moments
before the rift closes,

23:26.906 --> 23:30.243
anything within a certain radius will
levitate and instantly be drawn into it.

23:31.035 --> 23:32.662
For a rift this size,

23:32.829 --> 23:36.999
we've calculated that the no-go zone
to avoid being sucked in

23:37.083 --> 23:38.626
is 20 feet from the generator.

23:39.293 --> 23:40.878
Once that rift begins to close,

23:41.254 --> 23:43.089
you don't want to be
on the other side of this line.

23:43.965 --> 23:45.341
All right, I think we're ready.

23:45.842 --> 23:47.927
Let's see what she's got.

24:29.677 --> 24:30.970
Didn't compensate for the wind.

24:32.054 --> 24:34.098
Jarvis, set me up again.

24:36.142 --> 24:38.269
<i>Status check. Any sign
of Miss Frost, Howard?</i>

24:39.187 --> 24:40.229
All's quiet.

24:40.354 --> 24:42.732
Though some of us may need
to re-evaluate our priorities.

24:42.940 --> 24:44.650
You're absolutely right, Dr Wilkes.

24:45.276 --> 24:46.903
Nobody cares about the long game.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.157
Damn!

24:52.783 --> 24:54.243
What am I doing wrong, Jarvis?

24:55.828 --> 24:57.038
Sir...

24:57.788 --> 25:00.333
We are standing before
an incomprehensible rip

25:00.416 --> 25:02.043
in the fabric of our world.

25:03.753 --> 25:05.338
Use the 7-iron.

25:09.217 --> 25:11.344
- Dr Samberly, how are you fairing?
<i>- Not great.</i>

25:11.552 --> 25:14.055
<i>That pickled herring's
coming back on me in a big way.</i>

25:15.056 --> 25:17.141
- And the x-ray projectors?
<i>- One's giving me trouble.</i>

25:17.475 --> 25:18.809
Uh, stand by.

25:19.894 --> 25:22.647
- You sure she's coming?
- She'll come. I know it in my gut.

25:23.898 --> 25:25.441
And what's your gut telling
you about me?

25:26.150 --> 25:27.818
I'm just wondering how quick
I'm gonna have to clean out

25:27.902 --> 25:29.070
my office once we get back
to New York.

25:29.153 --> 25:30.196
What are you talking about?

25:30.279 --> 25:31.822
You turning me in
for siding with Vernon.

25:32.448 --> 25:34.033
What? I'm not doing that.

25:35.535 --> 25:37.537
I've been riding you
since you took this case,

25:37.620 --> 25:39.497
and you're telling me
you're just gonna let it slide?

25:39.872 --> 25:41.999
Well, I wouldn't say that.
Did threaten to shoot you.

25:42.250 --> 25:45.086
Yeah. I remember.

25:45.169 --> 25:46.379
It's not your fault entirely.

25:46.837 --> 25:49.632
Vernon Masters saw your boundless
ambition and took advantage of it.

25:50.591 --> 25:52.969
Don't get so sentimental. I might cry.

25:53.302 --> 25:56.514
You're a good man, Jack. I know that.

26:00.434 --> 26:01.936
I have something for you.

26:04.564 --> 26:05.815
I found this in Vernon's briefcase.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.775
The Arena Club pin.
I've seen them before.

26:07.858 --> 26:08.901
Hmm...

26:11.904 --> 26:13.573
It's also a key.

26:14.699 --> 26:16.242
A key to what?

26:17.118 --> 26:18.995
Guess we'll just have to figure that out.

26:21.414 --> 26:23.457
You weren't really gonna
shoot me, were you, Peggy?

26:24.542 --> 26:26.794
Just... Forget it.

26:27.837 --> 26:29.213
I don't want to know.

26:34.844 --> 26:36.679
Nice work, Aloysius.

26:47.064 --> 26:49.233
- Was that Samberly?
- Dr Samberly, are you all right?

26:51.152 --> 26:52.486
Samberly?

26:53.029 --> 26:54.530
Anybody got eyes on Samberly?

26:54.822 --> 26:56.991
No, but I got eyes on Whitney Frost
heading towards the rift.

26:57.074 --> 26:58.451
Everybody mobilise!

27:20.222 --> 27:21.724
I knew it would work.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.435
I just knew it.

27:25.478 --> 27:27.688
- I have a clear shot!
- Take it, Howard!

27:29.398 --> 27:30.691
Jarvis!

27:47.750 --> 27:49.043
No. No!

27:49.794 --> 27:51.837
- Whitney Frost, you are under arrest!
- No!

27:52.672 --> 27:54.423
Please! I need it!

27:54.674 --> 27:55.716
Give it back!

27:55.800 --> 27:57.134
- Come on.
- No!

27:57.343 --> 28:00.096
Hey, look at that. Your face is fixed.

28:00.763 --> 28:03.057
You'll look real pretty in prison.
Let's get her to the car.

28:03.265 --> 28:04.600
Let me go!

28:04.684 --> 28:06.060
Let me go!

28:10.189 --> 28:11.273
What could be the matter?

28:11.357 --> 28:13.567
I don't know.
Maybe one of the relays failed.

28:14.819 --> 28:16.654
- What is it?
- The radio controller's not responding.

28:16.904 --> 28:18.280
- Can you fix it?
- Working on it.

28:18.364 --> 28:19.448
The rift is becoming unstable.

28:19.532 --> 28:21.534
We need to shut it down
before we lose control of it.

28:21.867 --> 28:23.452
- What about the Gamma Cannon?
- Still recharging.

28:23.703 --> 28:26.455
There is one other option,
but it's not good.

28:26.872 --> 28:28.708
- We could use the manual override.
- Well, then use it.

28:29.166 --> 28:32.378
The crank is on the device,
on the right-hand side of the base.

28:32.837 --> 28:35.548
So whoever shuts it down will be
in the danger zone when the rift closes.

28:35.965 --> 28:38.759
- Meaning they'll get sucked inside.
- That's about the size of it.

28:39.969 --> 28:41.387
- I'll do it.
- Nope.

28:41.637 --> 28:43.973
I built it... Badly, as it turns out.

28:44.140 --> 28:45.725
- It's my responsibility.
- No, let me.

28:45.808 --> 28:48.352
I was sent back the first time.
There's a chance it'll happen again.

28:48.477 --> 28:49.603
I feel I'm to blame for this. I...

28:49.687 --> 28:51.731
Wouldn't be the first suicide mission
I've come back from.

28:53.774 --> 28:54.984
Well, that's not fair.

28:56.819 --> 28:58.112
Daniel, get back here!

28:58.529 --> 29:00.531
Keep working on a way to shut it down.

29:01.574 --> 29:03.325
If you figure it out, I'll bail.

29:09.457 --> 29:10.750
Uh...

29:42.364 --> 29:43.741
It's working!

29:43.824 --> 29:45.117
Is there nothing we can do?

29:45.201 --> 29:46.702
I'm thinking.

29:48.954 --> 29:50.748
How long until
the Gamma Cannon's charged?

29:50.873 --> 29:51.999
Twenty more minutes, at least.

29:52.082 --> 29:53.417
It doesn't have enough energy to fire.

29:53.542 --> 29:55.544
Could we detonate it inside the rift?

29:55.920 --> 29:57.880
Samberly took the explosives out.

29:58.672 --> 30:00.341
Back in a jiffy!

30:02.593 --> 30:03.761
Look!

30:06.764 --> 30:08.432
Daniel, hold on!

30:25.115 --> 30:26.700
I got you, Peg!

30:28.828 --> 30:30.496
Peg, I want you to know,

30:30.579 --> 30:33.582
I'm not thinking any unsavoury
thoughts about you right now!

30:34.750 --> 30:36.627
Wait. There's one.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.590
- Are you all right, Peg?
- I've got hold of him!

30:50.641 --> 30:52.184
Peggy, let go!

30:52.351 --> 30:54.228
No, Daniel, hold on!

31:01.735 --> 31:03.946
Hey, he's not supposed to be in there!

31:04.029 --> 31:06.282
Jarvis, what the hell are you doing?

31:06.407 --> 31:07.867
Gamma Cannon can't fire,

31:07.950 --> 31:10.870
but it could be detonated
inside the rift, correct?

31:10.953 --> 31:13.038
And how are we supposed to do that?

31:13.122 --> 31:15.541
Well, it would entail
destroying your hover car,

31:15.791 --> 31:17.293
if you don't mind!

31:18.377 --> 31:21.255
Samberly, get the core
out of the Gamma Cannon!

31:40.983 --> 31:43.319
Stand back!

32:02.588 --> 32:04.715
Work good enough for you now,
Dr Wilkes?

32:08.385 --> 32:10.429
- I thought you were dead.
- I didn't faint.

32:11.013 --> 32:12.973
I... Did faint.

32:31.659 --> 32:33.953
Look, I'm only thinking
about this as a way to help humanity.

32:34.078 --> 32:36.330
Humanity? Your chief concern
is helping your bank account.

32:36.413 --> 32:38.958
People thought that splitting the atom
would be the end of the world.

32:39.041 --> 32:40.542
- Look at us now.
- Yes, look at us...

32:40.668 --> 32:42.962
Developing exponentially
more horrific ways to kill each other.

32:43.128 --> 32:46.757
Zero Matter, in the right hands, could've
launched us a hundred years ahead.

32:46.966 --> 32:49.343
- Technologically speaking, if we...
- Is he still whining about this?

32:49.843 --> 32:52.304
- Until the end of time. Sleep well?
- I did.

32:52.680 --> 32:54.056
- And I could sleep another week.
- Mmm-mmm.

32:54.515 --> 32:55.849
I'm sorry, Doc.

32:55.933 --> 32:58.978
But I expect to see you in the office,
8:00 a.m. sharp, come Monday.

32:59.728 --> 33:00.813
What's this now?

33:01.021 --> 33:03.899
Mr Stark has very graciously offered me
a position in his new facility.

33:04.024 --> 33:06.360
- I didn't know he had one.
- I have all this land in Malibu.

33:06.443 --> 33:07.861
It's not doing anything.

33:08.070 --> 33:10.114
There's this new project
I came up with in Peru.

33:11.073 --> 33:12.449
I think it could be big.

33:12.825 --> 33:14.076
Congratulations.

33:14.994 --> 33:16.954
I'm gonna go for a swim.

33:17.121 --> 33:18.789
You might want to stay inside.

33:18.998 --> 33:21.041
Bathing suits cause
too much friction drag.

33:21.417 --> 33:22.918
Well, the warning is appreciated.

33:30.843 --> 33:32.553
- Back to New York?
- Yes.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.346
It's been a much
longer trip than expected.

33:38.809 --> 33:41.061
Perhaps if we'd met
under different circumstances.

33:42.271 --> 33:45.441
I've learned that dwelling
on what might have been...

33:46.650 --> 33:48.485
It's no way to live.

33:51.822 --> 33:54.324
I'm very happy to have had
the chance to know you, Jason.

33:56.577 --> 33:57.870
So am I.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.372
Though we never did get
our night of dinner and dancing.

34:00.831 --> 34:02.750
We did have one dance.

34:03.917 --> 34:05.419
Half a dance.

34:05.794 --> 34:07.588
I suppose that's better than nothing.

34:20.893 --> 34:23.479
Welcome home. I'm...
I'm so glad I didn't miss you.

34:23.812 --> 34:25.272
Miss Carter.

34:25.606 --> 34:27.608
You were going to leave
without saying goodbye?

34:28.150 --> 34:29.568
- Where are your manners?
- Well, I...

34:29.651 --> 34:31.862
Raised in a barn,
my granny would say.

34:32.446 --> 34:34.990
I didn't want to bother you and...

34:36.158 --> 34:37.785
Well, I... I thought perhaps you might...

34:37.868 --> 34:39.203
Might not want to see me.

34:40.788 --> 34:42.206
Mrs Jarvis, I'm so sorry.

34:46.627 --> 34:48.670
I am home, and I'm safe,

34:49.463 --> 34:51.965
and I'm with a man who I adore,
who is in one piece.

34:52.758 --> 34:55.469
- Mr Jarvis is a lucky man.
- I am, indeed.

34:56.637 --> 34:58.055
I'll just get Mrs Jarvis settled,

34:58.263 --> 35:00.057
and then I'll be happy to take you
wherever you need to go.

35:00.307 --> 35:01.350
Oh, that won't be necessary.

35:01.433 --> 35:03.727
I've already rung for a taxi.
It'll be here any moment.

35:09.358 --> 35:13.612
Oh. Yes, I see.

35:13.695 --> 35:15.364
But truly, you should stay
here with your wife.

35:15.572 --> 35:17.533
- I'll be fine.
- No, of course it is. Fine, fine, fine.

35:18.575 --> 35:21.078
I beg you, allow him to take you.
We shall never hear the end of it.

35:22.162 --> 35:24.206
Well, all right.
I mean, I suppose I...

35:24.373 --> 35:25.958
- Edwin!
- Splendid!

35:26.208 --> 35:28.001
I'll get your bags.

35:35.008 --> 35:36.385
It's gone.

35:38.428 --> 35:39.972
It's all gone.

35:41.974 --> 35:44.935
Everything I worked so hard
to accomplish.

35:51.108 --> 35:53.277
What should I do?

35:54.653 --> 35:56.822
- We'll fix it.
- No. No.

35:59.533 --> 36:01.285
I don't think that's possible.

36:02.619 --> 36:04.746
They took it away from me, Cal.

36:06.081 --> 36:09.001
Darling, you'll find it.
You just have to keep looking.

36:10.544 --> 36:11.795
We'll do it together.

36:13.881 --> 36:15.632
Like we always do.

36:18.886 --> 36:20.262
It's okay.

36:22.014 --> 36:23.390
It's okay.

36:24.349 --> 36:27.769
Oh, Cal, you were always so good to me.

36:29.354 --> 36:31.899
What did I ever do to deserve you?

36:33.233 --> 36:34.484
I know.

36:37.154 --> 36:38.322
Like we always do.

36:38.447 --> 36:40.782
Sir, you can't give her those.

36:42.326 --> 36:43.410
Why not?

36:43.660 --> 36:45.829
She'll just try to use them
to claw her face open.

36:56.882 --> 37:00.385
Hey! There's my beautiful girl.

37:08.769 --> 37:10.979
I'd be quite happy to take you
on to the airport, Miss Carter.

37:11.104 --> 37:12.814
No, you've done
more than enough, Mr Jarvis.

37:13.190 --> 37:14.650
There's paperwork to finish up here.

37:14.816 --> 37:16.401
I'll get a ride from Chief Thompson.

37:20.364 --> 37:23.075
Now, you may wish
to carry your overcoat with you.

37:23.825 --> 37:25.661
The New York weather
forecast predicts sleet.

37:25.744 --> 37:27.913
- Oh? Oh...
- And hail.

37:28.956 --> 37:31.416
Yes, well, summer's
just around the bend...

37:32.209 --> 37:33.961
In several months.

37:36.338 --> 37:40.133
If I may, it seems Los Angeles
has rather agreed with you, Miss Carter.

37:41.051 --> 37:43.095
Are you certain you need
to return to New York?

37:43.679 --> 37:46.640
Are you trying to convince me to stay
in a city that you claim to detest?

37:47.432 --> 37:51.019
The preposterous palm trees,
the heat, terrible drivers...

37:51.144 --> 37:53.063
No, no, I... I... I... Fair point, yes.

37:53.146 --> 37:55.691
I admit I have grown
rather fond of certain elements.

37:57.359 --> 37:58.694
Have you tried a taco?

37:59.152 --> 38:01.363
Oh! Delightful.

38:01.697 --> 38:03.240
My whole life is in New York.

38:03.949 --> 38:05.200
My roommate, my job...

38:05.367 --> 38:07.244
- My plane ticket's already booked.
- Of course.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.246
All very good reasons to leave.

38:09.496 --> 38:12.624
But perhaps all you need
is one compelling reason to stay.

38:20.674 --> 38:21.967
That's the last of it.

38:22.592 --> 38:24.803
The Isodyne case is officially closed.

38:25.178 --> 38:27.764
Congratulations, Chief.
Another feather in your cap.

38:27.848 --> 38:30.225
We didn't destroy the world,
which is a win in my book.

38:32.311 --> 38:35.814
Look, I... Got to say something to you
about what happened at the rift.

38:36.064 --> 38:37.733
Oh! There's no need to thank me.

38:38.108 --> 38:40.569
Actually, I was gonna say
you messed up.

38:41.862 --> 38:42.988
Big.

38:43.447 --> 38:45.198
- Sorry, what?
- As your supervisor...

38:45.282 --> 38:47.617
- You're not my supervisor.
- As a supervisor,

38:47.784 --> 38:51.663
I feel obligated to tell you your actions
were ill-advised and reckless.

38:51.747 --> 38:53.373
III-adv... Reckless?

38:53.498 --> 38:54.750
You're damn right.

38:54.875 --> 38:57.252
By your own professed rules,
you should've allowed me to be sucked

38:57.336 --> 38:59.254
into the rift and shut it down, period.

38:59.629 --> 39:01.089
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

39:01.173 --> 39:03.133
You talk a pretty big game
when it's your life on the line,

39:03.216 --> 39:05.886
Carter, but when it's somebody
else's, pretty big hypocrite.

39:07.721 --> 39:09.598
Nothing to say? No quick comeback?

39:28.700 --> 39:30.202
Good point.

39:45.967 --> 39:47.594
What? She's taking more vacation?

39:47.969 --> 39:50.305
Unbelievable.
Well, I guess I'm flying back alone.

39:51.681 --> 39:53.183
LA?

39:53.558 --> 39:55.227
You couldn't pay
me enough to stick around here.

39:55.310 --> 39:56.937
This whole place gives me heat rash.
And you can't find

39:57.020 --> 39:58.814
a decent pizza within a hundred miles.

39:58.897 --> 39:59.981
I'm coming!

40:00.065 --> 40:02.109
All right, they're
throwing me out of here. I got to go.

40:04.319 --> 40:05.904
I'm leaving! Just give me a second.
