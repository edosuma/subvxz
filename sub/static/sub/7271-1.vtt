00:34.997 --> 00:37.204
Let me show you
what I made today.

00:37.666 --> 00:39.576
I can't wait.

00:40.044 --> 00:41.704
I need to go upstairs
and change...

00:42.171 --> 00:43.879
and then I'll start dinner.

01:04.068 --> 01:07.104
Oh, yes, it's ladies night,
and the feel--

01:07.571 --> 01:09.030
Showtime.

01:13.536 --> 01:15.694
Rough day at the office,
Mrs Dunleavy?

01:16.163 --> 01:18.915
You'll feel better once you
get out of those work clothes.

01:19.375 --> 01:21.664
And into some sweats.

01:25.214 --> 01:28.879
I wish you'd let me
rub those feet.

01:29.343 --> 01:31.751
Of course,
I wouldn't use my hands.

01:44.734 --> 01:48.268
I think Victoria
just told me her secret.

01:54.368 --> 01:58.496
Deedly dee.
Are those things for me?

02:03.294 --> 02:05.749
Mom, coming in.

02:06.213 --> 02:08.704
Scottie Dunleavy?

02:09.175 --> 02:11.416
What unfortunate timing.

02:11.886 --> 02:16.014
Get out. Don't you know
this is naughty time?

02:16.474 --> 02:17.636
I'll get it.

02:20.811 --> 02:23.385
Hello, Scottie. Why don't you
be a good little boy...

02:23.856 --> 02:26.525
go downstairs
and let your mother get comfy?

02:26.984 --> 02:28.063
Who is this?

02:28.527 --> 02:31.065
This is a big bird who wants
to see the rest of Mommy.

02:37.370 --> 02:40.157
Oh, my God, Scottie.
Is that a man up our tree?

02:40.623 --> 02:43.244
No, no.
Tell her it's just a big bird.

03:06.232 --> 03:07.607
Hey, pal, welcome.

03:08.067 --> 03:11.021
Welcome to what? Where am l?

03:11.487 --> 03:13.859
Aren't you that horny guy who
was pretending to be a big bird?

03:14.323 --> 03:16.446
Checking out that beautiful mom?

03:16.909 --> 03:18.107
Yes, I am.

03:18.577 --> 03:21.828
Now you'll see what a big horny
bird actually looks like...

03:22.289 --> 03:23.832
in Hell!

03:33.968 --> 03:37.301
I deserve this!

04:07.460 --> 04:10.793
-Knock, knock.
-Hey, Jimmy.

04:11.255 --> 04:13.497
-What are you doing, Nicky?
-Just jamming.

04:13.966 --> 04:16.671
Your father wants you and your
brothers in the throne room.

04:17.136 --> 04:19.093
He's not retiring today, is he?

04:19.555 --> 04:21.262
He wants to talk to you
and Cassius and Adrian...

04:21.724 --> 04:24.131
about who'll rule Hell
for the next 10,000 years.

04:24.602 --> 04:27.175
Why do I need to go?
He won't pick me.

04:27.646 --> 04:30.600
I happen to think
you'd make a great Devil.

04:31.067 --> 04:33.854
I'm not into evil and torture
and all that stuff.

04:34.320 --> 04:37.071
Plus, the Prince of Darkness
should look distinguished...

04:37.531 --> 04:40.651
and let's face facts,
I'm no George Clooney.

04:41.118 --> 04:43.075
You're not
a bad-looking guy, Nicky.

04:43.537 --> 04:44.996
Look at that picture.

04:47.666 --> 04:48.947
I used to talk normal, too...

04:49.418 --> 04:52.668
before Cassius hit me
in the face with a shovel.

04:53.130 --> 04:55.917
That's me now, and I accept it.

04:56.384 --> 04:59.171
Your brothers are two of
the sickest guys I've ever seen.

04:59.637 --> 05:02.128
For some reason, you're not.
Nothing to be ashamed of.

05:02.598 --> 05:05.848
Their mothers were fire dragons
and mine was a goat.

05:06.310 --> 05:07.473
How do I compete with that?

05:07.937 --> 05:11.187
Your mother was not a goat.
They're just playing with you.

05:11.649 --> 05:14.899
If one of those psychos
gets picked, I'm doomed.

05:15.361 --> 05:17.400
I knew it, Adrian.
He's finally retiring.

05:17.863 --> 05:23.071
Cassius, I've been waiting on
this day for 10,000 years.

05:25.579 --> 05:26.860
If the old man picks me
to take over Hell...

05:27.331 --> 05:31.578
I'll keep torture going 24-7.
No breaks.

05:32.044 --> 05:33.075
Whoa, mama!

05:33.546 --> 05:36.119
You got him right in the eye.

05:36.590 --> 05:39.544
Hey! How's Daddy's
little girl doing today?

05:40.010 --> 05:42.632
I didn't see you guys.
What's up?

05:43.097 --> 05:45.136
Shovel face,
you want to mind-wrestle?

05:45.599 --> 05:46.679
Nah, I'm all right.

05:47.143 --> 05:48.969
I was thinking of chilling out
by the throne for a bit.

05:49.437 --> 05:51.725
I'm going to mind-wrestle you
whether you like it or not.

05:52.189 --> 05:54.645
I have to warn you,
I'm getting pretty good at it.

05:55.109 --> 05:57.481
Then I guess
I can't make you do this.

05:57.945 --> 06:01.646
Mercy. You win.
I give. Game over.

06:02.116 --> 06:03.396
What are you boys doing?

06:06.328 --> 06:09.947
Nothing, Dad. Just hitting
the old punching bags.

06:10.416 --> 06:11.495
Cassius...

06:11.959 --> 06:14.877
didn't I tell you to stay out
of your brother's mind?

06:15.337 --> 06:16.748
I forgot.

06:17.214 --> 06:19.006
Maybe this
will help you remember.

06:22.928 --> 06:25.680
Now, everybody come sit down.

06:26.140 --> 06:28.429
-Hey, Dad.
-Yes, son?

06:28.893 --> 06:30.007
I know you got a lot
on your mind...

06:30.478 --> 06:33.514
but I almost finished that
Monsters of Metal compilation.

06:33.981 --> 06:36.021
I really think it's turning
into a masterpiece.

06:36.484 --> 06:37.978
OK, kid.
We'll listen to it later.

06:38.444 --> 06:39.903
Thanks.

06:43.657 --> 06:45.946
A window.

06:46.410 --> 06:50.325
Hello, Mr Devil.
I like your cape.

06:58.464 --> 07:00.421
I deserve this!

07:00.883 --> 07:05.675
Fellas, this,
as some of you might know...

07:06.138 --> 07:09.922
is my 10,000th year
as Prince of Darkness...

07:10.393 --> 07:13.512
so I think the time has come
to discuss who will succeed me.

07:13.979 --> 07:16.435
-Knock, knock.
-Yes, Jimmy?

07:16.899 --> 07:17.978
Don't forget--

07:18.442 --> 07:21.811
you're shoving a pineapple
up Hitler's ass at four p.m.

07:24.573 --> 07:27.823
This was a very
difficult decision...

07:28.285 --> 07:30.955
because I have
three wonderful sons.

07:31.414 --> 07:35.162
Adrian--so smart, so ruthless.

07:35.626 --> 07:36.657
Wears makeup.

07:37.128 --> 07:40.995
And Cassius--
so strong, so tough.

07:41.465 --> 07:43.292
Don't forget clinically insane.

07:43.759 --> 07:45.419
And Nicky...

07:46.762 --> 07:48.589
such a sweet boy.

07:50.349 --> 07:55.141
But after much thought
and careful consideration...

07:55.604 --> 07:58.771
I've decided that the ruler
for the next 10,000 years...

07:59.233 --> 08:00.692
is going to have to be...

08:03.404 --> 08:04.317
me.

08:04.780 --> 08:06.191
-What?
-Hallelujah!

08:06.657 --> 08:08.982
I mean, that sucks!

08:09.452 --> 08:11.693
The important thing
for the stability of our rule...

08:12.163 --> 08:14.570
is to maintain the balance
between good and evil...

08:15.041 --> 08:18.374
and I don't think any of you are
ready for that responsibility.

08:18.836 --> 08:20.745
Dad, this is bullshit!

08:21.213 --> 08:24.131
I don't like that language.

08:26.969 --> 08:27.918
Right. Send him in.

08:28.387 --> 08:30.012
Sorry, boys.
I have to get back to work.

08:30.473 --> 08:31.967
It was good
hanging with you, Dad.

08:32.433 --> 08:33.429
I'll check you later.

08:58.876 --> 09:00.039
You're serious?

09:12.390 --> 09:14.299
Off, off, off!

09:15.726 --> 09:16.757
Damn!

09:17.228 --> 09:19.220
Twenty thousand years ago,
Grandpa Lucifer said...

09:19.688 --> 09:23.354
"It's better to rule in Hell
than to serve in Heaven."

09:23.818 --> 09:26.902
Well, I'm tired
of serving in Hell.

09:27.363 --> 09:30.566
We need somewhere
where we can rule.

09:33.869 --> 09:36.823
Bring it on, big man.
Let's see what you got.

09:39.583 --> 09:42.999
Could you concentrate
for five seconds?

09:43.462 --> 09:44.791
I am concentrating, man.

09:45.256 --> 09:46.370
I'm sorry.

09:46.841 --> 09:49.414
After careful consideration,
I must respectfully decline.

09:49.885 --> 09:51.428
I can't stand retirement.

09:51.887 --> 09:53.880
Just let me win one Super Bowl.

09:54.348 --> 09:57.266
In exchange for eternal
damnation of your soul?

09:57.727 --> 10:00.348
You're much too nice a guy
for that, Mr Marino.

10:00.813 --> 10:02.188
You did it for Namath.

10:02.648 --> 10:03.846
Joe was coming here anyways.

10:04.316 --> 10:05.692
This sucks.

10:06.152 --> 10:07.562
I'll go to the Super Bowl
as an announcer...

10:08.028 --> 10:09.024
and win myself an Emmy!

10:09.488 --> 10:10.188
That's the spirit.

10:10.656 --> 10:12.364
You're a good Devil, Dad.

10:12.825 --> 10:15.494
I also happen to be a Jets fan.

10:15.953 --> 10:18.954
What do you think about Earth?

10:19.415 --> 10:20.992
We could create
our own Hell there.

10:21.459 --> 10:23.700
Are you saying we go up there
and kill everyone?

10:24.170 --> 10:25.284
Eventually, Cassius...

10:25.755 --> 10:27.878
but first we'd have to corrupt
as many souls as we can...

10:28.340 --> 10:30.582
so when we do destroy them...

10:31.052 --> 10:33.424
Their damned souls will be ours.

10:33.888 --> 10:35.797
It's our time, brother.

10:42.354 --> 10:45.308
This is not good.

10:46.776 --> 10:48.353
Whoa, whoa.
Fellas, what are you doing?

10:48.819 --> 10:49.851
We're leaving.

10:50.321 --> 10:51.483
You can't go through there!

10:51.947 --> 10:54.320
The fire flows in, not out.

10:58.496 --> 10:59.871
You really suck!

11:01.707 --> 11:03.914
Your Evilness!

11:04.377 --> 11:06.084
Cassius and Adrian
have escaped from Hell.

11:06.545 --> 11:08.372
They went out through the fire
and froze it.

11:08.839 --> 11:12.291
I tried to stop them, sir,
but they overpowered me.

11:17.390 --> 11:19.881
Calm down. Get off your knees.

11:20.351 --> 11:22.343
Thank you for understanding,
Your Wickedness.

11:22.812 --> 11:25.267
You're the man.
I've always said that.

11:29.860 --> 11:31.141
Are there boobs on my head?

11:31.612 --> 11:33.190
Yeah. Big ones.

11:33.656 --> 11:35.364
What's going on, Dad?

11:35.825 --> 11:37.817
I'm going to die, Nicky.
The gates are broken.

11:38.285 --> 11:42.069
No new souls can get in,
so I'll start to deteriorate.

11:43.624 --> 11:45.166
What's with all
those "hoo hoo" noises?

11:45.626 --> 11:46.492
Everything's fine, Pop.

11:46.961 --> 11:48.835
Everything's fine?
Who are you bullshitting?

11:49.296 --> 11:51.966
Last time you said that,
the Renaissance happened.

11:52.425 --> 11:54.666
Please, Pop,
go back to your room.

11:55.136 --> 11:56.131
Can I take him with me?

11:56.595 --> 11:58.837
Sure, Pop. Whatever you want.

11:59.306 --> 12:01.050
Tit-head, go with my father.

12:07.231 --> 12:08.773
Not a damn soul is going
to get through that.

12:09.233 --> 12:10.775
This fire is solid as rock.

12:11.235 --> 12:13.026
We got to get this bad boy
burning again.

12:13.487 --> 12:14.483
To do that,
Cassius and Adrian...

12:14.947 --> 12:17.105
have to come back through
the other way.

12:17.575 --> 12:18.606
So go get them, Dad.

12:19.076 --> 12:22.860
I'm too weak.
The process has already begun.

12:23.330 --> 12:24.825
So go get them, Jimmy.

12:25.291 --> 12:27.580
I'm just a demon.
No Devil blood in me.

12:28.044 --> 12:30.581
I wouldn't last two minutes
with your brothers.

12:31.047 --> 12:32.956
Are you saying it's up to me?

12:34.800 --> 12:36.793
You said no souls
could get through that.

12:37.261 --> 12:41.306
Nicky, are you a soul
or the spawn of Satan?

12:42.391 --> 12:43.885
I never been to Earth, Dad.

12:44.351 --> 12:47.021
I never even slept over
some other dude's house.

12:47.480 --> 12:50.267
The worst thing that could
happen is you get killed.

12:50.733 --> 12:53.900
In which case, boom--
you end up back here.

12:54.361 --> 12:57.362
So I need to go to Earth
and kill my brothers?

12:57.823 --> 13:01.524
No go. They left together
at the exact same time.

13:01.994 --> 13:05.529
They must come back together
at the exact same time.

13:05.998 --> 13:07.576
Here.

13:08.042 --> 13:09.501
Get them to drink from this.

13:09.960 --> 13:11.419
One sip,
and they'll be trapped inside.

13:11.879 --> 13:16.256
Once you've got both of them,
bring it back through the gate.

13:16.717 --> 13:18.425
Let me, sir.

13:18.886 --> 13:20.001
Gross!

13:22.390 --> 13:24.263
He's got less than a week.

13:27.311 --> 13:30.146
Dad, I don't know
if I can do this.

13:30.606 --> 13:32.682
Son, you...

13:33.150 --> 13:34.609
Try your best.

14:01.053 --> 14:02.216
Earth.

14:03.806 --> 14:06.379
It doesn't look too bad.

14:17.403 --> 14:19.479
You were gone ten seconds.
What happened?

14:19.947 --> 14:25.404
I got hit by this big light
attached to a lot of metal.

14:25.870 --> 14:28.491
That's a train, son.
Don't stand in front of them.

14:28.956 --> 14:31.079
I'll have to take a mulligan
on this one.

14:31.542 --> 14:34.413
Please, Nicky,
get back up there.

14:34.879 --> 14:35.744
All right.

14:36.213 --> 14:37.708
I'll get that for you, sir.

14:50.019 --> 14:51.513
I'm Nicky.

14:51.979 --> 14:53.094
That's terrific.

14:53.564 --> 14:56.482
Now get off the track
and come with me, handsome.

14:57.860 --> 15:01.311
Welcome to Grand Central Station
in New York City.

15:01.781 --> 15:03.489
My name is Beefy.

15:03.949 --> 15:05.609
I'm an old friend
of your father's.

15:06.077 --> 15:07.072
He asked me to help you out.

15:07.536 --> 15:10.454
I just want to find my brothers
and be on my way.

15:10.915 --> 15:11.828
It's not going to be easy.

15:12.291 --> 15:13.620
Your brothers
can possess people...

15:14.085 --> 15:15.793
so they probably
won't look like themselves.

15:16.253 --> 15:20.037
You have to be suspicious
of everyone.

15:20.508 --> 15:21.706
All right, bro.

15:22.176 --> 15:25.426
The jig is up, then.
Get in the flask.

15:25.888 --> 15:27.086
It ain't me, moron.

15:27.556 --> 15:28.837
Sorry.

15:29.308 --> 15:32.973
There's this blind guy outside
you might think is possessed...

15:33.437 --> 15:35.679
but he's just crazy.

15:37.316 --> 15:39.356
Though I cannot see
with these blind eyes...

15:39.819 --> 15:41.895
I know the good Lord
still loves me.

15:42.363 --> 15:43.691
He loves all of his children.

15:44.156 --> 15:45.698
-Why, he loves you...
-That's him.

15:46.158 --> 15:47.783
...and he loves you.

15:49.078 --> 15:50.869
Here he goes.

15:51.330 --> 15:54.366
You make the Lord very nervous.

15:54.834 --> 15:55.580
All right.

15:56.043 --> 15:57.703
-I'm burning now.
-Take it easy.

15:58.170 --> 16:00.246
Hellfire is burning me alive!

16:00.715 --> 16:03.003
He's burning.

16:03.467 --> 16:05.424
The Beast is alive!
He's among us!

16:05.886 --> 16:10.299
Clear the streets!
The Devil is here!

16:12.518 --> 16:14.392
Making friends already.

16:14.854 --> 16:16.645
I don't know
what that guy's problem was.

16:17.106 --> 16:18.102
It's freezing up here.

16:18.566 --> 16:20.558
You're in the human world now,
kid.

16:21.026 --> 16:23.897
You'll feel a lot of new things
you never felt before.

16:24.363 --> 16:28.195
Let's get you some warm clothes
and hot food.

16:38.044 --> 16:40.617
Put it in your mouth.

16:46.427 --> 16:50.341
Now move your teeth
up and down.

16:53.392 --> 16:54.590
Up and down.

16:55.061 --> 16:56.341
Good, numb nuts.

16:56.812 --> 16:58.520
Now you got to swallow it.

16:58.981 --> 17:00.808
Tilt your head back...

17:01.275 --> 17:04.858
and let the meat
slide down your throat hole.

17:05.320 --> 17:07.396
Easy. Don't choke.

17:11.035 --> 17:14.819
Popeye's chicken
is fucking awesome.

17:15.289 --> 17:16.949
Now eat up.
You'll need your energy.

17:17.415 --> 17:20.334
I got energy up the ying-yang.
Let's save Dad.

17:20.795 --> 17:22.787
Adrian! Cassius!

17:24.507 --> 17:25.205
Oh, boy.

17:25.674 --> 17:27.417
So nice.

17:33.808 --> 17:34.803
I like your brassiere.

17:35.267 --> 17:37.640
Thank you.

17:38.104 --> 17:40.891
Could you guys maybe
not tell anyone about this?

17:41.357 --> 17:42.353
You got it.

17:42.817 --> 17:44.940
Do you mind maybe not telling
anybody about this?

17:45.403 --> 17:46.813
You got it.

17:48.489 --> 17:51.062
Look, sidewalk equals safety.

17:51.534 --> 17:53.111
Middle of the road equals death.

17:53.577 --> 17:58.370
From now on, I'll just avoid
all moving metal objects.

17:58.833 --> 18:02.332
Great. Now, your father
gave me some deposit money...

18:02.795 --> 18:05.001
for a nice pad
on the Upper East Side...

18:05.464 --> 18:07.623
but I misplaced it.

18:11.554 --> 18:13.842
I'm wasted!

18:14.306 --> 18:17.011
So I found
this other joint for you...

18:17.476 --> 18:19.184
but you're going
to have a roommate.

18:19.645 --> 18:22.053
There's only one thing better...

18:22.523 --> 18:24.266
than drinking
an ice-cold whiskey sour...

18:24.734 --> 18:26.940
on a hot Alabama night...

18:27.403 --> 18:29.561
and that's telling the truth.

18:30.030 --> 18:32.604
I know what you think
about me, Grandma.

18:33.075 --> 18:34.867
You think I'm worthless.

18:35.327 --> 18:36.738
You think I'm a stumblebum...

18:37.204 --> 18:39.695
who ain't never going
to amount to anything.

18:40.166 --> 18:42.372
Well, old woman, you are wrong.

18:45.921 --> 18:47.380
You are wrong.

18:52.094 --> 18:54.585
Hello, friend.
My name is Nicky.

18:55.056 --> 18:57.048
I understand
you are seeking a roommate...

18:57.516 --> 19:00.007
as per your ad
in the "Village Voice."

19:00.478 --> 19:02.969
Would it be possible for me
to fill the slot?

19:03.439 --> 19:05.348
Don't you want
to know what rent is?

19:07.359 --> 19:09.815
Yes. What is rent?

19:10.279 --> 19:12.236
It's 1,200,
split down the middle.

19:12.698 --> 19:15.485
Tuesdays and Thursdays,
I rehearse with my partner...

19:15.951 --> 19:17.410
so the living room's
going to be off-limits.

19:17.870 --> 19:18.985
Off-limits.

19:19.455 --> 19:21.780
Aren't you boiling hot
in that outfit?

19:22.249 --> 19:24.954
It's 80 degrees in this hallway.
Where are you from, the South?

19:29.799 --> 19:31.459
The Deep South.

19:36.472 --> 19:39.045
-Why is that funny?
-I don't know.

19:39.517 --> 19:44.179
OK. And sorry, guy,
but no doggies allowed.

19:44.647 --> 19:47.054
Go on. Big day tomorrow.

19:47.525 --> 19:49.980
And don't forget to do that
sleep thing I told you about.

19:50.444 --> 19:51.025
Gotcha.

19:51.487 --> 19:53.444
You're not my brother, are you?

19:53.906 --> 19:54.985
I'm an only child.

19:55.449 --> 19:57.027
You love acting.

19:57.493 --> 19:59.236
I love pissing.

20:35.573 --> 20:37.861
Oh, my God!

20:53.049 --> 20:53.914
In today's Gospel...

20:54.383 --> 20:56.340
the Lord tells us
how we should live...

20:56.802 --> 20:59.673
if we wish to attain
the splendour of Heaven.

21:00.139 --> 21:01.598
Or something like that.

21:02.933 --> 21:05.389
Jesus this, Moses that.

21:05.853 --> 21:08.344
Abraham hit me
with a wiffle ball bat.

21:15.029 --> 21:20.272
The Lord said a lot of hibbity
jibbity bibbity swibbity.

21:21.410 --> 21:22.608
But...

21:23.079 --> 21:26.329
has he ever really done
anything for any of us?

21:26.791 --> 21:30.871
Has he ever put a Jaguar XJR
in my driveway?

21:31.337 --> 21:32.333
No.

21:32.797 --> 21:33.959
I love that car.

21:34.423 --> 21:38.255
Has the Lord given
any of my enemies the herpes?

21:38.719 --> 21:39.834
No.

21:40.304 --> 21:44.883
The Lord gave my son
the strength to get off drugs.

21:46.352 --> 21:47.514
Ma'am, I know your son...

21:47.978 --> 21:50.600
and, believe me,
he was better off on the drugs.

21:51.065 --> 21:53.022
At least
when he was smoking hashish...

21:53.484 --> 21:55.477
he used to make me laugh
occasionally.

21:57.738 --> 21:59.363
After we tried for many years...

21:59.824 --> 22:03.240
the Lord finally helped
my wife conceive a baby.

22:04.328 --> 22:07.779
Your best friend Fitzy
helped your wife.

22:08.249 --> 22:12.792
He helped her conceive it
all night long.

22:16.507 --> 22:18.001
How about you, Mayor?

22:18.467 --> 22:19.796
Has the Lord
ever done anything for you?

22:20.261 --> 22:25.006
Well, you know, I wished
I could think of something...

22:25.474 --> 22:27.431
but, to be honest with you,
I can't.

22:27.893 --> 22:30.384
I can't think of a damn thing
he's ever done for me!

22:30.855 --> 22:33.772
Kind of makes you wonder
if there even is a Lord...

22:34.233 --> 22:38.978
if there is ultimate punishment
for our so-called sins.

22:39.447 --> 22:40.941
Why don't we just have fun...

22:41.407 --> 22:44.028
and do whatever the Hell
we want?

22:44.493 --> 22:47.827
Let the sin begin!

22:51.083 --> 22:53.242
Let the sin begin.

22:53.711 --> 22:55.205
That was a good one.

22:55.671 --> 22:57.996
This is so much fun!

22:58.466 --> 22:59.711
I never want it to end.

23:00.176 --> 23:03.177
Why should it end?
Who's going to stop us?

23:06.891 --> 23:09.049
Come on. There's ten million
people in this city...

23:09.226 --> 23:10.008
and the clock is ticking.

23:10.478 --> 23:12.554
Let's rock and roll, then.

23:14.982 --> 23:17.188
-Get in the flask.
-I'm not thirsty!

23:20.154 --> 23:21.399
Cassius, I'll show you.

23:23.157 --> 23:24.485
Cassius, get in the flask.

23:26.702 --> 23:28.659
Get in the flask.

23:29.121 --> 23:30.663
-May I help you?
-Get in the flask.

23:31.123 --> 23:32.154
What are you talking about?

23:32.625 --> 23:34.914
I'm talking about
an eight-piece. Let's go.

23:35.378 --> 23:38.462
Look, it's OKfor me
to shit in the street...

23:38.923 --> 23:41.840
but you got to use a toilet.

23:42.301 --> 23:44.128
Nicky, where are you?

23:44.595 --> 23:45.840
Aw, come on.

23:46.305 --> 23:47.301
What's he doing now?

23:47.765 --> 23:51.216
Just get in the flask.
I got to get Adrian.

23:59.318 --> 24:01.524
Gary's so hairy.

24:01.987 --> 24:03.530
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

24:09.787 --> 24:11.826
All that chasing
and running around...

24:12.289 --> 24:14.662
is making me want
to do the sleep thing again.

24:15.126 --> 24:19.075
Kid, I like your enthusiasm,
but we have to work on...

24:19.547 --> 24:21.539
narrowing down
our list of suspects.

24:22.007 --> 24:26.551
I'm going to check in with
some of my contacts uptown.

24:33.018 --> 24:37.515
Kid's got a lot of evil in him
just begging to come out.

25:06.052 --> 25:08.009
I will eat your heart.

25:12.391 --> 25:13.506
There's our man.

25:13.976 --> 25:18.056
Mr Sleepyhead must have some
major ties to the dark side.

25:19.607 --> 25:20.603
What's with that guy?

25:21.067 --> 25:22.893
It's got to be one
of his disciples or something.

25:25.237 --> 25:27.610
My man's into
deep nocturnal shit.

25:30.201 --> 25:31.992
I think that Devil guy
just got ripped off.

25:32.453 --> 25:35.370
-Should we wake him up?
-You do it.

25:38.918 --> 25:41.041
Rise and shine, Devil guy.

25:41.504 --> 25:42.914
Some dude stole your shit.

25:43.381 --> 25:44.923
What? Where?

25:47.885 --> 25:50.210
-Which way did he go?
-That way.

25:50.679 --> 25:52.921
Thanks. Give me back my flask!

25:53.391 --> 25:55.348
Did you check out
the dragon mouth?

25:55.810 --> 25:57.933
The Dark Prince is here.

26:11.909 --> 26:14.317
Check out my stuff.
I got a comb only used twice.

26:14.787 --> 26:18.037
I got a pepper shaker.
A silver doodad from Africa.

26:19.125 --> 26:20.073
See something you like, my man?

26:20.543 --> 26:21.918
I would like my flask back.

26:22.378 --> 26:23.327
You calling me a thief?

26:23.796 --> 26:25.539
I'm calling you
the guy who has my flask.

26:26.006 --> 26:28.462
How would I have it
unless I was, in fact, a thief?

26:28.926 --> 26:31.084
-I don't know.
-Now you've done it.

26:31.554 --> 26:32.929
You messed
with my business, bitch.

26:33.389 --> 26:36.592
I would appreciate it
if you kept your voice down.

26:39.186 --> 26:41.096
You going all crazy-eyed on me.

26:41.564 --> 26:43.272
I'll show you some crazy eye.

26:44.525 --> 26:46.897
Look at this.
Come on, let's get busy.

26:47.361 --> 26:49.021
-Excuse me, sir.
-Who?

26:49.488 --> 26:51.896
Does that flask
belong to this man?

26:52.366 --> 26:53.825
You calling me a thief, too?
Damn.

26:54.285 --> 26:58.152
Look, the guy you ripped off
walked by and busted you...

26:58.622 --> 27:01.789
so why don't you just give him
his flask back?

27:02.251 --> 27:04.920
You going to bite me with
your snaggletooth if I don't?

27:05.379 --> 27:10.504
No. But that policeman
might have something to say.

27:12.803 --> 27:15.970
Take your dumb-ass canteen,
goofy.

27:16.432 --> 27:18.721
Get your raggedy-ass clothes
and find another corner...

27:19.185 --> 27:20.928
before I show you
what crazy really is.

27:21.395 --> 27:22.426
Fine. I will.

27:22.897 --> 27:24.936
I'm a businessman.

27:25.399 --> 27:27.522
I'll be seeing you
in a few years.

27:33.449 --> 27:35.442
Excuse me.

27:35.910 --> 27:38.946
That was amazing.
I just wanted to thank you.

27:39.413 --> 27:42.367
That's OK.
I get messed with all the time.

27:42.833 --> 27:46.167
When I saw him do that to you,
I just lost it.

27:46.629 --> 27:48.372
I hate when people
take advantage of tourists.

27:48.839 --> 27:50.998
What makes you think
I'm a tourist?

27:51.467 --> 27:53.673
Your accent, maybe.

27:54.136 --> 27:55.547
Well, where are you from?

27:56.013 --> 27:57.757
-The South.
-Really?

27:58.224 --> 27:59.766
The Deep South.

28:07.274 --> 28:08.603
Why are we laughing?

28:09.068 --> 28:12.353
I don't know,
but I was enjoying it.

28:12.822 --> 28:14.020
Your glasses are pretty.

28:14.490 --> 28:17.028
They make your eyes
look big and sparkly.

28:17.493 --> 28:18.821
It's fun looking at them.

28:19.912 --> 28:21.821
My dad's an optometrist.

28:22.289 --> 28:25.160
My dad's in Hell,
and he's falling apart.

28:25.626 --> 28:26.955
I'm sorry.

28:27.420 --> 28:28.914
It's really tough
when your folks get older.

28:29.380 --> 28:32.049
I don't know what I would do
if I couldn't save him.

28:32.508 --> 28:34.050
I'm sure a nice Southern boy
like you...

28:34.510 --> 28:35.625
will figure something out.

28:36.095 --> 28:38.052
You want some Popeye's?

28:38.514 --> 28:42.975
No. I had my lunch already.

28:43.436 --> 28:45.891
But I wouldn't mind
getting a gelati.

28:46.355 --> 28:48.846
Could I come with you
to getting a gelati?

28:49.316 --> 28:50.515
If you want to.

28:53.154 --> 28:55.526
-Here you go, pal. Enjoy.
-Thank you.

28:55.990 --> 28:57.947
It's freezing my hands.

28:58.409 --> 29:01.030
-Even with those gloves on?
-It's cold.

29:01.495 --> 29:04.911
-Let me wrap it.
-Please. Thank you.

29:05.374 --> 29:07.201
Gelati.

29:08.419 --> 29:09.534
Better?

29:13.382 --> 29:16.134
Why are you taunting me
with your darkness?

29:16.594 --> 29:20.045
Your evil,
it's stinking up our streets!

29:20.514 --> 29:25.141
The end is near!
We are all going to die!

29:27.480 --> 29:30.350
This town is really
going to Hell lately.

29:30.816 --> 29:32.524
What part of town
do you live in?

29:32.985 --> 29:34.894
I have an apartment.
I'm not sure where.

29:35.362 --> 29:36.821
My dog knows, though.

29:37.281 --> 29:38.562
You have a dog? What kind?

29:39.033 --> 29:39.946
I don't know.
I'd ask him...

29:40.409 --> 29:42.734
but he's uptown
meeting his contacts.

29:43.204 --> 29:45.492
Say "Mr Beefy." Say it.

29:45.956 --> 29:46.870
Mr Beefy.

29:47.333 --> 29:48.447
And I love you!

29:48.918 --> 29:51.788
You go to school?
What's that like?

29:52.254 --> 29:55.125
I go
to Parsons School of Design.

29:55.591 --> 29:57.584
I knew growing up
I wasn't much to look at...

29:58.052 --> 30:01.053
so I concentrated on
making things that are pretty.

30:01.514 --> 30:04.384
You have a nice smell
coming off you.

30:05.559 --> 30:06.935
That's my perfume.

30:07.395 --> 30:09.387
It's called
Comme de Sud Pacific.

30:09.855 --> 30:12.144
I think that's French
for "Coconuts."

30:17.405 --> 30:20.074
That's better than the gelati.

30:20.533 --> 30:23.652
Valerie, it feels like there's
a bunch of butterflies...

30:24.120 --> 30:26.159
flapping around
in my stomach right now.

30:26.622 --> 30:27.903
Is that normal?

30:28.374 --> 30:30.497
Sometimes, sure.

30:30.960 --> 30:33.581
Good, because I was concerned.

30:34.046 --> 30:36.418
Why did they do this to me?
I was good to them.

30:36.882 --> 30:38.674
I can hardly notice. Honest.

30:42.930 --> 30:45.053
I sure hope Nicky's
kicking some ass on Earth...

30:45.516 --> 30:46.465
or we are doomed.

30:46.934 --> 30:48.642
I was the one who created Hell.

30:49.103 --> 30:50.016
I know, Your Hatefulness.

30:50.479 --> 30:53.184
Actually, the credit
belongs to my first wife.

30:53.649 --> 30:55.606
She was the inspiration.

30:56.068 --> 30:58.275
Chewbacca, take it easy,
will you?

30:58.738 --> 31:02.522
You look like my first wife.
Only she had more hair.

31:04.410 --> 31:07.115
In another startling
announcement from City Hall...

31:07.580 --> 31:09.987
Mayor Randolph has,
effective immediately...

31:10.458 --> 31:14.502
Iowered the legal drinking age
from twenty-one to ten.

31:18.132 --> 31:20.753
When an adult goes to Hell,
that's terrific.

31:23.345 --> 31:25.753
But when a child goes...

31:28.017 --> 31:30.555
That's why I'm in this business.

31:32.438 --> 31:33.553
Little Nicky.

31:34.023 --> 31:35.185
-Know what's nice about you?
-What?

31:35.649 --> 31:38.650
I like the way you're happy
just being yourself.

31:39.111 --> 31:41.068
You don't try to act cool.

31:41.530 --> 31:43.819
Thanks much, Valerie.

31:44.283 --> 31:46.110
You know what's nice about you?

31:49.163 --> 31:52.698
Your juicy heart-shaped heinie.

31:53.167 --> 31:54.198
What was that?

31:54.668 --> 31:58.500
I don't know why I said that.
I meant to say that...

31:59.507 --> 32:04.928
I've always dreamt about
having sex with a gross pig.

32:05.388 --> 32:08.803
Can I wash my winky
in your kitchen sinky?

32:09.266 --> 32:10.547
You're a real jerk!

32:11.018 --> 32:12.393
I didn't mean to be.

32:12.853 --> 32:14.645
What the--Adrian!

32:15.981 --> 32:17.180
Dad needs you
to come back to Hell.

32:17.650 --> 32:20.355
So he sent old Shovel Face
to fetch me.

32:20.820 --> 32:22.896
I'm not kidding.
He's in trouble.

32:23.364 --> 32:24.110
So are you.

32:24.573 --> 32:27.491
Hey, Valerie!

32:32.123 --> 32:33.747
What is your problem?

32:34.208 --> 32:35.999
I'm sorry!

32:37.378 --> 32:41.839
Adrian, you froze the fire gate,
and Dad is dying...

32:42.299 --> 32:44.755
so get your booty
back home or else!

32:45.219 --> 32:46.713
You can't talk tough, Nicky.

32:47.179 --> 32:49.931
Even the voice inside your head
has a speech impediment.

32:50.391 --> 32:54.720
You're going back
because I'm going to make you!

32:55.187 --> 32:56.765
How about this?
I'll stay here...

32:57.231 --> 33:00.398
enjoying my pizza
and my peppermint schnapps...

33:00.860 --> 33:02.354
and you go back.

33:02.820 --> 33:03.816
Adrian, don't!

33:04.280 --> 33:07.281
Cut the crap! This is serious!

33:10.077 --> 33:12.568
Come on!

33:17.960 --> 33:19.241
I was driving to work today...

33:19.420 --> 33:21.080
some bozo in a Cadillac
cuts me off.

33:21.547 --> 33:22.543
So I followed him.

33:23.007 --> 33:24.999
When he got out of his car,
I run up behind him...

33:25.468 --> 33:27.507
and start bashing his brains in
with this bat.

33:27.970 --> 33:29.299
Did you ever see
"The Untouchables"?

33:29.764 --> 33:31.009
I was De Niro!

33:31.474 --> 33:33.383
What's happened to you, Regis?

33:34.477 --> 33:35.971
The mayor's office today...

33:36.437 --> 33:38.513
along with the New York
Board of Tourism...

33:38.981 --> 33:43.442
unveiled its new motto
to replace "I Love New York."

33:43.903 --> 33:47.153
"I Love Hookers" will now be
the city's catch phrase.

33:47.615 --> 33:49.358
Your brothers are upsetting
the balance...

33:49.825 --> 33:51.106
between good and evil.

33:51.577 --> 33:52.692
What can I do about it?

33:53.162 --> 33:54.740
You can't do jack shit...

33:55.206 --> 33:56.700
unless you learn
your evil powers.

33:57.166 --> 33:59.289
Go get a soda out of the fridge.

33:59.752 --> 34:01.875
But those are
my roommate's sodas.

34:02.338 --> 34:04.627
"But those are
my roommate's sodas."

34:05.091 --> 34:08.625
Does that sound like a statement
the son of the Devil would make?

34:09.094 --> 34:10.126
All right. Take it easy.

34:10.596 --> 34:13.965
You have the power to change
the cola in that can...

34:14.433 --> 34:16.592
into any other liquid.

34:17.061 --> 34:20.393
Engine oil, bat's blood,
moose piss.

34:20.856 --> 34:23.393
You just have to release
the evil within.

34:23.859 --> 34:25.056
Release the evil?

34:25.527 --> 34:28.279
I'm just saying
there's wickedness in you.

34:28.739 --> 34:29.770
I can tell from your snores.

34:30.241 --> 34:31.154
Really?

34:31.617 --> 34:33.525
Release your evil.

34:34.745 --> 34:37.367
Release the evil.

34:42.043 --> 34:43.835
Come on, you can do it.

34:44.295 --> 34:45.839
There it is.

34:46.297 --> 34:48.042
You got it in you.

34:52.429 --> 34:53.460
What are you doing?

34:57.768 --> 35:01.469
I'm going to pretend I didn't
see a dog on the couch...

35:01.939 --> 35:05.390
because my brain just can't
process that right now.

35:05.860 --> 35:07.686
But were you about
to drink one of my Cokes?

35:08.154 --> 35:10.858
No. I was just looking at it.

35:11.323 --> 35:12.403
It's beautiful.

35:22.877 --> 35:24.585
This Coke tastes like Pepsi.

35:31.385 --> 35:34.220
You changed a Coke into a Pepsi?

35:34.680 --> 35:36.803
That was
your big transformation?

35:37.266 --> 35:38.262
Come on, man,
give it up a little.

35:38.726 --> 35:40.220
It was pretty good
for my first try.

35:40.686 --> 35:43.936
Do you care that your brothers
are killing your father?

35:44.398 --> 35:45.264
Yes, I care!

35:45.733 --> 35:48.485
And he is not going to die!

35:50.696 --> 35:51.859
Atta-boy.

35:53.282 --> 35:55.607
I'm freaked out.
My television just blew up.

35:56.077 --> 35:57.986
You're damn right it did!

35:58.454 --> 36:00.078
I mean, really?

36:00.539 --> 36:02.497
I know this is
your living room time...

36:02.958 --> 36:05.449
but could I finish watching
the Globetrotters out here?

36:05.920 --> 36:08.126
It's the craziest game
I've ever seen.

36:19.975 --> 36:21.767
He's walking! Get him a bus!

36:22.228 --> 36:23.936
This is the part I don't get.

36:24.397 --> 36:25.310
Another terrible call.

36:25.773 --> 36:27.600
There's no way
that was travelling.

36:28.067 --> 36:30.024
What's with all the calls?
We haven't lost in 53 years!

36:30.486 --> 36:31.731
Guess what, cornrows?

36:32.196 --> 36:35.482
Technical foul!
You're out of here!

36:38.411 --> 36:41.115
Why's the referee being so mean
to the Globetrotters, Daddy?

36:41.580 --> 36:43.906
I've been watching these guys
play since I was your age.

36:44.375 --> 36:47.495
It's all part of the show, baby.

36:48.796 --> 36:50.919
That guy in the striped shirt...

36:51.382 --> 36:53.421
snapped his fingers
like somebody I know!

37:09.650 --> 37:12.188
Normally the Globetrotters
represent family entertainment.

37:12.653 --> 37:14.231
Who gives a shit?

37:15.906 --> 37:17.899
These kids came here to see
the Globetrotters win!

37:18.367 --> 37:22.365
Ten points off the Globetrotters
on account of the bigmouth!

37:24.832 --> 37:27.619
It's all part of the show, baby!

37:28.085 --> 37:30.457
Hit the half-time buzzer.
I'm tired.

37:30.921 --> 37:32.748
If the second half doesn't
get any better than this...

37:33.215 --> 37:35.208
you can expect
a full-scale riot.

37:35.676 --> 37:37.752
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is now time...

37:38.220 --> 37:41.803
for the Globetrotters' half-time
half-court heave-ho throw!

37:42.266 --> 37:43.808
If the contestant makes it...

37:44.268 --> 37:45.893
everyone here
will get a free pizza pie!

37:46.353 --> 37:48.512
I ain't taking the shot.
These people are crazy.

37:48.981 --> 37:51.602
Excuse me. I'll take that shot.

37:52.943 --> 37:55.316
What made you want to see
the Globetrotters today, son?

37:55.780 --> 37:58.235
I came for the beer
and the bitches.

38:01.118 --> 38:03.325
Look who's back from the dead.

38:03.788 --> 38:07.370
Six-six-six! Pickup sticks!

38:07.833 --> 38:10.503
Please welcome Miguel Sanchez
from the Bronx, New York!

38:10.961 --> 38:11.875
What's Nicky doing there?

38:12.338 --> 38:14.046
Trying to capture
his brother in a flask...

38:14.507 --> 38:16.795
and preserve the balance
of good and evil on Earth.

38:17.259 --> 38:19.750
-Did you just talk?
-No.

38:22.056 --> 38:25.472
-Are you Miguel from the Bronx?
-No. I'm Nicky from the South.

38:25.935 --> 38:27.346
Hey, give me that!

38:29.063 --> 38:30.261
You better win these people
some free pizza...

38:30.731 --> 38:32.771
because it looks like they're
about to kill each other.

38:33.234 --> 38:33.850
All right.

38:34.318 --> 38:36.062
Who's that man, Mommy?

38:37.363 --> 38:40.317
I don't know,
but he sure is butt-ugly.

38:40.783 --> 38:43.570
Release the evil.

38:48.541 --> 38:50.367
Too much evil.

38:50.835 --> 38:54.453
I think that ball just blew up,
and, yes, my hair is aflame.

38:54.922 --> 38:56.547
I don't know
what the Hell that was.

38:57.007 --> 38:59.712
-Don't do it again, huh?
-All right.

39:00.177 --> 39:04.673
I command you not to blow up
and go into that metal circle.

39:11.230 --> 39:13.139
Get that crap out of here!

39:14.358 --> 39:16.398
I know you're having fun,
Cassius...

39:16.861 --> 39:18.853
but you really got
to come back to Hell.

39:19.321 --> 39:23.070
Look around you, Nicky.
We're in Hell. The new Hell.

39:27.455 --> 39:29.743
Do it! Do it! Do it!

39:32.626 --> 39:34.500
I was sent here
to take you back...

39:34.962 --> 39:35.876
and that's what I'm going to do.

39:36.338 --> 39:38.960
Don't make me take out
the shovel again, Trick.

39:39.425 --> 39:42.379
I think we're about to see
a Devil showdown.

39:44.096 --> 39:46.255
Dad got sick when you guys left.

39:46.724 --> 39:48.218
I'm glad he's dying...

39:48.684 --> 39:51.804
because it's my turn now.

39:52.897 --> 39:54.973
You're going to wish
you never said that.

39:58.819 --> 40:00.563
Take him to the hole, Nicky.

40:01.030 --> 40:03.521
I mean, woof woof.

40:05.868 --> 40:08.157
Come on, brother, come on!

40:08.621 --> 40:10.329
Come on!

40:16.754 --> 40:19.838
Daddy can't help you!

40:32.144 --> 40:33.473
Enough!

40:35.314 --> 40:39.146
This show gets better
every year!

40:39.610 --> 40:41.982
That was sick.
Who taught you that shit?

40:42.446 --> 40:43.561
Sorry, Cassius.

40:44.031 --> 40:47.151
It must be the Super Devil Juice
Dad gave me.

40:47.618 --> 40:49.611
Super Devil Juice?
Give me that, little girl.

40:50.079 --> 40:51.359
Don't drink out of it, please!

40:59.922 --> 41:04.964
Now that was some straight-up
David Copperfield shit!

41:06.053 --> 41:07.251
Damn you, Nicky!

41:07.722 --> 41:09.631
There ain't no Super Devil Juice
in here!

41:10.099 --> 41:10.845
Hail, Nicky!

41:11.308 --> 41:14.179
We are forever your slaves!

41:20.109 --> 41:22.682
-So your father's the Devil.
-Sí, seòor.

41:23.154 --> 41:26.108
You're a talking dog from Hell.
You guys are who?

41:26.574 --> 41:29.444
A couple of big fans of Nicky
and the work his dad does.

41:29.910 --> 41:32.401
By the way, Nicky,
check this out.

41:37.793 --> 41:39.453
What's Ozzy trying to say there?

41:39.920 --> 41:41.545
John, absolutely nothing.

41:42.006 --> 41:44.331
The Blizzard always
came straight with his messages.

41:44.800 --> 41:48.134
But wrap your minds around this,
gentlemen.

41:51.432 --> 41:53.638
Chicago.

41:57.438 --> 41:59.976
I love this song.

42:01.400 --> 42:04.152
I command you
in the name of Lucifer...

42:04.612 --> 42:06.569
to spread the blood
of the innocent.

42:07.031 --> 42:10.281
Oh, my God, Chicago kicks ass!

42:11.368 --> 42:12.483
That was awesome.

42:12.953 --> 42:17.366
You know, guys,
this cake tastes a little funny.

42:17.833 --> 42:20.455
I dumped a fat sack of reefer
in the mix.

42:20.920 --> 42:22.829
Thought I'd spice up the bash.

42:23.297 --> 42:25.124
-Really?
-What's reefer?

42:25.591 --> 42:27.797
About five hundred bucks
an ounce.

42:41.816 --> 42:43.642
Come on, Nicky, one more time.

42:44.110 --> 42:45.818
I can't. It's starting to hurt.

42:46.278 --> 42:48.401
Come on, you totally got to!

42:48.864 --> 42:51.023
All right, all right. Last time.

42:51.492 --> 42:53.034
Here he goes!

42:59.417 --> 43:00.579
That's insane!

43:01.043 --> 43:04.080
How do you do that?

43:05.297 --> 43:08.049
I used to get messed up
like this...

43:08.509 --> 43:10.217
with my first girlfriend
Heather.

43:10.678 --> 43:14.972
We'd get so loopy,
she would forget I was a dog.

43:15.433 --> 43:18.268
-She was a human?
-No. A sewer rat.

43:19.562 --> 43:21.887
Man, that pissed my parents off.

43:22.356 --> 43:24.728
You know, I was in love once...

43:25.192 --> 43:26.817
but she said I wasn't
financially reliable...

43:27.278 --> 43:28.440
and she needed that.

43:28.904 --> 43:30.648
By "she," do you mean "he"?

43:31.115 --> 43:33.321
-No.
-Busted!

43:34.952 --> 43:35.901
Please.

43:36.370 --> 43:41.116
How you feeling over there,
Satan Abdul-Jabbar?

43:41.584 --> 43:43.292
A little strange.

43:43.753 --> 43:47.122
I can't stop thinking
about this girl Valerie.

43:47.590 --> 43:49.048
Why? Did she hurt you?

43:49.508 --> 43:51.300
Do you need to cry
on my shoulder?

43:51.761 --> 43:52.875
Easy, Liberace.

43:53.345 --> 43:55.053
Would you grow up?

43:55.514 --> 43:57.009
Liberace.

43:57.475 --> 43:58.885
I was having the best day
with her...

43:59.351 --> 44:02.934
until Adrian made me tell her
she had a heart-shaped heinie.

44:03.397 --> 44:05.354
Maybe you love her.
But what do I know?

44:05.816 --> 44:08.105
I can't even see straight.

44:10.279 --> 44:12.770
Me, too! We got to get going.

44:13.240 --> 44:15.814
You guys can crash here.
I have an extra futon.

44:16.285 --> 44:18.527
That's a big pass, Elton John.

44:20.122 --> 44:22.530
Ozzy starts in 30 minutes.
That'll cheer you up, Nicky.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.031
Yeah, let's roll.

44:24.502 --> 44:28.202
I can't give the Ozz man
the full focus he deserves.

44:28.672 --> 44:29.586
Sorry, fellas.

44:30.049 --> 44:33.169
This chick must be
the real deal, then.

44:33.636 --> 44:35.593
-Later, bro.
-Good-bye, John.

44:36.055 --> 44:37.383
-Good luck, Nicky.
-OK, Pete.

44:37.848 --> 44:40.470
You better snap out
of it soon, kid...

44:40.935 --> 44:43.011
because we're going
after Adrian tomorrow...

44:43.479 --> 44:45.721
bright and early.
Night-night.

44:46.190 --> 44:49.773
Yeah, I know.
Get some sleep thing, Mr Beefy.

45:01.497 --> 45:05.281
That is the most horrifying
thing I have ever seen.

45:10.798 --> 45:13.040
Go to her.

45:22.393 --> 45:23.935
All right.

45:26.772 --> 45:29.228
I smell coconuts.

45:32.820 --> 45:34.314
Coconuts.

45:47.835 --> 45:49.911
That dude looks like a lady.

45:50.379 --> 45:51.375
You want to come in?

45:51.839 --> 45:54.793
Actually, I'm looking
for a girl named Valerie.

45:55.259 --> 45:57.715
Valerie Veran?
Two floors up, one window over.

45:58.179 --> 45:58.925
Thanks much.

45:59.388 --> 46:01.048
Good luck
with the nipple rubbing.

46:01.515 --> 46:04.884
I don't need luck. I'm good.

46:05.352 --> 46:07.345
I can see that.

46:31.879 --> 46:33.587
Oh, my God!
Nicky, is that you?

46:34.048 --> 46:36.124
Stay right there.

46:36.592 --> 46:38.217
I will.

46:48.437 --> 46:50.346
What were you thinking
coming here?

46:50.815 --> 46:53.934
I don't know, but it didn't
involve going blind.

46:55.861 --> 46:56.976
Oh, my God! Nicky!

46:57.446 --> 46:59.320
Please don't die!

47:04.078 --> 47:05.738
What are you doing?

47:07.123 --> 47:09.411
I think I'm floating.

47:09.875 --> 47:12.366
Why would you be floating?

47:12.837 --> 47:16.122
Maybe it was because
of this cake I ate earlier.

47:16.590 --> 47:18.963
Am I supposed to not be
freaked out right now?

47:19.427 --> 47:20.173
Because I am.

47:20.636 --> 47:21.751
I'm freaked out, too.

47:22.221 --> 47:24.842
The butterflies in my stomach
are flapping around...

47:25.307 --> 47:27.977
in a way I've never felt before.

47:28.436 --> 47:30.345
You got the wrong window again,
man.

47:30.813 --> 47:32.521
Oh, sorry, Nipples. Valerie!

47:32.982 --> 47:35.188
-Nicky, over here.
-I'm coming.

47:35.651 --> 47:36.980
Oh, my God, you made it.

47:37.445 --> 47:41.063
Valerie, I can see again,
and you look beautiful.

47:42.825 --> 47:44.485
Just because you're floating...

47:44.952 --> 47:46.909
doesn't mean I'm going to forget
you giving me the finger.

47:47.371 --> 47:48.486
That wasn't me.

47:48.956 --> 47:51.114
I was being possessed
by my brother Adrian.

47:51.584 --> 47:52.663
What do you mean, possessed?

47:53.127 --> 47:55.914
Remember when I told you
that my father was in Hell?

47:56.380 --> 47:59.167
That's because he's the Devil...

47:59.633 --> 48:03.002
and he wants to keep his throne
for another 10,000 years.

48:03.471 --> 48:04.965
And that pissed off
my brothers...

48:05.431 --> 48:06.842
so they broke
the gates of Hell...

48:07.308 --> 48:11.008
which is making my father
decompose.

48:11.479 --> 48:15.808
I love my father very much,
so I came to Earth to save him.

48:17.151 --> 48:19.227
Now I get that Deep South joke.

48:23.115 --> 48:25.737
I don't know
if I should believe you.

48:26.202 --> 48:28.194
You got to believe.
Believe in the butterflies.

48:28.662 --> 48:31.035
Wait. OK. OK, OK, I believe.

48:31.499 --> 48:34.286
Come on. Come back up.

48:36.128 --> 48:38.702
Take my hand, Valerie.

48:41.384 --> 48:44.503
Fly with me.
I can give you the power.

48:52.144 --> 48:54.267
That's
the Empire State Building.

48:54.730 --> 48:57.933
There's Popeye's chicken--
right there.

48:58.401 --> 49:01.567
The Hell Beast is above us...

49:02.029 --> 49:04.947
and I can smell an evil slut.

49:06.325 --> 49:07.903
Whoa, Devil!

49:08.369 --> 49:09.234
Did you do that?

49:09.704 --> 49:12.373
Nobody calls my girl
an evil slut.

49:14.333 --> 49:15.329
Good morning, New York.

49:15.793 --> 49:17.121
This is an "Action News"
special report.

49:17.586 --> 49:18.582
A shocking crime...

49:19.046 --> 49:21.454
results in a record
fifty-million-dollar reward...

49:21.924 --> 49:23.383
for the capture of this man.

49:23.843 --> 49:24.957
His name is unknown...

49:25.428 --> 49:27.669
but his actions have earned him
the label "The Monster."

49:28.139 --> 49:30.594
He should be considered armed
and extremely dangerous.

49:31.058 --> 49:32.552
The man who caused
such a sensation...

49:33.018 --> 49:35.426
at the game yesterday
is no hero.

49:35.896 --> 49:38.304
He is, in fact, a mass murderer.

49:38.774 --> 49:40.981
-This is real bad.
-Where the heck is Nicky?

49:41.444 --> 49:42.475
I have authorized a reward...

49:42.945 --> 49:44.902
to the person
who brings this man to me.

49:45.364 --> 49:47.191
It's a setup.

49:49.618 --> 49:51.611
Good morning, young lady.

49:54.498 --> 49:56.705
That looks like it tastes great.

49:59.462 --> 50:00.078
Look at that.

50:00.546 --> 50:02.455
Mr Beefy would like you.

50:03.799 --> 50:05.293
Oh, look.

50:47.718 --> 50:48.749
There he is!

51:31.303 --> 51:32.846
Wait. Wait.

51:33.305 --> 51:34.468
What is happening?

51:37.309 --> 51:38.554
There he is!

51:41.313 --> 51:43.223
I'm not a monster.

51:48.863 --> 51:52.113
Release the evil.

52:22.646 --> 52:24.972
Beefy, I think I'm in trouble.

52:25.441 --> 52:26.852
The shit has hit the fan, kid.

52:27.318 --> 52:28.183
Take a look.

52:28.652 --> 52:29.981
This videotape
will show what he did...

52:30.446 --> 52:31.988
after he left the game.

52:33.032 --> 52:35.024
Say hello to my little friend.

52:37.536 --> 52:38.995
My name is Nicky...

52:39.455 --> 52:41.744
and I'm going to kill all
you suckers for no reason.

52:42.208 --> 52:45.327
That's not me! That's
that cockroach Tony Montana!

52:46.504 --> 52:48.876
-Difficult to watch, I know.
-This is Adrian's work.

52:49.340 --> 52:52.673
He superimposed your head
onto "Scarface."

52:53.135 --> 52:55.424
Which is probably DePalma's
third best film.

52:57.681 --> 52:58.630
I'm not Nicky.

52:59.100 --> 53:01.009
Dude, it's us. Let us in.

53:01.477 --> 53:03.719
-John! Pete!
-Nicky!

53:04.188 --> 53:05.896
There's a total mob scene
coming this way.

53:06.357 --> 53:08.930
It looks like they're following
a giant trail of bug shit.

53:09.402 --> 53:10.516
What do we do now, Beefy?

53:10.986 --> 53:12.646
I don't know. This is
a little out of my league.

53:13.114 --> 53:15.652
-What would your dad do, Nicky?
-That's a great idea!

53:16.117 --> 53:17.575
I'll ask him. Kill me.

53:18.035 --> 53:18.984
Are you serious?

53:19.453 --> 53:22.573
Yes. We'll meet
at Grand Central Station, noon.

53:23.040 --> 53:24.784
Now I command you--do me.

53:25.251 --> 53:26.247
All right!

53:31.590 --> 53:33.168
That just hurt a lot.

53:33.634 --> 53:34.583
Still alive, though.

53:35.052 --> 53:36.926
I've always wanted
to kill someone.

53:37.388 --> 53:39.096
Can I give it a try?

53:42.435 --> 53:45.519
Damn you, Kevin Spacey!

53:45.980 --> 53:49.100
You take all my parts!

53:50.568 --> 53:52.359
Hey, you lose--royal flush.

53:52.820 --> 53:53.733
Off with the brassiere.

53:54.196 --> 53:57.316
The last time I saw
a pair of jugs that big...

53:57.783 --> 53:59.527
two hillbillies
were blowing on them.

54:04.832 --> 54:06.990
Oh, my God, Dad.

54:07.460 --> 54:10.164
Nicky, I got no legs.

54:10.629 --> 54:11.828
I got no hips.

54:12.298 --> 54:13.757
I got one ear.

54:14.216 --> 54:15.046
I got no ears.

54:15.509 --> 54:17.549
Now he has no ears.
Are you happy, Nicky?

54:18.012 --> 54:20.218
Adrian's got the whole city
following me.

54:20.681 --> 54:21.962
I can't hear you, Nicky!

54:22.433 --> 54:23.844
Check one, two. Check one, two.

54:24.310 --> 54:25.223
Put it back on my head!

54:25.686 --> 54:28.224
You got until midnight tonight.

54:28.689 --> 54:32.188
Get your ass back up there,
and save your father. Go!

54:32.651 --> 54:34.858
-I'm going to save you, Dad.
-Go, go, go!

54:35.321 --> 54:37.563
-I'm going to save you!
-Go, then! Move it!

54:38.032 --> 54:39.277
Go, Nicky, go!

54:39.742 --> 54:40.940
Sure you're down with this?

54:41.410 --> 54:43.450
A little nervous. Want to puke.

54:44.455 --> 54:47.491
Hey, hey, fuzz.
We know where to find Nicky.

54:52.296 --> 54:53.921
-Let's go.
-Get in.

54:54.632 --> 54:55.545
What's up, Police Chief?

54:56.008 --> 54:58.416
-You have what I want.
-You got what we want?

54:58.886 --> 55:00.879
Fifty million bones, bro.

55:01.347 --> 55:02.971
-Here's the money.
-Whoa, my God!

55:03.432 --> 55:05.508
That's half of it. You get
the rest when I get Nicky.

55:05.976 --> 55:07.175
Thanks much.

55:07.645 --> 55:10.052
I got to warn you, man.
He's kind of not human.

55:10.523 --> 55:13.192
-Really?
-He might be the son of Satan.

55:21.700 --> 55:23.823
I guess I'll have to be
extra careful, then, aren't l?

55:24.286 --> 55:26.244
Now, where is he?

55:27.540 --> 55:29.248
Hey, come on, that was cool!

55:29.709 --> 55:30.871
Do it again!

55:36.257 --> 55:37.834
Out of the way!

55:42.346 --> 55:44.220
Where is he? He's late.

55:44.682 --> 55:46.674
He'll be here.
Just keep your skirt on.

55:47.143 --> 55:48.388
That's where he comes out of.

55:48.853 --> 55:50.228
Over there!

55:51.564 --> 55:52.726
We've been ratted out.

55:53.190 --> 55:56.144
We thought the son of Satan
would understand such a move.

55:56.610 --> 55:59.232
-Get these two out of here.
-All right, this way.

56:01.073 --> 56:03.529
What is this?
A bulldog and his gay lover?

56:03.993 --> 56:04.823
Oh, shut up.

56:05.286 --> 56:07.077
It's true. It's true.

56:07.538 --> 56:08.403
Judas.

56:08.873 --> 56:10.830
Judas Priest, maybe.

56:11.292 --> 56:13.783
I'm only an actor.
I don't know what's happening.

56:14.253 --> 56:16.411
Take him to the holding area.
Seal off all the exits.

56:16.881 --> 56:19.372
I'm only an actor!

56:21.177 --> 56:22.457
You want to see something cool?

56:22.928 --> 56:24.257
Definitely.

56:34.607 --> 56:36.480
Pick me a winner.

56:37.568 --> 56:38.943
Oh, sick!

56:39.403 --> 56:41.941
Oh, my God, that was awesome!

56:44.950 --> 56:47.904
So, what time's
my brother expected back?

56:48.371 --> 56:51.407
Noon. Ish.

56:51.874 --> 56:53.701
Even though you're
not really the chief...

56:54.168 --> 56:55.793
we still get the rest
of the cash, right, bro?

56:56.253 --> 56:57.629
You know what you'll get, boys?

56:58.089 --> 56:59.832
An indescribably
horrific torture...

57:00.299 --> 57:03.585
administered by demons
for the rest of eternity.

57:04.053 --> 57:05.595
And we get to keep the cash,
too, right?

57:06.055 --> 57:07.134
Sure.

57:07.598 --> 57:08.926
Why not?

57:09.392 --> 57:11.099
You're hurting me.

57:11.560 --> 57:12.723
Shut up.

57:23.280 --> 57:25.902
Applesauce every time.

57:26.367 --> 57:27.232
Hey, boys!

57:27.701 --> 57:29.860
You want a blizzard
with my flip-flop?

57:30.329 --> 57:33.283
No, thanks, but we'll take
that bottle of booze.

57:34.500 --> 57:35.959
Beat it, you freak.
Get out of here.

57:36.419 --> 57:38.791
I'll be back with my flip-flop!

57:43.092 --> 57:44.290
Schnapps.

57:47.555 --> 57:48.586
Peppermint?

57:49.056 --> 57:50.634
All right!

57:53.310 --> 57:54.390
Want a hit?

57:54.854 --> 57:58.139
Drink up.
Here's to fifty million clams.

57:58.607 --> 58:01.312
To the defilement of Earth
and corruption of its people.

58:01.777 --> 58:03.770
OK, whatever.
Just drink it.

58:04.238 --> 58:05.269
Cheers.

58:15.416 --> 58:17.954
It's awfully hot down here.

58:18.419 --> 58:22.286
How do you manage
to stay so cool?

58:24.300 --> 58:26.791
Beer lowers
the body temperature.

58:27.261 --> 58:31.045
I read that in a beer magazine.

58:32.433 --> 58:35.220
This liquid
will probably quench my thirst.

58:36.687 --> 58:38.514
-Cool me off.
-Definitely.

58:38.981 --> 58:41.306
Give you a pretty good buzz.

58:45.404 --> 58:48.738
Or maybe it will trap me inside
for all of eternity.

58:49.200 --> 58:51.869
No, it won't?

58:52.328 --> 58:55.993
Oh, Nicky.
I've missed you.

58:56.457 --> 58:58.331
Come out and say hello!

58:58.793 --> 59:00.251
I'm not Nicky.

59:00.711 --> 59:02.787
I'm calling you out, brother!

59:06.050 --> 59:09.585
Adrian, this is very painful.

59:24.527 --> 59:26.934
-There you are.
-I told you he was sick.

59:27.405 --> 59:28.567
Oh, hello, Cassius.

59:29.031 --> 59:30.490
All right, Adrian! Let me out!

59:30.950 --> 59:33.904
New Hell really only needs
one new Satan.

59:34.370 --> 59:35.781
You motherfu--

59:36.247 --> 59:39.366
But Cassius could use
some company for eternity.

59:40.501 --> 59:41.580
So get in the flask.

59:42.044 --> 59:43.242
Kick his ass, Nicky.

59:43.713 --> 59:44.459
Sleep.

59:44.922 --> 59:46.333
You got it.

59:50.845 --> 59:53.514
Hey, hold up.
Someone's got to take a pee.

59:56.642 --> 59:59.216
That dog's got smoke balls!

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:04.647
Run, Beefy! Run!

01:00:05.109 --> 01:00:06.733
You can't make me drink, Adrian.

01:00:07.194 --> 01:00:08.274
Of course I can.

01:00:12.992 --> 01:00:15.779
Oh, it's Nicky's
little ragamuffin.

01:00:16.245 --> 01:00:17.490
Drink or she dies.

01:00:17.955 --> 01:00:20.411
Unlike you, she won't come back
from where she's going.

01:00:23.419 --> 01:00:26.171
Let go of her!
This is between you and me!

01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:30.130
I hear a train a-coming!

01:00:31.635 --> 01:00:33.213
Adrian, stop!

01:00:33.679 --> 01:00:36.384
-Drink!
-All right! Don't hurt her!

01:00:37.558 --> 01:00:38.471
Don't do it, Nicky!

01:00:38.934 --> 01:00:40.761
I have to, Valerie.

01:00:53.783 --> 01:00:56.653
Now, that hurt the both of us.

01:01:09.382 --> 01:01:10.544
See you in Hell!

01:01:16.097 --> 01:01:18.932
Hey, look at the bright side.
You can go for a swim.

01:01:19.183 --> 01:01:22.184
You can play the harmonica,
and you can choke someone.

01:01:22.645 --> 01:01:24.721
Take me to my room.
I want to be alone!

01:01:25.189 --> 01:01:27.098
In your weakened condition,
if you vacate the throne...

01:01:27.566 --> 01:01:30.236
any of your sons can claim
the seat of power for their own.

01:01:30.694 --> 01:01:32.438
Horseshit.

01:01:32.905 --> 01:01:34.648
Hey, good news.
Adrian's back.

01:01:35.116 --> 01:01:36.444
I'm going to be all right?

01:01:38.411 --> 01:01:39.110
Where's Nicky?

01:01:39.578 --> 01:01:41.037
He came with you and Cassius,
right?

01:01:41.497 --> 01:01:42.991
I came through that gate alone.

01:01:43.457 --> 01:01:45.035
Sorry, sir. False alarm.

01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:48.085
Would everyone stop
playing with me...

01:01:48.546 --> 01:01:50.788
and tell me
what my brother's up to?

01:02:11.152 --> 01:02:12.978
What is this?

01:02:25.374 --> 01:02:27.948
Is it Dad's birthday?

01:02:36.427 --> 01:02:37.506
There he is.

01:02:37.970 --> 01:02:39.797
Hi! I can't believe you're here!

01:02:40.264 --> 01:02:41.094
Welcome.

01:02:41.557 --> 01:02:43.099
Up with the sign.

01:02:45.561 --> 01:02:47.637
Can I just tell you
I am so excited right now?

01:02:48.105 --> 01:02:50.394
-So excited!
-She really is.

01:02:50.858 --> 01:02:52.400
If you could point me
to the Black Palace...

01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:55.351
I really got to check in
with my dad.

01:02:57.573 --> 01:03:00.029
Can I ask you something?

01:03:00.493 --> 01:03:02.035
What do you know about your mom?

01:03:02.495 --> 01:03:03.775
My mom.

01:03:04.246 --> 01:03:07.532
My brothers tell me
that she was a mountain goat...

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.325
which would explain
my chronic halitosis.

01:03:10.795 --> 01:03:12.752
A mountain goat?
That's really sweet.

01:03:13.214 --> 01:03:14.328
Jenna, chair.

01:03:16.258 --> 01:03:17.421
Thanks.

01:03:18.886 --> 01:03:20.594
My mother wasn't a goat?

01:03:21.055 --> 01:03:22.929
Try an angel.

01:03:23.391 --> 01:03:26.641
An angel?

01:03:27.103 --> 01:03:28.348
I'm your mom.

01:03:31.399 --> 01:03:35.859
If you're my mom,
then how come you're not older?

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:38.277
Angels don't get any older, son.

01:03:38.739 --> 01:03:41.491
I can't believe
you just called him "son."

01:03:41.951 --> 01:03:44.276
This is so wild!

01:03:48.916 --> 01:03:51.917
Jenna, Christa.
Time for your mambo lesson.

01:03:52.378 --> 01:03:54.833
Chubbs, I'm so sorry.
I totally spaced.

01:03:55.297 --> 01:03:57.207
I have company.
This is my son Nicky.

01:03:59.593 --> 01:04:00.791
Chubbs used to be a golf pro...

01:04:01.262 --> 01:04:03.053
but up here he's just
the dopest dance instructor.

01:04:03.514 --> 01:04:04.344
Ah, that's nice.

01:04:04.807 --> 01:04:05.803
You mambo?

01:04:06.267 --> 01:04:07.216
I don't think so.

01:04:07.685 --> 01:04:10.437
It's all in the hips.

01:04:12.773 --> 01:04:14.980
-Bye, Chubbs.
-All in the hips, yeah!

01:04:15.443 --> 01:04:16.937
Nobody in this room
will tell you a thing, Adrian.

01:04:17.403 --> 01:04:18.482
Right!

01:04:19.530 --> 01:04:20.693
Hey, let him go!

01:04:22.158 --> 01:04:25.740
Perhaps a titty-twister
will loosen your lips.

01:04:27.413 --> 01:04:28.362
I'm getting turned on.

01:04:28.831 --> 01:04:31.156
All I know is that if you
sit on that throne...

01:04:31.625 --> 01:04:33.285
in your father's
weakened condition--

01:04:33.753 --> 01:04:34.452
Tit-head, no!

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:38.289
You can claim the seat of power
for your own.

01:04:40.134 --> 01:04:41.130
Really?

01:04:41.594 --> 01:04:42.922
As the founder of Hell...

01:04:43.387 --> 01:04:45.463
I command you
to stay off that throne!

01:04:47.349 --> 01:04:49.223
Even in Hell I get no respect.

01:04:49.685 --> 01:04:51.642
Put me down!

01:05:15.002 --> 01:05:16.959
So where did you meet Dad?

01:05:17.421 --> 01:05:20.506
It was a long time ago
at this Heaven-Hell mixer.

01:05:20.966 --> 01:05:23.504
I remember that night.
You had, like, four daiquiris.

01:05:23.969 --> 01:05:24.835
At first
I didn't really like him.

01:05:25.304 --> 01:05:27.712
-He was really conceited.
-But he was funny.

01:05:28.182 --> 01:05:31.099
And I hate to admit it,
but he had a really hot body.

01:05:33.229 --> 01:05:34.687
Puppy phone.

01:05:35.147 --> 01:05:37.140
It's so cute.

01:05:37.608 --> 01:05:39.850
Hi, Michelle.
Yeah, he's here right now.

01:05:40.319 --> 01:05:42.644
I don't know if he's hot.
He's my son, you perv.

01:05:43.114 --> 01:05:44.359
Can I call you back?

01:05:46.325 --> 01:05:48.033
That was my friend Michelle.
She says hi.

01:05:48.494 --> 01:05:49.869
Say hi back.

01:05:50.955 --> 01:05:51.904
I'll just call her later.

01:05:52.373 --> 01:05:54.946
We totally saw you
save your girlfriend's life.

01:05:55.418 --> 01:05:56.034
That was so cool.

01:05:56.502 --> 01:05:58.329
That's why you came to Heaven
instead of Hell.

01:05:58.796 --> 01:06:00.456
Self-sacrifice
automatically gets you here.

01:06:00.923 --> 01:06:01.954
How did you see me?

01:06:02.425 --> 01:06:05.342
We can see anything
that's going on on Earth. Look.

01:06:06.595 --> 01:06:07.793
Someone else is taking
the internship.

01:06:08.264 --> 01:06:10.506
That's "Felicity."
I love that show. Do you watch?

01:06:10.975 --> 01:06:13.264
I haven't seen it,
but I hear good things.

01:06:15.479 --> 01:06:17.353
This is an "Action News"
special report.

01:06:17.815 --> 01:06:20.935
Moments ago, a large chunk
of what appears to be Hell...

01:06:21.402 --> 01:06:23.774
began to rise
from beneath Central Park.

01:06:24.238 --> 01:06:25.981
Far from being terrified...

01:06:26.449 --> 01:06:28.441
many New Yorkers have begun
flocking to the site...

01:06:28.909 --> 01:06:31.531
turning it into an unofficial
party central.

01:06:31.996 --> 01:06:33.324
And this just in...

01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:37.289
I'm cheating on my husband
with the weatherman.

01:06:39.295 --> 01:06:40.706
Show him Central Park.

01:06:41.172 --> 01:06:42.547
I love your legs.

01:07:01.567 --> 01:07:03.607
That's my father's throne!

01:07:04.070 --> 01:07:05.943
-Is Dad OK?
-Let's see.

01:07:06.405 --> 01:07:08.362
I was a good Devil, wasn't l?

01:07:08.824 --> 01:07:10.983
You were the best Devil, sir!

01:07:11.452 --> 01:07:13.943
If we fall in there,
we will die. Period.

01:07:14.413 --> 01:07:17.165
My underwear is so far up my ass
I could taste it.

01:07:17.625 --> 01:07:18.455
I hear that.

01:07:18.918 --> 01:07:22.121
Welcome to the party!

01:07:25.049 --> 01:07:27.919
It's so nice
to see you all here.

01:07:28.386 --> 01:07:30.627
I'm so proud of you.

01:07:31.097 --> 01:07:34.845
You've taken to sin
with such minimal prompting.

01:07:37.812 --> 01:07:41.097
You're acting as if
there is no Heaven or Hell.

01:07:45.111 --> 01:07:47.187
Well, I've got news for you.

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:54.400
There is most definitely a Hell.

01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:55.652
What?

01:07:56.122 --> 01:07:59.241
And you're all
going there when you die.

01:07:59.709 --> 01:08:02.959
Which is in about
fifteen minutes.

01:08:03.421 --> 01:08:06.256
Holy shit,
we really are going to die!

01:08:13.305 --> 01:08:15.298
I'm really burning now!

01:08:15.766 --> 01:08:17.344
What are we going to do?

01:08:17.810 --> 01:08:19.269
I got to help her.

01:08:19.729 --> 01:08:21.435
I got to help Dad.

01:08:21.897 --> 01:08:23.640
I got to help everybody.

01:08:24.108 --> 01:08:25.057
At the stroke of midnight...

01:08:25.526 --> 01:08:28.231
my father will be
completely deteriorated...

01:08:28.696 --> 01:08:31.863
and all your souls will be mine.

01:08:32.323 --> 01:08:33.653
Soon you will see things...

01:08:34.118 --> 01:08:36.194
more horrible
than you can even imagine.

01:08:39.165 --> 01:08:42.912
Well, maybe not that horrible,
but still pretty bad.

01:08:44.336 --> 01:08:45.712
So, while we wait...

01:08:46.171 --> 01:08:47.500
for your enjoyment...

01:08:47.965 --> 01:08:50.087
I bring you a dear, sweet man--

01:08:50.551 --> 01:08:53.089
Mr Henry Winkler.

01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:55.212
Good evening.

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:57.389
Covered in bees!

01:09:02.479 --> 01:09:03.854
How can I win?

01:09:04.314 --> 01:09:07.350
Adrian is stronger
and smarter than me.

01:09:07.818 --> 01:09:08.564
Stronger, yes.

01:09:09.028 --> 01:09:10.652
Smarter, definitely.

01:09:11.113 --> 01:09:12.987
But you have something
that he doesn't have.

01:09:13.448 --> 01:09:15.691
A speech impediment?

01:09:17.203 --> 01:09:18.578
The inner light, honey.

01:09:19.037 --> 01:09:20.412
And you can totally use it.

01:09:20.872 --> 01:09:23.446
-It's the best power of all.
-I do?

01:09:23.917 --> 01:09:26.872
And God told me if you
get in really bad trouble...

01:09:27.337 --> 01:09:28.712
you can use this.

01:09:29.173 --> 01:09:30.881
What is it?

01:09:31.341 --> 01:09:32.884
I'm not totally
a hundred percent on that...

01:09:33.344 --> 01:09:36.013
but God said when the time came,
you'd know what to do with it.

01:09:36.471 --> 01:09:37.337
God's so smart.

01:09:37.807 --> 01:09:39.430
Like "Jeopardy!" smart.

01:09:42.853 --> 01:09:43.635
My little boy.

01:09:44.104 --> 01:09:46.774
Mommy,
get me to the Big Apple...

01:09:47.233 --> 01:09:50.399
because I'm going to
rock that town like a hurricane.

01:09:50.861 --> 01:09:52.189
You're already there.

01:09:52.654 --> 01:09:53.651
Bye, Nicky.

01:09:54.115 --> 01:09:55.525
Bye, Mom.

01:09:55.991 --> 01:09:57.450
Bye, guys.

01:10:09.505 --> 01:10:11.663
Release the good.

01:10:20.433 --> 01:10:22.639
Yes, they're furry.

01:10:23.102 --> 01:10:24.929
Bunny, bunny, bunny!

01:10:25.396 --> 01:10:27.554
Release the awesome.

01:10:31.318 --> 01:10:33.774
What you do is put it
in your mouth...

01:10:34.238 --> 01:10:38.366
and let the meat slide down
your throat hole.

01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:41.781
Not you, not you!

01:10:45.875 --> 01:10:48.792
Popeye's chicken
is the shizzney!

01:11:09.231 --> 01:11:11.604
You know, from this angle,
you're kind of cute.

01:11:12.068 --> 01:11:13.266
You think so?

01:11:15.154 --> 01:11:16.103
Oh, my God.

01:11:16.572 --> 01:11:18.814
He just opened his mouth
and swallowed that spit.

01:11:19.283 --> 01:11:22.118
That turn you on there, RuPaul?

01:11:28.542 --> 01:11:30.618
Excuse me. Pardon me.

01:11:31.712 --> 01:11:33.372
Little Nicky.

01:11:35.383 --> 01:11:36.462
I knew you would make it!

01:11:36.926 --> 01:11:40.259
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely.

01:11:40.721 --> 01:11:43.010
Let my friends alone...

01:11:43.474 --> 01:11:45.467
and get in the flask.

01:11:45.935 --> 01:11:46.717
Is this a joke?

01:11:47.186 --> 01:11:48.811
No, it's the inner light...

01:11:49.271 --> 01:11:51.976
and with it,
we can defeat whatever you got.

01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:53.686
It's true!

01:11:57.571 --> 01:11:59.114
It's not true!

01:12:01.325 --> 01:12:03.697
Run, traitors, run!

01:12:04.161 --> 01:12:05.490
OK, Adrian.

01:12:05.955 --> 01:12:08.706
You've left me no choice.

01:12:21.971 --> 01:12:23.513
Leave this to me.

01:12:24.765 --> 01:12:26.674
Let's see what you've got.

01:13:12.354 --> 01:13:13.599
Enough!

01:13:16.442 --> 01:13:17.901
I'm going to kill you
with my bare hands.

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:19.641
I'm ready for you.

01:13:20.905 --> 01:13:22.648
I guess I wasn't ready.

01:13:36.462 --> 01:13:38.455
-I totally had to do that.
-Hell, yeah!

01:13:38.923 --> 01:13:39.836
-Good job!
-That's great!

01:13:40.299 --> 01:13:41.710
Thanks, Mom !

01:13:48.557 --> 01:13:51.013
I'm going to ask you nicely.

01:13:51.477 --> 01:13:53.386
Get in the fla--

01:13:53.854 --> 01:13:56.641
You want a pillow fight, do you?

01:13:57.108 --> 01:13:59.599
Let's let the feathers fly.

01:14:01.153 --> 01:14:02.398
Come on, now.

01:14:05.783 --> 01:14:07.063
Come on.

01:14:09.745 --> 01:14:12.034
I'm right here.
Where am I going with it, baby?

01:14:12.498 --> 01:14:13.529
Here I am.

01:14:17.211 --> 01:14:18.409
I'm sleeping.

01:14:18.879 --> 01:14:20.042
Or am l?

01:14:24.218 --> 01:14:25.048
Thanks, Mr Winkler.

01:14:25.511 --> 01:14:27.800
I'm asking you one last time.

01:14:28.264 --> 01:14:30.303
Get in the flask.

01:14:30.766 --> 01:14:32.640
A little help here, please.

01:14:35.312 --> 01:14:35.893
Please!

01:14:36.355 --> 01:14:38.977
Don't do this! No!

01:14:45.156 --> 01:14:46.401
Good-bye, Nicky.

01:14:56.208 --> 01:14:57.489
Nice to see you, brothers.

01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.751
Now I'm going to bust
both of your heads wide open!

01:15:06.844 --> 01:15:08.504
-Come on!
-Get 'em, Nicky!

01:15:08.971 --> 01:15:09.967
Come on, Nicky!

01:15:10.431 --> 01:15:14.298
You can do it, Nicky!
Kick him in his hairy balls!

01:15:14.769 --> 01:15:16.227
Good idea.

01:15:18.522 --> 01:15:19.637
One down, one to go, Adrian.

01:15:20.107 --> 01:15:22.016
You've asked for this.
Time for the shovel!

01:15:22.485 --> 01:15:24.358
Bring it on!

01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:26.979
-Kill him, Adrian!
-Shut up!

01:15:27.448 --> 01:15:29.405
-Get him, Nicky!
-Let go of me!

01:16:01.357 --> 01:16:04.393
How did a nice Southern boy
learn to fight like that?

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:07.861
I guess from my father's side
of the family.

01:16:23.546 --> 01:16:26.879
What? No tongue?

01:16:34.807 --> 01:16:36.087
Catch me if you can!

01:16:36.559 --> 01:16:37.721
That is wicked!

01:16:44.191 --> 01:16:46.184
Not long now!

01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:49.979
You got to fly out.

01:16:50.448 --> 01:16:51.823
Soon it will all be mine!

01:16:52.283 --> 01:16:54.156
Nicky! I know you can do it.

01:16:54.618 --> 01:16:55.614
Run, run!

01:16:56.078 --> 01:16:57.454
Do it for the butterflies.

01:16:57.913 --> 01:16:59.538
Butterflies?

01:17:04.462 --> 01:17:07.581
The power of good
lets you fly out.

01:17:08.049 --> 01:17:09.507
Well, you're too late, Nicky!

01:17:11.385 --> 01:17:14.303
Behold your new Satan!

01:17:15.473 --> 01:17:18.011
What's that?
What's with the ball?

01:17:23.105 --> 01:17:25.228
-Ozzy?
-Holy shit.

01:17:26.609 --> 01:17:28.897
No, no, no!

01:17:29.361 --> 01:17:30.772
You can do it, Ozzy!

01:17:31.238 --> 01:17:33.361
Bite his fricking head off!

01:17:36.535 --> 01:17:37.733
Spit him in the flask!

01:17:38.204 --> 01:17:39.235
Here you go, Ozzy.

01:17:44.752 --> 01:17:47.290
-Grand Central, Nicky!
-Start running.

01:17:47.755 --> 01:17:49.000
-You'll never make it.
-You've got to die.

01:17:49.465 --> 01:17:50.580
I'll just go to Heaven.

01:17:51.050 --> 01:17:53.588
Not if you do something bad
right before you die.

01:17:54.053 --> 01:17:54.918
You're right.

01:17:55.388 --> 01:17:57.179
Hey, Nicky!
Cover Winkler in bees!

01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:58.838
You can do it!

01:18:00.267 --> 01:18:02.094
Sorry, Henry.

01:18:04.355 --> 01:18:05.932
-Do me!
-With what?

01:18:06.399 --> 01:18:07.347
I don't know.

01:18:07.817 --> 01:18:10.023
Here. Kill him with this.

01:18:11.570 --> 01:18:13.065
I'll never forget you, guys.

01:18:13.531 --> 01:18:17.065
And we will never forget you,
my friend.

01:18:23.290 --> 01:18:25.164
I love you.

01:18:25.626 --> 01:18:28.082
And I love you, Nicky.

01:18:36.429 --> 01:18:39.798
I got them, Dad! I did it!

01:18:42.476 --> 01:18:45.394
Unholiness, you're back!

01:18:46.605 --> 01:18:47.981
You look great!

01:18:48.441 --> 01:18:49.935
It's all in the hips

01:18:50.401 --> 01:18:52.358
It's in the hips

01:18:55.322 --> 01:18:56.521
You're all right!

01:18:56.991 --> 01:18:58.189
You came through, Nicky.

01:18:58.659 --> 01:19:00.201
I came through for you, Dad...

01:19:00.661 --> 01:19:04.160
and I came through
for Mom and the butterflies.

01:19:04.623 --> 01:19:06.415
You're back in Hell now, kid.

01:19:06.876 --> 01:19:08.453
There are no butterflies here.

01:19:08.919 --> 01:19:11.493
If you want butterflies,
you need to be on Earth.

01:19:11.964 --> 01:19:17.837
What about you and Grandpa
and everybody in Hell?

01:19:18.304 --> 01:19:21.922
I let my butterflies die
once upon a time...

01:19:22.391 --> 01:19:24.431
and it's never stopped hurting.

01:19:24.894 --> 01:19:25.973
That's right!

01:19:26.437 --> 01:19:27.765
You heard me, Holly.

01:19:28.230 --> 01:19:29.012
What?

01:19:29.482 --> 01:19:30.892
I'm still in love with you!

01:19:31.358 --> 01:19:33.018
Oh, my God,
he's talking about me.

01:19:33.486 --> 01:19:36.440
And don't think I forgot
about how crazy you get...

01:19:36.906 --> 01:19:38.982
after a few daiquiris.

01:19:41.660 --> 01:19:44.330
That guy is still
the biggest horndog.

01:19:44.789 --> 01:19:46.069
Yeah, he is.

01:19:47.416 --> 01:19:49.492
Listen, I got down low.

01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:52.796
Your mom's got up high.

01:19:53.255 --> 01:19:54.666
You take care of the middle.

01:19:55.132 --> 01:19:56.924
OK, Dad.

01:19:57.385 --> 01:20:01.465
But, in the words
of Motley Crue...

01:20:01.931 --> 01:20:05.763
this will always be
my home sweet home.

01:20:06.227 --> 01:20:07.851
Don't be afraid
to show your face.

01:20:08.312 --> 01:20:10.352
You're such a handsome boy.

01:20:13.067 --> 01:20:14.775
I hate to interrupt...

01:20:15.236 --> 01:20:17.608
but it's time
for Hitler's punishment.

01:20:18.072 --> 01:20:19.899
-I'll take that.
-Maybe they'll let us out.

01:20:20.366 --> 01:20:21.196
Grandpa!

01:20:21.659 --> 01:20:22.857
OK, kids.

01:20:23.327 --> 01:20:24.952
Enjoy your new home!

01:20:26.914 --> 01:20:29.619
Holy shnit!

01:20:38.634 --> 01:20:40.923
Such a little angel.

01:20:42.304 --> 01:20:43.419
Only a quarter, ma'am.

01:20:44.890 --> 01:20:46.717
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

01:20:48.561 --> 01:20:49.889
Sorry.
