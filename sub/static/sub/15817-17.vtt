01:33.994 --> 01:35.863
PART ONE STARTED OFF WITH

01:35.863 --> 01:37.165
A BANG.

01:37.165 --> 01:38.299
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE WHAT PART

01:44.405 --> 01:45.439
SEASON THAT RASHEEDA WAS

01:45.439 --> 01:47.308
EXPECTING, BUT WHAT WE DIDN'T

01:47.308 --> 01:49.443
EXPECT WAS KIRK'S REACTION

01:49.443 --> 01:50.678

01:50.678 --> 01:53.414
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

01:53.414 --> 01:54.382
I'M PREGNANT.

I HAVE MILLION OTHER THINGS

01:55.549 --> 01:56.484
ON MY MIND LIKE,

01:56.484 --> 01:57.518
"THIS IS NOT JOY.

01:57.518 --> 01:58.319
THIS IS NOT PLEASURE.

01:58.319 --> 01:59.720
THIS IS--THIS IS A SETBACK

01:59.720 --> 02:00.521

02:00.521 --> 02:01.755
I'VE BEEN TAKING IT OUT.

02:01.755 --> 02:03.056
MAN, TAKING OUT WAS IN

02:03.056 --> 02:03.957

02:03.957 --> 02:04.825
LET'S TOAST TO THE PULL-OUT

02:08.496 --> 02:10.498

02:10.498 --> 02:11.199

02:11.199 --> 02:11.832
YEAH, YOU NEED TO GET

02:11.832 --> 02:12.500

02:12.500 --> 02:13.301
AND YOU'RE MAKING ME THINK

02:13.301 --> 02:14.001
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG

02:14.001 --> 02:14.668
WITH YOU.

02:14.668 --> 02:15.436
WELL, I SAID IT.

02:15.436 --> 02:16.237
I THINK YOU NEED TO LEAVE.

02:16.237 --> 02:18.672

02:18.672 --> 02:19.740
NO AUDIENCE REACTION ON

02:19.740 --> 02:20.874

THEY'RE STUNNED.

02:22.210 --> 02:22.943
I MEAN...

02:22.943 --> 02:23.777
WHAT KIND OF A HUSBAND TELLS

02:23.777 --> 02:26.580
HIS WIFE TO HAVE AN ABORTION?

02:26.580 --> 02:27.815
IT WAS THE TIMING.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.850
IT WAS--RASHEEDA WAS ON

02:29.850 --> 02:30.684
THE ROAD.

02:30.684 --> 02:31.619
RASHEEDA WAS WORKING ON

02:31.619 --> 02:32.553

02:39.293 --> 02:41.462
AS A GROWN MAN, THAT PULLING OUT

02:41.462 --> 02:43.464
WAS AN ACCEPTABLE FORM OF

02:43.464 --> 02:44.131
BIRTH CONTROL?

02:44.131 --> 02:44.965
I DEFINITELY DID.

02:44.965 --> 02:45.633
YEAH, I THOUGHT I--

02:45.633 --> 02:47.335
OKAY, THAT'S CRAZY.

IT'S CRAZY.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.571
NUMBER ONE, FOR YOU TO SIT THERE

02:50.571 --> 02:52.573

02:55.976 --> 02:57.044

02:57.044 --> 02:58.111
THE DAY, IT'S LIKE, "COME ON.

02:58.111 --> 02:59.146
THIS IS A BLESSING."

02:59.146 --> 03:00.281
AND YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY

03:00.281 --> 03:01.882
REGARDLESS IF YOU FEEL "REALLY,

03:01.882 --> 03:03.116
REALLY GREAT ABOUT IT AT THAT

03:03.116 --> 03:03.984
VERY MOMENT."

03:03.984 --> 03:04.952
IT'S LIKE [bleep] THINGS DON'T

03:04.952 --> 03:06.254
ALWAYS FALL INTO PLACE LIKE

03:06.254 --> 03:07.020
YOU WANT THEM TO, BUT IN

03:07.020 --> 03:08.889
A MARRIAGE, YOU DEAL, AND YOU

03:08.889 --> 03:10.358
COMPROMISE WITH IT.

03:10.358 --> 03:11.058
[applause]

03:11.058 --> 03:12.593
OKAY, LISTEN.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.262
MIDLIFE CRISIS OR NOT, KIRK'S

03:15.629 --> 03:17.064

03:18.466 --> 03:20.434
LET'S WATCH THE TAPE.

03:20.434 --> 03:21.602
I WANT TO GO BACK TO THINGS

03:21.602 --> 03:23.304
I DID WHEN I WAS 21.

03:23.304 --> 03:24.705
THAT'S JUST WHAT'S ON MY MIND:

03:24.705 --> 03:26.274
"JUST DO WHAT'S GONNA MAKE

03:26.274 --> 03:27.475
KIRK HAPPY."

03:27.475 --> 03:28.141
HOW FAR YOU WANT TO GO

03:28.141 --> 03:28.809
WITH THIS?

03:28.809 --> 03:29.510
I GOT A PASS.

03:29.510 --> 03:30.444
LIKE, I CAN LEAVE; I CAN DO

03:30.444 --> 03:31.279

03:32.446 --> 03:33.747
LET'S HAVE SOME FUN.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.015
RIGHT NOW, THE BACHELOR LIFE,

03:35.015 --> 03:36.384
I'M REALLY FEELING IT.

03:36.384 --> 03:39.287
KIRK MOTHER[bleep] FROST.

03:39.287 --> 03:40.554
DOUBLE OR NOTHING.

03:40.554 --> 03:41.289
KIRK, YOU WENT FROM

03:41.289 --> 03:42.290
THE PULL-OUT ASSASSIN TO

03:42.290 --> 03:43.757
MY HERO LAST NIGHT.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.058
CHICKS IN THE JACUZZI.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.394
MAN, YOU'RE GOING HOME TO

03:46.394 --> 03:48.095
A TSUNAMI, EARTHQUAKE.

03:48.095 --> 03:49.297
YOU GOT ALL THE ELEMENTS, KIRK,

03:49.297 --> 03:52.300
FOR A REAL SITUATION.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.200
[audience jeers]

03:53.200 --> 03:54.034
KIRK, YOU'RE SITTING HERE

03:54.034 --> 03:54.702
LAUGHING.

03:54.702 --> 03:55.369
THERE'S NOTHING FUNNY

03:55.369 --> 03:56.036
ABOUT THAT.

03:56.036 --> 03:56.837
WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT?

03:56.837 --> 03:58.038
ESPECIALLY SITTING RIGHT HERE

03:58.038 --> 03:58.706
IN RASHEEDA'S FACE.

03:58.706 --> 03:59.373
WELL, NO, IT'S NOT--

03:59.373 --> 04:00.308
IT'S BAD ENOUGH THAT YOU DID

04:00.308 --> 04:01.108
IT WHEN SHE WASN'T AROUND, BUT

04:01.108 --> 04:01.975
NOW YOU'RE SITTING IN HER FACE.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.311
FIRST OF ALL, THAT SITUATION

04:03.311 --> 04:04.312
HAPPENED WHEN RASHEEDA--ME AND

04:04.312 --> 04:05.979
RASHEEDA HAVING MULTIPLE

04:05.979 --> 04:07.748
ARGUMENTS THAT Y'ALL DIDN'T

04:07.748 --> 04:08.949
COVER, AND THE ONES THAT YOU DID

04:08.949 --> 04:09.950
SEE, SHE WAS LIKE,

04:09.950 --> 04:10.751
"GET THE EFF OUT.

04:10.751 --> 04:11.719
GET THE [bleep] OUT.

04:11.719 --> 04:12.486
GET AWAY FROM ME.

04:12.486 --> 04:13.321
DO YOU."

04:13.321 --> 04:14.688
SO THAT WAS A PASS TO GO OUT

04:14.688 --> 04:15.623
AND CHEAT ON YOUR WIFE.

04:15.623 --> 04:16.324
DEFINITELY.

04:16.324 --> 04:16.957
NO.

04:16.957 --> 04:17.791
SHE SAID, "DO WHAT YOU WANT

04:17.791 --> 04:18.459
TO DO."

04:18.459 --> 04:19.126
REALLY?

04:19.126 --> 04:19.860
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED

04:19.860 --> 04:20.528
TO DO.

04:20.528 --> 04:21.329
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

04:21.329 --> 04:22.095
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED TO DO?

04:22.095 --> 04:22.930
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANTED

04:22.930 --> 04:24.765
TO DO, BUT I FOUND MYSELF RIDING

04:24.765 --> 04:26.800
BIKES, HANGING WITH BENZINO,

04:26.800 --> 04:27.668
CLEARING MY MIND.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.136
IT KEPT ME FROM THINKING ABOUT

04:29.136 --> 04:30.471
THE NEGATIVE THINGS THAT WAS

04:30.471 --> 04:31.405
GOING ON IN MY LIFE.

04:31.405 --> 04:32.440
IT WAS A WAY FOR ME TO FREE

04:32.440 --> 04:33.374
MY MIND.

04:33.374 --> 04:34.174
ALL RIGHT, WELL, HOLD ON

04:34.174 --> 04:35.008
TO THAT THOUGHT, 'CAUSE,

04:35.008 --> 04:36.076
RASHEEDA, HOW HARD WAS IT FOR

04:36.076 --> 04:37.244
YOU TO WATCH THAT?

04:37.244 --> 04:38.011
REAL HARD.

04:38.011 --> 04:39.246
I MEAN, COME ON, LET'S BE REAL.

04:39.246 --> 04:40.147
LIKE, OKAY--

WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER

04:42.983 --> 04:44.352
17 1/2 YEARS.

04:44.352 --> 04:45.018
WOW.

04:45.018 --> 04:45.986
WHOO!

04:45.986 --> 04:46.654
WE'VE BEEN MARRIED

04:46.654 --> 04:47.355
FOR 13 YEARS.

04:47.355 --> 04:48.188
AND TO SEE ANOTHER WOMAN

04:48.188 --> 04:49.189
KISSING ON HIM AND TO SEE--

04:49.189 --> 04:50.924
I MEAN, OF COURSE YOU FEEL--

04:50.924 --> 04:53.060

04:53.060 --> 04:55.629
READY TO KILL HIS ASS, AND

04:55.629 --> 04:57.798
I JUST--EMBARRASED, AND THEN,

04:57.798 --> 04:58.899
YOU KNOW, I'M SITTING HERE

04:58.899 --> 04:59.867
TRYING TO BE LIKE, "OKAY,

04:59.867 --> 05:01.635
RASHEEDA, YOU KNOW, COMPOSE

05:01.635 --> 05:03.036
YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU PREGNANT

05:03.036 --> 05:03.804
AS HELL."

05:03.804 --> 05:04.805
AND I'M SITTING HERE THINKING

05:04.805 --> 05:06.139
THAT MY FRIEND, MY HUSBAND

05:06.139 --> 05:07.608

05:07.608 --> 05:08.642
CRAZY [bleep] LIKE THAT,

05:08.642 --> 05:10.110

05:10.110 --> 05:11.512
"DAMN, YOU CAN'T PUT [bleep]

05:11.512 --> 05:13.180
PAST NOBODY."

05:13.180 --> 05:14.114
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

05:14.114 --> 05:14.915
IT'S LIKE--

05:14.915 --> 05:15.583

05:18.686 --> 05:20.187

05:20.187 --> 05:21.822
IF YOU FELT LIKE THE "DO YOU"

05:21.822 --> 05:23.391
WAS A PASS FOR YOU TO GO AND DO

05:23.391 --> 05:24.191
[bleep] LIKE YOU'RE 21

05:24.191 --> 05:25.393
WITH BENZINO--

05:25.393 --> 05:26.794
YOU'RE GUILTY BY ASSOCIATION AS

05:26.794 --> 05:27.828
FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.

05:27.828 --> 05:28.896
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU,

05:28.896 --> 05:31.264
BENZINO, BECAUSE YOU, YOU KNOW,

05:31.264 --> 05:32.566
LED HIM TO WATER OR, SHOULD I

05:32.566 --> 05:34.502
SAY, THE JACUZZI HOT TUB,

05:34.502 --> 05:35.403
YOU KNOW, AND I KNOW YOU'RE

05:35.403 --> 05:36.203
GONNA SAY, "WELL, I DIDN'T MAKE

05:36.203 --> 05:37.438
HIM DRINK IT," BUT HOW MUCH

05:37.438 --> 05:38.906
RESPONSIBILITY DO YOU TAKE FOR

05:38.906 --> 05:40.641
YOUR ROLE IN THIS SITUATION?

05:40.641 --> 05:42.042
YOU KNOW, WATCHING THE--

05:42.042 --> 05:43.043
WATCHING THE EPISODE, YOU KNOW

05:43.043 --> 05:44.144
WHAT I'M SAYING, HURT ME.

05:44.144 --> 05:45.513
YOU KNOW, LIKE, WHEN I WATCHED

05:45.513 --> 05:46.580

05:46.580 --> 05:47.314

05:48.048 --> 05:49.282

05:51.051 --> 05:51.852

06:03.230 --> 06:04.231

06:04.231 --> 06:04.998
YES.

06:04.998 --> 06:05.766
OKAY.

06:05.766 --> 06:06.700
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S GOOD.

06:06.700 --> 06:07.601
BUT ON A REALISTIC NOTE,

06:07.601 --> 06:09.937
IT'S REALLY NOT HIS FAULT.

06:09.937 --> 06:10.604
RIGHT.

06:10.604 --> 06:11.271
YOU KNOW?

06:11.271 --> 06:12.005
IT'S KIRK'S FAULT.

06:12.005 --> 06:12.840
I SAID IT WASN'T HIS FAULT.

06:12.840 --> 06:13.607
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING,

06:13.607 --> 06:15.308
BECAUSE REGARDLESS TO THE FACT

06:15.308 --> 06:17.310
OF WHATEVER THE CASE WAS, WHEN

06:17.310 --> 06:19.647
A HUSBAND AND A WIFE HAVE

06:19.647 --> 06:20.948
A BIG-TIME BLOWOUT IN THEIR

06:20.948 --> 06:22.450
RELATIONSHIP, WHICH PEOPLE DO

06:22.450 --> 06:23.584
ALL THE TIME--BUT YOU DON'T SIT

06:23.584 --> 06:25.285
THERE, AND YOU DON'T SAY, "OKAY,

06:25.285 --> 06:27.354
SHE SAID 'DO YOU,' SO I FINNA

06:27.354 --> 06:28.522
GO AND LAY AROUND WITH ANY

06:28.522 --> 06:29.957
RANDOM BITCH I SEE."

06:29.957 --> 06:31.024
AND THAT SHOW ME THAT YOU AIN'T

06:31.024 --> 06:31.859
ABOUT [bleep].

06:31.859 --> 06:32.793
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT

06:32.793 --> 06:33.894
TO RASHEEDA?

06:33.894 --> 06:35.362
I TOLD RASHEEDA, "LISTEN,

06:35.362 --> 06:37.364
NOBODY'S LOOKING AT

06:37.364 --> 06:38.231
MY SITUATION."

06:38.231 --> 06:39.967
WHAT--WHAT IS YOUR SITUATION?

06:39.967 --> 06:41.034
LOOK, ME AND YOU ARE FRIENDS.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.035
WE GOT A FRIENDSHIP.

06:42.035 --> 06:43.236
I KNOW WE MARRIED, AND I KNOW

06:43.236 --> 06:43.971
WE WORK TOGETHER.

06:43.971 --> 06:44.772
WE GOT A FRIENDSHIP.

06:44.772 --> 06:46.173
IF I TELL YOU, "LOOK, I'M IN

06:46.173 --> 06:47.741
A LOST PLACE, AND I NEED YOUR

06:47.741 --> 06:49.342

06:49.342 --> 06:50.744
THIS LIKE, "YO, I'M FINDING

06:50.744 --> 06:52.480
MYSELF IN A WEIRD-ASS PLACE,"

06:52.480 --> 06:54.247
AND I'M BEING HONEST ABOUT IT.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.248
SHE AIN'T GOT TIME.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.349
SHE GOT TO DO HER INTERVIEWS.

06:56.349 --> 06:57.250
SHE GOT TO GO ON THE ROAD.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.251
SHE GOT TO DO THIS; SHE GOT TO

06:58.251 --> 06:59.152
GO DO THAT.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.187
SO YOU'RE SAYING YOU NEEDED

07:00.187 --> 07:01.489
YOUR WIFE, AND SHE WASN'T THERE

07:01.489 --> 07:02.155
FOR YOU?

07:02.155 --> 07:03.023
AND SHE WASN'T REALLY THERE.

07:03.023 --> 07:03.957
AND THEN YOU WENT OUT AND GOT

07:03.957 --> 07:05.493
WITH THE NEXT ONE.

07:05.493 --> 07:06.527
CLASSIC STORY.

07:06.527 --> 07:07.628
[both talking at once]

07:07.628 --> 07:08.328
YOU THINK THAT ANSWERS

07:08.328 --> 07:09.096
THE QUESTION, THE PROBLEM.

07:09.096 --> 07:09.930
I'M NOT SAYING THAT--

07:09.930 --> 07:10.598
THAT I WENT AND GOT WITH

07:10.598 --> 07:11.264
THE NEXT ONE.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.165
I'M JUST TELLING YOU THAT WAS

07:12.165 --> 07:13.233
ONE OF THE ISSUES.

07:13.233 --> 07:15.268
SO HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF

07:15.268 --> 07:16.904
THE SHOE WAS ON THE OTHER FOOT?

07:16.904 --> 07:18.305
LET'S JUST PLAY THE GAME AND

07:18.305 --> 07:19.573
REVERSE IT AND SEE HOW YOU

07:19.573 --> 07:22.510
WOULD FEEL.

07:22.510 --> 07:23.410
I MEAN, WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T

07:23.410 --> 07:24.077
BE TOGETHER.

07:24.077 --> 07:24.812
OF COURSE WE WOULDN'T.

07:24.812 --> 07:25.713
SO THEN THAT ANSWERS

07:25.713 --> 07:26.747
THE QUESTION ON WHY I TALKED

07:26.747 --> 07:27.748
TO A LAWYER.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.683
all: OOH.

07:29.683 --> 07:30.618

07:31.351 --> 07:32.586
I MEAN, IT'S NOT A FINALIZED

07:32.586 --> 07:34.522

07:34.522 --> 07:35.122
THAT I'M DEFINITELY--

07:35.122 --> 07:35.923
YOU'RE CONSIDERING IT.

07:35.923 --> 07:36.890
THAT I'VE CONSIDERED.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.191
OKAY, THIS IS SOME--THIS IS

07:38.191 --> 07:39.927
SOME VERY REAL STUFF, AND WE

07:39.927 --> 07:41.294
ACTUALLY HAD A QUESTION THAT

07:41.294 --> 07:43.063
I WANTED TO ASK BECAUSE I KNOW

07:43.063 --> 07:44.064
THAT I'VE HEARD OVER AND

07:46.433 --> 07:47.968

10:50.984 --> 10:53.453
[bleep] WHACK-ASS BITCH?

10:53.453 --> 10:54.154
BITCH, YOU COULD'VE

10:54.154 --> 10:54.822
WALKED AWAY.

10:54.822 --> 10:55.789
WALK AWAY?

10:55.789 --> 10:56.890
BITCH, I AIN'T NEVER THE ONE

10:56.890 --> 10:58.625
TO WALK THE [bleep] AWAY!

10:58.625 --> 10:59.492
BITCH, I AIN'T NO

10:59.492 --> 11:00.761
WALK-AWAY-ASS BITCH.

11:00.761 --> 11:01.862
MIMI.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.196
EVERYBODY THINKS I'M ANGRY.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.799
I'M A VERY HAPPY KIND OF BITCH.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.100
[laughter]

11:07.100 --> 11:07.901
MIMI.

11:07.901 --> 11:10.738
[applause]

11:10.738 --> 11:12.172
CRAZY.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.106
ARE YOU A VERY HAPPY KIND

11:13.106 --> 11:13.774
OF BITCH?

11:13.774 --> 11:14.507
YES.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.375
'CAUSE AFTER WATCHING THAT,

11:15.375 --> 11:16.043
CAN YOU REALLY SAY YOU

11:16.043 --> 11:16.744
WEREN'T ANGRY?

11:16.744 --> 11:17.878
I HAD REASON TO BE ANGRY.

11:17.878 --> 11:18.746
WHEN YOU GOT A REASON TO BE

11:18.746 --> 11:19.880
ANGRY, YOU ANGRY, BUT OTHER THAN

11:19.880 --> 11:20.948
THAT, I'M A REAL HAPPY KIND

11:20.948 --> 11:21.849
OF BITCH.

11:21.849 --> 11:22.916
ALL RIGHT.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.217
BUT, ARIANE, SHE PRETTY MUCH GOT

11:24.217 --> 11:26.820
UPSET HALF THE SEASON HERE.

11:26.820 --> 11:27.755
both: SHE DID.

11:27.755 --> 11:28.555
AND RIGHTFULLY SO.

11:28.555 --> 11:29.289
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN HER

11:29.289 --> 11:29.957
THAT WAY?

11:29.957 --> 11:30.858
ALL THE TIME.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.760
I FEEL THE WRATH OF EVERYTHING.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.061
SO SHE KNOWS I'MA BE RIGHT HERE,

11:34.061 --> 11:34.762
AND I'M THE ONE.

11:34.762 --> 11:35.495
OH, YOU WERE RIGHT THERE.

11:35.495 --> 11:36.496
AND I'M GONNA BE THERE.

11:36.496 --> 11:37.164
SHE WAS RIGHT UP IN

11:37.164 --> 11:37.965
YOUR FACE; YOU DID NOT MOVE.

11:37.965 --> 11:38.766
ALWAYS, ALWAYS.

11:38.766 --> 11:39.767
BUT, MIMI, WHAT'S UP WITH

11:39.767 --> 11:40.768
THE TALKING UP IN THE FACE?

11:40.768 --> 11:42.235
I--I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND

11:42.235 --> 11:42.936
AND HEAR WHAT THE [bleep]

11:42.936 --> 11:43.771
I'M SAYING.

11:43.771 --> 11:44.504
ALL RIGHT.

11:44.504 --> 11:45.839
DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU PLAY

11:45.839 --> 11:47.007
A PART IN WHY MIMI'S ALWAYS

11:47.007 --> 11:47.674
SO ANGRY?

11:47.674 --> 11:48.408
I DO, AND I WANTED TO TALK

11:48.408 --> 11:49.076
TO HER.

11:49.076 --> 11:49.877
OH, YOU WANT TO TALK TO HER?

11:49.877 --> 11:50.543
YEAH.

11:50.543 --> 11:51.211
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO

11:51.211 --> 11:51.879
SAY, STEVIE?

11:51.879 --> 11:52.579
I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE.

11:52.579 --> 11:53.246
ALL RIGHT.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.114
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING, AND

11:54.114 --> 11:54.882
I'D LIKE TO ASK WHAT I CAN DO

11:54.882 --> 11:56.016
TO MAKE IT EASIER SO WE CAN

11:56.016 --> 11:56.984
RAISE OUR DAUGHTER IN

11:56.984 --> 11:59.152
A PEACEFUL LIGHT.

11:59.152 --> 11:59.987
OH, MY GOD.

11:59.987 --> 12:03.623
[applause]

12:03.623 --> 12:05.458
JUST BE HONEST.

12:05.458 --> 12:06.126
BE REAL.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.227
TELL THE [bleep] TRUTH.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.295
STOP LYING.

12:08.295 --> 12:09.329
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.263
NO, YOU HAVEN'T.

12:10.263 --> 12:11.231
[sighs]

12:11.231 --> 12:12.432
YOU REALLY HAVEN'T.

12:12.432 --> 12:13.433
DON'T SAY YOU'RE GONNA DO

12:13.433 --> 12:14.501
SOMETHING AND TURN AROUND AND DO

12:14.501 --> 12:15.235
SOMETHING ELSE.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.169
I DO EVERYTHING I SAID I WAS

12:16.169 --> 12:16.837
GONNA DO.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.271
NO, YOU DON'T.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.206
YOU DO EVERYTHING YOU SAY

12:19.206 --> 12:20.073
YOU'RE GONNA DO, BUT THEN YOU DO

12:20.073 --> 12:20.808
A WHOLE LOT MORE--

12:20.808 --> 12:22.109
THEN YOU THROW IT IN MY FACE,

12:22.109 --> 12:23.176
AND YOU DO THIS AND THAT

12:23.176 --> 12:23.844
AND THE THIRD.

12:23.844 --> 12:24.577
THANKS, MONA, YEAH.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.245
SORRY.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.213
I ALSO WANT TO SAY SOMETHING

12:26.213 --> 12:26.880
TO YOU.

12:26.880 --> 12:27.680
OKAY, COOL.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.483
YOU AND I ARE NO LONGER.

12:30.483 --> 12:31.684
YOU ARE IN ANOTHER RELATIONSHIP,

12:31.684 --> 12:33.120
AND I RESPECT THAT.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.422
I JUST WANT WHAT--YOU AND YOUR

12:35.422 --> 12:37.624
RELATIONSHIP TO UNDERSTAND

12:37.624 --> 12:39.392
AND RESPECT WHAT WE HAVE.

12:39.392 --> 12:40.293
I'M YOUR DAUGHTER'S MOTHER.

12:40.293 --> 12:40.961
I'M ALWAYS GONNA BE YOUR

12:40.961 --> 12:41.628
DAUGHTER'S MOTHER.

12:41.628 --> 12:42.529
YOU'RE--AND YOU'RE MY FRIEND

12:42.529 --> 12:43.363

12:43.363 --> 12:44.031
I'M SAYING?

12:44.031 --> 12:44.832
AND I'M YOUR FRIEND TOO.

12:44.832 --> 12:45.565
AND I WANT THAT--I WANT MY

12:45.565 --> 12:46.233
FRIEND BACK TOO.

12:46.233 --> 12:47.167
YOUR FRIEND HAS ALWAYS

12:47.167 --> 12:47.835
BEEN HERE.

12:47.835 --> 12:49.136
I'VE NEVER LEFT.

12:49.136 --> 12:50.838
YOUR FRIEND'S NEVER LEFT.

12:50.838 --> 12:51.504
DO YOU ACCEPT HIS

12:51.504 --> 12:54.842
APOLOGY, MIMI?

12:54.842 --> 12:55.843
NO, I DON'T.

12:55.843 --> 12:58.145
I DON'T FEEL IT'S SINCERE, ONE,

12:58.145 --> 12:59.446
AND HE'S APOLOGIZED TIME AND

12:59.446 --> 13:00.848
TIME AGAIN, BUT IT'S THE SAME

13:00.848 --> 13:01.882
OLD BULL[bleep] TIME AND TIME

13:01.882 --> 13:02.950
AGAIN, SO...

13:02.950 --> 13:03.650
WHOO!

13:03.650 --> 13:04.551
[applause]

13:04.551 --> 13:07.354
I KNOW.

13:07.354 --> 13:08.455
WELL, JOSELINE, IT SOUNDS

13:08.455 --> 13:10.023
LIKE MIMI IS TRYING TO RESPECT

13:10.023 --> 13:11.024
THE RELATIONSHIP THAT YOU AND

13:11.024 --> 13:12.425
STEVIE HAVE, AND SHE'S ASKING

13:12.425 --> 13:13.626
FOR THE SAME IN RETURN.

13:13.626 --> 13:14.627
DO YOU THINK THAT THAT'S

13:14.627 --> 13:15.762
SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN GIVE HER?

13:15.762 --> 13:16.663
I WOULD HAVE--I HAVEN'T

13:16.663 --> 13:17.898
THE CHOICE BUT TO RESPECT HER,

13:17.898 --> 13:18.866
JUST LIKE I HAVE TO RESPECT ALL

13:18.866 --> 13:20.367
THE OTHER BABY MOM, AND I WANT

13:20.367 --> 13:21.634
HER TO GIVE IT IN RETURN.

13:21.634 --> 13:22.936
AND LIKE SHE SAID, HE NEEDS TO

13:22.936 --> 13:24.304
JUST KEEP IT REAL, AND EVERYBODY

13:24.304 --> 13:26.539
KNOWS STEVIE'S A [bleep] LIAR.

13:26.539 --> 13:27.274
HE LIES FOR NO REASON.

13:27.274 --> 13:28.141
I USED TO BE.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.209
OH, WHATEVER, STEVIE.

13:29.209 --> 13:30.510
HE ALWAYS LIE.

13:30.510 --> 13:31.778
WELL, STEVIE, YOU ARE

13:31.778 --> 13:33.446
THE OLD MAN IN MIMI'S LIFE...

13:33.446 --> 13:34.147
YEAH.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.382
BUT WE ALSO MET THE NEW MAN

13:35.382 --> 13:36.383
IN MIMI'S LIFE THIS SEASON.

13:36.383 --> 13:37.117
[laughs]

13:37.117 --> 13:38.218
A BLAST FROM HER PAST

13:38.218 --> 13:39.452
NAMED NIKKO.

13:39.452 --> 13:40.520
BUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP TOOK

13:40.520 --> 13:42.189
A LICKING WHEN THE WATCH NIKKO

13:42.189 --> 13:44.024
GAVE MIMI KEPT A-TICKING.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.558

13:47.227 --> 13:47.895
WHOO!

13:47.895 --> 13:50.230
THAT WAS HARD.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.532
A REAL ROLLIE DON'T TICKTOCK.

13:52.532 --> 13:53.233
TAKE A LOOK.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.168
THAT WAS HARD.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.904
AN OLD FRIEND, NIKKO, CAME

13:56.904 --> 13:58.038
BACK INTO MY LIFE.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.206
WE STARTED DATING A FEW

13:59.206 --> 14:02.709
MONTHS AGO, AND I'M LOVING IT

14:02.709 --> 14:03.543
RIGHT NOW.

14:03.543 --> 14:04.912
I TOLD MIMI THE OTHER NIGHT,

14:04.912 --> 14:05.645

14:11.919 --> 14:12.619
I'M MAKING YOU THE STAR

14:12.619 --> 14:13.286

14:13.286 --> 14:14.054
THANK YOU, BABY.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.022
DON'T BE MAD BECAUSE YOUR

14:15.022 --> 14:15.923
CO-PILOT IS GAY.

14:15.923 --> 14:16.723
NO, I JUST WANT YOU TO

14:16.723 --> 14:17.390
LEAVE, THOUGH.

14:17.390 --> 14:18.091

14:18.091 --> 14:18.758

14:18.758 --> 14:19.659

14:21.761 --> 14:23.296

14:24.797 --> 14:26.433
THIS VIDEO, HE SAID I WOULD BE

14:26.433 --> 14:28.035
THE LEADING LADY, BUT LEADING

14:28.035 --> 14:30.003
LADIES GET MORE THAN TWO SECONDS

14:30.003 --> 14:30.971
ON THE SCREEN.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.973
WHAT DO YOU FEEL, AS MY FRIEND,

14:32.973 --> 14:34.341
ABOUT MY RELATIONSHIP?

14:34.341 --> 14:36.409
I FEEL LIKE HE'S

14:36.409 --> 14:38.445
UNAUTHENTIC SOMETIMES.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.847
THIS IS WHAT I GOT FOR YOU.

14:40.847 --> 14:42.249

14:46.286 --> 14:47.154
DIAMONDS FOR YOU.

14:47.154 --> 14:48.788
IT'S TICKING, THOUGH.

14:48.788 --> 14:50.823
A REAL ROLLIE DON'T TICKTOCK,

14:50.823 --> 14:51.491

14:51.491 --> 14:52.659
ONLY A FAKE CAT WILL GIVE

14:52.659 --> 14:53.760
A FAKE ROLLIE.

14:53.760 --> 14:54.761
I REALLY TRIED TO MAKE THIS

14:54.761 --> 14:56.096
WORK, BUT AT THIS POINT, I'M

14:56.096 --> 14:57.965

21:43.370 --> 21:46.038
BENZINO, IF WHAT KARLIE WAS

21:54.614 --> 21:55.648
SHE SMASHED THE HOMIE?

21:55.648 --> 21:56.616
WELL, I MEAN, I HAD ALREADY

21:56.616 --> 21:57.484
DID THE SONG.

21:57.484 --> 21:59.218
WHEN I WENT TO MIAMI FOR

21:59.218 --> 22:02.188
MEMORIAL WEEKEND, THAT'S WHEN

22:07.594 --> 22:08.260
YEAH, THAT'S HER.

22:08.260 --> 22:08.928

22:08.928 --> 22:09.629

22:09.629 --> 22:10.296

22:10.296 --> 22:11.163
WHAT DO YOU THINK, JOSELINE?

22:11.163 --> 22:11.864
DOES SHE LOOK LIKE YOU?

22:11.864 --> 22:12.532
HELL [bleep] NO.

22:12.532 --> 22:13.265
THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT--

22:13.265 --> 22:13.933

22:18.137 --> 22:19.305

22:19.305 --> 22:20.407
SO LET ME ASK YOU THIS, STEVIE.

22:20.407 --> 22:21.441

22:23.776 --> 22:25.277
DID YOU BELIEVE THAT BENZINO WAS

22:25.277 --> 22:26.579
EVEN CAPABLE OF THIS?

22:26.579 --> 22:28.047
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T

22:28.047 --> 22:29.315
REALLY THINK TOO MUCH OF IT,

22:37.223 --> 22:38.825

22:38.825 --> 22:40.960
KARLIE'S KNOWN TO BE MESSY.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.194
SO, KARLIE, DID HE SHOW YOU

22:56.943 --> 22:58.445
WAS SHE LYING, BENZINO?

22:58.445 --> 22:59.479
I MEAN, I'VE NEVER SEEN NO

23:14.794 --> 23:15.462
NO, NO, NO.

23:15.462 --> 23:16.228
WAIT A MINUTE, HE DIDN'T

23:16.228 --> 23:17.163
SMASH THE HOMIE.

23:17.163 --> 23:18.097
I DIDN'T SAY I SMASHED

23:18.097 --> 23:18.865

23:18.865 --> 23:19.799
I DIDN'T SAY I SMASHED

23:19.799 --> 23:20.500

26:54.246 --> 26:55.715
THE MARRIAGE.

26:55.715 --> 26:56.548
NOTHING'S EVER ENOUGH

26:56.548 --> 26:57.216
FOR HER.

26:57.216 --> 26:58.150
I'M GONNA MARRY THIS LADY

26:58.150 --> 27:00.452
RIGHT HERE, AND I JUST SEE

27:00.452 --> 27:01.888
A LOT OF NEGATIVITY, YOU KNOW

27:01.888 --> 27:03.589
WHAT I'M SAYING?

27:03.589 --> 27:05.825
BY PROPOSING TO ERICA, MY SON

27:05.825 --> 27:07.694
IS MAKING THE BIGGEST MISTAKE

27:07.694 --> 27:08.560
OF HIS LIFE.

27:08.560 --> 27:10.262
SHE DON'T KNOW HER PLACE,

27:10.262 --> 27:11.163
AND THAT'S WHERE THE ERROR IS

27:11.163 --> 27:11.998
RIGHT NOW.

27:11.998 --> 27:12.799
OH, WHOA, WHOA.

27:12.799 --> 27:15.802
[all shouting]

27:15.802 --> 27:18.805
[both yelling indistinctly]

27:19.471 --> 27:20.139
GO GET IN THE CAR.

27:20.139 --> 27:20.807
GO GET IN THE--

27:20.807 --> 27:21.473
GO GET IN THE CAR.

27:21.473 --> 27:22.541
GET THE [bleep] OUT MY HOUSE!

27:22.541 --> 27:24.043
TAKE HER OUT MY HOUSE!

27:24.043 --> 27:26.012
[bleep] DISRESPECTFUL.

27:26.012 --> 27:27.046
YOU FEEL ME?

27:27.046 --> 27:27.947
STOP, STOP, STOP!

27:27.947 --> 27:28.948
AND SHE HIT MY--

27:28.948 --> 27:30.416
STOP, STOP!

27:30.416 --> 27:31.751
MOMMA, GET IN THE CAR.

27:31.751 --> 27:33.720
LET THE [bleep] RIDE.

27:33.720 --> 27:34.854
THAT INSENSITIVE BITCH,

27:34.854 --> 27:36.522
ERICA, HAD TO STRIKE AGAIN,

27:36.522 --> 27:37.724
HER AND HER MAMA.

27:37.724 --> 27:39.926
SMOKE A STRAIGHT SHOOTER, BITCH.

27:39.926 --> 27:40.793
HEY, MAN.

27:40.793 --> 27:41.560
YOU BETTER GET YOUR HANDS

27:41.560 --> 27:42.261
OFF ME, SCRAP.

27:42.261 --> 27:43.129
DON'T TOUCH MY MAMA.

27:43.129 --> 27:43.930
THAT MOTHER[bleep]

27:43.930 --> 27:45.331
GODDAMN BITCH.

27:45.331 --> 27:48.334
[all yelling indistinctly]

27:53.239 --> 27:54.406
TALKING ABOUT YOU IS A PIMP.

27:54.406 --> 27:55.141
THAT'S A HO.

27:55.141 --> 27:56.508
BITCH, I'LL KICK YOUR ASS.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.410
HE A PUNK LIKE HIS PUNK MAMA.

27:58.410 --> 28:00.112
DIE, BITCHES, DIE!

28:00.112 --> 28:01.480
HE GOING TO HELL.

28:01.480 --> 28:03.515
OH, MY GOD, ALL RIGHT.

28:03.515 --> 28:04.884
LET'S START WITH A FAN QUESTION.

28:04.884 --> 28:06.552
THIS ONE'S TO YOU, ERICA.

28:06.552 --> 28:08.054
"DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE WRONG

28:08.054 --> 28:09.388
FOR GOING OFF ON MOMMA DEE

28:09.388 --> 28:10.189
AT THE FAMILY DINNER?"

28:10.189 --> 28:11.523
ABSOLUTELY NOT, 'CAUSE WHAT

28:11.523 --> 28:13.525
YOU DIDN'T SEE WAS ERICA BEING

28:13.525 --> 28:15.828
CALLED A BITCH AGAIN.

28:15.828 --> 28:16.796
IT DIDN'T FULLY COME OUT,

28:16.796 --> 28:17.663
BECAUSE SCRAP SAID,

28:17.663 --> 28:18.397
"MA, HOLD ON."

28:18.397 --> 28:19.065
MOMMA DEE.

28:19.065 --> 28:19.766
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

28:19.766 --> 28:20.399
OKAY.

28:20.399 --> 28:22.168
I NEVER CALLED HER A BITCH.

28:22.168 --> 28:23.836
HE CHECKED IT, AND THEN ALL OF

28:23.836 --> 28:24.771
A SUDDEN, SHE JUST CAME FROM

28:24.771 --> 28:25.772
NOWHERE AND--

28:25.772 --> 28:26.773
SO YOU WERE JUST AT THE TABLE

28:26.773 --> 28:27.473
ALL CALM.

28:27.473 --> 28:28.674
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

28:28.674 --> 28:29.475
NO, I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING

28:29.475 --> 28:30.542
AT FIRST.

28:30.542 --> 28:31.210
OKAY.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.378
AT FIRST, I DIDN'T.

28:32.378 --> 28:33.312
BUT AT THIS POINT,

28:33.312 --> 28:34.280
THEY WERE ENGAGED.

28:34.280 --> 28:35.647
SCRAPPY HAD MADE HIS DECISION.

28:35.647 --> 28:36.883
WHY NOT JUST ACCEPT IT?

28:36.883 --> 28:37.784
I DON'T HAVE TO ACCEPT

28:37.784 --> 28:39.118
ANYTHING I DON'T LIKE.

28:39.118 --> 28:41.087
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

28:41.087 --> 28:42.321
ALL RIGHT, WELL...

28:42.321 --> 28:43.089
[scattered laughter]

28:43.089 --> 28:45.892
MIGNON, YOU ACTUALLY CALLED IT

28:45.892 --> 28:46.558
EARLY ON.

28:46.558 --> 28:47.626
DID YOU EVER ACTUALLY THINK

28:47.626 --> 28:48.694
THESE TWO WOULD GET MARRIED

28:48.694 --> 28:49.361
FOR REAL?

28:49.361 --> 28:51.831
AT FIRST, I DIDN'T, AND THEN

28:51.831 --> 28:53.365
THE MORE RELATIONSHIP WENT ON,

28:53.365 --> 28:55.234
THE MORE I SEEN THEM TOGETHER,

28:55.234 --> 28:56.668
I FELT THAT IT WOULD HAVE

28:56.668 --> 28:58.204
HAPPENED IF MOMMA DEE WOULD STAY

28:58.204 --> 28:59.305
IN MOMMA DEE'S PLACE.

28:59.305 --> 29:00.306
SO SHE NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND SHE

29:00.306 --> 29:01.640
NOT GONNA DISRESPECT US.

29:01.640 --> 29:02.909
I'M NOT GONNA GO FOR IT.

29:02.909 --> 29:04.143
I SAID THAT FOR A LONG TIME.

29:04.143 --> 29:04.811
[cheers and applause]

29:04.811 --> 29:07.013
[speaking indistinctly]

29:07.013 --> 29:08.714
I SAID THAT FOR A LONG TIME.

29:08.714 --> 29:09.882
IF YOU CALL YOURSELF A QUEEN,

29:09.882 --> 29:10.883
ACT LIKE A QUEEN.

29:10.883 --> 29:13.853
[both speaking indistinctly]

29:13.853 --> 29:14.887
YOU ACT LIKE TRASH, YOU GONNA

29:14.887 --> 29:16.588
BE KNOWN AS TRASH.

29:16.588 --> 29:17.890
YOU'RE A PROBLEM TO US,

29:17.890 --> 29:19.225
AND YOU'RE A PROBLEM TO ME,

29:19.225 --> 29:20.192
AND I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO

29:20.192 --> 29:21.393
KNOW WHY.

29:21.393 --> 29:22.361
SOLVE IT.

29:22.361 --> 29:23.963
ALL RIGHT, SO, MOMMA DEE,

29:23.963 --> 29:24.696
THIS QUESTION'S ACTUALLY

29:24.696 --> 29:25.364
FOR YOU.

29:25.364 --> 29:26.332
IT'S A FAN QUESTION FROM CHERYL

29:26.332 --> 29:27.934
D., WHO WANTS TO KNOW, "DO YOU

29:27.934 --> 29:29.301
THINK YOU WENT TOO FAR WHEN YOU

29:29.301 --> 29:31.103
TOLD MIGNON TO SMOKE

29:31.103 --> 29:32.471
A STRAIGHT SHOOTER?"

29:32.471 --> 29:34.306
I THINK I DID.

29:34.306 --> 29:35.407
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EXACTLY?

29:35.407 --> 29:36.475
IT'S A CRACK PIPE.

29:36.475 --> 29:37.209
OKAY.

29:37.209 --> 29:38.077
AND WE ALL KNOW THAT

29:38.077 --> 29:38.744
MIGNON HAS--

29:38.744 --> 29:39.545
MIGNON IS A RECOVERING

29:39.545 --> 29:40.212
ADDICT.

29:40.212 --> 29:41.580
I GOT 11 YEARS CLEAN.

29:41.580 --> 29:42.448
HOW ABOUT HER?

29:42.448 --> 29:44.050
[cheers and applause]

29:44.050 --> 29:45.417
MM-HMM, MM-HMM.

29:45.417 --> 29:46.318
WHATEVER.

29:46.318 --> 29:49.021
I CAN'T--I CAN'T--

29:49.021 --> 29:50.022
ALL RIGHT, WELL, SCRAPPY,

29:50.022 --> 29:50.857
THE MOTHERS MAY HAVE PLAYED

29:50.857 --> 29:51.924
A ROLE, BUT ERICA SAID THAT

29:51.924 --> 29:52.724
THERE WERE TEXTS FROM

29:52.724 --> 29:53.559
OTHER WOMEN.

29:53.559 --> 29:54.460
MM-HMM.

29:54.460 --> 29:55.527
TELL THE TRUTH.

29:55.527 --> 29:56.695
WERE YOU CHEATING ON ERICA AFTER

29:56.695 --> 29:57.396
YOU GUYS GOT ENGAGED?

29:57.396 --> 29:58.064
NO.

29:58.064 --> 29:59.031
ERICA, DO YOU BELIEVE HIM?

29:59.031 --> 29:59.866
NO, NO, NOT AT ALL.

29:59.866 --> 30:00.632
SHE NEVER BELIEVED ME.

30:00.632 --> 30:01.567
WHY WOULD YOU ASK SOMEBODY--

30:01.567 --> 30:02.501
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF ANY

30:02.501 --> 30:03.235
OF THESE WOMEN THAT WERE

30:03.235 --> 30:03.903
TEXTING HIM?

30:03.903 --> 30:04.703
DID YOU KNOW WHO THEY WERE?

30:04.703 --> 30:05.504
YUP, IT WAS ONE OF HIS EXES

30:05.504 --> 30:06.973
HE HAD JUST SEEN.

30:06.973 --> 30:08.040
DANA WAS ONE OF HIS HOMEBOY'S

30:08.040 --> 30:09.241
BABY MAMA.

30:09.241 --> 30:09.909
all: OOH.

30:09.909 --> 30:10.776
SO...

30:10.776 --> 30:11.443
DOES THAT RING

30:11.443 --> 30:12.211
A BELL, SCRAPPY?

30:12.211 --> 30:13.345
OKAY, SINCE WE GONNA DO IT

30:13.345 --> 30:14.580
LIKE THAT, ERICA'S NOT

30:14.580 --> 30:15.747
A PERFECT PERSON.

30:15.747 --> 30:16.748
I NEVER SAID I WAS.

30:16.748 --> 30:18.450
NO, BUT SCRAPPY NEVER AIRS

30:18.450 --> 30:19.351
OUT ERICA.

30:19.351 --> 30:20.486
SCRAPPY NEVER AIRS OUT ERICA

30:20.486 --> 30:22.088
DYSFUNCTIONAL SITUATION.

30:22.088 --> 30:23.055
WHAT'S MY DYSFUNCTIONAL

30:23.055 --> 30:24.523
SITUATION?

30:24.523 --> 30:25.391
DON'T DO THAT, SCRAPPY.

30:25.391 --> 30:26.158
PLEASE DON'T.

30:26.158 --> 30:26.926
SOMEBODY HUSBAND SHE WAS

30:26.926 --> 30:27.593
DEALING WITH.

30:27.593 --> 30:28.527
ARE YOU SAYING--YOU AIN'T--

30:28.527 --> 30:29.761
REALLY?

30:29.761 --> 30:30.529
I WAS MESSING WITH

30:30.529 --> 30:31.530
SOMEBODY'S HUSBAND?

30:31.530 --> 30:32.798
IS THAT WHAT YOU GONNA DO?

30:32.798 --> 30:33.465
COME ON, GIRL.

30:33.465 --> 30:34.133
IS THAT WHAT YOU--

30:34.133 --> 30:34.800
OKAY, YOU RIGHT.

30:34.800 --> 30:36.268
THE TRUTH WILL SPEAK FOR ITSELF.

30:36.268 --> 30:37.336
HEY, YOU GONNA WHIP ME?

30:37.336 --> 30:38.137
YOU GONNA WHIP ME?

30:38.137 --> 30:38.971
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU--

30:38.971 --> 30:39.838
YOU'RE THROWING UP SMOKE

30:39.838 --> 30:41.340
SCREENS RIGHT NOW, SCRAPPY.

30:41.340 --> 30:42.508
WELL, THERE IS ANOTHER WOMAN

30:42.508 --> 30:44.010
BESIDES MOMMA DEE WHO DIDN'T

30:44.010 --> 30:45.244
BELIEVE ERICA WAS THE RIGHT ONE

30:45.244 --> 30:46.678
FOR SCRAPPY, AND THAT WAS

30:46.678 --> 30:48.180
SHAY JOHNSON.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.348
LET'S BRING HER UP.

30:49.348 --> 30:50.182
COME HERE, BABY.

30:50.182 --> 30:51.450
[audience jeers]

30:51.450 --> 30:54.053
[scattered applause]

30:54.053 --> 30:54.720
HEY, BABY.

30:54.720 --> 30:57.156
HI.

30:57.156 --> 30:58.324
SO, SHAY--

30:58.324 --> 30:59.926
I'M NOT A PART OF THAT.

30:59.926 --> 31:01.961
YES, YOU ARE.

31:01.961 --> 31:02.661
DON'T DO THAT.

31:02.661 --> 31:03.996
I JUST WANT TO--LIKE, 'CAUSE

31:03.996 --> 31:04.931
WHERE I'M AT RIGHT NOW, I'M IN

31:04.931 --> 31:06.165
A GOOD SPACE IN MY LIFE.

31:06.165 --> 31:06.933
YOU FEEL ME?

31:06.933 --> 31:07.733
QUIT TEXTING ME.

31:07.733 --> 31:09.001
LEAVE ME ALONE.

31:09.001 --> 31:10.002
ARE YOU STILL TEXTING ERICA?

31:10.002 --> 31:11.170
HELL YEAH.

31:11.170 --> 31:11.938
YOU STILL TRYING TO GET

31:11.938 --> 31:12.538

31:13.205 --> 31:14.206
I LOVE HER, YOU FEEL ME?

31:14.206 --> 31:15.007
NO, I'M MESSING WITH

31:15.007 --> 31:15.674
A MARRIED MAN.

31:15.674 --> 31:16.408

31:16.408 --> 31:17.376
SEE, THAT'S REAL, THOUGH.

31:17.376 --> 31:18.244

31:18.244 --> 31:19.245
THAT'S REAL.

31:19.245 --> 31:20.812
I'M GONNA BE REAL.

31:20.812 --> 31:21.747
I MEAN, WE TEXT, BUT WE

31:21.747 --> 31:23.115
ARE FRIENDS.

31:23.115 --> 31:24.350
HE WAS JUST--HE WANTED TO KNOW,

31:24.350 --> 31:25.717
WHEN HE WAS IN REHAB, IF I WAS

31:25.717 --> 31:26.518
DEALING WITH ANYBODY.

31:26.518 --> 31:27.819
HE TELLS ME HE MISS ME, LET ME--

31:27.819 --> 31:28.955
HE--HE--WHILE HE WAS

31:28.955 --> 31:29.655

31:29.655 --> 31:30.589
AND THAT'S A LIE.

31:30.589 --> 31:31.390
YOU FEEL ME?

31:31.390 --> 31:32.124
THAT'S A LIE.

31:32.124 --> 31:35.127
[all talking at once]

31:36.495 --> 31:37.163
I DO THAT.

31:37.163 --> 31:38.497
AND THAT'S REAL.

31:38.497 --> 31:39.298
AND THEN YOU TEXTING HER?

31:39.298 --> 31:40.332

AND THAT'S REAL.

31:41.133 --> 31:42.268
LET'S HEAR THE FACTS HERE

31:42.268 --> 31:43.069
OF THE SITUATION.

31:43.069 --> 31:44.170

31:44.170 --> 31:45.204
ALL THIS SEASON WHILE THESE TWO

31:45.204 --> 31:46.538

31:46.538 --> 31:47.706
WELL, HE WAS TELLING ME THEY

31:47.706 --> 31:48.975
WEREN'T ENGAGED ANYMORE, SO

31:48.975 --> 31:50.509
SCRAPPY AND I DID DO A COUPLE

31:50.509 --> 31:51.843
THINGS, YES, BUT THEY WEREN'T

31:51.843 --> 31:52.611

31:52.611 --> 31:53.445
IS THAT THE NEW WAY OF SAYING

31:53.445 --> 31:54.313
YOU SLEPT TOGETHER, "YOU DID

31:54.313 --> 31:55.314
A COUPLE THINGS"?

31:55.314 --> 31:56.048
I MEAN, BECAUSE IT'S

31:56.048 --> 31:56.782
NOTHING NOW.

31:56.782 --> 31:57.616
IT'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NOW.

31:57.616 --> 31:59.818
LIKE, AT THE END OF THE DAY,

31:59.818 --> 32:00.752
I MESS WITH PEOPLE THAT MESS

32:00.752 --> 32:01.487

32:01.487 --> 32:03.322
I DONE BEEN THERE WITH ERICA,

32:03.322 --> 32:04.223
AND, YEAH, I DONE DID A LOT OF

39:22.561 --> 39:24.430
UNCENSORED, BUT ALL THE TIME,

39:24.430 --> 39:25.997
