<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:39.873 --> 00:41.090
I hate this day.

00:41.083 --> 00:44.303
The anniversary of the worst
day of our lives.

00:44.294 --> 00:47.798
The day we lost
our state championship game.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.302
Arlen High sucks!

00:51.301 --> 00:53.224
Mustangs! Mustangs!

00:53.220 --> 00:54.847
What's up, losers?

00:54.846 --> 00:56.519
Oh, man, here we go, man.

00:56.515 --> 00:59.018
Talkin' 'bout every got-dang
ol' year, man, come by.

00:59.017 --> 01:01.065
Taunt walk, suckas.

01:08.110 --> 01:11.580
Everyone bow down
before the state champions.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.370
Don't do it, Bill.

01:13.365 --> 01:14.537
Come on, guys.

01:14.533 --> 01:16.581
This isn't sportsmanlike
behavior.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.375
Are you a big loser?

01:18.370 --> 01:19.587
Yes, you are.

01:19.580 --> 01:20.797
You are a loser!

01:20.789 --> 01:22.883
I don't know
how you can gloat so much.

01:22.874 --> 01:24.876
You won with four field goals.

01:24.876 --> 01:28.301
Your kicker, Sergio, was the
only good player on your team.

01:28.297 --> 01:31.392
This is the leg
that did it to you.

01:31.383 --> 01:33.602
The leg that won us state!

01:33.594 --> 01:34.846
Smell de feet.

01:34.845 --> 01:35.812
I think it's pathetic

01:35.971 --> 01:37.848
you guys still care
about that game.

01:37.848 --> 01:39.395
I barely even think about it

01:39.391 --> 01:42.736
because I have so much positive
stuff going on in my life now.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.323
<i>Mail's here.</i>

01:50.319 --> 01:52.321
There's something for you, Dad.

01:52.321 --> 01:54.323
Such a fancy envelope.

01:54.323 --> 01:55.540
Huh.

01:55.532 --> 01:56.875
Could be from a customer.

01:56.867 --> 02:00.747
"Dear Hank, thank you
for snapping your ankle

02:00.746 --> 02:02.043
"and losing the game.

02:02.039 --> 02:03.507
Best, The Mustangs."

02:03.498 --> 02:05.171
Ugh, damn this day!

02:05.167 --> 02:06.589
How dare they?

02:06.585 --> 02:08.586
You have nothing
to be ashamed of, Hank.

02:08.586 --> 02:09.883
You broke your ankle.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.178
No one faults you
for getting hurt.

02:12.174 --> 02:14.176
How can you possibly
blame yourself

02:14.176 --> 02:15.678
for an injury like that?

02:20.349 --> 02:21.817
This is your fault!

02:21.975 --> 02:24.603
And you got them weak ankles
from your mommy,

02:24.603 --> 02:28.153
'cause I didn't have no ankles
when I did it to her!

02:28.148 --> 02:31.243
It has been 23 years, Hank.

02:31.234 --> 02:33.612
And I, for one, am sick of it.

02:33.612 --> 02:35.831
Showing up at my
grandmother's funeral

02:35.822 --> 02:37.199
was just bad taste.

02:37.199 --> 02:38.872
This has to end.

02:38.867 --> 02:42.371
Peggy, Coach told us the state
championship is for life.

02:42.371 --> 02:46.467
A moment that singularly defines
a man in victory or defeat.

02:46.458 --> 02:49.507
It's where spirit and
determination are put on trial,

02:49.503 --> 02:51.847
and the final verdict stands.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.385
This won't be over until

02:53.382 --> 02:56.727
everyone who was at that game
is dead.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.725
Dang it!

03:03.725 --> 03:05.523
Yeah, sucka!

03:05.519 --> 03:06.645
Lock the doors!

03:07.604 --> 03:10.483
We're sitting down to dinner,
for God's sake.

03:10.482 --> 03:11.608
Careful eating, Hank.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.360
You might choke!

03:13.360 --> 03:16.614
This is the sound of
your ankle snapping.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.581
All right, that tears it!

03:18.573 --> 03:20.291
That's right.
We have had enough.

03:20.283 --> 03:23.253
You poked the bear
one too many times.

03:23.245 --> 03:24.747
Let's dance!

03:24.746 --> 03:25.872
Get 'em, Mom!

03:25.872 --> 03:28.091
All right, now just
calm down, everybody.

03:28.083 --> 03:30.586
Guys, I have taken
your crap long enough.

03:30.585 --> 03:32.087
I want a rematch.

03:32.087 --> 03:33.179
Hells, yes.

03:33.171 --> 03:34.673
I would love reliving

03:34.673 --> 03:36.220
the greatest night
of my life, Hank Hill.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.809
This rematch is on.

03:37.968 --> 03:41.472
You just stepped into
the ring of fire, man.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.473
I cannot wait for this,
except this time,

03:43.473 --> 03:45.851
I think we should play
flag because we are old.

03:45.851 --> 03:48.855
You... want... to
start... the ruckus.

03:48.854 --> 03:51.448
You... want...
to start... the ruckus.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.364
You... want...
to start... the ruckus.

03:54.359 --> 03:57.784
Oh, Hank, what have you done?

03:57.779 --> 03:58.826
A rematch?

03:58.989 --> 04:00.866
But what if we don't win?

04:00.866 --> 04:03.085
My life went downhill
after that game.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.704
If we lose again,
I... I might not make it.

04:05.704 --> 04:07.172
Come on, Bill.

04:07.164 --> 04:11.135
For 23 years, the Mustangs have
tainted the title of champion.

04:11.126 --> 04:13.879
Now we have the opportunity
to change history.

04:13.879 --> 04:16.928
To show them
how real champions behave.

04:18.632 --> 04:20.805
To stop the taunting.

04:23.805 --> 04:27.605
Man, my-my dang ol' arm
is still... good, man.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.820
I am bigger
than I was back then.

04:29.978 --> 04:33.448
It will be an honor
to towel you guys again.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.783
Well, all right, then.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.119
It's time to get the team
back together.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.863
Who knows where all
the Longhorns ended up.

04:39.863 --> 04:41.740
They could be anywhere.

04:53.668 --> 04:56.137
Fred!

05:04.471 --> 05:07.520
Hello, sir, we're looking
for your son, Kevin.

05:07.516 --> 05:09.109
Hank. It's me.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.852
I'm Kevin.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.354
It's been, uh...

05:12.354 --> 05:13.822
hard couple of years.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.465
Hank, I live in Phoenix now.

05:31.456 --> 05:34.426
You want me to drop
everything, fly back to Arlen

05:34.417 --> 05:38.593
to play a flag football game
against our high school rivals?

05:38.588 --> 05:40.511
Of course I will.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.565
Toasty towels if you need 'em!

05:48.557 --> 05:49.774
Woo-hoo!

05:49.933 --> 05:52.686
This is my field!
My turf!

05:52.686 --> 05:54.859
Stay out of the
Bill-dozer's way!

05:55.939 --> 05:57.782
This is so exciting.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.367
Oh, you're lucky.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.453
Your dad can actually
do something.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.242
My dad is just a towel boy.

06:03.238 --> 06:04.865
Lookin' good, Dad!

06:04.865 --> 06:07.243
You should wear
flags more often!

06:07.242 --> 06:08.869
Awesome folding, Dad!

06:08.869 --> 06:11.873
Really... square!

06:11.872 --> 06:13.419
Dude, I can't do it.

06:13.415 --> 06:15.008
All right, guys, take a knee.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.128
Now, I know it's been
a difficult

06:17.127 --> 06:20.347
23 years... especially for me.

06:20.338 --> 06:23.592
I'm sorry my ankle and I
let you guys down.

06:23.592 --> 06:26.391
But today we start
a new journey...

06:26.386 --> 06:28.855
One that will end
with our dignity.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.770
It's time we blow away
the dark clouds

06:30.932 --> 06:34.812
and let the sun finally
shine down on us in victory.

06:36.605 --> 06:37.652
You said it, Hill.

06:37.647 --> 06:39.649
If I could still feel anything,

06:39.649 --> 06:40.821
I'd be inspired.

06:40.984 --> 06:43.863
Now come on,
let's go kick some Mustang ass.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.284
Go, Longhorns!

06:48.867 --> 06:50.835
Dang ol' 21... holly...

06:50.827 --> 06:53.580
30 eagle red red blue hike!

06:53.580 --> 06:55.582
Protect the quarterback!

07:14.267 --> 07:16.690
Ow. Aw, what happened?

07:17.979 --> 07:19.822
Why are you looking at me
like that?

07:19.981 --> 07:21.858
Oh, my God, I hurt Hank.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.360
I broke his nose!

07:23.360 --> 07:27.615
Hank, can you smell how many
fingers I'm holding up?

07:27.614 --> 07:28.706
Is that brain?

07:28.698 --> 07:30.700
Dear God, I think I see brain.

07:30.700 --> 07:33.670
We gotta reset his nose
before the cartilage sticks.

07:33.662 --> 07:35.289
Do what you need to do,
Kleehammer.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.882
Just fix it so we can
get back to practice.

07:37.874 --> 07:40.923
Someone get me two pencils
and a rock. Now!

07:40.919 --> 07:41.886
Uh, wait, w...

07:41.878 --> 07:43.300
I got a pencil and a stick.

07:43.296 --> 07:46.596
Uh, are you sure that's
the best... procedure?

07:46.591 --> 07:47.843
Don't worry, Hill,

07:47.842 --> 07:50.186
I've reset a thousand noses
on the field.

07:51.763 --> 07:53.106
Hold him still.

07:53.098 --> 07:55.396
Here, you can bite
on this towel.

07:55.392 --> 07:57.486
On the count of three.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.854
One...

07:58.853 --> 08:00.400
Ooh...

08:02.148 --> 08:05.027
It's an art,
not a science, people.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.205
Hey, stud.

08:09.197 --> 08:10.449
How was practice?

08:14.119 --> 08:17.043
I don't have to beat up
someone's son, do I?

08:17.038 --> 08:18.665
It's not that bad.

08:18.665 --> 08:19.882
I can barely feel it.

08:19.874 --> 08:21.717
Probably because
you're in shock.

08:21.710 --> 08:23.337
You have to go to the hospital.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.054
No, no, they'll just tell me

08:25.046 --> 08:26.923
I can't practice until it heals.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.641
I have to get in shape.

08:28.633 --> 08:32.433
A game like this usually only
comes along once in a lifetime.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.773
What is that, that whistling?

08:35.932 --> 08:37.730
Is that coming from your face?

08:45.483 --> 08:48.578
Waiting rooms
are always so quiet.

08:48.570 --> 08:52.040
It makes you want to scream,
but you know you shouldn't.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.875
But you want to.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.629
Peggy? Where am I?

08:57.620 --> 08:59.338
I took you to the ER, Hank,

08:59.330 --> 09:01.458
and they referred us
to this specialist.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.051
How did you get me around?

09:03.043 --> 09:04.590
It was surprisingly easy.

09:04.586 --> 09:05.883
Your body was limp.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.428
And a weird guy we met
in the parking lot helped.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.855
A plastic surgeon?!

09:15.847 --> 09:17.224
I can't be here.

09:17.223 --> 09:19.271
I'm leaving.
Hank, you're in pain.

09:19.267 --> 09:20.860
If you want to play football,

09:20.852 --> 09:23.822
you need to get your nose
fixed first.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.864
Oh... I don't know.

09:27.859 --> 09:30.829
I guess if it'll get
me back on the field,

09:30.987 --> 09:33.081
I'll stay to discuss my

09:33.073 --> 09:35.576
necessary surgery.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.876
I've made a nose out
of worse than this.

09:39.871 --> 09:41.669
Have a look through
our nose book

09:41.664 --> 09:43.291
and pick out one that you like.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.885
I just want my nose back
like it was.

09:45.877 --> 09:47.675
Oh, that old thing?

09:47.670 --> 09:50.640
Hank, this is your chance
to do something different.

09:50.632 --> 09:52.100
Something fun.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.765
Oh, how about the Travolta?

09:53.927 --> 09:56.601
I even think he could
pull off a Roger Staubach.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.018
Staubach?

09:58.014 --> 10:00.858
Uh, no, I just want my old nose.

10:00.850 --> 10:01.817
Your call.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.819
But, uh, after I straighten
out your nose,

10:03.978 --> 10:05.855
is there anything else
you want me to change

10:05.855 --> 10:07.072
while I'm in there?

10:07.065 --> 10:08.066
Nope.

10:08.066 --> 10:09.443
What I had was fine.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.570
Really? Nothing at all?

10:13.822 --> 10:15.449
My left nostril.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.870
Oh, dear.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.584
We've never talked
about it before.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.123
It is bigger than the other.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.372
It's easy to fix.

10:21.371 --> 10:24.500
Then quit yammering
about it and do it.

10:27.669 --> 10:28.886
Don't worry, guys.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.425
The doctor will fix me right up,

10:30.421 --> 10:32.799
and I'll be back on that field
in no time.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.472
You better be, Hank.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.687
Without you, we're gonna have to
build an offense around Kevin.

10:37.679 --> 10:38.851
Kevin!

10:38.847 --> 10:41.851
Well, it's time.

10:43.601 --> 10:45.319
You were protecting
the quarterback.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.483
Just doing your job.

10:48.231 --> 10:49.027
Bill.

11:02.704 --> 11:05.833
the moment
we've all been waiting for.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.422
Hank, careful what you wish for,

11:08.418 --> 11:10.887
because it just might come...

11:10.879 --> 11:12.597
true!

11:12.589 --> 11:14.091
Look at my trophy husband!

11:14.090 --> 11:16.843
I don't care if they had
to use part of your butt.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.720
That looks great!

11:18.720 --> 11:21.394
My nostril.

11:21.389 --> 11:22.857
You fixed it.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.613
It's perfect.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.870
Hey, it's Hank!

11:43.870 --> 11:46.339
You fixed your nostril.

11:46.331 --> 11:47.548
Your only imperfection.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.463
It's so nice.
Can I rub it?

11:49.459 --> 11:51.461
As long as it lets
the air in and out,

11:51.461 --> 11:52.883
it doesn't matter.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.802
The important thing is,
I'm ready for action.

11:54.964 --> 11:58.719
All right, ladies,
let's play some football!

12:01.471 --> 12:03.098
Good to have you back, Hank.

12:03.097 --> 12:04.815
We're counting on you.

12:06.851 --> 12:09.195
Hey, Hill,

12:09.187 --> 12:10.860
now that your nose is fixed,

12:10.855 --> 12:12.857
can you tell how bad you stink?

12:14.859 --> 12:17.362
Hey, forget about those ladies.

12:17.362 --> 12:19.865
Let them go shave their
legs, and braid their...

12:19.864 --> 12:22.037
I don't know what ladies do.

12:22.033 --> 12:24.035
Let's just play some football.

12:25.161 --> 12:27.835
I got it! I got it!

12:30.416 --> 12:32.418
My nose!

12:33.503 --> 12:35.050
How did he miss that?

12:36.464 --> 12:37.841
S-Sun was in my eyes.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.763
Yeah.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.261
Let's run it again, guys.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.808
Move it! Move it!

12:51.854 --> 12:53.777
No, don't hit it!

12:53.773 --> 12:54.774
It's his nose.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.318
It must still be hurt.

12:56.317 --> 12:57.569
Hank's hurt!

12:59.445 --> 13:01.493
Yes. Yes,
you're right, I'm hurt.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.537
I-I have to go now.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.877
I'm telling you, guys.
It's his nose.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.879
It's still hurting
from the surgery.

13:16.879 --> 13:19.223
But there's only three days left
till the game.

13:19.215 --> 13:21.809
If Hank doesn't play,
I'm gonna need a lot of liquor

13:21.968 --> 13:23.390
and a handful of anything.

13:23.386 --> 13:24.763
Grab a flag, Towelie.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.306
You're in the game!

13:26.306 --> 13:28.434
What? I can't do anything.

13:28.433 --> 13:31.277
I can't catch, I can't throw,
I can't even run.

13:31.269 --> 13:33.567
Come on, Dad.
You can do it!

13:33.563 --> 13:36.817
You may not be able to
run, but you can flee.

13:38.693 --> 13:40.320
All right, you know,
I've had enough.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.617
You play through the pain.

13:41.612 --> 13:43.239
That's basic stuff.

13:43.239 --> 13:46.539
It's time for me to send Hank
on a little trip called guilt.

13:50.288 --> 13:51.585
Hey, buddy.

13:51.581 --> 13:52.878
How's the nose feeling?

13:52.874 --> 13:54.421
Uh, not so good.

13:54.417 --> 13:55.714
P-Pretty bad.

13:55.710 --> 13:56.882
Ow.

13:56.878 --> 14:00.098
Yeah. I felt so bad once
that I moved to Phoenix.

14:00.089 --> 14:02.137
After the state championship,
actually.

14:02.133 --> 14:03.601
That you lost.

14:03.593 --> 14:05.766
Phoenix is hotter than Texas,
if you can believe that.

14:05.928 --> 14:07.271
Sucks.

14:07.263 --> 14:09.857
I really wish I could
play, but the, uh...

14:09.849 --> 14:12.352
the pain is just excruciating.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.980
I better go ice my nose.

14:55.853 --> 14:57.696
Well, there you are, sleepyhead!

14:57.688 --> 14:59.565
You never sleep later than me.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.112
I thought you were dead.

15:01.109 --> 15:03.453
And it made me realize
how much I love you.

15:03.444 --> 15:05.196
Where are you going?

15:05.196 --> 15:06.823
We're gonna run some errands
before the game.

15:06.989 --> 15:09.242
I'm gonna get a new duvet cover
for our bed.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.540
Well, wait just a minute.
I'm coming, too.

15:11.536 --> 15:14.631
You want to help us
pick out a duvet?

15:14.622 --> 15:16.215
The big game is today.

15:16.207 --> 15:18.881
Shouldn't you be painting
your chest and face?

15:18.876 --> 15:20.253
I-I can't paint my face.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.005
I'm in too much pain.

15:22.004 --> 15:23.381
Uh-huh.

15:23.381 --> 15:25.850
You do realize
I'm going to Frilly Lilly's?

15:25.842 --> 15:28.436
Well, of course
you're going to Frilly Lilly's.

15:28.428 --> 15:31.557
They have the best, um...
selection?

15:31.556 --> 15:33.433
Okay.

15:33.433 --> 15:34.559
Let me just grab

15:34.559 --> 15:35.856
my jacket.

15:35.852 --> 15:36.774
Didn't that hurt?

15:36.936 --> 15:38.188
Oh. Oh, yes.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.860
The, uh...
The pain is throbbing.

15:39.856 --> 15:42.530
It's like a heartbeat
in my face.

15:42.525 --> 15:45.074
You're gonna go see Dr. Cook.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.639
So, Hank,

16:05.631 --> 16:07.759
I gather you're experiencing
some discomfort.

16:07.925 --> 16:09.177
He's faking.

16:09.177 --> 16:10.804
Peggy? W-Why would
You say that?

16:10.970 --> 16:12.847
You've seen the pain I'm in.

16:12.847 --> 16:13.814
It's not your nose.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.852
I touch it when you sleep.

16:16.851 --> 16:19.479
He's been acting strange
ever since the surgery.

16:19.479 --> 16:20.856
I can't figure out why.

16:20.855 --> 16:22.448
Oh, I see this all the time.

16:22.440 --> 16:25.068
People love my work so much
that they get a little vain.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.364
Vanity?

16:26.360 --> 16:28.033
That doesn't sound like Hank.

16:28.029 --> 16:29.326
I just don't understand.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.791
He wanted to play
in that game so much...

16:31.782 --> 16:33.159
Wait.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.878
You're too scared to play
in that game, aren't you?

16:35.870 --> 16:37.747
What? I am not.

16:37.747 --> 16:38.794
You're talking crazy.

16:38.956 --> 16:40.253
Please.

16:40.249 --> 16:42.502
As a kid who uses the cramps

16:42.502 --> 16:46.552
as an excuse to get out of gym,
I know a faker when I hear one.

16:46.547 --> 16:47.764
You've been waiting
your whole life

16:47.924 --> 16:49.426
to redeem yourself,

16:49.425 --> 16:52.269
and you're afraid if you play
in the game, you'll fail.

16:52.261 --> 16:54.855
Oh, it's okay to admit
you're scared, Hank.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.190
Scared?

16:56.182 --> 16:57.855
Now, how can you say that?

16:57.850 --> 16:58.851
That's ridiculous.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.103
It's what he said.

17:00.102 --> 17:02.776
I love my perfect, perfect nose.

17:02.939 --> 17:05.782
Is it so wrong to be beautiful?

17:05.775 --> 17:07.823
Your wife is right, you know.

17:07.984 --> 17:09.202
Excuse me?

17:09.194 --> 17:11.414
The walls are paper-thin.

17:11.405 --> 17:13.874
Listen, we're all here because
there's something about us

17:13.866 --> 17:15.834
we didn't like and
wanted to change.

17:15.992 --> 17:18.837
For me, it was my ears,
nose and lips.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.376
And a weak chin.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.875
And it sounds like for you,

17:21.874 --> 17:24.127
it's the fact
that you lost that game.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.627
Listen to her, Hank.

17:25.627 --> 17:27.925
She's much older
and wiser than she looks.

17:27.922 --> 17:29.299
Thank you, dear.

17:29.298 --> 17:31.801
You need to deal with your past.

17:31.801 --> 17:33.144
Just like I dealt
with my thin lips.

17:33.135 --> 17:34.352
Oh, yeah.

17:34.345 --> 17:35.847
Mm-hmm.

17:35.846 --> 17:37.348
No, no, it's not the same.

17:37.348 --> 17:38.565
I just...

17:40.017 --> 17:42.315
It was so horrible.

17:42.311 --> 17:44.860
Everyone was counting on me,
and I blew it.

17:44.855 --> 17:47.699
If I lose this game again,
it's forever.

17:47.692 --> 17:49.035
Nothing is forever.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.573
I used to have a penis.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.870
I'm gonna remember something
from today.

17:53.864 --> 17:57.118
And it can either be
what sh... him just said,

17:57.118 --> 17:58.870
or you playing football.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.121
Come on, Dad!

18:00.121 --> 18:01.498
There's still time!

18:02.456 --> 18:04.629
Go play some football, honey.

18:07.712 --> 18:09.009
Just curious.

18:09.005 --> 18:10.723
Over or under 60?

18:10.715 --> 18:12.433
Way over.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.233
Hey, man, talkin' 'bout time...
time out!

18:24.228 --> 18:25.480
He's here to save us.

18:25.479 --> 18:26.856
- Thank God.
- Oh, well done.

18:26.856 --> 18:29.029
And in the fourth
quarter, pretty dramatic.

18:29.025 --> 18:30.868
It's great to see you, Hank.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.362
Even though
this is flag football,

18:32.361 --> 18:33.863
it feels like
we're getting pummeled.

18:33.863 --> 18:37.288
Gribble's got heart,
but he's no replacement for you.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.877
Every coach dreams
of finding that spaz kid

18:39.869 --> 18:42.418
who can play like Rudy or Radio.

18:42.413 --> 18:45.212
But nobody's gonna make
a movie about Gribble.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.879
There's mud in my lungs.

18:49.879 --> 18:51.847
Don't worry, fellas.
We got this.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.386
And when we win,

18:53.382 --> 18:56.761
we'll give them a lesson
in how real champions behave.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.838
Ho-yeah! Get that flag!

19:26.082 --> 19:29.427
Careful with that fancy
face, Bruce Jenner.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.648
He still has the flags.

19:46.644 --> 19:47.645
Go, Hank!

19:54.985 --> 19:56.828
All right, Dad!

19:58.280 --> 20:01.204
Run...! Dad...!

20:16.757 --> 20:17.679
All right!

20:17.675 --> 20:19.598
Why did we agree to do this?

20:19.593 --> 20:21.186
We had nothing to gain.

20:22.263 --> 20:24.265
Thank you.

20:25.850 --> 20:28.399
I can finally move back home and
get the hell out of Phoenix!

20:38.863 --> 20:41.662
So, you see, your portfolio
is outperforming the market.

20:41.657 --> 20:44.331
Mr. Portnoy, there's some people
here to see you.

20:44.326 --> 20:45.669
Yvonne, I'm in a meeting.

20:45.661 --> 20:48.505
Happy loserversary!

20:49.790 --> 20:51.884
Not such a big shot
anymore, huh?

20:51.876 --> 20:56.052
Just a lowly successful
financial professional!

20:56.046 --> 20:58.720
I wouldn't trust this guy
with your money.

20:58.716 --> 21:01.014
He'll just lose it,
'cause he's a loser!

21:01.010 --> 21:04.014
He's a big baby loser!

21:04.013 --> 21:06.357
Hey, this is fun.

21:07.558 --> 21:08.855
Loser!

21:08.851 --> 21:10.603
Yeah, man, happy dang
ol' loserversary, man...

21:10.603 --> 21:13.026
I'm not a loser.
You are a loser.

21:13.022 --> 21:15.241
Dang ol' loser, man.

21:53.479 --> 21:56.153
