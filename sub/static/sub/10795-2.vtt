00:01.680 --> 00:03.876
<i>I've been brought in from the Metropolitan Police</i>

00:04.040 --> 00:07.670
<i>to lead a review into the investigation of the murder of Alice Monroe.</i>

00:07.840 --> 00:11.311
There's been a shooting in a house a mile away. A car was stopped just along there.

00:11.480 --> 00:14.200
<i>He had things entirely under his control,</i>

00:14.360 --> 00:17.239
<i>which leads me to think that this was not his first murder.</i>

00:17.400 --> 00:19.835
I'm staying at the Hilton, room 203.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.038
Go back to your reviews, Stella. I don't want the two murders linked.

00:23.200 --> 00:25.431
Ned Callan, Belfast Chronicle. Can I have a word?

00:25.600 --> 00:27.956
- Not at the moment, no.
- Not even off the record?

00:28.120 --> 00:29.839
There's no such thing, as you well know.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.711
Failure to see the crimes are linked. That's the thing that will allow the killer to strike again.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.276
Perhaps she did go stay with her sister.

DS James Olson. Just after 2150 hours a car was stopped in the vicinity of the Falls Road

01:13.640 --> 01:15.393
because it was being driven erratically.

01:15.560 --> 01:18.553
A search revealed two concealed firearms and a quantity of ammunition.

01:18.720 --> 01:20.757
I've reason to believe this man Terry Mclnturff

01:20.920 --> 01:22.957
was involved in the murder of Michael Lockwood

01:23.120 --> 01:25.112
in the Shankhill area earlier this evening.

01:25.280 --> 01:27.272
- Empty your mouth.
- Screw you.

01:28.560 --> 01:29.994
Empty your mouth.

01:31.400 --> 01:33.551
Screw you.

01:33.720 --> 01:36.189
- Spit it out!

01:36.880 --> 01:38.872
Spit it out!

01:39.520 --> 01:43.355
- Get him back in the cell.
- Oi, you, come on! Come on!

01:43.880 --> 01:45.599
Come on!

01:45.760 --> 01:47.831
- We need some assistance here.

01:50.440 --> 01:53.911
- We need to obtain all clothes and footwear.

01:55.960 --> 01:58.156
- Right.
- Come on!

03:16.360 --> 03:18.397
I wasn't sure this is what you meant.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.832
It's what I meant.

04:16.399 --> 04:18.312
I should take a shower.

04:18.480 --> 04:20.437
No need.

04:21.560 --> 04:23.552
I like it.

08:38.200 --> 08:39.759
Should I take your number?

09:51.800 --> 09:55.510
..<i>two guns seized following last night's murder in West Belfast.</i>

09:55.680 --> 09:59.833
<i>Today, the chairman of the Independent Policing Executive Morgan Monroe</i>

10:00.000 --> 10:01.400
<i>issued this statement:</i>

10:01.560 --> 10:05.156
<i>The people of Belfast would be horrified by last night's shooting.</i>

10:05.320 --> 10:09.872
<i>These attacks leave behind a trail of suffering, misery, and hurt in their wake.</i>

10:10.040 --> 10:13.920
<i>Meanwhile, the hunt for the killer of Alice Monroe continues.</i>

10:14.080 --> 10:18.233
<i>Aaron Monroe, who has been helping the police with their inquiries, spoke to our reporter.</i>

10:18.400 --> 10:23.520
<i>We're very grateful that the police have finally released Alice's body to her family.</i>

10:24.600 --> 10:30.517
<i>And although we were separated at the time of her death we both remained very close friends.</i>

10:44.320 --> 10:45.993
- Hey!
- Hey.

10:46.160 --> 10:48.152
There's fresh coffee there.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.832
Sorry, we have to go.

10:51.520 --> 10:54.592
You look tired. Did you have a busy night?

10:55.280 --> 10:56.953
Quite busy yeah ,.

10:57.120 --> 11:00.670
- Let me take this for you.
- Don't worry, I'm fine. Don't fuss.

11:02.160 --> 11:04.720
Right, grab your things, you two. Come on, let's go.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.392
Come on.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.592
Thought this might interest you.

11:58.640 --> 12:00.632
This was last night?

12:04.480 --> 12:06.915
I was at the hotel dining room, about to eat.

12:07.080 --> 12:10.198
Callan came in and sat down, uninvited, at my table.

12:10.360 --> 12:12.511
I didn't see a photographer.

12:12.680 --> 12:15.149
- How did he know you were staying there?
- I don't know.

12:15.320 --> 12:16.834
What did you say to him?

12:17.000 --> 12:19.196
- I asked him to leave.
- You should have told me.

12:19.360 --> 12:20.430
Told you what?

12:20.600 --> 12:22.796
All meetings with journalists have to be on the record.

12:22.960 --> 12:26.749
It wasn't a meeting. He doorstepped me. I said, "Go away." There's nothing there.

12:27.800 --> 12:30.793
- What did he want with you?
- He wanted to hear about the review.

12:30.960 --> 12:34.749
He wanted to talk about the murder. I refused to discuss either.

12:36.320 --> 12:40.394
I've a meeting with the Independent Policing Executive this morning.

12:40.880 --> 12:44.999
This...has done nothing to make my job easier.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.754
Keep that. One for the archives.

13:24.960 --> 13:29.352
<i>Where she went, who she saw, what she did, were no longer any of my business.</i>

13:30.080 --> 13:32.390
<i>I can't help you with any of that.</i>

13:35.240 --> 13:40.031
<i>You know, she seemed to call you often enough. Twice on the day she died.</i>

13:40.200 --> 13:42.999
<i>- Probably to bitch and moan.
- Bitch and moan?</i>

13:43.160 --> 13:45.914
<i>Definitely not to share any details of her new life.</i>

13:46.080 --> 13:47.673
<i>She moved on?</i>

13:47.840 --> 13:51.834
<i>Well, if you think getting a tattoo and dressing like a slut is moving on, then, yeah.</i>

13:52.000 --> 13:53.798
<i>You disapproved?</i>

13:53.960 --> 13:56.270
<i>It wasn't something I'd let her do when we were together.</i>

13:56.440 --> 13:59.433
<i>She'd need your permission to do something like that,</i>

13:59.600 --> 14:01.592
<i>when you were married?</i>

14:02.360 --> 14:04.352
<i>I think I'd like to leave now.</i>

14:12.120 --> 14:15.318
These are all the prescription drugs gathered at the crime scene?

14:15.480 --> 14:17.472
Yes, ma'am.

14:21.440 --> 14:24.751
No sign of any illegal drug use with regard to Alice Monroe?

14:25.080 --> 14:27.072
No, ma'am. None.

14:32.040 --> 14:36.159
Did it occur to you that Aaron Monroe was clucking during his interviews?

14:36.600 --> 14:38.592
At the time, no.

14:40.720 --> 14:44.191
- He was very on edge.
- Looks like a coke head to me.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.915
Worth following up with the action manager, I think.

14:50.120 --> 14:52.032
- Thanks, Mary.

15:07.600 --> 15:11.514
Fewer people have been killed or seriously injured on our roads.

15:11.680 --> 15:15.071
The levels of sectarian crime have reduced over the last year.

15:15.240 --> 15:19.632
We have seized more illegal drugs, arrested more drug offenders -

15:19.800 --> 15:23.555
and this has been delivered despite increasing economic cutbacks,

15:23.720 --> 15:26.315
and increasing threats against our officers.

15:28.160 --> 15:31.312
<i>- Bacon and Day Solicitors.</i>
- Hi, is Sarah Kay there?

15:31.480 --> 15:33.472
<i>She's not in the office today.</i>

15:34.960 --> 15:37.839
- Do you know why? <i>- Who is this, please?</i>

15:38.000 --> 15:41.914
- I just need to speak to her. <i>- Shall I put you through to her voicemail?</i>

15:42.680 --> 15:44.751
No. Thanks for your help.

15:51.160 --> 15:55.359
Kevin McSwain. The solicitor representing Terry Mclnturff and Jonas Dylan.

16:04.560 --> 16:06.153
Why was their car stopped?

16:06.320 --> 16:09.199
It was being driven erratically close to the scene of a crime.

16:09.360 --> 16:12.353
- You have witness statements to that effect?
- We do.

16:12.520 --> 16:14.751
I should like copies of those witness statements.

16:14.920 --> 16:15.751
OK.

16:15.920 --> 16:19.277
I also want a written list of every question that you intend to ask.

16:19.440 --> 16:22.638
What? So you and your clients can cook up some crazy cover story?

16:23.480 --> 16:25.358
Get real.

16:25.520 --> 16:30.276
I understand that you forcibly removed chewing gum from my client Terry Mclnturff.

16:30.440 --> 16:32.875
For his own safety. Was worried he might choke.

16:33.560 --> 16:36.792
Well, it was, in fact, nicotine gum, as prescribed by his GP.

16:36.960 --> 16:39.316
So he's entitled to a supply while he's in custody,

16:39.480 --> 16:41.517
just as he would be any other prescription drug.

16:41.680 --> 16:44.514
And you're in breach of custody regulations by withholding it.

16:45.440 --> 16:47.716
- So make a complaint.
- I intend to.

16:49.400 --> 16:51.676
The Lockwood house was heavily fortified.

16:51.840 --> 16:54.435
Two of the three men arrested were known to the police.

16:54.640 --> 16:59.954
So erm...there's no indication that distant Republicans were involved in the murder.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.520
None whatsoever.

17:01.680 --> 17:06.596
This was a cold-blooded killing, which we are, at present, treating as drugs-related.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.391
This is the location of the shooting.

17:10.560 --> 17:13.280
It's where the car you were travelling in was stopped.

17:13.440 --> 17:16.035
Explain to me where'd you been, tell me where you were going.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.760
After advice, my client will not be answering any questions.

17:18.920 --> 17:20.559
- Let him answer that.
- I've told you.

17:20.720 --> 17:23.791
- After advice, my...
- Then let him answer that for himself!

17:27.760 --> 17:29.956
Do you know this man? Michael Lockwood.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.995
My client will not be answering any questions.

17:34.480 --> 17:36.790
- Look at the photographs, please.
- As you well know,

17:36.960 --> 17:40.476
showing gruesome photographs to suspects is a violation of their human rights.

17:40.640 --> 17:43.678
Four shots in the back in front of his wife, his son.

17:45.280 --> 17:47.954
It was very brave, very bold.

17:51.080 --> 17:54.596
You had two handguns with you. Why?

17:56.400 --> 17:59.199
Cos you had a pre-meditated plan to kill Michael Lockwood.

17:59.360 --> 18:01.477
He could be enticed from his house by Rory McNaught.

18:01.640 --> 18:04.553
After advice, my client will not be answering any questions.

18:04.720 --> 18:06.871
Michael Lockwood was well known to us, Terry.

18:07.040 --> 18:10.351
What happened between you two? Did a drug deal go bad?

18:11.160 --> 18:12.355
Dispute over turf?

18:12.520 --> 18:15.991
After advice, my client will not be answering any questions.

18:20.880 --> 18:22.872
Don't give me that look, Terry.

18:23.920 --> 18:26.515
That bullshit only works on intelligent people.

18:26.680 --> 18:28.672
You took your phone with you, Terry.

18:30.680 --> 18:35.277
Cell tower triangulation puts you precisely here at the time of the shooting.

18:37.560 --> 18:39.870
What a dazzling display of stupidity.

18:45.160 --> 18:47.834
I know...where you live.

18:48.520 --> 18:50.239
Like I've never heard that before.

19:16.760 --> 19:21.676
I am assured by the officer in question that the journalist simply approached her

19:21.840 --> 19:24.400
in the dining room of her hotel, uninvited.

19:24.840 --> 19:27.309
She refused to discuss her presence in Belfast

19:27.480 --> 19:32.475
and refused to answer any questions about her involvement in the Alice Monroe review.

19:32.640 --> 19:34.632
He left empty-handed.

19:43.400 --> 19:48.600
You're gonna see Auntie Sarah. Yes, we are. Yes, we are.

20:12.160 --> 20:13.833
Sarah!

20:19.920 --> 20:21.718
Sarah?

20:29.920 --> 20:31.912
Sarah?

20:34.480 --> 20:36.472
Sarah?

20:37.920 --> 20:40.674
It's past two. I've been calling you.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.198
Sarah?

21:04.000 --> 21:05.992
Sarah?

21:22.240 --> 21:25.438
- What's your name, caller?

21:26.240 --> 21:28.436
<i>- I'm Marion.</i>
- I'm Samantha.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.954
- Is that your baby, Marion? <i>- Yes.</i>

21:32.120 --> 21:33.520
Is he all right?

21:33.680 --> 21:36.559
<i>It's a girl. Yes. It's not the baby. It's my sister.</i>

21:36.720 --> 21:40.396
- What about her, Marion? <i>- She won't wake up, she won't wake up.</i>

21:40.560 --> 21:43.632
- Where are you calling from? <i>- Her house.</i>

21:43.800 --> 21:47.077
And the number you called on, that's the house telephone, is it?

21:47.240 --> 21:49.118
<i>Yes.</i>

21:49.280 --> 21:51.636
Good. Help is already on its way.

21:52.600 --> 21:54.671
Are you with your sister now, Marion?

21:55.440 --> 21:58.080
<i>- I'm in the hall.</i>
- Where is your sister?

21:58.240 --> 22:00.835
<i>She's in the bedroom. Please help me.</i>

22:01.000 --> 22:04.550
Help is already on its way. It's gonna be there very soon.

22:05.960 --> 22:11.638
Any cars out near 3 Saville Road, Bravo Tango Six, Seven Echo Delta? Come in.

22:11.800 --> 22:13.120
Oh, Jesus.

22:13.280 --> 22:17.638
<i>Ambulance control? I've had a report of a body of a female at that location.</i>

22:22.000 --> 22:26.199
Uniform from Alpha Papa Two One. we are five minutes away and will respond.

22:31.520 --> 22:35.116
I can hear the siren, Marion. Can you see them?

22:37.400 --> 22:39.392
Marion, can you see them yet?

22:41.000 --> 22:41.877
<i>No.</i>

22:42.040 --> 22:44.509
They're right there, Marion. Can you see them?

22:47.360 --> 22:49.750
<i>- It's OK, madam. Come with me.
- Yes, they're here.</i>

22:49.920 --> 22:52.116
OK, Marion. They'll take care of you now.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.432
You can put the phone down.

22:56.400 --> 22:58.119
<i>Come with me, please.</i>

23:00.600 --> 23:03.672
- Hello, Police, how can I help you?

23:11.120 --> 23:13.112
That's it, madam. This way.

23:57.760 --> 23:59.956
- Uniform from Alpha Papa Nine. <i>- Go ahead.</i>

24:00.120 --> 24:03.909
I'm in the upstairs front bedroom. No sign of any intruder.

24:04.080 --> 24:06.276
<i>- Understood.</i>
- There's a dead female.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.758
It looks suspicious.

24:52.920 --> 24:54.434
Is it clear to go in?

24:54.600 --> 24:57.718
Erm...there's nothing you can do.

25:12.640 --> 25:16.077
Stone, let's get a cordon into place, OK? I need it as wide as possible.

25:16.240 --> 25:19.551
Use that wall, use that house, block off the road in both directions.

25:19.720 --> 25:22.758
You - make sure nobody gets in the house. Keep those people back, OK?

25:31.400 --> 25:33.392
You all right?

25:50.920 --> 25:53.435
- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't get you on the phone.

25:53.600 --> 25:56.035
- Called your office.

25:56.200 --> 25:58.192
Everything's laid on for tonight.

25:58.520 --> 25:59.954
I want you to cancel.

26:00.560 --> 26:02.358
What?

26:02.520 --> 26:05.274
There's too much going on. Too much attention focused on you.

26:05.440 --> 26:07.830
- I thought you were dealing with that.
- I am.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.118
But you need to play your part. Your ex-wife has been murdered.

26:11.280 --> 26:12.714
There's a funeral to get through.

26:12.880 --> 26:16.351
Here you are lounging on the car like you haven't a care in the world.

26:16.520 --> 26:18.955
People expect you to say the right things, show remorse.

26:19.120 --> 26:21.237
Dad, it's too late to cancel tonight.

26:21.400 --> 26:25.474
Our guests are expecting to be entertained. They're expecting a party.

26:26.800 --> 26:28.792
Throw that away and get in the car.

26:34.360 --> 26:38.752
I backed you in there, Jim, on the understanding you would clear my son's name.

26:39.400 --> 26:42.757
- I know, Morgan.
- Well, make that announcement...today.

26:48.360 --> 26:50.352
Burns.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.992
- What?

26:57.600 --> 27:00.798
Garrett, is your car here? There's been another murder.

27:10.680 --> 27:14.276
I think my daughter's here. I think they brought her up here.

27:15.280 --> 27:18.751
I'll be with you in a wee second. Do you want to just take a seat?

27:25.720 --> 27:28.599
Where did I go wrong?

27:29.480 --> 27:30.800
Paul.

27:30.960 --> 27:34.112
<i>- Were you sleeping?</i>
- Yes.

27:35.440 --> 27:37.432
<i>Don't forget this afternoon.</i>

27:38.560 --> 27:40.995
- What? <i>- Four o'clock.</i>

27:41.560 --> 27:43.552
Oh, yeah. OK.

27:45.040 --> 27:46.918
<i>Sorry. Just...one minute.</i>

27:47.080 --> 27:50.312
- Hello? <i>- I have to be back here at nine.</i>

27:51.480 --> 27:53.472
OK.

27:53.640 --> 27:55.472
<i>I have to go.</i>

28:01.360 --> 28:03.431
Get back. Get back, please.

28:04.480 --> 28:07.154
Go back. Down the street.

28:09.200 --> 28:11.874
- Who were the first attending officers?
- We were, ma'am.

28:12.040 --> 28:14.157
- Did you go inside?
- Ferrington did.

28:14.320 --> 28:16.312
Ferrington?

28:20.000 --> 28:22.151
- You've been in?
- Yes, ma'am.

28:22.320 --> 28:24.232
- Tell me.
- Suspected homicide.

28:24.400 --> 28:27.074
- White professional female in her 30s?
- Yes, ma'am.

28:27.240 --> 28:29.596
- Strangulation marks?
- I think so.

28:29.760 --> 28:32.878
- Where was the body located?
- In the upstairs front bedroom.

28:33.280 --> 28:35.511
- Where in the bedroom?
- On the bed.

28:36.160 --> 28:38.038
Covered or uncovered?

28:38.200 --> 28:40.192
Er...partly covered, I think.

28:40.680 --> 28:42.672
- Thank you.
- She was a solicitor.

28:43.880 --> 28:46.998
What? Was she known to you?

28:48.000 --> 28:49.992
Yes, ma'am.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.192
She's not in any pain.

28:59.600 --> 29:01.637
She's getting help breathing,

29:01.800 --> 29:06.192
and we'll do an X-ray of her chest and an echocardiogram of her heart.

29:07.760 --> 29:10.958
We'll need to do some blood tests for infection.

29:16.400 --> 29:18.392
Can I touch her?

29:49.880 --> 29:53.191
- Jim, it's Stella Gibson. <i>- I can see you.</i>

29:57.040 --> 29:59.032
Let her in.

30:09.920 --> 30:11.957
I have real worries it's the same guy.

30:12.120 --> 30:15.192
How on earth can you say that when no-one's been in yet?

30:15.920 --> 30:20.278
Two uniformed officers attended a break-in on Friday evening at the same property.

30:20.440 --> 30:24.320
Female solicitor living alone came home to find there'd been an intruder.

30:24.480 --> 30:28.235
Who'd left some items of underwear and her vibrator on her bed.

30:28.400 --> 30:29.800
What?

30:31.080 --> 30:33.072
The same officers attended today.

30:35.120 --> 30:37.112
Victim's name is Sarah Kay.

30:37.680 --> 30:40.718
Strangled, posed.

30:41.520 --> 30:44.354
- Has to be the same guy.
- No, I'm sorry, but...

30:44.520 --> 30:47.957
Was she not advised to vacate the property while the investigations were going on?

30:48.120 --> 30:53.149
There were no investigations. The victim herself decided not to pursue it.

30:55.160 --> 30:57.152
Make me SIO.

30:59.640 --> 31:03.600
I have the rank, I have the experience. I'm here.

31:03.760 --> 31:05.752
And I could be made available.

31:09.440 --> 31:11.955
This is the third murder in three months, Jim.

31:13.680 --> 31:15.797
If we don't stop him he will kill again.

31:21.360 --> 31:23.352
You OK?

31:24.120 --> 31:26.715
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to ask you a few questions.

31:26.880 --> 31:30.157
I'm Detective Superintendent Gibson, I'm acting SIO here.

31:30.320 --> 31:32.516
Sheldon Schwartz, crime scene manager.

31:32.680 --> 31:35.878
- Who's been in so far?
- The medical officer's in there now.

31:36.040 --> 31:40.034
I want it videoed, sketched and photographed before anybody else goes in.

31:40.200 --> 31:42.192
- Yes, ma'am.
- Who found her?

31:42.760 --> 31:44.752
Her sister made the initial call.

31:45.360 --> 31:48.398
- What's her name?

31:48.560 --> 31:49.676
Marion.

31:49.840 --> 31:53.834
We need to get her clothing before there's any more cross-contamination.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.117
- Handle it sensitively.
- Right.

31:56.800 --> 31:59.952
- Is a house-to-house underway?
- Yes, ma'am.

32:16.920 --> 32:22.951
The schematic stage of drawing generally occurs at this age, seven to nine.

32:23.120 --> 32:27.637
They start drawing what they are thinking rather than just what they see.

32:28.640 --> 32:30.518
When I asked Olivia what she had drawn,

32:30.680 --> 32:34.640
she told me it was a princess who had stabbed herself and died.

32:37.760 --> 32:39.638
She hasn't been sleeping very well.

32:39.800 --> 32:41.553
She looks tired.

32:41.720 --> 32:45.919
Well, Paul's work is with bereaved people, of course.

32:46.080 --> 32:48.037
And my work has its ups and downs,

32:48.200 --> 32:51.318
but we're always very careful what we say in front of the kids.

32:51.880 --> 32:53.872
Perhaps she intuited something.

32:55.120 --> 32:57.112
Perhaps.

33:03.560 --> 33:06.632
That's Professor Reed Smith. She's the pathologist.

33:08.400 --> 33:10.676
Ask her to join us at the command vehicle.

33:14.760 --> 33:16.752
Hi.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.992
How you doing?

33:19.440 --> 33:23.354
Perhaps you can do me a favour. Collect some things from my hotel room.

33:26.040 --> 33:28.032
OK, make a list.

33:31.880 --> 33:35.590
Thank you for calling us in. We really appreciate your concern for Livvy.

33:35.760 --> 33:37.956
- Daddy!
- Hey!

33:41.120 --> 33:43.191
I didn't know you were here.

33:43.360 --> 33:45.113
I'm not here.

33:45.280 --> 33:47.511
Yes, you are, Daddy. I can see you.

33:47.680 --> 33:52.232
Under floorboards, in the loft, behind bath panels, inside water cisterns.

33:52.920 --> 33:54.877
Check every rubbish and dustbin.

33:55.040 --> 33:59.512
Check for lifestyle indicators - drugs, sexual fetishes, magazines.

33:59.680 --> 34:02.434
Anything unusual or significant.

34:02.960 --> 34:08.034
Access will be tightly controlled, so everybody in oversuits, gloves, masks, overshoes.

34:08.199 --> 34:10.157
Stepping plates, where applicable.

34:10.320 --> 34:12.118
Please, everyone. Everyone, listen.

34:12.280 --> 34:15.751
No discussions relating this crime to any other recent murder.

34:16.719 --> 34:18.712
Keep your thoughts to yourselves.

34:29.159 --> 34:32.197
From the body temperature and the degree of rigor mortis,

34:32.360 --> 34:35.273
I'd say the post-mortem interval is 12 to 14 hours.

34:37.920 --> 34:39.478
Cause of death?

34:40.520 --> 34:42.512
Asphyxiation, ligature.

34:45.280 --> 34:47.272
Her nails look newly painted.

34:49.679 --> 34:51.672
Yes, they do.

35:54.040 --> 35:57.590
Victims of strangulation often urinate and defecate at the point of death.

35:58.320 --> 36:00.880
- Yes.
- I'd expect more mess.

36:06.040 --> 36:10.353
He washed her. He washed her and he dried her.

36:12.680 --> 36:14.672
He washed and dried the bedding too.

36:19.800 --> 36:21.996
And then he put her back to bed.

36:24.720 --> 36:27.633
What is it, Mummy? What happened?

36:27.800 --> 36:29.792
There's been an accident, I think.

36:33.600 --> 36:36.672
- Is someone dead?
- I don't know, darling.

36:48.600 --> 36:51.513
<i>How long was he with her after he killed her?</i>

36:54.000 --> 36:55.992
It must have been hours.

37:01.400 --> 37:03.471
Do you think her hair's been clipped?

37:06.360 --> 37:08.352
Where?

37:09.120 --> 37:10.998
There.

38:50.160 --> 38:54.154
Firearm residue found on the hands and clothes of Mclnturff and Dylan.

38:54.720 --> 38:59.431
Fibres from Mclnturff's jacket pocket match those found on the Glock 17.

39:00.520 --> 39:02.671
Bullets retrieved from the body of the victim

39:02.840 --> 39:05.753
match the ammunition found in Rory McNaught's car.

39:10.160 --> 39:12.516
- The man from the PPS he say yes.
- What to?

39:14.200 --> 39:16.192
Yes, sir, I will.

39:17.040 --> 39:20.716
Dylan and Mclnturff with murder, McNaught as an accessory.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.755
Here, break the news to McSwain.

39:29.360 --> 39:31.352
McSwain.

39:37.120 --> 39:39.396
Got the initial lab report.

39:39.720 --> 39:41.712
You're worried about nicotine gum.

39:48.760 --> 39:50.752
You OK?

39:54.040 --> 39:56.032
One of my friends has been killed.

40:00.600 --> 40:02.592
An accident?

40:05.000 --> 40:07.356
No, not an accident.

40:15.280 --> 40:18.079
- I got your things, ma'am.
- Oh, right. Thank you.

40:21.400 --> 40:24.040
I've been thinking I should report myself.

40:24.200 --> 40:28.717
We should never have left her alone that night. We failed her utterly.

40:32.960 --> 40:34.394
Report your partner as well?

40:36.920 --> 40:39.674
You have reported it...to me.

40:42.400 --> 40:44.392
Let me think about it.

40:44.960 --> 40:47.270
I'll decide what action to take tomorrow.

40:48.720 --> 40:50.712
Yes, ma'am.

41:00.680 --> 41:04.390
I'm Detective Superintendent Gibson. I'm leading this inquiry.

41:04.560 --> 41:06.552
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course.

41:06.720 --> 41:08.757
Did you happen to notice your sister's nails?

41:11.000 --> 41:13.834
- No.
- They look freshly painted.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.754
There's not much in the way of nail varnish in the house.

41:17.680 --> 41:19.194
She hardly ever wore it.

41:19.360 --> 41:21.352
Red nail varnish?

41:23.200 --> 41:25.999
Not since she was 16, maybe.

41:28.360 --> 41:30.352
I'm very sorry for your loss.

41:32.320 --> 41:37.190
<i>Police have launched an investigation into a suspicious death at an address in Belfast.</i>

41:37.360 --> 41:40.956
<i>- Detectives have yet to release...</i>
- Paul.

41:41.120 --> 41:42.952
<i>But have confirmed that a post-mortem...</i>

41:43.120 --> 41:45.476
- Paul. <i>- ..is due to take place later today.</i>

41:45.640 --> 41:48.439
<i>This discovery comes just weeks after...</i>

41:52.760 --> 41:54.752
Thanks.

41:57.040 --> 41:59.999
What are you doing here? How did you get through the cordon?

42:00.160 --> 42:03.949
- I'm a police officer, remember?
- Not part of this investigation.

42:05.680 --> 42:08.991
Why did you give me your number if you don't want to see me again?

42:09.160 --> 42:13.916
It was a mistake. I thought I was good at reading people. I'm sorry.

42:14.400 --> 42:16.392
It seems I've read you wrong.

42:28.520 --> 42:30.796
DS Olson signing out.

42:30.960 --> 42:33.953
- Jimmy, what were you doing in there?
- Delivering a message.

42:34.120 --> 42:36.237
To Detective Superintendent Gibson?

42:38.200 --> 42:41.113
- Are you charging Mclnturff and co?
- No comment.

42:41.400 --> 42:42.754
Fine.

42:42.920 --> 42:46.709
Tell your boss from me to stop saying the shooting's drugs related.

42:47.520 --> 42:49.637
Why? Do you know something different?

42:51.840 --> 42:53.718
Who's dead in there?

42:53.880 --> 42:56.349
- Do you know something different?
- Maybe.

42:59.640 --> 43:01.199
All I know is...

43:01.360 --> 43:05.593
white female, early 30s, solicitor at Bacon and Day.

43:07.680 --> 43:09.672
Your turn.

43:23.720 --> 43:25.916
- Is that all right for you?
- Yes.

43:26.080 --> 43:28.072
- That all right?
- Yeah.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.992
<i>I got you something.</i>

44:11.360 --> 44:15.195
Because your teacher said you were trying really hard at school.

44:22.640 --> 44:24.632
Come here. I'll put it on.

44:43.920 --> 44:46.071
- Thank you, Daddy.
- OK.

45:15.360 --> 45:16.430
Katie.

45:16.600 --> 45:19.672
Paul said I could download some music from his computer.

45:19.840 --> 45:21.718
If it's not a good time I can...

45:21.880 --> 45:24.349
- I'm just about to go to work.
- Oh.

45:25.160 --> 45:26.833
OK.

45:27.000 --> 45:31.153
- Do you not have an umbrella or something?
- No.

45:31.320 --> 45:34.279
Jesus, come in, until it eases off at least.

45:51.600 --> 45:53.990
- Jimmy. <i>- I ran into Ned Callan.</i>

45:54.160 --> 45:56.311
<i>- He had quite a story to tell.</i>
- I'm working.

45:56.480 --> 45:58.551
<i>- Aye. Sorry.</i>
- Give me five minutes.

46:11.720 --> 46:14.792
- Come in, gentlemen.
- Good evening. Good to see you.

46:14.960 --> 46:16.952
Take a seat.

46:20.280 --> 46:22.511
Mr Rossmeisl and Mr Lang are here.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.639
- Roger.
- Hey.

46:37.800 --> 46:41.077
Artur. How good to see you. Now, sit down. Relax.

46:41.240 --> 46:44.677
I'd like you to meet the girls of Monroe Air.

47:02.760 --> 47:04.513
Come on.

47:04.680 --> 47:06.876
A glass of champagne, please.

47:07.040 --> 47:09.032
- You're very kind.

47:09.200 --> 47:11.192
Thank you very much.

47:22.280 --> 47:24.272
Is that for her?

47:26.360 --> 47:30.149
She's 15. She's underage.

47:31.240 --> 47:33.232
Don't let her stay too long.

48:43.160 --> 48:45.152
Thanks.

49:00.200 --> 49:02.078
<i>Hi, it's Rob. What's the story?</i>

49:02.240 --> 49:04.197
- Not crime-related at all. <i>- Right.</i>

49:04.360 --> 49:06.352
- Nothing to do with drugs. <i>- OK.</i>

49:07.600 --> 49:11.310
Apparently, Michael Lockwood's been fucking Terry Mclnturff's wife.

49:11.480 --> 49:13.711
<i>- You're joking?</i>
- For the past seven years.

49:13.880 --> 49:16.270
<i>- No.</i>
- Could be the father of Terry's kids.

49:18.480 --> 49:21.279
- Mclnturff just recently found out. <i>- It's beautiful.</i>

49:21.440 --> 49:23.272
His anger knew no bounds.

49:23.440 --> 49:25.636
<i>- Shit, I've gotta go. Talk later.</i>
- OK.

49:37.800 --> 49:39.393
Daddy!

49:40.560 --> 49:43.155
- Daddy, Daddy!

49:43.440 --> 49:45.432
Daddy!

49:59.640 --> 50:01.632
Thank you.

50:14.600 --> 50:18.276
She has a high level of chorionic gonadotropin in her blood.

50:19.280 --> 50:22.398
- What's that?
- I'm thinking she was pregnant.

50:26.000 --> 50:27.957
Oh, Jesus.

50:28.120 --> 50:29.998
She's not really showing, so...

50:30.160 --> 50:32.152
It might be very early stages.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.515
- Do you have kids?
- No.

50:41.680 --> 50:44.070
- You?
- Two girls.

50:51.000 --> 50:52.992
She's erm...ready when you are.

51:24.080 --> 51:26.834
You may see what looks like bruising on her face.

51:27.000 --> 51:31.199
It's not bruising. It's just something that happens when the heart stops.

51:36.640 --> 51:38.632
Are you ready?

51:58.000 --> 52:00.390
Is this the body of your daughter Sarah Kay?

52:03.720 --> 52:05.712
My baby.

52:08.200 --> 52:10.192
My baby.

52:15.040 --> 52:17.032
My baby.

52:18.280 --> 52:20.272
Beautiful baby.

52:29.160 --> 52:31.880
Can I touch her?

52:33.160 --> 52:35.152
Yes, of course.

53:16.960 --> 53:19.156
I bet you sit in here playing air guitar.

53:22.160 --> 53:24.152
Wishing you were black.

53:27.000 --> 53:28.992
Dancing all alone.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.480
I was only joking.

54:09.160 --> 54:11.470
- God, you're strong.
- And you're a thief.

54:14.800 --> 54:16.678
- Give it back.
- What?

54:16.840 --> 54:18.832
You know what.

54:27.120 --> 54:29.112
What are you doing?

54:35.240 --> 54:37.880
No! Get off of me!

55:10.800 --> 55:12.792
You're hurting me.

55:59.600 --> 56:02.160
I wasn't gonna take it.

56:02.320 --> 56:04.471
You had taken it.

56:04.640 --> 56:06.632
I wasn't gonna keep it.

56:07.360 --> 56:09.352
I was just gonna ask about it.

56:10.640 --> 56:12.632
- Ask what?
- Fuck you!

56:13.760 --> 56:15.991
- You hurt my wrist.
- Ask what?

56:16.160 --> 56:18.152
Nothing.

56:25.680 --> 56:29.310
It's my mother's hair. It's all I have of her.

56:31.200 --> 56:33.192
It smells fresh.

56:34.400 --> 56:36.392
I wash it sometimes.

56:45.880 --> 56:47.872
I'm sorry I hurt you.

56:53.840 --> 56:56.036
What can I do to make it up to you?

57:04.760 --> 57:06.752
Kiss it better.

57:07.305 --> 57:13.489
