WEBVTT

00:00.233 --> 00:04.403
        You're gonna get
        through this, mike.
        We both are.

00:04.405 --> 00:05.771
How uncharacteristically
optimistic of you, ryan.

00:05.773 --> 00:07.039
            You should do
            that more often.

00:07.041 --> 00:08.039
What?

00:08.042 --> 00:09.241
            Smile.

00:09.243 --> 00:10.242
Joe said to give you
another chance.

00:10.244 --> 00:12.111
I hope you don't
disappoint him,

00:12.113 --> 00:13.345
But I have a feeling
you will.

00:18.852 --> 00:19.885
                Hello?

00:19.887 --> 00:20.886
            Darling.

00:20.888 --> 00:21.887
                Mom?

00:21.889 --> 00:23.389
    I'm bringing you home.

00:23.391 --> 00:24.790
    Carrie: Lily gray has taken
        center stage

00:24.792 --> 00:27.092
        By impersonating
    carroll and his followers

00:27.094 --> 00:28.861
    In order to free
    her imprisoned son.

00:28.863 --> 00:30.729
You clever
little viper.

00:30.731 --> 00:33.032
            Ryan: We're gonna
            find lily gray
            and joe carroll.

00:33.034 --> 00:34.266
I don't see it.

00:34.268 --> 00:35.300
            Optimism.

00:35.302 --> 00:36.802
        There's a serpent
        in our garden,

00:36.804 --> 00:38.704
        One who seduces
        our troubled

00:38.706 --> 00:40.873
    Brothers and sisters
    with his lies.

00:40.875 --> 00:42.941
        I'm speaking to you,
                joe carroll.

00:42.943 --> 00:44.109
      I'm speaking to you.

00:44.111 --> 00:45.310
            Hello?

00:45.312 --> 00:48.414
Mandy: Mark?
It's mandy.

00:48.416 --> 00:50.549
I got your number
from the classifieds.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.217
        Carroll: If the, uh,
        good preacher wants

00:52.219 --> 00:53.819
        A holy war,

00:53.821 --> 00:55.954
        Then, by hell,
        we'll give him one,

00:55.956 --> 00:59.058
        And the whole world
        shall bear witness.

00:59.060 --> 01:01.160
I'm sorry.
I can explain this.

01:01.162 --> 01:02.094
        Claire: Ryan.

01:07.100 --> 01:08.333
            Claire?

01:15.275 --> 01:16.608
            How?

01:19.045 --> 01:22.848
    Scott, can you clear
    the room, please?

01:22.850 --> 01:24.650
            Ok, fellas.
            Let's go.

01:24.652 --> 01:26.318
    Ryan, I'm sorry.
    Please--

01:26.320 --> 01:27.686
            Get out now.

01:27.688 --> 01:28.854
    I didn't want to
    keep this from you--

01:28.856 --> 01:30.089
            Leave.

01:38.698 --> 01:41.467
You ok?

01:41.469 --> 01:43.135
Ryan, please
say something.

01:43.137 --> 01:45.938
        There's a headstone
        with your name on it.

01:45.940 --> 01:48.173
I'm so sorry.

01:48.175 --> 01:49.608
        I don't understand.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.210
        What happened?

01:51.212 --> 01:53.011
I survived.

01:53.013 --> 01:54.379
They took me straight
from the hospital to witsec

01:54.381 --> 01:56.348
With--with joey
and my mom.

01:56.350 --> 01:59.184
        You were dead.

01:59.186 --> 02:00.319
        That's all I had.

02:00.321 --> 02:01.787
I know.

02:08.661 --> 02:10.829
        Sometimes, I dream...

02:17.403 --> 02:19.171
It's ok.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.875
I'm real.

02:43.363 --> 02:44.863
I begged them
to let me see you,

02:44.865 --> 02:46.331
And they kept talking
about protocol

02:46.333 --> 02:48.333
And secrecy,
and everything

02:48.335 --> 02:50.035
Was happening so fast,
I all I knew was

02:50.037 --> 02:52.037
That I had to
protect joey.

02:52.039 --> 02:53.071
            Did mike know
            where you were?

02:53.073 --> 02:56.241
No. No.
Only that I was alive.

02:56.243 --> 02:58.377
He didn't know where,
so please don't blame him.

02:58.379 --> 03:00.579
        One call. I would have
        joined you.

03:00.581 --> 03:02.014
Just because we thought
joe was dead,

03:02.016 --> 03:03.382
It didn't mean
it was over.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.417
There were others
out there, ryan.

03:05.419 --> 03:07.219
I couldn't ask that
of you.

03:07.221 --> 03:08.754
        That was not your
        decision to make,
        claire.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.088
        That was mine,
        no one else's.

03:10.090 --> 03:11.356
I did it for joey.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.425
It had to be
about him.

03:17.830 --> 03:21.233
            I'm sorry.
            It's not the way
            this should go.

03:25.972 --> 03:28.407
            How's joey?

03:28.409 --> 03:30.576
Uh, it's tough.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.244
My mom's been
great with him.

03:32.246 --> 03:35.214
He's seeing a specialist,
so he's adjusting.

03:35.216 --> 03:36.281
He's better.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.722
            You look good.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.891
The hair?
You kidding me?

03:45.893 --> 03:48.327
It takes a lot of work
to make it look this bad.

03:50.830 --> 03:52.264
            I'm staring
            right at you,

03:52.266 --> 03:55.667
            And I can't believe
            you're here.

03:55.669 --> 03:58.470
Not a day goes by
I don't think about you.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.275
And joe.

04:03.277 --> 04:06.144
This needs to end, ryan.

04:06.146 --> 04:09.081
Living in the shadows
is no way to live.

04:09.083 --> 04:10.616
I want to finish this.

04:10.618 --> 04:13.118
            How?

04:13.120 --> 04:15.487
By killing joe.

04:15.489 --> 04:16.922
            And how are you
            gonna do that?

04:16.923 --> 04:18.490
We can do it together.

04:18.492 --> 04:20.125
I'm the last thing
he's gonna see coming,

04:20.127 --> 04:21.459
So if we can just
surprise him--

04:21.462 --> 04:24.296
            Claire. You need to
            go back to joey.

04:24.298 --> 04:25.497
            You were safe there.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.299
I'm not safe
anywhere, ryan,

04:27.301 --> 04:30.535
And neither is joey,
not until joe is dead.

04:33.239 --> 04:38.644
                Evil comes
        in many disguises.

04:38.646 --> 04:41.680
    Goodness, my friends,

04:41.682 --> 04:44.883
        Does not skulk

04:44.885 --> 04:47.686
Behind some cheap $5.00 mask.

04:47.688 --> 04:50.522
    Goodness shows
    its beautiful face

04:50.524 --> 04:52.491
        To the world.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.960
To all his misguided followers,
        I say to you,

04:54.962 --> 04:56.862
    Joe carroll is not
    the savior.

04:56.864 --> 04:58.497
      He's the antichrist.

04:58.499 --> 05:02.134
    No, sir. There is only
        one true j.C.

05:02.136 --> 05:03.502
    Who brings salvation,

05:03.504 --> 05:05.470
    And that is jesus christ,

05:05.472 --> 05:08.507
    God's only beloved son.

05:08.509 --> 05:11.910
            Amen.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.179
Carrie: Those are
powerful words, pastor.

05:14.181 --> 05:16.815
You just labeled
joe carroll the antichrist.

05:16.817 --> 05:21.420
        Well, the devil takes
        many forms, carrie.

05:21.422 --> 05:22.721
        Carroll is truly
        a disciple

05:22.723 --> 05:24.489
        Of all that is evil,

05:24.491 --> 05:27.693
        And so I say to you,
        joe carroll,

05:27.695 --> 05:28.994
        Your followers,

05:28.996 --> 05:30.996
        Every step you take
        brings you closer

05:30.998 --> 05:33.398
        To the fiery furnaces
        of hell.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.401
        Repent, repent now.

05:36.403 --> 05:38.537
        Beg the lord
        for his forgiveness.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.205
Why have you made
joe carroll

05:40.207 --> 05:41.707
Your sole
mission statement.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.208
        Because it's lucrative,
                        carrie.

05:43.210 --> 05:44.209
    Can't you see
    the man is wearing

05:44.211 --> 05:46.178
        A $5,000 suit?

05:46.180 --> 05:48.447
            Well, joe carroll
            is waging war

05:48.449 --> 05:51.049
            Against religion,
            against god.

05:51.051 --> 05:53.018
            The evil must
            be stopped.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.520
But you're also promoting
your yearly convention,

05:55.522 --> 05:58.623
Which is selling out
at record speed,
I understand.

05:58.625 --> 05:59.791
There wouldn't be
another motive,

05:59.793 --> 06:00.926
Would there, pastor?

06:00.928 --> 06:02.027
    Good girl, carrie.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.595
        Yes. Take the man
            to task.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.030
    Religion is a business,

06:05.032 --> 06:07.799
    And joe carroll is good
    for ticket sales.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.534
    The bloody hypocrite.

06:09.536 --> 06:12.437
            My motive, carrie,
            is to defeat evil.

06:12.439 --> 06:13.438
        Ugh.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.974
            Wherever I may--

06:15.976 --> 06:17.075
                You really hate
                this man?

06:17.077 --> 06:20.145
      Oh, I hate religion.

06:20.147 --> 06:22.247
    I hate the hypocrisy
        of it,

06:22.249 --> 06:25.817
    And that man exemplifies
        precisely that.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.152
Do you even believe
in god, joe?

06:27.154 --> 06:30.222
    Please. Whose god?
        Heh heh.

06:30.224 --> 06:33.158
    You know, there are
    over 2,000 gods

06:33.160 --> 06:37.963
    That the sheep of this world
    have chosen to believe in.

06:37.965 --> 06:40.499
        So, no. No.
        I do not believe

06:40.501 --> 06:41.600
        In any god.

06:41.602 --> 06:43.969
        No. I made that
        mistake once before,

06:43.971 --> 06:45.670
        And I'm not about
        to make it again.

06:45.672 --> 06:47.406
        It's men like
        kingston tanner

06:47.408 --> 06:53.645
        That preach nothing
        but--but lies.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.847
You know, religion is
responsible

06:55.849 --> 07:00.452
For far more bloodshed
than I could ever be.

07:00.454 --> 07:05.424
It's only good
for one thing--power,

07:05.426 --> 07:08.794
And death is its--
is its greatest ally.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.195
        But why choose
        kingston tanner

07:10.197 --> 07:11.329
        As your target?

07:11.331 --> 07:14.433
Oh, no, no. No.
He chose me.

07:14.435 --> 07:15.867
He's been taking
my name in vain

07:15.869 --> 07:18.637
To increase his coffers,

07:18.639 --> 07:20.305
So I thought it best
to teach the man a lesson

07:20.307 --> 07:25.510
And show the world what
religion truly represents.

07:25.512 --> 07:26.511
            And we will.

07:29.916 --> 07:32.684
            Oh, has, uh--has
            tilda called in yet?

07:32.686 --> 07:34.619
                Not yet.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.688
            Um, have you
            seen mandy?

07:36.690 --> 07:37.889
            She wasn't
            at breakfast.

07:37.891 --> 07:40.325
        Oh. She's probably
        sleeping in.

07:40.327 --> 07:42.060
            She's not
            in her cabin either.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.529
        Well, she's around
        here somewhere.

07:44.531 --> 07:46.965
Carrie: Thank you,
pastor tanner,
for joining us today.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.166
            The pleasure's
            all mine.

08:25.638 --> 08:28.573
Hey, hey, hey.
It's just me.

08:28.575 --> 08:30.208
You can put that away.

08:35.681 --> 08:36.948
            You scared me.

08:41.386 --> 08:42.721
            Who are they?

08:42.722 --> 08:44.756
They came along
to protect us.

08:44.758 --> 08:47.792
How are you, mandy?

08:47.794 --> 08:49.761
We've missed you.

08:49.763 --> 08:51.897
            Where is your mom?
            Where's luke?

08:51.899 --> 08:54.032
        It's probably safer
    I don't give you a location,

08:54.034 --> 08:57.369
    But you'll see them
    soon enough.

08:57.371 --> 08:58.904
        Where's joe?

08:58.906 --> 09:00.639
            I left joe.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.140
            I told you that
            on the phone.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.242
I know,
but where is he?

09:04.244 --> 09:05.744
            I can't tell you.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.712
            He doesn't want
            anyone to know.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.948
Hey.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.217
It's just us.

09:12.219 --> 09:12.918
Come on. Where is he?

09:16.589 --> 09:19.057
            I'm sorry, mark.
            I can't tell you.

09:23.329 --> 09:26.998
Ok. No worries.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.667
It's really cold.

09:28.669 --> 09:29.968
Let's get moving.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.169
It's a long drive.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.171
        That would be nice.

09:33.173 --> 09:34.940
            Mother is so
            looking forward
            to seeing you.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.942
            She's baking a cake.

09:36.944 --> 09:38.810
            Do you like
            chocolate?

09:38.812 --> 09:40.645
Who doesn't
like chocolate?

09:40.647 --> 09:42.681
            Huh.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.316
            This way.

09:49.055 --> 09:51.823
Thank you, pastor.
It was a great segment.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.625
I hope your convention
is a huge success.

09:53.627 --> 09:55.694
            We did the lord's
            work today, carrie.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.028
            Bless you.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.200
            Thank you.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.672
A little more, huh?
That's good.

10:16.482 --> 10:18.116
        [horn honks]

10:27.259 --> 10:28.727
        What's she doing?

10:33.165 --> 10:35.533
        Step away
        from the car.

10:35.535 --> 10:37.636
        Unh!

10:44.644 --> 10:45.710
It's for you.

10:49.815 --> 10:51.149
            Hello?

10:51.151 --> 10:52.817
Miss cooke,
it's joe carroll.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.886
I'm gonna give you
a world exclusive.

10:54.888 --> 10:57.756
I'm gonna need you
to broadcast a new
message from me.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.891
Failure to obey me
will result

10:59.893 --> 11:01.860
In your death
and the death

11:01.862 --> 11:05.897
Of everyone you hold dear,
et cetera, et cetera.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.365
Have a good day now.

11:27.353 --> 11:28.887
            Carrie.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.760
    You ok?

11:35.762 --> 11:37.195
            Better than
            my bodyguards.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.296
            One of them
            got it bad.

11:38.298 --> 11:39.798
            He's in
            intensive care.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.032
Sorry.

11:44.303 --> 11:45.770
            It was joe carroll.

11:45.772 --> 11:47.205
            He sent me
            a message.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.407
            Just know I've
            made a copy.

11:49.409 --> 11:50.809
            Have you looked
            at it?

11:50.811 --> 11:53.611
No. I've been questioned
nonstop.

11:53.613 --> 11:55.547
            He said he'd kill
            me if I didn't
            broadcast it.

11:55.549 --> 11:56.614
            He's up to
            something.

11:56.616 --> 11:57.949
            It's happening
            today.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.484
We need to get you
someplace safe.

11:59.486 --> 12:00.952
You've got full protection
from this second on.

12:00.954 --> 12:02.487
You don't go
to the bathroom
by yourself,

12:02.489 --> 12:03.755
Do you understand?

12:03.757 --> 12:04.956
            Safest thing for me
            to do, ryan,

12:04.958 --> 12:06.491
            Is to air
            this video.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.426
It could be a coded message
from joe to his followers.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.128
            I don't care.
            If I refuse,

12:10.130 --> 12:11.963
            He kills me
            and my family.

12:11.965 --> 12:13.231
Please just wait
until I've looked
at it, all right?

12:13.233 --> 12:15.934
Don't do anything
without talking to me.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.435
            Please.

12:18.938 --> 12:21.239
            Can I spend
            the night?

12:21.241 --> 12:25.009
            I feel safer
            at your place
            with you.

12:25.011 --> 12:28.646
I'm gonna find you later,
and we'll talk then, ok?

12:28.648 --> 12:32.016
I want you to do
everything that your
security detail asks.

12:32.018 --> 12:34.953
You got to stay safe.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.621
Ok?

12:36.623 --> 12:38.623
            Yeah, of course.

12:38.625 --> 12:39.824
                        Call me.

12:48.234 --> 12:50.869
        ¶ we're here ¶

12:50.871 --> 12:53.371
Hello, sweetie.

12:53.373 --> 12:54.839
How are you?

12:54.841 --> 12:56.374
        Where am I?

12:56.376 --> 12:57.842
Somewhere safe.

12:57.844 --> 13:01.212
Let me get a look
at you. Ha ha!

13:01.214 --> 13:04.816
I've missed you.
How have you been?

13:04.818 --> 13:06.985
        Fine.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.486
            She won't tell me
            where joe is.

13:08.488 --> 13:12.023
That's ok.
We have mandy.

13:12.025 --> 13:14.292
        Who needs joe?

13:14.294 --> 13:17.295
    Let's get you inside
    somewhere warm.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.843
        Claire: So carrie cooke
        gave this to you,

13:31.845 --> 13:33.645
The woman who wrote
the book?

13:33.647 --> 13:35.647
        She was trying
        to be helpful.

13:37.850 --> 13:41.219
    In the name of god,
    churches have waged
    war for profit,

13:41.221 --> 13:44.022
      Religions have tortured
            and killed,

13:44.024 --> 13:45.857
    False prophets have used
        faith to mask

13:45.859 --> 13:49.727
        Their own sins
        and deceit,

13:49.729 --> 13:52.931
        Masks they refuse
        to remove.

13:52.933 --> 13:55.066
        Well, I dare to
        expose them,

13:55.068 --> 14:00.071
    And even if I have to rip
    their flesh in the process,

14:00.073 --> 14:03.074
        Their masks
        will be removed.

14:03.076 --> 14:07.011
Hypocrites like kingston tanner,
living in his luxury mansion,

14:07.013 --> 14:09.080
                Will be exposed.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.515
    If there is a god,

14:10.517 --> 14:13.451
    Then I am his creation,

14:13.453 --> 14:15.753
      And I am the truth.

14:15.755 --> 14:20.258
    His own son said,
    "do not think I came
    to bring peace on earth.

14:20.260 --> 14:26.030
    I did not come to bring
    peace but a sword."

14:26.032 --> 14:31.636
    His own son said,
    "do not think I came
    to bring peace on earth."

14:31.638 --> 14:33.972
Joe quoting the bible,
that's new.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.940
His family was
very religious.

14:35.942 --> 14:39.077
He always had a lot
of anger when it
came to religion.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.945
He became an atheist.

14:40.947 --> 14:42.313
            One more thing
            we have in common.

14:47.052 --> 14:49.053
            I believe in god.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.154
            God is hope,

14:50.156 --> 14:53.124
            And there is
            always hope.

14:53.126 --> 14:56.294
        This coming from
        the woman that wants
        to kill her ex-husband.

14:56.296 --> 14:57.996
I'm not a saint, ryan.

15:02.034 --> 15:04.135
So joe is waging war

15:04.137 --> 15:05.970
        On god and religion.

15:05.972 --> 15:07.071
        You know,
        kingston tanner's been

15:07.073 --> 15:08.406
        Talking about him a lot
        in the press.

15:08.408 --> 15:12.076
        He could be joe's
        next target.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.945
        Joe's quoting "matthew."

15:13.947 --> 15:16.814
        "jesus said, I did not
        come to bring peace
        but a sword,"

15:16.816 --> 15:18.116
        But he omitted
        the last part--

15:18.118 --> 15:20.118
    "I came to set a man
    against his father

15:20.120 --> 15:21.920
    And a daughter
    against her mother."

15:21.922 --> 15:24.355
        Does tanner have
        children?

15:24.357 --> 15:25.990
I'm gonna call clarke
and let him know
what's going on.

15:25.992 --> 15:28.092
        Or we could just
        go ourselves.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.961
        Listen. If this could
        lead us to joe,

15:29.963 --> 15:31.195
        I don't want anyone
        getting in the way

15:31.197 --> 15:33.464
        Of us putting
        a bullet in is head.

15:35.734 --> 15:37.435
        Kingston tanner has
        one son.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.370
        He goes to northfield
        in connecticut.
        Great. Let's go.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.806
        No, no. I'm not
        gonna put you in that
        kind of jeopardy.

15:41.808 --> 15:44.175
Ryan, I'm not
a victim. I'm here.
I'm here to help.

15:44.177 --> 15:45.777
        And what about
        the marshals
        in the hall?

15:45.779 --> 15:47.178
        They're not gonna let
        you out of their sight.

15:47.180 --> 15:50.048
Oh, like you don't
know how to slip them.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.115
        Ohh.

15:51.117 --> 15:54.052
        All right.

15:54.054 --> 15:55.820
        Give me 10 minutes
        to distract them.

15:55.822 --> 15:57.722
        I'll text you
        when you're clear
        to come down.

15:57.724 --> 15:58.957
    Ok.

16:14.840 --> 16:16.808
        Mike told me.
        You ok?

16:16.810 --> 16:18.176
            Yeah, I'm good.

16:18.178 --> 16:19.377
    Why'd she show up?
        Why now?

16:19.379 --> 16:20.979
            Let's talk
            about it later.

16:20.981 --> 16:22.013
            I think
            kingston tanner's
            son may be

16:22.015 --> 16:23.815
            Joe's next target.

16:23.817 --> 16:26.017
Wait. The
televangelist's son?

16:26.019 --> 16:27.018
            Yeah.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.052
Where is he?

16:28.054 --> 16:29.487
            Northfield college.

16:29.489 --> 16:30.755
            I need you to
            go back to
            the apartment,

16:30.757 --> 16:32.023
            Get me
            a campus address

16:32.025 --> 16:33.224
            And any other
            information you can

16:33.226 --> 16:34.225
            Dig up on this
            kid, ok?

16:34.227 --> 16:35.226
            Will do.

16:35.228 --> 16:37.428
    Hey. Keep an eye
    on claire, all right?

16:37.430 --> 16:38.696
    She's gonna be mad
    that I left her up there.

16:38.698 --> 16:40.164
            What, me?

16:40.166 --> 16:41.366
            I've never
            even met her.

16:41.368 --> 16:43.234
      Introduce yourself.

16:43.236 --> 16:44.402
                She'll like you.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.750
      [cell phone chimes]

17:12.131 --> 17:14.531
Uh, claire. Hi. I'm max.
I'm ryan's niece.

17:14.534 --> 17:17.268
            Hi. Where's ryan?

17:17.270 --> 17:18.269
He left.

17:18.271 --> 17:19.303
                        He left?

17:19.305 --> 17:20.538
Yeah. I mean,
you know ryan.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.806
He was never gonna
let you go.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.074
            He went to
            the college alone.

17:23.076 --> 17:24.541
He's with mike.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.077
            [sighs]

17:48.100 --> 17:50.835
Frat house is just
around the corner.

17:50.837 --> 17:51.969
Let's drive around
a little,

17:51.971 --> 17:53.271
Work out
escape routes.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.273
      [knocking on window]

17:58.944 --> 18:01.145
      Afternoon, officer.
      Is there a problem?

18:01.147 --> 18:02.914
What business do you
have on campus?

18:02.916 --> 18:04.515
    Oh. Well, we're, uh--
    we're visiting a friend,

18:04.517 --> 18:07.151
    But I think maybe
    I wrote down
    the address wrong.

18:07.153 --> 18:11.289
    Perhaps you could, uh--
    you could take a look.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.191
Please stay in the car.

18:13.193 --> 18:15.159
        I'm sorry.

18:15.161 --> 18:16.961
    We're gonna need you
    to come with us.

18:22.968 --> 18:24.602
        [grunting]

18:24.604 --> 18:25.803
Hold it.

18:32.277 --> 18:33.211

18:49.561 --> 18:51.329
I want you to understand
about claire.

18:51.331 --> 18:52.363
            You don't have
            to explain.

18:52.365 --> 18:55.299
I need to.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.969
This happened right
after we dug up debra.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.337
Her face was still
in my head,

18:59.339 --> 19:00.805
And there was no way
I was gonna let

19:00.807 --> 19:04.041

end up that way.

19:04.043 --> 19:06.210
I mean, you were
in surgery.

19:06.212 --> 19:09.347
I asked myself what
you would want for claire,

19:09.349 --> 19:12.350
And I knew that you would
put claire's safety

19:12.352 --> 19:15.019
Above everything else,

19:15.021 --> 19:16.554
Even your own feelings.

19:16.556 --> 19:18.823
            Ok.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.158
I wanted to tell you.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.259
            I got it, mike.

19:23.695 --> 19:24.996

19:46.652 --> 19:47.952
            What is this?

19:47.954 --> 19:49.687

the surveillance cameras.

19:53.458 --> 19:55.226
Mandy last night.

19:59.064 --> 20:03.034
She left, joe.
She's gone.

20:04.536 --> 20:07.772
Lily: I thought,
"lovely mandy's coming.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.307
What should we have?"

20:09.309 --> 20:12.043
Then I thought,
"chocolate cake.

20:12.045 --> 20:15.479
Mandy's sure to adore
chocolate cake."

20:15.481 --> 20:19.250
Go on. Have a lick.
Ha ha ha!

20:24.323 --> 20:25.423
            Hmm?

20:25.425 --> 20:26.457
Mm-hmm.

20:26.459 --> 20:28.159
            Ha ha ha!

20:31.663 --> 20:33.431
            I like this house.

20:33.433 --> 20:34.732
            Is it yours, too?

20:34.734 --> 20:36.901
I have secret homes
across the world, mandy.

20:36.903 --> 20:39.337
            Will we go see them?

20:39.339 --> 20:42.473
That depends.

20:42.475 --> 20:43.507
                        On what?

20:47.779 --> 20:50.114
I had such dreams
for us--

20:50.116 --> 20:54.485
Venezuela, sand,
sun, love.

20:54.487 --> 20:56.320
            I wanted that, too.

20:56.322 --> 20:59.323
It didn't happen,
though, did it?

20:59.325 --> 21:01.826
My beautiful family
was destroyed,

21:01.828 --> 21:03.761
My son brutally beaten
and imprisoned,

21:03.763 --> 21:07.865
And you--you left
me for joe.

21:07.867 --> 21:10.935
            I'm sorry, lily.
            I truly am.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.037
            Everything was
            so confusing.

21:13.039 --> 21:15.506
            I had no choice
            but to go with him.

21:15.508 --> 21:18.476
So now you've chosen me.

21:18.478 --> 21:21.712
Please understand
that this time

21:21.714 --> 21:24.515
I need to be certain
you won't betray me.

21:24.517 --> 21:28.152
            I won't.
            I promise.

21:28.154 --> 21:30.354
                Good.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.358
So tell me where joe is.

21:36.461 --> 21:40.331
            Joe is like a father
            to me, lily.

21:40.333 --> 21:41.532
            I don't want to be
            with him,

21:41.534 --> 21:43.868
            But I can't
            betray him.
            I'm sorry.

21:43.870 --> 21:46.871
            Mandy dear,

21:46.873 --> 21:49.707
            I just want to
            make things right
            with joe.

21:49.709 --> 21:52.810
            I do not intend
            to bring him harm.

21:52.812 --> 21:56.914
Miss lily, I was born
at night but not last night.

21:56.916 --> 21:58.916
I know better.

21:58.918 --> 22:00.718
I want to be a part
of your family,

22:00.720 --> 22:03.220
And I will do anything
you want me to,

22:03.222 --> 22:06.757
But we have to consider
this issue closed.

Where is he, mandy?

22:21.040 --> 22:24.542
            I can't tell you.

22:24.544 --> 22:28.212
And I can't tell you
how sad I am to hear that.

22:35.554 --> 22:38.389

a little crazy out here.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.441

24:03.443 --> 24:05.509
            He's been
            doing well.

24:05.511 --> 24:09.113
I'm glad.
He looks healthy, sober.

24:09.115 --> 24:10.214
Is he going
to meetings?

24:10.216 --> 24:12.616
            He was
            up until this.

24:12.618 --> 24:14.885
            Yeah, he's doing ok.

24:14.887 --> 24:16.487
            He had a good year,

24:16.489 --> 24:19.523
            Or, you know, I did
            with him.

24:19.525 --> 24:22.560

            thought you died,

24:31.304 --> 24:32.536
            He fell apart.

24:32.538 --> 24:36.707
I hated what I did
to him,

24:36.709 --> 24:38.642
But I had to do what
was best for my son.

24:38.644 --> 24:40.244
            And I get that,
            I do.

            excuse me,

do this to me?

        tell them where you are.

        That ship sailed.

35:29.328 --> 35:32.129
        I'm truly touched by
        mandy's loyalty to you,

35:32.131 --> 35:34.030
        Especially since
        you abandoned her.

35:34.032 --> 35:37.400
Don't you listen
to her, mouse.

35:37.402 --> 35:39.169
I did not abandon you.

35:39.171 --> 35:42.239
        No? Then why did she
        come running to me?

        Why don't I give you

would I do that?
