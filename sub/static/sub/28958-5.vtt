WEBVTT

00:01.746 --> 00:03.096
My name is Talon.

00:03.146 --> 00:04.682
I'm the last Blackblood,
or so I've been told.

00:04.705 --> 00:07.536
I escaped when Everit Dred
killed all my people.

00:07.586 --> 00:10.546
I cut off the points of my
ears to hide in plain sight.

00:10.586 --> 00:12.676
A tiny creature lives inside me,

00:12.716 --> 00:14.546
passed to me by my dying mother.

00:14.586 --> 00:17.726
It gives me the power to open
portals to another world

00:17.766 --> 00:19.986
and summon powerful demons
called Lu-Qiri.

00:20.026 --> 00:22.206
But I can only summon them
when I have their names,

00:22.246 --> 00:24.466
something that's proving
to be a challenge.

00:24.516 --> 00:27.386
The Prime Order wants me dead,
but I've found sanctuary

00:27.426 --> 00:30.436
at the farthest edge of the Realm
in a place known as the Outpost.

00:30.476 --> 00:32.436
Previously on "The Outpost"...

00:32.476 --> 00:36.616
She's a false queen. The girl in the
portrait looked a lot like Gwynn.

00:36.656 --> 00:39.746
But the real Rosmund
had a misshapen face.

00:39.786 --> 00:41.396
You have to promise
to help the Queen.

00:41.446 --> 00:43.292
With a Lu-Qiri army,
she can defeat the Prime Order.

00:43.316 --> 00:46.226
Help me summon my kinsmen and
we will win your war for you.

00:46.276 --> 00:49.796
You have my word.

00:49.846 --> 00:52.456
So you want me to give up
all of my advantage

00:52.496 --> 00:54.236
to save some human woman
I've never met.

00:54.286 --> 00:57.196
- Yes.
- Talon will never give in to your demands.

00:57.246 --> 00:59.506
Looks like you aren't the One.

01:02.946 --> 01:04.686
I may not be the One...

01:04.726 --> 01:06.816
but neither are you.

01:06.856 --> 01:09.036
I'm heading out
to bring my son's body back.

01:09.076 --> 01:11.956
- Garret!
- What say you, Mr. Spears?

01:11.996 --> 01:13.696
I am yours.

01:17.476 --> 01:19.476
Please, Majesty,
can you stand still?

01:19.526 --> 01:20.916
Janzo said I should apply this

01:20.956 --> 01:23.746
several times a day
to prevent scarring.

01:23.786 --> 01:25.616
She's going to be angry with me.

01:25.656 --> 01:29.536
You are her queen.
She'll understand.

01:29.576 --> 01:31.536
What will I understand?

01:31.576 --> 01:35.326
Talon, you're here.
And without a knock.

01:35.366 --> 01:37.676
Shall I leave so you two
can finish talking about me?

01:37.716 --> 01:40.196
Oh, stop it.
Come, please, sit down.

01:47.986 --> 01:51.996
After the events of yesterday,
seeing those demons fight,

01:52.036 --> 01:55.126
and learning that there are more
Blackbloods out there like that Rebb,

01:55.166 --> 01:59.216
Talon, I no longer think it's
wise to summon a demon army.

01:59.256 --> 02:02.876
You said yourself that you didn't
think you could control a whole army.

02:02.916 --> 02:06.046
But you need an army to defend
yourself against the Prime Order,

02:06.096 --> 02:08.786
which is no doubt
already on its way.

02:08.836 --> 02:12.356
Look, I just...
I just need some time.

02:12.406 --> 02:14.626
Zed may have answers.
He can help.

02:15.886 --> 02:18.366
- Zed?
- Yeah. He, um,

02:18.406 --> 02:20.106
he's another Blackblood.

02:20.146 --> 02:21.546
Another Blackblood?

02:21.586 --> 02:24.326
It was his demon
that helped save you.

02:24.376 --> 02:25.482
That doesn't mean
he would fight for me.

02:25.506 --> 02:27.116
Clearly, Blackbloods
are dangerous.

02:29.636 --> 02:31.092
- You're not serious, are you?
- I don't mean you, Talon.

02:31.116 --> 02:32.816
You're part of this world.

02:32.856 --> 02:33.816
They were part
of this world, too,

02:33.856 --> 02:35.126
before they were betrayed.

02:35.166 --> 02:37.736
Okay, enough.
We will find another way.

02:37.776 --> 02:39.216
One that doesn't
include monsters.

02:43.046 --> 02:46.396
And by monsters,
I assume you mean Lu-Qiri.

02:46.436 --> 02:49.176
Talon, before yesterday I'd
never actually seen a Lu-Qiri.

02:49.226 --> 02:51.486
Now I've stood face to face
with one up close.

02:51.526 --> 02:53.356
I know how dangerous they are.

02:53.396 --> 02:55.332
They're only dangerous in the
command of dangerous people.

02:55.356 --> 02:56.666
You mean dangerous Blackbloods.

03:00.186 --> 03:02.326
You will send the demon back,

03:02.366 --> 03:04.196
and the Blackblood
that came with it.

03:04.236 --> 03:05.676
Do it today.

03:05.716 --> 03:07.156
Vikka and Zed.

03:07.196 --> 03:09.416
- I'm sorry?
- Their names.

03:09.456 --> 03:11.066
You should at least
know their names

03:11.116 --> 03:12.702
before you send them back
to that horrible place.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.465
They saved your life.

03:14.505 --> 03:17.165
- Talon...
- It's an order, right?

03:17.205 --> 03:19.075
It is.

03:24.035 --> 03:25.515
As you wish, my Queen.

03:27.000 --> 03:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:44.455 --> 03:45.455
Stables.

03:49.975 --> 03:51.975
Ah.

03:52.025 --> 03:53.155
Here you go.

03:57.555 --> 03:59.465
A fine morning to you, sir.

03:59.505 --> 04:01.231
It will be a lot finer with
a piece of meat in me belly

04:01.255 --> 04:03.035
and a good bed to keep in.

04:04.775 --> 04:07.515
I started out
on the Watch meself.

04:07.565 --> 04:09.645
Not in as fine a place
as this, mind you.

04:09.695 --> 04:12.735
Oh, do you still serve?

04:12.785 --> 04:14.435
I do indeed.

04:14.485 --> 04:16.394
No finer honor
than to serve The Three.

04:16.435 --> 04:18.834
It's what brings me
to the Capital.

04:18.875 --> 04:23.965
I'm a Gate Marshal, tracking an
escaped prisoner badly wounded.

04:24.015 --> 04:26.251
I think the Ambassador may have
picked him up along the way.

04:26.275 --> 04:28.455
Did you happen
to see him come by?

04:28.495 --> 04:31.105
Yeah. Dred rode in here
with a prisoner,

04:31.145 --> 04:34.805
and buckets of blood
leaking from that one.

04:34.845 --> 04:37.985
Probably dead by now.

04:38.025 --> 04:42.905
Well, uh, I'm supposed
to pick him up dead or alive.

04:42.945 --> 04:44.985
Do you know where
I might find him?

04:45.035 --> 04:49.085
Well, they would have taken him
to the Institute either way.

04:49.125 --> 04:51.305
Might check
with the Watch there.

04:53.785 --> 04:55.305
I will indeed.

04:55.345 --> 04:57.435
Thanks for your help.

04:57.485 --> 04:59.265
Now go get some rest, huh?

04:59.305 --> 05:01.315
Thank you, sir.

05:06.615 --> 05:09.275
No, no, no.

05:09.315 --> 05:11.925
- No?
- Yes. No, Naya.

05:11.975 --> 05:13.365
Every time you come in here,

05:13.405 --> 05:15.015
you come in
and think up some new idea

05:15.065 --> 05:17.025
about how I can
humiliate myself,

05:17.065 --> 05:19.285
and I'm very respectfully done.

05:19.325 --> 05:20.855
No.

05:20.895 --> 05:23.815
The kiss didn't work then?

05:23.855 --> 05:26.555
No, it didn't work, Naya.

05:26.595 --> 05:28.855
Well, um, you're not dead,

05:28.905 --> 05:30.815
so it must not
have gone too horribly.

05:30.865 --> 05:32.955
No, not too horribly at all.

05:32.995 --> 05:34.735
Actually, do you know
what she said to me?

05:34.775 --> 05:37.045
She said that maybe eventually

05:37.085 --> 05:39.605
she might love me
in 30 or 40 moons.

05:39.655 --> 05:43.135
So why don't you just go
and check back with me then?

05:43.175 --> 05:45.045
I'm sorry it didn't go
as well as I expected.

05:55.845 --> 05:57.755
Um, show me.

05:57.805 --> 05:59.845
Show you what?

05:59.895 --> 06:02.805
Show me how you kissed her.

06:02.845 --> 06:06.945
Um, for purely scientific
reasons, so, um,

06:06.985 --> 06:10.645
you know, I can understand what
you could have done differently.

06:10.685 --> 06:13.995
Well, it won't be an exact recreation
because we're in a different room

06:14.035 --> 06:16.085
and you're much smaller
than Talon...

06:16.125 --> 06:17.825
Janzo.

06:18.905 --> 06:19.915
All right.

06:29.925 --> 06:31.575
Mm.

06:38.975 --> 06:41.545
No.

06:41.585 --> 06:44.325
You couldn't have done
anything differently.

06:44.365 --> 06:47.025
That was, um, perfect.

06:48.285 --> 06:50.245
Janzo!

06:50.285 --> 06:52.765
- Janzo.
- Yes, Mum?

07:02.125 --> 07:04.345
Gods. Did you rob a treasury?

07:04.385 --> 07:08.175
You know as well as I do that the
treasury is about as empty as Munt's head.

07:08.215 --> 07:12.135
This is all mine.

07:12.175 --> 07:15.185
Mine, mine, mine,
and your Auntie's turning up in a minute.

07:15.225 --> 07:17.185
Right, although you do realize

07:17.225 --> 07:20.315
that that doesn't
explain any of this.

07:20.365 --> 07:21.755
Indeed, Elinor.

07:21.795 --> 07:22.991
Please do explain all of this.

07:23.015 --> 07:24.585
Morning, Aunt Gertie.

07:24.625 --> 07:26.675
Morning, Janzo.

07:26.715 --> 07:30.935
Well, sister? You insisted
I visit you this morning.

07:30.985 --> 07:33.335
Is it to apologize
for our last encounter

07:33.375 --> 07:35.685
or help you with your counting?

07:35.725 --> 07:37.045
You never were
very good at maths.

07:38.815 --> 07:40.385
Have a seat, sister.

07:40.425 --> 07:43.425
Janzo, wine. Best we've got
and a couple of glasses.

07:43.475 --> 07:46.305
Right. It's just you realize
we only have one type of wine

07:46.345 --> 07:47.785
and it's not really very good.

07:47.825 --> 07:49.785
Janzo, your auntie's
getting older by the second.

07:56.965 --> 07:58.445
What are you laughing at?

07:58.485 --> 08:00.015
You, Elinor.

08:01.535 --> 08:04.015
Is this because
I called you poor?

08:04.055 --> 08:06.105
You want to prove
that you're wealthier than me?

08:06.145 --> 08:08.455
Well, my dear sister,
I freely admit it.

08:08.495 --> 08:11.805
I have no wealth of my own.

08:11.845 --> 08:14.285
But I live in a mansion
the size of this whole Outpost.

08:14.325 --> 08:16.985
I have servants
that wait on me day and night.

08:17.025 --> 08:20.425
And I have the ear
of the future king.

08:20.465 --> 08:23.595
It's not about money,
dear sister.

08:24.905 --> 08:26.735
It's about power.

08:29.735 --> 08:34.615
Well, if it's about power then,
dear sister,

08:34.655 --> 08:36.825
you don't have a pot to pee in.

08:36.875 --> 08:38.965
Gods, where did
you learn this language?

08:39.005 --> 08:41.485
Right here.

08:41.534 --> 08:46.055
While you were away getting a
proper education with your father,

08:46.095 --> 08:48.585
I was here learning
something much more important.

08:48.625 --> 08:51.585
Oh? And what's that?

08:51.625 --> 08:53.015
People.

08:53.065 --> 08:56.285
I learnt a lot about people.

08:56.325 --> 08:58.765
You see, I learnt
how to read people,

08:58.805 --> 09:00.675
what they want,
what they don't want.

09:00.725 --> 09:04.465
And let me tell you something,
Gwynn doesn't want your Baron,

09:04.505 --> 09:07.905
so you don't have
the future king's ear.

09:07.945 --> 09:12.605
You have the ear
of a spoiled rotten lout.

09:20.135 --> 09:24.265
Your Majesty, my soldiers
cannot continue at this pace.

09:24.315 --> 09:28.665
Their hands are bleeding. Day and
night they are digging the trenches,

09:28.705 --> 09:31.845
even though we've got nothing to
line them with but sharp sticks.

09:31.885 --> 09:33.845
We need steel, Your Majesty.

09:33.885 --> 09:36.365
Not just for our defenses,
but for our men.

09:36.415 --> 09:39.375
There's steel in those mines,
begging your pardon, my Queen,

09:39.415 --> 09:41.505
just waiting to be forged,

09:41.545 --> 09:44.545
and men willing to go in,
but for a fair day's wage.

09:44.595 --> 09:47.295
- Wait your turn, sir.
- I've been waiting all day.

09:47.335 --> 09:49.295
Me, too.
There is no food.

09:49.335 --> 09:51.075
How is she going to pay
your miners, huh?

09:51.125 --> 09:53.125
How about she stops
paying your soldiers?

09:59.394 --> 10:00.874
Enough.

10:00.914 --> 10:02.394
Enough!

10:03.564 --> 10:05.744
Your problems are my problems,

10:05.784 --> 10:08.444
but we must unite together
to solve them.

10:08.484 --> 10:11.274
I will not stand here
and lie to you.

10:11.314 --> 10:13.794
I cannot snap my fingers
and alleviate our woes.

10:13.834 --> 10:15.624
Not without a little time.

10:15.664 --> 10:18.934
I know we need more men
and the money to arm them.

10:18.974 --> 10:22.414
And I know that the solution
is in the mines.

10:22.454 --> 10:25.674
But I cannot ask men to work
without a way to pay them.

10:25.724 --> 10:29.684
What about the food?

10:29.724 --> 10:34.424
Captain Orlick, how much grain is
left in the winter storehouses?

10:34.464 --> 10:36.554
That's for the soldiers,
Your Majesty.

10:36.604 --> 10:39.164
Not anymore.

10:39.214 --> 10:42.914
My rightful claim to the throne
has put us in a tenuous position,

10:42.954 --> 10:46.954
but I will not have
starving subjects.

10:47.004 --> 10:49.874
Start rationing the food.
That will help for now.

10:49.914 --> 10:52.964
Thank you.
Thank you, Your Grace.

10:53.004 --> 10:58.714
You have my word, I will find a
way to solve all these problems.

10:58.754 --> 11:00.234
You're not alone.

11:24.694 --> 11:25.954
What do you think?

11:25.994 --> 11:27.524
When I suggested we go
for a walk,

11:27.564 --> 11:30.614
I was hoping to see
a bit more of the Capital.

11:30.654 --> 11:33.654
You're still healing, Garret.

11:33.704 --> 11:37.574
Besides, I want to be by your
side as you walk those streets

11:37.614 --> 11:40.234
and learn about our home.

12:05.994 --> 12:07.734
I've missed you.

12:07.774 --> 12:08.734
How can you miss me, silly?

12:08.784 --> 12:11.264
I never left your side.

12:19.664 --> 12:21.484
Have you taken your medication?

12:21.534 --> 12:25.184
Not yet today.

12:25.234 --> 12:27.794
Take it now.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.024
Of course.

13:08.234 --> 13:09.974
You summoned me, Your Majesty?

13:10.014 --> 13:11.804
I did indeed.

13:11.844 --> 13:14.624
I wanted to thank you for trying
to save me from my captor.

13:14.674 --> 13:17.374
It was very brave.

13:17.414 --> 13:19.154
How are feeling?

13:19.194 --> 13:24.164
- Never been better.
- You're drunk.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.464
I'm celebrating our engagement.

13:26.514 --> 13:29.774
That's funny. I don't recalled
accepting your proposal, Master Tobin.

13:29.814 --> 13:32.954
Well, Your Majesty,
seeing as your...

13:32.994 --> 13:35.784
Your coffers are empty,
your battlements are unmanned,

13:35.824 --> 13:37.954
and your three days are long up,

13:38.004 --> 13:39.174
I was feeling confident.

13:39.214 --> 13:40.524
So shall we celebrate together?

13:40.564 --> 13:42.434
Yeah?

13:42.484 --> 13:44.704
But I have nothing to drink to.

13:44.744 --> 13:47.134
- Okay.
- You're right.

13:47.184 --> 13:50.094
Nothing has changed
since your proposed marriage.

13:50.144 --> 13:53.314
If the Prime Order marched on my
gates today, my army would fail.

13:53.364 --> 13:56.324
I would be hanged
for treason or worse.

13:56.364 --> 13:59.284
We desperately need more men
and the money to arm them,

13:59.324 --> 14:02.934
but nevertheless,

14:02.984 --> 14:04.504
I've made my decision.

14:07.024 --> 14:09.774
I am not desperate enough
to marry you.

14:11.424 --> 14:14.604
A drunkard, a lecher.

14:14.644 --> 14:19.214
A man who thinks
that the best way

14:19.254 --> 14:21.874
to ask for the Queen's hand
in marriage

14:21.914 --> 14:23.434
is to back her into a corner

14:23.484 --> 14:26.394
and taunt her
for lack of options.

14:26.434 --> 14:30.834
You are not deserving
of a place at my side.

14:30.874 --> 14:32.354
Do you think I'm bluffing?

14:32.404 --> 14:34.144
This isn't a game of Octor.

14:34.184 --> 14:37.274
If you do not accept my
proposal, I will take my men,

14:37.324 --> 14:39.754
I'll take my gold,
and I will leave.

14:39.804 --> 14:43.714
- I mean it.
- So do I.

14:43.764 --> 14:45.064
You have no honor.

14:45.114 --> 14:47.634
You care for nothing
but yourself.

14:47.674 --> 14:50.284
And I shall happily watch
from my unmanned battlements

14:50.334 --> 14:55.334
as you turn tail
and leave my Outpost for good.

14:57.554 --> 15:01.254
- You may go.
- You'll regret this.

15:01.304 --> 15:05.304
Perhaps, but I would regret
the other option far more.

15:11.134 --> 15:12.834
- That was...
- Idiotic?

15:12.874 --> 15:16.274
No. That was incredible.

15:16.314 --> 15:18.884
It's just that...

15:18.924 --> 15:21.754
what are you going
to do now, Majesty?

15:21.794 --> 15:23.250
The Prime Order army
could be days away.

15:23.274 --> 15:25.194
I have no idea.

15:53.174 --> 15:54.914
I got a couple
of questions for you.

15:54.964 --> 15:58.274
It would be a smart idea
if you answered them honestly.

15:58.314 --> 15:59.924
You seem like a smart geezer,

15:59.964 --> 16:02.314
so, uh, we don't have
a problem, do we?

16:04.274 --> 16:07.414
Now when I take my hand away,

16:07.454 --> 16:10.934
you scream,
I'll cut your bits off.

16:10.974 --> 16:14.194
You lie to me,
I'll cut your bits off.

16:14.244 --> 16:15.544
And if you run...

16:15.594 --> 16:18.594
You'll cut my bits off.

16:18.634 --> 16:21.514
Yeah. Smart man indeed.

16:26.424 --> 16:29.824
Is Garret Spears still alive?

16:29.864 --> 16:32.874
I don't know, I swear.

16:40.704 --> 16:42.013
Get that cape off.

17:28.703 --> 17:31.713
- Garret?
- Wythers? What...

17:31.753 --> 17:33.843
What are you doing here?

17:33.883 --> 17:35.753
I was going to break in
and save your ass.

17:37.453 --> 17:39.113
I thought you'd look
a right bloody mess.

17:39.153 --> 17:40.853
Oh, I did.
They fixed me up.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.943
- It's good to see you.
- Likewise.

17:42.983 --> 17:44.399
I can't believe
you came all this way.

17:44.423 --> 17:48.253
Garret, you're my only child.

17:48.293 --> 17:50.203
I thought you'd
all forgotten me.

17:50.253 --> 17:52.553
Don't be daft. Come on,
let's get you out of here.

17:52.603 --> 17:54.823
No, no.
I'm not going anywhere.

17:54.863 --> 17:56.433
This is my home now.

17:56.473 --> 17:58.123
What are you talking about, boy?

17:58.173 --> 18:00.263
The Outpost is rotten.

18:00.303 --> 18:03.483
A false queen, a Blackblood
intent on destroying the world.

18:03.523 --> 18:06.183
What would I be going back to?
A life of lies?

18:06.223 --> 18:08.093
Keep your voice down.
Have you gone mad?

18:08.133 --> 18:11.833
You're mad if you think
I'd go back knowing the truth.

18:11.883 --> 18:14.843
Those people want to commit
treason against The Holy Three.

18:16.883 --> 18:19.583
Enough of that.

18:19.623 --> 18:21.893
I'll drag you back to
the Outpost on my shoulder

18:21.933 --> 18:25.723
like a sack of spuds
if I have to.

18:25.763 --> 18:27.813
No.

18:31.203 --> 18:32.813
Guards!

18:35.163 --> 18:37.383
You'd call the guards
on your own father?

18:37.423 --> 18:38.823
It's for your own good.

18:38.863 --> 18:40.123
- Who is this?
- He's my father.

18:41.823 --> 18:43.603
And he's as blind as I once was.

18:43.653 --> 18:46.133
- Take him away.
- What have they done to you, boy?

18:46.173 --> 18:48.783
- Take him away!
- Huh?

18:48.833 --> 18:50.133
What have they done?

18:52.313 --> 18:54.493
You can fix him, can't you?

18:54.533 --> 18:56.103
As you fixed me?

18:56.143 --> 18:58.753
I will take care of him,
I promise you.

18:58.793 --> 19:00.403
Thank you.

19:05.323 --> 19:06.519
What? I'm a prisoner here
as well, then?

19:06.543 --> 19:08.333
You can leave come morning,

19:08.373 --> 19:09.983
and good riddance to you.

19:10.023 --> 19:11.853
I've been looking for you
everywhere.

19:11.893 --> 19:13.569
I wanted to go see Vikka,
but these two idiots...

19:13.593 --> 19:15.073
Are doing their job.

19:16.203 --> 19:18.123
Come on.

19:18.163 --> 19:21.083
Go back to that filthy...

19:21.123 --> 19:24.953
Save their queen
and this is how they act.

19:24.993 --> 19:27.083
Filthy.

19:27.133 --> 19:30.093
Seems not too much
has changed in this world.

19:32.653 --> 19:34.419
- Talon, I brought you medicine.
- Look, not now, Janzo.

19:34.443 --> 19:35.833
- Please.
- Blackbloods heal fast.

19:35.873 --> 19:38.143
She doesn't need
your medicine, human.

19:38.183 --> 19:40.313
Please.

19:40.363 --> 19:41.363
Thanks.

19:51.373 --> 19:53.853
Janzo!

19:53.893 --> 19:55.983
Gwynn needs more
of the ointment you gave me.

19:56.023 --> 19:58.073
Naya, hello.

19:58.113 --> 20:00.033
It's um... it's nice to see you.

20:01.513 --> 20:02.773
- Janzo?
- Hmm?

20:02.813 --> 20:04.643
Are you all right?

20:04.693 --> 20:08.783
- You're acting a bit odd.
- No, I'm not.

20:08.823 --> 20:10.523
- Am I making you nervous?
- No.

20:11.913 --> 20:13.393
No.

20:13.433 --> 20:15.313
Actually, if you must know,

20:15.353 --> 20:17.573
I've just been
a bit distracted lately.

20:17.613 --> 20:22.623
- What, by me?
- Amongst other things, yes.

20:22.663 --> 20:24.403
Really?

20:29.153 --> 20:30.283
Naya!

20:35.983 --> 20:38.503
What are you doing?

20:38.553 --> 20:41.723
I just saved your life.

20:41.773 --> 20:44.463
Thank you.

20:44.513 --> 20:45.579
Though now that
I think about it,

20:45.603 --> 20:46.903
you not being a colipsum user,

20:46.953 --> 20:48.693
your life wasn't
terribly in danger.

20:48.733 --> 20:50.253
I mean, just the...
The puncture wound

20:50.303 --> 20:51.953
of a parasitic Plagueling worm

20:51.993 --> 20:53.693
is quite unpleasant.

20:53.733 --> 20:55.743
It becomes a red mound
of swollen skin

20:55.783 --> 20:58.653
that secretes
a surprising amount of pus.

20:58.703 --> 21:00.239
Would have looked ghastly
on your beautiful neck.

21:00.263 --> 21:02.663
Janzo, will you...

21:02.703 --> 21:06.013
I mean, would you like
to meet me tomorrow?

21:06.053 --> 21:08.923
- Hmm?
- Take a walk in the gardens?

21:08.973 --> 21:11.323
The sun might
do us both some good.

21:11.363 --> 21:13.933
- The sun?
- Mm-hmm.

21:13.973 --> 21:15.543
The sun.

21:15.583 --> 21:18.803
Naya, you're a bloody genius.

21:20.333 --> 21:23.593
Why do Plaguelings
only come out at night, huh?

21:23.633 --> 21:25.593
I don't know.

21:25.643 --> 21:27.293
Well, I don't know either.

21:27.333 --> 21:29.863
But I'm gonna find out.

21:36.303 --> 21:37.743
I told you to stay here.

21:37.783 --> 21:39.353
Can you blame me?

21:39.393 --> 21:41.743
A century of confinement?
I wanted some fresh air.

21:47.013 --> 21:49.623
Gwynn commanded me to send you
and Vikka back through the portal.

21:54.193 --> 21:56.453
And I think she's right.

21:56.493 --> 21:57.583
No, you don't.

22:00.983 --> 22:02.593
People are afraid of you.

22:02.633 --> 22:04.309
People are always scared
of what they don't understand.

22:04.333 --> 22:07.983
Are you afraid?

22:08.033 --> 22:13.253
- I just don't trust you.
- That's wise.

22:13.293 --> 22:15.009
Well, I can't very well
gain your confidence

22:15.033 --> 22:17.783
if you send me back to the
darkness and dust, now can I?

22:20.343 --> 22:22.213
So the odd little man was right.

22:22.263 --> 22:24.613
You're still hurt.

22:24.653 --> 22:26.313
Let me see.

22:28.443 --> 22:30.613
It's fine.
Janzo will fix it.

22:30.663 --> 22:32.183
I want to help, Talon.

22:43.103 --> 22:46.063
Hmm. Broken bones.

22:46.113 --> 22:48.723
Take us longer to heal.

22:48.763 --> 22:50.243
Take off your shirt.

22:52.813 --> 22:55.123
It's purely medicinal.

23:04.913 --> 23:07.433
I meant what I said, Talon.

23:07.483 --> 23:09.313
I want to help.

23:11.263 --> 23:13.663
You want to help
your own people.

23:13.703 --> 23:16.313
No one else.

23:16.363 --> 23:18.443
You're just like Rebb.

23:18.493 --> 23:22.103
Rebb would sooner see this world
burn than share it with humans.

23:22.143 --> 23:23.973
My clan understands compromise,

23:24.023 --> 23:25.972
especially
if it means our freedom.

23:29.762 --> 23:31.412
Rebb said my ancestors
are the reason

23:31.462 --> 23:35.682
the Blackbloods are trapped
behind the portal,

23:35.722 --> 23:37.862
that my clan
tricked their own people.

23:37.902 --> 23:41.512
No, I believe your clan
was tricked, too, by humans.

23:43.512 --> 23:45.082
My people don't blame you.

23:45.122 --> 23:47.472
They understand the history
of the Blackbloods.

23:47.522 --> 23:50.002
Humans use us,
they take advantage of us,

23:50.042 --> 23:51.702
and they discard us.

23:58.832 --> 24:00.662
Gwynn wants you gone.

24:01.712 --> 24:03.662
She thinks you're dangerous.

24:05.232 --> 24:06.932
Are all humans dangerous?

24:06.972 --> 24:08.972
- Of course not.
- Blackbloods are no different.

24:09.022 --> 24:13.152
Your Queen doesn't seem
to understand that.

24:13.192 --> 24:16.552
But you, you want to
understand, don't you?

24:16.592 --> 24:20.512
You need to be
with your own people, Talon.

24:20.552 --> 24:22.032
And if you intend to be the One

24:22.072 --> 24:24.382
and control the Asterkinj,
you need me.

24:24.422 --> 24:26.772
I know the names
of every single Lu-Qiri.

24:26.822 --> 24:29.228
Just think, with me by your side,
we could bring back our people.

24:29.252 --> 24:32.652
If I let you stay, I'm disobeying
direct orders from the Queen.

24:32.692 --> 24:35.572
I won't tell if you won't.

24:37.572 --> 24:39.222
I mean, for all I know,
she's right.

24:40.532 --> 24:43.052
You could be dangerous.

24:43.092 --> 24:44.572
I could be.

24:46.532 --> 24:48.452
Talon, you have
so much to learn,

24:48.492 --> 24:51.622
and I'm the only one
who can teach you.

24:53.542 --> 24:55.372
Then stay here.

24:57.372 --> 24:59.422
All right, well,
no more wandering around.

24:59.462 --> 25:02.642
No one can find out
that I disobeyed the Queen.

25:02.682 --> 25:04.292
You've made the right decision.

25:04.332 --> 25:06.252
Then prove it.

25:21.522 --> 25:23.722
I've been told you have an
urgent need to speak with me.

25:30.272 --> 25:34.012
Yes, Your Majesty.
Uh, take a seat, would you?

25:34.062 --> 25:36.802
How kind of you to offer
me a seat on my own throne.

25:36.842 --> 25:39.168
But something tells me I ought
to remain standing at the moment.

25:39.192 --> 25:41.388
What is it that's brought you
here to see me this morning?

25:41.412 --> 25:46.072
I'll cut straight to it. You sent the
Baron packing with a good spanking,

25:46.112 --> 25:47.812
if the talk in the pub
is any measure.

25:47.852 --> 25:49.642
Yes, well,
he was not a good match.

25:49.682 --> 25:51.642
Except he had
everything you need.

25:51.682 --> 25:57.172
- Not everything.
- Your Majesty, uh,

25:57.212 --> 26:01.562
speaking as a woman whose had

26:01.612 --> 26:03.912
her fair share of men,

26:03.962 --> 26:05.352
I do understand that no one

26:05.392 --> 26:07.662
will ever measure up
to Garret Spears.

26:10.532 --> 26:13.752
I understand you sister
is Master Tobin's advisor.

26:13.792 --> 26:15.932
I assume you're here
on her behalf

26:15.972 --> 26:18.128
to implore me to accept
the Baron's proposal after all?

26:18.152 --> 26:22.022
Gods, no. Gertie and that Baron
can shove that proposal of theirs

26:22.062 --> 26:25.502
right up their tiny, little a...

26:25.542 --> 26:27.762
My apologies.

26:29.032 --> 26:30.592
Why are you here?

26:38.212 --> 26:41.732
I have a proposal of my own,
Your Majesty.

26:41.782 --> 26:44.562
I may not have an army,
but gold?

26:44.612 --> 26:46.352
Gold I have, and lots of it,

26:46.392 --> 26:48.182
and I'll be getting
a whole lot more.

26:48.222 --> 26:51.142
It will pay for
the reopening of the mines,

26:51.182 --> 26:55.572
fill the food stores,
and buy you time.

26:55.622 --> 26:57.712
And the good news is
you don't have to marry me,

26:57.752 --> 27:00.192
because, frankly,
you're not my type.

27:02.972 --> 27:05.218
You don't make this offer out
of the goodness of your heart.

27:05.242 --> 27:07.592
So what do you want?

27:07.632 --> 27:10.072
Simply to be made
Royal Advisor to the Queen.

27:11.592 --> 27:13.332
Hmm.

27:13.372 --> 27:15.072
Perhaps I should
sit down after all.

27:17.512 --> 27:19.992
I don't wish to know
how you came into such wealth.

27:20.032 --> 27:22.912
And although
your offer is generous,

27:22.952 --> 27:26.082
these funds, I fear,
come from questionable sources.

27:26.132 --> 27:30.092
- I'm a businesswoman.
- You're a criminal.

27:30.132 --> 27:34.662
Your Majesty,
you're about to go to war.

27:37.052 --> 27:39.922
You need a criminal.

27:39.972 --> 27:42.622
And I will advise you
from a perspective

27:42.672 --> 27:46.762
I wager you have
never dreamed of.

27:46.802 --> 27:49.722
And let's face it,
gold's gold at the end of the day.

27:49.762 --> 27:53.022
If I were to make you advisor,
then I would need assurance

27:53.072 --> 27:56.592
that you detach yourself from
these business endeavors.

27:56.642 --> 27:59.642
- I can make arrangements.
- And that you come and speak with me

27:59.682 --> 28:02.692
before you act on any other
opportunities that may come your way.

28:02.732 --> 28:07.782
If you make me Treasurer
of the Realm as well.

28:07.822 --> 28:09.652
Hmm.

28:14.262 --> 28:17.662
Madame, I accept your proposal.

28:17.702 --> 28:20.792
It sure beats marrying
that dolt.

28:20.832 --> 28:22.882
I thought you'd see it that way.

28:32.192 --> 28:33.452
And remember, Janzo!

28:33.502 --> 28:35.048
Janzo, just because
I put you in charge,

28:35.072 --> 28:36.462
it doesn't mean
you're in charge.

28:36.502 --> 28:37.892
- Do you hear me?
- Yes. Yes, Mum.

28:37.942 --> 28:40.422
I want very,
very detailed books.

28:40.462 --> 28:43.292
I want no drop of ale
unaccounted for,

28:43.332 --> 28:45.822
no crumb of brown bread, no...

28:45.862 --> 28:49.172
Mum, please stop.
Just tell me one thing.

28:49.212 --> 28:51.042
Why did Gwynn
appoint you Advisor?

28:51.082 --> 28:52.522
My attention to detail.

28:54.132 --> 28:55.652
You've got lipstick
on your teeth.

29:06.622 --> 29:09.842
Sister, hello!

29:09.882 --> 29:11.492
The Baron's not here. I know.

29:11.542 --> 29:12.842
I was surprised as you are,

29:12.892 --> 29:14.452
considering how much
he likes his...

29:17.502 --> 29:19.542
- You're in high spirits.
- I know!

29:19.592 --> 29:23.292
Janzo, come and tell your auntie
why I'm in such high spirits.

29:23.332 --> 29:25.722
The Queen made Mum
Royal Advisor.

29:25.772 --> 29:27.942
So tell me,
does a Queen outrank a Baron?

29:27.992 --> 29:31.692
I didn't get your education,
so I get a bit confused around that point.

29:37.342 --> 29:39.782
May your journey home
be as uneventful

29:39.832 --> 29:41.482
as the rest of your life.

30:04.372 --> 30:05.982
I don't care if it'll be dark.

30:06.032 --> 30:07.942
We'll light some torches
and we'll keep going.

30:07.982 --> 30:10.331
The sooner we're out
of this dump, the better.

30:10.381 --> 30:12.601
We're not going anywhere.

30:12.641 --> 30:13.601
Yes, we are.

30:13.641 --> 30:16.781
I say we are, so we are!

30:16.821 --> 30:19.341
Your temper was terrible
when you were a boy, Tobin,

30:19.391 --> 30:21.391
but be assured
it's less so with age.

30:21.431 --> 30:23.197
I want to get as far away
from this place as possible.

30:23.221 --> 30:25.831
I don't want to
be near that harpy.

30:25.871 --> 30:28.311
Hold your tongue, young man.

30:28.351 --> 30:32.101
And answer me this, is your vanity
more important than your legacy?

30:32.141 --> 30:34.621
The legacy that you deserve?

30:34.661 --> 30:37.271
Well, what can I do?
She's rejected me.

30:37.321 --> 30:40.711
If you had done things my way,
she would already be yours.

30:40.761 --> 30:41.971
I know how to seduce a woman.

30:42.021 --> 30:43.631
I've always been
quite successful.

30:43.671 --> 30:46.071
Yes, with your common strumpets.

30:46.111 --> 30:48.631
This is a queen.

30:48.681 --> 30:49.827
From now on, you will do things

30:49.851 --> 30:52.421
exactly as I tell you to.

30:52.461 --> 30:55.811
Do I make myself clear?

30:55.861 --> 30:59.211
Yes, my lady.

30:59.251 --> 31:02.431
By hook or by crook, Tobin,

31:02.471 --> 31:04.741
I will make you a king.

31:18.711 --> 31:20.621
- Barkeep.
- You're supposed to be gone.

31:20.671 --> 31:23.361
But I decided to stay,
so give me your finest ale.

31:23.411 --> 31:25.411
Janzo, you're not to serve
the Baron another drop.

31:25.451 --> 31:26.891
Do I make myself clear?

31:26.931 --> 31:28.371
- What?
- No more drink.

31:28.411 --> 31:30.761
The Baron will be taking
his rooms again.

31:49.911 --> 31:52.391
This can't be all there is.

31:53.831 --> 31:55.791
I got us some cheese.

32:00.441 --> 32:01.531
You better clean this up.

32:01.581 --> 32:04.671
It looks like
Janzo's lab in here.

32:04.711 --> 32:07.151
Sorry.
I guess I got a bit excited.

32:07.191 --> 32:10.191
But, look,
I found something amazing.

32:10.241 --> 32:12.151
I always thought
this was a myth.

32:12.201 --> 32:14.551
But your smith,
he had it right here.

32:17.371 --> 32:18.461
Have you seen this before?

32:28.951 --> 32:31.211
- What is this?
- The key.

32:31.261 --> 32:35.741
- What? A picture?
- No, a key.

32:35.781 --> 32:38.701
I was hoping your smith
might know where it is.

32:38.741 --> 32:40.181
He never spoke to me about it.

32:40.221 --> 32:42.271
I've never seen that before.

32:42.311 --> 32:44.311
What does it unlock?

32:44.361 --> 32:47.841
If the stories are true,
this key unlocks a great power

32:47.881 --> 32:51.801
that could solve the problems
of our people and your Queen.

32:51.841 --> 32:54.281
Well, in my experience,
powers just create more problems.

32:54.321 --> 32:57.021
Talon, I have this new
theory about the Plaguelings,

32:57.071 --> 33:00.331
- but first I need...
- Oh, come on.

33:00.371 --> 33:02.111
You're supposed to be gone.

33:02.161 --> 33:03.991
- Janzo.
- What's he doing here?

33:04.031 --> 33:05.641
Didn't Gwynn tell you
to send him away?

33:05.681 --> 33:08.641
Talon didn't want to see me go.

33:08.691 --> 33:11.121
He's helping me.

33:11.171 --> 33:13.691
No. No, I'm sorry,
but I help you,

33:13.731 --> 33:15.391
and I'm very good at it.

33:15.431 --> 33:17.481
What can he help you with
that I can't, hmm?

33:17.521 --> 33:20.131
Understanding who I am.

33:21.531 --> 33:24.961
What I'm meant to do.

33:25.011 --> 33:27.027
Well, Gwynn's not going to be
very happy about this, is she?

33:27.051 --> 33:29.581
Yes, and I'll tell
Gwynn when I'm ready.

33:29.621 --> 33:33.061
But until then...

33:34.361 --> 33:36.021
can you keep a secret?

33:36.061 --> 33:40.501
Talon, this is
manipulative and unfair.

33:40.541 --> 33:43.241
Yes.

33:53.041 --> 33:56.081
Shut up!

33:56.131 --> 33:58.741
I waited in the garden for you.

33:58.781 --> 34:01.351
Oh, I forgot.
I've just got so much on my mind.

34:01.391 --> 34:03.781
- You stood me up.
- I'm sorry, all right?

34:03.831 --> 34:05.001
I was on my way, and then...

34:05.051 --> 34:07.311
And then I got sidetracked by...

34:07.351 --> 34:09.231
- By what?
- Well, I actually can't tell you

34:09.271 --> 34:11.051
because I made a promise.

34:11.101 --> 34:13.661
Suffice to say,

34:13.710 --> 34:16.281
I'm sorry and I forgot,
all right?

34:24.681 --> 34:30.331
I don't understand why I will forever
be seen by women as just a friend.

34:30.380 --> 34:32.601
A boring, trustworthy friend

34:32.641 --> 34:35.771
that they can just pile all of
their secrets onto, you know?

34:35.821 --> 34:37.471
Do you know that
I've only ever kissed

34:37.511 --> 34:40.471
two women in my entire life?

34:40.521 --> 34:42.481
Talon because
she thought I was dying,

34:42.521 --> 34:46.781
and you...
It wasn't even real, was it?

34:46.831 --> 34:49.571
Did it feel like it wasn't real?

34:51.880 --> 34:54.621
Well, no.
No, of course not,

34:54.661 --> 34:56.581
but you were just trying
to fix me, weren't you?

34:56.621 --> 35:00.281
You don't need fixing, Janzo.

35:00.321 --> 35:03.281
Well, that's good news
for you then, isn't it?

35:03.321 --> 35:05.461
Because ever since
you started meddling, Naya,

35:05.501 --> 35:09.981
I'm more... more Janzo than ever.

35:10.031 --> 35:13.721
Not all women care about
muscles and all that stuff.

35:13.771 --> 35:17.341
They want someone
sweet and kind.

35:17.381 --> 35:22.951
A man who is caring,
funny, brilliant.

35:22.991 --> 35:25.341
That's what most women want.

35:29.001 --> 35:31.741
Do you know any men like that?

35:31.791 --> 35:33.311
Mm-hmm.

35:33.351 --> 35:34.791
Mm-hmm?

35:43.151 --> 35:45.971
I'm honored to bow
before The Three,

35:46.021 --> 35:48.541
and I pledge my heart
and my blood.

35:48.591 --> 35:51.591
Rise.

35:51.631 --> 35:54.421
When your commander
bowed before us,

35:54.461 --> 35:58.331
we were pleased
with your progress.

35:58.381 --> 36:00.951
But one concern remains.

36:00.991 --> 36:02.341
That it was not to The Three

36:02.381 --> 36:04.341
he pledged his heart and blood.

36:04.381 --> 36:05.521
But to you.

36:05.561 --> 36:06.991
That was the first part

36:07.041 --> 36:09.171
of the positive conditioning.

36:09.211 --> 36:10.651
But we now have confirmation

36:10.691 --> 36:12.391
that our conditioning
of Garret Spears

36:12.441 --> 36:14.051
has gone to the next level.

36:14.091 --> 36:16.401
And you know this how?

36:16.441 --> 36:20.881
He passed one last test.
He rejected his own family.

36:20.921 --> 36:23.451
We are convinced my Three,

36:23.491 --> 36:26.751
Garret Spears is ready
for his purpose.

36:26.801 --> 36:28.931
Then send him before us.

36:28.971 --> 36:30.411
Alone.

36:39.291 --> 36:40.851
The miners agreed
to these terms?

36:40.901 --> 36:43.341
Mm-hmm. I let them have
a few wins first,

36:43.381 --> 36:45.641
just so everyone felt
a bit warm and fuzzy.

36:46.861 --> 36:48.691
Thank you.

36:48.731 --> 36:53.610
Our mining operation
is officially reopened,

36:53.650 --> 36:55.650
thanks to you.

36:56.870 --> 36:58.660
I will get them cracking then.

37:05.710 --> 37:07.230
Do you have a moment,
Your Majesty?

37:07.270 --> 37:10.450
I'm afraid Her Majesty
has run out of moments.

37:10.490 --> 37:12.840
Off you go, or I'll have you
sent out a window.

37:12.890 --> 37:14.800
Now that's no way to talk
to a Baron, Elinor.

37:14.850 --> 37:16.800
Besides, I just had
that window repaired.

37:16.850 --> 37:20.070
It's all right, Elinor.
Thank you.

37:20.110 --> 37:23.030
I think I'll stay, Your Majesty.

37:26.810 --> 37:28.990
I've come to apologize,
Your Majesty,

37:29.030 --> 37:32.250
for the way I behaved.

37:32.300 --> 37:35.260
- You have?
- Yes, I was greedy,

37:35.300 --> 37:38.090
and I thought
you might be greedy, too.

37:38.130 --> 37:41.480
I saw what you needed,
and I used it to force your hand.

37:43.350 --> 37:45.350
That is very big of you
to admit, Baron,

37:45.400 --> 37:47.570
but my mind is already made up.

37:47.620 --> 37:49.620
An apology won't convince me
to marry you.

37:49.660 --> 37:52.880
The road to your home is long.
You should go.

37:52.930 --> 37:55.710
Before you hit the road,
why don't you have a drink?

37:55.760 --> 37:57.760
It's on me.

37:57.800 --> 38:01.410
Begging your pardon, Majesty,
but I'm not going anywhere.

38:01.460 --> 38:02.590
And neither are my men.

38:06.330 --> 38:07.990
Your men.

38:08.030 --> 38:11.120
They are yours
to command, as am I.

38:11.160 --> 38:12.730
It would be an honor
to serve a queen

38:12.770 --> 38:14.600
as passionate
and honorable as yourself.

38:14.640 --> 38:18.820
You flatter me, but why are you doing this?
What's the catch?

38:18.870 --> 38:20.950
I told you,
I wanted to secure my legacy.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.830
Yes, to be the father of kings,
which is off the table.

38:23.870 --> 38:27.440
Yes, it is, but without
that, what is my legacy?

38:27.480 --> 38:29.180
Drunken brawls?

38:29.220 --> 38:30.310
Gambling? Whoring?

38:30.360 --> 38:32.140
Ahem.

38:34.710 --> 38:37.970
This, serving you.

38:38.020 --> 38:39.580
Helping you retake the Realm,

38:39.630 --> 38:41.150
that will be my legacy.

38:41.190 --> 38:43.630
It's time I started
doing the right things

38:43.670 --> 38:46.070
for the right reasons.

38:59.690 --> 39:01.130
Wakey, wakey.

39:03.300 --> 39:05.350
Oh, you look like bloody hell.

39:05.390 --> 39:08.350
You're about to look
a lot worse.

39:17.100 --> 39:19.190
Your son asked me
to look after you.

39:19.230 --> 39:21.710
That's a shame.

39:21.750 --> 39:24.540
I'm not so eager
to be in your care.

39:24.580 --> 39:28.110
Well, you will be when the
Tormentor here is finished with you.

39:54.920 --> 39:57.830
I am honored to bow
before The Three.

39:57.880 --> 39:59.880
I pledge my heart and blood.

40:01.660 --> 40:02.670
Rise.

40:05.970 --> 40:09.240
The Three has a purpose
for you, Commander,

40:09.280 --> 40:10.370
if you are ready.

40:10.410 --> 40:12.850
I am, my Three.

40:18.420 --> 40:20.070
Son!

40:21.900 --> 40:25.730
Commander Spears,
kill your father.

40:40.920 --> 40:42.100
Garret.

41:24.140 --> 41:26.710
From this day forward,

41:26.750 --> 41:30.450
you will no longer answer
to the name Garret Spears.

41:30.490 --> 41:33.840
You are now
The Blade of The Three.

41:33.890 --> 41:36.890
Are you ready for your purpose,
Blade of The Three?

41:38.540 --> 41:39.590
With all my heart.

41:39.630 --> 41:42.770
You will return to the Outpost.

41:42.810 --> 41:44.900
You will kill the Blackblood.

41:44.940 --> 41:47.810
You will kidnap the false queen.

41:47.860 --> 41:51.340
My purpose is clear.

41:51.380 --> 41:53.040
I will fulfill it with honor.

41:55.520 --> 41:57.300
Hail to The Three.
