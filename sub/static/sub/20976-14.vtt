00:06.367 --> 00:07.767
- My boobs are messed up,

00:07.767 --> 00:10.166
and my tummy tuck looks
like the Joker's mouth.

00:10.166 --> 00:12.000
both: Oh!

00:12.000 --> 00:14.400
- That--I gotta tell you
that makes me nauseated.

00:14.400 --> 00:16.166
- Yeah.
Krystle's last surgery

00:16.166 --> 00:19.133
could have literally been
her last surgery.

00:19.133 --> 00:20.533
- I didn't find out till after
my surgery that he had

00:20.533 --> 00:22.300
since had a stroke,

00:22.300 --> 00:24.300
and he stopped
practicing for years.

00:24.300 --> 00:27.433
- We've never heard a story
of a doctor that had a stroke,

00:27.433 --> 00:29.266
still had residual effects,
and then came back

00:29.266 --> 00:30.300
and operated on a patient.

00:30.300 --> 00:31.433
- It became a party trick.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.533
- And if I go sideways...
both: Oh!

00:35.533 --> 00:38.066
- We need to find
usable cartilage and quick.

00:38.066 --> 00:39.600
'Cause we need a lot of rim.

00:39.600 --> 00:43.533
- I carry every ounce of fat
on my body in my butt.

00:43.533 --> 00:47.333
- Stand up and let's look
at the area.

00:47.333 --> 00:49.066
Okay.
- Damn!

00:49.066 --> 00:50.333

I am 33 years old,

01:06.433 --> 01:11.333
and I carry every ounce of fat
on my body in my butt.

01:11.333 --> 01:13.166
I'm from Detroit, Michigan.

01:13.166 --> 01:15.467
Detroit is a poverty city.

01:15.467 --> 01:18.600
There's really no jobs
or anything, so outside of,

01:18.600 --> 01:20.633
if you're not a doctor
or a lawyer

01:20.633 --> 01:22.500
or a stripper or a dope dealer,

01:22.500 --> 01:27.200
you're a plant worker,
so you choose your poison.

01:27.200 --> 01:29.367
When I first started working
at the steel mill,

01:29.367 --> 01:31.633
it was amazeballs.

01:31.633 --> 01:35.367
I was a ladle pour, like,
up on the hot molten steel.

01:35.367 --> 01:38.567
We have to wear sleeves
that comes up to here,

01:38.567 --> 01:42.333
a wool jacket,
aluminized jacket, face shield,

01:42.333 --> 01:45.600
your hard hat,
on the top of 140 degrees.

01:45.600 --> 01:48.467
You're doing a lot of heavy,
physical work.

01:48.467 --> 01:51.066
Where's my sexy?

01:51.066 --> 01:54.200
Being the only female there
to do what I did--

01:54.200 --> 01:56.633
that's where Supa Woman
initially started.

01:56.633 --> 02:00.233
It brought me up
to transforming myself

02:00.233 --> 02:02.667
into this superhero-type person,

02:02.667 --> 02:05.367
but I weighed 310 pounds.

02:05.367 --> 02:08.233
You know, I worked out,
lost some weight, saved up,

02:08.233 --> 02:11.266
and decided I wanted to have
some liposuction to kind of,

02:11.266 --> 02:14.533
you know, boost my sexiness
going out a little faster,

02:14.533 --> 02:16.667
so the doctor, he said,
"Hey, you know,

02:16.667 --> 02:19.633
"you can use
this fat to go into places

02:19.633 --> 02:21.667
where you want possibly
a little bigger."

02:21.667 --> 02:25.400
So I was like, "Oh,
this could be kind of cool."

02:25.400 --> 02:28.233
At the time, Nicki Minaj
was just coming out,

02:28.233 --> 02:31.233
and her body was, like, boom,
bang, pow, and I was like,

02:31.233 --> 02:34.133
"Yeah, Nicky, yes!
I want to be like you."

02:34.133 --> 02:37.233
From there, I decided
that I wanted to use my fat

02:37.233 --> 02:39.533
and not throw it away
and put it in my behind.

02:41.400 --> 02:43.433
1,200 CCs of fat
was injected into my butt

02:43.433 --> 02:45.166
my first surgery.

02:45.166 --> 02:47.266
My second,
it was about 900 CCs.

02:47.266 --> 02:49.667
When someone reached out
to me about modeling,

02:49.667 --> 02:51.500
I was taken back a little bit,

02:51.500 --> 02:53.433
'cause I'm like, "Me?"

02:53.433 --> 02:57.400
Like, "You sure you want me
to be in the magazine?"

02:57.400 --> 03:01.266
I went ahead and done it,
and from there, it just kind of,

03:01.266 --> 03:04.433
like--when people start
to see the pictures

03:04.433 --> 03:06.567
I got the opportunity
to start DJing.

03:06.567 --> 03:08.300
They pay me to DJ a set,

03:08.300 --> 03:10.400
and the rest of my night
is mingle and, you know,

03:10.400 --> 03:12.400
just spread happiness.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.300
I'm cool with that.

03:14.300 --> 03:18.166
Patty is that quiet,
dirty-faced steel worker,

03:18.166 --> 03:20.567
and Supa Woman is the complete
opposite of that.

03:20.567 --> 03:23.166
Supa Woman,
she stops traffic, baby.

03:23.166 --> 03:25.033
But I'm unhappy

03:25.033 --> 03:27.333
with the shape of my butt.

03:27.333 --> 03:29.600
Like, it has a flat surface,
and I hate it.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.600
You know how us females are.

03:31.600 --> 03:34.300
This strand of hair is not
doing what I want it to do,

03:34.300 --> 03:36.467
and just that one strand
of hair out of place,

03:36.467 --> 03:38.033
it make you feel ugly,

03:38.033 --> 03:39.333
so if I can get that fixed,

03:39.333 --> 03:40.700
it definitely would give me

03:40.700 --> 03:43.467
the boost to DJ
the biggest party.

03:43.467 --> 03:46.700
We gonna see Supa Woman
on TV screens.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.300
I'm gonna go far.

- My name is Michael,
I'm 32 years old,

03:52.467 --> 03:53.734
I'm from Nashville, Tennessee.

03:53.734 --> 03:57.567
My nose is a real flatliner.

03:57.567 --> 04:00.200
My dad was in the military,

04:00.200 --> 04:02.433
so I moved from school
to school, state to state,

04:02.433 --> 04:04.734
country to country, and I was
always really outgoing.

04:04.734 --> 04:06.734
I would be the first person,

04:06.734 --> 04:10.233
when I moved into a new house,
to go and meet new people.

04:10.233 --> 04:12.066
When I was four years old,
one day I was running around

04:12.066 --> 04:14.367
the house
and smacked my head facedown

04:14.367 --> 04:16.367
on a bed frame
about right here.

04:16.367 --> 04:19.467
It bled a lot, of course.
However, it wasn't bad enough

04:19.467 --> 04:21.333
to get it checked out.

04:21.333 --> 04:23.734
Over the years, my nose
started to heal crooked

04:23.734 --> 04:26.233
and high school was tough.
I got teased a lot.

04:26.233 --> 04:29.500
And if you're not
the cool kid or, you know,

04:29.500 --> 04:31.734
if you don't look,
you know, a certain way,

04:31.734 --> 04:34.233
it can be really,
you know, tough.

04:34.233 --> 04:36.200
I was no longer
that outgoing kid.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.367
So, in high school,
during my senior year,

04:38.367 --> 04:39.633
I finally just went ahead

04:39.633 --> 04:41.767
and saw the ENT
of our small town.

04:41.767 --> 04:44.500
Next thing I know, we go in,
I come out.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.367
Don't really even remember
the surgery at all.

04:46.367 --> 04:48.500
I just remember my nose
being twice as big.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.500
It was a hard healing process.

04:50.500 --> 04:52.367
My nose would not stop leak.

04:52.367 --> 04:54.367
They put a maxi pad
right here to soak it all up.

04:54.367 --> 04:57.367
So I never been to a prom.
I decided to stay home.

04:57.367 --> 04:59.533
There was no way that I was
going to go to a prom

04:59.533 --> 05:03.400
with a maxi pad
on my face, pretty much.

05:03.400 --> 05:07.367
That swelling of my nose
never quite went away,

05:07.367 --> 05:09.533
and more importantly,

05:09.533 --> 05:12.367
I started noticing that
the whole tip

05:12.367 --> 05:14.734
of my nose was missing.
I joined a fraternity.

05:14.734 --> 05:16.400
They used to call me
"snake face,"

05:16.400 --> 05:18.000
"Voldemort," you name it.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.633
Anything to do
with a missing nose.

05:21.533 --> 05:24.266
It wasn't until I met
my girlfriend four years ago

05:24.266 --> 05:25.633
that it became
a real conversation piece.

05:25.633 --> 05:27.633
- Yeah.

05:27.633 --> 05:30.533
- Everybody look!
- As of right now,

05:30.533 --> 05:33.700
I can completely press
my nose into my face.

05:33.700 --> 05:36.033
I can move it
completely to the right.

05:36.033 --> 05:38.300
I can move it
completely to the left.

05:38.300 --> 05:39.433
- I know you hate
going to the doctor.

05:39.433 --> 05:41.400
- It's been 15 years.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.533

to look forward to, you know?

05:43.533 --> 05:45.433
I do love the way he is now,

05:45.433 --> 05:47.633
so it's not like I want him
to be a different person,

05:47.633 --> 05:50.033
but at the same time,
I know that he's gonna feel

05:50.033 --> 05:51.667
so much better
at the end of the day.

05:51.667 --> 05:53.667
He's totally gonna look
like Tom Brady.

05:53.667 --> 05:55.567
- I'm glad you're here with me.
- I'm gonna be your nurse.

05:55.567 --> 05:57.133

He was a young kid,
broke his nose,

- That is a good one.
- I've never seen that before.

06:52.433 --> 06:54.734
- That means there's, like...
both: No septum.

06:54.734 --> 06:56.633
- I'm surprised
it hasn't collapsed completely.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.767
- There are numerous reasons
why a septum can collapse.

06:58.767 --> 07:01.367
Number one, you're a boxer,
you get traumatized

07:01.367 --> 07:03.433
in the nose a lot.
Blood goes inside the septum,

07:03.433 --> 07:05.100
and then that erodes
all the cartilage.

07:05.100 --> 07:07.767
Two, previous surgery.
Three, cocaine.

07:07.767 --> 07:11.100

07:22.600 --> 07:24.500
- Can you start
in the beginning with us?

07:24.500 --> 07:27.467
- About three years of age,
I'd smacked my nose right here--

07:27.467 --> 07:28.767
caught the bridge of it,
on a bed.

07:28.767 --> 07:30.100
The actual bed frame.
- Yeah.

07:30.100 --> 07:31.467
- Yeah.
- Okay.

07:31.467 --> 07:33.033
- Wasn't soft.
And it cracked it.

07:33.033 --> 07:36.000
After about 15 years
of it just crooked--

07:36.000 --> 07:37.767
before I moved off to college,
I decided to get it fixed.

07:37.767 --> 07:39.533
Then it became a party trick.

07:39.533 --> 07:41.400
- Okay.

07:41.400 --> 07:42.767
I'll do it first right here.
It goes completely flat,

07:42.767 --> 07:44.533
and then if I go sideways...

07:44.533 --> 07:46.400
- I've seen noses
like this before.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.400
It's called a
saddle nose deformity,

07:48.400 --> 07:51.367
which is collapse of this part
of the nasal dorsum right here.

07:51.367 --> 07:53.066
Now,
how does this affect you?

07:53.066 --> 07:54.767
- To me, he's perfect
on the inside,

07:54.767 --> 07:57.533
and I want that
to match his outside.

07:57.533 --> 07:59.734
When I first saw him,
I remember thinking,

07:59.734 --> 08:01.633
"Man, that guy is so cute,"

08:01.633 --> 08:04.533
but I noticed something
was going on with his nose,

08:04.533 --> 08:07.400
so to find out that he had
actually had a surgery already,

08:07.400 --> 08:09.767
I was like,
"Oh, so you broke it

08:09.767 --> 08:12.400
and then had surgery and it
still looks kind of funky?"

08:12.400 --> 08:14.633
Like, "Maybe we should
get that checked out."

08:14.633 --> 08:17.000
But I didn't want to say
anything until, you know,

08:17.000 --> 08:18.533
I knew him a little better.

08:18.533 --> 08:20.433
We've been together
going on five years now,

08:20.433 --> 08:23.000
and we're moving into, you know,
that next stage in life,

08:23.000 --> 08:25.700
and--well, I'm hoping, so--
it's on my vision board.

08:25.700 --> 08:27.533
You know, a little ring.
- Oh!

08:27.533 --> 08:29.567
Yeah, I noticed that
she was like this.

08:29.567 --> 08:31.700
- You know.
- There's nothing...

08:33.166 --> 08:35.133
- And to--my family,
like, poke fun at him

08:35.133 --> 08:36.533
a little bit, so I know--
- It almost sounds like you do

08:36.533 --> 08:38.033
a little bit, too,
I have a feeling.

08:38.033 --> 08:39.567
- I definitely point it out,
and he gets

08:39.567 --> 08:41.667
pretty frustrated with me.

08:41.667 --> 08:43.166
- It's his parlor trick.

08:43.166 --> 08:44.700
- "Look at how wide
and fat it is.

08:44.700 --> 08:46.433
Go ahead and push it."

08:46.433 --> 08:48.166
- Yes, exactly.
It's cute the first time.

08:48.166 --> 08:49.400
- He was imitating his ex-wife,
just so you know.

08:49.400 --> 08:52.700
- Oh.

08:52.700 --> 08:55.433
- So, really,
you do that to him?

08:55.433 --> 08:57.166
- I do.
- Well, that's not that cool.

08:57.166 --> 08:59.133
- Yeah, it's not
the coolest of me.

08:59.133 --> 09:01.066
- Thank you. Thank you.
- I know.

09:01.066 --> 09:03.600
- Thank you, Kristen, for
reminding me of why I'm single.

09:03.600 --> 09:08.200
- My biggest concern is he
started having this yellow fluid

09:08.200 --> 09:11.066
come out of his nose.
And I started researching it,

09:11.066 --> 09:13.033
and to me, it sounded like
it's brain fluid,

09:13.033 --> 09:15.467
and for me,
that's a major concern.

09:15.467 --> 09:17.734
- Yeah, brain fluid coming out
of the nose in general

09:17.734 --> 09:19.467
is a major concern.

09:19.467 --> 09:21.300
- One night, he was just
sitting there,

09:21.300 --> 09:24.166
and fluid was just dripping
from his nose, like, badly.

09:24.166 --> 09:26.300
And I was like, "That's, like,
a yellowish color."

09:26.300 --> 09:28.600
It didn't look like
anything normal

09:28.600 --> 09:30.467
that I've ever seen
come out of a nose.

09:30.467 --> 09:31.734
And that really scared me.

09:31.734 --> 09:34.033
- It wasn't
the consistency of mucus,

09:34.033 --> 09:35.300
it was like a liquid,
clear yellow.

09:37.033 --> 09:38.600
- It was more clear
with a yellow hue.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.200
- Fascinating.
- Let's go to the exam room...

09:40.200 --> 09:42.100
- Okay.
- And let's go take a peek.

09:42.100 --> 09:44.100
- The reason we're so interested
as to whether Michael

09:44.100 --> 09:46.467
has brain fluid
leaking out of his nose

09:46.467 --> 09:49.500
is because the nose
has a lot of bacteria.

09:49.500 --> 09:52.066
If that brain fluid
gets infected,

09:52.066 --> 09:55.600
it can cause meningitis,
which is a brain infection.

09:55.600 --> 09:59.233
And that can cause sudden death.

Not good. Short cuffs.

10:32.600 --> 10:34.767
- Yeah.
- Keep breathing slowly.

10:34.767 --> 10:37.533
.

10:37.533 --> 10:39.200
You have little mucus bands
in there.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.200
That can also be the sign
of that drip you had.

10:41.200 --> 10:44.133
- I'm really hoping
that this yellow fluid

10:44.133 --> 10:46.667
is not actually brain fluid
because I know that

10:46.667 --> 10:48.533
some people
even have to have brain surgery,

10:48.533 --> 10:51.000
so I'm just hoping
that's really not the case.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.233
- We're gonna make this
painless for you.

10:53.233 --> 10:55.000
You've got a good amount
of allergies.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.200
That most likely
has been the cause

10:57.200 --> 10:59.100
of that yellowish fluid.

10:59.100 --> 11:02.000
Especially right now.
Sit, drop your head,

11:02.000 --> 11:03.266
and while I'm talking to you,
friend, I just want you

11:03.266 --> 11:05.367
to stay like that
for a second.

11:05.367 --> 11:07.767
Since Michael's nasal trauma
happened 28 years ago,

11:07.767 --> 11:11.100
a brain fluid leak would have
surfaced a long time ago.

11:11.100 --> 11:14.233
All right, so you did this
for a couple minutes, and...

11:14.233 --> 11:17.033
- Nothing.
- So we don't really think

11:17.033 --> 11:18.700
you have a CSF leak.
That's what we call it.

11:18.700 --> 11:21.100
Cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea.

11:21.100 --> 11:23.166
- And that's what I was afraid
of, so it's good to know.

11:23.166 --> 11:25.633
- I'm confident that
his one-time rhinorrhea

11:25.633 --> 11:27.700
was due to allergies,
and at this point,

11:27.700 --> 11:29.266
there's no reason
for a CT scan.

11:29.266 --> 11:30.767
So here's what we have to do.

11:30.767 --> 11:32.033
We have to make
a little incision right here,

11:32.033 --> 11:33.300
do an open rhinoplasty.

11:33.300 --> 11:35.033
We're gonna have
to make you a graft

11:35.033 --> 11:37.100
where you have enough
support right in the bottom

11:37.100 --> 11:39.100
and the top part here.
We're gonna use tissue

11:39.100 --> 11:40.667
from Michael's body
to make a nice implant,

11:40.667 --> 11:42.667
we're gonna put it
on his dorsum.

11:42.667 --> 11:45.066
It gives him more projection,
it helps lengthen the nose.

11:45.066 --> 11:47.600
Perfect.
So with what I just told you,

11:47.600 --> 11:49.066
what are your thoughts?

11:49.066 --> 11:50.667
- I'm really excited
to cosmetically

11:50.667 --> 11:52.300
look more appealing.

11:52.300 --> 11:55.133
- Yes, absolutely.
- I'm ready. I'm ready.

11:55.133 --> 11:57.600
As long as you--
I still love you as you are.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.166
- She's afraid I'm gonna
turn out looking different.

11:59.166 --> 12:01.066
- I fell in love with this.

12:01.066 --> 12:03.133
- Okay, but, now,
you're contradicting yourself.

12:03.133 --> 12:05.000
- I know.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.600
- I don't want him
to be different, even though

12:06.600 --> 12:08.066
I make fun of his
nose all the time and it's flat.

12:08.066 --> 12:09.266
- I know. I know.
- Welcome to marriage.

12:09.266 --> 12:11.066
- I know.
- Whoa. Whoa.

12:11.066 --> 12:12.300
- He's not married yet.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.734
- My name is Krystle,
I am 29 years old,

12:16.734 --> 12:18.667
and I got  surgery.
I'm botched.

12:18.667 --> 12:20.333
My boobs are messed up,

12:20.333 --> 12:23.300
and my tummy tuck looks
like the Joker's mouth.

12:23.300 --> 12:25.600
Growing up, I've always been
a huge girly girl.

12:25.600 --> 12:28.300
The fake nails
and the fake eyelashes.

12:28.300 --> 12:30.700
I believe I am obsessed
with my appearance.

12:30.700 --> 12:32.633
Girls should want
to get up every day

12:32.633 --> 12:34.367
and look good about yourself
and feel good about yourself.

12:34.367 --> 12:36.600
You know,
I always would tell people,

12:36.600 --> 12:38.600
"Oh, I can't wear this shirt,
because I look like a boy,

12:38.600 --> 12:40.300
because I don't have big boobs,"
and people would be like,

12:40.300 --> 12:42.200
"You're crazy.
You don't look like a boy.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.300
Boys don't wear makeup
and nails and all this."

12:44.300 --> 12:47.233
But it was just something,
you know, that I felt inside.

12:47.233 --> 12:49.066
I had my son when I was 15.

12:49.066 --> 12:51.367
My body was not prepared
at all for a baby,

12:51.367 --> 12:54.166
so my skin just
stretched dramatically.

12:54.166 --> 12:57.100
No matter how much I would try
and eat right or exercise,

12:57.100 --> 12:59.200
I just always had
that pouchy look.

12:59.200 --> 13:01.100
You know, I was very young,

13:01.100 --> 13:03.633
so I could never experience
a normal girl's,

13:03.633 --> 13:05.166
you know, wearing bikinis,
going with her friends,

13:05.166 --> 13:07.033
hanging out,
because my stretch marks

13:07.033 --> 13:10.467
were very noticeable.
That was my biggest issue.

13:10.467 --> 13:13.066
And then, recently,
a lady that I knew said,

13:13.066 --> 13:14.400
"I have this amazing doctor."

13:14.400 --> 13:17.266
I went to a consultation,
and he told me,

13:17.266 --> 13:19.667
"I'm gonna make you
look perfect."

13:19.667 --> 13:22.100
So he explained that he would
insert breast implants

13:22.100 --> 13:24.734
through my abdomen
while he's doing my tummy tuck.

13:24.734 --> 13:27.000
The surgery was gonna
cost $12,000.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.266
I told him I didn't have it,
so he told me,

13:29.266 --> 13:32.400
"Okay, I'm gonna help you out.
Go ahead and give me the $7,000,

13:32.400 --> 13:34.400
and you can pay me
the rest in payments."

13:34.400 --> 13:35.667
He had me at "payments."

13:35.667 --> 13:37.400
So the day of my surgery,

13:37.400 --> 13:40.400
I try and tell the nurse,
"I'm in pain, my IV hurts."

13:40.400 --> 13:42.467
And that's when she tells me,

13:42.467 --> 13:44.367
"This is nothing compared to
the pain you're about to feel."

13:44.367 --> 13:47.133
After surgery,
I was in a ton of pain.

13:47.133 --> 13:49.133
You know, from here down
to my feet,

13:49.133 --> 13:51.300
I was wrapped in bandages,
and then I was leaking,

13:51.300 --> 13:53.033
so there was blood
all over the bed.

13:53.033 --> 13:55.233
Right after she unwrapped me,

13:55.233 --> 13:58.166
my boobs did not
look similar at all.

13:58.166 --> 14:00.667
You know,
one was totally higher,

14:00.667 --> 14:02.700
one was, you know,
facing the other way.

14:02.700 --> 14:05.033
It was crazy.
I still can't see my stomach,

14:05.033 --> 14:07.367
and I really want to know, you
know, before they wrap me again,

14:07.367 --> 14:09.166
so I tell them,
"Take a picture of me.

14:09.166 --> 14:10.700
I want to see my stomach."

14:10.700 --> 14:12.300
Immediately, I was in tears.

14:12.300 --> 14:14.433
My scar was disgusting.

14:14.433 --> 14:16.767
It had some type
of gangrene on it,

14:16.767 --> 14:18.367
and I'm crying.
I'm in tears.

14:18.367 --> 14:21.367
A week and a half later,
the pain was unbearable.

14:21.367 --> 14:23.400
It was--I couldn't take it.
I go to the hospital,

14:23.400 --> 14:26.000
and they admit me
within five minutes.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
A general doctor went to see me,
and he was in shock.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.700
You know, he looked at me,
and he was like,

14:30.700 --> 14:32.166
"I don't know why you did
this to yourself.

14:32.166 --> 14:34.033
You're so lucky to be alive."

17:13.300 --> 17:15.767
- That--I got to tell you,
that makes me nauseated.

17:15.767 --> 17:17.033
- Yeah.

17:17.033 --> 17:18.166
- Yeah, bring her in.

17:18.166 --> 17:20.333
- Can you please
send in Krystle?

17:20.333 --> 17:22.200
- Krystle.
- Hello.

17:22.200 --> 17:23.600
- Nice to meet you. Dr. Nassif.
- Nice to meet you.

17:23.600 --> 17:26.600
I am nervous
because I don't know

17:26.600 --> 17:29.266
what my case is

17:29.266 --> 17:32.266
- So you went with the idea
of having your breasts done

17:32.266 --> 17:35.066
and a tummy tuck
for stretch marks primarily.

17:35.066 --> 17:36.400
- Yes. He told me,
"Oh, no,

17:36.400 --> 17:38.333
I'll take
all of your stretch marks off."

17:38.333 --> 17:40.066
- But what did you want
to have done with your breasts?

17:40.066 --> 17:41.333
- Well, I had tubular breasts.

17:41.333 --> 17:43.467
- Okay.
Tubular breasts are when

17:43.467 --> 17:46.734
the base of the breast
is very narrow,

17:46.734 --> 17:49.333
so it's like a tube
as opposed to getting wide

17:49.333 --> 17:51.200
to small like a normal breast.

17:51.200 --> 17:54.133
- But I just wanted them to fix
the problem and then,

17:54.133 --> 17:55.300
you know, they were already
gonna be there,

17:55.300 --> 17:56.467
put implants in as well.

17:56.467 --> 17:58.333
- How did they put
the implants in?

17:58.333 --> 18:00.066
I didn't see any incisions
on your breasts.

18:00.066 --> 18:02.100
- No, he put the implants
in through my abdomen.

18:02.100 --> 18:04.233
- He put the breast implants
in through your tummy?

18:04.233 --> 18:06.233
- Yeah.
- Placing implants through

18:06.233 --> 18:08.500
a tummy tuck incision--
in my opinion,

18:08.500 --> 18:12.233
it's never a good idea
because it's a long way to go,

18:12.233 --> 18:15.367
and the chance of a complication
is really high.

18:15.367 --> 18:17.100
How many hours
of surgery did you have?

18:17.100 --> 18:19.033
- 11 to 12 hours.

18:19.033 --> 18:20.300
- Yes.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.633
Out?

18:21.633 --> 18:23.633
- Out.
- Krystle's last surgery

18:23.633 --> 18:26.567
could have literally
been her last surgery.

18:26.567 --> 18:30.300
Eight hours is the time
when risks start to go up

18:30.300 --> 18:31.633
of anesthesia complications

18:31.633 --> 18:34.367
and difficulties
from prolonged recovery.

18:34.367 --> 18:36.033
- So the next day,
the nurse wakes me up,

18:36.033 --> 18:37.367
and she says,
"Shower time."

18:37.367 --> 18:38.500
- They showered you
the next day?

18:38.500 --> 18:40.233
- They showered me the next day.

18:40.233 --> 18:42.200
- Ice cold water.

18:42.200 --> 18:46.266
- Within 24 hours, they washed
you off in fresh wounds.

18:46.266 --> 18:48.266
- Contaminated,
just automatically.

18:48.266 --> 18:51.533
- Wow.
So you developed an infection.

18:51.533 --> 18:52.667
- Yes.
- Infection. Yeah.

18:52.667 --> 18:54.400
- But when you saw that pus,

18:54.400 --> 18:56.233
he didn't say anything
about all that pus?

18:56.233 --> 18:58.133
- No, he said, "Make sure
you take care of yourself,

18:58.133 --> 18:59.333
'cause I don't want you
to come back with an infection.

18:59.333 --> 19:00.667
- Oh.
- As you're sitting there

19:00.667 --> 19:02.333
pussed out.
- So he's setting you up

19:02.333 --> 19:04.066
to blame you for not...
- Yes! Yes!

19:04.066 --> 19:05.533
- Taking care of yourself.
- Yes. Exactly!

19:05.533 --> 19:07.266
- "I told you
to take care of yourself,

19:07.266 --> 19:08.667
and that's why you got
an infection,

19:08.667 --> 19:10.400
even though you already
had an infection."

19:10.400 --> 19:11.533
- Yes. I didn't find out
till after my surgery

19:11.533 --> 19:13.500
that he had since
had a stroke,

19:13.500 --> 19:15.533
and he stopped
practicing for years.

19:15.533 --> 19:18.600
- Did he look like he had any
residual effects of the stroke?

19:18.600 --> 19:21.333
- Yes, like, his arm
was kind of weird.

19:21.333 --> 19:22.667
Half of his body--
Which is weird,

19:22.667 --> 19:24.500
because this half of my body
is the half

19:24.500 --> 19:26.567
that's more messed up
than this half.

19:26.567 --> 19:29.567
- We've heard all the stories,
but we've never heard a story

19:29.567 --> 19:33.567
of a doctor that had a stroke,
still had residual effects,

19:33.567 --> 19:35.567
and then came back
and operated on a patient.

19:35.567 --> 19:39.567
- So tell us about what you
would like to have addressed.

19:39.567 --> 19:41.567
- My breasts.
I just want them symmetrical.

19:41.567 --> 19:45.567
- What about the tummy.
- My scar is really high.

19:45.567 --> 19:47.166
- I think it is, too.

19:47.166 --> 19:48.567
- So why don't we go
in the exam room,

19:48.567 --> 19:50.300
take a look, and see
what we can do, okay?

19:50.300 --> 19:52.300
- Okay.
I am nervous for the doctors

19:52.300 --> 19:55.567
to see me, because
what if the doctors say that,

19:55.567 --> 19:57.400
"We can't help you."
What do I do then?

19:57.400 --> 19:59.300
Where do I go from here?

19:59.300 --> 20:01.166
- All right, so let's start
with the chest area.

20:01.166 --> 20:03.133
Okay.
The pictures we saw,

20:03.133 --> 20:05.266
the symmastia seems
to have gotten worse.

20:05.266 --> 20:06.667
- Worse. Yeah.
Yeah, this is a lot worse.

20:06.667 --> 20:08.400
- There's absolutely no
separation between...

20:08.400 --> 20:09.734
- No.
- The right and left,

20:09.734 --> 20:11.433
And the right one's lower
than the left.

20:11.433 --> 20:13.266
Could you stand up, please?
- Yes.

20:13.266 --> 20:15.467
- Okay, so this is
a very high scar.

20:15.467 --> 20:18.600
You had a very old-fashioned
kind of tummy fuck incision

20:18.600 --> 20:21.600
called a fleur-de-Lis,
meant to help women

20:21.600 --> 20:24.533
back in the '70s and '80s
who used to wear those

20:24.533 --> 20:27.734
very high-waisted bikinis.
- Oh, yeah.

20:27.734 --> 20:29.567
- And it went out of style.

20:29.567 --> 20:32.200
So you're gonna need what's
called a symmastia repair.

20:32.200 --> 20:34.133
You're gonna need a recreation
of the pockets.

20:34.133 --> 20:36.734
You're gonna need a fixing
of your tubular deformity.

20:36.734 --> 20:40.200
You're gonna need to have
a completely new tummy tuck,

20:40.200 --> 20:43.333
so I'm willing
to go down this road

20:43.333 --> 20:45.567

This is not going go be easy.

20:45.567 --> 20:47.600

is very high.

20:50.233 --> 20:52.233

- You just got

21:46.400 --> 21:48.266
To fix Michael's
saddle nose deformity,

21:48.266 --> 21:49.734
my team will start
by harvesting rib

21:49.734 --> 21:51.667
and taking fascia
while I open the nose

21:51.667 --> 21:53.467
and rebuild the septum
with rib cartilage.

21:53.467 --> 21:55.333
I'll use spreader grafts
to open his airway

21:55.333 --> 21:56.667
and then
a septal extension graft

21:56.667 --> 21:58.600
for tip projection
and shape.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.533
Finally, I'll fracture the bones
and use diced cartilage

22:00.533 --> 22:03.200
wrapped in fascia
to build up his bridge.

22:03.200 --> 22:05.000
So we're trying to save
some anesthetic time.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.667
We have three surgeons
operating simultaneously.

22:07.667 --> 22:11.367
Dr. Peng taking rib,
Dr. Irvine harvesting fascia,

22:11.367 --> 22:13.700
and me opening up the nose.

22:13.700 --> 22:16.233
- He actually has
a huge calcification.

22:16.233 --> 22:17.500
- Yeah.

22:17.500 --> 22:20.300
This. Or is that bone?

22:20.300 --> 22:21.567
- Well, it sounds like bone.

22:21.567 --> 22:23.233
So why does he have
calcification?

22:23.233 --> 22:24.700
- I don't know.

22:24.700 --> 22:27.300
- It's very unusual
for a 32-year-old

22:27.300 --> 22:29.233
to have calcified ribs

22:29.233 --> 22:32.300
unless he underwent
a lot of trauma to his chest.

22:32.300 --> 22:36.300
So to see if the rib
below it is calcified,

22:36.300 --> 22:38.033
what would you have to do?
How much would you have

22:38.033 --> 22:39.567
to open up your incision?

22:39.567 --> 22:41.567
- Potentially a lot
'cause he's really wide.

22:41.567 --> 22:44.367
- We need to find
usable cartilage and quick.

22:44.367 --> 22:46.367
- But I'm not gonna be able
to take this one.

22:49.567 --> 22:51.567
- You haven't met Supa Woman.

22:51.567 --> 22:53.667
- Well, it's Supa Woman.

22:53.667 --> 22:56.266
- I understand.
- "Supa" means "super."

22:56.266 --> 22:59.333
Nothing says
"middle-aged white man"

- Wait a minute.
What is that?

23:03.467 --> 23:06.200
- This is blue.
It's like algae.

23:13.066 --> 23:15.233
- ♪ I want to be perfect ♪

23:16.667 --> 23:19.433
- All right, so do you want
to pack it mark it injected?

23:19.433 --> 23:21.033
- Yeah.
- Okay, so this is one of

23:21.033 --> 23:23.300
the rare occasions
that you got to make

23:23.300 --> 23:25.266
two incisions on the chest...
- Yes.

23:25.266 --> 23:27.266
- But you have to do it,
because we need a lot of rib.

23:27.266 --> 23:29.400
Unfortunately, since
Michael's ribs are calcified,

23:29.400 --> 23:31.033
we're gonna have to go down
a little bit lower in his chest

23:31.033 --> 23:32.700
and make a second incision.

23:32.700 --> 23:34.600
He's gonna be really
sore tomorrow.

23:34.600 --> 23:37.433
So you have some cartilage
that is viable,

23:37.433 --> 23:39.600
but a good amount of it
is bone again.

23:39.600 --> 23:43.100
So the question is,
is the rib you took out

23:43.100 --> 23:46.100
big enough to use
a huge septal extension graft?

23:46.100 --> 23:49.333
- I think it'll be okay.
There'll be enough of that.

23:49.333 --> 23:51.066
- Yeah.

23:51.066 --> 23:52.767
- Okay.
- That's all you got.

23:52.767 --> 23:54.767
- At least we have
some cartilage to work with now.

23:54.767 --> 23:57.600
We just have to make sure
that we have enough

23:57.600 --> 24:00.500
to extend and lengthen
Michael's nose.

24:00.500 --> 24:02.700
This is a very unusual finding.

24:02.700 --> 24:07.633
100% of the cartilaginous
septum is gone.

24:07.633 --> 24:09.600
How did that happen?
I don't know.

24:09.600 --> 24:11.367
Maybe the doctor just went
in there and whittled away

24:11.367 --> 24:13.367
and took all the septum away.

24:13.367 --> 24:16.400
All I can tell you is that
we're gonna have to reconstruct

24:16.400 --> 24:18.633
the entire
cartilaginous septum

24:18.633 --> 24:20.600
and that's not gonna be fun.

24:20.600 --> 24:23.400
To reconstruct a nose,
we took cartilage grafts,

24:23.400 --> 24:26.000
and we stitch them,
hook them up to--

24:26.000 --> 24:28.066
usually, cartilage.
Normal anatomy.

24:28.066 --> 24:30.266
In Michael's case,
there isn't any.

24:30.266 --> 24:33.000
At that point, we're starting
this septal reconstruction

24:33.000 --> 24:34.667
by adding spreader grafts.

24:34.667 --> 24:36.533
However, we got to be
really careful here

24:36.533 --> 24:38.533
with every suture we place,

24:38.533 --> 24:41.100
because the cartilage
is very brittle.

24:41.100 --> 24:43.066
It can break.
When you have brittle,

24:43.066 --> 24:45.667
rib cartilage,
we have to be very careful.

24:45.667 --> 24:48.266
If we're a little bit too harsh
on it, it will fracture it.

24:48.266 --> 24:51.533
Then the cartilage
will be not usable.

24:51.533 --> 24:54.767
That's a lot more support
than he's had before.

24:54.767 --> 24:56.400
Septum reconstructed.

24:56.400 --> 24:58.367
Septal extension
graft reconstructed.

24:58.367 --> 25:01.433
Tip re-supported
with good projection.

25:01.433 --> 25:03.400
Tough case.
I mean, the biggest difference

25:03.400 --> 25:05.567
is that Michael's gonna have
a normal-appearing nose

25:05.567 --> 25:08.166
and the inability
to squish his nose

25:08.166 --> 25:09.533
all the way to his lips.

25:09.533 --> 25:11.433
As long as Michael heals well,

25:11.433 --> 25:13.033
he better get that ring
on her finger pretty fast.

- Hi.
- Patricia, hi.

25:35.300 --> 25:36.667
- Nice to meet you.
I'm a hugger.

25:36.667 --> 25:37.667
You want a hug?

25:37.667 --> 25:39.433
- Yes.
- Okay.

25:39.433 --> 25:41.667
- Everyone knows I like butts,
but damn,

25:41.667 --> 25:43.467
this butt is huge.

25:43.467 --> 25:45.734
- Patricia, first thing I want
to ask you,

25:45.734 --> 25:47.734
what do you do?
- I work at a steel mill.

25:47.734 --> 25:49.433
- Yes.

25:49.433 --> 25:50.734
- My department,

25:50.734 --> 25:52.700
we turn molten steel
into solid form...

25:52.700 --> 25:54.333
- So I do everything

25:54.333 --> 25:56.734
from operate the crane,
carrying 350 tons

25:56.734 --> 25:58.600
of molten steel everywhere.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.533
- On the line with the guys
doing all that...

26:00.533 --> 26:02.467
- I'm the only girl ever.

26:02.467 --> 26:05.166
I was the first and only female
in my job description.

26:05.166 --> 26:08.333
- No kidding.
I would never in a million years

26:08.333 --> 26:10.467
guess this woman
sitting in front of me

26:10.467 --> 26:11.734
worked in a steel mill.

26:11.734 --> 26:14.433
It's about as probable as Paul

26:14.433 --> 26:16.734
working as a dancer
in a strip club.

26:16.734 --> 26:19.600
- 12 to 16.

26:21.567 --> 26:23.500
- Mandatory 12,
'cause I'm the only one

26:23.500 --> 26:25.467
that's qualified to do
every job in the building.

26:25.467 --> 26:27.500
I'm proud of myself.
I've worked my way

26:27.500 --> 26:30.100
from the bottom to the top.

26:30.100 --> 26:33.100
- The way you're dressed,
would you dress like this...

26:33.100 --> 26:35.100
after work,
or what's the deal here?

26:35.100 --> 26:37.500
- Today,
you have met Supa Woman.

26:37.500 --> 26:38.767
- Yes.

26:38.767 --> 26:40.567
- Supa Woman.
- Supa Woman.

26:40.567 --> 26:42.233
- Well, it's Super Woman, but...

26:42.233 --> 26:44.100
- It means super.
- I mean, I understand, but--

26:44.100 --> 26:46.600
- "Supa" means "super."
- I get that, but what is--

26:46.600 --> 26:48.767
- Like "supa" dumb.

26:48.767 --> 26:50.633
Let's be honest:
nothing says

26:50.633 --> 26:52.767
"middle-aged white man"

26:52.767 --> 26:54.767
more than
misunderstanding slang.

26:54.767 --> 26:56.500
- Patricia is the steel worker.

26:56.500 --> 26:59.500
Supa Woman is who I transform
into when I'm--

26:59.500 --> 27:02.066
- It's your alter ego.
- I model, DJ...

27:02.066 --> 27:04.000
- Yes.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.233
- Patricia is
a very strange dichotomy.

27:06.233 --> 27:08.633
I don't really understand it,
but I'll be honest with you,

27:08.633 --> 27:10.667
it's so cool.

27:10.667 --> 27:13.000
So when you DJing
you're doing the whole...

27:13.000 --> 27:14.734
- All that.
- This and the this and the...

27:14.734 --> 27:16.667
- No, I definitely don't.

27:16.667 --> 27:17.667
- How to do that.

27:17.667 --> 27:19.500
Give us a demo.

27:21.266 --> 27:23.133
Oh, I can do that.
- Yeah.

27:23.133 --> 27:25.667
- I'm gonna watch you guys
do it.

27:25.667 --> 27:28.000
- I'm letting him do it for me.
- Yes!

27:29.100 --> 27:32.533
Dr. Dubrow is awesome.

27:32.533 --> 27:34.066
Like, he didn't really
have it together,

27:34.066 --> 27:35.533
but with some more practice,

27:35.533 --> 27:39.000
I'm sure he'll
out there doing it, too.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.600
- So I guess the thing
that's most prominent

27:41.600 --> 27:43.400
is the buttock area.
- Yes.

27:43.400 --> 27:46.233
- So you had liposuction
and fat transfer

27:46.233 --> 27:48.133
grafting into the buttock area.
- Yes. Yes.

27:48.133 --> 27:49.667
- A Brazilian butt lift.
- Yes.

27:49.667 --> 27:51.533
- 1,200 CCs.

27:51.533 --> 27:55.133
- So you had 1,200
CCs put in each buttock?

27:55.133 --> 27:56.567
- Mm-hmm.

27:56.567 --> 27:57.567
- So what happened
the second time?

27:57.567 --> 27:58.567
- Second time,

27:58.567 --> 28:00.266
that doctor put 900 CCs.

28:00.266 --> 28:03.767
- So you have 2,100 CCs of fat

28:03.767 --> 28:05.700
in each buttock cheek?
- Yes.

28:05.700 --> 28:08.700
- Supa booty. "Supa" booty.
Not "super" booty.

28:08.700 --> 28:11.133
"Supa" booty. Supa booty.

28:11.133 --> 28:13.233
- I'm happy with the size...
- Yeah. Yeah.

28:13.233 --> 28:16.033
I would hope so.
See--see--okay.

28:16.033 --> 28:20.033
- But the shape--it kind of took
on a flat kind of,

28:20.033 --> 28:21.667
like, surface on it.
- Mm-hmm.

28:21.667 --> 28:23.166
- What do you think is
the way to correct that?

28:23.166 --> 28:24.567
- A little bit
more fat grafting.

28:24.567 --> 28:25.633
- To bring out
the flatter areas?

28:25.633 --> 28:27.166
- Yes.
- Okay.

28:27.166 --> 28:28.734
- Do you actually think
she needs more fat?

28:28.734 --> 28:30.467
- I don't think
she needs more fat.

28:30.467 --> 28:32.200
I think she's beautiful
the way that she is.

28:32.200 --> 28:34.066
- I think in order to figure out
whether it's a good idea

28:34.066 --> 28:35.734
to do that or not,
why don't we go in the exam room

28:35.734 --> 28:37.333
and take a careful look
and figure out

28:37.333 --> 28:39.066
what your best options
might be, okay?

28:39.066 --> 28:40.533
- Okay.
- Great.

28:43.266 --> 28:45.200
- Is that--
You're kidding me.

28:45.200 --> 28:47.166
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my God.

28:47.166 --> 28:50.133
- Just when you thought
it couldn't get any stranger.

28:50.133 --> 28:52.734
- This guy can dance.
- Just like...

28:52.734 --> 28:54.233
Yes!

28:55.300 --> 28:58.000
- Y'all keep y'all day jobs.

29:04.133 --> 29:06.033
- ♪ I want to be perfect ♪

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
- Stand up and let's look
at the area.

29:10.233 --> 29:13.700
Okay. Okay.

29:13.700 --> 29:17.633
Anatomically, she puts
the "maximus" in "gluteus."

29:18.300 --> 29:21.166
- That's probably the biggest
BBL that I've ever seen.

29:21.166 --> 29:22.767
- Yeah.
- So the flat areas

29:22.767 --> 29:24.333
you're concerned about
are where

29:24.333 --> 29:26.633
You knew exactly where to go.

29:26.633 --> 29:30.166
- If a person were to have
concerns about flattening,

29:30.166 --> 29:32.233
this is the area
they would have concerns in,

29:32.233 --> 29:34.300
and typically,
people--when they have

29:34.300 --> 29:37.433
this much fat put in,
have very hard areas,

29:37.433 --> 29:39.700
and you don't have
any tender areas?

29:39.700 --> 29:41.734
- No.
- You've done very well.

29:41.734 --> 29:45.233
I'm surprised that Patricia
hasn't had any complications,

29:45.233 --> 29:47.633
because that,
at the end of the day,

29:47.633 --> 29:50.734
is too much fat,
and it is very dangerous.

29:50.734 --> 29:54.233
You do have a couple little
smaller ridge areas,

29:54.233 --> 29:55.667
but let me just
tell you something--

29:55.667 --> 29:57.467
and I'm gonna tell you
the truth, okay?

29:57.467 --> 30:00.333
You have been very lucky.

30:00.333 --> 30:02.667
When you fill up
a fat compartment,

30:02.667 --> 30:04.667
there's basically three things
in that compartment:

30:04.667 --> 30:07.200
arteries, veins, and the fat.

30:07.200 --> 30:10.667
The arteries and veins are aware
that there's more stuff

30:10.667 --> 30:12.367
that needs to be
supplied with oxygen,

30:12.367 --> 30:15.200
and you get bigger arteries
and bigger veins,

30:15.200 --> 30:18.066
but as you put more
and more fat in there,

30:18.066 --> 30:20.667
it's being displaced
into areas it can go to

30:20.667 --> 30:22.767
which is the arteries and veins.

30:22.767 --> 30:26.066
These veins are connected
to the main veins,

30:26.066 --> 30:28.000
which lead to the lung.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.734
If you get fat
that goes over to the lung

30:30.734 --> 30:33.500
and blocks off,
you don't just get a little

30:33.500 --> 30:36.433
short of breath; you...
both: Die.

30:38.233 --> 30:40.133
- No matter what type
of surgery,

30:40.133 --> 30:41.767
you're always taking
that chance.

30:41.767 --> 30:44.367
Like, you never know
if you're gonna be able

30:44.367 --> 30:46.300
to open your eyes,
like, once you're done.

30:46.300 --> 30:48.767
So I really, really, really
appreciate the information.

30:48.767 --> 30:53.266
- Do not let anybody stick
any more fat in that butt.

30:53.266 --> 30:56.300
- I sense the genuine.
- Oh, yeah.

30:56.300 --> 30:58.233
What I like about Patricia is,

30:58.233 --> 31:00.400
as opposed to a lot of patients
who come to us,

31:00.400 --> 31:03.767
she's listening to us and
we're getting through to her.

31:03.767 --> 31:06.300
And enough is enough.

31:06.300 --> 31:08.567
- So, sorry to throw that down.
- So the final thing is--

31:08.567 --> 31:10.100
The final thing is...
- Throw that down.

31:11.367 --> 31:13.200
The shoki.
- Yes.

31:13.200 --> 31:14.400
- I'm not doing it.
- This guy can dance.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.400
You can do that.
- I can't.

31:16.400 --> 31:18.200
- Maybe he can do like this.

31:18.200 --> 31:20.433
- Oh, I could do that.
- Yes.

31:20.433 --> 31:25.734
- Yes!

31:25.734 --> 31:28.467
- Y'all keep y'all day jobs.

31:28.467 --> 31:35.066
♪ ♪

31:35.066 --> 31:37.000
- Hello.
- Hi. Good morning.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.133
- Check-in for Krystle.
- Okay, go ahead and sign in.

31:39.133 --> 31:40.734
- Looking back on everything,

31:40.734 --> 31:43.400
this experience
has been completely different.

31:43.400 --> 31:45.467
I can't believe that I'm here.
I can't believe that

31:45.467 --> 31:47.400
I'm finally gonna get
the surgery

31:47.400 --> 31:50.333
that I always hoped for.

31:50.333 --> 31:52.300
- Krystle's surgery today
is a little daunting

31:52.300 --> 31:55.100
because she has so many
different things wrong

31:55.100 --> 31:57.100
with two sections of her body.

31:57.100 --> 31:59.100
Krystle's having
very long surgery,

31:59.100 --> 32:00.500
very significant surgery,

32:00.500 --> 32:02.767
and I have my work
cut out for me today.

32:02.767 --> 32:04.467
Today, for Krystle's surgery,

32:04.467 --> 32:06.166
I'll correct the symmastia
in her chest

32:06.166 --> 32:08.100
by removing her old implants

32:08.100 --> 32:10.300
and the create newly
separated breast pockets.

32:10.300 --> 32:12.467
Then I'll fix her tubular
breast deformity

32:12.467 --> 32:15.734
by making releasing incisions
inside her breast tissue.

32:15.734 --> 32:18.734
Next, I'll make an incision
at the bottom of her abdomen

32:18.734 --> 32:20.433
and remove the excess skin,

32:20.433 --> 32:22.734
which will both reduce
her stretch marks

32:22.734 --> 32:25.467
and lower her
outdated tummy tuck scar.

32:25.467 --> 32:27.767
So let's make an incision
and go see whether

32:27.767 --> 32:30.033
the implants are
above or below the muscle.

32:32.367 --> 32:35.100
Yes! I think
they're above the muscle.

32:35.100 --> 32:38.500
Here. What is this?

32:38.500 --> 32:41.767
This is blue.
It's like algae.

32:41.767 --> 32:44.233
So this is a textured implant

32:44.233 --> 32:46.400
made by a company
that I've never heard of.

32:46.400 --> 32:50.400
Breast implants go in clear
and sterile most of the time,

32:50.400 --> 32:53.133
but if there's a break
in the technique,

32:53.133 --> 32:55.233
like a bacteria
that's introduced into it,

32:55.233 --> 32:57.533
that can slowly grow
over the years.

32:57.533 --> 32:59.767
Luckily, it doesn't appear
that Krystle has

32:59.767 --> 33:02.266
any sort of fungus
growing inside of her.

33:02.266 --> 33:04.233
We've got to do the same thing
on the left side.

33:06.200 --> 33:09.433
Wait a minute. What is that?
Looks like muscle.

33:12.266 --> 33:14.533
Was he under the muscle
on the left side

33:14.533 --> 33:17.266
and on top of the muscle
on the right side?

33:17.266 --> 33:19.433
Is that--you're kidding me.

33:19.433 --> 33:21.500
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my God.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.433
- Just when you thought
it couldn't get any stranger.

33:23.433 --> 33:26.033
- I can imagine
how this happened here,

33:26.033 --> 33:28.033
because it's incredibly
difficult

33:28.033 --> 33:31.100
to get a good visualization
of the dissection

33:31.100 --> 33:33.100
up there from a tummy
tuck incision

33:33.100 --> 33:36.133
in order to determine
what plane you're really in.

33:36.133 --> 33:38.500
What side did that guy
have a stroke on?

33:38.500 --> 33:40.533
- Then he couldn't dissect
on the one side.

33:40.533 --> 33:44.033
- Okay, so now I have to do
a neo-subpectoral pocket

33:44.033 --> 33:46.166
on this side,
which makes achieving symmetry

33:46.166 --> 33:48.100
that much more difficult.

33:48.100 --> 33:51.533
A neo-subpectoral pocket
is when you create a new pocket

33:51.533 --> 33:53.433
in order to place the implant

33:53.433 --> 33:56.166
and not have it move
into its old pocket.

33:56.166 --> 33:58.233
Because we've done
different operations

33:58.233 --> 33:59.633
and they're in
different locations,

33:59.633 --> 34:02.066
it may be very hard
to get them symmetrical,

34:02.066 --> 34:03.400
but we have no choice.

34:03.400 --> 34:05.300
- Looks amazing.
- Okay.

34:05.300 --> 34:07.567
Let's put her down, and then
let's tackle the stomach.

34:07.567 --> 34:11.600
So now we're gonna address
the extra scar

34:11.600 --> 34:15.200
she has on the side.
So we're gonna lower it.

34:15.200 --> 34:18.533
Lowering a tummy tuck scar
is really difficult.

34:18.533 --> 34:21.600
If it's tight to begin with,
how do you lower it

34:21.600 --> 34:24.066
without putting it under
a great tension

34:24.066 --> 34:25.467
and increasing the chance

34:25.467 --> 34:27.200
of the wound
from splitting apart?

34:27.200 --> 34:29.200
It still looks weird,
don't you think?

34:29.200 --> 34:31.066
- Yep.
- Krystle's surgery

34:31.066 --> 34:33.333
was extremely complex,
but at the end of the day,

34:33.333 --> 34:36.300
I'm actually pretty happy.
All right.

34:36.300 --> 34:38.133
- Clear.
- Let's close. We nailed it.

34:38.133 --> 34:39.467

- It was not easy.

34:47.433 --> 34:49.166

34:49.166 --> 34:51.200
ten being the worst pain,
it's, like, a 20.

34:51.200 --> 34:53.100
- When someone's had these
combined surgeries,

34:53.100 --> 34:55.166
that can lead to blood clots
in your legs,

34:55.166 --> 34:58.066

to your lungs and kill you.

coming out there to save me,

How you doing, buddy?

My ribs hurt.

35:41.400 --> 35:44.133
I don't know
if I'm just being a baby,

35:44.133 --> 35:45.633

of the top three pains

35:45.633 --> 35:47.500

35:57.667 --> 35:59.467
Always better.

35:59.467 --> 36:02.266
- All right, let's talk.
All your septal cartilage--

36:02.266 --> 36:04.500
100% of it, was gone.

36:04.500 --> 36:08.300
So your rib, despite not having
any trauma, was calcified.

36:08.300 --> 36:12.667
I mean, the whole rib
there was really calcified.

36:12.667 --> 36:14.533
We left that rib alone.

36:14.533 --> 36:18.166
Then, the upper one had
some calcification on that one,

36:18.166 --> 36:22.266
but we had just enough rib,
so it worked out beautifully.

36:22.266 --> 36:23.700
- I didn't think about it,

36:23.700 --> 36:28.300
but I have done gymnastics
for ten years.

36:28.300 --> 36:30.700
A lot of that bar work on
the high bar.

36:30.700 --> 36:33.433
A lot of chest.
- Oh, you're hitting your chest.

36:33.433 --> 36:35.700
- Hitting your chest a lot.
- Well, it's interesting.

36:35.700 --> 36:38.100
I mean, that's more of a
learning thing for me, too,

36:38.100 --> 36:43.300
that even kind of a gentle,
blunt trauma to the chest...

36:43.300 --> 36:45.166
- Yeah.
- Can calcify rib.

36:45.166 --> 36:47.200

I want to keep in mind

You know, so your nose,
when we were done with it,

36:51.600 --> 36:54.734

Now, take your finger--

36:56.467 --> 36:59.200

the blood flowing in your legs.

37:50.233 --> 37:52.200
Because when someone's had
these combined surgeries,

37:52.200 --> 37:54.333
it compresses the veins
in your pelvis,
