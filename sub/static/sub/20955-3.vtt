WEBVTT

00:02.770 --> 00:03.904
TERESA: Previously on
Queen of the South...

00:03.937 --> 00:06.240
(speaking Spanish)

00:06.274 --> 00:08.008
You're not
going with your father.

00:08.042 --> 00:09.543
I don't want to be with you!

00:09.577 --> 00:10.978
CAMILA: How many have we lost?

00:11.011 --> 00:12.046
JAMES: All of them.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.414
Camila needs product.

00:13.447 --> 00:15.149
Entonces vamos
a hacer un trato.

00:15.183 --> 00:16.584
About those funds you requested,

00:16.617 --> 00:18.419
I think I may have
a work-around.

00:18.452 --> 00:20.754
Teo was a risk to both of us.

00:20.788 --> 00:22.190
(crying)
Oh, my God.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.657
TERESA: You left me.

00:23.691 --> 00:24.892
Look, Epifanio, he was--

00:24.925 --> 00:26.194
he was on his way to kill me.

00:26.227 --> 00:27.495
They had to do something, okay?

00:27.528 --> 00:29.363
-Who's "they"?
-The DEA.

00:29.397 --> 00:31.665
TERESA: Camila finds out
about the DEA, she'll kill you.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.867
Guero's gonna lead us
to the mother lode. You watch.

00:33.901 --> 00:37.371
(dramatic music)

00:39.073 --> 00:42.210
(serene music)

00:42.243 --> 00:44.845
*

00:44.878 --> 00:46.614
(kisses)

00:46.647 --> 00:48.249
I love you.

00:48.282 --> 00:49.517
(phone buzzing)

00:49.550 --> 00:51.051
(kisses)
Hold on.

00:57.258 --> 01:00.928
Epifanio needs me to do a run.

01:00.961 --> 01:02.630
(breathes deeply)

01:02.663 --> 01:04.232
Screw him.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.634
-(exhales)
-Let's stay in bed all day.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.074
This is Marbella,

01:14.108 --> 01:15.809
in la Costa del Sol
de España.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.211
It's beautiful.

01:17.245 --> 01:18.279
You ever been?

01:18.312 --> 01:19.313
Yeah, I flew a little hash

01:19.347 --> 01:21.115
there once from Morocco.

01:21.149 --> 01:25.219
Never stopped thinking
about this place.

01:25.253 --> 01:26.254
Let's go right now.

01:26.287 --> 01:27.555
(soft laugh)

01:27.588 --> 01:29.723
-Screw Epifanio.
-Screw Epifanio.

01:29.757 --> 01:30.724
You know how to fly.

01:30.758 --> 01:31.892
Let's go.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.128
That's the plan.

01:34.162 --> 01:36.664
(sighs)
I can't do this forever.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.399
Let's go.
Let's do it.

01:38.432 --> 01:39.967
Let's leave Culiacán.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.635
I'll fly you
anywhere you want to go,

01:41.669 --> 01:42.970
anywhere in the world.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.308
And maybe one day,

01:47.341 --> 01:49.743
we can get ourselves
a little house on the beach.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.745
Just drink cold sangria,

01:51.779 --> 01:54.948
make love all day in the sand.

01:54.982 --> 01:56.584
How's that sound?

01:56.617 --> 01:58.819
As long as I'm with you.

02:00.854 --> 02:01.955
No.

02:01.989 --> 02:03.324
I gots to go.

02:03.357 --> 02:05.659
Stay.

02:05.693 --> 02:08.095
I love you.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.863
I love you too.

02:09.897 --> 02:11.599
Stay.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.301
I can't.

02:14.568 --> 02:19.773
*

02:19.807 --> 02:21.108
Hey, Chino,

02:21.141 --> 02:22.543
we gotta move
that coke fast, man.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.178
You done cutting it yet?

02:24.212 --> 02:25.213
Okay.

02:25.246 --> 02:28.516
(speaking Spanish)

02:34.588 --> 02:35.689
(tires squealing)

02:35.723 --> 02:38.392
(dramatic music)

02:38.426 --> 02:41.362
(tires screech)

02:41.395 --> 02:43.464
LOYA: Get out!

02:43.497 --> 02:44.532
Get out the plane.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.166
Who the hell are you?

02:46.200 --> 02:48.902
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.504
Get in the car.
Move!

02:50.538 --> 02:55.976
*

02:56.009 --> 02:58.246
(explosion)

02:59.213 --> 03:02.149
(tense music)

03:02.182 --> 03:05.152
(cell phone chiming)

03:05.185 --> 03:12.159
*

03:12.192 --> 03:13.694
(phone beeps)

03:15.796 --> 03:18.266
¿Sí?

03:18.299 --> 03:21.235
LOYA: You don't know me, Teresa.

03:21.269 --> 03:23.704
Guero's dead.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.739
Get out of the house now.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.741
(phone beeps)

03:27.775 --> 03:29.877
GUERO: Thank you.

03:29.910 --> 03:32.079
She must be really special.

03:32.112 --> 03:34.081
She is.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.017
(slow country music over radio)

03:37.050 --> 03:38.352
Epifanio blew up your plane

03:38.386 --> 03:39.387
because you were
stealing from him.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.754
Yep.

03:40.788 --> 03:44.091
For us, Teresa.

03:44.124 --> 03:47.261
I did it for us
so we could start over.

03:47.295 --> 03:50.898
Go to Spain
like we talked about?

03:50.931 --> 03:53.100
Drink cold sangria
and make love all day

03:53.133 --> 03:54.468
in the white sand.

03:54.502 --> 03:57.104
That's right.

03:57.137 --> 03:59.773
It was a good plan, wasn't it?

03:59.807 --> 04:02.242
I've been through so much.

04:02.276 --> 04:03.377
(brooding music)

04:03.411 --> 04:06.780
I know.

04:06.814 --> 04:09.149
I saw your bed
at the warehouse.

04:09.182 --> 04:10.818
*

04:10.851 --> 04:13.421
(gentle music)

04:13.454 --> 04:16.890
How can I make this right?

04:16.924 --> 04:19.760
(soft dramatic music)

04:19.793 --> 04:21.995
*

04:22.029 --> 04:23.230
Shit.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.765
LOYA: Miss Mendoza.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.767
I'm Agent Loya.
This is Agent Finnerman.

04:26.800 --> 04:27.835
We're with the DEA.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.002
Hey, I didn't--hey--

04:29.036 --> 04:30.003
-Hey--
-Don't touch me.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.272
(tense music)

04:32.306 --> 04:33.441
This wasn't me.

04:33.474 --> 04:36.777
*

04:36.810 --> 04:41.782
(dramatic music)

04:45.853 --> 04:47.821
(indistinct talking)

04:47.855 --> 04:50.591
(sniffs)

04:50.624 --> 04:52.460
FINNERMAN: He didn't set you
up...

04:52.493 --> 04:54.328
if that's what you're thinking.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.432
We followed him.

04:58.466 --> 04:59.833
In my experience,

04:59.867 --> 05:01.335
men are the weaker sex

05:01.369 --> 05:03.537
when it comes to matters
of the heart.

05:03.571 --> 05:06.006
What do you want?

05:06.039 --> 05:08.642
For you to cooperate in our
investigation of Camila Vargas.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.878
Miss Mendoza,

05:10.911 --> 05:12.646
I know you're a good person
in a bad situation.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.281
And you're going to save me?

05:14.314 --> 05:15.716
Camila Vargas

05:15.749 --> 05:17.284
is a cold-blooded criminal

05:17.317 --> 05:19.953
who uses loyalty
as her currency.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.689
Only way out is with a bullet.

05:21.722 --> 05:24.892
It won't even be her
that pulls the trigger.

05:24.925 --> 05:27.861
I'd wager you've already got
blood on your hands for her.

05:27.895 --> 05:29.797
If I tell you anything,

05:29.830 --> 05:31.532
what happens to me?

05:31.565 --> 05:33.401
To Guero?

05:33.434 --> 05:35.636
FINNERMAN: We'll put you both
in witness protection.

05:35.669 --> 05:38.305
United States government
will keep you safe and sound.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.541
Like you did in Culiacán?

05:40.574 --> 05:42.543
If we didn't have surveillance
on Epifanio Vargas,

05:42.576 --> 05:44.878
your boyfriend would have
been blown to pieces.

05:44.912 --> 05:47.314
The fact is, the DEA

05:47.347 --> 05:49.316
doesn't have
anything concrete on you.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.051
But my buddies over at ICE

05:51.084 --> 05:54.221
would love to toss
your illegal ass back to Mexico.

05:54.254 --> 05:56.690
I wonder how long it'd take
Epifanio to find you.

05:56.724 --> 05:59.359
I'd give you 48 hours.

06:02.463 --> 06:04.532
Understand this:

06:04.565 --> 06:08.235
those people
are not your friends.

06:08.268 --> 06:09.837
And you can't afford
any more enemies.

06:09.870 --> 06:16.877
*

06:20.414 --> 06:21.715
(engine cuts out)

06:30.057 --> 06:32.526
(pensive guitar music)

06:32.560 --> 06:33.761
(gun clicks)

06:33.794 --> 06:35.696
(door opens)

06:35.729 --> 06:37.064
Where you been?

06:37.097 --> 06:39.266
Went to get a few things.

06:39.299 --> 06:41.268
For three hours?

06:41.301 --> 06:43.070
Car overheated.

06:43.103 --> 06:45.372
You springed a leak?

06:45.405 --> 06:47.240
I'm not a mechanic.

06:47.274 --> 06:48.408
Dinner's ready.

06:59.453 --> 07:01.088
What?

07:01.121 --> 07:02.823
Trying to lose a few pounds.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.592
Thanks for the heads up.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.760
I really appreciate you
letting me know about it.

07:11.298 --> 07:12.933
That was a former associate

07:12.966 --> 07:15.302
that works for
the Colombians now.

07:15.335 --> 07:17.971
He just contacted me
to let me know that Epifanio

07:18.005 --> 07:19.640
is meeting with
Reynaldo Fieto.

07:19.673 --> 07:22.442
He's about to flood
the Texas market with product.

07:22.476 --> 07:24.177
And we're just about to get
our Jimenez shipment.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.813
It's not the best timing.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.481
Well, Epifanio took out
all of the lieutenants,

07:27.515 --> 07:29.683
so I don't know
who's moving the product.

07:29.717 --> 07:31.785
But one thing's for certain,

07:31.819 --> 07:34.287
we cannot allow them
to reach Texas.

07:34.321 --> 07:36.123
If we cut off
their transport route,

07:36.156 --> 07:39.660
his distributors will
come crawling back to us.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.795
We just need to confirm
that his tunnel's active.

07:41.829 --> 07:44.164
Well, if it is,

07:44.197 --> 07:46.299
destroy it.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.601
Take Teresa with you
to the border.

07:47.635 --> 07:48.602
(brooding music)

07:48.636 --> 07:51.605
Why?

07:51.639 --> 07:54.542
Leave me in the kitchen
like a pinche vieja?

07:54.575 --> 07:57.611
No.
I'll go instead of her--

07:57.645 --> 07:59.179
No.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.949
I need all my security
at hand for protection.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.151
Teresa,

08:04.184 --> 08:06.053
you'll be less conspicuous
with James.

08:06.086 --> 08:09.222
I thought I was done
with this type of work.

08:09.256 --> 08:10.390
*

08:10.423 --> 08:13.527
Epifanio thinks we're weak.

08:13.561 --> 08:15.563
He's let his guard down.

08:15.596 --> 08:17.197
When you're at war,

08:17.230 --> 08:18.799
it's best to strike your enemy

08:18.832 --> 08:20.668
when he least expects it.

08:22.269 --> 08:23.470
Go now.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.472
*

08:25.505 --> 08:26.740
We got a long drive
ahead of us.

08:26.774 --> 08:27.841
We should get moving.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.645
Thank you, Pote.

08:31.679 --> 08:32.680
Be careful.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.524
I'll start tomorrow.

08:49.262 --> 08:50.430
(knocking on door)

08:52.866 --> 08:55.202
Are you ready?

08:55.235 --> 08:56.837
If the tunnel is still active,

08:56.870 --> 08:59.673
it'll be surrounded
by Epifanio's men.

08:59.707 --> 09:01.775
You know he still
wants to kill me.

09:01.809 --> 09:02.843
You escaped my husband's wrath

09:02.876 --> 09:04.511
since you fled Culiacán.

09:04.544 --> 09:05.913
I have no doubt

09:05.946 --> 09:07.615
your wits will
keep you safe once more.

09:07.648 --> 09:09.549
And if they don't?

09:09.583 --> 09:11.251
We lost everything

09:11.284 --> 09:13.754
and everyone that
meant anything to us.

09:13.787 --> 09:16.590
You mustn't question your value.

09:16.624 --> 09:19.292
We only have each other now.

09:19.326 --> 09:22.095
I'm sorry I doubted you.

09:22.129 --> 09:23.864
And, Teresa,

09:23.897 --> 09:25.966
acuerdate,

09:25.999 --> 09:31.138
(speaking Spanish)

09:31.171 --> 09:33.240
We're the same.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.108
Never forget that.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.577
(tense music)

09:37.611 --> 09:39.379
*

09:39.412 --> 09:41.214
Reynaldo,

09:41.248 --> 09:44.217
(speaking Spanish)

09:44.251 --> 09:46.353
and we have done
very well together.

09:47.755 --> 09:49.723
And you keep getting
more and more handsome,

09:49.757 --> 09:50.991
and I just get older and fatter.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.325
(men chuckle)

09:52.359 --> 09:54.094
(speaking Spanish)

09:54.127 --> 09:55.428
You look
as strong as ever.

09:55.462 --> 09:57.731
Tell that to my wife.

09:57.765 --> 09:59.332
She took me off meat.

09:59.366 --> 10:00.734
I can't have salt.

10:00.768 --> 10:02.269
I can't have sugar.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.171
If she cuts me off
the cerveza,

10:04.204 --> 10:05.973
I'm not gonna have a reason
to wake up in the morning.

10:06.006 --> 10:09.743
I know about wives
trying to take things away.

10:09.777 --> 10:12.012
I have you beat, my friend.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.013
(glasses clink)

10:13.046 --> 10:14.281
Hm.

10:15.115 --> 10:18.451
So you will
understand my reticence.

10:18.485 --> 10:20.954
All this turmoil, open violence,

10:20.988 --> 10:23.623
it's like a lighthouse
for competition.

10:23.657 --> 10:25.258
Don't tell me
you're getting soft.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.360
Hm.

10:27.394 --> 10:28.862
Now you sound like my wife.

10:28.896 --> 10:30.764
-(chuckles)
-(chuckles softly)

10:30.798 --> 10:34.768
My people count on me
to mitigate risks.

10:34.802 --> 10:37.204
How can I be sure my goods
are safe in your hands?

10:37.237 --> 10:38.305
Listen--

10:38.338 --> 10:39.807
Don Reynaldo, forgive me,

10:39.840 --> 10:41.341
but I do believe
you're underestimating

10:41.374 --> 10:43.376
the governor's power
of imagination.

10:43.410 --> 10:44.712
Your product

10:44.745 --> 10:47.614
has never been more safe.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.316
Really?

10:49.349 --> 10:50.617
How is that?

10:50.650 --> 10:52.285
The governor has been relentless

10:52.319 --> 10:54.054
when it comes to
security and innovation.

10:54.087 --> 10:58.491
(speaking Spanish)

11:01.328 --> 11:02.362
(speaking Spanish)

11:02.395 --> 11:03.997
This is a toy.

11:04.031 --> 11:05.833
These drones

11:05.866 --> 11:08.135
offer the highest level
of security

11:08.168 --> 11:10.470
for an important businessman
such as yourself.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.740
In fact, they're being
employed for protection

11:12.773 --> 11:16.309
over Governor Vargas'
entire property as we speak.

11:16.343 --> 11:19.046
It shoots 15 photos per second.

11:19.079 --> 11:21.348
And we can control it
from over four miles away.

11:21.381 --> 11:24.351
This... is not a toy.

11:24.384 --> 11:25.919
No.
(soft chuckle)

11:25.953 --> 11:28.255
This is fantastic.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.023
I am happy that you're happy.

11:30.057 --> 11:33.360
-Bueno.
-No, I'm not happy, I'm angry,

11:33.393 --> 11:35.328
thinking about how much
money it's going to cost

11:35.362 --> 11:38.899
to hire a brilliant mind
like this verraco.

11:38.932 --> 11:40.768
(speaking Spanish)

11:40.801 --> 11:42.069
Salud, mi hermano.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.603
Salud.

11:43.636 --> 11:46.173
(muffled pop music,
girls giggling)

11:46.206 --> 11:47.707
Perdón.

11:47.741 --> 11:49.209
(pop music playing)

11:49.242 --> 11:52.512
(photos snapping)

11:52.545 --> 11:54.848
What are you doing?

11:54.882 --> 11:57.350
Sending Lado
a pic of my chichis.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.352
Boys want badass chingonas,

11:59.386 --> 12:00.387
and not some prissy
daddy's girl,

12:00.420 --> 12:01.855
like you.

12:01.889 --> 12:03.456
I gotta look respectable.

12:03.490 --> 12:06.026
I'm a daughter of
a governor now.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.728
Bela, I know you are
excited about the birthday,

12:08.762 --> 12:09.797
but

12:09.830 --> 12:12.065
I'm in a business meeting.

12:12.099 --> 12:13.700
Hello, Olivia.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.870
*

12:16.904 --> 12:18.138
Happy birthday, mi'ja.

12:18.171 --> 12:19.973
Thank you.

12:20.007 --> 12:22.042
-I love it.
-Mm.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.144
Only the best for you,
but, please,

12:24.177 --> 12:25.378
keep the music down, okay?

12:25.412 --> 12:28.448
*

12:28.481 --> 12:29.883
(door shuts)

12:29.917 --> 12:31.151
Does he think you're having tea

12:31.184 --> 12:32.285
with the Queen of England?

12:32.319 --> 12:35.322
(phone buzzes)

12:39.159 --> 12:40.593
(line beeps)

12:40.627 --> 12:42.229
Hi.

12:42.262 --> 12:45.298
Izzy, it's, uh, Mommy.

12:45.332 --> 12:49.069
You know, I know we haven't
talked in a while, but

12:49.102 --> 12:51.238
I was just wondering

12:51.271 --> 12:53.807
what are you doing
for your birthday?

12:53.841 --> 12:56.944
Maybe you can come
visit me some time.

12:56.977 --> 12:58.445
(somber music)

12:58.478 --> 13:00.981
Call me, please.

13:01.014 --> 13:03.450
*

13:03.483 --> 13:05.418
Te quiero.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.354
Te quiero mucho.

13:07.387 --> 13:14.361
*

13:16.997 --> 13:18.966
(footsteps approach,
door opens)

13:18.999 --> 13:21.434
Camila, thank you so much
for coming in the office.

13:21.468 --> 13:22.970
Can I get you something
to drink? A wat--

13:23.003 --> 13:24.838
What's happening with the DEA?

13:24.872 --> 13:26.339
Not much.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.041
Just a couple of
government hacks

13:28.075 --> 13:30.010
sniffing around.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.644
Well, I pay your firm
a hefty amount

13:31.678 --> 13:34.281
to ensure that
my financial matters

13:34.314 --> 13:35.782
are above board.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.450
They are.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.452
Mateo handled the purchase of

13:39.486 --> 13:40.988
your trawler company flawlessly

13:41.021 --> 13:43.290
and attorney-client privilege

13:43.323 --> 13:44.491
protects you and
your present dealings.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.226
Which are?

13:46.259 --> 13:48.295
Well, you're a legitimate
businesswoman in Dallas.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.397
As far as I'm concerned,
any innuendo

13:50.430 --> 13:52.966
that you're involved
in criminal activity,

13:53.000 --> 13:57.070
much less a drug cartel,
is not only absurd,

13:57.104 --> 13:59.472
it's libel-worthy.

13:59.506 --> 14:00.974
Good.

14:01.008 --> 14:03.977
(phone buzzes)

14:04.011 --> 14:05.478
Pardon me,
it's one of my employees.

14:05.512 --> 14:08.248
Yes?
(clears throat)

14:08.281 --> 14:10.317
JAMES: We're walking
to the tunnel now.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.052
I ditched the car

14:12.085 --> 14:13.253
a couple miles out in case
they set up a perimeter.

14:13.286 --> 14:15.222
But I'm losing cell signal.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.390
Well, let me know
when that's taken care of.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.228
We should pick up the pace.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.663
There's a lot of trouble
we could face out here.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.999
Border Patrol,
militiamen, coyotes,

14:26.033 --> 14:27.100
real coyotes.

14:27.134 --> 14:28.701
(suspenseful music)

14:28.735 --> 14:30.870
JAMES: There it is.
It looks deserted.

14:30.904 --> 14:33.540
*

14:33.573 --> 14:34.574
-Tunnel?
-Yeah.

14:34.607 --> 14:35.675
It's under the van.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.110
Is it active?

14:37.144 --> 14:38.111
There's only one way
to find out.

14:38.145 --> 14:45.152
*

14:50.390 --> 14:51.959
(grunts)

14:57.430 --> 14:58.765
All right.

15:02.970 --> 15:05.538
I'll wait for you here.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.407
No, come.

15:10.143 --> 15:13.113
(brooding suspense music)

15:13.146 --> 15:20.153
*

15:22.990 --> 15:25.158
(rustling)

15:32.432 --> 15:35.468
(muffled men's laughter)

15:38.305 --> 15:40.173
(indistinct talking)

15:40.207 --> 15:43.176
(suspenseful music)

15:43.210 --> 15:50.017
*

15:51.018 --> 15:52.485
(wind whooshing)

15:52.519 --> 15:54.921
(metal creaking)

15:54.954 --> 15:56.956
(metal clanks)

15:56.990 --> 15:59.993
(men shouting indistinctly)

16:04.697 --> 16:06.133
(clanks metal)

16:06.166 --> 16:07.867
(indistinct chatter)

16:07.900 --> 16:09.336
(grunting)

16:09.369 --> 16:10.603
Alto.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.172
(gun fires)

16:12.205 --> 16:15.308
(gunshots)

16:15.342 --> 16:18.978
(dramatic suspense music)

16:24.317 --> 16:26.453
(dramatic suspense music)

16:26.486 --> 16:32.359
*

16:32.392 --> 16:35.495
(indistinct talking)

16:37.197 --> 16:38.865
They're not just cartel guys.

16:38.898 --> 16:40.333
How do you know that?

16:40.367 --> 16:42.001
That search,

16:42.035 --> 16:43.836
it's sharp and efficient.

16:43.870 --> 16:46.639
And their weapons
are military issue.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.175
Epifanio has the Mexican army
working for him.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.210
(screams)

16:50.243 --> 16:52.179
(pained yelping)

16:54.181 --> 16:55.715
(pained groans)

16:55.748 --> 16:57.016
Shh. Keep your voice down.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.551
Just take deep breaths.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.053
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be fine.

17:00.087 --> 17:01.821
I'm gonna splint your leg.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.823
I don't want
the poison to spread.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.158
All right.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.726
(breathing heavily)
Okay.

17:06.759 --> 17:09.129
How do you know this?

17:10.363 --> 17:12.165
It's military.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.666
I had combat first-aid training.

17:13.700 --> 17:17.003
(breathing heavily)
(grunts)

17:17.036 --> 17:20.340
(soft suspense music)

17:20.373 --> 17:23.343
*

17:23.376 --> 17:24.777
We need to get you to the car.

17:24.811 --> 17:26.713
Get up.
Put your arm around me. Come on.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.381
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.

17:28.415 --> 17:30.783
I have an important meeting.
I can't leave.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.519
All right.
Bye.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.354
All right,
I'll talk to you later.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.388
All right.
Bye.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.726
I am so sorry.

17:39.759 --> 17:42.362
My wife was not happy
I cancelled lunch.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.530
Please, have a seat.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.031
Thank you for meeting with us.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.467
Well, when I heard
the, uh, DEA

17:47.500 --> 17:48.601
was joining the investigation

17:48.635 --> 17:50.203
into Teo's suicide--

17:50.237 --> 17:52.305
Cause of death is
yet to be determined.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.774
Well, I don't

17:54.807 --> 17:56.476
mean to speak ill of the dead,

17:56.509 --> 17:58.545
but Teo was screwing the help.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.780
Jailbait, no less.

18:00.813 --> 18:02.215
Tell you that himself?

18:02.249 --> 18:03.716
Teo asked for my advice.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.585
I told him
get his house in order.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.420
That boy was a hot mess.

18:07.454 --> 18:08.655
I mean, I'm not surprised
that he decided

18:08.688 --> 18:10.957
it was time to meet his maker.

18:10.990 --> 18:12.759
What can you tell us about
his work for Camila Vargas?

18:12.792 --> 18:15.762
Well, I was concerned,
given Teo's lack of judgment

18:15.795 --> 18:18.731
and Epifanio Vargas' reputation,

18:18.765 --> 18:21.434
that something may have been
done to jeopardize my firm.

18:21.468 --> 18:24.637
By "something," you mean one of
your attorneys facilitating

18:24.671 --> 18:27.407
the sale and distribution
of illegal substances?

18:27.440 --> 18:29.142
Camila Vargas,
as far as I know,

18:29.176 --> 18:31.178
is an upstanding businesswoman.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.446
Then you won't mind if we
take a look at her files.

18:33.480 --> 18:37.184
(exhales) You--you'd
need a warrant for that.

18:37.217 --> 18:40.253
But in light of Teo's passing,

18:40.287 --> 18:43.190
I'd like to be transparent
with your agency.

18:43.223 --> 18:46.293
Here are the files
for your review.

18:46.326 --> 18:47.760
Ready to roll.

18:47.794 --> 18:50.330
Like you read my mind.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.599
Well, if there's nothing else,
I have a meeting in five.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.267
Sir,

18:54.301 --> 18:55.468
I appreciate your help.

18:55.502 --> 18:56.669
Anything for the government.

18:56.703 --> 18:59.639
(soft suspenseful music)

18:59.672 --> 19:06.446
*

19:06.479 --> 19:08.448
Oh, damn it.

19:08.481 --> 19:09.716
Still no service.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.384
You should just leave me behind

19:11.418 --> 19:12.785
and get back to the truck.

19:12.819 --> 19:16.189
No, I can't leave you.

19:16.223 --> 19:18.225
You're burning up.

19:18.258 --> 19:19.326
I really need to lay down.

19:19.359 --> 19:22.762
(both grunting softly)

19:24.497 --> 19:26.466
Drink something.
Drink.

19:26.499 --> 19:27.900
I'm out of water.

19:32.205 --> 19:33.873
Shit.

19:48.621 --> 19:49.656
Squeeze it.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.658
(sucking)

19:51.691 --> 19:54.427
(engine rumbling approaches)

19:54.461 --> 19:55.495
Stay down.
Don't move.

19:55.528 --> 19:59.299
(engine revving)

20:01.601 --> 20:03.870
We've gotta keep moving.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.678
Why am I here?

20:11.711 --> 20:14.847
Camila asked us
to find the tunnel, remember?

20:14.881 --> 20:16.015
(engine revving)

20:16.048 --> 20:17.550
Shit.

20:17.584 --> 20:20.520
(dramatic music)

20:20.553 --> 20:26.058
*

20:26.092 --> 20:28.528
We're running out
of options here.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.563
The truck is
just over that ridge.

20:30.597 --> 20:32.198
Drive until you
get cell service.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.867
TERESA: Okay.

20:34.901 --> 20:35.868
You're gonna make it.
Say it.

20:35.902 --> 20:36.803
I'm gonna make it.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.204
What are you doing?

20:38.237 --> 20:39.706
-Giving you a head start.
-What?

20:39.739 --> 20:41.574
James, no.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.776
(gun firing)

20:43.810 --> 20:45.745
(bullets ricocheting)

20:45.778 --> 20:46.913
(gun firing)

20:46.946 --> 20:48.781
(intense dramatic music)

20:48.815 --> 20:50.550
(brakes squeal)

20:50.583 --> 20:52.285
MAN: Drop your weapon!
Drop it!

20:52.319 --> 20:53.320
Put the gun down!

20:53.353 --> 20:54.654
Hands behind your head!

20:54.687 --> 20:58.257
(suspenseful music)

20:58.291 --> 20:59.892
Where's the girl
who was with you?

20:59.926 --> 21:02.094
What girl?

21:04.196 --> 21:05.965
(Taser clicks)

21:05.998 --> 21:08.435
*

21:13.272 --> 21:16.075
(distant indistinct talking)

21:16.108 --> 21:18.144
(voice echoing)
Hey.

21:18.177 --> 21:20.012
Wake up, asshole.

21:20.046 --> 21:22.081
(strained breathing)

21:22.114 --> 21:25.084
(soft tense music)

21:25.117 --> 21:26.586
(soft grunt)

21:26.619 --> 21:31.424
*

21:31.458 --> 21:33.926
David Lee Autrey?

21:33.960 --> 21:35.762
My ass.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.997
You're just some pinche puto.

21:38.030 --> 21:40.299
Is that what they call you
down in Mexico?

21:40.333 --> 21:41.968
Who the hell are you?

21:42.001 --> 21:44.036
You're in the custody
of the Texas Patriot Squad,

21:44.070 --> 21:45.772
civilian militia,

21:45.805 --> 21:48.207
protecting our
freedom and borders.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.709
You shot at me and my men.

21:49.742 --> 21:51.878
So tell me why
I shouldn't put a bullet...

21:51.911 --> 21:53.480
(gun cocks)
in your head right now?

21:53.513 --> 21:55.548
*

21:55.582 --> 21:58.284
(erratic ambient music)

21:58.317 --> 22:00.453
(breathing heavily)

22:00.487 --> 22:06.993
*

22:12.331 --> 22:14.567
(exhales)

22:14.601 --> 22:16.403
Miss Mendoza.

22:16.436 --> 22:19.138
You followed me here?

22:19.171 --> 22:21.140
You didn't think we'd
let you go just like that?

22:21.173 --> 22:23.042
(brooding music)

22:23.075 --> 22:25.311
What happened to you there?

22:25.344 --> 22:27.814
*

22:27.847 --> 22:28.881
(inhales sharply)

22:28.915 --> 22:29.882
Oh.

22:29.916 --> 22:30.917
Nasty bite.

22:32.885 --> 22:35.354
Main road's just up ahead.

22:35.388 --> 22:37.524
Let me get you to a hospital.

22:37.557 --> 22:41.227
I'm so tired.

22:41.260 --> 22:43.863
Like I said, you're a
good person in a bad situation.

22:43.896 --> 22:46.098
Come with me, this all ends.

22:46.132 --> 22:48.401
Take my hand.

22:48.435 --> 22:50.770
(dramatic music pounds)

22:50.803 --> 22:52.238
(snake hissing, rattling)

22:52.271 --> 22:53.873
(panicked breathing)

22:53.906 --> 22:55.207
(thud echoes)

22:55.241 --> 22:58.377
(breathing heavily)

22:58.411 --> 23:00.413
Snakes eat rats.

23:00.447 --> 23:02.381
Only you can save yourself.

23:02.415 --> 23:04.451
Get in the truck, Teresa.

23:05.718 --> 23:08.921
(intense electronic music)

23:08.955 --> 23:14.927
*

23:14.961 --> 23:17.430
(engine turns over)

23:18.164 --> 23:20.032
Those ridiculous drones,

23:20.066 --> 23:21.868
why wasn't I told about them?

23:21.901 --> 23:23.436
Forgive me, Governor,
but I didn't

23:23.470 --> 23:25.404
want to bother you
with the technical details.

23:25.438 --> 23:26.906
You're spying on me.

23:26.939 --> 23:28.908
Everything we do
is for your protection.

23:30.076 --> 23:33.045
But if the drones displease you,

23:33.079 --> 23:34.914
I'll stop deploying them
immediately.

23:36.949 --> 23:38.985
Can they move cargo?

23:39.018 --> 23:40.753
We'd have to get bigger drones.

23:42.655 --> 23:43.823
If they can work as spies,

23:43.856 --> 23:45.825
they can also work as mules.

23:45.858 --> 23:47.460
An inspired idea.

23:47.494 --> 23:48.728
I'll look into it.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.730
(phone buzzes)

23:50.763 --> 23:51.898
¿Bueno?

23:51.931 --> 23:53.733
(soft dramatic music)

23:53.766 --> 23:54.934
Gracias, Comandante.

23:54.967 --> 23:58.237
(speaking Spanish)

23:58.270 --> 24:00.573
What's wrong?

24:00.607 --> 24:03.409
It appears we have
a breach at the tunnel.

24:03.442 --> 24:04.611
Why are you still standing here?
Go.

24:04.644 --> 24:08.447
*

24:08.481 --> 24:11.417
(throbbing suspense music)

24:11.450 --> 24:17.690
*

24:17.724 --> 24:21.127
You were in the service, right?

24:21.160 --> 24:23.630
27th Engineer Battalion
out of Fort Bragg.

24:24.964 --> 24:27.500
I was 1st Cav.

24:27.534 --> 24:29.669
Help a soldier out
and untie me.

24:32.404 --> 24:34.774
I'm a US citizen
and a vet.

24:34.807 --> 24:37.143
You know what I think?

24:37.176 --> 24:38.711
You're a coyote.

24:38.745 --> 24:39.946
Am I right?

24:39.979 --> 24:41.814
And that girl you were with,

24:41.848 --> 24:43.382
you sex-trafficking her?

24:43.415 --> 24:46.619
Hey!
Did you drug that girl?

24:46.653 --> 24:48.054
Is she out there dying?

24:48.087 --> 24:49.522
-Huh?
CARL: Hey!

24:49.556 --> 24:51.524
What are you doing?

24:51.558 --> 24:53.492
I told you
to call Border Patrol.

24:53.526 --> 24:55.361
He shot at us, Carl.

24:55.394 --> 24:57.029
And he's smuggling women
into the country.

24:57.063 --> 24:58.665
Did he confess to that?

24:58.698 --> 25:00.299
No, says he's ex-army.

25:00.332 --> 25:02.769
I say he's a lying sack of shit.

25:04.170 --> 25:06.238
(dogs barking)

25:06.272 --> 25:07.406
(engine rumbling approaches)

25:07.439 --> 25:08.507
MAN: Stop that car!

25:08.541 --> 25:11.377
(dog barking)

25:11.410 --> 25:12.511
(gun cocks)

25:12.545 --> 25:15.347
(tense music)

25:15.381 --> 25:19.385
(breathing heavily)

25:19.418 --> 25:22.855
*

25:27.126 --> 25:28.661
(breathing heavily)

25:28.695 --> 25:30.096
Get out of the truck.

25:30.129 --> 25:32.398
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.037
I need to speak
to who's in charge.

25:38.070 --> 25:40.072
-Please?
-You looking for your coyote?

25:40.106 --> 25:41.440
-That's enough, Pete.
-(indistinct)

25:41.473 --> 25:44.043
That's enough.

25:44.076 --> 25:45.712
Let's just get her to the tent.

25:45.745 --> 25:47.714
Anything happens to
this woman in our camp,

25:47.747 --> 25:49.048
the Feds will
shut us down for good.

25:49.081 --> 25:50.617
-Stand down.
-(grunts)

25:50.650 --> 25:52.118
(liquid pours)

26:01.327 --> 26:02.762
That's a serious mustache.

26:02.795 --> 26:05.197
He's very intimidating.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.900
I choose to surround myself
with strong people.

26:07.934 --> 26:09.068
Hm.

26:09.101 --> 26:11.804
You backed down the DEA.

26:11.838 --> 26:13.940
You mitigated
my risk with Teo.

26:13.973 --> 26:16.308
These kind of favors
don't come for free.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.712
Well, you pay my firm
a hefty commission.

26:19.746 --> 26:21.781
-Oh, yes, I know.
-Hm.

26:21.814 --> 26:24.283
You're one of
the richest men in Texas.

26:24.316 --> 26:26.886
It isn't cash you're after.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.420
What do you want from me?

26:34.126 --> 26:35.795
My family

26:35.828 --> 26:37.496
made their money in oil.

26:37.529 --> 26:41.433
We moved in the highest
society circles in Texas

26:41.467 --> 26:42.902
and wanted for nothing.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.904
(soft dramatic music)

26:44.937 --> 26:48.741
But the day it ran out,

26:48.775 --> 26:51.243
it took some time for my dad

26:51.277 --> 26:54.814
to drink and gamble his way
through the assets we had left.

26:54.847 --> 26:56.248
He ended up dying

26:56.282 --> 26:57.784
destitute on the street.

26:57.817 --> 27:00.286
(swallows)

27:00.319 --> 27:04.991
So I cultivated
the friendships of my youth.

27:05.024 --> 27:07.660
I may not have had much,

27:07.694 --> 27:11.197
but I had powerful friends
and plenty of them.

27:11.230 --> 27:14.100
And eventually,
I was back on top.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.268
The difference was

27:16.302 --> 27:18.705
there's no way in hell

27:18.738 --> 27:22.041
I'm ever gonna let anyone
take that away from me again.

27:22.074 --> 27:24.176
*

27:24.210 --> 27:26.378
To powerful friends.

27:26.412 --> 27:27.680
(glasses clink)

27:30.983 --> 27:33.052
You got some real bad luck here.

27:33.085 --> 27:35.855
(pained groan)

27:35.888 --> 27:38.791
We usually don't see
bark scorpions around here.

27:38.825 --> 27:40.960
That antihistamine
should be kicking in.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.128
How are you feeling?

27:42.161 --> 27:44.697
Better.
Thank you.

27:44.731 --> 27:45.998
Where's my friend?

27:48.701 --> 27:50.336
"Friend"

27:50.369 --> 27:52.238
gives you fake passports?

27:55.842 --> 27:57.309
When you're up and walking,

27:57.343 --> 27:58.878
I'm gonna have to
call Border Patrol,

27:58.911 --> 28:00.146
turn you in to custody.

28:00.179 --> 28:01.881
(soft brooding music)

28:01.914 --> 28:05.017
You started this group
to protect your county?

28:05.051 --> 28:06.252
Something like that.

28:06.285 --> 28:09.088
We have a common enemy.

28:09.121 --> 28:11.891
(soft chuckle)

28:11.924 --> 28:14.493
That's hard to believe, honey.

28:14.526 --> 28:15.594
I used to work for a cartel.

28:15.627 --> 28:17.329
They forced me to be a mule.

28:17.363 --> 28:18.831
When I tried to escape,

28:18.865 --> 28:20.232
they killed my entire family.

28:20.266 --> 28:21.367
*

28:21.400 --> 28:23.836
We can help each other.

28:23.870 --> 28:25.404
You got my attention.
Go on.

28:25.437 --> 28:27.673
There's a tunnel at the border.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.041
That's why we're here.

28:29.075 --> 28:31.710
We were doing surveillance.

28:31.744 --> 28:33.279
I can take you there right now.

28:33.312 --> 28:36.282
*

28:36.315 --> 28:38.851
You can tell the Border Patrol
all about the tunnel.

28:38.885 --> 28:41.087
You know the cartels
control everyone,

28:41.120 --> 28:43.890
even the Border Patrol.

28:43.923 --> 28:45.925
There's another way.

28:45.958 --> 28:48.260
This whole country's
getting soft.

28:48.294 --> 28:49.796
You can barely touch a girl

28:49.829 --> 28:51.463
without some feminazi

28:51.497 --> 28:54.100
whining about harassment.

28:54.133 --> 28:55.567
Now I got Carl giving me crap

28:55.601 --> 28:57.103
about manhandling some bitch.

28:57.136 --> 28:59.238
Yeah, what bitch would that be?

29:00.907 --> 29:03.309
Your piece of ass.

29:03.342 --> 29:05.277
She got mouthy, and
I was just about to shut her up.

29:05.311 --> 29:06.813
You think that
makes you a tough guy,

29:06.846 --> 29:08.114
putting your hands on women?

29:08.147 --> 29:09.982
You're just a fucking coward.

29:10.016 --> 29:11.550
(brooding music)

29:11.583 --> 29:12.751
What'd you say to me?

29:12.785 --> 29:13.820
-(blow lands)
-(grunts)

29:13.853 --> 29:15.654
*

29:15.687 --> 29:17.223
Oh, you're dead, bitch.

29:17.256 --> 29:18.958
Pete!
Knock it off!

29:18.991 --> 29:20.392
Knock it off!
God damn it!

29:20.426 --> 29:23.062
Back off!

29:23.095 --> 29:24.897
Cut him loose.

29:24.931 --> 29:27.233
Now.

29:27.266 --> 29:28.935
What's going on, Carl?

29:28.968 --> 29:31.670
Cut him loose right now.

29:31.703 --> 29:34.406
(tense music)

29:34.440 --> 29:38.477
*

29:38.510 --> 29:39.511
Hey, hey, hey!

29:39.545 --> 29:40.847
Back off, back off.

29:40.880 --> 29:43.149
Just cool it.
Move it!

29:43.182 --> 29:45.417
*

29:45.451 --> 29:47.153
-Are you okay?
-I thought I told you to go.

29:47.186 --> 29:49.121
I'm not leaving you.
Come on.

29:49.155 --> 29:51.323
-How the hell did you find me?
-Followed the tire tracks.

29:51.357 --> 29:53.125
You needed an army?
I got us one.

29:53.159 --> 29:55.962
TERESA: The tunnel is under
the van on the left.

29:55.995 --> 29:58.697
Damn.
You weren't lying.

29:58.730 --> 30:00.766
Coke comes from Mexico
through the tunnel

30:00.799 --> 30:02.434
and then the vans
take it to Dallas.

30:02.468 --> 30:06.638
God damn.
Not gonna happen today.

30:06.672 --> 30:08.207
We have explosives.

30:09.976 --> 30:11.643
If you're thinking
what I'm thinking, darling,

30:11.677 --> 30:12.711
I love the way you think.

30:12.744 --> 30:14.713
Let's blow up the tunnel.

30:14.746 --> 30:16.215
You need papers?

30:16.248 --> 30:17.516
'Cause I'm single.

30:17.549 --> 30:19.118
Oh, Jesus Christ.

30:19.151 --> 30:20.887
CARL: Hey, vans are moving.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.488
Pete, you, me, and the boys
will stop the vans.

30:22.521 --> 30:24.190
Teresa, you get to
blow up the tunnel.

30:24.223 --> 30:27.026
(dramatic music)

30:27.059 --> 30:34.066
*

30:40.206 --> 30:42.141
(engine revving)

30:42.174 --> 30:45.811
(engine roars)

30:45.844 --> 30:47.947
Chingada.
Los siguien.

30:49.681 --> 30:52.084
(indistinct shouting)

30:52.118 --> 30:54.353
(shouting Spanish)

31:03.629 --> 31:04.596
We're almost at the tunnel.

31:04.630 --> 31:06.265
Get the bomb ready.

31:06.298 --> 31:07.599
(switch clicks)

31:07.633 --> 31:09.035
It's armed.

31:11.270 --> 31:13.105

31:18.144 --> 31:19.545

31:36.128 --> 31:37.129
(tires screech)

31:37.163 --> 31:39.498
(brakes squeal)

31:41.800 --> 31:43.535
Get out of the van!

31:43.569 --> 31:44.803
Get out of the van, asshole!

31:44.836 --> 31:46.905
Get out of the van.

32:53.172 --> 32:56.108

32:56.142 --> 32:58.277
WOMAN: 911,
what's your emergency?

32:58.310 --> 33:00.612
Hey, yeah, yo,
they just shot a cop.

33:00.646 --> 33:02.548
Some dude with an AK,
he just shot a cop.

33:02.581 --> 33:03.782
He's running around crazy,
pointing the gun at everybody.

33:03.815 --> 33:04.850
WOMAN: What's your location?

33:04.883 --> 33:06.552
It's, uh, Walnut Hill.

33:06.585 --> 33:08.454
Next to the, uh,
you know the Black Star Liquor?

33:08.487 --> 33:10.022
WOMAN: We're sending
someone now.

33:10.056 --> 33:11.190
Yeah, yeah, hurry.
This guy, he--he's nuts.

33:12.991 --> 33:14.860

MAN: All units be advised.

33:14.893 --> 33:16.295
Officer down and shooter on foot

33:16.328 --> 33:17.396
in vicinity of Black Star Liquor

33:17.429 --> 33:18.997

33:19.031 --> 33:20.866
Shit.
That's right around the corner.

33:20.899 --> 33:22.301
We should respond.
(engine turns over)

33:22.334 --> 33:23.802
We can't leave our post.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.471
An officer is down.

33:25.504 --> 33:26.872

I'll call someone to cover.

33:35.181 --> 33:36.648
Nothing here, man.

33:36.682 --> 33:38.517
Van Awken's either straight

33:38.550 --> 33:40.652
or he's smart enough to clean
Teo's mess after him.

33:40.686 --> 33:42.421
(cell phone rings)

33:42.454 --> 33:45.557
It's death by a thousand
paper cuts and he knows it.

33:45.591 --> 33:48.927
(cell phone ringing)

33:48.960 --> 33:52.364
Finnerman.

33:52.398 --> 33:54.433
Shooting.
Where?

33:54.466 --> 33:57.869
No, you get your ass
back to that motel now.

Shit!

34:16.588 --> 34:18.023

34:18.056 --> 34:20.359
Postak and Felix
just lost eyes on Guero.

34:20.392 --> 34:22.894

34:22.928 --> 34:24.763
Weaselly prick.

34:24.796 --> 34:26.765
One guess
who he's going to see.

34:26.798 --> 34:29.701
(sighs)

34:29.735 --> 34:31.703
(tsks) Can't say I blame him.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.205
GUERO: Just don't
make a decision

34:33.239 --> 34:34.873
about the DEA
till we talk, okay?

34:34.906 --> 34:38.144
Please?
I love you.

34:38.177 --> 34:39.077
(beeps)

34:44.483 --> 34:46.285
How's the leg?

34:46.318 --> 34:48.787
I'll survive.

34:48.820 --> 34:50.556
Good.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.057
Carl gave me his number.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.226
Should I call him?

34:54.260 --> 34:55.394
Eh.

34:55.427 --> 34:56.395
I'd hold off.

34:56.428 --> 34:58.730
Play hard to get.

34:58.764 --> 35:01.400
(tender music)

35:01.433 --> 35:02.901
Look, you shouldn't have
come back for me.

35:02.934 --> 35:06.772
It was stupid.
You could have been killed.

35:06.805 --> 35:09.308
But you didn't leave me behind,
and I won't forget it.

35:09.341 --> 35:16.348
*

35:19.050 --> 35:21.420
-Gracias.
(indistinct chatter)

35:21.453 --> 35:24.423
(delicate music playing)

35:24.456 --> 35:27.793

35:27.826 --> 35:29.428
Keep an eye on that
little hurricane.

35:29.461 --> 35:32.130
Two drinks maximum.

35:32.164 --> 35:33.199
Hola.
¿Como estás?

35:33.232 --> 35:34.200
¿Como estás?

35:34.233 --> 35:36.101
Hola.
Bien.

35:36.134 --> 35:40.372
*

35:40.406 --> 35:42.308
Hola.

35:48.013 --> 35:49.981
The tunnel's gone.

35:50.015 --> 35:52.784
An explosion.
We lost three men.

35:52.818 --> 35:55.120
I don't care about your men.
Who did it?

35:55.153 --> 35:56.188
(tense music)

35:56.222 --> 35:57.689
We captured this image

35:57.723 --> 35:59.891
off of one of
the surveillance drones.

35:59.925 --> 36:00.892
Teresa.

36:00.926 --> 36:02.461
That's unacceptable.

36:02.494 --> 36:05.331
They are making me
look like a fool.

36:05.364 --> 36:06.865
You assured me that
Don Reynaldo's product

36:06.898 --> 36:08.967
would be protected.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.902
Now, you had one job, Colonel,

36:10.936 --> 36:12.070
and you failed miserably.

36:12.103 --> 36:15.040
(clapping)

36:15.073 --> 36:17.175
(applause)

36:18.910 --> 36:21.980
*

36:22.013 --> 36:24.750
Your daughter looks beautiful.

36:24.783 --> 36:28.220
Moctezuma had a daughter
with the name Isabela.

36:28.254 --> 36:30.589
When her father was killed,

36:30.622 --> 36:32.023
Cortés, the conquistador,

36:32.057 --> 36:34.159
took her in as his own
and gave her

36:34.192 --> 36:36.562
a land,

36:36.595 --> 36:39.265
a new religion,
a new name.

36:39.298 --> 36:41.867
Who exactly do you think
you're talking to?

36:41.900 --> 36:45.837
Do you think you are
the only killer in this place?

36:45.871 --> 36:48.274
If you say my daughter's
name again,

36:48.307 --> 36:51.577
I will carve it into your skull.

36:51.610 --> 36:54.380
Now,

36:54.413 --> 36:57.716
go and fix your mess.

36:57.749 --> 36:59.017
(indistinct chatter)

36:59.050 --> 37:01.287
Please.

37:01.320 --> 37:04.256
Bela, you look wonderful.

37:06.258 --> 37:08.860
That dress and those shoes,

37:08.894 --> 37:10.729
aren't they
a little too grown-up?

37:10.762 --> 37:12.197
Mom sent me the shoes

37:12.230 --> 37:14.566
and I love them.

37:14.600 --> 37:15.567
More than the pearls?

37:15.601 --> 37:17.135
I love the pearls.

37:17.168 --> 37:18.370
This isn't a competition, papi.

37:18.404 --> 37:20.272
Okay.

37:20.306 --> 37:21.807
A toast to my daughter!

37:21.840 --> 37:24.476
I love you more
than life itself.

37:24.510 --> 37:25.411
Happy birthday...
(kisses)

37:25.444 --> 37:26.878
mi'ja.

37:26.912 --> 37:29.715
Feliz cumpleaños.

37:29.748 --> 37:31.650
ALL: Feliz cumpleaños.

(brooding electronic music)

37:36.955 --> 37:39.758

37:54.840 --> 37:56.842
I asked Pote
to look at your car

37:56.875 --> 37:59.277
to see why it was overheating.

37:59.311 --> 38:02.448
(suspenseful music)

38:02.481 --> 38:05.784
*

38:05.817 --> 38:09.655
See, if you're going to
represent this business,

38:09.688 --> 38:12.591
you should be driving something
more...

38:12.624 --> 38:13.792
reliable.

38:16.127 --> 38:17.363
(clicks)

38:18.330 --> 38:20.666
Come.

38:20.699 --> 38:27.473
*

38:28.474 --> 38:31.042
I purchased it for Isabela.

38:33.011 --> 38:36.147
I don't think I'm gonna be
seeing my daughter anytime soon.

38:38.350 --> 38:40.151
I'm sorry.

38:40.185 --> 38:41.487
It's temporary.

38:43.221 --> 38:46.625
I was impressed
with what you did today.

38:46.658 --> 38:48.660
You manipulated
a pack of rabid dogs

38:48.694 --> 38:50.161
into doing our bidding.

38:51.430 --> 38:54.332
This car

38:54.366 --> 38:56.368
is a symbol of my trust.

38:56.402 --> 38:59.204
(gentle music)

38:59.237 --> 39:06.177
*

39:07.513 --> 39:09.448
I'm giving you your freedom.

39:11.450 --> 39:12.918
Don't make me regret it.

39:37.409 --> 39:40.912
I checked the car
for GPS trackers.

39:40.946 --> 39:42.213
It's clean,

39:42.247 --> 39:43.649
for now.

39:46.284 --> 39:48.353
There's an old saying.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.522
The fish only sees the bait,

39:50.556 --> 39:51.857
never the hook.

39:51.890 --> 39:54.125
I know you lied to me about

39:54.159 --> 39:56.528
your car overheating, Teresita.

39:56.562 --> 39:58.464
Whatever you're hiding

39:58.497 --> 40:01.132
better be worth it.

40:04.603 --> 40:07.573

(engine turns over)

40:10.909 --> 40:17.916
*

40:25.524 --> 40:27.759
Wasn't quite sure if you'd show.

40:32.330 --> 40:34.900
I won't turn on Camila.

40:34.933 --> 40:36.835
(pensive music)

40:36.868 --> 40:39.304
All right, then screw it.

40:39.337 --> 40:41.773
Screw 'em all, let's just
get the hell out of here.

40:41.807 --> 40:45.611
I'm not gonna run away with you.

40:45.644 --> 40:47.479
One day we'll
be sitting on a beach

40:47.513 --> 40:49.414
and someone's gonna
walk up to us

40:49.447 --> 40:52.751
and gonna put two bullets
into our heads.

40:52.784 --> 40:55.754
We can't run anymore.

40:55.787 --> 40:59.190
You know that.

40:59.224 --> 41:02.794
So what now?

41:02.828 --> 41:06.698
Everything in our life
was always on your terms.

41:06.732 --> 41:08.634
That's over now.

41:09.968 --> 41:11.803
If you want to be with me,

41:11.837 --> 41:14.506
you need to prove
you're not with the DEA.

41:14.540 --> 41:17.843
Convince Camila
you're on her side,

41:17.876 --> 41:21.680
part of her family.

41:21.713 --> 41:24.082
I had to make a choice.

41:27.052 --> 41:29.387
Now you need to make yours.
