WEBVTT

00:03.469 --> 00:06.003
Welcome back
to "gadget corner."

00:06.004 --> 00:09.273
Next, we have
an air-powered
appliance mover.

00:09.274 --> 00:12.043
This is a very useful device.
I have one of these myself.

00:12.044 --> 00:15.914
It's a way to move furniture
without scratching the floor
or hurting your back.

00:15.915 --> 00:17.615
These panels are attached
to a blower unit.

00:17.616 --> 00:20.052
Right. Marv, close in here.
I'll show you these.

00:20.053 --> 00:22.454
The air is forced into these
aluminum air beams.

00:22.455 --> 00:25.990
Which creates enough air
pressure to lift weights
of up to 700 pounds.

00:25.991 --> 00:29.928
Which is how al moves his mom
room to room.

00:29.929 --> 00:31.863
Can we just...

00:36.201 --> 00:38.403
Can we just
demonstrate this, please?

00:38.404 --> 00:42.374
You just sling the unit
over your shoulder
and turn it on...

00:42.375 --> 00:46.278
And move your refrigerator
effortlessly.

00:46.279 --> 00:48.212
Wow!
Hey!

00:52.051 --> 00:54.018
That is very useful.

00:54.019 --> 00:57.555
You can see how useful this is,
but it only will raise it
about an inch and a quarter.

00:57.556 --> 00:59.690
What happens if you have
to move it up a step?

00:59.691 --> 01:04.296
Well, then you would do it
the old-fashioned way -
by the sweat of your brow.

01:04.297 --> 01:06.297
Let me show you
how I'll do it.

01:06.298 --> 01:09.167
Heidi, my slightly tweaked
furniture mover, please.

01:12.872 --> 01:15.140
Here you go, tim.
Thank you, heidi.

01:15.141 --> 01:17.441
With the few modifications
I've made on this,

01:17.442 --> 01:21.612
I'll now be able
to lift that thing
about a foot and a half.

01:21.613 --> 01:23.948
Help me out here.

01:23.949 --> 01:26.151
All right.
Thank you, heidi.

01:26.152 --> 01:28.419
Just... Oh.

01:28.420 --> 01:31.022
Switch her on.
There you go. Lifts it...

01:31.023 --> 01:32.624
Oh!

01:32.625 --> 01:33.958
Unh!

02:33.452 --> 02:35.486
Hey, brad,
guess what I got.

02:35.487 --> 02:37.789
The girls'
best and worst list.

02:37.790 --> 02:41.059
I can't believe you got that.
What is it?

02:41.060 --> 02:43.094
The girls in high school
pass around this list

02:43.095 --> 02:47.399
That says what they like
about guys, like best hair,
best eyes, best personality.

02:47.400 --> 02:50.201
And guess who
has best butt.

02:53.672 --> 02:55.173
No way. Let me see.

02:55.174 --> 02:57.008
Look all you want.

02:59.478 --> 03:02.613
Not your butt, idiot.
The list.

03:05.251 --> 03:07.352
I can't believe
I'm not on here.

03:07.353 --> 03:09.487
How could I lose
"best eyebrows"
to joey pagoonis?

03:09.488 --> 03:11.455
He only has one.

03:15.060 --> 03:17.161
Hi, guys.
Hi, mom.

03:20.532 --> 03:22.467
Why are you
standing like that?

03:22.468 --> 03:25.603
Just appreciating
a work of art.

03:28.541 --> 03:31.409
Do you think the kids
are getting weirder?

03:31.410 --> 03:35.347
They've moved way past weird.
They're into that
frightening category now.

03:35.348 --> 03:38.116
Wait till I tell you
about what I found out
at school today.

03:38.117 --> 03:40.218
You know my friend patty?

03:40.219 --> 03:42.820
That woman you like
'cause she's older
than you?

03:42.821 --> 03:46.157
Yeah. Get a load of this.
She's pregnant.

03:46.158 --> 03:48.059
That's great.

03:48.060 --> 03:50.594
Patty doesn't think so.
She's 43 years old.

03:50.595 --> 03:53.398
She's got teenagers.
She was so thrilled
to be back at school,

03:53.399 --> 03:55.533
And now everything's
gonna change.

03:55.534 --> 03:57.535
Well, maybe patty
and mr. Patty

03:57.536 --> 04:00.371
Should have used
some precautions.

04:00.372 --> 04:05.043
They were using precautions.
The same kind we use.

04:05.044 --> 04:06.711
<i>(grunts)</i> oh, no.

04:08.481 --> 04:11.716
I wouldn't want to find
myself in that boat.

04:11.717 --> 04:13.952
I wouldn't want to find
myself in that harbor.

04:16.856 --> 04:19.624
Tim... We're pretty much
in agreement

04:19.625 --> 04:22.994
That our family
is complete, right?

04:22.995 --> 04:25.897
No more
frightening weirdoes.

04:25.898 --> 04:28.500
Are you sure?
Positive.

04:28.501 --> 04:32.504
Maybe we should think about
some more definitive action,
something permanent.

04:32.505 --> 04:36.641
Separate bedrooms?
Tim...

04:36.642 --> 04:40.345
That's great. You want
a more permanent solution,
you have my total support.

04:40.346 --> 04:44.582
Honey, I'm talking about
you getting a vasectomy.

04:45.751 --> 04:47.385
You... You...

04:47.386 --> 04:49.754
You've lost my support.

04:51.023 --> 04:53.157
I thought you meant
the tube-tying thing.

04:53.158 --> 04:57.762
Well, I am talking about
the tube-tying thing,
except it's your tubes.

04:57.763 --> 05:01.533
You can back up
that clip ship right now.

05:01.534 --> 05:04.935
Honey, it is much safer
for a man to get a vasectomy

05:04.936 --> 05:07.538
Than it is for a woman
to have a tubal ligation.

05:07.539 --> 05:09.741
Says who, the wives
with knives club?

05:14.413 --> 05:17.382
Look, if I do this,
I have to check into
the hospital,

05:17.383 --> 05:20.150
Go under general anesthetic
and have surgery.

05:20.151 --> 05:22.553
But a man has
a vasectomy right there
in the doctor's office.

05:22.554 --> 05:24.856
It's much less invasive.

05:27.058 --> 05:30.361
Let me tell you something.
Anytime you're dealing with
the downtown area...

05:31.731 --> 05:34.832
...It's pretty darn
invasive.

05:34.833 --> 05:38.469
My gynecologist
gave me the name
of a very good urologist.

05:38.470 --> 05:41.272
Can we just go talk
to this dr. Kaplan?

05:41.273 --> 05:44.942
Why are we slamming the door
on having more kids, anyway?

05:47.479 --> 05:49.848
A minute ago, you
weren't crazy about
the ones we have.

05:49.849 --> 05:52.050
You called them
frightening weirdoes.

05:52.051 --> 05:55.754
I said it
in a very positive light.
I love those little guys.

05:55.755 --> 05:59.023
Hey, kids, get down here!
Daddy wants to tell you
how much he loves you!

06:03.696 --> 06:05.997
Hey, guys.
Hey, marty.

06:05.998 --> 06:07.999
Hey, benny.
Hey, marty.

06:09.568 --> 06:11.536
Nice sweater.

06:11.537 --> 06:14.639
Wow. That reminds me
of something -

06:14.640 --> 06:18.743
When one of the kids spit up
after eating a whole box
of crayons.

06:18.744 --> 06:21.845
That's very funny.
Yeah.

06:21.846 --> 06:25.416
Jeez, who dresses you,
your wife?

06:25.417 --> 06:28.852
She didn't dress me.
She just bought it and...

06:28.853 --> 06:31.089
Made me wear it.

06:31.090 --> 06:33.892
You are getting
very henpecked, martin.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.526
Speaking of "pecked,"

06:35.527 --> 06:40.665
I heard about your little visit
with the urologist tomorrow.

06:40.666 --> 06:43.467
Marty, that's not
public information, ok?

06:43.468 --> 06:46.003
What's the matter?
Are you sick?
No.

06:46.004 --> 06:47.071
Huh?
Mm-mmm.

06:47.072 --> 06:49.073
It's your prostate, right?

06:50.376 --> 06:53.110
Mine's as big
as a florida grapefruit.

06:55.113 --> 06:59.751
No. Jill's making tim
get a vasectomy.
Marty!

06:59.752 --> 07:02.086
A vasectomy?
Wow.

07:02.087 --> 07:04.689
Oh, my god.
Jill's getting you fixed?

07:06.325 --> 07:10.028
I'm not getting a vasectomy.
I'm just talking about it.

07:10.029 --> 07:12.029
Yeah, well, all I know is,

07:12.030 --> 07:14.465
I'd never let nancy
let me get clipped.

07:14.466 --> 07:18.202
I mean, who'd want
someone coming at you
with a set of these?

07:20.272 --> 07:22.974
That's not what they use!

07:22.975 --> 07:26.277
Then what does the vet use
to cut them off?

07:26.278 --> 07:29.581
What? You don't go to a vet.
You go to a doctor.

07:29.582 --> 07:32.150
They don't cut anything off.
They just tie something off
inside of you.

07:32.151 --> 07:34.985
I would still
never get a vasectomy.

07:34.986 --> 07:37.422
Well, why would you
need one?

07:38.691 --> 07:40.859
Al, all I know is,

07:40.860 --> 07:44.929
Once you have that happen,
you're... You're a changed man.

07:44.930 --> 07:48.166
You are not. It doesn't
change you at all.

07:48.167 --> 07:51.302
Tell that to my dog.

07:51.303 --> 07:55.372
We had boomer neutered.
He was a changed animal.

07:55.373 --> 07:59.911
All he does now is he just
runs around in circles all day
and chews on my slippers.

07:59.912 --> 08:01.246
He always did that.

08:01.247 --> 08:03.180
Yeah, but now he does it,

08:03.181 --> 08:05.817
And he's got this real sad
look on his face.

08:08.520 --> 08:10.488
I don't want
to talk about this.

08:10.489 --> 08:13.090
You'd better talk about it now
'cause after you get it done...

08:13.091 --> 08:15.092
<i>(high-pitched)</i> ...You're
gonna be talking like this.

08:20.966 --> 08:23.034
You could be
your own tool girl.

08:27.373 --> 08:29.574
That's real funny, guys.

08:29.575 --> 08:31.843
I think you're all
being very insensitive.

08:31.844 --> 08:35.446
A vasectomy is a noble way
for a man to take
responsibility.

08:35.447 --> 08:37.481
Tim is making
a very loving choice.

08:37.482 --> 08:39.850
Shut up, al.

08:39.851 --> 08:44.154
What do you do, al?
Sit on the can all day
reading <i>ladies home journal?</i>

08:45.524 --> 08:47.959
Hey, tim, pass me
the potato chips,
would ya?

08:47.960 --> 08:50.328
Do I look like
a waiter to you?

08:50.329 --> 08:52.863
Forget the chips.
Got any nuts?

09:02.407 --> 09:04.641
We should go. I don't think
the doctor's gonna be here.

09:04.642 --> 09:06.877
Honey, it's only been
about 30 seconds.

09:06.878 --> 09:09.680
Really? It seems like
a lot longer, doesn't it?

09:09.681 --> 09:12.450
<i>(woman)</i> harold,
get back here!

09:16.521 --> 09:18.923
Another happy customer.

09:18.924 --> 09:22.794
Hi, mr. And mrs. Taylor.
I'm dr. Kaplan.
I'll be with you in a minute.

09:24.697 --> 09:26.164
<i>(dr. Kaplan)</i> harold!

09:26.165 --> 09:28.433
You brought me here
to see a woman?

09:28.434 --> 09:31.135
I didn't know
she was a woman.

09:31.136 --> 09:35.639
My gynecologist
just said that dr. Kaplan
was the best urologist in town.

09:35.640 --> 09:40.278
How am I supposed
to talk to a woman about
what's going on in manland?

09:40.279 --> 09:43.614
Manland?

09:43.615 --> 09:46.150
Now you got a theme park
between your legs?

09:52.791 --> 09:56.994
Honey, you don't have to
have the surgery done
by a woman.

09:56.995 --> 10:00.398
But as long as we're here,
we might as well listen
to what she has to say.

10:00.399 --> 10:03.000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

10:04.803 --> 10:08.372
So, what brings you here today?

10:08.373 --> 10:10.741
We're interested
in a vasectomy.

10:10.742 --> 10:13.644
She's more interested
than I am.

10:13.645 --> 10:15.679
That's not uncommon.

10:15.680 --> 10:18.682
But let me assure you,
this is a very safe procedure.

10:18.683 --> 10:20.818
It's done
here in the office.

10:20.819 --> 10:24.322
And it's totally
foolproof, right?
Almost 100%.

10:24.323 --> 10:26.090
What if I change my mind?

10:26.091 --> 10:28.058
In some cases,
it can be reversed,

10:28.059 --> 10:30.294
But you shouldn't
count on that as an option.

10:30.295 --> 10:32.863
I mean change my mind
about being here,
which I think I have.

10:32.864 --> 10:34.899
Tim, tim, tim,
wait, wait, wait.

10:34.900 --> 10:37.001
Um... My husband,
I think,

10:37.002 --> 10:41.606
Is just concerned
about how this is gonna
affect his performance.

10:41.607 --> 10:43.373
Honey!

10:43.374 --> 10:46.944
Let me handle this.
You see, I put on a good show.

10:49.147 --> 10:53.918
I just want to make sure
the curtain doesn't come down
in the middle of the first act.

10:53.919 --> 10:57.855
This will not in any way
affect your sexual function.

10:57.856 --> 11:01.859
We simply cut off
the flow of sperm...
Oh, boy.

11:01.860 --> 11:04.529
...To prevent it from entering
the seminal stream.

11:04.530 --> 11:06.697
So I'm fishing
without bait now.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.701
No bait.

11:09.702 --> 11:12.302
Tell us what's involved
in the procedure.

11:12.303 --> 11:14.639
Yeah, I'm dying
to hear this.

11:14.640 --> 11:16.740
The morning
of your appointment,

11:16.741 --> 11:19.577
You'd have to
shave in the area where
I'll be making the incisions.

11:19.578 --> 11:22.113
Shave?

11:22.114 --> 11:24.015
Here?

11:24.016 --> 11:27.318
It's just a routine procedure.
Not in my house it's not.

11:29.488 --> 11:33.224
What do you think,
I wake up, brush my teeth
and shave ping and pong?

11:38.897 --> 11:40.932
Well, you could
go to a barber,

11:40.933 --> 11:43.401
But it might be
a little awkward.

11:43.402 --> 11:48.772
The first thing I do
is give you a shot
that's a local.

11:48.773 --> 11:52.376
Local, like here
in detroit?

11:52.377 --> 11:54.411
No. Local, like here
in your scrotum.

11:54.412 --> 11:56.947
Oh, boy.

11:56.948 --> 11:59.117
That does sting
for a few seconds.

11:59.118 --> 12:00.551
You think?

12:06.325 --> 12:08.158
Then I make two small cuts

12:08.159 --> 12:10.527
And simply divide
and tie up the tubes.

12:10.528 --> 12:12.563
The discomfort
is very minimal.

12:12.564 --> 12:15.165
Why don't you tell that
to the boys in the basement?

12:15.166 --> 12:17.201
You'll be back to normal
in a few days.

12:17.202 --> 12:20.104
The only restriction
is you can't drive home
that day.

12:20.105 --> 12:24.675
What? I can't drive?
Forget about it.

12:24.676 --> 12:26.843
What do you mean,
"forget about it"?

12:26.844 --> 12:29.213
Honey, honestly,
I was really into it
up till that point.

12:29.214 --> 12:31.382
The driving thing iced it.

12:31.383 --> 12:32.950
It's just one day!

12:32.951 --> 12:35.786
It's bad enough
to separate a man
from his sperm.

12:35.787 --> 12:39.323
But separate a man
from his car? That's inhuman.

12:39.324 --> 12:40.725
Harold, wait up.

13:06.218 --> 13:10.054
Aren't you getting tired
of looking at your butt?

13:10.055 --> 13:12.890
Surprisingly, no.

13:12.891 --> 13:16.160
Let me tell you something
no one's ever gonna
tell you in life.

13:16.161 --> 13:18.529
Looks matter
and... I got 'em.

13:21.833 --> 13:24.568
Just too bad
you're sitting on 'em.

13:26.905 --> 13:28.305
Hi, brad.
Hey.

13:28.306 --> 13:31.408
Seriously, aren't my eyebrows
better than joey's?

13:31.409 --> 13:33.877
Yeah. I told you
I voted for you.

13:33.878 --> 13:35.912
I can't believe
I lost to a guy

13:35.913 --> 13:38.282
With a caterpillar
over his eyes.

13:38.283 --> 13:40.117
Hey, brad, angela.
Hey, randy. How you doing?

13:40.118 --> 13:44.488
Great. You happen to
see the latest list?
I made "best butt."

13:44.489 --> 13:46.891
I heard. Allison lewis
was having a huge fight
with her boyfriend,

13:46.892 --> 13:50.862
Who has the cutest butt,
because he was talking
to tiffany fink,

13:50.863 --> 13:54.431
So she made up this list,
and instead of putting
his cute butt on it,

13:54.432 --> 13:58.502
She picked out
the scrawniest butt,
which was you.

14:00.205 --> 14:03.474
Maybe I shouldn't have
told you that.
You think?

14:03.475 --> 14:04.675
Sorry.

14:06.578 --> 14:09.280
I'm so embarrassed.
Why didn't you tell me
he didn't know?

14:09.281 --> 14:11.682
If I knew he didn't know,
I wouldn't have said anything,

14:11.683 --> 14:15.085
Because I'm usually careful
about what comes out
of my mouth.

14:16.487 --> 14:19.756
Tim, didn't you hear
one word that doctor said?

14:19.757 --> 14:21.058
Yeah, yeah!

14:21.059 --> 14:24.228
She wants to take the zip-a-dee
out of my doo-dah.

14:25.931 --> 14:29.733
Look, I know how hard
it was for you to even
talk to that doctor.

14:29.734 --> 14:31.835
But I had hoped that once
we got out of there,

14:31.836 --> 14:34.872
We could have
a rational discussion
about it.

14:34.873 --> 14:36.673
We did in the car
on the way home.

14:36.674 --> 14:38.709
All you did
all the way home

14:38.710 --> 14:40.744
Was come up with
one ridiculous excuse
after another.

14:40.745 --> 14:43.380
Not true. I merely said that,
for this sort of thing,

14:43.381 --> 14:45.516
It might be better
to wait for warmer weather.

14:47.919 --> 14:50.988
I'll knit you
a little sweater.

14:55.694 --> 14:57.761
You heard her.
Shots, shaving?

14:57.762 --> 15:00.298
You don't understand
about the pain down there.

15:00.299 --> 15:03.934
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait a minute!
<i>(turns off tv)</i>

15:03.935 --> 15:07.104
I don't understand
about the pain down there?

15:07.105 --> 15:11.942
I, who had three children
ripped from my loins...

15:11.943 --> 15:16.080
In what is laughingly described
as "natural" childbirth?

15:16.081 --> 15:18.715
Oh, boy. Here we go.

15:18.716 --> 15:23.387
The pain of childbirth.
Isn't there a statute
of limitations on this?

15:23.388 --> 15:26.691
Isn't there
a statute of limitations
on you being a bonehead?

15:26.692 --> 15:29.226
You are totally unwilling
to accept responsibility

15:29.227 --> 15:33.297
For what I have accepted
total responsibility for
since we met!

15:33.298 --> 15:35.599
This is not about
accepting responsibility.

15:35.600 --> 15:39.403
This is about me being neutered
and chewing on my slippers.

15:40.705 --> 15:43.073
Who said anything
about you being neutered?

15:43.074 --> 15:45.675
Certain experts I talked to.
Harry and benny?

15:45.676 --> 15:48.846
Where did they
get their degrees,
university of I'm an idiot?

15:48.847 --> 15:51.315
Well, they may be idiots,

15:51.316 --> 15:53.684
But they think
exactly like I do.

15:57.155 --> 16:00.891
Oh, is that you, neighbor?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:00.892 --> 16:03.494
Hi, wilson.
What are you doing?

16:03.495 --> 16:06.630
I'm gathering some twigs
for my terrarium.

16:06.631 --> 16:09.767
It's mating time
for my new spiders.

16:09.768 --> 16:12.503
You know, tim,
it's a little-known fact,

16:12.504 --> 16:14.605
But the male spider's
sex organ

16:14.606 --> 16:17.775
Is located at the end
of one of its legs.

16:17.776 --> 16:21.345
Better keep that spider
away from jill.

16:21.346 --> 16:24.047
He won't have a leg
to stand on.

16:27.886 --> 16:29.954
I'm not sure I follow.

16:29.955 --> 16:34.225
She wants, um... She wants me
to have a vasectomy.

16:34.226 --> 16:36.460
Ah, I follow.

16:36.461 --> 16:38.829
I know a lot of guys get them.
I'm not one of those guys.

16:38.830 --> 16:41.866
I don't want anybody messing...
You know... With the, you know.

16:41.867 --> 16:45.703
<i>(laughs)</i> well, tim,
it's perfectly natural

16:45.704 --> 16:48.104
For a man to be proud
of his virility.

16:48.105 --> 16:51.308
It gives him a sense of power
to be able to pass down
his genes.

16:51.309 --> 16:54.678
Yeah. I like power
in my genes. Oh-oh-oh.

16:54.679 --> 16:57.615
<i>(chuckles)</i> in fact,
in many cultures,

16:57.616 --> 17:00.917
A man is measured by
his ability to procreate.

17:00.918 --> 17:03.320
In the zulu tribe
of kwazulu-natal,

17:03.321 --> 17:07.258
The more children a man has,
the higher his status.

17:07.259 --> 17:10.461
I don't want to have
more children. I just like
knowing that I can.

17:10.462 --> 17:12.194
Hmm.

17:12.195 --> 17:16.031
When jill first told me
she was pregnant,
I never felt more like a man.

17:16.032 --> 17:19.470
Well, that's perfectly
understandable.

17:19.471 --> 17:22.038
I knew a guy
would understand.

17:22.039 --> 17:25.742
I also understand there are
lots of other things
that make you a man.

17:25.742 --> 17:27.377
Such as?

17:27.377 --> 17:31.214
Well, the way
you live your life,
take care of your kids...

17:31.215 --> 17:34.552
Your commitment to jill.

17:34.553 --> 17:37.054
So I should get a vasectomy?

17:37.055 --> 17:39.689
Oh, tim, I can't tell you
what to do.

17:39.690 --> 17:43.160
I do know if I had a vasectomy,
I would not feel like
any less of a man.

17:43.161 --> 17:45.662
Well, if you had one,
neither would I.

17:48.099 --> 17:50.100
Hey, tim.

17:50.101 --> 17:53.336
What are you doing here?
Did you guys come up with
another vasectomy joke?

17:53.337 --> 17:57.073
Uh, actually,
we came up with 12,

17:57.074 --> 17:59.910
But that's not why I'm here.
I, uh... <i>(clears throat)</i>

17:59.911 --> 18:04.047
I came by to apologize
for the other day.
We were a little rough on you.

18:04.048 --> 18:05.716
Hey, no kidding.

18:05.717 --> 18:08.385
Harry, I can
take a joke, ok?
Yeah.

18:08.386 --> 18:11.187
You know, tim, lots of guys
have had vasectomies,

18:11.188 --> 18:13.624
And they're just as manly
as they ever were.

18:13.625 --> 18:16.326
Oh, yeah? You name one.

18:18.062 --> 18:20.197
Me.
Huh?

18:20.198 --> 18:23.433
Yeah. I had one
five years ago.

18:25.937 --> 18:28.873
Really? At least we know
it doesn't make your voice
get any higher.

18:28.874 --> 18:31.175
Actually, it did.

18:33.444 --> 18:37.047
If you got a vasectomy,
why didn't you say something
in your store the other day?

18:37.048 --> 18:41.184
Oh, in front of those jerks?
Look how they went after you.

18:41.185 --> 18:43.487
I can't believe
you had a vasectomy.

18:43.488 --> 18:45.689
Delores wanted to have
her tubes tied,

18:45.690 --> 18:47.958
And she was really scared
about the operation.

18:47.959 --> 18:51.061
You know, she's been through
childbirth four times, and...

18:51.062 --> 18:55.199
I've been to 'nam. I've been
shot, stabbed, kicked, bit,
mortared, bombed.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.834
I figured, hey,
what's a snip or two?

18:59.603 --> 19:01.738
You know, this is amazing.
Really amazing.

19:01.739 --> 19:03.740
You know a guy
all your life,

19:03.741 --> 19:06.076
And you don't know what's
going on under his pants.

19:11.650 --> 19:14.651
You know, just between
you and me,
there's nothing to it.

19:14.652 --> 19:18.389
You feel the same as you did
before. The only difference
is your sex life.

19:18.390 --> 19:22.259
What happens to it?
Anytime, anyplace.

19:22.260 --> 19:24.628
<i>(laughs)</i>

19:24.629 --> 19:26.397
Anytime, anyplace.

19:26.398 --> 19:27.464
You got it.

19:27.465 --> 19:29.600
So this helped
your relationship?

19:29.601 --> 19:31.468
Well, nothing could help
our relationship.

19:31.469 --> 19:34.638
But our sex life
is a lot better.

19:34.639 --> 19:37.107
This morning,
I was getting ready
to go to work,

19:37.108 --> 19:40.210
Dolores came in with curlers
in her hair and nothing else...

19:40.211 --> 19:42.212
Harry,
you've helped enough.

19:46.384 --> 19:48.986
I'd love to stay,
but I promised my mom
I'd be home by 5:30,

19:48.987 --> 19:52.689
And if I'm late,
she'll lecture me,
and she goes on and on and on.

19:52.690 --> 19:54.724
You can't get
a word in edgewise.

19:54.725 --> 19:56.827
I don't know if you know
any people like that.

19:56.828 --> 19:58.896
Just one.
See ya.

19:58.897 --> 20:00.130
Bye.
Hi.

20:00.131 --> 20:01.832
Bye.
Bye.

20:03.835 --> 20:06.303
<i>(sniffs)</i> whoo. Smells good.
What are we eating?

20:06.304 --> 20:08.338
Takeout.

20:08.339 --> 20:11.341
Ah, my favorite.
I think I'm ready to talk.

20:11.342 --> 20:13.310
About?

20:13.311 --> 20:16.347
About what
you want to talk about that
I didn't want to talk about.

20:16.348 --> 20:18.716
The vasectomy?
Yep.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.884
I think the trouble
I'm having

20:20.885 --> 20:24.921
Is that even though
I don't want any more children,

20:24.922 --> 20:29.093
The thought that I can't
would kind of make me
feel like...

20:29.094 --> 20:32.162
Less of a man.
That would be it.

20:32.964 --> 20:35.198
Tim, if I had
my tubes tied,

20:35.199 --> 20:37.368
Would you see me
as less of a woman?

20:37.369 --> 20:38.636
No.

20:38.637 --> 20:41.371
Why should it be
any different for you?

20:41.372 --> 20:43.674
And why would it be
any different for me?

20:43.675 --> 20:46.042
If you did this,

20:46.043 --> 20:48.846
Not only would you
be protecting me
from surgery,

20:48.847 --> 20:54.184
But you'd be
making a real commitment
to me and our relationship.

20:54.185 --> 20:56.720
In my eyes,
that makes you
more of a man.

20:56.721 --> 20:58.755
<i>(grunts)</i> I want to be
more of a man. Yeah.

21:01.893 --> 21:04.361
What do you think?
I think
I have more questions.

21:04.362 --> 21:07.097
Ok. Such as what?

21:07.098 --> 21:11.001
Do they make a home kit
so I can do it right here
in the garage?

21:11.002 --> 21:13.203
I don't think so.

21:14.439 --> 21:16.473
Could this count as
your birthday present?

21:16.474 --> 21:19.076
Absolutely, yeah.

21:19.077 --> 21:21.545
For once, I wouldn't have to
stand in line to return it.

21:23.281 --> 21:25.649
And while
I'm preparing
for this,

21:25.650 --> 21:28.419
Will you go out and find me
a very, very mild aftershave?

21:29.954 --> 21:31.722
Yeah, I'll work on that.

21:31.723 --> 21:33.990
Gotta be careful about
slapping it on, too.

21:44.368 --> 21:47.237
We're going to the park.
We'll be back in a bit.

21:47.238 --> 21:49.940
Ok, dinner's at six.
All right. We'll be here.

21:49.941 --> 21:51.241
All right.

21:56.781 --> 21:59.115
<i>(gasps)</i>

21:59.116 --> 22:00.651
Honey...

22:00.652 --> 22:04.320
I don't know if this vasectomy
was such a good idea.

22:06.024 --> 22:09.225
Sure it was.
Anywhere, anytime.

22:10.528 --> 22:11.561
Kitchen counter?

22:11.562 --> 22:14.865
No, no, no.
The attic.

22:17.635 --> 22:20.303
No. That was too dusty.

22:20.304 --> 22:22.906
Maybe we should try someplace
we haven't been in a while.

22:24.408 --> 22:25.408
Our bedroom.
Bedroom.

22:29.747 --> 22:31.814
Um... While
I'm preparing
for this,

22:31.815 --> 22:35.151
Will you go out
and find me a very,
very mild aftershave?

22:37.021 --> 22:38.921
I'd work on it, yes.

22:44.862 --> 22:47.331
Remind me
not to use toilet paper
if I nick myself.
