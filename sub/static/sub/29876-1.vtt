one of the hottest toys

01:08.969 --> 01:10.469
of the season.

01:10.571 --> 01:13.205
It can make and learn custom
sounds that kids create,

01:13.307 --> 01:14.640
like whinnies or neighs.

01:14.742 --> 01:17.142
Or they can make it into a
talking horse.

business.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.546
Yeah, I guess
you could say that.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.682
I actually used to make wooden
toys when I was young.

anything like these

made of wood,

he's concerned.

decide if you want to sell

the house, too.

work early,

wanted to be?

Wentzell

04:05.646 --> 04:07.412

distinction.

get mad at you at christmas.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.351
And anyway, aren't you the boss?

04:12.453 --> 04:15.487

every year since we moved here

04:37.478 --> 04:39.211

you're old enough now!

04:39.313 --> 04:41.013
Why wouldn't you?

You love singing.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.918
Keith:
And you really love christmas
songs.

04:47.021 --> 04:48.787
That sounds like a match made in
the north pole to me.

04:54.928 --> 04:58.730
Auditions are after school. Just
think about it, okay?

05:00.501 --> 05:03.068
Go get your backpack.

05:07.041 --> 05:10.042
I have to get going too, but
I'll try to encourage her

05:10.144 --> 05:11.777
when I pick her up this
afternoon.

05:11.879 --> 05:14.246
Thank you. Best sister
in-law-ever.

Mm-hm, that's what the coffee
mug says.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.618
Hey, um, any word about
the mill?

05:19.720 --> 05:23.722
No, not yet. Mrs. Wentzell still
hasn't decided

05:23.824 --> 05:24.956
whether or not she's gonna sell.

05:25.059 --> 05:27.592
They employ half the town.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.461
I know. If it closes,

05:29.563 --> 05:31.263
there's gonna be a lot of people
out of work.

05:31.365 --> 05:32.898
Maybe you should consider the
job they offered you

05:33.000 --> 05:34.466
at the mill in vermont.

05:34.568 --> 05:37.636
I don't want to uproot jessie
unless I have to.

05:37.738 --> 05:39.504
Took her a long time to get used
to north bay

05:39.606 --> 05:42.407
when we moved here after
janie died.

05:42.509 --> 05:46.078
Besides, if we moved, you and
shawn would miss us too much.

05:46.180 --> 05:47.979
We'd miss jessie.

05:48.082 --> 05:50.515
Oh, come on. You love having us
live next door.

05:50.617 --> 05:51.950
My husband likes you living
next door,

05:52.052 --> 05:54.152
but only because you have
the bigger tv.

05:54.254 --> 05:57.456
I think you're... Okay, I guess.

05:57.558 --> 06:00.425
Eh, you too. I guess.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.666

Oops.

I hate that your dad's store
is closing,

06:25.753 --> 06:28.453

06:28.555 --> 06:30.655
Colleen, I'm always here for
the holidays.

06:30.758 --> 06:32.124
You come in on christmas day

06:32.226 --> 06:34.025
and then you go right back
to new york.

first grade.

06:37.664 --> 06:39.664
Well, she'll have plenty of time

Speaking of which, what are you
doing tonight?

06:43.170 --> 06:45.203
Mm, exciting stuff.

You're getting a late start this
year, huh?

06:57.084 --> 06:58.984
Well, it's the same three events
every year.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.685
Silent auction at the tree
lighting,

07:00.788 --> 07:03.155
carnival, pageant on
christmas eve.

07:03.257 --> 07:04.756
It's like cutting and pasting.

07:04.858 --> 07:07.259
The committees really just herd
reindeer, so to speak.

07:07.361 --> 07:09.528
Well, I'm already herding some
pretty stubborn reindeer

07:09.630 --> 07:12.097

meeting tom novak

07:12.199 --> 07:13.932

school boyfriend?!

it up again.

All right, come on. Let's go.

I still wish you
did things like this.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.831
Yeah, well, new york apartments
are expensive,

11:06.933 --> 11:08.800
even without a wood shop.

11:08.902 --> 11:12.070
So... What do you want me to do
with these?

11:12.172 --> 11:14.172
I don't know. I can't really
keep them at my place.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.573
We can't just throw them away!

11:15.676 --> 11:17.809
Well, we can't keep every
memory in here.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.778
You should at least keep one.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.279
Hm...

Hi, sorry, we're not open yet.

11:35.862 --> 11:38.196
I know, it's an emergency.

11:38.298 --> 11:39.998
A toy emergency?

11:40.100 --> 11:42.867
I forgot to bring something for
the toy drive at school.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.954
And those santa figurines aren't
the work of somebody

21:30.056 --> 21:32.423
who considered wood carving
an idle hobby.

21:32.525 --> 21:35.293
I guess you're right.

21:35.395 --> 21:37.795
I used to spend hours in
that workshop.

21:37.897 --> 21:41.065
My dad used to have to
drag me out.

21:41.167 --> 21:42.466
So what changed?

21:43.469 --> 21:45.102
I guess I did.

21:46.773 --> 21:49.073
Anyway, where were we? Okay,
so this weekend,

21:49.175 --> 21:51.442
we've got the silent auction and
tree lighting.

21:51.544 --> 21:53.544
Oh, we've got volunteers to
collect all the items

21:53.646 --> 21:55.913
and set everything up, so I
guess that leaves

21:56.015 --> 21:57.481
just looking at the big
artificial tree.

21:57.583 --> 21:59.317
We can stop by the warehouse on
the way to the tree lot.

21:59.419 --> 22:00.785
- Great.
- Yeah.

22:00.887 --> 22:02.420
And then the following weekend
is the carnival,

22:02.522 --> 22:04.155
today I'm going to speak to the
guy who is bringing in

22:04.257 --> 22:06.290
all the booths and games, so
we're good there.

22:06.392 --> 22:09.226
Right, and I'm making calls to
find some sponsors to pay for

22:09.329 --> 22:11.262
everything, we came up a little
short on the budget this year.

22:11.364 --> 22:13.664
That just leaves the pageant for
christmas eve.

22:13.766 --> 22:15.633
Mr. Flannery at the school is
handling all the music,

22:15.735 --> 22:19.236
so we just need to get programs
and decorate.

22:19.339 --> 22:20.805
This all seems pretty doable.

22:20.907 --> 22:22.740
This is gonna be a piece of
christmas fruitcake.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.241
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

22:24.344 --> 22:26.010
What do you mean the tree
is gone?

22:26.112 --> 22:28.512
I mean it's gone. Nobody knows
where it is.

22:28.614 --> 22:30.948
How do you lose a 40 foot tall
christmas tree?

22:31.050 --> 22:33.684
This is a disaster. The tree
lighting is what brings

22:33.786 --> 22:36.454
everyone out, and then they bid
on the silent auction items.

22:36.556 --> 22:38.923
The school depends on that to
fund the music program.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.858
Okay, can't we just buy
another tree?

22:40.960 --> 22:43.127
Do you know how expensive those
are? We can't afford it.

22:43.229 --> 22:45.629
Okay, look, let's not panic.
Maybe martin at the tree lot

22:45.732 --> 22:47.198
knows where we can find
a big tree.

22:47.300 --> 22:49.967
And I work at a lumber mill.
We have a lot of trees!

22:50.069 --> 22:51.836
- Yeah.
- We'll figure something out.

22:51.938 --> 22:55.139
The tallest one I've got is
about 10 feet.

22:55.241 --> 22:57.341
I don't have anything big enough
for the tree lighting.

22:57.443 --> 22:58.609
Well, do you know anyone
that would?

22:58.711 --> 23:00.378
Not this late in the season.

23:00.480 --> 23:04.148
It's all right. I'll see what I
can find at the mill tomorrow.

23:04.250 --> 23:05.816
Okay, just let me know which
ones you want for the pageant,

23:05.918 --> 23:08.185
- and I'll have them delivered.
- Thanks, martin.

23:08.287 --> 23:09.487
- You're welcome.
- Thanks.

23:09.589 --> 23:11.288
- Let's go take a look around.
- Okay.

23:13.259 --> 23:15.893
That's a pretty great kid
you've got there.

23:15.995 --> 23:20.464
Yeah, she's something else. I'm
not sure how I got that lucky.

23:20.566 --> 23:24.068
Oh, I'd say good parenting
deserves more credit than luck.

23:24.170 --> 23:27.171
You know, I do what I can with
patty and shawn.

23:27.273 --> 23:29.473
My sister-in-law and her
husband, they, uh...

23:29.575 --> 23:31.709
They've been a huge help. It was
actually their idea

23:31.811 --> 23:34.078
for us to move here when my wife
passed away a few years ago.

23:34.180 --> 23:37.882
Oh, I'm sorry. That must have
been tough.

23:37.984 --> 23:42.253
Yeah, it was, but jessie and I
helped each other through it.

23:42.355 --> 23:44.054
You live in new york, right?

23:44.157 --> 23:45.556
Yeah, that's where I tell
everyone what their kids

23:45.658 --> 23:47.091
want for christmas.

23:47.193 --> 23:49.360
I thought I was getting a
do-over.

23:49.462 --> 23:51.695
Right. Forgot about that.

23:51.798 --> 23:55.332
You know, I don't think I could
ever live in new york.

23:55.435 --> 23:58.669
I need nature. I was born to be
a lumberjack.

23:58.771 --> 24:01.272
All you need is a big blue ox.

24:01.374 --> 24:03.007
I keep her in the garage!

24:04.610 --> 24:07.011
Let's go, uh, let's go see what
jessie is doing.

24:07.113 --> 24:09.914
- You grew up here, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

24:10.016 --> 24:13.017
I got a scholarship at nyu and
just wound up staying,

24:13.119 --> 24:15.419
but I love coming back to visit.

24:15.521 --> 24:17.221
Guess you probably won't be
doing that

24:17.323 --> 24:20.257
once your dad closes the
store, huh?

24:20.359 --> 24:23.594
No, I... I guess not. Although
the way things are going

24:23.696 --> 24:26.597
with this christmas committee, I
probably won't be allowed back.

24:26.699 --> 24:29.233
Yeah, I wonder how we'll ruin
the carnival and the pageant.

24:29.335 --> 24:32.236
Hm, probably involves coal and
stockings.

24:32.338 --> 24:35.039
- Yeah.
- What about the pageant?

24:35.141 --> 24:37.875
It's gonna be great!

24:37.977 --> 24:40.277
You know, jessie, you should be
really proud of yourself.

24:40.379 --> 24:42.046
I was 15 before I got a solo.

24:42.148 --> 24:45.749
You had a solo too? Will you
help me with my song?!

24:45.852 --> 24:49.587
Oh, I don't know, um...

24:49.689 --> 24:51.088
Please? It was your santa that
got me to audition

24:51.190 --> 24:53.090
- in the first place.
- Really?

24:53.192 --> 24:55.392
Yes! I wasn't gonna do it, but
then super santa

24:55.495 --> 24:56.994
reminded me to be brave.

24:57.096 --> 25:00.998
Oh, that's very sweet. You sure
you want me to help?

25:01.100 --> 25:02.266
I mean, what about your dad?

25:02.368 --> 25:03.901
Have you heard him sing?

25:04.003 --> 25:07.638
- Oh...
- Okay, number one, ouch!

25:07.740 --> 25:11.942
And number two... She's
totally right.

25:12.044 --> 25:15.946
Oh, jessie, I don't know. I
haven't sung since I was a kid

25:16.048 --> 25:17.781
and I really was not that great.

25:17.884 --> 25:22.152
You had a solo, so you must have
been! Please?

25:22.255 --> 25:24.488

25:24.590 --> 25:26.824

on all the places

25:45.912 --> 25:48.212

get the listing posted.

we were able to come up with
something just as wonderful,

the button.

something simple

Yeah. Yeah, I usually only
make it for a day or two,

40:05.470 --> 40:07.437

around all those toys.

40:15.380 --> 40:18.047

that it was santa's workshop.

40:18.150 --> 40:19.282
I kept expecting
to see elves.

40:19.384 --> 40:22.786

you'll miss it?

40:29.728 --> 40:32.562
Uh, yeah, maybe.

40:32.664 --> 40:34.564
But times change,
you know?

40:34.666 --> 40:36.232
It's like
the santa carvings.

40:36.334 --> 40:38.134
I loved doing that
when I was a kid

40:38.236 --> 40:41.004
but maybe it's time
to let those go too.

40:41.106 --> 40:44.140
And replace them with some
high-tech doohickey, right?

40:44.242 --> 40:45.909
Doohickey?

40:46.011 --> 40:48.011
What is this, 1952?

40:48.113 --> 40:50.513

a new career path.

So, I guess I'm not
the only one in the family

41:34.926 --> 41:36.392
who works with wood now,
huh?

41:36.495 --> 41:38.161
Yeah, it was really fun!

41:38.263 --> 41:39.963
And not as hard
as I thought it was gonna be.

41:40.065 --> 41:41.865
Mm-hm, you're a natural,
kiddo.

41:43.201 --> 41:44.868
- That's really cool.
- Yeah.

41:46.471 --> 41:48.371
- Somethin' wrong?
- Um...

41:50.141 --> 41:54.677
Jess, lemme show you the new
project I'm working on, huh?

41:58.416 --> 42:00.016
What's going on?

42:00.118 --> 42:01.818
That was colleen.
She just got a call

42:01.920 --> 42:03.419
from mr. Flannery
at the school

42:03.522 --> 42:05.555
and apparently
he has a family emergency

42:05.657 --> 42:06.856
and has to go to boston.

42:06.958 --> 42:09.359
He won't be back
until after christmas.

42:09.461 --> 42:10.660
What about the pageant?

42:10.762 --> 42:12.095
I don't know.
He does everything-

42:12.197 --> 42:14.731
the music, the arrangements,
the piano.

42:14.833 --> 42:18.001
I don't know how
we're gonna replace him.

42:18.103 --> 42:20.203
I don't know how
I'm gonna tell jessie.

42:27.245 --> 42:29.679
♪ oh come let us adore him

42:29.781 --> 42:33.516
♪ christ, the lord

42:33.618 --> 42:35.952
is that better?
- So much better!

42:36.054 --> 42:38.621
Jessie,
you're really getting this!

42:38.723 --> 42:40.723
I know my musical sensibilities
are in question here,

42:40.825 --> 42:43.626
but uh, for what it's worth,
I agree, sweetie.

42:43.728 --> 42:47.030
I hope
mr. Flannery like sit.

42:47.132 --> 42:49.032
When am I gonna practice
with him again?

42:51.803 --> 42:53.403
I'm not quite sure,
sweetheart.

42:53.505 --> 42:55.939
Uh, jessie, why don't you sing
it through one more time

42:56.041 --> 42:57.807
without the piano
while I talk to your dad?

42:57.909 --> 42:59.142
Okay!

43:03.815 --> 43:06.716
♪ oh come, all ye faithful--

43:06.818 --> 43:10.219
- what are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

43:10.322 --> 43:11.955
I've been on the phone all day

43:12.057 --> 43:15.258
trying to find someone with
musical skills to take over.

43:15.360 --> 43:17.760
No luck.
- I know, same here.

43:17.862 --> 43:20.229
There must be someone in town
with musical ability.

43:22.233 --> 43:23.499
(stammering)

43:23.602 --> 43:24.968
you've been doing great
with jessie.

43:25.070 --> 43:26.302
Maybe you could do it.

43:26.404 --> 43:27.570
- Me?
- Yeah!

43:27.672 --> 43:29.772
(laughing)
no, no, no, not me.

43:29.874 --> 43:32.275
There's got to be somebody
more qualified.

43:32.377 --> 43:33.676
Whenever I'm playing piano,

43:33.778 --> 43:36.512
I always picture my mom,
smiling and encouraging

43:36.615 --> 43:38.848
but also wincing,
a little.

43:38.950 --> 43:41.017
So she taught you?

43:41.119 --> 43:43.119
Yeah, she did. If I wasn't
in the workshop with my dad,

43:43.221 --> 43:44.354
I was playing piano
with my mom.

43:44.456 --> 43:46.923
Oh. That's sweet.

43:47.025 --> 43:49.292
Yeah, it's been tough for my dad
ever since she passed.

43:49.394 --> 43:50.960
That's why my sister and I
are encouraging him to retire

43:51.062 --> 43:52.295
and move closer to us.

43:53.598 --> 43:55.531
So you and your sister
must be close.

43:55.634 --> 43:57.133
Yeah. I mean,
she's in connecticut

43:57.235 --> 43:58.768
with a husband and the kids
and I'm in the city,

43:58.870 --> 44:00.103
but we talk all the time.

44:01.239 --> 44:02.505
So the husband and the kids

44:02.607 --> 44:03.973
and the suburbs thing
isn't for you?

44:05.910 --> 44:08.144
I don't know. I mean--

44:08.246 --> 44:10.046
I certainly admit
it has its appeal.

44:11.683 --> 44:14.183
Okay, listen. Let's just focus
on one thing at a time.

44:14.285 --> 44:15.652
We'll deal with the pageant
right after the carnival

44:15.754 --> 44:17.053
tomorrow night.

44:17.155 --> 44:18.821
Right. At least that's
still going well.

44:18.923 --> 44:19.822
(whispering)
don't jinx it!

44:19.924 --> 44:21.157
Sorry.

44:26.331 --> 44:27.997
So

44:28.099 --> 44:29.999
right here.
- Yeah, that sounds good.

44:30.101 --> 44:31.868
I'm off to the store.
I'll see you two later.

44:31.970 --> 44:33.469
Okay.
I'm right behind you, dad.

44:33.571 --> 44:35.038
We just need
a few more minutes here.

44:35.140 --> 44:36.372
We need to finish
cleaning out that store room.

44:36.474 --> 44:38.141
Annie, that can wait.

44:38.243 --> 44:39.442
Dad, it can't!

44:39.544 --> 44:40.810
Tom's already
listed the building.

44:40.912 --> 44:42.545
You need to get ready
to move out.

44:42.647 --> 44:44.514
It'll probably take a while
to get an offer,

44:44.616 --> 44:46.115
and then there's escrow.

44:46.217 --> 44:48.351
The carnival's tonight, huh?
We'll do it later.

44:48.453 --> 44:51.487
I'll be there shortly
and we can do it together.

44:53.591 --> 44:54.891
Okay.
- (chuckling)

44:56.294 --> 44:57.727
I think this is payback

44:57.829 --> 44:59.362
for all the times
he made me clean my room.

44:59.464 --> 45:01.197
Well, as the parent
of a young daughter,

45:01.299 --> 45:02.899
I'm on his side.

45:05.570 --> 45:07.403
Listen, I appreciate
you giving up your Saturday

45:07.505 --> 45:08.838
to finalize everything.

45:08.940 --> 45:10.707
Oh, happy to do it.

45:10.809 --> 45:12.809
Patty and jessie
are christmas shopping anyway.

45:12.911 --> 45:15.712
Is uh, is jessie looking forward
to the carnival tonight?

45:15.814 --> 45:16.713
Oh, yeah.

45:16.815 --> 45:18.147
We have this little thing

45:18.249 --> 45:20.083
with the snowball toss
every year.

45:20.185 --> 45:23.319
She thinks I let her win and I
go ahead and let her think that.

45:23.421 --> 45:25.254
Mmm. Saving your pride.

45:25.356 --> 45:27.156
Yeah, maybe.
- (chuckling)

45:27.258 --> 45:29.025
oh, by the way,

45:29.127 --> 45:30.593
jessie had so much fun
carving with your dad.

45:30.695 --> 45:33.396
Ah, yeah,
I'm not surprised.

45:33.498 --> 45:34.997
In addition
to being a great teacher,

45:35.100 --> 45:36.833
he, uh, he knows
how to make it fun.

45:38.169 --> 45:39.669
So why don't you
do it anymore?

45:39.771 --> 45:41.704
I don't know. It's, uh--

45:41.806 --> 45:44.741
it's just hard to find time
for things like that.

45:44.843 --> 45:46.075
It's like with music,
you know.

45:46.177 --> 45:48.611
You gotta grow up at some point.
- Mmm.

45:50.014 --> 45:51.414
Okay. Let's get back
to business.

45:51.516 --> 45:52.915
This village is not
gonna build itself.

45:53.017 --> 45:55.685
Oh! That would be really cool
if it did!

45:55.787 --> 45:57.120
(chuckling)

45:57.222 --> 45:58.621
okay, back to work.
(clearing throat)

45:58.723 --> 46:01.691
(carnival style music playing)

46:06.598 --> 46:08.765
- you've got this. You got this.
- All right.

46:08.867 --> 46:10.566
All:
Ooh!

46:10.668 --> 46:12.602
All right, jess, okay, if you
move a little bit to the right--

46:12.704 --> 46:13.870
dad!

46:13.972 --> 46:16.639
Okay! Okay, sorry.
(chuckling)

46:18.209 --> 46:19.542
- (all cheering)
- yes!

46:19.644 --> 46:22.612
- Attagirl! Nice!
- Anne: Nicely done!

46:22.714 --> 46:24.280
- Take your pick.
- Ooh, I pick this one.

46:24.382 --> 46:25.748
Okay!
Let's go play another game.

46:25.850 --> 46:27.750
Okay. Bye!

46:30.889 --> 46:33.823
So, we really need
to talk about the pageant.

46:33.925 --> 46:36.559
All right. Sure, yeah. We can
meet at the shop tomorrow

46:36.661 --> 46:38.127
and see what
we can come up with.

46:38.229 --> 46:40.096
Or, you could just take over
from mr. Flannery.

46:40.198 --> 46:41.731
- Exactly!
- Hmm.

46:41.833 --> 46:42.965
Oh, look, it's tom!

46:43.067 --> 46:45.835
Hey! There you are.
You havin' fun?

46:45.937 --> 46:47.737
Yeah, we're just
celebrating jessie's win

46:47.839 --> 46:49.438
at the snowball toss.
- Oh, nice!

46:49.541 --> 46:52.608
You know, it used to be my
favourite game when I was a kid.

46:52.710 --> 46:55.311
Anne, you up for a little
friendly competition?

46:55.413 --> 46:57.647
- You're on.
- Let's do it.

47:00.819 --> 47:03.085
I don't know what
we're gonna do about her.

47:04.222 --> 47:05.822
Those are for you.

47:05.924 --> 47:07.456
Yeah.

47:10.195 --> 47:12.094
Neither do I.

47:13.932 --> 47:16.265
Anne:
That is so fun!

47:16.367 --> 47:18.167
I'm so happy
I won this for you.

47:18.269 --> 47:20.002
Oh, you just want me
to carry this around all night,

47:20.104 --> 47:22.271
don't you?
- (chuckling)

47:22.373 --> 47:23.673
- hey.
- Hey.

47:23.775 --> 47:25.274
So, I have to get going.

47:25.376 --> 47:26.609
I have an early morning showing
on another property.

47:26.711 --> 47:27.877
Oh, okay.

47:27.979 --> 47:29.045
Um, keith,
it was great to see you.

47:29.147 --> 47:30.046
You too.

47:30.148 --> 47:31.681
Anne, I will call you tomorrow.

47:31.783 --> 47:33.449
We already have a couple
of nibbles on the building.

47:33.551 --> 47:34.884
- Oh, great!
- Yeah.

47:34.986 --> 47:36.786
- Good night.
- Okay, good night! Bye.

47:39.891 --> 47:42.225
- Cotton candy?
- Yes, please!

47:43.928 --> 47:46.562
So, uh,
tom seems like a nice guy.

47:46.664 --> 47:48.364
Yeah, he is.
I've known him forever.

47:48.466 --> 47:49.999
Mm.

47:50.101 --> 47:51.500
It's nice to have connections
like that, you know?

47:51.603 --> 47:54.003
- Yeah.
- It's tough in new york.

47:54.105 --> 47:55.905
So, now boyfriend back there?

47:56.007 --> 47:59.242
No. I mean,
I work all the time.

47:59.344 --> 48:00.576
Or, I don't know.

48:00.678 --> 48:02.378
Maybe I just haven't met
the right guy.

48:02.480 --> 48:05.147
Ah, I get it.
I'm in the same boat.

48:05.250 --> 48:07.850
I dated a couple times
after my wife passed away

48:07.952 --> 48:11.220
but uh, you know,
between work and jess...

48:11.322 --> 48:13.689
Some day.
- Yeah, some day.

48:16.060 --> 48:17.593
We've only got a week
until the pageant.

48:17.695 --> 48:19.595
Everyone is getting
very nervous.

48:19.697 --> 48:20.930
Yeah, I got a call
from the guy who plays the organ

48:21.032 --> 48:22.331
at the church
down the street,

48:22.433 --> 48:23.933
and he said
that he'd play the piano,

48:24.035 --> 48:26.002
but as far as
directing the choir,

48:26.104 --> 48:27.837
the barbershop quartets,
and the solos,

48:27.939 --> 48:29.538
we're still looking.

48:29.641 --> 48:31.407
Colleen:
Well, if only we knew
someone who was musical

48:31.509 --> 48:33.442
that did the pageant
every single year.

48:33.544 --> 48:35.111
Yeah, it would be convenient

48:35.213 --> 48:36.612
if someone like that
was around.

48:36.714 --> 48:38.414
Yeah, guys,
there's a big difference

48:38.516 --> 48:40.016
between singing in the pageant
when you're a kid

48:40.118 --> 48:41.517
and directing it.

48:41.619 --> 48:42.919
Come on, you were doing
so great with jessie.

48:43.021 --> 48:44.553
Yeah, not the same thing either.

48:44.656 --> 48:46.289
Well, if we don't find someone
in the next day or two,

48:46.391 --> 48:47.957
we're going to have to cancel
the whole thing.

48:48.059 --> 48:49.859
Well, we still have
a couple days to keep looking.

48:49.961 --> 48:51.093
Bill:
Ha!

48:51.195 --> 48:52.929
Would you look at that,
huh?

48:54.866 --> 48:56.866
It's music santa. Hmm?

49:00.872 --> 49:02.405
"I am music santa.

49:02.507 --> 49:05.074
"I remind people that a
christmas carol is a joyous way

49:05.176 --> 49:09.211
"to bring the holidays to life
and life to the holidays."

49:09.314 --> 49:11.280
really, dad?
You just happened

49:11.382 --> 49:13.149
to stumble on this one?
- Well, you know.

49:13.251 --> 49:16.419
Anything is possible
at christmas.

49:21.359 --> 49:22.825
Okay, fine!
- Yay!

49:22.927 --> 49:23.926
- I'll do it!
- (laughing)

49:24.028 --> 49:25.628
that's my girl!

49:27.298 --> 49:28.597

and a happy new year ♪

49:47.685 --> 49:49.085
excellent!

Okay, we're gonna
take a quick break

49:50.888 --> 49:53.189
and then the twelve days
of christmas is up next.

49:53.291 --> 49:54.523
Thank you.

49:56.494 --> 49:57.493
Sounds great!

49:57.595 --> 49:59.161
Really?

49:59.263 --> 50:01.130
I just wish we had a few more
voices to fill it in.

50:01.232 --> 50:02.765
Anne, it's going to be
fantastic.

50:02.867 --> 50:04.300
Just relax and enjoy it.

50:05.269 --> 50:06.535
Right. Right!

50:06.637 --> 50:07.870
We're singing
christmas carols.

50:07.972 --> 50:09.705
This should be jolly,
not awkward.

50:09.807 --> 50:13.042
No. Not as awkward as when
you hugged keith yesterday.

50:13.144 --> 50:15.811
Oh, that was just
a spur-of-the-moment thing.

50:15.913 --> 50:17.513
Like, "woo!
I'm doin' the pageant!

50:17.615 --> 50:19.048
"here, have a friendly,

50:19.150 --> 50:20.816

50:20.918 --> 50:22.518
"good tidings"?

50:22.620 --> 50:25.321
It's the christmas
decorations.

50:25.423 --> 50:26.989
(chuckling)
well, what about tom?

50:27.091 --> 50:28.724
You've been spending time
with him too.

50:28.826 --> 50:30.893
Oh, just a couple meetings
about selling the building.

50:30.995 --> 50:33.462
Just sounds like you've got
a lot of possibilities.

50:33.564 --> 50:35.631
Well, none of it
means anything.

50:35.733 --> 50:37.666
After christmas, I'm gone.
I'm back to new york.

50:37.769 --> 50:39.502
So, it can't mean anything.

50:39.604 --> 50:40.970
Okay. If you say so.

50:41.072 --> 50:42.538
♪ we wish you
a merry christmas ♪

50:42.640 --> 50:43.873
but tell me this-

50:43.975 --> 50:45.241
when you say
it can't mean anything,

50:45.343 --> 50:47.843
do you mean keith or tom?

50:47.945 --> 50:50.046
(sighing, nervous chuckling)

50:54.719 --> 50:59.088
hey! Santa's village
is starting to look good!

50:59.190 --> 51:01.190
This is the house
of candy canes.

51:01.292 --> 51:03.526
We can just hang them
on these little hooks here.

51:03.628 --> 51:05.194
And this is
the house of snowmen.

51:05.296 --> 51:08.030
- I love it.
- Thank you.

51:08.132 --> 51:10.666
Listen, I'm gonna practice
a little more with jessie

51:10.768 --> 51:12.535
and then she's gonna be done
for the day.

51:12.637 --> 51:13.869
- Keith: Okay.
- Wanted to let you know.

51:13.971 --> 51:16.038
- All right. I'll be here.
- Okay.

51:18.176 --> 51:20.209
(keith whistling "jingle bells")

51:22.113 --> 51:23.045
you're very merry!

51:23.147 --> 51:24.613
Yeah, well,

51:24.715 --> 51:26.615
I'm just a happy elf
whistling while he works.

51:26.717 --> 51:28.617
That's the seven dwarfs.

51:28.719 --> 51:32.021
Right. Well, I'm whistling
a christmas carol, so it counts.

51:32.123 --> 51:34.190
All of this merriment
doesn't have anything to do

51:34.292 --> 51:36.959
with a certain christmas
committee co-chair, does it?

51:38.296 --> 51:40.563
Maybe. A little.

51:42.033 --> 51:42.965
Do you like her?

51:43.067 --> 51:44.700
I said "a little".

51:44.802 --> 51:46.802
Did you talk to her
about it?

51:46.904 --> 51:49.638
No, I-- I don't know
how she feels, okay?

51:49.740 --> 51:51.440
And the whole fact that
she's heading back to new york

51:51.542 --> 51:53.609
after christmas and--

51:53.711 --> 51:55.711
you know,
this whole tom thing.

51:55.813 --> 51:57.213
All of which
could be sorted out

51:57.315 --> 51:58.914
by, you know,
talking to her?

51:59.016 --> 52:00.249
Hmm.

52:01.819 --> 52:03.085
But at the very least,
you could do something

52:03.187 --> 52:04.420
to show her how you feel!

52:09.327 --> 52:11.427
(whistling)

52:13.197 --> 52:14.830
it's too late
to change my song, right?

52:14.932 --> 52:17.266
You don't wanna do "oh come
all ye faithful" anymore?

52:17.368 --> 52:18.934
I heard kylie morgan practicing.

52:19.036 --> 52:21.070
She's doing
"hark the herald angels sing".

52:21.172 --> 52:23.572
It's really, really good.
Better than me!

52:23.674 --> 52:26.242
Jessie, it's not a competition.

52:26.344 --> 52:28.244
I know, but I wanna be
really, really good.

52:28.346 --> 52:29.745
And you are!

52:29.847 --> 52:31.147
What if people don't like it?

52:31.249 --> 52:33.916
People are gonna love it.
Are you kidding?

52:34.018 --> 52:35.151
I'm gonna love it,

52:35.253 --> 52:37.586
your dad is gonna love it.

52:37.688 --> 52:40.089
In fact, I bet he's gonna be
cheering you on so loudly,

52:40.191 --> 52:41.490
it's gonna embarrass you.

52:41.592 --> 52:44.126
Probably. Does your dad
ever do stuff like that?

52:44.228 --> 52:46.362
(chuckling)
all the time.

52:46.464 --> 52:47.863
That's what dads do, though!

52:47.965 --> 52:49.832
To him, everything I do
is worth cheering about.

52:49.934 --> 52:51.433
Like your santas.

52:51.536 --> 52:52.434
Yes, perfect example.

52:52.537 --> 52:53.869
He thinks they're great.

52:53.971 --> 52:55.304
So do I!

52:55.406 --> 52:58.040
Oh, thank you.
But they're a little--

52:58.142 --> 53:00.309
(sighing)
--I don't know.

53:00.411 --> 53:01.644
I mean, wouldn't you rather have

53:01.746 --> 53:03.212
a computerized
programmable horse

53:03.314 --> 53:06.115
that you can teach to talk?

53:06.217 --> 53:08.851
I mean, that's pretty cool,

53:08.953 --> 53:11.687
but I think santa's better
than a talking horse any day,

53:11.789 --> 53:12.988
don't you think?

53:13.090 --> 53:15.691
Yeah. Yeah, maybe he is.

53:15.793 --> 53:17.726
You should make more.

53:17.828 --> 53:20.529
You know, jessie,
I'm not sure I'd still know how.

53:20.631 --> 53:22.498
You will. And santa
will help you remember.

53:22.600 --> 53:25.467
Can't argue with that.
(chuckling)

53:26.737 --> 53:27.670
I'll think about it, okay?

53:27.772 --> 53:29.705
Now, let's practice.

53:37.181 --> 53:38.447
Bill:
Remember this?

53:38.549 --> 53:41.050
Hmm?

53:41.152 --> 53:43.953
This is the first tool
you ever used.

53:44.055 --> 53:45.454
Still has
your initials in it.

53:45.556 --> 53:47.056
(giggling)

53:47.158 --> 53:48.958
you used to have to pry this
thing out of my hand.

53:49.060 --> 53:50.392
Mm-hm.

53:50.494 --> 53:52.027
You'd have stayed up
all night if I hadn't.

53:52.129 --> 53:54.697
(giggling)

53:54.799 --> 53:56.999
oh, so many
good memories here.

53:57.101 --> 54:00.035
Yes, there are.

54:00.137 --> 54:02.371
Not gonna be easy
to say goodbye to them, is it?

54:02.473 --> 54:04.139
No, it's not.

54:04.242 --> 54:07.676
But, I don't know, maybe one day
I'll start carving again.

54:07.778 --> 54:09.478
It's not really
the most practical hobby

54:09.580 --> 54:11.680
for a new york apartment.

54:14.619 --> 54:16.585
Dad, there's still time
if you wanna reconsider.

54:18.256 --> 54:19.822
I don't want
to change my mind.

54:19.924 --> 54:22.558
I can't come back
and run the store.

54:22.660 --> 54:25.027
Why not?
I mean, you love this place.

54:25.129 --> 54:27.896
I do, and I love you,
but this--

54:30.001 --> 54:32.868
it's just not me anymore.

54:32.970 --> 54:35.504
I think it's more
than you're willing to admit.

54:35.606 --> 54:39.408
Dad, I'm...I'm sorry.
I can't.

54:41.112 --> 54:43.112
(sighing)

54:44.282 --> 54:45.547
okay.

54:47.351 --> 54:49.918
Well, let's make this
the best christmas ever, okay?

54:50.021 --> 54:51.854
Yeah.

54:51.956 --> 54:52.855
One for the road.

54:52.957 --> 54:54.790
- Deal.
- Deal!

54:54.892 --> 54:57.793
- (chuckling)
- all right.

54:57.895 --> 54:59.428
Hey, you know,
this can wait.

54:59.530 --> 55:01.764
Why don't we just close up shop
early for the day

55:01.866 --> 55:03.032
and go and do something fun?

55:03.134 --> 55:05.134
You don't have to
ask me twice.

55:05.236 --> 55:07.036
All right.
- (both laughing)

55:07.138 --> 55:08.537
(door opening,
bells tinkling)

55:08.639 --> 55:10.372
- hey!
- Jessie: Hi, mister garrison!

55:10.474 --> 55:12.041
Hi, anne!
- Hi!

55:12.143 --> 55:13.409
What are you two doing here?

55:13.511 --> 55:15.244
Well, we were on our way
to go ice skating

55:15.346 --> 55:16.645
and jesse wanted to know

55:16.747 --> 55:18.414
if you two were interested
in joining us.

55:18.516 --> 55:20.249
Well, talk about good timing

55:20.351 --> 55:22.918
'cause we were just saying how
we should close up shop early

55:23.020 --> 55:24.153
and go do something fun.

55:24.255 --> 55:25.587
Keith:
Perfect.

55:25.690 --> 55:27.323
- Anne: Dad, ice skating?
- Bill: Great!

55:27.425 --> 55:29.158
But I'm not sure I'm going to be
able to pick you up anymore

55:29.260 --> 55:30.426
if you fall down.

55:30.528 --> 55:32.961
Don't worry.
Dad won't let anne fall.

55:35.700 --> 55:37.132
(awkward chuckling)

55:37.234 --> 55:38.801
all right.

55:38.903 --> 55:40.602
All right, well,

55:40.705 --> 55:43.138
what are we waiting for?

55:43.240 --> 55:45.474
Oh, you're better at this
than you said you were!

55:45.576 --> 55:46.942
Are you kidding?

55:47.044 --> 55:48.310
You've had to keep me
from falling

55:48.412 --> 55:49.778
like a dozen times!

55:49.880 --> 55:51.246
I don't think
it was quite a dozen times.

55:51.349 --> 55:52.481
It was close to that!

55:52.583 --> 55:53.949
(both laughing)
(phone buzzing)

55:54.051 --> 55:55.784
oh, hang on.
That's tom.

55:55.886 --> 55:57.519
Hey, tom, we're at
the ice skating rink.

55:57.621 --> 55:58.854
What's up?

56:00.825 --> 56:02.825
That's amazing!

56:02.927 --> 56:04.793
Oh, my--wow!
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

56:04.895 --> 56:06.462
We're gonna be there
really soon.

56:06.564 --> 56:07.696
Okay.

56:07.798 --> 56:09.465
Thank you!

56:09.567 --> 56:10.699
We got an offer on the place!

56:10.801 --> 56:12.634
Wow, that was fast.

56:12.737 --> 56:13.635
Anne:
Yeah, I know.

56:13.738 --> 56:16.038
It's-- it's really fast.

56:16.140 --> 56:17.873
Well, you must be happy.

56:17.975 --> 56:19.641
I mean, now your father
gets to be closer

56:19.744 --> 56:22.444
to your sister and you and--
new york.

56:23.547 --> 56:24.713
Yeah.

56:24.815 --> 56:25.814
(chuckling)
yeah, it's great.

56:25.916 --> 56:27.449
Yeah.

56:27.551 --> 56:28.951
It's great.

56:36.060 --> 56:37.459
You're actually
cleaning out the closet.

56:37.561 --> 56:40.629
Well, as long as we're
cleaning house,

56:40.731 --> 56:42.331
I figured I'd help you out.

56:42.433 --> 56:44.733
What about the store?
You need to get ready to open.

56:44.835 --> 56:45.734
Yeah, well,

56:45.836 --> 56:47.669
I'll get to it.

56:50.474 --> 56:52.508
Aw.

56:53.978 --> 56:57.212
"it came upon
the midnight clear".

56:57.314 --> 56:59.047
This is one
of mom's favourites.

56:59.150 --> 57:00.382
Yeah.

57:15.666 --> 57:18.367
Your mother always loved it
when you played piano.

57:18.469 --> 57:20.402
(playing stopping)

57:21.906 --> 57:24.106
(playing continues)

57:28.946 --> 57:31.780
(sighing)

57:35.519 --> 57:37.886
keith:
Jessie, we need to go!

57:40.090 --> 57:41.523
I'll take that as a "yes,
father, I'm ready to leave!"

57:41.625 --> 57:43.091
(chuckling)

57:43.194 --> 57:44.960
it's her last day of school
before winter break.

57:45.062 --> 57:47.296
Would you want to go?

57:47.398 --> 57:49.298
Yeah, fair enough.

57:49.400 --> 57:51.066
So anyway,

57:51.168 --> 57:53.368
you were saying the guy from
the mill in vermont called?

57:53.471 --> 57:55.237
Yeah.
He wants me to make a decision

57:55.339 --> 57:56.238
or he's gonna give the job

57:56.340 --> 57:57.639
to someone else.

57:57.741 --> 57:58.907
What are you gonna do?

57:59.009 --> 58:01.109
I don't know.
I don't even know

58:01.212 --> 58:02.644
if mrs. Wentzell's
gonna sell the mill or not.

58:02.746 --> 58:04.880
Are you willing
to take the risk she won't?

58:06.116 --> 58:07.583
Well, it's not just about me.

58:07.685 --> 58:10.085
It's-- it's about
all the people who work for me.

58:10.187 --> 58:12.754
It's about the entire town,
you know?

58:12.857 --> 58:15.390
There's gotta be
a better solution to this.

58:15.493 --> 58:16.825
Some way to save the mill.

58:18.562 --> 58:21.463
Keith, you know, one of the
reasons my sister loved you

58:21.565 --> 58:23.232
is because you were always
thinking of other people

58:23.334 --> 58:24.900
before yourself.

58:25.002 --> 58:27.169
But at some point, you've gotta
do what's best for you,

58:27.271 --> 58:28.804
and for your daughter.

58:28.906 --> 58:31.840
I think what's best for jessie
is to stay here,

58:31.942 --> 58:33.675
in the place she calls home with
her favourite aunt and uncle.

58:33.777 --> 58:34.943
(colleen chuckling)

58:35.045 --> 58:38.280
well, if you move to vermont,

58:38.382 --> 58:39.915
then maybe
we'll go with you.

58:40.017 --> 58:41.583
(scoffing)

58:41.685 --> 58:43.118
sure, you'll just quit your jobs
and sell your house.

58:43.220 --> 58:46.755
Why not?
People do it all the time.

58:46.857 --> 58:48.924
You'd really do that
for us?

58:49.026 --> 58:50.459
I'd consider it for jessie.

58:50.561 --> 58:52.160
You,
I'm still iffy about.

58:52.263 --> 58:54.096
Ah.
(chuckling)

58:54.198 --> 58:55.631
yeah, touché.

59:02.540 --> 59:04.172
Jessie told me to tell you

59:04.275 --> 59:05.941
that it is time to go home
and bake christmas cookies.

59:06.043 --> 59:07.543
Ah, yes.

59:07.645 --> 59:09.311
That has been very high
on the priority list all day.

59:09.413 --> 59:12.114
Well, it wouldn't be christmas
without christmas cookies.

59:12.216 --> 59:13.949
You know, I should build
a house of christmas cookies.

59:14.051 --> 59:16.218
Only if I can live in it.

59:16.320 --> 59:17.986
Which one
are you working on here?

59:18.088 --> 59:19.888
This is the house
of mistletoe.

59:19.990 --> 59:21.990
We're gonna hang sprigs of it
all along the roof line here

59:22.092 --> 59:23.659
and along
all the other houses

59:23.761 --> 59:25.127
and when people come in
to take a look--

59:25.229 --> 59:27.829
very sneaky.

59:27.932 --> 59:29.331
I like to think of it
as romantic.

59:29.433 --> 59:31.833
That too.

59:33.804 --> 59:35.370
So, how's
the pageant rehearsal going?

59:35.472 --> 59:39.508
It's, uh, going good.
I think.

59:39.610 --> 59:41.710
I hope.
(chuckling)

59:41.812 --> 59:43.312
honestly, back in new york,

59:43.414 --> 59:46.181
I can juggle dozens
of product lines and toys

59:46.283 --> 59:48.550
all at the same time.
No problem.

59:48.652 --> 59:51.053
But here, I'm having a hard time
deciding whether "silent night"

59:51.155 --> 59:52.821
should come before or after
"joy to the world".

59:52.923 --> 59:56.158
Well, sure. I mean, that is
a very important decision.

59:56.260 --> 59:57.993
It could make or break
this entire pageant.

59:58.095 --> 1:00:00.062
(chuckling)
I know you're kidding,

1:00:00.164 --> 1:00:02.164
but that's actually not far
from where my head is at.

1:00:02.266 --> 1:00:05.000
Between this and the shop,
like--

1:00:05.102 --> 1:00:06.668
you didn't think
it would sell?

1:00:06.770 --> 1:00:09.571
No, I did, I just didn't think
it would happen so fast.

1:00:09.673 --> 1:00:11.907
Aw, well,
you having second thoughts?

1:00:12.009 --> 1:00:15.944
No. I mean, it's--
it's the right thing.

1:00:16.046 --> 1:00:17.613
Well, that doesn't mean
it isn't hard.

1:00:17.715 --> 1:00:20.015
It's kind of like saying goodbye
to your childhood.

1:00:20.117 --> 1:00:21.917
Yeah, and I thought
I was ready to do that

1:00:22.019 --> 1:00:25.020
and then I came back here and
I saw the shop and this town.

1:00:26.757 --> 1:00:28.924
I guess I didn't realize
how much I've missed it.

1:00:29.026 --> 1:00:31.360
So, it's mostly about the town?

1:00:31.462 --> 1:00:33.895
Well, and the people in it,
of course.

1:00:34.865 --> 1:00:36.932
Of course.

1:00:39.203 --> 1:00:41.536
Well, uh,
I should probably go get jess

1:00:41.639 --> 1:00:43.305
so we can get started baking.

1:00:43.407 --> 1:00:44.873
You cannot leave
christmas cookies waiting.

1:00:44.975 --> 1:00:46.108
- Nope.
- (chuckling) okay.

1:00:46.210 --> 1:00:50.479
Ooh. Do you, uh...
Wanna join us?

1:00:50.581 --> 1:00:54.383
- Yeah. I'd like that.
- Yeah?

1:00:54.485 --> 1:00:56.051
- Okay, I'll go get jessie.
- Yeah.

1:01:03.794 --> 1:01:05.861
So, what do you think
of my snowmen?

1:01:05.963 --> 1:01:07.796
They look great, jess.

1:01:07.898 --> 1:01:08.797
So, jessie,

1:01:08.899 --> 1:01:10.232
the pageant's in a few days.

1:01:10.334 --> 1:01:11.366
How you feelin'
about your song?

1:01:11.468 --> 1:01:13.802
Good, thanks to you.

1:01:13.904 --> 1:01:15.404
And santa.

1:01:15.506 --> 1:01:17.205
Oh, I think you deserve
all the credit.

1:01:17.307 --> 1:01:19.574
Getting a solo your first time
in the pageant.

1:01:19.677 --> 1:01:21.343
You should be
really proud of yourself.

1:01:21.445 --> 1:01:24.246
I know I am.
- So am I.

1:01:24.348 --> 1:01:27.683
Okay, but I still think it was
santa who helped me be brave.

1:01:27.785 --> 1:01:30.085
Well, maybe we should all
get one of those.

1:01:30.187 --> 1:01:31.987
Good idea, dad!

1:01:32.089 --> 1:01:33.822
Maybe anne can make you
a new one.

1:01:33.924 --> 1:01:35.390
She said she was thinking
about making more.

1:01:35.492 --> 1:01:37.192
Yeah, I did say that,

1:01:37.294 --> 1:01:39.695
but I think it would take a lot
to get me back in the wood shop.

1:01:39.797 --> 1:01:42.764
Take a lot how?

1:01:42.866 --> 1:01:46.835
Well, I'd really only do it
for someone I cared about.

1:01:46.937 --> 1:01:50.405
I mean, cared that they
really needed one.

1:01:50.507 --> 1:01:55.010
Well, dad always says anything's
possible at christmas.

Um, can I speak to you
for a moment?

1:02:42.392 --> 1:02:43.558
Of course.

1:02:43.660 --> 1:02:44.960
Just finishing up
a few things

1:02:45.062 --> 1:02:46.628
before we shut down
for the holidays.

1:02:46.730 --> 1:02:47.896
Yes, about that.

1:02:47.998 --> 1:02:49.998
(sighing)

1:02:50.100 --> 1:02:52.100
once we've gotten past
the holidays,

1:02:52.202 --> 1:02:53.802
I've decided to accept
the offer on the mill.

1:02:56.740 --> 1:02:59.508
I know that's not the news
you were hoping to hear.

1:02:59.610 --> 1:03:00.509
No,

1:03:00.611 --> 1:03:03.512
but, uh, I understand.

1:03:03.614 --> 1:03:05.313
I doubt to the rest
of the town will.

1:03:05.415 --> 1:03:06.314
They're good people,

1:03:06.416 --> 1:03:08.250
and you know, resilient.

1:03:08.352 --> 1:03:09.818
I'm sure they'll find a way
to bounce back.

1:03:09.920 --> 1:03:11.920
By the time the deal closes,

1:03:12.022 --> 1:03:14.422
people will have figured out
a way to move on.

1:03:14.525 --> 1:03:16.758
Well, I hope you're right.

1:03:16.860 --> 1:03:18.794
(sighing)
so, can we go to my office,

1:03:18.896 --> 1:03:20.595
go over the details, and then
we'll talk to the staff?

1:03:20.697 --> 1:03:22.430
Okay, yeah.

1:03:22.533 --> 1:03:23.965
You go ahead.
I'll be right there.

1:03:24.067 --> 1:03:25.300
Okay.

1:03:27.337 --> 1:03:29.037
(sighing)

1:03:32.843 --> 1:03:35.043
(phone ringing internally)

1:03:35.145 --> 1:03:38.113
john? Keith mclean.

1:03:38.215 --> 1:03:41.116
Uh, I really appreciate
your patience on the job offer.

1:03:43.387 --> 1:03:46.021
Well, um,
I wanted to find out

1:03:46.123 --> 1:03:48.456
if there were
other positions available.

1:03:48.559 --> 1:03:51.059
Yeah. We're shutting down
the mill here

1:03:51.161 --> 1:03:53.461
and I'd like to help out
as many people as I can.

1:03:55.132 --> 1:03:56.731
Mm-hm.

1:03:59.203 --> 1:04:02.204
Colleen:
I really wish she would have
waited until after christmas.

1:04:02.306 --> 1:04:05.540
You know, she's just working out
the details of the deal.

1:04:05.642 --> 1:04:08.176
She wanted to give everyone
as much notice as possible.

1:04:08.278 --> 1:04:09.544
It's still gonna
put a damper on things.

1:04:09.646 --> 1:04:11.213
The pageant
is tomorrow night.

1:04:11.315 --> 1:04:12.981
I'm not sure people are gonna
feel like celebrating.

1:04:13.083 --> 1:04:14.516
Okay, well then we're just
gonna have to put on

1:04:14.618 --> 1:04:16.351
a little extra christmas cheer,
okay?

1:04:16.453 --> 1:04:17.519
Merry and bright.

1:04:17.621 --> 1:04:19.221
And all that stuff.

1:04:19.323 --> 1:04:20.822
You're right.
It's times like this

1:04:20.924 --> 1:04:22.224
that people need christmas
more than ever, right?

1:04:22.326 --> 1:04:23.692
Right.

1:04:23.794 --> 1:04:25.360
I'm sure
it'll all work out fine.

1:04:27.264 --> 1:04:30.031
Merry christmas to you.

1:04:32.603 --> 1:04:34.903
(chuckling)

1:04:35.005 --> 1:04:37.572
mrs. Wentzell,
what a lovely surprise!

1:04:37.674 --> 1:04:40.575
Mr. Garrison,
just the man I was looking for.

1:04:40.677 --> 1:04:43.745
I want to buy
something else

1:04:43.847 --> 1:04:45.413
for my grandniece
for christmas.

1:04:45.515 --> 1:04:47.782
Ah!

1:04:47.885 --> 1:04:50.552
I have just the thing
for you.

1:04:50.654 --> 1:04:52.721
My annie had one when she
was that age and she loved it.

1:04:52.823 --> 1:04:54.689
Oh.

1:04:54.791 --> 1:04:58.026
That's just perfect.

1:04:58.128 --> 1:04:59.461
I don't suppose
you could have it shipped?

1:04:59.563 --> 1:05:01.396
Not a problem at all.

1:05:01.498 --> 1:05:04.366
I knew
I could depend on you.

1:05:04.468 --> 1:05:06.768
Well, for this
last christmas here.

1:05:07.938 --> 1:05:10.438
Yes!

1:05:10.540 --> 1:05:12.741
I don't know what the town's
going to do with you.

1:05:12.843 --> 1:05:15.277
Will you miss it?

1:05:15.379 --> 1:05:16.778
Absolutely.

1:05:16.880 --> 1:05:18.980
But, I mean,
you can relate to that, right?

1:05:19.082 --> 1:05:20.315
I heard about the mill.

1:05:20.417 --> 1:05:22.617
You're gonna miss it too,
won't you?

1:05:22.719 --> 1:05:25.220
Yes. I will.

1:05:25.322 --> 1:05:27.822
It was originally
my husband's passion.

1:05:27.925 --> 1:05:29.658
When he died,
I didn't know anything

1:05:29.760 --> 1:05:31.993
about running a business
but I kept at it.

1:05:33.063 --> 1:05:34.296
It took time,

1:05:34.398 --> 1:05:36.631
but in the end
I made that mill my own.

1:05:36.733 --> 1:05:38.800
It's tough to let that go,
isn't it?

1:05:38.902 --> 1:05:41.303
Well, like you say,
it's time.

1:05:41.405 --> 1:05:43.471
Well, we're not getting
any younger, are we?

1:05:43.573 --> 1:05:44.973
Oh, speak for yourself.

1:05:45.075 --> 1:05:46.241
(laughing)

1:05:46.343 --> 1:05:47.509
oh!

1:05:47.611 --> 1:05:49.244
I have something for you.
- Oh.

1:05:49.346 --> 1:05:53.148
Um...Ah, yeah. Yeah.

1:05:53.250 --> 1:05:54.950
For you.

1:05:57.821 --> 1:06:01.656
"I am the santa
of years yet to come,

1:06:01.758 --> 1:06:05.026
"looking to the future and
all the christmases ahead."

1:06:07.497 --> 1:06:08.530
that's beautiful!

1:06:08.632 --> 1:06:09.864
Thank you.

1:06:09.967 --> 1:06:11.166
You're welcome.

1:06:11.268 --> 1:06:13.935
And merry christmas,
mr. Garrison.

1:06:14.037 --> 1:06:15.937
And to you as well,
mrs. Wentzell.

1:06:17.874 --> 1:06:19.140
Georgina:
Hey, keith!

1:06:19.242 --> 1:06:20.375
Hey.

1:06:20.477 --> 1:06:22.811
Hey.
I'm glad I caught you.

1:06:22.913 --> 1:06:24.479
I just wanted to thank you
for thinking of me

1:06:24.581 --> 1:06:25.714
for that job
at the mill in vermont.

1:06:25.816 --> 1:06:27.215
No need to thank me.

1:06:27.317 --> 1:06:28.717
It was up to me,
there'd be a job for everybody.

1:06:28.819 --> 1:06:31.119
I'm just sorry
they're making you come with us

1:06:31.221 --> 1:06:33.188
to the interviews tomorrow!

1:06:33.290 --> 1:06:34.956
I mean,
you already got the job.

1:06:35.058 --> 1:06:37.058
Well, they just want my input
on the new candidates.

1:06:37.160 --> 1:06:38.493
I just wish
they wouldn't have insisted

1:06:38.595 --> 1:06:40.395
on doing it on christmas eve.

1:06:40.497 --> 1:06:42.464
Mrs. Wentzell may not be
mrs. Claus, but, uh,

1:06:42.566 --> 1:06:44.132
she wouldn't do
something like that.

1:06:44.234 --> 1:06:47.469
Well, you gotta do what
you gotta do to get the job.

1:06:47.571 --> 1:06:49.637
We'll just go and be back
in time to hear jessie sing.

1:06:49.740 --> 1:06:52.974
We absolutely need
to be back for that.

1:06:53.076 --> 1:06:54.709
So, what did anne say
about all this?

1:06:56.546 --> 1:06:57.712
Haven't told her yet.

1:06:57.814 --> 1:06:59.681
Why not?

1:06:59.783 --> 1:07:01.850
Just, with everything going on,
I just haven't had it.

1:07:01.952 --> 1:07:04.753
Oh. Okay.

1:07:04.855 --> 1:07:07.088
I thought it was because
you didn't want to tell her

1:07:07.190 --> 1:07:08.590
that you were taking a job
in another state.

1:07:08.692 --> 1:07:10.425
She's heading back
to new york,

1:07:10.527 --> 1:07:12.594
her father's moving
to connecticut. It just--

1:07:12.696 --> 1:07:15.230
it doesn't make a difference
whether I stay or not.

1:07:15.332 --> 1:07:17.699
Then I don't think there's
any reason not to tell her.

1:07:17.801 --> 1:07:19.334
Right?

1:07:34.785 --> 1:07:36.684
Hey. How's it going
with the pageant?

1:07:36.787 --> 1:07:38.953
Uh, it's uh,
it's a bit of a challenge.

1:07:39.056 --> 1:07:40.555
Everyone's worried
about what's gonna happen

1:07:40.657 --> 1:07:41.923
after the mill closes.

1:07:42.025 --> 1:07:44.359
Ah. (sighing)
anything I can do?

1:07:44.461 --> 1:07:45.760
Mmm, talk mrs. Wentzell
out of selling?

1:07:45.862 --> 1:07:47.195
(chuckling)
yeah.

1:07:47.297 --> 1:07:50.098
Well, you know,
they are still negotiating,

1:07:50.200 --> 1:07:52.700
so it wouldn't be official
until after the holidays,

1:07:52.803 --> 1:07:55.303
but unless someone comes in
with a better offer,

1:07:55.405 --> 1:07:57.305
I think it's a done deal.

1:07:57.407 --> 1:07:59.641
I don't suppose
we're gonna make enough money

1:07:59.743 --> 1:08:02.110
off selling the store
to be able to buy the mill?

1:08:02.212 --> 1:08:04.646
I don't think so?
(chuckling)

1:08:04.748 --> 1:08:07.449
but would you do that
if there was?

1:08:07.551 --> 1:08:09.551
You know, I'm uh,

1:08:09.653 --> 1:08:11.886
I'm not happy about what
it's gonna do to the town,

1:08:11.988 --> 1:08:15.090
but it's really just
wishful thinking.

1:08:15.192 --> 1:08:18.893
Well, maybe there's a reason
besides the mill and the store

1:08:18.995 --> 1:08:21.096
that you'd want to stay for.

1:08:22.966 --> 1:08:25.100
(bashful chuckling)

1:08:25.202 --> 1:08:27.735
yeah, you, uh,
you may be right.

1:08:29.206 --> 1:08:31.106
But it's not me, is it?

1:08:31.208 --> 1:08:33.842
Tom.

1:08:37.681 --> 1:08:47.455
♪

1:08:53.029 --> 1:08:55.663
oh, um, you know,

1:08:55.765 --> 1:09:00.201
that other reason that you
might stay in north bay for?

1:09:00.303 --> 1:09:02.036
Maybe you shouldn't
let it slip away.

1:09:02.139 --> 1:09:06.007
Whatever or whoever it is?

1:09:14.551 --> 1:09:16.217
Colleen:
I really need you to take
my shift tomorrow, joanne.

1:09:16.319 --> 1:09:19.454
'cause keith is going out of
town and I need to watch jessie.

1:09:19.556 --> 1:09:20.488
(knocking at door)

1:09:20.590 --> 1:09:22.724
hold on.
Come on in!

1:09:22.826 --> 1:09:24.159
Someone's out the door.
Just give me a sec.

1:09:24.261 --> 1:09:25.660
Hi!
- Hey!

1:09:25.762 --> 1:09:27.128
- Oh, I'm sorry, are you on--
- that's okay.

1:09:27.230 --> 1:09:28.730
Um, is keith here?

1:09:28.832 --> 1:09:30.165
No. He went to the office
to pick up some stuff

1:09:30.267 --> 1:09:31.666
to present at the mill
in vermont tomorrow.

1:09:31.768 --> 1:09:33.434
Vermont?

1:09:33.537 --> 1:09:35.336
He's been offered
a job there.

1:09:35.438 --> 1:09:37.639
And he's going tomorrow?

1:09:37.741 --> 1:09:39.674
Just to talk to them about
other positions for his people.

1:09:40.977 --> 1:09:42.410
- But he's moving away?
- You know what?

1:09:42.512 --> 1:09:44.579
Let me just finish
getting my shift covered.

1:09:44.681 --> 1:09:46.080
I'll be right back.

1:10:09.773 --> 1:10:11.773
Do you want to keep this?

1:10:12.909 --> 1:10:14.175
Huh!

1:10:18.014 --> 1:10:20.315
I carved this train for you
when you were three years old.

1:10:20.417 --> 1:10:23.451
I know.

1:10:23.553 --> 1:10:25.954
I used to love
playing with it.

1:10:26.056 --> 1:10:27.522
I would always dream
that I was on it

1:10:27.624 --> 1:10:29.657
and it was taking me
to my very own castle.

1:10:29.759 --> 1:10:33.027
Mmm.
With a handsome prince?

1:10:33.129 --> 1:10:35.496
Dad, I was three!
(laughing)

1:10:35.599 --> 1:10:37.632
the only thing I cared about
was the castle.

1:10:37.734 --> 1:10:39.067
And the horses and the stable,
of course.

1:10:39.169 --> 1:10:40.168
Of course.

1:10:40.270 --> 1:10:43.304
Well, um, it's yours.

1:10:43.406 --> 1:10:45.173
You can decide
what you want to do with it.

1:10:46.910 --> 1:10:48.643
I'll think about it.

1:10:49.913 --> 1:10:51.646
Okay.

1:10:51.748 --> 1:10:53.214
(chuckling)

1:10:53.316 --> 1:10:54.882
you know, it's--

1:10:54.985 --> 1:10:57.552
it's been really quiet
around here without jessie.

1:10:57.654 --> 1:11:01.589
Yeah. I guess it is.

1:11:01.691 --> 1:11:05.260
Have you, um--
have you talked to keith?

1:11:05.362 --> 1:11:06.261
About what?

1:11:06.363 --> 1:11:08.529
Well, I don't know.

1:11:08.632 --> 1:11:11.199
Him possibly moving
to another state,

1:11:11.301 --> 1:11:14.736
uh, you living in new york?

1:11:14.838 --> 1:11:17.505
Well, that was gonna happen
regardless.

1:11:17.607 --> 1:11:21.442
And besides, he's already left
to help with an interview, so.

1:11:21.544 --> 1:11:23.444
Ah.

1:11:23.546 --> 1:11:25.380
Well, maybe when
he gets back, huh?

1:11:27.017 --> 1:11:29.117
Yeah. Maybe.

1:11:35.925 --> 1:11:37.792
Are you ready?

1:11:37.894 --> 1:11:40.395
Ready as I'll ever be.

1:11:40.497 --> 1:11:42.363
You seem less than enthused
about this.

1:11:42.465 --> 1:11:44.132
You need to work on that
before we get there.

1:11:44.234 --> 1:11:47.568
I will, I just need a little
time to psych myself up for it.

1:11:47.671 --> 1:11:49.304
These are good jobs, keith.

1:11:49.406 --> 1:11:50.972
I know, and I'm grateful

1:11:51.074 --> 1:11:54.442
that there's potential jobs
for everyone. I just--

1:11:54.544 --> 1:11:56.811
there's gotta be
something more we can do here.

1:11:56.913 --> 1:11:58.212
Like what?

1:11:59.616 --> 1:12:00.882
I wanna save the mill.

1:12:00.984 --> 1:12:02.917
How?

1:12:03.019 --> 1:12:04.719
You have some secret inheritance
laying around

1:12:04.821 --> 1:12:05.753
that I don't know about?

1:12:05.855 --> 1:12:09.457
Unfortunately, no.

1:12:09.559 --> 1:12:12.927
I get why this is
important to you.

1:12:13.029 --> 1:12:14.929
But is it really
just about the jobs,

1:12:15.031 --> 1:12:16.798
or is there
something more to it?

1:12:19.069 --> 1:12:21.002
Look, it's not just
about the jobs, okay?

1:12:21.104 --> 1:12:22.403
It's about the people.

1:12:22.505 --> 1:12:25.673
It's about the town
and it's about...

1:12:25.775 --> 1:12:28.009
There must be
some other way.

1:12:28.111 --> 1:12:30.912
Well, if there was,

1:12:31.014 --> 1:12:32.580
someone would have done it
by now.

1:12:34.818 --> 1:12:37.151
We have got to hit the road.

1:12:37.253 --> 1:12:38.486
Okay.

1:12:38.588 --> 1:12:40.822
Um, just give me one minute,
okay?

1:12:45.395 --> 1:12:46.494
Hey, kiddo.

1:12:46.596 --> 1:12:47.762
I thought you were leaving.

1:12:47.864 --> 1:12:50.031
I am.
I just wanted to, um--

1:12:50.133 --> 1:12:54.001
you'll be back in time
for the pageant though, right?

1:12:54.104 --> 1:12:57.805
Absolutely.

1:12:57.907 --> 1:12:59.040
You're gonna be great,
you know.

1:12:59.142 --> 1:13:00.608
I hope so.

1:13:00.710 --> 1:13:02.210
I know so.

1:13:02.312 --> 1:13:04.178
Come on. Give me a hug.

1:13:05.181 --> 1:13:06.547
(sighing)

1:13:09.085 --> 1:13:10.885
be good for aunt patty?

1:13:12.288 --> 1:13:13.488
I love you.

1:13:13.590 --> 1:13:15.790
I love you too, dad.

1:13:20.964 --> 1:13:22.697
(sighing)

1:13:31.641 --> 1:13:41.516
♪

1:13:46.890 --> 1:13:48.856
I saved you guys some seats
right up in the front row.

1:13:50.960 --> 1:13:52.593
I'm so proud of you.

1:13:55.131 --> 1:13:56.831
- Break a leg.
- Thank you!

1:13:59.602 --> 1:14:01.002
It's like the whole town
turned out.

1:14:01.104 --> 1:14:02.537
I know!

1:14:02.639 --> 1:14:04.539
And I was worried
no one was going to show up.

1:14:04.641 --> 1:14:06.507
I guess ultimately
everybody decided they needed

1:14:06.609 --> 1:14:08.276
a little christmas spirit
to cheer them up after all.

1:14:08.378 --> 1:14:11.245
Right, no pressure.
(chuckling)

1:14:11.347 --> 1:14:12.246
listen,
have you seen keith?

1:14:12.348 --> 1:14:13.848
I haven't seen him.

1:14:13.950 --> 1:14:15.616
But we should get started.

1:14:15.718 --> 1:14:17.919
Okay. It's gonna be great!
- Okay.

1:14:18.021 --> 1:14:19.287
(giggling)

1:14:19.389 --> 1:14:21.422
(exhaling)

1:14:23.126 --> 1:14:24.692
(humming warm-up)

1:14:24.794 --> 1:14:26.060
okay, the choir's almost done.

1:14:26.162 --> 1:14:27.862
Quartet, take your places.
You're up next.

1:14:27.964 --> 1:14:30.465
And don't forget
to smile and have fun.

1:14:30.567 --> 1:14:32.200
It's christmas!

1:14:32.302 --> 1:14:33.601
Okay.

1:14:35.839 --> 1:14:38.773
Hi, jesse.

1:14:38.875 --> 1:14:40.241
You're up next. Are you okay?

1:14:40.343 --> 1:14:41.776
I think so.

1:14:41.878 --> 1:14:43.644
But I have super santa here,
just in case.

1:14:45.148 --> 1:14:49.116
Did I ever tell you
why I made those?

1:14:49.219 --> 1:14:50.618
I was gonna give them out
as christmas gifts

1:14:50.720 --> 1:14:52.487
because I wanted
the people I cared about

1:14:52.589 --> 1:14:53.754
to get something meaningful.

1:14:53.857 --> 1:14:56.224
So then,
why'd you keep them?

1:14:56.326 --> 1:14:57.925
Because I went off
to college in new york

1:14:58.027 --> 1:15:00.728
and I saw this big city

1:15:00.830 --> 1:15:03.498
and I met all these new people
and it was wonderful

1:15:03.600 --> 1:15:06.167
and exciting,
and I don't regret any of it.

1:15:06.269 --> 1:15:08.836
But, it may me forget
about some of the things

1:15:08.938 --> 1:15:10.238
that are important to me.

1:15:11.374 --> 1:15:13.474
- Like your santas.
- Yeah.

1:15:13.576 --> 1:15:16.477
I thought they were just
part of my childhood.

1:15:16.579 --> 1:15:19.146
Just fanciful things
I made when I was a kid,

1:15:19.249 --> 1:15:22.083
and that's they wouldn't
mean anything to anyone.

1:15:22.185 --> 1:15:25.019
- They meant something to me.
- I know.

1:15:25.121 --> 1:15:26.754
And you helped me realize

1:15:26.856 --> 1:15:29.590
that they still
mean something to me too.

1:15:31.828 --> 1:15:32.994
And it's just like
you're saying.

1:15:33.096 --> 1:15:34.829
It's meaningful to you

1:15:34.931 --> 1:15:38.499
and to everyone who's gonna get
to hear your beautiful voice.

1:15:40.670 --> 1:15:43.271
Have a great pageant, okay?
Be brave.

I hope everyone's enjoying

1:17:57.473 --> 1:17:58.639
That was really wonderful,
jessie.

1:17:58.741 --> 1:18:00.708
(chuckling)

1:18:00.810 --> 1:18:03.444
as you know, I am retiring.

1:18:03.546 --> 1:18:04.812
I have not changed
my mind about that.

1:18:07.116 --> 1:18:09.884
But I have changed my mind
about selling the mill.

1:18:09.986 --> 1:18:11.719
This was never
about money to me.

1:18:11.821 --> 1:18:16.323
This was about moving closer
to my brother and his family

1:18:16.426 --> 1:18:17.825
and enjoying my golden years.

1:18:17.927 --> 1:18:20.561
(chuckling)

1:18:20.663 --> 1:18:22.196
I never wanted
to close the mill

1:18:22.298 --> 1:18:26.167
but I didn't think
there was any choice.

1:18:26.269 --> 1:18:28.335
Until today. Keith?

1:18:29.772 --> 1:18:31.505
(whispering)
great job, sweetie.

1:18:33.142 --> 1:18:36.711
Thank you, dorothy.
(clearing throat)

1:18:36.813 --> 1:18:41.382
ever since I found out
that mrs. Wentzell was retiring

1:18:41.484 --> 1:18:43.584
and considering
selling the mill,

1:18:43.686 --> 1:18:47.421
I've been trying to figure out
a way to save it.

1:18:50.393 --> 1:18:54.228
It took me receiving
a very special christmas gift

1:18:54.330 --> 1:18:56.931
to come up with an idea.

1:18:58.735 --> 1:19:00.201
Is that
one of your santas?

1:19:00.303 --> 1:19:01.535
Yeah, it is.

1:19:04.107 --> 1:19:05.706
I'd like to read
what it says.

1:19:07.744 --> 1:19:10.444
"I am the santa of love.

1:19:10.546 --> 1:19:14.081
"because at christmas
and all year round,

1:19:14.183 --> 1:19:16.350
"there is no greater gift
than love."

1:19:19.589 --> 1:19:23.224
I would like to say that
this little guy inspired me,

1:19:23.326 --> 1:19:25.059
but it's about more

1:19:25.161 --> 1:19:29.930
than just a wonderfully carved
figurine and a card.

1:19:30.032 --> 1:19:32.700
It's about where it came from,

1:19:32.802 --> 1:19:34.401
who it came from.

1:19:36.439 --> 1:19:40.407
And how much it meant that
she was willing to make it.

1:19:40.510 --> 1:19:42.877
For me.

1:19:42.979 --> 1:19:46.080
So I was thinking
about all that,

1:19:46.182 --> 1:19:47.481
and an idea came to me.

1:19:48.985 --> 1:19:50.451
Dorothy?

1:19:52.555 --> 1:19:55.790
I thought that because
I had no family here

1:19:55.892 --> 1:19:57.892
that was interested
in running the mill,

1:19:57.994 --> 1:20:01.295
that I had to close it down...

1:20:01.397 --> 1:20:02.663
Until keith helps me realize

1:20:02.765 --> 1:20:05.733
that I do have family here.

1:20:05.835 --> 1:20:07.802
All of you.

1:20:07.904 --> 1:20:09.503
(crowd murmuring)

1:20:09.605 --> 1:20:12.339
so, I'm giving the mill
to the town.

1:20:12.441 --> 1:20:13.641
(gasping in shock)

1:20:13.743 --> 1:20:15.176
and keith is going to be
in charge

1:20:15.278 --> 1:20:19.313
of making sure it runs
for a long, long time.

1:20:19.415 --> 1:20:24.084
(cheering)

1:20:29.559 --> 1:20:30.858
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

1:20:35.331 --> 1:20:36.330
Dad. Dad!

1:20:36.432 --> 1:20:37.364
Come with me.

1:20:37.466 --> 1:20:39.099
What?

1:20:42.738 --> 1:20:44.605
Sweetie.
(chuckling) sweetie!

1:20:44.707 --> 1:20:46.106
What's up?

1:20:46.209 --> 1:20:47.675
Sell the store to me.

1:20:47.777 --> 1:20:48.776
What?

1:20:48.878 --> 1:20:49.777
I'll take it over.

1:20:49.879 --> 1:20:51.478
I'll run it.

1:20:51.581 --> 1:20:53.214
You can spend half the year
in connecticut with lisa

1:20:53.316 --> 1:20:54.982
and the other half
here with me.

1:20:55.084 --> 1:20:56.517
Maybe you can help me out
at christmas.

1:20:56.619 --> 1:21:00.020
What about your job,
your life in new york?

1:21:00.122 --> 1:21:02.523
I think I'm ready
to come home.

1:21:03.893 --> 1:21:05.359
What do you say?

1:21:05.461 --> 1:21:07.561
- Yeah!
- (giggling)

1:21:07.663 --> 1:21:08.629
(laughing)
yeah!

1:21:08.731 --> 1:21:10.531
(both laughing)

1:21:13.202 --> 1:21:14.835
oh. Uh,

1:21:14.937 --> 1:21:16.237
I almost forgot.

1:21:16.339 --> 1:21:17.805
I was going to give this
to you later, but--

1:21:19.609 --> 1:21:21.475
my reindeer!

1:21:21.577 --> 1:21:23.177
I can't believe you found him!

1:21:23.279 --> 1:21:26.547
Maybe you could carve a few more
and keep him company, huh?

1:21:26.649 --> 1:21:28.549
(chuckling)

1:21:28.651 --> 1:21:31.085
ah.

1:21:31.187 --> 1:21:32.353
I'll give you guys a minute.

1:21:32.455 --> 1:21:33.687
Okay.

1:21:41.464 --> 1:21:43.430
You ran out
without your coat.

1:21:43.532 --> 1:21:45.399
Thanks. It's freezing.

1:21:49.171 --> 1:21:50.905
That was, um,
quite the speech.

1:21:51.007 --> 1:21:52.940
Yeah?
It felt a little long.

1:21:53.042 --> 1:21:53.941
Nope.

1:21:54.043 --> 1:21:55.743
Just perfect.

1:21:57.513 --> 1:21:58.846
So you got the santa, huh?

1:21:58.948 --> 1:22:01.782
Yeah, I did.

1:22:01.884 --> 1:22:03.951
Now you can put it
next to jessie's.

1:22:04.053 --> 1:22:07.755
I think I got a--
better place for it.

1:22:07.857 --> 1:22:10.791
I can put 'em both in the
house of the wooden santas.

1:22:15.631 --> 1:22:18.265
I don't know what to say.

1:22:19.969 --> 1:22:22.369
Say you'll stay.

1:22:22.471 --> 1:22:24.104
I know you and tom--

1:22:24.206 --> 1:22:25.372
tom.

1:22:25.474 --> 1:22:27.808
(scoffing)
tom is just a friend.

1:22:28.844 --> 1:22:30.544
A good friend,

1:22:30.646 --> 1:22:32.713
but the santa of love
is the first thing I've carved

1:22:32.815 --> 1:22:34.648
since I was a kid.

1:22:34.750 --> 1:22:36.650
And I didn't do that
for tom.

1:22:37.820 --> 1:22:39.119
I did that for you.

1:22:42.658 --> 1:22:45.592
Um...So, uh...

1:22:45.695 --> 1:22:48.662
So, um,
the mill is staying open

1:22:48.764 --> 1:22:51.098
so I'm thinking
the toy store should too.

1:22:53.336 --> 1:22:54.735
(chuckling)

1:22:54.837 --> 1:22:56.136
well--
(clearing throat)

1:22:56.238 --> 1:22:59.139
this town definitely needs
a toy store.

1:23:02.244 --> 1:23:04.178
Merry christmas, anne.

1:23:05.648 --> 1:23:07.348
Merry christmas, keith.
