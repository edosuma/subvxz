00:00.500 --> 00:01.667
Your pony was injured?

00:02.367 --> 00:05.567
And the dog lunged at the horse
and grabbed on to her nose.

00:05.834 --> 00:08.533
Did you have control of your dogs?

00:09.166 --> 00:11.233
-Um--
-Um...

00:11.300 --> 00:14.066
You're embarrassing yourself
in front of your child.

00:40.300 --> 00:43.200
[Kevin] All rise!
Court come to order!

00:49.600 --> 00:51.533
Hello, Judge. We have case number 1018.

00:51.600 --> 00:52.834
Mielke vs. Larranaga.

00:52.900 --> 00:54.400
Thank you. Be seated, please.

00:55.266 --> 00:58.633
Ms. Mielke, you and a group
of friends, family, kids,

00:58.700 --> 01:02.200
decided to take a long ride,
according to your complaint,

01:02.266 --> 01:05.100
with your horses
to some sort of a state park.

01:05.166 --> 01:07.300
Little Missouri State Park
in North Dakota.

01:07.367 --> 01:09.133
[Judy] How long a trip did you make?

01:09.200 --> 01:12.500
I believe it was three days of riding,
five days total with the travel.

01:12.567 --> 01:14.300
And on what date did you arrive?

01:14.367 --> 01:17.133
The incident was on the 30th,
so that would've been

01:17.200 --> 01:19.767
the twenty... eighth
that we arrived?

01:19.834 --> 01:21.767
Did you ride on the 29th?

01:21.834 --> 01:24.100
Correct. Yep. We rode for two days
prior to the incident.

01:24.166 --> 01:26.133
[Judy] So you actually
rode your horses.

01:26.200 --> 01:27.900
How many horses were there in total?

01:27.967 --> 01:30.100
There were three horses and three ponies.

01:30.166 --> 01:31.700
-How many people?
-Um...

01:31.767 --> 01:33.567
Two adults, six children.

01:33.633 --> 01:37.200
So some people,
some kids rode along with a parent.

01:37.266 --> 01:40.600
Correct. Yeah, my daughter
rode behind me on my horse.

01:40.667 --> 01:44.166
Elayna had her son behind her
on her horse,

01:44.233 --> 01:49.000
and also her younger child
on the front in a-- one of those carry...

01:49.066 --> 01:51.367
And the other two rode ponies separately.

01:51.433 --> 01:53.934
The first day that you rode,
did you have a pleasant day?

01:54.000 --> 01:55.734
Yeah, the first day was pleasant.

01:55.800 --> 01:57.033
[Judy] You rode in the park?

01:57.100 --> 01:58.100
Correct. Yup.

01:58.166 --> 02:00.200
Had you seen other people in the park?

02:00.266 --> 02:01.333
Correct. Yes.

02:01.400 --> 02:02.800
-[Judy] Were there other people?
-Yes.

02:02.867 --> 02:04.734
-[Judy] Had any difficulty?
-[Amber] No.

02:04.800 --> 02:06.467
[Judy] How many hours
a day did you ride?

02:06.533 --> 02:09.767
We typically go on three
to four-hour rides at a time.

02:09.834 --> 02:12.266
[Judy] So three to four hours
the first day you arrived

02:12.333 --> 02:14.467
and three to four hours
the second day you arrived.

02:14.533 --> 02:16.533
-Correct.
-And did you see other people in the park?

02:16.600 --> 02:17.467
Yes.

02:17.533 --> 02:19.066
[Judy]
Were there other animals in the park?

02:19.133 --> 02:20.567
-[Amber] Yes.
-[Judy] Horses?

02:20.633 --> 02:21.767
Horses and dogs.

02:22.700 --> 02:24.600
-Any incidents?
-No.

02:24.667 --> 02:26.266
[Judy] Now we're gonna
get to the 30th.

02:26.333 --> 02:28.033
What time of the day did you leave?

02:28.100 --> 02:30.367
I would guess around 9:30.

02:30.433 --> 02:32.300
[Judy] And what time
did this incident occur?

02:32.367 --> 02:37.200
Before noon, I would say around
11:00 or 11:30, somewhere in there.

02:37.266 --> 02:39.567
So you were riding for at least
an hour and a half.

02:39.633 --> 02:41.900
-Mm-hmm.
-[Judy] With all?

02:41.967 --> 02:44.567
Correct.
Everyone was on the ride with us.

02:44.633 --> 02:47.600
[Judy] All eight people
and all the horses.

02:48.166 --> 02:49.900
-Yes.
-[Judy] Now I want you to describe to me

02:49.967 --> 02:52.734
the incident that occurred
that brings us to court today.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.800
Okay, when we trail ride, we ride--

02:54.867 --> 02:58.734
the trails are narrow so we ride
in a line or...

02:58.800 --> 03:01.433
one at-- single file,
I guess is the best way to describe it.

03:01.500 --> 03:04.066
So, yeah, we were out on the trail riding.

03:04.133 --> 03:06.300
The younger girl that was with us
that was 13

03:06.367 --> 03:08.200
was in the lead on one of my horses.

03:08.266 --> 03:11.266
All the horses there
that weekend were mine.

03:11.333 --> 03:13.867
They're all trained by me. Um...

03:13.934 --> 03:15.867
-And don't editorialize, just tell me--
-[Amber] Sorry. Sorry.

03:15.934 --> 03:17.600
-Just tell me about the incident.
-Okay.

03:17.667 --> 03:18.734
Yeah, so...

03:18.800 --> 03:20.767
as we are riding,

03:20.834 --> 03:22.567
headed towards camp,

03:22.633 --> 03:25.300
we saw some cows off in the distance

03:25.367 --> 03:27.667
and they sounded like
they were in distress.

03:27.734 --> 03:29.467
When cows are in distress,
they're bellowing.

03:29.533 --> 03:31.400
So we heard the cows,
we saw some dogs,

03:31.467 --> 03:34.266
and we thought, well,
maybe the ranchers are just moving

03:34.333 --> 03:36.667
their cattle to another pasture.
No big deal.

03:36.734 --> 03:39.333
We're used to cows and dogs,
so no big deal.

03:39.400 --> 03:42.633
As we came over the hill,
towards where the cattle were,

03:42.700 --> 03:44.433
as-- once we came over,

03:44.500 --> 03:47.233
there was a dog
that met us at the top of the hill.

03:47.300 --> 03:49.133
And the horses stopped and kinda froze--

03:49.200 --> 03:50.200
-[Judy] Okay, one sec.
-Okay.

03:50.266 --> 03:52.066
-You're riding on a trail.
-Correct.

03:52.133 --> 03:56.734
It's a narrow trail. So the lead horse
that was being ridden by a 13-year-old...

03:56.800 --> 03:57.633
Correct.

03:57.734 --> 03:59.300
-But you could see her.
-Mm-hmm.

03:59.367 --> 04:01.633
-'Cause you were...
-I was second in line.

04:01.700 --> 04:05.100
[Judy] And when you say,
"a dog met us at the top of the hill,"

04:05.166 --> 04:06.834
was there a person with the dog?

04:06.900 --> 04:08.700
-No.
-[Judy] And what did the dog look like?

04:08.767 --> 04:10.166
[Amber] It was a husky

04:10.233 --> 04:14.133
with a curved tail,
like greyish-white in color? Um...

04:14.200 --> 04:16.266
[Judy] <i>Okay, now tell</i>
<i>me what happened.</i>

04:16.333 --> 04:19.600
Okay, so I told the girl in front, Maddie,

04:19.667 --> 04:22.333
"Just, uh, stay calm," you know,
'cause we weren't sure

04:22.400 --> 04:23.400
what the dog would do.

04:23.467 --> 04:27.100
But before anything else happened,
the dog lunged at the horse

04:27.166 --> 04:28.867
and grabbed on to her nose.

04:28.934 --> 04:32.834
And this-- So, it grabbed on to the nose.
The horse turned,

04:32.900 --> 04:37.900
out, you know, being spooked from
this and ran back down the hill.

04:37.967 --> 04:39.533
But then when that horse ran,

04:39.600 --> 04:43.033
all the other horses in turn continued,
and the dog continued chasing

04:43.100 --> 04:46.066
the horse and biting its heels,
causing it to run faster.

04:46.133 --> 04:47.934
And the horses just spooked more.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.800
Now, when the dog was running
after the lead horse,

04:52.867 --> 04:54.600
did you see a person?

04:54.667 --> 04:55.867
Not immediately.

04:55.934 --> 04:59.233
Okay. At what point did you see a person?

04:59.300 --> 05:01.967
After my horse had turned around

05:02.033 --> 05:03.834
and we were headed the other way,

05:03.900 --> 05:07.233
I could hear someone shouting
and see someone running behind me.

05:07.300 --> 05:08.900
Is that person in court today?

05:08.967 --> 05:10.300
Yes.

05:10.367 --> 05:11.266
Point.

05:12.333 --> 05:13.800
[Judy] That would be the defendant.

05:13.867 --> 05:16.100
-Mr. Larranaga.
-[Amber] Correct.

05:16.166 --> 05:20.166
-[Judy] Could you hear what he was saying?
-Yes. He said, "I'm so... sorry."

05:21.433 --> 05:22.500
The exact words.

05:22.567 --> 05:23.567
That's about right.

05:24.066 --> 05:26.567
Okay, and that's what this case is about.

05:26.633 --> 05:29.000
Your pony was injured,
you had vet bills,

05:29.066 --> 05:30.834
he was out of commission for a long time.

05:30.900 --> 05:33.834
You're gonna have to prove to me,
if I find in your favor,

05:33.900 --> 05:37.667
that the pony that was injured
was devalued because of the injury.

05:37.734 --> 05:38.734
Yes.

05:38.800 --> 05:41.533
[Judy] In any event, there was
one pony that was injured

05:41.600 --> 05:43.633
that ran into a fence.

05:43.700 --> 05:46.233
Yes, there was one pony
that was seriously injured.

05:46.300 --> 05:51.100
All the horses did receive cuts
and bruises and minor injuries.

05:51.166 --> 05:54.467
Also as a result of this,
I see from your complaint

05:54.533 --> 05:56.700
that people fell off their horses.

05:56.767 --> 05:59.100
Yes, correct.
Everyone fell off except for me.

05:59.166 --> 06:01.934
All the kids were very
traumatized by this incident.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.667
Sorry. [chuckles]

06:04.233 --> 06:06.367
-Everybody fell off the horses.
-Correct.

06:06.433 --> 06:07.533
-[Judy] Except you.
-Except me.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.667
[Judy] And the defendant was in a position

06:09.734 --> 06:11.900
to see that everybody
fell off their horses.

06:11.967 --> 06:14.533
-[Amber] Yes.
-Did he ever retrieve his dog?

06:14.600 --> 06:16.100
How did he retrieve his dog?

06:16.166 --> 06:19.700
Not until about a mile down the trail.

06:19.767 --> 06:21.934
The horses followed the way
that they had came from.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.333
They ran into a barbed-wire fence
and that's where they were cornered

06:25.400 --> 06:27.900
-and had to stop.
-[Judy] And is that where the dog was?

06:27.967 --> 06:31.467
I was not there, but when we got
to where the horses were,

06:31.533 --> 06:33.433
the defendant was there with his dogs.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.367
-[Judy] How many dogs did he have?
-Two.

06:35.433 --> 06:37.800
[Judy] Was it both that were
chasing the horses?

06:37.867 --> 06:38.834
-Yes. Yes.
-[Judy] Or just one?

06:38.900 --> 06:42.667
One that was biting, that I could see.
Both were chasing.

06:43.400 --> 06:44.633
You're on!

06:45.333 --> 06:46.433
How do I begin?

06:46.500 --> 06:48.834
Uh, well, try to begin with the truth.

06:48.900 --> 06:50.967
That's always
the easiest thing to begin with.

06:51.033 --> 06:52.900
I read her complaint, I read your answer.

06:52.967 --> 06:56.667
Now you're gonna have to convince me
about the veracity of your answer.

06:56.734 --> 06:57.700
Which I don't believe.

06:58.500 --> 06:59.900
-Um--
-Um...

06:59.967 --> 07:01.433
Would you like me to start from the top?

07:01.500 --> 07:04.066
From how our day... begins?

07:04.133 --> 07:05.433
I'm not-- I'm not interested in your day.

07:05.500 --> 07:06.633
[laughter]

07:06.700 --> 07:08.667
[dramatic music]

07:08.734 --> 07:12.066
Unless you were running very fast
and holding on to the dog,

07:12.133 --> 07:13.367
which she didn't see,

07:13.433 --> 07:14.667
then I don't believe you!

07:14.734 --> 07:17.233
What you wrote in your answer was,
what she's telling me

07:17.300 --> 07:19.200
is a complete bunch
of "who shot John."

07:23.934 --> 07:26.700
[theme music plays]

07:30.066 --> 07:34.166
[narrator] <i>Amber Mielke claims</i>
<i>DiAngelo Larranaga's off-leash dogs</i>

07:34.233 --> 07:38.100
<i>attacked her horses,</i>
<i>causing them serious injuries.</i>

07:38.166 --> 07:40.300
[Judy] Okay,
I'm interested in one thing.

07:40.367 --> 07:43.000
Did you have control of your dogs?

07:43.066 --> 07:44.233
Yes, I did.

07:44.300 --> 07:46.667
Okay, well, that's what you're
gonna have to convince me of, sir.

07:46.734 --> 07:47.667
[DiAngelo] I'm ready.

07:47.734 --> 07:51.400
Because unless you were running very fast
and holding on to the dog

07:51.467 --> 07:54.066
that met her up at the top of the ridge,

07:54.133 --> 07:56.367
holding on, which she didn't see,

07:56.433 --> 07:59.433
and was running at a heavy pace,

07:59.500 --> 08:03.567
holding on to the dog's collar
as the dog was chasing the horses,

08:03.633 --> 08:05.333
then I don't believe you!

08:05.400 --> 08:06.767
You see, and if I were to believe you,

08:06.834 --> 08:08.467
because that's what
you wrote in your answer.

08:08.533 --> 08:10.967
What you wrote in your answer was
what she's telling me

08:11.033 --> 08:13.200
is a complete bunch of "who shot John."

08:13.266 --> 08:14.967
-Which it is.
-[Judy] That-- it is.

08:15.033 --> 08:16.467
I don't believe you!

08:16.533 --> 08:18.967
-[DiAngelo] Well, it is. I had them...
-So get it together!

08:19.033 --> 08:21.600
And take a deep breath.
Take a deep breath

08:21.667 --> 08:25.900
because if you think that I think
that you and your son

08:25.967 --> 08:28.500
were out at the park
with your dogs on leashes,

08:28.567 --> 08:30.900
I'm 29 and 5'7".

08:30.967 --> 08:32.667
-[audience laughs]
-[DiAngelo and Judy chuckle]

08:32.734 --> 08:38.333
Well, my dogs were on leash
as we came through the state park.

08:38.400 --> 08:42.800
Um, we were walking over two miles
without seeing a single person.

08:42.867 --> 08:46.734
We decided to take lunch and that's when
I did let my dogs off-leash.

08:46.800 --> 08:49.734
Just say that "I let my dogs off-leash"!

08:49.800 --> 08:50.800
[DiAngelo] They were off-leash.

08:50.867 --> 08:52.567
We were taking lunch
and we were in an open field.

08:52.633 --> 08:55.133
[Judy] Okay, not-- just a second.
Not only off-leash,

08:55.200 --> 08:57.667
you had taken the leash off the dogs

08:57.734 --> 08:59.867
so that just their collars were on.

08:59.934 --> 09:02.166
-[DiAngelo] That is correct.
-[Judy] That is correct. All right.

09:02.233 --> 09:05.166
So let's not say, "We were taking lunch
and I dropped the leash,

09:05.233 --> 09:07.300
you know, and I ran after
and I grabbed the leash."

09:07.367 --> 09:09.934
You took the collar off the dog

09:10.000 --> 09:11.333
because you were having lunch

09:11.400 --> 09:14.100
so you were no longer
in control of your dog.

09:14.166 --> 09:17.367
My dogs listen and they are trained.

09:17.433 --> 09:19.800
-They are under my control.
-[Judy chuckles]

09:19.867 --> 09:21.800
Just that, no, sir.
[chuckles]

09:21.867 --> 09:24.300
Clearly not!

09:24.367 --> 09:26.100
This is not my fault.

09:26.166 --> 09:29.133
I do not know what actually
spooked her horse.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.033
I know for a fact my horse never bit her.

09:31.100 --> 09:35.166
[Judy] I don't care! Just a second.
I don't know what you know

09:35.233 --> 09:37.233
because you weren't there.

09:37.300 --> 09:39.133
-I was there. I had my dog.
-[Judy] No! You--

09:39.200 --> 09:41.033
No! You were not there.

09:41.100 --> 09:42.734
I don't believe you were there.

09:42.800 --> 09:45.166
Her horses were halfway spooked
coming up the hill.

09:45.233 --> 09:47.233
I don't know if it's because
they heard us or what,

09:47.300 --> 09:49.000
but I know for a fact my dog
did not bite her horse.

09:49.066 --> 09:53.300
[Judy] Just a second. You know,
just-- What I find fascinating is

09:53.367 --> 09:55.567
that you just get yourself into it.

09:55.633 --> 09:59.200
"Her horses were spooked before
they got to the top of the hill."

09:59.266 --> 10:00.934
How could you see that?
Just a second.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.734
Do you have X-ray vision through a hill?

10:02.800 --> 10:04.700
I mean, you're taking lunch.

10:04.767 --> 10:06.667
Your dogs are off-leash.

10:06.734 --> 10:09.400
And you're looking because
you see through a hill

10:09.467 --> 10:13.033
that her horses were spooked
before they got to the top of the hill.

10:13.100 --> 10:14.800
It wasn't much of a hill.

10:14.867 --> 10:17.333
-They-- I saw them peeking over the hill.
-[Judy stammers]

10:17.400 --> 10:18.867
-I... I...
-[Judy] Well, how high was the hill?

10:18.934 --> 10:20.500
Was the top of the hill taller than you?

10:20.567 --> 10:22.700
Not more than eight feet tall.

10:22.767 --> 10:26.000
Well, I can't see through
an eight-feet-tall hill.

10:26.600 --> 10:29.433
What I mean to say is,
as the dogs crested over--

10:29.500 --> 10:32.767
or the horses crested over the hill,
that's when they became spooked.

10:32.834 --> 10:34.667
I don't know if there was
a snake in the bush--

10:34.734 --> 10:36.667
I don't know if there was
something else there.

10:36.734 --> 10:38.500
I don't care what you think.

10:38.567 --> 10:40.667
She was the second person in line.

10:40.734 --> 10:43.867
She saw what happened.
You did not see what happened.

10:43.934 --> 10:45.734
So did I. I had my dogs right there by me.

10:45.800 --> 10:48.934
No, I don't believe you.
Sir, I don't believe you.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.200
And I would suggest that--
This is your son?

10:51.266 --> 10:52.166
Yeah.

10:52.233 --> 10:54.066
And I would suggest that
you not put him up on the stand.

10:54.133 --> 10:58.500
He's already heard his father tell a fib
and I don't want to put your son,

10:58.567 --> 11:02.033
your young son, in a position
where he's gonna do what you just did,

11:02.100 --> 11:03.166
which is tell a fib.

11:03.233 --> 11:04.934
-I'm not fibbing--
-[Judy] Which is tell a-- Oh, yes, you--

11:05.000 --> 11:06.400
Oh, absolutely.

11:06.467 --> 11:10.667
I mean, any person with a brain
can see exactly what happened.

11:10.734 --> 11:13.400
You were doing what you were doing,
you were having lunch.

11:13.467 --> 11:17.467
I mean, because I don't know how you
were having lunch at the top of a hill.

11:17.533 --> 11:18.867
-[DiAngelo] It was an open field.
-You said yourself--

11:18.934 --> 11:21.166
You said, it was--
it was a portable lunch.

11:21.233 --> 11:22.400
You were having your sandwich.

11:22.467 --> 11:23.600
Sure, yes.

11:23.667 --> 11:26.367
[laughs]

11:27.600 --> 11:29.700
-We're on a hike--
-I love it!

11:29.767 --> 11:31.200
-I mean, we had to take something to eat.
-I love it.

11:31.266 --> 11:32.467
I... love...

11:32.533 --> 11:34.300
-It's embarrassing. You're being...
-The trail itself is over five miles.

11:34.367 --> 11:37.433
You're embarrassing yourself
in front of your child.

11:37.500 --> 11:38.900
-I don't feel embarrassed.
-You're embarrass--

11:38.967 --> 11:40.667
Well, I'm embarrassed for him.

11:40.734 --> 11:43.200
That's what happened.
When something happens like that,

11:43.266 --> 11:45.900
it's not something
that you did intentionally, sir.

11:45.967 --> 11:49.500
You were in a state park
with your two dogs, off-leash.

11:49.567 --> 11:51.900
Whatever excuse you made
that you were walking with them,

11:51.967 --> 11:55.200
with their leashes all morning
and you decided to take lunch

11:55.266 --> 11:58.533
at 11:30 in the mor--
[laughs] He did say 11:30, did he not?

11:58.600 --> 12:00.500
[DiAngelo] It was about that time.

12:00.567 --> 12:03.600
Well, she said
it was between 11 and 11:30.

12:05.233 --> 12:08.667
She said "Before noon, I would say
around 11 or 11:30.

12:08.734 --> 12:10.066
-Somewhere in there."
-Okay.

12:10.133 --> 12:12.767
So you decided to take an early lunch.

12:12.834 --> 12:15.934
And it was at that point
you want me to believe

12:16.000 --> 12:19.166
that when you were taking an early lunch
and having a sandwich,

12:19.233 --> 12:22.767
which gave you the ability
to have control over your dog,

12:22.834 --> 12:27.333
that you're on this hill,
and you saw through the hill

12:27.400 --> 12:28.700
that the horse was spooked

12:28.767 --> 12:31.133
when they were
on the other side of the hill,

12:31.200 --> 12:33.200
and you were on the other side of the hill

12:33.266 --> 12:35.567
and you saw that your dog,

12:35.633 --> 12:37.667
because your dog is under
your verbal control,

12:37.734 --> 12:42.533
you saw that your dog did not
either go after the horse...

12:42.600 --> 12:44.633
Even if the dog didn't go after the horse,

12:44.700 --> 12:46.166
to come up to it and bark,

12:46.233 --> 12:50.500
not under your control,
and then chase it,

12:50.567 --> 12:53.533
chase it to the fence
is what you're telling me

12:53.600 --> 12:57.066
if you say your dog
did not chase the horses.

12:57.133 --> 12:59.200
Pay attention to my question.

12:59.266 --> 13:02.000
Then what you're telling me is,

13:02.066 --> 13:03.767
you had control of your dog,

13:03.834 --> 13:07.100
you took your dog
and you did not get to the scene

13:07.166 --> 13:09.133
of where the horses stopped.

13:09.200 --> 13:12.166
That's just--
Think about the answer first.

13:12.233 --> 13:14.300
If you what you want me to believe is,

13:14.367 --> 13:17.867
and what you're telling me is
you had control of your dog,

13:17.934 --> 13:19.567
one or both,

13:19.633 --> 13:23.834
that you wouldn't go running after
your dog down to a fence.

13:23.900 --> 13:25.600
I was not running after my dog.

13:25.667 --> 13:27.467
-Okay, so did your--
-I was trying to help the situation.

13:27.533 --> 13:29.500
I saw that everybody had fallen,

13:29.567 --> 13:31.734
I grabbed the leash,
I did chase...

13:33.133 --> 13:36.033
-...my dog for two seconds. Okay.
-[Judy chuckles]

13:36.100 --> 13:38.000
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you, sir?

13:38.066 --> 13:39.633
-[DiAngelo] Yes, I do. I do.
-You understand what I'm saying to you?

13:39.700 --> 13:42.433
-My dog wouldn't-- But I didn't have to--
-[Judy] You sound-- you sound...

13:42.500 --> 13:43.633
-foolish.
-Okay.

13:43.700 --> 13:46.600
Because there's no way
that a normal person

13:46.667 --> 13:49.967
with any common sense at all
is assessing this testimony,

13:50.033 --> 13:53.567
which you keep changing, by the way,
you keep tripping yourself up.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.066
You keep tripping just a little bit.

13:55.133 --> 13:57.000
"I did chase it but just for two seconds."

13:57.066 --> 14:00.667
How do you chase a dog for two seconds
that you have control over?

14:00.734 --> 14:02.633
-Well...
-How do you chase a dog for two seconds?

14:02.700 --> 14:06.166
She was riled up as well by the horses
just jumping around.

14:06.233 --> 14:10.967
I-I mean, there's no...
there's no reason they should have...

14:11.033 --> 14:12.934
Been on the trail.
You wanna say that?

14:13.000 --> 14:15.567
"There's no reason that the horses
should have been on the trail."

14:15.633 --> 14:18.767
Without being trained enough
to deal with a dog that barks...

14:18.834 --> 14:21.300
[laughs]
They were out there for two days!

14:21.367 --> 14:23.700
Without incident. In a park.

14:23.767 --> 14:25.967
With lots of people and lots of dogs.

14:26.033 --> 14:28.433
-[DiAngelo] Right.
-You and your kid decided

14:28.500 --> 14:32.767
to take your dogs off-leash
and there was a terrible accident.

14:32.834 --> 14:35.600
And you have to take responsibility

14:35.667 --> 14:39.767
for the ultimate result
of not having control of your dogs!

14:39.834 --> 14:42.233
People could've gotten seriously injured.

14:42.300 --> 14:46.600
Now, it may be in a state park,
people are willing to take that risk.

14:46.667 --> 14:48.900
Listen, my dogs are very good dogs.

14:48.967 --> 14:51.567
They-- We were in the park--
Uncross your arms.

14:53.467 --> 14:54.867
My dogs are very good dogs.

14:54.934 --> 14:56.567
They follow my direction.

14:56.633 --> 15:01.500
But there's a reason
that we require people

15:01.567 --> 15:05.433
to have control of their dogs
at all times because...

15:05.500 --> 15:09.600
accidents happen,
and you don't make up a foolish story,

15:10.300 --> 15:12.800
-especially to this face...
-[chuckles]

15:12.867 --> 15:16.233
in front of, hopefully,
tens of millions of people,

15:16.300 --> 15:17.433
[chuckles]

15:18.100 --> 15:20.734
that doesn't take responsibility.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.967
And if you say, you know,
"My dog was there,

15:23.033 --> 15:26.100
we had been camping for three days,
never had any incident.

15:26.166 --> 15:28.133
It ran up the hill,
I didn't think anything of it.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.834
I didn't know horses
were coming over the hill.

15:30.900 --> 15:32.800
The horses got spooked."

15:32.867 --> 15:36.467
But there's a rule in the law
and it's called "but-for."

15:36.533 --> 15:38.667
It's a simple rule.

15:38.734 --> 15:41.500
It probably has some sort
of a Latin name.

15:41.567 --> 15:43.700
But I'm a simple girl from Brooklyn.

15:43.767 --> 15:44.834
[laughter]

15:44.900 --> 15:46.400
[music plays]

15:46.467 --> 15:50.233
"But for" your actions,
this incident would not have occurred.

15:50.300 --> 15:51.567
-It may have, though.
-[Judy] If you take a chance...

15:51.633 --> 15:55.600
Just a second, this is not a dance
where you lead and then I lead.

15:55.667 --> 15:57.300
-Sure.
-You talk,

15:57.367 --> 15:59.066
I finish. That's the rule.

16:04.300 --> 16:06.400
[theme music plays]

16:10.967 --> 16:14.900
[narrator] <i>Amber Mielke has accused</i>
<i>dog owner DiAngelo Larranaga</i>

16:14.967 --> 16:16.500
<i>of injuring her horses.</i>

16:16.567 --> 16:19.834
Okay, but for the fact that you...

16:19.900 --> 16:22.333
did not have control of your dogs,

16:22.400 --> 16:24.266
this incident wouldn't have happened.

16:24.333 --> 16:29.100
But-for, because they had been out
for at least six hours

16:29.166 --> 16:32.033
over a two-day period,
maybe seven or eight

16:32.100 --> 16:36.033
with other people who had dogs,
probably unleashed.

16:36.100 --> 16:38.300
So you're at a state park,

16:38.367 --> 16:40.266
you have dogs,
they like to run around.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.867
You throw a frisbee,
they go and chase the frisbee.

16:42.934 --> 16:45.133
Well, most of the time
nothing happens.

16:45.200 --> 16:49.000
But in the unlikely event
that a three-year-old

16:49.066 --> 16:51.934
catches the frisbee,
you never know what that dog's gonna do.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.266
You take a risk when you
lose control of your dog.

16:55.333 --> 16:56.700
What was the vet bill?

16:56.767 --> 17:01.433
The total vet expenses were $2,243.79.

17:01.500 --> 17:03.867
And I do have invoices for all of those.

17:03.934 --> 17:04.934
[Judy] He doesn't doubt it.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
Were the park rangers
called to this incident?

17:08.066 --> 17:10.000
Yes, I did call them with my cellphone.

17:10.066 --> 17:12.400
Did anything happen
as a result of that, sir?

17:12.467 --> 17:14.367
Um, I did receive...

17:14.433 --> 17:18.433
text messages, uh,
showing the injured pony.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.433
[Judy] No, as a result of
the park ranger connection.

17:20.500 --> 17:21.633
[DiAngelo] Oh, I'm sorry.

17:21.700 --> 17:24.567
Well, yes, that, uh, case was dismissed.

17:24.633 --> 17:26.400
Okay. What case?

17:26.467 --> 17:28.433
The case of the state of North Dakota,

17:28.500 --> 17:30.066
um, the county of Dunn.

17:30.133 --> 17:31.600
-[Judy] So...
-Versus myself.

17:31.667 --> 17:33.867
-[Judy] Okay. Were you arrested?
-[DiAngelo] No, I was not.

17:33.934 --> 17:35.233
[Judy] Okay, were you cited?

17:35.300 --> 17:37.433
-I... did receive a complaint.
-[Judy] Tell me how it happened.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.000
-What?
-I did receive a complaint.

17:39.066 --> 17:40.400
Okay, I'd like to see it.

17:42.633 --> 17:43.633
Good.

17:46.467 --> 17:48.033
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm. Welcome.

17:52.300 --> 17:56.800
Okay, well, this is a complaint.
And this complaint refers to a statute.

17:56.867 --> 17:57.934
Sarah?

17:58.000 --> 18:00.300
Could you pull up that statute for me?
Make sure it's--

18:00.367 --> 18:01.867
I do have a copy of the statute.

18:01.934 --> 18:02.967
-You do?
-Mm-hmm.

18:03.033 --> 18:03.867
There should be other forms.

18:03.934 --> 18:06.767
It's actually for disorderly conduct,
all right?

18:06.834 --> 18:09.467
They could've arrested you,
but they did not.

18:09.533 --> 18:10.967
Because that's what that document says.

18:11.033 --> 18:12.433
-I suppose so.
-[Judy] That's a statute?

18:12.500 --> 18:13.734
-I have it.
-You have it?

18:16.000 --> 18:19.400
I believe this references sub-section G,
Your Honor...

18:19.467 --> 18:21.233
-Thank you.
-...in the complaint.

18:23.233 --> 18:25.867
Okay, so what happened
as a result of this?

18:25.934 --> 18:27.867
-Did you have a hearing?
-I did.

18:27.934 --> 18:29.467
And did you testify at the hearing?

18:29.533 --> 18:31.500
-No.
-[Judy] You did not.

18:31.567 --> 18:32.834
-No.
-Why not?

18:32.900 --> 18:35.900
Uh, because the case was brought
in front of the judge.

18:35.967 --> 18:38.033
-Um, and...
-[Judy] No, just a second.

18:38.100 --> 18:41.700
If you don't appear for a hearing,
you're usually found guilty.

18:41.767 --> 18:43.633
No, oh, I'm sorry.
Well, I did appear, I-- [sighs]

18:43.700 --> 18:47.567
It was just, uh, because of COVID,
it was a Zoom call.

18:47.633 --> 18:50.033
-Do you know what I'm doing?
-I guess I'm misunderstanding, is all.

18:50.100 --> 18:52.133
Uh, yes, I did appear in front of a judge,

18:52.200 --> 18:53.700
and the case was dismissed.

18:53.767 --> 18:57.333
Okay. And it was dismissed
under what condition?

18:57.400 --> 18:58.834
Under the condition that, uh--

18:58.900 --> 19:01.500
[Judy] Now, just a second,
I'd like to see the Notice of Dismissal.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.033
Did you testify at this hearing?

19:15.100 --> 19:17.266
The case was dismissed because
the attorney did not show.

19:17.333 --> 19:18.967
And the judge let the case go.

19:19.033 --> 19:20.300
Which attorney didn't show?

19:20.367 --> 19:23.467
-The state's attorney.
-The state's attorney didn't show up?

19:23.533 --> 19:25.300
-[Amber] Mm-hmm.
-[laughs]

19:25.367 --> 19:28.834
The judge dismissed all cases
that day for that state's attorney.

19:28.900 --> 19:31.934
[laughs] Is it accurate
that the case was dismissed

19:32.000 --> 19:34.400
because the other side didn't show up?

19:34.467 --> 19:36.800
-That is true.
-[laughs] Okay.

19:38.033 --> 19:40.500
That's an answer.
Good. All right.

19:40.567 --> 19:44.467
Now, the remainder
of your damages is to

19:44.533 --> 19:47.900
show me the depreciated value
to the pony.

19:47.967 --> 19:50.934
-Do you have photographs of the pony?
-[Amber] I do.

19:52.834 --> 19:54.033
And the injuries?

20:00.900 --> 20:01.834
Oh.

20:02.734 --> 20:04.467
Have you seen these photographs, sir?

20:04.533 --> 20:05.834
[DiAngelo] I have seen some.

20:08.166 --> 20:10.700
Your unleashed dogs caused
a great deal of damage.

20:10.767 --> 20:12.233
I do believe that...

20:12.300 --> 20:14.066
-I don't care what you believe.
-...the barbed wire

20:14.133 --> 20:16.133
-scratched that dog-- the horse...
-I don't-- I don't--

20:16.200 --> 20:17.667
I don't care what you believe.

20:17.734 --> 20:20.467
I know my dog did not
bite her horse, so...

20:20.533 --> 20:23.567
-He wasn't anywhere near the horse.
-Your unleashed animal

20:23.633 --> 20:28.033
caused a domino effect,
which caused injury,

20:28.100 --> 20:30.567
could've caused injury
to human beings.

20:30.633 --> 20:34.100
You chose to have a dog unleashed.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.834
Usually, it's okay.

20:35.900 --> 20:38.066
This time, it was not.

20:38.133 --> 20:43.000
Your choice. But for your actions,
this incident would not have occurred.

20:43.066 --> 20:44.367
-It may have though.
-[Judy] You take a chance.

20:44.433 --> 20:46.400
-Just a second. This is not a dance...
-[DiAngelo] Okay.

20:46.467 --> 20:49.133
-where you lead and then I lead.
-[DiAngelo] Sure.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.734
You talk, I finish.
That's the rule.

20:51.800 --> 20:52.834
Yes, Your Honor.

20:52.900 --> 20:55.667
Ms. Mielke, is this
the pony that was injured?

20:55.734 --> 20:56.633
[Amber] Yes.

20:56.700 --> 20:58.500
[Judy] And whose child
is riding the pony?

20:58.567 --> 21:01.000
In that picture that you just showed
was my son Wyatt.

21:01.066 --> 21:03.533
Okay. When did you purchase this pony?

21:03.600 --> 21:05.500
I purchased the pony when
my son was three years old.

21:05.567 --> 21:06.900
-[Judy] How old is he now?
-He's eight.

21:06.967 --> 21:10.000
And has he ridden this pony
in competitions?

21:10.066 --> 21:11.700
That looks like a competition picture.

21:11.767 --> 21:14.533
Correct. He trained the pony himself
for the barrel racing.

21:14.600 --> 21:18.734
The pony was broke to ride
but not trained for speed events.

21:18.800 --> 21:21.300
Has he been able to ride the pony since,
in competition?

21:21.367 --> 21:25.767
He has rode his pony--
He has rode his pony... not at events.

21:25.834 --> 21:27.033
-"Not at events."
-[Amber] Correct.

21:27.100 --> 21:28.400
Have there been any events?

21:28.467 --> 21:29.567
There's been a few.

21:29.633 --> 21:31.900
Is the pony capable of being ridden?

21:31.967 --> 21:33.500
-Yes.
-That way.

21:33.567 --> 21:37.500
I don't know that she'll ever ride
the same way as she was before.

21:37.567 --> 21:40.333
Judging for the plaintiff
in the amount of $3,000.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.533
We're finished. Thank you very much.

21:41.600 --> 21:42.900
[Kevin] Court adjourned.

21:46.133 --> 21:50.900
My kids were traumatized just as much
by the whole incident.

21:50.967 --> 21:53.066
It was probably one of
the worst days of my life.

21:53.133 --> 21:58.233
I know that we tried to help our best
to alleviate the situation.

21:58.300 --> 22:01.333
They're not afraid of dogs. We have
three dogs at home that ride with us.

22:01.400 --> 22:04.133
But our dogs also don't
bite our horses' faces.

22:04.200 --> 22:06.900
I still don't believe that we're
responsible for this situation.

22:06.967 --> 22:09.567
They were chasing cattle before,
that the owners were letting them.

22:09.633 --> 22:11.400
You know it is... what it is.

22:12.066 --> 22:14.367
You really came down hard
on that defendant in there.

22:14.433 --> 22:15.567
I did.

22:15.633 --> 22:19.033
Because any normal person understands

22:19.100 --> 22:22.767
that when you take dogs to a state park,

22:22.834 --> 22:25.133
you take big huskies, you know,
you gotta keep them on a leash.

22:25.200 --> 22:27.900
And usually it's okay.
But this wasn't okay.

22:27.967 --> 22:29.633
This turned out badly.

22:29.700 --> 22:32.800
And it's a risk that you take,
but then if you take the risk,

22:32.867 --> 22:36.100
and something bad happens,
you take responsibility for it.

22:36.166 --> 22:39.700
And when you fabricate,
in front of your child,

22:39.767 --> 22:42.533
that is the worst lesson
that you can teach them.

22:42.600 --> 22:44.500
Anyway, that's why I got annoyed
with him.
