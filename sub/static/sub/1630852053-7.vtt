OR MAYBE JUST, COCAINE!

11:01.728 --> 11:07.834
AH!
WELL, WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT,

11:07.834 --> 11:10.437
ADS CAN MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE.
TONIGHT WE'RE GAWK TO TALK ABOUT

11:10.437 --> 11:15.342
WHAT MIGHT BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE
AND LONG-RUNNING AD CAMPAIGN OF

11:15.342 --> 11:16.609
ALL-TIME.
THESE ADS AREN'T RUNNING BETWEEN

11:16.609 --> 11:19.646
THE TV SHOWS.
THEY ARE THE TV SHOWS, AND THE

11:19.646 --> 11:22.882
PRODUCT THEY'RE SELLING IS THE
AMERICAN POLICE OFFICER.

11:22.882 --> 11:25.085
FOR MOST AMERICANS, ALMOST
EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT THE

11:25.085 --> 11:28.788
POLICE COMES FROM THE MEDIA,
AFTER OUR MOST AMERICANS HAVE

11:28.788 --> 11:31.591
NEVER BEEN ARRESTED AND IN A
GIVEN YEAR VAST MAJORITY DON'T

11:31.591 --> 11:36.963
HAVE CONTACT WITH POLICE AT ALL.
IN 2016, FOR EXAMPLE, ONLY 24%

11:36.963 --> 11:40.734
OF RESIDENTS EXPERIENCED CONTACT
WITH POLICE.

11:40.734 --> 11:47.307
COPS ARE ONE OF THOSE THINGS YOU
SEE A LOT MORE OF ON TV THAN

11:47.307 --> 11:53.947
REAL LIFE.
SIMULTANEOUS ORGASMS OR SHELDON.

11:53.947 --> 11:57.650
BUT THEY'RE ON TV EVERYWHERE.
THE PAST 60 YEARS THERE'S AN AN

11:57.650 --> 12:00.553
ORGANIZED PLAN TO BUILD UP THE
REPUTATION OF THE POLICE AND DO

12:00.553 --> 12:03.289
IT USING THE THING AMERICANS
LOVE MOST.

12:03.289 --> 12:07.827
SITTING IN FRONT OF THE TV.
IT'S CALLED COPAGANDA.

12:07.827 --> 12:10.563
AND TO UNDERSTAND WHERE IT COMES
FROM LET'S GO ALL THE WAY BACK

12:10.563 --> 12:14.934
TO THE 1950s TO A SHOW CALLED
"DRAGNET."

12:14.934 --> 12:19.739
I JUST WANT TO SAY IT WOULD BE
AN AMAZING NAME FOR A TV SHOW

12:19.739 --> 12:21.775
ABOUT FOUR HACKERS ALSO DRAG
QUEENS.

12:21.775 --> 12:25.278

[ APPLAUSE ]
ANYWAY, THE ACTUAL "DRAGNET"

12:35.655 --> 12:38.224
SHOW WAS A SHOW ABOUT THE
POLICE, AND IN ORDER TO MAKE IT

12:38.224 --> 12:42.395
MORE REALISTIC, THEIR CREATOR
MADE A DEAL WITH THE LAPD TO GET

12:42.395 --> 12:44.764
INSIDE INFORMATION BUT THE
POLICE GOT SOMETHING MUCH BETTER

12:44.764 --> 12:48.935
IN RETURN, BECAUSE THEY MADE A
DEAL THAT ALL SCRIPTS HAD TO BE

12:48.935 --> 12:51.971
FORMALLY APPROVED BY THE LAPD'S
PUBLIC INFORMATION DIVISION

12:51.971 --> 12:55.175
BEFORE FILMING BEGAN.
IN OTHER WORDS, THE POLICE GOT

12:55.175 --> 12:59.279
TO DECIDE HOW THE POLICE WERE
PORTRAYED ON TV, WHICH IS

12:59.279 --> 13:01.915
INSANELY BIASED.
LIKE HAVING RICH PEOPLE WITH

13:01.915 --> 13:05.118
ATTACHMENT ISSUES GIVE NOTES ON
SUCCESSION.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.220
[ LAUGHTER ]
THE RESULTS OF THIS DEAL WITH

13:07.220 --> 13:12.325

ERA WHEN 50 LOS ANGELES POLICE

13:12.325 --> 13:16.062

YOUNG MEN IN THEIR CUSTODY ON

13:16.062 --> 13:19.632
CHRISTMAS "DRAGNET" INSTEAD
SHOWED A GROUP OF UPSTANDING

13:19.632 --> 13:23.536
COPS DOING THEIR DARNEDEST TO
SOLVE CRIMES.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.305
COPAGANDA, AND AMERICANS BOUGHT
IT.

13:25.305 --> 13:29.609
WORKED SO WELL THE MEDIA HAS
DONE IT OVER AND OVER SINCE.

13:29.609 --> 13:32.979
"DRAGNET" BECAME THE TEMPLATE
FOR EVERY COP SHOW YOU'VE SEEN

13:32.979 --> 13:40.220
FROM "LAW & ORDER" TO N
PEDESTRIAN BLUE 0 "NCIS" TO

13:40.220 --> 13:42.689
"SISTER COPS."
I MADE THE LAST ONE UP BUT IT'S

13:42.689 --> 13:45.792
A GREAT IDEA AND MY SISTER AND I
WOULD BE HAPPY TO CO-STAR.

13:45.792 --> 13:49.162
CALL ME, NBC!
COPAGANDA SINGLE-HANDEDLY

13:49.162 --> 13:51.297
CREATED LEGEND OF THE HERO
POLICE OFFICER.

13:51.297 --> 13:55.769
ALSO PERPETUATED OTHER MISSTEPS
UP TO THIS DAY, LIKE THAT CRIME

13:55.769 --> 13:58.405
IS RISING CONSTANTLY.
OR THAT POLICING IS ONE OF THE

13:58.405 --> 14:01.708
MOST DANGEROUS JOBS.
OR THAT BLACK PEOPLE ARE

14:01.708 --> 14:03.076
CRIMINALS.
SO LET'S START WITH THE FIRST

14:03.076 --> 14:05.912
MYTH THAT CRIME IN AMERICA IS
RAMPANT.

14:05.912 --> 14:10.350
ACCORDING TO GALLOP POLL THE
PAST 20 YEARS MORE THAN HALF OF

14:10.350 --> 14:14.654
AMERICANS BELIEVED CRIME IS
WORSE THAN THE YEAR BEFORE YET

14:14.654 --> 14:17.223
HERE'S WHAT THE ACTUAL CRIME
RATE HAS BEEN DOING.

14:17.223 --> 14:18.892
RIGHT.
CRIME DECREASING CONSISTENTLY.

14:18.892 --> 14:22.228
THE ONLY THING FALLING MORE
STEADILY IS PRESIDENT BIDEN.

14:22.228 --> 14:33.173
[ LAUGHTER ]
OH, THAT -- SO WHY DO WE --

14:33.173 --> 14:39.746
[ LAUGHTER ]
WE'VE ALL DONE IT!

14:39.746 --> 14:41.815
WE'VE ALL DONE IT!
IT'S GREAT.

14:41.815 --> 14:46.219
OH -- SO WHY DO WE THINK CRIME
IS GETTING WORSE?

14:46.219 --> 14:51.458
WELL, ACCORDING TO ONE STUDY,
RISE AND FALL ALONG WITH TV

14:51.458 --> 14:52.625
VIOLENCE.
IN OTHER WORDS, PEOPLE THINK

14:52.625 --> 14:54.861
CRIME IS BAD BECAUSE IT'S BAD ON
TV.

14:54.861 --> 15:01.034
IT'S THE SAME REASON THAT AFTER
WATCHING THE GREAT BRITISH BACK

15:01.034 --> 15:07.307
BACKOFF I THINK I COULD MAKE A
SOUFFLE BECAUSE THEY MADE IT

15:07.307 --> 15:09.142
LOOK GOOD.
I WANT TO BE CAREFUL ON THIS

15:09.142 --> 15:14.180
ONE, JOBS, BEING A POLICE
OFFICER IS A DANGEROUS JOB, AND

15:14.180 --> 15:19.152
ASIDE FROM ALMOST SPRARNING AN
ANKLE DURING A SONG PERIOD, MY

15:19.152 --> 15:23.356
JOB IS RISKY'S I DON'T WANT TO
DISCOUNT THE WORK THEY DO.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.925
ACCORDING TO BUREAU OF LABOR
STATISTICS BEING A POLICE

15:25.925 --> 15:31.064
OFFICER IS ACTUALLY FAR LESS
DANGEROUS THAN OTHER JOBS.

15:31.064 --> 15:34.267
LIKE A GARBAGE COLLECTOR OR
DELIVERY DRIVER.

15:34.267 --> 15:38.705
COPS HAVE FEW E FATALITIES THAN
THE GUY WHO BRINGS YOU CHICKEN

15:38.705 --> 15:41.908
TENDERS WHEN YOU WERE DRUNK AND
REMINDS YOU WHY YOU ORDERED

15:41.908 --> 15:43.476
THEM.
[ LAUGHTER ]

15:43.476 --> 15:47.280
AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET A
REALISTIC IDEA OF THE DANGER OF

15:47.280 --> 15:50.750
THE POLICING, BECAUSE ONE OF THE
MAJOR REASONS WHY WE CAN'T

15:50.750 --> 15:53.887
REFORM THE WAY COPS ARE TRAINED
IS BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO WATCH

15:53.887 --> 15:59.492
POLICE SHOWS THINK COPS GET INTO
A KARATE FIGHT THREE TIME AS

15:59.492 --> 16:04.431
WORSE AND WORSE COPAGANDA MAY
HAVE CONVINCED THEM THEY ARE IN

16:04.431 --> 16:07.133
DANGER, WHICH IS WHY THEY KILL
MORE PEOPLE RUNNING AWAY FROM

16:07.133 --> 16:10.303
THEM OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS
THAN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF COPS

16:10.303 --> 16:14.140
SHOT AND KILLED AND DUTY.
THAT MIGHT ALSO BE WHY SINCE

16:14.140 --> 16:16.910
2015 POLICE OFFICERS SHOT AND
KILLED THREE TIMES MORE BLACK

16:16.910 --> 16:19.813
PEOPLE THAN COPS WERE SHOT AND
KILLED BY ANYBODY.

16:19.813 --> 16:25.051
BEING A POLICE OFFICER IS A
DANGEROUS JOB, BUT WHAT BE MY

16:25.051 --> 16:27.687
DANGEROUS BEING A BLACK PERSON
WHO RUNS INTO ONE AND THAT

16:27.687 --> 16:30.457
BRINGS US TO OUR FINAL COPAGANDA
MYTH.

16:30.457 --> 16:37.263
THAT BLACK PEOPLE ARE CRIMINALS.
HOW DOES TV NORMALIZE

16:37.263 --> 16:42.068
DISPROPORTIONATELY KILLING BLACK
PEOPLE?

16:42.068 --> 16:47.340
TEACHING THE AUDIENCE -- PLAY
64% OF ALL GANG MEMBERS.

16:47.340 --> 16:50.844
WHEN A CHARACTER IS LISTED AS A
THUG IT'S PLAYED BY A BLACK

16:50.844 --> 16:53.179
ACTOR 66% OF THE TIME.
THINK ABOUT THAT.

16:53.179 --> 16:57.584
IF EVERY TIME YOU SEE A CRIMINAL
ON TV IT'S A BLACK PERSON YOU'LL

16:57.584 --> 16:59.185
START TO THINK THERE'S A
CORRELATION.

16:59.185 --> 17:03.757
THE SAME WAY EVERY TIME I SEE A
SKIN CARE COMMERCIAL J. LO IS IN

17:03.757 --> 17:10.163
I'M GOING TO THINK IT'S NORMAL
TO LOOK LIKE THIS AT 52.

17:10.163 --> 17:14.734
SUPER HUMAN AND SHOULDN'T LOOK
LIKE THAT.

17:14.734 --> 17:19.706
POLICE OFFICERS ARE HEROES WE'RE
TAUGHT SAVING US FROM A COUNTRY

17:19.706 --> 17:23.143
FULL OF BLACK CRIMINALS AND IT'S
BULL SHIT.

17:23.143 --> 17:26.513
IF WE WANT TO MAKE IT BETTER WE
HAVE TO START WORKING WITH THE

17:26.513 --> 17:28.515
TRUTH.
TAKE IT FROM ME HEISMAN TROPHY
