WEBVTT

00:01.167 --> 00:04.536
All right, we're ready.

00:04.538 --> 00:07.439
(indistinct conversations)

00:07.441 --> 00:10.142
Welcome to the east wing.

00:10.144 --> 00:13.012
Now I know you already know
what goes on in the west wing,

00:13.014 --> 00:14.480
So I thought it would be fun

00:14.482 --> 00:16.715
To show you what happens
behind the scenes

00:16.717 --> 00:20.652
Miguel, get jim carney
on the phone right now.

00:20.654 --> 00:23.789
Rachel, good morning.
(chuckles)

00:23.791 --> 00:26.658
(chuckles nervously)
hello, mrs... First lady.

00:26.660 --> 00:29.194
Oh, there's no need to be formal
for the cameras.

00:29.196 --> 00:31.697
Everyone, this is
my chief of staff, rachel moss.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.265
Rachel, did we get
the new itinerary

00:33.267 --> 00:34.299
For the east africa trip yet?

00:34.301 --> 00:35.667
Yes. I put that
on your desk.

00:35.669 --> 00:38.303
And also, ellen called to see
if you made a decision

00:38.305 --> 00:40.339
On what china to use
for the reception.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.074
Tell her I've chosen
the truman collection.

00:42.076 --> 00:44.576
As first lady,
it's my responsibility

00:44.578 --> 00:48.213
To curate the white house's
extensive art collection.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.749
It also means hosting
a cocktail reception this week

00:50.751 --> 00:53.185
To unveil some of our recently
restored paintings.

00:53.187 --> 00:56.221
I know. Hosting parties--
tough job. (laughs)

00:56.223 --> 00:57.589
Oh! Look who it is.

00:57.591 --> 01:01.126
It's cyrus beene,
the president's chief of staff.

01:01.128 --> 01:03.729
Please. I haven't had time
to do my hair.

01:03.731 --> 01:07.232
(laughs)

01:07.234 --> 01:09.334
Can, uh... Can we cut now?

01:09.336 --> 01:10.602
Okay.

01:10.604 --> 01:13.338
<i>(machine rewinding)</i>

01:15.675 --> 01:18.444
(moans)

01:19.779 --> 01:23.282
(moans)

01:23.284 --> 01:27.252
(moans)

01:27.254 --> 01:29.855
Good morning.

01:29.857 --> 01:32.124
Mm. Good morning.

01:32.126 --> 01:33.292
(moans)

01:35.795 --> 01:38.197
(jerry in distance)
son? Time to get up!

01:38.199 --> 01:39.364
(whispers) your father.

01:39.366 --> 01:41.100
Ignore him.
Maybe he'll go away.
I mean it!

01:41.102 --> 01:43.168
Stop fooling around
like a pair of teenagers

01:43.170 --> 01:45.771
And put some clothes on. I need
you both down here in five.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.873
Oh, I do not like that man
right now.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.274
I never like him.

01:49.276 --> 01:52.411
(giggling) fitz.

01:52.413 --> 01:54.279
I am trying
to get you pregnant.

01:54.281 --> 01:56.215
Be quiet and let me work.
(giggles)

01:56.217 --> 01:58.617
But your father's
right downstairs.

01:58.619 --> 02:01.186
Hurry it up!
(giggles)

02:01.188 --> 02:03.689
Coming!

02:03.691 --> 02:05.858
What does he want?
I don't know.

02:07.427 --> 02:09.228
(under breath)
he was shtupping her.

02:09.230 --> 02:10.896
Oh, here.
Meet your kingmaker.

02:10.898 --> 02:14.299
Cyrus beene--a genius who spins
average men into candidates

02:14.301 --> 02:16.535
And candidates into gold...
Nice to meet you.

02:16.537 --> 02:19.905
And if we can just pry him out
of his ivory tower long enough,

02:19.907 --> 02:23.408
In the california governor's
mansion, you mark my words.

02:23.410 --> 02:25.210
I thought we weren't even
forming an exploratory committee

02:25.212 --> 02:27.146
For another three years.
Well, that was before
you got moved up

02:27.148 --> 02:31.183
Word on the street is that
stevenson is about to drop out.

02:31.185 --> 02:34.520
Well, he's tall,
like you said. That's good.

02:34.522 --> 02:38.157
Nice head of hair. Also a plus.
And where are we on schooling?

02:38.159 --> 02:40.893
Oh, yale, rhodes scholar,
navy, harvard law, and--
that'll do.

02:40.895 --> 02:42.928
The wife is perfect.

02:42.930 --> 02:45.831
She's gorgeous, isn't she?
Thank you, mr. Beene.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.433
What is it?

02:48.435 --> 02:50.936
I think it's our first step
to the white house, baby.

02:51.838 --> 03:01.513
(projector and camera shutter
click)

03:01.515 --> 03:04.516
(gunshots continue in distance)

03:04.518 --> 03:07.586
(whirring)

03:10.723 --> 03:12.191
(chuckles)

03:12.193 --> 03:14.359
Not bad, robin.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.694
Not bad? He's dead.

03:15.696 --> 03:16.862
Oh, look at you,
all hopeful.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.530
I like it.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.899
(gunshots continue in distance)

03:20.901 --> 03:23.402
So... What's next for you?
A dark alley? A rooftop?

03:23.404 --> 03:25.437
More like a crappy motel
in the boonies.

03:25.439 --> 03:26.872
(case thuds)

03:29.242 --> 03:30.542
Who's the target?

03:30.544 --> 03:32.878
Oh, it's a good one.
45-year-old project manager,

03:32.880 --> 03:35.681
He might be banging
his 22-year-old assistant.

03:35.683 --> 03:36.882
Wife wants
audio and stills.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.850
Wait. You're a p.I. Now?

03:38.852 --> 03:41.687
I know. It's like willie mays
coaching little league.

03:41.689 --> 03:43.689
So what happens
after you find him?

03:43.691 --> 03:45.891
I catch the guy
with his pants down.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.492
Wife gets mad.
She tells her friends,

03:47.494 --> 03:49.861
Then her friends hire me.
Boom. References. Exciting.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.697
(case lid thuds)
see you next time.

03:51.699 --> 03:54.800
(gunshots continue)

03:57.604 --> 04:00.872
(cell phone rings)

04:00.874 --> 04:04.443
(ring)

04:04.445 --> 04:07.713
(ring)

04:07.715 --> 04:09.948
(ring)

04:09.950 --> 04:11.350
(keys jangle)

04:11.352 --> 04:14.519
(ring)

04:14.521 --> 04:17.889
(ring)

04:17.891 --> 04:21.593
(ring)

04:21.595 --> 04:23.662
(ring, beep)

04:23.664 --> 04:24.963
(fitz) olivia?

04:24.965 --> 04:26.932
(breathing unevenly)

04:26.934 --> 04:29.501
Olivia?

04:29.503 --> 04:31.403
Liv.

04:31.405 --> 04:34.306
I need you to say something
so that I know that it's you.

04:34.308 --> 04:35.941
I can't just...

04:37.977 --> 04:40.445
I have to hang up
if it isn't you.

04:40.447 --> 04:43.515
(exhales) it's me.

04:43.517 --> 04:44.916
How are you?

04:44.918 --> 04:46.018
I've been worried
about you.

04:46.020 --> 04:48.620
I'm fine. I'm great.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.922
Liv--
you don't get to ask me
how I am!

04:50.924 --> 04:53.292
We don't know each other.
You're a stranger.

04:53.294 --> 04:54.693
I need to know
that you're safe.

04:54.695 --> 04:55.694
I wanna know how you are.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.362
I'm surrounded by murderers.

04:57.364 --> 05:00.599
I'm surrounded by men
who have a body count.

05:00.601 --> 05:04.970
Made by people I thought
I loved. <i>That</i> is how I am.

05:07.073 --> 05:08.440
I don't expect you
to forgive me,

05:08.442 --> 05:10.042
But there are things
you don't know,

05:10.044 --> 05:11.543
Things I can nev--

05:11.545 --> 05:13.945
(sighs) there are reasons.

05:13.947 --> 05:15.547
Why are you even
calling me?

05:15.549 --> 05:16.915
I just...

05:19.052 --> 05:20.585
I love you.

05:20.587 --> 05:21.953
So what?

05:33.933 --> 05:36.068
I thought I knew you.

05:38.438 --> 05:42.007
I thought I knew...
Everything about you.

05:46.946 --> 05:48.914
Livvie, I need you
to stay away from jake.

05:48.916 --> 05:51.416
What?
Stop looking into remington.

05:51.418 --> 05:53.652
It's dangerous. You being
around jake is dangerous.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.020
He's got a price on his head.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.522
Rowan is the one
who is dangerous.

05:57.524 --> 06:00.826
Rowan? How do you know rowan?

06:00.828 --> 06:02.728
You don't know everything
about me, either.

06:02.730 --> 06:05.497
Digging on remington,
for your own safety.

06:05.499 --> 06:06.898
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.667
Please <i>stop</i> digging.

06:11.137 --> 06:12.571
Livvie...

06:12.573 --> 06:15.474
We're not strangers.

06:15.476 --> 06:17.642
We're not.

06:17.644 --> 06:18.710
(beep)

06:27.453 --> 06:29.020
You sure you wanna do this?

06:31.057 --> 06:32.758
They just got off
the elevator.

06:32.760 --> 06:33.859
(door closes in distance)

06:33.861 --> 06:35.627
Send them in.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.028
Hey! Meeting.

06:37.030 --> 06:39.064
(olivia sighs)

06:39.066 --> 06:41.933
What is all this?
We have a new client.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.468
In the middle
of a campaign?

06:43.470 --> 06:45.003
Josie's working on
her stump speech for a few days.

06:45.005 --> 06:47.072
While she's doing that,
we'll be doing this.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.473
Is this the client?
She looks familiar.

06:48.475 --> 06:50.675
Probably because
she was my mother.

06:50.677 --> 06:53.145
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

07:01.087 --> 07:04.623
We have over 275 paintings
in the white house,

07:04.625 --> 07:06.158
And we're 2 years
into a 6-year project

07:06.160 --> 07:07.526
To have them all restored.

07:07.528 --> 07:08.627
Yet another reason
to vote for my husband.

07:08.629 --> 07:09.728
(both laugh)

07:09.730 --> 07:11.963
I like this one.
Very moody.

07:11.965 --> 07:13.865
Point lobos in monterey.

07:13.867 --> 07:16.001
It's on loan
from the guggenheim.

07:16.003 --> 07:17.769
Anytime fitz and I
can bring a little

07:17.771 --> 07:20.639
Of our home state of california
into the white house, we do.

07:20.641 --> 07:21.940
But you were raised
in the south.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.008
Yes! I'm a tar heel.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.776
You're a southerner.
(chuckles)

07:24.778 --> 07:26.611
Yet you called california
your home state.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.680
Shouldn't you consider
north carolina home?

07:28.682 --> 07:30.882
Well, I moved to california
when I got married, so...

07:30.884 --> 07:32.684
Do you feel like you lost
a piece of yourself

07:32.686 --> 07:36.755
That you made sacrifices to join
the grant political dynasty?

07:36.757 --> 07:41.092
I'm saying I consider home
to be wherever fitz is.

07:41.094 --> 07:43.528
To win california,

07:43.530 --> 07:45.697
You need the full
khachigian hook.

07:45.699 --> 07:46.898
Thanks to senator grant's

07:46.900 --> 07:49.100
Generous and continuous
farm subsidies,

07:49.102 --> 07:51.102
You'll inherit the hicks
pretty easily.

07:51.104 --> 07:55.073
Add these u.F.O.-Spotting
desert-trash districts,

07:55.075 --> 07:56.541
Along with

07:56.543 --> 07:58.510
The defense industry-dependent
inland empire,

07:58.512 --> 08:00.579
And you lock up everything
from bakersfield to riverside.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.681
Lord knows
they love me in the south.

08:02.683 --> 08:06.017
They used to. But the demos
have changed drastically.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.519
The tidal wave
of new immigrants--

08:07.521 --> 08:09.221
They're not as likely
to cozy up to richie rich

08:09.223 --> 08:10.522
And snow white here.

08:10.524 --> 08:11.990
No offense.
None taken.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.058
Well,
you better learn spanish.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.160
<i>Rápido.</i>
<i>Please don't.</i>

08:15.162 --> 08:17.529
Voters can always spot a phony.
You can't be who you're not.

08:17.531 --> 08:19.631
How do you suggest
we connect with them?

08:19.633 --> 08:21.666
You <i>don't.</i> Ignore 'em.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.568
What do you mean, ignore them?
What the hell kind of strategy--

08:23.570 --> 08:27.539
It's simple! You're a war hero
with a strong military record.

08:27.541 --> 08:30.675
Get your navy buddies
to stump on your behalf.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.577
And we can link together

08:32.579 --> 08:34.513
All these districts
around san diego,

08:34.515 --> 08:36.581
Chock-full of retired military.

08:36.583 --> 08:39.584
<i>Then</i> we swing up to the o.C.--

08:39.586 --> 08:41.620
That big, fat grouper

08:41.622 --> 08:44.756
Of conservative votes
<i>at the end of the hook!</i>

08:44.758 --> 08:47.859
No.
What? What do you mean, "no"?
The man's right. Spot on!

08:47.861 --> 08:49.728
I'm not running as a war hero.
It's that simple.

08:49.730 --> 08:52.597
Fitzgerald, other than
name recognition,

08:52.599 --> 08:53.765
It's all you've got.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.200
So we wait.
Run in the next cycle.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.701
In the meantime,
I expand my résumé.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.003
No, you won't find
a weaker field than this.

08:58.005 --> 09:00.305
That's for damn sure.
It's now or never.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.607
Have you heard a word
of what I've just said?

09:02.609 --> 09:04.109
Fitz, I'm sure
that we can--
son.

09:04.111 --> 09:06.711
Do what you're told.
Running on
my military experience

09:06.713 --> 09:08.280
Is off-limits.

09:08.282 --> 09:10.649
End of story.

09:13.686 --> 09:16.655
It's bad enough that I actually
have to spend my days

09:16.657 --> 09:19.658
Choosing drapes and digging
holes in the rose garden,

09:19.660 --> 09:22.594
But to pretend that I actually
enjoy it on camera?

09:22.596 --> 09:25.096
You want fitz to have a shot
at re-election come November,

09:25.098 --> 09:26.665
Then we need to rehab
your image.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.233
I just don't understand
why I have to apologize

09:28.235 --> 09:29.668
For his affair.

09:29.670 --> 09:32.270
They blame the two of you
equally.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.272
It's <i>not</i> fair.
It's america. Now come here.

09:34.274 --> 09:35.907
(sighs)

09:35.909 --> 09:38.643
What do you think
of this one?

09:38.645 --> 09:41.846
No.
But she's got a tattoo
of a dragonfly on her ass.

09:41.848 --> 09:44.816
It's sexy.
It's trashy. She's trashy.

09:44.818 --> 09:47.185
It's an escort web site.
Mellie, trashy's a given.

09:47.187 --> 09:48.820
I've grown up
with southern boys

09:48.822 --> 09:50.155
Like daniel douglas
my whole life.
(clicking keys)

09:50.157 --> 09:51.790
They want someone
who's sweet and innocent

09:51.792 --> 09:53.124
Who only turns into a whore

09:53.126 --> 09:54.993
Once the bedroom door closes.
(clicks key)

09:54.995 --> 09:57.362
Like her.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.264
You're way better
at picking out hookers

09:59.266 --> 10:01.833
Than you are china patterns.
Mm.

10:01.835 --> 10:04.336
Just make sure sally's
out of town for the reception.

10:04.338 --> 10:06.137
I'm on my way
to talk to her now.
Good.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.639
Once that's done,
I'll go rattle her cage,

10:07.641 --> 10:09.774
Remind her exactly
who she's married to.

10:10.376 --> 10:12.010
Madame vice president,

10:12.012 --> 10:14.613
I know you have a lot
on your plate, but...

10:14.615 --> 10:15.747
Funny. I thought it was
your entire vocation in life

10:15.749 --> 10:17.849
To make sure
my plate remains empty.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.317
I'm asking you
to go to iowa.

10:19.319 --> 10:22.821
Reagan dinner.
The president is tied up

10:22.823 --> 10:23.989
With the budget negotiations,

10:23.991 --> 10:25.123
So he was hoping
you could take his place,

10:25.125 --> 10:26.358
But if you don't want to--

10:26.360 --> 10:29.027
I'll do it.
Fill mara in on the details.

10:29.029 --> 10:33.098
(singsongy)
the president thanks you.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.199
Cyrus.

10:34.201 --> 10:37.135
Feeling guilty
about the mellie interview?

10:37.137 --> 10:38.670
I don't control who gets
to interview--

10:38.672 --> 10:39.971
Oh, you control everything,

10:39.973 --> 10:41.373
Which is precisely why
I wanna kill you

10:41.375 --> 10:45.176
I wasn't even approached.
Take it up
with the press secretary.

10:45.178 --> 10:47.879
I am supposed to be the go-to
guy for sitdowns like these.

10:47.881 --> 10:50.348
It's just one interview.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.984
Plenty more to come,
if we get a second term.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.085
I'll be covering
city council by then.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.854
Your body chemistry
seems way off.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.656
Did you have your shake
this morning?

10:57.658 --> 11:00.025
Yes, I had my--I am not
manufacturing this anxiety.

11:00.027 --> 11:01.893
This is actual anxiety,

11:01.895 --> 11:03.428
Grounded in
genuine impending doom.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.430
Take it up
with the press secretary.

11:05.432 --> 11:07.399
(sighs) oh, god.

11:07.401 --> 11:09.267
(projector and camera shutter
click)

11:09.269 --> 11:10.435
So let me
get this straight.

11:10.437 --> 11:12.704
Your dad--not only is he

11:12.706 --> 11:15.373
The head of this country's most
top secret spy organization,

11:15.375 --> 11:17.008
He's also responsible
for shooting the plane down

11:17.010 --> 11:18.343
That your mother was on.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.812
He gave the order, yes.

11:20.814 --> 11:23.148
Whether it was to kill
my mother specifically

11:23.150 --> 11:24.683
Or she was
collateral damage,

11:24.685 --> 11:26.251
That's what I need your help
figuring out.

11:26.253 --> 11:31.423
And I probably should have
told you sooner, but...

11:32.458 --> 11:34.759
Liv's father's a dangerous man.

11:34.761 --> 11:37.162
She was trying to protect you.
Which is why

11:37.164 --> 11:39.698
I need you to be 100% sure you
want to work with me on this.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.266
You don't have to.

11:41.268 --> 11:44.069
We have plenty to do
for josie's campaign.
We're helping, liv.

11:44.071 --> 11:45.737
No doubt.
Of course.

11:45.739 --> 11:48.006
Over a cliff, I know.

11:48.008 --> 11:51.810
But this... (sighs)

11:55.114 --> 11:57.982
There's one other person
involved--

11:57.984 --> 12:02.087
The pilot my father ordered
to shoot down the plane.

12:06.225 --> 12:07.459
(projector and camera shutter
click)

12:12.364 --> 12:14.332
What do you want?

12:14.334 --> 12:16.301
At least give me credit
where credit is due.

12:16.303 --> 12:18.403
I don't know
what you're talking about.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.138
Oh, really? (scoffs)
you don't?

12:20.140 --> 12:22.073
Who said there was
something weird

12:22.075 --> 12:24.008
Going on with liv and her dad?
Who called that?

12:24.010 --> 12:26.277
I didn't
expect b613-level weird,

12:26.279 --> 12:28.113
But still, I was right.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.915
So I am more than just
some crazy adrenaline junkie.

12:30.917 --> 12:33.251
I  <i>am</i>interested
in things, huck,

12:33.253 --> 12:35.487
But for the right reasons.

12:39.158 --> 12:42.260
They're waiting for us
in the conference room.

12:42.262 --> 12:45.764
(huffs) fine.

12:53.405 --> 12:54.906
(papers rustle)

12:56.475 --> 12:59.244
That's weird. Flight 5-2-2--
it was cleared for takeoff

12:59.246 --> 13:01.379
But didn't leave dulles
for another 27 minutes.

13:01.381 --> 13:02.514
Flights are delayed
all the time.

13:02.516 --> 13:03.915
Yeah, but they're listed
as delayed.

13:03.917 --> 13:08.386
Look. The n.T.S.B. Report
shows the flight was overbooked.

13:08.388 --> 13:09.854
That's 322 passengers,

13:09.856 --> 13:12.490
6 crew members, 2 pilots,
330 people total.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.159
<i>But</i> when you look
at the flight manifest,

13:14.161 --> 13:16.394
Only 329 names.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.096
Let me see that.
Well, it could just be
that someone

13:18.098 --> 13:20.398
Ordered an extra seat.
Also possible
they made a mistake.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.467
Yeah, made a mistake or lied.
Congress always puts together

13:22.469 --> 13:27.205
Look at the name of the senator
who headed up this one.

13:27.207 --> 13:28.540
(projector and camera shutter
click)

13:28.542 --> 13:30.074
Fitzgerald grant ii?

13:30.076 --> 13:31.843
The president's father.

13:40.519 --> 13:43.154
I'll have one of those.

13:45.057 --> 13:47.525
(sighs)

13:51.197 --> 13:53.031
Who told you
not to join the navy?

13:53.033 --> 13:57.035
<i>Who told you not</i>
<i>to join the navy?</i>

13:57.037 --> 13:58.136
(clatter)
you did.

13:58.138 --> 14:01.873
You could've gone directly
from college into law school

14:01.875 --> 14:03.107
And then into
the justice department...
(bottle lid tightens)

14:03.109 --> 14:04.876
But, no, you had
these ridiculous notions--

14:04.878 --> 14:07.145
I wanted to fly planes.
Right.

14:07.147 --> 14:09.347
Right, right. No, you wanted
to prove something.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.549
You wanted to show everybody
what a man you were

14:11.551 --> 14:13.918
Because you weren't a man--
I wanted to serve my country.

14:13.920 --> 14:17.055
Doesn't need to run away
to the navy to--

14:17.057 --> 14:19.057
To get away from his daddy.

14:19.059 --> 14:22.093
A man stands up. A man does
what needs to be done!

14:22.095 --> 14:23.394
I stood up!

14:23.396 --> 14:25.496
I did what needed
to be done.

14:25.498 --> 14:28.566
You had no business signing up
for black ops missions.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.435
I aced flight school,
top of my class,

14:30.437 --> 14:33.104
They had me raising flags
and shaking hands.

14:33.106 --> 14:35.940
They had me on a desk.
You're a senator's son!

14:35.942 --> 14:38.343
You had a trust fund.
You're a damn grant!

14:38.345 --> 14:41.112
I was given the chance
to do something, to fly.

14:41.114 --> 14:42.881
And then I was given
an order.

14:42.883 --> 14:44.082
Grants don't take orders!

14:44.084 --> 14:47.252
You want me to campaign
on a lie.

14:47.254 --> 14:51.055
Fitz.

14:51.057 --> 14:54.125
You should be grateful
that this lie exists

14:54.127 --> 14:56.427
And just let it go.
(sips)

14:56.429 --> 14:58.196
Let it go?

14:58.198 --> 15:01.032
Should have been some poor kid
from some backwoods town

15:01.034 --> 15:03.935
Who shot that plane down,
not you, not my boy.

15:03.937 --> 15:06.337
(pours liquor)
but, no, you joined the navy
to   <i>spit</i>me,

15:06.339 --> 15:08.273
And then when you got
into all this mess,

15:08.275 --> 15:10.174
I covered your ass.

15:10.176 --> 15:12.110
I called in favors
to distance you

15:12.112 --> 15:15.146
As far away from that incident
as I could.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.615
So now it's time
for you to pay the piper.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.150
I own you.
(door closes in distance)

15:19.152 --> 15:20.618
You have a future,
thanks to me.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.187
I think cyrus beene
is about to leave. Quit, even.

15:23.189 --> 15:26.124
I don't know what to do.
Maybe, big jerry, you can--
I won't run on a lie.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.258
What else you have
to run on?

15:27.260 --> 15:28.459
What else
have you accomplished?

15:28.461 --> 15:30.328
The only other thing
you got going for you

15:30.330 --> 15:32.330
Is that you're my son.
That's it.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.098
That's all you are--my son,

15:34.100 --> 15:36.401
Not as smart,
not as interesting,

15:36.403 --> 15:38.036
But my son just the same.

15:38.038 --> 15:39.504
I made you!

15:39.506 --> 15:44.142
So you'll do what you're told,
and that's an order.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.077
(sips)

15:46.079 --> 15:48.279
Grants don't take orders.

15:50.149 --> 15:52.183
Don't walk away from me!

15:52.185 --> 15:54.619
You wanna serve,
run for governor!

15:59.091 --> 16:00.258
Oh.

16:00.260 --> 16:02.593
Sorry.
Any news?

16:02.595 --> 16:08.166
Whatever the cover-up was,
he was probably part of it.

16:08.168 --> 16:09.334
I think this might be
bigger than we think.

16:09.336 --> 16:11.502
My father's still the one
who gave the order.

16:11.504 --> 16:15.606
If anyone saw anything
that day at the airport--
we're tracking down

16:15.608 --> 16:17.275
The gate agent
who worked the flight.

16:18.711 --> 16:20.111
Good.

16:21.246 --> 16:23.247
That's good.

16:24.683 --> 16:26.117
Liv?

16:30.356 --> 16:32.156
What?

16:32.158 --> 16:34.325
(exhales sharply)

16:34.327 --> 16:37.528
I-I'm going to
hug you now.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.364
Don't--don't say anything.
Don't tell me not to,

16:39.366 --> 16:41.532
Because...
I'm going to hug you,

16:41.534 --> 16:43.701
And you're going to
stand here and take it.

16:56.248 --> 16:58.750
(projector and camera shutter
click)

16:58.752 --> 17:02.020
(heavy breathing)

17:13.065 --> 17:15.066
(gasp)

17:28.147 --> 17:30.615
I don't mind being stalked,
but it's getting cold out here.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.784
I-I just...

17:32.786 --> 17:35.420
I was looking for...
(gasps)

17:37.222 --> 17:40.291
(breathing heavily)

17:41.560 --> 17:44.629
Is that what
you were looking for?

17:46.098 --> 17:47.098
You wanna hang out
tomorrow night,

17:47.100 --> 17:48.800
You give me a call.

17:50.102 --> 17:53.104
(breathing heavily)

17:53.106 --> 17:55.206
(projector and camera shutter
click)

17:55.208 --> 17:59.177
(indistinct conversations,
phone ringing in distance)

17:59.179 --> 18:01.045
(gasps) sally, mind if I talk
to you for a minute?

18:01.047 --> 18:02.246
Of course.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.815
He's getting so big,
isn't he?

18:03.817 --> 18:06.851
He's huge. I wanted to talk
to you about daniel douglas.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.186
Mm.
One of my aides came to me
yesterday.

18:08.188 --> 18:13.124
Now I think I've handled it.
She's not gonna tell anyone--
your staffer's lying.

18:13.126 --> 18:15.159
I'm sorry?
Whatever she told you
isn't true.

18:15.161 --> 18:16.394
My husband keeps his hands
to himself.

18:16.396 --> 18:17.762
Are we ready, mrs. Grant?

18:17.764 --> 18:21.199
I'll let you get to it.
They do grow up so fast.

18:23.503 --> 18:26.871
And you bring teddy in to play
with his dad every night?

18:26.873 --> 18:28.139
Doesn't matter if
the president's in there

18:28.141 --> 18:29.373
With the whole cabinet.

18:29.375 --> 18:31.742
Kicking out
the defense secretary.

18:31.744 --> 18:36.414
(baby voice)
isn't that right, teddy bear?

18:36.416 --> 18:38.549
He would be a big, big
miserable daddy

18:38.551 --> 18:40.685
If we didn't show up,
wouldn't he? Hi!

18:40.687 --> 18:42.687
Ma'am.
Oh, here we go, here we go.

18:42.689 --> 18:44.689
¶ here we go, here we go

18:44.691 --> 18:47.125
What? What? (gasps)

18:49.194 --> 18:53.164
(sighs)

18:53.166 --> 18:54.866
(sighs)

18:54.868 --> 18:57.235
Well, looks like we missed him.

18:57.237 --> 19:02.640
The president
is just so... Busy. (laughs)

19:02.642 --> 19:07.245
Just a little disagreement.
A kerfuffle, a father/son thing.

19:07.247 --> 19:08.713
I don't do family drama,
mrs. Grant.

19:08.715 --> 19:10.381
I have enough of that
at home with my wife.

19:10.383 --> 19:12.583
But--
I'm a political warrior.
I slash, I burn.

19:12.585 --> 19:13.818
I kill. You want him
to be governor?

19:13.820 --> 19:16.187
You want him to run
the damn country one day?

19:16.189 --> 19:17.488
I will hand you that
on a platter.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.490
You want his hand held
or his nose wiped

19:19.492 --> 19:22.160
Or someone to hug him
and tell him that he's great,

19:22.162 --> 19:24.195
Do it yourself.
That's your job.

19:24.197 --> 19:27.732
I'm a lawyer.
I'm a partner in a law firm.

19:27.734 --> 19:34.805
You'll have to give that up.
They told you that, right?

19:34.807 --> 19:38.409
I'm--I'm gonna do
charity work, help people.

19:38.411 --> 19:40.444
Okay, I'm going to
give you a tip,

19:40.446 --> 19:42.747
And this is for free,
because I'm done.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.482
If he is going to be
governor,

19:44.484 --> 19:46.450
If he is going to be
a serious politician,

19:46.452 --> 19:48.886
If he's going to walk
the corridors of power,

19:48.888 --> 19:51.255
<i>He</i> is your charity work.

19:51.257 --> 19:54.458
<i>He</i> is your full-time job.

19:54.460 --> 19:57.261
You're the wife. Help him.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.701
I will take care of it.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.436
You come back tomorrow.

20:05.438 --> 20:08.206
I will deal with it. He will
be ready to work tomorrow.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.220
Do you have
a cocktail dress...

20:22.222 --> 20:23.287
No higher than the knee?

20:23.289 --> 20:27.558
Never mind, amber.
We'll send you something.
(beeps)

20:27.560 --> 20:29.360
(cell phone thuds)
(sighs) what's the problem?

20:29.362 --> 20:30.595
He promised he would
be in the oval.

20:30.597 --> 20:31.696
I looked like an idiot.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.564
I'm sure they'll
cut that part out.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.700
I am doing this whole
vanna white routine for him

20:35.702 --> 20:37.368
So that he has
a shot at re-election.

20:37.370 --> 20:39.403
He needs to at least
meet me halfway.

20:39.405 --> 20:40.671
Is he gonna
show up tomorrow...

20:40.673 --> 20:42.840
For the interview?
Of course he'll show up.

20:42.842 --> 20:44.442
Lauren has it
on his schedule.

20:44.444 --> 20:45.710
I know that he will
be there,

20:45.712 --> 20:48.679
But is he gonna
<i>show up</i> tomorrow?

20:48.681 --> 20:51.249
Honestly, mellie,
I don't know.

20:51.251 --> 20:53.918
(breathes unevenly)

20:53.920 --> 20:56.621
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

20:56.623 --> 21:01.726
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)
checking in all those people,
and then they were just gone.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.361
The flight was sold out but took
off with one empty seat.

21:03.363 --> 21:06.931
Called back to the gate
to say there were being held

21:06.933 --> 21:08.332
On the tarmac
by a federal marshal

21:08.334 --> 21:09.800
And someone was being
taken off the plane.

21:09.802 --> 21:12.336
Afterwards, I remember thinking
that person was so lucky.

21:12.338 --> 21:13.671
That wasn't mentioned
in the news reports.

21:13.673 --> 21:15.740
I told the n.T.S.B.
Investigator who interviewed me,

21:15.742 --> 21:17.475
But I never saw anything
about it anywhere.

21:17.477 --> 21:20.711
Did you see them--
the marshal and the passenger?

21:20.713 --> 21:22.280
It was way out on the tarmac.
It was nighttime.

21:22.282 --> 21:24.682
I'll never forget
that name, though--

21:24.684 --> 21:26.617
Of that guy
they took off the plane.

21:26.619 --> 21:30.688
Omar dresden--the passenger
taken off flight 522.

21:30.690 --> 21:32.823
They believe he died
in the crash.

21:32.825 --> 21:38.329
She didn't get a look at him,
and everyone else...
They dead.

21:38.331 --> 21:39.630
You can't just stop
a plane on the tarmac

21:39.632 --> 21:40.665
Of a commercial airport,
take someone off

21:40.667 --> 21:43.701
I could track which flights
were cleared at the same time.

21:43.703 --> 21:45.303
Good. Harrison, abby,
I want you to locate

21:45.305 --> 21:47.038
Every maintenance person,
baggage handler,

21:47.040 --> 21:48.406
Ground controller
who was on duty that night.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.007
Down to the guy
who restocks the peanuts--

21:50.009 --> 21:51.776
Anyone who may have had eyes
on omar dresden

21:51.778 --> 21:54.712
And this marshall.
(cell phone ringing)

21:54.714 --> 21:57.081
Hey.
What are you
doing tomorrow night?

21:57.083 --> 21:59.550
I thought I was supposed
to call <i>you.</i>

21:59.552 --> 22:01.752
Like I said, what are you
doing tomorrow night?

22:03.789 --> 22:05.556
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

22:05.558 --> 22:07.658
I heard from leo bergen
this morning.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.694
We're making some nice progress
on the financial front.

22:09.696 --> 22:11.562
Always knew
I liked that guy.

22:11.564 --> 22:13.664
Well, he said the timing
of my iowa trip

22:13.666 --> 22:15.533
Couldn't be more perfect.

22:15.535 --> 22:17.568
Face time with state leaders

22:17.570 --> 22:19.804
Is exactly what I need
to lock down more endorsements.

22:19.806 --> 22:22.540
Of course, now that
I'm preparing to run

22:22.542 --> 22:24.075
As an independent,

22:24.077 --> 22:26.377
We could face a good deal
more scrutiny--

22:26.379 --> 22:27.878
Who cassidy frequents with,

22:27.880 --> 22:29.847
Who... We frequent with.

22:29.849 --> 22:33.684
After all, our biggest strength
in this election

22:33.686 --> 22:35.720
Will be our family--

22:35.722 --> 22:37.088
Its values.

22:37.090 --> 22:38.789
It would be a shame
to lose them

22:38.791 --> 22:40.524
When we're so close
to the finish line.

22:40.526 --> 22:42.660
I understand.

22:42.662 --> 22:44.628
I have ever since you brought it
up the first time.

22:44.630 --> 22:46.063
Good.

22:46.065 --> 22:48.432
Then let's hope I don't ever
have to bring it up again.

22:48.434 --> 22:50.634
There.

22:50.636 --> 22:52.770
Perfect.

22:52.772 --> 22:55.973
He's hated me ever since
he was a kid.
(liquor pouring)

22:55.975 --> 22:57.842
(glass lid clinks)

22:57.844 --> 22:59.810
I'm a decent father!

22:59.812 --> 23:01.579
My father used to beat me.

23:01.581 --> 23:04.448
I don't beat him.
I'm a decent father, right?

23:04.450 --> 23:06.517
Yes, you are.

23:06.519 --> 23:09.487
Boys, you do--
you do what's best for them,

23:09.489 --> 23:10.654
And they don't appreciate it.

23:10.656 --> 23:11.989
Yeah, sure,
I slept around a bit.

23:11.991 --> 23:15.626
(glass clinks)
but his mother never knew.

23:15.628 --> 23:18.062
Before she died,
she didn't know.

23:18.064 --> 23:20.464
And he holds it against me--
saint fitz.

23:20.466 --> 23:22.533
Well, whatever it is
you're fighting about now,

23:22.535 --> 23:24.435
I'm sure we can find a way
to make it right.

23:24.437 --> 23:27.772
We have to, if we want
to get this campaign to happen.

23:27.774 --> 23:30.074
(fire crackling)

23:32.144 --> 23:33.878
(exhales)

23:33.880 --> 23:36.113
I'm gonna tell you something
that fewer than...

23:36.115 --> 23:38.716
20 people in this whole world
are aware of.

23:38.718 --> 23:42.553
Do you remember
global world flight 5-2-2?

23:42.555 --> 23:43.788
Of course.
What a tragedy.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.523
Yeah, fitz shot it down.

23:45.525 --> 23:48.692
I...

23:48.694 --> 23:49.894
Flight 5-2-2?

23:49.896 --> 23:51.195
Mm-hmm.

23:51.197 --> 23:55.132
No, he wasn't.
We had rock-solid intel.

23:55.134 --> 23:57.968
There was a--
a dirty bomb on board,

23:57.970 --> 24:00.137
And he was off the coast
of iceland.

24:00.139 --> 24:02.907
He got his orders,
and he shot it down.

24:02.909 --> 24:04.909
There were hundreds
of people on that plane.

24:04.911 --> 24:07.812
Did they all die?
Yeah, they did.

24:07.814 --> 24:09.814
But, hell, they would have
died anyway,

24:09.816 --> 24:12.016
If that plane had reached
its target.

24:12.018 --> 24:14.084
It could have taken out
half of london.

24:14.086 --> 24:15.786
Could have started
world war iii.

24:15.788 --> 24:18.589
They said there was
a mechanical failure.

24:18.591 --> 24:20.491
(chuckles)

24:20.493 --> 24:24.995
Well, that was a little
exercise in c.Y.A.--

24:24.997 --> 24:27.865
"cover your ass."

24:27.867 --> 24:30.568
You think the United States
government could shoot down

24:30.570 --> 24:32.603
A commercial airline
and just say,

24:32.605 --> 24:34.138
"oh, sorry for
the collateral damage...

24:34.140 --> 24:38.609
Sorry that we killed grandma
25 minutes early"?

24:38.611 --> 24:40.811
No, even if hitler himself
was on board,

24:40.813 --> 24:43.747
The lawsuits would have
dragged out for centuries.

24:43.749 --> 24:46.116
And don't even get me started
on the internationals.

24:46.118 --> 24:48.486
"mechanical failure"--
that's what you call it.

24:48.488 --> 24:50.921
And you know what it means,
unless you're naive.

24:50.923 --> 24:53.791
(sighs)

24:53.793 --> 24:56.193
You know, that boy's never been
grateful one day in his life

24:56.195 --> 24:58.028
For what he's got,
what he's been given.

24:58.030 --> 24:59.597
He's just too sensitive.

24:59.599 --> 25:02.500
He's got too many feelings.

25:02.502 --> 25:04.735
And that's why
he will never win.

25:07.606 --> 25:10.774
(crackling continues)

25:13.678 --> 25:15.613
(whispers) good god,
you're a beautiful woman.

25:15.615 --> 25:17.948
(sighs)

25:19.584 --> 25:21.051
Jerry.

25:21.053 --> 25:23.787
Okay, I don't think--
oh, shh, shh, shh.

25:23.789 --> 25:25.589
Stop! Jerry, stop!

25:25.591 --> 25:27.791
(whispers) do you really
want me to stop?

25:27.793 --> 25:28.893
(normal voice) hmm?

25:28.895 --> 25:30.694
Hmm?

25:30.696 --> 25:32.563
(gasps) no! Stop!
(grunting)

25:32.565 --> 25:35.599
<i>Stop!</i> Aah! Aah!

25:35.601 --> 25:38.068
No! No! No! (screams)
(grunts)

25:38.070 --> 25:39.303
(fabric rips)

25:39.305 --> 25:41.839
(grunting)
(screams)

25:41.841 --> 25:43.941
Uhh! Uhh!

25:46.077 --> 25:48.112
(breathing heavily)

25:48.114 --> 25:50.981
(grunts)
(whimpers)

25:55.186 --> 25:56.620
(grunts)

26:09.000 --> 26:10.734
Mellie?

26:10.736 --> 26:13.037
I sent lauren home.
She seemed tired.

26:13.039 --> 26:16.674
I've been running myself ragged
with that camera crew.

26:16.676 --> 26:18.976
You know, so I can make america
fall in love with me again.

26:18.978 --> 26:20.644
Because apparently I'm the one
they hate after your affair.

26:20.646 --> 26:23.113
It's late, mellie.

26:23.115 --> 26:26.617
I thought I'd try this--
you know, standing here.

26:26.619 --> 26:28.052
You and cyrus get to do it
all the time--

26:28.054 --> 26:31.755
I thought, "hey, let's get
some estrogen on this seal,

26:31.757 --> 26:32.823
See what happens."

26:32.825 --> 26:34.625
Okay. Now what's wrong?

26:34.627 --> 26:37.127
(chuckles) what's wrong?

26:37.129 --> 26:39.797
What's wrong?
What is wrong?

26:39.799 --> 26:42.232
This is my life.
That's what's wrong!

26:42.234 --> 26:44.068
This is my life--
mellie...

26:44.070 --> 26:46.604
You didn't show up...
For me.

26:46.606 --> 26:48.706
You didn't show up
for that stupid reporter

26:48.708 --> 26:51.141
And me and teddy
and that photo op in the oval.

26:51.143 --> 26:52.676
You left me hanging,

26:52.678 --> 26:54.078
And I had to do
everything myself.

26:54.080 --> 26:59.717
I am <i>tired</i> of doing
everything <i>myself!</i>

26:59.719 --> 27:01.085
I am alone here.

27:01.087 --> 27:02.686
We're supposed
to be partners.

27:02.688 --> 27:05.055
We are supposed
to be in this together.

27:05.057 --> 27:06.824
Let's not pretend
we're something we're not.

27:06.826 --> 27:08.792
(sighs)

27:08.794 --> 27:12.096
If you knew the sacrifices
that I have made--

27:12.098 --> 27:15.899
And the pieces of myself
that I have given away for you,

27:15.901 --> 27:18.202
And you treat me this way.

27:18.204 --> 27:21.372
You declare war on me,
and you shame me,

27:21.374 --> 27:23.874
And you make me beg
for scraps

27:23.876 --> 27:26.110
When I have done nothing
but fight for you.

27:34.853 --> 27:35.919
You don't have to love me.

27:35.921 --> 27:37.688
But we are in
this hell together,

27:37.690 --> 27:39.056
And the flames
are burning both of us

27:39.058 --> 27:41.659
With equal intensity, baby,
so the least you could do

27:41.661 --> 27:45.095
Is be my friend,
just a little bit.

27:45.097 --> 27:47.064
(voice breaking)
the least you could do

27:47.066 --> 27:49.266
Is   <i>show up...</i>

27:49.268 --> 27:52.069
Show up for <i>me.</i>

27:52.071 --> 27:55.105
Show up for me, fitz...

27:59.144 --> 28:01.912
Instead of being
like some...

28:01.914 --> 28:04.014
(under breath) some...

28:06.718 --> 28:08.018
Stranger.

28:29.274 --> 28:32.176
(floorboard creaks)

28:32.178 --> 28:33.077
Mels?

28:33.079 --> 28:34.445
(creaking continues)

28:34.447 --> 28:37.948
Where you been?

28:37.950 --> 28:39.817
(shaky voice) uh...

28:39.819 --> 28:42.986
I was talking
to my father on the phone.

28:42.988 --> 28:45.022
In asheville?

28:45.024 --> 28:46.990
Yeah, he was up late.

28:46.992 --> 28:49.193
He wanted to say "hey"
to his baby girl.

28:49.195 --> 28:52.129
I really just want
to take a shower first.

28:52.131 --> 28:53.197
No, come here.

28:53.199 --> 28:55.265
No, I really need--
no, come here.

29:02.974 --> 29:04.775
(grunts)
(moans)

29:07.979 --> 29:10.781
We should just
go home tomorrow.

29:10.783 --> 29:13.817
Screw the governor's mansion.
Let's just...

29:13.819 --> 29:15.886
Go home.

29:15.888 --> 29:18.455
Yeah, let's do that.

29:18.457 --> 29:21.859
Just once...

29:21.861 --> 29:23.894
Just once I wish my father
would apologize

29:23.896 --> 29:26.063
And be on my side--
just once.

29:26.065 --> 29:28.465
(scoffs)

29:28.467 --> 29:31.335
If he did that...

29:31.337 --> 29:34.004
If he just admitted...

29:37.942 --> 29:42.146
I think I'd make
a hell of a governor.

29:42.148 --> 29:43.847
Yeah, you would.

29:51.990 --> 29:53.991
I know it's late notice.
I just found out myself.

29:53.993 --> 29:55.325
The president said
it's a big emergency

29:55.327 --> 29:58.128
With the I.M.F. And kurdistan
or greece or...

29:58.130 --> 30:00.063
(sighs) I don't know.

30:00.065 --> 30:01.865
By then my eyes started
to glaze over.

30:01.867 --> 30:04.001
Maybe we can try tomorrow
or the next day?

30:04.003 --> 30:05.235
When's this whole thing
supposed to air?

30:05.237 --> 30:07.204
This Sunday,
so even if we do it tomorrow,

30:07.206 --> 30:08.539
It's cutting it kind of close
editing-wise.

30:08.541 --> 30:11.308
He's very sorry.
What am I sorry about?

30:11.310 --> 30:15.245
Fitz! I thought you had
that emergency with kurdistan.

30:15.247 --> 30:17.314
Between kurdistan and carla?
Come on. That's a no-brainer.

30:17.316 --> 30:20.083
What do you say? Ready to get
this show on the road?

30:20.085 --> 30:23.587
Mrs. Grant, I'm sure
you're aware of the effect

30:23.589 --> 30:25.289
All of this has had
on your popularity

30:25.291 --> 30:26.924
Amongst the american people.

30:26.926 --> 30:29.193
I don't really read the polls.

30:29.195 --> 30:30.561
In that case,
allow me to summarize.

30:30.563 --> 30:32.529
The american people--
nearly half of them

30:32.531 --> 30:35.432
Now question whether they want
you representing them at all.

30:35.434 --> 30:37.201
That's not really
what the polls suggest.

30:37.203 --> 30:39.069
So you <i>do</i> read the polls?

30:39.071 --> 30:41.104
(chuckles)

30:41.106 --> 30:43.106
On occasion. (chuckles)

30:43.108 --> 30:45.075
Then you know that close
to a third of americans

30:45.077 --> 30:46.443
Now even question
your sanity...

30:46.445 --> 30:49.980
Your emotional stability.

30:49.982 --> 30:52.115
I understand their frustration.
I do--

30:52.117 --> 30:53.450
What do you say to them?

30:53.452 --> 30:55.586
How do you explain
what drove you to make

30:55.588 --> 30:58.288
The rash decision
to go on national television

30:58.290 --> 31:00.357
And air
your marital dirty laundry

31:00.359 --> 31:02.993
In front of the entire world?

31:07.232 --> 31:09.166
(sighs)

31:09.168 --> 31:12.302
What do I say to them?

31:15.273 --> 31:17.207
I say they're barking
up the wrong tree.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.442
With all due respect,
mr. President,

31:18.444 --> 31:20.244
That was a question
for the first lady.

31:20.246 --> 31:21.912
With all due respect, carla,
that wasn't a question.

31:21.914 --> 31:23.380
It was an attack.
Sir--

31:23.382 --> 31:25.382
Ask my wife anything
you want.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.251
She is more than capable
of handling herself.

31:27.253 --> 31:28.952
But if you want
to attack her--

31:28.954 --> 31:30.187
To treat her like
a witness on the stand--

31:30.189 --> 31:31.588
You're gonna have to go
through me first.

31:31.590 --> 31:34.892
Mr. President--
<i>I</i> had the affair.

31:34.894 --> 31:36.360
I damaged our marriage

31:36.362 --> 31:38.195
And caused
the public grief,

31:38.197 --> 31:40.130
And I should be
the sole carrier

31:40.132 --> 31:43.133
Of the blame and outrage
for this embarrassing fiasco.

31:43.135 --> 31:44.668
To place it elsewhere--

31:44.670 --> 31:47.137
To blame mellie
for speaking out--is false.

31:47.139 --> 31:48.305
For mellie to accept
that blame

31:48.307 --> 31:49.606
And to take responsibility
for any of it

31:49.608 --> 31:51.074
Would be equally false.

31:51.076 --> 31:53.310
<i>I</i> made the mistake.

31:53.312 --> 31:55.345
I've apologized for it.

31:55.347 --> 31:58.248
And now it is time.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.183
I am moving on.

32:00.185 --> 32:04.087
We are both trying
to move on.

32:05.323 --> 32:07.224
And all we can ask
is that the american people

32:07.226 --> 32:07.557
Try to do the same.

32:11.362 --> 32:13.530
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

32:13.532 --> 32:15.299
What do we have
on omar dresden?

32:15.301 --> 32:16.633
Noting yet, but we've got
a good lead.

32:16.635 --> 32:18.135
We found the guy
who was driving the stairs

32:18.137 --> 32:20.337
He would have seen dresden
being taken off the plane.

32:20.339 --> 32:23.106
When are we talking to him?
He's working tonight,

32:23.108 --> 32:24.207
But he said I could come by.

32:24.209 --> 32:27.344
Good. Keep on it.

32:33.651 --> 32:35.185
A lot nicer inside the car,
am I right?

32:35.187 --> 32:37.187
Yeah.

32:43.127 --> 32:46.096
I gotta--I gotta go in there
and snag that file tonight.

32:46.098 --> 32:48.131
I've been here since 4:00.
He hasn't moved.

32:48.133 --> 32:50.100
The guy's got...
A bladder made of steel.

32:50.102 --> 32:51.268
(chuckles)

32:53.037 --> 32:55.272
(exhales deeply) oh.
(velcro rips)

32:55.274 --> 32:57.140
Really didn't want
to have to use these.

32:57.142 --> 32:58.241
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

32:58.243 --> 33:00.043
Is that m99?

33:00.045 --> 33:02.746
I just use enough
to put him to sleep

33:02.748 --> 33:04.281
Until we can get out
of there.

33:04.283 --> 33:06.049
You think you can disable
the security cameras?

33:06.051 --> 33:08.418
Or you want to do
the fun job?

33:08.420 --> 33:11.355
(chuckles) I'm just kidding.
Huck would kill me.

33:11.357 --> 33:14.157
Huck let me torture
someone once.

33:14.159 --> 33:16.493
I got what he needed.

33:43.288 --> 33:46.123
Worst thing you can do
is jump the gun.

33:46.125 --> 33:48.225
(exhales)

33:48.227 --> 33:50.260
Let me put you on hold
for a second, honey.

33:52.663 --> 33:54.531
I'm supposed to be picking
something up for my boss.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.099
Um, 15th floor?

33:56.101 --> 33:57.634
Kline pharmaceuticals?
That's it.

33:57.636 --> 33:59.136
I'm pretty sure everyone's
gone for the night.

33:59.138 --> 34:00.504
Mind signing in
while I call up?

34:03.207 --> 34:05.242
Do you have another pen?
I think this one's dead.

34:05.244 --> 34:06.777
Um...

34:11.182 --> 34:12.649
Here, try this one.
(grunts)

34:12.651 --> 34:15.052
(strained voice) hey!
(grunts)

34:15.054 --> 34:17.320
(breathing heavily)

34:21.759 --> 34:23.160
All clear. It's done.

34:23.162 --> 34:24.594
Come now.

34:24.596 --> 34:28.165
Wait. Charlie?

34:28.167 --> 34:30.834
(gasping)

34:32.170 --> 34:33.603
(choking)
(gasps)

34:33.605 --> 34:35.138
(thuds)
oh, my god!

34:35.140 --> 34:36.706
Oh, my god.
(whispers) oh, my god.

34:36.708 --> 34:39.142
(panting)

34:39.144 --> 34:40.510
No.

34:40.512 --> 34:43.146
(grunting)

34:43.148 --> 34:44.848
(gasps) no!

34:44.850 --> 34:47.284
(whispers) oh, god!
(grunts)

34:47.286 --> 34:48.685
(panting)

34:48.687 --> 34:50.387
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

34:53.324 --> 34:56.393
(breathing unevenly)

35:06.704 --> 35:09.739
(birds chirping in distance)

35:13.211 --> 35:15.645
Good morning.
Morning.

35:19.817 --> 35:21.418
Thank you.
(saucer thuds)

35:29.727 --> 35:31.661
I know things got a little
out of hand last night--

35:31.663 --> 35:33.730
Don't mention it.
No, I'm sorry.
I would hate for it--

35:33.732 --> 35:36.733
I said don't mention it.
I know I won't.

35:36.735 --> 35:39.302
Instead, we should talk
about something else--

35:39.304 --> 35:41.538
Something like how when fitz
comes down for breakfast,

35:41.540 --> 35:43.807
You will take him aside
and tell him whatever it is

35:43.809 --> 35:49.513
Not how ungrateful he is
or sensitive or doomed to fail.

35:49.515 --> 35:51.548
You will tell him
what he needs to hear--

35:51.550 --> 35:53.917
How proud you are of him,

35:53.919 --> 35:57.420
How sorry you are for being
such a bad father.

35:57.422 --> 35:59.156
You will tell him

35:59.158 --> 36:00.690
That he doesn't have to run
on his military record,

36:00.692 --> 36:02.726
At least not yet.

36:02.728 --> 36:05.262
You will get him back
on track,

36:05.264 --> 36:08.431
Support him, support us.

36:14.605 --> 36:16.773
You... Are an asset.

36:16.775 --> 36:20.177
I am his <i>wife.</i>

36:20.179 --> 36:21.745
(footsteps approach)

36:21.747 --> 36:23.713
You all packed?
We should get going.

36:23.715 --> 36:25.415
Let's just have
a bite of breakfast first.

36:25.417 --> 36:28.585
Your father says he wants
to apologize to you...

36:29.654 --> 36:32.289
Don't you, big jerry?

36:33.791 --> 36:35.892
(carla) are you two ready
to go out there?

36:35.894 --> 36:38.662
And shake
a couple hundred hands? You bet.

36:38.664 --> 36:42.299
To double-down on the whole
"strong handshake" mandate

36:42.301 --> 36:43.366
When they meet the president.

36:43.368 --> 36:44.601
I just wish I could
wear gloves.

36:44.603 --> 36:45.969
Jackie kennedy had it easy.

36:45.971 --> 36:48.838
Well... Not that easy.
You'll cut that part out, right?

36:48.840 --> 36:50.407
Yes, mr. President.
(sighs and chuckles
nervously)

36:50.409 --> 36:51.575
Can I have some more powder,
please?
Yes, sir.

36:51.577 --> 36:55.345
Helps with the sweaty palms.
Thank you.

36:55.347 --> 36:57.714
You have enough?
We're good.

36:57.716 --> 36:59.716
Thanks, guys.
Thank you.

37:03.287 --> 37:04.754
(sighs)

37:04.756 --> 37:06.823
Hell of a performance
in that interview, by the way.

37:06.825 --> 37:08.692
Going on the attack--

37:08.694 --> 37:10.527
Smart choice.

37:10.529 --> 37:11.828
It wasn't a choice.

37:11.830 --> 37:13.563
I meant every word.

37:13.565 --> 37:15.966
(man, amplified voice)
ladies and gentlemen,

37:15.968 --> 37:18.635
The president and first lady
of the United States.

37:18.637 --> 37:21.838
(applause)
well, let's get
this over with, shall we?

37:21.840 --> 37:24.708
(lou rawls' "you'll never find
another love like mine" playing)

37:24.710 --> 37:27.510
(applause continues)

37:27.512 --> 37:30.647
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

37:30.649 --> 37:34.551
(indistinct conversations)

37:35.853 --> 37:37.954
¶ you'll never find

37:39.490 --> 37:41.625
We need to talk.

37:41.627 --> 37:45.629
Please, not now.
Yes, now.
<i>We have to talk.</i>

37:45.631 --> 37:48.498
Fine. You wanna know why you
didn't get the big interview?

37:48.500 --> 37:49.799
Because you got your ass
handed to you

37:49.801 --> 37:51.701
By that featherweight
josie marcus.

37:51.703 --> 37:53.703
That's not--
which might have been okay
on its own.

37:53.705 --> 37:55.272
But since you're
already famous

37:55.274 --> 37:56.673
For your softball mellie
interview--

37:56.675 --> 37:58.275
Where you neglected
to ask the hard questions

37:58.277 --> 37:59.542
That carla steele
asked today--

37:59.544 --> 38:01.311
Your integrity took a hit.
Cyrus!

38:01.313 --> 38:02.612
What?!
I got fired.

38:02.614 --> 38:03.880
¶ you'll never find

38:03.882 --> 38:05.782
You... You got--

38:05.784 --> 38:07.550
About an hour ago.

38:07.552 --> 38:09.619
I got an e-mail.
Honey...

38:09.621 --> 38:11.388
Thanks for the pep talk.

38:11.390 --> 38:13.423
¶ who needs you
james...

38:13.425 --> 38:14.457
(sighs)

38:14.459 --> 38:15.792
¶ like I do

38:15.794 --> 38:18.461
What, no luck?
I could try again.

38:18.463 --> 38:20.664
No. Thanks, amber.

38:21.766 --> 38:23.633
Well?
No dice.

38:23.635 --> 38:26.036
(sighs) maybe she's not
his type.

38:26.038 --> 38:30.440
¶ you'll keep searching
and searching ¶

38:30.442 --> 38:31.675
Hold it.

38:31.677 --> 38:35.612
¶ oh, I don't wish you
no bad luck, baby ¶

38:35.614 --> 38:37.681
¶ ahh, ahh

38:37.683 --> 38:39.816
¶ but there's no "ifs"
and "buts" ¶

38:39.818 --> 38:42.485
¶ or "maybes"

38:42.487 --> 38:43.653
¶ you're gonna miss my loving

38:43.655 --> 38:46.623
She's not his type.

38:46.625 --> 38:48.658
Mnh-mnh.
¶ you're gonna miss my loving

38:48.660 --> 38:50.927
¶ I know you're gonna
miss my loving ¶

38:50.929 --> 38:52.662
(projector and camera shutter
click)
¶ I know, I know, I know

38:52.664 --> 38:54.030
(door closes)
(fitz)
anything I should know, mike?

38:54.032 --> 38:55.932
Typical week.
Swims at 0600.

38:55.934 --> 38:58.368
Arrives back at the office
at 0800.

38:58.370 --> 39:01.404
Departs 10 to 12 hours later,
heads straight home.

39:01.406 --> 39:04.040
Doesn't seem to be
in any imminent danger, sir.
(projector and camera shutter
click)

39:04.042 --> 39:05.108
She is.

39:05.110 --> 39:06.743
<i>Stay on him.</i>

39:08.045 --> 39:09.546
Inmate you're visiting?

39:09.548 --> 39:11.815
Omar dresden.

39:11.817 --> 39:13.416
(projector and camera shutter
click)

39:13.418 --> 39:14.551
(siren wailing)

39:14.553 --> 39:16.720
Hey.
Something's not right here.

39:16.722 --> 39:18.088
What do you mean?

39:19.457 --> 39:20.724
Jake?

39:20.726 --> 39:22.592
<i>Jake?</i>

39:22.594 --> 39:23.927
Talk to me.

39:27.698 --> 39:29.966
(projector and camera shutter
click)

39:29.968 --> 39:32.402
(sobbing)

39:32.404 --> 39:34.671
Oh, come on, huck.
Please.

39:34.673 --> 39:37.741
Is that a call
you really wanna make?

39:37.743 --> 39:39.376
'cause I got a feeling

39:39.378 --> 39:42.145
He's gonna be tremendously
disappointed in you.

39:42.147 --> 39:44.080
(dog barking in distance)

39:45.683 --> 39:48.718
You belong to b613 now.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.520
Welcome to wonderland.

39:52.089 --> 39:53.423
(projector and camera shutter
click)

39:53.425 --> 39:54.758
(fitz)
anything on the mother?

39:54.760 --> 39:55.892
(mike) not much to find.

39:55.894 --> 39:57.694
Before dying
on global world 5-2-2,

39:57.696 --> 40:00.730
Maya pope worked as a secretary
to a venture capitalist

40:00.732 --> 40:03.733
Named neal hastings.
(beeps)

40:08.038 --> 40:09.406
He's dead, liv--

40:09.408 --> 40:10.840
The guy that drove
the stairs,

40:10.842 --> 40:12.976
Our only link
to omar dresden.

40:12.978 --> 40:15.044
Someone's way ahead of us.

40:15.046 --> 40:16.946
It's gotta be my father.

40:16.948 --> 40:18.681
One child, olivia.

40:18.683 --> 40:20.617
Husband, elijah,
eight years her senior.

40:20.619 --> 40:23.086
Works at the smithsonian.
Hard guy to get a picture of.

40:23.088 --> 40:27.757
But I finally found an old copy
of his museum badge.

40:27.759 --> 40:30.660
(projector and camera shutter
click)

40:30.662 --> 40:32.996
Her father?
That's him.

40:40.070 --> 40:42.739
Strangers...

40:42.741 --> 40:44.474
(door beeps)

40:47.711 --> 40:49.779
(clears throat)

40:51.749 --> 40:53.783
Our daughter's been asking
about you.

41:02.726 --> 41:04.694
(glass clinks)
(chuckles)

41:04.696 --> 41:08.064
Uh, everyone, uh, could I have
your attention for a moment?

41:08.066 --> 41:10.633
Fitz and I would like
to thank

41:10.635 --> 41:11.935
Everyone who signed on
to the campaign

41:11.937 --> 41:13.536
In the last few weeks.

41:13.538 --> 41:17.240
I know we have a long,
hard journey ahead of us,

41:17.242 --> 41:19.242
But before we start off,

41:19.244 --> 41:22.679
I just wanna tell you
how lucky I feel

41:22.681 --> 41:26.149
To be a part
of this amazing group of people,

41:26.151 --> 41:27.884
