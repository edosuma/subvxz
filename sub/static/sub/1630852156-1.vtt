<i>It's a huge two-month expedition</i>
<i>just to climb one 8,000-meter peak.</i>

03:19.680 --> 03:22.200
<i>But sometime in the spring of 2019,</i>

03:22.280 --> 03:27.080
<i>the mountaineering world started talking</i>

03:27.160 --> 03:29.360
<i>[music continues]</i>

03:35.400 --> 03:37.680
<i>He was someone</i>
<i>that nobody had ever heard of.</i>

<i>Everyone was asking,</i>

03:44.200 --> 03:46.360
<i>"Who the hell is Nims Purja?"</i>

03:46.440 --> 03:48.120
<i>All right, mate.</i>

<i>[Nims]</i> The fastest time to climb

<i>I want to represent</i>
<i>the Nepalese climbing community.</i>

04:39.840 --> 04:42.760
<i>My mission was divided into three phases.</i>

04:44.960 --> 04:46.960
<i>Phase 1 would be Nepal.</i>

04:50.040 --> 04:53.400
<i>I would need to be</i>
<i>the first climber in history</i>

04:54.040 --> 04:58.040
<i>to summit six 8,000-meter peaks</i>
<i>in the spring season.</i>

05:04.680 --> 05:06.920
<i>Phase 2 would be in Pakistan,</i>

05:08.360 --> 05:11.400
<i>where I would need to summit K2,</i>

05:11.480 --> 05:14.040
<i>and you've got to be lucky</i>
<i>to survive that mountain.</i>

05:15.920 --> 05:19.080
<i>And for Phase 3,</i>
<i>I would need to get permission</i>

05:19.160 --> 05:21.840
<i>from the Chinese government</i>
<i>to climb in Tibet.</i>

05:23.360 --> 05:26.240
<i>I was told that my plan was impossible.</i>

<i>[helicopter engine humming]</i>

<i>[Mingma in Nepali]</i>
I've been a mountaineer for 10 years.

<i>I've been involved</i>
<i>in more than 100 rescues.</i>

17:22.400 --> 17:25.640
<i>[Geljen] </i>We were tired
and didn't have much energy.

17:29.880 --> 17:33.120
<i>I was scared about how the helicopter</i>

17:33.200 --> 17:37.240
<i>would drop us from above.</i>
<i>I was very nervous.</i>

17:37.320 --> 17:39.920
<i>[tense music continues]</i>

17:56.920 --> 18:00.280
<i>[Don in English]</i> Bravery doesn't

<i>what those guys had to do to go back up.</i>

18:07.080 --> 18:10.440
<i>You finally summit one of</i>
<i>the most dangerous mountains in the world,</i>

18:10.520 --> 18:12.640
<i>and now you gotta go back up there?</i>

18:18.400 --> 18:20.000
<i>It is a roll of the dice.</i>

18:21.000 --> 18:23.400
<i>[tense music continues]</i>

18:45.880 --> 18:47.040
<i>[Nims, muffled] Hello!</i>

18:48.440 --> 18:50.840
<i>Your friends are here, okay?</i>

18:50.920 --> 18:52.160
<i>You go home now.</i>

18:52.240 --> 18:54.720
<i>Don't worry.</i>
<i>Oxygen, oxygen, we'll give oxygen.</i>

18:54.800 --> 18:55.800
<i>[in Nepali] Quick, quick!</i>

18:56.520 --> 18:59.000
<i>[in English] </i>Every second

19:01.720 --> 19:04.440
<i>We knew that the helicopter</i>
<i>couldn't come at night.</i>

19:07.160 --> 19:11.360
<i>So, we had to get him down</i>
<i>to Camp 4 as fast as possible.</i>

19:12.960 --> 19:13.960
<i>You're very strong!</i>

19:17.200 --> 19:18.400
<i>We go home, okay?</i>

<i>[somber music playing]</i>

<i>[in Nepali] Gesman, make a pillow for him.</i>

<i>[in English]</i> That night we just had
to slap ourself to keep us awake,

<i>and we just took him</i>
<i>down to Camp 3 at 6:00 a.m.</i>

19:44.560 --> 19:46.760
<i>Only five minutes before</i>
<i>the helicopter came.</i>

19:47.640 --> 19:49.240
<i>[helicopter whirring]</i>

19:56.760 --> 20:00.600
<i>[Don] </i>I immediately went over

<i>He was alive and breathing, but barely.</i>

20:11.520 --> 20:15.200
<i>[Nims]</i> We had to get him
to the hospital as soon as possible.

20:31.880 --> 20:34.800
<i>[Don]</i> Those guys were really,
really risking their lives.

20:36.200 --> 20:39.240

<i>[birds chirping]</i>

20:59.520 --> 21:02.840
<i>This is the house that I grew up as a kid.</i>

<i>-[in Nepali] Hello. Are you well?</i>
<i>-Yes, we are.</i>

21:07.040 --> 21:08.960
<i>[Nims in English]</i>
<i>The security is very tight here.</i>

21:09.040 --> 21:10.640
<i>Mum used to lock this, you know,</i>

21:10.720 --> 21:13.080
<i>so there were no</i>
<i>nights out and stuff. You know?</i>

21:14.640 --> 21:17.880
<i>Hello, hello! Mummy?</i>

21:21.240 --> 21:24.320
<i>I was born in a poor family.</i>

21:25.400 --> 21:27.960
<i>My mum and dad gave everything for us.</i>

21:28.920 --> 21:32.120
<i>Hello, Mum. Thank you. Thank you.</i>

21:32.200 --> 21:36.080
<i>My mum wasn't a soft mum.</i>
<i>She was tough for a reason.</i>

21:38.400 --> 21:40.360
<i>I was always getting into trouble.</i>

21:41.160 --> 21:44.720
<i>There wasn't a single day</i>
<i>where I wasn't beaten by the teacher.</i>

21:44.800 --> 21:46.760
<i>[laughing]</i> Because I was a naughty boy.

21:51.720 --> 21:55.960
<i>[Kamal]</i> Because he had three
older brothers, he was very competitive.

21:58.520 --> 21:59.680
<i>He was a fighter.</i>

22:01.280 --> 22:02.600
<i>If there is any challenge,</i>

22:02.680 --> 22:05.800
<i>he wanted to face,</i>
<i>and then he wanted to win.</i>

22:08.800 --> 22:11.920
<i>[Nims]</i> Four years ago,
my dad had a heart attack

22:12.000 --> 22:14.040
<i>which made him half-paralyzed.</i>

22:15.000 --> 22:16.640
<i>He had been a Gurkha.</i>

22:18.680 --> 22:21.360
<i>[narrator]</i> Considered one of
the toughest fighting men in the world,

22:21.440 --> 22:25.480
<i>Gurkha regiments have fought valiantly</i>
<i>in the British army for many years.</i>

22:25.560 --> 22:26.920
<i>[machine gun firing]</i>

22:27.000 --> 22:29.560
<i>[Nims]</i> In Nepal,
you had limited opportunities.

22:30.760 --> 22:33.440
<i>Being a Gurkha meant</i>
<i>you could travel the world.</i>

22:34.160 --> 22:35.440
<i>[automatic gunfire]</i>

22:36.600 --> 22:39.360
<i>The Gurkhas are steeped in history,</i>

22:40.280 --> 22:42.080
<i>and they're unique soldiers.</i>

22:44.200 --> 22:45.640
<i>The amount of effort that individuals</i>

22:45.720 --> 22:49.040
<i>put into getting</i>
<i>into the selection process is huge.</i>

22:49.120 --> 22:50.000
<i>[man] Go!</i>

22:51.840 --> 22:53.920
<i>[panting]</i>

22:54.000 --> 22:57.680
<i>[military colleague]</i> So they've always
had that additional layer of pride.

23:01.880 --> 23:05.360
<i>[Nims]</i> In early life, I always used
to compete against other people.

23:05.440 --> 23:07.160
<i>I never knew how to back off.</i>

23:08.200 --> 23:10.200
<i>[military leader shouting in Nepali]</i>

23:13.280 --> 23:16.240
<i>[Nims] </i>When I joined the Gurkhas,
the biggest thing I learned

23:16.320 --> 23:19.360
<i>was I have to compete against myself.</i>

23:21.000 --> 23:23.080
<i>To be better than who I was yesterday.</i>

23:30.240 --> 23:32.040
<i>[speaking Nepali]</i>

23:32.920 --> 23:35.440
<i>My mum is in really ill health.</i>

<i>She has to go to hospital twice a week.</i>

23:42.640 --> 23:44.240
<i>Me being the youngest son,</i>

<i>I have always been Mum's boy.</i>

23:48.640 --> 23:50.640
<i>[speaking indistinctly]</i>

23:51.840 --> 23:53.200
<i>[Nims] </i>I need her support

23:54.240 --> 23:58.280
<i>because this is the biggest challenge</i>
<i>I have ever taken.</i>

24:01.800 --> 24:05.000
<i>[Mum in Nepali] There is no one</i>
<i>more special than you in this world, son.</i>

24:05.560 --> 24:07.360
<i>Bless you.</i>

24:10.600 --> 24:11.800
<i>[Kamal]</i> Nirmal was telling us,

24:11.880 --> 24:17.080
<i>"I want to climb to show Mum</i>
<i>what your son can do because of you."</i>

24:21.520 --> 24:23.320
<i>[Nims] What did I get from my mum?</i>

24:24.720 --> 24:25.720
<i>A lot, man.</i>

24:26.760 --> 24:29.240
<i>Yeah. A lot of things.</i>

24:40.280 --> 24:42.280
<i>[soft music playing]</i>

24:53.520 --> 24:57.320
<i>Coming from Nepal, I knew</i>
<i>that I had the best team in the world.</i>

25:00.600 --> 25:03.200
<i>I made sure they were paid more money</i>

25:03.280 --> 25:06.400
<i>than they would get</i>
<i>from a Western expedition.</i>

25:08.880 --> 25:11.520
<i>Climbing eight-thousanders</i>
<i>is also a chance</i>

25:11.600 --> 25:13.800
<i>for them to build their careers.</i>

25:16.440 --> 25:20.080
<i>[in Nepali] </i>Nepali mountaineers have
a long history of mountaineering,

25:20.960 --> 25:24.160
<i>but when it comes to taking the lead</i>
<i>on the international platform,</i>

25:25.080 --> 25:29.120
<i>we haven't been able to reach that level.</i>

25:31.400 --> 25:34.080
<i>There is a big difference between climbing</i>

25:34.160 --> 25:36.400
<i>for a foreign mountaineer</i>
<i>and a Nepali one.</i>

25:37.720 --> 25:42.360
<i>We are immensely proud</i>
<i>that our leader is Nepali.</i>

25:50.160 --> 25:52.520
<i>[Nims in English]</i>
We started making good progress,

25:52.600 --> 25:59.120
<i>but in the distance, I could see</i>
<i>a huge cloud cover coming towards us.</i>

26:01.600 --> 26:03.600
<i>[wind gusting]</i>

26:13.440 --> 26:16.120
<i>We were carrying a really heavy pack.</i>

26:17.240 --> 26:21.160
<i>We had to take our tent,</i>
<i>oxygen tanks, the rope, everything.</i>

26:26.200 --> 26:29.680
<i>You got to question yourself.</i>
<i>Are you doing the right thing?</i>

26:34.200 --> 26:38.400
<i>[in Nepali]</i> At that stage,
we were climbing despite the fear.

26:40.680 --> 26:44.640
<i>One wrong move and we were gone.</i>
<i>It was that kind of a situation.</i>

26:46.640 --> 26:48.640
<i>[wind whooshing]</i>

26:50.240 --> 26:53.520
<i>[Nims in English]</i> I said to them,
"Guys, this is my idea."

26:55.320 --> 26:59.280
<i>"If you feel like it's stupid</i>
<i>and if you feel like you're gonna die,</i>

26:59.360 --> 27:00.840
<i>you don't have to come with me."</i>

27:04.720 --> 27:06.320
<i>But they kept going.</i>

27:07.840 --> 27:08.720
<i>Yeah!</i>

27:15.480 --> 27:18.240
<i>We left for the summit push at 9:00 p.m.</i>

<i>[wind gusting]</i>

<i>the next morning.</i>

27:29.280 --> 27:31.280
<i>[breathing heavily]</i>

27:39.280 --> 27:42.520
<i>We summitted around</i>
<i>6:00 p.m. the next day.</i>

27:44.240 --> 27:46.560
<i>It took 21 hours.</i>

27:48.080 --> 27:51.320
<i>One of the hardest things</i>
<i>I have ever done.</i>

27:51.400 --> 27:52.240
<i>Yeah.</i>

27:53.760 --> 27:56.080
<i>[cheering]</i>

28:01.800 --> 28:02.880
<i>Oh.</i>

28:03.680 --> 28:06.480
<i>Oh, man. Pure by force today.</i>

28:07.040 --> 28:10.760
<i>If the team were not equally good,</i>
<i>no summit.</i>

28:10.840 --> 28:12.280
<i>Very tired today.</i>

28:15.160 --> 28:17.400
<i>-Yeah, summit day!</i>
<i>-[Geljen] Yup.</i>

28:17.480 --> 28:18.760
<i>[gags, laughs]</i>

<i>He doesn't drink normally. So thanks, man.</i>

28:23.240 --> 28:25.280
<i>-What a day!</i>
<i>-[Geljen] What a day, yeah.</i>

28:25.360 --> 28:27.760
<i>[pensive music playing]</i>

<i>[Nims]</i> After serving six years
with the Gurkhas,

<i>[Suchi] </i>That was the first time
I saw him working towards his goal.

<i>And how crazy he is.</i>

29:00.920 --> 29:02.760
<i>[alarm beeping]</i>

29:03.520 --> 29:06.840
<i>He used to wake up</i>
<i>2:00 or 3:00 in the morning,</i>

<i>run for 20 kilometers,</i>

29:11.800 --> 29:14.080
<i>carrying 75 pounds on his back.</i>

29:16.800 --> 29:20.560
<i>Work all day,</i>
<i>and then he would be off to the gym.</i>

29:22.680 --> 29:24.200
<i>He wouldn't be back until 11:00.</i>

29:26.760 --> 29:28.760
<i>That's how it was for six months.</i>

29:36.440 --> 29:39.520
<i>[Nims]</i> I became
the first Gurkha in history

29:39.600 --> 29:42.520
<i>to be selected</i>
<i>for the Special Boat Service.</i>

29:46.640 --> 29:51.800
<i>Being in the Special Forces</i>
<i>representing Nepal, wow!</i>

<i>1,000, 2,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, 8,000!</i>

30:01.680 --> 30:02.760
<i>Come on.</i>

30:04.640 --> 30:08.600
<i>I learned quickly,</i>
<i>whatever the situation is,</i>

30:08.680 --> 30:10.160
<i>you have to stay in control.</i>

30:11.200 --> 30:12.840
<i>I'm going to have to cut away.</i>

30:25.200 --> 30:31.000
<i>The whole experience gave me confidence</i>
<i>to take on massive challenges.</i>

30:31.080 --> 30:32.880
<i>[soft music playing]</i>

<i>[foreboding music playing]</i>

30:52.120 --> 30:53.600

<i>[slow dramatic music playing]</i>

<i>But luckily, the bullet hit</i>
<i>the extender of my weapon.</i>

31:31.480 --> 31:32.840
<i>And the gun saved my life.</i>

31:35.200 --> 31:37.800
<i>A couple of centimeters either way,</i>

31:38.800 --> 31:41.440
<i>that's the difference</i>
<i>between life and death.</i>

31:48.000 --> 31:52.080
<i>[Suchi] </i>My friends ask,

<i>then it's not going to do any good to me."</i>

32:16.640 --> 32:17.920
<i>I would break down.</i>

<i>You have to be strong.</i>

<i>I've never wanted to deviate him</i>
<i>from his dream or his goals.</i>

32:34.400 --> 32:37.440
<i>He knew what he wanted to do in life.</i>

<i>People today, if you ask them,</i>
<i>"Why you go to the high peaks?"</i>

33:00.080 --> 33:04.680
<i>They say, "Because it's fun."</i>
<i>I don't believe them. It's not fun.</i>

33:09.680 --> 33:16.640
<i>It's a place where you have to learn</i>
<i>to cope with pain because it's painful.</i>

<i>[soft music playing]</i>

33:30.800 --> 33:33.080
<i>[Nims] Eight o'clock in the morning,</i>

<i>Camp 2, sleep over there.</i>

<i>Camp 3, Camp 4, and then to the summit.</i>

34:16.440 --> 34:20.280
<i>Because of the weather window,</i>
<i>we had to climb in one day.</i>

<i>[Chin] </i>For Nims to climb Kanchenjunga

<i>[laughing] I mean…</i>

<i>I don't know what to think of that.</i>

<i>[Nims] Now, we are here at Camp 2.</i>

34:49.000 --> 34:51.120
<i>The plan is to go</i>
<i>and hit the summit directly.</i>

<i>So we won't be sleeping.</i>

34:58.960 --> 35:03.200
<i>[Chin] </i>Expeditions to 8,000-meter peaks

<i>Once you get above 8,000 meters,</i>

<i>You're breathing about</i>
<i>a third of the amount of oxygen</i>

<i>you're normally breathing at sea level.</i>

35:28.360 --> 35:31.600

<i>of climbing with oxygen is,</i>

<i>you become dependent on it.</i>

36:44.480 --> 36:47.400
<i>One hundred meters below the summit,</i>

<i>we found another climber</i>
<i>completely messed up.</i>

36:54.560 --> 36:56.760
<i>He had run out of oxygen.</i>

<i>[Nims] Be strong. We'll go home.</i>

<i>[Mingma in Nepali]</i>
<i>We need to get to Camp 4 now.</i>

<i>[Nims in English] Go, go. Go.</i>

37:08.440 --> 37:11.160
<i>When you come off</i>
<i>the oxygen at that altitude,</i>

37:11.840 --> 37:13.960
<i>it is extremely dangerous.</i>

37:18.200 --> 37:21.440
<i>But without oxygen,</i>
<i>you'll never be able to survive this.</i>

<i>In the military,</i>
<i>I have never left anyone behind.</i>

37:29.480 --> 37:32.040
<i>I wasn't gonna do that on the mountains.</i>

37:34.560 --> 37:37.440
<i>So we gave the climber our oxygen.</i>

37:38.560 --> 37:41.400
<i>And we made the radio contact</i>
<i>on all the camps saying,</i>

<i>That's when I realized</i>

<i>how strong a climber I was.</i>

43:17.240 --> 43:20.800
<i>I just fell in love with</i>

<i>[Nims inhaling and exhaling]</i>

43:27.040 --> 43:29.240
<i>[Barber] </i>We're here today,

<i>to see how his body reacts</i>

<i>whilst also making decisions</i>
<i>quickly and accurately.</i>

43:47.640 --> 43:51.040

<i>who've only been able</i>
<i>to manage about 90 seconds</i>

<i>One… One more minute to go.</i>

44:06.800 --> 44:10.480
<i>[Nims] </i>Physically, I believe

<i>that he was able</i>
<i>to get through the three minutes.</i>

<i>His physiology means</i>
<i>he's got more oxygen available to him</i>

<i>for physical work by the muscles,</i>

<i>and also for decision-making</i>
<i>to use his brain.</i>

<i>We had a bitter row.</i>

52:56.120 --> 52:59.240

<i>That is wrong because he has a name.</i>

57:47.560 --> 57:50.680

<i>First you have Nanga Parbat,</i>

<i>which has claimed</i>

<i>[Nims] That's right, it's very dangerous.</i>

1:00:46.520 --> 1:00:50.440
<i>[in English] </i>I always say to myself,

<i>I have to grab this.</i>

1:02:10.480 --> 1:02:13.840

<i>I just went boom!</i>

<i>It was a horrible experience, mate.</i>

1:02:43.520 --> 1:02:45.880

<i>[upbeat music playing through headphones]</i>

1:03:23.520 --> 1:03:25.240
<i>[Chin] </i>In the world of mountaineering,

<i>[soft music playing]</i>

1:03:38.760 --> 1:03:42.840
<i>The absolute purists believes</i>
<i>that climbing 8,000-meter peaks</i>

<i>should be done full Alpine style,</i>

<i>which means no use of oxygen.</i>

1:03:50.640 --> 1:03:52.280
<i>It's a constant debate.</i>

1:03:55.720 --> 1:03:59.160
<i>Nims' team is climbing</i>
<i>in the hybrid style,</i>

1:03:59.240 --> 1:04:03.520

<i>above 8,000 meters.</i>

1:04:04.560 --> 1:04:06.560
<i>[breathing heavily]</i>

<i>They're often putting in</i>
<i>the fixed lines to the summit,</i>

<i>and they're carrying</i>
<i>all their own climbing equipment,</i>

1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:19.280
<i>so they're totally self-sufficient.</i>

1:04:24.040 --> 1:04:27.320
<i>[Nims] </i>People saying that
it's so easy to climb with oxygen.

1:04:28.200 --> 1:04:29.480
<i>That is bullshit.</i>

1:04:31.800 --> 1:04:34.840
<i>The other mountaineers</i>
<i>were basically waiting for us</i>

1:04:34.920 --> 1:04:37.920
<i>to fix the ropes for them,</i>
<i>and they could just follow.</i>

1:04:39.720 --> 1:04:41.480
<i>It is so much easier.</i>

1:08:06.760 --> 1:08:08.840
<i>-No problem. We are here now.</i>
<i>-[all laugh]</i>

1:08:08.920 --> 1:08:11.040
<i>Project Possible is here. Okay?</i>

1:08:13.600 --> 1:08:18.440
<i>When I arrived at the base camp,</i>
<i>those mountaineers were stressed out.</i>

1:08:18.520 --> 1:08:23.200
<i>-Yeah. So, as a friend… Okay?</i>
<i>-Oh! Here's the thing.</i>

1:08:23.280 --> 1:08:25.920
<i>[Nims] </i>So I started to do
a big wild party, mate.

1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:28.160
<i>-Cheers, brother!</i>
<i>-Ah, cheers!</i>

1:08:28.240 --> 1:08:29.680
<i>[climbers laughing]</i>

<i>[upbeat music playing]</i>

1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:40.560
<i>[Klára] </i>This is the thing
that distinguishes him and his team

1:08:40.640 --> 1:08:41.560
<i>from the others.</i>

1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:46.680
<i>He don't give a damn</i>
<i>what other people do or what they think.</i>

1:08:46.760 --> 1:08:49.720
<i>Tonight we drink, tomorrow we plan!</i>

1:08:49.800 --> 1:08:51.720
<i>-Cheers!</i>
<i>-[all cheering]</i>

1:08:51.800 --> 1:08:53.480
<i>[Klára] </i>You're going to make it happen.

1:08:53.560 --> 1:08:55.520
<i>[indistinct chatter and whooping]</i>

1:08:57.960 --> 1:08:59.960
<i>[cheering]</i>

1:09:00.720 --> 1:09:04.280
<i>-Guys, one life, yeah? We live it.</i>
<i>-[man] Yeah! Yeah!</i>

1:09:04.360 --> 1:09:06.240
<i>[whooping]</i>

1:09:14.680 --> 1:09:18.760
<i>Early morning tomorrow, we're going</i>
<i>to be heading towards Camp 2, then Camp 4.</i>

1:09:18.840 --> 1:09:22.760
<i>And our plan is to set up the fixing lines</i>
<i>by at least, you know, 1200 hours.</i>

1:09:22.840 --> 1:09:27.400
<i>The climbers who had tried to summit,</i>
<i>they didn't want to go back up.</i>

1:09:28.920 --> 1:09:31.360
<i>I can see fear in their eyes.</i>

1:09:32.240 --> 1:09:35.720
<i>The people are giving up</i>
<i>because three people were in an avalanche.</i>

1:09:35.800 --> 1:09:36.760
<i>[Nims] Yeah, I got that.</i>

1:09:36.840 --> 1:09:39.640
<i>And this condition</i>
<i>does not change in the last five days.</i>

1:09:39.720 --> 1:09:41.160
<i>[Nims] Well, we'll go and see.</i>

1:09:41.240 --> 1:09:43.960
<i>Nims, you're a great boy,</i>
<i>and this is lovely propaganda,</i>

1:09:44.040 --> 1:09:45.680
<i>but you don't change the mountain.</i>

1:09:45.760 --> 1:09:48.880
<i>Of course, I never said</i>
<i>that I'm gonna change the mountain.</i>

1:09:48.960 --> 1:09:52.120
<i>As a leader,</i>
<i>you've got to present yourself</i>

1:09:52.200 --> 1:09:54.680
<i>with so</i>, so<i> much confidence.</i>

1:09:55.520 --> 1:09:57.160
<i>I've been coming</i>
<i>from mountain to mountain,</i>

1:09:57.240 --> 1:09:59.680
<i>and sometimes you feel like you're fucked,</i>

1:10:00.320 --> 1:10:03.960
<i>but when you say you are actually fucked,</i>
<i>you are only like about 45% fucked.</i>

1:10:05.440 --> 1:10:07.880
<i>A lot of people have turned around, right?</i>

1:10:08.440 --> 1:10:10.200
<i>A lot of people have failed.</i>

1:10:10.280 --> 1:10:12.720
<i>We have to unite,</i>
<i>and we have to go together.</i>

1:10:18.400 --> 1:10:20.360
<i>[indistinct chatter]</i>

1:10:22.960 --> 1:10:26.320
<i>[Klára] </i>There was this friend of mine,
very experienced mountaineer,

1:10:27.480 --> 1:10:31.560
<i>saying, "Klára,</i>
<i>it's 50% chance we make it,</i>

1:10:31.640 --> 1:10:33.720
<i>and it's 50% chance we die."</i>

1:10:34.520 --> 1:10:38.320
<i>And hearing that as a woman</i>
<i>and as a mother of two children,</i>

1:10:40.200 --> 1:10:42.840
<i>I'm thinking,</i>
<i>"What the hell am I doing here?"</i>

1:10:44.680 --> 1:10:46.200
<i>[speaking indistinctly]</i>

1:10:47.120 --> 1:10:50.720
<i>But then Nims said,</i>
<i>"Don't listen to the others."</i>

1:10:51.640 --> 1:10:55.400
<i>"You need to take chances,</i>
<i>and you need to take the risk sometimes</i>

1:10:55.480 --> 1:10:57.680
<i>in order to make things happen</i>
<i>for yourself."</i>

1:11:00.720 --> 1:11:03.200
<i>That was the moment</i>
<i>when I realized, "Damn it."</i>

1:11:05.760 --> 1:11:08.000
<i>"I will blame myself</i>
<i>for the rest of my life</i>

1:11:08.080 --> 1:11:09.960
<i>if I don't give it one more try."</i>

1:11:10.040 --> 1:11:12.040
<i>[indistinct chatter]</i>

1:11:18.440 --> 1:11:20.560
<i>[Madison] </i>Above Camp 4 on K2,

1:11:20.640 --> 1:11:24.240
<i>there's the Bottleneck section</i>
<i>which is considered the crux of the route.</i>

1:11:26.960 --> 1:11:31.120
<i>There's a giant overhanging ice cliff</i>
<i>just above it called the serac.</i>

1:11:31.680 --> 1:11:33.760
<i>[soft music playing]</i>

1:11:33.840 --> 1:11:38.240
<i>This wall of hanging ice</i>
<i>sometimes releases and sweeps</i>

<i>all the way down to base camp.</i>

1:11:41.600 --> 1:11:43.720
<i>You could have your whole team swept away.</i>

1:11:47.920 --> 1:11:51.680
<i>We thought there's no chance</i>
<i>anyone will summit K2 this season,</i>

1:11:51.760 --> 1:11:55.800
<i>but Nims had</i>
<i>so much riding on this project,</i>

1:11:56.600 --> 1:11:59.040
<i>he was ready</i>
<i>to go up there and risk his life</i>

1:12:00.240 --> 1:12:02.000
<i>and give it his best shot.</i>

1:12:12.560 --> 1:12:17.480
<i>[Nims] </i>A lot of people
had tried to set the fixed lines

1:12:17.560 --> 1:12:19.840
<i>just around the Bottleneck</i>
<i>in the daylight,</i>

1:12:20.560 --> 1:12:22.680
<i>but that's an avalanche prone area.</i>

1:12:25.360 --> 1:12:27.600
<i>My plan is to be on that part</i>

1:12:27.680 --> 1:12:31.320
<i>where everybody had given up</i>
<i>exactly at one o'clock at night.</i>

1:12:32.600 --> 1:12:35.800
<i>The snow will be like concrete.</i>

<i>[soft pensive music playing]</i>

1:12:45.320 --> 1:12:48.400
<i>This was the first time</i>

<i>because everyone had given up.</i>

1:12:56.000 --> 1:13:00.400
<i>But the biggest strength</i>
<i>I have is, I have no fear.</i>

1:13:04.680 --> 1:13:05.960
<i>I'm gonna go up there</i>

1:13:07.360 --> 1:13:08.840
<i>and make my own assessment.</i>

1:13:12.840 --> 1:13:13.800
<i>Today Camp 2.</i>

<i>[Kamal] </i>The doctor said
she can go at any time.

<i>It would be wise for you</i>
<i>to call all your family here.</i>

1:19:22.960 --> 1:19:27.360
<i>[in Nepali] Our options are</i>

<i>From what I understand, Mum's chances</i>
<i>of being revived are completely zero.</i>

1:19:43.080 --> 1:19:46.560
<i>[Suchi] </i>Eventually, the doctor said
we can't operate on her

<i>because she is so vulnerable.</i>

1:19:51.120 --> 1:19:53.200
<i>Nims is so close to his mum.</i>

<i>I just felt like I'm doing</i>
<i>this inspiring, positive endeavor.</i>

1:20:13.680 --> 1:20:16.400
<i>But as a son, I felt I had failed.</i>

1:20:21.720 --> 1:20:24.880
<i>I just said,</i>
<i>"Don't lose your heart," you know?</i>

1:20:26.920 --> 1:20:28.480
<i>"She is proud of you."</i>

<i>[laughing and whooping]</i>

1:22:04.240 --> 1:22:08.960
<i>[Suchi] </i>The plan for Phase 3

1:22:16.600 --> 1:22:19.400

<i>Problem two,</i>
<i>I was in the base camp of Manaslu,</i>

1:23:05.240 --> 1:23:07.760
<i>but Cho Oyu will be closed next week.</i>

1:23:08.560 --> 1:23:10.200
<i>I had to move fast.</i>

<i>We're heading back to catch our flight,</i>

<i>so that we can enter Tibet</i>
<i>by tomorrow evening.</i>

1:23:25.200 --> 1:23:28.160
<i>[Suchi] </i>Most people
normally plan for one expedition,

1:23:29.200 --> 1:23:31.080
<i>but here we're planning for 14.</i>

1:23:32.520 --> 1:23:34.880
<i>The logistics were very stressful.</i>

1:23:35.360 --> 1:23:38.160
<i>[Nims] The vehicle can't go</i>
<i>any further than this.</i>

1:23:38.240 --> 1:23:40.440
<i>[dramatic music continues]</i>

1:23:42.200 --> 1:23:45.160
<i>The deadline is running out of our hands,</i>

1:23:45.240 --> 1:23:49.000
<i>and I could see</i>
<i>how much pressure he's going through.</i>

1:23:51.040 --> 1:23:52.280
<i>[horn honking]</i>

1:23:55.160 --> 1:23:57.160
<i>[music continues]</i>

1:24:00.400 --> 1:24:05.320
<i>So, we are</i>
<i>at the Cho Oyu base camp. [exhales]</i>

1:24:07.800 --> 1:24:09.800
<i>[Suchi]</i> We were all worried about him.

1:24:29.040 --> 1:24:34.680
<i>Yeah, it's an absolute pleasure</i>
<i>to be here on the summit of Cho Oyu.</i>

1:24:34.760 --> 1:24:39.440
<i>And, uh, in few days' time,</i>
<i>I'll give you the summit of Manaslu.</i>

1:24:40.200 --> 1:24:41.320
<i>Whoo!</i>

1:24:44.720 --> 1:24:46.000
<i>[dramatic music playing]</i>

1:25:00.160 --> 1:25:03.040
<i>[Suchi] </i>For Nims as well,
behind the scenes,

1:25:03.120 --> 1:25:05.240
<i>his mum was on his mind.</i>

1:25:07.040 --> 1:25:08.680
<i>It was a constant worry for him.</i>

1:25:17.400 --> 1:25:21.080
<i>[Nims] </i>Standing on top of Manaslu,
I was obviously happy.

1:25:22.480 --> 1:25:24.040
<i>But inside my chest…</i>

1:25:27.520 --> 1:25:30.720
<i>I was feeling that</i>
<i>it could be my last mountain.</i>

1:25:47.840 --> 1:25:51.560
<i>[Chin] </i>The one thing at this point
that could stop Nims from finishing…

1:25:51.640 --> 1:25:54.840
<i>was access to</i>
<i>the final mountain, Shishapangma.</i>

1:25:59.120 --> 1:26:01.160
<i>To any normal person,</i>

1:26:02.120 --> 1:26:04.960
<i>the Chinese government</i>
<i>giving you a hard no</i>

1:26:05.560 --> 1:26:10.040
<i>would be a moment to, you know, walk away.</i>

1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:15.800
<i>[in Nepali] They have said no climbers</i>
<i>are allowed on Shishapangma.</i>

1:26:16.600 --> 1:26:19.240
<i>But if it goes through</i>
<i>a Nepali government official,</i>

1:26:19.320 --> 1:26:20.440
<i>they may allow it.</i>

1:26:24.480 --> 1:26:27.760
<i>[Suchi] </i>Nims was non-stop
meeting politicians.

1:26:27.840 --> 1:26:32.920
<i>What can we do for humanity?</i>
<i>To prove that power of possibility.</i>

1:26:33.960 --> 1:26:35.640
<i>The former prime minister.</i>

1:26:35.720 --> 1:26:41.640
<i>Sir, as a Nepali, I thought</i>
<i>of this project as this country's project.</i>

1:26:42.440 --> 1:26:44.720
<i>But this could take four,</i>
<i>five, six months.</i>

1:26:44.800 --> 1:26:46.960
<i>[Nims in English] This is for everyone</i>
<i>here in this room.</i>

1:26:47.040 --> 1:26:48.480
<i>Everyone who is in Nepal.</i>

1:26:51.400 --> 1:26:53.920
<i>I'm no one compared to the power of China.</i>

1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:55.200
<i>[camera clicking]</i>

1:26:57.720 --> 1:27:00.360
<i>But I was never gonna get fazed by that.</i>

1:27:07.360 --> 1:27:08.560
<i>I took two routes.</i>

1:27:09.760 --> 1:27:12.200
<i>One, the political process.</i>

1:27:13.960 --> 1:27:15.240
<i>The second was…</i>

1:27:17.760 --> 1:27:19.920
<i>I asked my followers for help.</i>

1:27:31.160 --> 1:27:33.960
<i>[Suchi] </i>Many wrote
to the Chinese government.

1:27:34.040 --> 1:27:36.160
<i>[dramatic music continues]</i>

1:27:40.480 --> 1:27:42.040
<i>From all over the world.</i>

1:28:02.400 --> 1:28:06.320
<i>[Nims] </i>I also started to get support
from the mountaineering community.

1:28:08.200 --> 1:28:12.120
<i>-Yeah! Hey, Nims. Conrad.</i>
<i>-Jimmy. [laughs]</i>

1:28:12.200 --> 1:28:14.440
<i>Shout-out to you, man.</i>
<i>You've got Shishapangma.</i>

1:28:14.520 --> 1:28:16.160
<i>You're the man. Crush it.</i>

1:28:16.240 --> 1:28:19.240
<i>It is a project not only for himself,</i>

1:28:19.320 --> 1:28:22.680
<i>but for Nepal,</i>
<i>for the Sherpas, for mountaineering.</i>

1:28:28.400 --> 1:28:31.840
<i>[Suchi] </i>The Chinese government
saw the whole world is supporting him.

1:28:35.640 --> 1:28:38.120
<i>[Nims] </i>Finally, the news came through that

1:28:38.200 --> 1:28:41.680
<i>the Chinese were opening</i>
<i>the mountain for me and my team.</i>

1:28:44.080 --> 1:28:45.680
<i>One mountain to go.</i>

1:28:46.960 --> 1:28:48.200
<i>Let's do this.</i>

1:28:58.480 --> 1:28:59.800
<i>[soft music playing]</i>

1:29:01.840 --> 1:29:04.520

<i>[crows cawing]</i>

1:29:06.160 --> 1:29:07.960
<i>This is my last mountain.</i>

1:29:11.720 --> 1:29:13.080
<i>Let's take it slow.</i>

1:29:15.200 --> 1:29:16.960
<i>Let's make it really easy.</i>

1:29:22.400 --> 1:29:24.200
<i>That was the plan. </i>[chuckles]

1:29:25.360 --> 1:29:26.800
<i>[wind gusting]</i>

1:29:30.360 --> 1:29:31.200
<i>[screams]</i>

1:29:32.480 --> 1:29:34.040
<i>[in Nepali] What's up with this weather?</i>

1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:40.800
<i>Gesman. Gesman, brother.</i>

1:29:40.880 --> 1:29:42.840
<i>We need to tie the ropes.</i>

1:29:49.320 --> 1:29:50.880
<i>[in English] </i>It was horrendous.

1:29:55.120 --> 1:29:57.280
<i>[in Nepali] </i>We were really worried.

1:29:59.640 --> 1:30:03.600
<i>No one had climbed</i>
<i>Shishapangma since 2014.</i>

1:30:05.640 --> 1:30:07.640
<i>[rumbling]</i>

1:30:10.400 --> 1:30:12.040
<i>[Nims in English] It's an avalanche.</i>

1:30:15.640 --> 1:30:19.200
<i>[in Nepali] </i>Who is my team?
Can we do this?

1:30:20.040 --> 1:30:23.040
<i>These are the questions you ask yourself</i>
<i>in this kind of situation.</i>

1:30:31.400 --> 1:30:34.720
<i>But the project had become our dream,</i>

1:30:34.800 --> 1:30:37.160
<i>and we were focused</i>
<i>on making it come true.</i>

1:30:43.360 --> 1:30:46.440
<i>[dramatic music playing]</i>

1:30:53.560 --> 1:30:57.680
<i>[Nims in English] </i>In life,
you have to keep doing what you believe.

1:31:04.520 --> 1:31:09.120
<i>You have to ask yourself,</i>
<i>do you really want this from your heart?</i>

1:31:17.000 --> 1:31:18.560
<i>Is it for the self-glory?</i>

1:31:20.600 --> 1:31:22.680
<i>Or is it for something bigger?</i>

1:31:28.840 --> 1:31:31.280
<i>Sometimes, the idea that you come up with</i>

1:31:31.360 --> 1:31:33.440
<i>may seem impossible</i>
<i>to the rest of the world,</i>

1:31:34.720 --> 1:31:36.960
<i>but that doesn't mean</i>
<i>it's impossible to you.</i>

1:31:37.800 --> 1:31:39.600
<i>[music increases in tempo]</i>

1:31:46.920 --> 1:31:51.400
<i>And if you can inspire</i>
<i>one or two people in a good way,</i>

1:31:53.000 --> 1:31:55.080
<i>then you can inspire the world.</i>

1:31:56.440 --> 1:31:59.040
<i>[music intensifies]</i>

<i>Whoo!</i>

1:32:22.360 --> 1:32:25.440
<i>When I was on the summit,</i>
<i>I got on the radio.</i>

<i>[in Nepali] Mum…</i>

1:32:31.560 --> 1:32:35.120
<i>[in English]</i> I said, "Mum, you know
that project I was talking about?"

1:32:37.080 --> 1:32:38.360
<i>"That is over."</i>

1:32:42.240 --> 1:32:43.200
<i>We did it.</i>

<i>[indistinct chatter and laughter]</i>

<i>[Kamal] </i>Mum obviously was very ill.

<i>But she's a very stubborn lady.</i>

1:33:31.240 --> 1:33:36.840
<i>She hang on, she fight, she fight,</i>
<i>she fight until her youngest son succeeds.</i>

<i>[mellow music playing]</i>

1:33:47.560 --> 1:33:50.480
<i>[Nims] </i>For her to be part

<i>and to be able to celebrate that together,</i>

<i>nothing can beat that, bro.</i>

<i>[Suchi] </i>I always knew he doesn't give up.

<i>I had so many gray hairs because of</i>

<i>if this was done by</i>
