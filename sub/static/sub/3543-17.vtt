on "The Vampire Diaries"...

00:01.904 --> 00:05.800
He's dead. No, no!
I can't, I can't!

00:05.801 --> 00:07.136
Turn it off.

00:07.137 --> 00:10.157
Stefan: Her humanity, Damon.
That was all she had left.

00:10.158 --> 00:13.910
Humanity means nothing when you don't
have anyone to care about, Stefan.

00:13.911 --> 00:15.328
I know how to bring Jeremy back.

00:15.329 --> 00:17.096
It's called an expression triangle.

00:17.097 --> 00:18.749
I need to complete it for Silas.

00:18.750 --> 00:21.047
The nutty professor's
got her totally brainwashed.

00:21.048 --> 00:23.648
- You had 36 people killed?
- No. I had 24 people killed...

00:23.649 --> 00:25.172
12 humans at the Young farm,
12 hybrids.

00:25.173 --> 00:27.057
You and I are gonna
complete the triangle.

00:27.058 --> 00:28.729
I was looking for answers,

00:28.730 --> 00:31.311
and all I found was
your Professor Shane dead.

00:31.312 --> 00:33.396
I think Silas followed us
back from that island.

00:33.397 --> 00:35.065
You and I, we are the beginning.

00:35.066 --> 00:36.599
The cure. I know someone has it.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.518
- Katherine.
- The doppelganger?

00:38.519 --> 00:39.931
Where are you right now?

00:39.932 --> 00:41.535
In the boonies looking
for a dead vampire

00:41.536 --> 00:43.323
that might lead to
Katherine and the cure.

00:43.324 --> 00:45.075
- Damon?
- Will?

00:45.076 --> 00:46.326
Hey, buddy.

00:46.327 --> 00:48.612
Everyone needs to
just stop telling me

00:48.613 --> 00:49.999
that I need to feel.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.415
Be honest.
You like me better like this.

00:52.416 --> 00:53.450
So where are we going?

00:53.451 --> 00:54.818
A place every newbie vampire

00:54.819 --> 00:55.952
should go at least
once in their life.

00:55.953 --> 00:57.286
New York.

01:04.343 --> 01:07.130
- Girl: You were right.
- Told you.

01:07.131 --> 01:09.382
- That was really good.
- Yeah?

01:09.383 --> 01:12.768
- Glad you liked it.
- Yeah. Thanks for inviting me.

01:12.769 --> 01:16.004
- Do it again next weekend?
- If you're lucky.

01:18.391 --> 01:23.814
Oh, God. Is he...
do you think he's dead?

01:23.815 --> 01:25.180
I don't know.

01:32.345 --> 01:33.623
Stay there.

01:37.263 --> 01:38.410
Aah!

01:38.913 --> 01:40.412
Oh, my God!

02:01.484 --> 02:05.438

Elena: You dragged me
all the way to New York

02:42.408 --> 02:45.195
- because you were feeling nostalgic?
- No. I dragged you to New York

02:45.196 --> 02:46.696
because in a matter of 3 days

02:46.697 --> 02:48.431
you managed to piss off
everyone in Mystic Falls.

02:48.432 --> 02:50.514
A little more difficult to
do in a city of millions.

02:50.515 --> 02:52.736
- I was hungry.
- You were reckless.

02:52.737 --> 02:54.604
Emotionless.
There's a difference.

02:54.605 --> 02:55.956
Look. All that matters
is that when I lived here

02:55.957 --> 02:57.791
I fed like crazy and had a blast

02:57.792 --> 03:00.855
and went undetected for years.

03:00.856 --> 03:04.781
So we're just here to have fun?

03:04.782 --> 03:07.217
- What's the catch?
- There's no catch.

03:07.218 --> 03:08.668
Look. You wanted out.
I got you out.

03:08.669 --> 03:10.220
You wanted to feed,
I brought you to a city-sized

03:10.221 --> 03:12.172
all-you-can-eat buffet.

03:12.173 --> 03:14.839
That's the beauty of New York.
There's so much life

03:15.435 --> 03:17.255
that a little death goes unnoticed.

03:19.680 --> 03:21.847
Come on. Let's go get some lunch.

03:30.740 --> 03:33.159
Wait. What do you mean
you took her to New York?

03:33.160 --> 03:34.694
And that tone is the reason
I didn't pick up the phone

03:34.695 --> 03:37.030
the first 20 times you called.

03:37.031 --> 03:38.531
Where is she now?

03:38.532 --> 03:40.867
Out exploring.
Maybe she's eating a hot dog...

03:40.868 --> 03:42.170
Vendor.

03:42.171 --> 03:45.337
So I take it your search
for Katherine is off.

03:45.338 --> 03:47.257
Relax, man.
This little joy ride

03:47.258 --> 03:48.657
is actually a cure hunt.

03:50.680 --> 03:52.996
That vampire that Katherine sent
after Hayley is a friend of mine.

03:52.997 --> 03:54.180
He lived in the city.

03:54.181 --> 03:56.332
Will gets vampires fake identities,

03:56.333 --> 03:58.601
and I'm sure that Katherine's
one of his clients.

03:58.602 --> 04:01.108
And Elena's ok with
this little field trip?

04:01.109 --> 04:02.889
Just yesterday, she was
living the vampire high life.

04:02.890 --> 04:04.307
She doesn't want the cure.

04:04.308 --> 04:05.970
That's why I didn't tell her.

04:05.971 --> 04:07.644
Damon, if she finds out
you're still looking for it,

04:07.645 --> 04:09.012
she'll bolt.

04:09.013 --> 04:10.437
I'm aware of that, Stefan.

04:10.438 --> 04:12.449
What I'm hoping is
she's gonna be so wasted

04:12.450 --> 04:14.620
on booze and blood
that she won't even think about it.

04:14.621 --> 04:16.077
Don't underestimate her.

04:16.079 --> 04:17.291
If I can handle you when
you flip your switch,

04:17.293 --> 04:18.786
I can handle her.
Trust me.

04:18.788 --> 04:20.824
Listen to me. She's ruthless
without her humanity.

04:20.825 --> 04:22.959
The cure's the fastest
way to get it back.

04:22.960 --> 04:24.861
Just be a good brother
and keep Mystic Falls afloat for me

04:24.862 --> 04:26.829
and let me do my thing.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.132
You've got an immortal named
Silas to deal with, remember?

04:51.654 --> 04:54.077
Desperate times I take it.

04:54.996 --> 04:58.652
- What are you doing here?
- Not judging you for starters,

04:58.653 --> 05:01.029
although if you are
determined to get drunk,

05:01.030 --> 05:04.074
then perhaps I might recommend
something a little more sanitary.

05:08.421 --> 05:11.147
Well, then.
You showed me.

05:11.148 --> 05:13.676
Shouldn't you be out chasing Tyler
to the ends of the earth,

05:13.677 --> 05:16.513
or are there some hopes and dreams
you want to crush around here?

05:16.514 --> 05:19.700
Depends. Do you happen to know
where the young Brutus is?

05:19.701 --> 05:22.092
I know where he's not... with me.

05:22.520 --> 05:24.304
He gave Matt the deed
to the house,

05:24.305 --> 05:27.089
so he's gone for good.

05:29.871 --> 05:33.701
Tyler made it his life's
mission to kill me.

05:35.399 --> 05:37.784
You can't hate me
for driving him away.

05:37.785 --> 05:40.787
No. I can, and I do.

05:40.788 --> 05:42.906
Now if you don't mind,
I'd like to get back to spiraling,

05:42.907 --> 05:44.554
so go away.

05:45.849 --> 05:50.163
Stefan: Actually,
I asked him to be here.

05:50.164 --> 05:53.549
We need his help.
I think Silas is in Mystic Falls.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.586
Ok. Come on.
Take a deep breath.

05:56.587 --> 05:57.887
[Inhales]

05:57.888 --> 05:59.472
And 5, 4...

05:59.473 --> 06:01.030
I can't do this.

06:01.031 --> 06:04.335
Bonnie, relax, ok?
Trust me.

06:04.336 --> 06:06.912
How can I trust you if you
won't show me your real face?

06:06.913 --> 06:08.131
Don't you think
it's a little creepy

06:08.132 --> 06:09.849
that you're appearing
as my dead professor?

06:09.850 --> 06:11.317
I told you that I'm Silas,

06:11.318 --> 06:12.936
I told you Shane
died on the island.

06:12.937 --> 06:15.470
I'm trying to earn your trust.

06:17.690 --> 06:20.643
All right. Look.

06:20.644 --> 06:24.587
You invited me into your home,
right?

06:24.588 --> 06:26.416
Why?

06:26.417 --> 06:28.881
Why'd you lie to your friends
and tell them everything was fine?

06:28.882 --> 06:30.787
Why did you convince
your dad that you needed

06:30.788 --> 06:32.789
Professor Shane's help
to control your magic?

06:32.790 --> 06:35.374
- What am I doing here?
- You're in my head.

06:35.375 --> 06:36.709
You're making me
see things and do things.

06:36.710 --> 06:39.345
Hey. Now. See?
Look. I'm strong,

06:39.346 --> 06:41.381
but you're a witch,

06:41.382 --> 06:43.099
and I can't force
you to do anything

06:43.100 --> 06:45.871
that you don't already want to do.

06:47.098 --> 06:48.846
You care about Jeremy, right?

06:49.840 --> 06:51.057
I do.

06:51.058 --> 06:53.693
Yeah. You were with him,

06:53.694 --> 06:56.846
and you promised to protect him,

06:56.847 --> 06:58.348
but you failed,

07:00.294 --> 07:02.442
and now in order
to bring him back...

07:02.903 --> 07:05.860
I need to get rid
of the other side.

07:05.861 --> 07:07.906
You are descended from Qetsiyah,

07:07.907 --> 07:09.876
one of the most
powerful witches of all time.

07:09.877 --> 07:12.745
Only you can complete the triangle

07:12.746 --> 07:14.380
and cast the spell.

07:14.381 --> 07:16.382
Completing the triangle
means killing 12 people.

07:16.383 --> 07:19.515
12 people you can bring back.

07:21.065 --> 07:25.058
Bonnie, you can do
this for Jeremy.

07:25.059 --> 07:27.677
So some blood went missing
from a few hospitals.

07:27.678 --> 07:29.378
What about Elena?

07:29.379 --> 07:31.358
Don't vampires
with their humanity off

07:31.359 --> 07:33.348
tend to overindulge in human blood,

07:33.870 --> 07:37.245
- or were you the exception?
- It's not Elena.

07:37.246 --> 07:38.861
Well, let's say for
a moment that it was Silas.

07:38.862 --> 07:41.732
I'm struggling to see
how this affects me.

07:41.733 --> 07:44.077
Look. Silas wants to die
and be reunited

07:44.078 --> 07:46.446
with his one true love,
but he's supernatural,

07:46.447 --> 07:47.947
so if he takes the cure and dies,

07:47.948 --> 07:49.239
he gets stuck on the other side.

07:49.240 --> 07:50.617
How Shakespearian.

07:50.618 --> 07:52.585
But if he destroys
the other side altogether,

07:52.586 --> 07:55.071
he can take the cure,
die, and pass on,

07:55.072 --> 07:56.206
but in destroying it,

07:56.207 --> 07:58.291
every dead supernatural being

07:58.292 --> 08:00.009
will return to our side.

08:00.010 --> 08:02.192
That means every werewolf,
every witch,

08:02.193 --> 08:03.242
every vampire.

08:03.243 --> 08:05.081
I wonder how many of those
you personally killed.

08:05.082 --> 08:06.365
Care yet?

08:06.366 --> 08:08.851
My interest is piqued.

08:08.852 --> 08:10.770
How do we stop him?

08:10.771 --> 08:14.440
Bonnie said Silas needs to complete
3 massacres to do this spell.

08:14.441 --> 08:16.759
Before Professor Shane died,
he convinced the pastor

08:16.760 --> 08:18.061
to blow up the council.

08:18.062 --> 08:19.812
Next, he had you kill your hybrids,

08:19.813 --> 08:22.932
and now he only needs
one more massacre,

08:22.933 --> 08:25.934
so if he's here,
that's what he's doing.

08:25.935 --> 08:28.278
We need to find him.

08:28.279 --> 08:30.438

08:39.549 --> 08:42.049

a hot new haircut today.

with more punked-out nihilists

08:52.146 --> 08:54.063
than you can eat
in a decade, trust me.

08:54.064 --> 08:55.598
How do you know?

08:55.599 --> 08:57.800
Because I spent most
of the seventies here.

08:57.801 --> 08:59.302
The factory was too clean,

08:59.303 --> 09:00.727
CBGB's was too high-profile,

09:00.728 --> 09:03.740
but Billy's...

I've gotten from you, Billy boy.

Is that the same client?

09:25.963 --> 09:27.430
She's a runner.

identities than others.

- You're gonna feed on him right here?

I have to say I'm

I thought we made a good team.

are you talking about?

a lead to the cure.

to be wrong all the time?

10:46.206 --> 10:48.090
Right. So you drove
7 hours to New York City?

10:48.091 --> 10:50.543
Yes, and as I was
explaining to Elena

10:50.544 --> 10:52.211
before we were
so rudely interrupted,

10:52.212 --> 10:54.013
that my history in this city has

10:54.014 --> 10:57.917
a particular resonance
to her current situation.

10:57.918 --> 10:59.721
When I had my humanity off.

10:59.722 --> 11:01.640
Lexi: That explains it.

11:01.641 --> 11:03.808
- Your switch is flipped.
- Ugh. Would you mind?

11:03.809 --> 11:06.105
I can't even hear my prey
over your constant babbling.

11:06.106 --> 11:08.394
You're not even
covering your tracks.

11:08.395 --> 11:11.113
We heard about you back
in Mystic Falls.

11:11.114 --> 11:13.115
So Stefan sent you.

11:13.116 --> 11:14.903
Hmm. I thought we
were on the off part

11:14.904 --> 11:17.286
of our endless on-again, off-again,

11:17.287 --> 11:18.904
eternity-of-misery cycle.

11:18.905 --> 11:21.356
Lucky for you he cared
just enough to send me.

11:21.357 --> 11:22.825
So why'd you flip it?

11:22.826 --> 11:24.326
What traumatic event was too much

11:24.327 --> 11:26.373
for Damon Salvatore to handle?

11:26.830 --> 11:28.625
"Leave it to beaver."
The fifties bored me.

11:28.626 --> 11:30.416
Well, it's the seventies now,

11:30.417 --> 11:33.035
and keeping it off is gonna
get you caught and killed.

11:33.036 --> 11:34.086
And I'll chance it.

11:34.087 --> 11:36.038
I won't.
I promised Stefan...

11:36.039 --> 11:38.557
Look,
you and Stefan have a thing.

11:38.558 --> 11:40.342
He falls off the wagon,
you pick him up.

11:40.343 --> 11:41.760
He's redeemed, you get your

11:41.761 --> 11:42.809
Florence nightingale jollies, ok?

11:42.810 --> 11:44.683
But that's not me.
I'm not him.

11:44.684 --> 11:46.852
I don't want or need you.

11:46.853 --> 11:50.819
Too bad because you got me.

11:50.820 --> 11:52.691
Rebekah: Wow.
She sounds dreadful.

11:53.123 --> 11:54.651
She had a mother Teresa complex.

11:54.652 --> 11:55.902
So let me guess.

11:55.903 --> 11:58.277
After many dark nights with Lexi,

11:58.278 --> 12:00.496
she convinced you to turn
your emotions back on,

12:00.497 --> 12:04.199
and that's exactly what you
plan to do with me. Hmm.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.868
You read the last page
of a book first, too?

12:08.203 --> 12:10.838
I'm gonna get a drink, many drinks.

12:17.546 --> 12:18.964
So you really buy all this?

12:18.965 --> 12:22.084
Not one bit.

12:22.085 --> 12:23.919
I know he's after the cure.

12:23.920 --> 12:25.587
I'm not stupid.

12:25.588 --> 12:28.891
Well, let's not say
things we don't mean.

12:28.892 --> 12:30.645
Damon is like a dog with a bone.

12:30.646 --> 12:32.778
Stefan, too.

12:32.779 --> 12:33.896
They won't give up
until they find the cure

12:33.897 --> 12:37.099
and then make me take it.

12:37.100 --> 12:40.202
So I guess I'm gonna
have to find it first.

12:40.203 --> 12:41.820
You're playing him.

12:41.821 --> 12:43.438
No. He's playing me.

12:43.439 --> 12:45.373
I'm just returning the favor.

12:51.714 --> 12:54.116
What are we even looking for?

12:54.117 --> 12:58.053
Well, if Shane really
was working with Silas,

12:58.054 --> 13:01.473
chances are he was helping
him plan his next move.

13:01.474 --> 13:04.810
Where, on his evil
villain to-do list...

13:04.811 --> 13:07.303
steal blood,
perform 3 massacres,

13:07.304 --> 13:10.302
- pick up dry cleaning?
- Actually not to nit-pick,

13:10.303 --> 13:12.351
but we evil villains
usually use minions

13:12.352 --> 13:14.687
to pick up our dry cleaning,
that sort of thing.

13:14.688 --> 13:16.399
Why is he necessary again?

13:16.806 --> 13:18.157
Well, we don't know
what Silas can do,

13:18.158 --> 13:19.858
so if we do have to
go head to head with him,

13:19.859 --> 13:22.194
an original hybrid who can't die

13:22.195 --> 13:23.979
might come in handy.

13:23.980 --> 13:26.159
Besides,
Stefan and I work well together,

13:26.160 --> 13:28.334
or at least we did in the twenties.

13:28.335 --> 13:32.320
Well, granted my emotions were off.

13:32.321 --> 13:34.123
And that's why you were more fun

13:34.124 --> 13:36.002
just as Damon is probably relishing

13:36.459 --> 13:40.662
in Elena's emotionless
company in New York.

13:40.663 --> 13:42.630
My brother knows what he's doing.

13:42.631 --> 13:44.733
Does he?

13:44.734 --> 13:48.431
Don't underestimate
the allure of darkness, Stefan.

13:48.432 --> 13:51.773
Even the purest hearts
are drawn to it.

13:55.611 --> 13:59.231
Still, I'm sure
it will all be fine.

13:59.232 --> 14:02.618
I think I found something.

14:02.619 --> 14:05.922
"Symbolic figures
in the dark arts."

14:05.923 --> 14:08.156
Didn't Bonnie talk
about expression triangles?

14:08.639 --> 14:10.912
Here.

14:11.378 --> 14:14.162
"In some schools of magic
such as expression,

14:14.163 --> 14:17.833
"human sacrifice can be
used as a focus for power.

14:17.834 --> 14:20.552
"It's rumored that the addition
of two supernatural sacrifices

14:20.553 --> 14:23.105
"compounds the mystical energy,

14:23.106 --> 14:25.974
creating an expression triangle."

14:25.975 --> 14:30.045
Humans... that was
the council fire.

14:30.046 --> 14:33.715
Demons... Klaus' hybrid failure.

14:33.716 --> 14:34.883
Well, I wouldn't exactly
call it a failure.

14:34.884 --> 14:36.313
What's the third?

14:39.321 --> 14:40.572
Oh, no.

14:40.573 --> 14:42.207
You want me to kill witches?

14:42.208 --> 14:43.725
We've been over this.

14:43.726 --> 14:44.860
It's temporary.
They'll come back.

14:44.861 --> 14:47.304
- What if I'm not strong enough?
- You are strong enough.

14:47.305 --> 14:49.998
Look. It won't be easy.

14:49.999 --> 14:51.522
Once they realize
how strong you are,

14:51.523 --> 14:55.537
they'll channel each other
one by one using spirit magic

14:55.538 --> 14:59.044
till they can strip
you of expression.

14:59.509 --> 15:03.879
You have to endure them
until all 12 are linked as one.

15:03.880 --> 15:06.465
[Door opens and shuts]

15:06.466 --> 15:07.966
Listen. Your dad's here.

15:07.967 --> 15:09.901
We have to convince him.

15:13.388 --> 15:16.358
Hey. How was the session?

15:16.359 --> 15:19.895
To be honest,
not that great.

15:19.896 --> 15:21.396
The meditation
isn't really working.

15:21.397 --> 15:22.698
Here magic's too strong.

15:22.699 --> 15:24.525
You told me you could help her.

15:24.526 --> 15:26.101
Dad, it's...
it's not his fault.

15:26.102 --> 15:27.435
Not his fault? He's the one
who taught you this magic,

15:27.436 --> 15:28.704
and now he can't control it.

15:28.705 --> 15:30.239
Listen. We have an idea.

15:30.240 --> 15:31.457
I'm done listening to your ideas.

15:31.458 --> 15:32.958
- I want you to get out of my house.
- Dad!

15:32.959 --> 15:34.076
We just call on the spirits.

15:34.077 --> 15:36.828
- I want you out of my house!
- Wait!

15:40.082 --> 15:41.750
What the hell is happening to her?

15:41.751 --> 15:44.720
This happened to my wife.

15:44.721 --> 15:46.004
Expression consumed her.

15:46.005 --> 15:47.467
She had no control.

15:50.976 --> 15:53.679
I need you to call mom.

15:53.680 --> 15:58.249
We need witches,
a lot of them.

16:04.615 --> 16:06.783
[Playing music]

16:19.347 --> 16:20.715
Is this allowed?

16:20.716 --> 16:21.933
What would Lexi say?

16:21.934 --> 16:23.434
Lexi thought the only way I would

16:23.435 --> 16:25.219
turn my emotions back
on was if I started

16:25.220 --> 16:26.921
enjoying my life again.

16:26.922 --> 16:28.805
Do not tell me she took you
to Bon Jovi concerts, too.

16:28.806 --> 16:31.976
No. Wrong decade.

16:31.977 --> 16:34.362
Lexi was not allowed
to feed with Stefan.

16:34.363 --> 16:36.597
I didn't have that problem,

16:36.598 --> 16:38.435
and neither do you.

16:57.385 --> 16:58.952
Hey!

17:20.141 --> 17:23.477
I'm hungry.

17:23.478 --> 17:24.978
Pick.

17:34.822 --> 17:36.489
Don't scream.

18:10.291 --> 18:11.908
Your turn.

18:50.831 --> 18:52.866
Ugh. Packrat.

18:54.735 --> 18:56.019
Thanks, will.

19:06.547 --> 19:09.850
Is it just you?

19:09.851 --> 19:11.936
This place wasn't easy to find.

19:11.937 --> 19:14.257
Figured you wouldn't
want to draw attention.

19:14.690 --> 19:17.058
It will work.

19:17.059 --> 19:18.276
I'm Aja.

19:18.277 --> 19:20.695
You friends with my mom?

19:20.696 --> 19:22.247
I was.

19:22.248 --> 19:23.364
After she became a vampire,

19:23.365 --> 19:24.865
we didn't have
a whole lot in common.

19:24.866 --> 19:26.267
So she's not coming.

19:26.268 --> 19:28.151
This is witch business.

19:30.571 --> 19:32.667
Look. I know you're scared,

19:32.668 --> 19:35.309
but I've dealt
with expression before.

19:35.310 --> 19:37.745
I know the hold it can have on you.

19:37.746 --> 19:38.779
It's not that.

19:38.780 --> 19:43.251
I'm just...
I'm strong.

19:43.252 --> 19:45.413
You won't be able to do this alone.

19:45.414 --> 19:50.223
Oh, honey, who said
anything about being alone?

19:54.929 --> 19:57.515
There's almost nothing
as strong as a full coven,

19:57.516 --> 20:00.601
so I brought 11
of my closest friends.

20:00.602 --> 20:01.971
Won't be fun,

20:01.972 --> 20:05.306
but we're gonna cleanse you.

20:05.307 --> 20:07.975
You ready?

20:07.976 --> 20:09.359
Let's do this.

20:23.541 --> 20:25.258
Leave.

20:27.211 --> 20:28.996
Looks like Damon gave us the slip.

20:28.997 --> 20:31.849
Good. Hopefully he'll find
whatever he's looking for,

20:31.850 --> 20:36.003
and then I can take it.

20:36.004 --> 20:37.188
And what if you can't?

20:37.189 --> 20:39.724
I mean, he is stronger than you.

20:39.725 --> 20:40.941
You know, I could help you.

20:40.942 --> 20:42.109
You want the cure off the table,

20:42.110 --> 20:43.527
I want to take it.

20:43.528 --> 20:45.098
We could work together.

20:45.099 --> 20:47.697
Work together?
Don't you hate me?

20:48.121 --> 20:50.534
I hated the moral,
self-righteous version of you,

20:50.535 --> 20:52.570
but this one's not so bad.

20:52.571 --> 20:54.315
Maybe it's your new haircut.

20:54.316 --> 20:56.690
Do you remember what
it's like to be human...

20:56.691 --> 20:58.959
weak, fragile?

20:58.960 --> 21:02.380
Why would you want
to go back to that?

21:02.381 --> 21:06.033
Because someday,
I want a family' of my own.

21:06.034 --> 21:08.752
And that's exactly why
I don't want your help.

21:10.163 --> 21:11.863
The best part of having no emotions

21:11.864 --> 21:13.424
is that I can think rationally.

21:13.425 --> 21:15.259
I'll do whatever it takes
to get this done.

21:15.260 --> 21:18.311
You're the opposite, a pile
of neuroses and insecurities,

21:18.735 --> 21:20.097
hopes and dreams.

21:20.098 --> 21:21.432
You're basically
one big emotional variable

21:21.433 --> 21:25.186
that I just don't really need.

21:25.187 --> 21:27.654
You just made me
miss the old Elena.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.110
There's been two massacres.

21:33.111 --> 21:35.106
Pastor Young's farm is here,

21:35.580 --> 21:37.775
and the old Lockwood cellar,

21:37.776 --> 21:41.487
where you spitefully slaughtered
12 of your own hybrids,

21:41.488 --> 21:43.030
is here.

21:43.031 --> 21:44.705
According to the book,

21:44.706 --> 21:50.344
the expression triangle
is equilateral,

21:50.345 --> 21:52.680
putting it here.

21:52.681 --> 21:57.462
Somebody's been skipping
their geometry classes.

21:58.019 --> 21:59.970
There are actually two places

21:59.971 --> 22:05.553
where the third massacre could be.

22:06.061 --> 22:08.695
Well, you didn't let me finish.

22:12.933 --> 22:15.119
Hey. What's going on?
Did you find Bonnie?

22:15.120 --> 22:17.988
No, but I talked to her dad.

22:17.989 --> 22:22.278
I think I found Silas.

22:22.279 --> 22:24.495
Call out to the sprits, Bonnie.

22:24.496 --> 22:25.778
Let them in.

22:27.998 --> 22:31.771
Phesmatos tribum... aah!

22:31.772 --> 22:33.003
I can't.
It's hurting.

22:33.004 --> 22:34.921
It hurts! Ohh!

22:35.312 --> 22:38.092
It's because you've
rejected the spirits.

22:38.093 --> 22:41.345
The expression's consumed you.

22:41.346 --> 22:45.967
Phesmatos tribum nas ex viras...

22:45.968 --> 22:47.017
I changed my mind.

22:47.018 --> 22:48.219
Purgal animum sous...

22:48.220 --> 22:49.603
I don't want to do this anymore!

22:49.604 --> 22:51.572
- Obscarus!
- Let me go!

22:51.573 --> 22:54.275
She's fighting.
I need help.

22:54.276 --> 22:57.111
Link with me.

22:57.112 --> 22:59.697
Lend me your power.

22:59.698 --> 23:02.578
All: Phesmatos repallus tantian...

23:02.579 --> 23:03.617
[Bonnie screaming]

23:03.618 --> 23:08.955
Maltuscanum anium par vas.

23:10.674 --> 23:13.043
We need more strength!

23:13.044 --> 23:15.463
All: Phesmatos repallus tantian

23:15.464 --> 23:18.548
maltuscanum anium par vas.

23:23.552 --> 23:26.438
So Silas is appearing
as Professor Shane.

23:26.439 --> 23:27.939
Wouldn't be my first choice.

23:27.940 --> 23:29.191
Well, it would be if you
needed to brainwash Bonnie

23:29.192 --> 23:30.571
into committing a massacre.

23:30.572 --> 23:31.660
You need me to come home?

23:31.661 --> 23:32.828
No we got it.

23:32.829 --> 23:34.033
How's the cure search going?

23:34.034 --> 23:36.865
Well...
Not great.

23:36.866 --> 23:38.116
I mean, it's no massacre
in the making,

23:38.117 --> 23:41.453
but Rebekah trailed us here.

23:41.454 --> 23:44.873
Then in addition to my buddy
being a brilliant identity thief,

23:44.874 --> 23:46.258
he's also a hoarder.

23:46.259 --> 23:47.793
What are you trying to find?

23:47.794 --> 23:51.046
Will had a repeat customer,
5'7" brunette.

23:51.047 --> 23:52.881
Said she was a runner.

23:52.882 --> 23:54.216
Katherine.

23:54.217 --> 23:56.417
Turns out I was helping
her run from me.

23:56.418 --> 23:58.019
Ironic.

23:58.020 --> 23:59.221
Problem is I'm pretty sure

23:59.222 --> 24:01.089
that his filing system
goes by birthdate,

24:01.090 --> 24:02.706
but I can't for the life
of me remember Katherine's.

24:02.707 --> 24:06.194
June 5, 1473.

24:06.195 --> 24:09.763
And that, brother, is why
you are the better boyfriend.

24:11.049 --> 24:12.850
Well, will you look at that?

24:16.571 --> 24:18.673
It's all her former addresses,

24:18.674 --> 24:21.022
including a couple
from the last two months.

24:21.527 --> 24:23.161
I mean, they're mostly P.O. boxes,

24:23.162 --> 24:25.380
but, hey, it narrows the search.

24:25.381 --> 24:27.199
Well, you're welcome.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.583
So you headed back now?

24:28.584 --> 24:30.168
No. Tomorrow morning.

24:30.169 --> 24:31.465
Got to keep up the ruse

24:31.466 --> 24:32.787
for the terrible twosome outside,

24:32.788 --> 24:34.454
pretend like I'm
having a good time.

24:34.455 --> 24:35.923
And you're not?

24:37.259 --> 24:38.625
I'll tell you tomorrow.

24:39.761 --> 24:41.763
Sorry. I needed some quiet.

24:41.764 --> 24:44.082
Couldn't hear Stefan
over the runaways 2.0.

24:44.083 --> 24:46.485
Let me guess.
He's worried.

24:46.486 --> 24:49.237
Jealous mainly.
He's having acid flashbacks

24:49.238 --> 24:51.940
of me and Lexi in
the seventies in New York.

24:51.941 --> 24:54.358
I'll tell you about it
over a drink. Come on.

25:00.832 --> 25:02.617
Damon, voice-over:
Lexi stuck with me for months,

25:02.618 --> 25:05.620
partying with me,
showing me a good time,

25:05.621 --> 25:07.255
but late every night,
she'd torture me

25:07.256 --> 25:09.124
in the worst way possible.

25:09.125 --> 25:10.442
Tell me about her.

25:10.443 --> 25:11.492
No.

25:11.493 --> 25:13.616
What did she look like,

25:13.617 --> 25:15.430
what did she sound like?

25:15.431 --> 25:18.583
Tell me everything
you remember about her.

25:18.584 --> 25:20.247
Every night.

25:20.686 --> 25:22.219
And that's my cue.

25:24.306 --> 25:26.087
You have a nice fight.

25:26.088 --> 25:28.109
Try not to break anything.

25:28.110 --> 25:30.111
Mmm.

25:30.112 --> 25:31.479
Every night.

25:31.480 --> 25:34.802
Every night, we get wasted,

25:34.803 --> 25:35.901
and the second I bottom out,

25:35.902 --> 25:37.202
you have to bring up Katherine.

25:37.203 --> 25:38.557
Because you loved her,

25:38.558 --> 25:41.122
and love is the most
powerful emotion.

25:41.123 --> 25:44.075
If I can just get you to remember
how you felt about her...

25:44.076 --> 25:46.828
I don't want to remember.

25:46.829 --> 25:51.081
I mean, why do you care so much?

25:52.250 --> 25:54.969
Do you remember how we first met?

25:54.970 --> 25:57.471
It was 1864.

25:57.889 --> 25:59.724
Stefan had just killed you father,

25:59.725 --> 26:01.476
made you turn into a vampire,

26:01.477 --> 26:03.845
and he was killing his
way through Mystic Falls.

26:03.846 --> 26:06.714
You hated him.

26:06.715 --> 26:08.241
Rightfully so,

26:08.242 --> 26:11.706
but before you left,
you asked me to help him

26:11.707 --> 26:13.021
because no matter what happened,

26:13.022 --> 26:14.990
he was still your brother,

26:14.991 --> 26:17.409
and you cared about him.

26:17.410 --> 26:21.558
Now you need help,
and he cares about you.

26:21.559 --> 26:23.185
We both do.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.953
Let me help you.

26:27.954 --> 26:29.454
Tell me about Katherine.

26:29.455 --> 26:31.406
Talking about Katherine's
not gonna help me.

26:31.407 --> 26:32.611
Why not?

26:32.612 --> 26:35.710
Because she's not
the person I care about.

26:35.711 --> 26:37.878
[Music playing]

26:42.884 --> 26:45.186
It flipped.

26:45.187 --> 26:48.372
The switch.
Why didn't you tell me?

26:48.373 --> 26:51.610
Because I barely felt it at first,

26:51.611 --> 26:55.030
but every night,
it's gotten stronger.

26:55.031 --> 26:57.731
It worked.

26:58.116 --> 27:00.734
You worked.

27:18.003 --> 27:20.743
Elena, voice-over: You and Lexi?

27:20.744 --> 27:22.289
Here on the bar?

27:22.766 --> 27:25.056
On the bar, on the stage,
on the roof.

27:25.057 --> 27:26.540
It was a very long night.

27:26.541 --> 27:28.095
Yeeh.

27:34.402 --> 27:36.637
Where you going?

27:36.638 --> 27:38.073
To the roof.

27:38.074 --> 27:41.326
I want to hear the rest
of the story.

27:41.327 --> 27:43.077
Ok.

27:57.459 --> 28:00.211
Excuse you.

28:00.212 --> 28:02.263
I just want to see where we are.

28:02.264 --> 28:03.682
You know, when we split up,

28:03.683 --> 28:05.517
you did have the option
of going with Stefan.

28:05.518 --> 28:07.218
Yeah? And leave Bonnie's
life your hands?

28:07.219 --> 28:08.436
Fat chance.

28:08.437 --> 28:09.804
Do you even know how to read a map?

28:09.805 --> 28:11.806
Yes, and do you know who taught me?

28:11.807 --> 28:13.058
My friend Magellan.

28:13.059 --> 28:15.443
Wow! You had a friend.

28:15.444 --> 28:17.779
Was he drawn to your darkness, too?

28:17.780 --> 28:20.031
Actually, I was referring to
Damon and Elena when I said that,

28:20.032 --> 28:22.200
but clearly it struck
a chord with you.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.035
It's because it's not true!

28:24.036 --> 28:26.287
There is no allure to darkness.

28:26.288 --> 28:28.707
Really? So you've
never felt the attraction

28:28.708 --> 28:31.981
that comes when someone who's
capable of doing terrible things

28:31.982 --> 28:35.046
for some reason
cares only about you?

28:35.047 --> 28:39.488
I did once when I thought
he was worth it,

28:39.489 --> 28:44.350
but it turns out some
people can't be fixed.

28:44.351 --> 28:47.008
People who do terrible things

28:47.009 --> 28:50.978
are just terrible people.

28:54.858 --> 28:57.047
We're here,

28:57.048 --> 28:59.437
although judging
by the lack of witches,

28:59.438 --> 29:02.741
here is not the correct location.

29:02.742 --> 29:05.110
Yield to the spirits, Bonnie!

29:05.111 --> 29:07.523
- Aah!
- You can't fight us!

29:07.524 --> 29:09.310
[Sobbing]

29:09.782 --> 29:11.812
Stop it. It's not what you think.

29:11.813 --> 29:13.568
This is no place for a vampire.

29:13.569 --> 29:16.004
She's working for Silas.

29:16.005 --> 29:17.122
Silas?

29:17.123 --> 29:19.340
He brainwashed her to kill you.

29:19.341 --> 29:22.127
[Whimpers]

29:22.128 --> 29:23.378
Wait. What are you doing?

29:23.379 --> 29:25.282
If Silas has her, she's lost.

29:25.283 --> 29:26.911
We can't save her.

29:30.852 --> 29:34.973
I have the power of 12 witches.

29:34.974 --> 29:36.857
You don't stand a chance!

29:51.268 --> 29:53.220
They're linked.
Bonnie's gonna kill them.

29:53.221 --> 29:55.556
Not if the witches kill her first.

29:55.557 --> 29:56.640
Ugh!

29:56.641 --> 29:57.942
Klaus, we need to save her.

29:57.943 --> 29:59.944
How? The only way
to stop the witches

29:59.945 --> 30:04.198
is to kill them,
and then Silas gets what he wants.

30:04.199 --> 30:07.318
Aja: Spirits, take her soul.

30:07.319 --> 30:10.487
Free her from darkness.

30:10.488 --> 30:12.989
[Screaming]

30:15.876 --> 30:18.212
- Aah!
- No!

30:40.050 --> 30:41.435
Bonnie.

30:41.436 --> 30:42.852
Bonnie!

30:47.324 --> 30:49.459
The triangle is complete.

30:54.832 --> 30:57.868
It's beautiful up here.

30:57.869 --> 31:00.788
I could do this, you know?

31:00.789 --> 31:02.706
The Lexi method.

31:02.707 --> 31:05.376
Hang with you, party with you.

31:05.377 --> 31:08.262
It wouldn't be the worst way
to turn my emotions back on.

31:08.263 --> 31:09.805
I thought you hated emotions.

31:09.806 --> 31:15.312
I do. Maybe I'm just
looking for an excuse to...

31:16.221 --> 31:18.254
Spend more time with you.

31:23.861 --> 31:26.846
I've never done it
on a rooftop before.

31:33.203 --> 31:37.324
You're not missing much.

31:37.325 --> 31:39.543
You don't have to take
the high road, Damon.

31:39.544 --> 31:41.412
I'm not sired to you anymore.

31:41.413 --> 31:45.014
I want this.
You want this.

32:09.440 --> 32:11.475
What?

32:11.476 --> 32:14.828
Looking for that?

32:14.829 --> 32:16.146
You really think
that was gonna work,

32:16.147 --> 32:19.249
the sex, the temptation, the booze?

32:19.250 --> 32:21.285
What, are you kidding me?

32:21.286 --> 32:23.202
I invented that trick.

32:37.267 --> 32:39.770
[Sizzling]

32:44.641 --> 32:46.110
Damon: Good luck!

32:46.111 --> 32:49.730
Spent all night reinforcing it.

32:49.731 --> 32:51.181
It was tough.

32:51.182 --> 32:53.734
Had to be really quiet
not to wake you up.

32:53.735 --> 32:55.955
What is this?

32:56.866 --> 32:59.648
- Payment.
- For what?

33:01.326 --> 33:05.195
Oh, for the last
6 months of my life,

33:05.196 --> 33:06.413
for the nagging

33:06.414 --> 33:07.890
for the self-righteous platitudes.

33:07.891 --> 33:10.917
I'm paying you back
for 6 months of you.

33:10.918 --> 33:15.089
Your humanity isn't back on, is it?

33:15.090 --> 33:16.722
Never was.

33:16.723 --> 33:19.143
So this was all just...
a joke!

33:19.144 --> 33:21.729
It was a big, fat lie.

33:21.730 --> 33:24.648
Best part of it is,
you believed it.

33:24.649 --> 33:27.401
You thought I was a like Stefan,

33:27.402 --> 33:32.072
a wounded little bird that you
could nurse back to health,

33:32.073 --> 33:34.858
but he's a victim.

33:34.859 --> 33:36.910
I choose to be this way.

33:37.328 --> 33:41.281
Aah!

33:41.282 --> 33:43.500
Enjoy the day.

33:43.501 --> 33:45.127
I hear it's gonna be a scorcher.

33:51.195 --> 33:52.793
So you pretended
to have feelings for her

33:52.794 --> 33:54.386
just to get her off your back?

33:54.387 --> 33:56.713
I was willing to do
whatever it took.

33:56.714 --> 33:58.465
Sound familiar?

33:58.466 --> 34:00.050
Aw. I hurt your feelings.

34:00.051 --> 34:02.589
Not my feelings.
I'm looking out for you

34:02.590 --> 34:05.105
because one day,
you will flip that switch back on,

34:05.106 --> 34:07.024
and all the bad stuff that you did

34:07.025 --> 34:08.275
is gonna come rushing back,

34:08.275 --> 34:10.760
and it is going to suck.

34:10.761 --> 34:13.614
So you're saying
that you felt bad for Lexi?

34:13.614 --> 34:15.098
She became a walking,
talking reminder

34:15.099 --> 34:18.068
of all the awful things I'd done.

34:18.069 --> 34:20.370
I managed to avoid her for decades,

34:20.371 --> 34:22.656
and then she just shows
up in Mystic Falls

34:22.657 --> 34:24.440
to wish my baby bro Happy Birthday,

34:24.442 --> 34:29.880
and boom...
rush of memories, rush of guilt.

34:29.880 --> 34:31.297
So you kill her?

34:31.299 --> 34:33.717
Out of sight, out of mind.

34:34.284 --> 34:35.636
Every day that you're like this

34:35.637 --> 34:36.953
is the day that you
might do the one thing

34:36.954 --> 34:38.755
that you can't take back.

34:38.755 --> 34:40.623
Here's what I don't get.

34:40.625 --> 34:42.842
You spent 6 months trying to
get her to fall in love with you

34:42.844 --> 34:44.638
just so that you could hurt her.

34:44.639 --> 34:49.132
You were spiteful,
malicious, borderline evil,

34:49.132 --> 34:51.819
and you say that you had
your emotions turned off,

34:51.820 --> 34:53.570
but those all sound
like emotions to me.

34:53.571 --> 34:54.855
Maybe they were.
Maybe hatred was

34:54.856 --> 34:56.607
the first one I got back.

34:56.608 --> 34:58.158
All the more reason to cure you.

34:58.693 --> 35:00.310
That way,
we get the normal Elena back

35:00.311 --> 35:02.112
without all the ugly
stages in between.

35:02.113 --> 35:04.998
I'm not taking the cure, Damon.

35:04.999 --> 35:07.417
Yes, you are,
even if I have to break your neck

35:07.418 --> 35:10.319
or tie you up in chains
until we find it.

35:11.154 --> 35:12.655
[Crack]

35:14.758 --> 35:17.593
What was that you said about
handling things yourself?

35:31.093 --> 35:33.095
Hey.

35:33.096 --> 35:34.262
How you feeling?

35:34.263 --> 35:37.248
What are you doing here?
How'd I get here?

35:37.249 --> 35:39.669
What do you mean?
I... I brought you home.

35:39.670 --> 35:43.022
- The witches almost killed you.
- What witches?

35:43.824 --> 35:45.774
You don't remember?

35:50.079 --> 35:54.266
Whatever the witches did must
have messed with your memory.

35:54.267 --> 35:56.068
How did I get off the island?

35:56.069 --> 35:59.839
[Music playing]

35:59.840 --> 36:02.907
Wait. Bonnie...

36:02.908 --> 36:05.962
What's the last thing
you can remember?

36:05.963 --> 36:09.815
I guess I remember
being in that cave,

36:09.816 --> 36:15.520
and Jeremy was trying to pry
the cure out of Silas' hands.

36:17.884 --> 36:20.591
Please tell me he got it.

36:23.029 --> 36:24.646
We didn't get it, did we?

36:26.532 --> 36:29.124
Bonnie, there's something you
need to know about Jeremy.

36:34.640 --> 36:38.686
There. 12 graves for 12 witches.

36:38.687 --> 36:41.414
Like it never happened.

36:41.415 --> 36:44.583
Only it did happen,

36:44.584 --> 36:46.886
and now Silas has
everything he needs

36:46.887 --> 36:50.840
to open the gates to hell on earth.

36:50.841 --> 36:53.094
You were just gonna let Bonnie die.

36:53.095 --> 36:54.510
I know arithmetic
isn't your strong point,

36:54.511 --> 36:56.943
but one is still less than 12.

36:56.944 --> 36:59.449
Yeah, but that one
is my best friend.

36:59.450 --> 37:01.100
You tell yourself
whatever you need to

37:01.101 --> 37:03.735
so you can sleep at night.

37:07.690 --> 37:10.275
I just killed 12 people.

37:16.567 --> 37:20.369
Hey. Hey.

37:20.370 --> 37:23.088
You look like you're
in need of comfort.

37:29.545 --> 37:33.772
Why don't you find someone less
terrible you can relate to?

37:57.456 --> 38:00.692
Thank you.

38:00.693 --> 38:04.386
Of the 3 massacres,
this is the one I was dreading.

38:04.387 --> 38:07.015
Silas I presume.

38:17.309 --> 38:21.013
[Phone ringing]

38:21.014 --> 38:23.488
- Elena: Morning, Damon.
- Where are you?

38:23.984 --> 38:26.819
The better question would
be where are we going?

38:26.820 --> 38:28.886
Sorry, Damon.
I think I broke your radio.

38:29.307 --> 38:30.889
You're in my car?!

38:30.890 --> 38:33.692
Heh. We weren't gonna take the bus.

38:33.693 --> 38:35.861
I wish this could have
gone differently.

38:35.862 --> 38:38.831
I really do,
but we'll give Katherine your best.

38:38.832 --> 38:41.232
[Music playing]

38:45.538 --> 38:47.372
[Tires squeal]

38:50.828 --> 38:52.428
Damon, what did you do?

38:52.429 --> 38:54.413
Let's just say it involves
a 5'7" brunette

38:54.414 --> 38:56.298
and her blond accomplice.

38:56.299 --> 38:57.850
Please don't tell me this is
going where I think it is.

38:57.851 --> 38:59.417
Wrong fantasy, brother,

38:59.879 --> 39:02.855
unless you're into
betrayal and snapped necks.

39:02.856 --> 39:05.756
The lead I had on
Katherine Elena stole.

39:08.027 --> 39:11.697
If you're searching for the words
to tell me how badly I screwed up,

39:11.698 --> 39:13.265
save your breath.

39:13.266 --> 39:15.123
I didn't stop the massacre.

39:18.387 --> 39:20.738
Guess Silas has
everything he needs.

39:20.739 --> 39:22.440
Everything but the cure.

39:23.943 --> 39:26.612
I'm sorry, mate.

39:26.613 --> 39:28.380
Don't have it.

39:28.381 --> 39:29.679
But you know who does,

39:29.680 --> 39:31.831
and the last thing that you want

39:31.832 --> 39:35.454
is for that cure to be used on you,
so you bring it to me,

39:35.455 --> 39:37.723
and it won't be.

39:37.724 --> 39:40.125
You get to live.

39:40.126 --> 39:44.796
Heh. Yeah. With all of
my dead supernatural enemies

39:44.797 --> 39:46.599
from the other side.

39:46.600 --> 39:48.901
You know, you don't
scare me, Silas,

39:48.902 --> 39:53.439
or, Shane, or, whoever you are.

39:53.440 --> 39:55.306
I think I know what does.

39:57.943 --> 39:59.912
Hmm?

39:59.913 --> 40:02.748
Now where did you get that?

40:02.749 --> 40:04.500
Well, let's just say
your sister's mind

40:04.501 --> 40:06.633
is a little easier
to read than yours.

40:09.421 --> 40:11.707
So...

40:11.708 --> 40:13.932
Care to reconsider my offer?

40:20.599 --> 40:24.470
Guhh!
Aah!

40:24.471 --> 40:27.139
I missed by an inch,
but don't worry.

40:27.140 --> 40:29.508
I'm not trying to kill you,
not just yet.

40:29.509 --> 40:32.695
Aah!

40:32.696 --> 40:36.615
Just a little something
to remember me by.

40:36.616 --> 40:38.015
I'll be in touch.
