[LAUGHTER AND CHEERING]

01:19:45.912 --> 01:19:47.848
WEEBLE: Hello? Hello?

01:19:49.016 --> 01:19:50.284
Anyone?

01:19:52.988 --> 01:19:55.289
CRAWLEY: <i>I like to have fun
as much as the next guy.</i>

01:19:55.657 --> 01:19:58.393
The entire hive was searching
throughout the night.

01:19:58.626 --> 01:20:00.793
You travelled far beyond
the realms of the meadow

01:20:00.795 --> 01:20:02.864
without even telling anyone
where you were going.

01:20:03.131 --> 01:20:06.031
Ah! I mean,
the Queen was sick with worry.

01:20:06.033 --> 01:20:08.136
Her hair couldn't get
any whiter!

01:20:09.069 --> 01:20:09.970
Uh.

01:20:12.405 --> 01:20:14.039
He's right, you know!

01:20:14.041 --> 01:20:15.942
It's very white.

01:20:15.944 --> 01:20:17.111
Thank you, Crawley.

01:20:17.778 --> 01:20:20.515
But the most
important thing is...

01:20:21.015 --> 01:20:22.815
Um... pollen?

01:20:22.817 --> 01:20:25.186
[LAUGHS] No, Willi.

01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:27.756
Is that you're safe!

01:20:28.823 --> 01:20:30.291
I thought we'd lost you.

01:20:30.692 --> 01:20:32.661
Don't ever run away
like that again.

01:20:34.061 --> 01:20:35.296
Yes, Miss Queen.

01:20:36.796 --> 01:20:40.433
Your adventure was reckless,
but what you did for Greenleaf

01:20:40.435 --> 01:20:44.035
was courageous, brave,
and very special.

01:20:44.037 --> 01:20:46.306
[GASPS] So you're not going
to split us up?

01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:49.510
[CHUCKLES]
Split up best friends?

01:20:49.844 --> 01:20:50.845
Never!

01:20:51.145 --> 01:20:54.049
[LAUGHTER]

01:20:54.881 --> 01:20:55.783
Phew!

[CROWD CHEERING]

01:20:58.619 --> 01:21:00.921
Lady Bugs and Gentle Bees,

01:21:01.255 --> 01:21:04.559
the Spring Festival
is officially open!

01:21:05.158 --> 01:21:06.161
Crawley?

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:15.034

The Sun Stone! [CHUCKLES]

Hit the lights.
