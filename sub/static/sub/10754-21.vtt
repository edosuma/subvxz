WEBVTT

00:09.300 --> 00:11.927
You're on KACL
with Dr Frasier Crane.

00:12.094 --> 00:14.472
We have time for one more call.

00:14.639 --> 00:16.891
Hello, Gretchen. I'm listening.

00:17.058 --> 00:21.645
(Gretchen) 'Well, you see, Dr Crane,
my husband is a fencing instructor

00:21.812 --> 00:26.192
'and lately he spends all his time
with his wealthy new student

00:26.358 --> 00:30.029
'and I'm afraid
there's some <i>bumsen</i> going on.'

00:31.947 --> 00:38.078
- Do you have any evidence?
- 'No, it's just a feeling.'

00:38.245 --> 00:42.416
Well, in these matters, there's
no simple way to know for sure.

00:42.583 --> 00:44.627
Yes, there is.

00:45.878 --> 00:47.963
Well, Gretchen, you're in luck.

00:48.130 --> 00:50.799
It just so happens
we have in our studio today

00:50.966 --> 00:54.428
one of the world's
five leading <i>bumsen</i> experts.

00:55.596 --> 01:00.642
lf you want to know if a man is cheating,
you offer him two choices for dinner,

01:00.809 --> 01:03.520
one that's fattening and one that's light.

01:03.687 --> 01:05.731
lf he picks the calorie packed one,

01:05.898 --> 01:07.941
he doesn't mind turning into a pig,

01:08.108 --> 01:10.861
which means he's happily married.

01:11.028 --> 01:14.072
Hearing advice like that,
I wish there was a law against

01:14.239 --> 01:16.617
women gathering at a water cooler.

01:18.243 --> 01:21.371
- Now, Gretchen...
- 'Does it really work, Roz?'

01:21.538 --> 01:24.833
- Oh, trust me.
- 'I'm going to do it.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.127
'Thank you for your help, Roz.

01:27.294 --> 01:31.757
- 'Oh, and you too, Dr Crane.'
- Don't mention it.

01:31.923 --> 01:36.428
Well, Dr Crane
and friends will be back tomorrow.

01:36.595 --> 01:38.722
Thanks for listening, Seattle.

01:41.099 --> 01:45.145
- I know you hate it when I butt in.
- And yet...

01:45.312 --> 01:49.024
You'll forgive me when you find out
what I'm doing for you.

01:49.191 --> 01:52.027
There's this woman
who lives in my building.

01:52.194 --> 01:56.615
- She's beautiful and funny.
- Stop. I do not go out on blind dates.

01:56.781 --> 01:59.034
They're demeaning and a waste of time.

01:59.200 --> 02:02.454
- No, thank you. No.
- It's for your father.

02:02.621 --> 02:04.789
What time should he pick her up?

02:04.956 --> 02:08.752
Wait a minute. They are OK
for your father, but not for you?

02:08.918 --> 02:13.757
Yes. And games with balls, beer and
giant trucks that roll over small ones.

02:17.135 --> 02:20.013
"So you want to build
a three-masted schooner.

02:20.180 --> 02:23.141
"Before assembly,
take inventory of all parts."

02:23.308 --> 02:25.685
- We don't need to read that.
- We do.

02:25.852 --> 02:28.980
It says here, in bold,
"Read all instructions".

02:29.147 --> 02:31.357
Pass me the right side of the hull.

02:31.524 --> 02:35.445
You'll get that piece at Step 16
and not a moment sooner.

02:35.612 --> 02:39.198
- Can we get started here?
- All right, Dad.

02:40.283 --> 02:43.328
"So you want to build
a three-masted schooner."

02:43.494 --> 02:47.248
Give me that! You'll put your eye out.

02:49.375 --> 02:52.879
Look at that! What a beautiful ship!

02:53.046 --> 02:57.216
- I bet you'll have fun building that.
- Not as much fun as reading about it.

02:57.383 --> 03:01.888
Did I ever mention one of my ancestors
was a mutineer on HMS Bounty.

03:02.054 --> 03:03.514
(Martin) No kidding.

03:03.681 --> 03:08.686
He made it safely to Pitcairn Island
where he was fruitful and multiplied.

03:08.853 --> 03:12.648
For all I know, there's some girl
who looks exactly like me

03:12.815 --> 03:15.568
in the South Seas,
frolicking in the surf,

03:15.735 --> 03:18.112
brown-skinned and bare breasted.

03:24.535 --> 03:27.621
So you want to build
a two-masted schooner?

03:28.497 --> 03:30.875
Schooner? I thought it was a frigate.

03:31.041 --> 03:33.294
A frigate has a fore-and-aft mainsail.

03:33.461 --> 03:36.630
- That's a brigantine.
- Well, what's a frigate?

03:36.797 --> 03:39.758
That's when you just don't give a damn.

03:44.430 --> 03:46.807
- Hello.
- Hello there.

03:46.974 --> 03:49.018
Are you spending
the evening with us?

03:49.184 --> 03:52.271
Yes. Maris misses me,
but feels family comes first.

03:52.438 --> 03:55.774
She saw this model
and felt I should share it with Dad.

03:55.941 --> 03:59.403
- She wanted you out of the house?
- Like a musty smell.

04:01.113 --> 04:03.741
Dad, I have a proposal for you.

04:03.907 --> 04:08.495
There's a woman in Roz's building
that would like to go out with you.

04:08.662 --> 04:11.331
Roz says she's got
a wonderful personality.

04:11.498 --> 04:14.293
Oh, I guess that means
I'm the pretty one.

04:17.796 --> 04:21.550
- Tell Roz thanks but no thanks.
- You're making a mistake.

04:21.716 --> 04:25.596
Trying new things is what keeps us
all young and vibrant.

04:25.762 --> 04:30.225
You're right. For weeks Maris floated
in a sensory deprivation tank,

04:30.392 --> 04:34.479
but she's taken up fencing
and I've never seen her more vital.

04:36.857 --> 04:41.486
She stays up late into the evening,
working with her instructor.

04:42.571 --> 04:45.782
- Maris has a fencing instructor?
- Yes.

04:45.949 --> 04:49.536
Gunnar was the Bavarian champion
three years running.

04:49.703 --> 04:52.622
He's Bavarian?

04:53.123 --> 04:56.376
You're full of questions
I've already answered.

04:56.543 --> 04:58.587
Am I?

05:01.298 --> 05:06.219
He speaks no English. Maris practises
German while she parries and thrusts.

05:07.971 --> 05:10.056
Maris is learning German, huh?

05:10.223 --> 05:13.601
Just when you thought
she couldn't get any cuddlier.

05:16.312 --> 05:20.650
- Dad, did you take the spanking aft?
- Yeah, I pre-glued it for you.

05:20.817 --> 05:23.319
- Good job!
- Not to worry.

05:23.486 --> 05:26.239
This used to happen
to my brothers all the time.

05:26.406 --> 05:29.784
I can get it off with nail polish remover.
Come with me.

05:29.951 --> 05:34.622
- So your brothers built models?
- No, I suspect they just sniffed glue.

05:35.707 --> 05:39.961
- That can cause brain damage.
- Well, then, that confirms it.

05:40.128 --> 05:43.548
Dad. Dad.
I have to talk to you about Niles.

05:43.715 --> 05:47.844
I got a call from a German woman
whose husband is a fencing instructor

05:48.011 --> 05:52.515
that she suspects is having
an affair with his wealthy new client.

05:53.391 --> 05:57.145
- And?
- Don't you find it incriminating?

05:57.311 --> 06:00.022
It's a coincidence. Seattle's a big city.

06:00.189 --> 06:03.943
I'm sure German fencing instructors
have dozens of students.

06:04.110 --> 06:05.903
But are they wealthy?

06:06.070 --> 06:10.575
No. They're working their way out
of the ghetto with a foil and a dream (!)

06:12.535 --> 06:15.413
In the midst
of that slag heap of sarcasm,

06:15.580 --> 06:17.623
there may be a kernel of truth.

06:17.790 --> 06:21.043
I could be letting my imagination
run away with me.

06:21.210 --> 06:24.130
Forget it.
Help me put this model together.

06:24.297 --> 06:28.175
Oh, my God. I remember how
Niles used to love these models.

06:28.342 --> 06:32.680
Remember that Christmas Mum got him
"The Visible Man And Woman"?

06:32.847 --> 06:36.851
- He had to glue the internal organs.
- I remember you two fighting.

06:37.017 --> 06:39.937
He got on my nerves,
so I stole his ovaries.

06:43.524 --> 06:47.361
There's a conversation
I'm glad I missed the beginning of.

06:51.991 --> 06:56.078
- Sorry I'm late.
- Did you ask your dad about the date?

06:56.245 --> 06:58.289
- He's not interested.
- Darn it.

06:58.455 --> 07:01.959
I got her hopes up.
Would you consider going out with her?

07:02.126 --> 07:04.753
Sorry. I've had my quota of pity dates.

07:04.920 --> 07:08.716
But this time you wouldn't be
the one being pitied.

07:10.300 --> 07:13.595
We have a great call
to start the show off with.

07:13.762 --> 07:17.349
The guy on line three
found out his girlfriend is his sister!

07:17.516 --> 07:18.976
Wow!

07:19.143 --> 07:22.020
- That German woman called back.
- Gretchen?

07:22.187 --> 07:24.356
- Yeah.
- I want her first.

07:24.523 --> 07:26.984
What do I say
to the guy dating his sister?

07:27.150 --> 07:30.070
Tell him to hang on.
We've all been there.

07:33.865 --> 07:37.119
Hello, Seattle.
This is Dr Frasier Crane on KACL.

07:37.286 --> 07:39.121
Roz?

07:39.288 --> 07:41.581
Gretchen's calling
about her husband's affair.

07:41.748 --> 07:44.126
She thinks she has more evidence.

07:44.292 --> 07:48.630
- I'm listening.
- (Gretchen) 'I took Roz's advice.

07:48.797 --> 07:51.633
'I gave my husband
two choices for dinner

07:51.800 --> 07:55.137
'and he picked the diet plate!'

07:55.303 --> 07:57.764
That is no proof he's having an affair.

07:57.931 --> 08:01.017
- 'But Gunnar has a healthy appetite.'
- No, no, no.

08:01.184 --> 08:05.480
The proof is...phone bills,
credit card receipts... Gunnar?

08:09.442 --> 08:12.070
I also found a love letter.

08:12.237 --> 08:14.698
How long were you
going to keep that secret?

08:14.864 --> 08:16.908
What does it say?

08:17.075 --> 08:19.369
(Gretchen speaks German)

08:19.536 --> 08:24.749
- I'm sorry. I don't speak German.
- 'It's means my little liver dumpling.

08:24.916 --> 08:29.963
- 'That used to be his pet name for me.'
- Maybe he's writing to you.

08:30.130 --> 08:34.259
'It can't be me. He says he loves
her beautiful, little body,

08:34.424 --> 08:38.096
'as thin as his sword
and her skin as white as bratwurst,

08:38.263 --> 08:41.975
'and that she's
his <i>nicht eine menschliche Frau.</i>'

08:42.140 --> 08:46.729
- What is that?
- 'I don't know if there's an English word.

08:46.896 --> 08:52.360
'The closest translation
is "not quite human woman".'

08:57.490 --> 09:00.201
- Dear God. It is her.
- 'What should I do?'

09:00.368 --> 09:04.330
I don't know. I need time to think.
Let's go to commercial.

09:09.168 --> 09:12.713
Hello. Gretchen,
I have considered your problem.

09:12.880 --> 09:17.218
You must confront your husband
and insist that he end this affair.

09:17.385 --> 09:21.681
- (Gretchen) 'What if he won't?'
- But innocent people are being hurt.

09:21.847 --> 09:24.809
Tell him how much he means to you.
Are there children?

09:24.976 --> 09:28.479
- 'No.'
- Damn!

09:28.646 --> 09:32.525
Still, it must be a clean break.
He must never see this woman again.

09:32.692 --> 09:35.194
'We never had
these problems back home.'

09:35.361 --> 09:39.365
Maybe you should return
to the loving bosom of Bavaria.

09:39.532 --> 09:42.910
'How did you know
we were from Bavaria?'

09:46.247 --> 09:48.499
Well, I'm a master of dialect.

09:48.666 --> 09:53.587
I noticed there was a glottal quality
to the occlusion of your diphthongs.

09:53.754 --> 09:56.549
'I'm originally from Austria.'

09:56.715 --> 10:00.010
Do you want to split hairs
or get your husband back?

10:00.177 --> 10:02.513
It's time for another commercial.

10:02.680 --> 10:06.475
- Another commercial?
- Yes, another commercial!

10:08.686 --> 10:10.729
What is going on?

10:10.896 --> 10:12.940
Why do you think something's going on?

10:13.107 --> 10:17.403
When the person giving advice
sounds crazier than the caller,

10:17.569 --> 10:19.947
I think something's going on.

10:20.114 --> 10:22.491
Nothing's going on.

10:22.658 --> 10:26.245
You know who the liver dumpling is,
don't you?

10:27.871 --> 10:32.543
Yes. But it's nobody you know.
Her husband's a friend of mine.

10:32.709 --> 10:36.171
- How can I tell him?
- Don't tell the person being cheated on.

10:36.338 --> 10:40.425
Confront the person who's cheating.
Didn't Harvard teach you anything?

10:40.592 --> 10:42.594
I can't do that.

10:42.761 --> 10:46.473
You tell her you know
she's been mattress surfing

10:46.640 --> 10:48.767
and if she won't stop, you'll tell.

10:49.851 --> 10:54.398
It's not that easy. You don't know her.
She can't deal with confrontation.

10:54.564 --> 10:56.983
I once questioned her for serving veal

10:57.150 --> 11:01.196
and we found her in the garage
with the engine running on a golf cart.

11:01.363 --> 11:04.074
Whoa, it's Maris!

11:06.000 --> 11:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:13.875 --> 11:15.919
(Woman speaks Spanish)

11:16.086 --> 11:18.338
Mrs Crane is in the box?

11:24.719 --> 11:27.847
Maris! This is Frasier.

11:28.014 --> 11:31.351
I'm tired of waiting for you
to come out of this ridiculous tank.

11:31.518 --> 11:33.770
We've got to talk about Niles.

11:34.854 --> 11:36.898
Will you come out of there?

11:37.774 --> 11:39.818
Look, Maris...

11:41.277 --> 11:43.530
I know you're having an affair.

11:44.614 --> 11:49.327
I care for you both and I want to help
you do what's best for your marriage.

11:50.870 --> 11:52.914
Will you stop this?

11:54.207 --> 11:57.043
Just come... Come out of this box!

11:57.210 --> 11:59.754
All right, I'm going to open the door.

11:59.921 --> 12:03.508
I'm going to count to three.
I don't care if you're naked.

12:03.675 --> 12:05.718
I'm going to count to ten.

12:07.804 --> 12:10.014
To hell with this! All right!

12:20.608 --> 12:23.486
Niles, I'm so sorry.

12:23.653 --> 12:26.614
Marta, you said
Mrs Crane was in the box?

12:26.781 --> 12:30.076
- Si, Missy Crane.
- That's Mr Crane!

12:31.202 --> 12:34.330
Marta has trouble with her pronouns.

12:39.543 --> 12:43.672
- I'm worried. He's sensitive.
- You're right.

12:43.839 --> 12:48.636
Maybe we shouldn't let on how worried
we are. It will add to his anxiety.

12:48.803 --> 12:51.222
lf we coddle him,
he'll think the world's ended.

12:51.388 --> 12:53.432
(Doorbell)

12:55.726 --> 12:57.937
- Hello, Niles.
- Hi, Son.

12:59.813 --> 13:05.110
It's OK. It's OK, Niles. Come on.

13:05.277 --> 13:07.321
It's all right.

13:08.739 --> 13:12.284
- We're all here for you, son.
- My little brother.

13:13.243 --> 13:15.663
Frasier, pour him a glass of brandy.

13:15.829 --> 13:21.085
Yes. Oh, God. I'm all out of brandy.
I have a marvellous sherry,

13:21.251 --> 13:25.839
some fine ports and a lovely bottle
of 12-year-old unblended Scotch.

13:26.006 --> 13:29.468
- It's a bit peaty...
- Just pour him a drink!

13:30.260 --> 13:33.889
- What happened, son?
- Nothing.

13:34.056 --> 13:36.350
Nothing?
When I left, you were about to

13:36.517 --> 13:39.394
storm up to her room
and have it out with her?

13:39.561 --> 13:44.274
I thought of questions to fire at her,
but when I reached her door I froze.

13:44.441 --> 13:49.112
I turned and walked out of the house,
got in the car and started driving.

13:49.279 --> 13:51.323
I'm glad you ended up here.

13:51.490 --> 13:54.660
Actually, I ended up
at the Oregon border check.

13:56.745 --> 14:00.624
I had fruit in the car,
so I had to turn back.

14:07.214 --> 14:10.133
What will I do? She's my whole life.

14:10.300 --> 14:15.096
She may have temporarily succumbed
to Gunnar's Teutonic charms,

14:15.263 --> 14:20.644
but in the end I'm sure she'll choose
the man who's intelligent and sensitive.

14:20.810 --> 14:25.565
Frasier, that's just something
we used to tell ourselves in chess club.

14:30.195 --> 14:33.406
The truth is
women don't want men of intellect.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.742
They want men of action, like Gunnar.

14:35.909 --> 14:39.621
It has nothing to do with Gunnar.
It's about you and Maris.

14:39.788 --> 14:43.249
Remember your advice
when I had problems with Lilith?

14:43.416 --> 14:47.921
You said I should talk to her
and find out why she did what she did.

14:48.087 --> 14:51.633
It's one thing to give advice,
another to take it.

14:51.799 --> 14:58.932
Frase, didn't you and Lilith write articles
on the keys to a successful marriage?

14:59.098 --> 15:02.101
- Yes.
- It might help Niles to read them.

15:02.268 --> 15:04.312
Well, all right.

15:04.479 --> 15:08.316
I've only got half. Lilith got the rest
in the divorce settlement.

15:10.777 --> 15:14.906
Now that we got rid of the foghorn,
here's the way to handle it.

15:15.073 --> 15:18.201
Remember this happened
between your mother and I?

15:18.367 --> 15:21.871
- Right.
- Well, I took it up with the other man.

15:22.038 --> 15:25.875
I told him if it ever happened again,
he'd be the other woman.

15:26.042 --> 15:28.252
There was a lot more that we had to do

15:28.419 --> 15:33.049
to keep our marriage together,
but at least she knew how much I cared.

15:33.216 --> 15:37.845
Should I grab Gunnar by the scruff
of the neck and throw him out?

15:38.012 --> 15:40.848
- Why not?
- I've been fantasising about it.

15:41.015 --> 15:44.894
It's just not me, though.
Although maybe it should be me.

15:45.061 --> 15:47.688
No, I've got to speak to Maris eventually.

15:47.855 --> 15:52.693
Although, if I do it your way,
I'm going at it from a position of strength.

15:52.860 --> 15:57.656
I'll do it, Dad. Tonight it's Gunnar
who will be taught a lesson.

15:57.823 --> 16:01.827
- That's my boy. Sure you're up to it?
- Yes, I am.

16:01.994 --> 16:07.166
I'm pumped, I'm psyched and I just
swallowed an entire twist of lemon.

16:08.042 --> 16:11.754
- Did I just hear Niles leave?
- He went to straighten out Gunnar.

16:11.921 --> 16:16.842
God, Dad, how could you let him go?
What if Gunnar wants to fight?

16:17.009 --> 16:20.512
It's still better this way.
He's found his manhood.

16:20.679 --> 16:24.266
I'll be happy if he traded in
some teeth for his cojones.

16:28.437 --> 16:32.483
I've got to stop walking in
on the middle of conversations.

16:41.325 --> 16:45.245
There you are.
Yes, I'm talking to you, strudel boy!

16:47.539 --> 16:50.042
No one gets away
with seducing my wife.

16:50.208 --> 16:55.422
You probably thought, because of my
swimmer's build, I wouldn't fight for her,

16:55.589 --> 16:59.676
but you're wrong, because real men
have a thing called honour.

16:59.843 --> 17:02.095
Yow!

17:02.262 --> 17:04.306
You wouldn't know about that.

17:04.473 --> 17:06.558
- Niles.
- You don't know how to behave.

17:06.724 --> 17:09.227
You don't know
the meaning of rectitude.

17:09.394 --> 17:13.272
He doesn't know the meaning of dog.
He doesn't speak English!

17:14.816 --> 17:18.111
(Speaking in German)

17:18.278 --> 17:20.113
Marta?

17:21.031 --> 17:23.074
You speak German?

17:27.871 --> 17:29.915
(Speaking Spanish)

17:34.878 --> 17:39.341
She worked for a German family
that turned up in Guatemala...

17:39.507 --> 17:41.551
just after the war.

17:45.472 --> 17:48.308
Good. She can translate.
Tell her to tell him...

17:48.475 --> 17:50.518
Niles, just wait!

17:50.685 --> 17:54.939
lf he knew you were calling him strudel
boy, he'd wipe his feet on your face.

17:55.106 --> 17:58.443
lf there are scuffs,
they'll be scuffs of honour.

17:58.610 --> 18:01.946
How dare you steal my wife!
Translate.

18:02.113 --> 18:04.073
All right.

18:04.991 --> 18:07.285
(Frasier speaks Spanish)

18:13.416 --> 18:15.460
(Marta translates in German)

18:20.256 --> 18:23.092
All right, fine,
you want to challenge me?

18:23.259 --> 18:25.303
En garde!

18:25.470 --> 18:28.598
That's just what we need,
a fourth language!

18:30.558 --> 18:32.810
You can't possibly fight this man.

18:32.977 --> 18:36.355
You forget.
I've been fencing since prep school.

18:36.522 --> 18:39.442
So what?
He was born with a sword in his hand.

18:39.609 --> 18:42.361
He probably performed
his own Caesarean.

18:45.573 --> 18:47.617
My God. He's going to kill me.

19:07.178 --> 19:09.930
Oh, very nice, very nice. Thank you.

20:01.189 --> 20:03.066
Niles!

20:04.526 --> 20:06.570
Are you all right?

20:08.196 --> 20:10.741
(Speaking German)

20:10.907 --> 20:13.535
Is he giving up?

20:15.078 --> 20:19.249
He wants you to apologise.
He didn't steal...your shoes.

20:27.674 --> 20:30.468
- My shoes?
- Yes, I'm sorry.

20:31.636 --> 20:34.264
Apparently, I mistranslated.

20:34.431 --> 20:38.685
He didn't mean... Not shoes, wife.

20:39.602 --> 20:41.646
(Speaks Spanish)

20:41.813 --> 20:43.732
(Translation in German)

20:46.067 --> 20:47.569
<i>Frau?</i>

20:48.903 --> 20:53.366
(Speaks German)

20:58.121 --> 21:00.498
(Marta translates in Spanish)

21:00.665 --> 21:04.752
He couldn't help it.
Maris is irresistible... Irresistible?!

21:05.879 --> 21:07.922
(Marta translates)

21:08.089 --> 21:09.757
OK.

21:14.804 --> 21:16.973
- But she refused him.
- Really?

21:25.231 --> 21:27.316
What did Maris say?

21:27.483 --> 21:29.527
(Marta translates)

21:33.823 --> 21:36.075
"l love Niles."

21:37.702 --> 21:40.329
Oh, she loves me.
My Maris is home.

21:41.998 --> 21:44.834
In five seconds,
tell him he's fired. Maris!

21:47.253 --> 21:50.256
lf only I could help
Gunnar and Gretchen.

21:52.633 --> 21:54.969
Tell him his wife loves him very much.

21:55.136 --> 21:59.223
(Frasier translates in Spanish)

21:59.390 --> 22:01.892
(Marta translates in German)

22:03.561 --> 22:06.480
No, no, not me, you! You!

22:06.647 --> 22:08.691
Marta, damn your pronoun problems!

22:08.858 --> 22:10.484
All right, you hapless wretch!

22:13.821 --> 22:19.326
# Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:19.493 --> 22:20.828
# Oh, my!

22:20.995 --> 22:27.960
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe...but I got you pegged!

22:28.127 --> 22:33.882
# But I don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:34.049 --> 22:36.051
# They're calling again #

22:36.218 --> 22:39.513
Frasier has left the building.
