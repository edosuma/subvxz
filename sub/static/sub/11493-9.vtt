Charlie Harper.

00:19.705 --> 00:20.838
Whoa. Look who's getting busy.

00:21.113 --> 00:22.581
Hey.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.801
He's acting like
my Uncle Charlie.

00:25.803 --> 00:28.253
He's even dressing
like my Uncle Charlie.

00:28.255 --> 00:30.255
People are really
worried about you.

00:30.257 --> 00:31.790
The only reason people
are worried about me

00:31.792 --> 00:34.259
is 'cause they can't wrap their
heads around how cool I am.

00:35.144 --> 00:37.229
- I'm fine.
- What's your name?

00:37.231 --> 00:39.965
- Charlie Harper.
- You're not fine.

00:39.967 --> 00:42.317
I've got a great idea.

00:42.319 --> 00:44.319
You and me, Vegas.

This doesn't look
like the Bellagio.

Uh, it's the, uh, back entrance.

00:47.608 --> 00:48.657
Hello, Mr. Harper.

00:48.659 --> 00:50.192
If you could,
just come with us.

00:50.194 --> 00:51.526
Uh, don't forget my bags.

00:51.528 --> 00:53.245
And we'll be going
to the presidential suite?

00:53.247 --> 00:54.496
Oh, yes, sir.

00:54.498 --> 00:57.199
Uh, I'm going to need
a bucket of ice,

00:57.201 --> 01:00.202
a bottle of scotch
and two Asian hookers.

01:00.204 --> 01:02.421

there was never any possibility

I mean, I've, uh,
learned a lot about myself

I now have the tools

01:53.424 --> 01:55.624
You know, a lot of people
say that,

01:55.626 --> 01:58.176

how another couple of weeks

it's a stress clinic.

About $2,500 a week.

is that I got a lot out of it.

03:16.182 --> 03:17.865
Well, that's good, 'cause
I've got something

03:17.867 --> 03:19.450
I want to talk
to you about.

03:19.452 --> 03:21.118
Oh, anything.
Dad's here for you, pal.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.403
Cool.

03:22.405 --> 03:23.854
So remember Megan?

03:23.856 --> 03:25.489
Oh, yeah, that was, uh,
your little girlfriend.

03:25.491 --> 03:26.908
Uh, she's seems
like a great gal.

03:26.910 --> 03:28.192
Well, I'm glad
you like her

03:28.194 --> 03:30.411
'cause she's
kind of pregnant.

03:32.998 --> 03:34.332
Kind of?

03:34.334 --> 03:35.750
She's not showing yet.

03:35.752 --> 03:37.919
She's still in
her first semester.

03:39.554 --> 03:40.972
Oh, my God.

03:40.974 --> 03:42.089
How-how...
how did this happen?

03:42.091 --> 03:44.141
I mean, what about
our talks about, uh,

03:44.143 --> 03:46.644
sexual responsibility
and-and using protection?

03:46.646 --> 03:48.262
I can explain that.

03:48.264 --> 03:49.430
Go ahead.

03:49.432 --> 03:51.148
I was drunk.

03:52.901 --> 03:55.236
Okay. Okay.

03:55.238 --> 03:57.154
I have the tools.

03:57.156 --> 04:00.358
And how do you propose
to take care of this child?

04:00.360 --> 04:01.692
Oh, we got that
figured out.

04:01.694 --> 04:03.894
First, we're going to
quit school and get jobs.

04:03.896 --> 04:05.613
Okay, stop right there.

04:05.615 --> 04:08.249
What jobs?

04:08.251 --> 04:10.567
Advertising-- we're going
to teach the baby to talk

04:10.569 --> 04:12.286
and put him
in E-Trade commercials.

04:13.121 --> 04:14.538
You're joking.

04:14.540 --> 04:18.175
No. We figure the baby they got
is probably getting pretty old.

04:23.382 --> 04:25.049
What does your mother
think about this?

04:25.051 --> 04:26.917
- She doesn't know.
- What?

04:26.919 --> 04:28.352
I was hoping
you'd tell her.

04:28.354 --> 04:30.021
Why do I have to tell her?

04:30.023 --> 04:31.188
Because she already hates you

04:31.190 --> 04:33.307
and she scares the crap
out of me.

04:38.313 --> 04:41.582
Hey, there he is.

04:41.584 --> 04:43.534
Welcome home, buddy.

04:45.537 --> 04:47.455
Thank you.
I'm glad to be here.

04:47.457 --> 04:48.739
Yeah. How you feeling?

04:48.741 --> 04:50.541
Fine. Why are you
whispering?

04:50.543 --> 04:52.543
Oh, I don't want
to startle you.

04:52.545 --> 04:54.578
Walden, I'm okay.

04:54.580 --> 04:56.280
Yeah, sure you are.

04:56.282 --> 04:57.832
Hey, Walden,
guess what.

04:57.834 --> 04:59.583
I'm going to be a dad.

05:01.853 --> 05:03.804
Really?

05:04.690 --> 05:06.924
Wow.

05:07.959 --> 05:09.927
How you feel about
that, Grandpa?

05:11.680 --> 05:14.131
Well, it's, uh, not something
I would have chosen

05:14.133 --> 05:16.233
for him at this stage
of his life,

05:16.235 --> 05:18.819
but he will continue
to have my love and support.

05:18.821 --> 05:22.189
If it's a boy,
we're going to name him Frodo.

05:23.025 --> 05:24.942
You're not making it
easy for me, pal.

05:25.994 --> 05:28.529
You should have
used a condom.

05:28.531 --> 05:31.198
Or you should have.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.868
Hey, look who's back
from the loony bin.

05:33.870 --> 05:36.587
It wasn't a loony bin;
it's a stress clinic.

05:36.589 --> 05:39.156
Did they let you
keep your belt?

05:39.158 --> 05:40.674
Uh, well...
Loony bin.

05:40.676 --> 05:42.793
- There's your mail.
- Thank you.

I'm going to be a dad.

05:46.999 --> 05:48.665
What's funny?

05:48.667 --> 05:50.935
From where you're
standing, nothing.

05:53.388 --> 05:55.022
Did you tell
him your news?

05:55.024 --> 05:56.524
Mmm, it'll keep.

05:56.526 --> 05:57.775
Hey, open your mail.

05:57.777 --> 05:59.693
Okay. Let's see.

05:59.695 --> 06:01.645
Uh, bill, bill, jury duty,

06:01.647 --> 06:02.863
bill.

06:02.865 --> 06:04.014
Ooh! Oh, here we go.

06:04.016 --> 06:05.116
My refund from the IRS.

06:05.118 --> 06:06.233
Ooh.
Whew!

06:06.235 --> 06:08.369
Just in time
what with all these bills.

06:08.371 --> 06:10.738
Might want to set some of that
aside for Frodo's headshots.

06:15.293 --> 06:16.460
Huh.

06:16.462 --> 06:18.695
It's not a refund at all.

06:18.697 --> 06:20.247
I'm being audited.

06:24.636 --> 06:25.586
What's so funny?

06:25.588 --> 06:27.838
From where you're
standing, nothing.

06:32.344 --> 06:33.477
I guess you're
probably wondering

06:33.479 --> 06:35.212
why I asked you guys
to come over.

06:35.214 --> 06:36.480
We understand, Alan.

06:36.482 --> 06:39.383
Mental illness is nothing
to be ashamed of.

06:39.385 --> 06:40.684
I'm not mentally ill.

06:40.686 --> 06:42.219
It was a stress clinic.

06:42.221 --> 06:44.905
Did the door lock from the
inside or the outside?

06:44.907 --> 06:46.390
Uh, uh, well, the... the...

06:49.778 --> 06:52.696
Nevertheless, the reason
I called a family meeting

06:52.698 --> 06:54.031
is because, uh, Jake

06:54.033 --> 06:56.250
and Megan
have some news.

06:56.252 --> 06:57.785
Oh, my God.
She's pregnant.

06:57.787 --> 06:59.086
Well, that was easy.

06:59.088 --> 07:00.621
Who wants cake?

07:00.623 --> 07:02.506
How could you do this?

07:02.508 --> 07:04.542
She made me.

07:04.544 --> 07:05.626
What?

07:05.628 --> 07:06.877
Oh, come on.

07:06.879 --> 07:08.762
Between the two of us,
who was a virgin?

07:08.764 --> 07:10.414
Okay, okay.

07:10.416 --> 07:11.432
What's done is done,

07:11.434 --> 07:13.384
but if we can come
together as a family,

07:13.386 --> 07:14.918
we can deal with this
without finger-pointing.

07:14.920 --> 07:15.936
Your father's right.

07:15.938 --> 07:17.888
Let's just calm down
and talk it through.

07:17.890 --> 07:21.142
Is it just me,
or does Herb and Judith's kid

07:21.144 --> 07:23.277
look a lot like Alan?

07:24.762 --> 07:28.315
Well, you know,
there is a slight resemblance.

07:28.317 --> 07:30.284
- Damn it, Jake!
- What the hell is wrong with you?

07:30.286 --> 07:31.652
How could you be
so irresponsible?

07:31.654 --> 07:33.204
I mean, what were you thinking?
What were you thinking?

07:33.206 --> 07:35.122
Did we raise you not to know
any better than this?

07:35.124 --> 07:36.657
What do you have
to say for yourself?

07:36.659 --> 07:38.459
When are you going
to tell him your news?

07:38.461 --> 07:40.794
Ah, I don't want to
make things worse.

07:40.796 --> 07:45.282
See, that's the big difference
between you and me.

07:45.284 --> 07:47.384
And you're a
grandpa now.

07:47.386 --> 07:48.952
Grandpa. Grandpa.

07:48.954 --> 07:50.954
<i>A grandpa and grandma...</i>

07:53.758 --> 07:54.958
Hey.

07:54.960 --> 07:56.594
Hey. How'd
your audit go?

07:56.596 --> 07:58.646
It wasn't so much an audit

07:58.648 --> 08:02.066
as a brutal prison rape
with a number two pencil.

08:02.068 --> 08:03.567
I'm confused.

08:03.569 --> 08:05.569
Did you like it or not?

08:05.571 --> 08:08.606
They say I owe them $80,000.

08:08.608 --> 08:10.324
So not.

08:10.326 --> 08:12.526
But the good news is,
if they take

08:12.528 --> 08:14.612
everything I own,
they'll only get four.

08:14.614 --> 08:15.613
$4,000?

08:15.615 --> 08:17.331
Four dollars.

08:17.333 --> 08:18.782
But I'm not worried.

08:18.784 --> 08:22.253
Because I have the tools to cope
with whatever life throws at me.

08:23.088 --> 08:25.089
No, you don't.

08:25.091 --> 08:26.924
Alan?

08:26.926 --> 08:28.325
Oh, Lyndsey.

08:28.327 --> 08:30.794
Sweetheart,
are you a sight for sore eyes.

08:30.796 --> 08:33.464
Yeah, it's good to see you, too.

Hey, Walden, I think now's
the time to tell him.

08:43.308 --> 08:45.142

20:05.978 --> 20:07.176
Oh, sure, it is.

20:07.178 --> 20:09.012
No, let me finish.

20:09.014 --> 20:11.281
I had a lot of time
to think while I was away.

20:11.283 --> 20:14.484
At least after I came off
the thorazine.

20:14.486 --> 20:18.455
And I realized that it's one
thing to live off my brother,

20:18.457 --> 20:20.991
but he's gone and...

20:20.993 --> 20:23.860
now his stuff's gone, too.

20:23.862 --> 20:28.748
I really don't belong
here anymore.

20:28.750 --> 20:29.966
So you're moving out?

20:29.968 --> 20:32.168
Oh, no, no! God, no!

20:32.170 --> 20:35.204
I mean, look at
the size of this thing.

20:35.206 --> 20:37.090
No, I just want
you to know that

20:37.092 --> 20:39.392
I'm aware of the
absurdity of our situation.

20:39.394 --> 20:41.311
Bring it in.
Oh...

20:43.647 --> 20:45.515
Computer, music on.

20:45.517 --> 20:48.851
♪ And I will always
love you... ♪

20:50.801 --> 20:52.383
