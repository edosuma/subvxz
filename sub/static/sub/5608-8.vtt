08:52.527 --> 08:54.594
We're gonna speak
for the voiceless.

08:54.596 --> 08:58.297
The victims of his martial law
and his racial profiling.

08:58.299 --> 09:01.000
You speak for victims
of racial profiling?

09:01.002 --> 09:03.603
Get profiled a lot, do you?

09:03.605 --> 09:05.571
Hey, little sister,
look around you.

09:05.573 --> 09:07.840
This city is ground zero
for uncontrolled policing.

09:07.842 --> 09:09.709
Come on.

09:09.711 --> 09:10.943
That's right.

09:10.945 --> 09:13.246
Lead, follow,

09:13.248 --> 09:16.015
or get out of the way.

09:22.356 --> 09:25.024
♪ ♪

09:30.564 --> 09:32.665
I know. I agree.

09:32.667 --> 09:34.767
There's nothing more important
than our marriage.

09:34.769 --> 09:37.937
Okay, but then why did you
rush out of there today?

09:37.939 --> 09:39.705
It won't happen again,
okay, Linda?

09:39.707 --> 09:40.873
LINDA: I'm not mad.

09:40.875 --> 09:42.208
I just...

09:42.210 --> 09:44.810
I just really want you
to talk to her.

09:44.812 --> 09:45.912
I know.

09:45.914 --> 09:47.180
I love you.

09:47.182 --> 09:48.347
I love you, too.

09:48.349 --> 09:49.582
I'll see you later.

09:49.584 --> 09:51.284
I'll call you on my way home.

09:52.920 --> 09:55.488
Everything okay?

09:55.490 --> 09:56.956
Nothing is.

09:56.958 --> 09:58.558
Got the autopsy results?

09:58.560 --> 10:01.394
M.E. confirmed
it's Danielle Levine.

10:01.396 --> 10:03.696
(sighs)

10:03.698 --> 10:06.465
Cause of death,
blunt force trauma to the head,

10:06.467 --> 10:08.301
which opened an old wound.

10:08.303 --> 10:09.702
The M.E. also said

10:09.704 --> 10:11.137
she was manually strangled.

10:11.139 --> 10:13.072
There are scratches here.

10:13.074 --> 10:15.174
M.E. says they're
from Danielle's own nails

10:15.176 --> 10:17.677
as she tried to pry his hands
from around her neck.

10:18.512 --> 10:20.346
Any evidence, DNA?

10:20.348 --> 10:22.982
Skin samples from
under her nails

10:22.984 --> 10:24.417
matched Thomas Wilder.

10:24.419 --> 10:25.918
(sighs)

10:27.187 --> 10:30.056
It's no coincidence the one girl
we talk to ends up dead.

10:30.058 --> 10:32.992
How would he know
we talked to her?

10:32.994 --> 10:35.661
DANNY: 'Cause he's not like
the other perps we deal with.

10:35.663 --> 10:37.730
He's always one
step ahead of us.

10:37.732 --> 10:39.999
BAEZ:
At least we know who he is.

10:41.468 --> 10:43.336
And what he is.

10:46.974 --> 10:48.441
(door opens)

10:48.443 --> 10:50.042
Sir, I have an unexpected
visitor for you.

10:50.044 --> 10:52.278
Then schedule it
at another time.

10:52.280 --> 10:54.880
No can do, sir.

10:54.882 --> 10:56.582
I need to talk to you.

10:56.584 --> 10:58.184
Hey.

10:59.286 --> 11:01.120
Well, at least sit down.

11:04.625 --> 11:06.626
Forgot what it was like
coming up to Fort Knox,

11:06.628 --> 11:08.227
getting up here to see you.

11:08.229 --> 11:10.329
Well, if you promise
to come by more often,

11:10.331 --> 11:12.565
I'll give you the E-Z Pass.

11:17.037 --> 11:19.605
Okay, what's up?

11:19.607 --> 11:22.642
I don't think you should
come up to school.

11:24.411 --> 11:25.811
Because?

11:25.813 --> 11:27.546
It's practically a trap.

11:27.548 --> 11:29.115
I'll bring backup.

11:29.117 --> 11:30.483
Please, I'm not joking.

11:30.485 --> 11:32.852
I know you're not,
but I have to.

11:32.854 --> 11:33.953
Why?

11:33.955 --> 11:36.255
When my granddaughter
has to come here

11:36.257 --> 11:39.425
and warn me off of speaking
at such a fine college

11:39.427 --> 11:43.462
because a few students
don't like the NYPD,

11:43.464 --> 11:47.066
that's a sad day,
and sad days need jokes.

11:47.068 --> 11:48.801
Would you listen to me?!

11:49.770 --> 11:51.604
Always.

11:51.606 --> 11:52.838
You don't understand.

11:52.840 --> 11:55.741
Some of my classmates think
the NYPD is racist.

11:57.544 --> 11:59.578
How many of these classmates?

11:59.580 --> 12:02.982
Enough of them, certainly
the ones that'll likely show up.

12:02.984 --> 12:04.216
But it's not the truth.

12:04.218 --> 12:05.551
Well, I know that
and you know that,

12:05.553 --> 12:09.221
but the atmosphere there, it...

12:09.223 --> 12:11.424
Is intolerant.

12:11.426 --> 12:13.726
Some of the groups
are incredibly tolerant

12:13.728 --> 12:16.796
and inclusive of a...
a whole wide range of things.

12:16.798 --> 12:19.165
But... it's like
an approved list,

12:19.167 --> 12:22.368
and if you're not on it,
then you got to watch out.

12:22.370 --> 12:24.904
Must be tough on you.

12:24.906 --> 12:26.839
Actually, I can see it
for what it is.

12:26.841 --> 12:30.109
I mean... I kind of
grew up around it.

12:30.111 --> 12:31.210
How's that?

12:31.212 --> 12:32.678
Grandpa, I've been
at Reagan dinner tables

12:32.680 --> 12:34.046
since I was in a high chair.

12:34.048 --> 12:35.348
I mean, the Reagans have

12:35.350 --> 12:38.417
a pretty strong set
of doctrines themselves.

12:38.419 --> 12:39.785
Are you saying we're intolerant?

12:39.787 --> 12:44.123
Not at all, but...
highly opinionated.

12:44.125 --> 12:48.094
Okay, but isn't college
supposed to be a place

12:48.096 --> 12:50.396
where divergent
opinions can clash

12:50.398 --> 12:53.566
without fear of reprisal,
with impunity?

12:53.568 --> 12:55.501
Maybe it's <i>supposed</i>
to be, but...

12:55.503 --> 12:57.870
Look, I'm used to "not fair."

12:57.872 --> 12:59.405
It's a big part of this job.

12:59.407 --> 13:01.240
Please, would you just
trust me on this?

13:01.242 --> 13:03.676
I'm telling you, it's-it's
gonna make you look bad.

13:06.513 --> 13:08.647
I'm used to that, too.

13:23.497 --> 13:27.066
Even with all the high-tech
plate readers and cameras,

13:27.068 --> 13:29.201
it's hard to believe we
haven't gotten a hit on him.

13:29.203 --> 13:31.237
Hello?

13:31.239 --> 13:34.140
You know, maybe... maybe we got
to work on a smaller scale.

13:34.142 --> 13:36.475
Known associates,
family members.

13:36.477 --> 13:38.244
No, this guy's a loner,

13:38.246 --> 13:41.147
except for one person:
his mother.

13:41.149 --> 13:42.481
Yeah, we tried that already.

13:42.483 --> 13:44.116
She was in rehab.

13:44.118 --> 13:47.987
She was doing a 30-day stint,
which ended about five days ago.

13:47.989 --> 13:49.321
Why don't we take a ride?

13:49.323 --> 13:51.624
Yeah, what makes you
think she'll talk to us?

13:51.626 --> 13:53.292
My winning personality.

13:54.961 --> 13:56.796
Come on, it's worth a shot.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.168
I knocked this time.

14:02.170 --> 14:04.170
You're supposed to knock first.

14:04.172 --> 14:07.473
Oh, that's right.

14:07.475 --> 14:09.175
Mmm, not even a smile, huh?

14:09.177 --> 14:10.509
You still angry?

14:10.511 --> 14:14.079
He could have got us killed,
rushing in there like that.

14:14.081 --> 14:17.216
Yeah, and it's over now,
and none of us got hurt.

14:17.218 --> 14:18.884
This time.

14:18.886 --> 14:21.120
And that's just
pure luck, not strategy.

14:21.122 --> 14:22.788
And you told him
off about it too.

14:22.790 --> 14:25.858
Now let's move
on, Norma Rae.

14:25.860 --> 14:27.426
What's that supposed to mean?

14:27.428 --> 14:29.428
It means sometimes
people think things,

14:29.430 --> 14:30.729
and there are times

14:30.731 --> 14:32.565
when you should keep
those things to yourself.

14:32.567 --> 14:34.433
Not when lives are at stake.

14:34.435 --> 14:36.936
He outranks you.
And?

14:36.938 --> 14:38.270
Well, maybe that doesn't
matter to you,

14:38.272 --> 14:39.505
but that matters to me.

14:39.507 --> 14:41.040
I didn't bring you
into this, Eddie.

14:41.042 --> 14:42.608
We are partners, Jamie,

14:42.610 --> 14:44.543
so anything that you do
also affects me.

14:44.545 --> 14:45.778
So now you're saying you think
I make you look bad.

14:45.802 --> 14:46.680
No.

14:46.681 --> 14:48.047
You don't like
the way I do things,

14:48.049 --> 14:49.215
ride with someone else, Eddie.

14:49.217 --> 14:50.977
Ride with someone
who keeps their mouth shut.

15:02.028 --> 15:03.996
(knocking on door)

15:03.998 --> 15:07.333
BAEZ: NYPD detectives, we're
looking for Shelly Wilder.

15:07.335 --> 15:09.034
WOMAN: What
do you want?

15:11.671 --> 15:13.606
NYPD.

15:13.608 --> 15:16.008
Hoping to ask you a few
questions about your son.

15:16.010 --> 15:17.443
We're not looking
for any trouble.

15:17.445 --> 15:19.812
Good. I don't like trouble.

15:21.314 --> 15:23.182
We don't like
trouble either.

15:27.521 --> 15:29.755
You know why we're looking
for your son, ma'am?

15:29.757 --> 15:31.557
Cops say he killed
some girls.

15:31.559 --> 15:32.791
Five girls.

15:32.793 --> 15:35.160
That we know of.

15:36.663 --> 15:39.298
Why don't I
help you with that?

15:39.300 --> 15:41.967
Okay.

15:41.969 --> 15:44.737
Yeah, he, uh...

15:44.739 --> 15:46.672
hit them with a hammer,

15:46.674 --> 15:49.341
strangled them and
desecrated their bodies.

15:49.343 --> 15:52.344
That boy was always
messing with dead things.

15:53.480 --> 15:54.446
How's that?

15:54.448 --> 15:55.648
He used to capture

15:55.650 --> 15:56.982
little animals,

15:56.984 --> 15:58.217
and he'd chop
off their heads,

15:58.219 --> 16:00.286
or, you know,
stab 'em to death.

16:00.288 --> 16:02.955
and then he'd put 'em
outside the house on sticks,

16:02.957 --> 16:04.924
sort of like lawn ornaments.

16:04.926 --> 16:08.394
And that, uh, never raised
any red flags with you, huh?

16:08.396 --> 16:10.829
WILDER: Not my fault
what happened to that boy.

16:10.831 --> 16:12.765
If I tried to protect him
from his daddy,

16:12.767 --> 16:15.334
I'd get beat up real bad,

16:15.336 --> 16:17.736
so I gave up trying
to help him.

16:17.738 --> 16:21.240
You know, it's not too late
for you to help him still.

16:24.544 --> 16:27.546
If you just told us
where he is,

16:27.548 --> 16:30.082
we could get him
all the help he needs.

16:35.121 --> 16:37.156
He called me.

16:37.158 --> 16:38.958
He did?

16:38.960 --> 16:42.561
He told me he was on the
front page of the paper.

16:42.563 --> 16:44.396
He was real proud of that.

16:44.398 --> 16:45.898
I bet he was.

16:45.900 --> 16:47.399
When did he call you?

16:47.401 --> 16:48.901
Three weeks ago.

16:48.903 --> 16:50.970
On your cell phone?

16:50.972 --> 16:54.239
Yeah, he said he had
to disappear for a while.

16:54.241 --> 16:55.841
Can I take that?

16:55.843 --> 16:57.843
(scoffs)
That's a little forward of me.

16:57.845 --> 16:58.844
Let me... let me...

16:58.846 --> 17:01.747
Can I borrow your phone?

17:01.749 --> 17:03.382
I won't go through
anything personal,

17:03.384 --> 17:06.452
I just, uh... bring it back
in a couple hours,

17:06.454 --> 17:09.121
and maybe...

17:09.123 --> 17:11.957
I'll come back
with one more of these.

17:16.796 --> 17:18.464
In that case...

17:21.300 --> 17:24.603
Just you make sure you
get Thomas some help.

17:24.605 --> 17:26.638
Okay.

17:26.641 --> 17:29.141
'Cause he really likes
to kill things.

17:55.027 --> 17:56.928
I know you know what
you're getting into.

17:56.930 --> 17:59.964
When I was a kid, there was
a genuine respect for cops.

17:59.966 --> 18:01.833
That's <i>you.</i>

18:01.835 --> 18:04.702
And where and
how <i>you</i> grew up.

18:04.704 --> 18:06.704
Oh, you didn't respect cops
when you were growing up?

18:06.706 --> 18:09.007
Sure, I did... in theory.

18:09.009 --> 18:12.343
But in practice, I never
interacted with them.

18:12.345 --> 18:14.679
Couple of speeding
tickets, that's it.

18:14.681 --> 18:16.448
Like the vast majority of
the people in this country.

18:16.450 --> 18:18.416
Well, at least you appreciated

18:18.418 --> 18:20.051
that they were there
if you needed them.

18:20.053 --> 18:22.020
Yes, but that's
not my point.

18:22.022 --> 18:24.656
The point is because most people
have no firsthand knowledge,

18:24.658 --> 18:27.725
no "Morning, Officer Krupke,"
in their daily life...

18:27.727 --> 18:30.895
Exactly, so the bad stories tend
to take a stronger hold,

18:30.897 --> 18:34.299
because people don't have good
experiences to compare 'em to.

18:34.301 --> 18:35.767
And I bet 90-odd percent

18:35.769 --> 18:38.636
of Nicky's classmates have had
no significant interaction

18:38.638 --> 18:39.871
with police officers.

18:39.873 --> 18:43.141
They're about to meet one.

18:43.143 --> 18:47.679
If a conservative is really just
a liberal who's been mugged,

18:47.681 --> 18:49.981
you could engineer
a crime spree instead.

18:49.983 --> 18:51.483
Garrett, I'm going.

18:51.485 --> 18:55.487
You could go, hear them out,
take their criticism,

18:55.489 --> 18:56.855
try to tell them your side,

18:56.857 --> 18:58.957
but you'd be defending
something that in your heart

18:58.959 --> 19:01.426
you believe
doesn't need defending,

19:01.428 --> 19:04.028
but praise instead.

19:04.830 --> 19:06.998
I have no idea
what you just said.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
You're reaching.

19:13.772 --> 19:17.142
Garrett, I'm worried...

19:17.144 --> 19:19.811
that Nicky coming here
wasn't about concern for me,

19:19.813 --> 19:22.247
but embarrassment
at what I might say.

19:22.249 --> 19:24.282
No, I don't buy that
for a second.

19:24.284 --> 19:28.753
Last time I talked to her class,
she was in the fourth grade.

19:28.755 --> 19:30.755
She sat in the front row.

19:30.757 --> 19:33.458
She was... beaming.

19:33.460 --> 19:36.561
Felt great.

19:37.396 --> 19:41.032
Maybe just savor that.

19:54.046 --> 19:55.513
We got anything
from TARU yet?

19:55.515 --> 19:56.748
They're working on it.

19:56.750 --> 19:58.283
They've been working
on it all night.

19:58.285 --> 20:00.485
Well, calling them about it
every five minutes is doing

20:00.487 --> 20:03.288
as much good as plying
Mrs. Wilder with alcohol.

20:03.290 --> 20:04.822
It worked, didn't it?

20:04.824 --> 20:07.458
She gave up the phone,
she gave up that he called.

20:07.460 --> 20:09.494
Danny, she was drunk.
Who cares?

20:09.496 --> 20:11.729
A defense attorney, when
you're on the stand testifying

20:11.731 --> 20:13.698
about how you got
Wilder's information.

20:13.700 --> 20:15.633
She's not even gonna remember.

20:17.803 --> 20:20.572
We got something.
What?

20:20.574 --> 20:23.875
The number Wilder called from
was a burner cell.

20:23.877 --> 20:26.244
Was it deactivated?

20:26.246 --> 20:29.347
According to TARU,
it's still on.

20:29.349 --> 20:31.182
Did they trace it?

20:31.184 --> 20:34.886
It's pinging off a tower
at West 147th Street.

20:34.888 --> 20:37.855
Let's go.

20:42.228 --> 20:43.695
Lieutenant.

20:43.697 --> 20:44.629
Hey, Officer Reagan.

20:44.631 --> 20:46.564
Why don't you have
a seat there?

20:50.869 --> 20:54.639
How you doing?

20:54.641 --> 20:55.873
Wondering why I'm here.

20:55.875 --> 20:58.243
You don't know why?

20:58.245 --> 20:59.777
This have something to do
with the commissioner?

20:59.779 --> 21:00.845
Nope, not at all.

21:00.847 --> 21:01.913
I called you in.

21:01.915 --> 21:03.548
This is about
the incident yesterday.

21:03.550 --> 21:04.682
That's right.

21:04.684 --> 21:07.585
You know you're entitled
to a PBA rep.

21:07.587 --> 21:09.153
I don't need a rep.

21:09.155 --> 21:10.722
Suit yourself.

21:10.724 --> 21:12.290
I want to know
about the altercation

21:12.292 --> 21:13.891
between you and Sergeant Mulvey.

21:13.893 --> 21:15.693
I already spoke to him.

21:15.695 --> 21:17.161
Really?
Mm-hmm.

21:17.163 --> 21:19.364
He had a mouthful
to say about you.

21:20.532 --> 21:21.933
One-- you pushed him.

21:21.935 --> 21:24.269
Two-- you disregarded
his orders.

21:24.271 --> 21:25.803
We arrived on the scene.

21:25.805 --> 21:27.572
An armed perp was inside,

21:27.574 --> 21:29.240
along with a 12-year-old girl.

21:29.242 --> 21:31.776
I wanted to request ESU and HNT,

21:31.778 --> 21:34.112
contain the perp inside
until they arrived.

21:34.114 --> 21:36.414
There was no reason to go
in there, guns blazing.

21:36.416 --> 21:37.315
But he's the sergeant.

21:37.317 --> 21:38.650
It was a textbook case

21:38.652 --> 21:39.884
for hostage negotiation.

21:39.886 --> 21:41.252
But you disobeyed orders.

21:41.254 --> 21:43.321
I asked him not to go in.

21:43.323 --> 21:46.424
He decided to go in anyway,
and so I went with him.

21:46.426 --> 21:48.693
And you pushed him.

21:48.695 --> 21:50.995
It might've gotten physical--

21:50.997 --> 21:52.330
"Might've gotten physical"?

21:52.332 --> 21:55.066
That was after
the whole thing was over.

21:57.269 --> 21:59.537
You would've done
something differently?

21:59.539 --> 22:01.372
As a uniform,

22:01.374 --> 22:04.242
I would've done
exactly what you did.

22:04.244 --> 22:07.512
But if I was Mulvey,

22:07.514 --> 22:11.349
I would've given you a rip
for insubordination.

22:27.766 --> 22:28.766
Hey.

22:29.134 --> 22:30.835
You work here?

22:30.837 --> 22:32.036
I'm the super.

22:32.038 --> 22:33.938
We're looking
for Thomas Wilder.

22:33.940 --> 22:35.940
Never heard of him.
You sure?

22:35.942 --> 22:38.076
We got no one by that name.

22:38.078 --> 22:39.444
He would've moved in
a couple months ago.

22:39.446 --> 22:40.678
Maybe he's visiting someone,
subletting?

22:40.680 --> 22:42.246
I told you
I never heard of the guy.

22:42.248 --> 22:44.949
Do you recognize this man?

22:44.951 --> 22:46.551
Oh, yeah!
That's Danny Reagan.

22:46.553 --> 22:47.819
Danny Reagan?

22:47.821 --> 22:49.020
Yeah, real nice guy.

22:49.022 --> 22:50.088
Perfect tenant.

22:50.090 --> 22:51.289
He pays in cash.

22:51.291 --> 22:52.357
And he's real quiet.

22:52.359 --> 22:53.958
Where can we find
this Danny Reagan?

22:53.960 --> 22:56.394
I think I saw him go in
about an hour ago.

22:56.396 --> 22:58.129
Okay, what floor?
4C.

22:58.131 --> 23:00.965
We need a key.
Yeah, but I-I just can't--

23:00.967 --> 23:02.834
Give me the key!

23:04.136 --> 23:05.703
Take the back.

23:05.705 --> 23:07.905
Be careful.

23:14.213 --> 23:16.414
(wings fluttering)

23:36.835 --> 23:40.104
♪ ♪

24:10.769 --> 24:12.370
It's all clear.

24:12.372 --> 24:13.938
Stand down.

24:13.940 --> 24:16.140
Copy that, partner.

24:17.376 --> 24:19.544
(phone ringing)

24:28.587 --> 24:29.620
Yeah?

24:29.622 --> 24:31.823
WILDER:
Hello again, Detective.

24:36.695 --> 24:39.230
Did you really think
I'd be stupid enough

24:39.232 --> 24:41.299
to stay in that apartment
long enough

24:41.301 --> 24:43.835
for you to find me?

24:47.039 --> 24:49.173
No... (panting)

24:49.175 --> 24:51.409
but I thought
you'd be man enough

24:51.411 --> 24:53.478
to come see me
face-to-face again.

24:53.480 --> 24:55.680
Attempts to make me feel
emasculated won't work,

24:55.682 --> 24:57.515
though I applaud the effort.

24:57.517 --> 25:00.518
Heard you spoke with my mom.

25:00.520 --> 25:03.421
I did.

25:03.423 --> 25:05.957
She said you're demented.

25:05.959 --> 25:09.026
Well, she should know.

25:09.028 --> 25:11.395
You do realize I'm gonna
find you, right?

25:11.397 --> 25:13.297
Too bad you didn't find me
in time to stop

25:13.299 --> 25:16.167
poor Danielle Levine
from meeting her end.

25:17.703 --> 25:19.403
She put up a good fight.

25:22.194 --> 25:24.462
Unlike you...

25:24.464 --> 25:26.731
when you didn't
put up a good fight

25:26.733 --> 25:28.433
against your old man
beating on you, huh?

25:28.435 --> 25:30.068
Stop! Shut up!

25:30.070 --> 25:32.236
I figure that's
why you like getting off

25:32.238 --> 25:36.274
on beating up
on poor defenseless women, huh?

25:36.276 --> 25:38.776
You've got a pretty wife.

25:40.479 --> 25:42.880
What did you say?

25:42.882 --> 25:45.183
She left this morning at 8:05.

25:45.185 --> 25:46.984
And your two boys,

25:46.986 --> 25:48.886
they left at 8:00.

25:48.888 --> 25:51.589
I will kill you, you hear me?

25:51.591 --> 25:53.091
I said I will kill you!

25:53.093 --> 25:56.694
You have a good day, Detective.

25:56.696 --> 25:57.695
Hey!

25:57.697 --> 26:00.031
(hangs up, dial tone drones)

26:11.965 --> 26:13.332
DANNY:
<i>Just gonna have them</i>

26:13.334 --> 26:15.801
<i>sit on the house</i>
<i>until I get this guy.</i>

26:15.803 --> 26:18.404
I'll have another car
around the block, okay?

26:18.756 --> 26:21.403
Just as a precaution,
nothing to worry about.

26:21.404 --> 26:23.237
The thing about
being married to you

26:23.239 --> 26:24.872
for 17 years is I know
when you're lying.

26:24.874 --> 26:26.808
I'm not lying,
I'm just being cautious.

26:26.810 --> 26:29.310
Well, that 17 years as a
cop's wife also tells me

26:29.312 --> 26:32.046
that there's no way that you
would have two radio cars

26:32.048 --> 26:34.916
24-7 outside, plus a police
escort for the boys,

26:34.918 --> 26:36.751
unless we were
in some real danger.

26:36.753 --> 26:39.520
You know me, I...
don't like to take chances.

26:39.522 --> 26:40.922
Not with you guys.

26:40.924 --> 26:43.157
No, just with yourself.

26:43.159 --> 26:44.325
There's nothing to worry about.

26:44.327 --> 26:46.427
Oh, nothing
to worry about?

26:46.429 --> 26:48.429
Now that I know that you're
trying to arrest a guy

26:48.431 --> 26:50.498
who's already killed
a half a dozen women?

26:50.500 --> 26:54.135
A guy who's brazen, he-he calls
you at work just to taunt you?

26:54.137 --> 26:56.971
Come on, it's not like
he's a mastermind or something.

26:56.973 --> 26:58.439
He's just a perp.

26:58.441 --> 27:00.274
He sounds like
a mastermind to me.

27:00.276 --> 27:01.242
Well, I'm gonna get him.

27:01.244 --> 27:03.444
At what cost, Danny?

27:07.950 --> 27:09.750
The thing about this,
there were no fatalities,

27:09.752 --> 27:11.285
no serious injuries.

27:11.287 --> 27:12.353
No, sir.

27:12.355 --> 27:14.422
But... that's
despite your actions,

27:14.424 --> 27:16.591
not because of them.
Sir?

27:16.593 --> 27:18.192
Normally, you have
a scene like this,

27:18.194 --> 27:20.962
with an armed perp barricaded
in a house with a hostage,

27:20.964 --> 27:23.831
it's a textbook case
to call ESU and HNT

27:23.833 --> 27:26.334
and just sit tight
until they get there.

27:26.336 --> 27:27.568
I thought trying
to rescue the girl

27:27.570 --> 27:29.070
was the most important thing.

27:29.072 --> 27:30.938
But something's been bugging me
about that because you

27:30.940 --> 27:32.974
actually put her in more danger
barging in there like that.

27:32.976 --> 27:34.108
Take a seat.

27:34.110 --> 27:35.276
This is ridiculous.

27:35.278 --> 27:36.244
Believe me,

27:36.246 --> 27:38.412
there's times to break rules,

27:38.414 --> 27:40.448
but I don't think
this was one of them.

27:40.450 --> 27:41.616
Am I being disciplined here?

27:41.618 --> 27:42.950
You know what,
to tell you the truth,

27:42.952 --> 27:44.151
I'm wondering
why you didn't serve

27:44.153 --> 27:45.887
Officer Reagan with
a charge for insubordination.

27:45.889 --> 27:48.422
I don't understand.

27:48.424 --> 27:50.458
He disobeyed a direct order.

27:50.460 --> 27:52.126
I would've raked him
over the coals.

27:52.128 --> 27:54.295
But you didn't even issue
a command discipline-- why not?

27:54.297 --> 27:55.663
He's the commissioner's son.

27:55.665 --> 27:57.231
Ah, I don't believe
that's the reason.

27:57.233 --> 27:58.466
Why's that?

27:58.468 --> 28:00.801
Last month, you subdued
an EDP with a knife.

28:00.803 --> 28:02.870
Eight months ago,
you jumped

28:02.872 --> 28:04.906
onto the subway tracks
after an intoxicated rider

28:04.908 --> 28:07.408
fell onto the tracks.

28:07.410 --> 28:10.044
Six months ago, you were
the first on the scene

28:10.046 --> 28:11.779
of an armed robbery
that wasn't even

28:11.781 --> 28:13.915
within the confines
of your precinct.

28:13.917 --> 28:14.982
I saved lives.

28:14.984 --> 28:16.350
At the risk
of other people's lives,

28:16.352 --> 28:18.252
including your own!

28:18.254 --> 28:19.887
Five times
in 12 months!

28:19.889 --> 28:21.555
I'll tell you,
it reads like a death wish.

28:21.557 --> 28:23.457
I'm not gonna sit here
and apologize

28:23.459 --> 28:25.126
for being a proactive cop!

28:25.128 --> 28:26.894
If I didn't know better,
I'd say it looks

28:26.896 --> 28:28.663
like you're trying to get
yourself killed.

28:33.235 --> 28:35.536
I got a newspaper photo
of you from six months ago.

28:35.538 --> 28:37.905
Looks like you lost 40 pounds.

28:37.907 --> 28:39.840
With all due respect, sir,

28:39.842 --> 28:41.809
I have a spotless record.

28:41.811 --> 28:43.177
Cut the BS.

28:43.179 --> 28:44.345
This isn't about
your record.

28:44.347 --> 28:46.013
All right?
Now what's going on?

28:46.015 --> 28:47.949
You taking drugs?

28:47.951 --> 28:50.151
I can have you tested.

28:52.020 --> 28:54.622
Uh...

28:54.624 --> 28:56.791
I, uh...

28:59.695 --> 29:02.997
I have pancreatic cancer.

29:08.003 --> 29:11.138
I got six months to live.

29:11.140 --> 29:13.474
And you got
ten years on the job,

29:13.476 --> 29:17.244
which means if you die, your
family has no health benefits.

29:17.246 --> 29:19.313
If I get killed
in the line of duty,

29:19.315 --> 29:21.048
they'll be better taken care of.

29:21.050 --> 29:23.517
They'll...

29:23.519 --> 29:25.553
they'll get a lump sum.

29:25.555 --> 29:27.788
And you'll die a hero.

29:27.790 --> 29:31.058
It's a win-win.

29:31.060 --> 29:34.195
You know, I feel for you.

29:34.197 --> 29:37.064
But you know I can't
let you put lives at risk.

29:37.066 --> 29:39.200
Sir...

29:39.202 --> 29:40.735
no, you can't do this to me.

29:40.737 --> 29:42.436
No, no, no, no, I got
to take you off the street.

29:42.438 --> 29:44.705
No, look, I-I wasn't trying
to put anyone in danger.

29:44.707 --> 29:46.140
Okay? Look...

29:46.142 --> 29:48.042
look at me.

29:48.044 --> 29:51.612
I... I'm doing this
for my family, okay?

29:51.614 --> 29:53.014
Yeah.

29:53.016 --> 29:55.182
I know.

30:01.923 --> 30:03.924
(siren whoops, car horn beeps)

30:04.993 --> 30:07.661
Okay, when?

30:07.663 --> 30:10.164
Yeah?

30:10.166 --> 30:11.866
All right, got it.

30:11.868 --> 30:13.634
Thank you.
Hey, I got something.

30:14.603 --> 30:16.303
Wilder used my name
to rent an apartment, right?

30:16.305 --> 30:17.471
Yeah.

30:17.473 --> 30:18.606
So I figured maybe that scumbag

30:18.608 --> 30:20.241
used my name
for something else.

30:20.243 --> 30:22.109
So I ran Daniel Reagan through
every major credit card company.

30:22.111 --> 30:23.144
I got a hit.

30:23.146 --> 30:24.545
Where?

30:24.547 --> 30:25.613
Manhattan Boat Rentals.

30:25.615 --> 30:28.082
This maniac used my name
to rent a boat.

30:28.084 --> 30:29.150
Do we know where it's docked?

30:29.152 --> 30:30.985
West Side Marina.
Let's go.

30:41.997 --> 30:43.030
You ready?

30:43.032 --> 30:46.500
Pretty much.

30:46.502 --> 30:48.436
Teddy won't be there
to help you.

30:48.438 --> 30:51.205
How do you know?

30:51.207 --> 30:53.140
The more I think about it,

30:53.142 --> 30:55.676
the more I think it is
an epically bad idea.

30:55.678 --> 30:57.344
I'm not arguing.

30:57.346 --> 30:58.612
Then why are you going?

30:58.614 --> 31:00.081
Because I said I would.

31:00.083 --> 31:01.749
You can do better than that.

31:01.751 --> 31:04.018
I don't have
to do better than that.

31:04.953 --> 31:07.288
Garrett, I know what
I'm getting into.

31:07.290 --> 31:09.423
This isn't my first rodeo.

31:11.193 --> 31:14.395
But someone has
to tell our side.

31:14.397 --> 31:18.399
I have to try.

31:18.401 --> 31:20.668
Let somebody else do it.

31:20.670 --> 31:22.069
You're the PC.

31:22.071 --> 31:23.337
Something came up.

31:23.339 --> 31:26.073
It's not hard to find
a bulletproof excuse.

31:26.075 --> 31:27.074
No.

31:27.076 --> 31:28.909
To what end?

31:31.179 --> 31:32.279
Nicky.

31:32.281 --> 31:34.949
Nicky asked you to cancel.

31:34.951 --> 31:37.184
Uh, begged, you said.

31:38.053 --> 31:40.588
I know.

31:40.590 --> 31:41.755
Just between us?

31:41.757 --> 31:44.024
Sure.

31:45.360 --> 31:47.294
She pretty much grew up

31:47.296 --> 31:49.163
without her father present,

31:49.165 --> 31:52.867
and I've been the closest thing
to it in her life.

31:52.869 --> 31:56.303
I won't have the opportunity,
many more times,

31:56.305 --> 32:00.307
to show by example
instead of by anecdote.

32:00.309 --> 32:02.476
So I'm taking it.

32:07.415 --> 32:08.782
Shall we?

32:10.318 --> 32:12.586
I guess we shall.

32:12.588 --> 32:15.055
Thank you.

32:17.125 --> 32:18.959
I think that's it,

32:18.961 --> 32:20.761
with the blue
and white flag.

32:20.763 --> 32:22.163
Careful.

32:22.165 --> 32:23.664
Come on.

32:38.813 --> 32:40.681
It looks like there's
someone on board.

32:42.651 --> 32:45.219
Call it in.

32:45.221 --> 32:46.921
5-4 detectives
to Central

32:46.923 --> 32:49.757
requesting a 10-85
at the West Side Marina.

32:49.759 --> 32:50.891
Also have Harbor Patrol

32:50.893 --> 32:53.327
and ESU respond
to this location.

32:53.329 --> 32:55.629
(boat engine starts)

32:57.232 --> 32:58.666
Come on. I'm not waiting.

32:58.668 --> 33:00.834
We know what he's capable of.
We have to wait for backup.

33:00.836 --> 33:02.002
You're my backup.

33:04.873 --> 33:08.943
It's still tethered
to the dock.

33:08.945 --> 33:12.179
(classical music playing)

33:38.914 --> 33:41.282
(police boat engine rumbling)

33:41.284 --> 33:43.784
Hey. You got anything?

33:43.786 --> 33:45.253
It's gonna take
a couple of weeks.

33:45.255 --> 33:46.887
You're kidding me.
What do you want me to tell you?

33:46.889 --> 33:48.322
BAEZ: It looked like there was
someone on board.

33:48.324 --> 33:49.657
There are human remains evident.

33:49.659 --> 33:52.026
Whether they belong
to Thomas Wilder, I don't know.

33:52.028 --> 33:53.661
You can do better
than that for us.

33:53.663 --> 33:54.629
I wish I could.

33:54.631 --> 33:56.664
Look, just take
an educated guess.

33:56.666 --> 33:58.566
Reagan, all I have
are bone fragments.

33:58.568 --> 34:00.101
I don't even know
if they're male or female.

34:00.103 --> 34:02.003
(sighs) Believe me, I know
how important it is

34:02.005 --> 34:03.104
for you to get this guy.

34:03.106 --> 34:04.772
I just can't help you
right now.

34:04.774 --> 34:06.474
All right. Thanks.

34:11.880 --> 34:13.080
(knocking)

34:14.850 --> 34:15.882
I don't know why you even knock.

34:15.885 --> 34:18.686
Because you asked me to.

34:18.688 --> 34:20.187
You know, it's the whole
give and take thing

34:20.188 --> 34:21.755
in a partnership.

34:21.757 --> 34:23.056
Right.

34:23.059 --> 34:25.092
As long as you don't disagree
with your partner.

34:25.094 --> 34:28.496
I get the reason
that you mouthed off.

34:28.498 --> 34:29.496
I should know.

34:29.498 --> 34:30.731
I do it all the time,

34:30.733 --> 34:32.199
just not to superior officers.

34:32.201 --> 34:34.635
Same call tomorrow,
I'd do the exact same thing.

34:34.637 --> 34:36.404
I understand that.

34:36.406 --> 34:38.371
And part of me is
even a little jealous

34:38.373 --> 34:40.708
that you don't think twice about
challenging everyone,

34:40.710 --> 34:42.877
including someone
that can give you a rip.

34:42.879 --> 34:44.245
I hate to tell you this,

34:44.246 --> 34:45.713
but you're no shrinking violet.

34:45.715 --> 34:47.648
(scoffs)

34:47.650 --> 34:48.983
You know, I fight the urge

34:48.985 --> 34:50.818
to say what I'm really
thinking to bosses.

34:50.820 --> 34:52.652
That's good;
you'll never be suspended.

34:54.289 --> 34:56.023
You want to know
what's really bugging me?

34:56.025 --> 34:58.626
It's not that you got into
a fight with the boss.

34:58.628 --> 35:00.728
It's that the reason
that I don't do

35:00.730 --> 35:02.697
things like that
isn't because...

35:02.699 --> 35:05.066
I'm afraid
of getting in trouble...

35:05.068 --> 35:07.268
it's because of my dad.

35:07.270 --> 35:09.837
You know, in the back of
my head, I'm always thinking

35:09.839 --> 35:12.573
that someone's just gonna say,

35:12.575 --> 35:14.642
"What do you know?
Your dad's a criminal."

35:16.645 --> 35:18.546
Well, my dad's the pre-eminent
police authority,

35:18.548 --> 35:22.450
so back of my head, I'm always
afraid they're gonna say

35:22.452 --> 35:24.452
"He's the commissioner's son,
he thinks he's entitled."

35:24.454 --> 35:26.954
Well, I don't know anyone

35:26.956 --> 35:28.723
that knows you or your dad
that thinks that.

35:28.725 --> 35:29.957
Whatever.

35:29.959 --> 35:31.392
It doesn't matter.

35:31.394 --> 35:33.427
Gotta say what I think.

35:33.429 --> 35:34.395
I'd do it again.

35:34.397 --> 35:35.796
Well, fine by me.

35:35.798 --> 35:38.265
But would you please
stop accusing me

35:38.267 --> 35:39.367
of wanting a new partner

35:39.369 --> 35:41.402
just because I give you
a little bit of grief?

35:41.404 --> 35:42.470
I was just
trying to...

35:42.472 --> 35:43.437
Mouthing off?

35:43.439 --> 35:44.739
...set it straight.

35:44.741 --> 35:46.374
Besides, you're the one
that called me Norma Rae.

35:46.376 --> 35:49.143
In future, if you're gonna
compare me to a movie star,

35:49.145 --> 35:50.611
I'd rather it not
be Sally Field.

35:50.613 --> 35:52.246
I like to think of myself

35:52.248 --> 35:54.115
as a little bit more of
a Clint Eastwood type of guy.

35:54.117 --> 35:56.917
Okay, Clint.

35:56.919 --> 35:58.619
There's a happy hour
at Sullivan's.

35:58.621 --> 36:00.654
Want to buy me a drink?

36:00.656 --> 36:02.256
Go ahead, make my day.

36:02.258 --> 36:04.258
Yeah, well,
you can go ahead

36:04.260 --> 36:07.194
and admit that
I turned out to be right.

36:07.196 --> 36:08.896
Oh, you feeling
lucky, punk?

36:08.898 --> 36:10.798
(laughing):
You're such a jerk.

36:15.203 --> 36:18.139
(indistinct chatter)

36:18.141 --> 36:21.075
If everyone could
settle down, please.

36:21.077 --> 36:23.244
It is my honor to introduce

36:23.246 --> 36:25.646
Commissioner Reagan
to the podium.

36:25.648 --> 36:27.848
(students booing)
And I expect

36:27.850 --> 36:32.052
every courtesy to be
extended to our speaker.

36:37.993 --> 36:40.261
(students booing)

36:46.868 --> 36:48.335
Shut up and
let him speak!

36:48.337 --> 36:49.570
Who are you?

36:49.572 --> 36:50.971
Are you kidding me?
Well, then, don't...

36:50.973 --> 36:52.206
You got some...
Stop that.

36:52.208 --> 36:54.308
Stop it right now.

36:57.145 --> 36:58.345
Thank you.

37:09.791 --> 37:12.059
Good afternoon.

37:12.061 --> 37:13.928
You know, policing,

37:13.930 --> 37:15.896
by its very nature,

37:15.898 --> 37:17.565
involves conflict...
STUDENT: Frank Reagan, you can't hide!

37:17.567 --> 37:19.200
We charge you with homicide!

37:19.202 --> 37:20.634
(chanting):
Frank Reagan, you can't hide!

37:20.636 --> 37:22.403
We charge you with homicide!

37:22.405 --> 37:23.737
Frank Reagan, you can't hide!

37:23.739 --> 37:25.906
We charge you with homicide!

37:25.908 --> 37:27.208
Frank Reagan, you can't hide!

37:27.210 --> 37:29.276
We charge you with homicide!

37:29.278 --> 37:30.611
Frank Reagan, you can't hide!

37:30.613 --> 37:32.279
We charge you with homicide!

37:32.281 --> 37:35.049
Frank Reagan, you can't hide!

37:35.051 --> 37:36.851
We charge you with homicide!

37:36.853 --> 37:38.586
Frank Reagan, you can't hide!

37:38.588 --> 37:39.954
We charge you with homicide!

37:39.956 --> 37:42.022
Frank Reagan, you can't hide!

37:42.024 --> 37:44.058
We charge you with homicide!

37:44.060 --> 37:45.960
Frank Reagan, you can't hide!

37:45.962 --> 37:47.561
We charge you with homicide!
You know, I would be happy

37:47.563 --> 37:48.963
to listen to you,

37:48.965 --> 37:51.065
but it's hard
when you're all screaming.

37:51.067 --> 37:53.033
STUDENTS:
Frank Reagan, you can't hide!

37:53.035 --> 37:54.735
We charge you with homicide!

37:54.737 --> 37:56.270
Frank Reagan, you can't hide!

37:56.272 --> 37:57.805
We charge you with homicide!

37:57.807 --> 37:59.507
Frank Reagan, you can't hide!

37:59.509 --> 38:01.575
We charge you with homicide!

38:01.577 --> 38:03.744
(chanting and booing continues)

38:32.641 --> 38:35.543
(chanting dissolves
into cheering)

38:42.217 --> 38:44.385
I'm committed to my job

38:44.387 --> 38:47.721
the same way I'm committed
to my marriage-- 100%.

38:47.723 --> 38:50.791
Which used to be something
that my wife

38:50.793 --> 38:52.192
really loved about me.

38:52.194 --> 38:53.761
Now it is, apparently,

38:53.763 --> 38:55.029
something I have
to apologize for.

38:55.031 --> 38:57.531
No one's asking you
to apologize.

38:57.533 --> 38:59.433
I work 15 hours a day.

38:59.435 --> 39:01.468
Even more when
I'm working a case

39:01.470 --> 39:02.970
like the one I presently am.

39:02.972 --> 39:04.538
That's who I am.

39:04.540 --> 39:06.440
It's who I... I've always been.

39:06.442 --> 39:07.508
Now it's suddenly a problem.

39:07.510 --> 39:09.977
I want things to be normal
between us.

39:09.979 --> 39:11.779
Is this normal?

39:11.781 --> 39:13.514
This is... 'cause
it's not normal to me.

39:13.516 --> 39:15.349
Sitting in this room,

39:15.351 --> 39:17.952
spilling my guts to her--
no offense--

39:17.954 --> 39:19.620
who knows nothing about us,

39:19.622 --> 39:21.322
nothing about what
I do for a living,

39:21.324 --> 39:23.424
what you do for a living,
our marriage...

39:23.426 --> 39:27.494
Yet she wants to tell us
how to do all of it, suddenly.

39:30.632 --> 39:32.499
I just want things

39:32.501 --> 39:35.603
to go back to the way
that they were

39:35.605 --> 39:38.238
before that day.

39:40.075 --> 39:42.276
I'll do whatever you want.

39:42.278 --> 39:44.511
I'll do whatever it takes
to fix this.

39:50.485 --> 39:52.519
I am a guy who...

39:52.521 --> 39:56.123
is really good
at solving problems.

39:56.125 --> 39:58.626
I fix things.

39:58.628 --> 40:00.060
That's-that's my job.

40:02.063 --> 40:04.264
Um...

40:06.835 --> 40:09.503
I honestly have no idea

40:09.505 --> 40:11.839
how to fix this.

40:20.949 --> 40:22.883
(sighs)

40:35.664 --> 40:37.931
Horse walks into a bar.

40:37.933 --> 40:39.633
Bartender sees him
and says,

40:39.635 --> 40:41.735
"Why the long face"?

40:45.507 --> 40:46.707
I tried.

40:46.709 --> 40:49.343
You did too, Dad.

40:49.345 --> 40:50.878
I'm really sorry
about what happened.

40:50.880 --> 40:52.346
Me, too.

40:54.516 --> 40:55.849
You know, you don't stand up
for free speech

40:55.851 --> 40:57.017
by shutting someone else down.

40:57.019 --> 40:58.318
I'm with you on that.

40:58.320 --> 41:00.721
You don't get an education,
you get indoctrination.

41:00.723 --> 41:02.656
Everybody's entitled
to their own opinion,

41:02.658 --> 41:04.725
but no one's entitled
to their own facts.

41:04.727 --> 41:05.859
Second that.

41:05.861 --> 41:07.528
Can I say something?

41:07.530 --> 41:08.962
As long as you're not
defending the kids at school.

41:08.964 --> 41:10.864
Free speech, Jack.
Here and everywhere.

41:10.866 --> 41:12.266
Yeah, I know. Just saying.

41:12.268 --> 41:14.101
I know. And thank you.

41:14.103 --> 41:15.469
Go ahead, Nicky.

41:15.471 --> 41:18.072
Actually, it's something
I want to read.

41:22.944 --> 41:26.013
"It is not the critic
who counts;

41:26.015 --> 41:28.282
"not the man who points out

41:28.284 --> 41:30.651
"how the strong man stumbles,

41:30.653 --> 41:34.088
"or where the doer of deeds
could have done them better.

41:34.090 --> 41:37.658
"The credit belongs to the man

41:37.660 --> 41:39.593
"who is actually in the arena,

41:39.595 --> 41:43.030
"who spends himself
in a worthy cause;

41:43.032 --> 41:44.932
"who at the best
knows in the end

41:44.934 --> 41:47.634
"the triumph
of high achievement,

41:47.636 --> 41:50.604
"and who at the worst,
if he fails,

41:50.606 --> 41:52.973
"at least fails
while daring greatly,

41:52.975 --> 41:56.210
"so that his place
shall never be

41:56.212 --> 41:58.679
"with those cold and timid souls

41:58.681 --> 42:03.584
who neither know victory
nor defeat."

42:05.653 --> 42:07.554
Teddy Roosevelt.
