WEBVTT

00:09.050 --> 00:09.884
Wilkerson?

00:12.679 --> 00:13.930
Are you following me?

00:15.473 --> 00:17.559
You still in love with me
like back in high school?

00:19.352 --> 00:20.937
I was never interested in you.

00:21.020 --> 00:23.481
There are a lot of reasons
guys get erections in the shower.

00:25.734 --> 00:26.609
Yeah.

00:29.154 --> 00:30.155
Just fucking with you.

00:32.699 --> 00:33.825
I'll see you, bud.

00:33.908 --> 00:35.452
Yeah, hang on, Bennett.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.083
What's that in the truck?

00:42.667 --> 00:44.085
What's in the truck?

00:44.169 --> 00:46.421
It's an eight track player.

00:47.380 --> 00:48.298
[Wilkerson] Yeah.

00:48.381 --> 00:51.551
Looks like the generator stolen
from Neumann's Hill.

00:52.135 --> 00:53.011
Yeah.

00:54.220 --> 00:57.390
Yeah, you know what?
I'll be honest with you.

00:57.474 --> 00:59.601
I was driving home, speed limit, no beers.

01:01.394 --> 01:04.647
And I see something,
and I think to myself,

01:04.731 --> 01:08.193
"That looks like that
missing Neumann's Hill generator."

01:08.777 --> 01:13.990
So I'm like, "I'll load that up
and take it to my good friend, Wilkerson.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.742
Maybe he'll get a promotion.

01:15.825 --> 01:18.328
Maybe he'll be mayor someday.
He's got my vote."

01:20.705 --> 01:22.082
Where were you last Wednesday?

01:24.375 --> 01:25.376
Come on, man.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.379
I'm serious. Where were you?

01:30.215 --> 01:31.800
Why not ask your mom?

01:33.802 --> 01:35.386
Turn around. Put your hands on the car.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.931
Is this 'cause I nicknamed you Milkerson?

01:38.014 --> 01:40.600
You ain't got boobs no more.
Maybe I helped you lose weight.

01:42.018 --> 01:44.062
You have the right to remain silent.

01:44.562 --> 01:46.147
Okay, I tell you what.

01:46.231 --> 01:49.192
You let me go and I'll take you
on one of them roller-coasters

01:49.275 --> 01:51.861
you ain't tall enough to ride. [grunts]

01:51.945 --> 01:53.113
Come on, man.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.114
Whoa.

01:54.197 --> 01:55.156
Hey, bud, easy.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.408
What? You having a shower flashback?

01:58.159 --> 02:00.620
[theme song playing]

03:11.441 --> 03:15.111
You know that most newlyweds spend
their wedding money on a honeymoon,

03:15.194 --> 03:16.446
not bail.

03:19.407 --> 03:20.533
[clicks tongue]

03:20.617 --> 03:23.703
Swing by Dave and Buster's.
We'll do the honeymoon now.

03:27.206 --> 03:29.792
We agreed to be honest with each other,

03:30.376 --> 03:32.170
and you get arrested
for stealing a generator?

03:32.253 --> 03:33.713
I didn't steal it.

03:34.714 --> 03:36.883
Could you care to expound on that?

03:38.509 --> 03:40.136
It means tell me what you did.

03:41.971 --> 03:45.183
So far, you've made a joke,
denied responsibility.

03:45.266 --> 03:47.602
Just add "Rooster did it"
and it's your perfect excuse.

03:47.685 --> 03:49.270
-Rooster did do it.
-Oh, my God!

03:52.065 --> 03:53.524
The fire was coming.

03:54.108 --> 03:56.527
We needed a generator.
He took one from Neumann's Hill.

03:58.112 --> 04:00.782
I got caught ditching it.
I was trying to keep him out of trouble.

04:01.616 --> 04:03.117
Oh, keep him out of trouble.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.786
He is newly married,
with a baby on the way.

04:04.869 --> 04:06.788
No, wait. That's you.

04:08.706 --> 04:11.251
I was trying to protect Rooster.

04:11.876 --> 04:13.753
First my mom and then Rooster.

04:13.836 --> 04:17.048
Do you see a pattern here? Where you're
keeping secrets from your wife?

04:17.131 --> 04:18.341
[exhales]

04:18.424 --> 04:19.550
Yeah.

04:19.634 --> 04:21.302
Do you see how it angers me?

04:22.011 --> 04:23.179
Yeah.

04:24.639 --> 04:26.391
Then fucking stop!

04:29.060 --> 04:29.894
God.

04:30.395 --> 04:33.856
You were charged with a felony.
Wilkerson said you could go to jail

04:33.940 --> 04:36.442
-for a couple of years!
-I ain't going to jail.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.361
This is my first strike.

04:38.444 --> 04:39.654
In Colorado.

04:41.572 --> 04:42.532
This year.

04:45.034 --> 04:46.452
Under this name.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.289
Ah. Great.

04:49.914 --> 04:51.791
Why was I worried?
I feel so much better now.

04:51.874 --> 04:53.501
What do you want for breakfast? Arby's?

04:53.584 --> 04:54.419
Okay... [sighs]

04:56.212 --> 04:59.215
I'll talk to Rooster. And I'll fix it.

05:00.049 --> 05:01.092
[exhales]

05:01.175 --> 05:04.012
I know you're joking,
but Arby's does serve breakfast now.

05:08.182 --> 05:10.226
You better fix it, 'cause...

05:12.020 --> 05:13.604
you're gonna be a dad.

05:13.688 --> 05:14.689
[exhales]

05:15.315 --> 05:18.234
And you don't think I know
Arby's serves breakfast now?

05:18.318 --> 05:19.736
Come on. I'm five months pregnant.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.910
I spent 20 minutes looking for a nail gun.

05:28.619 --> 05:31.080
Why the hell was it in a box
with the Skilsaw?

05:31.164 --> 05:34.709
Because when the zombies come,
those are weapons number one and two.

05:36.419 --> 05:39.464
It may be pointless to you,
but I wanna know where all my shit is

05:39.547 --> 05:43.092
when a bunch of Neumann's Hill people
come crawling all over this place.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.720
Hey, I didn't want them here.
That's on you.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.306
Not all ideas are great.

05:49.098 --> 05:51.851
It was your mom's idea
to have fuckin' kids.

05:54.562 --> 05:55.396
Yeah.

05:56.397 --> 05:58.357
It was your mistake
not quitting after you had me.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.654
Be sure to keep an eye on her workers.

06:04.238 --> 06:06.199
Help 'em fix the fence we pulled.

06:06.783 --> 06:09.660
You'll need the posthole digger,
if you can remember where you left that.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.121
It's by the sawhorses.

06:12.872 --> 06:15.041
This is all just fucking chaos.

06:15.917 --> 06:17.752
-What's up, Ab?
-Hey, Abby.

06:19.962 --> 06:22.715
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

06:24.801 --> 06:26.803
Had to go with Abby to an appointment.

06:27.386 --> 06:29.388
Oh, yeah? Did you guys get an ultrasound?

06:29.889 --> 06:32.183
Does the baby have his daddy's beard?

06:36.270 --> 06:38.231
I'm gonna go fix the fence I cut.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.358
Put this back in the right place.

06:40.441 --> 06:43.111
Yeah, right next to the Skilsaw.

06:43.194 --> 06:45.404
In case the zombies come.
[imitates shooting]

06:47.657 --> 06:48.825
I hate you both.

06:51.327 --> 06:54.580
He's in a bad mood 'cause
he accidentally bought some turkey bacon.

06:56.999 --> 06:58.751
That led to a whole rant about how,

06:58.835 --> 07:01.379
if the liberals can get to bacon,
they can get to anything.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.677
Know where I really was all morning?

07:08.261 --> 07:09.095
Let me guess.

07:10.138 --> 07:12.223
Sephora having an anniversary sale?

07:16.936 --> 07:18.604
That's in January, you dick.

07:22.817 --> 07:23.943
I got arrested

07:25.111 --> 07:26.779
for trying to ditch that generator.

07:26.863 --> 07:27.864
What?

07:28.948 --> 07:30.408
Why were you ditching it?

07:30.992 --> 07:32.076
We needed to get rid of it.

07:32.660 --> 07:33.995
No, we didn't.

07:34.078 --> 07:35.872
Even if we did, you did it all wrong, man.

07:35.955 --> 07:38.207
You do it piece by piece,
like a dead body.

07:40.835 --> 07:43.421
You put an arm in a dumpster,
a leg in a field

07:43.504 --> 07:45.256
and then mail the thumb to the wife.

07:48.926 --> 07:53.890
I got arrested
for stealing a generator that you stole.

07:53.973 --> 07:58.811
No, you got arrested for trying to ditch
a generator you shouldn't have touched.

08:00.396 --> 08:02.773
[chuckles] Okay, so this is my fault?

08:02.857 --> 08:04.317
Uh, yeah.

08:05.776 --> 08:07.695
Do you want me to take the fall
for something I didn't do?

08:07.778 --> 08:09.322
That's what I'm doing!

08:11.115 --> 08:13.784
Look, dude,
if we'd left that generator here

08:13.868 --> 08:16.037
and someone saw it, it'd be on me.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.831
But you took matters
into your own hands, so it's on you.

08:19.916 --> 08:21.542
Maybe now you'll learn you never do
the right thing.

08:25.546 --> 08:26.380
Yeah.

08:26.464 --> 08:29.467
-[fires nail gun]
-Hey, that's not funny.

08:31.469 --> 08:33.513
If I go to jail,
it'll be for a good reason.

08:33.596 --> 08:35.431
-[fires nail gun]
-Hey! Come on, man.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.390
Hey!

08:36.474 --> 08:39.143
-[firing nail gun]
-Dance, boy! Dance!

08:47.109 --> 08:47.944
Beau.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.612
Hey.

08:49.695 --> 08:52.406
I didn't think you'd be home
till tomorrow.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.867
You're just in time to watch<i> Blue Bloods.</i>

08:57.286 --> 08:58.204
What's the matter?

08:59.956 --> 09:00.873
It's gone.

09:01.874 --> 09:02.708
What?

09:04.335 --> 09:07.630
The fire. My house.

09:07.713 --> 09:10.132
Everything in it. It's all gone.

09:12.009 --> 09:12.969
Jesus.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.012
I got off the highway

09:15.972 --> 09:16.931
and everything was burnt,

09:17.014 --> 09:19.725
but I was sure my house
would still be there.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.105
I'm so sorry.

09:24.188 --> 09:26.524
I got to my street, and...

09:28.067 --> 09:29.986
and there is nothing left.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.655
It's like a war zone.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.118
What can I do?

09:38.411 --> 09:39.537
I don't know.

09:39.620 --> 09:40.663
[sighs]

09:40.746 --> 09:41.747
I don't know.

09:41.831 --> 09:42.790
[chuckles]

09:43.916 --> 09:47.253
All I have left
is what I took to my daughter's.

09:51.549 --> 09:52.550
You'll get through this.

09:52.633 --> 09:53.467
Mmm.

09:54.552 --> 09:55.428
I mean, you...

09:56.220 --> 09:58.389
You survived a nasty divorce,

09:59.849 --> 10:01.684
your daughter's drug addiction,

10:02.893 --> 10:05.187
having a grumpy
son of a bitch for a boyfriend.

10:05.271 --> 10:06.647
[chuckles]

10:06.731 --> 10:08.733
I don't know where to start.

10:08.816 --> 10:10.234
Don't worry about it.

10:11.819 --> 10:13.362
You don't have to fix it right now.

10:15.239 --> 10:17.408
And you won't have to go through it alone.

10:18.909 --> 10:20.202
I'm here for you...

10:21.954 --> 10:23.331
whatever you need.

10:23.914 --> 10:26.417
Thank you, Beau. That means a lot.

10:28.836 --> 10:31.631
-Right now, I need a fuckin' drink.
-[both chuckle]

10:37.011 --> 10:37.887
Hey.

10:38.679 --> 10:39.639
Hey.

10:39.722 --> 10:42.516
I've been looking for you.
What're you doing here?

10:43.851 --> 10:44.894
Cleaning up.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.189
Hey, I found a new way into the basement.

10:48.272 --> 10:49.899
Don't step over there. Or there.

10:50.733 --> 10:51.567
Or there.

10:52.943 --> 10:55.071
So, did you talk to Rooster?

10:57.573 --> 10:59.367
Yeah. He said it's my fault.

11:00.743 --> 11:01.577
That's it?

11:02.161 --> 11:03.412
He's cool with you taking the blame?

11:05.706 --> 11:06.666
Yep.

11:06.749 --> 11:09.502
You better talk to the police.
Tell 'em what happened.

11:09.585 --> 11:11.253
That ain't how it works.

11:11.337 --> 11:15.758
I got caught with the generator
in the truck that was used to steal it.

11:15.841 --> 11:19.762
The picture on Wilkerson's dashcam is me
grabbing it, being like...

11:23.265 --> 11:26.477
At least tell 'em your side of the story
and get it on the record.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.312
I ain't ratting out Rooster.

11:28.396 --> 11:30.815
If someone's gonna get in trouble,

11:30.898 --> 11:32.650
it should be the person
who stole the generator.

11:32.733 --> 11:35.319
Hey, we got each other's backs, okay?

11:35.403 --> 11:37.113
Do you know how many punches
he took for me?

11:37.196 --> 11:39.031
Do you know how many DUIs
I've gotten for him?

11:40.783 --> 11:44.870
In third grade, this kid Chris Franklin
was gonna kick my ass after school.

11:44.954 --> 11:47.289
Rooster showed up with a water gun
spray-painted black

11:47.373 --> 11:48.999
and scared the shit out of him.

11:49.083 --> 11:52.545
This isn't threatening a kid
with a gun, okay? This is serious.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.172
I'll take care of it.

11:55.256 --> 11:58.968
I can't do this. The generator, the fire,
moving back to Denver.

11:59.051 --> 12:01.053
Not to mention my hormones
are going crazy.

12:01.137 --> 12:02.638
The baby has sharp elbows.

12:02.721 --> 12:03.931
I am losing my shit!

12:04.014 --> 12:06.058
-All right, come on. Sit down.
-[sighs]

12:09.353 --> 12:11.313
-You can't be stressed out.
-Well...

12:11.397 --> 12:13.774
If you're stressed, the baby's stressed.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.946
You two are the most
important things in my life.

12:19.572 --> 12:22.158
-We'll find a way to fix this.
-How?

12:23.617 --> 12:25.661
-I'm not sure, but--
-Get sure, fast!

12:25.744 --> 12:28.497
Do you think you're the only one
with problems?

12:28.581 --> 12:31.167
Our house burned down. I got arrested.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.043
Your dad hates me. My mom's gone.

12:33.127 --> 12:35.337
The Broncos don't have
a fucking quarterback.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.506
I'm losing my shit, Ab!

12:37.590 --> 12:38.883
[groans]

12:39.925 --> 12:42.553
[inhales] That was stone.
We gotta go to urgent care.

12:50.811 --> 12:52.688
-What's up, Hank?
-Rooster.

12:52.771 --> 12:54.899
-Hey, Mary.
-Hey, Rooster. How you doing?

12:54.982 --> 12:56.108
Shitty.

12:56.650 --> 13:00.279
Aw. What's wrong?
Your beard's Instagram lose followers?

13:02.490 --> 13:05.326
Nope. It's still the same seven dudes.

13:08.412 --> 13:10.789
I'm with you till the end, brother.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.003
What's going on?

13:16.587 --> 13:17.838
Fucking Colt, man.

13:20.174 --> 13:22.259
I jacked a generator from Neumann's Hill.

13:22.343 --> 13:25.763
Colt wet his pants
and got arrested trying to ditch it.

13:26.388 --> 13:27.389
What?

13:27.473 --> 13:30.142
You don't return something
after you stole it.

13:33.062 --> 13:36.232
I didn't mail back my first wedding dress
to Nordstrom Rack.

13:38.275 --> 13:40.444
-Goddamn, you're cool.
-[chuckles] I know.

13:47.326 --> 13:48.702
Hey, babe, how's it going?

13:49.453 --> 13:52.456
Not bad. I just finished work,
trying to unwind.

13:55.417 --> 13:56.377
Funny.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.629
[chuckles] Yeah.
You want a drink, sweetie?

13:59.213 --> 14:01.340
On the house. Anything you want.

14:01.423 --> 14:02.925
From the well.

14:03.008 --> 14:04.927
My mom would yell at me
if we give you something nicer.

14:09.098 --> 14:13.352
But it's gotta beat that toilet hooch
you drank in prison, right?

14:16.021 --> 14:17.356
I'll take a beer.

14:19.733 --> 14:21.944
I forgot this was your ma's place.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.572
Yeah, I've drunk here since I was eight.

14:27.283 --> 14:30.286
Rooster had a DUI before he knew his ABCs.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.958
Well, great.
It's nice to sit and drink together.

14:36.041 --> 14:39.295
Like the wedding. Remember we talked
to each other there, Rooster?

14:46.302 --> 14:47.803
Yeah, that was real fun.

14:51.223 --> 14:52.182
It sure was.

15:04.194 --> 15:06.280
I should be leavin'. [groans]

15:07.531 --> 15:12.119
Some of the guys from my biker gang
are down at the firing range, so...

15:15.080 --> 15:18.250
You know, like, as their leader,
I should probably be there.

15:24.924 --> 15:25.758
[Lisa] Great.

15:26.842 --> 15:27.885
9:00 a.m. works.

15:29.637 --> 15:30.638
Hey, Colt.

15:32.431 --> 15:33.557
Hey.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.893
This is... wow. This is nice.

15:36.518 --> 15:39.772
This is like that guy, Teddy Roosevelt
from <i>Night at the Museum's </i>office.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.066
This is...

15:43.150 --> 15:43.984
Uh...

15:44.568 --> 15:46.153
Thanks for meeting me.

15:46.236 --> 15:48.405
Of course, have a seat.

15:48.906 --> 15:52.785
I got suckered into buying fancy chairs,
and nobody ever sits in them.

15:55.371 --> 15:57.331
And now I know why. They suck.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.085
What can I do for you?

16:02.378 --> 16:03.337
Yeah...

16:04.797 --> 16:06.715
Uh... [chuckles]

16:07.341 --> 16:11.220
When we agreed to take your herd,
you said you'd return the favor.

16:11.303 --> 16:12.262
-Mmm-hmm.
-So...

16:13.347 --> 16:14.598
I'm here to collect on that.

16:15.933 --> 16:18.811
Ah, I'm sorry, is that a Civil War rifle?

16:18.894 --> 16:20.062
Well, yes, it is.

16:20.729 --> 16:22.523
-Can I hold it?
-Is that the favor?

16:22.606 --> 16:23.440
No.

16:23.524 --> 16:24.525
Then, no.

16:27.277 --> 16:29.279
What is this favor you want?

16:30.698 --> 16:31.532
Right.

16:34.284 --> 16:35.995
Well, I'm not proud of this...

16:37.746 --> 16:39.915
but before the fire,
our generator crapped out.

16:42.042 --> 16:44.503
So I took one from one of your ranches.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.840
I got caught by the cops
when I tried to get rid of it.

16:49.550 --> 16:51.677
You stole one of our generators?

16:52.261 --> 16:53.095
I did.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.014
I'm sorry.

16:56.265 --> 16:59.226
We were desperate.
We needed it for our sprinklers.

16:59.309 --> 17:00.811
We thought our house would burn down.

17:00.894 --> 17:03.689
You know that
they have generators at Walmart.

17:05.274 --> 17:06.108
Yeah. [chuckles]

17:06.191 --> 17:08.652
Good luck trying to get one
past one of them greeters.

17:12.239 --> 17:15.617
Look... I know it was stupid.

17:16.118 --> 17:16.952
I...

17:17.453 --> 17:18.412
I just...

17:21.373 --> 17:22.875
We don't have a lot of cash lying around.

17:22.958 --> 17:24.043
We ain't like...

17:25.669 --> 17:27.254
Our microwave is cracked.

17:27.337 --> 17:30.799
[stammering] Basically, you press start
and run to the living room.

17:32.342 --> 17:35.721
Look, Colt, I didn't grow up
with a lot of money,

17:35.804 --> 17:37.389
and I've known tough times,

17:37.473 --> 17:39.058
-but it's no excuse--
-No, I know...

17:39.141 --> 17:40.684
Ma'am, it's not an excuse.

17:43.353 --> 17:44.438
I screwed up.

17:45.981 --> 17:46.982
I'm really sorry.

17:48.984 --> 17:50.027
I was just...

17:51.320 --> 17:54.907
I was hoping maybe you'd consider
dropping the charges.

17:56.867 --> 17:58.202
That's a pretty big ask.

17:59.703 --> 18:00.537
I know.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.335
I should've never
put you in this position.

18:07.211 --> 18:08.087
I'm sorry.

18:08.587 --> 18:10.047
Where's the generator now?

18:12.716 --> 18:13.801
The cops took it.

18:14.843 --> 18:16.970
You can call that Officer Wilkerson.

18:17.054 --> 18:19.014
He's the one that looks
like a future Walmart greeter.

18:22.935 --> 18:23.769
Sorry.

18:24.686 --> 18:25.521
Wait.

18:27.022 --> 18:29.358
I said I owed you a favor, so...

18:30.484 --> 18:32.152
we'll drop the charges.

18:33.779 --> 18:34.947
-Really?
-[clicks tongue] Well...

18:35.531 --> 18:38.826
I get my generator back
and everyone makes mistakes.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.912
Even me. I hired your brother.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.751
[softly] Thank you so much. I...

18:48.460 --> 18:51.630
You have no idea what this means to me.
I'm...

18:51.713 --> 18:54.800
I'll send an edible arrangement
to your office.

18:54.883 --> 18:56.093
The tropical ones.

18:56.176 --> 18:59.513
That way, you'll wake up in Colorado,
but be havin' breakfast in Jamaica.

19:00.931 --> 19:01.765
All right.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.601
You're taking our cows.
How about we call it even?

19:05.811 --> 19:07.354
Deal. Thank you.

19:07.437 --> 19:09.022
-All right.
-So much.

19:12.442 --> 19:13.777
Three weeks?

19:14.278 --> 19:16.697
Well, your company policy can kiss my ass.

19:17.281 --> 19:18.282
[chuckles]

19:19.366 --> 19:22.911
That's why I keep a landline.
So I can hang up on people.

19:23.871 --> 19:27.457
It's a lot more satisfying
than slapping shut my flip phone.

19:29.376 --> 19:31.253
It didn't go well
with the insurance company?

19:31.336 --> 19:33.005
No, it went great.

19:33.088 --> 19:36.550
Yeah, they're gonna send out
an assessor out in three weeks

19:36.633 --> 19:40.095
to determine whether or not my burnt-out,
vacant lot is still livable.

19:40.762 --> 19:42.598
Well, cut 'em some slack.

19:42.681 --> 19:44.892
They gotta come all the way from Bombay.

19:46.518 --> 19:49.062
They want me to itemize what I lost.
How...

19:49.146 --> 19:51.857
How do I put a dollar value
on family photos,

19:51.940 --> 19:56.153
or my mom's tea set or that ashtray
my granddaughter made for me.

19:56.236 --> 20:00.073
That thing was so goddamn cute
I almost started smoking again.

20:00.991 --> 20:04.036
The important thing is you
and your family are safe.

20:05.370 --> 20:06.705
Had I said yesterday

20:06.788 --> 20:09.583
you could trade all your possessions
for your family's safety,

20:09.666 --> 20:11.710
-would you have done it?
-Well, of course. Who wouldn't?

20:13.045 --> 20:13.879
Well...

20:16.089 --> 20:17.382
And on top of that,

20:17.466 --> 20:20.260
the hotel I picked isn't
on the insurance company's list.

20:20.969 --> 20:22.721
I don't know
how those people sleep at night.

20:22.804 --> 20:25.098
I can tell you it's
not in the La Quinta Inn.

20:26.558 --> 20:30.312
I never thought I'd have to start
all over again at my age.

20:30.896 --> 20:33.649
-Why not stay here for a while?
-What?

20:34.233 --> 20:35.359
We got room for you.

20:35.943 --> 20:38.237
Well, that's a very sweet offer,
Beau, but...

20:38.320 --> 20:42.866
I don't wanna be a burden on you
and you got a lot of people around here.

20:42.950 --> 20:44.952
Yeah, but I don't like any of them.

20:45.869 --> 20:49.706
This will be more than a weekend together.
Rebuilding could take months.

20:49.790 --> 20:52.626
I think it's best if I stay
with my daughter in Arizona.

20:52.709 --> 20:55.629
I don't want you to be gone that long.
I'd miss you.

20:55.712 --> 20:57.089
I'd miss you too.

20:57.172 --> 21:01.009
So come here
until you get back on your feet.

21:02.135 --> 21:03.762
Or till you get sick of me.

21:03.845 --> 21:05.764
Where do I stay tomorrow night?

21:15.941 --> 21:17.901
-What are you doing?
-[Rooster] Hey.

21:18.485 --> 21:20.487
Oh. Uh, it's for the squirrels.

21:20.570 --> 21:22.864
I like when they get drunk
and run into each other.

21:23.657 --> 21:24.616
[chuckles]

21:25.409 --> 21:26.368
I get it.

21:27.160 --> 21:29.830
I did the same thing
with my kids and cough medicine.

21:32.541 --> 21:33.750
[grunts]

21:35.335 --> 21:37.713
What's up with you? What brings you by?

21:44.761 --> 21:46.054
Well, shit.

21:46.930 --> 21:48.348
I can't even sit alone in the woods

21:48.432 --> 21:50.434
without hot chicks
trying to make out with me.

21:50.517 --> 21:51.476
[chuckles]

21:53.103 --> 21:54.187
What about Prison Nick?

21:55.063 --> 21:56.398
Yeah, well...

21:57.107 --> 21:59.651
After you left he bar, he was an asshole.

21:59.735 --> 22:01.903
I don't want to go back home
with him, so...

22:02.571 --> 22:03.488
here I am.

22:06.700 --> 22:10.579
Yeah, okay, but a few days ago, you said
you two were trying to make it work.

22:11.705 --> 22:13.332
Which I don't understand,

22:13.415 --> 22:17.085
because he kinda looks like
a methed-out Keith Urban.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.587
[chuckles]

22:20.797 --> 22:22.174
If you want me to leave,

22:22.257 --> 22:25.260
I'm sure I'll find another guy
in the woods, getting animals drunk.

22:27.137 --> 22:28.805
No, no, we can hang out.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.266
But can you just...

22:31.349 --> 22:33.518
Like, why exactly was he in prison?

22:34.811 --> 22:35.645
Which time?

22:37.689 --> 22:38.565
Yeah, okay.

22:41.735 --> 22:45.405
-You breakin' up or--
-You really wanna talk about Nick?

22:45.489 --> 22:47.449
I didn't come here for therapy.

22:47.532 --> 22:48.867
I came here to fuck.

22:50.494 --> 22:53.747
That is the single greatest sentence
I've heard in my entire life.

23:02.631 --> 23:03.715
[Colt] Hey.

23:03.799 --> 23:05.092
Good, you got my text.

23:05.592 --> 23:08.095
Yeah, but I thought
we'd meet at the house,

23:08.178 --> 23:10.889
'cause I got five million things
to do before I go to Denver,

23:10.972 --> 23:13.225
and I was hoping to leave
in the next hour.

23:13.308 --> 23:14.935
Why would you start a fire?

23:17.020 --> 23:18.105
What will happen?

23:20.023 --> 23:21.691
-So, what's up?
-Come here.

23:24.611 --> 23:25.695
All right.

23:25.779 --> 23:28.448
I went and I talked to Ms. Neumann.

23:29.032 --> 23:30.826
-Well...
-Yeah?

23:30.909 --> 23:31.743
Okay.

23:34.830 --> 23:36.081
She'll drop the charges.

23:37.040 --> 23:40.168
-What? Are you serious?
-Yeah.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.711
Wait. How'd you convince her?

23:41.795 --> 23:43.839
I won't even be mad if you say
you slept with her.

23:46.049 --> 23:46.883
Well...

23:47.425 --> 23:49.845
I analyzed the situation.

23:49.928 --> 23:51.263
I sat down with her.

23:51.346 --> 23:53.640
I made an intelligent argument.

23:53.723 --> 23:54.599
She was convinced.

23:55.183 --> 23:57.269
I thought we agreed, no more lyin'.

23:59.312 --> 24:00.397
I'm serious.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.232
We're helping her out.

24:02.816 --> 24:04.192
So she helped me out.

24:04.776 --> 24:07.404
I said I'd take care of it,
and, for once, I actually did.

24:07.988 --> 24:10.157
Colt, this is huge.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.909
I didn't wanna leave
with this hanging over us.

24:13.493 --> 24:14.411
I got another surprise for you.

24:15.328 --> 24:18.373
Well, could your surprise be quitting
while you're ahead?

24:19.291 --> 24:24.254
Okay, remember how I didn't wanna know if
the baby's a boy or girl, but you did?

24:24.337 --> 24:27.299
Yeah, it was the same day
you asked the ultrasound technician

24:27.382 --> 24:29.843
if you could get a close-up
of the baby's throwing arm.

24:31.261 --> 24:33.263
-[Abby chuckles]
-Okay, well...

24:33.346 --> 24:34.890
I called the doctor,

24:34.973 --> 24:37.767
I asked him to write the gender
and put it in a sealed envelope,

24:38.602 --> 24:42.439
and then I took it to Party City.

24:43.023 --> 24:44.357
Oh, my God.

24:45.901 --> 24:47.235
It's full of confetti.

24:47.986 --> 24:51.323
So, if it's blue, it's a boy.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.783
And if it's pink, it's a girl.

24:53.867 --> 24:54.868
If it's another color,

24:54.951 --> 24:58.788
that stupid teenager taking selfies
behind the counter didn't listen at all.

25:00.373 --> 25:01.833
This is so sweet.

25:01.917 --> 25:05.253
I mean, are you sure you wanna know?

25:05.337 --> 25:08.215
You freaked out when you learned
Darth Vader was Luke's father.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.260
I wanna know.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.347
And I wanna do it together.

25:16.431 --> 25:18.850
Right here, in our new house...

25:19.935 --> 25:23.063
standing in our living room or kitchen.

25:23.396 --> 25:24.856
Whatever the fuck room it is.

25:24.940 --> 25:26.107
[Abby laughs]

25:27.567 --> 25:30.362
Okay, let's do it.

25:31.321 --> 25:32.155
Here we go.

25:32.239 --> 25:33.365
Ahh!

25:34.407 --> 25:35.325
One...

25:36.910 --> 25:37.786
-two...
-Wait!

25:37.869 --> 25:40.163
Jesus Christ, Ab, I'm holding a knife!

25:41.456 --> 25:44.626
I'm sorry. I don't know.
I think I wanna wait.

25:46.419 --> 25:47.295
Really?

25:48.129 --> 25:49.714
Yeah, right? I mean...

25:50.715 --> 25:52.092
We've come this far.

25:52.175 --> 25:56.054
I don't know. I feel like we'll find out
when we're supposed to.

25:57.555 --> 25:58.390
Are you sure?

25:59.599 --> 26:00.433
[groans]

26:01.017 --> 26:02.394
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

26:02.477 --> 26:03.311
Yes.

26:05.105 --> 26:06.564
-Sure.
-Okay. [chuckles]

26:06.648 --> 26:07.774
-[Abby chuckles] Okay.
-All right.

26:07.857 --> 26:09.109
-All right.
-Balloon...

26:10.443 --> 26:11.319
be free.

26:13.071 --> 26:14.864
I hope my dad sees you

26:14.948 --> 26:17.117
and thinks the government's
controlling the weather.

26:20.161 --> 26:21.329
I'm gonna miss you.

26:23.665 --> 26:24.749
I'll miss you too.

26:27.043 --> 26:28.044
[balloon pops]

26:28.795 --> 26:29.879
[Abby gasps]

26:30.505 --> 26:32.090
-[Colt] Oh, my God.
-[laughing]

26:32.173 --> 26:33.508
It's a girl!

26:34.175 --> 26:35.010
[laughs]

26:35.093 --> 26:37.429
Oh, my God.
I guess we were supposed to find out.

26:37.512 --> 26:38.722
I guess.

26:38.805 --> 26:41.516
I can't wait to braid her hair
and do her nails.

26:42.517 --> 26:45.270
We can dress her up as
Minnie Mouse and go to Disneyland.

26:45.353 --> 26:47.230
I'll finally go to Disneyland!

26:47.314 --> 26:48.273
Oh, my gosh!

26:49.024 --> 26:50.025
-[chuckles]
-[sighs]

26:50.108 --> 26:51.109
I'm so excited.

26:52.694 --> 26:53.903
Even though it's not a boy?

26:54.487 --> 26:58.116
Yeah! She's gonna be the first
girl quarterback in the NFL!

26:58.867 --> 27:01.202
First girl not named Aaron Rodgers.

27:03.079 --> 27:05.206
-[Abby laughs]
-I love you so fucking much.

27:22.640 --> 27:23.475
Oh, hey, Beau.

27:24.309 --> 27:25.226
Hey, Lisa.

27:25.810 --> 27:27.896
Here's your first month's expenses.

27:29.064 --> 27:31.024
I wanted to deliver it in person.

27:31.608 --> 27:34.277
I don't trust the government
with my mail or my money.

27:36.696 --> 27:39.366
I guess we're more alike than I realized.

27:40.742 --> 27:41.576
Thank you.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.119
How did it go today?

27:43.661 --> 27:47.624
Well, I expected to spend the day
yelling at your crew.

27:47.707 --> 27:51.336
But I just ended up yelling
at my boys to stay out of their way.

27:53.296 --> 27:57.425
That's what happens when you hire good
employees instead of breeding bad ones.

28:00.470 --> 28:05.183
Is it okay to bring the cattle tomorrow?
We should get finished by mid-morning.

28:05.266 --> 28:06.101
Sure.

28:06.184 --> 28:08.436
But mid-morning for me is 5:00 a.m.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.687
So, you sleep in?

28:12.524 --> 28:14.442
-Thanks. See you tomorrow.
-Right.

28:14.526 --> 28:18.488
And tell Colt that
that thing has been taken care of.

28:18.571 --> 28:19.864
What thing?

28:20.448 --> 28:23.493
The generator thing. It never happened.

28:24.077 --> 28:26.621
Generator? What the hell did he do?

28:27.205 --> 28:31.167
Well, he didn't tell me not to mention it,
although now I'm wishing that he had.

28:34.379 --> 28:37.549
It's probably better
if you talk to him about it.

28:38.133 --> 28:40.927
I don't talk to my friends.
Why should I talk to my son?

28:41.010 --> 28:42.429
[chuckles softly]

28:43.263 --> 28:46.933
-What'd he do?
-Look, it's not a big deal.

28:48.184 --> 28:51.020
He borrowed one of our generators
without asking.

28:51.104 --> 28:52.605
He stole a generator?

28:53.189 --> 28:55.775
He explained to me
that you guys were in a bind.

28:55.859 --> 28:57.610
Jesus Christ.

28:58.987 --> 29:01.781
Don't worry. We're gonna drop the charges.

29:01.865 --> 29:03.324
-Don't.
-What?

29:03.408 --> 29:05.160
Don't drop the charges.

29:06.077 --> 29:09.289
It's time he learned
that his actions had consequences.

29:09.914 --> 29:12.041
[chuckles] Beau,
it is none of my business,

29:12.125 --> 29:14.294
but I am willing to let this go.

29:14.377 --> 29:15.587
I'm not.
