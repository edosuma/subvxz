00:02.736 --> 00:04.338
(Mindy)
It's been three months
since I left New York

00:04.372 --> 00:05.339
for my fellowship at Stanford.

00:05.373 --> 00:06.707
And not to brag,

00:06.740 --> 00:08.676
but I am straight-up
killing this bitch.

00:08.709 --> 00:10.544
The program.
Not the patient.

00:10.578 --> 00:12.246
(male doctor)
Oof. Wow.

00:12.280 --> 00:15.183
(Mindy)
And I'm helping people
in ways I never imagined.

00:15.216 --> 00:17.451
The in vitro was a success.

00:17.485 --> 00:19.387
Congratulations, Mom.

00:19.420 --> 00:20.621
You're gonna be a daddy.

00:20.654 --> 00:22.290
I love you.
Aw.

00:23.724 --> 00:26.627
Mm.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.229
Okay.

00:28.262 --> 00:30.064
I'll give you some space.

00:30.098 --> 00:31.165
I've even made friends.

00:31.199 --> 00:34.502
Yes, it's safe to say
I'm loving my life out here.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.304
There's only one problem.

00:36.337 --> 00:37.538
I hate California.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.140
I mean,
what's with this Alcatraz?

00:39.173 --> 00:40.541
I'm just saying,
there's no movie called

00:40.574 --> 00:41.542
Escape from Rikers.

00:41.575 --> 00:42.543
You know why?

00:42.576 --> 00:44.412
Because you can't.
Cool.

00:44.445 --> 00:45.746
Can we please
go out today, Danny?

00:45.779 --> 00:47.181
Nah, let's just
stay in tonight.

00:47.215 --> 00:48.549
I'll make some
pasta "frazool."

00:48.582 --> 00:50.618
And I know what kind of produce
they grow out here--

00:50.651 --> 00:53.154
puff, puff--

00:53.187 --> 00:54.188
so I came prepared.

00:54.222 --> 00:55.523
Oh, my God.

00:55.556 --> 00:56.590
Look at this saus-eege.

00:56.624 --> 00:59.327
I got into a big fight
with TSA over this stuff.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.295
Come on, you're only here
for three days.

01:01.329 --> 01:02.296
I want you to come out

01:02.330 --> 01:04.198
so you can see my groovy
San Francisco lifestyle.

01:04.232 --> 01:06.234
All right.
Fine.

01:06.267 --> 01:08.369
But I'm wearing
my bicycle helmet

01:08.402 --> 01:09.837
just in case
there's an earthquake.

01:09.870 --> 01:11.639
I got you one too.

01:11.672 --> 01:14.442
(Mindy)
I knew that if I was going
to get the ultimate New Yorker

01:14.475 --> 01:16.344
to love San Francisco,

01:16.377 --> 01:19.480
I'd have to give him a weekend
he wouldn't "fuhged about."

01:23.184 --> 01:24.885
Danny, slow down!
Stop!

01:24.918 --> 01:27.555
And I could tell
Danny was impressed.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.557
The steep hills
make everything exercise,

01:29.590 --> 01:31.692
and there were some trees
that were older than him.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.864
The surprise was,
somewhere in between

01:36.897 --> 01:39.400
that big red bridge
and the famous street train,

01:39.433 --> 01:42.536
I realized that San Francisco
was starting to feel like home,

01:42.570 --> 01:44.738
and I'm gonna be sad to leave.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.274
Okay, Danny, be honest.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.242
Do you still think
that this place

01:48.276 --> 01:50.878
is just a giant weed dispensary
between dim sum places?

01:50.911 --> 01:51.912
You know what?

01:51.945 --> 01:53.347
I see the appeal.

01:53.381 --> 01:55.149
Yeah?
It's your favorite place?

01:57.318 --> 01:59.320
Get on your bike helmet
and get down!

01:59.353 --> 02:01.289
We're all gonna die!
Get down, Mindy!

02:01.322 --> 02:04.825
Charlton Heston said
we should go to higher ground!

02:04.858 --> 02:07.295
[sighs]
Okay.

02:07.328 --> 02:10.231
Now, where were we?

02:10.264 --> 02:14.602
Yeah, I'm gonna go
take a shower.

02:14.635 --> 02:15.869
It's back on again!

02:15.903 --> 02:17.238
It's back on
again!

02:17.271 --> 02:18.539
Everybody get down!

02:18.572 --> 02:21.542
[hip-hop music]

02:21.575 --> 02:23.244
*

02:23.277 --> 02:24.945
(Mindy)
Rob, why did you ask me

02:24.978 --> 02:26.747
to meet you as this address
all alone?

02:26.780 --> 02:28.549
Okay, just because
I look like Olivia Pope

02:28.582 --> 02:30.618
does not mean that I know
how to disappear a body.

02:30.651 --> 02:31.785
What?
No, no.

02:31.819 --> 02:32.853
All right, look,
how would you feel

02:32.886 --> 02:35.756
about starting a world-class
fertility clinic here?

02:35.789 --> 02:37.591
What? Really?
Yeah!

02:37.625 --> 02:39.427
Okay, wait. Just--all right.
Come in. All right, picture it.

02:39.460 --> 02:42.430
You come in the door,
and this could be your office.

02:42.463 --> 02:44.698
This is my office?

02:44.732 --> 02:46.400
Yeah, the whole thing.

02:46.434 --> 02:47.968
Oh, my God, I'd have a balcony
like Saddam.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.937
Okay, just--look,
after your fellowship,

02:49.970 --> 02:50.871
this is the next step.

02:50.904 --> 02:53.307
You know, it is cool
that I can do stuff here

02:53.341 --> 02:54.308
that I can't do in New York.

02:54.342 --> 02:57.345
But what about
my little meatball back home?

02:57.378 --> 02:58.346
Oh, that's the best part.

02:58.379 --> 02:59.480
I thought Danny could come too.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.681
Really?
Yeah.

03:00.714 --> 03:01.782
You said he loved it
when he came

03:01.815 --> 03:02.683
and visited San Francisco.

03:02.716 --> 03:03.917
And he made friends
with that drag queen.

03:03.951 --> 03:06.720
I'm pretty sure he thought
that was the real Tina Turner.

03:06.754 --> 03:07.588
Oh.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.690
But "Lahiri, Castellano,
and Gurgler"--

03:09.723 --> 03:10.758
rolls right off the tongue.

03:10.791 --> 03:11.925
All right,
so what do you say?

03:11.959 --> 03:13.594
Let me discuss it with him
this weekend.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.963
Because, who knows,
maybe Danny will be chill

03:15.996 --> 03:17.331
about a huge life change.

03:17.365 --> 03:18.499
When do you need to know by?

03:18.532 --> 03:20.734
Okay, all right, we've got 72
hours if we want this space.

03:20.768 --> 03:22.903
Because the city wants to
come in and turn it into a place

03:22.936 --> 03:24.672
where rescue dogs
can get methadone.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.308
Damn San Francisco.
I know.

03:27.341 --> 03:29.377
(Morgan)
What? Lauren's moving?

03:29.410 --> 03:31.445
(Jeremy)
Yep, she's made up
her mind.

03:31.479 --> 03:33.581
Apparently
she's going back to Texas.

03:33.614 --> 03:35.249
Okay, which one is Texas?

03:35.283 --> 03:37.451
Is that where Boston is?

03:37.485 --> 03:40.621
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
So...Lauren's moving?

03:40.654 --> 03:42.790
All I know is that
she broke up with me

03:42.823 --> 03:45.359
because things got quite
too complicated here.

03:45.393 --> 03:48.896
Ah. Complicated.

03:48.929 --> 03:50.298
Have another hug.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.265
I don't want another hug.

03:51.299 --> 03:52.266
I've had four.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.001
Thank you though.
So sweet.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.369
Yeah, that can be--
oh, yeah.

03:55.403 --> 03:56.270
You--you take your time.

03:56.304 --> 03:57.271
Sorry, buddy.

03:57.305 --> 03:58.472
Huh, huh, huh, huh?
[groans]

03:58.506 --> 03:59.473
Your pokes are so hard.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.409
Okay, I saw what you and Lauren
were doing.

04:01.442 --> 04:02.810
I saw you two kissing.
What else did you do?

04:02.843 --> 04:03.811
Nothing.
Topless hugging?

04:03.844 --> 04:04.945
No!
Bottomless dancing?

04:04.978 --> 04:06.380
No!
Prove it.

04:06.414 --> 04:07.648
Show me a photo of you two
not doing it.

04:07.681 --> 04:08.649
Okay.
You can't.

04:08.682 --> 04:09.750
Yes, I can.
Okay.

04:09.783 --> 04:10.751
I hope you're happy
with yourself.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.353
I am not happy with myself.

04:12.386 --> 04:13.354
You think I have a chance
with her

04:13.387 --> 04:14.355
now that she's moving to Texas?

04:14.388 --> 04:15.856
When am I ever gonna be
in Texas?

04:15.889 --> 04:17.425
Besides the biggest paintball
tournament in the world,

04:17.458 --> 04:19.360
but I'm gonna be playing
paintball the whole time.

04:19.393 --> 04:20.828
You're right.
You're right.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.596
(Mindy)
Hey, thank you so much

04:22.630 --> 04:24.298
for picking me up
from the airport.

04:24.332 --> 04:25.399
It's only been
a couple of weeks,

04:25.433 --> 04:26.500
but you have so many
more gray hairs.

04:26.534 --> 04:28.936
When I first saw you,
I thought you were Roger DeNiro.

04:28.969 --> 04:31.071
Ma says it looks presidential.
I don't know.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.205
So what's with
the surprise visit?

04:32.239 --> 04:34.308
I still haven't fixed
the headboard from last time.

04:34.342 --> 04:35.376
Okay.

04:35.409 --> 04:38.679
Yesterday,
I was talking to Rob, and--

04:38.712 --> 04:39.880
Hey, Danny?
Hmm?

04:39.913 --> 04:41.682
Your neighborhood
sure does look different.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.984
Where's the Freedom Tower?
Oh, no.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.753
It's not my neighborhood,
knucklehead.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.955
See, this is why Ma should be
my Amazing Rac partner.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.557
Okay, but would she eat
a bucket of worms?

04:49.590 --> 04:50.558
I would.

04:50.591 --> 04:51.859
Great. Now I'm hungry.

04:51.892 --> 04:52.860
We're in Harlem.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.061
Harlem?
Yeah.

04:54.094 --> 04:55.095
Are you taking me
to the Apollo?

04:55.128 --> 04:56.129
I can't go.

04:56.163 --> 04:58.766
Katt Williams had me banned
for laughing too hard.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.067
Hold on a second.
Hold on.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.336
Okay, take a look at this.

05:02.370 --> 05:03.937
See that building?

05:03.971 --> 05:05.873
Oh,
it's a really nice building.

05:05.906 --> 05:10.378
Oh, no, not the nice one.
The one right next to it.

05:10.411 --> 05:11.545
Oh.

05:11.579 --> 05:13.514
Babe, it's ours.

05:13.547 --> 05:14.615
What?

05:14.648 --> 05:17.518
A brownstone in Manhattan
like you always wanted.

05:17.551 --> 05:19.387
We can finally put down
some roots.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.094
This is it.

05:27.127 --> 05:30.698
Wow, it's like the brothel
that Don Draper was raised in.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.032
Check this out.
Okay.

05:32.065 --> 05:34.067
Living room.
Dot and Mom hang out there.

05:34.101 --> 05:36.036
Babe, we got a backyard.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.572
Right now, it's a pet cemetery,
but not the haunted kind.

05:38.606 --> 05:39.973
They got to disclose that.

05:42.810 --> 05:43.677
You okay?
Yeah.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.078
It just--the last time
we talked about

05:45.112 --> 05:46.747
living together,
you were pretty resistant.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.416
Yeah, well,
since you've been away,

05:48.449 --> 05:51.118
I've realized how important
it is that we're together.

05:51.151 --> 05:53.721
Yeah. together. Together.
Here in New York.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.956
Hey, uh, just a reminder,
we should leave.

05:55.989 --> 05:57.925
Human nighttime is rat daytime.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.092
Thanks, Ray.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.594
Is there a big rat problem?

06:00.628 --> 06:01.862
No, it's no big deal.

06:01.895 --> 06:02.730
No, it's--it's pretty bad.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.932
It's a Temple of Doom
type situation.

06:04.965 --> 06:06.834
[scoffs]
He's so over-the-top.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.637
Yeah, it's a little, you know,
rough around the edges.

06:09.670 --> 06:10.804
But, hey, so was I

06:10.838 --> 06:12.973
when you first got your hands
on me, right?

06:13.006 --> 06:14.141
I love it.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.809
It's everything
I've ever wanted.

06:18.479 --> 06:19.680
Guys, they're coming.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.949
I'm out of here.
I got kids.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.551
Yeah, he's so dramatic
about these rats.

06:23.584 --> 06:24.752
It's not a big deal.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.454
I mean, we're doing
construction, but--Oh!

06:26.487 --> 06:29.957
Okay, let's get out of here.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.625
Guys, look who's here.

06:31.659 --> 06:34.495
Hey, bitches.
The Bicoastal Babe is back.

06:34.528 --> 06:35.963
#ItsHappening!

06:35.996 --> 06:37.097
Who's here? Who's here?
Lauren?

06:37.130 --> 06:39.099
Is it Lauren? Is it L--
Oh, it's you.

06:39.132 --> 06:41.469
"It's you"?
That's very rude, Jeremy.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.036
Look, can you not ride me,
please?

06:43.070 --> 06:44.638
If you can't tell
by my loosened Windsor,

06:44.672 --> 06:45.973
I'm going through a lot
right now.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.174
Okay, well...

06:47.207 --> 06:48.642
Hey, girls.

06:48.676 --> 06:50.077
I'm back!
Did you miss me?

06:50.110 --> 06:51.712
You were gone?

06:51.745 --> 06:53.046
Well, of course she was gone.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.948
She was picking up
her Nobel Peace Prize.

06:54.982 --> 06:57.017
Your head healed real nice.

06:58.018 --> 07:00.053
She thinks you're Malala.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.755
Damn it.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.090
Okay, well, great.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.659
Really great to see you.

07:05.693 --> 07:07.027
Oh, hey.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.896
I got about 20 minutes left.

07:08.929 --> 07:12.933
There's a sign-up sheet
over by Dr. Castellano's office.

07:12.966 --> 07:15.469
Oh.

07:15.503 --> 07:16.670
Oh. Whoa!

07:16.704 --> 07:17.738
[thud]
Ow.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.072
(Mindy)
Guys, thanks for doing

07:19.106 --> 07:20.774
all my checkups
simultaneously.

07:20.808 --> 07:22.242
I wanted to do
all my medical appointments

07:22.275 --> 07:23.677
before I went back
to Palo Alto.

07:23.711 --> 07:26.046
My God, your ear is like
a wax museum.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.716
I saw Brad Pitt and
Angelina Jolie statues in there.

07:28.749 --> 07:30.217
I don't need a comedy routine.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.485
[sighs]

07:31.519 --> 07:32.953
What's wrong, Peter?
You seem sad.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.522
You haven't done
that hilarious joke

07:34.555 --> 07:36.123
where you pretend
to find something in there.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.592
I'm actually glad I'm getting
to do this exam on you today

07:38.626 --> 07:41.562
because you're the only one
I can talk to about this.

07:41.595 --> 07:43.263
What?
Do you have a secret?

07:43.296 --> 07:45.533
Ooh.
Your secret's safe-ish with me.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.668
So Lauren's moving back
to Texas today,

07:47.701 --> 07:49.002
but between you and me,

07:49.036 --> 07:51.238
things were just kind of
starting up again.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.806
Starting up how?

07:52.840 --> 07:54.007
They kissed.
I saw the whole thing.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.108
[gasps]
Dude!

07:55.142 --> 07:58.045
Um, your blood pressure
is 1 billion over 1 million.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.080
What's going on, man?
You got to eat better.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.148
I know.
I'm just so stressed.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.282
Do you think you could get me
something to eat?

08:02.315 --> 08:04.885
The breakfast sandwich
with bacon, egg, cheese, ham?

08:04.918 --> 08:06.754
Double bacon, double egg,
double cheese.

08:06.787 --> 08:07.755
Hash browns too?
Yeah.

08:07.788 --> 08:08.756
All right.

08:08.789 --> 08:09.857
Okay, I am sorry

08:09.890 --> 08:11.925
that Lauren is moving to Texas,
but it's her loss.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.661
There's no guys
like you there.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.929
It's all just like oil tycoons
and cowboys

08:15.963 --> 08:17.898
and football players.

08:17.931 --> 08:20.033
Well, I mean,
that sounds pretty--

08:20.067 --> 08:21.034
I don't know.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.069
What about you and Danny?

08:22.102 --> 08:23.904
Things are going well there,
huh?

08:23.937 --> 08:24.972
Well, this is a secret.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.607
I have this amazing opportunity

08:26.640 --> 08:28.709
to start a fertility clinic
in San Francisco.

08:28.742 --> 08:29.977
What?
Yeah.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.211
I just love it there so much.

08:31.244 --> 08:32.846
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

08:32.880 --> 08:33.981
That's a huge move.

08:34.014 --> 08:37.084
I know, but so was moving to
Stanford in the first place.

08:37.117 --> 08:39.653
Believe me, Peter,
life doesn't move in steps.

08:39.687 --> 08:42.022
It moves in huge leaps.

08:42.055 --> 08:44.057
That's a line from
Michelle Kwan's autobiography.

08:44.091 --> 08:48.195
Michelle Kwan's not wrong.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.930
(Peter)
Lauren?
Lauren Neustadter?

08:49.963 --> 08:51.565
Don't board that plane!

08:51.599 --> 08:53.634
Peter?
What are you doing?

08:53.667 --> 08:54.968
How did you get back here?

08:55.002 --> 08:56.670
I bought a $1,000 ticket
to Winnipeg.

08:56.704 --> 08:58.005
Totally worth it.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.873
Can we go somewhere to talk,
please?

08:59.907 --> 09:00.908
But I'm group one.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.242
I get to board early
'cause of Henry.

09:02.275 --> 09:04.712
This is only take a minute,
I swear.

09:04.745 --> 09:07.347
Group one,
passengers with small children.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.683
Mm, o-okay.
Okay.

09:09.717 --> 09:12.786
Lauren, you and I,
I think that we--

09:12.820 --> 09:16.857
Group two, elderly passengers
and active military.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.258
Why not just put that
in group one

09:18.291 --> 09:19.793
if you're gonna move it
that fast?

09:19.827 --> 09:21.629
Look, Lauren,
I know you're not interested

09:21.662 --> 09:22.863
in dating anybody right now.

09:22.896 --> 09:23.964
Yeah.
But if you were just to maybe--

09:23.997 --> 09:25.966
(gate agent)
Now a special boarding
as we welcome

09:25.999 --> 09:28.936
the New York Philharmonic.

09:28.969 --> 09:30.103
There goes your overhead space.

09:30.137 --> 09:32.973
Look, Lauren,
I want to be with you.

09:33.006 --> 09:35.643
Life doesn't move
in small steps.

09:35.676 --> 09:37.878
It moves in leaps.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.681
Peter, this is amazing,
but I am moving to Austin.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.349
I already bought
a split-level ranch

09:42.382 --> 09:43.350
and a book about barbecue.

09:43.383 --> 09:44.417
Wait, wait.

09:44.451 --> 09:47.220
Tell me you don't want me
to go with you,

09:47.254 --> 09:50.157
and I will go.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.659
I can't tell you that.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.894
(gate agent)
This is the final final boarding

09:53.927 --> 09:55.996
for people having a moment.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.230
Oh, come on.
I--I got to go.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.032
They're gonna make me
bag check Henry.

10:00.668 --> 10:02.302
Good-bye, Peter.

10:02.335 --> 10:03.937
Think about it.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.839
Okay.

10:09.810 --> 10:10.811
Bye.

10:16.449 --> 10:17.417
Oh, my God, my baby.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.919
You left--
Yeah.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.220
She was right there.
She was watching. You're fine.

10:20.253 --> 10:21.722
Bye, Peter.
Bye. Bye.

10:21.755 --> 10:22.723
(Lauren)
I'm sorry.

10:22.756 --> 10:23.724
Bye, Henry.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.661
Hey, awesome boyfriend.
Do you have a minute?

10:27.695 --> 10:29.429
I wanted to run something
by you.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.931
Mindy, I told you,
I'm not gonna get an earring.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.165
No, it's--
It's actually--

10:32.199 --> 10:35.002
Guys, I've got some
incredibly major news.

10:35.035 --> 10:35.869
I am effectively quitting

10:35.903 --> 10:39.807
Shulman & Associates
and moving to Texas.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.374
And I want to thank
the one person

10:41.408 --> 10:43.944
that convinced me to keep Austin
weird and follow my heart,

10:43.977 --> 10:45.345
Mindy Lahiri.

10:45.378 --> 10:46.747
What?

10:46.780 --> 10:48.782
I think he's talking to you,
Malala.

10:52.853 --> 10:53.954
What? Wait a minute.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.789
Why on earth would you tell
Peter to leave the practice?

10:55.823 --> 10:56.824
I can't remember anything
that I said.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.025
It was a pap smear.

10:58.058 --> 10:59.259
I was just focusing
on not farting.

10:59.292 --> 11:00.794
Not that focused.
You still farted.

11:00.828 --> 11:03.130
You know, Dr. L also told me
to move to Texas,

11:03.163 --> 11:04.431
but I was like, "No.

11:04.464 --> 11:06.099
I care about
my coworkers too much."

11:06.133 --> 11:07.968
No. No, no, no.
I did not say that.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.302
Oh, yeah,
'cause you haven't been

11:09.336 --> 11:10.971
talking to me for two months.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.873
Tamra, I live in California.

11:12.906 --> 11:15.142
How dare you, Peter?
Chasing after Lauren.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.810
If anybody should be
dropping everything

11:16.844 --> 11:18.145
and moving to Texas,
it's me.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.813
You're gonna go to Texas?

11:19.847 --> 11:20.848
Yes. Yes, I will.

11:20.881 --> 11:23.884
Really?

11:23.917 --> 11:26.754
Do you know, now is--
ugh, it's a bad time.

11:26.787 --> 11:27.620
No, no, no, no.

11:27.654 --> 11:29.757
Pete, why would you abandon us
like this?

11:29.790 --> 11:31.892
We changed you from
an unemployable pervert

11:31.925 --> 11:32.960
to an employable pervert.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.962
And I will never forget that,
and I appreciate it.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.229
Guys, I can't talk
about this anymore.

11:36.263 --> 11:37.998
I got to go find
an apartment in Texas

11:38.031 --> 11:39.967
on the off chance
that Lauren doesn't want me

11:40.000 --> 11:40.868
to move in right away.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.302
Peter--
[door slams]

11:42.335 --> 11:46.106
Okay, people aren't leaving here
willy-nilly like that, okay?

11:46.139 --> 11:47.274
That's not what
we're doing here.

11:47.307 --> 11:48.441
We have a contract.

11:48.475 --> 11:49.843
Unless it's for something
really important

11:49.877 --> 11:50.911
that you feel you must go to.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.279
Absolutely not.

11:52.312 --> 11:53.847
Just because you feel like
doing something

11:53.881 --> 11:54.915
doesn't mean you can.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.283
Is that what you wanted
to tell me?

11:56.316 --> 11:57.918
Mm-hmm. Yep.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.887
That's exactly what I wanted
to tell you.

11:59.920 --> 12:00.954
I'm going to.

12:00.988 --> 12:01.989
What?

12:02.022 --> 12:03.256
Yeah.

12:03.290 --> 12:04.825
I'm gonna go get
a bubble tea.

12:04.858 --> 12:08.028
I never had one before,
but I got to follow my heart.

12:15.903 --> 12:18.906
[cell phone buzzing]

12:21.374 --> 12:23.376
Oh, God.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.145
No. No!

12:25.178 --> 12:28.215
[groans]
Why did I quit my job?

12:28.248 --> 12:30.083
[moans]

12:30.117 --> 12:32.219
Oh, Gurgler. Oh.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.988
You did it again, Gurgler.
You did it again.

12:35.022 --> 12:38.525
(Mindy)
Look, I know my going-away party
for Peter is unpopular.

12:38.558 --> 12:41.561
However, I do think that the
comments on the online invite

12:41.594 --> 12:42.963
were excessively rude.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.898
Sorry, I always speak my mind.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.967
You look bad today.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.136
I look like freakin'
Spring Awakening right now.

12:49.169 --> 12:50.871
I threaten to quit
almost every week,

12:50.904 --> 12:52.472
and you never throw me
a going-away party.

12:52.505 --> 12:54.007
Except a couple times.

12:54.041 --> 12:56.076
Okay, Peter didn't do
anything wrong, you guys.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.311
I think him moving for the life
he wants is kind of brave.

12:58.345 --> 12:59.913
Or selfish.

12:59.947 --> 13:01.148
(Jeremy)
You know what
the brave thing would be,

13:01.181 --> 13:02.215
would be not to follow
your girlfriend

13:02.249 --> 13:04.084
and instead staying true
to the condo lease agreement

13:04.117 --> 13:05.886
you signed the year before.

13:05.919 --> 13:06.920
Daniel.

13:09.456 --> 13:10.590
You know what I think's brave?

13:10.623 --> 13:12.025
Asking your boss for a raise

13:12.059 --> 13:14.027
in front of
your fellow employees.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.831
[upbeat party music]

13:17.865 --> 13:21.101
[indistinct chatter]

13:21.134 --> 13:24.037
*

13:24.071 --> 13:25.072
Mindy?

13:25.105 --> 13:26.974
I am so sorry,

13:27.007 --> 13:29.509
but I just caught two of
my friends doing drugs

13:29.542 --> 13:31.044
off of this picture
of your parents.

13:31.078 --> 13:32.279
Oh, my God.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.546
Why are you in here all alone?

13:33.580 --> 13:34.614
What's going on?

13:34.647 --> 13:36.283
Did Pube do something to you?

13:36.316 --> 13:37.450
No.

13:37.484 --> 13:38.585
I mean, he grabbed my ass,
I like that.

13:38.618 --> 13:41.922
Peter, I'm just sad
that I can't even talk to Danny

13:41.955 --> 13:43.991
about wanting to take this job
in San Francisco.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.893
I mean, look at how
he reacted to your news.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.194
He didn't even show up
to the party.

13:47.227 --> 13:48.361
And that's just you.

13:48.395 --> 13:51.531
Tough to hear it
phrased that way,

13:51.564 --> 13:53.133
but I understand
what you're saying.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.134
I'm sorry.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.268
A part of me feels guilty

13:55.302 --> 13:56.436
for even wanting any of this.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.171
Up until now,
all I've ever wanted

13:58.205 --> 13:59.572
was to live in Manhattan
with Danny

13:59.606 --> 14:01.208
and our 12 daughters.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.609
We'd have a reality show called

14:02.642 --> 14:05.212
Keeping Up With
The Castellanos Plus Lahiri.

14:05.245 --> 14:07.014
Hmm.
It's a long title.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.917
Yeah.
But, look, Mindy.

14:09.950 --> 14:12.019
You're allowed to change
what they want in life.

14:12.052 --> 14:15.923
People do it all the time.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.657
But you know what I would do
is, I would tell Danny.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.927
Just be honest with him.
He loves you.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.328
He'll understand.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.530
*

14:26.934 --> 14:28.635
Still here?
Hey, pal.

14:28.668 --> 14:30.637
Let me guess.
You're skipping the party too?

14:30.670 --> 14:32.339
Yeah, of course I am.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.342
The gall of Peter,
leaving us all in the lurch.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.643
Who does he think he is?

14:36.676 --> 14:40.047
Father? Mother?

14:40.080 --> 14:41.648
Yeah, well, you never have to
worry about that from me, okay?

14:41.681 --> 14:43.951
I never bail on responsibility.

14:43.984 --> 14:46.920
I still go upstate to water
a tree I planted at camp.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.188
Yeah, of course.
We're gonna be fine.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.090
We'll be fine.
How are we gonna replace Peter?

14:50.123 --> 14:52.960
Who's gonna insert a photo
of his bottom

14:52.993 --> 14:54.127
into my slide presentations?

14:54.161 --> 14:55.963
Or when he hands me
my breakfast banana

14:55.996 --> 14:56.964
from his zipper.

14:56.997 --> 14:59.232
He just--
[snickers]

14:59.266 --> 15:01.501
What an idiot.
[laughing]

15:01.534 --> 15:03.070
You know, there's a chance
without Pete,

15:03.103 --> 15:05.305
Mindy and I wouldn't
be together right now.

15:09.977 --> 15:12.579
(Peter)
I want to thank everybody
so much for coming tonight.

15:12.612 --> 15:13.480
I know a lot of you canceled

15:13.513 --> 15:15.382
some very important plans
to be here.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.583
Yeah, no kidding.

15:16.616 --> 15:17.484
When I first got to New York,

15:17.517 --> 15:21.454
I was a chubby, jerky,
immature loser.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.290
I would cry all night
in front of my computer.

15:23.323 --> 15:25.658
My only solace, a hand.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.127
Maybe two.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.429
Hear, hear.
To groundin' and poundin'.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.298
You know what I'm saying.
Oh, God.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.266
Anyway, then something
awesome happened,

15:33.300 --> 15:35.302
something life-changing:

15:35.335 --> 15:38.005
a group of really cool
vaginistas took me in.

15:38.038 --> 15:38.938
Is he talking about

15:38.972 --> 15:40.407
just the doctors
or also the support staff?

15:40.440 --> 15:41.408
Shh!

15:41.441 --> 15:42.742
Your "shh" was much louder
than me.

15:42.775 --> 15:43.943
Shhhh!

15:43.977 --> 15:46.513
Anyway, I never do this, but
I want to single someone out,

15:46.546 --> 15:48.515
someone who means
so much to me.

15:48.548 --> 15:49.983
Mindy Lahiri.

15:50.017 --> 15:51.985
I don't think I'd be here today
without you.

15:52.019 --> 15:53.987
You have shown me so--

15:54.021 --> 15:56.123
Hey, cool!
Danny and Jeremy came.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.290
Oh, hey, guys.
What's up?

15:57.324 --> 15:58.558
I was just--
it doesn't matter.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.260
What's going on?
Oh, it's so good to see you.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.428
Hey, man.

16:01.461 --> 16:02.495
I am so happy
you guys came.

16:02.529 --> 16:03.496
Thank you.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.598
Hey, look,
you're a great friend,

16:05.632 --> 16:07.200
and you should do
whatever you need to do.

16:07.234 --> 16:08.668
And Jeremy and Mindy and I,

16:08.701 --> 16:10.703
we're gonna hold down
the practice.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.039
(Mindy)
Now tell him you love him.

16:12.072 --> 16:14.507
Tell him that you'll love him
forever.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.076
Yeah, I think the sentiment
is covered.

16:16.109 --> 16:18.145
I don't do that.
Just tell him.

16:18.178 --> 16:19.746
I get it. We get it.
"Bon voyage"?

16:19.779 --> 16:21.781
Mindy!
You decided to do it?

16:21.814 --> 16:23.016
Oh, thank God.

16:23.050 --> 16:26.486
I already sent a really gloating
email to my alumni magazine.

16:26.519 --> 16:27.720
Wait, Ron.
Why would you do that?

16:27.754 --> 16:30.223
Because life moves in leaps,
not steps.

16:30.257 --> 16:32.225
Haven't you read
Michelle Kwan's autobiography?

16:32.259 --> 16:33.760
We cannot do this here
right now, okay?

16:33.793 --> 16:34.761
Wait a minute. Wait.

16:34.794 --> 16:37.164
Do--do what?

16:37.197 --> 16:38.498
You, me, and Mindy

16:38.531 --> 16:40.433
starting a practice
in San Francisco, huh?

16:40.467 --> 16:43.636
[laughs]
I'm so happy.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.272
[plastic cup clatters]

16:45.305 --> 16:46.339
Oh!
Oh, my God!

16:49.376 --> 16:50.810
(Morgan)
Dr. L, if you are going
to San Francisco,

16:50.843 --> 16:52.612
what can you offer me
in terms of relocation package?

16:52.645 --> 16:54.647
Mindy and I aren't moving
to San Francisco.

16:54.681 --> 16:55.782
Is this a prank?

16:55.815 --> 16:57.684
San Francisco is the worst...

16:57.717 --> 16:58.751
[all agreeing]

16:58.785 --> 17:00.820
Because of all the Chinese.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.589
You said it. Wait. No, no, no.
[all murmuring]

17:02.622 --> 17:04.257
No, San Francisco
is not the worst.

17:04.291 --> 17:06.359
It's beautiful,
and it's inspiring.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.228
And it's made me my best self.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.597
I'm a better leader.
I'm kinder.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.399
[all boo]

17:12.432 --> 17:14.101
Okay, shut the hell up,
trash.

17:14.134 --> 17:16.203
Okay, just leave her alone,
okay?

17:16.236 --> 17:18.138
I'm sorry San Francisco
doesn't have everything

17:18.171 --> 17:19.772
New York does,
with your bedbugs,

17:19.806 --> 17:22.609
your cold, your pathetic excuse
for a Chinatown.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.244
Yeah, our dim sum's
incomparable.

17:24.277 --> 17:27.247
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Fight! Fight! Go! Go!

17:27.280 --> 17:29.816
[New York accent]
So youse two have been
planning this behind my back?

17:29.849 --> 17:31.584
Oh, no, Danny.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.520
You only talk ethnic
when you're really furious.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.855
Okay, listen, I was going to
tell you, I promise.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.424
You don't really want to
do this, do you?

17:37.457 --> 17:38.425
Maybe.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.193
Yeah, I mean, at least
I want to talk about it.

17:40.227 --> 17:43.530
I bought us a house.
I know.

17:47.667 --> 17:48.701
Good job,
guy from San Francisco.

17:48.735 --> 17:51.304
You made Danny leave my party.
He just got here.

17:53.806 --> 17:57.210
Well, enjoy the West Coast.

17:57.244 --> 17:58.745
I'd like to have
everyone's attention.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.813
I am also moving.

18:00.847 --> 18:05.418
I am moving from the basement
of my grandmother's house

18:05.452 --> 18:06.453
to the attic.

18:12.359 --> 18:13.860
Hey, dude.
What's up?

18:13.893 --> 18:14.727
Hey.

18:14.761 --> 18:17.197
How'd you know
which brownstone was ours?

18:17.230 --> 18:19.466
Oh, there's a tiny rivulet
of sweat

18:19.499 --> 18:20.900
running out to the street.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.769
So you want to tell me
what that wall did to you?

18:22.802 --> 18:24.371
Hey, man,
I don't understand.

18:24.404 --> 18:25.538
Why is she moving away?

18:25.572 --> 18:26.739
She wants to get away from me?

18:26.773 --> 18:28.875
No, dude,
the girl's obsessed with you.

18:28.908 --> 18:31.311
She has a mold
of your penis as her keychain.

18:31.344 --> 18:34.481
I think this fertility clinic is
just a big opportunity for her,

18:34.514 --> 18:35.815
for the practice,
and for you.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.350
Well, not for me.
I mean, I live here.

18:37.384 --> 18:39.352
I live in New York.
This is my home.

18:39.386 --> 18:41.188
Home is where
the person you love is.

18:41.221 --> 18:42.589
That's why
I'm moving to Texas.

18:44.824 --> 18:47.527
Now can I please...

18:47.560 --> 18:49.196
Yeah.
Thank you.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.372
Okay, no--
[both shouting]

18:59.406 --> 19:01.574
All right, give me a bucket!

19:01.608 --> 19:03.710
No!
What? I'm helping you.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.878
Cover it!

19:05.912 --> 19:07.914
I'm trying!
I--

19:11.918 --> 19:13.820
What's up?

19:13.853 --> 19:15.788
Hey.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.357
Oh, God.

19:17.390 --> 19:18.725
Did you inhale these again?

19:18.758 --> 19:21.228
I know, I just thought
an apology would be funnier

19:21.261 --> 19:22.729
if I did it in
my Mickey Mouse voice.

19:22.762 --> 19:23.830
[high-pitched]
Hey, Danny.

19:23.863 --> 19:26.499
I'm sorry you thought I was
gonna go to San Francisco.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.470
[normal voice]
I don't know what to do, Danny.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.239
I know that you'll never
move to San Francisco,

19:32.272 --> 19:33.706
but I'm also worried that

19:33.740 --> 19:36.576
I'm gonna regret it for the rest
of my life if I don't do it.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.245
I get it, people change.

19:38.278 --> 19:39.846
I mean, there are so many things
I couldn't picture myself

19:39.879 --> 19:42.949
doing or liking
before I met you.

19:42.982 --> 19:45.752
And that's why I love you.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.920
But I can only change
so much.

19:47.954 --> 19:51.924
Anyway, you wouldn't like me
if I became a different person.

19:51.958 --> 19:52.859
You wouldn't like me.

19:52.892 --> 19:55.628
You're right.

19:55.662 --> 19:59.899
So what do we do?

19:59.932 --> 20:02.902
[gentle guitar music]

20:02.935 --> 20:04.871
*

20:04.904 --> 20:06.373
I don't know.

20:09.776 --> 20:12.279
I don't know.

20:12.312 --> 20:16.483
* April

20:16.516 --> 20:19.018
* Come she will

20:19.051 --> 20:25.024
* When streams are ripe
and swelled with rain *

20:25.057 --> 20:31.831
* May, she will stay

20:31.864 --> 20:36.869
* The autumn winds blow
chilly and cold *

20:36.903 --> 20:43.643
* September,
I'll remember *

20:43.676 --> 20:50.883
* A love once new has now
grown old *

20:50.917 --> 20:52.852
*

20:52.885 --> 20:56.956
[phone rings]

20:56.989 --> 20:58.057
Hey, Peter.

20:58.090 --> 20:58.958
I was gonna call you.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.993
I feel like
I didn't get to say good-bye.

21:01.027 --> 21:03.396
Yeah, I'm sorry
I ghosted back there.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.898
I just--
I thought it would be too hard.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.300
You're kind of
my best friend.

21:07.334 --> 21:08.801
Oh, my God.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.703
I think you're
my best friend too.

21:10.737 --> 21:12.339
You know,
I'm also your doctor,

21:12.372 --> 21:13.973
and your lab results came back.

21:14.006 --> 21:15.608
Oh, no.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.377
Peter, I could have gotten it
from anywhere.

21:17.410 --> 21:18.411
I used a gas station toilet.

21:18.445 --> 21:20.613
I wore a bathing suit
that I found in the street.

21:20.647 --> 21:22.582
No, dummy.

21:22.615 --> 21:23.783
You're pregnant.

21:27.687 --> 21:28.555
Exsqueeze me?

21:28.588 --> 21:32.459
[imitating Borat]
Very nice, my child.

21:32.492 --> 21:34.527
[normal voice]
I mean, it's--it's not mine.

21:34.561 --> 21:36.763
Is it? I'm just kidding.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.865
It's Danny's? I hope?

21:38.898 --> 21:41.000
Okay, tell me how it happened.
But wait.

21:41.033 --> 21:42.869
I want to hit record
on my phone.
