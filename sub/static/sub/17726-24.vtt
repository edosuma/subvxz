WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:04.138
- Tonight
the dramatic conclusion

00:04.172 --> 00:05.573
of the "Vanderpump Rules"
reunion.

00:05.606 --> 00:07.475
- You guys were both
in such bad places

00:07.508 --> 00:08.576
that maybe
you should call it off.

00:08.609 --> 00:10.078
- Come on.

00:10.111 --> 00:11.412
- Not once
are you guys telling Katie

00:11.445 --> 00:13.081
that she needs to do anything.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.315
You guys spent
the entire summer

00:14.348 --> 00:17.051
licking her f---ing ass----.

00:17.085 --> 00:18.152
- Kristen,
when we were together,

00:18.186 --> 00:19.387
all you used to praise about

00:19.420 --> 00:21.489
was how f---ing talented
I was.

00:21.522 --> 00:22.490
Shut your mouth;
you're irrelevant.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.058
Shut up!
Shut up!

00:24.092 --> 00:25.126
- Okay, guys, guys.

00:25.159 --> 00:26.560
[all talking]
Guys, hold on.

00:26.594 --> 00:29.097
- All I remember is being like,
"Did you just say

00:29.130 --> 00:30.298
I f---ing looked like Sia?"

00:30.331 --> 00:33.267
And I'm like, "They're fighting
about Sia in the hallway."

00:33.301 --> 00:34.535
It was--it was incredible.

00:34.568 --> 00:37.471
- I got tweets saying,
"Ariana's anti-drag

00:37.505 --> 00:39.373
is giving me
James Kennedy vibes."

00:39.407 --> 00:41.375
- Pooping in a dress on TV--

00:41.409 --> 00:43.211
did this ruin
your bachelor party?

00:43.244 --> 00:45.113
- You would think it would have.

00:45.146 --> 00:46.514
- Scheana, in a few minutes,

00:46.547 --> 00:49.183
your ex-husband, Mike Shay,
is gonna be joining us.

00:49.217 --> 00:51.385
- [tearfully]
I don't want to see him.

00:51.419 --> 00:54.155
- Oh, my God, the way
she spoke about you to me--

00:54.188 --> 00:55.289
- Okay, Lisa.

00:55.323 --> 00:57.158
- I never could quite
understand it.

00:57.191 --> 00:59.593
- You having a new boyfriend
is very quick.

00:59.627 --> 01:01.429
- Are you seeing anyone?

01:01.462 --> 01:02.563
- No.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.598
I'm still technically married.

01:04.632 --> 01:06.867
- Part three of
the "Vanderpump Rules" reunion

01:06.900 --> 01:08.369
starts now.

01:08.402 --> 01:12.440
- * Just raise
your glasses high *

01:12.473 --> 01:15.176
* This one's for you tonight

01:15.209 --> 01:16.277
- Hey, everyone.

01:16.310 --> 01:17.345
Welcome to
the "Vanderpump Rules"

01:17.378 --> 01:18.846
season five reunion.

01:18.879 --> 01:22.450
We're back with Lisa Vanderpump
and the staff of Sur.

01:22.483 --> 01:25.586
Stassi, any guys
on the horizon for you?

01:25.619 --> 01:27.488
- No, I feel like a loser.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.290
- Aw!
- Set me up.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.292
- When you and Peter
made out in New Orleans,

01:31.325 --> 01:33.327
I kind of felt like...

01:33.361 --> 01:34.495
- Possibility?

01:34.528 --> 01:37.331
- Something was gonna be
rekindled there.

01:37.365 --> 01:39.700
[people cheering]
- Oh, my God.

01:39.733 --> 01:42.436
[women cheering]

01:42.470 --> 01:44.205
- Oh, Peter.

01:44.238 --> 01:46.240
- We were really hoping for--
- It looked like a nice kiss.

01:46.274 --> 01:48.709
- Oh, no, Peter and I
kiss well together,

01:48.742 --> 01:50.311
so, like, that worked out.

01:50.344 --> 01:52.380
- Were you sucking up
to the manager

01:52.413 --> 01:54.182
to get your old job back?

01:54.215 --> 01:55.349
[laughter]

01:55.383 --> 01:56.384
- Like that's gonna happen.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.352
- I want to talk
about New Orleans.

01:58.386 --> 01:59.587
Whose idea was it

01:59.620 --> 02:02.156
to have a joint
bachelor-bachelorette party?

02:02.190 --> 02:04.292
- We thought it'd be fun
to do a trip together

02:04.325 --> 02:06.460
so we could all hang out
and celebrate together.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.629
- Alcohol, group trip--
what could go wrong?

02:08.662 --> 02:09.730
- Yeah, right.

02:09.763 --> 02:11.399
Brittany,
is it a Kentucky thing

02:11.432 --> 02:13.501
to do shots out of
your boyfriend's mouth?

02:13.534 --> 02:14.935
- [laughs]

02:14.968 --> 02:17.171
I didn't remember that
until I saw that, so...

02:17.205 --> 02:18.572
No, it's not.
It's definitely not.

02:18.606 --> 02:19.640
And I kind of thought
that was gross

02:19.673 --> 02:20.641
when I watched it.

02:20.674 --> 02:21.642
- Did we do that?

02:21.675 --> 02:23.477
- You fed me a Jell-O shot.

02:23.511 --> 02:25.279
Ew!

02:26.347 --> 02:28.682
- Oh, classic.
- Katie, you said in New Orleans

02:28.716 --> 02:30.918
that the reason that you
and Schwartz fight so much

02:30.951 --> 02:33.487
is because of Tom and Ariana.

02:33.521 --> 02:36.390
- A lot of our fights
were about the dynamics

02:36.424 --> 02:38.359
and arguments
within our friend group,

02:38.392 --> 02:40.461
and that had caused, like,
a big rift.

02:40.494 --> 02:41.729
And so I just wanted harmony.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.664
I wasn't trying to be
a tyrant or Bridezilla;

02:43.697 --> 02:45.299
I just really wanted
harmony.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.400
I was trying
to be rude to people.

02:46.434 --> 02:47.968
I was under a serious amount
of stress.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.537
- Well, when I got
that text message...

02:49.570 --> 02:51.272
- She said, "I'm tired
of fighting

02:51.305 --> 02:53.674
"and defending myself
against y'all with my fiancÃ©.

02:53.707 --> 02:56.310
"Jesus Christ,
get over yourselves.

02:56.344 --> 02:59.313
"We fight solely about him
defending the two of you.

02:59.347 --> 03:00.481
I'm very over it."

03:00.514 --> 03:01.749
- I mean, at that moment,

03:01.782 --> 03:03.317
that's what we were
arguing about the most.

03:03.351 --> 03:04.552
- Should put an asterisk.

03:04.585 --> 03:05.986
- The littlest things
can set somebody off

03:06.019 --> 03:08.722
if there's deeper issues,
right?

03:08.756 --> 03:10.291
- They were just
surface triggers

03:10.324 --> 03:11.625
for, you know,
deeper root issues

03:11.659 --> 03:13.427
that we have been working on

03:13.461 --> 03:15.496
and I'm sure most of you guys,
all you guys know about.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.765
- I wasn't trying to tell you,
like, what you should do.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.233
I was telling you

03:19.267 --> 03:21.635
to talk to somebody
who's nonbiased.

03:21.669 --> 03:24.572
- No offense, but the
only person in this room

03:24.605 --> 03:27.441
I would take relationship
advice from is Lisa.

03:27.475 --> 03:28.742
- Jax, for the first time,

03:28.776 --> 03:31.812
we saw you really apologize
and break down

03:31.845 --> 03:34.715
for the man that you were
when you dated Stassi.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.717
- I am sorry.
I was a different person then.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.386
I was a f---ing
piece of sh--.

03:38.419 --> 03:39.620
I was an asshole.
I was a cheater.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.455
I was a liar.
I was a stealer.

03:41.489 --> 03:43.591
I'm sorry.

03:43.624 --> 03:47.361
- It actually meant more than
I think people would think.

03:47.395 --> 03:49.763
It wasn't the cheating.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.732
That wasn't
what the problem was.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.734
It was the fact that it then
trickled down

03:53.767 --> 03:56.537
into my relationship
and my friendships.

03:56.570 --> 04:01.342
So much happened because of
things that he did in the past,

04:01.375 --> 04:04.412
and to hear him own
that part of it,

04:04.445 --> 04:06.814
I was like, "Yes.
Okay, finally."

04:06.847 --> 04:12.520
- You know, Brittany,
I've seen Jax boss you around

04:12.553 --> 04:15.756
and telling everyone that
Kristen was going down on you,

04:15.789 --> 04:17.758
walking out on your mom.

04:17.791 --> 04:20.761
And here he is,
pouring his heart out to Stassi.

04:20.794 --> 04:22.330
How did that make you feel,

04:22.363 --> 04:26.066
given things that he's said
and done to you?

04:26.099 --> 04:29.069
- What hurt me was that
he is so hard to admit

04:29.102 --> 04:30.771
whenever he's done
something wrong.

04:30.804 --> 04:34.408
And it's really hard for him
to sincerely apologize to me

04:34.442 --> 04:36.744
and own up to things
that he knows hurts me.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.347
- I think, too, is the amount
of emotion he had.

04:39.380 --> 04:40.848
- Yeah.
- We were all wasted.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.516
- Yeah, but I'm saying
even when they're wasted,

04:42.550 --> 04:44.084
it's not like he cries
and apologizes to her

04:44.117 --> 04:45.453
for treating her like sh--.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.355
- And I cried to Scheana
right after

04:47.388 --> 04:49.557
just because it was weird
for me to witness it

04:49.590 --> 04:51.792
whenever I want those same kind
of emotions

04:51.825 --> 04:53.661
and I want those same kind
of apologizes.

04:53.694 --> 04:54.828
- I'm sorry.
I apologize.

04:54.862 --> 04:55.896
Maybe I should have
pulled her aside

04:55.929 --> 04:57.531
without you watching,

04:57.565 --> 04:58.899
but I feel like it was just--
at that time, I thought,

04:58.932 --> 05:00.801
"You know what?
Let's just do this."

05:00.834 --> 05:02.069
- What came over you?

05:02.102 --> 05:03.437
- I think
since dating Brittany,

05:03.471 --> 05:04.738
like, I've definitely become
a better person,

05:04.772 --> 05:06.740
and one of the things
that I've wanted to do

05:06.774 --> 05:08.509
is try to better myself.

05:08.542 --> 05:10.478
A lot of water has been
under the bridge now,

05:10.511 --> 05:11.845
and I feel like
we're at a point now

05:11.879 --> 05:14.382
where I can, you know,
sit down and talk

05:14.415 --> 05:15.516
and say I'm sorry.

05:15.549 --> 05:18.118
- Schwartz, it's hard to say
who was angrier with you

05:18.151 --> 05:20.087
in New Orleans,
Katie or your liver.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.889
- Oh, God.
- Were you ever not drinking?

05:21.922 --> 05:23.424
[rock music pounding]

05:23.457 --> 05:26.860
*

05:26.894 --> 05:28.429
- [burps loudly]

05:28.462 --> 05:29.797
*

05:29.830 --> 05:32.332
- What is this?
I'm gonna drink it.

05:33.401 --> 05:34.602
[babbling]

05:34.635 --> 05:35.703
- Wow.

05:35.736 --> 05:36.837
- I was on the verge
of blacking out

05:36.870 --> 05:38.772
for, like, 80% to 90%
of the trip.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.474
- But he knows
everything that happened

05:40.508 --> 05:41.509
and who started the fight.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.577
- I wasn't blacked out;
I was, like, browned out.

05:43.611 --> 05:44.812
- It was a brown-out.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.914
- Remember, he would stay up--
- Guys.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.916
The thing is,
I'm a trained professional.

05:48.949 --> 05:51.719
Like, I'm a happy-go-lucky--
I'm a good drinker.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.487
- You were going through it,
and you were just,

05:53.521 --> 05:55.723
you know, taking it out
on Coors Light.

05:55.756 --> 05:57.458
[laughs]
And you definitely did.

05:57.491 --> 05:58.559
- Did you think
there was no hope

05:58.592 --> 05:59.727
for him and Katie
at that point?

05:59.760 --> 06:02.730
- I just--and--
[sighs]

06:02.763 --> 06:05.132
I've never seen him crying
and upset.

06:05.165 --> 06:07.935
Like, he was on a--
he was on a tear,

06:07.968 --> 06:10.170
just drinking, drinking,
just kind of like--

06:10.203 --> 06:11.104
he almost looked like
he was lost,

06:11.138 --> 06:12.740
like he almost wanted
to throw in the towel.

06:12.773 --> 06:14.442
Like, "You're gonna
hurt yourself."

06:14.475 --> 06:15.709
Like, it was getting to that.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.478
- That's coming
from Jax too.

06:17.511 --> 06:18.579
- [laughs]
- No, I was just kind of--

06:18.612 --> 06:19.547
I stepped back.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.682
- Ariana, were you surprised
that the groomsmen

06:21.715 --> 06:22.683
were so emotional?

06:22.716 --> 06:23.717
You went gator viewing,

06:23.751 --> 06:26.487
and Sandoval's in tears.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.822
- I just--I'm just--

06:28.856 --> 06:30.491
I don't want to see you
like this, man.

06:30.524 --> 06:31.925
You f---ing deserve better,
dude.

06:31.959 --> 06:35.195
- There's no crying
at the bachelor party!

06:35.228 --> 06:37.164
- Look, maybe at, like,
a dinner

06:37.197 --> 06:38.632
or maybe, like,
a sit-down thing,

06:38.666 --> 06:40.167
they would, like, bro out
and have those moments.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.636
But, like, at the gator hunt?

06:42.670 --> 06:45.839
Like, just really probably
the most unexpected thing

06:45.873 --> 06:47.441
I thought of
when I woke up that morning.

06:47.475 --> 06:49.643
- I'm curious;
Katie, what was your reaction

06:49.677 --> 06:50.844
when you saw that expedition?

06:50.878 --> 06:52.980
You've got Schwartz
super drunk,

06:53.013 --> 06:54.815
Jax saying, "Don't marry her."

06:54.848 --> 06:55.983
He's breaking down.

06:56.016 --> 06:58.519
What was your reaction to that?

06:58.552 --> 07:01.522
- It was--it was
a little bizarre to me,

07:01.555 --> 07:03.190
'cause I'm like, "Wow,
these are people

07:03.223 --> 07:05.659
"that I thought were my friends
as well,

07:05.693 --> 07:07.194
that maybe had my interests."

07:07.227 --> 07:08.295
But it didn't really feel
that way.

07:08.328 --> 07:10.197
It just felt like,
"Poor Schwartz, poor Schwartz,"

07:10.230 --> 07:12.199
as if, like, I had actually

07:12.232 --> 07:14.201
beaten and battered him
all the time.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.836
- You guys were both
in such bad places

07:15.869 --> 07:17.538
that maybe you should
push it back--

07:17.571 --> 07:18.806
- But it takes two to tango.

07:18.839 --> 07:19.840
- It takes two to tango.
Correct.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.510
Maybe you should call it off
and just push it back.

07:22.543 --> 07:23.944
It wasn't that I--
"Oh, God, Katie sucks.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.145
Whatever.
You shouldn't marry--"

07:25.178 --> 07:27.481
It was kind of like, "Dude,
if you're going through all this

07:27.515 --> 07:28.716
"and she's going through
all this,

07:28.749 --> 07:29.817
maybe you should
push it back a little bit."

07:29.850 --> 07:32.219
- That makes sense,
but that's not what was said.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.787
- I understand,
but that's what I meant.

07:33.821 --> 07:36.490
- When I said that,
I had witnessed months

07:36.524 --> 07:39.259
and months and months
of you guys arguing

07:39.292 --> 07:41.929
and then Kristen walking
up to Schwartz and me like,

07:41.962 --> 07:44.832
"When Katie gets like this,
you just need to go like this."

07:44.865 --> 07:46.867
You going like, "Sometimes
you just need to give her a hug,

07:46.900 --> 07:48.569
"and you need to do this,
and you need to do this"--

07:48.602 --> 07:49.837
- Because we know how
to handle Katie.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.705
- And not f---ing once,
not once

07:51.739 --> 07:54.575
are you guys telling Katie
that she needs to do anything.

07:54.608 --> 07:55.843
You guys spent the entire summer

07:55.876 --> 07:59.479
literally licking
her f---ing ass----.

08:00.548 --> 08:01.749
- Like, come on.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.584
- The drag night
was a huge hit.

08:03.617 --> 08:06.587
Schwartz, why did you want
to dress in drag, again?

08:06.620 --> 08:07.755
- I'm just curious by nature,

08:07.788 --> 08:09.623
and it's something
I always wanted to do.

08:09.657 --> 08:13.527
[upbeat rock music]

08:13.561 --> 08:15.062
- Oh!
Oh ho ho!

08:15.095 --> 08:17.531
- Oh, God.
- I couldn't handle her.

08:17.565 --> 08:18.699
- Whoo!
- Love you.

08:18.732 --> 08:19.933
- Classy lady.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.034
*

08:21.068 --> 08:23.003
- I got to go.
I got sh-- to do.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.772
- Bye.

08:24.805 --> 08:27.074
- Lisa, who made
the prettiest drag queen?

08:27.107 --> 08:28.976
- Oh, Sandoval.
- Sandoval?

08:29.009 --> 08:30.611
- Yeah, Jax was horrific.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.045
- They committed so hard.

08:32.079 --> 08:33.647
I have never laughed so hard.

08:33.681 --> 08:34.915
- No, he should have
changed his face.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.617
- You know what?
He went all the way.

08:36.650 --> 08:37.818
Like, I give him that.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.887
But, I mean, he went as far as--
he even got all our outfits.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.589
- What was your drag name?

08:41.622 --> 08:42.623
- Jordan Tyler.

08:42.656 --> 08:44.291
- I like Jordan Tyler.

08:44.324 --> 08:45.759
- I do too.
- He's so cringy.

08:45.793 --> 08:46.860
He's an asshole.

08:46.894 --> 08:48.962
- I swear, I got tweets
saying, like,

08:48.996 --> 08:50.898
"Ariana's, like, anti-drag

08:50.931 --> 08:52.866
is giving me
James Kennedy vibes."

08:52.900 --> 08:53.934
[laughter]

08:53.967 --> 08:56.637
So I was just like,
"What the hell?"

08:56.670 --> 08:57.805
- It was such a big hit.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.607
Everyone was having
such a good time

08:59.640 --> 09:01.975
that Kristen thought
it would be a great moment

09:02.009 --> 09:04.645
to sit Schwartz down

09:04.678 --> 09:08.649
and accuse him of sleeping
with the Vegas girl.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.918
- At my bachelorette--
our bachelor-bachelorette party,

09:10.951 --> 09:13.787
it was, like,
just the poorest taste possible.

09:13.821 --> 09:15.689
- But at the end of the day,
they were sort of forced

09:15.723 --> 09:17.591
to talk through it,
and they did.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.660
And would they have ever?
Maybe not.

09:19.693 --> 09:20.894
Had we all gone back home,

09:20.928 --> 09:22.630
they would have kept
ignoring it.

09:22.663 --> 09:23.664
- Right, but it didn't
have to be--

09:23.697 --> 09:24.598
- So I caused
a sh-- show.

09:24.632 --> 09:25.666
- It didn't have to be,
like, in the hallway

09:25.699 --> 09:28.936
so everyone who's sleeping
in their beds could hear.

09:28.969 --> 09:30.704
- Well, it wasn't.
I pulled him out on the patio.

09:30.738 --> 09:31.939
[people talking at once]

09:31.972 --> 09:33.340
- We were trying to get
away from you, Kristen.

09:33.373 --> 09:34.675
- Don't say "we," Tom.

09:34.708 --> 09:35.809
It had nothing to do
with you. Stop.

09:35.843 --> 09:36.810
You are not
Schwartz's bodyguard.

09:36.844 --> 09:37.811
You are not Schwartz.

09:37.845 --> 09:39.780
- He's my best friend,
and you're attacking him

09:39.813 --> 09:41.882
on his bachelor party,
and all I'm trying to do

09:41.915 --> 09:44.151
is alleviate the fight
and get him in the elevator.

09:44.184 --> 09:45.686
- I did not attack him.

09:45.719 --> 09:46.954
- You said,
"I know for a fact

09:46.987 --> 09:49.657
you f---ed that girl
in Vegas."

09:49.690 --> 09:50.824
- Oh, God.

09:50.858 --> 09:53.827
[dramatic music]

09:54.928 --> 09:56.396
- Scheana, in a few minutes,

09:56.429 --> 09:58.799
your ex-husband, Mike Shay,
is gonna be joining us.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.834
- I'm, like, scared for him
to be around all of us.

10:00.868 --> 10:02.636
- [tearfully]
I don't want to see him.

10:06.707 --> 10:09.643
[light music]

10:09.677 --> 10:10.744
- Did I attack him?

10:10.778 --> 10:12.379
- You said,
"I know for a fact

10:12.412 --> 10:13.814
you f---ed that girl
in Vegas."

10:13.847 --> 10:16.016
- You are more offended
by this than anyone.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.117
That's the crazy part.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.185
- You should have let him go,

10:18.218 --> 10:20.320
and you followed him
and continued to follow him.

10:20.353 --> 10:23.824
And when you corner somebody,
that's when they f---ing react.

10:23.857 --> 10:26.093
- Stassi, you were
eavesdropping.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.327
What did it look like to you?

10:27.360 --> 10:30.998
- I'm in bed, and I hear
yelling in the hallway.

10:31.031 --> 10:34.735
And I go out, and I see
two guys dressed as women

10:34.768 --> 10:37.004
fighting about looking like Sia.

10:37.037 --> 10:39.306
- Everybody f---ing grows up,
Tom, and guess what.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.374
You grew up to be f---ing Sia.

10:41.408 --> 10:42.843
- Okay.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.411
- You guys--honestly,
you guys should date.

10:44.444 --> 10:45.412
This is ridiculous.

10:45.445 --> 10:46.780
- All right.
- All right.

10:46.814 --> 10:48.415
- Carter--
- He's going for the digs.

10:48.448 --> 10:49.750
- Carter--
- He's going for the digs.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.118
You grew up,
and you became Sia.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.252
- Carter, you're thinking
with your--

10:52.285 --> 10:54.087
- No, you grew up,
and you became Sia.

10:54.121 --> 10:56.256
- All I remember is being like,
"Did you just say

10:56.289 --> 10:58.058
I f---ing looked like Sia?"

10:58.091 --> 11:00.828
And I'm like, "They're fighting
about Sia in the hallway."

11:00.861 --> 11:01.929
It was--it was incredible.

11:01.962 --> 11:04.031
- Schwartz, you went from having
the time of your life

11:04.064 --> 11:06.734
to calling your fiancÃ©e a bitch,

11:06.767 --> 11:08.301
saying you couldn't
marry Katie...

11:08.335 --> 11:09.402
- Yeah.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.338
- Pooping in a dress on TV.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.306
[laughter]

11:13.340 --> 11:15.308
- Leave him the f--- alone!

11:15.342 --> 11:18.145
He's a f---ing battered wife!

11:18.178 --> 11:19.813
Look at him!

11:21.281 --> 11:24.351
- Your best friend called you
"a battered wife."

11:24.384 --> 11:27.187
Did this ruin
your bachelor party?

11:27.220 --> 11:28.889
- You would think it would have.

11:28.922 --> 11:30.090
[laughter]

11:30.123 --> 11:31.458
- You kept calling Katie
a bitch.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.193
You were like,
"I'm not marrying you."

11:33.226 --> 11:34.261
- No.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.328
- Did you think
that Katie, like,

11:35.362 --> 11:36.797
asked Kristen to do that?

11:36.830 --> 11:38.365
Is that why you were so mad?

11:38.398 --> 11:40.200
You were misdirected.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.369
- I was infuriated
at the timing of it.

11:42.402 --> 11:45.105
Like, I mean,
she Dr. Phil'd me.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.406
- Whenever Katie says,

11:46.439 --> 11:48.108
"He doesn't acknowledge
my feelings,"

11:48.141 --> 11:50.811
she's f---ing mad at him,
because he never acknowledged

11:50.844 --> 11:52.445
that she was hurt
about the Vegas thing.

11:52.479 --> 11:53.480
- Oh, I totally
acknowledged it.

11:53.513 --> 11:54.447
- No matter what--

11:54.481 --> 11:56.149
- I don't think you understand
the gravity

11:56.183 --> 11:57.217
of, like, the devastation
I felt.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.185
And I think--because--

11:58.218 --> 11:59.753
- I don't think you understand
the gravity

11:59.787 --> 12:00.821
and the devastation I feel

12:00.854 --> 12:02.289
on a monthly basis
for five years,

12:02.322 --> 12:04.191
dealing with your blow-ups.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.827
- It was an isolated incident

12:06.860 --> 12:08.195
which was very unfortunate

12:08.228 --> 12:09.229
and I feel horrible about.

12:09.262 --> 12:10.831
And I did--Bubba, come on.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.866
Did I or did I not express
how bad I felt--

12:12.900 --> 12:15.335
- No, you did,
but, Tom--

12:15.368 --> 12:16.536
- Why was it unresolved
for you?

12:16.569 --> 12:20.140
- Because Tom, yes, you did
express that you felt bad--

12:20.173 --> 12:22.175
- I felt horrible.
I felt sick inside.

12:22.209 --> 12:23.276
- Tom, I forgive you
for that,

12:23.310 --> 12:24.444
and I tried to move on.

12:24.477 --> 12:26.780
It was up to me to put back
those pieces

12:26.814 --> 12:28.215
along with you as well

12:28.248 --> 12:31.551
as try to make myself
feel whole about that again.

12:31.584 --> 12:35.122
- Katie, had you been
cheated on in the past?

12:35.155 --> 12:36.556
Do you have trust issues
with guys?

12:36.589 --> 12:38.258
- Yes.

12:38.291 --> 12:40.928
- I inherited
a lot of her insecurities,

12:40.961 --> 12:42.863
you know, about guys in LA.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.564
And she was a little jaded
and cynical,

12:44.597 --> 12:46.466
and I inherited a lot of that.

12:46.499 --> 12:49.269
- He had some kind of resolution
of saying,

12:49.302 --> 12:52.205
"You know, I f---ed up,
and I made out with this girl."

12:52.239 --> 12:53.974
That was enough, surely,

12:54.007 --> 12:55.542
I mean, apart from
a deeper apology.

12:55.575 --> 12:57.978
But suddenly they started saying

12:58.011 --> 12:59.246
that he slept with this girl.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.881
How would they know?
They weren't there.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.215
- Yeah, Kristen,
that was messed up.

13:02.249 --> 13:03.283
You were literally lying.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.986
- To start saying,
"You slept with"--you know, why?

13:06.019 --> 13:09.222
[people talking at once]

13:09.256 --> 13:10.423
- Hold on.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.591
Jax, you said it happened.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.293
- Don't tell me
that I'm f---ing lying.

13:13.326 --> 13:15.228
- Okay, guys, guys.
[people talking at once]

13:15.262 --> 13:16.396
Guys, hold on.
Hold on.

13:16.429 --> 13:17.430
- You were opening
a can of worms

13:17.464 --> 13:18.465
that didn't need to be opened.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.968
- Hold on.
Jax, you said

13:21.001 --> 13:23.503
it seemed to you
that Schwartz had sex...

13:23.536 --> 13:25.372
- Well, then it must be true.
- With the Vegas girl.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.207
- Yeah, who knows what I said?
Yeah, well--

13:27.240 --> 13:29.309
- So I want to know from you,

13:29.342 --> 13:30.310
what happened?

13:30.343 --> 13:31.578
- Yeah, well, the truth is--

13:31.611 --> 13:32.880
the truth is,
it's convenient for me

13:32.913 --> 13:34.247
that I don't remember,

13:34.281 --> 13:36.516
'cause I was really, really
f---ed up.

13:36.549 --> 13:39.252
But, I mean, I can say
with almost 100% confidence

13:39.286 --> 13:40.387
we didn't have sex.

13:40.420 --> 13:43.023
I was so disgustingly
inebriated.

13:43.056 --> 13:45.358
- When I initially
brought it up to him,

13:45.392 --> 13:47.460
he denied that anything happened
in Vegas.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.462
And then it was, like,
a month later

13:49.496 --> 13:50.597
that he was, like,
"Actually, it did,

13:50.630 --> 13:51.899
but we just made out."

13:51.932 --> 13:53.901
- You do believe
that he had sex, right?

13:53.934 --> 13:56.436
- I mean, now, like,
since talking to him

13:56.469 --> 13:57.604
and just, like,
really being like,

13:57.637 --> 14:00.307
"Oh, well, the act,
I can get over."

14:00.340 --> 14:02.609
Like, it's just
a physical thing

14:02.642 --> 14:04.477
that I can move past it.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.313
And you had betrayed
my trust,

14:06.346 --> 14:07.915
and it took a long time
for me to repair it.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.017
I know you apologized
and you felt remorse.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.351
I carried that with me.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.353
I carried that
in my self-confidence

14:13.386 --> 14:15.422
and all of my doubts
and my insecurities.

14:15.455 --> 14:16.924
That still stuck with me.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.425
I pushed it way down low,

14:18.458 --> 14:19.993
but that doesn't mean
it wasn't there.

14:22.295 --> 14:23.897
- Lisa, how did you feel

14:23.931 --> 14:26.266
when you watched Katie spend
her bachelorette party

14:26.299 --> 14:27.901
accusing someone of cheating

14:27.935 --> 14:29.903
and Schwartz calling Katie
a bitch?

14:29.937 --> 14:32.039
- Well, I had no idea
how bad it was.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.473
I'd heard rumblings,

14:33.506 --> 14:36.009
and I'd heard the sadness
in Katie's voice

14:36.043 --> 14:37.510
when I'd spoken to her
on the phone,

14:37.544 --> 14:40.580
so I knew things weren't going
that well, so to speak.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.249
That's the understatement
of the year,

14:42.282 --> 14:45.285
'cause when I saw it,
it was just so disappointing.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.620
And now I realize I was right
in actually saying,

14:47.654 --> 14:50.323
"I just can't be part of this."

14:50.357 --> 14:52.525
- Was Lisa your first choice
to officiate the wedding?

14:52.559 --> 14:53.526
- She was our first
and only choice.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.627
- Always, yeah.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.329
- We were so excited.
- Oh, man.

14:56.363 --> 14:59.399
We were overjoyed.
We were giddy, like kids.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.534
- Yeah, and he, like,
wrote this whole limerick.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.003
- Oh, yeah.

15:03.036 --> 15:04.304
- And we had thought up
this really great plan

15:04.337 --> 15:05.538
to surprise, and--

15:05.572 --> 15:08.608
- It was a very difficult
situation, you know,

15:08.641 --> 15:12.512
because I do really love
these two so much,

15:12.545 --> 15:15.315
and I see so many mistakes
they've made,

15:15.348 --> 15:17.717
and I wanted it to be
so right for them,

15:17.750 --> 15:20.687
but I felt I couldn't
give it my blessing

15:20.720 --> 15:23.456
when it had just potential
for disaster.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.492
- You were a nightmare
of a human being

15:25.525 --> 15:26.726
for the first
two to three years I dated you.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.628
- You put a ring
on my f---ing finger,

15:28.661 --> 15:29.629
so stop throwing it
in my f---ing face.

15:29.662 --> 15:31.464
- You don't remember,
'cause you were too drunk.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.033
- No, I wasn't, Tom!
- Okay, Katie.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.034
- What'd she do to you?

15:34.067 --> 15:35.302
- She sat me down to say,

15:35.335 --> 15:36.436
"I know you f---ed
that girl in Vegas."

15:36.469 --> 15:37.737
- Yeah, well, you did,
so...

15:37.770 --> 15:40.440
- Yeah,
and you're also a bitch.

15:40.473 --> 15:43.610
- I just also felt they'd lost
respect for each other totally.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.112
- Clearly.
- Yeah.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.746
- I wanted them to understand

15:46.779 --> 15:49.716
the seriousness
of the commitment.

15:49.749 --> 15:52.452
- Her sitting us down,
that was--

15:52.485 --> 15:54.121
that hit real hard
and real deep,

15:54.154 --> 15:56.389
because--looking at
how much damage we had done,

15:56.423 --> 15:58.058
it was the most
depressing thing.

15:58.091 --> 15:59.426
- I cried with her.

15:59.459 --> 16:02.429
- Yeah, I mean,
we fell in love and, like--

16:02.462 --> 16:03.630
- We lost our innocence
too soon,

16:03.663 --> 16:05.165
and just we started arguing
over stupid sh--.

16:05.198 --> 16:06.633
- But we still knew
all along

16:06.666 --> 16:08.668
that we really wanted
to be together.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.537
We really wanted that,

16:10.570 --> 16:11.671
but we didn't know how
to get it back.

16:11.704 --> 16:14.541
- I have to say it was amazing
seeing the turnaround

16:14.574 --> 16:15.608
between the two of you,

16:15.642 --> 16:18.045
because you really were
at each other's throats.

16:18.078 --> 16:20.613
And as a viewer,
I was watching thinking,

16:20.647 --> 16:22.549
"They're never gonna be able
to get this back."

16:22.582 --> 16:25.552
But you really did see
a difference

16:25.585 --> 16:28.488
in how the two of you
were looking at each other,

16:28.521 --> 16:30.023
treating each other.

16:30.057 --> 16:32.092
- I love and care about Katie,

16:32.125 --> 16:34.627
and I know that the two of them
are meant to be together,

16:34.661 --> 16:35.762
and I've always felt that way.

16:35.795 --> 16:39.466
And I just knew that they were
gonna work through it.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.434
And I knew it was gonna happen.

16:41.468 --> 16:43.070
- We're also the last remaining
original couple

16:43.103 --> 16:44.071
in the whole group.

16:44.104 --> 16:45.638
- I know.
That's so true.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.440
That's so crazy.

16:47.474 --> 16:50.777
- Who do we feel like the next
couple to be engaged is?

16:50.810 --> 16:55.048
Do we feel like maybe it's gonna
be Kristen and Carter?

16:55.082 --> 16:58.651
Could it be Brittany and Jax?

16:58.685 --> 17:00.753
These guys?
What do we think?

17:00.787 --> 17:03.156
I feel like Kristen may
sneak in with an engagement.

17:03.190 --> 17:04.524
- I don't know.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.126
I might able to, like,
trick him into it.

17:06.159 --> 17:07.760
- You might trick him into it?
Is that what you said?

17:07.794 --> 17:09.562
[laughter]

17:10.530 --> 17:11.564
- Shut up!

17:11.598 --> 17:12.732
- Oh, there it is.
Seeing red.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.534
He had a vodka soda at lunch.
- Just shut your mouth.

17:14.567 --> 17:17.570
- James, did you have
a vodka soda at lunch?

17:21.274 --> 17:23.276
[light music]

17:23.310 --> 17:25.478
- We are back with the
"Vanderpump Rules" reunion.

17:25.512 --> 17:29.249
Finally, we get
to wedding weekend

17:29.282 --> 17:31.184
at Twenty Mile House.

17:31.218 --> 17:34.154
$51,000 later...

17:34.187 --> 17:35.422
[laughter]

17:35.455 --> 17:37.157
- The bargain price.

17:37.190 --> 17:40.127
- Katie, you must have known
the overall price of the wedding

17:40.160 --> 17:41.261
was creeping up.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.830
You didn't think that was
worth mentioning to Schwartz?

17:43.863 --> 17:45.332
- You said, "You just
plan everything

17:45.365 --> 17:46.466
and give me the bill
at the end."

17:46.499 --> 17:48.135
You did say that,

17:48.168 --> 17:49.269
'cause you didn't want
to be sweating everything.

17:49.302 --> 17:52.839
- Lisa, what did you think
of the rehearsal dinner theme

17:52.872 --> 17:54.841
of Taco Tuesday on a Blanket?

17:54.874 --> 17:57.677
- I mean, not the way I roll,
but you know what?

17:57.710 --> 18:00.313
Everything they did
was different.

18:00.347 --> 18:02.582
There was nothing about it
that was conventional.

18:02.615 --> 18:03.583
That's who they are, and--

18:03.616 --> 18:06.186
- I have to say--
sorry to--

18:06.219 --> 18:07.854
- Don't grab my leg.

18:07.887 --> 18:09.189
- [laughs]

18:09.222 --> 18:11.491
- Schwartz, as a groom,

18:11.524 --> 18:13.593
I feel like you would want
to be squeaky clean

18:13.626 --> 18:14.661
on your wedding day,

18:14.694 --> 18:19.466
and seeing you take that
whore's bath in the river...

18:19.499 --> 18:21.634
[light upbeat music]

18:21.668 --> 18:23.703
- Ah!
[growls]

18:23.736 --> 18:26.306
- Is that your definition
of woodsy elegant?

18:26.339 --> 18:27.507
I mean...
[laughter]

18:27.540 --> 18:30.177
I'm surprised you didn't just
put a little water right here

18:30.210 --> 18:31.344
and go get married.

18:31.378 --> 18:32.479
- I felt like I was sort of...

18:32.512 --> 18:33.646
- Baptizing?
- Baptizing.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.715
Thank you, yeah.
- It worked out.

18:35.748 --> 18:39.486
- I got very choked up
when the triplets walked in...

18:39.519 --> 18:40.587
- Oh, yeah.
- Aw!

18:40.620 --> 18:41.921
- At the rehearsal dinner.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.623
- We wanted to give you
your wedding present

18:43.656 --> 18:45.192
a little early.

18:45.225 --> 18:46.593
- It's not steaks
between your butt cheeks?

18:46.626 --> 18:48.261
What the f---?

18:48.295 --> 18:51.598
- What's up?
- Oh, man, you--

18:51.631 --> 18:54.267
- Tom.
- Oh, this guy too.

18:54.301 --> 18:55.468
- You made it.

18:55.502 --> 18:57.670
- You can't have a wedding
without your brothers here, man.

18:57.704 --> 18:59.606
Come on, now.

18:59.639 --> 19:02.709
- [sniffles]
My God, man.

19:02.742 --> 19:05.312
I would say that was, bar none,

19:05.345 --> 19:07.547
one of the sweetest,
nicest things

19:07.580 --> 19:09.682
that anyone's ever done
for me in my life.

19:09.716 --> 19:10.917
And as long as I'm
on this planet,

19:10.950 --> 19:12.319
I will never forget that.

19:12.352 --> 19:14.254
- Tom, that was a good one.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.256
- Andy, I had no idea.

19:16.289 --> 19:18.358
They still talk about it
every time I talk to them.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.260
You don't know how much
that meant to my brothers.

19:20.293 --> 19:21.494
- I bet.
- I know it did.

19:21.528 --> 19:23.396
I totally could tell.
I loved it.

19:23.430 --> 19:24.964
- Katie, we saw you
getting worked up

19:24.997 --> 19:27.300
about a lot of details
about the wedding.

19:27.334 --> 19:30.770
However, when your wedding dress
didn't fit right,

19:30.803 --> 19:32.539
most brides would have
flipped out.

19:32.572 --> 19:34.674
You totally kept your cool.

19:34.707 --> 19:37.344
- The only time
I questioned the Taco Tuesday

19:37.377 --> 19:38.745
was putting
that wedding dress on.

19:38.778 --> 19:39.779
[laughter]

19:39.812 --> 19:41.514
- She was the calmest bride.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.550
- Were you on Xanax edibles?

19:43.583 --> 19:44.951
- The day of
the rehearsal dinner,

19:44.984 --> 19:46.353
I ate, like, some weed candy.

19:46.386 --> 19:47.487
But the day of my wedding,

19:47.520 --> 19:49.722
I just wanted to just be
super present

19:49.756 --> 19:51.258
and coherent the whole time

19:51.291 --> 19:52.425
and just be able
to take it all in.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.527
- And you were diligent
about getting everything done

19:54.561 --> 19:55.695
leading up to the wedding.

19:55.728 --> 19:57.630
Or we were.
We were diligent.

19:57.664 --> 20:00.267
- Katie, happy to be
Mrs. Bubba Schwartz?

20:00.300 --> 20:02.001
- Mrs. Bubba Maloney Schwartz.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.470
- Mrs. Bubba Maloney Schwartz.

20:03.503 --> 20:05.405
- Yeah, that day,
I was just standing there,

20:05.438 --> 20:06.706
and seeing everyone
just enjoying themselves,

20:06.739 --> 20:09.242
I just was like--
I pinched myself.

20:09.276 --> 20:11.311
I'm like, "I can't believe
that this is our wedding."

20:11.344 --> 20:12.712
- Kristen, what was
the most emotional part

20:12.745 --> 20:13.746
of the wedding for you?

20:13.780 --> 20:15.515
- Tom's vows.
- Oh, stop.

20:15.548 --> 20:16.516
- Totally.
- Hands down.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.017
- You make me cry.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.019
We almost became, like,
another relationship statistic,

20:20.052 --> 20:22.322
another failed romance
in La La Land.

20:22.355 --> 20:24.257
But we persevered.

20:24.291 --> 20:25.625
As I stand here today
in this moment

20:25.658 --> 20:27.994
before my dream girl,
my beautiful bride-to-be,

20:28.027 --> 20:30.563
before my friends and family,
who I love,

20:30.597 --> 20:32.999
I can honestly say
from the bottom of my heart

20:33.032 --> 20:36.269
that I've never loved you more
than this moment right here.

20:36.303 --> 20:38.338
- It was incredible.
- It was amazing.

20:38.371 --> 20:39.572
- Oh, thanks, Andy.

20:39.606 --> 20:41.608
- We never get to see him
be romantic, though.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.743
Normally, they just do
this whole, like,

20:43.776 --> 20:45.378
"Bubba, Bubbie."

20:45.412 --> 20:47.447
And then I'm watching him
pour his heart out.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.581
I'm like, "Holy sh--."

20:48.615 --> 20:50.617
- When did you write the vows?
Right before the wedding?

20:50.650 --> 20:52.018
- About two minutes
before the wedding.

20:52.051 --> 20:53.453
- Was it, like, 15 minutes,
while I took a walk?

20:53.486 --> 20:54.621
- We were getting ready
to put our suits on.

20:54.654 --> 20:55.788
He's like, "Yo,
give me five minutes.

20:55.822 --> 20:57.357
I got to go write my vows."

20:57.390 --> 20:59.759
- Sandoval, you were crying
into the dog.

20:59.792 --> 21:02.028
You were using the dog
as a handkerchief.

21:02.061 --> 21:03.663
- Yeah.

21:03.696 --> 21:05.332
[sniffs]

21:05.365 --> 21:06.533
[sniffing]

21:08.635 --> 21:10.703
- It was allergies, right?
- It was allergies.

21:10.737 --> 21:12.605
- Even Jax got emotional.

21:12.639 --> 21:13.806
- Yeah, I mean,
there's no words.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.375
It was amazing.

21:15.408 --> 21:16.609
Something about your
best friend getting married

21:16.643 --> 21:17.644
and getting emotional.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.646
It's like, how do you not
get emotional with that?

21:19.679 --> 21:20.647
How do you not?

21:20.680 --> 21:22.349
I mean, you see girls cry.

21:22.382 --> 21:23.716
You see girls cry all the time,
especially this group.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.652
- You see Sandoval cry
all the time.

21:25.685 --> 21:29.389
Sandoval, you basically proposed
to Ariana at the wedding.

21:29.422 --> 21:30.657
- That's so tacky.

21:30.690 --> 21:32.525
- Why? Because it's stealing
the thunder?

21:32.559 --> 21:34.761
- Yeah.
I didn't think he was tacky.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.563
- Well, there was a lot
of love in the air,

21:36.596 --> 21:39.532
and when I'm feeling loving,
I want to project that

21:39.566 --> 21:41.534
onto, you know,
the woman I love.

21:41.568 --> 21:42.802
- You know what I like
about you?

21:42.835 --> 21:44.637
You have so many feelings.

21:44.671 --> 21:45.872
- I do have
a lot of feelings.

21:45.905 --> 21:48.375
- He's got all the feelings.
- Well, thanks.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.777
- I feel bad,
because in that moment

21:50.810 --> 21:52.512
and in moments like that,

21:52.545 --> 21:57.417
I am oftentimes overwhelmed
by how much I love you,

21:57.450 --> 22:00.119
but when you say things
like that, I'm like, "Ah..."

22:00.152 --> 22:02.455
And I, like, retreat
into my shell.

22:02.489 --> 22:04.791
I feel bad, because I feel like
I didn't really give you

22:04.824 --> 22:08.395
the moment that you deserved
at that time.

22:08.428 --> 22:09.429
- You didn't have to.

22:09.462 --> 22:10.463
- Well, at some point,

22:10.497 --> 22:11.498
you're gonna need to take it in.

22:11.531 --> 22:12.699
- I know.
I'm not good at that.

22:12.732 --> 22:13.833
- What if you guys just do
a civil ceremony

22:13.866 --> 22:15.568
so it's not, like,
legally documented,

22:15.602 --> 22:16.736
but you can still have
a ceremony?

22:16.769 --> 22:18.805
- Yeah.
- So it's like you get the--

22:18.838 --> 22:20.840
- I would actually rather do
the legal document

22:20.873 --> 22:22.409
and then not have
a ceremony.

22:22.442 --> 22:23.443
- Oh. What?
- Is that weird?

22:23.476 --> 22:25.412
- Schwartz, is there anything
you would change

22:25.445 --> 22:26.479
about the wedding?

22:26.513 --> 22:28.715
- I can honestly say,
from the bottom of my heart,

22:28.748 --> 22:29.849
I wouldn't change--

22:29.882 --> 22:31.451
well, actually,
there was one moment

22:31.484 --> 22:32.685
where the DJ played, like,

22:32.719 --> 22:34.654
four really bad Top 40 songs
in a row.

22:34.687 --> 22:37.123
But aside from that,
I've said it so many times,

22:37.156 --> 22:39.726
it's starting to feel stale,
but it was truly a fairy tale,

22:39.759 --> 22:41.694
and it was the happiest day
of my life.

22:41.728 --> 22:43.463
And I'm so happy
that I get to share it

22:43.496 --> 22:44.597
with millions of people

22:44.631 --> 22:45.898
and I got to share it
with you guys.

22:45.932 --> 22:46.899
I wish
you would have been there.

22:46.933 --> 22:48.435
Even James, sh--,

22:48.468 --> 22:49.436
I wish you would have
been there too.

22:49.469 --> 22:50.470
- Thanks, buddy.

22:50.503 --> 22:51.738
Could have DJ'd,
not played Top 40.

22:51.771 --> 22:53.440
[laughter]

22:53.473 --> 22:54.907
- So, James, I want to talk
about your performance.

22:54.941 --> 22:56.476
- Oh, cool.
- Your DJ performance.

22:56.509 --> 22:57.777
- Yeah, let's do it.

22:57.810 --> 22:59.579
* Taking me to a higher place
on the daily *

22:59.612 --> 23:01.180
* Not gonna hit,
'cause you'll think I'm crazy *

23:01.213 --> 23:03.416
- Kristen, can you
look James in the eye

23:03.450 --> 23:04.617
and tell him
you had good intentions

23:04.651 --> 23:05.818
about going to that?

23:05.852 --> 23:07.554
- Oh, hell, no.

23:07.587 --> 23:09.822
- That night, your f---ing
decisions--disgusting.

23:09.856 --> 23:10.957
- I felt sorry for him,

23:10.990 --> 23:12.992
because he'd been let go
from Sur,

23:13.025 --> 23:16.162
and they were all salaciously
kind of enjoying that moment,

23:16.195 --> 23:17.797
and then he'd gone on
to find another job,

23:17.830 --> 23:19.699
and then they put that at risk,
because they knew--

23:19.732 --> 23:20.900
- Lisa, after what he's
put me through--

23:20.933 --> 23:22.869
- Oh, shut up.

23:22.902 --> 23:26.506
- Jax, that included James
being accused of cheating,

23:26.539 --> 23:27.774
you trying to fight James,

23:27.807 --> 23:30.677
and James getting thrown out
of his own show.

23:32.712 --> 23:35.915
[tense music]

23:35.948 --> 23:37.016
[glass shatters]

23:37.049 --> 23:38.485
- Jax!

23:38.518 --> 23:39.952
- You're all f---ing losers!

23:39.986 --> 23:43.590
- Was that a good night
or the best night ever for you?

23:43.623 --> 23:44.857
- I was pretty happy.

23:44.891 --> 23:46.192
Yeah, I thought it was like--

23:46.225 --> 23:47.627
I was like, "Okay,
mission accomplished."

23:47.660 --> 23:48.661
- Haters, man.

23:48.695 --> 23:50.830
You don't come up to the
one and only James Kennedy

23:50.863 --> 23:52.465
after a bloody performance--

23:52.499 --> 23:53.733
- We didn't even walk over
to you, thought.

23:53.766 --> 23:54.867
You walked over to us.

23:54.901 --> 23:56.936
- Kristen, you loved
the performance, bro.

23:56.969 --> 23:59.038
When we were together,
all you used to praise about

23:59.071 --> 24:01.808
is how f---ing talented I was,
and the second we break up,

24:01.841 --> 24:02.942
that's when you start
sh---ing on me.

24:02.975 --> 24:04.644
Shut your mouth;
you're irrelevant.

24:04.677 --> 24:05.778
- Okay...
- Shut up!

24:05.812 --> 24:07.914
Shut up!
- Oh, there it is. Seeing red.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.582
- [sighs]
- He had a vodka soda at lunch.

24:09.616 --> 24:10.817
- Just shut your mouth.
- Sh-- about to hit the fan.

24:10.850 --> 24:12.652
- Fine. You know what?
Over it.

24:12.685 --> 24:13.820
- James, did you have
a vodka soda at lunch?

24:13.853 --> 24:14.887
- I'm more talented

24:14.921 --> 24:16.489
than this entire bunch
put together.

24:16.523 --> 24:17.690
- Did you have
a vodka soda at lunch, James?

24:17.724 --> 24:18.758
- Yeah, I did.

24:18.791 --> 24:19.892
- Oh.
Did you have two?

24:19.926 --> 24:23.596
- No, I had one.
- Okay.

24:23.630 --> 24:26.999
So new topic.

24:27.033 --> 24:28.668
Scheana, in a few minutes,

24:28.701 --> 24:30.970
your ex-husband, Mike Shay,
is gonna be joining us.

24:31.003 --> 24:33.706
You haven't seen him
for four months.

24:33.740 --> 24:35.041
- Yup.

24:35.074 --> 24:36.543
Not looking forward to it.

24:36.576 --> 24:37.944
- Do you even have
his phone number?

24:37.977 --> 24:41.080
- No, 'cause he wouldn't
pay his own phone bill,

24:41.113 --> 24:43.015
so I ended up
having to cancel his line.

24:43.049 --> 24:45.952
- How are you feeling now
about the breakup?

24:45.985 --> 24:49.756
- I mean, it was definitely
for the best.

24:49.789 --> 24:52.625
I just--oh.

24:52.659 --> 24:55.094
[tearfully]
I don't want to see him.

24:57.063 --> 25:01.534
I just want to keep being
in my happy place in my life,

25:01.568 --> 25:02.669
and he's not a part of it.

25:02.702 --> 25:04.971
- I'm, like, scared for him
to be around all of us.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.639
- I don't want him
to be here.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.875
I'm too sober for this.

25:08.908 --> 25:12.011
- Well, let's get ourselves
together.

25:12.044 --> 25:13.012
We'll take a break.

25:13.045 --> 25:14.714
And when we come back,

25:14.747 --> 25:16.282
Mike Shay will join us.

25:16.315 --> 25:18.585
[dramatic music]

25:18.618 --> 25:19.919
- [exhales]

25:20.887 --> 25:22.622
Why do you keep withdrawing
so much cash?

25:22.655 --> 25:23.890
- For my business.

25:23.923 --> 25:25.925
- You had just pulled $600 cash
out of the ATM

25:25.958 --> 25:27.059
in exchange for 50 pills.

25:27.093 --> 25:28.327
- You're crazy.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.129
- Because that's where
my switch flipped.

25:33.666 --> 25:37.169
[low, dramatic music]

25:37.203 --> 25:42.642
*

25:42.675 --> 25:44.176
- You've got this, girl.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.244
We all have your f---ing back.

25:45.277 --> 25:46.913
- Thank you.

25:46.946 --> 25:48.247
- I don't know what I'm thinking
right now, honestly.

25:48.280 --> 25:49.248
- I would like to say

25:49.281 --> 25:51.718
I don't think he's going
to come in guns blazing,

25:51.751 --> 25:52.952
but I don't know him anymore.

25:52.985 --> 25:53.953
- I don't either.

25:53.986 --> 25:55.622
- Watch your step down here.

25:55.655 --> 25:57.957
- Just remember light
at the end of the tunnel.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.926
Your life is so good
right now.

25:59.959 --> 26:01.227
- You're so f---ing happy.

26:01.260 --> 26:02.261
You're with all your friends.

26:02.294 --> 26:03.930
Just breathe.

26:03.963 --> 26:05.364
*

26:05.397 --> 26:09.068
- Quiet, please.

26:09.101 --> 26:10.202
Here we go.

26:10.236 --> 26:14.206
- Five, four, three, two...

26:14.240 --> 26:17.143
- We are back at
the "Vanderpump Rules" reunion,

26:17.176 --> 26:19.646
and Mike Shay has joined us.

26:19.679 --> 26:21.113
Hi, Mike.
- How's it going?

26:21.147 --> 26:22.982
- It's going good.
How's it going with you?

26:23.015 --> 26:25.117
- Uh, I'm okay.
- Yeah?

26:25.151 --> 26:27.086
- A little nervous
right now, but...

26:27.119 --> 26:29.355
Got a lot of emotions
going on.

26:29.388 --> 26:31.023
- Where are you living
these days?

26:31.057 --> 26:32.659
- At my parents'.

26:32.692 --> 26:34.226
- So here you are.
I mean, it's kind of odd.

26:34.260 --> 26:37.664
We saw you guys get married
in this storybook wedding.

26:37.697 --> 26:40.066
- I, Scheana...
- Choose you, Michael...

26:40.099 --> 26:41.367
- Choose you, Michael...

26:41.400 --> 26:43.369
- To be my husband.
- To be my husband.

26:43.402 --> 26:46.305
- Through the good times...
- And through the hard times.

26:46.338 --> 26:48.140
- I now declare you
to be husband and wife.

26:48.174 --> 26:49.275
- [squeals]

26:49.308 --> 26:50.309
- You may kiss your bride.

26:50.342 --> 26:51.744
[cheers and applause]

26:51.778 --> 26:53.179
- Here we are.

26:53.212 --> 26:55.715
You two haven't seen each other
for four months.

26:55.748 --> 26:57.283
Are you officially
divorced?

26:57.316 --> 26:59.151
- I haven't gotten anything
in the mail.

27:00.252 --> 27:01.821
They said it takes six
to eight months in California.

27:01.854 --> 27:03.756
- Oh, okay.
- It's only been, like, three.

27:03.790 --> 27:05.057
- Got it.

27:05.091 --> 27:06.993
Scheana, all season long,
you kept saying,

27:07.026 --> 27:09.395
"Shay's at the studio,
Shay's at the studio"

27:09.428 --> 27:10.830
until it finally came out

27:10.863 --> 27:14.734
that he was actually sleeping
at the studio

27:14.767 --> 27:17.103
and not coming home
for days at a time.

27:17.136 --> 27:20.239
Were you consciously hiding
your marital issues,

27:20.272 --> 27:23.309
or did you truly not know
that something was going on?

27:23.342 --> 27:27.179
- I don't think I knew the--
to the extent or the extreme

27:27.213 --> 27:30.149
that it would go to,
but, yeah, I knew.

27:30.182 --> 27:31.183
It was Katie's summer.

27:31.217 --> 27:33.285
It wasn't gonna
bring up my sh--.

27:33.319 --> 27:36.355
- What are you talking about,
"days at a time"?

27:36.388 --> 27:38.190
The only time
I never came home--

27:38.224 --> 27:40.192
- At the end,
you didn't come home for two--

27:40.226 --> 27:41.728
you never came home again.

27:41.761 --> 27:42.829
You literally
never came home again,

27:42.862 --> 27:44.030
so that is days at a time.

27:44.063 --> 27:45.164
- I couldn't.

27:45.197 --> 27:47.133
- You also couldn't
communicate with me.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.435
- You went from texting me
"Are you okay," everything.

27:49.468 --> 27:51.103
And I said, "I'm fine."

27:51.137 --> 27:54.473
Then the next day, "Oh,
you must be out of control.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.108
You're on a binge."

27:56.142 --> 27:58.277
Like, it was so calculated
and crazy, it was--

27:58.310 --> 28:01.180
- So there wasn't
a certain friend of ours

28:01.213 --> 28:04.083
who you were meeting up with
to buy things from?

28:05.351 --> 28:07.119
And you lied to me,
and then I found out

28:07.153 --> 28:10.056
you gave him $600 cash
in exchange for 50 pills.

28:10.089 --> 28:11.190
- You're crazy.

28:11.223 --> 28:13.492
- Because that's where
my switch flipped.

28:13.525 --> 28:16.395
Are you gonna say
that's not true?

28:16.428 --> 28:18.197
You're not denying it.

28:18.230 --> 28:20.199
- Yeah, I did not--
you're--dude.

28:20.232 --> 28:23.870
- Shay, she said you had
taken out a big chunk of money

28:23.903 --> 28:25.471
from your joint bank account.

28:25.504 --> 28:28.407
- It would be 1,000 here,
600 here, another 600 here.

28:28.440 --> 28:29.776
And I'm like...
- Yeah, putting into...

28:29.809 --> 28:31.077
- "Why are you withdrawing
so much cash?"

28:31.110 --> 28:32.211
- What I just built--

28:32.244 --> 28:33.345
For my business.

28:33.379 --> 28:34.513
- Whose money was it?

28:34.546 --> 28:36.115
- It was always her money.

28:36.148 --> 28:37.283
She always held that
over my head.

28:37.316 --> 28:39.218
It was never our--
when we got married,

28:39.251 --> 28:40.452
it was never our marriage.

28:40.486 --> 28:42.188
It was always about you.

28:42.221 --> 28:45.191
- Shay, the first we heard
something was seriously wrong

28:45.224 --> 28:46.759
was when Scheana told Lisa

28:46.793 --> 28:49.228
that you hadn't come home
for a week.

28:49.261 --> 28:51.297
What happened that first night

28:51.330 --> 28:54.433
that made you decide
not to come home?

28:56.135 --> 28:57.369
- It was done for a while,

28:57.403 --> 28:59.438
and just something clicked,
and it was like...

28:59.471 --> 29:02.474
- I was there with her,
and she was just devastated.

29:02.508 --> 29:04.176
It was heartbreaking.

29:04.210 --> 29:06.145
It's heartbreaking for me
to even watch it.

29:06.178 --> 29:08.848
It's so--
it's just not the way

29:08.881 --> 29:10.216
it even should have
went about.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.518
- Why didn't you communicate
to her

29:12.551 --> 29:14.120
how you were feeling?

29:14.153 --> 29:15.121
- She doesn't listen.

29:15.154 --> 29:16.255
She--all I wanted--

29:16.288 --> 29:17.790
- You were never there
for me to listen to.

29:17.824 --> 29:19.792
- That is a complaint
that he's had for--

29:19.826 --> 29:21.493
- You're never there
emotionally--

29:21.527 --> 29:24.864
- He's said that
on the show a few times.

29:24.897 --> 29:26.498
- [sighs]
Dude.

29:26.532 --> 29:28.868
- Oh, my God, the way
she spoke about you to me...

29:28.901 --> 29:30.236
- Okay, Lisa.

29:30.269 --> 29:31.804
- You were the greatest person
on the planet.

29:31.838 --> 29:33.906
I never could quite
understand it.

29:35.842 --> 29:36.843
She worshipped him.

29:36.876 --> 29:38.244
I know that.
We saw that.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.947
Her whole world
revolved around you.

29:40.980 --> 29:43.282
- And my whole world
revolved around her.

29:43.315 --> 29:45.251
- Yes, I was there.
I was there, supporting you.

29:45.284 --> 29:46.485
- And you used that
against me.

29:46.518 --> 29:47.887
Your world revolved
around me.

29:47.920 --> 29:49.355
- I gave you everything.

29:49.388 --> 29:50.422
- Well, she gave you
everything.

29:50.456 --> 29:52.324
- So did I.
Are you kidding me?

29:52.358 --> 29:54.226
- I saw a change in her,
I felt like,

29:54.260 --> 29:55.461
in the beginning of the summer,

29:55.494 --> 29:59.498
because you guys started, like,
sending, like, cute selfies.

29:59.531 --> 30:01.167
And, like, she was trying
really hard.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.969
And I feel like you had
already given up,

30:03.002 --> 30:04.904
because then you started
going in the studio,

30:04.937 --> 30:06.272
and she supported that.

30:06.305 --> 30:08.174
She was, like, helping you
at the studio.

30:08.207 --> 30:10.542
- And she was covering
for you all the time.

30:10.576 --> 30:12.011
- Covering for what?

30:12.044 --> 30:14.346
I literally built a business.
I have a business.

30:14.380 --> 30:15.915
- But she was
supporting it, Shay.

30:15.948 --> 30:17.950
- Yeah, but to you,
in front of you guys, she was,

30:17.984 --> 30:21.020
but she's one way to you guys,
and she was one way to me.

30:21.053 --> 30:23.589
- By the way,
what is your business, Shay?

30:23.622 --> 30:25.591
- I have a group.

30:25.624 --> 30:27.459
It's my music group.

30:27.493 --> 30:29.261
That's an official business now.

30:29.295 --> 30:30.429
We run out of the studio.

30:30.462 --> 30:32.464
We have seven artists
under us.

30:32.498 --> 30:34.600
And we're going on tour
with Bone Thugs-N-Harmony

30:34.633 --> 30:36.268
next month.

30:36.302 --> 30:38.604
- Jax, are you surprised
it's come to this?

30:38.637 --> 30:40.306
- No.

30:40.339 --> 30:42.341
- Why are you being so negative
about Scheana and Shay?

30:42.374 --> 30:43.575
You should be supportive.

30:43.609 --> 30:44.643
- I have milk that has
a longer shelf life

30:44.676 --> 30:46.045
than that marriage.

30:46.078 --> 30:48.580
I think they're both
great, great people.

30:48.614 --> 30:50.316
You know, I love them both.
I really do.

30:50.349 --> 30:51.517
I think the world of them.

30:51.550 --> 30:53.352
I don't know what goes
behind closed doors.

30:53.385 --> 30:54.620
None of us do.

30:54.653 --> 30:57.890
I just think they're meant
for different things.

30:57.924 --> 30:59.591
I think maybe
this is just something

30:59.625 --> 31:02.528
that God put in the way
to see if you can overcome--

31:02.561 --> 31:03.963
- All right.

31:03.996 --> 31:06.498
- They're both good people.
It just didn't work.

31:06.532 --> 31:07.633
You tried.
You definitely tried.

31:07.666 --> 31:08.634
- We gave it
one hell of a shot.

31:08.667 --> 31:10.002
That's for sure.
- You tried.

31:10.036 --> 31:13.572
- I just--man, I don't know.

31:15.674 --> 31:18.277
- Seeing you here right now
start to say things

31:18.310 --> 31:20.346
and then not finish
what you're saying, I just--

31:20.379 --> 31:21.347
- It's just--
yeah, I'm trying to--

31:21.380 --> 31:24.316
- And I know it's hard,
but I just still, like,

31:24.350 --> 31:26.385
have never really heard
from you.

31:26.418 --> 31:27.653
I never hear from you.

31:27.686 --> 31:28.955
- What do you want to hear
from him?

31:28.988 --> 31:29.989
- What was wrong?

31:30.022 --> 31:31.390
Because I know from her,

31:31.423 --> 31:33.525
but I don't really hear that
from you.

31:33.559 --> 31:36.028
You just ghost.

31:45.037 --> 31:46.505
- You hurt me that bad

31:46.538 --> 31:48.440
that I wanted to do what I could
to hurt you back.

31:48.474 --> 31:50.409
- You divorced me on camera.
- That's what I do.

31:50.442 --> 31:52.344
You hurt me,
I f--- you over.

31:56.148 --> 31:58.650
[upbeat music]

31:58.684 --> 32:00.186
- What do you want to hear
from him?

32:00.219 --> 32:01.420
- What was wrong?

32:01.453 --> 32:02.654
Because I know from her,

32:02.688 --> 32:05.057
but I don't really hear that
from you.

32:05.091 --> 32:06.425
You just ghost.

32:09.996 --> 32:11.130
I know it's hard to articulate,

32:11.163 --> 32:13.465
but I will literally sit here
in silence for ten minutes

32:13.499 --> 32:14.967
if that's what it takes.

32:15.001 --> 32:17.236
- Honestly,
we definitely grew apart.

32:17.269 --> 32:22.041
The lifestyle was--
I couldn't do it anymore.

32:22.074 --> 32:24.010
I quit drinking
for, like, a year.

32:24.043 --> 32:26.378
And then--but you expected me
to still go out

32:26.412 --> 32:27.746
and go to everything.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.115
- Because you always said
you were okay with it

32:29.148 --> 32:30.382
and it didn't bother you.

32:30.416 --> 32:32.251
- But when I didn't--
no, not towards the end.

32:32.284 --> 32:34.053
Towards the end,
I did not want to go.

32:34.086 --> 32:36.055
And then you just started
choosing going out

32:36.088 --> 32:38.157
instead of--I would be
at home, chilling.

32:38.190 --> 32:40.192
- You're acting like I was
going out five nights a week.

32:40.226 --> 32:41.293
- You don't listen to anything.

32:41.327 --> 32:43.996
- Scheana,
when did the relationship

32:44.030 --> 32:45.264
start to go south?

32:45.297 --> 32:48.000
- Three months
into getting married?

32:49.301 --> 32:52.104
That's when I found out
about the pills.

32:52.138 --> 32:54.073
The trust was broken right away.

32:54.106 --> 32:56.008
- You looked surprised
when she said

32:56.042 --> 32:58.277
three months
into the marriage.

32:58.310 --> 33:02.048
- For me, probably, like,
a year ago.

33:02.081 --> 33:04.250
- Well, after I saw those texts,

33:04.283 --> 33:07.519
it was really hard for me
to...

33:07.553 --> 33:09.155
You know?

33:09.188 --> 33:10.422
- What, the texts

33:10.456 --> 33:13.292
that a friend of mine
had sent me?

33:13.325 --> 33:15.461
- The "you on top of me" text?

33:17.563 --> 33:19.731
I--I caught him
texting another girl.

33:19.765 --> 33:21.267
Like, that's devastating.

33:22.501 --> 33:24.503
- Did you--were you
meeting up with that girl?

33:24.536 --> 33:26.205
Or was it purely a--
- No.

33:26.238 --> 33:27.306
- They talked about it,

33:27.339 --> 33:29.041
but she lived
across the country,

33:29.075 --> 33:30.442
so it would have been hard
to get away with.

33:30.476 --> 33:32.111
- I'm just curious.

33:32.144 --> 33:36.182
Why did you start reaching out
to this other girl?

33:36.215 --> 33:38.350
For emotional or whatever--

33:38.384 --> 33:39.785
- Yeah, I mean,
we were--

33:39.818 --> 33:41.287
I met this person.

33:41.320 --> 33:43.455
She came to Mixology,
and I worked there.

33:43.489 --> 33:44.790
She was there
with her friend.

33:44.823 --> 33:47.426
Maybe it--the texts
were inappropriate

33:47.459 --> 33:50.329
or a little more further
than just a friendship,

33:50.362 --> 33:52.831
but, I mean, it definitely was
a connection

33:52.864 --> 33:54.100
that I didn't have with her.

33:54.133 --> 33:56.068
- But you just got married.

33:56.102 --> 33:57.436
- That was right before
our first anniversary.

33:57.469 --> 33:58.770
- He's just being honest.

33:58.804 --> 34:00.406
He was trying to justify it,
but--

34:00.439 --> 34:01.473
- And I don't disagree
with that.

34:01.507 --> 34:03.142
- Yeah.

34:03.175 --> 34:04.310
- Scheana, you're obsessively

34:04.343 --> 34:05.577
doing your hair and makeup
over there.

34:05.611 --> 34:07.146
- Yeah, let it go, Scheana.

34:07.179 --> 34:09.215
- What's going on?
-I'm very uncomfortable.

34:09.248 --> 34:11.817
- So am I.
I'm really uncomfortable.

34:11.850 --> 34:15.187
- Katie, Kristen, and Stassi,
we've heard rumblings

34:15.221 --> 34:18.590
that there may have been
more going on between them

34:18.624 --> 34:21.360
than just substance abuse.

34:21.393 --> 34:23.495
Had you had those theories?

34:23.529 --> 34:25.097
- We wanted to protect her.

34:25.131 --> 34:27.199
- Yeah, I mean,
I was there

34:27.233 --> 34:29.168
when she saw the text messages.

34:29.201 --> 34:31.503
However she wanted to handle it,
I was gonna support that.

34:31.537 --> 34:34.806
- You had a sexting relationship
with a woman.

34:34.840 --> 34:37.376
Is there more?
I mean...

34:37.409 --> 34:38.510
- Isn't that enough?

34:38.544 --> 34:39.845
- No, it is enough.

34:39.878 --> 34:41.113
I mean, I'm just--

34:41.147 --> 34:42.148
- I mean, those were
the big issues,

34:42.181 --> 34:44.216
and then that turned into
a bunch of small issues:

34:44.250 --> 34:45.784
lack of communicating...

34:45.817 --> 34:47.619
- Then why didn't you
bring that out in the beginning?

34:47.653 --> 34:49.321
- Because I had too much pride.

34:49.355 --> 34:51.623
- You threw me under the bus
by telling--

34:51.657 --> 34:54.560
I was six months past, like,
not taking anything,

34:54.593 --> 34:56.328
and I was on a roll with that.

34:56.362 --> 35:00.132
Then you ran and you told Lisa
about pills on camera

35:00.166 --> 35:01.267
to cover your ass.

35:01.300 --> 35:03.402
- It was because
you hurt me that bad

35:03.435 --> 35:05.471
that I wanted to do what I could
to hurt you back.

35:05.504 --> 35:06.572
- You've hurt me so many times,

35:06.605 --> 35:07.906
and I have not
f---ing hurt you.

35:07.939 --> 35:10.542
- At the time,
I had too much pride...

35:10.576 --> 35:12.211
- And that hurt.

35:12.244 --> 35:14.480
- To let every Brandi follower
be like, "That's your karma.

35:14.513 --> 35:16.148
That's what you get."

35:16.182 --> 35:18.217
- Oh, you're the girl
that had sex with my husband.

35:18.250 --> 35:19.351
- Brandi?

35:19.385 --> 35:22.288
I kind of used to date
her husband.

35:22.321 --> 35:25.457
So I threw him under the bus,
'cause he hurt me.

35:25.491 --> 35:26.492
That's what I do.

35:26.525 --> 35:28.360
You hurt me,
I f--- you over.

35:28.394 --> 35:31.463
- I can't even look at you
right now, man.

35:31.497 --> 35:32.931
- Shay, do you think
your addiction issues

35:32.964 --> 35:35.867
are something that you would
have brought up on your own?

35:35.901 --> 35:37.236
- Never.
- No?

35:37.269 --> 35:39.271
- That was something that was--
it's--

35:39.305 --> 35:41.640
that I was dealing with
with my wife,

35:41.673 --> 35:43.442
between us.

35:43.475 --> 35:44.676
My parents didn't know.

35:44.710 --> 35:46.412
My family didn't know.

35:46.445 --> 35:47.913
So I was forced
to tell everyone,

35:47.946 --> 35:50.916
and now I--anywhere I go,
I get it every day.

35:50.949 --> 35:52.584
I'm labeled as a druggie

35:52.618 --> 35:55.454
and labeled as just, like--
I'm labeled forever.

35:55.487 --> 35:56.655
- I know.
I'm a homewrecking whore.

35:56.688 --> 35:59.291
You get labeled,
and it just doesn't leave you.

35:59.325 --> 36:01.660
I'm sorry that that came out,
but that was--

36:01.693 --> 36:03.229
- I didn't label you that,
though.

36:03.262 --> 36:05.231
You labeled yourself that.

36:07.533 --> 36:08.667
- It is what it is.

36:08.700 --> 36:10.469
- So that's basically
a great example

36:10.502 --> 36:12.538
of how she treated me.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.908
- I never would have left you.

36:16.942 --> 36:19.478
I would have just stayed
in a marriage

36:19.511 --> 36:20.912
that wasn't great and--

36:20.946 --> 36:21.947
- That's not true.

36:21.980 --> 36:23.215
- I would have never
divorced you.

36:23.249 --> 36:24.350
- That's not true,
because--

36:24.383 --> 36:25.917
- I would have divorced you
last year if I was going to.

36:25.951 --> 36:27.353
- That's not true.
I told you.

36:27.386 --> 36:28.954
I said,
"We will make this work."

36:28.987 --> 36:30.155
And you said "yes"
to everything.

36:30.188 --> 36:33.392
Then when I showed up to film,
you divorced me on camera.

36:34.526 --> 36:36.928
- I found out you were
buying pills behind my back

36:36.962 --> 36:37.829
and still lying to me.

36:37.863 --> 36:41.267
Right then, I was, like,
checked out, done.

36:41.300 --> 36:44.403
- Oh, God.

36:44.436 --> 36:47.373
- Shay, when you read online

36:47.406 --> 36:49.241
that Scheana has
a new boyfriend,

36:49.275 --> 36:51.577
does that--
what does that do to your heart?

36:51.610 --> 36:53.379
- Uh...

36:53.412 --> 36:55.647
it's unfortunate.

36:55.681 --> 37:00.252
You having a new boyfriend,
I think, is very quick.

37:00.286 --> 37:03.355
I don't know who he is.
I don't care to know.

37:03.389 --> 37:05.223
- You follow him on Instagram.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.494
- Who--I don't.

37:08.527 --> 37:09.661
- Rob.

37:09.695 --> 37:11.663
- That's the guy you're dating?

37:11.697 --> 37:13.432
- Mm-hmm.

37:16.468 --> 37:18.470
- Hmm, interesting.

37:18.504 --> 37:20.272
- You know him?

37:20.306 --> 37:21.607
- Yeah.

37:21.640 --> 37:23.675
- We've been friends
for over ten years.

37:23.709 --> 37:25.477
- That's another thing.

37:25.511 --> 37:27.313
I don't--I don't go--
I'm not on social media.

37:27.346 --> 37:29.047
I don't--that's why
I unfollowed everyone:

37:29.080 --> 37:30.949
so I wouldn't see
pictures of you,

37:30.982 --> 37:32.551
because I couldn't get over--

37:32.584 --> 37:34.286
I would see a picture of you
and just be like, "Damn.

37:34.320 --> 37:36.955
Like, I miss her."

37:36.988 --> 37:38.757
I'm--this is really hard.
Sorry.

37:38.790 --> 37:41.393
- It's all right, man.
Take your time.

37:41.427 --> 37:42.528
- It's all right, dude.

37:42.561 --> 37:45.397
- I just have a lot of emotions
going on right now.

37:45.431 --> 37:46.432
Um...

37:46.465 --> 37:48.800
- Are you seeing anyone?
- No.

37:48.834 --> 37:51.603
I'm still technically married,
so...

37:54.406 --> 37:57.075
- Doesn't feel like it, though.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.311
It's just a piece of paper
at this point.

37:59.345 --> 38:01.980
- You know, I--
I'll always love you.

38:02.013 --> 38:04.316
- Oh!
- I'll always, like--

38:04.350 --> 38:05.817
You know,
if you ever need something,

38:05.851 --> 38:06.985
you know I'd be there.

38:07.018 --> 38:10.055
But at this point, I'm--

38:10.088 --> 38:12.458
I don't want to--
it's hard to say,

38:12.491 --> 38:15.461
but I'm--I'm over
our relationship.

38:15.494 --> 38:17.996
And coming here was
something I had to do.

38:18.029 --> 38:20.499
I mean, it was a lot harder
than I thought it would be,

38:20.532 --> 38:22.334
but I'm glad I did.

38:22.368 --> 38:23.602
- Let me ask you this.

38:23.635 --> 38:27.773
Scheana, does it give you
any closure or peace

38:27.806 --> 38:33.345
to hear him say, "I love you,
I'm always here for you"?

38:33.379 --> 38:37.015
- Yeah, I mean,
I didn't really know

38:37.048 --> 38:39.451
what to expect.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.855
From what I hear
from other people

38:43.889 --> 38:46.792
who follow you on Snapchat,
you seem to be very happy,

38:46.825 --> 38:48.560
and I think you're
in your happy place.

38:48.594 --> 38:51.663
And I'm in a very happy place
right now as well,

38:51.697 --> 38:55.066
so, I mean, I'm happy for you.

38:56.402 --> 38:59.538
- I know this is very hard
for you both,

38:59.571 --> 39:03.108
and I hope that...

39:03.141 --> 39:05.611
you found some peace.

39:05.644 --> 39:07.613
- It's an incredible tragedy,
but I feel like,

39:07.646 --> 39:09.381
as hard as it was,
I feel like you guys

39:09.415 --> 39:10.882
are gonna go off
in different directions

39:10.916 --> 39:13.585
and be happier than you ever
could have been together.

39:13.619 --> 39:16.154
- Okay.
Well, thank you, Shay.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.457
- Thank you.
- We'll be right back.

39:18.490 --> 39:21.092
- Thank you.

39:21.126 --> 39:23.495
- I wish you well.
- Thank you so much.

39:23.529 --> 39:25.697
- Good luck with your tour.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.770
[soft music]

39:31.803 --> 39:38.744
*

39:40.145 --> 39:42.814
- You brought up the idea
of opening a new bar with him.

39:42.848 --> 39:45.116
- I--I get emotional
thinking about it.

39:45.150 --> 39:46.284
- You're crying now.
Stop.

39:46.317 --> 39:48.620
- What is wrong with me, man?
- What is wrong with you?

39:51.557 --> 39:53.959
[light music]

39:53.992 --> 39:55.694
- Back with our final moments

39:55.727 --> 39:58.997
with Lisa Vanderpump
and the Sur gang.

39:59.030 --> 40:02.033
James has been slapped around
all season

40:02.067 --> 40:03.935
for his horrible behavior.

40:03.969 --> 40:07.873
He made it through 18 hours
with all of you.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.175
You know,
he's been cracking Jax up

40:10.208 --> 40:11.443
for the entire time.

40:11.477 --> 40:12.711
- My new buddy today.

40:12.744 --> 40:14.045
- This is
the best reunion ever.

40:14.079 --> 40:15.847
I mean, for me.
I'm sorry.

40:15.881 --> 40:17.716
[laughter]
- Jax. Jax.

40:17.749 --> 40:19.117
- Hey, me and Schwartz
and you and James,

40:19.150 --> 40:20.118
we'll go on a double date.

40:20.151 --> 40:21.787
[laughter]
- I like that.

40:21.820 --> 40:24.055
- Lisa, at the wedding,
you pulled Sandoval aside,

40:24.089 --> 40:28.026
and you brought up the idea
of opening a new bar with him.

40:28.059 --> 40:32.798
- He's a great bartender,
and I know he's ambitious,

40:32.831 --> 40:34.466
and I thought it would be
a great fit.

40:34.500 --> 40:35.834
- That's a massive compliment.

40:35.867 --> 40:38.103
- I was--yeah,
I was extremely flattered.

40:38.136 --> 40:40.572
I--I get emotional
thinking about it.

40:40.606 --> 40:42.508
Like, that was--

40:45.176 --> 40:46.812
- You're crying now.
Stop.

40:46.845 --> 40:48.179
- What is wrong with me, man?
- What is wrong with you?

40:48.213 --> 40:50.516
- Schwartz, Lisa couldn't even
finish the offer

40:50.549 --> 40:52.150
before you started screaming,
"No."

40:52.183 --> 40:54.019
- "No."
- No, I can't.

40:54.052 --> 40:55.253
That's too much pressure on me.

40:55.286 --> 40:56.988
If it fails, it's on us.

40:57.022 --> 41:00.959
- Are you that allergic
to work or responsibility?

41:00.992 --> 41:01.960
Commitment?

41:01.993 --> 41:05.030
- My first instinct was,
I don't want to tarnish

41:05.063 --> 41:09.200
your reputation, your name
with my lack of experience.

41:09.234 --> 41:11.837
- Tom, this is what upsets me.
- You always doubt yourself.

41:11.870 --> 41:13.171
- You doubt, and you
don't know your potential.

41:13.204 --> 41:14.940
You always think, "I'm not
the right guy for that.

41:14.973 --> 41:16.975
No, there's guys
that are better than that."

41:17.008 --> 41:19.945
- Katie, you've been married
to this guy for 15 minutes

41:19.978 --> 41:22.180
before he stamps out
his opportunity

41:22.213 --> 41:23.515
to work for Lisa Vanderpump,

41:23.549 --> 41:25.283
be partners
with Lisa Vanderpump.

41:25.316 --> 41:27.919
How did you react
when he told you about it?

41:27.953 --> 41:29.287
- He, like,
didn't tell me about it,

41:29.320 --> 41:31.623
probably because I would have,
like, wrung his neck

41:31.657 --> 41:32.991
and been like, "Why are you
not doing this?"

41:33.024 --> 41:34.893
- What's the update
with Tom Tom Club?

41:34.926 --> 41:36.061
- Well, I still have
the premises,

41:36.094 --> 41:37.629
and I would still go ahead,

41:37.663 --> 41:41.099
but it clearly wouldn't be
Tom Tom, would it?

41:41.132 --> 41:42.534
- If they don't get
their act together,

41:42.568 --> 41:44.069
it could become Lala's Lounge.

41:44.102 --> 41:46.237
- Exactly.
[laughter]

41:46.271 --> 41:49.074
- You know what moment
I enjoyed from the wedding?

41:49.107 --> 41:50.108
- What was that?

41:50.141 --> 41:52.210
- You and Stassi
doing a booty bump.

41:52.243 --> 41:53.845
- Back it up.

41:53.879 --> 41:54.880
[upbeat music]

41:54.913 --> 41:58.550
Why are you skinnier
than anybody I ever am around?

41:58.584 --> 42:00.886
I'm so excited to post that.

42:00.919 --> 42:01.987
I got video of it.

42:02.020 --> 42:05.891
- I feel like you and Stassi
have come together, Lisa.

42:05.924 --> 42:07.225
- No, you're exaggerating.

42:07.258 --> 42:09.861
- Well, a booty bump...
[laughter]

42:09.895 --> 42:14.032
We should wrap this season up,
as we always do,

42:14.065 --> 42:17.669
with Ken, some puppies, Peter,
and some cocktails.

42:17.703 --> 42:18.904
- Yay!

42:18.937 --> 42:20.105
- Aw!

42:20.138 --> 42:22.974
[people exclaiming]

42:23.008 --> 42:25.577
[various conversations]

42:29.648 --> 42:32.250
- Here's to
another incredible year

42:32.283 --> 42:34.986
watching your
unbelievable choices,

42:35.020 --> 42:37.022
sometimes questionable,

42:37.055 --> 42:38.990
and journey going forward.

42:39.024 --> 42:40.125
I love each and every one
of you,

42:40.158 --> 42:42.160
even though sometimes
I don't show it.

42:42.193 --> 42:44.596
- Cheers, guys.
all: Cheers.

42:44.630 --> 42:46.264
- To the next chapter
of our lives.

42:46.297 --> 42:49.334
- Whoops.
- Cheers, everybody.

42:49.367 --> 42:51.002
- Cheers.
- Whoo!

42:51.036 --> 42:54.005
- I'm drinking this thing.
