00:00.306 --> 00:03.874
Narrator: On this illuminating
episode of "MythBusters"...

00:03.876 --> 00:05.309
Ah.

00:05.311 --> 00:06.810
There went his first glass.

00:06.812 --> 00:09.268
Narrator:
...Adam and Jamie have a smashing time...

00:09.270 --> 00:12.203
I can see nothing! This is insane!

00:12.205 --> 00:14.998
...as they reflect on
something truly enlightening.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.796
Adam: It looks great. I didn't think
it would be this good.

00:17.798 --> 00:19.827
Narrator:
Can you really use mirrors and the sun...

00:19.829 --> 00:22.933
Behold! I am the master of the sun!

00:22.935 --> 00:25.270
...as a form of ancient lighting?

00:25.272 --> 00:28.078
- There it is. Doink!
- Man, that's bright.

00:28.080 --> 00:30.346
Narrator: Then, Tory, Grant, and Kari...

00:30.348 --> 00:32.951
Grant: - Ha!
Tory: - That was hairball.

00:32.953 --> 00:34.988
...investigate a freeway fable...

00:34.990 --> 00:36.822
Grant: I think there are some
law-enforcement people

00:36.824 --> 00:38.926
who would be very
interested in talking to us.

00:38.928 --> 00:41.929
Narrator: ...that you can slow down
an out-of-control vehicle...

00:41.931 --> 00:44.867
Kari:
Your idea of a safe stop is to shank me?

00:44.869 --> 00:48.172
Narrator:
...by playing bumper cars on the blacktop.

00:48.174 --> 00:50.173
Tory: We're on the road to madness!

00:52.808 --> 00:54.509
Narrator: Who are the MythBusters?

00:55.812 --> 00:57.746
- Adam Savage...
- Whoo!

00:57.748 --> 00:58.981
What more did you need to know?

00:58.983 --> 01:00.249
...and Jamie Hyneman.

01:00.251 --> 01:02.119
When in doubt, C-4.

01:02.121 --> 01:07.125
Between them, more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

01:07.127 --> 01:09.761
Joining them... Grant Imahara...

01:09.763 --> 01:11.663
It's lethal, people!

01:11.665 --> 01:14.598
- ...Kari Byron...
- Jamie just doesn't look right.

01:14.600 --> 01:17.700
- ...and Tory Belleci.
- And touchdown.

01:17.702 --> 01:19.702
They don't just tell the myths,

01:19.704 --> 01:22.804

- I've got a story for you to reflect on.
- Hit me.

01:37.015 --> 01:39.750
I <i>will</i> hit you... with the sun's rays.

01:39.752 --> 01:41.919
In the film "The Mummy", there's a scene

01:41.921 --> 01:44.554
in which the hero has to
go deep into a dark tomb,

01:44.556 --> 01:45.956
and in order to light his way,

01:45.958 --> 01:49.160
he kicks into gear a system
of ancient Egyptian mirrors

01:49.162 --> 01:52.129
which bounce the sun's rays from outside

01:52.131 --> 01:55.099
deep into the bowels of the cavernous tomb,

01:55.101 --> 01:56.567
so that they can navigate safely.

01:56.569 --> 01:57.734
How enlightened.

01:57.736 --> 01:59.937
Well, that's the question, isn't it?

01:59.939 --> 02:01.405
That's the question.

02:01.407 --> 02:02.639
And here's the clip.

02:02.641 --> 02:05.408
Sunlight is bounced into the mummy's tomb.

02:05.410 --> 02:08.978
"And then there was light".

02:08.979 --> 02:13.748
But is this ancient
illumination really possible?

02:13.750 --> 02:15.416
So, what do you want to do first?

02:15.418 --> 02:18.152
Well, look, this myth is all
about lighting up the darkness

02:18.154 --> 02:19.721
with the sun's rays reflected.

02:19.723 --> 02:21.356
We need to answer the question...

02:21.358 --> 02:23.558
what does it mean to light up the darkness?

02:23.560 --> 02:25.894
We need to define that...
what's the minimum amount

02:25.896 --> 02:28.430
of light necessary to move
around in an unfamiliar space?

02:28.432 --> 02:30.598
Exactly, and I think I've got

02:30.600 --> 02:33.201
just the procedure to test this out.

02:33.203 --> 02:35.770
- Okay...
- Oh, don't worry. You're gonna love it.

02:37.172 --> 02:39.973
Before we start bouncing light
around the shop with mirrors,

02:39.975 --> 02:42.108
we need to determine a couple of benchmarks

02:42.110 --> 02:43.977
that we'll be aiming for in these tests.

02:43.979 --> 02:46.646
The first one we've determined
is the Hollywood benchmark.

02:46.648 --> 02:48.014
This is the amount of lighting

02:48.016 --> 02:49.849
that they used while filming the film

02:49.851 --> 02:52.251
that properly tells the
story of a light beam

02:52.253 --> 02:55.153
bouncing around with
mirrors and lighting up a room.

02:55.155 --> 02:56.921
The second benchmark is what I consider

02:56.923 --> 02:58.690
to be the heart and soul of this story,

02:58.692 --> 03:01.093
and it is, what is the minimum amount

03:01.095 --> 03:04.263
of ambient light required to see?

03:05.532 --> 03:08.100
Narrator:
So, step one is finding the minimum

03:08.102 --> 03:10.336
benchmark light level needed to see by,

03:10.338 --> 03:14.674
and Adam's brain wave to
test it is a makeshift maze.

03:14.676 --> 03:17.444
Adam: We are going to try and make
it through this obstacle course

03:17.446 --> 03:18.712
under very low-light conditions

03:18.714 --> 03:20.480
to determine the minimum light conditions

03:20.482 --> 03:22.115
you can make it through
this obstacle course

03:22.117 --> 03:24.051
without breaking anything.

03:24.053 --> 03:27.288
[ glass shatters, clinking ]

03:27.290 --> 03:28.756
That's the sound of failure.

03:28.758 --> 03:30.458
Narrator: With the course set,

03:30.460 --> 03:32.326
the guys focus on benchmark one...

03:32.328 --> 03:34.228
the Hollywood level of illumination.

03:34.230 --> 03:35.797
Jamie: I'm all set.

03:35.799 --> 03:37.432
That means playing with the light level

03:37.434 --> 03:40.668
until it matches that of the movie...

03:40.670 --> 03:42.036
Jamie: Okay, that works for me.

03:42.038 --> 03:44.439
...and then record the lux level.

03:44.441 --> 03:46.174
We're gonna measure our ambient-light level

03:46.176 --> 03:47.542
using a meter like this one,

03:47.544 --> 03:50.245
which receives light in
through the sensor here

03:50.247 --> 03:52.547
and converts that to an electrical signal.

03:52.549 --> 03:54.582
Now, our computer converts that signal

03:54.584 --> 03:57.318
into what is known as lux.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.887
Narrator:
In the days when candles were king,

03:59.889 --> 04:01.923
scientists determined that one lux

04:01.925 --> 04:05.526
is the amount of illumination
that falls over one square meter

04:05.528 --> 04:08.028
if a candle is set one meter away.

04:08.030 --> 04:09.395
Using this scale,

04:09.397 --> 04:13.833
about 300 lux is the minimum
level needed to read by.

04:13.835 --> 04:17.737
But how many lux is the movie scene?

04:17.738 --> 04:20.440
To find out, it's trial by tweaking

04:20.442 --> 04:24.477
as the MythBusters crank
up the levels bit by bit.

04:24.479 --> 04:26.546
201 lux.

04:26.548 --> 04:28.482
And with a benefit of a jump cut or two...

04:28.484 --> 04:29.850
That ought to do it.

04:29.852 --> 04:31.418
...they soon find the level

04:31.420 --> 04:34.754
they think is a lux
look-alike for "The Mummy".

04:34.756 --> 04:37.691
Adam: This looks great. It
looks just like the movie.

04:37.693 --> 04:41.161
Okay. That gives us an average of 200 lux.

04:41.163 --> 04:43.996
Narrator:
So, that's the Hollywood level sorted.

04:43.998 --> 04:46.231
How will benchmark two compare?

04:46.233 --> 04:48.533
Adam's got a plan.

04:48.535 --> 04:50.302
Since the archaeologists in this myth

04:50.304 --> 04:52.170
went from the bright sun into the tomb,

04:52.172 --> 04:53.472
we're gonna do the same thing.

04:53.474 --> 04:55.240
Here I am in Jamie's electronics room

04:55.242 --> 04:57.542
with two lights simulating the bright sun.

04:57.544 --> 05:00.077
I will then leave the electronics room

05:00.079 --> 05:02.480
and walk down the tunnel of Osiris,

05:02.482 --> 05:06.317
otherwise known as Jamie's
battery-and-wire storage shelf.

05:06.319 --> 05:09.153
I will then enter the main shop
area, which will be pitch-black,

05:09.155 --> 05:11.956
and I'll use this rope to guide myself

05:11.958 --> 05:13.357
out into the middle of the shop.

05:13.359 --> 05:15.259
And when I hit the knot...

05:15.261 --> 05:17.895
I turn and start to walk
the obstacle course.

05:17.897 --> 05:21.533
The question is, what is the
minimum amount of light required

05:21.535 --> 05:23.702
for me to walk this obstacle course...

05:23.704 --> 05:25.770
[ glass shatters ]

05:25.772 --> 05:27.472
...without breaking anything?

05:27.474 --> 05:28.941
It's not gonna be easy.

05:28.943 --> 05:31.877
Narrator: To find out, Adam set
his overhead light source

05:31.879 --> 05:33.980
to its bare-minimum setting.

05:33.982 --> 05:36.849
Okay, Adam. Go ahead and do your thing.

05:36.851 --> 05:38.317
Adam: All right. Here I go.

05:38.319 --> 05:41.654
Jamie monitors progress
on an infrared camera.

05:41.656 --> 05:43.255
Holy crap.

05:43.257 --> 05:44.523
There he is.

05:44.525 --> 05:46.558
I can see nothing. [ glass shatters ]

05:46.560 --> 05:48.160
Narrator: And for those of you

05:48.162 --> 05:50.528
who find the sound of
breaking glass disturbing,

05:50.530 --> 05:53.731
now might be a good time
to switch your set to "mute".

05:53.733 --> 05:55.332
Oh !@#*!

05:55.334 --> 05:57.468
This is... I'm the worst
archaeologist ever!

05:58.538 --> 06:01.005

06:01.007 --> 06:02.941
as Adam...

06:02.943 --> 06:04.309
This is insane!

06:04.311 --> 06:06.979
...stumbles his way through
the wineglass maze.

06:06.981 --> 06:08.748
Here I am. I made it to the end.

06:08.750 --> 06:10.750
And it's clear this light level

06:10.752 --> 06:13.152
is far too low for the human-eye test.

06:13.154 --> 06:16.156
[ laughs ] That was a horror show.

06:16.158 --> 06:19.292
Jamie: You pretty much broke every
glass that was in your path.

06:19.294 --> 06:21.727
Yeah, I think we need to
tune up the lights a little bit.

06:21.729 --> 06:23.195
Let's make it a little brighter

06:23.197 --> 06:24.897
and see if I can't make out
some of these shapes.

06:24.899 --> 06:26.231
Okay.

06:26.233 --> 06:28.335
I'll replace the glasses.

06:29.737 --> 06:31.970
Adam tries a slightly
increased light level...

06:31.972 --> 06:34.506
There we go. One notch up.

06:34.508 --> 06:35.841

06:47.623 --> 06:48.722
Oh, my eyes are adjusting.

06:48.724 --> 06:50.558
Yeah, he's doing a lot better, actually.

06:50.560 --> 06:52.060
It's still a blur. Ohh!
[ glass shatters ]

06:52.062 --> 06:53.628

And after a disappointing start...

07:01.538 --> 07:02.804
[ glass shatters ] ...seven.

07:02.806 --> 07:06.740
...it soon becomes another
catacomb catastrophe.

07:06.742 --> 07:08.609
So they increase the light level again...

07:08.611 --> 07:10.543
[ glass shatters ]

...and again...

six that Adam finally makes it.

This is it. This is the light level.

07:28.662 --> 07:30.362
Narrator: So, they break out the luxmeter

07:30.364 --> 07:33.900
to shed some science on this final setting.

07:34.502 --> 07:36.502
What's the verdict? How dim was it?

07:36.704 --> 07:39.238
I get .389 of a lux.

07:39.240 --> 07:40.739
- Of ambient light?
- Yeah.

07:40.741 --> 07:42.774
That is amazingly dim.

07:42.776 --> 07:47.044
At 0.39 lux, the minimum human-eye level

07:47.046 --> 07:50.815
is 500 times dimmer than Hollywood.

07:50.817 --> 07:53.651
And with both benchmarks in the bag,

07:53.653 --> 07:55.719
the question now is,

07:55.721 --> 07:59.623
can bouncing light with mirrors
beat either benchmark?

08:13.106 --> 08:15.974
is all about driving fast, out of control,

08:15.976 --> 08:17.575
and it's totally dangerous.

08:19.079 --> 08:20.812
Could you... if a car was out of control,

could you overtake them,
get in front of them,

08:23.316 --> 08:24.682
and then slow down

08:24.684 --> 08:26.918
till you brought that

So, as if they had fallen
asleep or had a heart attack.

08:30.056 --> 08:31.956
- Exactly.
- Great. Let's try it.

When a driver passes out at the wheel,

08:34.360 --> 08:37.294
things get very bad very fast,

08:37.296 --> 08:39.730
but does it have to end up like this?

08:39.732 --> 08:41.097
[ tires screech, crash ]

08:41.100 --> 08:44.034
Well, apparently not, because
according to this myth,

08:44.035 --> 08:47.837
you can safely stop a runaway
car by overtaking it,

08:47.974 --> 08:50.708
then carefully bringing it to a standstill.

08:50.710 --> 08:53.611
Freeway fact or blacktop baloney?

08:53.613 --> 08:55.813
Okay, as I see it, we have two scenarios.

08:55.815 --> 08:58.417
First, the driver has lost
total control of the car

08:58.419 --> 09:00.619
and has no influence over it at all.

09:00.621 --> 09:03.389
There's no steering, and
the foot is off the accelerator.

09:03.391 --> 09:04.857
So just coasting, then.

09:04.859 --> 09:06.091
Exactly.

09:06.093 --> 09:08.360
The second scenario
is a little more extreme.

09:08.362 --> 09:09.996
There's still no steering,

09:09.998 --> 09:12.298
but the foot's jammed
onto the accelerator.

09:12.300 --> 09:13.499
Would <i>that</i> make a difference?

go to stunt-driving school.

I mean, if this myth is
about a car out of control,

09:19.608 --> 09:21.141
we need to see what it feels like

09:21.143 --> 09:22.842

more polished performer?

Obviously, the glass mirror
is more reflective,

14:47.607 --> 14:49.674

14:49.676 --> 14:52.511
It may be the case that the metal mirror

14:52.513 --> 14:54.546

give a cleaner beam,

15:59.378 --> 16:01.178
the ambient light they give off

18:38.875 --> 18:43.276
Narrator: The 35-mile-an-hour,
no-hands test is down.

18:43.278 --> 18:47.046
Now they're about to up the
danger to freeway speed.

18:47.048 --> 18:48.481
Kari: For this next test,

18:48.483 --> 18:50.383
there's gonna be a little
more jeopardy here,

18:50.385 --> 18:52.785
because that all is great as
long as you're going straight.

18:52.787 --> 18:54.787
We're gonna be passed out at the wheel.

18:54.789 --> 18:57.456
The alignment's not amazing
on this salvaged vehicle,

18:57.458 --> 18:59.358
and we're going double the speed.

18:59.360 --> 19:02.495
Tory: Here we go, in three, two, one, go.

19:02.497 --> 19:05.131
Narrator:
55... plus different-height bumpers...

19:05.133 --> 19:06.967
plus dodgy alignment.

19:06.969 --> 19:09.302
Oh, and no hands, either.

19:09.304 --> 19:10.504
30 miles an hour.

19:13.175 --> 19:15.610
55 miles an hour.

19:15.612 --> 19:17.779
This is too exciting to pass out.

19:17.781 --> 19:19.047
But here we go.

19:19.049 --> 19:21.417
Kari: - This is actually kind of scary.
- I know.

19:21.419 --> 19:22.985
All right. We're passing out.

19:22.987 --> 19:24.320
Hand is off of the wheel.

19:24.322 --> 19:26.955
With Kari comatose behind the wheel,

19:26.957 --> 19:28.824
Grant brakes in front.

19:28.826 --> 19:31.360
If he's a whisker off dead center,

19:31.362 --> 19:33.662
one car or other could spin out.

19:33.664 --> 19:36.098
It's a totally tricky maneuver.

19:36.100 --> 19:37.566
Here we go. Oh.

19:40.637 --> 19:43.138
Ruff: All right! Nice work!

19:43.140 --> 19:45.173
Grant: Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

19:45.175 --> 19:49.245
Uh, that was a little scary, got to say.

19:49.247 --> 19:51.180
It's a lot more challenging,

19:51.182 --> 19:53.482
and at 20 miles an hour,

19:53.484 --> 19:55.718
the corrections are sort of gentle.

19:55.720 --> 19:58.621
At 55, the corrections
have to be a lot faster,

19:58.623 --> 20:01.090
and so it's hard to do it really smooth.

20:01.092 --> 20:04.260
But it worked. We're alive!

20:04.262 --> 20:05.928
It worked at 55 miles an hour.

20:05.930 --> 20:09.031
And, look, our hood is almost
underneath your bumper,

20:09.033 --> 20:10.333
and we didn't lose control.

20:10.335 --> 20:12.502
Narrator: But having survived at 55,

20:12.504 --> 20:15.071
can they let it rest at that?

20:15.073 --> 20:16.839
What if the accelerator were stuck...

20:16.841 --> 20:19.642
Yeah, like, if the guy passes out
and his foot's stuck on the gas.

20:19.644 --> 20:21.577
...Or there was some sort of malfunction?

20:21.579 --> 20:24.680
I like it. Add more danger
to this experiment.

20:24.682 --> 20:27.183
All right. Let's do it.

20:31.959 --> 20:34.227
Narrator:
Adam and Jamie have been reflecting

20:34.229 --> 20:36.730
on some proof-of-concept tests at the shop.

20:36.732 --> 20:39.866
The average ambient light
of the polished metal...

20:39.868 --> 20:42.002
1.13 lux.

20:42.004 --> 20:44.404
Can you really use mirrors
to turn dark into day?

20:44.406 --> 20:46.306
Adam: This is more than enough light

20:46.308 --> 20:48.175
for me to make it through that maze.

20:48.177 --> 20:51.179
Narrator:
It's certainly a case of "so far, so good".

20:51.181 --> 20:53.414
But will these results scale up?

20:53.416 --> 20:56.918
Will using the real sun
and a much larger crypt

20:56.920 --> 20:59.287
be the making of this myth?

20:59.289 --> 21:00.922
Well, this is the place.

21:00.924 --> 21:02.190
Looks great.

21:02.192 --> 21:04.025
Okay, it's not ancient Egypt...

21:04.027 --> 21:06.026
[ laughs ] Shall I open it up?

21:06.028 --> 21:07.261
Absolutely.

21:07.263 --> 21:10.330
...but Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay

21:10.332 --> 21:14.535
uncovers an unexpected
underground treasure.

21:14.537 --> 21:16.303
Well, shall we set up?

21:16.305 --> 21:18.038
Let's turn on the house lights.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.541
All right. House lights up.

21:20.643 --> 21:22.043
Well, this is our space.

21:22.045 --> 21:23.545
Now, it's not a tomb,

21:23.547 --> 21:26.214
but it is underground,
and it's very, very dark,

21:26.216 --> 21:28.584
so it'll be perfect for our testing.

21:29.720 --> 21:33.756
Narrator: Jamie blocks out a few spots
to make total darkness.

21:33.758 --> 21:35.024
Jamie: There we go.

21:35.960 --> 21:37.594
Narrator: Meanwhile, Adam's manufacturing

21:37.596 --> 21:39.596
modern glass mirrors.

21:39.598 --> 21:42.598
Now, I'll wager you're probably
yelling at the screen right now,

21:42.600 --> 21:45.168
wondering why I am building
these with glass mirrors

21:45.170 --> 21:46.669
when our polished metal mirrors

21:46.671 --> 21:49.071
actually gave us a higher
ambient-light reading.

21:49.073 --> 21:51.373
1.13 lux.

21:51.375 --> 21:53.108
This is probably easiest to explain

21:53.110 --> 21:54.843
if you take a look at these two shots

21:54.845 --> 21:56.678
our cameramen filmed this morning.

21:56.680 --> 21:58.647
On the left are the polished metal mirrors.

21:58.649 --> 22:00.015
On the right, the glass.

22:00.017 --> 22:02.218
Now, see how the light from
the polished metal mirrors

22:02.220 --> 22:03.553
peters out really fast?

22:03.555 --> 22:05.422
Compare that to the glass mirrors,

22:05.424 --> 22:06.757
where the light is strong

22:06.759 --> 22:08.592
virtually all the way to the end,

22:08.594 --> 22:10.894
and that's what's really important.

22:10.896 --> 22:13.464
This myth isn't about the
type of mirror you use.

22:13.466 --> 22:15.433
It's about bouncing a beam of light,

22:15.435 --> 22:17.601
and the polished metal
didn't give us that beam.

22:17.603 --> 22:20.271
It only lasted about 15 feet
before it was diffused.

22:20.273 --> 22:22.640
That's why the glass is what we're using

22:22.642 --> 22:25.577
in our full-size tomb.

22:25.579 --> 22:27.411
Narrator: And with that cleared up,

22:27.413 --> 22:30.882
there's just one more
ingredient left... the sun.

22:30.884 --> 22:32.117
Jamie: Now all we need to do

22:32.119 --> 22:34.386
is see if the sun's gonna
cooperate with us,

22:34.388 --> 22:36.388
and that's actually a pretty big if,

22:36.390 --> 22:38.690
because not only do we have to worry

22:38.692 --> 22:41.359
about whether we can reflect
sun into the building...

22:41.361 --> 22:44.597
in other words, is it lined up
at a decent angle for that?...

22:44.599 --> 22:46.532
but also, this is San Francisco,

22:46.534 --> 22:48.935
and it's regularly kind of foggy here.

22:48.937 --> 22:51.271
If we have a few too many clouds,

22:51.273 --> 22:52.606
we're gonna be out of business.

22:52.608 --> 22:55.142
Narrator:
Yep, without the big guy in the sky,

22:55.144 --> 22:57.177
the tomb's doomed.

22:57.179 --> 23:02.749
Well, I can see the sun,
but it is awfully overcast.

23:02.751 --> 23:05.518
It is what it is.

23:05.520 --> 23:07.754
Narrator:
So, with San Francisco's fickle weather

23:07.756 --> 23:10.723
doing its darndest to delay things,

23:10.725 --> 23:12.725
Adam has a backup plan.

23:12.727 --> 23:14.626
Adam: Have you met my sun?

23:14.628 --> 23:17.529
It is a 7,000-watt xenon spotlight.

23:17.531 --> 23:19.064
I'm gonna turn it on now.

23:20.266 --> 23:22.634
Ohh!

23:22.636 --> 23:24.937
Look at that puppy.

23:24.939 --> 23:26.972
Boom!

23:26.974 --> 23:30.109
Behold! I am the master of the sun!

23:30.111 --> 23:31.777
[ laughs evilly ]

23:31.779 --> 23:33.245
Narrator: Adam's humongous light source

23:33.247 --> 23:37.283
gives a whopping 160,000 lux at 50 feet.

23:37.285 --> 23:39.385
[ Adam laughs ]

23:39.387 --> 23:41.887
That is freaking awesome.

23:41.889 --> 23:43.289
Narrator: But will it be bright enough

23:43.291 --> 23:45.458
to illuminate their colossal crypt?

23:45.460 --> 23:46.559
Adam: I think that's right.

23:46.561 --> 23:47.894
Narrator: To find out,

23:47.896 --> 23:49.596
the guys will shine in Adam's sun,

23:49.598 --> 23:52.900
position the mirrors, and
then check the light reading,

23:52.902 --> 23:55.535
starting now.

23:55.537 --> 23:57.237
House lights out.

23:58.439 --> 24:00.073
Shall we bring in the sun?

24:00.075 --> 24:01.907
Sure. Why not?

24:01.909 --> 24:03.309
Let's bring in the first sunbeam.

24:05.645 --> 24:07.079
All right. You ready for it?

24:07.081 --> 24:08.613
I'm ready for it. Bring it on.

24:08.615 --> 24:10.215
Okay, here it comes.

24:10.217 --> 24:12.284
There it is.

24:12.286 --> 24:14.920
Narrator: Just like the movie,
they're using six mirrors,

24:14.922 --> 24:18.590
all of which are around 35 feet apart.

24:18.592 --> 24:20.292
Doink! Man, that's bright.

24:20.294 --> 24:23.529
Dude, that is, like, a two-foot laser beam.

24:23.531 --> 24:25.364
Going for mirror number four.

24:26.800 --> 24:27.867
Nice.

24:27.869 --> 24:29.135
All right. There it is.

24:29.137 --> 24:31.605
That's as good as it gets.

24:31.607 --> 24:33.340
Going for the last mirror.

24:33.342 --> 24:35.608
Okay. Coming down.

24:35.610 --> 24:36.576
Zoop!

24:36.578 --> 24:39.646
That's it. You're in.

24:39.648 --> 24:41.681
♪ Ta-da! ♪

24:41.683 --> 24:44.016
And there we go.

24:44.018 --> 24:45.851
That works pretty good.

24:45.853 --> 24:47.286
I swear, I'm gonna go out on a limb

24:47.288 --> 24:49.221
and say this room is nicely lit.

24:49.223 --> 24:52.924
I can move through the antiques
without hurting anything.

24:52.926 --> 24:54.259
Easily.

24:54.261 --> 24:56.594
Look, nobody can say that
we didn't accurately match

24:56.596 --> 24:59.231
the look and behavior of
this technique in the film.

24:59.233 --> 25:01.400
Yep. It looks just like the tomb.

25:01.402 --> 25:03.002
Narrator: It's a good start,

25:03.004 --> 25:05.838
but what does the all-important data say?

25:05.840 --> 25:07.273
All right. Let's take a reading.

25:09.110 --> 25:10.110
Okay, I got it.

25:10.112 --> 25:11.378
Well, it turns out

25:11.380 --> 25:12.914
that bigger is absolutely better.

25:12.916 --> 25:14.482
Going full-scale with our mirrors

25:14.484 --> 25:16.451
is yielding an ambient-light
reading in this room

25:16.453 --> 25:19.020
of 2.3 lux.

25:19.022 --> 25:20.455
And when you're in this room,

25:20.457 --> 25:22.491
you can totally carefully make
your way among the artifacts

25:22.493 --> 25:24.159
without any difficulty at all.

25:24.161 --> 25:26.795
By both an objective
and an empirical standard,

25:26.797 --> 25:31.199
the theory behind this
technique is totally sound.

25:31.201 --> 25:33.736
Narrator:
In fact, it's over five times brighter

25:33.738 --> 25:36.105
than the minimum level
they determined earlier,

25:36.107 --> 25:38.207
and that's very good news for the myth...

25:38.209 --> 25:40.778
except for one little thing.

25:41.580 --> 25:44.447
Jamie: Going full-scale and using
an artificial light source,

25:44.449 --> 25:46.249
we were able to very closely replicate

25:46.251 --> 25:48.018
what we saw in the movie.

25:48.020 --> 25:50.755
But this story is about using the sun.

25:53.292 --> 25:54.692
Narrator: Jamie's right,

25:54.694 --> 25:58.630
but luckily, the long-lost
sun's finally put in a show,

25:58.632 --> 26:01.332
so let there be light.

26:01.334 --> 26:03.334
The question is, will it be enough light

26:03.336 --> 26:06.970
for an archaeologist such
as me or Mr. Hyneman

26:06.972 --> 26:10.073
to be able to move through a
tomb without breaking anything?

26:10.075 --> 26:11.275
Narrator: Coming right up,

26:11.277 --> 26:14.377
it's runway runaway motor mayhem.

26:14.379 --> 26:15.945
Grant: Ohh! Yeah!

26:20.172 --> 26:24.509

out-of-control car to a stop

26:24.511 --> 26:27.344
with a dangerous game of bumper cars?

26:27.346 --> 26:28.712
- So far, so good.
- Yeah.

26:28.714 --> 26:30.881
It turns out, you <i>can</i>
slow down a coasting car

26:30.883 --> 26:32.049
using this technique.

26:32.051 --> 26:33.951
But now, I think it's time
to ramp things up.

26:33.953 --> 26:36.287
...By seeing what happens when the driver

26:36.289 --> 26:38.356
has their foot jammed on the accelerator.

26:38.358 --> 26:40.524
This is gonna be a
whole another experience,

26:40.526 --> 26:42.260
because now that the accelerator's stuck,

26:42.262 --> 26:43.661
this car's not gonna want to stop.

26:43.663 --> 26:45.596
Narrator: So, back at Alameda runway,

26:45.598 --> 26:48.200
it's pedal to the metal, literally.

26:48.202 --> 26:50.668
And for that, Tory's going green,

26:50.670 --> 26:53.839
because this time, he's doing the rescuing.

All right. Time to go save some lives.

for highway high speed.

27:00.615 --> 27:03.550
For this next test, what
I'm being asked to do

27:03.552 --> 27:06.553
is to depress the
accelerator as if it is stuck

27:06.555 --> 27:08.621
and then take my hands off the wheel.

27:08.623 --> 27:11.858
At no time should I take my
foot off the accelerator.

27:11.860 --> 27:14.493
Totally counter-intuitive
and kind of scary.

28:11.387 --> 28:13.454
- That was hairball.
- Dude!

28:13.456 --> 28:16.023
I had both feet on the brakes,

28:16.025 --> 28:17.959
and I still wasn't stopping.

We saw we were getting
closer and closer to the gate.

I'm like, "Oh, man".

28:21.398 --> 28:23.766

the hardest rescue yet,

28:29.707 --> 28:32.142
But he did pull it off.

28:32.944 --> 28:35.078
What I think we learned
from this, though,

28:35.080 --> 28:39.216
is that you <i>can</i> stop a car
even going 70 miles an hour.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.885
Unless we're gonna do this whole
thing at 100 miles an hour,

but Kari's got an appetite for more.

29:01.006 --> 29:02.773
So, this rescue myth has reminded me

29:02.775 --> 29:05.442
of a technique I've heard of
that I've always wanted to try

29:05.444 --> 29:08.144
where you actually can
sandwich a car with two cars

29:08.146 --> 29:09.412
to slow it down.

29:09.414 --> 29:11.247
Oh, so they wedge the runaway car

29:11.249 --> 29:13.216
and use friction to bring it to a stop.

29:13.218 --> 29:14.584

the squeeze on Kari's car.

29:25.531 --> 29:28.866
to stop an out-of-control
car with another car,

29:28.868 --> 29:30.834
but now we're back at the Alameda runway,

29:30.836 --> 29:33.571

about to do right here...

on Jamie and Adam's test setup...

31:43.762 --> 31:45.094
Jamie: Yeah, baby!

31:45.096 --> 31:47.263
The problem is, unlike
all their other tests,

31:47.265 --> 31:50.466
they can't just point
the sun straight inside.

I think we're set. Should
we bring in the sun?

Let's bring it in.

31:53.803 --> 31:56.470
Okay. House lights out.

Instead, they have to bounce it in,

33:01.408 --> 33:04.075
Six times brighter than
the minimum eye level,

33:04.077 --> 33:06.544
enough to put a smile on Adam's dial...

33:06.546 --> 33:07.946
well, briefly.

33:07.948 --> 33:10.081
Adam: - We're losing our beam.
- Yeah, we are.

33:10.083 --> 33:12.684
- You know what the problem is.
- What?

33:12.686 --> 33:14.319
The sun's moving.

33:14.321 --> 33:16.955
The relationships have all
changed a little bit, Jamie.

33:16.957 --> 33:18.757
- Have they?
- Yeah.

33:18.759 --> 33:20.860
The sun's moved off the primary,

33:20.862 --> 33:24.131
which means the aim on the
secondary is a little bit off.

33:24.133 --> 33:26.099
As the sun moves off the primary mirror,

33:26.101 --> 33:28.536
it kicks all the others out of kilter.

33:28.538 --> 33:29.837
And the sun's moved again.

33:29.839 --> 33:31.940
- I'm gonna kick the primary one more time.
- Okay.

33:31.942 --> 33:36.111
And for lighting up a
tomb, that <i>is</i> a problem.

33:36.113 --> 33:37.646
Jamie: The thing about using the sun

33:37.648 --> 33:39.915
is that the earth is rotating on its axis

33:39.917 --> 33:42.384
and it's also rotating around the sun,

33:42.386 --> 33:44.620
which means that from our perspective,

33:44.622 --> 33:47.523
the sun is moving all over
the place across the sky.

33:47.525 --> 33:49.191
So you can't really expect

33:49.193 --> 33:52.260
to be able to aim a beam
of light using a mirror

33:52.262 --> 33:53.795
at a specific spot

33:53.797 --> 33:55.564
without constantly adjusting it

33:55.566 --> 33:57.699
to accommodate for the sun's movement.

33:57.701 --> 34:00.268
Narrator:
And its movement is surprisingly fast.

34:00.270 --> 34:02.337
Adam:
With this much distance on these mirrors,

34:02.339 --> 34:04.139
the amount the sun's moving on the last one

34:04.141 --> 34:05.674
is like inches per minute.

34:05.676 --> 34:08.077
Well, it works, but only for
about three minutes at a time

34:08.079 --> 34:09.478
before the sun moves.

34:09.480 --> 34:12.415
The mirrors are static.
They don't move dynamically.

34:12.417 --> 34:16.253
But the sun does, and as the
sun moves through the sky,

34:16.255 --> 34:18.621
it changes its geometry
on the primary mirror,

34:18.623 --> 34:19.822
which changes the geometry

34:19.824 --> 34:21.623
on all the other mirrors in this room.

34:21.626 --> 34:23.059
They'd have to be moved dynamically

34:23.061 --> 34:25.127
throughout the whole thing
to keep this room lit.

34:25.129 --> 34:27.062
So, because of that, I don't feel like

34:27.063 --> 34:29.498
we've really seen the theory
behind this technique

34:29.500 --> 34:31.534
work as well as it could.

34:31.536 --> 34:34.570
Narrator: Yep, and that's something
that didn't happen in the movie.

34:34.572 --> 34:37.172
But before the sun sets on this myth,

34:37.174 --> 34:40.341
Jamie's got one little trick up his sleeve.

34:44.947 --> 34:48.081

and midnight oil later...

technique, we'll come in,

35:50.949 --> 35:52.782
All right.

35:52.784 --> 35:56.352
See, the other car's
bumper comes in like this.

35:56.354 --> 35:59.089
We don't have to get so far in front,

35:59.091 --> 36:01.824
so there's no chance of spinning out,

36:01.826 --> 36:04.860
and we just lock you in with a "L" shape

36:04.862 --> 36:06.228
and slow you down.

36:06.230 --> 36:08.163

36:15.638 --> 36:18.138
All you need to do is get
your car going really fast

36:18.140 --> 36:20.540
and then rear-end the car
that's out of control.

36:20.542 --> 36:24.244

harpoon the car in front of you.

you release that hook.

37:34.586 --> 37:35.952
That was beautiful!

37:35.954 --> 37:38.388
That worked so much better
than the original sandwich.

37:38.390 --> 37:41.691
Oh, my God. We totally got you.

37:41.693 --> 37:43.426
That was awesome.

37:43.428 --> 37:45.562
Grant, your method is safer.

37:45.564 --> 37:47.230
- Nice work.
- Thank you. Thanks.

37:47.232 --> 37:49.700
Now if we can only get the cars apart.

37:49.702 --> 37:52.003
Are we gonna have to
drive them home like this?

37:52.305 --> 37:55.840
I get to a constant speed,
take my hands off the wheel,

37:55.842 --> 37:59.143
and watch the cars on either side of me

37:59.145 --> 38:02.113
start to close in very, very quickly.

38:02.115 --> 38:05.684
They slam at the same time.

38:05.686 --> 38:07.653
My bumper hits the front paddles,

38:07.655 --> 38:11.124
and they actually are slowing me down.

38:11.126 --> 38:14.927
I smell rubber burning,
but I'm coming to a stop.

38:14.929 --> 38:17.029
It's amazing.

38:17.431 --> 38:19.197
Narrator:
And if that wasn't scary enough,

38:19.199 --> 38:21.166
then there's the harpoon.

38:22.367 --> 38:23.867
This is a new technique.

38:23.869 --> 38:26.603
This is more of a stabbing, hooking,

38:26.605 --> 38:28.939
and then using the weight of the vehicle

38:28.941 --> 38:31.574
to slow the out-of-control car down.

38:31.576 --> 38:35.077
This plan... nothing about
it seems like a good idea.

38:35.079 --> 38:39.582
Harpooning the back of my car,
ramming it as hard as you can...

38:39.584 --> 38:41.684
who comes up with this kind of idea?

38:41.686 --> 38:44.421
Only a crazy person.

38:44.423 --> 38:46.890
I think we're set.

38:46.892 --> 38:49.894
Narrator: It's a simple plan...
get up behind Kari's car,

38:49.896 --> 38:53.131
crash into the trunk, slam on your brakes.

38:53.133 --> 38:55.200
What could possibly go wrong?

38:55.202 --> 38:57.836
Tory: Three, two, one, go.

39:01.776 --> 39:03.076
Yeah!

39:03.078 --> 39:06.247
The runway road warrior
sets out, ready to rescue.

39:06.249 --> 39:10.819
Grant: This is Tory and Grant in
harpoon rescue, in pursuit.

39:10.821 --> 39:13.321
Okay, hands off the wheel. Go for it, man!

39:14.890 --> 39:16.791
Here we go!

39:21.296 --> 39:23.531
Narrator: Kari's car is skewered.

39:23.533 --> 39:26.433
Now, on the sophistication
scale, it's crafty.

39:26.435 --> 39:29.937
As for the all-important
results rating, it's a hit.

39:29.939 --> 39:31.271
Grant: - Is it working?
Tory: - It's working!

39:31.273 --> 39:32.606
Yeah!

39:32.608 --> 39:34.208
Kari: It's working!

39:34.210 --> 39:36.243
Can't believe it's working!

39:36.245 --> 39:37.945
Yeah!

39:37.947 --> 39:39.347
Nice!

39:39.349 --> 39:41.983
Good job!

39:41.985 --> 39:43.719
Kari: I can't believe that worked!

39:43.721 --> 39:45.087
Tory: The rear spear!

39:45.089 --> 39:46.556
Dude, that's awesome!

39:46.558 --> 39:48.124
It stopped the car out of control!

39:48.126 --> 39:50.994
Okay, we're gonna have to take both
of these ideas and patent them

39:50.996 --> 39:53.229
so that we can sell them
back to the Highway Patrol,

39:53.231 --> 39:54.430
because that's amazing.

39:54.432 --> 39:56.232
I think there are some
law-enforcement people

39:56.234 --> 39:58.167
who would be very
interested in talking to us.

39:59.870 --> 40:01.270
The harpoon technique worked.

40:01.272 --> 40:03.873
Kari took off at 50 miles an
hour. I caught up with her.

40:03.875 --> 40:06.942
It didn't take much to punch
through the back of her car

40:06.944 --> 40:08.311
and hook it.

40:08.313 --> 40:10.446
[ laughter ]

40:10.448 --> 40:12.548
I came to a stop, she came to a stop.

40:12.550 --> 40:14.718
Kari: - Yeah!
Grant: - Nice!

40:14.720 --> 40:17.187
I have to say that stopping
a car with another car

40:17.189 --> 40:19.023
has been very successful.

40:19.025 --> 40:20.858
We've gotten in front of the runaway car

40:20.860 --> 40:22.994
and applied our brakes
and safely stopped it

40:22.996 --> 40:26.131
at speeds in excess of 70 miles per hour.

40:26.133 --> 40:28.834
We've come up to the side
and sandwiched the car

40:28.836 --> 40:31.705
using plates welded to our front bumpers.

40:31.707 --> 40:36.275
And finally, we've deployed
a crazy harpoon-like spear

40:36.277 --> 40:39.312
to punch into the trunk of the runaway car

40:39.314 --> 40:40.913
and drag it to a stop.

40:40.915 --> 40:42.248
It just goes to show...

40:42.250 --> 40:45.818
if you have a runaway car,
call the MythBusters.

40:45.820 --> 40:48.488
Actually, no, you should call the police.

40:48.490 --> 40:50.357
[ tires screech ]

40:53.995 --> 40:57.130
Narrator:
Back at Tut H.Q. on Treasure Island,

40:57.132 --> 41:00.301
Jamie's not quite done testing lux levels.

41:00.303 --> 41:01.835
There's one other thing I'd like to try.

41:01.837 --> 41:04.138
- You're gonna like it.
- All right. Let's do it.

41:04.440 --> 41:06.874
In their earlier small-scale tests,

41:06.876 --> 41:10.277
Jamie made an ambient-light
level breakthrough.

41:10.279 --> 41:11.512
Jamie: The goal of all this

41:11.514 --> 41:13.881
is to raise the ambient-light
level in a room,

41:13.883 --> 41:16.651
and mirrors alone aren't gonna cut it.

41:16.653 --> 41:19.153
That light needs to hit
something that scatters it.

41:19.155 --> 41:22.423
Narrator:
So now, in their full-size, sunlit tomb,

41:22.425 --> 41:26.660
he's itching to see if this
scatter theory will scale.

41:26.662 --> 41:28.462
Turn off your head lamp and check this out.

41:31.065 --> 41:34.467
[ laughs ] That's beautiful!

41:34.469 --> 41:36.502
And you thought I didn't know
how to light up a room.

41:36.504 --> 41:39.338
I stand corrected. Let's take a reading.

41:39.940 --> 41:41.674
Okay.

41:41.676 --> 41:44.110
Maximum.

41:45.312 --> 41:47.545
All right. Moving away.

41:47.547 --> 41:51.348
Average lux... 8.62 lux!

41:51.350 --> 41:53.884
Whoo for Jamie's shirt.

41:53.886 --> 41:56.987
Amazingly, with this reflective scattering,

41:56.989 --> 41:58.522
Jamie's whiter-than-white shirt

41:58.524 --> 42:00.791
has given the maximum light reading

42:00.793 --> 42:02.292
for the entire experiment.

42:02.294 --> 42:04.127
Adam's gobsmacked.

42:04.129 --> 42:06.330
Adam: Well, it turns out that
Jamie's starched white shirt

42:06.332 --> 42:10.502
provides almost three times as
much ambient light in this space

42:10.504 --> 42:14.740
as the next best technique
of everything that we've tried.

42:14.742 --> 42:18.411
Narrator:
And Jamie's reaction? Well, this <i>is</i> Jamie.

42:18.413 --> 42:20.313
Jamie: A mirrored surface is
gonna be your best bet

42:20.315 --> 42:23.216
to get light into a room
because it's very directional.

42:23.218 --> 42:25.486
But if you want to actually light the room

42:25.488 --> 42:27.054
once that light gets in there,

42:27.056 --> 42:29.657
you're best off if it hits
a surface like my white shirt

42:29.659 --> 42:32.561
because the white isn't so directional.

42:32.563 --> 42:35.531
It's gonna spread the light and
raise your ambient-light level.

42:35.533 --> 42:38.334
How do you want to wrap this up?

42:38.936 --> 42:40.969
In theory, it's plausible,

42:40.971 --> 42:42.737
because the sun's rays did, in fact,

42:42.739 --> 42:45.306
provide enough ambient light
to move around in the room.

42:45.308 --> 42:47.742
I agree. Plausible.

42:47.744 --> 42:49.811
But totally impractical.

42:49.813 --> 42:52.514
First of all, the sun moves,
so you only get that light

42:52.516 --> 42:53.715
for about 3 1/2 minutes

42:53.717 --> 42:55.050
before you have to shift everything.

42:55.052 --> 42:56.952
And the idea that all those mirrors

42:56.954 --> 42:58.720
would sit around for 3,000 years

42:58.722 --> 43:00.689
and be ready to light up that room...

43:00.691 --> 43:02.057
totally ridiculous.

43:02.059 --> 43:03.224
Yeah.

43:03.226 --> 43:05.060
- Plausible, but ridiculous.
- Yeah.
