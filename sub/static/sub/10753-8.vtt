WEBVTT

00:07.966 --> 00:11.925
Danielle, slow down a little bit.
I can't understand you.

00:12.262 --> 00:17.211
(Woman with a French accent)
'l have a problem with my monthieur.'

00:17.600 --> 00:20.751
- With your what?
- 'My monthieur.'

00:21.062 --> 00:22.620
Your monthieur?

00:22.856 --> 00:25.290
'Oui, my monthieur, every day.'

00:25.567 --> 00:30.595
Is that your mother?
Your masseur, your Mercedes?

00:30.989 --> 00:34.106
'My monthieur! You must help me!'

00:34.409 --> 00:41.008
The best advice I can give you is
to either confront your monthieur or...

00:43.084 --> 00:46.440
...work on your self-esteem.
Thank you for your call.

00:46.755 --> 00:50.987
This is Dr Crane saying,
"Have a good evening, you deserve it."

00:53.136 --> 00:55.650
Roz, aren't you screening these calls?

00:55.930 --> 00:58.922
Yeah, but when you only have one,
you get less particular.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.725
- You look nice.
- Yeah?

01:02.979 --> 01:05.812
- I've got a date.
- Oh, great.

01:06.107 --> 01:08.575
Why are you only wearing one heel?
You break it off?

01:08.860 --> 01:11.294
No, I'm dating a sea captain
with a peg leg.

01:11.571 --> 01:13.562
It makes it easier when we dance.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.857
I broke it off in a grate.

01:17.118 --> 01:21.077
Who is this guy? Another trendy kid
who's got three earrings,

01:21.414 --> 01:23.609
a ponytail and a T-shirt under his coat?

01:23.875 --> 01:27.709
- Is he here?
- Where do you meet these people?

01:28.046 --> 01:32.358
For your information,
he is a successful media consultant.

01:32.717 --> 01:37.552
He graduated from Princeton, has a
house on Mercer Island and a sailboat.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.889
You met him on a bus, didn't you?

01:41.184 --> 01:43.300
No, we shared a cab.

01:44.521 --> 01:47.831
All right, he was driving it.

01:48.149 --> 01:50.105
- Hello.
- You remember Roz?

01:50.360 --> 01:54.558
- Yes. What brings you here?
- Oh, nothing.

01:57.075 --> 02:00.863
I was just passing by
and thought I'd stop in for a career.

02:01.204 --> 02:03.638
Good luck.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.631
The entrance to your garage is blocked

02:07.919 --> 02:10.955
by a cab driver with a ponytail
scraping gum off the seat.

02:11.256 --> 02:13.372
Madam, your chariot awaits.

02:14.759 --> 02:16.715
Better get going.

02:16.970 --> 02:21.202
Oh, actually, bad news.
The lecture's been cancelled.

02:21.558 --> 02:27.633
I wasn't relishing the idea of three hours
on right-brain-left-brain-synergy.

02:28.064 --> 02:33.092
I trimmed that speech to 2Â½ hours
and I open with a funny Al Gore joke.

02:33.486 --> 02:36.637
Let's not cry over spilt milk.
Now, we have a free evening.

02:36.948 --> 02:40.736
This is a perfect opportunity
for two guys on the loose

02:41.077 --> 02:44.387
to hit a sports bar, have a coupla
Brewskis, maybe take in a game.

02:44.706 --> 02:47.618
Right. What shall we do?

02:49.502 --> 02:51.254
- Dinner?
- Perfect.

02:51.504 --> 02:54.814
No place fancy. We don't want
a heavy meal with deserts.

02:55.133 --> 02:58.125
- Your turn to pay?
- You know me so well.

03:04.601 --> 03:07.434
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

03:07.729 --> 03:10.118
Where I parked, the sign said

03:10.398 --> 03:12.992
it was just for
customers of those stores.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.311
It's fine.

03:14.527 --> 03:18.406
I'll nip to Crabtree & Evelyn
and buy a bar of lavender soap.

03:18.740 --> 03:23.575
- You're a man! You'd look ridiculous.
- Something to drink?

03:23.953 --> 03:27.025
Fuzzy Navel blended nice and frothy.

03:27.332 --> 03:30.130
- Martini, Niles?
- No, I'm driving.

03:32.420 --> 03:35.218
- I'll buy some hand towels.
- Sit down!

03:37.759 --> 03:41.877
Unless my eyes deceive me,
that's Dad sitting over there.

03:42.222 --> 03:46.261
You're right. He said he was
going to Duke's with the boys.

03:46.601 --> 03:48.671
That certainly isn't the boys.

03:48.937 --> 03:54.250
- It must be a clandestine rendezvous.
- Sly boots. He didn't want us to know.

03:54.651 --> 03:57.404
Oh, he's looking this way. Turn around.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.403
What are they doing?

04:01.658 --> 04:04.297
It's sort of cute. He's holding her hand...

04:04.577 --> 04:07.045
Don't look!

04:07.330 --> 04:11.801
I'll tell you when you can look.
Not now. Not now.

04:13.211 --> 04:15.771
OK, now. No, not now!

04:19.134 --> 04:22.729
- Oh, I don't like this one bit.
- What are they doing?

04:23.054 --> 04:27.172
Nothing, but if Dad's eating here,
this can't be a good restaurant.

04:30.228 --> 04:35.177
- I wonder if it's their first date.
- They seem to be having a good time.

04:35.567 --> 04:40.800
- What are they doing?
- They're talking. He's smiling at her.

04:41.197 --> 04:46.510
And she's just collapsed in tears.
She's sobbing uncontrollably.

04:46.911 --> 04:49.983
Oh, yeah,
that's a Crane first date all right.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.326
She's coming this way. Hide!

04:55.086 --> 04:57.680
- You know who that is?
- She looked familiar.

04:57.964 --> 05:03.118
- That was Marion Lawlor.
- I last heard that name as a kid.

05:03.511 --> 05:06.105
Mom and Dad fell out with the Lawlors.

05:06.389 --> 05:09.062
They did, when we shared a cabin.

05:09.351 --> 05:11.740
Maybe Dad's just patching things up.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.409
Doing his usual bang-up job.

05:16.066 --> 05:18.534
This is awkward. Let's get out of here.

05:18.818 --> 05:21.537
No, if we leave now, he'll spot us.

05:21.821 --> 05:26.178
- Maybe you should have that Martini.
- I can't, I'm driving.

05:26.534 --> 05:29.606
Not any more.
They just towed your car.

05:33.375 --> 05:35.969
(Growling and yapping)

05:41.049 --> 05:45.440
You little hooligan, get off that couch!
You're not supposed to do that.

05:45.804 --> 05:50.082
If Dr Crane sees you,
he'll throw both of us off the balcony!

05:50.433 --> 05:53.311
Good boy. Now, you stay there.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.961
(Growls and yaps)

06:00.000 --> 06:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:07.575 --> 06:11.648
Eddie... Glad to see my rules
about the couch are taking hold.

06:16.751 --> 06:18.707
Good dog.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.427
Dad, Daphne!

06:22.674 --> 06:25.063
- Hello, Dr Crane.
- Hello. Where's Dad?

06:25.343 --> 06:28.335
Mr Dorsey invited him over
to watch the ballgame.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.947
Great,
he's getting to know the neighbours.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.455
What?

06:34.686 --> 06:38.122
- Why don't you grow a moustache?
- It wouldn't suit me.

06:38.440 --> 06:41.955
- Oh, yes, it does.
- You've never seen me with one.

06:42.277 --> 06:46.509
I have. There's a billboard
for your show down on 16th Street.

06:46.865 --> 06:50.062
- Some kids spray painted you.
- It looked good?

06:50.368 --> 06:53.246
Oh, yes. But a word to the wise.

06:53.538 --> 06:57.247
Take care of your teeth -
that look is not flattering on you.

06:59.669 --> 07:00.624
(Doorbell)

07:00.837 --> 07:02.270
I'll get it.

07:04.716 --> 07:05.910
Hello, Dr Crane.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.204
- Hello.
- What brings you here?

07:08.470 --> 07:10.904
A Rent-a-car, thanks to my brother.

07:11.848 --> 07:14.316
- I assume you're here for a reason.
- Yes.

07:14.601 --> 07:20.631
Frasier, last night when I got home,
that incident with Dad and Mrs Lawlor

07:21.066 --> 07:24.581
made me think what caused
the rift between our families.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.292
So I dug out my old boyhood journal

07:27.572 --> 07:32.692
and looked up my entries from our
last summer together at the lake.

07:33.078 --> 07:36.468
According to this,
there was a three-week period

07:36.790 --> 07:40.180
where Mom and Dad
had screaming matches every night.

07:40.502 --> 07:42.697
- I don't recall that.
- That's right.

07:42.962 --> 07:46.875
That was when you wore the wax
earplugs and the slumber mask.

07:48.343 --> 07:52.302
You were looking at the
"National Geographic" with a flashlight.

07:52.639 --> 07:56.348
- I was looking at the maps.
- That's what makes it scary.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.391
What was your point?

08:02.649 --> 08:04.605
Something more
provocative happened

08:04.859 --> 08:07.976
during that same period. Here.

08:08.279 --> 08:09.632
Read this.

08:10.907 --> 08:14.866
"Though summer at the lake seems
but a vapid, vacuous experience,

08:15.203 --> 08:19.754
"it is a tonic for my troubled youth."
How old were you when you wrote this?

08:20.125 --> 08:22.161
Almost nine.

08:24.004 --> 08:27.474
Which explains the redundancy
"vapid" and "vacuous".

08:27.799 --> 08:30.267
By ten, my writing had gotten tighter.

08:30.552 --> 08:33.589
Among other things.

08:33.888 --> 08:37.323
The point is that
I crept out onto the screen porch,

08:37.642 --> 08:41.919
leaving the lights off
so as not to attract bats and moths.

08:42.272 --> 08:44.991
As I peered out through the darkness,

08:45.275 --> 08:49.348
between the trees I saw Dad
and Mrs Lawlor in each other's arms.

08:49.696 --> 08:53.086
It's clear what happened.
Dad and Mrs Lawlor had an affair.

08:53.408 --> 08:57.162
I appreciate your attempt
to spice up our family history,

08:57.495 --> 09:00.214
but we're not a Jackie Collins novel.
It's ridiculous.

09:00.498 --> 09:03.535
Is it?
All right, allow me to present exhibit "B".

09:03.835 --> 09:07.350
This is a photo album
Mom prepared of the same period.

09:07.672 --> 09:10.664
I love to see old family photos.

09:10.967 --> 09:15.245
My goodness, what a handsome,
sinewy young bloke!

09:15.597 --> 09:17.076
That was Dad.

09:17.307 --> 09:19.502
You two take after your mother,
don't you?

09:20.810 --> 09:22.846
All right. Look at this.

09:23.104 --> 09:26.221
That's Dad, but the person
next to him has been cut out.

09:26.524 --> 09:31.757
And here, you can still see the edges
of a dress and a handbag and sandals.

09:32.155 --> 09:34.669
Who's that scrawny chap

09:34.949 --> 09:37.383
with the fish-belly complexion
and rain hat?

09:37.660 --> 09:41.733
I was under doctor's orders
to stay out of direct sunlight.

09:43.291 --> 09:48.968
We don't know that was Mrs Lawlor.
It wouldn't prove they had an affair.

09:49.381 --> 09:53.294
- What?
- Niles thinks Dad had an illicit affair.

09:53.635 --> 09:57.389
- Your father? He's not the type.
- That's what I think.

09:57.722 --> 10:00.520
- And there's not enough proof.
- Is it impossible?

10:00.809 --> 10:04.518
- Anything is possible.
- Why don't you ask him?

10:04.854 --> 10:09.882
Right. "Father, did you boff a neighbour
while we were roasting marshmallows?"

10:13.697 --> 10:16.370
Ah. There's one sure way
to get the truth.

10:16.658 --> 10:19.172
- We'll call Aunt Vivienne.
- Who's that?

10:19.452 --> 10:22.250
Better known as the Mouth.

10:22.539 --> 10:26.248
- We are not calling her.
- You afraid of finding out something?

10:26.584 --> 10:30.372
Yes, that she knows where I live
and she still drives.

10:30.714 --> 10:34.389
You two are worse
than gossipy washerwomen.

10:34.718 --> 10:37.755
The way to solve this
is to ask your father.

10:38.054 --> 10:41.171
Ask me what?

10:41.474 --> 10:45.831
Your sons have some cockeyed notion
that you had an affair 30 years ago.

10:46.187 --> 10:48.178
What?

10:53.028 --> 10:58.739
- Where did that idea come from?
- Frasier saw you with Marion Lawlor.

10:59.159 --> 11:02.390
- You were with me!
- You were spying on me?

11:02.704 --> 11:07.858
No, we were just having dinner
when you were "with your buddies".

11:08.251 --> 11:10.526
That proves I had an affair?

11:10.795 --> 11:16.870
No, but Niles remembered this time
when he saw you and her hugging.

11:17.302 --> 11:20.260
It was the time
when you and Mom were fighting a lot.

11:20.555 --> 11:24.025
- Then you stopped seeing the Lawlors.
- This is stupid!

11:24.351 --> 11:29.345
Right. They were even going to
give some Aunt Vivienne a call.

11:31.149 --> 11:35.188
Daphne, would you give me a minute
alone with these two?

11:35.528 --> 11:36.847
I understand.

11:37.072 --> 11:41.111
Send the help to the room.
I never get to hear any good stuff.

11:45.163 --> 11:50.874
Don't bother calling Aunt Vivienne.
You want to know the truth? Fine.

11:52.003 --> 11:54.471
I had an affair.

11:54.756 --> 11:58.226
It happened long ago
and it's not anything I'm proud of.

11:58.551 --> 12:02.305
Now that I've answered everything,
do me a favour.

12:02.639 --> 12:05.597
This is never to be
brought up again, understand?

12:05.892 --> 12:08.008
End of discussion.

12:13.608 --> 12:15.166
Well...

12:16.194 --> 12:18.469
It's times like this that most families...

12:19.781 --> 12:22.818
...pull together and draw strength
from each other.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.272
What shall we do?

12:34.796 --> 12:37.549
Thank you.

12:37.841 --> 12:41.311
I came to see how you are,
but I only have a few minutes.

12:41.636 --> 12:45.311
I start my "healing with humour"
support group tonight and...

12:45.640 --> 12:47.676
I must pick up my big shoes.

12:47.934 --> 12:52.644
How am I doing?
How are you doing, Niles?

12:53.023 --> 12:56.299
Doesn't it bother you
that your father cheated on my mother?

12:59.070 --> 13:01.265
Your loyalties are seeping through.

13:01.531 --> 13:05.444
Besides, I got Mom's small features
while you got Dad's chunky thighs.

13:07.537 --> 13:10.210
It must have caused Mom a lot of pain.

13:10.498 --> 13:15.208
Agreed, but they went on
and had a very happy life together.

13:15.587 --> 13:18.340
They got over it. Why can't you?

13:18.631 --> 13:20.622
Rationally,
I should be able to handle this.

13:20.884 --> 13:23.796
I deal with human frailty every day.

13:25.055 --> 13:30.413
But in this case, it's not people -
one of our parents had an affair.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.040
How could Dad cheat with Marion

13:33.313 --> 13:36.783
knowing the effect
it would have on Mom and us?

13:37.108 --> 13:40.384
Why don't you just
pull up a chair and join us?

13:41.863 --> 13:46.539
I just can't believe
that it's...it's our father.

13:47.994 --> 13:50.827
I never had a great relationship
with him,

13:51.122 --> 13:54.478
but I always respected his integrity.

13:54.793 --> 13:57.944
Just thinking about
what he did sickens me.

13:58.254 --> 14:02.930
As your brother, as a therapist,
I think you have to let this go.

14:03.301 --> 14:07.010
You should come to my
"healing with humour" support group.

14:08.306 --> 14:10.774
Thank you, but I need a night to myself.

14:11.059 --> 14:14.449
If you change your mind,
it should be a hoot.

14:14.771 --> 14:17.763
As we speak,
I'm wearing oversized polka-dot boxers

14:18.066 --> 14:20.421
and quick-release suspenders.

14:26.157 --> 14:28.512
(Growling and yapping)

14:35.875 --> 14:40.187
I see all sorts of things have been
going on behind my back! Get...!

14:40.547 --> 14:42.185
(Doorbell)

14:48.138 --> 14:50.698
- Frasier?
- Yes.

14:50.974 --> 14:55.206
You may not remember me.
Marion Lawlor.

14:55.562 --> 14:59.601
- Yes, I remember you.
- Is your Dad home?

14:59.941 --> 15:04.969
No, but if you come back later,
you can have the place to yourselves.

15:05.363 --> 15:08.639
No, that's not necessary.
We had dinner the other night,

15:08.950 --> 15:11.748
and I left rather abruptly.

15:12.037 --> 15:16.189
I wanted to tell him I'm sorry.
Would you please give him my best?

15:16.541 --> 15:19.897
I think you've already done that.

15:20.211 --> 15:23.044
Is this a bad time? You seem upset.

15:23.340 --> 15:25.934
Would you come in for a moment?

15:29.179 --> 15:31.647
After you met with Dad the other night,

15:31.931 --> 15:36.721
he and I talked, and I learned
what happened that summer.

15:37.103 --> 15:39.856
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:40.148 --> 15:45.461
I'm not the kind of person who can hear
news like that and just forget about it.

15:46.738 --> 15:48.694
I know you're upset.

15:48.948 --> 15:52.907
But if it's any consolation,
in time, your father and I forgave them.

15:53.244 --> 15:54.882
Forgave them?

15:55.121 --> 15:59.000
Your mother was a good person.

15:59.334 --> 16:03.293
So was my husband.
They made a mistake.

16:04.923 --> 16:10.680
Anyway, tell your father I stopped by.
I felt so silly crying the other night.

16:11.096 --> 16:15.726
I've been a little overemotional
since Dan died.

16:16.101 --> 16:18.535
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.

16:18.812 --> 16:22.521
You never realise
how hard that's going to hit you.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.053
Look who I'm telling this to!

16:26.319 --> 16:30.551
The famous radio psychiatrist
Dr Frasier Crane!

16:30.907 --> 16:37.096
I remember you when you ran around
in your undies with your pail and shovel.

16:38.832 --> 16:42.871
Yes, well, I rarely
get to the shore any more.

16:43.211 --> 16:46.169
Well, goodbye, Frasier.

16:46.464 --> 16:48.182
Goodbye.

16:57.142 --> 17:00.976
Working on the docks has always
been a tradition for us Moons.

17:01.312 --> 17:05.430
Me father worked on the docks,
me grandfather. All me brothers do.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.925
Well, except for Billy.

17:08.194 --> 17:11.231
He came home one day,
saying he hated the smell of fish.

17:11.531 --> 17:14.284
He was going to teach
ballroom dancing.

17:14.576 --> 17:18.012
And he did. And he does.

17:18.329 --> 17:22.960
He's me mum's favourite. Dad flicks
the crust off his kidney pie at him.

17:23.335 --> 17:25.929
How much longer do I have to do this?

17:26.212 --> 17:31.411
Be patient. You don't want to drag
your leg behind you like a dead branch.

17:31.801 --> 17:35.237
I'm talking about
listening to your family's history.

17:35.555 --> 17:40.993
Why would a man of your intelligence
say a thing like that

17:41.394 --> 17:45.672
when you're in the position you're in,
and I'm in the position I'm in?

17:46.024 --> 17:47.503
All right.

17:48.485 --> 17:50.715
(Daphne) 'Up you come.'

17:55.033 --> 17:59.549
That's much better.
I'll go run your bath.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.141
Hi, Dad. You look kinda tired.

18:08.421 --> 18:11.413
I just finished
my exercises with Nurse Ratchet.

18:13.677 --> 18:17.590
- Do you have to watch TV right now?
- Yeah, my programme's on.

18:17.931 --> 18:22.527
If either of us could work the VCR,
we'd tape it, but...

18:22.894 --> 18:25.533
There's something I'd like to talk about.

18:25.814 --> 18:29.363
Oh, for God's sake.
I've told you everything I'm going to.

18:29.693 --> 18:31.649
Now drop it.

18:31.903 --> 18:34.019
(Rattling and thumping)

18:37.409 --> 18:39.206
Dad...

18:39.452 --> 18:42.171
- Why didn't you tell me the truth?
- I did.

18:42.455 --> 18:47.973
Marion Lawlor came by today
to apologise for the other night.

18:48.378 --> 18:52.530
While she was here,
she told me what really happened.

18:53.675 --> 18:57.224
So now you know.
You stuck your nose

18:57.554 --> 18:59.545
where it didn't belong.
Are you happy now?

18:59.806 --> 19:03.799
- Why didn't you tell me it was Mom?
- Cos it's none of your business!

19:04.144 --> 19:08.103
I understand you being defensive,
but I had a right to know.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.795
This happens to a lot of people.

19:11.067 --> 19:14.855
If it's any consolation,
I know exactly how you feel.

19:15.196 --> 19:19.474
I never told you this,
but Lilith did the same thing to me.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.817
Lilith had an affair?

19:22.078 --> 19:25.832
It was the most humiliating
experience of my life.

19:26.166 --> 19:29.602
I'm sure you felt the same way.

19:29.919 --> 19:34.947
I hadn't thought about it for some time,
but thanks for reminding me.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.412
Lilith?

19:38.094 --> 19:42.963
I found her attractive!
Is it strange another man might, too?

19:44.184 --> 19:46.300
I guess.

19:47.812 --> 19:50.406
- Who was the bozo in your case?
- Oh, God.

19:50.690 --> 19:56.208
A Frenchman who lived in
a self-contained underground ecopod.

19:56.613 --> 20:01.164
That still sounds better
than a urologist with a bad comb-over.

20:04.454 --> 20:05.728
I'm sorry.

20:07.540 --> 20:12.056
Look, do me a favour.
Don't hate your mother for this.

20:15.340 --> 20:20.778
I wasn't easy to live with, and she had
plenty of reason for doing what she did.

20:21.179 --> 20:24.694
Luckily, we were able to
put it behind us, but I'll tell you...

20:26.059 --> 20:28.129
...at times it tore me up.

20:31.606 --> 20:34.678
I loved your mother.

20:34.984 --> 20:36.895
So did I.

20:38.405 --> 20:43.684
I know, son. That's why I said
I was the one who had the affair.

20:44.077 --> 20:47.433
I was just trying to protect her.

20:47.747 --> 20:51.535
Me, you already had problems with.

20:51.876 --> 20:56.188
I appreciate what you did,
but you should have told me.

20:56.548 --> 21:01.576
Listen. When Frederick grows up,
will you tell him what Lilith did to you?

21:06.808 --> 21:08.241
OK.

21:08.476 --> 21:11.070
- Can I watch my programme now?
- One second.

21:11.354 --> 21:14.471
I gotta clear one thing up.
There's this photo album.

21:14.774 --> 21:19.609
There's all these pictures
with the same woman cut out of them.

21:19.988 --> 21:23.867
What else do you notice, Sherlock?
Like, where's your mother?

21:25.452 --> 21:28.330
- Oh, that was Mom!
- Yes.

21:28.621 --> 21:32.011
She cut herself out of it.
She'd put a few pounds on.

21:32.334 --> 21:35.053
She wore a brown dress with a belt.

21:35.337 --> 21:39.933
Aunt Vivienne said she looked
like a knackwurst tied in the middle.

21:40.300 --> 21:45.294
We've been trying
to find something we have in common.

21:45.680 --> 21:49.229
- I think we finally found it.
- Yeah.

21:49.559 --> 21:52.631
- Wish it was a birthmark.
- So do I.

22:05.283 --> 22:10.152
# Baby, I hear the blues a-calling
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:10.538 --> 22:12.130
# Mercy!

22:12.374 --> 22:18.131
# Maybe I seem a bit confused
Yeah maybe, but I got you pegged!

22:19.506 --> 22:23.215
# But I don't know what to do
With those salads and scrambled eggs

22:26.429 --> 22:28.738
# They're calling again

22:29.265 --> 22:31.654
# Scrambled eggs all over my face

22:31.935 --> 22:35.450
# What is a boy to do?

22:36.064 --> 22:37.213
# Thank you! #
