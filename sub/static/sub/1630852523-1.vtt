00:11.553 --> 00:14.639
why can't people who hit millions
of other people

00:14.723 --> 00:17.308
be as famous as A-list celebrities?

00:19.519 --> 00:22.147
I think I have around
12 million followers now.

00:22.230 --> 00:25.191
-Between 16 to 17 million.
-Thirty million followers.

00:25.275 --> 00:26.943
It hopped to a million so fast.

00:27.444 --> 00:30.405
A million people know who you are.
It's just weird.

00:32.073 --> 00:33.950
Like, I don't know how this is my life.

00:34.034 --> 00:37.412
I don't know how this many people
follow me, or just care about me.

00:37.495 --> 00:38.872
Do I think I'm famous?

00:38.955 --> 00:41.041
I think I have a sprinkle of fame.

00:41.124 --> 00:44.544
So you just woke up one day
and became an Internet celebrity?

00:45.295 --> 00:47.589
Honestly? Kinda.

00:49.132 --> 00:53.094
It's so impactful. TikTok decides
what's cool and what's not cool.

00:53.178 --> 00:54.012
Who's famous.

00:54.095 --> 00:57.265
Feels like a dream.
We just posted a video on an app.

00:57.348 --> 00:59.059
Now I'm living in a mansion.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.520
Year and a half ago,
we moved into a house

01:02.604 --> 01:04.355
full of friends to make content.

01:04.439 --> 01:07.442
Started getting interviewed
by <i>Forbes, The New York Times</i>.

01:07.525 --> 01:09.069
Now we're the Hype House.

01:09.152 --> 01:11.946
Your power
is associated with likes,

01:12.030 --> 01:13.907
your following, and your relationship.

01:13.990 --> 01:17.035
People really, really like you,
or people really, really hate you.

01:17.118 --> 01:20.705
And one wrong move
can make everything crumble.

01:20.789 --> 01:21.831
In a second. In a second.

01:22.415 --> 01:24.584
My biggest fear is not getting canceled

01:24.667 --> 01:26.836
it's getting canceled
for something I didn't do.

01:30.465 --> 01:34.177
We have ten 20-year-olds
living in a $5 million house together

01:34.260 --> 01:35.720
filming content all day.

01:35.804 --> 01:37.097
Just it doesn't sound real.

01:37.180 --> 01:42.060
Imagine a fraternity filled
with people who have millions of followers

01:42.143 --> 01:45.980
and dollars at their fingertips
with high school drama and like…

01:47.273 --> 01:48.525
a ring light.

01:51.486 --> 01:53.696


01:53.780 --> 01:55.448


01:55.532 --> 01:58.493


01:58.576 --> 02:00.453
He's gonna stay in the robe and wait

02:00.537 --> 02:02.497
then I'm gonna grab and bring Vinnie down.

02:02.580 --> 02:05.792
The minute Vinnie walks into frame,
he's gotta be like…

02:05.875 --> 02:09.295
Are you insane?
No, he would not love that…

02:10.713 --> 02:11.881
-Vinnie?
-Yeah?

02:11.965 --> 02:13.925
-I need to show you something.
-Jesus.

02:14.008 --> 02:15.510


02:15.593 --> 02:16.970
-You'll look good.
-What?

02:17.053 --> 02:17.887
Okay.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.014
So, Vinnie, remember that one time

02:20.098 --> 02:23.351
you joked about saying
you wanted to wrestle a sumo wrestler?

02:23.434 --> 02:24.269
Yeah?

02:24.352 --> 02:26.855
Yeah!

02:26.938 --> 02:29.190
Oh Jesus. Oh God.

02:29.691 --> 02:32.610
-Oh my God. He's giant!
-I don't know.

02:33.194 --> 02:35.405
-This was your idea.
-I was joking!

02:38.158 --> 02:40.368
Hype House is like
a social media collective

02:40.451 --> 02:42.704
that is also kind of like an incubator.

02:42.787 --> 02:45.832
Since you guys haven't met
everyone yet, here's the squad.

02:45.915 --> 02:49.252
We've launched Charli,
and Dixie, and Addison.

02:49.335 --> 02:51.629
Being a part of this brand
helped blow everyone up.

02:52.463 --> 02:54.841
So I'm gonna get my ass beat
for the camera.

02:54.924 --> 02:56.634
-You got this. Good champ.
-Easily.

02:56.718 --> 02:59.304
-I'm gonna get thrown the out.
-Yes, you will.

02:59.387 --> 03:01.389
-Hi.

03:06.853 --> 03:10.106
My role in the Hype House is
kind of like the dad of the house

03:10.190 --> 03:12.984
I would say like "the manager"
but I don't take a percentage.

03:14.944 --> 03:17.780
I grew up quick,
and I never really had a childhood.

03:17.864 --> 03:21.951
I never had one place to call my home
and that's what I do here.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.662
-Come on, Thomas!
-He's almost there! Let's go!

03:25.788 --> 03:26.748
Oh my God!

03:26.831 --> 03:28.208
Get him!

03:28.291 --> 03:29.459
Let's go, Thomas!

03:29.542 --> 03:33.213
Hype House is something that I started
and put my heart and soul into

03:33.296 --> 03:35.548
so it's, in some ways,
an extension of myself

03:35.632 --> 03:38.718
and I don't want something
I've worked hard for to fade away.

03:39.844 --> 03:41.596
-Vinnie, mindset.
-Come on.

03:41.679 --> 03:42.972
You got this, Vinnie.

03:43.556 --> 03:44.474
Come on.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.851
-One, two, three!

03:46.935 --> 03:49.729
Push him! Push, dude! Push, Vinnie!

03:49.812 --> 03:50.897
Come on, Vinnie!

03:50.980 --> 03:54.192
Bringing in new people is critical
to why this house works

03:54.275 --> 03:56.027
and the only way to keep it long-term.

03:56.110 --> 03:58.863
Stay planted!

03:58.947 --> 04:00.615


04:00.698 --> 04:02.575
Vinnie's the newest member
of the house.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.744
He's a fresh face. He's the new talent.

04:04.827 --> 04:07.413
And it's really important
to bring in people like that

04:07.497 --> 04:09.415
especially as people move on.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.167
-Yeah!

04:11.918 --> 04:13.461
-It was fun, actually.
-Yeah?

04:13.544 --> 04:15.129
-I learned a lot.
-What?

04:15.213 --> 04:17.674
That I can't beat
a 600-pound man in sumo wrestling.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.842

That's a good thing to learn.

04:24.973 --> 04:29.477


04:35.858 --> 04:37.568
Thank you. Thank you.

04:46.244 --> 04:47.996
Mouthwash.

04:48.496 --> 04:49.706
Oh… I wanna do it.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.874
-Scene one, take one.

04:54.002 --> 04:56.879
How fast did the rise
come for you on TikTok?

04:56.963 --> 05:00.758
It actually took me a while,
because it was hard when I was not in L.A.

05:00.842 --> 05:02.093


05:02.176 --> 05:04.554
Growing up in Stockton,
I was trapped in a bubble.

05:04.637 --> 05:06.931
No one to collaborate with,
I made videos by myself.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.891
What's up? I'm live again.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.269
Just posted my profile picture,
and I'll see you there.

05:11.352 --> 05:13.980
School was stressful for me.
I didn't really fit in.

05:14.063 --> 05:16.774
I got made fun of for doing social media,
for the way I dressed.

05:16.858 --> 05:19.694
My parents noticed school was taking
a toll on my mental health

05:19.777 --> 05:23.114
and so I switched
from a public school to online school,

05:23.197 --> 05:26.784
just because I wanted to take
my Internet stuff more seriously.

05:28.202 --> 05:30.580
Then I started to grow
my Internet popularity

05:30.663 --> 05:33.499
through social media and TikTok

05:33.583 --> 05:37.462
and like, just hanging out
and meeting people, I guess.

05:37.545 --> 05:41.132
And that's where
the love for meeting people

05:41.215 --> 05:44.510
and having that deep connection
with your friends started, I guess.

05:44.594 --> 05:47.180
-No.

05:47.263 --> 05:49.223
I was about to win
big time there for a sec.

05:51.893 --> 05:55.438
-Dude, I haven't seen Chase in forever.
-I haven't seen him since the last house.

06:02.987 --> 06:04.322
Big bonus!

06:04.405 --> 06:07.367
-Hey! Can you open the door?

06:08.993 --> 06:11.120
-Mother… boys!
-Hey!

06:11.204 --> 06:12.830
Oh!

06:12.914 --> 06:14.540
Oh my God.

06:14.624 --> 06:15.958
-Vinnie!
-It's been a minute.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.585
-Come on.
-How are you doing?

06:17.668 --> 06:20.088
Good to see you.
Let me show you guys around.

06:20.171 --> 06:21.214
Welcome to my humble home.

06:23.549 --> 06:25.593
Oh, I knew you'd have
a foosball table.

06:25.676 --> 06:27.011
-I got two.
-Two?

06:27.095 --> 06:30.181
Chase's house is so sick. I love it.

06:30.264 --> 06:32.683
-Do you have a throne yet?
-A throne?

06:32.767 --> 06:35.520
Low-key looks like
Cheesecake Factory.

06:35.603 --> 06:39.690
I love Cheesecake Factory,
so right as I stepped in the house,

06:39.774 --> 06:42.318
I was like. "Where is it?
I need the bread and butter."

06:42.402 --> 06:44.695
Bro, this is sick.
You're living the life here.

06:44.779 --> 06:46.489
-I'm proud of you.
-Thank you.

06:46.572 --> 06:49.951
-Your music's doing so well.
-It's so good, Chase.

06:50.493 --> 06:54.664
I'm very grateful for the opportunities
that came to me through,

06:54.747 --> 06:57.458
um, being a social media star.

06:57.542 --> 07:01.796
But it could end at any single point
and music's my passion.

07:01.879 --> 07:05.883
I see people making videos,
like, "I hate that the song is good."

07:05.967 --> 07:09.220
I know! I'm like,
"Should I be offended by this?"

07:09.804 --> 07:11.097
It took me such a long time,

07:11.180 --> 07:14.350
but I just recently signed
to Interscope Records

07:14.434 --> 07:16.310
and I'm working on my first album,

07:16.394 --> 07:19.522
and now I'm starting to take my life
in a different direction.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.400
-You wanna show us around more?
-I do.

07:22.483 --> 07:24.444
-But this is my chill area.
-Sick.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.154
Which leads to the backyard.

07:28.364 --> 07:30.575
-Whoa-ho-ho!
-Do these shoot water?

07:30.658 --> 07:31.868
Yeah. You want them on?

07:31.951 --> 07:34.036
-Shoot the water right now.
-No.

07:36.414 --> 07:38.458
There's a bridge.
You can dive off it.

07:38.541 --> 07:39.834
-Serious?
-Yeah.

07:39.917 --> 07:41.252
This is our basketball court.

07:41.335 --> 07:42.503
Oh-ho!

07:42.587 --> 07:43.463
Yeah.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.298
-Oh!
-Hey!

07:45.381 --> 07:47.967
It's called being well-rounded.
Now, I got my room.

07:48.050 --> 07:50.052
-Whoa, dude.
-Just right inside, huh?

07:54.932 --> 07:57.268
-Wow.
-This is my bed. It's fire.

07:57.351 --> 07:59.520
It can lift. It can massage.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.481
What the hell? This is fire.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.191
-Wait.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.569
Is that comfy like that?

08:06.652 --> 08:08.988
-It's so comfy.

08:09.071 --> 08:10.156
I miss you.

08:10.239 --> 08:11.908
You need to come
to the house more.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.117
Yeah.

08:13.701 --> 08:19.540
It sucks I haven't been able to go to you,
and now I'm finishing up the album.

08:19.624 --> 08:23.377
It's been quite a hard time and I'm sorry
I haven't been able to come out to y'all.

08:23.461 --> 08:26.464
What did it feel like moving out, though?

08:26.547 --> 08:29.550
It was super stressful.
Like, getting this place was hard.

08:29.634 --> 08:33.137
-Yeah.
-I've been in my own little world.

08:33.221 --> 08:37.725
And all of those people
were basically my family.

08:37.808 --> 08:41.771
Thomas was definitely
a person that I hung out with

08:41.854 --> 08:44.690
and went to with my problems every day.

08:44.774 --> 08:48.653
I used to live in Hype House,
and me and Thomas were like this.

08:48.736 --> 08:49.987
We were for-lifers.

08:50.071 --> 08:54.742
The one thing I was most scared of doing
was actually getting my own place

08:54.825 --> 08:57.703
and losing my relationship with Thomas.

08:57.787 --> 09:00.331
I do miss… I do miss Tommy Boy.

09:01.415 --> 09:03.167
I've overheard people

09:03.251 --> 09:06.170
they were like, mad or whatever,
disappointed that,

09:06.837 --> 09:08.339
like, you just moved out.

09:08.422 --> 09:10.341
-Yeah.
-But, you know,

09:10.424 --> 09:13.594
it's not going to say
that they dislike you or anything.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.805
-Hmm.
-'Cause if anything, the reason

09:15.888 --> 09:18.683
that they were mad for you moving out
was 'cause they like you.

09:18.766 --> 09:21.227
'Cause they love you.
You know, they miss you.

09:30.695 --> 09:31.696
Oh, pizza?

09:31.779 --> 09:34.907
There's cheese,
pepperoni, barbecue chicken.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.869
One thing that makes
this house so special is we all come from

09:38.953 --> 09:40.496
our own unique places.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.416
Some might've not fit in in school,
and people might've bullied them.

09:43.499 --> 09:48.170
A lot of the other people, like myself,
have come from difficult home lives.

09:48.254 --> 09:52.049
That's where we all found each other
and that's why we're so close.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.551
-Ooh!

09:53.634 --> 09:55.052
Can you hand me that cheese?

09:55.970 --> 09:57.555
Wait, so are we having a party?

09:57.638 --> 09:58.764
-Thomas?
-Yes?

09:58.848 --> 10:01.767
Pool party. When,
and how many people can we have?

10:01.851 --> 10:03.769
Whoever you would like over.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.647
Can we, like, come up
with people that we would want there?

10:06.731 --> 10:08.524
-Nikita.
-Larray.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.776
Do we want to invite Ryland and Chase?

10:13.446 --> 10:14.488
-Yes.
-No.

10:14.572 --> 10:15.740
-Yes.
-Nah.

10:15.823 --> 10:17.325
When we moved houses,

10:17.408 --> 10:20.077
they said they'd be over all the time,
in particular Chase.

10:20.786 --> 10:23.414
At the last house we had,
we all lived together

10:23.497 --> 10:27.126
but Chase moved into another house
because he was doing music in the city

10:27.209 --> 10:30.254
and he didn't wanna drive
an hour every day to get back.

10:30.338 --> 10:33.841
We wanna keep Chase's house
as an extension of Hype House,

10:33.924 --> 10:35.968
so it's more of
a Hype House L.A. location.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.804
They're gonna work on making content
out of there for Hype House.

10:38.888 --> 10:39.722
We will.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.724
The rent here is paid for

10:41.807 --> 10:44.477
by brand deals we do
on the Hype House socials.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.188
So everyone's kind of expected
to help out with that

10:47.271 --> 10:48.981
so we can have money
to pay for everything.

10:49.065 --> 10:51.817
When Chase moved out,
I still put the offer out there.

10:51.901 --> 10:54.278
"If you do content,
your house will get paid for."

10:54.362 --> 10:56.364
"We can do Hype House 2. It'll be great."

10:56.447 --> 10:58.532
But Chase hasn't posted anything recently.

10:58.616 --> 11:01.202
He made one TikTok
over the last six months.

11:01.285 --> 11:03.287
I've already texted him five times
about us doing

11:03.371 --> 11:05.414
Hype House photo shoots, stuff like that.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.292
Absolutely no response,
but we should invite Chase.

11:08.376 --> 11:10.378
Why even give him the opportunity? I--

11:10.461 --> 11:13.422
-To be the better person--
-being the better person.

11:13.506 --> 11:17.385
Well, that's why I'm good at being
the better person, Michael.

11:17.468 --> 11:19.387
There are always diehards for Chase

11:19.470 --> 11:22.014
that will no longer support the Hype House
if he's not in it.

11:22.098 --> 11:23.683
I think it would damage the brand,

11:23.766 --> 11:26.519
so I need to know
if Chase is gonna be a part of this.

11:32.108 --> 11:33.984
Can you let me eat my pizza?

11:34.068 --> 11:35.444
Holy…

11:41.242 --> 11:44.870


11:44.954 --> 11:47.623


11:51.377 --> 11:53.170
Good morning!

11:53.254 --> 11:56.632
-Good morning, Miss Dragun.
-I have an Apple Music interview.

11:56.716 --> 12:00.803
That's so exciting.
So this glam needs to be extra sickening.

12:00.886 --> 12:01.721
Extra sickening.

12:01.804 --> 12:05.182
I just really need something that says…

12:05.266 --> 12:07.226
-Rich.
-Yeah.

12:07.935 --> 12:10.146
I'm the dragon they keep
in Hype House's dungeon.

12:10.229 --> 12:12.356
-
-Nikita shows up with the power!

12:12.440 --> 12:13.274


12:13.357 --> 12:15.568
I bring the flavor
to the Hype House.

12:15.651 --> 12:17.278
I bring the fire, the fashions.

12:17.361 --> 12:20.072
And the smelling good,
'cause a lot of them don't wear deodorant,

12:20.156 --> 12:22.074
and they need to. They really do.

12:29.457 --> 12:32.334
I started my makeup line
out of frustration.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.254
I was so fed up with the fact

12:35.337 --> 12:40.551
that I didn't have anyone
in the makeup world that was like me.

12:40.634 --> 12:42.178


12:42.762 --> 12:46.223
There were products
that were meant for so many other people

12:46.307 --> 12:49.101
but for me, as a trans woman,
they weren't made for me.

12:49.185 --> 12:52.104
I was at home
mixing red lipsticks together

12:52.188 --> 12:54.940
in order to get
the perfect shade of color corrector

12:55.024 --> 12:57.943
so that I could cover my beard
and my five o'clock shadow.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.696
And I felt like there were
other trans people out there

13:00.780 --> 13:03.324
who had similar struggles as I did.

13:03.407 --> 13:05.785
Nikita, you look crazy.

13:06.285 --> 13:08.120
-Finally, you can see your lashes.
-F…

13:09.205 --> 13:12.583
I'm gonna beat your ass.
You have too much attitude today.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.596
I started Dragun Beauty
as a trans CEO

13:25.679 --> 13:27.598
to show a success story.

13:27.681 --> 13:33.062
It's a brand made by a trans woman,
um, for trans people and all people.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.396
Wait, let me call…

13:38.609 --> 13:40.528
Bitch!

13:40.611 --> 13:41.570
What are you doing?

13:41.654 --> 13:42.571
<i> Eating cereal.</i>

13:42.655 --> 13:45.241
-Oh my God. I miss you.
-<i> I miss you too.</i>

13:45.324 --> 13:47.451
-<i> Hey, babe.</i>
-Okay, Thomas, hey.

13:47.535 --> 13:51.288
Um, wait, I'm actually really excited
for the pool party.

13:51.372 --> 13:55.000
I need to get Dragun-ified. Immediately.

13:55.084 --> 13:57.795
I love the Hype House
for the people in the Hype House.

13:57.878 --> 13:59.088
In a twisted way,

13:59.171 --> 14:03.259
I've always wanted to relive
my high school experience as Nikita

14:03.342 --> 14:07.221
because I never got to being a boy.

14:07.304 --> 14:10.015
And for some twisted reason,

14:10.099 --> 14:13.853
all these people have accepted me
for who I am.

14:13.936 --> 14:18.524
And whenever I walk through that door,
it's not Nikita with 10 million followers

14:18.607 --> 14:21.402
and multi-million dollar beauty business,
the hooly-doolies, crazy ex's

14:21.485 --> 14:24.738
and controversies, whatever.
I just get to be Nikita.

14:25.906 --> 14:28.200
Anyways, I will see you tonight.

14:28.284 --> 14:29.910
<i>Perfect. I'll look homeless.</i>

14:31.078 --> 14:33.247
<i>-I'll dress nice.</i>
-I'm not worried about you.

14:33.330 --> 14:35.457
You could wear nothing and I'd be happier.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.626
-<i> Same.</i>

14:37.710 --> 14:40.546
I have a Apple Music,
um, interview before.

14:40.629 --> 14:43.507
Should I put Lil Huddy and…

14:45.509 --> 14:48.095
-…in my Apple Music playlist?
-<i>Hmm.</i>

14:48.178 --> 14:51.515
What are your thoughts
on Chase living in the Encino house?

14:51.599 --> 14:58.105
I have a prediction
that this is a little troublesome.

14:58.188 --> 15:03.068
For the first time, this is a deviation
between the two people and houses,

15:03.152 --> 15:06.906
and the Hype House is a mess.

15:08.115 --> 15:10.075
Anyways, just kidding. Okay. Love you.

15:10.159 --> 15:12.745
I can't wait to see you tonight.
Wear something cute.

15:21.921 --> 15:25.507
I have this philosophy.
I wanna do everything I can and film it.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.427
-Permission to let Calvin jump this.
-Wait, what?

15:29.011 --> 15:30.971
-Car's coming!
-He's going!

15:31.055 --> 15:33.766
Oh my God!

15:33.849 --> 15:35.142
That was so sick!

15:35.726 --> 15:38.687
Life is boring without risk.
Life is boring without taking chance.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.731
Oh my God! Oh…

15:41.273 --> 15:42.524
-Oh!
-Oh my…

15:42.608 --> 15:43.984
Woo-hoo!

15:44.068 --> 15:46.737
I spend, on my YouTube videos alone,

15:46.820 --> 15:49.615
anywhere between
50 to 70 thousand dollars a month.

15:49.698 --> 15:50.950
Oh…

15:51.033 --> 15:53.118
-Holy…
-Oh my God!

15:53.202 --> 15:54.787
I am amazed by the success.

15:54.870 --> 15:58.040
It's higher than the bar
that I wanted to achieve so long ago.

15:58.123 --> 16:00.626
And now I'm living my dream childhood
at the age of 20.

16:00.709 --> 16:01.752
If I'm not playing pranks,

16:01.835 --> 16:04.797
if I'm not setting up a crazy-ass stunt
for someone to do,

16:04.880 --> 16:06.799
then it's not Alex Warren from Hype House.

16:09.009 --> 16:10.177
Oh…

16:10.260 --> 16:12.262
What the did I sign up for?

16:21.981 --> 16:25.275
-The Rolls-Royce or the G-Wagon?
-I wanna take the G-Wagon!

16:25.359 --> 16:26.485
Rolls-Royce it is.

16:26.568 --> 16:27.444
No!

16:27.528 --> 16:29.697
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

16:30.531 --> 16:32.157
-Fine.
-Rolls-Royce!

16:40.040 --> 16:42.418
This dude's like,
"What am I doing right now?"

16:42.501 --> 16:44.712
He's probably like,
"What the is going on?"

16:44.795 --> 16:46.130
It's just so sick, though.

16:46.213 --> 16:48.465
These two douchebags
pulling up in a Rolls-Royce.

16:49.466 --> 16:51.593
Hello! Doing strawberry picking today?

16:51.677 --> 16:53.178
-Yes, sir.
-We just get on here?

16:53.762 --> 16:55.723
-This is so cool.
-Strawberries!

16:59.435 --> 17:00.519
This is so cool.

17:00.602 --> 17:02.229
I wanna learn how to drive this.

17:02.312 --> 17:04.023
Whatever the this thing is.

17:04.106 --> 17:05.232
-A tractor.
-Yeah.

17:05.315 --> 17:07.026
Please don't get a tractor.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.861
How much does a tractor cost?

17:08.944 --> 17:11.071
Anywhere from $5,000 to $15,000.

17:11.655 --> 17:13.073
-I'm getting a tractor.

17:13.657 --> 17:15.284
Kouvr and I met on Snapchat.

17:15.784 --> 17:16.660
Really romantic.

17:16.744 --> 17:18.078
She was living in Hawaii,

17:18.162 --> 17:23.167
and one of our mutual friends posted
a story where she was sleeping like this,

17:23.250 --> 17:24.710
and I thought it was really cute.

17:24.793 --> 17:25.836
I slid up and said,

17:25.919 --> 17:28.255
"That's the most beautiful girl
I've ever seen."

17:28.338 --> 17:29.882
Ow! What the--?

17:30.799 --> 17:33.635
-And we started talking from there.
-You were pretty cute too.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.012
-Thanks, baby.

17:38.515 --> 17:41.018
-Are you okay?
-Goddamn it. That was my ankle.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.023
Anything specific you're looking for?

17:46.106 --> 17:47.900
I just want the good-shaped ones.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.486
-Got it!
-Alex!

17:50.569 --> 17:52.321
I didn't-- That was not my fault.

17:52.821 --> 17:54.448
I didn't-- Here. I'll put it back.

17:54.531 --> 17:56.742
See? It's as if I wasn't there.

17:56.825 --> 17:58.619
Kouvr and I, we've gone through a lot.

17:58.702 --> 18:01.622
I was raised in a very toxic household.

18:02.206 --> 18:05.375
When I was 17,
my mom handed me an eviction notice.

18:05.459 --> 18:09.379
I just left and didn't take anything
except for a computer and a camera.

18:09.463 --> 18:11.298
And so I was homeless.

18:11.381 --> 18:13.133
Around this time, Me and Kouvr

18:13.217 --> 18:15.469
had been talking for 3 months,
already said, "I love you."

18:15.552 --> 18:19.389
Long-distance relationships are hard,
and my girlfriend lives in Hawaii.

18:19.473 --> 18:22.601
We came to the decision that--
She might be able to explain better.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.145
-Thought it was best to move out here.

18:25.229 --> 18:27.940
I told her we had a place to stay,
she flies out, and I go,

18:28.023 --> 18:30.692
"Yeah, about that.
We're gonna be sleeping in a car."

18:34.780 --> 18:36.824
If you're gonna stay, what do we do?

18:36.907 --> 18:38.534
I have no clue.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.160
I want doughnuts.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.162
-Sounds good.
-We're gonna get doughnuts.

18:42.246 --> 18:43.580
I love you, guys!

18:43.664 --> 18:46.041
-We a hundred percent bloomed together.
- Definitely.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.669
We both had negative something
in our bank account,

18:48.752 --> 18:52.506
and we kept making videos and going viral
to the point where we were getting

18:52.589 --> 18:54.967
this amount of money this day
and this money this day.

18:55.050 --> 18:57.970
-We're gonna get the good strawberries.
-Mm-hmm.

18:58.053 --> 19:00.806
I want the biggest strawberry
you can find.

19:00.889 --> 19:02.808
The hardest part
about making relationship content

19:02.891 --> 19:05.644
is separating the business
from the relationship. For sure.

19:05.727 --> 19:09.731
The line between social media
and our relationship definitely blurs.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.734
Not stepping over the line
is very difficult to do.

19:13.360 --> 19:16.155
-Oh, there!
-Big-ass strawberry! Yes.

19:29.459 --> 19:32.504
Ideally, we'd want to shoot
seven looks, but we need six.

19:32.588 --> 19:35.048
This photo shoot is for <i>MADE Magazine.</i>

19:35.132 --> 19:39.428
It's gonna be focused on my new single
I dropped, called "America's Sweetheart."

19:39.511 --> 19:41.013
Let's start off with full-body.

19:42.264 --> 19:45.434
That's it. Alright.
Towards the camera a little more.

19:46.810 --> 19:47.686
Oh, wow.

19:47.769 --> 19:50.731
These are fire. Yeah.
I saw at least a hundred bangers in there.

19:50.814 --> 19:51.940
I'm gonna change.

19:52.024 --> 19:54.318
I love photo shoots. I love dressing up,

19:54.401 --> 19:56.862
picking and choosing outfits.
High fashion.

19:59.072 --> 20:01.575
That looks nice.
That looks great. Look up quickly.

20:01.658 --> 20:03.744
Keep messing with your hair.
Go crazy with it.

20:03.827 --> 20:07.581
And magazine shoots like these
it's like when I'm in my element the most.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.544
-One sec.
-Go for it.

20:13.420 --> 20:16.298
-
-Hey! Look at my set.

20:16.924 --> 20:19.468
What's the inspiration
behind "America's Sweetheart"?

20:19.551 --> 20:21.261
I mean, it's about your breakup, right?

20:21.345 --> 20:22.846


20:22.930 --> 20:26.934
Yeah, it's about a dark time
where I just felt like really alone.

20:27.017 --> 20:29.895
So I was writing about
the death of a relationship.

20:29.978 --> 20:32.648
Text me if you need anything,
okay? Alright.

20:32.731 --> 20:35.317
So you guys are
just friends now, right?

20:36.401 --> 20:38.445
Me and Charli? Yeah, we're just friends.

20:45.410 --> 20:46.411
I love that one.

20:46.495 --> 20:49.414


20:49.498 --> 20:51.333
Go off, friend!

20:51.416 --> 20:53.460
Sorry. Hi, everyone. Sorry.

20:53.543 --> 20:56.797
I'm just in the background. Don't mind me.
Unless you need creative direction.

20:56.880 --> 21:00.509
Nikita and I have
a very brother-and-sister relationship.

21:00.592 --> 21:02.844
She'll come to my room
and ask for a Capri Sun

21:02.928 --> 21:05.430
and be like, "So, Chase,
what's going on in your life?"

21:05.514 --> 21:08.892
"I want to help with all your problems,"
and I'm like, "Alright. Here I go."

21:10.143 --> 21:12.020
Let me see. What's the inspo for today?

21:12.104 --> 21:13.397
It's pants that don't fit.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.774
-How many outfits do we have?
-A few more.

21:15.857 --> 21:17.985
-We got a few more.
-Okay. Hair change?

21:18.068 --> 21:20.320
-Yeah, no. This is the--
-Wait, do we match?

21:20.404 --> 21:23.657
Kind of, yes. It's a little cray.
That is a great photo.

21:24.241 --> 21:26.076
-Friend, you're killing it.
-Thank you.

21:26.159 --> 21:27.703
You look so busy.

21:27.786 --> 21:31.123
Does it get crazy to keep everything
in order with social media and stuff?

21:31.206 --> 21:34.251
So hard. I'm leaving from this,
packing, flying out.

21:34.334 --> 21:38.213
Have you talked to Thomas and Alex
about your involvement with everything?

21:38.297 --> 21:40.382
I don't knock anyone's hustle

21:40.465 --> 21:43.385
but I think I worry
that Chase will stray too far.

21:43.468 --> 21:46.638
I've seen so many people try to start
their own businesses

21:46.722 --> 21:49.808
or become actors, or whatever,
and you can do all that and more.

21:49.891 --> 21:53.395
But when you forget where you started,
that's when things get really weird.

21:53.478 --> 21:56.023
When was the last time you saw
Thomas, Alex, and everyone?

21:56.106 --> 21:59.234
I feel like I haven't seen you
at the actual house in forever.

21:59.318 --> 22:02.904
-Maybe we need to catch up.
-Yeah, just like a little, chill talk.

22:02.988 --> 22:05.449
I don't know.
It's a simple conversation, but boys…

22:06.033 --> 22:07.951
-y'all are hard to talk to.
-Yeah.

22:08.035 --> 22:11.788
That's why I switched over. I said,
"The male species and communication…"

22:13.332 --> 22:14.249
…"needs some work."

22:14.333 --> 22:16.168
-Let's do it with the next look?
-Yeah.

22:16.251 --> 22:17.919
-Go change. Go, sir.
-Alright. Thank you.

22:18.003 --> 22:20.422
-Let me know if you need a touch-up.
-I'll be back in a sec.

22:20.505 --> 22:23.925
Do you guys have Dragun Beauty here
or was it sold out?

22:24.009 --> 22:28.430


22:35.854 --> 22:37.939
I have to blow them up
with my mouth?

22:39.483 --> 22:42.861
There's no way I'm blowing this up.
Where's everyone else?

22:42.944 --> 22:45.864
You're looking small for a pool party.
You gotta pump.

22:45.947 --> 22:49.409
-You're so right, dude. You're so right.

22:49.493 --> 22:55.832
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, ten.

22:55.916 --> 22:58.210
-Am I pumped, huge?
-You're good. You're jacked.

22:58.293 --> 22:59.252
Okay. Good.

23:00.587 --> 23:02.089
-Is that it?
-Yeah.

23:07.427 --> 23:10.055
Oh no. Not the Huddymobile.

23:20.816 --> 23:23.693
-What's up? My man.
-What's good?

23:23.777 --> 23:24.861
Hello!

23:24.945 --> 23:27.447
-We all moved and I didn't see them.
-Hi.

23:27.531 --> 23:28.407
Mia!

23:28.490 --> 23:31.243
-Hello, Lil Huddy.
- Hi! You are so big!

23:31.326 --> 23:32.160
Mm!

23:32.911 --> 23:37.207
Before Chase moved out, I'd always
looked at him as a little brother.

23:37.290 --> 23:38.959
Good to see you, bro.

23:39.042 --> 23:40.085
It's been a second.

23:40.168 --> 23:44.464
There's a little bit of tension
because we have some unfinished business

23:44.548 --> 23:48.135
and his lack of involvement
needs to be discussed.

23:48.927 --> 23:50.804
-Who's grilling?
-Connor?

23:50.887 --> 23:53.306
-Need help?
-We got it. Think we're going there.

23:53.390 --> 23:56.184
Where are we going?
Oh, the pool. Oh, hell, yeah.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.107
-Got it!
-Oh my God!

24:04.651 --> 24:07.946
-Does anyone want any coconut?
-We doing that TikTok?

24:08.029 --> 24:08.864
Yeah.

24:08.947 --> 24:11.199
One, two.
And then you'll land on the third beat.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.243
-Yeah.
-We just walk into frame and do it?

24:13.326 --> 24:14.161
Yeah, yeah.

24:14.244 --> 24:15.954
I'm gonna do, "Three, two, one."

24:16.037 --> 24:19.499
I'm making videos at the pool party,
you know, doing backflips.

24:25.088 --> 24:28.258
It is important to keep creating content
for the house as a group.

24:28.341 --> 24:30.594
A little contribution could go a long way.

24:30.677 --> 24:33.180
If everybody posts on the account
now and again,

24:33.263 --> 24:35.182
it would be great,
especially for the community.

24:35.891 --> 24:38.268
Someone on our story said,
"Y'alls' form sucks."

24:38.351 --> 24:39.352
Good.

24:40.770 --> 24:43.106
Oh my God!

24:46.401 --> 24:47.819
Chase is here!

24:49.362 --> 24:52.657
Before we make our appearance,
let's freshen up, girls.

24:52.741 --> 24:54.951
By freshen up,
I mean I have to do some mouthwash.

24:58.371 --> 24:59.456
Ew, ew, ew.

24:59.539 --> 25:02.334
Family's here, guys.
I'm ready to film for Netflix.

25:02.417 --> 25:04.336
Oh! He hit my balls!

25:04.836 --> 25:05.795
Interview over.

25:05.879 --> 25:07.506
-Yeah, right.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.052
My name is Larray Merritt.

25:12.135 --> 25:14.804
I am 22-years-old.
I am from Compton, California.

25:14.888 --> 25:18.391
I currently live in Encino, which means
a bitch made it out the ghetto.

25:18.475 --> 25:19.851
Should we take this?

25:19.935 --> 25:21.311
-The fountain?
-Yeah.

25:21.394 --> 25:23.563
-How do you take it?
-We'll hire someone.

25:23.647 --> 25:25.774
When the Hype House announced
that I joined,

25:25.857 --> 25:28.068
the entire Internet on me.

25:28.151 --> 25:30.403
A lot of my fans
thought Hype House was cringey.

25:30.487 --> 25:32.864
So they were like,
"What the are you doing?"

25:32.948 --> 25:34.866
They were saying I'm whitewashed.

25:34.950 --> 25:37.827
They were saying
my Black card was revoked.

25:37.911 --> 25:41.498
People thought the Hype House was just
these white kids

25:41.581 --> 25:45.085
that just came out of nowhere
with money and rich families.

25:45.168 --> 25:48.088
When it wasn't that, it was
a bunch of kids with different stories,

25:48.171 --> 25:50.674
they all came along together
and were dope as…

25:54.886 --> 25:56.137
Give me a hug.

25:56.221 --> 26:00.392
No! Please, stop!

26:00.475 --> 26:01.560
No, stop!

26:01.643 --> 26:03.979
Let go of me! Let go!

26:04.062 --> 26:05.939
I am not going! No!

26:06.439 --> 26:09.442
Joining the Hype House,
I would not be as big as I am today.

26:09.526 --> 26:11.987
Hype House definitely put me
into the more mainstream.

26:12.070 --> 26:15.699
It made people talk about me like,
"Who the is this?" It was insane.

26:21.871 --> 26:23.873
-Hello.
-Well, well, well.

26:23.957 --> 26:26.751
Oh my God, it's a stripper from Las Vegas!

26:26.835 --> 26:30.630
-Who ordered the hooker?
-If I'm a hooker, I'm expensive.

26:30.714 --> 26:32.966
I'm the closest with Larray.

26:33.049 --> 26:36.678
We grew an amazing connection
because he brought me around Hype House

26:36.761 --> 26:38.722
and he introduced me to everyone.

26:38.805 --> 26:41.099
-Oh my God, hi.
-What's happening here?

26:41.182 --> 26:43.685
-Caught. Nikita And Larray.
-Hype House happy ending.

26:43.768 --> 26:47.606
Nikita is an amazing friend.
She will always be there for you.

26:47.689 --> 26:51.526
She's one of those girls that I wish
I was her friend in high school

26:51.610 --> 26:53.194
because she's so cool.

26:54.654 --> 26:57.324
I need some, like, sexy men.
Like, shirtless.

26:57.407 --> 27:00.160
Larray, in a lot of ways,
has defended me through so much.

27:00.243 --> 27:03.330
He truly accepts me for me,
and I accept him for him.

27:03.413 --> 27:05.165
It's me and Larray versus them.

27:05.248 --> 27:06.207
Okay, perm.

27:06.291 --> 27:08.752
-The gays versus the straights?
-Mm-hmm.

27:10.503 --> 27:11.838
-Damn!
-Oh…

27:11.921 --> 27:13.256
She's in Dragun Mode.

27:13.340 --> 27:16.593
I feel like the reason me and Nikita
are super close is because, for me,

27:16.676 --> 27:19.971
it's more comfortable to have somebody
a part of the LGBTQ+ member.

27:20.055 --> 27:23.642
It's just nice to have someone that gets
my personality and sense of humor.

27:24.309 --> 27:25.977
Whoo! That was good.

27:27.937 --> 27:33.276
Larray is my BFF, and being so,
we have gotten in real arguments

27:33.360 --> 27:34.944
but that's why we are so close.

27:35.028 --> 27:36.863
Mm, move your claws.

27:36.946 --> 27:39.282
Okay, sorry. It says "danger" on my back.

27:39.366 --> 27:42.243
Sometimes, I'm like,
"Am I about to punch her in her nose?"

27:42.327 --> 27:44.829
"Am I about to fight her or hug her?"

27:44.913 --> 27:48.667
We have little arguments but get over it.
We kiss and make up. Literally.

27:48.750 --> 27:51.795
Do I roundhouse kick this bitch,
or do I kiss her?

27:52.796 --> 27:53.963
Stay tuned to find out.

27:55.423 --> 27:58.718
Hey, folks.
I feel like I'm watching <i>Animal Planet</i>.

27:58.802 --> 28:00.637
-Hey, Chase-ifer.
-What's up, Nikita?

28:00.720 --> 28:03.348
-Call me "best friend."
-What's up, best friend?

28:03.431 --> 28:04.683
Nothing much.

28:06.059 --> 28:09.020
Is it weird being back
at the house with everybody?

28:09.104 --> 28:11.022
Not at all, I feel like nothing's changed.

28:11.106 --> 28:12.899
Have you talked to Thomas at all?

28:12.982 --> 28:14.359
Not yet. No.

28:14.442 --> 28:17.153
You were here three hours
before I got here

28:17.237 --> 28:18.947
and you did not talk to Thomas?

28:19.030 --> 28:21.116
-No.
-Oh my God! Thomas!

28:23.535 --> 28:26.663
Before it was so much easier
when they all lived in Hype House,

28:26.746 --> 28:28.873
not Hype House A and Hype House B.

28:28.957 --> 28:32.961
Chase and Thomas need to talk.
This is gonna affect Hype House immensely.

28:33.044 --> 28:37.132
They're the two leaders of the Hype House.
They were the ones that created it.

28:37.215 --> 28:41.428
I'm gonna just, you know, go call someone
or a boy or whatever, while you do that.

28:41.511 --> 28:43.680
'Cause I can't be here.
Okay, bye, love you!

28:43.763 --> 28:46.808
-All good. Bye, Nikita.
-How've you been?

28:46.891 --> 28:50.729
I've been good,
but I feel like I'm a friend.

28:50.812 --> 28:54.065
And I feel like I haven't
been reaching out enough.

28:54.149 --> 28:54.983
It's okay.

28:55.066 --> 28:57.193
I love you. You're like a brother to me.

28:57.277 --> 28:59.195
You'll always be family to me.

28:59.279 --> 29:01.573
My problem with this
is the unappreciativeness.

29:01.656 --> 29:02.490
Like,

29:03.283 --> 29:06.995
I have put hours and hours
and hours and hours into this brand.

29:07.078 --> 29:10.123
I've helped you from the start
with anything you need,

29:10.206 --> 29:12.584
then I didn't see you for three months.

29:12.667 --> 29:15.378
This is stuff I've been
wanting to build to for a long time,

29:15.462 --> 29:18.840
and it's kind of started
to become real now.

29:18.923 --> 29:22.969
But that's probably been one of
the biggest divides between all of us.

29:23.052 --> 29:25.597
It hurts that me, him,
and Alex would always say,

29:25.680 --> 29:28.266
"Well, at least we'll always be around,"

29:28.349 --> 29:29.976
but he's bailed on all of us.

29:30.059 --> 29:31.811
It's, like, awkward for me.

29:32.562 --> 29:36.566
Am I doing social media,
am I this public figure? I don't know.

29:36.649 --> 29:40.445
I feel like I'm not, like, that anymore.

29:40.528 --> 29:43.782
At some point,
I gotta help myself and build up my career

29:43.865 --> 29:46.242
and surround myself
with people that wanna help me.

29:46.910 --> 29:47.994
I don't know.

29:48.870 --> 29:51.581
I just feel like
I gotta stay in L.A. for my music

29:51.664 --> 29:54.709
and focus on finishing my album.

29:55.668 --> 29:57.837
Chase stayed in L.A.
when we moved out here

29:57.921 --> 29:59.047
for a couple of reasons.

29:59.130 --> 30:02.801
I think Charli was part of the motivation
with him staying in L.A.,

30:02.884 --> 30:04.761
and so was music.

30:04.844 --> 30:06.137
One outweighed the other.

30:06.221 --> 30:09.098
You guys can decide
what you think what that one was.

30:10.141 --> 30:14.813
I'm spending all of my time
fully devoting myself to being a musician.

30:14.896 --> 30:18.274
That sacrifice came
with a lot of consequences.

30:18.358 --> 30:22.403
That being me not being able
to see my friends as much.

30:22.487 --> 30:25.824
On Hype House, I don't really know
where I stand right now.
