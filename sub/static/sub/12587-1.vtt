00:34.535 --> 00:36.833
I'll have another giant
lollipop, my good man.

00:37.037 --> 00:40.382
But this time, put a wig on it.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.503
(gasps)

00:44.503 --> 00:47.382
I didn't know you could do that.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.429
Yeah, I know all
the secret menus, Bobby.

00:49.424 --> 00:51.097
Like, if you go
just about anywhere

00:51.093 --> 00:52.811
and ask for a "Hugging Cow,"

00:52.803 --> 00:54.805
you'll get a burger
wrapped in pastrami.

00:54.805 --> 00:55.931
(chewing noisily)

00:55.931 --> 00:59.105
Mr. Dauterive, there is so much
I can learn from you.

00:59.101 --> 01:00.102
Dad...

01:00.102 --> 01:01.524
No.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.522
Go a little slower
with the junk food, Bill.

01:06.608 --> 01:07.609
(stomach rumbles and growls)

01:07.609 --> 01:08.610
(Bill whimpers)

01:08.610 --> 01:09.611
Bill?

01:09.611 --> 01:11.830
(moaning quietly)

01:11.822 --> 01:12.789
Bill?

01:13.865 --> 01:15.617
(groans)

01:18.954 --> 01:21.252
(chewing noisily)

01:21.248 --> 01:23.546
Sergeant, you passed out
from a blood sugar spike.

01:23.542 --> 01:26.671
Looks like you're in the early
stages of adult-onset diabetes.

01:26.670 --> 01:28.638
Diabetes?!

01:28.630 --> 01:29.847
That can't be right.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.513
I've eaten lots of sugar
my whole life

01:31.508 --> 01:32.930
and nothing's ever
happened to me.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.520
Surely you've noticed
recent changes in your body:

01:35.512 --> 01:37.185
Blurred vision,
frequent urination,

01:37.180 --> 01:38.727
tingling in the hands and feet?

01:38.724 --> 01:40.897
I just thought I was in love.

01:40.892 --> 01:41.939
How did this happen?

01:41.935 --> 01:43.278
Seriously?

01:45.522 --> 01:48.822
Diabetes is very common
among the obese.

01:48.817 --> 01:51.491
For some people, there's even
a genetic disposition...

01:51.486 --> 01:52.863
Damn genes!

01:53.030 --> 01:55.749
Diabetes is a very
manageable disease.

01:55.741 --> 01:57.960
If you do a better job
with diet and exercise,

01:57.951 --> 01:59.749
you'll stop it from progressing.

01:59.745 --> 02:01.793
Yeah, genes!

02:03.957 --> 02:06.551
Well, they say diabetes
can happen to anyone,

02:06.543 --> 02:08.419
and "anyone" usually means Bill.

02:08.419 --> 02:11.094
My genes have been
plotting to kill me

02:11.089 --> 02:13.183
since the day I was born.

02:13.175 --> 02:15.644
Yeah, you keep talking
about your genes,

02:15.636 --> 02:17.138
but what about your diet?

02:17.137 --> 02:18.639
Hank, it's not my fault!

02:18.639 --> 02:20.562
My pancreas went out on me.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.355
Yes, it probably is.

02:22.351 --> 02:24.820
You've got to start taking
better care of yourself.

02:24.811 --> 02:28.611
I just lose control
when I'm around food.

02:28.607 --> 02:30.951
I don't even know
where this hot dog came from!

02:30.942 --> 02:32.319
You got to help me, Hank!

02:32.319 --> 02:35.539
Okay, Bill, I'll go with you
to the grocery store,

02:35.530 --> 02:38.329
but only if you're serious
about changing your diet.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.874
I know you only let me
say it on Thanksgiving,

02:41.036 --> 02:42.913
but I'm grateful for you, Hank.

02:50.921 --> 02:52.673
(both grunting)

02:52.673 --> 02:54.300
But it's carrots!

02:54.299 --> 02:57.223
We already went over this
with the zucchini muffins.

02:57.219 --> 02:58.562
Oh, I give up!

02:58.553 --> 03:00.305
It's my mom's fault.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.228
When I was sad,
she'd give me cookies.

03:02.224 --> 03:04.943
But when I was happy,
she'd give me cookies.

03:04.935 --> 03:07.734
All of my emotions
demand cookies, Hank!

03:11.108 --> 03:12.781
(sighs)

03:14.903 --> 03:18.248
Let's see... for dinner,
I ate a lean chicken breast,

03:18.240 --> 03:19.833
some broccoli,

03:19.825 --> 03:21.793
and one cookie.

03:24.079 --> 03:26.047
(chewing noisily)

03:31.086 --> 03:32.429
(groans)

03:36.717 --> 03:38.594
You know, diabetics like him
could really benefit

03:38.593 --> 03:40.516
from some basic
nutrition counseling.

03:40.512 --> 03:41.934
Oh, that's an
interesting theory.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.932
But you know what I
learned at med school?

03:43.932 --> 03:44.933
Oh, that's right.

03:44.933 --> 03:45.900
You weren't there.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.488
You may see a diabetic,
but what I see is

03:49.479 --> 03:51.823
a diabetic who will never
get his act together.

03:52.858 --> 03:54.155
Oh, I see that

03:54.151 --> 03:56.324
under "Are you taking
any medications?"

03:56.319 --> 03:57.821
you wrote "Jell-O."

03:57.821 --> 03:59.949
Mm-hmm. I wrote that
so I wouldn't forget to ask.

03:59.948 --> 04:00.949
Three, please.

04:00.949 --> 04:03.372
You probably want me to say

04:03.368 --> 04:05.962
that you can just diet and
exercise your way out of this.

04:05.954 --> 04:08.082
But two blood sugar
spikes in a week.

04:08.081 --> 04:11.130
Let's face it: Sooner or later,
this will kill you.

04:11.126 --> 04:12.173
Probably sooner.

04:12.169 --> 04:14.171
What... What should I do?

04:14.171 --> 04:16.219
Well, we have plenty
of nice pamphlets

04:16.214 --> 04:17.636
that I'm sure you'll ignore.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.930
But this is how I see
your diabetes playing out.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.394
First comes heart disease,

04:21.386 --> 04:24.356
(whimpering) then kidney
failure, then blindness.

04:24.347 --> 04:26.941
Oh, and you'll lose your legs,
to gangrene.

04:26.933 --> 04:29.857
(whimpering)

04:29.853 --> 04:31.150
Wait...

04:31.146 --> 04:33.274
Are you just
giving me tough love?

04:33.273 --> 04:34.650
Have you seen other doctors?

04:34.649 --> 04:35.525
Yes.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.527
Did they tell you
to diet and exercise?

04:37.527 --> 04:38.323
Yes.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.412
Did you do it?

04:40.447 --> 04:42.120
(whimpers)

04:42.115 --> 04:43.913
Here, take this.

04:43.909 --> 04:45.502
You'll end up in a
wheelchair anyway.

04:45.494 --> 04:48.464
Might as well get one now, while
you still have good insurance.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.336
You know, it's amazing
we never get sunburned.

04:54.336 --> 04:55.383
Yep.

04:55.378 --> 04:56.379
Mm-hmm.

04:56.379 --> 04:57.847
(sighs)

04:57.839 --> 05:00.092
I can't believe Bill's
in the hospital again.

05:00.091 --> 05:03.186
After all the time I spent
with him grocery shopping.

05:03.178 --> 05:04.395
What did you expect?

05:04.387 --> 05:06.515
Bill can't keep his hands
off the sweets.

05:06.515 --> 05:08.108
He's just like Winnie the Pooh.

05:08.099 --> 05:09.976
Who also has diabetes.

05:17.526 --> 05:19.244
Is that Bill?

05:19.236 --> 05:21.159
Bill?

05:21.154 --> 05:22.952
What the heck is going on?

05:22.948 --> 05:24.825
Why are you in a wheelchair?

05:24.825 --> 05:25.826
Oh, this?

05:25.826 --> 05:26.952
No, I'm okay.

05:26.952 --> 05:29.171
I'm just gonna lose
my legs and then die.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.163
See ya later.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.712
(electric motor whirring)

05:42.926 --> 05:46.180
Take with food,
take without food.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.681
It's all so confusing.

05:47.681 --> 05:48.853
(sighs)

05:48.849 --> 05:50.897
No one ever said
the d-life was easy.

05:50.892 --> 05:52.235
The d-life?

05:52.227 --> 05:53.649
Diabetic life.

05:53.645 --> 05:56.899
He probably has to use
so many abbreviations

05:56.898 --> 05:59.447
because there's so
little time left.

05:59.442 --> 06:00.944
I got to tell you, Bill,

06:00.944 --> 06:03.948
I'm surprised your diabetes
advanced so quickly.

06:03.947 --> 06:05.949
As a Diabetic-American,

06:05.949 --> 06:07.951
you can never know
what's coming your way.

06:07.951 --> 06:10.124
Dr. Weissman said
it's only a matter of time

06:10.120 --> 06:11.997
before I lose
more than just legs.

06:20.922 --> 06:22.890
(grunting)

06:30.682 --> 06:34.277
Well, don't worry, buddy,
we're here to take care of you.

06:34.269 --> 06:35.737
Whatever you need.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.948
And we're gonna start
by retrofitting your house.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.691
Thanks, guys.

06:39.691 --> 06:43.195
I'm gonna go read my "Footprints
in the Sand" poster now.

06:47.532 --> 06:50.502
He's being so brave.

06:50.493 --> 06:52.962
Ah, you should've
seen him, Peggy.

06:52.954 --> 06:56.834
You could never really describe
Bill as "able-bodied" before,

06:56.833 --> 06:58.506
but now it's not even an option.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.924
Well, rest assured that diabetes

07:00.921 --> 07:02.923
is not happening to this family.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.517
Which is why I've
already made some changes

07:05.508 --> 07:08.227
at La Cocina de Peggy.

07:08.219 --> 07:11.393
Come on, Mom, I'm just a kid.

07:11.389 --> 07:14.518
This carrot is just like
that lollipop at the fair.

07:14.517 --> 07:18.488
Only it has a wig of alfalfa
sprouts instead of spun sugar.

07:18.480 --> 07:19.823
(groans)

07:19.814 --> 07:21.782
And here's an onion.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.869
(sighs)

07:24.027 --> 07:26.951
This would go a little easier
if you'd give me a hand, buddy.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.699
I don't want to go out!

07:28.698 --> 07:30.371
Just drop me, like God did.

07:30.367 --> 07:31.914
Come on, we're gonna find you

07:31.910 --> 07:34.379
a nice wheelchair-
friendly park.

07:34.371 --> 07:35.543
(sighs)

07:35.538 --> 07:38.166
Or maybe just some
really long pavement.

07:38.166 --> 07:41.921
After I die, I want my ashes
put in a snow globe, Hank.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.137
Promise me that.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.131
You're not gonna die, Bill.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.884
We'll stop and get a new
knob for your joystick.

07:49.928 --> 07:51.976
I want an eight ball.

07:59.604 --> 08:03.905
I used to run and be free
just like them.

08:04.067 --> 08:07.287
Can you help me find
a position of comfort, Hank?

08:07.278 --> 08:08.951
Oh, we forgot your
pillow in the truck.

08:08.947 --> 08:10.915
I'll be right back.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.370
Hey, you want in?

08:17.414 --> 08:19.712
Uh, no, thanks, I can't.

08:19.708 --> 08:21.426
Not with that attitude, bro.

08:21.418 --> 08:23.762
I'm Sam, but I go by
Rolling Thunder,

08:23.753 --> 08:25.676
but I go by Thunder for short.

08:25.672 --> 08:26.924
Wow.

08:26.923 --> 08:29.767
I was gonna call you that
before I even knew your name.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.477
What's up with
the electric wheelchair?

08:31.469 --> 08:33.938
You should shake that Prius for
something that runs on muscle.

08:33.929 --> 08:36.649
Oh, no, my arms
are all I've got left.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.518
I want to use them
as little as possible.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.111
I'm not a fan of
that kind of talk, now.

08:41.104 --> 08:42.856
Check out my ride.

08:43.023 --> 08:46.698
Chrome, crushed velvet,
spinners, bumpers.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.116
I'm in complete control, bro.

08:49.112 --> 08:50.284
Check it out, huh.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.954
I'm stylin', I'm profilin'.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.451
I'm stylin'

08:54.451 --> 08:55.953
and profilin'.

08:55.952 --> 08:59.957
Wow, you just made
walking seem lame.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.082
Hell, yeah.

09:01.082 --> 09:03.176
Come on, I got
a spare one in the truck.

09:03.168 --> 09:04.090
You can have it.

09:04.085 --> 09:05.086
W-Wait!

09:05.086 --> 09:06.463
I can't!

09:10.508 --> 09:11.555
Nice!
Woo-hoo!

09:11.551 --> 09:12.723
Ow!

09:12.719 --> 09:15.097
Hey, ladies, come here
and sit in my lap.

09:15.096 --> 09:17.440
I'll pretend
I'm a massage chair.

09:17.432 --> 09:18.934
(whistles like a massage chair)

09:18.933 --> 09:19.934
(giggling)

09:19.934 --> 09:20.935
(sighs)

09:20.935 --> 09:23.188
You just talked to them.

09:23.188 --> 09:24.690
Hey, hey, are you all right?

09:24.689 --> 09:25.690
Do you need help?

09:25.690 --> 09:27.317
Did he ask you for help?

09:28.943 --> 09:30.570
Oh, he's your attendant.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.289
Yeah, I-I guess so.

09:33.281 --> 09:34.749
I'm Hank.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.288
Are you gonna propose
to me or something?

09:36.284 --> 09:38.958
You know, it's Adam and Eve
not Adam and Steve.

09:38.953 --> 09:39.829
What?

09:44.584 --> 09:46.336
I have to go with him, Hank.

09:46.336 --> 09:48.304
He called me "bro."

09:56.846 --> 09:58.519
Bill looks so happy.

09:58.515 --> 10:01.735
Who would've guessed it was his
legs that were holding him back?

10:01.726 --> 10:03.899
Yep. Bill's been
way more upbeat

10:04.062 --> 10:05.939
since he's been
hanging out with Thunder.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.941
He seems like a good guy.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.911
I mean, he's pretty insulting
to me personally, but...

10:11.069 --> 10:13.663
Hank, we're going out.

10:13.655 --> 10:14.952
You want to come along?

10:14.948 --> 10:17.246
Plenty of room in the
back, for an attendant.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.546
Thunder, I'm gonna
have to adjust this mirror

10:21.538 --> 10:24.257
to get a better view
of my amazing new pythons.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.594
You know, I think I'll stay
and attend to my beer.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.680
That is, if, uh,
if you don't need me.

10:30.672 --> 10:32.345
Oh, yeah, we're okay.

10:32.340 --> 10:34.889
We can take care of ourselves.

10:37.095 --> 10:40.895
My life would be so different
if my name was Thunder.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.767
Or Sean.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.735
(disco music playing)

10:46.771 --> 10:50.867

11:37.947 --> 11:40.746
My word, it looks so tasty.

11:40.742 --> 11:43.962
And yet, I am willing to trade.

11:43.953 --> 11:45.546
Oh, I gotta have it!

11:45.538 --> 11:47.131
Let's trade!

11:47.123 --> 11:48.545
What is it?

11:48.541 --> 11:50.339
It says it's seaweed.

11:50.335 --> 11:51.928
No way, Jose.

11:51.920 --> 11:54.924
But you generally like
eating gross things!

11:54.923 --> 11:55.845
I know.

11:56.007 --> 11:57.759
This surprises me, too.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.161
Whoa.

12:17.153 --> 12:18.530
Nice chair!

12:18.529 --> 12:19.655
Question:

12:19.656 --> 12:21.624
Are those wheels angled
for stability

12:21.616 --> 12:23.459
or just to make you look cool?

12:23.451 --> 12:25.124
Answer: Both.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.712
Thanks, Dale.

12:26.704 --> 12:29.503
Yeah, this chair is built
for ramming into stuff.

12:29.499 --> 12:31.627
Thunder gave me a spot
on his rugby team!

12:31.626 --> 12:33.094
Good for you, Bill!

12:33.086 --> 12:34.508
Okay,

12:34.504 --> 12:35.881
We've lowered almost everything

12:35.880 --> 12:37.507
in your house by two feet.

12:37.507 --> 12:39.930
And now we're gonna build you
a ramp for the entryway.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.644
Yeah, that's nice,
but I've decided

12:41.636 --> 12:43.229
I don't need a ramp anymore.

12:43.221 --> 12:46.566
I was thinking maybe we'll build
a basketball court instead.

12:46.557 --> 12:48.559
Got dang, man,
look at you, like a dang,

12:48.559 --> 12:51.938
like dang 'ol Lance Armstrong,
man, gettin' by on one, man.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.656
Inspired, Bill.

12:53.648 --> 12:56.197
Sometimes
it's a man sitting down

12:56.192 --> 12:58.240
who stands the tallest.

12:58.236 --> 12:59.408
It's deep.

12:59.404 --> 13:00.951
Think about it.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.915
Oh, maybe it's the other way
around.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.293

Whoo!

13:17.839 --> 13:18.931
(blowing whistle)

13:18.923 --> 13:20.925
Just because you've
been cheated by life

13:20.925 --> 13:22.768
doesn't mean you can cheat
on my court!

13:22.760 --> 13:24.933
Bill is really
hustling out there!

13:24.929 --> 13:26.101
This is amazing.

13:26.097 --> 13:28.646
He never played rugby
even when he had legs.

13:30.601 --> 13:32.729

13:33.730 --> 13:36.199

No. Wait, no!

14:20.735 --> 14:22.737
I-I'm disabled
like you!

14:22.737 --> 14:24.739
I've got diabetes really bad.

14:24.739 --> 14:25.831
I'll prove it!

(beeping)

14:28.117 --> 14:29.960

14:44.926 --> 14:46.928
What? That's strange.

14:46.928 --> 14:47.895
I... I have diabetes.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.601
I mean, I mean, not right now.

14:49.597 --> 14:52.191
My, my, my sugar level
is pretty good today.

14:58.648 --> 14:59.865
What's going on?

15:00.024 --> 15:02.652
I think that guy stole
someone's wheelchair.

(hissing)

15:11.411 --> 15:13.505
It's nice,

it says Bill yet.

15:16.290 --> 15:18.338
Let's give it a beer.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.423
What is going on?

15:23.423 --> 15:24.845
You're-you're walking?

15:24.841 --> 15:27.890
Uh, yeah, Hank, just
'cause he's a paraplegic

15:27.885 --> 15:29.933
doesn't mean his
legs don't work.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.181
Wait a minute...

15:31.180 --> 15:32.773
Yeah, I can walk.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.642
And I lost my diabetes, too!

15:34.642 --> 15:36.644
What?!
I don't know what happened.

15:36.644 --> 15:39.443
One minute I was
all diabetic-y, and now...

15:39.439 --> 15:40.656
I'm fine.

15:40.648 --> 15:41.945
I don't get it.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.909
Dr. Weissman told me
I was gonna lose my legs!

15:44.068 --> 15:47.288
Hold on, I-I thought
you already lost your legs.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.532
I don't know!

15:48.531 --> 15:50.533
My doctor told me
to get a wheelchair.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.956
When people yell at me,
I do what they say!

15:52.952 --> 15:54.954
So we did all this for nothing?

15:54.954 --> 15:57.503
We've practically rebuilt
your house, Bill!

15:57.498 --> 16:00.092
And I literally dragged
you all over town!

16:00.084 --> 16:02.178
Oh, sure, feel sorry
for yourself.

16:02.170 --> 16:04.138

I can't drink in peace with Bill

17:58.578 --> 18:00.546

18:01.789 --> 18:03.507
S'go.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.587
I'm sorry, Hank.

18:07.587 --> 18:10.511
I'd walk away, but that'd

I don't know
why you're so mopey, Bill.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.927
You can walk again.
You're cured.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.474
No, you don't understand.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.472
I had it all in that wheelchair.

18:18.472 --> 18:20.474
Women paid attention to me.

18:20.474 --> 18:22.852
Buses would lower themselves
before me.

18:22.852 --> 18:23.899
When I'd check the mail,

18:24.061 --> 18:26.940
people would call it a "triumph
of the human spirit."

18:26.939 --> 18:28.941
But now, nothing.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.865
People only cared about me
when I was disabled.

18:31.861 --> 18:32.908
(sighs)

18:32.903 --> 18:34.450
You know that's not true.

18:34.447 --> 18:35.869
Then carry me, Hank.

18:35.865 --> 18:37.458
No.
Case closed.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.919
Bill, people seemed to care
about you more

18:39.910 --> 18:42.959
because you were doing inspiring
things in that wheelchair.

18:42.955 --> 18:46.334
And how am I supposed
to be inspiring with legs?

18:46.334 --> 18:47.927
By running a marathon?

18:47.918 --> 18:49.761
By climbing Mount Everest?

18:49.754 --> 18:51.506
I can't climb Mount Everest.

18:51.505 --> 18:54.475
And it's already been done
thousands of times!

Why, why won't my sugar level
spike again, Hank?

19:29.335 --> 19:32.339
I want things to be like before!

19:32.338 --> 19:33.931
Cut it out! You'll end
up in the hospital!

19:33.923 --> 19:35.391
I know!

19:35.383 --> 19:37.602
That's what I'm trying to do!

19:37.593 --> 19:38.936
Nope, not happening, bro.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.930
All that exercise you got
hanging out with me

19:40.930 --> 19:42.898
got you in control
of your diabetes.

19:44.016 --> 19:44.858
You're welcome.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.360
Why'd you bring him here, Hank?

19:46.352 --> 19:47.399
To rub it in?

19:47.395 --> 19:48.567
I brought him here

19:48.562 --> 19:49.939
to talk some sense into you

19:49.939 --> 19:51.816
because you're acting
like a jackass.

19:51.816 --> 19:53.818
(blubbering)

19:53.818 --> 19:55.866
I just wanted to be special

19:56.028 --> 19:57.871
and inspiring like you

19:58.030 --> 20:00.749
and FDR and Larry Flynt.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.743
Bro, you cured yourself.

20:02.743 --> 20:04.290
That's pretty inspiring.

20:05.871 --> 20:06.963
That's right.

20:06.956 --> 20:09.254
Dr. Weissman said
you'd never walk again.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.673
He told you to give up,
and you didn't.

20:11.669 --> 20:13.671
You beat diabetes, Bill!

20:13.671 --> 20:16.390
Someone'll probably write
a whole pamphlet about you!

20:18.467 --> 20:20.936
You know, if I were you

20:20.928 --> 20:22.896
the first thing I'd do
with my legs is stand up

20:23.055 --> 20:24.898
and kick your doctor's ass.

20:27.435 --> 20:29.437
But for the record,

20:29.437 --> 20:32.407
I don't need legs
to kick anyone's ass.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.694
Dr. Weissman,

20:36.694 --> 20:39.789
my friend Bill would like
to register a complaint.

20:39.780 --> 20:40.952
Ooh.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.621
Are you upset or something?

20:42.616 --> 20:45.836
I said you had diabetes,
not cry-a-betes.

20:45.828 --> 20:48.172
You told me I was gonna
lose my legs!

20:48.164 --> 20:51.794
No, I said your legs
could fail one day.

20:51.792 --> 20:53.544
Possibly... I... I
never said anything

20:53.544 --> 20:55.546
that could constitute
malpractice

20:55.546 --> 20:56.923
under its current definition.

20:56.922 --> 20:57.548
Mm-hmm.

20:57.548 --> 20:59.516
My legs work just fine.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.181
Isn't that inspiring?

21:01.177 --> 21:03.805
