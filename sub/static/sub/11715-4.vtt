WEBVTT

00:02.753 --> 00:04.212
Mmm.
Hey, your wife's here.

00:04.630 --> 00:06.131
Oh, ugh.

00:08.759 --> 00:10.719
There you are.
I've been calling you
all morning.

00:10.761 --> 00:12.304
I know.
I saw it was you,
so I didn't answer.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.184
To get me here
in the flesh?
Tres romantique.

00:18.226 --> 00:19.478
Scooch over.
No, no.
Booth's full.

00:22.189 --> 00:22.857
Well,
then I'll just have to
sit on your lap.

00:22.898 --> 00:23.858
Oh, gross.

00:26.276 --> 00:28.278
Oh, we're still
in the honeymoon phase,
are we?

00:28.320 --> 00:30.447
(GROWLS PLAYFULLY)

00:30.489 --> 00:31.740
Hey, Timmy,
did you do everything
I told you to do?

00:31.782 --> 00:33.283
Yes, Mrs. Dunbar.

00:33.325 --> 00:35.744
I booked the cars,
reserved the rooms,

00:35.786 --> 00:37.078
and personally
brought all your cats
to the kennel.

00:37.120 --> 00:37.872
Oh.

00:39.748 --> 00:43.669
FYI, be careful.
Tiffy needs
her claws clipped.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.880
Yes, thank you.
I appreciate the timelis
of that information.

00:48.966 --> 00:50.551
Are you taking orders
from Liz now?

00:50.592 --> 00:52.720
Yes, it's quite
a bit more work,

00:52.761 --> 00:54.304
but on the bright side,
there's no additional p.

00:56.264 --> 00:58.517
So everything's all set
for the weekend.

00:58.559 --> 01:01.478
Hey, I don't want
to go to Vermont
to look at leaves.

01:01.520 --> 01:02.771
Leaf-watching
in Vermont?

01:03.438 --> 01:04.439
Sounds fun, buddy.

01:08.694 --> 01:10.278
Well, don't laugh, Jeff.
You and Audrey are coming.

01:10.320 --> 01:10.988
Ha!

01:13.240 --> 01:14.074
Oh...

01:15.034 --> 01:19.079
Oh, and, Timmy,
you're driving.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.789
Well, I've got to go.

01:20.831 --> 01:22.541
I promised
I'd put in an hour
at the cat shelter.

01:22.583 --> 01:23.584
No, no, hey.

01:25.002 --> 01:26.795
Please do not
bring another cat home
to my apartment.

01:26.837 --> 01:27.671
I won't.

01:29.006 --> 01:31.132
I'll bring one back
to our apartment.

01:33.176 --> 01:33.886
Toodles.

01:34.887 --> 01:35.930
Oh, that'll be
our cat's new name.

01:35.971 --> 01:36.931
Toodles!

01:40.768 --> 01:41.852
She's a nightmare.

01:43.562 --> 01:44.980
Damn it,
that lady can name a ca.

01:46.398 --> 01:48.442
Sir, you must end this.

01:50.069 --> 01:51.737
Look, it was hilarious
when you were miserable,

01:52.571 --> 01:53.948
but now
it's affecting me.

01:56.742 --> 01:58.201
Were you not just here?

01:58.243 --> 01:59.787
I'm trying.
I keep saying it.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.622
She doesn't listen.

02:01.663 --> 02:03.123
That's what
divorce lawyers are for.

02:04.959 --> 02:07.210
If you need a referral,
just go to Audrey.

02:07.252 --> 02:09.838
She's been collecting
their business cards
for years.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.840
Well, instead
of watching football,

02:11.882 --> 02:13.216
I get to go
to stupid Vermont, so...

02:13.926 --> 02:14.969
Thank your dumb wife.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.472
What kind of lame ass
wants to drive up

02:18.513 --> 02:20.390
three hours
to look at leaves?

02:20.432 --> 02:22.267
Hey, hey.
Liz just invited us to o
check out the leaves.

02:22.977 --> 02:24.227
This is gonna be epic.

02:27.188 --> 02:28.857
How do you figure?

02:28.899 --> 02:31.986
What, you guys aren't
into leaf-peeping?

02:32.027 --> 02:32.945
Nut up, bros.

02:35.030 --> 02:35.864
Nut up.

03:04.059 --> 03:05.102
No running.

03:08.981 --> 03:10.273
No, don't worry,
Mr. and Mrs. Dunbar.

03:10.315 --> 03:13.610
I've got it.
You're fine.

03:13.652 --> 03:16.446
Timmy, did you have
to drive so windy?

03:16.488 --> 03:17.823
In order to stay
on the windy road, yes.

03:20.659 --> 03:21.869
But believe you me,
I would've been
more than happy

03:21.910 --> 03:25.288
to drive straight
into the nearest tree.

03:25.330 --> 03:26.748
I would've
voted for that.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.627
You shouldn't have agred
to this weekend
without asking me.

03:30.669 --> 03:32.004
I thought
it was a no-brainer.

03:32.046 --> 03:33.380
Oh, so you didn't
involve me

03:33.421 --> 03:36.591
because that would've
added a brain.

03:36.633 --> 03:37.926
You know,
I envy you guys.

03:39.803 --> 03:43.807
I mean,
you've never leaf-peeped
with the A-man before.

03:43.849 --> 03:45.392
You're gonna remember
this weekend.

03:45.433 --> 03:48.854
Not if this place
has a bar.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.313
Well,
I am looking forward
to this, Adam.

03:50.355 --> 03:51.815
I miss nature.

03:51.857 --> 03:53.067
There's nature
in New York.

03:54.026 --> 03:55.777
Hmm, yeah,
if you think nature is

03:57.071 --> 03:58.822
watching a rat
and a pigeon fight
over a condom.

04:01.449 --> 04:05.871
Well, who won?

04:05.913 --> 04:07.039
Welcome, folks.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.584
I'm Henry.
I'm leading a group
on a nature walk

04:10.625 --> 04:12.419
in about half an hour,
if anyone's interested.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.546
Oh, that sounds
fantastic.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.340
Yeah, thanks, Hank,
but I think
I got this one.

04:17.382 --> 04:21.887
Okay, let me know
if there's anything
I can do for you.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.513
Pushy, huh?
All right.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.683
Drop the bags off
and meet back here
in 20 minutes.

04:26.725 --> 04:28.185
I'll brief you
on the peeping plans,

04:28.227 --> 04:29.228
and I'll divvy up
the gorp.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.353
All right?

04:31.271 --> 04:32.231
Hands in.

04:32.773 --> 04:33.732
Okay, I'm out.

04:35.859 --> 04:37.694
So what are you going
to do instead?

04:37.736 --> 04:41.406
Well, I'm gonna
go into town,
peep a movie.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.533
I'll see a movie
with you.
What, really?

04:43.575 --> 04:44.618
You're bailing
on the hike?

04:44.659 --> 04:45.493
Yes.

04:46.369 --> 04:47.621
Hey, Aud,
you want to come?

04:49.123 --> 04:52.251
Uh, no, no.
I... I'm going
with Adam.

04:53.210 --> 04:54.753
Yeah, you guys
enjoy your movie.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.004
That's right.
That's right.

04:56.046 --> 04:57.338
More beautiful leaves
for us to see.

05:01.093 --> 05:06.265
Actually, it doesn't
change the number
of leaves, but...

05:06.306 --> 05:08.725
Yeah, well,
I'm going to take
a rain check myself.

05:08.767 --> 05:10.185
The drive up here
was not kind
to my tummy,

05:11.103 --> 05:12.562
thanks to Mr. Toad's
wild ride.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.276
Hmm, seems like
an appropriate way
to thank someone

05:17.317 --> 05:20.070
for both driving
and paying for gas.

05:20.112 --> 05:21.947
Oh, speaking of gas,
Timmy.

05:21.989 --> 05:25.784
Be a lamb
and go get me
some Imodium...

05:25.826 --> 05:28.578
And something
for the nausea.
Mmm-hmm.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.371
Hey, Liz,
if you're out of commis,

05:30.413 --> 05:31.915
maybe I'll go
hit that movie
with Jeff and Jen.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.084
(SIGHS)
No.

05:35.376 --> 05:36.878
I need you to come
to the room

05:36.920 --> 05:38.172
and hold me
while I lay down.

05:41.466 --> 05:52.560
Double down
on that barf medicine,
will you, Timmy?

05:52.602 --> 05:53.436
Hey.

05:53.979 --> 05:54.896
Oh, hey, hey.

05:56.397 --> 05:58.859
I... I'm just so glad
someone came with me.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.569
Oh, come on.
We don't need
anybody else.

06:01.611 --> 06:04.072
Why don't you get
into your hiking gear,
and we'll get going.

06:04.114 --> 06:05.364
Uh, this...
this is my gear.

06:07.868 --> 06:08.785
Seriously, for a hike?

06:11.496 --> 06:13.165
Uh, I'm sorry,
did they change hiking,

06:14.208 --> 06:15.667
or is it still
just walking outside?

06:18.212 --> 06:20.047
Audrey, the keys
to a successful hike

06:20.088 --> 06:21.298
are multiple layers
and staying hydrated.

06:21.340 --> 06:22.090
Okay?

06:23.633 --> 06:28.889
Please tell me you have
a hydration system.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.557
Yeah, yeah.
Not really much
of a system, now, is it?

06:31.183 --> 06:32.600
This is a system.

06:36.230 --> 06:38.606
Want to hit this?

06:38.648 --> 06:39.607
I don't.

06:40.234 --> 06:41.318
All right, then...

06:42.194 --> 06:48.992
Let's go crush
some foliage.

06:49.034 --> 06:54.622
I wonder if I can
still catch that movie.

06:54.664 --> 06:55.498
Oh, hi.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.584
Would it be all right
if I use that computer?

06:57.625 --> 06:58.668
Oh, yes, of course.

06:59.544 --> 07:02.047
Mr. Bingham, right?

07:02.089 --> 07:03.882
Yeah, Jeff.
Nice to meet you.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.633
I'm Enid.

07:05.675 --> 07:07.052
I spoke with your wife,
Audrey, earlier.

07:07.761 --> 07:08.803
She's a lovely woman.

07:09.388 --> 07:10.638
She's all right.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.226
I'll just swipe you in
with my key card.

07:18.980 --> 07:20.148
Attached
to the old antler there.

07:20.565 --> 07:21.649
(LAUGHS)

07:22.567 --> 07:24.569
Hey, do you know
what the name

07:26.113 --> 07:27.572
of that movie theater ws
we drove by
on the way up here?

07:27.614 --> 07:28.531
The Riviera.

07:29.408 --> 07:31.534
You know
what it used to be?

07:31.576 --> 07:32.327
No.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.210
(THINKING)  Huh.
Charlize Theron...

07:41.962 --> 07:43.463
Pictures of
Charlize Theron...

07:46.049 --> 07:47.842
Ooh, I don't mean
to alarm you, Charlize,

07:48.927 --> 07:50.345
but it seems that
your top fell off.

07:51.346 --> 07:52.431
Oh, my God, pop-ups.

07:53.056 --> 07:54.391
No porn, no porn.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.644
Ugh, I'm in a "pornado."

07:59.313 --> 08:01.982
Go away.
Go away.

08:02.899 --> 08:03.775
Frozen?

08:05.235 --> 08:06.153
Is everything okay?

08:07.862 --> 08:08.905
Yeah, it's all good.

08:11.574 --> 08:13.994
Do you know where
the computer part
to this thing is,

08:15.203 --> 08:16.788
cause I'm done,
so I'd like to
turn it off.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.832
Oh, the computer's here
under my desk.

08:18.873 --> 08:20.292
But we don't have to
turn it off.

08:20.334 --> 08:21.960
I can just come over
and swipe you out.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.295
No, no, no,
just stay.
Sit. Stay.

08:31.970 --> 08:32.720
Sir?

08:34.473 --> 08:36.808
What are you
doing here?

08:36.850 --> 08:38.143
I thought you were
supposed to be
up in the room,

08:38.185 --> 08:39.269
cuddling the missus.

08:41.104 --> 08:42.147
Uh, I finished.

08:44.107 --> 08:45.150
What do you mean you...

08:46.985 --> 08:48.445
You had sex with her?

08:48.487 --> 08:49.863
What choice did I have?

08:51.323 --> 08:55.076
To not have sex
with her.

08:55.118 --> 08:57.454
Ah, we're on vacation.

08:57.496 --> 08:59.164
Bravo, sir.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.875
Anyway, I found
Mrs. Dunbar's medicatio,

09:01.916 --> 09:03.960
although not before getg
some delightful comments

09:04.002 --> 09:08.173
about my ethnicity
from a pickup truck
full of local teens.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.758
I'm telling you,
I can't take this
Liz insanity anymore.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.593
You can't?
She's making my life
a living hell.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.224
I think we both know
what needs to be done.

09:24.856 --> 09:26.733
Sir, you're not suggestg
we kill Liz?

09:26.774 --> 09:28.193
(LAUGHING)
Of course not, Timmy.

09:28.943 --> 09:30.278
We would never do that.

09:34.949 --> 09:36.326
Sir, we can't
kill anyone.

09:36.368 --> 09:37.160
Nertz.

09:39.787 --> 09:42.165
Here, give this
to your wife.

09:42.207 --> 09:44.501
If I go in there,
she'll just give me
another foul task.

09:44.543 --> 09:45.877
No, no, no.
It's your turn.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.170
I just finished
my foul task.

09:49.381 --> 09:51.550
You're married to a womn
you find so repellent,

09:51.591 --> 09:54.010
you won't even go
give her medication?

09:54.052 --> 09:54.928
(GROANS)

09:55.887 --> 09:58.056
Well, I did
just give her an...

09:59.307 --> 10:00.183
Injection.

10:02.643 --> 10:03.562
Come on.

10:04.687 --> 10:05.772
(SIGHS) Focus, sir.

10:07.399 --> 10:09.109
This marriage will
not go away

10:09.150 --> 10:11.903
unless you end it
once and for all.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.197
Just march up there,
dig deep, and summon
all the backbone you ca.

10:15.823 --> 10:18.618
You make
an excellent point, Tim.

10:18.659 --> 10:20.828
Maybe it's time to...

10:20.870 --> 10:29.504
Is that a possum?

10:29.546 --> 10:30.922
Wow, it is so gorgeous
out here.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.173
Uh-huh, keep pace.

10:32.215 --> 10:33.341
(BREATHING STEADILY)

10:35.469 --> 10:36.553
Ah, hydration break.

10:38.221 --> 10:39.931
Can't you walk and hydre
at the same time?

10:39.973 --> 10:41.808
It's a recipe
for cramps.

10:41.849 --> 10:44.144
Keep asking questions.
That's how you learn.

10:44.185 --> 10:44.894
Mmm.

10:46.687 --> 10:48.148
Ah, you look so beautifl
up here, Audrey.

10:49.608 --> 10:51.776
Ah, even this little sag
is getting into the spi.

10:52.693 --> 10:54.112
It's saying,
"I may not be big,

10:55.363 --> 10:58.116
"but I can
change colors, too."

10:58.158 --> 10:59.618
Oh, wait.
I don't think
that's a sapling.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.328
W-w-what's
that saying?

11:01.369 --> 11:03.121
If it has three leaves,
I don't think you're...

11:03.163 --> 11:04.914
(CHUCKLING) Another
teachable moment.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.750
Um, it's "Leaves of thr,
let it be."

11:08.502 --> 11:10.629
It refers to poison ivy.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.797
Now, I'm pretty sure
this is a spruce,

11:12.839 --> 11:14.132
but the one thing
I can't quite figure out

11:14.174 --> 11:15.592
is why it's making
my hands burn.

11:22.723 --> 11:25.185
Oh, my hands...
my hands are
burning like crazy.

11:26.269 --> 11:27.937
I can't believe
I touched poison ivy.

11:27.979 --> 11:30.231
I can't believe
you punched it
afterwards.

11:30.273 --> 11:32.442
Let's just head back
to the lodge
and get you treated.

11:32.484 --> 11:34.319
We're nowhere
near the lodge.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.362
You're the one who wantd
to take the long loop.

11:35.403 --> 11:36.488
Okay, little confession.

11:37.822 --> 11:38.615
(SIGHS)

11:39.616 --> 11:40.783
There is no long loop.

11:42.076 --> 11:44.745
For the last half hour,
we've been totally lost.

11:44.787 --> 11:45.580
Super.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.500
Well, let's head
this direction,

11:48.542 --> 11:51.044
and don't
touch anything else,
or it'll spread.

11:51.085 --> 11:51.878
Uh-oh.

11:52.711 --> 11:53.380
What?

11:54.881 --> 11:56.841
I have to pee.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.885
You're kidding.

11:58.926 --> 11:59.844
Can you help me?

11:59.886 --> 12:00.595
How?

12:01.304 --> 12:02.180
You know...

12:03.848 --> 12:06.226
Take it out.
Oh...

12:06.267 --> 12:08.269
No, I'm not going
to take it out!

12:08.311 --> 12:09.937
Well, I can't touch it,
or I'll get poison ivy
down there.

12:09.979 --> 12:12.065
And then...then
Jen will get it.

12:12.106 --> 12:14.609
Why would Jen
be touching it
if you have poison ivy?

12:14.651 --> 12:22.576
She gets pretty horny.

12:22.617 --> 12:24.578
Hey.
Ready to go
to the movie?

12:24.619 --> 12:25.995
I can't.
I ran into a little...

12:28.873 --> 12:30.625
Little problem.

12:30.667 --> 12:35.255
Oh, my God.
Seriously, here?

12:35.296 --> 12:36.964
It just popped up,
and, uh...

12:38.091 --> 12:38.966
And now it's frozen.

12:40.009 --> 12:42.095
Shut it off,
and let's go.
I can't.

12:42.136 --> 12:44.305
The computer's underneah
that sweet old lady's d.

12:44.347 --> 12:46.224
If I leave, she's going
to know I did it.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.850
What are you
going to do?

12:47.892 --> 12:49.477
Hey, if you get her
out of the room,

12:49.519 --> 12:51.354
I can go turn this off.

12:51.396 --> 12:53.273
How am I supposed
to get her out?

12:53.314 --> 12:55.900
Tell her  Cocoon
is playing
at the Riviera.

12:55.942 --> 12:56.651
Fine.

12:58.777 --> 12:59.487
Hi.

13:00.947 --> 13:03.450
So I was wondering
if perhaps
there is a story

13:03.491 --> 13:05.368
behind that
rocking chair
on the porch.

13:05.410 --> 13:08.246
Why, yes, there is.
It's fascinating.

13:08.996 --> 13:10.164
Come on,
I'll tell you.

13:10.206 --> 13:10.998
Great.

13:16.254 --> 13:18.256
Okay, girls,
now we can go
on the computer

13:18.298 --> 13:19.882
and look up
all the birds we saw.

13:19.924 --> 13:20.925
Still using it!
Sorry.

13:21.384 --> 13:22.260
I'm sorry.

13:23.261 --> 13:24.304
Well, that's okay.
We'll just wait.

13:24.345 --> 13:25.096
Man.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.350
Just working on some
high-end business stuff,
so...

13:29.392 --> 13:30.226
Probably going to
be a while.

13:30.268 --> 13:31.810
Oh, that's fine.

13:31.852 --> 13:33.104
They need to
learn patience.

13:36.733 --> 13:41.237
Let's hope
that's all they learn.

13:41.279 --> 13:42.405
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

13:45.492 --> 13:46.660
Oh, good.
You got my medicine.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.245
Hey,
have you seen Russell?

13:50.705 --> 13:52.457
After we made love,
I fell asleep.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.668
And then when I woke up,
he was gone,

13:54.709 --> 13:56.586
so I thought maybe
he was out bragging
about his conquest.

13:58.630 --> 14:00.715
I don't know.
I have to go.

14:00.757 --> 14:01.591
Oh.

14:02.300 --> 14:03.343
Can you do me a favor?

14:04.427 --> 14:05.720
I have a lot
of dead skin
on my back.

14:07.347 --> 14:08.931
Could you be a lamb
and just slough it off
for me?

14:12.435 --> 14:15.313
Is that a possum?
(GASPS)

14:15.355 --> 14:18.107
Oh, wait, Timmy.

14:18.149 --> 14:19.900
Before you go,
can I ask you
something...

14:20.985 --> 14:23.070
Something that might be
uncomfortable?

14:23.112 --> 14:27.617
I think you just proved
that you could.

14:27.659 --> 14:28.951
I don't think
that Russell

14:28.993 --> 14:30.829
is as into this marriage
as I am.

14:31.705 --> 14:34.499
Does he ever talk
about it?

14:34.541 --> 14:35.416
It comes up.

14:39.170 --> 14:40.839
I mean, when I
hear him say
things like,

14:40.880 --> 14:42.590
"I want a divorce,"
and, "You disgust me"...

14:45.552 --> 14:47.261
I don't know,
I start to feel like...

14:47.303 --> 14:50.306
Maybe something's wrong.

14:50.348 --> 14:51.265
Well, um...

14:53.351 --> 14:55.436
You two did rush
into it.

14:55.478 --> 14:56.103
I know.

14:57.313 --> 14:58.815
I guess I was just
so in love

14:58.857 --> 15:00.567
with the idea
of having a husband,

15:00.608 --> 15:02.652
I didn't spend the time
to find someone

15:02.694 --> 15:03.986
that wanted to
be with me.

15:04.028 --> 15:04.779
Hmm.

15:07.365 --> 15:10.368
Perhaps it's time to adt
that this was a mistake
and move on.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.327
(SIGHS)

15:12.620 --> 15:14.372
I don't know
if I could stand
being alone again.

15:15.749 --> 15:16.624
I could.

15:19.293 --> 15:20.127
Look, um...

15:22.505 --> 15:25.049
I'm sure there's
another man out there
who'd be more...

15:25.091 --> 15:26.300
Appreciative of your...

15:28.302 --> 15:29.387
Particular charms.

15:37.228 --> 15:38.062
Go on.

15:41.482 --> 15:44.068
I'm just saying
I hate having
to see you settle

15:44.110 --> 15:46.320
for someone who
isn't quite right
for you.

15:46.362 --> 15:47.280
I understand.

15:49.990 --> 16:01.377
Good. I'm glad,
because I genuinely
do believe that...

16:01.419 --> 16:05.465
No, no.
That's not what I meant.

16:05.506 --> 16:07.174
Well, don't play coy no,
my little cocoa stallio.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.266
(THINKING)
Ah, I can't believe
I'm in this mess with .

16:16.476 --> 16:18.018
I can't believe
I let her
drag me up here

16:18.060 --> 16:19.437
to crappy Vermont
to look at dumb leaves

16:19.479 --> 16:20.855
on stupid trees.

16:22.440 --> 16:23.608
Oh, yeah.
Everyone's looking
at you now

16:23.650 --> 16:24.901
'cause you're so pretty.

16:26.569 --> 16:27.946
You're just going
to fall off the tree
and die on the ground.

16:27.987 --> 16:28.780
(LAUGHS)

16:31.365 --> 16:32.784
Hey, wait a minute.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.160
Am I going to
end up alone...

16:34.201 --> 16:37.538
Like a dead leaf?

16:37.580 --> 16:39.707
I mean, they're only ale
when they're connected
to the tree.

16:40.291 --> 16:44.003
Is Liz my tree?

16:44.044 --> 16:45.421
This kind of feels
like her back.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.887
Maybe there's a reason
I haven't gotten out
of this yet.

16:52.929 --> 16:55.348
Maybe I just need
to give this a real sh.

16:55.389 --> 16:56.850
Maybe it's time
to finally grow up.

17:00.394 --> 17:01.604
Oh, my God,
those squirrels
are doing it!

17:01.646 --> 17:02.605
(LAUGHS)

17:03.230 --> 17:04.148
Hey, everybody!

17:10.822 --> 17:13.115
And that's the story
of how we got
our rocking chair.

17:16.410 --> 17:17.286
EBay, huh?

17:19.246 --> 17:22.124
I did not see
that coming.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.335
What the hell
is going on?

17:24.377 --> 17:26.045
I was going to turn it ,
but then they came in.

17:28.506 --> 17:29.716
Listen, as fun
as this is to watch,

17:30.800 --> 17:32.468
I'm going to
go see the movie.
Wait.

17:32.510 --> 17:33.511
I got a new plan.

17:35.095 --> 17:37.097
But I'm going to
need your help.

17:37.139 --> 17:38.098
(CHAIR CREAKS)

17:38.975 --> 17:40.727
Sit down
and pretend to type.

17:40.768 --> 17:41.936
What are you
going to do?

17:43.354 --> 17:51.696
I can't explain.
But trust me,
this is going to work.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.240
You know,
I don't think
it was your turn.

17:54.281 --> 17:56.617
These girls have
been waiting a long tim.

17:56.659 --> 17:59.495
Oh, no, I'm just using
until my friend comes b.

17:59.537 --> 18:00.747
I don't think
he's coming back.

18:16.888 --> 18:18.305
Oh, thank God
we found the trail.

18:20.058 --> 18:21.225
Okay, sign says
the lodge is this way.

18:21.267 --> 18:22.018
Okay, okay.

18:23.561 --> 18:24.645
Look, I'm not
gonna make it.
You got to help me.

18:24.687 --> 18:26.022
I'm not taking it out.

18:26.064 --> 18:27.565
Just pull my pants down.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.817
Absolutely not.

18:29.859 --> 18:31.945
Just wrap your shirt
around your hands
and do it yourself.

18:31.986 --> 18:33.571
I can't. I can't.
I wiped my hands
all over my shirt.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.406
There's poison ivy
all over it.
(SIGHS)

18:35.448 --> 18:36.991
Hey. Let me
use your shirt.
Oh, no way.

18:38.076 --> 18:41.037
Please, Audrey,
I'm going to explode!

18:41.079 --> 18:42.162
Jeez, I can't
believe this.

18:42.538 --> 18:43.372
Fine.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.668
What are you doing?

18:47.710 --> 18:50.504
Still got to hydrate.

18:50.546 --> 18:51.505
You're a married woman.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.174
Oh, we both know
my marriage is a sham.

18:55.426 --> 18:57.136
Still, still,
we absolutely
cannot do this.

18:58.930 --> 19:00.807
Come on, we're not going
to make love now.

19:00.848 --> 19:02.558
Kitty just wants to
bat the ball around
a little.

19:05.478 --> 19:06.312
Liz.

19:07.981 --> 19:10.274
I've been doing
some thinking.

19:10.316 --> 19:12.151
I know I haven't
been fully committed
to this marriage.

19:13.111 --> 19:14.070
But I want to make
a fresh start.

19:14.112 --> 19:14.904
You do?

19:16.906 --> 19:19.075
I want you to be the tre
to my clinging leaf.

19:19.117 --> 19:20.701
Oh, you got it,
buster.
Come here.

19:26.749 --> 19:27.917
(SHIVERS) God.

19:29.002 --> 19:31.754
How's it going
over there?
It's not.

19:31.796 --> 19:33.506
My hands are swollen,
and I can't do the zipp.

19:33.923 --> 19:34.799
Help me.

19:35.675 --> 19:36.467
Help me!

19:37.384 --> 19:38.011
Oh, God.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.096
Worst hike ever.

19:42.140 --> 19:46.102
Every time I'm out here,
I'm in awe of the beauty
I see.

19:46.144 --> 19:48.312
Okay, get them down.
Get them down. Look,
I can't wait anymore.

19:52.775 --> 19:54.443
Hi, Hank.

19:54.485 --> 19:58.238
How's the peeping going?

19:58.280 --> 20:29.812
All right, everyone,
continuing up the trail.

20:29.854 --> 20:31.313
ALL: Oh!

20:32.648 --> 20:34.441
Timmy!
Come on, seriously!

20:35.193 --> 20:36.276
Sorry.
