- No.

01:04.300 --> 01:08.200
It was like they were
the only friends i had.

01:09.700 --> 01:12.500
Okay, so what are you
gonna say to her?

01:14.900 --> 01:17.100
I'm gonna say thank you.

01:27.200 --> 01:29.400

01:38.300 --> 01:40.600
Christine, you were pretty rough on
some of your costars in the book.

01:40.700 --> 01:42.100
I just told it like it was.

01:42.200 --> 01:44.400
- How do you think they'll react to that?
- Oh, they'll get over it.

01:44.500 --> 01:47.800
- Steven dorn sounded pretty angry.
- Steven dorn can write his own book.

01:47.900 --> 01:50.400
- He said you better watch your back.
- Oh.

01:50.500 --> 01:53.900
Well, maybe i should have one of
you boys start my car for me.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
Oh, wait, i don't need to.

He gets half a point.

03:26.400 --> 03:30.900
Okay, what color was
the telephone in the living room?

03:31.000 --> 03:32.500
Color?

03:33.500 --> 03:34.500

03:34.600 --> 03:36.400

- He looked at the lunch box.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.800
No point for him. What's the score?
What's the score? What's the score?

03:38.900 --> 03:41.100
I don't know, mr. Monk.
What do you want the score to be?

03:41.200 --> 03:44.200
Okay, okay, final round.
This is for the game.

03:45.200 --> 03:49.500

- I have the episode guide right here.
- No, no, no, no.

03:55.500 --> 03:58.000
Her name was daisy
green in season two.

03:58.100 --> 04:00.800
She got married in
the series finale, remember?

04:00.900 --> 04:04.200
She became daisy-- Come on.

04:04.300 --> 04:05.500
Brackowitz. Pow!

04:05.600 --> 04:08.400
I didn't say, "what was her name?"
I said, "what is her name?"

04:08.500 --> 04:10.700
Is, is. See, i said "is".
You heard me.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.800
Is. Game over. I win.

04:12.900 --> 04:15.100
Have you even seen this show?

04:15.200 --> 04:16.399
Yeah, it was good.
It was called the cooper clan.

04:16.500 --> 04:19.300
Yeah, look it up in your little book.
He's got the little book.

04:19.399 --> 04:22.300
He's got it. Look at your book.
He's got the book.

04:22.400 --> 04:25.500
You know what, mr. Monk,
i'm actually glad we came. I really am.

04:25.600 --> 04:28.700
I've never seen you
this excited about anything.

04:28.800 --> 04:33.000
- This show was important to you.
- Yeah, it was all i had.

04:33.100 --> 04:37.700
No matter how bad things got,
i knew if i could just make it to tuesday night--

04:37.800 --> 04:42.700
8:00, tuesday night--
Everything would be okay.

04:42.800 --> 04:46.600
It would all make sense,
at least for half an hour.

04:46.700 --> 04:48.500
They were like my other family.

04:50.100 --> 04:53.000
Who am i kidding?
My real family was my other family.

04:53.400 --> 04:56.900
- Good morning.
- Oh, is that it? Is that the book?

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Could i--Could i buy that?

05:00.100 --> 05:02.100
Absolutely.

05:02.900 --> 05:03.900
Keep the change.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.200
Oh, wait.
How much is the change?

05:06.300 --> 05:07.800
Never mind. Keep the change.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.900
Re-Cooper-Ating.
I got the first copy.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.700
- First one.
- Cancelled?

05:12.800 --> 05:14.800
I guess you people
haven't heard.

05:14.900 --> 05:17.500
It was on the news.
Someone just tried to kill her.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.900
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.400
Captain, captain,
is she-- Is she--

05:29.500 --> 05:30.600
Is she okay? Oh, my god.

05:30.700 --> 05:32.600
She's okay.
She wasn't in the car.

05:32.700 --> 05:35.300
She had a remote control
starter on her keychain.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.300
Thing saved her life.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.200
Oh, thank god.

05:38.600 --> 05:39.700
Do you know her?

05:39.800 --> 05:42.800
In a way,
i watched her grow up.

05:43.300 --> 05:45.000
You watched her grow up?

05:45.200 --> 05:46.400
Oh, on television.

05:46.500 --> 05:51.000
Yeah, i never missed an episode.
I was kinda obsessed with the show.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.600
Really? Can't imagine.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.400
- Galvanized pipe bomb?
- Yep, black powder.

05:56.500 --> 06:00.100
Electric blasting cap wired to the ignition.
Very simple, very crude.

06:00.200 --> 06:01.900
Anyone who's online
could have built it.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.200
Means anybody could
have done it but you.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.400
We found some
threatening letters.

06:08.500 --> 06:11.600
We're gonna take another look at those,
maybe see what the feds have to say.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.600
Okay.

06:19.700 --> 06:21.800
- That's her.
- Yes, it is.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.600
She got bigger.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.100
Oh, my god.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.100
Oh, my god.

06:28.800 --> 06:32.300
Oh...my...god.

06:32.400 --> 06:35.100
- How is that?
- It's filthy.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.800
I thought i was a wild child.
Look at this.

06:38.900 --> 06:42.000
- That's got to be a typo.
- That is not a typo. And look at this.

06:42.100 --> 06:46.600
"Chapter five: boy crazy.
"There's a list.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.900
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.300
Ricardo montalban.
Dudley moore.

06:53.400 --> 06:56.400
Cheech, chong,
cheech and chong.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.600
Ugh.

06:57.700 --> 06:59.700
Why is there an asterisk
next to bob denver?

06:59.800 --> 07:02.500
- Oh, my god.
- Oh, that's not even the worst part.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.800
Look. Page 73.

07:07.200 --> 07:08.200
Is that even possible?

07:08.300 --> 07:11.300
Oh, this is gonna kill mr. Monk.
He's her biggest fan.

07:11.400 --> 07:14.400
Natalie, there she is.
It's really her.

07:14.500 --> 07:18.400
I can't believe somebody
tried to hurt her

07:18.500 --> 07:21.300
After she brought so much
happiness to so many people.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.600
- We know.
- We've seen the list.

07:29.900 --> 07:31.600
Excuse me, christine.

07:31.700 --> 07:34.500
Miss rapp. Miss christine rapp.

07:34.700 --> 07:38.100
Hello, yes,
this is such a tremendous--

07:39.700 --> 07:41.100
I'm, uh--

07:41.800 --> 07:43.300
I'm gonna keep this forever.

07:43.400 --> 07:46.800
- Why?
- It's actually quite an honor, believe it or not.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.800
Cathy cooper all grown up.

07:50.100 --> 07:52.300
This isn't really a good time
for us right now.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.100
- I'm sure you understand.
- Yeah, i should explain. I'm adrian monk.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.400
I'm working with
the san francisco police.

07:57.500 --> 08:01.700
That's why i'm here.
I'm not some crazy, fanatical groupie.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.200
God, i can't believe
i'm actually talking to you.

08:04.300 --> 08:07.500
I'm natalie teeger.
I'm mr. Monk's assistant.

08:09.100 --> 08:10.400
Natalie.

08:11.300 --> 08:12.500
Natalie.

08:16.100 --> 08:17.200
Why are you wiping?

08:17.300 --> 08:18.600
Tell you later?

08:18.700 --> 08:20.800
- How do you feel?
- I feel very lucky.

08:20.900 --> 08:22.700
- Of course.
- And scared to death.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.100
Of course.

08:24.200 --> 08:27.400
- I'm sorry, i'm kim kelly.
I'm christine's publicist.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.200
Can i talk to you for a moment?

08:29.300 --> 08:31.600
Sure.
I'm just gonna.

08:32.200 --> 08:33.600
Um...

08:34.200 --> 08:37.299
I'm sorry i didn't recognize you.
I've heard your name, of course.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.200
You've helped a lot of
people, haven't you?

08:39.299 --> 08:41.700
- Well--
- I'm scared to death, mr. Monk.

08:41.799 --> 08:44.400
The person who did this,
he isn't gonna stop.

08:44.500 --> 08:49.100
Someone's been sending her letters,
horrible letters, ever since she started writing her book.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.400
Yes, yes, the captain
did mention that.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.400
The police say it's just
an overzealous fan.

08:53.500 --> 08:58.400
We thought so too, but after this,
she needs a bodyguard.

08:58.700 --> 09:02.400
- Bodyguard, right.
- Someone we can trust. I know you're busy.

09:02.500 --> 09:05.100
- Oh, i'll do it.
- Okay.

09:05.200 --> 09:08.800
- $ 1,000 a week, is that fair?
- Hmm.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.800
It's a deal,
i can't pay it all at once.

09:11.900 --> 09:16.900
- No, we would pay you.
- Oh, even better. Of course.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.900
- So glad to help.
- Oh, thank you.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.100
Oh, i'm so relieved.
I can breathe now.

09:23.200 --> 09:25.300
I can't wait to tell christine.

09:25.400 --> 09:27.300
- Welcome to the family.
- Yeah.

09:29.700 --> 09:31.500
I'm in the family.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.500
??

09:41.500 --> 09:44.600
Janey, i can't find
my new beatles record.

09:45.400 --> 09:48.000
Scamp took it.
He likes the beatles.

09:48.100 --> 09:49.400
Our dog is a hippie.

09:49.500 --> 09:52.500
We should have known,
because he hates taking baths.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.900
Scamp, come back here.

09:57.100 --> 10:00.200
Danny, janey, i told you before.
No running in the house.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.700
That's it.
You're both grounded.

10:01.800 --> 10:05.700
- You're not the boss of us, cathy.
- When i'm wearing this, i am.

10:06.300 --> 10:07.900
- Billy, where are you going?
- To the bathroom.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.500
Where's your hall pass?
You need to get one from mom.

10:10.600 --> 10:13.700
Oh, shucky darns.

10:14.500 --> 10:18.700
All i can say is
she better write fast.

10:21.200 --> 10:24.500
Ever since you were elected to the safety patrol,
you've been driving us crazy.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.300
You're like a mad dictator.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.100
- No, i'm not.
- Yes, you are.

10:28.200 --> 10:31.200
Let me guess,
you never miss a rerun.

10:31.300 --> 10:32.500
Reruns?

10:32.800 --> 10:38.800
Are you telling me you know ever line of dialogue
but you haven't seen an episode in 35 years?

10:38.900 --> 10:40.300
Not crazy, just a fan.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.100
I'm proud of you for wanting
to keep people safe, honey,

10:42.200 --> 10:44.900
But here at home,
that's my job.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.300
You don't want to put me
out of work, do you?

10:46.400 --> 10:48.600
I never thought of
it like that.

10:48.700 --> 10:52.400
I guess danny was right.
I let all that power go to my head.

10:52.500 --> 10:55.200
I'm sorry, dad.
I let you down.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.200
Danny's playing
that music again.

11:00.300 --> 11:02.100
Better go have
a talk with him.

11:02.300 --> 11:04.400
Can i borrow your sash?

11:08.500 --> 11:11.700
He was such a great dad.

11:12.600 --> 11:15.000
What was he like,
you know, in real life?

11:15.100 --> 11:16.100
Was he nice?

11:16.200 --> 11:19.100
- You haven't read my book, have you?
- No, not yet. I can't wait.

11:19.200 --> 11:23.000
Oh, listen, let's watch
the babysitter episode.

11:23.100 --> 11:28.000
Could we please? I love the part where
you and janey turn back all the clocks, right?

11:28.100 --> 11:31.200
So that you could stay up later.
You two were such rascals.

11:32.700 --> 11:35.200
How's the investigation
going, mr. Monk?

11:35.300 --> 11:36.100
Anything to report?

11:36.200 --> 11:39.400
Oh, yeah. Well, we have this...

11:40.400 --> 11:42.800
Surveillance photo
from the radio station.

11:42.900 --> 11:46.100
He was standing across the street
before the car exploded.

11:46.200 --> 11:50.600
- The police said he was there all morning.
- Right. Christine said she never saw him before.

11:50.700 --> 11:53.700
- How about you?
- No, sorry. What about the letters?

11:53.800 --> 11:55.900
Well, i'm gonna see captain
stottlemeyer later today.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.900
I should know a lot more then.

11:59.300 --> 12:00.600
What do we do in the meantime?

12:00.700 --> 12:03.400
Well, i suggest

12:04.000 --> 12:08.700
We watch a few more episodes of the cooper clan
and then take a tour of the house.

12:08.800 --> 12:12.800
- Why don't we take a tour of the house right now?
- Oh, shucky darns. Get it?

12:14.400 --> 12:17.200
- That was what billy said.
- Yes.

12:19.100 --> 12:21.900
Could you stop
worrying for five minutes?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.300
It's my job to worry.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.500
* super-Duper cooper *

12:28.600 --> 12:30.600
* cooper clan *

12:36.100 --> 12:38.700
And this, of course,
is the bedroom.

12:40.900 --> 12:43.100
Ah, uh-Huh.
Where does that lead?

12:43.200 --> 12:44.900
The patio.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.200
All right, you want to make sure
those doors are double bolted and change the locks.

12:49.300 --> 12:53.800
- Yes, sir. I'll take care of it.
- Oh, and you're gonna need to black out all those windows.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.700
Buy some curtains.
Make sure they're heavy.

12:55.800 --> 13:00.600
Remember when billy and danny rigged all the window
curtains to make you think there was a ghost?

13:00.700 --> 13:02.800
That was another classic.

13:04.800 --> 13:06.500
A mirror?

13:10.000 --> 13:12.300
Oh, very good.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.300
Excellent precaution.

13:14.400 --> 13:20.300
I see, so that if you're lying in bed
and someone breaks in through that door...

13:23.500 --> 13:25.800
You have the...

13:29.300 --> 13:31.300
Triangul--

13:31.500 --> 13:32.600
Or--

13:34.700 --> 13:37.600
- I don't get it.
- It's more of a personal thing.

13:37.700 --> 13:40.500
You know, you should
really read my book.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.100
Yeah, yeah, i can't wait.

13:44.200 --> 13:46.200
Oh, we have a permit for that.

13:46.600 --> 13:47.600
That was my idea.

13:47.700 --> 13:51.500
I had christine buy one
after she received her first letter.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.800
Good, good.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.300
Hmm.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.700
No.

14:08.700 --> 14:12.600
In season three, episode ten,
you said you were allergic to peanuts,

14:12.700 --> 14:16.200
But then in season five, right,
the bake sale episode,

14:16.300 --> 14:19.400
You ate those brownies
and you never had any reaction.

14:19.500 --> 14:23.700
- Well, maybe dr. Nabors gave me some medicine.
- You mean dr. Norberg.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.900
That's impossible, because
at the end of the tonsils episode,

14:27.000 --> 14:29.200
Dr. Norberg said he was retiring.

14:29.300 --> 14:31.700
Oh, i don't know.
I just--I don't know.

14:31.800 --> 14:34.100
- Do you have any other questions?
- Yes, yes, i do.

14:34.200 --> 14:37.700
- I mean not related to the show.
- Oh, no.

14:38.500 --> 14:41.700
Well, i have a photo shoot later,
so i better get dressed.

14:41.800 --> 14:42.600
Okay.

14:42.700 --> 14:47.000
Oh, do you want to come
with me, mr. Bodyguard?

14:47.100 --> 14:50.800
Oh, no, i don't think
that's necessary.

14:50.900 --> 14:52.800
Shy, huh?

14:53.300 --> 14:55.600
I like that in a man.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
She likes anything in a man.

15:03.900 --> 15:07.800
- Oh, the silver globe.
- Oh, yes.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.500
It's beautiful,
isn't it? - Yeah.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.800
Oh, this hunk of
metal saved her career.

15:11.900 --> 15:14.300
She won it for a tv
movie about anorexia.

15:14.400 --> 15:16.400
The vanishing girl,
i remember.

15:16.500 --> 15:19.500
That was the only
awards show i ever saw.

15:19.600 --> 15:21.900
I was probably
more nervous that she was.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.800
And it went on forever, didn't it?

15:23.900 --> 15:27.100
First that guy came out
and told all those jokes.

15:27.200 --> 15:28.700
- That was bob hope.
- Whatever.

15:28.800 --> 15:33.100
And then the two accountants came out
and went on and on and on about all the rules.

15:33.200 --> 15:36.000
They were from fineman and kelly.
They tabulated the ballots.

15:36.100 --> 15:42.000
Yeah, and then finally they announced her name,
best supporting actress, christine rapp.

15:42.100 --> 15:44.500
God, i was so happy. I was.

15:44.600 --> 15:47.900
I was cheering like, "ahh"

15:51.200 --> 15:52.900
Christine?

15:55.600 --> 15:57.900
He's gonna kill me.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.000
Next time i won't miss.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.300
- How'd he get in?
- I don't know.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.700
- Maybe through the basement.
- She's got to be a mess.

16:06.800 --> 16:10.800
She's a basket case. I told her to
check in to a motel under an assumed name.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Yeah. That's a good idea.

16:13.900 --> 16:15.600
There's no fingerprints
on the lipstick.

16:15.700 --> 16:16.900
No fingerprints on the mirror.

16:17.000 --> 16:22.300
And the handwriting, such as
it is, matches the letters.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.700
They're all postmarked
sunset heights.

16:24.800 --> 16:27.400
Yeah.
Any fibers, dna?

16:27.500 --> 16:30.400
Negative. Envelopes
are clean too.

16:31.600 --> 16:34.900
- Wait a second.
- What is it?

16:37.200 --> 16:40.600
I know this sounds crazy,
but i've seen this handwriting somewhere before.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.100
Where?

16:42.700 --> 16:46.500
- I don't know. Somewhere--
- Well, he's obviously disguising it.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.800
- I mean, he probably uses his left hand.
- That makes sense.

16:48.900 --> 16:51.300
- Or if he was a lefty, he used his right hand.
- That makes sense.

16:51.400 --> 16:54.500
Or if he was ambidextrous,
he probably got drunk and then wrote it.

16:55.200 --> 16:56.500
That makes less sense.

16:56.600 --> 16:59.300
- You want to look at them again?
- I don't have to.

16:59.400 --> 17:00.500
I didn't write them.

17:00.600 --> 17:04.599
- How 'bout this morning, steven, around 7:45?
- I was in bed, alone.

17:04.700 --> 17:07.800
- Well, that's unfortunate.
- I agree.

17:07.900 --> 17:11.200
Keep your mouth shut.
I wonder what he was referring to.

17:11.800 --> 17:12.700
Yeah, mr. Monk,

17:12.800 --> 17:16.700
You really, really need
to read her book.

17:16.800 --> 17:18.700
Yeah, will read it later
when i have some time.

17:19.000 --> 17:19.800
I want to savor it.

17:19.900 --> 17:21.599
No, see, mr. Monk,
this is the thing.

17:21.700 --> 17:24.099
You're not gonna want to
savor this one, believe me.

17:24.200 --> 17:29.400
- Randy, is that billy cooper?
- Yeah, i think that's the guy who played billy cooper.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.300
Is this you?

17:31.700 --> 17:32.400
That could be anybody.

17:32.500 --> 17:35.300
- I didn't ask if it was anybody.
- It's not me.

17:35.400 --> 17:39.400
- Okay, do you own a sweatshirt like that?
- I just told you it's not me.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.300
Am i some sort of
suspect here or--

17:41.400 --> 17:43.200
Shucky darns.

17:43.600 --> 17:46.000
Hey, steven. Hey, shucky darns.

17:46.100 --> 17:47.000
Steven.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.600
Shucky darns!

17:52.000 --> 17:53.600
- Shucky darn.
- Monk, come here.

17:53.700 --> 17:57.800
Yeah, that's what he said on
the show almost every week, right?

17:57.900 --> 17:59.300
You remember? You remember?

17:59.400 --> 18:02.600
Do i remember? Yeah. Yeah,
sorta rings a bell.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.900
- Who is this guy?
- I'm--I'm adrian monk.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.300
Have you been receiving
letters too? Oh, my god.

18:08.400 --> 18:11.200
He's probably after
the whole cast.

18:11.400 --> 18:13.200
Okay, it's gonna be okay.
We got a photo of the guy.

18:13.300 --> 18:15.100
- We got samples of his handwriting.
- Monk.

18:15.200 --> 18:16.400
- Monk.
- All right, listen, we are gonna--

18:16.500 --> 18:17.800
- We are gonna catch this creep.
- Monk.

18:17.900 --> 18:19.700
- Me and him, don't you worry.
- Monk. Monk.

18:19.800 --> 18:22.200
You have my word, because
he picked on the wrong family.

18:22.300 --> 18:25.800
Monk, we are questioning mr. Dorn
about the accident this morning.

18:25.900 --> 18:27.900
He is a person of interest.

18:28.300 --> 18:30.400
This some kind of
a joke, captain?

18:30.500 --> 18:33.800
He was in the cooper clan.
He was billy.

18:33.900 --> 18:34.900
Billy cooper.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.100
- Say, "shucky darns."
- No.

18:36.200 --> 18:39.000
- Come on, just say it.
- "Her former costar, steven dorn,

18:39.100 --> 18:41.600
Declared 'christine rapp
is dead to me.'"

18:41.700 --> 18:45.200
- That is a figure of speech.
- "She's a loudmouth, a liar, and a tramp.

18:45.300 --> 18:48.200
"Next time i run into her,
i hope i'm driving a truck."

18:48.300 --> 18:50.100
Did you say that?
Why would you say that?

18:50.200 --> 18:53.800
Because she's a loudmouth,
a liar, and a tramp.

18:56.200 --> 18:58.700
Are we talking about
the same christine rapp, the actr--

18:58.800 --> 19:01.100
She--She was your sister.

19:01.200 --> 19:03.800
- He hasn't read the book, has he?
- No.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.000
Okay, monk.

19:06.700 --> 19:10.400
I know you're not officially on the force
anymore, and i can't give you orders,

19:10.500 --> 19:14.300
But i am ordering you to
go home and read this book.

19:18.300 --> 19:20.500
Oh, my god.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.700
My god.

19:33.400 --> 19:37.300
Oh...my...god.

19:38.100 --> 19:40.500
- You okay?
- This is horrible.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.900
It's horrible.
What are you drinking?

19:43.000 --> 19:45.200
- Tea.
- Is it hot?

19:45.300 --> 19:47.900
- Yes.
- Good. Pour it into my eyes.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.100
- Mr. Monk.
- Do it, blind me.

19:50.200 --> 19:51.800
You know what,
she's an actress.

19:51.900 --> 19:55.000
They all have problems,
especially when they start that young.

19:55.100 --> 19:56.200
Judy garland--

19:56.300 --> 19:58.800
- What is that?
- I don't know.

19:58.900 --> 20:00.400
Thank you for not knowing.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.000
You're welcome.

20:02.300 --> 20:05.300
This is unbelievable. Of course
someone's trying to kill her.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.200
Anyone she's ever
met has a motive.

20:07.300 --> 20:10.200
Anyone who's ever
read this has a motive.

20:11.400 --> 20:14.200
There's a page missing, page 73.

20:14.300 --> 20:17.900
- Maybe it fell out.
- Pages don't fall out.

20:18.100 --> 20:22.100
Mr. Monk, it fell out.

20:23.400 --> 20:26.100
- It was torn out.
- It fell out.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.600
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

20:27.700 --> 20:29.900
No, no, mr. Monk, you don't
want to see page 73.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.900
- What, it can't be any worse than the rest of it.
- You wanna bet?

20:33.000 --> 20:35.500
- I have to know.
- No, mr. Monk, please.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.200
- Mr. Monk, please.
- It's my book.

20:37.300 --> 20:39.000
Let me see it.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.000
Let me see it!

20:41.100 --> 20:42.800
What are you doing?

20:42.900 --> 20:45.100
It's for your own good.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.600
That's $87.
Is this mastercard or--

20:54.700 --> 20:57.800
- Do you take cash?
- Sure, yeah, cash will do.

20:59.400 --> 21:03.100
- 85, 86, 87.

21:04.500 --> 21:06.100
- Great.

21:08.800 --> 21:12.300
- Do i know you?
- No, you do not.

21:12.800 --> 21:16.800
Okay, room eight
is just up those stairs.

21:52.900 --> 21:55.900
- 911
- Hello, i'm at the safari inn near the airport.

21:56.100 --> 21:58.000
Somebody...??

22:12.000 --> 22:14.200
We'll just be a little while.

22:14.500 --> 22:17.100
There she is.

22:22.900 --> 22:26.800
- Did anybody else know you were here?
- He must have followed her.

22:26.900 --> 22:28.500
Okay, so you checked in.

22:28.900 --> 22:31.200
I checked in.
I was walking to my room.

22:31.300 --> 22:33.500
He was right there.
He just came at me.

22:33.600 --> 22:35.700
- Did you see a weapon?
- A knife.

22:35.800 --> 22:37.000
He had a knife.

22:37.100 --> 22:39.700
He said, "i got you this time."

22:40.800 --> 22:42.700
I had a gun, my gun,
in my purse.

22:42.800 --> 22:44.300
I pulled it out.
I wasn't even thinking.

22:44.400 --> 22:48.200
I just closed
my eyes and bang.

22:48.800 --> 22:52.000
Hey, monk, you okay?

22:53.400 --> 22:55.900
Well, if you're not too busy,
the body's over here.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.200
Thank you.

22:57.300 --> 22:59.200
- So who was he?
- Ah, a nobody.

22:59.300 --> 23:01.900
Well, as close to a nobody
as you're gonna find.

23:03.300 --> 23:05.100
Timlinson.

23:05.200 --> 23:08.400
Yeah. We just ran his name.

23:09.200 --> 23:11.600
Never been arrested.
Not even a traffic ticket.

23:11.700 --> 23:13.300
Manages a taco bell.

23:13.400 --> 23:16.200
Before that, 15 years with
the city parks and maintenance.

23:16.300 --> 23:18.900
Before that, he was in the mail room
at some big accounting firm.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.400
Before that, a couple years
of community college.

23:21.500 --> 23:24.900
Under the radar his whole life
until about an hour ago.

23:25.100 --> 23:28.700
- And he wrote all those letters?
- Yeah, looks like it. We found more in his coat.

23:28.800 --> 23:32.200
Plus the handwriting matches,
at least to me.

23:32.300 --> 23:35.200
Plus he lives in sunset heights.

23:35.400 --> 23:36.700
That's where the other
letters were postmarked.

23:36.800 --> 23:38.600
Why would he do it?

23:38.800 --> 23:41.100
Maybe he loved the show.

23:41.800 --> 23:47.400
Maybe the show meant the world to him,
and she betrayed everything it stood for.

23:49.300 --> 23:51.300
He read the book, didn't he?

23:52.800 --> 23:54.000
Not page 73.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.800
- No, i ate it.
- Good.

23:57.300 --> 24:00.200
Miss rapp, do you
remember signing this?

24:00.300 --> 24:01.600
We found it in his car.

24:01.800 --> 24:05.900
- No, but i've signed millions of those.
I'll bet you have.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.600
Mr. Monk, thank you
for being here.

24:08.700 --> 24:13.900
- And you never saw this guy before?
- No. Maybe. I meet a lot of people.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.200
Yeah, we know.
We read the book.

24:16.300 --> 24:19.600
Maybe you should have called
your friend bob denver.

24:19.700 --> 24:20.600
Mr. Monk.

24:20.700 --> 24:24.200
I'm so sorry. He's never really
read anything like that before.

24:24.300 --> 24:26.300
- Can i take her home now?
- Yeah.

24:26.400 --> 24:30.100
We'll bring the car around front.
We'll deal with this tomorrow.

24:31.800 --> 24:37.600
- I'm sorry to disappoint you, mr. Monk.
- Is it true, the things in the book?

24:37.700 --> 24:41.200
The things--Things you did?

24:41.400 --> 24:45.800
- Not the whole truth.
- I knew it. I knew it. Thank god.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.900
I mean, i've done a lot worse.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.300
I mean, stuff i couldn't
even write about.

24:51.500 --> 24:53.500
I was young, mr. Monk.

24:53.600 --> 24:56.100
Weren't you young once?

24:57.100 --> 24:58.500
Right?

24:59.600 --> 25:01.100
Maybe you weren't.

25:01.300 --> 25:03.600
But you've been lonely.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.600
I can tell.

25:07.500 --> 25:09.300
I was just a girl, mr. Monk.

25:09.400 --> 25:14.600
Just a girl, trying to
be a little less lonely.

25:15.400 --> 25:18.800
I don't have a lot of
happy memories.

25:19.500 --> 25:23.300
Watching that show
was about it.

25:23.400 --> 25:25.200
Now it's gone.

25:25.400 --> 25:28.400
Well, if that's true,
i'm really sorry.

25:29.200 --> 25:31.300
Can you forgive me?

25:32.800 --> 25:34.400
No.

25:43.100 --> 25:45.800
Don't be mad. I know how you hate surprises,
so i'm just gonna warn you.

25:45.900 --> 25:47.300
I'm gonna be surprising you.

25:47.400 --> 25:50.000
- What? When?
- In about ten seconds.

25:50.100 --> 25:53.000
This is sort of a heads-Up,
like a surprise alert.

25:53.100 --> 25:57.700
Wait. You can't just burst in here
and say, "surprise alert."

25:57.800 --> 25:59.700
You have to give me
a little warning.

25:59.800 --> 26:02.100
Oh, okay, sorry.

26:02.500 --> 26:05.200
This is the surprise
alert warning.

26:06.500 --> 26:08.000
This is the surprise alert.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.500
Now...

26:12.900 --> 26:14.500
Surprise!

26:14.600 --> 26:17.700
I called ambrose, and he told me
this was your favorite snack.

26:17.800 --> 26:21.800
Ten round crackers, a glass of
apple juice with one ice cube.

26:21.900 --> 26:25.900
- What's going on?
- And i rented this, your favorite show.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.400
I don't have a favorite show.

26:27.500 --> 26:29.700
Mr. Monk, i know how important
this show is to you.

26:29.800 --> 26:31.800
Okay, you can still enjoy it.

26:31.900 --> 26:33.500
You can still watch it.

26:33.700 --> 26:34.900
All right, all right,

26:35.200 --> 26:36.800
You're 12 years old.
It's tuesday night.

26:36.900 --> 26:39.000
It's 8:00. You've been
waiting all week.

26:39.100 --> 26:40.900
It's cooper clan time.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.200
* make yourself at home
with the cooper clan *

26:43.300 --> 26:45.200
* you'll never be alone
with the cooper clan *

26:45.300 --> 26:48.100
* you got bill, janey,
cathy, and dan *

26:48.200 --> 26:49.400
* don't forget skip *

26:49.500 --> 26:52.900
- It's scamp.
- Scamp, get off that divan!

26:54.000 --> 26:56.800
You wasted your money.
I can't watch it.

26:56.900 --> 27:00.400
You know what, forget about christine rapp
and her stupid, stupid book.

27:00.500 --> 27:02.300
Everybody in hollywood's crazy,

27:02.400 --> 27:05.100
And if we think about that stuff,
nobody would ever to go the movies.

27:05.200 --> 27:07.300
- I don't go to the movies.
- Or watch tv.

27:07.400 --> 27:09.300
- I don't watch tv.
- You get the point.

27:09.400 --> 27:12.400
- No, i don't.
- All right, let's just try it.

27:12.500 --> 27:15.000
Let's just watch one.
Which one do you want to see?

27:16.000 --> 27:17.500
Let's see.

27:17.800 --> 27:19.600
"Where there's fire,
there's smoking."

27:19.700 --> 27:21.200
That sounds funny.

27:21.300 --> 27:26.400
"Slumber party pooper." "Grounded for life."
Well, i mean, they all sound fantastic.

27:29.200 --> 27:32.500
Okay. Let's just play
the first one.

27:46.300 --> 27:50.800
- Episode four, "broken arm, broken heart."
- Ooh, good choice. Episode four.

27:51.300 --> 27:54.100
* make yourself at home
with the cooper clan *

27:54.200 --> 27:57.000
* you'll never be alone
with the cooper clan *

27:57.100 --> 27:58.800
- Picture go fast.
- It just started.

27:58.900 --> 28:01.900
- Picture go fast.
- Go fast.

28:05.200 --> 28:07.100
??, picture regular.

28:07.200 --> 28:08.900
Picture regular.

28:11.300 --> 28:13.600
Hey, jimmy, you want
to sign my cast?

28:17.300 --> 28:20.100
Nobody groovy wants to
sign my cast.

28:31.700 --> 28:33.100
Picture freezer.

28:33.800 --> 28:35.500
Picture freezer.

28:37.400 --> 28:39.200
The "e" and the "t".

28:39.300 --> 28:41.300
- It's the same handwriting.
- As what?

28:41.400 --> 28:43.600
As the mirror and the letters
sent to christine rapp.

28:43.700 --> 28:45.700
I knew i'd seen it before.

28:45.900 --> 28:49.900
She wrote those letters to herself
with her left hand.

28:50.100 --> 28:51.700
Why?

28:58.500 --> 29:03.200
So she could kill victor timlinson
and claim it was self-Defense.

29:03.300 --> 29:04.800
She was setting him up.

29:04.900 --> 29:10.000
- You heard the captain. He was a nobody.
- Well, he was somebody to her.

29:12.100 --> 29:13.600
Hello?

29:14.700 --> 29:16.900
Hello, mr. Timlinson?

29:18.700 --> 29:19.900
I don't think he's home.

29:20.100 --> 29:23.200
Probably not. He's single,
and he's dead.

29:23.300 --> 29:25.200
Oh, yeah.

29:30.700 --> 29:31.700
Wait.

29:31.800 --> 29:33.300
Are you going in?

29:34.300 --> 29:37.000
- It'd be a crime not to.
- It'd be a crime if we did.

29:37.100 --> 29:39.200
So it doesn't matter either way.

29:47.500 --> 29:49.900
- Oh.
- Ew.

29:50.400 --> 29:52.700
- Don't touch anything.
- I'll try not to.

29:52.800 --> 29:54.900
I was talking to myself.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.400
Oh. So what are we looking for?

29:58.500 --> 30:02.300
A connection between
this guy and christine rapp.

30:02.400 --> 30:07.300
She killed him on purpose,
so they must have known each other.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.100
I don't see anything.

30:11.700 --> 30:14.700
Exactly. That's what's wrong.

30:15.200 --> 30:18.400
I mean, he was obsessed
with her, remember?

30:18.500 --> 30:20.100
Where are the pictures?

30:20.200 --> 30:22.900
Where's his cooper clan
lunch box?

30:23.200 --> 30:25.900
- There should be a shrine.
- Yeah.

30:26.100 --> 30:28.100
I'll go check in back.

30:35.800 --> 30:38.300
Interior decorating?

30:39.800 --> 30:42.000
I don't think so.

30:57.200 --> 31:00.700
Ballot

31:23.800 --> 31:25.200
Natalie.

31:25.500 --> 31:27.900
Natalie, look at this.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.600
I got it.

31:40.900 --> 31:43.200
You know, this was your mother's
favorite vase.

31:43.300 --> 31:44.800
It was a family heirloom.

31:44.900 --> 31:47.000
Do you know
what heirloom means?

31:47.100 --> 31:49.300
Easily breakable?

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
Dad, you're a surgeon.
Why can't you operate on it?

31:55.100 --> 31:57.400
Wish i could, billy,
but i'm afraid in this case,

31:57.500 --> 31:59.600
The patient's never gonna recover.

31:59.700 --> 32:02.200
You all know the rules
about running in the house.

32:02.300 --> 32:03.700
We need to know
what happened here.

32:03.800 --> 32:06.000
Which one of you
broke the vase?

32:07.000 --> 32:10.200
Danny, do you have
something to say?

32:10.700 --> 32:12.000
Maybe it was a ghost.

32:12.100 --> 32:14.500
I always felt
this living room was haunted.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.800
The window was open.
Maybe a raccoon came in.

32:18.200 --> 32:21.200
I don't think it was a raccoon.
It's not a ghost.

32:21.300 --> 32:24.800
I think the culprit is
in this room right now.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.700
Why are you always accusing us?

32:26.800 --> 32:28.500
Why don't you ever
get mad at adrian?

32:28.600 --> 32:31.000
Yeah, you never
even suspect him.

32:31.100 --> 32:32.500
Adrian never gets in trouble.

32:32.600 --> 32:36.600
Adrian is perfect.
Adrian, adrian, adrian.

33:12.700 --> 33:14.300
Hey, mom. Hey, dad.

33:14.400 --> 33:17.600
Hey, danny. Hey, cathy.
Hey, billy. Hey, janey.

33:17.700 --> 33:18.800
Sorry i'm late.

33:18.900 --> 33:21.400
I was busy at school
because i'm so popular.

33:21.500 --> 33:24.900
Oh, guess what.
I made the football team.

33:26.200 --> 33:27.600
And guess what else.

33:27.700 --> 33:30.600
I'm the quarterback,
the popular star quarterback.

33:30.700 --> 33:34.000
And nobody makes fun of me
because i'm so popular.

33:34.100 --> 33:35.500
That's wonderful, adrian.

33:35.600 --> 33:37.400
Just don't throw
the ball around the house.

33:37.500 --> 33:39.200
- Oops.
- Why not?

33:39.300 --> 33:41.600
The vase is already broken.

33:44.200 --> 33:45.600
I'm so proud of you, son.

33:45.700 --> 33:47.300
Thanks for being
such a wonderful boy.

33:47.400 --> 33:48.600
You're welcome, dad.

33:48.700 --> 33:55.600
And thank you for never driving
away and leaving us forever.

33:57.300 --> 34:01.000
I would never do such a thing.
You don't have to worry about that.

34:24.199 --> 34:29.100
Cathy, is there anything
you'd like to say to mom and dad?

34:32.800 --> 34:35.600
Mom, dad,

34:36.000 --> 34:38.199
I have a confession.

34:39.199 --> 34:41.199
Scamp broke your vase.

34:41.400 --> 34:44.199
- Scamp?
- We didn't want to tell you.

34:44.300 --> 34:46.900
We were afraid you'd
send him back to the kennel.

34:48.800 --> 34:52.800
I understand why you did what you did,
but it's never right to lie.

34:52.900 --> 34:54.600
Sorry, dad.

34:54.699 --> 34:58.700
Cathy, is there anything else
you'd like to confess?

34:59.200 --> 35:01.400
I looked in janey's diary.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.400
No, no, you know
what i'm talking about.

35:05.900 --> 35:08.100
I'm talking about this.

35:08.400 --> 35:11.500
You mean, all the trophies
you won playing sports?

35:11.600 --> 35:15.200
Ha ha! No, not my trophies.

35:15.800 --> 35:19.300
I'm talking about her
silver globe award.

35:20.400 --> 35:23.100
You didn't really
earn this, did you?

35:23.500 --> 35:26.300
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Here's what happened.

35:26.500 --> 35:31.300
35 years ago, after this show was
cancelled, your career was in trouble.

35:31.400 --> 35:33.700
I'm not listening.
* la, la, la, la, la *

35:33.800 --> 35:38.000
And when you were nominated for this award,
you knew it was your last chance,

35:38.200 --> 35:41.400
And you would do
anything to win.

35:42.200 --> 35:45.200
You met a fan named
victor timlinson.

35:47.200 --> 35:49.000
He told you where he worked.

35:49.400 --> 35:52.500
It was the luckiest
break of your career.

35:52.900 --> 35:57.000
He worked for an accounting firm
called fineman and kelly.

35:57.100 --> 36:00.100
They tabulated the ballots for
all the big show business awards.

36:00.400 --> 36:02.700
Including...??

36:02.800 --> 36:08.000
He...???

36:08.400 --> 36:09.500
I don't know how you did it.

36:09.600 --> 36:12.000
Maybe you paid him off.
Maybe you flirted with him.

36:12.100 --> 36:16.000
But somehow you convinced him
to rig the final tally.

36:16.100 --> 36:19.200
Years went by. You probably figured
you'd never see him again.

36:19.300 --> 36:24.000
But when he read about your big
book deal, mr. Timlinson reappeared.

36:24.200 --> 36:25.900
He got greedy.

36:26.800 --> 36:28.700
He tried to shake you down.

36:28.800 --> 36:32.400
He threatened to tell the world
the truth about how you really won this.

36:32.500 --> 36:36.000
And you knew if you paid him,
he'd eventually want more.

36:36.100 --> 36:37.600
They always do.

36:37.700 --> 36:39.400
So you decided to kill him.

36:39.500 --> 36:41.600
- That's crazy talk.
- You set him up!

36:41.800 --> 36:45.700
You sent those letters to yourself.
You even blew up your own car.

36:45.900 --> 36:49.200
On monday night, you arranged
to meet him at that motel.

36:49.300 --> 36:53.200
??

36:58.100 --> 36:59.300
You shot him.

36:59.400 --> 37:02.900
You planted that knife in his hand
and those letters in his coat.

37:03.100 --> 37:07.600
Cathy, we've talked about this.
Killing people is never the answer.

37:07.700 --> 37:09.700
I'm afraid you're grounded,
young lady.

37:09.800 --> 37:12.600
It's not fair.
He doesn't have any proof.

37:12.900 --> 37:14.800
The d.A. Is gonna laugh you
out of his office.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.700
I don't think so.

37:18.000 --> 37:23.100
'Cause i found this in timlinson's
apartment in a hollowed-Out book.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.300
The original ballots.

37:25.800 --> 37:29.300
Timlinson must have kept
a couple as an insurance policy.

37:30.600 --> 37:35.200
- I'm very disappointed in you, cathy.
- It's not just cathy! This whole family is wacko.

37:35.300 --> 37:36.500
It's all in her book.

37:36.600 --> 37:38.200
You know where she is now?

37:38.300 --> 37:41.200
She's in miami dancing
in a strip club.

37:41.600 --> 37:44.800
What choice do i have?
I have a baby to feed.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.500
Danny didn't send me
any child support.

37:47.700 --> 37:49.300
I haven't seen a nickel.

37:49.400 --> 37:52.200
Yeah, well, how do i know the kid's
even mine, huh, janey?

37:53.900 --> 37:56.300
- What about me?
- You got hooked on crystal meth.

37:56.400 --> 37:58.400
This was the last job
you ever had.

37:58.600 --> 38:01.000
Oh, shucky darns.

38:03.100 --> 38:04.400
Do you hear that?

38:04.800 --> 38:06.700
What are they laughing at?

38:07.400 --> 38:09.000
What are you--

38:09.200 --> 38:13.100
- Mr. Monk, help me.
- I'm not finished yet.

38:13.200 --> 38:15.900
Mr. Monk, help me, please.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.700
Mr. Monk, help me.

38:18.500 --> 38:20.200
Help me, please.

38:26.500 --> 38:28.200
Mr. Monk, help me.

38:41.100 --> 38:42.700
Mr. Monk.

38:49.300 --> 38:50.700
Get back!

38:50.900 --> 38:52.200
Get back.

38:54.500 --> 38:56.300
Don't move. Stay there.

38:56.400 --> 38:59.100
Stay down, and just
stay right there.

39:00.900 --> 39:03.900
You're in big, big trouble,
young lady.

39:04.300 --> 39:06.900
That was from episode five,
season two,

39:07.100 --> 39:09.500
"Grounded for life."

39:11.300 --> 39:13.400
??

39:24.500 --> 39:28.300
- Can i help you?
- Yes. I would like to return this.

39:28.400 --> 39:31.200
- Oh, i'm sorry. Was there a problem?
- Yes, there was a problem.

39:31.300 --> 39:32.600
She's a whore.

39:32.700 --> 39:35.600
- And she killed someone.
- That too.

39:36.500 --> 39:38.600
- I'm sorry you're disappointed.

39:41.700 --> 39:43.200
Here you go.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.500
Anything else?

39:54.800 --> 39:55.900
Yeah, it's hardly
worth mentioning.

39:56.000 --> 39:59.300
Do you remember when i said you
could keep the change?

40:01.600 --> 40:03.200
How much was it?

40:03.700 --> 40:06.100
12 cents.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.500
Okay.

40:16.300 --> 40:18.000
Excuse me.

40:18.800 --> 40:20.400
Is there a problem?

40:20.900 --> 40:23.100
This page is from a different book.
It's been taped in.

40:23.200 --> 40:25.100
Ha. I don't think so.

"Oliver was told that he might do
what he like with his old clothes.

40:27.700 --> 40:29.400
He gave them to a servant
who'd been kind to him."

40:29.500 --> 40:30.800
This is from oliver twist.

40:30.900 --> 40:33.300
I told you. I'm sorry,
i tried to tell him.

40:33.400 --> 40:35.100

40:35.200 --> 40:41.500

page in there, a different page.

40:42.200 --> 40:45.200

- Actually, i improved the book.

40:45.300 --> 40:47.500
That's charles dickens.
It's a classic.

40:47.600 --> 40:50.100
I don't understand.
Why would you do this?

40:51.300 --> 40:54.400
I believe the sign says,
"no questions."

40:56.800 --> 40:58.100
Sorry.

41:06.300 --> 41:07.400

41:25.300 --> 41:28.200
Well, i can't just say something
funny off the top of my head.

41:28.300 --> 41:31.200
