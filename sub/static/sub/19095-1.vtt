00:37.665 --> 00:39.051
Okay, how about now?

00:39.119 --> 00:40.486
Yeah, I can feel it.

00:40.564 --> 00:42.009
But there's a little delay.

00:42.169 --> 00:43.525
Hmm.

00:44.540 --> 00:46.196
How about now?

00:46.376 --> 00:48.204
Now I felt it
<i>before</i> you hit me.

00:48.329 --> 00:49.392
Whoa! Really?!

00:49.525 --> 00:50.751
Ha ha!
Just kidding!

00:50.837 --> 00:52.275
It's fine.
It's fine.

00:52.462 --> 00:54.267
Come on, now.
This is serious.

00:54.335 --> 00:55.923
And expensive.

00:56.087 --> 00:57.371
I've been working
on this new arm

00:57.439 --> 00:58.832
since the last time
this happened,

00:58.900 --> 01:01.603
so please don't blow it up
so fast this time.

01:01.720 --> 01:03.158
We'll see.

01:03.423 --> 01:04.430
Honestly, though,

01:04.498 --> 01:05.988
this doesn't even feel
that weird now.

01:06.056 --> 01:07.821
I mean, maybe it's 'cause
it already happened

01:07.889 --> 01:09.673
once before,
but, I don't know.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.517
It feels like normal,
I guess.

01:12.884 --> 01:14.759
I mean, I know
it's "serious."

01:14.845 --> 01:16.220
Jake and
Susan and Rattleballs

01:16.288 --> 01:17.611
all got
pretty banged up.

01:17.759 --> 01:19.579
But for me,
I guess it's like...

01:19.743 --> 01:21.845
I don't know.
It feels right or something.

01:22.517 --> 01:24.915
What's weird, though,
is that grass guy.

01:25.111 --> 01:27.167
Kinda rubs me
the wrong way, that one.

01:27.254 --> 01:30.152
Yes... the mysterious
grass guy.

01:30.259 --> 01:31.480
Tell me again
what happened

01:31.548 --> 01:33.540
with the two of you
this morning.

01:36.311 --> 01:38.650
Okay, so,
as you know...

01:38.845 --> 01:41.515
after Susan had gone crazy
and kicked Jake's butt,

01:41.602 --> 01:44.232
my grass arm got steamed
and kicked <i> her</i> butt.

01:44.423 --> 01:45.837
Then it ran off
and merged butts

01:45.905 --> 01:47.243
with my Finn Sword...

01:47.795 --> 01:49.122
and turned
into <i> this</i> guy,

01:49.256 --> 01:51.123
and he starts
talking smack!

01:51.311 --> 01:54.131
Mah! Maaaaah!

01:54.450 --> 01:55.584
What?!

01:56.098 --> 01:58.201
Mah! Mah!

01:58.280 --> 01:59.811
Hey, man,
you stay back!

01:59.898 --> 02:01.563
Eeyuh!
Muh eeyuh!

02:01.631 --> 02:02.735
- Muh eeyuh!
- Hey!

02:02.803 --> 02:04.506
I-I said
stay back, man!

02:04.607 --> 02:06.537
I seen what you did
to Susan!

02:08.639 --> 02:13.081
Susan's... cells...
are on fire.

02:13.340 --> 02:15.358
Susah!
Susah?!

02:15.504 --> 02:16.521
Hey!

02:17.256 --> 02:18.311
Stop!

02:22.388 --> 02:24.244
- You leave her alone, you weirdo!
- You leave her alone, you weirdo!

02:24.311 --> 02:25.911
- Susan's my friend!
- Susan's my friend!

02:26.005 --> 02:27.060
Fruh...

02:27.155 --> 02:28.165
freh...

02:28.233 --> 02:29.297
Friend.

02:29.365 --> 02:30.459
What?!

02:30.943 --> 02:32.014
Huh?

02:32.217 --> 02:34.373
I said, "What?"
What did <i> you</i> say?

02:34.529 --> 02:35.504
"Whu?"

02:35.577 --> 02:36.881
Oh. Okay.

02:37.061 --> 02:39.178
My ears weren't working
before, for some reason.

02:39.263 --> 02:40.436
Or my mouth.

02:40.678 --> 02:41.969
Sorry about that.

02:42.131 --> 02:44.639
Also, why are you
dressed like me?

02:44.742 --> 02:45.928
Get a life, man.

02:46.008 --> 02:47.030
What?!

02:47.098 --> 02:49.209
You're dressed like <i> me,</i>
man! Geez!

02:49.441 --> 02:52.391
Anyway, you just keep your hands
off of Susan, guy.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.256
Susan?
Can you hear me?

02:54.324 --> 02:55.420
It's Finn.

02:55.545 --> 02:56.819
Susan?

02:56.916 --> 02:58.412
Owwww!

02:58.660 --> 03:00.256
No touch.

03:00.592 --> 03:02.069
Oh. Sorry.

03:02.436 --> 03:04.913
You keep
your hands off of my friend!

03:05.015 --> 03:06.154
What are you on abou...

03:06.233 --> 03:07.600
Aaah! Whoa!

03:07.668 --> 03:08.712
Oof!

03:08.780 --> 03:10.256
Don't worry, Susan!

03:13.178 --> 03:15.905
All right, all right! Enough!
Truce, truce!

03:18.139 --> 03:20.717
Sorry, Dawg, but I can't
let you hurt Susan.

03:21.576 --> 03:23.139
I wasn't gonna
hurt her!

03:23.233 --> 03:25.326
I was protecting her
from <i> you!</i>

03:25.748 --> 03:28.264
Me? But...
I'm Finn Mertens, man.

03:28.475 --> 03:31.108
I'm 100% hero.
Everyone knows that.

03:31.303 --> 03:33.444
What?!
I'm <i> Finn</i> Mertens!

03:33.662 --> 03:34.686
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

03:34.754 --> 03:35.830
Sorry, man.

03:35.898 --> 03:38.198
I mean, I'm flattered,
but... come on.

03:38.285 --> 03:39.714
No,<i> you</i> come on!

03:39.801 --> 03:40.873
Finn!

03:40.997 --> 03:42.826
Hold on, buddy!
I'm coming!

03:46.639 --> 03:49.069
Jake! Boy, am I glad
to see you!

03:49.147 --> 03:51.186
This bozo keeps saying
he's me.

03:51.334 --> 03:52.470
Why don't you
set him straight

03:52.537 --> 03:54.498
and tell him
who the <i> real</i> Finn is.

03:54.694 --> 03:55.830
That one.

03:56.123 --> 03:57.240
What?

03:57.326 --> 03:59.335
Yeah, I don't know
what <i> you</i> are.

03:59.403 --> 04:01.855
Some kind of
demon-plant thing, probably.

04:01.923 --> 04:02.938
But I...

04:03.006 --> 04:04.490
Beating up
on my poor brother

04:04.600 --> 04:06.006
like some kind of demon!

04:06.170 --> 04:07.256
Yeah!

04:07.529 --> 04:09.296
Show us your true form,
demon!

04:09.383 --> 04:10.530
Yeah, show us!

04:10.617 --> 04:12.566
- Show us! Show us!
- Show us! Show us!

04:12.653 --> 04:14.467
Show us! Show us!

04:14.535 --> 04:16.748
Show us! Show us!

04:18.975 --> 04:20.076
Oof!

04:20.170 --> 04:21.408
Whoa!

04:24.716 --> 04:26.613
Yeah, it's a real mess
out here.

04:26.707 --> 04:29.231
We're gonna need
the <i> huge</i> ambulance.

04:29.559 --> 04:30.833
Yeah, no.

04:30.905 --> 04:31.989
No.

04:32.120 --> 04:33.723
No, the huge...

04:33.959 --> 04:35.140
No.

04:35.457 --> 04:36.723
No.

04:36.791 --> 04:37.819
No.

04:37.887 --> 04:40.598
Put Banana Guard number 2
on the phone.

04:41.016 --> 04:42.178
Well, go get him!

04:42.246 --> 04:43.546
All right, all right.

04:43.684 --> 04:46.856
I think I've heard
just about enoughhhhh...

04:47.802 --> 04:50.337
to know that I need
to hear that all over again.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.356
Why don't you
take it from the top?

04:52.919 --> 04:55.333
Okay, so,
as you know...

04:56.756 --> 05:00.302
♪♪

05:09.536 --> 05:10.926
Hey, BMO.

05:16.599 --> 05:17.724
BMO?

05:18.946 --> 05:21.044
Oh, hey!
My nose is back.

05:22.517 --> 05:24.482
Mmm!
Stinks good in here.

05:25.179 --> 05:26.645
It's got
that "big boy" musk.

05:26.756 --> 05:29.724
Socks, trash, butt...
All the stinks of home.

05:29.880 --> 05:31.880
Ha!
Hey, what are you doing?

05:32.152 --> 05:33.911
Get out of here!
Ha!

05:34.943 --> 05:36.638
Man, I remember that day.

05:38.482 --> 05:40.966
That was when BMO
lost control of the tank.

05:43.651 --> 05:44.899
Oh.

05:45.135 --> 05:46.654
Mm-hmm.

05:46.792 --> 05:47.873
Ha!

05:48.054 --> 05:49.411
Aw.

05:59.168 --> 06:01.091
Hey! Give me that!

06:05.530 --> 06:07.053
What the crease?!

06:07.303 --> 06:08.836
You gonna get it now,
dude!

06:08.904 --> 06:10.662
That's the Grass Sword!

06:10.963 --> 06:12.147
Hyah!

06:13.709 --> 06:14.774
What the hey?

06:14.884 --> 06:16.132
Oh, no.

06:16.274 --> 06:18.498
No, no, no.

06:20.299 --> 06:21.623
I hate this.

06:21.810 --> 06:23.330
I liked it before.

06:29.985 --> 06:30.985
Who are you?

06:31.181 --> 06:33.752
Oh, you know...
A curse.

06:33.974 --> 06:36.416
An emissary from beyond.

06:37.236 --> 06:39.494
Some kind
of grass octopus spider.

06:39.619 --> 06:41.679
Aah! Grass Demon!

06:41.986 --> 06:43.583
You're making me nervous,
dude.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.533
No!
No, no, no!

06:45.620 --> 06:47.090
Don't worry
about me.

06:47.158 --> 06:48.722
I <i> am</i> worrying about you!

06:48.809 --> 06:50.666
Dude, stop this!

06:50.822 --> 06:53.111
It's okay. I just
gotta do something here.

06:53.242 --> 06:54.316
One sec.

06:54.384 --> 06:57.097
Okay, just one more
second.

07:04.626 --> 07:06.447
So, how are <i> you</i> today?

07:06.657 --> 07:07.788
I'm good.

07:07.955 --> 07:09.283
I want out of here,
though.

07:09.384 --> 07:11.717
I've pretty much done
all I can do in here.

07:11.906 --> 07:15.345
You and me, we could do
a lot better out <i> there.</i>

07:15.767 --> 07:17.142
I want out, too.

07:17.400 --> 07:18.658
Let's do it.

07:18.791 --> 07:22.522
Wait... do you mean out of the
sword or out of the cocoon?

07:24.588 --> 07:27.042
Okay. I get it.

07:27.213 --> 07:30.455
When we get out of here,
let <i> me</i> do the talking.

07:36.892 --> 07:39.639
And then <i> you</i> asked me
to take it from the top.

07:39.830 --> 07:42.431
So...
that guy is definitely

07:42.517 --> 07:45.211
an alternate-reality
evil doppelganger, right?

07:45.298 --> 07:46.479
Huh.

07:46.566 --> 07:47.744
No.

07:47.845 --> 07:50.784
He's not even
from a different timeline.

07:50.886 --> 07:52.595
Finn, he's just you.

07:52.783 --> 07:54.767
Yeah, you say that,
but <i> I'm</i> me.

07:54.859 --> 07:56.650
So he's...

07:58.423 --> 07:59.504
BMO?

07:59.572 --> 08:01.098
News flash, hotshot...

08:01.166 --> 08:03.332
You're in the house,
and you're made out of grass,

08:03.400 --> 08:05.916
and you're breaking my china,
and I'm scared!

08:05.984 --> 08:07.142
What?!

08:07.423 --> 08:09.525
This grass guy's
scaring BMO!

08:09.593 --> 08:10.941
Let's get him!

08:11.014 --> 08:12.658
Waaaaaaaaah!

08:16.356 --> 08:18.173
I've got a crush
on Jake.

08:23.151 --> 08:25.111
Oh, no, no, no.

08:25.197 --> 08:28.994
I... can't... get...
anything right!

08:36.635 --> 08:37.770
Hey, weedy!

08:37.876 --> 08:38.909
Hey.

08:38.977 --> 08:41.267
Just let me suck around
a bit, okay, man?

08:41.361 --> 08:42.705
No way, buster!

08:42.806 --> 08:44.337
You're hurting BMO!

08:44.470 --> 08:45.553
I'm okay!

08:45.775 --> 08:48.494
Geeeeeeet outta here!

08:48.579 --> 08:49.660
Come on, Finn!

08:49.728 --> 08:52.560
Jake, uh, I'm still
processing all this.

08:52.647 --> 08:53.880
United front!

08:54.021 --> 08:55.298
Okay.

08:57.358 --> 08:58.696
You scare BMO,

08:58.806 --> 09:00.720
you muck up
my mom's records,

09:00.807 --> 09:02.603
you waste my br...

09:03.220 --> 09:05.118
You waste
my breakfast syr...

09:05.506 --> 09:06.696
Breakfast syrup!

09:06.797 --> 09:07.852
Hey!

09:07.993 --> 09:10.212
Look at me
when I'm mad!

09:10.931 --> 09:13.228
Look at my eyes!
They're mad!

09:13.353 --> 09:14.701
And they have to look
in your...

09:14.788 --> 09:17.189
Hey! They have to look
in <i> your</i> eyes!

09:17.305 --> 09:19.774
Take my anger
into your face!

09:19.993 --> 09:21.122
You're a fraud!

09:21.209 --> 09:22.991
You think
you can fake Jake?

09:23.157 --> 09:24.470
You can't fake Jake!

09:24.540 --> 09:27.981
Cake, rake, lake,
hamburger steak!

09:28.126 --> 09:29.415
Oh, man!

09:31.219 --> 09:32.532
Oh!

09:37.711 --> 09:39.290
You're a chum-bait!

09:39.421 --> 09:40.446
Jake, no!

09:40.595 --> 09:42.204
It's for fishing, BMO!

09:42.298 --> 09:43.963
It's something
that fishermen use!

09:44.050 --> 09:46.407
And he <i> is</i> one!
He's a chum-bait!

09:46.475 --> 09:47.722
Hey!

09:50.446 --> 09:53.006
Grass-me, do <i> you</i> want
a Finn cake?

09:53.329 --> 09:54.439
But...

09:54.603 --> 09:56.470
only Finns
get Finn cakes.

09:56.548 --> 09:58.220
That's true.

10:01.717 --> 10:02.845
Wait.

10:08.642 --> 10:12.774
That's that good sugary trash,
like a big boy likes.

Grass Finn's loco?

10:40.032 --> 10:41.204
I think he'll be okay.

10:41.314 --> 10:44.446

17:26.028 --> 17:28.112

17:48.336 --> 17:51.456

"What squats
on stony feet"...

18:02.440 --> 18:03.654

18:03.807 --> 18:05.487

Why did you make me?

19:05.961 --> 19:07.044
Am I bad?

19:07.112 --> 19:08.466
Am I part

19:08.534 --> 19:10.030
hatched by
one of Finn's enemies?

19:10.117 --> 19:12.877
Or am I an eternal curse

19:14.571 --> 19:16.487
No, nothing like that.

19:16.581 --> 19:18.505
I just thought
it would be cool.

19:18.612 --> 19:22.018
"Grass blade"...
It's a sort of pun.

19:22.315 --> 19:24.552
Actually, this is great
for me, personally.

19:24.632 --> 19:28.463
Since you're <i>my</i> creation,
you have to do what I say!

19:28.629 --> 19:31.229
Chop up
this trespassing dog!

19:35.424 --> 19:37.073

19:37.141 --> 19:38.207
Ooh!

19:38.331 --> 19:39.940
Obey m... Oof!

19:40.011 --> 19:42.096
Okay, maybe just leave...
Ugh!

19:42.801 --> 19:45.370
Hey, buddy,
that's... that's plenty.

19:45.519 --> 19:47.134
Fight the evil, right?

19:47.416 --> 19:49.456
Yeah...
but not like that.

19:49.541 --> 19:50.692
It ain't right.

19:50.838 --> 19:53.174
Not ri... right?

19:55.846 --> 19:57.344
Right here in my hand...

19:57.510 --> 19:59.528
I hold
the latest miracle cure.

19:59.615 --> 20:01.463
Once I release
this surgical sword,

20:01.550 --> 20:03.532
Susan's warrior instincts
will kick in

20:03.619 --> 20:05.713
and she'll snap back
to consciousness.

20:06.010 --> 20:07.268
Any questions?

20:08.057 --> 20:09.538
No, let's see
where this goes.

20:09.625 --> 20:10.870
I want to see brains.

20:10.995 --> 20:12.393
All right.

20:14.042 --> 20:15.630
Hey, y'all.
I'm back.

20:15.698 --> 20:17.002
What?!

20:17.900 --> 20:19.088
A sword?!

20:19.268 --> 20:21.135
That's not
how you practice medicine!

20:21.206 --> 20:23.003
Don't listen to her, Doc.
You're great!

20:23.090 --> 20:24.687
You fixed me up
tip-top.

20:24.774 --> 20:27.385
Jibbs! Did your hand
<i>always</i> look like that?!

20:27.548 --> 20:29.517
Well...
I guess maybe not.

20:29.721 --> 20:31.034
But I trust you.

20:31.276 --> 20:34.081
Yo, yo, yo, Mr. Fox!

20:34.383 --> 20:35.971
Aagh! My back!

20:36.178 --> 20:37.862
I'm no doctor.

20:38.157 --> 20:41.198
That felt kind of right
for a while. But nah.

20:41.333 --> 20:43.693
They would've been better off
if I had just stayed out of it.

20:43.760 --> 20:46.838
Uh, yeah,
speaking of that...

20:47.495 --> 20:49.029
Banana guards,
prep the garden shed.

20:49.097 --> 20:51.479

of fertilizer, stat!

20:52.268 --> 20:53.432
See, Grass Finn?

20:53.549 --> 20:55.823
In the end,
you did the right thing...

20:55.995 --> 20:57.643
Just like Finn would have.

20:58.160 --> 21:00.308
Uh...
good job, grass me.

21:00.534 --> 21:01.995
But I'm <i>not</i> you.

21:02.192 --> 21:04.358

Fern needs this bike.

Hey, Fern, wait!

21:24.300 --> 21:25.466
Let him go, man.

21:25.534 --> 21:26.823
Trust me.

21:41.151 --> 21:42.690
Awesome!
