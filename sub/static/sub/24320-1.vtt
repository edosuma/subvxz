00:09.545 --> 00:12.490
You ready?

00:12.492 --> 00:13.873
No.

00:13.875 --> 00:15.878
Come on this was always our plan!

00:15.880 --> 00:18.397
I know but I'm scared,
we've just arrived!

00:18.399 --> 00:20.790
Yeah but that's the point,
first thing after we arrive...

00:20.792 --> 00:23.045
We get rid of them, I know, I know!

00:23.047 --> 00:24.464
So let's do it.

00:25.600 --> 00:27.090
I just want to do one more thing.

00:27.092 --> 00:28.323
You know the um, the email

00:28.325 --> 00:30.501
- No, no I don't know the
- the one that...

00:30.503 --> 00:31.726
email, I don't know the email!

00:31.826 --> 00:33.797
Look, look, I'm gonna
count to three.

00:33.897 --> 00:35.147
Okay.

00:35.223 --> 00:36.995
One, two...

00:36.997 --> 00:38.373
Three!

00:39.840 --> 00:42.114
What are you, what are
you doing, now you've...

00:42.116 --> 00:43.435
I didn't think you were gonna...

00:43.535 --> 00:45.377
I figured you'd wait
till I counted to three!

00:45.379 --> 00:46.480
It doesn't matter!

00:46.482 --> 00:48.178
It kind of matters, 'cause I thought we

00:48.180 --> 00:49.566
were doing it together, but...

00:49.666 --> 00:50.838
You took your time,

00:50.938 --> 00:52.871
- I sensed a magical moment,
- Well I just, well I

00:52.971 --> 00:54.432
- So...
- counted to three, it's,

00:54.434 --> 00:55.941
it's not even a big number, I'm just,

00:56.041 --> 00:57.439
- I'm just gonna throw it.
- Okay.

00:57.441 --> 00:58.947
Mine went further!

00:58.949 --> 01:00.326
I don't think it did.

01:00.426 --> 01:01.750
I don't think it did actually.

01:01.850 --> 01:02.950
Come on, it felt amazing!

01:02.952 --> 01:04.410
- Yeah...
- A lot better than I even

01:04.510 --> 01:05.566
- expected!
- Would have been

01:05.568 --> 01:06.664
better if you waited.

01:06.666 --> 01:08.625
- Why are you ruining it?
- I'm not ruining it,

01:08.725 --> 01:11.014
if anyone ruined it, it was
you because you didn't wait.

01:11.114 --> 01:12.909
You took your time, we threw our phones,

01:13.009 --> 01:14.739
- it doesn't matter.
- It kind of matters,

01:14.741 --> 01:18.408
'cause you should have waited
for me to throw my phone.

Hi ya, give us a beer.

03:15.690 --> 03:18.023
What brings you to Sardinia?

03:20.630 --> 03:22.193
Habla Englaise?

03:22.195 --> 03:24.358
Speak Australian?

03:24.360 --> 03:25.920
Yeah.

03:25.922 --> 03:28.746
Great, what brings you to Sardinia?

03:28.748 --> 03:31.327
Nothing, nothing specific.

03:31.329 --> 03:33.489
Can't be nothing.

03:33.491 --> 03:34.708
Where you from?

03:34.710 --> 03:38.831
Doesn't matter.

03:38.833 --> 03:39.866
Why not?

03:41.323 --> 03:43.851
'Cause I'm not going back.

03:43.853 --> 03:45.529
Fair enough, I get that.

03:45.531 --> 03:48.109
I mean, I haven't been home in what,

03:48.111 --> 03:49.144
18 years?

03:50.894 --> 03:51.894
Name's Rick.

03:54.990 --> 03:56.215
Dave.

03:56.217 --> 03:57.384
- Dave?
- Yeah.

03:58.940 --> 04:00.360
All right.

04:00.362 --> 04:01.395
Dave.

04:04.416 --> 04:06.499
You want to hear a story?

04:08.143 --> 04:09.970
All right.

04:09.972 --> 04:12.632
See that girl over there?

04:12.634 --> 04:13.680
Brunette.

04:13.682 --> 04:14.765
Cracking ass.

04:16.332 --> 04:17.825
- Yeah.
- Well, I was talking

04:17.827 --> 04:20.028
to her before, and she's telling me,

04:20.029 --> 04:22.780
about how she went to this
bar yesterday afternoon.

04:22.782 --> 04:24.918
So,

04:24.920 --> 04:26.410
she's rushing up to this bar

04:26.412 --> 04:27.862
where she usually goes for a drink

04:27.864 --> 04:30.252
after finishing up one of her tours.

04:30.352 --> 04:32.418
She's a tour guide, for tourists, right?

04:36.806 --> 04:40.788
Oh crap, now I've forgotten something.

04:40.790 --> 04:43.763
Oh anyway, she's rushing up to this bar

04:43.765 --> 04:45.531
she usually goes to and she orders herself

04:45.533 --> 04:47.473
a nice cold Corona.

04:47.475 --> 04:48.620
She takes her Corona,

04:48.622 --> 04:50.619
and she goes to sit in her normal seat.

04:50.621 --> 04:53.634
Oh shit it was raining, right!

04:53.636 --> 04:55.495
So, she's at this bar

04:55.497 --> 04:56.816
on this rainy afternoon,

04:56.818 --> 04:58.769
and she's trying to
sit at her usual table.

04:58.771 --> 05:00.168
Somebody's already sitting there.

05:00.170 --> 05:02.792
Ah no, wait, it was two guys,

05:02.794 --> 05:04.528
and a chick.

05:04.530 --> 05:06.490
Now, it's kind of a shitty bar,

05:06.492 --> 05:08.530
and there's lots of other places to sit,

05:08.532 --> 05:10.553
but here's this tour guide who's wondering

05:10.555 --> 05:12.952
who might have stumbled on
her make-shift watering hole.

05:13.052 --> 05:17.219
So she sits at the next table,
she starts eavesdropping.

05:19.210 --> 05:21.728
Helena, that's her name.

05:21.730 --> 05:24.865
So there sits Helena,
listening in on what seems like

05:24.867 --> 05:27.658
run of the mill small talk, not realizing

05:27.660 --> 05:29.832
what she's about to witness.

05:29.834 --> 05:33.410
You see, this young couple
seemed suspiciously interested

05:33.412 --> 05:36.890
in what this washed up high
school teacher had to say.

05:36.892 --> 05:38.944
Didn't seem like they
knew each other too well,

05:38.946 --> 05:40.519
but for some reason he seemed to take

05:40.521 --> 05:42.936
a liking in the little scamps.

05:42.938 --> 05:45.160
So he leans over and he says,

05:45.162 --> 05:48.174
"So you want to know about
Francesco something or other?"

05:48.176 --> 05:49.991
Oh I don't know, I forget his name.

05:49.993 --> 05:52.719
- Francesco Rodriguez.
- That's right.

05:52.721 --> 05:54.847
Francesco Rodriguez.

05:54.849 --> 05:57.853
Now, to the average Joe,
that isn't intriguing.

05:57.855 --> 05:58.872
But Helena,

05:58.874 --> 06:00.464
being the history infatuated

06:00.466 --> 06:02.085
tour guide that she is, knows that he's

06:02.087 --> 06:04.946
talking about Francesco
Rodriguez Figueroa,

06:04.948 --> 06:08.439
son of Rodrigo Figueroa,
famous Spanish seafarer,

06:08.441 --> 06:09.912
and husband to the

06:09.914 --> 06:12.800
Italian beauty Angela Figueroa.

06:12.802 --> 06:15.025
But why the fuck is any of this relevant?

06:15.027 --> 06:18.389
Well it turns out, in the mid-17th century

06:18.391 --> 06:20.885
Francesco's father, Rodrigo, was charged

06:20.887 --> 06:24.627
by a wealthy Spanish nobleman
to send a substantial dowry

06:24.629 --> 06:26.185
from Spain across the

06:26.187 --> 06:28.378
Mediterranean to Rome.

06:28.380 --> 06:30.462
Now, being in high demand,

06:30.464 --> 06:32.717
Rodrigo didn't see much of his son.

06:32.719 --> 06:34.403
But this journey was different.

06:34.405 --> 06:36.374
You see, Francesco had just come of age,

06:36.376 --> 06:38.801
and after days of pestering his father,

06:38.803 --> 06:41.076
Rodrigo decided to bring him along.

06:41.078 --> 06:42.411
So off they sailed on

06:42.413 --> 06:44.869
the Espadrillo.

06:44.871 --> 06:48.538
Now this is where the story
takes a bit of a turn.

06:48.540 --> 06:49.981
Because you see the Espadrillo

06:49.983 --> 06:52.316
never actually arrived in Rome.

06:52.318 --> 06:53.994
- So where is it?
- Well the shipwreck

06:53.996 --> 06:55.782
was found many years later, right here

06:55.784 --> 06:57.753
by a promontory in southern Sardinia.

06:57.755 --> 06:59.518
Yeah but what about the dowry?

06:59.520 --> 07:01.255
When the wreckage was found there was

07:01.257 --> 07:02.871
no sign of the dowry, and unfortunately,

07:02.873 --> 07:05.503
all the crew were found
dead, save for one.

07:05.505 --> 07:08.329
Francesco Rodriguez Figueroa.

07:08.331 --> 07:11.835
Francesco Rodriguez Figueroa!

07:11.837 --> 07:14.558
Francesco Rodriguez Figorelli!

07:14.560 --> 07:15.745
- Figueroa.
- Right.

07:15.747 --> 07:18.427
- Figueroa.
- So, it's a treasure hunt.

07:18.429 --> 07:21.773
Well no not exactly, you
see there were no clues.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.753
The only bread crumb Francesco left behind

07:23.755 --> 07:26.425
was the message on the
inside of the Espadrillo.

07:26.427 --> 07:28.668
Carved into the bulkhead
of the ship Francesco wrote

07:31.924 --> 07:35.174
Now, isn't that an interesting story?

07:39.733 --> 07:42.804
What line of work you in, Rick?

07:42.806 --> 07:45.029
Don't suppose you'd
believe I was a historian?

07:45.031 --> 07:48.554
A historian that can't
remember Francesco's name?

07:48.556 --> 07:50.192
Fair enough, you got me there.

07:50.194 --> 07:52.738
So you're a treasure hunter.

07:52.740 --> 07:54.823
Well, it's a great story.

07:56.676 --> 07:58.470
But I don't see your point.

07:58.472 --> 08:01.213
Look, Dave, I get it.

08:01.215 --> 08:04.537
An adventure's only as good as
the people you share it with.

08:04.539 --> 08:06.543
But I've been in this
business long enough to know

08:06.545 --> 08:08.331
that there's always a
few more pairs of ears

08:08.333 --> 08:09.704
listening in than you might like.

08:09.706 --> 08:11.706
So what you're concerned?

08:11.708 --> 08:13.578
Well, what are you doing talking to

08:13.580 --> 08:16.077
a bunch of kids about this?

08:45.498 --> 08:49.081
That's right sir,
the bus leaves at 8:30.

08:54.348 --> 08:55.918
I understand that but there's not much

08:55.920 --> 08:57.809
that can be done, the timetable's fixed

08:57.811 --> 09:00.061
so we don't miss the ferry.

09:05.320 --> 09:08.820
Sorry, I'm driving through a tunnel, so...

09:16.703 --> 09:17.759
Cash!

09:17.761 --> 09:19.457
No, it's just, you know, it's a shame.

09:19.459 --> 09:21.437
Stop it, that's enough now.

09:21.439 --> 09:23.329
Still a shame, I just
wish we did it together.

09:23.429 --> 09:24.631
Oh my god are you hungry?

09:24.633 --> 09:26.032
- I'm hungry.
- I want this one,

09:26.034 --> 09:27.220
is it chocolate or something?

09:27.222 --> 09:29.337
- Maybe.
- What are you getting at?

09:29.339 --> 09:31.172
I don't know.

09:34.034 --> 09:36.427
Would you like
a drink or something?

09:39.744 --> 09:41.994
Well I'm gonna get
one, what are you gonna get?

09:41.996 --> 09:43.411
I'm gonna get the juice.

09:43.413 --> 09:45.277
Juice, what are you
getting juice for, when...

09:45.279 --> 09:46.529
I like juice.

09:47.570 --> 09:50.403
- Did you just see that?
- Hmm?

09:50.405 --> 09:51.901
He's just taken that guy's phone!

09:51.903 --> 09:54.025
- He take that guy's phone?
- The guy who was there,

09:54.027 --> 09:55.841
- he took his phone!
- Well let's go and get it,

09:55.843 --> 09:57.642
let's go and get the
phone, we'll bring it to,

09:57.644 --> 09:59.220
- we'll bring it.
- Are we following him?

09:59.320 --> 10:00.876
We're definitely going,

10:00.878 --> 10:03.305
- Okay, okay!
- We need to follow the guy.

10:03.307 --> 10:05.060
Come on.

11:10.157 --> 11:11.190
What?

11:14.290 --> 11:16.528
We saw you steal that
guys phone back at the bar.

11:16.530 --> 11:18.344
So what, you
gonna call the police?

11:18.346 --> 11:20.674
Ooh, call the police, not
really our style actually.

11:20.676 --> 11:22.166
- Fuck the police!
- Fuck 'em!

11:22.168 --> 11:23.201
Great.

11:24.579 --> 11:26.937
It's, it's just weird.

11:26.939 --> 11:29.049
What is?

11:29.051 --> 11:31.913
I mean, why's a guy like
you need to steal a phone?

11:31.915 --> 11:33.753
You know it's not like
you couldn't afford one,

11:33.755 --> 11:34.758
especially out here.

11:34.858 --> 11:35.891
What do you mean?

11:36.091 --> 11:38.331
Well you've got
the five euro H and M shirt.

11:38.333 --> 11:39.364
- Yeah.
- And the 10 euro

11:39.366 --> 11:40.766
- mango pants.
- 10.

11:40.768 --> 11:42.528
But this right there is a Sartino watch.

11:42.628 --> 11:45.044
- That's a watch.
- Easy 400 euros.

11:45.046 --> 11:49.159
Ray Bans, 200 euros, and a
Hugo Boss wallet, 80 euros.

11:49.161 --> 11:50.375
You're not fooling anyone.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.993
Yeah well maybe I stole them too.

11:51.995 --> 11:53.432
You did not want

11:53.434 --> 11:54.940
to steal that phone!

11:54.942 --> 11:56.842
Eh, what are you, Sherlock and Watson?

11:56.844 --> 11:59.344
More like, Bonnie and Clyde.

12:00.801 --> 12:03.149
- Give me back my wallet!
- Why'd you steal the phone?

12:03.151 --> 12:05.192
Here, take it, it doesn't work anyway,

12:05.194 --> 12:07.333
I don't have the PIN.

12:07.335 --> 12:08.833
Well now it's not gonna work is it.

12:08.835 --> 12:10.922
- Yep, definitely not.
- Now give me back my wallet!

12:11.022 --> 12:12.105
No!

12:13.033 --> 12:14.366
Fine, keep it!

12:16.053 --> 12:17.970
Well what about this?

12:24.559 --> 12:25.938
What do you want?

12:25.940 --> 12:27.708
What does anyone want?

12:27.710 --> 12:28.785
Adventure!

12:28.787 --> 12:30.582
Tough luck, there's none to be had here.

12:30.584 --> 12:34.751
Okay,.

12:38.603 --> 12:40.103
All right, stop.

12:42.576 --> 12:45.215
Are you guys really looking for adventure?

12:45.217 --> 12:46.250
Please?

12:49.533 --> 12:51.250
All right, follow me.

12:55.672 --> 12:57.754
- Where are we going?
- To get a beer.

12:57.756 --> 13:00.202
Nice.

13:00.204 --> 13:03.207
Oh, by the way in your
wallet, I didn't see any ID.

13:03.209 --> 13:05.188
I'm Sarah and this is Cash.

13:05.190 --> 13:06.357
Sarah, Cash.

13:08.969 --> 13:11.336
All right. I'm Dave.

13:11.338 --> 13:12.398
Hey.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.736
- Dave.
- Yep.

13:13.738 --> 13:18.346
I think we're
gonna have a great day.

13:18.348 --> 13:19.751
Well what are you doing talking

13:19.851 --> 13:21.255
to a bunch of kids about this?

13:21.257 --> 13:24.018
To be honest I didn't really
have much of a choice there.

13:24.020 --> 13:26.282
Kind of like now, talking to you.

13:26.284 --> 13:29.071
Ah, right, the.

13:29.073 --> 13:30.104
Didn't want a medal.

13:30.106 --> 13:32.509
Okay, have a nice day.

13:32.511 --> 13:36.842
Ah, before you go, you might
want to consider my offer.

13:36.844 --> 13:39.744
We might be able to help each other out.

13:39.746 --> 13:42.722
Look, I'm staying at
the Beach Stars Hotel,

13:42.724 --> 13:44.693
it's just up the road, you can't miss it,

13:44.695 --> 13:47.261
right next to that
charming little strip club.

13:47.263 --> 13:49.096
Okay, thanks, great.

13:51.362 --> 13:52.379
And Dave?

13:55.663 --> 13:58.126
Welcome to the treasure hunting business.

13:58.128 --> 13:59.295
Yeah.

14:04.873 --> 14:07.362
Oh that's disgusting.

14:40.959 --> 14:42.054
Hey.

14:42.056 --> 14:43.524
Hey.

14:43.526 --> 14:45.447
Can I help you?

14:45.449 --> 14:47.699
Yeah, do you remember me?

14:49.080 --> 14:51.486
Not really, have we met before?

14:51.488 --> 14:54.574
No, no, we didn't meet per
se, I was just at the bar

14:54.576 --> 14:57.493
with this guy, okay, he's gone now.

14:59.169 --> 15:00.202
But uh...

15:02.469 --> 15:04.460
Ah this is strange, but
he was telling me that

15:04.462 --> 15:06.129
he spoke to you and you told him that you

15:06.131 --> 15:08.056
saw me at the Cactus
Bar yesterday afternoon.

15:08.058 --> 15:09.621
- At the what?
- It's just a little bar,

15:09.623 --> 15:11.456
it's just up the road.

15:12.569 --> 15:13.823
You're a tourist guide, yeah?

15:13.825 --> 15:15.942
Yeah that's right.

15:15.944 --> 15:18.040
I was at the Cactus
Bar with these two kids,

15:18.042 --> 15:19.542
we were talking...

15:20.644 --> 15:22.522
Does any of
this make sense to you?

15:22.524 --> 15:26.818
No, sorry, I
think he has me confused.

15:26.820 --> 15:28.570
Yeah, he must have.

15:29.514 --> 15:30.917
And I'm sorry to have bothered you.

15:30.919 --> 15:34.336
- Don't worry about it.
- Have a nice day.

15:37.336 --> 15:38.672
Uh...

15:38.674 --> 15:41.732
Is there something else?

15:41.734 --> 15:45.484
Have you ever heard
of Francesco Rodriguez?

15:47.129 --> 15:48.146
Figueroa?

15:57.589 --> 15:58.735
Can you see much?

15:58.737 --> 16:02.130
Uh, it's really hard to
tell, they're super small.

16:03.261 --> 16:04.968
Well maybe if you turn it the right way,

16:04.970 --> 16:06.161
you'll be able to see more.

16:06.163 --> 16:07.580
Well maybe if you told me before.

16:07.582 --> 16:09.479
Well they're binoculars,
they're pretty easy.

16:09.481 --> 16:10.820
Well I didn't invent binoculars

16:10.822 --> 16:12.286
the right way

16:12.288 --> 16:13.819
and you might be able to see properly.

16:13.821 --> 16:14.952
- Well that's...
- Okay.

16:14.954 --> 16:16.021
- Okay.
- Okay.

16:16.095 --> 16:17.158
What's he doing?

16:17.258 --> 16:18.337
Uh, he's just talking.

16:18.339 --> 16:19.448
To who?

16:19.548 --> 16:20.939
To a lady.

16:20.941 --> 16:21.974
Oh.

16:23.268 --> 16:25.441
Do you think it's real?

16:25.443 --> 16:26.922
Well I hope it's real.

16:26.924 --> 16:28.978
- Yeah.
- Come here, let me see.

16:28.980 --> 16:30.463
The right way.

16:30.465 --> 16:32.060
- Just keep on talking.
- Yep.

16:32.062 --> 16:33.112
- Okay.
- Well.

16:33.114 --> 16:34.147
Well.

16:34.596 --> 16:36.845
See Cash when you hold the
binoculars the right way...

16:36.847 --> 16:37.963
Oh thanks a lot I'm sorry

16:38.063 --> 16:39.894
I didn't know you were a

16:39.896 --> 16:41.313
binocular doctor.

16:48.066 --> 16:49.149
Yeah 'ello?

16:50.139 --> 16:51.472
Yeah, I met him.

16:52.699 --> 16:56.363
I don't know, I keep
seeing these two kids.

16:56.365 --> 16:59.411
I'm gonna send you some pictures over.

16:59.413 --> 17:00.913
Ah, yep, I got it.

17:02.865 --> 17:05.119
Fucking hard to find a
fax machine though mate.

17:05.122 --> 17:07.428
It's 2015, ever heard of email?

17:07.430 --> 17:09.403
And all the was found
was a message carved into

17:09.405 --> 17:14.045
the bulkheads,.

17:14.047 --> 17:16.086
Which loosely translates to

17:16.088 --> 17:17.771
for my mother after the towers

17:17.773 --> 17:20.290
- of the stars.
- Awesome!

17:20.292 --> 17:22.587
I never knew anyone else
who's heard of this story.

17:22.589 --> 17:25.146
Well it seems like everyone I meet has.

17:25.148 --> 17:26.501
Is that why you're here?

17:26.502 --> 17:27.661
Here in Sardinia?

17:27.663 --> 17:30.230
Yeah, please don't tell
me you mean to look for it.

17:30.232 --> 17:32.406
- Why not?
- Are you seriously

17:32.408 --> 17:35.566
telling me you think there's
treasure to be found?

17:35.568 --> 17:39.882
Well, there's definitely
something to be found.

17:39.884 --> 17:42.738
Look, you seem like a nice
guy, can I show you something?

17:42.740 --> 17:43.834
Sure.

17:48.095 --> 17:50.101
- They're getting up!
- Well where are they going?

17:50.103 --> 17:51.486
Well I don't know.

17:51.488 --> 17:52.521
Hold on.

17:55.703 --> 17:58.141
Hey that's him, that's the guy.

17:58.143 --> 18:01.059
- That's the guy?
- Yeah, that's the guy, Rick.

18:01.061 --> 18:02.965
Rick Murphy.

18:02.967 --> 18:04.579
They're not uh, yep they stopped.

18:04.581 --> 18:05.614
Oh, why?

18:07.144 --> 18:09.144
I don't, I don't know.

18:11.248 --> 18:13.786
They're talking about the guy at the bar.

18:13.788 --> 18:14.821
Oh yeah.

18:17.123 --> 18:18.156
Okay.

18:19.776 --> 18:22.098
Okay listen Dave, if that's
the guy that approached you,

18:22.100 --> 18:23.774
you have to trust me, let this one go.

18:23.776 --> 18:25.962
What are you talking about,
he's a treasure hunter.

18:25.964 --> 18:28.223
Surely that makes the whole
thing all the more plausible?

18:28.225 --> 18:30.011
Not exactly, a treasure
hunter would imply

18:30.013 --> 18:31.204
that he actually hunts.

18:31.206 --> 18:33.789
Well so what he's just a guy?

18:35.356 --> 18:36.777
Okay here's what we're gonna do,

18:36.877 --> 18:38.084
have you got a pen and paper?

18:38.086 --> 18:39.119
Yeah.

18:43.556 --> 18:46.639
Okay, meet me here, at six o'clock.

18:50.759 --> 18:52.915
- Six o'clock!
- Okay.

18:52.917 --> 18:56.940
- She left!
- Oh you bitch, you bitch.

18:56.942 --> 18:58.450
What about the guy?

18:58.452 --> 19:00.535
Well, he's still there.

19:02.408 --> 19:04.172
You know what?

19:04.174 --> 19:07.851
Something is going on, over
there, and I don't like it.

19:07.853 --> 19:09.428
Well we've gotta go and follow him.

19:09.430 --> 19:11.187
Well I think that we do have to do that.

19:11.189 --> 19:12.490
- Take these.
- And okay I will.

19:12.492 --> 19:14.288
- Don't drop them.
- Well don't pass them to

19:14.290 --> 19:15.295
me in an angry fashion.

19:15.395 --> 19:16.582
Oh there we go.

19:16.882 --> 19:18.441
I got some sand on me, yes...

19:18.443 --> 19:20.525
Well it's a beach
Cash, what do you expect?

20:32.863 --> 20:34.544
So how do you know Rick Murphy?

20:34.546 --> 20:36.324
He approached me a couple of weeks ago

20:36.326 --> 20:37.779
when he first arrived in Sardinia.

20:37.879 --> 20:39.019
Approached you about what?

20:39.119 --> 20:41.184
He was looking for someone
with a good foundation

20:41.186 --> 20:42.634
of the southern coastline.

20:42.636 --> 20:44.796
So he tried to enlist me in his service.

20:44.798 --> 20:45.998
See this is what I mean.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.973
So many people are interested
in the Espadrillo dowry,

20:48.975 --> 20:51.085
surely there has to be some truth to it.

20:51.087 --> 20:52.989
Do you think you're
the first treasure hunter

20:52.991 --> 20:54.932
to come through here
looking for Francesco's?

20:56.128 --> 20:57.490
I'm not hunting for treasure.

20:57.492 --> 20:59.743
Either way, I've got tours
up and down this coastline.

20:59.745 --> 21:01.206
If there was treasure to be found,

21:01.208 --> 21:03.258
it would have been found already.

21:04.767 --> 21:06.565
So, how does
someone like you become

21:06.567 --> 21:08.449
a tour guide in Sardinia?

21:08.451 --> 21:10.380
Ah, that's a boring story.

21:10.382 --> 21:13.009
And it looks like a long road.

21:28.766 --> 21:30.782
- You think that's them?
- I do think that's them.

21:30.784 --> 21:32.105
Well, where did they go?

21:32.107 --> 21:33.346
Someone's coming!

21:33.348 --> 21:34.598
Okay just hide!

21:50.663 --> 21:52.196
- Who's that guy?
- That's the guy

21:52.198 --> 21:53.448
from the beach!

21:54.299 --> 21:56.857
I wonder what he's doing here?

21:56.859 --> 21:59.275
I don't know, but I think
we need to follow him though.

21:59.277 --> 22:00.998
Again you're gonna
go with the following?

22:01.098 --> 22:03.053
Yeah it's a good idea,
'cause then you take a,

22:03.055 --> 22:04.124
save our friends.

22:04.224 --> 22:05.359
Your friends?

22:05.361 --> 22:06.402
Who's your friend?

22:06.502 --> 22:07.513
Dave.

22:07.613 --> 22:09.285
Really, you have an obsession with him,

22:09.287 --> 22:10.620
- it's so weird.
- I don't have an

22:10.720 --> 22:11.851
obsession with him I just...

22:11.853 --> 22:13.384
- You do, all you do
- No, we're just

22:13.386 --> 22:15.327
- good friends, I don't know
- is talk about him!

22:15.329 --> 22:16.460
why you're saying that.

22:16.462 --> 22:18.060
I don't know what you're talking about.

22:18.160 --> 22:19.172
This way?

22:22.371 --> 22:24.061
So after spending a summer in London

22:24.063 --> 22:26.384
- I followed him here.
- And it didn't work out?

22:26.484 --> 22:27.868
You live and you learn.

22:27.870 --> 22:29.370
Yeah I guess so.

22:30.701 --> 22:32.541
- True love right?
- Yeah.

22:32.543 --> 22:34.612
- Maybe next time.
- You might just be

22:34.614 --> 22:36.253
naive enough for a treasure hunt.

22:36.255 --> 22:38.513
Psst, get over here!

22:38.515 --> 22:39.848
What the hell?

22:43.828 --> 22:45.728
What the hell?

22:45.730 --> 22:47.535
Who are you?

22:47.537 --> 22:48.554
Hey Dave.

22:49.570 --> 22:50.853
Oh no.

22:50.855 --> 22:53.477
We thought you might not
want to run across him!

22:53.479 --> 22:55.721
Yeah he seems like kind
of a shady character.

22:55.723 --> 22:57.676
He's got a gun
with him and everything!

22:57.678 --> 23:01.271
I don't get it, what makes
him such a dangerous man?

23:01.273 --> 23:03.551
Well after he approached me
I did some research on him,

23:03.553 --> 23:06.377
and have you guys ever heard
of the Silver Swan Project?

23:06.379 --> 23:07.462
- Yeah.
- Yep.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.792
What's the Silver Swan Project?

23:11.794 --> 23:13.349
It was the recovery of

23:13.351 --> 23:16.469
$500 million in coins
from a Spanish shipwreck

23:16.471 --> 23:18.654
off the coast of Portugal.

23:18.656 --> 23:20.946
You see it's rumored
the treasure was shipped

23:20.948 --> 23:24.408
to an undisclosed bunker
somewhere in the US.

23:24.410 --> 23:26.725
What, why?

23:26.727 --> 23:28.595
Well the company
that found the wreck,

23:28.695 --> 23:30.772
was the Poseidon Marine Exploration,

23:30.872 --> 23:33.021
and they brought the loot
back under the jurisdiction

23:33.121 --> 23:34.640
of the US federal court.

23:34.642 --> 23:36.437
So they could keep it.

23:36.439 --> 23:37.586
Exactly.

23:37.588 --> 23:39.273
But the Portuguese
government filed a claim

23:39.275 --> 23:40.614
that the site of the find was in

23:40.616 --> 23:42.126
Portuguese territorial waters.

23:42.128 --> 23:44.078
Which would force the Poseidon Marine

23:44.080 --> 23:46.073
to return the treasure.

23:46.075 --> 23:48.236
- Okay.
- I think the coast is clear.

23:48.238 --> 23:49.271
Yeah.

23:52.356 --> 23:54.390
So, what happened?

23:54.392 --> 23:56.288
Unfortunately nothing yet.

23:56.290 --> 23:57.909
At first it looked like there was a case

23:57.911 --> 23:59.018
when a witness came forth,

23:59.118 --> 24:01.855
but, that witness
mysteriously disappeared.

24:01.857 --> 24:03.733
- So you think...
- Yeah.

24:03.735 --> 24:06.485
- What?
- Rick killed the witness.

24:08.642 --> 24:10.342
Well that makes it all the more real.

24:10.344 --> 24:11.342
No it doesn't.

24:11.344 --> 24:13.437
Aside from the fact that
Rick's less treasure hunter

24:13.439 --> 24:16.033
and more hired gun, why
does it make it more real?

24:16.133 --> 24:18.467
- Make what real?
- The dowry.

24:18.469 --> 24:19.920
Well, why wouldn't it be?

24:19.922 --> 24:21.246
Think about it, all right.

24:21.248 --> 24:23.797
Why would someone entrust
such a large sum of money,

24:23.799 --> 24:25.739
not to mention the faith
of a lucrative marriage

24:25.741 --> 24:27.412
to some random seafarer?

24:27.414 --> 24:29.616
Yeah I think there was a
little more to it than that.

24:29.618 --> 24:31.035
- Well I don't.
- What, so you think

24:31.037 --> 24:32.188
it's just rumors then?

24:32.190 --> 24:35.795
Rumors, here-say,
fairy tales of pirates.

24:35.797 --> 24:37.452
Hmm, no.

24:37.454 --> 24:40.430
Here we are,.

24:40.432 --> 24:41.803
So this is where they found her?

24:41.805 --> 24:42.836
Yep, the tomb of the

24:42.838 --> 24:44.255
- Espadrillo.
- Wow.

24:45.294 --> 24:47.059
Want to explain to me how an experienced

24:47.159 --> 24:48.810
captain sunk his ship in that bay?

24:48.812 --> 24:51.238
What do you mean?

24:51.240 --> 24:52.722
According to historical records,

24:52.724 --> 24:54.408
a ship named the Espadrillo was found off

24:54.410 --> 24:57.682
the coast of Sardinia, some
time in the mid-18th century,

24:57.684 --> 25:01.075
almost 100 years after it last set sail.

25:01.077 --> 25:02.572
Although no cargo was found aboard,

25:02.574 --> 25:04.821
they did find a manifest,
and concluded that

25:04.823 --> 25:06.167
there must have been a survivor.

25:06.169 --> 25:09.243
- Yeah, Francesco.
- According to the records.

25:09.343 --> 25:11.540
What's your point?

25:11.542 --> 25:13.755
Do you see a ship?

25:13.757 --> 25:16.695
Well no, the ship was
moved to the 90-50s, during...

25:16.697 --> 25:18.458
During the advent of
mass tourism to a bay

25:18.460 --> 25:20.043
with better access.

25:20.752 --> 25:22.119
So what?

25:22.121 --> 25:23.786
My point is there's no one here.

25:23.788 --> 25:25.638
Either the shipwreck was never here,

25:25.640 --> 25:28.156
and the entire story was made
up to drive up tour sales.

25:28.158 --> 25:30.752
Uh, uh come on Helena
just, just dream a little

25:30.754 --> 25:32.702
- bit eh?
- Yeah dream a little!

25:32.704 --> 25:35.294
All right if the Espadrillo
really did crash here

25:35.296 --> 25:37.215
and was later moved for easier access,

25:37.217 --> 25:39.050
can you explain to me how one man moved

25:39.052 --> 25:42.353
the entire dowry from below
deck of a sinking ship,

25:42.355 --> 25:45.813
up those cliffs and hid it
where no one would ever find it?

25:45.815 --> 25:48.782
Sorry guys but, it's like
I told you at the beach,

25:48.784 --> 25:50.155
there's no treasure to be found,

25:50.157 --> 25:51.651
and it's definitely not worth getting

25:51.653 --> 25:53.329
involved with the likes of him.

25:57.436 --> 25:59.292
We simply don't have
the credible information

25:59.294 --> 26:01.184
to warrant further investigation.

26:01.186 --> 26:04.103
- Man this sucks!
- This sucks dick!

26:06.927 --> 26:08.853
What if we did?

26:20.628 --> 26:22.059
Quatro please.

26:24.287 --> 26:25.464
What about it?

26:25.466 --> 26:27.431
That's the name
of the promontory right?

26:27.433 --> 26:28.877
- Yep.
- Grazi.

26:28.879 --> 26:30.492
- Well what does it mean?
- Cave of the

26:30.494 --> 26:32.752
- perpetual virgin.
- Oh, okay.

26:32.754 --> 26:34.533
And who is a, perpetual virgin?

26:34.535 --> 26:36.188
I mean it's a bit of

26:36.190 --> 26:39.055
a strange name, do you know what it means?

26:39.057 --> 26:40.772
Well, there's an old story from

26:40.774 --> 26:42.585
around these parts, a
wedding dress was found

26:42.587 --> 26:45.418
at the wreckage of the Espadrillo.

26:45.420 --> 26:47.188
Part of the dowry?

26:47.190 --> 26:49.615
Mmm, it's difficult to say.

26:49.617 --> 26:51.070
We have the manifest, we know that

26:51.170 --> 26:53.040
there were no women aboard ship.

26:53.042 --> 26:55.605
So what, so there was
a cross-dresser on board.

26:55.607 --> 26:57.259
I didn't know they had those back then.

26:57.261 --> 26:59.566
It's an old
sailor's tale probably,

26:59.568 --> 27:01.601
not credible information.

27:01.603 --> 27:03.436
Speaking of which...

27:06.398 --> 27:09.647
Well, up on the cliffs you said uh,

27:09.649 --> 27:11.536
that we didn't have any
credible information

27:11.538 --> 27:14.065
to warrant further investigation.

27:14.067 --> 27:15.611
It's sad but true.

27:15.613 --> 27:18.113
And what if I had something?

27:19.173 --> 27:22.173
- Like what?
- Say uh, I had a diary.

27:25.012 --> 27:26.758
Uh what diary?

27:26.760 --> 27:28.997
A diary written by a

27:28.999 --> 27:31.129
young man shipwrecked in Sardinia,

27:31.131 --> 27:35.075
in 1647.

27:35.077 --> 27:37.168
A diary,

27:37.170 --> 27:38.740
written by a young sailor,

27:38.742 --> 27:40.541
addressed to his mother, with each page

27:40.543 --> 27:44.296
initialed F, R, F.

27:44.298 --> 27:46.560
Francesco Rodriguez Figueroa!

27:46.562 --> 27:48.610
That's what was in the book?

27:48.612 --> 27:51.512
What, so the treasure is real?

27:51.514 --> 27:52.966
You know what that means?

27:52.968 --> 27:54.348
Adventure!

27:54.350 --> 27:55.873
All right, keep it down,

27:55.875 --> 27:57.651
keep it down.

27:57.653 --> 28:01.084
So, you're telling me that
you have the original diary

28:01.086 --> 28:03.753
of Francesco Rodriguez Figueroa?

28:05.453 --> 28:07.545
How do you know it's real?

28:07.547 --> 28:09.974
Has anybody examined it?

28:09.976 --> 28:12.291
Anyone who's equipped to do so?

28:12.293 --> 28:14.535
Does the Fitchburg Museum

28:14.537 --> 28:16.721
of European History qualify?

28:16.723 --> 28:18.866
- I would say so.
- Yep.

28:18.868 --> 28:20.718
Okay, so explain this to me,

28:20.720 --> 28:23.203
how has no one ever heard of it?

28:23.205 --> 28:25.162
Hmm, yeah.

28:25.164 --> 28:26.799
I'm just saying, if you have the

28:26.801 --> 28:30.230
original diary from the Espadrillo,

28:30.232 --> 28:31.661
why hasn't it made its way here?

28:31.663 --> 28:34.238
Hold on, all I said
was that I have a diary,

28:34.240 --> 28:37.823
dated in 1647, written
by a young man, FRF,

28:39.122 --> 28:42.362
on his first voyage across the
Mediterranean with is father.

28:42.364 --> 28:44.658
It was written completely in Italian,

28:44.660 --> 28:47.471
and handed over to the
Fitchburg Museum in the 1960s

28:47.473 --> 28:49.891
by a young Bostonian high school student.

28:49.893 --> 28:51.999
That's why no
one's connected the dots.

28:52.001 --> 28:54.066
What, because it was in Italian?

28:54.068 --> 28:55.458
Well the student found the diary

28:55.460 --> 28:57.528
in his late grandfather's basement,

28:57.530 --> 29:00.122
probably handed it over to
create some kind of legacy.

29:00.124 --> 29:01.839
You see Francesco and everybody

29:01.939 --> 29:03.982
aboard the ship was Spanish.

29:03.984 --> 29:06.696
So that's why an Italian
diary didn't raise any flags.

29:06.698 --> 29:08.929
The diary has to have made its way to

29:08.931 --> 29:11.825
New England in the mass
immigration in 1870.

29:11.827 --> 29:14.539
That journey, that history
of Italian Americans

29:14.541 --> 29:16.925
in New England is enough for any museum

29:16.927 --> 29:18.083
to display something.

29:18.085 --> 29:20.376
So that's why nobody ever
thought to take a closer look.

29:20.476 --> 29:21.509
Exactly.

29:22.758 --> 29:24.504
So what do you say Helena?

29:24.506 --> 29:27.531
Is this enough credible
information for you?

29:27.533 --> 29:28.535
It is, it is!

29:28.537 --> 29:30.284
Yes, okay!

29:30.286 --> 29:32.279
- Where do we start?
- Eh, that's, you know,

29:32.281 --> 29:34.819
Helena's right, there is
no way one person dragged

29:34.821 --> 29:36.825
the entire dowry up those cliffs.

29:36.827 --> 29:40.041
So the Espadrillo must have
crashed into another bay.

29:40.043 --> 29:42.548
So there's only one thing we can do.

29:42.550 --> 29:46.300
We need to go and search,
all the other bays.

30:22.045 --> 30:23.497
Day one.

30:23.499 --> 30:25.505
The weather taunts us today,

30:25.507 --> 30:27.061
our trusty friend the Espadrillo

30:27.063 --> 30:30.271
had promised to take us
across the seas to safety,

30:30.273 --> 30:33.450
but I now know this is not the case.

30:33.452 --> 30:35.850
As the ferocious waves
beat against the hull,

30:35.852 --> 30:38.369
swaying our broken home from side to side,

30:38.371 --> 30:40.367
I feel the burden of this diary,

30:40.369 --> 30:43.060
sitting deep in the Espadrillo's belly,

30:43.062 --> 30:45.570
with every crash I fear it
will drag us down to the depths

30:45.572 --> 30:48.690
of the ocean, and my heart along with it.

30:48.692 --> 30:50.946
Something must be done,
but I fear tomorrow

30:50.948 --> 30:52.432
might be too late.

30:52.434 --> 30:54.974
Francesco Rodriguez Figueroa.

30:54.976 --> 30:57.100
So, if this guy isn't a romantic,

30:57.102 --> 30:58.929
I don't know what is.

30:58.931 --> 31:00.646
It's strange though,
'cause it seems like

31:00.648 --> 31:02.821
he wasn't the only
survivor after the crash.

31:02.823 --> 31:04.130
I know.

31:04.132 --> 31:06.112
He keeps on referencing us so,

31:06.114 --> 31:08.185
there must have been
other survivors, right?

31:08.187 --> 31:10.916
But all the other crew
members were found in the wreck.

31:10.918 --> 31:12.846
He obviously killed them.

31:12.848 --> 31:14.756
Well don't say that,
I'm just liking this guy.

31:34.124 --> 31:36.338
The weather has forgiven us,

31:36.340 --> 31:39.670
just as night fell upon the Espadrillo.

31:39.672 --> 31:43.336
I'm alone now, just me and my heart,

31:43.338 --> 31:45.443
yet I still feel the ropes of the abyss,

31:45.445 --> 31:49.422
the weight of the dowry
dragging us to our doom.

31:49.424 --> 31:51.637
I contemplate my faith, but I know

31:51.639 --> 31:53.666
it is jealousy that has befallen me.

31:53.668 --> 31:55.274
So, he did kill them?

31:55.276 --> 31:57.335
- No he didn't.
- Yes he did, he just said it!

31:57.337 --> 31:59.719
- It doesn't prove anything!
- Yes, oh my god it proves it!

31:59.721 --> 32:00.881
- No it doesn't!
- Why not?

32:00.883 --> 32:03.133
- What?
- What do you think?

32:05.184 --> 32:06.428
Nah, it's nothing.

32:06.430 --> 32:09.679
- What, come on!
- Yeah come on Dave!

32:09.681 --> 32:13.824
There's got to be something
more, to this entry.

32:13.826 --> 32:15.937
Why would a shipwrecked
man chronicle his plans

32:15.939 --> 32:19.532
to massacre his entire
crew, it doesn't make sense.

32:19.534 --> 32:21.289
And for that matter
why even keep a record?

32:21.291 --> 32:22.876
Why not, I mean if anything,

32:22.878 --> 32:26.403
it just proves that he still has hope.

32:26.405 --> 32:29.905
I just don't believe he killed his crew.

32:33.202 --> 32:35.124
Maybe he was the cross-dresser?

32:35.126 --> 32:37.968
All right, all
right, come on, day three.

32:37.970 --> 32:40.345
Day three.

32:40.347 --> 32:42.955
My dear mother, once again I write to you

32:42.957 --> 32:44.804
under the cover of the night,

32:44.806 --> 32:47.432
for there are too many eyes under the sun.

32:47.434 --> 32:49.750
The night belongs to me and my heart.

32:49.752 --> 32:51.508
But this night is different.

32:51.510 --> 32:53.804
I have had time to contemplate.

32:53.806 --> 32:58.184
I am not jealous, true love
cannot be likened to jealousy.

32:58.186 --> 32:59.534
In the silence of the night,

32:59.536 --> 33:01.870
I have brought the dowry on and over deck.

33:01.872 --> 33:03.568
It is time to part with it,

33:03.570 --> 33:05.937
and lose it where no one can find it.

33:05.939 --> 33:08.890
Only my heart shall know where it lies.

33:08.892 --> 33:10.946
So, he sunk it.

33:10.948 --> 33:12.805
How do you think he
sunk the entire treasure

33:12.807 --> 33:13.875
in 10 feet of water Cash?

33:14.075 --> 33:15.762
Oh I don't know, do I, Helena?

33:15.862 --> 33:17.486
How has no one found it?

33:17.488 --> 33:19.224
Well maybe someone has.

33:19.226 --> 33:20.838
No, that I would have heard about.

33:20.840 --> 33:25.007
Well then it's
still out there somewhere.

33:32.584 --> 33:35.538
Well, there's really
only one thing left to do.

33:35.540 --> 33:38.353
If there were ever any down
there we would have found it.

33:38.355 --> 33:40.231
Yeah we were up on the cliffs though.

33:40.233 --> 33:41.266
Exactly.

33:42.274 --> 33:45.691
Okay, so how we gonna do this?

33:47.121 --> 33:49.692
Oh shit, I have an
idea, I have plan, just...

33:49.694 --> 33:50.986
- You, me?
- Come on!

33:50.988 --> 33:52.683
- Us?
- Yeah, yeah of course.

33:56.568 --> 33:58.059
Graceful.

33:58.061 --> 34:00.155
Uh-uh, meet us tomorrow
morning, down by the beach!

34:00.157 --> 34:01.763
Wait, where are you going?

34:01.765 --> 34:03.515
Just do it!

34:07.292 --> 34:09.716
I'll give it to them,
they love an adventure.

34:09.717 --> 34:12.032
Yeah.

34:12.034 --> 34:14.784
Oh, he left his friends behind.

34:15.918 --> 34:17.694
Very nice.

34:17.696 --> 34:19.047
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

35:58.566 --> 35:59.599
Hey.

36:01.027 --> 36:04.444
Yeah it's me.

36:17.897 --> 36:19.007
Morning.

36:19.009 --> 36:20.042
Morning.

36:22.370 --> 36:23.370
So what now?

36:28.230 --> 36:30.584
I have no idea.

36:30.586 --> 36:31.925
Dave.

36:31.927 --> 36:33.184
What's up?

36:33.186 --> 36:34.626
There's something you should know.

36:34.628 --> 36:36.295
Yeah, what's that?

36:37.523 --> 36:40.682
It's difficult for me to say, but...

36:40.684 --> 36:42.601
- Oh shit, we're late.
- I feel like...

36:42.603 --> 36:43.853
We gotta run.

37:44.524 --> 37:46.941
Hey, check this out.

37:48.211 --> 37:49.711
Are you kidding?

38:09.136 --> 38:13.250
Hey, what was it you wanted to tell me?

38:13.252 --> 38:15.833
I just feel like, you
should prepare yourself,

38:15.835 --> 38:19.335
- for the fact that...
- For the fact of what?

38:21.312 --> 38:22.855
For the fact that the treasure might

38:22.857 --> 38:24.774
never be yours to find.

38:27.291 --> 38:30.708
Is there something you want to tell me?

38:31.653 --> 38:33.771
Remember that day we met on the beach,

38:33.773 --> 38:36.121
and you asked me if I recognized you?

38:39.969 --> 38:41.636
Now is not the time.

40:02.565 --> 40:03.753
Day four.

40:03.755 --> 40:06.406
A storm has hit the Espadrillo once again.

40:06.408 --> 40:09.210
I feel the sea must be as upset as I am.

40:09.212 --> 40:11.973
She pushed the Espadrillo
deep into the rocks.

40:11.975 --> 40:13.657
I am the only survivor.

40:13.659 --> 40:15.691
My heart and I must abandon the wreck

40:15.693 --> 40:17.905
and find better shelter on the island.

40:17.907 --> 40:20.181
I have faith in what the future holds,

40:20.183 --> 40:22.204
for the future is in my hands.

40:22.206 --> 40:25.658
I have hidden the dowry
well, no man shall find it,

40:25.660 --> 40:28.816
and I must confess, not even myself.

40:28.818 --> 40:31.469
Francesco Rodriguez Figueroa.

40:31.471 --> 40:32.667
So he hid it.

40:32.669 --> 40:34.780
First he sunk it, now he hid it.

40:34.782 --> 40:36.442
Am I the only one who's really confused?

40:36.444 --> 40:37.575
- No, I'm right there
- No.

40:37.577 --> 40:39.632
- with you.
- At least we're all lost.

40:39.634 --> 40:41.259
Maybe that's a good thing.

40:41.359 --> 40:42.856
Maybe getting lost is the only way

40:42.858 --> 40:44.502
to find something that's gone missing.

40:44.504 --> 40:47.536
Hey can you read that
last sentence again?

40:47.538 --> 40:50.229
I've hidden the dowry
where no man shall find it.

40:50.231 --> 40:52.136
- Not even myself.
- Oh, well that's great news,

40:52.138 --> 40:53.216
isn't it?

40:53.316 --> 40:56.351
Now go back to the last paragraph.

40:56.451 --> 40:58.134
I am not jealous.

40:58.136 --> 41:00.878
True love can not be likened to jealousy.

41:00.880 --> 41:02.246
In the silence of the night I have

41:02.248 --> 41:04.820
brought the dowry on and over deck.

41:04.822 --> 41:07.012
It is time to part with it and sink it,

41:07.014 --> 41:08.793
where no one can find it.

41:08.795 --> 41:12.045
Only my heart shall know where it lies.

41:15.211 --> 41:17.541
What are you doing Dave?

41:17.543 --> 41:19.626
I might have something.

41:21.921 --> 41:23.588
Well tell us then?

41:24.492 --> 41:26.095
Sarah, let's get out of here.

41:26.097 --> 41:28.264
Aye aye Captain!

41:52.160 --> 41:54.526
All right, so we'll
meet at the bar in an hour.

41:54.528 --> 41:55.528
- Bye!
- Bye!

41:57.279 --> 41:59.776
All right let's go!

41:59.778 --> 42:00.945
See you later.

42:22.157 --> 42:24.280
We're not
getting distracted are we?

42:24.282 --> 42:26.057
What the
hell are you doing here?

42:26.059 --> 42:27.583
Consider this a friendly reminder.

42:27.585 --> 42:29.572
While you were out there
playing Treasure Island

42:29.672 --> 42:32.766
with your new friends, some
people are expecting results.

42:32.768 --> 42:34.783
Just because you haven't
seen anything sparkle,

42:34.785 --> 42:36.351
doesn't mean we're not making progress.

42:36.451 --> 42:38.194
Either way, our friends up the chain,

42:38.394 --> 42:39.947
are getting a little impatient.

42:39.949 --> 42:41.998
If you think you're so
much better at it than me,

42:42.098 --> 42:43.914
then why did you hire
me in the first place?

42:50.721 --> 42:54.304
That's right sir,
the bus leaves at 8:30.

42:58.381 --> 43:01.881
Sorry, I'm driving through a tunnel, so...

43:29.127 --> 43:30.333
Ah, excuse me!

43:30.335 --> 43:31.614
Hi, can I help you?

43:31.616 --> 43:32.930
Miss, Sanford?

43:32.932 --> 43:34.007
Yeah that's me.

43:34.009 --> 43:35.642
I was wondering if I could talk to you

43:35.644 --> 43:37.617
about a potential business proposition.

43:37.619 --> 43:39.161
You're a tour guide right?

43:39.163 --> 43:40.523
Yeah that's right.

43:40.525 --> 43:43.071
I'm from the Poseidon
Marine Exploration,

43:43.073 --> 43:46.697
we're a group of historians
specializing in marine salvage.

43:46.699 --> 43:48.580
We're looking to recruit
someone with a in-depth

43:48.582 --> 43:50.844
knowledge of the southern
Sardinian coastline.

43:50.846 --> 43:53.090
- What kind of knowledge?
- Well,

43:53.092 --> 43:57.732
what do you know about
Francesco Rodriguez Figueroa?

43:57.734 --> 43:59.537
So you want me to find
the Espadrillo dowry?

43:59.539 --> 44:00.971
Well, that is the end game.

44:00.973 --> 44:02.890
Thanks but no thanks.

44:04.215 --> 44:07.040
What if I told you we had something?

44:07.042 --> 44:10.042
Something no one's ever seen before?

44:11.654 --> 44:13.488
- I'm listening.
- Don't have to do anything

44:13.490 --> 44:16.490
now, take some time, think about it.

44:19.740 --> 44:23.323
Fucking mozzies.

44:26.161 --> 44:27.911
Uh, shit, wrong side.

44:29.797 --> 44:30.797
Crazy Euros.

44:32.915 --> 44:34.248
Catch you later!

44:43.802 --> 44:45.470
Have you considered that there might be

44:45.472 --> 44:47.451
some historical value to the dowry?

44:47.453 --> 44:50.124
Don't tell me we made
a mistake in hiring you.

44:50.126 --> 44:51.846
You really think there's anyone out there

44:51.848 --> 44:54.345
hunting treasure for the
good of the history books?

44:54.445 --> 44:56.278
There might just be.

44:57.134 --> 44:58.717
Now get off my car.

45:00.143 --> 45:02.794
Not everyone's as materialistic as you.

45:04.215 --> 45:07.939
Yeah, or you just don't
know who you're dealing with.

45:07.941 --> 45:10.108
Just stay out of my way.

45:19.786 --> 45:20.803
Day five.

45:21.659 --> 45:25.354
I fear I will not see
the sun set this evening.

45:25.356 --> 45:27.662
The sea has punished me
with this latest attack

45:27.664 --> 45:30.953
on the Espadrillo, but I do not despair,

45:30.955 --> 45:32.964
for I am with my heart.

45:32.966 --> 45:35.565
And while I may spend my
last day on this earth,

45:35.567 --> 45:37.365
I shall be remembered in my heart,

45:37.367 --> 45:39.092
and in the trees amongst
which I have found

45:39.094 --> 45:42.038
my final resting place.

45:42.040 --> 45:45.135
This shall be my last entry.

45:45.137 --> 45:49.187
To my mother, with love,
from my final resting place

45:49.189 --> 45:51.372
amongst the wood.

45:51.374 --> 45:52.407
F R F.

45:56.228 --> 45:57.465
So what do we know?

45:57.467 --> 46:00.689
We know that the Espadrillo
crashed into a bay.

46:00.691 --> 46:02.486
- Yeah.
- And, we know Francesco

46:02.488 --> 46:03.545
wasn't the only survivor.

46:03.547 --> 46:06.440
Yeah but they did
all die on the first night.

46:06.442 --> 46:07.973
So there's just Francesco,

46:08.073 --> 46:09.795
the Espadrillo, and the dowry.

46:09.797 --> 46:12.659
- Which he threw overboard.
- Where no one will find it.

46:12.661 --> 46:14.477
And, I'm lost again.

46:14.479 --> 46:17.330
Yeah, maybe we need
to look at the bigger picture,

46:17.332 --> 46:20.184
why is the diary written in Italian?

46:20.186 --> 46:21.939
Because it was addressed to his mother.

46:21.941 --> 46:23.497
And she was originally from Italy.

46:23.499 --> 46:26.209
Right, when the Espadrillo was found,

46:26.211 --> 46:28.394
he had carved a message into the bulkheads

46:28.396 --> 46:30.479
of the ship, right there.

46:35.516 --> 46:37.646
Why is the entire
diary written in Italian

46:37.648 --> 46:39.720
yet that message was left in Spanish?

46:39.722 --> 46:43.139
More importantly, why is it misspelled?

46:44.192 --> 46:46.164
You see in Spanish,

46:46.166 --> 46:48.059
is written with an S, meaning after.

46:48.061 --> 46:50.209
Yeah, like, after the
towers of the stars.

46:50.211 --> 46:51.520
Yeah but he wrote it without,

46:51.522 --> 46:52.566
which in Italian means...

46:52.568 --> 46:54.496
Between, between the towers

46:54.498 --> 46:55.587
of the stars.

46:55.687 --> 46:56.980
Right.

46:56.982 --> 46:59.620
So take a look at this.

46:59.622 --> 47:02.268
We got Torres Gelustov,

47:02.270 --> 47:04.982
and we got the Action Tower.

47:04.984 --> 47:06.317
And in between...

47:06.319 --> 47:08.529
Virgin a perpetua.

47:08.531 --> 47:09.861
Yeah but we were there.

47:09.863 --> 47:11.344
If he sunk the treasure into the bay,

47:11.346 --> 47:12.707
it would have already been found.

47:12.709 --> 47:15.592
And no doubt there, check this out.

47:16.605 --> 47:18.007
I shall be remembered in my heart,

47:18.009 --> 47:19.779
and in the trees amongst
which I have found

47:19.781 --> 47:21.888
my final resting place.

47:21.890 --> 47:22.973
Right there.

47:22.975 --> 47:25.460
What, so he died, and then
he went and buried himself.

47:25.462 --> 47:27.309
I didn't even know you could do that.

47:27.311 --> 47:29.471
Look, all I'm
saying is, that is where

47:29.473 --> 47:31.556
Francesco wants us to go.

47:33.720 --> 47:36.195
Cash, do you think we can
have that boat for another day?

47:36.197 --> 47:38.553
Yeah I think that's covered.

47:38.555 --> 47:42.544
How 'bout that, do you
think you could find that?

47:42.546 --> 47:44.188
What is it?

47:44.190 --> 47:45.243
Well if you opened it,

47:45.245 --> 47:46.876
- Well is was,
- then maybe you'll be

47:46.878 --> 47:48.472
- able to tell.
- I was gonna, but then

47:48.474 --> 47:50.704
you took it, so I didn't get
a chance to really do that.

47:51.900 --> 47:52.948
What is it then?

47:53.148 --> 47:54.312
It's a transmitter.

47:54.314 --> 47:57.397
What do you need a transmitter for?

47:59.638 --> 48:02.500
Look, we all know the dowry's real.

48:02.502 --> 48:04.101
And we all know we're not the only ones

48:04.103 --> 48:05.936
looking for it, right?

48:07.512 --> 48:09.512
Yeah, best be careful.

48:10.402 --> 48:12.447
I don't get it.

48:12.449 --> 48:14.600
He wants us to tag whatever we find,

48:14.602 --> 48:16.386
not just carry it around with us.

48:16.388 --> 48:18.588
So no one's the wiser.

48:18.590 --> 48:19.590
All right.

48:20.447 --> 48:22.731
You guys get the boat,

48:22.733 --> 48:25.156
and we head out at first light, tomorrow.

48:25.158 --> 48:27.740
- Okay, thanks.
- Where are you going?

48:27.742 --> 48:31.242
There is something I gotta take care of.

48:32.618 --> 48:33.741
- Adios.
- Be safe.

48:33.743 --> 48:34.856
Bye, see you tomorrow.

48:34.858 --> 48:36.342
Bye.

48:36.344 --> 48:38.565
So, another round?

48:38.567 --> 48:40.658
Yes, I'm empty.

48:40.660 --> 48:42.495
- I'm gonna head off too.
- Okay.

48:42.497 --> 48:45.364
Yeah it's probably for the
best, it's getting late, so...

48:45.366 --> 48:46.373
- Thank you!
- Okay!

48:46.473 --> 48:47.570
- Bye guys!
- Bye!

48:47.572 --> 48:48.687
- Bye!
- See you soon!

48:48.689 --> 48:50.782
- More for me!
- More for us, that's

48:50.784 --> 48:51.838
my here.

48:51.840 --> 48:52.844
Cash it doesn't matter,

48:52.846 --> 48:54.477
- Yeah it does.
- We're gonna drink it

48:54.479 --> 48:55.910
- anyway!
- I'm not gonna drink from

48:55.912 --> 48:57.502
his wine, I don't even know the guy,

48:57.602 --> 48:58.862
he's been drinking from it.

48:58.864 --> 49:00.234
- Are you done?
- All right, yep.

49:00.236 --> 49:01.284
- Okay, cheers!
- Cheers!

49:24.151 --> 49:26.241
Well that was quick.

49:26.243 --> 49:28.001
I told you I don't have anything yet.

49:28.003 --> 49:31.789
I know, I know, I'm not here to pester.

49:31.791 --> 49:34.452
But your boy seems like
he's onto something.

49:34.454 --> 49:35.568
He's passionate.

49:35.570 --> 49:38.015
Yeah, good for him.

49:38.017 --> 49:39.270
Why do you think he's the one

49:39.272 --> 49:40.783
that's piecing it all together?

49:40.785 --> 49:43.595
He wants it to be true, don't you get it?

49:43.597 --> 49:46.524
For you it's just another score.

49:46.526 --> 49:47.846
He actually lives this stuff.

49:47.848 --> 49:50.093
No arguments here.

49:50.095 --> 49:52.960
I mean he might actually live
for this stuff a bit too much.

49:52.962 --> 49:54.198
What do you mean?

49:54.200 --> 49:58.028
Well, after our little
conversation yesterday evening,

49:58.030 --> 50:00.263
I'm not gonna lie, it felt like your

50:00.265 --> 50:02.682
loyalty was starting to fray.

50:05.159 --> 50:08.645
Consider this a little
boost to your motivation.

50:08.647 --> 50:09.924
Catch you later!

50:36.162 --> 50:37.936
- Hey!
- Hey!

50:37.938 --> 50:39.186
Did you find it?

50:39.188 --> 50:40.282
Ah, did I find it?

50:40.284 --> 50:41.317
Yeah.

50:43.284 --> 50:44.671
- Yeah, yeah I found it.
- Great!

50:44.673 --> 50:45.706
Okay.

50:49.411 --> 50:50.915
Are we going for the same boat?

50:50.917 --> 50:52.211
Yeah I think so let's get it.

50:52.213 --> 50:53.796
Hold on, hold on!

50:58.879 --> 51:00.212
- Hey Cash?
- Yeah?

51:01.836 --> 51:04.182
I just want you to
know, whatever happens,

51:04.184 --> 51:06.356
I'm glad we ditched our
phones that morning.

51:06.358 --> 51:08.293
You know I don't care if
we don't find anything,

51:08.295 --> 51:11.212
I'm just glad there's some
adventure left in the world.

51:11.312 --> 51:13.162
Yeah me too.

51:13.164 --> 51:14.932
All right let's steal a boat.

51:14.934 --> 51:15.965
Borrow!

51:15.967 --> 51:17.000
Borrow.

52:10.720 --> 52:13.220
- Okay this looks good.
- Nice!

52:14.257 --> 52:17.007
- Goodies in the bag!
- All right!

52:19.908 --> 52:22.119
Okay, so we're looking
about a two hour hike.

52:22.121 --> 52:23.204
- Uh-hmm.
- Okay.

52:23.206 --> 52:25.801
Someone's gotta stay
behind with the boat.

52:25.803 --> 52:27.315
- No.
- Not me!

52:27.317 --> 52:29.090
Whoo!

52:29.092 --> 52:31.175
Looks like its you man.

52:35.717 --> 52:38.134
Cash, look after that for me.

52:42.305 --> 52:43.792
Adios.

54:04.948 --> 54:07.006
Well, here it is,

54:07.008 --> 54:10.005
Francesco's final resting
place under the wood.

54:10.007 --> 54:12.301
Would it have killed
him to be more specific?

54:12.303 --> 54:13.598
Yeah, let's get scouting.

54:13.600 --> 54:15.612
- Yeah.
- Got that transmitter?

54:15.614 --> 54:20.390
Yeah, here's the receiver,
and the transmitter.

54:20.392 --> 54:21.392
Nice work.

54:22.777 --> 54:26.027
- Here you want to take that?
- Yep, sure.

54:27.807 --> 54:29.358
Hey where are you going?

54:29.360 --> 54:33.601
I'm just gonna look,
see if we can loop around.

55:19.576 --> 55:22.285
Check this out!

55:22.287 --> 55:23.870
Hey what you got?

55:25.529 --> 55:26.779
Here!

55:36.378 --> 55:37.587
What is it?

55:37.589 --> 55:39.049
It's a.

55:39.051 --> 55:40.084
Again?

55:42.282 --> 55:45.782
There's got to be another one somewhere.

56:01.577 --> 56:03.577
I think I got something!

56:06.440 --> 56:07.473
Yes!

56:08.472 --> 56:12.639
So it's gotta be somewhere
between the two, right?

56:23.224 --> 56:24.685
Here?

56:24.687 --> 56:25.720
Yeah.

57:01.712 --> 57:02.962
Check this out!

57:09.659 --> 57:10.909
Aw...

57:17.054 --> 57:18.151
Is it?

57:18.153 --> 57:20.045
Go ahead.

57:42.694 --> 57:44.194
This is awesome!

57:51.897 --> 57:53.324
What, you don't want to tag it?

57:53.326 --> 57:56.333
No, this is too good
to leave in the ground.

57:56.335 --> 57:57.368
Okay.

57:58.141 --> 57:59.666
What do you think it is?

57:59.668 --> 58:01.576
Whatever I said now
would be pure speculation.

58:01.578 --> 58:02.670
Let's get back to the boat.

58:02.672 --> 58:03.922
Okay.

58:06.360 --> 58:08.007
This is so exciting!

58:08.009 --> 58:09.655
Have you found something?

58:09.657 --> 58:11.847
I'll show you on the boat, let's go!

58:11.849 --> 58:13.524
Cash is gonna love this!

58:38.962 --> 58:40.545
Guys, where's Cash?

58:43.222 --> 58:44.255
G'day!

58:45.693 --> 58:46.805
No!

58:46.807 --> 58:47.961
No no!

58:47.963 --> 58:49.030
No no no no!

58:49.032 --> 58:52.037
Ah ah ah ah ah!

58:52.039 --> 58:53.072
Nice job.

58:54.364 --> 58:56.323
What do you want?

58:56.325 --> 58:57.358
Really?

58:59.910 --> 59:01.493
Are you serious?

59:01.495 --> 59:03.107
I want what you found!

59:03.109 --> 59:04.571
Tough luck man!

59:04.573 --> 59:05.706
There's nothing out there!

59:05.806 --> 59:08.058
All up Dave you're really
starting to piss me off!

59:08.060 --> 59:10.261
- You're pissed off?
- Hey chill out Sheila,

59:10.263 --> 59:12.061
no reason anyone should get hurt!

59:12.063 --> 59:13.756
Rick, what are you doing?

59:13.758 --> 59:17.119
- What do you want?
- Let's start with the bag!

59:17.121 --> 59:18.154
Fine!

59:25.513 --> 59:27.693
There's fuck all in here!

59:27.695 --> 59:31.980
Told you man, there's
nothing to be found!

59:31.982 --> 59:33.232
Now let him go.

59:36.635 --> 59:38.128
Check his back pocket.

59:39.398 --> 59:40.431
What?

59:46.471 --> 59:48.623
I saw him stuff something
in his back pocket.

59:48.625 --> 59:49.720
Ah!

59:49.722 --> 59:50.755
Betrayal!

59:57.592 --> 59:58.974
Wait!

59:58.976 --> 01:00:00.226
Give it to her!

01:00:11.645 --> 01:00:13.187
And?

01:00:13.189 --> 01:00:14.206
What is it?

01:00:17.404 --> 01:00:18.905
I'm gonna need some time.

01:00:18.907 --> 01:00:20.740
Here, take this too!

01:00:24.608 --> 01:00:27.358
All right, everyone, on the boat!

01:00:42.063 --> 01:00:43.136
Where to?

01:00:43.138 --> 01:00:44.879
Just head south.

01:00:44.979 --> 01:00:46.380
There's nothing south of here.

01:00:46.382 --> 01:00:47.994
That's the point.

01:01:20.184 --> 01:01:22.184
All right, slow it down.

01:01:26.366 --> 01:01:28.101
Well, what now, what do you think

01:01:28.103 --> 01:01:29.227
we're gonna find out here?

01:01:29.229 --> 01:01:31.754
Hey, shut the fuck all!

01:01:31.756 --> 01:01:32.789
Anything?

01:01:33.808 --> 01:01:35.887
Can't make sense of it.

01:01:35.889 --> 01:01:38.598
What's that scribbled across the top?

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:41.384
Loosely translated,

01:01:41.386 --> 01:01:43.997
this is how you find our legacy.

01:01:43.999 --> 01:01:46.749
And what does that mean?

01:01:48.326 --> 01:01:49.576
I don't know.

01:01:50.834 --> 01:01:53.268
All right, time for a change of tactic.

01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:54.412
In you go, tits!

01:01:56.373 --> 01:01:58.600
- What are you doing?
- That's off, stay!

01:01:58.602 --> 01:02:00.099
All right all right I'll tell you,

01:02:00.101 --> 01:02:01.768
just let her on the boat!

01:02:01.770 --> 01:02:03.251
- What is it?
- It's a code!

01:02:03.253 --> 01:02:05.073
- A code?
- Yeah it's a code

01:02:05.075 --> 01:02:06.930
- but I can't show you here!
- Sarah, Sarah!

01:02:06.932 --> 01:02:08.220
Then where?

01:02:08.222 --> 01:02:09.750
We have to head back to the island!

01:02:09.752 --> 01:02:11.522
- Back to the island?
- Yeah!

01:02:11.524 --> 01:02:12.805
All right!

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:15.432
What the hell are you doing?

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:17.045
Rick you can't do this!

01:02:18.297 --> 01:02:19.559
- Dammit Rick!
- Stop the boat!

01:02:19.561 --> 01:02:20.780
No come back!

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.727
- Come back!
- Now, it's gonna take

01:02:22.729 --> 01:02:25.006
about 30 minutes to
get back to the island.

01:02:25.008 --> 01:02:26.816
You better hope you're
as good a code breaker

01:02:26.818 --> 01:02:28.311
as you think you are.

01:02:28.313 --> 01:02:30.578
Any luck, we'll be coming back
here in just over an hour.

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:31.676
Stop the boat!

01:02:31.678 --> 01:02:33.422
All right, all right, I'll tell you now,

01:02:33.424 --> 01:02:34.596
just stop the boat!

01:02:34.598 --> 01:02:36.681
No I kind of like the
stuck here.

01:02:36.683 --> 01:02:38.678
Dammit man you gonna
let them die out there?

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:40.028
No, you're gonna let them die,

01:02:40.030 --> 01:02:41.259
if you don't break that code!

01:02:42.455 --> 01:02:43.711
What the hell are you doing?

01:02:51.279 --> 01:02:53.287
♪ Waltzing Matilda

01:02:53.289 --> 01:02:55.616
♪ Waltzing Matilda

01:02:55.618 --> 01:02:59.718
♪ Oh come a waltzing, Matilda with me

01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:01.669
♪ And he sang as he something

01:03:01.671 --> 01:03:05.803
♪ And he something and he something

01:03:05.805 --> 01:03:07.299
♪ I really should'a learned

01:03:07.301 --> 01:03:10.317
♪ The fucking words to the song

01:03:10.319 --> 01:03:13.242
Ah, maybe I should have
paid attention in school.

01:03:14.856 --> 01:03:17.832
Ah well I'm rich now, who cares?

01:03:17.834 --> 01:03:18.867
Ooh, no!

01:03:29.312 --> 01:03:30.895
Come on Sarah, just keep kicking!

01:03:30.897 --> 01:03:32.275
I can't move my hands!

01:03:32.277 --> 01:03:34.677
Please, put your arms around my neck!

01:03:34.679 --> 01:03:35.693
Okay!

01:03:35.695 --> 01:03:38.035
- Like this?
- Yeah, good.

01:03:38.037 --> 01:03:41.634
Oh my, how's that, are
you okay, are you okay?

01:03:41.636 --> 01:03:45.307
- I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry!
- I'm okay, are you okay?

01:03:45.309 --> 01:03:47.858
I'm fine.

01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:48.860
So what now?

01:03:55.084 --> 01:03:57.834
Come on Skippy, rise and shine!

01:04:01.954 --> 01:04:03.621
How 'bout that code?

01:04:06.831 --> 01:04:08.498
You got the diary!

01:04:10.641 --> 01:04:11.641
The diary?

01:04:12.743 --> 01:04:14.910
You want to help me out?

01:04:25.602 --> 01:04:29.332
All right, see this first number here?

01:04:29.334 --> 01:04:30.915
- That's the entry.
- Uh huh.

01:04:30.917 --> 01:04:32.841
The second number is the line,

01:04:32.843 --> 01:04:35.286
and the third one is the character.

01:04:35.288 --> 01:04:38.450
All right, first letter, entry three,

01:04:38.452 --> 01:04:40.119
- Uh huh.
- line two.

01:04:42.414 --> 01:04:43.664
15th character.

01:04:45.116 --> 01:04:47.634
- All right, T.
- T, great!

01:04:47.636 --> 01:04:50.053
Second letter, entry seven.

01:04:51.979 --> 01:04:53.812
- Uh hmm.
- Line three.

01:04:55.487 --> 01:04:56.654
9th character.

01:04:57.844 --> 01:04:59.190
- R.
- R, come on,

01:04:59.192 --> 01:05:01.377
save your friends!

01:05:01.379 --> 01:05:03.815
All right, next one.

01:05:08.011 --> 01:05:10.790
I don't think
they're coming back for us.

01:05:10.792 --> 01:05:13.135
They could still
have a few.

01:05:13.137 --> 01:05:14.815
Happy as ever.

01:05:14.817 --> 01:05:16.234
So am I.

01:05:17.964 --> 01:05:21.052
At least we had
our adventure, anyway.

01:05:21.054 --> 01:05:24.646
- I love you Sarah.
- I love you too!

01:05:32.462 --> 01:05:34.295
All right, last one.

01:05:35.823 --> 01:05:36.823
Entry three,

01:05:40.404 --> 01:05:41.904
- line four.
- Uh hm.

01:05:43.942 --> 01:05:45.275
9th character.

01:05:46.482 --> 01:05:47.815
- O.
- All right!

01:06:00.733 --> 01:06:03.562
This is where you'll find our legacy,

01:06:03.564 --> 01:06:05.999
between the tower and
stars in the morning six,

01:06:06.001 --> 01:06:09.345
- forever secret.
- Forever secret my ass!

01:06:09.347 --> 01:06:10.788
But what does it mean!

01:06:10.790 --> 01:06:13.755
Oh figure it out yourself,
I'm done with this!

01:06:13.757 --> 01:06:14.926
- Helena!
- Hey hey hey!

01:06:14.928 --> 01:06:16.268
- Helena!
- Answer me!

01:06:16.270 --> 01:06:18.300
What does it mean Dave?

01:06:18.302 --> 01:06:19.437
I don't know!

01:06:19.439 --> 01:06:20.738
Oh!

01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:23.441
Getting sick and tired of your shit!

01:06:23.443 --> 01:06:26.247
I guess it means the
dowry is at the tower!

01:06:26.249 --> 01:06:27.249
The tower!

01:06:29.408 --> 01:06:31.235
Hey, hey hey!

01:06:31.237 --> 01:06:33.198
What's all this morning six business?

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:35.079
I don't know, six a.m. in the morning!

01:06:35.081 --> 01:06:36.612
Now give me the keys to the boat!

01:06:36.614 --> 01:06:40.573
The way I see it, you need the boat,

01:06:40.575 --> 01:06:44.120
correction, you need me
to find your friends,

01:06:44.122 --> 01:06:47.541
and I need you to find that dowry, right?

01:06:47.543 --> 01:06:48.877
Right.

01:06:48.879 --> 01:06:51.130
So this is how it's gonna happen.

01:06:51.132 --> 01:06:53.397
You're gonna be at that tower at six a.m.,

01:06:53.399 --> 01:06:57.216
ready, willing, able, I'm
gonna go get your friends.

01:06:57.218 --> 01:06:58.662
We'll meet you there.

01:06:58.664 --> 01:07:01.616
And once I have that dowry,

01:07:01.618 --> 01:07:04.502
we'll all go our separate ways.

01:07:04.504 --> 01:07:05.944
We got a deal?

01:07:05.946 --> 01:07:09.377
Fine, but you best
bring them back alive!

01:07:09.379 --> 01:07:12.803
Great!

01:07:12.805 --> 01:07:15.055
Let's go get that treasure!

01:07:20.337 --> 01:07:21.370
Helena!

01:07:23.532 --> 01:07:24.565
Helena!

01:07:25.546 --> 01:07:27.556
- Helena stop!
- What!

01:07:27.558 --> 01:07:28.719
What do you want from me?

01:07:28.721 --> 01:07:30.737
I did not sign up for this!

01:07:30.739 --> 01:07:33.427
Murdering people out in the open sea!

01:07:33.429 --> 01:07:35.752
I'm sorry I crossed you but,

01:07:35.754 --> 01:07:36.982
this has got way out of hand!

01:07:36.984 --> 01:07:38.342
Helena we need to fix this,

01:07:38.344 --> 01:07:40.915
we can't let him find the treasure!

01:07:40.917 --> 01:07:43.199
The, the treasure?

01:07:43.201 --> 01:07:46.205
Two innocent people are
floating around out there,

01:07:46.207 --> 01:07:48.197
and for what, phantom treasure?

01:07:48.199 --> 01:07:49.931
I know you care, and I know you

01:07:49.933 --> 01:07:51.715
want this find to be recorded,

01:07:51.717 --> 01:07:53.989
to be added to the history books!

01:07:53.991 --> 01:07:56.700
What do you think is gonna
happen when Rick finds it?

01:07:56.702 --> 01:07:58.989
He's gonna hand it over to
Poseidon Marine Exploration.

01:07:58.991 --> 01:08:01.090
They're a bunch of criminals!

01:08:01.092 --> 01:08:03.784
Oh really, and what
makes you so much better?

01:08:03.786 --> 01:08:05.269
- What do you mean?
- How did you get

01:08:05.271 --> 01:08:06.282
the diary Dave?

01:08:06.382 --> 01:08:09.132
How did I get the diary?

01:08:12.449 --> 01:08:13.699
You stole it!

01:08:14.615 --> 01:08:17.365
How are you any better than them?

01:08:19.501 --> 01:08:21.582
You're right!

01:08:21.584 --> 01:08:24.447
I can't go home because I stole a diary!

01:08:24.448 --> 01:08:27.363
A diary collecting dust
in a museum somewhere.

01:08:27.366 --> 01:08:30.260
So I made a judgment call and I took it,

01:08:30.261 --> 01:08:33.345
with every intention of returning it.

01:08:34.299 --> 01:08:37.478
Look Helena, I need your help!

01:08:37.479 --> 01:08:39.495
And I know you want to
believe this diary is real,

01:08:39.497 --> 01:08:41.747
so let's find out together!

01:08:44.631 --> 01:08:47.129
You're right, I want
to believe it's real,

01:08:47.131 --> 01:08:48.234
I just know it isn't.

01:08:48.237 --> 01:08:52.318
I'm sorry Dave, and I'm
sorry about Sarah and Cash.

01:08:52.319 --> 01:08:54.341
I just don't see how it ends.

01:10:00.249 --> 01:10:02.332
Where's Cash and Sarah?

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:06.355
You didn't get them?

01:10:06.357 --> 01:10:08.482
I didn't need them.

01:10:08.484 --> 01:10:09.734
You understand.

01:10:14.977 --> 01:10:16.727
We had a deal!

01:10:16.729 --> 01:10:18.812
And the deal's changed.

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:21.740
You're damn right it has.

01:10:21.742 --> 01:10:23.425
Good luck finding the dowry on your own.

01:10:23.525 --> 01:10:25.903
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

01:10:26.003 --> 01:10:28.378
You're a psychopath, and an idiot!

01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:29.961
By letting those two kids die out there

01:10:29.963 --> 01:10:31.829
you gave up the only leverage you had!

01:10:31.831 --> 01:10:33.081
That's right!

01:10:34.207 --> 01:10:37.274
But that's why I brought more collateral.

01:10:39.311 --> 01:10:40.690
Mother fuck!

01:10:40.692 --> 01:10:41.921
I told you,

01:10:41.923 --> 01:10:43.698
your allegiance is fading.

01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:45.531
Why I did everything you want!

01:10:45.533 --> 01:10:46.950
Just s-stop it, stop it!

01:10:47.050 --> 01:10:48.621
Hey!

01:10:48.623 --> 01:10:50.185
Are we gonna go and find that treasure?

01:10:50.187 --> 01:10:54.104
Yeah, we're gonna go
find the treasure, okay?

01:10:56.718 --> 01:10:58.666
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:10:58.668 --> 01:11:01.835
Let's go!

01:11:34.731 --> 01:11:35.764
What now?

01:11:39.823 --> 01:11:42.764
This is where you will find our legacy,

01:11:42.766 --> 01:11:45.516
between the tower, and the stars.

01:11:47.363 --> 01:11:50.600
He's not talking about
location, but a time.

01:11:50.602 --> 01:11:51.935
What's the time?

01:11:52.971 --> 01:11:54.004
5:57.

01:11:56.403 --> 01:12:00.570
In the morning six, between
the tower and the stars.

01:12:05.604 --> 01:12:08.997
What stands between the
tower and the stars?

01:12:08.999 --> 01:12:10.032
Stars?

01:12:12.212 --> 01:12:15.185
The sun, he's talking about sunlight.

01:12:19.709 --> 01:12:21.709
So it's here, it's here.

01:12:24.210 --> 01:12:25.243
Dig!

01:12:45.806 --> 01:12:46.839
There!

01:12:48.422 --> 01:12:49.422
Take it out!

01:12:57.198 --> 01:12:59.031
What the hell is that?

01:13:01.672 --> 01:13:03.839
Isn't there anything else?

01:13:05.221 --> 01:13:06.388
Go on open it!

01:13:14.562 --> 01:13:15.813
That's it?

01:13:15.815 --> 01:13:17.982
You were right.

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:22.192
What the hell is going on?

01:13:22.194 --> 01:13:25.901
- The dowry isn't real.
- Then what the hell is this?

01:13:25.903 --> 01:13:28.570
It's Francesco's wedding ring.

01:13:30.008 --> 01:13:32.027
Francesco died!

01:13:32.029 --> 01:13:35.066
Not exactly, and he
wasn't the only survivor.

01:13:35.068 --> 01:13:37.789
I'm alone now, just me and my heart.

01:13:37.791 --> 01:13:41.446
For the night belongs
to me and my heart.

01:13:41.448 --> 01:13:44.006
He was talking about a woman?

01:13:44.008 --> 01:13:46.758
He was talking about the woman.

01:13:52.452 --> 01:13:54.058
How does an experienced captain sink

01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:55.965
his ship in this bay?

01:13:55.967 --> 01:13:57.550
Do it on purpose.

01:13:58.971 --> 01:14:00.740
Francesco was in love
with the very woman

01:14:00.742 --> 01:14:02.894
who's dowry he was shipping
across the Mediterranean.

01:14:02.896 --> 01:14:04.632
So he crashed the ship into the bay,

01:14:04.634 --> 01:14:07.407
making sure the dowry would never arrive.

01:14:07.409 --> 01:14:10.068
Then why wasn't the
dowry aboard the wreck?

01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:12.080
They gave it away.

01:14:12.082 --> 01:14:15.908
I have faith in the future
for the future is in my hands.

01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:17.240
They?

01:14:17.242 --> 01:14:18.428
Francesco and his love,

01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:20.401
he brought her along as a stowaway.

01:14:20.403 --> 01:14:22.485
This is where you will find our legacy,

01:14:22.487 --> 01:14:25.154
between the tower and the stars.

01:14:26.890 --> 01:14:29.966
Where's the fucking dowry?

01:14:29.968 --> 01:14:33.660
It's gone, distributed
amongst travelers,

01:14:33.662 --> 01:14:35.245
farmers, seafarers.

01:14:36.332 --> 01:14:37.886
They knew it would be their undoing.

01:14:37.888 --> 01:14:39.488
I'm not fucking bluffing!

01:14:39.490 --> 01:14:42.073
Nothing more to tell you man.

01:14:45.312 --> 01:14:46.395
Fuck, fuck!

01:14:49.022 --> 01:14:50.055
Fuck!

01:14:50.728 --> 01:14:51.761
No!

01:14:52.690 --> 01:14:56.566
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:14:56.568 --> 01:14:57.685
Fuck, fuck!

01:15:02.516 --> 01:15:04.311
Got the time?

01:15:04.313 --> 01:15:05.418
6:15.

01:15:05.518 --> 01:15:06.874
You want to get out of here?

01:15:06.876 --> 01:15:07.909
Yeah.

01:15:09.985 --> 01:15:13.855
So Dave then, I'm sorry
about Sarah and Cash.

01:15:13.857 --> 01:15:16.274
I just don't see how it ends.

01:15:22.333 --> 01:15:24.916
I can tell you how this ends!

01:15:26.222 --> 01:15:30.675
You see it's not about
finding the treasure.

01:15:30.677 --> 01:15:33.299
But you got to help me first.

01:15:33.301 --> 01:15:36.277
It's not about
finding the treasure?

01:15:36.279 --> 01:15:38.029
You gotta trust me.

01:15:39.802 --> 01:15:41.719
Do you trust me Helena?

01:15:46.438 --> 01:15:47.471
Come on.

01:15:48.864 --> 01:15:50.531
I gotta make a call.

01:16:22.994 --> 01:16:25.161
A little early for a beer.

01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:32.816
Hey you got the time?

01:16:32.818 --> 01:16:33.901
Mine's broke.

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:38.927
It's the least you can do.

01:16:40.961 --> 01:16:41.961
It's 12:30

01:16:44.557 --> 01:16:46.724
12:30, I don't think so.

01:16:51.998 --> 01:16:55.273
All right, I can see how you get confused.

01:16:55.275 --> 01:16:57.726
I mean I don't want to call you a liar,

01:16:57.728 --> 01:17:01.811
in a way it's 12:30, but
in a much more real way,

01:17:02.917 --> 01:17:03.950
it's 11:30

01:17:05.924 --> 01:17:08.424
It's summer, daylight savings?

01:17:10.093 --> 01:17:11.954
Fun fact about daylight savings,

01:17:11.956 --> 01:17:14.975
it wasn't introduced until
the early 20th century.

01:17:14.977 --> 01:17:16.641
Hey, listen, while I have you do you mind

01:17:16.643 --> 01:17:18.703
if I tell you a story?

01:17:18.705 --> 01:17:20.788
See that girl over there?

01:17:22.819 --> 01:17:25.441
The one with the cracking ass, right?

01:17:25.443 --> 01:17:28.396
Well, she's telling me
this story about how she

01:17:28.398 --> 01:17:30.217
calls this guy up, and
she's telling me about

01:17:30.219 --> 01:17:33.967
this treasure and how it
might not be real at all.

01:17:33.969 --> 01:17:38.630
Now you see this guy, he's
a bit of a psychopath.

01:17:38.632 --> 01:17:40.135
You see he left these two kids out in

01:17:40.235 --> 01:17:42.593
the open water to die.

01:17:42.595 --> 01:17:44.448
All right, here they are.

01:17:44.450 --> 01:17:45.833
- Dave!
- Hey!

01:17:45.835 --> 01:17:47.765
Yeah that's a really good story.

01:17:47.767 --> 01:17:49.665
The guy was a proper knot-head.

01:17:49.667 --> 01:17:51.229
A real dick.

01:17:51.231 --> 01:17:53.290
Anyway, she's going about this treasure

01:17:53.292 --> 01:17:54.881
and how it might not be real

01:17:54.883 --> 01:17:58.802
and how he should you know,
eliminate the witnesses.

01:17:58.804 --> 01:18:01.096
But here's the kicker.

01:18:01.098 --> 01:18:03.333
You see she's with this other guy,

01:18:03.335 --> 01:18:04.999
and they grab a boat.

01:18:05.001 --> 01:18:06.941
Now luckily for them through a series of,

01:18:06.943 --> 01:18:09.652
well, irrelevant circumstances,

01:18:09.654 --> 01:18:12.293
one of the kids had a transmitter on her,

01:18:12.295 --> 01:18:15.962
and even luckier, the
girl had the receiver.

01:18:18.524 --> 01:18:20.742
Great, you saved your friends.

01:18:20.744 --> 01:18:23.295
Warms my fucking heart.

01:18:23.297 --> 01:18:27.685
Yeah but you see this
guy, he's a bit of an idiot,

01:18:27.687 --> 01:18:29.409
so when he meets the
girl the next morning,

01:18:29.411 --> 01:18:31.327
he thinks he's got the upper hand.

01:18:31.329 --> 01:18:33.205
But in reality he doesn't.

01:18:33.207 --> 01:18:35.449
So, thinking he's got the upper hand,

01:18:35.451 --> 01:18:37.068
drags the girl and the guy to the site

01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:40.110
of what he believes is the treasure.

01:18:40.112 --> 01:18:42.856
Ah, you know this part right?

01:18:42.858 --> 01:18:45.611
Turns out, there's no
treasure to be found.

01:18:45.613 --> 01:18:46.646
Uh-uh.

01:18:48.150 --> 01:18:49.250
Great story.

01:18:49.252 --> 01:18:50.411
Now leave me the fuck alone.

01:18:50.511 --> 01:18:52.854
Ah just about there.

01:18:52.954 --> 01:18:55.537
You see the guy got shanghaied.

01:18:56.665 --> 01:18:58.027
Um, in your face!

01:18:58.029 --> 01:18:59.073
In your face!

01:18:59.075 --> 01:19:02.669
You got shanghaied, bitch!

01:19:02.671 --> 01:19:04.315
Are you telling me,

01:19:04.317 --> 01:19:06.083
that you found the dowry up there

01:19:06.085 --> 01:19:07.667
and you just walked away from it?

01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:10.306
Nope, no dowry up there.

01:19:10.308 --> 01:19:11.650
Then what?

01:19:11.652 --> 01:19:15.929
Uh, you've read
Francesco's diary, right?

01:19:15.931 --> 01:19:19.317
The diary he wrote
about being shipwrecked.

01:19:19.319 --> 01:19:21.441
Well, it turns out there's
a twist in the story.

01:19:21.443 --> 01:19:23.516
You see Francesco didn't write the diary

01:19:23.518 --> 01:19:26.909
after being shipwrecked, he
wrote it on his first voyage,

01:19:26.911 --> 01:19:28.289
starting out from Spain.

01:19:28.291 --> 01:19:29.708
- Sarah.
- Day four.

01:19:30.730 --> 01:19:33.320
A storm has hit the Espadrillo once again.

01:19:33.322 --> 01:19:35.988
She's pushed the Espadrillo
deep into the rocks.

01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:37.573
My heart and I must abandon the wreck,

01:19:37.575 --> 01:19:40.420
and find better shelter on the island.

01:19:40.422 --> 01:19:42.400
You see the Espadrillo
didn't crash until

01:19:42.402 --> 01:19:46.537
two days after Francesco
threw the dowry overboard.

01:19:46.539 --> 01:19:48.380
Somewhere
across the Mediterranean.

01:19:48.382 --> 01:19:50.353
Now I told you before
about how he didn't invent

01:19:50.355 --> 01:19:53.299
daylight savings until
some time in the mid-1900s,

01:19:53.301 --> 01:19:57.134
so, we may have been a
tad early this morning.

01:19:58.354 --> 01:20:00.995
You see Francesco, didn't leave us a

01:20:00.997 --> 01:20:04.497
treasure at the tower, he left us the map.

01:20:07.226 --> 01:20:10.226
Now you tell me, isn't that a story.

01:20:14.532 --> 01:20:15.785
Yoohoo!

01:20:15.787 --> 01:20:19.168
Mmm!

01:20:19.170 --> 01:20:20.920
Well, good for you.

01:20:22.015 --> 01:20:23.922
But you're all crazy if you think you're

01:20:23.924 --> 01:20:25.841
gonna be rid of me now!

01:20:27.488 --> 01:20:30.968
I don't think that'll be a problem.

01:20:30.970 --> 01:20:32.387
Have a nice life.

01:20:34.319 --> 01:20:36.319
Nice knowing you Rick.

01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:38.499
If I ever see you again,

01:20:38.501 --> 01:20:42.668
I'm gonna fuck your shit up
son, I'm gonna fuck it up!

01:20:43.591 --> 01:20:46.067
Consider this a boost
to your motivation.

01:20:46.069 --> 01:20:49.592
My guess, you have an hour, maybe less.

01:22:12.846 --> 01:22:13.994
Dave.

01:22:13.996 --> 01:22:16.087
- Yep.
- What's a dowry?

01:22:16.089 --> 01:22:17.782
Oh my god!

01:22:17.784 --> 01:22:21.367
Seriously?

01:22:38.386 --> 01:22:39.419
Yes.

01:22:40.893 --> 01:22:44.461
Can you see much?

01:22:44.463 --> 01:22:47.130
It's hard, their proper small.

01:22:49.235 --> 01:22:50.891
Listening in on running

01:22:50.893 --> 01:22:53.247
the mill, run on the mill, hmm.

01:22:53.249 --> 01:22:54.258
Run of the mill,

01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:56.037
start again, no, can I go again?

01:22:56.039 --> 01:22:58.188
Running the mill,.

01:22:58.190 --> 01:22:59.416
Are you, are you rolling?

01:22:59.418 --> 01:23:00.418
Okay, great!

01:23:05.057 --> 01:23:06.147
Here,

01:23:06.149 --> 01:23:07.446
take it, it doesn't work anyway,

01:23:07.448 --> 01:23:09.469
don't have the PIN.

01:23:09.471 --> 01:23:11.582
Well, now it's not gonna work is it?

01:23:11.584 --> 01:23:12.991
Definitely not, no.

01:23:12.993 --> 01:23:15.400
Now give me back my wallet!
