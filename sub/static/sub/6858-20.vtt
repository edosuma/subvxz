WEBVTT

00:17.434 --> 00:19.435
ANNOUNCER: Trapped behind enemy lines!

00:19.811 --> 00:22.980
Carrying secret information
vital to the Republic's war effort,

00:23.106 --> 00:27.651
Jedi Master Even Piell and Captain Tarkin
were taken prisoner by the Separatists.

00:28.278 --> 00:32.031
An elite strike team, led by
Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker

00:32.115 --> 00:35.951
landed on the planet Lola Sayu
and infiltrated the prison.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.370
The team rescued Master Piell and Tarkin,

00:38.538 --> 00:42.207
but they were pursued by the prison's
evil commandant Osi Sobeck.

00:42.792 --> 00:45.461
During the escape,
their ship was destroyed.

00:45.795 --> 00:47.379
Now we find them on the run,

00:47.464 --> 00:50.466
desperate to escape the trap
that is the citadel.

00:56.139 --> 00:57.639
We're clear!

01:02.062 --> 01:03.145
What's our next move?

01:03.480 --> 01:05.647
We're going to have to
fight our way off this rock.

01:05.857 --> 01:09.026
Contact the Council,
see when they plan to rescue us.

01:09.360 --> 01:10.402
I'll handle it.

01:11.237 --> 01:12.237
(R2-D2 BEEPING)

01:14.699 --> 01:17.659
Master Piell, it's good to see you alive,
my friend.

01:17.702 --> 01:19.203
Likewise, Master Windu.

01:19.829 --> 01:21.997
Our escape route has been compromised

01:22.082 --> 01:25.375
and there are several squads of droids
closing in on us.

01:25.502 --> 01:27.002
When can we expect your arrival?

01:27.545 --> 01:29.546
Master Plo is already en route.

01:29.839 --> 01:32.925
Gunships will arrive
to evacuate you and your men,

01:33.343 --> 01:34.551
but do not delay,

01:34.761 --> 01:37.513
only a small window of opportunity
shall we have.

01:37.680 --> 01:40.349
Your rendezvous point will be this island.

01:41.559 --> 01:42.601
Understood.

01:43.061 --> 01:44.728
May the Force be with you.

01:52.403 --> 01:53.529
Incoming!

02:09.295 --> 02:10.921
No doubt there's more on the way.

02:24.727 --> 02:27.354
Count Dooku, My Lord.

02:27.814 --> 02:32.192
Commander Sobeck, you've been
avoiding my transmissions.

02:32.402 --> 02:35.154
My deepest respect.

02:35.280 --> 02:38.740
I was hoping to surprise you
with good news.

02:39.075 --> 02:42.452
Good news would indeed be a surprise.

02:44.122 --> 02:45.873
Have the prisoners been captured?

02:46.332 --> 02:47.708
Not yet, My Lord.

02:48.251 --> 02:52.004
But we've located their position
and my droids are moving in now.

02:52.505 --> 02:57.467
I need not remind you that the prisoners
are carrying secret hyperspace coordinates

02:57.552 --> 03:03.056
into the core systems of the Republic
and our Separatist home worlds.

03:03.308 --> 03:07.186
This information will allow us to launch
a surprise attack on Coruscant,

03:07.478 --> 03:12.065
striking a crippling blow to the Republic
and the Jedi.

03:12.692 --> 03:17.404
Yes, My Lord. I will see to it
that they are soon back in our possession.

03:18.281 --> 03:20.240
You should know, Commander,

03:20.408 --> 03:24.286
right now your honesty is the only thing
keeping you alive.

03:40.595 --> 03:41.845
They're boxing us in!

03:42.138 --> 03:43.847
Lock in your cables!

03:44.057 --> 03:47.809
Artoo, we need your droids
to hold off the enemy as long as possible.

03:47.894 --> 03:48.894
(BEEPING AFFIRMATIVELY)

03:49.187 --> 03:51.563
Good. Everybody, follow me!

03:51.898 --> 03:53.440
This is sheer madness!

03:59.906 --> 04:01.323
(R2-D2 BEEPING)

04:01.366 --> 04:02.491
We understand, sir.

04:02.575 --> 04:04.993
We will delay the enemy
as long as possible.

04:05.119 --> 04:06.119
(BEEPING)

04:07.288 --> 04:08.872
Prepare for attack.

04:09.415 --> 04:11.917
It was an honor to serve under you, sir.

04:12.669 --> 04:13.961
(BEEPING AFFIRMATIVELY)

04:15.129 --> 04:16.296
Keep moving!

04:16.714 --> 04:19.549
All for one and one for...

04:22.345 --> 04:24.012
(CLONES SCREAMING)

04:36.818 --> 04:38.777
Keep moving, keep moving!

04:55.211 --> 04:58.338
Master Tiin, you should be leading
the fighter attack.

04:58.881 --> 05:01.133
Once you punch a hole
through their defenses,

05:01.301 --> 05:04.845
I will lead the gunships down to the surface
and extract the team.

05:05.346 --> 05:07.848
Depending on the size of their force,

05:08.141 --> 05:10.726
I don't know how much time
we can buy you.

05:11.227 --> 05:13.228
You will do your best, I'm sure.

05:13.813 --> 05:16.940
If the team isn't at the extraction point
when you arrive,

05:17.025 --> 05:20.861
you may be forced to leave them,
or put us all at risk.

05:21.362 --> 05:24.156
I'm afraid Master Gallia is right.

05:24.699 --> 05:25.991
They'll be there.

05:27.910 --> 05:31.413
The prisoners have evaded us long enough.

05:31.914 --> 05:36.126
Bring out the anoobas!
Use them for tracking only!

05:38.254 --> 05:39.671
(GROWLING)

05:42.133 --> 05:44.259
(HOWLING)

05:50.266 --> 05:54.019
Contact me as soon as the fugitives
have been located.

05:54.145 --> 05:55.228
Roger, roger.

06:08.159 --> 06:11.578
What if your Jedi friends are not there
when we arrive?

06:11.913 --> 06:15.123
Keep moving and you won't
have to worry about that, Tarkin.

06:18.961 --> 06:22.714
Why did Master Piell have to share
half of the intel with that guy?

06:22.924 --> 06:25.300
It's like he's not even grateful
we rescued him.

06:25.551 --> 06:27.928
Captain Tarkin feels the Jedi should be

06:28.304 --> 06:30.430
relieved from the burden
of leading the war effort.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.391
That's ridiculous.

06:32.642 --> 06:36.269
Maybe, but we aren't soldiers,
we're peacekeepers.

06:36.854 --> 06:40.232
The Jedi code often prevents us from
going far enough to achieve victory.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.692
A rather simple point of view.

06:43.152 --> 06:45.487
Either way, he is a good captain.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.406
(DISTANT HOWLING)

06:48.741 --> 06:49.783
Did you hear that?

06:49.867 --> 06:53.036
Yes. We're going to have company.

07:08.386 --> 07:12.347
Commander, the additional reinforcements
have arrived.

07:12.723 --> 07:15.016
Tighten your grip, K2-B4.

07:15.601 --> 07:18.520
The Republic will almost certainly attempt
a second mission

07:18.688 --> 07:22.607
to infiltrate our defenses
and rescue the prisoners.

07:23.192 --> 07:28.071
I'm counting on you to ensure
that nothing slips past our blockade.

07:35.705 --> 07:38.540
You know, it's not wise
to argue with Master Piell.

07:38.624 --> 07:39.624
(CHUCKLES)

07:39.709 --> 07:41.751
It's certainly not a good career move.

07:41.919 --> 07:46.256
General Skywalker,
I stand by my principles. No matter what.

07:46.549 --> 07:49.384
Besides, I needn't worry about my career.

07:49.552 --> 07:51.386
I've fallen into favor with the Chancellor.

07:53.431 --> 07:54.723
He shall support me.

07:55.683 --> 07:58.101
I happen to know the Chancellor
quite well, myself.

07:58.561 --> 08:00.479
Oh... Really?

08:01.272 --> 08:02.355
Really.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.024
Let's keep moving.

08:04.066 --> 08:07.360
If we're not at the rendezvous
at the exact time, we'll miss our window.

08:10.615 --> 08:11.907
(ANOOBAS APPROACHING)

08:12.074 --> 08:13.241
Those creatures are gaining.

08:14.410 --> 08:17.913
If they've caught our scent,
they'll lead the droids right to us.

08:18.247 --> 08:19.873
We're gonna have to deal with them.

08:20.082 --> 08:22.250
What about using this cave
to surprise them?

08:23.085 --> 08:26.546
If we can get them to pass by,
we can attack them from behind.

08:26.714 --> 08:28.381
But we need a distraction.

08:28.716 --> 08:30.133
Leave that to me.

08:30.218 --> 08:31.218
(CLEARS THROAT)

08:31.594 --> 08:33.094
And Obi-Wan, of course.

11:40.783 --> 11:43.535
No. Don't leave.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.705
Listen to me carefully, child.

11:47.123 --> 11:52.127
The information, I need you to
deliver it back to the Council.

11:52.294 --> 11:54.587
I should find Anakin or Obi-Wan.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.297
They need to hear this.

11:56.465 --> 11:59.718
No. You must listen.

11:59.927 --> 12:01.970
But I wasn't assigned to the team.

12:02.304 --> 12:04.806
I lied just so I could be
a part of the mission.

12:05.099 --> 12:08.810
Whether you were meant to be
on this mission or not,

12:08.936 --> 12:12.397
you are now the most important part of it.

12:13.107 --> 12:15.066
Remember this.

12:15.317 --> 12:18.987
And see to it that the information
I'm about to give you

12:19.071 --> 12:23.658
is revealed to no one but the Jedi Council.

12:28.956 --> 12:33.126
Sir! The anoobas have located the fugitives
along the northern shore.

12:33.335 --> 12:37.672
Squad, come with me!
I will deal with this personally.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.806
So much for the hunting party.

12:47.183 --> 12:48.808
There are more squads on their way.

12:51.479 --> 12:52.520
Oh, no.

13:12.541 --> 13:14.167
He died honorably.

13:15.753 --> 13:17.003
What about the information?

13:17.755 --> 13:20.423
I have it. He told me just before he died.

13:29.099 --> 13:31.226
We don't have much time.

13:31.352 --> 13:35.396
Let's take this moment to honor him,
then we must move on.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.899
He would have wanted us
to complete our mission.

14:37.126 --> 14:41.796
There have not been battles like these
since the days of the Old Republic.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.592
Indeed. Good hunting.

So should the rest of the Separatist army!

Of Master Piell's loss, we are sorry to hear.

He will be missed.

Because of his great sacrifice,
we now have the Nexus Route coordinates.

Captain Tarkin and Ahsoka
have each memorized half.

19:47.060 --> 19:48.686

19:49.271 --> 19:51.772
With all due respect, Master Jedi,

19:51.899 --> 19:53.941
I was instructed by Chancellor Palpatine

19:54.067 --> 19:56.777
to bring the intel directly to him
for debriefing.

19:57.029 --> 20:00.865
I promised Master Piell that
I would deliver it only to the Council.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.242
And that's what I will do.

20:04.286 --> 20:05.286
Hmm...

20:05.412 --> 20:10.291
Personally meet with the Chancellor, I will.
Decide what is best to do, we shall.

20:12.794 --> 20:15.213
Master Plo, there's something
we want to ask you.

20:16.131 --> 20:17.965
Did you assign Ahsoka to the mission?

20:22.888 --> 20:24.263
It appears I did.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.274
A job well done, General Skywalker.

20:39.446 --> 20:42.907
I wish more Jedi
had your military sensibilities.

20:45.911 --> 20:48.663
Perhaps I can inform the Chancellor
of your valor.

20:50.332 --> 20:53.292
I'm not sure what to think of your new ally.

20:53.919 --> 20:56.629
Well, I think we need people like him.

20:57.005 --> 21:00.675
This is a war. If we aren't willing to do
what it takes to win,

21:01.426 --> 21:03.678
we risk losing everything we try to protect.

21:04.304 --> 21:07.932
Unfortunately, war tends to distort
our point of view.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.686
If we sacrifice our code, even for victory,

21:12.354 --> 21:16.357
we may lose that which is most important,
our honor.
