WEBVTT

00:02.170 --> 00:03.880
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

00:04.047 --> 00:06.925
<i>Cops aren't gonna let you
within 100 feet of Galavan.</i>

00:07.092 --> 00:08.093
Let us whack him for you.

00:08.301 --> 00:09.344
No.

00:09.928 --> 00:10.929
He's mine.

00:11.096 --> 00:12.222
Shoot him, Detective.

00:12.389 --> 00:13.598
He killed my mother, Jim.

00:19.270 --> 00:20.563
Do you have the Wayne boy?

00:20.730 --> 00:24.317
Not yet. There are some practical matters
that have to be resolved first.

00:24.484 --> 00:26.361
See this finger?

00:26.528 --> 00:28.947
I've got little Bruce
wrapped tight around it.

00:29.114 --> 00:31.116
I had to kill him. Because he hit you.

00:31.324 --> 00:32.617
I love you.

00:34.202 --> 00:37.622
Kristen.
Kristen? No!

00:38.289 --> 00:41.251
Within a year,
Jim and I will be back together.

00:41.459 --> 00:42.877
Wanna know why?

00:43.044 --> 00:44.671
Because we're both the same.

00:45.088 --> 00:47.298
We both have a dark side.

01:12.991 --> 01:15.285
Ready for the practice run?

01:15.452 --> 01:17.495
I'm ready to skip this and get married.

01:17.662 --> 01:18.830
Me, too.

01:18.997 --> 01:21.082
Let us rehearse the vows.

01:24.836 --> 01:26.337
- Barbara Kean...
- Mmm.

01:26.504 --> 01:28.256
Do you take James Gordon

01:28.423 --> 01:31.509
to be your unlawfully wedded husband,
to have and to hold--

01:31.676 --> 01:35.263
I'm sorry.
Father, you said "unlawfully" wedded.

01:37.182 --> 01:40.185
Barbara,
just answer him, for God's sake!

01:45.064 --> 01:46.107
I'm waiting.

01:55.950 --> 01:57.744
Barbara, what's wrong?

02:05.293 --> 02:07.462
How did you do that?

02:43.623 --> 02:44.999
Bad dream.

03:24.539 --> 03:27.083
Doesn't being mayor mean you can sleep in?

03:29.627 --> 03:32.797
Jim Gordon has forced us
to accelerate our plans.

03:32.964 --> 03:34.424
About time.

03:34.591 --> 03:36.718
I meet with Bruce Wayne this morning.

03:36.885 --> 03:39.888
If all goes well, I'll have his company
by the end of the day.

03:40.054 --> 03:43.808
I still don't see how you can get Bruce
Wayne to turn over his family's legacy.

03:44.225 --> 03:45.560
You're not that charming.

03:48.855 --> 03:51.816
I'm going to offer him the thing
he wants most in the world.

03:52.775 --> 03:54.152
Still...

03:55.194 --> 03:56.738
It will be delicate.

03:57.447 --> 04:00.116
<i>Jim Gordon
must not be allowed to interfere.</i>

04:00.867 --> 04:04.078
But his sudden death would upset Bruce.

04:04.245 --> 04:07.081
So we need him distracted, occupied.

04:08.207 --> 04:11.044
- And then...
- Have you told her?

04:11.252 --> 04:12.921
Told me what?

04:19.135 --> 04:21.137
I love my present.

04:24.182 --> 04:26.184
Does it mean what I think it does?

04:26.684 --> 04:28.102
Yes, my dear.

04:28.853 --> 04:33.691
Today is the day
you get to kill Jim Gordon.

04:37.195 --> 04:38.488
<i>The breakout at Arkham.</i>

04:38.696 --> 04:40.198
<i>The massacre at the G.C.P.D.</i>

04:40.490 --> 04:42.867
The gala. The arsons.

04:43.368 --> 04:45.745
It was Galavan. He's behind everything.

04:46.454 --> 04:47.705
And you have proof of this?

04:47.872 --> 04:49.624
I have Penguin and I have Gilzean.

04:49.791 --> 04:51.501
Both criminals. Both in the wind.

04:51.709 --> 04:55.505
Given the circumstances
under which I obtained the information,

04:55.672 --> 04:57.674
I think it's safe to say
they were telling the truth.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.133
Maybe they are.

04:59.300 --> 05:03.346
But you have no legal evidence, no proof,
not a single, hard lead to go on.

05:03.513 --> 05:06.015
You bring in Galavan with what you
have now, and he'll just laugh at you.

05:06.182 --> 05:07.934
He won't laugh long.

05:08.518 --> 05:10.061
What, are you gonna rough him up a little?

05:10.228 --> 05:12.438
A little lawless thuggery?
Is that your plan?

05:13.272 --> 05:15.024
You want to arrest Galavan?

05:15.191 --> 05:18.069
You do the police work
and you bring me back some real proof.

05:20.905 --> 05:22.198
Can you blame him?

05:22.365 --> 05:24.951
You're going after a man
who was elected mayor yesterday.

05:25.118 --> 05:26.494
The most popular figure in Gotham.

05:26.661 --> 05:28.538
Galavan is dirty. I'd bet my life on it.

05:28.705 --> 05:30.081
- Well, don't.
- Don't what?

05:30.248 --> 05:31.874
- Don't bet your life on it.
- Oh.

05:32.208 --> 05:36.254
I know that look in your eye, Jim.
Be cool. Do not make this personal.

05:36.421 --> 05:38.214
Well, it is personal, isn't it?

05:38.381 --> 05:39.424
Only if you make it that way.

05:39.590 --> 05:42.719
<i>Suspect! Put your hands
where I can see 'em! Right there!</i>

05:48.474 --> 05:49.642
Hi, Jim.

05:54.439 --> 05:55.982
Long time no see.

06:17.962 --> 06:19.464
You said you'd only talk to me.

06:21.215 --> 06:22.467
<i>I'm listening.</i>

06:23.634 --> 06:24.677
<i>Yes.</i>

06:26.304 --> 06:27.513
Here it is...

06:31.142 --> 06:32.935
Is there any chance I could get
a latte or something?

06:33.102 --> 06:35.730
- This is not a game, Barbara.
- Oh...

06:36.647 --> 06:38.107
Of course it is.

06:39.650 --> 06:41.486
It's a game you've been losing.

06:42.695 --> 06:44.113
Big time.

06:47.366 --> 06:49.827
It is not a game.

06:51.954 --> 06:53.581
It must be killing you.

06:54.832 --> 06:58.419
All that righteous indignation
with no place to go.

07:05.635 --> 07:07.178
Why are you here?

07:08.137 --> 07:10.431
Don't act all calm and businesslike.

07:12.141 --> 07:13.518
Rough me up a little.

07:14.352 --> 07:15.978
If you want.

07:19.023 --> 07:20.566
I don't wanna do that.

07:25.279 --> 07:26.614
<i>I don't want to hurt you.</i>

07:27.782 --> 07:29.033
<i>I want to help you.</i>

07:30.535 --> 07:33.996
I know you want to hurt me.

07:35.790 --> 07:36.958
Just a little.

07:40.419 --> 07:43.005
- I've been a very bad girl.
- No.

07:46.717 --> 07:48.136
You're a good woman.

07:51.013 --> 07:52.807
You're just sick, is all.

08:29.468 --> 08:30.720
I knew it.

08:32.305 --> 08:34.640
I knew you still had feelings for me.

08:38.102 --> 08:40.021
Of course I have feelings.

08:42.815 --> 08:44.192
Talk to me.

08:45.860 --> 08:46.986
I will.

08:48.946 --> 08:50.948
But first, I want to show you something.

08:52.158 --> 08:53.951
It's not far away, it won't take long.

08:54.118 --> 08:56.829
What is it? What do you want to show me?

08:58.581 --> 08:59.957
It's a surprise.

09:01.167 --> 09:03.127
Don't worry, it's a good one.

09:04.545 --> 09:08.299
And then, after that,
I will tell you everything.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.052
Everything about what?

09:11.928 --> 09:13.512
Is it about the breakout at Arkham?

09:13.679 --> 09:14.764
Was it Galavan?

09:16.766 --> 09:18.434
Wouldn't you like to know?

09:20.853 --> 09:22.313
<i>Detective Gordon!</i>

09:24.357 --> 09:27.693
Okay, that's someone telling you
that my lawyer is here.

09:27.860 --> 09:30.488
Why don't you take five minutes
and think about it?

09:32.323 --> 09:34.533
<i>Detective Gordon! Time is up!</i>

10:08.359 --> 10:10.528
What is she playing at?

10:10.695 --> 10:11.946
<i>Not sure, sir.</i>

10:12.196 --> 10:13.948
I suggest we play along and find out.

10:14.115 --> 10:15.950
I'll go see this thing
she wants to show me.

10:16.117 --> 10:17.576
Jim, she's mentally ill.

10:17.868 --> 10:20.871
Like hell! She's sharp as a nail.
This is a trap.

10:21.038 --> 10:22.581
Yeah. Either way, it's too risky.

10:22.748 --> 10:26.043
What choice do we have, huh?
She won't talk.

10:26.210 --> 10:27.712
And kissing her didn't work out, did it?

10:27.878 --> 10:29.672
That was a judgment call, sir.

10:29.839 --> 10:33.342
- Judgment? Really?
- Let's focus on the issue at hand.

10:34.468 --> 10:37.263
It's my official opinion
as Chief Medical Examiner

10:37.430 --> 10:40.349
that Miss Kean is seriously mentally ill

10:40.516 --> 10:42.310
and should be in a hospital
getting treatment.

10:42.476 --> 10:44.145
Yes. Tomorrow.

10:46.522 --> 10:47.815
Look.

10:47.982 --> 10:51.819
I suggest we play along,
let her think she's in control.

10:52.028 --> 10:55.489
<i>I can still work on her inside the car.
Maybe I can find out something useful.</i>

10:56.365 --> 10:58.409
She's our only link to Galavan.

10:58.909 --> 11:00.661
<i>It's worth the risk.</i>

11:01.704 --> 11:02.747
All right. Do it.

12:17.029 --> 12:18.906
Whoa, sorry, Miss Kringle.

12:29.125 --> 12:30.835
You have a visitor, Miss St. Cloud.

12:33.170 --> 12:34.713
- Hi.
<i>- Hello.</i>

12:43.431 --> 12:45.224
My uncle will be just a moment.

12:45.724 --> 12:47.852
He wanted me to apologize
for keeping you waiting.

12:48.727 --> 12:49.728
It's fine.

12:51.439 --> 12:53.357
Do you have any idea
why he wanted to see me?

12:54.024 --> 12:56.026
He told me he had something for you.

12:56.569 --> 12:59.238
- He seemed excited.
- It was totally goofy.

12:59.405 --> 13:00.573
I can't picture him goofy.

13:00.739 --> 13:03.033
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

13:03.701 --> 13:05.202
I'll see you later.

13:05.369 --> 13:06.454
Bye.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.208
Please.

13:29.018 --> 13:31.353
Meet the new crop
of Strike Force members.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.772
We're throwing them in the deep end,
but they're ready.

13:33.939 --> 13:36.233
They'll be shadowing you in a TAC SUV.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.110
I'll be monitoring from here.

13:38.277 --> 13:41.405
Now, the second I don't like something,
I'm pulling the plug. Agreed?

13:41.572 --> 13:42.865
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

13:44.408 --> 13:45.409
<i>Gordon?</i>

13:46.994 --> 13:47.995
Agreed.

13:51.332 --> 13:53.751
He's too wrapped up
in this thing emotionally.

13:54.084 --> 13:57.379
I need to know that one of you isn't gonna
get sucked into all these mind games

13:57.546 --> 13:59.089
that Miss Kean is gonna
be pulling out there.

13:59.298 --> 14:02.927
Not to worry. No one's ever accused me
of getting sucked into mind games.

14:03.302 --> 14:05.137
Just follow my orders. Understood?

14:05.304 --> 14:08.265
Understood, Captain.
I'm glad we had this chance to talk.

14:09.934 --> 14:13.103
Lee, look, I don't like this
any more than you do.

14:13.270 --> 14:14.396
But it is the only way.

14:14.605 --> 14:17.650
No. This is you, Jim. This is all you.

14:17.816 --> 14:19.360
She sucked you right back in, didn't she?

14:19.527 --> 14:21.612
Because she still has a hold on you.

14:22.321 --> 14:24.573
Her sickness and yours
feed off each other.

14:24.740 --> 14:25.991
What do you mean, "my sickness"?
I'm not sick.

14:26.200 --> 14:28.369
You see an abyss, and you run toward it.

14:28.577 --> 14:29.912
That's not healthy.

14:31.622 --> 14:32.665
I'm just doing my job.

14:32.831 --> 14:34.041
<i>We're moving out!</i>

14:38.671 --> 14:42.341
Hey, Lee. You don't mind if I borrow him
for a little while, do ya?

14:49.473 --> 14:51.141
I want to ask you a question.

14:52.351 --> 14:56.647
If you could have one dream come true,
what would that be?

14:57.815 --> 15:00.234
I would find the man
who killed my parents.

15:00.401 --> 15:02.820
What would you do if you found him?

15:04.905 --> 15:06.323
I would kill him.

15:07.116 --> 15:08.951
What a young tiger you are.

15:13.664 --> 15:14.957
My dream?

15:16.333 --> 15:17.793
I would save this city.

15:20.129 --> 15:24.383
I would rid Gotham of corruption,
crime and poverty.

15:25.134 --> 15:26.343
Sounds good.

15:27.886 --> 15:29.388
How would you do that?

15:29.555 --> 15:33.517
Oh, I have plans, schemes, ideas aplenty.

15:34.435 --> 15:36.895
But I need help.

15:38.689 --> 15:40.357
I need your help.

15:40.858 --> 15:41.900
Of course.

15:42.276 --> 15:46.697
And perhaps, in return,
I could help you with your dream.

15:50.993 --> 15:52.077
How so?

15:55.122 --> 15:57.249
<i>Get those vehicles out of the way!</i>

16:05.633 --> 16:06.634
You good?

16:06.800 --> 16:10.596
Anything that makes Captain Barnes'
tight ass nervous, I'm all for.

16:12.514 --> 16:13.766
Watch your head!

16:19.063 --> 16:21.940
So, you want to tell us where we're going?

16:22.566 --> 16:24.234
Head downtown.

16:38.165 --> 16:40.167
Bruce, your family helped build this city.

16:40.334 --> 16:44.963
The Wayne name is synonymous with growth,
strength and prosperity.

16:46.215 --> 16:47.466
It's also a lie.

16:49.718 --> 16:50.928
Please explain what you mean.

16:51.845 --> 16:55.182
I've been investigating Wayne Enterprises
for quite some time.

16:56.100 --> 16:57.434
You know what I found?

16:58.477 --> 16:59.937
Toxic waste dumps,

17:01.105 --> 17:04.733
illegal weapons contracts,
use of banned chemicals,

17:05.109 --> 17:06.944
nightmarish experiments.

17:08.445 --> 17:12.741
It can't continue. Please understand,
this isn't about corruption.

17:13.826 --> 17:15.369
It's about saving innocent lives.

17:17.746 --> 17:21.166
You have my word,
I will look into all of it.

17:21.333 --> 17:23.043
And I will stop whoever's responsible.

17:23.210 --> 17:24.336
No, Bruce. You won't.

17:25.421 --> 17:26.964
You can't.

17:27.631 --> 17:29.967
People often underestimate me.

17:30.676 --> 17:34.513
Wayne Enterprises
is a multibillion-dollar conglomerate

17:34.680 --> 17:37.850
with a board that will kill
to protect its secrets.

17:38.559 --> 17:40.519
Who's underestimating who?

17:44.148 --> 17:45.983
Why are you telling me this?

17:46.150 --> 17:48.819
You obviously have a solution
you want to propose.

17:51.613 --> 17:55.617
You control 51%
of the voting shares of Wayne Enterprises.

17:56.744 --> 17:59.913
If you sell me your shares,
I could take control.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.623
Do what needs to be done.

18:01.790 --> 18:04.835
You would be a cash billionaire
with freedom.

18:06.295 --> 18:07.588
You want my company?

18:08.255 --> 18:10.382
I want to clean up Gotham.

18:10.549 --> 18:12.217
Protect its citizens.

18:13.177 --> 18:17.556
Return this city to what it was.
But I can't do it without your help.

18:21.685 --> 18:23.520
Wayne Enterprises is my responsibility.

18:26.648 --> 18:28.400
It's all I have left of them.

18:30.694 --> 18:33.197
I'm not just offering you money, Bruce.

18:36.283 --> 18:38.368
The night your parents were killed,

18:38.994 --> 18:41.038
you weren't supposed to be there,
were you?

18:41.872 --> 18:43.123
No.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.334
Your parents were headed for the theater.

18:45.501 --> 18:48.253
Your father changed his mind,
suggested a movie.

18:48.420 --> 18:50.547
Invited you along.

18:51.006 --> 18:52.132
You got there late.

18:54.218 --> 18:55.844
I've never told anybody that.

18:56.220 --> 18:58.555
He was following your father that night.

18:59.848 --> 19:01.558
Before the alleyway.

19:01.725 --> 19:05.938
I'm a man of considerable resources and,
even then, it took some doing.

19:07.147 --> 19:08.899
That's why I didn't want
to say anything last night.

19:09.066 --> 19:11.443
I couldn't confirm it until today.

19:12.236 --> 19:14.363
If you sell me your company,

19:17.407 --> 19:19.785
I will give you this as a signing gift.

19:21.787 --> 19:25.082
This is the name of the man
who killed your parents.

19:26.041 --> 19:27.251
<i>With documentary proof.</i>

19:27.417 --> 19:31.922
<i>Accomplices, motives, why, how, and who.</i>

19:34.049 --> 19:40.430
I will fix your company,
protect your legacy, and give you closure.

19:41.640 --> 19:44.142
It's what your father would have wanted.

19:44.810 --> 19:47.521
<i>And what Gotham desperately needs.</i>

19:55.445 --> 19:57.447
I need your answer by the end of the day.

20:05.455 --> 20:08.333
<i>Hey, Jim. Cheer up!</i>

20:08.709 --> 20:10.627
Where's your spirit of adventure?

20:11.628 --> 20:12.713
Next right.

20:20.637 --> 20:22.097
I know it's a trap.

20:24.099 --> 20:26.184
And Galavan's using you like a puppet.

20:27.936 --> 20:30.647
It is Galavan
who's behind all this, right?

20:31.189 --> 20:32.900
Mmm, mmm, mmm!

20:33.066 --> 20:34.943
He's a psychopath, Barbara.

20:35.110 --> 20:36.820
He's using you.

20:38.572 --> 20:40.198
He's laughing at you.

20:41.241 --> 20:45.495
And when he's done with you,
you're just a loose end. He'll kill you.

20:47.164 --> 20:49.917
You really don't like
this Galavan guy, do you?

20:51.126 --> 20:55.213
She's not talking, Jim.
We need to turn this car around. Now.

20:55.505 --> 20:57.257
Just give me a little more time.

21:10.437 --> 21:11.438
Hmm.

21:22.866 --> 21:26.119
Well, I'm afraid this is
as proper a burial as circumstances allow.

21:26.870 --> 21:29.414
But I thought we could have
one last meal together.

21:32.376 --> 21:34.378
I was a broken man, Miss Kringle.

21:35.045 --> 21:37.130
Two halves at war with each other.

21:37.297 --> 21:40.717
But thanks to you, I am whole.

21:42.886 --> 21:44.388
I will not forget you.

21:46.515 --> 21:48.725
I take you by night, by day take you back.

21:49.309 --> 21:51.728
None suffer to have me,
but do from my lack.

21:52.270 --> 21:53.563
What am I?

21:53.730 --> 21:55.232
That some sort of riddle?

21:56.608 --> 21:58.986
You know, you really shouldn't sneak up
on people. That's not polite.

21:59.361 --> 22:01.405
Not usually any people out here.

22:01.571 --> 22:03.156
Can I interest you in a tea sandwich?

22:03.323 --> 22:04.533
A what?

22:06.410 --> 22:08.578
What the heck is in there?

22:19.589 --> 22:20.757
Great.

22:21.675 --> 22:23.218
Now I've got to improvise.

22:24.928 --> 22:26.555
Don't go anywhere.

22:39.735 --> 22:41.278
Barbara, listen to me.

22:42.446 --> 22:44.114
Are you listening?

22:44.281 --> 22:47.534
You have a lifetime ahead of you.
Don't throw it away on madness.

22:51.288 --> 22:53.415
<i>Gordon. Bullock. Come in.</i>

22:54.499 --> 22:55.625
Go ahead, Captain.

22:55.792 --> 22:58.211
<i>I don't like this. You're boxed in.
There's lots of cover.</i>

22:58.378 --> 23:00.047
<i>High vantage points all around.</i>

23:00.213 --> 23:01.798
Perfect spot for an ambush.

23:02.215 --> 23:04.176
<i>Yeah, I gotta pull you out.</i>

23:04.342 --> 23:06.636
You turn around, you get nothing.

23:08.555 --> 23:09.556
<i>Not yet.</i>

23:09.723 --> 23:11.767
<i>You hear me?
I'm pulling you out.</i>

23:12.350 --> 23:13.602
What was that, Captain?
You're breaking up.

23:13.769 --> 23:16.605
<i>Bullock! I swear to God, if you disobey--</i>

23:17.647 --> 23:20.317
Barbara, think hard.
Don't throw away your life.

23:20.859 --> 23:22.152
What life?

23:25.697 --> 23:28.408
You and me, we had a life.

23:31.161 --> 23:32.788
We had real love.

23:35.332 --> 23:37.084
You asked me to marry you.

23:38.001 --> 23:40.796
I booked a church.
I bought a damn wedding dress.

23:41.546 --> 23:44.049
Jim, fool that I am,

23:44.966 --> 23:47.302
I still love you, even now.

23:48.804 --> 23:52.140
And I know you still have feelings for me,
'cause you said so.

23:52.307 --> 23:55.143
We can talk about our feelings later.
There's more at stake here.

23:56.019 --> 23:57.354
I love you, Jim.

23:59.439 --> 24:03.735
And I think, deep down, you still love me.

24:04.027 --> 24:06.363
Oh, for God's sakes, Barbara,
I don't give a--

24:12.702 --> 24:14.329
Move! Move!

25:11.595 --> 25:13.597
You gonna shoot me, Jim?

25:23.523 --> 25:25.108
I want a 20-block perimeter

25:25.275 --> 25:28.111
with hard-target searches
of every building, business, and bodega.

25:28.278 --> 25:31.114
We kick down everything
with four walls and a roof.

25:31.281 --> 25:32.908
Nobody sleeps until our boy gets home.

25:33.074 --> 25:36.453
Hey! I told you to get out of here.

25:36.620 --> 25:39.873
You did? There's still a lot of ringing
in my head. I must have missed it.

25:40.040 --> 25:41.416
This is a direct order.

25:41.583 --> 25:44.544
You don't belong here anymore. Go home.

26:01.311 --> 26:02.312
Yeah.

26:03.688 --> 26:05.106
Oh, okay.

26:06.942 --> 26:08.860
Well, let's see.

26:10.195 --> 26:12.530
If I can't make the hole bigger,

26:12.822 --> 26:15.450
then I'll make you smaller.

26:27.254 --> 26:29.422
Who has eaten my sandwich?

26:36.263 --> 26:39.349
For a secluded forest,
this place sure has a lot of foot traffic.

26:42.519 --> 26:45.397
Looks like it's gonna get
a tad crowded in there.

26:49.025 --> 26:50.443
I'll be back.

27:01.329 --> 27:05.041
Oh, there you are, Master Bruce.
Been looking all over the gaff for you.

27:05.709 --> 27:07.669
Bit dreary down here, isn't it?

27:08.712 --> 27:10.338
Fancy something to eat?

27:12.382 --> 27:13.717
What's up?

27:14.759 --> 27:16.469
I need to ask you a question.

27:18.263 --> 27:20.223
And I need your word
that you're gonna be honest with me.

27:20.390 --> 27:21.891
I always am.

27:25.103 --> 27:26.688
All right, you have my word.

27:26.980 --> 27:28.231
My training.

27:29.899 --> 27:33.862
The skills that I need to take down
the corruption at Wayne Enterprises.

27:34.446 --> 27:35.822
How long will it take?

27:36.448 --> 27:39.743
Well, there's no set timeline.
Doesn't really work like that, does it?

27:39.909 --> 27:43.413
Alfred, a year? Two years? Five?

27:43.913 --> 27:47.250
Well, a lot longer than that,
for you to be the man that you need to be.

27:47.917 --> 27:50.086
<i>But you will get there.
I promise you that.</i>

27:50.503 --> 27:53.256
Yeah, well, how many will suffer
in the meantime?

27:54.090 --> 27:57.635
How many will die because of the crimes
committed by my family's company?

28:01.890 --> 28:04.934
Where is all this coming from,
Master Bruce? Eh?

28:12.275 --> 28:13.568
I spoke to

28:15.278 --> 28:16.905
Mayor Galavan this morning.

28:17.072 --> 28:18.114
And?

28:22.827 --> 28:26.289
He wants me to sell him my shares
of Wayne Enterprises so he can

28:27.290 --> 28:30.794
fix the company, clean up Gotham.

28:33.254 --> 28:34.422
I see.

28:37.592 --> 28:39.344
And what aren't you telling me?

28:43.014 --> 28:44.182
He says...

28:46.976 --> 28:49.729
That he knows the identity of the man
who killed my parents.

28:51.523 --> 28:54.484
Which he's offering in return
for the company, right?

28:57.195 --> 28:58.488
Yes.

28:58.655 --> 29:01.324
Yeah, well, that's not an offer, is it?

29:01.491 --> 29:03.118
That's bloody extortion.

29:03.284 --> 29:05.578
Yeah, well, I can't help
but consider it, Alfred.

29:05.745 --> 29:06.746
Well, you shouldn't.

29:06.913 --> 29:10.750
There's a fine line
between extortion and negotiation.

29:10.917 --> 29:13.586
Yes, there is, Master Bruce.
But there's still a line.

29:13.753 --> 29:15.380
My parents were killed

29:16.047 --> 29:18.967
because of the corruption
that my father was trying to stop.

29:20.343 --> 29:22.387
As of now, their deaths have been in vain.

29:22.554 --> 29:24.806
But if Mayor Galavan can truly...

29:26.266 --> 29:27.809
If he can truly fix Wayne Enterprises,

29:27.976 --> 29:33.440
isn't it my moral duty
to allow him to do so?

29:36.109 --> 29:37.735
For my father's legacy?

29:40.572 --> 29:43.867
Wayne Enterprises isn't
Thomas and Martha Wayne's legacy.

29:47.537 --> 29:49.706
That legacy is standing right here.

29:51.207 --> 29:52.667
With me.

30:01.718 --> 30:04.929
Alfred, am I wrong
if I just want it all to be over?

30:05.221 --> 30:07.807
I just want... I just want it to be over.

30:09.225 --> 30:10.894
No, no. No, you're not wrong.

30:12.187 --> 30:13.396
Come here.

30:15.273 --> 30:16.733
You're not wrong.

30:57.732 --> 30:58.816
I know.

30:59.567 --> 31:01.903
Can you believe it still fits?

31:07.116 --> 31:11.538
Do you remember
when we first visited this place?

31:12.872 --> 31:16.793
How excited I was to get married here?

31:19.754 --> 31:22.715
How long do you think you have
before the G.C.P.D. finds us?

31:22.924 --> 31:24.175
So typical.

31:25.051 --> 31:30.473
I'm talking about us,
and your head is in work.

31:30.640 --> 31:31.766
There is no "us."

31:33.768 --> 31:35.311
What is all this?

31:36.980 --> 31:40.400
Well, this is my wedding dress.
The tailor still had it in storage.

31:40.567 --> 31:44.737
I mean, can you believe the luck? Or fate.

31:46.239 --> 31:47.949
That's Father Callahan.

31:48.116 --> 31:49.617
You remember him, of course.

31:49.784 --> 31:51.953
And these bozos...

31:54.664 --> 31:57.625
Who knows? But you can't have
a wedding without witnesses.

31:58.167 --> 31:59.335
That's the law.

32:01.421 --> 32:02.547
Barbara...

32:03.089 --> 32:04.299
Jim,

32:05.633 --> 32:08.469
please don't act all surprised
and aggrieved.

32:10.179 --> 32:14.517
You knew from the start
that this was a trap.

32:15.810 --> 32:20.481
But you thought, "Hey, let the bad guys
take their best shot.

32:21.524 --> 32:23.693
<i>"I'm Jim Gordon.</i>

32:24.652 --> 32:28.197
"I'll find a way to win."

32:30.033 --> 32:31.367
"Or die."

32:35.538 --> 32:37.457
It's option B, baby.

32:39.417 --> 32:41.544
Your fondest wish come true.

32:43.880 --> 32:45.298
I don't want to die.

32:46.257 --> 32:47.258
Oh...

32:48.051 --> 32:49.218
Hey.

32:50.887 --> 32:52.388
Sure you do.

32:53.681 --> 32:57.852
Aren't you tired of hiding your true self?

33:00.021 --> 33:02.315
Tired of lying to yourself?

33:03.775 --> 33:05.068
To Lee?

33:05.902 --> 33:07.737
I don't lie to Lee.

33:09.280 --> 33:10.573
Really?

33:12.283 --> 33:13.534
Let's ask her.

33:19.123 --> 33:20.291
Lee!

33:33.221 --> 33:34.430
Savor every moment.

33:40.770 --> 33:42.146
Hey, girlfriend.

33:43.940 --> 33:47.068
We really need to talk about this bad boy.

33:52.115 --> 33:53.741
<i>We had real love.</i>

33:55.034 --> 33:57.161
<i>You asked me to marry you.</i>

33:57.328 --> 34:00.832
<i>I booked a church.
I bought a damn wedding dress.</i>

34:01.374 --> 34:03.710
<i>Jim, fool that I am,</i>

34:04.794 --> 34:06.879
<i>I still love you, even now.</i>

34:11.801 --> 34:14.804
<i>I booked a church.
I bought a damn wedding dress.</i>

34:20.309 --> 34:22.395
I want updates every 15 minutes.

34:22.562 --> 34:24.772
Hang on. Turn around
and get the hell out of here!

34:24.939 --> 34:26.149
She's taking him to church.

34:26.315 --> 34:27.483
Church? What church?

34:27.650 --> 34:29.193
She talked about the wedding
they never had.

34:29.360 --> 34:30.486
She wants a do-over.

34:30.653 --> 34:34.323
Gotham Cathedral is nearest
to the snatch site. That's where they are.

34:34.490 --> 34:37.326
- That's thin.
- I know I am right.

34:39.829 --> 34:41.247
I'll call you back.

34:41.414 --> 34:42.915
Let's go.

34:48.838 --> 34:51.799
So, Lee, how do you think
your relationship with Jim is going?

34:51.966 --> 34:54.886
This doesn't concern Lee. Let her go.
This is between you and me.

34:55.052 --> 34:56.053
Oh...

34:57.180 --> 35:00.308
This is about all of us.

35:01.017 --> 35:04.687
She deserves to know exactly who you are.

35:07.315 --> 35:08.733
I know who he is.

35:08.900 --> 35:11.903
Oh, how could you,
when he doesn't even know?

35:12.945 --> 35:17.200
He is incapable
of being honest with himself.

35:18.242 --> 35:19.660
Let alone anyone else.

35:19.827 --> 35:21.287
What about you?

35:21.704 --> 35:23.164
This entire day has been a lie.

35:23.331 --> 35:25.833
You were never gonna
give up proof on Galavan.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.210
Who?

35:27.585 --> 35:28.586
Oh!

35:28.920 --> 35:30.588
You want some honesty?

35:31.339 --> 35:32.548
Fine.

35:34.884 --> 35:36.344
Mayor James

35:36.511 --> 35:38.054
is alive and well

35:38.721 --> 35:41.307
at a stash house on China Docks.

35:42.058 --> 35:44.227
Hmm. See?

35:44.393 --> 35:45.645
Honesty.

35:46.103 --> 35:48.356
- Now, you.
- Who put him there?

35:49.315 --> 35:50.608
Who put him there?

35:50.775 --> 35:52.860
Boring, Jim!

35:54.403 --> 35:57.281
The Jim Gordon you know is an act.

35:58.032 --> 36:02.537
He's like an addict who thinks
he can dabble in darkness

36:02.703 --> 36:05.248
as long as nobody sees the needle marks.

36:05.414 --> 36:07.333
Everyone has an act.

36:09.210 --> 36:12.630
Did he tell you
how he got reinstated at the G.C.P.D.?

36:13.089 --> 36:14.423
He killed a man for Penguin.

36:16.217 --> 36:19.595
Wow! Very good, Jim.

36:19.804 --> 36:21.264
You did tell her.

36:21.556 --> 36:23.474
- We don't have secrets between us.
- Mmm-hmm.

36:23.641 --> 36:27.103
He's done a lot of things
that he's not proud of. Everyone has.

36:27.937 --> 36:30.690
But you love him anyway? Is that right?

36:31.524 --> 36:33.943
Despite all his faults.

36:34.110 --> 36:35.486
Yes, I do.

36:38.281 --> 36:41.450
Cute little do-gooder Dr. Lee. Hmm?

36:42.326 --> 36:45.788
In love with a cruel, cold,
death-obsessed sadist.

36:45.955 --> 36:47.498
That's not Jim.

36:51.043 --> 36:54.130
Do you think you know him
better than I do? Hmm?

36:55.214 --> 36:56.924
<i>I love him, too, you know.</i>

36:57.842 --> 37:01.178
I know him better than you do.

37:01.470 --> 37:03.306
Okay, Barbara, I hear you.

37:03.472 --> 37:05.474
You love him, we both love him.
That's okay--

37:05.641 --> 37:08.227
But I love him more!

37:08.394 --> 37:10.730
Okay, listen, Barbara.
I know that now. Please...

37:11.981 --> 37:14.066
I'm gonna prove that I love him more.

37:15.067 --> 37:19.697
I am going to carve
your pretty face off your skull.

37:20.531 --> 37:24.911
And then you will both understand
what true love is.

37:25.077 --> 37:26.662
Okay, there's just one more thing!

37:26.829 --> 37:28.664
- What?
- Your dress!

37:28.831 --> 37:30.082
I love your dress.

37:30.249 --> 37:31.792
I just want to know where you got it.

37:32.501 --> 37:34.295
Hmm. Oh, um...

37:37.089 --> 37:38.215
Drop the knife!

37:39.008 --> 37:43.095
There he is. My little monster.

37:43.262 --> 37:44.513
Don't make me kill you.

37:44.680 --> 37:46.057
Make you?

37:46.223 --> 37:50.728
Jim, you long to kill me.

37:52.688 --> 37:53.856
Do it, Jim.

37:56.275 --> 37:57.443
Do me.

37:58.069 --> 37:59.654
Don't take another step!

38:07.036 --> 38:08.079
<i>Kill him!</i>

38:20.466 --> 38:21.592
Go get her!

38:25.096 --> 38:26.389
<i>Don't move!</i>

38:29.809 --> 38:31.310
Jim!

38:46.450 --> 38:47.451
It's over.

38:50.079 --> 38:51.330
Not yet.

39:00.715 --> 39:03.092
Hold on. Hold on.

39:04.593 --> 39:05.803
Sorry, baby.

39:06.429 --> 39:08.305
I've been kind of a bad date, huh?

39:12.643 --> 39:14.186
I love you, baby.

39:18.649 --> 39:20.026
No!

39:28.826 --> 39:30.619
Some hedges and bushes broke her fall.

39:30.786 --> 39:33.456
She's got half a dozen broken bones
and a concussion.

39:33.998 --> 39:35.207
She's critical.

39:38.836 --> 39:40.087
Are you okay?

39:40.921 --> 39:42.006
Yeah.

39:45.634 --> 39:47.928
Not now, but when this is over,
we need to talk.

39:48.596 --> 39:49.805
I know.

39:53.100 --> 39:54.810
Tell me you got something from her.

39:55.269 --> 39:58.481
She didn't give up Galavan,
but she did say Mayor James is alive,

39:58.647 --> 40:00.900
stashed in a safe house on China Docks.

40:01.067 --> 40:04.195
All mobile units, China Docks, right now!

40:04.361 --> 40:05.863
<i>10-4, Captain.</i>

40:20.836 --> 40:22.129
G.C.P.D.!

40:40.439 --> 40:41.440
<i>Help.</i>

40:42.233 --> 40:44.151
What is wrong with these people?

40:44.819 --> 40:46.028
Help me!

40:47.696 --> 40:48.697
Mayor James?

40:48.864 --> 40:50.324
Help me, please!

40:51.951 --> 40:53.494
Oh, thank God!

40:54.411 --> 40:56.705
- Who did this to you?
- Who do you think?

40:59.041 --> 41:01.210
All the papers seem to be in order.

41:03.504 --> 41:05.339
You're making the right decision.

41:06.132 --> 41:08.134
Sign, and the file is yours.

41:29.905 --> 41:31.323
I changed my mind.

41:32.867 --> 41:34.660
I can't sell you my company.

41:36.453 --> 41:38.122
<i>Not for any price.</i>

41:38.372 --> 41:41.292
Alfred, get Bruce away from him, now!

41:41.667 --> 41:43.419
- Detective Gordon?
<i>- You're under arrest!</i>

41:47.173 --> 41:48.299
Surprised to see me?

41:49.967 --> 41:51.468
May I ask what the charge is?

41:52.469 --> 41:54.096
The kidnapping
and torture of Aubrey James.

41:54.305 --> 41:55.306
Cuff him.

42:00.936 --> 42:02.271
<i>Get him out of here.</i>

42:05.274 --> 42:06.317
Where...

42:08.611 --> 42:10.571
No! No!

42:12.072 --> 42:13.782
Tell me who killed them!

42:15.117 --> 42:17.953
<i>Please! I'll do anything.</i>

42:31.967 --> 42:33.177
<i>Finally.</i>

42:54.657 --> 42:55.658
Oh!

43:12.675 --> 43:13.759
Oh, my.

43:14.969 --> 43:16.345
Mr. Penguin?

43:17.930 --> 43:20.349
Help me. Please.

44:05.352 --> 44:06.395
