Latin lover narrator:
<i>Welcome back. Let's review</i>
<i>what happened last.</i>

00:03.738 --> 00:05.537
<i>When jane was young,</i>
<i>her grandmother taught her</i>

00:05.539 --> 00:06.672
<i>To protect her flower.</i>

00:10.744 --> 00:13.045
<i>And so jane waited...</i>

00:13.047 --> 00:14.446
<i>Which wasn't always easy.</i>

00:14.448 --> 00:15.481
<i>This is jane's fiancÃ©.</i>

00:15.483 --> 00:17.016
<i>He's a detective.</i>

00:17.018 --> 00:19.785
<i>Their life was</i>
<i>perfectly on track, until...</i>

00:19.787 --> 00:21.787
Oh, there you are,
dr. Alver.

00:21.789 --> 00:23.756
You have an insemination
in seven and a path in eight.

00:23.758 --> 00:26.125
Alver: Yeah, an insemination
and a path, yeah, I got it.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.459
Should I...
No, I-I got it.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.762
<i>She does</i> not <i>"got it."</i>

00:29.764 --> 00:32.798
Are you ready
for your insemination?
(snores) hi. Yes.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.100
I artificially inseminated
the wrong woman.

00:35.102 --> 00:37.803
<i>And the father,</i>
<i>dr. Alver's brother, rafael,</i>

00:37.805 --> 00:40.072
<i>Who jane kissed once</i>
<i>five years ago,</i>

00:40.074 --> 00:41.373
Only now he's married to petra.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.242
<i>Got all that?</i>
<i>There's more.</i>

00:43.244 --> 00:45.244
<i>Jane did not know that her</i>
<i>favorite telenovela star</i>

00:45.246 --> 00:47.379
<i>Was actually her father,</i>
<i>who her mother</i>

00:47.381 --> 00:49.648
<i>Recently got</i>
<i>back in touch with.</i>

00:49.650 --> 00:51.817
<i>And now you are caught up.</i>

00:51.819 --> 00:53.819
â™ª

00:53.821 --> 00:56.588
<i>Jane's quinceaÃ±era was,</i>
<i>without a doubt,</i>

00:56.590 --> 00:59.158
<i>The worst party</i>
<i>she'd ever been to.</i>

00:59.160 --> 01:01.326
<i>But not for lack of effort.</i>

01:01.328 --> 01:04.730
<i>In fact, jane had planned</i>
<i>the day down to a tee.</i>

01:04.732 --> 01:07.800
<i>The flowers.</i>

01:07.802 --> 01:10.069
<i>The entrance.</i>

01:12.072 --> 01:14.440
<i>The perfectly</i>
<i>choreographed dance</i>

01:14.442 --> 01:18.310
<i>With the superfly date.</i>

01:18.312 --> 01:20.079
<i>What she didn't plan?</i>
<i>That her mother</i>

01:20.081 --> 01:21.814
<i>Would take over the mike</i>
<i>and perform</i>

01:21.816 --> 01:24.149
<i>The number one hit</i>
<i>currently sweeping the nation.</i>

01:24.151 --> 01:26.285
â™ª my milkshake brings
all the boys to the yard â™ª

01:26.287 --> 01:29.254
â™ª and they're like,
it's better than yours â™ª

01:29.256 --> 01:30.355
â™ª it's better than yours...

01:30.357 --> 01:32.124
<i>But to her credit,</i>

01:32.126 --> 01:33.492
<i>Jane did not panic.</i>

01:33.494 --> 01:35.327
<i>She simply moved on.</i>

01:35.329 --> 01:37.096
Who wants cake?

01:38.164 --> 01:39.465
No, thank you, <i>abuela.</i>

01:39.467 --> 01:41.266
I'm not hungry.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.537
<i>And jane was determined</i>
<i>to move on now.</i>

01:45.539 --> 01:47.339
Yes, I know,
but that is not gonna be

01:47.341 --> 01:48.841
The focus of everything
moving forward.

01:48.843 --> 01:51.143
I'm gonna... I'm gonna
get back to my life.

01:51.145 --> 01:52.711
In fact,

01:52.713 --> 01:54.279
That's the reason why I
called this family meeting.

01:54.281 --> 01:56.381
Michael, welcome
to your first family meeting.

01:56.383 --> 01:58.550
Happy to be here.
Proud to be representing

01:58.552 --> 02:00.119
The male point of view.

02:00.121 --> 02:02.187
Ooh. Oh, see,
I wouldn't lead

02:02.189 --> 02:04.223
With that, 'cause that's not
gonna do well in our meetings.

02:04.225 --> 02:06.792
I'm mostly here
to watch and observe.

02:06.794 --> 02:09.561
So, I just wanted
to go over the plan.

02:09.563 --> 02:11.163
All right?
The most important thing

02:11.165 --> 02:13.232
Is that this... Event...

02:13.234 --> 02:14.867
Doesn't derail my life.

02:14.869 --> 02:16.802
Nothing else has changed.
All right?

02:16.804 --> 02:18.737
I'm almost at the finish line
with college.

02:18.739 --> 02:21.473
I got a good job.
I'm engaged to a great guy.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.242
Sure, there are

02:23.244 --> 02:25.244
A few logistical things
I'm gonna have to do

02:25.246 --> 02:27.246
To make sure it...
Stays in good health,

02:27.248 --> 02:29.248
Like I set up a sonogram,
for instance.

02:29.250 --> 02:32.451
But other than that,
nothing has changed.

02:32.453 --> 02:34.253
Got it?

02:36.823 --> 02:38.657
Yes. Go ahead.

02:40.493 --> 02:41.527
<i>Abuela!</i>

02:44.297 --> 02:45.631
She said that I should
keep the baby.

02:45.633 --> 02:48.600
Oh! No, she's not
keeping the baby.

02:48.602 --> 02:49.835
Stop, <i>abuela.</i>

02:49.837 --> 02:51.203
I'm not gonna
keep the baby.

02:51.205 --> 02:52.471
I-in fact,

02:52.473 --> 02:54.339
We're not gonna refer
to it as a baby.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.675
We're gonna... We're gonna
call it something else.

02:56.677 --> 03:00.479
W... We are going
to call it, um...

03:00.481 --> 03:02.848
â™ª my milkshake brings
all the boys to the yard... â™ª

03:02.850 --> 03:04.416
...A milkshake.

03:04.418 --> 03:06.919
And I can't wait to
give that milkshake

03:06.921 --> 03:08.754
To its rightful owners--

03:08.756 --> 03:11.223
Good people who
really want it.

03:11.225 --> 03:13.258
I want a divorce.

03:18.331 --> 03:20.199
Well, I don't.

03:20.201 --> 03:23.202
And jane's not gonna give
you that child on your own.

03:23.204 --> 03:24.503
(scoffs): Yeah.

03:24.505 --> 03:25.837
I know.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.239
Just like I know

03:27.241 --> 03:28.907
That you're trying
to wait out our prenup

03:28.909 --> 03:30.409
To make money off me.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.911
So, tell me, sweetheart...

03:32.913 --> 03:34.947
How are we gonna
work through that?

03:34.949 --> 03:37.216
(knocking on door)

03:49.596 --> 03:52.331
Hey, man, how
you holding up?

03:52.333 --> 03:54.233
Good.
Yeah?

03:54.235 --> 03:56.335
We're good.

04:00.273 --> 04:02.341
Catalina creel?
Seriously, <i>abuela?</i>

04:02.343 --> 04:04.443
Who is catalina creel?
This super psycho
telenovela villain

04:04.445 --> 04:07.512
Who wore an eye patch
everywhere even though
she wasn't really blind.

04:07.514 --> 04:09.514
(ringtone playing)
petra's not a super psycho.

04:11.517 --> 04:13.352
Jane: Okay,
you know what?

04:13.354 --> 04:16.622
I... Am gonna meet with petra.

04:16.624 --> 04:17.823
She's just texted me.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.491
She'd like to meet.

04:19.493 --> 04:21.326
Sounds lovely.

04:22.962 --> 04:25.731
Great. She is excited
to set something up.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.332
Are you happy?

04:27.334 --> 04:28.800
And once I meet
with her, I am going

04:28.802 --> 04:31.036
To think about this pregnancy
as little as possible.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.804
I'm gonna get back to my life.

04:32.806 --> 04:34.339
Uh-uh. No way.

04:34.341 --> 04:36.375
After that, you sue
the frickin' doctor.

04:36.377 --> 04:37.676
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ah, yes,</i>

04:37.678 --> 04:40.345
<i>The frickin' doctor.</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

04:41.981 --> 04:45.050
<i>The frickin' doctor was trying</i>
<i>to move forward as well.</i>

04:47.854 --> 04:51.757
Mrs. Diana t. Gower.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

04:51.759 --> 04:54.026
Can you just say your name
one more time,

04:54.028 --> 04:55.027
And this time
would you mind

04:55.029 --> 04:56.828
Also spelling it slowly?

04:56.830 --> 05:00.065
Twice-- you can never
be too careful.

05:02.335 --> 05:04.636
The nurse said
you were between patients.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.473
Well...

05:08.475 --> 05:10.342
I'm sure the mistake
will be dealt with

05:10.344 --> 05:11.410
Through
the appropriate channels,

05:11.412 --> 05:13.045
And since I haven't
received the...

05:13.047 --> 05:14.680
Official notification
that my license is suspended,

05:14.682 --> 05:15.981
I figured I should
just keep practicing.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.582
(computer chimes)

05:17.584 --> 05:19.651
Oh, okay, there's
the official notification.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.321
My license is suspended.

05:22.323 --> 05:24.089
Luisa, you're not
drinking are you?

05:24.091 --> 05:25.490
No.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.859
No, I'm not.
What I'm doing is

05:27.861 --> 05:30.329
That I'm trying to be practical,
which is why I called you.

05:30.331 --> 05:31.596
I mean, you were
a pretty good lawyer

05:31.598 --> 05:33.098
Before you gave it up
to become a trophy wife.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.499
Take care of yourself.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.101
No, stop it. I'm sorry.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.102
I don't know
why I said that.

05:37.104 --> 05:38.103
I'm going through a lot,

05:38.105 --> 05:40.339
And I'm lashing out. I...

05:40.341 --> 05:41.873
I need your help.

05:43.509 --> 05:45.344
I called my insurance company,
and there's

05:45.346 --> 05:47.079
This thing in my policy.

05:47.081 --> 05:49.815
It mentions my brother,
and I'm not sure I understand it

05:49.817 --> 05:50.849
Because of all
the legal jargon.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.652
Zaz:
<i>You put your shares</i>

05:53.654 --> 05:55.354
Of the hotel up as collateral?

05:55.356 --> 05:56.855
In case of a lawsuit, yeah.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.858
Look, no one would insure luisa
with her history of addiction.

06:00.626 --> 06:03.462
She's my sister.

06:03.464 --> 06:06.131
And I believed her
when she said she'd changed.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.532
So if jane sues me...?

06:07.534 --> 06:10.736
Your brother's hotel
could be on the line.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.471
I just don't want
to spend the next year

06:12.473 --> 06:13.705
In a whole legal battle.
I just want

06:13.707 --> 06:15.640
To keep moving forward
with my life.

06:15.642 --> 06:18.110
(ringtone plays)
finish college, obsess
about wedding dresses--

06:18.112 --> 06:19.811
And who keeps
calling you, mom?

06:19.813 --> 06:22.814
Can you ask rafael if I can sing
at the hotel next month?

06:22.816 --> 06:23.882
I heard paulina rubio's

06:23.884 --> 06:25.951
Producer might be in town, so...

06:25.953 --> 06:27.719
Is it bruce?

06:27.721 --> 06:29.621
(ringtone continues)

06:29.623 --> 06:32.090
Yeah, it's bruce.
Mom!

06:32.092 --> 06:33.458
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It is important to note</i>

06:33.460 --> 06:34.760
<i>That bruce is xiomara's</i>

06:34.762 --> 06:35.894
<i>Married ex-boyfriend.</i>

06:35.896 --> 06:37.496
Stop calling!

06:37.498 --> 06:39.598
<i>It is also important</i>
<i>to note that that was</i>

06:39.600 --> 06:42.134
<i>Not bruce calling.</i>
<i>In fact,</i>

06:42.136 --> 06:44.636
<i>It was jane's father,</i>
<i>who xo saw out of the blue</i>

06:44.638 --> 06:46.171
<i>16 months ago.</i>

06:49.409 --> 06:51.410
<i>Seeing her</i>
<i>high school boyfriend</i>

06:51.412 --> 06:54.746
<i>On a telenovela was shocking.</i>

06:54.748 --> 06:57.115
<i>So xiomara did</i>
<i>the only sensible thing.</i>

06:57.117 --> 06:59.851
<i>She rushed home to google him.</i>

06:59.853 --> 07:02.487
Jane:
Hey.

07:02.489 --> 07:03.889
Who's the hottie?

07:08.828 --> 07:10.495
â™ª

07:10.497 --> 07:14.433
<i>But alas,</i>
<i>jane didn't know any of that.</i>

07:14.435 --> 07:16.134
<i>Yet.</i>

07:22.608 --> 07:25.577
<i>And so for a brief moment,</i>

07:25.579 --> 07:27.679
<i>As jane went to work</i>
<i>that morning,</i>

07:27.681 --> 07:30.048
<i>It truly felt</i>
<i>like nothing had changed.</i>

07:30.050 --> 07:31.216
Jane.

07:31.218 --> 07:33.452
Hi. I'm sorry to
ambush you like this.

07:33.454 --> 07:36.054
I just wanted to talk
really quickly about the...

07:36.056 --> 07:37.856
(quietly):
Uh... The baby.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.791
<i>Like I said,</i>
<i>the moment was brief.</i>

07:39.793 --> 07:42.227
Oh. Yes. Hi.
Hey.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.929
I actually texted your wife.
Yes, I heard.

07:43.931 --> 07:45.630
Yeah, I was just trying
to put a name to the face

07:45.632 --> 07:47.098
And make sure
she didn't have an eye patch.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.200
What?

07:48.202 --> 07:49.935
Nothing. That was
a bad joke. Sorry.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.570
I am really excited
to meet her.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.905
And, you know,
see the whole picture

07:53.907 --> 07:56.708
And the two-parent-home thing.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.243
Right.

07:58.245 --> 08:00.612
So, that's pretty
important to you, huh?

08:00.614 --> 08:03.949
Yeah, it's the reason why
I feel good about my decision.

08:03.951 --> 08:06.518
Sorry, what was it
that you wanted to talk

08:06.520 --> 08:07.486
To me about?

08:07.488 --> 08:09.521
<i>In truth, he decided</i>

08:09.523 --> 08:12.557
<i>To come clean to jane and</i>
<i>tell her his marriage is over.</i>

08:12.559 --> 08:14.726
Just some... Lawsuit
stuff, actually.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.528
<i>But alas, plans change.</i>

08:16.530 --> 08:17.729
You're suing?

08:17.731 --> 08:19.564
(laughs):
No. I'm not suing.

08:19.566 --> 08:22.901
Just... Luisa, dr. Alver,
is my sister, so it's...

08:22.903 --> 08:26.004
What?
The... Doctor who
inseminated you.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.606
She's your sister?

08:27.608 --> 08:29.508
She's... Your sister?

08:29.510 --> 08:31.209
Yes. But I mean, we're not
on good terms, obviously.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.945
No, but she's, like,
really your sister?

08:36.516 --> 08:37.582
(stammering quietly)

08:37.584 --> 08:40.585
I just... Wow.

08:40.587 --> 08:43.255
And not to make things
more awkward...

08:43.257 --> 08:46.224
But, jane, you should
really talk to a lawyer.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.593
Come up with an amount,
present it to us,

08:48.595 --> 08:50.729
And that way I can
pay you directly,

08:50.731 --> 08:52.898
And that way you'll
make the most money.

08:52.900 --> 08:55.567
What makes you think
that I want money?

08:55.569 --> 08:57.168
I don't know, I just
assumed, because...

08:57.170 --> 08:58.870
Because I'm a waitress?

08:58.872 --> 09:01.573
No. I... I know you're
not just a waitress.

09:01.575 --> 09:02.974
"just a waitress."
that's not
what I meant.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.609
Look, you're in college...
So if I wasn't

09:04.611 --> 09:06.545
In college, I would be
"just a waitress."

09:06.547 --> 09:08.113
Jane, I think you're
taking this the wrong way.

09:08.115 --> 09:10.549
Yeah. Maybe I am.

09:10.551 --> 09:11.983
Except this huge thing
just happened,

09:11.985 --> 09:14.185
And you're telling me
that your sister did it,

09:14.187 --> 09:15.887
And then you're
offering me money.

09:17.189 --> 09:19.824
I got to change.

09:20.993 --> 09:21.927
Seriously, what did you expect?

09:21.929 --> 09:24.029
He's a rich playboy.

09:24.031 --> 09:26.565
Rich playboy
with an entitled attitude,

09:26.567 --> 09:28.667
Missing a basic
sensitivity chip.

09:28.669 --> 09:31.136
He was so much nicer
in my head.

09:31.138 --> 09:32.704
That's because
he's a good kisser.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.005
What?!
You kissed him?

09:34.007 --> 09:35.307
You slut!
When?

09:35.309 --> 09:36.708
It was five years ago.
Not a big deal.

09:36.710 --> 09:37.776
What did magic mikey
say when you

09:37.778 --> 09:38.777
Told him?
Did he freak out?

09:38.779 --> 09:40.211
No.

09:40.213 --> 09:42.347
Because I haven't
actually told michael yet.

09:42.349 --> 09:44.583
He just found out the news
about my pregnancy,

09:44.585 --> 09:47.852
And I want it to settle-- I just
don't want it to be weird.

09:47.854 --> 09:49.120
Or <i>weirder.</i>

09:49.122 --> 09:50.355
It's definitely weirder.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.857
I'm trying to find
the right moment.

09:52.859 --> 09:53.825
Before he meets rafael.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.126
Obviously. Whatever.

09:55.128 --> 09:57.028
I'm sure rafael
is a fine guy.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.965
We just had one bad interaction;
I'm just gonna let it go.

10:02.068 --> 10:04.603
What?
Nothing.

10:04.605 --> 10:06.338
Just heard some things
about him over the years.

10:06.340 --> 10:08.974
What kind of things?

10:08.976 --> 10:12.043
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Very bad things.</i>

10:12.045 --> 10:14.179
<i>Very,</i> very <i>bad things.</i>

10:14.181 --> 10:17.082
Oh, my god.

10:17.084 --> 10:19.718
<i>It is important to know</i>
<i>that, right now,</i>

10:19.720 --> 10:21.720
<i>Jane is panicking.</i>

10:21.722 --> 10:22.754
We're gonna have to keep it.
I don't want to,

10:22.756 --> 10:23.755
And you don't want to,

10:23.757 --> 10:25.190
But we're gonna have to.

10:25.192 --> 10:26.758
W-wait-wait,
what's going on, jane?

10:26.760 --> 10:28.393
I can't give rafael
the milkshake.

10:34.834 --> 10:37.202
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It is important to note</i>
<i>that michael cordero jr.</i>

10:37.204 --> 10:38.970
<i>Is not a virgin.</i>

10:38.972 --> 10:40.905
<i>Well, it's important to him.</i>

10:40.907 --> 10:42.707
<i>I don't really care</i>
<i>about it too much.</i>

10:42.709 --> 10:44.676
<i>But what is important to know</i>

10:44.678 --> 10:47.078
<i>Is that michael never planned</i>
<i>to date a virgin.</i>

10:47.080 --> 10:49.981
<i>But when he met jane,</i>
<i>everything changed.</i>

10:49.983 --> 10:51.182
Oh. Oh.

10:51.184 --> 10:54.352
Okay, okay.
I thought about it.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.187
This doesn't mean
that we have to keep it, right?

10:56.189 --> 10:58.323
There has got to be some
legal loophole that we can find.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.025
We'll declare him unfit,
we'll find other good parents.

11:00.027 --> 11:02.227
Okay, calm down,
slow down.
Did you see what I sent you?

11:02.229 --> 11:04.829
Did you click on the links?
Yeah. I wish you
would've warned me

11:04.831 --> 11:05.730
Before the bora bora series.

11:05.732 --> 11:06.998
Michael, don't you think

11:07.000 --> 11:08.333
That I have a moral obligation
to make sure

11:08.335 --> 11:09.701
That the milkshake goes
to a decent person?

11:09.703 --> 11:11.302
And that is not a decent person.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.271
What he did in bora bora
is not decent.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.440
It literally is indecent,
which is why he got arrested.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.075
And it was also a while ago.
(sighs)

11:17.077 --> 11:19.110
You said the guy
had cancer, right?

11:19.112 --> 11:23.081
He obviously went through some
major life-changing event.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.684
You know, he's marr..
He's happily married now.

11:25.686 --> 11:28.086
Trust me, bora bora
guy doesn't want a baby.

11:28.088 --> 11:31.222
Yeah, I mean,
that's definitely true.

11:31.224 --> 11:33.091
Look, I get why you're anxious,

11:33.093 --> 11:35.226
But, uh, you-you're gonna
meet the wife, right?

11:35.228 --> 11:38.196
Mm-hmm.
I bet you'll feel
better when you do.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.365
Give this guy a real chance.

11:40.367 --> 11:43.468
Huh.

11:43.470 --> 11:46.271
So, I just stood there,
talking to her about money

11:46.273 --> 11:48.907
And lying about my marriage.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.875
Well, petra's
trying at least.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.210
Driving my staff crazy,

11:52.212 --> 11:55.013
Wanting everything to be perfect
for the party tonight.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.347
She's trying
to impress my father.

11:56.349 --> 11:58.149
Yeah, so you
look good.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.885
It's his first time
seeing the renovations.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.487
He's got to
be blown away

12:02.489 --> 12:05.023
If he's gonna trust
you to run things here.

12:05.025 --> 12:07.092
Petra knows how
important this is to you.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.293
Yeah, maybe,
or maybe she knows

12:08.295 --> 12:10.228
That if she gets my father
on her side,

12:10.230 --> 12:12.497
It will be that much harder
for me to leave her.

12:12.499 --> 12:15.100
Wow.

12:15.102 --> 12:16.968
So, you're pretty
much done then, huh?

12:16.970 --> 12:19.104
Yeah. I am.

12:22.341 --> 12:25.343
Why did she order
an ice sculpture of a wizard?

12:26.312 --> 12:29.280
I said marlin, not merlin!

12:29.282 --> 12:32.450
A marlin? Like the fish?

12:32.452 --> 12:34.119
Yes, like the fish!

12:34.121 --> 12:38.123
(sighs) my father-in-law
loves to fish.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.959
Does he also like magic?

12:40.961 --> 12:43.394
(growling)

12:54.974 --> 12:56.074
(growling)

12:56.076 --> 12:57.876
We got a leopard on the loose!

12:57.878 --> 13:01.112
(people screaming,
bell ringing)

13:04.383 --> 13:06.351
(screaming continues)

13:12.224 --> 13:15.226
We need to
talk right now.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.428
(leopard growling)

13:17.430 --> 13:19.898
(excited chatter in background)

13:19.900 --> 13:21.232
You can't keep calling me!
I said I'd tell her

13:21.234 --> 13:22.967
When the time is right,
and I'll tell her!

13:22.969 --> 13:25.570
When? I want to be a part
of my daughter's life.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.238
You kept her from me
long enough.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.907
Yeah, well, you
shouldn't have told me

13:28.909 --> 13:30.909
To have an abortion.
Shh. I was just a kid.

13:30.911 --> 13:33.344
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know,
and I was just a kid

13:33.346 --> 13:35.947
When I told my mom you
were some random army guy,

13:35.949 --> 13:37.315
And now it's been
so long, and I...

13:37.317 --> 13:38.483
(sighs heavily)

13:38.485 --> 13:40.385
Uh, I know it's hard, xiomara.

13:40.387 --> 13:43.321
And I was a screw-up years ago,
but I have changed.

13:43.323 --> 13:46.825
I want my daughter to have
the pleasure of knowing me.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.993
I want to be a part
of her life.

13:52.832 --> 13:57.135
Yeah... Okay, I'll
tell her... Today.

13:57.137 --> 14:00.305
Good. What is she like?

14:00.307 --> 14:02.841
Jane? Oh.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.876
She's awesome.

14:04.878 --> 14:07.345
Smart, strong, determined.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.547
Pregnant.

14:09.549 --> 14:12.183
I am to be a grandfather?

14:12.185 --> 14:13.551
Kind of.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.386
It was a medical mistake.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.521
Long story.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.356
Who's the father?

14:18.358 --> 14:22.393
But I honestly hoped this baby
would be a real chance for us.

14:22.395 --> 14:25.263
Because you might have stopped
loving me,

14:25.265 --> 14:27.532
But I never stop loving you.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.467
Okay... Better, but I think

14:29.469 --> 14:31.402
You'd be more effective
if you'd make yourself cry.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.137
Just, like, one tear.

14:33.139 --> 14:35.440
I haven't cried since
I was a child, zaz.

14:35.442 --> 14:38.142
God, I hate that I have to
humiliate myself like this.

14:38.144 --> 14:40.378
I know, but this
baby angle isn't gonna last.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.513
You're gonna have
to make him love you again.

14:42.515 --> 14:44.983
What if I can't?
Oh, please.

14:44.985 --> 14:47.452
With your... Arsenal...

14:47.454 --> 14:50.088
Of weapons, hmm? Hmm?

14:50.090 --> 14:51.589
Come on!

14:51.591 --> 14:53.958
You only have to last
one more year.

14:53.960 --> 14:57.161
Then, you'll cash out
of your prenup,

14:57.163 --> 14:58.997
And we can get
the hell out of here.

15:03.435 --> 15:05.236
Michael:
Girl's in there again.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.171
Don't need to watch this part.

15:07.173 --> 15:09.474
What a waste of time.
Nothing's happening.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.509
We've only been here 48 hours.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.478
Cortes named roman zazo
as a contact.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.680
If he's right,
this is the first real lead

15:15.682 --> 15:17.916
We've had on sin rostro
in four years.

15:17.918 --> 15:22.020
We haven't heard from sin rostro
in four years because he's dead.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.688
You know what
would be great?

15:23.690 --> 15:26.057
If partner wasn't always
working against me.

15:26.059 --> 15:28.359
You don't go from
the biggest drug game in town

15:28.361 --> 15:30.228
To radio silence,
unless you're six feet under.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.630
Or regrouping,
planning something big.

15:32.632 --> 15:35.233
(phone chimes)

15:35.235 --> 15:36.634
Finally... An I.D.
On the woman.

15:36.636 --> 15:39.370
I don't know what
took all damn day.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.105
Petra solano.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.407
Oh, wow.

15:42.409 --> 15:43.574
Apparently, she's the wife

15:43.576 --> 15:45.376
Of the guy who owns the hotel.

15:45.378 --> 15:48.012
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Try to remember, later,</i>

15:48.014 --> 15:50.281
<i>That michael's first thought</i>
<i>in this moment was jane.</i>

15:50.283 --> 15:51.482
<i>He had to tell...</i>

15:51.484 --> 15:53.418
Jane.

15:53.420 --> 15:56.020
Hey. I just wanted to apologize
for what happened earlier.

15:56.022 --> 15:59.390
The truth is, I have no idea
how to act around you.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.459
No, it's fine.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.494
So I should get back
to work. You know,

16:03.496 --> 16:05.730
Trying to get on with my life,
not constantly think about it.

16:05.732 --> 16:07.465
Yeah, that makes sense.
Mm-hmm.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.335
Just one more thing.
What's that?

16:10.337 --> 16:12.670
I would love to come
to any doctor's appointments?

16:15.307 --> 16:17.475
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It should be noted</i>
<i>that at this very moment,</i>

16:17.477 --> 16:20.278
<i>All jane wanted to do</i>
<i>was scream "no!"</i>

16:20.280 --> 16:23.381
<i>But alas, michael said</i>
<i>to give him another try.</i>

16:23.383 --> 16:25.416
I actually have a sonogram
scheduled for this afternoon.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.285
Why don't you
and your wife come?

16:27.287 --> 16:29.320
Really?
I mean, you definitely
don't have to.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.622
Great.
Great.

16:43.502 --> 16:46.771
What are you doing?

16:46.773 --> 16:48.506
Focusing on the bright side.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.508
Drinking will not
solve anything.

16:50.510 --> 16:53.378
I know, but every
time I don't drink,

16:53.380 --> 16:54.645
I feel good about myself,

16:54.647 --> 16:57.448
And I need something
to feel good about,

16:57.450 --> 16:59.250
Because my brother
won't speak to me,

16:59.252 --> 17:02.086
My wife cheated on me,
and I have nowhere to go,

17:02.088 --> 17:05.323
And I'm about to be slapped
with a huge lawsuit.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.624
But I'm not drinking.

17:06.626 --> 17:09.193
At least I'm
not drinking.

17:13.332 --> 17:15.633
You're crazy.
You know that?

17:15.635 --> 17:17.769
Don't call me crazy.

17:17.771 --> 17:20.805
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...

17:23.442 --> 17:26.411
Oh, we can't.

17:26.413 --> 17:28.713
I know.

17:40.626 --> 17:44.395
<i>(moaning)</i>

17:44.397 --> 17:47.432
Oh! Oh! Oh!

17:47.434 --> 17:48.833
Oh, I'm so sorry, baby.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.468
They're running late.
Are you there?

17:50.470 --> 17:52.770
Yup, I am here.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.539
Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.441
Woman:
Amy nesson?

17:56.443 --> 17:59.177
Michael:
Are you

17:59.179 --> 18:00.511
Clo...

18:02.581 --> 18:03.614
Michael?

18:03.616 --> 18:05.483
Woman:
Hi. Come on in.

18:05.485 --> 18:06.851
Hey.
Okay, thanks.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.753
Sorry. Hey, yeah.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.421
Sorry. This place is...
Really weird.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.223
Um, are you close?

18:12.225 --> 18:15.393
Yes. Listen, is, uh, rafael
and petra there yet?

18:15.395 --> 18:17.595
No.
Jane:
Okay, good, good.

18:17.597 --> 18:20.331
'cause I wanted to tell you
something before you met him,

18:20.333 --> 18:22.400
Which wasn't going
to be today, but now it is,

18:22.402 --> 18:24.168
And it's so not a big deal,

18:24.170 --> 18:27.171
But you should know it
before you meet him,

18:27.173 --> 18:29.740
Or it might be a little strange
when you do know.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.442
Know what?

18:31.444 --> 18:35.546
I kissed rafael once,
five years ago.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.248
What?!

18:37.250 --> 18:38.816
Yeah, way before I met you.

18:38.818 --> 18:41.552
Okay, and it was so
not a big deal.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.454
It was nothing really,
you know?

18:43.456 --> 18:45.756
I mean, nothing then;
it means nothing now.

18:45.758 --> 18:48.426
Rafael:
You must be michael.

18:48.428 --> 18:49.660
Hi. I'm rafael.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.596
We'll talk
about this later, jane.

18:53.599 --> 18:56.434
I used to make out
with jane all the time.

18:56.436 --> 18:59.537
What?
I asked if
they're running on time?

18:59.539 --> 19:02.673
Oh, yes, I think so.

19:02.675 --> 19:05.610
Michael cordero,
jane's fiancÃ©.

19:05.612 --> 19:07.578
Oh, I didn't know
you two got engaged.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.480
Yeah, yeah.
It just happened.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.282
We're, like, super happy.

19:11.284 --> 19:13.451
We're really in love, big time.

19:13.453 --> 19:14.852
(laughs)

19:14.854 --> 19:17.655
Just trying to get
through this crazy... Accident.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.490
Yes. Us, too.

19:24.296 --> 19:26.597
Petra solano.
Such a pleasure to meet you.

19:26.599 --> 19:28.399
What your fiancÃ©e
is doing for us--

19:28.401 --> 19:30.468
It's such a gift.
(woman speaking spanish)

19:30.470 --> 19:31.936
Shut it, mom.
We wouldn't be late

19:31.938 --> 19:33.604
If you hadn't made me change
out of my booty shorts.

19:33.606 --> 19:34.739
I didn't know
you two were coming.

19:34.741 --> 19:36.908
Oh. Trust me,
a girl needs her mom.

19:36.910 --> 19:39.310
Are you...?

19:39.312 --> 19:41.445
The father, yes.
Hi. I'm rafael.

19:41.447 --> 19:42.780
I'm jane's mom.

19:42.782 --> 19:44.482
And, yes, I had
her very young.

19:44.484 --> 19:45.683
I'm so sorry. I...

19:45.685 --> 19:48.386
I'm late.

19:48.388 --> 19:51.222
You must be petra.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.691
Yes.

19:56.461 --> 19:57.828
(both laugh)

20:00.866 --> 20:03.234
It is so nice
to finally meet you.

20:03.236 --> 20:04.702
You're making our
dreams come true.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.737
Technician:
Jane villanueva?

20:08.240 --> 20:09.907
Hi.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.642
Hi. Come on in.

20:11.644 --> 20:12.977
(clears throat)
grams.

20:12.979 --> 20:15.546
This is my grandma.
Great. Hi.
Welcome.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.315
Oops. Sorry.
Just gonna get in there.

20:17.317 --> 20:18.783
Technician:
Excuse me.

20:18.785 --> 20:22.520
Oh, sorry. Sorry. Ma, back up.
(overlapping chatter)

20:22.522 --> 20:23.888
You know what?

20:23.890 --> 20:25.923
I'm gonna have
to ask some of you to leave.

20:25.925 --> 20:28.593
Oh, no, no,
I can't leave.
(overlapping chatter)

20:28.595 --> 20:31.562
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Who are the parents?

20:31.564 --> 20:34.632
I'm the father.
Just carrying the baby, so,
I should probably stay.

20:34.634 --> 20:35.666
I'm supposed be the mother,
technically.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.268
My fiancÃ©.
I'm the fiancÃ©.

20:37.270 --> 20:39.537
(overlapping chatter)
okay, you know what?

20:39.539 --> 20:41.372
I'm gonna go on biology.

20:41.374 --> 20:42.673
So you and you.

20:42.675 --> 20:44.609
Everyone else, out.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.612
Thank you.
Good luck, baby.

20:47.614 --> 20:49.614
Okay.
(quiet chatter)

20:49.616 --> 20:50.815
Okay.

20:50.817 --> 20:52.917
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.586
Technician:
All right.

20:56.822 --> 21:00.358
This is gonna be
cold, okay?
(sighs)

21:00.360 --> 21:02.927
You're about seven weeks
along, is that right?

21:02.929 --> 21:04.562
Yes.

21:04.564 --> 21:06.564
Okay, I'm gonna get started.

21:06.566 --> 21:08.699
Will you be wanting pictures?

21:08.701 --> 21:10.768
Yes.
No.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.603
(computer whirring)

21:17.743 --> 21:19.577
So, what are you studying?

21:19.579 --> 21:21.846
Teaching.
Just one more semester.

21:21.848 --> 21:23.547
Nice.

21:23.549 --> 21:24.882
(gasps lightly)

21:24.884 --> 21:26.550
I googled you.
Oh?

21:26.552 --> 21:28.786
Mm.
That couldn't have gone well.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.321
No, it didn't.

21:30.323 --> 21:31.922
Hey, you see...?

21:31.924 --> 21:34.325
Yup, mm-hmm.

21:34.327 --> 21:36.494
(sighs)
oh, god.

21:36.496 --> 21:39.964
I was pretty lost
a year and a half ago.

21:39.966 --> 21:43.634
And when I got sick,
I just went to this really...

21:43.636 --> 21:45.870
Dark place, you know?

21:45.872 --> 21:47.872
So, what changed?

21:47.874 --> 21:49.774
My sister, actually.

21:49.776 --> 21:51.876
She came over one day
and told me

21:51.878 --> 21:53.477
To stop feeling sorry
for myself,

21:53.479 --> 21:54.812
And that I'd find
the bright side.

21:54.814 --> 21:57.348
It's what I needed
to hear, I guess.

21:57.350 --> 21:59.884
So, I started to focus on
the things that I should change,

21:59.886 --> 22:02.687
Which ended up pretty much
being my entire life.

22:02.689 --> 22:05.556
So what made you so lost
to begin with, do you think?

22:05.558 --> 22:08.793
Fear of failure.

22:08.795 --> 22:10.428
That's what it is.

22:10.430 --> 22:12.697
It's fear of failure.

22:12.699 --> 22:15.733
Which can be
a pretty crippling thing.

22:15.735 --> 22:19.603
Yeah, I know.

22:19.605 --> 22:22.006
Is that why you're trying to be
a teacher and not a writer?

22:22.008 --> 22:24.675
(laughs)

22:26.845 --> 22:28.412
Well, it depends.

22:28.414 --> 22:30.348
Am I being
practical or brave?

22:30.350 --> 22:31.916
Practical.

22:31.918 --> 22:33.784
I'm a teacher.

22:33.786 --> 22:36.587
Brave.

22:36.589 --> 22:39.023
I'm a writer?

22:39.025 --> 22:42.460
I have never said that
out loud before.

22:43.695 --> 22:45.663
So what have you been writing?

22:45.665 --> 22:49.033
Not writing anything right now.

22:49.035 --> 22:51.769
What do you <i>want</i> to be writing?

22:52.938 --> 22:54.872
Romance.

22:54.874 --> 22:57.007
Romance?

22:57.009 --> 22:58.008
Mm-hmm.

22:58.010 --> 22:59.643
Really?
(laughs)

23:01.446 --> 23:03.547
Little early
to hear the heartbeat.

23:03.549 --> 23:04.982
(steady heartbeat over monitor)

23:12.758 --> 23:15.826
Latin lover narrator: <i>It was</i>
<i>all a little early indeed.</i>

23:19.865 --> 23:21.665
<i>And now, I implore you</i>
<i>to remember</i>

23:21.667 --> 23:23.134
<i>That michael's first thought</i>

23:23.136 --> 23:24.835
<i>Upon learning</i>
<i>about petra's affair,</i>

23:24.837 --> 23:26.637
<i>Was jane, he had to tell jane.</i>

23:26.639 --> 23:28.038
End the affair.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.941
I don't know what
you're talking about.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.109
Then I'll be clear then.

23:32.111 --> 23:33.778
Stop sleeping with roman zazo.

23:33.780 --> 23:35.579
How...?

23:35.581 --> 23:37.047
Came by the hotel,
saw you together.

23:37.049 --> 23:38.582
Where?
Doesn't matter.

23:38.584 --> 23:39.950
Do you even want this baby?

23:39.952 --> 23:40.985
Yes, of course
I want this baby, I'm...

23:40.987 --> 23:42.086
Then end it.

23:42.088 --> 23:44.455
Or I'll tell your husband.

23:44.457 --> 23:46.590
And, trust me, jane's not
giving that baby to him alone.

23:50.695 --> 23:52.930
And you don't want it.

23:56.168 --> 23:57.935
Fine.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.670
I'll end it.

23:59.672 --> 24:02.940
Who knows? Maybe I'll ask you
for a favor at some point.

24:09.548 --> 24:11.215
Talked to rafael.

24:11.217 --> 24:13.717
Everything's
gonna be fine.

24:13.719 --> 24:15.085
Good.

24:15.087 --> 24:16.620
That's good.

24:16.622 --> 24:19.223
I want you to quit your job.

24:19.225 --> 24:21.559
What?

24:21.561 --> 24:23.227
I-it's, it's too much.

24:23.229 --> 24:24.728
You're carrying
the guy's baby.

24:24.730 --> 24:25.763
You just told me
you kissed him.

24:25.765 --> 24:28.466
Five years ago, it was nothing.

24:28.468 --> 24:29.900
Come on, baby.

24:29.902 --> 24:31.735
I've been there
for four years.

24:31.737 --> 24:34.071
I really like it,
I have all my friends there.

24:34.073 --> 24:36.207
It pays well, I have
health care-- michael...

24:36.209 --> 24:37.975
Babe...
I don't want
to start over.

24:37.977 --> 24:40.110
You know how much
I don't want to start over.

24:40.112 --> 24:42.613
I can't help it--
it makes me uncomfortable.

24:42.615 --> 24:45.649
There are a million other
hotels in south beach.

24:45.651 --> 24:47.718
Just find another one.

24:50.622 --> 24:52.122
<i>(knocking on door)</i>

24:53.091 --> 24:55.092
Janie?

24:55.094 --> 24:57.161
Did you forget your key?

24:58.830 --> 25:00.598
What are you doing here?

25:00.600 --> 25:02.032
Didn't you get my text?

25:02.034 --> 25:03.234
Oh, no, no. I didn't.

25:03.236 --> 25:05.069
I have too many phones.

25:05.071 --> 25:07.771
If it's important, the best way
to reach me is through twitter.

25:07.773 --> 25:09.573
Actually, today isn't
a good day anymore.

25:09.575 --> 25:10.808
Jane seemed off
after her sonogram,

25:10.810 --> 25:12.576
That's what I was
texting you about.

25:12.578 --> 25:13.744
(car approaching)

25:13.746 --> 25:15.079
Oh, shoot! She's coming.

25:15.081 --> 25:16.180
Jane? Now?

25:16.182 --> 25:17.214
How's my hair?

25:17.216 --> 25:18.849
Come on, get in here quick.

25:20.752 --> 25:23.587
What kind of mother are you to
keep a father from his daughter?

25:23.589 --> 25:25.723
She's going through a hard time,
she had her f...

25:25.725 --> 25:26.891
And I have been patient
long enough.

25:26.893 --> 25:28.559
Tell her now, or I will.

25:28.561 --> 25:31.228
Okay, just-- stay here.

25:44.175 --> 25:46.744
Honey...

25:46.746 --> 25:48.646
I wanted to talk with you.

25:48.648 --> 25:52.816
Oh, hang on, I'm gonna just
finish filling something out.

25:58.790 --> 26:00.791
A job application?

26:00.793 --> 26:02.159
You like your job.

26:02.161 --> 26:04.995
Yeah, michael wants me to quit.

26:04.997 --> 26:08.666
He's uncomfortable with rafael.

26:08.668 --> 26:10.634
Which I get.

26:10.636 --> 26:14.004
Plus, the whole sonogram was
kind of hard for him, so...

26:14.006 --> 26:17.074
And how about you?

26:20.011 --> 26:21.111
Oh, honey...

26:21.113 --> 26:23.280
We...

26:23.282 --> 26:25.983
We heard the heartbeat, mom.

26:25.985 --> 26:28.285
And I just started
to think about it.

26:28.287 --> 26:30.654
I just didn't want this
to take over my life

26:30.656 --> 26:32.122
And change everything.

26:32.124 --> 26:33.324
I know, baby. I know.

26:33.326 --> 26:35.326
But it's going to.
Oh...

26:35.328 --> 26:39.296
'cause it's not a stupid
milkshake, it's a baby,

26:39.298 --> 26:40.798
And I'm gonna
get attached to it.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.666
I mean, how can I not?

26:42.668 --> 26:44.335
And then I have
to give it to them.

26:44.337 --> 26:46.303
And that's what I want to do.

26:46.305 --> 26:49.340
I do, but it's gonna be so hard.

26:49.342 --> 26:51.375
I mean, it just is.

26:51.377 --> 26:55.012
Even if rafael
and petra are great.

26:55.014 --> 26:58.716
And I don't know how to prepare,
or how to act,

26:58.718 --> 27:01.018
Or what to do
to not make it hurt.

27:01.020 --> 27:05.356
Honey, I don't think
there's anything you <i>can</i> do.

27:18.970 --> 27:22.106
See this? This right here
is why I keep saying to sue.

27:22.108 --> 27:24.274
Because you're gonna
have a lot of pain.

27:24.276 --> 27:25.843
All because of
this frickin' doctor.

27:25.845 --> 27:27.711
And your life is now hard
and complicated

27:27.713 --> 27:28.846
In ways it shouldn't be.

27:28.848 --> 27:30.881
Mom, don't you cry.

27:30.883 --> 27:32.282
I'm not.

27:32.284 --> 27:34.685
I mean, me? I...

27:34.687 --> 27:36.654
I'm a screw-up.

27:36.656 --> 27:39.790
I mean, I deserved to get
knocked up, but you?

27:39.792 --> 27:41.859
This isn't fair.

27:41.861 --> 27:43.994
Stop, we can't go to that
"it's not fair" place.

27:43.996 --> 27:46.330
We won't go there, then.

27:46.332 --> 27:48.298
Yeah.
We can go

27:48.300 --> 27:49.933
To the "it sucks" place, right?

27:49.935 --> 27:51.802
Yeah, I think that's
where I'm at right now.

27:51.804 --> 27:52.836
It sucks. All around.

27:52.838 --> 27:54.204
Yeah, it does.

27:54.206 --> 27:56.173
But it's gonna suck
worse for you.

27:56.175 --> 27:57.708
And you got to remember that.

27:57.710 --> 27:59.710
That supposed
to make me feel better?

28:02.847 --> 28:06.083
I'm just saying--

28:06.085 --> 28:08.185
You get to be selfish now.

28:08.187 --> 28:10.921
You don't have to take care
of anyone else, just yourself.

28:10.923 --> 28:11.989
Okay?

28:13.958 --> 28:16.160
Yeah. Thanks.

28:18.196 --> 28:20.964
You know, you're
not a screw-up, mom.

28:22.734 --> 28:25.035
I mean, the way you chase
your singing dream.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.937
That's some brave stuff.

28:26.939 --> 28:30.007
I could use some
of that right now.

28:39.150 --> 28:41.218
I guess it...

28:41.220 --> 28:43.821
I guess it's just hitting me
that I'm having a baby.

28:43.823 --> 28:47.157
And how much it
totally sucks.

28:47.159 --> 28:50.227
In a way that doesn't offend god

28:50.229 --> 28:52.730
And whatever higher plan
he has for us.

29:05.777 --> 29:07.311
<i>Bueno.</i>

29:13.952 --> 29:16.787
Where does that expression
come from, anyway?

29:16.789 --> 29:19.389
You know, I really,
I can't even remember.

29:22.193 --> 29:23.861
<i>Abuela...</i>

29:23.863 --> 29:24.995
Mom.

29:24.997 --> 29:26.897
I'm sorry, okay?

29:26.899 --> 29:28.866
Don't be upset about that.

29:28.868 --> 29:31.435
Latin lover narrator: <i>But</i>
<i>xiomara was not upset at all.</i>

29:31.437 --> 29:32.936
<i>Because she remembered</i>
<i>the events</i>

29:32.938 --> 29:36.406
<i>Of the quinceaÃ±era</i>
<i>quite differently.</i>

29:36.408 --> 29:38.876
<i>Here's jane's superfly date.</i>

29:38.878 --> 29:41.979
<i>And here is jane's superfly</i>
<i>date's superslutty hookup.</i>

29:43.982 --> 29:46.884
â™ª my milkshake brings
all the boys to the yard â™ª

29:46.886 --> 29:48.018
â™ª and damn right...

29:48.020 --> 29:49.286
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And the memory</i>

29:49.288 --> 29:51.355
<i>That she was a good mom,</i>

29:51.357 --> 29:53.223
<i>That she knew when to protect</i>
<i>her daughter's feelings,</i>

29:53.225 --> 29:54.958
<i>Fortified xiomara.</i>

29:56.227 --> 29:58.462
I want to see her right now.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.931
No, you won't, because
being a parent means

30:00.933 --> 30:02.299
That you put
your kid's interest first,

30:02.301 --> 30:03.967
And right now,
jane's overwhelmed,

30:03.969 --> 30:05.969
And she needs some part
of her life to not change,

30:05.971 --> 30:08.138
And so you're gonna back off
until I tell you she's ready.

30:08.140 --> 30:12.109
And don't ever question me
as a mother again, got it?

30:12.111 --> 30:13.911
Okay.

30:13.913 --> 30:14.978
I will wait.

30:16.047 --> 30:18.015
But not forever, right?

30:18.983 --> 30:21.318
No.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.387
Not forever.

30:31.029 --> 30:34.097
Her eyes are so
bright and curious.

30:34.099 --> 30:36.934
Much like my own.

30:36.936 --> 30:38.936
Tell me, is she
a singer like you?

30:40.305 --> 30:41.305
What?

30:41.307 --> 30:43.307
Nothing, I-I'm just...

30:43.309 --> 30:44.942
I'm surprised you remembered.

30:44.944 --> 30:47.444
Your voice, xiomara--

30:47.446 --> 30:49.146
Unforgettable.

30:51.082 --> 30:53.083
Yeah, well...

30:53.085 --> 30:55.986
I know I'll have to give up
trying at some point.

30:55.988 --> 30:57.855
Why?

30:57.857 --> 31:00.624
I became an international
star just a few years ago.

31:00.626 --> 31:03.527
Imagine what a disservice it
would have been to the world,

31:03.529 --> 31:05.028
If I had given up.

31:19.611 --> 31:23.046
Michael, it's me.

31:23.048 --> 31:25.983
I thought I could treat this
pregnancy like it was nothing,

31:25.985 --> 31:28.919
Like an inconvenience.

31:28.921 --> 31:31.054
But I can't,
and I can't pretend

31:31.056 --> 31:33.423
<i>That nothing's changed because</i>
<i>everything's changed.</i>

31:33.425 --> 31:35.092
<i>Everything's different now.</i>

31:35.094 --> 31:36.026
I'm gonna be different,

31:36.028 --> 31:37.995
After going through this,

31:37.997 --> 31:39.897
After carrying a baby,

31:39.899 --> 31:43.133
And having to give it up.

31:43.135 --> 31:46.904
So, I need some constants in my
life right now, I really do.

31:46.906 --> 31:50.073
Which is why I'm
gonna keep my job.

31:50.075 --> 31:52.376
And I love you, michael,
and I don't want to hurt you,

31:52.378 --> 31:54.411
But I get to be selfish now.

31:54.413 --> 31:56.947
Not you.

31:56.949 --> 31:59.016
(sighs deeply)

32:02.153 --> 32:03.487
I love you,
and you love me.

32:03.489 --> 32:04.655
It's over, roman.

32:04.657 --> 32:06.323
Let go of me.

32:06.325 --> 32:08.525
(grunts)
what...?

32:09.560 --> 32:11.561
(grunts)

32:17.168 --> 32:19.369
(panting)

32:20.538 --> 32:22.539
Good.

32:22.541 --> 32:24.942
You passed the test.

32:26.077 --> 32:27.210
I wanted to make sure

32:27.212 --> 32:28.345
You'd fight for me.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.113
Damn right I'd fight for you.

32:32.216 --> 32:33.483
Wha...?

32:33.485 --> 32:35.118
Mmm! The party.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.219
I have to get ready.

32:36.221 --> 32:37.955
We'll sneak away later?

32:41.592 --> 32:43.060
I'll see you later.

32:43.062 --> 32:44.594
Uh-huh.
Mmm...

32:44.596 --> 32:46.163
(gentle laugh)

32:53.037 --> 32:55.005
(sighs heavily)

33:01.212 --> 33:04.982
Latin lover narrator:
<i>But there would be no later.</i>

33:04.984 --> 33:07.217
<i>Not for them.</i>

33:17.328 --> 33:19.196
â™ª

33:21.766 --> 33:24.001
Your father is going to
love the renovations.

33:24.003 --> 33:27.070
He'll be so impressed
with what you've done.

33:30.274 --> 33:32.142
They got the marlin
right, finally.

33:32.144 --> 33:34.211
Can you imagine
if he showed up

33:34.213 --> 33:36.046
To an ice sculpture
of a wizard?

33:36.048 --> 33:37.547
(laughs)

33:39.717 --> 33:42.119
You know what?
I am so sick of this.

33:45.056 --> 33:46.490
Maybe you're right.

33:46.492 --> 33:48.558
Maybe this can't be salvaged.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.127
But I can't take this.

33:50.129 --> 33:51.695
You standing there,
all sanctimonious.

33:51.697 --> 33:53.497
Uh-huh...
Yes, I did something terrible.

33:53.499 --> 33:55.232
But you know what?
You did something
terrible, too!

33:55.234 --> 33:57.701
And what did I do?

33:58.669 --> 34:00.103
What did I do?

34:01.639 --> 34:04.274
Tell me.

34:07.545 --> 34:10.113
You stopped loving me.

34:10.115 --> 34:11.381
I remember the day, actually.

34:11.383 --> 34:13.450
I'm sure it started
happening earlier.

34:13.452 --> 34:15.585
I'm sure I just registered it
on this day, but...

34:15.587 --> 34:17.821
You were halfway
through your chemo.

34:17.823 --> 34:19.489
And it seemed like you
had a nice enough visit

34:19.491 --> 34:21.591
From your sister, but after
she left, you came out,

34:21.593 --> 34:24.761
And you were looking
around and...

34:24.763 --> 34:26.830
And when you looked at me...

34:28.232 --> 34:29.633
(quiet sigh)

34:29.635 --> 34:32.335
...It felt as if
everything had changed.

34:33.771 --> 34:35.172
But I honestly hoped

34:35.174 --> 34:36.640
That this baby would be

34:36.642 --> 34:38.809
A real chance for us.

34:38.811 --> 34:42.279
Because you might've
stopped loving me.

34:42.281 --> 34:45.082
But I never stopped loving you.

34:47.318 --> 34:50.353
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Turns out, it's easy</i>
<i>to give a good performance...</i>

34:50.355 --> 34:53.690
<i>When what you are saying</i>
<i>is actually true.</i>

34:57.328 --> 34:59.396
(romantic music playing nearby)

35:07.138 --> 35:08.371
Can I come in?

35:08.373 --> 35:09.773
What's with the music?

35:09.775 --> 35:13.743
Well, I wanted
to do something for you.

35:13.745 --> 35:16.413
Like some big
telenovela gesture.

35:16.415 --> 35:17.781
Fill the whole
room with flowers

35:17.783 --> 35:19.382
Or leopards or something.

35:19.384 --> 35:20.550
But there are
budget restrictions.

35:20.552 --> 35:22.853
So...

35:25.723 --> 35:28.325
When the guy comes to the
girl to say he screwed up,

35:28.327 --> 35:30.660
There's always this dramatic
I-screwed-up music.

35:30.662 --> 35:33.763
So this is my dramatic
I-screwed-up music.

35:34.832 --> 35:37.434
I listened to your message.

35:37.436 --> 35:39.536
And you're right.

35:39.538 --> 35:41.805
I made this about
me and not you.

35:41.807 --> 35:44.207
Of course you should
keep your job.

35:44.209 --> 35:46.443
You should do whatever
you need to do.

35:46.445 --> 35:47.677
(quiet laugh)

35:47.679 --> 35:50.247
I'm really sorry.

35:50.249 --> 35:51.748
Wait. That...

35:51.750 --> 35:54.818
That thing you said about
everything changing?

35:54.820 --> 35:56.853
That's not fair.

35:56.855 --> 35:58.522
How much I love you?

35:58.524 --> 35:59.890
That is not changing.

36:03.895 --> 36:07.564
You got some good music
to kiss to in there?

36:10.635 --> 36:12.736
Oh, yeah.

36:12.738 --> 36:15.805
I got the best music to kiss to.

36:27.185 --> 36:30.921
I wanted to give you this.

36:30.923 --> 36:33.924
Divorce papers I assume.

36:33.926 --> 36:36.193
It's the sonogram
of the baby.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.797
Look, we've both made mistakes.

36:40.799 --> 36:43.900
And I don't know
if we'll get past them.

36:47.638 --> 36:49.539
Let's give it a try.

36:58.749 --> 37:00.817
Well, you can't
blame me for being

37:00.819 --> 37:02.752
A little jealous though, right?
I mean, the guy's like...

37:02.754 --> 37:05.455
Well, let's put it this way,
your mom was drooling over him.

37:05.457 --> 37:07.224
First of all,
my mom drools over everybody.

37:07.226 --> 37:08.892
And second?
So not my type.

37:08.894 --> 37:10.961
Way too pretty, right?
I mean... Just super pretty.

37:10.963 --> 37:12.929
Super pretty.
(laughs): Super.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.764
Hey.

37:14.766 --> 37:16.800
Trust me.

37:16.802 --> 37:19.970
You have nothing
to be jealous of.

37:28.579 --> 37:30.647
Just be happy for me.

37:30.649 --> 37:32.249
I love him, mother.

37:32.251 --> 37:35.252
I actually think
we can fix this.

37:35.254 --> 37:38.521
But what about the other man
you whored yourself to?

37:38.523 --> 37:41.524
You are a selfish girl.

37:41.526 --> 37:44.828
After I sacrificed
everything for you?

37:44.830 --> 37:46.997
Stop, mother.

37:46.999 --> 37:48.965
I'll figure it out.
(gasps)

37:48.967 --> 37:51.001
Oh, enough with
the tarot cards already!

37:51.003 --> 37:53.937
(laughs)
oh, don't be dramatic.

37:53.939 --> 37:56.473
I'm playing solitaire.

37:56.475 --> 37:58.975
I already
read the cards.

37:58.977 --> 38:01.811
I already know this outcome.

38:01.813 --> 38:03.413
Would you go
back to your room, please?

38:22.900 --> 38:24.301
Shouldn't you be in there?

38:27.371 --> 38:31.041
Yeah, just kind of taking
a moment, pre-game.

38:31.043 --> 38:33.443
Understood.

38:37.548 --> 38:40.317
So, you should know...

38:40.319 --> 38:41.851
I'm gonna sue your sister.

38:41.853 --> 38:44.587
I went back and forth,
but she screwed up.

38:44.589 --> 38:46.923
And she needs to permanently
lose her license

38:46.925 --> 38:48.591
And admit her
wrongdoings and...

38:48.593 --> 38:51.428
You should sue.

38:51.430 --> 38:53.930
And don't worry, it's got
nothing to do with me.

38:53.932 --> 38:57.067
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Except that his hotel</i>
<i>was on the line.</i>

38:57.069 --> 38:59.336
I'm glad you understand.

39:01.105 --> 39:03.373
I also...

39:03.375 --> 39:04.708
I wanted to thank you.

39:04.710 --> 39:07.110
What you said before about

39:07.112 --> 39:10.413
Not avoiding something,
due to fear...

39:10.415 --> 39:12.982
I needed to hear it.

39:12.984 --> 39:14.718
Are you gonna start writing?

39:14.720 --> 39:16.519
Hey, if that's
what I want to do,

39:16.521 --> 39:18.021
I gotta go for it, right?

39:18.023 --> 39:19.923
Like you, like my mom...

39:19.925 --> 39:21.691
Like your mom?

39:21.693 --> 39:23.560
Yeah, you know, it's funny
that you mention her.

39:23.562 --> 39:25.028
Did I mention her?

39:25.030 --> 39:26.563
Not really the point.
She's a singer.

39:26.565 --> 39:27.897
(laughs)
and she's really good,

39:27.899 --> 39:30.033
And she just has never
really gotten her big break,

39:30.035 --> 39:31.534
And she said that
there was gonna be

39:31.536 --> 39:33.069
A huge producer in
your hotel next month...

39:33.071 --> 39:34.504
You want an introduction?

39:34.506 --> 39:35.905
I want her to perform here.

39:35.907 --> 39:37.774
I'm trying to look

39:37.776 --> 39:40.744
At the bright side,
like you said.

39:40.746 --> 39:43.113
Of course.

39:45.015 --> 39:47.984
Cool.

39:49.086 --> 39:50.720
I should probably get to work.

39:50.722 --> 39:52.389
Yeah.

39:52.391 --> 39:55.158
I'll... I'll walk with you.

40:13.944 --> 40:16.713
(low, indistinct conversations)

40:18.783 --> 40:20.550
Rafael:
I am so sorry.

40:20.552 --> 40:22.619
I'll tell her
to leave right now.

40:24.555 --> 40:25.989
What are you doing here?

40:25.991 --> 40:28.091
I invited her.

40:28.093 --> 40:31.761
Dad. I don't know if you know
what's been going on here...

40:31.763 --> 40:33.563
Of course I know.

40:33.565 --> 40:37.100
Your sister made a very
unfortunate mistake.

40:37.102 --> 40:40.136
But she wasn't drinking
and that's important.

40:40.138 --> 40:41.771
An "unfortunate mistake"?

40:41.773 --> 40:43.440
Dad, I don't understand
why you coddle her...

40:43.442 --> 40:44.774
That's not true.

40:44.776 --> 40:46.843
You do understand.

40:47.978 --> 40:49.012
Luisa is family.

40:49.014 --> 40:51.848
And family is everything.

40:51.850 --> 40:53.049
And speaking of...

40:58.622 --> 41:01.624
Hello, darling.

41:01.626 --> 41:03.593
Luisa.

41:12.736 --> 41:14.070
Xiomara! Xiomara!

41:22.179 --> 41:23.246
Ooh, mommy!

41:23.248 --> 41:25.515
<i>Â¿el presidente?</i>

41:28.953 --> 41:31.120
You could actually
get really rich from this.

41:31.122 --> 41:32.155
You do realize that.

41:32.157 --> 41:33.223
I'm not doing this
to get rich.

41:33.225 --> 41:34.958
I mean, I can handle rich.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.059
Rich wouldn't be the
worst thing in the world.

41:36.061 --> 41:38.094
Okay, in the meantime,

41:38.096 --> 41:39.696
We've got some ideas.

41:39.698 --> 41:42.065
Changes we'd like
to see at the hotel.

41:42.067 --> 41:45.034
Since it seems like
you kind of have pull.
