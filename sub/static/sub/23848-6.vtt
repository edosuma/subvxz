WEBVTT

00:17.320 --> 00:19.160
<i>Previously on Babylon Berlin.</i>

00:19.240 --> 00:22.280
And this is
what happened to us in Oranienstrasse.

00:22.360 --> 00:23.600
The official version.

00:23.680 --> 00:27.080
"Some of the communists were shooting
at myself and Detective Rath."

00:27.160 --> 00:28.080
Are you serious?

00:28.480 --> 00:30.840
No-one is writing
"the police were attacked."

00:30.920 --> 00:32.080
But we'd need proof.

00:32.160 --> 00:33.760
An injured policeman.

00:36.920 --> 00:39.720
They only ever made one copy
of each of König's films.

00:39.800 --> 00:41.040
<i>The courier always took them.</i>

00:41.360 --> 00:43.080
<i>Krajewski? He used to be one of us.</i>

00:43.160 --> 00:44.240
A police officer.

00:44.320 --> 00:48.440
He honestly thought he could just
go back to working after the war.

00:49.120 --> 00:50.560
<i>The snazzy guy from Cologne.</i>

00:50.640 --> 00:53.560
He's a bit too curious for my liking.

00:53.640 --> 00:54.960
What's he to do with me?

00:55.040 --> 00:57.040
<i>Find out what he's looking for.</i>

00:58.120 --> 01:00.320
Must have got under a car.

01:00.400 --> 01:02.080
<i>He wasn't a tough guy,</i>
<i>I realized that too late.</i>

01:02.240 --> 01:04.200
<i>-You want to investigate?</i>
<i>-It's not that easy.</i>

01:04.560 --> 01:07.240
<i>Pretending to be police and breaking</i>
<i>into a flat is not a mistake.</i>

01:08.000 --> 01:10.920
-It's worse. You lied to me.
-I did not.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.040
By the way,
Kardakov was still there last night.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.440
-Where, in Berlin?
-In Sorokina's flat.

01:15.960 --> 01:17.920
<i>So he really didn't leave the city.</i>

01:18.000 --> 01:19.560
What do you want from me?

01:19.840 --> 01:21.640
The Sorokins' gold.

01:28.400 --> 01:29.680
Where is the gold from?

01:35.120 --> 01:36.240
From Russia.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.320
And what do you want to use it for?

01:44.320 --> 01:45.480
Mr. Kardakov.

01:45.960 --> 01:47.440
Stretch it once more.

01:58.480 --> 01:59.560
Move it.

02:13.560 --> 02:15.480
-Done, Edgar.
-Thank you, doctor.

02:27.360 --> 02:29.560
My country is doomed.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.440
I must help prevent this.

02:37.080 --> 02:39.360
That's what I need the gold for.

02:48.440 --> 02:49.760
I promise...

02:50.920 --> 02:54.040
this deal will be
more than worth your while.

03:04.600 --> 03:05.520
Please.

03:06.600 --> 03:07.600
Help me.

03:57.360 --> 03:58.240
Gereon?

03:59.880 --> 04:00.920
Are you alive yet?

04:03.120 --> 04:04.120
<i>Oh, pardon.</i>

04:04.200 --> 04:06.480
<i>Désolé! Dobré ráno. Scusi.</i>

04:07.920 --> 04:09.160
Fancy a newspaper?

04:10.080 --> 04:13.600
"Police officer close to death,
communists continue to deny."

04:14.080 --> 04:15.880
A question at an inopportune time?

04:16.080 --> 04:17.040
Yes.

04:17.760 --> 04:20.240
This colleague of yours, that Dörr guy,

04:20.320 --> 04:23.240
who was shot
during the Communists' demonstration.

04:23.320 --> 04:24.720
Would have been... Is alleged to...

04:25.080 --> 04:28.560
Could have been...
Anyway, it's all becoming a tearjerker.

04:28.960 --> 04:29.880
So I thought...

04:29.960 --> 04:31.760
POLICE OFFICER CLOSE TO DEATH
COMMUNISTS CONTINUE TO DENY!

04:32.000 --> 04:34.280
...maybe you could tell me
which section the guy belongs to?

04:35.880 --> 04:37.640
So I can find out his address.

04:37.720 --> 04:41.160
At the press conference
they were as silent as monks.

04:42.160 --> 04:45.320
I don't know... I don't even know him.

04:47.960 --> 04:49.080
Well...

04:50.280 --> 04:55.280
Just in case you came across something
and would hand me such details,

04:55.360 --> 04:58.080
as soon as they came around the corner...

04:58.160 --> 05:00.320
-You're championing the sub...
-Subjunctive.

05:00.400 --> 05:01.600
Would come, could, would.

05:01.680 --> 05:04.000
German grammar. Fantastic, isn't it?

05:05.080 --> 05:07.640
I'm also a police officer, Mr. Katelbach.

05:07.720 --> 05:08.920
But a good one.

05:10.040 --> 05:15.280
I thought it may be worth revealing the
truth about 1 May. Don't you want that?

05:16.840 --> 05:19.120
-What makes you say that?
-I can tell from looking at you.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.440
Either way, in exchange,
I would have tickets for the Plumpe.

05:24.120 --> 05:25.000
You what?

05:25.080 --> 05:27.680
The stadium on Gesundbrunnen.
Hertha BSC versus Holstein Kiel.

05:28.640 --> 05:30.600
"A hand is washed only by the other"
in this city.

05:30.680 --> 05:34.840
You'd think! In sites of civilization,
in your beautiful city on the Rhine,

05:34.920 --> 05:38.200
or in my modest home town on the Danube,

05:38.280 --> 05:40.200
friends help each other.

05:40.440 --> 05:43.240
Only the Berliners don't get it.
That's terrible.

05:50.280 --> 05:51.480
What's the time?

05:53.360 --> 05:54.320
Seven.

05:55.400 --> 05:56.680
Dear God.

05:58.840 --> 06:00.040
It's Sunday.

06:07.360 --> 06:10.480
ACADEMIC ROWING CLUB
LAKE WANNSEE

06:53.720 --> 06:55.760
-What are you writing?
-A novel.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.320
Want to go out on the boat?

06:58.680 --> 07:00.360
-Just the two of us?
-Yes.

07:00.720 --> 07:01.600
I'd love to.

07:04.160 --> 07:08.040
You look droll in your swimming dress.
Where did you get it?

07:08.480 --> 07:09.480
At the carpet shop?

07:11.080 --> 07:13.960
-No, she looks like a walrus.
-Legs don't look slim in that.

07:17.600 --> 07:20.000
No, here on your forehead.

07:20.080 --> 07:22.360
Give it to me. How does this work?

07:22.680 --> 07:25.280
-Look.
-That won't stick.

07:25.400 --> 07:27.400
-No, like this.
-Hey, sporting ace.

07:28.040 --> 07:29.160
But it won't stick.

07:29.280 --> 07:30.960
Here, on your forehead like this.

07:32.240 --> 07:33.880
Like this, look.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.280
Hello.

07:36.280 --> 07:38.440
Greta, Rudi. Rudi, Greta.

07:38.520 --> 07:39.920
-Hi.
-Hi.

07:41.560 --> 07:44.040
-What about the first swim?
-I've been in already.

07:44.840 --> 07:45.680
Shame.

07:45.760 --> 07:48.400
Come on, Stefan. Show us what you got.
Stand over there.

07:48.480 --> 07:49.480
Come on.

07:50.560 --> 07:53.200
I beg your pardon? That's silly.

07:59.840 --> 08:00.960
-Far enough?
-Yes.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.880
And now you tell her something.

08:02.960 --> 08:05.200
In a normal voice. Don't shout.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.040
Oh, it's cold.

08:19.000 --> 08:19.840
That much?

08:20.040 --> 08:22.520
Find out for yourselves, churchy types.

08:23.400 --> 08:24.760
Who is he?

08:25.280 --> 08:26.600
A nitwit.

08:27.760 --> 08:29.720
So, what did I say?

08:30.000 --> 08:32.920
Ten Saxon revelers
pay twelve Czech checks.

08:33.640 --> 08:34.480
What about me?

08:34.680 --> 08:37.360
Why does Jänicke
bring proles to the club?

08:37.640 --> 08:39.160
-Right?
-Yes.

08:39.240 --> 08:40.240
How do you do it?

08:40.480 --> 08:44.160
-He can lip-read. His father is blind.
-Deaf, you moron.

08:45.320 --> 08:46.240
Not bad.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.480
And, do you like him?

08:50.120 --> 08:51.160
What makes you say that?

08:52.160 --> 08:54.120
-Well...
-Let's race!

08:54.480 --> 08:55.880
Mixed fours.

08:56.040 --> 08:57.800
-Coming!
-Coming!

08:58.720 --> 09:01.840
Three... two...

09:19.280 --> 09:22.560
Mass executions are a legitimate tool
of the revolution.

09:23.240 --> 09:24.920
Says who? Hitler?

09:25.320 --> 09:26.360
Lenin.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.360
Expropriation, too, by the way.

10:26.600 --> 10:32.320
<i>In nomine patris et filii</i>
<i>et spiritus sancti</i>

10:33.160 --> 10:36.800
<i>Amen</i>

10:49.320 --> 10:50.160
Mr. Rath.

10:51.160 --> 10:53.440
-Glad you could make it.
-Mr. Councillor.

10:53.520 --> 10:57.720
Oh please. Today, the councillor
is also a civilian, just like you.

10:57.800 --> 11:00.160
Irmgard, this is Mr. Rath,
the colleague from Cologne.

11:00.240 --> 11:03.080
-Nice to meet you.
-Did mass uplift you?

11:03.680 --> 11:05.480
Be careful with what you say.

11:07.800 --> 11:08.960
Thank you, it was beautiful.

11:09.320 --> 11:12.720
A little... different from the Rhine area.

11:12.800 --> 11:15.200
You mean... more composed?

11:15.440 --> 11:16.480
Maybe.

11:16.720 --> 11:19.280
Well, the Märkisch diaspora.

11:20.160 --> 11:23.240
We're having guests for coffee later,
if you would like to come?

11:23.480 --> 11:25.120
Thank you, but I have work to do.

11:25.600 --> 11:26.880
I'll give you the day off.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.480
Then I'd love to. You'll let the inspector go first, ok?

11:33.200 --> 11:34.080
Go ahead.

11:36.840 --> 11:38.200
-After you?
-Me?

11:38.560 --> 11:41.560
Oh, it's not for me. It's not my club.

11:41.640 --> 11:43.560
My husband's family is Jewish

11:43.640 --> 11:45.760
and he refuses to get baptized.

12:10.840 --> 12:13.600
In the name of the Father and the Son
and the Holy Spirit, amen.

12:13.680 --> 12:14.760
Amen.

12:23.240 --> 12:26.280
God's eternal mercy
will always forgive you, my son.

12:26.760 --> 12:27.720
I know.

12:32.240 --> 12:36.240
Talk to me, my son. After the first step,
the second one is easy.

12:42.480 --> 12:45.160
If you don't want to,
come back some other time.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.320
The doors of this house
are always open to you.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.680
I love my brother's wife.

13:20.240 --> 13:21.200
Does he know?

13:23.320 --> 13:25.160
No. He is lost without a trace.

13:26.600 --> 13:27.480
Missing.

13:30.920 --> 13:33.280
Has this led to indecent actions?

13:35.880 --> 13:36.720
Yes.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.920
Over a long period of time?

13:39.960 --> 13:41.240
For over ten years now.

13:43.880 --> 13:45.600
This is a heavy burden.

13:45.960 --> 13:50.360
The ninth commandment is an important
component of our Christian integrity.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.720
Is there more, my son?

14:07.040 --> 14:09.040
JOB POSTING Have you talked to Stefan
about the job yet?

14:14.560 --> 14:19.000
Hey, Stefan! I didn't know
you personally know Benda.

14:20.200 --> 14:23.240
Sure, he's the chief
of the political police.

14:24.240 --> 14:27.040
-See?
-I have an interview tomorrow.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.240
Good! Hey, student!

14:55.360 --> 14:57.120
Me? No.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.000
-What are you reading then?
-Pardon?

14:59.080 --> 15:00.160
What are you reading?

15:00.760 --> 15:02.240
Just looking at pictures.

15:03.600 --> 15:06.200
-Are you from Usedom?
-No, Darss. And you?

15:07.080 --> 15:08.480
-Wismar?
-No.

15:09.160 --> 15:10.360
Stralsund.

15:12.600 --> 15:15.520
Hey, what are you doing?
That's not your boat.

15:15.600 --> 15:16.920
We are the Kiel sailors.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.600
We're doing revolution.

15:18.680 --> 15:20.320
You can't do that!

15:20.400 --> 15:22.880
-Come along. Read to us.
-No way.

15:26.480 --> 15:27.480
Help!

15:30.160 --> 15:32.480
-Quick! Help!
-Let's go, guys.

15:32.560 --> 15:35.680
-They're stealing our boat!
-Kidnapping!

15:36.000 --> 15:37.240
Wait, I'll get you!

15:39.560 --> 15:40.560
Faster!

15:42.400 --> 15:45.400
-What are you doing?
-Help me!

15:45.480 --> 15:48.280
-I'm being kidnapped!
-You'll have to endure it!

15:59.160 --> 16:00.240
We're rid of them.

16:04.080 --> 16:06.720
-I'm Fritz.
-Greta.

16:08.360 --> 16:10.560
Greta. Nice name.

16:10.640 --> 16:11.720
Otto. Hello.

16:26.480 --> 16:28.720
Cold, but fair.

16:31.840 --> 16:32.880
Listen...

16:34.280 --> 16:37.840
-You're in medical school, right?
-Forensic pathology with Dr. Schwarz.

16:38.680 --> 16:40.440
Do you cut open bodies and look into them?

16:40.520 --> 16:41.880
That's almost all we do.

16:44.360 --> 16:46.080
-Seriously?
-Sure.

16:46.160 --> 16:47.720
I cut them open in my sleep.

16:49.120 --> 16:50.160
Why do you want to know?

16:52.320 --> 16:53.240
Just do.

16:53.760 --> 16:55.720
Maybe the two of us
are up to something later.

16:56.960 --> 16:57.880
I see.

17:02.400 --> 17:03.920
<i>Please help yourself.</i>

17:04.200 --> 17:07.400
I'm sorry,
but our maid was married off over night.

17:08.240 --> 17:10.760
-Can I help you?
-No, thank you.

17:11.320 --> 17:12.840
A woman doesn't unlearn this.

17:14.520 --> 17:16.520
Rath, there you are.

17:16.840 --> 17:19.280
Have you met our chief employer?

17:20.320 --> 17:21.760
We haven't been introduced.

17:22.360 --> 17:25.600
Chief of police Zörgiebel,
Inspector Rath from Cologne.

17:25.680 --> 17:26.680
I am honored.

17:27.560 --> 17:29.880
Rath, the son of Engelbert?

17:30.920 --> 17:33.880
You owe me a report for the first of May.

17:34.280 --> 17:35.960
I'm working on it.

17:36.160 --> 17:39.360
The fact that you were shot at,
the danger...

17:40.000 --> 17:43.920
the self-defense situation you
and your colleague were in,

17:44.000 --> 17:45.920
you have to emphasize that.

17:46.800 --> 17:51.560
I expect your written statement
regarding those events tomorrow morning.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.320
You're shaking.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.080
<i>I'm cold, too.</i> <i>We need help!</i>

19:38.960 --> 19:40.080
You can't go there.

19:40.920 --> 19:41.840
I can.

20:13.640 --> 20:14.480
Just like that.

20:16.680 --> 20:19.440
-Pardon?
-The constabularies.

20:20.280 --> 20:21.920
That's where they were shooting from.

20:24.520 --> 20:25.640
And they were dead.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.720
But no revolution,

20:32.800 --> 20:34.040
the party says.

20:52.240 --> 20:53.400
What are you doing here?

20:54.120 --> 20:55.960
-Mr. Nowak.
-Are you snooping around?

20:56.280 --> 20:58.440
-I'm sorry.
-He's one of them.

20:58.760 --> 21:00.320
-A copper?
-Yes.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.440
-What did he say?
-A copper?

21:02.520 --> 21:03.840
-Get out.
-A policeman?

21:03.920 --> 21:05.360
-A policeman?
-Get out, murderer.

21:05.440 --> 21:08.560
-Murderer.
-Get out.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.440
-Hands off.
-Get lost, you bastard. Come on, let it go. Come on.

21:15.680 --> 21:17.080
Next time I'll kill you.

21:43.680 --> 21:46.680
Honored guests, dear comrades,

21:48.320 --> 21:50.960
I welcome you all

21:51.880 --> 21:54.600
here in the ancestral home of our family.

21:55.640 --> 21:57.720
I'm particularly happy

21:57.800 --> 22:01.320
that the lady of the house
is joining us today.

22:02.640 --> 22:05.760
The general director Annemarie Nyssen.

22:06.360 --> 22:07.400
Mother.

22:16.760 --> 22:21.560
Hunting is the actual passion of man,
apart from war.

22:22.600 --> 22:27.800
Today we welcome the esteemed personal
advisor of the President of the Reich,

22:28.200 --> 22:29.680
Colonel Wendt,

22:29.800 --> 22:32.840
and also one of the great heroes
of the previous war,

22:34.040 --> 22:36.160
the conqueror of Memel,

22:36.240 --> 22:38.720
and the hero of the Battle of Heidekrug,

22:39.120 --> 22:40.720
Major General Seegers.

22:51.240 --> 22:54.560
How come the Soviets suddenly
put a hold on the delivery in Berlin?

22:54.640 --> 22:57.680
The embassy's Bolshevik
is talking of some sort of...

22:58.480 --> 23:01.440
I don't know.
Some kind of smuggling, allegedly.

23:01.960 --> 23:04.280
On Monday, the wagons will be searched.

23:04.360 --> 23:06.440
What? Why wait until Monday?

23:06.920 --> 23:09.080
Think of the freight.
You can't just open the hatches.

23:09.840 --> 23:14.080
You must make sure that this train
doesn't cause any kind of publicity.

23:14.160 --> 23:16.680
-My name is on the freight papers.
-Exactly.

23:17.080 --> 23:19.760
Anything that happens to this transport
between the national border

23:19.840 --> 23:24.400
and the Reichswehr's barracks
is solely your responsibility.

23:24.480 --> 23:29.440
You know this. And you knew it when you
agreed to support the national cause.

23:29.520 --> 23:31.920
Do you know what's at stake for me
when this gets out?

23:32.000 --> 23:35.040
Exactly. That's why the train
shouldn't stop here for long.

23:35.120 --> 23:40.680
Once the press or even the police
hears of our... I mean your activities,

23:40.760 --> 23:44.120
you won't just put yourself in jeopardy,
but the entire enterprise.

23:44.520 --> 23:49.360
Give the Russians whatever they want.
We'll do the rest. Right.

23:50.400 --> 23:52.120
And now pull yourself together.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.200
We are much obliged to the Nyssen family
and in particular your mother

23:56.280 --> 23:57.960
for making her estate available to us.

24:00.200 --> 24:03.440
And we want to see
what Colonel Wendt has prepared for us.

24:04.840 --> 24:07.560
When and where
is the exercise to take place?

24:07.640 --> 24:12.200
After dark, General.
In a valley behind those... hills.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.440
Oh, well. So we've got some time.

24:45.800 --> 24:46.760
Too far.

24:51.080 --> 24:53.120
I beg your pardon, Major General.

24:53.800 --> 24:54.960
I couldn't resist.

24:59.280 --> 25:02.600
200 meters are ambitious for you, too.

25:03.200 --> 25:04.200
On the contrary.

25:14.080 --> 25:16.400
We look forward to your exercise, Colonel.

25:21.560 --> 25:26.400
<i>At the second address on our list</i>
<i>in Oranienstrasse around number eight</i>

25:26.480 --> 25:28.360
<i>there were two women on a balcony.</i>

25:28.960 --> 25:33.440
<i>Shortly afterwards, several men unfurled</i>
<i>a red flag, four by six meters in size.</i>

25:34.600 --> 25:37.520
<i>At the same time,</i>
<i>the communists opened fire.</i>

26:00.920 --> 26:01.840
Rath.

26:04.120 --> 26:05.320
Who is this?

26:10.560 --> 26:11.560
Hello?

26:21.960 --> 26:22.800
Hello?

26:55.680 --> 26:57.360
This is Germany's hope.

27:01.480 --> 27:02.920
How many men are there?

27:03.960 --> 27:05.320
Four thousand.

27:09.400 --> 27:11.320
It's a very special exercise.

27:12.080 --> 27:13.000
Is it?

27:13.560 --> 27:16.840
We're calling it "Operation Prangertag".

27:30.160 --> 27:32.000
<i>That picture... We downed a few bottles,</i>

27:32.440 --> 27:34.920
<i>Helmut got on the horse,</i>
<i>straight down into the basement inn.</i>

27:35.240 --> 27:36.640
To the bar.

27:46.680 --> 27:47.520
Bruno?

27:48.840 --> 27:49.920
May I interrupt?

27:52.320 --> 27:53.680
I'll be right back.

28:05.440 --> 28:07.360
Today's the anniversary of Helmut's death.

28:08.720 --> 28:10.240
He was in my company.

28:10.320 --> 28:12.560
Fell in the battle of Zillebeke.

28:27.840 --> 28:30.960
He was a good one. Old Behnke.

28:44.600 --> 28:45.440
Bruno.

28:48.640 --> 28:49.960
I need your help.

28:53.520 --> 28:54.360
König?

28:58.120 --> 28:59.200
Finally.

29:04.760 --> 29:06.200
I have to find Krajewski.

29:09.560 --> 29:10.720
He's the key.

29:13.440 --> 29:14.720
Let's go then.

30:16.920 --> 30:19.080
What do you want? I need my stuff.

30:20.200 --> 30:22.400
Whom do you give the material
from the film lab?

30:23.920 --> 30:25.280
Which material?

30:27.760 --> 30:30.560
They'll finish me off, man.

30:37.440 --> 30:38.440
Where's the film?

30:38.880 --> 30:39.840
Patience.

30:41.880 --> 30:43.680
We have time. He doesn't.

30:58.040 --> 31:01.440
Now you'll see how long
you can manage without drugs.

31:02.640 --> 31:04.080
If you need anything, you'll call for service.

31:06.480 --> 31:09.480
This officer will come get us. Look.

31:10.080 --> 31:12.440
This is what I have for you when you sing.

31:13.960 --> 31:16.400
That's... too weak for me.

31:16.480 --> 31:19.760
-I... need something stronger.
-I see.

31:20.880 --> 31:24.960
I thought it was just the thing
for you shaking chickens.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.280
I need something stronger. Please!

31:47.000 --> 31:49.480
As you can see,
even broken machines can think.

31:49.560 --> 31:50.920
No doubt about that.

31:51.320 --> 31:53.120
You're living proof of that.

31:54.280 --> 31:55.720
And with your stuff...

31:56.680 --> 31:58.040
you have a grip on yourself?

31:58.520 --> 32:00.800
You tell me. You know me by now.

32:01.040 --> 32:02.240
If this gets out...

32:02.840 --> 32:05.480
-you're out, no debate.
-Do you think I'm a bad policeman?

32:08.560 --> 32:11.000
Come on. Let me give you a kiss.

32:11.160 --> 32:13.960
You're my favorite policeman.
You're the best policeman...

32:15.520 --> 32:16.440
I'm serious.

32:34.760 --> 32:35.960
Idiot.

32:36.800 --> 32:38.320
You're the idiot.

32:40.040 --> 32:41.960
Because you didn't trust me.

32:54.840 --> 32:56.480
Man, I'm parched.

32:57.160 --> 32:58.000
Come on.

33:15.560 --> 33:17.320
Another two hours.

33:38.600 --> 33:39.680
Hello?

33:41.760 --> 33:43.320
-Hands up!
-What's going on?

33:45.560 --> 33:47.280
-Hand over your weapons.
-Lie down.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.800
-Get down.
-Go on, get down.

33:52.200 --> 33:53.160
Lie down.

34:51.480 --> 34:53.600
-Yes.
-Let's go.

34:54.280 --> 34:55.200
Come with me.

35:51.400 --> 35:52.240
It's gas. Gas!

35:54.480 --> 35:56.640
Gas! It's gas!

36:00.320 --> 36:01.280
Let's go.

36:01.600 --> 36:02.880
Everyone out!

36:03.280 --> 36:04.640
Go on, get out!

36:06.480 --> 36:08.920
-Get to safety!
-Everyone out!

36:09.280 --> 36:10.160
Get out!

36:13.000 --> 36:14.840
Put gas masks on!

36:15.600 --> 36:16.600
Freeze!

36:24.840 --> 36:26.840
Come over here. We need to take him.

36:28.840 --> 36:29.800
Chin up!

36:32.680 --> 36:33.560
Let's get out of here.

36:41.920 --> 36:43.600
Quick! Paramedics!

36:44.080 --> 36:46.400
Hold on! Hold on!

36:52.760 --> 36:54.240
Is this the dead Russian?

36:55.800 --> 36:56.640
Yes.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.080
Will you close the door, please?

37:06.960 --> 37:09.240
You take the feet, they're still firm.

37:10.320 --> 37:11.800
Isn't he a bit heavy?

37:12.880 --> 37:16.160
Yes, you're right.
I'll let some gas out first.

37:41.160 --> 37:43.120
Oh, crap. Hold your nose.

37:43.280 --> 37:45.560
-What?
-Close your mouth!

37:47.160 --> 37:49.680
AMMONIUM SALT

38:09.400 --> 38:10.240
Kiss me.

38:20.840 --> 38:21.960
Better?

38:24.120 --> 38:25.160
And now?

38:25.240 --> 38:28.160
First we'll cause some carnage
and then I'll show you my pad.

38:29.080 --> 38:30.640
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

38:43.760 --> 38:45.280
Go straight to Dr. Schmidt.

39:03.880 --> 39:06.360
Right, miss, we're about to start.

39:07.360 --> 39:08.480
Just a second.

39:13.200 --> 39:14.920
Black mamba, but a proper one.

39:15.440 --> 39:18.120
-What does that mean?
-Come here, take a look.

39:26.360 --> 39:28.600
Here. Charcoal lungs.

39:29.640 --> 39:33.280
This guy was either a miner
or a railway worker.

39:40.360 --> 39:41.960
He can't have been a miner.

39:42.440 --> 39:43.720
Not with hands like this.

39:45.920 --> 39:46.880
Oh, crap.

39:48.000 --> 39:48.920
Help me.

39:51.360 --> 39:54.160
Are they nuts? Take me out of the opera?

39:54.960 --> 39:56.440
I had to go through the rows.

39:56.520 --> 39:59.880
We could have done this tomorrow.
We'd have cooled him.

40:00.680 --> 40:02.400
-And now?
-In there.

40:04.120 --> 40:05.600
The clothes!

40:06.800 --> 40:08.360
I don't go to the opera for that!

40:08.440 --> 40:10.800
Hurry up, they're coming. Come on.

40:11.200 --> 40:15.480
I don't need that. They're idiots,
I won't go to the opera again.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.680
There was a chemical accident tonight.

40:25.320 --> 40:28.800
One wagon of my train exploded.
At Anhalter freight yard.

40:30.480 --> 40:32.800
-Railway.
-Were you at the front line?

40:33.280 --> 40:35.520
123rd infantry division.

40:36.320 --> 40:37.160
Why?

40:37.680 --> 40:42.320
I've seen this a thousand times.
Looks much like a gas attack.

40:43.440 --> 40:46.760
Let's check the lungs for warfare agents.

40:51.720 --> 40:53.440
<i>Russian railway worker.</i>

40:54.920 --> 40:56.080
<i>Gas attack.</i>

40:57.160 --> 40:58.880
<i>Anhalter freight yard.</i>

41:09.680 --> 41:10.840
Well, inspector?

41:16.880 --> 41:18.600
So, everything alright?

41:19.000 --> 41:19.880
Yes.

41:20.600 --> 41:23.480
-All the ladies are registered?
-Sure.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.720
Then we're all good.

41:25.800 --> 41:27.120
You know it.

41:28.520 --> 41:30.640
A model establishment. Give my regards to the boss.

41:51.920 --> 41:54.840
The medication issue really
got the inspector's back up.

41:54.920 --> 41:55.960
You promised.

41:56.560 --> 41:57.640
What?

41:59.320 --> 42:01.520
The certificate of conduct. Spotless.

42:01.840 --> 42:04.160
Someone's got to find your paper first.

42:04.600 --> 42:06.160
I want to join the police, Bruno.

42:09.240 --> 42:10.400
But why?

42:13.160 --> 42:14.680
Because I know I'd be good.

42:15.120 --> 42:16.360
At investigating?

42:16.920 --> 42:17.760
Yes.

42:18.800 --> 42:20.720
Why don't you investigate the sleuth then?

42:21.880 --> 42:24.120
Then you'll get
your certificate of conduct.

42:26.680 --> 42:28.040
The Cologne guy didn't do it.

42:29.080 --> 42:31.640
But someone went through my desk.

42:33.200 --> 42:34.360
The day before yesterday.

42:51.880 --> 42:53.600
His condition is unstable.

42:58.120 --> 43:01.240
The train is full of gold.

43:02.040 --> 43:05.040
Only Svetlana knows.

43:05.120 --> 43:06.320
Get some rest.

43:06.440 --> 43:08.800
The train is full...

43:09.880 --> 43:13.480
Increase the dose.
Six milligrams morphine.

43:27.560 --> 43:28.640
And, will he make it?

43:30.280 --> 43:31.120
Yes.

43:46.240 --> 43:48.200
Why did you believe that man?

43:49.120 --> 43:51.160
I know him. He wouldn't lie.

43:58.640 --> 43:59.880
Comrades!

44:01.880 --> 44:03.400
Attention!

45:13.040 --> 45:15.360
<i>To ashes, to dust</i>

45:16.600 --> 45:18.800
<i>Stolen from the light</i>

45:20.400 --> 45:22.400
<i>But not yet now</i>

45:24.720 --> 45:27.640
<i>Miracles wait until the end</i> <i>It must be just a dream</i>

45:52.280 --> 45:56.840
<i>Trying to snatch the wind</i>

45:56.920 --> 46:00.480
<i>Who really knows?</i>

46:03.400 --> 46:06.440
<i>The clock on your wall</i>

46:07.000 --> 46:10.120
<i>It is filled with sand</i>

46:10.720 --> 46:13.800
<i>Put your hand in mine</i> <i>And let us be forever</i>

46:18.000 --> 46:20.680
<i>Now you make your choice</i>
