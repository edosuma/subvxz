00:56.745 --> 00:57.813
Hi.

00:59.347 --> 01:00.382
Work was good.

01:01.450 --> 01:02.450
I left on time.

01:04.385 --> 01:07.486
<i>I think the new woman, Allison,
might like me.</i>

01:07.488 --> 01:08.523
I don't know.

01:09.791 --> 01:11.494
<i>She keeps trying to talk to me.</i>

01:13.895 --> 01:17.497
<i>They started me on plans
for a new house in Greenwich.</i>

01:17.499 --> 01:19.132
<i>Ten thousand square feet.</i>

01:19.134 --> 01:21.433
Can you imagine?

01:21.435 --> 01:23.503
<i>No one needs
that much living space.</i>

01:25.407 --> 01:27.640
<i>He, she, it. Remember</i>

01:28.709 --> 01:31.010
<i>Let's see what else.</i>

01:31.012 --> 01:32.679
<i>Oh, I ran into Sarah
in the lobby</i>

01:32.681 --> 01:33.912
<i>and I helped her
with her groceries.</i>

01:33.914 --> 01:35.414
So, in case you see her,

01:35.416 --> 01:36.696
<i>that's why she loves you
so much.</i>

01:42.524 --> 01:46.593
<i>I made the rest of the chicken.
I hope you aren't sick of it.</i>

01:46.595 --> 01:47.460
It was gonna go bad soon

01:47.462 --> 01:49.528
and we can't keep
throwing out food

01:49.530 --> 01:50.565
and stay on budget.

02:01.643 --> 02:03.876
<i>So I'm not really sure
what's going on,</i>

02:03.878 --> 02:06.448
but I've been feeling
a little tired lately.

02:08.750 --> 02:09.818
Have you?

03:02.937 --> 03:04.771
<i>Yo, what's up, J?</i>

03:04.773 --> 03:08.208
<i>Uh, thanks for the heads-up
about Sarah.</i>

03:08.210 --> 03:11.013
<i>So the new girl, huh?
What's she like? Is she pretty?</i>

03:12.813 --> 03:14.012
Work was okay.

03:14.014 --> 03:17.016
Uh, I had to type up
this long deposition.

03:17.018 --> 03:18.920
<i>And then I got
a slice of pizza with Tom.</i>

03:20.788 --> 03:22.725
<i>He wanted to vent about his...</i>

03:23.591 --> 03:24.724
ex-girlfriend.

03:24.726 --> 03:26.659
<i>Apparently, she cheated on him,</i>

03:26.661 --> 03:28.560
<i>but he had cheated on her
all the time.</i>

03:28.562 --> 03:31.831
So, I just listened
and didn't comment

03:31.833 --> 03:35.702
<i>about all his contradictions
like you told me to.</i>

03:35.704 --> 03:38.237
<i>Biked through the park after,
which was fun.</i>

03:38.239 --> 03:40.707
<i>There's like some kind of tree
this time of year</i>

03:40.709 --> 03:42.742
that smells really good.

03:42.744 --> 03:44.010
Yeah.

03:44.012 --> 03:47.981
<i>Come to think of it,
I have been a little tired.</i>

03:47.983 --> 03:49.648
I don't know what it is.

03:49.650 --> 03:51.284
<i>I've been getting
my four hours.</i>

03:51.286 --> 03:54.587
<i>Actually, I was in bed
a few minutes early last night.</i>

03:54.589 --> 03:56.555
Yeah, right.

03:56.557 --> 04:00.760
<i>Anyway, I'm playing basketball
with the boys from the gym,</i>

04:00.762 --> 04:02.729
and then work.

04:02.731 --> 04:04.466
Seriously, Jonathan?

04:06.133 --> 04:11.237
<i>Would it be so bad
if you like this girl back?</i>

04:11.239 --> 04:13.273
<i>You're allowed
to be attracted to somebody</i>

04:13.275 --> 04:15.511
and have some fun.

04:17.678 --> 04:20.015
<i>All right, man, peace.
Have a good day.</i>

04:50.078 --> 04:51.614
Is everything okay?

04:53.814 --> 04:55.314
There was a slight drift.

04:55.316 --> 04:56.749
Just a few seconds,

04:56.751 --> 04:58.850
when you were switching
consciousness.

04:58.852 --> 05:00.121
Perez fixed it.

05:20.075 --> 05:22.176
I know you're feeling
off-balance.

05:23.677 --> 05:25.845
You're getting older.

05:25.847 --> 05:28.013
You each have busy lives.

05:28.015 --> 05:31.951
It's natural
that you're feeling tired.

05:31.953 --> 05:33.987
Don't worry.

05:33.989 --> 05:35.922
<i>I just got off the phone
with the Huntleys.</i>

05:35.924 --> 05:38.958
<i>They are very happy
with the renovations.</i>

05:38.960 --> 05:41.162
The house does make
a lot more sense now.

05:42.397 --> 05:45.999
So, I don't wanna be callous,
but, uh,

05:46.001 --> 05:49.936
how are things
with your sick relative

05:49.938 --> 05:53.773
- Uh, about the same.
- That's a shame.

05:53.775 --> 05:55.842
I was hoping to put you
on the West Side Tower project,

05:55.844 --> 05:57.913
but, uh, means working
a lot more hours.

06:00.015 --> 06:01.650
Yeah, I'm sorry, I can't.

06:02.984 --> 06:05.818
You are a fine draftsman.

06:05.820 --> 06:06.919
You know, I was happy
to hire you

06:06.921 --> 06:09.355
as a favor to Leslie,

06:09.357 --> 06:11.023
even though I knew
the time constraints.

06:11.025 --> 06:14.893
But if you want to be
an architect,

06:14.895 --> 06:16.664
you're gonna have
to figure something out.

06:25.407 --> 06:29.242
<i>Hans asked me to work
on the West Side Tower project.</i>

06:29.244 --> 06:30.979
I obviously can't.

06:33.248 --> 06:36.948
After work, I got some...

06:36.950 --> 06:39.688
chocolate gelato
from that place you like.

06:41.455 --> 06:43.157
I picked up some extra for you.

06:44.292 --> 06:45.693
It's in the freezer.

07:13.487 --> 07:14.789
Hey, J.

07:15.957 --> 07:17.256
Listen, man, I'm sorry.

07:17.258 --> 07:19.258
<i>I know how much you wanted
to work on that project.</i>

07:20.994 --> 07:24.866
<i>I understand you're frustrated.
I get frustrated, too.</i>

07:26.266 --> 07:29.037
<i>You know, it's like what you
and Dr. Nari talk about.</i>

07:31.039 --> 07:33.108
<i>We have our limitations, but...</i>

07:34.975 --> 07:36.008
<i>I guess if things
were different,</i>

07:36.010 --> 07:37.977
<i>you know, you'd have a career,</i>

07:37.979 --> 07:40.983
I could hike the Rockies.

07:42.850 --> 07:44.130
<i>But if you think about it,</i>

07:46.321 --> 07:51.090
<i>if you combined what each of us
do in our lifetimes,</i>

07:51.092 --> 07:53.359
put them together,

07:53.361 --> 07:56.095
we'll accomplish a lot
more than most people.

07:56.097 --> 07:57.232
Right?

08:03.071 --> 08:05.207
<i>Thanks for this by the way.
This is really good.</i>

08:07.508 --> 08:12.879
Grazie <i>for this gelato,
Jonathan.</i>

08:12.881 --> 08:15.116
<i>Feel better, man.
Don't worry about it.</i>

08:21.823 --> 08:25.158
<i>- C'est à droite.
- C'est droite.</i>

08:25.160 --> 08:29.028
<i>- C'est à gauche.
- C'est gauche.</i>

08:29.030 --> 08:31.129
<i>C'est à deuxime à gauche.</i>

08:31.131 --> 08:33.299
<i>C'est la...</i>

08:33.301 --> 08:36.202
<i>C'est à deuxime à droite.</i>

08:40.374 --> 08:41.940
A bird.

08:41.942 --> 08:43.044
Un oiseau.

08:44.845 --> 08:46.112
An orange.

08:46.114 --> 08:48.046
Une orange.

08:48.048 --> 08:49.848
I did the laundry.

08:49.850 --> 08:51.583
Uh, it was your turn,
but it was piling up.

08:51.585 --> 08:55.221
And your gym clothes stink.

08:55.223 --> 08:57.025
Are you using that deodorant
I got you?

09:00.228 --> 09:03.362
The guy with the gold chain
from the second floor was there.

09:03.364 --> 09:04.499
I didn't talk to him.

09:06.835 --> 09:09.037
I also...

09:10.571 --> 09:14.375
I found this in your pocket.

09:17.445 --> 09:19.381
I'm just wondering because...

09:21.249 --> 09:23.351
You didn't mention
that you went to a bar.

09:26.287 --> 09:27.989
Is that why we're tired?

09:29.590 --> 09:32.193
Have you been staying up late
and going to bars?

10:35.023 --> 10:38.256
Jonathan, really?

10:38.258 --> 10:40.593
<i>Not everything
is a fucking clue, okay?</i>

10:40.595 --> 10:44.664
<i>I told you. Tom's girlfriend
broke up with him.</i>

10:44.666 --> 10:47.400
<i>We went to a bar.
Yeah, one time.</i>

10:47.402 --> 10:50.035
<i>And I sat and had a soda.
I forgot to mention it.</i>

10:50.037 --> 10:51.440
Stop being so paranoid.

10:55.542 --> 10:58.678
<i>Anyway, I got eggs, I got milk,</i>

10:58.680 --> 11:02.481
<i>I got bread we like
from that place, um...</i>

11:02.483 --> 11:04.650
<i>I forgot to get the McCann's
and we're practically out.</i>

11:04.652 --> 11:06.054
So you can get that.

11:07.088 --> 11:08.521
<i>Have a good one.</i>

12:17.557 --> 12:18.557
Hey, John.

12:20.661 --> 12:22.594
She's not in until five today.

12:22.596 --> 12:24.497
Want a beer?

12:24.499 --> 12:25.968
No, thanks. I'm good.

12:28.268 --> 12:29.602
I'll let her know
you stopped by.

12:29.604 --> 12:30.638
No.

12:32.340 --> 12:36.242
I mean, that's fine.
I wanted to surprise her.

12:36.244 --> 12:37.642
Got it.

12:37.644 --> 12:39.013
Oh, John.

12:40.248 --> 12:41.450
Forgetting something?

12:42.682 --> 12:43.682
The game.

12:44.685 --> 12:46.684
Yeah, I'll be there.

12:46.686 --> 12:47.786
No, last night's.

12:47.788 --> 12:49.523
I told you
the Giants were gonna win.

12:50.792 --> 12:53.394
Right. Yeah, awesome game.

13:52.686 --> 13:54.152
Jonathan. Hey.

13:54.154 --> 13:56.390
- Mr. Crane.
- Call me Ross.

13:57.859 --> 13:59.558
Can I get a coffee?

13:59.560 --> 14:00.859
Thank you.

14:00.861 --> 14:02.761
Are you good?

14:02.763 --> 14:04.099
Yes, thanks.

14:05.166 --> 14:08.136
A tea drinker, huh?
I missed that in the report.

14:09.670 --> 14:11.837
Oh, I... It's all right.

14:11.839 --> 14:14.142
Relax, man.
It's just a little PI humor.

14:18.812 --> 14:21.914
When they told me you were both
the client and the mark,

14:21.916 --> 14:23.348
I was like, so what.

14:23.350 --> 14:25.519
I've seen lots weirder, but...

14:27.421 --> 14:28.421
Thank you.

14:31.225 --> 14:32.426
But what are you?

14:33.494 --> 14:35.761
A somnambulist or something?

14:35.763 --> 14:39.464
- Can I see the report?
- You're the customer.

14:39.466 --> 14:42.734
But you lead one boring life.

14:42.736 --> 14:46.304
Up at what, 7:00? 7:15?

14:46.306 --> 14:47.740
Out the door
like clockwork

14:47.742 --> 14:49.375
at 7:30 for a run.

14:49.377 --> 14:50.708
Everybody has a routine.

14:50.710 --> 14:53.679
Yeah, well, you run yours
like a German train.

14:53.681 --> 14:56.915
Ah, let's see.

14:56.917 --> 15:00.553
"At 8:30 p.m. on Tuesday,
subject, you.

15:00.555 --> 15:03.322
Left your building.
Walked three blocks.

15:03.324 --> 15:06.858
Picked up a deli coffee,
regular, no sugar.

15:06.860 --> 15:09.295
Got on the train and proceeded
to Madison and 56th

15:09.297 --> 15:11.396
where you work part-time
as a temp for the law firm

15:11.398 --> 15:13.933
of Crawford, Rubin, and DeNisio.

15:13.935 --> 15:15.101
In addition to working part-time

15:15.103 --> 15:18.473
in the architecture office
of Hans Lieber during the day.

15:21.642 --> 15:25.243
Uh, you left work at 1:37 a.m.,
came straight home.

15:25.245 --> 15:27.346
You didn't leave again
until your run at 7:30

15:27.348 --> 15:28.646
the following morning."

15:28.648 --> 15:31.217
Are there any nights
that I did anything different?

15:31.219 --> 15:34.453
Yeah, yeah. "On, uh, on Friday,

15:34.455 --> 15:36.324
you left work
a few minutes early,

15:37.624 --> 15:39.824
at, uh, 1:26 a.m.

15:39.826 --> 15:41.694
Instead of heading home
like you usually do,

15:41.696 --> 15:44.630
you went to The Rialto bar

15:44.632 --> 15:47.632
where you sat, and had two beers
until your girlfriend finished

15:47.634 --> 15:49.968
- her shift."
- Girlfriend?

15:49.970 --> 15:52.206
Well, if she's your sister,
I'm calling the cops.

15:53.807 --> 15:55.210
Or maybe a priest.

15:56.576 --> 15:58.212
Yeah, your girlfriend.

15:59.312 --> 16:00.514
Elena Kaminsky.

16:02.350 --> 16:04.250
"You stayed until after
the bar closed

16:04.252 --> 16:06.285
while she cleaned up,
and then went to her place,

16:06.287 --> 16:07.752
where, presumably,
you and she..."

16:07.754 --> 16:09.722
And how long did I stay
at her place?

16:09.724 --> 16:13.324
"You left at 5:50 a.m.
and ran home."

16:13.326 --> 16:14.828
I mean, you literally ran.

16:16.464 --> 16:17.766
What was the hurry?

16:18.798 --> 16:19.900
Do you have photos?

16:31.045 --> 16:33.548
Do you think
she's cheating on you, or...

16:36.750 --> 16:38.352
I still don't get this.

16:39.753 --> 16:41.453
I can keep an eye on her,

16:41.455 --> 16:44.323
but to me, she seems like
a good egg.

16:44.325 --> 16:45.326
How much do I owe you?

17:44.517 --> 17:45.783
<i>Hey, J.</i>

17:45.785 --> 17:48.419
<i>Work was slow tonight,
I mostly just talked to Tom.</i>

17:48.421 --> 17:50.422
<i>I took the subway
'cause it was raining.</i>

17:50.424 --> 17:52.890
<i>I helped a woman carry
her stroller down the stairs.</i>

17:52.892 --> 17:54.960
<i>Where she was going
with a baby at 2:00 a.m.?</i>

17:54.962 --> 17:57.396
I don't know.

17:57.398 --> 17:58.864
<i>Oh, we were running low
on dish soap,</i>

17:58.866 --> 18:00.799
so I picked some up.

18:00.801 --> 18:02.436
You got any plans
for the weekend?

19:08.769 --> 19:09.902
I went
to the Guggenheim

19:09.904 --> 19:12.538
to see the Le Corbusier exhibit.

19:12.540 --> 19:15.607
You should go.
It's open late on Saturdays.

19:15.609 --> 19:18.444
Afterwards,
I came straight home.

19:18.446 --> 19:21.483
I finished the game you started,
and I doubled your score.

19:43.204 --> 19:44.406
John?

19:45.238 --> 19:46.605
Hi.

19:46.607 --> 19:47.606
Hi.

19:47.608 --> 19:50.541
Never seen you
in the daylight before.

19:50.543 --> 19:53.145
Not sure how I feel about this.

19:53.147 --> 19:54.148
Really?

19:54.948 --> 19:56.214
Kidding.

19:56.216 --> 19:58.116
What are you up to?

19:58.118 --> 20:00.586
I was headed
to the dry cleaners.

20:00.588 --> 20:01.587
How about you?

20:01.589 --> 20:05.193
I was on my way to yoga,
but my aunt just called.

20:06.224 --> 20:07.704
She lost her keys again, so...

20:10.563 --> 20:12.030
Are you okay?

20:12.032 --> 20:14.668
Yeah, I'm just running late.

20:15.535 --> 20:16.770
To the dry cleaners?

20:18.105 --> 20:19.238
It's okay.

20:19.240 --> 20:20.608
You don't have to tell me.

20:25.111 --> 20:26.680
I'll see you tonight.

20:44.063 --> 20:46.999
<i>Thanks for the heads-up
about Elena, asshole.</i>

20:47.001 --> 20:50.034
<i>You think she wouldn't mention
that she ran into you?</i>

20:50.036 --> 20:52.003
<i>You know,
this whole routine thing</i>

20:52.005 --> 20:55.973
<i>and telling each other exactly
who we run into is your idea.</i>

20:55.975 --> 20:59.176
<i>I like her, yeah,
and I had to lie to her.</i>

21:22.602 --> 21:25.236
I assume you aren't
a total asshole

21:25.238 --> 21:28.874
and know you're the one
who's been lying to me.

21:28.876 --> 21:30.512
Why didn't you tell me
about her?

21:35.049 --> 21:36.280
It just happened.

21:36.282 --> 21:37.883
We met that night I went
to the bar with Tom.

21:37.885 --> 21:41.086
I didn't tell you because
I knew you'd disapprove.

21:42.755 --> 21:45.790
Yeah, of course I disapprove.

21:45.792 --> 21:47.928
<i>Having a girlfriend
is against the rules.</i>

21:51.698 --> 21:54.265
<i>I know, but what
am I supposed to do?</i>

21:54.267 --> 21:56.770
<i>I'm not like you, I can't just
turn off my emotions.</i>

22:01.875 --> 22:05.143
<i>You know how serious this is.</i>

22:05.145 --> 22:07.178
<i>You have to do something
about her.</i>

22:07.180 --> 22:09.182
<i>You have to break up with her.</i>

22:10.117 --> 22:12.984
I'm not gonna do that.

22:12.986 --> 22:15.287
<i>This girl's different.
I really like her.</i>

22:20.927 --> 22:22.994
That isn't the point.

22:22.996 --> 22:24.930
<i>If you're not
gonna break up with her,</i>

22:24.932 --> 22:27.201
then you at least have
to tell her about us.

22:28.369 --> 22:30.668
And if you won't, then I will.

22:37.744 --> 22:38.912
Don't do that.

22:40.113 --> 22:41.281
I'll tell her tonight.

23:52.985 --> 23:54.385
<i>I tried to tell her
about us.</i>

23:58.225 --> 23:59.359
I couldn't.

24:01.195 --> 24:04.098
Anyways, it's over.

24:08.936 --> 24:10.271
I hope you're happy now.

25:10.397 --> 25:13.231
I mean, what the fuck, John?

25:21.542 --> 25:25.210
Look, I don't know
what John told you,

25:25.212 --> 25:28.078
but knowing him,
it wasn't clear.

25:28.080 --> 25:30.348
What do you mean,
"Knowing him, it wasn't clear"?

25:30.350 --> 25:32.253
I'm not John, I'm his brother.

25:35.254 --> 25:37.088
You left my house,
like, two hours ago

25:37.090 --> 25:38.190
wearing the same clothes.

25:38.192 --> 25:39.290
Can you just leave, please?

25:39.292 --> 25:40.572
He doesn't wanna see you
anymore.

25:54.541 --> 25:55.906
It's his phone.

26:00.947 --> 26:02.215
What's going on?

26:03.617 --> 26:05.019
Can you just leave?

26:07.119 --> 26:08.121
John.

26:11.558 --> 26:14.592
John and I are brothers,
but we share the same body.

26:14.594 --> 26:16.328
Right now, he's asleep.

26:16.330 --> 26:17.799
Inside of me.

26:22.235 --> 26:24.034
Very funny.

26:24.036 --> 26:26.171
It's extremely rare,
but it exists.

26:26.173 --> 26:27.138
We take shifts.

26:27.140 --> 26:29.607
I'm conscious
from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.

26:29.609 --> 26:32.179
John's conscious
from 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.

26:38.284 --> 26:40.551
You know what, I've heard some
really crazy shit in my time,

26:40.553 --> 26:42.953
but this has to be
the fucking lamest!

26:42.955 --> 26:44.324
Craziest!

26:53.065 --> 26:54.501
How much did you drink
last night?

26:56.403 --> 26:58.569
I was sitting here, sick,
from your hangover.

26:58.571 --> 27:01.239
And there was a knock
at the door.

27:01.241 --> 27:04.242
Why does she think she has
carte blanche to come over here?

27:04.244 --> 27:05.342
How does she even know
where we live?

27:05.344 --> 27:07.948
Jesus! Do, do you know
how many rules you've broken?

27:14.687 --> 27:17.489
She's gone now.
I took care of it.

27:17.491 --> 27:19.393
She won't be coming back
here anymore.

27:21.160 --> 27:22.596
Can we get back
to normal, please?

28:30.296 --> 28:31.776
<i>She won't be coming back
here anymore.</i>

28:34.501 --> 28:36.037
<i>Can we get back
to normal, please?</i>

28:53.619 --> 28:55.653
<i>It's been four days.</i>

28:55.655 --> 28:56.721
I know.

28:56.723 --> 28:58.790
He's upset.

28:58.792 --> 29:00.759
Why is he upset?
He knows the rules.

29:00.761 --> 29:02.292
You're missing your brother.

29:02.294 --> 29:03.728
You can't grab him
by the shoulders

29:03.730 --> 29:05.129
and straighten him out.

29:05.131 --> 29:07.331
All you can do
is give him time.

29:07.333 --> 29:08.433
I, I don't understand.

29:08.435 --> 29:10.601
Why would he need time
away from me?

29:10.603 --> 29:13.573
You're different people,
he reacts to things differently.

29:15.708 --> 29:17.510
How are you? How's work?

29:21.180 --> 29:22.615
They want me to work full time.

29:23.617 --> 29:25.617
They like you, that's good.

29:25.619 --> 29:26.585
Uh, it's not good,

29:26.587 --> 29:28.787
because, obviously,
I can't work full time.

29:28.789 --> 29:30.624
They recognize your talent.

29:32.426 --> 29:36.194
I warned you, pursuing a career
would be difficult.

29:36.196 --> 29:37.662
You're just gonna have
to hold the whole firm

29:37.664 --> 29:39.233
to the hours you already keep.

29:41.635 --> 29:42.635
All set.

29:46.406 --> 29:49.744
Most siblings move on
and lead separate lives.

29:51.445 --> 29:52.377
In a sense,

29:52.379 --> 29:56.380
distance from him
is a, a rite of passage.

29:56.382 --> 29:59.117
Think of it less
as this turmoil

29:59.119 --> 30:01.155
and perhaps more
as an opportunity.

30:02.155 --> 30:03.657
An opportunity for what?

30:05.591 --> 30:07.695
To explore your life
away from his.

30:37.323 --> 30:38.792
<i>I paid the Con Ed bill.</i>

30:40.392 --> 30:41.859
<i>And the laundry
is piling up again.</i>

30:41.861 --> 30:43.263
I guess I can do it.

30:44.865 --> 30:47.165
I saw Dr. Nari.

30:47.167 --> 30:50.367
She said that distance
is a rite of passage.

30:50.369 --> 30:52.870
<i>I don't know what she means,
we don't have that luxury.</i>

30:52.872 --> 30:54.873
<i>You and I have to communicate.</i>

30:54.875 --> 30:56.811
<i>You can't just leave me
in the dark.</i>

31:29.542 --> 31:32.713
Some guy on Long Island
got fried playing golf.

31:37.850 --> 31:39.352
It's Jonathan.

31:48.762 --> 31:49.830
What's this?

31:50.730 --> 31:52.466
Open it to page 37.

32:00.840 --> 32:02.810
"Single body,
multi-consciousness"

32:04.410 --> 32:06.310
The author is our doctor.

32:06.312 --> 32:09.914
You want me to read
this all right now? I...

32:09.916 --> 32:10.916
I'm working.

32:14.253 --> 32:17.254
Just listen to me for a second.

32:17.256 --> 32:19.624
When we were a baby,
we wouldn't stop crying.

32:19.626 --> 32:22.426
And our mother abandoned us
at a hospital.

32:22.428 --> 32:23.830
Can you please...

32:24.965 --> 32:26.330
That's where we grew up.

32:26.332 --> 32:28.465
Strapped to a gurney
or heavily sedated

32:28.467 --> 32:30.801
because nobody could figure out
what was wrong with us,

32:30.803 --> 32:32.971
until Dr. Nariman came.

32:32.973 --> 32:34.438
She studied us 24/7,

32:34.440 --> 32:36.640
and she realized
what looked like chaos

32:36.642 --> 32:39.577
was actually two people
in one body.

32:39.579 --> 32:40.645
So she began to treat us.

32:40.647 --> 32:46.920
Therapy, hypnosis. medication,
and finally... this.

32:48.420 --> 32:50.788
I don't know
what John told you that was,

32:50.790 --> 32:53.457
but that... that's what
keeps us separated.

32:53.459 --> 32:55.361
It's like a timer for the brain.

32:58.031 --> 32:59.633
Why are you telling me this?

33:01.368 --> 33:04.237
Because I haven't... I haven't
heard from John in a week.

33:08.907 --> 33:12.042
I was wondering if
you'd make a recording for him.

33:12.044 --> 33:14.011
He won't listen to me.

33:14.013 --> 33:15.549
And, uh...

33:17.516 --> 33:21.351
He cared about you,
so maybe he'll listen to you.

33:21.353 --> 33:25.359
Just, um, just ask him
to come back.

33:27.026 --> 33:28.361
I'm, um...

33:29.462 --> 33:30.662
I'm looking at someone

33:30.664 --> 33:33.731
who my eyes think I knew
and cared about,

33:33.733 --> 33:36.236
who's looking at me
like I'm a total stranger.

33:41.073 --> 33:42.308
Please.

34:33.692 --> 34:35.559
<i>I was just about
to get some lunch.</i>

34:35.561 --> 34:37.128
Have you eaten yet?

34:37.130 --> 34:40.797
No, but I... have to go home.

34:40.799 --> 34:42.733
Right, you have, um...

34:42.735 --> 34:45.004
is it your dad
that you take care of?

34:46.806 --> 34:47.838
Uh...

34:47.840 --> 34:50.741
<i>What's going on? I...</i>

34:50.743 --> 34:54.878
<i>You seem... I don't know,
upset about something.</i>

34:54.880 --> 34:56.713
<i>It's my brother.</i>

34:56.715 --> 34:58.449
He's being an asshole.

34:58.451 --> 35:01.451
Yeah, I know.
I have two sisters.

35:01.453 --> 35:03.554
<i>You know,
Paula who's four.</i>

35:03.556 --> 35:07.558
<i>We're close, but we can also
fight like nobody's business.</i>

35:09.561 --> 35:10.830
Where are you?

35:29.449 --> 35:31.416
<i>You've gotta talk to me.</i>

35:31.418 --> 35:33.550
<i>How long is this going
to go on?</i>

35:33.552 --> 35:34.686
I'm your brother.

35:34.688 --> 35:35.686
<i>You can't keep holding
a grudge like this.</i>

35:35.688 --> 35:38.688
<i>The supermarket
was packed today.</i>

35:38.690 --> 35:41.793
I'm not really sure why,
maybe a storm is coming.

35:41.795 --> 35:44.094
I still managed to find
some nice vegetables.

35:44.096 --> 35:46.496
I did my usual Saturday.

35:46.498 --> 35:47.764
I went for a run,

35:47.766 --> 35:51.636
<i>and I went to the Met
to see the European paintings.</i>

35:51.638 --> 35:52.804
<i>On my way home,
I rode the elevator</i>

35:52.806 --> 35:54.038
<i>with the guy with gold chain.</i>

35:54.040 --> 35:56.174
<i>I bought some new
running shoes.</i>

35:56.176 --> 35:57.476
They were on sale.

35:57.478 --> 36:00.878
<i>I don't love the color,
but the support is amazing.</i>

36:00.880 --> 36:02.512
<i>If you'd like,
you can try them out.</i>

36:02.514 --> 36:04.782
<i>I am going to keep
leaving you messages</i>

36:04.784 --> 36:06.583
<i>even if I don't hear from you.</i>

36:06.585 --> 36:08.219
I miss you.

36:08.221 --> 36:10.087
And I'm lonely without you.

36:10.089 --> 36:11.588
<i>A woman was
on the sidewalk today</i>

36:11.590 --> 36:13.623
<i>with a kid who was screaming.</i>

36:13.625 --> 36:16.494
<i>And she was screaming at him,
which did not help.</i>

36:16.496 --> 36:17.628
<i>The two of them just kept
getting louder and louder.</i>

36:17.630 --> 36:19.663
<i>I ran into one of your friends
from the gym.</i>

36:19.665 --> 36:22.166
<i>I didn't know what to say.
So, I just...</i>

36:22.168 --> 36:23.233
<i>You've stopped making my bed</i>

36:23.235 --> 36:25.136
<i>and doing your half
of the chores...</i>

36:25.138 --> 36:26.237
<i>I'm thinking about getting
a tattoo.</i>

36:26.239 --> 36:27.605
...now I'm doing
all the cleaning

36:27.607 --> 36:29.172
and laundry every day.

36:29.174 --> 36:31.074
<i>Remember how awkward it is
if we're caught off-guard...</i>

36:31.076 --> 36:32.543
I don't know what today

36:32.545 --> 36:35.813
<i>because I haven't heard
from you.</i>

37:02.609 --> 37:05.511
She is tall.
<i>Elle est grande.</i>

37:06.578 --> 37:09.614
<i>Ils est beau. He is handsome.</i>

37:09.616 --> 37:11.949
- <i>Ils est beau.</i>
- Hello?

37:11.951 --> 37:13.052
<i>It's Elena.</i>

37:22.295 --> 37:25.730
I didn't have your number,
or I would have texted.

37:25.732 --> 37:27.201
I wanted to give this back.

37:31.036 --> 37:33.603
That day, when I bumped
into John on the street.

37:33.605 --> 37:35.038
It was you.

37:35.040 --> 37:36.509
You were following me.

37:38.143 --> 37:39.479
No, I wasn't.

37:40.813 --> 37:41.882
It was daytime.

37:49.922 --> 37:50.924
Are you hungry?

38:15.882 --> 38:18.519
How did you and John meet?

38:23.855 --> 38:25.024
He didn't tell you?

38:29.094 --> 38:30.061
No.

38:30.063 --> 38:33.096
He came into the bar
with a friend.

38:33.098 --> 38:34.734
John started telling a story.

38:35.935 --> 38:37.170
I think to cheer the guy up.

38:39.339 --> 38:43.009
And he became so...

38:43.842 --> 38:44.976
animated,

38:44.978 --> 38:48.878
that he had everyone around him
listening and laughing.

38:48.880 --> 38:52.148
Anyway, his friend
got real messy drunk.

38:52.150 --> 38:55.288
And the next day,
John came in to apologize.

38:58.023 --> 39:00.960
But... I knew he'd be back.

39:07.766 --> 39:09.235
I was following you that day.

39:10.837 --> 39:12.369
We have a rule.

39:12.371 --> 39:13.706
No girlfriends.

39:15.741 --> 39:17.907
How can you have
a rule like that?

39:17.909 --> 39:18.875
We share a body.

39:18.877 --> 39:20.645
The only way we can survive
is if we have

39:20.647 --> 39:23.016
total responsibility
to each other and no one else.

39:24.683 --> 39:25.785
What about sex?

39:29.054 --> 39:30.123
We can do that.

39:31.257 --> 39:32.889
Wow.

39:32.891 --> 39:36.661
You've given each other
the perfect male fantasy.

39:36.663 --> 39:38.931
Sex without
emotional attachment.

39:46.072 --> 39:48.175
John used to talk about
going away for the weekend.

39:50.043 --> 39:51.144
How would that have worked?

39:52.712 --> 39:53.746
It wouldn't.

40:04.156 --> 40:06.325
Why didn't he just tell me
about you?

40:10.362 --> 40:11.964
He didn't wanna scare you away.

40:21.040 --> 40:23.773
Can I have your number?

40:23.775 --> 40:24.844
Just in case.

40:27.246 --> 40:28.782
In case of what?

40:30.083 --> 40:31.952
In case I have to reach you.

41:40.152 --> 41:41.921
<i>This is Hans's office.</i>

41:43.322 --> 41:46.556
<i>I've met two geniuses
in my life.</i>

41:46.558 --> 41:48.994
Hans and Dr. Nari.

42:01.206 --> 42:02.875
This is what I want to show you.

42:07.279 --> 42:08.279
You made this?

42:10.817 --> 42:12.085
It's beautiful.

42:17.290 --> 42:21.358
There was a hawk's nest
up there,

42:21.360 --> 42:22.293
on that ledge.

42:22.295 --> 42:25.432
But, it's gone now.

42:33.873 --> 42:35.175
What are we doing here?

42:37.210 --> 42:38.608
I wanted to show you my model.

42:38.610 --> 42:40.813
New Entry

42:42.047 --> 42:43.047
Why?

42:46.384 --> 42:48.321
Because I've never
done that before.

42:53.125 --> 42:54.795
We shouldn't stay here too long.

43:03.168 --> 43:04.648
I went to the office today.

43:06.205 --> 43:08.507
I had to finish up some things.

43:11.110 --> 43:12.479
No run-ins to report.

43:13.545 --> 43:15.145
Except Ruben.

43:15.147 --> 43:16.547
He was putting up
the sign-up sheet

43:16.549 --> 43:18.315
for the exterminator.

43:18.317 --> 43:20.416
I haven't seen any roaches
since last summer.

43:20.418 --> 43:21.420
Have you?

43:28.393 --> 43:29.393
What have you been doing?

43:34.333 --> 43:35.402
Talk to me.

43:45.944 --> 43:47.464
How did you find this place?

43:49.415 --> 43:50.614
I wanted
to bring John here,

43:50.616 --> 43:52.319
but he always had an excuse.

43:59.025 --> 44:01.895
I come here
to figure out my future.

44:03.696 --> 44:05.130
And what have you figured out?

44:07.600 --> 44:09.368
I think I might go back
to school.

44:12.138 --> 44:13.469
For art therapy.

44:13.471 --> 44:15.639
Really?

44:15.641 --> 44:18.942
I know I can come off
as a bartender

44:18.944 --> 44:20.978
who doesn't know
what to do with her life.

44:20.980 --> 44:23.350
My family see me that way
and sometimes I do, too.

44:28.054 --> 44:30.190
The universe doesn't move
toward chaos.

44:31.290 --> 44:32.456
It moves toward order.

44:32.458 --> 44:34.618
Things have a way
of working themselves out.

44:38.964 --> 44:40.532
You're really
not him, are you?

44:45.203 --> 44:46.637
My aunt and uncle
own the building.

44:46.639 --> 44:48.108
They're giving me a good deal.

44:50.275 --> 44:52.611
She's got dementia
and I help take care of her.

44:57.049 --> 44:58.451
You have a lot of DVDs.

45:06.424 --> 45:09.125
Can we watch this one?

45:09.127 --> 45:10.263
Sure.

45:18.337 --> 45:19.539
What time is it?

45:20.639 --> 45:23.674
Uh, it's almost 4:30.

45:23.676 --> 45:25.608
- You'll be fine.
- I know, um...

45:25.610 --> 45:26.645
I'm never out this late.

47:12.585 --> 47:13.686
Hey, J.

47:15.855 --> 47:16.855
You okay?

47:18.790 --> 47:21.391
<i>You, uh,
didn't make a recording,</i>

47:21.393 --> 47:23.860
so I got worried about you.

47:23.862 --> 47:29.398
<i>Uh, after work I've wandered
around downtown,</i>

47:29.400 --> 47:31.071
listening to music.

47:31.770 --> 47:32.802
I was crossing the street

47:32.804 --> 47:34.837
<i>and I felt this hand
on my shoulder,</i>

47:34.839 --> 47:38.407
<i>and it pulled me back,
and this taxi zoomed by.</i>

47:38.409 --> 47:42.478
<i>It was this tourist lady
from, like, Texas or something,</i>

47:42.480 --> 47:44.480
<i>you know, when they have
their hair all done up.</i>

47:46.284 --> 47:47.784
<i>And she said, "Oh, I'm sorry,</i>

47:47.786 --> 47:49.656
<i>my maternal instinct
just kicked in."</i>

47:52.458 --> 47:55.261
<i>I mean, I was more embarrassed
than she was.</i>

47:59.697 --> 48:01.467
<i>I know you know
what I was thinking.</i>

48:05.436 --> 48:07.139
<i>Could have been her.</i>

48:11.310 --> 48:13.809
Remember when we used
to make those drawings?

48:13.811 --> 48:15.514
<i>Imagining what she looked like?</i>

48:18.350 --> 48:20.119
<i>I went around the corner and...</i>

48:21.886 --> 48:23.420
<i>leaned against the building.</i>

48:23.422 --> 48:26.159
<i>I felt the wind
just knocked out of me.</i>

48:29.228 --> 48:30.930
I'm not mad at you anymore.

48:34.799 --> 48:36.135
I'm sorry, man.

48:56.822 --> 48:57.891
John's back.

48:59.991 --> 49:02.261
That's good, isn't it?

49:17.509 --> 49:18.711
I'm glad he's back.

49:23.648 --> 49:25.250
But I think I'll miss you.

50:21.940 --> 50:23.340
Are you shaking?

50:32.051 --> 50:33.652
I've never done this before.

50:35.054 --> 50:37.889
I know I said we're allowed to,

50:39.657 --> 50:40.726
but I haven't.

50:47.900 --> 50:49.269
Take your shoes off.

50:58.409 --> 50:59.712
And your socks.

51:57.136 --> 52:00.503
<i>What does it feel like
when you switch?</i>

52:00.505 --> 52:02.139
Does it hurt?

52:02.141 --> 52:04.409
No.

52:05.143 --> 52:06.678
It's like falling asleep.

52:16.455 --> 52:18.422
<i>Hi.
After work I was hungry,</i>

52:18.424 --> 52:22.458
<i>so I got a sandwich
in the park with Allison.</i>

52:22.460 --> 52:24.494
Remember her? The new girl?

52:24.496 --> 52:27.367
<i>We were talking,
and then she kissed me.</i>

52:29.634 --> 52:32.735
Long story short,
we went back to her place.

52:32.737 --> 52:34.040
And, um...

52:36.542 --> 52:39.175
Now I know
what all the fuss is about.

53:22.587 --> 53:25.054
<i>Better late than never, man.</i>

53:25.056 --> 53:27.657
No, seriously, Jon,
I'm happy for you.

53:27.659 --> 53:29.429
That's great. Sex is...

53:30.061 --> 53:31.862
sex is great.

53:31.864 --> 53:35.498
<i>Anyway, I, um, talked
to this guy at the gym</i>

53:35.500 --> 53:37.567
who told me about
the security job

53:37.569 --> 53:40.737
on, uh, 28th and Broadway.

53:40.739 --> 53:42.771
I had a call with them

53:42.773 --> 53:45.275
<i>and it looks like it's a go,
so, yeah.</i>

53:45.277 --> 53:47.643
<i>I think it'll be good for me.
I need a change.</i>

53:47.645 --> 53:52.181
<i>And, uh, just me
for four hours.</i>

53:52.183 --> 53:53.516
No distractions.

53:53.518 --> 53:54.985
<i>We got a unique situation here,</i>

53:54.987 --> 53:58.458
<i>so I think it's time
that I embrace it.</i>

54:12.703 --> 54:14.673
- Do you have a minute?
- Sure. Come in.

54:20.679 --> 54:24.014
The West Side Tower
is a big opportunity for me.

54:24.016 --> 54:27.650
I can extend my day by an hour
if I come in at nine

54:27.652 --> 54:29.018
and leave at two.

54:29.020 --> 54:32.556
I can take my work home,
I'll work on weekends.

54:32.558 --> 54:33.993
And when I work, I really work.

54:35.226 --> 54:37.793
That's just not enough.

54:37.795 --> 54:39.829
You need to be
physically present

54:39.831 --> 54:40.963
throughout the day.

54:40.965 --> 54:42.902
I... I can do this.

54:44.670 --> 54:47.507
And Josh will be
against it, but...

54:49.741 --> 54:51.677
I'd like you
on the project, so...

54:57.848 --> 54:58.850
let's give it a try.

55:00.819 --> 55:02.585
What do you think?

55:02.587 --> 55:03.853
I really like it.

55:03.855 --> 55:05.355
Oh, good.

55:05.357 --> 55:07.659
I wasn't sure
and I wanted to be.

55:11.263 --> 55:12.764
You seem...

55:14.632 --> 55:15.667
uh...

55:17.168 --> 55:18.268
I don't know.

55:18.270 --> 55:20.739
Uh, different, more relaxed.

55:22.975 --> 55:25.777
I, I'm on a new project at work.

55:27.045 --> 55:28.945
The design is amazing.

55:28.947 --> 55:32.552
Uh, it actually
might be Hans's best.

55:33.985 --> 55:35.955
I shaved 16 seconds off my mile.

55:38.690 --> 55:41.060
And I'm thinking about taking
a life drawing class.

55:45.864 --> 55:47.867
How are things
between you and John?

55:52.737 --> 55:53.839
They're good.

55:55.040 --> 55:56.708
We're back to the routine.

55:57.942 --> 56:00.009
I'm glad to hear that.

56:00.011 --> 56:02.714
I don't like it when the two
of you aren't getting along.

56:04.181 --> 56:06.886
I let things slip before,
and that can't happen again.

56:09.087 --> 56:10.322
It's not safe.

56:33.779 --> 56:34.914
<i>I heard from Tom.</i>

56:37.014 --> 56:40.282
<i>Uh, he's getting married
to that...</i>

56:40.284 --> 56:44.420
<i>girl, you know,
the one he broke up with.</i>

56:46.190 --> 56:50.029
<i>He invited me to the wedding,
but it's at two o'clock.</i>

56:51.797 --> 56:53.032
Work was all right.

56:55.299 --> 56:58.434
<i>The only guy I saw
was this Chinese delivery guy.</i>

56:58.436 --> 56:59.904
<i>He didn't speak any English.</i>

57:02.973 --> 57:05.176
<i>So, I, uh, had no one
to talk to.</i>

57:09.413 --> 57:11.346
<i>I told Ruben about the clog
in the sink.</i>

57:11.348 --> 57:12.350
So,

57:14.085 --> 57:16.022
<i>he should be by tomorrow
to fix it.</i>

57:21.092 --> 57:23.125
- How's it looking?
- Good.

57:23.127 --> 57:25.328
I need another two hours.
I'll finish from home.

57:25.330 --> 57:26.996
Great.
What time are the clients here?

57:26.998 --> 57:29.235
- Uh, nine.
- Great.

57:39.076 --> 57:40.276
<i>Have you told him yet?</i>

57:45.951 --> 57:47.887
I don't want him
to disappear again.

57:51.089 --> 57:53.359
I just wanna know
that this is genuine.

57:55.192 --> 57:56.895
That this isn't just about John.

57:58.130 --> 57:59.130
It's genuine.

58:05.036 --> 58:06.172
Good.

58:08.473 --> 58:09.842
For me, too.

58:17.315 --> 58:20.119
I guess, in the meantime,
we're safe.

58:21.819 --> 58:23.855
It's not like he can
walk in on us.

59:12.304 --> 59:17.172
<i>So, I'm walking home
from work,</i>

59:17.174 --> 59:21.043
<i>and I run into this guy
on the sidewalk</i>

59:21.045 --> 59:22.781
who seems to know me.

59:23.915 --> 59:25.181
And he asked me,

59:25.183 --> 59:30.552
<i>how things worked out
between me and that girl.</i>

59:30.554 --> 59:32.957
And I say, "What girl?"

59:34.259 --> 59:35.360
And he says,

59:36.360 --> 59:37.360
"Elena."

59:38.230 --> 59:41.867
<i>And I say,
"How do you know Elena?"</i>

59:43.400 --> 59:45.467
Suddenly, he's evasive,
he starts walking away,

59:45.469 --> 59:46.603
and I grab him.

59:46.605 --> 59:49.471
<i>And I ask him again,
how he knows Elena.</i>

59:49.473 --> 59:53.108
<i>And he gets angry, and he says,
"You're crazy. Let go of me."</i>

59:53.110 --> 59:55.311
And I don't let go of him,

59:55.313 --> 59:56.849
<i>and he punches me in the face.</i>

01:00:01.453 --> 01:00:05.121
<i>You hired a goddamn detective?</i>

01:00:05.123 --> 01:00:06.891
And you had me followed?

01:00:10.228 --> 01:00:12.031
<i>What the fuck
is wrong with you?</i>

01:00:17.335 --> 01:00:19.235
<i>Miriam, David.
This is Jonathan.</i>

01:00:19.237 --> 01:00:20.906
Our newest addition to the team.

01:00:27.212 --> 01:00:28.848
Let's get back into this,
shall we?

01:00:34.118 --> 01:00:35.585
Excuse me.

01:00:35.587 --> 01:00:38.520
I need to get something
from my desk.

01:00:38.522 --> 01:00:39.557
Be right back.

01:00:54.538 --> 01:00:56.007
Jonathan.

01:00:57.442 --> 01:00:58.442
What's going on?

01:00:59.444 --> 01:01:01.643
I left my drive at home.

01:01:01.645 --> 01:01:03.445
What happened to your eye?

01:01:03.447 --> 01:01:04.884
I... I fell.

01:01:06.451 --> 01:01:09.188
Okay, I'm just trying
to be your friend.

01:01:11.322 --> 01:01:13.424
I got punched in the face.
It's complicated.

01:01:16.427 --> 01:01:17.960
Go home.

01:01:17.962 --> 01:01:19.264
I... I'll cover for you.

01:01:21.465 --> 01:01:22.567
Thank you.

01:01:42.686 --> 01:01:45.357
I was worried John
was enjoying his life too much.

01:01:47.558 --> 01:01:49.127
What are you talking about?

01:01:50.094 --> 01:01:51.728
What does that even mean?

01:01:51.730 --> 01:01:53.596
There used to be three of us,

01:01:53.598 --> 01:01:56.565
but he was keeping us
from functioning properly,

01:01:56.567 --> 01:01:58.203
so Dr. Nari had him removed.

01:02:01.706 --> 01:02:03.309
When we were nine years old.

01:02:09.413 --> 01:02:12.482
I was concerned that...

01:02:12.484 --> 01:02:14.583
if you and John continued
seeing each other,

01:02:14.585 --> 01:02:17.422
that he would resent me
and wanna have me removed.

01:02:19.690 --> 01:02:21.292
Removed is?

01:02:23.261 --> 01:02:24.263
Dead.

01:02:25.697 --> 01:02:26.697
She can do that?

01:02:29.299 --> 01:02:30.535
Yeah, she did do it.

01:03:01.398 --> 01:03:02.534
I'm sorry.

01:03:04.502 --> 01:03:05.704
About the detective.

01:03:09.674 --> 01:03:12.511
I knew you were seeing
somebody, and...

01:03:13.811 --> 01:03:17.616
I guess I wanted to take control
of the situation.

01:03:25.623 --> 01:03:27.025
The truth is...

01:03:28.759 --> 01:03:29.759
I...

01:03:31.429 --> 01:03:32.664
was jealous.

01:03:33.831 --> 01:03:35.534
It's always been easier for you.

01:03:37.701 --> 01:03:39.237
And I was afraid...

01:03:41.371 --> 01:03:45.808
that you wouldn't
be able to love

01:03:45.810 --> 01:03:47.246
somebody else

01:03:47.811 --> 01:03:49.744
and me

01:03:49.746 --> 01:03:51.350
at the same time.

01:04:10.368 --> 01:04:12.471
<i>What you did
was really messed up, man.</i>

01:04:13.904 --> 01:04:15.107
You're my brother.

01:04:16.875 --> 01:04:18.076
No one can replace you.

01:04:21.578 --> 01:04:25.083
<i>I wish you'd just asked
about Elena in the first place.</i>

01:04:29.353 --> 01:04:31.189
<i>Then again,
I should have told you.</i>

01:04:33.824 --> 01:04:35.393
The truth seems like

01:04:36.393 --> 01:04:38.263
it's so easy, but it's not.

01:05:08.759 --> 01:05:10.425
He's depressed?

01:05:10.427 --> 01:05:11.927
But why wouldn't anyone tell me?

01:05:11.929 --> 01:05:13.732
He was supposed to.

01:05:15.933 --> 01:05:17.268
Your eye looks better.

01:05:18.936 --> 01:05:21.603
How... How are these pills
gonna affect me?

01:05:21.605 --> 01:05:24.940
They generally have no effect
on someone who isn't depressed.

01:05:24.942 --> 01:05:26.442
Maybe it's his new job.

01:05:26.444 --> 01:05:28.911
You know John.
He needs to be around people.

01:05:28.913 --> 01:05:30.449
That could be part of it.

01:05:32.382 --> 01:05:34.983
Have I done anything
to upset him?

01:05:34.985 --> 01:05:37.221
Well, he hasn't said anything.
Have you?

01:05:43.261 --> 01:05:45.531
I've been seeing
his old girlfriend, Elena.

01:05:53.705 --> 01:05:57.239
You told me to explore my life
outside of his.

01:05:57.241 --> 01:05:58.676
We've talked about this,
Jonathan.

01:06:00.344 --> 01:06:03.945
You've always been fascinated
by the women John sleeps with.

01:06:03.947 --> 01:06:05.982
And now you're
actually seeing one of them?

01:06:05.984 --> 01:06:07.386
I love her.

01:06:09.621 --> 01:06:11.487
John's women
cannot represent John

01:06:11.489 --> 01:06:12.925
no matter how much
you want them to.

01:06:14.792 --> 01:06:16.295
You're leading her on.

01:06:19.998 --> 01:06:21.233
You have to tell him.

01:07:04.741 --> 01:07:06.544
There's something
I need to tell you.

01:07:39.377 --> 01:07:40.675
Hi.

01:07:40.677 --> 01:07:42.344
Uh, busy day.

01:07:42.346 --> 01:07:44.646
We're moving into phase two
of the tower.

01:07:44.648 --> 01:07:46.782
I skipped my run this morning
to go in early.

01:07:46.784 --> 01:07:48.420
But I'll run longer tomorrow.

01:08:22.886 --> 01:08:25.421
I can explain.

01:08:25.423 --> 01:08:27.143
We just watched
the security footage.

01:08:41.438 --> 01:08:42.707
You told him?

01:08:44.841 --> 01:08:46.408
- Excuse me, Isabel.
- It's okay.

01:08:46.410 --> 01:08:47.978
It's all right. Come with me.

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:51.883
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

01:08:55.553 --> 01:08:59.020
I don't mind you
seeing someone, in theory.

01:08:59.022 --> 01:09:02.457
But we can't have secrecy
between you two.

01:09:02.459 --> 01:09:04.527
He broke in
and destroyed my office.

01:09:04.529 --> 01:09:06.464
Oh, god. Is he all right?

01:09:07.596 --> 01:09:09.165
Is he all right?

01:09:09.167 --> 01:09:10.265
The fired me.

01:09:10.267 --> 01:09:13.502
Oh, my god. Of course,
that's all you cared about!

01:09:13.504 --> 01:09:16.505
You were seeing
his ex-girlfriend.

01:09:16.506 --> 01:09:19.506
- I was gonna tell him.
- But you didn't!

01:09:19.509 --> 01:09:22.644
- You didn't!
- You always take his side!

01:09:22.645 --> 01:09:24.715
I take the side
of the one who's right.

01:09:27.551 --> 01:09:29.121
Then I guess I'm always wrong.

01:09:34.658 --> 01:09:35.893
I already called her.

01:09:52.075 --> 01:09:53.544
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

01:09:55.312 --> 01:09:57.548
<i>I heard from her
and I know it's over.</i>

01:09:59.950 --> 01:10:01.152
I think she's right.

01:10:29.012 --> 01:10:30.448
You disappeared.

01:10:31.749 --> 01:10:32.818
And I was lonely.

01:10:35.785 --> 01:10:37.621
So I started hanging out
with Elena.

01:10:41.959 --> 01:10:43.658
I'm sorry.

01:10:45.663 --> 01:10:48.667
Anyways, that is over now.

01:10:51.168 --> 01:10:52.704
I hope you got your anger out.

01:10:55.806 --> 01:10:57.576
You are an asshole.

01:10:58.543 --> 01:10:59.878
You got me fired.

01:11:08.718 --> 01:11:09.855
What are we gonna do now?

01:11:26.169 --> 01:11:27.172
Hey.

01:11:30.141 --> 01:11:32.875
Listen, John cut his wrist.

01:11:32.877 --> 01:11:34.757
He cut our wrist?

01:11:38.249 --> 01:11:40.315
But he called.

01:11:40.317 --> 01:11:41.719
So it's a cry for help.

01:11:48.025 --> 01:11:49.828
I want you to come to the house.

01:11:52.062 --> 01:11:53.597
John can't be alone.

01:12:29.834 --> 01:12:31.836
Do you remember
that trip to Vermont?

01:12:33.169 --> 01:12:34.672
Yes, of course.

01:12:35.806 --> 01:12:37.308
But this isn't me, it's John.

01:12:38.808 --> 01:12:39.910
It is?

01:12:42.112 --> 01:12:43.711
It was evening.

01:12:43.713 --> 01:12:45.780
But it was summer.
John loves the summer.

01:12:45.782 --> 01:12:47.850
He can see the sun
for at least an hour every day.

01:12:47.852 --> 01:12:49.292
Plus, look at the shirt
he's wearing.

01:12:50.855 --> 01:12:52.287
He used to make you promise

01:12:52.289 --> 01:12:54.756
that the two of you would move
to Scandinavia.

01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:57.996
He loved that he could have
a full day of sun there.

01:13:01.932 --> 01:13:03.735
Is Marshall still in Palo Alto?

01:13:06.736 --> 01:13:07.871
Yes.

01:13:10.173 --> 01:13:12.408
And still in the seminary.

01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:13.945
Probably just to get back at me.

01:13:15.413 --> 01:13:17.712
Religion isn't all bad.

01:13:17.714 --> 01:13:19.284
I never said it was.
Just the...

01:13:20.316 --> 01:13:21.984
parts that interfere

01:13:21.986 --> 01:13:25.054
with science
or empirical evidence.

01:13:25.056 --> 01:13:26.056
Anyway...

01:13:27.825 --> 01:13:29.961
we're not speaking much
these days.

01:13:35.031 --> 01:13:36.868
You gave us our first home here.

01:13:43.039 --> 01:13:44.375
Have I ever thanked you
for that?

01:13:49.446 --> 01:13:51.882
Everything's gonna work out,
Jonathan.

01:14:29.053 --> 01:14:30.373
<i>Welcome to the suburbs.</i>

01:14:31.521 --> 01:14:32.923
It's been a while, huh?

01:14:34.525 --> 01:14:36.891
At least, you wouldn't
have to cook,

01:14:36.893 --> 01:14:39.027
for a change.

01:14:39.029 --> 01:14:41.066
And it'll be strange
to sleep in our old bed.

01:14:44.901 --> 01:14:46.234
Remember when we were 13,

01:14:46.236 --> 01:14:49.137
and you figured out
how to jerk off?

01:14:49.139 --> 01:14:51.442
You were so excited to teach me.

01:14:56.847 --> 01:14:59.113
I'm sorry you're unhappy.

01:14:59.115 --> 01:15:00.819
I'm sorry for everything.

01:15:03.521 --> 01:15:05.420
Do what she says.

01:15:05.422 --> 01:15:07.424
And feel better, okay?

01:15:09.093 --> 01:15:10.095
Please?

01:16:09.119 --> 01:16:11.022
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:16:12.388 --> 01:16:14.456
There's toast
and a hard-boiled extra egg

01:16:14.458 --> 01:16:15.991
if you want it.

01:16:15.993 --> 01:16:17.426
No, thanks.

01:16:17.428 --> 01:16:18.463
I'm fine.

01:16:21.598 --> 01:16:24.235
- Good morning.
- Morning.

01:16:26.370 --> 01:16:28.537
- D'you sleep well?
- Yeah, I took a pill.

01:16:28.539 --> 01:16:29.704
Mm.

01:16:29.706 --> 01:16:33.207
- D'you get any sleep?
- No, not really.

01:16:33.209 --> 01:16:34.244
How did it go with John?

01:16:42.352 --> 01:16:43.821
He wants to be removed.

01:16:44.621 --> 01:16:46.488
That's because he's depressed.

01:16:46.490 --> 01:16:47.655
You have to fix him.

01:16:47.657 --> 01:16:49.494
He's not a clock, Jonathan.

01:16:51.294 --> 01:16:53.530
It's complicated. It takes time.

01:16:55.298 --> 01:16:57.498
It used to be
you had the career goals

01:16:57.500 --> 01:17:00.002
and he had his fun.

01:17:00.004 --> 01:17:02.069
Then he met Elena
and he fell in love.

01:17:02.071 --> 01:17:03.572
He can't be removed.

01:17:03.574 --> 01:17:05.043
Let me finish.

01:17:07.244 --> 01:17:10.311
He tried to become like you

01:17:10.313 --> 01:17:13.183
and embrace your routine, but...

01:17:15.451 --> 01:17:17.685
But I'm not enough for him.

01:17:17.687 --> 01:17:21.158
It's not in John's nature
to be like you.

01:17:24.294 --> 01:17:26.394
He can't have a girlfriend

01:17:26.396 --> 01:17:27.930
and he can't have you.

01:17:27.932 --> 01:17:29.968
He feels so alone.

01:17:42.478 --> 01:17:45.546
I woke up this morning at 7:03.

01:17:45.548 --> 01:17:47.185
The timer's drifting again.

01:17:48.953 --> 01:17:50.888
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

01:17:53.123 --> 01:17:54.325
I'll take a look.

01:18:50.213 --> 01:18:51.581
<i>Hey, J.</i>

01:18:57.454 --> 01:18:58.734
<i>It was a beautiful night.</i>

01:19:00.190 --> 01:19:01.960
<i>You could actually see stars.</i>

01:19:03.727 --> 01:19:05.327
<i>I wish you could have seen it.</i>

01:19:22.346 --> 01:19:23.580
What are you doing up?

01:19:24.815 --> 01:19:26.150
I couldn't sleep.

01:19:28.252 --> 01:19:29.553
What are you making?

01:19:31.187 --> 01:19:32.522
Lasagna.

01:19:33.423 --> 01:19:34.658
It smells good.

01:19:36.293 --> 01:19:38.096
There'll be leftovers
for you tomorrow.

01:19:46.503 --> 01:19:47.672
Are you okay?

01:19:48.638 --> 01:19:50.074
I'm fine.

01:19:51.340 --> 01:19:52.543
You always say that.

01:20:03.087 --> 01:20:05.188
I used to worry about John.

01:20:07.156 --> 01:20:08.525
Because he...

01:20:09.759 --> 01:20:12.394
he had the night.

01:20:12.396 --> 01:20:14.665
And as I got to know him,
I realized...

01:20:15.833 --> 01:20:17.535
he is the night.

01:20:20.536 --> 01:20:25.243
I found myself
staying up later and later...

01:20:28.212 --> 01:20:30.181
just to keep him company

01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:32.316
and talk.

01:20:39.889 --> 01:20:42.660
You should get back upstairs.
It's almost seven.

01:21:33.810 --> 01:21:37.546
<i>I know you and Dr. Nari
are trying to help,</i>

01:21:37.548 --> 01:21:39.484
<i>but there's no other way out
for me.</i>

01:21:41.884 --> 01:21:43.687
<i>I don't wanna be here anymore.</i>

01:21:44.887 --> 01:21:47.354
Have me removed.

01:21:47.356 --> 01:21:50.194
<i>Or a week, a month, a year
from now I'm gonna...</i>

01:21:52.228 --> 01:21:53.630
<i>I'm gonna go off this bridge.</i>

01:21:56.833 --> 01:21:58.503
<i>I don't wanna take you with me.</i>

01:22:01.304 --> 01:22:02.903
You'll be fine.

01:22:02.905 --> 01:22:04.609
You'll be more than fine.

01:22:07.945 --> 01:22:09.179
Do it.

01:22:19.755 --> 01:22:22.756
<i>Jonathan, where are you?</i>

01:22:22.758 --> 01:22:23.925
Call me.

01:22:23.927 --> 01:22:25.663
<i>I need to know
you're all right.</i>

01:23:57.387 --> 01:23:58.787
Are you okay?

01:23:58.789 --> 01:23:59.889
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:26:17.060 --> 01:26:18.462
Jonathan.

01:26:20.996 --> 01:26:23.500
You're okay.
I'm just running some tests.

01:26:26.969 --> 01:26:28.609
You didn't remove him, did you?

01:26:31.208 --> 01:26:34.074
<i>Nobody is getting removed.</i>

01:27:00.203 --> 01:27:01.605
How... how's he doing?

01:27:11.248 --> 01:27:13.328
He wants you to know he's fine

01:27:14.651 --> 01:27:15.786
and not to worry.

01:27:19.121 --> 01:27:21.725
No. We replaced it.

01:27:22.859 --> 01:27:24.829
The device isn't the problem.

01:27:26.562 --> 01:27:30.467
John is, is still pushing
through into your shifts.

01:27:32.802 --> 01:27:34.737
But I'm not pushing through
into his?

01:27:38.708 --> 01:27:39.743
No.

01:27:42.712 --> 01:27:44.811
He's not doing it on purpose.

01:27:44.813 --> 01:27:45.883
It's just...

01:27:46.682 --> 01:27:48.049
happening.

01:27:48.051 --> 01:27:49.053
Why?

01:27:54.891 --> 01:27:56.823
I thought you were thriving

01:27:56.825 --> 01:27:58.993
and John was withering.

01:27:58.995 --> 01:28:00.498
But I was wrong.

01:28:06.002 --> 01:28:08.004
John is the one who's thriving.

01:28:12.676 --> 01:28:14.812
That's why the timer
has been drifting.

01:28:17.246 --> 01:28:21.149
But he was depressed.
He wanted to die.

01:28:21.151 --> 01:28:24.621
John's demons are as intense
as his passions.

01:28:25.989 --> 01:28:28.192
I don't think
he truly wanted to die.

01:28:30.593 --> 01:28:32.096
If he's the one
that's thriving...

01:28:35.731 --> 01:28:36.799
then I'm withering?

01:28:38.634 --> 01:28:40.134
John's shifts
are getting longer,

01:28:40.136 --> 01:28:42.172
yours are getting
progressively shorter.

01:28:45.909 --> 01:28:48.545
Your body can't support
both of you.

01:28:56.719 --> 01:28:58.755
I'm trying to reverse it.

01:29:03.125 --> 01:29:04.561
He's taking over.

01:29:06.929 --> 01:29:07.929
I'm dying.

01:29:23.847 --> 01:29:24.848
Does John know?

01:29:28.183 --> 01:29:29.887
I'm gonna keep working.

01:29:34.257 --> 01:29:36.390
No, stop.

01:29:36.392 --> 01:29:38.928
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it!

01:29:54.944 --> 01:29:56.080
I wanna go home.

01:30:00.083 --> 01:30:02.018
I just wanna be with John.

01:30:48.998 --> 01:30:54.338
Um, I'm supposed
to tell you not to worry.

01:30:56.772 --> 01:30:57.807
Where...

01:30:58.475 --> 01:31:00.808
where are we going?

01:31:00.810 --> 01:31:03.344
You really don't remember, huh?

01:31:03.346 --> 01:31:05.081
You said JFK.

01:31:32.475 --> 01:31:35.176
Hey. Hey, pull... pull over.

01:31:35.178 --> 01:31:36.443
What?

01:31:36.445 --> 01:31:37.814
Pull over.

01:31:54.364 --> 01:31:55.398
Hey!

01:32:08.178 --> 01:32:09.818
Hey, what's wrong with you, man?

01:32:11.548 --> 01:32:13.016
Are you gonna get sick?

01:32:17.219 --> 01:32:18.355
My meter's running.

01:32:28.231 --> 01:32:30.430
I'm supposed to ask you...

01:32:30.432 --> 01:32:32.301
if you're in pain. If it hurts.

01:32:36.071 --> 01:32:37.074
No.

01:32:38.842 --> 01:32:40.511
Just tell him I feel tired.

01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:06.803
He says he's glad
you're not in pain.

01:33:28.458 --> 01:33:30.127
Tell him I say goodbye.

01:33:34.196 --> 01:33:36.663
You and I were happier

01:33:36.665 --> 01:33:39.101
than two people
ever could have been.

01:34:18.273 --> 01:34:21.078
I'm supposed to say to you,
"Goodbye."

01:34:22.945 --> 01:34:24.513
And you two were happy.

01:34:39.027 --> 01:34:40.560
What's your name?

01:34:40.562 --> 01:34:41.562
Sembene.

01:34:43.499 --> 01:34:44.499
I'm John.

01:35:01.217 --> 01:35:02.486
Can you turn it up?

01:35:08.557 --> 01:35:10.091
Do you speak French?

01:35:48.466 --> 01:35:53.466
