WEBVTT

00:05.830 --> 00:08.139
( theme music playing )

01:51.310 --> 01:53.130
WE SHOULD HAVE
GONE TO TOSCANA

01:53.240 --> 01:55.936
INSTEAD OF SEEING
THIS STUPID PLAY.

01:56.040 --> 01:57.940
JANICE IS MY BEST FRIEND.

01:58.050 --> 01:59.574
THIS IS HER ONLY SON.

01:59.680 --> 02:02.012
I THINK IT WAS
VERY NICE OF HIM
TO INVITE US.

02:02.120 --> 02:03.439
HE'S USUALLY
A VERY PRIVATE PERSON.

02:03.550 --> 02:06.155
( groans )
I'M NOT GOING
TO GO FIND HIM AFI'ERWARDS

02:06.260 --> 02:09.354
- AND TELL HIM WHAT
A BRILLIANT DIRECTOR HE IS.
- YES, YOU ARE.

02:09.460 --> 02:12.395
WHY DO PEOPLE
INVITE ANYBODY
TO ANYTHING?

02:12.500 --> 02:14.149
- I HAVE NO IDEA.
- TWO, PLEASE.

02:14.260 --> 02:15.818
Actor:
LET'S GO HOME, MASHA!

02:15.930 --> 02:18.922
- I'M STAYING HERE TONIGHT.
- MASHA, LET'S GO!

02:19.030 --> 02:20.930
THE BABY
MUST BE HUNGRY.

02:21.040 --> 02:23.258
NONSENSE.
MATRYONA WILL
FEED HIM.

02:23.370 --> 02:26.669
IT'S A SHAME.
THREE NIGHTS NOW
WITHOUT HIS MOTHER.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.600
YOU ARE BECOMING
TIRESOME.

02:28.710 --> 02:30.940
- ( coughs )
- IN THE OLD DAYS, AT LEAST
YOU'D PHILOSOPHIZE,

02:31.050 --> 02:33.974
BUT NOW IT'S ALWAYS
HOME AND BABY,
HOME AND BABY.

02:34.080 --> 02:35.377
THAT'S ALL I EVER
HEAR FROM YOU.

02:35.480 --> 02:38.381
- LET'S GO, MASHA!
- GO YOURSELF!

02:38.490 --> 02:40.879
- (gasping )
- WHAT IS GOING ON?

02:40.990 --> 02:43.026
( coughs )

02:43.130 --> 02:45.883
Actor:
I'LL TRY.

02:45.990 --> 02:47.719
- PETER?
- Audience member: SHH!

02:47.830 --> 02:49.491
- Actor: WILL YOU COME
HOME TOMORROW?
- ( hacking )

02:49.600 --> 02:52.330
Masha:
YES, TOMORROW!
STOP BOTHERING ME!

02:52.440 --> 02:54.192
- ( gasping)
- WHAT'S THIS FOR, MAMA?

02:54.300 --> 02:56.962
- PYOTOR ASKED US--
- Wife: PETER?

02:57.070 --> 02:59.231
ASKED US...

02:59.340 --> 03:01.308
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH MY HUSBAND.

03:01.410 --> 03:03.605
- PLEASE, SHH!
- HE, UM...

03:03.710 --> 03:06.747
OH, UH, DID HE ASK US
TO MAKE UP A BED FOR HIM
IN KOSTYA'S ROOM?

03:06.850 --> 03:09.978
- Wife: HONEY, TALK TO ME!
- YEAH.

03:10.090 --> 03:11.682
OLD PEOPLE ARE
LIKE CHILDREN.

03:11.790 --> 03:14.384
- ( hacking )
- Actor: WELL, I'M GOING.
GOODBYE, MASHA.

03:14.490 --> 03:16.185
- GOODBYE, MOTHER.
_ UM--

03:16.290 --> 03:18.781
- Wife: PETER!
- OH MY GOD.

03:18.890 --> 03:21.290
NO!
( sobbing )

03:21.400 --> 03:25.097
WHAT SHOULD WE DO?

03:25.200 --> 03:27.566
- ( sobbing )
- Man: WHAT'S WRONG?

03:36.850 --> 03:39.444
( phone ringing )

04:05.110 --> 04:08.500
( ringing getting louder)

04:19.690 --> 04:20.884
HELLO?

04:20.990 --> 04:23.151
( woman whispering )

04:23.260 --> 04:24.921
HELLO.

04:25.030 --> 04:26.952
( static crackles )

04:27.060 --> 04:28.823
WHO IS THIS?

04:28.930 --> 04:33.230
- ( distorted voice )
- WHO IS THIS?

04:33.340 --> 04:35.296
WHERE IS MY WIFE?

04:35.400 --> 04:37.766
AND WHERE IS MY DAUGHTER?

04:42.010 --> 04:44.376
( phone rings )

04:46.350 --> 04:48.545
( ringing )

04:59.030 --> 05:00.156
HELLO?

05:00.260 --> 05:02.524
Nate, it's Maggie.

05:02.630 --> 05:05.463
ARE YOU OKAY?
WHAT'S WRONG?

05:05.570 --> 05:09.358
UM, I'M SORRY
TO BOTHER YOU.

05:09.470 --> 05:12.200
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHO ELSE TO CALL.

05:12.310 --> 05:13.607
THAT'S OKAY.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

05:13.710 --> 05:16.702
- Brenda: WHO IS IT?
- Oh, God.

05:20.050 --> 05:21.642
( giggles )

05:21.750 --> 05:25.447
Keith:
DAVID, I CAN'T FIND
THE SPORTS SECTION.

05:26.860 --> 05:29.886
- HAVE YOU SEEN IT
ANYV'NI-OERE?

05:29.990 --> 05:33.448
THE DELIVERY GUY PROBABLY
FORGOT TO PUT IT IN AGAIN.

05:33.560 --> 05:35.551
- HE STINKS.
- THEN I'M OUT OF HERE.

05:35.660 --> 05:37.491
I'M GONNA BE LATE
FOR ROGER'S.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.433
THAT'S FINE.
I HAVE EVERYTHING
UNDER CONTROL HERE.

05:40.540 --> 05:42.599
- Durrell: HAND IT OVER!
- YOU KNOW...

05:42.710 --> 05:46.202
I HOPE YOU'VE BEEN
NOTICING HOW MUCH I'VE
BEEN WATCHING MY TEMPER.

05:46.310 --> 05:48.278
I AM REALLY TRYING
TO BE PATIENT,

05:48.380 --> 05:51.474
- BUT THOSE BOYS ARE NOT EASY.
- YES, I KNOW THEY'RE NOT EASY.

05:51.580 --> 05:54.071
AND IF I FORGET
YOU REMIND ME ONCE A DAY.

05:54.180 --> 05:56.273
- ( sighs )
- ( Anthony laughs )

05:56.390 --> 05:59.553
WOULD YOU LISTEN TO HIM?
HE'S JUST A SWEET LITTLE KID,
BASICALLY.

05:59.660 --> 06:02.311
( Durrell laughing )

06:02.430 --> 06:05.729
YEAH, I GUESS SO.

06:05.830 --> 06:07.798
( snickers )

06:11.330 --> 06:12.934
- Yeah yeah.
- ( boys laughing )

06:13.040 --> 06:14.837
( sighs )

06:19.310 --> 06:21.801
DURRELL, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING NOW?

06:21.910 --> 06:23.548
- WATCHING TV!
- DAVID, TURN THAT OFF!

06:23.650 --> 06:26.517
I CAN'T FIND THE REMOTE.
I CAN NEVER FIND THE REMOTE!

06:28.050 --> 06:30.041
WHERE DID YOU FIND THOSE?

06:30.150 --> 06:33.950
THOSE TAPES WERE IN
A LOCKED BOX UNDERNEATH A PILE
OF OLD RALPH LAUREN SHEETS

06:34.060 --> 06:37.154
- UNDERNEATH OUR BED.
- THEN YOU KNOW WHERE
I FOUND THEM.

06:39.760 --> 06:41.455
UH...

06:41.560 --> 06:46.668
DURRELL, FROM NOW ON
WHEN SOMETHING IS
IN A LOCKED BOX

06:46.770 --> 06:50.103
UNDERNEATH
A PILE OF OLD SHEETS,
THAT MEANS IT'S PRIVATE.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.576
FINE.

06:53.910 --> 06:56.504
GREAT.

06:56.610 --> 06:58.669
Anthony:
CAN WE GET READY
FOR SCHOOL?

06:58.780 --> 07:02.238
- WE'RE GONNA BE
REALLY LATE AGAIN.
- SHIT. I MEAN, SHOOT.

07:02.350 --> 07:04.045
GET DRESSED, YOU GUYS.
COME ON. NOW.

07:04.150 --> 07:05.913
LET'S GO!
( claps )

07:07.820 --> 07:09.458
( sighs )

07:10.930 --> 07:13.854
THAT WENT WELL.

07:13.960 --> 07:16.326
Marianne:
HEY, KIRSTEN, ARE YOU
COMING TO DOC'S TONIGHT?

07:16.430 --> 07:19.069
YEAH, BABY!
I WAS GOING
TO MY PARENT'S,

07:19.170 --> 07:21.263
BUT THANK GOD, MY MOM
HAS A STAPH INFECTION.

07:21.370 --> 07:23.565
- HEY, JOHNNY, YOU COMING?
- YEAH, BABY.

07:23.670 --> 07:25.206
HOW ABOUT IT, CLAIRE?

07:25.310 --> 07:28.837
UH, HANG ON,
I JUST HAVE TO FINISH
THIS ONE THING.

07:32.050 --> 07:33.472
THERE.

07:33.580 --> 07:36.708
YEAH, A BUNCH OF US ARE
GOING TO DOC'S AFTER WORK.

07:36.820 --> 07:40.051
THE BAR IN THE MALL?
DOC HANNIGAN'S?

07:40.160 --> 07:42.879
THAT'S JUST 'CAUSE
IT'S THE CLOSEST PLACE,

07:42.990 --> 07:45.879
AND THEY HAVE PITCHERS.
EVERYONE FROM WORK
GOES THERE.

07:45.990 --> 07:47.696
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO...

07:47.800 --> 07:50.360
COME ON, CLAIRE.
YOU THINK YOUR SHIT
DON'T STINK?

07:50.470 --> 07:53.394
NO, I THINK
MY SHIT STINKS.

07:53.500 --> 07:56.060
GREAT.
SO YOU COMING THEN?

07:56.170 --> 07:57.728
UM, MAYBE ANOTHER TIME.

07:57.840 --> 08:01.731
OKAY, FINE.
I GUESS WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO TALK ABOUT YOU ALL NIGHT.

08:01.840 --> 08:04.502
( Kirsten laughs )
YEAH, BABY.

08:07.980 --> 08:09.982
( heavy sigh )

08:10.090 --> 08:12.445
Ruth:
THERE'S SOMETHING NICE
ABOUT BEING ALONE.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.609
IT'S LIKE FINALLY
I CAN JUST RELAX.

08:17.530 --> 08:19.486
I MADE GEORGE
THE FOCUS OF MY LIFE.

08:19.600 --> 08:23.229
FIRST WHEN WE GOT MARRIED,
AND THEN EVEN MORE SO
WHEN HE GOT SICK.

08:23.330 --> 08:25.025
IT'S JUST NOT HEALTHY,
RIGHT?

08:25.130 --> 08:27.928
MM, ONE PERSON'S "HEALTHY"
IS ANOTHER PERSON'S "SICK."

08:28.040 --> 08:30.531
SOME WOMEN HAVE TO MAKE
SOMEONE ELSE THE FOCUS
OF THEIR LIFE

08:30.640 --> 08:32.528
OR THEY LOSE THEIR MINDS.

08:32.640 --> 08:36.098
NO JUDGMENTS.

08:36.210 --> 08:39.771
IT'S AN EXCITING TIME FOR ME.
THERE'S A WORLD OUT THERE
I'VE BEEN MISSING.

08:39.880 --> 08:43.941
- ARE YOU MANAGING
TO KEEP YOURSELF BUSY?
- AM I EVER.

08:44.050 --> 08:46.211
THERE ARE SO MANY
CULTURAL EVENTS
IN THIS CITY

08:46.320 --> 08:47.981
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO PARTICIPATE IN.

08:48.090 --> 08:51.526
LAST WEEK, I LEARNED
ALL ABOUT CABBALA AT
THE SKIRBALL CENTER.

08:51.630 --> 08:55.157
AND DU'I'TON'S IN BRENTWOOD
IS HAVING A JAY MCINERNEY
READING THE DAY AFTER NEXT.

08:55.260 --> 08:58.661
- NOW WHO'S THAT?
- HE'S THE GUY WHO WROTE
"BRIGHT LIGHTS, BIG CITY."

08:58.770 --> 09:01.398
I KNEW
HIS OLD COKE DEALER.
SWEET GUY.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.434
IT'S THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY
OF THAT BOOK.

09:03.540 --> 09:06.259
I FIGURED IT WAS TIME
FOR ME TO FINALLY READ IT.

09:06.370 --> 09:10.443
OH, VICTORIA,
YOUR GET-TOGETHER IS
TOMORROW NIGHT ALREADY--

09:10.550 --> 09:13.041
DON'T WORRY,
EVERYONE'S INVITED.

09:13.150 --> 09:16.916
DO YOU NEED ANYTHING?
I COULD BRING MY FAMOUS
POTATO SALAD.

09:17.020 --> 09:18.749
THAT'S SWEET,
BUT PLEASE DON'T WORRY.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.249
EVERYTHING'S
TAKEN CARE OF.

09:20.360 --> 09:23.750
MM. MM.

09:23.860 --> 09:28.149
SO IT'S
BETWEEN THIS ONE
AND THIS ONE.

09:28.260 --> 09:29.818
WHICH ONE DO YOU
LIKE BETTER?

09:29.930 --> 09:32.899
- I LIKE THIS ONE.
- YEAH?

09:33.000 --> 09:34.934
- BUT--
- THIS ONE'S NICE TOO.

09:35.040 --> 09:37.235
EXACTLY!

09:37.340 --> 09:38.807
OH, THEY'RE
BOTH GREAT.

09:38.910 --> 09:41.071
- UM...
- ( cell phone rings )

09:41.180 --> 09:43.273
EXCUSE ME.
THANKS.

09:44.950 --> 09:46.747
HELLO?

09:46.850 --> 09:48.943
YES.

09:51.050 --> 09:52.654
YES.

09:55.090 --> 09:56.978
OKAY.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.091
( gulpS)
OKAY.

10:04.900 --> 10:07.289
SURE.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.061
( sighs )

10:09.170 --> 10:10.899
UH, THANKS.

10:13.810 --> 10:15.971
SO HAVE YOU DECIDED?

10:16.080 --> 10:18.640
UH, I'LL COME BACK
SOMETIME.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.709
David:
I DIDN'T HAVE THIS APPOINTMENT
IN THE BOOKS.

10:25.820 --> 10:27.913
Nate:
MAGGIE CALLED ME
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

10:28.020 --> 10:30.727
THE DECEASED IS
A FRIEND OF HERS
FROM CHURCH.

10:30.830 --> 10:34.197
- MAGGIE IS A QUAKER?
- YEAH.

10:34.300 --> 10:38.691
- GEORGE WAS A QUAKER?
- NO NO. SHE CONVERTED
WHEN SHE GOT MARRIED.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.462
WHAT EXACTLY ARE
QUAKERS?

10:41.570 --> 10:44.266
THEY'RE
VERY PEACEFUL...

10:44.370 --> 10:46.930
- YEAH WELL,
EVERYONE KNOWS _THAT.
- ( cell phone ringing )

10:47.040 --> 10:50.749
- HAVE YOU SEEN RICO?
- HE SAID HE HAD SOMETHING
IMPORTANT TO DO.

10:50.850 --> 10:52.340
I'LL BE RIGHT IN.

10:52.450 --> 10:56.011
HELLO?

10:56.120 --> 10:59.009
Dr. Melnick:
OBVIOUSLY THESE ARE NOT
THE RESULTS WE EXPECTED.

10:59.120 --> 11:02.419
BUT THERE'S NO REASON
TO ASSUME THE WORST.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.556
THE BLOOD TEST
WAS POSITIVE,

11:04.660 --> 11:08.949
WHICH INDICATES POTENTIALLY
THAT THE BABY MAY HAVE SOME
SORT OF DISORDER--

11:09.060 --> 11:10.027
LIKE WHAT?

11:10.130 --> 11:13.338
SUCH AS DOWN'S
OR SPINA BIFIDA.

11:13.440 --> 11:16.659
HOWEVER, THIS TEST IS
EXTREMELY INCONCLUSIVE.

11:16.770 --> 11:20.206
OVER 95% OF BABIES
WHO TEST POSITIVE HAVE
NEITHER OF THESE TWO THINGS.

11:20.310 --> 11:22.676
( chuckles )
SO WHAT'S THE POINT
OF IT THEN?

11:22.780 --> 11:24.577
TO GET MORE INFORMATION.

11:24.680 --> 11:27.478
GIVEN THESE RESULTS
I RECOMMEND WE DO
AN AMNIOCENTESIS.

11:27.580 --> 11:30.981
I DIDN'T EVEN WANT
TO TAKE THE STUPID TEST.
EVERYONE SAID IT WOULD BE FINE.

11:31.090 --> 11:34.548
I WANT
TO SCHEDULE THE AMNIO
FOR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

11:34.660 --> 11:37.959
- NO NEED TO PANIC YET.
- YEAH, RIGHT.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.520
Rico: HEY.

11:43.630 --> 11:44.665
HEY. WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HOME?

11:44.770 --> 11:46.965
WELL, UH...

11:47.070 --> 11:49.459
I MADE UP A STORY
AND GOT OFF OF WORK
FOR A FEW HOURS

11:49.570 --> 11:51.208
'CAUSE I KNEW IT WAS
YOUR DAY OFF.

11:51.310 --> 11:54.336
DAY OFF, RIGHT.
I WENT GROCERY SHOPPING,
CLEANED UP THE KITCHEN

11:54.440 --> 11:58.308
AND I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF
MY FOURTH LOAD OF LAUNDRY.
IT'S BEEN A REAL PARTY.

11:58.410 --> 11:59.911
YOU DON'T LOOK BUSY NOW.

12:00.020 --> 12:02.272
THIS IS MY FIRST CHANCE
TO GET A BREATH.
I'M READING.

12:02.380 --> 12:04.143
MM-HMM.

12:04.250 --> 12:05.808
- RICO?
- YEAH?

12:05.920 --> 12:08.684
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- TRYING TO RELAX YOU.

12:08.790 --> 12:12.658
I CAN RELAX MYSELF.

12:12.760 --> 12:15.593
AS LONG AS YOU'RE HERE
YOU CAN TAKE OUT YOUR STUFF
IN THE BACK CLOSET

12:15.700 --> 12:18.498
LIKE YOU SAID YOU WOULD
THREE DAYS AGO.

12:19.370 --> 12:21.463
OH.

12:21.570 --> 12:23.128
SURE.

12:27.280 --> 12:31.000
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU WOULDN'T GO OUT
WITH THOSE PEOPLE.

12:31.110 --> 12:33.442
SOMETIMES YOU THINK
YOU'RE BETTER THAN
EVERYONE ELSE.

12:33.550 --> 12:36.542
- ( sighs )
HOPEFULLY I AM.
- WELL, YOU'RE NOT.

12:36.650 --> 12:38.311
ANYWAY, I'M EXHAUSTED.

12:38.420 --> 12:41.685
I HAD NO IDEA DOING NOTHING
ALL DAY COULD BE SO TIRING.

12:41.790 --> 12:46.159
- WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE
I HAD SO MUCH ENERGY.
- ( slams fridge )

12:48.160 --> 12:50.720
BESIDES, I WANT TO TRY
TO DO SOME WORK TONIGHT.

12:50.830 --> 12:52.593
OH, WHAT ARE
YOU WORKING ON NOW?

12:52.700 --> 12:56.659
ACTUALLY, NOTHING.
I AM TOTALLY DRY.

12:56.770 --> 12:59.034
I HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN
TO MY DESK IN WEEKS,

12:59.140 --> 13:00.937
BECAUSE EVERY TIME
I SIT DOWN AND TRY
TO THINK

13:01.040 --> 13:04.498
OF HOW I WANT
TO EXPRESS MYSELF
I JUST COME UP EMPTY.

13:04.610 --> 13:06.077
IT'S LIKE
THIS GIANT ABYSS

13:06.180 --> 13:09.479
WITH TOTAL,
LIKE, STILLN ESS.

13:09.580 --> 13:13.289
IT'S KIND OF
THE LONELIEST FEELING
IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.

13:15.620 --> 13:18.180
OH.

13:18.290 --> 13:22.021
WELL, UH, YOU'D BETTER
HURRY UP AND CHANGE.

13:22.130 --> 13:24.291
DINNER WILL BE READY SOON.

13:25.330 --> 13:26.661
( phone ringing )

13:26.770 --> 13:29.193
THOSE STUPID
TELEMARKETERS!

13:29.300 --> 13:31.359
YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA
BECOME MORE INVOLVED

13:31.470 --> 13:33.734
IN THOSE ORGANIZATIONS
THAT GET THEM OUTLAWED.

13:33.840 --> 13:35.671
HELLO!

13:35.780 --> 13:38.248
( softly)
OH, HELLO, GEORGE.

13:38.350 --> 13:40.079
"COME OVER TONIGHT"?

13:40.180 --> 13:41.408
NO.

13:41.520 --> 13:44.409
I DON'T SEE WHY THIS--

13:44.520 --> 13:46.340
FINE.
I'M VERY BUSY,

13:46.450 --> 13:48.987
BUT I'LL TRY AND STOP BY
TOMORROW AFTERNOON.

13:49.090 --> 13:52.150
I'M SORRY, GEORGE.
I CAN'T CHAT NOW.

13:52.260 --> 13:54.296
OKAY. BYE.

13:58.300 --> 14:00.632
- IS HE OKAY?
- I'M SURE HE'S FINE.

14:00.740 --> 14:03.163
WHATEVER'S GOING ON WITH HIM
I'M NOT GONNA GET SUCKED
INTO IT.

14:03.270 --> 14:06.660
- I HAVE MY OWN LIFE NOW.
- MAYBE HE'S JUST LONELY.

14:06.770 --> 14:08.169
YOU SEEM A LOT MORE
SYMPATHETIC TO HIM NOW

14:08.280 --> 14:11.704
THAN YOU DID
WHEN HE WAS LIVING HERE.

14:11.810 --> 14:13.573
IT'S ALWAYS EASIER
TO BE NICE TO PEOPLE

14:13.680 --> 14:16.114
WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SEE THEM.

14:17.250 --> 14:19.138
( sighs )

14:20.420 --> 14:23.127
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT A INTEGER IS.

14:23.230 --> 14:24.583
I DO SO.

14:24.690 --> 14:25.987
- ( music playing loudly)
- * YADA YADA YADA

14:26.090 --> 14:28.024
* YADA YADA YADA...

14:28.130 --> 14:31.588
I MEAN,
I HAVE A BASIC IDEA
OF WHAT AN INTEGER IS.

14:31.700 --> 14:33.395
INTEGERS ARE NUMBERS...

14:33.500 --> 14:36.060
* BLAH BLAH BLAH...

14:37.140 --> 14:40.177
- AM I IN TROUBLE?
- OF COURSE NOT.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.635
BUT MAYBE YOU SHOULD
LISTEN TO YOUR MUSIC
IN THE OTHER ROOM.

14:42.740 --> 14:46.278
- ( music stops )
- ( tearfully ) I'LL JUST
STAY HERE AND BE QUIET.

14:48.580 --> 14:50.389
OKAY, WHERE WERE WE?

14:50.490 --> 14:51.946
- INTEGERS--
- DAVID?

14:52.050 --> 14:53.517
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU
WERE GONNA BE QUIET.

14:53.620 --> 14:57.056
- I THINK SOMETHING'S
BURNING.
- FUCK!

14:57.160 --> 14:59.458
ALL RIGHT,
IT WAS WRONG OF ME
TO SAY THAT.

14:59.560 --> 15:01.699
- WE DON'T USE
LANGUAGE LIKE_ THAT.
- ( phone ringing )

15:01.800 --> 15:04.519
- CAN I GET THAT?
- OF COURSE, DURRELL,
YOU LIVE HERE NOW.

15:04.630 --> 15:08.498
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ASK
IF YOU CAN GET THE PHONE.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.431
HELLO?

15:10.540 --> 15:12.974
OH, HEY.

15:13.710 --> 15:15.837
IT'S YOUR LOVER.

15:15.940 --> 15:18.340
- Anthony:
DO I HAVE A LOVER?
- ( snickers )

15:18.450 --> 15:20.577
FROM NOW ON
YOU CAN JUST SAY
IT'S KEITH.

15:20.680 --> 15:23.046
- YES, MASTER.
- DURRELL, I TOLD YOU
I DON'T LIKE THAT JOKE.

15:23.150 --> 15:26.039
- Durrell: Give me my discman!
- Anthony: Ouch!
You're hurting me!

15:26.150 --> 15:30.189
BOTH OF YOU,
OUT OF HERE, NOW!
JUST GET OUT OF THIS RM!

15:30.290 --> 15:31.882
- Anthony: YOU BOY!
- YOU HALF A MAN.

15:31.990 --> 15:33.799
- ( fighting continues )
- David: Hello?

15:33.900 --> 15:36.255
HEY, I'M NOT GONNA
MAKE IT FOR DINNER.

15:36.360 --> 15:38.021
UH, SISSY AND THE KIDS
ARE IN TOWN.

15:38.130 --> 15:39.791
I'VE GOT TO TAKE THEM
TO GEOFFREY'S IN MALIBU.

15:39.900 --> 15:43.336
- WELL, LAH-DI-DAH!
- What's that supposed
to mean?

15:43.440 --> 15:46.898
YOU KNOW WHAT? NOTHING.
I'M JUST IN THE MIDDLE
OF FIVE THINGS HERE.

15:47.010 --> 15:50.969
YOU HAVE FUN
AND I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

15:54.880 --> 15:57.678
Anthony:
OW! I HATE YOU,
YOU PIG.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.088
EW! YOU SMELL LIKE
COW MANURE.

16:04.460 --> 16:08.954
- Durrell: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I WAS JUST CLEANING
THINGS UP.

16:09.060 --> 16:11.563
YOU WERE READING
MY PRIVATE STUFF.

16:11.670 --> 16:16.266
I THOUGHT WE HAD RULES
ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S
PRIVATE STUFF!

16:20.580 --> 16:22.673
Woman on radio:
She suffered from of
self-esteem issues, Dr. Benett?

16:22.780 --> 16:25.647
Benett:
Yes, a lot of those stem
from her childhood traumas.

16:25.750 --> 16:28.446
But some stem
from the size of her nose
and her weak chin.

16:28.550 --> 16:31.018
_ Those are the ones
I can do something about.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.917
Are you pleased
with the results?

16:33.020 --> 16:35.181
I am, but Mary's going
to be the real judge

16:35.290 --> 16:37.349
when she looks into the mirror
for first time tonight.

16:42.860 --> 16:45.169
( typing )

16:47.540 --> 16:51.738
OH, YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
WHAT TIME I NEED TO GET OFF
WORK TOMORROW.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.979
JUST COME HOME
WHENEVER YOU WANT.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.775
NO, I MEAN DID YOU HEAR

16:55.880 --> 16:59.907
WHAT TIME WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO GO IN FOR THE, UH,
THE AMNIO.

17:06.250 --> 17:09.083
WELL, MELNICK SEEMED
TO THINK IT WAS.

17:09.190 --> 17:11.249
SHE ACTED LIKE WE
HAD TO HAVE IT.

17:11.360 --> 17:14.898
( sighs )
NO NO, SHE SAID THE RESULTS
WERE VERY INCONCLUSIVE.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.060
I THINK WE SHOULD
JUST MOVE ON AND TRY NOT
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

17:20.070 --> 17:21.799
BUT I THOUGHT WE DECIDED
THAT WE WERE GONNA--

17:21.900 --> 17:24.039
NO, I DIDN'T
DECIDE ANYTHING.

17:24.140 --> 17:26.165
I DON'T WANT AN AMNIO.

17:26.270 --> 17:29.433
YOU KNOW, THEY CAN
CAUSE MISCARRIAGE.

17:29.540 --> 17:34.113
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
- WELL, WE WAIT FOR LATER--
ULTRASOUND,

17:34.220 --> 17:35.517
AND THEN WE GET
MORE INFORMATION.

17:35.620 --> 17:37.986
BUT IF THERE'S A PROBLEM
WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT IT NOW.

17:38.090 --> 17:39.409
WHY?

17:40.960 --> 17:44.919
- SO THAT WE CAN
TAKE CARE OF IT.
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

17:45.030 --> 17:47.749
- YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
- I DON'T WANT TO GET RID
OF THIS BABY.

17:47.860 --> 17:49.555
AND I'M NOT GOING TO
NO MATTER WHAT.

17:49.660 --> 17:52.458
IF WE FIND OUT
THERE'S A PROBLEM,
WE'LL DEAL WITH THAT THEN.

17:52.570 --> 17:56.392
- OKAY, IF THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL.
- YEAH, THAT'S HOW I FEEL.

18:00.140 --> 18:02.404
IS IT HOW YOU FEEL?

18:04.180 --> 18:06.239
I DON'T KNOW.

18:18.130 --> 18:19.779
Keith:
SO WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

18:19.890 --> 18:23.860
DURRELL'S IN SOME ASSEMBLY
AND HE DIDN'T INVITE US.
SO WHAT?

18:23.970 --> 18:26.165
SO WE'RE HIS PARENTS,
KEITH.

18:26.270 --> 18:29.194
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GO SEE HIM
IN SCHOOL THINGS.

18:29.300 --> 18:32.235
WHAT DID HE SAY
WHEN YOU ASKED HIM
WHY HE DIDN'T INVITE US?

18:32.340 --> 18:36.174
UH, HE JUST MUMBLED
SOMETHING ABOUT KILLING US

18:36.280 --> 18:37.508
IF WE TRIED TO GO TO IT.

18:37.610 --> 18:39.271
WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD
LISTEN TO HIM AND NOT GO.

18:42.020 --> 18:44.147
( sighs )
I COULDN'T SLEEP ALL NIGHT

18:44.250 --> 18:46.309
THINKING ABOUT HAVING
ALL THIS PORN IN THE HOUSE.

18:49.160 --> 18:51.185
- SHIT!
- ( laughing )

18:51.290 --> 18:53.895
JUST HELP ME,
YOU ASSHOLE.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.560
( laughs )
OKAY.

18:56.660 --> 19:00.266
WHAT'S HIS REASON
FOR NOT WANTING US
TO GO TO THE ASSEMBLY?

19:00.370 --> 19:02.190
THIS ONE WE'RE KEEPING.

19:04.170 --> 19:07.833
DO YOU THINK
IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE GAY
AND HE'S ASHAMED OF US?

19:07.940 --> 19:11.148
HE'S NOT THE ONE
THAT'S ASHAM ED ABOUT
US BEING GAY.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.571
THIS IS NOT
ABOUT BEING GAY,
IT'S ABOUT PORN.

19:13.680 --> 19:15.511
IT'S PROBABLY
SOMETHING AS SIMPLE

19:15.620 --> 19:17.884
AS HE DOESN'T WANT US THERE
TO SEE HIM FORGET HIS LINES

19:17.990 --> 19:21.118
AND GET THAT DUMBASS LOOK
THAT KIDS GET ON THEIR FACE
IN THOSE THINGS.

19:21.220 --> 19:22.881
MAYBE.

19:22.990 --> 19:26.619
WE BETTER GET GOING.
WE'VE GOT ANOTHER HUGE BAG
IN THE BACK.

19:39.610 --> 19:41.475
FEDERICO...

19:41.580 --> 19:44.174
CAN YOU TELL ME
IF THIS MAYONNAISE
HAS GONE BAD?

19:44.280 --> 19:46.373
ALL MAYONNAISE
SMELLS BAD TO ME.

19:52.150 --> 19:53.458
( chuckles )

19:54.460 --> 19:57.224
MAKING YOUR
POTATO SALAD, HUH?

19:57.330 --> 19:59.127
WHAT'S
THE BIG OCCASION?

19:59.230 --> 20:00.959
I'M GOING
TO A PARTY TONIGHT--

20:01.060 --> 20:02.948
AT VICTORIA ADAMS'S HOUSE.

20:03.060 --> 20:07.633
- SHE WAS IN "MORE FOR ME."
- OH YEAH, I SAW THAT SHOW
ONCE OR TWICE.

20:07.740 --> 20:11.733
- IT SEEMED SORT OF STUPID.
- SHE'S A FRIEND OF MINE.

20:11.840 --> 20:13.307
OH, I'M SORRY.

20:16.140 --> 20:20.440
SO, UH, HOW ARE THINGS
WITH YOU NOW?

20:20.550 --> 20:23.986
NOW THAT YOU'RE,
YOU KNOW, SINGLE?

20:24.850 --> 20:26.841
THEY'RE WONDERFUL.

20:26.950 --> 20:30.113
I'VE BEEN
TO A LOT OF INTERESTING
CULTURAL EVENTS LATELY.

20:30.220 --> 20:32.620
IN FACT,
IF YOU WANT TO,

20:32.730 --> 20:35.995
YOU COULD COME
TO A JAY MCINERNEY READING
WITH ME TOMORROW.

20:36.100 --> 20:38.967
OH... I'LL TAKE A PASS.

20:39.070 --> 20:41.959
I'VE GOT BE WITH VANESSA
AND THE KIDS.

20:42.070 --> 20:43.367
I UNDERSTAND.

20:48.380 --> 20:50.007
DO YOU THINK
THIS HAS TOO MUCH DILL?

20:52.750 --> 20:56.277
YOU MUST BE VERY HAPPY
NOW THAT YOU'RE BACK
WITH VAN ESSA.

20:56.380 --> 20:58.689
VANESSA'S
A VERY FORGIVING WOMAN.

20:58.790 --> 21:01.452
ACTUALLY, SHE ISN'T.

21:01.560 --> 21:03.721
SHE NEVER WANTS
TO SLEEP WITH ME.

21:03.830 --> 21:06.583
NO MATTER WHAT I DO OR SAY
I CAN'T GET HER TO LOOK AT ME

21:06.690 --> 21:08.851
WITH THAT SAME HUNGER
SHE USED TO HAVE.

21:08.960 --> 21:10.496
IT'S SO PAIN FUL.

21:10.600 --> 21:13.160
THE MOST HORRIBLE PART
IS WHEN I LOOK AT HER,

21:13.270 --> 21:15.363
I STILL
GET SO FUCKING HARD.

21:15.470 --> 21:18.803
YOU KNOW, MASTURBATING CAN
RELIEVE SOME OF THE TENSION.

21:18.910 --> 21:21.435
THERE WERE LONG PERIODS
IN MY MARRIAGE TO NATHANIEL

21:21.540 --> 21:23.349
WHEN HE WAS CONSTANTLY
MASTURBATING.

21:23.450 --> 21:25.077
I WANT PASSION!

21:25.180 --> 21:28.274
I WANT MY WIFE
TO WANT ME SO BAD THAT
EVERY TIME I WALK BY

21:28.380 --> 21:30.541
SHE WANTS TO SQUEEZE
MY ASS AND GRAB MY--

21:30.650 --> 21:31.878
FEDERICO?

21:33.920 --> 21:35.319
UH, YEAH.

21:35.420 --> 21:37.285
TOO MUCH DILL.

21:39.330 --> 21:41.150
HMM...

21:41.260 --> 21:44.593
Marianne:
SO FINALLY I SAY TO
THESE GUYS AT THE NEXT TABLE,

21:44.700 --> 21:47.863
"LOOK, HERE'S THE LINE
AND HERE'S YOU."

21:47.970 --> 21:49.460
( laughs )

21:49.570 --> 21:50.537
HEY!

21:50.640 --> 21:52.437
- OH, HEY, TED.
- HEY.

21:52.540 --> 21:55.805
OH, MARIANNE, YOU THINK
I CAN GET THOSE ASBESTOS
DOCUMENTS LATER TODAY?

21:55.910 --> 21:59.448
- OH, YEAH, SURE.
IS 5:00 OKAY?
- YEAH, BABY.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.412
THAT'S GREAT.
WHAT IS THAT?

22:06.520 --> 22:08.112
OH, IT'S NOTHING.

22:08.220 --> 22:11.519
- I'M TED, BY THE WAY.
WE HAVEN'T MET.
- CLAIRE.

22:11.630 --> 22:14.190
YEAH, TED'S THE LOWEST-PAID
LAWYER IN THE OFFICE,

22:14.300 --> 22:16.860
SO YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SUCK UP TO HIM
AS MUCH AS THE REST.

22:16.960 --> 22:20.635
YOU GUYS LOOKED LIKE
YOU WERE HAVING FUN
LAST NIGHT.

22:20.740 --> 22:24.198
MARIANNE, WERE THOSE GUYS
AT THE NEXT TABLE TRYING
TO PICK YOU UP?

22:24.310 --> 22:25.538
Marianne:
YEAH, BABY.
( giggles )

22:25.640 --> 22:27.471
ARE YOU GONNA
GO TONIGHT?

22:27.580 --> 22:29.536
I'M GONNA TRY
AND MAKE IT.

22:29.640 --> 22:30.948
LATER!

22:31.050 --> 22:32.540
- MM.
- BYE, TED.

22:32.650 --> 22:34.345
LATER.

22:53.770 --> 22:55.635
( dialing )

22:59.940 --> 23:01.202
( sighs )

23:01.310 --> 23:03.198
OH, HEY.
IT'S ME.

23:03.310 --> 23:05.005
DO YOU WANT
TO HAVE LUNCH?

23:06.450 --> 23:08.475
( new age music
Playing )

23:38.450 --> 23:41.817
OH, I'M SO SORRY I'M LATE,
DARLING.

23:41.920 --> 23:46.118
- BUT I WAS JUST IN THE MIDDLE
OF ALL THIS PAPERWORK.
- YEAH, SO I SEE.

23:47.920 --> 23:50.309
OKAY OKAY.

23:50.420 --> 23:51.853
CAT'S OUT OF THE BAG.

23:51.960 --> 23:53.951
( chuckles )
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIM?

23:54.060 --> 23:56.028
- DID YOU SEE HIS ASS?
- NO, I DIDN'T.

23:56.130 --> 23:59.622
- WHO IS THIS PERSON?
- OH, HE'S THIS BRILLIANT
THERAPIST

23:59.730 --> 24:01.334
WHO STUDIED
WITH GARETH FEINBERG.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.364
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK YOU MET HIM ONCE
A LONG TIME AGO.

24:04.470 --> 24:06.802
- OH.
- ANYWAYS, SO WE RAN
INTO EACH OTHER

24:06.910 --> 24:08.537
AT A PARTY
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.

24:08.640 --> 24:10.471
AND, YOU KNOW,
ONE THING LED TO THE OTHER.

24:10.580 --> 24:13.140
- YOU KNOW HOW THAT IS.
- NO, NOT REALLY.

24:13.250 --> 24:15.616
COME ON,
DON'T JUDGE ME, DEAR.

24:15.720 --> 24:18.587
GOD, I WONDER IF
ANYBODY ELSE SAW US.

24:18.690 --> 24:21.181
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
DON'T YOU AND OLIVIER
HAVE RULES

24:21.290 --> 24:22.587
LIKE YOU AND DAD DID?

24:22.690 --> 24:26.182
OH, IF ONLY OLIVIER WERE
THAT EMOTIONALLY MATURE.

24:26.290 --> 24:29.851
NO, HE HAS SOME
VERY ANTIQUATED IDEAS
ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS.

24:29.960 --> 24:33.691
YEAH, WELL,
PEOPLE ARE STRANGE.

24:33.800 --> 24:38.737
DARLING, LET'S TRY AND HAVE
SOME NICE GIRL TIME,
SHALL WE?

24:38.840 --> 24:40.899
ISN'T THAT WHY YOU CALLED?

24:42.480 --> 24:44.903
YEAH, I GUESS SO.

24:45.010 --> 24:48.639
SO, I'VE BEEN THINKING
THIS BABY IS GOING TO WREAK
HAVOC ON YOUR BODY.

24:48.750 --> 24:51.787
LET ME GIVE YOU
THE NUMBER OF THIS BRILLIANT
GYROTONIC TRAINER

24:51.890 --> 24:55.087
- WHO WILL JUS
CHANGE YOUR LIFE.
- HMM.

24:55.190 --> 24:56.680
I CAN'T WAIT.

24:56.790 --> 24:59.281
SO THAT'S THE END
OF THE WALK-THROUGH.

24:59.390 --> 25:02.996
DON'T WORRY ABOUT TOMORROW.
WE WILL TAKE CARE
OF EVERYTHING.

25:03.100 --> 25:05.318
UH, ONE MORE THING--

25:05.430 --> 25:09.139
THERE ISN'T GOING
TO BE ANOTHER FUNERAL
IN THE OTHER ROOM?

25:09.240 --> 25:10.559
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

25:10.670 --> 25:12.467
I CAN ASSURE YOU
YOU WON'T HEAR ANYTHING

25:12.570 --> 25:14.834
DURING YOUR SILENT
CENTERING TIME.

25:14.940 --> 25:17.329
EXCEPT A FEW
GRUMBLING TUMMIES,
I SUPPOSE.

25:17.440 --> 25:19.499
( laughs )

25:20.820 --> 25:23.277
OH, MRS. BURNS,
IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND
SIGNING

25:23.380 --> 25:25.211
SOME OF THOSE FORMS
I TOLD YOU ABOUT...

25:25.320 --> 25:26.947
OF COURSE.

25:32.960 --> 25:35.190
- "SILENT CENTERING TIME"?
- ( chuckles )

25:35.300 --> 25:37.450
SILENT WORSHIP.

25:37.570 --> 25:40.528
WE BELIEVE THAT GOD IS
WITHIN ALL OF US.

25:40.640 --> 25:43.393
IF WE GET TOGETHER
AND ARE SILENT

25:43.500 --> 25:46.003
HOPEFULLY WE EACH HEAR
SOMETHING FROM GOD.

25:46.810 --> 25:49.370
WHAT IF YOU DON'T?

25:49.480 --> 25:51.368
YOU MAKE SOMETHING UP.

25:51.480 --> 25:53.619
AT LEAST I DO.

25:55.250 --> 25:56.774
HOW DO YOU--

25:56.880 --> 26:00.316
HOW DO YOU KNOW
GOD'S NOT TELLING YOU
WHAT TO MAKE UP?

26:02.860 --> 26:06.956
NATE,
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

26:07.060 --> 26:09.358
George:
ARE YOU SURE YOU
DON'T WANT ANYTHING?

26:09.460 --> 26:11.519
I HAD AN ENORMOUS
SANDWICH FOR LUNCH.

26:11.630 --> 26:13.837
OH, OKAY.

26:16.770 --> 26:18.465
YOU DIDN'T
HAPPEN TO READ

26:18.570 --> 26:22.006
PAUL KRUGMAN'S EDITORIAL
THIS MORNING, DID YOU?

26:22.110 --> 26:24.874
HE HAD THIS RVELOUS
TAKE ON BUSH--

26:24.980 --> 26:28.609
GEORGE, WHY DID YOU
WANT TO SEE ME?

26:30.080 --> 26:31.286
( clears throat )

26:31.390 --> 26:34.518
THIS, UH,
PERIOD OF BEING ALONE

26:34.620 --> 26:37.487
HAS BEEN VERY DIFFICULT
FOR ME, RUTH.

26:37.590 --> 26:39.751
WELL, I'VE BEEN DOING
A LOT OF THINKING--

26:39.860 --> 26:42.328
I'M NOT GETTING BACK
TOGETHER WITH YOU.

26:42.430 --> 26:43.966
I KNOW THAT.

26:44.070 --> 26:46.959
I JUST WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT GETTING A DIVORCE.

26:47.070 --> 26:48.662
OH.

26:48.770 --> 26:52.001
WELL, OF COURSE
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TOO.

26:53.410 --> 26:56.208
APPARENTLY, WE JUST HAVE
TO LIVE FOR SIX MONTHS

26:56.310 --> 26:59.279
IN SEPARATE RESIDENCES,
THEN FILE SOME PAPERS.

27:00.150 --> 27:01.811
UM...

27:01.920 --> 27:04.309
I THINK WE SHOULD GET
A QUICKER DIVORCE.

27:04.420 --> 27:06.183
I'VE BEEN DOING
SOME RESEARCH,

27:06.290 --> 27:09.509
AND IF ONE OF US
FLIES TO, SAY, HAITI
FOR THE WEEKEND

27:09.620 --> 27:12.748
WE CAN TAKE CARE
OF THIS THING A LOT SOONER.

27:12.860 --> 27:15.124
- IS THIS REALLY NECESSARY?
- I THINK IT WILL BE HEALTHIER

27:15.230 --> 27:19.018
FOR OUR PSYCHES
IF WE JUST, YOU KNOW,
MOVE ON.

27:19.130 --> 27:23.339
YOU WANT TO FLY TO HAITI
FOR A QUICKIE DIVORCE
JUST FOR OUR PSYCHES?

27:28.440 --> 27:30.499
RUTH...

27:30.610 --> 27:32.908
I'M ENGAGED.

27:34.580 --> 27:37.276
HER NAME IS
JOY SOLOMON.

27:37.380 --> 27:40.918
I MET HER AT A TEA
AT DEAN KEKALOS'S HOUSE.

27:41.020 --> 27:46.378
SHE'S A WOMEN'S STUDIES
PROFESSOR, VISITING
THIS SEMESTER.

27:46.490 --> 27:48.629
WE WERE BOTH
RAISED IN MISSOURI.

27:48.730 --> 27:52.325
I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE
EXPECTED THIS.

27:52.430 --> 27:55.433
BOY, I AM SOME FOOL
ALL RIGHT.

27:55.540 --> 27:59.101
LISTEN, I KNOW
HOW THIS MUST SOUND
TO YOU, BUT...

28:00.570 --> 28:03.778
I'M IN LOVE.

28:05.950 --> 28:07.918
I THINK I SHOULD GO.

28:09.020 --> 28:11.147
DO YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS?

28:11.250 --> 28:15.084
STRANGELY ENOUGH,
I DON'T THINK I HAVE ANY.

28:18.660 --> 28:20.423
GOODBYE, GEORGE.

28:25.600 --> 28:27.090
FIRST OFF,
THE CHANCES ARE

28:27.200 --> 28:30.033
THAT EVERYTHING'S GOING
TO BE OKAY WITH THIS BABY.

28:31.870 --> 28:34.236
BUT EVEN IF IT'S NOT...

28:34.340 --> 28:36.831
IT COULD STILL BE OKAY.

28:38.210 --> 28:40.849
HOW CAN YOU
OF ALL PEOPLE SAY THAT?

28:45.190 --> 28:48.387
WHEN THE DOCTORS
FIRST TOLD ME THAT
JESSE WAS SICK...

28:49.720 --> 28:52.086
I WAS SO SCARED.

28:53.590 --> 28:55.899
WE HAD TO GIVE HIM
ALL THESE SHOTS

28:56.000 --> 28:57.797
THAT MADE HIM SCREAM.

28:57.900 --> 29:01.768
AND THEN THERE WERE
ALL THE USELESS OPERATIONS.

29:02.840 --> 29:04.535
BUT, NATE...

29:09.980 --> 29:14.178
( chuckles )
THE FIRST TIME
THAT JESSE LAUGHED?

29:16.320 --> 29:18.686
HE USED TO...

29:18.790 --> 29:21.782
HE USED TO GET SO EXCITED
TO LOOK AT THE MOON.

29:23.560 --> 29:24.652
HE WAS ONLY TWO,

29:24.760 --> 29:28.628
BUT HE WAS A PERSON.

29:28.730 --> 29:31.767
AN AMAZING PERSON.

29:33.730 --> 29:36.836
AND HE WAS HERE
SUCH A SHORT TIME,

29:36.940 --> 29:39.659
I FEEL JUST
INCREDIBLY LUCKY

29:39.770 --> 29:42.330
THAT I GOT TO KNOW HIM.

29:42.440 --> 29:45.841
IT MADE ME
A BIGGER PERSON.

29:45.950 --> 29:49.545
AND THAT'S SOMETHING
ALL CHILDREN DO.

29:54.860 --> 29:57.829
YOU GUYS DON'T WANT
YOUR PARENTS GOING TO
SCHOOL THINGS, RIGHT?

29:57.930 --> 30:00.080
NOT REALLY.
MOM ALWAYS TRIES TO GET

30:00.190 --> 30:02.192
THE TEACHERS TO VALIDATE
HER PARENTING.

30:02.300 --> 30:05.792
AND DAD ALWAYS
SLOBBERS OVER MR. JANETTI,
THE GUY WHO TEACHES SHOP.

30:05.900 --> 30:07.561
I KNEW I WAS RIGHT.

30:07.670 --> 30:10.730
DAVID THINKS THAT WE SHOULD
GO TO DURRELL'S ASSEMBLY
AGAINST HIS WILL.

30:10.840 --> 30:12.660
- BUT YOU AGREE WITH ME?
- ABSOLUTELY.

30:12.770 --> 30:15.568
IT SOUNDS LIKE
DURRELL IS TRYING TO ASSERT
HIS INDIVIDUAL IDENTITY.

30:15.680 --> 30:17.238
AT LEAST FOR NOW.

30:17.340 --> 30:20.798
GRADUALLY
HE'LL COME TO HAVE
SOME FAMILIAL IDENTITY.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.672
THE IMPORTANT THING IS
NOT TO FORCE IT.

30:22.780 --> 30:24.247
LET HIM INITIATE
AT HIS OWN PACE.

30:24.350 --> 30:26.545
I'VE GOT WRITE
THESE THINGS DOWN FOR DAVID.

30:26.650 --> 30:28.413
OH, DON'T WORRY.
I'LL DO IT.

30:28.520 --> 30:32.286
OH, UM... THANKS.

30:32.390 --> 30:35.097
Marianne:
ALL RIGHT, KIRSTEN,
MEET ME AT THE ELEVATOR.

30:35.200 --> 30:37.657
- FIRST, I HAVE TO GO POTTY.
- Kirsten: YEAH, BABY.

30:37.760 --> 30:39.125
Marianne:
HEY, JOHNNY, YOU COMING?

30:39.230 --> 30:41.437
YEAH, BABY.
BUT I'LL MEET YOU THERE.

30:44.170 --> 30:47.003
- UH, JOHNNY?
- HEY, HAVE A GOOD NIGHT,
CLAIRE.

30:47.110 --> 30:50.830
OH, I WAS WONDERING,
ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO DOC'S?

30:52.780 --> 30:54.509
( jazz music playing )

31:02.820 --> 31:05.084
Victoria:
RUTH!

31:08.000 --> 31:10.753
I'M SO GLAD
YOU COULD MAKE IT.

31:10.860 --> 31:13.465
I REALLY WANT YOU TO MEET
MY FRIEND MITCHELL.

31:13.570 --> 31:15.367
AND WHAT IS THIS?

31:15.470 --> 31:18.769
- IT'S NOTHING. I JUST--
- YOUR FAMOUS POTATO SALAD.

31:18.870 --> 31:20.269
NOW I REMEMBER.

31:20.370 --> 31:24.170
I TOLD YOU
NOT TO BRING ANYTHING,
YOU DEVIL.

31:24.280 --> 31:25.372
HERE.

31:25.480 --> 31:29.519
LET'S JUST PUT IT HERE
WITH EVERYTHING ELSE.

31:29.620 --> 31:31.679
- IT'S TOO BIG.
- NONSENSE.

31:31.790 --> 31:33.644
LET'S JUST PUSH
THIS STUFF ASIDE.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.116
THERE.

31:36.220 --> 31:38.120
PERFECT.

31:39.630 --> 31:41.495
NOW START MINGLING.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.090
NO ONE'S GONNA BITE YOU.

31:43.200 --> 31:46.294
WELL, MAYBE IF YOU'RE LUCKY
SOMEONE WILL.

31:55.780 --> 31:59.079
- ( "Any Way
You Want It" playing )
- ( cheering )

31:59.180 --> 32:02.616
YOU KNOW, I'M REALLY NOT
DRAWN TO MECHANICAL ANIMALS.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.278
ME NEITHER.

32:04.390 --> 32:07.188
I'M ACTUALLY NOT REALLY
DRAWN TO LIVE ANIMALS.

32:08.860 --> 32:11.420
SO ARE YOU
SEEING ANYONE?

32:11.530 --> 32:15.398
OH, I WAS LIVING
WITH THIS GUY
FOR A WHILE.

32:15.500 --> 32:17.889
WHAT HAPPENED?

32:18.000 --> 32:19.763
UH, WE BROKE UP.

32:19.870 --> 32:22.031
AND NOW I HEAR
HE'S LEFT TOWN.

32:22.140 --> 32:24.506
PROBABLY TO GO
TO SOME OVERPRICED
LOONY BIN.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.601
HE'S KIND OF A NUTJOB.

32:29.840 --> 32:31.979
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I JUST SAID THAT.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.809
HE'S A GREAT GUY.

32:33.910 --> 32:37.038
HE'S REALLY UNIQUE.

32:37.150 --> 32:38.686
AND THE WHOLE THING
WAS JUST--

32:38.790 --> 32:41.816
I DON'T THINK
I WAS READY FOR
SOMETHING REAL,

32:41.920 --> 32:43.251
LIKE SOMETHING
WITH CHALLENGES.

32:43.360 --> 32:45.055
AND HE WAS
IN A DIFFERENT PLACE
THAN ME.

32:45.160 --> 32:48.220
- HE'S A LITTLE OLDER.
- I'M SEEING AN OLDER GUY.

32:48.330 --> 32:50.798
ACTUALLY, HE'S JUST
A YEAR AND HALF OLDER.

32:50.900 --> 32:53.528
REALLY?
WHAT'S HE DO?

32:53.630 --> 32:55.359
LAWYER.

32:56.570 --> 32:57.867
YEAH.

32:57.970 --> 33:00.131
FROM THE OFFICE.

33:00.240 --> 33:01.571
WE'RE TRYING
TO KEEP IT QUIET.

33:01.680 --> 33:04.171
OH MY GOD.
WHO IS HE?

33:06.550 --> 33:09.144
WHAT? TED?

33:09.250 --> 33:11.013
OH.

33:11.120 --> 33:13.987
I'VE NEVER SEEN
YOU TWO TOGETHER.

33:14.090 --> 33:15.910
OH, WELL, WE'RE TRYING
TO BE COOL ABOUT IT.

33:16.020 --> 33:17.658
I MEAN IT'S STILL
SORT OF NEW.

33:17.760 --> 33:21.196
SEE WE HOOKED UP AT
HONG FU'S BIRTHDAY PARTY
IN NOVEMBER,

33:21.300 --> 33:23.291
THEN WE DIDN'T TALK
FOR LIKE A MONTH.

33:23.400 --> 33:25.459
THEN WE WERE BOTH HERE
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO

33:25.570 --> 33:28.664
AND ENDED UP FOOLING AROUND
IN THE GUYS' BATHROOM.

33:28.770 --> 33:30.761
IT'S REALLY RANK IN THERE.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.898
SO NOW YOU'RE DATING?

33:34.010 --> 33:36.001
I THINK
WE WILL BE SOON.

33:36.110 --> 33:38.499
WE JUST NEED TO TAKE IT
TO THAT NEXT PLACE

33:38.610 --> 33:41.477
AS SOON
AS HE DEALS WITH SOME
OF HIS INTIMACY ISSUES.

33:41.580 --> 33:43.468
SURE.

33:43.580 --> 33:45.480
I GET IT.

33:46.590 --> 33:48.455
I REALLY SHOULD WATCH
MORE SITCOMS.

33:48.560 --> 33:51.358
I KEEP MEANING TO,
BUT I NEVER KNOW
WHEN THEY'RE ON.

33:51.460 --> 33:56.488
I JUST DID A SPOT ON THE NEW
JENNIFER LOVE HEWITT SHOW.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.693
SWEET GIRL.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.706
WELL, UH, MITCHELL...

34:07.510 --> 34:08.704
YEAH.

34:17.450 --> 34:19.281
RUTH!

34:19.390 --> 34:22.655
YOU LOOK SO FORLORN
STANDING HERE ALL ALONE.

34:22.760 --> 34:27.982
LET'S CIRCLE AND SEE
IF WE CAN FIND SOME NICE
QUIRKY GUY FOR YOU.

34:28.100 --> 34:30.421
THANKS, CINDY.
BUT I DON'T THINK SO.

34:30.530 --> 34:33.328
- OH, COME ON, RUTH.
IT'LL BE FUN.
- NO, IT WON'T BE FUN.

34:33.430 --> 34:35.489
I AM SEVEN MILLION
YEARS OLD.

34:35.600 --> 34:37.989
AND I HAVE THIS EMPTINESS
THAT WON'T GO AWAY.

34:38.110 --> 34:40.408
I'VE GONE EVERYWHERE
AND I'VE DONE EVERYTHING.

34:40.510 --> 34:42.876
I EVEN WENT TO THE STUPID
SKIRBALL CENTER.

34:42.980 --> 34:44.709
AND I AM STILL ALL ALONE.

34:44.810 --> 34:47.244
EVERYONE ELSE GETS TO FIND
SOMEONE JUST LIKE THAT.
( snaps )

34:47.350 --> 34:48.942
SO I'M DONE.
THAT'S IT!

34:49.050 --> 34:52.508
I JUST WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE
SO I CAN SHRIVEL UP
IN PEACE. PLEASE!

34:52.620 --> 34:55.282
OKAY.

35:24.790 --> 35:26.610
THAN KS.

35:30.190 --> 35:32.454
Kirsten:
YEAH, BABY!

35:32.560 --> 35:34.892
- Marianne: YEAH, BABY!
- Johnny: YEAH, BABY!

35:35.000 --> 35:37.389
- Ted: CLAIRE!
- OH, HEY.

35:37.500 --> 35:39.764
I'VE BEEN DOING
SOME RESEARCH ON YOU.

35:39.870 --> 35:43.237
- OH, REALLY?
- YEAH, I HEARD YOU'RE,
LIKE, THIS AMAZING ARTIST,

35:43.340 --> 35:46.207
HAD A SHOW AND EVERYTHING.
THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

35:46.310 --> 35:49.302
OH, I THINK YOU HAVE ME
CONFUSED WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

35:49.410 --> 35:53.005
REALLY?
I DON'T THINK SO.

35:53.110 --> 35:55.908
( chuckles )

35:56.020 --> 36:01.549
SO WHAT ARE YOU, LIKE,
SOME GUY WHO ALWAYS KNEW
HE WANTED TO BE A LAWYER?

36:01.660 --> 36:04.356
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
IT WAS JUST THE EASIEST
PATH FOR ME.

36:04.460 --> 36:06.553
I LIKE BEING A LAWYER.

36:06.660 --> 36:09.424
IT'S JUST ONE PART
OF MY LIFE THOUGH.

36:11.060 --> 36:13.369
SOUNDS INTERESTING.

36:14.840 --> 36:16.239
IF YOU'RE REALLY INTERESTED,

36:16.340 --> 36:17.989
MAYBE SOME TIME I COULD
SHOW YOU THE OTHER PARTS.

36:18.100 --> 36:20.637
( chuckles )

36:21.710 --> 36:24.133
I SHOULD BE GETTING BACK
TO THE TABLE.

36:24.250 --> 36:26.400
DO YOU WANT TO JOIN US?

36:28.580 --> 36:29.945
UH...

36:30.050 --> 36:33.349
I SHOULD GET BACK
TO MY FRIENDS.

36:35.460 --> 36:37.416
I DON'T CARE
WHAT THOSE TWO FREAKS
OF NATURE SAID.

36:37.520 --> 36:40.182
I AM GOING
TO THIS ASSEMBLY TOMORROW,
AND THAT'S THAT.

36:40.290 --> 36:43.350
- WHY?
- BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT.

36:43.460 --> 36:45.462
KIDS SHOULD LOOK OUT
INTO THE AUDIENCE

36:45.570 --> 36:47.765
AND HAVE SOMEONE
ROOTING FOR THEM.

36:47.870 --> 36:51.089
YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS
IN SEVENTH GRADE I WAS
A SAILOR IN "ANYTHING GOES."

36:51.200 --> 36:53.600
I KNOW.
YOU BRING IT UP
ONCE A WEEK.

36:53.710 --> 36:57.976
( sighs )
WELL, MY MOTHER CAME
BUT MY FATHER DIDN'T.

36:58.080 --> 37:00.207
- WHY NOT?
- PLANE CRASH.

37:00.310 --> 37:02.540
HE HAD TO DEAL
WITH A WHOLE FAMILY
THAT DIED.

37:02.650 --> 37:05.346
WE HAD THIS RITUAL
IN MY FAMILY

37:05.450 --> 37:07.645
THAT WHENEVER ONE OF US
WAS IN A THING AT SCHOOL

37:07.750 --> 37:11.481
WE WOULD ALWAYS GO
TO MARIE CALLENDER'S
FOR BOSTON CREAM PIE AFTER.

37:11.590 --> 37:13.820
I HATE
BOSTON CREAM PIE.

37:13.930 --> 37:17.798
( sighs )
ANYWAY, WE WENT WITHOUT HIM
BUT IT WASN'T THE SAME.

37:19.170 --> 37:20.694
I STILL SAY TATE AND ENZO
HAVE A POINT.

37:20.800 --> 37:23.189
- OF COURSE YOU DO.
- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

37:23.300 --> 37:25.131
KEITH, YOU'LL SEIZE
ON ANYTHING

37:25.240 --> 37:26.901
NOT TO BE A PARENT
TO THESE TWO KIDS.

37:27.010 --> 37:29.035
- YOU'RE BARELY HERE.
- I HAVE TO WORK.

37:29.140 --> 37:30.835
WHEN YOU ARE HERE,
YOU HARDLY TALK TO THEM.

37:30.940 --> 37:32.646
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO.
YOU MADE SURE OF THAT.

37:32.750 --> 37:34.615
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU
TO YELL AT THEM.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.915
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU HAVE TO AVOID THEM.

37:37.020 --> 37:39.887
THIS WHOLE THING SUCKS.
I'M DOING THIS ALL ALONE

37:39.990 --> 37:43.414
WITHOUT GETTING ANY CREDIT
FOR BEING A SINGLE PARENT.

37:43.520 --> 37:45.784
FINE.
THEN YOU CAN GO
BY YOURSELF TOMORROW

37:45.890 --> 37:47.653
BECAUSE I THINK
IT'S THE WRONG THING TO DO.

37:47.760 --> 37:50.524
DON'T YOU FEEL ANYTHING
FOR THESE POOR KIDS?

37:50.630 --> 37:53.224
- DON'T YOU HAVE A SOUL?
- OF COURSE I HAVE A SOUL.

37:53.330 --> 37:55.230
THAT'S A TERRIBLE THING
TO SAY ABOUT YOUR PARTNER.

37:55.340 --> 37:59.436
YEAH, WELL,
IT'S A TERRIBLE THING
TO FEEL ABOUT YOUR PARTNER.

38:03.940 --> 38:05.874
( moaning )

38:12.090 --> 38:14.479
( groaning )

38:22.160 --> 38:23.752
( pants )
WHEW.

38:23.860 --> 38:26.465
( chuckles )
WOW.

38:26.570 --> 38:28.367
THAT WAS AMAZING.

38:28.470 --> 38:31.359
THAT'S NICE, SWEETIE.

38:45.920 --> 38:47.547
THAT'S OKAY.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.014
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT.

38:52.260 --> 38:54.455
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

38:54.560 --> 38:58.724
- DON'T YOU WANNA COME?
- NO. I'M GOOD.

39:00.130 --> 39:01.893
OH.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.332
OKAY.

39:12.410 --> 39:14.913
( sighs )

39:15.020 --> 39:20.481
SO NOW MY MOTHER IS FUCKING
THIS GUY ONCE A WEEK AFTER
HIS GESTALT SEMINAR.

39:20.590 --> 39:22.410
DON'T YOU THINK
SHE'S DEPRESSING?

39:22.520 --> 39:24.727
NOT REALLY.

39:24.830 --> 39:27.287
WHAT'S DEPRESSING
IS HER BEING
WITH SOME ASSHOLE

39:27.390 --> 39:29.324
WHO PONTIFICATES
ABOUT ART
ALL THE TIME.

39:29.430 --> 39:32.558
I THINK IT'S GREAT
YOUR MOTHER'S HAVING
A GOOD TIME.

39:32.670 --> 39:34.638
HUH.

39:35.900 --> 39:38.130
WHAT ABOUT PENELOPE?

39:38.240 --> 39:39.468
WHO'S PENELOPE?

39:39.570 --> 39:42.630
A NAME FOR THE BABY
IF IT'S A GIRL.

39:42.740 --> 39:46.744
I DON'T REALLY FEEL LIKE
TALKING ABOUT BABY NAMES
RIGHT NOW.

39:48.420 --> 39:50.980
- WELL, IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANT TQEEALK ABOUT?

39:51.080 --> 39:54.311
I HATE THE NAME PENELOPE.
PENELOPE'S PRETENTIOUS.

39:54.420 --> 39:56.456
"PENELOPE THINKS SHE'S
SO GREAT WHEN SHE'S NOT."

39:56.560 --> 39:58.721
I DON'T EVEN KNOW ANYBODY
WHO'D WANT A PENELOPE.

39:58.830 --> 40:00.923
YOU'RE REALLY MAD
AT ME, AREN'T YOU?

40:01.030 --> 40:02.998
( groans )
OH, SPARE ME.

40:03.100 --> 40:06.467
YOU WANT ME TO GO TO A DOCTOR,
MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S
ALL RIGHT WITH THE BABY.

40:06.570 --> 40:07.696
AND IF IT ISN'T,
YOU WANT ME TO KILL IT?

40:07.800 --> 40:09.267
JESUS, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO PUT IT THAT WAY.

40:09.370 --> 40:11.804
- WELL?
- YES, THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.468
AND I DON'T SEE
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT.

40:13.570 --> 40:16.471
WE CAN TRY AGAIN.

40:17.780 --> 40:19.407
I WAS JUST TALKING
WITH MAGGIE,

40:19.510 --> 40:21.842
AND SHE WAS TELLING ME
HOW DIFFICULT IT IS

40:21.950 --> 40:25.989
AND HOW MANY SACRIFICES
SHE HAD TO MAKE WHEN
HER CHILD WAS SICK.

40:26.090 --> 40:28.479
HOW MANY FINANCIAL PROBLEMS
SHE AND HER HUSBAND
ENDED UP HAVING.

40:28.590 --> 40:31.525
AND JUST HOW
FUCKING HARD IT IS.

40:31.630 --> 40:34.656
DID SHE REGRET
HAVING HIM?

40:34.760 --> 40:36.955
- LOOK, THAT IS NOT
THE POINT.
- WHY NOT?

40:37.060 --> 40:39.767
BECAUSE YOU AND I AREN'T MAGGIE.
SHE'S BETTER THAN WE ARE.

40:39.870 --> 40:41.565
WHAT THE FUCK IS
THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

40:41.670 --> 40:44.559
AND WHAT ABOUT MAYA?
BRINGING A SICK CHILD
INTO THE HOUSE

40:44.670 --> 40:47.400
WOULD BE
VERY DIFFICULT FOR HER.
IT'S NOT FAIR.

40:47.510 --> 40:49.478
I MEAN, DID YOU EVER
THINK OF HER?

40:49.580 --> 40:52.606
I THINK MAYA WOULD LOVE
WHOEVER THIS CHILD IS.

40:52.710 --> 40:56.043
- SHE'S A VERY LOVING PERSON.
- OH, UNLIKE ME?

40:57.420 --> 40:59.217
( sighs )

40:59.320 --> 41:01.811
( door slams )

41:26.410 --> 41:28.469
( sighs )

41:30.250 --> 41:32.684
( sighs )

41:38.460 --> 41:39.927
( sniffs )

41:40.030 --> 41:42.225
( knocks at door)

41:42.330 --> 41:43.854
( door opens )

41:43.960 --> 41:47.396
- Margaret:
BRENDA! YOO-HOO!
- OH, SHIT!

41:47.500 --> 41:49.661
BRENDA, HONEY!

41:50.770 --> 41:53.739
HONEY!
DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME?

41:53.840 --> 41:56.274
OH. GOD, NO.
SORRY.

41:56.380 --> 41:57.836
OH, WELL, DON'T MIND ME.

41:57.940 --> 42:00.943
I'M JUST DROPPING THIS OFF.
IT'S FOR THE BABY.

42:01.050 --> 42:05.680
YOU JUST POPPED IN
UNEXPECTEDLY TO DROP OFF
AN EXPENSIVE GIFT?

42:05.790 --> 42:09.419
UH, WELL,
OLIVIER WAS ASKING
SOME QUESTIONS

42:09.520 --> 42:11.988
ABOUT HOW COME LUNCH
TOOK SO LONG.

42:12.090 --> 42:13.580
I SEE.

42:13.690 --> 42:15.521
OH, I NEED YOU
TO COVER FOR ME, HONEY,

42:15.630 --> 42:19.191
JUST IN CASE HE CALLS YOU
IN ONE OF HIS DRUNKEN RAGES.

42:19.300 --> 42:21.268
MM-HMM.

42:22.670 --> 42:24.194
WELL, WHY DON'T WE
JUST OPEN THIS UP

42:24.300 --> 42:27.133
SO YOU CAN TELL ME WHY
THE BABY WON'T LIKE IT?

42:28.710 --> 42:31.178
- OH.
- HONEY?

42:33.280 --> 42:35.714
( chatting )

42:40.020 --> 42:43.717
I'M REALLY GLAD
YOU DECIDED TO COME.
IT MEANS A LOT TO ME.

42:43.820 --> 42:46.084
YEAH, WELL, I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED TO SEE

42:46.190 --> 42:50.559
THE MUSICAL CELEBRATION
OF, UH, "BIODIVERSITY."

42:50.660 --> 42:52.696
NOW REMEMBER IF YOU SEE
DURRELL LOOK IN OUR DIRECTION

42:52.800 --> 42:55.064
JUST SCRUNCH DOWN.

42:55.170 --> 42:56.137
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

42:56.240 --> 42:58.435
I DIDN'T TELL HIM
WE WERE GOING TO BE HERE.

42:58.540 --> 43:01.873
- WHY NOT?
- BECAUSE I'M SCARED OF HIM.

43:01.980 --> 43:04.801
I THOUGHT THE WHOLE POINT
OF THIS WAS TO GIVE HIM
EMOTIONAL SUPPORT.

43:04.910 --> 43:07.401
WE ARE.
HE JUST DOESN'T KNOW IT.

43:07.510 --> 43:10.115
LET'S KEEP IT THAT WAY.
OOH, IT'S STARTING.

43:10.220 --> 43:11.414
( applause )

43:11.520 --> 43:14.045
( piano playing )

43:17.560 --> 43:23.624
* WE ARE PLANTS,
WE ARE ANIMALS *

43:23.730 --> 43:28.736
* WE ARE PEOPLE
AND WE SHARE THIS PLANET. *

43:28.840 --> 43:31.809
OH, REALLY, DARLING.
I DON'T SEE WHAT
THE BIG DEAL IS.

43:31.910 --> 43:33.901
OH, THANKS, MOM.
THAT MAKES ME FEEL
A LOT BETTER.

43:34.010 --> 43:37.309
OH WELL, ALL COUPLES
HAVE THESE KINDS OF
DISAGREEMENTS.

43:37.410 --> 43:41.676
YOU THINK I DIDN'T WANT
TO ABORT YOU AND BILLY?

43:41.780 --> 43:44.374
BUT YOUR FATHER
TALKED ME OUT OF IT
BOTH TIMES

43:44.480 --> 43:46.380
AND THE REST IS HISTORY.

43:46.490 --> 43:49.755
HONEY, THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING IS THAT
YOU AND NATE ARE A TEAM.

43:49.860 --> 43:54.126
YOU HAVE TO SEE EACH OTHER
AS ALLIES NOT AS ENEMIES.

43:54.230 --> 43:55.754
WELL, HOW DO I DO THAT?

43:55.860 --> 43:58.055
WELL, HONESTLY,
BY LOOKING AT IT
FROM HIS SIDE.

43:58.160 --> 44:01.368
- DO YOU REALLY
THINK HE HAS A POINT?
- ACTUALLY, I DO.

44:01.470 --> 44:04.462
I MEAN,
LIFE IS SO FUCKING HARD
EVEN WHEN IT'S EASY.

44:04.570 --> 44:08.631
SO WHY NOT TRY AND MAKE IT
LESS CHALLENGING IF WE CAN?

44:12.310 --> 44:14.676
I-I UNDERSTAND.

44:14.780 --> 44:17.544
NO, I CAN HOLD.

44:17.650 --> 44:21.711
- ( knocks )
- IS SOMEONE THERE?

44:23.690 --> 44:25.988
HELLO?

44:28.630 --> 44:32.361
- HOW CAN I HELP YOU?
- I'M NOT SURE.

44:32.470 --> 44:35.633
I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO
TO A JAY MCINERNEY
BOOK SIGNING,

44:35.740 --> 44:37.765
BUT I SOME HOW
WHEN I GOT IN THE CAR

44:37.870 --> 44:39.758
I DROVE OVER HERE
AND LOOKED YOU UP
IN THE DIRECTORY.

44:39.870 --> 44:42.430
AND NOW HERE I AM.

44:44.040 --> 44:46.247
I'M RUTH,

44:46.350 --> 44:48.170
GEORGE SIBLEY'S WIFE.

44:48.280 --> 44:51.477
YOU'RE JOY SOLOMON,
HIS FIANCEE, RIGHT?

44:51.580 --> 44:53.480
UM...

44:53.590 --> 44:55.478
NO, I'M STILL HERE.

44:55.590 --> 44:58.081
BUT I THINK I NEED
TO CALL YOU BACK.

45:03.460 --> 45:08.739
* BUT IF I MINE TOO MUCH
IT'LL CAUSE WATER POLLUTION
AND SUCH... *

45:08.840 --> 45:10.796
( applause )

45:15.680 --> 45:20.640
* I AM AN ELM TREE,
DON'T OVERPLANT ME *

45:20.750 --> 45:25.244
* I NEED TO BE SURROUNDED
BY OTHER TREES *

45:25.350 --> 45:31.255
* OR ELSE I'LL DIE
OF DUTCH ELM DISEASE... *

45:38.560 --> 45:40.528
* I AM A CORAL REEF...

45:40.630 --> 45:44.498
David:
* BLOW, GABRIEL, BLOW

45:44.600 --> 45:48.161
* BLOW, GABRIEL, BLOW

45:48.270 --> 45:50.704
* I'VE BEEN A SINNER,
I'VE BEEN A SCAMP *

45:50.810 --> 45:53.540
* BUT NOW I'M WILLING
TO TRIM MY LAMP *

45:53.650 --> 45:55.709
* SO, BLOW, GABRIEL

45:55.820 --> 45:58.380
* BLOW!

45:58.480 --> 46:00.516
( applause, cheering )

46:02.190 --> 46:05.079
- ( whispers ) DAVID.
- OH, SORRY.

46:05.190 --> 46:07.988
WHY DID YOU EVEN HAVE
A BOMB SHELTER?

46:08.090 --> 46:11.491
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
THE POINT IS HE BARRICADED
HIMSELF DOWN THERE

46:11.600 --> 46:13.363
LOOKING LIKE SOME KIND
OF MOUNTAIN MAN.

46:13.470 --> 46:16.268
WHEN THEY FINALLY
PULLED HIM OUT AND PUT HIM
IN THE MENTAL HOSPITAL,

46:16.370 --> 46:18.930
WELL, THAT'S WHEN
THE REALLY CRAZY STUFF BEGAN.

46:19.040 --> 46:20.803
( sobbing )
PLEASE, STOP.

46:20.910 --> 46:22.502
PLEASE, JUST...

46:22.610 --> 46:26.171
I KNEW HE SEEMED
A LITTLE TOO GOOD
TO BE TRUE.

46:26.280 --> 46:27.872
BUT I DIDN'T CARE.

46:27.980 --> 46:29.868
I WAS JUST SO HAPPY
TO MEET SOMEONE

46:29.980 --> 46:31.618
WHO SAID HE WOULDN'T
MIND HAVING CHILDREN.

46:31.720 --> 46:34.746
OH MY GOD!
CHILDREN?

46:34.860 --> 46:38.921
GEORGE MEANS WELL I SUPPOSE,
BUT HE'S NOT EXACTLY GREAT
FATHER MATERIAL.

46:39.030 --> 46:40.725
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

46:40.830 --> 46:43.048
I CAN GIVE YOU
HIS SON KYLE'S PHONE NUMBER.

46:43.160 --> 46:46.561
HE'S SWEET,
BUT SCARRED FOR LIFE.

46:48.630 --> 46:50.063
MAYBE IT'S NOT IN HERE.

46:50.170 --> 46:53.401
I CAN JUST CALL
WITH IT LATER.

46:54.510 --> 46:56.273
YOU SEEM...

46:57.580 --> 46:59.901
HOW DO I KNOW YOU'RE NOT
JUST SOME CRAZY PERSON?

47:00.010 --> 47:02.217
DO I LOOK LIKE
A CRAZY PERSON?

47:05.320 --> 47:08.983
I'M TRYING TO PROTECT SOMEONE
LIKE I WISH SOMEONE HAD
PROTECTED ME.

47:09.090 --> 47:10.910
WELL, MAYBE NONE OF THIS
IS REALLY TRUE.

47:11.020 --> 47:13.818
MAYBE YOU'RE
JUST SOME BITTER
ANGRY PSYCHOPATH.

47:13.930 --> 47:16.819
I AM NOT ANGRY!

47:19.100 --> 47:20.590
OH!

47:38.520 --> 47:41.011
Maggie:
DID YOU TELL HER
HOW YOU FEEL?

47:41.120 --> 47:42.678
Nate:
YEAH. YEAH.

47:42.790 --> 47:45.884
- Maggie: I'M SORRY.
- THANK YOU.

47:49.760 --> 47:53.161
- HEY.
- HEY.

47:53.270 --> 47:55.636
HI, BRENDA.

47:55.740 --> 47:57.958
HELLO, MAGGIE.

47:59.340 --> 48:02.878
WELL, I GUESS
I WILL TAKE MY SEAT.

48:08.410 --> 48:11.174
IT'S SORT OF A BAD TIME,
BUT I CAN TALK FOR
A SECOND.

48:11.280 --> 48:13.612
WHAT'S UP?

48:16.590 --> 48:18.683
I CAME HERE
TO SAY THAT...

48:18.790 --> 48:21.554
I FELT I'D BEEN
A BIT STUBBORN.

48:21.660 --> 48:24.356
THAT SOMEHOW
THIS WHOLE THING HAS
COME DOWN TO A CHOICE

48:24.460 --> 48:26.928
BETWEEN MY MARRIAGE
AND THIS CHILD.

48:27.030 --> 48:30.261
AND IT SEEMED RECKLESS
TO RISK MY MARRIAGE...

48:30.370 --> 48:33.203
OVER TAKING
SOME STUPID TEST.

48:33.310 --> 48:35.005
GREAT.

48:35.110 --> 48:39.444
BUT NOW
THAT I'M STANDING HERE
LOOKING AT YOU...

48:41.850 --> 48:44.546
WE'VE BEEN SO SEPARATE

48:44.650 --> 48:46.049
FOR A LONG TIME.

48:46.150 --> 48:51.053
IT'S LIKE WE'RE TOGETHER,
BUT WE'RE NOT TOGETHER.

48:51.160 --> 48:53.025
AND I'VE BEEN THINKING
THAT IT'S ME.

48:53.130 --> 48:57.021
THAT IT'S MY FEARS
OR MY HORMONES.

48:57.130 --> 48:59.769
BUT I THINK
THAT IT'S YOU.

48:59.870 --> 49:02.395
IT'S US.

49:06.110 --> 49:07.907
- LISTEN, BREN--
- NO, DON'T TOUCH ME.

49:08.010 --> 49:10.137
- CAN WE--?
- DON'T.

49:10.240 --> 49:11.935
HOW CAN
I MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER?
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

49:12.050 --> 49:14.006
OH, GOD!
JUST DO WHAT YOU WANT!

49:14.110 --> 49:16.670
FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE,
JUST DO WHAT YOU WANT.

49:16.780 --> 49:18.008
NOT WHAT YOU THINK
PEOPLE WANT

49:18.120 --> 49:21.112
OR WHAT YOU SHOULD DO.

49:21.220 --> 49:22.949
'CAUSE I DON'T
GIVE A FUCK ANYMORE.

49:23.060 --> 49:25.449
JUST-- WOULD YOU WAIT?

49:25.560 --> 49:28.256
( door opens, closes )

49:37.000 --> 49:39.161
OH, HEY.

49:39.270 --> 49:40.237
HEY.

49:47.010 --> 49:49.547
SORRY.
EXCUSE ME.

49:49.650 --> 49:50.378
OH, SURE.

50:01.960 --> 50:06.795
YOU KNOW,
I WAS AN ARTIST BEFORE
I STARTED WORKING HERE.

50:06.900 --> 50:08.219
YEAH.

50:08.330 --> 50:11.390
- WHAT?
- I WAS IN ART SCHOOL,
I MEAN.

50:11.500 --> 50:14.469
BUT I DROPPED OUT
'CAUSE I WAS SICK OF IT.

50:14.570 --> 50:17.903
AND I THOUGHT I WOULD
HAVE MORE TIME TO
JUST CREATE.

50:18.010 --> 50:20.547
EXCEPT I'VE BEEN
A LITTLE UNINSPIRED,

50:20.650 --> 50:22.675
SO I HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN
DOING MUCH OF ANYTHING.

50:22.780 --> 50:24.816
AND NOW IT SORT OF FEELS
LIKE MAYBE THAT'S OVER,

50:24.920 --> 50:29.755
WHICH IS KIND OF SCARY
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW I'VE
ALWAYS DEFINED MYSELF.

50:29.860 --> 50:32.988
BUT THEN AGAIN,
MAYBE IT'S KIND OF FREEING
IN A STRANGE WAY.

50:33.090 --> 50:34.682
( chuckles )

50:34.790 --> 50:38.021
ANYWAY, THAT'S
TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION
FROM LAST NIGHT.

50:38.130 --> 50:40.894
OH, I'M GLAD YOU
TOLD ME.

50:41.000 --> 50:44.265
