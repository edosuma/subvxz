be producing TV shows.

04:48.109 --> 04:49.917
You should be making movies.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.007
Aw, the studios
just want remakes.

Spielberg's stylle.

05:12.268 --> 05:14.731
Oh, man, I didn't sign up for this.
We're doomed.

05:14.771 --> 05:17.269
Not so fast. Here
comes the <i>War Horse</i>!

05:17.637 --> 05:19.441
-Let's get on, War Horse!
Ne, he, he, he, hey!

05:20.439 --> 05:23.227
Hope you brushed your

05:23.267 --> 05:26.384
Because we're about

05:31.802 --> 05:33.148
All, right, War Horse!

05:33.188 --> 05:35.479
-One horse can win the war?
-No.

05:35.519 --> 05:37.338
But <i>E.T.</i> may even the odds.

05:37.418 --> 05:39.418
He who give it live,

05:39.458 --> 05:41.634
can also take it away!

05:44.759 --> 05:46.264
Ouch!

05:46.344 --> 05:48.525
But I thought aliens were
supposed to be cute and cuddling.

05:48.565 --> 05:51.686
Not anymore. Killer
aliens are big box office.

05:51.766 --> 05:53.562
I keep up. I read the trades.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.923
I'm hot lights!

06:06.112 --> 06:07.902
I'm poor, black and ugly,

06:07.942 --> 06:10.621
but I'm here to
f[Bleep] you off.

06:12.450 --> 06:14.619
Celie from The Color Purple
was one bad motherf...

06:14.719 --> 06:16.073
Shut your mouth!

06:16.113 --> 06:19.481
I'm just talking about Celie from
the 1985 film "The Color Purple".

06:19.521 --> 06:21.101
Look! Here comes Tintin!

06:21.141 --> 06:24.231
Riding a velociraptor
riding jaws!

06:24.271 --> 06:26.359
Ah, don't want!
I'm out!

06:27.968 --> 06:30.551
And eyes like a doll's eyes.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.614
It's called "the On Carnivale",

06:32.654 --> 06:34.556
It happens in animation
when the human eye

06:34.557 --> 06:36.578
see something it doesn't
reconize, that's wierd,

06:36.618 --> 06:38.723
But they design over
their so photo real.

06:46.821 --> 06:48.451
We did it, Swift Wind!

06:48.531 --> 06:50.851
The Horde won't bother
us again anytime soon.

06:50.891 --> 06:52.812
Now, let's turn back into plain old

06:52.813 --> 06:54.732
Princess Adora and her horse Spirit.

06:54.772 --> 06:56.367
It' meatloaf night
back at the castle.

06:56.407 --> 06:58.210
No, no, wait, wait, let
me land before you...

06:59.167 --> 07:01.255
Oh, my God, bitch!

07:01.335 --> 07:03.674
I told you to wait for five
f[Bleep]ing seconds.

07:03.754 --> 07:06.260
Spirit, I am so sorry!

07:06.340 --> 07:08.488
This is like a simple
"rule of five" [Bleep] cab.

07:08.528 --> 07:12.151
If we're in the air, I need
my magic [Bleep]ing wings.

07:12.191 --> 07:14.560
For the love of God,
get me a [Bleep]ing doctor.

07:15.174 --> 07:17.185
A Doctor can't help you.

07:17.225 --> 07:19.092
Wait a minute!
You f[Bleep] up the

07:19.093 --> 07:21.192
landing and I get
the death penalty?

07:21.272 --> 07:23.267
A horse's broken
leg will never heal.

07:23.307 --> 07:26.238
Almost fifty percent of a
horse's bones are in its limbs.

07:26.318 --> 07:27.914
Besides which
sixty-five percent of a

07:27.915 --> 07:29.909
horse's weight rest
in its front legs.

07:29.989 --> 07:31.696
You show a loaded
up bold barrows

07:31.736 --> 07:34.622
with the Lara Hard caliber
euthanasia factoid, Sister.

07:34.702 --> 07:36.121
Have you been planning for this?

07:36.161 --> 07:38.334
It's just part of being a
responsible horse owner.

07:38.414 --> 07:40.665
Oh, my Godness!
What's happened?

07:40.705 --> 07:42.838
Oh, it's terrible, Castaspella

07:42.918 --> 07:45.575
That evil Hordak made
us switch bodies again.

07:45.615 --> 07:48.636
I'm really Princess Adora,
and she's really Spirit.

07:48.716 --> 07:50.466
Well, that's easily remedied

07:50.506 --> 07:52.747
-Magical mind swap!
-Wait!

07:55.062 --> 07:56.511
Oh, my leg!

07:56.551 --> 08:00.239
Well, you know, sixty-five percent
of the bones, blah, blah, blah...

08:00.909 --> 08:04.658
I am magic. I could
fix that in two seconds.

08:04.698 --> 08:06.987
Heh. Whose up for a meatloaf?

08:07.859 --> 08:10.757
<i>It's the top of
the hour on KGI AM 780.</i>

08:10.797 --> 08:14.620
<i>♪ AM radio is still exist. ♪</i>

08:16.003 --> 08:17.875
Aha, the perfect plan.

08:17.915 --> 08:21.762
Security would notice Skeletor
and Beast Man sneaking in,

08:21.802 --> 08:24.447
but as babies, we
are undetectable.

08:24.487 --> 08:27.758
Ah, I dont't like this Boss.
When can we turn back?

08:27.838 --> 08:29.771
The spell wears off in one hour.

08:29.811 --> 08:32.596
By then, we'll have infiltraded
the royal chambers and...

08:35.131 --> 08:37.609
How mentioned of
that did you hear?

08:37.649 --> 08:40.150
What you're doing?
Oh, my God!

08:40.191 --> 08:42.313
That's discusting!

08:42.394 --> 08:44.107
What are you complaining about?

08:44.148 --> 08:46.875
I'm the one with the
high and beast senses.

08:46.915 --> 08:49.336
You don't even have a nose.

08:49.376 --> 08:52.741
I smell with my tongue.
That's how my body compensates.

08:57.091 --> 08:59.333
Ok, over the fence on three.

08:59.373 --> 09:01.677
One... two... three!

09:04.950 --> 09:07.192
These puny arms are worthless!

09:07.232 --> 09:09.637
Eighty percent of my
body weight is in my head!

09:10.518 --> 09:13.248
Oh, God, no! Get away
you little turd burglar.

09:13.830 --> 09:15.839
Oh, what a bad baby.

09:15.879 --> 09:17.636
No pushing!

09:17.676 --> 09:19.977
Hey, this isn't so bad.

09:20.057 --> 09:23.480
Oh, yeah! Baby wants more!

09:24.433 --> 09:27.609
-Boss, how do you want...
-Silence, Beast Man.

09:27.689 --> 09:30.779
I'm... uh, adding a
new face to my plan.

09:49.962 --> 09:51.324
Oho, yeah!

09:51.364 --> 09:55.382
Spank the blue of
my bad baby bottom!

09:57.177 --> 09:59.349
Oh, my gosh!
It's Skeletor!

10:00.159 --> 10:01.518
Oh, f[Bleep].

10:01.598 --> 10:04.796
I, King Randor, award
this medal of honor

10:04.836 --> 10:07.351
to Eternia's greatest champion.

10:08.605 --> 10:10.613
Skeletor, if
it wasn't for you,

10:10.653 --> 10:12.556
generations of children
would have suffered

10:12.557 --> 10:14.423
at the hands of
that abusive nanny.

10:14.463 --> 10:17.570
Her cicle of violence
is forever broken.

10:17.942 --> 10:19.287
Thank you.

10:21.167 --> 10:23.545
Aw... Hello? Boss?
