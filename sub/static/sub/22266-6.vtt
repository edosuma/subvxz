The men your son investigated,

00:07.799 --> 00:11.008
when they discovered his arrest,
they broke into prison.

00:11.094 --> 00:13.256
Take him.
They are called the Jackals.

00:13.764 --> 00:15.926
- You let my boy go.
- We need your son.

Hello, Father.

00:23.565 --> 00:24.931
It's been a long time...

00:29.071 --> 00:30.528
You should have stayed dead.

SLADE: I heard you were in trouble, kid.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.157
So I thought I'd offer my help.

00:35.536 --> 00:36.572
My old man.

00:37.162 --> 00:39.529
Here to save me. Last I saw,

00:39.623 --> 00:41.740
you weren't all that concerned
with saving anyone.

00:50.926 --> 00:53.418
- Patricide?
- He's seen our operation.

00:54.388 --> 00:55.924
Makes him a liability.

00:56.139 --> 00:57.801
Yeah, you can have that choice.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.132
But I'll give you another one.

00:59.643 --> 01:01.054
Let me join you.

01:02.354 --> 01:03.890
If I wanted a family reunion,

01:04.105 --> 01:05.642
I would have sent an invitation.

01:05.941 --> 01:07.057
Maybe you did.

01:07.859 --> 01:10.693
But you just haven't
realized it yet, kid.

01:11.113 --> 01:13.571
See, I came all this way to
speak with you.

01:13.657 --> 01:16.320
And I will kill anybody
who gets in my way

01:16.702 --> 01:20.366
because I got nothing left to lose,
only you.

01:22.541 --> 01:23.748
So go ahead.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.454
And make a decision.

01:35.178 --> 01:38.637
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't
swayed by the poetry of it all.

01:39.683 --> 01:40.799

01:42.185 --> 01:43.892
Trust is built upon honesty.

of questions to ask me.

questions for you, Joe.

you something different

16:48.341 --> 16:50.958
I ran facial recognition off of
John's body cam footage.

16:51.427 --> 16:54.591
Meet Ricardo Diaz and his extensive
criminal record.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.672
Does anyone want to guess
what his street name is?

16:57.600 --> 16:58.807
Anyone want to guess?

16:59.101 --> 17:02.310
You guys are no fun.
His street name is Dragon.

17:02.647 --> 17:04.309
DINAH: This jerk wad's been out of
prison less than a month.

17:04.397 --> 17:05.934
He's really racked up a body count.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.017
RENE: This guy was doing double jolts
of life plus one.

17:08.109 --> 17:09.692
CURTIS: What's that?
DINAH: It's life without parole.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.103
What's he doing walking around?

17:11.196 --> 17:13.689
State Supreme court overturned
his convictions due to technicalities.

17:13.782 --> 17:15.775
But before he was on the inside,
he was running with a group called

17:15.867 --> 17:17.233
the Scorpions in the Glades.

17:17.912 --> 17:19.824
John, do you know anything
about the Scorpions?

17:20.830 --> 17:21.867
John?

17:22.208 --> 17:24.244
John, John, Earth to John Diggle.
The Scorpions?

17:24.417 --> 17:27.502
The Scorpions, yeah, I know them.

17:27.588 --> 17:31.002
But Diaz is on something different.
New muscle, new crew. Way too organized.

17:31.092 --> 17:32.833
RENE: Wonder when he got himself
a new crew.

17:33.177 --> 17:34.463
How he got to be the boss of it.

17:34.637 --> 17:36.754
Why he needs a weapons grade 3D printer.

17:36.931 --> 17:39.423
I think I have the answer to that.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.933
Drugs. High-end ones.

17:42.019 --> 17:43.726
I cross-referenced
the two models that were stolen

17:43.813 --> 17:46.430
and what they have in common is
their capacity to simultaneously print

17:46.524 --> 17:48.937
inert polypropylenes
and soft material catalyst composites.

17:49.151 --> 17:51.734
Did anyone understand a word of that?

17:51.946 --> 17:53.528
You think Diaz is making reactionware?

17:53.698 --> 17:55.690
- Anyone normal.
- With this equipment?

17:56.409 --> 17:58.742
- Diaz cuts out the middle man.
- He can make designer drugs

17:58.828 --> 18:01.241
more cheaply and efficiently
than anyone else on the street.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.162
Yeah, well, the hell he is.

So what are you planning
with all these explosives?

18:30.192 --> 18:31.182
I'd like to know.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.477
You missed your kill shot with
the soldier back there.

18:33.571 --> 18:36.780
Well, when I lost this eye,
I lost my depth perception.

18:37.074 --> 18:40.158

you joined me under false pretenses.

- But you were physically compromised.

21:40.758 --> 21:42.340
An experimental steroid.

I know it was the wrong call.

- I'm sorry.
- I'm just glad you finally told me.

anything that A.R.G.U.S. is working

21:56.899 --> 21:59.437
I thought it was just
some kind of steroid.

Yeah, we found out that
the manufacturer's involved in

That's where they'll be.

25:22.062 --> 25:23.052
You sure?

25:24.356 --> 25:25.972
That my father would try
to stop us?

25:26.316 --> 25:27.648
That's what fathers do.

25:28.819 --> 25:30.310
And that's why I'm gonna kill him.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.950
Before they captured me,
I saw what Kane was going after.

25:39.538 --> 25:43.623
Attacking the water supply, it's a
death sentence for half the country.

25:44.251 --> 25:46.618

be able to stop them.

25:51.091 --> 25:52.332
If that's what you want.

25:55.846 --> 25:57.337
I spared your life back there.

25:58.307 --> 25:59.297
I know.

26:00.142 --> 26:02.384
Back there, it didn't feel like an act

26:02.478 --> 26:05.471
the same way it did with Chase
back on Lian Yu.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.351
Because when I saw my son,

26:08.859 --> 26:10.066
I was tempted.

26:11.737 --> 26:13.820
I would have done anything
to keep us together.

26:14.364 --> 26:16.572
But when you mentioned William,

26:17.367 --> 26:19.199
I realized that's not my boy.

26:22.581 --> 26:23.697
It's Kane.

26:24.541 --> 26:28.535
And what I fear is there's
only one way to stop him.

26:29.379 --> 26:30.369
Slade.

26:31.507 --> 26:34.966
There are other ways to deal with this
that don't involve killing your son.

26:35.552 --> 26:38.920
Deep down, he's your boy
so you have to reason with him.

26:39.139 --> 26:41.096
And I swear, he will listen to you.

26:41.308 --> 26:43.846
But I didn't tell you what happened
after Lian Yu.

26:44.603 --> 26:48.517
I went home to my son and I promised him

26:48.607 --> 26:50.223
I would stay and never leave.

26:50.776 --> 26:52.108
And I broke that promise.

26:52.194 --> 26:54.436
You broke the promise
because of the Mirakuru.

26:54.530 --> 26:56.317
The Mirakuru faded for a while.

26:56.824 --> 26:58.611
But when it came back,
it was like a storm

26:58.700 --> 27:00.032
I could not control.

27:01.495 --> 27:05.455
And that monster is what my son
is trying to emulate.

27:06.333 --> 27:10.247
But it's not Mirakuru with Joe.
It's anger and resentment.

27:11.839 --> 27:13.876

how that can be redeemed.

- All charges are set.

30:59.691 --> 31:02.183
- Looks like it should be you.
- I hired you to pull the trigger.

31:02.903 --> 31:05.236
Move out! Get to a safe distance.

31:05.655 --> 31:07.647
Semtex makes for a pretty big bang.

31:08.033 --> 31:09.945

- I want a good view.

(CHUCKLES) You're crazy. I love it.

31:13.538 --> 31:15.279
Don't forget what you said
about the Semtex.

31:20.170 --> 31:21.411
I knew you'd show up.

31:25.217 --> 31:27.459
I think it's time we had ourselves
an honest talk.

That's what you said to me.
But you lied.

31:47.155 --> 31:49.067
You know life is not that simple, Joe.

31:49.741 --> 31:50.822
That's not my name.

31:51.535 --> 31:54.027
How could you forgive Oliver Queen
after what he did to you?

31:54.329 --> 31:56.696
Because he forgave me for far worse.

31:56.873 --> 31:58.956
Sins that I have to carry to the grave.

31:59.418 --> 32:01.080
A curse I didn't want to pass on to you.

32:02.295 --> 32:04.912
All of this anger and resentment.

32:05.382 --> 32:07.248
It's time to bring it to an end, son.

32:07.342 --> 32:08.332
No.

What you saw was the Mirakuru.

32:48.383 --> 32:49.419
Stop lying!

That little father-son trip.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.020
would be all about you and me.

33:22.334 --> 33:23.791
Something Mother never told you.

33:24.961 --> 33:26.077
I have a brother.

33:27.881 --> 33:29.213
His name is Grant.

33:29.633 --> 33:31.420
Mother didn't want him in this world.

But me,

I'm my father's son.

33:36.264 --> 33:39.382
I made my first kill six months
after our camping trip.

33:39.851 --> 33:41.092
I slit his throat,

33:42.854 --> 33:44.015
just like you did.

33:44.689 --> 33:46.976
I wanted to be exactly like my father.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.066
Like Deathstroke.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.159
I'm not Deathstroke

34:03.959 --> 34:04.949
anymore.

34:07.963 --> 34:09.498
Then you're not my father anymore.

He's gone.

Spoke with our friend, the Warden.

Jackals are in custody,
and he is very relieved.

35:01.057 --> 35:02.047
You all right?

35:02.851 --> 35:03.841
My son.

35:05.061 --> 35:07.394
He saw me kill a man
before the Mirakuru.

Before Deathstroke.

No. Don't blame yourself, Slade,
it doesn't help.

35:14.696 --> 35:15.903
You know why I do.

35:16.781 --> 35:18.272
Never give up on family.

35:19.659 --> 35:20.820
That's what you told me.

35:21.661 --> 35:22.993
It's time for you to go home.

35:24.414 --> 35:25.404
Where will you go?

- You ever need my help again,

You have your own son to protect.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.225
I'm not gonna put that at risk again.

Thank you, kid.

Hey.

36:24.849 --> 36:27.307
I just saw a news report
on the lab explosion.

36:27.852 --> 36:29.718
Looks like you took down his operation.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.062
With plenty of collateral damage.

36:32.273 --> 36:33.730
Yeah, well, that part was all Diaz.

36:34.734 --> 36:36.441
He was willing to blow up the works.

36:37.654 --> 36:38.644
Kill all of his men.

36:38.905 --> 36:41.773

destroy the drugs?

the very thing

that allowed me to put on
that hood,

the explosion.

- That's good.
- So what did I miss?

38:25.762 --> 38:27.754
Well, Raisa made me clean my room.

38:27.847 --> 38:29.839
Felice and I ate
ice cream for dinner.

38:30.016 --> 38:31.552
And I got an A on my science project.

38:31.643 --> 38:32.633
You got an A?

38:32.852 --> 38:34.343
- Yeah.
- That's fantastic.

38:34.521 --> 38:36.353
- Is it here, can I see it?
- Yeah, sure.

It's a bottle rocket, went 300 feet,
farthest in the whole school.

- Unbelievable. All right.
- I'll go get it.

38:43.154 --> 38:44.440
Pretty cool!

38:45.198 --> 38:48.032
I hope you don't mind that I'm here.
William said that he was kind of

38:48.117 --> 38:50.154
getting sick of Raisa,
and the ice cream for dinner,

38:50.245 --> 38:52.862
it was Rocky Road, so technically
the nut should count as protein.

- Me too.

to not be the Green Arrow.

- Good.

I can show you how it works.

- Yes.

(SIGHS)

39:45.466 --> 39:46.582
that was my rock bottom.

39:47.969 --> 39:50.507
I should have told you all about
the tremor from the beginning.

39:51.264 --> 39:53.631
- I'm truly sorry I didn't.
- So you're saying

39:53.892 --> 39:57.385
the tremor started before
Black Siren showed her face

39:57.478 --> 39:58.810
- in Star City?
- Yes.

And that's why, Rene, I owe you
the biggest apology of all.

You should've known what was going on
before we ever got to that bridge, man.

All I can ask is that you forgive me,
but I understand if you can't.

40:17.874 --> 40:19.331
Getting shot wasn't great.

40:20.043 --> 40:21.909
But if I'm counting the times
you saved my life

40:22.003 --> 40:23.710
against the times you almost
got me killed,

to start off with an NCV test first.
