01:39.422 --> 01:40.721
Take me to the cemetery.

01:40.723 --> 01:41.789
She's still alive.

01:41.791 --> 01:42.890
This better be good.

01:42.892 --> 01:45.229
I wish I could say it was.

01:58.576 --> 02:01.108
It started the other night, Lew.

02:01.110 --> 02:02.944
I was alone in my office.

02:02.946 --> 02:06.148
Nothing in there seemed like
it belonged to me anymore

02:06.150 --> 02:07.252
including me.

02:08.318 --> 02:10.383
Goodnight, Drake

02:10.386 --> 02:12.589
It's a shame what happened.

02:26.302 --> 02:28.303
We're closed.

02:28.305 --> 02:30.207
Roland Drake?

02:32.109 --> 02:33.375
Possibly.

02:33.377 --> 02:34.942
I want to see you.

02:34.944 --> 02:36.611
Well pick up a
local gossip rag.

02:36.613 --> 02:37.545
You'll see plenty.

02:37.547 --> 02:38.879
I do read the papers.

02:38.881 --> 02:40.148
I gathered you weren't
planning on being

02:40.150 --> 02:42.116
a very busy man anymore.

02:42.118 --> 02:43.551
Nice.

02:43.553 --> 02:44.652
That doesn't
change the fact that I need

02:44.654 --> 02:46.591
to see you... now.

02:46.924 --> 02:48.090
Come back tomorrow.

02:48.092 --> 02:49.724
I won't be busy then either.

02:49.726 --> 02:51.829
I'm downstairs.

02:52.830 --> 02:54.029
I said now.

02:54.031 --> 02:56.365
Well I can't say
no to a lady...

02:59.369 --> 03:00.137
or you.

03:02.406 --> 03:04.372
I made a
feeble attempted to straighten

03:04.374 --> 03:09.411
things up for her, to hide
the inward chaos of my life

03:09.413 --> 03:12.583
before her shadow
eclipsed everything.

03:14.450 --> 03:15.285
It's open.

03:20.557 --> 03:23.057
Never thought you'd save me?

03:23.059 --> 03:25.092
Give me time.

03:25.094 --> 03:28.263
Looks like you
only have 30 days.

03:28.265 --> 03:31.836
All right so how can
I help you missus...

03:33.069 --> 03:34.404
Miss Montemar.

03:39.976 --> 03:41.310
Of course.

03:41.312 --> 03:42.510
She had a face

03:42.512 --> 03:45.212
that would launch
1,000 ships and a body

03:45.214 --> 03:47.049
that would bring them back.

03:47.051 --> 03:49.283
You mentioned needing saving.

03:49.285 --> 03:51.085
Sadly it's not coincidence
that I've come to you,

03:51.087 --> 03:52.554
Mr. Drake.

03:52.556 --> 03:54.855
I didn't think that
this was a happy accident.

03:54.857 --> 03:56.091
Wise ass.

03:56.093 --> 03:57.325
Wait till you get to
know the rest of me.

03:57.327 --> 03:58.592
I'm not here to get
to know the rest of you.

03:58.594 --> 04:00.127
Pity.

04:00.129 --> 04:00.795
I'm here
to find out what happened

04:00.797 --> 04:01.462
to my father.

04:01.464 --> 04:02.730
Montemar?

04:02.732 --> 04:03.764
Didn't I read something
about him going missing

04:03.766 --> 04:05.266
in the papers last week?

04:05.268 --> 04:07.369
I think my entire family's
in danger, Mr. Drake.

04:07.371 --> 04:08.203
Who do you think did it?

04:08.205 --> 04:09.738
I don't know.

04:09.740 --> 04:12.039
Oh come on, Miss Montemar,
we both read the papers.

04:12.041 --> 04:13.908
I don't believe the
story you're selling,

04:13.910 --> 04:15.310
so why don't you just
take it to the cops.

04:15.312 --> 04:16.543
He's missing.

04:16.546 --> 04:17.813
I don't know that
he's been murdered.

04:17.815 --> 04:19.414
And, the cops, yes,
they were very nice.

04:19.416 --> 04:20.781
First time for anything.

04:20.784 --> 04:22.383
They took his name
down, told me to call

04:22.385 --> 04:23.585
if I heard from him.

04:23.587 --> 04:25.020
Real helpful.

04:25.022 --> 04:26.520
Well you want some
more real helpful advice?

04:26.522 --> 04:28.556
You know from the papers
that missing persons cases

04:28.558 --> 04:30.827
and me don't mix real well.

04:32.363 --> 04:34.429
I don't play the
fool for anybody.

04:34.431 --> 04:36.267
I'd like my desk back.

04:40.303 --> 04:42.003
Wait.

04:43.840 --> 04:45.575
Wait a week and call.

04:47.977 --> 04:50.611
I can't wait a week.

04:50.613 --> 04:53.614
My uncle's gone missing now too.

04:53.616 --> 04:55.015
I'm not that guy.

04:55.017 --> 04:56.184
I'm not the guy in the papers.

04:56.186 --> 04:57.551
I wouldn't let anything
happen to anyone.

04:57.553 --> 04:59.821
I knew you weren't.

04:59.823 --> 05:00.789
Please.

05:05.962 --> 05:07.130
Miss Montemar.

05:08.498 --> 05:09.499
Katherine.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.535
I'm sorry this
happened to you.

05:13.537 --> 05:15.236
I don't want sorry.

05:15.238 --> 05:16.772
I want solved.

05:16.774 --> 05:18.140
And, unless they find a body,
my father's never going to be

05:18.142 --> 05:20.642
considered dead
which is why I want

05:20.644 --> 05:24.816
more than his name in a list
and a phone call in a week.

05:26.849 --> 05:29.583
Mr. Drake, in the papers,
you said that you were

05:29.585 --> 05:33.023
the best missing
persons man in the city.

05:33.890 --> 05:35.292
Are you the best?

05:36.527 --> 05:37.428
Find out.

05:40.063 --> 05:42.397
So how does this work?

05:42.399 --> 05:45.232
It's working right now.

05:45.234 --> 05:46.136
Shall we?

05:49.705 --> 05:51.172
Yeah I think we
should probably start

05:51.174 --> 05:53.508
with how he went missing.

05:53.510 --> 05:54.342
Dinner.

05:54.344 --> 05:55.844
Okay.

05:55.846 --> 05:58.112
No, my father and I were
supposed to have dinner

05:58.114 --> 05:59.246
at home.

05:59.248 --> 06:01.782
Oh, you still live at home?

06:01.784 --> 06:03.785
Yes Mr. Drake,
I'm not married.

06:03.787 --> 06:04.621
Oh good.

06:05.988 --> 06:07.121
Why what does that
have to do with anything?

06:07.123 --> 06:08.924
Nothing, that's for me.

06:08.926 --> 06:11.325
So I take it dad never showed?

06:11.327 --> 06:14.962
No, we haven't seen
him since Tuesday.

06:14.964 --> 06:18.301
Does dad have a
habit of disappearing?

06:23.707 --> 06:25.172
I don't know what kind
of people you're accustomed

06:25.174 --> 06:26.575
to dealing with,
Mr. Drake, but we're

06:26.577 --> 06:27.912
a normal family.

06:28.979 --> 06:30.778
We're the victims here.

06:30.780 --> 06:32.580
Usually the victim
knows the assailant.

06:32.582 --> 06:33.881
The assailant feels justified.

06:33.883 --> 06:35.650
So I have to ask this question

06:35.652 --> 06:38.787
how did your family become
rich, Miss Montemar?

06:38.789 --> 06:42.657
I am suddenly very sure
of one thing, Mr. Drake,

06:42.659 --> 06:46.427
I don't have the
best man for the job.

06:46.429 --> 06:48.996
Yeah, there's one
thing you've forgotten.

06:48.998 --> 06:50.799
Oh really?

06:50.801 --> 06:51.635
Do tell.

06:54.003 --> 06:55.804
How would it look with
pieces of your clothing

06:55.806 --> 06:57.375
all over my office?

07:00.277 --> 07:02.710
Well you're the dective.

07:02.712 --> 07:04.145
You tell me.

08:22.291 --> 08:24.159
So you gonna invite me in?

08:24.161 --> 08:25.594
Actually I'm right
in the middle of...

08:25.596 --> 08:28.095
Hey, hate the DA not me.

08:28.097 --> 08:29.965
You didn't listen to me.

08:29.967 --> 08:32.700
Yeah MacDonald, I
appreciate what you...

08:32.702 --> 08:34.469
Up kind of late again?

08:34.471 --> 08:36.870
Yeah actually I
was just waking up.

08:36.871 --> 08:41.609
Well I know you're going
through a hard patch, buddy.

08:41.611 --> 08:43.110
It's okay.

08:43.111 --> 08:45.980
Actually things have started
to pick up since you left.

08:45.982 --> 08:50.951
Well you made me too good
a detective to believe that.

08:50.953 --> 08:52.821
I can't believe the
newspapers are making

08:52.823 --> 08:55.623
such a stew about
that missing girl.

08:55.625 --> 08:59.226
You'd think that
you'd kidnapped her.

08:59.228 --> 09:02.663
Yeah, well I appreciate
you backing me up.

09:02.665 --> 09:03.600
Oh I see.

09:06.770 --> 09:09.874
Well I didn't know
you weren't alone.

09:13.776 --> 09:14.908
Anyone you know?

09:14.910 --> 09:15.877
I'm alone.

09:15.879 --> 09:17.646
I wanna be alone.

09:17.648 --> 09:18.749
Okay, sure.

09:19.915 --> 09:20.882
Can I use your bathroom?

09:20.884 --> 09:21.719
No.

09:22.653 --> 09:23.654
All right.

09:31.595 --> 09:34.295
This came for you at my office.

09:34.297 --> 09:36.364
If you could take
care of your half,

09:36.366 --> 09:37.831
well I'd appreciate it.

09:37.833 --> 09:39.968
Here let me take it.

09:39.970 --> 09:42.604
Hope you get things
straightened out, my friend.

09:42.606 --> 09:47.075
Like I said, I just need
some time to get on my feet.

09:47.077 --> 09:48.643
You take care of yourself.

09:51.581 --> 09:53.715
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

10:00.256 --> 10:01.623
Roland Drake?

10:01.625 --> 10:02.623
Possibly.

10:02.625 --> 10:05.125
I need to see you.

10:05.127 --> 10:07.327
Katherine, what's going on?

10:07.329 --> 10:08.595
I need to see you.

10:08.597 --> 10:10.098
Can we meet at your office?

10:10.100 --> 10:12.066
Yeah no, I'm not gonna be
in the office today actually.

10:12.068 --> 10:13.236
Now.

10:14.170 --> 10:15.505
Yeah, oh yeah.

10:17.573 --> 10:18.409
Right.

10:22.879 --> 10:26.550
You see Lew, business
is picking up already.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.651
Of course it is.

10:29.653 --> 10:33.654
You might want to
get your door fixed.

10:33.656 --> 10:35.592
Someone might break in.

10:38.694 --> 10:40.461
Lew,
after I watched you walk away,

10:40.463 --> 10:42.763
I went over my place
again and again.

10:42.765 --> 10:46.133
How did this happen,
and I never woke up?

10:46.135 --> 10:48.268
With every passing
minute, I was feeling

10:48.270 --> 10:50.537
like it happened in a
dream, like I'd fallen

10:50.539 --> 10:51.541
for a ghost.

10:53.009 --> 10:55.744
I needed to get back to the
only place I could think.

11:31.781 --> 11:34.748
I caught a whiff of perfume
like sweet temptation.

11:34.750 --> 11:37.218
Last thing I needed.

11:37.220 --> 11:39.620
Sorry I'm closed.

11:39.622 --> 11:41.122
Actually I'm expecting someone.

11:41.124 --> 11:44.558
More correctly,
you were expecting me.

11:44.560 --> 11:46.062
No, no I wasn't.

11:47.597 --> 11:49.330
Who are you?

11:49.332 --> 11:50.864
I'm scared, Mr. Drake.

11:50.866 --> 11:52.032
Why?

11:52.034 --> 11:53.534
I'm Jennifer.

11:53.536 --> 11:55.202
Why the gun?

11:55.204 --> 11:57.705
Katherine's sister.

12:01.944 --> 12:03.344
Katherine?

12:03.346 --> 12:04.979
Don't you make a habit
of remembering the names

12:04.981 --> 12:06.848
of the ladies that come to you?

12:06.850 --> 12:09.316
I remember if it's business.

12:09.318 --> 12:11.686
Well then I'm surprised
you don't remember Katherine.

12:11.688 --> 12:15.123
I expect you gave her quit
the business last night.

12:15.125 --> 12:17.425
Look why are you here?

12:17.427 --> 12:19.761
I'm here to find out
what you did to my sister.

12:19.763 --> 12:21.396
Now are you gonna help me
or are you just sticking

12:21.398 --> 12:22.763
your nose where
it doesn't belong?

12:22.765 --> 12:23.697
Look lady...

12:23.699 --> 12:25.899
Or is nose off the mark?

12:25.901 --> 12:28.469
How can I help you, sister?

12:28.471 --> 12:31.940
You are still a detective
after all, aren't you Mr. Drake?

12:31.942 --> 12:33.106
I mean perhaps not
a very good one.

12:33.108 --> 12:35.542
Let's see remembering
things would be

12:35.544 --> 12:37.380
a minimum requirement.

12:40.015 --> 12:43.250
Do you remember my name,
or have I given you

12:43.252 --> 12:45.021
enough to go on, huh?

12:48.858 --> 12:51.658
I remember if it's
important, Jennifer.

12:51.660 --> 12:53.229
That's my business.

12:54.364 --> 12:55.997
And, I remain too much
of a lady to inquire

12:55.999 --> 12:59.133
what you do remember
about Katherine.

12:59.135 --> 13:02.237
She came her last
night, didn't she?

13:02.239 --> 13:03.073
She did.

13:03.939 --> 13:06.007
It was before closing.

13:06.009 --> 13:08.178
Yeah, now she's missing.

13:09.545 --> 13:12.046
People in my family
are missing, Mr. Drake.

13:12.048 --> 13:13.116
Where is she?

13:14.217 --> 13:15.215
Where is she?

13:15.217 --> 13:18.418
What did you do to my sister?

13:18.420 --> 13:20.924
Beyond the obvious, nothing.

13:22.058 --> 13:23.561
Don't lie to me!

13:24.928 --> 13:28.599
Please Mr. Drake, my entire
life is disappearing.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.399
If my father is dead,
then Katherine stands

13:32.401 --> 13:35.869
to inherit my entire
family fortune.

13:35.871 --> 13:38.005
Now I can't find Katherine.

13:38.007 --> 13:39.576
That makes me next.

13:41.544 --> 13:44.711
All right, that
I will remember.

13:44.713 --> 13:46.214
And, then I wake
up this morning,

13:46.216 --> 13:49.783
and I see this envelope full
of pictures of the two of you.

13:49.785 --> 13:51.819
Yeah, real nice.

13:51.821 --> 13:53.553
I want to know what's
going on right now!

13:53.555 --> 13:54.622
All right, calm down!

13:54.624 --> 13:56.090
Those guns go off.

13:56.092 --> 13:57.191
You want to sit down?

13:57.193 --> 13:58.125
No.

13:58.127 --> 13:59.860
I'd like to call the police now.

13:59.862 --> 14:00.795
Fine.

14:00.797 --> 14:02.430
You know what after last night,

14:02.432 --> 14:05.667
I feel like I was
practically in your family.

14:05.669 --> 14:07.270
I like your family.

14:08.404 --> 14:10.470
Your sister came to me.

14:10.472 --> 14:12.572
I'm not so sure about that.

14:12.574 --> 14:15.008
Why don't we call the police
now, and we'll just all

14:15.010 --> 14:17.644
look at these pictures
together, okay?

14:17.646 --> 14:18.680
Fine, why don't we do that?

14:18.682 --> 14:19.513
Good.

14:32.728 --> 14:36.400
What are you gonna do
to me know, Mr. Drake?

14:37.600 --> 14:40.504
Unfortunately I'm
gonna go to plan B.

14:41.938 --> 14:44.806
I'm gonna offer you a seat
and a chance to listen.

15:05.562 --> 15:07.095
Well it seems you have
more than just a professional

15:07.097 --> 15:11.965
interest in missing persons
cases, don't you detective?

15:16.106 --> 15:18.138
I don't get it.

15:18.140 --> 15:20.273
Someone wants you
to think something.

15:20.275 --> 15:24.345
But, that somebody thought
they had an airtight frame,

15:24.347 --> 15:26.714
they would've sent these
things to the cops,

15:26.716 --> 15:29.017
not to you in the morning.

15:29.019 --> 15:30.254
I'm disarmed.

15:31.453 --> 15:34.022
I guess now I have to
take your word for it.

15:34.024 --> 15:37.492
Look you've got the
wrong idea about me.

15:37.494 --> 15:38.329
Oh do I?

15:39.228 --> 15:40.427
Good.

15:40.429 --> 15:41.896
Because I would
really like to know

15:41.898 --> 15:45.633
what do you think
is going on here?

15:45.635 --> 15:49.003
I want to find out what
happened to Katherine.

15:49.005 --> 15:52.507
I just don't want to get
involved in it with you.

15:52.509 --> 15:55.575
You don't get involved
in this with me now,

15:55.577 --> 15:58.012
and I make sure all of these
photos go to the police.

15:58.014 --> 16:00.547
And, given your current
reputation, oh yeah.

16:00.549 --> 16:02.617
All right fine.

16:02.619 --> 16:04.855
We're in business together.

16:06.990 --> 16:09.891
I normally make $35 a day.

16:09.893 --> 16:11.691
We'll have to talk about that.

16:11.693 --> 16:14.228
Yeah, well we're need
to talk about the jewelry.

16:14.230 --> 16:15.466
What jewelry?

16:19.903 --> 16:23.671
Come on, dumb's the one
thing that does't look good

16:23.673 --> 16:25.105
on you.

16:25.107 --> 16:27.075
We both know that the
jewelry had something to do

16:27.077 --> 16:28.475
with this case.

16:28.477 --> 16:30.912
What do you know
about the diamond?

16:30.914 --> 16:33.648
The gem was one of the
things that came up last night.

16:33.650 --> 16:35.649
It's so valuable how come
everyone in the world

16:35.651 --> 16:37.118
isn't looking for it?

16:37.120 --> 16:39.220
My father brought
it back secretly,

16:39.222 --> 16:41.189
so only those of us in
the family even know

16:41.191 --> 16:43.157
we need to be looking for it.

16:43.159 --> 16:45.593
It could be very dangerous
for those that do know.

16:45.595 --> 16:48.495
Well I'm being very
selective, Mr. Drake.

16:48.497 --> 16:50.364
I always get picked
for the good stuff.

17:00.043 --> 17:01.008
Selective?

17:01.010 --> 17:02.210
Who's this?

17:02.212 --> 17:04.645
I've never seen him
before in my life!

17:13.021 --> 17:14.186
Who are you?

17:15.992 --> 17:17.590
What do you want?

17:17.593 --> 17:18.626
Who are you?

17:22.332 --> 17:25.832
He was gonna, I
thought he might stab.

17:25.834 --> 17:28.034
Oh my God, is he dead?

17:28.036 --> 17:30.437
Yes, thanks to you.

17:30.439 --> 17:34.774
Now that gun shot's not
gonna go unnoticed for long.

17:34.776 --> 17:38.446
Are you sure you
don't recognize him?

17:38.448 --> 17:40.080
I don't know him.

17:40.082 --> 17:42.349
Well he seems to know you,
and somebody slit his throat

17:42.351 --> 17:44.385
and didn't finish the job.

17:44.387 --> 17:46.253
A dying assassin?

17:46.255 --> 17:49.823
Maybe he found me
because of Katherine.

17:51.393 --> 17:53.360
Hey Drake, you
all right in there?

17:53.362 --> 17:55.061
We heard something.

17:55.063 --> 17:56.531
- We're fine.
- We're fine.

18:00.769 --> 18:03.003
There's nothing in his
pocket except a matchbook

18:03.005 --> 18:04.772
from the Wiltmore Hotel.

18:04.774 --> 18:05.740
This mean anything to you?

18:05.742 --> 18:07.675
No, I wish it did.

18:07.677 --> 18:10.043
Jennifer, this is murder.

18:10.045 --> 18:11.779
Oh if we're gonna have
to talk about murder,

18:11.781 --> 18:13.246
then maybe we're gonna
have to tell the police

18:13.248 --> 18:15.849
how you were with my missing
sister all last night,

18:15.851 --> 18:17.251
and that I have pictures.

18:17.253 --> 18:18.819
The police are gonna love you.

18:18.821 --> 18:19.853
I don't need love.

18:19.855 --> 18:21.589
I need help.

18:21.591 --> 18:23.456
Claude, are you still there?

18:23.458 --> 18:25.626
Yeah,
but you got company.

18:25.628 --> 18:27.427
I'm just trying to
help a lady out here.

18:27.429 --> 18:29.397
Something fell.

18:29.399 --> 18:31.032
All right
it's nothing folks.

18:31.034 --> 18:32.699
Something fell.

18:32.701 --> 18:33.935
Lots of blood.

18:33.937 --> 18:35.302
Don't worry about
it, I'm being evicted.

18:35.304 --> 18:36.236
No.

18:36.238 --> 18:38.472
Okay get that rug.

18:38.474 --> 18:39.907
He's bleeding everywhere.

18:39.909 --> 18:41.078
I'll get it.

18:46.783 --> 18:48.049
Just keep talking.

18:48.051 --> 18:49.884
Let him wonder what
happened in there.

18:49.886 --> 18:51.752
I see you like a
little innuendo.

18:51.754 --> 18:53.420
Well not a little one.

18:53.422 --> 18:54.589
I'm gonna need
some more information

18:54.591 --> 18:56.090
about the diamond.

18:56.092 --> 18:58.091
I know a place we can talk,
and the food's survivable.

18:58.093 --> 19:00.594
Are you asking me to
lunch at a time like this?

19:00.596 --> 19:02.964
Yes, and since you're
paying me 35 a day,

19:02.966 --> 19:04.031
it's on you.

19:04.033 --> 19:05.299
Your pick.

19:05.301 --> 19:07.435
Well I do know a place
within walking distance.

19:07.437 --> 19:10.071
But, are you
familiar with Orlov?

19:10.073 --> 19:11.408
No, good food?

19:12.574 --> 19:15.609
And, then in the
1700s it was stolen.

19:15.611 --> 19:18.378
It was later passed
down to a Russian count,

19:18.380 --> 19:21.581
Gregory Orlov, and
he was a paramour

19:21.583 --> 19:24.452
of the legendary empress
Catherine the Great.

19:24.454 --> 19:27.420
He was using the diamond
to try to win her love.

19:27.422 --> 19:29.924
But no, not even with
the purest of diamonds.

19:29.926 --> 19:32.627
Who else found out
what it was worth?

19:32.629 --> 19:34.628
Well a lot of people
know what it's worth.

19:34.630 --> 19:37.031
Napoleon himself
tried to find it.

19:37.033 --> 19:39.567
But, his armies were
warned by a ghost

19:39.569 --> 19:40.834
that there would
be consequences.

19:40.836 --> 19:42.770
No, I meant who found
out what it's worth

19:42.772 --> 19:43.941
more recently?

19:45.440 --> 19:48.475
More recently there was
this pair of Russian twins

19:48.477 --> 19:52.413
who lept to their deaths
after possessing it.

19:52.415 --> 19:53.914
And, my father, he's
not the kind of man

19:53.916 --> 19:56.617
that believes in cures, but
even he was gonna have it

19:56.619 --> 19:58.852
recut, and then he disappeared.

19:58.854 --> 20:00.721
How did your
father get the diamond?

20:00.723 --> 20:01.988
I don't know.

20:01.990 --> 20:03.291
Worth a look.

20:03.293 --> 20:05.559
We can find out
how he got it here.

20:05.561 --> 20:07.528
Maybe we find out who
else knows about it.

20:07.530 --> 20:09.933
And, how soon can you pay me?

20:10.967 --> 20:11.968
Mr. Drake?

20:12.968 --> 20:14.267
Yeah.

20:14.269 --> 20:15.669
For you.

20:20.376 --> 20:22.142
Where's my tip?

20:22.144 --> 20:23.980
Eat your vegetables.

20:26.381 --> 20:28.416
What was that?

20:28.418 --> 20:30.150
Another ghost.

20:30.152 --> 20:30.984
What?

20:30.986 --> 20:32.186
Never mind.

20:32.188 --> 20:33.853
Now with a diamond
like that, it requires

20:33.855 --> 20:35.055
a big operator.

20:35.057 --> 20:36.122
It's not the kind of
thing that you can sell

20:36.124 --> 20:37.657
on the open market.

20:37.659 --> 20:39.159
I know.

20:39.161 --> 20:40.194
And, that's why I'm worried
about what's gonna happen

20:40.196 --> 20:41.561
to the rest of my family.

20:41.563 --> 20:43.230
Your father was
an archeologist,

20:43.232 --> 20:46.233
so why didn't he just
give it to a museum?

20:46.235 --> 20:48.903
Well for all I know,
he was planning on it.

20:48.905 --> 20:49.973
I don't know.

20:51.207 --> 20:53.374
He was on the board
of several museums.

20:53.376 --> 20:54.908
A diamond like
this is gonna attract

20:54.910 --> 20:56.409
the wrong kind of attention
no matter what your family

20:56.411 --> 20:58.314
tries to keep a secret.

20:59.614 --> 21:01.148
Now you mentioned
that Katherine was set

21:01.150 --> 21:03.717
to inherit all of
your family fortune.

21:03.719 --> 21:05.119
Why don't you get half?

21:07.357 --> 21:10.427
Come to dinner
tonight, you'll see.

21:12.294 --> 21:14.928
You know I didn't hurt her.

21:14.930 --> 21:16.696
You remind me of her.

21:16.698 --> 21:18.435
Well we're sisters.

21:19.835 --> 21:23.771
Look Mr. Drake, I'm not ready
to turn you in just yet,

21:23.773 --> 21:25.638
just arrive at seven.

21:25.640 --> 21:28.708
If you hear from Katherine,
will you let me know?

21:28.710 --> 21:29.976
Of course.

21:39.889 --> 21:41.355
I got it.

21:41.357 --> 21:42.923
You're broke.

21:42.925 --> 21:45.859
$1.47, still got an
eye for detail, Lew.

21:45.861 --> 21:47.093
You trained me well.

21:47.095 --> 21:48.928
We spent a lot of
years together.

21:48.930 --> 21:50.430
Who's the girl?

21:50.432 --> 21:51.965
Potential client, like
I said things are starting

21:51.967 --> 21:53.466
to pick up.

21:53.468 --> 21:55.069
Is that the girl that was
in your apartment last night?

21:55.071 --> 21:55.903
No.

21:55.905 --> 21:57.237
Busy man.

21:57.239 --> 21:58.773
Where's that one?

21:58.775 --> 22:01.111
I saw the state you were in.

22:02.611 --> 22:05.612
A needle mark in your arm,
I got a tip for you buddy.

22:05.614 --> 22:07.080
I can't cover for
you the way I did

22:07.082 --> 22:08.919
with the missing girl.

22:10.986 --> 22:12.852
And, I think someone's onto you.

22:12.854 --> 22:15.523
You didn't need
to cover for me.

22:15.525 --> 22:17.757
That was the whole problem.

22:17.759 --> 22:19.894
Just trying to help.

22:19.896 --> 22:21.028
Need any help now?

22:21.030 --> 22:22.396
Just a $1.47.

22:22.398 --> 22:24.165
Plus the tip?

22:24.167 --> 22:25.565
All in the details.

22:25.567 --> 22:29.403
Perhaps that's why
Jennifer Montemar hired you.

22:29.405 --> 22:30.905
You're a detail man.

22:36.446 --> 22:37.945
Any change, mister?

22:37.947 --> 22:39.513
I wish.

22:42.284 --> 22:43.484
That was the first time

22:43.486 --> 22:46.153
I knew you were
really onto me, Lew.

22:46.155 --> 22:47.687
So I figured the Orlov diamond

22:47.689 --> 22:50.190
was my best chance
at finding Katherine.

22:50.192 --> 22:52.725
Knowing her missing uncle
was a jeweler of course,

22:52.727 --> 22:54.230
you did the usual.

22:58.266 --> 23:00.568
I checked every
jewelry dealer in town

23:00.570 --> 23:02.570
even the ones that
didn't have a store,

23:02.572 --> 23:04.338
nothing, not even
a missing jeweler.

23:05.608 --> 23:07.107
That bothered me,
and I bothered them.

23:07.109 --> 23:09.342
And, they made not
secret about it.

23:09.344 --> 23:12.245
And, you right at my
heels, well you always knew

23:12.247 --> 23:14.016
how I felt about that.

23:15.217 --> 23:17.484
My life might have
been a slow drip,

23:17.486 --> 23:19.686
but I was definitely bleeding.

23:19.688 --> 23:23.023
And, two Montemars
walk into my office.

23:23.025 --> 23:25.559
Katherine made me
feel alive again,

23:25.561 --> 23:28.795
but Jennifer made me
want to stay that way.

23:32.267 --> 23:34.134
I arrived for dinner
at the Montemar house

23:34.136 --> 23:35.869
thinking maybe I could find out

23:35.871 --> 23:38.772
what a respectable,
normal family looked like.

23:38.774 --> 23:42.510
'Cause in my line,
I'd never met one.

23:48.918 --> 23:50.149
I'm...

23:50.151 --> 23:51.551
Roland Drake, a
private investigator

23:51.553 --> 23:54.088
of Miss Jennifer's acquaintance
who is indeed expected.

23:54.090 --> 23:55.622
Anything else?

23:55.624 --> 23:57.858
Yes, I can't say I care
very much for your shoes.

23:57.860 --> 23:59.094
Please come in.

24:16.545 --> 24:19.746
Rivers,
there's no longer steam

24:19.748 --> 24:22.249
coming off of my tea!

24:35.063 --> 24:38.098
Mr. Drake, thank you
so much for coming.

24:38.100 --> 24:39.436
Miss Montemar.

24:42.537 --> 24:44.807
Hey baby, who's the rube?

24:46.842 --> 24:49.342
Mr. Roland Drake,
please meet John Shannon.

24:49.344 --> 24:52.713
Mr. Drake has agreed to help me.

24:52.715 --> 24:55.215
Roland, I want to
thank you so much

24:55.217 --> 24:56.716
for helping my girl out.

24:56.718 --> 24:59.186
You know I just gotta
say thanks for just going

24:59.188 --> 25:00.721
out of your way for her.

25:00.723 --> 25:02.055
Yeah well not that
helping her doesn't have

25:02.057 --> 25:05.091
its own benefits,
but it is my job.

25:05.093 --> 25:06.526
What's your job?

25:06.528 --> 25:08.130
Oh I'm her fella.

25:10.632 --> 25:12.401
You're a working guy.

25:13.902 --> 25:16.235
I like helping out.

25:16.237 --> 25:19.406
I help her in, I help her
out of things for free.

25:19.408 --> 25:20.907
But, I got other hobbies.

25:22.445 --> 25:23.711
You want a bell pally?

25:23.713 --> 25:27.313
You mean a drink
or an opportunity?

25:27.315 --> 25:29.716
Both are my bag, right baby?

25:29.718 --> 25:31.351
Dinner's being served.

25:31.353 --> 25:34.754
Johnny, please do try not
to upset mother tonight.

25:34.756 --> 25:36.590
I'm pretty sure the
tin start might upset her

25:36.592 --> 25:38.391
just a little more, huh.

25:38.393 --> 25:41.462
And, I'm sorry if Johnny
appears rude, Mr. Drake.

25:41.464 --> 25:43.129
He really can be very sweet.

25:43.131 --> 25:44.231
Can't you, lover?

25:44.233 --> 25:45.068
For you.

25:47.870 --> 25:50.870
Yeah, all right, see youse.

25:50.872 --> 25:52.705
I had an ex secretary
who was real sweet.

25:52.707 --> 25:53.940
Was she?

25:53.942 --> 25:55.341
Yeah, she made
me feel real good,

25:55.343 --> 25:56.510
and when I gave her
dictation, she made me feel

25:56.512 --> 25:57.744
real smart.

25:57.746 --> 25:59.446
Oh you can be a
heel, huh Mr. Drake?

25:59.448 --> 26:00.350
I can be.

26:01.984 --> 26:03.684
Well you don't have
to make a pose of it.

26:03.686 --> 26:05.218
It's the only
pose I have left.

26:05.220 --> 26:07.487
I am gonna have to ask
your fella some questions.

26:07.489 --> 26:09.089
Of course, Johnny would
be more than happy to help

26:09.091 --> 26:10.057
any way he can.

26:10.059 --> 26:11.992
Oh I got that the first time.

26:11.994 --> 26:15.329
And, I will have to ask
your mother some questions.

26:15.331 --> 26:18.032
Well maybe not
too many questions.

26:18.034 --> 26:19.166
Really why?

26:20.636 --> 26:22.305
You'll understand.

26:23.973 --> 26:26.439
Miss Evelyn Montemar, I
present a Mr. Roland Drake,

26:26.441 --> 26:29.076
a private investigator of
Miss Jennifer's acquaintance.

26:29.078 --> 26:30.310
Please don't stand.

26:30.312 --> 26:31.246
I never do.

26:32.614 --> 26:34.848
Where's my first born
isn't Katherine joining us?

26:34.850 --> 26:37.350
There hasn't been word, madam.

26:37.352 --> 26:39.288
Well just us tonight.

26:40.555 --> 26:42.689
Katherine was quite
a dish, Mr. Drake.

26:42.691 --> 26:44.858
You know you might even
have a shot with her.

26:44.860 --> 26:46.092
Did you?

26:46.094 --> 26:47.794
No, but I got a
thing for brunettes.

26:48.831 --> 26:50.263
Charming.

26:50.265 --> 26:52.765
Evelyn quite the
spread tonight I must say

26:52.767 --> 26:53.801
like mother like daughter.

26:53.803 --> 26:54.901
You're not funny.

26:54.903 --> 26:57.236
No one thinks you're funny.

26:59.941 --> 27:01.574
Is there anything
else I can do?

27:01.576 --> 27:02.911
You do enough.

27:04.380 --> 27:06.879
He's been my strength since
your father disappeared

27:06.881 --> 27:07.717
last week.

27:09.118 --> 27:09.953
Sweet man.

27:12.254 --> 27:14.357
Private investigator, hey?

27:15.757 --> 27:17.858
Aren't you good enough
to be a police detective?

27:18.694 --> 27:19.926
Mother.

27:19.928 --> 27:22.529
No, my shoes squeak
too much ask Rivers.

27:22.531 --> 27:24.430
I don't like a man
with a sense of humor.

27:24.432 --> 27:25.866
I find it almost as unattractive

27:25.868 --> 27:28.301
as a woman with one.

27:28.303 --> 27:30.137
Depends on what
she's laughing at.

27:30.139 --> 27:34.273
I rarely laughed before my
accident, and less so now.

27:34.275 --> 27:36.176
Although I do find it
amusing that Jennifer

27:36.178 --> 27:40.015
has brought you into our
family business, why?

27:41.583 --> 27:43.015
I would like to
help your daughter.

27:43.017 --> 27:44.350
For a fee, I'm sure.

27:44.352 --> 27:46.820
Well even a shamus gotta eat.

27:46.822 --> 27:47.657
Thank you.

27:50.126 --> 27:52.426
Jennifer doesn't have
her own money, Mr. Drake.

27:52.428 --> 27:54.727
So you must be working for me.

27:54.729 --> 27:58.131
Yeah we like hard workers
around here, Mr. Drake.

27:58.133 --> 28:00.701
Yet, you're here
too Johnathan.

28:00.703 --> 28:01.935
Touche.

28:01.937 --> 28:03.236
I told Jennifer about
the newspaper stories

28:03.238 --> 28:06.005
of your disgraceful
behavior, Mr. Drake.

28:06.007 --> 28:07.241
Wait till
you see how I eat.

28:07.243 --> 28:09.009
Mother, please
you're being rude.

28:09.011 --> 28:12.111
I have a certain morbid
fascination with failing.

28:12.113 --> 28:14.782
So it was difficult to mask
my delight at meeting you.

28:14.784 --> 28:16.215
You probably noticed.

28:16.217 --> 28:18.151
No, as you and your
daughter keep pointing out,

28:18.153 --> 28:19.887
I'm not that good a detective.

28:19.889 --> 28:22.622
I'm not surprised that Jennifer
sought you out, Mr. Drake.

28:22.624 --> 28:24.824
I'm sure you're the only
detective she could recollect

28:24.826 --> 28:26.760
from my opinions of
your failings regarding

28:26.762 --> 28:28.227
that poor girl.

28:28.229 --> 28:31.430
Katherine is the
reader in this family.

28:31.432 --> 28:33.766
Just because you read
accusations in the newspaper,

28:33.768 --> 28:35.502
doesn't make 'em true.

28:35.504 --> 28:39.705
Yeah, didn't they say that
you were the best, Mr. Drake?

28:39.707 --> 28:43.676
My partner Lew would
agree with you, Johnny.

28:43.678 --> 28:45.178
Smart man.

28:45.180 --> 28:48.282
Lew MacDonald's integrity
seems quite unassailable.

28:48.284 --> 28:51.118
Frankly I'm not surprised
he left your partnership.

28:51.120 --> 28:54.288
He cuts quite a fine
figure of a man in print.

28:54.290 --> 28:57.190
Lew's always been
uncompromising when it comes

28:57.192 --> 28:58.625
to appearances.

28:59.829 --> 29:02.262
Well you seem a
little more flexible.

29:02.264 --> 29:04.731
I was down on my luck, Johnny.

29:04.733 --> 29:07.900
Why don't you take up reading,
find out what's going on?

29:07.902 --> 29:10.204
Sadly, the only thing
these two ever seem to read

29:10.206 --> 29:13.639
are the funny papers
and the obituaries.

29:13.641 --> 29:15.708
Mother, I invited
Mr. Drake here tonight

29:15.710 --> 29:17.677
because I believe that
he can do more for us

29:17.679 --> 29:19.079
than the police are doing.

29:19.081 --> 29:21.180
Wouldn't it make more
sense for you to take

29:21.182 --> 29:24.818
whatever you find to the
police instead of here to us?

29:24.820 --> 29:26.887
No more sense than
slitting my own throat

29:26.889 --> 29:28.254
to get some fresh air.

29:28.256 --> 29:30.290
I do wish Katherine were here.

29:30.292 --> 29:32.492
She would know what to do.

29:32.494 --> 29:34.328
I've often thought
that Katherine took

29:34.330 --> 29:37.397
all the refinement
from my womb and left

29:37.399 --> 29:41.467
precious little for out
fascinating Jennifer.

29:41.469 --> 29:43.035
Evelyn, Jennifer
brought me here,

29:43.037 --> 29:45.671
and I'm willing to do
what's necessary to help.

29:45.673 --> 29:47.107
Seems you've done
more than necessary

29:47.109 --> 29:48.841
as far as the police
were concerned.

29:48.843 --> 29:50.444
Perhaps, without
you that poor girl

29:50.446 --> 29:51.978
would still be alive.

29:51.980 --> 29:54.447
The girl's family
contacted me when the police

29:54.449 --> 29:56.416
appeared to be doing nothing.

29:56.418 --> 29:58.452
I found the girl, and I said so.

29:58.454 --> 29:59.686
She died.

29:59.688 --> 30:02.054
The DA and the police
made it easy to hate me

30:02.056 --> 30:04.224
and hard for me to stay
out of a permanent address

30:04.226 --> 30:05.993
with three squares and a cot.

30:05.995 --> 30:08.528
The police are doing
everything they can for us.

30:17.473 --> 30:20.577
I am beside myself
without my Wilson.

30:24.246 --> 30:28.447
All right, I have a
certain morbid curiosity.

30:28.449 --> 30:32.051
When is the last time
you saw your husband?

30:32.053 --> 30:35.187
The last time I saw Wilson
was here at home last week.

30:35.189 --> 30:36.622
When was that exactly?

30:36.624 --> 30:39.592
Tuesday 2:15, he received
a guest in his study.

30:39.594 --> 30:41.093
What was the guest's name?

30:41.095 --> 30:42.696
When Mr. Montemar
has company come

30:42.698 --> 30:44.630
to the backdoor, I've been
given specific instructions

30:44.632 --> 30:46.032
not to notice.

30:46.034 --> 30:47.704
And, his name was?

30:49.138 --> 30:53.106
The monogram on his
briefcase bore the letters GG.

30:53.108 --> 30:54.140
You did notice.

30:54.142 --> 30:55.542
Only the third visit.

30:55.544 --> 30:57.577
What happened?

30:57.579 --> 30:58.911
He visited
for 31 minutes

30:58.913 --> 31:01.682
and as per my instructions,
I have no idea

31:01.684 --> 31:04.083
about the nature
of his business.

31:04.085 --> 31:06.552
As long as
Nadia's book is missing,

31:06.554 --> 31:09.055
the operation is not safe.

31:09.057 --> 31:13.592
The diamond will never be
safer than it is with me.

31:13.594 --> 31:17.097
Well afraid we must
disagree, my friend.

31:17.099 --> 31:19.465
Nadia's death could...

31:19.467 --> 31:21.334
I'm sorry to
say I didn't see or hear

31:21.336 --> 31:23.704
any of their conversation
unfortunately.

31:23.706 --> 31:25.405
You're being coy with
me, aren't you Rivers?

31:25.407 --> 31:27.240
It hadn't occurred to me, no.

31:27.242 --> 31:30.609
The house isn't that big,
someone had to see him leave.

31:30.611 --> 31:31.447
No.

31:32.348 --> 31:33.446
Rivers?

31:33.448 --> 31:35.581
No, honestly no.

31:35.583 --> 31:39.755
All right so nobody say Wilson
or this GG leave the house?

31:40.922 --> 31:42.488
I assumed he was
delayed with business,

31:42.490 --> 31:44.724
so we ate dinner without
him which is normally beyond

31:44.726 --> 31:46.259
contemplation.

31:46.261 --> 31:49.128
I waited some time for
him, and then I had

31:49.130 --> 31:50.731
Rivers put me to bed.

31:50.733 --> 31:52.331
And, you never followed
up, and you never called

31:52.333 --> 31:53.532
the police?

31:53.534 --> 31:55.234
Later I thought I
heard them in the study.

31:55.236 --> 31:57.236
I heard voices.

31:57.238 --> 31:59.473
Wouldn't be the first time.

31:59.475 --> 32:02.975
Jennifer, we agreed how
unattractive that sense

32:02.977 --> 32:05.579
of humor is, didn't we?

32:09.752 --> 32:12.886
Jennifer, I never asked you
where you were that night.

32:14.857 --> 32:16.389
Oh you don't have to
wait for the door.

32:16.391 --> 32:19.493
You can just go ahead and
answer the question right now.

32:19.495 --> 32:21.962
I spent the entire
day with John.

32:21.964 --> 32:23.397
Yeah.

32:23.399 --> 32:24.563
Great.

32:24.565 --> 32:25.499
Yeah it was great.

32:25.501 --> 32:26.832
It was a very good day.

32:26.834 --> 32:28.100
Very great.

32:28.102 --> 32:30.003
And, then I came
home late, alone,

32:30.005 --> 32:32.472
and found out that my
father was missing.

32:32.474 --> 32:33.907
Not much of a alibi.

32:33.909 --> 32:36.309
Hey, how 'bout I pop you
right in the kisser, all right!

32:36.311 --> 32:37.476
Gentlemen!

32:37.478 --> 32:38.445
Hey I'm just trying
to keep it civil

32:38.447 --> 32:39.478
with this flat tire.

32:39.480 --> 32:40.981
What's your alibi?

32:40.983 --> 32:41.814
What?

32:41.816 --> 32:43.082
She just said it.

32:44.585 --> 32:45.819
What?

32:45.821 --> 32:47.620
You got something
in your ears, pally?

32:47.622 --> 32:49.955
Can't hear anything?

32:49.957 --> 32:51.792
What do you want me to say?

32:51.794 --> 32:53.894
We had a lovely afternoon.

32:53.896 --> 32:55.361
Yeah.

32:55.363 --> 32:57.030
We did things that a
fella does with his dame.

32:57.032 --> 32:58.865
It was a lovely afternoon.

32:58.867 --> 33:00.667
It's not your
business, all right?

33:00.669 --> 33:01.568
What'd you see?

33:01.570 --> 33:02.968
What'd you do?

33:02.970 --> 33:05.504
I saw a lot of this
lovely young lady,

33:05.506 --> 33:07.374
and you better keep
your eyes off, pal.

33:07.376 --> 33:09.509
I see what you're
doing with those eyes.

33:09.511 --> 33:11.043
This belongs to me.

33:11.045 --> 33:12.646
It's off limits.

33:12.648 --> 33:13.483
Huh?

33:14.983 --> 33:17.986
You want to ask
some more questions?

33:20.488 --> 33:22.789
Detective Barry Tate
of the Los Angeles

33:22.791 --> 33:24.357
Police Department.

33:28.663 --> 33:31.564
Please excuse
the interruption.

33:31.566 --> 33:34.667
I'm just here to ask, Drake?

33:34.669 --> 33:37.971
I hope you're here in
a non working capacity.

33:37.973 --> 33:41.241
We're birds of a
feather that way, Barry.

33:41.243 --> 33:44.744
I'm here about
Wilson Montemar.

33:44.746 --> 33:46.946
I'm Jennifer Montemar.

33:46.948 --> 33:48.814
What have you discovered?

33:48.816 --> 33:51.685
Well Miss Montemar, we
found your father's car

33:51.687 --> 33:55.288
abandoned on Hope
Street near Sixth.

33:55.290 --> 33:56.990
What about my father?

33:56.992 --> 34:00.292
Well Miss, we haven't found
him or his belongings yet.

34:00.294 --> 34:02.829
But, we did find fresh
blood in the car,

34:02.831 --> 34:06.500
and I figure with that
blood that this is becoming

34:06.502 --> 34:10.034
less and less a
missing persons case.

34:10.036 --> 34:11.637
Interesting.

34:11.639 --> 34:13.405
What is interesting?

34:13.407 --> 34:15.574
'Cause you
figured something out, Bar.

34:15.577 --> 34:18.344
I will allow you to
stay in my presence

34:18.347 --> 34:22.149
for a moment, but there's
something more important here,

34:22.150 --> 34:24.850
finding Wilson Montemar.

34:24.851 --> 34:27.887
Now there you might
have figured wrong.

34:27.889 --> 34:30.058
And, why is that, Drake?

34:31.458 --> 34:34.693
Do you care to tell the
law something for a change?

34:34.695 --> 34:36.428
I don't have my
fingers in all the pies

34:36.429 --> 34:37.898
the way you do.

34:37.900 --> 34:40.632
Well I am not
leaving this place

34:40.635 --> 34:44.771
until I have found out
everything that I need to know

34:44.773 --> 34:46.440
to help you, Evelyn.

34:50.077 --> 34:53.978
Now Evelyn, is there
something else we should be

34:53.981 --> 34:55.418
looking for here?

34:56.751 --> 35:00.553
I don't know what
you're asking of me.

35:00.555 --> 35:01.890
I believe you.

35:03.992 --> 35:08.394
Jennifer, I believe that
you are so concerned

35:08.396 --> 35:11.566
with getting back
what is yours, well,

35:13.068 --> 35:16.570
have you any idea what
your father is up to?

35:16.572 --> 35:19.939
I only know that he's
missing, and that you found

35:19.941 --> 35:21.474
his car.

35:21.476 --> 35:24.146
Well it's lucky that I'm here.

35:26.447 --> 35:31.117
Give me one reason why I
should leave you in this room,

35:31.119 --> 35:31.952
Drake?

35:31.954 --> 35:34.588
I like cooked goose,

35:34.590 --> 35:36.823
and the company's good.

35:36.825 --> 35:38.791
Maybe Katherine knows.

35:38.793 --> 35:42.030
When do I get to talk
to her in person?

35:43.965 --> 35:45.064
Oh.

35:51.006 --> 35:53.342
Katherine's not here is she?

35:55.776 --> 35:59.945
You didn't try to help
her like you helped

35:59.947 --> 36:03.983
that missing girl,
Nadia, did you Drake?

36:03.985 --> 36:06.388
You know the one that's dead.

36:07.555 --> 36:09.088
No if anyone's
gonna help a girl,

36:09.090 --> 36:12.024
you're the one to
pull the trigger.

36:12.026 --> 36:14.130
Don't mess this one up.

36:15.497 --> 36:17.097
You don't talk
with your hands.

36:17.099 --> 36:18.965
Oh I'm going to be
doing more than talking

36:18.967 --> 36:20.432
with my hands.

36:20.434 --> 36:21.635
There's ladies present.

36:21.637 --> 36:23.436
Funny last words, Drake.

36:23.438 --> 36:28.408
Detective Tate, I don't
appreciate violence in my house.

36:28.410 --> 36:30.343
Yes, thank you very much
for all of the information

36:30.345 --> 36:32.945
and please let us know if
you discover anything else.

36:32.947 --> 36:34.713
Thank you for coming.

36:34.715 --> 36:37.149
I would dissuade your
daughter from having

36:37.151 --> 36:40.755
any further contact
with Roland Drake, mam.

36:43.325 --> 36:44.427
So would I.

36:45.626 --> 36:48.463
I will be talking
to all of you.

36:51.666 --> 36:52.500
Mam.

37:00.474 --> 37:02.711
Well, that was delicious.

37:15.823 --> 37:17.392
I still need you.

38:10.412 --> 38:15.215
Although I've no sensation,
the pain is constant.

38:40.541 --> 38:43.575
Blame where there
should be love.

38:49.050 --> 38:52.352
I'm sure you mean guilt
where there should be love.

38:52.354 --> 38:56.455
Why Jennifer, I never
get such a rise out of you.

39:04.231 --> 39:06.832
Mother, I let you
berate me and berate me

39:06.834 --> 39:08.867
day after day and
night after night,

39:08.869 --> 39:10.135
but not tonight.

39:10.137 --> 39:12.604
No, you're gonna shut your trap!

39:12.606 --> 39:14.807
You don't dare
speak to me that...

39:14.809 --> 39:16.508
Yes, I do.

39:16.510 --> 39:21.414
I know a mother should never
feel what I feel for you.

39:21.416 --> 39:24.751
Rivers, I want you to
call Lew MacDonald.

39:24.753 --> 39:26.251
Get him on the telephone.

39:26.253 --> 39:27.887
Tell him I will pay him
whatever he requires of me

39:27.889 --> 39:29.588
to get to the bottom of this.

39:29.590 --> 39:30.789
Tell him!

39:30.791 --> 39:33.225
Mother, I already
have Mr. Drake.

39:33.227 --> 39:36.062
It should be
you, not me in that chair.

39:42.637 --> 39:46.238
So, like your
goose cooked, hey?

39:46.240 --> 39:48.341
It pains me as a
mother that you are

39:48.343 --> 39:50.410
such a disappointment.

39:50.412 --> 39:53.646
Well then allow me
to take away your pain.

39:53.648 --> 39:55.113
No!

39:55.115 --> 39:59.151
Beverly Hills 4044,
the Lew MacDonald Agency.

39:59.153 --> 40:00.285
What you...

40:00.287 --> 40:02.055
Hello Mr. MacDonald.

40:02.057 --> 40:03.222
<i>Paid
more attention to me</i>

40:03.224 --> 40:04.724
This is the
Montemar residence.

40:04.726 --> 40:05.959
<i>instead of
blaming me for everything.</i>

40:05.961 --> 40:07.459
Yes.

40:07.461 --> 40:08.928
We'd like to engage your
services tomorrow morning.

40:08.930 --> 40:10.329
<i>There would
be nothing to blame.</i>

40:10.331 --> 40:10.930
Oh that?

40:12.400 --> 40:14.700
That's an unseemly radio play
I have in the background.

40:14.702 --> 40:17.970
I should've turned that
down, I'm terribly sorry.

40:17.972 --> 40:21.075
So tomorrow morning
bright and early?

40:22.209 --> 40:25.780
Yes, it is a delightful
surprise, isn't it?

40:29.416 --> 40:30.249
Stop!

40:30.251 --> 40:31.117
Rivers!

40:31.119 --> 40:31.954
Stop!

40:34.990 --> 40:36.758
Here, use the pillow.

40:37.626 --> 40:40.260
It helps with her pain.

40:43.097 --> 40:43.932
Rivers.

40:48.637 --> 40:51.271
You don't have the guts.

40:54.242 --> 40:56.910
You can't leave
well enough alone, can you?

41:00.081 --> 41:02.448
You won't make
it stop doing this.

41:02.450 --> 41:05.751
I had it all wrapped
up in a neat little box.

41:07.722 --> 41:09.521
She doesn't have to be found.

41:13.294 --> 41:16.396
Yeah so, that little black
book was worth killing her,

41:16.398 --> 41:17.664
huh?

41:17.666 --> 41:19.999
No, you killing
her was worth it.

41:22.871 --> 41:27.807
I protect and serve my
city, and the profitability

41:27.809 --> 41:29.374
of our ventures.

41:32.046 --> 41:35.814
I was mad that you
didn't get the chair

41:35.816 --> 41:38.450
for murdering that
backstabbing little...

41:39.787 --> 41:41.254
whore.

41:41.256 --> 41:44.090
Well I guess you don't
control everything, do you?

41:47.963 --> 41:52.133
Oh yes, but there is one
thing I control tonight.

41:53.001 --> 41:54.503
You may disappear.

41:56.236 --> 41:58.838
That's a shame 'cause
I have the black book.

42:02.177 --> 42:03.709
Liar.

42:03.711 --> 42:05.477
You wouldn't risk it.

42:05.479 --> 42:07.983
The only one at risk is you.

42:09.249 --> 42:12.184
No one knows you're
up here with me.

42:12.186 --> 42:14.653
Now we've spent
enough time together

42:14.655 --> 42:17.992
for you to tell me
where the book is now.

42:21.496 --> 42:24.332
If not, you
eventually will beg me

42:28.570 --> 42:30.838
to throw you off this roof.

42:32.039 --> 42:33.305
You're a missing person.

42:33.307 --> 42:35.408
You always were.

42:35.410 --> 42:37.477
Nobody's gonna come and find you

42:37.479 --> 42:39.512
because nobody cares.

42:44.184 --> 42:46.318
Why don't you pull up a chair?

42:46.320 --> 42:48.053
I got a nice view.

42:48.055 --> 42:49.324
We got options.

42:51.892 --> 42:54.295
You don't have any options.

42:55.296 --> 42:57.696
You are going to disappear.

42:57.698 --> 42:59.564
Just like you did
to Katherine Montemar?

43:04.706 --> 43:06.207
I heard tonight.

43:07.675 --> 43:09.809
Let me clue you in.

43:09.811 --> 43:11.343
She's dead.

43:11.345 --> 43:12.180
Dead?

43:13.847 --> 43:15.481
You're lying.

43:15.483 --> 43:16.318
How?

43:17.519 --> 43:20.923
I ask the questions,
you give the answers.

43:22.090 --> 43:24.157
If you don't, you are going...

43:24.159 --> 43:24.994
Sir.

43:27.028 --> 43:28.928
Turn around, officer.

43:28.930 --> 43:31.164
Get back to what you were doing.

43:31.166 --> 43:32.832
It's not that, sir.

43:32.834 --> 43:34.200
You said that you didn't
want to be interrupted

43:34.202 --> 43:36.436
unless he showed up.

43:36.438 --> 43:37.271
He's here.

43:41.108 --> 43:42.110
All right.

43:45.814 --> 43:49.251
Such a nice evening,
really nice evening.

43:50.351 --> 43:52.350
You know I think
I'll give you a break

43:52.352 --> 43:54.220
until I get back.

43:54.222 --> 43:55.387
How 'bout a jaw?

44:04.566 --> 44:05.597
Stay safe.

44:21.349 --> 44:23.082
I found her.

44:23.084 --> 44:24.450
What?

44:24.452 --> 44:25.785
I found Nadia.

44:28.088 --> 44:29.722
Get out of there.

44:29.724 --> 44:31.323
What are you talking about?

44:31.325 --> 44:32.390
I found the girl.

44:32.392 --> 44:33.728
Call the police.

45:40.829 --> 45:41.662
No!

47:06.613 --> 47:09.448
This is how
we do things in my city.

47:09.450 --> 47:12.285
When things move through,
I serve and protect.

47:12.287 --> 47:15.720
I always get my cut,
my piece of everything.

47:15.722 --> 47:17.189
You can't change this.

47:17.191 --> 47:19.258
You changed it
when you killed his niece.

47:19.260 --> 47:21.093
You don't know
that I killed his niece.

47:22.162 --> 47:23.629
We know everything.

47:23.631 --> 47:25.564
That's why you work for us.

47:25.566 --> 47:28.800
I may work for
you, but this is my city.

47:28.802 --> 47:31.504
This isn't some painting
or broken piece of pottery

47:31.506 --> 47:32.905
this time.

47:32.907 --> 47:36.341
This rock is the most valuable
item we've ever moved,

47:36.343 --> 47:37.676
and I get my cut.

47:37.678 --> 47:41.479
You are, to
use the term of your

47:41.481 --> 47:44.052
own organization, on probation.

47:45.485 --> 47:48.153
They will decide when you
are part of this again.

47:48.155 --> 47:49.854
I won't
standby on this one.

47:49.856 --> 47:52.557
My forces are powerful,
and you need me.

47:52.559 --> 47:53.725
When I find this...

47:53.727 --> 47:55.528
Stay out of it.

47:55.530 --> 47:57.562
It is beyond you now.

47:57.564 --> 47:59.765
Nothing
is beyond my reach.

47:59.767 --> 48:02.233
Don't you dare
walk away from me.

48:11.579 --> 48:14.546
Find where Montemar
is, bring him to us.

48:16.050 --> 48:20.186
Make problems, and it is
you who will be exported.

48:20.188 --> 48:23.823
You think you
can come into my precinct,

48:23.825 --> 48:26.662
my office, and
tell me what to do?

48:27.996 --> 48:29.327
I am this city.

48:29.329 --> 48:31.497
This is my rule of law.

48:31.499 --> 48:34.300
If you want to live,
don't ever tell me

48:34.302 --> 48:35.667
what to do again.

48:36.903 --> 48:37.736
You...

49:37.564 --> 49:41.168
Mathews, another
suspect tried to escape.

49:42.003 --> 49:43.604
Clean this mess up.

49:54.048 --> 49:56.481
I want everyone of our
men looking for Drake.

49:56.483 --> 49:58.586
He's still got that book.

50:07.628 --> 50:09.095
Nadia had a book.

50:09.097 --> 50:11.363
Black with the dark
afterglow confessions

50:11.365 --> 50:13.532
written in her own code.

50:13.534 --> 50:16.001
Her words up till then
were the only safe

50:16.003 --> 50:18.204
I could never crack.

50:18.206 --> 50:20.673
Police corruption,
Wilson's own name,

50:20.675 --> 50:22.441
and the priceless
things moving through

50:22.443 --> 50:24.910
the deepest arteries
of the city unseen

50:24.912 --> 50:27.245
all found new meaning
in the diamond

50:27.247 --> 50:31.186
as it flawlessly destroyed
the Montemar family.

50:32.686 --> 50:35.053
The black book wasn't
just an insurance policy

50:35.055 --> 50:38.557
anymore, it was a chance
to set it all right.

50:38.559 --> 50:39.925
You had it?

50:39.927 --> 50:41.861
Of course, well played.

50:41.863 --> 50:42.964
Where was it?

50:44.231 --> 50:45.300
Just curious.

50:46.700 --> 50:50.572
Fine, so that's why no one would
really testify against you.

50:54.207 --> 50:56.008
Very well played.

50:56.010 --> 50:57.575
A lot of names in that book.

50:57.577 --> 51:01.379
If anything happened to
me, I made provisions.

51:18.331 --> 51:19.965
Geez
Drake, this place

51:19.967 --> 51:22.137
is a Petrie dish of germs.

51:31.878 --> 51:33.111
Dispatch.

51:33.113 --> 51:36.048
Tate, I want an all
points bulletin put out

51:36.050 --> 51:37.383
on Roland Drake.

51:37.385 --> 51:38.517
What's
the charge, sir?

51:38.519 --> 51:39.621
The charge?

51:41.189 --> 51:42.357
I found blood.

51:43.990 --> 51:46.258
I'll come up with something.

51:46.260 --> 51:47.459
Yes sir.

52:35.075 --> 52:37.575
Move over
Jennifer, I'll drive.

52:48.622 --> 52:51.126
So Wilson seems to be missing.

52:54.729 --> 52:59.430
I know, and I'm really
worried about my father.

52:59.432 --> 53:03.103
Montemars always know
more than they tell.

53:05.305 --> 53:07.708
He and I were working a deal.

53:10.410 --> 53:14.582
I know you have a precious
little item.

53:20.488 --> 53:22.724
Are we driving someplace?

53:24.224 --> 53:26.758
Even with him gone, it
doesn't mean you and I

53:26.760 --> 53:28.459
can't be in bed together.

53:28.461 --> 53:31.298
We've always been
close, Jennifer.

53:33.968 --> 53:36.635
Never with my consent.

53:36.637 --> 53:38.537
Now let's do
this deal together,

53:38.539 --> 53:41.205
and then you and I
can go somewhere new,

53:41.207 --> 53:44.410
a cottage in the woods,
neighbors miles away

53:44.412 --> 53:46.512
visit only occasionally.

53:46.514 --> 53:50.684
They smile at us and pat
our children on the head,

53:52.153 --> 53:53.321
never knowing.

53:55.622 --> 53:57.791
You have to give it to me.

53:58.726 --> 54:00.227
Give it to me now!

54:19.146 --> 54:20.745
What happened to you?

54:20.747 --> 54:24.615
So after dinner, I was
peeking in your mom's bedroom.

54:24.617 --> 54:26.151
And?

54:26.153 --> 54:27.419
I fell.

54:27.421 --> 54:29.354
Tate caught me.

54:29.356 --> 54:31.155
I wish I hit the ground.

54:59.119 --> 55:02.222
So what are we
gonna do about John?

55:21.541 --> 55:22.376
Mother?

55:24.244 --> 55:27.178
Rivers you've been my
strength since my Wilson

55:27.180 --> 55:28.646
disappeared?

55:28.648 --> 55:30.417
You're so good to me.

55:31.251 --> 55:32.353
I don't tell.

55:35.389 --> 55:36.854
This is getting weird.

55:36.856 --> 55:39.658
Things are making so
much sense right now.

55:39.660 --> 55:42.361
I'm glad they are for you.

55:42.363 --> 55:45.497
Oh my God, why
are you doing this?

55:45.499 --> 55:46.365
Why?

55:50.037 --> 55:53.539
Rivers, you
handsome, handsome man.

55:53.541 --> 55:56.311
Wait till they
find out I'm dead.

56:00.613 --> 56:01.448
Mom.

56:07.121 --> 56:08.722
Is she really dead?

56:25.305 --> 56:29.374
Please comb my hair
before the police arrive.

56:29.376 --> 56:31.379
The police can't come.

56:36.916 --> 56:39.117
That would be a
Mr. John Shannon

56:39.119 --> 56:42.122
arriving
uncharacteristically early.

56:45.124 --> 56:48.195
Johnny hi, I'm so
glad you're here.

56:51.698 --> 56:53.164
Drake, what are
you doing here?

56:53.166 --> 56:55.901
I'm just here to check
out her father's study.

56:55.903 --> 56:58.870
Oh no, that room's been
gone over many times.

56:58.872 --> 57:00.104
Don't bother.

57:00.106 --> 57:02.106
Well do you mind if
I earn my 45 a day?

57:02.108 --> 57:03.709
35 a day.

57:03.711 --> 57:05.443
You look like you
could use a beer.

57:05.445 --> 57:06.644
You know I could use one.

57:06.646 --> 57:07.579
A little early.

57:07.581 --> 57:09.150
It's late for me.

57:10.584 --> 57:12.917
You got all the
sides covered don't you?

57:12.919 --> 57:14.051
Excuse me?

57:14.053 --> 57:16.254
You and me in the bedroom.

57:16.256 --> 57:18.289
That was real.

57:18.291 --> 57:19.658
And, what's this?

57:19.660 --> 57:21.827
This was covering our bases.

57:21.829 --> 57:23.662
Don't do me any favors.

57:23.664 --> 57:25.329
Are you crazy?

57:25.331 --> 57:27.666
All of that had to
happen in front of you.

57:27.668 --> 57:29.401
Don't question my feelings.

57:29.403 --> 57:30.869
It's a simple mistake.

57:30.871 --> 57:34.106
You show me some affection,
and I go and believe it.

57:34.108 --> 57:38.278
You know you might actually
like how this turns out.

57:41.314 --> 57:43.414
My father's study's
down the hallway.

57:43.416 --> 57:45.085
I'll meet you there.

57:46.019 --> 57:47.354
Do you trust me?

57:49.456 --> 57:50.791
Do you trust me?

58:03.637 --> 58:04.570
John.

58:04.572 --> 58:05.937
What is he doing here?

58:05.939 --> 58:07.606
Was he here all night?

58:07.608 --> 58:09.173
Why are you in your nightgown?

58:09.175 --> 58:10.207
Was he in your bedroom?

58:10.209 --> 58:11.577
What does he know?

58:11.579 --> 58:13.378
Calm down.

58:13.380 --> 58:14.782
We will find out.

58:16.015 --> 58:17.950
Now about Drake.

58:17.952 --> 58:20.084
Oh yeah, shush.

58:20.086 --> 58:22.019
We'll find out what
he knows together.

58:22.021 --> 58:23.220
Yes.

58:23.222 --> 58:24.722
Do you honestly think
he knows something

58:24.724 --> 58:26.393
he's not telling us?

58:28.329 --> 58:29.695
I got an idea.

58:37.671 --> 58:39.805
Johnny, you're
kidding right tough guy?

58:39.807 --> 58:41.205
I don't like Johnny.

58:41.207 --> 58:42.673
Neither do I.

58:42.675 --> 58:44.142
Much as I don't want
to, I'll have to hurt her

58:44.144 --> 58:45.276
if you don't talk.

58:45.278 --> 58:46.445
You're all heart.

58:46.447 --> 58:47.678
We're gonna talk about you,

58:47.680 --> 58:49.080
we're gonna talk about
that Orlov diamond.

58:49.082 --> 58:51.182
I think you know more
than you're letting on.

58:51.184 --> 58:52.651
You need to stop that.

58:52.653 --> 58:53.484
What?

58:53.486 --> 58:54.986
Thinking.

58:54.988 --> 58:57.856
I love Jennifer, and
I won't let you ruin it!

58:57.858 --> 59:00.725
You're good for her,
oh I can see that.

59:00.727 --> 59:02.928
If you care anything
about her whatsoever,

59:02.930 --> 59:05.097
you're gonna tell me what
you know about that diamond.

59:05.099 --> 59:08.600
I can't tell you
where the diamond is.

59:08.602 --> 59:09.434
Wrong.

59:14.307 --> 59:16.707
Look you're jealous,
I get it Drake,

59:16.709 --> 59:19.611
but let's make things real
spiffy and tell the whole story.

59:19.613 --> 59:20.711
You first.

59:20.713 --> 59:21.946
What whole story, Johnny?

59:21.948 --> 59:23.280
What whole story?

59:23.282 --> 59:25.684
Oh, I got him interested now.

59:25.686 --> 59:27.885
Wilson, he's not missing.

59:27.887 --> 59:29.854
I know he's dead.

59:29.856 --> 59:30.856
That's right eagle eye.

59:30.858 --> 59:31.689
He's dead.

59:32.526 --> 59:34.693
Wait a minute, how did?

59:34.695 --> 59:36.794
No one's seen
him for seven days.

59:36.796 --> 59:39.430
There is no body, so no
one's gonna squat hot for it.

59:39.432 --> 59:41.265
In fact the file in
Tate's office said

59:41.267 --> 59:43.869
no one contacted the
police or the family

59:43.871 --> 59:46.238
for ransom which can
only mean one thing.

59:46.240 --> 59:48.840
Despite all appearances,
the Montemar family

59:48.842 --> 59:50.608
has no money.

59:50.610 --> 59:51.843
They don't?

59:51.845 --> 59:53.245
No, of course.

59:53.247 --> 59:55.180
That's why the diamond
is so important.

59:55.182 --> 59:57.182
Anyone who sells that
diamond on the black market

59:57.184 --> 59:59.316
would be set for life.

59:59.318 --> 01:00:00.751
How do you know this?

01:00:00.753 --> 01:00:02.454
My father never told me.

01:00:02.456 --> 01:00:04.321
Obviously he wouldn't
tell you because that

01:00:04.323 --> 01:00:08.526
would tie him to the Russian
mod and to illegal trafficking.

01:00:08.528 --> 01:00:10.028
How do I know it?

01:00:10.030 --> 01:00:14.466
Well he told it to someone
else in bed months ago.

01:00:14.468 --> 01:00:17.669
And, a girl named
Nadia wrote it down.

01:00:17.671 --> 01:00:19.470
It didn't make
sense until today.

01:00:37.624 --> 01:00:39.557
All this time they've
been looking for Wilson,

01:00:39.559 --> 01:00:41.459
we've been looking
for the diamond.

01:00:41.461 --> 01:00:42.394
We?

01:00:42.396 --> 01:00:44.396
Oh yeah, that's the best part.

01:00:44.398 --> 01:00:47.466
You're gonna die, and
there won't be no murder

01:00:47.468 --> 01:00:48.666
'cause they won't find no body

01:00:48.668 --> 01:00:49.767
because we always...

01:00:49.769 --> 01:00:52.037
Who's we, Johnny?

01:00:52.039 --> 01:00:52.870
You know.

01:00:52.872 --> 01:00:53.704
Who's we?

01:00:53.706 --> 01:00:54.539
Wait just wait.

01:00:54.541 --> 01:00:55.372
Who is we?

01:00:55.374 --> 01:00:56.207
You better tell me.

01:00:56.209 --> 01:00:57.041
That's it Jennifer.

01:00:57.043 --> 01:00:58.343
You're crazy.

01:00:58.345 --> 01:00:59.811
You wanna know who
killed him, Drake?

01:00:59.813 --> 01:01:02.079
Gun's not loaded, Roland.

01:01:02.081 --> 01:01:04.048
What, you little bitch,
what are you doing?

01:01:21.367 --> 01:01:22.636
Son of a bitch.

01:01:29.075 --> 01:01:31.041
It
was the first and last time

01:01:31.043 --> 01:01:33.477
Johnny ever touched a book.

01:01:55.035 --> 01:01:55.870
Drake!

01:02:00.106 --> 01:02:02.776
Oh I'll have to clean that up.

01:02:06.046 --> 01:02:07.215
Go.

01:02:12.952 --> 01:02:14.820
That was exciting.

01:02:14.822 --> 01:02:16.320
With you it usually is.

01:02:16.322 --> 01:02:17.588
I would never in my life.

01:02:17.590 --> 01:02:20.225
I mean I have seen some,
heard some crazy things

01:02:20.227 --> 01:02:21.158
in my life.

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:23.563
But, that was almost arousing.

01:02:25.698 --> 01:02:26.800
Is that okay?

01:02:30.236 --> 01:02:31.572
Oh my gosh, wow.

01:02:34.675 --> 01:02:35.776
That was wow.

01:02:40.814 --> 01:02:43.113
He wants
to kill us I think.

01:02:51.457 --> 01:02:53.024
Drake.

01:03:27.059 --> 01:03:30.794
I swear I'm not trying
to be presumptuous,

01:03:30.796 --> 01:03:34.064
but I honestly feel that
a motel is our best bet.

01:03:34.066 --> 01:03:37.936
Oh you're not being
presumptuous, not at all.

01:03:46.445 --> 01:03:49.213
It felt
right to be there nest to her.

01:03:49.215 --> 01:03:52.651
With her sister, it had
been lust, a challenge.

01:03:52.653 --> 01:03:55.854
But, with Jennifer,
even how her body moved

01:03:55.856 --> 01:03:58.856
in such an unconsciously
alluring manner, melted me

01:03:58.858 --> 01:04:01.695
in a way I didn't
have a name for.

01:04:05.231 --> 01:04:07.567
Planning another invasion?

01:04:08.834 --> 01:04:12.673
Well actually I was
kind of hoping you were.

01:04:25.184 --> 01:04:26.519
How about India?

01:04:32.224 --> 01:04:35.727
Katherine always
wanted to go to India

01:04:35.729 --> 01:04:38.232
if she even knows where it is.

01:04:39.967 --> 01:04:43.934
Just say anything to
get out of that house.

01:04:43.936 --> 01:04:48.108
Jennifer if there's ever
gonna be an us anywhere,

01:04:49.041 --> 01:04:51.242
you need to know everything.

01:04:51.244 --> 01:04:52.209
Is there an us?

01:04:52.211 --> 01:04:53.380
Isn't there?

01:04:55.282 --> 01:04:58.619
I woke up that day,
and there was blood.

01:05:02.488 --> 01:05:06.423
And, I don't know what happened,
or why I didn't wake up.

01:05:06.425 --> 01:05:08.094
Maybe I was drugged.

01:05:09.528 --> 01:05:13.367
But, I opened my eyes
and there was the blood,

01:05:14.901 --> 01:05:16.637
her blood everywhere.

01:05:19.939 --> 01:05:22.374
You have to believe me.

01:05:22.376 --> 01:05:23.444
Not hurt her.

01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:28.581
It kills me that I
haven't solved the crime.

01:05:30.249 --> 01:05:32.986
And, then you
walked into my life

01:05:37.423 --> 01:05:38.992
and things got all.

01:06:01.548 --> 01:06:03.217
Nadia's death has,

01:06:06.586 --> 01:06:09.756
forgive me Wilson
how do you say this,

01:06:10.823 --> 01:06:12.226
changed the game.

01:06:16.028 --> 01:06:19.733
And, your exorbitant
bet and continued excess

01:06:22.001 --> 01:06:23.837
will bury your family.

01:06:42.756 --> 01:06:45.192
So now you know we're poor.

01:06:46.927 --> 01:06:49.093
Did he give you the diamond?

01:06:49.095 --> 01:06:52.097
No, you'll never
get it from me.

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:57.202
Okay as discussed,
we'll beat it out of him.

01:07:02.142 --> 01:07:04.508
Where is the diamond?

01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:05.742
Where is it?

01:07:09.682 --> 01:07:13.387
All the love I have
for you is in that safe.

01:07:21.227 --> 01:07:22.329
It's empty.

01:07:29.568 --> 01:07:31.568
Take care of the body.

01:08:25.125 --> 01:08:26.957
My
dear, I cannot sleep.

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.392
I have to go back to the house.

01:08:28.394 --> 01:08:31.562
We need money, and I know where
my father has some hidden.

01:08:31.564 --> 01:08:33.462
As much as you might
disagree, I cannot spend

01:08:33.465 --> 01:08:36.133
the rest of my time
in this negligee.

01:08:36.135 --> 01:08:40.206
I hope I'll be back before
you even read this, J.

01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:49.415
I need a cab.

01:08:50.783 --> 01:08:51.916
So I followed her.

01:08:51.917 --> 01:08:53.350
I was thinking
clearly enough to know

01:08:53.353 --> 01:08:56.720
that after having her, I
wouldn't be thinking clearly.

01:08:56.723 --> 01:08:59.957
You never let yourself fall
for a dame in our business

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:01.892
let alone two in one week.

01:09:01.894 --> 01:09:05.863
Sisters,
naughty, naughty, naughty.

01:09:05.865 --> 01:09:07.832
Bad for business.

01:09:07.834 --> 01:09:10.568
I didn't follow her
because I didn't trust her.

01:09:10.569 --> 01:09:12.868
I followed her because I had to.

01:09:12.871 --> 01:09:15.372
She left a trail
of all my hopes.

01:09:15.375 --> 01:09:17.645
Like crumbs in the forest.

01:09:18.577 --> 01:09:20.144
Why is it so important?

01:09:20.145 --> 01:09:22.779
Who cares about what's in
her little black book anyway?

01:09:23.649 --> 01:09:25.115
You should care.

01:09:25.117 --> 01:09:26.883
I'm in her little black book.

01:09:26.885 --> 01:09:29.419
He is in her little
black book, and you

01:09:29.421 --> 01:09:31.756
are in her little
black book too.

01:09:31.758 --> 01:09:34.926
Tonight we are going
to go and relieve Drake

01:09:34.928 --> 01:09:39.062
of his little get out
of jail free card.

01:09:39.064 --> 01:09:43.568
Now fortunately, we
found blood in his house.

01:09:43.569 --> 01:09:46.907
We have a proper
warrant for his office.

01:09:51.678 --> 01:09:54.712
Operator, get me
the reporter's desk

01:09:54.714 --> 01:09:56.550
at the Harold Express.

01:10:08.394 --> 01:10:09.660
Let's wait.

01:10:27.046 --> 01:10:28.680
Eyes on the road.

01:10:36.156 --> 01:10:37.925
Katherine, son of a...

01:10:38.857 --> 01:10:41.191
Does she take it all off, huh?

01:10:51.870 --> 01:10:52.705
Drive.

01:11:22.201 --> 01:11:24.534
Boy, that was close.

01:11:24.536 --> 01:11:25.970
You think.

01:11:33.979 --> 01:11:35.747
You want me to wait?

01:11:35.749 --> 01:11:38.483
Does this look like
my final destination?

01:11:38.485 --> 01:11:40.251
That's sarcasm, right?

01:11:40.253 --> 01:11:41.118
No.

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:41.953
Really?

01:11:41.955 --> 01:11:43.624
Yes, it's sarcasm.

01:11:45.892 --> 01:11:48.458
Flash me if we find we're
not alone, all right?

01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:50.660
Do you want me to
blow the horn too?

01:11:50.662 --> 01:11:52.499
There goes your tip.

01:11:54.534 --> 01:11:56.937
I'll keep the fare running.

01:12:57.464 --> 01:12:58.298
Dig.

01:13:57.523 --> 01:14:00.190
Everything okay, Bert?

01:14:00.192 --> 01:14:02.894
Yeah, waiting on a fare.

01:14:10.803 --> 01:14:14.271
Well good luck
with that, Bert.

01:14:14.273 --> 01:14:18.476
Listen we got an APB on
this guy, Roland Drake.

01:14:18.478 --> 01:14:19.310
You seen him?

01:14:20.146 --> 01:14:21.044
Nope.

01:14:21.046 --> 01:14:21.881
No.

01:14:52.545 --> 01:14:54.811
We need to get back to
the house I was casing.

01:14:54.813 --> 01:14:57.248
Listen Drake, I don't
want to get you turned in,

01:14:57.250 --> 01:14:59.984
but I also don't want to be an
accomplice to your peepshow.

01:14:59.986 --> 01:15:01.552
Why don't I take you
back to that motel,

01:15:01.554 --> 01:15:03.421
and we'll call it even?

01:15:03.423 --> 01:15:04.258
No.

01:15:49.902 --> 01:15:53.173
Mr. Claude Allen,
I asked a question.

01:15:55.441 --> 01:15:56.777
You will answer.

01:16:02.682 --> 01:16:04.148
Drake's a good man, detective.

01:16:04.150 --> 01:16:05.783
I think you railroaded him.

01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:10.323
You will do what I say.

01:16:20.032 --> 01:16:21.699
Arrest them!

01:16:21.701 --> 01:16:23.804
We didn't see anything.

01:16:24.903 --> 01:16:27.203
You want us to
arrest the reporters?

01:16:27.205 --> 01:16:28.038
My family.

01:16:40.452 --> 01:16:42.686
Extra, extra,
read all about it.

01:16:42.688 --> 01:16:44.821
Hey Mr. Drake, up early?

01:16:44.823 --> 01:16:46.390
Late.

01:16:46.392 --> 01:16:48.426
How 'bout a newspaper Scotty.

01:16:48.428 --> 01:16:50.560
Sure thing, lots of bad news.

01:16:50.562 --> 01:16:53.129
It should be a good morning.

01:16:53.131 --> 01:16:56.637
The DA guy who was
after you got his, huh?

01:16:59.138 --> 01:17:01.238
I guess there is justice.

01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:02.739
Well I wouldn't
want to be caught dead

01:17:02.741 --> 01:17:04.240
at his funeral.

01:17:19.058 --> 01:17:21.124
I got
back just ahead of her, Lew.

01:17:21.126 --> 01:17:23.327
My whole world had changed
knowing Katherine was

01:17:23.329 --> 01:17:24.794
still in it.

01:17:24.796 --> 01:17:26.730
I knew that my feelings
for Jennifer were deepening

01:17:26.732 --> 01:17:28.899
clouding everything
including the job

01:17:28.901 --> 01:17:30.671
she'd hired me to do.

01:17:31.970 --> 01:17:33.002
Okay.

01:17:33.004 --> 01:17:34.637
Oh good, you got my note.

01:17:34.639 --> 01:17:35.976
We need to talk.

01:17:37.677 --> 01:17:39.342
Oh yeah, we do.

01:17:39.344 --> 01:17:40.810
Okay let me talk first.

01:17:40.812 --> 01:17:44.047
So I went back to the
house, packed our bags.

01:17:44.049 --> 01:17:46.652
Then I went to check on Johnny.

01:17:48.054 --> 01:17:49.386
Roland, he wasn't there.

01:17:49.388 --> 01:17:50.654
His body wasn't there.

01:17:50.656 --> 01:17:54.057
There was no body, and
I searched that house.

01:17:54.059 --> 01:17:56.593
And, there was no body.

01:17:56.595 --> 01:17:58.162
And, it scared the
heck out of me,

01:17:58.164 --> 01:18:00.463
so I got our stuff
and I came here.

01:18:00.465 --> 01:18:03.637
I got out of there
as fast as I could.

01:18:05.237 --> 01:18:08.040
Who do you think
moved the body?

01:18:10.209 --> 01:18:11.675
Why are you looking
at me like that?

01:18:11.677 --> 01:18:13.944
Who do you think moved the body?

01:18:13.946 --> 01:18:15.948
Time for a confession.

01:18:18.351 --> 01:18:20.684
Roland, I don't
even know what...

01:18:20.686 --> 01:18:22.755
I followed you tonight.

01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:24.825
Why?

01:18:26.893 --> 01:18:29.563
Katherine moved Johnny's body.

01:18:30.463 --> 01:18:31.294
What?

01:18:31.296 --> 01:18:32.829
Katherine.

01:18:32.831 --> 01:18:34.030
You're sitting here
trying to tell me

01:18:34.032 --> 01:18:35.231
she's still alive?

01:18:35.233 --> 01:18:37.700
Look I know that
you love your sister.

01:18:37.702 --> 01:18:38.968
So she's still alive?

01:18:38.970 --> 01:18:40.604
Yeah, but you need
to consider the fact

01:18:40.606 --> 01:18:42.506
that she might be
behind all of this.

01:18:42.508 --> 01:18:44.608
She faked her own disappearance.

01:18:44.610 --> 01:18:46.577
This is the genius
of this whole thing.

01:18:46.579 --> 01:18:50.748
She's taking bodies and
burying them in open graves.

01:18:50.750 --> 01:18:52.252
No body, no crime.

01:18:53.419 --> 01:18:55.118
Either that or she's
trying to protect me

01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:57.087
because that's what she's
done her entire life, Roland.

01:18:57.089 --> 01:18:58.692
You don't know her.

01:19:00.259 --> 01:19:04.427
Rivers, he told you about
some guy with the initials GG

01:19:04.429 --> 01:19:05.729
when we were at dinner.

01:19:05.731 --> 01:19:09.432
So if GG is so important
to keep secret,

01:19:09.434 --> 01:19:11.435
maybe we should
be looking for GG.

01:19:11.437 --> 01:19:14.841
That would be my
next course of action.

01:19:16.008 --> 01:19:18.475
It's unmarked except for GG.

01:19:18.477 --> 01:19:20.077
Unmarked mail's the best.

01:19:20.079 --> 01:19:22.346
Those are the ones who
don't want to be found.

01:19:22.348 --> 01:19:24.547
The man that attacked
us in my office,

01:19:24.549 --> 01:19:27.418
he had a matchbook from here.

01:19:39.898 --> 01:19:41.097
There you go.

01:19:41.099 --> 01:19:42.399
Take good care
of it for you, sir.

01:19:42.401 --> 01:19:44.668
Don't worry, it's not ours.

01:19:53.946 --> 01:19:55.879
Is Clark Gable staying here?

01:19:55.881 --> 01:19:59.816
Sir, Clark Gable has not
checked into our establishment.

01:19:59.818 --> 01:20:01.651
How 'bout William Powell?

01:20:01.653 --> 01:20:04.888
Not the William Powell,
but a William Powell.

01:20:04.890 --> 01:20:09.659
We may have a celebrity
or celebrities staying here.

01:20:09.661 --> 01:20:12.061
Alas, if only you
knew their name,

01:20:12.063 --> 01:20:14.398
then I could find him for you.

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:17.501
Shall I call security and
show you the front door.

01:20:17.503 --> 01:20:19.302
Nah, we saw it on the way in.

01:20:29.381 --> 01:20:32.552
You know that five
spot you gave me?

01:20:33.952 --> 01:20:37.754
Well someone just
arrived in your car.

01:20:37.756 --> 01:20:39.690
Three, two, one, the
receptionist's finger

01:20:39.692 --> 01:20:41.057
hesitated on one name.

01:20:41.059 --> 01:20:43.360
Receptionist's fingers
always hesitate

01:20:43.362 --> 01:20:46.430
on the one name they
don't want to reveal.

01:20:50.635 --> 01:20:53.874
Two of them, they're
on their way up.

01:20:56.008 --> 01:21:00.144
No idea, but they thought
they were very clever.

01:21:00.146 --> 01:21:02.715
320, 321, wow you were right.

01:21:04.549 --> 01:21:06.083
This is not your room.

01:21:06.085 --> 01:21:09.052
Well that's a relief
because you look like you hog

01:21:09.054 --> 01:21:10.020
the sheets.

01:21:10.022 --> 01:21:12.422
We are here to see Mr. GG.

01:21:12.424 --> 01:21:13.257
Mr. GG?

01:21:13.259 --> 01:21:14.525
Yes.

01:21:14.527 --> 01:21:16.993
I'm sorry Mr. GG
does not see anyone

01:21:16.995 --> 01:21:19.430
without an invitation.

01:21:19.432 --> 01:21:22.202
I got an invitation
right here.

01:21:25.603 --> 01:21:27.236
Good luck.

01:21:33.179 --> 01:21:34.011
Hi.

01:21:34.013 --> 01:21:34.848
Whoa.

01:21:39.451 --> 01:21:40.883
Jennifer.

01:21:40.885 --> 01:21:44.288
I must say I am very,
very sorry of the events

01:21:44.290 --> 01:21:46.890
of the Montemar
household have been

01:21:46.892 --> 01:21:49.760
so deeply distressing for you.

01:21:49.762 --> 01:21:53.933
And, the infamous Mr. Drake
scourge of the police.

01:21:59.205 --> 01:22:03.376
I am Gavron Grozney a friend
of the family you could say.

01:22:05.411 --> 01:22:08.481
Let's talk about
the Orlov diamond.

01:22:10.415 --> 01:22:13.950
So now you and Miss
Montemar find yourselves

01:22:13.952 --> 01:22:17.189
in quite an uncomfortable
position, no?

01:22:18.223 --> 01:22:20.190
Really what would that be?

01:22:20.192 --> 01:22:24.363
Everyone who comes in
contact with the diamond dies.

01:22:25.363 --> 01:22:27.701
You're in contact with it.

01:22:29.501 --> 01:22:33.069
You are not a
villain, Mr. Drake.

01:22:33.071 --> 01:22:35.739
The whole city has
tried to make you to be

01:22:35.741 --> 01:22:39.912
such a person, but try as you
might, I know you are not.

01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:52.388
The missing Russian girl,
Nadia, she was my niece.

01:22:52.390 --> 01:22:56.627
Wait, you're the GG that's
all over her black book?

01:22:56.629 --> 01:22:58.694
Not in the customer section,
but you're the busy man

01:22:58.696 --> 01:23:00.366
she admired so much?

01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:06.569
Information is the
currency of our business,

01:23:06.571 --> 01:23:07.406
it's true.

01:23:09.008 --> 01:23:10.908
You do not rise to become
the head of the Russian

01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:12.876
black market without
knowing the value

01:23:12.878 --> 01:23:16.446
of having crippling
information about the corrupt

01:23:16.448 --> 01:23:18.617
and inelegant police force.

01:23:20.585 --> 01:23:23.352
The pitifulness of
their own corruption

01:23:23.354 --> 01:23:26.692
makes them vulnerable
to my temptations.

01:23:30.763 --> 01:23:34.330
Was my father's diamond
one of your temptations?

01:23:34.332 --> 01:23:35.168
Perhaps.

01:23:36.602 --> 01:23:38.101
But, if you have come for
your father's diamond,

01:23:38.103 --> 01:23:41.437
you have come
woefully unprepared.

01:23:41.439 --> 01:23:45.409
In fact, I am insulted
that you have come to me

01:23:45.411 --> 01:23:47.981
bringing nothing but this girl.

01:23:59.825 --> 01:24:01.824
Ow, you stop!

01:24:01.826 --> 01:24:02.860
You stop that.

01:24:02.862 --> 01:24:03.793
You are woman.

01:24:03.795 --> 01:24:05.128
And, you stop hitting me.

01:24:11.804 --> 01:24:13.436
Yeah,
but that's my girl.

01:24:13.438 --> 01:24:14.904
And now you
seem to find yourself

01:24:14.906 --> 01:24:16.907
in a most
uncomfortable position.

01:24:20.745 --> 01:24:23.547
Miss Montemar, I
am very impressed.

01:24:23.549 --> 01:24:25.047
I'm very impressed.

01:24:25.049 --> 01:24:28.552
I can see why Mr. Drake
is so anxious to claim you

01:24:28.554 --> 01:24:30.453
for his very own.

01:24:30.455 --> 01:24:31.687
Do you have it?

01:24:31.689 --> 01:24:34.591
Indeed comrade,
it is close by.

01:24:34.593 --> 01:24:35.792
Then give it to me.

01:24:35.794 --> 01:24:36.827
No.

01:24:36.829 --> 01:24:40.062
Be careful, they might shoot.

01:24:40.064 --> 01:24:42.134
This is very frightening.

01:24:43.302 --> 01:24:46.602
It is close by, but
not within reach.

01:24:46.604 --> 01:24:48.374
Then reach further.

01:24:51.110 --> 01:24:56.046
It is where every item
of great value in antiquity

01:24:56.048 --> 01:24:59.719
should be, but it is
however not on display.

01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:03.819
I'm not prepared to say more.

01:25:03.821 --> 01:25:04.922
You don't need to.

01:25:04.924 --> 01:25:06.722
A place with
antiquities, a museum.

01:25:06.724 --> 01:25:08.992
Not on display, it's
just waiting to be sold

01:25:08.994 --> 01:25:10.427
on the black market.

01:25:10.429 --> 01:25:12.095
You are on a fool's errand.

01:25:12.097 --> 01:25:15.101
My temptations
reach far and wide.

01:25:16.235 --> 01:25:19.101
You are an honorable
man, Mr. Drake.

01:25:19.103 --> 01:25:23.140
And, I meet so few of
them in this business,

01:25:23.142 --> 01:25:26.579
but with her, I suspect
it will always be

01:25:27.713 --> 01:25:29.381
unfinished business.

01:25:30.348 --> 01:25:33.350
Yeah, that's our problem.

01:25:33.352 --> 01:25:36.022
Sadly, one of many I'm afraid.

01:25:36.955 --> 01:25:38.120
Listen to me.

01:25:38.122 --> 01:25:39.623
Leave this place.

01:25:39.625 --> 01:25:41.291
Leave this place,
leave the diamond,

01:25:41.293 --> 01:25:43.694
leave the underbelly
of your pasts behind

01:25:43.696 --> 01:25:46.797
and start again together
while you still can.

01:25:46.799 --> 01:25:49.533
You two are very good together.

01:25:49.535 --> 01:25:50.833
I came here for the diamond.

01:25:50.835 --> 01:25:52.405
I want what's mine.

01:25:55.073 --> 01:25:57.410
No matter who it destroys?

01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:03.579
Our
papers are being forced

01:26:03.581 --> 01:26:05.949
to publish pictures of you

01:26:05.951 --> 01:26:09.052
as you've seen fit to
draw us into the light

01:26:09.054 --> 01:26:13.390
and have jeopardized our
largest transaction to date,

01:26:13.392 --> 01:26:17.427
we have decided you are
permanently out any further

01:26:17.429 --> 01:26:19.229
business arrangements.

01:26:19.231 --> 01:26:23.402
To use the parlance of
chess, you are a pawn Tate.

01:26:24.370 --> 01:26:26.302
You were always a pawn.

01:26:26.304 --> 01:26:29.709
And, you're being
removed from the board.

01:26:33.946 --> 01:26:34.781
A pawn?

01:26:37.215 --> 01:26:38.050
Me?

01:26:40.419 --> 01:26:44.590
I knew all the pieces would
be here half an hour ago.

01:26:46.659 --> 01:26:50.459
Uniformed officers went
to each and everyone

01:26:50.461 --> 01:26:53.532
of your oh so
carefully hidden homes.

01:26:54.866 --> 01:26:58.103
Hat in hand, they
knocked on your doors

01:26:59.705 --> 01:27:02.004
and then asked your
wives with your children

01:27:02.006 --> 01:27:05.745
woken from their beds
could they come inside?

01:27:06.879 --> 01:27:08.615
Oh they had bad news.

01:27:11.817 --> 01:27:15.988
Now if any one of you wish to
see any of your family again,

01:27:21.059 --> 01:27:25.231
you will tell me where the
Orlov diamond is being taken

01:27:27.732 --> 01:27:28.567
tonight.

01:27:32.170 --> 01:27:35.340
Oh and as they say
in chess gentlemen,

01:27:39.911 --> 01:27:40.746
checkmate.

01:27:42.447 --> 01:27:43.779
Let's just find
the diamond and leave

01:27:43.781 --> 01:27:45.282
the country together.

01:27:45.284 --> 01:27:48.552
Listen if we return it to
India to the eye of Vishnu,

01:27:48.554 --> 01:27:50.319
we will want for nothing.

01:27:50.321 --> 01:27:54.858
Wait, we need to get
somethings clear here, sister.

01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:57.828
I haven't solved one thing
you came to me to investigate.

01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:59.162
What about your father?

01:27:59.164 --> 01:28:01.832
What about the man
dead in my office?

01:28:01.834 --> 01:28:04.568
And Katherine, I am not
stopping until I find out

01:28:04.570 --> 01:28:06.203
how she's tied into all this.

01:28:06.205 --> 01:28:08.105
Isn't that what you
were all fired up about?

01:28:08.107 --> 01:28:08.939
So?

01:28:08.941 --> 01:28:10.106
So?

01:28:10.108 --> 01:28:11.641
After hearing Gavron,
a lot of things

01:28:11.643 --> 01:28:15.148
are starting to make
sense, little things.

01:28:16.348 --> 01:28:19.919
I came into possession
of a book awhile ago.

01:28:22.787 --> 01:28:25.154
For months, it didn't make
sense, and then I met you.

01:28:25.156 --> 01:28:26.989
All of a sudden,
random names, numbers,

01:28:26.991 --> 01:28:28.891
information start popping up.

01:28:28.893 --> 01:28:33.663
I think between that and you,
I could find this diamond.

01:28:33.665 --> 01:28:35.731
I could bring down
Tate's operation.

01:28:35.733 --> 01:28:37.333
And, I could finally
clean up this city

01:28:37.335 --> 01:28:39.168
that you're suddenly in
such a hurray to leave.

01:28:39.170 --> 01:28:41.637
And, get us both
killed in the process.

01:28:41.639 --> 01:28:44.541
Gavron thought he was
being cryptic, all right.

01:28:44.543 --> 01:28:47.010
But, that book is the
last missing puzzle piece

01:28:47.012 --> 01:28:49.145
that makes all this make sense.

01:28:49.147 --> 01:28:52.114
I could find your diamond.

01:28:52.116 --> 01:28:53.350
Trust me?

01:28:54.353 --> 01:28:55.886
I trust you.

01:29:12.304 --> 01:29:13.636
Where to, mac?

01:29:13.638 --> 01:29:16.605
1130 Linden Avenue,
Warehouse District.

01:29:35.928 --> 01:29:37.593
We're almost there.

01:29:37.595 --> 01:29:39.695
How's the black book fit in?

01:29:39.697 --> 01:29:42.097
So I broke into your house.

01:29:42.099 --> 01:29:43.432
Broke into my house?

01:29:43.434 --> 01:29:44.834
Best place to hide it.

01:29:44.836 --> 01:29:46.002
Was at my house?

01:29:46.004 --> 01:29:46.802
Yeah don't worry,
I didn't touch

01:29:46.804 --> 01:29:47.937
your crappy brandy.

01:29:47.939 --> 01:29:49.472
What about the Cognac?

01:29:49.474 --> 01:29:51.007
It was good.

01:29:51.009 --> 01:29:53.342
That's when I found out what
was so ingenious about Nadia.

01:29:53.344 --> 01:29:55.511
All those random Russian
names all corresponded

01:29:55.513 --> 01:29:56.980
to numbers.

01:29:56.982 --> 01:29:59.983
Those numbers fit a grid that
matched the museum annex.

01:29:59.985 --> 01:30:02.452
Gavron filled in the rest.

01:30:02.454 --> 01:30:04.488
Jennifer and I didn't
know what we'd find

01:30:04.490 --> 01:30:07.757
at the secret museum
annex, Katherine, Tate,

01:30:07.759 --> 01:30:10.025
or hopefully just the diamond.

01:30:10.027 --> 01:30:12.061
We only knew that we
had to get it tonight.

01:30:12.063 --> 01:30:14.631
Or, the promise of the
jewel and a new life

01:30:14.633 --> 01:30:16.900
would fade into the
darkness of the black market

01:30:16.902 --> 01:30:18.571
and be lost forever.

01:30:26.210 --> 01:30:29.111
I want these wires
cut, the alarms off,

01:30:29.113 --> 01:30:31.384
this building shutdown now.

01:30:33.619 --> 01:30:35.584
Am I understood?

01:30:35.586 --> 01:30:37.087
Yes, sir.

01:30:40.459 --> 01:30:41.992
Excuse me sir,
what are you doing?

01:30:41.994 --> 01:30:43.092
No alarm has been set off.

01:30:44.662 --> 01:30:45.831
Alarmed yet.

01:31:57.068 --> 01:31:57.934
Drake!

01:32:00.037 --> 01:32:01.370
If only we had guns.

01:32:04.476 --> 01:32:05.408
I love you.

01:32:05.410 --> 01:32:06.245
Ditto.

01:32:14.085 --> 01:32:16.453
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

01:33:07.638 --> 01:33:10.606
Tate, you can't
get away with this!

01:33:10.608 --> 01:33:14.780
Once again, your persistence
will be your undoing.

01:33:16.548 --> 01:33:17.883
It's over Drake!

01:33:19.651 --> 01:33:21.153
You're late again.

01:33:34.232 --> 01:33:37.266
How does if feel to be just like

01:33:37.268 --> 01:33:39.735
a frightened little
Russian girl pleading

01:33:39.737 --> 01:33:44.740
for your worthless life and
no one's here to save you?

01:33:44.742 --> 01:33:45.708
I'm not pleading.

01:33:50.014 --> 01:33:53.048
Speaking of little
girls, you hit like one.

01:33:54.452 --> 01:33:56.618
You know if you
were as half as smart

01:33:56.620 --> 01:33:59.455
as your mouth, you would
have played ball with us

01:33:59.457 --> 01:34:01.458
like your partner did.

01:34:05.930 --> 01:34:09.434
You never did get
anything right, did you?

01:34:10.602 --> 01:34:12.671
Well now this is the end.

01:34:28.219 --> 01:34:29.718
Good luck with that.

01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:30.686
Come on.

01:34:30.688 --> 01:34:31.523
Okay.

01:34:52.244 --> 01:34:54.944
Looks like you're
at a dead end.

01:34:54.946 --> 01:34:57.216
Wow, eye for detail, Lew.

01:34:58.650 --> 01:35:02.552
Miss Montemar, I've been
admiring you from afar.

01:35:02.554 --> 01:35:05.622
Of course, that's how
I get to know people.

01:35:05.624 --> 01:35:09.057
But, most of all I've been
admiring that diamond.

01:35:09.059 --> 01:35:11.293
I understand it's priceless.

01:35:11.295 --> 01:35:13.631
So what's half of priceless?

01:35:16.334 --> 01:35:17.667
Even you wouldn't.

01:35:17.669 --> 01:35:19.636
Don't underestimate me, buddy.

01:35:19.638 --> 01:35:21.904
I've always been willing
to do what you couldn't.

01:35:21.906 --> 01:35:23.972
That's why I'm the one
with the nice suit,

01:35:23.974 --> 01:35:27.443
the car, the
office, and the gun.

01:35:27.445 --> 01:35:29.712
We were friends.

01:35:29.714 --> 01:35:32.148
You can't ask me to choose.

01:35:32.150 --> 01:35:34.284
Well profiting from an
unfortunate situation's

01:35:34.286 --> 01:35:37.287
the only way to stay
sane in a city like this.

01:35:37.289 --> 01:35:38.788
It doesn't take a
lot of detective work

01:35:38.790 --> 01:35:41.791
to know you're sweet on
her, but I'm warning you.

01:35:41.793 --> 01:35:43.461
You can't trust her.

01:35:44.696 --> 01:35:47.297
You'll thank me for
shooting her, Roland.

01:35:47.299 --> 01:35:50.970
As I say, we'll each
have half of priceless.

01:35:55.706 --> 01:35:56.506
Give it to me.

01:36:10.455 --> 01:36:11.457
Hey buddy.

01:36:14.759 --> 01:36:16.124
Sorry Lew.

01:36:17.728 --> 01:36:19.628
She's priceless.

01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:26.138
Tate is dead.

01:36:29.107 --> 01:36:31.940
I know I must've been a thorn
in your side as a partner.

01:36:31.942 --> 01:36:34.711
You made me too good a
detective to believe that.

01:36:36.214 --> 01:36:40.085
A bull in a china shop can
be useful if not aggravating.

01:36:41.486 --> 01:36:42.918
We have the diamond.

01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:44.020
This is our chance.

01:36:44.022 --> 01:36:44.857
Let's go.

01:36:46.323 --> 01:36:48.958
Wait, there's a trail
of bodies leading to you.

01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:51.727
I've seen Katherine
Montemar alive.

01:36:51.729 --> 01:36:53.529
Come on, who sent
you the photos?

01:36:53.531 --> 01:36:55.931
Who murdered your
mother, your father?

01:36:55.933 --> 01:36:57.233
It doesn't matter.

01:36:57.235 --> 01:37:00.238
We have the diamond,
and I love you.

01:37:01.238 --> 01:37:02.241
So let's go.

01:37:03.308 --> 01:37:04.274
No.

01:37:04.276 --> 01:37:05.507
I can meet you.

01:37:05.509 --> 01:37:08.914
Remember the time I
told you to trust me?

01:37:11.148 --> 01:37:13.650
And bring the world map too.

01:37:20.058 --> 01:37:22.824
And you, I know what you want.

01:37:22.826 --> 01:37:26.229
Pull yourself together
and meet me at my office.

01:37:47.285 --> 01:37:49.354
Okay, so here's the plan.

01:37:50.388 --> 01:37:53.623
I got a numbered key, number 77.

01:37:53.625 --> 01:37:55.394
I got two boxes here.

01:37:57.262 --> 01:37:59.695
One of them's the black book.

01:37:59.697 --> 01:38:02.664
The other one is a letter.

01:38:02.666 --> 01:38:04.734
I want both of
these to get to Lew.

01:38:04.736 --> 01:38:07.537
If anything happens to
me, he'll know what to do.

01:38:13.812 --> 01:38:15.278
Take me to the cemetery.

01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:16.412
She's still alive.

01:38:16.414 --> 01:38:17.713
This better be good.

01:38:17.715 --> 01:38:19.382
I wish I could say it was.

01:38:23.554 --> 01:38:24.619
Lots of bad news.

01:38:24.621 --> 01:38:25.855
It should be a good morning.

01:38:25.857 --> 01:38:28.458
The DA guy who was
after you got his, huh?

01:38:28.460 --> 01:38:30.562
I guess there is justice.

01:38:32.397 --> 01:38:33.663
Katherine.

01:38:33.665 --> 01:38:34.931
That was the beauty
of Katherine's plan.

01:38:34.933 --> 01:38:37.100
She was using the open
graves to bury bodies

01:38:37.102 --> 01:38:39.435
so no one would look there.

01:38:39.437 --> 01:38:41.173
The plan was perfect.

01:38:46.210 --> 01:38:49.511
How much do I believe
Jennifer anymore?

01:38:49.513 --> 01:38:51.547
She told me she didn't know him,

01:38:51.549 --> 01:38:53.052
then she shot him.

01:38:54.652 --> 01:38:57.056
This is Evergreen Cemetery.

01:38:58.756 --> 01:39:01.927
If Katherine is the
key, and trust me,

01:39:03.894 --> 01:39:05.727
I've learned enough
about this family to know

01:39:05.729 --> 01:39:10.666
that someone's gonna be
at the DA's grave tonight.

01:39:10.668 --> 01:39:13.069
I have more than
one gun, you know.

01:39:13.071 --> 01:39:15.137
I was counting on it Lew.

01:39:15.139 --> 01:39:18.740
I'll take priceless over
half of priceless any day.

01:39:18.742 --> 01:39:20.575
Give me the black book Roland.

01:39:20.577 --> 01:39:22.145
You don't want the diamond?

01:39:22.147 --> 01:39:23.279
No.

01:39:23.281 --> 01:39:24.713
What would I do with it?

01:39:24.715 --> 01:39:27.350
I couldn't even buy a
sandwich with that diamond.

01:39:27.352 --> 01:39:30.953
But, the black book,
now that's everything

01:39:30.955 --> 01:39:32.024
in this city.

01:39:33.191 --> 01:39:34.724
I guess you can
trade in ruining lives

01:39:34.726 --> 01:39:36.562
for cash forever, huh?

01:39:37.762 --> 01:39:39.494
Where I'm going I don't need it.

01:39:39.496 --> 01:39:41.064
I'm not coming back.

01:39:41.066 --> 01:39:42.233
Where is it?

01:39:45.903 --> 01:39:48.437
Don't think I won't use this.

01:39:48.439 --> 01:39:51.210
And, here I
thought we made up.

01:39:54.379 --> 01:39:56.145
Go to the drop box,
the one we used

01:39:56.147 --> 01:39:59.015
when we were in
business together.

01:39:59.017 --> 01:40:02.084
I'm not fond of you Roland.

01:40:02.086 --> 01:40:04.356
I think you should go away.

01:40:06.624 --> 01:40:10.795
But, with her, someplace
bright where you can see things

01:40:12.162 --> 01:40:12.997
coming.

01:40:14.299 --> 01:40:18.303
You always were a little
too shiny for the city.

01:40:19.804 --> 01:40:23.976
In this world, the one
that cares more always loses.

01:40:25.143 --> 01:40:27.846
The one with the
gun always wins.

01:40:29.179 --> 01:40:30.014
Get out.

01:40:32.349 --> 01:40:35.687
Katherine, you're
going away for good.

01:40:40.090 --> 01:40:42.925
Roland, do you love me?

01:40:42.927 --> 01:40:44.659
Nobody needs to know.

01:40:44.661 --> 01:40:46.428
My family never told
anybody that Katherine

01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:48.064
committed suicide.

01:40:48.066 --> 01:40:49.966
I can be Katherine.

01:40:49.968 --> 01:40:52.168
I can go into the
attorney's office.

01:40:52.170 --> 01:40:53.401
I can get the house.

01:40:53.403 --> 01:40:56.105
I can get everything,
and we can just go away.

01:40:56.107 --> 01:40:57.873
We can leave here together.

01:40:57.875 --> 01:40:59.641
I loved you.

01:40:59.643 --> 01:41:00.478
Not now.

01:41:01.812 --> 01:41:05.383
They need to know, and
you need to go away.

01:41:10.522 --> 01:41:12.989
I can be Katherine for you.

01:41:12.991 --> 01:41:14.856
You can have both of us.

01:41:20.631 --> 01:41:21.465
No.

01:41:24.536 --> 01:41:26.138
I'm sorry, Drake.

01:41:27.705 --> 01:41:29.004
You made me do this.

01:41:31.742 --> 01:41:32.708
You made me.

01:41:35.379 --> 01:41:36.811
I'm so sorry.

01:41:42.387 --> 01:41:43.388
I loved you.

01:41:55.433 --> 01:41:57.033
Lew, wait at your house.

01:41:57.035 --> 01:41:59.537
It will arrive at dawn, Drake.

01:42:03.273 --> 01:42:04.209
Son of a...

01:42:42.914 --> 01:42:44.579
I hope with all
that's left of my heart

01:42:44.581 --> 01:42:48.251
that we're on our way to India,
and that you never see this.

01:42:48.253 --> 01:42:50.352
If you are reading this,
I didn't get to cancel

01:42:50.354 --> 01:42:52.855
the package with
this letter to Lew

01:42:52.857 --> 01:42:56.659
because I was wrong
about you and about love.

01:42:56.661 --> 01:42:59.361
But, I guess I was wrong
about a lot of things.

01:43:25.156 --> 01:43:27.890
It was always about the diamond.

01:43:27.892 --> 01:43:30.359
I was just part of a plan
that was hard and faceted

01:43:30.361 --> 01:43:33.599
and icy as your
feelings and that rock.

01:43:35.165 --> 01:43:37.932
You toyed with my heart
with fickle carelessness

01:43:37.934 --> 01:43:39.401
and I fell for it.

01:44:36.126 --> 01:44:38.026
They say a kiss is the
way we love someone

01:44:38.028 --> 01:44:40.829
when words are not enough.

01:44:40.831 --> 01:44:44.033
Well this letter is my
kiss, my confession of love,

01:44:44.035 --> 01:44:46.534
and your confession of guilt.

01:44:46.536 --> 01:44:47.638
I was a fool.

01:44:48.805 --> 01:44:51.707
I wanted you, but I
wanted the truth more.

01:44:55.912 --> 01:44:58.047
Miss Montemar, mam?

01:45:00.050 --> 01:45:02.851
I finally know
exactly why you hired me,

01:45:02.853 --> 01:45:06.187
to be your fall guy,
and I fell all right.

01:45:06.189 --> 01:45:08.257
I guess you were right about me.

01:45:08.259 --> 01:45:10.392
I am good at my job.

01:45:10.394 --> 01:45:13.529
I knew you were trouble,
but then trouble

01:45:13.531 --> 01:45:14.864
was my business.
