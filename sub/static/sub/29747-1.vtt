00:01.000 --> 00:05.106
(film reel clicking)
(dramatic music)

00:10.544 --> 00:13.114
(somber music)

00:22.423 --> 00:25.159
(pleasant music)

01:34.195 --> 01:36.764
(upbeat music)

01:38.466 --> 01:40.801
- [Man] Go ahead, get it up.

01:43.237 --> 01:44.738
Go ahead, go ahead.

01:44.772 --> 01:47.074
(whistling)

01:48.742 --> 01:50.944
(laughing)

01:52.713 --> 01:54.748
- I think we need
a little review.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.384
Remember how I tagged everything

01:56.417 --> 01:58.252
by the room it's
supposed to go in?

01:58.286 --> 01:59.153
- Yes, Mom.

01:59.187 --> 02:00.588
- [Kids] Yes, Mom.

02:00.621 --> 02:04.091
- So, if it's marked "K-I-T"

02:04.124 --> 02:05.058
it goes into the--

02:05.092 --> 02:05.926
- Kitchen.

02:05.959 --> 02:06.760
- Good one.

02:06.794 --> 02:08.095
- Thank you, Debbie.

02:08.127 --> 02:12.533
And if it's marked
"1-KID-B-R" it goes into the--

02:12.566 --> 02:13.634
- First kids bedroom.

02:13.667 --> 02:14.835
- Thank you, Becky.

02:14.868 --> 02:15.769
- Nice work.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.805
- So, why am I finding boxes

02:17.838 --> 02:20.174
in rooms they're not
supposed to go in?

02:21.309 --> 02:22.543
Yes, Jonathan?

02:22.576 --> 02:23.911
- I can't read.

02:23.944 --> 02:26.046
I don't know where stuff goes.

02:26.079 --> 02:27.281
- Hmmm.

02:27.315 --> 02:29.450
- All right, well, maybe
some of you older ones

02:29.483 --> 02:30.784
can help him, okay?

02:30.818 --> 02:32.953
We're in this together,
we've moved before.

02:32.986 --> 02:33.854
- [Dad] Yeah.

02:33.887 --> 02:34.688
- All right.

02:34.722 --> 02:35.523
Let's go!

02:35.556 --> 02:36.357
- [Dad] All right.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.458
You wanna grab that box?

02:37.491 --> 02:39.126
- [Mom] Goes in the kitchen!

02:39.159 --> 02:40.894
- [Dad] Right into the kitchen.

02:40.928 --> 02:41.829
Okay?

02:41.862 --> 02:42.896
Perfect.

02:42.930 --> 02:44.064
- I'm sorry, Mom.

02:44.097 --> 02:45.366
- That's okay, Mary.

02:45.399 --> 02:46.900
(chuckling)

02:46.934 --> 02:48.636
- You are amazing.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.440
I forgot you knew how
to whistle like that.

02:52.473 --> 02:54.742
- Well you can take the
girl out of the country,

02:54.775 --> 02:56.844
but you can't take the
country out of the girl.

02:56.877 --> 02:58.812
- Mm-hmmm.
(chuckling)

02:58.846 --> 03:02.516
So, this goes into the basement?

03:02.550 --> 03:03.617
- You put that in the basement,

03:03.651 --> 03:04.752
I'll put you in the basement.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.053
(laughing)

03:06.086 --> 03:09.323
(pleasant piano music)

03:15.162 --> 03:19.367
* Take the name of
Jesus with you *

03:19.400 --> 03:23.971
* Child of sorrow and of woe

03:24.004 --> 03:28.342
* It will joy and
comfort give you *

03:28.376 --> 03:32.746
* Take it then wherever you go

03:32.780 --> 03:34.582
- As you all know,

03:34.615 --> 03:38.819
we've been searching for
a pastor for quite awhile.

03:38.852 --> 03:42.122
We're so excited to have
him and his family here

03:42.155 --> 03:44.692
as they help grow
our congregation.

03:45.626 --> 03:46.827
Let's pray.

03:46.860 --> 03:49.363
Lord Jesus, I just thank
you for Pastor Albert.

03:49.397 --> 03:51.064
I thank you for his wife Aimee,

03:51.098 --> 03:53.701
and I thank you for
their lovely family.

03:53.734 --> 03:57.237
I pray your blessing
upon our congregation

03:57.271 --> 04:01.875
as you lead Pastor Albert
to lead us in your ways

04:01.909 --> 04:05.713
through his gifted teaching
and his anointed leadership.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.448
Father we just thank
you and praise you.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.317
In Jesus name.

04:09.350 --> 04:10.150
Amen.

04:10.183 --> 04:11.852
- [Congregation] Amen.

04:11.885 --> 04:12.686
- Church!

04:12.720 --> 04:14.021
The Andersons!

04:14.054 --> 04:16.457
(applauding)

04:18.125 --> 04:20.761
- My family and I feel
extremely blessed to be here.

04:21.661 --> 04:23.731
We felt a calling to come.

04:23.764 --> 04:27.000
We felt led to this
beautiful town.

04:28.168 --> 04:29.570
After our first
meeting with Chris

04:29.603 --> 04:31.539
and the rest of the board,

04:31.572 --> 04:34.074
Aimee and I went
home and we prayed

04:34.107 --> 04:35.776
with our six wonderful children.

04:37.044 --> 04:39.980
The Lord led us to Isaiah 43,

04:40.013 --> 04:41.982
verses 16-21.

04:42.015 --> 04:44.685
(somber music)

04:44.718 --> 04:45.919
- Mom,

04:45.953 --> 04:46.854
can the kids and
I go play outside?

04:46.887 --> 04:48.155
Mrs. Reese said it was okay.

04:48.188 --> 04:49.122
- Of course.

04:49.156 --> 04:50.424
Have fun.

04:50.458 --> 04:51.291
- Let's go.

04:52.326 --> 04:53.527
- Grab your plates guys.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.198
- Thank you, Mrs. Reese.

04:58.231 --> 04:59.299
It was yummy.

04:59.333 --> 05:00.133
(chuckling)

05:00.167 --> 05:01.068
- You're welcome.

05:01.101 --> 05:02.135
- [Becky] Thank you so much.

05:02.169 --> 05:03.003
- You're welcome.

05:04.237 --> 05:06.340
You have such
wonderful children.

05:06.374 --> 05:08.576
They seem to truly love
and respect each other.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.277
- Thank you, we're
really proud of them.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.245
- Well, that just comes
from good parenting,

05:12.279 --> 05:14.448
and God's grace.

05:14.482 --> 05:15.983
- We're really glad you're here.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.919
Are we gonna see a revival
in this town anytime soon?

05:18.952 --> 05:20.954
- Well, I certainly hope so.

05:20.988 --> 05:25.559
Always be ready to preach the
Gospel, in season and out.

05:25.593 --> 05:27.861
- We're going to get
along just fine, Pastor.

05:27.895 --> 05:29.597
- We really want to
see you succeed here,

05:29.630 --> 05:32.533
so any support we can
give you, let us know.

05:32.566 --> 05:33.701
- Oh, that's sweet.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.235
- Thank you, we really
appreciate that.

05:35.268 --> 05:37.070
- Do you like fishing, Albert?

05:37.104 --> 05:39.373
- Are we still talking
spiritually, or?

05:39.407 --> 05:40.708
(laughing)

05:40.741 --> 05:42.743
- I mean actual fish.
(chuckling)

05:42.776 --> 05:45.513
- Well, I don't get to
often, but yes I do.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.314
- We have a houseboat
down at the marina

05:47.347 --> 05:49.617
and we'd love to have you
come join us this Saturday.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.051
If you're available.

05:51.084 --> 05:52.252
- That would be great!

05:52.285 --> 05:53.387
- Absolutely, the
kids would love that.

05:53.421 --> 05:54.688
- Well then, it's set!

05:54.722 --> 05:56.189
(chuckling)

05:56.223 --> 05:57.625
- I'm gonna have to find my rod.

05:57.658 --> 05:58.892
- Yeah.
(laughing)

05:58.926 --> 06:00.894
(pleasant music)

06:00.928 --> 06:03.330
(chattering)

06:08.502 --> 06:10.971
- Thank you all so much for
coming out this evening.

06:11.004 --> 06:13.240
Aimee and I thought
that we would do just

06:13.273 --> 06:14.542
a basic marriage seminar

06:14.575 --> 06:16.076
to all help up to get
to know each other

06:16.109 --> 06:18.812
and our stories a
bit better as well.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.380
Sound good?

06:20.414 --> 06:23.984
- Now Aimee would say that our
marriage is a love story.

06:24.852 --> 06:25.686
Right, Sweetheart?

06:25.719 --> 06:27.120
- Right.

06:27.154 --> 06:28.989
- I always get a little nervous
when I ask that question.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.323
(chuckling)

06:30.357 --> 06:32.225
Hollywood would lead
us to believe that

06:32.259 --> 06:35.863
a love story takes place
in two hours or less,

06:35.896 --> 06:37.064
but a real love--

06:37.097 --> 06:38.365
- Albert leaned
over and whispered,

06:38.398 --> 06:40.501
"I have something
for you, Aimee."

06:40.534 --> 06:42.069
My heart was fluttering.

06:42.102 --> 06:43.537
- And so was mine.

06:43.571 --> 06:44.772
(chuckling)

06:44.805 --> 06:46.640
Gentleman, you'll
appreciate this one.

06:46.674 --> 06:48.308
One hot summer afternoon,

06:48.341 --> 06:51.111
Aimee decided to help
out with the yard work.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.045
- Albert!

06:52.079 --> 06:53.180
- What? It's a funny story.

06:53.213 --> 06:54.114
- [Aimee] Yeah, to you.

06:54.147 --> 06:57.084
- Okay, well, needless to say,

06:57.117 --> 06:59.252
Aimee got angry
with the lawn mower.

06:59.286 --> 07:02.155
- Ladies, when It comes
to making decisions,

07:02.189 --> 07:05.526
being a marriage partner comes
with great responsibility.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.561
- Now Gentlemen, the
Seahawks didn't just walk out

07:07.595 --> 07:10.030
onto that field and collect
those Superbowl rings,

07:10.063 --> 07:11.064
now did they?

07:11.098 --> 07:12.232
(chuckling)

07:12.265 --> 07:14.434
A real marriage takes
a lot of effort.

07:15.469 --> 07:18.438
It has to be nurtured, worked,

07:18.472 --> 07:19.439
and fought for.

07:23.376 --> 07:25.979
Bade, your wife said you
wanted to chat with us?

07:26.013 --> 07:27.380
- Yeah, well I just
want to tell you

07:27.414 --> 07:29.817
my wife and I both
really liked your talk.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.084
- Nancy mentioned that.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.920
- Gonna need your help,
I can tell you that.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.555
You may regret it someday,

07:34.588 --> 07:37.324
but we really do need
your help that's for sure.

07:37.357 --> 07:39.693
- Okay, well, if you
want to call the office

07:39.727 --> 07:42.329
and set up an appointment,
we'll see what we can do.

07:42.362 --> 07:43.196
- Will do.

07:48.201 --> 07:50.103
- That was interesting.

07:51.672 --> 07:52.973
- The devil's in that one.

07:53.006 --> 07:53.941
- [Albert] Excuse me?

07:53.974 --> 07:55.408
- Well, I mean,

07:55.442 --> 07:58.579
there's just something
not quite right about him.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.681
- We need to be careful, Chris.

08:00.714 --> 08:03.016
Well, maybe he just
really needs our help.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.118
- Other pastors have tried.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.820
It's lead to
nothing but trouble.

08:07.921 --> 08:10.023
And, I want you to know,

08:10.057 --> 08:11.525
you did a good job tonight.

08:12.459 --> 08:13.561
Nice job.

08:13.594 --> 08:14.427
- Thank you.

08:18.031 --> 08:21.034
- And that was interesting.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.703
- We need to pray for grace.

08:30.143 --> 08:32.913
(pleasant music)

09:17.891 --> 09:19.259
(laughing)
- [Albert] Really?

09:19.292 --> 09:20.193
- [Luke] Yeah.

09:20.227 --> 09:20.928
- [Albert] Chris did that?

09:20.961 --> 09:21.995
- [Luke] Yeah.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.731
(laughing)
- Well, I had no idea.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.799
- It took him months to
live down that title.

09:25.833 --> 09:27.635
- That is some great ammunition

09:27.668 --> 09:29.169
for the next board
meeting though, thank you.

09:29.202 --> 09:30.804
(laughing)

09:30.838 --> 09:32.205
- Yeah.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.407
- So, how are you
enjoying your retirement?

09:34.441 --> 09:35.776
- It's different all right.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.311
Still just as busy though.

09:38.345 --> 09:41.081
(fishing line cranking)

09:41.114 --> 09:44.317
Between the house, new boat,

09:44.351 --> 09:45.418
the yard,

09:45.452 --> 09:46.253
kids,

09:46.286 --> 09:47.921
grandkids.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.723
All the church
activities, of course.

09:49.757 --> 09:50.658
- Yeah, you know
I've been meaning

09:50.691 --> 09:52.092
to say something about that.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.694
You know, most people
check out when they retire,

09:53.727 --> 09:54.928
but you two?

09:54.962 --> 09:57.064
You're still just as
involved, I love that.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.566
- Well God has a reason
for us to still be here.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.735
And it's not just
to serve ourselves.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.739
I want to hear "well done,"

10:06.874 --> 10:10.711
not "well done until
the last mile."

10:10.744 --> 10:12.079
(chuckling)

10:12.112 --> 10:13.113
- I like that.

10:13.146 --> 10:14.748
I like that a lot actually.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.283
You mind if I use that
in one of my sermons?

10:16.316 --> 10:18.151
- Oh, go right ahead.

10:18.185 --> 10:18.986
- Oh!

10:19.019 --> 10:20.187
Oh, I think I got one.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.488
- [Luke] Oh! Hang on
to him! Hang on to him!

10:21.521 --> 10:22.923
Oh, he's pulling on it!

10:22.956 --> 10:23.757
All right.

10:23.791 --> 10:24.692
Bring it in slowly.

10:24.725 --> 10:25.926
I'll pull mine in.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.194
- [Albert] The kids
are going to be happy.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.329
- [Luke] We're gonna
have dinner tonight!

10:29.362 --> 10:31.064
(pleasant music)

10:31.098 --> 10:33.166
- Thank you so much
for having us here.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.835
It's a perfect day.

10:34.868 --> 10:35.803
- Isn't it?

10:35.836 --> 10:36.770
I can't think of a better way

10:36.804 --> 10:38.205
to get to know our new friends.

10:38.939 --> 10:42.409
- So, tell me more about growing
up as a pastor's daughter.

10:42.442 --> 10:44.544
Maybe I'll learn some things
I can help my own kids with.

10:44.577 --> 10:47.180
- Oh, honey, your
kids are great.

10:47.214 --> 10:49.750
They're a joy and blessing
to us, believe me.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.418
- Thank you.

10:51.451 --> 10:53.153
But seriously, anything?

10:55.689 --> 10:57.424
- Well, times are different now.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.227
There'll always be
someone who has an opinion

11:00.260 --> 11:01.661
about you and your family,

11:01.695 --> 11:03.697
constantly under a microscope.

11:04.865 --> 11:08.168
Everyone will be looking
to you, to your kids,

11:08.201 --> 11:10.203
to see how their
kids should behave.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.005
Either way,

11:12.906 --> 11:14.107
listen to the Lord.

11:15.242 --> 11:17.310
Let God be your
strength and grace.

11:19.412 --> 11:21.481
- I've never had anyone
I could confide in

11:21.514 --> 11:23.583
that might understand
what it's like.

11:23.616 --> 11:24.651
- Oh.

11:24.684 --> 11:25.685
Well you're welcome.

11:27.154 --> 11:28.688
I'll be praying for you.

11:28.722 --> 11:29.890
- Fervently, I hope.

11:29.923 --> 11:31.158
- Is there any other way?

11:31.191 --> 11:32.059
(laughing)

11:32.092 --> 11:33.026
- I don't think so.

11:35.729 --> 11:36.529
- [Debbie] Mom!

11:36.563 --> 11:37.865
Dad's back!

11:37.898 --> 11:39.099
- You go it?

11:39.132 --> 11:42.035
- [Eunice] Look,
Dad caught a fish!

11:43.804 --> 11:45.839
- Hey, look at this.

11:48.041 --> 11:48.842
Eh?

11:50.143 --> 11:51.478
- Wow, Dad, that is a big one!

11:51.511 --> 11:52.445
- It is.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.181
Yeah, you want to touch it?

11:54.214 --> 11:55.448
Slimy, isn't it?

11:55.482 --> 11:57.017
How about you Mark,
you want to touch it?

11:57.050 --> 11:59.119
Yeah, woe, look at you!

11:59.152 --> 12:00.620
(laughing)

12:00.653 --> 12:02.756
- Dad, can we catch another
one and keep it as a pet?

12:02.790 --> 12:04.291
- Oh, bless her heart.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.593
(laughing)

12:09.496 --> 12:11.431
- Hey, that looks pretty good.

12:11.464 --> 12:13.033
- Thanks.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.902
- You know if this
whole pastoring thing
doesn't work out,

12:14.935 --> 12:17.270
you might want to consider
becoming a butcher.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.307
- Thanks, honey.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.208
- You're welcome.

12:22.609 --> 12:23.844
Today was a good day.

12:23.877 --> 12:24.912
- It was.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.479
- They're a real Godsend.

12:26.513 --> 12:27.347
- Mm-hmm.

12:29.316 --> 12:31.051
- You don't think so?

12:31.084 --> 12:33.120
- Well, of of course I
do, I think they're great.

12:35.455 --> 12:36.289
- But?

12:38.792 --> 12:39.759
- It's just...

12:41.028 --> 12:42.129
We need to be careful.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.732
Look, I know you think
the world of Francine.

12:45.765 --> 12:48.435
And I feel the same
way about Luke.

12:48.468 --> 12:51.738
But, people can get jealous
if they get the idea

12:51.771 --> 12:53.006
that the pastor and or his wife

12:53.040 --> 12:54.607
think more highly
of someone else.

12:54.641 --> 12:56.476
- But that's not--
- I know.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.547
We didn't run into anything
like this at Mountain View,

13:00.580 --> 13:03.216
but I think there are
definitely some jealousies

13:03.250 --> 13:04.384
to contend with here.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.889
- All right, I'll be careful.

13:10.490 --> 13:11.491
- Thank you.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.395
- Speaking of careful.

13:15.428 --> 13:16.629
- Hmmm?

13:16.663 --> 13:18.431
- That couple the other
night at the seminar.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.332
- The Blake's?

13:19.366 --> 13:20.400
- Yeah.

13:20.433 --> 13:21.835
What was that all about?

13:21.869 --> 13:23.770
- Yeah, I'm not sure
what to make of that yet.

13:24.204 --> 13:27.174
You know Bade really seems to
be searching for something,

13:27.207 --> 13:29.476
but I'm wondering
if there might be

13:29.509 --> 13:31.979
some mental issues
there as well.

13:32.012 --> 13:34.047
Maybe there's something
I can do to help.

13:38.385 --> 13:39.219
- I love you.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.923
- Now that is not fair.

13:42.956 --> 13:44.224
- What?

13:44.257 --> 13:46.026
- I'm covered in fish guts.

13:47.060 --> 13:48.028
- I don't care.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.662
- Oh, you don't, huh?

13:49.696 --> 13:50.898
(laughing)

13:50.931 --> 13:51.798
Come back here you!
- I do! I do care!

13:51.831 --> 13:52.933
I do care!

13:52.966 --> 13:55.202
(laughing)

13:55.235 --> 13:56.536
(somber music)

13:56.569 --> 13:57.737
- You know we all come
from different seasons

13:57.770 --> 13:59.306
in our lives right now.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.208
Some of us are still
changing diapers

14:01.241 --> 14:02.742
and planning play dates.

14:02.775 --> 14:04.344
While others, Faye, I
know you have a child

14:04.377 --> 14:06.013
going off to
college in the fall.

14:07.480 --> 14:10.850
But it doesn't stop us being
concerned for their safety.

14:10.884 --> 14:13.853
I have grown children and
I still worry about them.

14:15.222 --> 14:17.390
Our nurturing and caring
doesn't turn off like a faucet

14:17.424 --> 14:19.359
just because they
leave the nest.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.061
It's a constant struggle.

14:21.094 --> 14:22.762
That's where Hannah
had it right,

14:23.696 --> 14:25.865
placing Samuel in Eli's care,

14:25.899 --> 14:27.467
in the Lord's house.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.169
If we can do that

14:29.202 --> 14:32.239
then we can we truly focus
on just loving our kids.

14:34.707 --> 14:35.508
- [Woman] It was wonderful.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.910
- Isn't Hannah amazing?

14:36.944 --> 14:38.411
- [Woman] Yes, absolutely.

14:38.445 --> 14:39.879
- [Francine] It helps us to
really focus on our children.

14:39.913 --> 14:40.914
- [Redheaded Woman]
Thank you for hosting.

14:40.948 --> 14:44.084
- Sure, it was my pleasure.

14:44.117 --> 14:46.686
(somber music)

14:47.921 --> 14:48.821
Oh, that's a good idea.

14:48.855 --> 14:50.123
Would you ladies excuse me?

14:50.157 --> 14:51.024
- Oh, certainly.

14:51.058 --> 14:51.891
- Thank you.

14:57.264 --> 14:58.531
Aimee, are you all right?

15:00.500 --> 15:01.401
- I'm fine.

15:01.434 --> 15:02.970
- Oh, you can talk to me, honey.

15:03.003 --> 15:04.404
What's the matter?

15:05.572 --> 15:08.141
- Albert's concerned
about our friendship.

15:08.175 --> 15:09.142
- Did I do something wrong?

15:09.176 --> 15:11.144
- No, no, not at all.

15:11.178 --> 15:13.646
He's just worried that other
women in the congregation

15:13.680 --> 15:16.849
might get jealous if it
looks like I'm favoring you.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.586
- I've seen that happen
in churches more often

15:19.619 --> 15:21.654
than I'd like to mention.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.123
Albert's wise to bring it up.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.892
Oh, we'll figure this out.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.394
I have to tell you,

15:27.427 --> 15:29.462
God brought you into my life

15:29.496 --> 15:32.966
to remind me of something I
really needed reminding of.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.634
We'll work it out Aimee.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.303
- Thank you.

15:36.336 --> 15:38.338
Thank you for being
such a great friend.

15:44.944 --> 15:45.778
- Come on.

15:49.182 --> 15:51.151
(thunder rumbling)

15:51.184 --> 15:54.654
(foreboding music)

15:54.687 --> 15:57.257
God brought you into
my life for a reason.

16:00.260 --> 16:02.695
(eerie music)

16:05.798 --> 16:08.235
(whimpering)

16:09.402 --> 16:10.337
Aimee.
(gunshot booming)

16:10.370 --> 16:13.506
(bird wings flapping)

16:13.540 --> 16:15.708
(huffing)

16:17.177 --> 16:19.912
(birds chirping)

16:29.122 --> 16:31.891
(Albert humming)

16:35.262 --> 16:36.063
- Good morning.

16:36.096 --> 16:37.330
- Good morning.

16:38.431 --> 16:39.266
- Sleep well?

16:43.170 --> 16:45.238
Sweetheart, you okay?

16:46.706 --> 16:47.974
- Yeah, I just...

16:49.176 --> 16:50.810
I had a bad dream.

16:50.843 --> 16:51.678
- About what?

16:52.812 --> 16:54.381
- It was about Francine.

16:54.414 --> 16:55.882
- Hmmm.

16:55.915 --> 16:58.651
I hope it wasn't
because of what I said.

16:58.685 --> 16:59.619
- I'm fine.

16:59.652 --> 17:01.088
I'm sure everything's all right.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.056
I'll give her a call today.

17:03.090 --> 17:04.624
- Okay.

17:04.656 --> 17:07.127
Well, I am heading
to the office.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.928
I've got couple of
counseling sessions

17:08.961 --> 17:10.930
and then lunch with the board.

17:11.964 --> 17:13.133
- I'll pray for you.

17:13.165 --> 17:14.166
- Yes, please.

17:14.201 --> 17:15.001
(laughing)

17:15.034 --> 17:16.603
- Don't worry.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.238
- Call me if anything comes up.

17:18.271 --> 17:19.106
- I will.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.141
Take care.

17:21.174 --> 17:21.973
- Love you.

17:22.008 --> 17:22.842
- Love you too.

17:29.949 --> 17:30.783
Francine.

17:33.986 --> 17:35.522
- [Francine Voicemail] Thank
you for calling the Reese's.

17:35.555 --> 17:38.057
Leave a message and we'll get
back to you as soon as we can.

17:38.091 --> 17:40.127
(phone beeping)

17:40.160 --> 17:42.829
(ominous music)

18:02.849 --> 18:05.685
(gunshot booming)

18:32.912 --> 18:35.582
(phone ringing)

18:39.186 --> 18:40.387
- Hello?

18:40.420 --> 18:41.488
- Hi Flint, this
is Aimee Anderson,

18:41.521 --> 18:42.989
I'm a friend of your mother's.

18:43.022 --> 18:45.358
- Ah, you're the Pastor's wife
at my parents church, right?

18:45.392 --> 18:46.459
- Yes, that's right.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.630
Flint, I was trying to reach
your mother over a meal

18:50.663 --> 18:53.200
she offered to
provide for a widow.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.367
Have you heard from her?

18:54.401 --> 18:55.868
- Yeah, no. no, I
wouldn't worry about it.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.637
No, they got working
their yard,

18:57.670 --> 18:59.138
they don't hear the phone.

18:59.172 --> 19:01.208
Cell phone coverage out there
is pretty much non-existent.

19:01.241 --> 19:03.443
Country life, right?

19:03.476 --> 19:05.412
- Well, if you do hear from her,

19:05.445 --> 19:06.979
can you ask her
to give me a call?

19:07.013 --> 19:07.980
- You bet.

19:08.014 --> 19:08.915
- Thanks so much.

19:08.948 --> 19:10.283
- [Flint] Bye, bye.

19:10.317 --> 19:12.885
(somber music)

19:21.694 --> 19:23.095
- Honey.

19:23.129 --> 19:24.597
Did I forget about a meeting?

19:24.631 --> 19:26.833
- No, I wanted to go out to
Luke and Francine's place.

19:26.866 --> 19:28.668
- Sweetheart, we can't
just show up like that.

19:28.701 --> 19:31.304
- I'm still having
nightmares about them.

19:31.338 --> 19:33.606
No one, including their son,
seems to know where they are.

19:33.640 --> 19:36.443
I'd really feel a lot
better if we could go check.

19:36.476 --> 19:37.644
- Okay, let's go.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.713
- Debbie, we're going.

19:40.747 --> 19:41.914
- Okay, bye.

19:43.650 --> 19:46.219
(somber music)

19:52.124 --> 19:52.959
- Wait here.

19:54.227 --> 19:55.061
- Okay.

19:57.630 --> 20:00.833
(birds chirping)

20:00.867 --> 20:03.102
(knocking)

20:10.477 --> 20:13.413
(doorbell ringing)

20:25.758 --> 20:28.361
(sighing)

20:28.395 --> 20:29.596
- Knocked on the door.

20:29.629 --> 20:30.930
Rang the bell.

20:30.963 --> 20:32.432
No answer.

20:32.465 --> 20:33.566
- I hope they're all right.

20:33.600 --> 20:34.801
- I'm sure they're fine.

20:35.968 --> 20:38.338
Just give her a
call in the morning

20:38.371 --> 20:39.506
and if you aren't
able to reach her,

20:39.539 --> 20:41.474
we'll come back
tomorrow evening, okay?

20:42.809 --> 20:44.377
- Okay.
- All right.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.349
- Oh, hi, Susan.

20:49.382 --> 20:50.182
Hi.

20:51.384 --> 20:53.453
Has Francine been to
your place this week?

20:55.322 --> 20:56.656
- Oh, hi, Fay, how are you?

20:57.724 --> 20:59.258
Great, it's Aimee.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.695
I was wondering if you've
heard from Francine today.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.033
You haven't either, huh?

21:08.568 --> 21:09.936
Oh, hi, George, I
was just wondering

21:09.969 --> 21:11.504
if their boat was still docked.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.142
This might be a bit odd but

21:16.175 --> 21:18.277
I was wondering if the Reese's

21:18.311 --> 21:20.747
have come in to pick up
their shipment this week?

21:22.715 --> 21:23.750
Veronica!

21:23.783 --> 21:24.617
Hi.

21:25.518 --> 21:27.420
You know, I was just calling

21:27.454 --> 21:29.322
to see if you've
heard from Francine.

21:32.325 --> 21:33.159
You haven't.

21:34.594 --> 21:35.928
Yeah, you know I haven't
heard from her for a while

21:35.962 --> 21:38.164
and I was starting to
get a bit concerned.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.635
You're right, we'll just...

21:42.669 --> 21:45.872
Well you take care
and God bless you,

21:45.905 --> 21:47.273
and we'll see you on Sunday.

21:48.875 --> 21:49.642
Great.

21:50.777 --> 21:51.978
Have a good day.

21:52.011 --> 21:52.812
Bye, bye.

22:00.019 --> 22:02.655
(dramatic music)

22:27.814 --> 22:30.149
Thanks for doing
this with me again.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.851
I don't think I
could do it alone.

22:31.884 --> 22:34.487
- Oh, I wouldn't want you to.

22:34.521 --> 22:35.722
In all honesty,

22:35.755 --> 22:38.124
I'm starting to get a
little concerned myself.

22:38.157 --> 22:41.394
So I scheduled a
pastoral meeting in
the same area tonight.

22:41.428 --> 22:42.328
- At the Renton's?

22:42.361 --> 22:43.195
- Mm-hmm.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.132
- Thank you.

22:46.165 --> 22:47.366
- Of course, sweetheart.

22:48.401 --> 22:50.970
(somber music)

22:56.208 --> 22:59.178
- I was hoping we'd find
them working in the yard.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.146
- I'll go check.

23:00.179 --> 23:00.947
- Wait.

23:02.281 --> 23:03.750
Something doesn't feel right.

23:04.584 --> 23:05.752
Can we pray?

23:05.785 --> 23:06.619
- Of course.

23:10.623 --> 23:13.626
Heavenly Father, you
are our protector,

23:13.660 --> 23:16.095
you are our rock, our comforter.

23:17.697 --> 23:18.598
We'd like to lift
Luke and Francine

23:18.631 --> 23:20.767
up to you right now, Lord,

23:20.800 --> 23:22.669
that wherever they are,
whether they're at home

23:22.702 --> 23:25.137
or elsewhere that they are in
the palm of your hand Lord,

23:25.171 --> 23:28.541
and that you are keeping
them safe and protected.

23:30.877 --> 23:32.945
Thank you, Lord.

23:32.979 --> 23:33.780
Amen.

23:33.813 --> 23:35.047
- Amen.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.816
- I'll be right back.

23:40.653 --> 23:43.222
(somber music)

23:48.394 --> 23:50.663
(knocking)

23:53.866 --> 23:54.701
Hello?

23:57.737 --> 23:58.538
Luke?

24:00.406 --> 24:01.207
Francine?

24:02.141 --> 24:03.142
It's Albert.

24:34.907 --> 24:35.742
- Well?

24:37.644 --> 24:38.477
- Nothing.

24:39.912 --> 24:40.747
- Nothing?

24:43.550 --> 24:46.418
- The door was open
a crack, but still...

24:48.521 --> 24:51.490
When I knocked on the door
last night it was shut.

24:52.892 --> 24:53.693
- Are you sure?

24:53.726 --> 24:54.561
- Positive.

24:56.128 --> 24:57.396
- I think we should
call the police.

24:57.429 --> 24:58.598
- No, hold on.

24:59.566 --> 25:01.000
Let's try Flint first,

25:01.033 --> 25:02.835
see if he knows what's going on.

25:02.869 --> 25:04.070
All right, let's
get to the Renton's

25:04.103 --> 25:06.072
and we'll call him from there.

25:07.540 --> 25:10.209
(ominous music)

25:12.111 --> 25:14.346
(knocking)

25:17.449 --> 25:18.718
- Pastor Anderson.

25:18.751 --> 25:19.652
Welcome.

25:19.686 --> 25:20.452
- Thank you, Mrs. Renton.

25:20.486 --> 25:21.220
- Can we use your phone?

25:21.253 --> 25:22.054
- Of course.

25:22.088 --> 25:23.122
It's in the kitchen.

25:23.155 --> 25:24.356
- Thank you.

25:24.390 --> 25:26.425
- But I thought you were
here for the meeting.

25:30.396 --> 25:32.932
(dial tone buzzing)

25:32.965 --> 25:33.766
- [Flint] Hello?

25:33.800 --> 25:34.701
- Flint.

25:34.734 --> 25:36.235
This is Aimee Anderson calling.

25:36.268 --> 25:38.237
I was wondering if you found
out where your parents are.

25:38.270 --> 25:40.039
- [Flint] No, I've been
checking around, but--

25:40.072 --> 25:41.407
- Well, have you been to their
place or just phoned them?

25:41.440 --> 25:42.909
- [Flint] Yeah, just phoned.

25:42.942 --> 25:45.011
I really didn't think I
needed to go out there.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.579
- Flint,

25:46.613 --> 25:49.481
my husband and I went to their
home earlier this evening.

25:50.650 --> 25:52.484
Albert found the
door open a crack

25:52.518 --> 25:54.687
and he called inside,
but there was no answer.

25:54.721 --> 25:56.288
- [Flint] No, that's
not like them.

25:56.322 --> 25:57.223
I'll head up there now.

25:57.256 --> 25:59.025
- Okay, we'll meet you there.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.159
- Is everything okay?

26:00.192 --> 26:01.694
- We're not sure.

26:01.728 --> 26:03.329
I'm sorry, do you
mind if we reschedule?

26:03.362 --> 26:04.631
- Certainly.

26:04.664 --> 26:06.065
I hope it's nothing serious.

26:07.533 --> 26:09.636
- Yeah, so do we.

26:09.669 --> 26:10.670
- Thank you.

26:26.853 --> 26:28.688
- They're both here...

26:31.257 --> 26:32.692
but they're gone.

26:37.764 --> 26:40.432
(ominous music)

26:47.073 --> 26:49.809
(flies buzzing)

26:49.842 --> 26:51.343
- Here Sweetheart.

26:53.646 --> 26:56.548
(foreboding music)

27:09.028 --> 27:10.429
- In the bedroom.

27:13.299 --> 27:16.068
(dramatic music)

27:17.436 --> 27:19.605
(weeping)

27:37.256 --> 27:39.325
- The police are on their way?

27:39.358 --> 27:40.226
- Police?

27:40.259 --> 27:41.493
- You didn't call them?

27:41.527 --> 27:42.729
- No, I...

27:42.762 --> 27:44.163
- We need to call the
Sheriff right away.

27:44.196 --> 27:45.664
Where's the phone?

27:45.698 --> 27:46.899
- It's right here.

27:51.270 --> 27:52.371
I can't get a dial tone.

27:52.404 --> 27:54.106
- Tap it a few times.

27:54.140 --> 27:55.441
(dial tone buzzing)
Anything?

27:55.474 --> 27:56.308
- Yeah.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.046
- [Operator] 9-1-1.

28:00.079 --> 28:01.280
- Hello?

28:01.313 --> 28:02.214
- [Operator] Do you
have an emergency?

28:02.248 --> 28:04.583
- Hello, yeah, could you please

28:04.616 --> 28:07.619
come to the Reese residence
on Maple Drive immediately?

28:07.653 --> 28:09.288
- [Operator] Sir,
are you injured?

28:09.321 --> 28:10.923
- No, it's my parents.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.492
They've both been murdered.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.494
- [Operator] The Sheriff's
Department is on their way.

28:15.527 --> 28:18.464
- Yes, yes, I understand.

28:18.497 --> 28:19.531
- [Operator] They'll
be there shortly.

28:19.565 --> 28:20.399
- Please hurry.

28:22.869 --> 28:25.004
They said that we
should wait outside

28:25.872 --> 28:27.907
and not to touch anything.

28:27.940 --> 28:28.775
- Okay.

28:36.682 --> 28:39.852
- Why don't you go
wait in the car?

28:39.886 --> 28:41.487
- Will you come with me?

28:41.520 --> 28:42.554
I don't want to be alone.

28:42.588 --> 28:44.323
- You'll be safe.

28:44.356 --> 28:45.858
Just lock the door.

28:45.892 --> 28:46.859
I'll be right here.

28:49.395 --> 28:50.229
- Please.

28:51.363 --> 28:52.198
- All right.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.968
We'll be in the car.

28:56.002 --> 28:58.570
(somber music)

29:06.112 --> 29:08.114
(doors close)

29:16.255 --> 29:17.857
- Where is he going?

29:17.890 --> 29:19.158
- I don't know.

29:20.326 --> 29:21.393
- [Aimee] He just
looks like he's out

29:21.427 --> 29:22.628
for an afternoon stroll.

29:23.930 --> 29:28.134
- We all grieve in
different ways, sweetheart.

29:28.167 --> 29:29.201
- This is so evil.

29:32.771 --> 29:36.175
(police sirens alarming)

29:45.117 --> 29:47.786
(ominous music)

29:49.755 --> 29:50.589
- Jones!

29:54.593 --> 29:56.062
When did you guys get here?

29:56.095 --> 29:58.130
- We arrived shortly after
Flint, the Reese's son.

29:58.164 --> 29:59.866
- [Officer] Have
you been inside?

29:59.899 --> 30:01.267
- Yes.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.468
- All right.

30:02.501 --> 30:04.103
Go to the end of
the driveway, okay?

30:04.136 --> 30:05.704
Wait there.

30:05.737 --> 30:06.939
I'm going to need to talk to ya.

30:06.973 --> 30:08.340
- Absolutely.

30:08.374 --> 30:11.043
(ominous music)

30:24.556 --> 30:27.059
(eerie music)

30:39.838 --> 30:40.639
- Aimee.

30:43.142 --> 30:44.343
- What?

30:44.376 --> 30:45.311
- The Sheriff asked
you a question.

30:47.779 --> 30:48.714
- Sorry, Sheriff.

30:50.282 --> 30:51.817
Can we just go home?

30:51.850 --> 30:52.651
- Not yet.

30:55.354 --> 30:56.855
Did they invite many people in?

30:57.957 --> 30:58.991
- Yeah, a few.

30:59.025 --> 31:00.492
Here and there,

31:00.526 --> 31:02.061
but they didn't entertain much.

31:03.062 --> 31:03.896
- Hmmm.

31:05.231 --> 31:07.666
Did they keep cash
stashed around the house?

31:07.699 --> 31:08.534
- No.

31:10.469 --> 31:13.205
- Oh, God, why is
this happening?

31:14.673 --> 31:16.742
I really don't feel well.

31:19.545 --> 31:22.915
- I think I'm done with you
Mrs. Anderson and Flint.

31:25.484 --> 31:27.286
Could you drive him home?

31:27.319 --> 31:28.120
- Of course.

31:28.154 --> 31:28.988
- Thank you.

31:31.357 --> 31:34.626
Honey, can you
drive me home first?

31:34.660 --> 31:36.362
I really need to
check on the kids.

31:36.395 --> 31:37.229
- Absolutely.

31:39.165 --> 31:39.999
- Thank you.

31:43.602 --> 31:46.973
(police radio commotion)

31:56.915 --> 31:59.551
(ominous music)

32:00.486 --> 32:01.353
- I'm good.

32:06.192 --> 32:07.193
I just don't get it.

32:08.327 --> 32:10.963
Nothing about these
murders makes any sense.

32:10.997 --> 32:13.966
I just keep running it
over again and again.

32:18.537 --> 32:19.438
Shirt's un-tucked.

32:21.373 --> 32:23.275
Top few buttons
undone on his shirt.

32:25.044 --> 32:26.745
It's like something
caught his attention

32:26.778 --> 32:29.948
before he could
get fully dressed.

32:29.982 --> 32:31.250
- You know, that
could just be the way

32:31.283 --> 32:32.684
he dressed around the house.

32:34.886 --> 32:35.721
- No.

32:37.756 --> 32:39.391
Reese was an impeccable dresser.

32:40.859 --> 32:41.860
He took pride in it.

32:44.596 --> 32:47.033
There's no marks around
the windows or the doors,

32:48.467 --> 32:51.203
so no one was breaking in
and caught him by surprise.

32:52.804 --> 32:54.373
They either they knew the killer

32:56.008 --> 32:57.876
or let a stranger in willingly.

32:59.511 --> 33:00.979
- Like somebody turned on them.

33:02.314 --> 33:03.149
- Maybe.

33:06.285 --> 33:07.119
Maybe.

33:09.355 --> 33:13.659
By all accounts, Mrs. Reese
was an immaculate housekeeper.

33:13.692 --> 33:15.494
I mean there's
nothing out of place.

33:16.695 --> 33:18.664
Everything neat and
clean and in order.

33:19.798 --> 33:21.067
No signs of struggle.

33:22.034 --> 33:23.835
I just don't get it.

33:25.271 --> 33:26.805
- [Officer] Well, do these
things ever make sense?

33:34.046 --> 33:36.215
(sighing)

33:37.149 --> 33:38.350
- Poor thing.

33:38.384 --> 33:40.052
Tied up with a pair
of her own panty-hose.

33:43.622 --> 33:45.591
You could consider
it a murder suicide.

33:46.992 --> 33:51.830
I mean, they weren't getting
along, hated retirement,

33:52.698 --> 33:54.533
he off's her and kills himself.

33:55.834 --> 33:56.635
- Suicide?

33:59.405 --> 34:00.406
- Doesn't fit though.

34:02.741 --> 34:04.343
Why would he untie her
after he shoots her

34:04.376 --> 34:05.744
and then kill himself?

34:07.813 --> 34:10.349
No one shoots themselves,

34:10.382 --> 34:11.683
cleans up their own blood

34:13.051 --> 34:14.553
before they breathe their last,

34:14.585 --> 34:16.455
I don't care how
ODC they might be.

34:21.293 --> 34:22.960
And where's the gun?

34:22.994 --> 34:23.829
- The .22?

34:24.696 --> 34:27.199
(eerie music)

34:43.549 --> 34:45.984
- Everything's okay.

34:46.016 --> 34:48.520
I'll be back as soon as I can.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.257
You have nothing to fear.

34:51.290 --> 34:52.623
God is with you.

34:54.793 --> 34:55.694
I love you.

34:56.628 --> 34:59.231
(somber music)

35:15.013 --> 35:17.849
(engine rumbling)

35:24.856 --> 35:27.526
(ominous music)

36:00.526 --> 36:01.727
Are you going to be all right?

36:04.430 --> 36:05.264
Flint?

36:09.167 --> 36:09.968
- Yeah.

36:10.001 --> 36:11.503
Thank you.

36:11.537 --> 36:12.738
I'll be fine.

36:12.771 --> 36:14.105
- We'll be praying for you.

36:20.612 --> 36:23.382
(dramatic music)

36:52.143 --> 36:54.980
(tires screeching)

36:55.013 --> 36:57.283
(vomiting)

37:01.520 --> 37:03.755
(coughing)

37:04.823 --> 37:07.559
(dramatic music)

38:32.077 --> 38:32.878
- Mom?

38:33.812 --> 38:34.713
What's wrong?

38:36.615 --> 38:37.716
Where's Dad?

38:37.749 --> 38:39.050
- Your Father's fine.

38:39.084 --> 38:40.952
He had to drive the
Reeses' son home.

38:40.986 --> 38:41.787
- Why?

38:42.688 --> 38:43.522
What happened?

38:44.556 --> 38:46.224
- Something
terrible, sweetheart.

38:47.993 --> 38:49.995
Come here, I'll tell you both.

39:00.539 --> 39:03.909
Tonight, your father and
I found Mr. and Mrs. Reese

39:03.942 --> 39:05.176
dead in their home.

39:06.912 --> 39:08.346
Somebody shot them.

39:08.380 --> 39:09.214
- What?

39:11.182 --> 39:12.150
Who would do that?

39:14.052 --> 39:14.886
- We don't know.

39:17.489 --> 39:19.157
- But they loved us just like--

39:19.190 --> 39:21.092
- They loved us like
you and Dad love us.

39:21.126 --> 39:22.461
- I know.

39:22.494 --> 39:23.328
I'm so sorry.

39:24.463 --> 39:25.931
- [Debbie] They
were so good to us.

39:25.964 --> 39:26.798
- I know.

39:30.201 --> 39:31.336
- [Becky] Can we pray for Dad?

39:31.369 --> 39:32.704
- Of course.

39:37.576 --> 39:38.510
- Dear God,

39:40.546 --> 39:44.082
please bring Dad home safe.
(somber music)

39:44.115 --> 39:46.785
And help us so we will all
be able to go to sleep.

39:47.919 --> 39:50.489
When we wake up, we
won't have any worries.

39:51.890 --> 39:54.693
In Jesus name we pray, amen.

39:54.726 --> 39:55.561
- Amen.

39:56.595 --> 39:59.164
(somber music)

40:08.339 --> 40:09.508
- Hey gang.

40:09.541 --> 40:10.976
- Dad!

40:11.009 --> 40:12.110
- Hey.

40:12.143 --> 40:13.479
You okay?

40:13.512 --> 40:14.312
Yeah?

40:14.345 --> 40:15.581
How's everybody doin'?

40:19.084 --> 40:20.819
You know I was driving
back home,

40:22.821 --> 40:24.723
God put a verse on my heart.

40:24.756 --> 40:27.258
- Can you read it to us, Dad?

40:27.292 --> 40:28.827
- Of course I can, buddy.

40:28.860 --> 40:29.695
I'd love to.

40:33.131 --> 40:35.801
It's from Psalm 46.

40:35.834 --> 40:38.704
It's important that
we remember it,

40:38.737 --> 40:41.072
especially in times like this.

40:41.106 --> 40:42.407
This is what it says,

40:42.440 --> 40:45.376
"God is our place of safety.

40:46.845 --> 40:48.413
"He gives us strength.

40:49.881 --> 40:52.450
"He's always there to help
us in times of trouble.

40:53.819 --> 40:55.487
"The earth may fall apart.

40:56.922 --> 40:59.591
"The mountains may fall
into the middle of the sea,

41:00.458 --> 41:03.394
"but we will not be afraid."

41:06.397 --> 41:07.232
That's beautiful.

41:09.735 --> 41:10.902
I don't know about you guys

41:10.936 --> 41:13.572
but I need a family hug.

41:15.073 --> 41:17.208
Come on, let's get in
here Anderson family.

41:17.242 --> 41:18.143
Come on.

41:18.176 --> 41:19.010
Yeah.

41:20.178 --> 41:21.346
Your Mom and I love
you guys so much.

41:21.379 --> 41:23.782
You are so precious to us.

41:23.815 --> 41:24.716
- [Aimee] Mm-hmm.

41:24.750 --> 41:26.918
- [Albert] Thank you, Lord.

41:26.952 --> 41:29.721
(fire crackling)

41:37.596 --> 41:39.330
- I don't think
I'll ever be able

41:39.364 --> 41:41.900
to think of the Reese's
home in the same way again.

41:43.201 --> 41:44.002
- I know.

41:47.338 --> 41:49.074
It's going to be
difficult, but...

41:51.076 --> 41:53.779
- You can't un-see that
sort of thing, Albert.

41:53.812 --> 41:55.246
It's etched in my heart.

41:55.280 --> 41:56.281
- I know, sweetheart.

41:57.215 --> 41:58.016
I know.

41:59.651 --> 42:01.853
We have to go on.

42:01.887 --> 42:04.155
We have the kids to think about.

42:04.189 --> 42:05.891
God will keep us.

42:07.125 --> 42:08.326
- But that's just it.

42:09.761 --> 42:12.397
Luke and Francine knew
God just like we do.

42:15.667 --> 42:17.035
She taught Sunday school.

42:17.068 --> 42:18.970
She was the daughter
of a minister.

42:19.004 --> 42:20.205
How could something
so terrible--

42:20.238 --> 42:21.707
- Sweetheart, we
have to trust him.

42:23.008 --> 42:23.842
I know,

42:25.010 --> 42:26.878
I know it's hard to
understand right now.

42:28.346 --> 42:30.816
We don't hold all the pieces
and we probably never will,

42:30.849 --> 42:32.550
but Aimee,

42:34.185 --> 42:36.087
God is greater than all of this.

42:38.423 --> 42:42.127
He has the power to deliver
us from any and all fear.

42:44.495 --> 42:45.330
Come here.

42:56.775 --> 42:57.575
- Albert?

42:57.609 --> 42:58.576
- Hmmm?

42:58.610 --> 43:00.045
- Will you go downstairs

43:00.078 --> 43:01.647
and make sure the kitchen
windows are locked,

43:01.680 --> 43:04.249
and then check on
the children again?

43:04.282 --> 43:05.250
Please?

43:05.283 --> 43:06.117
- Okay.

43:08.887 --> 43:09.688
- Thank you.

43:15.260 --> 43:17.929
(ominous music)

43:49.094 --> 43:51.162
(crying)

44:14.686 --> 44:16.822
- I need you, Lord.

44:16.855 --> 44:19.390
Please give me strength, Lord.

44:19.424 --> 44:21.760
Give me strength, I need it.

44:23.228 --> 44:24.830
I need your wisdom.

44:26.264 --> 44:29.735
I need the right
words to say, Lord,

44:29.768 --> 44:31.502
to comfort my family.

44:34.005 --> 44:36.107
To comfort my wife, Lord.

44:38.810 --> 44:40.478
Please, God, please.

44:46.584 --> 44:48.754
(sobbing)

44:50.388 --> 44:53.158
(dramatic music)

45:21.452 --> 45:24.122
(ominous music)

45:35.867 --> 45:38.103
(creaking)

45:43.208 --> 45:44.575
(whooshing)

45:44.609 --> 45:45.743
- Albert! Albert!

45:45.777 --> 45:46.544
Albert, there's
someone in the house!

45:46.577 --> 45:48.013
- What?

45:48.046 --> 45:48.746
- [Aimee] Albert, I think
there's someone in the house!

45:48.780 --> 45:49.747
Wake up!
- Where?

45:49.781 --> 45:50.982
- There, did you
here that noise?

45:51.016 --> 45:51.950
It's downstairs.

45:51.983 --> 45:52.784
- What?

45:52.818 --> 45:54.185
- It's in the hall now!

45:54.219 --> 45:55.353
Can you go check on it?

45:55.386 --> 45:56.187
- Yeah.

45:56.221 --> 45:57.122
- The children, hurry!

45:57.155 --> 45:58.356
- Okay. Okay.
- Albert!

45:58.389 --> 46:00.792
- I'm going, sweetheart, okay.

46:00.826 --> 46:03.494
(ominous music)

46:09.534 --> 46:12.203
(wood creaking)

46:17.508 --> 46:20.345
(furnace buzzing)

46:28.319 --> 46:29.154
- Albert?

46:32.757 --> 46:34.092
Albert.

46:34.125 --> 46:37.028
(foreboding music)

46:41.399 --> 46:42.200
- Sweetheart.

46:42.233 --> 46:43.034
(yelling)

46:43.068 --> 46:44.335
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

46:44.369 --> 46:46.604
Hey. Hey, let go, let go.
- I'm sorry.

46:46.637 --> 46:47.538
- Come on.

46:47.572 --> 46:48.473
- I thought it was someone else.

46:48.506 --> 46:49.407
- It's okay.
- Are you okay?

46:49.440 --> 46:50.808
- I'm fine.

46:50.842 --> 46:52.210
I'm fine, everything's okay.

46:52.243 --> 46:53.044
- Are the kids okay?

46:53.078 --> 46:54.312
- The kids are fine.

46:54.345 --> 46:55.380
- But I know I heard something.

46:55.413 --> 46:56.314
- You did.

46:56.347 --> 46:58.116
You heard the floor creaking.

46:58.149 --> 47:01.119
I can see how that can sound
like someone walking around.

47:01.152 --> 47:01.987
It's okay.

47:02.854 --> 47:04.956
- Oh, thank God it's you.

47:06.091 --> 47:07.092
- It's okay.

47:08.626 --> 47:11.196
Come on, let's get back to bed.

47:14.599 --> 47:15.500
Get in bed.

47:23.741 --> 47:24.809
- Sorry.

47:24.842 --> 47:26.277
- Don't be sorry.

47:28.146 --> 47:29.014
You okay?

47:31.682 --> 47:32.817
- No, I'm not.

47:34.019 --> 47:36.587
I just keep thinking
about Luke and Francine.

47:36.621 --> 47:37.889
- Hmmm.

47:37.923 --> 47:39.524
- What they must
have gone through.

47:39.557 --> 47:40.558
- I know.

47:43.028 --> 47:44.195
- Who is safe?

47:46.597 --> 47:49.034
- You want me to pray for us?

47:49.067 --> 47:49.867
- Okay.

47:49.901 --> 47:50.701
- Yeah?

47:50.735 --> 47:51.569
Come here.

48:01.279 --> 48:02.613
Heavenly Father,

48:04.882 --> 48:07.618
we plead the blood of
Christ, Lord, over my wife,

48:09.988 --> 48:11.622
over our children, Lord,

48:11.656 --> 48:16.327
over our congregation,
over our entire community.

48:16.361 --> 48:17.628
Lord, we need you.

48:19.130 --> 48:21.399
We say, Lord, to this
entire situation,

48:21.432 --> 48:23.034
we say peace be still.

48:25.870 --> 48:28.873
That you still our hearts, Lord,
that you bring peace to us.

48:33.011 --> 48:36.747
We thank you Lord
for these things.

48:36.781 --> 48:39.650
We pray for it,
Lord, in your mighty

48:39.684 --> 48:41.186
and powerful name.

48:43.621 --> 48:44.822
Amen.

48:44.855 --> 48:45.690
- Amen.

48:47.025 --> 48:47.858
Thank you.

48:52.163 --> 48:54.932
(dramatic music)

49:02.107 --> 49:05.043
(muffled dialogue)

49:58.263 --> 50:00.998
(dramatic music)

50:07.138 --> 50:10.075
(muffled dialogue)

51:04.895 --> 51:07.132
- Pastor, everyone's afraid.

51:07.165 --> 51:09.434
They haven't caught
the killer yet.

51:09.467 --> 51:11.236
It could be someone
in this room.

51:11.269 --> 51:13.938
- Yeah, Pastor, it's really
changed the whole town.

51:13.971 --> 51:16.841
I mean, normally everyone's
pretty easy going and laid back.

51:16.874 --> 51:19.677
We don't even lock our
doors or windows at night.

51:19.710 --> 51:21.146
- Yeah, I know.

51:21.179 --> 51:23.648
- Lori has me keeping my
shotgun next to the bed now,

51:23.681 --> 51:25.483
and she hates guns.

51:25.516 --> 51:26.351
- Yeah.

51:27.352 --> 51:28.886
Well, gentlemen,

51:28.919 --> 51:31.256
now I can tell you
firsthand that things are,

51:32.823 --> 51:35.160
that things are
challenging right now.

51:35.193 --> 51:36.026
For all of us.

51:37.228 --> 51:41.065
But we can't forget that
God is still in control.

51:41.098 --> 51:43.434
- Yeah, but Pastor, how
can God let the Reese's

51:43.468 --> 51:45.670
be cut down in cold blood?

51:45.703 --> 51:47.638
- I'm not saying I
understand it, Mike.

51:49.140 --> 51:52.877
The reality is that we live
in a sin drenched world.

51:52.910 --> 51:55.045
There really is an enemy
out there that seeks

51:55.079 --> 51:57.548
to steal, kill, and destroy us.

51:59.150 --> 52:01.219
But if there's one thing I know

52:01.252 --> 52:05.623
is that God can take a
situation even like this one

52:05.656 --> 52:07.558
and make good from it.

52:07.592 --> 52:08.426
Me?

52:09.360 --> 52:10.595
I choose to trust.

52:11.762 --> 52:13.464
I hope you gentlemen
will do the same.

52:17.268 --> 52:18.669
You ready to go, sweetheart?

52:20.171 --> 52:21.872
Have a blessed
afternoon, gentlemen.

52:21.906 --> 52:23.040
- [Men] Thank you, Pastor.

52:26.611 --> 52:28.479
- That is a man of
faith right there.

52:35.720 --> 52:37.188
- [Albert] Go, ahead,
roll, roll, roll.

52:38.289 --> 52:40.225
- Thank you for
making cookies, Mary.

52:40.258 --> 52:41.826
- We thought that
it would be nice.

52:41.859 --> 52:44.128
- Smells great
over there, ladies.

52:44.161 --> 52:46.831
(dice rattling)

52:48.499 --> 52:51.336
(doorbell ringing)

52:51.369 --> 52:52.169
I'll get it.

52:53.404 --> 52:55.072
Here, hold on buddy,
I'll be right back.

52:56.841 --> 52:59.610
Nobody is going to
roll until I get back.

52:59.644 --> 53:00.945
(doorbell ringing)

53:00.978 --> 53:02.380
- We'll be right back.

53:02.413 --> 53:03.248
- Okay.

53:08.886 --> 53:09.687
- Pastor.

53:09.720 --> 53:10.521
- Flint,

53:10.555 --> 53:11.389
come in.

53:12.790 --> 53:13.624
Grace.

53:24.269 --> 53:25.903
- Can I get you
some coffee or tea?

53:25.936 --> 53:27.805
The girls just
made fresh cookies.

53:27.838 --> 53:28.673
- No thank you.

53:29.540 --> 53:30.708
- No.

53:30.741 --> 53:31.576
- Okay.

53:35.380 --> 53:36.881
- So, how are you
two holding up?

53:36.914 --> 53:39.284
- Why did you two leave
the funeral so quickly?

53:39.317 --> 53:43.621
- Well, it was very hard
on us, as you can imagine.

53:45.055 --> 53:47.224
Your parents were becoming
very close friends of ours.

53:47.258 --> 53:49.560
- Did you receive
any money from them?

53:49.594 --> 53:50.428
- Money?

53:51.329 --> 53:52.363
No, of course not.

53:54.432 --> 53:56.033
- How much beef
did they give you?

53:56.967 --> 53:58.102
- I'm sorry?

53:58.135 --> 54:00.371
- Dad told they gave you some.

54:00.405 --> 54:02.640
- Well--
- About half.

54:02.673 --> 54:03.508
- Half a beef?

54:03.541 --> 54:05.042
I don't understand.

54:05.075 --> 54:08.045
- You know how much money the
Crane's got from our parents?

54:08.078 --> 54:10.180
- No, I mean,

54:10.214 --> 54:11.916
we know they loaned
them some to help out,

54:11.949 --> 54:13.518
but we don't know how--

54:13.551 --> 54:14.752
- Exactly.

54:14.785 --> 54:16.253
Everybody was taking
advantage of them,

54:16.287 --> 54:19.123
of their goodness,
and their generosity.

54:19.156 --> 54:20.190
And because of
that they're dead.

54:20.224 --> 54:21.158
- Excuse me?

54:21.191 --> 54:22.593
- What I'm saying

54:22.627 --> 54:25.530
is because of my parents
generous spirit, they're dead!

54:25.563 --> 54:27.231
Somebody in this town
didn't get what they wanted

54:27.264 --> 54:28.098
and they got mad so
they killed them.

54:28.132 --> 54:29.867
- Now hold on, Flint.

54:29.900 --> 54:32.102
You can't go around making
accusations like that.

54:32.136 --> 54:34.572
- I don't know who did it yet

54:34.605 --> 54:35.406
but when I find out--

54:35.440 --> 54:36.741
- Flint!

54:36.774 --> 54:37.908
I think we're done here.

54:37.942 --> 54:38.776
Let's go.

54:42.079 --> 54:44.649
(somber music)

54:47.017 --> 54:47.852
- Oh,

54:49.253 --> 54:50.488
and if somebody borrowed
somethin' from our parents,

54:50.521 --> 54:51.356
we want it back.

54:52.657 --> 54:54.124
Tell them that.

54:54.158 --> 54:55.626
Put that in one of your sermons!

54:55.660 --> 54:56.527
- Come on, Flint.

54:57.428 --> 54:58.228
- I mean it!

55:05.503 --> 55:08.506
(traffic commotion)

55:15.245 --> 55:17.915
(phone ringing)

55:18.849 --> 55:20.217
- Sheriff Tomlin.

55:20.250 --> 55:22.453
- Sheriff, this is Jon
Klaussen over on Willow Drive.

55:22.487 --> 55:25.556
I got to thinking about
this deal with the Reese's.

55:25.590 --> 55:26.791
- Yeah?

55:26.824 --> 55:28.092
- I couldn't get
it out of my mind.

55:28.125 --> 55:29.927
- What do you mean?

55:29.960 --> 55:32.497
- [Man Voiceover] I was
driving to Port Angeles on 101.

55:32.530 --> 55:34.865
I think it was
September 2nd or so.

55:34.899 --> 55:36.834
As I came across a
rise in the road,

55:36.867 --> 55:39.303
just past Stevenson's
tulip farm,

55:39.336 --> 55:41.572
I saw this woman hitch-hiking.

55:41.606 --> 55:43.207
At first, I wasn't gonna stop,

55:43.240 --> 55:45.510
but then I saw she had a baby.

55:46.711 --> 55:48.913
I felt sorry for her,
so I gave her a ride.

55:49.346 --> 55:51.348
- [Man] You need
a ride somewhere?

55:53.250 --> 55:54.485
- [Man Voiceover] I don't
really think a woman

55:54.519 --> 55:56.454
could pull off a murder
like everyone's saying

55:56.487 --> 55:59.390
happened to the Reese's,
but this gal didn't say much

55:59.424 --> 56:01.959
and she didn't seem to
know where she was going.

56:02.827 --> 56:04.294
I kept trying to find out where,

56:04.328 --> 56:06.897
but it just made her
more and more nervous.

56:09.333 --> 56:12.570
We drove through Sequim and
headed toward Port Angeles.

56:12.603 --> 56:15.440
Suddenly she asked me
to stop and let her out.

56:15.473 --> 56:17.742
It was right near the
Dungeness River Bridge.

56:20.044 --> 56:22.780
I said to her, "Why
let you off here?"

56:22.813 --> 56:26.183
And she says, "I'm going to
sleep under the bridge tonight."

56:26.216 --> 56:28.653
I told her, "This was
no place for a baby."

56:29.854 --> 56:31.656
She looked like she was
giving it some thought,

56:31.689 --> 56:34.825
but then she got
out and walked away.

56:36.293 --> 56:40.064
I didn't know how to convince
her otherwise so I drove off.

56:41.732 --> 56:44.201
- That's just a few hundred
yards from the Reese's place.

56:44.234 --> 56:45.936
- Yeah, I know.

56:45.970 --> 56:48.806
- Anything else you can
tell me about the incident?

56:48.839 --> 56:50.741
- I'm afraid that's it, Sheriff.

56:50.775 --> 56:52.276
- All right, John,
I appreciate it.

56:52.309 --> 56:53.544
Appreciate the call.

56:53.578 --> 56:54.779
If there's anything else
you can recall about it,

56:54.812 --> 56:56.947
don't hesitate to
get ahold of me.

56:56.981 --> 56:58.348
- Yeah.

56:58.382 --> 56:59.183
Of course.

56:59.216 --> 57:00.050
- Thanks.

57:01.051 --> 57:03.654
(somber music)

57:09.226 --> 57:11.896
(water rushing)

57:58.042 --> 58:00.978
(crickets chirping)

58:12.056 --> 58:14.391
(knocking)

58:18.062 --> 58:19.263
- Are you expecting someone?

58:19.296 --> 58:20.130
- No.

58:27.371 --> 58:28.573
(groaning)

58:28.606 --> 58:29.506
Bade!

58:29.540 --> 58:30.775
You can't just come in here!

58:30.808 --> 58:31.776
- [Bade] Hey, we're
here to protect you.

58:31.809 --> 58:33.243
- Protect us from what?

58:33.277 --> 58:35.345
- From the murderer, of course!

58:35.379 --> 58:36.714
- [Albert] I don't understand.

58:36.747 --> 58:38.515
- It's like the
newspaper said, Preacher,

58:38.549 --> 58:40.651
it could have been
anyone in town.

58:40.685 --> 58:42.419
You're an important man.

58:42.452 --> 58:43.854
Important enough to protect.

58:45.022 --> 58:45.856
- Are you...

58:47.491 --> 58:48.926
Are you sure about this, Bade?

58:48.959 --> 58:51.461
- Well, that's just it, you
never can never really be sure.

58:51.495 --> 58:53.030
Do you have a metal detector?

58:53.063 --> 58:54.264
- No, we don't.

58:54.298 --> 58:56.533
- Did you ever consider
that the murder weapon

58:56.567 --> 58:58.669
could buried right out
there in your yard?

58:59.870 --> 59:01.105
- Well I...

59:01.138 --> 59:03.340
- You're the only decent
man left in this town.

59:03.373 --> 59:04.875
They already killed Luke Reese.

59:04.909 --> 59:05.910
- Bade, I'm...

59:06.777 --> 59:07.678
I'm concerned.

59:07.712 --> 59:09.246
- Well, you should be concerned.

59:09.279 --> 59:10.715
We're gonna stay the night.

59:10.748 --> 59:12.282
Maybe a couple
nights if we need to.

59:12.316 --> 59:13.117
- Bade, I don't think that's--

59:13.150 --> 59:14.719
- That's great, Bade.

59:14.752 --> 59:15.920
Thank you.

59:15.953 --> 59:17.755
- Yeah, we want to
make sure you're safe.

59:17.788 --> 59:19.256
- Well, we appreciate that.

59:19.289 --> 59:20.825
We're gonna head up to bed now.

59:22.426 --> 59:24.161
Have a good night.

59:24.194 --> 59:25.863
(ominous music)

59:25.896 --> 59:26.797
- Let's settle in.

59:33.838 --> 59:37.007
(somber piano music)

59:40.510 --> 59:42.012
- Debbie.

59:42.046 --> 59:43.213
Sweetheart.

59:43.247 --> 59:44.081
What's wrong?

59:46.416 --> 59:48.719
- Is this what it's gonna
be like from now on?

59:50.320 --> 59:51.656
- [Aimee] What do you mean?

59:53.824 --> 59:54.892
- I'm scared, Mom.

59:57.394 --> 59:59.163
Sometimes I'll stay
up at night wondering

59:59.196 --> 01:00:01.098
if you and Dad are
gonna make it home.

01:00:02.566 --> 01:00:05.035
Wondering if I'm going to
have to become the parent.

01:00:05.069 --> 01:00:06.536
(sobbing)

01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:09.039
- [Aimee] What would make
you think such a thing?

01:00:09.073 --> 01:00:10.975
- I don't know.

01:00:11.008 --> 01:00:13.043
- It's going to be
okay, I promise.

01:00:14.211 --> 01:00:16.413
- Is everything okay up
there, Mrs. Anderson?

01:00:17.715 --> 01:00:19.083
- We're fine up here, Bade.

01:00:21.251 --> 01:00:22.386
- Just checking.

01:00:23.553 --> 01:00:25.522
- It's going to be
all right, okay?

01:00:25.555 --> 01:00:26.390
Come here.

01:00:44.909 --> 01:00:46.043
- Good night.

01:00:51.882 --> 01:00:54.351
- Just so you know,
I'm not okay with this.

01:00:54.384 --> 01:00:56.220
- Well, I'm not
okay with it either.

01:00:56.253 --> 01:00:58.155
- Then why did
you let them stay?

01:00:58.188 --> 01:00:58.989
- Well,

01:01:00.424 --> 01:01:03.393
I thought it would be worse
if I asked them to leave.

01:01:03.427 --> 01:01:06.030
Like telling them that
I didn't trust them.

01:01:06.063 --> 01:01:08.432
- Are you telling me you
trust two men with loaded guns

01:01:08.465 --> 01:01:10.667
and conspiracy theories to
camp out in our living room?

01:01:10.701 --> 01:01:11.936
- No, sweetheart.

01:01:11.969 --> 01:01:14.705
What I'm saying is that
if I asked them to leave

01:01:14.739 --> 01:01:16.606
they may have taken
it the wrong way.

01:01:23.313 --> 01:01:24.514
- What are we going to do?

01:01:25.816 --> 01:01:27.417
- About Bade?

01:01:27.451 --> 01:01:29.019
- About everything.

01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:32.923
I jump at every sound I hear.

01:01:32.957 --> 01:01:34.959
And I have you chasing
every little noise

01:01:34.992 --> 01:01:36.727
throughout the night.

01:01:39.129 --> 01:01:41.031
The whole town is terrified.

01:01:42.499 --> 01:01:44.701
Poor Debbie thinks we
could be killed next.

01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:47.404
- And so does Bade, apparently.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.408
(chuckling)

01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:52.843
- How can you make
jokes right now?

01:01:52.877 --> 01:01:54.611
- I'm sorry.

01:01:54.644 --> 01:01:56.847
But I'm, I'm sorry,
you're right.

01:02:00.684 --> 01:02:02.286
What?

01:02:02.319 --> 01:02:05.289
- You don't think
Bade has something to
do with this do you?

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:08.225
- I can't say that
I haven't wondered

01:02:08.258 --> 01:02:09.927
about a few people but--

01:02:10.828 --> 01:02:11.962
- But what?

01:02:11.996 --> 01:02:14.664
- But we can't go jumping
to conclusions out of fear.

01:02:14.698 --> 01:02:17.367
And I'm not just talking
about you and the kids.

01:02:17.401 --> 01:02:20.370
You know, it's like you said,
this whole town is paralyzed.

01:02:27.077 --> 01:02:28.312
- You're right.

01:02:32.116 --> 01:02:34.718
I feel like I should have so
much more faith than this.

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:36.220
- Oh, no, no.

01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:38.222
Don't go doing that
to yourself, okay?

01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:40.624
- I wish this never happened.

01:02:40.657 --> 01:02:41.491
- I know.

01:02:44.528 --> 01:02:46.330
I'll tell you what,

01:02:46.363 --> 01:02:48.298
I'll ask them to
leave at first-light

01:02:48.332 --> 01:02:51.101
and let them know
that we appreciate it,

01:02:51.135 --> 01:02:54.071
but that we've got it
covered from here on out.

01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:54.905
Hmmm?

01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:59.209
I'll even put in a few extra
locks for good measure.

01:03:00.544 --> 01:03:01.345
Okay?

01:03:02.346 --> 01:03:03.180
- Okay.

01:03:04.648 --> 01:03:05.615
(sighing)

01:03:05.649 --> 01:03:07.184
I just wish they
would leave now.

01:03:07.217 --> 01:03:08.552
- I know.

01:03:08.585 --> 01:03:10.720
They'll be gone soon enough.

01:03:10.754 --> 01:03:13.157
Come on, let's try
and get some sleep.

01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:14.024
- Okay.

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:17.361
- I love you.

01:03:17.394 --> 01:03:18.896
- I love you too.

01:03:21.231 --> 01:03:22.666
- I'm right here.

01:03:30.307 --> 01:03:33.043
(pleasant music)

01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:38.508
(somber music)

01:05:06.003 --> 01:05:08.338
(knocking)

01:05:11.075 --> 01:05:12.142
Bade?

01:05:12.176 --> 01:05:12.977
- Why'd you do it?

01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:13.810
- Do what?

01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:15.579
- Call the Sheriff!

01:05:15.612 --> 01:05:17.181
All we were doing is
trying to help ya',

01:05:17.214 --> 01:05:18.115
trying to protect ya'.

01:05:18.148 --> 01:05:19.283
- We did no such thing, Bade.

01:05:19.316 --> 01:05:21.318
- Well why'd the
Sheriff come around then

01:05:21.351 --> 01:05:22.953
asking all kinds of
questions about the Reese's?

01:05:22.987 --> 01:05:24.121
- Well, I don't know.

01:05:24.154 --> 01:05:25.889
I mean they're
talking to everyone.

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:27.391
- But it seemed to happen

01:05:27.424 --> 01:05:30.160
just after we come over
to protect you that night.

01:05:30.194 --> 01:05:32.396
You expect me to believe
that's just a conscience?

01:05:32.429 --> 01:05:33.263
- No.

01:05:34.198 --> 01:05:34.965
- Then you did it.

01:05:34.999 --> 01:05:36.466
- What, no, look,

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:40.504
all I'm saying is that they're
talking to everyone, Bade.

01:05:40.537 --> 01:05:41.905
- I warned you.

01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:43.373
- Warned me about what?

01:05:43.407 --> 01:05:45.075
- I warned you that you might
regret getting to know us.

01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:46.710
Well, that time has come.

01:05:46.743 --> 01:05:48.245
- What are you
going to do, Bade?

01:05:48.278 --> 01:05:50.780
- I'm, gonna tell your
supervisor, that's what.

01:05:50.814 --> 01:05:53.950
Wait till he hears how you've
been treating your flock!

01:05:53.984 --> 01:05:56.286
- Well, you have every
right to do that, Bade.

01:05:57.454 --> 01:05:58.255
But know this--

01:05:58.288 --> 01:05:59.756
- But what?

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:02.392
- I'm going to keep praying
for you, and your family.

01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:06.530
(ominous music)

01:06:08.198 --> 01:06:11.635
(truck engine rumbling)

01:06:15.539 --> 01:06:18.442
- Francine Reese was
not the kind of woman

01:06:18.475 --> 01:06:20.810
to turn away a
woman with a baby.

01:06:20.844 --> 01:06:22.912
I'm thinking this
deranged woman got up,

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:27.351
went to the Reese house for
some food or a hand-out.

01:06:27.384 --> 01:06:30.854
And if she had a gun she
could have ordered Francine

01:06:30.887 --> 01:06:32.389
into submission and bound her.

01:06:33.557 --> 01:06:35.759
And if you really
think about it,

01:06:35.792 --> 01:06:38.028
this is just the size of pistol

01:06:38.062 --> 01:06:40.230
a woman would carry.

01:06:40.264 --> 01:06:41.898
- What about Mr. Reese?

01:06:41.931 --> 01:06:43.867
How would he fit
into this scenario?

01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:46.103
- His son told me that
Luke liked to go out

01:06:46.136 --> 01:06:47.737
on the family properties
in the morning

01:06:47.771 --> 01:06:48.805
to work all day long.

01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:50.674
He'd come back midday for lunch.

01:06:52.109 --> 01:06:55.145
So, maybe she surprised him
when he came to the door

01:06:55.179 --> 01:06:56.280
to change his clothes.

01:06:57.514 --> 01:06:59.483
And if you really
think about it,

01:06:59.516 --> 01:07:01.718
a psychotic woman
might be more likely

01:07:01.751 --> 01:07:05.189
to untie the bonds after
shooting Mrs. Reese

01:07:05.222 --> 01:07:08.492
and might be more likely
to clean up the blood.

01:07:09.626 --> 01:07:12.229
Put out an APB on
every detail we have.

01:07:13.197 --> 01:07:17.234
Maybe someone will remember
this hitch-hiking baby woman.

01:07:17.267 --> 01:07:18.068
- You got it.

01:07:22.406 --> 01:07:23.840
- All right, I understand,

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:25.642
but as soon as you find out
about that call me back, thanks.

01:07:27.344 --> 01:07:28.245
- She's clean.

01:07:28.278 --> 01:07:29.479
- What?

01:07:29.513 --> 01:07:30.747
- She admits to
being in the area

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:32.182
and even sleeping
under the bridge,

01:07:33.083 --> 01:07:34.584
but she didn't murder anybody.

01:07:35.819 --> 01:07:38.054
She was up at dawn,
on the road and seen

01:07:38.088 --> 01:07:39.756
a hundred miles away from there.

01:07:41.225 --> 01:07:43.026
She might be mentally challenged

01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:45.061
but completely harmless.

01:07:45.095 --> 01:07:46.996
We're back to square one!

01:07:54.804 --> 01:07:56.473
(thudding)

01:07:56.506 --> 01:07:59.609
(Sheriff grunting)

01:07:59.643 --> 01:08:01.311
- Undersheriff Jannsen?

01:08:01.345 --> 01:08:02.912
- Now is not a good time.

01:08:02.946 --> 01:08:06.316
- Well, I thought you should
know my dad's .357 is missing.

01:08:06.350 --> 01:08:07.251
- Flint!

01:08:07.284 --> 01:08:08.585
I'm sorry, what did you say?

01:08:09.986 --> 01:08:12.456
- Well, my sister was doing
inventory up at my parents place

01:08:12.489 --> 01:08:14.824
and my dad's .357 is missing.

01:08:14.858 --> 01:08:17.026
He always kept it in
a shelf in the closet.

01:08:17.926 --> 01:08:19.529
Here.

01:08:19.563 --> 01:08:21.265
Here's the make
and serial number.

01:08:24.301 --> 01:08:26.603
- Your parents were
killed with a .22 though.

01:08:26.636 --> 01:08:28.104
- Yeah, I know, it
doesn't make any sense,

01:08:28.138 --> 01:08:30.374
but still, I thought
you should know.

01:08:30.407 --> 01:08:31.241
- Thanks, Flint.

01:08:34.211 --> 01:08:36.145
Here's what we're going to do.

01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:38.182
We're going to run
the gun as stolen

01:08:38.215 --> 01:08:39.483
if you're okay with that.

01:08:41.017 --> 01:08:42.452
- Yeah.

01:08:42.486 --> 01:08:45.154
- Get me a signed
stolen report for that.

01:08:46.923 --> 01:08:48.358
And call the FBI.

01:08:48.392 --> 01:08:51.461
I want to know if
anyone has ran that gun.

01:08:54.798 --> 01:08:56.265
Oh,

01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:58.167
and get ahold of the ATF
and have them run the gun

01:08:58.202 --> 01:08:59.703
through E-Trace.

01:08:59.736 --> 01:09:03.707
Maybe someone pawned or sold
the gun for some extra cash.

01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:06.276
Okay, let's get this
case moving again!

01:09:06.310 --> 01:09:07.344
- Fill this out here.

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:12.482
- Well, I'm assuming this
isn't a social visit.

01:09:12.515 --> 01:09:14.818
Do you have more
questions for us?

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:16.620
- How well do you
know Bade Blake?

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:21.124
- Well, he's a, he's a
member of the congregation.

01:09:21.157 --> 01:09:23.893
You might think this
is ridiculous, but I,

01:09:23.926 --> 01:09:27.430
I let him and his grandson
stand guard a few nights back.

01:09:27.464 --> 01:09:28.564
- You did?

01:09:28.598 --> 01:09:29.399
How?

01:09:29.433 --> 01:09:30.500
- With their shotguns.

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:31.801
- Right here, in fact.

01:09:31.835 --> 01:09:32.669
- Why?

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:34.671
- Well, to be honest

01:09:34.703 --> 01:09:36.506
I felt that it was
safer to let them stay

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:38.608
than insist that they leave.

01:09:38.642 --> 01:09:39.776
- Hmmm.

01:09:39.809 --> 01:09:41.478
- Bade isn't a suspect
is he, Sheriff?

01:09:44.581 --> 01:09:45.982
- No.

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:46.850
He's not.

01:09:48.285 --> 01:09:50.287
But I wouldn't recommend him

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:52.656
guarding your home
anymore though.

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:54.057
- Why?

01:09:54.090 --> 01:09:57.261
- He's a diagnosed
schizophrenic with a record.

01:09:59.128 --> 01:09:59.963
- Really?

01:10:01.097 --> 01:10:03.467
Well, we've had a
falling out since, so.

01:10:04.834 --> 01:10:05.802
- Is he harassing you?

01:10:05.835 --> 01:10:07.003
- No.

01:10:07.036 --> 01:10:08.772
No, no, nothing
like that, Sheriff.

01:10:08.805 --> 01:10:10.607
He's all bark.

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.309
He's got a good heart.

01:10:12.342 --> 01:10:13.943
- I'll keep an extra
patrol in your neighborhood

01:10:13.977 --> 01:10:15.512
just in case though.

01:10:15.545 --> 01:10:16.746
- Thank you.

01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:18.315
- Mm-hmm, yeah, we
appreciate that.

01:10:18.348 --> 01:10:21.285
- You know, we're still
questioning a lot of people.

01:10:21.318 --> 01:10:23.353
Friends of the Reese's.

01:10:23.387 --> 01:10:25.289
We know that Mrs. Reese

01:10:25.322 --> 01:10:27.357
counseled a lot of people
within the church, so we--

01:10:27.391 --> 01:10:30.294
- [Albert] Everyone
is still a suspect.

01:10:30.327 --> 01:10:31.428
- Whoever it was,

01:10:32.429 --> 01:10:33.997
it wasn't just a double murder.

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:37.401
It was a double execution.

01:10:37.434 --> 01:10:40.003
Someone with a
seared conscience.

01:10:42.739 --> 01:10:43.540
I'm sorry.

01:10:44.541 --> 01:10:46.576
I didn't mean to upset you.

01:10:47.644 --> 01:10:49.212
Thank you for the coffee, ma'am.

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:53.617
- [Albert] Thank you
for coming by, Sheriff.

01:10:53.650 --> 01:10:54.451
- Absolutely.

01:10:56.353 --> 01:10:57.287
- [Aimee] Sheriff?

01:10:57.321 --> 01:10:58.822
- Yes, Mrs. Anderson?

01:10:58.855 --> 01:11:01.157
- Never mind, it's
probably nothing.

01:11:02.426 --> 01:11:03.693
- Well, hold on a second.

01:11:05.028 --> 01:11:07.196
In a case like this,
nothing could be something.

01:11:07.230 --> 01:11:08.097
What is it?

01:11:09.232 --> 01:11:10.066
Well...

01:11:14.404 --> 01:11:16.573
Have you been by the
Crane residence yet?

01:11:19.142 --> 01:11:19.976
- No, I haven't.

01:11:21.945 --> 01:11:22.779
Why?

01:11:25.014 --> 01:11:26.783
- Well, right around
the time of the murders,

01:11:26.816 --> 01:11:28.652
Faye called Francine.

01:11:28.685 --> 01:11:30.854
All Francine said was,
"I can't talk right now.

01:11:30.887 --> 01:11:33.156
"I've got to go and
be with my Lord."

01:11:33.189 --> 01:11:34.624
- Faye Crane.

01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:37.727
What else?

01:11:37.761 --> 01:11:39.863
- You don't think that has
anything to do with it do you?

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:42.131
- It might.

01:11:43.533 --> 01:11:44.668
Anything else?

01:11:45.935 --> 01:11:48.838
- After Faye's friend
Caroline passed away,

01:11:48.872 --> 01:11:51.307
Faye had a vision that
two more people would die.

01:11:52.742 --> 01:11:55.479
She was so upset she didn't
even go to the funeral.

01:11:55.512 --> 01:11:56.446
Remember?

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:57.381
- [Albert] I do, Sweetheart.

01:11:59.583 --> 01:12:00.350
- Okay.

01:12:02.251 --> 01:12:03.920
Is that it?

01:12:03.953 --> 01:12:06.790
That's all I can
think of for now,

01:12:06.823 --> 01:12:10.193
but we'll call you if
there's anything else.

01:12:10.226 --> 01:12:11.060
- Very good.

01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:12.996
Thank you.

01:12:14.798 --> 01:12:15.865
- We'll see you out.

01:12:15.899 --> 01:12:16.900
- Okay.

01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:28.945
Listen, a friend of mine
goes to your church.

01:12:28.978 --> 01:12:31.815
I can see if he can't
loan you a gun or two.

01:12:31.848 --> 01:12:33.683
You can never be too careful.

01:12:33.717 --> 01:12:35.719
- Well, I don't know how
comfortable I feel about that,

01:12:35.752 --> 01:12:39.989
but given the
circumstances, thank you.

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:41.691
- You're welcome.

01:12:42.692 --> 01:12:43.593
- Have a good day.

01:12:49.533 --> 01:12:52.301
What do you say
we grab the kids,

01:12:52.335 --> 01:12:53.603
pile them into the van,

01:12:54.804 --> 01:12:56.740
go for a drive and
get some fresh air?

01:12:57.974 --> 01:12:58.842
- Okay.

01:12:58.875 --> 01:13:01.611
(pleasant music)

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:39.749
- Not too far now.

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:44.454
I love this place.

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:47.691
- I still can't
believe the Sheriff

01:13:47.724 --> 01:13:50.927
isn't any closer to solving
this than he was two weeks ago.

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.497
- Well, these things
take time, sweetheart.

01:13:53.530 --> 01:13:55.599
- I just feel like if they
could find out who did this

01:13:55.632 --> 01:13:57.200
I could be myself again.

01:13:58.602 --> 01:14:00.604
I wouldn't have to
be afraid any more.

01:14:00.637 --> 01:14:03.306
- But that's not how God works.

01:14:03.339 --> 01:14:04.841
That wouldn't be faith at all.

01:14:05.942 --> 01:14:07.243
- What do you mean?

01:14:07.276 --> 01:14:09.979
- Well, we live in fear
because of the unknown.

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:14.818
So we fill in the blanks
and we "fear" the worst.

01:14:17.386 --> 01:14:18.788
- Our friends are murdered.

01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:22.158
How can we not be afraid?

01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:27.664
You heard the sheriff,
these were executions.

01:14:27.697 --> 01:14:29.533
Whoever did this
can do this again.

01:14:29.566 --> 01:14:31.034
- I know.

01:14:31.067 --> 01:14:32.836
I know, sweetheart,

01:14:32.869 --> 01:14:34.738
but God asks us to trust him,

01:14:34.771 --> 01:14:37.473
to deliver us in the
middle of the fear,

01:14:37.507 --> 01:14:38.975
in the middle of the unknown.

01:14:40.544 --> 01:14:43.980
Think about Daniel when
he was in the lion's den.

01:14:44.013 --> 01:14:48.918
He faced some very real
furry and sharp fanged fears.

01:14:48.952 --> 01:14:51.387
But he prayed and he trusted

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:53.723
while he was
surrounded by his fear.

01:14:55.058 --> 01:14:56.960
And he came out all
the better for it.

01:15:03.366 --> 01:15:05.401
- [Mary] Look, we found
a fuzzy caterpillar.

01:15:05.434 --> 01:15:06.970
- A caterpillar?

01:15:07.003 --> 01:15:08.304
Well, I want to see that.

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:11.507
(Albert chuckling)

01:15:11.541 --> 01:15:14.377
(pleasant music)

01:15:41.805 --> 01:15:42.772
- What are you
doing here, Sheriff?

01:15:42.806 --> 01:15:44.641
Did you come to harass me again?

01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:48.277
- Bade, we need to talk.

01:15:48.311 --> 01:15:49.512
- So talk.

01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:51.514
- I need you to leave
the Andersons alone.

01:15:52.749 --> 01:15:54.483
Don't go near their home.

01:15:54.517 --> 01:15:55.919
Don't call 'em.

01:15:55.952 --> 01:15:57.987
Just stay away, got it?

01:15:58.021 --> 01:15:58.955
- Yeah, I got it.

01:16:05.261 --> 01:16:08.064
Oh, I understand perfectly.
(ominous music)

01:16:08.097 --> 01:16:09.933
I'm sorry, Sheriff.

01:16:09.966 --> 01:16:12.268
I don't know why I did
that, Sheriff, I'm sorry.

01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:13.870
Really, Sheriff, I'm sorry.

01:16:14.971 --> 01:16:16.405
I apologize, forgive me.

01:16:18.074 --> 01:16:19.242
- Turn around.

01:16:22.178 --> 01:16:23.579
It's okay, man.

01:16:23.613 --> 01:16:26.149
(handcuffs clicking)

01:16:26.182 --> 01:16:28.584
We're gonna get you
some help, buddy.

01:16:28.618 --> 01:16:29.518
Okay?

01:16:29.552 --> 01:16:30.453
- [Bade] I'm sorry, Sheriff.

01:16:30.486 --> 01:16:32.588
- It's all right, let's go.

01:16:35.792 --> 01:16:38.094
- [Chris] Albert,
we're all in agreement.

01:16:38.127 --> 01:16:39.228
You need to do more.

01:16:43.633 --> 01:16:45.835
- Well, what do you
propose I do, gentlemen?

01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:48.672
I've given sermons.

01:16:49.605 --> 01:16:50.974
We've had prayer meetings.

01:16:51.007 --> 01:16:52.441
We've denounced the enemy.

01:16:53.409 --> 01:16:54.678
When it comes right down to it,

01:16:54.711 --> 01:16:57.546
it's about people
and their choices.

01:16:57.580 --> 01:16:59.315
Now I can lead them
to the water,

01:16:59.348 --> 01:17:01.751
but it's up to them to drink it.

01:17:01.785 --> 01:17:02.986
- Well--

01:17:03.019 --> 01:17:03.920
- And the Sheriff
is doing everything

01:17:03.953 --> 01:17:05.989
that he can to solve this.

01:17:06.022 --> 01:17:09.859
Now, I'm sorry but I really
don't know what more I can do.

01:17:09.893 --> 01:17:11.795
(knocking)

01:17:11.828 --> 01:17:13.863
- I'm so sorry to
interrupt, gentlemen.

01:17:13.897 --> 01:17:16.733
I have Sheriff Tomlin on the
line asking for you, Pastor.

01:17:16.766 --> 01:17:18.001
- You mind taking a message?

01:17:18.034 --> 01:17:19.969
- I tried, but he
says it's urgent.

01:17:20.003 --> 01:17:21.204
- Okay, I'll take it.

01:17:21.237 --> 01:17:22.739
- Thank you, he's on line two.

01:17:23.606 --> 01:17:24.774
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

01:17:27.877 --> 01:17:29.345
Sheriff, how can I help you?

01:17:29.378 --> 01:17:30.880
- [Sheriff On Phone] I'm
at the Crane residence.

01:17:30.914 --> 01:17:32.949
Can you and your wife
come and drive Faye Crane

01:17:32.982 --> 01:17:34.450
to the psychiatric hospital?

01:17:34.483 --> 01:17:36.385
She's having a breakdown

01:17:36.419 --> 01:17:38.654
and says she won't
go without your wife.

01:17:38.688 --> 01:17:39.823
- [Albert] I understand.

01:17:39.856 --> 01:17:41.024
- [Sheriff On Phone] As
soon as you can get here.

01:17:41.057 --> 01:17:41.858
- Of course.

01:17:41.891 --> 01:17:42.792
We'll be right there.

01:17:42.826 --> 01:17:44.660
- [Sheriff On Phone] Thank you.

01:17:44.694 --> 01:17:46.329
- Albert, what was that about?

01:17:46.362 --> 01:17:49.265
- Aimee and I have to drive
one of our church members

01:17:49.298 --> 01:17:51.567
to the psychiatric
hospital for evaluation.

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.903
- Now that's exactly
what we're talking about.

01:17:55.271 --> 01:17:57.040
This is getting out of hand.

01:17:57.073 --> 01:17:59.475
One of our congregants
is being committed

01:17:59.508 --> 01:18:01.044
to a mental institution?

01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:08.351
- If you'll excuse
me, gentlemen.

01:18:16.125 --> 01:18:17.026
Hey, gang.

01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:17.927
Everybody have a good day?

01:18:17.961 --> 01:18:19.128
- Yeah.

01:18:19.162 --> 01:18:20.063
- I thought you had
a board meeting.

01:18:20.096 --> 01:18:21.564
- I did, something's come up.

01:18:21.597 --> 01:18:23.532
You wanna grab a sweater,
I'll explain on the way?

01:18:23.566 --> 01:18:24.567
- Okay, Becky,
can you say grace?

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:25.969
- [Becky] Yeah.

01:18:26.002 --> 01:18:26.903
- Debbie, you mind
taking over for your mom?

01:18:26.936 --> 01:18:27.871
- Sure, don't worry about us.

01:18:27.904 --> 01:18:28.905
Love you, Dad.
- Love you guys.

01:18:28.938 --> 01:18:29.773
- Bye, Mom, love you.

01:18:32.976 --> 01:18:34.410
- I should have
seen this coming.

01:18:34.443 --> 01:18:35.845
- What do you mean?

01:18:35.879 --> 01:18:38.014
- After Sheriff Tomlin's
visit she called me.

01:18:38.047 --> 01:18:40.049
She said she thought her
husband was the murderer.

01:18:40.083 --> 01:18:41.650
- That doesn't make any sense.

01:18:41.684 --> 01:18:43.152
- I know.

01:18:43.186 --> 01:18:46.189
I assumed it was her
exhaustion talking.

01:18:47.356 --> 01:18:49.625
She asked me to pray
for her and I did.

01:18:50.794 --> 01:18:52.862
I thought she'd be
okay after that.

01:18:52.896 --> 01:18:55.765
- Well, we'll do
whatever we can for them.

01:18:58.101 --> 01:18:59.903
- I can't believe
it's come to this.

01:19:00.703 --> 01:19:03.439
(ominous music)

01:19:10.279 --> 01:19:11.114
- Aimee!

01:19:14.117 --> 01:19:16.052
Don't let them take, don't
take me to the hospital!

01:19:16.085 --> 01:19:17.954
Not in the back of that
car like a criminal!

01:19:17.987 --> 01:19:19.522
Not get in the back of that car!

01:19:19.555 --> 01:19:20.623
Don't you touch me!
- Aimee, bring her here.

01:19:20.656 --> 01:19:21.925
- Don't you touch me!

01:19:21.958 --> 01:19:22.758
Don't you trust him!

01:19:22.792 --> 01:19:23.827
Don't you trust him!

01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:24.894
Don't trust him!

01:19:24.928 --> 01:19:26.629
I know everything about it!

01:19:26.662 --> 01:19:28.631
I know everything about it!

01:19:28.664 --> 01:19:31.767
(dramatic music)

01:19:31.801 --> 01:19:34.737
(muffled yelling)

01:19:40.944 --> 01:19:43.379
(sniffling)

01:19:44.413 --> 01:19:46.249
- You all right, Rob?

01:19:47.483 --> 01:19:48.852
- It's been tough.

01:19:48.885 --> 01:19:50.486
- [Albert] Yeah, I can imagine.

01:19:52.221 --> 01:19:53.957
- We'll be right behind you.

01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:56.425
Hit your flashers if
you need any help.

01:19:56.459 --> 01:19:57.560
Okay?

01:19:57.593 --> 01:19:59.062
- [Albert] We'll meet you there.

01:20:00.496 --> 01:20:03.166
(ominous music)

01:20:18.047 --> 01:20:19.782
- I know who committed
the murderers.

01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:20.984
I know who did it.

01:20:21.017 --> 01:20:21.784
- I know, Faye, you
already told me.

01:20:21.817 --> 01:20:22.818
- No, no, no, no, no!

01:20:22.852 --> 01:20:24.287
The Psychiatrist!

01:20:25.154 --> 01:20:26.923
And my husband's in on it.

01:20:26.956 --> 01:20:29.058
- [Albert] Aimee, Faye,
the doctor's here.

01:20:37.733 --> 01:20:40.703
- Do not touch me,
do not touch me.

01:20:43.973 --> 01:20:45.641
- Mrs. Crane, I'm
Doctor Barrett.

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:47.443
I'm going to ask
you some questions.

01:20:48.611 --> 01:20:50.213
How long did it take
you to get here?

01:20:53.182 --> 01:20:54.984
How long do you
think you'll be here?

01:20:59.288 --> 01:21:00.556
- I know what you did.

01:21:02.291 --> 01:21:03.592
And I know what you did.

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:06.129
And I know what you
did, and you did,

01:21:06.162 --> 01:21:07.596
and you did, and you did.

01:21:07.630 --> 01:21:09.198
- Mrs. Crane, are you going
to cooperate peacefully

01:21:09.232 --> 01:21:10.466
or do I need to get
some help in here?

01:21:10.499 --> 01:21:11.667
- Oh, you know what?

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:13.970
You're just a horrible,
horrible little man!

01:21:14.003 --> 01:21:16.605
Horrible people, don't
shake your head at me!

01:21:16.639 --> 01:21:19.642
"She's a dim wit, little num,
num, little stupid head."

01:21:19.675 --> 01:21:21.844
You know what?! I know! Okay?!

01:21:21.877 --> 01:21:23.412
You think you're soooo smart

01:21:23.446 --> 01:21:25.748
like you pulled one
over on me, but I know.

01:21:25.781 --> 01:21:27.216
No, I know!
(alarm buzzing)

01:21:27.250 --> 01:21:28.817
You're not gonna
get away with this!

01:21:28.851 --> 01:21:30.053
Don't you touch me!

01:21:30.086 --> 01:21:31.020
You're not going to get
away with this either.

01:21:31.054 --> 01:21:33.289
No. No. No. No. No. No.

01:21:33.322 --> 01:21:34.490
No, don't. Don't. Don't. Don't.

01:21:34.523 --> 01:21:35.324
Please.

01:21:35.358 --> 01:21:36.692
No. No. No. No.

01:21:36.725 --> 01:21:38.161
Don't touch me!

01:21:38.194 --> 01:21:39.862
Don't touch me! Don't
touch me! Don't touch me!

01:21:39.895 --> 01:21:40.796
I know you know the truth!

01:21:40.829 --> 01:21:42.065
I know you know the truth!

01:21:42.098 --> 01:21:44.934
I know you see it
too, you feel it!

01:21:48.771 --> 01:21:50.306
The truth will set her free!

01:21:50.339 --> 01:21:51.807
The truth will set her free!

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.342
Don't touch me!

01:21:53.376 --> 01:21:56.179
(dramatic music)

01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:32.982
- Do you think I could
end up like Faye?

01:22:37.186 --> 01:22:38.554
I can't shake these fears.

01:22:43.192 --> 01:22:44.027
- Sweetheart,

01:22:45.728 --> 01:22:49.265
sometimes God gives us
more than we can handle.

01:22:49.298 --> 01:22:51.234
More than we can
handle on our own.

01:22:52.835 --> 01:22:56.072
It's why He created us
for relationship with Him.

01:22:57.940 --> 01:23:01.610
- But I know Him, and
I know I need Him,

01:23:02.611 --> 01:23:03.779
and I talk to Him,

01:23:05.348 --> 01:23:07.483
but I just feel so trapped.

01:23:12.655 --> 01:23:13.489
- Aimee,

01:23:15.158 --> 01:23:17.460
are you letting the
Lord carry this?

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:21.230
Or are you still trying
to carry it on your own?

01:23:22.431 --> 01:23:23.766
- I don't know.

01:23:26.035 --> 01:23:27.036
- Come here.

01:23:29.004 --> 01:23:29.838
It's okay.

01:23:31.274 --> 01:23:32.108
It's okay.

01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:39.348
(crying)

01:23:42.085 --> 01:23:44.220
Why don't you head home,

01:23:44.253 --> 01:23:45.954
take a nice hot bath,

01:23:45.988 --> 01:23:46.989
try and relax.

01:23:48.224 --> 01:23:50.326
I'll probably be here
all night with Rob.

01:23:51.827 --> 01:23:54.563
I'll get the Sheriff
to give me a ride home.

01:23:54.597 --> 01:23:56.599
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:23:56.632 --> 01:23:57.633
- Just give me a minute.

01:23:57.666 --> 01:23:58.967
- Of course.

01:23:59.001 --> 01:23:59.802
Of course.

01:24:02.638 --> 01:24:03.872
I love you.

01:24:03.906 --> 01:24:05.308
- I love you too.

01:24:09.412 --> 01:24:12.181
(dramatic music)

01:24:13.916 --> 01:24:16.085
(sobbing)

01:24:40.443 --> 01:24:43.579
I'm giving this
all to you Jesus.

01:24:43.612 --> 01:24:44.447
Take it.

01:24:48.484 --> 01:24:51.587
(somber piano music)

01:24:59.728 --> 01:25:01.830
(sobbing)

01:25:12.175 --> 01:25:14.943
(pleasant music)

01:25:39.835 --> 01:25:42.705
(humming tune)

01:25:42.738 --> 01:25:44.173
- Mom, you're humming.

01:25:44.207 --> 01:25:45.174
- I am? I am!

01:25:46.442 --> 01:25:47.310
Debbie!

01:25:47.343 --> 01:25:48.511
It's such a great day!

01:25:48.544 --> 01:25:50.179
- [Debbie] What's going on?

01:25:50.213 --> 01:25:51.680
- Isn't it a great day, Debbie?

01:25:51.714 --> 01:25:53.516
(laughing)

01:25:53.549 --> 01:25:56.385
(pleasant music)

01:26:12.368 --> 01:26:13.636
- What is going on?

01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:15.304
What did I miss?

01:26:16.472 --> 01:26:18.207
- We're dancing for joy, Daddy!

01:26:18.241 --> 01:26:19.442
- You are?!

01:26:19.475 --> 01:26:22.378
Well, I want to
dance for joy too!

01:26:22.411 --> 01:26:23.379
Come on!

01:26:23.412 --> 01:26:25.448
(laughing)

01:26:25.481 --> 01:26:28.317
(pleasant music)

01:26:32.087 --> 01:26:33.656
I love you guys, come here.

01:26:33.689 --> 01:26:34.523
Arrrrr.

01:26:36.592 --> 01:26:38.927
(laughing)

01:26:40.296 --> 01:26:41.830
I love seeing you like this.

01:26:41.864 --> 01:26:43.399
- You're home just in
time to make breakfast.

01:26:43.432 --> 01:26:48.437
- Oh, perfect, yeah.
(laughing)

01:26:49.037 --> 01:26:51.374
(phone ringing)

01:26:54.610 --> 01:26:56.044
- Sheriff Tomlin.

01:26:56.078 --> 01:26:58.947
- Sheriff, this is Detective
Reid over in Bellingham.

01:26:58.981 --> 01:27:00.549
We've got your gun.

01:27:00.583 --> 01:27:01.750
- What?!

01:27:01.784 --> 01:27:03.519
I'm sorry, did I
hear you correctly?

01:27:03.552 --> 01:27:05.921
- We picked it up off
a perp last night.

01:27:05.954 --> 01:27:08.524
I ran the serial through
the NCIC and got a hit.

01:27:10.559 --> 01:27:12.160
- Who is he?

01:27:12.194 --> 01:27:13.729
- Edward Chaney.

01:27:13.762 --> 01:27:15.063
Best we can tell
he's new in town.

01:27:15.097 --> 01:27:17.366
He's working as a tree
planter in Bothel.

01:27:18.701 --> 01:27:21.103
So, last night he
borrows his boss' vehicle

01:27:21.136 --> 01:27:23.105
and ends up in Bellingham
after picking up

01:27:23.138 --> 01:27:24.507
a couple of hitch-hikers.

01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:27.643
Now all of them have a
little bit too much to drink.

01:27:27.676 --> 01:27:29.612
Chaney runs the
car off the road.

01:27:29.645 --> 01:27:32.315
One of our officers
witnessed the whole thing.

01:27:32.348 --> 01:27:33.682
Well the hitch-hikers
are laughing

01:27:33.716 --> 01:27:36.819
and Chaney takes off like a fox.

01:27:36.852 --> 01:27:38.421
Officer Tillman is in pursuit

01:27:38.454 --> 01:27:41.657
and we loose him just
outside of a nature park.

01:27:41.690 --> 01:27:44.993
So, we call in the dogs when
we finally do catch up with him

01:27:45.027 --> 01:27:47.029
he's got the .357
in his possession.

01:27:47.062 --> 01:27:48.531
- Mm-hmm.

01:27:48.564 --> 01:27:50.999
- [Reid] He says he picked it
at a junk yard for ten bucks

01:27:51.033 --> 01:27:53.302
but can't for the life
of him remember where.

01:27:54.269 --> 01:27:55.671
- Of course he doesn't.

01:27:55.704 --> 01:27:56.905
- Oh, and you should also know

01:27:56.939 --> 01:27:58.974
that there's a hold on
him from New York State,

01:27:59.007 --> 01:28:00.242
parole violation.

01:28:00.275 --> 01:28:01.310
- I need to talk to him.

01:28:01.344 --> 01:28:02.578
- Yeah, sure, have at it.

01:28:02.611 --> 01:28:04.212
- Okay, thanks.

01:28:04.246 --> 01:28:06.181
We'll be there first
thing tomorrow morning.

01:28:06.214 --> 01:28:07.316
- [Reid] Okay, see you then.

01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:08.917
- All right, thanks.

01:28:08.951 --> 01:28:09.752
- Well, this is good.

01:28:09.785 --> 01:28:11.153
- I sure hope so.

01:28:14.990 --> 01:28:16.291
(door lock buzzing)

01:28:16.325 --> 01:28:18.226
(door closing)

01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:19.261
Mr. Chaney.

01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:22.164
Sheriff Tomlin.

01:28:22.197 --> 01:28:23.866
Clallam County.

01:28:23.899 --> 01:28:26.369
There's this little
matter of a .357

01:28:26.402 --> 01:28:28.003
found in your possession.

01:28:28.036 --> 01:28:30.339
It was taken from the
scene of a double homicide

01:28:30.373 --> 01:28:31.540
we're investigating.

01:28:31.574 --> 01:28:34.109
- Okay, I don't know
nothing about no murder.

01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:35.243
Like I told all the others,

01:28:35.277 --> 01:28:37.312
I bought the gun second hand--

01:28:37.346 --> 01:28:38.947
- Yeah, that's right.

01:28:38.981 --> 01:28:40.816
From a junk yard, ten bucks.

01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:42.985
Which one?

01:28:44.086 --> 01:28:46.288
- Oh, you know...
(chuckling)

01:28:46.321 --> 01:28:47.656
I just...

01:28:47.690 --> 01:28:49.191
I can't remember.

01:28:49.224 --> 01:28:51.894
- Have you ever been
in Sequim, Mr. Chaney?

01:28:53.028 --> 01:28:57.165
- Look, I came out
here for work, right?

01:28:57.199 --> 01:28:58.367
Fresh start 'n all.

01:28:58.401 --> 01:28:59.702
- And violate the
terms of your parole.

01:28:59.735 --> 01:29:01.404
- No, no, no, okay.

01:29:01.437 --> 01:29:04.807
When you get out of prison,
they want you to re-integrate.

01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:06.842
Best way to do that is
to move someplace new

01:29:06.875 --> 01:29:08.210
and start fresh.

01:29:08.243 --> 01:29:09.077
- I see.

01:29:10.278 --> 01:29:12.715
Can you tell me where you
were on the 2nd of September?

01:29:14.116 --> 01:29:15.017
(laughing)

01:29:15.050 --> 01:29:17.185
- Ain't nobody remembers that.

01:29:17.219 --> 01:29:20.322
- You're a felon in
violation of parole,

01:29:20.355 --> 01:29:21.890
cited for drunk driving,

01:29:23.225 --> 01:29:25.127
property damage,

01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:26.462
resisting arrest

01:29:26.495 --> 01:29:28.130
and in possession of a firearm

01:29:28.163 --> 01:29:29.698
that disappeared in a robbery

01:29:29.732 --> 01:29:32.200
that left two people
brutally murdered.

01:29:33.736 --> 01:29:36.739
I'm having a heck of a time
believing you came out west here

01:29:36.772 --> 01:29:39.007
to turn over a new leaf.

01:29:39.041 --> 01:29:42.144
In fact, I bet a Grand
Jury would have a hard time

01:29:42.177 --> 01:29:43.912
believing that as
well, Mr. Chaney.

01:29:47.850 --> 01:29:49.351
(laughing)

01:29:49.384 --> 01:29:50.819
- You can't prove nothin'

01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:56.525
and I have a one way ticket
back to New York tomorrow, so...

01:30:08.203 --> 01:30:09.104
(door buzzing)

01:30:09.137 --> 01:30:10.506
Oh, you're gonna stay here?

01:30:17.446 --> 01:30:19.114
- Is this your guy?

01:30:20.849 --> 01:30:22.585
- I think so.

01:30:22.618 --> 01:30:25.721
(airplane whooshing)

01:30:26.589 --> 01:30:28.323
(phone ringing)

01:30:28.356 --> 01:30:29.525
- Brady.

01:30:29.558 --> 01:30:31.093
- I'm afraid your
trip was unnecessary.

01:30:31.126 --> 01:30:33.428
I have here, in my hand,
a warrant for Chaney

01:30:33.462 --> 01:30:35.798
from the Clallam County
Prosecutor's office.

01:30:35.831 --> 01:30:38.066
He's a material witness in
a couple of murders cases

01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:40.636
and that supersedes your
extradition order, thanks.

01:30:53.381 --> 01:30:54.216
He's all yours.

01:31:01.023 --> 01:31:03.626
(somber music)

01:31:49.304 --> 01:31:52.374
- Looks like you got
yourself an extended stay.

01:31:52.407 --> 01:31:53.909
It's good though.

01:31:53.942 --> 01:31:55.878
It gave you a few extra
days to think things over.

01:32:00.949 --> 01:32:01.950
I wonder...

01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:08.190
how many of those good people
are gonna have recollections

01:32:08.223 --> 01:32:10.859
of you in their fine town

01:32:10.893 --> 01:32:12.695
after we flash
your photo around.

01:32:14.663 --> 01:32:16.064
And I wonder

01:32:16.098 --> 01:32:19.034
just how forgiving they'll be

01:32:20.135 --> 01:32:21.637
sat down as a panel
of your peers.

01:32:27.610 --> 01:32:30.512
There must be a very
special place reserved

01:32:31.413 --> 01:32:32.214
in Hell

01:32:33.649 --> 01:32:34.783
for someone like that.

01:32:38.787 --> 01:32:40.288
- I didn't murder those people.

01:32:44.059 --> 01:32:46.261
One of my friends that I served
time with back in New York

01:32:46.294 --> 01:32:48.030
moved out here a
couple months ago.

01:32:49.131 --> 01:32:50.766
We planned a camping trip.

01:32:52.134 --> 01:32:56.171
The plan was to break
into people's trailers

01:32:56.204 --> 01:32:58.273
when they was down at the beach.

01:32:58.306 --> 01:33:01.509
We started down on the Oregon
coast and moved our way north.

01:33:03.646 --> 01:33:05.848
Didn't have much luck though.

01:33:05.881 --> 01:33:08.817
We ended up somewhere up here

01:33:08.851 --> 01:33:11.620
before we crossed the
sound and went home.

01:33:11.654 --> 01:33:12.487
- Is that it?

01:33:14.222 --> 01:33:15.824
I said, is that it?

01:33:15.858 --> 01:33:17.059
No more details.

01:33:19.427 --> 01:33:20.929
- If you want more details,

01:33:22.264 --> 01:33:23.331
I want a deal.

01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:28.470
Now I didn't murder those
people but I know who did.

01:33:28.503 --> 01:33:29.337
- Deal?

01:33:31.206 --> 01:33:33.275
I don't make deals
with convicts.

01:33:34.442 --> 01:33:36.845
I have enough on you to
put you away for life.

01:33:38.413 --> 01:33:41.717
You'd be better off just
telling me the rest.

01:33:48.523 --> 01:33:49.424
- You know what?

01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:53.228
You're right.

01:33:55.831 --> 01:33:57.465
You don't make deals.

01:33:59.467 --> 01:34:02.037
The District Attorney
on the other hand,

01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:03.371
they make deals.

01:34:04.807 --> 01:34:07.876
And I'd wonder how they'd
feel about this conversation.

01:34:11.714 --> 01:34:13.949
(thudding)

01:34:15.017 --> 01:34:17.252
(giggling)

01:34:21.556 --> 01:34:22.725
(door buzzing)

01:34:22.758 --> 01:34:24.993
(laughing)

01:34:31.433 --> 01:34:33.501
- Are you sure you guys
are okay with this?

01:34:33.535 --> 01:34:35.203
I just thought you
might want to be here

01:34:35.237 --> 01:34:38.506
and listen to this yourselves.

01:34:38.540 --> 01:34:39.742
- Thank you, Sheriff.

01:34:39.775 --> 01:34:41.176
- [Albert] Yeah,
we appreciate it.

01:34:41.209 --> 01:34:42.210
- All right.

01:34:44.446 --> 01:34:47.115
(door creaking)

01:34:49.151 --> 01:34:51.720
(door buzzing)

01:34:57.860 --> 01:35:00.195
(chuckling)

01:35:06.802 --> 01:35:07.635
- Got a pen?

01:35:30.993 --> 01:35:34.129
I knew that my old cell-mate,
Brian Sanders, and his wife

01:35:34.162 --> 01:35:36.731
were planning on moving
out here once he got out.

01:35:37.933 --> 01:35:41.003
He told me I should hit
him up when I got out.

01:35:41.036 --> 01:35:42.204
So that's what I did.

01:35:44.606 --> 01:35:46.574
(laughing)

01:35:46.608 --> 01:35:48.811
We had a couple of days
off in early September

01:35:48.844 --> 01:35:52.147
and we decided we'd
just go have some fun.

01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:54.082
We were going to rob campers.

01:35:54.116 --> 01:35:56.551
You know, people who
could actually afford

01:35:56.584 --> 01:36:00.655
to be on vacation, but we just,

01:36:00.688 --> 01:36:02.490
we had no luck.

01:36:02.524 --> 01:36:04.426
Apparently, you guys
camp different out here

01:36:04.459 --> 01:36:05.593
than we do back east.

01:36:06.962 --> 01:36:10.866
So, the next day, we
were in Port Angeles area

01:36:10.899 --> 01:36:13.902
and we just started
looking for houses.

01:36:13.936 --> 01:36:15.670
We figured most people
were gonna be gone

01:36:15.703 --> 01:36:16.872
for Labor Day weekend.

01:36:16.905 --> 01:36:21.276
So, we find these
houses at the back end

01:36:21.309 --> 01:36:23.912
of this dead-end
road pretty far out.

01:36:25.047 --> 01:36:27.615
It didn't look like
anyone else was around.

01:36:28.650 --> 01:36:31.186
Brian tells me, stay in the car.

01:36:31.219 --> 01:36:35.223
He grabs his .22, gets out,
and goes up to this house

01:36:35.257 --> 01:36:36.224
to check it out.

01:36:37.492 --> 01:36:39.794
So, he knocks on the door

01:36:39.828 --> 01:36:42.865
and this old lady comes
out and he just shoves her

01:36:42.898 --> 01:36:44.599
right through the doorway.

01:36:44.632 --> 01:36:45.968
I didn't know what to do.

01:36:47.369 --> 01:36:50.973
Suddenly, I hear a
couple of shots go off

01:36:51.006 --> 01:36:54.642
so I got out of the car
and I ran into the house.

01:36:56.578 --> 01:36:57.479
Are you okay?!?

01:36:57.512 --> 01:36:58.813
- I don't want to hear it!

01:36:58.847 --> 01:36:59.647
- Wanna here what?!

01:36:59.681 --> 01:37:00.883
What is going on?!

01:37:00.916 --> 01:37:03.018
- Dude, I was tying her
up, I was gagging her.

01:37:03.051 --> 01:37:04.486
This guy, right here, walks up--

01:37:04.519 --> 01:37:06.121
- And you shot someone?!

01:37:06.154 --> 01:37:07.489
- I had to shoot him!

01:37:07.522 --> 01:37:08.423
- What?!

01:37:08.456 --> 01:37:09.157
Why did you have to shoot him?!

01:37:09.191 --> 01:37:10.292
We need to go!

01:37:10.325 --> 01:37:11.126
Come on, let's go!

01:37:11.159 --> 01:37:12.394
- No! No! No!

01:37:12.427 --> 01:37:13.929
We need to get her
in the room, now.

01:37:13.962 --> 01:37:14.863
- Why do we need to?

01:37:14.897 --> 01:37:16.899
- We need to, let's go, get up!

01:37:16.932 --> 01:37:20.702
(muffled screaming)

01:37:20.735 --> 01:37:24.839
- You know this is a
horrible idea, right?

01:37:24.873 --> 01:37:29.477
No, don't, don't, don't!
(gunshot popping)

01:37:29.511 --> 01:37:32.247
(ominous music)

01:37:37.852 --> 01:37:39.854
(gunshot)

01:37:48.796 --> 01:37:49.631
- Yes!

01:37:50.899 --> 01:37:52.667
There you go buddy.

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:53.668
Now you have one.

01:37:55.337 --> 01:37:56.171
Let's go.

01:37:57.940 --> 01:38:00.575
(ominous music)

01:38:05.447 --> 01:38:08.250
(engine rumbling)

01:38:12.187 --> 01:38:14.089
- And we take off.

01:38:14.122 --> 01:38:16.124
Head back across
the sound and home,

01:38:17.692 --> 01:38:19.427
like nothing had ever happened.

01:38:22.397 --> 01:38:25.000
(somber music)

01:38:26.434 --> 01:38:27.302
- So, is that it?

01:38:29.504 --> 01:38:30.973
- Enough to go to trial.

01:38:32.907 --> 01:38:34.509
We'll see if his story holds up.

01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:38.280
- And there's still so
many unanswered questions.

01:38:40.448 --> 01:38:41.683
- Welcome to my world.

01:38:43.418 --> 01:38:46.188
(dramatic music)

01:38:55.397 --> 01:38:57.799
- Thank you, Sheriff Tomlin.

01:39:12.114 --> 01:39:14.949
(pleasant music)

01:39:56.391 --> 01:39:59.627
(pleasant piano music)

01:40:06.934 --> 01:40:11.673
* When peace like a river

01:40:11.706 --> 01:40:16.478
* Attendeth my way

01:40:16.511 --> 01:40:19.081
* When sorrows

01:40:19.114 --> 01:40:23.851
* Like sea billows roll

01:40:23.885 --> 01:40:28.256
* Whatever my lot

01:40:28.290 --> 01:40:33.261
* Thou hast taught me to say

01:40:33.295 --> 01:40:35.697
* It is well

01:40:35.730 --> 01:40:38.166
* It is well

01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:43.205
* With my soul

01:40:43.871 --> 01:40:48.110
* It is well

01:40:48.143 --> 01:40:53.115
* With my soul

01:40:53.781 --> 01:40:55.650
* It is well

01:40:55.683 --> 01:41:00.622
* It is well with my soul

01:41:03.725 --> 01:41:08.296
* Though Satan should buffet

01:41:08.330 --> 01:41:13.135
* Though trials should come

01:41:13.168 --> 01:41:18.173
* Let this blessed
assurance control *

01:41:20.608 --> 01:41:25.413
* That Christ has regarded

01:41:25.447 --> 01:41:29.751
* My helpless estate

01:41:29.784 --> 01:41:32.019
* And hath shed

01:41:32.053 --> 01:41:34.456
* His own blood

01:41:34.489 --> 01:41:39.394
* For my soul

01:41:39.427 --> 01:41:44.065
* It is well

01:41:44.098 --> 01:41:48.970
* With my soul

01:41:49.003 --> 01:41:53.775
* It is well, it is well

01:41:53.808 --> 01:41:58.780
* With my soul

01:41:59.481 --> 01:42:01.249
* My sin

01:42:01.283 --> 01:42:03.618
* Oh, the bliss

01:42:03.651 --> 01:42:08.656
* Of this glorious thought

01:42:09.291 --> 01:42:10.825
* My sin

01:42:10.858 --> 01:42:13.060
* Not in part

01:42:13.094 --> 01:42:16.398
* But the whole

01:42:16.431 --> 01:42:20.335
* Is nailed to the cross

01:42:20.368 --> 01:42:25.173
* And I bear it no more

01:42:25.207 --> 01:42:27.675
* Praise the Lord

01:42:27.709 --> 01:42:30.144
* Praise the Lord

01:42:30.178 --> 01:42:35.116
* O, my soul

01:42:35.149 --> 01:42:39.987
* It is well

01:42:40.021 --> 01:42:44.792
* With my soul

01:42:44.826 --> 01:42:49.831
* It is well, it is well

01:42:50.465 --> 01:42:55.270
* With my soul

01:42:55.303 --> 01:42:59.140
* And Lord face the day

01:42:59.173 --> 01:43:04.078
* When thy faith shall beside

01:43:04.979 --> 01:43:08.450
* The clouds may roll back

01:43:08.483 --> 01:43:11.586
* As a storm

01:43:11.619 --> 01:43:15.790
* The drum shall resound

01:43:15.823 --> 01:43:20.695
* And the Lord shall descend

01:43:20.728 --> 01:43:23.097
* Even so

01:43:23.130 --> 01:43:25.667
* It is well

01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:30.705
* With my soul

01:43:31.339 --> 01:43:35.677
* It is well

01:43:35.710 --> 01:43:40.415
* With my soul

01:43:40.448 --> 01:43:45.420
* It is well, it is well

01:43:45.453 --> 01:43:49.724
* With my soul
