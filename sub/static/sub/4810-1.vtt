02:01.371 --> 02:03.873
What's your pleasure, Mr. Cotton?

02:05.459 --> 02:07.460
The box.

02:18.555 --> 02:20.890
Take it, it's yours.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.356
It always was.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.648
It's gotta be one of these.

05:57.733 --> 05:59.483
I'm going to freeze to death.

05:59.568 --> 06:02.820
- Okay, okay.
- Well, maybe somebody changed the lock.

06:02.904 --> 06:05.364
Like who?
Who's gonna change this lock?

06:05.449 --> 06:08.034
Well, I don't know.
It was just a suggestion.

06:08.118 --> 06:11.037
Success.

06:11.121 --> 06:13.205
Voila.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.708
Well, this is it...

06:15.792 --> 06:18.919
the old homestead.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.721
Yuck. It smells damp.

06:28.805 --> 06:32.600
Well, it's... been empty
for a while, hasn't it?

06:34.144 --> 06:35.686
But we'll soon warm it up

06:35.771 --> 06:38.981
and get it feeling like a home.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.983
How long since you were here?

06:41.068 --> 06:42.610
Oh, the better part
of 10 years.

06:42.694 --> 06:45.905
I wanted to sell it
after the old lady died,

06:45.989 --> 06:48.032
but I couldn't get
Frank to agree.

06:48.116 --> 06:50.951
I guess he needed
a hideout or something.

06:53.121 --> 06:55.331
Would you look at this?

06:57.209 --> 06:59.085
And don't worry,

06:59.169 --> 07:01.545
this stuff means nothing to me.

07:01.630 --> 07:03.130
It all goes.

07:03.215 --> 07:05.549
I thought half of it
was your brother's.

07:05.634 --> 07:08.552
I've never known him to kick cash
out of bed. Besides...

07:08.637 --> 07:11.305
he's probably
behind bars someplace.

07:11.389 --> 07:14.016
You know...

07:15.519 --> 07:17.561
we have to let
Kirsty see this place

07:17.646 --> 07:19.063
before we do a thing to it.

07:19.147 --> 07:20.981
She'll love it.

07:21.066 --> 07:22.900
You really want
to move in here?

07:22.984 --> 07:24.401
You don't like it?

07:24.486 --> 07:27.196
I suppose it's better
than Brooklyn.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.782
Oh, don't start, Julia.

07:29.866 --> 07:32.451
- Don't start what?
- Look.

07:32.536 --> 07:34.495
We can make it work here.

07:34.579 --> 07:37.081
Now I've got a terrific job,

07:37.165 --> 07:40.334
you're back on your own turf...

07:40.418 --> 07:42.461
we can be happy.

07:42.546 --> 07:45.256
- All right, all right.
- So what's the argument?

07:45.340 --> 07:48.968
- No argument.
- Oh, Christ!

07:49.052 --> 07:50.553
Honey...

07:53.598 --> 07:55.724
Shit.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.390
Larry! Larry!

08:36.474 --> 08:38.976
- Where are you?
- In here.

08:48.069 --> 08:49.570
Squatters?

08:54.826 --> 08:56.160
Frank.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.996
- He's here?
- Well, he's been here.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.998
I mean, there's stuff
in the kitchen you wouldn't believe.

09:01.082 --> 09:04.293
He's obviously made
one of his famous getaways.

09:06.296 --> 09:08.339
What the hell is that?

09:23.730 --> 09:26.857
- Who is this?
- Dad.

09:26.942 --> 09:29.276
- Kirsty!
- I got through.

09:29.361 --> 09:31.779
- Barely . Where are you?
- I found a room.

09:31.863 --> 09:34.907
- You what?
- I said, I found a room.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.367
Wait, I thought
you were going to stay

09:36.451 --> 09:37.910
- with us for a while.
- Dad.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.411
Well, you'd like this house.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.664
You'd like my room.

09:59.057 --> 10:01.141
I'd really like you to see this house.
It's something else.

10:01.226 --> 10:03.894
Maybe in the next couple of days.
I gotta find myself a job.

10:03.979 --> 10:05.688
What for, sweetie?

10:05.772 --> 10:08.774
Look, you've already made the gesture,
there's no need...

10:08.858 --> 10:11.652
Dad, this isn't a gesture.
This is something I need to do.

10:11.736 --> 10:15.197
Come on and trust me
a little, okay?

10:31.798 --> 10:35.676
- Call me tomorrow.
- I will. I'll see you.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.012
Bye, Dad.

11:00.243 --> 11:01.702
So?

11:03.705 --> 11:05.414
Why not?

11:05.498 --> 11:08.167
Great.

11:08.251 --> 11:10.544
We'll move in on Sunday.

11:10.628 --> 11:13.464
Listen, look out for the molding

11:13.548 --> 11:15.299
on the way through here.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.843
- All right.
- All right.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.512
- Are you all right back there?
- Yeah yeah.

11:20.597 --> 11:22.139
All right, okay . Now just take it

11:22.223 --> 11:24.641
straight up the stairs.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.687
Don't worry, it'll get through.

11:28.772 --> 11:31.482
- All right. What's the matter?
- Hey, you got my arm!

11:31.566 --> 11:33.525
- All right, all right.
- Oh, God.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.110
- Watch it.
- Oh.

11:36.654 --> 11:39.198
Let's take five, guys.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.451
How's things in there?

11:42.535 --> 11:45.788
- Looks like a bomb dropped.
- You got any beer?

11:46.790 --> 11:48.457
There's some in the fridge.

11:50.168 --> 11:52.378
Oh, well...

11:52.462 --> 11:55.839
why don't I get it?

11:55.924 --> 11:59.760
I've got nothing better to do.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.369
Excuse me.

13:07.454 --> 13:10.456
- My lucky day.
- Hi.

13:10.540 --> 13:14.376
- Do you wanna buy a bed?
- Not much.

13:14.461 --> 13:15.544
Dad?

13:15.628 --> 13:16.962
- Kirsty!
- Hi.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.964
Hello, sweetie. Come here.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.800
- Here you go.
- Oh, great.

13:21.885 --> 13:23.218
This is a big house.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.804
- You like?
- Yeah.

13:25.889 --> 13:27.389
Me like.

13:27.474 --> 13:30.642
I'll give you the grand tour if we ever
get this goddamn bed moved.

13:30.727 --> 13:33.103
- Is Julia here?
- She's upstairs.

13:33.188 --> 13:35.272
Look, be gentle with her, okay?

13:35.356 --> 13:38.358
- She hates moving.
- Surprise.

13:38.443 --> 13:41.820
- Kirsty.
- Okay, all right. I'll be nice.

13:41.905 --> 13:44.156
You get on with the grunt work

13:44.240 --> 13:46.325
- and I'll make myself some coffee.
- That's a great idea.

13:46.409 --> 13:48.243
- There's the kitchen.
- Okay.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.828
Bye.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.666
Is that your daughter?

13:54.751 --> 13:57.461
- Got her mother's looks.
- Her mother's dead.

14:08.932 --> 14:10.098
Come on.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.271
Oh, shit.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.775
Can I come in?

14:21.361 --> 14:23.195
Can I come in?

14:29.369 --> 14:32.913
- You're Julia, right?
- That's right.

14:32.997 --> 14:35.040
Who are you?

14:36.543 --> 14:38.544
I'm Frank.

14:40.255 --> 14:41.797
I'm brother Brank.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.424
Oh, yes!

14:45.426 --> 14:48.011
I... I came for the wedding.

14:51.182 --> 14:52.641
Well, can I come in or not?

14:52.725 --> 14:56.144
I'm sorry. Of course.

14:59.023 --> 15:01.233
You're very welcome.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.819
Yeah. Well,
that's nice to know.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.365
Do you have a towel?

15:08.449 --> 15:11.743
Have you got a towel?

15:11.828 --> 15:12.911
Kirsty.

15:12.996 --> 15:16.665
There's one in the bathroom.

15:18.001 --> 15:20.502
Oh, by the way,
did Daddy tell you I got a room?

15:20.587 --> 15:23.171
It's not that big,
but it's okay.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.423
Julia?

15:27.927 --> 15:31.096
Julia?

16:18.186 --> 16:19.978
What shall we drink to?

16:23.608 --> 16:24.900
Wedded bliss?

16:25.943 --> 16:27.694
I'm very happy.

16:27.779 --> 16:30.030
I'm sure you are.

16:31.908 --> 16:34.326
You're gonna let me
kiss the bride?

16:49.300 --> 16:50.967
What about Larry?

16:58.309 --> 17:00.894
Forget him.

17:42.270 --> 17:45.105
Julia Julia Julia...

18:02.331 --> 18:04.916
I need to... take the weight away
from me, my foot's caught.

18:05.001 --> 18:06.752
- You got it?
- I got it.

18:06.836 --> 18:09.337
Now just push it
to me as I pull.

18:35.865 --> 18:37.991
It's never enough.

18:40.828 --> 18:44.539
Julia. Jul...

18:49.128 --> 18:51.046
Please.

18:55.092 --> 18:58.053
I'll do anything you want.

19:00.723 --> 19:02.599
Anything.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.611
Here.

19:15.905 --> 19:18.114
Oh, is it deep?

19:18.199 --> 19:20.033
I don't know. I haven't looked.

19:20.117 --> 19:21.827
You know me and blood.

19:21.911 --> 19:24.287
- I'm gonna faint.
- You're not going to faint.

19:24.372 --> 19:26.289
Oh, shit!

19:26.374 --> 19:29.835
- L... le... let me see.
- Shit!

19:29.919 --> 19:33.088
Oh, it's going
to need stitches.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.466
- I'm gonna throw up.
- You're not going to throw up.

19:36.551 --> 19:38.885
- Just take it easy, just take it easy.
- I'm gonna throw up.

19:38.970 --> 19:41.054
It's going to be all right.

19:41.138 --> 19:43.849
Let's get you to the hospital.

19:43.933 --> 19:46.560
So stupid.

20:05.121 --> 20:06.872
What happened?

20:06.956 --> 20:08.874
It was just an accident.
He's all right.

20:08.958 --> 20:11.042
Look, will you drive?
He needs stitches.

20:11.127 --> 20:13.503
- Yeah, sure.
- The keys are in the kitchen.

20:13.588 --> 20:17.299
- So stupid.
- It's all right.

20:18.843 --> 20:20.844
So stupid.

22:44.655 --> 22:48.199
No no, I am not kidding.

22:48.284 --> 22:49.826
This doctor is poking around

22:49.910 --> 22:52.704
with all the delicacy
and compassion of Josef Mengele,

22:52.788 --> 22:54.581
and I'm warning him,
"Listen, I'm gonna pass out."

22:54.665 --> 22:56.666
He says, "Oh no, of course you're not,
old boy . Of course you're not."

22:56.751 --> 22:59.377
The next thing you know,
I'm on the floor

22:59.462 --> 23:01.796
and he's standing there
like he's the one who needs help.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.173
He probably is afraid
you're gonna sue him.

23:03.257 --> 23:05.008
I should do it!

23:05.092 --> 23:06.634
Bill, I should do it.
You know all about that stuff.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.428
I'll call you tomorrow.
We'll sue his ass.

23:15.394 --> 23:18.229
- Doctors.
- That's right, honey.

23:18.314 --> 23:20.398
And what's my
darling daughter drinking?

23:20.483 --> 23:22.067
I don't remember.

23:22.151 --> 23:23.568
Listen, Julia,
you want some more bubbly?

23:23.652 --> 23:26.488
No. No more for me, thanks.

23:26.572 --> 23:29.032
Okay. Okay, stop.

23:29.116 --> 23:31.618
- I'm not gonna be able to stand up.
- So lie down.

23:38.751 --> 23:41.086
Would you all excuse me?

23:41.170 --> 23:42.754
I think I'm going to go to bed.

23:42.838 --> 23:46.299
Are you all right, darling?

23:46.383 --> 23:48.301
I think we ought
to be making a move, too.

23:48.385 --> 23:50.136
No... Bill!

23:50.221 --> 23:51.679
Absolutely not!

23:51.764 --> 23:53.264
This is the night
of the paper hats here.

23:53.349 --> 23:56.559
We're celebrating something,
so sit down.

23:56.644 --> 23:59.187
Good night.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.022
You'll have to come to us next.

24:01.107 --> 24:03.316
Yeah, real soon. I'm glad you're back.

24:03.400 --> 24:04.734
Thank you.

24:04.819 --> 24:06.528
- Good night.
- Good night.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.797
- Does it still hurt?
- What?

24:27.842 --> 24:29.968
No, only when I drink.

25:44.960 --> 25:47.045
Oh, God.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.966
Oh! Christ!

26:00.768 --> 26:01.935
Julia.

26:06.357 --> 26:08.691
Oh my God.

26:08.776 --> 26:10.360
Don't look at me.

26:14.156 --> 26:16.574
Who...

26:16.659 --> 26:18.493
who are you?

26:18.577 --> 26:21.871
I said don't look.

26:23.791 --> 26:25.625
Help me!

26:30.714 --> 26:33.549
Tell me who you are.

26:35.177 --> 26:36.678
Frank.

26:41.517 --> 26:43.393
No.

26:43.477 --> 26:44.894
No!

26:44.979 --> 26:47.272
Believe me, it's me.

26:47.356 --> 26:50.149
It's really me.

26:50.234 --> 26:53.278
His blood on the floor,

26:53.362 --> 26:54.779
it brought me back.

26:57.032 --> 26:58.783
Back?

27:00.577 --> 27:02.745
From where?

27:03.914 --> 27:06.249
Just help me, will you?

27:07.459 --> 27:09.294
Please, God, help me!

27:35.154 --> 27:37.864
- Somebody...
- Wait.

27:53.339 --> 27:56.215
You can't leave me like this.
You can't.

27:58.719 --> 28:00.928
What do you want me to do?

28:01.013 --> 28:03.681
The blood brought me this far.

28:03.766 --> 28:05.683
I need more.

28:08.771 --> 28:11.064
You have to heal me.

28:23.911 --> 28:25.286
Hi.

28:25.371 --> 28:27.205
Are you all right?

28:31.794 --> 28:33.961
Kirsty? I thought I'd lost you.

28:34.046 --> 28:36.756
No, I'm here.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.092
Good night.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.198
So why didn't you stay
at Larry's house?

29:02.282 --> 29:03.408
There's plenty of room.

29:03.492 --> 29:06.077
Oh, yeah, there's room,
and there's Julia.

29:06.161 --> 29:08.162
I see.

29:19.174 --> 29:21.467
She's like you.
She's so damn polite.

29:21.552 --> 29:22.802
Oh, yeah? Meaning what?

29:22.886 --> 29:26.139
Oh, I don't know.
She's uptight and frigid.

29:26.223 --> 29:27.306
I beg your pardon.

29:27.391 --> 29:29.892
See, there you go.
"I beg your pardon."

29:29.977 --> 29:32.270
Hey, we're not all frigid.

29:32.354 --> 29:33.813
- Oh, no?
- Oh, no.

29:33.897 --> 29:35.314
Oh, no?

29:35.399 --> 29:37.108
Oh, no.

29:37.192 --> 29:38.609
That's not what I heard.

29:38.694 --> 29:41.487
Well, you must have been speaking
to all the wrong people.

30:21.737 --> 30:23.696
Anything?

30:24.698 --> 30:26.741
Anything.

30:50.390 --> 30:51.807
You'll do it?

30:51.892 --> 30:54.268
Yes...

30:56.230 --> 30:58.147
I will.

32:09.177 --> 32:10.886
Kirsty? Kirsty?

32:10.971 --> 32:12.930
Kirsty!

32:14.975 --> 32:17.101
- You all right?
- Yeah.

32:17.185 --> 32:19.020
I don't know.

32:20.022 --> 32:22.148
I was dreaming.

32:24.901 --> 32:27.278
Daddy!

32:38.957 --> 32:40.291
Hello.

32:50.719 --> 32:52.386
I'm all right, honey.

32:52.471 --> 32:54.680
I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

32:54.765 --> 32:57.141
Never better.

32:57.225 --> 32:59.810
- Now you sleep well, okay?
- Yeah.

32:59.895 --> 33:01.812
I love you, sweetie.

33:01.897 --> 33:03.898
I love you too, Daddy.

33:03.982 --> 33:06.150
Bye.

33:11.156 --> 33:13.949
- Who was it?
- She had a bad dream.

33:14.034 --> 33:16.577
- Who?
- Kirsty.

33:24.336 --> 33:26.587
Kirsty.

33:53.281 --> 33:56.617
- Not much fun, is it?
- What?

33:56.702 --> 33:58.744
Drinking alone.

34:01.665 --> 34:03.624
Not much.

34:05.836 --> 34:08.545
I thought maybe...

34:08.630 --> 34:11.465
well...

34:11.550 --> 34:14.342
if we're both on our own,
maybe we could have a drink together.

34:21.393 --> 34:22.893
Why not?

34:28.984 --> 34:31.318
You know, it's not
often that I...

34:31.402 --> 34:33.654
you know.

34:33.739 --> 34:36.614
There's a first time
for everything.

34:36.699 --> 34:38.492
That's right, yeah.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.786
I suppose that's right.

34:44.833 --> 34:47.168
Would you... like a drink?

34:47.252 --> 34:48.878
Oh, no no no.

34:48.962 --> 34:52.089
I'm well over my limit.

34:52.174 --> 34:55.259
You know, it's funny,

34:55.342 --> 34:58.137
but I...

34:59.973 --> 35:03.058
I feel like I've known you
for years, you know?

35:08.690 --> 35:10.566
What's the matter?

35:15.322 --> 35:18.783
It's what you
brought me here for, isn't it?

35:18.867 --> 35:21.452
Well, isn't it?

35:21.536 --> 35:23.913
I suppose so, yes.

35:23.997 --> 35:25.831
So what's your problem?

35:25.916 --> 35:28.000
Let's get on with it.

35:31.254 --> 35:33.756
You're not gonna change
your fucking mind, are you?

35:36.009 --> 35:37.927
I'm sorry.

35:38.011 --> 35:39.345
Let's go upstairs.

35:39.429 --> 35:43.224
Okay okay. Sorry, okay? Okay.

35:49.856 --> 35:51.690
Right.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.955
This isn't the bedroom.

36:06.039 --> 36:08.999
No.

36:11.878 --> 36:13.671
So what's going on?

36:16.424 --> 36:18.217
We don't need a bed, do we?

36:20.220 --> 36:22.930
Well, no, I suppose not.

36:25.851 --> 36:28.686
I've always preferred the floor.

36:28.770 --> 36:32.314
Oh. First time
for everything, eh?

36:33.984 --> 36:35.901
Why don't you...

36:35.986 --> 36:37.987
take your jacket off?

36:38.071 --> 36:41.448
Yeah, why don't I?

37:02.304 --> 37:04.805
Why don't you do
the same thing?

37:04.890 --> 37:08.392
Maybe I will.

37:20.113 --> 37:22.364
You're very beautiful.

37:22.449 --> 37:24.783
Am I?

37:24.868 --> 37:27.828
Oh, you know you are.

37:27.913 --> 37:31.790
Loveliest woman...
I've ever seen.

37:31.875 --> 37:35.210
Oh, Christ.

37:35.295 --> 37:36.921
What's wrong?

37:38.840 --> 37:41.467
Just one minute.

37:41.551 --> 37:43.052
Too much drink.

37:43.136 --> 37:45.220
Empty the old bladder.

37:50.477 --> 37:52.186
Did you lock this?

37:56.441 --> 37:58.692
Please! Please!

38:22.092 --> 38:24.218
Don't look at me.

39:29.993 --> 39:32.327
Jesus Christ.

39:54.851 --> 39:56.643
See?

39:56.728 --> 39:59.646
It's making me whole again.

40:01.816 --> 40:03.734
Every drop of blood you spill

40:03.818 --> 40:05.569
puts more flesh on my bones.

40:05.653 --> 40:08.238
And we both
want that, don't we?

40:11.493 --> 40:14.369
Good.

40:14.454 --> 40:17.414
Come here.

40:17.499 --> 40:19.124
Come here, damn you,
I wanna touch you.

40:21.336 --> 40:24.171
Come to Daddy.

40:37.852 --> 40:39.895
Julia!

41:02.335 --> 41:04.294
Julia.

41:08.258 --> 41:11.093
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

41:30.155 --> 41:32.239
Julia,

41:32.323 --> 41:35.784
I was calling for you.
Didn't you hear?

41:35.869 --> 41:37.786
Are you in there?

41:37.871 --> 41:40.164
You want a cookie, little girl?

41:41.833 --> 41:43.959
I'm feeling sick.

41:44.043 --> 41:46.920
Oh, babe. Is there anything
I can get you?

41:47.005 --> 41:50.257
Maybe a... a brandy.

41:50.341 --> 41:52.176
It's coming right up.

41:52.260 --> 41:55.220
I'll be down... in a minute.

41:56.681 --> 41:58.182
Okay.

41:58.266 --> 42:00.475
There's no hurry.

42:23.291 --> 42:25.709
Frank?

42:31.174 --> 42:33.967
I'm hurting.

42:34.052 --> 42:35.636
Hurting?

42:35.720 --> 42:37.554
My nerves are
beginning to work again.

42:37.639 --> 42:39.556
Good.

42:39.641 --> 42:41.642
One more, maybe two...

42:41.726 --> 42:44.019
- Not again.
- ...to heal me completely.

42:44.103 --> 42:47.272
Then we can be away
from here before they start to follow.

42:48.858 --> 42:50.984
- Who?
- The Cenobites.

42:51.069 --> 42:54.238
It's only a matter of time before
they find I've slipped them.

42:54.322 --> 42:56.406
I must get away from here.

42:56.491 --> 42:58.242
Julia?

42:58.326 --> 43:00.452
Are you all right?

43:03.414 --> 43:06.208
Just a moment.

43:09.087 --> 43:11.713
Put on some music.
Will you, babe?

43:11.798 --> 43:14.299
Yeah, sure.

43:14.384 --> 43:17.261
Poor Larry, obedient as ever.

43:17.345 --> 43:20.180
Keep your voice down.

43:20.265 --> 43:23.016
Don't want "babe" to hear.

43:23.101 --> 43:26.603
You're hurting.

43:26.688 --> 43:28.605
You won't cheat me, will you?

43:28.690 --> 43:31.275
You'll stay with me, help me.

43:31.359 --> 43:34.278
Then we can be together
the way we were before.

43:34.362 --> 43:36.530
We belong to each other now.

43:36.614 --> 43:38.782
For better,

43:38.866 --> 43:40.951
for worse.

43:41.035 --> 43:43.453
Like love...

43:43.538 --> 43:46.957
only real.

44:00.138 --> 44:03.098
I'm sorry... I'm new here.
You're gonna have to wait.

44:05.268 --> 44:06.935
Could you not do that, please?

44:07.020 --> 44:08.812
Where's the manager?

44:08.896 --> 44:11.064
That's a problem too,
because he's out to lunch right now.

44:11.149 --> 44:13.150
I want to see
somebody in charge.

44:15.153 --> 44:16.445
Then you're gonna have to wait.

44:17.655 --> 44:20.907
- Excuse me.
- Well, excuse me!

44:23.703 --> 44:25.495
What are you doing?

44:35.465 --> 44:37.341
Give those back.

44:41.012 --> 44:43.805
Oh my God.

44:46.225 --> 44:47.851
Get out.

44:47.935 --> 44:49.770
You get out of here.

45:09.332 --> 45:11.083
Hi.

45:11.167 --> 45:12.501
Hi.

45:12.585 --> 45:14.503
Just came by to see what
you're doing after work.

45:15.588 --> 45:17.798
What's wrong?

45:17.882 --> 45:19.841
- Something weird.
- What?

45:26.140 --> 45:28.475
Nothing.

45:38.236 --> 45:40.237
You're sure we're not
gonna be interrupted?

45:42.490 --> 45:44.408
Quite sure.

45:45.410 --> 45:47.077
Only I...

45:47.161 --> 45:48.328
I like to be careful.

46:51.142 --> 46:53.059
I can taste that.

46:53.144 --> 46:56.563
It's a long time
since I tasted anything.

46:59.025 --> 47:02.569
You promised me an explanation.

47:04.280 --> 47:06.907
This is it.

47:06.991 --> 47:08.825
- Let me see.
- No, don't touch it!

47:08.910 --> 47:12.204
It's dangerous. It opens doors.

47:12.288 --> 47:15.081
What kind of doors?

47:15.166 --> 47:17.459
Doors to the pleasures
of heaven or hell.

47:17.543 --> 47:20.545
I didn't care which.

47:20.630 --> 47:22.506
I thought I'd gone
to the limits.

47:22.590 --> 47:25.383
I hadn't. The Cenobites gave me

47:25.468 --> 47:28.512
an experience beyond limits.

47:28.596 --> 47:30.347
Pain and pleasure...

47:30.431 --> 47:32.349
indivisible.

48:08.010 --> 48:10.887
They won't get me back.

48:13.766 --> 48:16.393
I'm going to live and you're going
to help me, yes?

48:16.477 --> 48:18.436
Yes.

48:18.521 --> 48:21.273
They'll never find us,

48:21.357 --> 48:24.693
not in the whole wide world.

48:26.946 --> 48:30.240
Boom Boom has got him now!

48:30.324 --> 48:32.200
Boom Boom has got him.

48:32.285 --> 48:33.827
He's knocked down again.

48:35.496 --> 48:38.665
I thought this kind
of stuff made you sick.

48:38.749 --> 48:41.876
- Moran's getting back up.
- I've seen worse.

48:45.047 --> 48:46.423
Are you all right?

48:46.507 --> 48:48.925
Fine.

48:49.010 --> 48:50.677
- No. No...
- 'Cause we can watch something else

48:50.761 --> 48:53.763
if you'd like.
Come on! Get him!

49:04.942 --> 49:07.110
No! No!

49:07.194 --> 49:09.362
What was that?

49:10.531 --> 49:13.033
I think I left
a window open upstairs.

49:13.117 --> 49:15.577
- I'll go see.
- No.

49:16.912 --> 49:19.414
It was nothing.

49:19.498 --> 49:21.207
Larry!

49:21.292 --> 49:24.502
What's the matter
with you anyway?

49:27.548 --> 49:30.884
It's just that
I hate the thunder.

49:30.968 --> 49:32.886
I'm here.

49:32.970 --> 49:34.679
You're safe.

49:36.182 --> 49:38.391
You're trembling.

49:40.519 --> 49:43.396
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

49:56.410 --> 49:58.328
Look.

49:58.412 --> 50:01.706
I really should check it out.

50:01.791 --> 50:03.917
Don't go up there, please.

50:05.294 --> 50:08.588
We'll both go up. Come on.

50:08.673 --> 50:12.092
- Larry, please!
- Don't worry about it. Come on.

50:29.360 --> 50:32.612
- Don't.
- It's okay . It's okay.

50:44.625 --> 50:47.627
It's probably a rat.

50:47.712 --> 50:49.337
I told you.

50:49.422 --> 50:52.132
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

50:54.510 --> 50:57.137
Let's go downstairs.
I'll make it better.

51:11.861 --> 51:14.279
No, this is enough light.

51:16.157 --> 51:18.616
Let's go, come on.

51:18.701 --> 51:21.453
Let's go inside.

51:27.460 --> 51:29.836
Oh, yes.

51:38.471 --> 51:40.889
Yes. Yes.

52:03.662 --> 52:04.871
No.

52:07.208 --> 52:09.209
No!

52:10.795 --> 52:13.254
No, please don't. No, please!

52:13.339 --> 52:14.881
I can't bear it, please!

52:14.965 --> 52:17.592
Please, no!

52:19.887 --> 52:21.429
Please!

52:22.515 --> 52:24.057
Please stop!

52:34.860 --> 52:38.404
I can't bear it! Please, no!

52:50.876 --> 52:53.127
I don't understand you.

52:53.212 --> 52:55.672
I mean, one minute...

52:57.049 --> 52:59.259
you're all over me,
and the next...

53:01.220 --> 53:04.389
I just don't understand you.

53:15.693 --> 53:17.485
I don't know.

53:17.570 --> 53:20.446
Maybe we shouldn't
have come back.

53:20.531 --> 53:22.824
Brooklyn certainly wasn't
any worse than this.

53:23.826 --> 53:25.785
Look.

53:25.870 --> 53:28.454
You love her, so there must be
something worth loving.

53:28.539 --> 53:31.499
I wish it were that simple.

53:31.584 --> 53:34.961
I've got a real problem
here, kiddo.

53:35.045 --> 53:36.963
She doesn't even want
to leave the house.

53:37.047 --> 53:38.923
Really?

53:39.967 --> 53:41.843
It's like she's...

53:41.927 --> 53:44.971
- waiting for something.
- What?

53:45.055 --> 53:47.055
I don't know.

53:52.563 --> 53:54.564
It's way beyond me.

53:58.068 --> 54:00.403
Look.

54:00.487 --> 54:02.906
Could you... would you...

54:04.992 --> 54:07.577
stop by sometime?

54:07.661 --> 54:09.037
Try to make friends?

54:10.456 --> 54:11.664
Sure.

54:11.749 --> 54:14.250
Who knows, maybe all she needs

54:14.335 --> 54:16.377
is somebody to talk to.

54:16.462 --> 54:20.131
- You can't love him.
- You know I don't.

54:28.015 --> 54:31.309
- So where's the harm?
- I said no.

54:31.393 --> 54:34.437
Then find me somebody else,
before they come looking.

54:34.521 --> 54:36.981
Now!

55:11.725 --> 55:14.018
I...

55:14.103 --> 55:16.312
I get lonely sometimes.

55:19.149 --> 55:20.775
Everybody does.

55:36.250 --> 55:38.960
Come in.

55:42.464 --> 55:43.506
What is this,

55:43.590 --> 55:46.634
a game?

55:46.719 --> 55:49.971
Jesus Christ!

56:01.191 --> 56:04.610
Oh, Christ! Help me!

56:07.114 --> 56:09.282
Don't!

56:14.329 --> 56:17.707
- Get out of here!
- Please.

56:17.791 --> 56:21.544
Don't let him kill me.

57:50.300 --> 57:53.344
Help me.

58:08.569 --> 58:10.153
No.

58:10.237 --> 58:13.739
- Kirsty, it's Frank. It's Uncle Frank.
- No!

58:13.824 --> 58:15.575
- You remember.
- No!

58:15.659 --> 58:19.287
- Come to Daddy.
- Get the fuck off of me!

58:21.623 --> 58:24.625
You've grown. You're beautiful.

58:24.710 --> 58:26.961
Don't...

58:27.045 --> 58:28.963
don't touch me!

58:29.047 --> 58:31.841
Don't touch me
or so help me I... l...

58:31.925 --> 58:33.634
What will you do?

58:33.719 --> 58:36.971
What can you do?

58:37.055 --> 58:40.391
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

58:40.475 --> 58:43.728
I bet you make
your daddy so proud.

58:43.812 --> 58:45.354
Don't you, beautiful?

58:45.439 --> 58:47.815
- This isn't happening.
- I used to tell myself that.

58:47.900 --> 58:50.234
Used to try and pretend
I was dreaming all the pain.

58:50.319 --> 58:52.111
But don't you kid yourself.

58:52.196 --> 58:54.655
Some things have to be endured,

58:54.740 --> 58:57.742
and that's what makes
the pleasures so sweet.

59:02.664 --> 59:04.264
No!

59:12.633 --> 59:13.716
Give me that!

59:17.304 --> 59:18.930
- No.
- Give it to me!

59:19.014 --> 59:21.307
You want it?

59:21.391 --> 59:24.227
One last time:

59:24.311 --> 59:25.811
Give me that box.

59:25.896 --> 59:28.022
- You want it?
- Give me the box!

59:28.106 --> 59:30.483
You want it? Fucking have it!

59:32.736 --> 59:35.571
No!

59:46.333 --> 59:49.877
Kirsty.

59:49.962 --> 59:52.838
Come to Daddy.

01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:11.816
It's Frank. You remember.

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:14.110
It's Uncle Frank.

01:00:34.089 --> 01:00:37.967
Are you all right?

01:01:05.704 --> 01:01:08.247
You're awake.

01:01:10.751 --> 01:01:12.460
- Good girl.
- What happened?

01:01:12.544 --> 01:01:15.338
- I'll get the doctor.
- Wait a minute. How did I get here?

01:01:15.422 --> 01:01:18.299
I won't be a moment.

01:01:25.265 --> 01:01:27.850
Please, get back into bed.

01:01:27.934 --> 01:01:29.435
I have to call my father.

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:32.855
That's easily arranged,
but first, back into bed.

01:01:32.939 --> 01:01:34.523
It's important. It really is...

01:01:34.608 --> 01:01:36.233
First things first.

01:01:36.318 --> 01:01:40.279
We'll get you a telephone
after we've talked.

01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:43.949
What about this?
Ring any bells?

01:01:44.034 --> 01:01:45.951
You were hanging onto it
like grim death.

01:01:47.871 --> 01:01:49.246
I don't remember.

01:01:49.331 --> 01:01:52.041
Well, the police
will want to speak to you.

01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:55.795
- You know that.
- Oh, Christ.

01:01:55.879 --> 01:01:59.757
In the meantime,
maybe this will jog your memory.

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:15.940
Shit.

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:41.645
Open!

01:06:13.553 --> 01:06:15.471
Oh, come on!

01:06:54.052 --> 01:06:57.012
The box. You opened it,

01:06:57.097 --> 01:06:58.347
we came.

01:06:58.431 --> 01:07:00.849
It's just a puzzle box!

01:07:00.934 --> 01:07:02.351
Oh, no.

01:07:02.435 --> 01:07:04.311
It is a means to summon us.

01:07:04.396 --> 01:07:06.146
Who are you?

01:07:06.231 --> 01:07:10.025
Explorers in the further
regions of experience:

01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:13.946
Demons to some,
angels to others.

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:16.532
It was a mistake!

01:07:16.616 --> 01:07:19.243
I didn't... I didn't
mean to open it!

01:07:19.327 --> 01:07:21.537
It was a mistake!

01:07:22.539 --> 01:07:24.415
You can all...

01:07:24.499 --> 01:07:26.500
go to hell!

01:07:26.584 --> 01:07:30.879
- We can't. Not alone.
- You solved the box,

01:07:30.964 --> 01:07:34.341
we came.
Now you must come with us.

01:07:34.426 --> 01:07:37.010
Taste our pleasures.

01:07:37.095 --> 01:07:39.638
Please, go away
and leave me alone!

01:07:39.723 --> 01:07:43.267
Oh, no tears, please.

01:07:43.351 --> 01:07:45.602
It's a waste of good suffering.

01:07:47.021 --> 01:07:50.107
Wait! Wait! Wait! Please, wait!

01:07:50.191 --> 01:07:51.942
No time for argument.

01:07:52.026 --> 01:07:54.987
You've done this before, right?

01:07:55.071 --> 01:07:57.698
Many many times.

01:07:59.159 --> 01:08:01.201
To a man called Frank Cotton?

01:08:01.286 --> 01:08:02.911
Oh, yes.

01:08:02.996 --> 01:08:05.080
He escaped you.

01:08:05.165 --> 01:08:07.291
Nobody escapes us.

01:08:07.375 --> 01:08:09.960
He did. I've seen him.
I've seen him.

01:08:10.044 --> 01:08:12.963
- Impossible.
- He's alive!

01:08:13.047 --> 01:08:15.424
Supposing he had escaped us.

01:08:15.508 --> 01:08:17.259
What has that to do with you?

01:08:17.343 --> 01:08:20.929
I... I can...
I can lead you to him,

01:08:21.014 --> 01:08:24.600
and you can take him back
instead of me.

01:08:24.684 --> 01:08:26.852
Perhaps we'd prefer you.

01:08:26.935 --> 01:08:29.520
I want to hear him
confess himself,

01:08:29.606 --> 01:08:32.024
then maybe...

01:08:32.108 --> 01:08:34.026
maybe.

01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:37.029
But if you cheat us...

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:40.616
We'll tear your soul apart.

01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:49.917
She'll tell them everything.

01:08:50.001 --> 01:08:53.377
I don't think so.
She'll want to warn Larry first.

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:55.380
That's probably her now...

01:08:55.465 --> 01:08:58.466
- or the police.
- It doesn't make any difference.

01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:01.386
Don't you care?

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:03.680
What I care about
is a new skin.

01:09:03.765 --> 01:09:05.974
Maybe we should just leave.

01:09:06.059 --> 01:09:08.185
Like this? Look at me.

01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:10.562
We can't just stay here.

01:09:12.941 --> 01:09:14.983
My brother will be home soon.

01:09:30.792 --> 01:09:32.417
What is it?

01:09:34.379 --> 01:09:35.837
I don't know where to begin.

01:09:35.921 --> 01:09:38.756
What are you talking about?

01:09:40.593 --> 01:09:42.761
It's best you see for yourself.

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:45.973
I left her here safe and sound.

01:09:46.057 --> 01:09:47.224
I even locked the door.

01:09:47.308 --> 01:09:48.934
Well, she's not here now.

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:51.353
I'll start looking for her.

01:09:51.437 --> 01:09:53.689
Maybe she's gone back to...

01:09:53.773 --> 01:09:56.191
to her father's house.

01:10:42.614 --> 01:10:44.239
Daddy?

01:10:44.324 --> 01:10:47.618
Daddy, it's me, it's Kirsty!
Let me in!

01:10:47.702 --> 01:10:50.829
Daddy, let me in!

01:11:00.048 --> 01:11:04.343
- Kirsty? It's very late.
- Where is my dad?

01:11:04.427 --> 01:11:08.221
- What's the matter?
- I want to see my father!

01:11:08.306 --> 01:11:10.849
Of course.

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.821
Where is he?

01:11:24.906 --> 01:11:26.531
Where is he?

01:11:26.616 --> 01:11:27.783
Daddy?

01:11:27.867 --> 01:11:29.785
Daddy?

01:11:29.869 --> 01:11:33.038
- Daddy, you're okay . You're all right.
- Sure I am. I am.

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:36.792
- You're okay!
- It's okay.

01:11:36.876 --> 01:11:40.212
I was so afraid that
something happened to you.

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:42.381
I know, I know.

01:11:44.592 --> 01:11:46.760
I need to talk to you.

01:11:46.844 --> 01:11:47.886
Yeah. Of course.

01:11:47.971 --> 01:11:51.264
It's okay, baby,
Julia told me everything.

01:11:51.349 --> 01:11:53.725
Oh, no, see...

01:11:55.395 --> 01:11:58.063
your brother Frank is upstairs.

01:11:58.147 --> 01:12:00.983
He's upstairs
and he's trying to kill you.

01:12:01.067 --> 01:12:03.443
- He's gonna kill you!
- No, wait wait wait.

01:12:03.528 --> 01:12:06.029
Whatever Frank did
was unspeakable.

01:12:07.865 --> 01:12:09.908
Unspeakable.

01:12:11.786 --> 01:12:13.495
But believe me,

01:12:13.579 --> 01:12:16.790
it's finished with now.

01:12:16.874 --> 01:12:18.917
Why is it finished?

01:12:19.002 --> 01:12:21.336
He's gone.

01:12:21.421 --> 01:12:25.090
What does "gone" mean?

01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:27.259
He's dead, Kirsty.

01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:29.511
He was insane, baby.

01:12:29.595 --> 01:12:32.681
A mad dog.
I had to put him out of his misery.

01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:35.726
Jesus, what a scene.

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:41.314
And when I'm feeling better,

01:12:41.399 --> 01:12:44.609
I'll go to the police and try to make
them understand.

01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:46.695
God knows...

01:12:46.779 --> 01:12:49.698
I don't really
understand myself.

01:12:52.118 --> 01:12:54.828
Did he hurt you, baby?

01:12:56.414 --> 01:12:58.498
No, I'm okay.

01:12:58.583 --> 01:13:01.626
He's better off dead.

01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:03.670
Poor Frank.

01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:06.965
I don't believe this.

01:13:07.050 --> 01:13:09.468
- I don't believe this.
- Believe it.

01:13:13.973 --> 01:13:15.849
I need to see him.

01:13:15.933 --> 01:13:18.226
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

01:13:19.479 --> 01:13:20.854
Yes.

01:13:23.608 --> 01:13:25.150
Show her.

01:14:26.712 --> 01:14:29.381
We want the man

01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:32.175
who did this.

01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:34.511
No.

01:14:34.595 --> 01:14:36.221
No, that wasn't the deal.

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:38.431
He's my father
and you can't have him.

01:14:38.516 --> 01:14:40.100
No!

01:14:43.062 --> 01:14:46.022
Move.

01:14:46.107 --> 01:14:47.816
Kirsty...

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:49.568
Move!

01:15:01.372 --> 01:15:02.747
What's the matter?

01:15:02.832 --> 01:15:04.249
There's no time.

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:07.627
Wait, no wait. I told you
all that's over with now.

01:15:07.712 --> 01:15:10.505
No, it's not!
We've got to get out of here!

01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:12.465
No, stay with us.

01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:16.261
We can all be happy here.

01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:19.306
No.

01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:22.893
Come to Daddy.

01:15:25.354 --> 01:15:28.607
Oh my God!

01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:30.442
Come...

01:15:30.526 --> 01:15:32.527
to Daddy.

01:15:43.289 --> 01:15:45.415
Frank!

01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:55.800
Well...

01:15:58.471 --> 01:16:02.015
so much for the cat-
and-mouse shit!

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:15.862
No!

01:16:15.947 --> 01:16:17.530
Not me!

01:16:29.877 --> 01:16:32.712
It's nothing personal, baby.

01:16:52.024 --> 01:16:54.109
Where are you, beautiful?

01:16:59.407 --> 01:17:02.284
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

01:19:48.868 --> 01:19:51.786
Oh no.

01:20:01.338 --> 01:20:03.506
Oh my God.

01:20:03.591 --> 01:20:07.802
Daddy.

01:20:07.887 --> 01:20:10.138
No, don't mourn him.

01:20:10.222 --> 01:20:13.349
He was dead long before
we ever touched him.

01:20:13.434 --> 01:20:16.311
- Bastard!
- Now, hush now.

01:20:16.395 --> 01:20:20.231
Everything's all right.

01:20:20.316 --> 01:20:22.192
- Frank's here.
- Bastard!

01:20:22.276 --> 01:20:25.236
Your dear old Uncle Frank.

01:20:31.869 --> 01:20:33.453
What the hell is that?

01:21:24.964 --> 01:21:27.131
Frank.

01:21:27.216 --> 01:21:30.343
No!

01:21:30.427 --> 01:21:32.595
We had to hear it
from your own lips.

01:21:33.681 --> 01:21:36.266
This isn't for your eyes.

01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:38.893
You set me up,

01:21:38.978 --> 01:21:40.562
bitch!

01:22:46.045 --> 01:22:49.881
"Jesus wept."

01:23:12.196 --> 01:23:14.447
Not leaving us so soon,
are you?

01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:58.366
We have such sights
to show you.

01:24:03.330 --> 01:24:05.790
Oh, shit.

01:24:10.337 --> 01:24:13.381
- No! Don't do that!
- Go to hell!

01:24:43.036 --> 01:24:44.636
Kirsty!

01:25:13.150 --> 01:25:14.942
No.

01:25:34.129 --> 01:25:36.255
Steve.
