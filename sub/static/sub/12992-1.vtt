- I love this place.
- MAN: Yeah, me too.

00:52.485 --> 00:54.988
So strange though.
Why is it called a river?

00:54.989 --> 00:58.291
That's what it is.

00:58.292 --> 00:59.292
Thank you.

00:59.293 --> 01:02.696
It's dried up, you know. I actually used
to come here a lot when I was a kid.

01:02.697 --> 01:04.096
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:04.096 --> 01:07.132
- I used to ride my bike down there.
- It's our new spot.

01:07.133 --> 01:09.102
What, you gonna steal
my childhood memories?

01:09.103 --> 01:11.504
No. We'll just make new ones.

01:11.505 --> 01:14.273
- Promise?
- Promise.

01:31.424 --> 01:35.629
- Give me that thing.
- MAN: Uh-bup-bup... my camera, my show.

01:35.630 --> 01:38.431
Besides, you're prettier than I am.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.399
No fair.

01:43.537 --> 01:45.036
- Don't show my face.
- Shut up.

01:45.037 --> 01:46.237
Don't show my face.

01:46.238 --> 01:48.442
- All right, give me that.
- No.

01:48.443 --> 01:50.443
I am serious, little missy.

01:50.444 --> 01:53.512

- Don't cry.

- (LOUD SINGING)
- (GASPS) God!

02:07.461 --> 02:10.663
I love it when you record me.

02:10.663 --> 02:15.434
No, really, I do.
It means that you love me.

02:19.773 --> 02:22.775
What color nail polish is that?

02:22.776 --> 02:24.476
Since when do you care about...

02:24.477 --> 02:26.780
Goddamn it, Kev. You know
when to turn that thing off.

02:26.781 --> 02:28.781
- (BANGING ON DOOR)
- Shit.

02:28.782 --> 02:31.084
WOMAN: Get out here now.

02:31.085 --> 02:36.089
I told you not to leave your girlfriend's
damn bike in the damn driveway.

02:36.090 --> 02:37.790
Little slut.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.458
Slut?

02:45.232 --> 02:46.999
(INDISTINCT)

02:56.710 --> 03:01.981
Kevin, why are you so fascinated
with this thing, hmm?

03:06.720 --> 03:12.491
Don't keep me at arm's length, Kev.
I'm much more fun in the flesh.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.735
And that's all you get.

03:22.736 --> 03:25.905
(INDISTINCT ARGUING)

03:30.544 --> 03:32.812
- What the fuck?
- Oh, God!

MAN: (ON TV) 10:30 near downtown
Los Angeles a police pursuit.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.359
You see that van there
that is just passing...

03:46.360 --> 03:48.260
- KEV: Holy shit.
- Kev.

03:48.261 --> 03:49.963
- That's just down the block.
- Are you going to talk about it?

03:49.964 --> 03:55.267
Yes, let's talk about how awesome
this fucking chase is! Look at this.

03:55.768 --> 03:57.869
KEV: This is just down the street.

03:57.870 --> 04:00.173
Put that thing down and
face what's going on.

04:00.174 --> 04:04.777
What's going on? A crazy ass
chase headed right for us.

04:04.778 --> 04:09.782
What do you think is gonna happen?
You think that shit's gonna go viral?

04:09.783 --> 04:13.386
- You're gonna become famous?
- I got... I have to go shoot this.

04:13.387 --> 04:15.287
It's sick, Kev.

04:15.288 --> 04:19.190
- Put that thing down.
- Come on, baby, this is my chance.

04:19.791 --> 04:21.694
(SIRENS BLARING)

04:21.695 --> 04:25.464
Haven't you ever wanted to be a
part of something bigger than you?

04:31.304 --> 04:33.206
Oh, shit!

04:33.407 --> 04:37.241
It's here, it's here.
You made me miss it, fuck!

04:39.877 --> 04:44.415
- IRIS: Kev!
- Shit. Shit. Shit.

04:44.417 --> 04:46.719
Shit...

04:46.720 --> 04:49.821
- Jesus Christ, Grandma.
- You little pervert!

04:49.822 --> 04:52.457
Shit, you're gonna make me
fucking miss... Shit, shit.

04:55.392 --> 04:59.127
Fuck, fuck. I missed it.

(HORN HONKING)

05:07.941 --> 05:11.543
Get back inside! It's not safe
out here. Are you filming me?

05:11.744 --> 05:12.944
I'm on my property, man.

05:12.945 --> 05:15.714
- I'm on my own property right now.
- Seriously!

05:18.652 --> 05:21.488
We're able to see quite a few pedestrians
now gathering out on the streets...

this whole thing and get in on the action,

- get their special shots of the driver...
- (OPERA MUSIC PLAYING)

05:33.767 --> 05:37.269
The driver is driving
at such a high speed...

05:37.270 --> 05:39.571
You definitely don't want to be out
there and make yourself a target.

05:43.877 --> 05:46.843
Thank you, honey,
you made me miss it.

05:47.746 --> 05:50.883
Iris, what the hell. I'm sorry.

05:50.884 --> 05:55.587
Get back inside! I will tase your ass if you
don't get inside right now, God dammit.

05:55.588 --> 05:57.991
- Iris, get out of the street.
- I will get you off the street...

- (CROSS TALK)
- It's my girl...

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

06:19.312 --> 06:21.480
Please come in and have a seat.

06:25.518 --> 06:29.921
I'm detective Hughes. I'm gonna have
to record this conversation, okay?

06:29.922 --> 06:33.625
- Uh, tell me your full name?
- My name is Scarlett Kay.

06:33.626 --> 06:35.927
And what is your
occupation, Miss Kay?

06:35.928 --> 06:39.130
I'm a magician's assistant
for Dante the Great.

06:51.344 --> 06:55.448
HUGHES: The tape that you brought in
to us, where did you find that tape?

06:55.449 --> 07:01.119
KAY: In his dressing room, there is a
secret compartment behind the breaker box.

07:09.663 --> 07:14.633
Dante recorded everything.
He always needed an audience.

07:15.034 --> 07:16.969
(CHEERING)

07:16.970 --> 07:20.972
MAN: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so
much for coming out to the show tonight.

07:20.973 --> 07:25.043
WOMAN: (ON TV) The magician known
as Dante the Great was arrested today.

07:27.645 --> 07:31.984
So just 2 years ago, Dante
the Great was John McMullen.

07:31.985 --> 07:35.387
And he was living in a
trailer park in Atlanta

07:35.388 --> 07:37.622
barely making ends meet,
couldn't pay the rent.

07:37.623 --> 07:40.692
He would do tricks for all his
friends in the neighborhood.

07:40.693 --> 07:42.395
And he was real good at it.

07:42.396 --> 07:44.396
Cut the cards.

07:44.397 --> 07:45.897
- All right.
- All right.

07:45.898 --> 07:48.935
- Oh, yeah, that's the blue...
- Pretend like it isn't.

07:48.936 --> 07:50.502
Figured out the trick.

07:50.503 --> 07:53.606
Why don't you make some
beer appear? Be useful.

07:54.007 --> 07:58.111
You know, you guys are real funny for
a bunch of unemployed motherfuckers.

07:58.112 --> 08:01.914
Dante came in possession of a cloak.

08:01.915 --> 08:05.514
Nobody is really sure
where he got the cloak.

08:06.084 --> 08:11.724
MATTHEW: So the rumors are that Harry
Houdini himself once owned this cloak.

08:12.025 --> 08:16.495
And it frightened Houdini.
So he got rid of it.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.510
(LAUGHING)

08:50.463 --> 08:53.698
Woo! Woo!

08:53.699 --> 08:57.734
Well, there's no doubt that the
cloak changed Dante's life forever.

08:58.570 --> 09:00.771
(CHEERING AND WHISTLING)

09:05.341 --> 09:10.883
MATTHEW: His shows were completely
exclusive, passwords, knocking on doors.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.885
You got to know somebody
to even get a ticket.

09:16.587 --> 09:18.990
That was the most amazing
show I've ever seen.

09:18.991 --> 09:22.593
He picked my pocket.
From mid-balcony he picked my pocket,

09:22.594 --> 09:24.195
from the stage!
I don't know how he did it.

09:24.196 --> 09:27.098
We were in the show at
7 o'clock in New York.

09:27.099 --> 09:29.200
- We walk out of the doors...
- We're in LA.

09:29.201 --> 09:32.503
We're in LA. I... I...
I'm kind of fucking pissed,

09:32.504 --> 09:35.208
but I'm kind of like this is the
most amazing thing I've ever seen.

09:35.209 --> 09:39.944
His illusions were on a different
level than anyone else.

09:42.179 --> 09:44.516
Today's magic is dead.

09:44.517 --> 09:47.618
You want to... you want to learn
the trick, go Google, go find it.

09:47.619 --> 09:48.822
It's on Wikipedia.

09:48.823 --> 09:53.790
You will never discover how I do it.

09:55.092 --> 09:57.227
Hello, rabbit.

10:10.243 --> 10:14.545
WOMAN 1: (ON TV) Firefighters arrived on the
scene to see heavy flames on the east side.

10:14.546 --> 10:17.748
MAN: (ON TV) Not a lot of wind this afternoon,
so they're hoping to keep this contained...

10:17.749 --> 10:20.819
WOMAN 2: (ON TV) No word
of any injuries or anyone inside.

10:26.693 --> 10:31.728
We have an audience tonight,
so why aren't you working?

10:33.231 --> 10:36.233
- (INDISTINCT WHISPERING)
- What?

10:38.635 --> 10:40.770
What do you want from me?

10:43.276 --> 10:46.977
MATTHEW: The cloak's power
comes from what's inside it.

10:48.746 --> 10:53.184
But he had to feed it and it
was only hungry for one thing.

10:54.085 --> 10:59.858
Dante, oh, my God, turn it off.
It's not funny. Can you hand me a towel?

11:04.097 --> 11:05.464
Seriously?

(DANTE CHANTING)

11:13.755 --> 11:16.457
(GROANS)

11:19.712 --> 11:22.916
MATTHEW: There were some people that
went missing that were close to Dante.

11:22.917 --> 11:28.387
Some of his assistants,
no bodies, no evidence. Just gone.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.296

(WOMAN SCREAMING)

12:11.964 --> 12:14.733
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

12:21.274 --> 12:25.275
Tell me what was your first
impression of Dante when you met him.

12:25.276 --> 12:28.081
The first time I met him I was
auditioning for one of his shows

12:28.082 --> 12:32.284
and I was really nervous.
He was my idol.

12:32.285 --> 12:33.685
Oh, my God.

12:33.686 --> 12:36.688
Scarlet... she's different.

12:36.689 --> 12:41.293
I just know it was her and we
were meant to work together,

12:41.294 --> 12:44.896
meant to be great together.

12:44.897 --> 12:48.199
So you always wanted to
be a magician's assistant?

12:48.200 --> 12:50.801
No, I wanted to be a magician.
I wanted to work with him

12:50.802 --> 12:54.005
because I thought I would get to learn
how to do the tricks and the illusions,

12:54.006 --> 12:57.308
but no one on the crew
knew how he did anything.

12:57.309 --> 12:59.712
That was frustrating
to say the least.

12:59.713 --> 13:02.147
Take five, guys.

13:02.148 --> 13:05.116
I know that this can all be
very confusing to begin with.

13:05.117 --> 13:08.621
It can take a lifetime of practice.
And you're... you're brand new.

13:08.622 --> 13:13.125
Let's say, you and I just
put all this work aside

13:13.126 --> 13:18.430
and tonight you have dinner with me.
What do you say? Hmm?

13:18.431 --> 13:22.533
- No, I have... I have a thing.
- Cancel it.

13:22.534 --> 13:25.168
He is picking me up in an hour.

13:26.003 --> 13:27.137
Oh.

13:27.740 --> 13:29.441
Clay is my ex-boyfriend.

13:29.442 --> 13:32.842
When's the last time you
heard from Clay, Miss Kay?

13:33.912 --> 13:35.045
A month.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.749
How was your relationship with Clay?

13:37.750 --> 13:43.121
Clay had a temper, but it
was okay. We were okay.

13:50.463 --> 13:53.066
You weren't just an
employee of Dante, right?

13:53.067 --> 13:57.465
I mean, you guys had some
kind of a relationship?

13:57.470 --> 14:01.471
We became really close
working together.

14:03.540 --> 14:05.675
How'd you do that?

14:06.644 --> 14:08.311
I'll show you.

14:08.380 --> 14:12.785
We are going to film this one, all right.
That was close. We're gonna try it again.

14:12.786 --> 14:14.186
All right.

14:14.187 --> 14:19.423
Now, on the count, one... (INAUDIBLE)

14:22.194 --> 14:24.629
Look at that,
perfect sleight of hand.

14:25.263 --> 14:29.001
- He was my friend.
- Just friends?

14:29.702 --> 14:32.770
He was more than just my friend.

14:37.009 --> 14:43.315
The tapes that Scarlett brought in
indicated several violent murders

14:43.316 --> 14:46.319
that incriminated Dante
in the disappearance of

14:46.320 --> 14:51.989
at least two of the magician assistants
and her ex-boyfriend Clay Bowland.

14:53.390 --> 14:57.158
Were you aware that Dante
was going to confront Clay?

14:58.629 --> 14:59.930
SCARLETT: No.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.641

What a dick.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.229
I'm sorry.

15:44.677 --> 15:50.014
My shows are something that will
reveal from the darkness great light.

15:52.649 --> 15:55.788
You'll come through doorways that
you didn't even know were there,

15:55.789 --> 15:58.690
and see something unbelievable.

15:58.691 --> 16:02.993
But you have to believe it because
it's right there in front of your eyes.

16:06.598 --> 16:08.201
All right, all right.
Are these guys with you?

16:08.202 --> 16:09.867
No! No! No!

16:11.768 --> 16:14.905
- I'm gonna need your badge number.
- You have the right to remain silent.

16:14.906 --> 16:16.342
Keep rolling, keep rolling.

16:16.343 --> 16:21.109
SCARLETT: The cloak,
when he has it on, he's different.

16:21.979 --> 16:25.451
I can assure you, it's nothing
magical, nothing supernatural.

16:25.452 --> 16:28.219
It's just a sociopath.

16:33.059 --> 16:36.427
Hold on to your tickets.
There's gonna be a big finale.

16:36.428 --> 16:39.065
HUGHES: What I need right
now from you is the truth.

16:39.066 --> 16:42.334
I can't have anymore
stories about magic.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.602
SCARLETT: I'm telling you the truth.

16:58.351 --> 17:04.454
I know now that what he does,
they're not illusions.

17:06.622 --> 17:08.857
It's magic.

17:09.094 --> 17:11.862
There's no such thing as magic.

17:15.468 --> 17:18.267
What is the first rule?
You never tell the brooms...

17:18.268 --> 17:20.170
- how the trick is done.
- I saw what you did.

17:20.171 --> 17:23.175
- What am I supposed to do with you now?
- I know you murdered those women!

17:24.575 --> 17:28.512
- It wasn't me.
- (SCOFFS) Not you?

17:28.513 --> 17:31.981
What is it? What is that then?

17:33.750 --> 17:35.286
Real magic.

17:35.287 --> 17:36.788
SWAT OFFICER: Get down on the ground!

17:36.789 --> 17:38.857
- Get down!
- Down! Down!

Gentlemen.

17:48.934 --> 17:51.869
Welcome... to the show.

17:55.341 --> 17:56.975

18:27.640 --> 18:29.506
