02:07.429 --> 02:09.192
Stop right there.

02:11.099 --> 02:14.091
Security area. "Q" clearance to go by.

02:29.451 --> 02:30.679
Proceed.

03:08.991 --> 03:12.085
Fort Russell's supposed to be
one of our most secure posts...

03:12.160 --> 03:14.390
but they still managed to get in some way.

03:14.496 --> 03:18.364
We were lucky this time no one was killed,
just some damage to this tunnel here.

03:18.467 --> 03:19.900
But whoever it was knew...

03:19.968 --> 03:23.369
just when we'd be transporting
those radar scanner components.

03:23.438 --> 03:25.429
"Q" security's the tightest we have...

03:25.507 --> 03:28.442
yet they still seem to know
just where to hit us.

03:28.510 --> 03:30.842
That unexplained fire at Fort Hughes...

03:30.913 --> 03:34.747
the gas main explosion
at Camp MacKenzie, now this bombing.

03:34.850 --> 03:38.149
All links in what we thought
was a top-secret assembly chain.

03:38.220 --> 03:41.018
Perhaps if we changed
the assembly schedule.

03:41.089 --> 03:42.613
No, it's too late for that.

03:42.691 --> 03:46.627
The scanner is being assembled here
at Fort Russell at three separate locations.

03:46.695 --> 03:48.390
For the enemy to destroy it...

03:48.463 --> 03:51.660
they must strike
before final assembly tomorrow night.

03:51.733 --> 03:55.567
Steve, that doesn't give you much time,
but you have to do it.

03:55.938 --> 03:59.567
You have to make sure
that entire base is 100% secure.

04:01.009 --> 04:03.068
I'll take care of it, sir.

04:04.279 --> 04:05.268
Sir.

04:14.089 --> 04:16.148
I still don't know how they got through.

04:16.224 --> 04:20.627
Security is my business, Major Trevor,
and you'd better believe I'm good at it.

04:20.696 --> 04:23.529
Fort Russell is
spread over 100 square miles...

04:23.598 --> 04:27.295
and nobody crosses one inch of its
perimeter without my knowing about it.

04:27.369 --> 04:28.597
Except this time.

04:28.670 --> 04:31.434
A mistake's been made,
you're going to have to admit it.

04:31.506 --> 04:34.441
- A faulty alarm system, a sleepy guard...
- Negative.

04:34.509 --> 04:37.774
Every link in our security chain
was and is solid.

04:38.046 --> 04:41.709
That saboteur had to be a magician
to get onto these grounds undetected.

04:41.783 --> 04:45.879
- He might have been inside all along.
- There are 15,000 men stationed here.

04:45.954 --> 04:50.220
An enemy agent could hide in the crowd
and wait for his chance to strike.

04:50.292 --> 04:53.125
I've got all personnel
very carefully screened.

04:53.195 --> 04:56.892
There's not a person here who hasn't
been cleared for military purposes.

05:10.946 --> 05:12.937
Does that include them, Colonel?

05:13.015 --> 05:15.347
They don't look very military to me.

05:15.417 --> 05:17.112
Yeoman Prince is 100% right.

05:17.185 --> 05:19.676
What are they doing
at a top-security installation?

05:19.755 --> 05:22.053
They're boosting morale, Major.

05:22.424 --> 05:26.690
The girls are all finalists in
the Miss G.I. Dream Girl Beauty Contest.

05:26.795 --> 05:28.626
They are certainly beautiful.

05:28.730 --> 05:31.028
Yes, it will be tough picking the winner.

05:31.099 --> 05:33.431
The finals are tomorrow
at the Officers' Club.

05:33.502 --> 05:35.663
That's the best place to hold it.

05:35.737 --> 05:38.604
Officers and enlisted men all are invited.

05:40.108 --> 05:43.407
Here they are, boys.
All the little cuties, they're here for you.

05:43.478 --> 05:45.571
You can look at them, but don't touch.

05:45.647 --> 05:47.581
- That's Jack Wood.
- Who?

05:48.216 --> 05:50.776
Only America's favorite radio comic.

05:51.420 --> 05:53.479
He's doing his show here tomorrow.

05:53.555 --> 05:56.956
Emceeing the beauty contest finals
on a coast-to-coast broadcast.

05:58.226 --> 06:00.353
Listen, if you guys still think...

06:00.429 --> 06:03.887
that you're fighting for Mom's apple pie,
see the chaplain.

06:03.965 --> 06:05.227
And go easy on him.

06:05.934 --> 06:07.959
He's always looking for miracles.

06:09.204 --> 06:12.264
Come on, they're all here for you guys.

06:16.211 --> 06:19.703
All right, that's enough, girls.
Come on, it's rehearsal time. Let's go.

06:19.781 --> 06:23.444
See you later, boys. Don't worry about it.
They're all waiting for you.

06:24.386 --> 06:27.514
Do you think it's wise
giving civilians the run of the base?

06:27.589 --> 06:29.523
Jack Wood isn't just a civilian.

06:29.591 --> 06:33.391
He's an institution,
like Bob Hope or Babe Ruth.

06:33.829 --> 06:36.559
Besides, his itinerary's
been cleared by Washington.

06:36.631 --> 06:39.566
Last week he ran a preliminary contest
at Fort Hughes...

06:39.634 --> 06:42.262
four days later,
he did the same at Camp MacKenzie...

06:42.337 --> 06:45.966
and now he's here for the finals and,
believe me, we're glad to have him.

06:46.041 --> 06:49.477
First Fort Hughes, then Camp MacKenzie,
and now Fort...

06:50.378 --> 06:54.576
I presume you've prepared dossiers
on Mr. Wood and his troupe.

06:54.716 --> 06:56.079
I'd like to see them, if I may.

06:56.142 --> 06:58.618
Yes, of course, I'll
get them ready for you.

06:58.687 --> 07:01.178
Fine. I'll meet you in your office.

07:04.326 --> 07:05.918
Yes, I noticed it, too, Diana.

07:05.994 --> 07:08.724
They played every stop
on the sabotage circuit.

07:08.797 --> 07:11.357
It'd make a great cover
for an enemy operation.

07:11.433 --> 07:15.870
Perhaps if we could get one of our own
agents into that beauty contest.

07:16.404 --> 07:18.201
Might flush them out.

07:18.573 --> 07:22.771
Take a really beautiful girl, though,
someone with all the right qualifications.

07:22.878 --> 07:25.278
Well, I'd be willing to try.

07:25.814 --> 07:28.408
Thanks, Diana,
I know you'd do a wonderful job...

07:28.483 --> 07:30.815
but this calls for a really gorgeous girl.

07:30.886 --> 07:33.684
Someone who looks great
in a bathing suit.

07:33.822 --> 07:37.258
I won't be needing you for a while,
is there anything you'd like to do?

07:37.425 --> 07:41.384
I could do some shopping at the PX
and just take a bus back to Washington.

07:41.463 --> 07:43.328
- Lf you don't mind.
- That's fine.

07:43.398 --> 07:44.763
Thank you.

07:48.837 --> 07:51.271
All right, let's try it for real this time.

07:51.339 --> 07:54.206
Monty, one, two, three, four.

07:57.412 --> 07:58.879
Lower the stars.

08:02.017 --> 08:05.646
All together, please. Excellent.

08:09.024 --> 08:10.013
And right.

08:15.063 --> 08:17.031
Very good.

08:19.201 --> 08:21.499
Good. And forward.

08:24.306 --> 08:25.864
And up stage.

08:26.708 --> 08:28.972
Monty, hold it.

08:30.312 --> 08:31.870
Somebody made a mistake.

08:32.447 --> 08:33.436
Come on.

08:34.482 --> 08:36.381
All right, one more time.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.674
From the top.

08:39.254 --> 08:41.847
One, two, three, four.

08:51.499 --> 08:52.488
Mitzie.

09:00.976 --> 09:03.274
- Yes?
- There are no turns in this number.

09:03.545 --> 09:06.878
I'm sorry, I didn't know
there weren't any turns.

09:06.948 --> 09:09.382
- Sorry...
- You're just trying too hard, darling.

09:09.618 --> 09:11.813
At least I know how to smile.

09:11.920 --> 09:14.753
Is that what that is?
I thought it was something you ate.

09:17.592 --> 09:19.560
Will you stop it? Will you cut it out?

09:19.628 --> 09:22.028
- She started it.
- Now let's try it again.

09:22.430 --> 09:24.489
And stop behaving like a herd of sheep.

09:24.566 --> 09:28.161
- Can we take it from the top, please, Lola?
- I'm trying, Monty.

09:29.838 --> 09:31.931
All right, girls, from the top.

09:32.207 --> 09:35.040
One, two, three, four.

09:42.250 --> 09:46.687
Excuse me, but I'd like to find out
about the Miss G.I. Dream Girl Contest.

09:47.255 --> 09:49.951
You're a little late, dear.
There are no more openings.

09:50.025 --> 09:52.653
I never heard of that. She's beautiful.

09:52.794 --> 09:54.284
Listen, I'm Lola Flynn.

09:54.362 --> 09:57.798
I'm running this contest for Jack Wood,
and we sure could use you.

09:57.866 --> 10:01.358
- What's your name?
- Diana. Diana Paradise.

10:01.536 --> 10:05.267
- I'd love to be in your contest.
- It isn't fair to the other girls.

10:05.340 --> 10:07.274
We like things the way they are.

10:07.342 --> 10:09.833
I agree. Besides, we don't know
anything about her.

10:09.911 --> 10:13.438
What's to know? She wants to enter
a beauty contest, not medical school.

10:13.515 --> 10:14.743
We ought to grab her.

10:15.650 --> 10:19.177
- Are you working here on the base?
- Yes, I am just now.

10:19.321 --> 10:23.417
That works fine because you'll have to
be confined with the rest to quarters.

10:23.491 --> 10:26.460
Some dumb regulation
that has to do with security.

10:26.528 --> 10:30.294
I still don't think we should upset
the others for the sake of a late arrival.

10:32.801 --> 10:34.735
Break it up!

10:36.338 --> 10:39.967
Listen, we got a slew of tired G.I. S...

10:40.041 --> 10:42.942
coming here tomorrow night
to look at girls.

10:43.678 --> 10:46.909
Depriving them of this baby doll
would be unpatriotic.

10:47.115 --> 10:48.343
Tell me about yourself, sugar.

10:48.416 --> 10:51.385
Never mind the dull stuff,
get right to your phone number.

10:51.653 --> 10:55.953
But all of us have been working so hard
on our routines for the talent contest.

10:56.257 --> 10:59.055
If she's not prepared,
she'll make us look bad.

11:00.362 --> 11:04.423
The dragon lady's got a point. Can you
sing, dance or play a musical instrument?

11:04.499 --> 11:07.627
Yes. What would you like me to do
for you first?

11:10.505 --> 11:14.407
If I answer that, the draft board
will say that I'm young enough to fight.

11:14.776 --> 11:18.212
How about some hoofing?
Make with the eighty-eights, professor.

11:22.851 --> 11:25.183
One, two, three, four.

11:56.418 --> 11:59.512
Sign her up. I've got to go for now, girls.

11:59.587 --> 12:02.784
I've got a golf date
with my favorite brass hat, Colonel Flint.

12:02.857 --> 12:05.690
His security staff
are the ones protecting you girls...

12:05.760 --> 12:08.092
from the love-starved soldiers
at Fort Russell.

12:08.163 --> 12:10.256
- Boo!
- Bye, girls.

12:10.331 --> 12:12.196
All right, everybody take five.

12:14.869 --> 12:17.804
We've got a lot of work before tomorrow.
When can you start?

12:17.872 --> 12:21.399
This afternoon, if you like.
I have to take care of a few things first.

12:21.476 --> 12:24.104
- Fine. How about 3:00?
- That's fine. Thank you.

12:24.779 --> 12:26.076
- Diana?
- Yes?

12:26.915 --> 12:29.850
I was going to wish you luck,
but you don't need it.

12:29.918 --> 12:33.547
You remind me, kind of, of myself,
a few centuries ago.

12:34.355 --> 12:37.483
It's unfair to judge yourself
by the criterion of age.

12:37.559 --> 12:41.586
A vital, intelligent woman is much more
than the sum of her birthdays.

12:41.729 --> 12:45.392
Yeah, well, maybe it'll be that way for you,
but for me...

12:45.834 --> 12:49.634
my high point was when I was 19
and I was Miss American Beauty.

12:49.704 --> 12:52.901
From then on, it was downhill all the way.
Remember, 3:00.

13:00.648 --> 13:03.139
- You kind of like her, don't you?
- Yes.

13:03.551 --> 13:06.281
I think she isn't
as hard as she would like to be.

13:06.354 --> 13:09.187
Good. It's always nice
to make new friends.

13:09.324 --> 13:12.885
But there'll only be one winner
in the contest, and you're looking at her.

13:12.961 --> 13:15.691
I thought the judges
were going to make that decision.

13:15.763 --> 13:18.323
Just stay out of my way, sweetheart.

13:18.399 --> 13:22.335
I'm going to be Miss G.I. Dream Girl
and be in Jack's next movie...

13:22.637 --> 13:26.971
and anybody who tries to stop me
better watch her step.

13:36.451 --> 13:39.887
So, as you can see, Major, everyone's
been checked and double-checked.

13:39.954 --> 13:44.448
Maybe, but I'm still going to stay with
the inside job theory a little longer.

13:44.792 --> 13:46.487
We'll be in touch.

14:58.032 --> 14:59.932
Let's get out of here.

15:14.415 --> 15:18.078
- Thanks, Wonder Woman.
- They don't seem too dangerous now.

15:19.220 --> 15:23.554
One of these days I'm going to find out
how you always know when I need you.

15:26.861 --> 15:27.987
Let's find out what they know.

15:28.062 --> 15:30.792
- About the sabotage ring.
- They're probably part of it.

15:30.865 --> 15:34.995
Whoever's trying to destroy the scanner
doesn't want me to investigate.

15:35.069 --> 15:37.162
All right, out. Both of you.

15:40.842 --> 15:42.935
What do you know about this scanner...

15:43.378 --> 15:45.346
Wait! They won't go far.

15:49.984 --> 15:51.174
What is this?

15:51.298 --> 15:54.080
It's a little dinky
rope, but I can't move.

15:54.155 --> 15:56.555
No one can resist the Golden Lasso.

15:56.624 --> 15:58.819
It binds all who it encircles...

15:58.893 --> 16:02.056
and compels them to tell the truth.

16:03.097 --> 16:05.930
I can't think of a better time
to ask them a few questions.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.491
Who's leading the attempts
on the scanner project?

16:08.569 --> 16:11.629
We never heard of your project,
whatchamacallit.

16:11.706 --> 16:16.006
We were paid to hit Major Steve Trevor.
$500, no questions asked.

16:16.077 --> 16:19.240
But you had to get the money
and your assignment from someone.

16:19.347 --> 16:20.678
Who was that person?

16:20.748 --> 16:23.080
Nobody. A phone call gave us the job.

16:23.584 --> 16:26.917
The money and instructions
were in a locker at the railroad station.

16:26.988 --> 16:28.455
We don't know anything else.

16:28.523 --> 16:31.856
So the real saboteur hired some
cheap muscle to get me out of the way.

16:31.926 --> 16:35.327
- He must know you're looking for him.
- And he's getting nervous.

16:35.730 --> 16:38.062
He might make
another attempt on your life.

16:38.399 --> 16:42.267
I don't think he'd risk giving himself away
to get me a second time.

16:42.336 --> 16:44.827
He's after the scanner project,
I'll be after him...

16:44.906 --> 16:48.000
as soon as I take them to the police.
In the car, you drive.

16:48.910 --> 16:50.810
Would you rather take your car?

17:10.732 --> 17:12.597
I wonder if you can cook.

17:15.770 --> 17:16.759
In the car.

17:24.112 --> 17:25.579
In the front seat.

17:31.085 --> 17:34.521
- Please be careful.
- I'd like to be, there just isn't time.

17:49.370 --> 17:50.701
Okay, thanks.

17:52.240 --> 17:53.673
I was right.

17:54.008 --> 17:57.239
There's no Diana Paradise
working on this base. She's a phony.

17:57.311 --> 18:00.405
So she made up a fake story
to enter a big-time beauty contest.

18:00.481 --> 18:03.075
I did the same thing
when I was a kid on the make.

18:03.151 --> 18:04.675
Don't worry about it.

18:05.520 --> 18:07.283
I never worry, Lola.

18:07.455 --> 18:10.947
If she's interested in more than
just the beauty contest, it's too bad.

18:11.025 --> 18:12.185
She's had it.

18:24.372 --> 18:27.273
This isn't as easy
as it looks in the movies.

18:27.341 --> 18:30.469
- That's better, chin up, back straight.
- Better?

18:33.147 --> 18:35.638
- Is that really you?
- Yeah, isn't it amazing?

18:35.716 --> 18:38.549
If I thought a wig would do that for me,
I'd shave my head.

18:38.619 --> 18:41.179
The transformation's incredible. But why?

18:41.255 --> 18:44.315
I've entered
the Miss G.I. Dream Girl Contest.

18:45.426 --> 18:46.620
That's wonderful.

18:46.694 --> 18:48.685
I'm using the name Diana Paradise...

18:48.763 --> 18:51.561
so that no one can trace me
to Military Intelligence.

18:52.767 --> 18:53.756
Excuse me.

18:53.935 --> 18:57.393
I think it's great that you're doing this.
It shows a lot of initiative.

18:57.471 --> 19:00.304
Go back to Fort Russell
and keep your eyes open.

19:00.374 --> 19:02.253
I'll to try to get a focus
on this operation.

19:02.254 --> 19:04.333
If I have anything, I'll call you.

19:04.412 --> 19:07.279
I'll say I'm your Uncle George. Clear?

19:07.815 --> 19:09.612
Yes, sir. Uncle George.

19:09.717 --> 19:12.880
I'd better get back to the base now
because I'm expected by 3:00.

19:13.120 --> 19:14.678
I'll drive you.

19:15.423 --> 19:16.412
Thank you.

19:16.958 --> 19:18.926
- Diana?
- Yes, sir?

19:19.093 --> 19:23.427
It's funny, but seeing you in that dress
makes me realize you look like somebody.

19:24.298 --> 19:25.287
Who?

19:27.535 --> 19:29.025
Joan Crawford.

19:30.304 --> 19:32.465
I'm very flattered, sir.

19:32.673 --> 19:34.334
Around the ankles.

19:38.079 --> 19:39.068
Thanks.

19:53.694 --> 19:57.289
- Don't tell me she's still in there.
- So what else is new?

19:58.466 --> 19:59.694
Come on.

20:00.668 --> 20:03.796
Rita, what took so long?
We're all waiting to get in the shower.

20:03.871 --> 20:07.136
It takes her longer,
because she's dirtier than the rest of us.

20:08.142 --> 20:11.509
How would you like to smile for the judges
with no front teeth?

20:13.447 --> 20:15.972
All right, girls, break it up.

20:21.022 --> 20:25.550
Nobody's going to be Miss Dream Girl
with a black eye and a fat lip.

20:26.727 --> 20:29.992
Now, most you kids seem okay,
so if Rita or somebody acts up...

20:30.097 --> 20:32.258
just don't encourage them, all right?

20:32.833 --> 20:34.528
But she's always picking on me.

20:34.602 --> 20:37.400
We just wanted to wash up,
and get a little beauty sleep.

20:37.705 --> 20:39.366
If sleep makes one beautiful...

20:39.440 --> 20:42.204
then all of you
must have had insomnia for years.

20:43.244 --> 20:45.075
One more day.

20:46.013 --> 20:50.609
I'm sorry about the accommodations, but
you're too late for one of the choice bunks.

20:50.685 --> 20:53.552
This will be quite comfortable, I'm sure.
Thank you.

20:53.821 --> 20:55.652
You seem like a nice kid.

20:56.223 --> 20:59.090
- I think I ought to warn you.
- Warn me about what?

20:59.560 --> 21:03.894
There's a lot more at stake here
than a beauty contest for some people.

21:04.131 --> 21:07.464
Don't panic, girls.
I came here to tuck you in.

21:07.702 --> 21:11.160
If any of you get thirsty during the night,
I just...

21:11.272 --> 21:13.069
Yes, go on.

21:13.674 --> 21:17.508
Just do as you're told and be careful.

21:18.479 --> 21:19.810
Extra careful.

21:20.147 --> 21:22.638
Do exactly what I tell you to, all right?

21:25.019 --> 21:27.419
Listen, are they treating
you girls all right?

21:27.488 --> 21:29.718
- Yeah!
- Nuts!

21:29.790 --> 21:33.123
And I wore a rubber shirt
so that you could cry on my shoulder.

21:33.194 --> 21:37.096
There's a few personal things I'd like to
go over with you. It won't take long.

21:37.164 --> 21:38.597
That's what I'm afraid of, honey.

21:38.666 --> 21:41.601
I'd love to get to know you girls better,
but if I do...

21:41.669 --> 21:44.297
people will say
I'm low and corruptible enough...

21:44.372 --> 21:47.273
to trade my vote as a contest judge
for a little smooching.

21:47.908 --> 21:49.773
And they're right.

21:50.044 --> 21:53.036
Front and center! Diana.

21:53.147 --> 21:57.345
- Well, well. How's it going?
- Fine, Mr. Wood...

21:57.418 --> 22:01.252
and I can't thank you enough
for allowing me to become a contestant.

22:01.322 --> 22:04.155
I do. Meet me tonight
on the firing range at 12:00.

22:04.225 --> 22:06.125
Bring an evening gown and bananas...

22:06.193 --> 22:08.787
because, when I monkey around
I use real monkeys.

22:09.363 --> 22:11.661
I didn't know you worked with animals.

22:11.732 --> 22:14.565
Are you kidding?
Didn't you ever see my band?

22:14.802 --> 22:19.364
Oh, boy! Even with all these curves,
this kid would make a great straight man.

22:20.241 --> 22:21.503
Wait a minute.

22:21.709 --> 22:24.803
Why don't I use you
tomorrow night in the magic pit?

22:25.346 --> 22:29.112
That's a good idea. Wait a minute,
let me get some magic props here...

22:29.183 --> 22:33.085
and we're gonna work this out.
Do exactly what I tell you to do, all right?

22:33.554 --> 22:37.046
Just follow me, and hang loose.
Little magic music, please.

22:37.124 --> 22:39.251
Here's what we do. There's the audience.

22:39.326 --> 22:41.726
Hello, how are you?
Here's my pretty assistant.

22:41.796 --> 22:46.256
Hold this, like this. I take this out
and show it to the audience, right?

22:46.333 --> 22:48.631
There. They can see it's completely empty.

22:48.702 --> 22:52.001
I put in here, like this.
Put the top down on the table.

22:52.073 --> 22:56.510
I put it here like this, and suddenly,
abracadabra and what have we got here?

22:59.580 --> 23:01.639
Look at this, she's a natural.

23:02.883 --> 23:04.316
Lola, sign her up.

23:04.385 --> 23:07.411
- Tell Wardrobe to dress her skimpily.
- Right, Jack.

23:07.488 --> 23:10.184
All right, good night, girls.
I'll see you in my dreams.

23:14.462 --> 23:17.260
That magic bit was supposed to be mine.

23:17.331 --> 23:21.700
I told you to stay out of my way,
and right away you cozy up to the star.

23:21.769 --> 23:25.034
- That never entered my mind, Rita.
- No?

23:25.406 --> 23:28.239
Well, let's see how you feel about
this entering your nose!

23:29.610 --> 23:32.636
Rita, knock it off
or you're out of the contest.

23:35.449 --> 23:37.849
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine, thank you.

23:37.918 --> 23:41.479
Diana, there's a phone for you.
It's your Uncle George.

23:41.555 --> 23:43.420
Thank you, Miss Flynn.

23:44.024 --> 23:46.584
Diana, no more personal calls.
It's in the rules.

23:46.994 --> 23:48.052
Yes, ma'am.

23:50.898 --> 23:54.163
- Hello? Uncle George?
- Just listen, Diana.

23:54.468 --> 23:56.993
I've been checking,
and the blast at the tunnel...

23:57.071 --> 23:59.631
wasn't the first attempt
on the scanner project.

23:59.707 --> 24:03.165
The other attempt missed, too.
Damaged a base access road.

24:03.244 --> 24:05.735
It looked like an accident,
so nobody reported it.

24:06.313 --> 24:08.781
That's very interesting,
Uncle George, but...

24:08.849 --> 24:11.079
is there anything else
you wanted to tell me?

24:11.152 --> 24:13.950
I'm not allowed to have
any more personal calls.

24:14.021 --> 24:17.422
- It's in the rules.
- I understand, so I'll make it fast.

24:17.491 --> 24:19.925
The final radar component
will be completed...

24:19.994 --> 24:23.293
at the Fort's electrical sub-station
at 0100 hours tonight.

24:23.364 --> 24:25.730
It's located directly behind the motor pool.

24:25.799 --> 24:28.734
The saboteur has to try for it,
and I'll be waiting for him.

24:28.936 --> 24:32.201
I want you to watch for any activity
in the Jack Wood's group...

24:32.273 --> 24:34.764
that might clue us in
to the saboteur's identity.

24:35.709 --> 24:39.076
- Good hunting.
- Same to you, Uncle George.

24:45.352 --> 24:48.048
I don't know what game
you're playing, sweetheart...

24:48.122 --> 24:52.058
but whatever it is, little Rita's
going to find out all about it.

24:52.760 --> 24:54.091
Excuse me, Rita.

28:02.349 --> 28:04.943
- Steve.
- My head.

28:05.986 --> 28:07.886
They didn't get the scanner, did they?

28:07.955 --> 28:10.515
No, some electrical equipment's
been destroyed...

28:10.591 --> 28:13.424
and someone will have to account
for a missing tailgate...

28:13.494 --> 28:15.223
but the project's all right.

28:15.295 --> 28:17.627
- How are you?
- I'm okay.

28:19.566 --> 28:22.501
The guards are coming. I better go.

28:23.270 --> 28:25.670
But, Wonder Woman, I...

28:30.177 --> 28:34.511
I'm sure everything's under control.
Just go back to bed...

28:34.581 --> 28:37.209
and leave whatever's happening outside
to the Army.

28:37.284 --> 28:41.550
Maybe what's happening was caused
by someone who shouldn't be outside.

28:56.470 --> 28:58.062
Diana's missing.

28:59.139 --> 29:02.199
Diana knows the rules.
I'm sure she's not gone.

29:02.276 --> 29:04.904
Then a search will turn her up, right?

29:13.520 --> 29:14.953
I told you she took off.

29:15.022 --> 29:17.547
She knows the rules,
and she's out of the contest.

29:18.025 --> 29:19.959
What's going on out here?

29:20.027 --> 29:24.191
Diana, I knew you were someplace.
I just never thought of the shower.

29:24.264 --> 29:26.459
It was hot and I couldn't sleep.

29:26.533 --> 29:28.797
What about this? I found it on your pillow.

29:28.869 --> 29:31.804
That's the only thing false about her, Rita.

29:31.872 --> 29:33.396
Can you say the same?

29:35.542 --> 29:39.979
All right, everybody back to sleep.
It's going to be a big day tomorrow.

29:40.581 --> 29:42.742
Good night, again.

29:44.785 --> 29:46.275
Don't turn the light on.

29:59.233 --> 30:01.633
What's going on out there?
It sounds like a war.

30:01.702 --> 30:03.795
An unexpected visit from Wonder Woman.

30:03.871 --> 30:06.135
What's more, our late arrival,
Diana Paradise?

30:06.607 --> 30:10.008
- She's up to something.
- Diana? Are you sure?

30:10.611 --> 30:14.047
- What're you going to do?
- I don't know, but I'll think of something.

30:14.114 --> 30:15.706
I don't want to be involved.

30:16.183 --> 30:18.048
I'm sorry you feel that way, Lola.

30:18.118 --> 30:21.986
Our primary purpose
was not to sabotage the radar project.

30:22.389 --> 30:26.291
It was just a cover to ensure
the success of our real mission.

30:26.360 --> 30:30.956
My dear, we're going to assassinate
a very important general...

30:31.298 --> 30:34.893
named Dwight D. Eisenhower.

30:42.643 --> 30:46.773
I hope General Eisenhower understands
why we had to change the departure time.

30:46.847 --> 30:50.339
I informed the General of the botched
sabotage attempts at Fort Russell.

30:50.417 --> 30:54.410
Nothing to worry about it. You'll just have
to take a longer approach route.

30:55.522 --> 30:58.548
As long as he has time to
check out that special project...

30:58.625 --> 31:01.822
- before it's sent on to New York.
- He'll have plenty of time.

31:01.895 --> 31:03.590
And you also get a bonus.

31:03.664 --> 31:06.758
You can catch the finals
of the Miss Dream Girl contest.

31:06.833 --> 31:09.461
Jack Wood is broadcasting it
from Fort Russell.

31:09.870 --> 31:12.737
That's a good idea.
It's good for the soldiers' morale.

31:13.140 --> 31:16.075
Good for the officers' morale, as well.

31:18.545 --> 31:22.606
Sabotage try one: Closed an access road.
Two: Shut down the tunnel.

31:22.950 --> 31:25.851
Three: Last night, blew up
part of the electrical system...

31:25.919 --> 31:28.183
that services the fort's auxiliary airfield.

31:28.255 --> 31:30.450
At least they didn't
wreck the radar scanner.

31:30.524 --> 31:32.958
- That's the important thing.
- Is it?

31:33.060 --> 31:35.893
How can an agent clever enough
to penetrate our defenses...

31:35.963 --> 31:38.261
miss his target three times out of three?

31:38.565 --> 31:41.898
Good news, Steve. We've won.
The radar scanner's completed.

31:41.969 --> 31:44.164
The components
are being assembled now...

31:44.237 --> 31:47.570
so the device will be operational
in time for his personal inspection.

31:47.641 --> 31:48.972
Whose inspection, sir?

31:49.042 --> 31:52.534
An officer the War Department is high on,
name of Eisenhower.

31:52.613 --> 31:57.277
Sorry to keep you in the dark about that,
but he's involved in some top-level stuff.

31:57.351 --> 32:00.946
We considered his travel plans so
important, no one was supposed to know.

32:01.021 --> 32:04.081
Like the radar scanner.
But the enemy still knew about it.

32:04.558 --> 32:08.858
General, what route is Eisenhower
taking to Fort Russell?

32:08.929 --> 32:10.260
- His route?
- Yeah.

32:10.330 --> 32:12.890
Well, originally he was to stop
at Fort Hughes...

32:12.966 --> 32:14.866
for a special debriefing session...

32:14.935 --> 32:16.994
with a Special Forces officer
of Camp MacKenzie.

32:17.070 --> 32:20.005
Cancelled because of
accidents at both installations.

32:20.073 --> 32:22.541
A fire at Hughes,
a gas main blow-up at MacKenzie.

32:22.609 --> 32:25.373
So Eisenhower is forced to come
directly to Fort Russell.

32:25.445 --> 32:27.572
I repeat, sir, by what route?

32:28.382 --> 32:31.408
A plane from Randolph Field
to the auxiliary landing strip...

32:31.485 --> 32:34.386
Closed by sabotage
to the electrical system.

32:35.255 --> 32:38.088
Then south on the access road
through the service tunnel.

32:38.158 --> 32:41.889
But, sir, the road and the tunnel
were closed by sabotage, too.

32:41.962 --> 32:44.294
Leaving the only route into Fort Russell...

32:44.364 --> 32:48.767
a landing at this civilian airstrip
west of the perimeter...

32:48.835 --> 32:52.669
and the fire road behind the old
artillery range entering the base at...

32:53.507 --> 32:54.633
Point Lobo.

32:54.708 --> 32:57.506
- A perfect spot for an ambush.
- Good Lord.

32:57.978 --> 33:00.811
It wasn't the radar scanner
the saboteurs were after.

33:00.881 --> 33:04.783
They were creating a funnel through
which Eisenhower had to enter the fort.

33:05.085 --> 33:07.918
Etta, call Diana
at the Officers' Club theater.

33:07.988 --> 33:11.287
Say Uncle George has an urgent message,
and tell her what happened.

33:11.358 --> 33:15.954
We'll alert Point Lobo and the Fort by
car radio on our way to the landing site.

33:16.263 --> 33:18.197
We've got to try and head him off.

33:25.972 --> 33:29.464
Communications?
Gen. Blankenship's priority clearance.

33:29.876 --> 33:33.107
I have to place a call
to the theater at Fort Russell right away.

33:38.185 --> 33:41.279
I just feel there's something
not right about Diana Paradise.

33:41.354 --> 33:44.915
This is a beauty contest, and she's
a pretty girl. What's wrong with that?

33:44.991 --> 33:48.552
You know what I mean. She's not
interested in some dumb beauty contest.

33:48.628 --> 33:51.461
If that's the way it is,
that'll be the end of her.

33:51.531 --> 33:55.092
Monty, I've told you, I don't want to hear
you talking that way anymore.

33:55.168 --> 33:58.433
All right, girls, let's take a look
at the costumes.

33:59.740 --> 34:03.676
They all look fine. Better hurry
and get into your bathing suits.

34:04.411 --> 34:07.505
That costume should be mine.
It doesn't even look right on her.

34:07.581 --> 34:12.518
We've no time for that. They're lining up,
and Jack's warm up is in 20 minutes.

34:12.819 --> 34:15.447
Come on, girls, let's get going.

34:22.795 --> 34:24.422
Officers' Club Theater.

34:25.232 --> 34:27.199
Diana Paradise? Hold on.

34:38.812 --> 34:40.143
Hello?

34:42.616 --> 34:44.583
Operator, we've been cut off.

34:46.119 --> 34:48.485
The call was for me, my Uncle George.

34:51.525 --> 34:55.120
No personal calls, Miss Paradise.
No exceptions.

34:57.931 --> 35:00.024
Whatever you say, Mr. Burns.

35:10.877 --> 35:15.075
Fella, would you lower the PA?
We're getting feedback on the speakers.

35:21.021 --> 35:23.489
Watch it, this thing weighs a ton.

35:23.557 --> 35:26.651
If it ever came down,
somebody could get killed.

35:32.799 --> 35:34.630
Somebody could get killed.

35:49.683 --> 35:54.382
It's no use, Steve. We have 15 miles to go.
Eisenhower's plane is in radio silence.

35:54.454 --> 35:57.116
Then we must reach him
before he starts for Point Lobo.

35:57.190 --> 36:00.216
- Blankenship, here.
- General, it's Etta. I can't reach Diana.

36:00.293 --> 36:03.694
- They're not answering the phone.
- Get an M.P. To get you to theater.

36:03.763 --> 36:05.663
Tell her in person, fast!

36:05.732 --> 36:08.724
Yes, sir, but it'll be too late for Diana
to do anything...

36:08.802 --> 36:11.737
and she'll be worried
about you and General Eisenhower.

36:12.105 --> 36:16.439
Sir, I know this isn't very military,
but I hate a crisis situation.

36:16.676 --> 36:20.134
- Pull yourself together, Etta.
- Yes, sir.

36:20.513 --> 36:21.980
Over and out.

36:22.749 --> 36:24.046
Step on it, Steve.

36:24.384 --> 36:27.581
Okay, fella. Take it up,
will you? That's it.

36:28.755 --> 36:30.985
The place is filling up with soldiers.

36:31.057 --> 36:34.549
Monty, what you said about Diana...
You won't do anything, will you?

36:34.728 --> 36:35.922
Don't worry.

36:36.529 --> 36:37.860
It'll be over quickly.

36:40.767 --> 36:44.430
I can't let that happen.
That's got to be stopped, now.

36:44.504 --> 36:48.270
That's not possible, Lola. First,
because you're in this up to your neck...

36:48.341 --> 36:51.902
and, second, because it's too late.
It's already started.

36:52.412 --> 36:54.277
My men are in position by now.

38:08.221 --> 38:11.748
The main attraction, ladies and gentlemen,
for your pleasure and mine...

38:11.825 --> 38:14.953
your Miss G.I. Dream Girl.

39:21.261 --> 39:23.058
Aren't they lovely?

39:24.097 --> 39:27.863
They're all dream girls,
each and every one of them.

39:34.507 --> 39:37.704
His plane's already landed.
Maybe he's still here.

39:45.085 --> 39:47.076
We missed him. He can't be far ahead.

39:47.153 --> 39:50.054
I hope it's not too late.
If Point Lobo doesn't respond...

39:50.123 --> 39:52.421
that trap could be set already.

40:01.701 --> 40:05.193
Yes, sir. That's something
they'll never replace with synthetics.

40:05.271 --> 40:07.000
Isn't she wonderful?

40:08.374 --> 40:10.205
The girls will show the judges...

40:10.276 --> 40:14.337
that they've got something
going for them besides beauty: Me!

40:14.414 --> 40:18.043
But seriously, folks, this is
the talent part of our competition...

40:18.118 --> 40:20.780
and our next contestant,
direct from New York City...

40:20.854 --> 40:24.881
the very lovely, vivacious
Miss Betty Lou Capaletti...

40:24.958 --> 40:27.290
in her own fantasy in dance!

40:27.360 --> 40:29.487
Let's hear it for Betty Lou!

40:34.501 --> 40:35.763
Where are you going?

40:35.835 --> 40:38.929
I've got to see Diana Paradise.
It's a matter of life or death.

40:39.005 --> 40:41.530
Sorry, but you'll have to wait
till after the show.

40:41.908 --> 40:44.570
I said, after the show.

40:48.982 --> 40:49.971
Excuse me.

40:50.049 --> 40:53.314
Miss Flynn, I can't find my costume
for the number with Mr. Wood.

40:53.686 --> 40:55.244
It's not in my locker.

40:55.321 --> 40:57.846
It's got to be.
You had it on at dress rehearsal.

40:57.924 --> 41:01.223
I hate to be the one to say it,
but where is Rita right this minute?

41:01.294 --> 41:04.195
I mean, she doesn't have
to change until next to last.

41:08.835 --> 41:11.827
How about that
for a double-jointed baby doll?

41:12.105 --> 41:15.632
Honey, fold yourself up and
wait for me in my glove compartment.

41:17.443 --> 41:20.776
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
it's my turn.

41:21.014 --> 41:23.278
I'm not going to get to you with beauty...

41:23.349 --> 41:26.216
but I've still got a couple of things
going for me.

41:26.519 --> 41:30.080
This is one of them, and this is the other.

41:30.290 --> 41:32.224
Here I am, Mr. Wood.

41:36.663 --> 41:39.530
It is Rita. She's taken my place.

42:23.843 --> 42:26.812
I may as well get ready
for the evening gown parade.

42:26.980 --> 42:29.744
You can't go through with this.
You're making a mistake.

42:29.816 --> 42:32.614
Lola, you leave me with no alternative.

42:35.588 --> 42:38.580
See how easy it is
to get rid of you, my dear?

43:18.097 --> 43:21.396
You can talk about your big finish,
but this is ridiculous.

43:21.834 --> 43:23.699
What's going on here?

43:23.770 --> 43:26.466
The Jack Wood Show spares no expense.

43:26.906 --> 43:30.034
Nice to see you, Wonder Woman,
but I'm sorry, I do a single.

43:30.109 --> 43:33.408
Mr. Wood, it is very important
that no one leave this theater.

43:33.479 --> 43:35.140
I won't argue with you, doll.

43:35.214 --> 43:38.945
You've got to admit, this is better than
army training films on athlete's foot.

43:48.461 --> 43:50.361
Wonder Woman, am I glad to see you.

43:50.430 --> 43:53.456
I must find Diana to tell her
what's happened, but she isn't here.

43:53.533 --> 43:55.330
- What happened?
- It's terrible.

43:55.401 --> 43:59.667
- Is it Steve? Major Trevor?
- Yes. No. It's partly him.

43:59.739 --> 44:01.900
Mostly it's about General Eisenhower.

44:01.974 --> 44:05.137
The sabotage was just a trick
to hide an attempt on his life.

44:05.211 --> 44:08.203
Steve's trying to head him off now
on the road to Point Lobo.

44:16.522 --> 44:18.183
It's Eisenhower all right.

44:22.795 --> 44:25.025
He's not alone.
There's a car following him.

44:30.670 --> 44:33.264
We're being tailed, sir.
I'll try to outrun them.

44:33.573 --> 44:36.667
They're making a run for it.
They don't know who we are.

44:47.620 --> 44:49.485
That's Morse code, General.

44:49.555 --> 44:53.924
T-R-E-V-O-R!

44:54.327 --> 44:55.794
Stop the car.

45:04.270 --> 45:07.000
Sorry to show up this way,
but you're headed into an ambush.

45:07.073 --> 45:10.770
You were funneled onto this road
by sabotage. You must turn back at once.

45:21.921 --> 45:25.448
We can hold our own from this position
as long as our ammunition lasts.

45:25.525 --> 45:28.153
We'll have to get smart, or lucky.

45:32.064 --> 45:33.861
Look, it's Wonder Woman.

45:35.435 --> 45:38.962
There's our luck, General, and it never
came in a more beautiful package.

46:21.080 --> 46:22.445
Are you all right?

46:22.515 --> 46:26.645
If they gave merit badges for being
fantastic, you'd be an Eagle Scout!

46:26.719 --> 46:28.016
How did you find us?

46:28.087 --> 46:31.818
Etta told me what happened,
but this is not over yet.

46:34.460 --> 46:38.055
I think Monty Burns is behind this,
and he's escaped.

46:38.130 --> 46:40.257
Not far from here is an M.P. Phone box.

46:40.333 --> 46:44.099
As soon as we get them to mop up here,
we'll take care of your Mr. Burns.

46:47.139 --> 46:48.663
There! On the hill!

47:16.569 --> 47:20.130
And that's the story of what's happened
here this evening, boys and girls.

47:20.373 --> 47:23.467
And now, since it's a beauty contest
that you've come to see...

47:23.543 --> 47:27.673
I think it's time that you get to look
at the one and only winner possible.

47:27.747 --> 47:29.271
Here she is:

47:29.348 --> 47:31.839
Wonder Woman!

47:57.476 --> 48:00.172
I still don't understand
what happened to Diana, Steve.

48:00.246 --> 48:03.545
- She was supposed to be in the contest.
- It's simple, Etta.

48:03.616 --> 48:05.914
When she found
Wonder Woman was competing...

48:05.985 --> 48:08.317
the poor kid probably threw in the sponge.

48:08.387 --> 48:10.355
But what woman wouldn't?

48:11.991 --> 48:14.221
Wonder Woman is just too much.

48:22.168 --> 48:23.601
Yes, Gen. Blankenship.

48:24.503 --> 48:25.834
That's wonderful.

48:26.706 --> 48:28.901
Thank you, sir. Goodbye.

48:31.477 --> 48:34.776
Monty Burns and his entire ring
have been arraigned in Washington.

48:35.348 --> 48:37.976
The radar scanner's already
a smashing success...

48:38.050 --> 48:41.816
and Gen. Eisenhower has nominated
Wonder Woman for a special citation.

48:42.955 --> 48:46.550
What about Lola Flynn?
I feel rather sorry for her.

48:46.859 --> 48:49.384
Her cooperation is being considered
in her favor.

48:49.729 --> 48:53.187
But espionage during wartime
is still a very serious offence.

48:53.466 --> 48:56.697
Jack Wood is trying to get her leniency.
He's hard to say no to.

48:56.769 --> 48:58.100
I'm glad.

48:58.571 --> 49:01.631
I've got to finish these requisition forms
you requested.

49:01.707 --> 49:03.538
We're running low on graph paper.

49:03.609 --> 49:07.409
Graph paper? Is that all
you can think of after all that's happened?

49:07.480 --> 49:11.576
Being in a beauty contest
and meeting Jack Wood in person?

49:11.651 --> 49:14.449
And the ambush of Gen. Eisenhower,
and Wonder Woman and...

49:14.520 --> 49:17.785
It's no use, Etta.
Our Diana is strictly business.

49:17.857 --> 49:21.418
But maybe one of these days,
she'll get tired of missing all the fun.

49:21.761 --> 49:24.423
And when that happens,
I'd love to be around.

49:26.565 --> 49:29.432
You will be, Major. That's a promise.

50:26.659 --> 50:27.648
