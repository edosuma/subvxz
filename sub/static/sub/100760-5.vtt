00:06.006 --> 00:08.342
There's my little guy.
How you doing?

00:08.384 --> 00:10.720
- You eating enough?
Mom, I think
I fucked up my bowtie.

00:10.761 --> 00:12.972
In a minute, dear.
I am talking to your brother.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.932
Why are you so dressed up?

00:14.974 --> 00:17.143
- Don't tell him.
- Semiformal.

00:17.184 --> 00:19.353
I'm going with Mikaela,
my girlfriend.

00:19.395 --> 00:21.731
- You have a girlfriend?
- Mm-hmm.

00:21.772 --> 00:24.315
She's really nice,
and she's got a little sister

00:24.316 --> 00:25.985
that was the age you were...

00:27.445 --> 00:28.946
that you were when...

00:28.988 --> 00:33.075
Mom, it's been six years.

00:33.117 --> 00:36.036
-My 19th birthday's
in three months.
-I know,

00:36.078 --> 00:37.830
- I just, I just...
- Talk to him later?

00:37.872 --> 00:39.290
She's gonna be here any minute.

00:39.331 --> 00:40.666
- Okay.
- Jesus.

00:40.708 --> 00:41.876
I got to go, sweetie.

00:41.917 --> 00:43.377
But I'm gonna
call you right b...

00:51.594 --> 00:54.013
You know, Ingrid, normally,
couples therapy works best

00:54.054 --> 00:56.182
when there's just one therapist.

00:56.223 --> 00:58.976
It's only divorce attorneys
that you both need your own.

00:59.018 --> 01:01.145
I-I want to be open-minded,

01:01.187 --> 01:04.148
but I just don't feel
comfortable opening up

01:04.190 --> 01:07.693
to a CGI dog with only a
master's degree in social work.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.653
Yes, we looked you up,

01:09.695 --> 01:11.030
Ernie Lampsterman.

01:13.616 --> 01:15.659
Wow. Hope you guys are happy.

01:15.701 --> 01:18.037
Ingrid, would you like to share

01:18.078 --> 01:20.039
what's upsetting you
about Nathan?

01:20.080 --> 01:21.332
He's just so...

01:23.250 --> 01:25.586
You are constantly pulling away.

01:25.628 --> 01:29.298
I'm trying to make this work,
but you are so distant.

01:29.340 --> 01:30.508
Look, I'm not trying to be.

01:30.549 --> 01:31.777
Okay? But sometimes,
it feels like

01:31.801 --> 01:33.344
I don't have
my own life anymore.

01:33.385 --> 01:35.429
You know? I'm-I'm just
this plaything for Ingrid,

01:35.471 --> 01:36.889
there when she wants me.

01:36.931 --> 01:38.516
- That's not true.
- You control

01:38.557 --> 01:40.434
all my purchases,
what I do, what I eat.

01:40.476 --> 01:43.938
Ooh. The skinny jeans came in.

01:43.979 --> 01:45.815
See? She's literally
dressing me like a doll.

01:45.856 --> 01:47.149
I'm sorry, okay?

01:47.191 --> 01:48.543
I thought the skinny jeans
would look good on you.

01:48.567 --> 01:50.110
So I'll just return them.

01:50.152 --> 01:52.321
Personally,
I love the skinny jeans.

01:52.363 --> 01:53.864
Thank you so much.

01:53.906 --> 01:56.158
I can feel my pulse
in my thighs.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.202
â™ª â™ª

02:08.921 --> 02:11.274
It's hard for me to let you win
if you won't take your turn.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.384
Whatever. I don't care.

02:13.425 --> 02:16.595
- Okay. What's going on?
- My parents won't update
my avatar.

02:16.637 --> 02:19.682
It's like I'm repeating
sixth grade over and over again.

02:19.723 --> 02:23.310
I was born 18 years ago,
and I don't have ball hair.

02:24.353 --> 02:25.855
Aww.

02:25.896 --> 02:28.482
I mean, they want to keep you
the way they remember you.

02:28.524 --> 02:29.817
Then there's this.

02:29.859 --> 02:32.069
My little brother

02:32.152 --> 02:34.196
going with a girl
to some semiformal

02:34.238 --> 02:35.823
dumb-shit dance.

02:35.865 --> 02:38.701
This is his second girlfriend.

02:38.742 --> 02:40.369
He's lapping me.

02:40.411 --> 02:41.996
Hey, it's not a race.

02:42.037 --> 02:43.914
Most men don't get that.

02:43.956 --> 02:45.332
Hey, girl.

02:45.374 --> 02:47.960
You looking damn fine.

02:48.002 --> 02:49.211
Excuse me?

02:49.253 --> 02:51.130
Did somebody lose their child?

02:52.172 --> 02:53.549
See what I mean?

02:53.591 --> 02:55.342
If I had the body
that went with my age,

02:55.384 --> 02:57.761
- I would wreck that ass!
- Okay, okay,

02:57.803 --> 02:59.263
you need to calm down.

02:59.305 --> 03:00.556
I get that you're frustrated,

03:00.598 --> 03:01.825
but you can't come on
that strong.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.643
If I came on
as strong as I feel,

03:04.685 --> 03:07.438
I'd pound a hole
in the fabric of Lakeview.

03:07.479 --> 03:11.984
Sometimes I'm glad I'm sitting
safely behind this screen.

03:12.026 --> 03:14.945
Nathan was dying, okay?
His vitals,

03:14.987 --> 03:17.865
they were fading, and-and
my grandma lives in Lakeview.

03:17.907 --> 03:20.176
Right? So, uh, so all of the
pieces just sort of fit together

03:20.200 --> 03:21.827
in this really nice way.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.580
See? Without Ingrid,
you wouldn't even be here today.

03:24.622 --> 03:26.683
Yeah, well, Fran said my vitals
were starting to go back up

03:26.707 --> 03:28.083
right before I uploaded.

03:28.125 --> 03:29.543
That's not true, is it?

03:29.585 --> 03:31.545
With deep respect,
Fran is a moron.

03:31.587 --> 03:33.088
Just tell me if it's true.

03:33.130 --> 03:35.007
I don't know.

03:35.049 --> 03:36.050
You don't know?

03:36.091 --> 03:37.927
I'm... Maybe. I mean, I don't...

03:37.968 --> 03:39.803
I don't know.
I-I... I-It could be true.

03:39.845 --> 03:41.347
I-I noticed something
was going up,

03:41.388 --> 03:43.140
but-but I didn't really know
what it meant.

03:43.182 --> 03:46.018
What the fuck, Ingrid? I'm dead.

03:46.060 --> 03:47.937
I didn't want to lose you.

03:47.978 --> 03:49.939
No.

03:49.980 --> 03:52.816
You didn't care if I died, you
just didn't want to be alone.

03:54.276 --> 03:57.488
God... Pants!

03:57.529 --> 03:59.698
Okay, well,

03:59.740 --> 04:02.201
I have you
for another 20 minutes.

04:04.787 --> 04:06.497
Sorry.

04:06.538 --> 04:07.748
Yep.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.586
Oh, fuck.

04:12.628 --> 04:14.380
That's mine. Pay up, son.

04:14.421 --> 04:15.506
Take it.

04:15.547 --> 04:16.924
Hey! Hey, there.

04:16.966 --> 04:19.468
Uh, do you want to join in
on this action?

04:19.510 --> 04:21.470
Guess what? I'm not even
supposed to be here.

04:21.512 --> 04:22.888
She's with someone, thank you.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.765
Can it. My vitals
were going back up.

04:24.807 --> 04:27.017
- Ingrid saw and...
- I said she's
with someone, asswipe.

04:27.059 --> 04:28.185
Take a hint.

04:28.227 --> 04:29.436
Whoa.

04:29.478 --> 04:31.063
Settle. Geez.

04:31.105 --> 04:33.524
I think Nathan just heard
some disturbing news.

04:33.565 --> 04:36.318
- Yeah, you think?
- Nobody feels like
they should be here.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.028
Do you think I wanted
to fall into the Grand Canyon?

04:39.029 --> 04:41.573
Wait, that's how you died?

04:41.615 --> 04:44.576
They should expect people to try
and break the glass floor.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.370
They should design for it.

04:46.412 --> 04:48.539
I saw that video.
You dabbed on the way down.

04:48.580 --> 04:51.000
Well, yeah.
That's how you get the likes.

04:52.459 --> 04:55.754
See? You two cool guys
can be friends.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.340
- Aww, thanks, Mom.
- Hey, kid, you want to hit

04:58.382 --> 05:00.360
hit the Search Bar? I want to
put something on Ingrid's tab.

05:00.384 --> 05:01.719
Bourbon, neat.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.679
Root beer, cold.

05:03.721 --> 05:05.597
Let's go.

05:07.099 --> 05:08.976
Swipe right.

05:09.018 --> 05:10.728
Beautiful teeth.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.396
Oh, Sascha. Hello, there.

05:15.024 --> 05:16.233
No. God, no.

05:16.275 --> 05:18.610
Are you on Nitely?

05:18.652 --> 05:21.113
Nitely is only

05:21.155 --> 05:23.282
for living people
to hook up with one another.

05:23.323 --> 05:26.076
No living woman wants to hook up
with your dead, catfishing ass.

05:26.118 --> 05:27.453
Okay, okay.

05:27.494 --> 05:28.787
Geez.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.456
I was just browsing,
for old time's sake.

05:30.497 --> 05:31.665
A guy can look.

05:31.707 --> 05:33.542
I'm watching you, dead boy.

05:40.716 --> 05:41.884
Yep.

05:41.925 --> 05:44.553
Yeehaw! Let's go, let's go!

05:44.595 --> 05:46.072
- Oh, you're cheating.
- Faster, faster.

05:46.096 --> 05:47.306
What is happening?

05:50.976 --> 05:53.062
That was dope.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.314
- Again.
- Let's go.

05:56.899 --> 06:01.945
Voice mail for customer service
employee 11-55-C.

06:01.987 --> 06:04.364
Hey, honey.

06:04.406 --> 06:07.326
It's Dad.
I'm at Cuomo Memorial.

06:08.911 --> 06:10.913
Damn lungs again.
Thought I'd let you know.

06:10.954 --> 06:14.208
- My gosh. Dad.
- You should go to him, right?

06:14.249 --> 06:16.502
Uh, I'm supposed to be
taking care of Dylan, uh...

06:16.543 --> 06:18.063
No, no. Don't worry about him.
I got this, okay?

06:18.087 --> 06:20.297
- Go to your dad.
Yeah.
Do what you got to do.

06:20.339 --> 06:22.466
- We cool.
- Okay. Thanks.

06:22.508 --> 06:24.885
T-This is, this is
such a big help.

06:24.927 --> 06:26.929
Uh, take some Lakeview Bucks
just in case.

06:33.435 --> 06:35.020
Oh, ho, oh...

06:35.062 --> 06:37.231
Buddy, buddy,
I matched us with two nines.

06:37.272 --> 06:39.501
- What are you talking about?
- I made us fake Nitely accounts,

06:39.525 --> 06:42.069
and we got these swipe-rights
in no time.

06:42.111 --> 06:44.738
Hot, spicy.
I'll take the tall one.

06:44.780 --> 06:47.032
Dude, you're, like, four.
I'm showing my wingman.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.076
I-I can't.
I'm on babysitting duty.

06:49.118 --> 06:51.328
I'm helping my angel
with a personal emergency.

06:51.370 --> 06:53.288
And also, Ingrid.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.183
We're supposed to meet them
on the hotel floors.

06:55.207 --> 06:57.126
That's where the living meet
to party in VR.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.686
Uploads aren't allowed
on hotel floors.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.754
Thanks, Sheriff Short.

07:00.796 --> 07:02.649
That's why we're going
to the Grey Market first,

07:02.673 --> 07:04.716
to pick up a hack
to force our way down.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.218
Grey Market? Hell yeah.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.387
- Take me.
- Yeah, right.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.698
- Wait, what's the Grey Market?
- Oh, a hacker like you
would love it.

07:10.722 --> 07:13.225
You can get anything there.
No rules.

07:13.267 --> 07:16.854
Oh, that is intriguing,
but I can't. I made a promise.

07:16.895 --> 07:19.481
Come on, Nathan.
Don't be a loser.

07:19.523 --> 07:21.358
Please! Come on. Please.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.545
-Nathan, look at me.
I need this, man. I need it.
-Come on.

07:23.569 --> 07:24.879
- Please. I need it.
- Please, Nathan.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.172
- Come on. Please, man. Please.
- Come on.

07:26.196 --> 07:27.757
- Please, please, please!
- Please, Nathan, come on.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.300
- Please, Nathan! Please!
- Please, Nathan, please?

07:29.324 --> 07:31.326
- Please, Nathan, oh, my God...
- For God's sake!

07:31.368 --> 07:33.370
Nathan, just take them.

07:35.330 --> 07:37.207
Okay, fine, a quick trip.

07:37.249 --> 07:38.584
- Yes! Yeah!
- Yes!

07:39.835 --> 07:42.296
So where exactly are we going?

07:42.337 --> 07:45.632
- Off the map. I guess
you'd call it the dark web.
- Uh-huh.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.384
Yeah, there's
this super secret place

07:47.426 --> 07:49.386
you can pass through the hedge.

07:49.428 --> 07:50.679
Can you spot it?

07:56.727 --> 07:58.687
Gentlemen, can I help you?

07:58.729 --> 08:00.272
This area's off-limits.

08:00.314 --> 08:02.774
No, no... sir? Sir.
Little sir, no, seriously.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.776
Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.004
No, no, seriously,
it's dangerous.

08:06.028 --> 08:08.030
Mr. Brown?

08:08.071 --> 08:09.448
Whoa.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.701
Horizen will not be held liable
for any avatar corruption!

08:12.743 --> 08:14.119
We're not playing!

08:14.161 --> 08:16.121
I-I could get through this hedge

08:16.163 --> 08:17.789
any time I want.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.875
And I just don't want to today.

08:25.631 --> 08:28.091
Okay. Nothing to be
scared of here, guys.

08:28.133 --> 08:29.718
Hmm? What's that, Dylan?

08:29.760 --> 08:32.387
You think we should hold hands
so nobody gets lost?

08:32.429 --> 08:34.181
Fine.

08:34.223 --> 08:36.225
I didn't say anything, wuss.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.229
What's with the numbers?

08:40.270 --> 08:42.105
You have, like,
a lot of questions.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.899
It's for our locator pings.

08:43.941 --> 08:45.251
Lakeview keeps track
of all uploads

08:45.275 --> 08:47.027
by pinging us every hour.

08:47.069 --> 08:49.255
If we're off the map, we don't
ping back, the system assumes

08:49.279 --> 08:52.074
- we've been erased.
- Then what?

08:52.115 --> 08:54.427
I heard your avatar disappears
and your consciousness wanders

08:54.451 --> 08:56.286
the Grey Zone
for all of eternity.

08:56.328 --> 08:59.373
So let's hurry up
and get there, huh?

09:02.125 --> 09:04.586
If I'm an invisible
consciousness,

09:04.628 --> 09:08.173
I'm gonna go up people's noses
and out their butts like a fart.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.092
I like the way you think.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.385
There.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.595
That's it?

09:22.646 --> 09:25.107
Oh, man.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.279
This is sick.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.075
Just see!
'Sup, kid?

09:35.117 --> 09:36.368
Uh-oh.

09:36.410 --> 09:37.744
Bad smells for sale!

09:37.786 --> 09:39.413
- Fuck off.
- Bad smells for sale!

09:39.454 --> 09:41.707
- Hey, boys.
- We got sweat, dirty pennies

09:41.748 --> 09:43.208
and a hot chick's
morning breath.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.209
All fresh.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.335
Sure you're 18?

09:45.377 --> 09:48.505
18 and three quarters, dickbag.

09:55.679 --> 09:57.347
Here we go.

09:57.389 --> 09:59.808
Two Lakeview elevator hacks.

09:59.850 --> 10:02.561
Ooh! Trying to party
with some living ladies, huh?

10:04.187 --> 10:05.939
I'll throw in
some antivirus to be safe.

10:05.981 --> 10:08.483
Can you make it quick?
We're on a time crunch.

10:08.525 --> 10:09.901
Can I go look around?

10:09.943 --> 10:13.322
This is the most action
I've ever gotten.

10:13.363 --> 10:15.115
I mean, we do have 40 minutes.

10:15.157 --> 10:17.200
Just stay close, okay?

10:17.242 --> 10:19.286
We're always watching you.

10:19.328 --> 10:20.871
Celebrity memories!

10:20.912 --> 10:22.706
I got real celebrity memories
here, people!

10:22.748 --> 10:24.124
Pulled moments after upload.

10:24.166 --> 10:25.417
Drake pooping.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.586
The sad end
of Sir Justin Bieber.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.713
Huh? Hey, hey.

10:29.755 --> 10:31.757
I got PenÃ©lope Cruz
in the shower.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.342
Huh?

10:33.383 --> 10:34.676
This is stupid.

10:34.718 --> 10:36.762
You're stupid.
Those pants are dumb.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.323
What do you keep in there,
Teddy Grahams?

10:38.347 --> 10:39.723
Fuck off, you fat nerd.

10:39.765 --> 10:41.266
Bite me, Tiny Tim.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.518
- Oh, easy, easy, easy. Okay.
- Come on!

10:43.560 --> 10:44.853
Come on. Come on.

10:44.895 --> 10:46.772
How would you like to hack

10:46.813 --> 10:48.523
into a living person's
wrist phone camera?

10:48.565 --> 10:50.317
Ten seconds for 100 coins.

10:50.359 --> 10:51.318
Interesting.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.944
Are you kidding me?

10:52.986 --> 10:55.280
I've seen 100 different
sex bot shops,

10:55.322 --> 10:57.616
- and this is where
you want to go?
- Okay.

10:57.657 --> 10:58.742
How 'bout Jamie Arpaz,

10:58.784 --> 11:00.160
my old business partner?

11:00.202 --> 11:02.579
2-1-3-5, ampersand sign,

11:02.621 --> 11:04.581
7-5-3-2-8-1-9-2.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.627
So, you see, the best part is,

11:08.668 --> 11:11.129
the design costs nothing

11:11.171 --> 11:13.131
because the uploads
build their own homes.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.801
- How?
- As Josh said,

11:15.842 --> 11:17.219
my software is unique

11:17.260 --> 11:18.512
and proprietary.

11:18.553 --> 11:20.055
Huh.

11:20.097 --> 11:21.807
What is he up to?

11:21.848 --> 11:23.642
We got 12 minutes left.
Let's roll.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.561
Where's the kid?

11:26.603 --> 11:28.063
Oh, shit.

11:28.105 --> 11:29.648
He was right here. Dylan?

11:29.689 --> 11:31.316
Dylan?!

11:31.358 --> 11:33.235
Man, I can't believe
your angel trusted you.

11:34.444 --> 11:37.030
- Dylan! Dylan!
- Dylan! Dylan!

11:43.120 --> 11:44.746
Hello, visitor.

11:44.788 --> 11:47.874
The patient is suffering
from chronic vape lung.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.918
Noncontagious.

11:51.169 --> 11:52.879
Mr. Antony,

11:52.921 --> 11:54.714
we simply can't keep meeting
like this.

11:54.756 --> 11:57.509
Well, I don't think
we will be much longer.

11:57.551 --> 11:59.511
Dad, come on.

11:59.553 --> 12:03.265
I don't want to run up a-a stack
of bills like when Mom died.

12:03.306 --> 12:06.351
Y-You had to skip college.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.270
Can you imagine me as a lawyer?

12:08.311 --> 12:10.564
Yeah.
It was your dream.

12:10.605 --> 12:14.568
You went as Gloria Allred
three Halloweens in a row.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.448
I just want you to be happy.

12:19.489 --> 12:23.201
It's been nothing but sickness
and crap for too long.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.704
We're still here.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.873
Together. Right now.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.749
That makes me happy.

12:33.211 --> 12:35.881
Oh, I hate to leave you alone.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.674
Well, you wouldn't
if you uploaded.

12:37.716 --> 12:40.302
Oh. Oh,
I've seen the commercial.

12:43.972 --> 12:45.765
I go on dates.

12:45.807 --> 12:48.143
I mean,
there's a guy I might like.

12:48.185 --> 12:50.395
- Ooh.
- Okay.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.731
There's nothing yet.
We're just friends.

12:54.024 --> 12:55.192
It's kind of long-distance.

12:55.233 --> 12:56.651
How long-distance?

12:56.693 --> 12:58.236
Long.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.362
What's he do?

13:00.405 --> 13:03.617
He's in computers.

13:03.658 --> 13:05.368
Is he there for you?

13:05.410 --> 13:07.204
I mean, can you really count
on the guy?

13:08.246 --> 13:10.624
Yeah.

13:10.665 --> 13:12.584
I think I can.

13:12.626 --> 13:14.044
- Dylan!
- Dylan!

13:14.085 --> 13:16.838
Dylan!

13:16.880 --> 13:18.924
- Fuck!
- Dylan!

13:18.965 --> 13:21.009
Dylan?!

13:21.051 --> 13:22.320
How could you have brought
a child here?

13:22.344 --> 13:23.720
What is wrong with you?

13:23.762 --> 13:24.721
Dylan!

13:24.763 --> 13:26.848
Dylan?! Dylan?!

13:26.890 --> 13:30.018
- Yeah, man!
- Dylan?!

13:30.060 --> 13:32.062
There. There, there, there.
There.

13:32.103 --> 13:34.314
You didn't tell me
this would hurt.

13:34.356 --> 13:35.315
You want hair
where you were telling me,

13:35.357 --> 13:36.691
you better hold still.

13:36.733 --> 13:39.027
- Hey, Dylan, we got to go. Now.
- In a minute.

13:39.069 --> 13:40.737
No, now. You'll just have
half a tattoo.

13:40.779 --> 13:41.988
It's not a tattoo.

13:42.030 --> 13:44.449
- It's a puberty power-up.
- A what?

13:44.491 --> 13:45.784
What the hell does that mean?

13:45.825 --> 13:47.285
Just some code
to age up his avatar.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.496
I got it off
a top-notch Russian hacker.

13:49.538 --> 13:51.122
Next time he falls asleep,

13:51.164 --> 13:54.000
he'll wake up with adult parts.
And... done.

13:54.042 --> 13:56.253
- Great. Okay, we are
one ping away from annihilation.

13:56.294 --> 13:57.629
- Come on.
- Uh-uh-uh-uh.

13:57.671 --> 13:59.089
600 Facebook Libras.

13:59.130 --> 14:01.383
Fuck.

14:01.424 --> 14:03.218
Stupid pants.

14:03.260 --> 14:05.095
- Great. Okay.
- Hey, see

14:05.136 --> 14:07.055
if those Nitely girls
have a friend for me!

14:07.097 --> 14:09.683
- Like a babysitter?
- You motherfucker!

14:24.614 --> 14:25.824
Cafeteria's that way.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.451
Oh, actually,
I had a question about scanners.

14:28.493 --> 14:32.247
Do these machines ever damage
memories by accident?

14:32.289 --> 14:33.498
Never.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.125
They're, uh...

14:35.166 --> 14:36.960
glorious, really.

14:37.002 --> 14:38.604
You can watch the life
of a squirrel beat for beat

14:38.628 --> 14:39.868
if you put one in this machine.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.591
Not that I ever have.

14:42.632 --> 14:45.760
Uh, what if I happen
to know, uh,

14:45.802 --> 14:47.721
an upload with damaged memories?

14:47.762 --> 14:49.556
Then it wouldn't be
the machine's fault.

14:49.598 --> 14:51.516
It's always whoever designed
the avatar.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.561
Those low-wage clowns,
they mess up all the time.

14:54.603 --> 14:57.731
Well, actually,
I made the avatar.

14:57.772 --> 14:58.857
Oh.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.818
Are there
any other possibilities?

15:01.860 --> 15:03.320
Somebody somewhere
is probably...

15:03.361 --> 15:05.280
up to some kind of fuckery.

15:05.322 --> 15:08.908
Well, is there anything
I can do to fix the memories?

15:08.950 --> 15:11.286
I used .Mem Restore,
and I got a couple watchable.

15:11.328 --> 15:13.163
- .Mem Restore.
- Mm-hmm.

15:13.204 --> 15:16.875
Why not just throw your money
directly down the toilet?

15:16.916 --> 15:19.919
The only consumer app that
isn't shit is Memboost Turbo.

15:19.961 --> 15:21.588
I have a download card
you can use.

15:21.630 --> 15:24.007
It'll work on any device.

15:24.049 --> 15:25.717
Oh, thanks.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.510
Are you sure?

15:27.552 --> 15:31.473
Of course. This is the longest
conversation I've had in years.

15:31.514 --> 15:33.600
Go!

15:33.642 --> 15:35.143
Guys!

15:39.939 --> 15:41.316
Go, go, go, go.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.532
Oh. Oh, okay. Nap time.

15:49.574 --> 15:51.368
I'll drop him off at his room.

15:51.409 --> 15:52.410
Don't be long.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.953
Here's your hotel level pass

15:53.995 --> 15:55.789
for 4006.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.332
Meet you at the bar.

15:57.374 --> 15:58.559
And don't change out
of the skinny jeans.

15:58.583 --> 15:59.542
You look amazing.

15:59.584 --> 16:01.169
Stop.

16:01.211 --> 16:03.630
You think so?

16:05.131 --> 16:07.759
Yeah, you're all tuckered out,
huh, buddy?

16:07.801 --> 16:09.010
You had a big day.

16:09.052 --> 16:10.512
Ew, ew. Drool.

16:10.553 --> 16:12.138
Drool, drool. Gross.

16:12.180 --> 16:14.724
Yuck.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.228
Okay.

16:18.269 --> 16:20.939
And, uh...

16:20.980 --> 16:22.124
I don't know.
People do this, right?

16:22.148 --> 16:23.191
Here you go.

16:25.068 --> 16:27.070
This is great. Perfect.

16:37.872 --> 16:39.207
4006.

16:39.249 --> 16:40.458
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.140
Uploads are not allowed
on the hotel fl...

16:45.380 --> 16:46.840
And away we go!

17:05.984 --> 17:07.402
â™ª Can I get an "H" â™ª

17:07.444 --> 17:08.403
â™ª For Horizen? â™ª

17:08.445 --> 17:10.447
â™ª â™ª

17:16.244 --> 17:18.872
â™ª I say, "A," you say, "I" â™ª

17:18.913 --> 17:20.540
â™ª Artificial DJ say,
"Here we go" â™ª

17:20.582 --> 17:22.125
â™ª Let's go, let's go,
let's go! â™ª

17:22.167 --> 17:23.668
Yes!

17:28.590 --> 17:30.049
Hey. All right.

17:30.091 --> 17:31.968
- Uh-huh. Hi. Mwah.
- Hi.

17:32.010 --> 17:34.053
And, uh... and you

17:34.095 --> 17:35.597
are for my friend.

17:35.638 --> 17:37.432
Do you want a drink?

17:51.988 --> 17:54.365
â™ª â™ª

17:54.407 --> 17:56.284
My buddy will be here
any minute.

17:56.326 --> 17:57.619
You want to dance?

17:57.660 --> 18:00.205
I don't want
to leave Chloe alone.

18:00.246 --> 18:02.707
Of course. Cool.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.209
Yeah.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.461
Hey, so tell me more

18:06.503 --> 18:09.214
about your coworker
who uses your mug.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.340
That shit is bananas.

18:10.381 --> 18:12.175
- Yeah. Karen.
- God.

18:12.217 --> 18:14.594
- She's a bitch. She's...
- Karen, learn to read.

18:14.636 --> 18:16.763
- Your name's on it.
- The worst.

18:16.805 --> 18:19.098
Yeah.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.608
Shh.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.987
I'll be right back.

18:35.490 --> 18:37.742
You didn't tell me

18:37.784 --> 18:39.327
your dad was this rich.

18:39.369 --> 18:41.204
I'd have proposed by now.

18:41.246 --> 18:43.206
And powerful.

18:44.666 --> 18:46.125
President Reagan
gave this to my dad

18:46.167 --> 18:47.418
when he was in college.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.754
It's his favorite thing
in the world.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.173
That's including me.

18:53.675 --> 18:56.052
This bottle's old enough
to be my grandfather.

18:56.094 --> 18:59.389
Mm-hmm. He was saving it
for a special occasion.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.573
â™ª â™ª

19:35.216 --> 19:37.760
Hey, um, Batia?

19:37.802 --> 19:39.637
Do you ever go on my computer?

19:40.680 --> 19:42.807
That is serious accusation.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.851
I will take lie detector.

19:44.893 --> 19:46.978
Oh, you-you don't have to.
I-I was just wondering

19:47.020 --> 19:50.607
'cause I-I seem to have lost
some files in this one folder.

19:50.648 --> 19:52.025
I will take lie detector.

19:52.066 --> 19:54.277
No one can control their skin.

19:54.319 --> 19:55.904
Yeah.

19:55.945 --> 19:57.488
Okay.

20:00.241 --> 20:02.118
Dude, where are you?
Did you know

20:02.160 --> 20:04.120
that Sascha got downsized
to a smaller cubicle

20:04.162 --> 20:05.872
because her boss
has it in for her?

20:05.914 --> 20:08.499
Because I do.
I'm doing all the heavy lifting

20:08.541 --> 20:10.543
myself. Grooming tools down.

20:10.585 --> 20:12.378
I'm not grooming.

20:12.420 --> 20:15.006
I'm taking a shit.

20:15.048 --> 20:16.424
Hurry up.

20:36.611 --> 20:38.071
Oh.

20:39.197 --> 20:40.198
Yes.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.825
So it begins.

20:44.285 --> 20:47.538
First stop:
the ladies by the pool.

20:49.123 --> 20:51.084
I like your style.

20:51.125 --> 20:53.294
Yo, thank you.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.636
Can I help you with something?

21:03.096 --> 21:04.555
That's what I fucking thought.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.057
Oh, dear.

21:06.099 --> 21:09.227
Um, uh, you may need
to cover up, please?

21:09.268 --> 21:10.496
- What the fuck?
- Perhaps you'd be
more comfortable...

21:10.520 --> 21:12.105
I'm going for a swim, dork.

21:12.146 --> 21:13.690
- Please, j-just...
- Get off.

21:13.731 --> 21:15.108
Angel!

21:15.149 --> 21:19.070
And then, with no warning,
he's like, "Leesha,

21:19.112 --> 21:21.864
- the bichon frise
has been sick all week."

21:21.906 --> 21:24.784
I'm like, "Yeah, 'cause
you keep feeding it Raisinets."

21:24.826 --> 21:25.785
Get off!

21:25.827 --> 21:26.911
Dylan?

21:26.953 --> 21:28.871
- Just...
- Get the fuck off of me.

21:28.913 --> 21:29.914
Oh, shit.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.547
Shit. Hey.

21:37.588 --> 21:39.674
I trusted you.

21:39.716 --> 21:40.967
Who's this, now?

21:41.009 --> 21:42.176
This is Dylan.

21:42.218 --> 21:43.803
- What?
- Yeah. Heard all about

21:43.845 --> 21:45.596
your little field trip
to the Grey Zone.

21:45.638 --> 21:48.266
Turns out the puberty patch
was female.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.476
- Oh.
- You guys effed up.

21:50.518 --> 21:52.228
Dude, biology 101.

21:52.270 --> 21:53.980
It says "XX," not "XY."

21:54.022 --> 21:55.374
How am I supposed to know?
I thought it just meant

21:55.398 --> 21:56.792
he's gonna be, like,
extra, extra manly.

21:56.816 --> 21:59.777
- Oh, hey...
- Haven't you
ever seen boobs before?

21:59.819 --> 22:01.738
The... They're for
feeding babies.

22:01.779 --> 22:04.699
- Yummy.
- Oh, grow up. Creep.

22:04.741 --> 22:06.909
- Yikes. I'm-I'm really sorry.
- Mm.

22:06.951 --> 22:09.746
This has Luke's
greasy fingerprints all over it.

22:09.787 --> 22:11.581
Where is that
Hurt Lockin' asshole?

22:13.958 --> 22:15.585
Found him.

22:15.626 --> 22:17.670
And he's right where
he's not supposed to be.

22:18.671 --> 22:21.257
I'm really sorry.

22:35.396 --> 22:36.814
Oh, fuck.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.816
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

22:38.858 --> 22:41.360
I told you to keep your dead ass
away from our living visitors.

22:41.402 --> 22:43.905
Ma'am, do you know
he's an upload

22:43.946 --> 22:45.323
from our
permanent resident floors?

22:45.364 --> 22:47.158
She doesn't care.
She thinks that's hot.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.285
- Wait, what? You're an upload?
- Mm-hmm.

22:49.327 --> 22:51.370
Yeah. No, that's fine.
That's totally cool.

22:51.412 --> 22:53.247
I can totally handle that.
That's not weird.

22:53.289 --> 22:54.665
That's not weird.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.250
No, it's not weird.

22:56.292 --> 22:58.711
Will you excuse me just a min...

23:08.471 --> 23:11.015
Get your ass back upstairs.

23:15.019 --> 23:18.856
So, do you want to,
you know, make out?

23:18.898 --> 23:20.733
Greg, dinner!

23:20.775 --> 23:21.984
Coming, Ma!

23:22.026 --> 23:24.028
Just fucking
with some dead people.

23:25.780 --> 23:29.033
Wh-Wh... Why?

23:29.075 --> 23:30.795
Well, this was the move
of a true douchebag.

23:30.827 --> 23:32.203
I know. I'm sorry.

23:32.245 --> 23:34.664
I'm sorry, dude... ette.

23:34.705 --> 23:35.915
Poor kid.

23:35.957 --> 23:38.501
Dylan, we all know
that gender's a spectrum,

23:38.543 --> 23:41.170
so if this is your way of,
you know, telling us

23:41.212 --> 23:43.923
that this body is more in line
with your identity inside,

23:43.965 --> 23:45.758
that-that is just great.

23:45.800 --> 23:48.636
And I'm sure
we both support you.

23:48.678 --> 23:50.513
- Yes, of course. 100%.
- No.

23:50.555 --> 23:52.140
I can tell this is not me.

23:52.181 --> 23:54.475
Can you just change me back,
please?

23:54.517 --> 23:57.979
Okay. But it's gonna take me
hours to reprogram,

23:58.020 --> 23:59.605
so are you sure?

23:59.647 --> 24:01.190
Yeah, I'm sure.

24:01.232 --> 24:02.900
Right.

24:02.942 --> 24:07.196
Well, next time, I'll leave you
with real grown-ups.

24:07.238 --> 24:09.866
Oh, how's your dad? Fuck.

24:09.907 --> 24:11.284
Smooth.

24:18.499 --> 24:20.918
Those golfers staring at me

24:20.960 --> 24:23.087
was definitely the worst part.

24:23.129 --> 24:24.714
Yeah, I can imagine.

24:24.755 --> 24:27.675
I bet a lot of girls
feel that way sometimes, too.

24:27.717 --> 24:29.510
You know,
when guys are only interested

24:29.552 --> 24:31.637
in their bodies.

24:31.679 --> 24:36.058
I guess everybody wants
to be treated like a person.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.894
Yeah.

24:37.935 --> 24:40.897
Oh...
fuck, I missed your titties?

24:40.938 --> 24:42.607
They're the talk of the lobby.

24:42.648 --> 24:44.650
Hey, not cool, man.

24:44.692 --> 24:46.444
Oh. Sorry. My bad.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.738
Why do they have
to program me so horny?

24:48.779 --> 24:50.573
I'm sure they'd remove it
if they could.

24:50.615 --> 24:53.367
Then why make
our angels so freaking hot?

24:53.409 --> 24:55.703
Mine has legs
that just won't quit.

24:55.745 --> 24:58.831
You know, I was only a woman
for a couple of hours,

24:58.873 --> 25:00.458
but that's demeaning.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.460
I bet when you didn't have legs,

25:02.501 --> 25:04.170
you didn't want that
to be the only thing

25:04.212 --> 25:05.504
people noticed about you.

25:05.546 --> 25:07.048
Okay, PC Police.

25:07.089 --> 25:08.883
I'll come back
when you're fixed.

25:08.925 --> 25:10.384
You know,

25:10.426 --> 25:13.846
I may still only have
a 12-year-old's body,

25:13.888 --> 25:15.348
but I'm more mature than Luke.

25:15.389 --> 25:16.849
Definitely.

25:16.891 --> 25:19.518
But that's
a pretty low bar, kid.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.567
Call Josh Pitzer.

25:26.609 --> 25:28.486
Hello, Mr. Pitzer.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.446
Just confirming
we're still on for 5:00.

25:30.488 --> 25:32.049
This is the third time
you've called to confirm.

25:32.073 --> 25:33.282
We're still on.

25:33.324 --> 25:34.784
I'll see you in two minutes.

25:49.966 --> 25:51.676
Huh.

25:52.885 --> 25:54.303
Car?

25:54.345 --> 25:56.097
Car, what-what are you doing?

25:56.138 --> 25:59.183
Stop. Stop.

25:59.225 --> 26:01.185
Obey me!

26:03.354 --> 26:04.939
The heck?

26:04.981 --> 26:07.358
What's that noise?

26:07.400 --> 26:08.985
We're on wood?

26:09.026 --> 26:10.820
No, no, no. Car.

26:10.861 --> 26:12.530
Car.

26:12.571 --> 26:15.116
Car, stop!

26:15.157 --> 26:17.410
Oh, thank God.

26:20.579 --> 26:21.747
Call for help.

26:21.789 --> 26:23.916
Okay? Call your mom.

26:23.958 --> 26:25.626
Something is wrong
with my car, okay?

26:25.668 --> 26:28.296
Did you hear me? Call for help.

26:28.337 --> 26:29.505
Yeah. Or... No, no, no.

26:29.547 --> 26:31.716
Don't move. Damn it!

26:32.800 --> 26:35.386
No!

26:35.428 --> 26:36.512
Stop!

26:36.554 --> 26:38.806
Wait, wait! No!

26:38.848 --> 26:42.310
Stop!
