RESTRICTED ACCESS

01:25.502 --> 01:26.586
What took you so long?

01:53.488 --> 01:55.782
I shouldn't have told him to wait.

02:00.203 --> 02:04.332
Had he come to the hospital right away,
they would've tried surgery at least.

02:07.001 --> 02:08.878
I shouldn't have said I'd go to him.

02:11.673 --> 02:12.674
Hae-won.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.556
And you, if you didn't think
you could make it,

02:20.765 --> 02:22.600
you should've told me so.

02:28.606 --> 02:30.608
He waited for three hours at the terminal.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.363
We shouldn't have made him wait that long.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.076
I know.

02:42.287 --> 02:43.413
It's my fault.

02:44.914 --> 02:46.499
No. I…

02:47.584 --> 02:48.751
So tell me.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.463
Where were you then?

02:55.216 --> 02:56.718
Where were you?

02:57.886 --> 03:01.347
Where in the world were you?

03:06.686 --> 03:08.646
Were you with Hui-ju?

03:20.658 --> 03:22.827
You must be nuts!

03:22.911 --> 03:24.537
How could you do this to me?

03:24.621 --> 03:25.830
It's driving me nuts!

03:26.789 --> 03:29.000
I don't know
what the hell is wrong with me!

03:35.381 --> 03:37.216
I keep seeing someone else in her.

03:45.683 --> 03:47.268
You crazy bastard.

04:13.086 --> 04:16.923
EPISODE 10
POINT OF NO RETURN

04:23.054 --> 04:26.808
FUNERAL HOME
REST IN PEACE

04:36.317 --> 04:39.529
Didn't he come to the wedding recently?

04:40.071 --> 04:41.823
He looked so healthy.

04:41.906 --> 04:43.950
That's life.

04:44.033 --> 04:46.953
We all look well and healthy right now,

04:47.036 --> 04:49.789
but any one of us can die at any moment.
You never know.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.959
Please excuse me. I'll meet you inside.

05:02.093 --> 05:04.554
Ms. Lee called
and asked me to come with her.

05:05.513 --> 05:07.307
And I thought it was only right to.

05:07.807 --> 05:10.351
I know you loved
your grandfather very much.

05:11.269 --> 05:12.478
Stay strong.

05:13.062 --> 05:14.105
I am

05:14.939 --> 05:17.942
doing my best to stay strong right now.

05:20.194 --> 05:22.864
Right, of course. I'm sorry.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.366
For what?

05:27.410 --> 05:29.746
There are many things
you should be sorry about.

05:35.626 --> 05:37.337
I'm not here to fight.

05:37.420 --> 05:40.840
What then? Are you here to comfort me?

05:42.467 --> 05:44.093
Do you feel bad for me now?

05:46.804 --> 05:50.308
I shouldn't have come and upset you.

05:50.391 --> 05:51.267
I'm sorry.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.145
That's a shame.

05:55.730 --> 05:58.149
Because you no longer
have the right to be sorry.

06:00.777 --> 06:03.071
When I had asked you to apologize,

06:04.739 --> 06:07.950
I was still willing to forgive you.

06:09.702 --> 06:12.580
-But now--
-It's not the time to talk about that.

06:13.623 --> 06:14.832
I should go.

06:15.917 --> 06:16.793
No.

06:17.752 --> 06:19.045
This is the right time.

06:20.922 --> 06:24.884
Because you just apologized to me
when you don't have the right to.

06:27.345 --> 06:30.264
You had numerous chances
to ask for my forgiveness.

06:30.348 --> 06:32.975
And you chose to do it now
when I'm at my lowest.

06:33.643 --> 06:37.105
You sound like you're doing me a favor.
I won't accept it.

06:39.357 --> 06:41.442
I'm sure you'd like to think

06:41.526 --> 06:44.654
that your trivial apology
has settled all the issues between us.

06:46.155 --> 06:48.407
But I won't allow that.

06:52.703 --> 06:56.374
I despise you.

06:57.333 --> 07:00.586
And you'll see me time after time.

07:02.630 --> 07:07.051
Wherever you are,
I will follow you tirelessly.

07:09.428 --> 07:11.347
It'll be a living hell,

07:12.723 --> 07:14.600
so I hope you live a long life

07:15.143 --> 07:17.645
and die all alone.

07:46.215 --> 07:48.176
HWAIN GALLERY
REST IN PEACE

08:25.880 --> 08:26.797
Leave.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.635
Don't give me that tormented look--

08:36.474 --> 08:39.018
If you're going to stay here like that,

08:40.561 --> 08:41.395
just leave.

08:44.565 --> 08:45.441
Hae-won.

08:48.069 --> 08:49.111
Just leave.

09:33.197 --> 09:34.323
What is it?

09:34.824 --> 09:36.200
Did you have a nightmare?

09:37.201 --> 09:38.202
Yes.

09:38.786 --> 09:39.996
Come here.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.378
Was it a scary nightmare?

09:47.461 --> 09:50.131
Goodness. My baby.

11:07.541 --> 11:08.959
<i>Grandpa.</i>

11:09.794 --> 11:12.880
<i>If I have any good left in me,</i>

11:15.007 --> 11:16.258
<i>it's all</i>

11:17.635 --> 11:19.470
<i>from you.</i>

12:34.545 --> 12:36.881
<i>How are you these days? Are you busy?</i>

12:37.590 --> 12:39.258
<i>Take care of yourself.</i>

12:39.341 --> 12:41.218
<i>And come see me when you have time.</i>

12:42.511 --> 12:45.097
<i>Jeong-yeon, did you have lunch yet?</i>

12:45.181 --> 12:48.058
<i>I thought of you while eating,
so I thought I'd ask.</i>

13:04.116 --> 13:05.159
Eat.

13:08.537 --> 13:10.539
I don't deserve to.

13:14.710 --> 13:15.753
Eat.

13:16.879 --> 13:19.507
He forgot
about all the bad things you did.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.425
He only remembered the good things.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.180
As if I ever did anything good.

13:27.014 --> 13:28.224
You gave birth to me.

13:30.267 --> 13:32.019
He said that alone was enough.

13:32.102 --> 13:33.729
He was proud of you.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.565
He said that many times.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.694
-Really?
-Really.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.198
So eat.

13:46.033 --> 13:48.494
He hates it when we skip meals.

13:49.161 --> 13:53.123
He grew these bean sprouts
to make you some hangover soup.

14:07.429 --> 14:10.266
Why did you put in so much garlic?
It's so bitter.

14:10.849 --> 14:12.142
So you'd turn into a human.

14:12.226 --> 14:13.477
You little…

14:16.188 --> 14:19.149
What's he doing? Your husband.

14:19.650 --> 14:23.320
He didn't say a word
and looked miserable during the funeral.

14:23.404 --> 14:26.156
I want to go easy on him
because he's handsome, but then…

14:27.741 --> 14:28.659
I don't like him.

14:43.757 --> 14:47.386
<i>I didn't hate you. I liked you.</i>

14:52.141 --> 14:55.144
Do you remember?

14:55.227 --> 14:56.937
No, I still don't.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.649
So I need you to tell me.

15:01.150 --> 15:04.653
Did I have feelings for you?

15:08.532 --> 15:09.617
Briefly.

15:11.201 --> 15:12.578
Very briefly.

15:13.787 --> 15:18.834
When you and Hae-won were having
a hard time while preparing to go abroad,

15:19.752 --> 15:21.128
we had a fling.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.006
I didn't mention it
since it was nothing serious.

15:24.089 --> 15:25.841
Are you saying I left Hae-won

15:26.592 --> 15:28.135
due to a trivial fling?

15:31.221 --> 15:33.432
Only you know the answer to that.

15:33.515 --> 15:35.476
Then what about you?

15:35.559 --> 15:36.894
Did you also

15:38.270 --> 15:40.022
have feelings for me?

15:51.325 --> 15:52.785
<i>That was in the past.</i>

15:52.868 --> 15:55.454
<i>Even if I hated you in the past,</i>

15:55.537 --> 15:57.081
<i>I don't hate you now.</i>

15:57.164 --> 15:58.832
<i>Actually, I'm concerned about you.</i>

16:27.069 --> 16:30.239
Sir, we had the latest model ready
like you asked.

16:33.617 --> 16:35.828
-I like it. I'll take it.
-Yes, sir.

16:36.412 --> 16:37.955
This will suit her.

16:39.206 --> 16:40.040
This way, please.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.259
He'll be released soon?

16:50.342 --> 16:54.430
Ms. Gu's lawyer recently requested
a review on the legality of his arrest.

16:55.305 --> 16:58.017
She also mentioned
that his young daughter was living alone.

16:59.768 --> 17:02.271
She must have one competent lawyer.

17:04.857 --> 17:05.983
And the agreement form?

17:06.066 --> 17:10.112
It'll take some time
since she recently lost her father,

17:10.195 --> 17:11.697
but there won't be any problem.

17:11.780 --> 17:12.865
She lost her father?

17:15.492 --> 17:17.327
She must have a lot on her mind.

17:18.287 --> 17:19.246
Wait…

17:39.808 --> 17:42.186
-Hey.
<i>-Why aren't you home yet?</i>

17:42.269 --> 17:44.813
<i>We're supposed to have
a family dinner every Sunday.</i>

17:44.897 --> 17:46.774
I'm on my way. It won't take long.

17:48.734 --> 17:52.488
Salmon sounds great. Okay.

19:06.186 --> 19:09.273
Nowadays, the parents decide
on a theme that their kids like.

19:09.356 --> 19:12.234
Then the event manager
prepares everything for them.

19:12.776 --> 19:14.194
How convenient.

19:16.738 --> 19:20.200
You should still pick the party favors
yourself, so Ho-su doesn't feel bad.

19:21.285 --> 19:22.703
The party favors?

19:22.786 --> 19:25.914
Is that needed for a kid's birthday party?

19:29.001 --> 19:30.752
At Ji-ho's birthday party,

19:30.836 --> 19:33.463
Ji-ho's mom read a storybook to the kids.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.924
It was nice.
You should try something similar.

19:37.509 --> 19:39.636
As if she read anything
when she was little.

19:40.304 --> 19:42.556
That's why I'm grateful to you.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.058
My kids are able

19:45.142 --> 19:49.271
to experience things I wasn't able to
when I was little. Thank you.

19:49.354 --> 19:51.064
Stop distracting us and sit down.

19:58.030 --> 20:01.158
Right. About Mr. Seo Woo-jae…

20:03.785 --> 20:05.579
Why do you look so surprised?

20:05.662 --> 20:08.540
You asked about him.
He's doing much better.

20:09.124 --> 20:11.543
He may regain his memories.

20:13.962 --> 20:16.798
I see. That's a relief.

20:28.977 --> 20:30.312
Hello.

20:35.192 --> 20:36.777
You should at least say hi.

20:38.028 --> 20:40.948
After all, I'm Ms. Lee's assistant
for the upcoming project.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.249
I'll tell her myself

20:50.332 --> 20:52.793
that I'm uncomfortable
working with a married couple.

20:52.876 --> 20:56.004
No one else at the gallery
has time to assist her.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.464
That's why she hired me.

20:57.547 --> 20:59.883
Hiring an assistant isn't difficult.

21:01.468 --> 21:04.680
Right. How is Mr. An doing?

21:05.764 --> 21:09.268
I'd like to thank him
for settling things with Mr. Lee.

21:09.351 --> 21:12.020
Since when did you care
how my husband was doing?

21:14.314 --> 21:15.732
Don't worry.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.652
I won't be seducing your husband.

21:22.948 --> 21:26.034
I want you to also feel the pain
of having the most precious person

21:26.118 --> 21:27.953
stolen from you.

21:29.329 --> 21:31.331
But I don't think that's him.

21:34.835 --> 21:38.338
He's not precious to you.
You just need him.

21:40.048 --> 21:41.800
Can you please stop?

21:41.883 --> 21:43.552
You're the one who should stop.

21:43.635 --> 21:47.431
What if Woo-jae regains his memories
while you keep feigning ignorance?

21:50.559 --> 21:53.020
Why are you making things so complicated?

21:53.520 --> 21:55.647
Why don't you just tell everyone about it?

21:55.731 --> 22:00.068
Tell them that your husband abandoned you.
Though I doubt anyone would believe you.

22:00.152 --> 22:01.695
I don't want to do that.

22:01.778 --> 22:03.905
It'll only become
something to gossip about.

22:03.989 --> 22:07.826
Exactly. If you were so hurt
by people gossiping about that,

22:07.909 --> 22:10.078
you should've stayed away from me.

22:10.162 --> 22:13.123
Why the hell did you show up
with Woo-jae in front of me?

22:14.875 --> 22:16.668
Do you want to turn back time?

22:17.461 --> 22:19.171
What difference will that make?

22:20.547 --> 22:22.591
Just tell me what you want.

22:23.091 --> 22:24.801
Why waste your life like this?

22:24.885 --> 22:26.345
What will you get in return?

22:29.056 --> 22:33.435
At the very least,
you'll feel the pain I felt.

22:36.354 --> 22:38.648
So you want me to be miserable as well?

22:40.275 --> 22:41.860
You're really…

22:44.654 --> 22:46.239
so pathetic.

23:04.716 --> 23:06.885
<i>-Excuse me.</i>
-Yes?

23:07.719 --> 23:10.263
Hey, Woo-jae. How have you been?

23:10.347 --> 23:11.515
What brings you here?

23:12.224 --> 23:16.478
Well… Have you been in touch
with Hae-won lately?

23:16.561 --> 23:18.980
I doubt any of us are in touch with her.

23:19.773 --> 23:22.317
I thought you'd know what she was up to.

23:23.360 --> 23:24.486
Thanks.

23:26.530 --> 23:27.364
SCULPTURE DEPARTMENT

24:25.046 --> 24:25.964
Woo-jae.

24:52.991 --> 24:54.492
What are you doing here?

25:05.003 --> 25:07.380
How did you find me?

25:07.964 --> 25:11.051
I told you. I'm good at finding you.

25:13.386 --> 25:15.138
Answer my question.

25:17.474 --> 25:20.143
I met Yeong-jae, your schoolmate.

25:21.102 --> 25:23.563
I was wondering
if he knew anything about us.

25:23.647 --> 25:26.233
But he said you left school
and cut ties with him,

25:26.316 --> 25:27.817
and asked me about you.

25:27.901 --> 25:29.361
You wasted your time.

25:30.111 --> 25:33.490
How would they know something
that even you and I don't know?

25:33.573 --> 25:35.200
Then tell me what you know.

25:35.951 --> 25:38.203
You always tell me
about the good memories we had.

25:38.286 --> 25:39.746
But we're human.

25:39.829 --> 25:42.499
If things were always rosy,
why did we turn out this way?

25:45.418 --> 25:46.878
How did we turn out?

25:49.881 --> 25:51.758
We haven't seen each other in five days.

25:52.509 --> 25:54.803
Shouldn't you ask how I'm doing first?

26:03.228 --> 26:04.396
Let's go.

26:04.479 --> 26:07.190
Ms. Lee wants to know
how much progress you've made.

26:27.043 --> 26:29.045
Have you been staying here all along?

26:29.129 --> 26:32.132
It didn't feel right
to go home without you.

26:33.049 --> 26:34.301
So I slept here.

26:34.801 --> 26:36.761
I guess you felt guilty

26:36.845 --> 26:39.514
thinking about someone else
in the house we share together.

26:45.437 --> 26:46.604
No excuses?

26:49.941 --> 26:52.902
Do you know why we had the wedding?

26:58.074 --> 27:00.076
So that I could hold you down.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.622
You're officially a married man now.

27:06.541 --> 27:09.085
I can't stop you
from having feelings for someone else,

27:09.753 --> 27:11.504
but I will never let you go.

27:13.757 --> 27:16.051
No matter how much
you pine for each other,

27:16.134 --> 27:18.511
it's nothing but a filthy affair
that no one recognizes.

27:20.013 --> 27:21.348
That's all.

27:24.851 --> 27:25.727
I know.

27:29.356 --> 27:30.440
You do?

27:42.118 --> 27:43.787
What are you doing?

27:43.870 --> 27:47.040
What do you think?
I'm getting rid of it for you.

27:47.999 --> 27:49.125
Hae-won.

27:50.460 --> 27:52.462
Don't yearn for something that's ruined.

27:53.463 --> 27:56.049
If your life is ruined,
you just have to endure it.

27:56.591 --> 27:58.301
But you can always make these things.

27:58.385 --> 27:59.260
So?

28:00.720 --> 28:03.390
I'm the one who ruined your life,

28:05.725 --> 28:07.685
yet you want to keep me by your side?

28:09.854 --> 28:11.481
What do you want me to do?

28:12.273 --> 28:13.483
Can't you just tell me?

28:17.821 --> 28:19.280
I'm suffocating.

28:22.659 --> 28:23.993
Are you?

28:25.787 --> 28:27.539
It's only been a few months.

28:31.626 --> 28:33.211
It was years for me.

28:36.381 --> 28:38.216
You left without saying anything.

28:38.299 --> 28:41.052
I resented you,
blamed myself, and felt afraid…

28:42.720 --> 28:44.013
for years.

28:46.266 --> 28:48.226
What more do you want to know?

28:48.309 --> 28:50.228
You vanished into thin air.

28:51.396 --> 28:52.939
That's all that I know.

28:53.022 --> 28:56.526
You smiled and waved goodbye as if
we'd meet the next day, then you vanished.

28:58.445 --> 29:00.447
I had to piece together the rest.

29:01.906 --> 29:04.075
So have the decency
to put the last piece in.

29:11.499 --> 29:13.668
You're the one who made me like this.

29:15.962 --> 29:18.423
Do you know what I lost then?

29:18.506 --> 29:21.551
No. Do you know what we lost?

29:22.343 --> 29:25.221
We lost something precious
that we'll never get back!

29:27.640 --> 29:28.516
Do you know that?

30:20.693 --> 30:23.112
SLIGO, IRELAND

31:01.109 --> 31:03.444
<i>I heard you're back in Ireland.</i>

31:03.528 --> 31:05.029
<i>I'll wait for you.</i>

32:03.212 --> 32:05.590
-Did you change the passcode?
-My God.

32:06.841 --> 32:07.675
Yes.

32:27.195 --> 32:29.405
Why aren't you staying at your house?

32:30.490 --> 32:33.785
I took out the security deposit
and invested it somewhere.

32:35.745 --> 32:38.456
Again? What are you wasting it
on this time?

32:38.539 --> 32:40.625
Why are you jinxing it?

32:42.126 --> 32:44.504
The lease on this house
won't be up anytime soon,

32:44.587 --> 32:46.631
and you moved out to live with him.

32:46.714 --> 32:48.091
Why keep it vacant?

32:50.593 --> 32:53.179
Why are you here anyway?
Did you have a fight?

33:01.104 --> 33:02.271
My God.

33:03.064 --> 33:05.608
You have the skin of a mom
who's been busy childrearing.

33:05.692 --> 33:09.028
Scratch that. Even moms
take great care of their skin these days.

33:09.654 --> 33:11.489
You're unbelievable.

33:11.572 --> 33:12.573
It's all genetics.

33:13.491 --> 33:15.410
Don't be ridiculous. Look at me.

33:15.493 --> 33:17.286
It's just poor care.

33:17.370 --> 33:20.206
Maybe I take after my dad
whom I've never met before.

33:21.040 --> 33:23.418
This is some top-notch skincare.

33:23.501 --> 33:25.253
Do you know how much this thing costs?

33:26.087 --> 33:29.007
You still look so young.

33:29.090 --> 33:32.510
Of course. I put a lot
of time and effort into my skin.

33:36.180 --> 33:39.100
How did you think
of having me at such a young age?

33:39.183 --> 33:40.727
I wasn't thinking, obviously.

33:40.810 --> 33:42.395
Because I was clueless back then.

33:45.648 --> 33:48.192
I can still feel the pain of giving birth.

33:48.276 --> 33:50.194
I also suffered from inflammation.

33:51.988 --> 33:53.197
Why bother explaining?

33:54.032 --> 33:56.367
It's not like you'd understand.

33:57.660 --> 34:00.246
I refuse to repeat it ever again.

34:00.329 --> 34:03.124
I couldn't graduate high school
thanks to you.

34:05.835 --> 34:09.547
I admire you
for giving up so much all for me.

34:10.923 --> 34:12.467
And I'm sorry.

34:13.342 --> 34:15.053
You were still lovely.

34:15.136 --> 34:17.722
Even amidst all the chaos,
you were so lovable.

34:20.641 --> 34:22.351
Come to think of it,

34:22.435 --> 34:25.855
there's another good thing
I did for your grandpa.

34:28.149 --> 34:30.109
The first one was giving birth to you.

34:30.193 --> 34:31.527
And the second one

34:32.403 --> 34:34.030
is outliving him.

34:35.448 --> 34:38.076
When your grandma and uncle died,

34:39.786 --> 34:43.081
I'd never heard your grandpa
bawl and cry like that before.

34:44.123 --> 34:49.295
That's when I promised myself
that I'd outlive him at all costs.

34:51.380 --> 34:54.884
So you just do those two things too.

34:55.468 --> 34:58.137
Have a baby who's better off than you
and outlive me.

36:07.790 --> 36:09.041
Sorry, Mom.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.462
I don't think I can do either of them.

36:32.565 --> 36:34.358
<i>Due to your bad credit,</i>

36:34.442 --> 36:37.445
<i>your compensation
will be seized immediately.</i>

36:37.528 --> 36:40.990
<i>As soon as you're released,
open a bank account under Ju-yeong's name.</i>

36:44.785 --> 36:47.288
It's about "the type."

36:47.371 --> 36:50.583
The type of person you are.

36:51.083 --> 36:55.087
And this is also called
your moral self-image.

36:55.171 --> 36:58.090
We'll talk about that next time.
That'll be all.

36:58.174 --> 37:00.301
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

37:00.384 --> 37:02.386
LEE JU-YEONG

37:11.479 --> 37:13.064
What did you do last night?

37:17.151 --> 37:20.238
Hey, Ju-yeong. Aren't you going to eat?

37:25.409 --> 37:28.412
Today's school lunch was disgusting.
I'm so lucky.

37:32.166 --> 37:34.293
I'm sorry for not being in touch lately.

37:34.377 --> 37:35.670
It's okay.

37:36.462 --> 37:38.589
I heard your grandfather passed away.

37:42.051 --> 37:43.636
Did you get the text?

37:43.719 --> 37:46.180
Your dad was discharged today.
He'll be home.

37:49.225 --> 37:52.186
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

37:56.524 --> 37:58.484
Is everything fine with you and Li-sa?

38:00.569 --> 38:04.323
She goes to the dance studio
in the afternoon, so we barely meet.

38:04.907 --> 38:06.575
I heard she was at my wedding.

38:07.243 --> 38:08.369
Did you bring her?

38:09.954 --> 38:12.415
Ms. Gu, she's a bit strange.

38:13.416 --> 38:17.670
She took my phone and looked
at the video I took of you that day.

38:17.753 --> 38:20.798
Then she cried and threw a fit.

38:36.439 --> 38:38.649
<i>Thanks for coming to my wedding, Li-sa.</i>

38:38.733 --> 38:40.860
Damn it, Ju-yeong.

38:44.280 --> 38:45.990
MIMI

38:49.952 --> 38:53.039
<i>You should've said hi.
Why did you just leave?</i>

38:55.750 --> 38:59.253
<i>Why did you marry him
when he had feelings for another woman?</i>

39:01.464 --> 39:03.382
<i>It's easy to fall in love,</i>

39:03.466 --> 39:06.010
<i>but breaking up is complicated.</i>

39:11.932 --> 39:13.601
<i>Did you see who that woman was?</i>

39:20.983 --> 39:22.151
<i>I did.</i>

39:25.488 --> 39:26.655
<i>Through a painting.</i>

39:29.992 --> 39:30.951
<i>A painting?</i>

39:32.787 --> 39:34.622
<i>He drew a painting of her.</i>

39:34.705 --> 39:37.958
<i>I could feel his emotions
through his paintings.</i>

39:53.933 --> 39:55.142
TAERIM HOSPITAL

39:55.226 --> 39:56.894
<i>Raise your arm slowly.</i>

39:56.977 --> 39:59.230
Let me know if you feel pain.

39:59.313 --> 40:00.314
Okay.

40:03.484 --> 40:05.361
You should cut down on work.

40:05.945 --> 40:07.822
You injured the same area.

40:07.905 --> 40:09.907
It's best to let it rest.

40:11.450 --> 40:14.537
Since you got an injection,
I'll just do heat treatment today.

40:14.620 --> 40:15.579
Okay.

40:17.331 --> 40:20.084
By the way, how is Hae-won doing?

40:23.295 --> 40:26.465
You should bring her with you
next time even if she says no.

40:27.091 --> 40:28.884
I heard she took up

40:28.968 --> 40:31.762
a lot of outsourcing work
at her previous design job.

40:32.888 --> 40:35.182
I believe that's when
her rheumatism manifested.

40:35.808 --> 40:39.395
And judging by her medication,
she must also have fibromyalgia.

40:39.979 --> 40:41.939
That's the worst, you see.

40:42.022 --> 40:44.567
You feel pain all over your body.

40:46.193 --> 40:49.822
I bet she has to rely
on painkillers to sleep at night.

40:52.283 --> 40:56.120
I didn't know
since I always fell asleep first.

40:58.372 --> 41:00.040
<i>If you take benzodiazepine</i>

41:00.124 --> 41:03.711
with steroids, it's worse for your health.

41:04.295 --> 41:05.671
I give that to Woo-jae.

41:07.339 --> 41:10.259
<i>I'm nervous that
Woo-jae might run away while I'm asleep.</i>

41:13.512 --> 41:15.389
I'm sorry.

41:16.140 --> 41:18.184
It's a force of habit.

41:18.267 --> 41:19.977
I didn't mean to be nosy.

41:20.060 --> 41:22.605
It's okay. I'm rather relieved.

41:23.355 --> 41:26.525
At least someone knows about her pain.

41:37.244 --> 41:38.913
Take care.

41:45.294 --> 41:46.212
Seon-u.

41:52.593 --> 41:54.428
-Hello.
-Hey.

41:54.512 --> 41:57.473
It's starting this week,
so make sure you come.

42:02.686 --> 42:04.063
Give it your all.

42:04.146 --> 42:06.023
Strive to be a better person.

42:06.106 --> 42:09.109
VOLUNTEER RECRUITMENT
TO HELP SUPPORT EX-CONVICTS

42:19.161 --> 42:20.454
For how much longer?

42:25.125 --> 42:27.419
There's no end to that.

42:28.420 --> 42:31.215
Have you ever seen
a bad guy striving to be badder?

42:31.298 --> 42:33.259
They don't need to try.

42:34.176 --> 42:36.053
It's a part of their nature.

42:37.429 --> 42:41.850
So you should do your utmost
to become a better person

42:42.434 --> 42:44.228
until your very last breath.

42:51.694 --> 42:52.611
Let's go eat.

43:21.640 --> 43:22.641
Darn it.

43:32.401 --> 43:33.569
Li-sa.

43:34.528 --> 43:36.030
What are you doing here?

43:38.991 --> 43:39.992
What is this?

43:42.202 --> 43:43.495
This?

43:44.079 --> 43:47.291
After what you said last time,
I looked for the photo and found it.

43:48.500 --> 43:51.170
See? We were there with your dad.

43:54.131 --> 43:56.300
-Are you going to paint it?
-What?

43:58.093 --> 43:59.720
Are you going to paint that too?

44:01.722 --> 44:04.475
I do want to
since you were adorable back then.

44:04.558 --> 44:05.517
Do it.

44:08.228 --> 44:10.648
What's with you?
You hate it when I draw you.

44:11.231 --> 44:12.274
I just

44:13.233 --> 44:15.903
want to see the emotions you feel
when you paint it.

44:40.761 --> 44:42.179
You see, vodka…

44:45.057 --> 44:46.600
is a fascinating drink

44:47.810 --> 44:50.312
Unlike other drinks that try to stand out,

44:50.813 --> 44:53.565
this has no color, taste, or smell.

44:53.649 --> 44:55.109
Less is more with this one.

44:57.069 --> 45:00.197
It doesn't matter what this is made from

45:01.198 --> 45:03.200
because all tastes and scents
are gone in the end.

45:03.992 --> 45:07.413
But it mixes well with any drink

45:09.456 --> 45:11.708
and tastes different
depending on what you add.

45:14.837 --> 45:15.712
Try it.

45:38.318 --> 45:40.446
Your grandfather gave me some last time.

45:51.915 --> 45:53.292
Doesn't it taste smoother?

46:01.049 --> 46:02.342
My wife…

46:03.927 --> 46:07.890
spent all my retirement pay, savings,
and money from our home equity loan

46:09.725 --> 46:12.060
on a patch of land without telling me.

46:17.149 --> 46:18.650
She was scammed.

46:20.903 --> 46:24.031
After keeping it from me
for a while, she fell ill.

46:25.491 --> 46:26.783
It was cancer.

46:28.619 --> 46:30.370
There was nothing we could do.

46:31.038 --> 46:32.164
However,

46:34.374 --> 46:37.294
I was too busy chasing
after those frauds to mourn for her.

46:41.590 --> 46:43.342
Did you eventually catch them?

46:47.513 --> 46:49.598
It was also her fault
for purchasing the land,

46:50.766 --> 46:53.810
so they got away with it
without getting punished.

46:57.814 --> 46:59.483
You must've been upset.

47:00.275 --> 47:01.485
I was.

47:03.779 --> 47:05.948
I wasted so much time chasing after them

47:06.031 --> 47:07.658
and reaped nothing in return.

47:07.741 --> 47:09.326
I felt guilty and was in pain.

47:11.203 --> 47:13.539
I erased everything,
even the good memories I had.

47:17.918 --> 47:19.002
Don't be like me.

47:22.422 --> 47:24.758
Mourn as much as you need to
while you can.

47:26.051 --> 47:28.178
And cherish the good memories.

47:28.971 --> 47:29.930
Okay?

47:56.373 --> 47:57.207
What?

47:58.792 --> 48:00.127
How did you find me?

48:04.548 --> 48:07.676
FAVORITES
HAE-WON

48:10.012 --> 48:10.971
That?

48:11.054 --> 48:12.806
Do you not trust me?

48:16.435 --> 48:17.394
No.

48:20.981 --> 48:22.608
It must've tormented you.

48:25.402 --> 48:26.987
What is this?

48:27.070 --> 48:30.198
Like you said, I ruined your life.

48:31.158 --> 48:32.451
So you're holding me down.

48:34.202 --> 48:36.622
I'm thinking of what I should do

48:37.706 --> 48:38.749
to make up for it.

48:44.796 --> 48:45.881
Let's go home.

49:00.020 --> 49:02.022
RICE & BAR

49:12.658 --> 49:14.409
-Here's your key.
-Thank you.

49:18.747 --> 49:21.291
Can you feed him lunch
as soon as you get there?

49:21.375 --> 49:22.501
-Okay.
-Let's go.

49:35.430 --> 49:38.183
Why are you up already?
Get some more sleep.

49:40.435 --> 49:41.603
What's all that?

49:41.687 --> 49:44.940
I'm behind on my work
so I'll stay at the studio for a while.

49:47.442 --> 49:49.736
I've frozen some curry.

49:49.820 --> 49:51.863
Microwave it with some rice.

49:51.947 --> 49:54.157
Why don't you just beg me for a divorce?

49:57.244 --> 49:59.788
Don't you think it's cowardly
to pretend to care for me

50:00.789 --> 50:02.124
as you leave home?

50:03.625 --> 50:06.461
<i>Because you already
abandoned Hae-won once before.</i>

50:07.045 --> 50:10.799
<i>If you turn away from her again,
Hae-won will die.</i>

50:16.179 --> 50:19.891
I'm not leaving for good.
It's only temporary.

50:21.435 --> 50:22.894
I want to do well.

50:26.648 --> 50:28.233
And I didn't delete the app.

50:28.775 --> 50:31.319
Feel free to check my location
whenever you want.

50:33.572 --> 50:34.656
I'll get going.

50:51.840 --> 50:54.342
Here. Have one bite. Please?

50:55.093 --> 50:56.470
Don't you like <i>tonkatsu</i>?

50:58.013 --> 51:00.474
I'll go order something else. Hold on.

51:20.202 --> 51:22.412
Hi. We've met before, right?

51:25.290 --> 51:27.125
What's wrong? Is it not tasty?

51:35.801 --> 51:36.718
It's good.

51:39.471 --> 51:42.349
<i>Tonkatsu</i> is made with pork.

51:42.432 --> 51:43.600
Oink-oink, pig.

51:44.476 --> 51:47.938
Pigs become as big as me
even when they're just a year old.

51:48.021 --> 51:50.190
Then they get killed for meat like this.

51:54.694 --> 51:55.779
Don't you feel bad?

51:58.740 --> 52:01.201
Then we should at least savor it.

52:01.827 --> 52:02.661
Here. Eat.

52:10.293 --> 52:13.630
Are you also here for my birthday party?

52:13.713 --> 52:14.673
Oh, my.

52:16.216 --> 52:18.760
Your birthday party? When's your birthday?

52:19.344 --> 52:20.345
This Friday.

52:21.721 --> 52:23.139
What a great day.

52:23.932 --> 52:26.268
I don't think I was invited yet.

52:26.351 --> 52:27.644
Will you invite me?

52:29.938 --> 52:31.231
Thanks.

52:31.314 --> 52:34.067
When's your birthday?

52:35.569 --> 52:38.905
I'm not sure.
I haven't celebrated it in ages.

52:40.532 --> 52:42.993
What were birthdays for…

52:43.076 --> 52:44.578
Don't you know?

52:45.537 --> 52:47.539
It's the day you blow out candles.

52:48.623 --> 52:51.126
Right. I see.

52:53.336 --> 52:54.963
How many candles will you blow out?

52:56.256 --> 52:59.801
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

53:00.594 --> 53:01.887
Seven candles.

53:03.763 --> 53:05.223
You'll be turning seven?

53:17.319 --> 53:19.988
Do you seriously need
party favors for his birthday party?

53:20.780 --> 53:22.324
That's how it is apparently.

53:23.074 --> 53:26.328
Back when we were little,
all our neighbors were poor.

53:26.411 --> 53:29.247
Birthday parties were a privilege.

53:29.331 --> 53:30.749
But Ho-su is different.

53:31.708 --> 53:32.751
That's true.

53:39.049 --> 53:40.967
Hui-ju, do you remember?

53:41.051 --> 53:42.469
What?

53:42.552 --> 53:44.054
I think I was around Ho-su's age.

53:44.554 --> 53:48.475
Do you remember
that 500-won toy in front of our school?

53:49.517 --> 53:52.979
I came home crying about how
the store owner accused me of stealing it.

53:53.063 --> 53:56.733
You bathed me, dressed me
in my best clothes, and went back.

53:57.651 --> 53:59.945
"Seon-u doesn't steal things."

54:00.528 --> 54:01.529
Did I do that?

54:03.198 --> 54:06.701
And you told me to pick anything
I wanted to buy in that store.

54:06.785 --> 54:09.120
I did, having no idea
that was your lunch money.

54:09.704 --> 54:10.956
That's what you did.

54:11.665 --> 54:14.084
By the way, why didn't you ask me?

54:14.709 --> 54:16.294
Whether I stole it or not.

54:16.378 --> 54:18.964
What for?
I knew you didn't have any money.

54:20.048 --> 54:21.675
Despite knowing everything,

54:22.425 --> 54:24.594
you defended me
and sacrificed your lunch money?

54:27.180 --> 54:31.226
When there's something you want badly
enough, people will even steal for it.

54:33.687 --> 54:35.063
That day,

54:35.855 --> 54:38.900
I promised myself to always listen to you
and treat you well.

54:39.526 --> 54:41.861
Then you can babysit Ho-su this afternoon.

54:42.529 --> 54:45.657
His babysitter needs to go
grocery shopping for his birthday party.

54:45.740 --> 54:47.450
Gosh, you took that favor real quick.

54:49.035 --> 54:51.538
Sure. What about you?

54:52.622 --> 54:53.748
I have to work.

54:56.001 --> 54:58.461
I'm too stuck.

54:58.545 --> 55:00.922
I'll just let Ho-su pick the one he likes.

55:01.881 --> 55:03.425
-Mom!
-Ho-su, come here.

55:04.259 --> 55:07.095
Ho-su, which one do you like?

55:10.432 --> 55:11.391
This one?

55:19.899 --> 55:23.403
TOP TEN BILLIARD HALL

55:23.486 --> 55:25.321
WE OPPOSE THE SCHOOL OF ARTS!

55:34.372 --> 55:35.498
Gosh.

55:43.006 --> 55:44.215
Ju-yeong, bring me water.

55:44.716 --> 55:46.259
Ju-yeong!

55:50.847 --> 55:52.849
Who the hell is that?

55:52.932 --> 55:55.643
-Hey. Who the hell are you?
-Hey!

55:56.352 --> 55:57.896
-Damn it.
-Hey, let me go.

55:57.979 --> 55:59.147
Stop it!

55:59.230 --> 56:01.399
Don't touch that!

56:25.965 --> 56:28.468
Some of the kids are allergic to seafood.

56:28.551 --> 56:30.678
Yes, vegan.

56:30.762 --> 56:32.722
Ji-ho's mom is a vegan.

56:32.806 --> 56:35.183
Please take note of that.

56:35.266 --> 56:36.392
Thank you.

56:39.354 --> 56:41.481
I think we're pretty much ready.

56:42.440 --> 56:44.734
Is there anything else I should do?

56:44.818 --> 56:47.737
You're a quick study. Not bad.

56:48.738 --> 56:51.324
You've formed your own taste.

56:52.867 --> 56:55.245
It's all thanks to you.

56:55.328 --> 56:57.288
Why do you think I'm tolerant of you?

56:59.374 --> 57:01.835
You don't use your kids to your advantage.

57:01.918 --> 57:04.170
You know your place.

57:04.796 --> 57:07.799
You're not as vulgar as your parents.

57:08.341 --> 57:11.010
Rather, you're eager to learn.

57:11.886 --> 57:13.263
That's why.

57:13.346 --> 57:15.348
It's not because you're good at anything.

57:16.641 --> 57:17.934
Remember this.

57:18.017 --> 57:21.146
You better not do anything
I don't like in the future as well.

57:26.359 --> 57:27.193
Where's Ho-su?

57:27.861 --> 57:30.071
His dad will leave work early

57:30.155 --> 57:32.407
and pick him up from kindergarten.

57:32.991 --> 57:34.909
The party will be held at my place.

57:34.993 --> 57:36.619
I thought we'd have it here--

57:36.703 --> 57:39.497
How will you fit
so many people in this tiny house?

57:39.581 --> 57:41.583
You don't know anything.

57:45.587 --> 57:47.589
SECURITY

57:53.261 --> 57:55.180
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, HO-SU

58:02.812 --> 58:05.732
Hi. Thank you for coming.

58:05.815 --> 58:06.858
I hope he likes it.

58:06.941 --> 58:09.903
You didn't have to bring anything.

58:09.986 --> 58:11.696
You must've been busy preparing.

58:11.779 --> 58:13.364
-I ordered them.
-Did you?

58:13.448 --> 58:16.159
-From where?
-I'll tell you later.

58:46.105 --> 58:48.149
SECURITY

58:48.233 --> 58:49.817
It's Dracula!

58:49.901 --> 58:50.985
Ho-su, wait.

58:52.195 --> 58:53.446
Hello, Mr. An.

58:53.947 --> 58:56.282
Yes, we just arrived.

58:57.075 --> 58:58.743
Yes, his birthday party.

58:58.826 --> 59:01.663
I think someone's here to pick him up.

59:01.746 --> 59:02.997
One minute.

59:03.581 --> 59:04.415
Ho-su!

59:10.255 --> 59:11.798
Let's go inside.

59:11.881 --> 59:14.592
One by one. Slowly. Don't rush.

59:49.627 --> 59:50.461
Where's Ho-su?

59:51.379 --> 59:52.589
I heard he was here.

59:53.381 --> 59:56.718
What are you talking about?
You were supposed to pick him up.

59:56.801 --> 59:59.470
I was late, so I called.
She said someone picked him up.

1:00:04.517 --> 1:00:05.351
Hui-ju.

1:00:06.644 --> 1:00:07.687
Ho-su.

1:00:09.606 --> 1:00:10.440
Ho-su?

1:00:12.191 --> 1:00:13.276
Ho-su.

1:00:15.737 --> 1:00:16.654
Ho-su.

1:00:18.197 --> 1:00:19.073
Ho-su.

1:00:30.960 --> 1:00:32.170
Ho-su…

1:00:39.886 --> 1:00:40.845
Ho-su.

1:00:48.394 --> 1:00:51.105
Ho-su!

1:00:52.857 --> 1:00:54.275
Ho-su!

1:00:56.569 --> 1:00:58.071
Ho-su!

1:00:59.864 --> 1:01:02.742
Ho-su!

1:01:04.661 --> 1:01:08.122
Ho-su!

1:01:12.669 --> 1:01:15.713
<i>Hi, Hui-ju. About Ho-su's birthday party,</i>

1:01:16.422 --> 1:01:20.176
<i>I was invited but I can't make it.
So I'd like to send him a gift.</i>

1:01:22.428 --> 1:01:23.846
Where is Ho-su?

1:01:26.683 --> 1:01:29.394
Hae-won, where is he?

1:01:31.187 --> 1:01:32.105
<i>Hui-ju.</i>

1:01:32.814 --> 1:01:35.608
Fine. I was wrong.

1:01:35.692 --> 1:01:38.277
Let's say I committed a grave sin.

1:01:38.361 --> 1:01:40.947
But that still doesn't give you

1:01:41.948 --> 1:01:45.284
the right to touch my kid!

1:01:48.204 --> 1:01:50.498
<i>It shouldn't be, "Let's say".</i>

1:01:51.249 --> 1:01:53.000
<i>Get that straight.</i>

1:01:55.670 --> 1:01:59.549
Okay, I was wrong.
I'm to blame for everything.

1:01:59.632 --> 1:02:02.593
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Hae-won.

1:02:04.053 --> 1:02:07.348
I'm truly sorry, so please bring back--

1:02:07.432 --> 1:02:09.183
<i>Don't be sorry, Hui-ju.</i>

1:02:12.478 --> 1:02:13.896
I told you already.

1:02:14.772 --> 1:02:17.859
You don't have the right
to apologize anymore.

1:02:18.735 --> 1:02:21.320
<i>And even more so
if you're forcing yourself.</i>

1:02:22.113 --> 1:02:23.656
<i>That's offensive.</i>

1:02:28.327 --> 1:02:29.162
Hae-won.

1:02:30.288 --> 1:02:32.123
-Yes?
<i>-Where are you?</i>

1:02:35.376 --> 1:02:36.669
Answer me.

1:02:36.753 --> 1:02:40.089
Come here right now. Give me my son back!

1:02:40.882 --> 1:02:43.509
If you don't, I'm going to kill you.

1:02:43.593 --> 1:02:45.845
I'll rip you to shreds!

1:02:46.763 --> 1:02:49.557
Gu Hae-won! Where are you?

1:02:49.640 --> 1:02:51.517
Give me my son back!

1:02:52.018 --> 1:02:53.978
I'll kill you!

1:02:54.061 --> 1:02:56.522
-Ho-su!
-What's the matter, Hui-ju?

1:02:58.065 --> 1:03:00.318
<i>Why didn't you pick him up?</i>

1:03:01.444 --> 1:03:03.321
<i>You should've picked him up</i>

1:03:03.404 --> 1:03:05.573
<i>as you were supposed to!</i>

1:03:46.989 --> 1:03:50.493
I'm so sorry to Ho-su!
Do something! Find Ho-su!

1:03:50.576 --> 1:03:52.620
<i>I'm going to find Ho-su.</i>

1:03:52.703 --> 1:03:55.998
I told you I'd kill you
if you touched my child.

1:03:56.082 --> 1:03:58.167
What? My house isn't this way.

1:03:58.751 --> 1:04:00.211
<i>Hae-won made him do it.</i>

1:04:00.294 --> 1:04:01.587
You knew, didn't you?

1:04:01.671 --> 1:04:05.258
<i>I only need to watch
your life getting ruined.</i>

1:04:05.341 --> 1:04:06.759
<i>Your husband knows.</i>

1:04:07.718 --> 1:04:10.429
You dare ask me again…

1:04:10.513 --> 1:04:12.181
Where's Ho-su?

1:04:13.057 --> 1:04:15.142
<i>It seems you also have many secrets.</i>

1:04:15.226 --> 1:04:16.561
Even if it's a lie!

1:04:16.644 --> 1:04:18.229
<i>Just say something.</i>

1:04:18.771 --> 1:04:20.106
I guess I was right.

1:04:20.731 --> 1:04:22.775
<i>In the end, my story…</i>

1:04:24.986 --> 1:04:27.029
<i>won't have a happy ending.</i>

1:04:28.614 --> 1:04:33.619
