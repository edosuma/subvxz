00:09.040 --> 00:11.152
Archer to the bridge...

00:15.000 --> 00:15.787
I'm sorry, sir.

00:15.787 --> 00:18.257
I've orders to keep you here.

00:18.257 --> 00:20.062
Orders?

00:20.062 --> 00:21.432
From who?

00:21.432 --> 00:23.681
The Captain.

00:27.791 --> 00:29.355
We're losing forward hull plating!

00:29.355 --> 00:31.942
Target their engines !

00:31.942 --> 00:33.999
No effect!

00:35.592 --> 00:36.991
What the hell's going on?

00:36.991 --> 00:40.520
Someone take him back to his quarters!

00:40.520 --> 00:42.484
Weapons are off-line!

00:42.484 --> 00:44.465
Captain...!

01:28.568 --> 01:32.072
Song: "Faith of the Heart"
It's been a long road,

01:32.567 --> 01:35.763
Getting from there to here,

01:35.858 --> 01:38.749
It's been a long time,

01:39.658 --> 01:43.518
But my time is finally near,

01:43.592 --> 01:47.772
And I will see my dream come alive at last,

01:47.867 --> 01:51.245
I will touch the sky

01:51.411 --> 01:54.948
And they're not gonna hold me down no more,

01:55.305 --> 01:58.356
No they're not gonna change my mind,

01:58.451 --> 02:03.087
Cause I've got faith of the heart,

02:03.241 --> 02:05.667
I'm going where my heart will take me,

02:06.269 --> 02:10.857
I've got faith to believe,

02:10.973 --> 02:13.711
I can do anything,

02:13.894 --> 02:18.484
I've got strength of the soul,

02:18.579 --> 02:21.417
But no one gonna bend or break me,

02:21.498 --> 02:26.977
I can reach any star,

02:27.067 --> 02:30.816
I've got faith, I've got

02:31.305 --> 02:39.666
I've got faith, faith of the heart.

02:57.807 --> 03:00.007
060 [3x08] Twilight

03:45.419 --> 03:47.094
Hello?

03:48.319 --> 03:51.093
You're up early.

03:52.250 --> 03:54.796
T'Pol?

03:54.796 --> 03:57.422
I know this all seems unfamiliar.

03:57.422 --> 03:59.683
I promise I'll explain everything.

03:59.683 --> 04:02.950
Why don't you sit down?
Breakfast is almost ready.

04:02.950 --> 04:05.826
Where are we?

04:05.826 --> 04:07.941
Jonathan, please, sit down.

04:07.941 --> 04:10.517
I'll answer all of your questions.

04:11.933 --> 04:16.226
Today is a very important day.

04:17.464 --> 04:20.317
I have a great deal to tell you.

04:26.540 --> 04:30.695
What's the last thing you remember?

04:30.695 --> 04:34.516
I was in the Command Center looking at long-range scans.

04:34.516 --> 04:40.868
Do you remember what happened after you left the Command Center?

04:42.236 --> 04:47.746
We were in a corridor... you and I, on our way to the bridge.

04:47.746 --> 04:54.136
This will be difficult for you to accept but that was 12 years ago.

04:54.136 --> 04:56.110
You coming tonight?

04:56.110 --> 04:57.965
I hadn't planned on it.

04:57.965 --> 05:01.851
I can make Movie Night mandatory for senior officers.

05:01.851 --> 05:02.766
You'll enjoy it.

05:02.766 --> 05:06.801
Rosemary's Baby. It'll scare the hell out of you.

05:09.044 --> 05:11.797
Archer to the bridge... report.

05:11.797 --> 05:13.913
There's a power surge in the starboard nacelle.

05:13.913 --> 05:15.748
It seems to have been caused by an anomaly.

05:15.748 --> 05:17.902
Take us out of warp.

05:19.246 --> 05:21.956
The helm's not responding.

05:21.956 --> 05:24.376
The starboard injectors are fused.

05:24.376 --> 05:26.616
I'm reading more anomalies ahead.

05:26.616 --> 05:30.054
Alter course... 20 degrees to port.

06:06.239 --> 06:07.430
You have to get out of here!

06:07.430 --> 06:09.824
I'm not leaving you!

06:38.858 --> 06:41.971
How do you feel?

06:41.971 --> 06:47.260
Like a shuttlepod landed on my head.

06:47.260 --> 06:50.398
- Was anyone else hurt?
- No.

06:50.398 --> 06:52.862
Captain, there are a few questions I have to ask you.

06:52.862 --> 06:54.717
Well, it'll have to wait.

06:54.717 --> 06:56.629
I want to get to the bridge.

06:56.629 --> 07:00.117
I'm afraid I have to insist.

07:00.117 --> 07:03.826
When did you last speak to Commander Tucker?

07:03.826 --> 07:07.264
This morning at the staff briefing.

07:07.264 --> 07:10.444
Why?

07:13.094 --> 07:15.388
What's going on, Phlox?

07:15.388 --> 07:18.698
The anomaly in the corridor left something behind.

07:18.698 --> 07:20.910
We've never seen it before.

07:22.706 --> 07:25.830
This is a micro-cellular scan of your hippocampus.

07:25.830 --> 07:29.722
You've been infected by several clusters of parasites.

07:29.722 --> 07:30.966
They haven't caused any tissue damage,

07:30.966 --> 07:33.820
but they're impairing certain synaptic functions.

07:33.820 --> 07:39.058
They're preventing you from forming new long-term memories.

07:39.058 --> 07:40.134
Long-term?

07:40.134 --> 07:42.698
You can recall events that happened before the infection,

07:42.698 --> 07:45.548
but everything after fades within a few hours.

07:45.548 --> 07:48.750
Captain, you've been in Sick Bay for the past three days.

07:48.750 --> 07:51.252
You last spoke to Commander Tucker about seven hours ago.

07:51.252 --> 07:54.578
He came to see you, right here.

08:02.279 --> 08:04.387
You can't remove these parasites?

08:04.387 --> 08:07.423
So far, they haven't responded to any traditional therapies.

08:07.423 --> 08:11.889
But I'm synthesizing an antigen that shows some promise.

08:11.889 --> 08:17.583
You can be assured I won't stop working on this until I find a cure.

08:17.583 --> 08:21.107
The Doctor continued to search for a remedy over the next several weeks.

08:21.107 --> 08:24.255
Commander Tucker and I did our best to keep you updated each day

08:24.255 --> 08:25.684
on the progress of our mission.

08:25.684 --> 08:27.912
It looked like we had a lead on that Xindi ship--

08:27.912 --> 08:30.229
the one we planted the tracking device on--

08:30.229 --> 08:33.457
but it turned out to be a garbage scow.

08:33.457 --> 08:38.539
They were carrying a shipment with the same radiolytic signature.

08:40.232 --> 08:42.029
I had an idea this morning...

08:42.029 --> 08:43.866
after you told me what happened.

08:43.866 --> 08:48.883
I came up with a way to upgrade the antimatter inducers.

08:48.883 --> 08:53.661
We can travel farther on less fuel.

08:57.884 --> 09:01.342
Let me guess-- I already gave you these specs.

09:01.342 --> 09:03.663
A week ago.

09:03.663 --> 09:07.078
But your upgrades are working nicely.

09:10.735 --> 09:13.948
Well, I should get back to Engineering.

09:13.948 --> 09:16.002
Uh, see you both later.

09:19.792 --> 09:22.920
I imagine that must happen often.

09:22.920 --> 09:25.504
Maybe these "daily briefings" aren't such a good idea.

09:25.504 --> 09:29.772
It looks like it's just a waste of your time... and Trip's.

09:29.772 --> 09:31.604
I disagree.

09:31.604 --> 09:34.182
We both rely on your experience.

09:34.182 --> 09:40.034
You can still contribute to the success of this mission.

09:40.034 --> 09:44.015
I'm sure you have work to do.

09:44.015 --> 09:46.094
I'll be in my quarters.

09:46.094 --> 09:49.976
In the corridor... when the anomaly hit,

09:49.976 --> 09:53.399
I urged you to leave me behind.

09:53.399 --> 09:59.965
If you had, it's likely I'd be the one suffering from this condition.

09:59.965 --> 10:02.978
Fortunately, I don't take orders from you.

10:02.978 --> 10:11.313
Captain... I never expressed my gratitude for what you did.

10:11.313 --> 10:16.388
I suppose there's not much point in thanking me.

10:16.388 --> 10:19.105
A few hours from now, I won't remember it.

10:27.280 --> 10:30.006
Bridge to T'Pol.

10:32.909 --> 10:34.051
Go ahead.

10:34.051 --> 10:36.389
We're receiving a hail through the subspace buoy.

10:36.389 --> 10:37.788
It's Starfleet.

10:37.788 --> 10:39.409
I'm on my way.

10:40.741 --> 10:43.996
This was not a conversation I was looking forward to.

10:43.996 --> 10:46.121
It was Admiral Forrest.

10:46.121 --> 10:50.840
The Command Council had reviewed the doctor's report on your condition.

10:50.840 --> 10:55.323
They relieved you of duty and granted me a field commission.

10:58.389 --> 11:00.559
Forrest made you Captain.

11:00.559 --> 11:05.630
I suppose congratulations are in order... even if they are belated.

11:05.630 --> 11:12.942
I guess... these parasites weren't so easy to remove after all.

11:12.942 --> 11:19.318
Phlox discovered that the organisms are from a domain outside normal space-time.

11:19.318 --> 11:22.567
They exist in a state of interspatial flux.

11:22.567 --> 11:27.138
None of his treatments had any effect on them.

11:29.094 --> 11:31.591
What about the mission?

11:31.591 --> 11:35.083
Did you find the Xindi weapon?

11:35.623 --> 11:41.527
After several months of searching, we learned where the weapon was being constructed.

11:41.527 --> 11:43.701
But the Xindi knew we were getting close.

11:43.701 --> 11:46.527
They dispatched two vessels to intercept us.

11:53.934 --> 11:55.637
That last one took out warp engines!

11:55.637 --> 11:58.805
They're locking on to the starboard docking port!

11:58.805 --> 12:01.118
Send security teams.

12:47.507 --> 12:50.631
I'm reading 23 intruders on Decks C, D and E.

12:50.631 --> 12:54.080
Have your men set up a defense perimeter on B-Deck.

13:12.653 --> 13:14.888
We've lost weapons!

13:16.412 --> 13:18.499
Is their ship still docked with us?

13:18.499 --> 13:20.537
It is.

13:47.069 --> 13:49.902
Both ships are disabled.

13:56.097 --> 13:57.680
We've lost 13 of the crew.

13:57.680 --> 14:02.204
22 injured... several critical.

14:03.737 --> 14:05.739
The Xindi?

14:05.739 --> 14:07.953
We've taken nine prisoners.

14:07.953 --> 14:10.874
But the brig was only designed for two.

14:10.874 --> 14:12.634
I'm not sure what to do with the others.

14:12.634 --> 14:15.435
Blow'em out the airlock.

14:15.435 --> 14:18.987
Put them in crew quarters under heavy guard.

14:18.987 --> 14:21.368
How are the repairs coming?

14:21.368 --> 14:24.980
We should have hull plating and torpedoes in the next couple of hours.

14:24.980 --> 14:27.104
The warp drive's another question.

14:27.104 --> 14:28.649
The starboard nacelle's a lost cause--

14:28.649 --> 14:31.097
half the coils have been fused.

14:31.097 --> 14:32.596
How long to repair them?

14:32.596 --> 14:34.685
If we were at Jupiter Station, three weeks.

14:34.685 --> 14:38.672
Out here... I'd have to rebuild the coil assembly from scratch.

14:38.672 --> 14:41.539
Six months, minimum.

14:41.539 --> 14:44.575
For now, the best I can give you is warp one-point-seven.

14:44.575 --> 14:48.667
We're not going to get very far at that speed.

14:50.616 --> 14:53.522
Resume our previous heading. Dismissed.

14:58.132 --> 15:01.223
How can we keep going with one warp engine?

15:01.223 --> 15:02.581
There's no other option.

15:02.581 --> 15:06.450
What in the world were you thinking when you rammed that ship?

15:06.450 --> 15:10.467
I chose the logical course of action.

15:10.467 --> 15:15.690
Since the Captain got sick, this mission's taken one wrong turn after another.

15:15.690 --> 15:21.708
If you believe I've acted improperly, I suggest you contact Admiral Forrest.

15:25.303 --> 15:29.419
You said we eventually found the weapon.

15:29.419 --> 15:33.595
How could we manage that without warp engines?

15:33.595 --> 15:40.026
We located the facility where the Xindi constructed the probe.

15:40.026 --> 15:44.643
But it had already been deployed.

15:44.643 --> 15:47.002
Earth?

15:47.002 --> 15:50.887
Destroyed.

15:56.625 --> 16:00.580
They didn't stop at your homeworld.

16:00.580 --> 16:04.611
They attacked every human outpost they could find.

16:04.611 --> 16:10.192
Mars, Alpha Centauri, Vega Colony...

16:10.192 --> 16:15.574
all were destroyed.

16:15.874 --> 16:19.703
How many of us are left?

16:21.070 --> 16:23.444
Less than 6,000.

16:45.342 --> 16:50.067
We're on the fifth planet in the Ceti Alpha system.

16:50.067 --> 16:54.631
It's far from the Expanse.

16:54.631 --> 16:58.126
What happened to the crew?

16:58.126 --> 17:02.426
Most of them are still aboard the ship.

17:02.426 --> 17:10.021
It's in orbit, patrolling this system.

17:10.877 --> 17:17.490
How did... all these people get here?

17:17.490 --> 17:23.118
Survivors from human colonies realized they needed a place to take refuge.

17:23.118 --> 17:25.791
Several convoys headed for this system.

17:25.791 --> 17:28.932
One of them was led by Enterprise.

17:30.696 --> 17:32.947
There's a ship approaching at high warp.

17:32.947 --> 17:36.131
It's Vulcan.

17:36.131 --> 17:41.008
They're hailing us.

17:41.008 --> 17:42.390
Ambassador.

17:42.390 --> 17:45.180
I need to speak with you, T'Pol.

17:48.132 --> 17:50.468
Come in.

17:53.391 --> 17:56.592
That uniform doesn't suit you, "Captain."

17:56.592 --> 18:01.214
I doubt you traveled all this way to criticize my attire.

18:01.214 --> 18:04.333
I want you to return with me to Vulcan.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.837
I am no longer under your authority.

18:06.837 --> 18:11.485
It's not an order, it's a request... for your own safety.

18:11.485 --> 18:12.945
Two weeks ago, the High Command

18:12.945 --> 18:16.787
received a distress call from the Earth convoy in the Mutara system.

18:16.787 --> 18:19.084
By the time our ships reached them,

18:19.084 --> 18:22.547
they found nothing but a field of debris.

18:22.547 --> 18:25.922
The weapon signatures were Xindi.

18:26.920 --> 18:30.794
Even if your ships do manage to reach Ceti Alpha,

18:30.794 --> 18:34.252
it's most likely you'll find an armada waiting for you.

18:34.252 --> 18:37.537
We're prepared to confront them.

18:42.126 --> 18:45.456
It was a mistake ordering you to leave Enterprise.

18:45.456 --> 18:49.222
It forced you to make an impulsive decision.

18:49.222 --> 18:50.832
If you return with me now,

18:50.832 --> 18:55.606
the High Command is prepared to reinstate your rank.

18:55.606 --> 18:57.460
I won't leave them.

18:57.460 --> 19:00.915
Them... or him?

19:00.915 --> 19:05.402
There are specialists on Vulcan that can help Archer.

19:05.402 --> 19:06.746
You'd take him as well?

19:06.746 --> 19:10.097
If you return to Vulcan.

19:10.097 --> 19:12.939
You owe the humans nothing.

19:12.939 --> 19:16.308
They chose to leave earth before they were ready.

19:16.308 --> 19:20.594
If they'd accepted our counsel, this tragedy would have been avoided.

19:20.594 --> 19:22.939
We could have saved them.

19:22.939 --> 19:24.226
How?

19:24.226 --> 19:27.463
We held back their warp program for 100 years.

19:27.463 --> 19:30.710
A policy which you supported.

19:30.710 --> 19:33.476
If we would have helped them develop faster ships,

19:33.476 --> 19:34.560
better defenses...

19:34.560 --> 19:39.276
Your emotional attachment to Archer is clouding your logic.

19:44.141 --> 19:50.276
We'll be within range for another 30 hours... should you reconsider.

20:01.728 --> 20:03.325
Come in.

20:05.957 --> 20:09.684
Did things go well with the Vulcans?

20:09.684 --> 20:10.907
How did you know that they were...?

20:10.907 --> 20:13.885
There was obviously a reason I chose these quarters.

20:13.885 --> 20:16.441
You can see a lot from this window.

20:16.441 --> 20:19.312
What did they want?

20:19.312 --> 20:22.450
They were here to replenish our supplies.

20:22.450 --> 20:25.069
Huh.

20:25.961 --> 20:29.970
I've been thinking about everything you told me.

20:29.970 --> 20:32.830
I realize I'm not fit to command the ship,

20:32.830 --> 20:37.221
but there's got to be some way I can help.

20:37.221 --> 20:40.724
I could give Trip a hand in Engineering.

20:40.724 --> 20:44.136
We tried something similar to that a few months ago.

20:44.136 --> 20:46.760
It was uncomfortable for you.

20:46.760 --> 20:50.240
So I'm supposed to stay locked up in my quarters all day?

20:50.240 --> 20:55.274
You often take Porthos for a walk, visit the classrooms on D-Deck.

20:55.274 --> 20:58.140
The children enjoy hearing about our earlier missions.

20:58.140 --> 21:02.446
In other words, just stay out of the way.

21:03.254 --> 21:06.603
After nearly a year, we arrived in this system.

21:06.603 --> 21:09.531
Our convoy was thenly one to reach it.

21:09.531 --> 21:12.047
The others had all been attacked and destroyed.

21:12.047 --> 21:16.188
This planet is barely Minshara-Class.

21:16.188 --> 21:19.661
Maybe we should've picked one with a little more blue and green on it.

21:19.661 --> 21:23.035
I'd like to head down with a survey team and start scouting for colony sites.

21:23.035 --> 21:24.586
You're needed on Enterprise.

21:24.586 --> 21:27.460
The civilian leaders are going to want to meet with you.

21:27.460 --> 21:30.013
Me? You're the one they deal with.

21:30.013 --> 21:33.717
I'm resigning my commission.

21:36.101 --> 21:38.094
You're sure you want to do this?

21:38.094 --> 21:42.644
Captain Archer will be better off on the surface with the others.

21:42.644 --> 21:45.664
He'll need a caretaker, someone he trusts.

21:45.664 --> 21:48.983
I can't be in two places at the same time.

21:48.983 --> 21:52.713
You're making one hell of a sacrifice.

21:52.713 --> 21:55.899
Why?

21:55.899 --> 21:57.927
I have my reasons.

21:58.127 --> 22:04.398
The civilian ships were disassembled for their components and raw materials.

22:04.398 --> 22:08.822
We used them to construct the settlement.

22:15.316 --> 22:22.530
At this point, you often wonder if you're the victim of some elaborate deception.

22:22.530 --> 22:27.903
The thought did cross my mind.

22:27.903 --> 22:29.822
Margaret Mullin.

22:29.822 --> 22:34.351
You met her when you were 24 years old, during flight school in San Francisco.

22:34.351 --> 22:36.576
The night before you graduated,

22:36.576 --> 22:41.928
you asked her to marry you outside of her apartment on Westgate Avenue.

22:41.928 --> 22:43.561
She turned you down.

22:43.561 --> 22:47.535
She said she didn't want to become a "Starfleet widow."

22:47.535 --> 22:50.053
How the hell did you know that?

22:50.053 --> 22:56.075
Our relationship has evolved over the years.

22:57.297 --> 23:04.514
Exactly how far has it evolved?

23:06.825 --> 23:10.974
Nothing seems to have changed since your last exam.

23:10.974 --> 23:16.438
Is this why you came all the way from Denobula, to give me a check-up?

23:16.438 --> 23:20.658
You didn't tell him?

23:20.658 --> 23:23.248
After this settlement was established, it became clear that

23:23.248 --> 23:26.839
I was never going to find a treatment for your condition if I remained here.

23:26.839 --> 23:29.454
So I returned home and consulted with some

23:29.454 --> 23:33.924
of the finest neurosurgeons and quantum theorists on Denobula.

23:33.924 --> 23:35.714
My colleagues believed there was no way

23:35.714 --> 23:41.197
to destroy these parasites short of vaporizing you in a subspace implosion.

23:41.197 --> 23:45.525
They assured me the technology to do what was required did not exist,

23:45.525 --> 23:49.801
and they were correct.

23:49.801 --> 23:54.057
It took almost a decade to develop,

23:54.057 --> 23:56.261
but now I'm ready to put it to the test.

23:56.261 --> 23:58.398
The procedure requires tremendous amounts of energy,

23:58.398 --> 24:04.779
levels that can only be produced in the reactor of a warp-powered starship.

24:04.779 --> 24:08.045
We're going to Enterprise.

24:19.392 --> 24:22.307
It's good to see you, sir.

24:23.394 --> 24:26.364
Captain Tucker.

24:26.364 --> 24:29.173
I don't think you need to call me "sir" anymore.

24:29.173 --> 24:31.005
Old habits.

24:31.005 --> 24:33.191
I apologize for the low lighting.

24:33.191 --> 24:36.426
We're running on reserve power.

24:36.426 --> 24:38.825
Antimatter's at a premium these days.

24:38.825 --> 24:42.008
How long has it been since you took command?

24:42.008 --> 24:44.448
Nine years.

24:44.448 --> 24:49.140
I've, uh, got some people who'd like to say hello.

24:50.889 --> 24:52.899
You're looking well, sir.

24:52.899 --> 24:54.554
Thank you...

24:54.554 --> 24:56.687
Commander, is it?

24:56.687 --> 24:59.456
Actually, I've just been promoted to Captain.

24:59.456 --> 25:02.795
Malcolm's taking over the Intrepid from Ramirez.

25:02.795 --> 25:05.256
Did everyone get their own ship while I was gone?

25:05.256 --> 25:07.362
Not everyone, sir.

25:07.362 --> 25:11.063
Hoshi.

25:12.648 --> 25:16.426
There's a reception in the mess hall if you're feeling up to it.

25:16.426 --> 25:20.359
A visit to Engineering may be in order first.

25:28.827 --> 25:33.705
I'll be using a highly-focused anti-proton beam to eradicate the parasites.

25:33.705 --> 25:36.545
We'll start with this cluster today.

25:36.545 --> 25:39.481
Why not remove all of them at once?

25:39.481 --> 25:41.281
This procedure's never been attempted before.

25:41.281 --> 25:43.179
We should move cautiously.

25:43.179 --> 25:44.635
When can you begin?

25:44.635 --> 25:47.406
The emitters should be calibrated within the hour.

25:58.826 --> 26:00.756
Come in.

26:06.322 --> 26:08.599
You left the reception early.

26:08.599 --> 26:11.600
It was a little disturbing.

26:11.600 --> 26:17.834
From my perspective, I saw most of those people just a few hours ago.

26:25.580 --> 26:31.393
It couldn't have been easy for you, telling me the same story over and over again for 12 years.

26:31.393 --> 26:37.049
I don't always tell it in detail.

26:37.049 --> 26:42.249
I hope I've told you this before, but...

26:42.249 --> 26:48.115
I'm very grateful for everything you've done for me.

26:49.942 --> 26:51.479
If this works...

26:51.479 --> 26:58.763
Phlox to Captain Archer.

26:58.763 --> 27:02.071
- Go ahead.
- We're ready.

27:05.762 --> 27:07.940
I'm picking up an intermittent duranium signature.

27:07.940 --> 27:09.332
Is it a ship?

27:09.332 --> 27:10.704
I'm not certain.

27:10.704 --> 27:13.328
It's in a close orbit around the sun.

27:13.328 --> 27:15.738
We'd better check it out.

27:15.738 --> 27:18.107
Lay in a course.

27:30.645 --> 27:33.397
Increase to 800 millicochranes.

27:41.082 --> 27:43.360
Increase to 850.

28:15.743 --> 28:20.030
There's a small vessel just outside the chromosphere.

28:20.030 --> 28:21.492
Is it Xindi?

28:21.493 --> 28:23.458
The hull configuration doesn't match.

28:23.458 --> 28:27.178
There's one bio-sign onboard.

28:27.178 --> 28:29.283
Open a channel.

28:29.283 --> 28:32.378
This is Captain Charles Tucker.

28:32.378 --> 28:37.980
Is there something we can help you with?

28:40.328 --> 28:42.974
- He's moving.
- Follow him.

28:42.974 --> 28:44.775
His warp coils are charging.

28:44.775 --> 28:47.900
Target one of his nacelles.

28:54.712 --> 28:57.606
Bring it into the launch bay.

29:00.651 --> 29:02.780
Just as my simulations predicted.

29:02.780 --> 29:06.188
There's no trace of the parasites I targeted.

29:08.634 --> 29:12.635
Well, I understand I may have a passenger on my voyage home.

29:12.635 --> 29:15.778
I'm remaining at the settlement for the time being.

29:15.778 --> 29:20.486
He may need my help during his recovery.

29:20.486 --> 29:25.416
Have you told the Captain how you feel about him?

29:27.442 --> 29:31.406
It's obvious you've become quite attached.

29:31.406 --> 29:33.520
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

29:33.520 --> 29:36.320
Vulcans experience the same emotions as any other species.

29:36.320 --> 29:37.757
They're simply better at hiding them.

29:37.757 --> 29:39.556
I'm not "hiding" anything.

29:39.556 --> 29:41.215
He risked his life to save me.

29:41.215 --> 29:45.496
I'm merely repaying a debt.

29:45.496 --> 29:48.802
I can only imagine what it must have been like.

29:48.802 --> 29:51.692
Spending all those years in that house, learning so much about him.

29:51.692 --> 29:57.905
Yet he remembers nothing about you beyond the day he became ill.

29:59.153 --> 30:05.909
If we're successful, perhaps things will be different.

30:13.287 --> 30:16.672
There's a discrepancy in these scans.

30:16.672 --> 30:18.938
What is it?

30:18.938 --> 30:20.979
I deal in Rigelian flamegems.

30:20.979 --> 30:24.346
I was waiting for a prospective buyer when you attacked me.

30:24.346 --> 30:26.676
You picked an odd place for a business transaction.

30:26.676 --> 30:28.429
We searched your ship.

30:28.429 --> 30:29.973
We didn't find any cargo.

30:29.973 --> 30:31.764
That's because I jettisoned it all.

30:31.764 --> 30:33.963
I thought you were going to arrest me.

30:33.963 --> 30:36.343
Flamegems are illegal in this region.

30:36.343 --> 30:38.916
We found your species in our Vulcan database.

30:38.916 --> 30:41.777
It appears Yridians are information dealers.

30:41.777 --> 30:45.525
Who hired you?
Was it the Xindi?

30:45.525 --> 30:49.039
Xindi?

30:49.039 --> 30:52.181
Maybe we didn't give his vessel a close enough look.

30:52.181 --> 30:56.859
Go back to the launch bay, use a plasma torch and slice that ship into neat little pieces.

30:56.859 --> 31:01.497
Keep at it until you find some evidence that supports his story.

31:01.497 --> 31:05.992
You're going to destroy my ship?

31:05.992 --> 31:09.406
It's not you they want.

31:09.406 --> 31:11.520
It's the Denobulan.

31:11.520 --> 31:13.320
Phlox?

31:13.320 --> 31:15.121
I was hired to follow him.

31:15.121 --> 31:16.534
Hired by who?!

31:16.534 --> 31:19.345
I don't know, they work through intermediaries.

31:19.345 --> 31:25.075
I was paid to follow the Denobulan if he ever left his homeworld.

31:25.075 --> 31:27.369
What did you tell them?

31:27.369 --> 31:29.912
Answer me.

31:34.233 --> 31:35.172
What's the problem?

31:35.172 --> 31:37.877
Your engineers won't let us continue with the Captain's treatment.

31:37.877 --> 31:39.100
Those were my orders.

31:39.100 --> 31:40.533
Look, I'd do anything to help the Captain,

31:40.533 --> 31:41.982
but we've got bigger problems at the moment.

31:41.982 --> 31:44.299
This may be the only solution to your problems, Captain.

31:44.299 --> 31:48.371
Destroying these parasites is most likely the key to saving humanity, and Earth.

31:48.371 --> 31:49.352
Earth's gone.

31:49.352 --> 31:51.854
This image was taken a few minutes ago.

31:51.854 --> 31:55.709
You can see the region where I eradicated the first cluster of parasites.

31:55.709 --> 31:57.532
It's gone in this image, as well.

31:57.532 --> 32:01.140
- Doc...
- This scan was taken over 12 years ago.

32:01.140 --> 32:05.826
The cluster has disappeared from all the scans I've taken over the last 12 years.

32:05.826 --> 32:08.138
It's as though it never existed at all.

32:08.138 --> 32:09.823
By destroying the organisms in the present,

32:09.823 --> 32:11.887
we appear to have neutralized them in the past.

32:11.887 --> 32:13.563
We know they're from another spatial domain.

32:13.563 --> 32:16.179
Apparently, they also exist outside of time.

32:16.179 --> 32:17.912
If we can eliminate all of the parasites,

32:17.912 --> 32:21.369
it's possible the Captain's infection will never have occurred.

32:21.369 --> 32:23.132
History may be altered.

32:23.132 --> 32:25.363
Captain Archer will have remained in command of Enterprise.

32:25.363 --> 32:28.566
Our mission in the Expanse could have an entirely different outcome.

32:28.566 --> 32:30.349
We only have to divert power for a few hours.

32:30.349 --> 32:33.744
I am certain I can complete the procedure in that time.

32:33.744 --> 32:35.512
I'm sorry.

32:35.512 --> 32:38.127
We need all the power we've got for the weapons.

32:38.127 --> 32:42.039
If the Xindi are on the way, there's very little we can do to stop them.

32:42.039 --> 32:44.638
Well, we can't just run up the white flag.

32:44.638 --> 32:47.539
Bridge to Captain Tucker.
You'd better get up here, sir.

32:47.539 --> 32:49.271
I'm on my way.

32:49.271 --> 32:51.501
We'll talk about this later.

32:57.854 --> 33:01.021
I'm getting a signal from one of our sentry probes.

33:01.021 --> 33:03.873
Six Xindi ships have entered the system.

33:14.081 --> 33:15.712
Charge the phase-cannons.

33:17.471 --> 33:21.722
- Is everyone in position?
- Aye, sir.

33:21.722 --> 33:23.362
The Xindi ships are in range.

33:23.362 --> 33:24.860
Fire.

33:29.201 --> 33:30.851
Our shields are holding.

33:30.851 --> 33:32.373
Nice to know they work in combat.

33:32.373 --> 33:35.217
Remind me to send a thank you note to General Shran.

33:36.259 --> 33:37.308
Adjust your heading.

33:37.308 --> 33:39.069
3-1-0-mark-2-7.

33:39.069 --> 33:40.959
Full impulse.

33:40.959 --> 33:43.676
Two of their ships are breaking off.

33:43.676 --> 33:44.826
They're following us.

33:44.826 --> 33:46.204
What about the others?

33:46.204 --> 33:48.841
Still heading toward the planet.

33:58.350 --> 34:00.662
Insectoid ship's been damaged.

34:00.662 --> 34:02.065
They're losing power.

34:02.065 --> 34:04.138
Target the second one.

34:07.991 --> 34:10.464
Their engine's disabled.

34:10.464 --> 34:15.109
The other Xindi ships have changed their heading.

34:17.123 --> 34:22.730
I think we're going to find out how much of a beating these new shields can take.

34:25.589 --> 34:27.348
T'Pol?

34:27.348 --> 34:31.413
- What's happening?
- Jonathan, you need to rest.

34:31.413 --> 34:33.737
- Where are you going?
- To the bridge.

34:33.737 --> 34:37.541
I'm not going to just lie here while they destroy what's left of humanity.

34:38.944 --> 34:40.839
You should remain here.

34:52.261 --> 34:54.690
Forward shielding's at 52%.

35:00.164 --> 35:02.242
Turbolifts are down.

35:16.682 --> 35:18.379
Intrepid's taken a direct hit.

35:18.379 --> 35:19.879
They've lost their port nacelle.

35:19.879 --> 35:21.590
Tell them to withdraw.

35:24.833 --> 35:26.741
Our phase-cannons are down.

35:33.657 --> 35:35.647
Our forward shield's collapsing!

35:35.647 --> 35:38.836
Hull breaches on B-Deck. C-Deck!

35:40.858 --> 35:42.638
They're targeting the bridge!

35:42.638 --> 35:44.543
Hard to port!

36:06.739 --> 36:08.808
The bridge is gone.

36:11.652 --> 36:13.062
T'Pol to Phlox.

36:13.062 --> 36:14.583
Go ahead.

36:14.583 --> 36:17.323
Meet us in Engineering.
We're going to finish the procedure.

36:17.323 --> 36:18.808
Understood.

36:18.808 --> 36:20.994
We don't have time to worry about parasites right now.

36:20.994 --> 36:23.050
That's not necessarily true.

36:23.050 --> 36:25.517
Come with me, I'll explain.

36:44.188 --> 36:46.890
I'm sorry, Captain, the chamber's been damaged.

36:50.129 --> 36:53.777
Didn't you say we could destroy the parasites with a subspace implosion?

36:53.777 --> 36:55.743
- Yes, but that'll mean...
- Can we create one?

36:55.743 --> 36:58.472
We would have to overload three plasma injectors.

36:58.472 --> 37:00.680
That would send a feedback pulse through the reactor.

37:00.680 --> 37:02.128
You'll destroy the ship.

37:02.128 --> 37:04.646
At this point, it won't make much of a difference.

37:04.646 --> 37:06.284
You two get to a shuttlepod.

37:06.284 --> 37:07.564
They're only after humans.

37:07.564 --> 37:11.189
If this doesn't work out you'll still have a chance.

37:15.013 --> 37:16.653
That's an order.

37:16.653 --> 37:20.982
With all due respect, you were relieved of command.

37:26.159 --> 37:27.989
One of the plasma injectors was damaged.

37:27.989 --> 37:29.953
We'll have to replace it.

37:29.953 --> 37:32.585
They're in supply locker "C" on the upper level.

37:55.303 --> 37:57.232
We're back in business!

38:11.402 --> 38:13.043
Phlox!

38:15.908 --> 38:17.619
Phlox?

38:25.896 --> 38:27.013
How much longer?

38:27.013 --> 38:29.719
Stand by.

39:53.811 --> 39:58.510
How do you feel?

39:58.510 --> 40:03.053
Like a shuttlepod landed on my head.

40:03.053 --> 40:06.304
- What's our status?
- We've cleared the anomalies.

40:06.304 --> 40:09.090
There is minor damage to the starboard nacelle.

40:09.090 --> 40:12.045
Repairs should be complete within the hour.

40:12.045 --> 40:13.894
You suffered a mild concussion.

40:13.894 --> 40:17.181
I'd like to keep you overnight for observation.

40:17.181 --> 40:20.309
All right, doctor.

40:24.430 --> 40:26.679
You could've been seriously injured.

40:26.679 --> 40:29.645
I told you to leave me behind.

40:29.645 --> 40:33.367
Fortunately, I don't take orders from you.

40:33.367 --> 40:36.398
I believe you wanted to see this.

40:36.398 --> 40:37.583
Rosemary's Baby?

40:37.583 --> 40:40.100
You were obviously looking forward to it,

40:40.100 --> 40:43.631
and since you're not going to be able to attend tonight...

40:45.019 --> 40:47.333
Thanks.

40:47.333 --> 40:51.949
Oh, would you mind bringing me another pillow?

41:05.083 --> 41:08.188
Would you turn down the lights just a little?

41:14.808 --> 41:15.869
Anything else?

41:15.869 --> 41:17.933
No, that's great.

41:19.416 --> 41:25.723
You know... you'd make a wonderful nurse.
