00:04.300 --> 00:07.833
Once monsieur finds out
it was my light that
torched that dress...

00:07.867 --> 00:09.833
I'm guessing my days here
 are pretty much numbered.

00:09.867 --> 00:13.033
A body has been found on the
 rear corner of your property.

00:13.067 --> 00:14.967
Buried in a shallow grave.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.267
PAUL: You thought this 
 was the best place to hide 
 your stupid mistake?

00:18.300 --> 00:19.667
I thought there was
 no-one out there.

00:19.700 --> 00:22.800
Except a curious dog
 and a morbid little girl.

00:22.833 --> 00:25.933
-My mother
 killed that sailor.
 -I already knew that.

00:25.967 --> 00:27.800
-(BLADE SLICES)
 -Does Claude know?

00:27.833 --> 00:29.667
Promise me he'll never know.

00:31.567 --> 00:34.733
If I can ever be helpful,
 don't hesitate to ask.

00:36.933 --> 00:39.000
That's a nice pen.
 Special gift.

00:39.033 --> 00:43.367
The Germans replaced the gold
 band with ivory during
 the war, and that was ivory.

00:43.400 --> 00:45.767
I saw you yesterday -
 in church.

00:45.800 --> 00:47.167
I don't go to church.

00:47.200 --> 00:49.133
We introduced him
to a very lovely couple.

00:49.167 --> 00:51.000
The adoption will soon
 be formalised.

00:51.033 --> 00:53.133
-Where's the money?
 -I'll hold on to that.

00:53.167 --> 00:55.333
-You don't think
 things through, Nina.
 -It's my money.

00:55.367 --> 00:58.433
-I want it back.
-You can't buy back
what's no longer yours.

00:58.467 --> 01:00.867
No man is interested in
 raising someone else's child.

01:00.900 --> 01:03.200
-Bravo!
 -(CHEERING)

01:03.233 --> 01:04.467
Bravo!

01:04.500 --> 01:08.367
Enjoy your moments.
 They never get as good
 as this again.

01:09.900 --> 01:11.300
I need to tell you something.

01:11.333 --> 01:14.300
Who the hell do you think
 you're talking to?

01:15.600 --> 01:18.567
Do you want me to tell Claude
 who you really are?

01:18.600 --> 01:21.300
Because I will. I will!

01:24.700 --> 01:27.133
* I love Paris

01:27.167 --> 01:29.700
* In the springtime

01:31.567 --> 01:33.567
* I love Paris

01:33.600 --> 01:36.667
* In the fall

01:37.933 --> 01:39.767
* I love Paris

01:39.800 --> 01:41.267
* In the winter

01:41.300 --> 01:42.800
* When it drizzles

01:43.833 --> 01:46.067
* Say, I love Paris

01:46.067 --> 01:48.733
* In the summer 
 when it sizzles *

01:48.767 --> 01:51.333
* I love Paris

01:51.367 --> 01:55.067
* Why, oh, why 
 do I love Paris? *

01:55.067 --> 01:57.167
* Because my love

01:57.200 --> 01:58.767
* Is near

02:01.733 --> 02:03.567
Bravo!

02:18.067 --> 02:19.700
(REMEMBERS) Bravo!

02:22.400 --> 02:27.867
Can you tell me about your
 first time at the property?

02:27.900 --> 02:29.667
I was there
 less than an hour.

02:29.700 --> 02:31.833
The agent showed me
 many that morning.

02:31.867 --> 02:34.267
-But you made
 an offer right away?
 -It was charming.

02:34.300 --> 02:37.367
And felt a million kilometres
 from Paris.

02:37.400 --> 02:40.100
Well, certainly the Paris
that you travel in.

02:41.867 --> 02:43.567
If you don't mind
my asking...

02:43.600 --> 02:45.933
was that Rita Hayworth
 I saw yesterday?

02:45.967 --> 02:48.900
-I guess it was.
 -But you must know her?

02:48.933 --> 02:51.067
* Put the blame on me

02:51.100 --> 02:53.267
I don't get to the cinema
very often, Inspector.

02:53.300 --> 02:55.767
Of course.
 Why should you buy a ticket

02:55.800 --> 02:59.667
when these lovely ladies
disrobe for you
free of charge?

03:01.800 --> 03:06.067
Have you entertained any
 guests out at the cottage?

03:06.100 --> 03:08.200
Other than your wife.

03:10.733 --> 03:13.567
Have you already interviewed
 someone on my staff?

03:13.600 --> 03:15.567
Victor Bastide.

03:15.600 --> 03:20.267
He's the only one at
 the atelier who's aware
 of my personal affairs.

03:21.300 --> 03:23.300
Then you have
 entertained a guest?

03:25.300 --> 03:27.833
I've had a recent liaison.

03:27.867 --> 03:31.167
But I've never brought her
 to the cottage. Never.

03:33.300 --> 03:38.067
Have you loaned
the place to anyone else
since you purchased it?

03:38.067 --> 03:42.133
My mother and brother
 stayed out there
 for a few nights last month.

03:42.167 --> 03:45.200
Ah. That might explain
 the voices.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.267
The little girl next door

03:48.300 --> 03:51.067
claimed to overhear
 an argument
 in the dead of night.

03:51.067 --> 03:53.800
Woke her up.

03:53.833 --> 03:55.500
What were they arguing about?

03:55.533 --> 03:59.333
It's unclear.
 This child's not
 the most reliable witness.

03:59.367 --> 04:03.500
May I ask when it began,
this liaison?

04:03.533 --> 04:05.667
It's a new development.

04:09.233 --> 04:11.367
Do you anticipate this taking
 much longer, Inspector?

04:11.400 --> 04:13.333
I have a very busy day ahead.
 Interviews--

04:13.367 --> 04:15.700
May I have a contact number
 for your mother?

04:22.100 --> 04:24.400
And your brother.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.500
I may have to speak
 to them both.

04:38.933 --> 04:40.700
(LIVELY CHATTER)

04:51.467 --> 04:53.233
I hope you don't think
 I'm prying.

04:53.267 --> 04:55.400
I never breathe
when I can pant.

04:55.433 --> 04:58.067
I just want to know
 everything.

04:58.867 --> 05:01.300
Where did you go
after the show?

05:01.333 --> 05:04.567
-I went home.
 -Oh.

05:04.600 --> 05:07.067
Private party. Who with?

05:07.067 --> 05:08.533
My mother.

05:08.567 --> 05:11.433
Then I drank some warm milk
 and fell into bed.

05:11.467 --> 05:15.367
Oh, God! Please hold on to
 that for as long as you can.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.333
And the freckles.

05:17.367 --> 05:19.367
Your mother
 must be very proud.

05:19.400 --> 05:22.533
Pardon, madame. The
magazine's photographer
has concept boards for--

05:22.567 --> 05:26.133
Forget the boards.
 The concept is sitting
 right here.

05:26.167 --> 05:28.667
You could shoot this girl
anywhere.

05:28.700 --> 05:31.800
This was on my desk. One of
 the girls took the message.

05:32.867 --> 05:35.067
Fan mail already?

05:38.400 --> 05:41.200
If you'll excuse me.
 I must go.

05:41.233 --> 05:43.467
Don't say yes to him
till I've seen the ring.

05:43.500 --> 05:46.667
Anything less than ten carats
 is impolite.

05:57.967 --> 05:59.700
-Nina.
-I can't talk right now.

05:59.733 --> 06:03.533
-What's wrong?
 -Nothing. I um...
 I'll find you later.

06:11.367 --> 06:13.633
What's all this, then?
 Pictures from the show?

06:13.667 --> 06:16.733
I haven't developed anything
 from yesterday.

06:16.767 --> 06:20.233
Really? I figured
you'd be up all night
in your little dark room.

06:20.267 --> 06:24.267
Oh, I was up all night
in my little hotel room,
pacing.

06:24.300 --> 06:27.667
Monsieur Sabine left
 a message. He wanted to see
 me first thing this morning.

06:27.700 --> 06:30.267
-And what did he say?
 -He hasn't yet.

06:30.300 --> 06:32.533
He's probably still
 figuring out my bill

06:32.567 --> 06:34.533
for nearly torching
 the place.

06:36.667 --> 06:39.567
It's fine. I've already
 put the word out.

06:39.600 --> 06:43.233
"Got camera.
 Will work for food."

06:43.267 --> 06:46.967
That's too bad. I was looking
 forward to more adventures.

06:47.067 --> 06:48.800
So was I.

06:48.833 --> 06:52.067
I had this plan for a shoot
 at the Place de la Concorde,
 on roller skates.

06:52.067 --> 06:54.533
I don't even know
 if Nina skates or not.

06:58.067 --> 07:00.133
Good luck, Billy.

07:00.167 --> 07:02.533
You'll be missed.

07:10.067 --> 07:11.433
I told him
 that it looked like

07:11.467 --> 07:14.367
someone had been out there
 before your family arrived.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.200
You mentioned
 the glass in the sink?

07:16.233 --> 07:18.300
And the back window was open.

07:18.333 --> 07:21.633
What did you say when
he asked why you waited
so long to step forward?

07:21.667 --> 07:24.600
I didn't want to say anything
 that would compromise you...

07:24.633 --> 07:27.167
-or hurt your wife.
 -Well done.

07:28.267 --> 07:29.933
When will they talk
 to your brother?

07:29.967 --> 07:32.500
Hmm?
 Oh, don't worry about that.

07:35.067 --> 07:37.833
Will I have to speak
 to him again?

07:37.867 --> 07:39.500
Hopefully not.

07:39.533 --> 07:41.800
If I wasn't there
 with a guest, then...

07:41.833 --> 07:44.933
some local thug broke into
 the place to meet his victim.

07:44.967 --> 07:46.500
That's what I said.
 Could have been anyone.

07:46.533 --> 07:50.433
You don't have to do his job,
 Victor. Let him do the maths.

 Who wouldn't want Bergdorf's
 in their corner?

08:40.332 --> 08:43.167
Me. Who's calling
from New York?

08:43.200 --> 08:45.333
Marjorie spoke to 
 Harper's Bazaar.

08:45.367 --> 08:48.067
Why? We have
 an exclusive on your husband.

08:48.067 --> 08:49.800
It's not a cover, Eliette.

08:49.833 --> 08:52.133
It's just hosting
a small event.

08:52.167 --> 08:54.700
Bergdorf's would like
 to do a little tease.

08:54.733 --> 08:56.400
So does Rita Hayworth.

08:56.433 --> 09:00.433
She scribbled her number
 on a sheet of toilet paper
 and handed it to me.

09:00.467 --> 09:02.433
Is that an American custom?

09:02.467 --> 09:05.700
I couldn't tell if it was
her phone number
or her measurements.

09:05.733 --> 09:07.867
I would hope you'd know
 the difference, Maman.

09:07.900 --> 09:10.367
Where is this calling card?
 Did you flush it?

09:10.400 --> 09:14.200
Miss Hayworth's already
phoned this morning
and made an appointment.

09:14.233 --> 09:17.800
New York will have to wait.
 Right now, Paris is calling.

09:17.833 --> 09:21.200
The bell on your telephone
 is practically hoarse. Even
 the wife's had to answer it.

09:21.233 --> 09:23.333
I offered but dear Helen
got there first,

09:23.367 --> 09:26.267
before I could
 leap over the desk.

Charlotte.

Would you mind taking these
 up to the studio, please?

-(PHONE RINGS)
 -No. You get that, darling.

09:34.300 --> 09:36.167
I'll get one of my girls
to do it.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.433
CHARLOTTE: Paul Sabine.
 How can I help you?

09:38.467 --> 09:41.067
Have you spoken to Claude
since last night?

09:41.067 --> 09:43.200
I tried but there was
 no answer.

09:43.233 --> 09:46.100
Try again.
You need to speak to him.

09:46.933 --> 09:48.833
I'm sorry to interrupt.

09:48.867 --> 09:50.800
You said first thing
 in the morning.

09:50.833 --> 09:57.600
I did. But I was called into
 another appointment across
 town. We'll talk over there.

09:57.633 --> 10:00.000
CHARLOTTE: He'd be
 happy to see you, I'm sure.

10:02.333 --> 10:04.267
We're looking forward
 to seeing you.

10:04.300 --> 10:06.567
What was the appointment
across town?

10:07.767 --> 10:09.533
No idea.

10:13.967 --> 10:17.467
Monsieur Sabine, I only set
 that light up over there
 to get the best possible--

10:17.500 --> 10:19.233
-It's done.
-But I will pay you back.

10:19.267 --> 10:22.933
-Once I land something else--
 -Last night was
 a learning curve, Billy.

10:22.967 --> 10:25.733
For everyone.

10:25.767 --> 10:29.433
What? Are you saying
 you still want me to be here?

10:29.467 --> 10:32.333
There's an elaborate layout
 being shot here this week.

10:32.367 --> 10:34.633
Eliette's photographer
 is going to need help.

10:36.600 --> 10:40.200
-You want us both to shoot?
 -No. I said he needs help.

10:40.233 --> 10:42.500
Setting up props, lighting.

10:42.533 --> 10:45.333
Positioning the girls.
 Whatever's necessary.

10:46.500 --> 10:48.067
Sure.

10:49.433 --> 10:52.233
Do you want me to print the
 rolls from yesterday or...?

10:52.267 --> 10:54.500
That can wait.
 You missed a button.

10:57.167 --> 10:59.367
Charlotte, I'd like to see
 my diary, please.

10:59.400 --> 11:02.067
Yes, of course. Certainly.

11:02.067 --> 11:04.200

11:26.500 --> 11:29.133
Was this the best place
 to meet?

11:29.167 --> 11:31.667
It's the only place I knew
 that was in between.

11:31.700 --> 11:33.167
Here.

11:36.600 --> 11:40.667
Did you find out their name,
 the couple that have him?

11:40.700 --> 11:43.067
Please. Look,
 it's already been a month.

11:43.067 --> 11:46.767
-The longer he's with them--
 -It's only been
 a couple of days, Nina.

11:48.067 --> 11:50.100
What?

11:51.067 --> 11:53.833
He was only just adopted.

11:53.867 --> 11:56.800
-When you came back
 to the convent--
 -He was there?

11:58.267 --> 12:00.067
But the Mother Abbess
 told me--

12:00.100 --> 12:02.200
She wanted to protect him.

12:02.233 --> 12:04.333
And you.

12:04.367 --> 12:07.533
I don't need her protection.
 I need a name.

12:07.567 --> 12:09.367
Who has him?

12:09.400 --> 12:12.333
Those records are
 locked in a cabinet in
 the Mother Abbess's office.

12:12.367 --> 12:14.667
Then what are you doing here?

12:15.933 --> 12:17.800
I want to help you.

12:19.233 --> 12:21.233
I know how badly
 you want to see him.

12:21.267 --> 12:25.667
It might be easier for you
 to get him back if you had
 the father's support.

12:25.700 --> 12:27.800
Or his family's.

12:30.167 --> 12:32.333
Or at least
 your mother's support.

12:33.800 --> 12:37.067
Do you have that?

12:37.100 --> 12:41.767
Nina, Mother Abbess believes
 she's doing what's best
 for the children.

12:41.800 --> 12:43.333
Does she?

12:44.200 --> 12:46.667
I never even saw her
 pick one up.

12:47.667 --> 12:48.700
She doesn't.

12:50.133 --> 12:52.067
She never did with me.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.300
I'll get you a name.

13:03.133 --> 13:04.633
Let's meet here again.

13:07.333 --> 13:09.333

13:19.933 --> 13:21.767
You must be Billy.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.067
I'm Lewis Hayes.

13:24.067 --> 13:26.667
-You work for Jour de Mode? 
 -Guess again.

13:26.700 --> 13:28.200
Saturday Evening Post.

13:28.233 --> 13:31.133
-You called Charlie Fennan,
 looking for work?
 -Right. Yeah.

13:31.167 --> 13:32.833
-Yeah.
 -Damn.

13:32.867 --> 13:36.200
Every floor you climb,
 the birds just get prettier.

13:36.233 --> 13:39.067
-Who's on the roof?
 -I'm shocked
 you got past Charlotte.

13:39.067 --> 13:41.167
-Which one's Charlotte?
-Oh, you'd remember her.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.500
Ground floor.
 Makes Garbo look friendly.

13:43.533 --> 13:46.967
-If I'm keeping you
 from your work--
 -No, you're not.

13:47.067 --> 13:49.233
I offered my services,
 but...

13:49.267 --> 13:51.333
they said
 they couldn't use me.

13:51.367 --> 13:53.367
-Are you a reporter?
 -Novelist.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.200
But I'm helping some buddies
 start a magazine.

13:55.233 --> 13:57.300
We scraped together
 enough for a photographer.

13:57.333 --> 14:00.167
But... now that I
see your setup...

14:00.200 --> 14:02.533
this may not be so tempting.

14:09.100 --> 14:10.667
Where do I sign up?

14:19.600 --> 14:22.800
-Do you want some breakfast?
 -I had mine.

14:22.833 --> 14:24.467
Before I had lunch.

14:28.633 --> 14:31.867
Who's that from?
 The silent partner?

14:31.900 --> 14:35.300
This is from me.
 Trouvier could barely
 offer an apology.

14:35.333 --> 14:40.133
I was hoping to introduce you
 to him after the show, but...

14:40.167 --> 14:41.767
...I turned around
 and you were gone.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.067
I had to feed my cat.

14:47.167 --> 14:51.233
We have six orders placed
for the wedding gown.

14:52.833 --> 14:56.867
Mm? Charlotte just has to
 make sure none of the brides

14:56.900 --> 14:59.267
get married
 in the same country.

14:59.300 --> 15:02.200
-Shall we open this?
 -What for?

15:02.233 --> 15:03.967
What for? We did it, Claude.

15:04.067 --> 15:07.367
Our name is on the lips of
 every last fashion reporter
 in Paris.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.600
Eliette's given us
 her next cover...

15:09.633 --> 15:12.467
cleared out Le Cinq
 this afternoon so the press
 could lick our feet.

15:12.500 --> 15:14.333
And New York
 wants a taste, too.

15:14.367 --> 15:17.067
Every outfit we showed
 was ordered.

15:17.100 --> 15:19.533
Every single one.

15:19.567 --> 15:21.600
Rita Fucking Hayworth

15:21.633 --> 15:24.733
is scribbling her name
 on our toilet paper.

15:24.767 --> 15:28.767
The stars are finally aligned
 and we've got more...

15:37.833 --> 15:40.200
You can use the bedroom.

15:43.133 --> 15:45.600
Didn't realise
 you weren't alone.

15:54.233 --> 15:56.133
We'll do this later.

15:56.167 --> 15:59.267
Or... share this
with your friend.

16:02.800 --> 16:04.567
I'm gonna need
 more than that.

16:05.967 --> 16:07.733
Hm?

16:09.900 --> 16:12.733
I want to be
at the press conference.

16:12.767 --> 16:14.767
Sat at the table.

16:16.933 --> 16:20.267
Claude, you're gonna have
your hands full
just ordering supplies.

16:20.300 --> 16:22.300
That's not
 what I'm asking for.

16:24.133 --> 16:26.300
(COIN DROPS ON FLOOR)

16:30.167 --> 16:32.067
We'll talk about this later.

16:33.067 --> 16:35.600
I just want to sit
 at the table.

16:36.767 --> 16:39.067
You never wanted that.

16:39.067 --> 16:42.100
-I do now.
 -Careful what you wish for.

16:49.067 --> 16:51.633
The press conference
 is at five o'clock.

17:04.067 --> 17:07.567
You may not want your guest
 to hang around for breakfast.

17:07.599 --> 17:10.233
The next knock on your door
 might be a detective.

17:10.267 --> 17:12.267
There's an investigation
out at the cottage.

17:12.300 --> 17:14.532
They found a body
 buried in a shallow grave.

17:14.567 --> 17:17.633
What the hell
 are you talking about?

17:17.666 --> 17:22.666
Evidently,
 it's not that unusual.
 Small town, vigilantes.

17:22.700 --> 17:25.733
There are advantages to not
 sitting at the table, Claude.

17:34.633 --> 17:37.933
MOTHER ABBESS:
 "We received a note 
 from your daughter Nina."

17:37.967 --> 17:39.700
NUN: He was 
 only just adopted.

17:39.733 --> 17:42.900
MOTHER ABBESS:
 "Her note was accompanied by 
 a gift for our convent. Cash.

17:42.933 --> 17:46.300
The child has found 
 a suitable and loving home.

17:46.333 --> 17:50.267
But I would ask that you turn 
 to prayer and not interfere 
 with God's plan.

17:50.300 --> 17:54.500
This donation, 
 as much as we appreciate it, 
 cannot be accepted."

17:54.533 --> 17:55.900
(REMEMBERED VOICES)

17:55.933 --> 17:58.233
"I can't help but feel 
 that your daughter sent this

17:58.267 --> 18:00.833
for reasons 
 other than charity.

18:00.867 --> 18:04.567
We know this is a difficult 
 time for your daughter.

18:04.600 --> 18:07.433
-Turn to prayer..." 
 -...and not interfere...

18:07.467 --> 18:09.167
-I want to help you. 
 -...cannot be accepted.

18:09.200 --> 18:13.667
...a gift for our convent... 
 and not interfere 
 with God's plan.

18:13.700 --> 18:18.933
Ladies and gentlemen,
 fashion has to reflect
 the times we're living in.

18:18.967 --> 18:23.067
Monsieur Sabine understands
 that we've lost something

18:23.067 --> 18:26.067
that we need
 as much as oxygen.

18:26.067 --> 18:27.333
Hope.

18:28.300 --> 18:32.300
-I'm not speaking
out of turn?
-Not at all.

18:32.333 --> 18:36.267
Every new collection
 begins with a conversation.

18:36.300 --> 18:38.300
This one began
 with my lovely wife,

18:38.333 --> 18:40.800
whose desire
 to feel feminine again

18:40.833 --> 18:42.800
served as my inspiration.

18:42.833 --> 18:45.567
Yes, but your genius
 is understanding
 that every woman -

18:45.600 --> 18:48.700
including the working girl
 on the street -
 shares this desire.

18:48.733 --> 18:53.733
Monsieur Sabine proves that
 by plucking a lowly
 seamstress from his atelier

18:53.767 --> 18:55.867
and placing her
front and centre.

18:55.900 --> 18:58.633
That's what's revolutionary
 about this collection.

18:58.667 --> 19:01.400
-I never intended
a revolution.
-(LAUGHTER)

19:01.433 --> 19:06.300
I just thought it was time
 we closed the chapter
 on austerity, making do.

19:06.333 --> 19:10.167
But choosing that
 young woman projects
 the spirit of the hour.

19:10.200 --> 19:14.633
If a common girl
 can slip into the right dress
 and become a princess,

19:14.667 --> 19:17.333
well, that confirms the
 social relevance of fashion.

19:17.367 --> 19:19.100
There's nothing common
 about her!

19:19.133 --> 19:22.733
What's common
 is believing a pretty frock
 gives you class. It doesn't.

19:27.433 --> 19:30.067
Eliette's point is well made.

19:30.067 --> 19:32.467
A young girl like that
 just wants a scarf,

19:32.500 --> 19:35.533
a handbag, a lipstick,
 that makes her believe

19:35.567 --> 19:38.700
that romance is waiting
 around every corner.

19:43.300 --> 19:45.300
(CHATTER)

20:02.633 --> 20:05.800
What are those for?

20:05.833 --> 20:08.667
Monsieur wanted me
 to wear those
 for the magazine shoot.

20:08.700 --> 20:10.033
Oh.

20:10.067 --> 20:12.500
Leave that one.
 The sleeve is torn.

20:12.533 --> 20:16.733
Juliette will bring it
 downstairs when it's ready.

20:16.767 --> 20:20.267
Charlotte said you rushed out
 early this morning
 for an appointment.

20:21.300 --> 20:22.733
I just...

20:23.800 --> 20:25.700
...needed to take a walk.

20:25.733 --> 20:28.100
I've barely left this
 building for days.

20:28.133 --> 20:30.267
-I wanted to sit in the park.
 -Alone?

20:35.700 --> 20:37.967
I had a feeling...

20:38.000 --> 20:41.100
you might have gone
 to meet somebody.

20:41.133 --> 20:44.667
Maybe you wanted to be
 with someone your own age.

20:45.900 --> 20:48.433
And who would that be?

20:48.467 --> 20:50.600
I don't know.

20:50.633 --> 20:52.800
(SIGHS)

20:52.833 --> 20:55.700
This is yours.
You did earn it.

20:59.100 --> 21:01.267
After last night...

21:01.300 --> 21:04.167
I expect you'll be
 earning a lot more.

21:06.100 --> 21:08.067
You've been given a gift,
Nina.

21:08.100 --> 21:12.367
You can use this to forget
 about past mistakes
 and move on.

21:15.967 --> 21:18.767
Not when you see him
 every day.

21:18.800 --> 21:20.267
See who?

21:20.300 --> 21:22.767
Who do you see every day?

21:24.067 --> 21:26.367
-You told me
Monsieur Sabine--
-It's Claude.

21:28.567 --> 21:30.067
What?

21:34.467 --> 21:36.100
(LAUGHS)

21:38.833 --> 21:40.533
Stop.

21:42.267 --> 21:44.400
(LAUGHS)

21:44.433 --> 21:46.433
Stop laughing!

21:47.433 --> 21:49.267
I have to laugh.

21:49.300 --> 21:51.067
I thought you were safe.

21:51.100 --> 21:53.333
All this time
I've been angry with you,

21:53.367 --> 21:55.067
when I should have been
 angry with me.

21:55.100 --> 21:57.333
Me trusting him.

21:59.333 --> 22:02.600
Trusting he will
never touch you.

22:02.633 --> 22:06.067
He doesn't like women that
 way. He's safe. He's safe.

22:07.100 --> 22:10.767
Who initiated this?
 You or him?

22:10.800 --> 22:14.267
Well, you weren't this angry
 when you thought
 it was his brother.

22:14.300 --> 22:16.067
Why would you do this?

22:16.933 --> 22:19.600
What were you thinking?

22:19.633 --> 22:22.267
You can't possibly
hate yourself that much.

22:27.967 --> 22:30.133
(CHATTER STOPS)

22:38.367 --> 22:40.367
(LIVELY CHATTER)

22:46.900 --> 22:49.067
CLAUDE: Another.

22:56.467 --> 22:58.467
You might want to
pace yourself.

22:58.500 --> 23:01.233
We've been invited back to
 Eliette's for cocktails.

23:01.267 --> 23:02.967
Mm-hm.

23:03.067 --> 23:06.800
Fun. Is mine gonna be
 served in a dog bowl?

23:06.833 --> 23:09.100
Claude, she is a huge fan.

23:10.467 --> 23:11.833
I know.

23:11.867 --> 23:14.767
Until she's not, because
there's a new magazine
on the rack every month.

23:14.800 --> 23:17.133
Can I get another one,
 please?

23:17.167 --> 23:19.333
I don't need her permission.

23:23.400 --> 23:25.567
You know,
 it's never sat right with me,

23:25.600 --> 23:29.067
this arrangement
 between the two of you.

23:29.100 --> 23:31.167
But I learned
 from my first marriage

23:31.200 --> 23:34.067
that no-one on the outside
 has the right to judge.

23:34.100 --> 23:37.067
Claude, I love you both.

23:37.067 --> 23:39.433
And I've just come to believe
 that...

23:40.300 --> 23:42.767
...maybe it's worked this far

23:42.800 --> 23:47.167
because you and your brother
 are driven by completely
 different impulses.

23:47.200 --> 23:51.467
You want the world to match
 what's swirling round
 in your head, and...

23:52.700 --> 23:54.667
...Paul... I don't know.

23:54.700 --> 23:59.133
Sometimes I think Paul
 just wants to even the score.

23:59.167 --> 24:01.067
Even what score?

24:03.633 --> 24:06.467
He'll never have
what you have.

24:06.500 --> 24:09.300
Your mother reminds him of
 that every chance she gets.

24:09.333 --> 24:11.833
You took the long way
 to the powder room.

24:11.867 --> 24:13.767
Oh. I'll just be a minute.

24:13.800 --> 24:17.067
No rush. I've told Eliette
 we'll do cocktails
 another time.

24:17.067 --> 24:19.333
I've got plenty to do
 back at the office.

24:26.867 --> 24:30.500
I don't understand.
 Did Eliette invite Claude?

24:30.533 --> 24:32.067
Or was that Helen's idea?

24:32.100 --> 24:35.833
Monsieur just asked me
 to arrange a car
 to pick up his brother.

24:35.867 --> 24:39.167
You'd think Monsieur
would be tired of giving
so many interviews.

24:39.200 --> 24:42.467
-Didn't he start his day
with one?
-I'm not sure.

24:44.133 --> 24:46.600
Well, he should stop talking

24:46.633 --> 24:49.067
and let the clothes
 speak for themselves.

24:51.067 --> 24:53.067
Fortier?

24:53.100 --> 24:55.467
Why do I know that name?

24:58.200 --> 25:01.433
Red-headed lady. 
 Didn't I meet her last night?

25:01.467 --> 25:05.500
Came with a gentleman.
 Tall, silver-haired.

25:05.533 --> 25:06.967
He was distinguished.

25:07.067 --> 25:11.567
She looked like something
checked out of a doll
hospital - prematurely.

25:11.600 --> 25:15.667
I'm not familiar with her.
 Perhaps a friend
 of Marjorie Sutter.

25:15.700 --> 25:18.067
Not the lady I'm thinking of.

25:21.267 --> 25:24.067
You've written that name
three times, dear.

25:24.067 --> 25:26.533
(PHONE RINGS)

25:28.067 --> 25:31.367
Paul Sabine.
 This is Charlotte speaking.

25:31.400 --> 25:34.867
I'm afraid not. He's
already left for the day.

25:34.900 --> 25:37.367
Monsieur has left as well.

25:37.400 --> 25:40.767
She is, actually. Would you
 like to speak with her?

25:41.767 --> 25:43.800
It's a gentleman for you,
madame.

25:43.833 --> 25:45.633
Inspector Bompard.

26:31.800 --> 26:33.733
Where have you been?

26:33.767 --> 26:36.767
Never met a locked door
 you couldn't pick, have you?

26:36.800 --> 26:38.800
That detective stopped by.

26:38.833 --> 26:41.200
He wants to interview me.
Tomorrow.

26:41.233 --> 26:43.433
He's not as stupid
 as he looks.

26:43.467 --> 26:46.300
-Did you tell him that?
 -He'll be calling in Claude
 next.

26:46.333 --> 26:48.633
-Yes, he might.
 -We can't let that happen.

26:48.667 --> 26:52.100
There's only so much
 I can do, Maman.

26:52.133 --> 26:54.933
I'm still playing catch-up,
 remember?

26:54.967 --> 26:57.467
You need to pay him off
 before he questions
 your brother.

26:57.500 --> 26:59.400
You want me to bribe
 the Inspector?

26:59.433 --> 27:01.400
Why not? You've got
 cash coming in now.

27:01.433 --> 27:03.767
Offer him a piece of
 the business if you have to.

27:03.800 --> 27:05.300
-That's not gonna happen
-Paul.

27:05.333 --> 27:08.833
The war's over! We're not
selling off our future.

27:08.867 --> 27:12.500
What future?
How can they crown you
if you don't have a head?

27:12.533 --> 27:15.667
My head's not gonna be
 the one on the block.

27:17.233 --> 27:19.833
You won't walk away
 smelling any better than me.

27:19.867 --> 27:22.633
-I can promise you that.
-Stop strategising.

27:22.667 --> 27:24.600
Your thoughts only get you
 in more trouble.

27:24.633 --> 27:27.467
-What is your plan?
 -Go home, Maman.

27:27.500 --> 27:29.533

 there were intruders?

28:15.833 --> 28:19.433
I'm convinced that whoever
 owned that cottage
 before my son

28:19.467 --> 28:21.733
had some unfinished business.

28:23.100 --> 28:27.067
Are you relying on intuition,
 madame, or evidence?

28:27.067 --> 28:29.067
That place is haunted.

28:29.067 --> 28:31.533
The floors
 grab at your heels,

28:31.567 --> 28:33.067
the walls have eyes.

28:33.067 --> 28:34.633
I couldn't wait to leave.

28:34.667 --> 28:38.833
During your stay,
 did you discover
 anything that suggested

28:38.867 --> 28:40.867
an actual stranger
 had been in the house?

28:40.900 --> 28:44.467
We had to step over a rotting
 carcass to get inside.

28:45.800 --> 28:48.433
This was no Easter Bunny,
Inspector.

28:48.467 --> 28:52.200
That animal
 had been savagely killed
 and left there as a warning.

28:52.233 --> 28:53.933
Who do you think
left it there?

28:53.967 --> 28:55.633
It wasn't a fox.

28:55.667 --> 28:59.433
It was a "gift" from someone
 who didn't want us there.

28:59.467 --> 29:01.533
I begged my son
 not to buy that place.

29:01.567 --> 29:04.633
He dismissed me
 as a superstitious old fool.

29:04.667 --> 29:07.167
But the cards never lie!

29:07.200 --> 29:10.367
-The cards?
 -The Tower card was upright.

29:10.400 --> 29:13.700
That always spells disaster.

29:13.733 --> 29:17.467
-May I show you?
 -Uh... That's not necessary,
 madame.

29:18.500 --> 29:21.133
Perhaps,
 if you have the stomach

29:21.167 --> 29:23.433
to look at some photographs
 of the victim?

29:23.467 --> 29:27.367
I'm trying to construct
an identity with very few
puzzle pieces.

29:27.400 --> 29:31.500
Inspector,
 the world we can't see

29:31.533 --> 29:35.067
is much more revealing
 than the one we can.

29:42.667 --> 29:44.900
Come back! Stop!

29:44.933 --> 29:47.467
Come back! Bad boy.

29:47.500 --> 29:49.067
Bad!

29:51.167 --> 29:54.133
Sorry, monsieur.
 I tried to stop him.

29:54.167 --> 29:57.933
You needn't bother.
 He probably enjoyed it
 more than I would have.

29:57.967 --> 30:00.133
I only lick the plate
 when it's cake.

30:00.167 --> 30:03.400
-Are you a gendarme?
 -No. I'm the new owner.

30:03.433 --> 30:06.133
But I haven't stayed here
long enough
to brush my teeth.

30:06.167 --> 30:08.700
Do you live next door?

30:08.733 --> 30:11.567
I'm not allowed
 past those trees any more.

30:11.600 --> 30:12.833
Maman gets very cross.

30:12.867 --> 30:15.800
Oh, yes. That's right.
 There's been some trouble.

30:15.833 --> 30:18.200
Are you... Josette?

30:18.233 --> 30:21.300
-How do you know that?
 -Lucky guess.

30:21.333 --> 30:23.600
You met my little brother
Claude.

30:23.633 --> 30:25.300
He's not little.

30:25.333 --> 30:28.333
(LAUGHS) No, you're right.
 Not so much any more.

30:28.367 --> 30:33.133
But I happen to know he was
 very taken with your castle.

30:33.167 --> 30:35.533
-I've shut it down.
 -That's a shame.

30:35.567 --> 30:38.400
-Did it have a drawbridge?
 -And a moat, too.

30:39.267 --> 30:41.033
But it's all gone now.

30:41.067 --> 30:43.300
I haven't been back since
they took Heinrich away.

30:43.333 --> 30:46.033
-Heinrich?
 -My prisoner.

30:46.067 --> 30:48.300
It's the only German name
I know.

30:48.333 --> 30:50.400
Is "Gustav" German?

30:51.433 --> 30:53.000
I think it is.

30:53.033 --> 30:55.600
Did you have
 more than one prisoner?

30:55.633 --> 30:59.067
No. But somebody else tried
 to hide in there with him.

30:59.100 --> 31:01.067
He came one night
and pounded on the door.

31:01.100 --> 31:03.300
They were screaming
 at each other.

31:03.333 --> 31:06.133
But Heinrich
 wouldn't let him in.

31:06.167 --> 31:09.133
He may have been hiding there
 for the whole war.

31:09.167 --> 31:12.067
That's what
 my grandfather says.

31:12.067 --> 31:14.200
Makes sense.

31:15.367 --> 31:18.167

 wouldn't it?

31:46.833 --> 31:49.067
What? No.

31:53.633 --> 31:57.100
I don't blame you. It's been
 by the radiator all day.

31:57.133 --> 31:59.500
It's more like a baked apple.

32:01.467 --> 32:04.433
Why did you pretend it wasn't
 you who I saw in church?

32:06.067 --> 32:08.833
Maybe I didn't want
 to be seen.

32:08.867 --> 32:12.267
Is that just there or...
all the time?

32:18.133 --> 32:20.467
I know what they say
 about you, Victor.

32:21.967 --> 32:23.700
But I don't care.

Please.

-Actually, I'm wearing--
 -I know what you're wearing,
 madame. We created it.

33:29.533 --> 33:34.200
It has an earthy note.
 It plays on the jasmine
 but doesn't smother it.

33:34.233 --> 33:36.233
It reminds me of something.

33:36.267 --> 33:39.167
-Fresh lingerie.
-Yes. That, too.

33:39.200 --> 33:41.833

 for this collection.

43:50.300 --> 43:52.333
Hey. What are you doing here?

43:52.367 --> 43:55.233
Aren't they shooting
 that magazine spread today?

43:56.833 --> 43:58.833
What's happened?

43:58.867 --> 44:00.700
Nina, what's wrong?

44:01.733 --> 44:03.633
Erm...

44:06.067 --> 44:08.367
I need a place to live.

44:10.433 --> 44:13.767
Is your mother
all turned out about
that modelling business?

44:15.267 --> 44:17.600
It's not that. It's just...

44:17.633 --> 44:19.967
I need to be on my own.

44:20.067 --> 44:22.833
I can't... share a room
 with her any more.

44:22.867 --> 44:25.067
It's just...

44:27.400 --> 44:31.567
Well, I suppose if you can
 tolerate seeing Dominique
 without her war paint,

44:31.600 --> 44:34.567
you could always spend
a few nights in her tub.

44:37.867 --> 44:40.133
Something better
will come up.

44:41.367 --> 44:43.433
I'll ask around.

44:54.433 --> 44:58.167
We will figure this out,
Nina. I promise.

45:03.167 --> 45:05.500
I should go. I'm late.

45:46.167 --> 45:48.400
This was just dropped off
for you.

45:51.933 --> 45:54.267
Has Monsieur
 spoken to you yet?

45:54.300 --> 45:55.967
No. Why?

45:56.067 --> 45:58.233
He was wondering
 if you'd seen Nina.

45:58.267 --> 46:02.067
-She was supposed to
 be here an hour ago.
 -I don't know.

46:04.867 --> 46:07.367
Wait! Who dropped this off?

46:13.733 --> 46:15.733
Wait. Where's the film?

46:20.667 --> 46:22.433
(CORK POPS)

46:23.300 --> 46:24.767
That's impressive.

46:26.267 --> 46:29.567
Where'd you bag this?
 On safari?

46:29.600 --> 46:31.500
On flea market.

46:32.567 --> 46:34.067
Oh.

46:35.067 --> 46:36.767
Mm.

46:36.800 --> 46:38.333
Nice.

46:38.367 --> 46:41.933
Oh, and the chipped china
really brings out
the vintage.

46:41.967 --> 46:44.667
Yeah, sorry.
 Couldn't find a glass.

46:44.700 --> 46:47.067
It's either these or my boot.

46:51.667 --> 46:53.833
Something happen
with your bride?

46:53.867 --> 46:57.067
-Hm?
 -The girl from the show
 who was here earlier.

46:57.067 --> 46:59.200
Another house
trying to steal her away?

46:59.233 --> 47:00.700
No. We wouldn't
let that happen.

47:00.733 --> 47:02.867
I can see why.
 She was a knockout.

47:02.900 --> 47:06.167
Certainly showcased
 your brother's talent.

47:06.200 --> 47:08.900
I imagine when you find
 someone who inspires you--

47:08.933 --> 47:10.800
She inspires me.

47:11.933 --> 47:13.400
I'm the talent.

47:13.433 --> 47:16.233
-I know all about
your talents.
-No, you don't.

47:18.100 --> 47:20.067
No-one does.

47:23.800 --> 47:26.167
Well, maybe you should
 change that.

47:27.600 --> 47:29.067
Toot your own horn a bit.

47:29.067 --> 47:31.133
Although I don't know
 why you'd want to.

47:31.167 --> 47:33.067
All that attention
 is such a burden.

47:33.100 --> 47:36.400
Flying under the radar
 is much more fun.

47:36.433 --> 47:38.800
You can get drunk
before lunch.

47:44.267 --> 47:46.267
I don't get it.
 It doesn't make sense.

47:46.300 --> 47:48.700
The desk clerk
 didn't send it to the maison.

47:48.733 --> 47:51.367
Maybe it was the night shift.
 It's got your name
 in the bag.

47:51.400 --> 47:53.267
Well,
 why did they take my film?

47:53.300 --> 47:56.800
Could've fallen out.
 It could still be under
 one of those sticky tables.

47:57.933 --> 48:00.733
Wait, Lewis. That's him.
That's the guy.

48:00.767 --> 48:03.933
-Billy, sit down. Sit down!
 -That is the goon
 Sabine hired to shadow me.

48:03.967 --> 48:07.067
That goon is following me,
 not you.

48:07.100 --> 48:08.833
He's American.

48:08.867 --> 48:10.433
Look at the shoes.

48:11.067 --> 48:12.467
Sit down.

48:13.800 --> 48:16.100
Why's he following you?

48:16.133 --> 48:18.900
Cos I'm starting a rag
 with two writers
 who support the communists

48:18.933 --> 48:20.533
who are part of
 the government here.

48:20.567 --> 48:23.400
The White House sees that
 as one step away from Moscow.

48:23.433 --> 48:27.067
(LAUGHS) Don't want us
smuggling radical French
ideas into our poetry.

48:27.067 --> 48:29.300
Lewis, that guy
 was in the bar last night--

48:29.333 --> 48:31.833
And he'll be here tomorrow.
 As long as I am.

48:31.867 --> 48:35.167
Billy, the Government
 of National Unity here
 won't last.

48:35.200 --> 48:36.867
This country's on the verge
 of a civil war.

48:36.900 --> 48:39.233
He wants to make sure
 I'm on the right side of it.

48:39.267 --> 48:42.100
This is about a lot more
than pretty dresses.

48:58.167 --> 49:00.333
(MUSIC MUFFLES SPEECH)

49:01.700 --> 49:03.700
And... beautiful.

49:05.300 --> 49:08.567
If you'd be so kind
 as to simply centralise
 yourself here...

49:10.767 --> 49:13.233
He doesn't like women 
 that way. He's safe.

49:13.267 --> 49:17.500
It might be easier for you 
 to get him back if you had 
 the father's support.

49:17.533 --> 49:19.700
-(THEY CHUCKLE)
 -You can't possibly 
 hate yourself that much.

49:24.933 --> 49:26.433
I'm not a chair!

49:27.600 --> 49:28.633
Well...

49:33.200 --> 49:35.100
Who blew out her pilot light?

49:35.133 --> 49:37.067
The week might've
 caught up with her.

49:37.100 --> 49:38.533
-If you could show...
 -Hey.

49:38.567 --> 49:42.267
(WHISPERS) This is
 obviously awful but...

49:42.300 --> 49:44.133
keep that dress on.

49:44.167 --> 49:48.267
I got an idea with roller
skates. Do you skate?

49:48.300 --> 49:50.967
OK. Downhill only. But
 I'll keep hold of the belt

49:51.067 --> 49:54.067
and I'll have one hand free
 to take shots from behind.

50:06.467 --> 50:08.633
(SOFTLY) Inspector Bompard
 is in your office.

50:16.133 --> 50:19.500
Inspector.
 Did we have an appointment?

50:19.533 --> 50:22.900
We did not. I hope
 you'll forgive the intrusion.

50:22.933 --> 50:25.900
That's fine.
But why's my mother here?

50:25.933 --> 50:29.800
I asked to be here.
 Claude couldn't be reached.

50:32.667 --> 50:35.267
Has there been some
development in the case?

50:35.300 --> 50:40.000
We found new evidence
that shed some light
on the victim's identity.

50:41.667 --> 50:45.633
That little girl next door
 was more insightful
 than we thought.

50:45.667 --> 50:48.100
-Was she?
-Yes.

50:48.133 --> 50:51.267
We found a personal item
inside the barn

50:51.300 --> 50:53.467
that might've belonged
 to the victim.

50:53.500 --> 50:54.800
A fountain pen.

50:54.833 --> 51:00.067
Certainly substantiates that
 he was very likely a German.

51:00.100 --> 51:02.700
Possibly hiding
 in the countryside for years.

51:04.167 --> 51:06.400
Your instincts were spot on,
 too, Maman.

51:06.433 --> 51:08.700
Those walls did have eyes.

51:08.733 --> 51:10.767
(LAUGHS WEAKLY)

51:13.533 --> 51:15.567
Thank you, Inspector.

51:15.600 --> 51:17.600
No. Thank you.

51:17.633 --> 51:20.733
I'm sorry we had to
 trouble you with this.

51:20.767 --> 51:23.067
PAUL: It's no trouble at all.

51:25.900 --> 51:28.167
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

51:32.333 --> 51:34.333
(CHATTER)

51:39.633 --> 51:41.467
Billy.

51:41.500 --> 51:44.400
Get your camera.
 I've asked Eliette
 to let you take this shot.

51:45.233 --> 51:48.067
(LAUGHS) Monsieur Sabine...

51:50.933 --> 51:52.633
Ah, thank you.

52:01.833 --> 52:03.667
OK. All right. That's nice.

52:03.700 --> 52:06.700
Monsieur Sabine,
could you just...
Great. Hold that.

52:08.667 --> 52:10.700
ELIETTE: Perfect.

52:10.733 --> 52:15.067
The mighty sorcerer
 surrounded by
 all his apprentices.

52:15.100 --> 52:16.733
BILLY: Really great.

52:18.900 --> 52:21.633
OK. Really nice. Keep
 your eyes to me. Everybody.

52:23.200 --> 52:24.667
Here we go.

52:30.133 --> 52:31.433
Wait just here.
