00:01.669 --> 00:03.871
<i>Previously on "Secrets</i>
of Sulphur Springs"...

00:04.004 --> 00:05.073
My dad said
it was all his fault.

00:05.206 --> 00:06.940
That has to mean
he did something
to Savannah.

00:07.075 --> 00:09.077
Think it's Savannah?

00:09.210 --> 00:12.413
<i>** Here at dear Camp Tremont **</i>

00:12.546 --> 00:14.848
Your brother is missing,
and you're worried
about a ghost?

00:14.982 --> 00:16.016
This is serious!

00:16.150 --> 00:17.051
So is this!

00:17.185 --> 00:18.552
Not all my memories here
were happy.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.020
What happened to Savannah

00:20.154 --> 00:22.123
is not something I've ever
talked about with anyone.

00:22.256 --> 00:23.957
Hello?
Can you hear me?

00:31.065 --> 00:32.900
I-- I dared her
to spend the night...

00:33.033 --> 00:34.368
<i>alone in the basement.</i>

00:34.502 --> 00:35.936
<i>Savannah must have</i>
found the portal.

00:36.070 --> 00:38.372
<i>Which means</i>
<i>she could still be alive</i>
somewhere in time.

00:39.540 --> 00:40.408
1960?

00:41.342 --> 00:43.077
Big storm's coming.
It's not safe here.

00:43.211 --> 00:44.778
Wait. Someone's inside.

00:44.912 --> 00:46.247
Boy, am I glad
to see you.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.381
Listen, we don't have
a lot of time.

00:47.515 --> 00:49.150
I really need you
to come with us.

00:49.283 --> 00:50.818
It could change
everything.

00:50.951 --> 00:52.486
<i>We need to get back</i>
to the hatch now.

00:53.121 --> 00:54.355
Go!

00:56.624 --> 00:58.559
Where is Savannah?
-She was right behind me.

01:17.345 --> 01:19.280
-Mom, what happened?
You okay?

01:19.413 --> 01:21.415
I just wasn't looking.
There was something--

01:23.083 --> 01:25.753
You look like you saw...
a ghost.

01:26.554 --> 01:27.421
No.

01:28.055 --> 01:29.056
It was right there...

01:30.023 --> 01:30.924
in the mirror.

01:35.229 --> 01:37.030
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.768
Let's go. Now!

01:42.670 --> 01:44.138
No more excuses, Ben.

01:44.272 --> 01:46.240
No more finger pointing.
Just tell me.

01:46.374 --> 01:47.941
What did you do
to Savannah?

01:52.213 --> 01:53.181
Jess...

01:55.015 --> 01:56.884
I'm sorry I blamed you.

01:58.252 --> 02:00.788
Minute I got to town,
it was the only thing
I wanted to say--

02:00.921 --> 02:03.491
Save the apology.
I just want the truth.

02:06.660 --> 02:07.795
I found this
for the cops.

02:07.928 --> 02:09.397
Harper wears it
all the time.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.066
It's got her scent
all over it.

02:14.635 --> 02:15.803
For the dogs?

02:15.936 --> 02:17.838
Like in the movies?

02:18.972 --> 02:20.073
That's great.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.042
Thank you, baby.

02:24.645 --> 02:25.679
It's Sarah.

02:27.215 --> 02:28.949
-Any news?
I'm at the house...

02:29.082 --> 02:31.252
<i>Something very strange</i>
is going on here, Ben.

02:31.385 --> 02:32.753
<i>We're getting out now.</i>

02:32.886 --> 02:34.222
Sarah, what's wrong?

02:34.355 --> 02:36.224
-Sarah?

02:40.928 --> 02:43.964
♪**♪

03:05.085 --> 03:06.287
Sorry, Ms. Campbell.

03:06.420 --> 03:07.788
No one answered,
so I let myself in.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.057
Oh, it's fine.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.992
You just scared me,
that's all.

03:12.125 --> 03:12.926
Do you have news?

03:13.060 --> 03:14.928
Yes. We may have
found something.

03:15.062 --> 03:17.431
<i>Sarah?</i>
Sarah, what's wrong?

03:18.366 --> 03:19.867
Dad, are you there?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.569
Yeah, you've got
to get here fast.

03:25.005 --> 03:27.308
Savannah!
Hold on, we're coming!

03:27.441 --> 03:28.876
Pull harder.
We have to get it open!

03:29.009 --> 03:30.678
I'm pulling
as hard as I can!

03:33.414 --> 03:34.315
Savannah!

03:34.448 --> 03:35.949
Griffin...

03:36.083 --> 03:38.118
Griffin, stop pushing
and listen. We have to go!

03:38.952 --> 03:40.354
What? Why?

03:40.488 --> 03:42.089
Because there's no point.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.492
The hatch is stuck.
That tree must've
fallen on it.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.360
-Come on.
-No!

03:46.494 --> 03:47.928
Savannah was
right behind us.
She could be hurt.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.997
Exactly. Which is why
we have to get out of here

03:50.130 --> 03:52.165
and go back though
the portal again,
then home.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.268
Home? How's that going
to help her?

03:54.402 --> 03:55.636
That was a huge storm.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.971
The second we get back,
we'll check records
from 1960.

03:58.105 --> 04:01.041
Old newspapers,
anything that can tell us
if a girl was found.

04:01.174 --> 04:04.177
You mean,
if she was injured or...

04:05.178 --> 04:07.315
There's no time
to think about it.
Let's go.

04:18.225 --> 04:19.627
Once we get
past the camp office,

04:19.760 --> 04:21.362
it's a straight shot
to the hatch.

04:43.517 --> 04:44.985
Got here
as fast as we could.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.920
What is it?
I couldn't tell.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.422
But I thought
maybe you can.

04:48.556 --> 04:50.624
Boot print. Fairly fresh.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.460
Do you recognize the brand,
the tread?

04:54.261 --> 04:56.096
Size looks close.

04:56.229 --> 04:57.665
Maybe Harper's from last night?

04:57.798 --> 04:59.066
What I was thinking.

05:00.167 --> 05:01.369
You asked for
something of Harper's.

05:01.502 --> 05:02.770
Ah, that's perfect.

05:06.374 --> 05:07.307
Go!

05:08.175 --> 05:09.343
He's got something.

05:30.197 --> 05:31.865
Wait, everyone--
I know where they are.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.373
-Griffin?
-Harper?

05:39.507 --> 05:41.475
Back here.
-Oh!

05:45.679 --> 05:47.014
You called the police?

05:47.147 --> 05:49.282
-Mom, I'm so sorry--
-Are you okay?

05:49.417 --> 05:51.419
We were so worried.
-Where were you?

05:51.552 --> 05:53.153
Uh, we walked to Rayville,

05:53.286 --> 05:54.422
to catch a bus.

05:54.555 --> 05:55.689
Yeah.

05:55.823 --> 05:57.157
So you were trying
to run away?

05:57.290 --> 05:58.225
Um...

05:59.192 --> 06:00.761
Kind of, yeah.

06:00.894 --> 06:01.862
Sorry.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.363
It was mostly my idea.

06:03.497 --> 06:05.265
I just wanted
to get out of here.

06:05.399 --> 06:06.734
We both did.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.335
Because we were
keeping you apart?

06:09.069 --> 06:10.438
Or is it because
of your dad?

06:11.338 --> 06:13.574
A little of both,
I guess.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.208
Why did you come back?

06:16.209 --> 06:17.344
Well, I, um...

06:17.478 --> 06:19.279
Because Griffin
talked me into it.

06:20.514 --> 06:21.381
Yep.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.851
You know what?
I'm gonna need another hug.

06:28.288 --> 06:29.757
Can we go home now?

06:29.890 --> 06:32.726
There's an important...
assignment I have to finish.

06:33.694 --> 06:36.564
Fine, but we've got
a stop to make first.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.251
Why are we here?

07:02.956 --> 07:04.291
When we were
looking for you,

07:04.424 --> 07:05.993
Topher said
you come here a lot...

07:06.126 --> 07:07.895
to feel closer
to your dad.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.031
I thought maybe
that's why you ran away...

07:12.099 --> 07:14.034
because I kept you away
from him...

07:14.167 --> 07:14.968
and the memories.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.436
That's not why we left.

07:16.570 --> 07:19.640
Even so,
I realize it was wrong,
what I was doing.

07:20.708 --> 07:21.742
Not talking about it.

07:25.078 --> 07:26.113
You want to lead the way?

07:27.080 --> 07:28.115
I'll do it.

07:41.394 --> 07:43.363
Toph, I know
you don't really
remember your dad,

07:43.497 --> 07:46.233
but you look and sound
more like him each day.

07:46.366 --> 07:47.801
Figured that's where
I got my good looks.

07:47.935 --> 07:49.737
It's true, you did.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.304
Very handsome.

07:53.106 --> 07:54.542
I've always wondered...

07:54.675 --> 07:56.209
what made you
fall in love with Dad?

07:56.977 --> 07:59.012
Well, a lot of things,

07:59.146 --> 08:01.248
but mostly because...

08:02.382 --> 08:04.151
he could make me laugh
like no one else.

08:05.753 --> 08:07.921
He also knew
exactly what to say
to tick me off.

08:08.055 --> 08:10.658
He used to love
pushing my buttons.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.627
Kinda like
someone else I know.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.163
How did you meet?

08:17.698 --> 08:20.000
When we were kids...

08:21.301 --> 08:22.502
at Camp Tremont,
believe it or not.

08:23.971 --> 08:26.607
Guess you could say,
he was the one good thing
to come out of that place.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.441
Really?
That long ago?

08:28.576 --> 08:30.243
It was the last day.

08:30.377 --> 08:32.980
I was going home,
and my duffel was huge.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.047
He offered to help.

08:35.282 --> 08:37.785
Darn thing must've weighed
more than he did.

08:38.752 --> 08:41.021
He had this goofy grin
on his face,

08:41.154 --> 08:43.223
and he stuck his hand out
and he said,

08:43.356 --> 08:44.925
"Hi, I'm Chris."

08:46.126 --> 08:48.295
His voice broke.
I remember it so clearly.

08:48.428 --> 08:49.797
We just laughed.

08:55.202 --> 08:58.038
I'm sorry I haven't talked
more about your father.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.208
It's just--

09:01.341 --> 09:03.944
After the accident,
when we lost him,

09:04.077 --> 09:06.780
I... didn't know
what to say...

09:08.816 --> 09:09.650
to anyone.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.588
You guys became my rock.

09:17.725 --> 09:19.292
And I love you both
so much.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.200
I'm sorry, Ben.
It's just too much.

09:27.334 --> 09:28.802
I can't do this anymore.

09:28.936 --> 09:30.137
Do what?
What are you talking about?

09:30.270 --> 09:31.438
What do you think?

09:31.571 --> 09:33.106
I've had enough.
I'm done.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.943
The kids and I
are moving back to Chicago.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.077
Okay, wait.

09:37.210 --> 09:38.545
I know it seems like
nothing's going right

09:38.679 --> 09:40.347
-since we moved here.
Seems like?

09:40.480 --> 09:42.582
That's an understatement.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.251
Look, Ben, I've tried,

09:44.384 --> 09:47.354
but I'm starting to believe
this place really is haunted.

09:48.488 --> 09:51.324
Fine, then we'll fix it.
We'll bring someone in or--

09:51.458 --> 09:53.326
No. This ends now.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.162
The secrets,

09:55.295 --> 09:57.164
the conversations
with Jess.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.700
I mean, you lied to me
about knowing Savannah.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.168
What else are you hiding?

10:11.011 --> 10:13.313
Wait, Dad told you
he knew Savannah?

10:14.447 --> 10:15.849
Griff, uh...

10:15.983 --> 10:17.751
Just go to bed.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.112
You are two hours early.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.514
Yes! I thought
I'd get a jump
on the day.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.382
By breaking and entering?

10:49.516 --> 10:51.651
So I could do
some extra research

10:51.785 --> 10:53.586
-for a history project.
-Mm-hmm?

10:54.421 --> 10:55.756
What's this project about?

10:55.889 --> 10:57.490
-The Great Storm of 1960.
-Oh.

10:57.624 --> 10:58.926
The internet has
a zillion links

10:59.059 --> 11:00.127
but not enough pictures.

11:00.260 --> 11:03.596
But lucky for you,
before there was the internet,

11:03.731 --> 11:05.132
before there were laptops,

11:05.265 --> 11:07.968
there was
this neat little thing

11:08.101 --> 11:09.036
called microfilm.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.971
Newspapers, periodicals,

11:11.104 --> 11:13.340
all squeezed down
into these little rolls.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.609
-The school has some?
-Oh, going way, way back.

11:17.778 --> 11:20.413
The Great Storm of 1960...

11:20.547 --> 11:22.582
Uh, you may or may not know,

11:22.716 --> 11:26.386
but I am an expert
on local history and lore.

11:26.519 --> 11:27.654
So you remember it?

11:28.789 --> 11:31.658
1960?
Honey, do I look that old?

11:31.792 --> 11:34.661
I know of it
and about it.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.263
But I'll tell you this,

11:36.396 --> 11:39.800
that storm changed
a lot of lives in this town.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.477
Is Dad back?

11:51.544 --> 11:52.712
Not yet.

11:52.846 --> 11:55.082
Zoey? Wyatt? Breakfast.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.052
Have you tried
calling him yet?

11:59.920 --> 12:01.822
I'm sure your dad
will be home soon.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.423
Just sit. Eat.

12:06.459 --> 12:09.229
He... He seemed
pretty upset last night.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.031
I mean, you both did.

12:11.164 --> 12:13.433
Everything will be fine
once we're back in Chicago.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.667
Wait, that's definite?

12:15.568 --> 12:17.270
Yeah, I thought
you'd be excited.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.739
Well... Yeah, but...

12:21.141 --> 12:23.343
things have changed now.
Kinda like it here.

12:24.211 --> 12:26.513
-Because of Harper?
-And you know...

12:26.646 --> 12:28.248
all of it.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.151
Well, it's what's
best for this family.

12:32.152 --> 12:33.453
It'll all work out.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.688
Exactly what you said
when we moved in.

12:36.323 --> 12:37.157
And it almost did.

12:38.325 --> 12:39.993
After you eat, you need
to start packing up your room.

12:40.127 --> 12:42.495
Now?
What about school?

12:42.629 --> 12:44.397
I already called and told 'em
you're not coming.

12:44.531 --> 12:45.966
You'll start back
at your old school next week.

12:46.099 --> 12:46.934
-No, but I--
-Hey!

12:47.835 --> 12:49.336
Just pack.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.271
Wyatt? Zoey?

13:02.916 --> 13:04.651
-Still at it?
-Uh-huh.

13:05.853 --> 13:07.687
1962?

13:07.821 --> 13:09.522
I thought you
were researching the storm.

13:09.656 --> 13:12.725
Yes, but I'm also interested
in how the community rebuilt.

13:12.860 --> 13:14.394
Like what happened
to people.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.396
Some moved away.
Some stayed.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.166
You've developed
quite a passion

13:19.299 --> 13:20.500
for Sulphur Springs history.

13:21.534 --> 13:24.437
Yes, it's just fun
to imagine what it was like,

13:24.571 --> 13:25.638
being a kid back then.

13:27.274 --> 13:30.143
Well, finish up.
Classes are about to start.

13:33.413 --> 13:34.614
Savannah.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.393
Griffin, what's going on?
Why aren't you at school?

13:46.526 --> 13:48.161
<i>Trust me,</i>
it's not my choice.

13:48.295 --> 13:49.496
What's up?

13:49.629 --> 13:50.864
Amazing news.

13:50.998 --> 13:52.065
You're not gonna
believe this.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.133
Look!

13:54.734 --> 13:55.768
Whoa!

13:55.903 --> 13:57.304
Is that Savannah?

13:57.437 --> 14:00.673
At the grand re-opening
of The Tremont in 1962.

14:00.807 --> 14:02.309
<i>That's two years</i>
after the storm.

14:02.442 --> 14:03.410
Exactly.

14:04.711 --> 14:07.114
-That's great.
-I know, right?

14:07.247 --> 14:09.016
<i>Okay, give me a few minutes</i>
and I'll be right over.

14:09.149 --> 14:10.150
What?

14:10.283 --> 14:11.851
Wait. No, no. I--

14:11.985 --> 14:13.954
Griffin, we have
to go back. Now.

14:14.087 --> 14:16.256
<i>I know, and I would,</i>

14:16.389 --> 14:17.790
<i>-but I, uh--</i>
<i>-If you're grounded,</i>
it's fine.

14:17.925 --> 14:20.293
-We'll just figure out--
-Harper, my family's moving.

14:21.061 --> 14:21.995
What?

14:22.862 --> 14:23.897
We're going back to Chicago.

14:24.932 --> 14:26.466
But that's crazy.
You literally just got here.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.168
<i>Oh, you think</i>
I don't know that?

14:29.569 --> 14:31.038
<i>Sorry, it's just--</i>

14:32.940 --> 14:34.807
My dad told my mom
that he lied,

14:34.942 --> 14:36.543
that he did know Savannah
as a kid.

14:37.477 --> 14:38.711
<i>Oh.</i>

14:38.845 --> 14:40.580
<i>They had</i>
this huge fight last night,

14:40.713 --> 14:42.315
<i>and my dad left,</i>

14:42.449 --> 14:44.117
<i>and he hasn't come back yet.</i>

14:44.251 --> 14:45.818
So as soon as he does,

14:46.486 --> 14:47.921
we're moving.

14:48.055 --> 14:48.888
Forever.

14:49.789 --> 14:51.091
This is so messed up.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.127
-Yeah, tell me about it.
Griffin!

14:54.962 --> 14:57.297
<i>We need more boxes</i>
from the garage.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.198
Griffin.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.133
<i>-I--I gotta go.</i>
-Wait.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.947
Sarah, hi.
Listen, I'm a little--

15:14.081 --> 15:15.148
Is Ben with you?

15:16.283 --> 15:17.985
-Excuse me?
-Ben.

15:18.651 --> 15:19.686
Is he there?

15:19.819 --> 15:21.721
No. Why would he be?

15:21.854 --> 15:22.922
<i>You're friends.</i>

15:23.923 --> 15:25.458
Were friends.

15:27.094 --> 15:28.461
And, uh...

15:29.462 --> 15:31.264
you seem to know
a lot about each other.

15:33.700 --> 15:36.103
What's wrong, Sarah?
You can't find him?

15:38.638 --> 15:41.108
Um... No.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.076
<i>Look, I'm-- I'm sorry</i>
I bothered you.

15:43.210 --> 15:44.044
Wait.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.479
There is a place.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.148
<i>It's a long shot,</i>

15:48.281 --> 15:49.649
but it's somewhere
he used to go.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.191
Why aren't
you guys packing?

15:58.325 --> 16:00.360
We're on strike.
We don't want to move.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.262
Chicago will seem boring now.

16:02.395 --> 16:03.763
No ghosts.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.499
Thought you guys
were scared of ghosts.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.801
We were, but now
we're kind of
into hunting them.

16:08.935 --> 16:10.603
You know Mom thinks
she saw one.

16:10.737 --> 16:11.671
And we heard the singing.

16:11.804 --> 16:12.705
What--

16:13.540 --> 16:14.941
What singing?

16:15.075 --> 16:16.176
The girl on the tape.

16:16.776 --> 16:17.810
In the boarded-up room?

16:18.978 --> 16:20.680
That's impossible.
Are you sure?

16:20.813 --> 16:22.415
Yeah, freaked out Dad too.

16:22.549 --> 16:24.751
Maybe that's why
we're moving.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.021
Hey.

16:33.426 --> 16:34.561
We should go.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.929
The lovebirds probably
need some alone time.

16:37.630 --> 16:38.498
To do what?

16:39.532 --> 16:40.667
Oh.

16:45.072 --> 16:46.306
Wow.

16:46.439 --> 16:47.807
So this
is really happening.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.942
Yup.

16:50.077 --> 16:52.245
My mom wants us to leave
as soon as we're packed.

16:53.246 --> 16:54.847
See, all this stuff
with our parents

16:54.981 --> 16:55.648
is just...

16:56.549 --> 16:57.917
Last night,
I couldn't stop thinking,

16:58.051 --> 16:59.319
if we could just
find Savannah...

16:59.452 --> 17:00.487
You could stay.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.055
Yeah.

17:02.189 --> 17:04.324
Okay, so we've got
a few minutes.

17:04.457 --> 17:06.659
Maybe there's something
we're missing.

17:06.793 --> 17:09.562
Like what?
Savannah's in 1962,

17:09.696 --> 17:12.699
and the portal
only takes us back
30 years at a time, so...

17:13.866 --> 17:15.802
Unless you want
to go back to 1960
and wait two years--

17:15.935 --> 17:17.470
Of course not, but...

17:17.604 --> 17:19.472
maybe there's a way
to control it.

17:19.606 --> 17:21.608
And as long as she's alive,
there's hope, right?

17:22.809 --> 17:24.043
What?

17:25.112 --> 17:25.978
The thing is...

17:26.679 --> 17:28.248
if Savannah was alive,

17:28.381 --> 17:29.682
she wouldn't be a ghost.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.818
She wouldn't still be
haunting The Tremont,

17:31.951 --> 17:33.420
but... she is.

17:33.553 --> 17:34.754
She is?

17:35.488 --> 17:36.423
How do you know?

17:36.556 --> 17:37.957
There's something
I need to show you.

17:38.091 --> 17:39.392
Come on.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.335
Get any sleep last night?

17:52.339 --> 17:53.273
Not much.

17:54.141 --> 17:55.108
Me neither.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.480
I'm sorry
I walked out like that.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.594
I love you.

18:16.129 --> 18:17.964
And you can
tell me anything.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.475
We were in camp here together.

18:30.643 --> 18:31.944
Me, Jess, and Savannah.

18:33.413 --> 18:35.648
Back then around the campfire,
the scariest ghost stories

18:35.782 --> 18:37.350
were about the basement
in the hotel.

18:40.853 --> 18:42.389
So one night...

18:43.723 --> 18:45.792
Jess dared Savannah
to stay down there...

18:45.925 --> 18:47.360
till morning.

18:50.397 --> 18:52.031
I thought I'd convinced her...

18:53.065 --> 18:54.133
not to do it.

18:55.935 --> 18:56.936
We camped out...

18:58.338 --> 18:59.239
up there.

19:00.039 --> 19:01.408
The tree house.

19:09.282 --> 19:10.750
But after I fell asleep...

19:14.554 --> 19:15.388
she snuck out.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.359
-To go to the basement?
-Yeah.

19:27.099 --> 19:29.202
<i>-So I did too.</i>
-Ben.

19:29.336 --> 19:31.771
It was dark and creepy,

19:32.505 --> 19:34.073
<i>but we told each other jokes</i>

19:34.207 --> 19:36.175
<i>and tried to laugh</i>
our way through it.

19:37.244 --> 19:39.712
<i>We were fine</i>
until we heard a noise.

19:41.047 --> 19:42.582
<i>It was all around us.</i>

19:43.216 --> 19:44.217
<i>I took off.</i>

19:46.753 --> 19:49.289
<i>I thought she followed,</i>
but she didn't.

19:50.257 --> 19:51.258
<i>She stayed.</i>

19:55.895 --> 19:57.364
And I didn't know...

19:59.499 --> 20:00.700
till the next morning.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.069
The police were there.

20:04.103 --> 20:05.238
Search parties.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.678
Kind of like today.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.149
You were just a kid.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.521
The only kid
who could have
saved her life.

20:28.861 --> 20:30.730
Griff was right.

20:31.798 --> 20:34.467
He said I came here
to make bad memories better.

20:36.669 --> 20:37.737
But the truth is I can't...

20:37.870 --> 20:39.639
and never will.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.543
Savannah is gone

20:43.676 --> 20:45.412
'cause I ran away.

20:49.115 --> 20:50.950
So this is where
the singing came from,

20:52.151 --> 20:53.686
an unplugged tape machine.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.789
Yesterday,
which means...

20:57.457 --> 20:58.658
She's still a ghost.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.363
Did you hear that?

21:03.496 --> 21:05.131
It looks like
the radio in the bunker.

21:17.310 --> 21:18.645
Whatever this is,

21:18.778 --> 21:19.946
it doesn't look
like it belongs.

21:24.584 --> 21:26.653
-No, won't budge.
-Let me try.

21:36.228 --> 21:38.331
-A code?
-Maybe.

21:38.465 --> 21:40.767
Or a combination.

21:41.901 --> 21:43.336
Let's find out.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.782
There has to be
a screwdriver here.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.022
-Here.
-Thank you.

22:09.429 --> 22:09.996
Bingo.

22:11.263 --> 22:13.700
Go ahead. Dial it
to the same numbers
from the one upstairs.

22:13.833 --> 22:14.867
Me?

22:15.001 --> 22:17.036
Yeah. It seems
to respond to you.

22:37.390 --> 22:39.225
-This is really weird.
-Yeah, no kidding.

22:40.159 --> 22:41.894
What do you think
it wants us to do?

22:42.028 --> 22:44.063
First of all,
I don't think it's an "it."

22:44.731 --> 22:46.799
It's her.
It's Savannah.

22:46.933 --> 22:48.535
And she's trying
to help us find her.

22:52.672 --> 22:55.007
<i>Next time on "Secrets</i>
of Sulphur Springs"...

22:55.141 --> 22:57.076
Maybe this little dial...
Choose any year.

22:57.209 --> 22:58.244
Try 1962.

22:58.377 --> 22:59.946
<i>That picture</i>
I found of Savannah,

23:00.079 --> 23:01.113
<i>that's the year it was taken.</i>

23:01.247 --> 23:02.749
What if something
goes wrong again?

23:02.882 --> 23:04.651
<i>I can be stuck there forever.</i>

23:04.784 --> 23:06.052
This is crazy.

23:06.185 --> 23:08.054
A wall of cold spots
and now...

23:08.621 --> 23:09.589
No. No frost.

23:10.557 --> 23:11.924
You don't think
Savannah's hiding, do you?

23:12.859 --> 23:14.260
What if she finally got
what she wanted?

23:14.393 --> 23:16.128
Mr. Campbell,
you have to come quick.

23:16.262 --> 23:17.664
-What's wrong?
-It's Griffin.

23:17.797 --> 23:19.098
He fell.
