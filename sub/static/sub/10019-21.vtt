00:14.651 --> 00:16.756
Is Dr. Benton done
with that thyroidectomy?

00:17.020 --> 00:18.513
So he's still in there?

00:26.329 --> 00:28.434
- Dr. Benton.
- Carter, what are you doing here?

00:28.697 --> 00:31.282
Let's get an ABG in 20 minutes.
I thought you were covering the ER.

00:31.544 --> 00:33.006
I'm on in a few.
We need to talk.

00:33.273 --> 00:37.527
Make it fast. I've got two
admissions, a clinic and an aneurysm.

00:38.967 --> 00:41.106
I've been thinking about
that kidney case...

00:41.368 --> 00:44.116
...when I left to check on the
patients during the debriefing.

00:44.406 --> 00:47.700
Instead of listening to two of the
finest surgeons in the country?

00:47.926 --> 00:49.170
I guess so.

00:50.389 --> 00:54.382
And I've just been wondering.
Maybe I'm in the wrong place.

00:54.612 --> 00:56.717
If you're still here
in two minutes, you are.

00:56.981 --> 01:00.592
I mean surgery. Obviously, I love it,
and I feel challenged by it.

01:00.852 --> 01:02.891
But are you ever not quite satisfied?

01:03.155 --> 01:05.577
Carter, sometimes the patient dies.

01:05.842 --> 01:07.566
- I know. But otherwise.
- Otherwise what?

01:07.827 --> 01:11.917
Well, it just feels like sometimes
they exist for us to do procedures.

01:12.209 --> 01:12.940
That's why they're here.

01:13.201 --> 01:15.787
We don't need to know anything about
them? Like how worried they are...

01:16.049 --> 01:20.653
...or where they went to high school
or whether they like cats or dogs?

01:21.200 --> 01:22.924
What are you talking about?

01:23.185 --> 01:24.744
I like to know the other stuff.

01:24.975 --> 01:26.601
What for? I mean, if you...

01:26.863 --> 01:27.845
Damn!

01:28.111 --> 01:30.827
Listen, we'll talk later.

01:32.495 --> 01:34.983
It was at least 50 questions
about my family background.

01:35.246 --> 01:37.449
Nothing like the head of Security
to make you feel insecure.

01:37.709 --> 01:42.148
He almost withheld my ID because I
didn't know my stepmom's maiden name.

01:42.412 --> 01:44.387
He didn't cut you slack
on that picture either.

01:44.652 --> 01:46.725
You'd think I was trying to enter
the White House.

01:47.020 --> 01:48.645
Which is easier. I've done it.

01:48.908 --> 01:51.395
- Can you get these over to Radiology?
- Now?

01:51.659 --> 01:54.920
Unless you're doing something urgent
that I can't quite see. Go.

01:55.146 --> 01:56.575
Dr. Ross, Pedes called.

01:56.843 --> 01:59.776
You're covering deliveries
for John Lavagnino. Broken kneecap.

02:00.041 --> 02:01.863
All right.
Good morning to you.

02:02.121 --> 02:04.871
Not for Anna. She just had her
security clearance interview.

02:05.130 --> 02:07.617
Did you get strip-searched?
Checked for track marks?

02:07.880 --> 02:08.610
Practically.

02:08.872 --> 02:11.011
They're cracking down
because of what happened to Mark.

02:11.272 --> 02:13.410
- He starts back today?
- I wish he'd take another week.

02:13.704 --> 02:16.671
Let's make sure we keep his load
light for the first few days.

02:16.903 --> 02:20.928
I want him helping me plan Carol's
surprise birthday party.

02:21.222 --> 02:22.433
- Doug!
- Happy birthday, Carol.

02:22.694 --> 02:24.963
I got vomiting and diarrhea in 4.
Happy birthday.

02:25.222 --> 02:28.451
And I'm taking the quadruple
bounce-back migraine in 5.

02:28.645 --> 02:30.979
Nothing like a little drug-seeking
behavior to start your day.

02:31.268 --> 02:32.894
You promised you wouldn't tell
anybody about my birthday.

02:33.157 --> 02:35.578
- That was last year.
- You told everybody then too.

02:35.844 --> 02:37.185
At least I'm consistent.

02:40.067 --> 02:41.594
All right, coffee...

02:41.890 --> 02:42.752
...can wait.

02:47.617 --> 02:48.544
What's this?

02:49.057 --> 02:50.813
It's a coffeepot.

02:51.489 --> 02:52.864
That is not a coffeepot.

02:53.153 --> 02:56.448
- It's called a French press.
- No more aluminum percolator?

02:56.705 --> 02:59.225
We're gonna have great coffee.
Which can wait.

03:01.504 --> 03:03.194
- What's that?
- The microwave.

03:03.455 --> 03:06.204
- I'm heating up some cinnamon buns.
- The microwave.

03:08.446 --> 03:10.780
- I always wanted a microwave.
- I know.

03:11.422 --> 03:15.131
You wouldn't let me get one.
You said it broke down the vitamins.

03:15.421 --> 03:18.170
I know. I'm sorry. I was wrong.
Come back over here.

03:18.429 --> 03:19.509
This is nice.

03:20.028 --> 03:22.330
I mean, this is really nice.

03:23.676 --> 03:26.393
- What happened?
- It's getting close, 9 centimeters.

03:26.651 --> 03:28.080
- I'm all right.
- She failed tocolysis.

03:28.347 --> 03:31.248
Her contractions are strong.
They went from 4 to 9 in no time.

03:31.515 --> 03:32.595
Why didn't you call me?

03:32.827 --> 03:34.998
Last time they gave me that stuff,
and it was fine.

03:35.258 --> 03:37.526
- Couldn't you have done something else?
- This baby's coming.

03:37.785 --> 03:39.345
It's coming?
Two months early?

03:39.609 --> 03:42.128
- I know that.
- You should've called me.

03:42.392 --> 03:45.556
I just did, hoping you'd want
to participate in the birth.

03:45.816 --> 03:49.164
If that's what you'd like to do,
I suggest you gown up.

04:56.044 --> 04:58.946
- Dr. Greene, right? How are you?
- I'm fine, thank you. Who are you?

04:59.213 --> 05:01.383
Anna Del Amico. We met last week.

05:01.675 --> 05:04.774
We didn't actually meet.
I was there when you were attacked.

05:05.003 --> 05:07.555
- In the men's room?
- In the Trauma Room afterwards.

05:07.818 --> 05:10.535
I don't remember either room,
so I don't remember you either.

05:10.762 --> 05:12.223
I start my Emergency Residency
in July.

05:12.521 --> 05:15.750
I'm doing ER Pedes until then.
That was my first day.

05:16.009 --> 05:18.048
I'm sorry it had to be so exciting.

05:18.312 --> 05:20.962
I'm just glad you're okay.
So welcome back.

05:21.224 --> 05:22.369
Thank you.

05:22.632 --> 05:23.841
Where is everybody?

05:24.103 --> 05:26.689
- What you doing here?
- Getting back to work.

05:26.951 --> 05:28.925
Doug and Carol are bringing in an MVA.

05:34.310 --> 05:36.349
- Hey, how are you doing?
- Welcome back.

05:36.581 --> 05:38.108
Nice to be back.
What do we got?

05:38.405 --> 05:40.510
- Bicycle versus tour bus.
- Don't worry. We got it.

05:40.742 --> 05:42.977
Just take it easy.
Settle in. Nice and easy.

05:43.236 --> 05:43.967
Here we go!

05:44.228 --> 05:47.294
Dr. Greene! You look great.
OB needs you for that delivery.

05:47.556 --> 05:50.904
Find Dr. Del Amico. See if she
can take it. I'll talk to you later.

05:52.323 --> 05:53.849
- She's at the desk.
- Who?

05:54.146 --> 05:56.797
- Dr. Del Amico. She's at the desk.
- Oh, right. Thanks.

05:58.338 --> 06:00.224
- Help me shift her down.
- Breathe, Carla.

06:00.481 --> 06:01.976
Come on, baby.
You can do it.

06:02.241 --> 06:04.248
- How much mag you give her?
- Six grams.

06:04.513 --> 06:07.512
I gave three an hour until
she hit 4 centimeters.

06:07.808 --> 06:08.888
Dorgan, scalp electrode.

06:09.120 --> 06:11.062
Keep breathing.
You're doing great.

06:11.328 --> 06:13.116
Dorgan? What kind of name is that?

06:13.376 --> 06:14.521
Irish, through and through.

06:14.783 --> 06:16.606
We've experience
having a lot of babies.

06:17.119 --> 06:18.940
Is she at risk for chorioamnionitis?

06:19.487 --> 06:20.435
Come on, breathe!

06:20.702 --> 06:22.524
Don't yell at me, damn it!

06:23.038 --> 06:25.786
- You give her antenatal steroids?
- Twelve milligrams betamethasone.

06:26.045 --> 06:27.638
And her blood sugar?
She's got gestational diabetes.

06:27.901 --> 06:29.624
You're doing great.
Hang in there.

06:29.884 --> 06:31.859
Not much longer.
You'll be able to push soon.

06:32.124 --> 06:34.906
What about a second dose?
This baby's gonna have RDS!

06:36.347 --> 06:37.525
What is RDS?

06:37.755 --> 06:40.886
It's okay. It just means the baby's
lungs haven't matured yet.

06:41.339 --> 06:42.647
- What?
- It's okay.

06:44.602 --> 06:47.319
Hold her hand! Help her breathe!
Help her focus!

06:47.577 --> 06:49.235
That's your only job here.

06:49.497 --> 06:52.082
Get over there and help
the mother of your child.

06:52.345 --> 06:54.548
There'll be two additional
security cameras here.

06:54.808 --> 06:56.596
- And two at the employees' entrance.
- Right.

06:56.856 --> 07:00.052
The ambulance-bay doors will be
changed to bulletproof glass...

07:00.343 --> 07:02.318
...which we'll also add
to Triage.

07:02.551 --> 07:05.486
The hospital agreed to additional
armed security in your waiting room.

07:05.750 --> 07:07.855
And the bathrooms?
Any cameras in there?

07:08.150 --> 07:10.386
Unfortunately, privacy issues
won't allow us to do that.

07:10.614 --> 07:13.263
My assailant's privacy would've
definitely been violated.

07:13.525 --> 07:15.052
We can only do what we can do.

07:15.317 --> 07:16.429
Thank you, Mr. Biggers.

07:16.693 --> 07:18.896
It's nice to see you,
but what are you doing here?

07:19.156 --> 07:21.806
Working.
It's nice to see you too, Chuny.

07:22.068 --> 07:25.515
These additional security measures
may not help, but they can't hurt.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.146
Everyone's overreacting.
What we should change...

07:28.403 --> 07:30.606
...is the way we deal with patients
and their families.

07:30.898 --> 07:34.193
- They're a pain in the ass.
- Your compassion knows no bounds.

07:34.418 --> 07:36.140
Detective Warrington called.

07:36.401 --> 07:38.572
Can't make it by till
later this afternoon.

07:39.057 --> 07:41.576
You think a patient or
family member did this?

07:41.872 --> 07:44.742
I think that gives them a good reason.
Look. Louise Pierson.

07:44.976 --> 07:48.204
Ankle x-ray. Three hours ago.
Where is it?

07:48.463 --> 07:50.884
Discharge orders written
almost 2 hours ago.

07:51.151 --> 07:52.973
Chart's still here,
so the guy's still here.

07:53.231 --> 07:57.060
Come on! Med-Surg admission,
5:30 this morning. Still here.

07:57.326 --> 08:00.009
Neuro consult,
ETA 7:15 this morning.

08:00.429 --> 08:02.534
Where are they?
We keep these people hanging around.

08:02.797 --> 08:04.903
I'd get pissed off enough
to clobber somebody.

08:05.165 --> 08:08.841
Before Records clobbers me,
I need you to sign off these charts.

08:10.444 --> 08:11.371
I got them.

08:13.739 --> 08:14.786
I'm fine.

08:17.387 --> 08:20.070
- Push! You're almost there!
- Come on. Keep going.

08:20.298 --> 08:22.054
- I'm Del Amico from Pedes.
- Janet Coburn.

08:22.314 --> 08:25.313
- I thought Ross was covering.
- He's got a teenager MVA.

08:25.577 --> 08:27.585
This is Carla Reece: Mother.
Peter Benton: Father.

08:27.849 --> 08:31.110
Hi. Just keep pushing so I
can take a look at your baby.

08:31.496 --> 08:33.982
- Mr. Benton, how are you doing?
- It's Dr. Benton, Surgical Resident.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.548
- You're new here?
- Yes, from Children's in Philadelphia.

08:36.775 --> 08:38.203
- Are you a Resident?
- Correct.

08:38.471 --> 08:40.707
How many deliveries did
you attend over there?

08:41.159 --> 08:44.420
I stopped counting around 200.
We've got a late decel here.

08:44.646 --> 08:46.369
- Carla's at 32 weeks.
- Any meconium?

08:46.662 --> 08:48.090
- Fluid's clear.
- Heart rate's dropping.

08:48.325 --> 08:50.081
- Where's the NICU nurse?
- On her way.

08:50.341 --> 08:52.163
- Down to 120.
- Why isn't he coming?

08:52.453 --> 08:55.300
- He's coming, baby.
- Let's get this baby out of here.

08:55.556 --> 08:58.174
- I need vacuum extraction.
- Why vacuum extraction?

08:58.436 --> 09:00.442
- We're at 100 here.
- That's why.

09:00.707 --> 09:03.641
- Number for Respiratory Therapy?
- Three-three-nine-four.

09:04.579 --> 09:08.572
I brought some stuff in today
because I knew you'd be starting back.

09:09.474 --> 09:10.238
What are you doing?

09:10.498 --> 09:12.863
I know you'll be
a little resistant to this...

09:13.121 --> 09:15.903
...but you'll feel safer if you
carry something on you.

09:17.696 --> 09:18.743
What is this stuff?

09:18.976 --> 09:21.245
I've got cops in my family,
so I can get anything.

09:21.536 --> 09:23.957
Electronic stun gun, personal taser.

09:24.415 --> 09:26.968
- I don't think so.
- At least take the pepper spray.

09:27.231 --> 09:30.491
I appreciate it, really,
but it's not for me.

09:30.749 --> 09:34.295
I'm not suggesting you pack a gun,
although that's what I do.

09:34.589 --> 09:36.825
- You carry a gun?
- Under the front seat of my car.

09:37.053 --> 09:39.126
I was at the drive-in once,
waiting for fries...

09:39.485 --> 09:42.780
...and this punk sticks a knife
in my face. He wants my wallet.

09:43.100 --> 09:45.336
So I reach under the seat,
grab the.357...

09:45.596 --> 09:48.050
...stick it up his nose,
and could that kid run!

09:48.347 --> 09:50.768
- Dr. Greene, welcome back.
- Thanks.

09:51.035 --> 09:53.620
Listen, thanks, Maggie,
but I'll pass on the armaments.

09:53.882 --> 09:56.948
Are you in the ER all day?
Because I'll need your help.

09:57.178 --> 09:59.697
I don't have full mobility yet
for procedures.

09:59.961 --> 10:03.441
- What is all this stuff?
- I was trying to get Dr. Greene to...

10:04.825 --> 10:05.806
- Oh, my God!
- Sit down!

10:06.072 --> 10:07.730
Oh, my God! Maggie, help me!

10:07.992 --> 10:09.934
Just sit! Just sit!
I'll get a nurse!

10:10.232 --> 10:12.882
I'll be right back. Don't move.
Don't touch your eyes.

10:14.007 --> 10:15.600
That's it. Push! Push!

10:16.055 --> 10:18.127
- Come on. Breathe.
- We got him!

10:19.414 --> 10:20.821
It's okay, baby.
It's okay.

10:21.110 --> 10:22.354
Blue and floppy.

10:22.614 --> 10:23.474
Ready the liter.

10:27.413 --> 10:29.517
What is it? I can't hear him.

10:29.844 --> 10:32.113
- What's going on? What's wrong?
- DeLee suction.

10:32.372 --> 10:35.056
- Please tell me what's going on.
- I don't like his color.

10:37.139 --> 10:39.440
Come on, little guy.
Pick up for us. Let's go.

10:39.699 --> 10:41.967
- What's the Apgar?
- Zero for color.

10:42.226 --> 10:44.015
Peter, back off! Let her work!

10:44.274 --> 10:46.248
Muscle tone, zero. One for reflex.

10:46.546 --> 10:47.690
Two for heart rate.

10:47.953 --> 10:49.775
One-minute Apgar, 4 out of 10.

10:50.064 --> 10:51.690
You gotta do something!
Let's go!

10:51.953 --> 10:53.382
Tell me what's going on.

10:54.384 --> 10:57.450
It's okay, baby. It's okay.
They got him.

10:57.743 --> 11:00.328
- He's got retractions.
- I need to tube him.

11:00.591 --> 11:01.539
Two-point-five.

11:03.150 --> 11:04.874
Heart rate down. Eighty-five.

11:05.677 --> 11:07.750
Start compressions.
Draw.02 epi.

11:08.014 --> 11:10.152
Call the NICU.
Tell them we're on the way.

11:25.707 --> 11:26.951
I'm sorry.

11:28.810 --> 11:31.231
- I know it's not funny, but...
- No, it's funny.

11:31.593 --> 11:34.343
My whole life is just
one big funfest.

11:34.794 --> 11:38.470
Anspaugh hates me, Benton looks at me
like I'm some kind of an alien.

11:38.729 --> 11:40.485
Those things are in your favor.

11:40.745 --> 11:41.921
Right. Thank you.

11:42.407 --> 11:44.230
When you were thinking
about med school...

11:44.520 --> 11:46.692
...you were willing to start over?
All that work?

11:47.272 --> 11:50.467
As opposed to the 6 more years
of Surgical Residency ahead of you?

11:50.759 --> 11:51.936
I see your point.

11:52.839 --> 11:55.074
- You back among the living?
- Absolutely.

11:55.302 --> 11:57.855
We've got an MVA coming in
six or seven minutes.

12:00.421 --> 12:03.290
It's not my place to say,
but he looks kind of bad.

12:05.860 --> 12:09.340
You okay there? I'm just going
to get everything ready for you.

12:09.604 --> 12:10.880
Be right back.

12:11.332 --> 12:14.048
Just hang in there.
You're almost there.

12:18.529 --> 12:21.279
What are we gonna do?
Have you seen him?

12:21.857 --> 12:25.118
I'll check on him as soon as
you're settled. Just take it easy.

12:27.841 --> 12:30.873
Just be a couple of more minutes.
Housekeeping hasn't finished.

12:51.069 --> 12:52.475
One, two, three.

12:54.235 --> 12:54.966
Rib?

12:55.228 --> 12:56.657
- We'll kick you out.
- I'm fine.

12:56.923 --> 13:00.719
Normal vital signs. Oxygen, 5 liters.
GCS, 11. Mind if I steal some saline?

13:00.987 --> 13:01.718
Help yourself.

13:01.979 --> 13:04.248
Pupils are equal and reactive.
No hemotympanum.

13:04.475 --> 13:06.678
Chest is clear.
Abdomen soft and flat.

13:06.969 --> 13:08.791
Pulse is 80. BP, 120 over 75.

13:09.049 --> 13:10.424
- What's his name?
- Harry Smith.

13:10.682 --> 13:12.623
Harry, can you hear me?
Do you know where you are?

13:12.888 --> 13:16.434
- Let's order something.
- CBC, Chem-7, type and screen.

13:16.697 --> 13:19.184
- You want to dip a urine?
- Get a C-spine, chest and pelvis.

13:19.447 --> 13:20.691
Police said it was a DUI?

13:20.984 --> 13:24.627
He was swerving on the Eisenhower,
going 35. He hit a light pole.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.920
- Get a blood alcohol level.
- No alcohol on his breath.

13:28.151 --> 13:29.393
Thanks for the supplies.

13:29.686 --> 13:30.515
Anytime!

13:31.094 --> 13:32.021
He's seizing!

13:34.005 --> 13:35.760
Get some Ativan, 2 mgs.

14:12.623 --> 14:13.484
Where's Tabash?

14:14.127 --> 14:16.036
He's with another patient.

14:16.367 --> 14:18.253
- What's he ordered?
- Everything.

14:18.798 --> 14:20.838
CBC, lytes, blood cultures, what?

14:21.102 --> 14:23.370
- Yes. All that.
- ABG, chest x-ray?

14:23.629 --> 14:24.938
- Yes.
- Dr. Benton.

14:26.829 --> 14:29.446
Your son is stable at the moment.

14:29.708 --> 14:31.137
What labs have you ordered?

14:31.595 --> 14:33.351
We've done a complete septic workup.

14:33.771 --> 14:36.007
I need to know exactly
what you've ordered.

14:36.234 --> 14:38.056
What labs, what antibiotics, what...

14:38.314 --> 14:41.097
Dr. Benton, your son's
heart rate is 170...

14:41.418 --> 14:44.069
...and his pulse ox is 91
on 100 percent oxygen.

14:44.842 --> 14:48.070
We've taken a chest x-ray,
drawn blood for CBC, lytes and ABG...

14:48.329 --> 14:51.590
...sent off blood, urine,
endotracheal aspirate and...

14:51.848 --> 14:55.971
...spinal-fluid cultures and started
him on 100 milligrams of ampicillin...

14:56.232 --> 14:58.654
...and 6 milligrams of gentamicin.

14:58.919 --> 15:01.187
He was hypotensive with
a blood pressure of 30/18...

15:01.446 --> 15:05.243
...so he's received 5 percent
albumin, 10 cc's per kilo.

15:05.541 --> 15:08.323
And we've started dopamine,
5 mcgs per kilo per minute.

15:08.581 --> 15:10.851
And we'll titrate to a M.A.P. Of 40.

15:12.741 --> 15:15.010
Now, what you need to know.

15:15.365 --> 15:18.364
What you need to share
with this child's mother...

15:18.627 --> 15:22.424
...is that at the moment, the baby
is stable but critically ill.

15:22.692 --> 15:24.698
Probably has a serious infection
in his blood.

15:24.963 --> 15:28.345
We don't know if his lungs can
provide enough oxygen to sustain life.

15:28.611 --> 15:31.741
Unfortunately, we have no choice
but to wait and see how he responds...

15:32.002 --> 15:33.693
...to the present therapy.

15:34.370 --> 15:38.646
Let's see how he's doing in an hour.
And that's when we should talk again.

15:40.769 --> 15:43.069
What's your son's name?

15:47.711 --> 15:48.889
He doesn't have one.

15:54.622 --> 15:57.011
All right, I got some good news
and bad news.

15:57.277 --> 15:58.619
You're gonna tell me both.

15:58.878 --> 16:02.968
The bad news is, they're planning a
surprise birthday party for you.

16:03.228 --> 16:06.805
- You did this joke on me this morning.
- This one's real. I got invited.

16:07.100 --> 16:07.961
I'm not listening.

16:08.220 --> 16:12.048
The good news is, I know you hate your
birthday, so I got you out of it.

16:12.315 --> 16:14.006
I do not hate my birthday.

16:14.267 --> 16:16.438
So I told them you cannot make it...

16:16.730 --> 16:18.834
...because you're having
dinner with me.

16:19.066 --> 16:20.888
I do not believe a word of this.

16:21.146 --> 16:23.317
How many people have wished you
happy birthday?

16:23.577 --> 16:24.689
Just Kerry, this morning.

16:24.952 --> 16:27.952
And how many people know
that it is your birthday?

16:28.217 --> 16:30.867
- You know theirs, right?
- We've worked together for years.

16:31.127 --> 16:34.804
What is the one reason why you don't
wish someone happy birthday...

16:35.063 --> 16:36.589
...when it is their birthday?

16:36.855 --> 16:40.302
- They're planning a surprise party.
- That's all I'm saying.

16:40.599 --> 16:42.485
Why do I feel you've
trapped me into this?

16:42.837 --> 16:46.285
Trapped you? I saved you.
You should be buying me dinner.

16:47.285 --> 16:49.619
I'll pick you up anytime.
You name the place and...

16:50.516 --> 16:52.077
You got some gauze out here.

16:52.756 --> 16:54.730
I'm out of here as of an hour ago.

16:54.996 --> 16:58.062
Can you send that Carla Reece
chart up to OB, please?

16:58.324 --> 17:00.297
- Sure. I got it.
- Did you say Carla Reece?

17:00.562 --> 17:02.471
She just delivered her baby.

17:02.738 --> 17:04.265
- Carla?
- You know her?

17:04.753 --> 17:08.330
Not really. I remember her.
She came through the ER a month ago.

17:08.593 --> 17:09.967
She wasn't near being due.

17:10.258 --> 17:12.428
I know. The baby's only 32 weeks.
A little boy.

17:13.008 --> 17:14.502
- Was he okay?
- I don't know.

17:14.737 --> 17:18.729
He's in the NICU. Apgar was poor.
Had to intubate. It's touch-and-go.

17:19.022 --> 17:20.201
Is she doing all right?

17:20.431 --> 17:22.952
She had no other complications,
if that's what you mean.

17:23.184 --> 17:25.452
I don't know how many preemies
I've resuscitated...

17:25.742 --> 17:27.750
...but I'm still not used to it.
See you tomorrow.

17:28.013 --> 17:28.876
See you.

17:30.733 --> 17:33.155
Is Maggie taking that woman
with the eye pain?

17:33.421 --> 17:35.460
No, I'm taking her.
I'm just heading in.

17:35.724 --> 17:39.979
Don't keep the patients waiting.
Dr. Greene's on a rampage about that.

17:40.236 --> 17:43.170
He'll settle back in.
He just needs a couple more days.

17:45.547 --> 17:48.962
- I keep missing you. How you doing?
- I'm fine. Feels good to be back.

17:49.195 --> 17:52.642
- Not too soon?
- It was nice having time with Rachel.

17:52.906 --> 17:55.239
But a week at home is about
all I could take.

17:55.562 --> 17:59.107
- Any word from the police?
- They're gonna come by this afternoon.

17:59.368 --> 18:01.921
I gave them a list of patients
and family members...

18:02.185 --> 18:04.640
...who might have had a reason
to be that angry.

18:04.905 --> 18:06.430
The ones I could remember.

18:06.728 --> 18:09.095
- So you're okay with this?
- Yes and no.

18:09.735 --> 18:12.123
It hasn't been the most
pleasant experience...

18:12.422 --> 18:13.535
...but it's a wake-up call.

18:13.766 --> 18:17.889
A reminder that I can be abrupt
with people, and it'll backfire.

18:18.181 --> 18:19.196
I don't know if that's...

18:19.462 --> 18:21.633
You've got a five-year-old
with a wrist fracture.

18:21.861 --> 18:25.341
A child in pain. Music to my ears.
Get some lunch later?

18:39.586 --> 18:40.928
I'm so sorry.

18:44.641 --> 18:48.055
The chest x-ray showed a diffuse,
patchy infiltrate...

18:48.320 --> 18:50.873
...and the endotracheal aspirate...

18:52.064 --> 18:54.616
...showed gram-negative bacteria.

18:55.168 --> 18:57.917
He's got pneumonia, sepsis,
premature lungs...

18:58.239 --> 19:00.889
...Respiratory Distress Syndrome.

19:01.726 --> 19:05.686
They just gave him surfactant
to try to open up his lungs.

19:07.806 --> 19:08.853
How's Carla doing?

19:09.949 --> 19:12.250
She asked me to wait outside
in the hall.

19:15.997 --> 19:18.581
You probably haven't shared this
with anyone, have you?

19:19.611 --> 19:21.750
Your family, people you work with.

19:26.938 --> 19:28.247
You do have friends.

19:28.634 --> 19:29.877
A community.

19:33.209 --> 19:34.736
I hope everything will be all right.

19:44.280 --> 19:46.647
And you need to stop standing
in the hall.

19:58.293 --> 19:59.852
Just keep your hands at your sides.

20:00.116 --> 20:02.483
- It hurts!
- Yes, I think we know that.

20:02.708 --> 20:06.504
Pulse is 130. BP is 180 over 95.
Pre-op labs?

20:08.276 --> 20:10.381
You been taking a lot
of ibuprofen lately?

20:10.995 --> 20:12.489
About eight tablets a day.

20:13.266 --> 20:16.562
But that's because I twisted my knee,
not because of this stomachache.

20:17.138 --> 20:18.414
- You have a minute?
- Sure.

20:18.641 --> 20:22.219
Let's get an upright chest x-ray
and give 10 of morphine slow IV push.

20:22.481 --> 20:24.782
That'll help with your pain.
I'll be right back.

20:25.936 --> 20:26.951
I'm just checking.

20:27.280 --> 20:31.337
This is the groaning guy in Exam 2
that Dr. Greene was concerned about?

20:31.631 --> 20:32.362
He's concerned?

20:32.624 --> 20:35.939
He's worried the guy's waiting
too long for a Surgical consult.

20:36.398 --> 20:40.457
Mr. Lensky's got a board-like abdomen
and guarding in all four quadrants.

20:40.718 --> 20:42.855
- A perfed ulcer?
- Sounds like it. I ordered a film.

20:43.117 --> 20:44.939
Have Anspaugh check it out.

20:45.933 --> 20:48.071
- Colles' fracture.
- Do a closed reduction?

20:48.332 --> 20:49.925
His dad still too flipped
out to watch?

20:50.188 --> 20:53.188
He's sacked out in Curtain 3,
having self-medicated with Valium.

20:53.483 --> 20:56.266
That's helpful. Maybe we should
get a lollipop for Russell.

20:56.555 --> 20:58.279
- Fentanyl Oralet?
- No. I'm out.

20:58.540 --> 21:00.513
I'll have to order it.
It may take a while.

21:00.746 --> 21:02.983
- We can try it without.
- All right.

21:03.274 --> 21:06.241
I tell you what we're gonna do, buddy.
We're gonna...

21:08.073 --> 21:09.983
- I'll get that lollipop.
- Get right on it.

21:10.345 --> 21:13.989
I want to give it a little longer,
but the surfactant didn't do much.

21:14.248 --> 21:18.470
He still requires 100 percent oxygen
with high pressures on the ventilator.

21:18.727 --> 21:22.437
His mother's gonna want to know
everything that might happen.

21:22.696 --> 21:26.011
Every parent in here
wants to know what might happen.

21:26.374 --> 21:28.130
We just can't know for sure.

21:29.605 --> 21:30.336
You know...

21:31.749 --> 21:33.789
...I did a Pedes Surgery elective
this year...

21:34.085 --> 21:37.346
...but I'm not up to speed
on all the sequelae.

21:38.244 --> 21:39.390
Like retinopathy?

21:39.621 --> 21:43.133
Exactly. Although, his eyesight
should be the least of our worries.

21:43.395 --> 21:46.624
We need to be more concerned
about intraventricular hemorrhage...

21:46.883 --> 21:49.566
...periventricular leukomalacia,
necrotizing enterocolitis...

21:49.826 --> 21:52.859
...and in a few weeks,
bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

21:53.122 --> 21:54.779
All right, what do we do?

21:55.426 --> 21:58.273
I'm concerned about the high vent
pressure's causing lung damage.

21:58.529 --> 22:03.001
So I want to switch him over to an
oscillating ventilator, and we wait.

22:07.999 --> 22:10.072
- Dr. Greene, you got a second?
- What is it?

22:10.336 --> 22:12.091
I got the head CT back
on Harry Smith.

22:12.351 --> 22:15.001
- Harry Smith?
- The MVA from this morning?

22:15.262 --> 22:18.742
It's negative. No bleed.
But I was talking to his mother.

22:19.326 --> 22:22.904
She said Harry was on his way to a
pre-employment physical for a new job.

22:23.166 --> 22:25.270
She also let it drop that she was...

22:25.564 --> 22:28.314
...relieved that the cops didn't
find marijuana on him.

22:28.573 --> 22:30.677
Is this leading to helping
the patient?

22:30.907 --> 22:33.328
His urine is like water.
Check this out.

22:33.819 --> 22:35.063
"Specific gravity, 10.05."

22:35.834 --> 22:38.103
I think we should give him Lasix
for hyponatremia.

22:38.394 --> 22:39.321
Water intoxication?

22:39.578 --> 22:41.400
If he's worried about
a urine drug test...

22:41.657 --> 22:44.439
...maybe he thinks he can dilute it
or wash out his system.

22:44.729 --> 22:46.933
Transfer that LOL back to
her nursing home.

22:47.192 --> 22:50.291
Did you hear from that
detective who said he was coming by?

22:50.552 --> 22:52.210
Haven't heard, haven't seen.

22:53.591 --> 22:54.998
That's a good thought.

22:55.287 --> 22:57.589
Call the lab and see
if his lytes are back.

23:00.278 --> 23:01.042
Does that hurt?

23:01.718 --> 23:03.540
That's why Dr. Ross
gave you that shot.

23:03.862 --> 23:06.643
Nurse Hathaway is gonna pull
down on your arm...

23:06.901 --> 23:10.960
...I'll push, and we'll pop that
bone right here right back in place.

23:11.188 --> 23:13.163
- Ready to start?
- Where's my dad?

23:16.180 --> 23:16.943
Taking a nap.

23:18.323 --> 23:21.291
But he wanted us to be here with you.

23:22.483 --> 23:23.659
He sings to me.

23:25.555 --> 23:27.147
He sings to you, does he?

23:27.922 --> 23:28.970
So you'll do it?

23:30.993 --> 23:33.775
I think Dr. Ross would love
to sing to you.

23:35.824 --> 23:38.573
You know, Nurse Hathaway
would like to join in...

23:39.088 --> 23:40.779
...but she doesn't know the words.

23:41.040 --> 23:43.079
I believe I do too know the words...

23:43.375 --> 23:46.125
...to whatever it is Dr. Ross
is gonna sing to you.

23:51.278 --> 23:53.100
<i>Hello, Muddah</i>
<i>Hello, Faddah</i>

23:55.949 --> 23:58.404
<i>Here I am at</i>
<i>Camp Grenada</i>

24:01.452 --> 24:04.234
<i>It is very entertaining</i>
Pop it right there.

24:04.492 --> 24:07.720
<i>And they say we'll have some fun</i>
<i>If it stops raining</i>

24:07.947 --> 24:08.808
Wrap that up.

24:09.419 --> 24:12.484
<i>I went hiking</i>
<i>With Joe Spivy</i>

24:12.714 --> 24:15.561
<i>He did develop</i>
<i>Poison ivy</i>

24:16.170 --> 24:19.748
- You brought me here for this?
- I think he perfed his stomach ulcer.

24:19.977 --> 24:21.886
Of course. It's free air
under the diaphragm.

24:22.153 --> 24:23.843
It's a slam dunk, no-brainer.

24:24.104 --> 24:27.749
All right, drop an NG, consent him
and redline him to the O.R.

24:31.047 --> 24:34.495
I realize you needed backup, but any
Senior Resident could've handled this.

24:35.015 --> 24:37.600
So please think twice next time.

24:42.725 --> 24:45.213
Good news. We'll be able
to fix you up right away.

24:45.445 --> 24:46.972
- What is it?
- You have an ulcer...

24:47.236 --> 24:49.059
...which has eaten through
the lining of your stomach...

24:49.380 --> 24:51.322
...but with surgery can be
easily repaired.

24:51.556 --> 24:52.384
Surgery?

24:52.644 --> 24:55.360
- It's a fairly routine procedure...
- I can't do surgery.

24:55.619 --> 24:58.554
- It really is the only option.
- No. I feel better already.

24:58.819 --> 25:01.818
That's the morphine.
Nothing's changed with your condition.

25:02.082 --> 25:04.417
- Wait a second. Listen to me.
- You listen to me!

25:05.505 --> 25:07.644
I will not have surgery!
And you can't make me!

25:07.905 --> 25:09.728
Now leave me alone. I wanna go.

25:10.497 --> 25:12.700
Can you tell me why
you feel so strongly?

25:14.016 --> 25:15.423
Did something happen to you?

25:16.128 --> 25:17.272
To somebody else?

25:21.535 --> 25:23.160
I'm trying to help you here.

25:23.838 --> 25:25.626
But I can't help you if you leave.

25:26.302 --> 25:28.603
Or if you won't
tell me what the problem is.

25:39.420 --> 25:41.459
Of all the stupid things.

25:42.939 --> 25:44.248
Gallbladder.

25:45.915 --> 25:48.085
My dad was such a believer...

25:48.346 --> 25:50.451
...in modern doctors,
modern medicines.

25:50.745 --> 25:53.494
"They'll pop this thing out.
I'll be home tomorrow."

25:54.553 --> 25:56.495
Fifty-eight years old, and he dies...

25:56.761 --> 25:59.149
...having his stupid
gallbladder taken out.

25:59.992 --> 26:01.202
And the surgeon.

26:02.040 --> 26:06.229
All he could talk about
was how simple it was, no big deal.

26:07.319 --> 26:11.028
Afterwards, he couldn't even
look my mother in the eye.

26:12.469 --> 26:15.568
He gave us the news and just
spouted some fancy medical words.

26:15.862 --> 26:19.374
All I could think was,
"You lying son of a bitch!"

26:23.764 --> 26:26.186
We shouldn't have believed him.

26:27.380 --> 26:28.841
How can I believe you?

26:33.843 --> 26:36.591
I talked to him about his father's
gallbladder operation.

26:36.817 --> 26:38.443
I explained why his surgery
was different.

26:38.737 --> 26:40.199
I couldn't get him to budge.

26:40.434 --> 26:41.742
Not much you can do.

26:42.001 --> 26:43.430
He needs to get to the O.R.

26:43.729 --> 26:47.373
Not to mention, Anspaugh's gonna
take my head off one more time.

26:47.664 --> 26:49.868
We can't override the consent
for emergency surgery.

26:50.096 --> 26:53.259
No, we can't. But I read a paper
about forme fruste...

26:53.551 --> 26:55.339
...ulcers that spontaneously seal off.

26:55.599 --> 26:57.738
Do a paper-chase search.
See what you find.

26:57.967 --> 27:00.454
Maybe a Hypaque upper GI,
see what's going on.

27:00.718 --> 27:01.645
Good idea.

27:02.989 --> 27:05.225
These labs came back for you
on Harry Smith.

27:05.741 --> 27:07.170
Sodium, 115?

27:07.885 --> 27:10.755
I don't believe it. I was right.
He's been drinking buckets of water.

27:11.180 --> 27:13.546
He's also waking up
if you want to talk to him.

27:14.476 --> 27:15.490
Where's Dr. Greene?

27:16.812 --> 27:17.826
Anything to drink?

27:18.123 --> 27:20.195
Sure. I'll take a pop
if you've got one.

27:21.003 --> 27:23.784
Good news. All the leads
you gave us came out clear.

27:24.074 --> 27:26.375
- What?
- Yeah. Everyone checked out.

27:27.082 --> 27:28.806
Patients? Families?

27:29.193 --> 27:30.403
Everyone you gave us.

27:31.784 --> 27:33.607
There wasn't anything on anyone?

27:34.537 --> 27:36.358
Usually people are glad
to hear that.

27:36.648 --> 27:38.917
They don't like things happening
in their own back yard.

27:40.520 --> 27:41.981
Right. Right.

27:44.006 --> 27:44.868
You okay?

27:45.671 --> 27:46.467
Sure.

27:48.550 --> 27:50.819
I see you made a pretty
quick recovery.

27:52.422 --> 27:55.039
It wasn't as bad as I thought
it was gonna be.

27:55.301 --> 27:57.570
We'll keep investigating, of course.

27:58.469 --> 27:59.296
Gotta go.

28:03.236 --> 28:04.730
- Dr. Greene.
- Later, Carter.

28:04.996 --> 28:07.166
I was right about the
water-intoxication guy.

28:07.427 --> 28:08.834
His sodium is 115.
He drank 3 gallons.

28:09.091 --> 28:13.214
That's great. Great. Terrific.
Wonderful. Admit to Medicine.

28:21.377 --> 28:23.318
It's not that it's a better
or a worse option.

28:23.552 --> 28:25.821
It just may be the only other thing
to consider.

28:26.112 --> 28:28.381
Babies can respond
to inhaled nitric oxide...

28:28.608 --> 28:30.996
...and it can improve
their oxygenation.

28:31.359 --> 28:32.788
In full-term babies.

28:33.503 --> 28:36.284
Correct. It's still being studied
in premature infants.

28:36.510 --> 28:39.357
We're participating
in a national multicenter trial.

28:39.933 --> 28:43.609
There is a small series which shows
that nitric improved oxygenation...

28:43.869 --> 28:45.462
...by 50 percent on average.

28:45.725 --> 28:48.790
Now, half of those kids did develop
bleeding of the brain...

28:49.116 --> 28:51.669
...but no one knows
if the gas caused that.

28:52.155 --> 28:53.463
Bleeding in the brain.

28:53.691 --> 28:56.887
There would be a risk of retardation
and cerebral palsy.

28:57.179 --> 29:01.368
But if we keep doing what we're doing
now, there's a risk of lung disease.

29:01.626 --> 29:06.131
Yes. And possible brain damage
if the oxygen level falls too low.

29:06.360 --> 29:08.564
That's a hell of a choice.
How do I make that decision?

29:09.017 --> 29:13.239
I wish I could answer that question
for every parent I talk to every day.

29:13.976 --> 29:15.951
Dr. Tabash?
I'm sorry.

29:16.184 --> 29:19.445
Talk it over with the baby's mother,
and let me know soon.

29:19.990 --> 29:20.918
Excuse me.

29:31.924 --> 29:34.291
I'm an idiot, Kerry.
I'm a complete idiot.

29:34.581 --> 29:36.620
Was that the detective
you were waiting for?

29:36.915 --> 29:40.745
It wasn't an angry patient. It wasn't
a family member of an angry patient.

29:41.011 --> 29:43.345
It wasn't Chris Law.
It wasn't Mr. Gunther.

29:43.571 --> 29:46.254
It wasn't that crazy guy
who was yelling about Krishna.

29:46.579 --> 29:48.203
They checked everybody out?

29:49.234 --> 29:53.194
I thought I was remembering it like
a puzzle that would come together.

29:53.488 --> 29:56.522
But the Chicago Police Department
was nice enough to inform me...

29:56.753 --> 29:59.054
...that I am simply the victim
of random violence.

29:59.343 --> 30:01.864
Well, you knew that,
patient or no patient.

30:03.280 --> 30:05.897
What I knew is that
everything I do...

30:06.159 --> 30:07.686
...I do because I am not
the victim.

30:07.951 --> 30:10.023
I treat the victim.
I cure the victim.

30:10.255 --> 30:12.142
I watch them roll the victim out
like a piece of meat.

30:12.366 --> 30:14.602
But the truth is,
I'm the piece of meat.

30:14.894 --> 30:19.301
We can't think about that. We're the
ones who see what goes on out there.

30:19.564 --> 30:23.906
We know that every day some
child won't make it home from school.

30:24.236 --> 30:26.276
Some father won't make it
home from work.

30:26.540 --> 30:29.441
But if we allowed ourselves
to think that could be us...

30:29.739 --> 30:31.332
...we couldn't walk out
our front door.

30:31.595 --> 30:33.188
The problem is, that is us.

30:34.699 --> 30:38.276
No, the problem is,
it makes us like everyone else.

30:58.823 --> 31:01.277
Dr. Anspaugh, I was just coming up
to see you.

31:01.926 --> 31:04.773
Where's that perfed ulcer?
He should've been out two hours ago.

31:05.028 --> 31:07.745
That's why I wanted to talk.
Mr. Lensky doesn't want surgery.

31:08.004 --> 31:10.012
Well, nobody wants surgery.

31:10.309 --> 31:11.256
So what?

31:11.524 --> 31:12.636
But he doesn't need it.

31:12.899 --> 31:14.809
Of course he does.
There's a hole in his stomach.

31:15.044 --> 31:18.872
If we don't repair that perf, he's at
risk for peritonitis, sepsis, death.

31:19.139 --> 31:22.968
If you look, there's the ulcer.
But there actually is no leak.

31:23.234 --> 31:25.306
It sealed itself off
against the liver.

31:25.570 --> 31:28.221
This patient was redlined to the O.R.
Who ordered an upper GI?

31:28.482 --> 31:29.342
I did.

31:29.824 --> 31:32.061
- You were supposed to consent him.
- He doesn't want surgery.

31:32.352 --> 31:33.694
- He needs surgery.
- Maybe not.

31:33.920 --> 31:36.701
I found an article that shows
he could be treated medically.

31:36.992 --> 31:38.007
Which is what he wants.

31:38.271 --> 31:40.159
You think this is about what he wants?

31:43.839 --> 31:45.016
I guess. A little bit.

31:46.558 --> 31:47.834
Well, you're wrong.

31:48.094 --> 31:50.614
This job is about determining
what a patient needs...

31:51.101 --> 31:53.621
...and the best way for us,
as surgeons, to meet that need.

31:53.884 --> 31:56.023
And as surgeons, we cut.

31:58.109 --> 32:02.483
As a doctor, if I can find a way to do
what my patient wants...

32:02.779 --> 32:04.754
...that's medically acceptable,
that's what I should do.

32:04.987 --> 32:07.572
I don't believe I should cut
somebody open just because I can.

32:08.890 --> 32:12.402
It bothers me that this patient
is willing to risk death...

32:12.665 --> 32:15.960
...rather than undergo a simple
surgical procedure.

32:16.986 --> 32:18.807
But it bothers me even more...

32:19.513 --> 32:21.618
...that you're so willing
to help him do that.

32:29.238 --> 32:30.034
Sorry.

32:30.679 --> 32:33.712
Mark, I still need you to sign off
on these QA reviews.

32:33.942 --> 32:36.396
- I don't have time.
- But I'm off in five. I just...

32:36.661 --> 32:39.760
Why don't you just leave them at
the desk for me? All right?

32:41.972 --> 32:44.274
Done. Done. Done.

32:44.756 --> 32:47.024
- You look very nice tonight.
- Thank you.

32:47.315 --> 32:48.624
Can you file these for me?

32:48.883 --> 32:50.345
I'll ask Miss Kelly.

32:50.548 --> 32:52.523
- Miss Kelly?
- Our temp clerk tonight.

32:52.820 --> 32:53.746
Why do we have a temp?

32:54.002 --> 32:56.424
I'm sorry, but I don't think
that's any of your business.

32:56.691 --> 32:58.032
Okay. Good night.

32:58.290 --> 33:00.199
- Good night.
- Want to grab a burger?

33:00.465 --> 33:02.440
He is so strange.
Where did we find him?

33:04.018 --> 33:06.766
Nina, hi. Damn!
I was supposed to call you.

33:07.057 --> 33:09.358
I hate having you
think of it that way.

33:09.777 --> 33:11.019
It's been really busy.

33:11.279 --> 33:14.247
- Good first day back?
- Completely fabulous.

33:14.896 --> 33:16.390
Did you call Dr. Gillum?

33:16.687 --> 33:17.897
That PTSD guy?

33:18.127 --> 33:20.167
Well, you are post-trauma.

33:20.462 --> 33:22.023
I know I need time
to settle in...

33:22.223 --> 33:26.019
...but it's not like I'm a postal
worker with an AK-47.

33:28.366 --> 33:29.771
I know you're not.

33:30.861 --> 33:32.683
I'm just trying to help any way I can.

33:32.973 --> 33:35.721
I know, and I appreciate it.
I'm fine.

33:35.948 --> 33:38.086
Everything's getting back to normal.

33:40.236 --> 33:42.057
I don't like you trying
to cover with me.

33:42.411 --> 33:44.418
I don't like you trying
to be a shrink with me.

33:49.513 --> 33:50.441
How's Rachel doing?

33:50.698 --> 33:52.520
She's sleeping over
at a friend's house tonight.

33:53.673 --> 33:55.101
Great. Tell her I say hi.

33:55.336 --> 33:56.198
Sure.

34:05.190 --> 34:07.329
- How are you doing?
- How is she?

34:07.590 --> 34:10.340
Remarkably well, considering.
She's pretty strong.

34:10.599 --> 34:14.656
I wanted to apologize for my
behavior this morning in the delivery.

34:15.110 --> 34:16.866
Thank you, but it's unnecessary.

34:17.637 --> 34:21.695
I've never met a father who could
handle it sensibly, calmly, maturely.

34:21.987 --> 34:25.150
If I ever do, that's the guy
I'm really gonna slap around.

34:26.659 --> 34:29.047
Today was the first day
I was ever afraid.

34:30.498 --> 34:32.321
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

34:34.976 --> 34:38.174
- Better get back in here.
- I'll check on her before I leave.

34:46.081 --> 34:47.509
I made the bed.

34:48.382 --> 34:50.839
Isn't that the stupidest thing
you've ever seen?

34:57.470 --> 34:59.062
I spoke to Dr. Tabash.

34:59.741 --> 35:02.775
He presented another option
for the baby we should consider.

35:04.477 --> 35:06.647
There are a lot of serious
risks involved.

35:06.908 --> 35:09.429
So I'm going to try
to explain them to you.

35:10.877 --> 35:12.469
Then we have a decision to make.

35:18.394 --> 35:20.150
You don't have to change for me.

35:20.410 --> 35:23.344
I'm not changing for you.
You said we were gonna grab a burger.

35:23.610 --> 35:25.814
We can get some burgers
at the Pump Room.

35:26.073 --> 35:28.310
I'm not wearing scrubs
to the Pump Room.

35:29.400 --> 35:31.473
I don't know.
I think it'd be rather daring.

35:32.184 --> 35:33.591
Surprise!

35:34.777 --> 35:36.183
Happy birthday!

35:37.207 --> 35:38.516
Oh, God!
I hate you for this.

35:38.775 --> 35:40.782
It worked out well, don't you think?

35:41.910 --> 35:42.957
Surprise, girl!

35:45.431 --> 35:46.445
That was great.

35:56.564 --> 35:58.801
- What are you doing?
- Waiting for you.

35:59.220 --> 35:59.950
Come on.

36:00.436 --> 36:01.450
Right this way.

36:01.715 --> 36:03.089
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

36:03.316 --> 36:05.682
Come on. Just come over here.
Have a seat.

36:05.970 --> 36:06.919
Okay.

36:11.506 --> 36:13.328
- What's this?
- A little something for you.

36:23.759 --> 36:25.134
A garage-door opener!

36:26.159 --> 36:27.403
Go ahead. Try it.

36:28.847 --> 36:31.235
- I always wanted one of these.
- I know.

36:32.238 --> 36:34.921
- You always said they were stupid.
- They are stupid.

36:35.150 --> 36:38.827
I don't get why a person
can't just open the damn door.

36:42.188 --> 36:44.676
This is the nicest thing
you've ever done for me.

36:45.805 --> 36:47.048
That's pretty pathetic.

36:47.691 --> 36:48.422
I love it.

36:51.468 --> 36:52.482
I love it.

36:59.146 --> 37:00.193
Let's have a beer.

37:05.001 --> 37:05.949
Go ahead.

37:16.103 --> 37:18.491
This is special.
I love having 20 people over...

37:18.758 --> 37:21.180
...especially when I have so much
to serve them. Peel an orange.

37:21.510 --> 37:23.615
Would you lighten up?
They brought booze.

37:23.877 --> 37:25.470
Okay. I'll lighten up.

37:25.829 --> 37:27.716
I'll just have a sip of this milk.

37:28.549 --> 37:30.686
You just drink that
right out of the carton?

37:31.076 --> 37:32.156
What's wrong with that?

37:32.388 --> 37:35.038
Well, it's just kind of
a guy thing to do.

37:35.299 --> 37:36.227
You know.

37:36.772 --> 37:38.364
So what is all this about?

37:38.596 --> 37:39.643
What is what about?

37:40.035 --> 37:44.191
This little dance you did today.
This party. You.

37:45.571 --> 37:49.279
I know you haven't had very good
birthdays the last couple of years.

37:49.537 --> 37:52.188
- The ones I spent with you?
- The ones I forgot.

37:53.504 --> 37:56.373
I just thought it was time
for you to have a nice one.

37:59.008 --> 38:00.185
You want a sip of milk?

38:00.479 --> 38:02.999
Yes, I would love a sip
of this milk. Thank you.

38:06.558 --> 38:07.289
Thank you.

38:11.486 --> 38:13.079
Dr. Weaver.
Excuse me.

38:13.341 --> 38:15.730
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

38:17.372 --> 38:20.950
I know this isn't the right time
or place, but I was curious.

38:21.628 --> 38:24.246
What would be involved with getting
into Emergency Medicine?

38:24.507 --> 38:25.238
What do you mean?

38:25.499 --> 38:28.434
To change one's Residency, would you
have to redo your intern year?

38:28.699 --> 38:31.186
Has "one" talked to Dr. Greene
about this?

38:32.955 --> 38:34.743
You saw how he was in the hall.

39:27.153 --> 39:30.349
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

39:30.960 --> 39:34.342
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

39:35.119 --> 39:38.185
<i>Happy birthday, dear Carol</i>

39:40.623 --> 39:44.299
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

39:44.558 --> 39:45.768
Oh, my God!

39:45.998 --> 39:47.426
Come on, blow them out!

39:48.589 --> 39:51.371
There are so many candles
on this cake. What am I, 55?

39:53.292 --> 39:54.699
Wait! Hold on!
One second.

39:55.500 --> 39:56.231
Almost forgot.

39:56.908 --> 39:57.857
Wait a minute!

39:58.252 --> 39:59.178
Beautiful.

40:01.035 --> 40:01.896
What's that?

40:02.411 --> 40:04.004
It's so your wishes come true.

40:05.738 --> 40:07.527
- Make it a good one.
- All right.

40:10.186 --> 40:11.811
All right, Carol.
You go, girl!

40:13.833 --> 40:16.289
Oh, my God.
You still look so young.
