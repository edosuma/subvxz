Oh, well, best friend.
More than that, really.

08:48.866 --> 08:52.436
Uh, so, Phaedra,
what's your deal, girl?

08:52.536 --> 08:53.403
- Uh, my deal?
- Yeah, you know.

08:53.503 --> 08:55.535
Like, uh, what do you like
to do for fun?

08:55.635 --> 08:58.634
Oh, um...
I don't have fun.

08:58.734 --> 09:00.799
I mostly just
stare at the wall

09:00.899 --> 09:02.370
and dwell on
the nature of guilt.

09:02.470 --> 09:05.634
[chuckles] Yeesh.
Real live wire over here.

09:05.734 --> 09:07.667
You dwell on guilt?
Me, too.

09:07.767 --> 09:09.370
It is one of my favorite
forms of shame.

09:09.470 --> 09:12.733
Really? How do you feel
about self-denial?

09:12.833 --> 09:13.634
I love it. It's like,

09:13.734 --> 09:15.667
how much stuff do you
actually need, self?

09:15.767 --> 09:16.766
Right? So little!

09:16.866 --> 09:17.898
[Prudence laughs] Goals.

09:17.998 --> 09:19.337
Seems like you two
have a lot to talk about,

09:19.437 --> 09:20.568
so I'm just gonna--
I'm gonna go.

09:20.668 --> 09:21.601
- Nice to meet you.
- Okay, quick.

09:21.701 --> 09:24.766
What is your favorite way
of cleansing sin?

09:24.866 --> 09:26.469
One, two, three.

09:26.569 --> 09:28.370
BOTH:
Mortification of the flesh!

09:28.470 --> 09:31.064
- [both talking excitedly]
- Tut tut tut!

09:31.734 --> 09:32.634
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

09:32.734 --> 09:36.403
Oh, your fingers
are like magic, Josiah.

09:36.503 --> 09:37.667
Oh, Prudence.
How great are these Noonans?

09:37.767 --> 09:40.700
They'll do anything you ask
if you say that you're in need,

09:40.800 --> 09:42.898
which as you know, I am.
Hey!

09:42.998 --> 09:45.370
Careful with the nails,
Jethro.

09:45.470 --> 09:47.833
I'm so poor.

09:48.536 --> 09:49.865
What does Zeke like
about that girl?

09:49.965 --> 09:50.766
A bowl of oatmeal in a wig

09:50.866 --> 09:52.238
would have more personality
than her.

09:52.338 --> 09:54.469
Well, I mean, the Reverend's
a pretty boring guy, too,

09:54.569 --> 09:56.734
so it seems like
the perfect match.

09:57.404 --> 09:59.436
[scoffs] Whatever.
It's just one date.

09:59.536 --> 10:00.667
It's not like
they're getting married.

10:00.767 --> 10:01.700
[bell ringing]

10:01.800 --> 10:04.700
Glorious news,
brothers and sisters.

10:04.800 --> 10:05.568
Ezekiel and Phaedra

10:05.668 --> 10:08.238
found their first date
satisfactory.

10:08.338 --> 10:10.436
So the wedding will commence
this afternoon.

10:10.536 --> 10:11.238
- What?
- Noonans!

10:11.338 --> 10:14.535
Let's show them how we say
congratulations.

10:14.635 --> 10:16.602
NOONANS: Congratulations.

10:16.767 --> 10:19.832
Don't stop.
[moans]

10:19.932 --> 10:21.634
Any last words?

10:21.734 --> 10:23.832
Eh...

10:23.932 --> 10:24.799
Maybe.

10:24.899 --> 10:25.865
You know what?
No, I'm good.

10:25.965 --> 10:27.799
Then tell the devil...

10:27.899 --> 10:29.766
Trig says hi.

10:29.866 --> 10:31.667
Yeah, okay.

10:31.767 --> 10:34.370
Yes, Dad,
is there a problem?

10:34.470 --> 10:36.667
What? No.
You're doing great.

10:36.767 --> 10:37.403
Okay, then.

10:37.503 --> 10:40.370
Tell the devil
Trig says hi.

10:40.470 --> 10:41.370
[yawns] Oh, God.
Excuse me.

10:41.470 --> 10:42.832
Okay, clearly you have
something to say,

10:42.932 --> 10:44.799
so why don't
you just say it?

10:44.899 --> 10:45.667
Okay, it's just...

10:45.767 --> 10:48.502
can we do something better
than shooting him?

10:48.602 --> 10:49.469
Anybody can shoot a guy.

10:49.569 --> 10:51.502
I mean,
where's the showmanship?

10:51.602 --> 10:53.535
What about tying him
to the train tracks,

10:53.635 --> 10:55.337
or throw him off a cliff?
Something.

10:55.437 --> 10:57.502
This is the way
I like to kill people.

10:57.602 --> 10:58.733
It is clean.
It is efficient.

10:58.833 --> 11:01.271
"I'm Trig,
the efficiency machine.

11:01.371 --> 11:03.634
What is the square root
of killing a guy?"

11:03.734 --> 11:05.568
[crew laughs]
Okay, I don't sound like that.

11:05.668 --> 11:06.535
You know what
might be fun?

11:06.635 --> 11:08.469
Take a big rock
and just drop it on him.

11:08.569 --> 11:10.568
That's fun.
What if we tie his limbs

11:10.668 --> 11:11.766
to horses
and rip him apart?

11:11.866 --> 11:13.634
What if we do something
bad to his penis?

11:13.734 --> 11:14.799
Actually, could you
just shoot me?

11:14.899 --> 11:16.304
We could make him
sit on some knives.

11:16.404 --> 11:18.436
He'd bleed from his butt.Now we're cooking.
What else?

11:18.536 --> 11:19.766
Feed him
to the alligators.
In the desert?

11:19.866 --> 11:21.370
You ain't got alligators
out here?
[exhales]

11:21.470 --> 11:22.865
Cut off his legs
and call him Shorty.

11:22.965 --> 11:25.337
Or we can just let him go.

11:25.437 --> 11:25.894
Who said that?

11:25.904 --> 11:28.733
- [horn plays "strip" music]
- [men cheer]

11:28.833 --> 11:31.370
[cheers and applause]

11:31.470 --> 11:33.205
Hey, Zeke, can I talk to you
for a sec?

11:33.305 --> 11:35.601
I'm sorry. Is this stripper
puttingonclothes?

11:35.701 --> 11:37.502
Yes, the Noonans
are throwing me

11:37.602 --> 11:38.663
a traditional Noonan
bachelor party

11:38.673 --> 11:40.766
and technically she's
a dresser, not a stripper.

11:40.866 --> 11:44.370
Put it on, baby!
Oopsies.

11:44.470 --> 11:46.371
[cheers continue]

11:49.064 --> 11:51.931
Zeke, are you sure about
this whole marriage thing?

11:52.031 --> 11:54.403
I know it seems quick,
but Phaedra and I

11:54.503 --> 11:55.403
have so much in common.

11:55.503 --> 11:56.535
It's like I'm marrying
my sister!

11:56.635 --> 11:59.568
Uh, yeah, that's not
usually the goal.

11:59.668 --> 12:00.700
Don't you want to be
with someone

12:00.800 --> 12:01.667
you have chemistry with?

12:01.767 --> 12:02.700
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm confused.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.370
You were the one telling me
I should move on.

12:04.470 --> 12:06.766
Now I've done that and you're
being really weird about it.

12:06.866 --> 12:09.535
I'm just looking out for you,
as a friend.

12:09.635 --> 12:11.370
Okay, well, thanks, Pru,

12:11.470 --> 12:12.733
but Phaedra's
the right person for me.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.832
Ezekiel! Get over here!

12:14.932 --> 12:16.965
Ooh!
Gotta make it rain!

12:18.602 --> 12:20.536
Alms for the poor?

12:21.338 --> 12:24.667
[cheers and applause]
Yeah! God bless you.

12:24.767 --> 12:26.766
Now this is an execution--

12:26.866 --> 12:28.238
death by fire ants.

12:28.338 --> 12:30.766
Uch. I really hate you
for this one, Benny.

12:30.866 --> 12:32.700
I still don't see how
this is any better

12:32.800 --> 12:33.568
than just shooting him.

12:33.668 --> 12:34.766
What? This is way cooler.

12:34.866 --> 12:35.667
Back me up here, Dingus.

12:35.767 --> 12:37.634
Yeah, I hate to say it,
but this is cooler.

12:37.734 --> 12:43.205
Now to apply the honey,
and let the ant buffet begin.

12:43.305 --> 12:43.564
Aah!

12:43.574 --> 12:45.568
Oh, oh, oh, here.
Why don't you do the honors?

12:45.668 --> 12:46.568
Oh, no.
Why don't you do it?

12:46.668 --> 12:48.469
I mean, clearly you're
running the gang now.

12:48.569 --> 12:50.634
Don't be like that.
You're still in charge.

12:50.734 --> 12:51.667
- You can do it.
- No, you do it.

12:51.767 --> 12:52.964
Maybe we should just
pick it up tomorrow.

12:53.064 --> 12:54.535
- Just do it!
- No, I don't want to do it.

12:54.635 --> 12:57.766
- Don't be a baby and do it!
- I said, I don't want to!

12:57.866 --> 12:58.865
- God!
- Yeesh.

12:58.965 --> 13:01.337
You want to know the real
reason I shot you in the back?

13:01.437 --> 13:04.634
It's because everything
always has to be about you.

13:04.734 --> 13:08.337
I was always second fiddle
to the great Benny the Teen!

13:08.437 --> 13:10.964
And you're so egotistical,
you can't stand the idea

13:11.064 --> 13:14.766
that I might be better
at leading the gang than you!

13:14.866 --> 13:15.502
And now, I'm crying

13:15.602 --> 13:17.337
in front of the prisoner,
so that's just great.

13:17.437 --> 13:20.799
Oh, no, don't mind me.
I'm just looking at the dirt.

13:20.899 --> 13:22.535
You all suck.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.799
Trig! What--
[sighs]

13:24.899 --> 13:27.535
Drama! [laughs]

13:27.635 --> 13:28.634
Am I right, guys?

13:28.734 --> 13:30.865
Welcome to Brother Ezekiel

13:30.965 --> 13:33.469
and Sister Phaedra's
rehearsal lunch.

13:33.569 --> 13:35.337
Let me tell you,
my girl Phaedra

13:35.437 --> 13:36.799
can get a little crazy.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.403
Oh, no! Here it comes.

13:38.503 --> 13:40.634
Like when she organized
a church crawl,

13:40.734 --> 13:44.469
and prayed at 15 chapels
in one night.

13:44.569 --> 13:46.766
I got so...rewarded.

13:46.866 --> 13:47.535
This is insane.

13:47.635 --> 13:49.799
It's like he's a completely
different person with her.

13:49.899 --> 13:50.898
Sorry, dear,
did you say something?

13:50.998 --> 13:53.734
I can't hear you
with the fan in my ear.

13:53.899 --> 13:56.403
Well, don't stop.
I'm a hot little baby.

13:56.503 --> 13:59.799
You are going to be
the meekest bride ever.

13:59.899 --> 14:01.601
I love you
like a sister wife.

14:01.701 --> 14:02.898
- Aw!
- [polite applause]

14:02.998 --> 14:04.403
[glass clinks]

14:04.503 --> 14:07.568
Hey, everybody.
Zeke's bestie here.

14:07.668 --> 14:09.766
Sorry to interrupt
the swell time

14:09.866 --> 14:12.370
we're allnothaving.

14:12.470 --> 14:13.998
[laughs]

14:14.899 --> 14:16.865
Whoo. Tough crowd.

14:16.965 --> 14:18.205
She's bombing.

14:18.305 --> 14:20.370
So, I know Phaedra
thinks she's marrying

14:20.470 --> 14:22.931
this upright man of God,

14:23.031 --> 14:25.865
but I actually know
a different Zeke.

14:25.965 --> 14:26.667
[nervous laughter]

14:26.767 --> 14:28.403
Where are--where are you
going with this, Pru?

14:28.503 --> 14:30.898
For example,
everyone sees Zeke

14:30.998 --> 14:33.271
as this very proper guy,
and he is,

14:33.371 --> 14:36.733
except for when he eats
too many beans on the trail

14:36.833 --> 14:39.337
and becomes
Colonel Fartington.

14:39.437 --> 14:40.634
I don't know what
she's talking about.

14:40.734 --> 14:42.469
Oh, come on!
Yes, you do.

14:42.569 --> 14:43.535
[Southern accent]
I do declare,

14:43.635 --> 14:45.535
I've made a stinky
in my pantaloons!

14:45.635 --> 14:47.535
- [crowd murmurs]
- I don't do the accent!

14:47.635 --> 14:48.766
Who's Colonel Fartington?

14:48.866 --> 14:51.799
Zeke likes to say,
"Early to bed, early to rise,"

14:51.899 --> 14:54.337
but I've seen
this night owl

14:54.437 --> 14:55.469
stay up until past 9:00.

14:55.569 --> 14:56.469
That's not too bad.

14:56.569 --> 14:57.059
- Thirty!
- What?!

14:57.069 --> 14:59.568
What are you doing?
And I've saved the dirtiest

14:59.668 --> 15:00.799
little secret for last.

15:00.899 --> 15:01.700
Pru, please, don't.

15:01.800 --> 15:05.535
Because my man Zeke is
a full-blown,

15:05.635 --> 15:06.535
raging...

15:06.635 --> 15:09.568
- chocoholic!
- [all gasp]

15:09.668 --> 15:10.469
What the [bleep]?

15:10.569 --> 15:11.667
I had a small thing
for malt balls,

15:11.767 --> 15:12.733
but I am good now,
I swear.

15:12.833 --> 15:15.403
I didn't even know
who you are anymore!
No!

15:15.503 --> 15:18.238
Phaedra! I've been clean
for months!

15:18.338 --> 15:20.766
What was that?!
You just ruined my marriage!

15:20.866 --> 15:23.370
That girl was a dud.
I'm doing you a favor.

15:23.470 --> 15:24.535
How is that a favor?
You reject me,

15:24.635 --> 15:26.733
and then you take away
my only other chance at love?

15:26.833 --> 15:27.832
I'm just trying
to be your friend.

15:27.932 --> 15:29.568
Well, how about this?
Next time you want

15:29.668 --> 15:31.800
to be my friend, just don't.

15:37.470 --> 15:40.436
[exhales]
You are a good bandit.

15:40.536 --> 15:43.865
You've stolen lots
of money.

15:43.965 --> 15:46.064
Knock, knock.

15:46.800 --> 15:47.502
What do you want?

15:47.602 --> 15:48.795
I've been thinking about
what you said earlier,

15:48.805 --> 15:52.469
and, uh, I really do want us
to have a good relationship.

15:52.569 --> 15:55.899
And I think I finally see
where you're coming from.

15:59.602 --> 16:02.305
- And?
- [sighs]

16:02.701 --> 16:05.733
You're upset because I...

16:05.833 --> 16:07.502
well, I'm good at
leading the gang,

16:07.602 --> 16:09.601
and well,
you kinda suck at it.

16:09.701 --> 16:11.832
See, I'm
a natural-born alpha

16:11.932 --> 16:14.271
with competence
and charisma to spare,

16:14.371 --> 16:16.865
and you're more of
a beta follower type.

16:16.965 --> 16:19.337
I know it must be so hard
living in the shadow

16:19.437 --> 16:23.205
of someone who's better
than you in every single way,

16:23.305 --> 16:25.898
but sweetie, the sooner
that you can accept it,

16:25.998 --> 16:27.634
then the sooner
we can get back

16:27.734 --> 16:30.899
to having
a good relationship.

16:31.866 --> 16:35.668
Wow, that felt so good
to get off my chest.

16:35.965 --> 16:37.568
Hear this, Benny.

16:37.668 --> 16:42.403
You and I will never
have a relationship.

16:42.503 --> 16:46.865
As far as I'm concerned,
you're dead to me.

16:46.965 --> 16:49.898
Do you understand that?

16:49.998 --> 16:51.899
Dead!

16:52.965 --> 16:55.733
Well, that didn't go
as well as I expected.

16:55.833 --> 16:56.766
All right, look,

Phaedra took some time

and found somebody new.

It's okay, though.

Phaedra, you need

I know I said some vaguely
damning things about him,
