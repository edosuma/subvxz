00:46.807 --> 00:48.295
Emergency?

00:54.739 --> 00:55.730
Hello?

00:57.982 --> 00:59.190
What's the problem?

01:00.307 --> 01:01.438
Hello?

01:01.515 --> 01:02.833
Help.

01:07.642 --> 01:08.801
They're sick.

01:13.697 --> 01:15.591
They're all sick.

01:29.718 --> 01:31.971
There's blood..

01:33.366 --> 01:35.964
There's blood..

01:36.084 --> 01:37.346
Everywhere.

01:52.389 --> 01:54.131
They're looking for us.

01:55.318 --> 01:56.117
Please.

02:04.759 --> 02:06.054
Find us.

03:00.830 --> 03:03.028
The incidents in the States
were isolated.

03:03.077 --> 03:04.556
Successfuly contained.

03:04.596 --> 03:06.098
We don't know how
it reached there.

03:06.140 --> 03:09.733
Your inability to manage and contain
this situation is mind boggling.

03:09.765 --> 03:14.461
Let me be frank, under your guidance
we're now standing face to face with a catasrophic shitstorm..

03:14.509 --> 03:17.808
And i am standing face to face
with incompetence.

03:18.008 --> 03:19.039
Translate.

03:19.478 --> 03:20.781
May i have your attention please?

03:21.573 --> 03:23.492
From here on,
the team is small.

03:24.212 --> 03:26.748
No parents,
no family.

03:26.940 --> 03:29.746
Anyone meeting that criteria,
please go the the exits now.

03:31.640 --> 03:34.527
If something's go sideways,
i've never been good in sending flowers.

03:40.331 --> 03:41.250
Pull it up.

03:42.886 --> 03:45.843
Ground Zero was a non-profit housing
for Humanity's Project.

03:45.963 --> 03:48.297
American tourists building shacks
for the poor.

03:48.576 --> 03:50.550
Fatalities were discovered on site.

03:50.814 --> 03:52.230
One anomaly.

03:56.002 --> 03:57.457
The sample arrived this morning.

03:57.497 --> 03:58.448
Bridget..

03:58.657 --> 04:01.646
He's not a sample. He's a patient.
-Yes.

04:02.559 --> 04:04.029
He's Patient Zero.

04:13.702 --> 04:14.590
Mr Porter?

04:16.404 --> 04:17.435
Mr Porter?

04:17.555 --> 04:19.394
My name is Dr. Edwards.

04:47.502 --> 04:48.961
We are..

04:49.081 --> 04:50.869
On the verge..

04:50.989 --> 04:52.761
Of a global pandemic.

04:52.881 --> 04:54.469
And you are..

04:54.589 --> 04:58.971
The only known carrier of this virus
who's asymtopmatic.

04:59.401 --> 05:00.849
The good news..

05:01.129 --> 05:03.666
Is that it's not an airborne virus.

05:03.686 --> 05:05.384
And the bad news is..

05:05.504 --> 05:07.482
We have no way
of containing it.

05:08.957 --> 05:10.625
Where is my son?

05:11.624 --> 05:13.697
We're supposed to go somewhere.

05:13.817 --> 05:15.195
His prep school.

05:15.535 --> 05:18.667
We have to buy books
and pencils.

05:20.485 --> 05:22.673
Your son is dead, Mr Porter.

05:22.963 --> 05:24.366
I think you know that.

05:33.293 --> 05:35.020
You have..

05:35.559 --> 05:37.747
An incredible
opportunity.

05:37.867 --> 05:40.005
To do something special.

05:42.026 --> 05:43.615
I can't help you.

05:46.337 --> 05:47.986
I wasn't asking.

05:49.005 --> 05:51.104
I don't know who the fuck
you think you are..

06:29.163 --> 06:30.751
There he is.
There he is.

06:31.171 --> 06:32.300
Yeah.

06:32.420 --> 06:34.759
Hey, friend!
-Hey!

06:38.164 --> 06:39.642
What's up, bro?

06:40.811 --> 06:43.023
What the hell
are you wearing?

06:43.233 --> 06:46.290
What do you mean?
Kate wants me to look sophisticated.

06:46.550 --> 06:48.425
What's so funny?

06:48.855 --> 06:50.513
Why were you so late?

06:50.633 --> 06:52.769
Oh the transportation,
they ran a little late.

06:52.889 --> 06:55.097
I got like an extra $600 on them, though.

06:55.117 --> 06:57.634
Really?
-What do you think? It's about time we..

06:57.894 --> 07:03.217
Do the whole 30 footer boat,
maybe expand the dive shot?

07:03.337 --> 07:07.210
Let's talk business after the wedding, let me just get through this first, alright?
-Alright.

07:07.240 --> 07:10.741
We're late, we're so late.
Kate's whole family is waiting for us.

07:11.221 --> 07:13.269
Come on, we gotta get going.

07:13.389 --> 07:14.819
I'm glad you can make it.

07:14.939 --> 07:18.375
What do you mean, glad i can make it?
Marky, look at me.

07:18.735 --> 07:21.504
I wouldn't miss this
for the world, brother. Alright?

07:34.942 --> 07:37.169
Bro, this one's taken.

07:40.346 --> 07:41.994
So rude.

07:43.513 --> 07:46.674
To Marcus' brother,
wherever he's hiding.

07:46.794 --> 07:48.552
A warm thank you.

07:48.812 --> 07:52.605
And i'd like to offer a special toast
to those who couldn't be here tonight.

07:52.635 --> 07:54.613
Marcus' parents.

07:55.053 --> 07:56.452
They'll be dearly missed.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.447
You're the guy, buddy.
You're the guy.

08:10.396 --> 08:13.834
Marcus, you promised.
-Promise what?

08:15.312 --> 08:18.829
Oh no.. What is he wearing?

08:19.469 --> 08:21.040
Wait one second.

08:21.420 --> 08:23.678
I'll take care of this.
I'll be right back.

08:26.026 --> 08:28.811
Alright, who ate all the food?

08:30.070 --> 08:31.668
This guy.

08:31.788 --> 08:33.787
Hey Josh..
-Hey.

08:35.296 --> 08:37.335
Come on, i think you've had enough.

08:38.005 --> 08:40.134
Hola.
-Hey.

08:40.683 --> 08:42.523
Hey Marky, long time.

08:42.643 --> 08:44.011
Penny..

08:46.592 --> 08:47.691
What?

08:51.456 --> 08:55.672
Guys, guys come on.
There's water right there.

08:56.362 --> 08:59.619
What happened to the shirt i left out for you?
And the pants?

09:00.518 --> 09:02.930
Dude, this looks really cool.

09:04.898 --> 09:06.766
Is it good?
Good food?

09:06.886 --> 09:08.211
Aloha.

09:08.331 --> 09:11.697
Go, go,
go get your lady, man.

09:12.906 --> 09:14.575
This is pretty.

09:27.229 --> 09:30.783
We're gonna..
Why don't we get some fresh oranges?

09:40.917 --> 09:42.855
Very lucky man..
How do i say lucky man?

09:47.684 --> 09:49.043
Helo, friend.

09:49.822 --> 09:51.117
What's up?

10:04.929 --> 10:06.338
No, thank you.

10:17.836 --> 10:20.683
She's not trying to sell it to you,
she's trying to give it to you.

10:22.202 --> 10:25.447
It's a Puka.

10:25.737 --> 10:28.184
It's for protection,
against evil.

10:28.843 --> 10:30.561
From..
Santeria.

10:30.661 --> 10:32.589
Like a..

10:32.689 --> 10:34.627
Central America voodoo thing.

10:34.647 --> 10:37.624
Beheaded chickens,
sacrifices..

10:38.293 --> 10:40.239
Gotta love the third world.

10:51.106 --> 10:52.165
Marky..

10:52.395 --> 10:54.143
Yo, check that one.

10:55.558 --> 10:57.227
Yeah, not too shabby.

10:57.347 --> 10:59.025
Why don't you take it
for a test drive?

10:59.055 --> 11:01.549
Yeah right.
-Hello, friends.

11:01.759 --> 11:03.307
Marky Marcus..

11:03.846 --> 11:05.345
Your brother and i..

11:05.375 --> 11:09.037
Your two best..
Your two lifers..

11:09.157 --> 11:14.110
Your two fuck ups, who couldn't afford
a real bachelor party back home..

11:14.340 --> 11:16.438
Have conspired to pull this off.

11:17.314 --> 11:19.402
Bro, we've been planning this
for months.

11:19.522 --> 11:22.209
One last night of freedom
with the old crew.

11:22.279 --> 11:25.340
And a charterred trip to a deserted
tropical island.

11:25.460 --> 11:28.467
Full of beers, suns,
and virgin bitches..

11:28.587 --> 11:30.205
Beaches..
-Beaches.

11:30.325 --> 11:31.674
Sand, water..

11:36.154 --> 11:38.371
For real?
-Have a good time, babe.

11:41.122 --> 11:45.450
Wait a sec, so all that crap
about no bachelor party?

11:45.570 --> 11:47.208
Was prep..

11:48.447 --> 11:51.695
Hey man, hotel already loaded our bags.
-No..

11:51.815 --> 11:53.603
No..

11:54.454 --> 11:57.660
Don't forget to wear sunscreen,
i don't want you sunburned in all the photos tomorrow.

11:57.780 --> 12:00.515
I won't.
-And do not go too far north.

12:00.635 --> 12:02.433
It's restricted waters.

12:02.692 --> 12:05.100
Hey, if you're so worried,
why don't you come?

12:05.220 --> 12:07.532
It wouldn't be a bachelor party
if i'm there.

12:08.381 --> 12:10.080
Why is Penny going?

12:12.742 --> 12:15.839
She's practically one of the guys,
you guys grew up together.

12:15.959 --> 12:19.254
Besides, my family is having
this thing for me tonight and..

12:19.374 --> 12:21.478
It'll be terribly stiff
and proper.

12:21.748 --> 12:24.196
She'd be miserable.
-Would she?

12:25.015 --> 12:27.335
It's easier on all of us.

12:27.455 --> 12:29.642
Go have a good time,
you deserve it.

12:29.762 --> 12:31.391
You're a horrible liar.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.431
You're beautiful.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.618
I'll miss you.

12:47.314 --> 12:49.522
Bye.
-Okay..

12:49.642 --> 12:51.171
There he is.
-Okay.

12:51.291 --> 12:52.889
Yeah!
-Okay.

12:54.372 --> 12:57.798
Let's keep it adjusted.
Tune time, tune time.

13:15.803 --> 13:18.300
Three blind mice..

13:18.420 --> 13:21.022
Three blind mice..

13:21.142 --> 13:23.789
See how they run..

13:39.152 --> 13:41.240
My mother used to sing
that to me.

13:42.059 --> 13:44.028
I love children's songs.

13:44.967 --> 13:46.995
Your children song
is a protest..

13:47.115 --> 13:51.137
Against the wrongful imprisonment,
torture and execution of three Protestans..

13:51.157 --> 13:53.191
By Queen Mary
in the 1500s.

13:53.311 --> 13:55.169
Porter, please.

13:56.148 --> 13:58.907
You can't go days without
talking to anyone.

13:59.027 --> 14:00.995
Please, talk to me.

14:01.464 --> 14:03.013
Oh, you want to talk?

14:03.512 --> 14:04.695
Okay.

14:05.145 --> 14:06.803
How's my wife?

14:08.861 --> 14:10.401
Does she know
i'm here?

14:11.101 --> 14:12.639
She knows about
her son?

14:14.979 --> 14:16.927
Does she know
that he melted in my arms?

14:18.306 --> 14:19.754
Does she?

14:19.874 --> 14:20.631
Porter, stop.

14:20.751 --> 14:23.808
They all ran after the farmer's wife,
and cut off their tails with a carving knife..

14:23.928 --> 14:26.786
Porter, stop!
Don't put yourself through this.

14:27.406 --> 14:28.934
Please.

14:29.151 --> 14:31.809
I'm a US citizen,
i have rights.

14:32.138 --> 14:34.888
I want to talk to the
American Embassy.

14:35.008 --> 14:38.475
It's the US CDC law that requires
that you'd be quarantined.

14:38.844 --> 14:40.641
You're a pandemic carrier.

14:40.761 --> 14:42.239
We're not in
United States.

14:42.359 --> 14:44.047
This is extraordinary rendition..

14:44.167 --> 14:46.593
You can't just keep
experimenting on me!

14:46.713 --> 14:49.590
Porter, you're not just
a carrier.

14:50.399 --> 14:52.588
You're a possible cure.

14:52.987 --> 14:55.325
You have a natural imunity
to the virus.

14:55.445 --> 14:57.781
Try to focus on the good
that you're providing.

14:57.811 --> 14:59.699
I've complied to everything
you've wanted.

14:59.819 --> 15:01.935
You've poked and prodded on me
for two months.

15:02.055 --> 15:03.983
If i don't talk to my wife
in the next 15 minutes..

15:04.036 --> 15:07.065
I swear to God, i'm gonna kill myself.
Do you hear me?

15:07.185 --> 15:09.291
I'm gonna fucking
kill myself!

15:09.315 --> 15:11.090
I've spoken with Christina.

15:14.904 --> 15:15.896
Porter.

15:16.141 --> 15:18.133
She knows about your son.

15:22.295 --> 15:25.426
She also knows that you are here with us
in quarantine.

15:25.907 --> 15:28.017
Obviously she's worried about you.

15:29.409 --> 15:32.280
She wanted me to tell you
that she loves you very much.

15:34.652 --> 15:36.213
And she'll be waiting for you.

15:53.803 --> 15:55.499
I want you to know something.

15:57.432 --> 15:59.636
I'm not just dangerous to myself.

16:17.931 --> 16:19.821
They are remarkable specimens.

16:19.941 --> 16:21.087
Human.

16:21.207 --> 16:24.463
You mean human, don't you doctor?
He's a human being.

16:26.835 --> 16:28.616
Get up, come on.

16:35.683 --> 16:38.577
What we have in that cage
isn't just a man.

16:38.697 --> 16:40.495
It is the engine of a new
life form..

16:40.549 --> 16:43.175
And make no mistake,
it wants to destroy us.

16:43.991 --> 16:46.573
Don't personalize this,
Camila.

16:47.020 --> 16:50.196
Sometimes we have to
harm one..

16:50.230 --> 16:52.340
In order to save millions.

17:25.255 --> 17:27.622
The sample's in the ready position, doctor.

17:27.742 --> 17:30.205
Good morning, Mr Porter.
It's time for your 8.30.

17:30.593 --> 17:32.539
Jorge, prepare for another extraction.

17:32.573 --> 17:34.885
Mark it 0713.

17:35.005 --> 17:39.652
Bridget, i'll need a full work up
on the genome and the basic protein.

18:19.881 --> 18:21.511
Don't you get up, Mr Porter.

18:21.545 --> 18:22.659
Don't you move.

18:22.779 --> 18:25.165
It's my blood you want, right?
You want it?

18:25.285 --> 18:26.293
Take it!

18:29.559 --> 18:32.565
You want to shoot me?
Come on, shoot!

18:41.368 --> 18:42.372
Wait!

18:42.492 --> 18:43.857
This is a mistake.

18:43.977 --> 18:46.153
The situation has been contained.
-Hello?

18:46.273 --> 18:47.678
The sample is still secure.

18:47.798 --> 18:49.670
I'm sorry, Doctor.
As you know..

18:49.712 --> 18:54.164
The protocol requires a mandatory facility lockdown of 48 hours.

18:54.805 --> 18:59.221
All of the staff will be temporarily transferred
to the evacuation bunker.

18:59.263 --> 19:01.837
Where we wait for
re-entry clearance.

19:02.462 --> 19:04.694
I'm sure you understand.

19:07.352 --> 19:09.806
We will see you in two days.

19:42.190 --> 19:43.262
Friend.

19:48.009 --> 19:50.929
You always had the biggest crush on her
back in second grade.

19:51.049 --> 19:52.581
You never want to admit it.

19:52.631 --> 19:54.843
So when's the last time
you saw Penny anyway?

19:57.435 --> 20:00.228
Alright, on your feet soldiers!

20:00.532 --> 20:02.068
Come on!

20:04.358 --> 20:06.620
Alright boys, man up.

20:06.662 --> 20:08.463
Open up your hatches on 3.

20:08.506 --> 20:10.548
1.. 2.. 3.

20:21.620 --> 20:23.899
Come on, you're the one who taught me
how to do this.

20:23.935 --> 20:25.640
Yeah, when i was 19.

20:25.690 --> 20:27.209
Now i drink for flavor.

20:27.766 --> 20:29.873
Oh yeah, that's for babies.

20:29.923 --> 20:32.202
He's all fancy now that
he's marrying into money.

20:32.252 --> 20:34.556
Hey, hey..
Jokes aside..

20:35.206 --> 20:36.962
Marky Marcus.

20:37.082 --> 20:39.131
As your little bro
and best friend.

20:39.738 --> 20:42.278
Tomorrow night when you wed
the lovely Kate..

20:42.398 --> 20:45.620
The single world will mourn the loss
of one of the greats.

20:46.164 --> 20:47.565
And in honor of that..

20:47.685 --> 20:51.515
I got you something meaningful
to help prepare you for a new life.

20:51.536 --> 20:53.604
What is this, Joshie?
What did you get me?

20:54.186 --> 20:55.739
What is this?

20:56.237 --> 20:58.898
Oh, is this about that thing?

20:58.931 --> 21:02.037
Open it.
-What could this be?

21:08.264 --> 21:09.834
Boom!
-Boom!

21:11.024 --> 21:14.205
Thanks guys, i can take care
of my girl.

21:14.230 --> 21:19.039
It's not for her, that's for you.
Getting you all loosen up for all the bend over you'll be doing.

21:19.081 --> 21:21.757
I told these boners
they were crossing the line.

21:21.799 --> 21:23.166
Alright, it's my turn.

21:24.173 --> 21:25.987
But mine needs an explanation.

21:26.916 --> 21:31.454
Do you remember when we were kids
and you went to go inside the Street Lamp Charade?

21:31.574 --> 21:32.822
Yeah.

21:33.319 --> 21:35.233
What is it?
-Open it.

21:36.110 --> 21:37.680
So you always know
where you came from.

21:37.800 --> 21:39.309
Oh wow..
-Watch.

21:40.264 --> 21:42.830
That's awesome, thank you so much, Pen.

21:43.378 --> 21:44.670
It's so cool.

21:49.671 --> 21:50.566
Alright.

21:50.686 --> 21:52.743
This is your own present.

21:57.493 --> 21:59.417
No, fuck no.
-Woo Woo..

21:59.501 --> 22:01.417
Hey hey.. We spent a fortune on that.

22:01.451 --> 22:04.379
You guys know how much trouble we're gonna get
if the Coast Guard finds this on here?

22:04.738 --> 22:07.785
Not to mention Kate's family,
how embarassed they'll be guys.

22:07.905 --> 22:09.525
God forbid that happens.

22:09.645 --> 22:11.391
Mark, Mark..

22:12.783 --> 22:15.007
We've been going north
for a while now.

22:15.127 --> 22:17.826
We haven't seen a boat in 2 hours.

22:19.007 --> 22:20.154
Hey, hey..

22:20.914 --> 22:25.098
Think we're far enough away from civilization
where you can relax a little bit, maybe..

22:25.218 --> 22:26.373
Let loose?

22:27.166 --> 22:29.992
Yeah, yeah.
-There we go. It's that kid..

22:30.034 --> 22:32.659
There he is, come here.

22:33.115 --> 22:35.694
Firing up from Kate's
scornful lies.

22:36.191 --> 22:38.917
Stop with the comments about Kate, please.

22:38.951 --> 22:40.202
It's just a joke, bro.

22:40.236 --> 22:42.582
No, you don't like her.
I get it.

22:43.485 --> 22:46.084
Now shut up, because after tomorrow night..

22:47.324 --> 22:48.886
That's my wife
you're talking about.

22:49.671 --> 22:52.867
Marky Mark, come on dude.
Hey!

22:54.176 --> 22:55.062
What?

22:55.182 --> 22:57.291
When you get married,
you can't take a joke anymore?

23:02.724 --> 23:04.218
You see what's going on, right?

23:05.096 --> 23:07.046
They're scared that you're marrying up.

23:07.868 --> 23:09.657
And you'll gonna leave them behind.

23:11.109 --> 23:13.330
I'm not gonna leave
them behind.

23:14.605 --> 23:16.664
What's wrong with wanting more
than what you grew up with?

23:16.698 --> 23:17.812
Nothing.

23:18.833 --> 23:20.555
If that's what you really want.

23:25.001 --> 23:26.470
Is it?
-Penny..

23:28.816 --> 23:29.879
What do you want?

23:30.470 --> 23:32.178
Penny, come on.
That's not the..

23:32.298 --> 23:34.541
That's not the point,
Kate gets me.

23:36.027 --> 23:38.297
She's not like the people
we grew up with.

23:42.547 --> 23:43.922
And what's wrong with us?

23:47.390 --> 23:48.538
Nothing.

23:49.601 --> 23:51.433
Kate just sees more for me.

23:52.652 --> 23:55.404
There was a time when you told me
something similar.

23:56.653 --> 23:58.249
Penny, we were kids.

23:59.532 --> 24:00.536
Funny.

24:00.798 --> 24:03.302
I remember doing some
pretty adult things.

24:03.682 --> 24:06.839
Hey, hey, come on.
You're with Josh now.

24:06.959 --> 24:08.425
Josh is fun.

24:08.900 --> 24:10.690
But not serious.

24:11.156 --> 24:13.707
Kate's serious,
but not fun.

24:14.845 --> 24:16.895
Maybe we both made
the wrong choice.

24:17.439 --> 24:19.041
It was one summer.

24:21.828 --> 24:23.879
Don't make it more
than it was.

24:26.382 --> 24:28.506
Sorry, gotta get..
Gotta go.

24:33.721 --> 24:35.977
Hey, she blows..

24:36.097 --> 24:37.594
Check it out.

24:40.809 --> 24:43.403
That's the deserted paradise, huh?

24:44.271 --> 24:46.104
It's Never Neverland, Marky.

24:46.574 --> 24:47.824
It's not even on the map.

24:49.301 --> 24:50.337
So..

24:51.146 --> 24:51.935
Is that..

24:52.994 --> 24:55.808
Is that a building on the northern side
of the ridge over there?

24:56.301 --> 24:57.400
What bui..
What?

24:59.448 --> 25:03.435
Hey, it's supposed to be virgin beach,
understand?

25:03.686 --> 25:06.303
No.. No people.

25:06.423 --> 25:08.065
No building.

25:14.569 --> 25:15.730
What does that mean?

25:17.636 --> 25:19.322
Nobody home.

25:20.409 --> 25:22.966
Nobody home.
Nobody home.

25:23.025 --> 25:25.169
Alright. Nobody home.
-Nobody home.

25:27.313 --> 25:29.401
Hey, so we'll see you tomorrow.

25:29.874 --> 25:31.124
Tomorrow.

25:33.264 --> 25:34.240
But..

25:36.843 --> 25:38.477
Whatever.

25:39.038 --> 25:41.189
It is beautiful up here.

25:44.837 --> 25:46.833
Wish us luck.

25:51.839 --> 25:54.087
Breaker breaker,
this is Eagle Eye 1.

25:54.139 --> 25:56.742
Please advise Mr. Ares
that his son in law..

25:56.787 --> 26:00.506
Is about to get high as a motherfucker.
-Hey, come on.
-Relax.

26:00.626 --> 26:02.421
This thing only go for like a mile.

26:11.808 --> 26:13.671
You guys want to head out
by the reef?

26:14.018 --> 26:16.984
And catch hundreds of fish?
It'll be unreal.

26:17.104 --> 26:19.180
I hear it's not to be missed.

26:19.852 --> 26:21.662
So why aren't you guys going?

26:22.031 --> 26:23.355
I'm just gonna chill, bro.

26:23.475 --> 26:24.486
We dive everyday.

26:24.538 --> 26:28.190
But when you guys get back,
we'll have lobsters on the grill, Brewskys on ice..

26:28.641 --> 26:30.016
Get this party started.

26:30.136 --> 26:31.982
We're supposed to be
treating you.

26:32.034 --> 26:33.587
It's fine,
we do this everyday.

26:35.908 --> 26:37.063
Hey, enjoy yourself.

26:46.270 --> 26:48.405
Is that it? Anything else?
-I think so.

26:50.416 --> 26:52.043
Wait, here we go.

26:53.305 --> 26:54.407
Oh shit.

26:58.022 --> 26:58.841
Cheers.

26:58.900 --> 27:00.320
Hey, thanks.

27:00.440 --> 27:01.924
To you and
your wedding.

27:02.044 --> 27:05.182
May it last at least
7 months.

27:06.727 --> 27:08.967
Come on, let's go.
Enjoy paradise, let's do it.

27:31.810 --> 27:34.154
So Kate's dad offered me a job
at his firm.

27:42.845 --> 27:43.976
Come on, man.

27:44.345 --> 27:46.527
Marky, you cannot bail
on me right now.

27:47.405 --> 27:49.535
We're finally turning a profit,
you're gonna..

27:51.221 --> 27:52.455
I haven't accept it.

27:56.465 --> 27:57.382
Right.

27:58.166 --> 27:58.980
Yet.

28:02.432 --> 28:03.579
You don't have a choice?

28:07.993 --> 28:10.090
Can we just talk about this
after the wedding please?

28:10.210 --> 28:11.295
I've just got..

28:11.332 --> 28:14.083
A hundred things going
through my head right now, and..

28:14.872 --> 28:17.393
The one thing that keeps
popping back up is..

28:23.532 --> 28:25.568
We are not coming home
with all this weed.

28:30.233 --> 28:32.660
That's one problem
i can help you with.

28:52.883 --> 28:54.199
Where are all the fish?

28:54.687 --> 28:55.826
Let's go there.

30:22.933 --> 30:24.286
What the fuck was that?

30:24.406 --> 30:26.301
Calm down, just breathe.

30:26.421 --> 30:27.653
No, get me out of here.

30:27.694 --> 30:29.046
What happened?

30:29.257 --> 30:31.123
It's a fucking graveyard
out there.

30:31.173 --> 30:32.997
Penny thinks she saw something.

30:33.047 --> 30:35.114
I saw bodyparts.

30:37.767 --> 30:39.135
Baby, relax.

30:39.255 --> 30:41.735
Probably just some fish bits
left over from a shark attack.

30:42.116 --> 30:43.750
Wait, what did you see?

30:43.870 --> 30:45.589
Shark attack?

30:52.382 --> 30:54.121
Oh God.

30:58.532 --> 31:00.701
You guys are as stone
as you look?

31:03.890 --> 31:05.655
Give me some.

31:50.851 --> 31:52.152
This shouldn't be happening.

31:52.272 --> 31:54.910
The virus is attacking
faster than before.

31:55.030 --> 31:56.711
What is that?
A vaccine?

31:56.831 --> 31:58.379
Stop thinking small..

31:58.499 --> 32:01.691
Why simply prevent a virus
from activating..

32:01.811 --> 32:04.323
If we can hunt it down
and kill it.

32:07.232 --> 32:08.445
Listen.

32:09.196 --> 32:11.207
I need you to go
talk to Porter.

32:11.239 --> 32:13.020
Keep him engaged,
can you do that?

32:13.063 --> 32:14.598
Yes.
-Thank you.

32:17.485 --> 32:19.720
Bridget, you're with me.
-Of course.

32:50.715 --> 32:52.117
What are you doing?

32:53.781 --> 32:55.962
You should have left
when i told you to.

32:57.898 --> 32:59.782
Doctor, we only have
one suit left.

32:59.902 --> 33:01.674
All the others were taken
to the bunker.

33:01.794 --> 33:04.245
Whoever administer the shot
gets the suit.

33:11.308 --> 33:12.449
You trust me?

33:14.778 --> 33:16.117
With my life.

33:16.353 --> 33:17.348
Good.

33:30.498 --> 33:32.839
You know what, it's your compassion..

33:32.959 --> 33:34.984
That makes you different
from the rest of them.

33:42.805 --> 33:44.434
Is that what this is about?

33:44.554 --> 33:46.301
Are you distracting me?
-No, no!

33:46.342 --> 33:48.232
No, they're just testing
a virus site.

33:48.352 --> 33:50.649
What?
-A virus site, that's a good thing.

33:50.932 --> 33:52.399
Maybe for you.

33:52.616 --> 33:54.940
You and i both know,
i'm never leaving this room.

33:56.242 --> 33:57.646
I will always..

33:57.766 --> 33:59.195
Be a carrier.

34:06.633 --> 34:08.275
I'm gonna die
in quarantine.

34:30.674 --> 34:32.216
Jorge, hold still.

34:33.784 --> 34:35.826
It's in. It's in.
It's okay.

34:36.505 --> 34:38.054
Give it a minute.
Give it a minute.

34:38.556 --> 34:39.694
Damnit.

34:40.302 --> 34:42.574
God damnit, get in here
and help me hold him down.

34:43.735 --> 34:47.007
No. Doctor, i don't think i..
-Get in here!

35:50.929 --> 35:52.320
No!

35:56.910 --> 35:58.343
That is what i'm talking about.

36:00.702 --> 36:02.258
Penny, you don't want no steak?

36:02.378 --> 36:03.921
Nah, she's not hungry.

36:07.649 --> 36:10.109
She's okay though, right?
-Yeah, she's fine.

36:10.153 --> 36:12.863
Just came out of the water a little amped-crash.

36:12.983 --> 36:14.767
Sleeping off the jetlag
or whatever.

36:15.659 --> 36:17.395
Josh, can you come in here?

36:18.647 --> 36:19.813
Yup!

36:22.684 --> 36:24.190
Hope she's all clean up.

36:27.425 --> 36:29.574
Daddy don't like no
salty cooch.

36:29.944 --> 36:31.835
The shits that come out your mouth.

36:32.276 --> 36:33.485
Hell yeah.

36:37.673 --> 36:39.436
How are you two related again?

36:42.013 --> 36:42.780
Hike.

36:45.814 --> 36:46.921
Hola.

36:47.334 --> 36:48.275
Close the flap.

36:48.774 --> 36:49.925
Yeah.

36:50.895 --> 36:52.521
That's what i'm talking about.

36:52.641 --> 36:54.815
I'm not..
Look at this.

36:55.235 --> 36:56.468
Oh, Jesus.

36:57.380 --> 36:59.269
Baby, i told you
to put on sun screen.

36:59.544 --> 37:00.606
I did.

37:04.990 --> 37:06.177
What is it?

37:06.380 --> 37:07.502
I don't know.

37:08.711 --> 37:10.623
are you allergic to salt water?

37:10.666 --> 37:11.897
No, i mean..

37:11.969 --> 37:14.557
Not before now.
Don't.

37:15.028 --> 37:16.447
It's like it's on fire.

37:17.975 --> 37:21.196
Baby, you're obviously very allergic
to something.

37:21.316 --> 37:24.638
But i'm gonna go get the first aid kit,
everything's gonna be okay.

37:28.697 --> 37:29.956
Look at your legs.

37:30.805 --> 37:32.217
That's how mine started.

37:33.868 --> 37:34.715
What?

37:34.947 --> 37:38.061
It's just started itching a few minutes ago
after i smoked.

37:38.937 --> 37:40.241
Did you have some bud?

37:40.361 --> 37:42.037
Yeah, before the dive.

37:42.522 --> 37:43.886
Hey..

37:44.725 --> 37:46.332
That must be what it is.

37:46.383 --> 37:50.178
We bought that stuff in somewhere,
we're having a little reaction to a different strain..

37:50.229 --> 37:51.669
Baby, it's okay.

37:51.789 --> 37:53.751
Relax, relax.

37:54.272 --> 37:57.515
Okay? Papi's gonna make it all better.

37:59.071 --> 38:00.555
You still look great.

38:05.359 --> 38:06.206
So..

38:06.438 --> 38:07.632
The guy asks his wife.

38:07.857 --> 38:08.921
He says, baby..

38:09.264 --> 38:11.942
Can you tell me something
that makes me angry..

38:12.062 --> 38:13.578
And happy at the same time?

38:14.015 --> 38:15.941
His wife thinks about it
for a second.

38:17.070 --> 38:18.262
She says, sure.

38:18.382 --> 38:20.245
You got a bigger dick
than your brother.

38:22.646 --> 38:24.123
It's terrible.
It's terrible dude.

38:24.243 --> 38:26.360
Bad attitude,
you need to lighten up.

38:26.480 --> 38:27.791
You're getting married tomorrow.

38:30.122 --> 38:31.183
Yeah, about that.

38:32.717 --> 38:34.020
Take these.

38:34.876 --> 38:36.287
Make you feel better.

38:36.407 --> 38:37.735
There you go.

38:40.508 --> 38:42.079
That a girl.

38:44.506 --> 38:47.944
You just need a little distraction
until the Benadryl kicks in.

39:00.504 --> 39:02.982
Now you, just relax.

39:03.424 --> 39:04.944
Because the doctor..

39:05.350 --> 39:06.125
Is in.

39:12.308 --> 39:13.307
Give me your leg.

39:16.249 --> 39:17.096
That's it.

39:18.141 --> 39:19.908
It feels good?
-Yeah.

39:33.669 --> 39:34.973
Just laid back.

39:35.560 --> 39:36.602
There you go.

40:41.891 --> 40:43.658
Listen, if i had a list..

40:43.716 --> 40:46.256
Kate would be checked out
in every box, but..

40:46.521 --> 40:49.445
For some reason, i think
what if there's an unfinished business out there?

40:49.894 --> 40:50.612
Like?

40:54.231 --> 40:55.656
Jesus, do they ever let up?

40:55.776 --> 40:56.785
I mean really?

41:01.055 --> 41:03.357
You remember that girl
from a few summers back?

41:04.086 --> 41:05.759
The nympho.

41:06.511 --> 41:08.888
Yeah..

41:09.460 --> 41:10.618
cucumber girl.

41:17.921 --> 41:18.565
What?

41:21.676 --> 41:23.536
No..
-Yeah.
-No.

41:23.656 --> 41:26.813
She.. You gotta be fucking..
Are you serious?

41:27.326 --> 41:29.484
Does Josh know?
-No.

41:29.803 --> 41:32.947
No and he doesn't need to know.
-Are you kidding me?

41:33.207 --> 41:34.900
Who are you all of the sudden.

41:35.020 --> 41:38.581
First you're gonna sabotage our business
of two years.

41:38.789 --> 41:40.669
And then, on top of it all..

41:40.789 --> 41:44.316
You're fucking your brother's girl?
-Hold on.

41:44.436 --> 41:46.585
Technically, he's fucking my girl.

41:46.603 --> 41:51.110
Your..
-Super secret ex-girl childhood friend..

41:51.146 --> 41:53.799
We were lab partners
all through grade 8.

41:54.089 --> 41:55.274
Right.

41:56.773 --> 41:58.501
What? We were.

42:00.754 --> 42:03.234
I can't believe
that's cucumber girl.

42:03.822 --> 42:05.234
The one with..

42:05.623 --> 42:07.541
What is so funny about that?

42:08.906 --> 42:11.232
Amazing.
A-ma-zing.

42:11.277 --> 42:13.681
That's awesome, i can't believe..

42:13.726 --> 42:17.038
Does he know?
What she can do with a cucumber..

42:17.518 --> 42:18.499
Come on.

42:20.544 --> 42:23.376
Why do i tell you
these things?

42:23.496 --> 42:26.656
That is awesome, it makes perfect sense
now i think about it.

42:26.776 --> 42:30.658
She always did like salad.
-Please do not say anything to anybody.

42:30.704 --> 42:32.676
I shouldn't have told you that.
-What do you mean?

42:32.702 --> 42:34.548
That's one of the greatest things
i've ever heard.

42:34.668 --> 42:36.479
It's dark, let's go.

42:37.985 --> 42:38.941
What did i say?

42:42.471 --> 42:44.143
Baby, you got so wet.

43:00.501 --> 43:02.672
No, she did not dude.
Give me a break.

43:02.730 --> 43:03.816
Holy fuck!

43:04.634 --> 43:05.829
Oh my god, Josh?

43:07.124 --> 43:08.799
Josh, what happened?

43:13.900 --> 43:16.340
I think Penny's sick.

43:25.039 --> 43:26.665
Mayday, mayday.

43:26.817 --> 43:28.387
Can anybody hear me?

43:29.147 --> 43:31.218
God damnit.
Come on.

43:32.586 --> 43:34.948
Come on, can anybody here me?

43:35.238 --> 43:38.358
Hello, mayday.
We have a medical situation.

43:38.417 --> 43:40.950
Can you hear me, over?
-I told you, the range is too short.

43:45.608 --> 43:46.999
I got no reception.
-Nothing?

43:47.035 --> 43:48.838
No.
-Jesus.

43:50.944 --> 43:52.549
Listen, Penny needs help now.

43:52.585 --> 43:53.852
What about the dingy?

43:53.881 --> 43:56.341
No, we won't make it for 2 miles.

43:56.377 --> 43:58.939
The phone's still won't work,
the radio's still won't work.

44:01.590 --> 44:03.812
There was a structure
on the northern side of the island.

44:04.351 --> 44:05.465
The one we saw
on the way over?

44:05.516 --> 44:08.201
Yeah, that's right.
Maybe we're not the only ones here after al.

44:09.501 --> 44:10.457
It's worth the shot.

44:11.788 --> 44:13.274
Alright, Josh.

44:13.795 --> 44:16.575
Take care of Penny
and stay in touch, alright?

44:17.060 --> 44:18.524
We're gonna go,
we'll be back soon.

44:20.203 --> 44:21.492
Okay.
-Come on.

44:25.114 --> 44:27.271
Come on babe, let's get you back
inside the tent.

44:45.337 --> 44:47.755
Where the hell is this place?
-Down here, come on.

44:48.356 --> 44:49.803
Now you got all the answers.

44:49.847 --> 44:51.630
I'm trying man,
i'm trying.

44:51.666 --> 44:53.599
It's getting dark,
we gotta go back.

44:54.236 --> 44:56.169
We're not going back.
Penny needs us.

44:56.640 --> 44:58.935
Penny needs us or
Penny needs you?

45:00.006 --> 45:01.171
What's that supposed to mean?

45:01.953 --> 45:03.697
It means that Penny..

45:03.817 --> 45:05.296
She's gonna be fine.

45:05.332 --> 45:07.982
She's with your brother,
her boyfriend.

45:10.978 --> 45:12.742
You want to go, go.

45:13.124 --> 45:15.230
Fine, go.
I'm staying here.

45:15.499 --> 45:17.620
I said i was gonna get them help,
and i'm helping them.

45:17.740 --> 45:19.288
He's my brother, man.

45:21.851 --> 45:24.554
I guess i'm just on my own now,
i should get use to that.

45:24.674 --> 45:25.739
It's your choice.

45:25.859 --> 45:28.928
Yeah, just another person getting fucked by the mighty Marcus Bentley.
-It's your choice.

45:29.048 --> 45:30.840
Do what you want, man.

45:34.935 --> 45:37.007
Mark! Marky!

45:42.896 --> 45:44.769
I found it.
-No way.

46:03.824 --> 46:05.575
Hey, how you doing?

46:07.167 --> 46:09.031
We gotta leave the island.

46:09.529 --> 46:12.713
We gotta get the dingy,
and just take a chance.

46:14.115 --> 46:16.647
Marcus and Dobbs are out there right now.

46:16.767 --> 46:18.448
Looking for help, okay?

46:19.335 --> 46:20.484
I don't care.

46:22.206 --> 46:25.816
Pen, he's my brother.
I can't just leave him behind.

46:27.438 --> 46:28.578
Why?

46:29.130 --> 46:30.569
He's leaving you.

46:39.575 --> 46:40.888
Baby, i'm..

46:41.403 --> 46:43.334
I'm gonna try the radio again.

46:43.370 --> 46:44.800
For help, outside.

46:44.845 --> 46:46.410
Don't leave me!

47:12.494 --> 47:13.706
Hello?

47:17.707 --> 47:18.720
Hello?

47:18.840 --> 47:20.230
What is that smell?

47:24.528 --> 47:25.809
Hello?

47:49.027 --> 47:49.941
Fuck!

48:06.381 --> 48:08.191
Penny, get back in the tent.

48:08.899 --> 48:10.202
It hurts.

48:10.322 --> 48:11.786
I need air.

48:13.387 --> 48:16.118
Get back in the motherfucking tent!

48:17.258 --> 48:18.959
You're such an asshole.

48:22.286 --> 48:23.906
Fuck!

48:43.335 --> 48:45.082
It's locked.

48:45.718 --> 48:48.641
If anyone's there, they obviously
don't want us getting in.

48:56.671 --> 48:58.207
Can we..

49:04.903 --> 49:06.396
God damnit.

49:17.752 --> 49:19.164
Doesn't look locked to me.

49:30.748 --> 49:31.780
Hello?

49:32.250 --> 49:34.585
I don't think it's here.

49:36.194 --> 49:37.280
Hey Josh.

49:37.400 --> 49:39.234
Josh, we're inside this
bunker type thing..

49:40.073 --> 49:43.493
We're just gonna take a look around
but it doesn't look like anyone's been here for a long time.

49:43.783 --> 49:44.977
Over.

49:45.097 --> 49:46.853
What is this place?

49:47.071 --> 49:48.437
Hey Josh?

49:48.708 --> 49:50.428
Josh, you read me?
Over.

49:51.566 --> 49:53.339
We're out of range.
-What?

49:53.459 --> 49:55.773
We're out of range.
They're not gonna hear you.

49:55.893 --> 49:57.001
Fuck.

49:57.121 --> 49:59.281
Hey Josh!
Josh!

49:59.535 --> 50:01.109
God damnit.

50:03.742 --> 50:05.416
Some of these stuff
still works.

50:05.461 --> 50:08.259
Maybe there's something we can use for communication, if i can get some of this working.

50:08.305 --> 50:10.223
I don't know man.
-I mean..

50:10.343 --> 50:12.603
I don't know any of this shit.
-There's obviously still power.

50:18.383 --> 50:19.396
Shit.

50:19.516 --> 50:22.102
I fucked up, i'm sorry.
-That's alright.

50:22.222 --> 50:23.907
I fucked up.
-It's cool.

50:24.027 --> 50:25.645
There's gotta be some release or something.

50:25.765 --> 50:27.880
I think i just broke it.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.289
Fuck, i'm sorry Marky.
-God damnit.

50:30.409 --> 50:32.650
It's alright, hey calm down!
-What are we gonna do?

50:32.770 --> 50:36.163
Calm down? There's blood on the floor.
-Don't touch it!

50:36.283 --> 50:39.321
Don't touch the blood.
-There's a lot of blood, i'm not touching.
-Don't touch anything!

50:39.403 --> 50:41.004
Nothing!
-Okay.

50:41.124 --> 50:43.809
We gotta figure this shit out.
-Okay.

50:50.206 --> 50:52.359

This is a map.

50:52.386 --> 50:55.300
This is a map. This is a map, look!
-Okay.

50:56.639 --> 50:58.205
This is us, this is us.

50:58.250 --> 51:00.494
We can go down here, we can get out.
-Are you sure?

51:00.614 --> 51:02.423
Yeah, i'm positive.

01:01:09.579 --> 01:01:10.800
Come on!

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:12.296
We gotta get out
this island.

01:01:12.316 --> 01:01:13.993
Go, go, go.
-Where?

01:01:14.113 --> 01:01:15.452
Turn left.
-Where?

01:01:15.869 --> 01:01:17.474
Stop, stop.
Left.

01:01:31.867 --> 01:01:33.225
Dobbs!

01:01:37.244 --> 01:01:38.995
Dobbs!

01:01:39.328 --> 01:01:40.822
Dobbs!

01:01:44.629 --> 01:01:46.118
Dobbs..

01:01:51.351 --> 01:01:52.427
Dobbs..

01:01:53.492 --> 01:01:54.773
Look at me.

01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:57.359
Dobbs, we have to go.

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:12.374
Dobbs!

01:05:13.509 --> 01:05:16.273
It's supposed to be safe
in here.

01:05:16.914 --> 01:05:19.499
But he got inside.

01:05:19.619 --> 01:05:21.324
He got us.

01:05:21.444 --> 01:05:22.982
What did you do
to these people?

01:05:23.102 --> 01:05:25.100
I'm in control.

01:05:25.730 --> 01:05:28.870
I can't let it out this island.
-Wait, wait.

01:05:28.924 --> 01:05:31.924
Look, i can go get help
alright?

01:05:32.044 --> 01:05:34.238
I know a great plastic surgeon.

01:05:34.662 --> 01:05:38.591
He did my ex-girlfriend.
Great job.

01:05:38.711 --> 01:05:40.384
Spectacular.

01:05:40.807 --> 01:05:42.850
Wait, wait.
No.

01:05:43.092 --> 01:05:44.699
Please, please..

01:06:35.216 --> 01:06:38.026
Hey Dobbs, calm down.
It's me.

01:06:38.146 --> 01:06:40.405
What the hell happened?
Where is Marcus?

01:07:15.811 --> 01:07:17.071
Mark..

01:07:18.507 --> 01:07:19.898
He..

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:22.701
He's gone to find help.

01:07:22.821 --> 01:07:25.332
We need to get Marcus,
get to the doctor..

01:07:25.452 --> 01:07:28.427
And get to Penny, cause she's not doing
so well, man.

01:07:32.896 --> 01:07:33.993
No.

01:07:34.113 --> 01:07:36.557
No, you stay the hell
away from me.

01:07:36.677 --> 01:07:38.908
Why?
-Stay away.

01:07:43.318 --> 01:07:45.147
Marky?
Thank God, man.

01:07:45.267 --> 01:07:46.679
Were you gonna leave me back there?

01:07:46.799 --> 01:07:49.590
No, i was coming back for you.
I wouldn't just let you down there.

01:07:49.710 --> 01:07:52.902
You locked the door.
Hey hey..

01:07:53.022 --> 01:07:55.205
Don't make me.
-You're gonna shoot me?

01:07:55.325 --> 01:07:57.903
Great bachelor party,
you're such a friend.

01:07:58.023 --> 01:08:01.303
Guys just settle down, okay?
We just need to get the doctor.

01:08:01.423 --> 01:08:04.269
He has it too, look at him.
He has it too!

01:08:05.949 --> 01:08:08.425
Who cares what i have?
They're waiting for her.

01:08:08.545 --> 01:08:12.013
Who, who's waiting for her?
-Dr Edwards, now put the gun down before i make you.

01:08:12.133 --> 01:08:15.869
Come on Marcus, we can take him.
-You think your brother gives a shit about you?

01:08:16.596 --> 01:08:18.567
He fucked your girlfriend.

01:08:18.871 --> 01:08:21.674
Right? Tell him Marky.
Tell him.

01:08:28.814 --> 01:08:31.228
It was a long time ago,
i was gonna tell you..

01:08:31.258 --> 01:08:32.857
I was just trying to protect you.

01:08:32.977 --> 01:08:34.673
You should've tried harder.

01:08:34.986 --> 01:08:37.068
I knew it,
i knew something was up.

01:08:37.188 --> 01:08:39.267
How was i suppose to know
you were gonna show up with Penny..

01:08:39.301 --> 01:08:41.770
I'm the one who's paying
for your broke ass to come down here..

01:08:41.810 --> 01:08:45.584
But not mom and dad, right?
-Guys, can we please just get out of here already?

01:08:45.618 --> 01:08:48.330
I only got enough patience for one family fuck-up at this wedding.

01:08:48.450 --> 01:08:50.629
One family fuck-up.
-You selfish fuck.

01:08:50.749 --> 01:08:53.618
You just can't wait to get the fuck out
of this family?

01:08:53.738 --> 01:08:55.710
You got damn right, damn right.

01:08:56.725 --> 01:09:00.576
Fucking hurts!
My nose!

01:09:12.009 --> 01:09:13.991
Let's get to these doctors, alright?
-Yeah.

01:09:14.111 --> 01:09:15.233
Fuck you, man.

01:09:15.353 --> 01:09:18.139
I can't go back there,
you don't know what's down there.

01:09:18.259 --> 01:09:20.649
We got no choice.

01:09:20.988 --> 01:09:23.459
You feel bad about what you did before,
here's your chance.

01:09:23.502 --> 01:09:27.309
I'm sorry, okay?
I broke my nose.

01:09:27.429 --> 01:09:28.857
It's locked, guys.

01:09:30.656 --> 01:09:32.654
It's locked, try something.

01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:34.504
You're smart,
figure it out.

01:09:35.651 --> 01:09:37.876
What do you want me to try?

01:09:37.996 --> 01:09:40.374
Okay, i'll try something.

01:09:41.321 --> 01:09:42.772
There, i tried something.

01:09:42.892 --> 01:09:45.157
Can we go now, please?
-Watch out.

01:09:49.393 --> 01:09:51.183
Hello? Dr Edwards?

01:09:51.661 --> 01:09:53.408
You don't know what can be down here.
-Hello?

01:09:54.265 --> 01:09:56.508
I don't get it.
I spoke to someone.

01:09:58.446 --> 01:10:00.218
Hello? Who are you?

01:10:00.338 --> 01:10:04.611
We have medical emergency,
Dr Edwards told us to come here.

01:10:04.731 --> 01:10:05.828
Really?

01:10:06.628 --> 01:10:08.548
Did you come by boat?
-Yeah.

01:10:10.175 --> 01:10:13.173
We have a power outage right now,
Edward is down on the ICU.

01:10:13.293 --> 01:10:15.137
He's stabilizing some patients.

01:10:15.739 --> 01:10:17.860
He wants us to go straight to the ER.

01:10:17.999 --> 01:10:20.145
I can help you as long as we move fast.
-Stop!

01:10:20.386 --> 01:10:22.054
She's lying!

01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:25.574
Don't listen to her.
She's one of our most highly contagious patient.

01:10:25.669 --> 01:10:27.653
She's the contagious one.

01:10:27.773 --> 01:10:31.502
She's carrying an extremely lethal strain of a flesh eating virus.

01:10:31.537 --> 01:10:32.771
Don't be ridiculous.

01:10:32.891 --> 01:10:35.778
If i'm gonna help you, we need to leave now.
-Show them your skin, Bridget.

01:10:35.898 --> 01:10:38.256
We're wasting time, we have to go.
-Let her talk.

01:10:38.376 --> 01:10:41.663
She's delusional.
-Listen, we don't have time for this.

01:10:50.693 --> 01:10:53.486
Show them your skin,
Bridget.

01:11:06.490 --> 01:11:08.559
No, no, no..

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:11.756
Listen to me.

01:11:12.312 --> 01:11:14.803
Take us to
Dr Edwards..

01:11:15.959 --> 01:11:17.332
Now!

01:11:18.166 --> 01:11:19.878
Josh, let's go.
Come on.

01:11:19.998 --> 01:11:21.425
It's gonna be okay.

01:11:27.934 --> 01:11:29.211
This guy.

01:11:38.949 --> 01:11:40.435
My name is Dr Edwards.

01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:44.197
There's been an incident, the rest of the staff
had been temporary removed to the evacuation tunnels..

01:11:44.250 --> 01:11:46.031
Until we can contain
this breach.

01:11:46.083 --> 01:11:48.502
No, everyone in that bunker
is dead.

01:11:48.545 --> 01:11:50.075
What?
-Are you sure?

01:11:50.195 --> 01:11:51.387
How is that possible?

01:11:53.073 --> 01:11:55.393
Dr Edwards, please.
Penny, the girl on our boat..

01:11:55.436 --> 01:11:57.522
We have to get you to her now.
-Excuse me?

01:11:58.172 --> 01:11:59.841
Didn't you respond to our
stress call?

01:11:59.961 --> 01:12:02.039
I wouldn't lower that gun.
-You don't move.

01:12:02.919 --> 01:12:05.674
He lured you here under false pretenses,
he's gonna take your boat..

01:12:05.752 --> 01:12:08.133
And he's gonna leave you behind.
-That's ridiculous.
-No.

01:12:08.564 --> 01:12:10.059
Every one of these hazmat suits..

01:12:10.179 --> 01:12:12.961
Is equipped with a small high power radio system
in the right sleeve.

01:12:13.306 --> 01:12:16.556
It's radio, it doesn't have enough power
to reach the mainland.

01:12:16.676 --> 01:12:18.616
It's tiny.
-Yeah? How about the beach?

01:12:19.309 --> 01:12:21.881
This award winning scholar
gets off the island all by himself..

01:12:22.001 --> 01:12:24.575
And no one knows
that he is responsible.

01:12:25.285 --> 01:12:27.744
You piece of shit.
-What happens to us?

01:12:27.864 --> 01:12:29.904
What happens to us?
-That's a fabrication.

01:12:29.939 --> 01:12:31.851
Very good fabrication, Porter.

01:12:31.886 --> 01:12:35.075
He'd throw anyone of you under the bus
if he thought that suit is needed, isn't that right Bridget?

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:38.931
Josh, take his gun.

01:12:39.557 --> 01:12:42.127
Wait, let's all just try
and use our heads..

01:12:42.170 --> 01:12:44.829
Just think for a second.
Just think!

01:12:45.082 --> 01:12:47.395
Did he get it from
the bunker too?

01:12:49.655 --> 01:12:52.121
We went snorkling in the beach,
that's all.

01:12:54.415 --> 01:12:55.788
Jesus Christ.

01:12:56.851 --> 01:12:58.641
Everything in that water was dead.

01:12:59.632 --> 01:13:02.291
Did you know about this?
-Of course not.

01:13:02.411 --> 01:13:03.942
This isn't my facility.

01:13:04.062 --> 01:13:07.122
Maybe there's a sanitation line that went into the ocean, maybe not.

01:13:07.242 --> 01:13:09.339
Am i suppose to know
where they keep the trash?

01:13:09.459 --> 01:13:12.128
If a virus of this magnitude
was allowed to escape..

01:13:12.172 --> 01:13:14.670
And becomes a pandemic..
-Pandemic?

01:13:15.208 --> 01:13:16.825
The guy who
created the vaccine..

01:13:16.945 --> 01:13:18.120
Will be a hero.

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:19.514
I'm not trying to
be a hero..

01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:22.399
I'm trying to save lives.
-That's why Porter's so important to you.

01:13:22.519 --> 01:13:24.338
He's the key
to the vaccine.

01:13:24.573 --> 01:13:26.111
To your legacy.

01:13:26.381 --> 01:13:29.075
We're all getting the hell out
of this place, come on.

01:13:29.195 --> 01:13:30.454
You don't understand.

01:13:30.574 --> 01:13:32.340
I don't understand?
-No, you don't understand.

01:13:32.374 --> 01:13:35.047
Listen to me,
we're getting my brother back on that boat..

01:13:35.082 --> 01:13:36.603
And we're doing it right now, okay?

01:13:36.646 --> 01:13:38.662
If the system keeps slushing
itself out..

01:13:38.782 --> 01:13:40.702
It won't be long until
it reaches mainland.

01:13:40.745 --> 01:13:42.370
We're talking about
an outbreak.

01:13:42.405 --> 01:13:44.218
On a massive scale.

01:13:45.947 --> 01:13:48.326
Please, we need to shut it down
immediately.

01:13:48.353 --> 01:13:51.863
Listen, i promise you we will send
the whole army to clean up this place..

01:13:51.889 --> 01:13:56.364
No, we don't have to wait for that,
every facility is engineered with a fail-safe scenario.

01:13:57.850 --> 01:14:00.205
Like a self destruct system?

01:14:00.753 --> 01:14:03.438
Please, we can stop this right here,
right now.

01:14:03.558 --> 01:14:04.542
Josh.

01:14:06.054 --> 01:14:08.896
Josh, josh..
You go back to the boat..

01:14:09.016 --> 01:14:11.470
You take care of Penny, she's gonna be fine.
-Okay.

01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:13.869
Wait, i'm coming with you.
I can help.

01:14:15.379 --> 01:14:16.317
Dobbs..

01:14:16.361 --> 01:14:18.142
You keep an eye on
Dr. Evil.

01:14:18.629 --> 01:14:19.712
Okay?

01:14:21.615 --> 01:14:23.032
You, let's go.

01:14:23.825 --> 01:14:25.077
Let's go.

01:14:25.389 --> 01:14:27.258
Come on, keep going.

01:14:27.458 --> 01:14:30.203
Let's go.
-Come on, don't fuck around, man!

01:14:30.323 --> 01:14:32.480
Jesus Christ!
-Let's go.

01:14:34.478 --> 01:14:35.362
Come on.

01:14:49.514 --> 01:14:52.010
If we're not back when the boat gets here,
just set sail.

01:14:52.758 --> 01:14:53.618
Marky..

01:14:53.738 --> 01:14:54.887
Marky..

01:14:56.008 --> 01:14:57.215
Listen to me.

01:14:57.335 --> 01:14:58.979
Just get Josh
somewhere safe.

01:14:59.614 --> 01:15:01.308
Hey, please.

01:15:05.256 --> 01:15:06.621
Porter.

01:15:07.081 --> 01:15:09.375
We may need your help.
-Let's go, come on.

01:15:14.795 --> 01:15:16.202
You heard him,
let's go.

01:15:20.746 --> 01:15:23.230
What can they do for us in the ER anyway?

01:15:23.263 --> 01:15:25.870
Dr Edwards has been working on a virus site.
-A what?

01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:27.442
Virus killer.

01:15:27.562 --> 01:15:31.049
If we can make it to the CDC facility in time,
they might be able to bind it.

01:15:34.374 --> 01:15:37.000
You don't look so good,
relax..

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:38.520
Breathe..

01:15:39.285 --> 01:15:40.945
Breathe, where's your boat?

01:15:41.753 --> 01:15:44.607
It's waiting for us on the beach
just over there.

01:15:58.225 --> 01:16:00.764
Wait, wait,
we can't go in there.

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:02.850
It's contaminated.

01:16:03.539 --> 01:16:04.660
It's conta..

01:16:06.928 --> 01:16:08.153
Oh God.

01:16:09.325 --> 01:16:11.862
We still have to shut down
the minor release.

01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:14.148
I'll do it.

01:16:52.010 --> 01:16:54.386
You won't be able to conceal
those hives much longer.

01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:57.671
I told you to shut up.

01:16:58.546 --> 01:17:01.849
Do you have any idea
what's the next phase of this virus is?

01:17:02.439 --> 01:17:05.998
Horrible blistering pain
as those hives weld up.

01:17:06.250 --> 01:17:10.017
Followed by fever and grotesque
postuils on your thighs..

01:17:10.044 --> 01:17:12.199
Your mid sections, your face.
And then..

01:17:12.319 --> 01:17:14.050
Your tissues start necrotizing.

01:17:15.093 --> 01:17:16.857
If you want to survive this virus..

01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:19.255
You've got to let me asses
its progress.

01:17:19.472 --> 01:17:20.601
Okay?

01:17:23.591 --> 01:17:26.203
If you try anything,
i swear i will kill you.

01:17:26.524 --> 01:17:28.193
I swear.
-Okay.

01:17:28.975 --> 01:17:29.898
Okay.

01:17:31.114 --> 01:17:32.218
Lower the gun.

01:17:33.765 --> 01:17:34.947
Put the gun down.

01:17:35.163 --> 01:17:36.866
Thank you.
This arm.

01:17:40.029 --> 01:17:42.039
Doesn't look like it's that advanced.

01:17:49.391 --> 01:17:51.616
Turns out your condition is fatal.

01:17:57.602 --> 01:17:58.749
Okay Porter.

01:17:58.869 --> 01:18:00.852
Now you have to put
this code into the keypad.

01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:03.170
Alpha.

01:18:03.466 --> 01:18:04.596
Romeo.

01:18:04.874 --> 01:18:06.073
Foxtrot.

01:18:06.193 --> 01:18:08.843
1-2-3.

01:18:12.087 --> 01:18:13.825
That's it,
it's armed.

01:18:15.368 --> 01:18:17.011
There's no turning back, is there?
-No.

01:18:18.654 --> 01:18:20.035
Come on, let's get to the beach.

01:18:20.079 --> 01:18:23.507
We have to clear the blast radius
before this place goes sky high.

01:18:44.203 --> 01:18:45.498
Who are you?

01:18:51.578 --> 01:18:53.325
I'm a doctor.

01:18:53.759 --> 01:18:55.694
I'm here to take you to the hospital.

01:18:56.068 --> 01:18:57.571
Where's Josh?

01:18:59.430 --> 01:19:00.890
You must be Penny.

01:19:01.942 --> 01:19:03.923
I already took care of Josh.

01:19:05.250 --> 01:19:07.327
I've been ordered to
transport you.

01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:09.430
By who?

01:19:12.905 --> 01:19:14.183
By who!

01:19:29.744 --> 01:19:31.957
Look, you might need a referral.

01:19:40.742 --> 01:19:42.987
Don't you fucking touch me!

01:20:10.418 --> 01:20:11.721
You're one ugly bitch.

01:23:02.174 --> 01:23:04.833
Dobbs, Edwards!
We gotta get..

01:23:07.674 --> 01:23:10.059
No, no..

01:23:21.726 --> 01:23:23.049
Josh!

01:23:41.065 --> 01:23:41.967
Josh..

01:23:42.203 --> 01:23:43.467
Josh?

01:24:08.099 --> 01:24:10.231
There's nothing you could've done.

01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:15.251
Edwards!

01:24:20.092 --> 01:24:22.729
Edwards, where are you,
you son of a bitch?

01:24:34.369 --> 01:24:36.662
You son of a bitch,
where are you?

01:24:48.443 --> 01:24:49.446
Watch out!

01:24:50.989 --> 01:24:52.809
Change of plans.
-Why?

01:24:52.929 --> 01:24:55.152
What are the two rules
of containment?

01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:56.695
Isolate the exposed..

01:24:56.815 --> 01:24:58.684
Quarantine the sick.
-Exactly.

01:24:58.726 --> 01:25:00.899
Which is why he can never leave
this island.

01:25:01.658 --> 01:25:03.765
But he's not sick!
-Really?

01:25:03.885 --> 01:25:07.146
Everyone else on his boat was contaminated.
-What about Dobbs?

01:25:07.266 --> 01:25:09.496
What about Dobbs, you killed him
not the virus.

01:25:09.530 --> 01:25:13.441
You killed him!
-I spare him from an agonizing death.

01:25:13.561 --> 01:25:15.805
You saw what was happening to
your brother.

01:25:15.852 --> 01:25:16.645
Stop!

01:25:22.832 --> 01:25:24.180
Stop!

01:25:24.631 --> 01:25:26.418
You can't do this!

01:25:26.538 --> 01:25:28.803
You need to take your emotions
out of this.

01:25:29.682 --> 01:25:33.576
I'm offering you the opportunity
of a life time.

01:25:34.005 --> 01:25:37.053
This moment could determine
your career.

01:25:38.123 --> 01:25:39.404
Your life.

01:25:41.111 --> 01:25:42.510
All you have to do..

01:25:42.630 --> 01:25:44.634
Is follow my lead.

01:25:48.486 --> 01:25:51.631
Am i the only one who has the courage
to do what's necessary?

01:25:51.751 --> 01:25:54.252
What's right?
-Porter, do something!

01:25:54.372 --> 01:25:56.869
I'm the only chance he has
of seeing his wife again.

01:26:02.094 --> 01:26:03.355
Porter.

01:26:03.475 --> 01:26:05.108
Your wife's already dead.

01:26:23.972 --> 01:26:24.992
Together..

01:26:26.265 --> 01:26:28.945
We could've stopped this virus
of its track.

01:26:30.507 --> 01:26:33.440
You think your immunity can protect you?

01:26:34.853 --> 01:26:35.856
That you're..

01:26:39.416 --> 01:26:41.279
That you're some sort of god?

01:26:49.028 --> 01:26:50.275
You're nothing but a..

01:26:51.439 --> 01:26:52.678
Rat.

01:26:52.881 --> 01:26:54.305
A sinking ship.

01:27:10.925 --> 01:27:12.281
You know, doctor?

01:27:14.362 --> 01:27:17.278
Sometimes it's necessary
to harm one..

01:27:18.260 --> 01:27:20.418
In hopes of saving millions.

01:28:09.539 --> 01:28:11.098
What happened to your friends?

01:28:36.646 --> 01:28:38.668
I thought you guys
could use a drink.

01:28:41.471 --> 01:28:43.219
Any luck with the radio?

01:28:43.339 --> 01:28:45.337
No, we should be in radio range soon.

01:28:47.675 --> 01:28:49.453
I'm gonna get some fresh air.

01:28:58.056 --> 01:28:59.594
To think..

01:28:59.994 --> 01:29:02.309
All because of a little mouse.

01:29:02.429 --> 01:29:03.816
What?

01:29:04.869 --> 01:29:07.534
At the bunker,
the pictures.

01:29:07.654 --> 01:29:09.824
Photos,
whole bunch of them.

01:29:09.944 --> 01:29:12.574
They traced it back
to a mouse.

01:29:13.101 --> 01:29:15.018
That's what it looks like
anyway.

01:29:23.783 --> 01:29:25.100
Porter.

01:29:28.292 --> 01:29:30.918
Porter..
-What about Porter?

01:29:31.677 --> 01:29:35.238
Three blind mice,
three blind mice.

01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:40.765
Oh my God.
-Wait, what is going on here?

01:29:41.249 --> 01:29:42.448
Porter..

01:29:42.568 --> 01:29:45.051
Oh my God, the water.
-What water?

01:30:29.821 --> 01:30:31.233
Captain Maggio?

01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:34.014
Captain Maggio?

01:30:37.343 --> 01:30:38.660
Oh God.

01:30:46.505 --> 01:30:47.738
Shit.

01:30:50.713 --> 01:30:52.756
Why would he want to
infect us?

01:30:55.106 --> 01:30:57.814
We're the only ones left
who know who he is.

01:31:00.037 --> 01:31:02.766
How much water did you drink?

01:31:04.230 --> 01:31:06.316
How much water did you drink?

01:31:06.436 --> 01:31:07.759
Oh God.

01:31:08.486 --> 01:31:09.916
Oh no.

01:31:10.864 --> 01:31:12.107
No.

01:31:17.537 --> 01:31:19.265
The dingy, where's the dingy?

01:31:19.385 --> 01:31:20.824
Porter took it.

01:31:21.646 --> 01:31:23.016
He's gone!

01:31:24.991 --> 01:31:26.814
Porter!

01:31:29.226 --> 01:31:30.601
Porter!

01:33:18.230 --> 01:33:22.098
Where are you located,
and what's the nature of your medical emergency?

01:34:17.895 --> 01:34:24.638
