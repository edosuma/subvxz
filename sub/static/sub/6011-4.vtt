00:55.960 --> 00:57.840
Why didn't you wait for me?

00:57.880 --> 01:01.240
I wanted to finish these before
breakfast. Is it something I've done?

01:01.280 --> 01:03.200
No, not anything.

01:03.240 --> 01:05.239
Nobody's done anything.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.880
Blimey. What happened to you?

01:11.920 --> 01:14.200
Leave her alone. I fell. I cut my
lip.

01:15.920 --> 01:19.640
Now, if either of you need help to
carry things down just ask.

01:19.680 --> 01:22.680
Alfred and James will be glad to
help. That's good to know.

01:22.720 --> 01:25.040
What was that, James? Nothing, Mr
Carson.

01:26.760 --> 01:29.200
I'd better go up. Lady Mary hasn't
rung yet.

01:29.240 --> 01:31.240
I've things to do.

01:31.560 --> 01:34.840
How was Anna when you lent her that
dress last night?

01:35.640 --> 01:38.880
How should she be? She told me she'd
fallen and cut her lip,

01:38.920 --> 01:41.360
but I wondered if it might be more
serious.

01:41.400 --> 01:45.560
She always minimises things. I'm sure
I don't know anything you don't know.

01:49.480 --> 01:52.240
What's the matter with everyone this
merry morn?

01:52.280 --> 01:56.480
I think there's something rather foreign
about high spirits at breakfast.

01:56.960 --> 02:00.080
I shall be supervising the departure
if anyone wants me.

02:10.600 --> 02:13.800
Well, Mr Gillingham, I hope you
haven't forgotten anything.

02:13.840 --> 02:17.720
On the contrary, Mr Carson. I shall
remember this visit for a long time.

02:17.760 --> 02:21.640
Goodbye, Lord Grantham, and thank
you for everything. Oh, nonsense.

02:21.680 --> 02:23.800
I'm the one who should be thanking
you.

02:24.600 --> 02:27.120
You look as if you're glad to see
the back of us.

02:27.560 --> 02:29.960
No. You've been kind to me.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.200
I'm afraid I haven't been much fun
to be with.

02:32.240 --> 02:36.800
Grief's odd, Tom. When the Duke died
it made me terribly clumsy.

02:36.840 --> 02:38.920
I kept dropping and breaking things.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.760
It was because it felt disloyal...

02:42.280 --> 02:45.440
to manage anything properly without
him, do you see?

02:46.000 --> 02:48.800
But you could manage. Yes, I could.

02:49.960 --> 02:52.840
And so can you. I wonder.

02:52.880 --> 02:56.960
The trouble is that I'm not really out
and all that. But it should be possible.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.040
I don't think people care about those
rules like they used to. Well, I don't.

03:06.200 --> 03:08.200
The luggage is loaded, m'lord.

03:10.640 --> 03:13.080
It's nice to see you're well looked
after.

03:13.280 --> 03:16.200
It seems rather ungrateful, but I
can't pretend I like him.

03:16.960 --> 03:18.920
But I'm lucky to have anyone
nowadays.

03:18.960 --> 03:20.560
You said it.

03:20.600 --> 03:23.800
I'll say goodbye to Tony Gillingham.
Don't interrupt them yet.

03:25.440 --> 03:27.440
You're sure we can't meet?

03:28.440 --> 03:31.720
I'm sure you're much too busy and
I'll be chasing my tail.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.600
In other words, no.

03:34.880 --> 03:38.320
I'm afraid you'll have to get
started. They won't hold the train.

03:38.360 --> 03:40.280
Not even for you?

03:41.000 --> 03:44.440
Not for me, nor for you either,
Duchess. Not these days.

04:02.760 --> 04:04.760
You look very earnest.

04:04.800 --> 04:08.560
I'm on my way to convince the board
of the merits of an out clinic,

04:08.600 --> 04:10.720
so people can come early for
treatment.

04:10.760 --> 04:13.240
I don't suppose... Don't suppose
what?

04:13.280 --> 04:17.600
I could do with some help. I know you suspect
me of trying to get you back into harness.

04:17.640 --> 04:21.399
But, well, it would leave a nurse
free for other duties.

04:21.440 --> 04:23.440
I'll think about it.

04:26.840 --> 04:28.800
I will.

04:28.840 --> 04:30.840
I promise.

04:33.320 --> 04:37.640
The tax people have had a cancellation,
so they can see us on Wednesday at noon.

04:37.680 --> 04:41.040
But we should go up tomorrow. I
wouldn't like to risk being late.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.960
And you don't want me to come? No
point in you all going.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
Are you afraid I might put the case
for selling? It's not a question of that.

04:48.040 --> 04:50.720
They don't care how they get the
money so long as they get it.

04:50.760 --> 04:54.320
I'll ask how long they can give us and
what scale of payment they'll accept.

04:54.360 --> 04:57.720
Then I'll report back. And we'll make
a decision together.

04:57.760 --> 04:59.760
But I will try to persuade you.

04:59.800 --> 05:03.680
Even though you'd be dragging a debt
behind you for 20 years? I don't care.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.520
Not if Downton is self-sufficient by
the end of it.

05:06.920 --> 05:10.240
I can see I'll spend the rest of my
life paying by instalments.

05:10.280 --> 05:14.280
Papa, you always say we're not the
owners of Downton but the caretakers.

05:14.320 --> 05:16.320
Very well. Let's take care of it.

05:17.800 --> 05:19.800
Aunt Rosamund said we can stay with
her.

05:19.840 --> 05:22.480
Do you mind keeping an eye on the
children, Mama?

05:22.520 --> 05:25.040
Is this London? When are you going?
Can I come?

05:25.360 --> 05:28.120
Tomorrow, and I don't see why not.
Nor me.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.960
Will you meet Tony Gillingham while
you're there?

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
I don't think so. Why should I?

05:34.520 --> 05:36.520
Just thought you might.

05:36.560 --> 05:39.280
Don't be transparent, Mama. It
doesn't suit you.

05:42.400 --> 05:44.520
I thought you might come down to see
me.

05:46.840 --> 05:49.000
After last night. Look, Edna,

05:49.040 --> 05:51.880
I blush to admit it, but I was very
drunk.

05:51.920 --> 05:54.400
So you're not going to deny it? Of
course not.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
And if I behaved badly, I am sorry.

05:57.040 --> 06:00.560
We'll have to put it down to our low
spirits and self indulgence.

06:00.880 --> 06:04.160
I suppose you're so cold because
you're ashamed of what you did.

06:04.200 --> 06:06.440
I'm neither cold nor ashamed. But,
as I say,

06:06.880 --> 06:08.880
if I made a mistake, then I'm sorry.

06:09.520 --> 06:11.520
I dare say we both are.

06:15.960 --> 06:19.160
What are you making
there? Feuilletes.

06:19.200 --> 06:21.920
What's that? Puff pastry layers with
asparagus.

06:21.960 --> 06:26.440
I'm doing the hollandaise. Do they really like
that stuff or do they order it to show off?

06:26.480 --> 06:29.200
We don't all have to live off
battered fish and meat pies.

06:29.240 --> 06:32.800
It's the first thing Mrs Patmore's
trusted me with. First big thing.

06:32.840 --> 06:35.080
I'm quite nervous. So you should be.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.880
Mess it up and it's back to
kindergarten.

06:41.920 --> 06:43.920
What are you doing?

06:45.040 --> 06:47.120
You can't treat a poor girl like
this.

06:47.160 --> 06:51.320
Like what? To use her one minute and
to cast her aside the next.

06:51.800 --> 06:54.680
I've said I'm sorry - Yes, you're
sorry. I know.

06:56.280 --> 06:58.280
But suppose I'm pregnant.

06:59.600 --> 07:01.600
What will you do then?

07:01.640 --> 07:05.440
Don't be ridiculous. You can't be
pregnant. It's not as easy as that.

07:05.480 --> 07:07.480
But it is. Just as easy.

07:08.920 --> 07:11.440
Why talk about it now? You won't
know for weeks.

07:11.480 --> 07:14.880
I must be sure that you'll marry me
if I'm carrying your child.

07:16.040 --> 07:19.920
I need to know that you won't cast
me off, that you'll be a man of honour.

07:21.160 --> 07:23.000
And don't say I'm not good enough.

07:23.840 --> 07:28.680
If you were good enough for Lady
Sybil Crawley, I'm good enough for
you. Don't speak her name.

07:32.280 --> 07:34.280
You weren't so severe last night.

07:38.280 --> 07:41.720
All I need is your word that you'll
marry me if there's a baby.

07:44.240 --> 07:49.160
Don't worry. If it happens, I mean
to make a go of being your wife.

07:50.360 --> 07:52.360
I won't hold you back.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.400
You won't have any regrets.

07:56.280 --> 07:58.280
I am already full of regrets.

08:00.200 --> 08:02.200
There is nothing but regret in me.

08:19.440 --> 08:21.880
Did you enjoy the concert? I did.

08:22.520 --> 08:25.400
It was a great treat to hear Melba in
person.

08:25.440 --> 08:28.640
Hm. And the evening generally?

08:30.840 --> 08:34.400
You mean did I find it hard to see
Mary come alive again?

08:35.600 --> 08:37.600
Yes, I did, I confess it.

08:38.720 --> 08:42.080
But I don't think my feelings are at
all defensible.

08:42.600 --> 08:45.480
They are defensible to me. But it's
immoral

08:45.520 --> 08:48.040
to react in such a jealous and
selfish way.

08:48.080 --> 08:51.040
Well, if we only had moral thoughts,

08:51.080 --> 08:53.680
what would the poor churchmen find
to do?

08:54.160 --> 08:56.120
I'm fond of Mary.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.760
I love her.

08:57.800 --> 09:00.000
I don't want her to be alone and
unhappy.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.040
It makes no sense, even to me.

09:02.560 --> 09:06.040
I don't criticise either you or her.

09:07.240 --> 09:10.560
But I hope you find a way to make
friends with the world again.

09:14.080 --> 09:17.360
When we get to London, would you mind
helping Lady Rose?

09:17.400 --> 09:19.400
We can't take Madge off Lady Edith.

09:23.280 --> 09:25.520
Anna, are you all right? Yes.

09:27.680 --> 09:29.680
Only you've been very quiet.

09:32.560 --> 09:34.560
Will that be all, m'lady?

09:35.360 --> 09:38.160
Yes, I suppose so. Very good, m'lady.

09:44.360 --> 09:46.360
I telephoned Rosamund.

09:46.400 --> 09:49.840
I thought Mary was doing that. Yes,
but I wanted to speak to her.

09:49.880 --> 09:52.600
That's a first. She'll give a little
dinner.

09:52.640 --> 09:56.240
What about Tom? She said she won't
mind if he wants to be included.

09:56.280 --> 09:58.280
Who could resist such a love call?

09:58.320 --> 10:01.440
She'll ask that young man for Rose,
so it won't be too obvious.

10:01.480 --> 10:05.080
It'll be pretty obvious. Do you
think something might come of it?

10:05.120 --> 10:07.520
Probably not but I wouldn't mind if
it did.

10:07.560 --> 10:10.520
After all, being a family means
welcoming new members.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.560
Don't you agree, Braithwaite?

10:12.960 --> 10:16.320
I think anyone would be lucky to be
a part of this family, m'lady.

10:16.360 --> 10:18.520
That's nice. Thank you.

10:18.840 --> 10:23.160
Aren't we encouraging a nation of
hypochondriacs if they rush to a
doctor at every twinge?

10:23.200 --> 10:27.440
I think it encourages people to look after
themselves and not become a burden.

10:27.480 --> 10:29.640
So you mean to help? A little.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.880
Just to provide some free labour. No
more than that.

10:32.920 --> 10:35.760
I wish someone would provide me with
some free labour. Oh.

10:35.800 --> 10:37.800
Lloyd George would never allow it.

10:39.440 --> 10:43.120
Rosamund is so looking forward to
seeing you. Poor Aunt Rosamund.

10:43.160 --> 10:45.760
We use her like an hotel.
She enjoys it.

10:45.800 --> 10:48.120
It gives her a surrogate real life.

10:48.160 --> 10:50.680
What do you think, Tom? Do you think
she minds?

10:51.800 --> 10:53.800
Tom?

10:56.640 --> 10:58.640
I'm sorry. What were you saying?

10:58.680 --> 11:01.080
I'd far rather know what you were
thinking.

11:09.040 --> 11:11.360
Let me taste it. Go on, then.

11:16.040 --> 11:18.000
It's like eating paper. Thank you.

11:18.040 --> 11:20.760
I mean it. Do you really care about
this stuff?

11:20.800 --> 11:23.160
I want to be a good cook. I want a
skill.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.400
Why shouldn't I? You sound like
Alfred.

11:25.440 --> 11:27.760
Well, what do you want?

11:27.800 --> 11:30.320
To have a good time. To see the
world.

11:30.360 --> 11:33.760
To meet beautiful women and spend
money and drink champagne.

11:33.800 --> 11:35.800
You can't make a career out of that.

11:36.120 --> 11:38.720
Some people do. I want a life that's
fun.

11:38.760 --> 11:40.760
I wish I was more like you.

11:41.560 --> 11:43.560
I should report you to Mrs Patmore.

11:44.240 --> 11:46.240
Report me for what? You know.

11:46.280 --> 11:49.160
No, he does not know and nor do I.
What don't you know?

11:50.160 --> 11:52.520
Why everyone's making a fuss over my
cooking.

11:52.560 --> 11:55.080
Because you did well, Ivy. They're
not very hard.

11:55.120 --> 11:58.480
They're hard enough for a beginner,
as you ought to remember.

11:58.520 --> 12:01.280
Yes, but Ivy moves so fast for a
beginner, don't she?

12:05.160 --> 12:08.640
Just one night. We'll be back for
dinner on Wednesday.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.800
I'll miss you. Don't.

12:13.520 --> 12:15.520
I'm sorry.

12:16.080 --> 12:18.080
I'm just tired.

12:19.160 --> 12:22.880
Before you ask, you've done nothing
wrong. I must have done something.

12:24.400 --> 12:28.280
You won't talk to me, you won't look
at me. I can't come near you.

12:28.800 --> 12:30.800
We're in each other's pockets.

12:31.280 --> 12:33.280
We live together, we work together.

12:34.560 --> 12:36.720
Sometimes I think it's just too much.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.760
There's not a lot to say.

12:40.320 --> 12:42.800
We worked in a few theatres
together.

12:42.840 --> 12:45.680
She had a singing act with her
sister.

12:45.720 --> 12:48.000
The Lark and the Dove they were
called.

12:48.360 --> 12:51.240
Which was she? The dove, I suppose.

12:51.680 --> 12:53.680
Her sister had the voice...

12:54.280 --> 12:56.680
but Alice was a gentle soul,

12:57.920 --> 12:59.920
a sweet and a gentle soul.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.240
And you were courting?

13:02.280 --> 13:04.880
Well, you know how it was then.

13:05.200 --> 13:08.880
Not like today. You were lucky if
you got to walk them to the corner.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.600
But you wanted to marry her.

13:14.120 --> 13:16.320
So much I could taste it.

13:17.480 --> 13:21.760
I know, where is that young man now
so full of passion?

13:22.680 --> 13:25.920
Anyway, she chose Charlie and that
was that.

13:26.320 --> 13:28.320
But what's changed?

13:28.960 --> 13:30.960
He told me that she regretted it.

13:31.360 --> 13:33.360
That she wished she'd chosen me.

13:34.480 --> 13:38.320
She's dead now, so it doesn't
matter, but that's what she said.

13:39.080 --> 13:41.480
I disagree. It matters a lot.

13:42.280 --> 13:45.520
The woman you loved... loved you.

13:46.280 --> 13:48.280
But it doesn't change anything.

13:48.520 --> 13:50.640
It changes you from where I'm
looking.

13:55.520 --> 13:57.920
You're busy. No, no, no.

13:58.840 --> 14:01.760
I'll say goodnight. Goodnight, Mr
Carson.

14:06.720 --> 14:08.720
What is it?

14:08.760 --> 14:11.480
When I get back from London I want to
move back upstairs.

14:12.080 --> 14:15.080
What? Why, for heaven's sake?

14:15.120 --> 14:17.120
Because I can't...

14:18.600 --> 14:20.600
..I can't let him touch me.

14:21.560 --> 14:25.280
But whatever happened was not Mr
Bates's fault, surely?

14:25.320 --> 14:27.320
Of course not.

14:27.720 --> 14:30.000
He is without fault and that's the
point.

14:30.360 --> 14:32.360
I'm not good enough for him. Not now.

14:32.400 --> 14:35.480
Why say that? Because I think that
somehow I...

14:36.800 --> 14:38.800
..I must have made it happen.

14:38.840 --> 14:42.560
Stuff and nonsense. You were
attacked by an evil, violent man.

14:42.600 --> 14:45.240
There is no sin in that. But I feel
dirty.

14:45.680 --> 14:48.400
I can't let him touch me because I'm
soiled.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.920
Anna, I've been thinking.

14:51.520 --> 14:54.040
We must go to the police. No.

14:55.400 --> 14:58.320
But suppose you're with child. What
will you do then?

14:59.320 --> 15:02.000
I'll kill myself. I won't listen to
that.

15:03.080 --> 15:06.320
No man should be able to do what he
did and get away with it.

15:06.720 --> 15:08.800
And when Mr Bates has killed him,

15:08.840 --> 15:12.160
will you come with me to the prison
when my husband is hanged?

15:13.080 --> 15:16.200
But the poor man's heart is breaking
for not knowing.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.880
Better a broken heart than a broken
neck.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.400
So can I have a room, please?

15:29.320 --> 15:30.840
You can.

15:31.400 --> 15:34.920
You must wait until there's some
reason for you to give Mr Bates,

15:34.960 --> 15:38.920
but I wish you would decide that
honesty is the best policy.

15:41.160 --> 15:44.640
In the meanwhile, try to take a
break from it...

15:45.800 --> 15:47.800
..while you're in London.

15:51.640 --> 15:53.640
There can be no break from it.

16:04.360 --> 16:08.640
Come and talk to me while I'm cleaning
them. I've got work to do. Five minutes.

16:20.560 --> 16:24.520
Ivy can make the savoury. There's
only three of them, it'll be good practice.

16:24.560 --> 16:28.800
What about me? Collect the trays
from the nursery and make the
pancakes for pudding.

16:28.840 --> 16:31.200
Put them in the steam warmer. Have
you seen this?

16:31.240 --> 16:34.840
What? They're setting up a training
school at the Ritz Hotel in London

16:34.880 --> 16:36.760
in honour of Monsieur Escoffier.

16:37.720 --> 16:40.920
Just for a few candidates. How much
will it cost? Nothing.

16:40.960 --> 16:45.720
If they pass the test they get free training,
a basic wage and the chance of a job after.

16:46.160 --> 16:49.400
They have two examinations a year.
You could do that, Daisy.

16:49.440 --> 16:52.640
Are you trying to get rid of me?
Where's Ivy? She ought to see it.

16:52.680 --> 16:54.680
She's around here somewhere.

16:56.520 --> 16:58.520
She's in the boot room.

17:25.119 --> 17:27.920
Sorry to keep you waiting, but Anna
couldn't find -

17:28.720 --> 17:30.520
Oh.

17:30.560 --> 17:32.960
I hope I'm a surprise and not a
shock.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.800
Well, you're certainly unexpected.

17:37.160 --> 17:40.240
I thought I'd get up a small party,
just an informal one.

17:40.480 --> 17:42.480
You remember Sir John Bullock?

17:42.520 --> 17:45.200
He and Lord Gillingham have just been
staying with us.

17:45.240 --> 17:49.400
Cora said it had been a success.
How clever of you both to be free at
such short notice.

17:49.440 --> 17:51.360
They brought your message to my
club.

17:51.400 --> 17:55.520
I had an evening of cards and whisky
ahead so it was a welcome change of plan.

17:56.600 --> 18:00.280
And what about you? Well, I cancelled
what I was supposed to be doing.

18:00.960 --> 18:02.960
I hope Miss Lane Fox didn't mind.

18:04.120 --> 18:06.600
Don't punish me for wanting to see
you again.

18:06.640 --> 18:09.720
John's got a marvellous idea for
later on, haven't you?

18:09.760 --> 18:13.520
After dinner I could take you all to
hear the new band at the Lotus Club.

18:13.560 --> 18:16.800
You and Mary can be my chaperones, so
what could be more proper?

18:16.840 --> 18:20.440
It isn't too jazzy, Lady Rosamund.
Just a club with a good dance band.

18:20.480 --> 18:22.480
We can keep the young in order.

18:22.520 --> 18:24.840
That's if you like the sound of it.

18:24.880 --> 18:26.880

fun.

18:30.680 --> 18:32.680
What about you, Tom?

18:33.680 --> 18:37.880
I'll stay here with Lady Rosamund.
Oh, I was thinking I might go, too.

18:37.920 --> 18:41.680
That settles it. Tom can come as
Aunt Rosamund's partner.

18:42.560 --> 18:44.560
Well?

18:44.600 --> 18:46.600
I give in.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.800
Some more champagne over here. I
don't need any more.

train as you.

28:20.196 --> 28:22.156

to you in a railway carriage

else listening.

28:30.836 --> 28:33.516

may.

explanation at some stage.

28:43.316 --> 28:45.316
It's not complicated.

28:45.356 --> 28:48.076
I have made a long journey to ask a
short question.

28:50.916 --> 28:52.916
Will you marry me?

28:56.076 --> 28:57.956
Tony, you don't know me.

28:57.996 --> 29:01.276
How can you say that? We've known
each other since we were children.

29:01.316 --> 29:03.916
Yes, but with a very long gap in the
middle.

29:04.516 --> 29:06.516
We only met properly a few days ago

29:06.556 --> 29:09.636
and now you want to spend the rest of
your life with me?

29:10.516 --> 29:12.516
Yes.

29:12.556 --> 29:14.556
That's exactly what I want.

29:15.676 --> 29:18.876
I love you, Mary, and there must be
a way to convince you.

29:21.836 --> 29:25.796
Ah, James, could you bring us some
tea?

29:26.156 --> 29:28.156
Very good, m'lady.

29:35.076 --> 29:36.876
Look,

29:36.916 --> 29:39.956
I never met Matthew but I'm sure he
was a splendid chap.

29:39.996 --> 29:43.476
He was. But he's dead and I'm alive.

29:45.756 --> 29:47.756
We're good together, Mary.

29:47.796 --> 29:50.156
We could be so very happy if you'd
let us.

29:52.916 --> 29:54.756
And Miss Lane Fox?

29:55.876 --> 29:57.916
I like Mabel... a lot.

29:58.356 --> 30:00.716
I even think that I could come to
love her.

30:00.756 --> 30:03.676
But I'm not in love with her as I am
with you.

30:05.356 --> 30:07.356
You fill my brain.

30:07.396 --> 30:09.236
I see you when I close my eyes.

30:09.276 --> 30:11.396
I can't stop thinking about you -

30:12.476 --> 30:14.476
where you are, what you're doing.

30:15.796 --> 30:18.836
You're very persuasive. Then be
persuaded.

30:19.956 --> 30:21.956
I only wish I could.

30:22.316 --> 30:24.156
Not now, if you don't want to.

30:25.436 --> 30:27.436
You take as long as you need -

30:27.876 --> 30:29.876
two years, three.

30:31.316 --> 30:34.196
Just so long as I know that you'll
marry me in the end.

30:36.996 --> 30:41.036
Tony! Why on earth are you here? Did
you leave something behind?

30:41.076 --> 30:44.316
No, I had some business nearby, so I
thought I'd look in.

30:44.356 --> 30:46.796
Are you staying? Er, yes, if, if you
don't mind.

30:46.836 --> 30:49.356
I brought a bag on the off chance.
And your man?

30:49.836 --> 30:52.516
I didn't want to make a fuss. It's
only one night.

30:55.476 --> 30:58.756
I can't stay much longer. Nanny's
bringing down Sybbie in a moment.

30:58.796 --> 31:00.876
It won't take long. She's coming
now.

31:08.076 --> 31:09.796
I see.

31:09.836 --> 31:11.836
What do you see?

31:11.876 --> 31:13.876
Well, I know now why you sent for
me.

31:14.556 --> 31:17.516
You're going to gang up on me and
try to pay me off.

31:18.396 --> 31:20.396
Why would we pay you off?

31:22.716 --> 31:24.716
Well, if I'm pregnant.

31:25.796 --> 31:29.476
I want my baby to have a father and
I won't change my mind about that,

31:29.516 --> 31:31.676
however much you offer.

31:31.716 --> 31:33.716
I wasn't planning to make an offer.

31:34.276 --> 31:36.276
Because there is no child.

31:36.636 --> 31:38.636
What? You can't know that.

31:38.956 --> 31:41.596
Nobody can. But I do know that,
actually.

31:42.316 --> 31:44.316
Edna's not pregnant.

31:44.356 --> 31:48.436
Do you think she would have let herself
get pregnant before she was sure of you?

31:48.836 --> 31:50.836
And she knew how to prevent it.

31:51.796 --> 31:55.036
Why else would you buy this book of
instructions?

31:55.956 --> 31:58.436
Marie Stopes. Married Love.

31:58.476 --> 32:01.596
Though in your case it was unmarried
love, wasn't it, dear?

32:01.636 --> 32:05.876
You've been through my things. What if I'd
agreed to marry her and there was no baby?

32:05.916 --> 32:08.516
Once you'd agreed she would have got
pregnant.

32:09.036 --> 32:12.636
I don't know whom she would have
selected as the father,

32:12.676 --> 32:14.876
but no doubt she had a candidate in
mind.

32:16.636 --> 32:19.476
What proof have you got? Oh, none at
the moment.

32:19.916 --> 32:21.916
But if you persist in your lie

32:21.956 --> 32:24.636
I'll summon the doctor and have him
examine you.

32:25.556 --> 32:27.756
You can't force me. Oh, yes, I can.

32:28.356 --> 32:30.916
I'll lock you in this room and when
he's arrived

32:30.956 --> 32:34.196
I'll tear off your clothes and hold
you down, if that's what it takes.

32:36.396 --> 32:38.956
You can't stop me from speaking to
her ladyship.

32:39.916 --> 32:41.916
No, you're right.

32:42.356 --> 32:44.356
That I cannot do.

32:44.956 --> 32:46.956
But if you want a reference...

32:47.396 --> 32:51.836
or another job during your natural
lifetime, you'll hold your tongue.

32:53.756 --> 32:55.756
This is yours, I think.

33:01.356 --> 33:04.796
But even with the book, how did you
know she wasn't pregnant?

33:04.836 --> 33:08.676
I didn't. And the doctor couldn't
have told a thing yet, either.

33:09.676 --> 33:11.676
But at least we know the truth now.

33:16.276 --> 33:18.356
What's the matter with you? Never
mind.

33:18.396 --> 33:21.116
I thought we were all about to be
dancing to your tune.

33:21.156 --> 33:24.196
Do you ever wonder why people
dislike you so much?

33:25.436 --> 33:28.796
It's because you are sly and oily
and smug.

33:28.836 --> 33:31.916
And I'm really pleased I got the
chance to tell you before I go.

33:31.956 --> 33:34.076
Well, if we're playing the truth
game,

33:34.596 --> 33:36.796
then you're a manipulative little
witch,

33:36.836 --> 33:39.716
and if your schemes have come to
nothing, I'm delighted.

33:41.396 --> 33:44.236
Are you leaving Downton then? What's
it to you?

33:44.516 --> 33:46.516
Oh, plenty.

33:46.556 --> 33:48.556
It's plenty to me.

33:55.556 --> 33:57.556
You won't believe what's happened.

33:57.596 --> 34:00.516
Braithwaite's handed in her notice.
What? Why?

34:00.556 --> 34:02.796
Family troubles. Or so she says.

34:03.156 --> 34:07.676
Are we living under a curse, doomed to
lose our lady's maids at regular intervals?

34:07.716 --> 34:09.716
Anna, did you know about this?

34:11.556 --> 34:13.556
Is anything the matter?

34:14.196 --> 34:17.076
No, m'lord. You seem very quiet
lately.

34:17.116 --> 34:19.116
I hope Bates is behaving himself.

34:19.556 --> 34:21.835
He never does anything else.

34:22.956 --> 34:25.356
Will that be all, m'lady? Yes, thank
you.

34:26.036 --> 34:30.036
Did they tell you Tony Gillingham's
asked himself for the night? They have.

34:31.275 --> 34:33.396
We must try not to read too much
into it.

34:34.636 --> 34:36.716
Why are you in your rompers?

34:36.755 --> 34:38.835
Tony only brought black tie.

34:38.876 --> 34:41.755
He didn't think we'd be changing if
no-one was staying.

34:41.795 --> 34:44.396
So another brick is pulled from the
wall.

34:45.835 --> 34:48.235
Why is Lord Gillingham back so soon?

34:48.275 --> 34:50.716
That's the big question. But we're
very glad he is.

34:51.636 --> 34:53.636
Not all of us, I imagine.

34:53.676 --> 34:58.156
Are you ready to go? Carson says the
car's outside. Oh, yes, I think so.

34:58.196 --> 35:02.196
So, you're off in the morning? I am.
Pity we didn't get Edith to wait a day.

35:02.236 --> 35:04.236
Why did she go to London, anyway?

35:04.276 --> 35:06.756
I asked but she assumed an air of
mystery.

35:06.796 --> 35:09.996
Honestly, Papa. Edith's about as
mysterious as a bucket.

35:10.036 --> 35:11.836
She's gone to see Michael Gregson.

35:11.876 --> 35:15.556
Ooh, that's the next thing to look
forward to. I don't dislike him.

35:15.916 --> 35:17.916
Oh, what a recommendation.

35:18.556 --> 35:20.476
Goodnight, dear. Goodnight, Granny.

35:20.516 --> 35:24.636
Goodnight, Lord Gillingham.
Goodnight. Goodnight, Isobel.
Goodnight.

35:27.196 --> 35:29.196
Goodnight, Lord Gillingham.

35:29.236 --> 35:32.836
I hope we see you up here again
before too long. I hope so, too.

35:37.356 --> 35:39.796
That was nobly done. Mm-hm.

35:39.836 --> 35:41.836
She is a good woman

35:41.876 --> 35:44.756
and, while the phrase is enough to
set one's teeth on edge,

35:44.796 --> 35:48.676
there are moments when her virtue
demands admiration.

35:48.956 --> 35:52.396
I agree, although I'm rather
surprised to hear you say it.

35:52.876 --> 35:54.876
Not as surprised as I am.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.356
Ah, Monk's left the coffee.

36:00.396 --> 36:02.396
He's cleared off till the morning.

36:02.436 --> 36:06.316
Does that mean we have to do the
washing up? No, he'll do that tomorrow.

36:06.996 --> 36:09.796
He comes back at eight. That's quite
a discipline.

36:10.316 --> 36:12.196
Why do you say that?

36:12.236 --> 36:14.636
It reminds me of Lady Warwick

36:14.676 --> 36:16.996
having the stable bell at Easton
rung at six,

36:17.036 --> 36:21.356
so everyone had to time to get to the right
beds before the maids and valets arrived.

36:21.396 --> 36:24.076
Isn't that apocryphal? No, actually.

36:24.396 --> 36:27.516
Papa and Mama stayed there once and
said it was quite true.

36:28.556 --> 36:31.356
Of course they already were in the
right bed.

36:33.516 --> 36:36.036
I don't know why I said all that. I
hope I do.

36:37.516 --> 36:39.516
Don't be silly.

36:39.556 --> 36:41.716
Will you miss me? Of course.

36:43.756 --> 36:46.156
Is it really only a week until you
leave? Mm.

36:46.996 --> 36:50.796
Is there anything I can do to keep
things running whilst you're in Munich?

36:50.836 --> 36:54.316
Well, as a matter of fact I've got
something I want you to sign.

36:54.876 --> 36:57.836
It will give you some authority over
my affairs.

36:57.876 --> 36:59.876
Come here.

37:08.356 --> 37:10.356
What'll you do when you get there?

37:11.036 --> 37:12.956
Well, I thought I'd write a novel.

37:12.996 --> 37:16.476
Or try to. I always fancied myself a
novelist and never had the time.

37:16.516 --> 37:18.516
Now I've got nothing but.

37:18.556 --> 37:20.836
How long is it going to take? I'm
not sure.

37:22.076 --> 37:24.356
I'll set the wheels in motion when I
arrive

37:24.396 --> 37:26.716
and we'll stop when and if we hit a
rock.

37:26.756 --> 37:28.876
But the lawyers are quite
optimistic.

37:28.916 --> 37:31.236
I thought lawyers were never
optimistic.

37:31.276 --> 37:33.276
That's why it's a good sign.

37:35.196 --> 37:37.196
Are we going out tonight?

37:37.676 --> 37:40.596
Rose was talking about the new band
at the Lotus Club.

37:40.636 --> 37:44.036
Hm. Well, no, I hadn't planned on
going anywhere.

37:45.236 --> 37:46.836
No?

37:47.156 --> 37:48.756
No.

37:56.396 --> 37:58.396
Michael, I... Oh, my darling.

38:16.298 --> 38:19.258
So I can move back in? Edna's room
will be empty now

38:19.298 --> 38:23.098
and if I'm to dress her ladyship and
Lady Mary, I think it makes sense.

38:26.458 --> 38:28.458
If that's what you really want.

38:33.098 --> 38:35.978
I'm sorry it didn't work out with
Miss Braithwaite.

38:36.018 --> 38:38.258
Not that I care much for her.

38:38.298 --> 38:41.018
I'm sorry about the disruption for
her ladyship.

38:41.618 --> 38:45.138
One day I'll tell you the whole
story. Then you'll be less sorry.

38:46.178 --> 38:49.978
The truth is we were mad as hatters
to let her back in the house.

38:52.938 --> 38:54.938
I've got a present for you.

38:59.498 --> 39:01.498
It's for your desk.

39:03.658 --> 39:05.658
What made you think of that?

39:06.418 --> 39:09.298
It's good for you to be reminded you
once had a heart.

39:09.618 --> 39:12.978
And it'll reassure the staff to know
you belong to the human race.

39:14.618 --> 39:16.618
This frame looks expensive.

39:19.058 --> 39:21.058
She was pretty though, wasn't she?

39:21.458 --> 39:23.618
She was. Very pretty.

39:24.058 --> 39:26.058
And I'm sure she was very nice.

39:26.338 --> 39:28.818
And now you can look at that and
remember her.

39:31.698 --> 39:34.018
You're right, Mrs Hughes. I will.

39:34.956 --> 39:37.956
The business of life is the
acquisition of memories.

39:39.196 --> 39:41.196
In the end that's all there is.

39:42.996 --> 39:44.996
Thank you.

39:49.796 --> 39:52.916
Bates, do you know anything about
why Braithwaite left?

39:52.956 --> 39:54.956
I don't, m'lord.

39:54.996 --> 39:57.116
They say she had some troubles at
home.

39:57.596 --> 39:59.596
I hope it's not too much for Anna.

40:04.436 --> 40:06.436
Bates?

40:07.596 --> 40:10.436
She wants to move back into the
house, m'lord.

40:11.636 --> 40:15.036
She says she needs to if she is to
perform her duties properly.

40:15.836 --> 40:17.836
Is something wrong between you?

40:20.156 --> 40:22.156
Yes.

40:23.396 --> 40:25.396
But I don't know what it is.

40:26.036 --> 40:28.676
She says it's nothing I've done but
I can't believe that.

40:28.716 --> 40:31.516
It must be my fault because she is
incapable of fault.

40:34.196 --> 40:36.196
I don't know what to do.

40:36.236 --> 40:39.956
There is no such thing as a marriage
between two intelligent people

40:39.996 --> 40:42.996
that does not sometimes have to
negotiate thin ice.

40:43.036 --> 40:45.036
I know.

40:45.076 --> 40:47.156
You must wait until things become
clear.

40:47.196 --> 40:49.196
And they will.

40:49.836 --> 40:51.716
The damage cannot be irreparable

40:51.756 --> 40:54.476
when a man and a woman love each
other as much as you do.

40:56.956 --> 40:59.676
My goodness, that was strong talk
for an Englishman.

41:20.036 --> 41:22.476
I don't really want to go back
to London,

41:22.516 --> 41:24.516
but I suppose I have to. Hm.

41:25.676 --> 41:27.876
That's after I get your answer, that
is.

41:27.916 --> 41:31.236
I was wondering how long it would
take you to get to the point.

41:32.836 --> 41:34.836
Are you ready?

41:35.916 --> 41:37.916
What happens if I refuse?

41:38.436 --> 41:40.436
We both know I must marry.

41:40.716 --> 41:44.196
I don't need to explain to you how
the system we're trapped in works.

41:44.716 --> 41:46.716
Please, don't rush into anything.

41:47.796 --> 41:50.636
I won't make a fool of Mabel. It
wouldn't be fair.

41:51.676 --> 41:55.996
I'd break up with her for you and I will
credit her by saying that she'd understand.

41:57.516 --> 41:59.436
She sounds rather fine.

42:02.316 --> 42:04.316
If you don't want me then...

42:04.876 --> 42:07.356
I think I'm honour-bound to go
through with it.

42:16.756 --> 42:18.756
It's no good, Tony.

42:19.716 --> 42:21.716
I can't.

42:22.156 --> 42:24.156
I'm not free of him.

42:25.196 --> 42:28.636
Yesterday you said I fill your
brain.

42:29.596 --> 42:33.196
Well, Matthew fills mine.

42:34.476 --> 42:36.076
Still.

42:37.436 --> 42:39.436
And I don't want to be without him.

42:40.516 --> 42:42.516
Not yet.

42:55.276 --> 42:57.276
Can I ask one favour?

42:59.316 --> 43:01.916
And then I really will go and leave
you in peace.

43:03.036 --> 43:05.876
What is it? Will you kiss me?

43:08.596 --> 43:10.196
Please.

43:10.596 --> 43:13.396
I will never love again as I love
you in this moment.

43:15.676 --> 43:17.796
And I must have something to
remember.

43:40.556 --> 43:42.556
Goodbye, Mary.

43:43.396 --> 43:45.396
My darling Mary.

43:46.396 --> 43:49.116
My prayers go with you for
everything that you do.

44:02.956 --> 44:04.956
May I have a word, your lordship?
Hm.

44:04.996 --> 44:07.076
If Miss Braithwaite is not coming
back,

44:07.116 --> 44:10.316
I wondered if her replacement had
been decided on. Not yet.

44:10.356 --> 44:15.236
I have a candidate I'd like to put forward who I
know very well and is more than qualified.

44:15.276 --> 44:18.356
You must discuss it with her
ladyship but I've no objection.

44:18.396 --> 44:21.796
She's a little older than Miss
Braithwaite. That won't hurt.

44:21.836 --> 44:24.676
Why do you say that? No reason.

44:25.516 --> 44:29.036
Where's Tony? Has he gone? He
thought he'd said all his goodbyes

44:29.076 --> 44:31.436
and he wanted to catch the half past
nine.

44:31.476 --> 44:33.796
Are you ready? Where are you going?

44:34.196 --> 44:36.716
York. For estimates to re-equip the
saw mill.

44:37.276 --> 44:39.916
So, will we be seeing Tony
Gillingham again?

44:40.716 --> 44:42.716
I'm sure we will... eventually.

44:44.556 --> 44:46.876
He was telling me about Mabel Lane
Fox.

44:46.916 --> 44:49.116
Apparently, they're getting engaged.

44:49.636 --> 44:51.956
I imagine he'll be very taken up
with that.

44:52.676 --> 44:54.676
Yes, I dare say.

44:55.476 --> 44:57.476
Right, I'll get my hat.

45:05.876 --> 45:07.716
There you are.

45:07.756 --> 45:09.516
Well, you don't look too bad.

45:09.556 --> 45:12.276
I thought you might be a little the
worse for wear.

45:12.316 --> 45:15.356
Why should I be? After only two
hours' sleep.

45:16.356 --> 45:21.436
My maid saw you come in. Aren't you
going to tell me what kept you out
until six in the morning?

45:22.516 --> 45:24.516
Well, we...

45:25.036 --> 45:28.316
Please don't say you were talking
and you lost track of time.

45:28.356 --> 45:31.716
Quite apart from the morality - or
lack of it in this situation -

45:31.756 --> 45:34.076
you do realise you are taking a
great risk?

45:34.876 --> 45:38.556
You're trusting this man with your
name and your reputation.

45:39.756 --> 45:42.076
He wants to marry me. Of course I
trust him.

45:42.116 --> 45:44.196
As you trusted Sir Anthony Strallan?

45:46.756 --> 45:48.836
That was rather unkind.

45:51.796 --> 45:53.796
Are you going to tell Mama?

45:54.876 --> 45:56.836
No.

45:56.876 --> 45:59.836
You're a grown woman and I'm not a
spy.

46:01.196 --> 46:03.796
But you're gambling with your
future, my dear.

46:04.196 --> 46:05.916
Be under no illusions.

46:05.956 --> 46:10.076
A lot may be changing, but some
things will stay the same.

46:11.556 --> 46:14.236
I'm not a bit sorry. No, you don't
look sorry.

46:14.876 --> 46:18.516
But you may find yourself feeling
very sorry later.

46:29.916 --> 46:32.796
You seem more cheerful than you were
in London. I am.

46:33.236 --> 46:36.316
I took your advice. I talked it over
and I'm off the hook.

46:37.276 --> 46:39.276
So whatever it was, it's gone away?

46:39.316 --> 46:41.396
I think so.

46:41.436 --> 46:43.436
I envy you.

46:43.476 --> 46:44.996
Why?

46:45.036 --> 46:48.956
Because I've just done something which
I have a sneaking fear I may regret...

46:49.516 --> 46:51.516
for a long time to come.

47:07.916 --> 47:10.956
My life is perfect and then, in the
space of one day, it is nothing.

47:10.996 --> 47:13.036
Good morning, Miss Baxter. Hello, Mr
Bates.

47:13.076 --> 47:15.076
What do you make of her? She's nice.

47:15.116 --> 47:18.716
How are you getting on with her
ladyship? That is so considerate.

47:18.756 --> 47:21.476
She'll be eating out of your hand.
That's the intention.

47:21.516 --> 47:25.076
You owe your place to Mrs Crawley.
She would not let me go until I'd promised.

47:25.116 --> 47:28.996
You make me sound very fervent. Wars
have been waged with less fervour.

47:29.036 --> 47:32.116
His forebears have been tenants
since the reign of George III.

47:32.156 --> 47:34.556
Be that as it may the rent's not
been paid for ages.

47:34.596 --> 47:37.737
We gave your father a long time. You
want to farm the land yourself.
