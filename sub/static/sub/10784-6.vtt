00:01.250 --> 00:03.000
Announcer: PREVIOUSLY ON
DAWSON'S CREEK...

00:03.000 --> 00:04.834
I'M WAY TOO PREGNANT
TO BE DIGGING
UNDERNEATH YOUR BED.

00:04.834 --> 00:06.375
SO STAY OUT OF MY ROOM.

00:06.375 --> 00:09.333
DO YOU OBJECT TO
THE FACT THAT I'M BLACK
AND SHE'S WHITE,

00:09.333 --> 00:12.166
OR THAT WE'RE UNMARRIED
AND ABOUT TO HAVE
A CHILD IN SIN?

00:12.166 --> 00:14.500
THAT CHILD WILL BE
IDENTIFIED AS DIFFERENT.

00:14.500 --> 00:19.041
PART BLACK, PART WHITE,
THIS CHILD WILL BE
100% LOVED.

00:19.041 --> 00:20.500
THIS CAN'T
HAPPEN AGAIN.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.000
FROM NOW ON,
OUR RELATIONSHIP

00:22.000 --> 00:23.667
IS STRICTLY
TEACHER-STUDENT.

00:23.667 --> 00:26.667
IF YOU COULD DO
ANY ONE THING RIGHT NOW,
WHAT WOULD IT BE?

00:28.500 --> 00:30.000
YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO END THIS.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.458
IT'S GETTING
TOO DANGEROUS.

00:39.500 --> 00:42.083
ALL RIGHT. GREAT MOVIE.
THANKS A LOT.

00:42.083 --> 00:43.375
I GOT TO GO.

00:43.375 --> 00:45.125
YO, JO, SLOW DOWN.
WHAT'S THE RUSH?

00:45.125 --> 00:47.708
HATE TO CUT
THE FESTIVITIES SHORT,
BUT BESSIE'S DUE NEXT WEEK,

00:47.708 --> 00:49.000
AND SHE NEEDS EXTRA HELP
AROUND THE HOUSE.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.166
COME ON, JO. BODIE CAN
TAKE CARE OF ANYTHING
THAT BESSIE NEEDS.

00:52.166 --> 00:54.125
PLUS, YOU CAN'T
LEAVE NOW. WE'VE ONLY
WATCHED ONE MOVIE.

00:54.125 --> 00:56.000
WE NEVER WATCH
JUST ONE MOVIE
ON MOVIE NIGHT.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.041
WELL, FIRST TIME
FOR EVERYTHING.

00:58.041 --> 01:00.542
A NIGHT OF FIRSTS
ALL AROUND.

01:00.542 --> 01:03.417
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

01:03.417 --> 01:05.000
I'M TALKING
ABOUT THE OBVIOUS,

01:05.000 --> 01:06.708
WHICH I KNOW WE'VE ALL
TRIED OUR BEST TO IGNORE,

01:06.708 --> 01:07.750
BUT IT'S EASY TO SEE

01:07.750 --> 01:10.333
THAT I'VE INTRUDED ON
A VERY PERSONAL RITUAL HERE,

01:10.333 --> 01:12.500
AND CLEARLY, MY PRESENCE
IS MAKING YOU UNCOMFORTABLE,

01:12.500 --> 01:13.875
SO I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

01:13.875 --> 01:16.208
JOEY, YOU STAY AND WATCH
ANOTHER MOVIE. I'LL JUST GO.

01:16.208 --> 01:17.542
JEN, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.

01:17.542 --> 01:19.166
NO, IT'S OK.

01:19.166 --> 01:21.917
I MEAN, YOU AND I HAVE
DECIDED TO SLOW THINGS DOWN,

01:21.917 --> 01:24.583
SO I'M SURE THAT A FEW HOURS
APART WON'T KILL US.

01:24.583 --> 01:26.583
BESIDES, GRAMS HAS KIND
OF BEEN ON THE WARPATH,

01:26.583 --> 01:29.208
MEANING, ONCE SHE
SEES JOEY LEAVE,

01:29.208 --> 01:31.583
THERE'S NO WAY SHE'S GOING
TO TRUST YOU AND I ALONE,
SO--SO I SHOULD GO.

01:31.583 --> 01:33.417
DON'T LEAVE ON MY ACCOUNT.

01:33.417 --> 01:35.750
I MEAN, I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN RUINING ANYONE'S EVENING.

01:35.750 --> 01:37.125
NO. NO, IT'S
NOT YOU AT ALL.

01:37.125 --> 01:39.208
DON'T TAKE IT
PERSONALLY.

01:39.208 --> 01:41.750
GREAT! SETTLED. NEXT ISSUE,
WHAT TO WATCH.

01:41.750 --> 01:43.208
THIS IS NO
SOLUTION, JOEY.

01:43.208 --> 01:45.708
IF WE BOTH STAY,
WE'RE GOING TO BE
STUCK IN THE SAME

01:45.708 --> 01:47.625
UNCOMFORTABLE
POSITION WE'VE
BEEN IN ALL NIGHT.

01:47.625 --> 01:49.458
ALL RIGHT.
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

01:49.458 --> 01:51.750
MOVIE NIGHT HAS BEEN
REDUCED TO THE FOLLOWING.

01:51.750 --> 01:52.708
YOU CAN'T STAY
IF SHE LEAVES,

01:52.708 --> 01:54.583
BECAUSE YOUR GRANDMOTHER
WOULDN'T PERMIT IT.

01:54.583 --> 01:56.792
AND YOU CAN'T STAY
IF SHE STAYS BECAUSE
IT'S AWKWARD.

01:56.792 --> 01:58.250
YEAH.

01:58.250 --> 01:59.750
AND YOU CAN'T STAY
IF SHE LEAVES,

01:59.750 --> 02:01.750
BECAUSE YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU'VE DRIVEN HER AWAY.

02:01.750 --> 02:03.208
AND YOU CAN'T STAY
IF SHE'S HERE,

02:03.208 --> 02:05.041
BECAUSE IT RUINS
MOVIE NIGHT FOR YOU.

02:05.041 --> 02:06.083
WELL PUT.

02:07.083 --> 02:08.458
SINCE THIS IS MY HOUSE,

02:08.458 --> 02:10.583
WE ASSUME THAT
I CAN'T GO ANYWHERE.

02:10.583 --> 02:13.083
ACCORDING TO MY
CALCULATIONS, THAT
ONLY LEAVES ONE OPTION.

02:13.083 --> 02:14.250
GOOD NIGHT, DAWSON.
GOOD NIGHT, DAWSON.

02:14.250 --> 02:15.792
WAIT A MINUTE.

02:15.792 --> 02:17.917
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

02:17.917 --> 02:20.500
DON'T STAY UP TOO LATE.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.250
MOVIE NIGHT...

02:22.250 --> 02:24.333
WAY TOO COMPLICATED.

03:24.291 --> 03:25.708
Bodie:
GOOD MORNING, SWEETHEART.

03:27.333 --> 03:29.250
AND HOW ARE WE FEELING
THIS MORNING?

03:29.250 --> 03:32.542
WELL, IF YOU'RE
NAUSEOUS AND SWOLLEN
AND IRRITABLE, ALSO,

03:32.542 --> 03:34.708
I'D SAY WE'RE
FEELING EXACTLY
THE SAME WAY.

03:34.708 --> 03:36.542
WELL, LOOK
AT THE BRIGHT SIDE.

03:36.542 --> 03:37.792
YOUR DUE DATE'S THE 22nd.

03:37.792 --> 03:39.917
IN LESS THAN A WEEK,
THIS WILL ALL BE OVER.

03:39.917 --> 03:43.041
A WEEK? THIS CANNOT
LAST ANOTHER WEEK.
IT'S INHUMANE.

03:43.041 --> 03:43.875
I DON'T SLEEP ANYMORE.

03:43.875 --> 03:46.333
MY LEGS ARE FAT.
MY BACK IS KILLING ME.

03:46.333 --> 03:48.875
I FEEL LIKE RETCHING
23 HOURS A DAY.

03:48.875 --> 03:51.041
DO YOU KNOW THE AVERAGE
GESTATION PERIOD
FOR THE FRUIT BAT

03:51.041 --> 03:52.375
IS 2 MONTHS?

03:52.375 --> 03:54.875
2 MONTHS. THAT'S FAIR.
THAT'S REASONABLE.

03:54.875 --> 03:57.166
WHY CAN'T I GIVE BIRTH
TO A FRUIT BAT?

03:57.166 --> 03:59.750
BECAUSE WE'RE ABOUT
80% SURE YOU'RE HUMAN.

03:59.750 --> 04:01.542
DO YOU STILL LIVE HERE?

04:01.542 --> 04:04.000
UNFORTUNATELY.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.125
WHEN'S YOUR INTERVIEW?

04:05.125 --> 04:06.375
TODAY AFTER WORK.

04:06.375 --> 04:08.708
THAT NEW FRENCH RESTAURANT
OVER IN HYANNIS.

04:08.708 --> 04:10.083
IF YOU DON'T
LIKE IT HERE, JOEY,

04:10.083 --> 04:11.959
NO ONE'S STOPPING YOU
FROM MOVING OUT.

04:11.959 --> 04:14.250
IN MOST STATES,
YOU'D BE CONSIDERED
AN ADULT.

04:14.250 --> 04:17.458
OH, THAT'S FUNNY,
'CAUSE YOU WOULDN'T.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.041
BODIE.

04:19.041 --> 04:21.583
COME ON, JOEY.
YOUR SISTER ISN'T
FEELING VERY WELL TODAY.

04:21.583 --> 04:23.959
HOW ABOUT TAKING IT
EASY ON HER, OK?

04:26.875 --> 04:29.875
LOOK, I KNOW THE MATRIARCH'S
BEEN A HANDFUL LATELY,

04:29.875 --> 04:31.583
BUT SHE'S DUE NEXT WEEK.

04:31.583 --> 04:34.125
ONCE THE BABY COMES,
I PROMISE SHE'LL BE BACK
TO HER OLD SELF AGAIN.

04:34.125 --> 04:36.041
BUT THAT'S WHAT
I'M AFRAID OF.

04:44.250 --> 04:46.750
WHAT, IN HEAVEN'S NAME,
IS THIS?

04:46.750 --> 04:48.875
IT'S A CALENDAR, GRAMS.

04:48.875 --> 04:50.083
IT'S A FILTHY CALENDAR.

04:50.083 --> 04:52.625
NO. IT'S AN ART CALENDAR.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.125
BEFORE YOU GET
APOPLECTIC ON ME,

04:54.125 --> 04:55.792
THESE PHOTOGRAPHS
HAPPEN TO BE HANGING

04:55.792 --> 04:57.667
IN SOME OF THE WORLD'S
FINEST ART GALLERIES.

04:57.667 --> 04:59.166
I DON'T CARE
WHO'S HANGING THEM.

04:59.166 --> 05:01.083
IN MY HOUSE,
WE DON'T OGLE NAKED MEN.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.041
NO. WE PRAY
TO THEM, RIGHT?

05:03.500 --> 05:06.250
DON'T YOU DARE
COMPARE THE TWO!

05:06.250 --> 05:10.125
OH, MY LORD.
JENNIFER, WHAT HAS
HAPPENED TO YOU,

05:10.125 --> 05:11.750
TO THE LITTLE GIRL
I USED TO KNOW,

05:11.750 --> 05:13.291
WHO I TOOK
TO SUNDAY SCHOOL

05:13.291 --> 05:14.959
WHEN SHE WOULD COME
VISIT ME EACH SUMMER

05:14.959 --> 05:18.458
AND WHO ONCE SHOWED
RESPECT FOR THE CHURCH
AND ITS TEACHINGS?

05:18.458 --> 05:20.917
WELL, SHE'S
CAREFULLY CONSIDERED
ALL POSSIBLE SCENARIOS

05:20.917 --> 05:22.291
DETAILING
A GOD-LIKE SOURCE,

05:22.291 --> 05:24.750
AND SHE'S FOUND THEM
UNCONVINCING,

05:24.750 --> 05:27.458
AND WHILE SHE RESPECTS THOSE
WHO CHOOSE TO BELIEVE
IN A HIGHER BEING,

05:27.458 --> 05:28.750
SHE HERSELF DOES NOT.

05:28.750 --> 05:30.875
SIMPLY PUT, GRAMS,
SHE GREW UP.

05:30.875 --> 05:32.291
PERHAPS.

05:32.291 --> 05:34.125
PERHAPS SHE JUST
THINKS SHE DID.

05:38.500 --> 05:41.125
I THINK WE SHOULD
GO OUT THIS WEEKEND,
JUST YOU AND ME.

05:41.125 --> 05:42.333
WE USUALLY DO, PACEY.

05:42.333 --> 05:45.291
NO, WE DON'T GO OUT.
WE STAY IN.

05:45.291 --> 05:47.667
WE FIRST INVENT
SOME SCHOOL-RELATED REASON

05:47.667 --> 05:49.834
WHY I NEED TO COME
OVER TO YOUR PLACE
ON A FRIDAY NIGHT,

05:49.834 --> 05:52.458
AND THEN WE LOCK THE DOORS
AND CLOSE THE BLINDS

05:52.458 --> 05:55.041
SO THAT NONE
OF THE TOWNSFOLK COULD
POSSIBLY SEE US TOGETHER.

05:55.041 --> 05:57.166
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE HAVING
TROUBLE ACKNOWLEDGING

05:57.166 --> 05:58.667
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE
A RELATIONSHIP,

05:58.667 --> 06:01.000
BUT YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,
THERE'S SOMETHING
GOING ON HERE.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.041
YES, THERE IS
SOMETHING.

06:03.041 --> 06:04.417
RIGHT. SO YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:04.417 --> 06:06.041
I THINK WE SHOULD
START ACTING LIKE IT.

06:06.041 --> 06:07.542
GOING OUT IN PUBLIC
TOGETHER.

06:07.542 --> 06:09.166
IT'LL BE GREAT,
LIKE A REAL COUPLE.

06:09.166 --> 06:11.667
PACEY, THAT'S SWEET,
BUT IT'S HARDLY
PRACTICAL.

06:11.667 --> 06:13.166
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
IN CAPESIDE.

06:13.166 --> 06:15.208
WE CAN GO DOWN
TO PROVIDENCE, OK?

06:15.208 --> 06:17.041
WE'LL HAVE DINNER,
CATCH A MOVIE.

06:17.041 --> 06:18.667
NOBODY KNOWS US
DOWN THERE.

06:18.667 --> 06:21.166
WE'LL BE JUST LIKE
ALL THE REST OF
THE DYSFUNCTIONAL COUPLES

06:21.166 --> 06:22.875
OUT FOR A GOOD TIME
ON SATURDAY NIGHT.

06:22.875 --> 06:24.917
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

06:24.917 --> 06:26.458
WILL YOU GO OUT
WITH ME, MISS JACOBS?

06:29.583 --> 06:31.333
SHE SAID SHE'D GO
TO PROVIDENCE WITH YOU?

06:31.333 --> 06:32.834
WELL,
SHE DIDN'T SAY YES,

06:32.834 --> 06:34.000
BUT SHE DIDN'T
SAY NO, EITHER.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.083
SHE GAVE ME THAT

06:36.083 --> 06:38.250
"I REALLY WANT TO,
PACEY,
BUT I JUST CAN'T" LOOK.

06:40.083 --> 06:41.375
THE WAY
I GOT THIS FIGURED,

06:41.375 --> 06:42.875
ONCE I GET
MY LEARNER'S PERMIT,

06:42.875 --> 06:44.542
THIS WOMAN'S GOING
TO CAVE COMPLETELY.

06:48.333 --> 06:49.333
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:49.333 --> 06:50.708
WELL, YOU KNOW,

06:50.708 --> 06:53.166
YOU REALLY
CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL
WITH THIS INFORMATION.

06:53.166 --> 06:55.041
I REALLY FEEL
FOR YOU, PACE,

06:55.041 --> 06:57.542
SPENDING YOUR TIME
TRYING TO GET MISS JACOBS
OUT  OF THE BEDROOM.

06:57.542 --> 07:00.375
LISTEN,
THIS RELATIONSHIP IS
NOT ALL ABOUT SEX, OK?

07:00.375 --> 07:02.208
I MEAN, LUCKILY FOR ME,
SOME OF IT IS.

07:02.208 --> 07:03.917
[BELL RINGS]
I BETTER GET GOING.

07:03.917 --> 07:06.917
I DON'T WANT YOUR GIRLFRIEND
TO THINK I'M STANDING HER UP.

07:06.917 --> 07:08.583
HEY DUDE, YOU GOTTA
BE CAREFUL TOO.

07:08.583 --> 07:09.417
DON'T WORRY.

07:10.917 --> 07:12.583
[COUGHING]

07:12.583 --> 07:13.250
OH, MAN!

07:15.166 --> 07:16.250
OK. IT WASN'T EASY,

07:16.250 --> 07:17.917
BUT I THINK I MAY HAVE
FINALLY FOUND

07:17.917 --> 07:19.750
AN UPSIDE TO MY PARENTS'
MARITAL WOES.

07:19.750 --> 07:21.917
MITCH AND GALE
ARE OFF TO COUPLES'
THERAPY THIS WEEKEND.

07:21.917 --> 07:24.166
THEY'VE LEFT LEERY MANOR
IN MY SOLE POSSESSION,
SO--

07:24.166 --> 07:25.875
THAT'S NICE
AND EVERYTHING, BUT--

07:25.875 --> 07:28.291
I WAS HOPING
FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE
MORE ILLICIT THAN THAT.

07:28.291 --> 07:30.792
THERE'S THIS KIND
OF WEIRD PACEY RUMOR
GOING AROUND SCHOOL.

07:30.792 --> 07:31.959
HAVE YOU HEARD THIS?

07:31.959 --> 07:34.583
THAT HE FINALLY
HANDED A HOMEWORK
ASSIGNMENT IN ON TIME?

07:34.583 --> 07:36.417
NOT EXACTLY, AND IT'S NOT
JUST ABOUT PACEY.

07:36.417 --> 07:38.125
IT ALSO INVOLVES
MISS JACOBS.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.792
WHAT ABOUT THEM?

07:39.792 --> 07:41.959
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
THAT FOR A STUDENT
AND TEACHER,

07:41.959 --> 07:44.166
THEY HAVE
AN EXCEPTIONALLY
CLOSE RELATIONSHIP,

07:44.166 --> 07:48.000
SO CLOSE, IN FACT,
IT'S CONSIDERED ILLEGAL
IN ABOUT 35 STATES.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.792
MAYBE WE CAN STILL
NIP THIS IN THE BUD.
WHO TOLD YOU?

07:50.792 --> 07:53.083
THE QUESTION SHOULD BE
WHO DIDN'T TELL ME, DAWSON.

07:53.083 --> 07:55.166
IT'S OUT THERE.
IT'S PREVALENT.

07:56.750 --> 07:57.792
WE GOT TO FIND PACEY.

07:57.792 --> 07:59.750
DAWSON, IS IT TRUE?

08:01.125 --> 08:02.583
DAWSON--

08:02.583 --> 08:03.792
I CAN NEVER LIE TO YOU.

08:03.792 --> 08:06.375
I TOLD YOU THAT BEFORE,
SO DO ME A FAVOR.

08:06.375 --> 08:08.333
PRETEND YOU NEVER
ASKED ME THAT QUESTION.

08:11.834 --> 08:14.000
YOU GUYS AREN'T
GOING TO BELIEVE
WHAT I JUST HEARD.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.250
SOMEHOW I THINK I WILL.

08:17.291 --> 08:18.208
HEY!

08:36.457 --> 08:38.792
OK, JOEY SAID SHE HEARD
THAT KENNY LEAVERTON

08:38.792 --> 08:41.457
WAS SMOKING
IN ONE OF THE STALLS,
OVERHEARD EVERYTHING.

08:41.457 --> 08:43.833
THAT FIGURES.
MY LIFE'S BEEN GOING
A LITTLE TOO WELL LATELY.

08:43.833 --> 08:45.458
SOMETHING HAD
TO BALANCE THAT OUT.

08:45.458 --> 08:47.125
COME ON, PACE.
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

08:47.125 --> 08:48.834
I REALLY APPRECIATE
THAT EFFORT, DAWSON,

08:48.834 --> 08:50.667
BUT IT REALLY IS
THAT BAD.

08:50.667 --> 08:52.500
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S BE HONEST.
IT'S WORSE.

08:52.500 --> 08:53.792
THIS IS CATACLYSMIC.

08:53.792 --> 08:55.792
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE
RARE MILESTONE EVENTS

08:55.792 --> 08:57.542
THAT SEPARATES THE FIRST
HALF OF YOUR LIFE

08:57.542 --> 08:59.500
FROM EVERYTHING
THAT FOLLOWS.

08:59.500 --> 09:02.750
MY ONLY CONSOLATION
IS THE FAINT HOPE

09:02.750 --> 09:04.250
THAT THIS DOES NOT
REACH TAMARA.

09:04.250 --> 09:06.500
SO, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU WOULD JUST
ALLOW ME A MOMENT HERE

09:06.500 --> 09:08.708
TO SYMBOLICALLY DROP
MY CHIN INTO MY CHEST

09:08.708 --> 09:10.458
AND FEEL REALLY, REALLY
SORRY FOR MYSELF,

09:10.458 --> 09:11.667
IT'D BE MUCH
APPRECIATED.

09:11.667 --> 09:13.875
OK. LOOK, PACEY,
GRANTED THIS IS NOT GOOD,

09:13.875 --> 09:16.125

18:57.834 --> 18:59.750
STANDARD
KING JAMES EDITION--

18:59.750 --> 19:01.000
OLD AND NEW TESTAMENT.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.083
THOUGH I AM PARTIAL
TO THE LATER CHAPTERS.

19:03.083 --> 19:05.000
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M PARTIAL TO, GRAMS?

19:05.000 --> 19:06.959
I'M PARTIAL TO PEOPLE
WHO RESPECT MY PRIVACY

19:06.959 --> 19:09.291
AND THE RIGHT I HAVE
TO MY OWN BELIEFS.

19:09.291 --> 19:12.291
AND I KNOW THAT ATHEISM
IS ABOUT THE LEAST
DESIRABLE TRAIT

19:12.291 --> 19:14.708
ANY GRANDDAUGHTER OF YOURS
COULD EVER POSSESS,

19:14.708 --> 19:16.333
BUT IT'S NOTHING
YOU SHOULD TAKE PERSONALLY.

19:17.667 --> 19:19.458
AND IT'S NOT JUST GOD,
EITHER, GRAMS.

19:19.458 --> 19:22.500
I DON'T HAVE
A WHOLE LOT OF FAITH
IN MAN THESE DAYS.

19:22.500 --> 19:23.583
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

19:26.917 --> 19:29.834
LOOK, I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE ME
OR APPROVE OF MY FAMILY,

19:29.834 --> 19:31.667
AND I KNOW YOU CAN THINK
OF AT LEAST 80 REASONS

19:31.667 --> 19:34.000
WHY BESSIE AND BODIE
ARE THE WORST KINDS
OF SINNERS,

19:34.000 --> 19:37.458
BUT RIGHT NOW, AS WE SPEAK,
MY SISTER IS SITTING
NEXT DOOR IN DAWSON'S HOUSE,

19:37.458 --> 19:39.875
INCHES AWAY FROM GIVING BIRTH,
AND OF THOSE 80 REASONS,

19:39.875 --> 19:42.500
I CAN'T THINK OF ANY
THAT THE BABY'S ACTUALLY
RESPONSIBLE FOR,

19:42.500 --> 19:46.166
IF YOU COULD REMEMBER THAT
AS A NURSE YOU TOOK AN OATH
TO HELP OTHERS IN NEED...

19:46.166 --> 19:48.500
IT'D BE REALLY NICE.

20:02.625 --> 20:04.000
GREAT.

20:05.417 --> 20:06.333
SO...

20:08.000 --> 20:08.834
LISTEN TO THIS.

20:11.166 --> 20:13.500
I'M OVER AT CARLTON'S
GETTING A HAIRCUT,

20:13.500 --> 20:15.708
WHEN THE GUY NEXT TO ME
STARTS TALKING
ABOUT A RUMOR

20:15.708 --> 20:17.625
THAT'S MAKING THE ROUNDS
AT THE HIGH SCHOOL

20:17.625 --> 20:19.834
ABOUT SOME PUNK KID
SLEEPING WITH A TEACHER.

20:19.834 --> 20:21.708
AND SO I SAY TO MYSELF,

20:21.708 --> 20:23.208
"WELL,
IF IT INVOLVES SEX,

20:23.208 --> 20:25.667
IT COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE
MY BROTHER PACEY."

20:25.667 --> 20:30.041
THEN THE GUYS SAYS,
"WORD IS, KID MADE IT
ALL UP.

20:30.041 --> 20:32.041
THAT IT'S ALL
JUST A LIE."

20:32.041 --> 20:35.542
AND SO I SAY TO MYSELF,
"BINGO."

20:35.542 --> 20:38.667
YOU KNOW, THAT'S REALLY
FASCINATING, DOUGIE.

20:38.667 --> 20:40.917
YOU KNOW, AND ALL
I COULD THINK OF,

20:40.917 --> 20:45.417
AND IT MADE ME SICK,
MIND YOU, WAS POOR,
SWEET TAMARA

20:45.417 --> 20:47.500
MUST BE RIPPING HER
APART.

20:47.500 --> 20:49.542
COME ON, PACEY,
WHY DON'T YOU
GIVE ME A GLIMPSE

20:49.542 --> 20:51.083
INTO THE INNER
WORKINGS HERE, HUH?

20:51.083 --> 20:53.583
WHAT WAS
THE RATIONALE--BOREDOM

20:53.583 --> 20:55.917
OR JUST A CLASSIC
CRY FOR ATTENTION?

20:55.917 --> 20:57.875
WELL, ACTUALLY, NO.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:57.875 --> 20:59.875
I THOUGHT IT WAS UP TO ME
TO LET THIS TOWN KNOW

20:59.875 --> 21:03.333
THAT AT LEAST ONE PERSON
IN OUR FAMILY WAS HAVING
HETEROSEXUAL SEX.

21:03.333 --> 21:05.917
AND, YOU KNOW, JUST
AS A MATTER OF CURIOSITY,

21:05.917 --> 21:08.583
DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU,
JUST FOR A BRIEF MOMENT,

21:08.583 --> 21:11.583
TO DEFEND AND SUPPORT ME
IN THIS CONVERSATION?

21:11.583 --> 21:13.875
OR DOES
THE WITTER FAMILY CREDO
PREVENT SUCH EMOTIONS?

21:13.875 --> 21:15.959
OH, THAT'S REALLY
HEAVY, PACEY.

21:15.959 --> 21:17.083
I'M SURE
THE SCHOOL BOARD

21:17.083 --> 21:19.625
WILL BE AS MOVED
AS I AM BY THAT.

21:21.083 --> 21:23.542
OH, YOU HAVEN'T
HEARD, HUH?

21:23.542 --> 21:26.583
WELL, IT SEEMS YOUR LIES
HAVE MADE IT ALL THE WAY
UP THE FOOD CHAIN.

21:26.583 --> 21:29.875
SUPERINTENDENT STEVENS
IS CALLING AN EMERGENCY
BOARD MEETING

21:29.875 --> 21:33.333
TO DISCUSS WHETHER
CHARGES SHOULD BE LAID
AGAINST MISS JACOBS.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.792
NO DOUBT YOUR PRESENCE
WILL BE REQUESTED.

21:35.792 --> 21:37.959
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY,
ISN'T IT, PACEY,

21:37.959 --> 21:40.291
BUT, THERE ARE
ACTUALLY PEOPLE
IN THIS TOWN

21:40.291 --> 21:41.000
WHO TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY.

21:44.291 --> 21:46.208
UNFORTUNATELY,
YOU'RE NOT ONE OF THEM.

21:48.417 --> 21:51.333
LOOK, RIGHT NOW,
BODIE IS ON HIS WAY
TO A FRENCH RESTAURANT

21:51.333 --> 21:52.500
ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE COUNTY,

21:52.500 --> 21:55.166
AND THE ONLY THING
PREVENTING THE BIRTH
OF HIS FIRST CHILD

21:55.166 --> 21:56.708
FROM BECOMING A HAZY
SECOND-HAND STORY

21:56.708 --> 21:57.625
IS THIS LITTLE DEVICE.

21:59.083 --> 22:00.500
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?
FOR BODIE?

22:00.500 --> 22:02.792
ALL RIGHT...

22:02.792 --> 22:04.792
BUT I WANT FINAL CUT.

22:04.792 --> 22:05.917
DEAL.

22:07.250 --> 22:09.166
Joey: BESSIE.

22:09.166 --> 22:12.417
I'VE GOT SOMEONE
TO HELP YOU.

22:12.417 --> 22:16.208
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
YOU'VE DONE WHAT
I THINK YOU'VE DONE.

22:16.208 --> 22:17.875
CONFLICT.
PERFECT.

22:17.875 --> 22:19.375
HOW FAR APART
ARE THE CONTRACTIONS?

22:19.375 --> 22:20.667
JOEY!

22:20.667 --> 22:22.166
SHE'S A NURSE.
SHE CAN HELP.

22:22.166 --> 22:24.333
SHE'S ALSO A BORDERLINE
RACIST WHO HATES
EVERYTHING

22:24.333 --> 22:25.834
ABOUT ME
AND MY BOYFRIEND

22:25.834 --> 22:27.500
AND OUR UNBORN CHILD.

22:27.500 --> 22:29.291
IS EVERYTHING OK?

22:29.291 --> 22:31.000
WE'RE JUST HAVING
AN IMPROMPTU HOME BIRTH.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.542
NOTHING TO BE
CONCERNED ABOUT.

22:32.542 --> 22:34.667
REALLY?
BECAUSE I'VE GOT
A FEW CONCERNS.

22:34.667 --> 22:37.000
GIRLS, MOVE
THAT COFFEE TABLE
OUT OF THE WAY.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.041
PULSE IS STRONG.
TEMPERATURE'S FINE.

22:40.041 --> 22:43.500
OK, GIRLS, WE'RE GOING
TO MOVE BESSIE OVER
INTO THIS CHAIR OVER HERE.

22:43.500 --> 22:45.000
GENTLY DOES IT. EASY, EASY.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.583
THAT'S IT.

22:46.583 --> 22:48.458
OOH!

22:48.458 --> 22:50.166
[BREATHING DEEPLY]

22:50.166 --> 22:52.834
Grams: THAT'S IT.

22:52.834 --> 22:54.708
I'M AGAINST THIS,
YOU KNOW.

22:54.708 --> 22:56.625
OK, MR. DeMILLE,
YOU CAN DO SOMETHING USEFUL

22:56.625 --> 22:59.208
AND CAN GET US
SOME LARGE TOWELS
AND WASHCLOTHS, PLEASE.

22:59.208 --> 23:02.125
THAT'S IT. EASY.
EASY, EASY, EASY.

23:02.125 --> 23:04.083
CALM DOWN.
KEEP BREATHING SLOWLY.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.291
BREATHE EASY.
THAT'S IT. CUSHIONS!

23:06.667 --> 23:07.625
OOH. OOH.

23:11.041 --> 23:12.834
THANK YOU,
JOSEPHINE.

23:12.834 --> 23:15.083
IT'S JOEY, ACTUALLY.

23:15.083 --> 23:18.166
NO. IT'S JUDAS, ACTUALLY.

23:18.166 --> 23:19.708
OK, AS FOR YOU,

23:19.708 --> 23:21.708
I'M GOING
TO MAKE YOU A DEAL.

23:21.708 --> 23:23.667
THIS IS GOING TO BE
A BIG DAY FOR YOU,

23:23.667 --> 23:25.083
AND AS YOUR
ATTENDING NURSE,

23:25.083 --> 23:27.417
YOU MAY FEEL
AN OVERWHELMING
OUTPOURING OF GRATITUDE

23:27.417 --> 23:29.333
TOWARDS ME WHEN WE'RE
DONE HERE TODAY,

23:29.333 --> 23:30.417
BUT I PROMISE,

23:30.417 --> 23:33.041
I WILL NOT TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF YOUR
POSTPARTUM BLISS,

23:33.041 --> 23:35.375
AND I WILL RESIST ANY
URGE TO BOND WITH YOU

23:35.375 --> 23:37.166
OVER THE SHARED
EXPERIENCE OF THIS EVENT

23:37.166 --> 23:38.875
IF YOU WILL DO ME ONE
SMALL FAVOR IN RETURN.

23:38.875 --> 23:40.708
WHAT'S THAT?

23:40.708 --> 23:42.583
SHUT UP.

23:42.583 --> 23:44.208
NOW, WHERE ARE
THOSE TOWELS?

23:54.875 --> 23:56.583
TAMMY, LISTEN,
I'M SORRY--

23:56.583 --> 23:58.583
MR. WITTER,
WE HAVEN'T MET.

23:58.583 --> 24:00.750
I'M CAROLINE FIELDS,
MISS JACOBS' ATTORNEY.

24:00.750 --> 24:02.750
ATTORNEY?

24:02.750 --> 24:04.708
UNDER ADVICE FROM COUNSEL,
SHE'S CHOSEN

24:04.708 --> 24:06.792
NOT TO DISCUSS
THIS CASE WITH YOU
AT THE CURRENT TIME.

24:06.792 --> 24:08.917
WHAT ARE YOU TALK--
THIS ISN'T ABOUT--
TAMMY--

24:08.917 --> 24:11.083
MR. WITTER, I MUST AGAIN
ASK YOU TO PLEASE REFRAIN

24:11.083 --> 24:13.083
FROM COMMUNICATING
DIRECTLY WITH MY CLIENT.

24:13.083 --> 24:15.792
IN ADDITION, SHOULD YOU
NEED TO SPEAK
WITH HER AT ANY FUTURE DATE,

24:15.792 --> 24:17.542
YOU'RE INSTRUCTED
TO CONTACT ME,

24:17.542 --> 24:19.583
AND I'LL PASS ALONG
ANY PERTINENT INFORMATION.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.208
IS THAT CLEAR?

24:22.917 --> 24:23.834
YEAH.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.458
CAROLINE.

24:27.458 --> 24:29.750
YES, MR. WITTER.

24:29.750 --> 24:32.333
WOULD YOU TELL YOUR CLIENT
I'M SORRY?

24:39.291 --> 24:40.959
AAH!

24:40.959 --> 24:42.208
Jen: OK, ALL RIGHT.

24:42.208 --> 24:45.291
THAT CONTRACTION
WAS EXACTLY 60 SECONDS
APART FROM THE LAST ONE.

24:45.291 --> 24:47.417
Grams: OK.
YOU'RE COMPLETELY
DILATED, DEAR.

24:47.417 --> 24:48.959
TIME TO PUSH NOW.

24:48.959 --> 24:50.458
Bessie: PUSH WHAT?

24:50.458 --> 24:51.667
THE BABY, DEAR.

24:51.667 --> 24:53.959
OH.

24:53.959 --> 24:56.458
SHE'S GOING TO BE OK,
JOEY.

24:56.458 --> 24:57.458
YEAH, I KNOW.

24:58.959 --> 25:00.917
THIS SESSION HAS BEEN
CONVENED.

25:00.917 --> 25:04.000
AND THE REASON WE'VE
ASKED YOU TO COME BEFORE US
THIS AFTERNOON, MISS JACOBS,

25:04.000 --> 25:06.834
IS THAT WE FIND OURSELVES FACED
WITH A PERSISTENT RUMOR,

25:06.834 --> 25:08.959
A DISTURBING RUMOR WHICH
UNDOUBTEDLY YOU'VE HEARD.

25:08.959 --> 25:10.333
YES, I'VE HEARD IT.

25:10.333 --> 25:12.500
THEN LET ME BE DIRECT,
MISS JACOBS.

25:12.500 --> 25:14.333
PACEY WITTER IS
A STUDENT OF YOURS

25:14.333 --> 25:16.166
IN ONE OF YOUR SOPHOMORE
ENGLISH CLASSES?

25:16.166 --> 25:17.667
YES, HE IS.

25:17.667 --> 25:19.834
THERE HAVE BEEN ALLEGATIONS
OF A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP

25:19.834 --> 25:21.625
BETWEEN YOURSELF
AND MR. WITTER.

25:21.625 --> 25:23.834
PLEASE FORGIVE MY CANDOR,
MISS JACOBS, WHEN I ASK YOU

25:23.834 --> 25:25.333
ARE THESE ALLEGATIONS TRUE?

25:28.000 --> 25:29.166
WELL, YOU SEE--

25:29.166 --> 25:31.375
Pacey:
NO! NO, THEY'RE NOT.

25:33.500 --> 25:36.500
MR. WITTER, YOU ARE TO WAIT
UNTIL YOU'RE SUMMONED.

25:36.500 --> 25:40.625
LOOK, I DON'T MEAN
ANY DISRESPECT HERE,

25:40.625 --> 25:42.875
BUT IF YOU'LL JUST
GIVE ME A SECOND,

25:42.875 --> 25:45.166
I'LL HAVE YOU ALL
HOME FOR DINNER, OK?

25:45.166 --> 25:48.458
OK, MR. WITTER,
WHAT IS IT YOU NEED TO SAY?

25:52.083 --> 25:56.417
LOOK, I KNOW THE ORIGIN
OF THESE RUMORS HAS BEEN
TRACED TO ME,

25:56.417 --> 26:00.417
AND, UH, I GUESS
THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE,

26:00.417 --> 26:03.166
'CAUSE, LOOK AT ME,
HERE I AM,
A C-PLUS STUDENT

26:03.166 --> 26:05.333
WHO SITS IN THE BACK
OF MISS JACOBS'
ENGLISH CLASS EVERY DAY

26:06.375 --> 26:09.041
DAYDREAMING
ABOUT THE SAME THING,

26:09.041 --> 26:11.375
ABOUT WHAT
IT WOULD BE LIKE

26:11.375 --> 26:12.917
TO BE A LITTLE BIT
BETTER-LOOKING,

26:12.917 --> 26:15.333
A LITTLE MORE
SOPHISTICATED,

26:15.333 --> 26:17.375
AND ABOUT
15 YEARS OLDER,

26:17.375 --> 26:19.542
'CAUSE THEN,
AND ONLY THEN,

26:19.542 --> 26:22.208
COULD MISS JACOBS
POSSIBLY LOOK AT ME
AS ANYTHING OTHER THAN

26:22.208 --> 26:24.875
JUST ANOTHER ONE
OF HER STUDENTS,

26:24.875 --> 26:27.458
AND ONLY THEN COULD
THIS RUMOR STAND ANY
CHANCE OF BEING TRUE.

26:27.458 --> 26:30.208
I MEAN,
DON'T GET ME WRONG.

26:30.208 --> 26:32.417
I'M REAL FLATTERED
WITH THE SERIOUSNESS

26:32.417 --> 26:34.250
THAT YOU TOOK
THESE ALLEGATIONS, BUT,

26:34.250 --> 26:37.583
YOU KNOW, PERSONALLY,
I ALWAYS JUST KIND
OF CHALKED THEM UP

26:37.583 --> 26:39.917
TO ADOLESCENT FANTASY.

26:39.917 --> 26:43.917
I KIND OF...
EXPECTED YOU GUYS
TO DO THE SAME.

26:43.917 --> 26:47.458
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG,
MR. WITTER,
BUT FOR THE RECORD,

26:47.458 --> 26:50.083
ARE YOU SAYING YOU DENY
THE AFOREMENTIONED
ALLEGATIONS?

26:50.083 --> 26:51.542
YEAH, FOR THE RECORD,
SIR,

26:51.542 --> 26:54.417
AND FOR ANYWHERE ELSE
YOU WANT TO PUT IT...

26:54.417 --> 26:57.375
MISS JACOBS IS MY
ENGLISH TEACHER,

26:57.375 --> 27:00.875
AND TO MY GREAT
DISAPPOINTMENT,

27:00.875 --> 27:02.542
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE.

27:05.750 --> 27:07.000
Bessie: OOOH...

27:07.000 --> 27:08.667
Grams: YES, YES.
THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT.

27:08.667 --> 27:11.458
YES, YES.
GOD!

27:11.458 --> 27:13.792
YOU ARE DOING FINE.

27:13.792 --> 27:15.917
GRAMS, I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

27:15.917 --> 27:17.834
GRAMS, THERE IS
A LOT OF BLOOD HERE.

27:17.834 --> 27:19.166
WHAT?

27:19.166 --> 27:20.291
DID SHE SAY BLOOD?!

27:20.291 --> 27:21.917
SHH! JUST RELAX, DEAR.

27:23.417 --> 27:25.792
ARE YOU AFRAID TO TELL ME
SOMETHING'S WRONG?

27:25.792 --> 27:27.834
IF SOMETHING'S WRONG,
I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT!

27:27.834 --> 27:30.458
DON'T BE SILLY, DEAR.
NOTHING IS AT ALL WRONG.

27:30.458 --> 27:32.625
NOW, WHAT JENNIFER
DOESN'T KNOW IS,

27:32.625 --> 27:35.125
A BLOODY SHOW
IS A NATURAL PART
OF THE BIRTHING PROCESS.

27:35.125 --> 27:38.125
NOW, THE LAST THING
WE CAN HAVE YOU DOING
IS WORRYING YOURSELF.

27:38.125 --> 27:40.333
JENNIFER,
A COOL WASHCLOTH NOW!

27:42.625 --> 27:45.959
MRS. RYAN...
I AM DOING OK, RIGHT?

27:45.959 --> 27:48.625
Dawson: YOU'RE DOING GREAT,
BESSIE. EVERYTHING'S GREAT.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.875
I WOULDN'T BE FILMING
IF EVERYTHING WASN'T FINE.

27:50.875 --> 27:52.125
WE'RE MAKING A MOVIE HERE.

27:52.125 --> 27:53.875
HEY, MRS. RYAN,
SMILE FOR THE CAMERA.

27:53.875 --> 27:55.458
OUT!

27:55.458 --> 27:56.708
YOU ARE DISTRACTING
MY PATIENT,

27:56.708 --> 27:59.000
AND I WON'T HAVE THAT.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.583
GRAMS, GRAMS,
THERE IS A PROBLEM,
ISN'T THERE?

28:01.583 --> 28:03.500
SOMETHING'S WRONG.
NOTHING IS AT ALL WRONG!

28:03.500 --> 28:05.834
AND HOW DARE YOU
ALARM MY PATIENT

28:05.834 --> 28:08.291
BY EXPRESSING
A CONTRARY OPINION
IN HER PRESENCE.

28:08.291 --> 28:09.875
GRAM, SHE IS LOSING
A LOT OF BLOOD.

28:09.875 --> 28:11.333
I DON'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT THIS,

28:11.333 --> 28:14.500
BUT I KNOW WHAT
A LOT OF BLOOD
LOOKS LIKE.

28:14.500 --> 28:16.166
OH, YES! ALL RIGHT.

28:16.166 --> 28:17.500
THERE'S MORE BLOOD
THAN I'D LIKE,

28:17.500 --> 28:20.708

28:28.291 --> 28:31.166
I NEED YOU TO SET ASIDE
YOUR ATTITUDE
AND SECOND-GUESSING

28:31.166 --> 28:32.917
AND HELP ME GET
THIS BABY OUT OF HER

28:32.917 --> 28:34.834

28:34.834 --> 28:36.708
AND COMPLICATIONS
WORSEN.

28:36.708 --> 28:39.542
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN
DO THAT, JENNIFER?

28:39.542 --> 28:40.875
DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN SUMMON UP

28:40.875 --> 28:42.917
EVEN THE SMALLEST
AMOUNT OF FAITH IN ME?

28:42.917 --> 28:44.875
BECAUSE IF YOU CAN,
I GUARANTEE YOU,

NO, MRS. RYAN.
I NEED SOMETHING.

WHAT DO YOU NEED, DEAR?

29:02.875 --> 29:05.166
A PILL! MEDICINE! SHE NEEDS
SOMETHING FOR THE PAIN!

29:05.166 --> 29:06.125
I DON'T HAVE ANY MEDICINE,

29:06.125 --> 29:08.375
BUT I DO HAVE ONE THING
THAT MAY WORK BETTER.

29:08.375 --> 29:10.000
PLEASE.
I'LL TRY ANYTHING.

OK, THEN REPEAT AFTER ME.

29:18.041 --> 29:20.583
I'M SORRY, MRS. RYAN.
THAT STUFF'S
NOT GONNA WORK ON ME.

ON MY MOM'S FACE

30:11.959 --> 30:13.750
WHEN I TELL HER
WHAT HAPPENED
IN THE LIVING ROOM.

30:17.291 --> 30:19.625
BESSIE'S GONNA BE OK, JOEY.

30:19.625 --> 30:22.458
AS FRIGHTENING
AS MRS. RYAN IS
IN DAILY LIFE,

30:22.458 --> 30:23.834
I THINK SHE'S
INCREDIBLY CAPABLE

30:23.834 --> 30:25.458
WHEN IT COMES
TO MEDICAL EMERGENCIES.

30:25.458 --> 30:26.708
I KNOW, DAWSON.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.792
FYI, I'M NOT OUT HERE

30:30.792 --> 30:33.375
BECAUSE I'M TOO WORRIED
ABOUT BESSIE
TO STAY INSIDE.

30:33.375 --> 30:35.166
WELL, I'M WORRIED,
BUT...

30:35.166 --> 30:36.125
WHAT IS IT?

30:37.834 --> 30:40.125
IT'S NOTHING.
IT'S--IT'S OK.

30:40.125 --> 30:41.959
IT'S STUPID.

30:41.959 --> 30:43.708
NO, IT'S NOT STUPID, JOEY.

30:43.708 --> 30:46.166
LOOK, I MAY NOT
ALWAYS AGREE WITH YOU,

30:46.166 --> 30:49.000
BUT YOUR REASONS
ARE NEVER STUPID.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.208
ALL RIGHT.
A QUESTION, DAWSON.

30:52.208 --> 30:54.083
WHO DOES BESSIE
REMIND YOU OF?

30:54.083 --> 30:55.667
THAT'S EASY.

30:57.834 --> 30:58.750
YOUR MOTHER.

31:00.542 --> 31:02.959
THERE ARE TIMES
WHEN THE RESEMBLANCE
IS MERELY A PASSING ONE,

31:02.959 --> 31:04.792
AND THEN...

31:04.792 --> 31:07.542
OTHERS WHEN...

31:07.542 --> 31:10.667
BESSIE SAYS OR DOES
SOMETHING, AND...

31:14.291 --> 31:16.375
IT'S LIKE MY MOM
NEVER DIED, YOU KNOW?

31:18.708 --> 31:20.542
WHEN SHE GOT SICK,

31:20.542 --> 31:23.583
WHEN SHE HAD--WHEN SHE
HAD CHEMO EVERY MONTH...

31:26.834 --> 31:29.583
IT LEFT HER
IN THIS TERRIBLE PAIN.

31:33.333 --> 31:35.000
AND...I WOULD COME HOME,

31:35.000 --> 31:37.708
AND I WOULD SIT
WITH HER, AND...

31:37.708 --> 31:40.166
SHE'D LET OUT
THESE CRIES THAT
I'D NEVER HEARD BEFORE,

31:40.166 --> 31:42.708
AND I PRAYED TO EVERY
AVAILABLE HIGHER SOURCE

31:42.708 --> 31:44.375
THAT I WOULD NEVER
HEAR THEM AGAIN

31:44.375 --> 31:45.750
FROM ANYONE
OR ANYTHING, AND...

31:48.583 --> 31:50.583
SOMEHOW,
SOMEBODY LISTENED...

31:52.875 --> 31:54.417
'CAUSE LUCKILY,
I NEVER DID, YOU KNOW?

31:54.417 --> 31:55.708
UNTIL TODAY.

32:00.375 --> 32:01.917
HMM.

32:01.917 --> 32:04.959
JOEY, WHEN YOUR MOTHER
WAS IN ALL THAT PAIN,

32:04.959 --> 32:06.458
WHY DID YOU SIT BY HER?

32:08.250 --> 32:10.458
COME ON, DAWSON.

32:10.458 --> 32:12.417
'CAUSE SHE NEEDED ME.

32:12.417 --> 32:15.083

32:17.917 --> 32:20.291

NEEDED ME.

FOR THE WHOLE WITTER FAMILY

FOLLOW YOU, TAMARA.

ALL THAT TALK
ABOUT BREAKING ' UP
