WEBVTT

00:25.250 --> 00:28.208
Woman in movie: AAH!

00:28.208 --> 00:30.500
AAH!

00:30.500 --> 00:32.834
AAH!

00:40.041 --> 00:42.708
WOW.

00:42.708 --> 00:45.625
"WOW. LOOK AT
THE HIDDEN TREASURE
I'VE UNEARTHED"?

00:45.625 --> 00:49.208
OR "WOW.
THERE'S 87 MINUTES
OF MY LIFE I'D LIKE BACK"?

00:49.208 --> 00:51.542
I WANTED TO HATE IT.

00:51.542 --> 00:54.250
I REALLY DID,
BUT I--

00:54.250 --> 00:57.708
I CAN'T. THIS--I MEAN,
THIS IS THE...

00:57.708 --> 01:01.625
HEARTBREAKING WORK
OF A STAGGERING GENIUS.

01:01.625 --> 01:03.959
WAIT A SECOND.
ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME

01:03.959 --> 01:06.208
THAT TURN AWAY, MY SWEET"
IS THE PRODUCT OF A GENIUS?

01:06.208 --> 01:08.708
AS MUCH AS IT PAINS ME,
YEAH.

01:08.708 --> 01:09.750
I DON'T KNOW, DAWSON.

01:09.750 --> 01:11.750
ALL I SAW WAS SOME
FORMULA GANGSTER MOVIE.

01:11.750 --> 01:13.583
I'M STILL
PICKING THE PULP
OUT OF MY TEETH.

01:13.583 --> 01:15.500
YEAH, IT WAS PULPY,
AND BY-THE-NUMBERS,

01:15.500 --> 01:17.708
BUT UNDERNEATH
ALL THE HARD-BOILED
STURM AND DRANG

01:17.708 --> 01:20.208
WAS THIS GREAT BIG
THUMPING HEART.

01:20.208 --> 01:21.250
I MEAN, THIS
IS A LOVE STORY

01:21.250 --> 01:23.875
MASQUERADING
AS A GENRE PIECE.

01:23.875 --> 01:24.875
DAWSON, THE GIRL
HIRED THE GUY TO KILL HER.

01:24.875 --> 01:27.000
HOW IS THAT A LOVE STORY?

01:27.000 --> 01:29.250
BECAUSE JUST WHEN SHE
HAD GIVEN UP ON LOVE,

01:29.250 --> 01:31.333
HE CAME INTO HER LIFE.
AND HE TRIED TO KILL HER.

01:31.333 --> 01:32.625
BUT HE COULDN'T
BECAUSE HE FELL IN LOVE
WITH HER.

01:32.625 --> 01:35.458
RIGHT WHEN SHE'D GIVEN UP
AND STOPPED LOOKING,

01:35.458 --> 01:37.834
SHE STUMBLED INTO
HER OWN FAIRY TALE.
IT'S BRILLIANT.

01:37.834 --> 01:39.041
I DON'T KNOW.
IF YOU ASK ME,

01:39.041 --> 01:42.834
TARENTINO DOES THIS STUFF
A LOT BETTER AND IN COLOR.

01:42.834 --> 01:44.333
OH, HO! AND NOW
YOU'RE COMPLETELY

01:44.333 --> 01:45.834
PROVING MY POINT
EVEN MORE FOR ME.

01:45.834 --> 01:47.083
WHICH IS?

01:47.083 --> 01:50.417
A.I. BROOKS WAS
WAY AHEAD OF HIS TIME.

01:50.417 --> 01:52.125
I LIKE YOU LIKE THIS.

01:52.125 --> 01:54.959
DARE I ASK
WHAT "THIS" IS?

01:54.959 --> 01:58.458
PASSIONATE, OPINIONATED,
IRRITATING, EVEN.

01:58.458 --> 02:01.000
WHY--WHY DID HE STOP?

02:01.000 --> 02:03.917
SOMEONE COULD ASK YOU
THE SAME THING. I MEAN,
WHEN I LEFT FOR COLLEGE

02:03.917 --> 02:07.834
YOU WERE LIKE THIS
UNSTOPPABLE FORCE
OF FILM GEEK ENERGY.

02:07.834 --> 02:10.500
I MEAN, YOU WERE
ALL SPIELBERG THIS
AND HITCHCOCK THAT,

02:10.500 --> 02:13.125
AND I COME BACK
AND FILM IS LIKE
THIS UNFINISHED PROJECT

02:13.125 --> 02:15.500
YOU SORT OF STUFFED
IN YOUR CLOSET.

02:15.500 --> 02:17.917
WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION
WHATEVER HAPPENED

02:17.917 --> 02:19.250
TO THE TALENTED YOUNG
FILMMAKER DAWSON LEERY?

02:19.250 --> 02:23.166
WHY DID HE STOP?
AND WHERE IS HE NOW?

03:19.166 --> 03:22.917
I'M NOT PAYING YOU TO STUDY
FOR YOUR G.E.D., DEAR.

03:22.917 --> 03:26.333
MRS. VALENTINE,
IT'S 3:45, WHICH MEANS
I'M EARLY.

03:26.333 --> 03:27.542
15 WHOLE MINUTES
TO DO WITH
WHAT I PLEASE.

03:27.542 --> 03:29.458
AND WHY IS IT SO HARD
FOR YOU TO REMEMBER

03:29.458 --> 03:31.708
THAT I GO TO SCHOOL
WITH YOUR SON?

03:31.708 --> 03:34.208
YES, AND SPEAKING OF THINGS
I'D JUST AS SOON FORGET,

03:34.208 --> 03:36.834
I RAN INTO YOUR SISTER BECKY
AT THE DRUG STORE.

03:36.834 --> 03:39.792
CLEARLY NOT THERE
TO PICK UP ANY CONTRACEPTIVES.

03:39.792 --> 03:41.000
IT'S BESSIE.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.458
OH, WELL, THAT'S IMPORTANT,
ISN'T IT, DEAR?

03:44.458 --> 03:45.875
WALTER!

03:45.875 --> 03:47.375
MRS. VALENTINE.

03:47.375 --> 03:48.708
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU,
WALTER?

03:48.708 --> 03:49.917
I JUST WANTED
TO MAKE SURE

03:49.917 --> 03:51.959
EVERYTHING WAS IN ORDER
FOR SATURDAY NIGHT.

03:51.959 --> 03:53.500
OH, WALTER,
WE ARE IN TIP-TOP SHAPE.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.625
WE ARE FULLY STOCKED
AND FULLY STAFFED,

03:55.625 --> 03:57.959
AND I WAS JUST ABOUT TO TELL
LITTLE JOEY POTTER HERE

03:57.959 --> 03:59.458
THAT HER
SATURDAY NIGHT OFF

03:59.458 --> 04:01.208
WAS NOW
A SATURDAY NIGHT BACK ON.

04:01.208 --> 04:02.667
BUT--
JOEY.

04:02.667 --> 04:06.208
IN ADDITION TO BEING
ONE OF THE CLUB'S
HANDSOMEST MEMBERS,

04:06.208 --> 04:09.083
MR. KUBELIK HERE
IS ALSO THE ALUMNI REP
FOR WORTHINGTON,

04:09.083 --> 04:11.792
AND SATURDAY NIGHT HE'S
HOSTING A NETWORKING PARTY

04:11.792 --> 04:13.000
FOR PROMISING
NEW APPLICANTS,

04:13.000 --> 04:15.458
AND I'M GOING TO NEED YOU
TO HELP WAIT ON THEM.

04:15.458 --> 04:16.875
I CAN'T.

04:16.875 --> 04:17.791
SO YOU'RE QUITTING, THEN?

04:17.791 --> 04:19.583
NO--
OOH!
YOU'VE GONE INSANE.

04:19.583 --> 04:22.792
LOOK, MRS. VALENTINE,
I WILL BE THERE.

04:22.792 --> 04:23.583
YES. YOU WILL.

04:23.583 --> 04:26.417
NOW, WALTER,
WHERE WERE WE?

04:26.417 --> 04:28.000
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE
UNDERSTANDING ME,
MRS. VALENTINE.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.333
I'LL BE THERE...

04:31.333 --> 04:33.083
AT THE PARTY...

04:33.083 --> 04:34.583
AS A GUEST.

04:34.583 --> 04:38.667
[LAUGHING]

04:38.667 --> 04:41.375
Mr. Kubelik:
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU'RE JOSEPHINE POTTER?

04:41.375 --> 04:43.166
HEY, IT'S A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU.

04:43.166 --> 04:45.291
YOUR ESSAY
WAS OUTSTANDING.

04:45.291 --> 04:46.708
MRS. VALENTINE,
THIS YOUNG LADY

04:46.708 --> 04:49.375
IS ONE OF OUR
MOST PROMISING
APPLICANTS.

04:49.375 --> 04:50.708
OH.
I WOULD
APPRECIATE IT

04:50.708 --> 04:51.417
IF YOU GAVE HER
THE EVENING OFF

04:51.417 --> 04:53.375
AND SAT HER
AT MY TABLE.

04:53.375 --> 04:55.083
OF COURSE,
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

04:55.083 --> 04:57.959
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHO WE'RE GOING TO GET
TO REPLACE HER.

04:57.959 --> 05:01.125
JOEY'S SUCH A SHINING MEMBER
OF OUR WAIT STAFF.

05:01.125 --> 05:03.500
WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS DRUE.

05:06.291 --> 05:07.542
YES. YES.

05:15.208 --> 05:16.375
OK, GUYS.
HISTORIC MOMENT.

05:16.375 --> 05:18.917
I AM FINISHING
MY VERY LAST ESSAY

05:18.917 --> 05:21.542
FROM MY VERY LAST
COLLEGE APPLICATION...

05:21.542 --> 05:23.000
USC FILM SCHOOL.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.959
AND I...AM...

05:26.875 --> 05:29.708
DONE.
Gale: CONGRATULATIONS, HONEY.

05:29.708 --> 05:31.125
Mitch: YEAH,
WE'RE PROUD OF YOU.

05:31.125 --> 05:33.458
AND NOW YOU'RE FREE
TO RELIEVE YOUR
PREGNANT MOTHER

05:33.458 --> 05:35.458
OF HER LIGHT-STRINGING DUTY.

05:35.458 --> 05:36.417
WOW. COULD IT BE?

05:36.417 --> 05:38.125
COULD THIS MEAN
IT'S TIME

05:38.125 --> 05:40.291
FOR THE ANNUAL
LEERY HOLIDAY PARTY?

05:44.375 --> 05:46.750
OH, DID I
JUST SAY SOMETHING
WILDLY INAPPROPRIATE?

05:46.750 --> 05:48.500
OH, NO, NOT AT ALL, HONEY.

05:48.500 --> 05:49.708
IT'S JUST, UM...

05:49.708 --> 05:51.291
WELL, WE HAVEN'T
DONE THAT IN A WHILE.

05:51.291 --> 05:53.500
LET ME DECODE.

05:53.500 --> 05:56.208
WE HAVEN'T HAD
A CHRISTMAS PARTY
PAST COUPLE OF YEARS

05:56.208 --> 05:59.250
BECAUSE MR. AND MRS. LEERY
HAVE BEEN BUSY RIDING
A ROLLER COASTER

05:59.250 --> 06:01.166
OTHERWISE KNOWN AS
THEIR RELATIONSHIP.

06:01.166 --> 06:02.458
OH.

06:02.458 --> 06:04.291
WELL,
THAT'S TOO BAD.

06:04.291 --> 06:05.500
I LOVED
THOSE PARTIES.

06:05.500 --> 06:08.708
IT ALL JUST SEEMS A BIT
OVERWHELMING AT THE MOMENT.

06:08.708 --> 06:09.917
WHAT, WITH THE BABY--

06:09.917 --> 06:10.917
AND THE RESTAURANT.

06:10.917 --> 06:12.000
OK, LET'S MAKE A DEAL.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
YOU HAVE THE PARTY,

06:13.000 --> 06:14.333
AND I TAKE CARE
OF EVERYTHING.

06:14.333 --> 06:15.417
I WILL CATER.
I'LL DECORATE.

06:15.417 --> 06:17.792
I'LL EVEN CALL
ALL THE GUESTS.

06:17.792 --> 06:20.250
OH, COME ON. PLEASE?
YOU GOT TO LET ME.

06:21.875 --> 06:23.208
WELL, SWEETHEART, IF IT MEANS
THAT MUCH TO YOU.

06:23.208 --> 06:25.208
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

06:25.208 --> 06:25.625
THANKS.

06:28.291 --> 06:29.667
WE HAVE GOT
A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

06:29.667 --> 06:32.375
WHAT WAS THE PART YOU SAID
ABOUT YOU DOING EVERYTHING?

06:41.792 --> 06:42.208
WILL.

06:42.208 --> 06:43.917
GRACE.

06:43.917 --> 06:45.792
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING,
JACK?

06:45.792 --> 06:47.458
NO. NO, THANKS, GRAMS.

06:50.875 --> 06:53.083
NOTHING FOR ME.
I'M FINE. THANK YOU.

06:53.083 --> 06:54.708
[LAUGHING]

06:54.708 --> 06:56.166
WHAT WAS THAT
ALL ABOUT?

06:56.166 --> 06:58.917
THAT, MY DEAR,
IS THE EXTERNAL MANIFESTATION

06:58.917 --> 07:01.291
OF GRAMS'
EXTREME DISAPPOINTMENT IN ME

07:01.291 --> 07:02.625
FOR THAT WHOLE
ECSTASY INCIDENT.

07:02.625 --> 07:04.917
SHE'S STILL
STUCK ON THAT, HUH?

07:04.917 --> 07:05.917
YEAH.
NOT A WORD IN WEEKS.

07:05.917 --> 07:08.208
WHICH MAKES THE HOUSE
THAT GRAMPS BUILT

07:08.208 --> 07:09.208
A BIT CHILLY AT THE MOMENT.

07:09.208 --> 07:11.542
HMM. WELL,
SHE WILL GET OVER IT.

07:11.542 --> 07:13.125
SHE ALWAYS DOES.

07:13.125 --> 07:15.250
RIGHT. WHATEVER.

07:15.250 --> 07:17.041
DO YOU WANT
TO DO SOMETHING?

07:17.041 --> 07:19.250
DO YOU WANT TO GO
SEE A MOVIE?

07:19.250 --> 07:21.625
UH, YEAH.

07:21.625 --> 07:23.041
YEAH, I'D LOVE TO.

07:23.041 --> 07:25.041
PERFECT WAY TO CELEBRATE,
ACTUALLY.

07:25.041 --> 07:26.542
CELEBRATE?

07:26.542 --> 07:28.708
I FINISHED
MY APPLICATIONS TODAY.

07:28.708 --> 07:30.959
JUST HANDED 'EM
TO MS. WATSON...

07:30.959 --> 07:32.750
AND THE ESSAY PART
ALMOST KILLED ME.

07:32.750 --> 07:36.041
IF I EVER IN MY LIFE
HAVE TO WRITE ABOUT

07:36.041 --> 07:37.083
WHERE I SEE MYSELF
IN 10 YEARS,

07:37.083 --> 07:38.583
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY,
"DEAD,"

07:38.583 --> 07:40.959
BECAUSE THE PROSPECT
OF WRITING ABOUT IT

07:40.959 --> 07:43.500
WILL HAVE DRIVEN ME
TO SUICIDE.

07:44.834 --> 07:48.708
GOOD. THAT'S GREAT.
AWESOME. CONGRATS.

07:48.708 --> 07:51.125
OK, SO WHAT ARE WE
GONNA SEE?

07:51.125 --> 07:52.792
UM...YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:52.792 --> 07:54.291
I WANT TO SEE THAT GAY ONE
WITH DEAN CAIN.

07:54.291 --> 07:57.166
ALL THE REVIEWERS
ARE CALLING IT
ST. HOMO'S FIRE.

07:57.166 --> 07:58.458
SOUNDS AWESOME.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

07:58.458 --> 08:01.375
YEAH. YEAH.
IT SOUNDS GOOD.

08:01.375 --> 08:02.792
LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING.

08:02.792 --> 08:05.625
HAVE YOU FINISHED
YOUR APPLICATIONS YET?

08:05.625 --> 08:09.041
YEAH. PRETTY MUCH. WHY?

08:09.041 --> 08:10.125
HOW MUCH IS PRETTY MUCH?

08:10.125 --> 08:14.625
UM, I JUST HAVE
THE ESSAY PART LEFT.

08:14.625 --> 08:17.208
WELL, I TALKED
TO MS. WATSON,

08:17.208 --> 08:19.125
AND SHE MENTIONED
SOMETHING ABOUT

08:19.125 --> 08:21.125
NOT GETTING
ANYTHING FROM YOU,

08:21.125 --> 08:23.000
AND I SAID,
WELL, COME ON.
JEN LINDLEY,

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
THAT'S CRAZY.
SHE'S ALL ABOUT
HIGHER LEARNING.

08:25.000 --> 08:25.834
TOTALLY.
SO WHERE
DID YOU APPLY?

08:25.834 --> 08:27.834
BUNCH OF PLACES.
COME ON, JEN.

08:27.834 --> 08:29.458
WHAT'S WITH ALL
THE VAGUE ANSWERS?

08:29.458 --> 08:30.417
WHAT'S WITH ALL
THE ANNOYING QUESTIONS?

08:30.417 --> 08:32.457
THERE'S A DEADLINE.

08:32.457 --> 08:33.667
AND IT'S QUICKLY
APPROACHING.

08:33.667 --> 08:35.207
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I'M FINE.

08:39.667 --> 08:40.917
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HAVE TO SAY

08:40.917 --> 08:43.707
I'M KIND OF NOT
IN A MOVIE MOOD AFTER ALL.

08:43.707 --> 08:46.250
CAN WE CATCH UP LATER?

08:46.250 --> 08:48.000
YEAH.

08:48.000 --> 08:48.708
SURE.

08:52.166 --> 08:54.583
I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL.

08:54.583 --> 08:55.041
OK.

08:55.041 --> 08:56.083
BYE.

08:56.083 --> 08:58.208
GOOD-BYE.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.375
GRAMS.

09:15.375 --> 09:17.250
THINK YOU COULD
DO ME A FAVOR?

09:17.250 --> 09:20.166
ANYTHING, OF COURSE.
COOKIE?

09:20.166 --> 09:21.291
YEAH.

09:21.291 --> 09:22.375
THANKS.

09:22.375 --> 09:25.417
EXTRA SPRINKLES.

09:25.417 --> 09:28.125
YOU THINK YOU COULD
TALK TO JEN?

09:28.125 --> 09:30.125
ANYTHING BUT THAT,
PERHAPS.

09:30.125 --> 09:32.375
LOOK, I KNOW
THE TWO OF YOU

09:32.375 --> 09:34.250
AREN'T ON
THE BEST OF TERMS
AT THE MOMENT,

09:34.250 --> 09:35.458
BUT I'M WORRIED
ABOUT HER.

09:35.458 --> 09:36.500
I HAVE THIS FEELING
SHE HASN'T

09:36.500 --> 09:38.208
FILLED OUT ANY OF HER
APPLICATIONS

09:38.208 --> 09:39.375
AND SHE'S
NOT TALKING ABOUT IT,

09:39.375 --> 09:41.250
SO I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU COULD TALK TO HER.

09:41.250 --> 09:42.750
NO, NO, JACK.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.834
JENNIFER IS A BIG GIRL.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.250
GOD KNOWS,
I TRIED LONG AND HARD

09:46.250 --> 09:48.083
TO AID HER IN MAKING
THE RIGHT DECISIONS,

09:48.083 --> 09:51.333
BUT SHE NEITHER WANTS
NOR APPRECIATES MY HELP.

09:51.333 --> 09:52.583
SO THE ONLY THING
LEFT FOR ME TO DO

09:52.583 --> 09:54.750
IS TO LET HER
MAKE HER OWN MISTAKES.

09:54.750 --> 09:57.917
IF THE GIRL
CHOOSES TO DRAG HER HEELS
ABOUT COLLEGE,

09:57.917 --> 10:01.417
SO BE IT.
SHE IS ON HER OWN.

10:14.417 --> 10:18.792
SO, UM, HAVE YOU SEEN
ANY GOOD MOVIES LATELY?

10:18.792 --> 10:20.542
I SAW A PICTURE
CALLED STAR WARS
HERE A WHILE BACK.

10:20.542 --> 10:23.917
I, UH, I DIDN'T GET IT.

10:23.917 --> 10:27.625
STAR WARS  CAME OUT
IN 1977.

10:27.625 --> 10:29.625
LIKE I SAID,
IT WAS A WHILE BACK.

10:29.625 --> 10:32.333
I SAW A GREAT FILM
LAST NIGHT.

10:32.333 --> 10:33.625
BULLY FOR YOU.

10:33.625 --> 10:38.166
IT WAS
THIS INCREDIBLE FUSION
OF FILM NOIR,

10:38.166 --> 10:40.166
BLACK COMEDY,
AND A LOVE STORY.

10:40.166 --> 10:41.542
IT WAS--WHAT WAS
THE NAME OF IT? UM...

10:41.542 --> 10:44.000
TURN AWAY, MY SWEET.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.417
THINK YOU'RE PRETTY CLEVER,
DON'T YOU?

10:47.417 --> 10:48.792
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO DEAL WITH THIS?

10:48.792 --> 10:49.583
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO DEAL
WITH THE FACT

10:49.583 --> 10:51.834
THAT THE BIG GRUMPY OLD MAN

10:51.834 --> 10:54.291
WHO BASICALLY FORCED ME
INTO INDENTURED SERVITUDE

10:54.291 --> 10:57.000
TURNS OUT TO BE A CROSS
BETWEEN SAM FULLER
AND CAMERON CROWE?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.667
WHO'S CAMERON CROWE?

10:58.667 --> 11:01.041
UH, FAST TIMES
AT RIDGEMONT HIGH,

11:01.041 --> 11:02.542
SAY ANYTHING,
JERRY MAGUIRE.

11:02.542 --> 11:03.667
NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

11:03.667 --> 11:06.417
FULLER--HMM,
GOD REST HIS SOUL.

11:06.417 --> 11:07.583
HE DID
SOME GOOD PICTURES.

11:07.583 --> 11:10.000
AND SO DID YOU,
MR. BROOKS.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.375
I'VE SEEN EVERYTHING
I COULD GET MY HANDS ON.

11:12.375 --> 11:15.166
YOUR FILMS ARE--
THEY'RE AMAZING.

11:15.166 --> 11:18.458
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE LIKE THIS
TRUE AMERICAN PRIMITIVE.

11:18.458 --> 11:20.250
I HAVE SO MUCH RESPECT
FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

11:20.250 --> 11:21.458
FIRST OF ALL, MR. LEERY,
THEY'RE NOT FILMS.

11:21.458 --> 11:23.500
THEY'RE PICTURES.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.041
SECOND OF ALL,
THEY'RE NOT AMAZING.

11:25.041 --> 11:26.750
THEY'RE HACK WORK,
AND THIRD OF ALL,

11:26.750 --> 11:29.959
I'M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH
THIS NEW FOUND RESPECT
YOU HAVE FOR ME.

11:29.959 --> 11:31.500
YOU CAN PLAY THE CURMUDGEON
ALL YOU WANT, A.I. BROOKS,

11:31.500 --> 11:33.417
BUT YOU CAN'T FOOL ME.

11:33.417 --> 11:34.792
WELL, THAT'S A LOAD OFF.

11:34.792 --> 11:37.083
I SAW THOSE MOVIES,
AND THE MAN RESPONSIBLE
FOR THEM

11:37.083 --> 11:39.083
OBVIOUSLY CARES A GREAT DEAL
ABOUT THINGS THAT MATTER--

11:39.083 --> 11:43.041
THINGS LIKE LOVE AND DEATH
AND MORALITY AND HONOR.

11:43.041 --> 11:45.291
THE MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM
CARES A GREAT DEAL

11:45.291 --> 11:48.291
ABOUT EATING HIS
CHILEAN SEA BASS
IN PEACE.

11:48.291 --> 11:50.875
OK.

11:50.875 --> 11:53.375
I JUST--I--

11:53.375 --> 11:57.333
I WANTED TO TELL YOU
THAT YOUR MOV--YOUR PICTURES

11:57.333 --> 12:00.458
REALLY HAD
AN IMPACT ON ME.

12:00.458 --> 12:02.792
I JUST...

12:02.792 --> 12:04.375
WELL, I THOUGHT YOU
MIGHT LIKE TO HEAR THAT.

12:04.375 --> 12:08.875
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR THE KIND WORDS,
MR. LEERY, NOW I--

12:08.875 --> 12:11.291
CAN I--CAN I JUST ASK YOU
ABOUT THE CHEMISTRY

12:11.291 --> 12:14.041
BETWEEN YOUR 2 LEADS
IN TURN AWAY, MY SWEET?
IT WAS INCREDIBLE.

12:14.041 --> 12:17.083
IT WAS LIKE IT PRACTICALLY
JUMPED OFF THE SCREEN.

12:17.083 --> 12:18.917
LISTEN, I AM OLD,

12:18.917 --> 12:21.708
AND I RESERVE THE RIGHT
TO EAT MY DINNER IN PEACE.

12:21.708 --> 12:24.500
SO KINDLY REMOVE YOURSELF
FROM MY GENERAL VICINITY.

12:26.375 --> 12:28.959
OK.

12:45.041 --> 12:46.166
WELL?

12:46.166 --> 12:48.458
THE GIRL CAN'T HELP IT.
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

12:48.458 --> 12:50.834
DO YOU THINK
IT'S TOO MUCH?

12:50.834 --> 12:52.959
ONLY IF PACEY WEARS
HIS CAMOUFLAGE PANTS.

12:52.959 --> 12:55.959
WHICH ISN'T EXACTLY
OUTSIDE THE REALM
OF POSSIBILITY.

12:55.959 --> 12:59.458
YOU KNOW,
I DO FEEL KIND OF BAD

12:59.458 --> 13:00.750
DRAGGING HIM
TO THIS THING.

13:00.750 --> 13:02.959
OH, YOU'RE NOT DRAGGING HIM
TO ANYTHING.

13:02.959 --> 13:05.625
YOU NEED HIS SUPPORT.
I'M SURE HE GETS THAT.

13:05.625 --> 13:09.375
YEAH, WELL--

13:09.375 --> 13:11.458
I JUST--I DON'T WANT HIM
TO FEEL OUT OF PLACE.

13:11.458 --> 13:12.792
JOEY, MY BROTHER'S
NUTS ABOUT YOU.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.542
I THINK HE PLANS
TO MAKE A CAREER

13:15.542 --> 13:17.375
OUT OF BEING IN
CLOSE PROXIMITY TO YOU.

13:17.375 --> 13:20.708
JUST DON'T LET HIM DO THAT
NERVOUS JOKE-TELLING THING
THAT HE DOES.

13:22.291 --> 13:24.959
YOU ARE, HOWEVER,
GONNA MISS A GREAT PARTY
AT DAWSON'S HOUSE.

13:24.959 --> 13:26.959
DAWSON LEERY'S
HAVING A PARTY?
NOT SO MUCH.

13:26.959 --> 13:29.917
I TALKED MITCH AND GALE
INTO LETTING ME ORGANIZE
THEIR HOLIDAY PARTY.

13:29.917 --> 13:32.834
REALLY? I LOVE THOSE.

13:32.834 --> 13:34.333
I MEAN, THEY'VE BEEN
A PART OF MY LIFE

13:34.333 --> 13:35.834
SINCE I WAS, LIKE, 5,
I THINK.

13:35.834 --> 13:38.250
THEY ALWAYS PUT ME
IN THE RIGHT MOOD
FOR THE HOLIDAYS.

13:38.250 --> 13:40.500
WHICH IS KIND OF WEIRD
CONSIDERING DAWSON AND I
WOULD

13:40.500 --> 13:41.458
JUST HIDE
UP IN HIS BEDROOM

13:41.458 --> 13:43.000
AND WATCH OLD MOVIES,
BUT...

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
WHICH HAS IT'S OWN
DISTINCT CHARMS.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.083
I MEAN, DAWSON
IS ONE OF THOSE RARE GUYS

13:49.083 --> 13:50.625
WHO CAN SOMEHOW MAKE POPCORN
AND A RENTED VIDEO

13:50.625 --> 13:52.625
SEEM LIKE AN EVENT.

13:52.625 --> 13:56.125
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

13:56.125 --> 13:58.500
YOU'RE GONNA DO GREAT,
JOEY.

13:58.500 --> 13:59.542
HUH?

13:59.542 --> 14:02.000
SATURDAY NIGHT,
YOU'RE GONNA DO GREAT.

14:09.750 --> 14:11.333
GOOD JOB, DAWSON,
GETTING ALL OF YOUR
APPLICATIONS IN.

14:11.333 --> 14:14.542
I JUST HAD A COUPLE
OF QUESTIONS.
OK.

14:14.542 --> 14:16.083
WHY DO YOU THINK
YOU WANT TO BE
A FILMMAKER?

14:16.083 --> 14:19.166
UH, WELL, DOESN'T MY ESSAY
PRETTY MUCH COVER IT?

14:19.166 --> 14:21.834
THAT'S THE PROBLEM,
DAWSON. IT DOESN'T.

14:21.834 --> 14:24.000
YOU SPEND 5 PAGES
RATHER ELOQUENTLY

14:24.000 --> 14:26.834
SKIRTING
THE ESSAY QUESTION...

14:26.834 --> 14:29.959
WHY DO YOU  WANT TO BE
A FILMMAKER?

14:29.959 --> 14:33.333
WELL, IT'S A PRETTY DIFFICULT
QUESTION TO ANSWER.

14:33.333 --> 14:34.834
AND USC'S
A DIFFICULT SCHOOL
TO GET INTO.

14:34.834 --> 14:37.041
THERE ARE
THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS,
JUST LIKE YOURSELF,

14:37.041 --> 14:39.834
HOPING AGAINST HOPE
AT A CHANCE

14:39.834 --> 14:42.250
TO STUDY AT ONE OF
THE BEST FILM SCHOOLS
IN THE COUNTRY.

14:42.250 --> 14:44.792
SO I'M THINKING...

14:44.792 --> 14:46.834
WE MIGHT WANT TO SHOOT
FOR GREATNESS HERE.

14:46.834 --> 14:48.542
IN OTHER WORDS...

14:48.542 --> 14:51.708
DAWSON, DO BETTER.

14:56.375 --> 14:57.041
Pacey:
DO WE HAVE TO?

14:57.041 --> 14:58.333
YES, PACEY, WE HAVE TO.

14:58.333 --> 15:00.542
WELL, HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT HIRING AN ESCORT?

15:00.542 --> 15:03.375
FROM WHAT I'M TOLD
YOU CAN'T TAKE ME ANYWHERE.

15:03.375 --> 15:06.542
I CALLED AROUND,
BUT THEY'RE ALL OUT OF
SOCIALLY-PRESENTABLE MAN-MEAT.

15:06.542 --> 15:07.875
WHAT IF I JUST
BROKE UP WITH YOU?

15:07.875 --> 15:08.875
WHAT WOULD YOU DO THEN?

15:08.875 --> 15:10.166
LOOK,
DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

15:10.166 --> 15:11.917
YOU'RE STILL COMING WITH ME.

15:11.917 --> 15:13.750
FASCIST.
SCAREDY-CAT.

15:13.750 --> 15:16.166
ARE WE AT LEAST
GONNA HAVE A GOOD TIME?

15:16.166 --> 15:17.875
MY GUESS IS NO.

15:17.875 --> 15:20.291
SO WHY CAN'T WE JUST SAY
"NAY" TO THE WHOLE IDEA

15:20.291 --> 15:22.458
OF HANGING OUT
WITH THE PREP SCHOOL
CONTINGENT,

15:22.458 --> 15:24.000
GO OVER
TO MITCH AND GALE'S PARTY?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.125
BECAUSE, PACEY, THAT
WOULD SEVERELY DIMINISH

15:25.125 --> 15:28.750
MY CHANCES FOR
GETTING INTO COLLEGE.

15:28.750 --> 15:31.250
WELL, YOU PUT IT
THAT WAY--

15:31.250 --> 15:32.291
PACE?

15:32.291 --> 15:34.000
YES.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.417
YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT
THIS PARTY IS TO ME.

15:36.417 --> 15:38.166
YES, I KNOW.

15:38.166 --> 15:40.250
AND BEING IN
A RELATIONSHIP MEANS

15:40.250 --> 15:42.917
THAT SOMETIMES
YOU DO HAVE TO DO THINGS

15:42.917 --> 15:45.875
THAT YOU
DON'T PARTICULARLY ENJOY
FOR THAT OTHER PERSON.

15:45.875 --> 15:48.333
YEAH.

15:48.333 --> 15:49.625
YOU KNOW, FOR ME
THAT WOULD BE

15:49.625 --> 15:50.834
SUNDAY DINNERS
WITH YOUR PARENTS.

15:50.834 --> 15:53.375
OH, HOLD ON.
DO YOU THINK

15:53.375 --> 15:55.250
THAT I ENJOY
THOSE DINNERS
FOR ONE SECOND?

15:55.250 --> 15:56.583
FOR THE RECORD, WE COULD
STOP THOSE ANY TIME.

15:56.583 --> 15:59.417
I KNOW
YOU'RE STILL TRYING
TO GET OUT OF THIS PARTY.

15:59.417 --> 16:00.417
YEAH, I REALLY AM.
IS IT WORKING?

16:00.417 --> 16:03.458
IT'S LIKE WATCHING
A TRAIN WRECK.

16:13.625 --> 16:15.500
THESE ARE FOR YOU,
JENNIFER.

16:15.500 --> 16:17.208
FROM YOUR MOTHER AND FATHER.

16:17.208 --> 16:19.083
WHEW, THAT TIME OF YEAR
ALREADY.

16:22.083 --> 16:23.333
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

16:23.333 --> 16:24.625
THAT IS A SWEATER...
FROM MOM,

16:24.625 --> 16:26.041
FROM BARNEY'S.

16:26.041 --> 16:29.208
BUT IT WAS HAND-PICKED
BY THE MAID.

16:32.583 --> 16:35.458
YEAH, JEWELRY.
JEWELRY, PROBABLY FROM DAD,

16:35.458 --> 16:37.333
AND I'LL BET THAT IT WAS
THROWN BACK IN HIS FACE

16:37.333 --> 16:40.583
BY A SLUTTY SECRETARY WHO
DID NOT APPRECIATE THE FACT

16:40.583 --> 16:43.208
THAT SHE WAS
ACTUALLY BEING PAID
FOR SERVICES RENDERED.

16:43.208 --> 16:45.041
REMIND ME TO SEND THEM
A THANK YOU CARD.

16:45.041 --> 16:46.333
WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE THEM UPSTAIRS

16:46.333 --> 16:47.667
AND OPEN THEM
IN YOUR ROOM.

16:47.667 --> 16:48.667
I'VE GOT A BETTER IDEA.

16:48.667 --> 16:50.000
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE 'EM
TO GOODWILL.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.500
DONATE 'EM TO SOMEBODY
WHO CARES.

16:51.500 --> 16:54.166
THAT IS NOT
AN APPROPRIATE ATTITUDE
FOR THE HOLIDAYS.

16:54.166 --> 16:56.834
YEAH, WELL,
MERRY F-IN' CHRISTMAS.

16:56.834 --> 17:00.500
JENNIFER! YOU KNOW,
YOU ARE QUITE POSSIBLY

17:00.500 --> 17:03.667
ONE OF THE MOST SPOILED,
SELF-INVOLVED BRATS

17:03.667 --> 17:05.875
I HAVE EVER HAD
THE DISPLEASURE
OF DEALING WITH.

17:05.875 --> 17:07.959
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

17:07.959 --> 17:09.500
WHY DON'T I
JUST GO TO MY ROOM.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.625
WHILE YOU'RE THERE,
WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE THE TIME

17:11.625 --> 17:14.125
TO FILL OUT
A COUPLE OF YOUR
COLLEGE APPLICATIONS?

17:14.125 --> 17:16.458
RIGHT. OF COURSE.

17:16.458 --> 17:18.791
ANYTHING TO GET ME
OUT OF THE HOUSE
QUICKER, HUH?

17:18.791 --> 17:20.500
THAT IS NOT
WHAT I MEANT.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.083
SO THEN WERE YOU TRYING
TO LIGHT A FIRE UNDER ME?

17:22.083 --> 17:24.875
I'M SORRY,
BUT YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN

17:24.875 --> 17:26.708
SO MUCH AS
A COMPLETE SENTENCE TO ME

17:26.708 --> 17:28.208
EVER SINCE
I DISAPPOINTED YOU.

17:28.208 --> 17:29.250
SO YOU DON'T GET
TO INSTILL ME WITH MOTIVATION.

17:29.250 --> 17:31.125
YOU DON'T GET
TO DISCUSS MY FUTURE.

17:31.125 --> 17:34.250
YOU LOST THAT RIGHT
WHEN YOU WROTE ME OFF.

17:40.375 --> 17:42.250
DAWSON, I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU'RE HAVING
SUCH A PROBLEM WITH THIS.

17:42.250 --> 17:44.583
I MEAN,
JUST TELL THEM THE TRUTH.

17:44.583 --> 17:47.417
THE TRUTH BEING WHAT,
EXACTLY?

17:47.417 --> 17:51.041
THAT FILMMAKING
WILL PROVIDE YOU
WITH EVERYTHING

17:51.041 --> 17:53.250
THAT A YOUNG MAN
COULD EVER WANT
OR NEED...

17:53.250 --> 17:55.041
A 3-PICTURE DEAL
WITH COLUMBIA

17:55.041 --> 17:56.500
AND A SPOT
JUST HIGH ENOUGH ON
THE PREMIERE  POWER LIST

17:56.500 --> 17:59.750
TO BAG YOURSELF
ONE OF THE GIRLS
OF THE WB.

18:01.875 --> 18:05.125
MOMENTS LIKE THIS IT BECOMES
GLARINGLY OBVIOUS

18:05.125 --> 18:07.250
JUST HOW RELATED TO PACEY
YOU REALLY ARE.

18:07.250 --> 18:08.542
COME ON. TAKE A BREAK.

18:08.542 --> 18:10.375
HELP ME
HANG THE MISTLETOE.

18:10.375 --> 18:11.917
OK.

18:13.708 --> 18:15.208
WHY DON'T YOU ASK
MR. BROOKS?

18:15.208 --> 18:16.750
ASK MR. BROOKS FOR WHAT?

18:16.750 --> 18:17.458
FOR HELP ON YOUR ESSAY.

18:17.458 --> 18:19.583
I DON'T THINK SO.

18:19.583 --> 18:21.000
I TOLD THE GUY
I LIKE HIS MOVIES,

18:21.000 --> 18:22.333
HE PRACTICALLY
TOOK MY HEAD OFF.

18:22.333 --> 18:26.083
OH, DAWSON,
SAY WHAT YOU WANT
ABOUT HIS MERCURIAL MOODS,

18:26.083 --> 18:28.375
BUT THE GUY IS A RESOURCE.
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIM.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.208
HE'S PROBABLY
ONE OF THE ONLY GUYS
YOU'VE MET

18:30.208 --> 18:31.917
WHO'S A REAL-LIFE FILMMAKER.

18:31.917 --> 18:34.291
AND MAYBE
A CONVERSATION WITH HIM
WILL CLEAR YOUR HEAD.

18:34.291 --> 18:36.000
YOU KNOW,
GET RID OF THE COBWEBS.

18:38.625 --> 18:40.375
IS THERE A POINT
TO WHAT WE'RE DOING?

18:40.375 --> 18:41.375
WHO CARES? IT'S TRADITION.

18:41.375 --> 18:45.000
AND YOU DON'T MONKEY
WITH TRADITION.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.917
WHAT?

18:46.917 --> 18:48.959
I NEVER HAD YOU PEGGED
AS A TRADITIONALIST.

18:48.959 --> 18:50.834
IT'S CUTE.

18:53.625 --> 18:55.125
Grams: ACTUALLY,
YOU WERE RIGHT.

18:55.125 --> 18:56.166
SHE HASN'T FILLED OUT
ONE APPLICATION,

18:56.166 --> 18:58.750
AND SHE'S NOT GOING TO.

18:58.750 --> 19:01.458
WELL, MAYBE WE CAN TALK TO HER.
YOU KNOW, GANG UP ON HER.

19:01.458 --> 19:02.750
OH, THAT WON'T WORK.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.750
I KNOW MY GRANDDAUGHTER.
SHE'S FAR TOO STUBBORN

19:04.750 --> 19:07.625
TO STAND FOR ANYTHING
EVEN RESEMBLING
AN INTERVENTION.

19:07.625 --> 19:09.291
YEAH, I KNOW.

19:09.291 --> 19:12.458
WELL, ANY BETTER IDEAS?

19:12.458 --> 19:14.834
ACTUALLY, I DO,

19:14.834 --> 19:16.959
AND I'M GOING TO NEED
YOUR HELP.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.375
Dawson: MR. BROOKS?

19:32.834 --> 19:35.542
[KNOCKING]

19:35.542 --> 19:37.125
MR. BROOKS!

19:39.000 --> 19:40.500
MY GOD, KID!

19:40.500 --> 19:41.875
YOU SCARED THE CRAP
OUTTA ME.

19:41.875 --> 19:44.000
I'M SORRY.
I KNOCKED.
YOU DIDN'T HEAR ME.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.125
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST LEAVE?

19:45.125 --> 19:47.625
UH, 'CAUSE I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU.

19:47.625 --> 19:50.500
IF YOU CAME TO ASK IF I SLEPT
WITH MARILYN MONROE,

19:50.500 --> 19:52.291
YOU CAN CRAWL BACK
FROM WHENCE YOU CAME.

19:52.291 --> 19:55.417
NO, IT'S NOTHING
LIKE THAT. I--

19:55.417 --> 19:56.708
DID YOU?

19:56.708 --> 19:59.792
HUH. WHAT IS IT
I CAN DO FOR YOU,
MR. LEERY?

20:01.125 --> 20:02.208
I NEED SOME ADVICE.

20:02.208 --> 20:04.625
HAVE YOU TRIED
THE TEEN HELP LINE?

[CLEARS THROAT]

20:06.000 --> 20:08.166

CLEARLY TAKE LONGER
THAN I'D HOPED,

BUT I SUPPOSED
I COULD GIVE YOU A--

20:10.875 --> 20:12.917
WOULD YOU LIKE
A SODA POP, MR. LEERY?

20:12.917 --> 20:14.542
NO, THANK YOU.
I'M FINE.

20:14.542 --> 20:17.708
ALL RIGHT. I'M READY
TO DISPENSE ADVICE.
SIT DOWN.

20:17.708 --> 20:20.917
UM...

20:20.917 --> 20:24.375
WELL, I--

20:24.375 --> 20:27.041
I'VE GOT TO WRITE
THIS ESSAY--

20:27.041 --> 20:30.375
AN APPLICATION
FOR USC FILM SCHOOL,
AND...

20:30.375 --> 20:35.333
IT'S KILLING ME.
I CAN'T...

20:35.333 --> 20:36.917
FOR THE LIFE OF ME
ANSWER THE QUESTION,

20:36.917 --> 20:37.875
"WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE
A FILMMAKER?"

20:37.875 --> 20:40.417
WELL, WHY DO YOU, KID?

20:40.417 --> 20:41.625
WELL,
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

20:41.625 --> 20:43.708
I'M HAVING TROUBLE
PUTTING IT INTO WORDS.

20:43.708 --> 20:45.083
IF YOU CAN'T DO BETTER
THAN THAT,

20:45.083 --> 20:47.959
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
MAKE OUT AN APPLICATION
TO McDONALD'S.

20:50.708 --> 20:52.291
MR. BROOKS,
I NEED TO KNOW WHY

20:52.291 --> 20:53.500
YOU STOPPED
MAKING MOVIES.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.917
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH ANYTHING?

20:55.917 --> 20:57.083
'CAUSE I'VE STOPPED,
TOO.

20:57.083 --> 20:58.959
WELL, THAT'S A TRAGIC LOSS
FOR THE ARTS.

FULL-STEAM AHEAD.

WAS GONNA STOP ME,

A CRISIS OF FAITH.

21:26.917 --> 21:29.417
YOU KNOW,

21:29.417 --> 21:33.291
I THOUGHT WE WERE
BEYOND THIS.

21:33.291 --> 21:35.667
I THOUGHT
WE HAD MOVED ON,

21:35.667 --> 21:37.375

WAS TO EQUATE TALENT

AND KINDNESS, SO...

22:02.959 --> 22:04.625
SURE.

22:07.792 --> 22:09.750

WE COULD ALWAYS
JUST TURN AROUND.

BE INCREDIBLY COWARDLY.

YET SOUNDS
INCREDIBLY APPEALING.

YOU'RE GRINNING
LIKE AN IDIOT.

22:18.875 --> 22:20.583
YEAH, I KNOW.
I CAN'T HELP IT.

ABOUT WHAT
YOU SAID TO ME
THE OTHER NIGHT.

23:38.375 --> 23:40.417
TO ONE OF THE BEST
FILM SCHOOLS
IN THE COUNTRY,

AND I'M NOT EVEN SURE
I WANT TO GO.

23:41.583 --> 23:44.250
I'M NOT SURE
I DESERVE TO GO.

WHAT YOU SOUND LIKE, DAWSON?

WHO JUST BROKE UP
WITH THIS GIRL.

AND HE'S HAPPY
HE BROKE UP WITH HER--

23:52.125 --> 23:53.959
I MEAN, AT LEAST
HE SAYS HE IS--

23:53.959 --> 23:55.417
AND HE GOES ON AND ON
ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

23:55.417 --> 23:57.083
HOW MUCH BETTER OFF
HE IS WITHOUT HER,

23:57.083 --> 23:58.417

HE CAN'T STOP TALKING
ABOUT HER.

TO THIS GIRL.

HAS NOT KEPT HER

FROM BREAKING MY HEART
TIME AGAIN.

DOESN'T MATTER.

ADMIT THAT YOU LOVE MOVIES,

GOOD ENOUGH FOR FIRST,

NO, I DIDN'T.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.542
YES, YOU DID,

26:08.542 --> 26:11.166
AND YOUR ESSAYS
WERE WONDERFUL.

26:11.166 --> 26:13.417
THEY WERE?

26:13.417 --> 26:14.500
YES, THEY WERE.

26:14.500 --> 26:16.125
YOU SHOULD BE VERY PROUD
OF YOURSELF.

I GUESS.

26:38.542 --> 26:41.458
WHY DON'T YOU TELL US
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOURSELF?

26:41.458 --> 26:42.708
UM...

26:42.708 --> 26:46.583
THERE'S REALLY
NOT MUCH TO TELL.

26:46.583 --> 26:48.917

AVERAGE TEENAGE GIRL.

26:48.917 --> 26:51.166
HAVING REVIEWED
YOUR APPLICATION,

26:51.166 --> 26:52.250
I HARDLY THINK SO.

26:52.250 --> 26:54.583
I SEEM TO REMEMBER
A CERTAIN FONDNESS FOR ART.

26:54.583 --> 26:57.917
HAVE YOU BEEN TO
THE NEW GUGGENHEIM?

26:57.917 --> 27:01.542
NO, BUT I HAVE
ALWAYS WANTED
TO GO TO NEW YORK.

27:01.542 --> 27:06.000
IT'S ACTUALLY
IN BILBAO, HON.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.291
SPAIN?

27:07.291 --> 27:10.208
WHICH ISN'T IMPORTANT.

27:10.208 --> 27:13.000
WHAT IS, HOWEVER,
IS THE BUILDING ITSELF.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.667
IT'S REALLY
THE MOST AMAZING FEAT
OF CONSTRUCTION.

27:16.667 --> 27:19.458
IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY
COMBINATION

27:19.458 --> 27:21.792
OF INTERSECTING SHAPES.

27:21.792 --> 27:23.667
IT'S AN ARCHITECTURAL
EPIPHANY.

27:23.667 --> 27:25.166
NO, I DON'T KNOW.

27:25.166 --> 27:26.917
YOU ASK ME,
THE THING JUST LOOKS
LIKE A BIG ARTICHOKE.

27:31.667 --> 27:33.208
NO, I'M SERIOUS.
IT DOES.

27:33.208 --> 27:34.417
OH, SO YOU'VE BEEN?

27:34.417 --> 27:35.458
NO,
BUT MY BROTHER--

27:35.458 --> 27:36.750
HE'S THIS BIG
ARCHITECTURE BUFF,

27:36.750 --> 27:37.917
AND HE'S INTO THOSE
COFFEE TABLE ART BOOKS.

ALL THE PICTURES,

AND I'M HERE
TO TELL YOU,

27:41.083 --> 27:43.500
IT LOOKS LIKE
A BIG ARTICHOKE.

BIG ARTICHOKE.

27:53.875 --> 27:55.834
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT DOES LOOK LIKE
AN ARTICHOKE.

28:19.792 --> 28:22.041
OH, NO.
I'M NOT MUCH FOR CROWDS.

28:22.041 --> 28:24.834
WHY IS THAT NOT A SURPRISE?

28:24.834 --> 28:26.375
IS THERE SOMETHING
I CAN DO FOR YOU?

28:26.375 --> 28:27.667
AH.

28:34.041 --> 28:35.792
THE BEST FILM CRITIC
EVER WAS.

28:35.792 --> 28:37.708
SHE SAYS IT A LOT BETTER
THAN I EVER COULD.

28:37.708 --> 28:39.291
SAYS WHAT?

28:39.291 --> 28:41.041
WHY.

28:41.041 --> 28:42.834
WHY WHEN I WAS A KID

28:42.834 --> 28:45.542
I LIVED FOR
SATURDAY AFTERNOONS
AT THE RIALTO.

28:45.542 --> 28:47.291
WHY I LEFT THIS TOWN
THE DAY I GRADUATED
HIGH SCHOOL,

28:47.291 --> 28:50.875
AND HOPPED ON
A TRAIN HEADED
FOR THE LOS ANGELES.

28:50.875 --> 28:53.250
WHY I ALMOST CRIED
THE FIRST TIME

28:53.250 --> 28:55.458
I STEPPED ON
A STUDIO LOT.

28:55.458 --> 28:58.041
AND WHY I DID THE FIRST TIME
I YELLED, "ACTION!"

29:01.375 --> 29:03.750
SORRY I SNAPPED AT YOU, KID.

29:03.750 --> 29:06.500
YOU JUST HAPPENED
TO SCRATCH AN OPEN WOUND

29:06.500 --> 29:07.708
THAT STILL HASN'T HEALED
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.

29:07.708 --> 29:11.208
WHICH IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

29:11.208 --> 29:14.417
1956 LOUIS B. MAYER
CALLS ME INTO HIS OFFICE.

29:14.417 --> 29:15.667
HE'S GOT THIS
BRILLIANT IDEA.

29:15.667 --> 29:18.917
WANTS TO CAST MY BEST FRIEND
AND MY GIRLFRIEND

29:18.917 --> 29:20.291
IN MY NEXT PICTURE.

29:20.291 --> 29:21.959
TURN AWAY, MY SWEET.

29:21.959 --> 29:24.125
WELL, I GOT
TO AGREE WITH HIM.

29:24.125 --> 29:25.667
IT'S GREAT CASTING.

29:25.667 --> 29:27.625
TILL WE STARTED SHOOTING
AND I AM A MADMAN.

29:27.625 --> 29:28.875
CRAZED BEYOND BELIEF.

29:28.875 --> 29:31.291
I DON'T EVEN NOTICE
WHAT'S HAPPENING

29:31.291 --> 29:32.542
RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY EYES.

29:32.542 --> 29:36.125
MY BEST FRIEND FALLING IN LOVE
WITH MY GIRLFRIEND.

29:36.917 --> 29:38.542
BY THE TIME I REALIZE IT,

29:38.542 --> 29:40.417
IT'S TOO LATE. SHE'S GONE,

29:40.417 --> 29:42.583
AND I STILL HAVE
HALF A PICTURE TO DIRECT.

29:42.583 --> 29:44.583
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THAT'S LIKE?

29:44.583 --> 29:47.125
I WOULD IMAGINE
IT WOULD BE TERRIBLE.

29:47.125 --> 29:48.875
YEAH, MADE ME
HATE DIRECTING,

29:48.875 --> 29:51.166
EVERYBODY,
AND EVERYTHING.

29:51.166 --> 29:54.125
THE DAY WE WRAPPED
I CAUGHT ANOTHER
TRAIN...

29:54.125 --> 29:58.458
FOR CAPESIDE, MASS.
I NEVER LOOKED BACK.

29:58.458 --> 30:01.333
STARTED A NEW LIFE.
STARTED A BETTER LIFE.

30:05.333 --> 30:06.458
MR. BROOKS?

30:06.458 --> 30:08.458
MR. BROOKS!

30:08.458 --> 30:10.500
WHAT?!

30:10.500 --> 30:13.417
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO COME INSIDE?

30:21.625 --> 30:23.333
WHY DO YOU WANT
TO MAKE PICTURES?

30:23.333 --> 30:26.417
[SIGHS]

30:27.959 --> 30:31.166
HOW CAN YOU EXPLAIN
THE THINGS YOU LOVE?

30:33.083 --> 30:34.708
YOU CAN'T. YOU JUST DO.

30:34.708 --> 30:37.125
GOD HELP YOU, KID.

30:41.250 --> 30:45.125
SO THEN THE RABBI SAYS,
"RECTUM? I DAMN NEAR
KILLED 'EM!"

30:45.125 --> 30:47.083
[LAUGHING]

30:47.083 --> 30:48.333
GOOD ONE, RIGHT?

30:48.333 --> 30:51.000
IT'S VERY GOOD.

30:51.000 --> 30:55.625
JOEY, I HAD NO IDEA
YOUR BOYFRIEND WAS
SUCH A CHARMER.

30:55.625 --> 30:57.542
WHO KNEW?

30:57.542 --> 31:01.375
WORTHINGTON COULD USE
A YOUNG MAN LIKE YOU,
PACEY.

31:01.375 --> 31:02.166
WHY HAVEN'T YOU APPLIED?

31:04.417 --> 31:06.333
YEAH, PACE,
WHY HAVEN'T YOU?

31:07.625 --> 31:11.959
WELL, I--

31:11.959 --> 31:14.667
TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST, UH,

31:14.667 --> 31:17.708
BOTH OF MY PARENTS
ARE REAL BIG LEFTIES,

31:17.708 --> 31:20.250
SO FOR ME IT'S
YALE OR NOTHING.

31:20.250 --> 31:22.291
WELL, THAT CERTAINLY
IS OUR LOSS.

31:25.458 --> 31:27.500
HEY, PACE, CAN
I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

31:27.500 --> 31:29.166
YEAH, SURE.

31:30.333 --> 31:33.041
OUTSIDE.

31:35.792 --> 31:37.208
EXCUSE US.

31:37.208 --> 31:38.708
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU JUST DID THAT.

31:38.708 --> 31:40.250
JUST DID WHAT?
YOU LIED!

31:40.250 --> 31:41.792
HOLD ON A SECOND--

31:41.792 --> 31:44.708
AFTER THAT WHOLE
PSEUDO-MOTIVATIONAL
DIATRIBE, YOU LIED.

31:44.708 --> 31:46.792
CAN I HAVE THE FLOOR?
WHY ARE YOU TRYING SO HARD

31:46.792 --> 31:48.166
TO IMPRESS THESE PEOPLE?
YOU DONE?

31:48.166 --> 31:49.166
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO YOU ARE RIGHT NOW.

31:49.166 --> 31:50.458
ALL I'M TRY--
EXCUSE ME, PACEY.

31:50.458 --> 31:52.708
EXCUSE ME.

31:52.708 --> 31:53.583
I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU
TO MEET THE DEAN.

31:53.583 --> 31:55.542
DO YOU MIND, JOEY?

31:55.542 --> 31:57.000
COURSE NOT.

32:01.333 --> 32:02.708
Pacey: SURE.

32:02.708 --> 32:05.166
[CHUCKLES]
HE'S A GREAT GUY.
AN OLD FRIEND.

32:05.166 --> 32:05.959
I'D LOVE FOR HIM
TO HEAR THE, UH...

32:05.959 --> 32:08.750
2 RABBIS.
YEAH. [LAUGHS]

32:08.750 --> 32:10.792
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
A PRETTY GOOD ONE.

32:40.417 --> 32:41.500
JACK.

32:41.500 --> 32:42.959
HEY.

32:42.959 --> 32:45.583
DID I NOT MAKE MYSELF
PERFECTLY CLEAR TO YOU?

32:45.583 --> 32:47.291
WHAT?
DID I
OR DID I NOT

32:47.291 --> 32:48.959
ASK YOU TO JUST
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS?

32:48.959 --> 32:50.125
AH, JEN--
NO, JACK,

32:50.125 --> 32:51.959
YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY RIGHT
TO DO WHAT YOU DID.

32:51.959 --> 32:54.208
HE HAD EVERY RIGHT.
AS DID I.

32:54.208 --> 32:56.750
LISTEN, I'M NOT LOOKING
TO BE SAVED HERE, ALL RIGHT?

32:56.750 --> 32:57.875
I DON'T WANT
TO GO TO COLLEGE.

32:57.875 --> 32:59.166
COULD YOU JUST LEAVE ME ALONE?

32:59.166 --> 33:00.792
YOU DO WANT TO GO
TO COLLEGE.

33:00.792 --> 33:03.333
I KNOW THAT FOR A FACT,
AND I KNOW WHY
YOU HAVEN'T APPLIED.

33:03.333 --> 33:04.625
NO, YOU DON'T.
YES, I DO.

33:04.625 --> 33:06.125
YOU HAVEN'T APPLIED
BECAUSE YOU REFUSED

33:06.125 --> 33:09.041
TO ASK YOUR PARENTS
FOR HELP.

33:09.041 --> 33:12.208
I--I CAN'T. I CAN'T KEEP
PUTTING MYSELF OUT THERE
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

33:12.208 --> 33:13.875
I WON'T ASK THEM.
I WON'T DO IT.

33:13.875 --> 33:15.417
AND I WON'T LET YOU.

33:15.417 --> 33:21.208
NOW, LOOK, I'M SORRY
THAT YOU HAVEN'T

33:21.208 --> 33:23.000
FELT LIKE YOU COULD
TALK TO ME LATELY,

33:23.000 --> 33:25.333
BUT YOU MUST UNDERSTAND
SOMETHING, JENNIFER.

33:25.333 --> 33:28.500
YOU MUST UNDERSTAND
THAT NO MATTER HOW ANGRY

33:28.500 --> 33:32.000
OR UPSET OR DISAPPOINTED
I MAY BE IN YOU,

33:32.000 --> 33:34.500
I WILL ALWAYS
BE THERE FOR YOU.

33:34.500 --> 33:36.708
YOU ARE GOING
TO COLLEGE, YOUNG LADY.

33:36.708 --> 33:39.542
IF I HAVE TO BEG,
BORROW, OR STEAL,
I WILL GET YOU THERE.

33:42.083 --> 33:46.625
YOU ARE
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
IN MY LIFE, JENNIFER,

33:46.625 --> 33:48.750
AND I LOVE YOU.

33:50.834 --> 33:53.333
I--I KINDA LOVE YOU, TOO.

33:59.083 --> 34:00.166
AW...

34:23.041 --> 34:24.333
HI, JOEY.

34:27.166 --> 34:29.166
UH, HI,
MR. KUBELIK, UM...

34:34.375 --> 34:37.667
I'M SORRY, I...

34:37.667 --> 34:38.875
I THINK I NEED
TO APOLOGIZE.

34:38.875 --> 34:42.000
REALLY? WHATEVER FOR?

34:45.708 --> 34:47.417
WELL, I THINK
I BLEW IT TONIGHT.

34:47.417 --> 34:53.542
AND IT'S JUST, UM, THIS
IS KIND OF A WHOLE NEW
WORLD FOR ME,

34:53.542 --> 35:00.542
AND I, UM, I DON'T
REALLY KNOW WHAT
TO DO OR WHAT TO SAY,

35:00.542 --> 35:02.875
AND I KNOW THAT I DON'T
FIT IN VERY WELL--

35:02.875 --> 35:06.250
JOEY, YOU DIDN'T
BLOW ANYTHING.

35:06.250 --> 35:09.333
YOUR ACADEMIC RECORD
STANDS ON ITS OWN.

35:09.333 --> 35:12.875
YOU'RE A STUNNINGLY BRIGHT
YOUNG LADY.

35:12.875 --> 35:16.750
NO ONE IS GRADING YOU
ON YOUR SOCIAL SKILLS.

35:16.750 --> 35:18.625
BE THAT AS IT MAY,
YOU COULDN'T ASK

35:18.625 --> 35:21.583
FOR A BETTER CHARACTER WITNESS
THAN THAT BOYFRIEND OF YOURS.

35:21.583 --> 35:26.250
SERIOUSLY. HE JUST TALKED
THE DEAN'S EAR OFF,
ALL ABOUT YOU.

35:26.250 --> 35:29.125
HOW YOU'VE CHANGED HIM,
HOW YOU'VE HELPED HIM.

35:29.125 --> 35:34.750
HOW HE COULDN'T IMAGINE
A BETTER LIFE THAN ONE
WITH YOU BY HIS SIDE.

35:34.750 --> 35:41.500
WHAT A RARE GIFT,
TO HAVE SOMEONE SAY
SUCH THINGS ABOUT YOU.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.792
SO, WHERE DID
I APPLY?

35:49.792 --> 35:56.708
UH, YOU APPLIED TO BARD,
BROWN, COLUMBIA, EMERSON,
AND SARAH LAWRENCE.

35:56.708 --> 35:58.625
OH, AND B.U.

35:58.625 --> 35:59.959
NICE.

35:59.959 --> 36:02.750
YOU KNOW, I HAD
TO RANSACK YOUR COMPUTER.

36:02.750 --> 36:07.834
WITH A LITTLE PRUNING,
THAT, UM, THAT PAPER YOU DID
ON WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE MOVEMENT

36:07.834 --> 36:09.500
MADE A REALLY GOOD ESSAY.

36:09.500 --> 36:11.291
REALLY? COOL.

36:11.291 --> 36:16.667
YEAH. YEAH, AND, YOU KNOW,
I STUMBLED ACROSS YOUR JOURNAL.

36:18.166 --> 36:20.125
OH.

36:21.834 --> 36:25.000
I DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU STILL HAD THOSE KIND
OF DREAMS ABOUT ME.

36:26.417 --> 36:27.333
MORE NOG?

36:27.333 --> 36:29.500
SURE.
LOVE SOME MORE NOG.

36:36.250 --> 36:37.959
YOU AGAIN.

36:37.959 --> 36:38.834
HAVE WE MET?

36:38.834 --> 36:40.417
YOU KNOW VERY WELL
WE'VE MET.

36:40.417 --> 36:41.792
I HAD THE DISTINCT
DISPLEASURE

36:41.792 --> 36:44.333
OF WATCHING YOU
YELLING AND SCREAMING
AT POOR DAWSON LEERY

36:44.333 --> 36:47.375
OVER NOTHING
BUT SOME SILLY BOAT
OF YOURS.

36:47.375 --> 36:49.917
IT WAS QUITE
THE LITTLE TANTRUM.

36:49.917 --> 36:51.291
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,
YOU PUT ME IN MY PLACE.

36:51.291 --> 36:53.625
I ADMIRE THAT
IN A WOMAN.

36:53.625 --> 36:55.875
OH, YOU FANCY YOURSELF
QUITE CHARMING, DON'T YOU?

36:55.875 --> 36:57.542
ON MY BETTER DAYS,
YES, I DO.

36:57.542 --> 37:00.458
ON YOUR BETTER DAYS,
I'D SAY YOUR MIND IS CLEARLY
PLAYING TRICKS ON YOU.

37:00.458 --> 37:03.250
WHICH IS UNDERSTANDABLE.
YOU ARE GETTING ON IN YEARS.

37:03.250 --> 37:06.583
I DID YELL AT THE KID,
BUT THAT'S BEFORE I GOT
TO KNOW HIM,

37:06.583 --> 37:09.875
BEFORE I REALIZED
HE'S NOT AN IDIOT,
JUST A NUISANCE.

37:09.875 --> 37:12.375
WELL, PERHAPS IN THE FUTURE
YOU WILL TAKE THE TIME

37:12.375 --> 37:15.000
TO GET TO KNOW A PERSON
BEFORE YOU DISMISS THEM.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.542
PERHAPS YOU MIGHT
DO THE SAME.

37:18.166 --> 37:20.125
PERHAPS.

37:29.625 --> 37:31.583
WHAT?

37:31.583 --> 37:33.083
YOU WERE FLIRTING
WITH GRAMS.

37:33.083 --> 37:35.708
HEH HEH. NONSENSE.

37:35.708 --> 37:36.708
THAT LOOKED
LIKE FLIRTING TO ME.

37:36.708 --> 37:37.834
YOU'D KNOW
IF I WAS FLIRTING.

37:37.834 --> 37:39.291
MATTER OF FACT, YOU
COULD PULL UP A SEAT

37:39.291 --> 37:41.583
AND TAKE
A LESSON OR TWO.

37:41.583 --> 37:42.750
HEH HEH.

37:42.750 --> 37:43.625
I SHOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN SURPRISED

37:43.625 --> 37:45.417
THAT YOU WERE
A MOVIE DIRECTOR.

37:45.417 --> 37:46.834
WHAT ELSE COULD HAVE
SATISFIED THAT MASSIVE EGO?

37:46.834 --> 37:49.583
LISTEN, JUST BECAUSE
WE SHARED A MOMENT
OUT THERE

37:49.583 --> 37:52.458
DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE
TO GET ALL CHUMMY.

37:52.458 --> 37:54.750
POINT TAKEN. AHEM.

37:54.750 --> 37:56.583
BUT I WANTED YOU
TO KNOW SOMETHING.

37:56.583 --> 37:58.708
WHAT?

37:58.708 --> 38:00.625
I THINK I'M READY
TO MAKE A MOVIE AGAIN.

38:00.625 --> 38:02.708
OH, "CRISIS
OF FAITH" OVER?

38:02.708 --> 38:03.542
I'LL ALERT THE MEDIA.

38:03.542 --> 38:05.500
ALL RIGHT,
LAUGH ALL YOU WANT.

38:05.500 --> 38:07.041
I INTEND TO.

38:07.041 --> 38:10.500
AHEM. WHAT IS THIS,
UM, PICTURE OF YOURS
GONNA BE ABOUT?

38:10.500 --> 38:13.667
YOU.

38:13.667 --> 38:17.583
EXCUSE ME? SAY THAT
AGAIN INTO MY GOOD EAR,
WOULD YOU?

38:17.583 --> 38:22.208
MY MOV--MY PICTURE IS
GOING TO BE ABOUT YOU.
YOUR LIFE STORY.

38:22.208 --> 38:24.792
WE'LL TALK LATER.

38:24.792 --> 38:27.375
ENJOY THE PARTY.

38:35.500 --> 38:38.166
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

38:40.500 --> 38:42.583
I DIDN'T APOLOGIZE,
PACE.

38:42.583 --> 38:45.041
WELL, NO, BUT YOU
WERE GOING TO.

38:45.041 --> 38:46.458
I WAS?

38:46.458 --> 38:51.625
YEAH, YOU WERE
GOING TO APOLOGIZE
FOR BITCHING ME OUT EARLIER.

38:51.625 --> 38:57.667
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU?
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO LIED.

38:57.667 --> 39:03.417
DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU
THAT MAYBE I WAS
DOING THAT ALL FOR YOU?

39:04.375 --> 39:05.458
AND HOW, EXACTLY,
DO I BENEFIT

39:05.458 --> 39:08.041
FROM YOUR DISTORTION
OF THE TRUTH?

39:09.000 --> 39:15.083
WELL, MAYBE I JUST
WANTED THESE PEOPLE

39:15.083 --> 39:19.000
TO SEE YOU THROUGH MY EYES
JUST FOR ONE NIGHT.

39:19.000 --> 39:24.208
TO SEE THIS GIRL,
THIS WOMAN,

39:24.208 --> 39:29.583
WHO HAS MORE CLASS
AND INTELLIGENCE

39:29.583 --> 39:32.667
AND BEAUTY AND GRACE

39:32.667 --> 39:36.542
THAN ANYONE ELSE WHO'S WALKING
THE FACE OF THE PLANET.

39:40.041 --> 39:44.208
AND MAYBE
THINGS LIKE THIS JUST COME
TUMBLING OUT OF MY MOUTH

39:44.208 --> 39:46.542
BECAUSE I HAPPEN
TO BE HEAD OVER HEELS
IN LOVE WITH YOU,

39:46.542 --> 39:49.750
BUT THE REALLY
SCARY THING IS--IS...

39:51.458 --> 39:53.542
I THINK THAT
THEY'RE TRUE.

40:01.083 --> 40:04.667
SORRY, PACE.

40:04.667 --> 40:08.041
I JUST WANTED TO IMPRESS
THESE PEOPLE SO BAD,

40:08.041 --> 40:11.500
YOU KNOW, TO FIT IN,
AND I COMPLETELY FROZE.

40:11.500 --> 40:13.208
HEY, THAT
DOESN'T MATTER.
YES, IT DOES!

40:13.208 --> 40:16.000
I'VE NEVER WANTED
ANYTHING SO BAD
IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.708
AND YOU--YOU JUST
FIT RIGHT IN BETTER
THAN I EVER WILL.

40:18.708 --> 40:21.083
BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING
AT STAKE FOR ME HERE, JO.

40:21.083 --> 40:23.375
I HAVE NOTHING TO PROVE
TO THESE PEOPLE.

40:23.375 --> 40:27.792
AND JO, THIS WORLD,
IT IS OPENING
ITS DOORS TO YOU.

40:27.792 --> 40:29.125
AND WHEN YOU
STEP THROUGH,

40:29.125 --> 40:33.917
YOU ARE GOING TO BE
SUCH AN AMAZING PART
OF ALL OF THIS.

40:35.500 --> 40:37.583
AND WHEREVER
YOU CHOOSE TO GO,

40:37.583 --> 40:41.542
YOU'RE DOING THEM THE FAVOR,
NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

40:52.750 --> 40:54.417
YOU KNOW, YOUR MOM
SHOULD GET A MEDAL.

40:54.417 --> 40:58.917
MOM? REALLY, WHY'S THAT?

40:58.917 --> 41:00.417
BECAUSE SHE RAISED
A PERFECT BOY.

41:00.417 --> 41:05.083
AND MAYBE THINGS
LIKE THAT JUST TUMBLE
OUT OF MY MOUTH

41:05.083 --> 41:08.875
BECAUSE I HAPPEN
TO BE HEAD OVER HEELS
IN LOVE WITH YOU,

41:08.875 --> 41:14.917
BUT THE SCARY THING IS,
I THINK IT'S TRUE.

41:23.625 --> 41:27.625
MM. OK. WHAT DO YOU SAY

41:27.625 --> 41:31.417
YOU AND I TAKE
OUR LITTLE MUTUAL ADMIRATION
SOCIETY ON THE ROAD?

41:31.417 --> 41:36.375
PLEASE, CAN WE GO
SOMEPLACE WE BOTH FIT IN?

41:37.458 --> 41:39.583
YEAH?
YEAH.

41:39.583 --> 41:41.625
THANKS.

41:52.959 --> 41:54.583
HEY.

41:54.583 --> 41:58.125
YOU DID
A VERY GOOD THING.

41:58.125 --> 41:59.750
YEARS FROM NOW,
I'M NOT GONNA REMEMBER

41:59.750 --> 42:01.875
WHAT THE HELL I GOT
FOR CHRISTMAS,

42:01.875 --> 42:04.166
BUT I WILL REMEMBER
WHAT IT FELT LIKE
TO SEE MY PARENTS SO HAPPY.

42:04.166 --> 42:06.583
SO THANK YOU.

42:06.583 --> 42:07.667
HEY...

42:07.667 --> 42:11.083
TOTAL SELFISHNESS
ON MY PART.

42:11.083 --> 42:12.166
THIS JUST TAKES ME
BACK TO A TIME

42:12.166 --> 42:14.458
BEFORE EVERYTHING
GOT SO COMPLICATED.

42:14.458 --> 42:16.208
WHY DON'T YOU QUIT FLIRTING
AND KISS HER?

42:16.208 --> 42:18.208
EXCUSE--

42:19.375 --> 42:21.917
YOU GOTTA BE
KIDDING ME.

42:21.917 --> 42:24.917
I HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

42:24.917 --> 42:27.375
OK, WELL, I GUESS
WE'D BETTER GET IT
OVER WITH, THEN.

42:27.375 --> 42:28.500
YOU THINK?

42:28.500 --> 42:29.542
IT'S TRADITION, DAWSON,

42:29.542 --> 42:30.250
YOU DON'T MONKEY
WITH TRADITION.

42:30.250 --> 42:31.875
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
