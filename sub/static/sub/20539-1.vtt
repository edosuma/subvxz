03:33.780 --> 03:35.747
- It's really fun!
- Yeah.

03:35.749 --> 03:38.082
You need to find us some action, Bee.

03:38.084 --> 03:40.151
Sideswipe is correct, lieutenant.

Continued inactivity could cause us

they might be dealing with

It's possible, mineral deposits

05:33.099 --> 05:34.499
are affecting my sensors.

05:34.501 --> 05:37.939
Well, if it is a Decepticon, it
sounds like an annoying road-hog,

05:37.964 --> 05:39.137
not a world-conqueror.

05:39.139 --> 05:41.005

13:33.180 --> 13:36.081
We can't yell for help
at the first bump in the road.

13:36.083 --> 13:39.150
Not after all we've been through
since we came to Earth.

13:40.753 --> 13:42.921
All right, that's true.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.923
But we really need to take an approach

13:44.925 --> 13:46.925
that's more thought-out,
considered and...

13:46.927 --> 13:51.796
By the book? Fine, fine! Can we
just get back to catching our 'Con?

13:51.798 --> 13:55.600
Remind me to thank Fixit
for these portable detectors.

13:55.602 --> 13:59.070
I have the 'Con's signal,
but it's all jangly.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.139
Probably that interference again.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.242
Up there.
The top of that butte.

14:04.244 --> 14:07.078
Per regulations,
I'll take the lead. Clear?

14:07.080 --> 14:08.343
Crystal.

14:08.749 --> 14:09.614
(<i> action theme playing</i> )

14:14.620 --> 14:17.533
STRONGARM: Okay, ha, ha. Let me through.

14:17.533 --> 14:18.830
I said I was going to lead,

14:18.830 --> 14:21.626
and you need to...
Sideswipe!

14:21.628 --> 14:24.329
SIDESWIPE ( laughing ):
Oh, I'm-I'm-I'm sorry, officer,

14:24.331 --> 14:26.164
did you say something?

14:26.166 --> 14:28.733
What was that?
I-I didn't... I-I missed it!

14:32.572 --> 14:34.739
( engines roaring )

14:38.177 --> 14:40.245
( gears whirring )

14:42.615 --> 14:45.684
( distant explosion
then whooshing noise )

14:47.920 --> 14:50.275
Tell me those are signal flares.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.859
( gasps )

14:54.861 --> 14:57.614
Missiles! Punch the gas,
or we're scrap!

15:04.652 --> 15:07.272
SIDESWIPE: This Stunticon
sure didn't do his homework.

15:07.274 --> 15:10.075
If we can spot a missile
from this far out,

15:10.077 --> 15:12.292
it's no problem to get out of its way.

15:22.683 --> 15:23.770
Whoa!

15:25.010 --> 15:27.893
Unless they're guided missiles!

15:29.328 --> 15:32.030
( whooshing growing louder )

15:36.836 --> 15:39.137
(<i> tense action theme playing</i> )

15:53.286 --> 15:54.919
SIDESWIPE: Does the procedure
manual cover this?

15:54.921 --> 15:58.056
STRONGARM: Yeah! It says drive
faster than the missiles!

16:08.867 --> 16:11.435
The missiles' reaction time
is phenomenal!

16:11.437 --> 16:13.384
It's almost as good as ours!

16:17.476 --> 16:18.736
Almost.

16:21.380 --> 16:23.681
Almost!
Strongarm, that's it!

16:23.683 --> 16:26.050
Swing around and drive toward me
as fast as you can!

16:26.052 --> 16:28.320
- Why would I...?
- Just do it!

16:36.028 --> 16:38.663
Will you tell me what the plan is?

16:38.665 --> 16:40.554
Veer left when I give the word!

16:40.633 --> 16:42.300
What's the word?

16:42.302 --> 16:46.204
- Not yet...
- Sideswipe. Sideswipe! Sideswipe!!

16:47.806 --> 16:49.067
Now!

16:52.844 --> 16:54.445
( energy crackling )

16:54.447 --> 16:56.447
( gears whirring )

16:57.382 --> 16:58.849
( grunts )

17:05.424 --> 17:07.491
Ugh.

17:08.827 --> 17:10.895
( groans )

17:15.834 --> 17:18.469
Let me guess, regulations say,

17:18.471 --> 17:21.038
"Take cover and get the rest
of the team involved?"

17:21.040 --> 17:23.183
And I thought you couldn't read.

17:23.542 --> 17:26.711
Strongarm to Scrapyard, urgent!
Come in Scrapyard!

17:26.713 --> 17:27.971
( radio static )
Ugh!

17:27.971 --> 17:30.761
- It's that crazy interference.
- Keep trying.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.116
( beeping )

17:32.118 --> 17:33.950
Strongarm to Scrapyard.

17:34.821 --> 17:37.139
Strongarm to Scrapyard.

17:39.524 --> 17:41.859
(<i> soft theme playing</i> )

17:41.861 --> 17:44.862
Come on, Russell!
You have this, you have this!

17:44.864 --> 17:46.997
Big kick now, big kick now!

17:46.999 --> 17:49.066
Hey, batta batta batta!

17:49.068 --> 17:51.068
Here we go, here we go!

17:51.070 --> 17:52.636
Ho, ho!

17:52.638 --> 17:53.971
Ha, ha!

17:53.973 --> 17:56.107
Hah!

17:57.885 --> 17:59.410
Knock this kick through, Rusty.

17:59.412 --> 18:02.180
- We want the lead at halftime.
- From this close?

18:02.182 --> 18:05.177
We might as well put the points
on the scoreboard now.

18:13.192 --> 18:14.425
( sighs )

18:14.427 --> 18:16.194
Ready!

18:16.196 --> 18:18.362
Hut-hut. Hike!

18:18.364 --> 18:19.830
( grunts )

18:28.207 --> 18:29.540
( grunts )

18:29.542 --> 18:30.780
- Ugh!
- Ugh!

18:30.878 --> 18:32.283
( whistle blows )

18:32.308 --> 18:34.167
That's halftime, everybody!

18:35.381 --> 18:37.715
That's the first one
you've missed in...

18:37.717 --> 18:39.657
I don't know how long.

18:44.823 --> 18:48.192
No biggie, no biggie.
Only down two points.

18:48.194 --> 18:50.795
No problem, get 'em in the second half.

18:50.797 --> 18:53.513
Super kicker, super kicker.

18:55.134 --> 18:59.605
Hey, Fixit. I finished the first index
of Cybertronian relics we've found.

18:59.605 --> 19:00.862
Now, should I send it to your...

19:00.862 --> 19:02.517
STRONGARM: <i>Strongarm to Command Center!</i>

19:02.517 --> 19:03.432
<i>Come in!</i>

19:03.743 --> 19:06.895
Fixit here with Lieutenant
Bumblebee, cadet. Go ahead.

19:07.180 --> 19:10.568
<i>Requesting immediate backup.
Situation critical.</i>

19:10.568 --> 19:12.616
Are you sure it's critical, Strongarm?

19:12.618 --> 19:14.834
Look, I know you want us to be
more by the book, but...

19:14.834 --> 19:16.492
<i>Yes, I'm sure, sir!</i>

19:16.656 --> 19:19.211
<i>Extra critical!
Extra-extra critical!</i>

19:19.225 --> 19:20.966
All right, we're on our way.

19:21.227 --> 19:23.625
Heh!
Aw, those kids.

19:27.799 --> 19:29.733
( beeping )

19:29.735 --> 19:32.903
Coordinates fixed on Strongarm's
and Sideswipe's positions.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.839
Thanks, Fixit. Well...

19:34.841 --> 19:37.014
at least the desert's pretty
this time of year.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.577
( GroundBridge powering up )

19:51.823 --> 19:53.891
( GroundBridge powering down )

19:57.162 --> 19:59.599
Over here! Hurry!

20:04.035 --> 20:05.703
What's the situation?

20:05.705 --> 20:08.751
- Does that Stunticon have some friends?
- No. Sir...?

20:08.751 --> 20:11.775
Has he claimed hostages
and is threatening to harm them?

20:11.777 --> 20:13.244
No! Listen...

20:13.246 --> 20:16.146
- Does he have cats?
- He has missiles!

20:16.148 --> 20:17.915
Guided ones.

20:17.917 --> 20:20.971
- Whew!
- Okay...

20:20.971 --> 20:23.053
Well, that makes things
a little more interesting.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.849
But still, one 'Con with some missiles
shouldn't be too tough.

20:25.975 --> 20:27.060
Not for all of us.

20:27.260 --> 20:30.439
You guys need to get used to the idea
that we can handle anything.

20:30.663 --> 20:33.144
You're overlooking a key fact.

20:36.601 --> 20:38.602
The nuclear waste disposal site!

20:38.604 --> 20:41.282
If a missile were to explode
against the desert floor,

20:41.282 --> 20:44.542
the concussion might damage
the underground containment facility.

20:44.544 --> 20:47.611
And create a leak that could
poison the entire state!

20:47.613 --> 20:50.648
All right, our key is gonna be
the element of surprise.

20:50.650 --> 20:53.117
The Decepticon doesn't know
that there are five of us.

20:53.119 --> 20:54.379
Actually, Bee,

20:54.379 --> 20:56.800
I think he has a pretty good idea.

20:58.124 --> 21:00.190
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

21:01.960 --> 21:03.961
BUMBLEBEE:
One for each of us.
