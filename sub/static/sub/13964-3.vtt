What is this place?

00:03.337 --> 00:05.004
[SIX] Hyperion-8: Galactic
Maximum Security

00:05.006 --> 00:06.005
Detention Facility.

00:06.007 --> 00:07.639
I want us to escape.

00:07.641 --> 00:09.141
What do you need?

00:09.142 --> 00:10.642
The crew of the Raza's not
getting off this rock alive.

00:10.644 --> 00:13.145
The warden's been
paid off. The fix is in.

00:13.147 --> 00:14.780
[gunfire]

00:14.782 --> 00:16.582
[TWO]
Android, get us out of here.

00:16.584 --> 00:19.151
I am unable to
establish a neural link.

00:19.153 --> 00:21.286
[TWO]
Is he gonna make it?

00:21.288 --> 00:22.721
--[ARAX] Friend of yours?
--[TWO] He was.

00:22.723 --> 00:25.024
The crew of the Raza
escaped last night.

00:25.026 --> 00:26.025
And our asset?

00:26.027 --> 00:27.426
Onboard the ship with them.

00:27.428 --> 00:28.660
Now let's go get them.

01:37.832 --> 01:38.831
[FIVE]
No!

01:38.833 --> 01:40.833
Nooo!

01:40.835 --> 01:42.434
[FIVE grunts]

01:45.139 --> 01:46.638
I got her.

01:51.245 --> 01:53.112
Who the hell are you?

01:54.315 --> 01:55.881
What're you doing on our ship?

02:20.141 --> 02:21.440
Those nanites of yours,
they keep you

02:21.442 --> 02:23.408
from getting drunk, too?

02:23.410 --> 02:26.712
Yeah, I think they might.

02:26.714 --> 02:30.282
Well, I guess there's a
downside to everything, huh?

02:40.761 --> 02:42.427
You miss him, don't you?

02:43.898 --> 02:46.665
You had me convinced
he was the traitor.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.867
Seemed like the
right call at the time.

02:51.939 --> 02:56.842
I know why he came onboard,
why he, uh, changed his face

02:56.844 --> 02:59.778
to look like Jace Corso.

02:59.780 --> 03:04.816
His wife was murdered, and you
were the number one suspect.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.487
[TWO]
He came for revenge.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.789
And when he had the chance,
he didn't take it.

03:11.725 --> 03:14.660
You and me and the rest of us
on this ship were all he had,

03:14.662 --> 03:19.364
and, heh... and now he's dead.

03:21.335 --> 03:25.237
The only question is now
what are we gonna do about it?

03:30.444 --> 03:32.711
You know, if I had to guess, I'd
say that it was the same guys

03:32.713 --> 03:36.582
who tried to off us
in prison, Traugott.

03:36.584 --> 03:38.417
You're really gonna take on
a whole corporation?

03:38.419 --> 03:39.851
It's not just Traugott.

03:39.853 --> 03:42.821
It's Ferrous and Mikkei and
the whole damn system.

03:42.823 --> 03:44.773
Mikkei helped us escape.

03:44.774 --> 03:46.724
[ONE] Because it was in
their interest to do so.

03:48.262 --> 03:49.461
They play us like puppets,

03:49.463 --> 03:51.930
and we play along;
we always have.

03:54.235 --> 03:56.401
So we're gonna
take them all on.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.008
[ARAX] The three of us
need to make sure

04:03.010 --> 04:04.710
we're on the same page.

04:04.712 --> 04:05.995
[NYX]
'Bout what?

04:05.996 --> 04:07.279
[ARAX]
Our situation on this ship.

04:07.281 --> 04:09.581
We're strangers to them.
We need to be careful.

04:09.583 --> 04:10.816
[DEVON] Oh, they had
their memories wiped.

04:10.818 --> 04:12.484
They're pretty much
strangers to each other.

04:12.486 --> 04:15.487
No, I saw how they were
in lockup. They're a team.

04:15.489 --> 04:18.390
They'd gladly sacrifice all
of us to protect each other.

04:18.392 --> 04:19.858
[NYX]
They're not all that bad.

04:19.860 --> 04:22.327
The kid gave me these clothes.

04:22.329 --> 04:23.629
Come on.

04:23.631 --> 04:26.265
They have no reason
to see us as a threat.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.537
Are you sure about that?

04:34.975 --> 04:37.309
For now you can move
freely back and forth

04:37.311 --> 04:38.877
between here and your quarters.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.612
The rest of the ship
is off limits.

04:40.614 --> 04:41.513
Why?

04:41.515 --> 04:42.881
'Cause we don't trust you.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.283
We helped you escape.

04:44.285 --> 04:46.518
More like you glommed
onto our plan.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.719
[ARAX]
I provided the riot.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.054
Without that, none of this
woulda happened.

04:49.056 --> 04:51.923
And you'd still be in
your cell, wouldn't you?

04:51.925 --> 04:55.827
[TWO] Look, you have
no reason to fear us.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.596
[ARAX laughs]

04:57.598 --> 04:59.398
[ARAX] Except the fact
that you're carrying guns

04:59.400 --> 05:00.932
and we're not.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.601
Get used to it.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.842
[THE ANDROID] We are 22.4
lightyears away from

05:10.844 --> 05:12.544
the nearest inhabited station.

05:12.546 --> 05:13.912
No one will find us out here.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.864
[TWO]
Ship status?

05:15.865 --> 05:17.815
All systems functioning
normally, yet I'm still unable

05:17.818 --> 05:19.818
to reestablish my neural link.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.520
Well, try to reset manually.

05:21.522 --> 05:22.921
We need that link.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.570
Anything?

05:39.373 --> 05:40.772
I'm afraid not.

05:42.543 --> 05:43.942
I don't get it.

05:43.944 --> 05:46.111
Why can't the ship
find your signal?

05:46.113 --> 05:47.979
I think I may have a theory.

05:53.787 --> 05:55.387
What are we looking for?

05:55.389 --> 05:57.022
Once she wouldn't cooperate
back at the prison,

05:57.024 --> 05:59.658
they started probing
her neural network.

06:02.096 --> 06:04.463
The procedure
was quite invasive,

06:04.465 --> 06:06.465
and as I suspected,
it appears to have damaged

06:06.467 --> 06:08.967
my higher functions,
including self-diagnostics

06:08.969 --> 06:10.469
and my neural link.

06:10.471 --> 06:11.937
Can your nanites fix it?

06:11.939 --> 06:16.041
Yes, but I will have to
shut down in the meantime.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.610
Well, how long?

06:18.612 --> 06:20.812
Approximately 32 hours.

06:22.383 --> 06:26.017
Well, we're not going anywhere,
so now's as good a time as any.

06:26.019 --> 06:27.619
Go ahead.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.627
[TWO]
That's odd.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.679
What is it?

06:37.680 --> 06:39.730
[TWO] The computer's
scanning the medical database.

06:39.733 --> 06:40.899
Why?

06:40.901 --> 06:43.135
Could just be a
routine systems check.

06:43.137 --> 06:44.870
[ARAX]
Two, this is Arax.

06:46.473 --> 06:47.706
Go ahead.

06:47.708 --> 06:50.442
I have a proposition for you.

06:50.444 --> 06:51.843
I'll be right there.

07:09.730 --> 07:12.097
[TWO]
So? Let's hear it.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.166
You can't stay out here forever.

07:14.168 --> 07:15.700
Obviously.

07:15.702 --> 07:18.637
[ARAX] You need somewhere
safe to resupply.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.672
It just so happens
I know a place.

07:20.674 --> 07:23.542
It's a hollowed-out asteroid
in the Arkeon system.

07:23.544 --> 07:27.646
It's fully stocked--
artificial G, hydroponics dome,

07:27.648 --> 07:29.214
everything you need.

07:29.216 --> 07:32.217
But the best part is their
remaining mineral composite

07:32.219 --> 07:36.788
is 80 percent lead,
zero EM penetration.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.557
I can help you out.

07:40.494 --> 07:42.894
You know, we've been wanted
for a really long time,

07:42.896 --> 07:47.232
and we've gotten along
just fine without any help.

07:47.234 --> 07:52.237
[ARAX] Lemme guess, sticking
to independent stations

07:52.239 --> 07:54.806
and colonies, filing
false registration,

07:54.808 --> 07:57.642
occasionally bribing
local officials.

07:59.713 --> 08:01.980
Do you really think
that's still gonna work?

08:05.085 --> 08:07.486
You escaped from
a galactic lockup.

08:07.488 --> 08:11.690
That is a level of defiance the
corporations just can't accept.

08:11.692 --> 08:14.826
And even your allies,
and I'm sure you have some,

08:14.828 --> 08:16.862
are gonna have to back off.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.799
Now, if you still think
this is business as usual...

08:23.170 --> 08:24.903
...you're dead wrong.

08:26.240 --> 08:30.275
Well, I'll take that
under advisement.

08:39.653 --> 08:44.089
[THREE]
Hey. How's that robot?

08:44.091 --> 08:46.825
She shut down to self-repair.
She'll be fine.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.660
I just thought it might be
nice if someone checked in

08:48.662 --> 08:51.162
on her once in a while.

08:51.164 --> 08:54.199
Knock yourself out.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.034
What's with you?

08:56.036 --> 08:58.169
Got the mother of all headaches.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.874
Ah, damn it!

09:02.876 --> 09:04.276
Ahh...

09:07.047 --> 09:08.647
Whew.

09:10.651 --> 09:12.784
Hey, you might wanna
take it easy with those.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.553
Thanks for the advice, doc.

09:18.625 --> 09:20.325
What're you doing in here?

09:20.327 --> 09:23.295
Headache. Very bad.

09:26.767 --> 09:27.832

09:28.835 --> 09:31.069

Isn't that a little weird,

09:31.070 --> 09:33.304
both of you getting really bad
headaches at the same time?

09:33.307 --> 09:34.873
Dunno.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.274
How do you feel?

09:36.276 --> 09:37.876
I'm fine.

09:39.212 --> 09:41.112
Guess it's just
coincidence then, hm?

09:42.349 --> 09:44.082
[FOUR]
Ahh...

09:44.084 --> 09:45.650
--Hey--

09:45.652 --> 09:46.851

in the infirmary.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.700
Three and Four are down.

10:01.702 --> 10:04.336

what happened.

10:04.338 --> 10:06.838
They just collapsed.
They're both unconscious.

10:12.613 --> 10:14.012

10:34.001 --> 10:36.101
Come on, wake up.

10:36.103 --> 10:38.236

10:57.658 --> 10:59.124
Yeah, everything's fine.

10:59.126 --> 11:00.509
You sure?

11:00.510 --> 11:01.893
You, uh, you seem
a little upset.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.261
No, I-I'm fine.

11:03.263 --> 11:04.829
Okay. Um.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.798
Listen, I-I know that
we don't know each other,

11:06.800 --> 11:08.333
and... we haven't really
had a chance to talk--

11:08.335 --> 11:10.268
Maybe some other time.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.870
[DEVON]
Oh.

11:24.284 --> 11:27.752
Okay, think. Think...

11:36.930 --> 11:38.163
There you are.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.765
'Kay...

11:40.767 --> 11:44.302
[ANDROID SIMULATION] This is not
normal operating procedure.

11:44.304 --> 11:47.739
Do you, uh, remember
anything from last time?

11:47.741 --> 11:50.442
There is a log showing
I was activated once before,

11:50.444 --> 11:52.911
but the file contains no data.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.345
Someone must have deleted it.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.181
Oh, weird.

11:56.183 --> 11:59.217
Anyway, the short version is,
you have no physical form,

11:59.219 --> 12:01.986
no neural link, you're
just a projection

12:01.988 --> 12:05.023
based on our android's
default settings.

12:05.025 --> 12:06.891
And now I'm gonna
need you to get past that

12:06.893 --> 12:08.293
so you can help me out.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.362
As you wish.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.366
Take a look at this.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.435
It's a recent diagnostic
of The Android.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.338
Unfortunate.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.140
Significant damage.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.908
She should shut herself
down completely

12:23.910 --> 12:25.477
and effect repairs immediately.

12:25.479 --> 12:28.246
Yeah, she already has,
but the question is,

12:28.248 --> 12:31.449
can I reactivate her before
her repairs are complete?

12:31.451 --> 12:33.251
I would advise against it.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.853
Her nanites will
have to reconfigure

12:34.855 --> 12:37.188
several million neural pathways.

12:37.190 --> 12:38.957
If you interrupt that
process, you could do

12:38.959 --> 12:40.325
even further damage.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.927
[sighs] I was afraid
you might say that.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.063
Why do you wish to
reactivate her early?

12:46.099 --> 12:48.166
My whole crew is down.

12:48.168 --> 12:51.336
They just collapsed, and I
have no idea what happened,

12:51.338 --> 12:53.805
and I'm stuck on this ship with
three complete strangers,

12:53.807 --> 12:55.907
so what the hell
am I supposed to do?!

12:57.277 --> 13:00.411
I have insufficient data to
present a reasonable response.

13:02.482 --> 13:04.082
[sighs]

13:11.024 --> 13:13.825
Hey, uh, have either
of you guys seen the others?

13:13.827 --> 13:16.461
[NYX]
Not for a while. Why?

13:16.463 --> 13:18.263
I think something's wrong.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.002
[ANDROID SIMULATION]
Any change?

13:24.004 --> 13:26.238
They're exactly
the way I left them.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.473
I mean, they're still breathing,
but... I can't wake them up,

13:28.475 --> 13:30.575
and it's been over an hour.

13:30.577 --> 13:33.011
Do you intend to wait until
your android's repair cycle

13:33.013 --> 13:35.346
is complete before
doing anything?

13:35.348 --> 13:36.915
I'm not sure.

13:36.916 --> 13:38.483
[ANDROID SIMULATION] Because
without a better understanding

13:38.485 --> 13:40.385
of your friends'
medical condition,

13:40.387 --> 13:43.087
that could be very dangerous.

13:43.089 --> 13:44.522
You said one of the
others was a doctor.

13:44.524 --> 13:45.957
Yeah, supposedly.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.125
Then maybe he could help.

13:47.127 --> 13:49.294
Or maybe he's the
one who did this!

13:49.296 --> 13:52.564
It happened before.
Some kind of neurotoxin.

13:52.566 --> 13:54.165
Why would he do that?

13:54.167 --> 13:56.067
I-I-I don't know,
to take the ship.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.168
[ANDROID SIMULATION]
Why would he spare you?

13:57.170 --> 13:58.353
I dunno.

13:58.354 --> 13:59.537
How would he get the
necessary materials onboard?

13:59.539 --> 14:01.239
[FIVE]
I don't know, okay?!

14:01.241 --> 14:03.842
I've got no clue how any
of this happened, o-or why,

14:03.844 --> 14:06.544
or who I'm supposed to trust!

14:06.546 --> 14:10.882
Then you're in a very
difficult situation.

14:10.884 --> 14:13.184
Yeah, that much
I figured out already.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.586
Thanks.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.458
I've got no choice...

14:28.635 --> 14:30.235
What the hell's going on?

14:32.005 --> 14:33.404
I need your help.

14:34.975 --> 14:36.274
[DEVON]
Strange.

14:36.276 --> 14:37.698
What?

14:37.699 --> 14:39.121
[DEVON] Well, they show all
the outward signs of a coma,

14:39.122 --> 14:40.544
but their brain activity
is unusually elevated,

14:40.547 --> 14:42.614
especially in the
medial temporal lobe.

14:42.616 --> 14:44.415
And do you have any
idea what's causing it?

14:44.417 --> 14:47.018
Well, there's no
obvious signs of trauma,

14:47.020 --> 14:49.921
no abnormal pathogens,
blood work seems clean.

14:49.923 --> 14:51.556
[ARAX]
We should scan Two as well.

14:51.558 --> 14:55.226
[FIVE] No, you'll just
get the same results.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.628
There's no point.

15:01.534 --> 15:04.469
Look, Kid, um...
I know a safe place where

15:04.471 --> 15:06.771
we can lay low for a while.

15:06.772 --> 15:09.072
They've got a medical facility
better than what you have here.

15:10.343 --> 15:12.243
Might be their only chance.

15:28.695 --> 15:32.931
[FIVE] All right...
you've got navigation.

15:35.368 --> 15:37.535
You're gonna have to
give me a few minutes.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.504
The system's not
what I'm used to.

15:40.507 --> 15:42.373
'Kay, well, don't take too long.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.208
I'm gonna go check on Two.

15:44.210 --> 15:45.610
[ARAX]
Hmm.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.078
[FIVE]
Two?

16:24.517 --> 16:26.117
Two?

16:26.118 --> 16:27.718
Two, if you're hearing me,
please respond.

16:35.028 --> 16:35.994
Arax, finally.

16:35.996 --> 16:38.062
I've been waiting for your call.

16:44.004 --> 16:44.736
Something wrong?

16:44.738 --> 16:46.137
It's Two. She's gone.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.205
What do you mean she's gone?

16:47.206 --> 16:48.272
Well, I left her
in her quarters.

16:48.274 --> 16:49.774
I even locked the door.

16:49.775 --> 16:51.275
Well, she must have come to,
opened the door from the inside.

16:51.277 --> 16:53.244
Except she's not
answering her com.

16:53.246 --> 16:55.213
[NYX]
Well, maybe she collapsed again.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.716
[NYX]
Look, don't worry.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.318
We'll find her.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.021
I'll check the mess.

17:03.023 --> 17:04.756
You check between here
and the infirmary.

17:04.758 --> 17:06.357
Okay.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.600
[FIVE]
Two?

17:15.602 --> 17:17.402
Where the hell did she go...?

17:17.404 --> 17:18.603
[TWO]
Okay, that's far enough.

17:18.605 --> 17:19.337
My god, you're all right.

17:19.339 --> 17:20.738
Don't move.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.641
What are you doing?

17:23.643 --> 17:25.676
Took the words
right out of my mouth.

17:25.678 --> 17:27.045
[FIVE]
I was looking for you.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.546
Something happened.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.314
You collapsed.

17:30.316 --> 17:32.483
I didn't want Devon to
take you to the infirmary.

17:32.485 --> 17:35.586
I don't know who Devon is,
and I don't know who you are.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.199
What?

17:37.200 --> 17:38.811
[TWO] What I do know
is that if I don't start

17:38.812 --> 17:40.423
getting some answers,
I'm gonna blow your head off.

17:45.498 --> 17:48.266
[FIVE] What do you mean
you don't know me?

17:48.268 --> 17:50.635
Should I?

17:50.637 --> 17:52.403
We've been living
and working together

17:52.405 --> 17:53.805
on this ship for months.

17:53.807 --> 17:56.140
I don't think so.

17:56.142 --> 17:57.341
You lost your memory again.

17:57.343 --> 17:59.343
[PORTIA]
My memory is fine.

17:59.345 --> 18:01.546
I remember what I had
for lunch yesterday.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.614
What I don't remember is
some little green-haired girl

18:03.616 --> 18:06.150
sitting at the table. Ever.

18:06.152 --> 18:07.518
This doesn't make any sense.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.487
You are trying my patience.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.423
But you woke up on the
floor of your room, right?

18:12.425 --> 18:14.092
Doesn't that seem
a little bit odd?

18:14.094 --> 18:15.726
Maybe we partied a
little too hard last night.

18:15.728 --> 18:18.262
No, your nanites would
protect you from that.

18:18.264 --> 18:19.864
What did you say?!

18:19.866 --> 18:21.732
Your nanites.

18:21.734 --> 18:24.836
I know about your nanites,
because we're friends.

18:24.838 --> 18:26.237
Rook sent you.

18:26.239 --> 18:27.572
[FIVE]
No.

18:27.574 --> 18:30.274
I'm gonna send you back
in a body bag.

18:30.276 --> 18:31.242
[ARAX]
The hell's going on?

18:31.244 --> 18:32.643
[FIVE]
No!

18:33.613 --> 18:38.683
[grunting]

18:44.390 --> 18:45.723
--[bones cracking]
--[ARAX yells]

18:45.725 --> 18:47.325
[BOTH grunting]

19:04.144 --> 19:05.176
Hey, you're awake?

19:05.178 --> 19:10.248
[DEVON gurgling, wheezing]

19:13.786 --> 19:15.386
What's going on?

19:22.862 --> 19:24.795
[MARCUS]
Who's your friend?

19:24.797 --> 19:26.597
I have no idea.

19:26.599 --> 19:28.299
How did we get in here?

19:29.169 --> 19:31.302
You got me.

19:31.304 --> 19:33.704
The last thing I remember
is having a couple drinks,

19:33.706 --> 19:35.940
hit the sack, and
then I wake up in here.

19:37.443 --> 19:38.943
[RYO]
It's The Android.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.645
Looks like she's offline.

19:40.647 --> 19:43.414
'Kay, shit just
keeps getting weirder.

19:45.585 --> 19:47.251
[PORTIA]
Boone, you read me?

19:47.253 --> 19:49.320
Yeah.

19:49.322 --> 19:51.522
We've got intruders onboard.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.124
[MARCUS]
No kidding.

19:53.125 --> 19:54.725
Ryo just took one of them down.

19:54.727 --> 19:57.195
[PORTIA]
Was it a girl? Teenager?

19:57.197 --> 19:59.297
[MARCUS]
It's a guy in his twenties.

19:59.299 --> 20:00.731
Then she's still out there.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.533
Go find her.

20:02.535 --> 20:03.401
I'll start looking.

20:03.403 --> 20:04.802
Secure him.

20:05.471 --> 20:06.871
[door hisses]

20:33.933 --> 20:37.868
Hey, Boss Lady, you mind
filling me in on the details?

20:37.870 --> 20:39.870
I'm a little hazy here.

20:39.872 --> 20:41.672
[PORTIA]
You know as much as I do.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.007
First, we'll secure the ship,

20:43.009 --> 20:44.875
then we'll figure
out what happened.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.477
Roger that.

21:02.829 --> 21:04.428
I got her.

21:06.599 --> 21:07.965
I'm telling you
we work together.

21:07.967 --> 21:10.968
We escaped from prison together.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.970
I even saved your life once.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.572
Yeah, right.

21:25.585 --> 21:26.851
Got 'em all locked up.

21:26.853 --> 21:28.419
[PORTIA]
Did they say anything?

21:28.421 --> 21:31.422
Yeah, kid wouldn't
stop talking.

21:31.424 --> 21:33.291
Don't buy a word of it.

21:33.293 --> 21:35.860
Well, it may not be
as crazy as it seems.

21:35.862 --> 21:37.495
What are you talking about?

21:37.497 --> 21:38.996
[PORTIA] I dropped us out
so we could hang tight

21:38.998 --> 21:40.865
until we get a handle on things.

21:40.867 --> 21:42.800
Then I started checking systems.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.836
Everything seemed fine
until I looked at the date.

21:45.838 --> 21:48.005
We've got over a year
of missing time.

21:48.007 --> 21:49.440
[MARCUS]
That's insane.

21:49.442 --> 21:51.609
[PORTIA]
Yeah.

21:51.610 --> 21:53.777
Went to bed last night,
woke up 14 months later.

21:56.582 --> 21:58.482
Nah, they're bluffing.

21:58.484 --> 22:00.451
They just screwed
with our computers.

22:00.453 --> 22:02.019
Why would they do that?

22:02.021 --> 22:03.688
How the hell should I know?

22:04.657 --> 22:06.857
What if she's telling the truth?

22:07.960 --> 22:09.960
She said we were
trying to go straight,

22:09.962 --> 22:12.096
turn over a new leaf.

22:12.098 --> 22:14.498
That sound like the truth?

22:14.500 --> 22:16.467
It does seem unlikely.

22:19.906 --> 22:21.672
Fourteen months, huh?

22:26.379 --> 22:28.346
Shit.

22:28.348 --> 22:29.747
The vault.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.116
Go with him.

22:32.118 --> 22:33.984
Make sure he doesn't
do anything stupid.

22:39.692 --> 22:40.825
[MARCUS]
You changed the lock.

22:40.827 --> 22:41.943
I don't know what
you're talking--

22:41.944 --> 22:43.060
[MARCUS]
The vault, the pass code.

22:43.062 --> 22:44.695
Back off.

22:44.697 --> 22:47.181
You changed it.

22:47.182 --> 22:49.666
[FIVE] Yeah, WE changed it,
actually, several times.

22:49.669 --> 22:51.435
You're coming with me,
and you're gonna open it up.

22:51.437 --> 22:52.653
Okay.

22:52.654 --> 22:53.870
I can do that,
but I can tell you right now

22:53.873 --> 22:55.406
you're not gonna like
what you find.

22:55.408 --> 22:56.574
What's that supposed to mean?

22:56.576 --> 22:58.142
There was a lot of
money in there.

22:58.144 --> 23:00.778
We spent most of it,
but I-I think it's Sara

23:00.780 --> 23:02.580
you're worried about, right?

23:02.582 --> 23:03.981
You know about her.

23:05.151 --> 23:07.651
[FIVE]
There was an accident.

23:07.653 --> 23:10.454
We were under attack.

23:10.456 --> 23:13.457
Her stasis pod lost power,
and she didn't make it.

23:22.101 --> 23:23.134
You're lying.

23:23.136 --> 23:25.069
Why would I lie about that?

23:30.109 --> 23:31.709
I'm sorry.

24:01.207 --> 24:02.807
Sit.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.209
[RYO]
Well?

24:05.211 --> 24:09.213
Kid was right.
'Bout the vault, anyway.

24:09.215 --> 24:11.615
Money's gone.

24:11.617 --> 24:13.751
Sara's gone.

24:13.753 --> 24:15.152
What's that?

24:16.055 --> 24:18.088
[MARCUS]
It's one of my lock boxes.

24:34.674 --> 24:37.575
Found this with her stuff
after I put her in stasis.

24:39.812 --> 24:42.513
Was going to give it back
to her when she got better.

24:44.884 --> 24:47.885
[RYO] I have to say, I'm
surprised to see you display

24:47.887 --> 24:50.521
this much sentimentality.

24:50.523 --> 24:51.922
It's unexpected.

24:58.164 --> 24:59.897
You won't see it again.

25:06.272 --> 25:07.972
What is she doing here?

25:10.109 --> 25:12.576
We needed her help.

25:12.578 --> 25:13.277
I'll take her back.

25:13.279 --> 25:16.013
No, it's fine.

25:16.015 --> 25:18.849
She might be able
to help confirm my theory.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.251
What theory?

25:21.287 --> 25:23.621
I figured it out.

25:23.623 --> 25:25.222
I know what happened to us.

25:32.098 --> 25:35.065
What's the last thing
you remember before today?

25:35.067 --> 25:36.600
Getting drunk.

25:36.602 --> 25:38.235
Before that.

25:38.237 --> 25:40.538
[RYO] We were planning our
mission to Ellara Six.

25:40.540 --> 25:42.072
The only way in was
to use The Android

25:42.074 --> 25:43.941
to penetrate the biofield.

25:43.943 --> 25:45.276
[PORTIA]
Exactly.

25:45.278 --> 25:47.278
There was a chance
that The Android

25:47.279 --> 25:49.279
could become compromised,
so each of us uploaded

25:49.282 --> 25:51.982
a brain scan to the computer
to give it a pattern

25:51.984 --> 25:54.685
to recognize and
possibly link with.

25:54.687 --> 25:56.954
We were gonna
test it the next day.

25:56.956 --> 25:58.456
Oh my god.

25:58.457 --> 25:59.957
[MARCUS] That was supposed
to be a last resort.

25:59.959 --> 26:02.192
What?

26:02.194 --> 26:05.062
Back at the prison,
they damaged The Android.

26:05.064 --> 26:06.063
She couldn't link.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.131
That's why she's offline.

26:07.133 --> 26:09.767
But before that,
you set the computer

26:09.769 --> 26:11.802
to search for active links.

26:13.606 --> 26:15.339
And it's been doing
that ever since.

26:15.341 --> 26:19.209
Except somehow in
trying to link with you,

26:19.211 --> 26:22.913
it reset you to the day that
you uploaded those scans.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.848
I don't have a neural
link in my brain, kid,

26:24.850 --> 26:25.649
just a headache.

26:25.651 --> 26:27.368
What about you?

26:27.369 --> 26:29.086
--[RYO] No.
--I can link.

26:29.088 --> 26:30.688
[FIVE]
Really?

26:31.724 --> 26:33.891
Yes.

26:33.893 --> 26:37.628
The ship is like an
extension of my own body;

26:37.630 --> 26:43.000
shields, engines, weapons...

26:43.002 --> 26:46.337
It's an incredible rush.

26:46.339 --> 26:47.805
Okay.

26:47.807 --> 26:51.308
So you can control
all the systems.

26:51.310 --> 26:53.911
Not yet.

26:53.913 --> 26:58.282
This ship is extremely complex,
but I'll get it.

26:59.885 --> 27:01.819
Fine.

27:01.821 --> 27:03.754
Next question,
what do we do with them?

27:03.756 --> 27:04.888
[RYO]
Can't keep them onboard.

27:04.890 --> 27:06.223
They're a liability.

27:06.225 --> 27:07.658
[MARCUS]
Agreed.

27:07.660 --> 27:09.226
Just so happens that
I know a black market

27:09.228 --> 27:11.962
serillium operation that'd
be happy to have 'em.

27:11.964 --> 27:14.264
They're always looking
for new people.

27:14.266 --> 27:15.833
Y-You can't do that.

27:15.835 --> 27:17.401
No?

27:17.403 --> 27:19.803
No--this is what I've
been trying to tell you!

27:19.805 --> 27:22.306
You're not like this anymore!

27:22.308 --> 27:25.175
You're not cruel, vicious
people who would sell

27:25.177 --> 27:29.079
someone into slavery just
because they're inconvenient.

27:29.081 --> 27:31.649
It's not just because
you're inconvenient.

27:32.752 --> 27:34.284
It's also for the money.

27:34.286 --> 27:35.119
[chuckles]

27:39.692 --> 27:44.328
Please... This isn't you...

27:46.866 --> 27:48.365
Get her out of here.

27:50.936 --> 27:52.336
No...

27:53.105 --> 27:54.705
--Please...
--Come on.

28:13.292 --> 28:14.892
[gasps]

28:16.262 --> 28:20.130
[RYO] Are you getting closer
to obtaining full control?

28:21.000 --> 28:24.968
Not yet, but I can feel it.

28:24.970 --> 28:27.204
I'm getting stronger.

28:27.206 --> 28:28.972
It's like all
the power in this ship

28:28.974 --> 28:31.041
is pulsing through me.

28:32.912 --> 28:35.379
I feel almost invincible.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.147
We should shut down the link.

28:39.251 --> 28:40.818
Why the hell would we do that?

28:40.820 --> 28:42.086
We don't need it.

28:42.088 --> 28:43.921
A crew of three
cannot maintain a ship

28:43.923 --> 28:45.756
of this size without an android.

28:45.758 --> 28:48.726
The girl said she'll be back
online in less than 30 hours.

28:48.728 --> 28:51.095
[PORTIA]
And you trust her?

28:51.097 --> 28:52.429
Even if that is true,
how do we know

28:52.431 --> 28:55.065
they haven't messed
with her programming?

28:55.067 --> 28:57.334
In case you haven't noticed,
we're playing catch-up.

28:57.336 --> 29:00.003
We need to run diagnostics,
check systems logs.

29:00.005 --> 29:03.006
The fastest, most efficient
way to do that is with a link.

29:03.008 --> 29:04.174
[RYO] Maybe, but you know
what could happen

29:04.176 --> 29:06.410
if you maintain it for too long.

29:07.513 --> 29:08.796
I can handle it.

29:08.797 --> 29:10.080
Yeah, well, I don't
think it's worth the risk--

29:10.082 --> 29:12.816
[PORTIA]
Are you trying to test me?

29:13.986 --> 29:18.455
Because I'll show you
what I can do.

29:18.457 --> 29:20.090
Soon enough.

29:21.327 --> 29:23.761
[FIVE] If she gets full
control, she'll be able

29:23.763 --> 29:26.063
to supersede all manual input.

29:26.065 --> 29:27.197
[ARAX] Then we have
to get to the bridge

29:27.199 --> 29:29.333
and cut the link
before that happens.

29:29.335 --> 29:31.435
How do you suppose
that we do that?

29:32.371 --> 29:35.973
[door hisses]

29:35.975 --> 29:37.107
[ARAX]
What took you so long?

29:37.109 --> 29:38.275
[NYX]
This is a big ship.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.077
I didn't know
where they put you.

29:40.079 --> 29:41.378
Where'd you get these?

29:41.380 --> 29:42.546
Three's quarters.

29:42.548 --> 29:44.214
Practically an armory.

29:44.216 --> 29:46.150
What--You can't kill them.

29:46.152 --> 29:47.851
[ARAX]
Well, I got news for you, Kid.

29:47.853 --> 29:49.887
Once they realize we're out,
they won't hesitate

29:49.889 --> 29:52.055
to kill us or you.

29:53.893 --> 29:55.359
[ARAX]
We take the bridge.

29:55.361 --> 29:56.860
Lock down the ship.

30:01.033 --> 30:03.033
Hey, you coming?

30:03.035 --> 30:05.002
I'm going to the infirmary.

30:05.004 --> 30:06.436
There might be another way.

30:06.438 --> 30:08.038
Okay.

30:15.281 --> 30:16.880
Son of a bitch.

30:18.818 --> 30:20.150
[MARCUS]
Guys, we got a problem.

30:20.152 --> 30:22.236
What is it?

30:22.237 --> 30:24.321
[MARCUS] Somebody broke into
my room, stole all my guns.

30:25.858 --> 30:27.491
[RYO] They'll head for the
bridge. We can cut them off.

30:27.493 --> 30:29.459
You go. I need to concentrate.

30:29.461 --> 30:31.895
--If they get to the bridge--
--[PORTIA] It won't matter.

30:31.897 --> 30:33.397
Not if I get control first.

30:35.334 --> 30:36.934
Go.

30:40.506 --> 30:42.105
[ANDROID SIMULATION]
She's not ready.

30:44.076 --> 30:47.845
She's at a very delicate
point in her repair cycle.

30:50.349 --> 30:51.949
[FIVE sighs]
Well, then, I guess I'll have to

30:51.951 --> 30:54.318
go with my backup plan.

30:54.320 --> 30:55.919
Plan to do what?

30:57.323 --> 30:59.423
The computer recognized
a neural imprint

30:59.425 --> 31:01.992
that Two uploaded
over a year ago.

31:01.994 --> 31:04.628
It used that imprint
to establish a link.

31:04.630 --> 31:05.896
Interesting.

31:05.898 --> 31:08.215
[FIVE]
It's more than interesting.

31:08.216 --> 31:10.533
I-It means the memories
aren't gone, not completely.

31:10.536 --> 31:13.136
They're just... inaccessible.

31:13.138 --> 31:16.273
Somehow, the link opened up
that side of her mind.

31:16.275 --> 31:18.008
It closed off the other.

31:18.010 --> 31:20.911
I'm still not seeing
any indication of a plan.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.548
I have her memories.

31:24.550 --> 31:27.651
Everything that made
Portia Lin what she was,

31:27.653 --> 31:31.154
and if I access them with this,

31:31.156 --> 31:33.590
the computer will
recognize a similar imprint.

31:33.592 --> 31:36.660
Thereby allowing you to
establish a link of your own.

31:36.662 --> 31:38.095
Exactly.

31:38.097 --> 31:39.930
[ANDROID SIMULATION]
That's not a good plan.

31:40.666 --> 31:42.433
Why not?

31:42.434 --> 31:44.201
A direct neural link between
a ship and a human mind

31:44.203 --> 31:46.536
is inherently dangerous.

31:46.538 --> 31:48.572
At first, it may induce
a state of euphoria,

31:48.574 --> 31:50.908
which can affect judgment.

31:50.910 --> 31:54.378
After that, there is a high
probability of brain damage.

31:55.547 --> 31:57.514
Then I better make it quick.

31:57.516 --> 32:00.317
I should also point out,
that device is not designed

32:00.319 --> 32:02.085
to be used in this manner.

32:03.656 --> 32:05.355
That's what she said.

32:17.569 --> 32:19.236
You see anything?

32:19.238 --> 32:20.637
What?

32:31.116 --> 32:32.282
There another way around?

32:32.284 --> 32:34.017
I don't think so.

32:34.019 --> 32:36.320
If we want to get to the bridge,
we have to go through them.

32:40.225 --> 32:41.458
I need to close the gap.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.026
Cover me.

32:43.028 --> 32:44.428
Whoa, wait!

32:49.234 --> 32:50.567
Is it just me, or is she crazy?

32:55.240 --> 32:56.707
Come.

32:56.709 --> 32:59.176
Yeah, she's crazy.

33:08.721 --> 33:10.420

Boone, what's your situation?

33:10.422 --> 33:12.656
We got them blocked
in for the moment.

33:14.994 --> 33:16.093
If we run out of
ammo before they do,

33:16.095 --> 33:17.661
we're in trouble.

33:26.038 --> 33:27.237
Don't worry.

33:27.239 --> 33:28.638
I've got it.

33:37.783 --> 33:39.516

Okay, that's it.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.284
They're not going anywhere.

33:41.286 --> 33:43.720
Nice.

33:43.721 --> 33:46.155
Someone's been accessing ship
systems from the infirmary.

Yeah, it must be the girl.

33:47.593 --> 33:49.192

Okay, no problem.

33:50.729 --> 33:52.796
Just get down there

Any luck?

I managed to link, but
I can't make sense of it.

[ANDROID SIMULATION]
Well, you need to try harder,

34:28.467 --> 34:30.300
because you're
running out of time.

34:30.302 --> 34:32.702
Why, what's happening?

34:32.704 --> 34:35.772
The computer has initiated
an encryption program.

34:35.774 --> 34:37.741
It's only a matter of minutes
before your lock code

34:37.743 --> 34:39.609
is compromised.

34:44.349 --> 34:46.249
All right, I got
the computer on it.

34:46.251 --> 34:48.452
In the meantime, I'm gonna
take care of the others.

You better hope not.
That's an air lock.

She's trying to open
the outer doors.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.550

They're locked down

35:03.551 --> 35:05.301
as long as the inner
doors are open.

35:05.304 --> 35:06.837
It's a failsafe.

35:06.839 --> 35:09.239
Unless she can override it.

35:15.747 --> 35:17.114
Shit!

35:17.116 --> 35:18.882
What's wrong?

35:18.884 --> 35:22.552
I can see the information,
but I-I-I can't manipulate it.

She's blocking me.
She's... she's too strong.

35:27.126 --> 35:28.525
I can't do it.

Use her memories.

What are you talking about?

at her most vulnerable,

Yeah, I'm not sure
she has moments like that.

35:45.177 --> 35:48.912
Everyone has moments like
that, but you need to hurry.

35:48.914 --> 35:50.780
If she links with
the computer for too long,

35:50.782 --> 35:53.183
she will lose
herself completely.

if our memories
were wiped,

then how did the link

40:29.694 --> 40:33.496
I'm glad, but that's
not why I'm here.

40:38.570 --> 40:40.603
What's this?

40:40.605 --> 40:43.006
It's one of the boxes
we found in the vault.

40:43.008 --> 40:45.508
None of us knew how to
open it, but your old self

40:45.510 --> 40:47.677
knew the combination.

40:47.679 --> 40:50.013
Yeah?

40:50.015 --> 40:51.614
Hmm.

40:58.623 --> 41:01.724
[FIVE] It's got some personal
items I thought you might want.

41:05.163 --> 41:06.229
[THREE]
Hmm.

41:12.471 --> 41:15.138
[THREE mimics rocket]

41:29.087 --> 41:31.120
That belonged to Sara.

41:38.129 --> 41:39.729
Anyway...

41:41.967 --> 41:43.566
Hey.

41:48.006 --> 41:49.606
Thank you.

41:51.910 --> 41:53.510
You're welcome.

42:31.082 --> 42:32.815
You're not gonna believe this.

42:32.817 --> 42:35.552
We just got a signal from one
of the subspace transponders.

42:35.554 --> 42:36.853
Who?

42:36.855 --> 42:38.154
Marcus Boone.
