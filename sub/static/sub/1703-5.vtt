00:06.377 --> 00:09.541
PRESIDENT REAGAN: <i>Air and naval forces</i>
<i>of the United States</i>

00:09.575 --> 00:12.373
<i>launched a series of strikes</i>
<i>against terrorist facilities...</i>

00:12.407 --> 00:14.505
REPORTER: <i>Pan Am Flight 103 crashed</i>
<i>into the the town of Lockerbie.</i>

00:14.540 --> 00:15.872
REAGAN:
<i>...savage acts of terror in</i>

00:15.906 --> 00:18.509
<i>Africa, Europe,</i>
<i>the Middle East.</i>

00:18.543 --> 00:21.348
GEORGE H.W. BUSH: <i>This will not stand, this</i>
<i>aggression against, uh, Kuwait.</i>

00:21.383 --> 00:22.915
<i>REAGAN:</i>
<i>This relentless pursuit of terror.</i>

00:22.949 --> 00:24.682
<i>We will make no distinction.</i>

00:24.717 --> 00:26.014
REPORTER:
<i>The USS</i> Cole <i>was attacked</i>

00:26.049 --> 00:27.215
<i>while refueling in</i>
<i>the port of Aden.</i>

00:27.249 --> 00:29.182
This was an act of terrorism.

00:29.216 --> 00:31.682
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

00:31.717 --> 00:34.150
<i>The next song</i>
<i>we're going to play for you</i>

00:34.184 --> 00:35.353
is one of the good old
favorites.

00:35.387 --> 00:37.823
Until something shocks him...

00:37.857 --> 00:40.662
WOMAN: <i>I'm just making sure</i>
<i>we don't get hit again.</i>

00:40.696 --> 00:44.229
MAN: <i>That plane crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center.</i>

00:45.564 --> 00:47.864
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

00:47.898 --> 00:51.569
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

00:51.603 --> 00:53.872
(speaking Arabic)

00:58.212 --> 00:59.793
SAUL:
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

01:00.267 --> 01:01.319
God!

01:01.559 --> 01:03.440
CARRIE: <i>Fuck! I missed</i>
<i>something once before.</i>

01:03.474 --> 01:06.209
<i>I won't...</i>
<i>I</i> can't <i>let that happen again.</i>

01:08.520 --> 01:10.019
SAUL:
<i>It was ten years ago.</i>

01:10.139 --> 01:11.347
<i>Everyone missed something</i>
<i>that day.</i>

01:11.381 --> 01:13.348
CARRIE:
<i>Everyone's not me.</i>

01:23.893 --> 01:25.873
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland:

01:25.993 --> 01:27.626
I got a mood disorder, okay?

01:27.660 --> 01:29.094
I looked it up, Carrie.

01:29.128 --> 01:30.095
Clozapine's an antipsychotic.

01:30.129 --> 01:31.930
Only seven this time?

01:31.964 --> 01:34.366
Raiding my samples cupboard
not only enables you,

01:34.400 --> 01:36.803
it jeopardizes my license.

01:36.837 --> 01:38.938
So... seven pills.

01:38.972 --> 01:39.872
The terrorists are
still out there.

01:39.907 --> 01:41.941
<i>We need Brody in the public eye</i>

01:41.976 --> 01:44.478
<i>reminding America</i>
<i>that this is far from over.</i>

01:44.512 --> 01:46.447
And smile for the cameras.

01:46.481 --> 01:50.551
Look at him. He's been blogged
and tweeted about

01:50.585 --> 01:53.421
and solicited by every
national talk show.

01:53.455 --> 01:55.756
During the debrief, Carrie
mentions Abu Nazir's name

01:55.790 --> 01:57.124
out of the blue.

01:57.158 --> 01:59.159
Three days later,
one of her assets reports

01:59.193 --> 02:01.094
the first Nazir sighting in over
seven years.

02:01.128 --> 02:03.329
Maybe it's coincidence.
Or maybe there's something

02:03.363 --> 02:04.630
she's just not telling us.

02:04.664 --> 02:05.931
This intelligence

02:05.965 --> 02:07.665
your asset gave up
her life to acquire,

02:07.700 --> 02:09.500
do not squander it
by continuing to invade

02:09.535 --> 02:12.136
the constitutionally protected
privacy of the Brody family.

02:12.171 --> 02:14.772
You need to take down
that surveillance.

02:16.008 --> 02:18.243
We're on to the next case.

02:18.278 --> 02:19.645
Raqim Faisel.

02:19.679 --> 02:22.682
FAISEL:
<i>He followed me to this house.</i>

02:22.716 --> 02:25.484
AILEEN: <i>Darling, I promise no one</i>
<i>knows we're living here.</i>

02:25.519 --> 02:26.986
I still think we should leave.

02:27.020 --> 02:28.920
Our instructions were
to sit tight.

02:28.955 --> 02:31.022
You knew this would not be easy.

02:31.057 --> 02:33.324
I can't help but feel
I'm missing something.

02:33.359 --> 02:34.493
You're missing him.

02:41.299 --> 02:44.001
Oh, I'm sorry!
Hey, I know you.

02:44.035 --> 02:46.970
I'm not supposed to be here.

02:47.004 --> 02:49.372
Hey, look, I'm not going back
in if it means

02:49.406 --> 02:51.941
you can't go back in.
That's not necessary.

02:51.975 --> 02:53.877
Maybe we can hold our own
private meeting out here.

02:53.911 --> 02:56.746
How's that sound?
It's tempting.

Christ, you call
yourself a ball player?

04:36.180 --> 04:37.281

04:37.315 --> 04:40.250
Geez, you freak.

COMMENTATOR:
A double and a single in the fourth.

04:42.654 --> 04:44.289
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're wrong.

04:44.323 --> 04:48.293
Why don't you just man up
and admit it, asshole!

04:48.327 --> 04:50.495
That's right, you jerkoff,
I'm talking about you!

04:50.529 --> 04:52.730
You're a goddamn disgrace!

04:52.765 --> 04:54.598
Unfucking believable!

04:54.633 --> 04:56.066
The only team in baseball has

04:56.101 --> 04:59.336
to pinch run their leadoff man.

05:01.005 --> 05:02.506
How long you been
standing there?

05:02.540 --> 05:04.408
What? I can't hear you.

05:04.442 --> 05:07.278
Oh, well, yeah. Oh, yeah.

05:08.280 --> 05:11.149
There. Hey.

05:11.183 --> 05:13.151
Hey. I rang the bell,
like five times, Dad.

05:13.185 --> 05:15.287
Hey, is Maggie home?

05:15.321 --> 05:16.989
No, she had to go deal

05:17.023 --> 05:18.958
with some patient crisis
at the hospital

05:18.992 --> 05:20.726
Hey, you hungry, huh?

05:20.761 --> 05:22.729
She say how long she'd be?

05:22.763 --> 05:25.532
I can make you a sandwich.
You want a sandwich?

05:25.567 --> 05:28.703
I got, we got turkey,
lettuce...

05:28.737 --> 05:30.137
(phone rings)

05:30.172 --> 05:31.739
Shit, I gotta get this.

05:31.773 --> 05:33.674
Uh, yeah, turkey's great.

05:35.343 --> 05:36.977
Uh, hold on a second.

05:39.414 --> 05:40.514
Hello.

05:40.548 --> 05:44.150
Hey, Danny.

05:44.184 --> 05:45.685
What?

05:45.719 --> 05:48.087
The one surviving terrorist
from the compound in Afghanistan

05:48.121 --> 05:49.522
where we rescued Brody.

05:49.556 --> 05:52.359
Scooped him up in some
shitshack in IBD.

05:52.393 --> 05:55.195
Clean lift. Nothing broken,
nothing spilt.

05:55.229 --> 05:58.265
Okay, I'll be there
in 30 minutes.

05:58.300 --> 06:01.703
(sighs)

06:18.087 --> 06:20.388
Oh! Sweetie!

06:20.422 --> 06:22.590
(chuckles)

06:25.961 --> 06:27.461
Welcome.

06:27.495 --> 06:30.130
Hi. You okay?

06:30.165 --> 06:32.032
No, happy to see you is all.

06:32.067 --> 06:33.300
Yeah?

06:33.335 --> 06:34.802
Over here.

07:06.268 --> 07:07.835
(Frank sighs and
clears his throat)

07:07.869 --> 07:09.436
Educated guess says you, uh...

07:09.471 --> 07:10.971
you need this to go.

07:11.006 --> 07:12.606
Sorry, Dad.

07:12.641 --> 07:14.575
(steam hissing)

07:14.610 --> 07:17.011
(sighs)

07:17.046 --> 07:20.983
Oh. Oh, you must think I'm ready
for the glue factory, Carrie.

07:21.017 --> 07:22.685
Unplugging the iron like that.

07:22.719 --> 07:25.288
Come on.
I'm just trying to be safe.

07:28.726 --> 07:31.327
Did you take your meds
this morning, Dad?

07:31.362 --> 07:33.696
I did. Thank you for asking.

07:33.730 --> 07:36.332
Bad enough I've got your sister
up my ass 24/7.

07:36.366 --> 07:37.966
Now you, too?

07:38.000 --> 07:41.269
And just so you know,
those pills are killing me.

07:41.304 --> 07:43.338
No they're not, Dad.
Sometimes you just feel like

07:43.372 --> 07:44.972
you're spinning out
of control a little

07:45.007 --> 07:46.807
when they bring you
up instead of down.

07:46.842 --> 07:48.642
That happens to you, too?

07:48.676 --> 07:50.510
It's a good time

07:50.544 --> 07:53.480
to avoid household appliances
in my experience.

07:53.514 --> 07:57.150
I was distracted,
I was excited to see you is all.

07:57.185 --> 07:58.985
(sighs)

07:59.020 --> 08:01.487
Okay, message received
and understood.

08:03.256 --> 08:06.158
I wish I could stay and help you
out with the chores.

08:06.192 --> 08:07.559
Yeah, right.

08:07.593 --> 08:09.227
Well, you enjoy.

08:09.262 --> 08:10.963
Drive safe.

08:10.997 --> 08:12.365
And...

08:12.399 --> 08:14.333
Fuck the C.I.A.
Fuck the C.I.A.

08:14.368 --> 08:16.569
SAUL:
So, how are your parents?

08:16.604 --> 08:18.972
MIRA: Wonderful. They seem to
get busier and busier.

08:19.006 --> 08:20.974
We need to get them
over here more.

08:21.009 --> 08:22.744
Too much work in
Mumbai for that.

08:22.778 --> 08:24.712
That's what they would say.

08:24.747 --> 08:26.915
Maybe they ought to think

08:26.949 --> 08:30.019
about handing the slums project
off to somebody else now.

08:31.554 --> 08:33.020
What have you lost?

08:33.056 --> 08:34.657
Ticket for the parking.

08:34.691 --> 08:37.527
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Will standby passengers...

08:37.561 --> 08:40.029
It'll be in the car,
where you always leave it.

08:40.063 --> 08:41.496
(phone ringing)

08:41.532 --> 08:44.232
Oh. That didn't take long.

08:44.267 --> 08:46.235
I love you so.
I tell you that already?

08:46.270 --> 08:48.271
Go on, answer it.
I know you have to.

08:48.305 --> 08:50.039
Hello? Saul Berenson.

08:50.073 --> 08:52.274
He wants everyone here ASAP.
No, no, no, on the secure link.

08:52.309 --> 08:53.909
Get me Captain Mike Faber
at the Pentagon.

08:53.944 --> 08:55.611
GALVEZ: Has been alerted
and is in-bound.

08:55.645 --> 08:57.346
I'm gonna get a cab.

08:57.380 --> 08:59.114
Oh, and Estes wants everyone
to clear their schedules...

08:59.149 --> 09:00.849
Mira, wait. Wait,
wait, wait, wait.

09:00.883 --> 09:02.751
Um... no.

09:02.785 --> 09:05.519
I-I know what that look
means, Saul, and I'm not.

09:05.554 --> 09:07.121
I'm not angry, I'm really not.

09:07.155 --> 09:10.090
And I hope I see you later.

09:10.125 --> 09:11.525
Saul?

09:11.559 --> 09:12.926
Yeah, yeah, I'm still here.

09:12.961 --> 09:14.294
All right,
before the briefing starts,

09:14.328 --> 09:15.896
there's a report
you need to read

09:15.930 --> 09:17.197
from the Pakistan phase
of the interrogation.

09:17.231 --> 09:18.932
I'll be right over.

09:20.134 --> 09:22.536
Afzal Hamid.

09:22.570 --> 09:24.872
34 years old, Syrian.

09:24.906 --> 09:27.775
According to our friends
in Pakistani Intelligence,

09:27.809 --> 09:29.209
a mid-level member

09:29.244 --> 09:30.578
of the Islamic People's
Liberation Army.

09:30.612 --> 09:32.446
Abu Nazir's group.

09:32.481 --> 09:34.415
Which means he most likely has
knowledge of Nazir's plans

09:34.449 --> 09:37.051
to attack us here
in Fortress America.

09:37.085 --> 09:40.088
Including money trail from the
Hawala shop-- where it went,

09:40.122 --> 09:42.157
what it's being used for.
ESTES: Which is exactly why

09:42.191 --> 09:44.293
you and Carrie
will interrogate him.

09:44.327 --> 09:46.161
With the help of Sergeant Brody.

09:48.665 --> 09:50.766
Excuse me. Sergeant Brody?

09:50.800 --> 09:53.468
Yes, Carrie, Sergeant Brody,
who is in a unique position

09:53.502 --> 09:55.970
to establish a baseline
on Hamid. Right or wrong?

09:56.004 --> 09:57.305
Right.

09:57.339 --> 09:59.906
Now, the interview
itself will take place

09:59.941 --> 10:02.008
at a designated safe house,
yet to be determined.

10:02.043 --> 10:03.443
Brody absolutely
can't be there.

10:03.477 --> 10:05.511
He will be there, Carrie.
That ship has sailed.

10:05.546 --> 10:07.646
Then we might as well
just hand our playbook

10:07.681 --> 10:09.115
straight to Abu Nazir.

10:09.149 --> 10:10.917
Well, the alternative
might be worse.

10:10.951 --> 10:12.986
Nothing is worse than Brody
witnessing this interrogation.

10:13.020 --> 10:14.688
The blowback will be profound.

10:14.722 --> 10:16.757
Assuming we do what
you want then-- that is,

10:16.791 --> 10:18.325
share your suspicions
about Sergeant Brody--

10:18.359 --> 10:19.860
what do you think
will happen then?

10:19.894 --> 10:21.829
Well, it might force David
into a decision.

10:21.863 --> 10:23.330
A decision based on what?

10:23.365 --> 10:25.867
How many times must we
have this discussion?

10:25.901 --> 10:27.969
There's no evidence linking
Brody to Abu Nazir.

10:28.003 --> 10:29.838
This is a different
discussion, Saul.

10:29.872 --> 10:31.807
This is about
operational security.

10:31.841 --> 10:34.176
(sighs)
Okay, Carrie.

10:35.745 --> 10:37.546
March up to his
office right now.

10:37.580 --> 10:39.180
Tell him he's been duped.

10:39.215 --> 10:41.382
Tell him Sergeant Brody's
location in Afghanistan

10:41.416 --> 10:43.184
was intentionally leaked
by Nazir.

10:43.218 --> 10:44.651
Tell him the story

10:44.686 --> 10:46.520
of his American hero
has a surprise twist.

10:46.554 --> 10:48.021
See what he does then.

10:48.055 --> 10:50.190
My guess-- you're
packing your cubicle,

10:50.224 --> 10:52.158
looking for a job in
the private sector.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.995
Don't we have a moral obligation
to say something?

10:55.029 --> 10:58.065
Our obligation is to stop
the next attack on America.

10:58.100 --> 11:01.002
Which you won't be a part of
if you keep pursuing this.

11:02.204 --> 11:04.172
Has it occurred to you
at the very least

11:04.207 --> 11:06.842
we'll be able to observe Brody
at close quarters

11:06.876 --> 11:09.712
in a high stress environment
which we can control.

11:09.746 --> 11:12.014
Yeah, it's occurred to me, Saul.

11:12.048 --> 11:13.716
Has it occurred to you

11:13.750 --> 11:15.350
if we do our jobs
and break Afzal Hamid,

11:15.385 --> 11:16.819
he just might give up
the whole plot,

11:16.853 --> 11:18.486
including Sergeant Brody?

11:18.521 --> 11:20.155
Well, that's a big if, Saul.

11:20.189 --> 11:22.490
You're screwing up my rug.

11:22.525 --> 11:26.894
Either David Estes makes the
weather, Carrie, or we do.

11:26.928 --> 11:28.796
Your choice.

11:37.072 --> 11:39.440
(rhythmic breathing)

11:52.956 --> 11:55.190
This can't be good.

11:55.224 --> 11:57.258
Jess said I'd find you here.

11:57.292 --> 11:58.993
It's urgent.

12:03.398 --> 12:05.032
Langley needs to see you.

12:06.235 --> 12:08.402
Langley?

12:08.437 --> 12:09.937
So you better haul ass.

12:09.971 --> 12:12.372
Shit, shower, shave, be ready
sometime in the next 40 minutes

12:12.406 --> 12:13.941
when they come to get you.

12:15.143 --> 12:16.977
What do they want?

12:17.011 --> 12:19.880
Didn't say.
Eyes only classified.

12:19.914 --> 12:22.449
You couldn't have
just called me?

12:22.483 --> 12:24.217
They told me not to.

12:24.252 --> 12:25.819
No open line phone calls.

12:25.853 --> 12:28.855
Jesus.
Yeah, no shit.

12:30.590 --> 12:32.291
You went by my house already?

12:32.326 --> 12:34.560
Figured I'd stay out
of Jessica's hair.

12:34.594 --> 12:35.661
You figured right.

12:39.599 --> 12:41.667
Is that it?

12:41.701 --> 12:44.070
Can't tell me anything else?

12:44.104 --> 12:46.105
That's all I know
right now, Brody.

12:46.139 --> 12:48.040
If I knew anything else,
I'd tell you.

12:50.711 --> 12:52.845
Yeah.

12:56.316 --> 12:59.152
What did Mike want?

13:01.689 --> 13:04.857
The CIA wanted to see me.

13:04.892 --> 13:06.326
About what?

13:07.561 --> 13:09.195
I don't know.

13:13.201 --> 13:14.801
(sighs, pants)

13:14.836 --> 13:16.570
Going to take a shower.

13:17.905 --> 13:19.205
They'll be here any second now.

13:19.240 --> 13:21.675
Hey. Are you okay?

13:21.709 --> 13:23.443
You know what, Jess?
Can you just stop

13:23.477 --> 13:26.112
asking me that
every two minutes? I'm fine.

13:26.147 --> 13:28.615
Okay. Okay.

13:28.649 --> 13:30.650
I'm sorry.

13:30.684 --> 13:32.151
I didn't mean to...

13:32.185 --> 13:34.120
No, you're right. I get it.
(door opens)

13:34.154 --> 13:35.688
CHRIS:
Hey, Dad.

13:35.722 --> 13:37.656
Mom said you wanted to come
watch my karate tomorrow.

13:37.690 --> 13:40.024
She did?
He's getting his blue belt.

13:40.059 --> 13:41.793
If I pass the test.

13:41.827 --> 13:43.294
So can you come?

13:43.329 --> 13:46.030
Sure. Wouldn't miss it
for the world.

14:04.452 --> 14:06.086
(shackles clinking)

14:29.145 --> 14:31.146
(engine starts)

14:33.382 --> 14:36.185
North. So not Langley.

14:38.488 --> 14:40.423
No blindfold or anything?

14:40.457 --> 14:42.425
We trust you.

14:42.459 --> 14:44.427
Sir, we're five minutes out.

14:44.462 --> 14:46.329
Copy that.

15:15.625 --> 15:17.626
♪ ♪

15:29.307 --> 15:31.275
Estes, we're up. We're online.

15:37.715 --> 15:39.516
Sergeant Brody,

15:39.550 --> 15:41.184
Carrie Mathison.

15:41.219 --> 15:44.387
We met at the debrief
a few weeks ago.

15:48.392 --> 15:50.993
Yes. Uh, good...
good to see you.

15:51.028 --> 15:52.395
Thanks so much for coming.

15:53.964 --> 15:56.567
How are you settling
back in with your family?

15:59.137 --> 16:00.604
Yeah.

16:00.638 --> 16:04.008
Um, can we get you
anything-- a coffee,

16:04.042 --> 16:06.177
or soda or water--
before we get started?

16:06.212 --> 16:08.213
Get started with what?

16:09.916 --> 16:12.017
Have a seat.

16:30.902 --> 16:32.502
Do you know this man?

16:38.676 --> 16:41.378
Motherfucking shit.

16:47.618 --> 16:50.019
(zipping)

17:03.637 --> 17:05.872
Yeah, I know him.

17:07.141 --> 17:09.541
He was my guard.

17:09.577 --> 17:11.777
Visual recognition confirmed.

17:11.811 --> 17:13.613
Do you remember his name?

17:14.781 --> 17:16.781
They called him Affie.

17:16.816 --> 17:19.584
CARRIE: His full
name is Afzal Hamid.

17:19.618 --> 17:21.286
He was the sole survivor
of the attack

17:21.319 --> 17:22.753
on the safe house
where you were rescued.

17:24.990 --> 17:26.624
(urinating)

17:26.657 --> 17:28.058
(urinating stops)

17:28.092 --> 17:29.760
(zipping)

17:51.318 --> 17:53.052
Who's he?

17:53.087 --> 17:54.353
My colleague.

18:07.934 --> 18:09.902
<i>As-Salamu alaykum.</i>

18:15.608 --> 18:18.276
<i>As-Salamu alaykum.</i>

18:19.779 --> 18:22.614
(speaking Arabic)

18:47.637 --> 18:49.104
What's he doing?

18:49.138 --> 18:50.505
He's waiting to see

18:50.540 --> 18:52.040
if Hamid will say
something first.

18:52.075 --> 18:54.677
This is the first stages
of an interrogation.

18:54.712 --> 18:56.179
Not exactly.

18:56.214 --> 18:57.814
Pakistani Intelligence
held him for three days

18:57.848 --> 18:59.049
before they turned him over.

18:59.083 --> 19:01.051
Did he talk?

19:01.086 --> 19:03.454
I'm afraid
I can't tell you that.

19:03.489 --> 19:05.023
In fact, I can't share
any operational details

19:05.057 --> 19:07.025
with you at all.
Then why am I here?

19:07.059 --> 19:08.527
CARRIE:
Two reasons: one, to confirm

19:08.561 --> 19:10.896
his identity, which
you've just done,

19:10.930 --> 19:13.131
and two, to provide
us with information

19:13.166 --> 19:14.466
we can use to unsettle him.

19:14.500 --> 19:16.468
To prove we have
complete control.

19:16.502 --> 19:18.636
To demonstrate our omnipotence.

19:18.671 --> 19:20.638
Are you comfortable with that?

19:20.673 --> 19:22.140
Yeah, I think so.

19:22.174 --> 19:23.841
Okay, good.

19:24.943 --> 19:26.477
Are you ready to begin?

19:26.512 --> 19:28.045
One question.

19:28.080 --> 19:29.380
Go ahead.

19:30.449 --> 19:32.083
Will he be tortured?

19:33.252 --> 19:35.419
We don't do that here.

19:35.454 --> 19:38.255
What is it you think
he knows about?

19:38.290 --> 19:39.991
Like I said, I can't...

19:40.025 --> 19:42.026
Divulge operational details.
Got it.

19:42.061 --> 19:43.862
Mm-hmm.

19:43.896 --> 19:45.931
Okay, I'm ready.

19:48.201 --> 19:50.203
You can put this
on now, please.

19:52.607 --> 19:54.841
Tap the mic twice so my
colleague knows we're ready.

20:00.782 --> 20:03.183
Do you speak English?

20:03.218 --> 20:05.352
Please.

20:05.386 --> 20:06.620
Does he?

20:06.654 --> 20:08.021
Did he ever speak
English to you?

20:09.557 --> 20:11.525
They all spoke some English.

20:11.559 --> 20:14.194
This is for my friends
in Guantanamo.

20:14.228 --> 20:16.530
(screaming)

20:16.565 --> 20:18.399
SAUL:
We know you speak English.

20:19.468 --> 20:20.969
Therefore, I will continue

20:21.003 --> 20:23.405
to address you in English.

20:23.439 --> 20:25.407
Are you a religious man?

20:33.350 --> 20:34.983
Okay, this part needs to move

20:35.018 --> 20:36.785
a little faster.
Are you good with that?

20:36.819 --> 20:39.554
They all prayed.
They're extremely devout.

20:39.588 --> 20:42.657
Of course you are.

20:44.426 --> 20:46.094
SAUL:
This soldier

20:46.128 --> 20:48.062
was your prisoner.

20:50.598 --> 20:52.466
When did you first meet him?

20:52.500 --> 20:53.800
Damascus.

20:53.835 --> 20:55.235
We know you didn't meet him

20:55.269 --> 20:56.737
until Damascus--
that's when

20:56.771 --> 20:58.205
the interrogations began,
didn't they?

20:59.941 --> 21:01.942
And you were part
of those interrogations,

21:01.977 --> 21:03.310
weren't you?

21:03.345 --> 21:04.611
Yeah, he was.

21:04.645 --> 21:06.246
For how long

21:06.280 --> 21:07.881
was Sergeant Brody interrogated?

21:09.483 --> 21:10.851
Days?

21:12.220 --> 21:13.620
Months?

21:13.655 --> 21:14.755
Years.

21:14.789 --> 21:16.656
It went on for years,

21:16.691 --> 21:17.891
didn't it?

21:20.194 --> 21:23.063
What did you do
to Sergeant Brody, Afzal?

21:25.967 --> 21:27.968
If you have a detail
we could use.

21:29.504 --> 21:31.504
He beat me with a stick
wrapped in barbed wire,

21:31.539 --> 21:32.805
and he pissed on me.

21:32.840 --> 21:35.274
You beat him

21:35.309 --> 21:37.143
with barbed wire

21:37.177 --> 21:40.145
and urinated on him.

21:42.315 --> 21:45.151
So you're a religious man
and a torturer.

21:45.185 --> 21:47.587
What are you, Catholic?

21:53.060 --> 21:55.628
You think your wife and sons
are still alive?

21:57.531 --> 21:58.898
There, you see that?

21:58.932 --> 22:00.533
That's exactly what
we were going for?

22:00.567 --> 22:02.134
He was convinced
we already know

22:02.168 --> 22:04.036
the answers to our questions.
Now he thinks

22:04.070 --> 22:07.338
we know if his family is alive--
information <i>he</i> wants.

22:07.373 --> 22:09.040
SAUL:
Let's back up, shall we?

22:09.074 --> 22:12.977
Five days ago, you're safely
hidden away in Islamabad.

22:13.011 --> 22:14.980
Or so you think.

22:15.014 --> 22:18.316
I mean, why else have
your family with you.

22:18.351 --> 22:20.519
Then suddenly
in the dead of night,

22:20.553 --> 22:22.320
you disappear without a trace.

22:22.355 --> 22:24.489
It's not just your
poor wife and children

22:24.523 --> 22:26.358
who are wondering
where you are.

22:26.392 --> 22:29.028
One man in particular

22:29.062 --> 22:30.463
is beginning to worry.

22:32.099 --> 22:34.067
Abu Nazir.

22:35.402 --> 22:37.771
Who, as we all know,
is not your average

22:37.805 --> 22:40.073
Islamist terrorist
bent on bringing down

22:40.108 --> 22:41.509
Western civilization.

22:41.543 --> 22:43.578
No, this man has
a certain style,

22:43.612 --> 22:45.013
a certain...

22:46.248 --> 22:48.383
...artistry.

22:48.417 --> 22:52.887
Let's take the case of
Yasser Akram, for example.

22:52.922 --> 22:55.756
Lifted by our British friends
from a villa in Lebanon

22:55.790 --> 22:58.559
in August 2006.

22:58.593 --> 23:01.895
Within days of his capture,
his only brother...

23:01.929 --> 23:04.063
a good and holy man,

23:04.098 --> 23:06.132
is killed in a car bomb.

23:06.166 --> 23:09.268
The Yemeni police had
to ship what was left of him

23:09.302 --> 23:11.938
in a small plastic bag
to a lab in Dubai

23:11.972 --> 23:13.272
just to identify him.

23:13.307 --> 23:17.277
Not to mention
what was done to...

23:17.311 --> 23:19.780
his poor parents...

23:19.814 --> 23:21.882
to his wives...

23:21.917 --> 23:24.185
and most disturbingly,
to his children.

23:27.289 --> 23:29.457
We can protect
your family, Afzal--

23:29.492 --> 23:31.259
up to eight individuals.

23:31.293 --> 23:34.463
But we don't have much time--
Abu Nazir is not a patient man.

23:34.497 --> 23:37.332
You can come in now, Joelle.

23:37.367 --> 23:39.568
(door opens)

23:48.478 --> 23:49.945
When you're ready to talk to us,

23:49.979 --> 23:53.181
write down their names
and addresses.

23:56.518 --> 23:59.854
If you love your kids,
like I love mine...

23:59.888 --> 24:02.956
I would hurry.

24:05.627 --> 24:07.294
(door opens)

24:07.328 --> 24:08.929
(door closes)

24:12.867 --> 24:14.467
(Carrie sighs)

24:20.841 --> 24:22.442
Now what?

24:22.476 --> 24:25.845
Now we wait for him
to pick up that crayon.

24:25.880 --> 24:29.182
When the interrogator said
that he could protect his...

24:29.217 --> 24:32.786
We already have his wife and
children out of harm's way.

24:32.821 --> 24:35.656
You can go home now;
thank you for your help.

24:35.691 --> 24:37.191
We've got it from here.

24:37.226 --> 24:39.060
Hey, guys?
Hey, would you just

24:39.095 --> 24:41.463
let me in the room with him,
just for a couple of minutes?

24:41.497 --> 24:43.532
I just want to look
the prick in the eye,

24:43.566 --> 24:45.501
let him know that
the tables are turned.

24:45.535 --> 24:47.203
You know I can't do that.

24:47.237 --> 24:49.305
I wish I could, but I can't.

24:49.340 --> 24:52.476
You do see that, don't you?
Sure.

24:52.510 --> 24:54.244
Look, go home,
forget about today,

24:54.278 --> 24:56.646
forget about all this--
and, of course,

24:56.681 --> 24:58.181
it goes without saying...

24:58.215 --> 25:00.050
Don't tell anybody.

25:00.084 --> 25:03.353
Hey, but if you do find yourself
needing to talk to someone,

25:03.387 --> 25:04.588
um...

25:06.124 --> 25:07.358
Anytime,

25:07.392 --> 25:09.993
24/7.

25:10.027 --> 25:13.297
Good-bye, Sergeant Brody;
you've been a big help today.

25:19.237 --> 25:20.705
ESTES:
Hey, Carrie?

25:22.240 --> 25:23.340
Hey.

25:23.375 --> 25:25.376
Excellent work,
both you and Saul.

25:25.410 --> 25:26.677
Doesn't get
any better than that.

25:26.711 --> 25:27.878
Let me know Thank you, David.

25:27.913 --> 25:29.280
the minute Hamid makes a move,

25:29.314 --> 25:30.381
one way or the other.

25:30.415 --> 25:32.883
I will.

25:34.152 --> 25:35.753
Well?

25:35.787 --> 25:37.922
When you turned over
that picture of Abu Nazir,

25:37.956 --> 25:38.923
he stopped breathing

25:38.957 --> 25:40.725
for a few seconds.

25:40.759 --> 25:43.294
I know he's hiding something from us,
I know it.

25:43.328 --> 25:45.229
Shit!

25:45.263 --> 25:46.363
What?
Well, now's the time

25:46.398 --> 25:47.698
we really could use that

25:47.732 --> 25:48.932
surveillance on his house.

25:48.967 --> 25:50.767
Don't go there, Carrie.

25:50.802 --> 25:52.803
Be patient.

25:54.640 --> 25:57.075
All right, I'll take the doom watch.
You go be with Mira.

25:57.109 --> 25:59.277
I'll call you if
anything happens tonight.

25:59.311 --> 26:01.713
Pace yourself.

26:09.190 --> 26:13.093
Come on, asshole,
pick up the damn crayon.

26:18.299 --> 26:20.232
JESSICA:
Brody.

26:20.267 --> 26:22.301
Sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you.

26:22.336 --> 26:23.736
Hey, where you been?

26:25.004 --> 26:26.638
You cut your hair.

26:26.672 --> 26:29.240
(laughs)
What do you think?

26:29.274 --> 26:32.243
Nice.

26:32.277 --> 26:34.779
You always liked it short.

26:34.813 --> 26:37.549
No, I like it. Really.

26:39.852 --> 26:42.954
You did something for me by
going to that support group,

26:42.989 --> 26:45.190
so I thought I'd do
something for you.

26:46.693 --> 26:48.627
Tea?

26:49.662 --> 26:51.430
Thanks.

26:51.464 --> 26:53.932
(groans)

26:53.967 --> 26:55.701
What are you doing out here?

26:55.735 --> 26:57.769
Nothing. Just
enjoying the quiet.

26:57.804 --> 26:59.371
Rough day?

27:00.973 --> 27:03.775
What was it about, anyway?

27:03.810 --> 27:06.612
I'm not really supposed
to talk about it, Jess.

27:06.646 --> 27:08.947
Not even a little?
I can't.

27:08.982 --> 27:10.549
I'm sorry.

27:23.529 --> 27:26.131
How's your tea?
Good.

27:26.165 --> 27:28.466
Yorkshire Gold.
Your favorite.

27:28.500 --> 27:30.068
It's perfect.

27:30.102 --> 27:32.037
(clears throat)
Thanks.

27:47.885 --> 27:50.853
(loud heavy metal playing)

27:53.023 --> 27:55.058
(heavy metal stops)

27:55.092 --> 27:56.393
(exhales quietly)

27:57.428 --> 28:00.230
(loud heavy metal playing)

28:02.434 --> 28:04.768
(loud heavy metal continues)

28:06.572 --> 28:08.673
(heavy metal stops)

28:11.878 --> 28:15.046
(loud heavy metal playing)

28:16.549 --> 28:18.750
(heavy metal stops)

28:21.321 --> 28:24.122
(loud heavy metal playing)

28:26.391 --> 28:28.125
(heavy metal stops)

28:29.494 --> 28:32.128
(loud heavy metal playing)

28:33.297 --> 28:35.331
(heavy metal stops)

28:39.637 --> 28:42.439
(filling cup)

28:42.473 --> 28:45.308
(loud heavy metal playing)

28:47.310 --> 28:49.678
(heavy metal stops)

28:59.621 --> 29:01.422
(exhales)

29:18.341 --> 29:20.710
(groans softly)

29:22.814 --> 29:24.347
(fan whirring)

29:24.382 --> 29:27.151
(loud heavy metal playing)

29:39.398 --> 29:40.798
(water sploshes)

29:48.139 --> 29:49.706
(water sploshes)

29:58.549 --> 30:00.517
(exhales)

30:03.554 --> 30:05.722
(fan whirring)

30:07.592 --> 30:10.360
(loud heavy metal playing)

30:18.102 --> 30:20.738
(heavy metal stops)

30:20.772 --> 30:22.173
Saul...

30:22.207 --> 30:24.175
looks like he's getting ready.

30:26.012 --> 30:29.314
Eight names--
four in Islamabad, three in Lahore,

30:29.349 --> 30:30.749
one in Larkana.

30:30.784 --> 30:33.318
That's gonna take some doing.

30:33.353 --> 30:35.687
First we need
a show of faith from you.

30:35.721 --> 30:37.355
Do you understand
what that means?

30:39.958 --> 30:42.726
I don't know anything.

30:42.760 --> 30:45.062
You know I don't.

30:45.096 --> 30:47.063
That is how we operate--

30:47.097 --> 30:50.066
for exactly this reason.

30:50.100 --> 30:52.202
Say good-bye to your family.

31:21.800 --> 31:24.101
An e-mail address in Pakistan.

31:24.135 --> 31:26.736
Whose e-mail?

31:26.771 --> 31:28.738
I don't know.

31:29.974 --> 31:31.741
I swear to you.

31:33.777 --> 31:35.645
Now you promise...

31:35.680 --> 31:37.948
my family...

31:37.982 --> 31:39.383
my children.

31:39.417 --> 31:41.252
What do you send to
this e-mail address?

31:41.286 --> 31:45.624
I forward ones sent to me
from someone else.

31:45.658 --> 31:47.226
Who?

31:56.303 --> 32:00.073
Was the location of the compound where
you were holding Sergeant Brody

32:00.107 --> 32:02.508
deliberately leaked to us so we would find him?
Carrie. Carrie.

32:02.543 --> 32:05.512
Did Abu Nazir ever
meet Sergeant Brody?

32:05.546 --> 32:06.913
(chair creaks)

32:06.947 --> 32:08.247
First...

32:08.281 --> 32:10.316
my family.

32:10.350 --> 32:12.050
Then we talk.

32:16.022 --> 32:18.591
We'll be back.

32:39.714 --> 32:40.814
Come on in.

32:40.848 --> 32:42.449
Thank you for meeting me, sir.

32:42.483 --> 32:44.851
You know, when I told you
my door was always open,

32:44.885 --> 32:46.319
Sergeant Brody, I meant it.

32:46.354 --> 32:47.821
Good timing--
it appears

32:47.855 --> 32:49.622
our friend in the safe house

32:49.657 --> 32:50.957
is getting ready to do business.

32:50.992 --> 32:52.292
No friend of mine, sir.

32:52.326 --> 32:54.027
Uh, no, no. 'Course not.

32:54.061 --> 32:56.496
What can I do for you, Sergeant?

32:58.065 --> 33:00.167
I believe I've earned a moment

33:00.201 --> 33:02.502
face-to-face
with my torturer, sir.

33:04.539 --> 33:07.507
Yeah, I, uh... I heard.

33:07.542 --> 33:09.876
And I've got to tell you
that Carrie was correct.

33:09.910 --> 33:11.311
She doesn't have
the authorization

33:11.345 --> 33:13.479
to let you in there with Hamid.
Do you?

33:13.514 --> 33:15.581
As much as I'd like to...

33:15.615 --> 33:17.015
Sir, can I stop you there,

33:17.050 --> 33:18.417
save you the trouble?

33:18.451 --> 33:20.252
Please.

33:20.286 --> 33:22.420
Nobody respects your
operational concerns

33:22.454 --> 33:24.188
more than I do.

33:24.223 --> 33:27.157
I did not come here to tell you
that I can get Hamid talking

33:27.192 --> 33:28.859
any quicker than
your own experts can.

33:28.893 --> 33:31.395
But yesterday, I did exactly

33:31.429 --> 33:35.032
as was asked of me,
hard as it was just to sit there

33:35.066 --> 33:36.600
and watch us dance around
his rights,

33:36.634 --> 33:38.603
after what he did to me
for eight years.

33:40.706 --> 33:42.540
Now you're telling me

33:42.575 --> 33:44.409
he's ready to talk.

33:45.945 --> 33:47.513
I think that means
I've earned the right

33:47.547 --> 33:49.715
to at least look him in the eye,
and tell him

33:49.750 --> 33:51.918
that he didn't beat me,
he doesn't get to win...

33:51.952 --> 33:53.553
Sergeant Brody...
Sir, I haven't finished,

33:53.587 --> 33:55.054
if you don't mind.

33:55.089 --> 33:57.523
This is really important to me.

34:00.293 --> 34:04.129
I need to do right
by my wife and my kids,

34:04.163 --> 34:06.798
and I need to be fully able,
both physically and mentally,

34:06.832 --> 34:09.400
to honor my duties
as a Marine and as a man.

34:09.434 --> 34:13.737
But first, I got to close
the door on this chapter

34:13.772 --> 34:15.639
of my life.

34:17.676 --> 34:19.277
That's all I ask, sir.

34:22.447 --> 34:25.416
Please don't rob me of the
opportunity to do that.

34:25.449 --> 34:28.820
For my own sanity,
if nothing else.

34:35.027 --> 34:37.129
Sergeant, would you, uh,

34:37.163 --> 34:39.164
would you wait outside
for a second?

34:52.279 --> 34:54.246
Lorraine, will you
get me the DCI.

34:54.281 --> 34:56.282
Yes, sir. Right away.

35:12.798 --> 35:13.798
Let's, uh...

35:18.705 --> 35:21.808
Let's go close that door,
Sergeant.

35:29.017 --> 35:31.353
We sent a phantom e-mail
to the one Hamid gave you.

35:31.387 --> 35:32.955
Whoever it is
will never actually

35:32.989 --> 35:35.356
receive the e-mail
or know that it was sent.

35:35.391 --> 35:37.626
So far, it's bounced
off of a server in Rio,

35:37.660 --> 35:38.894
where it went through

35:38.928 --> 35:41.030
a re-encryption
filtering protocol,

35:41.064 --> 35:43.232
then to Johannesburg--
same drill--

35:43.266 --> 35:46.234
then to Thailand,
then Finland, and now,

35:46.269 --> 35:48.237
nearly an hour later,
your guess is as...

35:48.271 --> 35:50.038
(computer chimes)

35:52.236 --> 35:54.876
I'd say you owe me dinner,
Carrie.

35:54.910 --> 35:56.878
Possibly even sex.

35:56.912 --> 35:59.179
Holy fuck.

35:59.214 --> 36:00.681
I wouldn't go that far.

36:00.715 --> 36:02.416
(sighs):
Jesus Christ.

36:07.855 --> 36:10.256
The 14th man gave up
an e-mail address we just traced

36:10.290 --> 36:12.525
to the Engineering Department
at Bryden University.

36:12.559 --> 36:14.393
Faisel? Are you
fucking kidding me?

36:14.427 --> 36:15.895
The professor we
tailed then cleared?

36:15.929 --> 36:17.930
Correct. Everybody stop
what you're doing.

36:17.964 --> 36:19.665
Only thing I need you
to do right now

36:19.700 --> 36:22.235
is find this man: Raqim Faisel.

36:39.554 --> 36:41.855
Faisel hasn't been
at the university all day.

36:41.890 --> 36:43.123
And he's not home, either.

36:43.158 --> 36:44.458
What home address
you got for him?

36:44.492 --> 36:46.093
An apartment in Truxton Circle.

36:46.128 --> 36:48.129
(sighs)

36:50.466 --> 36:52.433
(dialing)

36:54.435 --> 36:57.938
Virgil, I need you to look for
something at Bryden University.

36:57.972 --> 36:59.673
Yeah, today. Right now.

37:02.476 --> 37:05.044
(door opens)

37:07.981 --> 37:10.583
(door closes)

37:28.672 --> 37:32.475
You beat me.

37:32.510 --> 37:34.611
You humiliated me.

37:34.645 --> 37:37.880
You killed my friend.

37:39.716 --> 37:41.984
But you did not break me.

37:42.018 --> 37:44.753
You should've killed me

37:44.787 --> 37:47.655
when you had the chance.

37:47.690 --> 37:50.258
But now, here we are.

37:52.794 --> 37:57.365
I'm a sergeant in the United
States Marine Corps, shit-bird.

37:57.399 --> 37:59.434
How did you think
this would end?

38:06.376 --> 38:08.011
Hey! Hey, come on!

38:10.081 --> 38:12.449
(grunting)

38:14.652 --> 38:17.020
Calm down!

38:17.055 --> 38:18.021
Calm down.

38:18.055 --> 38:20.090
(Brody panting)

38:27.499 --> 38:28.999
Thank you, sir.

38:29.034 --> 38:30.568
Means a lot.

38:30.602 --> 38:32.469
(Hamid speaking Arabic)

38:39.011 --> 38:40.646
VIRGIL:
<i>Fact is,</i>

38:40.680 --> 38:42.214
these eggheads
and whatnot may be

38:42.248 --> 38:44.316
smarter than all of us
put together in this room.

38:44.350 --> 38:45.817
But what I learned
over the years,

38:45.852 --> 38:47.719
when it comes to safety
in the workplace,

38:47.754 --> 38:50.589
you would not believe some of
the violations that I've seen.

38:50.623 --> 38:54.893
Can't you come back when
Dr. Faisel is actually here?

38:54.927 --> 38:57.328
I'm not comfortable letting
people in his office

38:57.363 --> 38:58.363
when he's not present.

38:58.397 --> 39:00.198
We understand, ma'am.

39:05.905 --> 39:09.508
Um, look, uh,
if we damaged anything,

39:09.542 --> 39:12.210
I can put in the paperwork
to pay for it.

39:12.244 --> 39:15.280
Maybe we can help you
with one or two of

39:15.314 --> 39:16.281
the violations in here.

39:16.315 --> 39:18.048
Excuse me?

39:18.083 --> 39:19.717
Are-Are you
suggesting...

39:19.752 --> 39:21.352
No, he's not.
Not on my watch.

39:21.386 --> 39:22.753
Just do the paperwork,
numb nuts.

39:23.788 --> 39:24.922
(phone ringing)

39:24.956 --> 39:26.457
Yes, we have a few

39:26.491 --> 39:28.125
potential violations
we'd like to report.

39:28.159 --> 39:29.893
That could be Dr.
Faisel calling now.

39:29.928 --> 39:31.061
Hey.
Hello.

39:31.096 --> 39:32.362
Know where this address is?

39:32.397 --> 39:33.630
Hello?

39:33.665 --> 39:34.831
Right next to
the fucking airport.

39:39.937 --> 39:42.405
Hey.

39:44.274 --> 39:45.941
See that new belt he's wearing?

39:47.177 --> 39:49.077
Yeah.

39:49.112 --> 39:50.278
Blue.

39:50.313 --> 39:51.246
Impressive.

39:51.280 --> 39:53.281
I'm sorry I missed it.

39:53.316 --> 39:54.449
I wish I'd been there, son.

39:54.484 --> 39:55.918
I got caught up at a meeting.

39:55.952 --> 39:57.486
It's okay.

39:57.521 --> 39:59.155
Mike took me.

39:59.189 --> 40:00.723
Yeah, I see that.

40:00.758 --> 40:02.258
MIKE: Ice cream?
No, I'm good, thanks.

40:02.293 --> 40:04.294
Have some.
We're celebrating.

40:10.168 --> 40:12.904
Anyway, I should hit the road.

40:12.938 --> 40:16.440
Did your mom ask Uncle Mike
to take you to karate?

40:16.475 --> 40:18.109
MIKE:
It's no big deal.

40:18.143 --> 40:19.410
I've been taking him

40:19.444 --> 40:21.445
for the last, uh, three years.

40:21.479 --> 40:22.646
CHRIS:
Four.

40:22.680 --> 40:24.114
I started when I was eight.

40:24.148 --> 40:25.649
MIKE: Right. And look
at you now.

40:25.683 --> 40:26.650
A blue belt.

40:26.684 --> 40:28.251
Pretty damn awesome, huh?

40:28.286 --> 40:29.353
Right, Brody?

40:29.387 --> 40:31.421
You bet.

40:37.127 --> 40:38.795
What meeting?

40:38.829 --> 40:40.496
I can't talk about it.

40:43.067 --> 40:44.300
Your son did awesome today.

40:44.335 --> 40:45.401
You should be proud.

40:47.538 --> 40:50.506
Didn't you say you
were leaving, Mike?

40:52.710 --> 40:54.010
See you later, bud, okay?

40:54.045 --> 40:55.412
Later, gator.

41:01.152 --> 41:03.621
(door opens, closes)

41:03.656 --> 41:04.989
Got any sprinkles?

41:07.493 --> 41:09.861
CARRIE: <i>He led us right past this house</i>
<i>just this last Tuesday.</i>

41:09.896 --> 41:11.829
VIRGIL: <i>Which probably means</i>
<i>he knew we were tailing him.</i>

41:11.864 --> 41:13.164
Should've had us do it.

41:13.198 --> 41:14.499
MAX:
Dead quiet in there.

41:14.533 --> 41:15.700
Not a squeak.

41:15.734 --> 41:18.002
Maybe they're taking a nap.

41:18.036 --> 41:21.738
Sometimes, I swear to God,
he's my own brother,

41:21.773 --> 41:23.240
and I don't know
if he's part moron

41:23.274 --> 41:24.907
or just acting like
it to piss me off.

41:24.942 --> 41:27.910
(cell phone ringing)

41:27.944 --> 41:30.379
What's going on, Saul?

41:30.413 --> 41:32.180
SAUL:
He's dead, Carrie.

41:34.251 --> 41:36.986
Hamid's dead.

41:37.020 --> 41:38.354
Suicide.

41:38.388 --> 41:40.523
Jesus Christ, no.

41:40.558 --> 41:42.058
Wha-- How?

41:42.093 --> 41:43.760
When?
Carrie, what happened?

41:43.795 --> 41:44.862
Minutes ago.

41:44.896 --> 41:46.697
I just got here.

41:46.732 --> 41:48.032
Body's still warm.

41:48.067 --> 41:49.901
How the hell is that possible?

41:49.935 --> 41:53.171
Razor blade fragment,
left wrist.

41:53.206 --> 41:55.673
What? Where did he get that?

41:55.708 --> 41:59.044
H-He must have had
it on his person.

41:59.078 --> 42:00.279
We missed it.

42:00.313 --> 42:01.746
Saul, he had to have
gone through

42:01.781 --> 42:04.416
at least a dozen
full body searches.

42:04.450 --> 42:08.386
The fragment is tiny.

42:08.420 --> 42:11.588
He could have had it
concealed in a cavity

42:11.623 --> 42:16.593
or under his skin
in scar tissue.

42:16.627 --> 42:18.228
Or somebody passed it to him.

42:18.262 --> 42:19.429
Passed him what?

42:19.463 --> 42:21.264
Carrie...

42:21.298 --> 42:23.266
Admit it's possible, Saul,
because we're sitting on

42:23.300 --> 42:24.600
Dr. Faisel's
house right now,

42:24.635 --> 42:25.868
and there's no sign
of him anywhere.

42:25.903 --> 42:28.070
What's your point?

42:28.105 --> 42:29.738
My point is, whoever gave
Hamid the razor blade

42:29.773 --> 42:30.940
could have warned
the professor, too.

42:30.974 --> 42:33.642
A fucking razor blade?

42:33.676 --> 42:35.710
I want authorization to go in.

42:35.744 --> 42:37.779
Estes wants us
to watch and wait.

42:37.813 --> 42:39.614
Damn it, Saul, there's no time!

42:39.648 --> 42:42.450
If Faisel is on the run,
we need to know now.

42:42.484 --> 42:45.052
You have my authorization.

42:45.086 --> 42:46.553
Move in.

42:48.623 --> 42:50.390
Alpha team, go.

42:50.425 --> 42:52.292
Bravo, cover the back.

42:52.327 --> 42:53.727
Charlie team, stand by.

42:59.468 --> 43:02.204
Here we go.

43:22.892 --> 43:24.926
MAN: House is empty.
He must have left in a hurry.

43:24.961 --> 43:26.094
Looks like for good.

43:26.128 --> 43:28.162
Did you hear that, Saul?

43:28.197 --> 43:29.630
Saul?

43:31.666 --> 43:33.701
Saul?

43:33.736 --> 43:35.737
(speaking Hebrew)

43:44.347 --> 43:46.314
(Saul continues speaking Hebrew)

43:57.594 --> 43:58.961
(door closes)

43:58.995 --> 44:02.598
(footsteps approaching)

44:03.599 --> 44:05.333
I'm so sorry.

44:05.368 --> 44:06.835
(exhales)

44:06.869 --> 44:10.038
I know what you're gonna
say, and you're right.

44:10.072 --> 44:14.509
All I can say is this is not how
I planned your first days back.

44:17.613 --> 44:19.214
You must still be
jet-lagged.

44:19.248 --> 44:21.049
Why are you still up?

44:21.084 --> 44:23.752
You should be in bed.

44:23.787 --> 44:25.888
I know that look.

44:25.923 --> 44:28.191
You been waiting up for me.

44:28.225 --> 44:30.527
What's wrong?
Saul, darling,

44:30.561 --> 44:33.496
you know what's wrong-- you just more
or less said so in a nutshell yours...

44:33.531 --> 44:37.033
Wait, wait. Please
not do this right now.

44:37.067 --> 44:39.502
Do you mind?

44:39.536 --> 44:42.538
It's been a very, um...

44:42.572 --> 44:44.707
complicated day.

44:44.741 --> 44:47.777
Your life is a very
complicated day.

44:53.249 --> 44:55.350
You must...
be aware, Saul,

44:55.385 --> 44:58.887
this last month in
India with my family

44:58.921 --> 45:02.724
I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

45:02.758 --> 45:05.160
Soul searching.

45:08.064 --> 45:10.432
We discussed this
before you left.

45:10.466 --> 45:12.034
I can start scaling back,

45:12.068 --> 45:14.636
maybe even get reassigned,
spend more time at home.

45:14.670 --> 45:16.672
Just listen.

45:17.841 --> 45:19.475
I actually realize now

45:19.509 --> 45:22.378
it's not right or fair
to ask you to do less.

45:22.413 --> 45:24.715
So what I need--

45:24.749 --> 45:26.049
me, Mira--

45:26.084 --> 45:30.087
is to make my life
not just about you.

45:31.356 --> 45:33.390
You know,

45:33.425 --> 45:35.759
you said yesterday
that my parents

45:35.794 --> 45:38.429
should pass
the Mumbai slums project

45:38.463 --> 45:41.164
onto someone else.
Not to you. I didn't mean to you.

45:41.199 --> 45:42.799
Our life is here, Mira.

45:44.535 --> 45:47.737
Our life is
wherever you get sent--

45:47.772 --> 45:49.906
Amman, Beirut, London, Aden--

45:49.940 --> 45:52.809
often at a moment's notice,
and I need more than that.

45:52.843 --> 45:55.045
I need to make my life...

45:56.314 --> 45:58.681
I need to make my life

45:58.716 --> 45:59.782
about my passion.

45:59.817 --> 46:01.751
I need to put my
roots down somewhere

46:01.785 --> 46:03.653
that matter to me, Saul.

46:03.687 --> 46:07.623
(doorbell rings)
Do I get any sort of say in all this?

46:12.228 --> 46:14.997
Are you gonna get that?

46:25.042 --> 46:26.276
Mira.

46:26.310 --> 46:27.978
How was your trip?
Welcome home.

46:28.012 --> 46:29.946
Uh, um, it was wonderful.

46:29.981 --> 46:31.381
It was an inspiring time.

46:31.416 --> 46:32.616
How are you...

46:32.651 --> 46:34.218
Carrie?

46:34.252 --> 46:36.521
I'm so sorry, I really
didn't mean to intrude.

46:36.555 --> 46:39.056
However...
It's really important that I talk to you.

46:39.091 --> 46:41.192
It's, uh, so lovely to see you,

46:41.226 --> 46:42.827
but I didn't sleep
on the plane,

46:42.861 --> 46:44.729
so I'm completely
sideways. Forgive me.

46:44.763 --> 46:46.898
We'll catch up soon.
That'd be great.

46:46.932 --> 46:48.566
Good night.

46:53.572 --> 46:57.909
Don't say I didn't warn you this whole
thing would blow up in our faces.

47:01.247 --> 47:03.047
SAUL:
What the hell?

47:03.081 --> 47:04.815
Who let Brody in
that room with him?

47:04.850 --> 47:06.016
Who do you think, Saul?

47:06.051 --> 47:08.085
Jesus fucking Christ.

47:08.119 --> 47:10.687
Yep, I had pretty much
the same response.

47:10.721 --> 47:13.323
(sighs) Brody must
have identified

47:13.358 --> 47:15.393
that camera blind spot while
watching the interrogation.

47:15.427 --> 47:17.061
SAUL:
Just so you know,

47:17.095 --> 47:18.763
the working theory
is that Hamid smuggled

47:18.798 --> 47:21.500
the razor blade inside
the soul of his shoe.

47:21.534 --> 47:25.939
Bullshit! I mean, not only did Brody
contrive to get himself in the room,

47:25.973 --> 47:27.240
he orchestrated Hamid's suicide

47:27.274 --> 47:28.574
and he warned Dr. Faisel.

47:28.609 --> 47:31.278
And we-- you and I--
let it happen.

47:31.312 --> 47:33.713
(low grunt)

47:33.747 --> 47:36.249
Enough on the sidelines,
enough in the shadows--

47:36.283 --> 47:39.218
we need to take this up the chain
before we're counting bodies

47:39.253 --> 47:41.788
and trying to spin yet another
monumental intelligence screw-up.

47:41.822 --> 47:43.789
Don't think I'm
not considering it.

47:43.824 --> 47:45.591
Well, how about doing
something about it?

47:45.625 --> 47:47.092
Because nothing's
changed, Carrie.

47:49.062 --> 47:51.729
Wh-Wh... What do you
mean, nothing's changed?

47:51.764 --> 47:54.466
I don't see Brody giving
Hamid a damn thing, do you?

47:54.500 --> 47:57.035
Not a razor blade,
not a goddamn summer cold.

47:57.070 --> 47:59.104
Good! You know?
Get angry!

47:59.139 --> 48:01.307
I'm over your whole
detached routine.

48:01.341 --> 48:03.576
(whispers):
You're out of line.

48:03.611 --> 48:06.213
This is my home. Get out...
I'm going to Estes

48:06.247 --> 48:07.881
with or without your approval.
Take some boxes with you,

48:07.916 --> 48:11.218
'cause you're gonna need 'em
when you clean out your desk.

48:11.253 --> 48:16.056
What happened to the Saul Berenson
that trekked the Karakoram,

48:16.090 --> 48:18.658
did three months in
a Malaysian prison

48:18.693 --> 48:21.460
stared down Uday Hussein
at the height of his power?

48:21.495 --> 48:24.630
When did you become
such a pussy, Saul?

48:24.664 --> 48:27.933
(whispers):
I think you should leave now.

48:27.967 --> 48:29.401
With pleasure.

48:29.435 --> 48:30.569
You know what?
You can keep that.

48:30.603 --> 48:32.471
Fuck this shit!

48:34.307 --> 48:35.775
(door opens)

48:35.809 --> 48:37.243
(door slams)

48:55.798 --> 48:59.067
(panting quietly)

49:02.204 --> 49:04.605
(panting)

49:10.545 --> 49:12.879
(crickets chirping)

49:23.591 --> 49:26.226
Carrie.
(crying): I'm sorry, Maggie.

49:26.260 --> 49:29.563
I didn't know where else to go.
Oh, God, what happened?

49:29.598 --> 49:32.500
I think I just quit my job.

49:32.534 --> 49:34.535
MAGGIE:
What? Don't be silly.

49:34.570 --> 49:36.904
No, I'm serious.
I'm done. I'm done!

49:36.938 --> 49:40.574
I've had it up to here.
All right, just stop. Stop.

49:40.609 --> 49:42.911
Stop.

49:42.945 --> 49:45.980
You were so right,
you were so fuckin' right

49:46.015 --> 49:49.984
- when you told me that my job would kill me
one day. - Just take a deep breath.

49:50.019 --> 49:51.919
Calm down, 'kay, Carrie?

49:51.954 --> 49:53.988
Carrie, just calm down, okay?

49:55.424 --> 49:58.392
Does Saul know about any of this?
Saul?

49:58.426 --> 50:00.661
No, S-Saul is part
of the problem.

50:00.696 --> 50:02.430
But you said he
always had your back.

50:02.464 --> 50:05.833
Well, I'm on my own now,
that's for damn sure.

50:05.867 --> 50:08.269
Do you really want
to know the truth?

50:09.871 --> 50:13.007
I've been on my own for a while now.
Stop.

50:13.041 --> 50:15.209
We both know you're not
quitting anything, okay?

50:15.244 --> 50:17.011
It's just the heat
of the moment,

50:17.045 --> 50:19.013
it's not you, okay?

50:19.047 --> 50:22.183
That's not who you really
are-- I know you. So...

50:22.217 --> 50:23.951
this is what's gonna happen.

50:23.986 --> 50:25.953
You're sleeping here
tonight, okay?

50:25.987 --> 50:28.889
My guest room's
already made up.

50:28.923 --> 50:31.858
The girls are gonna be over the
moon to see you in the morning.

50:31.892 --> 50:33.560
Yeah.
(laughs): 'Kay?

50:33.594 --> 50:36.029
Listen, I don't care if
the world's about to end,

50:36.063 --> 50:39.265
okay, you're gonna stay here
for as long as it takes

50:39.300 --> 50:41.434
for you to get
your head straight.

50:41.469 --> 50:43.469
'Kay?

50:51.111 --> 50:54.747
Promise me that you'll
sleep in in the morning.

50:54.782 --> 50:56.082
I'll try.

50:56.116 --> 50:57.450
Hey, thank you.

50:58.818 --> 51:00.219
Aunt Carrie?

51:00.253 --> 51:02.388
Hey.

51:02.422 --> 51:03.589
What's wrong?

51:03.624 --> 51:05.158
Nothing, sweetheart.

51:05.192 --> 51:07.828
Did something happen?
We heard you and Mom talking.

51:07.862 --> 51:09.396
No, girls, really, I'm fine.

51:09.431 --> 51:11.632
Why don't you girls
get back to bed

51:11.666 --> 51:14.668
and let Aunt Carrie
get some rest, okay?

51:14.702 --> 51:16.670
Can we sleep in here?

51:16.705 --> 51:19.173
Yeah. Please?

51:19.207 --> 51:21.442
(laughs)

51:21.477 --> 51:23.444
You sure?
I'm positive.

51:23.478 --> 51:24.945
Come on in.

51:24.980 --> 51:26.513
MAGGIE:
Get in there.

51:26.548 --> 51:28.515
I'm sleeping right here.

51:28.550 --> 51:30.350
(speaks indistinctly)

51:30.385 --> 51:31.785
Okay.

51:31.819 --> 51:33.486
Sweet dreams, guys.

51:33.521 --> 51:35.589
(laughs)

51:35.623 --> 51:36.823
Mwa!

51:38.326 --> 51:39.493
Mwa!

51:48.370 --> 51:50.973
Hey, no, stay there.

51:51.007 --> 51:53.141
Stay there.

52:00.049 --> 52:01.416
(exhales)

52:03.219 --> 52:06.387
You know, I meant it when I said
I wouldn't miss your karate.

52:07.723 --> 52:09.690
I screwed up.

52:09.725 --> 52:11.692
I'm sorry.

52:13.428 --> 52:15.062
Can you forgive me?

52:17.099 --> 52:19.868
I'm proud of you.

52:20.903 --> 52:24.039
You're a blue belt now.

52:24.073 --> 52:26.474
You got it done,
like I knew you would.

52:26.509 --> 52:29.344
You know why?

52:29.378 --> 52:30.979
'Cause you're my son.

52:33.850 --> 52:36.718
What are we praying for?

52:36.752 --> 52:39.587
Since I was four,

52:39.622 --> 52:42.558
me and Mom prayed
every night...

52:42.592 --> 52:45.226
that you were alive...

52:45.261 --> 52:47.329
that you'd come home one day.

52:47.363 --> 52:49.531
And now?

52:50.967 --> 52:53.602
That you're gonna be okay.

53:06.550 --> 53:08.719
♪ ♪

53:40.450 --> 53:41.983
Auntie Carrie?

53:42.017 --> 53:44.152
(whispering):
Shh... Close your eyes.

53:44.187 --> 53:47.055
Close your eyes.
What are you doing?

53:47.090 --> 53:51.160
(sighs) Nothing, Pumpkin.
I just can't sleep.

Are you worried
about the bad guys?

53:54.431 --> 53:58.101
What bad guys, Josie?

53:59.537 --> 54:02.473
You know, the ones
who blow people up.

54:04.176 --> 54:05.777
Are you worried?

54:05.811 --> 54:07.379
A little.

54:08.448 --> 54:11.283
Yeah. Me, too.

54:11.317 --> 54:13.286
I have an idea.

54:13.320 --> 54:15.120

54:29.171 --> 54:30.871
