Don't step on them.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.137
Wow.

00:38.172 --> 00:40.639
They really do look like angels.

00:40.674 --> 00:42.374
Told you.

00:42.410 --> 00:43.909
Do you believe in angels?

00:43.944 --> 00:45.444
Of course.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.746
You make that sound like
you've seen them before.

00:47.782 --> 00:49.381
Like for real.

00:49.417 --> 00:52.484
You don't have to see
something to believe in it.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.453
You don't see God, do you?

00:57.458 --> 00:58.624
Are you cold?

00:58.659 --> 00:59.792
Yeah.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.760
Come on.

01:04.864 --> 01:06.999
I think I lost my gloves again.

01:07.034 --> 01:08.634
Do you know where they are?

01:08.669 --> 01:10.936
We can share.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.573
And put your other hand here.

01:22.550 --> 01:25.951
I guess I should go back
to my room.

01:25.986 --> 01:27.653
Yeah, me too.

01:28.856 --> 01:31.990
Wait, one more thing.

01:35.396 --> 01:36.462
Nope.

01:36.497 --> 01:37.196
I wasn't ready.

01:37.231 --> 01:37.696
Ok.

01:37.731 --> 01:39.498
[laughs]

01:39.533 --> 01:40.666
Close your eyes.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.034
Trust me.

01:42.069 --> 01:43.635
Ok.

01:56.851 --> 01:57.683
Ok.

01:57.718 --> 01:58.684
What time do you open
your presents?

01:58.719 --> 02:00.519
As early as possible.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.988
But let's get together
right after that, ok?

02:03.023 --> 02:03.889
Ok.

02:03.924 --> 02:05.023
Merry Christmas.

02:05.059 --> 02:07.059
The best Christmas ever.

02:07.094 --> 02:09.026
Best ever.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.137
Mom?

02:18.172 --> 02:19.104
Dad?

02:19.140 --> 02:21.940
I'm really sorry but I lost
my gloves again.

02:24.512 --> 02:26.545
Mom?

02:29.183 --> 02:31.183
Where is dad?

02:33.187 --> 02:40.392
He um... he left, honey.

02:40.427 --> 02:45.030
But he's coming back,
right?

02:45.065 --> 02:46.732
'Cause it's Christmas Eve and...

02:46.767 --> 02:48.567
No.

02:48.602 --> 02:49.535
No, Maggie.

02:49.570 --> 02:52.004
I'm so sorry.

03:05.319 --> 03:08.287
It's gonna be ok, Maggie.

03:08.322 --> 03:10.923
Nothing's ever gonna
be ok again.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.057
Not ever.

03:12.092 --> 03:13.592
Not even Christmas.

03:13.627 --> 03:14.459
Let's get in the car, Maggie.

03:14.495 --> 03:16.261
It's time to go.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.231
Maggie, come on.

03:19.266 --> 03:21.767
Don't stop believing, Maggie.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.602
Best Christmas ever.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.771
Believe in that.

03:41.655 --> 03:44.423
Hey, Lauren, this is Maggie.

03:44.458 --> 03:45.557
I got your message.

03:45.593 --> 03:49.094
You sounded a little upset
so I just wanted to call-

03:49.129 --> 03:50.495
excuse me, sorry.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.264
Sorry, I'm just leaving work
right now.

03:52.299 --> 03:55.334
Um, uh, I'm gonna pick up
Jordan after school,

03:55.369 --> 03:57.936
but I wanna talk to you.

03:57.972 --> 03:58.503
Thank you.

03:58.539 --> 03:59.438
So call me.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.406
I hope you're ok.

04:13.721 --> 04:16.755
How's my guy?

04:16.790 --> 04:18.357
Hey, where's Miss Klein?

04:18.392 --> 04:20.459
I don't know, but I'm starving.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.928
Well, you're supposed
to be chaperoned.

04:22.963 --> 04:23.795
It's fine.

04:23.831 --> 04:24.663
The other kids do it.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.265
I don't care what
the other kids do.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.666
I have an agreement
with the school.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.101
Mom, I'm not a baby.

04:29.136 --> 04:31.536
Oh, you think bad things
only happen to babies?

04:31.572 --> 04:32.938
Besides, it's fine.

04:32.973 --> 04:35.340
I'm, like, starving to death.

04:35.376 --> 04:38.443
Jordan, you're not,
like, starving.

04:38.479 --> 04:39.311
Ok?

04:39.346 --> 04:40.545
You're hungry or
you could be starving

04:40.581 --> 04:43.715
if you wanna be dramatic but
you're not, like, starving, ok?

04:43.751 --> 04:45.717
It doesn't make any sense.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.386
Come on.

04:47.421 --> 04:48.620
Nope, this way.

04:48.656 --> 04:49.521
Where are we going?

04:49.556 --> 04:52.291
I wanna have a talk
with Mrs. Deeley.

04:52.326 --> 04:54.192
Mom, don't do this.

04:54.228 --> 04:54.826
What?

04:54.862 --> 04:56.862
I'm not gonna do anything.

04:56.897 --> 04:58.363
I'm just gonna have a chat.

05:01.769 --> 05:03.669
Maggie.

05:03.704 --> 05:06.138
Mrs. Deeley, we had
an agreement.

05:06.173 --> 05:09.908
I can assure you, Miss Klein
is very conscientious.

05:09.943 --> 05:11.743
Who knows what could happen
to him out there.

05:11.779 --> 05:15.814
Our students
are perfectly safe.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.582
But I'll have a word
with her anyway.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.985
I appreciate that,
it's just...

05:20.020 --> 05:21.753
you can never be too careful.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.755
I see that.

05:23.791 --> 05:25.257
Well, thank you.

05:25.292 --> 05:28.694
Before you go, I was gonna
call you about something.

05:28.729 --> 05:32.564
I wanted to ask you how
Jordan is doing at home.

05:32.599 --> 05:33.732
What do you mean?

05:33.767 --> 05:34.666
It's nothing terrible,

05:34.702 --> 05:38.103
he's just not living up
to his potential.

05:38.138 --> 05:40.706
I thought you might consider
a tutor.

05:40.741 --> 05:44.209
A tutor?

05:44.244 --> 05:45.577
Why would he need a tutor?

05:45.612 --> 05:47.245
He's falling behind a bit.

05:47.281 --> 05:50.115
I mean, don't get me wrong,
he's a smart boy.

05:50.150 --> 05:53.251
He's just, uh, seems
a little distracted.

05:53.287 --> 05:56.788
Many of our students benefit
from more focused one-on-one-

05:56.824 --> 06:00.625
He doesn't need one-on-one
with a stranger.

06:00.661 --> 06:03.995
This is yesterday's math test.

06:10.738 --> 06:16.775
Here's the name of someone we've
had some good success with.

06:20.080 --> 06:24.449
Um... you know, I- I just
probably need to spend

06:24.485 --> 06:26.785
a little more time with him,
that's all.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.987
It was just a thought.

06:29.022 --> 06:32.991
And in the meantime, I hope
you have a Merry Christmas.

06:33.026 --> 06:34.426
Yeah, you too.

06:34.461 --> 06:36.228
Thank you.

06:37.197 --> 06:39.564
So what do you wanna do
for Christmas break?

06:39.600 --> 06:40.832
I don't know.

06:40.868 --> 06:41.800
Well, I was thinking

06:41.835 --> 06:44.569
maybe I would take a few days
off of work

06:44.605 --> 06:49.241
and maybe we could go to
a museum or the library.

06:49.276 --> 06:50.742
The library?

06:50.778 --> 06:52.644
Yes, the library.

06:52.679 --> 06:53.979
You know, education
does not stop

06:54.014 --> 06:56.181
just 'cause of some holiday,
alright?

06:56.216 --> 06:59.017
Every single day of your life
is another step at

06:59.052 --> 07:01.019
[together] forging
your place in this world.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.287
Don't be smart.

07:02.322 --> 07:03.121
I can't help it.

07:03.157 --> 07:05.624
I'm still dizzy
from the starvation.

07:05.659 --> 07:06.625
Well, guess what?

07:06.660 --> 07:09.294
I have a surprise for you
when we get home.

07:09.329 --> 07:10.462
We're getting a real tree?

07:10.497 --> 07:11.096
No.

07:11.131 --> 07:12.998
No, they're a fire hazard.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.699
You always say that.

07:14.735 --> 07:17.335
Well, that's 'cause
it's always true.

07:17.371 --> 07:19.504
And plus they're dirty.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.639
Guess again.

07:27.080 --> 07:31.216
Uh, dad's coming home,
right?

07:31.251 --> 07:32.717
No.

07:32.753 --> 07:33.952
Baby, dad's not coming home.

07:33.987 --> 07:35.720
You know that.

07:35.756 --> 07:40.225
But grams is coming into town.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.560
What's that face for?

07:41.595 --> 07:43.028
Is she staying until Christmas?

07:43.063 --> 07:43.695
Yeah.

07:43.730 --> 07:45.997
Staying the whole two weeks.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.098
Oh, I bet the first thing
she's gonna say

07:47.134 --> 07:51.136
when she sees me is
"look how much you've grown".

07:51.171 --> 07:52.637
[laughs]

07:52.673 --> 07:54.506
So is what she's gonna say.

07:54.541 --> 07:56.475
Ok, buckle up.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.848
Oh, look how much
you've grown.

08:02.883 --> 08:06.551
My goodness, like a little weed.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.386
A little weed?

08:08.422 --> 08:09.254
Mom.

08:09.289 --> 08:09.921
Hi, hon.

08:09.957 --> 08:10.689
Good to see you.

08:10.724 --> 08:12.023
You too.

08:12.059 --> 08:13.492
How was your trip in?

08:13.527 --> 08:15.160
Well, it wasn't exactly zippy.

08:15.195 --> 08:16.895
Yeah, all that
holiday craziness.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.096
I just love it.

08:18.131 --> 08:20.065
Well, it gave me lots of time
to look at all the lights.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.833
I just love Christmas
in the city.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.335
Me too.

08:23.370 --> 08:24.402
With Christmas trees.

08:24.438 --> 08:26.705
I heard that.

08:26.740 --> 08:27.906
Here you go.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.608
Did you think that you were
going to the Arctic Circle?

08:29.643 --> 08:30.475
We have heat.

08:30.511 --> 08:32.844
Well, it doesn't hurt
to be prepared.

08:32.880 --> 08:33.879
You know what?

08:33.914 --> 08:35.514
I brought you something.

08:35.549 --> 08:36.715
Now, let me find it.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.015
Oh no.

08:39.285 --> 08:40.684
Here we are.

08:40.721 --> 08:42.953
A little San Diego Christmas
for your tree.

08:42.990 --> 08:43.889
Awe.

08:43.924 --> 08:44.923
Thank you.

08:44.958 --> 08:45.557
Look at that.

08:45.592 --> 08:46.391
Santa's surfing.

08:46.426 --> 08:47.292
How cool.

08:47.327 --> 08:48.460
Did you put up a tree?

08:48.495 --> 08:49.728
Yeah.

08:49.763 --> 08:51.263
A fake one.

08:51.298 --> 08:54.366
Mom thinks the real ones
are dirty.

08:54.401 --> 08:56.535
Maggie, that is the silliest
thing I've ever heard.

08:56.570 --> 08:57.536
You know what?

08:57.571 --> 08:58.637
Hey baby, will you find
somewhere to put these?

08:58.672 --> 09:02.908
Mom, I'm sure we should get
you settled in, right?

09:02.943 --> 09:04.109
I bet you're exhausted.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.076
Come on.

09:05.112 --> 09:06.711
What do you have in this thing?

09:06.747 --> 09:08.213
Not much.

09:11.084 --> 09:13.618
Ok guys, thank you.

09:13.654 --> 09:14.819
Alright, so I need
a couple days.

09:14.855 --> 09:15.720
Maybe three.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.789
Is there anything you can
move around?

09:17.824 --> 09:18.757
Well, you've got a meeting

09:18.792 --> 09:20.559
with the Blackwell's attorney
later today.

09:20.594 --> 09:23.128
Uh, yeah.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.596
I think I can reschedule that.

09:24.631 --> 09:27.265
That way I can pick up Jordan
after lunch.

09:27.301 --> 09:29.434
But you've got the partner's
meeting at 4:00.

09:29.469 --> 09:31.503
Oh, I forgot about that.

09:31.538 --> 09:33.772
And you're in court every day
the rest of the week.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.240
Are you kidding?

09:35.275 --> 09:37.075
You have some open days
after the first.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.476
That's not gonna work.

09:38.512 --> 09:41.780
Oh, and your friend Lauren
has called twice.

09:41.815 --> 09:42.914
[sighs]

09:42.950 --> 09:44.182
Ok, alright.

09:44.217 --> 09:49.354
Um, just call Lauren back and
set up a meeting for whenever.

09:49.389 --> 09:50.422
Ok.

09:50.457 --> 09:51.623
And you wanted me to remind
you about the tutor.

09:51.658 --> 09:52.924
Yes, yes, yes.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.192
Thank you.

09:54.227 --> 09:56.494
Oh, and Maggie?

09:56.530 --> 09:58.430
Breathe.

09:58.465 --> 10:00.231
Thanks.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.473
Yes sir.

10:08.508 --> 10:11.943
Alright, which tree can I
interest you in?

10:14.881 --> 10:16.314
Alright.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.016
Thank you so much.

10:18.051 --> 10:18.783
Thank you.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.452
Merry Christmas.

10:22.589 --> 10:26.992
Something like this?

10:27.027 --> 10:29.060
It's one of a kind, it's made
from antique linens

10:29.096 --> 10:32.330
that have been naturally
colored with flowers.

10:32.366 --> 10:37.902
The yellow is from calendula
and the pink is from amaranth.

10:37.938 --> 10:38.903
It's gorgeous.

10:38.939 --> 10:40.038
Yeah.

10:40.073 --> 10:40.672
Take a look.

10:40.707 --> 10:41.873
And it's for a good cause.

10:41.908 --> 10:42.841
The women that make it,

10:42.876 --> 10:45.744
they run a cancer clinic
up in Vermont, so...

10:45.779 --> 10:47.012
Merry Christmas.

10:47.047 --> 10:47.879
Hi.

10:47.914 --> 10:49.681
Uh, I'm trying to reach
Casey Cummins.

10:49.716 --> 10:51.516
<i>Sorry, it's really noisy
in here.</i>

10:51.551 --> 10:53.084
<i>I was actually trying to reach,</i>

10:53.120 --> 10:55.654
uh, Mr. Cummins, the tutor.

10:55.689 --> 10:56.755
<i>That is me.</i>

10:56.790 --> 10:58.590
And I tutor a number of kids
at the Brownley school.

10:58.625 --> 11:01.359
Yeah, that's- that's where
my son, Jordan, goes.

11:01.395 --> 11:03.528
He actually needs a little help
with math.

11:03.563 --> 11:04.095
Oh.

11:04.131 --> 11:04.863
Ok, great.

11:04.898 --> 11:05.563
How old's Jordan?

11:05.599 --> 11:07.499
Um, do you take credit cards?

11:07.534 --> 11:10.101
Um, sorry, Maggie was it?

11:10.137 --> 11:11.069
Maggie Wright.

11:11.104 --> 11:12.937
Uh, do you mind terribly
if I call you back?

11:12.973 --> 11:14.439
It's just really hectic
where I am.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.441
Uh, yeah, that's-
that's fine.

11:16.476 --> 11:17.409
In fact, you know what?

11:17.444 --> 11:18.910
Let me just call you back later.

11:18.945 --> 11:19.711
Sure.

11:19.746 --> 11:20.679
Yeah, you can call me.

11:20.714 --> 11:24.115
Um, or if you prefer
you can stop by and uh,

11:24.151 --> 11:25.116
meet me in person.

11:25.152 --> 11:26.584
<i>Uh, I have a diner.</i>

11:26.620 --> 11:28.653
<i>It's at 221 Maple Lane.</i>

11:29.322 --> 11:30.488
<i>Ok.</i>

11:30.524 --> 11:35.260
Uh, well then, Mr. Cummins,
I will call you back later.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.861
Ok, bye.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.463
I'm so sorry about that.

11:38.498 --> 11:39.097
You wanna buy it?

11:39.132 --> 11:39.964
Mmmhmm.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.466
Great choice.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.935
So how did he sound?

11:43.970 --> 11:45.804
Distracted.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.772
Definitely didn't sound
like a tutor.

11:47.808 --> 11:50.375
And what exactly does
a tutor sound like?

11:50.410 --> 11:51.242
I don't know.

11:51.278 --> 11:52.811
I think he owns
some sort of a diner.

11:52.846 --> 11:53.912
Ok.

11:53.947 --> 11:56.247
He's got two jobs.

11:56.283 --> 11:57.248
He sounds enterprising.

11:57.284 --> 11:58.249
[sighs]

11:58.285 --> 11:59.551
I don't know.

11:59.586 --> 12:00.552
Mom, I don't know.

12:00.587 --> 12:03.088
If Jordan needs more attention
that's my job.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.089
You know?

12:04.124 --> 12:05.323
What do I know about this guy?

12:05.358 --> 12:07.592
I have his number and address,
that's it.

12:07.627 --> 12:10.762
I'm gonna send my kid off
to some stranger?

12:10.797 --> 12:12.297
How about this?

12:12.332 --> 12:14.632
While you're at work tomorrow
I'll stop by his place

12:14.668 --> 12:15.934
and check him out.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.102
Ok?

12:17.137 --> 12:20.939
Sweetheart, you can't keep
Jordan hermetically sealed.

12:20.974 --> 12:22.507
You gotta trust something.

12:22.542 --> 12:23.641
Why?

12:23.677 --> 12:27.078
Honey, what's gotten into you?

12:27.114 --> 12:28.079
I'm sorry.

12:28.115 --> 12:29.180
I'm sorry.

12:29.216 --> 12:32.584
You know, it's just...
Christmas.

12:34.521 --> 12:35.153
It's ok.

12:35.188 --> 12:35.854
I'll call him.

12:35.889 --> 12:38.289
I'll call him again, alright?

12:43.296 --> 12:47.465
<i>Dear God.</i>

12:47.501 --> 12:50.435
<i>How does snow happen?</i>

12:50.470 --> 12:51.669
Two.

12:51.705 --> 12:53.738
<i>Can you read human words?</i>

13:02.415 --> 13:04.015
<i>(Maggie): Jordan...</i>

13:07.254 --> 13:09.053
<i>Baby, where are you?</i>

13:09.089 --> 13:10.522
<i>Jordan!</i>

13:12.692 --> 13:14.793
Hey, little man.

13:14.828 --> 13:16.060
It's time to go to bed.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.562
I don't think so.

13:17.597 --> 13:20.498
Oh, I think you do think so.

13:20.534 --> 13:22.700
But what if time just shifted?

13:22.736 --> 13:24.068
What do you mean?

13:24.104 --> 13:26.704
Like what if something
just happened out there

13:26.740 --> 13:28.740
and it's not the time
they really think it is?

13:28.775 --> 13:31.142
Like Daylight Savings Time?

13:31.178 --> 13:32.510
Yeah, no, not buying it.

13:32.546 --> 13:35.079
Sorry, kiddo.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.414
I need you to get
a good night's sleep

13:36.449 --> 13:37.382
because you and grams

13:37.417 --> 13:39.250
are gonna go on a little
adventure tomorrow.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.219
A fun one or a boring one?

13:41.254 --> 13:43.688
'Cause yesterday she took me
to the grocery store.

13:43.723 --> 13:45.356
Bo-ring.

13:45.392 --> 13:48.159
I can promise you
it's not gonna be boring.

13:48.195 --> 13:50.028
It's gonna be fun.

13:50.063 --> 13:53.832
You're gonna meet somebody new
and if you like him

13:53.867 --> 13:56.568
then we'll talk about it.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.102
Talk about what?

13:58.138 --> 14:01.940
About school and stuff.

14:01.975 --> 14:03.741
That doesn't sound like
an adventure.

14:03.777 --> 14:07.045
In fact, that doesn't even
sound like fun.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.714
Do you know what being too smart
for your own good is?

14:09.749 --> 14:10.782
Hmm?

14:10.817 --> 14:11.950
'Cause that's what you are.

14:11.985 --> 14:12.750
[giggles]

14:12.786 --> 14:13.318
Listen, I'll meet
you upstairs,

14:13.353 --> 14:14.452
I'll tuck you in, ok?

14:14.487 --> 14:15.053
Yeah.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.654
Alright.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.070
<i>Three.</i>

14:32.105 --> 14:38.009
<i>Can you make my mom
like Christmas?</i>

14:47.153 --> 14:49.621
♪ Joy to the world, ♪

14:49.656 --> 14:52.490
♪ The Lord is come, ♪

14:52.525 --> 14:56.661

14:56.696 --> 14:58.062
Hey, guys.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.097
Merry Christmas.

15:03.103 --> 15:03.501
Hey.

15:03.536 --> 15:04.269
Morning, Billy.

15:04.304 --> 15:06.137
Morning, Casey.

15:06.172 --> 15:07.405
What'd you do,
sleep here?

15:07.440 --> 15:09.140
I would if I slept.

15:09.175 --> 15:11.609
I had to re-stock everything
it's been so busy.

15:11.645 --> 15:12.577
You want the usual?

15:12.612 --> 15:13.444
Yeah.

15:13.480 --> 15:14.145
Alright.

15:14.180 --> 15:16.581
Man, I love this time of year.

15:16.616 --> 15:19.284
Maybe we should keep the pop-up
open all year round.

15:19.319 --> 15:21.252
That would kinda defeat
the concept of pop-up,

15:21.288 --> 15:22.654
don't you think?

15:22.689 --> 15:24.322
Besides, Christmas in July?

15:24.357 --> 15:25.156
I'm not so sure.

15:25.191 --> 15:26.591
Hey, Christmas every day
of the year?

15:26.626 --> 15:27.926
That's my kind of a world.

15:27.961 --> 15:30.161
Yeah, that's a lot of work
for us.

15:30.196 --> 15:32.130
Yeah, you're probably right.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.965
Alright, here you go, brother.

15:34.000 --> 15:34.666
Thank you.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.167
Yeah.

15:47.147 --> 15:49.480
Morning, love.

15:49.516 --> 15:52.283
I carry your heart.

16:05.532 --> 16:06.164
Maggie.

16:06.199 --> 16:07.398
Hi Tanner.

16:07.434 --> 16:08.533
Did you get my message?

16:08.568 --> 16:12.403
Uh, yeah, I left you a message
when you were in court.

16:12.439 --> 16:14.072
How did your
settlement hearing go?

16:14.107 --> 16:15.073
Please, no.

16:15.108 --> 16:16.975
You wanna talk
about the law?

16:17.010 --> 16:19.243
I wanna talk about that perfume
you're wearing.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.178
You like it?

16:20.213 --> 16:22.647
Like, a lot.

16:22.682 --> 16:25.016
Well, you should,
because you bought it for me.

16:25.051 --> 16:26.718
I love a generous man.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.319
I should clone me.

16:28.355 --> 16:31.522
Yeah, I think one of you
is probably enough.

16:31.558 --> 16:35.860
Hey, can I take you
for dinner tonight?

16:35.895 --> 16:36.661
Oh, you know what?

16:36.696 --> 16:37.829
My mom is in town.

16:37.864 --> 16:38.997
I can't.

16:39.032 --> 16:40.365
I'll take her, too.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.933
How about the whole family?

16:41.968 --> 16:43.701
It's time I met Jordan,
don't you think?

16:43.737 --> 16:48.206
Uh, how about I call you
after lunch?

16:48.241 --> 16:50.241
Ok. I'll be waiting...

16:57.083 --> 16:58.783
Good idea getting hot chocolate.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.118
Yeah.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.352
Hey, grams?

17:01.388 --> 17:02.587
When you were younger,

17:02.622 --> 17:05.423
did you have electricity or
did you have to light candles?

17:05.458 --> 17:07.525
We had to light candles.

17:07.560 --> 17:10.261
And sometimes it would scare
the dinosaurs.

17:10.296 --> 17:11.229
Yeah, right.

17:11.263 --> 17:11.929
[laughs]

17:11.964 --> 17:13.731
You know I'm just kidding you.

17:13.767 --> 17:17.135
Of course we had electricity.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.569
What do you wanna be
when you grow up?

17:19.606 --> 17:21.638
I'm gonna be an inventor.

17:21.674 --> 17:23.608
Ok, that's a good thing to be.

17:23.643 --> 17:24.541
Like my dad.

17:24.577 --> 17:27.478
Well, your dad isn't exactly
an inventor.

17:27.513 --> 17:28.679
He represents inventors,

17:28.715 --> 17:32.483
like when they need a patent
or they have to sue someone.

17:32.519 --> 17:34.419
He doesn't invent things?

17:34.454 --> 17:35.820
Uh-uh.

17:35.855 --> 17:38.990
So do you think
about your dad often?

17:39.025 --> 17:39.824
I don't know.

17:39.859 --> 17:43.061
I kinda forgot
what he looks like.

17:43.096 --> 17:47.465
You know, let's continue
on our adventure, shall we?

17:47.500 --> 17:48.666
I think we shall.

17:48.701 --> 17:51.069
[laughs]

17:52.038 --> 17:52.437
Thank you.

17:52.472 --> 17:53.538
Jordan, look.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.705
Wow.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.074
Christmas trees!

17:56.109 --> 17:59.077
Hey, wait for me!

17:59.112 --> 18:00.111
Hey.

18:00.146 --> 18:01.179
How're you guys doing?

18:01.214 --> 18:02.246
Good.

18:02.282 --> 18:03.247
Wow.

18:03.283 --> 18:04.348
I got, uh, this big guy here,

18:04.384 --> 18:06.050
I got some more in the back.

18:06.086 --> 18:08.753
You guys are free to take
a look if you like.

18:08.788 --> 18:09.854
They're beautiful.

18:09.889 --> 18:10.421
Yeah.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.356
Absolutely beautiful.

18:23.169 --> 18:24.569
[knocking]

18:24.604 --> 18:25.403
Excuse me, Maggie?

18:25.438 --> 18:26.537
Your 11:00 is here.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.206
Yeah, thank you.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.877
Lauren.

18:32.912 --> 18:36.314
Oh, what's going on?

18:36.349 --> 18:38.382
I need you to represent me.

18:38.418 --> 18:39.484
It's Charlie.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.252
He wants a divorce.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.286
What?

18:42.322 --> 18:44.088
Oh, Lauren.

18:44.124 --> 18:45.389
Come on.

18:45.425 --> 18:46.390
I can't believe it.

18:46.426 --> 18:47.425
Here have a seat.

18:47.460 --> 18:50.461
So, are you sure?

18:50.497 --> 18:52.897
It hasn't been great
for a while.

18:52.932 --> 18:55.900
I'm shocked.

18:55.935 --> 18:58.169
Has he hired a lawyer?

18:58.204 --> 19:00.805
Ok, well I need you
to find out.

19:00.840 --> 19:04.108
I mean, at least that'll let us
know how serious he is.

19:04.144 --> 19:05.309
And if he has someone
on retainer

19:05.345 --> 19:07.745
then I want to know
who it is.

19:07.780 --> 19:10.515
I just can't believe
this is happening.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.817
At Christmas.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.418
Yeah.

19:14.454 --> 19:17.255
I know how that feels.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.357
Does it get better?

19:19.392 --> 19:20.224
No, you know what?

19:20.260 --> 19:22.960
I am not gonna sit here
and lie to you.

19:22.996 --> 19:25.696
Lauren, no, it- it
doesn't get better.

19:25.732 --> 19:28.466
It doesn't get easier.

19:28.501 --> 19:31.869
Sometimes I think the most
dangerous words you can hear

19:31.905 --> 19:36.207
a man say are "I think I'm
falling in love with you".

19:36.242 --> 19:38.976
You know, because then
it's like we let our guard down

19:39.012 --> 19:42.547
and we let hope in and then
we see this perfect happy

19:42.582 --> 19:45.383
little life all laid out
in front of us and...

19:45.418 --> 19:47.652
And ten years later you're
sitting in an attorney's office

19:47.687 --> 19:50.054
asking for help.

19:50.089 --> 19:51.622
Yeah.

19:51.658 --> 19:54.825
Oh, I am sorry.

19:56.062 --> 19:57.461
Thanks for your help, buddy.

19:57.497 --> 19:58.162
No problem.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.730
Alright.

19:59.766 --> 20:00.731
Uh-huh.

20:00.767 --> 20:01.966
Oh you- down this way?

20:02.001 --> 20:03.634
Yes.

20:04.938 --> 20:07.004
It was nice of you to let him
help out.

20:07.040 --> 20:10.841
Jordan's wild about
Christmas trees.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.677
We were more or less
in the neighborhood

20:12.712 --> 20:17.682
so I thought I'd stop in
and get to know you a bit.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.650
My daughter called you
about tutoring the other night.

20:19.686 --> 20:20.685
Oh.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.319
Maggie.

20:21.354 --> 20:22.153
Yes.

20:22.188 --> 20:24.689
I remember, of course.

20:24.724 --> 20:28.426
So you split your time between
tutoring and all of this?

20:28.461 --> 20:31.362
Oh, well this is just a new
thing we're trying this year.

20:31.397 --> 20:34.332
It's a sort of pop-up
Christmas thing.

20:34.367 --> 20:35.366
It's just temporary.

20:35.401 --> 20:37.235
That's a fun idea.

20:37.270 --> 20:41.839
My, uh, wife and I started a
school a number of years ago.

20:41.874 --> 20:42.406
A school?

20:42.442 --> 20:43.274
Yeah.

20:43.309 --> 20:44.141
Up in Vermont.

20:44.177 --> 20:47.078
Some of our neighbors
were quilters.

20:47.113 --> 20:48.546
Oh.

20:52.418 --> 20:56.254
Oh, this is magnificent.

20:56.289 --> 20:58.189
Is that a poem stitched
into it?

20:58.224 --> 21:00.057
Yeah.

21:00.093 --> 21:02.860
"Here is the deepest secret
nobody knows.

21:02.895 --> 21:06.030
"Here is the root of the root,
the bud of the bud,

21:06.065 --> 21:08.232
"and the sky of the sky of
a tree called life.

21:08.268 --> 21:09.734
"I carry your heart.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.570
"I carry it in my heart."

21:12.605 --> 21:14.405
E. E. Cummings.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.274
I can't believe
this hasn't sold.

21:16.309 --> 21:21.345
Oh, uh... no, this was a...
it was a wedding gift.

21:23.683 --> 21:26.217
Anyway, we sold the school
a number of years ago.

21:26.252 --> 21:28.753
I came down here to New York
and started tutoring.

21:28.788 --> 21:31.722
I uh, bought the diner as a way
to make some extra cash.

21:31.758 --> 21:33.758
Still stay flexible.

21:33.793 --> 21:39.297
One thing lead to another and,
well, here we are.

21:39.332 --> 21:40.464
Would you excuse me
for a minute?

21:40.500 --> 21:41.499
Yeah, sure.

21:41.534 --> 21:43.267
Thanks.

21:44.671 --> 21:46.604
<i>Hey, I noticed you back there.</i>

21:47.874 --> 21:48.806
Haha, look at you go.

21:48.841 --> 21:52.610
Yeah, just throw that
right there, Jordan.

21:52.645 --> 21:55.413
Oh, special delivery.

21:55.448 --> 21:57.315
I wonder who here
could help me unload

21:57.350 --> 22:00.651
some of these freshly cut
Christmas trees?

22:00.687 --> 22:01.285
Can I?

22:01.321 --> 22:02.353
I mean, may I?

22:02.388 --> 22:04.355
I mean, please?

22:04.390 --> 22:05.423
Better go ask the boss.

22:05.458 --> 22:06.457
Ok.

22:06.492 --> 22:07.825
Don't slip!

22:09.629 --> 22:10.661
Grams! Grams!

22:10.697 --> 22:12.163
There's a hundred thousand
million trees outside,

22:12.198 --> 22:13.664
can I please help unload them?

22:13.700 --> 22:14.665
Please?

22:14.701 --> 22:17.134
I don't know, you're gonna
have to ask Casey.

22:17.170 --> 22:18.169
Please?

22:18.204 --> 22:20.137
Well, it's- it's ok with me.

22:20.173 --> 22:21.038
It might take a while though,

22:21.074 --> 22:22.506
so I'm happy to watch him
if you want.

22:22.542 --> 22:24.875
It would be a chance for us to get to
know each other a bit better?

22:24.911 --> 22:26.277
Exactly.

22:26.312 --> 22:28.379
Well, maybe I'll go make
some Christmas calls.

22:28.414 --> 22:29.380
I'll be right around
the corner.

22:29.415 --> 22:30.181
Ok.

22:30.216 --> 22:31.048
Yes!

22:31.084 --> 22:34.518
Now make sure you listen
to Casey, ok?

22:39.225 --> 22:40.491
Let's unload some trees.

22:40.526 --> 22:41.192
Let's go.

22:41.227 --> 22:42.693
Let's go.

22:43.329 --> 22:44.328
Alright, big guy.

22:44.364 --> 22:46.163
Here's your first tree.

22:46.199 --> 22:48.132
Put this in the pile
with the firs.

22:48.167 --> 22:49.300
Nice.

22:49.335 --> 22:50.468
Oh, look at you.

22:50.503 --> 22:53.204
Ok, this one's a bit bigger.

22:53.239 --> 22:55.873
Alright, here it comes.

22:55.908 --> 22:57.208
You got it?

22:57.243 --> 22:58.142
Careful.

22:58.177 --> 22:59.777
Oh!

23:00.680 --> 23:02.046
Oh, man.

23:09.522 --> 23:10.488
That was so cool!

23:10.523 --> 23:12.590
I thought I was getting
swallowed by the tree.

23:12.625 --> 23:13.591
Can we do that again?

23:13.626 --> 23:14.959
(Both): No.

23:17.397 --> 23:19.230
Oh...

23:19.265 --> 23:20.931
Hey, did you hurt your arm?

23:20.967 --> 23:22.933
Ah...

23:22.969 --> 23:25.202
Maybe?

23:27.039 --> 23:29.407
Alright, that's enough trees
for today.

23:29.442 --> 23:29.974
Yeah.

23:30.009 --> 23:30.875
Let's get outta here.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.476
Ok.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.582
If there's a fly in a car
that's going 50 miles per hour

23:38.618 --> 23:40.284
is the fly also going 50?

23:40.319 --> 23:43.354
That is an excellent question,
and Galileo asked himself

23:43.389 --> 23:45.022
the exact same thing.

23:45.057 --> 23:47.425
Except, of course,
they didn't have cars.

23:47.460 --> 23:49.393
But when the car just stops
does the fly just run

23:49.429 --> 23:51.228
into the window like BAM?

23:51.264 --> 23:52.530
Exactly.

23:52.565 --> 23:53.330
Bam.

23:53.366 --> 23:54.732
That is the relativity
principle.

23:54.767 --> 23:55.900
But if they didn't have
any cars,

23:55.935 --> 23:56.867
how did they get anywhere?

23:56.903 --> 24:00.805
Well, um... they had horses
and they walked,

24:00.840 --> 24:03.274
and some of them
even rode camels.

24:03.309 --> 24:03.941
Camels?

24:03.976 --> 24:05.242
Mmmhmm.

24:05.278 --> 24:06.544
Hey, baby, are you ok?

24:06.579 --> 24:08.446
I told you, it's just
a little bruise.

24:08.481 --> 24:09.447
Did you know that if there's
a fly inside a car

24:09.482 --> 24:11.215
that's going 50 miles
an hour then the fly-

24:11.250 --> 24:12.550
What- what fly?

24:12.585 --> 24:13.384
The one inside the car.

24:13.419 --> 24:14.285
What car?

24:14.320 --> 24:15.319
You must be Maggie.

24:15.354 --> 24:16.587
He was in a car?

24:16.622 --> 24:19.256
No, we were discussing
Galileo and- hi,

24:19.292 --> 24:20.825
I'm Casey.

24:20.860 --> 24:21.759
Hi.

24:21.794 --> 24:22.927
Are you sure you're ok?

24:22.962 --> 24:24.128
<i>He's fine.</i>

24:24.163 --> 24:25.896
He's fine, it's just
a little bruise.

24:25.932 --> 24:27.898
It was like I was being
swallowed up by Christmas trees.

24:27.934 --> 24:29.467
It was so cool.

24:29.502 --> 24:30.601
What were you doing?

24:30.636 --> 24:31.502
He was a really big help.

24:31.537 --> 24:32.803
We were unloading trees.

24:32.839 --> 24:33.838
Weren't we, bud?

24:33.873 --> 24:35.473
Exactly.

24:35.508 --> 24:39.109
So, you must be Jordan.

24:39.145 --> 24:42.413
I had to drive around
the corner to find parking.

24:42.448 --> 24:49.653
Um... uh, mom, uh, Jordan,
this is Mr. Ryan.

24:49.689 --> 24:51.922
It's nice to finally meet you.

24:51.958 --> 24:54.492
And Jordan, I've been looking
forward to meeting you

24:54.527 --> 24:56.760
for a long time.

24:56.796 --> 24:59.830
Um, nice place.

24:59.866 --> 25:01.499
Tanner Ryan.

25:01.534 --> 25:02.199
You are?

25:02.235 --> 25:03.634
Uh, my friends call me Casey.

25:03.669 --> 25:04.702
Nice to meet you.

25:04.737 --> 25:06.704
Right.

25:06.739 --> 25:08.606
So you fell on your arm, huh?

25:08.641 --> 25:12.042
Your mom was real worried.

25:12.078 --> 25:13.177
No, I'm good.

25:13.212 --> 25:15.880
Well, I am famished.

25:15.915 --> 25:18.148
Can you recommend a good place
for us for dinner?

25:18.184 --> 25:21.185
Um, there's a great Italian
restaurant just down the way.

25:21.220 --> 25:22.620
Who's hungry?

25:22.655 --> 25:24.955
Come on, baby.

25:26.993 --> 25:28.359
Bye.

25:29.161 --> 25:30.361
See ya.

25:30.396 --> 25:31.529
Bye.

25:35.001 --> 25:36.634
Those are pretty cool, huh?

25:36.669 --> 25:37.301
Yeah.

25:37.336 --> 25:40.170
Hand made by a local artist.

25:40.206 --> 25:44.041
That one's my favorite.

25:44.076 --> 25:45.843
Jordan, baby, come on.

25:45.878 --> 25:46.410
We're all waiting on you.

25:46.445 --> 25:47.311
Ok.

25:47.346 --> 25:48.312
It's freezing out there.

25:48.347 --> 25:50.180
Yeah.

25:51.083 --> 25:51.582
Bye.

25:51.617 --> 25:52.416
Have a good dinner.

25:52.451 --> 25:53.951
Bye.

26:11.537 --> 26:15.639
<i>I mean, so much for fiduciary
responsibility, right?</i>

26:15.675 --> 26:17.207
So then I ask him,
how do you say

26:17.243 --> 26:18.842
"see you in court"
in Mandarin?

26:18.878 --> 26:22.313
[laughs]

26:34.427 --> 26:38.495
Uh, it was really nice of you
to take us all out, Tanner.

26:38.531 --> 26:39.997
Well, what can I say?

26:40.032 --> 26:41.832
My mother raised a gentleman.

26:41.867 --> 26:43.801
Yes, she did.

26:43.836 --> 26:45.035
Thank you.

26:45.071 --> 26:46.904
I thought it went pretty well.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.038
Meeting Jordan and all.

26:48.074 --> 26:51.709
Yeah... I just feel like he was
a little quiet tonight.

26:51.744 --> 26:52.476
Ah.

26:52.511 --> 26:55.045
Kids get over that.

26:55.081 --> 26:56.747
Your mom's a hoot.

26:56.782 --> 26:57.748
[laughs]
Yeah.

26:57.783 --> 26:59.650
It was fun.

26:59.685 --> 27:01.352
The whole night.

27:01.387 --> 27:06.256
Very generous of you,
per usual.

27:06.292 --> 27:07.825
Maggie?

27:07.860 --> 27:11.228
Early Christmas wish.

27:11.263 --> 27:14.565
I wanna spend as much time
with you as possible.

27:16.802 --> 27:17.768
What?

27:17.803 --> 27:21.438
That's a good wish, right?

27:21.474 --> 27:23.407
Yeah.

27:28.414 --> 27:30.581
Goodnight, Tanner.

27:30.616 --> 27:32.683
Goodnight.

27:39.425 --> 27:41.425
[sighs]

27:44.063 --> 27:46.697
I didn't know you
were seeing someone.

27:46.732 --> 27:50.234
No, it's... it's not really
public yet.

27:50.269 --> 27:51.535
What, and I'm the public?

27:51.570 --> 27:52.169
No.

27:52.204 --> 27:53.704
Honey, you can talk to me.

27:53.739 --> 27:54.772
That's not what I meant,
mom.

27:54.807 --> 27:56.640
I just- I just mean-
I don't-

27:56.676 --> 27:57.908
I don't know how I feel,
you know?

27:57.943 --> 28:01.078
In fact, I don't even know how
I'm supposed to feel anymore.

28:01.113 --> 28:03.213
It's been so long.

28:03.249 --> 28:06.417
Well, Tanner seems like
a lovely man.

28:06.452 --> 28:11.388
He's handsome, confident,
and uh, he certainly

28:11.424 --> 28:12.089
understands your world.

28:12.124 --> 28:15.626
No, I know, I know, he's great.

28:15.661 --> 28:17.294
It's just... I don't know.

28:17.329 --> 28:21.965
It's more like we work in
the same building, you know?

28:22.001 --> 28:25.302
Maybe it's out of convenience.

28:25.337 --> 28:26.670
I don't know.

28:26.706 --> 28:29.073
Maybe I'm just gun shy.

28:29.108 --> 28:32.276
Honey, you don't wanna live
the rest of your life alone.

28:32.311 --> 28:35.345
I mean, you get back
in the saddle.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.748
You didn't after dad left.

28:37.783 --> 28:38.749
Honey, that's different.

28:38.784 --> 28:39.550
How?

28:39.585 --> 28:40.984
Well, we're not talking
about me.

28:41.020 --> 28:45.189
You, on the other hand,
can find love again.

28:45.224 --> 28:46.356
You can be happy.

28:46.392 --> 28:48.859
You know, mom.

28:48.894 --> 28:51.628
To be completely honest
with you,

28:51.664 --> 28:55.432
the last time I was really happy
was when I was 13 years old,

28:55.468 --> 28:58.001
and I remember it like
it was yesterday.

28:58.037 --> 29:00.637
It was when we were in Tahoe
and I got my first kiss

29:00.673 --> 29:07.511
from that sweet boy
who gave me his glove.

29:07.546 --> 29:09.880
I was really happy.

29:09.915 --> 29:12.549
You know, I remember what that
felt like in my heart and it-

29:12.585 --> 29:15.385
and it was real.

29:15.421 --> 29:19.022
And I remember thinking
to myself...

29:19.058 --> 29:21.125
maybe this is what love is,
you know?

29:21.160 --> 29:24.495
Maybe this is
what it feels like.

29:24.530 --> 29:26.296
Do you know I still remember
his name?

29:26.332 --> 29:26.964
Really?

29:26.999 --> 29:27.698
Yes, I do.

29:27.733 --> 29:28.799
His name was Kade.

29:28.834 --> 29:29.733
Kade.

29:29.769 --> 29:30.701
Yeah.

29:30.736 --> 29:35.606
I don't know how or why I do
but I... I do.

29:38.611 --> 29:45.249
And then dad left
that Christmas Eve.

29:45.284 --> 29:52.356
And Randall left three years
ago, a week before Christmas.

29:52.391 --> 29:55.826
And I spend every single day of
my life dealing with sad people

29:55.861 --> 30:00.531
who's romantic vows have just
blown up in their face.

30:00.566 --> 30:01.665
Maggie, it's-

30:01.700 --> 30:02.599
And you know what?

30:02.635 --> 30:04.501
Listen, mom, it's not just
about me, ok?

30:04.537 --> 30:05.869
It's about Jordan, too.

30:05.905 --> 30:07.938
I can't let him go through
that again.

30:07.973 --> 30:09.139
I'm- I'm fine, you know?

30:09.175 --> 30:12.242
I can deal with it but I'm not
gonna put that on my boy.

30:12.278 --> 30:15.412
Not again.

30:15.447 --> 30:18.782
Well, just don't close
yourself off is all I'm asking.

30:18.818 --> 30:21.451
You're still young.

30:21.487 --> 30:24.254
Were you always obsessive
with the folding?

30:24.290 --> 30:25.789
Rolling?

30:25.825 --> 30:27.124
Whatever that is?

30:27.159 --> 30:28.458
What?

30:28.494 --> 30:30.460
I have a system, it works,

30:30.496 --> 30:33.764
which you are clearly
not following.

30:33.799 --> 30:35.899
I didn't know you were such
a control freak.

30:35.935 --> 30:39.403
I'm not a con- it-
it's just- it...

30:39.438 --> 30:40.804
they don't wrinkle like this.

30:40.840 --> 30:42.806
Ok.

30:42.842 --> 30:45.442
I'm not a control--.

31:05.831 --> 31:11.001
<i>God, are all moms sad
all the time?</i>

31:11.036 --> 31:15.272
<i>She pretends she's not,
but I know she is.</i>

31:15.307 --> 31:17.674
<i>And what's the difference
between being mad</i>

31:17.710 --> 31:20.277
<i>and being worried?</i>

31:20.312 --> 31:25.048
<i>God, for Christmas, can you
make my mom happy?</i>

31:39.398 --> 31:41.031
Did you make your bed?

31:41.066 --> 31:41.598
Mmmhmm.

31:41.634 --> 31:42.432
Good.

31:42.468 --> 31:44.134
Thank you.

31:44.169 --> 31:46.503
You and Grams
are going out today.

31:46.538 --> 31:47.137
Yeah.

31:47.172 --> 31:47.938
We're going to the museum.

31:47.973 --> 31:49.139
I know.

31:49.174 --> 31:49.773
I know.

31:49.808 --> 31:50.841
Did you charge your phone?

31:50.876 --> 31:53.110
Mmmhmm.

31:53.145 --> 31:57.214
Mom, is Casey gonna be
my tutor?

31:57.249 --> 31:58.515
What?

31:58.550 --> 32:00.284
I heard you and Grams talking.

32:00.319 --> 32:01.118
Gotcha!

32:01.153 --> 32:03.287
[laughs]

32:03.322 --> 32:04.454
Morning, sweetheart.

32:04.490 --> 32:05.555
Morning.

32:05.591 --> 32:06.523
Morning, mom.

32:06.558 --> 32:07.491
Here's the coffee.

32:07.526 --> 32:09.059
Thank you.

32:09.094 --> 32:11.061
Grams, is Casey gonna be
my tutor?

32:11.096 --> 32:12.396
Hey, eat your food.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.564
Well, do you want him to be?

32:14.600 --> 32:16.967
He seems like a nice guy.

32:17.002 --> 32:18.535
Yeah, I liked him.

32:18.570 --> 32:18.969
A lot.

32:19.004 --> 32:19.903
He likes him.

32:19.939 --> 32:22.139
Yeah, but I don't know anything
about him.

32:22.174 --> 32:24.541
Well, he and his wife
are educators,

32:24.576 --> 32:26.143
they ran a school in Vermont,

32:26.178 --> 32:28.879
and he comes highly recommended
by Jordan's teacher.

32:28.914 --> 32:31.248
Obviously he's responsible.

32:31.283 --> 32:34.017
Oh, he's obviously responsible?

32:34.053 --> 32:37.254
Ten minutes alone with my
son and he's already injured.

32:37.289 --> 32:38.121
You're being so dramatic.

32:38.157 --> 32:40.090
Jordan was just doing
what kids do.

32:40.125 --> 32:41.158
Yeah.

32:41.193 --> 32:42.225
Please, mom?

32:42.261 --> 32:48.165
I mean, how often does a kid
beg to have a tutor?

32:48.200 --> 32:52.102
You guys are ganging up
on me.

32:52.137 --> 32:54.938
Alright, I'll think about it.

32:54.974 --> 32:55.605
Yay.

32:55.641 --> 32:56.740
No yay, ok?

32:56.775 --> 32:59.009
I said I'd think about it.

32:59.044 --> 33:00.777
I'm gonna leave you all these
dishes, ok?

33:00.813 --> 33:02.346
Yep.

33:05.784 --> 33:07.551
[laughs]

33:12.291 --> 33:13.156
ho.

33:13.192 --> 33:14.324
Hey.

33:14.360 --> 33:15.225
Hey.

33:15.260 --> 33:15.859
Thanks for lugging
that thing up here.

33:15.894 --> 33:18.929
You're doing me a favor.

33:18.964 --> 33:20.998
Nobody but you would want
this pitiful thing.

33:21.033 --> 33:22.432
Look at this thing.

33:22.468 --> 33:23.533
Pitiful?

33:23.569 --> 33:25.035
Don't you listen to him.

33:25.070 --> 33:29.940
You are beautiful and unique.

33:29.975 --> 33:31.375
Talking to trees now?

33:31.410 --> 33:33.377
That's not good.

33:33.412 --> 33:34.444
[phone ringing]

33:34.480 --> 33:34.878
Uh, you got this?

33:34.913 --> 33:35.612
Yeah, I got it.

33:35.647 --> 33:36.179
Go ahead.

33:36.215 --> 33:37.781
Hello, this is Casey.

33:37.816 --> 33:39.216
Hi, Casey.

33:39.251 --> 33:40.784
This is Maggie again.

33:40.819 --> 33:43.220
Is it a good time to talk now?

33:43.255 --> 33:44.054
Oh, yeah.

33:44.089 --> 33:45.522
This is a great time.

33:45.557 --> 33:47.357
Listen, I want to apologize
again for alarming you

33:47.393 --> 33:48.592
the other night.

33:48.627 --> 33:51.128
That's ok. He's doing
better now.

33:51.163 --> 33:52.562
<i>Good.</i>

33:52.598 --> 33:53.797
<i>I'm glad to hear that.</i>

33:53.832 --> 33:56.800
Actually, I was just calling
to see if we could find a time

33:56.835 --> 33:59.302
to meet up to talk
about tutoring Jordan?

33:59.338 --> 34:00.404
Oh, yeah.

34:00.439 --> 34:01.438
Of course.

34:01.473 --> 34:02.939
When's a good time
to meet?

34:02.975 --> 34:04.975
3:30 tomorrow?

34:05.010 --> 34:06.810
Uh, unfortunately
I can't meet

34:06.845 --> 34:09.079
during the day though,
I'm sorry.

34:09.114 --> 34:12.482
Oh, uh... why don't you come
over for dinner?

34:12.518 --> 34:13.083
7:30.

34:13.118 --> 34:15.619
I'll cook.

34:15.654 --> 34:16.652
Yeah.

34:16.688 --> 34:18.388
Yeah, that actually-

34:18.424 --> 34:19.656
that works fine.

34:19.690 --> 34:20.590
Are you sure?

34:20.626 --> 34:21.391
Yeah, of course.

34:21.427 --> 34:22.659
It's no big deal at all.

34:22.694 --> 34:24.261
Ok.

34:24.295 --> 34:25.762
Alright, I'll see you then.

34:25.797 --> 34:26.730
I'll text you my address.

34:26.764 --> 34:27.496
Ok.

34:27.533 --> 34:29.065
Bye.

34:30.936 --> 34:33.235
So you invited her over
for dinner?

34:33.272 --> 34:34.471
Yeah.

34:34.505 --> 34:37.074
You know, she works all day
and restaurants are so noisy,

34:37.109 --> 34:38.341
so I thought I'd cook.

34:38.377 --> 34:39.376
Yeah.

34:39.411 --> 34:41.678
I guess you're making some
of that fancy pasta

34:41.713 --> 34:42.813
Yeah, maybe.

34:42.848 --> 34:43.847
Mmmhmm.

34:43.882 --> 34:45.649
So in that case, can I come too?

34:45.684 --> 34:46.616
No, you cannot.

34:46.652 --> 34:48.085
[laughs]

34:48.120 --> 34:48.685
That's what I thought.

34:48.719 --> 34:49.518
You got this?

34:49.554 --> 34:50.020
I got it.

34:50.054 --> 34:50.587
Alright.

34:50.621 --> 34:51.588
Thanks for your help.

34:51.623 --> 34:52.956
Yeah, man.

34:58.230 --> 35:00.263
[knocking]

35:05.370 --> 35:05.869
Hi.

35:05.904 --> 35:06.536
Hi.

35:06.572 --> 35:07.304
Come on in.

35:07.339 --> 35:08.772
Thank you.

35:08.807 --> 35:11.041
Excuse the mess, I'd say
it isn't always like this

35:11.076 --> 35:13.276
but that would be
a momentous lie.

35:13.312 --> 35:15.712
Make yourself at home.

35:15.747 --> 35:19.282
I've just got something
in the oven.

35:19.318 --> 35:22.319
Wow, it smells amazing
in here.

35:22.354 --> 35:24.855
Oh, come on.

35:24.890 --> 35:26.690
You didn't have to go through
all this trouble.

35:26.725 --> 35:28.525
Oh, no trouble at all.

35:28.560 --> 35:29.726
It's what I do.

35:29.761 --> 35:30.627
Here, sit.

35:30.662 --> 35:32.229
Thanks.

35:32.264 --> 35:34.331
Do you chop?

35:34.366 --> 35:36.566
Well, I can chop my way through
a take-out container,

35:36.602 --> 35:37.667
does that help?

35:37.703 --> 35:38.869
What're you making?

35:38.904 --> 35:41.037
Ah, pasta caponata.

35:41.073 --> 35:43.907
It's my mother-in-law's
speciality.

35:43.942 --> 35:47.043
How do you feel about spice?

35:47.079 --> 35:48.545
What about that question
makes me think

35:48.580 --> 35:50.313
it's a character test?

35:50.349 --> 35:51.181
Here.

35:51.216 --> 35:52.716
Have a taste.

35:58.390 --> 35:59.723
Mmm.

35:59.758 --> 36:01.491
Just a little more spice
and you got it.

36:01.527 --> 36:02.425
A little more spice.

36:02.461 --> 36:04.294
It's really good.

36:05.063 --> 36:06.830
How do you think children learn?

36:06.865 --> 36:09.232
Well, I think most kids
are natural learners.

36:09.268 --> 36:10.600
They're too...

36:10.636 --> 36:12.035
they're too independent
to be told what to do.

36:12.070 --> 36:13.570
I mean, sit down, stay still,

36:13.605 --> 36:15.105
learn your multiplication
tables?

36:15.140 --> 36:16.406
It's boring.

36:16.441 --> 36:17.040
Yeah.

36:17.075 --> 36:18.742
They know it, we know it.

36:18.777 --> 36:21.711
The way I teach is more organic.

36:21.747 --> 36:22.579
I like that.

36:22.614 --> 36:24.514
And by the way,
whatever you're doing,

36:24.550 --> 36:26.183
it's working because Jordan
is still talking about

36:26.218 --> 36:28.685
the fly inside the car.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.687
The relativity principle.

36:30.722 --> 36:31.888
He's a good kid.

36:31.924 --> 36:34.457
Yeah, he is.

36:34.493 --> 36:37.394
So I would love for you
to start working with him

36:37.429 --> 36:39.796
if you could, maybe over
the Christmas break?

36:39.831 --> 36:41.398
Absolutely.

36:41.433 --> 36:43.934
But it is the busiest time
of the year for us so as long

36:43.969 --> 36:47.370
as you are cool with him just
hanging out with me there?

36:47.406 --> 36:49.239
I mean, making change
is a great way for him

36:49.274 --> 36:50.473
to learn math skills.

36:50.509 --> 36:51.441
Yeah.

36:51.476 --> 36:52.309
Yeah, I'm ok with that.

36:52.344 --> 36:54.077
Great.

36:54.112 --> 36:55.478
Um, and what
about your wife?

36:55.514 --> 36:58.648
Will she be working with him
as well?

36:58.684 --> 37:03.820
Uh, my wife, Amy, passed away
three years ago.

37:03.855 --> 37:05.088
She had cancer.

37:05.123 --> 37:06.756
Oh.

37:06.792 --> 37:07.824
I'm um...

37:07.859 --> 37:09.626
I'm sorry.

37:09.661 --> 37:11.895
That's ok.

37:11.930 --> 37:15.832
Life doesn't always follow
a guide book.

37:15.867 --> 37:17.801
But the heart heals, right?

37:17.836 --> 37:21.638
If it didn't we'd never make it
past the age of 13

37:21.673 --> 37:26.509
or whatever age it is that
we first have our hearts broken.

37:26.545 --> 37:28.411
We move on.

37:34.886 --> 37:36.453
So do you have your phone?

37:36.488 --> 37:37.020
Yeah.

37:37.055 --> 37:38.121
And it's all charged?

37:38.156 --> 37:39.022
Mmmhmm.

37:39.057 --> 37:40.290
Casey's waiting for me.

37:40.325 --> 37:41.258
Ok, go on.

37:41.293 --> 37:44.761
But your mom's picking you up
at 3:00, ok?

37:44.796 --> 37:45.695
Hey, Jordan.

37:45.731 --> 37:46.763
Yeah?

37:46.798 --> 37:47.430
Be good.

37:47.466 --> 37:49.332
Why do you always say that?

37:49.368 --> 37:51.768
Because if I told you in
the middle of all these people

37:51.803 --> 37:53.803
that I love you, you'd get
all embarrassed.

37:53.839 --> 37:54.471
Grams.

37:54.506 --> 37:55.372
[laughs]

37:55.407 --> 37:56.706
I knew it.

37:56.742 --> 37:58.808
Hey, Billy.

37:58.844 --> 37:59.309
Hi.

37:59.344 --> 38:00.310
Hey.

38:00.345 --> 38:01.144
What's goin' on, man?

38:01.179 --> 38:01.778
You good?

38:01.813 --> 38:03.847
Yeah.

38:03.882 --> 38:05.982
You're in good hands.

38:06.018 --> 38:06.816
Yeah.

38:06.852 --> 38:07.617
You ready to work?

38:07.653 --> 38:08.318
Yeah.

38:08.353 --> 38:09.586
That's my man.

38:15.360 --> 38:16.960
Ok, you ready to do
some work?

38:16.995 --> 38:17.627
Mmmhmm.

38:17.663 --> 38:19.663
I need to do some inventory,

38:19.698 --> 38:22.666
so I gotta figure out how many
ornaments I've got.

38:22.701 --> 38:25.368
So in each box you count out
the number of ornaments

38:25.404 --> 38:27.070
and then we multiply
that number

38:27.105 --> 38:29.706
by the number of boxes
for each unit.

38:29.741 --> 38:30.173
Ok.

38:30.208 --> 38:31.574
Ok.

38:31.610 --> 38:34.144
One, two, three, four.

38:34.179 --> 38:36.079
Hey, Casey?

38:36.114 --> 38:37.380
Uh-huh?

38:37.416 --> 38:39.482
Does God read human words?

38:39.518 --> 38:40.984
What's that?

38:41.019 --> 38:42.152
Like, human words.

38:42.187 --> 38:43.753
Like prayer?

38:43.789 --> 38:45.255
No, like if someone wrote him
a letter.

38:45.290 --> 38:47.490
Would he be able
to understand it?

38:47.526 --> 38:50.660
God would understand.

38:50.696 --> 38:52.028
How many?

38:52.064 --> 38:53.730
Uh, 27.

38:53.765 --> 38:56.199
Hmm, you sure?

38:56.234 --> 38:57.367
28.

38:57.402 --> 38:58.568
There you go.

38:58.603 --> 39:04.708
Oh, well, in letters then,
is it Mr. God or Dear God or...

39:04.743 --> 39:05.608
You know what?

39:05.644 --> 39:07.444
I don't think God
is that particular.

39:07.479 --> 39:09.012
God must get a lot of letters.

39:09.047 --> 39:11.348
Oh yeah.

39:11.383 --> 39:14.517
Uh, 16 here, plus 28, 44.

39:14.553 --> 39:16.753
Very good.

39:16.788 --> 39:19.222
Well, how do you know he reads
all of them?

39:19.257 --> 39:21.124
How do you know he doesn't
lose some?

39:21.159 --> 39:22.792
You just know.

39:22.828 --> 39:24.794
That's what faith is.

39:24.830 --> 39:26.296
I guess so.

39:26.331 --> 39:27.297
Yeah.

39:27.332 --> 39:28.298
Time for threes.

39:28.333 --> 39:30.200
Time for threes.

39:30.235 --> 39:34.804
One, two, three...

39:34.840 --> 39:37.707
Sorry about this, I wanted
to have a real lunch

39:37.743 --> 39:39.909
but my schedule got
all squeezed together

39:39.945 --> 39:42.312
and I have to pick up Jordan
at 3:00.

39:42.347 --> 39:43.446
Thank you, Martha.

39:43.482 --> 39:44.180
Yeah.

39:44.216 --> 39:45.248
Did I tell you I got him
a tutor?

39:45.283 --> 39:45.815
Hmm.

39:45.851 --> 39:46.783
Yeah.

39:46.818 --> 39:47.884
Oh, is this ok?

39:47.919 --> 39:48.818
Fine.

39:48.854 --> 39:51.388
It's- it's all fine.

39:51.423 --> 39:55.091
I'm trying not to sweat
the small stuff.

39:55.127 --> 39:57.794
That way I can save my energy
for my life.

39:57.829 --> 39:59.095
It is falling apart.

39:59.131 --> 39:59.929
Oh, come on.

39:59.965 --> 40:02.065
Your life's not gonna
fall apart.

40:02.100 --> 40:03.833
You have me!

40:03.869 --> 40:06.770
By the way, did you find out
if Charlie engaged a lawyer?

40:06.805 --> 40:07.637
He has.

40:07.672 --> 40:08.204
Yeah?

40:08.240 --> 40:09.606
Did you find out who?

40:09.641 --> 40:12.242
I just got a name,
that's all.

40:12.277 --> 40:13.443
Ryan.

40:13.478 --> 40:16.012
Tanner Ryan.

40:16.047 --> 40:18.081
He hired Tanner?

40:18.116 --> 40:22.452
What does that mean?

40:22.487 --> 40:25.188
That means scorched earth.

40:29.828 --> 40:31.361
Maggie, I work at a law firm.

40:31.396 --> 40:32.162
I take clients on.

40:32.197 --> 40:33.496
Oh, come on, Tanner.

40:33.532 --> 40:35.632
You don't have to take
every single client.

40:35.667 --> 40:37.367
And you knew his wife was
my friend.

40:37.402 --> 40:38.768
And you're gonna represent her?

40:38.804 --> 40:40.770
Against you?

40:40.806 --> 40:41.771
I know how you fight.

40:41.807 --> 40:43.873
You're going to have them
hating each other

40:43.909 --> 40:46.543
and you're just going to drag it
out forever.

40:46.578 --> 40:51.047
Think of the billable hours.

40:51.082 --> 40:52.649
Billable hours?

40:52.684 --> 40:54.551
Tanner, these are people.

40:54.586 --> 40:56.453
They have kids.

40:56.488 --> 40:56.886
I'm sorry.

40:56.922 --> 40:57.887
I was joking.

40:57.923 --> 40:59.222
Not funny.

40:59.257 --> 41:00.056
Come on.

41:00.091 --> 41:01.157
You're the toughest attorney
I know.

41:01.193 --> 41:03.693
I don't know why you're being
so sentimental here.

41:03.728 --> 41:05.462
Think of how many divorces
you've handled.

41:05.497 --> 41:06.563
This isn't personal here.

41:06.598 --> 41:07.964
This is just business.

41:07.999 --> 41:12.635
Tanner, these are people.

41:12.671 --> 41:16.606
They're not billable hours.

41:29.287 --> 41:32.522
Sometimes I wish I could live
just right there

41:32.557 --> 41:40.497
inside this little dome where
everything is safe and quiet.

41:40.532 --> 41:44.234
Oh, thank you.

41:44.269 --> 41:48.538
These are wonderful.

41:48.573 --> 41:49.405
What does this one say?

41:49.441 --> 41:51.741
"Merry Christmas
from the North Pole".

41:51.776 --> 41:54.410
That's a good one.

41:54.446 --> 41:55.745
Collecting these things
for years.

41:55.780 --> 41:56.846
Yeah?

41:56.882 --> 41:58.114
You're right.

41:58.149 --> 42:00.783
There's something about how the
whole universe is just frozen

42:00.819 --> 42:02.185
in a globe.

42:02.220 --> 42:03.953
Hmm.

42:03.989 --> 42:06.122
You know, the first thing I ever
bought was a snow globe.

42:06.157 --> 42:07.090
Really?

42:07.125 --> 42:08.057
I still have it.

42:08.093 --> 42:08.625
You do?

42:08.660 --> 42:09.325
Yeah.

42:09.361 --> 42:10.627
Is it- it's not one of these?

42:10.662 --> 42:12.462
No, it's at home in a box.

42:12.497 --> 42:13.730
Too special.

42:13.765 --> 42:14.764
Mmm.

42:17.335 --> 42:19.135
Hey, thank you.

42:19.170 --> 42:20.069
For what?

42:20.105 --> 42:21.304
For Jordan.

42:21.339 --> 42:23.740
You know, in just a few days
you have made such a difference

42:23.775 --> 42:25.208
with that kid.

42:25.243 --> 42:27.977
He's talking about percentages.

42:28.013 --> 42:28.778
He's a good kid.

42:28.813 --> 42:31.314
And he's asking me
about Galileo.

42:31.349 --> 42:33.550
I don't know anything
about Galileo.

42:33.585 --> 42:34.651
What is it, gravity?

42:34.686 --> 42:36.386
No, not gravity.

42:36.421 --> 42:37.320
That's Newton.

42:37.355 --> 42:38.254
See?

42:38.290 --> 42:39.155
See?

42:39.190 --> 42:40.089
That's why he needs you.

42:40.125 --> 42:41.090
Not me.

42:41.126 --> 42:41.925
[bell rings]

42:41.960 --> 42:42.725
Woah.

42:42.761 --> 42:44.761
I don't wanna go back
out there.

42:44.796 --> 42:46.262
We might go back out to do
a couple more trees.

42:46.298 --> 42:47.330
Let's go.

42:47.365 --> 42:47.897
Ok.

42:47.933 --> 42:50.433
What?

42:50.468 --> 42:51.935
Would you be interested
in joining me

42:51.970 --> 42:54.604
on the Christmas stroll?

42:54.639 --> 42:56.239
Christmas stroll?

42:56.274 --> 42:58.608
Yeah, it's an annual thing
we do here on Main Street.

42:58.643 --> 43:03.079
All the shops shut down
and people stroll.

43:03.114 --> 43:07.850
We hand out cocoa and cider
and Jordan asked me

43:07.886 --> 43:10.420
if I would ask you to come.

43:10.455 --> 43:11.988
Mmm.

43:12.023 --> 43:12.689
What's that?

43:12.724 --> 43:13.690
Yeah.

43:13.725 --> 43:15.792
Yeah, that kid.

43:15.827 --> 43:17.961
He knows how to get
what he wants.

43:17.996 --> 43:19.195
Well, I mean, it's a lot of fun.

43:19.230 --> 43:22.131
There's lights and
Christmas music.

43:22.167 --> 43:24.667
Yeah, we just...

43:24.703 --> 43:27.470
we don't really make
that big a deal of Christmas.

43:27.505 --> 43:30.206
Because?

43:30.241 --> 43:33.509
It's complicated.

43:33.545 --> 43:35.211
Ok.

43:35.246 --> 43:40.817
Well, it doesn't have to be
a Christmas stroll, it can be...

43:40.852 --> 43:41.951
exercise.

43:41.987 --> 43:44.153
Exercise?

43:44.189 --> 43:45.121
And no caroling.

43:45.156 --> 43:45.722
No.

43:45.757 --> 43:46.723
No caroling.

43:46.758 --> 43:48.324
Mmm-mmm.

43:48.360 --> 43:49.125
Alright.

43:49.160 --> 43:49.959
Deal. I'm in.

43:49.995 --> 43:50.760
[clink]

43:50.795 --> 43:51.561
And I'll teach you
about Galileo.

43:51.596 --> 43:52.462
Oh, yes.

43:52.497 --> 43:53.129
Mmmhmm.

43:53.164 --> 43:54.297
I was hoping you'd say that.

43:54.332 --> 43:55.531
Mmmhmm.

44:03.575 --> 44:05.908
Ok, so he was a father
of science.

44:05.944 --> 44:07.010
Yep.

44:07.045 --> 44:09.412
He was also the father
of observational astronomy.

44:09.447 --> 44:10.480
Thank you.

44:10.515 --> 44:11.347
And physics.

44:11.383 --> 44:13.516
Galileo got around, huh?

44:13.551 --> 44:15.985
Yeah, he wrote about mathematics
and engineering.

44:16.021 --> 44:17.520
He invented the thermoscope,

44:17.555 --> 44:19.389
and he wrote about
your favorite topic,

44:19.424 --> 44:21.024
the relativity principle.

44:21.059 --> 44:23.059
Ah, the fly inside the car.

44:23.094 --> 44:23.926
See?

44:23.962 --> 44:25.161
I was listening.

44:25.196 --> 44:28.598
Yes, he discovered Jupiter's
satellites and Saturn's rings

44:28.633 --> 44:30.767
and he wrote about the
heliocentric universe,

44:30.802 --> 44:34.203
which is the idea that the earth
rotates around the sun

44:34.239 --> 44:36.205
and not the other way around.

44:36.241 --> 44:38.207
It's crazy, I never knew
any of this.

44:38.243 --> 44:40.710
And for our next lesson
I will teach you all about

44:40.745 --> 44:41.944
Isaac Newton.

44:41.980 --> 44:42.745
Oh.

44:42.781 --> 44:45.081
And what might I ask,
dear sir,

44:45.116 --> 44:47.950
do I owe for all of these
private lessons?

44:47.986 --> 44:50.186
Hmm.

44:50.221 --> 44:51.120
A home-cooked meal.

44:51.156 --> 44:53.890
[laughs]

44:53.925 --> 44:55.858
Oh, are you serious?

44:55.894 --> 44:57.226
Well, how bad is your cooking?

44:57.262 --> 44:59.295
It's bad.

44:59.330 --> 45:00.296
Gosh.

45:00.331 --> 45:01.397
I don't wanna get sick.

45:01.433 --> 45:02.231
Oh, stop it.

45:02.267 --> 45:06.102
It's not that bad.

45:06.137 --> 45:07.570
Hey, look.

45:09.340 --> 45:12.075
Awe.

45:12.110 --> 45:16.045
Yeah. I like it. I like it.

45:16.081 --> 45:17.246
So sweet.

45:17.282 --> 45:21.617
So the Christmas stroll wasn't
that bad of an idea, huh?

45:21.653 --> 45:26.389
Yeah, not that bad of an idea.

45:26.424 --> 45:30.560
So... dinner, your place?

45:30.595 --> 45:33.096
Yes?

45:33.131 --> 45:36.632
You're a brave man.

45:36.668 --> 45:39.402
Brave man, Mr. Cummins.

45:40.472 --> 45:42.805
Uh, no.

45:42.841 --> 45:45.675
It's around here somewhere,
I just uh...

45:45.710 --> 45:47.643
definitely not there.

45:47.679 --> 45:51.948
Uh, I don't- I don't really cook
that much- excuse me.

45:51.983 --> 45:53.082
I don't cook at all.

45:53.118 --> 45:56.018
Um... ah.

45:56.054 --> 45:57.086
There we go.

45:57.122 --> 45:59.489
Sauce pan.

45:59.524 --> 46:03.359
Ok, this is a sauté pan.

46:03.394 --> 46:07.296
A sauce pan is um...
excuse me.

46:07.332 --> 46:08.965
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

46:09.000 --> 46:13.503
Right... this is a sauce pan.

46:13.538 --> 46:14.604
They look exactly alike.

46:14.639 --> 46:15.772
What's the difference?

46:15.807 --> 46:17.306
Wow, you are a disaster.

46:17.342 --> 46:18.808
'Cause you don't know
the difference.

46:18.843 --> 46:20.042
I know the difference.

46:20.078 --> 46:23.179
Oh, and this foreign object,
my friend, is called a knife.

46:23.214 --> 46:24.814
I know what a knife is.

46:24.849 --> 46:30.620
Ok then you can mince this
for me.

46:30.655 --> 46:31.220
Of course, yeah.

46:31.256 --> 46:32.321
I can do that.

46:32.357 --> 46:32.955
Excuse me.

46:32.991 --> 46:34.457
Yeah.

46:43.601 --> 46:44.400
What?

46:44.435 --> 46:45.201
No, take your time.

46:45.236 --> 46:47.336
We can eat next week.

46:47.372 --> 46:49.839
Well, if you keep that up
you're not gonna eat at all.

46:49.874 --> 46:50.973
You stay right there.

46:51.009 --> 46:53.242
I got this.

46:53.278 --> 46:55.645
I know how to mince.

46:58.550 --> 47:00.483
I don't know why law school.

47:00.518 --> 47:03.186
I guess it just seemed like
a good idea at the time.

47:03.221 --> 47:04.854
[laughs]

47:04.889 --> 47:08.925
You know, I wanted to believe
that things made sense,

47:08.960 --> 47:09.992
you know?

47:10.028 --> 47:12.361
And that laws created
some sort of order in life

47:12.397 --> 47:14.831
and that if you could understand
the laws

47:14.866 --> 47:17.733
then you could understand
human nature.

47:17.769 --> 47:19.168
How's that working out
for you?

47:19.204 --> 47:20.036
[laughs]

47:20.071 --> 47:21.604
Yeah, I know, right?

47:21.639 --> 47:22.805
Thanks.

47:22.841 --> 47:27.176
Anyway, after a while there was
no turning back and voila.

47:27.212 --> 47:29.111
Here I am, a lawyer.

47:29.147 --> 47:30.213
[ding]

47:30.248 --> 47:33.282
Oh, perfect timing.

47:33.318 --> 47:36.619
Jordan and my mom should be back
any second.

47:36.654 --> 47:38.721
Alright.

47:39.324 --> 47:41.724
Oooh.

47:42.894 --> 47:49.265
Oh, wow.

47:49.300 --> 47:51.601
Look at this!

47:51.636 --> 47:53.302
Look at what I made.

47:53.338 --> 47:55.638
Well, I mean, look
what I watched you make.

47:55.673 --> 47:57.406
But I'm stealing the credit.

47:57.442 --> 47:59.208
Steal away.

47:59.978 --> 48:03.112
Kitchen, meet your first
roast chicken.

48:03.147 --> 48:04.313
[laughs]

48:04.349 --> 48:06.549
You're amazing.

48:09.821 --> 48:10.453
Hey, guys.

48:10.488 --> 48:11.254
We're home.

48:11.289 --> 48:12.054
Hey, peanut.

48:12.090 --> 48:14.390
How was the movie?

48:14.425 --> 48:15.791
Who made that?

48:15.827 --> 48:17.593
Uh, your mom.

48:17.629 --> 48:20.897
Oh... well, I mean,
you helped a little bit.

48:20.932 --> 48:25.334
[laughs]

48:25.370 --> 48:26.435
Hey, come here.

48:26.471 --> 48:27.570
Wow.

48:28.539 --> 48:29.405
Ok.

48:29.440 --> 48:30.406
This looks amazing.

48:30.441 --> 48:31.607
Shall we?

48:31.643 --> 48:33.075
We shall.

48:47.258 --> 48:49.325
And 30 cents is your change.

48:49.360 --> 48:50.993
And your receipt.

48:51.029 --> 48:51.794
That makes 30.

48:51.829 --> 48:52.828
Thank you.

48:52.864 --> 48:54.063
Hey.

48:54.098 --> 48:55.331
You working hard, big guy?

48:55.366 --> 48:56.132
Yes, boss.

48:56.167 --> 48:57.366
Alright, great.

48:57.402 --> 48:59.969
I think I have the perfect gift
idea for your mother-in-law.

49:00.004 --> 49:00.536
Oh, great.

49:00.571 --> 49:02.305
Yeah, it's over here.

49:10.581 --> 49:12.181
Oh, I love that one.

49:12.216 --> 49:14.216
<i>Yeah, it's good, right?</i>

49:14.252 --> 49:20.122
[chatting]

49:35.873 --> 49:38.207
Hey!

49:38.242 --> 49:39.909
Mom, no PDA.

49:39.944 --> 49:40.876
Ok, alright.

49:40.912 --> 49:43.112
I'm sorry.

49:43.147 --> 49:44.513
That counts, too.

49:44.549 --> 49:46.382
Alright, I won't
do anything else.

49:46.417 --> 49:46.949
Hey, listen.

49:46.985 --> 49:48.684
Grams is out in the car.

49:48.720 --> 49:49.618
I'll meet you out there?

49:49.654 --> 49:50.319
Ok.

49:50.355 --> 49:52.388
Oh, your jacket, right there.

49:52.423 --> 49:54.056
Thank you.

49:54.092 --> 49:54.957
See you next time, buddy.

49:54.993 --> 49:56.592
See ya.

49:56.627 --> 49:57.426
Hey.

49:57.462 --> 49:59.795
Hey.

49:59.831 --> 50:00.963
So, how'd it go?

50:00.999 --> 50:02.698
He is doing great.

50:02.734 --> 50:05.134
Doing percentages in his head,
really getting confident.

50:05.169 --> 50:05.701
What?

50:05.737 --> 50:06.435
Yeah.

50:06.471 --> 50:08.537
Oh, thank you.

50:08.573 --> 50:12.708
I just can't thank you enough.

50:12.744 --> 50:14.744
Ok, well, I'll talk
to you later.

50:14.779 --> 50:18.547
Hey, um... I'm...

50:18.583 --> 50:20.416
I'm gonna put myself out
on a limb here a little bit,

50:20.451 --> 50:26.122
but I was wondering if maybe
you'd be uh, interested in um,

50:26.157 --> 50:30.726
I- I know this great place
and I thought that maybe you uh,

50:30.762 --> 50:32.428
would like to uh...

50:32.463 --> 50:34.263
Go on a date?

50:34.298 --> 50:35.131
Yes, a date.

50:35.166 --> 50:36.165
I was going to get
there eventually.

50:36.200 --> 50:38.300
[laughs]

50:38.336 --> 50:41.103
Um, are you free on Friday?

50:41.139 --> 50:45.107
Fri- oh, Friday night
I have this um,

50:45.143 --> 50:47.643
this office Christmas
party thing.

50:47.678 --> 50:50.012
I would love to get out of it
but I can't.

50:50.048 --> 50:50.980
Ok.

50:51.015 --> 50:53.282
Um, Thursday night?

50:53.317 --> 50:57.453
Thursday I actually have
a date.

50:57.488 --> 51:02.191
Yeah, it's um, it's with this
guy who owns a diner and uh,

51:02.226 --> 51:04.160
his schedule's kinda been
all over the place,

51:04.195 --> 51:06.328
but he did give my son a job
so I was just thinking maybe-

51:06.364 --> 51:07.396
Wow.

51:07.432 --> 51:09.131
You have a little mean streak
in you, don't you?

51:09.167 --> 51:10.466
Mean streak?

51:10.501 --> 51:12.268
I prefer to call it
a playful streak.

51:12.303 --> 51:12.935
Playful?

51:12.970 --> 51:13.669
Yeah.

51:13.704 --> 51:16.772
So, Thursday, 7:00?

51:16.808 --> 51:17.673
Perfect.

51:17.708 --> 51:18.507
Great.

51:18.543 --> 51:19.275
I'll pick you up.

51:19.310 --> 51:19.975
Ok.

51:20.011 --> 51:21.177
Ok.

51:21.212 --> 51:23.946
Here, let me uh...

51:23.981 --> 51:24.780
Thank you.

51:24.816 --> 51:26.849
You're welcome.

51:35.927 --> 51:38.027
Amy loved Christmas.

51:38.062 --> 51:40.196
She especially loved
putting up decorations.

51:40.231 --> 51:42.565
And every year she
would go all out.

51:42.600 --> 51:44.967
But eventually
Amy got too sick.

51:45.002 --> 51:46.902
The cancer spread.

51:46.938 --> 51:50.239
So we decided to sell the school
and move down here.

51:50.274 --> 51:53.909
And we were ready to fight
and she fought and fought.

51:53.945 --> 51:56.679
Sometimes you lose
the fight.

51:56.714 --> 52:00.716
I'm so sorry.

52:00.751 --> 52:03.085
In the beginning,
it was day by day.

52:03.121 --> 52:05.020
Sometimes you can't breathe.

52:05.056 --> 52:08.424
And then eventually...

52:08.459 --> 52:10.726
do you know that expression

52:10.761 --> 52:14.196
"life's a river and it carries
you into your future

52:14.232 --> 52:15.764
whether you wanna go
or not"?

52:15.800 --> 52:17.733
Hmm.

52:17.768 --> 52:21.437
And one day you look up
and realize years have passed

52:21.472 --> 52:25.040
and you are way,
way down the river,

52:25.076 --> 52:30.279
and you see that the sun
is shining, and you go on.

52:30.314 --> 52:34.283
You go on.

52:34.318 --> 52:37.586
So that's my story
and here I am.

52:37.622 --> 52:42.391
Well thank you for trusting
me enough to share it with me.

52:42.426 --> 52:45.094
And also thank you for taking me
to this place

52:45.129 --> 52:47.263
because it's beautiful.

52:47.298 --> 52:49.098
Yeah.

52:49.133 --> 52:50.466
The owners do something
different every year.

52:50.501 --> 52:52.801
They never fail to impress.

52:52.837 --> 52:54.970
I love these blue lights.

52:55.006 --> 52:56.672
And this.

53:00.344 --> 53:03.379
Look at this fire.

53:09.287 --> 53:11.754
Can I just stay here?

53:14.959 --> 53:15.891
Listen.

53:15.927 --> 53:16.759
Do you hear that?

53:16.794 --> 53:18.294
Hear what?

53:18.329 --> 53:20.129
The crackle.

53:20.164 --> 53:25.467
You can tell the age and
kind of wood by how it crackles.

53:25.503 --> 53:27.069
What?

53:27.104 --> 53:28.971
Really. Listen.

53:33.311 --> 53:35.244
I heard it.

53:35.279 --> 53:36.812
I heard it.

53:36.847 --> 53:37.813
[phone ringing]

53:37.848 --> 53:38.781
Oh. Sorry.

53:38.816 --> 53:39.515
It's ok.

53:39.550 --> 53:43.519
I should put this thing
on mute.

53:43.554 --> 53:45.788
Um, I have to take this.

53:45.823 --> 53:47.656
Yeah, of course.

53:52.997 --> 53:53.996
Tanner?

53:54.031 --> 53:56.699
I dropped him.

53:56.734 --> 53:57.499
Your friend's husband.

53:57.535 --> 53:58.567
Lauren?

53:58.603 --> 54:02.037
I told Charlie he needed to find
another attorney.

54:02.073 --> 54:04.773
Thank you, Tanner.

54:04.809 --> 54:06.208
Thank you.

54:06.244 --> 54:09.979
<i>In fact, I told him he should
consider taking a breather.</i>

54:10.014 --> 54:11.714
<i>Not rush into things.</i>

54:11.749 --> 54:15.017
<i>Give his marriage
another chance.</i>

54:15.052 --> 54:16.619
I don't know what to say.

54:16.654 --> 54:18.821
I mean, what in the world
made you...

54:18.856 --> 54:20.356
<i>You did.</i>

54:20.391 --> 54:25.527
Maggie, you and me,
that's all that matters to me.

54:25.563 --> 54:28.664
Tanner, I've gotta call
you back, ok?

54:28.699 --> 54:30.599
Alright.

54:33.537 --> 54:35.904
I picked myself up
from divorce and right

54:35.940 --> 54:37.806
when I think I've got
my bearings

54:37.842 --> 54:40.075
and I think my life is
gonna be ok

54:40.111 --> 54:41.510
another curve ball is
thrown at me

54:41.545 --> 54:44.380
and then I'm right back
where I started.

54:44.415 --> 54:47.316
Maggie, are you listening
to any of this?

54:47.351 --> 54:48.317
Yeah, yeah.

54:48.352 --> 54:50.886
Of course I'm listening.

54:50.921 --> 54:52.221
So what should I do?

54:52.256 --> 54:53.822
Charlie says he wants
to come back.

54:53.858 --> 54:57.559
He wants to try to give
the marriage another chance.

54:57.595 --> 54:59.061
Can I believe him?

54:59.096 --> 55:00.362
Should I take him back?

55:00.398 --> 55:04.099
I feel so... I know
what it is.

55:04.135 --> 55:08.771
I don't know if I trust
my own judgment.

55:08.806 --> 55:09.772
I- I don't know.

55:09.807 --> 55:10.706
Well, that's helpful.

55:10.741 --> 55:13.776
Look, all I'm saying is
that we could sit

55:13.811 --> 55:16.412
and write all these facts
down here on this legal pad

55:16.447 --> 55:19.181
but what is that gonna tell us?

55:19.216 --> 55:20.449
Ok?

55:20.484 --> 55:24.687
It's gonna tell us that life
is one big giant roller coaster

55:24.722 --> 55:27.690
and that the most important
decisions that we make?

55:27.725 --> 55:30.192
They're not even based
on facts.

55:30.227 --> 55:34.396
We're guided by the spaces
in between the facts, you know?

55:34.432 --> 55:38.300
Instinct and- and faith.

55:38.336 --> 55:43.872
My best legal advice to you
is not even legal at all.

55:43.908 --> 55:47.109
What does your heart
tell you to do?

55:47.144 --> 55:51.880
And better yet, do you have
the fortitude

55:51.916 --> 55:55.250
to take your chances
on the roller coaster?

56:03.461 --> 56:05.461
[knocks softly]

56:05.496 --> 56:07.096
Hey, you.

56:07.131 --> 56:09.598
Hey.

56:09.633 --> 56:16.205
Uh, I just... I wanted
to say thank you.

56:16.240 --> 56:18.507
I think I underestimated your-

56:18.542 --> 56:21.009
Humanity?

56:21.045 --> 56:22.544
Well, yeah.

56:22.580 --> 56:24.113
[laughs]

56:24.148 --> 56:25.647
Ouch.

56:25.683 --> 56:28.150
Well, the good news is
they're giving their marriage

56:28.185 --> 56:29.284
another shot.

56:29.320 --> 56:31.320
I'm happy for them.

56:31.355 --> 56:32.688
It's bad for business, but...

56:32.723 --> 56:33.722
Oh, you.

56:33.758 --> 56:36.692
Besides, you know I'd move
a mountain for you.

56:36.727 --> 56:38.360
Just ask.

56:38.396 --> 56:40.996
I really do appreciate
what you did.

56:41.031 --> 56:44.500
Well, I have to get back to a
very important conference call.

56:44.535 --> 56:47.236
I'll pick you up
at 5:00 tonight?

56:47.271 --> 56:49.805
You know, since the party's
here at the office,

56:49.840 --> 56:51.807
why don't I just meet you here?

56:51.842 --> 56:53.509
But you're my date.

56:53.544 --> 56:55.677
And there's a surprise coming.

56:55.713 --> 56:57.346
Tonight's a big night.

56:57.381 --> 56:58.847
What surprise?

56:58.883 --> 57:00.983
You'll see.

57:01.018 --> 57:01.984
I'll pick you up at 5:00.

57:02.019 --> 57:03.018
Ok.

57:04.054 --> 57:05.821
Alright.

57:08.125 --> 57:08.824
[bell rings]

57:08.859 --> 57:11.560
Ooh, oh.

57:11.595 --> 57:13.395
Hey, Billy.

57:13.431 --> 57:14.830
What a morning, huh?

57:14.865 --> 57:16.098
Hey, thank you.

57:16.133 --> 57:18.100
Ooh man, give me another
60 degrees,

57:18.135 --> 57:19.501
some balmy island air,

57:19.537 --> 57:20.702
and then we'll talk about
good morning.

57:20.738 --> 57:21.870
I'll give you a little piece
of advice.

57:21.906 --> 57:24.006
There's no such thing
as cold weather.

57:24.041 --> 57:25.874
Just inadequate clothing.

57:25.910 --> 57:26.909
Mmm.

57:26.944 --> 57:29.178
I'll keep that in mind.

57:29.213 --> 57:33.682
So, how was uh,
last night?

57:33.717 --> 57:35.517
The big date?

57:35.553 --> 57:38.086
I'm not gonna tell you
about my private life.

57:38.122 --> 57:39.354
Hey, you don't have to.

57:39.390 --> 57:41.723
It's written all over your face.

57:41.759 --> 57:45.027
A little uh, honest observation?

57:45.062 --> 57:46.929
I've never seen you like this.

57:46.964 --> 57:51.533
Well, there is something
about her.

57:51.569 --> 57:55.471
Yeah, I see the way you guys
look at each other.

57:55.506 --> 57:58.140
So, you uh, think you're ready?

57:58.175 --> 57:59.074
Ready for what?

57:59.109 --> 57:59.641
Come on, man.

57:59.677 --> 58:02.277
You know what I mean.

58:02.313 --> 58:04.279
This, this.

58:04.315 --> 58:08.584
Well, it's been three years
and... I'll never be over Amy,

58:08.619 --> 58:11.820
but I think I'm doing ok.

58:11.856 --> 58:14.556
You know, I can't tell you
how to do this,

58:14.592 --> 58:16.825
but for your sake,

58:16.861 --> 58:22.264
before you grab onto the future
you need to let go of the past.

58:22.299 --> 58:22.998
Yeah.

58:23.033 --> 58:25.100
Yeah.

58:27.338 --> 58:29.071
Yeah.

58:34.712 --> 58:39.081
[party chatter]

58:39.116 --> 58:42.050
Excuse me while I steal
this beautiful woman.

58:45.523 --> 58:47.322
Excuse me, guys.

58:49.793 --> 58:50.192
Yeah?

58:50.227 --> 58:51.193
What's going on?

58:51.228 --> 58:54.463
Um, in a minute my boss
over there is gonna tell

58:54.498 --> 58:58.534
the same lawyer joke
he tells every year.

58:58.569 --> 59:01.937
But then he's gonna announce
that they wanna make me

59:01.972 --> 59:03.772
partner in this firm.

59:03.807 --> 59:04.973
What?

59:05.009 --> 59:06.808
Tanner, congratulations.

59:06.844 --> 59:08.477
That's incredible.

59:08.512 --> 59:09.678
That's- it's just-

59:09.713 --> 59:13.115
Sure, it's a big deal and I've
worked hard for it, but...

59:13.150 --> 59:14.483
<i>Excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

59:14.518 --> 59:15.684
<i>Excuse me.</i>

59:15.719 --> 59:17.486
On behalf of the other partners
I'd just like to thank you

59:17.521 --> 59:19.354
so much for-
for coming out.

59:19.390 --> 59:23.625
I know you'd rather be with your
families, but... ok, joke time.

59:23.661 --> 59:24.560
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

59:24.595 --> 59:25.661
I guess I'm a minute off.

59:25.696 --> 59:30.032
Um... be with me,
Maggie.

59:30.067 --> 59:31.400
I'm about to become partner
in this firm

59:31.435 --> 59:34.736
but all I wanna be
is your partner.

59:34.772 --> 59:36.505
What's the point of success
if you don't have anyone

59:36.540 --> 59:38.707
to share it with?

59:38.742 --> 59:41.677
And you and me,
we belong together.

59:41.712 --> 59:46.548
We both know it, so
let's make it official.

59:48.018 --> 59:51.687
I just... this is all coming
at me really fast.

59:51.722 --> 59:57.192
Well, life happens fast but when
you know it's right you just...

59:57.227 --> 59:58.727
you grab it.

59:58.762 --> 01:00:01.029
Here.

01:00:05.369 --> 01:00:07.035
Two tickets to Italy.

01:00:07.071 --> 01:00:08.337
First class.

01:00:08.372 --> 01:00:09.571
We leave next week.

01:00:09.607 --> 01:00:10.439
Just you and me.

01:00:10.474 --> 01:00:12.908
We'll ring in the new
year together.

01:00:12.943 --> 01:00:14.109
The beginning of our beginning.

01:00:14.144 --> 01:00:16.778
<i>Tanner Ryan, where are you?</i>

01:00:16.814 --> 01:00:18.113
Come on up here, Tanner.

01:00:18.148 --> 01:00:18.714
Come on, Tanner.

01:00:18.749 --> 01:00:21.683
Come up!

01:00:22.486 --> 01:00:23.285
Come up here.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:24.853
Tanner Ryan,

01:00:26.991 --> 01:00:28.023
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:00:28.058 --> 01:00:33.395
<i>Thanks for being here.
Thanks so much.</i>

01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:34.396
<i>Thanks boss.</i>

01:00:34.431 --> 01:00:35.864
Good high five.

01:00:36.333 --> 01:00:37.032
Martha?

01:00:37.067 --> 01:00:38.133
Oh, hey.

01:00:38.168 --> 01:00:39.134
Can you just make sure
that Tanner gets this back?

01:00:39.169 --> 01:00:40.435
Yeah, absolutely.

01:00:40.471 --> 01:00:41.803
<i>Please welcome our new partner.</i>

01:02:08.258 --> 01:02:10.325
Hi.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:13.862
So do you know the song "The
Twelve Days of Christmas"?

01:02:13.897 --> 01:02:15.831
Yeah- yeah, of course.

01:02:15.866 --> 01:02:16.965
Why?

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.067
Well, did you know that if you
add up all the presents

01:02:19.103 --> 01:02:21.570
from all the verses
you get 364

01:02:21.605 --> 01:02:27.008
which is all the days of
the year minus Christmas.

01:02:27.044 --> 01:02:31.713
Is the teacher trying to give me
another tutorial?

01:02:31.749 --> 01:02:37.219
No, I'm trying to tell you
I would really like

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:39.488
to see you tomorrow.

01:02:43.393 --> 01:02:45.727
I'd like that.

01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:56.138

01:02:57.274 --> 01:02:58.807

01:02:58.842 --> 01:03:01.443

01:03:01.478 --> 01:03:04.846
I've got a surprise for ya.

01:03:04.882 --> 01:03:08.049
We're going out tonight.

01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:15.157
And I thought you might like
to know that your buddy

01:03:15.192 --> 01:03:18.193
Casey is going with us.

01:03:18.228 --> 01:03:19.161

01:03:19.196 --> 01:03:20.295

01:03:20.330 --> 01:03:21.296
Yeah.

01:03:21.331 --> 01:03:22.464
Here.

01:03:22.499 --> 01:03:23.698
Put your shoes on.

01:03:23.734 --> 01:03:25.200
I'll meet you downstairs, ok?

01:03:25.235 --> 01:03:25.867
Ok.

01:03:25.903 --> 01:03:27.602
Alright.

01:03:34.344 --> 01:03:36.344
Jordan, stay close, ok?

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:37.979
It's ok, we can keep an eye
on him.

01:03:38.015 --> 01:03:40.982
<i>Look who he's uh,
talking to.</i>

01:03:41.018 --> 01:03:42.050
<i>Oh, how did I miss that?</i>

01:03:42.085 --> 01:03:45.620
He's had his eye on her
for the last ten minutes.

01:03:45.656 --> 01:03:48.456
What if she hurts his feelings?

01:03:48.492 --> 01:03:56.198
Well, you can't get anything you
want unless you take a chance.

01:03:56.233 --> 01:03:58.500
Take a chance.

It's two days 'til Christmas.

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:29.064
Maggie... I think I'm falling
in love with you.

01:04:37.608 --> 01:04:38.373
I can't do this.

01:04:38.408 --> 01:04:39.274
Woah, what is it?

01:04:39.309 --> 01:04:40.709
Maggie, you can tell me.

01:04:40.744 --> 01:04:41.576
It's just Christmas.

01:04:41.612 --> 01:04:42.577
What does that mean?

01:04:42.613 --> 01:04:44.746
I need more than that.

01:04:48.785 --> 01:04:50.218
Yeah.

01:04:55.225 --> 01:04:57.192
Ok.

01:05:01.632 --> 01:05:04.466
When I was 13 years old
I went to Lake Tahoe

01:05:04.501 --> 01:05:10.105
with my family and um,
it was Christmas.

01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:14.309
And it was beautiful
and I remember

01:05:14.344 --> 01:05:21.716
it was the happiest time...

01:05:21.752 --> 01:05:25.086
I remember the snow.

01:05:26.356 --> 01:05:34.663
And then out of the blue
my father leaves us.

01:05:34.698 --> 01:05:38.934
Just... just like that.

01:05:38.969 --> 01:05:41.836
He just left.

01:05:41.872 --> 01:05:46.975
And it broke my mother.

01:05:47.010 --> 01:05:48.276
Maggie, that was
a long time ago.

01:05:48.312 --> 01:05:52.514
It happened again
with Jordan's dad.

01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:58.286
At Christmas.

01:05:58.322 --> 01:06:04.793
He just left us.

01:06:04.828 --> 01:06:08.430
And every year I'm reminded
of how dangerous it is

01:06:08.465 --> 01:06:11.733
for me to let hope in.

01:06:12.669 --> 01:06:15.870
Maggie, you can't hold on
to the past.

01:06:15.906 --> 01:06:19.107
Do you see that little boy
right there?

01:06:19.142 --> 01:06:22.110
He's my world.

01:06:22.145 --> 01:06:27.983
And I won't let anything
hurt him ever again.

01:06:28.018 --> 01:06:34.689
Maggie, miracles happen
at Christmas.

01:06:34.725 --> 01:06:38.093
Not to me, they don't.

01:06:39.162 --> 01:06:40.228
Hey, Jordan, baby?

01:06:40.263 --> 01:06:41.930
Come on.

01:06:45.335 --> 01:06:47.602
Come on.

01:06:56.847 --> 01:06:58.313
<i>Dear God.</i>

01:06:58.348 --> 01:07:01.549
<i>It's almost Christmas.</i>

01:07:01.585 --> 01:07:05.553
<i>Please, make my mom
happy again.</i>

01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:09.758
<i>Can't you see that Casey
makes her happy?</i>

01:07:09.793 --> 01:07:11.826
<i>What makes a dad?</i>

01:07:11.862 --> 01:07:13.862
<i>Can anybody be a dad,</i>

01:07:13.897 --> 01:07:18.433
<i>even if they don't have kids?</i>

01:07:18.468 --> 01:07:20.902
<i>Please, God.</i>

01:07:20.937 --> 01:07:22.971
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

01:07:39.423 --> 01:07:40.588
Hey, sleepy head.

01:07:40.624 --> 01:07:42.257
Oh, hey Billy.

01:07:42.292 --> 01:07:44.092
You want the usual?

01:07:44.127 --> 01:07:45.393
Oh, no.

01:07:45.429 --> 01:07:47.896
I'm ok.

01:08:11.421 --> 01:08:11.820
Hey.

01:08:11.855 --> 01:08:14.522
Earth to Casey.

01:08:17.861 --> 01:08:21.962
Uh... hey, Billy, can I ask you
a big favor?

01:08:21.997 --> 01:08:24.131
I- I got a... a thing.

01:08:24.167 --> 01:08:26.901
I- can you look after
the diner for a bit?

01:08:26.937 --> 01:08:27.469
Yeah.

01:08:27.504 --> 01:08:28.736
Oh, woah, hey, hey man.

01:08:28.772 --> 01:08:29.671
Oh, right.

01:08:29.706 --> 01:08:30.404
Thanks.

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:31.272
Yeah.

01:08:31.308 --> 01:08:33.241
I'll talk to you later.

01:09:41.611 --> 01:09:42.977
Does Casey know
you made him a scarf?

01:09:43.013 --> 01:09:44.212
No, silly.

01:09:44.247 --> 01:09:46.247
It's a Christmas present.

01:09:46.283 --> 01:09:48.716
We're gonna go on another
adventure with him, right?

01:09:48.752 --> 01:09:49.651
Oh, I don't know.

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:51.319
I don't think so.

01:09:51.354 --> 01:09:53.220
But I'm still gonna work
with him, right?

01:09:53.256 --> 01:09:55.423
Honey, you're going back
to school soon.

01:09:55.458 --> 01:09:57.358
We're just dropping off
some presents.

01:09:57.394 --> 01:09:59.027
I don't wanna go to school.

01:09:59.062 --> 01:10:01.029
Oh, come on.

01:10:01.064 --> 01:10:03.131
Let's go see Casey, huh?

01:10:05.869 --> 01:10:07.502
Hey.

01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:08.736
Hey.

01:10:08.772 --> 01:10:09.671
Oh, thank you.

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:11.072
What is this?

01:10:11.107 --> 01:10:12.674
And grandma's made you
a scarf.

01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:15.210
Jordan.

01:10:15.245 --> 01:10:16.778
So much for the surprise.

01:10:16.813 --> 01:10:17.445
Thank you.

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:20.715
Ooh, Jordan,
my main man.

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:22.550
What's up?

01:10:22.586 --> 01:10:25.253
Maggie hasn't told me what
happened between the two of you

01:10:25.288 --> 01:10:27.188
yesterday and it's really
none of my business...

01:10:27.224 --> 01:10:29.924
Oh, that's ok.

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:32.060
If you'd just let her know that
I'm thinking of her.

01:10:32.095 --> 01:10:34.762
I know you are.

01:10:34.798 --> 01:10:37.131
I have some things for you guys,
as well.

01:10:37.167 --> 01:10:39.701
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

01:10:42.105 --> 01:10:45.473
Hey, buddy.

01:10:45.508 --> 01:10:47.775
These are for you
and your family.

01:10:47.811 --> 01:10:52.780
But... I am not gonna tell you
what they are,

01:10:52.816 --> 01:10:54.983
so you're gonna have to wait
until Christmas to open them.

01:10:55.018 --> 01:10:55.750
Come on.

01:10:55.785 --> 01:10:57.318
<i>[laughs]</i>

01:10:57.354 --> 01:10:59.821
You are a kind man, Casey.

01:10:59.856 --> 01:11:00.955
<i>Merry Christmas to you.</i>

01:11:00.991 --> 01:11:03.358
Merry Christmas, Terry.

01:11:04.294 --> 01:11:05.493
Uh, Jordan, honey,
we gotta get going

01:11:05.528 --> 01:11:07.795
'cause I'm double
parked outside.

01:11:07.831 --> 01:11:09.564
Ok.

01:11:09.599 --> 01:11:10.465
Hey, Casey?

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:11.466
Yeah?

01:11:11.501 --> 01:11:14.636
Is FedEx like a person
or a machine or what?

01:11:14.671 --> 01:11:15.970
FedEx?

01:11:16.006 --> 01:11:16.704
Yeah.

01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:18.906
'Cause this has
to be somewhere.

01:11:18.942 --> 01:11:21.976
Ok, well... there's no address
on it.

01:11:22.012 --> 01:11:23.511
Who's it for?

01:11:23.546 --> 01:11:26.914
Uh, God.

01:11:27.717 --> 01:11:30.752
Do you think God cares
if things are misspelled?

01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:32.654
No.

01:11:32.689 --> 01:11:35.156
I don't think God cares.

01:11:35.191 --> 01:11:37.692
Good.

01:11:37.727 --> 01:11:39.661
Ok, I have to go.

01:11:39.696 --> 01:11:40.662
Bye.

01:11:40.697 --> 01:11:43.765
Come on honey.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.233
Bye-bye.

01:11:54.311 --> 01:11:58.446
Maggie, this looks ridiculous
without a real tree.

01:11:58.481 --> 01:12:00.281
Mom, do you know how many houses
burn down

01:12:00.317 --> 01:12:02.483
because of Christmas
trees every year?

01:12:02.519 --> 01:12:05.286
It's only when people are
too lazy to take them down.

01:12:05.322 --> 01:12:07.021
I mean, this looks silly.

01:12:07.057 --> 01:12:08.623
Grams said we get
to open a present

01:12:08.658 --> 01:12:09.891
'cause it's Christmas Eve.

01:12:09.926 --> 01:12:10.191
Do we?

01:12:10.226 --> 01:12:11.326
Please?

01:12:11.361 --> 01:12:12.360
I- yeah- yes.

01:12:12.395 --> 01:12:14.462
You can open one.

01:12:16.566 --> 01:12:17.899
I want Casey's.

01:12:17.934 --> 01:12:20.968
After dinner, please.

01:12:39.923 --> 01:12:42.156
Whatever is spinning around
in that head of yours,

01:12:42.192 --> 01:12:43.725
maybe this'll cheer it up.

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:46.227
Oh, thanks man.

01:12:46.262 --> 01:12:47.862
Merry Christmas, brother.

01:12:47.897 --> 01:12:49.897
Yep.

01:12:49.933 --> 01:12:51.999
So, we did really good
this season.

01:12:52.035 --> 01:12:54.602
Sold all the cocoa, all
the trees are gone except

01:12:54.637 --> 01:12:57.505
for the ugly one but you took
that one, so...

01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:59.107
Hey, that tree's not ugly.

01:12:59.142 --> 01:13:00.174
[laughs]

01:13:00.210 --> 01:13:01.309
You know what I hate?

01:13:01.344 --> 01:13:03.878
The day after New Year's
and all the trees are piled up

01:13:03.913 --> 01:13:06.514
on the sidewalk
and I'm like hey!

01:13:06.549 --> 01:13:09.283
Those are my kids!

01:13:09.319 --> 01:13:10.918
You're coming tonight, right?

01:13:10.954 --> 01:13:13.087
You and your long face
are invited.

01:13:13.123 --> 01:13:14.255
Oh, I- I don't-

01:13:14.290 --> 01:13:15.123
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

01:13:15.158 --> 01:13:18.126
May has made enough food
to feed an army.

01:13:18.161 --> 01:13:19.260
She making that spicy pork?

01:13:19.295 --> 01:13:20.228
Oh.

01:13:20.263 --> 01:13:22.930
Yeah, it's tradition.

01:13:22.966 --> 01:13:24.365
Ok, I'll be there.

01:13:24.401 --> 01:13:25.767
That's my man.

01:13:25.802 --> 01:13:29.871
But first I gotta...
I gotta do something.

01:13:29.906 --> 01:13:30.872
Alright.

01:13:30.907 --> 01:13:32.707
If you don't get there
by 8:30 I'm gonna eat

01:13:32.742 --> 01:13:34.075
all that spicy pork myself.

01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:35.910
Ok.

01:13:41.284 --> 01:13:43.451
Dig into it.

01:13:46.423 --> 01:13:50.658
Oh, what is it?

01:13:50.693 --> 01:13:51.893
Casey knew I liked this.

01:13:51.928 --> 01:13:54.629
Oh, Jordan that's nice.

01:13:55.365 --> 01:13:56.330
Yeah.

01:13:56.366 --> 01:13:59.500
That's sweet.

01:13:59.536 --> 01:14:00.868
<i>Let me see what's in this.</i>

01:14:00.904 --> 01:14:05.173
Oh, these are so cute.

01:14:05.208 --> 01:14:07.175
[laughs]

01:14:07.210 --> 01:14:09.010
Oh, he even knows my size.

01:14:09.045 --> 01:14:11.846
Ah, he knows your style.

01:14:11.881 --> 01:14:12.914
I gotta try them on.

01:14:12.949 --> 01:14:14.849
Honey, open yours.

01:14:14.884 --> 01:14:15.783
Ok, which one is it?

01:14:15.819 --> 01:14:17.218
Let's see.

01:14:17.253 --> 01:14:18.453
Is it this one, baby?

01:14:18.488 --> 01:14:19.554
This one?

01:14:19.589 --> 01:14:21.756
Ok.

01:14:22.725 --> 01:14:24.225
It's kinda heavy.

01:14:25.295 --> 01:14:27.195
Ok.

01:14:37.574 --> 01:14:40.575
Oh, mom.

01:14:40.610 --> 01:14:43.211
That's where we stayed.

01:14:43.246 --> 01:14:45.279
It's Tahoe.

01:14:45.315 --> 01:14:47.381
Well, how did he know?

01:14:47.417 --> 01:14:50.384
I mentioned it to him.

01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:51.786
He collects these.

01:14:51.821 --> 01:14:54.889
That's so sweet.

01:14:57.193 --> 01:14:59.727
Well.

01:14:59.762 --> 01:15:02.730
Well, that was very nice of Ca-

01:15:02.765 --> 01:15:04.165
What's wrong, baby?

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.933
I want Casey to be here.

01:15:05.969 --> 01:15:07.068
Hey.

01:15:07.103 --> 01:15:07.635
Hey.

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:08.603
Hold on.

01:15:08.638 --> 01:15:09.270
Jordan-

01:15:09.305 --> 01:15:10.972
Maggie.

01:15:11.007 --> 01:15:13.741
Just give him some space.

01:15:20.717 --> 01:15:22.550
Ok.

01:16:00.857 --> 01:16:03.024
[giggling]

01:16:09.332 --> 01:16:10.831
[knocking]

01:16:10.867 --> 01:16:12.233
Honey?

01:16:12.268 --> 01:16:13.034
Hey.

01:16:13.069 --> 01:16:16.304
An envelope was just left
for you.

01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:25.279
I heard the doorbell and it
was just left at the front door.

01:16:29.686 --> 01:16:32.820
Casey left it.

01:16:32.855 --> 01:16:34.655
It's a letter.

01:16:34.691 --> 01:16:35.590
Jordan wrote it.

01:16:35.625 --> 01:16:37.024
<i>Dear God.</i>

01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:39.193
<i>How does snow happen?</i>

01:16:39.228 --> 01:16:41.829
<i>Can you read human words?</i>

01:16:41.864 --> 01:16:45.032
<i>Are trees really dirty?</i>

01:16:45.068 --> 01:16:48.402
<i>Are all moms sad all the time?</i>

01:16:48.438 --> 01:16:52.873
<i>What's the difference between
being mad and being worried?</i>

01:16:52.909 --> 01:16:55.242
<i>What makes a dad?</i>

01:16:55.278 --> 01:17:00.881
<i>Can anybody be a dad,
even if they don't have kids?</i>

01:17:00.917 --> 01:17:02.550
<i>It's almost Christmas.</i>

01:17:02.585 --> 01:17:06.253
<i>Please, make my mom
happy again.</i>

01:17:06.289 --> 01:17:09.991
<i>Can't you see that Casey
makes her happy?</i>

01:17:10.026 --> 01:17:11.425
When did he leave this?

01:17:11.461 --> 01:17:12.493
Just now.

01:17:12.528 --> 01:17:14.595
Just when I woke you up.

01:17:14.631 --> 01:17:15.796
I'll be back.

01:17:15.832 --> 01:17:17.531
Maggie.

01:17:37.553 --> 01:17:40.855
Maggie.

01:17:40.890 --> 01:17:44.058
He was trying to tell me
to be brave.

01:17:49.232 --> 01:17:52.099
How did I get this so wrong?

01:17:52.135 --> 01:17:53.534
You know?

01:17:53.569 --> 01:17:55.636
I'm trying to protect him
but all this time-

01:17:55.672 --> 01:17:58.272
He was trying to protect you.

01:17:58.307 --> 01:18:01.008
Yeah.

01:18:01.044 --> 01:18:03.377
I have something else
for you.

01:18:03.413 --> 01:18:07.515
Stop with the gifts.

01:18:09.919 --> 01:18:12.153
[laughs]

01:18:12.188 --> 01:18:13.054
What?

01:18:13.089 --> 01:18:14.155
The wrapping.

01:18:14.190 --> 01:18:15.489
It's really cute.

01:18:15.525 --> 01:18:17.158
I like it.

01:18:28.004 --> 01:18:29.770
What?

01:18:32.041 --> 01:18:32.840
<i>Nope.</i>

01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:33.674
<i>I wasn't ready.</i>

01:18:33.710 --> 01:18:34.375
<i>Ok.</i>

01:18:34.410 --> 01:18:35.376
Close your eyes.

01:18:35.411 --> 01:18:36.744
Trust me.

01:18:36.779 --> 01:18:38.779
Ok.

01:18:42.085 --> 01:18:45.152
You're Kade?

01:18:45.188 --> 01:18:46.554
Why didn't you tell me?

01:18:46.589 --> 01:18:48.522
I didn't know.

01:18:48.558 --> 01:18:51.192
Not until yesterday.

01:18:54.764 --> 01:18:56.897
Oh my gosh.

01:18:56.933 --> 01:19:00.367
I don't believe it.

01:19:00.403 --> 01:19:03.070
I don't believe it.

01:19:07.710 --> 01:19:09.176
But what about your name?

01:19:09.212 --> 01:19:10.611
Did you change it?

01:19:10.646 --> 01:19:11.278
No.

01:19:11.314 --> 01:19:14.749
No, I'm still Kade Cummins.

01:19:14.784 --> 01:19:16.450
They started calling me Casey
in high school

01:19:16.486 --> 01:19:19.854
and it just sort of stuck.

01:19:19.889 --> 01:19:23.424
Do you know how many years
this little boy

01:19:23.459 --> 01:19:28.229
longed to be with
this little girl?

01:19:28.264 --> 01:19:31.599
Yeah, I do.

01:19:31.634 --> 01:19:35.703
But never in a million years
did I think

01:19:35.738 --> 01:19:41.809
that we would ever find
each other again.

01:19:41.844 --> 01:19:44.278
Do you remember
the snow angels?

01:19:44.313 --> 01:19:47.214
I remember everything.

01:19:49.852 --> 01:19:53.254
So you believe in
Christmas miracles?

01:19:53.289 --> 01:19:55.122
Yes.

01:19:55.158 --> 01:19:55.956
You got me.

01:19:55.992 --> 01:19:57.825
Yes. I do.

01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:01.095
I've been so wrong about that.

01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:02.897
Yeah, you know what?

01:20:02.932 --> 01:20:06.567
Christmas is exactly
when miracles happen.

01:20:09.338 --> 01:20:10.304
Wait.

01:20:10.339 --> 01:20:11.939
What?

01:20:11.974 --> 01:20:16.744
I just... I feel so bad
about Jordan, you know?

01:20:16.779 --> 01:20:19.814
I've just tried to protect
that kid all of my life

01:20:19.849 --> 01:20:24.451
and I've been so afraid
that life was gonna...

01:20:24.487 --> 01:20:27.655
disappoint him.

01:20:27.690 --> 01:20:30.825
I disappointed him.

01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:38.332
And I don't- I don't
wanna do that this Christmas.

01:20:38.367 --> 01:20:40.601
What are you thinking?

01:20:40.636 --> 01:20:45.639
Um, can you call Billy?

01:20:45.675 --> 01:20:47.508
Billy?

01:20:47.543 --> 01:20:48.542
Yeah.

01:20:48.578 --> 01:20:51.645
I wanna get him a tree.

01:20:51.681 --> 01:20:53.581
Ok.

01:20:55.218 --> 01:20:57.084
Ok.

01:21:02.992 --> 01:21:04.358
Come on in.

01:21:04.994 --> 01:21:05.826
Shh.

01:21:05.862 --> 01:21:07.361
He's still asleep.

01:21:07.396 --> 01:21:09.230
I can't believe you found one.

01:21:09.265 --> 01:21:10.698
Yeah, it might be the last tree
in the whole city.

01:21:10.733 --> 01:21:11.932
Yeah, it's a beauty.

01:21:11.968 --> 01:21:15.870
And we cleared out every box
of decorations from the diner.

01:21:15.905 --> 01:21:16.971
Can you two handle this?

01:21:17.006 --> 01:21:19.039
I gotta get back to my own kids
before they wake up.

01:21:19.075 --> 01:21:20.140
Sure.

01:21:20.176 --> 01:21:20.975
Thanks.

01:21:21.010 --> 01:21:22.376
Thank you, Billy.

01:21:22.411 --> 01:21:23.010
You got it.

01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:23.811
Merry Christmas, you two.

01:21:23.846 --> 01:21:25.079
Merry Christmas.

01:21:25.114 --> 01:21:26.780
Bye.

01:21:30.753 --> 01:21:33.053
[together] Best Christmas ever.

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:54.108
Ok, I think we're almost ready.

01:21:54.143 --> 01:21:54.842
You got the lights?

01:21:54.877 --> 01:21:55.609
Yeah.

01:21:55.645 --> 01:21:56.710
Ok.

01:21:56.746 --> 01:21:58.779
Ok. Ready?

01:21:58.814 --> 01:22:00.047
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:22:04.253 --> 01:22:08.889
[whispering] One, two, three.

01:22:08.925 --> 01:22:10.891
Oh, it's beautiful.

01:22:10.927 --> 01:22:11.392
Yeah.

01:22:11.427 --> 01:22:12.126
Except for this--

01:22:12.161 --> 01:22:12.893
Hey. Hey.

01:22:12.929 --> 01:22:13.794
Yeah?

01:22:13.829 --> 01:22:16.030
Merry Christmas.

01:22:16.065 --> 01:22:19.099
Merry Christmas.

01:22:21.504 --> 01:22:23.904
Ah, we have a tree!

01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:26.373
A Christmas tree!

01:22:26.409 --> 01:22:28.075
Merry Christmas, baby!

01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:29.443
And Casey?

01:22:29.478 --> 01:22:33.380
Yeah, it looks like God answered
your letter.

01:22:33.416 --> 01:22:35.950
Oh my.

01:22:35.985 --> 01:22:38.953
Isn't this a sight to behold.

01:22:38.988 --> 01:22:40.955
Merry Christmas, mom.

01:22:40.990 --> 01:22:41.922
Merry Christmas.

01:22:41.958 --> 01:22:44.258
Merry Christmas, Terry.

01:22:44.293 --> 01:22:45.392
Look at the tree.

01:22:45.428 --> 01:22:46.760
I know, I see it.

01:22:46.796 --> 01:22:48.162
How did it get here?

01:22:48.197 --> 01:22:50.264
It must be a miracle.

01:22:50.299 --> 01:22:52.166
Wait 'til you hear
the rest of it.

01:22:52.201 --> 01:22:54.134
Oh, I need a photo of this.

01:22:54.170 --> 01:22:55.135
Jordan, get in the middle.

01:22:55.171 --> 01:22:56.070
Yeah, come on.

01:22:56.105 --> 01:22:57.304
Ok.

01:22:57.340 --> 01:22:57.972
Hold on.

01:22:58.007 --> 01:22:59.139
Everybody ready?

01:22:59.175 --> 01:23:00.507
Here we go.

01:23:00.543 --> 01:23:03.410
[together] Merry Christmas.

01:23:03.446 --> 01:23:04.278
There it is.

01:23:04.313 --> 01:23:05.145
I wasn't ready.

01:23:05.181 --> 01:23:06.280
Ok, here we go.

01:23:06.315 --> 01:23:07.014
Ok.

01:23:07.049 --> 01:23:07.648
Make it bigger.

01:23:07.683 --> 01:23:08.849
Big one.

01:23:08.884 --> 01:23:11.085
[together] Merry Christmas!
