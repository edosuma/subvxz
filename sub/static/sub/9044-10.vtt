THIS IS MY HOUSE TOO.

00:54.967 --> 00:56.233
IF I PUT SOMETHING THERE,

00:56.233 --> 00:58.400
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET TO IT
WHEN I GET TO IT.

00:58.400 --> 01:00.967
YOU KNOW I'M A SLOW READER.

01:00.967 --> 01:03.233

RATHER LOOK AT THIS.

02:04.500 --> 02:05.867

02:09.833 --> 02:12.367
- YEAH.

02:12.367 --> 02:14.900

02:36.267 --> 02:38.367
MY PARTNER AND I,
WE WENT ON THIS CALL, RIGHT?

02:38.367 --> 02:40.667
AND THERE WAS THIS NUT JOB LADY
WHO WAS BOTHERING ALI.

NO, HE DOES NOT
HAVE A CRUSH ON ME.

04:50.967 --> 04:53.400
HE ONLY LOVES ME
FOR MY GARBAGE.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.867

07:08.767 --> 07:11.233
- OH, DEAR. I TOLD YOU.

07:11.233 --> 07:14.167
YOU KNOW,
SALT IS JUST A SEASONING.

07:14.167 --> 07:16.433
IT CAN'T BE
THE MAIN INGREDIENT.

07:16.433 --> 07:19.233
- NO, NO, NO, MARIE,
IT'S NOT THAT.

07:19.233 --> 07:22.467
RAY GOT THIS LETTER
FROM MUHAMMAD ALI--

07:22.467 --> 07:24.133
- I HEARD!

07:24.133 --> 07:25.700
YOU KNOW THAT
ROBERT'S RESPONSIBLE

07:25.700 --> 07:27.100
FOR THE CORRESPONDENCE?

07:27.100 --> 07:28.433
- YES, I KNOW.

07:28.433 --> 07:31.433
- HE WAS SO EXCITED TO DO THAT
FOR HIS LITTLE BROTHER.

07:31.433 --> 07:33.567
HE HASN'T TALKED
ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE.

07:33.567 --> 07:34.700
ISN'T THAT SWEET?

07:34.700 --> 07:37.800
YOU KNOW, RAYMOND'S LOVED
THAT MUHAMMAD ALI

07:37.800 --> 07:39.133
EVER SINCE I CAN REMEMBER.

07:39.133 --> 07:41.700
- I THREW IT OUT.
- WHAT?

07:41.700 --> 07:43.700
- I THREW THE LETTER OUT.

07:43.700 --> 07:47.767
- OH, MY GOD!
WHY WOULD YOU DO SUCH A THING?

07:47.767 --> 07:49.900
- I WAS STRAIGHTENING UP.

07:49.900 --> 07:52.633
- NO, REALLY.
WHY?

07:54.900 --> 07:56.233
- I DON'T KNOW,
I DON'T KNOW.

07:56.233 --> 07:58.233
IT WAS LIKE I WAS
LOOKING FOR THIS COUPON

07:58.233 --> 08:00.433
AND THAT DRAWER
WAS FULL OF JUNK

08:00.433 --> 08:02.133
AND I WAS DISTRACTED
ON THE PHONE,

08:02.133 --> 08:04.067
SO I EMPTIED IT
AND I STOMPED ON IT

08:04.067 --> 08:06.367
AND I THREW IT ON
THE GARBAGE TRUCK MYSELF.

08:06.367 --> 08:08.533
- OH, DEAR.

08:08.533 --> 08:11.767
WHAT WAS THE COUPON FOR?

08:11.767 --> 08:13.333
- A FACIAL.

08:13.333 --> 08:15.767
- VANITY, VANITY, VANITY.

08:15.767 --> 08:19.567
- IT WASN'T FOR ME.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.733
- YOU KNOW,
ROBERT'S GONNA BE UPSET TOO.

08:21.733 --> 08:24.000
- I KNOW.

08:25.167 --> 08:26.867
- MA, I'M LOOKIN' FOR ROBERT.

08:26.867 --> 08:29.367
WHERE'S ROBERT? ROBERT!

08:29.367 --> 08:31.200
I'M LOOKING FOR THIS--
THIS LETTER.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.533
IT WAS IN A WHITE ENVELOPE.

08:32.533 --> 08:35.233
- RAY.
- WHAT?

08:35.233 --> 08:36.800
- THERE'S SOMETHING
I GOTTA TELL YOU.

08:36.800 --> 08:38.333
- WHAT?

08:38.333 --> 08:40.967

08:40.967 --> 08:43.167
- WHAT?

08:43.167 --> 08:45.167
- I KNOW, RAYMOND,
I AM SORRY.

08:45.167 --> 08:46.900
I DIDN'T REALIZE
WHAT I WAS DOING

08:46.900 --> 08:48.133
UNTIL DEBRA SAID TO ME

08:48.133 --> 08:50.033
THAT IT WAS IN THE DRAWER
AND I--

08:50.033 --> 08:52.033
- YOU THREW IT OUT?

08:52.033 --> 08:53.767
I GOTTA GET TO THE TRASH!

08:53.767 --> 08:55.733
- THE TRUCK CAME ALREADY.

08:55.733 --> 08:57.233
- OHHH!

08:58.867 --> 09:00.267
MUHAMMAD!

09:03.300 --> 09:05.067
MUHAMMAD!

09:06.667 --> 09:08.200
- I--I KNOW, I'M SORRY.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.533
I MEAN, THERE WAS
SO MUCH STUFF IN THE DRAWER

09:10.533 --> 09:12.000
AND I WAS JUST
TRYING TO CLEAN UP.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.567
AND--AND I KNOW
I SHOULDN'T BE DOING THAT.

09:14.567 --> 09:16.700
RIGHT, DEBRA?

09:16.700 --> 09:19.333
- YES!

09:19.333 --> 09:21.033
YES! HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE I TOLD YOU

09:21.033 --> 09:23.233
WE CAN CLEAN OUR HOUSE
OURSELVES?

09:25.833 --> 09:27.633
- I KNOW.
I DON'T LISTEN.

09:27.633 --> 09:29.067
- I GUESS YOU DON'T.

09:32.033 --> 09:35.033
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT YOU'VE DONE?

09:35.033 --> 09:37.300
- OH, I APOLOGIZE, RAYMOND.

09:37.300 --> 09:39.500
IT BREAKS MY HEART
TO HURT YOU.

09:39.500 --> 09:42.967
AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING--
IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN...

09:42.967 --> 09:46.167
- OH, NO!
OH, NO, NO, YOU DON'T! NO!

09:46.167 --> 09:47.467
NO, NO.
YOU DON'T CRY!

09:47.467 --> 09:50.500
I CRY!

09:50.500 --> 09:52.333
YOU COME UNINVITED
INTO MY HOUSE

09:52.333 --> 09:54.167
AND YOU GO
INTO A PRIVATE DRAWER

09:54.167 --> 09:56.300
AND YOU THROW OUT
THE BEST THING

09:56.300 --> 09:58.933
THAT'S HAPPENED TO ME IN YEARS!

09:58.933 --> 10:00.867
- [sobbing]

10:00.867 --> 10:03.133
- IT'S AT THE DUMP, MA!

10:04.600 --> 10:06.500
IT'S AT THE DUMP!

10:09.967 --> 10:12.167
- THERE WE GO.

10:20.967 --> 10:22.667
- MARIE.

10:22.667 --> 10:24.033
WHAT...

10:24.033 --> 10:25.667
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

10:25.667 --> 10:28.967
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SAY ANYTHING, DEAR.

10:28.967 --> 10:30.600
- THANK YOU.

10:30.600 --> 10:32.433
- IT WAS NOTHING.

10:32.433 --> 10:35.500
WHO KNOWS, SOMEDAY I MAY
ASK YOU FOR A FAVOR.

10:35.500 --> 10:37.033
- OH, OF COURSE.

10:37.033 --> 10:38.333
OF COURSE,
I WILL DO ANYTHING.

10:38.333 --> 10:42.067
- GOOD.
WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING.

10:43.833 --> 10:45.733
LET'S HAVE SOME CAKE.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.600
- GOOD MORNING.
- HEY, MARIE.

10:50.600 --> 10:51.867
- HOW ARE THINGS, DEAR?

10:51.867 --> 10:53.500
- WELL, BETTER.

10:53.500 --> 10:54.633
IT'S BEEN A WEEK,

10:54.633 --> 10:58.933
SO RAY'S NOT YELLING AT YOU
IN HIS SLEEP ANYMORE.

10:58.933 --> 11:01.100
- THAT'S NICE.

11:01.100 --> 11:04.833
LISTEN, I'M SURE
YOU'VE NOTICED OVER THE YEARS

11:04.833 --> 11:07.400
THAT FRANK DRESSES
LIKE A DERELICT.

11:10.500 --> 11:14.433
WELL, I HAVE FINALLY FIGURED OUT
HOW TO REMEDY THAT SITUATION.

11:14.433 --> 11:15.733
- MARIE!

11:15.733 --> 11:17.733
- OH, THERE HE IS.

11:17.733 --> 11:18.800
NOW, REMEMBER I SAID

11:18.800 --> 11:20.833
SOMEDAY I MIGHT
ASK YOU FOR A FAVOR?

11:20.833 --> 11:23.633
- MARIE!
- THAT DAY HAS COME.

11:33.233 --> 11:38.067
- WHERE THE HELL
ARE ALL MY CLOTHES?

11:38.067 --> 11:42.700
- DEBRA TOOK THEM.

11:42.700 --> 11:44.667
- WHY WOULD YOU
TAKE MY CLOTHES?

11:44.667 --> 11:49.100
- I'M REALLY VERY
UPSET WITH YOU, DEBRA.

11:49.100 --> 11:51.300
- I'M...SORRY, FRANK.

11:51.300 --> 11:56.700
- WHERE THE HELL ARE THEY?

11:56.700 --> 12:00.300
- WELL, DEBRA SAID
SHE WAS GONNA HAVE THEM CLEANED.

12:00.300 --> 12:03.200
WHY DON'T YOU TELL HIM
HOW YOU WERE OVER AT OUR HOUSE

12:03.200 --> 12:05.700
AND THE BOY
CAME TO THE DOOR?

12:05.700 --> 12:08.700
- A BOY CAME TO THE DOOR.

12:15.133 --> 12:17.300
- AND HE SAID HE WAS WITH
A NEW DRY CLEANERS

12:17.300 --> 12:19.333
AND THAT HE WAS TRYING
TO MAKE SOME MONEY FOR COLLEGE

12:19.333 --> 12:23.833
AND DEBRA DECIDED
TO HELP HIM OUT.

12:23.833 --> 12:26.167
- HE WAS GOING DOOR TO DOOR?

12:26.167 --> 12:31.100
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!

12:31.100 --> 12:33.733
- IT SOUNDS A LITTLE FISHY
TO ME, DEBRA.

12:37.933 --> 12:40.300
- I KNOW, BUT IT'S TRUE.

12:40.300 --> 12:41.867
- AND YOU GAVE HIM MY CLOTHES.

12:41.867 --> 12:43.767
WELL, GET 'EM BACK!

12:43.767 --> 12:47.467
- I DON'T KNOW IF SHE CAN.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.500
DEBRA, WHY DON'T YOU TELL HIM
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU

12:49.500 --> 12:53.667
CALLED THE NUMBER
THE BOY GAVE YOU?

12:53.667 --> 12:56.900
- YES, RIGHT.
NOBODY ANSWERED.

12:56.900 --> 12:58.667
- WAIT A MINUTE,
I KNOW WHAT THIS IS.

12:58.667 --> 13:01.533
THIS IS A SCAM!

13:01.533 --> 13:05.300
THAT PUNK KID'S OUT THERE
SELLING MY STUFF!

13:05.300 --> 13:08.600
- I'M SURE
HE'LL MAKE A FORTUNE.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.400
- WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

13:10.400 --> 13:11.400
- I DON'T KNOW.

13:11.400 --> 13:13.333
I'M AN IDIOT.
I'M SORRY, FRANK.

13:13.333 --> 13:18.000
- SORRY'S NOT GONNA
KEEP THE SNOW OFF MY ASS!

13:18.000 --> 13:19.833
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
DON'T WORRY, FRANK.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.667
I'LL HELP YOU GET NEW CLOTHES.

13:21.667 --> 13:23.067
IN FACT, I HAVE AN OUTFIT

13:23.067 --> 13:25.000
THAT I WAS GONNA GIVE YOU
TO WEAR FOR EASTER.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.867
I'LL LET YOU WEAR IT TODAY.

13:26.867 --> 13:28.067
- WELL, BRING IT OVER HERE!

13:28.067 --> 13:30.000
I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK
OUT THERE LIKE THIS.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.400
THE MAILMAN ALREADY
MADE A CRACK ABOUT MY LEGS.

13:36.567 --> 13:38.367
LOOK WHAT YOU DID!

13:38.367 --> 13:40.133
I HATE THE CLOTHES
SHE BUYS ME!

13:40.133 --> 13:44.567
I ALWAYS END UP LOOKIN'
LIKE A DANDY OR A FRENCHMAN!

13:44.567 --> 13:46.133
- I'M SO SORRY, FRANK.

13:46.133 --> 13:48.300
BUT IT COULD BE FUN
TO BUY NEW CLOTHES.

13:48.300 --> 13:50.600
SOMETIMES IT'S KINDA COOL
TO CHANGE YOUR LOOK.

13:50.600 --> 13:53.633
- YOU HATE ME, DON'T YOU?

13:53.633 --> 13:55.233
- [sighs]

13:55.233 --> 13:56.967
ALL RIGHT, FRANK, LISTEN.

13:56.967 --> 13:58.633
YOU'VE ALWAYS
BEEN HONEST WITH ME,

13:58.633 --> 14:01.467
SO THERE'S SOMETHING
I GOTTA TELL YOU.

14:01.467 --> 14:03.167
- WHAT?

14:03.167 --> 14:05.233
- MARIE'S THE ONE THAT
GOT RID OF YOUR CLOTHES.

14:05.233 --> 14:06.100
- WHAT?

14:06.100 --> 14:08.400
- YOU CAN'T TELL HER
I TOLD YOU.

14:08.400 --> 14:09.400
- I KNEW IT!

14:09.400 --> 14:11.933
THAT STORY HAD MARIE'S STINK
ALL OVER IT!

14:11.933 --> 14:14.367
WHY DID YOU COVER FOR HER?

14:14.367 --> 14:15.967
- SHE HELPED ME OUT
WITH SOMETHING

14:15.967 --> 14:17.733
AND I OWED HER A FAVOR.

14:17.733 --> 14:19.433
- OKAY, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

14:19.433 --> 14:21.967
I'M GONNA GO STRANGLE A WOMAN
WITH HER OWN BATHROBE.

14:21.967 --> 14:24.533
- NO, NO, NO! NO!
NO. NO, NO!

14:24.533 --> 14:25.900
YOU CAN'T STRANGLE HER

14:25.900 --> 14:27.567
BECAUSE THEN SHE'LL KNOW
I TOLD YOU,

14:27.567 --> 14:29.933
AND THEN SHE'LL TELL--
UNLESS YOU REALLY STRANGLE HER.

14:29.933 --> 14:31.867
NO--

14:31.867 --> 14:35.567
DON'T DO THAT.

14:35.567 --> 14:36.500
- SO WHAT?

14:36.500 --> 14:38.367
I'M JUST SUPPOSED
TO PUT UP WITH HER CRAP?

14:38.367 --> 14:42.500
- I'LL...I'LL OWE YOU ONE.

14:42.500 --> 14:45.300
- BOY, SHE MUST REALLY
HAVE THE GOODS ON YOU, HUH?

14:47.700 --> 14:50.833
- OKAY, HERE WE GO.

14:50.833 --> 14:53.200
- I'M VERY UPSET
WITH YOU, DEBRA.

14:53.200 --> 14:55.833
- I'M SORRY, FRANK.
I'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE NOW.

14:55.833 --> 15:00.667
- YES.
I CAN'T LOOK AT YOU ANYMORE.

15:03.900 --> 15:06.267
OH, JEEZALOO!

15:14.167 --> 15:15.567
- FRANK,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:15.567 --> 15:17.300
- REMEMBER HOW YOU OWE ME?

15:17.300 --> 15:20.300
- MARIE'S NOT IN THERE,
IS SHE?

15:22.733 --> 15:24.600
- NO, I JUST DUG UP
A ROSE BUSH.

15:24.600 --> 15:25.567
- WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

15:25.567 --> 15:27.933
- IT WAS IN THE SWING ZONE
OF MY HAMMOCK.

15:27.933 --> 15:30.967
- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
- TAKE THE RAP.

15:30.967 --> 15:32.967
- WHAT? FRANK.

15:32.967 --> 15:34.033
WHAT ARE YOU--

15:34.033 --> 15:35.800
- PUT THESE ON.
- WAIT A MINUTE.

15:35.800 --> 15:36.933
- FRANK.

15:36.933 --> 15:38.667
- AAAH!
- AAAH!

15:38.667 --> 15:42.167
- WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
YOUR DINNER'S READY.

15:42.167 --> 15:43.600
WHAT'S ALL THAT?

15:43.600 --> 15:47.600
- I WAS JUST ABOUT TO
ASK DEBRA THE SAME THING.

15:47.600 --> 15:50.767
DEBRA, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

15:50.767 --> 15:51.833
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:51.833 --> 15:53.367
- DEBRA'S BEEN UP TO SOMETHING,

15:53.367 --> 15:55.700
AND I, FOR ONE,
DON'T LIKE THE LOOKS OF IT.

15:59.300 --> 16:00.567
- I CAN'T DO THIS.
I CAN'T.

16:00.567 --> 16:01.600
RAY, LISTEN.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.767
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
THIS WHEN IT HAPPENED.

16:03.767 --> 16:07.333
I'M THE ONE WHO THREW OUT
YOUR MUHAMMAD ALI LETTER.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.000
- WHAT?

16:09.000 --> 16:11.333
- YEAH, I THREW IT OUT
BY ACCIDENT,

16:11.333 --> 16:14.067
AND THEN I PANICKED,
AND MARIE TOOK THE BLAME FOR ME.

16:15.033 --> 16:17.033
- AND THEN YOU BURIED IT?

16:23.433 --> 16:25.733
- IT WAS YOU?

16:25.733 --> 16:27.167
OH, MY GOD,
I'M SORRY, MA.

16:27.167 --> 16:28.300
I'VE BEEN GIVING YOU

16:28.300 --> 16:30.100
THE SILENT TREATMENT
ALL WEEK.

16:30.100 --> 16:32.600
- YOU HAVE?

16:41.267 --> 16:42.500
- I--I--

16:42.500 --> 16:45.700
I'M SORRY, RAY.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

16:45.700 --> 16:47.433
- WELL...

16:47.433 --> 16:51.733
I CAN'T BELIEVE I LET YOU
MAKE LOVE TO ME ALL WEEK.

16:55.067 --> 16:57.033
- AND THEN SHE DUG UP
MARIE'S NICE ROSE BUSH!

16:57.033 --> 16:59.967
SHE'S GOTTA BE STOPPED!

16:59.967 --> 17:01.933
- MY ROSES!

17:01.933 --> 17:04.267
OH, YOU HORRIBLE BRUTE!

17:04.267 --> 17:06.567
- IT WASN'T ME,
IT WAS DEBRA!

17:06.567 --> 17:09.033
DEBRA, YOU'RE ON.

17:09.033 --> 17:11.700
- STOP IT!
ADMIT IT WAS YOU!

17:11.700 --> 17:14.167
- I'LL ADMIT IT WHEN YOU TELL ME
WHAT YOU DID WITH MY CLOTHES!

17:14.167 --> 17:15.467
- THEY'RE GONE.
- WHERE ARE THEY?

17:15.467 --> 17:17.400
- I DROPPED THEM OFF
AT A HOMELESS SHELTER,

17:17.400 --> 17:20.267
AND THEY'RE BEING USED
TO WASH CARS!

17:22.867 --> 17:25.400
- MARIE, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:25.400 --> 17:28.167
WHY WOULD YOU TAKE THE BLAME
FOR SOMETHING THAT DEBRA DID?

17:28.167 --> 17:31.500
- APPARENTLY
FOR NO GOOD REASON!

17:31.500 --> 17:33.267
- NO, I SEE HOW
HER SICK MIND WORKS.

17:33.267 --> 17:34.867
SHE WANTED DEBRA ON THE HOOK

17:34.867 --> 17:36.267
SO SHE COULD GET RID
OF MY CLOTHES

17:36.267 --> 17:39.067
AND DRESS ME UP LIKE
FRUITY PIERRE!

17:40.300 --> 17:43.300
- YOU HAPPY WITH YOURSELF? HUH?

17:43.300 --> 17:46.700
GETTIN' INTO BUSINESS
WITH THIS ONE?

17:48.967 --> 17:52.533
- OH, YOU'RE ONE TO TALK,
RAYMOND.

17:52.533 --> 17:54.967
DEBRA, THAT'S
A BEAUTIFUL NECKLACE.

17:54.967 --> 17:58.167
WHERE DID YOU GET IT FROM,
RAYMOND?

18:00.400 --> 18:04.500
- WELL...

18:04.500 --> 18:06.500
WELL, WHEREVER I GOT IT FROM,
I'M GONNA RETURN IT,

18:06.500 --> 18:08.833
'CAUSE HER BEAUTY
OVERWHELMS IT.

18:08.833 --> 18:11.467
ALL RIGHT, WHADDYA SAY
WE GET THIS BUSH IN THE GROUND?

18:11.467 --> 18:12.767
LET'S GO.

18:12.767 --> 18:15.167
- YOU DIDN'T
BUY THIS NECKLACE?

18:15.167 --> 18:17.033
YOU HAD YOUR MOTHER DO IT?

18:17.033 --> 18:20.533
YOU COULDN'T BUY ME
A BIRTHDAY GIFT ON YOUR OWN?

18:20.533 --> 18:23.167
- WELL, I'M SURE HE WOULD
HAVE BOUGHT IT HIMSELF

18:23.167 --> 18:26.233
IF HE HAD
REMEMBERED YOUR BIRTHDAY.

18:27.533 --> 18:29.733
- YOU STILL--

18:29.733 --> 18:31.833
[mouths words]

18:31.833 --> 18:35.467
YOU STILL NEED YOUR MOTHER
TO TELL YOU WHEN MY BIRTHDAY IS?

18:35.467 --> 18:37.300
- YOU STILL NEED MY MOTHER
TO COVER FOR YOU

18:37.300 --> 18:40.067
WHEN YOU DESTROY MY LETTERS
FROM MUHAMMAD ALI?

18:40.067 --> 18:42.867
- I DON'T NEED
YOUR MOTHER.

18:42.867 --> 18:44.200
- WHO ARE YOU KIDDING?

18:44.200 --> 18:46.567
ANYTIME YOU WANT TO
GET OUT OF GOING ANYWHERE,

18:46.567 --> 18:49.467
WHO TELLS PEOPLE
THAT YOU HAVE PHLEBITIS?

18:53.100 --> 18:54.533
- WAIT A MINUTE.

18:54.533 --> 18:56.700
YOU DIDN'T COME
TO OUR REHEARSAL DINNER

18:56.700 --> 19:01.300
BECAUSE YOU HAD PHLEBITIS.

19:01.300 --> 19:02.333
- MARIE?

19:02.333 --> 19:05.100
- NO, NO.
YOU DUG UP MY ROSE BUSH.

19:05.100 --> 19:08.600
THAT'S THE LAST PHLEBITIS
YOU GET FROM ME.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.133
- WOW, MARIE.

19:10.133 --> 19:12.767
SEEMS LIKE YOU
COVER FOR EVERYBODY.

19:12.767 --> 19:15.567
- THAT'S WHAT A MOTHER DOES.

19:15.567 --> 19:18.367
- YEAH, A MOTHER WHO WANTS
TO CONTROL EVERYBODY.

19:18.367 --> 19:20.767
YOU GET SOMETHIN' ON EVERYBODY,
AND THEN YOU USE IT.

19:20.767 --> 19:22.000
- YEAH.

19:22.000 --> 19:28.600
- IS THAT WHAT
A MOTHER DOES?

19:28.600 --> 19:30.200
- EXCUSE ME.

19:30.200 --> 19:33.767
DID I ASK YOU ALL TO COME TO ME
AND ASK FOR THESE FAVORS?

19:33.767 --> 19:36.867
YOU COME TO ME BECAUSE
YOU KNOW THAT I CAN DELIVER.

19:36.867 --> 19:38.033
GO OUT ON THE STREET

19:38.033 --> 19:43.100
AND ASK FOR THOSE FAVORS
AND SEE WHAT YOU GET.

19:43.100 --> 19:44.933
AND SO, YES.

19:44.933 --> 19:47.633
MAYBE SOMETIMES I ASK
FOR A FAVOR IN RETURN,

19:47.633 --> 19:48.967
ONCE IN A BLUE MOON.

19:48.967 --> 19:52.000
AND YOU CALL THAT CONTROLLING?

19:52.000 --> 19:54.700
I CALL THAT A FAMILY.

19:57.133 --> 19:59.433
- A MAFIA FAMILY.

20:07.967 --> 20:10.967
- IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK, AMY?

20:10.967 --> 20:13.967
- I'M SORRY.

20:13.967 --> 20:16.700
- NO, NO, NO...

20:16.700 --> 20:18.533
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:18.533 --> 20:22.067
MAYBE IT'S WRONG FOR ME
TO HAVE ALL THESE SECRETS.

20:22.067 --> 20:24.433
I MEAN, THE TRUTH IS,
IT'S A BURDEN TO HOLD ON

20:24.433 --> 20:27.133
TO ALL THESE THINGS
THAT I KNOW ABOUT EVERYONE.

20:27.133 --> 20:29.367
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST
CLEAR THE AIR RIGHT NOW.

20:29.367 --> 20:31.500
- NO, NO.
- IT'S OKAY.

20:31.500 --> 20:32.600
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

20:32.600 --> 20:35.000
- SILLY. THAT'S SILLY.

20:37.133 --> 20:40.000
- I THOUGHT SO.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.300
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

20:42.300 --> 20:46.167
FRANK HAS SOME DIGGING TO DO.

20:46.167 --> 20:48.500
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GET THOSE NEW CLOTHES DIRTY.

20:48.500 --> 20:52.300
IT'S DARK OUTSIDE, SO YOU
CAN DO IT IN YOUR UNDERWEAR.

20:59.233 --> 21:01.700
- WELL.

21:01.700 --> 21:04.200
- YOU LEARNED SOMETHING
TONIGHT, DIDN'T YOU?

21:04.200 --> 21:07.500
- YEP.
- DON'T TOUCH MY STUFF.

21:20.833 --> 21:23.733
- [humming]

21:29.567 --> 21:33.433
- DIDN'T MARIE GET HIS CLOTHES
BACK FROM THE SHELTER?

21:33.433 --> 21:36.100
- YEAH.

21:39.400 --> 21:42.333
WE'RE ALL A LITTLE NERVOUS.

21:45.100 --> 21:47.767
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
START LOCKING YOUR CLOSET.
