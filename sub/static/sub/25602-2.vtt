00:00.142 --> 00:02.171
Previously on "Killjoys"...

00:02.174 --> 00:04.233
- What did they do to me?
- It worked.

00:04.236 --> 00:06.645
- Moment of truth.
- There's Daddy.

00:06.648 --> 00:08.405
- Now meet Mommy.
- Dutch.

00:08.408 --> 00:09.899
Well, that's what the RAC database

00:09.902 --> 00:11.807
thought at first, but
we looked more closely.

00:11.810 --> 00:12.809
Hello, Aneela.

00:16.951 --> 00:19.039
The humans have built a distortion field

00:19.042 --> 00:21.385
that prevents our
ships from approaching.

00:21.387 --> 00:23.820
- Then find the source.
- We already have.

00:25.024 --> 00:26.890
They found us!

00:26.892 --> 00:28.929
Fall back!

00:28.932 --> 00:30.531
- We're being boarded.
- If you're gonna

00:30.534 --> 00:33.215
take down Aneela, now
would be a good time.

00:33.218 --> 00:34.564
Dutch!

00:34.566 --> 00:36.299
I'm sorry.

00:36.301 --> 00:39.351
- Ah!
- What the hells was that?

00:39.354 --> 00:40.654
I think the Lady must
be trying to get out.

00:40.656 --> 00:41.593
Call off the war.

00:41.596 --> 00:43.406
Connect to the Hullen hive mind.

00:48.914 --> 00:50.748
Human, human, I'm totally human!

00:51.750 --> 00:54.168
The Black Root ships are
swarming the Necropolis.

00:54.171 --> 00:55.895
Gotta sever the shaft from both ends.

00:55.898 --> 00:57.267
You'll be floating in space.

00:57.270 --> 00:58.637
That's a risk we gotta take.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.074

01:17.209 --> 01:18.542
What are the odds

01:18.544 --> 01:20.700
there's a decent spa around here?

01:20.703 --> 01:22.498
Why are we still with her?
We should have left her

01:22.500 --> 01:24.059
on the elevator to fend for herself.

01:24.062 --> 01:26.778
Well, you know what they say:
"The pregnant enemy of my enemy

01:26.781 --> 01:29.485
is my alien baby mama."

01:29.488 --> 01:31.154
Oh, yeah, can I get that on a mug?

01:31.156 --> 01:32.956
You're no catch, limp-lungs.

01:32.958 --> 01:34.791
My fetus is walking faster than you.

01:34.793 --> 01:35.742
I'm still injured,

01:35.745 --> 01:37.578
thanks to your
plasma-huffing girlfriend.

01:37.581 --> 01:40.140
Hey! If I have to
separate you two again,

01:40.143 --> 01:42.111
I will turn this hike around.

01:43.668 --> 01:45.969
Walk.

01:45.971 --> 01:48.405
Much as I appreciate
the fresh air and cardio,

01:48.407 --> 01:50.673
- what are we even looking for?
- Well, some sign

01:50.675 --> 01:52.642
of where the hells we are would be nice.

01:52.644 --> 01:54.010
Unless someone replaced our moons,

01:54.012 --> 01:55.158
we're not in the Quad anymore.

01:55.160 --> 01:56.980
We need to find a
transport out of here, fast.

01:56.982 --> 01:59.349
I just hope to shit we
aren't alone out here.

01:59.351 --> 02:00.585
- We aren't.
- Oh,

02:00.588 --> 02:03.067
has your very special
baby made you psychic?

02:03.070 --> 02:05.555
No, you moron. But I'm
pregnant, not blind.

02:18.236 --> 02:19.335
Hey there!

02:19.338 --> 02:20.704
Was that you guys that crashed

02:20.707 --> 02:23.007
- way up there on the flats?
- Yeah.

02:23.010 --> 02:25.375
Sure could use a lift
back to civilization.

02:25.378 --> 02:26.640
Yeah, yeah, good deal.

02:26.643 --> 02:28.911
There's a depot, like, five miles east.

02:28.914 --> 02:31.181
We could give you a ride, but, uh...

02:33.542 --> 02:35.585
Why don't we take
your valuables instead?

02:35.587 --> 02:37.632
Drop your guns, pretty boys,

02:37.635 --> 02:40.437
or your pregnant girlfriend
gets a belly full of lead.

02:42.127 --> 02:43.660
Man...

02:43.662 --> 02:45.895
the universe is just full of assholes.

02:45.897 --> 02:48.264
Yeah, it really is a problem.

02:56.268 --> 02:58.023
Decent massage.

02:58.026 --> 03:00.794
You do pedicures too?

03:00.797 --> 03:03.898
Jackpot, boys. She's got jewels.

03:03.901 --> 03:06.082
Oh, that's not for you, little girl.

03:06.084 --> 03:07.684
Give it.

03:07.686 --> 03:08.719
Take it.

03:10.255 --> 03:11.488
With pleasure.

03:13.391 --> 03:14.858
Go, go, go, go, go!

03:14.860 --> 03:16.468
Get 'em!

03:17.707 --> 03:20.062
- Punch it! Go!
- Go, go!

03:23.735 --> 03:27.270
Well, the locals seem nice.

03:27.272 --> 03:30.707
See? Delle Seyah does
come in handy, John.

03:32.944 --> 03:34.310
John!

03:34.312 --> 03:36.531
Must be his punctured lung.

03:36.534 --> 03:38.431
We need to find help.

03:38.434 --> 03:40.283
From where?

03:59.138 --> 04:03.633
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

04:11.349 --> 04:13.082
We need a doctor.

04:13.084 --> 04:14.618
Wait your turn.

04:17.689 --> 04:20.390
Get us a doctor, or
I'll get you a mortician.

04:20.392 --> 04:21.858
They ain't comin' till morning.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.824
- Don't wet your pants.
- We have medical supplies

04:23.827 --> 04:25.694
in the back. I'll get them.

04:27.332 --> 04:29.599
That's convenient. What is this place?

04:29.601 --> 04:31.468
Just another shithole.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.837
- Jonesy!
- Out! Everybody out.

04:34.839 --> 04:35.972
- Okay, okay.
- See that?

04:35.974 --> 04:37.574
Okay.

04:37.576 --> 04:39.442
Just stay with me, okay?

04:40.845 --> 04:42.281
Okay.

04:42.347 --> 04:44.013
Okay.

04:44.015 --> 04:46.149
Really?

04:46.151 --> 04:47.844
What? Magic baby, remember?

04:47.847 --> 04:49.719
And watching him die is
less fun than I hoped.

04:49.721 --> 04:51.688
- Then help!
- What about this?

04:51.690 --> 04:54.023
- Does this help?
- Yes. Shoo.

04:54.025 --> 04:56.025
- Hey, you want the knife?
- Mm.

04:56.027 --> 04:59.000
No? Straw. Want the straw?

04:59.003 --> 05:00.031
Oh, for God's sake.

05:00.034 --> 05:01.738
It's like watching you
train a very stupid dog.

05:01.740 --> 05:03.807
Here. He means this.

05:10.275 --> 05:12.308
Easy! He's not a pincushion!

05:12.310 --> 05:14.877
Yeah, and I'm not a doctor.

05:14.879 --> 05:16.554
Oh, shit, we made it worse.

05:16.557 --> 05:19.191
I'm so sorry, buddy. Hey, hey.

05:19.194 --> 05:20.351
We're gonna get the doctor,

05:20.354 --> 05:21.601
he's gonna fix you, and then

05:21.604 --> 05:22.971
we're gonna find our
way back home, okay?

05:22.973 --> 05:25.807
We left in the middle of a war, Jaqobis.

05:25.810 --> 05:28.323
For all we know, there
is no home to go back to.

05:53.985 --> 05:55.852
Hey!

05:55.854 --> 05:58.121
One of these days, I
am going to shoot you.

05:58.123 --> 06:00.356
The mess hall in 35 is almost bare.

06:00.358 --> 06:02.125
We've already picked over most of it.

06:04.195 --> 06:05.496
Uh...

06:08.566 --> 06:10.000
Man, I hate plums.

06:10.003 --> 06:13.400
They didn't have any, like,
peaches or anything like that?

06:13.403 --> 06:15.405
Which is what the old
Pip would have said,

06:15.407 --> 06:17.473
because he sucked.

06:17.475 --> 06:20.343
Screw that guy. I love
plums. Plums are great.

06:20.345 --> 06:21.744
I snuck into engineering,

06:21.746 --> 06:24.113
duped the master codes in Dock 18,

06:24.115 --> 06:26.549
and if we can access the flight decks,

06:26.551 --> 06:28.351
maybe we can finally get out of here.

06:28.353 --> 06:30.286
It works.

06:30.288 --> 06:32.822
It works! We're frickin' geniuses!

06:32.824 --> 06:35.258
Any changes with our new landlords?

07:00.985 --> 07:02.640
See, they move!

07:04.203 --> 07:06.456
I still think it's just
residual motor instincts,

07:06.458 --> 07:08.991
self-defense motions triggered
by a sense of contact.

07:08.993 --> 07:10.760
Okay, there is literally no way

07:10.762 --> 07:12.395
you could possibly know that.

07:12.397 --> 07:14.597
There is one way.

07:14.599 --> 07:17.333
- And we're ready.
- To go out there?

07:17.335 --> 07:19.168
Zeph, we... we could have

07:19.170 --> 07:21.838
a full, happy life in here.

07:21.840 --> 07:24.173
- In a one-room lab?
- Do you see a one-room lab?

07:24.175 --> 07:28.562
Because I see a mansion
of possibilities.

07:28.565 --> 07:30.012
What happens when we run out of food

07:30.015 --> 07:31.814
or the generator dies?

07:31.816 --> 07:33.149
Pip...

07:33.151 --> 07:35.218
it's time.

07:35.220 --> 07:36.619
We get to the docking bay,

07:36.621 --> 07:38.523
use this to hot-wire a Black Root ship,

07:38.526 --> 07:40.423
and we sneak inside the Armada.

07:40.425 --> 07:42.211
Yeah, I know it's... It's a good plan.

07:42.214 --> 07:44.733
It just sounds kind of...

07:44.736 --> 07:46.362
death-y.

07:46.364 --> 07:49.365
Look, Team Awesome Force
taught me one thing.

07:49.367 --> 07:52.301
- Tight pants are best pants?
- No.

07:52.303 --> 07:53.898
Heroes gonna hero.

07:53.901 --> 07:55.468
They risked their lives for us.

07:55.471 --> 07:58.538
It's time we risk ours
to go regroup with them.

08:03.581 --> 08:05.548
Ready?

08:08.987 --> 08:10.853
I'm a little rusty at hot-wiring ships,

08:10.855 --> 08:11.888
just so you know.

08:17.395 --> 08:19.328
Pacing a hole in the
floor won't fix anything.

08:19.330 --> 08:20.812
Nothing we can do will fix anything.

08:20.815 --> 08:22.554
That's the problem, and I hate it.

08:22.557 --> 08:24.700
I've been trying to reach
Aneela and her crew with this

08:24.702 --> 08:26.002
since we left.

08:26.004 --> 08:28.571
All I get is silence.

08:28.573 --> 08:31.674
Here.

08:31.676 --> 08:34.376
I think we have just
enough plasma for John.

08:34.379 --> 08:35.844
Enough to what?

08:35.847 --> 08:37.613
To save him.

08:37.616 --> 08:39.015
No.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.808
- Give me another way.
- Any other way.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.945
We're not turning my
little brother Hullen.

08:42.948 --> 08:44.676
They said the doctor's
coming tomorrow...

08:44.679 --> 08:46.578
His lips... you saw them. They're blue.

08:46.581 --> 08:48.347
He won't last that long.

08:48.350 --> 08:49.987
Look, once we get off this rock,

08:49.990 --> 08:51.823
you can find a way to cleanse him.

08:51.826 --> 08:54.297
- You don't know that.
- I know I can't bring him back

08:54.299 --> 08:55.731
once he's dead.

08:55.733 --> 08:58.701
This is a limited-time offer, Killjoy.

08:58.703 --> 09:00.603
We'll never find Dutch
or Aneela without him.

09:00.605 --> 09:01.939
You think that's what he'd want?

09:06.244 --> 09:08.778
What do we need?

09:08.780 --> 09:10.713
Well, medical supplies.

09:10.715 --> 09:12.682
A sterile environment would be swell.

09:12.684 --> 09:14.351
Something like a clinic?

09:16.554 --> 09:18.855
Hey! You can't go in there!

09:18.857 --> 09:19.990
Disagree.

09:27.999 --> 09:29.665
- You ready?
- You understand I've only

09:29.667 --> 09:31.334
done this once and never
with so little plasma.

09:31.336 --> 09:33.069
These are imperfect
conditions and unusual tools.

09:33.071 --> 09:35.273
I'm not going to blame you.

09:35.276 --> 09:36.943
Hey, John, you don't have to do this

09:36.946 --> 09:40.547
- if you don't want to.
- Do it.

09:40.550 --> 09:42.879
Dutch.

09:47.085 --> 09:48.375
Okay, turn him over.

09:48.378 --> 09:49.944
And hold him tight.

09:49.947 --> 09:52.828
I have to inject it into
the base of his brain stem.

10:06.838 --> 10:08.471
Now what?

10:08.473 --> 10:10.006
We wait.

10:10.008 --> 10:12.608
- You still have that gun?
- Yeah, why?

10:12.610 --> 10:13.943
Keep it close.

10:13.945 --> 10:15.511
I told you, I've never Hullenized anyone

10:15.513 --> 10:17.344
with so little plasma.

10:17.347 --> 10:19.447
We don't know what it could do to him.

10:19.450 --> 10:21.517
I'll take first watch.

10:28.826 --> 10:31.594
Hold your fire. That's one of ours.

10:31.596 --> 10:34.063
- Welcome to Camp Human!
- I don't understand.

10:34.065 --> 10:36.165
How are you all here?
This is so much better

10:36.167 --> 10:38.200
- than getting shot in the face!
- It was close.

10:38.202 --> 10:40.609
We've been tracking your
ship since it left the RAC.

10:40.612 --> 10:42.338
You're lucky we didn't
torch you on entry.

10:42.340 --> 10:43.539
Oh!

10:43.541 --> 10:44.740
Thanks?

10:44.742 --> 10:46.275
Once the Hullen swarmed the RAC,

10:46.277 --> 10:48.277
we figured it was
better to cut our losses.

10:48.279 --> 10:49.633
We killed the power remotely

10:49.636 --> 10:51.837
and locked it down
to buy ourselves time.

10:51.840 --> 10:53.606
What's the status over there?

10:53.609 --> 10:55.442
Uh, creepy?

10:55.445 --> 10:57.520
Hullen guards are
everywhere, but weird ones.

10:57.522 --> 10:59.188
Something's happened to them.

10:59.190 --> 11:01.023
- Something has changed.
- Yeah.

11:01.025 --> 11:03.092
- We know.
- Let's show her.

11:08.232 --> 11:10.199
Holy shit.

11:10.201 --> 11:11.578
Here too?

11:11.581 --> 11:14.070
Just the skeleton crew
Aneela left behind.

11:14.072 --> 11:15.671
We call 'em Dolls.

11:15.673 --> 11:17.073
It was a hell of a job

11:17.075 --> 11:19.709
corralling them into containment sites.

11:19.711 --> 11:21.789
Trapped 'em like bugs in a jar

11:21.792 --> 11:23.562
till we can figure out
what to do with them.

11:23.565 --> 11:26.181
- You should just space them.
- Yeah, let me check on that.

11:26.184 --> 11:27.450
- Can we space them now?
- No.

11:27.452 --> 11:29.018
Fancy says no.

11:29.020 --> 11:31.320
I'm on this whole moral
redemption arc, so...

11:31.322 --> 11:32.359
no can do.

11:32.362 --> 11:34.163
What does John say about them?

11:39.897 --> 11:41.273
Last time I saw them,

11:41.276 --> 11:43.898
John and D'Av were
headed here to save Dutch.

11:43.901 --> 11:47.737
That's why I came. So where are they?

12:00.084 --> 12:01.859
John!

12:01.919 --> 12:03.319
John.

12:07.503 --> 12:10.625
Let go.

12:12.630 --> 12:14.730
What did you do to me, you bastard?

12:14.732 --> 12:16.265
How could you?

12:16.267 --> 12:18.768
You asked me to.

12:23.041 --> 12:25.109
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

12:25.112 --> 12:28.276
I couldn't keep it up, man.
You should see your face!

12:28.279 --> 12:30.246
You're not angry?

12:30.248 --> 12:32.181
For an upgrade of awesome?

12:32.183 --> 12:35.151
Oh! Mwah!

12:35.153 --> 12:36.434
Whoo!

12:38.322 --> 12:39.890
I'm back, bitches.

12:45.671 --> 12:47.137
You look better.

12:47.139 --> 12:48.807
I feel better.

12:50.676 --> 12:51.813
Did you all sleep here?

12:51.816 --> 12:54.177
Because it smells like you slept here.

12:54.180 --> 12:55.813
Go home.

12:55.815 --> 12:58.348
Pardon my brother. He
has an ass for a mouth.

12:58.350 --> 13:01.352
Now, who are you, and
how do we get out of here?

13:02.321 --> 13:04.455
- What?
- I saw his jacket.

13:04.457 --> 13:05.790
Are you really Killjoys?

13:07.359 --> 13:09.126
Yes?

13:09.128 --> 13:10.861
Good. You're hired.

13:10.863 --> 13:13.363
- We're kind of on sabbatical.
- Please.

13:13.365 --> 13:16.533
We're a farming collective. Sharecrop.

13:16.535 --> 13:17.868
We can't make our quota this season,

13:17.870 --> 13:19.220
and the fine for failure is strict.

13:19.222 --> 13:20.904
What kind of strict?

13:20.906 --> 13:23.173
The Overseers come today,
and they'll take everything.

13:23.176 --> 13:24.626
We won't make it through the winter,

13:24.629 --> 13:26.737
- and they won't care.
- Monsters.

13:26.740 --> 13:28.583
But they will respect your badge.

13:28.586 --> 13:30.152
Talk to them. We just want a fair deal.

13:30.155 --> 13:31.688
That's really not what Killjoys do.

13:31.691 --> 13:34.151
- What's in it for us?
- A ship.

13:34.153 --> 13:35.673
I heard you talking in the hallway.

13:35.687 --> 13:37.087
I know that's what you need.

13:37.090 --> 13:39.389
Help us, and we'll help you.

13:39.391 --> 13:40.991
I like your hat.

13:40.993 --> 13:42.826
Can I have it?

13:46.332 --> 13:47.498
Give...

13:47.500 --> 13:50.000
me... your...

13:50.002 --> 13:52.469
hat.

13:52.471 --> 13:53.838
Hey, Johnny?

13:56.629 --> 13:59.177
It's okay. I know you're
not yourself right now.

14:01.520 --> 14:03.087
Why do I want to shoot him, D'Av?

14:04.617 --> 14:07.484
Because I really want to shoot him.

14:07.486 --> 14:10.587
Doesn't mean you have to, though, right?

14:16.162 --> 14:18.629
I'm gonna get us home.

14:18.631 --> 14:21.298
And then we're gonna find Dutch, okay?

14:36.081 --> 14:37.581
- You good?
- Got a little

14:37.583 --> 14:41.185
carried away there, but...

14:41.187 --> 14:42.654
I'm good.

14:44.390 --> 14:45.957
Good.

14:47.793 --> 14:50.361
I'll just hang on to the rifle for now.

14:52.431 --> 14:54.064
From what we can tell from the logs,

14:54.066 --> 14:55.799
the boys left here with Delle Seyah

14:55.801 --> 14:57.401
on one of Aneela's ships.

14:57.403 --> 14:59.403
- Heading where?
- The Necropolis.

14:59.405 --> 15:00.637
They never made it back out.

15:00.639 --> 15:02.005
Then let's go get them.

15:02.007 --> 15:03.273
I was on The Rack this whole time.

15:03.275 --> 15:04.357
Do I look dead to you?

15:04.360 --> 15:06.643
Sweetums, we tried.

15:06.645 --> 15:08.812
The Necroplis was built
to be impenetrable.

15:08.814 --> 15:10.347
No ship can get that close to the sun

15:10.349 --> 15:13.016
without that elevator,
and it's long gone.

15:14.987 --> 15:16.486
Okay, well,

15:16.488 --> 15:19.423
that's a lot of news... none of it good.

15:19.425 --> 15:21.748
I think that maybe we
should give her some space.

15:21.751 --> 15:23.760
In the meantime, you guys can tell me

15:23.762 --> 15:26.096
all about your peach situation, okay?

15:26.098 --> 15:28.966
I can get us in.

15:28.968 --> 15:30.968
- How?
- John and D'Av came here

15:30.970 --> 15:32.636
in one of Khlyen's jump ships.

15:32.638 --> 15:36.051
- Is it still here?
- Yeah, in the docking bay.

15:36.054 --> 15:37.721
Then I can get us inside the Necropolis.

15:37.724 --> 15:40.045
Look, you can't just jump
a ship inside a building.

15:40.048 --> 15:41.311
It's too damn big.

15:41.313 --> 15:42.713
Please stop underestimating me.

15:42.715 --> 15:44.815
I survived nearly alone in the dark

15:44.817 --> 15:46.450
in a station full of
Hullen while building tech

15:46.452 --> 15:49.119
to get me safely off
board. How did you do?

15:49.121 --> 15:50.855
Damn, Zephyr.

15:52.324 --> 15:54.258
- What do you need?
- Khlyen's ship,

15:54.260 --> 15:55.626
the mirror cube that was inside it,

15:55.628 --> 15:57.327
and a Scarback who knows the Necropolis

15:57.329 --> 15:59.296
- inside and out.
- Last part's gonna be tricky.

15:59.298 --> 16:02.366
Scarbacks consider the
Necropolis a tomb now.

16:02.368 --> 16:05.302
They won't help anyone disturb it.

16:09.708 --> 16:12.075
What about an ex-Scarback?

16:14.380 --> 16:16.613
What?

16:16.615 --> 16:18.313
I know people.

16:21.387 --> 16:23.834
You wanna prep me for what the hell else

16:23.837 --> 16:25.602
- he might do?
- I don't know.

16:25.605 --> 16:27.355
He didn't get enough green to make this

16:27.358 --> 16:28.682
an easy transition. He'll be craving it

16:28.684 --> 16:30.712
like a drug until he
gets enough to stabilize.

16:30.715 --> 16:32.529
The process is different for everyone...

16:32.531 --> 16:34.030
Extreme mood swings, needing adrenaline.

16:34.032 --> 16:35.065
And a shot to the head?

16:35.067 --> 16:36.163
Because that's what he's gonna get.

16:36.165 --> 16:38.634
Well, the less fun part is
still coming: neuropurging,

16:38.637 --> 16:40.834
removing all of his
existing emotional bonds.

16:40.837 --> 16:43.307
The more loving a person is,
the harder that part is on you.

16:43.309 --> 16:47.077
Great, because Johnny is
a hug wrapped in a puppy.

16:47.079 --> 16:48.245
You told me you wouldn't blame me.

16:48.247 --> 16:49.646
You said you weren't worried.

16:49.648 --> 16:51.342
I told you what you needed to hear.

16:51.345 --> 16:53.116
We both did what we needed to.

16:53.118 --> 16:55.018
This is what survival
looks like, Jaqobis.

16:55.020 --> 16:56.098
Doing the best you can

16:56.101 --> 16:57.361
with the worst options you've got.

16:57.363 --> 16:59.188
Right now, I'm surviving for two.

16:59.191 --> 17:01.525
So I will do anything required.

17:01.527 --> 17:02.726
Fine.

17:02.728 --> 17:05.796
Then be prepared if I do the same.

17:13.372 --> 17:14.839
Shit.

17:23.915 --> 17:25.415
I know.

17:25.416 --> 17:29.152
I just needed to be sure.

17:29.154 --> 17:30.954
It's okay.

17:30.956 --> 17:32.956
No, it's not.

17:32.958 --> 17:34.558
This is not okay.

17:36.628 --> 17:37.868
You know,

17:37.871 --> 17:41.006
for a superior alien race,
they have a serious lack

17:41.009 --> 17:43.700
of caffeinated beverage options in here.

17:43.702 --> 17:46.032
There you go.

17:51.276 --> 17:53.110
You okay?

17:53.112 --> 17:56.246
I don't actually know if I can do this.

17:56.248 --> 17:59.316
What, the jump to the Necropolis?

17:59.318 --> 18:03.487
- You worried about the risks?
- I'm worried about the ifs.

18:03.489 --> 18:05.756
If I can't do this, if
I'm not smart enough,

18:05.758 --> 18:07.290
then the trail runs cold.

18:07.292 --> 18:11.094
And then they really are gone...

18:11.096 --> 18:13.163
because I let them down.

18:13.165 --> 18:18.435
Okay, let's just, um...

18:18.437 --> 18:22.072
unpack that there, happy pants.

18:22.074 --> 18:25.509
Um...

18:25.511 --> 18:28.345
I think it's a mutually understood fact

18:28.347 --> 18:32.182
that without you, I would
have died on that Rack.

18:32.184 --> 18:34.484
I would have died of starvation

18:34.486 --> 18:36.671
on a ship full of food

18:36.674 --> 18:38.654
and not because I lack your tech savvy

18:38.657 --> 18:41.891
or your freakish sense of direction

18:41.894 --> 18:43.960
but because I never
would have had the courage

18:43.962 --> 18:46.563
to open that door.

18:48.300 --> 18:50.634
So...

18:52.805 --> 18:56.173
Open that door, Zeph.

18:56.175 --> 18:57.541
It's what you're good at.

19:00.712 --> 19:02.245
So are you coming with me if I do?

19:02.247 --> 19:03.516
Not on your life.

19:03.519 --> 19:05.048
- You owe me your life!
- I gave you

19:05.050 --> 19:06.683
a really good Pip talk just now!

19:06.685 --> 19:08.243
- Pip!
- No, you're the worst!

19:16.195 --> 19:18.829
Open the door, Zeph.

19:21.033 --> 19:24.067
The Overseers... they're here.

19:24.069 --> 19:26.336
Okay, everyone stay
calm and follow our lead.

19:26.338 --> 19:28.171
We can handle this.

19:31.710 --> 19:35.512
All right, line up for receipt.

19:35.514 --> 19:37.881
- Who the hells are you?
- We just want to talk.

19:37.883 --> 19:40.016
We're here to renegotiate.

19:40.018 --> 19:42.552
- Is that a joke?
- Don't move.

19:42.554 --> 19:44.954
- What are you doing?
- We want out of here.

19:44.957 --> 19:46.179
Hang on, this is not what we...

19:46.181 --> 19:48.029
Shut up! Take them.

19:48.032 --> 19:49.960
They're Killjoys. They're lost.

19:49.962 --> 19:51.361
Nobody knows they're here.

19:51.363 --> 19:53.029
Excuse me. What is going on?

19:53.032 --> 19:54.904
- Everybody, guns down!
- That's not the deal.

19:54.907 --> 19:57.601
Screw the deal! Think
of what they're worth.

19:57.603 --> 19:59.536
- Jonesy, no!
- Take them,

19:59.538 --> 20:00.704
or I'll shoot them right now

20:00.706 --> 20:03.039
and they won't be worth anything!

20:03.041 --> 20:05.756
Sky's so clear here.
I can see for miles.

20:05.759 --> 20:08.378
We're a farming collective. Sharecop.

20:09.548 --> 20:12.215
Oh...

20:12.217 --> 20:13.918
I get it.

20:29.902 --> 20:32.669
Johnny...

20:32.671 --> 20:35.672
what did you do?

20:35.674 --> 20:37.224
You haven't figured it out yet?

20:37.227 --> 20:38.808
That you lost your mind?

20:38.810 --> 20:40.577
Yeah, that's...

20:40.579 --> 20:42.445
- pretty clear, John.
- What?

20:42.447 --> 20:44.347
I only shot the ones
with guns, and besides,

20:44.349 --> 20:47.017
this was a con job.

20:47.019 --> 20:48.685
Come on!

20:48.687 --> 20:51.488
Purple fingers there
was an intake medic.

20:51.490 --> 20:55.258
The stain is from shitty
industrial-grade sanitation.

20:55.260 --> 20:56.560
Everyone here is chipped.

20:56.562 --> 20:57.954
The atmo is so clear,

20:57.957 --> 21:01.291
there's obviously no
surface-to-air traffic.

21:01.294 --> 21:04.224
And I didn't see a single farm
while we were walking here.

21:04.227 --> 21:05.802
So?

21:05.804 --> 21:07.470
So... hello!

21:07.472 --> 21:10.340
What kind of place has
guards, medics, ID chips,

21:10.342 --> 21:12.642
and restricted air travel?

21:12.644 --> 21:15.278
- A prison.
- Ding-ding for the fat lady.

21:15.280 --> 21:16.786
They are not farmers.

21:16.789 --> 21:18.388
They are prisoners in a labor colony,

21:18.391 --> 21:19.983
and they were gonna
make us do their time.

21:19.985 --> 21:22.385
You're wrong.

21:22.387 --> 21:24.621
Yeah?

21:26.825 --> 21:28.144
Johnny.

21:28.147 --> 21:30.193
- Johnny, I'm warning you.
- Then where...

21:30.195 --> 21:32.929
are... the farms?

21:36.401 --> 21:38.201
We are the farms.

21:40.505 --> 21:43.173
Oh!

21:43.175 --> 21:45.293
I did not see that one coming.

21:48.470 --> 21:50.336
He got most of it right.

21:50.338 --> 21:52.904
This is a debtors colony...
Unsupervised, mostly.

21:52.907 --> 21:54.274
You're sent here to fend for yourself

21:54.276 --> 21:55.984
and work off your debt
in a bunch of ways.

21:55.987 --> 21:58.077
- And your way was...
- Organ harvest.

21:58.079 --> 22:00.246
- Highest pay of all.
- How does that even work?

22:00.248 --> 22:01.571
When it's your time, your chip beeps

22:01.573 --> 22:03.307
and tells you what depot to go to.

22:03.310 --> 22:05.410
There are depots all across the planet.

22:05.413 --> 22:08.454
We report in, or they track us down.

22:08.456 --> 22:11.698
You'll do nicely.

22:11.701 --> 22:13.440
Doc takes what they want,

22:13.443 --> 22:15.527
doses you with a new organ
bud and regrowth meds,

22:15.530 --> 22:17.397
and you start the
process all over again.

22:17.399 --> 22:19.424
Regrowth?

22:19.427 --> 22:21.301
How many times have
you been through this?

22:21.303 --> 22:22.666
13.

22:22.669 --> 22:24.304
And they keep adding
debt for rent and food

22:24.306 --> 22:25.538
so you can never be free.

22:25.540 --> 22:26.739
I just wanted it to stop.

22:26.741 --> 22:28.463
By selling us for parts instead.

22:28.466 --> 22:30.409
Not you, just... Just them.

22:30.412 --> 22:32.212
Oh!

22:32.214 --> 22:34.881
- I like her.
- Look, I'm sorry.

22:34.883 --> 22:36.216
I couldn't go through it again.

22:36.218 --> 22:37.951
I thought you two had a fighting chance.

22:37.953 --> 22:40.019
Hey, maybe you are a farmer.

22:40.021 --> 22:41.921
Sure talk a lot of horseshit.

22:49.998 --> 22:52.265
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh?

22:52.267 --> 22:53.882
It's this guy's ID chip.

22:53.885 --> 22:56.336
They're all going off.

22:56.338 --> 22:58.338
Life sight: offline.

22:58.340 --> 23:00.974
All personnel, you have
five minutes to report in

23:00.976 --> 23:02.112
and avoid censure.

23:02.115 --> 23:04.710
All detainees, remain in position.

23:04.713 --> 23:06.479
Or what? What happens next?

23:06.481 --> 23:07.947
They come for us.

23:07.949 --> 23:11.684
They send a ship full
of guards and guns now.

23:11.686 --> 23:13.686
Good.

23:25.800 --> 23:27.700
It's just nice to get out, you know?

23:27.702 --> 23:29.335
Hmm.

23:29.337 --> 23:31.170
- Fresh air, bit of sun.
- Yeah.

23:31.172 --> 23:33.023
Praise the trees. Praise them.

23:33.026 --> 23:34.940
Praise them hard!

23:34.943 --> 23:37.409
So how do you know...

23:37.412 --> 23:39.312
- Fairuza?
- Fairuza, yeah.

23:39.314 --> 23:41.381
Oh, you know...

23:41.383 --> 23:43.650
just around the way.

23:43.652 --> 23:45.685
Word of mouth...

23:45.687 --> 23:46.686
and such.

23:59.234 --> 24:01.034
Who's next?

24:06.574 --> 24:09.742
- Sit.
- Yes, ma'am.

24:09.744 --> 24:12.345
Since when are Scarbacks
sadists, by the way?

24:12.347 --> 24:15.348
I thought your rituals
were all about taking pain.

24:15.350 --> 24:18.318
I took pain for 12
years, until I found out

24:18.320 --> 24:20.386
my religion was built on shit.

24:20.388 --> 24:22.698
Now I'm in charge of who hurts.

24:23.838 --> 24:25.140
Seems fair, actually...

24:27.028 --> 24:28.428
So...

24:28.430 --> 24:30.863
what about you?

24:30.865 --> 24:32.398
You need forgiving?

24:32.400 --> 24:35.134
Me?

24:35.136 --> 24:37.523
Oh, I'm just an angel
dipped in chocolate.

24:39.138 --> 24:41.239
But I do have a proposition for you.

24:41.242 --> 24:44.378
- We need onto the Necropolis.
- Oh, Gared...

24:46.147 --> 24:48.014
- Get out.
- Listen, I know...

24:48.016 --> 24:50.616
Nothing, if you could
ask me to go back there.

24:50.618 --> 24:53.486
I was friends with Alvis Akari.

24:53.488 --> 24:55.488
I'm trying to find the
bitch who killed him.

24:55.490 --> 24:57.690
But that starts with getting inside

24:57.692 --> 25:00.126
that floating tomb.

25:00.128 --> 25:02.462
It's too late. No one
can get in there now.

25:02.464 --> 25:04.063
We can.

25:04.065 --> 25:05.732
We just need someone
who knows the inside

25:05.734 --> 25:07.500
well enough to guide us

25:07.502 --> 25:09.604
so we can avenge Alvis' death.

25:11.573 --> 25:13.840
Well, then I'm coming with you.

25:13.842 --> 25:17.477
And I keep any artifact that I find.

25:17.479 --> 25:19.779
I think we can manage that.

25:24.085 --> 25:25.752
Long as we're here,

25:25.754 --> 25:28.388
it seems rude not to, you know...

25:28.390 --> 25:30.323
worship?

25:30.325 --> 25:32.925
Oh, what the hells? I
haven't been that good.

25:34.496 --> 25:36.329
But not the face.

25:36.331 --> 25:38.664
We all want off this planet.

25:38.666 --> 25:40.400
When the reinforcement arrives,

25:40.402 --> 25:41.801
we take their ship.

25:41.803 --> 25:44.537
How? With a few guns and invalids?

25:44.539 --> 25:46.172
If we're smart about it, yeah.

25:46.174 --> 25:48.007
Bored. You're boring.

25:48.009 --> 25:49.842
If we disobey, they'll
just fry us remotely

25:49.844 --> 25:51.778
- with our chips.
- We thought about that.

25:51.780 --> 25:53.746
- We're gonna remove them.
- Don't be daft.

25:53.748 --> 25:54.917
That simple, we'd all have done it.

25:54.919 --> 25:56.386
You know they're wired
against tampering.

25:56.388 --> 25:59.401
Yeah, we thought about that too.

25:59.404 --> 26:00.904
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

26:00.907 --> 26:02.580
I don't think you understand.

26:02.583 --> 26:04.190
600 volts are gonna
tear right through her

26:04.192 --> 26:05.765
if anyone touches that damn thing.

26:05.768 --> 26:07.760
The wires are buried under the skin.

26:07.762 --> 26:10.463
Thank you, undereducated criminal type.

26:10.465 --> 26:11.898
Electricity's like a
river. You don't like

26:11.900 --> 26:13.433
where it's flowing, you
just have to reroute...

26:15.103 --> 26:16.440
John.

26:16.443 --> 26:18.837
All part of the plan. Whoo!

26:18.840 --> 26:20.473
Whoa.

26:20.475 --> 26:22.508
- That was hot.
- We warned him.

26:22.510 --> 26:24.252
Who's next?

26:24.255 --> 26:27.723
Don't everyone volunteer at once.

26:27.726 --> 26:29.416
Look, here's the plan.

26:29.419 --> 26:31.719
We know the guards are coming here...

26:31.722 --> 26:34.019
John.

26:34.022 --> 26:36.155
Johnny.

26:36.157 --> 26:39.392
Fight it, Johnny. You're losing me.

26:39.394 --> 26:41.080
You're not real.

26:42.897 --> 26:46.399
That doesn't make me wrong.

26:46.401 --> 26:48.963
I'm not ready to say good-bye.

26:50.672 --> 26:52.371
Are you?

26:55.610 --> 26:57.677
Everybody removes their ID chips.

26:57.679 --> 26:59.846
They'll take it as some
kind of fritz in the system.

26:59.848 --> 27:01.414
You line up like it's any other day...

27:01.416 --> 27:03.283
So who's up next?

27:09.924 --> 27:11.958
What the hells is that?

27:11.960 --> 27:13.192
It's a...

27:13.194 --> 27:14.927
jump cube?

27:14.929 --> 27:16.629
I took the tech from Khlyen's jump ship

27:16.631 --> 27:19.298
and combined it with his mirror cube.

27:19.300 --> 27:21.901
- How does it work?
- In theory,

27:21.903 --> 27:23.836
the cube can't survive open space,

27:23.838 --> 27:26.439
but as long as we go
from interior to interior,

27:26.441 --> 27:30.309
the jump tech should
transport us like... so.

27:30.311 --> 27:32.411
Fairuza showed me the
Necropolis dimensions,

27:32.413 --> 27:35.448
so hopefully we won't merge
with a wall or a couch.

27:35.450 --> 27:37.049
- Fingers crossed.
- Yeah.

27:37.051 --> 27:38.584
- Tight space in here.
- Yeah.

27:38.586 --> 27:40.190
Fits two, maybe three.

27:40.193 --> 27:42.287
So whoever comes with needs
to understand the risks.

27:42.290 --> 27:45.054
Okay, well, I found
this bad boy in storage,

27:45.057 --> 27:46.721
so I am good to climb aboard, Cap.

27:46.724 --> 27:48.007
No, no, no, I was joking before.

27:48.010 --> 27:49.407
You don't actually have to come with.

27:49.409 --> 27:51.464
Uh, no, I actually kind of do.

27:51.466 --> 27:53.866
We have one shot at this.

27:53.868 --> 27:56.969
And I know that I'm not brave...

27:56.971 --> 27:59.639
or strong...

27:59.641 --> 28:00.752
or...

28:00.755 --> 28:02.208
Feel free to stop me whenever.

28:02.210 --> 28:03.609
- No, I'm good.
- But I have...

28:03.611 --> 28:05.478
shot a gun before.

28:05.480 --> 28:06.879
And hacking secrets from tech

28:06.881 --> 28:08.915
is kind of what people pay me for.

28:08.917 --> 28:11.817
And they pay me a lot. And besides,

28:11.819 --> 28:15.254
I'm sure that Scarback
of my sexual nightmares

28:15.256 --> 28:17.135
will protect us just fine.

28:17.138 --> 28:19.024
Fine. But the, uh, helmet...

28:19.027 --> 28:20.960
Yeah, safety first.

28:20.962 --> 28:23.262
No, I just mean if I'm
wrong in my calculations,

28:23.264 --> 28:24.664
we'll be instantaneously crushed

28:24.666 --> 28:26.799
by about 6 million
cubic pounds of pressure.

28:26.801 --> 28:29.502
So...

28:29.504 --> 28:30.636
bigger helmet?

28:46.821 --> 28:48.721
All clear...

28:51.726 --> 28:53.659
Ish.

28:58.933 --> 29:02.501
I'm so sorry.

29:06.474 --> 29:08.407
It's what I came for.

29:12.814 --> 29:15.848
They deserve a proper burial.

29:15.850 --> 29:17.850
A religious one?

29:17.852 --> 29:21.276
I may not believe anymore, but they did.

29:21.279 --> 29:23.180
They would want the song of the dead.

29:25.226 --> 29:28.160
Psst!

29:28.162 --> 29:30.496
Okay, I can get to the tech room

29:30.498 --> 29:31.760
through the service stairs,

29:31.763 --> 29:33.617
try to find a visual record
of what happened here.

29:33.619 --> 29:35.434
Are you okay?

29:35.436 --> 29:39.136
Yeah, we're fine. Just, um... be fast.

29:39.139 --> 29:41.406
This place gives me a creepy
feeling for some reason.

29:41.409 --> 29:43.509
Well, we are in a dark room
with a lot of dead people

29:43.511 --> 29:45.077
in capes, so...

29:45.079 --> 29:47.244
Right, yeah. Probably that.

29:53.388 --> 29:55.888
May your roots carry you home.

30:08.581 --> 30:10.277
- What the hells is it?
- Plan B,

30:10.280 --> 30:11.947
for when yours fails, which it will

30:11.950 --> 30:15.254
because it relies on humans,
and, well, humans are trash.

30:15.257 --> 30:18.454
I made it from the
farmers' GPS tracking chips.

30:18.456 --> 30:20.757
Pair it with the
elevator, and whoop-whoop!

30:20.759 --> 30:23.126
Instant homing beacon.
Lucy to the rescue.

30:23.128 --> 30:24.994
I don't like it.

30:24.996 --> 30:26.566
I don't like you.

30:26.569 --> 30:28.064
How do we know it won't attract

30:28.067 --> 30:29.911
- some kind of danger?
- Because I coded it

30:29.914 --> 30:31.418
to Lucy's specific receiver.

30:31.421 --> 30:32.707
Take me five seconds to hook up,

30:32.710 --> 30:34.610
and it'll double our odds
of getting off this...

30:34.613 --> 30:37.080
shitball.

30:37.083 --> 30:39.075
Fine.

30:39.077 --> 30:40.677
Take it.

30:40.679 --> 30:43.079
John stays.

30:43.081 --> 30:44.914
I'm sorry, you trust BitchSeyah,

30:44.916 --> 30:46.394
queen of the Hullen, over me?

30:46.397 --> 30:48.717
Currently, yes, and I
need you here to fight.

30:48.720 --> 30:50.587
Why can't she fight? She's
stronger than any of us.

30:50.589 --> 30:51.955
Oh, thank you.

30:51.957 --> 30:54.157
But I agree with
D'Avin. You're outvoted.

30:54.159 --> 30:57.293
I go to the elevator.
So where do we stick it?

30:57.295 --> 30:59.429
And if you say "up my ass,"

30:59.431 --> 31:01.798
I will knock you on yours.

31:01.800 --> 31:05.368
Sync it with the panel
where the rations were kept.

31:05.370 --> 31:06.903
Bring Bea with you.

31:06.905 --> 31:08.438
If you need help, send her back.

31:08.440 --> 31:11.274
And, um...

31:11.276 --> 31:12.442
take a gun.

31:12.444 --> 31:14.911
Whoa, hold... Hold on a minute.

31:14.913 --> 31:17.914
Are you overprotecting
her because of the spawn?

31:17.916 --> 31:20.717
Oh, that is so sexist.

31:20.719 --> 31:22.085
Don't shoot him. He's family.

31:22.087 --> 31:23.786
Good luck with the trap.

31:23.788 --> 31:27.056
Hope you don't die before I'm back.

31:27.058 --> 31:29.192
Take care of...

31:29.194 --> 31:31.728
our baby.

31:31.730 --> 31:33.663
And also...

31:33.665 --> 31:36.466
you too.

31:40.472 --> 31:43.740
Holidays are gonna suck now.

31:58.323 --> 32:00.156
Can I ask you

32:00.158 --> 32:02.590
what made you finally
leave the Scarbacks?

32:05.463 --> 32:06.758
When I found out how many lies

32:06.761 --> 32:09.418
the Elders were telling us
about the origin of our faith.

32:12.370 --> 32:14.771
Faith is like any type of romance.

32:14.773 --> 32:16.199
You can't love someone

32:16.202 --> 32:18.708
if they don't think
you're worth the truth.

32:21.980 --> 32:24.547
But I guess you know all about that.

32:26.918 --> 32:29.018
What is this?

32:29.020 --> 32:30.553
Uh, Hullen spunk.

32:30.555 --> 32:32.221
AKA nothing good.

32:32.223 --> 32:34.113
Pip? You okay down there?

32:34.116 --> 32:35.683
Yeah. Kind of creepy, though.

32:35.686 --> 32:37.226
There's a Hullen Doll here.

32:37.228 --> 32:39.395
That's weird. We're in the, uh...

32:39.397 --> 32:41.410
Worship room. Tenth level.

32:41.413 --> 32:42.638
Tenth-floor Worship.

32:42.641 --> 32:45.241
Any visuals on what happened here?

32:45.244 --> 32:46.601
Trying...

32:46.604 --> 32:48.996
Ow!

32:48.999 --> 32:50.865
I found what looks like

32:50.868 --> 32:52.708
an old-school generator.

32:52.711 --> 32:56.679
Trying to connect it to
their recording system.

32:56.681 --> 32:57.880
We should be in business...

33:01.019 --> 33:02.919
Hey!

33:02.921 --> 33:04.954
I did that.

33:23.174 --> 33:26.075
Hey! I found something.

33:26.077 --> 33:27.877
You need to see this.

33:27.879 --> 33:30.413
Okay, show me...

33:30.415 --> 33:32.648
the elevator cams.

33:35.987 --> 33:38.554
Okay, show me...

33:38.556 --> 33:41.290
the Worship room.

33:41.292 --> 33:43.227
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

33:44.581 --> 33:48.797
There you are.

33:48.800 --> 33:51.968
- Oh, she's angry.
- Who?

33:51.970 --> 33:53.903
Stay! Protect our exit!

33:56.875 --> 33:58.674
No, no!

34:01.679 --> 34:03.279
That's all wrong.

34:03.281 --> 34:05.481
- What is?
- I mean, take your pick.

34:05.483 --> 34:07.550
The angle, the choice
of weapon, the rigor.

34:07.552 --> 34:10.219
The others were killed by
a blade, probably Aneela's.

34:10.221 --> 34:13.456
This... was a self-inflicted wound.

34:13.458 --> 34:17.092
- Which means?
- He committed suicide.

34:17.094 --> 34:20.496
But the Hullen are
practically immortal, so...

34:20.498 --> 34:22.965
why would he do that?

34:22.967 --> 34:24.667
Don't...

34:24.668 --> 34:28.004
move.

34:28.005 --> 34:31.174
You're gonna roll over on three, okay?

34:32.811 --> 34:34.944
One...

34:34.946 --> 34:36.646
- two...
- Shit!

34:51.728 --> 34:54.163
What in the trees is that?

34:54.165 --> 34:56.699
Research.

34:56.701 --> 35:00.970
Pip, we found something weird.

35:00.972 --> 35:04.273
- Pip?
- What the hells was that?

35:08.346 --> 35:10.980
Pip, you there?

35:15.425 --> 35:16.459
Pip?

35:19.403 --> 35:21.301
Ow! What the hells?

35:21.304 --> 35:22.937
You what the hells! Don't grab people

35:22.940 --> 35:24.897
- in the freaking dark like that!
- Why are you running?

35:24.899 --> 35:26.965
Because you weren't
answering, and I was worried!

35:26.968 --> 35:28.177
Oh, that's actually really sweet.

35:28.179 --> 35:29.178
How'd you cut your face?

35:29.180 --> 35:31.714
I-I don't know.

35:31.716 --> 35:34.583
Wow, must have sliced it on
some of the old machinery.

35:34.585 --> 35:37.086
Worth it, okay? I have good news.

35:37.088 --> 35:38.621
I know what happened to the boys

35:38.623 --> 35:39.789
and how to find them.

35:43.112 --> 35:44.860
We need to get out of here.

35:51.302 --> 35:52.868
It's so small.

35:52.870 --> 35:54.470
How long were you
stuck floating in here?

35:54.472 --> 35:56.872
I blocked it out.

35:56.874 --> 35:59.675
How'd you pass the time
without killing each other?

36:04.916 --> 36:06.340
Come to Daddy, baby. Come to Daddy.

36:06.343 --> 36:07.616
One, two, three. Go.

36:07.618 --> 36:10.019
How did that make you feel? Tell him.

36:10.021 --> 36:11.453
He didn't dis...

36:11.455 --> 36:12.688
He didn't respect me

36:12.690 --> 36:13.796
as a man.

36:13.799 --> 36:15.491
No, no, no, you cheated the last time.

36:15.493 --> 36:16.692
- This is...
- I did not.

36:21.032 --> 36:22.898
Doesn't mean you get to
just steal all the food.

36:22.900 --> 36:25.040
I do, actually.

36:25.043 --> 36:26.543
If you keep

36:26.546 --> 36:28.972
farting and snoring, I
am going to kill you both.

36:30.007 --> 36:33.609
We came close once or twice.

36:33.611 --> 36:37.012
But they're really not
so bad... for humans.

36:37.014 --> 36:39.782
Pardon?

36:41.853 --> 36:46.022
Well, all right, Uncle Johnny.

36:48.259 --> 36:51.160
Depot's on lockdown. Traps are set.

36:51.162 --> 36:53.996
No movement yet, but
everybody's in position.

36:53.998 --> 36:57.800
I'm impressed you came up
with such a detailed plan.

36:57.802 --> 37:00.215
Well, secretly, I have always been

37:00.218 --> 37:01.704
the smart one.

37:01.706 --> 37:03.272
Not according to Dad.

37:03.274 --> 37:05.168
Dad can kiss my ass and choke on it.

37:05.171 --> 37:08.510
Why would he choke on your ass?

37:08.512 --> 37:11.146
Look, you know that we're
gonna be outnumbered, right?

37:11.148 --> 37:13.854
- Yep.
- What if your traps fail?

37:13.857 --> 37:15.357
What if they come in and shoot us all?

37:15.359 --> 37:16.819
What if your plan is stupid?

37:16.821 --> 37:19.688
- Can't be. Gotta work.
- Why?

37:19.690 --> 37:21.691
Because she's depending on us, John.

37:24.095 --> 37:25.761
You're still worried about Dutch.

37:25.763 --> 37:27.429
Every second.

37:27.431 --> 37:30.065
And so are you, asshole... Underneath.

37:30.067 --> 37:31.767
So we're gonna get on that ship

37:31.769 --> 37:33.535
and out of here if I have to use you

37:33.537 --> 37:34.970
as a Hullen shield.

37:34.972 --> 37:37.039
And when we get home?

37:37.041 --> 37:38.707
- Then what?
- I'm gonna cure

37:38.709 --> 37:41.577
the shit out of you.

37:41.579 --> 37:44.713
Like you cured Sabine?

37:44.715 --> 37:46.382
What?

37:46.384 --> 37:47.750
No!

37:47.752 --> 37:49.351
Is this your move?

37:49.353 --> 37:51.787
We, uh... we finally gonna do this?

37:51.789 --> 37:53.122
Stop!

37:53.124 --> 37:56.225
Okay, no, seriously. Seriously, though.

37:56.227 --> 37:58.694
What if you had to? I mean, what if...

37:58.696 --> 38:01.030
it was the only way?

38:01.032 --> 38:02.665
John...

38:02.667 --> 38:05.200
I would wreck you.

38:08.906 --> 38:11.558
Oh, shit. Shit, man.

38:11.561 --> 38:13.142
When did our life get so weird?

38:13.144 --> 38:14.944
I don't know, man.

38:14.946 --> 38:18.147
I needed this.

38:18.149 --> 38:19.949
Have you always been this funny?

38:19.951 --> 38:21.383
No.

38:21.385 --> 38:23.052
It's the laughing gas.

38:23.054 --> 38:24.721
What?

38:26.607 --> 38:28.958
I'm the smart one!

38:32.062 --> 38:34.729
What do you plan to do when you're free?

38:34.732 --> 38:36.231
I'm not sure.

38:36.234 --> 38:38.065
I'm not like you. I'm
not close to my family.

38:40.604 --> 38:43.172
Oh, we are not a family.

38:43.174 --> 38:45.074
I mean, they're brothers.

38:45.076 --> 38:47.776
And one of them is the
baby's genetic father.

38:47.778 --> 38:49.745
And my girlfriend is the...

38:49.747 --> 38:52.281
mm, sort of... sister-mother

38:52.283 --> 38:53.849
of their girlfriend?

38:53.851 --> 38:56.318
But... but we do not get along.

38:56.320 --> 38:57.600
There's lots of murders

38:57.603 --> 39:00.788
and evil plots for domination and...

39:00.791 --> 39:03.058
Oh, Gods.

39:03.060 --> 39:04.827
We are a family.

39:06.630 --> 39:08.964
It worked! Your ship's here!

39:08.966 --> 39:10.431
No, no, it's way too soon.

39:10.434 --> 39:12.401
- Move, move, move!
- On your knees!

39:12.403 --> 39:14.436
On your knees!

39:14.438 --> 39:16.271
- Where's Miller?
- Who?

39:16.273 --> 39:18.007
Miller, the guard.

39:18.009 --> 39:20.509
We followed his distress call here.

39:33.324 --> 39:35.624
Well played, John Jaqobis.

39:40.531 --> 39:42.898
Son of a bitch.

39:42.900 --> 39:44.566
I know exactly where we are

39:44.568 --> 39:47.036
and where to get my next plasma fix.

39:47.038 --> 39:48.971
It's a beautiful day!

39:48.973 --> 39:50.973
Isn't it?

40:03.175 --> 40:05.475
They took a bath.

40:05.477 --> 40:07.176
Who takes a goddamn bath in the middle

40:07.178 --> 40:09.445
of a goddamn war? Goddamn!

40:09.447 --> 40:11.447
It wasn't exactly a bubble bath.

40:11.449 --> 40:14.697
The security cam footage
shows that Dutch and Aneela

40:14.700 --> 40:16.853
disappeared into a pool of green.

40:16.855 --> 40:18.588
But we know the boys and Delle Seyah

40:18.590 --> 40:20.444
made it onto that elevator alive...

40:20.447 --> 40:22.447
Surrounded by Hullen ships but alive.

40:22.450 --> 40:24.327
This is the last audio recording

40:24.329 --> 40:25.796
from inside the elevator.

40:25.799 --> 40:26.931
How many ships, Luce?

40:26.934 --> 40:28.783
11 docked, more coming.

40:28.786 --> 40:30.466
The docking bay is compromised.

40:30.468 --> 40:32.122
They'll be on us once we arrive.

40:32.125 --> 40:34.170
Lucy, you'll have to
sever the elevator cable.

40:34.172 --> 40:35.905
But then you won't be able to reach me.

40:35.907 --> 40:37.462
You'll be floating in space.

40:37.465 --> 40:39.075
That's a risk we gotta take.

40:39.077 --> 40:41.430
Do it, Luce. Cut us down.

40:41.433 --> 40:43.361
Five... four...

40:43.364 --> 40:46.182
three... two... one.

40:51.423 --> 40:52.855
Why are you smiling?

40:52.857 --> 40:55.058
Because I know Lucy, and there's no way

40:55.060 --> 40:56.970
she's letting her boy Johnny slip away.

40:56.973 --> 41:00.040
So I checked the Necropolis'
external view logs.

41:00.043 --> 41:02.364
You know that sound right
before she cut the cord

41:02.367 --> 41:03.900
and it all went dead?

41:08.073 --> 41:10.056
- What is that?
- A tagger,

41:10.059 --> 41:12.508
a tracking device Lucy
shot onto the elevator

41:12.510 --> 41:14.611
so she could find it wherever it went.

41:14.613 --> 41:16.879
Find Lucy, find the boys.

41:16.881 --> 41:18.615
Well, great.

41:18.617 --> 41:21.417
That just leaves us
the obvious questions.

41:21.419 --> 41:22.798
How do we find Lucy?

41:24.923 --> 41:27.190
And where the hell did Dutch go?

41:29.628 --> 41:32.328
Wherever she is, she'll be okay.

41:32.330 --> 41:34.797
At least the boys made it out alive.

41:34.799 --> 41:36.466
They'll find her.

41:36.468 --> 41:38.301
Right?

41:38.303 --> 41:39.669
Let's roll.

41:39.671 --> 41:42.405
I got a hot date with a green pool.

41:47.698 --> 41:49.899
Delle Seyah's right.
You do snore too much.

41:50.915 --> 41:53.316
Hey. Dutch is gonna love that one.

41:53.318 --> 41:55.284
Well, you know, if she's not dead.

41:55.286 --> 41:57.987
- John, where's Delle Seyah?
- You mean where's the baby.

41:57.989 --> 41:59.989
Not my kid, not my problem.

41:59.991 --> 42:02.258
But I do know where we are.

42:02.260 --> 42:04.360
I got big plans, big brother.

42:04.362 --> 42:05.695
And you're gonna help me with 'em.

42:05.697 --> 42:07.764
Okay, slow down and think about this.

42:07.766 --> 42:09.454
We can't just run off.

42:09.457 --> 42:12.335
Of course not, stupid.

42:12.337 --> 42:14.656
We'll drive!

42:14.659 --> 42:16.659
You ready for a road trip?
