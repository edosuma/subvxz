WEBVTT

00:01.560 --> 00:03.790
Happy. That's the word.

00:03.830 --> 00:05.627
PETRA:
Happy that you
won the election?

00:05.670 --> 00:07.638
Yes. And very grateful

00:07.670 --> 00:09.638
to all those_ _
who shared my VlSlon.

00:09.670 --> 00:12.730
It's really... a shared victory.

00:12.780 --> 00:15.169
PETRA:
A Victory
that becomes less improbable

00:15.210 --> 00:17.644
when you see Alicia Florrick
in action.

00:17.680 --> 00:20.547
ALICIA:
What do I love the most
about coming to my law firm?

00:20.580 --> 00:23.640
Well, that's easy.
The camaraderie.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.681
PETRA:
If Alicia Florrick's
a legal powerhouse,

00:25.720 --> 00:29.656
it's because she commands
the respect of her colleagues.

00:29.690 --> 00:31.658
But it wasn't always so.

00:31.690 --> 00:34.329
St. Alicia came by way
of an arduous journey.

00:34.360 --> 00:36.396
PETRA:
Can we do better
than that one?

00:36.430 --> 00:38.660
Yeah, tell me when.

00:38.700 --> 00:40.292
Uh-uh.

00:42.410 --> 00:43.809
There. No, back one.

00:43.840 --> 00:45.307
Move in on
It slowly.

00:46.740 --> 00:48.537
(rewinding)

00:48.580 --> 00:53.119
St. Alicia came by way
of an arduous journey.

00:53.150 --> 00:56.517
One that took her from
stay-at-home mom to scandal

00:56.550 --> 00:58.211
to lowly associate.

00:58.250 --> 01:00.753
The scandal photo--
can we keep her in color

01:00.790 --> 01:03.327
and make everything
else black and white?

01:06.800 --> 01:08.654
Yeah, great.
Now back to the interview.

01:08.700 --> 01:11.191
(rewinding)

01:11.230 --> 01:13.289
PETRA: _
...to lowly assoaate

01:13.340 --> 01:17.663
to founding partner of one
of Chicago's largest firms.

01:17.710 --> 01:18.836
How will _
my administration differ

01:18.870 --> 01:20.474
from that of my husband's?

01:20.510 --> 01:21.807
Mm-hmm.

01:21.840 --> 01:24.274
Well, it's not...
I can't, um... I...

01:24.310 --> 01:26.471
No, cut the stumble.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.715
(high-pitched, sped-up chatter)

01:28.750 --> 01:30.741
PETRA:
...Chicago's largest firms.

01:30.790 --> 01:32.781
ALICIA:
The better question?

01:32.820 --> 01:36.278
How will my administration be
different from my predecessor?

01:36.330 --> 01:38.628
We will be
accountable to victims,

01:38.660 --> 01:39.820
worthy of the public's trust.

01:39.860 --> 01:41.794
I'm sorry, Petra.
I need to get

01:41.830 --> 01:43.695
Mrs. Florrick on the phone with
the governor just for a moment.

01:43.730 --> 01:45.618
Sure, Eli.
Anything for you.

01:45.670 --> 01:47.535
Going great, though.
Love what you're doing.

01:47.570 --> 01:48.764
Aw, thanks.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.665
There's no one
on the phone.

01:50.710 --> 01:52.803
Just turn around and pretend
you're having a conversation.

01:52.840 --> 01:54.205
It's about the hack.

01:54.240 --> 01:55.730
Are you sure
the e-mails are safe?

01:55.780 --> 01:57.179
We're hearing
that they might still come out.

01:57.210 --> 01:58.746
Hearing from whom?

01:58.780 --> 02:00.145
I heard Diane
and Cary talking.

02:00.180 --> 02:01.613
You want some
crackers?
No.

02:01.650 --> 02:03.584
The hackers want an apology
from the firm.

02:03.620 --> 02:04.848
Well, we already resolved it.

02:04.890 --> 02:06.881
I mean, we can't
publicly condone piracy.

02:06.920 --> 02:08.217
You don't have to.

02:08.260 --> 02:09.784
"We regret any
implication

02:09.830 --> 02:11.889
that the blah-blah-blah
shareware is not
legitimate." You know.

02:11.930 --> 02:13.557
I have to consult my partners.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.420
Well, the deadline's
at the end of the week,

02:15.460 --> 02:17.724
or the e-mails go wide,
so consult fast.

02:17.770 --> 02:19.761
Thank you.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.597
(clears her throat)
PETRA:
Set?

02:21.640 --> 02:22.902
Yes, yes. Sorry about that.

02:22.940 --> 02:24.737
No, no, no.
All set.

02:24.770 --> 02:26.772
EDITOR: I was thinking of using
this stuff for the sit-down.

02:26.810 --> 02:28.778
It looks way better than
the first time she sat down.

02:28.810 --> 02:29.799
I didn't...
(phone dings)

02:31.210 --> 02:33.610
I didn't
shake her hand that time.

02:33.650 --> 02:35.811
(high-pitched, sped-up chatter)

02:42.790 --> 02:45.156
(keys clicking)

02:47.860 --> 02:49.521
ALICIA:
...and we will be transparent.

02:49.570 --> 02:53.597
Accountable to victims,
worthy of the public's trust.

02:53.640 --> 02:56.837
MAN:
Where'd you get these?

02:56.870 --> 02:58.201
An anonymous source.
They're hacked?

02:58.240 --> 02:59.639
Yes. Alicia Florrick's
hacked e-mails

02:59.680 --> 03:00.908
from the past five years.

03:00.940 --> 03:02.544
You have to read them.

03:02.580 --> 03:04.400
Thought this was
a puff piece.
It was.

03:04.450 --> 03:06.543
People don't like when
you tear down their heroes.

03:06.580 --> 03:07.945
Are you kidding?

03:07.980 --> 03:09.345
That's what they live for.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.914
I need independent
corroboration.

03:10.950 --> 03:13.555
Talk to her firm, confirm
they've been hacked.

03:13.590 --> 03:14.887
Yes, we did have an attack

03:14.920 --> 03:17.525
on our e-mail services,
but we have since...

03:17.560 --> 03:19.391
Petra Moritz.

03:19.430 --> 03:22.297
But we have since
repelled that attack.

03:22.330 --> 03:23.763
No, it's had
absolutely no impact...

03:23.800 --> 03:24.619
(elevator bell dings)

03:24.670 --> 03:26.831
ANDREW: Okay,
Daddy just needs a minute,

03:26.870 --> 03:28.599
so I need you guys
to sit quietly.

03:28.640 --> 03:29.834
Come on.
Charlie, come on.

03:29.870 --> 03:32.907
Ms. Sharma, hello.
Good to see you again.

03:32.940 --> 03:34.828
You, too, Mr. Wiley.
What are you up to today?

03:34.880 --> 03:37.576
Oh, just, you know, the
usual-- making trouble.

03:37.610 --> 03:39.475
See you later.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.374
Bye.

03:41.420 --> 03:43.411
RECEPTIONIST: Yes, well, he's
in with a client right now.

03:43.450 --> 03:46.886
Sure, I'd be happy to send you
to voice mail if that's okay.

03:46.920 --> 03:48.456
Uh, that's no
problem at all.

03:48.490 --> 03:49.855
Thank you very much.

03:49.890 --> 03:51.721
That'll be
10:00 tomorrow?

03:51.760 --> 03:54.456
(speaks indistinctly)

03:54.500 --> 03:56.866
(phone rings)
Florrick, Agos & Lockhart.

03:56.900 --> 04:00.438
*

04:02.970 --> 04:04.938
Hey, uh, everything all right?

04:04.970 --> 04:08.007
Yes, I just have to meet this
Mr. Dipple at his think tank.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.849
No, I mean in there.

04:09.880 --> 04:11.973
Oh, yes. Andrew Wiley.
You know, the investigator?

04:12.010 --> 04:14.012
Yeah. What's he asking?

04:14.050 --> 04:15.574
He's working with
Internal Affairs.

04:15.620 --> 04:18.009
Looking into Detective Prima
and how he set up Cary.

04:18.050 --> 04:19.688
Brady Violation.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.654
Yeah, and how
he entrapped Cary, too.

04:21.690 --> 04:23.726
Well, they're finding
that harder to prove.

04:23.760 --> 04:25.057
Why is he talking to us?

04:25.090 --> 04:26.853
They want to find out

04:26.900 --> 04:29.391
how we discovered that
e-mail from Canada.

04:29.430 --> 04:31.022
The one that
Prima deleted.

04:31.070 --> 04:32.765
They want to prosecute
him for this.

04:32.800 --> 04:35.291
See you.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.675
KALINDA:
Hi.
Hey.

04:41.710 --> 04:43.007
Can I help you?

04:43.050 --> 04:45.848
Yeah, uh,
I need some legal advice.

04:45.880 --> 04:48.371
Okay.

04:48.420 --> 04:50.411
Hypothetically, a cop
is going to prison

04:50.450 --> 04:51.986
for something
that he didn't do.

04:52.020 --> 04:53.885
Someone else did it.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.888
But there's a lavwer
who made misrepresentations

04:55.920 --> 04:59.048
based on... on, um...

04:59.090 --> 05:00.557
I, um...

05:00.600 --> 05:02.921
Just don't use names,
and I'm fine.

05:02.970 --> 05:06.929
Look... someone is guilty

05:06.970 --> 05:09.438
of faking evidence,

05:09.470 --> 05:11.665
but a lawyer
who did not fake that evidence,

05:11.710 --> 05:13.974
and, in fact,
thought it to be true,

05:14.010 --> 05:15.477
presented it in court.

05:15.510 --> 05:17.649
Now, is that lavwer in trouble?

05:17.680 --> 05:19.341
What, for using
the faked evidence?

05:19.380 --> 05:21.678
Yeah. Even though she didn't
know that it was faked?

05:21.720 --> 05:23.119
Mm-hmm, yes.

05:23.150 --> 05:25.038
Ignorance is irrelevant.

05:25.090 --> 05:27.513
The lawyer could be disbarred
or even go to prison.

05:29.990 --> 05:32.527
Okay, and, uh,

05:32.560 --> 05:36.997
what if that person
who faked the evidence swore

05:37.030 --> 05:38.566
to the lawyer's innocence?

05:38.600 --> 05:40.989
Doesn't matter.
It's strict liability.

05:43.070 --> 05:45.402
Okay.

05:45.440 --> 05:47.032
Anything else?

05:47.080 --> 05:48.399
No.

05:48.440 --> 05:50.499
Uh, that's enough.
Thank you.

05:50.550 --> 05:52.973
Sure.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.942
(door closes)

05:58.020 --> 05:59.885
Diane,

05:59.920 --> 06:01.649
you brave soul, welcome
to the Plenary Institute.

06:01.690 --> 06:03.453
How am I brave?

06:03.490 --> 06:07.051
Liberal lavwer in this lion's
den of conservatism?
(laughs)

06:07.100 --> 06:10.467
A lion's den is perfectly safe
when you have God on your side.

06:10.500 --> 06:13.435
Ah, there she is,
quoting the Bible. Diane,

06:13.470 --> 06:16.030
may I introduce Max Gauls,
Cole-Harberts-Greyson?

06:16.070 --> 06:18.061
Nice to meet you.
Justin Partridge
of Simkins-Wilde.

06:18.110 --> 06:19.737
It's so good
to meet you.

06:19.780 --> 06:22.101
Diane, have a seat
right over here.
Okay.

06:22.140 --> 06:23.903
So, what am I doing?

06:23.950 --> 06:26.646
Aside from picking up
your retainer check?

06:26.680 --> 06:28.113
I need a liberal viewpoint.

06:28.150 --> 06:29.686
On?

06:29.720 --> 06:31.119
Gay marriage.

06:31.150 --> 06:33.084
You're the devil's advocate.

06:33.120 --> 06:35.418
In what way?
We're trying
to decide

06:35.460 --> 06:37.428
whether to fund a case
on gay marriage

06:37.460 --> 06:39.121
and religious accommodation.

06:39.160 --> 06:40.991
And what is the case?

06:41.030 --> 06:43.919
In May of 2014, Jane Armisen,
a baker in California,

06:43.970 --> 06:46.632
was asked to bake a cake
for a gay wedding.

06:46.670 --> 06:50.629
She refused,
citing religious objections

06:50.670 --> 06:53.173
to supporting gay marriage,
and was sued for discrimination.

06:53.210 --> 06:55.838
She lost.
And you're wondering whether

06:55.880 --> 06:57.074
to take up this baker's appeal?

06:57.110 --> 06:59.840
Yup.
No.

06:59.880 --> 07:02.019
Obviously.
Well, that's not surprising.

07:02.050 --> 07:04.189
(Diane laughs)

07:04.220 --> 07:05.778
Well, it's not because
I'm a liberal.

07:05.820 --> 07:07.515
It's because... you won't win.

07:07.560 --> 07:09.118
I mean, this was
a plain wedding cake?

07:09.160 --> 07:11.048
There was nothing
about the cake itself

07:11.090 --> 07:13.524
that was offensive to the baker?

07:13.560 --> 07:15.221
That's correct. It's the fact
it would have been used

07:15.260 --> 07:17.194
in a ceremony she believes
dishonored her religious creed.

07:17.230 --> 07:19.027
But this baker

07:19.070 --> 07:22.039
advertises to the public that
she makes these wedding cakes,

07:22.070 --> 07:23.105
and she will sell

07:23.140 --> 07:24.903
these wedding cakes to anyone,

07:24.940 --> 07:26.202
just not gay people.

07:26.240 --> 07:28.105
I'm sorry,

07:28.140 --> 07:30.643
but that's not
a strong case.
Well, the Constitution

07:30.680 --> 07:33.046
guarantees her the free exercise
of religion.

07:33.080 --> 07:35.469
And California's Civil Rights
Act forbids discrimination

07:35.520 --> 07:37.647
against LGBT people.

07:37.690 --> 07:39.214
REESE:
So, we have two
competing freedoms.

07:39.250 --> 07:42.253
Businesses are allowed
to refuse serwce to anyone.

07:42.290 --> 07:45.179
With certain exceptions
to that right.

07:45.230 --> 07:47.095
It cannot be based on race,

07:47.130 --> 07:50.167
color, religion
or sexual orientation.

07:50.200 --> 07:51.622
In some states,
sexual orientation.

07:51.670 --> 07:53.069
In many states.

07:53.100 --> 07:54.567
Well, but there are
exceptions to the exceptions.

07:54.600 --> 07:55.828
What did Thomas
Jefferson say?

07:55.870 --> 07:58.065
"Among the most inestimable

07:58.110 --> 08:00.271
"of our blessings is that
of liberty

08:00.310 --> 08:02.107
"to worship our Creator

08:02.140 --> 08:04.142
in a way we think
would be agreeable to Him."

08:04.180 --> 08:06.648
It's no different from
conSCIentious objectors to war.

08:06.680 --> 08:08.147
I'm sorry to be blunt.

08:08.180 --> 08:10.148
I know you come
to your opinions honestly.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.181
Well, it's not just my opinion.

08:12.220 --> 08:14.654
The Religious Freedom
Restoration Act allows

08:14.690 --> 08:17.079
exemptions in
anti-discrimination laws.
Not in California.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.984
California does not have one.
Well, let's say

08:19.030 --> 08:20.657
we're-we'renot
in California.

08:20.700 --> 08:22.668
Let's say we're
in Colorado.

08:22.700 --> 08:24.691
(bell tinkles)

08:24.730 --> 08:27.096
DIANE:
Okay, well, we're not
in Colorado, but RFRA

08:27.140 --> 08:28.835
would not be your
friend there, either.

08:28.870 --> 08:30.167
So, let's say
it's in New Mexico.

08:30.210 --> 08:31.563
DIANE:
It doesn't matter.

08:31.610 --> 08:32.907
The baker's refusing

08:32.940 --> 08:34.168
to sell a wedding cake

08:34.210 --> 08:36.201
to a gay couple
for who they are.

08:36.240 --> 08:38.902
That is the heart
of discrimination.

08:38.950 --> 08:41.612
REESE:
What if our baker won't sell
a wedding cake to a gay couple,

08:41.650 --> 08:44.187
but he will sell them
bear claws?

08:44.220 --> 08:46.279
Cupcakes?
MAX:
That's right.

08:46.320 --> 08:48.049
She isn't, in fact,
refusing to serve homosexuals.

08:48.090 --> 08:49.751
She just won't do the one thing

08:49.790 --> 08:51.257
her religion says is a sin.

08:51.290 --> 08:53.724
Okay.

08:53.760 --> 08:56.194
That's a good point.

08:56.230 --> 08:59.961
Great. Let's take
a little break.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.163
So, um, where is Diane Lockhart?

09:03.210 --> 09:04.768
I'm sorry?

09:04.810 --> 09:06.163
"That's a good point"?

09:06.210 --> 09:07.677
It was a good point.
No, it wasn't.

09:07.710 --> 09:09.769
You know it wasn't.
Well, you wanted me to help.

09:09.810 --> 09:11.209
No, I want you to fight.

09:11.250 --> 09:13.775
I want you to convince me
this is a loser case.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.879
If you're worried
about offending me, don't.

09:15.920 --> 09:17.979
I have a gay nephew, okay?

09:18.020 --> 09:20.784
Love my gay nephew,
want him to be happy.

09:20.820 --> 09:24.051
I just don't happen to believe
in gay marriage. You do.

09:24.090 --> 09:27.218
Convince me I'm wrong.
Go for the jugular?

09:27.260 --> 09:29.967
Mm-hmm, right there,
ma'am. Right there.
(laughs)

09:30.000 --> 09:33.265
That's insane. Selling someone
something they don't want is

09:33.300 --> 09:35.063
the same thing as refusing
them service altogether.

09:35.100 --> 09:36.328
No, it isn't. You
can't even compare...

09:36.370 --> 09:38.167
A vegetarian couple walks
into a market,

09:38.210 --> 09:40.178
and you refuse
to sell them vegetables.

09:40.210 --> 09:42.303
In fact, you'll sell them
anything but vegetables.

09:42.340 --> 09:44.843
You are effectively
denying them service.

09:44.880 --> 09:47.178
A gay couple wants
to buy a wedding cake,

09:47.220 --> 09:49.279
and you refuse
to sell them a wedding cake.

09:49.320 --> 09:51.185
(high-pitched, sped-up chatter)

09:51.220 --> 09:53.279
ALICIA:
The camaraderie,
the relationships

09:53.320 --> 09:56.016
I've built _here-- it's what
makes coming to work a joy.

09:56.060 --> 09:57.880
Relationships
that have been built

09:57.930 --> 10:00.296
with some difficulty...
apparently.

10:00.330 --> 10:01.991
Now cut to the e-mail.

10:02.030 --> 10:03.861
Float it in,
Star Wars style.

10:05.030 --> 10:07.089
(beeping)

10:08.970 --> 10:10.904
"It's all about money to them.

10:10.940 --> 10:13.101
The partners don't
give a damn about us."

10:13.140 --> 10:14.903
Float in the second e-mail.

10:14.940 --> 10:17.374
"The partners don't give a damn
about us."

10:17.410 --> 10:19.674
Two of her coworkers write:

10:19.720 --> 10:21.745
"Alicia is a perfect example

10:21.780 --> 10:23.782
of someone sleeping her way
to the top."

10:23.820 --> 10:25.139
Now change the music.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.856
*
"It's all about money to them.

10:29.890 --> 10:32.859
The partners don't give
a damn about us."

10:32.900 --> 10:34.720
Two of her coworkers write:

10:34.760 --> 10:36.398
"Alicia is a perfect example

10:36.430 --> 10:38.990
of someone sleeping her way
to the top."

10:58.050 --> 11:00.382
Mrs. Florrick,
I want to thank you

11:00.420 --> 11:01.978
for agreeing to sit down
for a second interview.

11:02.020 --> 11:04.022
Absolutely.
We just need
clarification

11:04.060 --> 11:05.789
on a few
things.

11:05.830 --> 11:07.422
Mrs. Florrick,
you returned

11:07.460 --> 11:09.428
to the practice of law
after 12 years...

11:09.460 --> 11:10.859
Thirteen.

11:10.900 --> 11:12.765
13 years. Sorry.

11:12.800 --> 11:14.461
And you walk

11:14.500 --> 11:18.368
into this law firm,
full of old bulls

11:18.410 --> 11:22.005
and young tigers.
Were you nervous?
Very.

11:22.040 --> 11:25.203
And the only person you knew
at all was Will Gardner.

11:25.250 --> 11:27.047
ALICIA: Yes.
The two of you

11:27.080 --> 11:30.481
wound up becoming quite
close, didn't you?

11:30.520 --> 11:32.852
Will was a terrific lavwer.

11:32.890 --> 11:34.881
He was smart,
creative.

11:34.920 --> 11:36.729
Zealous
in the best sense of the word.

11:36.760 --> 11:38.125
Maybe more
importantly,

11:38.160 --> 11:40.799
a... a trusted friend?

11:42.160 --> 11:43.798
Yes.

11:43.830 --> 11:48.233
And after May 2010,
perhaps even more so?

11:48.270 --> 11:50.204
Apologies. I just need
to borrow Alicia for a moment.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.367
I forgot to get an answer
on something time-sensitive.

11:52.410 --> 11:54.139
(door shuts)

11:54.180 --> 11:56.136
(quietly):
She has the e-mails.

11:56.180 --> 11:58.205
Or the photos.
No, she said
May 2010.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.218
That's the e-mails.
What e-mails?
What are we talking about?

12:00.250 --> 12:03.788
How bad?
Give her your phone.
I'm calling this off.

12:05.450 --> 12:08.214
You're saying that a Hindu or a
Muslim can enter a bake shop...

12:08.260 --> 12:10.478
No, that isn't comparable.
Yes, it is.

12:10.530 --> 12:11.883
They're both protected classes.

12:11.930 --> 12:13.898
A Hindu can enter a bake shop

12:13.930 --> 12:15.488
and be denied a wedding cake.

12:15.530 --> 12:17.794
No, no, because that is
denial of a class of people.

12:17.830 --> 12:20.060
Exactly. Like gays.
No, that is

12:20.100 --> 12:23.137
the denial of an activity.
Of the marriage.
Which is just

12:23.170 --> 12:25.229
a pretext for discrimination.
What if it weren't
a blank wedding cake?

12:25.270 --> 12:28.774
Yes, but that's not
what happened.
I know that.

12:28.810 --> 12:30.778
I'm trying to determine
where religious freedom ends

12:30.810 --> 12:32.812
and antidiscrimination laws
begin.

12:32.850 --> 12:35.011
What if Jane were asked
to attach a figurine

12:35.050 --> 12:37.189
of two men holding hands?

12:37.220 --> 12:39.279
Could she deny that service?
DIANE: If she's offering

12:39.320 --> 12:41.481
the service
of supplying figurines,

12:41.520 --> 12:43.522
then, no, she cannot deny
that service.

12:43.560 --> 12:45.152
Well, what if she's asked
to write on the cake

12:45.190 --> 12:47.021
"Congratulations,
Roger and Carl"?

12:47.060 --> 12:48.857
Can she deny that
because it's speech

12:48.900 --> 12:50.094
she doesn't approve of?
Well, now we come around

12:50.130 --> 12:51.529
to the free speech
argument.

12:51.570 --> 12:53.037
Well, you knew
we were gonna end up there.

12:53.070 --> 12:54.298
Okay, well,
here's the thing,

12:54.340 --> 12:56.296
it's not her speech.

12:56.340 --> 12:59.503
It's the speech of the person
purchasing the service.

12:59.540 --> 13:01.303
I mean, imagine if she

13:01.340 --> 13:03.240
is a printer and a gay person

13:03.280 --> 13:05.077
comes in needing flyers.

13:05.110 --> 13:06.509
She cannot reject his business,

13:06.550 --> 13:08.916
even though the flyer
may be advertising

13:08.950 --> 13:10.884
an LGBT meeting,

13:10.920 --> 13:13.218
because to reject him
is to discriminate

13:13.260 --> 13:15.410
based on sexual preference.
Just as one

13:15.460 --> 13:17.849
can't discriminate
based on religion?
Exactly.

13:17.890 --> 13:22.190
So if a Christian walks into
the cake shop and orders a cake

13:22.230 --> 13:24.824
that says
"God sends gays to hell,"

13:24.870 --> 13:26.269
does the baker have to write
that on the wedding cake

13:26.300 --> 13:27.562
even if she doesn't approve
of it?

13:27.600 --> 13:29.295
No.
Because you find it
offensive?

13:29.340 --> 13:34.130
_ No. Because the baker
is not objecting to a religion

13:34.180 --> 13:36.375
but a point of view.

13:36.410 --> 13:37.946
A hateful one at that.
But the purchaser

13:37.980 --> 13:41.143
finds it essential
to his or her faith. I mean,

13:41.180 --> 13:42.477
isn't the Christian
a protected class,

13:42.520 --> 13:44.044
with the same protection
as gays?

13:44.090 --> 13:46.957
(sighs)

13:49.590 --> 13:51.319
(growling)
(laughing)

13:51.360 --> 13:53.248
I'm sorry, there's been
a, uh, slight hiccup

13:53.300 --> 13:54.255
in the investigation.

13:54.300 --> 13:55.927
What hiccup?

13:55.960 --> 13:58.064
Detective Prima
deleted the e-mail

13:58.100 --> 14:00.398
from the Canadian authorities
at 3:11 pm.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.465
on August 28. That's
the great thing

14:02.500 --> 14:04.229
about technology.
You're never wondering,

14:04.270 --> 14:06.500
you know, when this or that
happened. It's all right there

14:06.540 --> 14:08.508
in black and white.
So,good.
So, what's the problem?

14:08.540 --> 14:11.509
Timmy, Dora, less noise.
Uh, okay, here.

14:11.550 --> 14:14.519
Uh, Detective Prima was
on the stand

14:14.550 --> 14:16.916
testifying in a burglary case

14:16.950 --> 14:20.351
from 2:38 pm. to 5:30
pm. on August 28,

14:20.390 --> 14:22.927
so, I mean, unless there's a
mistake in the public record

14:22.960 --> 14:25.019
or in the
e-mail metadata,

14:25.060 --> 14:26.891
there is no possible way...
TIMMY: Ow!

14:26.930 --> 14:28.420
Hey, Dora, let go
of Timmy's hair.

14:28.460 --> 14:30.325
There is no possible way

14:30.370 --> 14:32.668
that Prima could have
deleted the e-mail.
Okay,

14:32.700 --> 14:34.964
so what's
your theory?
Well,

14:35.000 --> 14:38.538
unfortunately, my theory
involves ASA Geneva Pine,

14:38.570 --> 14:40.674
who was having an affair
with Prima at the time.

14:40.710 --> 14:44.271
You're kidding.
No. I mean, you know,
she didn't tell anybody.

14:44.310 --> 14:46.198
You know. I
mean, for...

14:46.250 --> 14:47.911
Uh... Sorry.

14:47.950 --> 14:51.579
Can you... For obvious
reasons. Kids, Cheerios.

14:51.620 --> 14:53.178
(laughing)
CARY: You think she deleted
the e-mail for Prima?

14:53.220 --> 14:54.915
Well, she was the only one
in the department

14:54.960 --> 14:56.279
with access to his account.

14:56.320 --> 14:59.949
I was wondering, uh, if you guys
had any other thoughts.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.663
Uh... (clears throat)
why would we have thoughts?

15:03.700 --> 15:05.122
I have no idea.

15:05.170 --> 15:07.491
Do you?

15:07.540 --> 15:09.132
No.

15:09.170 --> 15:11.934
(shouts)
Don't make me count to five.

15:11.970 --> 15:13.608
Will was a terrific lavwer.

15:13.640 --> 15:16.677
He was smart, creative.

15:16.710 --> 15:19.099
Zealous
in the best sense of the word.

15:19.150 --> 15:21.368
PETRA:
June 2010.

15:26.020 --> 15:27.487
Will to Alicia:

15:31.430 --> 15:33.227
That's a long time
to be on one image.

15:33.260 --> 15:36.195
Right. Cut
to the scandal.

15:36.230 --> 15:38.562
(rewinding)

15:38.600 --> 15:40.659
Make her black and white,
everything else in color.

15:40.700 --> 15:42.429
(keys clacking)

15:43.610 --> 15:45.066
Alicia to Will:

15:46.670 --> 15:48.399
(phone rings)

15:48.440 --> 15:50.078
_ "Sometimes
this feels too dangerous."

15:50.110 --> 15:51.702
Editing.

15:51.750 --> 15:54.617
You'd better
get out there.

15:54.650 --> 15:58.689
She is planning to use
illegally obtained e-mails.
Not just use-- broadcast.

15:58.720 --> 16:00.415
Which is so far beyond
the pale, I can't believe
Hey.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.757
we're having
this conversation.
I-I didn't hack

16:01.790 --> 16:03.758
_ her e-mail_s--
I just received copies of them.

16:03.790 --> 16:06.088
A distinction
without a difference.
Well, no. The Supreme Court

16:06.130 --> 16:07.995
has spoken to this.
Bartnicki v. Vopper.
As long

16:08.030 --> 16:10.396
as we didn't steal the material,
we have a First Amendment right

16:10.430 --> 16:12.762
to publish it.
If it's a matter
of public concern.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.563
_ Mrs_. Florrick
is a public offICIal now.
But that does not

16:14.600 --> 16:17.160
strip her of her right
to privacy.
Exactly. You use

16:17.210 --> 16:19.599
these private e-mails,
sir, you and Petra,

16:19.640 --> 16:23.349
you are, you know,
uh, blah-blah.
Coconspirators.

16:23.380 --> 16:24.677
I'm sorry. You're
wrong on the law.

16:24.710 --> 16:26.678
You can go after the
hackers here but not us.

16:26.710 --> 16:28.575
There is a tort for
the disclosure of private facts.

16:28.620 --> 16:30.349
Well, then sue us after it airs.
Oh,

16:30.390 --> 16:32.779
come on, Charles.
You made a speech

16:32.820 --> 16:34.651
to the International Press
Commi55ion

16:34.690 --> 16:36.612
about the ethics
of journalism.

16:36.660 --> 16:39.026
And now you're looking for cover
to air this kind of, you know...

16:39.060 --> 16:41.654
Scurrilous, sexually charged
innuendo, which, until today,

16:41.700 --> 16:43.327
was the stuff
of tabloids and blogs.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.565
Which, it should be noted,
is where you came from.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.330
Your righteous indignation
is sweet, Eli,

16:48.370 --> 16:50.338
but you started this.

16:50.370 --> 16:53.203
You created the myth
of St. Alicia.
That is

16:53.240 --> 16:57.700
absolutely not true. That is BS.
You love to build people up
and then tear them down.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.706
The truth, which comes out
in these e-mails--

16:59.750 --> 17:02.674
it puts the lie to all that. And
the public has a right to know.

17:02.720 --> 17:05.439
You've really lost
all perspective in this, Petra.
No, you really... It's gross.

17:05.490 --> 17:06.718
You're gross.

17:06.750 --> 17:07.557
Thank you.

17:07.590 --> 17:09.455
I'm gonna hold
this piece until...

17:09.490 --> 17:10.718
Ch-Charles.

17:10.760 --> 17:14.355
...u_-until I can
con5ider all Sides.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.425
Ethically
and otherwise.

17:18.170 --> 17:20.593
What are you gonna do?

17:20.640 --> 17:23.461
(crunching)

17:23.510 --> 17:25.603
Who would be interested in this?

17:25.640 --> 17:27.608
TMZ
or Gawker?

17:27.640 --> 17:30.609
I don't know. Both.

17:31.810 --> 17:34.711
What about a, uh, say,
a wedding planner?

17:34.750 --> 17:36.547
Hmm.

17:36.580 --> 17:38.719
It's First Amendment,
it's personal services,

17:38.750 --> 17:41.685
it-it's religious freedom
all rolled into one. Isn't it?

17:41.720 --> 17:46.783
Yes, you would arguably have
a better case

17:46.830 --> 17:49.424
with a wedding planner
because of the burden on her--

17:49.460 --> 17:51.667
her time commitment,
her level of creativity,

17:51.700 --> 17:54.294
the list of her
personal contacts.

17:54.340 --> 17:57.559
Yes, that-that would be
a harder case for me to win.

17:57.610 --> 17:58.804
Great.

17:58.840 --> 18:00.808
(chuckles)

18:00.840 --> 18:02.501
Well, that was
exhausting.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.405
But effective.

18:04.450 --> 18:07.749
I have decided not
to fund the baker's appeal.
Good.

18:07.780 --> 18:08.872
I think that's smart.

18:08.920 --> 18:11.889
Not just ideologically
but practically.

18:11.920 --> 18:14.718
I think you'd lose.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.251
(sputtering)

18:20.430 --> 18:22.591
(speaking indistinctly)

18:22.630 --> 18:24.689
ANDREW:
Do you know
what metadata is?

18:24.730 --> 18:27.369
I do.
Did you know
it's possible to fake metadata?

18:27.400 --> 18:28.662
I didn't.

18:28.700 --> 18:30.702
Yeah, i-it's very
difficult. Y-You have

18:30.740 --> 18:32.833
to first hack
into the computer,

18:32.870 --> 18:34.804
then change
the code...
I'm really not sure

18:34.840 --> 18:37.400
what it is that you need
from me, Mr. Wiley.

18:37.450 --> 18:40.248
You used to work
in the S.A.'s Office.

18:40.280 --> 18:41.838
I'm just wondering
if you have any information

18:41.880 --> 18:44.644
that might be helpful
to me or if you know

18:44.690 --> 18:46.681
of anyone here who might
have faked the metadata.

18:47.720 --> 18:49.449
No.

18:49.490 --> 18:51.481
Sorry.

18:51.530 --> 18:54.522
Eli couldn't make it. Some
blah-blah with the governor.
Good.

18:54.560 --> 18:57.324
I don't have the energy
to talk to Eli.
What am I doing here?

18:57.370 --> 18:58.519
I wanted to give you a heads-up.

18:58.570 --> 19:00.788
You're kidding me.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.604
I got no choice. Gawker's
starting to sniff around.

19:03.640 --> 19:05.699
It's just a matter
of time before they dump
everything online.

19:05.740 --> 19:08.709
Don't do this.
I can't afford to get scooped.

19:08.740 --> 19:12.198
But you can afford to be a tool.

19:12.250 --> 19:14.218
That's good to know

19:14.250 --> 19:17.310
the next time I need a,
you know... a tool.

19:17.350 --> 19:19.648
(line ringing)

19:19.690 --> 19:21.487
Hi. Alicia.

19:21.520 --> 19:23.659
Bit of a problem.

19:23.690 --> 19:25.487
(NPR theme playing)
From NPR News in Washington,

19:25.530 --> 19:28.454
I'm Lakshmi Singh. Another salvo

19:28.500 --> 19:29.751
in the ongoing cultural dispute

19:29.800 --> 19:32.291
over same-sex marriage
in America,

19:32.330 --> 19:34.298
this time involving a gay couple
in Idaho

19:34.340 --> 19:36.797
who were turned down
by a wedding planner.

19:36.840 --> 19:38.330
Same-sex marriage
is legal in Idaho,

19:38.370 --> 19:40.338
and the couple sued and won.

19:40.380 --> 19:43.349
But now prominent conservative
activist Reese Dipple

19:43.380 --> 19:45.302
has agreed to fund
the wedding planner's appeal.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.341
(tires screech)
(NPR theme playing)

19:57.490 --> 20:00.459
Do you have a dollar?

20:00.500 --> 20:04.266
Uh... yeah.

20:04.300 --> 20:05.528
Why?

20:05.570 --> 20:06.696
'Cause I need it.

20:06.730 --> 20:08.561
Here you go.

20:08.600 --> 20:12.900
Okay. So I'm your
lawyer now, Kalinda,

20:12.940 --> 20:15.579
and this dollar represents
attorney-client privilege.

20:17.380 --> 20:19.245
Sure.

20:19.280 --> 20:22.477
You faked metadata, and
Diane presented it in court

20:22.520 --> 20:24.488
to get Cary
released, yes?

20:24.520 --> 20:26.283
Yeah.

20:26.320 --> 20:28.015
But Diane didn't know
it was faked.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.516
Yeah.

20:29.560 --> 20:31.585
Anything else?
Look,

20:31.630 --> 20:35.623
after I faked the data, I had
second thoughts about using it.

20:35.660 --> 20:38.766
But Diane took it from my
computer without my knowledge.

20:38.800 --> 20:41.598
I didn't realize
until I got to court

20:41.640 --> 20:44.666
and saw her present it
to the judge.

20:44.710 --> 20:47.270
Okay.

20:47.310 --> 20:49.676
Okay. You don't talk
to anyone about this.

20:49.710 --> 20:50.904
Not Diane.
Not Cary.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.612
And not Wiley.

20:53.650 --> 20:56.619
You just talk to me. Okay?

20:58.920 --> 21:00.911
Do you have any ideas?

21:02.420 --> 21:05.389
No.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.796
You used me.

21:07.830 --> 21:10.628
What?
That wasn't

21:10.670 --> 21:12.467
a think tank exercise.

21:12.500 --> 21:15.037
You were trying to find a wedge
issue against gay marriage.

21:15.070 --> 21:17.561
Of course I was. And I found it.

21:17.610 --> 21:18.634
And you helped me.
Great.

21:18.670 --> 21:20.535
So I was
your liberal guinea pig.

21:20.580 --> 21:21.808
Why is that a bad thing?

21:21.840 --> 21:23.307
If you think that gay marriage

21:23.350 --> 21:25.477
can withstand
all legal assaults,

21:25.510 --> 21:28.547
you should rejoice
in any chance to defend it.
So you're funding

21:28.580 --> 21:31.583
this wedding planner's appeal
now?
Yeah, I am.

21:31.620 --> 21:33.042
It's a stronger case.

21:33.090 --> 21:34.887
And you can help me.

21:34.920 --> 21:38.048
I won't defend her.
You don't
have to.

21:38.090 --> 21:40.524
I wouldn't ask you
to be someone you're not.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.619
I want you to represent
the plaintiff.

21:42.660 --> 21:44.890
Excuse me?
We're havmg

21:44.930 --> 21:48.639
a mock trial here this afternoon
With the real wedding planner.

21:48.670 --> 21:50.900
I want you to sue her.
Destroy her.

21:50.940 --> 21:52.567
See what damage you can do.

21:52.610 --> 21:54.578
So you can improve
your case?
Yeah.

21:54.610 --> 21:56.999
But also so you can destroy it.

21:59.750 --> 22:01.775
Who's my client?

22:01.820 --> 22:03.412
Couldn't find
the real plaintiff.

22:03.450 --> 22:05.315
You'll have to work
with a stand-in.

22:06.720 --> 22:08.756
Who's the judge?

22:08.790 --> 22:10.985
Geoffrey Solomon.
So nice to meet you.

22:11.030 --> 22:13.123
Such an honor, sir.
Diane Lockhart.

22:13.160 --> 22:14.957
I know.
Oh. (chuckles)

22:15.000 --> 22:17.468
I think I read your
Harvard book three times.

22:17.500 --> 22:20.765
Really? That's more than
all my ex-wives put together.

22:20.800 --> 22:23.439
(chuckles)
R.D.

22:23.470 --> 22:26.962
You got to admit,
I'm stacking the deck
against myself here.

22:27.010 --> 22:29.774
Liberal judge,
tough plaintiff's attorney.

22:29.810 --> 22:32.779
You lose,
all your fault.

22:32.810 --> 22:34.675
Thanks.

22:34.720 --> 22:36.847
ELI:
Okay, strategy session.

22:36.880 --> 22:39.519
Two-pronged attack.
Oh, I love the
two prongs.

22:39.550 --> 22:40.653
Even as a kid, we had
two-pronged attacks.

22:40.690 --> 22:42.578
Marissa. Shh.

22:42.620 --> 22:44.656
We have to delay Petra,

22:44.690 --> 22:47.079
even it's only
by 24 hours.
How do we do that?

22:47.130 --> 22:49.451
Hello, Eli.
What do you need?

22:49.500 --> 22:50.922
I just got off the phone
with the governor.

22:50.970 --> 22:53.097
He thinks he can help you
fill out your story.

22:53.130 --> 22:54.734
Really? In what way?

22:54.770 --> 22:56.829
By offering you
an on-screen interview.

22:59.670 --> 23:01.672
(quietly):
You know, this is such BS.

23:01.710 --> 23:03.598
What?
You're just trying to delay me.

23:03.650 --> 23:05.538
Hey, if you don't want
the interview, that's fine.

23:05.580 --> 23:06.740
When can he do it?

23:06.780 --> 23:08.714
There's a chance later tonight.

23:08.750 --> 23:09.739
What kind of chance?

23:09.780 --> 23:11.714
Mm, 60/40.

23:11.750 --> 23:12.682
(sighs)

23:12.720 --> 23:14.711
No restrictions on questions?

23:14.760 --> 23:15.784
None.

23:15.820 --> 23:17.117
Okay.

23:17.160 --> 23:19.720
Get back to me with the time.
Sure will.

23:19.760 --> 23:21.728
So you don't
get back to her?

23:21.760 --> 23:23.728
Oh, you do. 11:30 tonight.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.726
Now prong two.

23:25.770 --> 23:28.432
We pre-spin the e-mails.

23:28.470 --> 23:30.438
What does that mean?

23:30.470 --> 23:31.801
We go to a friendly
reporter.

23:31.840 --> 23:33.102
And reporters who hate Petra.
We give them

23:33.140 --> 23:35.438
the chance to scoop her.
If you don't want

23:35.480 --> 23:37.448
a story to be told, it's
better to tell it yourself.

23:37.480 --> 23:39.107
Well, how do we
tell it ourselves?
What's the worst revelation

23:39.150 --> 23:40.617
and the worst e-mail?

23:40.650 --> 23:42.868
"Alicia, I can't get you
out of my head.

23:42.920 --> 23:44.512
The touch of you,
the taste..."
Okay. Thanks.

23:44.550 --> 23:45.744
It's just flirtation.
There was

23:45.790 --> 23:47.712
no affair,
these are flirtatious e-mails.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.058
Eli.
What?

23:50.090 --> 23:52.650
I think you and I
should talk a little.
Alicia,

23:52.690 --> 23:54.226
I know this is embarrassing
for you,

23:54.260 --> 23:55.989
but we _don't need
to explain your life.

23:56.030 --> 23:58.169
All we need to explain
are these e-mails,

23:58.200 --> 24:02.159
and these e-mails merely suggest
an obsession... a flirtation.

24:02.200 --> 24:04.566
That's gonna be
embarrassing enough.
Are there any e-mails

24:04.610 --> 24:06.669
that suggest
an actual affair?
"Will, you were away

24:06.710 --> 24:07.904
"at depos this week.

24:07.940 --> 24:09.999
"All I could think about
was your hands on me.

24:10.040 --> 24:12.747
Sometimes this feels
too dangerous."

24:13.650 --> 24:15.845
Okay, still pretty
embarrassing,

24:15.880 --> 24:18.041
but merely suggestive
of an act-- you
didn't act on it.

24:18.090 --> 24:19.842
This is just sexting.
And this was
all happening

24:19.890 --> 24:20.857
while your husband
was screwing around.
Yeah,

24:20.890 --> 24:22.482
I don't think we need to
go too deep into that.

24:22.520 --> 24:24.988
Why not? She's right.

24:25.030 --> 24:26.156
Alicia was merely tempted

24:26.190 --> 24:28.499
because her husband
moved out on her,

24:28.530 --> 24:31.863
and, uh, blah-blah.
Okay, I don't think we
need to tear down Peter

24:31.900 --> 24:34.539
to build up Alicia.
It was an affair.

24:34.570 --> 24:36.993
I can't just say this stuff
about Will,

24:37.040 --> 24:38.632
because it wasn't true.

24:39.940 --> 24:42.204
But no_ one_ would
appreCIate it more

24:42.240 --> 24:44.242
if you did than Will.

24:44.280 --> 24:46.043
He always knew what
had to be said.

24:46.080 --> 24:48.571
I can't. I'm sorry.

24:50.120 --> 24:52.213
Now what?

24:52.250 --> 24:54.616
Get Peter to talk to her.

24:57.730 --> 24:59.857
I'm not prejudiced
against gay people.

24:59.890 --> 25:01.994
I-I'm not prejudiced
against anyone.

25:02.030 --> 25:06.160
But I believe the Bible
is the word of God. Period.

25:06.200 --> 25:07.963
And it's not mine to...

25:08.000 --> 25:10.605
ignore or change
as I wish.

25:10.640 --> 25:13.632
Well, honestly, it would
be easier to do that.

25:13.680 --> 25:14.999
I don't want to be

25:15.040 --> 25:16.302
in the position
of turning down business.

25:16.340 --> 25:18.274
I'm a wedding planner.
I need your business,

25:18.310 --> 25:19.800
sir-- I'm...

25:19.850 --> 25:21.647
I'm supposed to...

25:21.680 --> 25:24.217
treat him like the actual guy
who's suing me, right?

25:24.250 --> 25:25.285
That's right,
Ms. Dahl.

25:25.320 --> 25:26.947
Treat this just like court.

25:26.990 --> 25:28.651
Treat me just like a judge.

25:28.690 --> 25:30.726
Look, I certainly

25:30.760 --> 25:34.127
don't want to be sued
for sticking to my beliefs,

25:34.160 --> 25:36.890
but they are
what they are.
Thank you, Ms. Dahl.

25:36.930 --> 25:38.568
Your witness.
So, Ms. Dahl, uh,

25:38.600 --> 25:40.795
you've been a wedding
planner for 12 years,

25:40.840 --> 25:42.296
is that correct?
Yes.

25:42.340 --> 25:44.262
And in all that time, you
have never been approached

25:44.310 --> 25:46.801
about doing a gay
wedding before?
Never. Of course,

25:46.840 --> 25:50.298
there's a homosexual community
in Pocatello,

25:50.340 --> 25:53.673
and my very favorite florist
is gay.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.574
But you are aware
that gay marriage

25:55.620 --> 25:58.316
has been legal in Idaho
since October of 2014.

25:58.350 --> 25:59.886
_ I'm aware
it's legal, yes.

25:59.920 --> 26:01.979
Abortion is legal, too.

26:02.020 --> 26:04.784
It doesn't mean
I have to agree with it.

26:04.830 --> 26:06.320
But you have to
follow the law.

26:06.360 --> 26:08.248
I-I'm not stopping anyone
from getting married.

26:08.300 --> 26:11.098
I just don't want to be the one
to plan their wedding.

26:11.130 --> 26:12.620
That's all.

26:12.670 --> 26:14.638
I'm-I'm helping two people

26:14.670 --> 26:16.991
seal their commitment
to one another before the world

26:17.040 --> 26:18.359
and before God.

26:18.410 --> 26:21.129
I can't do that
ifI don't believe in it.

26:22.380 --> 26:23.847
Ms. Dahl...

26:23.880 --> 26:25.973
how many times did, um, Jesus

26:26.010 --> 26:28.774
condemn
homosexuality?
Objection. Relevance.

26:28.820 --> 26:33.280
She's claiming religion is the
basis of her refusal, Counselor.

26:33.320 --> 26:36.255
I fail to see how the specifics
of that religion

26:36.290 --> 26:37.928
could not be relevant.

26:37.960 --> 26:39.279
Um, Jesus

26:39.330 --> 26:41.150
never condemned

26:41.200 --> 26:42.758
homosexuality.
And how many times

26:42.800 --> 26:44.688
did Jesus condemn divorce?
Three times.

26:44.730 --> 26:48.359
Four times... if you count
Matthew and Mark's account

26:48.400 --> 26:50.163
of the same incident.
Thank you.

26:50.200 --> 26:52.407
Uh, so you've never planned
a wedding...

26:52.440 --> 26:55.079
for a couple that
had previously been married?

26:56.340 --> 26:59.798
Um... I haven't asked.

26:59.850 --> 27:02.011
I... I guess I have.
Well, in fact,

27:02.050 --> 27:03.312
you have planned...

27:03.350 --> 27:06.183
two weddings
in the last year alone

27:06.220 --> 27:08.017
where one or both

27:08.060 --> 27:10.927
of the couple had
previously been married.
That sounds right.

27:10.960 --> 27:13.428
So your religious objection
is selective, at best.

27:13.460 --> 27:14.654
Wouldn't you say?
Objection. Argumentative.

27:14.700 --> 27:16.895
Sustained ._
No more questions.

27:20.470 --> 27:22.131
Let's talk.

27:22.170 --> 27:23.865
You have no choice.

27:23.910 --> 27:25.730
I'm not gonna lie,

27:25.770 --> 27:26.930
especially not for a reporter.

27:26.970 --> 27:29.768
You have to control
the narrative.

27:29.810 --> 27:32.745
To keep me from looking
like the slutty wife.

27:33.820 --> 27:35.674
Yeah.

27:35.720 --> 27:37.745
It'll kill you.
And you.

27:37.790 --> 27:38.939
You'll be the cuckold.

27:38.990 --> 27:41.686
If you don't control
the narrative.

27:41.720 --> 27:45.326
It's kind of odd that we're
discussing this so calmly.

27:45.360 --> 27:47.123
I'm hoping it's maturity.

27:47.160 --> 27:50.027
Really? Is that
what it looks like?

27:50.060 --> 27:52.199
Talking calmly.

27:52.230 --> 27:54.130
Not yelling.

27:54.170 --> 27:56.161
Making sense. Yeah.

27:58.740 --> 28:00.879
Have we come
through the other side?

28:00.910 --> 28:02.434
What other side?

28:02.480 --> 28:03.777
Of anger.

28:03.810 --> 28:06.142
Jealousy.
Disgust.

28:06.180 --> 28:07.943
Did I disgust you?

28:07.980 --> 28:10.813
For a while.

28:10.850 --> 28:13.819
Actually, it's kind of nice
sitting here, drinking together.

28:13.860 --> 28:16.215
It's like watching
two other people drink.

28:16.260 --> 28:18.820
And what do those
two other people do?

28:18.860 --> 28:20.725
They used to be married.

28:20.760 --> 28:22.796
They like each other.

28:22.830 --> 28:25.890
They forgot that they're
supposed to hate each other.

28:25.930 --> 28:27.795
Mm.

28:33.370 --> 28:35.406
Oh, it's not gonna happen.

28:35.440 --> 28:36.976
What?
Sex.

28:37.010 --> 28:38.978
I didn't say a word.
You don't have to.

28:39.010 --> 28:40.739
I can see the look on your face.

28:40.780 --> 28:42.316
I've known you a long time.

28:42.350 --> 28:44.841
A long... long time.

28:44.890 --> 28:47.017
(laughs):
Oh, my God!

28:47.050 --> 28:48.915
You're like an 18-year-old.

28:48.960 --> 28:51.281
Everything's about
where you can stick it.
No.

28:51.330 --> 28:53.082
Listen...

28:53.130 --> 28:55.792
I know you think I've
been a dog, Alicia,

28:55.830 --> 28:58.958
and I know you think I've
been a bad husband, but...

28:59.000 --> 29:02.265
I've never been as bad as
you've wanted me to be.

29:04.940 --> 29:06.931
That's probably true.

29:06.970 --> 29:09.370
And I loved you.

29:09.410 --> 29:11.298
I still love you.

29:14.150 --> 29:16.277
I don't know, Peter.

29:17.850 --> 29:20.341
"Love" is a word
that is so exhausted.

29:20.390 --> 29:22.915
I wish it meant something to me.

29:26.860 --> 29:28.896
Can I just leave it tonight

29:28.930 --> 29:31.763
that I like sitting,
drinking with you here?

29:33.500 --> 29:35.092
Sure.

29:41.140 --> 29:43.574
DIANE: Mr. Andersen,
may I call you Nils?

29:43.610 --> 29:47.569
You're my client's husband,
is that correct?

29:47.610 --> 29:50.272
For the purposes of these
proceedings, yes, I am.

29:50.320 --> 29:52.379
SOLOMON:_We understand
you're playing a part here,

29:52.420 --> 29:55.150
Mr., uh...
My real name's Todd.

29:55.190 --> 29:57.579
SOLOMON:
Fine. Just answer
Ms. Lockhart's questions

29:57.620 --> 29:59.383
as though you were
actually Nils Andersen.

29:59.430 --> 30:00.579
Go ahead.

30:00.630 --> 30:02.598
So you're
Mr. Taylor's husband?

30:02.630 --> 30:04.564
I am. We were married
in January.

30:04.600 --> 30:07.160
Mm. I'd like you
to talk about the day

30:07.200 --> 30:09.134
you were turned away
by Ms. Dahl...

30:09.170 --> 30:11.138
for being gay.
PARTRIDGE:
Objection.

30:11.170 --> 30:12.603
Misstates facts.
Ms. Dahl didn't

30:12.640 --> 30:14.335
turn them away
for being gay.

30:14.380 --> 30:16.940
She simply did not want
to participate in their wedding.

30:16.980 --> 30:18.174
Sustained. But barely.

30:18.210 --> 30:20.599
DIANE:
Mr. Andersen, please tell us

30:20.650 --> 30:23.312
how it felt
to be turned away.

30:23.350 --> 30:25.318
It felt like crap.

30:25.350 --> 30:27.318
Frankly.
And was this
the first time

30:27.350 --> 30:29.318
you'd been turned away
from a business

30:29.360 --> 30:31.954
because of someone's
religious objections?

30:31.990 --> 30:34.026
No. Happens a lot.

30:34.060 --> 30:35.948
And so then
why sue Ms. Dahl

30:36.000 --> 30:37.422
and not anyone else?

30:37.460 --> 30:41.294
I guess it was the straw
that broke the camel's back.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.592
Sometimes that's the way
it feels, you know?

30:43.640 --> 30:46.200
You feel lik_e_a
second-class Citizen,

30:46.240 --> 30:48.003
and especially in a
town like Pocatello,

30:48.040 --> 30:50.270
'cause it's so small.
In a town that small,

30:50.310 --> 30:52.198
was it easy to find
another wedding planner?

30:52.250 --> 30:53.877
(laughs) No. There
are only three.

30:53.920 --> 30:56.309
Maybe-maybe five or six,
if you count nearby towns.

30:56.350 --> 30:57.612
They were all booked.

30:57.650 --> 30:58.446
DIANE:
And if Ms. Dahl

30:58.490 --> 31:00.287
had simply told you
she was booked?

31:00.320 --> 31:01.651
TODD:
I would have understood.

31:01.690 --> 31:03.555
I guess that
would have been a lie,

31:03.590 --> 31:05.455
but it would have hurt less.

31:05.490 --> 31:07.629
It would have been better
than the truth.
Do you feel

31:07.660 --> 31:09.548
that you have suffered
economic harm

31:09.600 --> 31:11.465
due_ to Ms. Dahl's
turning you away?

31:11.500 --> 31:13.934
TODD:
Yes. We had to go
all the way to Boise

31:13.970 --> 31:15.198
to find a wedding planner.

31:15.240 --> 31:16.366
That's 200 miles.

31:16.400 --> 31:17.594
We had to make that drive

31:17.640 --> 31:18.937
four times.
Your Honor?

31:18.970 --> 31:20.972
Could I request a...

31:21.010 --> 31:23.069
a brief recess before we cross?

31:23.110 --> 31:24.247
SOLOMON:
Well, of course.

31:24.280 --> 31:25.599
(gavelbangs)

31:25.650 --> 31:27.299
(indistinct chatter)

31:30.650 --> 31:32.413
(quietly):
How dare you?

31:32.450 --> 31:35.089
I'm sorry?
You cast my nephew

31:35.120 --> 31:36.519
as the lover?
Yes, I did.

31:36.560 --> 31:38.380
You said go
for the jugular.

31:38.430 --> 31:39.954
TODD:
Hey, Uncle Reese.

31:40.960 --> 31:42.552
Hi, buddy.

31:42.600 --> 31:45.023
Will you follow me, please?

31:48.040 --> 31:49.530
Hey.

31:49.570 --> 31:53.506
How did you know how
to change the metadata?

31:53.540 --> 31:55.531
I had a friend show me.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.400
But you did it alone?

31:57.440 --> 31:59.408
Yeah, but he knew
I was doing it.

31:59.450 --> 32:02.078
And nobody else knew
anything about it?
Just him.

32:02.120 --> 32:04.680
Do I need to contain this?

32:05.720 --> 32:07.517
That's an understatement.

32:07.550 --> 32:09.916
*

32:14.600 --> 32:16.022
Whoa.

32:16.060 --> 32:17.652
Where are you off to?

32:17.700 --> 32:20.498
Uh, have you seen Howell?
I thought he was still here.

32:20.530 --> 32:22.669
VVho?
Howell-- the guy who
works on the computer.

32:22.700 --> 32:25.339
Oh, yeah. Wiley
pulled him out
for something.

32:25.370 --> 32:27.258
They're in
the conference room together.

32:27.310 --> 32:27.560
(indistinct conversation nearby)

32:27.610 --> 32:29.669
*

32:37.420 --> 32:39.513
Did you not believe me when
I told you I loved my nephew?

32:39.550 --> 32:41.552
No, I did.
That's why I approached him.
I'm not paying you

32:41.590 --> 32:45.253
to stage a family
therapy session.

32:45.290 --> 32:47.178
I'm not paying you
to use my relative.

32:47.230 --> 32:49.095
I didn't use him--
he wanted to participate.
I'm paying you

32:49.130 --> 32:51.223
to act professionally...
You told me
to go for the jugular.

32:51.270 --> 32:53.067
You told me to get personal.

32:53.100 --> 32:55.261
This is more than personal;
this is an insult, Diane.

32:55.300 --> 32:58.098
I'm sorry, sir, but if you want
to decide on gay marriage,

32:58.140 --> 32:59.562
you have to see
who you're impacting,

32:59.610 --> 33:01.373
and it can't be an actor.

33:02.410 --> 33:03.502
(scoffs softly)

33:04.580 --> 33:06.571
So finish what you started.

33:08.120 --> 33:11.248
Me, my, mo, may.

33:11.290 --> 33:13.246
May. May, there we go.

33:13.290 --> 33:14.552
Very friendly reporter,

33:14.590 --> 33:16.785
dumb as an ox.
(chuckles)

33:16.820 --> 33:18.788
Just keep your answers
to single syllables

33:18.830 --> 33:20.286
and you should be fine.

33:20.330 --> 33:22.252
(clears throat)

33:22.300 --> 33:25.019
Mrs. Florrick, hello.
Mr. Willoughby,

33:25.070 --> 33:27.322
I was thrilled
when Josh told me you said yes.

33:27.370 --> 33:30.294
I was, too. I voted
for you, ma'am.

33:30.340 --> 33:31.364
Unless I shouldn't
say that.

33:31.410 --> 33:33.230
Oh, well, I won't tell anyone.

33:33.270 --> 33:34.532
(laughs)

33:34.580 --> 33:36.172
Good. I like
secrets

33:36.210 --> 33:37.700
and things of that elk.

33:39.110 --> 33:40.646
Ilk?
No, elk.

33:40.680 --> 33:42.113
Things of that elk.

33:43.080 --> 33:44.547
Well...
(clears throat)

33:44.590 --> 33:46.239
shall we get started?

33:46.290 --> 33:48.588
Were Alicia and Mr. Gardner
close? Absolutely.

33:48.620 --> 33:50.087
Interesting
that you're

33:50.120 --> 33:52.680
calling her Alicia
and him Mr. Gardner.

33:52.730 --> 33:54.755
Are you trying
to manufacture some distance

33:54.800 --> 33:57.553
between them, Eli?
No, Kim,

33:57.600 --> 34:00.592
I'm trying to give you
a sense of the reality.
WILLOUGHBY: Ah.

34:00.630 --> 34:03.098
So you did have
a relationship

34:03.140 --> 34:04.767
with Mr. Gardner?

34:04.810 --> 34:08.132
Well, it depends on how
you define "relationship."

34:09.880 --> 34:12.348
As in relating
to other people.
KIM: This is about

34:12.380 --> 34:14.610
Petra Moritz? Seriously?
No, it's not

34:14.650 --> 34:16.743
about Petra per se.
It's about

34:16.780 --> 34:19.180
a journalistic culture
that increasingly kicks sand

34:19.220 --> 34:21.450
over ethical boundaries...
Petra has these e-mails?

34:21.490 --> 34:24.084
Yes. Of course, Petra wants
to go with this story tomorrow,

34:24.130 --> 34:26.781
so if you wanted
to scoop her,

34:26.830 --> 34:28.855
you'd have to get
something out tonight.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.527
WILLOUGHBY:
So...

34:30.560 --> 34:33.120
if there was
nothing going on

34:33.170 --> 34:34.865
between you
and your boss,

34:34.900 --> 34:36.834
how do you explain
these e-mails?

34:36.870 --> 34:38.861
I'm embarrassed to admit it,

34:38.910 --> 34:42.539
but it was... a flirtation.

34:42.580 --> 34:45.708
An innocent one,
but a wrong one.

34:45.750 --> 34:48.173
I was having
difficulties with my husband

34:48.220 --> 34:50.313
at that point, and

34:50.350 --> 34:52.511
I was carried away.

34:52.550 --> 34:54.211
I-I wish that I hadn't,

34:54.260 --> 34:57.184
but I'm deeply embarrassed.

34:57.220 --> 34:58.824
But were you
having difficulties

34:58.860 --> 35:00.851
with your husband
at that point?

35:06.830 --> 35:10.163
Yes, that's right, I was...

35:10.200 --> 35:11.462
having difficulties.

35:11.510 --> 35:14.229
And were you embarrassed?

35:15.640 --> 35:17.779
And I was embarrassed.

35:17.810 --> 35:20.802
Um... I hate to admit it.

35:22.580 --> 35:25.913
Let's talk about your
relationship with Mr. Gardner.

35:25.950 --> 35:27.645
(quiet sigh)

35:28.860 --> 35:29.918
Hey.
What's going on?

35:29.960 --> 35:31.450
What did Wiley ask you?

35:31.490 --> 35:34.288
He asked about the
metadata, but I lied

35:34.330 --> 35:35.922
for you.
Howell, I told you
to tell the truth.

35:35.960 --> 35:37.894
Don't worry, he believed me.
I told him we stumbled

35:37.930 --> 35:40.296
on the metadata while I was
fixing tickets for you

35:40.330 --> 35:42.161
in the Chicago PD
traffic system.

35:42.200 --> 35:45.169
What?
Speeding tickets. It's
something I actually do.

35:45.210 --> 35:47.337
I-I told him I fixed
two tickets for you.

35:47.370 --> 35:49.838
You had four, but
I fixed two to

35:49.880 --> 35:52.348
keep up appearances.
Howell, I don't have
four speeding tickets.

35:52.380 --> 35:54.211
H... I don't even have two.
I will

35:54.250 --> 35:56.275
make it look like you do.
Don't worry so much.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.413
Okay, look, uh...

35:58.450 --> 36:00.714
just tell me everything
that you said, okay?
All right.

36:00.750 --> 36:03.787
PARTRIDGE:
Mr. Andersen. Aren't you
and your husband just picking

36:03.820 --> 36:05.458
a fight here?
Objection, badgering,

36:05.490 --> 36:06.855
inflammatory.
Try it again, Mr. Partridge.

36:06.890 --> 36:09.393
Did you have an ulterior motive

36:09.430 --> 36:10.692
in bringing suit
against Ms. Dahl?

36:10.730 --> 36:12.595
Did I have an ulterior motive?

36:12.630 --> 36:13.892
I guess what
I'm asking is,

36:13.930 --> 36:16.262
were you really so offended
by what she did

36:16.300 --> 36:18.461
or did you see this
as a t_est_case?
Objection.

36:18.510 --> 36:19.738
It's a fair question,
Counselor.

36:19.770 --> 36:21.738
A test?
A case that
would allow

36:21.780 --> 36:23.532
you to change the law
in your favor.

36:23.580 --> 36:24.774
Isn't that,
in fact, why you

36:24.810 --> 36:26.778
brought this case?
No.

36:26.810 --> 36:28.869
I'm in love.

36:28.920 --> 36:30.444
That's the only reason
I'm doing

36:30.480 --> 36:31.640
any of this,
by the way.

36:34.720 --> 36:36.756
Nothing
further.

36:36.790 --> 36:38.428
I have something further.

36:39.360 --> 36:40.452
Why doesn't anyone ever

36:40.490 --> 36:41.798
ask me what I believe?

36:41.830 --> 36:44.765
They take it for granted
I'm not a Christian, but

36:44.800 --> 36:48.497
I am. I believe in God, too.

36:50.370 --> 36:51.860
Am I proud of my wife?

36:51.910 --> 36:53.969
More than you can
imagine, Petra.

36:54.010 --> 36:56.672
Winning an election
in Chicago is...

36:56.710 --> 36:57.972
difficult.

36:58.010 --> 36:59.978
But winning an
election in Chicago

37:00.010 --> 37:02.717
with your integrity
still intact--

37:02.750 --> 37:04.718
well, that's
practically a miracle.

37:04.750 --> 37:06.843
And Alicia Florrick
has kept hers?
Always.

37:09.820 --> 37:11.879
Governor, was your wife
sleeping with her boss,

37:11.930 --> 37:13.420
Will Gardner?

37:13.460 --> 37:15.325
Oh, well, I...

37:15.360 --> 37:17.328
I can't answer that question.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.021
Because you don't want to?

37:19.070 --> 37:22.562
No, no. Because I can't
confirm what you're asking.

37:22.600 --> 37:24.033
Just like, listen,
I can't confirm

37:24.070 --> 37:26.038
that _she was ever at
a Neil Young concert.

37:26.070 --> 37:29.278
I can only confirm what
my wife has told me,

37:29.310 --> 37:31.278
which is she did
not have an affair

37:31.310 --> 37:34.006
with Mr. Gardner.
Governor, we have
copies of e-mails

37:34.050 --> 37:36.018
between your wife
and Mr. Gardner.

37:36.050 --> 37:37.711
Which I'm sure
you'd love to take

37:37.750 --> 37:39.718
as evidence of a scandalous

37:39.750 --> 37:43.789
offic_e romance. But as
my Wife told the reporter

37:43.820 --> 37:45.788
Ted Willoughby, they
are simply an artifact

37:45.830 --> 37:48.628
of a flirtation,
not of an affair.

37:49.930 --> 37:51.591
I'm sorry, what?

37:51.630 --> 37:52.858
As she told the
reporter Ted Willoughby

37:52.900 --> 37:55.733
of Channel 8
just a few hours ago,

37:55.770 --> 37:58.409
those e-mails were part
of an unfortunate

37:58.440 --> 38:00.067
flirtation.
That's it.

38:00.110 --> 38:01.600
Well, uh, surely the-the...

38:01.640 --> 38:05.349
the-the language
in-in these e-mails

38:05.380 --> 38:08.918
is not, uh, everyday talk
between a superior and-and

38:08.950 --> 38:10.747
subordinate.
Well, that's a picture

38:10.780 --> 38:13.510
you seem intent on painting.
I guess what my chief of staff

38:13.550 --> 38:15.518
Eli Gold said to Kim Masters

38:15.560 --> 38:17.380
in their interview
is true.

38:17.420 --> 38:19.388
You're out
to get her.
No, I-I-I...

38:20.660 --> 38:22.548
I am just trying
to reveal the truth,

38:22.600 --> 38:24.397
Governor, and...
Look, Petra,

38:24.430 --> 38:27.695
you've been trying to nail
Alicia for the last three years.

38:27.730 --> 38:30.563
Governor...
You have a grudge
against her. You do.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.909
I mean, if you look at any of
your interviews with her...
Okay, thank you,

38:32.940 --> 38:34.874
thank you. I think we
have what we need here.

38:34.910 --> 38:37.799
Okay. We're good?
Yes, and thank you
for... coming down.

38:37.840 --> 38:39.649
Oh, no, thank you.

38:39.680 --> 38:41.102
I think that went well.

38:41.150 --> 38:43.038
Hey, thank you.
Good to see you.

38:43.080 --> 38:45.082
Okay,
thank you.

38:54.930 --> 38:56.591
ANDREW:
Speeding tickets?

38:56.630 --> 38:58.769
How many?
Uh, four.

38:58.800 --> 39:01.598
Uh, there were
four, but he only

39:01.640 --> 39:03.938
fixed two for me--
I paid for the other two.

39:03.970 --> 39:05.107
Just to keep it kosher?

39:05.140 --> 39:06.459
Yeah.

39:06.510 --> 39:07.738
Where'd you get 'em?

39:07.770 --> 39:09.977
Two in the Loop

39:10.010 --> 39:12.672
and one on the way
back from Springfield.

39:12.710 --> 39:14.575
The other on
the, uh, South Side.

39:14.620 --> 39:15.917
That's exactly what Howell said.

39:15.950 --> 39:17.975
Almost word for word.

39:18.020 --> 39:19.817
I got to go.

39:19.850 --> 39:21.488
There's a puppet show
at the library.

39:21.520 --> 39:23.681
One last thing, Kalinda.

39:25.890 --> 39:27.858
You're caught.

39:27.890 --> 39:29.858
You faked the metadata.

39:32.030 --> 39:33.759
The longer it takes
for you to admit it,

39:33.800 --> 39:35.438
the worse it's gonna be
for you and Diane.

39:35.470 --> 39:37.995
So, I mean, I hate to say this,

39:38.040 --> 39:40.600
'cause I like you, but...

39:40.640 --> 39:42.779
if I were you, I'd come clean.

39:42.810 --> 39:44.129
Come on.

39:45.750 --> 39:48.878
(door opens, closes)

39:48.920 --> 39:50.979
Well, you've given this old

39:51.020 --> 39:53.545
con law professor
a lot to think about.

39:54.220 --> 39:55.949
On the one hand, people

39:55.990 --> 39:57.810
have the right
to their religious views,

39:57.860 --> 39:59.487
and they cannot
and should not

39:59.530 --> 40:01.851
be barred from the marketplace
because of them.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.891
On the other hand,
every citizen has the right

40:03.930 --> 40:05.192
not to be discriminated against

40:05.230 --> 40:06.891
on the basis
of their race,

40:06.930 --> 40:08.568
their color,
their nationality,

40:08.600 --> 40:10.932
and yes,
their sexual orientation.

40:10.970 --> 40:13.131
Well, given all that,

40:13.170 --> 40:16.003
my task is difficult but clear:

40:16.040 --> 40:17.974
I must weigh whether or not

40:18.010 --> 40:19.568
a religious
accommodation

40:19.610 --> 40:21.168
would frustrate the core purpose

40:21.210 --> 40:23.178
of antidiscrimination
law.

40:23.220 --> 40:26.018
And in this case...

40:26.050 --> 40:27.039
I find that it would.

40:27.090 --> 40:29.058
Accordingly,
I must rule

40:29.090 --> 40:30.887
in favor of the plaintiffs,

40:30.920 --> 40:34.083
Mr. Taylor
and Mr. Andersen.

40:35.630 --> 40:37.848
Very well done.

40:44.940 --> 40:48.068
Diane. Can I_ ask
you something?

40:48.110 --> 40:51.034
What do you think would happen

40:51.080 --> 40:53.844
if every case were adjudicated

40:53.880 --> 40:56.144
by someone with a family member

40:56.180 --> 40:59.616
or loved one who'd be affected
by the decision?

40:59.650 --> 41:01.959
Ultimately, perhaps
every case is.

41:01.990 --> 41:04.083
But isn't the law supposed
to be impersonal?

41:04.120 --> 41:06.953
In the sense that it should
be the same for everyone?

41:06.990 --> 41:08.958
You know, otherwise
we're in China,

41:09.000 --> 41:10.991
right? Everything's
determined by who you know.

41:11.030 --> 41:12.998
The law is supposed to be fair.

41:13.030 --> 41:15.692
Not impersonal.

41:15.740 --> 41:16.934
In fact, I would argue

41:16.970 --> 41:19.837
that the law is always personal.

41:19.870 --> 41:22.031
It has to see
the human side, too.

41:22.080 --> 41:23.809
Or else it's meaningless.

41:27.010 --> 41:29.012
Hmm.

41:29.050 --> 41:31.883
You're gonna fund
this defense anyway, aren't you?

41:31.920 --> 41:33.945
The wedding planner?

41:33.990 --> 41:35.252
Yes.

41:35.290 --> 41:37.986
Why?

41:38.020 --> 41:40.955
Three years ago, Barack Obama

41:40.990 --> 41:42.890
was against gay marriage.

41:42.930 --> 41:45.569
So was Bill Clinton.
So was Hillary.

41:45.600 --> 41:48.569
You know, b-basically
every Democratic icon

41:48.600 --> 41:50.739
was lined up
against gay marriage.

41:50.770 --> 41:53.659
Now they're not.
You know?

41:53.710 --> 41:57.134
Because it's politically
expedient for them not to be.

41:57.180 --> 41:59.705
Who knows what they're
gonna be for or against

41:59.750 --> 42:01.718
in another three
years, right?

42:01.750 --> 42:06.187
I like people who stand
by their opinions.

42:06.220 --> 42:09.018
I like people
who stand by their beliefs.

42:09.060 --> 42:11.119
And I think

42:11.160 --> 42:13.128
a religious accommodation

42:13.160 --> 42:15.799
must be made
for people who do that.

42:15.830 --> 42:18.151
You know?
It's the right thing to do.

42:20.030 --> 42:21.668
PETRA:
And as we've discussed,

42:21.700 --> 42:24.567
you're a highly educated,
very confident woman,

42:24.610 --> 42:26.305
but you walk into this

42:26.340 --> 42:28.934
law firm, full of old bulls

42:28.980 --> 42:31.130
and young tigers.
Were you nervous?

42:31.180 --> 42:32.841
Oh, very.

42:32.880 --> 42:35.110
That's nice.
Very human.
Just wait.

42:35.150 --> 42:37.141
PETRA:
During our time together,

42:37.180 --> 42:38.943
Mrs. Florrick talked about
what she had learned

42:38.990 --> 42:40.844
as an attorney.
About the importance

42:40.890 --> 42:43.688
of being smart,
creative, zealous.

42:43.720 --> 42:44.948
But the question surfacing

42:44.990 --> 42:47.925
in recent days is this: was

42:47.960 --> 42:50.224
Alicia Florrick
the candidate too creative,

42:50.260 --> 42:52.865
too zealous, in her pursuit of
the state's attorney's office?

42:52.900 --> 42:55.937
What is she talking about?
I have no idea.

42:55.970 --> 42:58.268
I recently spoke
with a Chicago election monitor,

42:58.300 --> 43:01.337
and serious accusations
are being made

43:01.370 --> 43:03.679
that the voting machines
in some wards

43:03.710 --> 43:06.349
registered votes for Frank Prady

43:06.380 --> 43:08.769
as votes for Alicia Florrick.

43:08.820 --> 43:10.879
Mother of...
PETRA: And that may have
been the difference

43:10.920 --> 43:13.138
in the state's attorney race.
What?
Oh...

43:13.190 --> 43:16.216
we are all in trouble now.
PETRA: Was the election stolen?
For now we don't know...
