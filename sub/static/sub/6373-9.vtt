00:17.334 --> 00:18.960
Oh! You're up.

00:22.524 --> 00:23.649
Good morning.

00:25.131 --> 00:26.485
What am I doing here?

00:26.495 --> 00:29.549
I picked you up from a bar
on Union Square last night.

00:30.462 --> 00:33.784
Apparently, you sampled a
lot of their fancy scotches.

00:33.794 --> 00:34.903
And...

00:35.960 --> 00:38.113
what-- what happened
after that?

00:38.123 --> 00:39.787
I showed up to take you home,
but then I remembered

00:39.817 --> 00:41.982
that it's very easy to choke on
your own vomit, and you live alone,

00:42.016 --> 00:43.460
so I brought you here instead.

00:47.690 --> 00:49.974
You slept... where?

00:49.987 --> 00:51.536
In your arms.

00:53.546 --> 00:55.236
Relax, I'm kidding.

00:55.249 --> 00:57.101
On the couch, downstairs.

00:57.265 --> 00:58.633
Oh, great.

00:58.645 --> 01:01.390
I mean, th-thanks.

01:01.408 --> 01:02.671
So how are you feeling?

01:02.687 --> 01:06.440
Like, uh, like my tongue's
wearing a sweater.

01:06.457 --> 01:09.063
Could you please not do that?

01:09.078 --> 01:10.910
How did things go with Sofia?

01:11.696 --> 01:13.440
Sofia left...

01:13.868 --> 01:16.072
with her perfect boyfriend,

01:16.087 --> 01:20.153
who probably proposed to
her with his perfect chin.

01:20.165 --> 01:21.142
What?

01:21.157 --> 01:22.992
She wants a family, Betty.

01:23.006 --> 01:24.880
She wants to settle down,

01:24.897 --> 01:27.490
drive a car with a backseat.

01:27.846 --> 01:29.661
That doesn't sound so terrible.

01:29.677 --> 01:33.493
It does when she doesn't see you as
the guy she wants to do that with.

01:35.297 --> 01:37.101
I'm not that guy, am I?

01:38.396 --> 01:41.630
I mean, maybe you could just
stick to girls who love 2-seaters.

01:41.786 --> 01:43.992
You never called back
that one danish girl.

01:44.005 --> 01:46.023
Don't try and fix this, Betty.

01:46.526 --> 01:48.003
I lost her.

01:48.015 --> 01:49.733
I'm not trying to fix it.

01:49.746 --> 01:51.892
I'm just saying, look at me.

01:51.905 --> 01:54.390
Last summer I was mopping
up at a cat hospital.

01:54.408 --> 01:57.642
Today I'm an executive
assistant at "Mode" magazine.

01:57.655 --> 01:59.823
A lot can change
in a short time.

02:01.658 --> 02:03.822
Don't choke. Don't choke.
Don't choke.

02:06.298 --> 02:07.922
No, stay.

02:13.278 --> 02:15.260
I don't get it.
It was a holiday.

02:15.278 --> 02:17.501
Clearly, some people thought
it would be an ideal time

02:17.518 --> 02:20.160
to use my office
as a prom limo.

02:20.177 --> 02:22.501
Animals. What'd they do?

02:22.516 --> 02:24.483
They polished off
six gift baskets,

02:24.498 --> 02:26.582
rifled through my drawers

02:26.596 --> 02:29.502
and made phone
calls from my desk.

02:29.516 --> 02:32.333
What's wrong with people?

02:32.346 --> 02:34.743
Couldn't they be satisfied
with watching the parade

02:34.758 --> 02:37.401
and "The sound of music" for,
like, the 80th time?

02:37.418 --> 02:39.551
Is that how you spend
your holidays, Marc?

02:39.566 --> 02:41.982
In Schenectady with my family.

02:41.997 --> 02:43.261
And you came back...

02:43.276 --> 02:45.482
Uh, right before the Von
Trapps escape the nazis.

02:45.498 --> 02:48.882
If I leave before "Edelweiss," I
can be home and in bed by midnight.

02:48.895 --> 02:54.210
Marc, I found this
under my chaise.

02:54.648 --> 02:57.581
Why are you calling
me from the office?

02:59.915 --> 03:01.951
She knows we called
from the office.

03:12.448 --> 03:15.640
Who on this staff would
willingly eat something

03:15.657 --> 03:19.573
that's 15 grams of
fat per serving?

03:19.796 --> 03:22.920
Uh, ooh, gee, um...

03:23.556 --> 03:24.970
I'll get it.

03:25.148 --> 03:27.541
You study the teeth imprints.

03:30.438 --> 03:32.962
Hello? Ah, Bradford.

03:32.978 --> 03:34.892
How was your holiday?

03:35.777 --> 03:40.191
Oh, no, I'll...
I'll turn it on now.

03:41.485 --> 03:45.692
Word has it that Tim, Chloe and
baby Chutney will stop in Gotham

03:45.706 --> 03:48.122
for a layover on
their way to Prague.

03:48.138 --> 03:51.071
Does this mean that New Yorkers
will be the first to lay eyes

03:51.085 --> 03:53.083
on the mysterious baby girl?

03:53.095 --> 03:55.772
I hope so, 'cause this New
Yorker is starting to think

03:55.786 --> 04:00.302
that miss Chloe has been "nursing"
a fat slab of swiss cheese.

04:00.316 --> 04:04.150
Wait, are you saying they chose
us to reveal baby Chutney?

04:04.266 --> 04:06.052
Fabulous.

04:06.896 --> 04:09.442
There's the writer contracts
that I have to get out today--

04:09.455 --> 04:10.853
I thought it was
a paid holiday.

04:10.868 --> 04:12.602
I'm only gonna be
there till noon.

04:12.618 --> 04:13.632
Right.

04:13.646 --> 04:17.301
Dad, we've got deadlines,
and Daniel's been distracted.

04:17.315 --> 04:19.801
If I wait till monday to finish
the paperwork, it'll be too late.

04:19.836 --> 04:21.902
How does your boss take his coffee,
on the rocks?

04:21.916 --> 04:24.772
Shh, dad, please.
Just let him sleep.

04:24.786 --> 04:26.882
I'm sure I'll be back
before he even gets up.

04:26.897 --> 04:29.131
Oh, but if I'm not, just,
you know, offer him breakfast.

04:29.135 --> 04:30.210
Be nice.

04:30.227 --> 04:31.813
Oh, and whatever you do,

04:31.828 --> 04:34.430
don't talk about last night,
don't even mention her name.

04:34.448 --> 04:36.323
He's in really bad shape.

04:36.346 --> 04:38.190
Who is this woman anyway?

04:38.207 --> 04:40.333
What? You don't recognize me?

04:40.345 --> 04:44.093
I'm "Memoir of a Geisha"...
before she shaved.

04:44.107 --> 04:45.772
You know,
I kinda miss the good old days

04:45.788 --> 04:47.582
when you snuck out in 
the middle of the night.

04:47.618 --> 04:49.883
Oh, but then we
would've missed this.

04:51.125 --> 04:52.210
What do you think, Betty?

04:52.227 --> 04:53.903
Can you put me on the
cover of your magazine?

04:53.938 --> 04:56.082
Well, I don't really have much
say about what goes on the cover.

04:56.115 --> 04:57.812
Sorry. Good-bye.

04:57.825 --> 04:58.861
Bye.

04:58.965 --> 05:01.403
You, uh, staying for breakfast?

05:01.415 --> 05:02.743
Yeah, sure.

05:02.755 --> 05:04.212
Smells great.

05:05.255 --> 05:07.393
You're  a guest in this house.

05:14.655 --> 05:16.053
Sofia?

05:17.237 --> 05:18.630
Hola,  Betty.

05:18.706 --> 05:19.780
What's wrong?

05:19.795 --> 05:22.610
Oh, nothing. I just didn't expect
to see anybody here today.

05:22.628 --> 05:24.932
Oh, when you're launching
a magazine in six weeks,

05:24.946 --> 05:26.772
no one gets a friday off.

05:27.208 --> 05:29.380
Is Daniel coming in, too?

05:29.988 --> 05:33.470
Um... I-I'm not sure.

05:34.787 --> 05:36.393
I'm leaving him a note.

05:36.405 --> 05:38.543
Well, I'll tell
him you stopped by.

05:40.117 --> 05:43.511
Betty, I left him three
messages since yesterday,

05:43.528 --> 05:46.141
and he has not returned
one of my phone calls,

05:46.325 --> 05:48.133
and I'm leaving
tonight for Maine.

05:48.145 --> 05:49.283
What's in Maine?

05:49.295 --> 05:50.860
Hunter found some house--

05:50.878 --> 05:53.260
six bedrooms, huge porch.

05:53.277 --> 05:55.973
Says it's the perfect place
to raise our future family.

05:55.987 --> 05:57.300
Sounds nice.

05:57.586 --> 06:00.933
Yeah, knowing Hunter,
he probably found some old captain

06:00.945 --> 06:04.223
to  marry us in a lobster
boat this weekend.

06:04.387 --> 06:05.693
Marry?

06:07.398 --> 06:09.130
Great. Congratulations.

06:09.145 --> 06:11.041
Don't forget to pack
your Dramamine.

06:14.528 --> 06:18.442
Betty, I don't know what to do.

06:18.836 --> 06:24.232
Listen, I'm not sure
I even want to go.

06:26.546 --> 06:27.522
Why?

06:27.535 --> 06:29.732
Well, it's complicated.

06:29.938 --> 06:34.470
A month ago,
I didn't know Daniel.

06:34.515 --> 06:37.221
Well, have you told him?
Does he know how you feel?

06:37.238 --> 06:38.360
Daniel?

06:38.376 --> 06:41.693
Daniel "so many women,
so little time" Meade?

06:42.595 --> 06:44.580
I don't think it would matter.

06:45.487 --> 06:46.901
Do you?

06:46.917 --> 06:48.763
What? No. I-I-I don't know.

06:48.777 --> 06:51.233
I-I just came here to work.
I'm--I'm working.

06:51.247 --> 06:52.940
I have to get back to work.

06:55.017 --> 06:56.363
Me, too.

06:56.377 --> 06:58.380
Got a plane to catch.

07:04.118 --> 07:06.360
Hey, papi,
can you bring one for Justin?

07:06.370 --> 07:07.294
Coming right up.

07:07.307 --> 07:09.336
Oh, don't forget
the salt, please.

07:09.536 --> 07:10.736
Yep.

07:12.909 --> 07:16.141
So what are we putting
under our tree, nothing?

07:16.158 --> 07:17.943
Maybe we won't have
one this year.

07:17.957 --> 07:20.233
Not everybody has a
Christmas tree, right?

07:20.247 --> 07:22.710
Sure, but they're jewish.

07:26.196 --> 07:28.963
We are putting every penny
we got towards helping papi.

07:28.975 --> 07:29.883
Do you hear me?

07:29.895 --> 07:33.163
Hilda, one tree is not
gonna break the bank.

07:33.176 --> 07:34.882
We always had one.

07:35.968 --> 07:37.410
Hey, boss.

07:39.487 --> 07:40.563
You okay?

07:40.577 --> 07:42.231
Hey, Mr. Suarez.

07:43.776 --> 07:45.001
How are you?

07:45.695 --> 07:48.303
I'm cooking.
Stay for breakfast.

07:48.317 --> 07:50.523
Oh, I'm not much of
a breakfast person.

07:50.535 --> 07:51.980
I should probably
just head home.

07:51.998 --> 07:53.201
No.

07:53.438 --> 07:55.220
No, no, no, no, no, no.

07:55.468 --> 07:58.581
Betty told me to
feed and water you.

07:58.596 --> 08:01.261
Stay for coffee.
You look like hell.

08:01.277 --> 08:03.482
Come on. There you go.

08:03.498 --> 08:05.292
Come on in and sit down.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.390
How about right there?

08:09.665 --> 08:12.172
Good job. Okay.

08:12.985 --> 08:14.520
I'll get you a plate.

08:20.618 --> 08:24.091
Yo, I'm Santos, Hilda's, uh...

08:25.057 --> 08:26.581
Justin's father.

08:26.596 --> 08:29.860
Oh, right. Uh, Daniel.

08:29.878 --> 08:31.952
Meade. Yeah, I know.

08:31.967 --> 08:33.962
I saw your picture
in the "Post" once.

08:33.977 --> 08:37.082
You dated Angelina when she was
in between boyfriends, right?

08:38.025 --> 08:40.293
A real player, bro.

08:45.215 --> 08:46.493
Here you go.

08:48.505 --> 08:50.091
How about that?

08:51.207 --> 08:52.443
Enjoy.

08:56.328 --> 08:58.502
It's the second
door on the left.

09:05.177 --> 09:08.093
Oh, hi, Mr. Meade.
You scared me.

09:08.105 --> 09:09.512
Did Daniel get my message?

09:09.525 --> 09:12.123
- Regarding...
- Baby Chutney.

09:12.157 --> 09:15.401
Tim and Chloe have given us
a 3-hour window to shoot her.

09:15.415 --> 09:17.061
Tim and Chloe?

09:17.078 --> 09:20.233
"Mode's" getting the first
pictures of baby Chutney? Shut up!

09:20.248 --> 09:22.511
I mean, that's really exciting.

09:22.526 --> 09:25.173
Well, it will be if my
son can pull this off.

09:25.188 --> 09:26.780
Is here, isn't he?

09:26.798 --> 09:28.552
Wilhelmina has called
in some staffers,

09:28.568 --> 09:30.610
and she's on her way
to greet the plane.

09:30.647 --> 09:34.341
Bradford, I was thinking we
approach this from a family angle.

09:34.356 --> 09:37.711
You know how the firstborn
changes everything?

09:37.795 --> 09:39.413
Yeah, I like that.

09:40.027 --> 09:42.521
Tell Daniel that since,
uh, we're short staffed,

09:42.538 --> 09:44.811
Sofia has volunteered
to write the copy.

09:44.827 --> 09:46.440
They'll make a great team.

09:50.705 --> 09:53.610
No, I can't be there, Betty.

09:53.778 --> 09:55.590
I'm total mess.

09:55.607 --> 09:57.193
Tell her I'm a mess.

09:57.426 --> 09:59.993
Betty, he's a mess.

10:00.477 --> 10:04.491
He can't hold down my huevos,
and he's got a fever.

10:05.667 --> 10:06.773
Baby who?

10:06.785 --> 10:09.821
Oh, no. Baby Chutney.

10:09.838 --> 10:10.811
Baby Chutney?

10:10.825 --> 10:13.391
Tim and Chloe have
given us three hours,

10:13.407 --> 10:15.412
and Sofia's come up
with a family angle.

10:15.428 --> 10:17.830
Yeah, Tim and Chloe--
explain that one.

10:17.845 --> 10:19.951
He sleeps with every woman
who brings him coffee,

10:19.966 --> 10:21.993
and all of a sudden he's Mr.
Family man?

10:22.007 --> 10:23.693
Daniel, are you still drunk?

10:24.186 --> 10:26.752
Wait, did--did you say Sofia?

10:26.777 --> 10:29.422
My Sofia?
What, is Hunter the chin there, too?

10:29.436 --> 10:31.701
Daniel, you have to be here.

10:31.716 --> 10:34.542
I am sick, Betty.
I'm still drunk.

10:34.556 --> 10:36.482
I can't face her.

10:36.596 --> 10:39.983
Besides, what do I know about
shooting a family spread, huh?

10:40.528 --> 10:42.213
Just cover for me.

10:42.228 --> 10:44.712
No. I can't take
charge of this.

10:44.728 --> 10:46.800
What is going on over there?

10:46.816 --> 10:49.240
Uh, the tree I
ordered just arrived.

10:49.256 --> 10:50.151
The what?

10:50.166 --> 10:51.962
The Christmas tree
for your family.

10:51.977 --> 10:53.433
Why did you get us a tree?

10:53.448 --> 10:56.421
Threw up in four rooms of your house.
It's the least I can do, huh?

10:56.436 --> 10:58.330
- Well, how did you--
- It was no big deal.

10:58.345 --> 11:00.552
I just called the
company florist.

11:00.766 --> 11:03.270
Oh, my god!

11:08.295 --> 11:10.781
Daniel. Daniel?

11:12.606 --> 11:14.113
Where is he?

11:14.717 --> 11:16.223
He's on his way.

11:16.455 --> 11:17.850
Okay.

11:22.126 --> 11:24.770

11:25.258 --> 11:26.731
www.forom.com

11:35.477 --> 11:36.633
Is he here?

11:36.785 --> 11:38.492
I'm sorry. You are...

11:38.505 --> 11:41.693
This is Bruno... Jacobs.

11:42.705 --> 11:44.241
Stylist.

11:44.957 --> 11:47.180
I was called in to help
him coordinate today.

11:47.198 --> 11:49.633
Of course. Mr. Bruno, hi.
I'm Betty. It's--

11:49.648 --> 11:50.742
Where's Daniel?

11:50.758 --> 11:53.741
He... is... on his way.

11:53.755 --> 11:57.620
He's... getting a gift
for baby Chutney.

11:57.637 --> 11:59.250
Isn't that your job?

11:59.316 --> 12:01.581
Daniel is very hands-on.

12:01.595 --> 12:03.723
The clock is ticking.
We need to talk concept.

12:03.738 --> 12:06.740
You know, we were thinking of
something family oriented.

12:06.756 --> 12:08.561
They're movie stars.

12:08.578 --> 12:11.802
Okay, um...
well, what are your thoughts?

12:11.816 --> 12:14.573
Uh, Daniel requested that
you share them with me.

12:15.706 --> 12:16.992
Really?

12:18.877 --> 12:22.251
Well, my first
thought is coffee.

12:22.266 --> 12:23.782
I like it hot.

12:24.396 --> 12:25.573
Okay.

12:25.826 --> 12:28.451
Here, drink this.

12:28.528 --> 12:29.972
It'll help.

12:30.268 --> 12:32.791
Thanks. I really
appreciate this.

12:32.807 --> 12:36.173
Oh, well, we really appreciate the tree.
It's so nice.

12:36.186 --> 12:39.551
This isn't, uh,
Betty's bonus, right?

12:39.566 --> 12:42.662
I say we take the door off the
hinges and cut off some branches.

12:42.677 --> 12:44.701
Yo, Justin, you got a saw?

12:45.298 --> 12:47.431
I got it. I got it.

12:47.636 --> 12:50.212
You guys did an awesome
article last december

12:50.226 --> 12:52.060
on how to make
icicles out of mylar.

12:52.078 --> 12:53.550
I saved that issue.

12:53.598 --> 12:54.551
Really? 

12:54.567 --> 12:57.300
Well, more for the article on
that old queen of hungary.

12:57.317 --> 12:59.223
I didn't know you
were into history.

12:59.235 --> 13:02.312
She used to sleep wrapped up
in a sheet with raw steaks.

13:02.325 --> 13:06.121
It removed her toxins.
Her skin was flawless.

13:06.137 --> 13:08.401
- Flawless?
- Flawless.

13:09.517 --> 13:11.100
Good for her.

13:13.015 --> 13:14.360
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:14.378 --> 13:15.923
Tell me something.

13:16.045 --> 13:18.871
How  long does Santos
plan on sticking around?

13:18.887 --> 13:20.891
Look, papi,
I can take care of myself.

13:20.907 --> 13:23.162
It's not you I'm worried about.

13:23.177 --> 13:25.840
Well, Justin could use another
man in his life right now.

13:25.907 --> 13:28.882
What happens when this "man"
disappears again for three years?

13:28.898 --> 13:32.551
Ay, back off, would you?

13:32.566 --> 13:35.690
Give him a chance
to be a father.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.603
We can dump the water
on her from behind.

13:45.615 --> 13:48.050
We can shoot high-speed
from a low angle.

13:48.066 --> 13:49.340
Genius.

13:49.358 --> 13:52.613
Love using that mermaid movie
Chloe did for inspiration.

13:52.626 --> 13:55.523
If the baby doesn't see
the water coming... bam.

13:55.535 --> 13:57.192
Pure drama.

13:57.217 --> 13:59.622
You're gonna dump
water on the baby?

14:01.808 --> 14:04.030
Is that the concept?

14:08.387 --> 14:11.713
Do you have a nondairy creamer?

14:12.415 --> 14:15.042
Is everybody on
board with this?

14:15.178 --> 14:17.863
I mean, I personally--

14:17.878 --> 14:22.000
I think that a wet baby ambush
could be very dynamic...

14:24.357 --> 14:27.163
but--but Daniel might not.

14:29.826 --> 14:32.773
I'm--I'm gonna check
on that creamer. Okay.

14:35.616 --> 14:39.203
Of course I approve, Betty.
This is Bruno Jacobs, hon.

14:39.215 --> 14:41.553
He styled Madonna while
she was giving birth,

14:41.565 --> 14:43.411
made her belly sweat
look like diamonds.

14:43.425 --> 14:46.163
Tell Daniel to get out of the
way and let him do his work.

14:57.815 --> 15:00.303
Will you excuse me
for just a second?

15:07.447 --> 15:10.933
What about Amanda?
Where did she spend her holiday?

15:12.507 --> 15:14.881
I think she went to Vermont.

15:15.848 --> 15:18.472
Oh, I can't wait to
meet baby Chutney.

15:18.488 --> 15:21.120
I hope she spits up on something
so I can sell it on the internet.

15:21.128 --> 15:23.963
Now how could Amanda get
back from Vermont so fast?

15:23.976 --> 15:25.560
It doesn't make sense.

15:25.766 --> 15:31.090
I, uh--oh, excuse-y.
It's Amanda. Hello?

15:31.565 --> 15:34.781
Oh, it's just a text message.

15:35.307 --> 15:39.153
"Forget the cashews. You're the
one who had to be Nancy Drew."

15:39.996 --> 15:41.430
Look, Willie, I can explain--

15:41.446 --> 15:43.473
You held that nut in your
hand and you lied to me.

15:43.488 --> 15:45.663
- I never touched your cashews.
- Oh, no, that was Amanda.

15:45.695 --> 15:49.561
You were the one who made the
phone calls. You are Nancy Drew.

15:49.625 --> 15:51.283
I didn't learn
anything, though.

15:51.295 --> 15:53.112
Then why are you wheezing?

15:54.215 --> 15:58.790
You have a friend in a surgical
hospital that likes to chat.

15:59.215 --> 16:00.420
About what?

16:00.437 --> 16:02.741
I don't know.
I was drinking and dialing.

16:02.755 --> 16:05.691
Oh, you are done
dialing, Nancy.

16:06.016 --> 16:08.821
Oh! Oh,
I still had free minutes.

16:09.675 --> 16:11.540
Why are we getting off here?

16:11.555 --> 16:13.843
Ma'am, we have a flat. Sorry.

16:14.066 --> 16:18.593
We can't stop now. I-I have to go
meet baby Chutney on the tarmac!

16:21.525 --> 16:23.961
Dad, is he there?

16:23.975 --> 16:25.983
I need to talk to him.
Is he upright?

16:25.995 --> 16:28.523
Technically, yes.

16:33.225 --> 16:36.273
Is that him?
Betty, let me talk to him.

16:36.386 --> 16:38.113
Let me talk to him.

16:38.698 --> 16:42.183
Is that Sofia?
Don't--don't tell her it's me.

16:42.197 --> 16:43.683
I can't deal with this today.

16:43.697 --> 16:46.123
Uh--Daniel, Daniel, I can't hear you.
You're breaking up--

16:46.135 --> 16:48.272
I need to ask him--
I need his input on this paper.

16:48.288 --> 16:50.730
Just call me when you get off the
gift wrapping floor. Okay, 'bye.

16:50.765 --> 16:52.121
Sorry.

16:52.265 --> 16:53.811
Did he ask about me?

16:53.826 --> 16:56.872
Uh, maybe. I could--
I couldn't hear very well.

16:58.255 --> 16:59.642
Thanks.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.193
Brilliant.

17:08.295 --> 17:10.483
Metal is a nice homage.

17:10.494 --> 17:13.613
Tim did that King Arthur
movie in armor last year.

17:13.625 --> 17:17.481
Oh, if you freeze-frame the fight scene,
he is not wearing a codpiece.

17:17.494 --> 17:18.311
I know.

17:18.328 --> 17:20.092
Can this be tailored?

17:20.396 --> 17:22.393
Maybe with a blow torch.

17:22.568 --> 17:25.142
Let's go with this. It's edgy.

17:25.157 --> 17:28.852
You know, don't you think that we
should wait for Daniel's opinion?

17:28.865 --> 17:30.392
Where is he?

17:30.406 --> 17:32.813
He's coming.
Uh, but I just don't think

17:32.825 --> 17:35.202
that he's gonna go for
a baby in chain-link.

17:35.217 --> 17:36.953
It's chain mail.

17:36.965 --> 17:38.940
Whatever. If she
tries to move in that,

17:38.955 --> 17:40.562
she's gonna need first aid.

17:40.575 --> 17:43.423
You know?
'Cause their skin, it's--it's tender.

17:43.435 --> 17:45.481
Is this your opinion,
or Daniel's?

17:45.495 --> 17:46.593
Daniel's.

17:46.608 --> 17:49.243
Really? I could have
sworn it was yours.

17:49.256 --> 17:50.960
And frankly, 
I'm not about to take critiques

17:50.998 --> 17:53.711
from someone who trims
her bangs with a lighter.

17:53.725 --> 17:57.153
Your boss has five minutes to get here,
or he forfeits his vote.

18:00.855 --> 18:02.013
Look.

18:03.135 --> 18:04.220
You made that?

18:04.235 --> 18:07.663
No, that was Betty, years ago,
from her glitter period.

18:09.735 --> 18:11.631
Justin, hand me that, will you?

18:13.306 --> 18:15.870
What's that supposed to be,
a cow?

18:15.926 --> 18:17.483
R eindeer.

18:17.805 --> 18:20.200
My late wife made this for me,

18:20.215 --> 18:22.001
our first Christmas
in New York.

18:22.457 --> 18:25.431
Her feet were always cold,
so she put boots on everything.

18:25.445 --> 18:27.743
So most of these are homemade?

18:27.808 --> 18:29.250
Oh, yeah.

18:29.265 --> 18:31.013
Careful with that.

18:31.027 --> 18:32.661
It's older than you.

18:32.847 --> 18:34.660
Your mother was busy.

18:34.676 --> 18:38.251
I made this one when I
was pregnant with Justin.

18:38.266 --> 18:40.093
Here come the tears...
just watch.

18:40.106 --> 18:41.590
Listen, you. I'm proud of this.

18:41.606 --> 18:44.182
It took me weeks to
weave this straw.

18:44.196 --> 18:46.631
Hormones'll make you
do strange things.

18:46.646 --> 18:49.130
It was the only thing in the
house she didn't try to eat.

18:49.686 --> 18:51.642
It's not funny.

18:55.637 --> 18:57.151
You wanna hang it?

18:57.165 --> 18:59.053
Uh, sure, yeah.

18:59.107 --> 19:03.012
I'm... kind a new at this.

19:05.058 --> 19:07.373
I should... I...

19:07.468 --> 19:09.991
I guess I should start
at the top, or...

19:10.006 --> 19:12.383
um... bottom?

19:14.918 --> 19:15.961
Middle?

19:15.975 --> 19:17.731
Your family never
had Christmas trees?

19:17.745 --> 19:20.192
Oh, yeah, sure.
We had amazing trees--

19:20.206 --> 19:24.732
uh, electric trains running underneath,
Waterford icicles,

19:24.746 --> 19:26.160
you name it.

19:26.337 --> 19:29.361
Just, uh,
weren't allowed to touch anything.

19:39.426 --> 19:40.640
How does that feel?

19:40.655 --> 19:42.451
Ow. Like my braces slipped.

19:42.468 --> 19:44.410
I can't believe any mother would
let her baby wear that thing.

19:44.448 --> 19:46.510
Oh, we're gonna have to find
something safer for the baby to wear,

19:46.545 --> 19:48.051
like maybe a plastic bag.

19:48.068 --> 19:50.230
Well, isn't there anything in here
that could work for a 6 month old?

19:50.266 --> 19:52.213
No, nothing, nothing--
yes, there is--

19:52.226 --> 19:54.103
Kate Moss' spandex dress.

19:54.116 --> 19:57.721
No, no, no, 'cause I'm gonna
have to take it out a bit.

19:58.905 --> 20:02.840
Daniel! Hey, listen, so they wanna
put baby Chutney in chain mail,

20:02.857 --> 20:05.453
which would rust once
they soaked her.

20:05.468 --> 20:06.811
That's great.

20:06.825 --> 20:08.920
No, no, no.
It's not great, Daniel.

20:08.938 --> 20:10.673
If she burps,
she'll get lockjaw.

20:10.687 --> 20:12.163
Are you feeling any better?

20:12.178 --> 20:13.353
A little.

20:13.788 --> 20:15.830
I'm decorating your tree.

20:15.846 --> 20:18.343
You know, your family
has a lot of cool ornaments.

20:18.356 --> 20:20.513
I really like your
glitter period.

20:20.527 --> 20:21.561
What?

20:21.575 --> 20:23.730
This is all so
new to me, Betty.

20:24.027 --> 20:26.803
You know, my family,
we'd go away on Thanksgiving,

20:26.815 --> 20:30.353
we'd come back on sunday and
the whole tree was done...

20:30.705 --> 20:32.293
by professionals.

20:32.305 --> 20:34.340
Daniel, look.
We need decisions.

20:34.356 --> 20:36.622
The whole thing was an
excuse for a photo op.

20:36.635 --> 20:38.110
Are we gonna do this, or what?
Because I'm gonna have

20:38.147 --> 20:39.760
to rent a soldering gun.

20:39.775 --> 20:40.780
Daniel--

20:40.797 --> 20:43.551
Betty, come on. You're always saying
you want more responsibility.

20:43.567 --> 20:44.642
You can do this.

20:44.658 --> 20:47.352
And by the time I got in from Queens,
it would all be over anyway.

20:47.368 --> 20:49.040
Betty, you're the man.

20:49.056 --> 20:50.321
Shoot.

20:50.338 --> 20:52.220
Is it three cranberries,
then a popcorn,

20:52.238 --> 20:54.263
or three popcorns,
then a cranberry?

20:54.275 --> 20:57.072
I'm not sure, but you better ask Justin,
because he's very particular.

20:57.216 --> 20:58.611
What did he say?

20:58.626 --> 21:00.423
He likes what I
do with glitter,

21:00.448 --> 21:03.333
and apparently, I'm the man.

21:08.485 --> 21:11.163
I need to get to JFK, fast.

21:11.178 --> 21:13.670
No highway, just side streets.

21:14.236 --> 21:15.793
Now go.

21:16.688 --> 21:18.813
Okay, the only reason I was
there is 'cause I didn't want

21:18.845 --> 21:20.453
to go home for Thanksgiving.

21:20.466 --> 21:22.200
My mom keeps trying to
set me up with this girl

21:22.236 --> 21:24.060
who plays the organ
at their church,

21:24.077 --> 21:28.331
and I just wanted to
watch the parade from...

21:29.408 --> 21:31.230
a safe place.

21:33.786 --> 21:35.381
Please say something.

21:35.395 --> 21:37.910
You know the name
of the hospital.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.660
You know the
frequency of my calls.

21:43.078 --> 21:47.430
You stepped way over the
line this time, Marc.

21:48.218 --> 21:50.953
I don't know whether I
can protect you anymore.

21:50.986 --> 21:52.790
Protect me from what?

21:52.806 --> 21:57.800
The person you were trying
to call is not amused.

21:58.125 --> 22:00.321
We have a big problem.

22:00.335 --> 22:01.400
We do?

22:01.416 --> 22:04.391
The publicist just sent me
a sneak peek at the kid.

22:04.406 --> 22:06.622
I'm gonna need five hours--
a minimum of four.

22:06.635 --> 22:07.493
That's not possible.

22:07.505 --> 22:09.023
Well, then, it can't happen.

22:09.038 --> 22:09.733
Why?

22:09.745 --> 22:12.060
Because baby Chutney
is butt-ugly.

22:12.077 --> 22:13.503
We're talking scary.

22:13.515 --> 22:16.850
Well maybe they just sent you a
bad picture. Maybe it was fuzzy.

22:16.868 --> 22:19.183
No, the baby is fuzzy.

22:19.198 --> 22:21.113
This child fell out
of the ugly tree

22:21.128 --> 22:23.800
and hit every single
branch on the way down.

22:24.016 --> 22:26.092
Well, we're talking
about a baby girl.

22:26.108 --> 22:27.931
Who's going to
require extra lighting

22:27.946 --> 22:30.292
and yards of tape
for those ears.

22:30.307 --> 22:31.763
Well, they need
to catch a plane.

22:31.778 --> 22:34.630
What don't you understand?
This kid is hideous.

22:34.647 --> 22:37.891
Well, maybe your concept of what's
beautiful is a little narrow.

22:38.817 --> 22:40.342
Excuse me?

22:40.358 --> 22:43.822
If you can't find the wonder
and pure joy of a baby,

22:43.835 --> 22:47.141
and think that it's edgy to
drown them in chain mail--

22:47.156 --> 22:49.992
I have been styling for
this magazine, missy,

22:50.008 --> 22:53.880
since before you bought your
first pair of orthopedic pumps.

22:54.118 --> 22:55.773
Well, maybe that's true,

22:55.786 --> 22:58.372
but for the record,
your "brilliant" cover of Courtney Love

22:58.386 --> 22:59.961
leaving rehab in a
wheelbarrow of pills

22:59.977 --> 23:02.572
was our lowest selling
issue in 17 years,

23:02.585 --> 23:05.310
so maybe you're not the
right person for the job.

23:06.408 --> 23:08.402
Are you firing me?

23:09.377 --> 23:11.393
I didn't say that,

23:11.416 --> 23:13.042
but if you don't
think you can do it--

23:13.057 --> 23:15.480
I don't, and clearly you don't,

23:15.498 --> 23:18.100
so I suggest that
you find someone

23:18.118 --> 23:20.963
who designs installations
for the Bronx zoo.

23:20.977 --> 23:24.021
Oh, tell them to bring treats.

23:29.266 --> 23:31.111
Who the hell is this woman?

23:31.128 --> 23:34.281
For today, she's the boss.

23:41.837 --> 23:43.510
Do you know where you're going?

23:44.805 --> 23:47.800
Do you know what
JFK stands for...

23:47.945 --> 23:49.592
Pradip?

23:49.607 --> 23:52.273
You said take side street.
This is side street.

23:52.285 --> 23:54.821
No, this is slow street.

23:55.475 --> 23:57.083
Pathetic.

23:57.185 --> 24:00.231
This city will hand
out licenses to anyone.

24:00.816 --> 24:03.243
"What'd you drive
in the old country, a goat?

24:03.296 --> 24:05.210
Here, have a cab."

24:06.768 --> 24:08.483
Why are we stopping?

24:08.495 --> 24:11.391
You getting out.
I do not have to drive nasty person.

24:11.408 --> 24:13.252
Fine. Leave him here.

24:13.266 --> 24:15.941
No, you, out. Go.

24:15.956 --> 24:19.492
Okay, okay,
maybe we should just...

24:28.076 --> 24:32.911
Okay, so...
let's regroup, call another cab

24:32.927 --> 24:36.781
and see if they'll
come to, um...

24:37.146 --> 24:39.480
Dante's seventh circle of hell.

24:39.557 --> 24:41.182
Uh, give me your phone.

24:41.398 --> 24:43.220
- Willie?
- I--oh.

24:43.238 --> 24:45.190
Where's your bag?

24:49.045 --> 24:51.341
Why isn't she
answering her phone?

24:52.675 --> 24:53.852
Betty.

24:54.257 --> 24:55.362
Betty.

24:56.068 --> 24:59.330
Betty, where the
hell is Daniel, hmm?

25:02.205 --> 25:05.390
You've been covering for your
boss all day, haven't you?

25:07.068 --> 25:08.873
Well, at least let me help you.

25:08.886 --> 25:11.882
No, Sofia, you cannot be more
involved than you already are.

25:11.898 --> 25:13.553
What are you talking about?

25:15.007 --> 25:16.863
Daniel's not here
because of you.

25:16.877 --> 25:18.212
- Me?
- Yes.

25:18.228 --> 25:19.722
You broke his heart last night,

25:19.738 --> 25:22.631
so he drank himself sick,
and now he's at my house,

25:22.648 --> 25:25.743
making little drummer boys
out of stale marshmallow.

25:25.855 --> 25:27.771
Did Daniel fire Bruno?

25:27.785 --> 25:29.381
We weren't on the same page.

25:29.398 --> 25:31.981
Well, Daniel better have a concept,
because team baby Chutney

25:31.998 --> 25:34.331
is waiting in the conference
room for direction.

25:36.085 --> 25:38.283
Tell 'em I'll be
there in ten minutes.

25:44.378 --> 25:46.453
I made the frame out
of chenille sticks.

25:46.465 --> 25:48.060
Cool. Where'd you find those?

25:48.075 --> 25:49.383
Fabric store.

25:49.397 --> 25:52.120
Yo, what do you say we go outside,
get some fresh air,

25:52.138 --> 25:53.613
toss a football?

25:53.626 --> 25:54.942
We're doing the tree.

25:54.956 --> 25:56.571
Yeah, well,
give the glitter a rest.

25:56.585 --> 25:57.680
Come on.

25:57.695 --> 25:59.892
Come out and be a
normal kid for an hour.

26:00.538 --> 26:02.112
I don't know, Santos,

26:02.126 --> 26:04.323
I mean,
if Justin deserts me now,

26:04.338 --> 26:07.271
the tree'll end up looking
like overdressed firewood.

26:07.287 --> 26:09.162
I need Justin's eyes.

26:09.597 --> 26:11.130
He's got a gift.

26:11.146 --> 26:13.812
Yeah? Well,
there's other things he can learn,

26:13.825 --> 26:15.561
things no one's teaching
him in this house.

26:15.576 --> 26:16.651
What's that supposed to mean?

26:16.686 --> 26:17.823
Just what I said.

26:17.836 --> 26:19.610
Who the hell's taking
him to fabric stores?

26:19.626 --> 26:21.102
I am.

26:21.116 --> 26:22.463
Come here.

26:23.088 --> 26:26.033
Who are you to come here after
all this time and judge anybody

26:26.045 --> 26:27.682
or anything in this family?

26:27.698 --> 26:30.071
You want me to just sit by and
watch him play with chenille

26:30.086 --> 26:31.262
and not say something about it?

26:31.298 --> 26:33.561
No, keeping talking. You're gonna
leave here with a few less teeth.

26:33.598 --> 26:35.621
Look, if his own family doesn't
put a stop to this, then I am--

26:35.658 --> 26:37.093
A stop to what?

26:37.105 --> 26:40.070
He is comfortable with who he is,
and so am I.

26:40.088 --> 26:43.561
If you got a problem with him,
or with us,

26:43.578 --> 26:45.270
then you don't belong here.

26:45.288 --> 26:47.472
So you call all the shots,
is that it?

26:48.767 --> 26:50.283
Okay, jefe.

26:50.708 --> 26:52.120
Adiós.

26:53.198 --> 26:54.752
Don't say I didn't try.

27:06.475 --> 27:09.412
You know, I think, uh,
I twisted this wrong.

27:09.426 --> 27:11.233
Was I supposed to braid it?

27:26.868 --> 27:30.411
Hi. This is Betty Suarez.
I'm calling from "Mode" magazine.

27:45.426 --> 27:47.663
Hold on just one second.
That's disgusting.

27:47.727 --> 27:50.680
Using Tim and Chloe's
first film as inspiration,

27:50.697 --> 27:53.993
we'll recreate a jungle setting
at the Rego Park arboretum.

27:54.237 --> 27:57.373
Ew. Does Daniel really
expect Tim and Chloe

27:57.388 --> 27:59.582
to get out of their
limo in Queens?

27:59.597 --> 28:01.731
Well, Amanda.
They'll be stepping into paradise,

28:01.747 --> 28:03.003
the garden of eden.

28:03.018 --> 28:05.510
Since the firstborn child
is all about beginnings,

28:05.525 --> 28:07.740
we'll portray the new
parents as the first family,

28:07.757 --> 28:10.122
a 21st century Adam and Eve.

28:10.505 --> 28:14.341
How do you not have any cash on you,
not even an A.T.M. card?

28:14.357 --> 28:16.631
There's $17 in my account.
We can go to the bank,

28:16.645 --> 28:18.602
but I swear,
it'll be a social call.

28:18.616 --> 28:20.882
Do taxis even come to
this part of the world?

28:20.898 --> 28:22.362
Where are we?

28:22.378 --> 28:24.462
I don't think we
want to ask them.

28:25.376 --> 28:28.821
Well, we have no choice.
Go ask them to borrow $20.

28:28.837 --> 28:32.091
Something tells me they're more
into receiving than giving.

28:32.105 --> 28:34.123
Never mind. I'll do it.

28:34.136 --> 28:36.650
Pardon me. Hello.

28:37.725 --> 28:42.093
Uh, my assistant and I are
in an absurd situation.

28:42.107 --> 28:44.550
The taxi that was taking
us to the airport--

28:44.567 --> 28:46.163
Ain't no airport around here.

28:46.178 --> 28:48.580
That's what I told the driver.

28:48.597 --> 28:50.690
I'm Wilhelmina Slater.

28:52.056 --> 28:54.073
"Mode" magazine.

28:55.215 --> 28:57.260
Perhaps you don't
subscribe. Anyway--

28:57.278 --> 28:59.980
What are you wearin',
girl? Rabbit?

28:59.996 --> 29:03.130
Uh, actually, it's, uh...
albino lynx,

29:03.147 --> 29:06.490
and it's not as warm
as it might seem.

29:06.506 --> 29:10.242
Ooh, girl, shoot. I could make me
some fierce pillows outta this puppy.

29:10.316 --> 29:12.352
Okay, back off, girlfriends.

29:12.368 --> 29:16.242
Stop pawin' my piece,
'less you gonna show me some benjies.

29:16.256 --> 29:18.512
You... know what I'm sayin'?

29:19.558 --> 29:22.033
- Benjies?
- Where you from?

29:22.045 --> 29:24.931
Okay, Lil' Kim.
Visiting hours are over.

29:24.945 --> 29:27.483
What, you gonna charge
me to touch you?

29:27.495 --> 29:28.723
She's new in the field, girls,

29:28.738 --> 29:31.103
and her corner's a long,
long way from here, so...

29:31.117 --> 29:33.393
- Oh, so you about to get cut--
- Uh, run.

29:33.407 --> 29:35.062
You better get up outta here.

29:37.717 --> 29:42.222
Where does this go?

29:42.235 --> 29:45.441
Near the top. That's where we
hang all of our stocking ones.

29:45.455 --> 29:46.970
We each have our own.

29:47.125 --> 29:48.900
This one'll be yours.

30:06.787 --> 30:08.982
Oh, gingerbread's done.

30:15.815 --> 30:18.131
Listen, Mr. Suarez, um...

30:18.567 --> 30:21.193
I'm sorry if I stepped
on anyone's toes.

30:21.205 --> 30:22.710
I really didn't mean to
get in between your--

30:22.747 --> 30:24.543
Please, Daniel.

30:25.075 --> 30:27.271
I'm thankful you were here.

30:28.837 --> 30:31.101
You'll make a great
father someday.

30:34.938 --> 30:37.410
Tim and Chloe in
the garden of eden?

30:37.558 --> 30:40.403
Oh, no, I-I like it, Betty.
It's clever, and--

30:40.415 --> 30:42.843
- And what?
- I don't know. It's just...

30:43.338 --> 30:47.702
I wonder if we'd be better
off with something... simpler.

30:47.718 --> 30:49.171
I mean, Tim and Chloe--

30:49.186 --> 30:52.412
they don't have to be seen
in some exotic jungle.

30:52.438 --> 30:54.950
All right,
they're two working-class kids

30:54.967 --> 30:57.243
who just grew up
to be movie stars.

30:57.256 --> 30:59.403
What if we saw them
in a living room,

30:59.638 --> 31:02.433
in a row house in
some neighborhood,

31:02.445 --> 31:06.782
just doing something
a family does?

31:08.697 --> 31:11.372
I think you should bring
Tim and Chloe here,

31:11.385 --> 31:13.233
to your house.

31:13.295 --> 31:15.363
I think he started
drinking again.

31:15.378 --> 31:17.260
I heard that, and I haven't.

31:17.278 --> 31:19.122
Get them to come here.

31:19.138 --> 31:20.981
I've got an idea.

31:26.868 --> 31:29.050
Come on, now.
Come on, come on, come on.

31:30.726 --> 31:33.343
Oh, Sofia, it's you.

31:33.355 --> 31:35.201
I'm so glad I caught you.
I called your assistant

31:35.235 --> 31:36.722
and she said that you were
leaving for the airport.

31:36.758 --> 31:38.882
I was hoping that you
could maybe drop me off?

31:38.897 --> 31:40.030
Drop you off where?

31:40.047 --> 31:42.181
Home. Daniel's come up with
this whole new concept.

31:42.197 --> 31:43.843
We're gonna shoot baby
Chutney in my living room,

31:43.878 --> 31:46.331
sort of an old-fashioned Christmas
portrait around our tree.

31:46.345 --> 31:49.853
That Daniel has so many ideas,
doesn't he?

31:49.866 --> 31:52.393
No. I'm serious.
This is his idea.

31:52.555 --> 31:55.282
I need a ride,
and it's on your way.

31:57.408 --> 32:00.901
How the hell did I wind up in
a run-down storefront church

32:00.918 --> 32:02.990
in the middle of Queens?

32:04.606 --> 32:07.720
Are we sure there's not
a phone in this place?

32:07.735 --> 32:09.370
Maybe under the altar?

32:09.385 --> 32:11.543
It doesn't matter, anyway.
It's too late.

32:11.758 --> 32:13.803
I really screwed up this time.

32:13.816 --> 32:15.392
Oh, please.

32:15.406 --> 32:18.760
Everyone knows traffic's insane
on Thanksgiving weekend,

32:18.777 --> 32:21.762
and besides,
I'm sure Bruno's handling it.

32:21.775 --> 32:23.701
You hire the best.

32:23.715 --> 32:25.281
I can't even do my job anymore.

32:25.295 --> 32:27.852
I'm too busy trying
to cover Daniel's.

32:27.866 --> 32:29.342
I'm so distracted,

32:29.356 --> 32:33.530
spending every minute trying to
take over the whole company.

32:33.548 --> 32:35.683
You're trying to take
over the whole company?

32:36.656 --> 32:38.572
I didn't say that.

32:39.395 --> 32:41.321
I would never say that.

32:42.207 --> 32:45.973
What I'm saying is,
I'm--I'm not the leader I used to be.

32:45.987 --> 32:49.081
Willie, don't be so
hard on yourself.

32:49.096 --> 32:50.872
You know what they say--

32:50.886 --> 32:54.930
it has to get really dark
before it can get light again.

32:59.028 --> 33:01.030
Marc, you are right.

33:01.046 --> 33:02.592
Amen.

33:15.617 --> 33:18.303
There's enough in here to
get us back to civilization.

33:19.465 --> 33:21.373
Is it all singles?

33:21.727 --> 33:24.742
Poor people are so cheap.

33:39.256 --> 33:40.550
Let's go.

33:46.735 --> 33:49.210
Oh, yeah,
this is Betty's house.

33:49.675 --> 33:51.082
Oh, really...?

33:52.605 --> 33:54.943
You couldn't get a
ride with Christina?

33:54.955 --> 33:56.831
Okay, look, I lied.

33:57.467 --> 33:59.902
Sofia, I don't want to
have to tell Daniel

33:59.916 --> 34:03.681
that you might be coming back on
monday as someone else's wife.

34:03.788 --> 34:06.261
You need to tell
him that yourself.

34:19.844 --> 34:20.943
What's the matter?

34:20.958 --> 34:22.512
That was perfume.

34:26.726 --> 34:29.322
I think we should put this
one on the back side.

34:29.335 --> 34:32.012
Unh-unh. Touch that
and I break your arm.

34:39.417 --> 34:40.733
Is that her?

34:41.088 --> 34:42.210
Yeah.

34:43.395 --> 34:45.172
Now I get it.

34:46.545 --> 34:48.061
Uh, Mr. Suarez?

34:49.385 --> 34:51.193
Uh, how do you say,

34:51.205 --> 34:55.851
"I love you, and I can't live
without you" in spanish?

34:55.864 --> 34:57.811
- Te amo...
- Te amo...

34:57.827 --> 35:00.073
y no puedo vivir sin ti...

35:00.198 --> 35:03.770
y no puedo vivir sin ti.

35:05.996 --> 35:07.321
Good luck.

35:07.457 --> 35:08.903
That's english.

35:12.025 --> 35:13.470
Wow,

35:14.195 --> 35:16.891
no wonder he wanted
to bring them here.

35:17.006 --> 35:20.291
It looks like Daniel had the
winning idea after all, huh?

35:20.305 --> 35:22.680
You had a few good
ones yourself.

35:22.705 --> 35:25.162
Not that we're really
using any of them.

35:27.678 --> 35:29.073
Betty...

35:29.177 --> 35:32.600
you're wasting your time
at "Mode" magazine.

35:33.197 --> 35:34.442
What?

35:35.247 --> 35:37.082
Why would you say that?

35:37.707 --> 35:40.932
Because you think with your heart,
not just with your head.

35:40.946 --> 35:43.992
It took a lot to stand
up to Bruno Jacobs,

35:44.005 --> 35:47.962
and the people at "Mode" are
never going to appreciate that.

35:48.358 --> 35:50.562
Come work for my magazine.

35:50.596 --> 35:53.272
You'll have your own
assistant within a year.

35:53.286 --> 35:55.380
Oh, I-I'm not so
sure about that.

35:55.396 --> 35:58.291
I know it's a little
awkward because of Daniel.

35:58.307 --> 36:00.643
But please, just consider it.

36:00.656 --> 36:02.720
Are you really
offering me a job?

36:02.735 --> 36:05.023
One with a real future.

36:16.107 --> 36:18.041
Oh, hey. Where are we?

36:18.058 --> 36:19.450
Uh, just about to start.

36:19.467 --> 36:21.191
You may want to
supervise your nephew.

36:21.207 --> 36:23.591
He keeps trying different
hats on the baby.

36:23.895 --> 36:26.631
Is... Sofia coming in?

36:26.645 --> 36:28.802
She's on her way to the
airport to meet Hunter.

36:28.816 --> 36:30.550
You might want to
go talk to her

36:30.567 --> 36:32.312
while you still can.

36:36.638 --> 36:37.790
Justin!

36:40.768 --> 36:43.300
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:45.168 --> 36:47.200
I've thought about
what you said

36:47.546 --> 36:49.040
outside the club.

36:50.947 --> 36:55.230
Sofia, I come from a
pretty messed up family.

36:55.246 --> 36:57.142
I don't exactly have a
great frame of reference

36:57.156 --> 36:59.510
when I hear the words
"happily married."

36:59.527 --> 37:03.300
That being said,
not every family is my family...

37:03.415 --> 37:05.143
thank god.

37:06.588 --> 37:09.163
Before you rush off
with someone else,

37:10.306 --> 37:12.932
I'd like to at least
have one more chance.

37:18.887 --> 37:23.511
Te amo y no puedo
vivitar sin ti.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.871
You don't believe me?

37:27.885 --> 37:32.611
No, you just said you
loved your camera.

37:40.455 --> 37:42.632
Is this for me?

37:42.975 --> 37:45.023
It's supposed to be a dove.

37:45.286 --> 37:48.410
I haven't quite mastered
the art of the jelly bean.

37:49.768 --> 37:54.800
Maybe later tonight we could
pick out a tree to hang it on...

37:58.768 --> 38:00.911
if that'd be okay.

38:20.056 --> 38:22.123
We're gonna need the
replacement card today.

38:22.137 --> 38:23.690
Put on your supervisor.

38:24.796 --> 38:26.721
Wilhelmina Slater's office.

38:26.735 --> 38:30.222
Whose idea was it to move a
celebrity shoot to Queens?!

38:30.238 --> 38:32.393
Do I still have a job?
I hear screaming.

38:32.406 --> 38:33.762
You're off the hook,

38:33.776 --> 38:36.953
but it's gonna cost you a lot--
at Barney's.

38:37.785 --> 38:40.100
Amanda, leave the roof.

38:40.858 --> 38:42.782
All right, so are you sure
you don't want me to stay

38:42.815 --> 38:44.111
and help finish cleaning up?

38:44.127 --> 38:47.660
No. Justin won't let you near
anything Chloe touched anyway.

38:48.185 --> 38:51.853
Well, thanks for
everything you did today.

38:51.865 --> 38:53.601
You're the one
who saved the day.

38:53.616 --> 38:56.892
Yeah, but you're the one
who brought Sofia here.

38:56.908 --> 38:58.220
Well, yes.

38:58.237 --> 39:01.263
I just thought she needed to see
you in a different part of town.

39:01.277 --> 39:02.693
Did she catch her plane?

39:02.707 --> 39:05.393
She decided to
postpone her trip.

39:05.658 --> 39:08.400
Oh, congratulations.

39:08.418 --> 39:09.813
Same to you.

39:09.825 --> 39:12.460
She told me about the job
offer she made to you.

39:12.475 --> 39:15.491
Oh, no, Daniel.
I--it came out of nowhere.

39:15.507 --> 39:17.931
I didn't even take her seriously.
I would never--I mean--

39:17.948 --> 39:20.010
I could never... leave you.

39:20.026 --> 39:22.530
It's a fantastic opportunity.

39:22.748 --> 39:24.693
- I'm happy--
- Betty...

39:24.886 --> 39:27.622
you didn't grow up wanting
to be my assistant.

39:27.918 --> 39:30.082
You have your own dreams.

39:30.807 --> 39:33.221
I would never
stand in your way.

39:43.206 --> 39:45.072
Wilhelmina Slater's office.

39:45.086 --> 39:47.032
Is she there?

39:47.278 --> 39:49.143
Who may I say is calling?

39:49.157 --> 39:52.363
An old friend from college.

39:57.557 --> 40:00.970
Line two,
an old friend from college...

40:00.988 --> 40:03.410
which you never went to.

40:05.397 --> 40:07.012
It's Wilhelmina.

40:07.028 --> 40:11.991
Why is someone named Pradip
answering your cell phone?

40:12.315 --> 40:15.052
Marc, can I have some
privacy, please?

40:15.065 --> 40:16.751
Come on, Willie.

40:16.768 --> 40:19.483
We don't have any secrets,
not anymore.

40:19.527 --> 40:21.573
We're in this together, right?

40:21.587 --> 40:23.633
I'll call you right back.

40:27.658 --> 40:29.553
What do you want, Marc?

40:30.057 --> 40:33.110
Job security, a title...

40:33.557 --> 40:37.053
and my own company credit
card would be nice.

40:37.066 --> 40:39.721
Wow, he was such a nice guy.

40:39.737 --> 40:41.030
He's not at all
what I expected.

40:41.047 --> 40:42.730
Well, he was a
little hung over.

40:42.748 --> 40:45.383
Mija, I'm not
talking about Daniel.

40:45.395 --> 40:47.201
I'm talking about Tim.

40:47.218 --> 40:49.023
There was a movie star
in my house today.

40:49.035 --> 40:49.740
There were two!

40:49.756 --> 40:51.520
So when do we see the pictures?

40:51.616 --> 40:54.503
I guess when they
hit the newsstands.

40:54.515 --> 40:56.422
I might be able to sneak
home a copy, though,

40:56.437 --> 40:57.811
if I'm still working there.

40:57.828 --> 40:59.521
Wait a minute--
what do you mean, "if"?

40:59.538 --> 41:00.892
Well, I could be
working at "Mode,"

41:00.925 --> 41:04.052
or I could be working
at another magazine.

41:04.068 --> 41:05.650
Another magazine?

41:05.668 --> 41:07.570
You mean there's two
magazines that want you?

41:07.588 --> 41:09.232
Yeah. Can you believe that?

41:09.246 --> 41:10.981
When did this happen?

41:11.928 --> 41:14.352
I'll get it. But, Betty...

41:14.367 --> 41:16.413
no news till I get back.

41:16.788 --> 41:20.190
- Dad-- Just tell us something.
- Betty, come on, just tell us.

41:20.446 --> 41:21.750
Wait.

41:31.218 --> 41:32.432
Can I help you?

41:32.445 --> 41:33.960
Ignacio Suarez?

41:33.978 --> 41:35.242
That's me.

41:35.255 --> 41:37.801
We're with immigration
and customs enforcement.

41:37.815 --> 41:39.120
What can I do for you?

41:39.138 --> 41:40.922
You're gonna have to
come with us, sir.

41:40.936 --> 41:42.173
Why?

41:42.188 --> 41:44.061
Mr. Suarez,
you're under arrest.
