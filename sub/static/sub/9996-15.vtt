Previously on Medium:

00:03.370 --> 00:06.350
Name's Autumn Colville. Mother
reported her missing yesterday.

00:09.150 --> 00:12.400
The blood. And that corpse.

00:12.670 --> 00:14.550
What corpse?

00:16.160 --> 00:18.940
Scanlon just called. They found
the remains of Autumn Colville.

00:18.950 --> 00:20.500
There were several more
duffel bags down there.

00:20.520 --> 00:24.120
When they opened them up,they found the
butchered body parts of two more girls.

00:24.140 --> 00:26.370
Looks like we got
ourselves a serial killer.

00:26.400 --> 00:29.020
I got a call from Ashley's father today.

00:29.330 --> 00:32.800
He's convinced that his daughter is
sharing her antianxiety medication with you.

00:32.820 --> 00:36.750
There's this girl,and she won't leave me alone
and she won't let me study or concentrate...

00:36.780 --> 00:38.510
Wait a second. Hold on. What girl?

00:38.520 --> 00:40.690
Stacey Anne Burrows.

00:40.710 --> 00:44.310
Stacey Anne--
is she dead?

00:45.630 --> 00:51.340
We decided that if the doctor thinks that this
medicine will improve the quality of your life,

00:51.350 --> 00:54.640
I will try to get that
appointment as soon as possible.

00:54.650 --> 00:56.820
Allison Dubois? I'm Caitlyn Lynch.

00:56.830 --> 00:58.670
I'm with the Lydecker Corporation.

00:58.700 --> 01:00.190
You're offering me a job?

01:00.240 --> 01:03.010
What exactly does it mean when
they say "high six figures"?

01:03.040 --> 01:04.680
Means you need to call her tomorrow.

01:04.709 --> 01:06.380
You need to find out
what this is all about.

01:06.410 --> 01:07.850
So you think I should take it?

01:07.890 --> 01:09.380
How do you not take it?

01:09.420 --> 01:12.680
These are employee dossiers.

01:12.690 --> 01:14.870
I'd like you to spend
some time with them.

01:14.880 --> 01:18.600
See if there's anyone among
this group that gives you pause.

01:18.620 --> 01:21.030
Well,he's really the only
person who jumped out at me.

01:21.070 --> 01:23.480
And this is the only employee
that you're worried about?

01:23.510 --> 01:27.200
He's Justin Lydecker.
Mr. Lydecker's son.

01:27.210 --> 01:31.670
Your father is interested in
my impressions of things,people,

01:31.710 --> 01:34.380
which is why I think he
wanted me to sit down with you.

01:34.390 --> 01:35.990
Yeah. That's what I figured.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.480
He wants you to tell him if his only son
is permanently screwed up or if I can be...

01:40.490 --> 01:41.850
salvaged.

01:41.870 --> 01:43.840
Lee,it's me. I just had another dream.

01:43.850 --> 01:46.280
I think it happened
again,another murder.

01:46.310 --> 01:50.130
The dreams you've been having about the murders,did
you mention your dreams to your colleague?

01:50.160 --> 01:52.650
Dreams that we're talking about
have nothing to do with Lydecker.

01:52.690 --> 01:56.900
Your dreams,your impressions,they
belong to Lydecker now.

01:56.940 --> 02:00.040
They are actually the intellectual
property of our company.

02:00.080 --> 02:02.910
If you ever breach your contract again,

02:02.950 --> 02:08.789
I will litigate you with a vigor unlike
anything you have ever experienced in your life.

02:15.670 --> 02:16.590
Justin.

03:02.770 --> 03:04.760
Justin.

03:05.030 --> 03:06.480
He knows.

03:06.510 --> 03:10.430
Hold on a second,wait. I'm not
following. Who-who is this "he"?

03:10.440 --> 03:12.370
What is it you're saying that he knows?

03:12.380 --> 03:14.950
And while we're at
it,where are you going?

03:14.960 --> 03:18.250
I think I need to get dressed.
I need to go tell somebody.

03:18.260 --> 03:20.420
But,Allison...

03:20.430 --> 03:23.990
it's not even 6:00 in
the morning. Tell me.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.380
That maniac who's killing all those
women,gouging their eyes out,it's Justin Lydecker.

03:30.010 --> 03:32.010
Justin Lydecker?

03:32.020 --> 03:36.540
Douglas Lydecker's son,my boss's
son,his only son,his only child.

03:37.230 --> 03:39.360
And I think he knew,or
at least he suspected.

03:39.380 --> 03:40.790
I think that's why he hired me.

03:40.830 --> 03:42.750
To do what? To get confirmation?

03:42.760 --> 03:46.720
That,and the special added bonus
that if I ever dreamt the awful truth,

03:46.750 --> 03:48.770
I couldn't do anything
with those dreams because...

03:48.800 --> 03:52.850
He owns them. Your dreams are
his. That's-that's very smart.

03:53.510 --> 03:56.300
Guess that's how you get
to be Douglas Lydecker.

03:56.630 --> 03:57.920
So what are you gonna do?

03:57.940 --> 04:00.320
I have to tell the district attorney.

04:01.030 --> 04:03.410
Maybe if I hurry up,I can get
there before Devalos arrives.

04:03.440 --> 04:06.170
Nobody will see me.
No one will ever know.

04:18.089 --> 04:20.230
Allison.

04:26.360 --> 04:28.050
Caitlyn.

04:29.180 --> 04:32.430
I had a very interesting
dream about you last night.

04:32.700 --> 04:36.810
You were having a conversation with your
husband about things you saw in your sleep.

04:36.840 --> 04:41.370
And then you made a decision to come here
and share what you saw with your old boss.

04:41.400 --> 04:44.040
Well,then you know
everything there is to know.

04:44.050 --> 04:48.330
Why don't you come in with me,and we can
talk to the district attorney together.

04:48.340 --> 04:50.200
Allison,I'm not going in there.

04:50.230 --> 04:52.750
And you're not going in there.
It's simply not going to happen.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.200
I beg to differ.

04:54.920 --> 04:58.460
Allison,if you go in that building and
have the conversation you intend to,

04:58.500 --> 05:01.610
you'll be forcing Mr.
Lydecker to take legal action.

05:01.640 --> 05:03.670
I'm trying to help you.

05:03.690 --> 05:05.700
This is difficult for me,too.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.620
Well,let me make it easier. Here,I quit.

05:07.630 --> 05:09.210
It doesn't work that way.

05:09.230 --> 05:11.420
Go back and read your contract.

05:11.440 --> 05:15.020
Quitting doesn't release you from the
terms of our agreement. Far from it.

05:15.030 --> 05:20.550
If you breach your contract in any way
at any time,Lydecker can and will sue you.

05:20.780 --> 05:23.040
They will go after all of your assets.

05:23.060 --> 05:27.610
And when those are depleted,they'll go after any
collective assets you may have with your husband.

05:27.980 --> 05:30.590
I'm talking about your home,Allison.

05:31.080 --> 05:35.210
I'm talking about your husband's stake
in his venture with Cavanaugh Industries.

05:35.220 --> 05:39.100
I'm talking about any college fund
you may have started for your girls.

05:39.130 --> 05:41.570
Allison,Lydecker has an army of lawyers.

05:41.580 --> 05:46.000
And I promise you,there is nothing you
own that they won't find and take away.

05:48.140 --> 05:51.140
Women are dying horrible deaths.

05:51.150 --> 05:52.880
I'm aware of that.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.300
Mr. Lydecker is aware of that.

05:55.330 --> 05:59.390
We all want it to stop. It's
just,it cannot stop this way.

06:00.390 --> 06:04.090
Allison,before you play fast and
loose with your family's future,

06:04.100 --> 06:06.640
please,Mr. Lydecker wants to see you.

06:06.660 --> 06:08.420
He wants to discuss this with you.

06:08.450 --> 06:10.010
There's nothing to discuss.

06:10.020 --> 06:12.170
Just hear him out.

06:12.210 --> 06:15.350
Douglas is devastated about this.

06:15.370 --> 06:17.880
I promise you,he is not an evil man.

06:17.900 --> 06:21.260
And he has a plan on how to handle this.

06:25.650 --> 06:28.360
Are you trying to tell me something?

06:31.840 --> 06:37.210
The thing is,if it's something
important,I want to hear you.

06:37.880 --> 06:41.710
I want to help. But if it isn't...

06:43.550 --> 06:49.000
I'm going to the doctor's tomorrow,and
I'm gonna try and get him to give me pills.

06:50.710 --> 06:55.320
And then I won't be able to hear
you. It will be too late. So...

06:56.230 --> 06:58.770
if you have something to tell me...

06:58.780 --> 07:00.470
Ariel.

07:00.770 --> 07:02.770
Ariel.

07:03.020 --> 07:06.970
Ariel,wake up. Young lady,wake up.

07:08.080 --> 07:12.290
That's better. We don't show these
videos for you to sleep through.

07:20.220 --> 07:25.150
That girl,Karina Tyler,the first victim,

07:25.510 --> 07:28.450
she worked here,you know.

07:28.460 --> 07:31.310
A summer intern. Justin...

07:32.060 --> 07:34.040
oh,he couldn't stop looking at her.

07:34.080 --> 07:37.060
And when she came to
talk to me about his...

07:37.690 --> 07:40.430
disturbing behavior...

07:40.760 --> 07:45.400
I did what I'd always done. I
- I paid her to go away,quickly,quietly.

07:45.410 --> 07:49.260
It worked with the girls he frightened
in high school,the girls he...

07:49.610 --> 07:53.530
forced himself on in college.
It seemed to work with her.

07:56.170 --> 08:00.380
But then... months later...

08:02.380 --> 08:08.180
when I read that she had
gone missing,I couldn't...

08:08.810 --> 08:11.140
I couldn't help but wonder.

08:11.160 --> 08:13.740
But we weren't sure.

08:13.750 --> 08:15.770
That's when I told
Mr. Lydecker about you.

08:15.800 --> 08:19.030
I'd been reading about
you,hearing about you.

08:19.430 --> 08:24.790
I told Mr. Lydecker that if Karina
wasn't just missing,if she were dead,

08:25.590 --> 08:29.060
that she might try to
reach out through you.

08:32.070 --> 08:34.570
Well,you're right.

08:36.630 --> 08:39.690
There's something terribly
wrong with your son.

08:39.700 --> 08:42.429
And it's up to us to stop him.

08:42.460 --> 08:43.580
We have to go to the district attorney,

08:43.590 --> 08:47.200
- tell him what we know.
- No,no. No.

08:47.210 --> 08:50.260
It's been handled. It's being handled.

08:50.270 --> 08:53.490
No,I'm sorry,Mr. Lydecker,it's
not being handled.

08:53.510 --> 08:55.850
It can't be handled.

08:55.890 --> 08:59.190
Your son lives to kill,and
he will kill again.

08:59.220 --> 09:04.110
And now that there's no Detective Auerbach
cleaning up after him,he will be caught.

09:05.540 --> 09:06.790
You're aware of that,right?

09:06.830 --> 09:10.080
He was paying a detective
to cover his tracks.

09:10.090 --> 09:12.770
Detective Auerbach...

09:12.780 --> 09:15.490
used to work for me.

09:15.520 --> 09:20.030
He provided security for
company parties,for events.

09:20.040 --> 09:23.860
And after Justin started getting
into scuffles in nightclubs,

09:23.900 --> 09:29.040
I asked him to moonlight as Justin's
bodyguard,keep him out of trouble.

09:30.490 --> 09:33.360
Are you a fan of irony,Mrs. Dubois?

09:33.380 --> 09:37.310
Mr. Lydecker,I appreciate your pain.

09:37.320 --> 09:40.570
But there's really only one thing to do.

09:40.590 --> 09:43.100
Justin has to surrender
to the district attorney.

09:43.160 --> 09:46.210
I know the district attorney.

09:46.570 --> 09:48.830
I will go down there with your son.

09:48.870 --> 09:52.540
I will make sure that
he is treated fairly.

09:53.430 --> 09:57.750
Well,that is a very generous offer.

09:57.770 --> 10:02.010
And it's one that I would
give serious consideration to

10:02.020 --> 10:04.810
if my son were still in this country.

10:04.840 --> 10:06.430
What are you talking about?

10:06.460 --> 10:09.020
Justin is in a safe place.

10:09.310 --> 10:12.540
He's in the care of a
physician that I trust.

10:12.910 --> 10:16.290
He's begun a course of therapy
to treat Justin's condition.

10:16.330 --> 10:18.330
Therapy? There is no therapy.

10:18.340 --> 10:21.440
Are you aware of chemical castration?

10:22.200 --> 10:27.890
It's proven very effective in the
treatment of child molesters,serial rapists.

10:28.610 --> 10:30.900
His doctor is highly optimistic.

10:30.930 --> 10:32.400
What about his victims?

10:32.440 --> 10:35.480
There are four dead women
he has to account for.

10:35.490 --> 10:37.930
The families of those
women deserve justice.

10:37.970 --> 10:40.220
Yes. And they'll get it.

10:40.580 --> 10:42.640
A kind of justice,anyway.

10:42.650 --> 10:45.620
I've begun making anonymous
donations to their families,

10:45.630 --> 10:48.160
and they'll be extremely
well compensated.

10:48.210 --> 10:51.220
Mrs. Dubois,believe me
when I tell you this.

10:51.300 --> 10:56.620
The souls of these women will
always weigh heavily on me.

11:07.150 --> 11:08.840
Allison?

11:08.850 --> 11:11.610
Please don't do anything foolish.

11:12.760 --> 11:15.870
Like your dreams,keep this
conversation to yourself.

11:16.640 --> 11:20.610
Just don't give me a reason
to behave in ways that

11:21.230 --> 11:24.710
will make both of us very unhappy.

11:35.270 --> 11:36.980
Well?

11:36.990 --> 11:39.920
I don't know. I'm not a lawyer.

11:40.420 --> 11:43.620
But this contract looks
pretty ironclad to me.

11:43.630 --> 11:47.140
I think that the only thing
to do is to hire an attorney.

11:47.150 --> 11:49.300
Even then I'm not
holding out a lot of hope.

11:49.330 --> 11:52.380
I don't understand. How can
they control who I talk to?

11:52.390 --> 11:54.480
I mean,as long as it's
not a competitor...

11:54.520 --> 11:55.800
No,Allison...

11:55.820 --> 11:59.890
Well,the way that I read that thing,I'm not even
supposed to be having this conversation with you.

11:59.920 --> 12:03.890
Okay,be that as it may,if Junior really is
under a doctor's care in some foreign country,

12:03.920 --> 12:05.370
then the immediate danger is gone.

12:05.410 --> 12:08.520
There's really not all that
much to talk to Devalos about.

12:09.260 --> 12:11.970
And as for getting you out of
there,getting you out of your contract,

12:11.980 --> 12:17.710
I mean,I think that the only thing to do is to
start looking for an attorney in the morning.

12:19.870 --> 12:21.800
I'm psychic.

12:21.820 --> 12:24.040
Why didn't I see this coming?

12:24.060 --> 12:26.040
- How could I have been so stupid?
- Don't do that.

12:26.050 --> 12:28.720
You took the job for
all the right reasons.

12:29.380 --> 12:32.260
And don't forget,you had a
lot of help. I encouraged you.

12:32.270 --> 12:34.760
I pushed you to take it.

12:36.020 --> 12:38.180
Come on. Let's just get some rest.

12:38.190 --> 12:40.380
For one thing,we got Ariel's
doctors appointment in the morning.

12:40.420 --> 12:42.920
For another,maybe it
will give us some clarity.

12:42.960 --> 12:46.100
Maybe things will look a
lot better in the morning.

12:46.140 --> 12:49.140
I'm not nearly as convinced
of that as you are.

13:02.660 --> 13:04.560
How you feeling?

13:05.410 --> 13:09.980
Like somebody drugged me and
flew me to a foreign country

13:09.990 --> 13:13.040
and locked me in my room without TV.

13:13.670 --> 13:15.990
Well,I am trying to save your life.

13:16.020 --> 13:18.450
You're trying to save your business.

13:18.480 --> 13:21.860
Daddy,you're trying to
save your reputation.

13:23.880 --> 13:27.750
It's not good for the stock prices
if people read that the CEO's son

13:27.790 --> 13:33.680
likes to julienne pretty young girls
and take their eyes as souvenirs.

13:34.610 --> 13:38.590
Probably would have made for a
contentious stockholders' meeting as well.

13:38.620 --> 13:41.200
Justin,do you not understand?

13:41.540 --> 13:43.800
They are hours away from arresting you.

13:43.830 --> 13:46.620
You have any idea what prison
would be like for someone like you?

13:47.500 --> 13:49.970
Okay. All right. You just...

13:49.980 --> 13:54.080
you just keep clinging to your pose and I'll
keep willing you into accepting the second chance

13:54.130 --> 13:57.860
that I am giving you,whether
you want it or not.

13:58.600 --> 14:01.950
- You pathetic slug.
- You're such an ass.

14:09.870 --> 14:13.270
Please. Please. I can't
breathe. I can't...

14:15.460 --> 14:18.170
What? He wants to live?

14:18.770 --> 14:20.930
How human of him.

14:29.560 --> 14:31.990
You understand about these treatments?

14:32.610 --> 14:35.610
********

14:43.870 --> 14:46.860
Now. In front of me.

15:37.440 --> 15:39.860
The nurse says we're next.

15:45.120 --> 15:48.070
- Do you hear me?
- What?

15:48.810 --> 15:51.180
We're next.

15:53.250 --> 15:56.880
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

15:57.270 --> 15:59.030
Just something with my new job.

15:59.050 --> 16:01.750
Something I have to tell my-my boss.

16:01.790 --> 16:03.660
Or my boss's boss.

16:03.700 --> 16:07.220
I tried to call,but couldn't get
a hold of anyone this morning.

16:09.410 --> 16:13.120
I'm okay here if you want to
step outside and use your cell.

16:14.180 --> 16:18.590
No. No,I'm fine.

16:19.310 --> 16:21.590
I'm fine.

16:22.730 --> 16:25.220
You want to just go?

16:25.700 --> 16:27.500
What do you mean? Leave?

16:28.410 --> 16:30.240
Honey,what are you talking about?

16:30.260 --> 16:33.090
You waited a long time
for this appointment.

16:33.110 --> 16:35.810
What about your test and your studying?

16:37.610 --> 16:41.260
Ariel,it's going to be all right.

16:41.270 --> 16:43.670
This doctor knows me.

16:43.680 --> 16:46.170
I think he's going to understand.

16:46.180 --> 16:47.960
Ariel Dubois?

16:54.880 --> 16:57.970
Diane? Are you out there?

16:59.300 --> 17:01.910
Why is someone knocking on my door?

17:05.980 --> 17:08.550
Whoever you are,go away.

17:08.560 --> 17:11.160
This is my serenity time.

17:13.630 --> 17:16.300
I've been trying to get to you all day.

17:19.349 --> 17:23.670
Sorry. I've been in
meetings. On conference calls.

17:23.680 --> 17:25.970
Mr. Lydecker's out of the country,so...

17:25.980 --> 17:28.970
Justin isn't taking his medication.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.090
And you know this because...

17:30.110 --> 17:31.950
Because I dreamt it last night.

17:31.970 --> 17:34.590
He's pretending. He really
doesn't want to get better.

17:35.210 --> 17:37.500
That's not possible.
His father is with him.

17:37.510 --> 17:39.460
He's supervising the treatment himself.

17:39.470 --> 17:40.880
He's putting on an act.

17:40.900 --> 17:45.490
As soon as Mr. Lydecker leaves the room,Justin
throws his medication in the toilet.

17:49.590 --> 17:51.750
Can you get me Mr. Lydecker,please?

17:51.790 --> 17:54.050
You know where he is,right?

17:54.640 --> 17:57.580
Tell him it's urgent.

18:05.130 --> 18:07.800
- Allison?
- Yeah,I'm afraid so.

18:09.100 --> 18:10.650
How do you do that?

18:10.690 --> 18:14.190
How do you know the exact moment when
everything from spaghetti night is all cleaned up

18:14.210 --> 18:16.610
and it's safe to come home,huh?

18:16.620 --> 18:19.920
Very not funny. Bridgette
and Marie asleep?

18:20.350 --> 18:23.720
Yes. Just barely. You
ever get to Lydecker?

18:23.730 --> 18:25.440
No. We just kept calling and calling.

18:25.450 --> 18:27.250
Finally,Caitlyn told
me just to come home.

18:27.270 --> 18:29.660
That she'd keep trying till she got him.

18:30.790 --> 18:33.600
I just wish I knew where
they were stashing Justin.

18:33.640 --> 18:37.650
I swear to God,I would pick up the
phone and tell Devalos everything I know.

18:37.670 --> 18:42.120
See if maybe he could make some kind of arrangement
with the authorities and bring him back here.

18:42.130 --> 18:45.710
Hey,did you happen to pick
up that medication for Ariel?

18:45.750 --> 18:49.550
Yes,indeed. All $97 worth of it.

18:49.910 --> 18:52.520
Now the challenge is going
to be getting her to take it.

18:53.340 --> 18:55.670
What are you talking about?

18:55.960 --> 18:58.420
So,what's changed?

18:58.440 --> 19:02.040
A week ago,all you could think
about was getting those pills.

19:02.590 --> 19:04.510
I know.

19:04.540 --> 19:07.310
You and Dad must think I'm crazy.

19:09.230 --> 19:14.020
There's this substitute teacher
at my school,Miss Snowden.

19:15.520 --> 19:19.240
And when I see her sometimes,it's
like someone's hurt her.

19:20.910 --> 19:24.100
She's all bloody and cut up and...

19:25.590 --> 19:28.270
She's not really.

19:28.290 --> 19:31.230
Not yet,but it's like she's going to be.

19:31.240 --> 19:35.670
So,is there's something we should
do? Someone I should talk to?

19:36.150 --> 19:38.890
I'm afraid that if I take these pills,

19:38.900 --> 19:42.140
Stacey Anne won't be able to
show me what I need to know.

19:42.810 --> 19:45.890
You know that the PSATs
are the day after tomorrow?

19:45.910 --> 19:48.050
I know.

19:48.290 --> 19:53.140
And I know that these pills will
make everything I'm seeing go away.

19:54.190 --> 19:57.400
And I'll be able to concentrate.

20:00.760 --> 20:03.720
But if something happens
to Miss Snowden...

20:04.160 --> 20:07.320
something that I could have prevented...

20:09.740 --> 20:15.920
So,you think you could hang
onto these for a while for me?

20:18.580 --> 20:21.180
Sure,honey.

20:34.180 --> 20:36.790
What kind of a fool do you take me for?

20:37.480 --> 20:39.980
It's time you take your medicine.

20:43.210 --> 20:45.570
All right,that's right,that's all right.

20:45.630 --> 20:47.630
You just go ahead,you
scream all you want!

20:47.640 --> 20:50.450
You just scream all you
want. I sent the guards away.

20:50.460 --> 20:52.400
It's just you and me.

20:52.410 --> 20:56.660
I'm going nowhere until these
pills are in your gullet!

20:56.670 --> 20:59.220
Okay,come on.

20:59.670 --> 21:03.820
Open up! Swallow!
Swallow,swallow,here we go.

21:03.830 --> 21:06.890
Open up,open,open.

21:10.990 --> 21:15.050
Swallow! Swallow.
Swallow. Swallow,swallow!

21:28.360 --> 21:30.380
Isn't this fantastic?

21:30.390 --> 21:33.070
Go ahead. Pick an artery,Pop.

21:33.080 --> 21:35.450
Which one you want me to start with?

21:35.920 --> 21:37.800
How about the carotid?

21:37.830 --> 21:40.250
That's always a winner for me.

21:49.670 --> 21:52.790
- Hello?
- Allison? It's Caitlyn.

21:52.800 --> 21:55.640
Caitlyn,I've been trying
to reach you all night.

21:55.650 --> 22:00.500
I know. I've been on a plane. I
just landed. I got your messages.

22:01.220 --> 22:03.320
Allison,do you have a passport?

22:04.050 --> 22:06.840
What? Yeah. W
- Wait a second.

22:06.850 --> 22:08.800
There's something I need to tell you.

22:08.830 --> 22:11.870
I had another dream about
Justin and his father.

22:11.900 --> 22:15.650
Please,Allison. I think
I already know. I just...

22:15.660 --> 22:18.280
I'm sending a car to your house.

22:18.300 --> 22:20.450
It'll bring you to the Phoenix airport.

22:20.480 --> 22:23.010
The Lydecker hangar. There
will be a plane waiting.

22:23.020 --> 22:25.040
It'll bring you here to me.

22:25.070 --> 22:26.850
So we can talk.

22:26.890 --> 22:28.650
W
- Where am I going?

22:28.670 --> 22:30.710
I'd really rather not say.

22:30.730 --> 22:33.770
Wait,Caitlyn,no. I
- I'm a mother.

22:34.180 --> 22:36.160
I
- I have three children,a husband.

22:36.190 --> 22:40.210
I'm not getting on a plane without
them all knowing where I'm going.

22:40.550 --> 22:42.200
Mexico City.

22:42.210 --> 22:44.190
The plane will land in Mexico City.

22:44.200 --> 22:46.720
A car will be waiting
to bring you to me.

22:47.710 --> 22:49.590
Allison...

22:49.620 --> 22:52.090
what's happened here is horrible.

22:52.100 --> 22:54.330
I really need you.

22:57.320 --> 23:00.950
<i>******</i>

23:07.240 --> 23:09.300
Allison,thank you for coming.

23:09.310 --> 23:12.060
I wanted to fill you in
on what's happened here.

23:12.070 --> 23:13.790
But I already know what happened here.

23:13.820 --> 23:16.650
No,I don't think that you do.

23:17.800 --> 23:20.730
Apparently,a radical terrorist faction,

23:20.740 --> 23:26.300
was able to infiltrate Mr. Lydecker's
security force here at his vacation compound.

23:26.310 --> 23:29.340
They slaughtered him,Allison.

23:29.350 --> 23:34.300
Douglas Lydecker was butchered by
zealous anti-capitalists determined

23:34.310 --> 23:38.700
to create chaos in the Western
World and its financial markets.

23:39.020 --> 23:41.790
Really? And did they carve his eyes out?

23:44.050 --> 23:47.380
Why are you protecting him? Why
are you protecting this monster?

23:47.390 --> 23:49.060
It's not about him.

23:49.100 --> 23:53.680
It's about Lydecker Industries and the
tens of thousands of people who work there

23:53.700 --> 23:57.140
and the hundreds of thousands
of people who own stock.

23:57.150 --> 24:03.880
Allison,public appetites,public perceptions--
those are the things that I know a lot about.

24:04.520 --> 24:08.270
You tell the world that
the son killed the father

24:08.280 --> 24:11.470
and you've sullied the
Lydecker name forever.

24:11.490 --> 24:14.250
That is the kind of scandal
that will destroy the company.

24:14.270 --> 24:17.400
Kill sales,crater the stock price.

24:17.410 --> 24:21.690
But you tell the world that
this was the work of terrorists?

24:21.720 --> 24:26.720
Well,you can't buy the public sympathy
and goodwill that will engender.

24:26.730 --> 24:29.770
People will rally around the company.

24:29.810 --> 24:32.810
They'll feel that it's
their duty to do so.

24:32.840 --> 24:37.030
And what about Justin? He's still out
there. What's to say he won't kill again?

24:37.040 --> 24:39.400
I am taking care of it.

24:39.440 --> 24:41.790
I'm going to find Justin
and I will deal with him

24:41.800 --> 24:44.810
in a way that doesn't hurt
the company or either of us.

24:46.280 --> 24:48.160
Us? What do you mean,us?

24:49.390 --> 24:52.070
Us. You and me.

24:52.080 --> 24:54.770
All of our fates are tied
to Justin at this point.

24:54.800 --> 24:57.660
We have all helped to cover his crimes.

24:57.670 --> 25:01.420
If Justin is ever
implicated in this murder,

25:01.460 --> 25:07.850
I have no doubt that he will happily detail everything
we've done to help him elude the authorities.

25:08.300 --> 25:13.900
So,I suggest you wipe that disapproving
look off your face and get on board.

25:14.530 --> 25:16.800
We're in this together,Allison.

25:16.820 --> 25:20.170
And the sooner you
realize that,the better.

25:28.930 --> 25:31.240
I love you.

25:36.890 --> 25:42.160
Young lady. First row? Eyes front.

25:45.140 --> 25:47.660
I think that you really
need to go now,Garrett.

25:47.670 --> 25:48.560
No.

25:48.570 --> 25:50.560
Please.

25:50.570 --> 25:52.810
I love you.

25:52.840 --> 25:55.140
I don't understand.

25:55.150 --> 25:57.780
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

25:57.790 --> 26:00.340
Garrett,don't do this.

26:02.770 --> 26:05.830
I am as low as I can possibly be.

26:07.080 --> 26:09.760
Not that it matters to you but this...

26:10.920 --> 26:14.790
This girl that I was tutoring
privately for the PSATs,

26:15.690 --> 26:19.330
she died in a car accident
a couple weeks ago.

26:19.560 --> 26:21.980
Drowned.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.950
Today was the memorial and...

26:23.980 --> 26:26.940
No,I just... I need to be by myself.

26:28.610 --> 26:31.840
I need to not be worrying about you.

26:33.440 --> 26:35.860
I need you to go.

26:35.890 --> 26:38.720
Please don't make me call somebody.

26:39.140 --> 26:41.730
I'm sorry about the girl.

26:41.740 --> 26:46.350
But I'm staying here. I'm sleeping here.

26:50.160 --> 26:51.980
Put it down.

26:52.700 --> 26:55.950
- Put it down.
- Go.

26:58.090 --> 27:00.700
Don't forget to get a
good night's sleep,folks.

27:00.710 --> 27:03.050
Tomorrow's the big day.

27:09.230 --> 27:11.050
- Miss Snowden?
- Yes?

27:12.820 --> 27:15.330
Do you know somebody named Garrett?

27:21.470 --> 27:24.120
I- I'm sorry.
Wh-What is your name?

27:26.360 --> 27:28.960
Young lady,I'm talking to you.

27:30.150 --> 27:34.590
You seem to know some things about me and I'd
like to know how and I'd like to know your name.

27:43.820 --> 27:45.270
Sir?

27:46.030 --> 27:49.800
Allison. What are you doing here?

27:50.990 --> 27:53.610
Douglas Lydecker's son?

27:53.950 --> 27:56.960
I know I should've told you sooner.

27:56.970 --> 28:00.510
I debated with myself all the way
home on the plane and then I landed,

28:00.530 --> 28:04.030
I called Joe,he told me to drive
right over here from the airport.

28:07.730 --> 28:09.930
I'm so sorry.

28:10.510 --> 28:12.690
You did what you had to
do to protect your family.

28:12.710 --> 28:15.140
I understand that.

28:15.160 --> 28:19.000
You were being threatened by Douglas
Lydecker. That's a formidable threat.

28:19.010 --> 28:23.550
He might still be alive today if I
just ignored him and came right to you.

28:24.940 --> 28:27.520
So,what happens now?

28:28.560 --> 28:31.440
I really don't know.

28:31.660 --> 28:34.750
If the Lydecker boy is truly
at large in a foreign country,

28:34.780 --> 28:37.940
the first step would be
to try to extradite him.

28:37.960 --> 28:41.380
And that's almost impossible to do
without concrete physical evidence.

28:41.390 --> 28:43.080
You can't do anything?

28:43.120 --> 28:45.330
Not at the moment.

28:45.810 --> 28:49.260
I may talk to Justice,ask some
friends of mine there to take a second

28:49.280 --> 28:53.310
and third look at this terrorist thing
with an especially jaundiced eye,but...

28:55.650 --> 28:57.830
What?

28:58.600 --> 29:04.590
I've been quaking in
anticipation of this conversation.

29:05.880 --> 29:10.260
Douglas Lydecker convinced
me that the second that

29:10.310 --> 29:13.690
I even uttered his son's name to you,

29:13.710 --> 29:17.880
the earth was just gonna open up
and swallow me and my family whole.

29:18.780 --> 29:20.530
But...

29:20.550 --> 29:23.940
nothing is different now that we
had this conversation. Nothing.

29:23.950 --> 29:26.490
Nothing's gonna happen.

29:28.490 --> 29:32.340
Except I know that Justin
Lydecker is gonna kill again.

29:32.350 --> 29:36.510
All of us here at the Lydecker
Corporation are obviously still reeling

29:36.520 --> 29:40.750
with the news of the death of our
founder and CEO,Douglas Lydecker.

29:41.070 --> 29:43.680
But I want to reassure
all of our investors,

29:43.730 --> 29:47.920
our customers and our
employees around the globe that

29:47.960 --> 29:52.430
our business operations will
continue without interruption.

29:52.440 --> 29:55.910
I believe to do anything
less would be to suggest that

29:55.950 --> 30:00.140
the savagery that ended this
great industrial titan's life

30:00.150 --> 30:02.570
was somehow effective

30:02.620 --> 30:08.910
and that our founder's belief in the power
of ideas to create worthwhile products

30:08.920 --> 30:13.940
and meaningful employment
was somehow misplaced.

30:14.200 --> 30:18.320
Of course,nothing could be
further from the truth. Thank you.

30:18.330 --> 30:23.680
And that was the scene at a hastily called
press conference in Mexico today where Caitlyn...

30:24.790 --> 30:27.820
Well,I'm glad somebody's
happy about all this.

30:28.330 --> 30:30.790
Devalos actually said there
was nothing he could do?

30:30.820 --> 30:34.520
Well,he needs evidence. He needs
Justin to come back to America.

30:34.530 --> 30:37.880
The first he doesn't
have and the second...

30:37.920 --> 30:39.360
is never gonna happen.

30:39.390 --> 30:42.480
So,he's right,there's nothing to do.

30:42.920 --> 30:48.430
Except of course,for me to find a lawyer
to get me out of this Lydecker contract.

30:50.310 --> 30:52.290
But,hey...

30:52.300 --> 30:55.610
that's why God invented tomorrow.

30:56.780 --> 30:59.560
Can I talk to you for a second?

30:59.970 --> 31:02.730
I didn't know what to do.

31:02.740 --> 31:05.740
But I just didn't believe
that he would hurt her.

31:05.750 --> 31:08.590
Not kill her,anyways.

31:09.140 --> 31:12.500
And I just... I left.

31:13.080 --> 31:15.490
I ran away.

31:15.740 --> 31:21.550
I mean,she doesn't know my name or anything and
she's just a substitute,but I feel like an idiot.

31:23.460 --> 31:28.120
I don't know how I'm gonna go in that classroom
tomorrow and take that test with her standing there.

31:30.360 --> 31:33.340
You think maybe that was the point?

31:33.350 --> 31:37.170
You think maybe Stacey Anne just
wanted to play a big joke on me?

31:37.990 --> 31:41.820
Try and get me to embarrass myself with
the teacher who was gonna proctor the test?

31:41.840 --> 31:44.790
I have no idea,honey,but you
are gonna walk in that classroom.

31:44.820 --> 31:46.400
You are gonna take that test.

31:46.420 --> 31:49.400
Obviously,I'll just be mortified.

31:52.820 --> 31:56.620
I'll just slink in with my head down
and sit in the back and hope that

31:56.670 --> 32:00.520
somehow she doesn't notice
me,doesn't say anything.

32:01.350 --> 32:05.230
What are you saying? That you might
want to take one of those pills?

32:06.210 --> 32:09.090
No,I don't think so.

32:09.100 --> 32:14.100
I think the worst is over. I
think Stacey Anne is done with me.

32:14.900 --> 32:18.440
I think that the hardest part's
gonna be walking through the door.

32:21.440 --> 32:24.200
Go ahead. Pick an artery,Pop.

32:24.210 --> 32:26.300
Which one do you want me to start with?

32:27.010 --> 32:31.040
How about the carotid,huh?
That's always a winner for me.

32:59.770 --> 33:03.390
Diane,are you out there?

33:04.220 --> 33:07.550
Why is someone knocking on my door?

33:12.140 --> 33:14.570
- She knew.
- What?

33:15.040 --> 33:17.520
Caitlyn knew Justin was
gonna kill his father.

33:17.550 --> 33:21.360
She knew it before I did,but she
didn't do anything to stop it.

33:26.460 --> 33:28.580
You knew.

33:29.120 --> 33:30.810
What?

33:30.840 --> 33:33.120
No,"It's good to have you back"?

33:33.130 --> 33:36.440
No,"How was your
flight?" Just,"You knew."

33:36.740 --> 33:39.790
So,what did I know,Allison?

33:39.820 --> 33:42.370
What is it that you think that I knew?

33:42.380 --> 33:44.530
That Justin was gonna kill his father.

33:44.540 --> 33:48.750
When I came here that day to tell you he
wasn't taking his medication,you already knew.

33:48.780 --> 33:52.920
You had dreamt it. You-you...
you just let it happen.

33:52.930 --> 33:55.370
That is quite an accusation.

33:55.390 --> 33:57.890
So what? Now-now you're
just running the place?

33:57.900 --> 33:59.530
Well,temporarily.

33:59.550 --> 34:01.830
Ultimately,that will be up to the board.

34:01.860 --> 34:04.590
But presuming I do a good job...

34:05.380 --> 34:07.910
Allison,this will be good for you,too.

34:07.930 --> 34:12.199
I understand better than most
what a valuable asset you can be.

34:12.210 --> 34:16.969
I understand what a real value
you are to a company like ours.

34:18.489 --> 34:20.710
You let Mr. Lydecker die.

34:20.739 --> 34:24.530
I saw it,Caitlyn. I am onto you,and
I'm not gonna let you get away with it.

34:24.540 --> 34:27.250
Get away with what exactly?

34:28.340 --> 34:30.900
I mean,even if you were
accurate about any of this,

34:30.929 --> 34:35.690
you still haven't suggested that
I actually did anything,have you?

34:35.699 --> 34:41.090
I mean,all that might have happened was
maybe I had a dream and didn't tell anyone.

34:41.100 --> 34:43.889
That's what you're saying,right?

34:45.090 --> 34:47.480
That's not a crime.

34:47.489 --> 34:49.960
Now I need to freshen up.

34:49.980 --> 34:52.550
Have a little contemplation time.

34:52.590 --> 34:55.900
Oh,I was thinking in maybe about
an hour,we'll have a little meeting,

34:55.940 --> 34:59.400
you,me,some of the division leaders.

34:59.440 --> 35:02.900
I have some big plans I'm gonna lay out.

35:02.920 --> 35:06.040
Do you even know where he is? Justin?

35:06.050 --> 35:07.630
He is dangerous!

35:07.690 --> 35:10.090
You told me you were gonna
do something about him.

35:10.100 --> 35:12.890
No. Actually,I have no idea.

35:13.900 --> 35:17.090
That's part of what I
was counting on you for.

35:17.110 --> 35:21.990
Allison,you seem to have a
special dream connection with him.

35:22.340 --> 35:25.530
Caitlyn,you're 11:00 is here.

35:27.600 --> 35:32.760
Allison,I need you to go. I
need to get on with my day.

35:35.980 --> 35:40.360
Oh,Allison,remember,you're
still under contract here.

35:40.800 --> 35:44.550
And I expect you to honor the
same level of confidentiality

35:44.560 --> 35:47.830
that existed before Mr.
Lydecker passed on...

35:47.840 --> 35:51.460
or face the same consequences.

35:52.530 --> 35:57.040
Please take a moment to complete the
personal information in section A.

35:57.050 --> 36:01.920
Take one test booklet and pass
the rest to the person behind you.

36:05.040 --> 36:09.820
And your 25 minutes begins now.

36:10.620 --> 36:13.630
Eyes front,no talking.

36:24.470 --> 36:27.130
Julie,come on! Open the door!

36:27.520 --> 36:29.980
I know you're in there.

36:31.450 --> 36:34.780
It's Wednesday,10:30.
It's a school night.

36:34.790 --> 36:37.730
Don't pretend you can't hear me.

36:39.710 --> 36:42.940
I still got my key. I'm coming in,okay?

36:45.480 --> 36:47.460
Julie?

36:50.920 --> 36:53.730
Julie?

36:57.640 --> 37:00.370
It's Garrett.

37:01.090 --> 37:03.680
I'm coming in,okay?

37:09.800 --> 37:12.730
Julie?

37:42.290 --> 37:45.020
Hey,you okay?

37:46.350 --> 37:50.410
It's okay,honey. Look...

37:50.730 --> 37:54.200
They said that you could take
that test again in a couple months.

37:54.760 --> 37:56.100
Look,I know you're disappointed.

37:56.150 --> 37:58.940
I know you put a lot
of pressure on yourself.

37:59.500 --> 38:02.490
And maybe next time we should
rethink this pill thing.

38:02.510 --> 38:03.730
I mean,if...

38:03.760 --> 38:08.020
if that's what makes it easier for
you to deal with these situations...

38:08.600 --> 38:11.320
Someone's gonna take her eyes.

38:12.010 --> 38:13.990
What?

38:14.020 --> 38:18.530
Miss Snowden...on a
Wednesday,around 10:30,

38:18.540 --> 38:23.300
someone's gonna come into her house
and cut her up and take her eyes.

38:24.270 --> 38:27.500
Diane,can you make my
11:00 a lunch meeting?

38:27.520 --> 38:29.400
I want to go down to R&D in the morning.

38:29.410 --> 38:31.580
- Yes,of course.
- Thank you.

38:33.780 --> 38:38.170
Justin Lydecker,son of recently
deceased billionaire Douglas Lydecker,

38:38.210 --> 38:43.640
was arrested earlier this evening in connection
with a grisly string of murders in the Phoenix area.

38:43.680 --> 38:47.640
We're told the case broke when Justin
Lydecker was caught breaking into

38:47.680 --> 38:50.710
and entering an apartment
of a local teacher.

38:50.750 --> 38:54.510
The authorities have confirmed that
Lydecker had numerous surgical knives

38:54.520 --> 38:57.190
in his possession at
the time of the arrest.

38:57.210 --> 39:00.340
The police are also said to
be investigating a theory that

39:00.380 --> 39:04.280
the young man may actually have been
responsible for his father's death

39:04.290 --> 39:07.160
- in Mexico City earlier this week,
- Oh,my God.

39:07.170 --> 39:08.700
- a murder that was initially...
- Ms.Lynch?

39:08.710 --> 39:10.270
Not now.

39:10.290 --> 39:12.220
I'm sorry,but Allison Dubois is here.

39:12.250 --> 39:14.900
She has the district attorney with her.

39:19.160 --> 39:21.520
Come in. Have a seat.

39:21.530 --> 39:24.760
Thank you,but that's okay.
We won't be staying that long.

39:24.770 --> 39:29.420
I see that you already know about
the arrest of Justin Lydecker.

39:29.430 --> 39:31.760
Yes,I'm-I'm shocked.

39:31.800 --> 39:34.300
I knew he was troubled,but
I had no idea...

39:34.310 --> 39:37.710
Stop,Caitlyn. Just stop.
He knows everything.

39:39.500 --> 39:41.680
Justin-- at the
request of his counsel--

39:41.690 --> 39:45.300
became quite talkative when I took
the death penalty off the table.

39:45.330 --> 39:48.830
He shared some very interesting
information about you.

39:48.840 --> 39:52.670
Apparently,you knew all about
his intentions towards his father.

39:52.680 --> 39:55.660
Said he discussed it with you at length.

39:55.680 --> 40:00.380
That you had tipped him off in advance that
his father planned to transport him to Mexico

40:00.390 --> 40:04.800
and that you even suggested that that might be
the perfect place for him to kill his father.

40:04.810 --> 40:08.970
That you knew you could pay off the right
officials to make it look like an act of terror.

40:09.600 --> 40:11.810
Let me make sure I understand.

40:11.850 --> 40:17.230
You're accusing me of some sort of crime
based on the word of an admitted serial killer?

40:20.470 --> 40:22.360
Well,if that's all you
have,I'm quite confident that

40:22.370 --> 40:27.020
my attorney's will make short
work of these accusations.

40:27.030 --> 40:31.480
Actually,our case doesn't hinge
on Justin's word as much as

40:31.520 --> 40:35.830
on the combined contents of his
voice mail inbox here at Lydecker,

40:35.870 --> 40:38.820
his personal cell phone
text-message records

40:38.850 --> 40:43.590
and the testimony of some of the
officials that you paid off in Mexico.

40:44.730 --> 40:48.180
So do you want to take a moment to make
that phone call to your attorneys now

40:48.210 --> 40:51.460
or would you prefer to
wait till we get downtown?

40:52.010 --> 40:54.410
I'd prefer to make that
call now,if you don't mind.

40:54.440 --> 40:57.170
Not a problem. Mrs. Dubois
and I will wait outside.

40:58.720 --> 41:00.940
Oh,Allison.

41:00.960 --> 41:04.210
I'm sure you'll understand that after
I get off the phone with my attorneys,

41:04.240 --> 41:08.420
I'll be calling Human Resources and
instructing them to terminate your contract,

41:08.450 --> 41:12.160
retrieve you car,collect any
keys,computer data,documents,

41:12.190 --> 41:16.180
any items of clothing that might have
been purchased with corporate funds.

41:16.210 --> 41:20.330
I'll also be sending someone to your
house to retrieve any property that

41:20.370 --> 41:23.770
might have been purchased
with corporate dollars.

41:23.780 --> 41:25.890
You understand, don't you?

41:27.870 --> 41:30.180
Yes, I understand...

41:31.170 --> 41:33.460
and I'm grateful.
