WEBVTT

00:42.520 --> 00:44.340
(Waves roll and rumble)

00:47.400 --> 00:49.379
(Children laugh)

01:16.880 --> 01:18.780
(Rhythmic pounding ofwaves)

01:25.120 --> 01:27.748
- Father would be amazed.
- At our new engine?

01:28.720 --> 01:30.540
At my reading matter.

01:31.320 --> 01:33.504
I think he would approve of both.

01:37.360 --> 01:39.499
(Hissing and clanking)

01:39.680 --> 01:41.784
Trevithick makes bold claims for this engine.

01:42.680 --> 01:44.386
50 fathoms.

01:44.560 --> 01:47.666
- Can it really drain so deep?
- I hope so.

01:47.840 --> 01:50.388
We've just sunk the last of our capital into it.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.027
Free trading is a capital offence.
Take him to Truro Gaol! Stand aside!

02:03.200 --> 02:05.179
No, no!

02:06.880 --> 02:08.302
- Ted!
- Go on!

02:09.520 --> 02:11.021
Ted!

02:18.520 --> 02:20.147
Go on!

02:25.920 --> 02:27.865
- Where were they caught?
- Tregunna Cove.

02:28.560 --> 02:30.380
- Tregunna?
- You may well be surprised!

02:30.560 --> 02:34.018
- Last place anyone'd expect a landing.
- 'Tis why we chose it.

02:34.200 --> 02:35.747
'Tis full 0' rocks an' teasy currents.

02:35.920 --> 02:37.501
So was itjust ill luck?

02:37.680 --> 02:40.023
Or did someone betray us?

02:42.800 --> 02:46.304
Gentlemen, it is a pleasure to have you with us
on our adventure.

02:46.480 --> 02:48.186
Pleasure's ours, Mr Poldark.

02:48.360 --> 02:51.739
The joy's gone out of Leisure
since George Warleggan acquired more shares.

02:51.920 --> 02:55.742
- There's talk 0' lower earnings, even closures.
- That won't happen while I have a stake.

02:55.920 --> 02:58.866
Your stake is now so small as to be insignificant.
As is mine.

02:59.040 --> 03:03.659
All we can do is take our dividends
and watch others make decisions.

03:03.840 --> 03:06.547
Now our affections lie with Grace.

03:06.720 --> 03:10.019
She may be temperamental,
but at least she's ours. Shall we go to work?

03:12.120 --> 03:13.701
Sir?

03:15.040 --> 03:16.541
Thank you.

03:19.080 --> 03:23.107
Ted Carkeek's been arrested.
He's in court this afernoon.

03:24.160 --> 03:26.139
I must go.

03:32.440 --> 03:34.340
My knee still pains me, sir.

03:34.520 --> 03:37.102
- All the time?
- Only when it go stiff.

03:37.280 --> 03:40.340
'Tis like someone turn a key an' lock it.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.548
Dr Choake did advise to...cut it off.

03:43.720 --> 03:48.020
A convenient solution, Charlie. For him.

03:49.920 --> 03:51.387
(Groans)

03:51.560 --> 03:54.666
I want you to keep it bound for a week
until I come to see you again.

03:54.840 --> 03:57.388
I don't see it's needful
for you to be fiddlin' with it so oft.

03:57.560 --> 03:59.187
Rosina would get along fine as she is.

03:59.360 --> 04:03.262
If I can help your daughter, that's surely
a good thing, is it not, Mr Hoblyn?

04:05.720 --> 04:08.621
- Will any ofyou go to court?
- An' see Ted sent for transportation?

04:08.800 --> 04:10.506
- Ha! Or worse.
- Don't say that!

04:10.680 --> 04:13.342
'Tis gauger Vercoe to blame.
He'll not turn a blind eye.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.579
- There's talk of an informer.
- Since when?

04:15.760 --> 04:17.148
Mr Trencrom sent word today.

04:17.320 --> 04:19.663
An' t'ain't like Trencrom to raise false alarm.

04:19.840 --> 04:22.627
- But who_ could it be?
- Trencrom say It could be anyone.

04:30.960 --> 04:32.348
Do I look distinguished?

04:32.520 --> 04:34.909
Perhaps you should be aiming for "severe".

04:35.080 --> 04:37.822
Is that the best way to help Ted, I wonder?

04:38.000 --> 04:40.821
Mighty fligged out for the mine, Francis!

04:41.760 --> 04:43.944
- I'm due in court, Aunt.
- On what charge?

04:44.120 --> 04:46.384
Carrying out my duties as a magistrate.

04:51.760 --> 04:54.342
Come, Master Jeremy,
let's have you scrubbed up.

04:54.520 --> 04:56.226
Ross, I don' think you should go.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.868
Ted is one of my tenants - and workers.

04:59.040 --> 05:00.428
And a fellow free trader!

05:00.600 --> 05:02.864
How will it look if you're seen to sympathise?

05:03.040 --> 05:05.179
As if you're involved - which you are.

05:05.360 --> 05:07.385
Three drops in our cove already this year.

05:07.560 --> 05:09.300
But this was not our cove.

05:09.480 --> 05:11.983
- And no one can point the finger.
- Yet.

05:12.160 --> 05:13.468
What would you have me do?

05:13.640 --> 05:15.028
Not go to court.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.623
And tell Trencrom
he may no longer use our cove.

05:17.800 --> 05:19.427
And save himself our fee?

05:19.600 --> 05:22.706
So we have even less coming in?
Is that what you want?

05:23.920 --> 05:25.103
Are you not afeared?

05:25.280 --> 05:27.384
To think 0' one of our own betrayin' us?

05:27.560 --> 05:30.666
Of course, I'm concerned. I'll be on my guard.

05:31.360 --> 05:34.420
I will look twice at even our closest friends.

05:35.320 --> 05:37.709
- But still go to court?
- I think I must.

05:39.760 --> 05:41.660
I'll fetch my hat.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.865
Was that a yawn, Horace?

05:47.040 --> 05:50.180
Shall you find this place awfully dreary
afer a year in London?

05:50.360 --> 05:53.420
We needn't stay long,
once our engagement's announced tonight.

05:53.600 --> 05:56.467
- Uncle Ray.
- Caroline, my dear.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.386
Well, are you ready to embrace your fate?

06:03.440 --> 06:06.864
Do you suppose Mrs Figg
has any marzipan for Horace?

06:07.040 --> 06:09.588
Shall we ride to Truro and find some for you?

06:09.760 --> 06:11.182
(D09 YaPS)

06:12.320 --> 06:15.744
So...she has agreed to your engagement?

06:15.920 --> 06:17.262
Well, I think so.

06:18.920 --> 06:22.299
Unwin, I seldom entertain.

06:23.120 --> 06:27.420
And the sole reason for tonight's dinner
is to make an announcement.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.145
You'd better be sure there is one.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.065
(Coughing)

06:38.000 --> 06:41.265
That cough has worsened, Aunt.
Would you have me call Dr Choake?

06:41.440 --> 06:43.260
IfI wished to be bled to death.

06:43.440 --> 06:46.739
(Coughs) I've... I've already sent for someone.

06:46.920 --> 06:48.308
Dr Enys?

06:48.480 --> 06:51.779
Someone far more sensible!

07:08.600 --> 07:10.989
(Bell rings, people chatter)

07:16.400 --> 07:18.868
An' that conclude my evidence, Your Worship.

07:19.040 --> 07:23.784
Only to add that I hope 'ee see fit
to send these men to the gallows.

07:23.960 --> 07:27.703
For how else may we break our shores
ofthis iniquitous trade?

07:27.880 --> 07:32.226
We thank you for your diligence, Mr Vercoe.
You may stand down.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.860
- A straightforward case, I think?
-Hmm.

07:35.040 --> 07:39.227
In the context oft_he monstrous events
still unfolding In France?

07:39.400 --> 07:40.867
- I agree with you.
- My concern...

07:41.040 --> 07:42.701
Which I share, is...

07:43.440 --> 07:47.581
how to balance severity ofjudgment
with the appearance of mercy.

07:49.080 --> 07:50.547
The appearance of mercy?

07:50.720 --> 07:55.305
For as you say, our duty is to allay rebellion,
not stoke it.

07:55.480 --> 07:57.107
- But the punishment...
- Oh, I agree.

07:57.280 --> 08:00.226
It should not be a crown ofthorns
for them to wear With pride.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.868
Yet ifthey wish to make martyrs ofthemselves...

08:03.800 --> 08:05.745
Then let us disappoint them.

08:08.040 --> 08:09.860
We both know the type.

08:10.680 --> 08:13.899
- Bone idle.
- One has only to look at them.

08:14.080 --> 08:18.187
Then let us sentence them
to the last thIng that they would seek.

08:20.440 --> 08:24.183
Ignominious...backbreaking...

08:25.640 --> 08:27.585
..without a shred of honour.

08:36.760 --> 08:40.469
Sentenced...to three months' hard labour.

08:40.640 --> 08:42.028
(Murmuring)

08:47.440 --> 08:49.180
ROSS:
I take my hat offto you, Francis.

08:49.360 --> 08:52.739
You played him at his own game.
Something I've never achieved!

08:53.680 --> 08:55.625
Can you live with yourself?

08:55.800 --> 08:56.869
Oh, I think so.

08:57.040 --> 09:00.544
I know for a fact that Halse has brandy
in his cellar which came from such a run.

09:00.720 --> 09:02.460
Don't let that reassure you.

09:02.640 --> 09:06.462
With an informer at large, this won't be the last
case which comes before the court.

09:18.680 --> 09:21.706
Dr Enys. How fares our little backwater?

09:21.880 --> 09:25.225
- A good deal duller than London, I imagine.
- Hmm, you imagine right.

09:25.400 --> 09:29.109
Having just returned, I'm already yawning.
Can you prescribe me a pick-me-up?

09:29.280 --> 09:32.101
- Do your mining interests not invigorate?
- On the contrary.

09:32.280 --> 09:35.625
But perhaps your interest in Wheal Leisure
is not in actual mining?

09:36.880 --> 09:40.907
- I hear you're now physician at Killewarren.
- Mr Penvenen keeps healthy. I rarely see him.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.628
Whereas I saw a good deal of his niece
in London.

09:44.960 --> 09:47.269
- I trust she was well.
- You've not heard from her?

09:47.440 --> 09:51.342
- Nor did I expect to.
- Then her arrival here today, with Unwin,

09:51.520 --> 09:55.183
for their special announcement this evening
will not inconvenience you?

09:55.360 --> 09:56.827
Not in the least.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.661
Good day to you, sir.

10:09.480 --> 10:11.027
Why, Dr Enys.

10:12.480 --> 10:15.142
- How diverting.
- Miss Penvenen.

10:15.320 --> 10:18.744
- How is the scurvy in Sawle?
- Better, I thank you.

10:18.920 --> 10:22.139
The potato crop did not fail this year.
And there were apples.

10:22.320 --> 10:23.901
But no oranges?

10:24.080 --> 10:27.902
Dear me, were there no other ladies
hereabouts to whom you might appeal

10:28.080 --> 10:31.379
and tug on the heart strings,
in the name of charity?

10:33.080 --> 10:36.868
I hope you're in good health, Miss Penvenen.
I...bid you good day.

10:38.080 --> 10:41.345
We meet after a year's absence
and you haven't a civil word for me?

10:42.760 --> 10:47.265
I'm old-fashioned in these matters.
I thought civility should be shown on both sides.

10:49.120 --> 10:50.542
Would you excuse me?

11:03.720 --> 11:06.143
- Verity!
- My dears!

11:13.400 --> 11:15.868
- How is she?
- All the better for seeing you.

11:16.040 --> 11:18.543
I can only stay a few days.

11:29.920 --> 11:31.785
It's good to have you home.

11:50.440 --> 11:52.340
(Inhales)

11:52.880 --> 11:55.019
(Door opens and closes)

11:56.160 --> 11:59.106
Ah...the prodigal returns.

11:59.280 --> 12:00.622
How was London?

12:00.800 --> 12:02.142
Invigorating.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.065
And home to many fine banks.

12:05.240 --> 12:08.027
I wonder, is it not time
we had one of our own in Truro?

12:09.720 --> 12:13.622
I have news...of an interesting document.

12:13.800 --> 12:14.824
Mm?

12:15.000 --> 12:20.063
A promissory note for 1 ,000
with interest at 40%.

12:20.840 --> 12:23.786
The lender believes it will never be repaid.

12:23.960 --> 12:27.828
- Ifwe offered to buy the debt...
- Why would we do that?

12:28.000 --> 12:31.219
Because the debtor would then be at our mercy.

12:43.520 --> 12:45.021
You seem lively tonight.

12:45.200 --> 12:46.622
Could it be that Jeremy's safe abed

12:46.800 --> 12:50.099
and we're dining out at Killewarren
after a year ofturnips and tetty pie?

12:50.280 --> 12:53.704
Take care you don't overdo the port
and trip over Caroline Penvenen's intended.

12:53.880 --> 12:56.781
Perhaps if I did, my husband
would pay me attention.

12:56.960 --> 12:59.349
Have I been so neglectful of late?

12:59.520 --> 13:02.068
Ask your other wife. Grace.

13:02.240 --> 13:05.539
True, she is more taxing than you.

13:06.680 --> 13:08.147
But not as lovely.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.868
So tonight you'll have eyes for none but me?

13:11.040 --> 13:13.543
Tonight I'll have eyes for none but you!

13:14.600 --> 13:16.909
- New dress?
- If only.

13:17.080 --> 13:20.265
- You?
- How I wish.

13:22.400 --> 13:23.583
Shall we go in?

13:26.040 --> 13:29.783
Do you not agree that since I've become an MP,
Cornwall's a better place?

13:29.960 --> 13:31.905
In what regard?

13:32.080 --> 13:35.106
Well, only today we've seen the arrest
of more smugglers.

13:35.280 --> 13:36.941
- For which you take credit?
- Mm.

13:37.120 --> 13:40.146
Since I've made it my mission to curb
lawlessness among the vulgars.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.140
Which reminds me. May I seek your advice

13:42.320 --> 13:45.904
on the shameful lack of banking premises
in Truro?

13:51.840 --> 13:53.421
Awkward?

13:54.480 --> 13:57.301
Not for me.
Last time we met, he went head over heels.

13:57.480 --> 13:59.869
I doubt he'll be keen to repeat the experience.

14:01.080 --> 14:03.059
RAY: Please be seated everyone.

14:03.240 --> 14:05.140
Thank you, sir.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.580
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.

14:20.560 --> 14:24.428
Must you sit here, Unwin? Have you not had
enough of my company in London?

14:24.600 --> 14:26.943
I hope to have it officially after tonight.

14:27.120 --> 14:30.100
Captain Poldark, have you been in any scrapes
since I've been away?

14:30.280 --> 14:32.498
I was most diverted
by your last court appearance.

14:32.680 --> 14:34.819
I try to avoid the place
whenever possible, ma'am.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.787
- By leading a virtuous life?
- I'm attempting to, ma'am.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.383
I fear the execution is often beyond me.

14:43.640 --> 14:46.029
ELIZABETH: She's very striking, isn't she?

14:48.480 --> 14:53.622
Do you believe that what the eye does not
admire, the heart does not desire?

14:53.800 --> 14:56.542
It's always been so with me.

14:58.400 --> 15:00.584
- As you should know.
- Should I?

15:00.760 --> 15:02.227
We see little of each other now.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.265
I'm not sure I know you at all.

15:04.440 --> 15:05.987
Nor I, you.

15:06.160 --> 15:08.264
But that's hardly surprising.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.783
How much did we ever know of each other?

15:11.400 --> 15:14.301
- Even before...
- Before you went away?

15:14.480 --> 15:16.459
It seems like a lifetime ago.

15:17.360 --> 15:18.987
In some ways.

15:19.160 --> 15:21.947
- So you have returned, Captain.
- Aye...er...ma'am.

15:22.120 --> 15:25.465
I was plagued with a fever
and have come back to convalesce.

15:25.640 --> 15:28.939
Well, doubtless you'll enjoy
exploring the coves hereabouts.

15:29.120 --> 15:31.668
Looking for the smugglers, are you, sir?

15:31.840 --> 15:34.866
But surely after your last visit,
you've quite put 'em down?

15:35.040 --> 15:37.258
Aye, but they're damnably sly, ma'am.

15:37.440 --> 15:40.420
One can never be certain how they're disguised.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.623
I hope you do not suppose me to be such a one.

15:44.440 --> 15:46.021
(Laughs and slams table with hand)

15:46.200 --> 15:49.988
It's only now that I realise how young you were
when you promised to marry me.

15:50.160 --> 15:52.742
I should have been old enough
to know my own mind.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.860
Let us agree that you were young.

15:56.720 --> 15:59.507
- And then you thought I was dead.
- Did I?

15:59.680 --> 16:02.581
Or did I think I loved Francis better?

16:05.640 --> 16:07.619
How soon I discovered my mistake.

16:14.920 --> 16:17.548
If it is, then it's against myself.

16:19.400 --> 16:23.541
Is it so astonishing that a woman who changed
her mind once would change it twice?

16:24.440 --> 16:26.340
Cannot a woman love two men?

16:26.520 --> 16:28.579
Cannot a man love two women?

16:28.760 --> 16:31.388
I'm with Francis, and happy to be so.

16:31.560 --> 16:33.027
We're alike in many ways.

16:33.200 --> 16:36.260
But a piece of my heart will always be yours,

16:37.240 --> 16:39.458
as a piece of yours will always be mine.

16:56.560 --> 16:58.903
UNWIN: Treat me
with deference when we are married.

16:59.080 --> 17:00.786
CAROLINE: Ifthat day ever comes.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.621
Then name it, Caroline, I beg you.

17:02.800 --> 17:04.142
I deplore beggars.

17:04.320 --> 17:06.424
How vexing you are!

17:10.200 --> 17:12.145
Infuriating woman!

17:19.160 --> 17:20.821
How is your friend Dr Enys?

17:21.800 --> 17:27.102
Wedded to his work, ma'am,
with no time for distractions.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.703
Would you count me a "distraction"?

17:29.880 --> 17:33.259
I shouldn't presume to connect you
with Dr Enys in any way.

17:33.800 --> 17:37.588
I'm sure he'll wish you well
on the occasion of your engagement.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.909
Aunt Agatha's very angry with me
for calling you.

17:41.080 --> 17:43.708
- What troubles her?
- A cough, a sore throat.

17:43.880 --> 17:46.462
And she tells me a fever,
but I can find no sign of it.

17:46.640 --> 17:48.062
I need no physician.

17:48.240 --> 17:51.266
Little Verity's perfectly capable oftending me.

17:51.440 --> 17:53.908
But when the time comes
for her to return home?

17:54.080 --> 17:55.741
This is her home!

17:55.920 --> 17:58.184
What is there to interest her elsewhere?

17:58.360 --> 18:00.305
A husband?

18:03.040 --> 18:06.339
Trenwith has never been the same
smce she left.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.021
Can you diagnose the complaint?

18:08.200 --> 18:09.701
I'll do my best.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.825
Are you married, sir?

18:13.000 --> 18:15.628
I'm not, ma'am.

18:15.800 --> 18:19.224
- My friends, my friends...
- (Music stops)

18:19.680 --> 18:21.989
..I thank you, one and all,

18:22.160 --> 18:25.539
forjoining me
on this auspicious occasion.

18:25.720 --> 18:28.541
My dear niece, Caroline,

18:28.720 --> 18:32.508
will soon no longer be under my charge.

18:33.120 --> 18:36.305
For in December, she comes of age.

18:36.480 --> 18:37.742
But before that,

18:37.920 --> 18:42.664
I do believe I have to resign her
to the care of another.

18:47.480 --> 18:49.903
Unwin? Where is he?

18:51.600 --> 18:52.669
Caroline?

18:52.840 --> 18:55.343
I believe I saw him heading for his horse.

18:55.520 --> 18:59.627
Oh dear, I hope I haven't said anything
to upset him.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.627
Shall we have dancing?

19:02.800 --> 19:03.949
(Crowd murmurs)

19:04.120 --> 19:05.985
(Music resumes)

19:09.120 --> 19:10.542
Can you tell what ails her?

19:10.720 --> 19:13.700
I have my suspicions. I'll call again tomorrow.
In the meantime...

19:13.880 --> 19:17.668
- What should I give her?
- Honey, juniper, a little warm milk...

19:18.680 --> 19:20.500
..and your very best attention.

19:22.520 --> 19:23.987
Thank you.

19:25.960 --> 19:28.144
(Lively music plays)

19:46.120 --> 19:50.102
There's a novelty. A married couple
who enjoy each other's company.

19:50.920 --> 19:52.785
But then, did they not marry for love?

19:53.800 --> 19:56.303
- Allegedly.
- Dear me! How reckless.

20:03.800 --> 20:05.779
Francis, how good to see you.

20:05.960 --> 20:08.428
I regret I cannot return the compliment.

20:09.600 --> 20:13.582
This spite is pointless, Francis. From your
cousin, I've come to expect no reason...

20:13.760 --> 20:16.069
Then expect none from me.

20:18.760 --> 20:20.227
Good evening, George.

20:22.280 --> 20:23.941
Ross...

20:24.880 --> 20:27.826
I...had not expected to see you here.

20:28.640 --> 20:31.985
Ray Penvenen will insist on inviting the riff-raff.

20:32.920 --> 20:34.785
I hope your new mine prospers.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.666
It will.

20:36.840 --> 20:38.660
I wish I had your confidence.

20:39.640 --> 20:42.985
(Sighs) Must you be envious even ofthat?

20:49.040 --> 20:50.541
(Slams door shut)

20:50.720 --> 20:54.542
We will use whatever means necessary
to acquire that promissory note.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.420
DEMELZA: What Was Elizabeth saying to you?

21:00.600 --> 21:02.306
ROSS: Nothing of importance.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.308
May I join you?

21:54.320 --> 21:55.981
(Hissing and clanking)

22:00.480 --> 22:02.744
The water levels have fallen at least a foot.

22:02.920 --> 22:04.103
By my calculation.

22:04.280 --> 22:06.384
- And you'll continue to monitor them?
- Surely.

22:09.360 --> 22:10.782
What's our plan?

22:10.960 --> 22:13.303
Continue to drain. Tomorrow we blast.

22:13.480 --> 22:16.699
- Then sift the ore, and iﬁNe're luclq...
- Copper!

22:16.880 --> 22:19.986
- (Chuckles)
- The elusive Trevorgie lode!

22:21.320 --> 22:23.026
Let's get started!

22:23.200 --> 22:27.387
I don't mind sayin', when Mr Francis
first came aboard, I had my doubts,

22:27.560 --> 22:29.949
but he's shown himself more'n equal to the task.

22:30.120 --> 22:32.862
- Your sort aren't welcome round here.
- What's that?

22:33.040 --> 22:36.020
'Twill be ol' Nick Vigus.
Folk say he's the informer.

22:36.200 --> 22:38.748
MAN: backstabber round here!
- That wouldn't surprise me.

22:38.920 --> 22:41.707
- (Shouting continues)
- Backstabber, I say!

22:43.200 --> 22:46.658
- Why do these men attack you, Nick?
- No idea, Cap'n.

22:46.840 --> 22:48.387
I ain't done nothin'.

22:48.560 --> 22:51.381
- Why would they think you had?
- Damned if I know.

22:51.560 --> 22:53.027
Damned you may be!

22:53.200 --> 22:56.499
I suspect they attack you
for your habit ofturning against your fellows.

22:56.680 --> 22:57.908
I, sir?

22:58.080 --> 22:59.900
You, sir.

23:00.080 --> 23:03.664
Letting Jim Carter take the blame
for your poaching escapade?

23:03.840 --> 23:07.025
Pocketing George Warleggan's guineas
to testify against me in court?

23:07.200 --> 23:10.465
_ I ain't the informer.
But smce 'ee do accuse me, let me ask,

23:10.640 --> 23:13.347
why shouldn't a man sell himself
to the highest bidder?

23:13.520 --> 23:15.704
Times like this, 'tis every man for himself.

23:15.880 --> 23:18.223
Betray us, you betray yourself.

23:18.400 --> 23:20.584
Fine words for gentlefolk to spout,

23:20.760 --> 23:23.820
with no notion ofwhat it's like to live in squalor,

23:24.000 --> 23:27.629
even if 'ee think 'ee do
by slummin' with scullery maids!

23:30.720 --> 23:32.426
Cap'n Ross! Cap'n Ross!

23:32.600 --> 23:34.340
Let 'im be! Let 'im be.

23:40.720 --> 23:43.029
Have Dr Enys clean him up.

24:25.800 --> 24:29.349
What price would you be willing to pay
for that promissory note?

24:30.840 --> 24:33.388
- Any.
- I thought so.

24:40.360 --> 24:42.225
What will you do with it?

24:44.120 --> 24:46.304
That will depend.

25:09.160 --> 25:10.821
I cannot believe you would call.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.504
After my reception from Francis last night?

25:17.400 --> 25:19.379
I don't expect you to be disloyal to Francis,

25:19.560 --> 25:22.700
but don't you personally think this feud
has gone on long enough?

25:22.880 --> 25:24.461
You know Francis when his mind is set.

25:24.640 --> 25:26.983
He holds you to blame
for the prosecution of Ross.

25:27.160 --> 25:28.229
Ross!

25:29.400 --> 25:32.142
I wish I could enjoy the favour in your eyes
that he does.

25:33.440 --> 25:34.907
But let me be frank with you.

25:35.080 --> 25:37.628
Ross and I have never seen eye to eye.

25:37.800 --> 25:40.462
On my part, it's no more
than a clash of personality.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.267
On his, it's a disease.

25:42.440 --> 25:45.341
He plunges from one disaster to another
and blames me for all ofthem.

25:45.520 --> 25:48.978
- I hardly think that's fair...
- It comes of being born into money.

25:49.160 --> 25:51.139
But with it comes lack ofjudgment.

25:51.720 --> 25:54.462
His ill-conceived smelting venture
was doomed from the start.

25:54.640 --> 25:58.508
When he was out of pocket as a result,
he was too proud to ask friends for assistance

25:58.680 --> 26:03.219
and instead signed a promissory note
for 1 ,000 at 40% interest.

26:03.400 --> 26:05.982
When he ultimately beggars himself,
and Francis with him,

26:06.160 --> 26:09.379
no doubt he'll accuse me of stealing the copper
from his ground overnight.

26:09.560 --> 26:13.269
May I ask...how you learned
ofthis promissory note?

26:15.240 --> 26:18.300
It came into the hands of my Uncle Cary.

26:19.320 --> 26:21.663
And what does your uncle intend to do with it?

26:24.200 --> 26:25.906
To let me deal with it.

26:28.160 --> 26:30.708
Perhaps you'd like me
to make a gift of it to Ross?

26:31.800 --> 26:33.142
Would you?

26:34.760 --> 26:36.739
If I thought he might drop his enmity.

26:38.720 --> 26:40.460
Do you ask it of me?

26:42.000 --> 26:43.786
What would you ask in return?

26:45.560 --> 26:48.222
Merely to be admitted to your friendship again.

26:51.240 --> 26:52.867
I'll see what I can do.

26:56.760 --> 26:58.864
George Warleggan?

26:59.040 --> 27:01.668
I remember the first time
FranCIs brought you here,

27:01.840 --> 27:04.183
fligged out in your frills and fallallery!

27:04.360 --> 27:05.782
I remember it, too.

27:05.960 --> 27:07.461
Speak up, boy, I'm a little deaf.

27:08.800 --> 27:10.540
And still above ground.

27:11.120 --> 27:14.021
There should be a law to kill off old crones.

27:14.720 --> 27:17.029
Velvets and silks you wore.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.339
'Twas plain your mother had no taste.

27:19.520 --> 27:22.068
If you were the last ofthe Poldarks,
I'd do it myself.

27:22.240 --> 27:27.462
And you, staring about like a bull calf
that had strayed from its stall.

27:27.640 --> 27:32.464
But never fear, your great-nephews
are digging their own graves without my help.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.388
Goodbye, old woman.

27:43.040 --> 27:46.624
I hope when I next call, you'll be six feet below.

27:52.360 --> 27:56.660
I expect Jud'll be waitin' for the plantin' to be
finished afore he come sneakin' back?

27:56.840 --> 27:58.501
Don't speak 0' that lizard to me!

27:58.680 --> 28:00.989
- Perhaps he's the informer.
- That braggashans?

28:01.160 --> 28:04.539
- He's too loose-lipped to keep 'is trap shut.
- (Horse neighs and gallops)

28:08.080 --> 28:11.902
While passing your husband's mine, I came
upon a man who was bruised and bleeding.

28:12.080 --> 28:15.186
His name was...Vigus.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.703
I know him. He works there on tribute.

28:17.880 --> 28:21.589
He tells me there's a deal of ill-feeling
about on account ofthe rumours.

28:22.320 --> 28:23.981
Rumours?

28:24.160 --> 28:25.866
Of an informer.

28:26.880 --> 28:31.544
Ah, but you're so out ofthe way here,
perhaps the tales do not reach you.

28:31.720 --> 28:34.382
At any rate, the rumours make people tetchy.

28:35.440 --> 28:38.261
Whoever gave Vigus a beating
must have strong suspicions

28:38.440 --> 28:40.340
as to his involvement in the trade.

28:40.520 --> 28:43.466
And were you able to discover who it was?

28:45.640 --> 28:47.460
No, I was not minded to at this stage.

28:47.640 --> 28:50.382
I hope the assailant will realise his error
and not repeat it.

28:54.640 --> 28:59.179
One can only feel for the man's wife,
having such temper to contend with.

29:02.800 --> 29:05.223
Dr Enys! 'Ave 'ee 'eard 0' Nick Vigus?

29:05.400 --> 29:09.507
Captain Poldark did clout 'im,
yet he swears he's no traitor.

29:09.680 --> 29:11.307
Why would any suspect him?

29:11.480 --> 29:13.539
We all suspect each other, sir.

29:13.720 --> 29:16.541
Do make the blood run cold
to think one of our own be false.

29:16.720 --> 29:18.859
- Dr Enys.
- Charlie!

29:19.040 --> 29:22.942
Do 'ee tell Rosina how my health is mended
since I turn my hand to sail making?

29:23.120 --> 29:25.623
I could provide handsome,
should I choose to wed again.

29:25.800 --> 29:28.303
- Do you have someone in mind?
- Maybe.

29:28.480 --> 29:30.698
Maybe I have someone in mind myself.

29:30.880 --> 29:33.747
Nay, don't 'ee flutter yer eyes at surgeon.
He's not for thee.

29:33.920 --> 29:37.139
Nor for any maid, sir. I'm wedded to my work.

29:48.120 --> 29:51.544
I thought I might find you here,
tending your beloved fisher folk!

29:51.720 --> 29:54.700
If you'll excuse me, Miss Penvenen,
I've no time to...

29:54.880 --> 29:56.461
Let me apologise.

29:56.640 --> 29:59.143
For my discourtesy, the other day.

30:01.600 --> 30:04.819
There. You weren't expecting that.

30:08.760 --> 30:10.864
Do you dislike me so very much?

30:12.040 --> 30:13.905
Dislike?

30:14.920 --> 30:18.105
If coming between me and my work every day
for the last 12 months,

30:18.280 --> 30:21.022
if being unable to forget your voice

30:21.200 --> 30:25.546
or the way you turn your head,
or the lights in your hair,

30:25.720 --> 30:28.029
ifwanting to hear that you're married

30:28.200 --> 30:32.022
and dreading to hear that you're married,
ifthat's dislike...

30:33.720 --> 30:36.268
Perhaps you can identify
these symptoms for me?

30:39.920 --> 30:41.626
Do you ride for pleasure?

30:41.800 --> 30:45.668
I shall be in the woods by Killewarren
just afer eight tomorrow.

30:55.120 --> 30:56.542
DEMELZA: McNeil Was here.

30:57.760 --> 31:01.389
Encouraged by your smiles of last night,
no doubt?

31:01.560 --> 31:04.745
Driven by the sight ofthe bruisin'
you gave Nick Vigus?

31:04.920 --> 31:07.741
You think he comes here for me.
But what if he comes here for you?

31:07.920 --> 31:10.104
- What if he knows something?
- Ofwhat?

31:10.280 --> 31:12.862
Your dealings with Trencrom?

31:13.040 --> 31:14.223
The more he comes calling...

31:14.400 --> 31:16.618
The more likely he is to sniff something out.

31:16.800 --> 31:20.224
You cannot now offer discouragement
without arousing his suspicions.

31:20.400 --> 31:22.140
So I'm to blame?

31:27.280 --> 31:31.387
You missed a treat. _
George Warleggan graced us With his presence.

31:31.560 --> 31:34.267
- What did he want?
- To be reconciled with you.

31:34.440 --> 31:36.624
Is that why he called when my back was turned?

31:36.800 --> 31:39.462
I know he's been vicious in his pursuit of Ross,

31:39.640 --> 31:42.586
but I begin to think he would make amends
if he could.

31:42.760 --> 31:45.900
- How?
- By not taking advantage ofthe power he holds.

31:46.080 --> 31:48.662
You know he owns the ground we walk on.

31:48.840 --> 31:52.788
What harm can it do for you to modify
your hostility towards him?

31:52.960 --> 31:56.066
If only to deter him
from wielding power over us all?

31:59.920 --> 32:01.740
Perhaps I'll ride over and see him.

32:03.480 --> 32:05.380
Wished me dead, he did.

32:05.560 --> 32:08.188
Called me "old crone".

32:09.880 --> 32:11.780
What's that, Aunt?

32:11.960 --> 32:13.780
Big mistake.

32:30.520 --> 32:32.067
Francis.

32:32.640 --> 32:34.301
Elizabeth tells me you called today.

32:34.480 --> 32:37.938
I hope you took the visit
in the spirit in which it was intended.

32:38.120 --> 32:39.462
I believe I did.

32:40.280 --> 32:44.102
And I hope you will take what I have to say
in the same spirit.

32:45.040 --> 32:47.747
You will never again set foot in my house.

32:47.920 --> 32:51.583
Nor approach me, or my family,
including my son.

32:51.760 --> 32:53.785
He is no longer your godson.

32:54.760 --> 32:57.263
We are no longer your friends.

32:58.600 --> 33:00.659
You may turn us out of Trenwith if you wish.

33:01.760 --> 33:06.060
It will be a small price to pay to escape
the noxiousness of your acquaintance.

33:10.600 --> 33:12.227
- (Door slams shut)
- Call in his loans.

33:12.400 --> 33:13.662
Turn 'em out into the fields.

33:13.840 --> 33:17.025
I will not make Elizabeth suffer
for her husband's folly.

33:17.800 --> 33:21.987
And thanks to that promissory note,
I do not need to.

33:25.800 --> 33:28.985
- I cannot but admire Francis.
- What?

33:29.160 --> 33:32.459
Well, he's not as handsome as some,
nor as daring...

33:33.440 --> 33:36.898
..but he has a wisdom,
and he'd value his own skin.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.981
- He'll maybe live longer on that account.
- Do I not have wisdom?

33:40.160 --> 33:43.789
Can you tell if a man
be a traitor to his friends or no?

33:43.960 --> 33:45.905
Perhaps you should have married my cousin.

33:46.080 --> 33:49.902
He's a good man.
He has things that you lack.

33:52.320 --> 33:54.026
Though you have things that he lacks.

33:54.200 --> 33:57.260
Put the two ofyou together
and that would make a complete man.

33:57.440 --> 33:59.465
Do I leave such a lot to be desired?

34:02.120 --> 34:05.260
Yes, Ross. A lot to be desired.

34:45.040 --> 34:47.429
(Whispers) Ssssh! Don't wake Mama.

34:49.720 --> 34:53.622
Papa has to be off early
to the mine to start the blasting.

34:53.800 --> 34:56.940
I'll be home in time to read you a story.

35:13.240 --> 35:15.344
(Mine pump pounding)

35:19.720 --> 35:22.188
I've told Henshawe I'll set the fuses myself.

35:22.720 --> 35:24.426
Shall we go below?

35:24.600 --> 35:26.147
By all means.

35:27.440 --> 35:29.749
I have a feeling our fortunes will change today.

35:29.920 --> 35:33.902
They'll need to,
after what I said to George last night.

35:39.040 --> 35:42.146
- You're in haste.
- I have a rendezvous.

35:42.320 --> 35:43.981
With Caroline?

35:44.160 --> 35:47.425
Don't excite yourself. It'll come to nothing!
We could not be less suited.

35:47.600 --> 35:50.979
- She is an heiress and I am...
- As lowly as a kitchen maid?

35:51.800 --> 35:55.827
May not a woman confer status
as well as a man? Ross raised me up.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.584
And Ross knows he was entirely the winner
in that transaction.

36:08.600 --> 36:09.988
- Ma'am.
- Thank you.

36:11.400 --> 36:14.221
- Yah!
- (Horse gallops away)

36:15.640 --> 36:17.107
Here's to copper, gentlemen.

36:18.400 --> 36:20.027
(Small explosion and fizzing)

36:23.040 --> 36:24.746
(Muffled explosion)

36:47.480 --> 36:51.029
- Anything?
- What do you make ofthis?

36:56.440 --> 37:01.264
Let's collect some more samples,
bring 'em above and examine them fully.

37:02.480 --> 37:05.825
Mistress Poldark above for 'ee, Cap'n.
She say it's urgent.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.582
You go, Ross. I'll stay here.

37:15.720 --> 37:17.506
This came for you.

37:21.520 --> 37:22.987
It's from Pascoe.

37:24.160 --> 37:25.866
I'm wanted in Truro.

37:26.040 --> 37:28.588
- Is it bad news?
- I'll know more when I see him.

37:51.280 --> 37:52.941
I have no idea why I'm here.

37:53.120 --> 37:55.702
Well, then you'll be glad to hear
that I'm leaving today.

37:56.760 --> 37:58.387
Uncle Ray is angry with me.

37:58.560 --> 38:02.144
I suspect he wants me safely locked away
until my marriage.

38:02.760 --> 38:05.706
Which is...to be when?

38:07.080 --> 38:08.707
Who knows?

38:09.280 --> 38:11.669
At any rate, not Unwin. He jilted me.

38:13.600 --> 38:15.261
Or was it the other way round?

38:19.240 --> 38:21.822
Tell me, who is Dwight Enys?

38:23.840 --> 38:27.139
Is he the strong, capable man
that bestrides the sick room

38:27.320 --> 38:29.709
or the hesitant one I see here today?

38:31.280 --> 38:33.589
A man with not the smallest fortune.

38:33.760 --> 38:36.866
Money was never plentiful
and studying took all I had.

38:37.040 --> 38:40.066
I hardly ever met women, except as cases.

38:40.240 --> 38:45.348
So if you come to me with a sore throat,
I know what to do.

38:48.680 --> 38:53.185
you are a creature whose moods and manners
I've never learnt to decipher.

38:53.960 --> 38:58.385
And if you laugh at me, which you frequently do,
I become tongue-tied and foolish.

38:58.560 --> 39:00.061
Poor Dwight.

39:01.800 --> 39:04.303
Do I show such confidence and poise?

39:05.440 --> 39:06.907
How well I've been schooled.

39:07.800 --> 39:11.668
While you were learning to be a physician,
I was learning to be an heiress.

39:12.400 --> 39:14.903
An heiress must learn how to walk,

39:15.080 --> 39:18.664
to dress, to ride, to dance...

39:18.840 --> 39:22.469
You say you don't know women
except as patients.

39:24.640 --> 39:27.029
I don't know men at all.

39:30.600 --> 39:32.386
What would you like to know?

40:02.600 --> 40:06.900
And now...no doubt you hate me.

40:07.680 --> 40:09.659
And now, no douth hate you.

40:15.040 --> 40:16.667
I must go.

40:16.840 --> 40:18.979
Until December.

40:20.280 --> 40:22.100
But nothing will change.

40:22.280 --> 40:24.259
One thing will change.

40:25.600 --> 40:27.784
In December, I come of age.

40:40.320 --> 40:42.868
Did Francis make his peace with George
last night?

40:43.040 --> 40:45.144
Not as far as I know.

40:46.120 --> 40:49.066
When can I go down the mine, Mama?

40:49.240 --> 40:51.788
- When copper is found?
- Will it be?

40:51.960 --> 40:54.428
I've never seen Franci_s
more convmced of anything.

40:54.600 --> 40:56.943
Or more determined to be the one to find it?

40:57.120 --> 41:01.705
He's been so long in Ross's shadow.
I think he wants to earn his admiration.

41:01.880 --> 41:03.461
And yours?

41:04.520 --> 41:09.583
Since it's to be your last night with us,
I've asked Mrs Tabb for a special dessert.

41:09.760 --> 41:11.500
(Mine pump pounding)

41:36.080 --> 41:38.708
Have you seen Captain Henshawe
or Zaclq Martin?

41:38.880 --> 41:41.542
- Jus' missed 'em, sir. Can I be of service?
- Damn.

41:41.720 --> 41:44.666
Erm...no, no matter. I'll ride to Nampara.

41:45.440 --> 41:47.067
Thank you.

41:56.040 --> 41:57.621
Francis.

41:58.120 --> 42:00.020
Ross has not yet returned from Truro.

42:05.120 --> 42:06.906
'Tis never copper?

42:08.000 --> 42:09.627
I hardly dare hope but...

42:11.120 --> 42:13.179
..yes, yes, I think it may be.

42:17.240 --> 42:18.343
(Exclaims)

42:19.360 --> 42:20.987
(Both laugh)

42:21.160 --> 42:25.028
I must get back to the mine. Will you have Ross
take a look when he returns?

42:25.200 --> 42:29.182
Will... Will you not stay and ask him yourself?
He'll be that relieved.

42:29.360 --> 42:31.783
It's my dearest wish to be of use to him...

42:33.760 --> 42:35.625
..to make amends.

42:39.160 --> 42:41.264
You do not ask me
what amends I need to make.

42:42.400 --> 42:43.947
I'm not sure I wish to know.

42:46.800 --> 42:49.109
- Yet I think I must tell you.
- Francis, there's no need.

42:49.280 --> 42:52.067
Years ago, when the Carnmore Copper
Company fought for its life,

42:52.240 --> 42:54.504
George came to me one evening.

42:54.680 --> 42:57.467
Verity had left and I blamed you
for her marriage.

42:59.120 --> 43:03.181
And in my rage I gave George the names
ofthe Carnmore shareholders.

43:07.040 --> 43:10.669
I suspect Ross, and you,
already have some inkling but...

43:13.520 --> 43:16.500
..I've never had the courage
to come and tell you outright.

43:18.240 --> 43:22.381
But you can't rebuild a friendship
by ignoring what destroyed it, so...

43:27.760 --> 43:29.227
..so now you know.

43:30.840 --> 43:32.387
- I'll go now.
- Wait, Francis.

43:32.560 --> 43:35.620
Ifwe break now,
we'll only hurt each other all the more.

43:37.600 --> 43:41.422
One bad thing does not outweigh
the many good.

43:44.280 --> 43:46.669
'Tis the balance that counts.

43:47.880 --> 43:49.268
You believe that?

43:53.440 --> 43:56.659
(Exhales)
I don't wonder Ross loves you.

43:59.040 --> 44:01.349
Do you suppose he still does?

44:03.760 --> 44:05.261
You doubt it?

44:08.120 --> 44:10.463
Sometimes I think he loves Elizabeth better.

44:17.960 --> 44:20.178
May I tell you something, Demelza?

44:24.480 --> 44:26.664
You have one failing.

44:28.000 --> 44:31.219
And that is that you don't think well enough
of yourself.

44:32.960 --> 44:34.939
You came here as a miner's daughter

44:35.120 --> 44:38.578
and married into this ancient family.

44:39.920 --> 44:42.024
And you took its standards as your own.

44:42.960 --> 44:44.587
So you mistake your own value.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.468
Ross was a wise man when he chose you.

44:51.840 --> 44:53.660
He will not forget it.

44:53.840 --> 44:58.618
But Elizabeth is...so lovely, well bred.

45:00.160 --> 45:02.185
And she's Ross's first love.

45:03.920 --> 45:06.184
How can I compete with perfection?

45:06.360 --> 45:10.581
You must do away with the notion
that someone has done you a favour

45:10.760 --> 45:12.660
by letting you into this family.

45:15.240 --> 45:16.787
Will you do that?

45:18.800 --> 45:20.506
I'll try.

46:09.720 --> 46:12.905
George Warleggan has my promissory note?

46:15.240 --> 46:16.901
Alas so.

46:18.040 --> 46:22.784
I'd not expect much sympathy
for any request to extend the loan period.

46:37.160 --> 46:39.139
- Night, sur.
- Good night, sur.

46:45.480 --> 46:47.459
(Rumbling and pounding of pump)

47:02.400 --> 47:05.107
- Is it s_erio_us? _
- Yes. And phy5ic Will not cure it.

47:05.280 --> 47:08.659
- What will?
- Your presence here is What she craves.

47:08.840 --> 47:11.263
- And you have a life elsewhere.
- So what's to be done?

47:11.440 --> 47:14.989
In matters ofthe heart,
I think you must be the physician, ma'am.

47:16.560 --> 47:18.141
Thank you.

47:31.400 --> 47:32.867
I must leave you tomorrow, Aunt.

47:33.920 --> 47:36.627
I have a husband and a home to return to.

47:37.360 --> 47:40.625
But they don't need you
as Trenwith needs you.

47:40.800 --> 47:43.018
'Tis not as if you have children.

47:43.840 --> 47:48.140
And the cards.
Today they threaten some impending ill.

47:48.320 --> 47:51.426
Which perhaps only you can prevent?

47:57.360 --> 47:59.499
(Coughs and sniffs)

48:32.000 --> 48:33.308
(Gasps)

48:44.800 --> 48:46.939
- (Rock collapses)
- Aagh!

48:54.800 --> 48:56.665
(Gasps and splutters)

48:56.840 --> 48:58.467
Help me!

49:06.560 --> 49:07.629
(Grunts)

49:10.040 --> 49:12.429
Is there anybody there?

49:12.600 --> 49:14.261
Help me!

49:17.000 --> 49:18.183
Help!

49:22.840 --> 49:24.660
Will Francis be dining With us?

49:24.840 --> 49:26.785
I've sent to Nampara for him.

49:37.120 --> 49:38.542
(Door closes)

49:38.720 --> 49:40.665
(Footsteps approach)

49:41.720 --> 49:44.143
My debt is in the hands ofthe Warleggans.

49:45.880 --> 49:50.340
- By Christmas I must find 1 ,400.
- Or else?

49:50.520 --> 49:53.262
We lose everything we own
and I go to debtors' prison.

49:53.440 --> 49:54.828
(Footsteps approach)

49:55.000 --> 49:58.629
Someone come from Trenwith
lookin' for Mr FranCIs.

49:58.800 --> 50:00.665
Is he not at the mine?

50:01.600 --> 50:03.147
At this hour?

50:03.320 --> 50:05.185
Help!

50:07.600 --> 50:09.500
Somebody!

50:10.560 --> 50:12.221
(Grunts)

50:13.440 --> 50:15.419
(Gasps)

50:20.280 --> 50:22.259
(Groans and Winces)

50:33.000 --> 50:35.218
HENSHAWE:
I came as quickly as I could.

50:35.800 --> 50:37.427
Is it Mr Francis?

50:37.600 --> 50:41.104
I think he may still be down below.
No one's seen him for hours.

50:41.920 --> 50:43.467
Demelza, wait here.

50:48.360 --> 50:50.749
(Coughs and groans)

50:59.200 --> 51:01.862
Some ofthe men saw him
heading for the 30 level.

51:02.040 --> 51:04.941
Then we start there and work our way through.

51:09.080 --> 51:10.980
Francis?

51:15.120 --> 51:17.020
(Verity reads quietly)

51:20.480 --> 51:22.186
(Reads aloud)

51:25.360 --> 51:27.339
(Clock ticks)

51:40.840 --> 51:42.580
Thank you, Prudie.

51:45.080 --> 51:48.982
Captain Henshawe sent for me.
Is it an accident?

51:50.040 --> 51:51.826
Francis is missing.

51:52.000 --> 51:53.786
(Laboured breathing)

51:55.200 --> 51:58.180
(Echoing laughter and waves breaking)

52:03.760 --> 52:05.739
(Children's laughter echoes)

52:08.280 --> 52:12.068
Francis?

52:12.240 --> 52:14.265
- Let's try the lower levels.
- Go easy.

52:14.440 --> 52:17.386
There's still a lot ofwater down there.

52:18.600 --> 52:20.101
(Clock ticks)

52:47.520 --> 52:49.181
(Echoing laughter)

52:52.240 --> 52:55.983
Ross! Help me!

52:56.160 --> 52:58.219
(Weakly) Ross.

53:00.240 --> 53:01.821
ROSS: (Distant) Francis!

53:04.160 --> 53:05.866
Francis!

53:10.400 --> 53:12.186
Francis, are you there?

53:13.240 --> 53:15.424
- Ross?
- FranCIs?

53:15.600 --> 53:17.340
Ross.

53:19.440 --> 53:22.261
- Give me your hand.
- I knew you'd come!

53:26.080 --> 53:27.581
(Water Whooshes)

53:31.840 --> 53:33.546
(Muffled water whooshing)

53:36.520 --> 53:38.465
(Whispers) Ross...

53:40.960 --> 53:42.860
(Water bubbling echoes)

Mr Francis!

That's your father's horse.
I'll see if supper's ready.

I'll go.
