Cheers <i>is filmed</i>        
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i>

00:05.788 --> 00:06.938
Refill, Mr. P.?

00:06.971 --> 00:08.673
Yeah.              
    ( <i>knuckles crack</i> )

00:08.708 --> 00:10.609
Eww! Knuckle cracking.

00:10.643 --> 00:12.176
I hate that sound.

00:12.211 --> 00:13.311
And you hurt your fingers.

00:13.345 --> 00:14.345
CLIFF:  
                        Woodrow,

00:14.380 --> 00:16.681
knuckle cracking                
is relatively harmless.

00:16.716 --> 00:17.866
Actually,

00:17.900 --> 00:19.201
when you                        
crack your knuckles,

00:19.235 --> 00:22.070
what you're doing is really,    
uh, breaking a sound barrier.

00:22.104 --> 00:24.639
Yeah, what you hear             
is actually

00:24.673 --> 00:27.709
a tiny finger-sized             
sonic boom.

00:27.743 --> 00:29.444
Well, Cliff,          
      you're partly right.

00:29.478 --> 00:32.046
Really? Which part?

00:32.081 --> 00:35.317
The phenomenon of knuckle       
cracking is relatively harmless.

00:35.351 --> 00:36.952
But in fact,          
    the sound you're hearing

00:36.986 --> 00:38.753
is not a cracking at all,

00:38.787 --> 00:41.589
but rather a popping      
      of tiny gas bubbles

00:41.623 --> 00:42.790
imploding               
     in the sinovial fluid

00:42.825 --> 00:44.092
of the metacarpal           
    phalangeal joint.

00:44.126 --> 00:45.827
Makes sense.

00:45.861 --> 00:47.229
NORM:       
                    Yeah, but

00:47.263 --> 00:49.397
knuckle-cracking        
 doesn't make a popping sound.

00:49.431 --> 00:50.866
A popping sound         
    is more like this.

00:50.900 --> 00:51.967
( <i>popping sound</i> )

00:52.001 --> 00:53.869
Oh, God,                        
I could never do that.

00:53.903 --> 00:54.836
You know what else              
I could never do?

00:54.871 --> 00:56.604
I could never whistle           
with my fingers.

00:56.638 --> 00:57.739
Carla can do that great.

00:57.773 --> 00:58.690
Hey, Carla, show Woody

00:58.724 --> 00:59.841
how you whistle     
            with two fingers.

00:59.876 --> 01:01.009
Sure.

01:01.043 --> 01:01.726
First, you have                 
to crack your knuckles.

01:01.760 --> 01:02.810
( <i>cracking sound</i> )

01:02.844 --> 01:05.280
Ooh, sinovial fluid imploding!

01:05.313 --> 01:06.680
I hate that sound!

01:07.533 --> 01:09.851
You'll hurt your metacarpal   
    phalangeal joint.

Carla,

01:55.030 --> 01:56.497
can you help me                 
with this zipper, please?

01:56.532 --> 01:57.798
Sure, boss.

01:57.833 --> 02:01.068
You know, when you first        
walked in in this dress,

02:01.103 --> 02:04.071
you were like the closest thing 
to Cher I've ever seen.

02:04.106 --> 02:05.273
Really?

02:05.307 --> 02:07.442
Yeah, you looked                
just like Sonny Bono.

02:07.476 --> 02:09.610
Carla, I don't    
              have time to trade
              insults with you.

02:09.645 --> 02:10.645
Oh, that's okay.

02:10.679 --> 02:12.647
You can still keep mine.

02:12.681 --> 02:13.648
There you go.

02:13.682 --> 02:15.683
Now, be careful when you unzip.

02:15.718 --> 02:17.985
I think I snagged about     
a dozen little back hairs.

02:18.019 --> 02:19.871
Thank you, Carla.

02:19.905 --> 02:20.672
Big date, Rebecca, huh?

02:20.706 --> 02:22.623
Who's the lucky fella?

02:22.657 --> 02:24.558
Somebody I met
                  at a party.

02:24.593 --> 02:26.494
A rich doctor--
                 cardiologist.

02:26.528 --> 02:27.929
Leader in his field.

02:27.963 --> 02:29.864
You guys couldn't   
            wipe his nose.

02:29.899 --> 02:32.433
That shoots my plans      
        for the evening.

02:33.235 --> 02:36.070
Where, uh,                      
where's he taking you?

Wow, can you get

Woody, this is

02:49.685 --> 02:51.486
The USS <i>Constitution.</i>

02:51.520 --> 02:53.121
I know; I was reading           
about it in the paper.

02:53.155 --> 02:54.289
Raymond Burr's

( <i>gasping</i> ):          
  Oh, God, I'm gonna be late.

Wow, nice earrings.

03:08.670 --> 03:09.770
Thank you.

03:09.805 --> 03:10.655
No, I meant Carla's.

03:12.308 --> 03:13.875
Oh, thanks.

03:15.110 --> 03:17.812
Although, yours are     
        actually pretty nice,   
        too.

03:17.846 --> 03:18.813
Thank you.          
                Are they real?

03:18.847 --> 03:19.881
Yes,              
they're genuine diamonds.

03:19.915 --> 03:22.284
No, I mean are they 
            real little bananas.

Evening, folks.

03:26.689 --> 03:28.022
( <i>wolf whistle</i> )

03:28.056 --> 03:29.524
Thank you, Woody.

03:29.558 --> 03:30.792
Yeah, Carla                     
just taught me that.

03:30.826 --> 03:31.893
You were right, Carla.

03:31.927 --> 03:33.928
All I needed was                
a little more slobber           
on my fingers.

03:35.564 --> 03:38.166
Sammy, all      
                decked out, huh?

03:38.200 --> 03:39.901
Yeah, my date's gonna pick me up
    in a couple of minutes.

03:39.935 --> 03:41.169
We're going to go over     
        to that shindig

03:41.203 --> 03:43.905
they're throwing        
    at the USS <i>Constitution.</i>

03:43.939 --> 03:46.758
Oh, Sammy, how'd you            
wrangle a ticket                
to that sea-going soiree?

03:46.792 --> 03:50.061
Well, you know...               
the event's going               
to be televised.

03:50.095 --> 03:52.329
So they wanted to fill          
the audience

03:52.364 --> 03:54.799
with, a lot of, you know,       
    big, local celebrities.

03:54.833 --> 03:56.083
Yeah, one of them has      
     to go to the bathroom,

03:56.118 --> 03:57.552
you rush down          
     and fill in the seat.

03:59.822 --> 04:01.389
Yeah.

04:03.108 --> 04:06.177
You know, I happen to be going  
to that exact same event.

04:06.211 --> 04:08.479
Perhaps when I get up           
to go to the powder room,

04:08.513 --> 04:09.547
you can grab my seat.

04:09.582 --> 04:10.582
Heck, turn around.

04:10.616 --> 04:12.349
I'll do it right now.

04:14.403 --> 04:15.252
Come on, Rebecca.   
            Fess up.

04:15.287 --> 04:16.837
We know you're     
             just a seat filler.

04:16.872 --> 04:17.622
I am not!

04:17.656 --> 04:20.375
I told you I was going     
      with a cardiologist.

04:20.409 --> 04:23.177
A very good-looking       
         cardiologist.

04:23.212 --> 04:24.412
Oh, yeah? As good-looking       
as Sammy here?

04:24.446 --> 04:25.747
Please, he's better-looking.

04:25.781 --> 04:26.781
Oh, yeah?

04:26.815 --> 04:28.165
Well, my date's
                 so good-looking

04:28.199 --> 04:30.234
that when the two   
            of us walk down     
            the street,

04:30.268 --> 04:31.936
people actually
                 look at her.

04:34.940 --> 04:36.240
Oh, yeah?

04:36.275 --> 04:40.678
Well, my date has saved many,  
 many lives, and has two homes.

04:40.712 --> 04:44.666
Yeah? Well, my date's      
     a high-fashion model

04:44.700 --> 04:46.367
and she's known         
    on two continents.

04:46.402 --> 04:47.735
Oh, yeah?      
                 Which two, Sam?

04:47.769 --> 04:49.571

05:01.266 --> 05:03.685
No, it's no bother,       
         I don't mind.

specialist decided to stay home

and wash his hair tonight.

05:13.028 --> 05:14.161
He did not.

05:14.196 --> 05:15.963
He has an emergency bypass.

05:15.998 --> 05:17.665
Yeah, he had to bypass you.

05:22.387 --> 05:24.088
I'm telling you the truth.

05:24.123 --> 05:25.623
Boy, you know, it's so pathetic

05:25.657 --> 05:27.659
when you're     
                all dolled up

05:27.693 --> 05:30.361
and no place to go,
             isn't it?

05:30.395 --> 05:32.296
Oh, Sam, that reminds me.

05:32.331 --> 05:33.331
Jacqueline called.

05:33.366 --> 05:35.132
She can't make it tonight.

05:36.635 --> 05:37.501
You're right, Sam.

05:37.536 --> 05:38.903
That is pathetic.

05:38.937 --> 05:40.254
But I'm sure your date

05:40.289 --> 05:41.789
didn't have     
                any lousy excuse

05:41.823 --> 05:43.424
like heart surgery.

05:43.459 --> 05:45.192
As a matter of fact,
            she's very sick.

05:45.227 --> 05:47.078
Sick of you.

a good time     
                tonight, Sam.

05:52.167 --> 05:53.668
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  
            Listen.

Here we are,

 looking like a million bucks.

the two of us storm

05:59.007 --> 06:01.241
the old USS <i>Constitution</i>        
<i>together, huh?</i>

06:01.276 --> 06:02.910
I don't think so.

06:02.945 --> 06:06.647
Oh, are you so depressed        
about being stood up?

06:06.682 --> 06:07.648
No.

06:07.683 --> 06:09.149
I just don't want           
        to go with you.

06:09.184 --> 06:10.751
Wait a minute.

06:10.786 --> 06:13.087
You spent all day               
getting dressed up

06:13.121 --> 06:14.455
and you're trying               
to tell me

06:14.490 --> 06:16.156
that you'd rather stay          
in this bar

06:16.191 --> 06:17.191
than go out with me?

06:17.225 --> 06:18.693
No, Sam,

06:18.727 --> 06:19.760
I am trying to tell you

06:19.795 --> 06:21.462
that I would rather       
remove my own gall bladder

06:21.497 --> 06:25.032
with an oyster fork       
     than go out with you.

06:27.686 --> 06:30.121
Why do you say                  
these things to me?

06:30.155 --> 06:32.257
I mean, how come                
I turn you off so much?

06:32.291 --> 06:33.524
I don't know.

06:33.558 --> 06:34.558
It's just one  
                 of those things

06:34.593 --> 06:35.559
you have            
            to take on faith.

06:35.594 --> 06:36.928
It's kind of like   
            I don't know

06:36.962 --> 06:38.629
that the refrigerator   
        light goes off

06:38.663 --> 06:40.098
for sure when       
            I close the door.

06:40.132 --> 06:43.268
Well, obviously you never tried 
  closing it from the inside.

06:50.042 --> 06:51.576
Hey, everybody.

06:51.610 --> 06:53.678
Guess who I brought
             back with me?

06:53.712 --> 06:55.196
Sam, how'd you do it?

07:01.487 --> 07:03.354
Chairman of the Joint       
    Chiefs of Staff, himself.

07:03.389 --> 07:04.489
WOODY:            
              Now wait a minute.

07:04.523 --> 07:06.474
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
            of Staff

07:06.509 --> 07:08.209
is a doorman          
      at the Ritz Carlton?

07:09.845 --> 07:12.430
No wonder they charge you       
      so much over there.

07:12.465 --> 07:14.466
Woody, this really          
        is the Chairman

07:14.500 --> 07:16.367
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

07:16.401 --> 07:18.069
He was at the same dinner I was.

07:18.103 --> 07:21.038
The Navy can't afford to pay  
the salary of a doorman, Woody.

07:21.073 --> 07:22.306
You know that.

07:22.341 --> 07:25.577
He recognized me        
from my ball-playing days.

07:25.611 --> 07:28.245
Nobody gives up tearing     
home runs like Sam Malone.

07:28.280 --> 07:30.131
Thanks.

07:30.165 --> 07:32.666
I wish our missiles       
    flew as high and as far.

07:35.003 --> 07:36.671
Admiral                         
William J. Crow, Jr.,

07:36.705 --> 07:38.339
promoted to Admiral             
in 1974.

07:38.373 --> 07:40.641
In 1983 commanded               
U.S. Pacific Command.

07:40.676 --> 07:44.778
In 1985, appointed 11th Chairman
 of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

07:44.813 --> 07:46.380
Wife, Shirley.

07:46.415 --> 07:47.564
I'm impressed,
                  young man.

07:47.599 --> 07:49.000
How come you know   
            so much about me?

07:49.034 --> 07:51.769
Simple, sir. I'm an American.

07:54.739 --> 07:56.941
Clifford Clavin,                
U.S. Postal Service, sir.

07:56.975 --> 07:58.742
Nice to know you,           
          Mr. Clavin.

07:58.777 --> 08:00.945
Us guys in uniform    
          got to stick together.

08:00.979 --> 08:02.146
Yes, sir.

08:02.181 --> 08:03.080
Were you ever   
                in the Navy?

08:03.115 --> 08:04.765
No, sir, I wanted to be

08:04.799 --> 08:07.501
but the old asthma          
 started kicking up, you know.

08:07.536 --> 08:10.504
So, uh, so I joined       
the U.S. Postal Service instead.

08:10.539 --> 08:12.072
I figured if I couldn't serve

08:12.107 --> 08:14.442
I should at least           
deliver the draft notices

08:14.476 --> 08:17.261
to those who could.

08:17.296 --> 08:19.830
Admiral, hi.

08:19.864 --> 08:20.648
Hi.

08:20.682 --> 08:21.666
I'm Rebecca Howe.

08:21.700 --> 08:23.501
It is truly an honor            
to have you

08:23.535 --> 08:25.803
in our bar.

08:25.838 --> 08:27.772
It's an honor  
                 for me as well.

08:27.806 --> 08:30.007
Is there anything               
I can do for you?               
Anything at all?

08:30.041 --> 08:32.643
Well, for starters,
             you might go out   
             with Sam Malone.

08:32.678 --> 08:34.544
I hate to see a man
             in constant pain.

08:37.499 --> 08:38.832
Maybe you could ask me

08:38.866 --> 08:40.735
to do something                 
more enjoyable.

08:40.769 --> 08:42.970
Like, say, a commando mission   
in Libya?

08:43.856 --> 08:45.506
I tried, Sam.

08:46.675 --> 08:48.443
Hey, Ad, park it.

08:52.147 --> 08:53.197
I'm Carla Tortelli LeBec.

08:53.232 --> 08:54.298
Hello, Carla.

08:54.333 --> 08:56.684
I was wondering if              
I could ask you a favor.

08:56.718 --> 08:57.785
Sure.

08:57.820 --> 08:59.754
If you're ever                  
on the USS <i>Lexington,</i>

08:59.788 --> 09:02.222
could you find out              
why nobody has ever called

09:02.257 --> 09:05.359
or dropped a note               
or sent a card?

09:05.393 --> 09:07.562
That must be        
            a hell of a ship.

09:07.596 --> 09:09.346
I've had better.

09:13.235 --> 09:16.137
Oh, well, well, well.

09:16.171 --> 09:17.038
What do we have here?

09:17.072 --> 09:21.042
The Chairman                    
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

09:21.076 --> 09:22.243
Mm-hmm.

09:24.179 --> 09:25.013
Hello there, sir.

09:25.047 --> 09:26.114
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.

09:26.148 --> 09:27.115
Hello, Doctor.

09:27.149 --> 09:28.682
This is my number.

09:28.717 --> 09:31.486
I have treated Napoleon,        
Teddy Roosevelt,

09:31.520 --> 09:33.687
and I know I could help you.

09:36.825 --> 09:39.026
Doctor, I really am the Chairman
 of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

09:39.060 --> 09:40.561
Aye, aye, Admiral.

09:40.595 --> 09:42.362
But I'll keep your card.

09:42.397 --> 09:43.831
I know a lot of people     
        in the Pentagon

09:43.865 --> 09:45.032
that could use your services.

09:52.173 --> 09:53.524
Hey, Admiral, thanks.

09:53.558 --> 09:55.292
These are great hats.

09:55.327 --> 09:57.145
Hats don't win wars;            
ideas do.

09:57.179 --> 09:59.413
Now sir,                        
here's what separates

09:59.447 --> 10:02.166
my submarine concept            
from everybody else's.

10:02.200 --> 10:06.270
You see, mine's got wheels.

10:08.573 --> 10:11.992
Uh, I understand, Cliff.

10:13.562 --> 10:14.762
It's getting late.

10:14.796 --> 10:16.847
Sam, thanks                     
for the autographed baseball.

10:16.881 --> 10:17.848
Oh, yeah, listen.

10:17.882 --> 10:19.049
If the President                
wants one of those,

10:19.083 --> 10:20.050
he knows where to get me.

10:20.084 --> 10:21.469
I'm sure you'll     
            be hearing from him.

10:21.503 --> 10:22.570
Norm...

10:22.604 --> 10:24.638
Later.

10:24.673 --> 10:26.840
Uh, sir, these plans
            I've drawn up

10:26.875 --> 10:28.642
for the new     
                assault vehicle,

10:28.677 --> 10:30.244
where should
                    I send them?

10:30.279 --> 10:32.396
Just send them to the Pentagon, 
             Cliff.

10:32.430 --> 10:33.030
Yes, sir.

10:33.065 --> 10:34.849
Sir, I'm a little bit

10:34.883 --> 10:36.100
worried about that,
             though.

10:36.134 --> 10:37.602
If I send them  
                to the Pentagon,

10:37.636 --> 10:39.103
they might get lost.

10:40.606 --> 10:42.273
Very definitely         
send them to the Pentagon.

10:43.341 --> 10:45.009
Yes, sir.

10:45.043 --> 10:47.344
Am I lucky or what?

10:47.379 --> 10:49.914
One of the most
                 famous people  
                 in the country

10:49.948 --> 10:53.017
comes into my bar,      
        and I am dressed for it.

10:53.052 --> 10:53.985
By the way, Rebecca,

10:54.019 --> 10:55.987
when are you going              
to take that thing off?

10:56.021 --> 10:58.088
Oh, I might just dress this way 
         all the time.

10:58.123 --> 11:01.392
It makes me feel all at once  
  desirable and businesslike.

11:01.426 --> 11:02.293
You got a point.

11:02.411 --> 11:04.945
About a half dozen guys asked me
how much you charge.

11:06.314 --> 11:08.783
By the way, if anyone   
        says "Carla sent me,"

11:08.817 --> 11:10.050
you owe me five bucks.

11:11.787 --> 11:13.287
Carla, I'm just about           
to have a break.

11:13.321 --> 11:14.455
You think you can               
teach me

11:14.489 --> 11:17.058
to make raspberry sounds        
with my armpit?

11:17.092 --> 11:18.325
No, no, I've got

11:18.360 --> 11:21.028
to be wearing a tank top
        to get the full effect.

11:23.665 --> 11:25.566
But you know,      
             I can teach you how

11:25.600 --> 11:27.501
to make blue sparks
             in your mouth

11:27.535 --> 11:29.003
with a Lifesaver candy.

11:30.773 --> 11:31.939
They're gone!

11:31.974 --> 11:32.622
Who's gone?

11:32.657 --> 11:35.142
My diamond earrings.      
         They're gone.

11:35.176 --> 11:36.376
Calm down.              
     Where'd you put them?

11:36.411 --> 11:38.913
I had them in a tumbler,    
    and I put it on my desk,

11:38.947 --> 11:40.180
and nobody                      
was in there but me.

11:40.214 --> 11:41.749
And my door was locked          
the whole time

11:41.783 --> 11:43.617
and I was the only one          
that was in there.

11:43.652 --> 11:44.919
No, no, the Admiral went    
in there to use the phone.

11:46.922 --> 11:48.823
You're right.

11:48.857 --> 11:51.058
He was in there alone.

11:51.093 --> 11:52.793
Oh, Lord.

11:53.962 --> 11:56.463
The Chairman of the Joint   
    Chiefs of Staff

11:56.498 --> 11:58.465
of the United States
            of America,

11:58.500 --> 11:59.667
stole my earrings!

12:11.546 --> 12:13.964
Oh! I just don't believe this!

12:13.998 --> 12:17.367
And he seemed like              
such a nice Chairman

12:17.402 --> 12:20.137
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

12:20.171 --> 12:21.388
Rebecca Howe,          
    this smacks of treason.

12:21.422 --> 12:22.422
I've got                        
a good mind

12:22.457 --> 12:23.791
to place you under arrest.

12:23.825 --> 12:25.876
Cliff, if you                   
had a good mind,

12:25.911 --> 12:27.878
you would                       
still be stupid.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.213
SAM:            
                Hey, come on.

12:29.247 --> 12:31.282
Why would anyone who
            has a super job,

12:31.316 --> 12:32.482
makes a great living,

12:32.517 --> 12:34.518
and can shop at     
            any PX in the world,

12:34.552 --> 12:36.086
want to steal   
                your earrings?

12:36.121 --> 12:37.955
You saw them.          
      They were gorgeous.

12:37.989 --> 12:39.223
CLIFF:                          
All right,                      
that's it.

12:39.257 --> 12:43.760
Rebecca Howe, I would like      
  your social security number.

12:43.795 --> 12:44.761
Oh, Cliff, shut up.

12:44.796 --> 12:45.930
NORM:       
                    All right,  
                    wait, wait.

12:45.964 --> 12:47.064
Maybe he did take them.

12:47.098 --> 12:49.099
Oh, great.              
    Seditionists everywhere.

12:49.134 --> 12:51.402
No, no. Maybe the guy had       
an anniversary coming up,

12:51.436 --> 12:54.038
and he didn't have time to shop 
because he's too damn busy

12:54.072 --> 12:55.039
running the military.

12:55.073 --> 12:57.507
No, no. That doesn't wash, Norm.

12:57.542 --> 13:00.010
His anniversary   
              was February 14th.

13:00.045 --> 13:00.477
All right, Cliff.   
            All right.

13:00.511 --> 13:01.611
Maybe this, okay?

13:01.646 --> 13:03.547
Maybe he wears  
                them himself.

13:03.582 --> 13:05.749
Yeah, right.                    
He wears earrings

13:05.783 --> 13:07.851
and I wear                      
women's lingerie.

13:07.885 --> 13:10.120
Carla,          
                you were right.

13:13.124 --> 13:14.858
REBECCA:                        
I don't care

13:14.892 --> 13:15.526
why he did it.

13:15.560 --> 13:17.979
The fact is that        
     my earrings are gone,

13:18.013 --> 13:19.646
and the admiral took them.

13:19.681 --> 13:20.581
Oh, come on.

13:20.615 --> 13:21.582
This is silly.

13:21.616 --> 13:23.017
Let's just go          
      in your office here

13:23.051 --> 13:24.018
and look for them.

13:24.052 --> 13:25.086
I have looked for them.

13:25.120 --> 13:26.587
I told you,             
        they're not in there!

13:26.621 --> 13:28.555
I'm calling the police. 
Oh, don't do that.

13:28.590 --> 13:30.240
Well, now that      
            we're through       
            being interrupted,

13:30.275 --> 13:32.025
let's get down to       
        real serious matters.

13:32.060 --> 13:33.811
Carla, you can't
                make blue sparks

13:33.845 --> 13:36.113
come out of your mouth  
        with a Lifesaver.

13:36.148 --> 13:39.650
Well, not just                  
any Lifesaver.

13:39.685 --> 13:42.987
A magic Wint-o-green            
Lifesaver.

13:43.021 --> 13:44.788
Oh, now, Carla, don't prey      
     on their gullibility.

13:44.823 --> 13:46.156
There's nothing magical     
        about it.

13:46.190 --> 13:48.291
It's just a simple              
chemical reaction.

13:48.326 --> 13:49.593
When you crunch down      
        on a Lifesaver,

13:49.628 --> 13:52.162
electrons strike        
      nitrogen molecules,

13:52.197 --> 13:53.664
which causes the latter

13:53.699 --> 13:56.066
to emit an invisible       
     ultraviolet radiation

13:56.100 --> 13:58.168
which, when absorbed      
    by the methyl salicilate

13:58.203 --> 14:01.839
in the Wintergreen flavoring,  
produces a flash of blue light.

14:01.873 --> 14:03.874
Makes sense.

14:05.176 --> 14:06.843
I find that                     
when you say that

14:06.878 --> 14:08.945
to Dr. Crane,                   
he stops talking.

14:13.268 --> 14:14.501
See? They're
                    not here.

14:14.535 --> 14:16.203
I told you,         
            they are no here!

14:16.237 --> 14:18.472
Calm down. Will you             
calm down, please?

14:18.506 --> 14:20.174
I'm calm, I'm calm, I'm calm!

14:20.208 --> 14:21.708
What's the number for 911?

14:21.742 --> 14:23.677
You are not going               
to call the police.

14:23.711 --> 14:26.447
Sam, I have told you    
        to remove your hand     
        from many a location,

14:26.481 --> 14:28.382
but I have          
            never been more     
            serious than now.

14:28.416 --> 14:30.550
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.         
Come on. Back off here.

14:30.585 --> 14:32.987
They're earrings.               
You'll buy another pair.

14:33.021 --> 14:34.188
Oh, yeah. Right!

14:34.222 --> 14:35.990
What are you                    
going to do?

14:36.024 --> 14:37.224
Spot me $32,000?

14:37.258 --> 14:40.177
American money?

14:40.211 --> 14:44.047
I didn't exactly        
      buy those earrings.

14:44.082 --> 14:47.017
I told the man                  
at Shreve, Crump & Lowe

14:47.051 --> 14:47.952
that I just wanted

14:47.986 --> 14:49.670
to take them out        
        for the evening

14:49.704 --> 14:52.273
to make sure that I really,   
      really wanted them.

14:52.307 --> 14:55.475
I don't think that dress    
      is meant to do that.

14:55.510 --> 14:58.396
And then I was going to just

14:58.430 --> 14:59.263
wear them tonight,

14:59.297 --> 15:00.964
and look really                 
beautiful, you know?

15:00.999 --> 15:03.367
Then I was going                
to take them back               
in the morning.

15:03.402 --> 15:06.003
But... God. Shreve  
            is holding all      
            my credit cards,

15:06.037 --> 15:07.421
the pink slip to my Mercedes,

15:07.455 --> 15:09.223
and my mom and dad's      
         phone number.

15:09.257 --> 15:12.292
Uh-oh. Good chance you could  
      be sent to your room

15:12.327 --> 15:14.194
for five to 15 years.

15:14.229 --> 15:15.779
You know,               
you're really not helping.

15:15.813 --> 15:17.013
Just get out of here.

15:18.416 --> 15:19.967
God! I would
                    do anything

15:20.001 --> 15:21.668
to get those    
                earrings back.

15:31.079 --> 15:36.133
Yes, Sam,               
  I am exactly that desperate.

15:37.135 --> 15:38.802
I don't care what it takes.

15:38.836 --> 15:40.771
Go to the admiral's hotel room,

15:40.805 --> 15:42.740
sneak in there         
and steal those earrings.

15:42.774 --> 15:46.543
Just get them back for me and, 
    yes, Lord help me,

15:46.578 --> 15:49.880
I will go to bed with you.

15:49.914 --> 15:53.918
I'm going to turn           
    this joint upside down.

15:53.952 --> 15:55.152
Starting with you.              
                    Sam!

15:55.186 --> 15:56.487
All right,                      
all right, all right.

15:56.521 --> 15:58.121
<i>Ending</i> with you.

16:01.209 --> 16:02.659
I saw it!

16:02.694 --> 16:05.329
Blue sparks         
            in Carla's mouth!

16:05.364 --> 16:07.031
Hey, guys. Listen, fellas.

16:07.065 --> 16:08.832
Am I interrupting anything?

16:08.867 --> 16:11.602
Just science making             
another leap forward.

16:11.636 --> 16:13.604
Fellas, listen. All right,      
    come here. Listen.

16:13.638 --> 16:15.772
Come here. Listen.              
I need your help here now.

16:15.806 --> 16:17.974
I want to get my hands     
      on Rebecca's jewels

16:18.009 --> 16:20.076
but, first, I've got       
     to find her earrings.

16:20.111 --> 16:23.213
All right, Sammy,           
      we're here for you.

16:23.248 --> 16:25.949
All right. Now,                 
I guess we could

16:25.983 --> 16:27.083
buy her another pair,

16:27.118 --> 16:29.419
but that would set us back      
        about 32 grand.

16:29.454 --> 16:31.622
Not here for you, Sam.     
    Left an hour ago.

16:32.823 --> 16:34.291
All right, all right.           
Now, there's got to be...

16:34.325 --> 16:35.759
See, I figure       
            that she probably

16:35.793 --> 16:37.927
just put them down someplace  
        for safekeeping,

16:37.962 --> 16:39.630
and then forgot         
      where she put them.

16:39.664 --> 16:42.432
I got to just find a way to,    
you know, jog her memory.

16:42.467 --> 16:44.334
I... I know                     
what we should do.              
                    What?

16:44.369 --> 16:45.835
I saw this in a movie once.

16:45.870 --> 16:48.938
We gather the suspects     
all together in one room.

16:48.973 --> 16:50.657
Right. And then                 
you recreate the crime

16:50.692 --> 16:53.294
so that you can work backwards  
and find out what happened.

16:53.328 --> 16:54.228
Yeah.                   
                    Let's go.

16:54.262 --> 16:55.262
Hey, Sammy, uh...

16:55.297 --> 16:57.598
since I'm the only one          
here in uniform,

16:57.632 --> 16:59.467
I suggest                       
I play Admiral Crowe.

16:59.501 --> 17:02.002
Well, if you're Admiral Crowe, 
 who's going to be Mr. Clavin?

17:02.036 --> 17:04.037
Aw, any of you yutzes           
can handle that.

17:11.630 --> 17:13.329
( <i>Sam clears his throat</i> )

17:14.214 --> 17:16.467
What are you all doing in here?

17:16.501 --> 17:18.335
Well, Cliff here has agreed

17:18.369 --> 17:20.637
to portray Admiral Crowe    
        so we can

17:20.672 --> 17:23.106
recreate the alleged crime

17:23.140 --> 17:24.907
so we can figure out      
         what happened.

17:24.942 --> 17:26.542
And what about you two guys?

17:26.578 --> 17:28.445
We're witnesses.

17:28.480 --> 17:29.880
Yeah, we're                     
pretty much

17:29.914 --> 17:32.483
just gonna hang                 
around and... and watch.

17:32.517 --> 17:34.818
That's a stretch.

17:36.037 --> 17:37.504
SAM:        
                    Okay, uh...

17:37.538 --> 17:40.841
Admiral Crowe came in      
  and asked to use the phone.

17:40.875 --> 17:42.343
What did he say?

17:42.377 --> 17:44.778
"May I use the phone?"

17:44.812 --> 17:46.997
Excuse me, Rebecca.       
        That's my line.

17:50.952 --> 17:52.553
Then what?

17:52.587 --> 17:55.255
And I said, "Sure,"       
    and he said, "Thank you.

17:55.289 --> 17:58.174
Huh. Look who thinks      
      she's Admiral Crowe.

18:01.963 --> 18:03.764
All right.

18:03.798 --> 18:06.099
Now, he came in here,      
         he was alone.

18:06.134 --> 18:07.768
Was he              
            carrying anything?

18:07.802 --> 18:10.437
Uh... I think he was carrying  
    a glass of water.

18:10.472 --> 18:11.938
I see.

18:11.973 --> 18:14.441
And did he put this 
            glass of water down?

18:14.476 --> 18:15.942
I think so.

18:15.977 --> 18:20.181
Next to, perhaps,   
            this glass?

18:20.215 --> 18:21.348
Ooh!

18:22.750 --> 18:24.417
I see what you're               
getting at, Sam.

18:24.452 --> 18:26.519
You think that                  
he picked up                    
the other glass

18:26.554 --> 18:28.555
with the earrings               
in it and took it out.

18:28.589 --> 18:31.325
Yeah, right. Absolutely.

18:31.359 --> 18:34.061
Guys, we're out of here.

18:36.197 --> 18:38.498
Hey, I didn't   
                get to portray  
                Admiral Crowe.

18:38.532 --> 18:40.000
Uh... all right. Uh...

18:40.034 --> 18:41.485
Rebecca,                        
as a favor for Cliff,

18:41.519 --> 18:43.887
what was the last words         
the Admiral said? Anything?

18:43.921 --> 18:45.756
Yes. Before he left, he said,

18:45.790 --> 18:48.759
"I want to get out of this bar 
        as fast as I can

18:48.793 --> 18:51.328
before I run into           
     that stupid mailman."

18:51.362 --> 18:54.248
He stole them,  
                all right.

18:54.282 --> 18:55.548
Wait.

18:55.583 --> 18:56.633
You were supposed

18:56.668 --> 18:58.268
to help me find my earrings.  
            Come on!

18:58.302 --> 19:00.403
Yeah. Look what I found         
in this dirty old glass.

19:00.438 --> 19:03.006
Oh! Oh!

19:03.040 --> 19:06.242
Oh! You are     
                such an angel!

19:06.277 --> 19:08.712
Oh, how can         
            I ever thank you?

19:10.131 --> 19:13.133
I think the how has             
already been established.

19:16.037 --> 19:20.423
We're up to where               
and how often.

19:23.644 --> 19:28.848
Well... a promise is a promise.

19:28.883 --> 19:31.251
Come on. I hate that.

19:31.286 --> 19:32.819
I hate it                       
when you do that.

19:32.854 --> 19:35.289
Come on. What...                
what's wrong with you?

19:35.323 --> 19:37.057
Why... why                      
don't you want me?

19:37.091 --> 19:38.392
What's the problem?

19:38.426 --> 19:39.560
You know, Sam, I really...

19:39.594 --> 19:41.462
I just don't know           
     why I don't want you.

19:41.496 --> 19:43.363
Well, think,                    
damn it!

19:46.668 --> 19:48.802
I think it's just one      
     of those things that,

19:48.837 --> 19:50.136
when you first meet a guy,

19:50.171 --> 19:53.173
you put him in one of three   
 categories-- yes, no or maybe.

19:53.207 --> 19:54.741
From the second 
                I saw you,

19:54.776 --> 19:56.710
I threw you right           
     in that "no" category,

19:56.745 --> 19:58.979
and that's where        
you've stayed ever since.

19:59.013 --> 20:01.315
I mean, when    
                Sam Malone walks
                into a room,

20:01.349 --> 20:04.050
I say "no" and go on      
         with my life.

20:04.084 --> 20:06.586
Every single time?

20:06.621 --> 20:08.239
No. There was this one time,

20:08.273 --> 20:10.907
when you were way down      
    at the end of the hall,

20:10.942 --> 20:14.345
and I could just see this tiny 
  little piece of your elbow,

20:14.379 --> 20:16.747
and I didn't know for sure      
         if it was you.

20:16.781 --> 20:20.100
And I thought   
                to myself, hmm.

20:20.134 --> 20:21.668
And then you came           
    around the corner,

20:21.702 --> 20:23.870
and I thought, "God, no!"

20:25.440 --> 20:30.477
"God, no" is a lot worse    
    than just no, isn't it?

20:30.512 --> 20:32.846
Sam, wait. I want       
        to ask you something.

20:32.880 --> 20:35.449
And I want an answer to this.

20:35.483 --> 20:37.017
Why do you care?

20:38.186 --> 20:39.502
Why do you want me?

20:39.537 --> 20:41.304
I... I have never           
     given you any reason.

20:41.338 --> 20:42.539
I've never come on to you.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.007
Why do you keep hitting on me?

20:46.310 --> 20:49.530
Uh... I don't know. I...

20:49.564 --> 20:52.699
I guess that I...           
    when I meet women,

20:52.733 --> 20:56.270
I put them into one       
      of three categories.

20:56.304 --> 20:58.121
Oh, who am I kidding?

20:58.155 --> 21:00.857
I put them into one category.

21:02.710 --> 21:04.761
Boy, I guess          
      I shouldn't do that.

21:04.796 --> 21:07.464
I mean, that's         
    not really fair to you.

21:07.498 --> 21:09.365
I'm sorry.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.218
Thank you, Sam.

21:12.520 --> 21:14.554
I know that wasn't easy     
        for you to say.

21:14.589 --> 21:16.773
I haven't been

21:16.808 --> 21:18.058
real fair myself.

21:18.092 --> 21:20.960
I mean, I haven't           
really given you a chance.

21:20.995 --> 21:22.545
Don't worry about it.

21:22.580 --> 21:25.281
I mean...               
Gee, I wish we could just

21:25.316 --> 21:27.451
start all over                  
again, you know?

21:27.485 --> 21:30.421
Just wipe all this              
junk out of the way.

21:30.455 --> 21:32.423
I like that idea.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.991
Yeah, I mean, it's,             
like, if I could

21:35.026 --> 21:36.927
see you for                     
the first time,

21:36.961 --> 21:39.095
I'd look over there             
and I'd...

21:39.130 --> 21:41.398
well, I'd see                   
a beautiful woman.

21:41.433 --> 21:43.167
Thank you.

21:43.201 --> 21:47.470
And I'd see you, and I'd see  
    a real good-looking guy.

21:47.505 --> 21:50.573
With... with nice hair.

21:50.608 --> 21:53.760
Right.

21:53.794 --> 21:55.529
Say it.

21:58.366 --> 21:59.832
With nice hair.

21:59.867 --> 22:00.934
Thank you.

22:00.968 --> 22:02.135
And broad shoulders and...

22:03.204 --> 22:04.637
a pleasant smile.

22:05.906 --> 22:08.024
Nice hair again.

22:08.059 --> 22:10.160
Aw, see, you're...

22:10.194 --> 22:11.528
you're patronizing me.

22:11.562 --> 22:14.097
No, I'm not. I am   
            not patronizing you.

22:14.132 --> 22:15.799
We said we were going      
         to be honest.

22:15.833 --> 22:17.433
I think you're         
    an attractive guy.

22:17.468 --> 22:19.936
I think you're      
            cute enough to kiss.

22:19.971 --> 22:21.621
I mean, if I didn't know you.

22:21.656 --> 22:22.956
Yeah, yeah...                   
if you didn't know me.

22:22.990 --> 22:23.924
All right, what?

22:23.958 --> 22:25.692
You want me to  
                prove it to you

22:25.726 --> 22:27.193
that I think
                    you're cute?

22:27.227 --> 22:28.194
All right, fine.

22:28.228 --> 22:29.629
I will prove it to you.

22:29.664 --> 22:32.632
I will dispel the myth     
that you turn my stomach.

22:32.667 --> 22:34.568
I will give you a little kiss.

22:35.703 --> 22:36.720
Here.

22:37.722 --> 22:38.722
There.

22:49.367 --> 22:51.868
Now, what category              
am I in?

22:52.870 --> 22:54.971
Yes?

22:55.005 --> 22:56.573
No?

22:56.608 --> 22:58.842
Oh, geez.

22:58.876 --> 23:02.212
Why do I even                   
bother with you?

23:03.197 --> 23:06.683
Ooh! A definite maybe.

23:06.717 --> 23:08.651
I heard that.

23:09.787 --> 23:10.887
You said maybe!

23:11.472 --> 23:12.105
You said maybe!

23:12.139 --> 23:14.858
Rebecca thinks I'm a maybe!

23:14.892 --> 23:16.209
I did not say that!

23:16.243 --> 23:17.744
I said that you kiss      
      like my Uncle Abey!

23:17.778 --> 23:19.462
No, no, no.

23:19.497 --> 23:22.515
I said that I think       
      you gave me rabies!
