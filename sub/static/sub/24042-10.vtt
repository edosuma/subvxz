WEBVTT

00:00.280 --> 00:01.931
<i>Previously on "For the People"...</i>

00:01.966 --> 00:04.188
Your client tried to blow up the
Statue of Liberty, Sandra Bell.

00:04.213 --> 00:07.852
We the jury find the
defendant, Mohammed Fayed, guilty.

00:07.886 --> 00:09.086
You could be a good lawyer.

00:09.121 --> 00:11.088
If you tried. You're just not trying.

00:11.123 --> 00:13.257
My tradition is now to eat with you

00:13.292 --> 00:15.426
every night before
the first day of trial.

00:15.461 --> 00:17.228
Can I get your number?

00:17.263 --> 00:19.096
I like you.

00:19.131 --> 00:20.560
This could never work.

00:20.595 --> 00:23.166
We'd be lying in bed,
and I'd be infuriated.

00:23.202 --> 00:24.400
My takeaway from that is that

00:24.436 --> 00:26.168
you've thought about us lying in bed.

00:26.204 --> 00:28.170
How is it that your first time on duty,

00:28.206 --> 00:29.239
you get him?

00:29.274 --> 00:31.374
I'd like for you to come by
my office this afternoon

00:31.409 --> 00:32.442
so we can discuss some things.

00:32.476 --> 00:34.277
- It's a date.
- It's not a date.

00:34.312 --> 00:36.246
- Do you miss him?
- Sometimes.

00:36.281 --> 00:38.348
This is the United States District Court

00:38.383 --> 00:40.250
for the Southern District of New York.

00:40.285 --> 00:41.608
Are you worthy?

00:44.655 --> 00:46.221
Do you hate me?

00:47.190 --> 00:48.089
Why would I hate you?

00:48.125 --> 00:49.864
It wasn't that bad. I mean, it wasn't...

00:49.899 --> 00:51.126
No, not that.

00:51.161 --> 00:53.629
I mean, you said we'd end up
in bed next to each other

00:53.664 --> 00:54.630
with you hating me.

00:54.665 --> 00:56.197
Oh, yeah, right.

00:56.233 --> 00:58.332
Well, yes. Give it time.

00:58.368 --> 01:00.801
But for right now...

01:00.836 --> 01:01.769
it's fun.

01:38.071 --> 01:40.172
Have you been working here all night?

01:40.207 --> 01:42.974
I was in the kitchen from 2:15 to 3:00.

01:43.010 --> 01:45.010
I think I broke the toaster.

01:45.045 --> 01:47.212
Did you finish?

01:47.247 --> 01:48.347
Yes.

01:48.382 --> 01:49.429
How do you feel?

01:49.464 --> 01:51.349
I feel like I shouldn't have
lost the trial

01:51.384 --> 01:52.650
in the first place.

02:14.606 --> 02:16.072
I'm thinking about getting a unicycle.

02:16.107 --> 02:17.228
- No.
- I am.

02:17.264 --> 02:19.075
But this was going so well, you and me.

02:19.110 --> 02:20.276
I think it'd be cool.

02:20.312 --> 02:22.379
You are mistaken.

02:22.414 --> 02:23.612
You really do that every morning?

02:23.648 --> 02:24.680
Every morning.

02:24.716 --> 02:27.416
She walks across the
Brooklyn Bridge every morning.

02:27.452 --> 02:29.981
- And back. What are you doing here?
- Me?

02:30.016 --> 02:32.287
You're not just loitering around
the clerk's desk, are you?

02:32.323 --> 02:33.328
No.

02:33.333 --> 02:34.541
Because you know I wouldn't like that.

02:34.566 --> 02:36.425
'Course I know that.
What's to like about that?

02:36.461 --> 02:37.593
What are you doing here?

02:37.628 --> 02:41.596
I am here because I am on duty.

02:41.631 --> 02:42.630
Really?

02:42.666 --> 02:43.608
Uh-huh.

02:43.644 --> 02:44.466
Duty?

02:44.501 --> 02:45.565
Yep.

02:46.436 --> 02:47.435
Okay.

02:49.406 --> 02:50.438
Here's your case.

02:50.474 --> 02:51.939
Cool. No problem.

02:51.975 --> 02:52.999
Shouldn't be if you're on duty.

02:53.034 --> 02:56.444
And it isn't. Because I <i> am</i> on duty.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.245
No problem.

03:01.484 --> 03:03.283
Huge problem! I can't do this.

03:03.318 --> 03:04.284
Where did you get this?

03:04.319 --> 03:06.319
- I picked it up on duty.
- You're not on duty.

03:06.355 --> 03:08.288
You know, this is a great point.
I like this point.

03:08.323 --> 03:09.857
Oh, so smart, Sandra.

03:11.627 --> 03:13.093
Eh, see, I like that less.

03:13.128 --> 03:15.127
What is the problem?

03:15.162 --> 03:16.171
Ohhh.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.797
- Ohh.
- Oh.

03:17.832 --> 03:18.964
Kate Littlejohn.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.065
You'll be fine.

03:20.101 --> 03:21.601
No. I will not be fine.

03:21.636 --> 03:25.337
Do you realize I have an actual fear
of fluorescent colors because of her?

03:25.373 --> 03:26.572
Because of the tabs!

03:26.608 --> 03:28.307
A clinically verifiable phobia.

03:28.342 --> 03:31.277
I have been treated
for this... unsuccessfully!

03:31.312 --> 03:32.677
- Brainbridge.
- What?

03:32.713 --> 03:34.178
Oh, sorry... Bainbridge.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.732
I keep mixing that up.

03:35.767 --> 03:38.316
Bank robbery. Government's gonna
offer a favorable deal.

03:38.351 --> 03:42.320
Alice Huang. Staff hydrologist
with the U.S. Geological Survey.

03:42.355 --> 03:44.186
She's being charged with downloading

03:44.211 --> 03:46.425
and transmitting sensitive
scientific data

03:46.460 --> 03:49.126
about water distribution systems
to the Chinese.

03:49.161 --> 03:50.213
You okay?

03:51.230 --> 03:52.430
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

03:52.465 --> 03:54.197
She was up all night on the Fayed appeal.

03:54.233 --> 03:55.533
I slept, like, 11 hours last night.

03:55.568 --> 03:56.703
I can totally switch.

03:56.738 --> 03:58.702
It's okay. I'm okay. I got it.

03:58.738 --> 04:02.272
Okay, well, good morning, everyone!

04:02.308 --> 04:04.508
Let's make this a great day.

04:07.679 --> 04:09.145
This is one of those mornings
where I wonder

04:09.180 --> 04:10.680
what it's like across the street.

04:10.715 --> 04:12.114
Grim and quiet,

04:12.150 --> 04:14.183
plotting death and destruction all day.

04:14.218 --> 04:15.284
Good morning, everyone!

04:15.320 --> 04:16.519
How was everyone's morning?

04:16.555 --> 04:17.478
Littlejohn?

04:17.514 --> 04:18.855
My morning was great, sir.

04:18.890 --> 04:19.988
I am glad to hear it.

04:20.024 --> 04:21.023
Mine too.

04:21.059 --> 04:22.028
Excellent.

04:22.063 --> 04:23.549
I would say excellent, as well.

04:23.584 --> 04:25.794
- And I would say, for me...
- Okay. Let's get started.

04:25.830 --> 04:28.564
Mr. Oliver, this is a case
I was gonna give to Mr. Knox,

04:28.599 --> 04:29.898
but I knew he would complain about it,

04:29.934 --> 04:32.734
and I knew you'd smile and say,
"I appreciate the opportunity,"

04:32.770 --> 04:34.402
and then mumble something
under your breath about me.

04:34.438 --> 04:36.538
No, sir. I do appreciate the opportunity.

04:36.574 --> 04:37.637
Always giving me the worst...

04:37.673 --> 04:39.740
Broti. Your wine informant has gone AWOL.

04:39.776 --> 04:40.775
This is a problem.

04:40.810 --> 04:43.878
Ms. Littlejohn,
a parent at The Whitley School

04:43.913 --> 04:46.046
has apparently been found
with MDMA in her car.

04:46.082 --> 04:47.117
This is now your problem.

04:47.152 --> 04:49.049
Since when is this a federal prosecution?

04:49.085 --> 04:51.385
Since two other parents at the
school called their good friend

04:51.420 --> 04:52.408
the United States Attorney

04:52.433 --> 04:54.421
for the Southern District
of New York Douglas Delap

04:54.457 --> 04:56.090
and asked his office to handle it.

04:56.125 --> 04:57.390
And I want you to keep those parents

04:57.425 --> 04:58.492
up to speed on this case.

04:58.527 --> 05:02.829
Speaking of parents,
Mr. Knox, your mom is in town.

05:02.865 --> 05:04.879
I know this because you
tried to put lunch

05:04.904 --> 05:06.566
for the three of us on my calendar,

05:06.602 --> 05:08.067
and I took this off my calendar.

05:08.103 --> 05:10.770
And in case anybody is not yet aware,

05:10.806 --> 05:11.934
Leonard Knox's mom

05:11.959 --> 05:13.572
is a United States Senator!

05:13.608 --> 05:18.410
And, finally, Ms. Chavez,
you are up against Sandra Bell.

05:18.445 --> 05:19.748
Some of the other attorneys here

05:19.783 --> 05:21.881
will have negative things
to say about that,

05:21.916 --> 05:24.517
but I am not a negative person,
and I encourage everybody else

05:24.552 --> 05:27.419
to be kind and respectful
to our adversaries.

05:27.454 --> 05:30.989
Thank you all. It's been a great pleasure
spending time with you this morning.

05:33.627 --> 05:35.126
Sandra Bell is a total pain in the ass.

05:35.161 --> 05:37.562
- Sandra Bell is sanctimonious...
- Crush Sandra Bell.

05:37.597 --> 05:39.531
I'm not a spy, Ms. Bell.

05:39.566 --> 05:42.534
Why don't you tell me
about Mr. Hua Lin...

05:42.569 --> 05:43.768
how you were first introduced?

05:45.304 --> 05:46.704
In the summer of 2015,

05:46.740 --> 05:49.139
I was visiting my parents in Beijing.

05:49.174 --> 05:52.543
My former professor introduced
me to Hua Lin at a party.

05:52.578 --> 05:55.445
We talked about fluid mechanics,

05:55.480 --> 05:59.583
streamflow response...
things we both care about...

05:59.618 --> 06:01.618
and from there, it grew.

06:01.654 --> 06:02.762
Personal.

06:04.822 --> 06:07.289
I visited him three times in Beijing

06:07.324 --> 06:09.091
over a two-year period.

06:09.126 --> 06:12.828
I visited his office at
the Ministry of Water Resources.

06:12.864 --> 06:15.798
We stayed together in a hotel.

06:15.833 --> 06:19.268
That's where I gave him
two flash drives full of data.

06:19.303 --> 06:21.736
Which I did not have access to.

06:21.772 --> 06:23.939
Lin didn't ask me for any of this.

06:23.974 --> 06:25.607
I offered it.

06:25.642 --> 06:29.343
Because we were scientists
trying to solve a problem.

06:29.379 --> 06:31.082
That was the real reason.

06:31.615 --> 06:37.018
But the personal side,
it just complicated everything.

06:37.054 --> 06:39.587
And by the time the FBI
showed up at my desk,

06:39.622 --> 06:43.624
I had deleted so many e-mails,
lied about so many things...

06:43.659 --> 06:45.764
I-I couldn't tell the truth.

06:47.029 --> 06:48.600
We are both married.

06:49.498 --> 06:51.065
And we both have children.

06:54.036 --> 06:56.502
I know how it looks.

06:56.537 --> 06:58.568
How it always looks.

06:59.407 --> 07:01.808
Whenever I spoke Chinese
on the phone at work,

07:01.843 --> 07:03.810
with a family member,

07:03.845 --> 07:06.117
people would make these comments.

07:06.815 --> 07:08.180
What about?

07:08.216 --> 07:10.549
Wen Ho Lee. Chi Mak. Greg Chung.

07:10.585 --> 07:12.718
People made jokes about
Chinese-American scientists

07:12.753 --> 07:14.352
who had been accused of espionage?

07:14.387 --> 07:15.721
I just let it pass.

07:15.756 --> 07:17.379
We do that.

07:18.358 --> 07:20.826
But... now I'm here.

07:23.363 --> 07:25.530
The courthouse where I was arraigned...

07:25.565 --> 07:28.139
that's where I became a citizen.

07:29.202 --> 07:31.335
I love my new country, Ms. Bell.

07:31.370 --> 07:33.738
My children are Americans.

07:33.773 --> 07:35.272
I've built my life here.

07:37.276 --> 07:39.010
Can you help me?

07:43.282 --> 07:50.316
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

07:57.485 --> 07:59.788
Good to hear from you. How's it going?

07:59.813 --> 08:01.211
You know, working a lot.

08:01.247 --> 08:03.380
Tried oysters for the first time.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.115
Don't totally understand what I'm eating.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.217
Is that the body?

08:07.253 --> 08:08.218
The head?

08:08.254 --> 08:11.121
W-What is this little lump exactly?

08:11.157 --> 08:13.290
I just... don't think about it.

08:13.325 --> 08:14.625
I had this friend in high school,

08:14.661 --> 08:16.060
he wouldn't eat anything with eyes.

08:16.095 --> 08:19.517
So, a lot of scallops, clams, oysters.

08:19.552 --> 08:20.564
Potatoes?

08:20.599 --> 08:21.598
Yes.

08:21.633 --> 08:23.033
That's a good point.

08:25.170 --> 08:27.103
You wanted to...

08:27.138 --> 08:28.616
tell me something?

08:29.140 --> 08:30.807
Really, I wanted to have coffee with you.

08:30.842 --> 08:31.867
But yes.

08:31.903 --> 08:35.077
Your wine forger client? Toby Mahler?

08:35.111 --> 08:36.330
He missed a tasting with the FBI.

08:36.365 --> 08:38.179
They're getting a warrant.
You didn't hear it from me.

08:38.215 --> 08:39.214
Thank you.

08:39.249 --> 08:41.416
For real, though, please
don't use this against me.

08:41.452 --> 08:42.684
I would never.

08:42.720 --> 08:43.919
Again.

08:46.156 --> 08:49.124
All right. I got to go deal with Toby.

08:49.159 --> 08:50.430
Thank you.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.259
For all of this.

08:56.733 --> 08:58.332
Oysters are amazing.

08:58.367 --> 09:00.301
You clearly had the wrong ones.

09:00.336 --> 09:02.025
I'll take you somewhere good.

09:02.973 --> 09:04.194
You'll see.

09:08.744 --> 09:10.844
I know all your clients
probably say this,

09:10.879 --> 09:13.847
but I have no idea how those
things ended up inside my car.

09:13.882 --> 09:16.116
You'd actually be surprised
how many <i> don't</i> say that.

09:16.151 --> 09:17.350
I've never even <i>tried</i> drugs.

09:17.385 --> 09:19.452
I feel like I'm living in some sort of

09:19.488 --> 09:21.822
horrible alternative universe.

09:21.857 --> 09:22.889
I can't sleep.

09:22.925 --> 09:25.225
I'm trying not to let my son
see how terrified I am,

09:25.260 --> 09:26.726
because if something happened to me...

09:26.761 --> 09:28.060
If you plead guilty,

09:28.096 --> 09:29.361
I can probably get you probation.

09:29.396 --> 09:30.796
No jail time.

09:30.832 --> 09:32.064
But that would mean pleading guilty,

09:32.100 --> 09:33.298
and if you insist that you're not...

09:33.334 --> 09:35.067
What about William?

09:35.103 --> 09:36.168
His scholarship?

09:37.371 --> 09:39.672
It's hard for me to imagine
that he'd stay at the school.

09:42.043 --> 09:44.809
Do you know who called the police?

09:44.845 --> 09:46.344
Told them to search my car?

09:46.379 --> 09:47.979
It was an anonymous tip.

09:48.015 --> 09:50.581
This sounds crazy, but...

09:50.617 --> 09:53.351
there's a mother at the school...

09:53.386 --> 09:55.086
a lawyer.

09:55.122 --> 09:56.387
Dana Gallagher.

09:56.422 --> 09:57.989
And I ran against her this year

09:58.025 --> 09:59.723
to be head of the Parents' Association.

09:59.759 --> 10:00.829
I won.

10:00.865 --> 10:02.726
She and her husband have three kids

10:02.762 --> 10:04.828
that go to The Whitley School.

10:04.864 --> 10:08.231
And they never liked me.
I don't know why.

10:08.267 --> 10:10.333
Maybe if you're paying tuition
for three kids,

10:10.369 --> 10:13.270
you're bound to hate the person
whose kid goes for free.

10:13.305 --> 10:16.706
William worked so hard
for that scholarship.

10:16.741 --> 10:20.309
At his old school,
there were these kids that...

10:22.480 --> 10:24.816
He had a rough time.

10:25.216 --> 10:27.449
How do I tell him
he has to go back there?

10:27.485 --> 10:29.952
Let's take it one step at a time, okay?

10:29.988 --> 10:31.754
Maybe you won't have to.

10:32.407 --> 10:34.956
Webb Flynt is stepping down
as Solicitor General?

10:34.992 --> 10:36.224
I thought he'd die in that chair,

10:36.259 --> 10:39.695
but apparently he wants to fish
and play with his grandchildren.

10:39.730 --> 10:41.763
- Whatever.
- So, what's the word?

10:41.799 --> 10:43.799
Who's the AG looking at as a replacement?

10:43.834 --> 10:45.233
Me.

10:45.268 --> 10:46.467
You're not leaving the Senate.

10:46.503 --> 10:47.936
He's looking at me for names.

10:47.971 --> 10:49.971
And I only gave him one...

10:50.007 --> 10:51.105
you.

10:51.140 --> 10:52.472
Me?

10:52.508 --> 10:53.908
Yes.

10:53.943 --> 10:55.409
Solicitor General of Texas?

10:55.444 --> 10:57.311
- Yes.
- That's in Texas.

10:57.346 --> 11:00.480
Well, at least we know you'll
be able to find your office.

11:00.516 --> 11:02.817
Is it too soon? I just
got to the Southern District.

11:02.852 --> 11:04.919
Barack Obama had just
gotten into the U.S. Senate

11:04.954 --> 11:06.420
when he ran for President.

11:06.455 --> 11:07.821
Opportunity is opportunity.

11:07.856 --> 11:10.256
- This...
- Is an opportunity.

11:10.291 --> 11:13.259
You did your time in New York.
You come home to Texas.

11:13.294 --> 11:15.829
Accept the Attorney General's
appointment as Solicitor.

11:15.864 --> 11:17.731
You do the job we both know you can do.

11:17.766 --> 11:19.432
Then you use it to launch yourself

11:19.467 --> 11:21.400
into the United States Senate.

11:21.436 --> 11:24.104
I'm really settling in at this office.

11:24.139 --> 11:26.939
Some of the people I work with,
we're starting to click.

11:26.974 --> 11:28.182
I'm sure they'll forgive you

11:28.218 --> 11:29.975
when you invite them to the White House.

11:30.010 --> 11:31.476
Because that's where you're headed.

11:32.646 --> 11:34.346
This job is mine if I want it?

11:35.883 --> 11:37.555
That's the question...

11:38.219 --> 11:39.618
do you want it?

11:42.055 --> 11:43.454
Do you want it?

11:47.827 --> 11:49.359
You look kind of...

11:50.163 --> 11:51.996
- I'm fine.
- Oh?

11:53.933 --> 11:56.167
Well, obviously,
selling drugs to children

11:56.202 --> 11:57.635
is an abhorrent offense,

11:57.670 --> 12:00.036
but the good news is,
we're willing to negotiate.

12:00.072 --> 12:03.306
Now, given the amount of MDMA that
was found in the defendant's car

12:03.341 --> 12:05.142
and factoring in
her intent to distribute...

12:05.177 --> 12:07.377
Nancy Martin's not a drug dealer.

12:07.412 --> 12:10.013
Really? Just like
Adam Dyle wasn't a scam artist?

12:10.048 --> 12:11.714
- It's not the same.
- Well,<i> you're</i> the same.

12:11.750 --> 12:14.251
Still willing to believe
whatever your client says...

12:14.286 --> 12:16.018
willfully ignoring the evidence.

12:16.053 --> 12:18.320
Look, that evidence
could have been planted.

12:18.355 --> 12:19.655
Nancy's fingerprints weren't on it,

12:19.690 --> 12:20.890
she left her car unlocked...

12:20.925 --> 12:22.424
The principal of The Whitley School

12:22.459 --> 12:24.693
confirmed there were already
numerous rumors going around

12:24.728 --> 12:25.928
that Nancy sold drugs.

12:25.963 --> 12:27.004
Rumors? Mm.

12:27.040 --> 12:29.564
An anonymous phone call...

12:29.600 --> 12:30.732
Is that a Lego brick?

12:33.636 --> 12:35.837
I have a statement here
from two parents at the school,

12:35.872 --> 12:37.371
Michael and Dana Gallagher.

12:37.407 --> 12:39.373
They're both attorneys,
and they will testify

12:39.409 --> 12:41.509
- that Ms. Martin has had a...
- Wait. Stop.

12:41.544 --> 12:44.445
The Gallaghers are driving this?

12:44.480 --> 12:46.214
Nobody drives our prosecutions.

12:46.249 --> 12:47.548
Oh, yeah. Right.

12:47.583 --> 12:49.250
The Gallaghers hate Nancy Martin.

12:49.286 --> 12:51.518
She beat out Dana for the head
of the Parents' Association,

12:51.553 --> 12:53.954
and what's worse, she's poor.

12:53.989 --> 12:55.740
I think they're playing <i> you.</i>

12:55.775 --> 12:58.425
I think you're the one
who's being Adam Dyled here,

12:58.460 --> 13:00.527
Kate Littlejohn.

13:00.562 --> 13:02.595
I think that's it for today, Mr. Simmons.

13:02.631 --> 13:05.132
Why don't you call me when
you're ready to be reasonable.

13:19.778 --> 13:21.239
Thank you for having us in.

13:21.240 --> 13:22.572
Roger says you're one of the good ones.

13:22.608 --> 13:23.802
We are so relieved to hear

13:23.838 --> 13:25.709
the government's
taking this case seriously.

13:25.744 --> 13:28.177
Oh, we take every case
seriously, Ms. Gallagher.

13:28.213 --> 13:30.680
Now, I am sorry that I don't
have more to report right now,

13:30.716 --> 13:33.116
but my hope is we can
have a deal in place by...

13:33.151 --> 13:34.784
I'm sorry, a deal?

13:34.819 --> 13:37.185
A deal with jail time.

13:37.221 --> 13:38.954
This is Ms. Martin's first offense.

13:38.989 --> 13:40.422
You know I'm a litigator, right?

13:40.458 --> 13:42.524
So was Dana before the kids.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.192
We know what an excuse sounds like.

13:44.228 --> 13:45.894
It's not an excuse. It's a simple...

13:45.929 --> 13:47.195
Maybe we should call Doug.

13:47.231 --> 13:48.364
You don't need to call Mr. Delap.

13:48.399 --> 13:50.566
This woman is ruining our school.

13:50.601 --> 13:52.200
Okay? Do you understand?

13:52.236 --> 13:54.435
So you can sit there
and defend her or you...

13:54.471 --> 13:55.490
I'm not defending her. In fact, I'm...

13:55.525 --> 13:58.773
Listen to me,
you twenty-something-haircut.

13:58.808 --> 14:01.041
Nancy Martin needs to go to jail.

14:01.077 --> 14:02.644
Okay? She's been fooling everyone

14:02.679 --> 14:04.445
with her "I'm such a good person" act

14:04.481 --> 14:06.614
and trying to shame
the rest of us into giving up

14:06.650 --> 14:09.750
the Foundations of
Western Civilization curriculum

14:09.785 --> 14:11.137
or trying to set a limit on how much

14:11.162 --> 14:12.753
the kids can spend on their prom night...

14:12.788 --> 14:14.821
it's prom, for God's sake...

14:14.856 --> 14:16.556
when she should just shut up
and be grateful

14:16.592 --> 14:18.659
her kid's even at the school
in the first place.

14:18.694 --> 14:20.226
And now this?

14:20.262 --> 14:22.429
Selling drugs?

14:22.464 --> 14:24.598
I want that woman locked up.

14:28.670 --> 14:30.303
I really don't like those people.

14:30.338 --> 14:31.937
Lucas and Amy?

14:31.972 --> 14:34.573
- He does do that thing with his nose...
- The parents who brought this case in.

14:34.609 --> 14:36.409
- She called me a "haircut."
- I don't know what that means.

14:36.444 --> 14:38.577
- Should I talk to Roger?
- I doubt he knows. He's such a...

14:38.613 --> 14:40.746
Should I talk to Roger
about how awful they are?

14:40.782 --> 14:41.913
Dana Gallagher used to work here.

14:41.938 --> 14:42.996
I wouldn't.

14:43.031 --> 14:44.683
I need some help.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.618
Remember that first day here,
when I told you

14:46.653 --> 14:47.786
I didn't want to be the help desk

14:47.821 --> 14:49.521
for every man in this office?

14:49.556 --> 14:51.456
That was so long ago!

14:51.491 --> 14:52.691
Okay, so, here's the thing.

14:52.726 --> 14:54.125
I think I have feelings for this girl...

14:54.160 --> 14:55.193
- Allison.
- Doesn't matter.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.294
And I want to tell this girl...

14:56.330 --> 14:57.696
- Allison.
- How I feel.

14:57.731 --> 14:59.096
How do you feel about Allison?

14:59.132 --> 15:00.298
Not sure.

15:00.333 --> 15:03.667
I mean, I loved her. Then I didn't.

15:03.703 --> 15:07.504
But now, seeing her,
it's different, and I just...

15:07.540 --> 15:08.639
I don't know.

15:08.674 --> 15:10.207
Seems like a sweet thing to say.

15:10.242 --> 15:11.642
- Well, I mean, I'm confused...
- Yes. Look.

15:11.677 --> 15:13.444
If you have feelings,
I think you should tell her.

15:13.479 --> 15:15.446
I'm a big believer in being honest.

15:15.481 --> 15:16.732
For example...

15:17.515 --> 15:18.981
I would like you to leave now.

15:20.585 --> 15:22.414
Well, this was great.

15:22.450 --> 15:23.653
Thank you.

15:31.830 --> 15:33.128
Hey.

15:33.164 --> 15:34.096
Hey?

15:37.033 --> 15:39.334
Where have you been?

15:39.370 --> 15:41.370
Flavigny-sur-Ozerain.

15:41.405 --> 15:42.971
What?

15:43.006 --> 15:44.506
It's in France.

15:44.541 --> 15:45.574
Please tell me you're joking.

15:45.609 --> 15:48.139
For real. It's a village
in Burgundy. Check the map.

15:48.846 --> 15:50.879
Toby, you can't leave the country!

15:50.914 --> 15:52.205
That's part of the deal.

15:52.241 --> 15:55.649
I was meeting with producers,
tasting new vintages.

15:55.685 --> 15:57.585
I can't help the FBI track down forgers

15:57.620 --> 15:59.420
if I'm not experiencing the latest wines.

15:59.455 --> 16:00.645
Is this about the meeting
I missed on Monday?

16:00.680 --> 16:02.656
Yes. And I will prepare
a statement, but...

16:02.692 --> 16:04.568
No, I think Gerald already
called over to that Broti

16:04.604 --> 16:05.576
or whatever her name is.

16:05.611 --> 16:07.828
- Who is Gerald?
- He's my lawyer.

16:07.864 --> 16:08.862
<i>I'm</i> your lawyer.

16:08.897 --> 16:10.497
You <i> were</i> my lawyer.

16:10.532 --> 16:13.500
But now that I can afford
a lawyer, I <i> have</i> a lawyer.

16:13.535 --> 16:14.667
- Wine?
- What?

16:14.703 --> 16:16.235
To celebrate.

16:16.271 --> 16:17.604
No. No wine.

16:17.639 --> 16:19.038
- It's not fake.
- That's not the point.

16:19.073 --> 16:20.130
You said you couldn't go out

16:20.155 --> 16:21.923
on a date with me because
I was your client.

16:22.644 --> 16:24.411
Now I'm not your client.

16:24.446 --> 16:25.778
So there's no reason
we can't see each other.

16:25.813 --> 16:27.446
There are other reasons.

16:27.481 --> 16:28.554
Such as?

16:31.485 --> 16:33.552
Look, if the answer's no,
I'll respect that,

16:33.587 --> 16:35.645
and you'll never hear from me ever again.

16:36.256 --> 16:38.397
But before you make up
your mind, just know...

16:39.092 --> 16:40.441
I like you.

16:41.228 --> 16:42.593
A lot.

16:42.629 --> 16:46.697
You're smart and charming,
interesting, beautiful.

16:46.733 --> 16:48.566
I like being around you.

16:48.601 --> 16:51.202
So, now that you're not my lawyer...

16:52.639 --> 16:54.622
will you at least consider it?

16:58.478 --> 16:59.743
And you said?

16:59.778 --> 17:01.210
I don't know. Something ridiculous.

17:01.246 --> 17:02.278
Because he's ridiculous.

17:02.314 --> 17:03.279
Ly hot.

17:03.315 --> 17:05.174
But I am enjoying Seth.

17:05.818 --> 17:06.847
What is happening here?

17:06.883 --> 17:09.419
- Oh, a cone of depression.
- What's that?

17:09.454 --> 17:11.220
It's a conical shape produced
in a piezometric surface

17:11.256 --> 17:13.222
by the extraction of water
from a well at a given rate.

17:13.258 --> 17:15.791
It's also the place defense lawyers go

17:15.828 --> 17:17.291
when they're about to lose a case.

17:17.328 --> 17:18.794
Don't say that.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.829
I don't think Alice Huang is a spy.

17:20.865 --> 17:21.830
I truly don't.

17:21.866 --> 17:24.666
But this stuff she downloaded
sounds alarming.

17:24.702 --> 17:26.801
"Quantitative Precipitation Forecast."

17:26.838 --> 17:29.104
"Site Specific Hydrologic
Prediction System."

17:29.139 --> 17:30.353
A jury is gonna hear this

17:30.378 --> 17:31.841
and they're not gonna have
a clue what it means.

17:31.876 --> 17:32.942
They're just gonna think it sounds bad

17:32.977 --> 17:35.309
and she shouldn't have been
giving it to the Chinese.

17:37.046 --> 17:38.813
Unless...

17:38.849 --> 17:40.582
Unless what?

17:40.617 --> 17:43.017
Unless a jury doesn't hear this.

17:43.052 --> 17:44.373
- A bench trial?
- Yes.

17:44.408 --> 17:46.855
You want to try this in front
of a judge and not a jury?

17:46.890 --> 17:48.289
- Yes.
- Why?

17:48.324 --> 17:50.091
Because the jury's gonna get lost

17:50.126 --> 17:51.758
in the technical jargon of this case.

17:51.794 --> 17:53.760
This is about hydrological engineering

17:53.796 --> 17:56.429
and flow capacities
and moisture state variables.

17:56.465 --> 17:59.386
Is that what this is about?
Or is this about Mohammed Fayed?

17:59.421 --> 18:00.433
No.

18:00.469 --> 18:02.302
About a jury looking at your client

18:02.337 --> 18:03.804
and not at the evidence.

18:04.974 --> 18:06.139
I understand why you're nervous

18:06.174 --> 18:07.474
about taking this to a jury, Sandra.

18:07.509 --> 18:08.708
I do. Juries are scary.

18:08.743 --> 18:09.842
Because they're made up of people.

18:09.878 --> 18:14.013
With blinders and biases
and real human limitations.

18:14.048 --> 18:16.115
But a jury is the best chance you have.

18:16.150 --> 18:19.184
Because you have 12 chances with a jury

18:19.220 --> 18:21.521
and only one with a judge.

18:21.556 --> 18:23.254
If you think they need to understand

18:23.279 --> 18:25.189
this evidence in order to acquit Alice,

18:25.225 --> 18:27.191
then help them understand the evidence.

18:27.227 --> 18:29.528
That is your job,
and you are good at your job.

18:29.563 --> 18:31.029
Don't run from it.

18:44.680 --> 18:46.233
I think we should talk.

18:46.748 --> 18:49.815
The voice. Everything.
It all seems so real.

18:49.851 --> 18:50.946
May I come in?

18:53.788 --> 18:55.988
I think there's something odd
about this case.

18:56.023 --> 18:57.089
Yeah, me too.

18:57.125 --> 18:59.268
Like, I guess for me, it seems
a little odd that...

18:59.304 --> 19:01.227
- Nancy Martin was framed!
- Yes.

19:01.263 --> 19:03.229
And that the Southern
District of New Y...

19:03.264 --> 19:04.563
Wait, did you just say yes?

19:04.598 --> 19:05.949
- Yes.
- Yes, you said yes?

19:05.984 --> 19:07.766
- Yes.
- Okay.

19:07.801 --> 19:08.833
Can you just nod?

19:08.869 --> 19:09.768
Yes.

19:09.803 --> 19:10.835
- Nngh!
- Okay, look.

19:10.871 --> 19:13.004
I think the Gallaghers might
have had something to do

19:13.039 --> 19:14.939
with the situation Nancy is in right now.

19:14.975 --> 19:17.276
Then arrest them and drop
the charges against Nancy.

19:17.311 --> 19:20.078
There are issues here that make
it difficult for me to do that.

19:20.113 --> 19:21.011
I need your help.

19:21.046 --> 19:22.506
What else do you know
about the Gallaghers?

19:22.542 --> 19:24.214
- Just what I told you.
- We need more than that.

19:24.250 --> 19:25.783
So put some agents on it.

19:25.818 --> 19:27.718
Like I said, this is complicated.

19:27.754 --> 19:29.453
Do you have an investigator here?

19:29.489 --> 19:31.689
Uh, one. For the whole office.

19:31.724 --> 19:33.728
I've heard that there is more than
one agent in the FBI, though.

19:33.764 --> 19:34.892
Is that true?

19:34.927 --> 19:36.594
Maybe there's more history,

19:36.629 --> 19:39.193
an earlier altercation between
the Gallaghers and Nancy.

19:39.228 --> 19:41.555
Right. Those rumors
about Nancy selling drugs.

19:41.556 --> 19:42.655
If we can find out who started them...

19:42.690 --> 19:44.790
But didn't the principal say
there were multiple sources?

19:44.825 --> 19:47.360
So we ask other parents,
maybe even some kids?

19:47.395 --> 19:49.162
Wait, are we arguing or agreeing?

19:49.197 --> 19:50.381
I have no idea.

19:51.266 --> 19:52.398
Arguing.

19:52.434 --> 19:53.533
I'll call the principal.

19:53.568 --> 19:55.767
See if she can help us
set up some interviews.

19:59.039 --> 20:02.107
This was productive,
if highly unpleasant.

20:37.342 --> 20:39.142
Mr. Davis, what is your occupation?

20:39.177 --> 20:41.544
I'm now retired, but for 27 years,

20:41.580 --> 20:43.546
I was a special agent with the FBI.

20:43.582 --> 20:45.481
Did you have a particular area
of expertise within the Bureau?

20:45.516 --> 20:46.915
I worked in counterintelligence,

20:46.950 --> 20:49.118
with a focus on threats
to critical infrastructure.

20:49.153 --> 20:50.885
The government alleges that Ms. Huang

20:50.921 --> 20:52.287
jeopardized national security

20:52.323 --> 20:54.623
by downloading site-specific PMP values.

20:54.658 --> 20:56.791
What is a PMP value, Agent Davis?

20:56.827 --> 20:58.793
Possible maximum precipitation.

20:58.829 --> 21:00.829
Essentially, it means the chance of rain.

21:02.099 --> 21:04.632
Ms. Huang also allegedly downloaded HMRs.

21:04.667 --> 21:05.733
What is an HMR, Agent Davis?

21:05.768 --> 21:07.635
A hydrometeorological report.

21:07.670 --> 21:08.636
Weather forecast.

21:08.671 --> 21:09.770
How about an RVI?

21:09.805 --> 21:11.972
It basically is a report
on the amount of ice formed

21:12.008 --> 21:13.007
on a particular river.

21:13.042 --> 21:14.108
That's it?

21:14.144 --> 21:15.443
Yes.

21:15.478 --> 21:17.245
Huh. Okay.

21:17.280 --> 21:18.479
Agent Davis, in your view,

21:18.515 --> 21:21.615
would the distribution of any
of the data Ms. Huang downloaded

21:21.650 --> 21:23.416
from the National
Water Distribution Database

21:23.452 --> 21:25.619
jeopardize national security?

21:25.654 --> 21:26.653
No.

21:29.558 --> 21:32.925
Agent Davis, you have familiarity
with the Chinese government's

21:32.961 --> 21:35.028
espionage efforts
in this country, correct?

21:35.063 --> 21:38.664
Objection. Mr. Davis is here
to testify about infrastructure.

21:38.699 --> 21:41.167
Mr. Davis was put up as an
expert in counterintelligence.

21:41.202 --> 21:42.701
I'm entitled to ask him about that.

21:42.736 --> 21:44.803
I'll allow it. Sir, you may answer.

21:44.838 --> 21:46.505
- Yes.
- Isn't it true, Agent Davis,

21:46.541 --> 21:48.641
that when China cultivates
someone residing in this country

21:48.676 --> 21:50.042
for use in espionage programs,

21:50.077 --> 21:51.810
it is generally someone born in China,

21:51.845 --> 21:53.511
fluent in the language and customs,

21:53.547 --> 21:55.730
and who still maintains
broad and deep ties to China?

21:55.765 --> 21:56.757
Yes.

21:56.792 --> 21:57.882
Isn't it true, Agent Davis,

21:57.917 --> 22:00.552
that newly cultivated spies often begin

22:00.587 --> 22:02.987
with more mundane kinds
of intelligence-gathering

22:03.022 --> 22:05.557
in order to test their
capability and visibility?

22:05.592 --> 22:06.491
Yes.

22:06.526 --> 22:08.526
So the mere fact
that this scientific data

22:08.562 --> 22:10.227
might have been
of relatively minimal value

22:10.262 --> 22:12.529
doesn't necessarily tell us anything

22:12.565 --> 22:15.365
about whether Ms. Huang
is operating as an agent

22:15.401 --> 22:16.700
of the Chinese government?

22:16.735 --> 22:18.223
Objection! Prejudicial!

22:18.258 --> 22:20.136
Your Honor, Ms. Chavez is making
the outrageous suggestion...

22:20.172 --> 22:21.289
- Overruled.
- That just because

22:21.314 --> 22:22.406
Ms. Huang was born in China...

22:22.441 --> 22:23.640
Overruled.

22:25.611 --> 22:26.677
You may answer.

22:26.712 --> 22:28.010
That is correct.

22:28.045 --> 22:29.157
I do not know if Ms. Huang

22:29.192 --> 22:31.208
is an agent of the Chinese government.

22:32.016 --> 22:33.182
I suppose she could be.

22:43.127 --> 22:44.593
How's it going
with your fancy private school?

22:44.628 --> 22:46.060
I don't know if I like these parents

22:46.096 --> 22:47.729
or opposing counsel less.

22:47.764 --> 22:48.863
Do you have to choose?

22:48.898 --> 22:51.199
I guess not.

22:52.436 --> 22:54.336
I brought you these.

22:54.371 --> 22:55.837
Silver.

23:00.210 --> 23:02.443
- You okay?
- I have a job offer.

23:02.478 --> 23:05.279
You <i> were</i> going after Max Gillespie's
job in Public Corruption.

23:05.314 --> 23:06.513
In Texas.

23:08.651 --> 23:09.950
What?

23:09.985 --> 23:11.707
Solicitor General.

23:12.154 --> 23:14.888
Y-You have an offer

23:14.923 --> 23:17.224
to be the Solicitor General of Texas?

23:17.260 --> 23:20.126
I'm only a few years younger than
Ted Cruz was when he had the job.

23:20.161 --> 23:21.728
And I think I'd be better.

23:21.763 --> 23:23.929
So you're gonna take it?

23:23.965 --> 23:25.220
I don't know.

23:26.801 --> 23:28.701
What do you think I should do?

23:30.805 --> 23:34.474
I... think you should do
what you want to do.

23:34.509 --> 23:37.983
Yes, but what do <i> you</i> think I should do?

23:38.412 --> 23:39.778
Honestly.

23:43.984 --> 23:46.251
I have no opinion about it. Honestly.

23:46.287 --> 23:48.420
But I'm happy for you...

23:50.357 --> 23:52.123
if it's what you want.

23:55.127 --> 23:57.628
Well, I just wanted to let you know.

24:00.533 --> 24:02.500
Congratulations, Leonard.

24:22.057 --> 24:24.122
Do you want to toss it, or should I?

24:27.061 --> 24:28.594
You okay?

24:31.165 --> 24:33.232
I should get up.

24:58.990 --> 25:01.233
Have you been here all night?

25:01.860 --> 25:05.596
I broke the microwave at 4:15.

25:05.631 --> 25:07.097
It was intentional.

25:07.132 --> 25:08.407
I'm sorry.

25:10.102 --> 25:12.452
- You need to get some sleep, Sandy.
- Mnh-mnh.

25:15.506 --> 25:17.473
I am going to lose.

25:17.508 --> 25:20.008
You're not. Stop saying that.

25:20.686 --> 25:22.111
I am.

25:22.146 --> 25:23.839
I am.

25:24.682 --> 25:26.682
I am going to lose.

25:26.718 --> 25:29.151
Because this jury
is going to look at Alice

25:29.186 --> 25:31.119
and they are going to listen to Alice

25:31.154 --> 25:32.256
and they are going to think,

25:32.291 --> 25:34.322
"Spy. She is from China. She's a spy."

25:34.358 --> 25:36.157
And it doesn't matter what I say,

25:36.192 --> 25:38.092
because what I'm saying,
I'm not saying very well,

25:38.128 --> 25:39.794
because I'm pissed off...

25:39.829 --> 25:41.162
Listen to me.

25:41.197 --> 25:43.164
It's okay to be angry.

25:43.199 --> 25:45.032
But it is not your fault that Alice Huang

25:45.068 --> 25:47.534
shared data that she wasn't supposed to.

25:47.570 --> 25:49.970
It's not your fault that she
lied to the government about it.

25:50.005 --> 25:53.340
And it is not your fault that
Mohammed Fayed was found guilty.

25:53.376 --> 25:55.842
It <i> is</i> my fault. Don't say that.

25:55.878 --> 25:58.211
Please don't say that. Because it is.

25:58.247 --> 25:59.446
It <i> is</i> my fault.

25:59.482 --> 26:02.349
I was there to protect him,
and I did not!

26:02.385 --> 26:04.184
I did not protect him!

26:09.857 --> 26:11.324
I Di...

26:22.569 --> 26:24.469
It's wrong, Al.

26:26.507 --> 26:28.737
What's happening to her.

26:29.843 --> 26:33.144
She is being treated unfairly.

26:33.575 --> 26:35.046
So tell them that.

26:37.284 --> 26:39.183
Tell them that, Sandy.

26:43.088 --> 26:45.489
Ms. Cappelli, you had
the cubicle adjacent to Alice's

26:45.525 --> 26:47.157
at the USGS Water Science Center?

26:47.193 --> 26:49.059
That's right. For over two years.

26:49.094 --> 26:52.062
When she asked you for the
password and login instructions

26:52.097 --> 26:54.498
to the National Water Distribution
Database, did you give it to her?

26:54.534 --> 26:56.497
- Yes.
- Was that a difficult decision?

26:56.532 --> 26:58.368
It wasn't a decision at all, really.

26:58.403 --> 27:00.337
People share these passwords
all the time.

27:00.372 --> 27:02.739
I borrowed one
before I had one of my own.

27:02.774 --> 27:06.008
It wasn't considered a big deal, until...

27:06.044 --> 27:07.276
U-Until when?

27:07.312 --> 27:08.911
Until Alice used it.

27:10.248 --> 27:12.281
Mr. Jorgensen,
what is your area of expertise

27:12.317 --> 27:13.682
at the Geological Survey?

27:13.718 --> 27:16.084
I'm the Deputy Assistant Chief
of Engineers.

27:16.119 --> 27:17.219
And you've worked closely

27:17.254 --> 27:18.787
with foreign governments in this area?

27:18.823 --> 27:21.590
Primarily Norway.
I was born and educated there.

27:21.625 --> 27:24.560
In the past 18 months, how many
trips have you made to Norway

27:24.595 --> 27:25.961
in a professional capacity?

27:25.996 --> 27:26.962
Four trips.

27:26.997 --> 27:28.319
Did you ever share any data

27:28.354 --> 27:30.519
from the National
Water Distribution Database

27:30.554 --> 27:32.400
with the Norwegian government
on those trips?

27:32.435 --> 27:33.726
Yes. A lot.

27:33.762 --> 27:35.297
Was the USGS aware of this?

27:35.332 --> 27:39.206
Yes. I was given a commendation
for the work I did with Norway.

27:39.242 --> 27:41.376
As Chief Security Officer, you enforce

27:41.411 --> 27:44.311
all United States Geological
Survey rules and procedures,

27:44.347 --> 27:46.247
as well as maintain all IT records?

27:46.282 --> 27:47.247
That's correct.

27:47.282 --> 27:48.596
According to your records,

27:48.631 --> 27:50.884
how many USGS employees
have downloaded data from

27:50.919 --> 27:53.987
the National Water Distribution
Database in the last year?

27:54.022 --> 27:55.054
67.

27:55.090 --> 27:57.290
How many have been investigated,
to your knowledge?

27:57.325 --> 27:59.292
One. Alice.

28:07.034 --> 28:09.167
Is this a bad time? I... I can come back.

28:09.203 --> 28:10.870
Is everything okay?

28:12.339 --> 28:14.006
I hope so.

28:15.228 --> 28:18.411
What I'm about to do is...
unprofessional...

28:18.446 --> 28:19.978
- Okay.
- Inappropriate,

28:20.014 --> 28:23.458
and has a high likelihood
of making me seem like a fool.

28:23.493 --> 28:24.557
You're not really selling it.

28:24.593 --> 28:25.784
I love you.

28:29.355 --> 28:30.354
Seth...

28:30.390 --> 28:32.824
I'm not scared of you
beating me in a courtroom.

28:32.859 --> 28:34.926
I don't think you're controlling.

28:34.961 --> 28:37.828
I think... I was insecure,

28:37.863 --> 28:39.696
and you wanted me to be a better person.

28:39.732 --> 28:41.031
And I am now.

28:41.066 --> 28:43.166
I've done the work. I have changed.

28:43.201 --> 28:44.301
A lot.

28:44.336 --> 28:46.670
Except for the fact that
I'm still in love with you.

28:49.374 --> 28:51.174
- This is a lot.
- I know.

28:51.209 --> 28:53.343
And I'm not trying to overwhelm you.

28:53.378 --> 28:55.210
I'm not proposing.

28:55.246 --> 28:57.613
I'm not saying
we should move in together.

28:57.649 --> 29:00.282
I'm not saying we should do anything.

29:00.318 --> 29:02.485
I just want you to know how I feel

29:02.520 --> 29:05.020
and that I'd like you
to give me another chance.

29:08.192 --> 29:10.159
This is what I wanted to say.

29:15.332 --> 29:16.877
How do I look?

29:16.912 --> 29:17.876
What?

29:17.911 --> 29:19.167
Do I look like a prosecutor?

29:19.202 --> 29:21.331
You know? Tightly wound. Judgmental.

29:21.367 --> 29:22.519
Huge stick up my...

29:22.554 --> 29:24.339
Principal Hatcher! Nice to meet you.

29:24.374 --> 29:25.841
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

29:25.876 --> 29:27.308
Minor crisis with the new kiln.

29:27.344 --> 29:28.959
Please.

29:29.512 --> 29:31.846
We're hoping you can shed
some light on the relationship

29:31.881 --> 29:34.882
between Nancy Martin
and Michael and Dana Gallagher.

29:34.917 --> 29:36.484
The Gallaghers?

29:36.519 --> 29:38.085
They... Hm.

29:38.120 --> 29:39.386
How do I put this?

29:39.421 --> 29:41.021
They hated her?

29:41.056 --> 29:43.390
Well, "hate" might be too strong a word.

29:43.425 --> 29:44.705
But they certainly didn't want her

29:44.741 --> 29:46.158
to be head of the Parents' Association?

29:46.194 --> 29:47.440
Well, you have to understand,

29:47.476 --> 29:49.562
Michael and Dana both
went to Whitley themselves.

29:49.598 --> 29:51.898
They're very invested in its identity.

29:51.933 --> 29:53.733
And the head of the Parents' Association,

29:53.768 --> 29:55.368
well, for all intents and purposes,

29:55.403 --> 29:57.269
that person becomes
the face of the school

29:57.305 --> 29:58.811
for the period of their tenure.

29:58.847 --> 30:00.607
What's wrong with Nancy
being the face of the school?

30:00.642 --> 30:02.875
Well, she'd have a great deal
of contact with our funders,

30:02.910 --> 30:04.457
most of whom are alumni.

30:04.492 --> 30:07.278
And alumni appreciate
a certain history of the school.

30:07.314 --> 30:08.463
A culture.

30:08.498 --> 30:10.482
Nancy Martin, while she did manage

30:10.518 --> 30:12.417
to charm quite a few
of the other parents,

30:12.452 --> 30:14.720
did not reflect that culture.

30:14.755 --> 30:17.455
The rumors about Nancy dealing drugs...

30:17.491 --> 30:19.124
do you think there's any chance

30:19.159 --> 30:20.558
they were started by the Gallaghers?

30:20.593 --> 30:22.426
I can't imagine.

30:22.461 --> 30:24.662
Let me just say, Nancy Martin was the one

30:24.697 --> 30:27.498
who had the ecstasy
in the back seat of her car.

30:27.534 --> 30:30.467
Even if the Gallaghers
did help spread some rumors,

30:30.503 --> 30:33.148
obviously, they weren't unwarranted.

30:35.041 --> 30:36.940
Why don't you suggest some families.

30:36.975 --> 30:39.342
We can dig them up. We're good.

30:39.377 --> 30:41.310
I mean, we can't just sit here and
badger the woman all day, can we?

30:41.346 --> 30:42.345
She's got a job to do.

30:42.380 --> 30:43.613
- I ha...
- Come on. Up, up, up.

30:43.649 --> 30:45.081
Thank you, Principal Hatcher.

30:45.116 --> 30:46.416
Thank you.

30:50.656 --> 30:52.488
Hey.

30:52.524 --> 30:53.956
What the hell are you doing?

30:53.991 --> 30:55.123
Did you hear that?

30:55.159 --> 30:58.427
She said ecstasy was found
in the back seat of Nancy's car.

30:58.462 --> 30:59.674
Uh-huh. It was.

30:59.710 --> 31:01.630
And how did Principal Hatcher know that?

31:01.666 --> 31:03.999
Because that information
hasn't been publicly released.

31:04.035 --> 31:05.534
It wasn't in the indictment.

31:05.570 --> 31:08.370
Nobody knows that. Except us.

31:08.405 --> 31:09.838
You think she planted the drugs?

31:09.874 --> 31:11.439
I think she planted the drugs.

31:15.144 --> 31:16.343
Are we gonna hug?

31:16.379 --> 31:17.946
God, no.

31:17.981 --> 31:19.047
Okay. Cool.

31:21.317 --> 31:26.487
Alice Huang grew up in Hebei
province in Central China.

31:26.522 --> 31:28.989
She studied at Jilin University,

31:29.024 --> 31:30.891
moved to the United States
when she was 20,

31:30.926 --> 31:34.027
got her M.Sc. with
a concentration in Hydrology

31:34.063 --> 31:35.669
at Stony Brook...

31:36.364 --> 31:38.632
and fell in love with America.

31:38.667 --> 31:40.533
She is a mother of two boys.

31:40.569 --> 31:43.570
She's a board member
at her local Boys & Girls Club.

31:43.606 --> 31:44.870
She likes Drake.

31:44.906 --> 31:47.539
She's a long-suffering Knicks fan.

31:47.575 --> 31:50.225
She is a New Yorker.

31:51.278 --> 31:53.395
She is an American.

31:54.415 --> 31:56.314
Why is she here?

31:57.284 --> 31:58.900
Why are <i> you</i> here?

31:59.587 --> 32:02.988
Is it because Alice borrowed a password?

32:03.023 --> 32:05.490
You heard the testimony
of Jennifer Cappelli.

32:05.525 --> 32:09.027
Passwords are shared
all the time in Alice's office.

32:09.062 --> 32:11.096
Is it because Alice downloaded data

32:11.131 --> 32:14.065
from the National
Water Distribution Database?

32:14.101 --> 32:18.086
66 other people downloaded
the same data last year.

32:19.605 --> 32:21.339
Why is she here?

32:22.241 --> 32:24.300
Why are <i> you</i> here?

32:25.277 --> 32:29.179
Is it because Alice
exchanged scientific data

32:29.214 --> 32:32.082
with a colleague from another country?

32:32.118 --> 32:36.218
Jonas Jorgensen exchanged
the exact same data

32:36.254 --> 32:38.587
in the exact same way.

32:38.623 --> 32:40.589
He was rewarded.

32:40.625 --> 32:43.361
She was arrested.

32:43.928 --> 32:45.762
Why is she here?

32:45.797 --> 32:47.764
Why are <i> you</i> here?

32:49.934 --> 32:51.567
One of the great misunderstandings

32:51.602 --> 32:53.101
of the American criminal justice system

32:53.137 --> 32:54.803
is that it is a search for the truth.

32:54.838 --> 32:55.976
It is not.

32:56.011 --> 32:57.973
When the judge gives you his instructions

32:58.008 --> 33:00.542
and you head back to that jury room,

33:00.577 --> 33:03.465
you will not be asked
to return with the truth.

33:04.281 --> 33:07.582
You will be asked only
to return with a verdict.

33:07.617 --> 33:10.718
"Guilty" or "Not guilty."

33:10.753 --> 33:13.821
Did the Government meet
its burden of proof or not?

33:13.856 --> 33:17.058
I believe the evidence
is clear that it did not.

33:17.093 --> 33:21.733
I believe the evidence is clear
that Alice Huang is not guilty.

33:22.498 --> 33:24.431
But the truth also matters here.

33:24.466 --> 33:25.599
So let's tell the truth.

33:25.634 --> 33:30.670
The truth is, she is here,
you are here, we are all here,

33:30.706 --> 33:32.338
because she is not <i> from</i> here.

33:32.373 --> 33:35.474
That is why we are here.
That is the dark truth.

33:38.880 --> 33:41.480
And what you do...

33:41.516 --> 33:44.714
here, now...

33:45.686 --> 33:50.553
that will either be
a light out of this darkness...

33:51.792 --> 33:56.195
or this is where we will stay.

34:04.026 --> 34:05.125
Hey.

34:05.160 --> 34:07.428
The indictment against
Principal Hatcher. Just filed.

34:07.463 --> 34:08.829
Excellent!

34:08.864 --> 34:10.431
I don't have to defend her, do I?

34:10.466 --> 34:11.665
Unlikely.

34:11.699 --> 34:15.156
But if you did, she'd be in good hands.

34:15.190 --> 34:16.831
- That sounded like a...
- I always thought you'd be

34:16.856 --> 34:18.462
a good lawyer if you tried.

34:20.159 --> 34:22.159
You're trying.

34:22.184 --> 34:23.717
There's something about the way you talk

34:23.742 --> 34:25.208
that makes me feel bad inside.

34:25.234 --> 34:27.234
And yet, I like it, too.

34:27.514 --> 34:31.016
I guess... that's just honesty.

34:40.231 --> 34:41.862
I understand you've reached
a unanimous verdict.

34:41.899 --> 34:43.899
- Is that correct?
- Yes, Your Honor.

34:45.936 --> 34:49.654
In the case of
United States vs. Alice Huang,

34:50.273 --> 34:53.774
we the jury find the defendant,
Alice Huang,

34:53.810 --> 34:57.245
not guilty of espionage
against the United States.

35:35.149 --> 35:37.182
I told you you were gonna win.

35:37.218 --> 35:38.417
I told you.

35:38.453 --> 35:39.854
You never told me that.

35:39.890 --> 35:41.319
Well, I thought it.

35:41.355 --> 35:42.654
What are you still doing here?

35:42.689 --> 35:44.021
Come on!

35:44.057 --> 35:45.624
I didn't win.

35:45.659 --> 35:48.159
That's a win. Trust me.

35:48.194 --> 35:49.380
Fayed.

35:50.997 --> 35:52.467
No.

35:53.333 --> 35:54.802
Not that.

35:55.469 --> 35:56.467
You still might.

35:56.502 --> 35:58.802
I should've done better. More.

35:58.837 --> 36:01.171
This proves that.
If I could do it over again...

36:01.206 --> 36:04.275
If you could do it over, Sandra,
you would probably lose again.

36:04.310 --> 36:06.042
Because this job is hard,

36:06.078 --> 36:09.346
and you need to find a way
to give yourself a break.

36:09.382 --> 36:11.382
This relentlessness, this intensity,

36:11.417 --> 36:14.651
this quest for perfection...

36:14.686 --> 36:16.686
it is what will make you truly great,

36:16.721 --> 36:19.422
but it can also break you.

36:21.393 --> 36:24.827
Do not let it break you.

36:31.502 --> 36:33.669
Okay.

36:33.704 --> 36:36.838
Listen. I've been doing
a lot of research about Texas,

36:36.873 --> 36:39.675
and here is what I know about Texas.

36:39.710 --> 36:41.310
First, you will have to live in Austin.

36:41.345 --> 36:43.645
- Everybody loves Austin.
- Precisely my point.

36:43.681 --> 36:45.880
It's one of the fastest-growing
cities in America.

36:45.916 --> 36:47.548
- Is that a positive?
- It's exhausting.

36:47.583 --> 36:50.318
People in Austin spend more time
waiting in line for food

36:50.353 --> 36:52.486
- than any other city in America.
- You're insane.

36:52.522 --> 36:54.154
Well, maybe <i> I</i> should
move to Austin, then,

36:54.190 --> 36:57.325
where thousands of insane people
stand on a bridge

36:57.360 --> 37:00.093
waiting for bats
to fly out at dusk every night.

37:00.129 --> 37:03.864
Now, look, I like animals
as much as anyone. But bats?

37:05.149 --> 37:06.199
Here is a list

37:06.234 --> 37:08.768
of other things I know you hate

37:08.804 --> 37:12.238
that you can expect a lot of in Austin.

37:12.273 --> 37:16.209
100-degree days... Austin had 73 in 2011.

37:16.244 --> 37:17.377
No pro sports.

37:17.412 --> 37:19.045
Very few black people.

37:19.080 --> 37:20.213
Cricket swarms.

37:20.248 --> 37:24.750
The never-changing reality
that it is surrounded by Texas.

37:24.785 --> 37:25.851
Also, the worst cities

37:25.886 --> 37:29.105
are the ones that also double
as people's first names.

37:29.757 --> 37:31.423
Think about it.

37:31.459 --> 37:33.726
Seven presidents have come from New York.

37:33.761 --> 37:34.760
Three from Texas.

37:34.795 --> 37:35.927
You'd be much better off

37:35.963 --> 37:37.830
starting your political career here.

37:41.167 --> 37:43.901
Listen, you've always trusted me

37:43.936 --> 37:48.072
to help you weigh decisions,
to guide you,

37:48.107 --> 37:50.460
give you cold analytical...

37:51.944 --> 37:53.143
analysis.

37:53.179 --> 37:56.212
And... you should stay.

38:00.986 --> 38:03.787
There is one more thing on this list.

38:03.822 --> 38:06.392
The truth is, this...

38:07.659 --> 38:09.793
could have been the entire list.

38:13.297 --> 38:15.398
I will miss you...

38:18.269 --> 38:19.402
so much.

38:26.343 --> 38:28.080
I already said yes.

38:29.346 --> 38:30.578
To the job.

38:34.451 --> 38:35.750
- If I had known...
- No.

38:37.554 --> 38:39.353
No.

38:39.389 --> 38:41.552
It's a good decision.

38:42.358 --> 38:43.721
It makes sense.

38:44.460 --> 38:47.059
You can... forget all this.

38:48.431 --> 38:49.530
Will you stay?

38:49.565 --> 38:51.364
We never really made a tradition

38:51.400 --> 38:53.333
out of Hand Pulled Noodle House #3.

38:53.368 --> 38:55.335
I have to go.

39:38.444 --> 39:40.110
Don't tell me you love me.

39:40.145 --> 39:41.078
I don't.

39:41.113 --> 39:42.346
Good.

39:43.749 --> 39:45.649
You do look fine, though.
I will say that.

39:59.998 --> 40:01.924
Sorry, it's just...

40:02.601 --> 40:04.801
I could really use someone to talk to.

40:04.836 --> 40:06.302
It's okay.

40:06.337 --> 40:07.805
Allison?

40:08.507 --> 40:09.472
Yeah.

40:09.508 --> 40:10.573
Oh.

40:10.609 --> 40:12.143
I, uh...

40:12.943 --> 40:14.543
I understand.

40:17.515 --> 40:20.048
Have you seen "Rocky IV"?

40:20.083 --> 40:21.717
- No.
- It's the best one.

40:21.752 --> 40:24.620
Okay. Sure.

40:24.655 --> 40:25.821
You okay?

41:23.843 --> 41:25.810
You are worthy.
