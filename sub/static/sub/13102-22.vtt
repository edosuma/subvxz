WEBVTT

00:03.833 --> 00:06.500
(Garibaldi)
The Interstellar Alliance
based on the Homeworld

00:06.583 --> 00:08.250
of the Minbari Federation

00:08.333 --> 00:11.083
was founded
in the Earth year 2261

00:11.167 --> 00:14.083
shortly after the end
of the Shadow War..

00:14.167 --> 00:16.083
...20 years ago.

00:16.167 --> 00:18.750
20 years of history.

00:18.833 --> 00:21.500
Those of us who survived
have seen it all.

00:21.583 --> 00:24.208
And those of us who understand
have been waiting

00:24.292 --> 00:27.667
and dreading
the arrival of this day.

00:33.292 --> 00:37.125
(Lorien)
Step into the abyss..

00:37.208 --> 00:39.000
...and let go.

00:39.083 --> 00:40.750
What if I die?

00:40.833 --> 00:43.542
I cannot create life

00:43.625 --> 00:46.583
but I can breathe
on the remaining embers.

00:48.250 --> 00:50.417
It may not work.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.458
But I can hope.

00:52.542 --> 00:56.667
(Lorien)
Hope is all that we have.

00:56.750 --> 00:59.417
His life-force
must be replenished.

01:01.750 --> 01:05.083
I give of myself
to replenish him..

01:07.042 --> 01:08.250
...for a little while.

01:09.500 --> 01:10.958
(Delenn)
How long?

01:11.042 --> 01:15.417
In human terms,
barring injury and illness

01:15.500 --> 01:19.917
perhaps 20 years,
but no more than that.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.667
And then, one day,
he will simply..

01:25.750 --> 01:27.083
...stop.

01:27.167 --> 01:29.292
[breathing heavily]

01:50.625 --> 01:53.333
Are you okay?

01:53.417 --> 01:54.958
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:56.458 --> 02:00.000
I just, ahem, need to get
a little air, that's all.

02:02.167 --> 02:04.000
You go back to sleep.

02:42.458 --> 02:44.000
(Delenn)
'Hello.'

02:46.583 --> 02:50.333
Well, I thought you were
going back to sleep.

02:50.417 --> 02:53.917
I decided to go out in search
of the same air molecules

02:54.000 --> 02:55.542
you were looking for.

02:55.625 --> 02:57.833
On the theory
that if they were good enough

02:57.917 --> 03:00.042
to lure you out of our bed

03:00.125 --> 03:02.667
I should investigate
my competition.

03:02.750 --> 03:06.333
[chuckles]
You've never had competition.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.917
It's a pretty night.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.583
Yes, it is.

03:13.875 --> 03:16.333
I just wanna sit here..

03:17.167 --> 03:18.542
[sighs]

03:19.542 --> 03:21.375
...watch the sun come up.

03:23.542 --> 03:25.000
It occurred to me

03:25.083 --> 03:27.583
that in all my time here
I've never done that.

03:29.667 --> 03:32.792
I wanna know
what it looks like when it

03:32.875 --> 03:34.542
comes up over the horizon.

03:36.292 --> 03:39.375
So I can carry a picture
of it in my head.

03:42.292 --> 03:44.083
You had the dream again?

03:46.583 --> 03:48.500
It's the third night in a row.

03:50.083 --> 03:51.333
I know.

03:53.708 --> 03:57.708
It's possible that it may not
mean what you think.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.500
[exhales]

04:04.417 --> 04:06.125
It does.

04:09.542 --> 04:14.583
It was...20 years ago
that I died on Z'ha'dum.

04:16.417 --> 04:21.708
Lorien said that he could extend
my life 20 years, no more.

04:25.792 --> 04:27.958
I'm almost out of time, Delenn.

04:30.417 --> 04:33.875
I can feel it in my blood,
in my bones.

04:39.042 --> 04:41.125
Just a little further to go..

04:43.792 --> 04:46.042
...time enough.

04:50.833 --> 04:53.083
Do you want me
to send the messages?

04:55.125 --> 04:58.000
Yes, send them.

05:03.708 --> 05:05.167
The sun is coming up.

05:06.292 --> 05:09.333
[instrumental music]

05:20.583 --> 05:21.667
And at 2:00,
you're scheduled to attend

05:21.750 --> 05:22.833
the opening of Memorial Park.

05:22.917 --> 05:24.375
Most of the joint chiefs
will be there

05:24.458 --> 05:26.042
and they'd like you
to say something.

05:26.125 --> 05:29.000
The usual about the sacrifices
of our brave men and women

05:29.083 --> 05:31.542
young people saving the world
for those who would follow..

05:31.625 --> 05:33.500
Yadda-yadda-yadda,
you can do it in your sleep.

05:33.583 --> 05:34.792
(Ivanova)
'I have.'

05:34.875 --> 05:36.500
This evening,
there's a reception

05:36.583 --> 05:40.083
for the new ambassador
from Narn, formal dress.

05:40.167 --> 05:41.750
We'll have the press corps
there just in case

05:41.833 --> 05:43.417
anyone says
anything interesting.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.208
[Ivanova chuckles]
'Like that's gonna happen.'

05:45.292 --> 05:47.750
Well, it's a good
photo opportunity.

05:47.833 --> 05:49.042
I'm tired of them.

05:49.125 --> 05:51.208
But, general,
you're an important person.

05:51.292 --> 05:54.417
I feel like an old war-horse
trotted out after a parade

05:54.500 --> 05:56.333
so all the kids
can point at it.

05:56.417 --> 05:59.458
Besides, nobody gives a damn
about anything I have to say.

05:59.542 --> 06:01.708
Why should they?
I certainly don't.

06:01.792 --> 06:04.917
- You're being much too modest.
- No, I'm not.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.708
And if I hear
one more patronizing

06:06.792 --> 06:08.375
"Pat her on the head
and everything will be fine"

06:08.458 --> 06:09.917
word out of your mouth,
I'll kick your..

06:14.000 --> 06:16.417
I'm sorry, general.
He insisted on barging in.

06:16.500 --> 06:17.625
I have a message.

06:17.708 --> 06:19.292
I told him you
were in a meeting.

06:19.375 --> 06:21.625
- Who from?
- I think you know.

06:21.708 --> 06:23.458
I told you before,
if a ranger shows up

06:23.542 --> 06:26.625
I want him brought to me
immediately, no delays.

06:28.333 --> 06:30.458
I was just following
protocol, general.

06:30.542 --> 06:33.375
'There's a time and a place
and a way of doing things.'

06:33.458 --> 06:34.792
'Frankly,
I don't much care for'

06:34.875 --> 06:37.042
'the attitude
of some of these rangers.'

06:37.125 --> 06:38.500
Thank you.

06:40.458 --> 06:42.167
Thank you.

06:42.250 --> 06:43.375
Tell him I'm on my way.

06:44.542 --> 06:47.292
- On your way where?
- Minbar.

06:47.375 --> 06:50.042
I want a shuttle fueled
and ready to go in 15 minutes.

06:51.542 --> 06:54.125
[instrumental music]

06:57.250 --> 06:58.958
[knock on door]

06:59.042 --> 07:00.792
(Vir)
'What?'

07:04.375 --> 07:08.125
Majesty, we've just
received a courier from Minbar.

07:08.208 --> 07:09.417
What?

07:09.500 --> 07:12.542
Majesty, we've just
received a courier from Minbar.

07:18.417 --> 07:20.000
I see.

07:30.167 --> 07:31.625
I'm sorry.

07:35.083 --> 07:37.750
Tell the prime minister
to cancel all my appointments

07:37.833 --> 07:39.333
for the next several days.

07:39.417 --> 07:41.542
But you didn't even
read what the note says.

07:41.625 --> 07:45.542
I don't have to.
I already know.

07:45.625 --> 07:48.208
[instrumental music]

07:56.417 --> 07:58.083
[sighs]

07:58.167 --> 07:59.833
Lousy Dodgers.

08:01.792 --> 08:03.542
Please, Uncle Stephen,
just one more game?

08:03.625 --> 08:06.000
- Just one, just one, come on.
- No. Not a chance.

08:06.083 --> 08:08.167
But the interschool
tennis match is tomorrow.

08:08.250 --> 08:09.875
I have to practice.

08:09.958 --> 08:12.125
Ohh! We already
played three sets.

08:12.208 --> 08:16.042
Ohh! Michael, this kid of yours
is trying to kill me.

08:16.125 --> 08:18.958
And they said the younger
generation doesn't have goals.

08:19.042 --> 08:21.333
Dad!

08:21.417 --> 08:23.583
Alright, come on, take it easy
on your Uncle Stephen.

08:23.667 --> 08:26.625
He's, he's old and decrepit.

08:26.708 --> 08:28.583
He's led such a clean lifestyle
he doesn't have

08:28.667 --> 08:30.375
the stamina
to deal with life.

08:30.458 --> 08:32.917
Now, I, on the other hand
will be out in a minute

08:33.000 --> 08:35.625
to show you how the game
is supposed to be played.

08:35.708 --> 08:38.042
Uh-huh. Talk is cheap.

08:38.125 --> 08:39.833
Let's see how you do
on the court.

08:39.917 --> 08:42.792
[chuckles]
Go, go on! Get!

08:42.875 --> 08:45.292
[laughs]

08:45.375 --> 08:46.792
Oh, where's Lise?

08:46.875 --> 08:48.917
I didn't get a chance
to say good morning.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.875
She's out shopping. She wanted
to get an early start.

08:51.958 --> 08:55.208
You know how nuts the stores get
right before Independence Day.

08:56.917 --> 09:00.042
- Ahem. Comfortable?
- Yeah.

09:00.125 --> 09:02.292
Oh. So..

09:03.542 --> 09:06.625
How's the Edgars-Garibaldi
empire doing today?

09:06.708 --> 09:09.500
Oh. Stocks haven't moved
up or down in over a week.

09:12.042 --> 09:14.375
So you're steady.
What's wrong with that?

09:14.458 --> 09:16.708
- Steady ain't sexy.
- Oh.

09:16.792 --> 09:19.958
We need the capital to expand
our resources back home.

09:20.042 --> 09:24.417
And speaking of, when are you
supposed to head back to Earth?

09:24.500 --> 09:26.000
Booked a flight out tomorrow.

09:26.083 --> 09:27.542
Well, hey, hey,
that's the thing

09:27.625 --> 09:29.917
about being the chief
of xenobiological research.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.958
There's always another
new alien virus

09:32.042 --> 09:33.625
coming off the next starship.

09:35.292 --> 09:37.000
Well, I mean, you could at least
stay around for Mary.

09:37.083 --> 09:39.000
It's her first tournament,
and the president can do

09:39.083 --> 09:40.458
without you
for a few more days.

09:40.542 --> 09:43.125
I can't, I mean,
I just wanted to come by

09:43.208 --> 09:44.333
and see how you were doing,
you know?

09:44.417 --> 09:46.167
It's too long between visits.

09:46.250 --> 09:48.625
I wanted to see Lise.

09:48.708 --> 09:50.667
- Dad?
- Yeah, hon?

09:50.750 --> 09:53.667
There's someone here
to see you.

09:53.750 --> 09:55.208
Oh, yeah?

10:01.458 --> 10:03.000
Thank you.

10:11.083 --> 10:12.792
Is everything alright?

10:12.875 --> 10:16.333
Yeah, fine, fine.
Why don't you go on outside?

10:16.417 --> 10:18.667
I'll be out there
in just a minute, okay?

10:18.750 --> 10:19.917
[instrumental music]

10:20.000 --> 10:22.292
[sighs]
Is that what I think it is?

10:25.000 --> 10:26.708
Sheridan's dying.

10:28.125 --> 10:30.542
[sighs]
He wants us to come
to Minbar for

10:30.625 --> 10:32.792
one last get-together before..

10:32.875 --> 10:35.333
Well, before.

10:37.042 --> 10:39.708
Alright, I'll call
the office. They can wait.

10:39.792 --> 10:42.292
Book a flight for one or two?

10:42.375 --> 10:44.375
Well, Stephen,
John and I may have had

10:44.458 --> 10:49.250
our differences in the past,
but he is a good man

10:49.333 --> 10:52.042
and he's my friend.

10:52.125 --> 10:53.500
Two.

10:55.125 --> 10:58.167
[instrumental music]

11:12.333 --> 11:13.750
[instrumental music]

11:21.833 --> 11:23.083
[beeping]

11:23.167 --> 11:25.500
Well?

11:25.583 --> 11:27.208
Well, it's hard to..

11:29.542 --> 11:31.750
I never understood
what Lorien did to you

11:31.833 --> 11:34.750
or-or how the energy
streams through your blood.

11:34.833 --> 11:36.417
I, I don't know
enough about them

11:36.500 --> 11:38.250
to make a completely
accurate prognosis.

11:38.333 --> 11:39.750
There's just
too many variables.

11:39.833 --> 11:43.125
Stephen...get to it.

11:44.583 --> 11:46.417
How long have I got?

11:50.917 --> 11:53.125
It's-it's hard to say exactly.

11:54.875 --> 11:56.458
That's the point.

11:59.042 --> 12:01.000
If I had to guess,
I'd say, uh..

12:03.042 --> 12:06.083
...four or five days,
week at the outside.

12:06.167 --> 12:08.708
[mellow music]

12:11.042 --> 12:12.542
Done this sort of thing
a 100 times

12:12.625 --> 12:14.542
and I still don't know
what to say.

12:14.625 --> 12:17.375
- Well..
- 'I'm sorry.'

12:24.542 --> 12:28.167
- How's Delenn taking it?
- Well, she's Minbari.

12:30.542 --> 12:33.125
You know, sometimes
I look at her

12:33.208 --> 12:36.708
and I know exactly
what she's thinking.

12:38.833 --> 12:40.292
Sometimes..

12:41.875 --> 12:43.542
...she's a mystery to me.

12:44.875 --> 12:47.208
Oh, they're are a million
years of difference

12:47.292 --> 12:49.000
between our cultures.

12:49.083 --> 12:51.833
Try all you want
you never completely

12:51.917 --> 12:56.167
overcome that,
not in a 100 years, not in 20.

12:59.417 --> 13:01.083
But she'll be okay.

13:02.292 --> 13:03.917
She's a great
council-in-training

13:04.000 --> 13:06.958
if not in fact anymore.

13:07.042 --> 13:10.208
I don't think there's anything
she can't handle.

13:10.292 --> 13:13.083
John...I can come back.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.833
No, no.
I'm-I'm, I'm all done.

13:15.917 --> 13:17.625
The others are waiting
for me downstairs.

13:17.708 --> 13:19.917
Well, you tell 'em
I'll be right down.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.833
And, Stephen.

13:23.625 --> 13:25.083
Thank you.

13:27.625 --> 13:29.500
- John--
- Did you get everything?

13:31.292 --> 13:33.167
- It-it took some doing.
- Uh-huh?

13:33.250 --> 13:35.000
I believe it will
be quite a party.

13:35.083 --> 13:38.708
Well, that's exactly
what I want, a celebration.

13:38.792 --> 13:41.833
No sad smiles,
no-no struggling for words.

13:41.917 --> 13:44.500
- John, John--
- Shouldn't we get downstairs?

13:46.083 --> 13:48.208
Can't keep our guests waiting.

13:56.208 --> 13:57.542
Come on.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.292
(Garibaldi)
'And him, him,
he's got this drunk Pak'ma'ra.'

14:04.375 --> 14:06.333
'He's got him on the deck
and he's shaking him, saying'

14:06.417 --> 14:07.417
"What did you do
with the data crystal?

14:07.500 --> 14:08.750
Where's the data crystal?"

14:08.833 --> 14:11.083
Because, if you remember
it was hidden inside..

14:11.167 --> 14:12.708
- A cat.
- A dead cat.

14:12.792 --> 14:15.125
And he ate it.

14:15.208 --> 14:17.917
And all of a sudden this
Pak'ma'ra just goes, rraaaaaaa!

14:18.000 --> 14:20.167
Just up all over him,
it was the most horrible vile

14:20.250 --> 14:22.417
disgusting thing
you'd ever seen in your life.

14:22.500 --> 14:23.958
'And all John could
do was stand there--'

14:24.042 --> 14:26.292
- You, you were no help at all.
- What?

14:26.375 --> 14:28.458
He just stood there laughing
his ass off.

14:28.542 --> 14:29.750
It was funny.

14:29.833 --> 14:31.125
Well, it was eating
through my uniform.

14:31.208 --> 14:33.375
And that was the funny part.

14:33.458 --> 14:34.917
Where's my PPG?

14:35.000 --> 14:37.917
- Somebody get me a gun!
- Are you okay?

14:40.542 --> 14:42.458
You know, Londo never liked
the Pak'ma'ra.

14:42.542 --> 14:46.542
I mean, they're stubborn,
lazy, obnoxious, greedy.

14:46.625 --> 14:49.333
Kind of look like an octopus
that got run over by a truck.

14:49.417 --> 14:50.917
That, too.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.958
But one day, Londo and I were
walking past their quarters

14:55.042 --> 14:57.625
and we heard them...singing.

14:57.708 --> 15:00.125
Singing? They can sing?

15:00.208 --> 15:01.958
Oh, there's nothing about
that in the literature.

15:02.042 --> 15:04.083
Apparently
it's something they only do

15:04.167 --> 15:05.500
certain times of the year

15:05.583 --> 15:08.292
as part of their
religious ceremonies.

15:08.375 --> 15:09.875
[sighs]

15:09.958 --> 15:12.667
You may not believe this
but it was

15:12.750 --> 15:15.292
the most beautiful sound
I had ever heard.

15:15.375 --> 15:17.292
I-I couldn't make
out the words

15:17.375 --> 15:22.167
but I knew that it was full
of sadness and hope and wonder

15:22.250 --> 15:27.667
and a terrible sense of loss.

15:27.750 --> 15:31.792
I-I looked at Londo and,
this is the amazing part.

15:33.375 --> 15:36.750
There was a tear
running down his face.

15:37.958 --> 15:39.792
I said, "Londo,
we-we, we should leave.

15:39.875 --> 15:41.208
I mean, this is upsetting you."

15:41.292 --> 15:44.375
And...he just stood there

15:44.458 --> 15:46.792
and listened.

15:48.208 --> 15:50.833
And when it was over,
he turned to me and he said

15:52.250 --> 15:56.458
"There are 49 Gods
in our Pantheon, Vir.

15:56.542 --> 15:59.125
"To tell you the truth, I never
believed in any of them.

16:00.458 --> 16:03.042
"But if only
one of them exist

16:05.292 --> 16:08.042
then God sings
with that voice."

16:09.792 --> 16:11.125
[chuckles]

16:12.750 --> 16:14.167
It's funny.

16:15.458 --> 16:18.042
After everything
we had been through

16:18.125 --> 16:20.250
all he did..

16:20.333 --> 16:22.875
[mellow music]

16:26.667 --> 16:28.458
...I miss him.

16:35.958 --> 16:37.750
A toast.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.625
To absent friends..

16:43.917 --> 16:47.042
...in memory still bright.

16:50.875 --> 16:52.208
G'Kar.

16:53.750 --> 16:55.375
Londo.

16:55.458 --> 16:57.750
Lennier.

16:57.833 --> 16:59.458
- Mar--
- Marcus.

17:00.333 --> 17:02.875
[music continues]

17:39.625 --> 17:40.875
[sighs]

17:47.625 --> 17:50.208
Susan, are you alright?

17:51.208 --> 17:53.667
Yeah, I'm fine, I just..

17:53.750 --> 17:55.708
I was just watching John.

17:55.792 --> 17:58.917
You really can't tell
by looking at him that he's..

18:00.792 --> 18:02.708
...he's the same old John.

18:04.250 --> 18:07.667
I cannot imagine
how you're handling this.

18:07.750 --> 18:12.167
We have had 20 years
to talk about it and prepare.

18:12.250 --> 18:15.833
I'm ready, as much as anyone
can be ready.

18:17.292 --> 18:19.000
But I'm going to miss him.

18:20.250 --> 18:23.208
I'm going to miss him
terribly, Susan.

18:23.292 --> 18:24.958
So will I.

18:27.417 --> 18:29.333
Is that why
you were so quiet?

18:31.792 --> 18:33.292
I've just..

18:34.917 --> 18:37.542
I've buried so many
friends, Delenn.

18:39.333 --> 18:42.875
I'm beginning to resent it
and I don't want to.

18:44.250 --> 18:46.000
[sighs]
It seems like some days..

18:47.417 --> 18:50.667
...there's no one left
to play with.

18:50.750 --> 18:53.042
There's no joy anymore.

18:53.125 --> 18:58.208
I don't know
what I'm doing anymore or why.

18:58.292 --> 19:00.458
[sniffles]

19:00.542 --> 19:03.375
I'm surprised
that David's not here.

19:03.458 --> 19:06.042
He's in a ranger training
mission to Drazi space.

19:06.125 --> 19:09.333
We'd interrupt his training
but John doesn't want that.

19:10.458 --> 19:12.000
The day he joined the rangers

19:12.083 --> 19:15.833
we agreed that he would not
receive any special treatment.

19:15.917 --> 19:18.250
No, no.

19:18.333 --> 19:21.875
John's wish was to see
his dear friends one more time

19:21.958 --> 19:23.542
the way they are.

19:23.625 --> 19:28.333
And for David to remember
his father the way he was, not..

19:30.167 --> 19:31.417
[sighs]

19:34.083 --> 19:35.250
There is something I need

19:35.333 --> 19:37.250
to talk to you about
before you leave.

19:37.333 --> 19:38.667
Yeah?

19:38.750 --> 19:42.208
As you know, two years ago
John refused to accept

19:42.292 --> 19:45.292
re-election to the presidency
of the Interstellar Alliance.

19:45.375 --> 19:47.250
But the committee chose me
as his replacement.

19:47.333 --> 19:50.333
My first instinct
was to decline but

19:50.417 --> 19:52.167
John felt it
was important to accept.

19:52.250 --> 19:54.375
Well, he was right. You've done
an excellent job, Delenn.

19:54.458 --> 19:56.083
Perhaps.

19:56.167 --> 19:59.208
Since then, John dedicated
most of his time

19:59.292 --> 20:02.708
to working with the rangers
because I was now distracted.

20:02.792 --> 20:04.167
When he..

20:05.833 --> 20:08.917
...when he leaves us

20:09.000 --> 20:12.667
I will need someone to take his
place as head of the rangers.

20:12.750 --> 20:15.500
I would prefer a human
in this role

20:15.583 --> 20:18.458
to maintain the balance
we've created.

20:18.542 --> 20:22.708
I was hoping
you would consider the job.

20:22.792 --> 20:25.250
Me?

20:25.333 --> 20:26.667
Why me?

20:26.750 --> 20:29.875
I know you're not happy with
your responsibilities back home.

20:29.958 --> 20:32.833
Here, you would have a chance
to build something new

20:32.917 --> 20:36.750
answerable only to me.
No politics, no bureaucracy.

20:38.042 --> 20:39.583
Can I have some time
to think about it?

20:39.667 --> 20:43.500
Of course,
all the time you need.

20:43.583 --> 20:45.500
- You're tired.
- No.

20:45.583 --> 20:47.375
It's late. You should rest.

20:47.458 --> 20:49.042
You're right.

20:51.750 --> 20:54.000
Goodnight, Delenn.

20:54.083 --> 20:57.917
Thank you for the offer
...for everything.

20:59.667 --> 21:02.208
[mellow music]

21:17.708 --> 21:20.333
- John.
- Did you talk to her?

21:20.417 --> 21:23.000
well, do you think
she will take it?

21:23.083 --> 21:24.917
I think she might.

21:26.583 --> 21:29.167
Where are the others?

21:29.250 --> 21:31.125
They are putting Vir to bed

21:31.208 --> 21:33.083
which is where we should be.

21:33.167 --> 21:35.125
[chuckles]

21:35.208 --> 21:37.792
[instrumental music]

21:47.917 --> 21:51.958
I thought you would be asleep
by now.

21:52.042 --> 21:54.208
I'm not sleepy.

21:57.292 --> 22:00.875
Do you know what tomorrow is?

22:00.958 --> 22:05.208
In Earth time I mean.

22:05.292 --> 22:07.458
Sunday.

22:07.542 --> 22:11.750
When I was a kid
every Sunday dad would take us

22:11.833 --> 22:15.458
out for a drive.

22:15.542 --> 22:18.333
We never knew
where we were going.

22:18.417 --> 22:20.500
That was half the fun.

22:22.208 --> 22:24.000
We'd just go.

22:25.833 --> 22:28.208
He'd say, "Pick a direction."

22:29.708 --> 22:33.833
And one of us would point
and...off we'd go.

22:37.333 --> 22:39.083
[chuckles]

22:43.500 --> 22:45.875
Tomorrow is..

22:45.958 --> 22:47.542
...Sunday, Delenn.

22:52.667 --> 22:55.083
And I'm going out for a drive.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.208
[exhales]

23:10.708 --> 23:13.125
What..

23:13.208 --> 23:15.125
What about the others?

23:20.875 --> 23:23.333
I'll-I'll leave early in
the morning before they're up.

23:23.417 --> 23:25.833
There's no point
in waking them.

23:27.542 --> 23:31.833
Mm, we had our time,
said what we wanted to say.

23:34.167 --> 23:37.792
Any more would...
just get in the way.

23:44.333 --> 23:48.083
I wanna feel space beneath me

23:48.167 --> 23:49.917
one last time.

23:52.208 --> 23:53.750
It's where I belong.

23:54.792 --> 23:57.167
It's where I've always belonged.

24:00.250 --> 24:03.917
Besides, e-everything
we've built here

24:04.000 --> 24:05.750
and with the Alliance..

24:08.042 --> 24:11.083
...has, has become..

24:12.250 --> 24:17.042
...half reality...
half mythology.

24:19.333 --> 24:24.292
And if it all ends here
like it ends anywhere else..

24:26.375 --> 24:28.458
...but if it ends out there..

24:30.708 --> 24:33.417
...they'll remember it.

24:33.500 --> 24:34.958
[mellow music]

24:35.042 --> 24:36.750
It'll make it a little
easier for you

24:36.833 --> 24:39.417
to keep the others in line.

24:42.083 --> 24:45.375
Well, the other Minbari
will approve.

24:45.458 --> 24:50.250
Their idea of, of going
to the sea and all-all that.

24:51.750 --> 24:54.375
Always thinking strategy..

24:54.458 --> 24:56.458
...even now.

24:59.375 --> 25:02.958
Well, that's why you love me,
isn't it?

25:09.125 --> 25:11.083
No.

25:11.167 --> 25:13.250
There are many reasons..

25:13.333 --> 25:15.083
...but that's not one of them.

25:17.167 --> 25:18.792
One last thing..

25:22.917 --> 25:25.750
Tomorrow there will be no
talk of this.

25:28.250 --> 25:30.917
I want it to be a good day...

25:31.000 --> 25:32.792
...a happy day.

25:35.167 --> 25:36.667
I want that.

25:38.333 --> 25:40.375
I want it a great deal.

I haven't seen you in that
in a long time.

- It looks good.
- Thanks.

26:33.250 --> 26:37.500
It feels a little snug
in some places.

26:37.583 --> 26:39.750
Must have shrunk
while it was in storage.

26:40.958 --> 26:44.583
Yes. I'm sure that must be it.

26:46.500 --> 26:48.125
You look beautiful.

26:48.208 --> 26:52.625
I'm told by a reasonably
reliable source..

26:52.708 --> 26:56.583
...that today is Sunday
on the Earth calendar.

26:56.667 --> 26:58.958
One dresses up on Sunday,
does one not?

27:00.375 --> 27:02.250
One does.

27:07.917 --> 27:09.667
Have you been outside yet?

27:12.125 --> 27:13.875
It's a pretty day.

27:15.917 --> 27:18.042
The perfect day..

27:18.125 --> 27:20.250
...for a Sunday drive.

It is..

The others will be awake soon.

Commander William Nils,
sir. I'm sorry.

30:00.958 --> 30:02.250
No one told us you were coming.

30:02.333 --> 30:03.792
Oh, it's alright.
It's alright.

30:03.875 --> 30:07.250
I was just in the neighborhood.
Thought I'd stop in.

30:07.333 --> 30:09.042
Where is everyone?

30:09.125 --> 30:10.917
Well, there's just me, sir.

30:11.000 --> 30:15.083
And the shut-down crew,
and...a few others.

30:15.167 --> 30:17.208
- What shut-down crew?
- 'Oh, sorry.'

30:17.292 --> 30:20.208
Uh, public announcement
hasn't been made yet.

30:20.292 --> 30:23.542
I think they're still working
on the press release.

30:23.625 --> 30:25.875
But since this place
was turned back over

30:25.958 --> 30:27.375
to Earth Control
a few years ago

30:27.458 --> 30:31.042
and what with the recent
budget cutbacks and..

30:31.125 --> 30:33.042
...so much of what Babylon 5
stands for

30:33.125 --> 30:36.583

by the Alliance, well..

...no one comes here anymore,
it's, heh..

30:39.333 --> 30:41.500
...well, it's become
sort of redundant.

30:48.375 --> 30:50.583
[chuckles]
Redundant.

30:50.667 --> 30:52.875
- Yes, sir.
- Hmm.

30:52.958 --> 30:56.583
Earthdome says it's to be
decommissioned and taken out.

30:58.125 --> 31:00.917
Well, w-we can't
just leave it here.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.833
It would be a menace
to navigation.

31:05.667 --> 31:07.167
Of course.

Looks like we're still tied
together, even now.

Nothing. Nothing.

Are, are you alright?

31:25.167 --> 31:26.583
[mellow music]

31:27.667 --> 31:29.917
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.583
I'm just tired.
It was a long trip.

31:34.667 --> 31:36.958
You're welcome
to inspect the facilities.

31:37.042 --> 31:39.292
I can have someone
show you around.

31:40.625 --> 31:43.125
[chuckles]

31:43.208 --> 31:45.708
I know the way, commander.

31:47.750 --> 31:49.208
Mm.

31:51.542 --> 31:54.167
[music continues]

(Zack)
Sheridan died
trying to attack Z'ha'dum!

32:08.417 --> 32:11.000
No one who goes there
comes back alive!

32:11.083 --> 32:12.833
We can end this!

32:12.917 --> 32:16.833
Not just for now, not just
for the next 1000 years

32:16.917 --> 32:18.042
but for ever!

32:18.125 --> 32:19.667
[cheering]

32:19.750 --> 32:21.667
We'll just stand together!

32:30.792 --> 32:33.708
So you hear 'em too, huh?

32:33.792 --> 32:34.833
Well, Zack!

32:34.917 --> 32:36.875
[both laugh]

32:36.958 --> 32:38.458
What the hell
are you doing here?

32:38.542 --> 32:40.292
I thought you went back
to Earth.

32:40.375 --> 32:43.167
Yeah, I did. Got bored.

32:43.250 --> 32:45.625
Re-upped about six months ago.

32:45.708 --> 32:47.875
I figure I'll be here
till they turn the lights out.

32:47.958 --> 32:51.708
Yeah. Well, that explains
why the letter came back.

32:51.792 --> 32:54.792
- What letter?
- Ah, nothing. Nothing.

32:54.875 --> 32:57.375
What was that you said
about hearing them?

32:57.458 --> 33:00.917
Ah, it's this place.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.125
Quarter million people

33:03.208 --> 33:07.208
coming and going every day
for 25 years.

33:07.292 --> 33:11.625
Every part of this station has
somebody's fingerprints on it.

33:11.708 --> 33:15.000
Layers and layers
of people's lives.

33:17.417 --> 33:19.042
There were times..

33:19.125 --> 33:21.500
...I thought none of us
would get out alive.

33:23.708 --> 33:25.750
Some of us didn't.

33:27.958 --> 33:32.458
But...we did everything
we said we were gonna do

33:32.542 --> 33:36.375
and nobody can take that away
from us or this place.

33:37.833 --> 33:40.292
So you staying for the ceremony?

33:41.958 --> 33:43.083
Hmm?

33:43.167 --> 33:45.625
Well, I figured
that's why you came

33:45.708 --> 33:47.542
for the decommissioning
ceremony.

33:49.083 --> 33:52.458
No. No. I, uh, I can't stay.

33:52.542 --> 33:55.500
I-I was just
in the neighborhood.

33:55.583 --> 33:57.667
Thought I'd stop in.

33:57.750 --> 34:00.458
Well, I was just gonna get
something to eat.

34:00.542 --> 34:02.250
You wanna come with me?

34:04.708 --> 34:09.542
And then, one day
he will simply..

34:09.625 --> 34:10.708
...stop.

34:12.667 --> 34:14.292
You okay?

34:16.667 --> 34:19.750
I'm fine.
Fine, Zack. Thanks.

34:19.833 --> 34:23.375
You sure you don't wanna
get something to eat?

34:23.458 --> 34:25.000
No.

34:25.083 --> 34:29.250
Sure wish I could,
but...I won't have time.

34:33.292 --> 34:35.583
I just wanted to..

34:35.667 --> 34:38.625
...come and have
a last look around.

34:38.708 --> 34:40.792
[instrumental music]

34:41.875 --> 34:43.583
I should really be going.

34:45.125 --> 34:47.458
Well, I'll walk you back
to the docking bay.

34:47.542 --> 34:50.583
- Where you headed?
- Coriana system.

34:50.667 --> 34:52.375
Where we won the Shadow war.

34:52.458 --> 34:53.750
[both laugh]

34:55.750 --> 34:57.708
[instrumental music]

34:58.583 --> 35:00.000
Computer..

35:01.583 --> 35:03.333
...set course.

35:03.417 --> 35:05.333
(automated message)
'Destination?'

35:07.583 --> 35:09.292
Coriana VI.

35:11.750 --> 35:13.875
Best speed.

indicator entering danger zone.'

36:11.958 --> 36:13.875
Monitors off.

36:15.500 --> 36:17.917
Turn it all off.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.083
There's too damn much noise.

36:25.167 --> 36:27.833
[chuckles]
Better.

36:29.875 --> 36:32.458
[music continues]

36:56.208 --> 37:00.167
(Lorien)
Who are you?
What do you want?

37:01.250 --> 37:03.375
Why are you here?

37:05.042 --> 37:07.042
'Where are you going?'

37:12.208 --> 37:13.292
Lorien.

37:13.375 --> 37:16.083
Did you think
we had forgotten you?

37:16.167 --> 37:18.750
We have been waiting for you.

37:18.833 --> 37:21.125
Beyond the rim.

37:21.208 --> 37:22.875
Yes.

37:26.250 --> 37:27.917
There's..

37:29.125 --> 37:33.792
...so much I still
don't understand.

37:33.875 --> 37:35.625
As it should be.

37:38.083 --> 37:39.667
Can I come back?

37:41.083 --> 37:44.708
'No. This journey is ended.'

37:44.792 --> 37:50.500
'Another begins.
Time to rest now.'

37:54.250 --> 37:56.708
[instrumental music]

38:12.917 --> 38:15.167
Ohh.

38:15.250 --> 38:16.667
Well..

38:18.125 --> 38:19.875
...look at that.

38:21.792 --> 38:23.750
The sun's coming up.

An expedition to Coriana space

38:45.208 --> 38:47.417
found Sheridan's ship
a few days later.

38:47.500 --> 38:49.833
But they never found him.

38:49.917 --> 38:51.750
All the air locks
were sealed

38:51.833 --> 38:55.042
but there was no trace
of him inside.

38:55.125 --> 38:58.542
Some of the Minbari believe
he'll come back someday

38:58.625 --> 39:01.167
but I never saw him again
in my lifetime.

39:03.333 --> 39:05.042
They're ready.

39:20.667 --> 39:22.083
[sighs]

Babylon 5 was the last
of the Babylon stations.

40:52.792 --> 40:54.833
There would never be another.

40:57.417 --> 41:01.250
It changed the future
and it changed us.

41:06.125 --> 41:09.083
It taught us that
we have to create the future..

41:10.667 --> 41:13.042
...or others will do it
for us.

41:16.542 --> 41:19.042
It showed us that we have
to care for one another

41:19.125 --> 41:22.000
because if we don't,
who will?

41:25.792 --> 41:28.542
[music continues]

41:28.625 --> 41:31.292
And that true strength
sometimes comes from

41:31.375 --> 41:34.417
the most unlikely places.

41:44.583 --> 41:46.125
Mostly, though

41:46.208 --> 41:48.250
I think it gave us hope

41:48.333 --> 41:50.792
that there can always be
new beginnings..

41:53.750 --> 41:55.958
...even for people like us.

42:02.500 --> 42:03.917
As for Delenn..

42:04.000 --> 42:06.917
...every morning
for as long as she lived

42:07.000 --> 42:09.458
Delenn got up before dawn

42:09.542 --> 42:12.583
and watched the sun come up.
