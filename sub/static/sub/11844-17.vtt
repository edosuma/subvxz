18:25.036 --> 18:27.767
You know, they don't act like
it's the end of the world.

18:27.839 --> 18:30.672
Is that how he acted,
like it was the end of the world?

18:30.742 --> 18:35.839
- [ Sighs ] Yeah.
- He say anything specific you remember?

18:35.914 --> 18:39.373
“Life was wrong.
Everything about life is a lie.

18:39.451 --> 18:42.182

None of them saw anything
unusual in his behavior at the time...

18:59.838 --> 19:03.365
but, looking back, they think
they saw some warning signs-

19:03.441 --> 19:06.342
moody, sometimes confident,
even cocky, other times...

19:06.411 --> 19:08.539
<i>sullen, quiet, unfocused.</i>

Mr. Whitman...

20:52.117 --> 20:54.779

- Right.
- Sure.

21:09.234 --> 21:13.068
So, finally I left.
He was losing it.

21:13.138 --> 21:16.802
And you could totally see it in his eyes.
I mean, he was on his way out of this life.

21:16.875 --> 21:20.209
- Is that a fact?
- Oh.

21:22.213 --> 21:25.080

I've been thinking about it
forawhile.

21:47.238 --> 21:50.173
[Sighs] I talked to Mom this morning,
and she's fine with it, so-

21:50.241 --> 21:53.506
Look, Isabel, this isn't the right time to
be making snapjudgments about things.

21:53.578 --> 21:56.206
- It's my life, Max.
- No one is disputing that!

21:56.281 --> 21:58.579
Do we have to
talk about this right now?

21:58.650 --> 22:00.914
Maria's right. This isn't a
decision we have to make today.

22:00.985 --> 22:03.010
This isn't a decision <i>we</i> have
to make at all. It's my decision.

22:03.088 --> 22:07.321
I've made it.
I'm leaving Roswell.

22:09.094 --> 22:11.324
- And then what did he say?
- I don't know.

22:11.396 --> 22:14.195
I mean,
“Life isn't right“ or “Life is wrong.“

22:14.265 --> 22:17.064
- Something like that.
- Yeah, and then what did you say?

22:17.135 --> 22:20.571
- Oh, I said, “Whatever, dude.“
- "Whatever, <i>dude</i> ”?

22:20.638 --> 22:23.972
That's your reaction
to a man who is devastated...

22:24.042 --> 22:26.773

for you now...

23:16.895 --> 23:19.865
- No. I do not need another grief counselor.
- would be to go on home-

23:19.931 --> 23:24.164
I want some answers. I know what
happened to Alex was not an accident.

23:24.235 --> 23:27.967
I know it with every fiber in my being,
and I am gonna to find out the truth.

23:28.039 --> 23:32.169
So cut the crap and tell me
what the photo means to you.

23:35.513 --> 23:37.447
Okay.

- You're not going to like what
I'm about to say. - Tell me!

23:41.553 --> 23:45.717
It's beginning to look
more and more likely...

23:45.790 --> 23:50.352
that Alex might've deliberately turned
his car into the oncoming traffic.

23:53.698 --> 23:58.363
Wh-
Wh-Why would he do that?

24:00.338 --> 24:03.137
The last couple of weeks...

24:03.208 --> 24:06.234
people have noticed changes
in Alex's behavior--

24:06.311 --> 24:11.044
moodiness, lack of focus,
his grades started to slip.

24:11.115 --> 24:14.278
- Oh, please!
- Liz, I interviewed the truck driver.

24:14.352 --> 24:17.913
L-I went to the accident scene.
I saw the school reports.

24:17.989 --> 24:21.220
You are saying that Alex
killed himself over bad grades.

24:21.292 --> 24:24.262
We may never know exactly
why Alex did what he did.

24:24.329 --> 24:28.197
But look at this.
This is part of the puzzle, isn't it?

24:28.266 --> 24:30.428
I mean, look at it!

24:30.501 --> 24:33.198
He deliberately defaced
his own image.

24:33.271 --> 24:37.208
Believe me, it-
it tears me up to even have to say this.

- No, it's not true, okay? It's not true.

37:16.899 --> 37:19.266

Of course, it's not true.

is pretty convincing.

I can't believe it- suicide.

37:50.300 --> 37:53.531
<i>It wasn't a suicide,
and I can prove it!</i>

37:53.603 --> 37:56.834
Five minutes ago,
I found these here in Alex's room.

37:56.906 --> 37:59.466
They're concert tickets
to Beth Orton.

37:59.542 --> 38:02.671
Alex bought them on the day
he died, probably for him and Isabel.

38:02.745 --> 38:05.407
<i>The concert is tonight.</i>

38:05.481 --> 38:09.714
Don't you get it? You don't buy concert
tickets on the clay you kill yourself.

You don't make plans for the future when

38:25.935 --> 38:30.873
There's nothing to be gained
with this argument one way or another.

38:30.940 --> 38:33.637
<i>We know Alex. We know
what kind of guy he is.</i>

38:33.710 --> 38:36.008
- And we know he'd never kill himself.
- Exactly.

38:36.079 --> 38:38.013
So...

38:38.081 --> 38:41.244
as far as all the people in this room are
concerned, it was an accident, nothin' more.

38:41.317 --> 38:44.753
It wasn't an accident.

38:45.988 --> 38:49.322
- He was murdered.
- Murdered?

38:49.392 --> 38:51.622
Would you listen to yourself?

38:51.694 --> 38:53.992
Who could possibly
want to murder Alex?

38:54.063 --> 38:56.327
I don't know yet.

38:56.399 --> 38:58.800
Maybe somebody
with a grudge against him...

38:58.868 --> 39:02.805

39:04.407 --> 39:06.501
That is not what happened here.

do with this! - Keep your voices down!

39:21.591 --> 39:24.617
You cannot deny the fact that a key
member of this conspiracy...

39:24.694 --> 39:27.629
just died under
very suspicious circumstances.

<i>I'm with Liz.
There's somethin' not right about this.</i>

39:30.466 --> 39:34.164
It was a traffic accident. There's
nothing otherworldly about that.

39:34.237 --> 39:36.433
- What possible reason would an alien
have to kill Alex? - Isabel for one.

39:36.506 --> 39:39.373
We know there's an alien named Kivar
who wants to bring Isabel back to your world.

39:39.442 --> 39:41.376
- No.
- If Kivar discovered that you and Alex-

39:41.444 --> 39:43.378
No, no! You'rejust making this up!

39:43.446 --> 39:47.076
You don't know what the hell you're talking
about! You don't know anything about Kivar...

39:47.150 --> 39:49.744
- or our world. - You don't wanna
think Alex was killed by an alien...

39:49.819 --> 39:52.845
because that would mean
you are responsible!

39:56.626 --> 39:58.958
Let's go.

40:09.105 --> 40:11.369
I know what I know.
