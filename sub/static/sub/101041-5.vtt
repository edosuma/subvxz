that no one ever does

27:18.169 --> 27:19.704

27:19.738 --> 27:22.307
the way it uses some of
the black arts, shall we say,

27:22.340 --> 27:23.742
and some of the bending.

27:23.775 --> 27:26.911
And the fact that you do
something that,

27:26.945 --> 27:28.480
in this type of illusion,

27:28.513 --> 27:31.249
the person usually turns
themselves

27:31.282 --> 27:33.551

of the trick.

27:33.585 --> 27:36.888

and because she's smaller,

27:36.921 --> 27:38.890
doing that and then doing that

27:38.923 --> 27:42.060
makes it much stronger
and much more deceptive.

33:06.751 --> 33:09.620
- Especially to have them
up here so close.

33:09.654 --> 33:11.155
- Well, remember in my package,

33:11.189 --> 33:12.924
I mentioned
that I had a surprise

33:12.957 --> 33:14.125
I wanted to share?

33:14.158 --> 33:15.493
- Sure.

33:15.526 --> 33:18.796
- I don't want to say anything,
so can you read that?

33:23.134 --> 33:25.837
- Hmm.

33:25.870 --> 33:27.905
Is this supposed to be
our little secret?

33:27.939 --> 33:30.308
- Our little secret. For now.
- Okay.

33:30.341 --> 33:32.777
Let's go to the boys and see
if you've bagged a trophy.

33:32.810 --> 33:34.679
- All right.
- [chuckles] Boys?

33:34.712 --> 33:37.348
- Hello, Chad.
- Hey, Penn.

33:37.382 --> 33:41.185
- It said in the package there
that you had a secret,

33:41.219 --> 33:44.322
which I think you kept
from almost everyone.

33:44.355 --> 33:47.125
But I'm not gonna get to that
right away.

33:47.158 --> 33:48.593
- Okay.

33:48.626 --> 33:50.962
- But the other thing is, uh,
Chad Allen is your name.

33:50.995 --> 33:52.530
- Yes.

33:52.563 --> 33:54.532
- This trick is a wonderful,
wonderful trick

33:54.565 --> 33:56.100
and it made me think of someone

33:56.134 --> 33:58.469
who might be a relative
of yours.

33:58.503 --> 33:59.771
Do you know Don Alan?

33:59.804 --> 34:01.205
- Yes, I do.
- You do?

34:01.239 --> 34:04.075
And that might give you
a little bit of information,

34:04.108 --> 34:06.811
but the trick was done
absolutely beautifully

34:06.844 --> 34:09.614
and we absolutely loved it,

34:09.647 --> 34:14.652
but I think that secret
that I haven't mentioned yet

34:14.685 --> 34:16.920
makes the trick that you did

34:16.954 --> 34:20.291
about a thousand times
more amazing.

34:20.324 --> 34:23.428
So you've done
something crazy here

34:23.460 --> 34:26.230
in that you've done a trick
that was actually

34:26.264 --> 34:30.301
about a thousand times better
than you let the audience know.

34:30.333 --> 34:32.937
Do you want to tell them that?
- Sure.

34:32.969 --> 34:35.672
I have no sight at all.
[audience exclaims]

34:35.706 --> 34:41.012
I'm actually blind.
[applause]

34:41.045 --> 34:43.281
- So Chad, did they figure out
your trick?

34:43.313 --> 34:46.516
- They did.
- Aw, well, thank you.

34:46.551 --> 34:48.518
- Thank you.
- Oh--

34:48.553 --> 34:50.353
Chad Allen!

34:50.388 --> 34:53.357
[cheers and applause]

34:53.391 --> 34:54.926
[sighs]

34:54.958 --> 34:58.329
We have one more major dose
of magic for you.

34:58.362 --> 35:02.033
This one will be administered
by the masters themselves.

35:02.066 --> 35:04.202
Penn and Teller perform next.

35:04.235 --> 35:07.004
[upbeat music]

35:12.176 --> 35:14.378
[upbeat music]

35:14.412 --> 35:16.280
[cheers and applause]

35:16.314 --> 35:19.584
- Penn and Teller spent lots of
time in their magic laboratory

35:19.617 --> 35:22.653
concocting strange
and unusual tricks.

35:22.687 --> 35:25.156
Here with one
of their newest creations,

35:25.189 --> 35:28.059
Penn and Teller!

35:28.092 --> 35:30.161
- We need someone with a ring.

35:30.194 --> 35:33.097
Anybody got a ring?
A really distinctive ring.

35:33.131 --> 35:34.932
Who's got a ring
and a really distinctive ring

35:34.966 --> 35:36.667
that you recognize quickly?

35:36.701 --> 35:39.804
It's also gotta come off
your fingers--mine barely do.

35:39.837 --> 35:41.672
But I need someone
that has a ring

35:41.706 --> 35:45.143
that will come off their finger
and will come up on stage.

35:45.176 --> 35:47.812
And Teller has found someone.
Right up here, please.

35:47.845 --> 35:49.447
[applause]

35:49.480 --> 35:51.082
And what is your name,
our newest friend?

35:51.115 --> 35:52.083
- [indistinct]
- Say it again?

35:52.116 --> 35:53.117
- Bonnie.
- Bonnie.

35:53.151 --> 35:54.118
Hello, Bonnie.
- Hello.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.419
- Teller's got the ring here.

35:55.453 --> 35:57.421
Now tell us about this ring
here, Bonnie.

35:57.455 --> 35:59.590
- Well,
it's a very special ring

35:59.624 --> 36:01.425
because an ex-boyfriend,
I said,

36:01.459 --> 36:03.294
"Done with the exes
and marrying myself."

36:03.327 --> 36:05.029
- Oh, did you really do that?
- Yeah.

36:05.062 --> 36:06.764
But I put it
on the middle finger,

36:06.797 --> 36:09.534
so it was like, [bleep].
[laughter]

36:09.567 --> 36:11.636
- Which stands for "Fool Us."
- Exactly.

36:11.669 --> 36:14.071
- And what is this ring
made of?

36:14.105 --> 36:16.741
- It's platinum
and it's really good diamonds.

36:16.774 --> 36:17.742
- Do you believe
it's real platinum?

36:17.775 --> 36:19.110
- Yeah, it is, it's platinum.

36:19.143 --> 36:20.278
- What, they told you that
when you bought it?

36:20.311 --> 36:21.779
- That's what they told me.

36:21.812 --> 36:22.947
- 'Cause there's only one way
to test real platinum.

36:22.980 --> 36:24.115
- Oh, God.

36:24.148 --> 36:25.816
- And that is to put it
in boiling acid.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.818
[audience exclaims]
And I've got some good news

36:27.852 --> 36:28.986
and some bad news for you,
Bonnie.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.421
- [groans]

36:30.454 --> 36:32.823
- The good news is
that was real platinum.

36:32.857 --> 36:34.559
- Oh.
[laughter]

36:34.592 --> 36:37.795
was
real platinum.

36:37.828 --> 36:38.930
- Yeah, um.

36:38.963 --> 36:40.264
- We've--we've dissolved it
there.

36:40.298 --> 36:41.432
- It was very special.

36:41.465 --> 36:42.567
- We've also proven that
you weren't a witch,

36:42.600 --> 36:43.901
so that's good.

36:43.935 --> 36:46.270
But we have here
a hypodermic needle, Bonnie.

36:46.304 --> 36:48.139
- Okay.
- And we're gonna suck up

36:48.172 --> 36:51.142
some of
Bonnie's ring goodness.

36:51.175 --> 36:53.978
And that is boiling
and it's very hot,

36:54.011 --> 36:55.479
but I'm gonna suck up--

36:55.513 --> 37:00.718
and you'll see the platinum
and diamond opulescence

37:00.751 --> 37:05.056
that's dissolved
in the acid there, Bonnie.

37:05.089 --> 37:06.924
And, uh--
ah, there we go.

37:06.958 --> 37:08.392
Can you see
how good a ring that was?

37:08.426 --> 37:10.394
You can see the opulescence
in there floating around.

37:10.428 --> 37:12.096
- Okay.

37:12.129 --> 37:15.399
- We're gonna talk a little bit
about homeopathy.

37:15.433 --> 37:20.137
Homeopathy is a pseudoscience,
or as we say, bull[bleep].

37:20.171 --> 37:21.439
[laughter]

37:21.472 --> 37:24.308
The idea is
the more you dilute something,

37:24.342 --> 37:27.044
the stronger it gets--
that's nonsense.

37:27.078 --> 37:30.248
We do have things that are
real like DNA and stem cells.

37:30.281 --> 37:31.983
They're able to take
the essence of something

37:32.016 --> 37:33.451
and grow it,

37:33.484 --> 37:36.721
but we need to grow something
to grow the essence.

37:36.754 --> 37:39.056
We need an artificial womb.

37:39.090 --> 37:41.759
And the closest we have
is this watermelon.

37:41.792 --> 37:43.160
Have you examined
this watermelon thoroughly?

37:43.194 --> 37:44.829
- I did.

37:44.862 --> 37:46.230
- Does it seem like
a nice, healthy watermelon?

37:46.264 --> 37:47.798
- I wanna bite into it.
- We're gonna try to grow--

37:47.832 --> 37:49.267
you will.
- [chuckles]

37:49.300 --> 37:50.935
- We're gonna try
to grow your ring in there.

37:50.968 --> 37:52.503
Would you take
this hypodermic needle

37:52.536 --> 37:54.472
full of Bonnie ring goodness

37:54.505 --> 37:56.240
and would you inject it
into the watermelon?

37:56.274 --> 37:57.775
But keep in mind,

37:57.808 --> 38:00.244
the watermelon does not feel
pain like you and me.

38:00.278 --> 38:01.912
It's like a lobster.

38:01.946 --> 38:04.181
And don't just skin pop it.
Go for a vein.

38:04.215 --> 38:06.217
Shoot it up, shoot it up.
- All right, here it goes.

38:07.451 --> 38:08.586
- [screams]
- Inject it all the way.

38:08.619 --> 38:09.887
[laughter]

38:09.920 --> 38:12.590
And when that blood shoots up
the dropper's neck,

38:12.623 --> 38:15.393
that watermelon feels like
Jesus' son.

38:15.426 --> 38:16.694
Inject it all,
you gotta get it all.

38:16.727 --> 38:18.129
I want the whole ring.
- Got it.

38:18.162 --> 38:19.430
- Now put it in the sharps
container right here.

38:19.463 --> 38:20.698
- Safety first.

38:20.731 --> 38:22.433
- And children watching
at home,

38:22.466 --> 38:25.469
make sure you ask your parents
about buying you a souvenir

38:25.503 --> 38:27.605
Penn and Teller
hypodermic needle.

38:27.638 --> 38:29.640
[laughter]
Now, um, Bonnie.

38:29.674 --> 38:31.409
Your ring is growing

38:31.442 --> 38:34.745
in the warm, pink insides
of the watermelon.

38:34.779 --> 38:37.248
- The diamond's gonna
get bigger? Yes!

38:37.281 --> 38:39.050
- It will grow
to that size, maybe.

38:39.083 --> 38:40.318
Now I want
to show you something.

38:40.351 --> 38:42.953
We're gonna do
some real science now

38:42.987 --> 38:45.222
with laparoscopic surgery.

38:45.256 --> 38:48.926
Back over here, but don't get
too close to the watermelon

38:48.959 --> 38:51.228
because there is some
watermelon shrapnel

38:51.262 --> 38:53.397
when we do this.
[laughter]

38:53.431 --> 38:54.465
As we, uh--

38:56.934 --> 38:58.736
a little bit, yeah.

38:58.769 --> 38:59.970
Now you can move
a little closer, here.

39:00.004 --> 39:01.205
- [chuckles]

39:01.238 --> 39:03.374
- We also have a laparoscopic
camera here, Bonnie.

39:03.407 --> 39:04.909
- Oh, cool.

39:04.942 --> 39:06.944
- And you can see your face
in the monitor there.

39:06.977 --> 39:09.347
- Well, hello.
- And now we're going in!

39:09.380 --> 39:11.115
[laughter]
We're going in.

39:11.148 --> 39:14.685
You know, when I look at that,
it looks to me like

39:14.719 --> 39:16.620
well, it looks to me
a little bit like

39:16.654 --> 39:18.222
the inside of a watermelon,
doesn't it?

39:18.255 --> 39:19.857
Yeah.

39:19.890 --> 39:22.727
Teller's fishing around
in the watermelon

39:22.760 --> 39:25.529
and--oh, what's that, Teller?

39:25.563 --> 39:26.630
Up a little bit,
up a little bit.

39:26.664 --> 39:28.799
Oh, I think I saw it.

39:28.833 --> 39:31.702
Look at that,
look at that growing inside

39:31.736 --> 39:34.972
the moist, pink goodness
of the watermelon.

39:35.005 --> 39:37.441
There is Bonnie's ring.
[cheers and applause]

39:37.475 --> 39:38.809
Goodness gracious.

39:38.843 --> 39:42.279
But other magicians
might be done right there.

39:42.313 --> 39:43.547
We're gonna take the next step.

39:43.581 --> 39:46.317
I have here a surgical tool

39:46.350 --> 39:48.619
which I shudder
to think what it's used for.

39:48.652 --> 39:50.821
[laughter]

39:50.855 --> 39:52.590
I'm going in, Bonnie,
I'm going in.

39:52.623 --> 39:56.127
Watch me going in,
watch me going in.

39:56.160 --> 39:57.828
I'm going in, I'm going in.

39:57.862 --> 40:00.931
I'm gonna try to--
see, any other magic act

40:00.965 --> 40:04.268
the end would be the object
in an impossible location,

40:04.301 --> 40:07.004
but with Penn and Teller,
it's the extraction--

40:07.037 --> 40:08.439
oh, look at that.

40:08.472 --> 40:09.774
I got a hold of it.
See me? I'm holding it.

40:09.807 --> 40:11.275
I'm holding it there.
- It's gorgeous.

40:11.308 --> 40:12.510
- Now, you bought this ring
for yourself?

40:12.543 --> 40:13.978
- I did.
- Now, I want you to see this.

40:14.011 --> 40:15.679
It's gonna come right out
this hole here.

40:15.713 --> 40:16.947
Look at this, Bonnie.
- Okay.

40:16.981 --> 40:19.650
- You bought such a
[bleep]damn opulent ring

40:19.683 --> 40:21.185
for yourself.

40:21.218 --> 40:23.921
It will not fit out the tender
hole of the watermelon.

40:23.954 --> 40:25.156
- Okay.

40:25.189 --> 40:26.357
- So we're gonna do
a cesarean.

40:26.390 --> 40:27.425
We'll do a cesarean.
[laughter]

40:27.458 --> 40:28.826
- Okay.
- Take the knife, Bonnie.

40:28.859 --> 40:30.261
- Well, I've had natural
childbirth, so.

40:30.294 --> 40:31.962
- Cut it right there.
Take the knife right there.

40:31.996 --> 40:33.597
Be careful, it really is sharp.

40:33.631 --> 40:35.466
And cut the watermelon
right in half.

40:35.499 --> 40:37.868
Careful not
to cut the plastic there.

40:37.902 --> 40:39.170
There you go, Bonnie.

40:39.203 --> 40:40.671
- All the way down?
- Yeah, all the way down.

40:40.704 --> 40:41.705
All the way down, Bonnie,
all the way down.

40:41.739 --> 40:43.007
Beautiful, Bonnie.

40:43.040 --> 40:44.708
Now Bonnie, I want you
to see this moment,

40:44.742 --> 40:46.610
'cause this
is a great moment, Bonnie.

40:46.644 --> 40:49.313
I want you to see
nothing's being switched,

40:49.346 --> 40:50.648
nothing's being changed.

40:50.681 --> 40:54.819
There on the end of my tool
is your ring.

40:54.852 --> 40:56.787
Now, Bonnie,
take a hold of that.

40:56.821 --> 40:58.856
Don't put it on
your finger yet, but take it.

40:58.889 --> 41:02.960
Because Bonnie, I have a very
special gift for you, Bonnie,

41:02.993 --> 41:04.728
- [inaudible]
- A very special gift.

41:04.762 --> 41:07.164
I have, first of all,
a Wet-Nap

41:07.198 --> 41:09.099
so you will not be stinking
of watermelon

41:09.133 --> 41:10.568
for the rest of the night.
- [laughing] Thank you.

41:10.601 --> 41:15.139
- I also have a bowl here
to make a nice fruit salad.

41:15.172 --> 41:17.107
- Yes.
- We have a spork,

41:17.141 --> 41:20.077
and a little umbrella,

41:20.110 --> 41:22.313
and to make it really classy,

41:22.346 --> 41:25.983
we have your ring there,
Bonnie.

41:26.016 --> 41:27.818
There you go, Bonnie.
- That's awesome, thank you.

41:27.852 --> 41:29.086
- Your watermelon, your ring.
- Amazing.

41:29.119 --> 41:30.754
- What a good idea,
buying that ring.

41:30.788 --> 41:32.289
- Wow.
- That's Bonnie there.

41:32.323 --> 41:34.725
Bonnie with the watermelon.

41:39.230 --> 41:40.498
- We've run out of time,

41:40.531 --> 41:43.434
but we haven't run out
of fantastic magic.

41:43.467 --> 41:45.503
We'll be back
with another great episode

41:45.536 --> 41:47.171
of "Fool Us" next week.

41:47.204 --> 41:48.639
See you then.

41:48.672 --> 41:51.709
[cheers and applause]
