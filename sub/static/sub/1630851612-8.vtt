03:59.440 --> 04:03.308
In my last performance,
I felt a lot of unexpected love.

04:03.377 --> 04:06.345
And really what I wanna do with
music at the end of the day

04:06.480 --> 04:07.779
is connect
with the song emotionally

04:07.915 --> 04:10.749

in that space together.

04:10.818 --> 04:12.618
Alanis: Nice.

04:14.154 --> 04:16.021
'cause that's
the big question, right?

04:16.090 --> 04:17.656

how to merge the humanity

04:17.791 --> 04:20.659
with the alter ego
evolved technology,

04:20.728 --> 04:22.461
and you're the guinea pigs
in this moment.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.930
And I am excited
for another opportunity

04:25.065 --> 04:26.898

Tonight I think
it's full of luster,

You seem so self-assured

like you need an alter ego.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.431
My whole life,

08:19.500 --> 08:21.867
I've been told that I've got
a voice made for performance,

08:21.935 --> 08:23.502
a voice made for the stage,

08:23.637 --> 08:25.971
but there's something
about how the face
doesn't match the voice

08:26.106 --> 08:27.672
- and vice-versa.
- Ugh, I don't like that.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.007

08:29.142 --> 08:32.043

I'm here right now

08:32.145 --> 08:34.713
and what used to be
a liability is an asset,

08:34.781 --> 08:37.816

with gratitude for it.

08:37.951 --> 08:40.552
Well said, man. Well said.

08:40.621 --> 08:43.421
You've really embodied
your alter ego.

orlando deville blew us away

10:16.583 --> 10:17.749
with his performance.

10:19.553 --> 10:23.355
But was it enough to secure
a spot in the semi-finals?

10:23.423 --> 10:26.024
There's one person
standing in his way,

10:26.159 --> 10:28.226
and now it's time to see
that person perform.

10:28.295 --> 10:31.162

let me show a lot of love
to the musicians,

13:54.634 --> 13:57.869
adam blackstone
and the alter ego band.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.139
Alanis, what did you think?

14:01.208 --> 14:02.941
Alanis: For you
to keep us on our toes

14:03.076 --> 14:06.110
and perform a song
that was a surprise

14:06.179 --> 14:08.446
and then the arrangement
of that song being a surprise
was a boon.

14:08.582 --> 14:10.849
- Awesome.
- You have the capability

14:10.984 --> 14:13.718
vocally to perform
all kinds of genres,

14:13.787 --> 14:17.021
and what's the through line that
went through both your songs?

14:17.157 --> 14:18.690
Yeah, right now, I feel like
the through line

14:18.825 --> 14:21.092
is my emotional connection
to the song.

14:21.228 --> 14:24.229
- Yeah, I get that.
- Right? And maybe
there needs to be more.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.798
- Again--
- nope, the through line
is kingston sol.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.399
Oh, thank you so much,
will.I.Am.

14:28.468 --> 14:31.269
I was gonna say
I don't feel like there
should be, personally.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.504
I feel like we need to start
freeing each other up

14:33.640 --> 14:35.940
to, like, be the artist
that we wanna be,

14:36.076 --> 14:38.343
and this has been
an incredible journey thus far,

14:38.478 --> 14:41.079
and I hope I get to stay
and experiment some more.

14:44.484 --> 14:48.019
Grimes, what did you think
of his performance here
for you tonight?

14:48.154 --> 14:49.387
I thought it was good.

14:49.456 --> 14:53.691
I don't know if you did better
than your audition,

14:53.760 --> 14:56.227
but either way, I'm very
intrigued by you as an artist.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.096
I appreciate that, ma'am.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.064
Will.I.Am: I like
what you're dishing out.

15:00.200 --> 15:03.501
You took me for another ride
because I thought you were gonna
stay in that soul box,

15:03.637 --> 15:06.037
but now you took me
on a folk pop ride,

15:06.139 --> 15:08.606
and that is entertainment.

15:08.742 --> 15:11.309
And you have that, so thank you
for tonight's performance.

15:11.378 --> 15:12.777
Aw, thanks so much, man.

15:14.514 --> 15:18.016
Your style is really, really
kind of this cool,

15:18.151 --> 15:20.952
unique, laid back, um...

15:21.021 --> 15:23.354
I just picture myself
almost on a beach,
you know what I mean?

15:23.423 --> 15:25.456
- Yeah, man.
- Shaka.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.191
But if I'm being
completely honest,

15:27.260 --> 15:29.527
I didn't like
tonight's performance

15:29.663 --> 15:32.230
as much
as I thought I wanted to.

15:32.299 --> 15:34.832
Something about
your first performance

15:34.868 --> 15:36.200
that just sucked me in
and wouldn't let me go.

15:36.269 --> 15:40.338
And I didn't quite feel
that same level of investment.

15:40.473 --> 15:41.873
All that being said,

15:41.942 --> 15:44.475
what do you love
about being kingston sol?

15:44.544 --> 15:46.444
What I love about
being kingston sol

15:46.513 --> 15:48.413
is it takes away
all the prejudice,

15:48.548 --> 15:50.481
and I think what's happening,
it's freeing me up

15:50.550 --> 15:52.784
to realize maybe some
of the things I believe,

15:52.919 --> 15:56.154
like, the world is against me,
is actually just a lie.

16:00.427 --> 16:05.063
Trust me when I tell you
that everyone in this room
is all for you.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.898
We love you
and we're here to support you.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.032
Yeah, man! Love you, guys.

16:08.101 --> 16:10.735
Rocsi: Come on,
give it up for kingston sol.

16:12.138 --> 16:13.571
What if they weren't human,

16:13.707 --> 16:16.140
so we could just eliminate them
without feeling bad?

16:16.209 --> 16:17.342
- Yes.
- Like, if it was just a game--

16:17.477 --> 16:19.177
a video game.
They just dissolve into dust.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.346
Or a cartoon or something?
It's, like, "okay, bye."

16:21.414 --> 16:26.384
rocsi:<i> Kingston sol</i>
<i> or orlando deville has to</i>
<i> go home tonight.</i>

16:26.519 --> 16:28.453
<i>You'll find out who after this.</i>

16:31.291 --> 16:33.992
Announcer:
<i> Let's find out who's heading</i>
<i>to the semi-finals next week.</i>

16:34.160 --> 16:36.094
<i> Results in three, two, one.</i>

16:40.300 --> 16:42.066
Rocsi:
Welcome back to "alter ego."

16:42.135 --> 16:44.869
we're about to find out
which alter ego

16:44.938 --> 16:49.040
from this head-to-head match-up
will be put on the diamond,

16:49.109 --> 16:51.776
sending them through
to the next round,

16:51.911 --> 16:54.545
and which one will,
sadly, head home,

16:54.647 --> 16:58.883
revealing their true identity
to the judges in this process.

16:58.952 --> 17:01.652
Judges, it's time for you
to make your decision.

17:04.891 --> 17:07.892
- Grimes?
- So, orlando, I think

17:07.961 --> 17:10.228
you're an incredible singer,
but for me,

17:10.296 --> 17:12.530
at this point right now
in the competition,

17:12.665 --> 17:14.699
I'm sort of thinking less
about singing

17:14.834 --> 17:17.502
and more kind of about
the holistic artist package.

17:17.637 --> 17:20.271
For that reason,
kingston to me right now

17:20.340 --> 17:23.341
is just sort of feeling more
like an artist I connect to,

17:23.476 --> 17:27.311
and I would put kingston sol
on the diamond.

17:30.183 --> 17:32.183
That is one vote for kingston.

17:32.318 --> 17:34.185
Both of you guys
are extremely talented,

17:34.320 --> 17:37.588
but, kingston sol,
I like the risks you take.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.857
You definitely have everything

17:39.993 --> 17:42.794
that it takes to be the next
generation of a superstar.

17:42.862 --> 17:47.598
And the person that
I wanna put through

17:47.700 --> 17:49.434
is kingston sol.

17:54.274 --> 17:57.775
So that is currently
two votes for kingston sol.

17:57.911 --> 18:00.044
Nick?

18:00.146 --> 18:04.949
Kingston sol,
I was wanting to see
a little bit more growth.

18:05.018 --> 18:07.418
Orlando, I feel like
you really rose to the occasion

18:07.554 --> 18:10.421
and you came in tonight,
and I thought put on
a great show.

18:10.490 --> 18:14.192
And to me, orlando
was the stronger tonight,

18:14.260 --> 18:16.561
and orlando deserves to move on.

18:20.500 --> 18:24.035
So that's two votes
for kingston sol,

18:24.104 --> 18:27.338
and one vote
for orlando deville.

18:27.474 --> 18:28.873
If there is a tie,

18:28.942 --> 18:31.175
it will go to the audience
to decide.

18:31.311 --> 18:34.011
- Alanis?
- Kingston sol,
I actually liked

18:34.147 --> 18:36.848
your first performance
better than this second one.

18:37.016 --> 18:38.850
Orlando,
I was very much blown away

18:38.985 --> 18:41.352
by how you're
an incredible showman.

18:41.421 --> 18:43.221
And it went to the next level
of showmanship--

18:43.289 --> 18:44.822
show-person-ship--

18:44.958 --> 18:47.992
'cause I actually don't know
if you're a man.

18:48.061 --> 18:50.528
So, it is for this reason
that I am gonna ask

18:50.663 --> 18:53.431
ask orlando deville
to go on the diamond.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.666
I'm gonna make this a tie.

18:57.704 --> 19:01.105
The judges votes are tied.

19:03.109 --> 19:05.843
Audience, get ready,
because you guys are gonna vote

19:05.979 --> 19:07.945
who gets the spot on
the diamond--

19:08.014 --> 19:10.381
kingston sol
or orlando deville?

19:10.450 --> 19:12.216
Please vote now.

19:15.522 --> 19:17.788
Well, they're probably going to
vote for orlando, I guess.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.524
- I don't know.
- Announcer:<i> Okay,</i>
<i> here it comes.</i>

19:19.659 --> 19:21.826
Announcer #2:
<i> Great. So, audience...</i>

19:21.895 --> 19:24.896
No matter what happens,
no matter how this vote goes,

19:24.964 --> 19:28.499
and I mean this
from the bottom of my heart,
I love you, brother.

19:28.635 --> 19:29.634
No matter what happens,
I'm really, really proud of us.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.369
- Me, too, man.
- Yeah.

19:31.504 --> 19:34.105
Rocsi: The studio audience
has voted for...

19:38.978 --> 19:42.146
...Orlando deville to move on
to the semi-finals.

19:48.154 --> 19:52.023
Congratulations,
orlando deville,

19:52.158 --> 19:56.227
the audience has voted
to put you onto that diamond.

19:57.864 --> 20:01.666
That means that
you're guaranteed a place
in the next round.

20:01.801 --> 20:04.802
We will see you
in the semi-final.

20:07.407 --> 20:11.342
Unfortunately, kingston sol--
my care bear.

20:11.477 --> 20:12.510
I don't want him to go.

20:12.645 --> 20:15.012
Would you please
do us the honor,

20:15.148 --> 20:17.014
perform one last time,

20:17.150 --> 20:21.852
and finally reveal your
true identity to the judges?

20:21.988 --> 20:23.854
It would be
my complete honor. Yep.

20:23.990 --> 20:26.991
What could
kingston sol look like

and the secret no longer
needs to be kept,
where are you from?

22:05.425 --> 22:07.425
Yeah, I was born and raised in
orange county, california,

22:07.560 --> 22:10.928
but my parents immigrated here
in the '70s from south korea.

22:11.064 --> 22:14.398
Awesome.

22:14.500 --> 22:17.902
What do you think
you're gonna take away from
this alter ego experience?

22:18.037 --> 22:21.339
So, I grew up in the '90s,
so, will.I.Am, alanis--

22:21.474 --> 22:24.342
nick, particularly--
I grew up listening to you guys.

22:24.477 --> 22:26.711
But I when I listened
to the radio, nobody looked
like me on the radio.

22:26.779 --> 22:32.550
And so part
of the journey for me
on this show really is this.

22:32.685 --> 22:36.187
I would love, love,
love just to show the world

22:36.322 --> 22:38.723
that asian-americans
have a place

22:38.791 --> 22:40.958
in the space of music
and creativity.

22:42.428 --> 22:44.061
Yeah!

22:48.201 --> 22:49.834
Please, give it up
one more time for james,
ladies and gentlemen!

22:49.902 --> 22:51.969
James!

22:53.606 --> 22:56.040
Two of my favorite alter egos
are facing off

22:56.109 --> 22:57.341
right after this break.

22:57.477 --> 22:59.543
It's st. Luna
and night journey.

22:59.679 --> 23:01.379
They'll be going head-to-head

23:01.447 --> 23:04.782
for the last spot
in the semi-finals
right after this.

23:15.027 --> 23:18.229
Welcome back to "alter ego."
I am rocsi diaz.

23:18.297 --> 23:21.265
It's the last night
of our head-to-head round.

23:21.401 --> 23:25.202
Obviously, it's important
for the singers to embody
their alter ego character,

23:25.271 --> 23:27.071
but what does that really mean
for you?

23:27.206 --> 23:30.074
We're looking for
a next generation superstar.

23:30.143 --> 23:34.545
So, for me it means
when you're watching
that performance happen,

23:34.680 --> 23:37.748
they're completely one
with their alter ego--

23:37.784 --> 23:42.186
voice, body, it's all one
synchronized moment

23:42.321 --> 23:44.021
that doesn't take you for
one second to think,

23:44.157 --> 23:46.957
"wait a minute,
who is behind that alter ego?"

23:49.462 --> 23:51.395
now I hope you're ready

23:51.464 --> 23:54.465
for our second
head-to-head tonight.

23:55.435 --> 23:58.068
It's st. Luna
and night journey.

24:01.340 --> 24:03.140
Night journey versus st. Luna.

24:03.209 --> 24:06.944

24:32.004 --> 24:34.905
due to the fact that
their body will never die.

24:34.974 --> 24:37.107
Their avatar could live
10,000 years into the future.

Hi, night journey.
Hi, st. Luna.

24:53.593 --> 24:56.427
How have you been since the
audition time for both of you?

24:56.562 --> 24:57.862
I've been feeling really good.

24:57.997 --> 25:00.397
I've been getting to know
my character,

25:00.466 --> 25:02.032
myself a little bit better.

25:02.101 --> 25:03.300
I'm singing a song this week

25:03.436 --> 25:05.135
that was really
a challenge for me,

25:05.271 --> 25:07.238
so I'm ready to share it!

25:08.774 --> 25:11.008
Obviously, I'm here to win,

25:11.143 --> 25:12.877
but the main goal
is to make sure

25:12.945 --> 25:15.179
that everybody feels what I feel
when I'm singing a song,

25:15.314 --> 25:16.981
because music is empathy to me.

25:18.618 --> 25:21.752
Do you feel like
you're kind of becoming one
with your alter ego?

25:21.821 --> 25:24.955
I feel like I'm becoming one
with my alter ego 100%.

25:25.024 --> 25:28.592
I've become such a confident
person because of night journey.

25:28.661 --> 25:31.061
Nick: So, st. Luna,
it is head-to-head,

25:31.130 --> 25:34.064
and does that bring out
your best performance
being in this kind of situation?

25:34.133 --> 25:35.399
St. Luna:
I am a competitor.

25:35.468 --> 25:37.535
I always wanna top
my last performance.

25:37.670 --> 25:40.871
This week I had to get
really competitive
to try and up my game

25:40.940 --> 25:43.140
and make sure I was making
the song sound good.

25:44.911 --> 25:46.644
St. Luna, you're up first.

25:46.712 --> 25:48.579

Judges, I am dying to know
what you guys think.

28:44.290 --> 28:45.389
Nick, I'll start with you.

28:45.458 --> 28:47.958
There's no rules
in music anymore.

28:48.027 --> 28:49.093
I mean, it's wide open.

28:49.228 --> 28:52.396
So, this show and what
we're experiencing here,

28:52.465 --> 28:54.832
there's no reason why
you couldn't take that
out on the road

28:55.000 --> 28:56.333
and see that live
in a concert.

28:56.469 --> 28:58.402
There's nothing about
her performance to me

28:58.471 --> 29:00.504
that took you out of it at all.

29:00.639 --> 29:04.441
I mean, the whole vibe
is just one great package
we're watching right now.

29:06.445 --> 29:08.545
Thank you very much.
I appreciate that.

29:08.614 --> 29:10.080
Will.I.Am?

29:10.216 --> 29:12.683
You definitely have
everything that it takes

29:12.818 --> 29:15.686
to be the next generation
of a superstar.

29:15.821 --> 29:17.688
Visually, it's there.

29:17.823 --> 29:19.656
Her talent, the confidence...

29:19.792 --> 29:21.658
- Yeah!
- Thank you!

29:21.827 --> 29:23.227
Rocsi: Alanis?

29:23.295 --> 29:26.497
I haven't really wrapped
my whole self around

29:26.632 --> 29:29.099
what your alter ego is
and what you are...

29:29.235 --> 29:30.367
Me either.

29:31.504 --> 29:32.870
You know, so for me,
the performance,

29:32.938 --> 29:36.140
I didn't feel
this emotional connection.

29:36.275 --> 29:39.943
And this show is all about
embracing your alter ego,

29:40.012 --> 29:42.980
and it's really up
to the human backstage--

29:43.115 --> 29:46.717
you know, it's all on you
to show us how that looks.

29:46.786 --> 29:48.819
So, grimes, what did you think
of her performance?

29:48.954 --> 29:51.388
Is this is somebody you're
gonna go check out in concert?

29:51.457 --> 29:53.557
Did you connect
with her alter ego?

29:53.626 --> 29:55.025
Grimes:
Yeah, I mean, for me,

29:55.127 --> 29:56.693
you're one of
the strongest performers

29:56.829 --> 29:57.928
in the whole competition.

30:00.032 --> 30:02.766
Also, like, your vibe
is very chill and cool.

30:02.868 --> 30:04.468
I don't know.
I would, like, hang out
with you or something.

30:04.603 --> 30:08.839
I feel like when
I'm looking at it,
everything feels there.

30:10.743 --> 30:15.712
St. Luna was the judges'
favorite of her audition group
in round one.

30:15.781 --> 30:19.783
But was that performance enough
to win them over again

30:19.919 --> 30:23.387
<i> or will night journey</i>
<i>be the one to secure the spot</i>
<i> in the semi-finals?</i>

30:23.455 --> 30:25.322
<i>You're watching "alter ego,"</i>
<i> the head-to-heads.</i>

30:25.391 --> 30:26.557
<i> We'll be right back.</i>

30:34.900 --> 30:37.234
Announcer:
<i>Night journey is in position.</i>

30:37.303 --> 30:40.504
<i> Over to rocsi</i>
<i> in three, two, one.</i>

30:40.639 --> 30:43.540
Welcome back to "alter ego."
I'm rocsi diaz.

30:43.676 --> 30:46.476
We just saw st. Luna's
head-to-head performance,

30:46.545 --> 30:50.914
and the panel was split
on whether she really became
her alter ego.

30:50.983 --> 30:53.784
Will it be enough to move on
to the semi-finals?

30:53.919 --> 30:57.754
That all depends on what
our next alter ego can bring
to the stage tonight--

30:57.823 --> 30:59.756
night journey.

31:01.460 --> 31:03.861
Yeah, that was
my favorite performance
of the whole competition.

31:03.996 --> 31:06.463
Girl, don't make me cry
right now.

31:06.599 --> 31:10.667
During the audition round,
it was nice having night journey
as a performer for me

31:10.803 --> 31:13.871
because I didn't have to worry
about people judging me.

31:13.939 --> 31:15.839
<i> I feel like I need</i>
<i> this alter ego</i>

31:15.908 --> 31:17.040
<i> because it doesn't matter</i>

31:17.109 --> 31:18.642
<i> who you are</i>
<i> or what you look like.</i>

31:18.711 --> 31:21.078
She gives me an opportunity
to be a singer,

31:21.146 --> 31:24.615
<i> and I might be able</i>
<i> to be the next digital</i>
<i> superstar because of her.</i>

31:26.418 --> 31:29.253
My mom is gonna be
in the audience for
the head-to-head round,

31:29.388 --> 31:32.189
<i> my mom and my grandma,</i>
<i> two of the women who</i>
<i> I've always looked up to.</i>

31:33.792 --> 31:35.459
<i> My mom is</i>
<i> my biggest role model.</i>

31:35.628 --> 31:37.561
<i> She grew up a single mom,</i>

31:37.630 --> 31:39.897
so she's been through the dark,

31:40.032 --> 31:42.666
<i> and she came out shining.</i>

31:42.801 --> 31:45.435
<i> She's always told me that I</i>
<i> was capable of doing anything.</i>

31:47.506 --> 31:51.241
I definitely feel like
I have to step up my game
going against st. Luna.

31:51.310 --> 31:54.111
<i> Her tone was so beautiful</i>
<i> and steady,</i>

31:54.246 --> 31:56.346
this, like, powerful,
beautiful voice.

31:56.482 --> 31:59.850
Only one of us will be able to
move on to the semi-finals.

31:59.919 --> 32:01.752
( vocalizing )

32:01.820 --> 32:03.553
and so night journey
is gonna go out there,

32:03.622 --> 32:04.554
and she's gonna do
what she does best.

32:04.623 --> 32:05.856
I think she's gonna shine.

32:08.861 --> 32:09.860

33:44.990 --> 33:46.790
♪ to get to you

33:56.235 --> 33:57.367
like, I think the voice--

33:57.436 --> 33:58.668
I like the slight messiness
in the voice

33:58.804 --> 34:00.170
in exchange
for more character.

34:00.239 --> 34:01.838
- Yes.
- Yeah.

34:01.907 --> 34:04.941
Crowd: Night journey!
Night journey! Night journey!

34:05.010 --> 34:07.144
Rocsi: Soak it up, mama.
Soak it up.

34:08.781 --> 34:13.517
Judges, was that performance
worthy of a spot
in the semi-finals?

34:13.585 --> 34:14.951
Is night journey
the full package?

34:15.020 --> 34:16.853
Image, personality and talent?

34:16.989 --> 34:18.355
Grimes, I'll go to you first.

34:18.424 --> 34:21.191
I may be biased,

34:21.260 --> 34:24.061
but you're my favorite
contestant generally.

34:24.196 --> 34:27.230
Oh, my god.
That means so much to me.
Thank you.

34:27.299 --> 34:29.332
For me, like,
what I favor in a singer

34:29.468 --> 34:31.034
is always gonna be character
in the voice.

34:31.103 --> 34:34.204
And, like, I kinda like when
your voice isn't always perfect.

34:34.273 --> 34:36.373
I like that
it just sounds very unique,

34:36.508 --> 34:38.175
and I just am a firm believer
in auto-tune.

34:38.310 --> 34:41.778
What matters now
is creative decisions
that are interesting.

34:41.914 --> 34:44.514
I like that you seem sort of shy
and brave at the same time.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.550
Like, what is it?
Antisocial extrovert-ish?

34:46.618 --> 34:49.619
Antisocial extrovert. Uh-huh.
Kendrick lamar said it first.

34:49.755 --> 34:53.457
He did? Okay. Sick.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.025
Um, yeah,
I'm just a huge fan.

34:55.160 --> 34:57.427
- I think you should win,
and I liked the song.
- Whoa.

34:57.563 --> 35:02.499
- Thank you so much, grimes.
- Alanis, what did you think?

35:02.634 --> 35:04.768
You are a great example to me

35:04.903 --> 35:07.137
of all the pieces of the puzzle
coming together.

35:07.272 --> 35:09.473
Just a big fan of your whole
overall package.

35:09.541 --> 35:12.676
Thank you.

35:12.744 --> 35:14.978
Will.I.Am, what did you think
of her performance?

35:15.114 --> 35:17.214
I thought the performance
was stellar.

35:17.349 --> 35:19.216
You brought vulnerability
to the show.

35:19.351 --> 35:21.518
You weren't trying
to be perfect,

35:21.587 --> 35:23.687
you were just trying
to relay the emotion.

35:23.822 --> 35:26.623
And a lot of people
cover their emotions up.

35:26.692 --> 35:29.860
They go on social media
and they do this, "hee-hee."

35:29.995 --> 35:31.061
( imitates crying )

35:31.196 --> 35:33.230
- you know?
- Not uncommon.

35:33.298 --> 35:35.065
And I didn't get that
from your performance,

35:35.200 --> 35:38.068
- even through an alter ego.
- Thank you so much.

35:38.203 --> 35:39.803
So you're connecting
emotionally.

35:42.774 --> 35:44.040
Night journey:
Thank you. That was my goal.

35:44.109 --> 35:47.711
Because as night journey,
I wanted to be an example

35:47.779 --> 35:51.148
of the journey that
we go through in the night
when nobody else sees it.

35:51.283 --> 35:56.153
I so wanted to be able to be
a symbol of something dark
that's also light.

35:57.756 --> 36:00.223
You're alter ego to me
is very mysterious.

36:00.359 --> 36:03.460
And what makes
a next generation superstar

36:03.529 --> 36:06.062
is intrigue,
mystery, excitement.

36:06.131 --> 36:09.499
It's all the things coming
together with a great voice

36:09.635 --> 36:12.302
that keep us captivated and
keep us wanting to see more,

36:12.437 --> 36:13.670
and you have all those things,
so great job.

36:13.739 --> 36:15.705
Thank you so much.

36:15.774 --> 36:18.175
Rocsi: Night journey
took us for a ride
with that performance,

36:18.310 --> 36:21.077
but will st. Luna
take the diamond once again?

36:21.146 --> 36:23.380
It's the last night
of the head-to-heads,

36:23.448 --> 36:26.283
and there's only one spot left
in the semi-finals.

36:26.385 --> 36:28.451
We'll find out later
who the judges think

36:28.587 --> 36:31.087
deserves that spot
in the semi-finals,

36:31.223 --> 36:35.225
but not before coming out here
and meeting them in person.

36:35.294 --> 36:38.094
I don't know how
we're gonna pick another
winner from this one.

36:38.230 --> 36:40.830
- One, everybody sings awesome.
- I know. That's the problem.

36:40.899 --> 36:43.500
- Two--
- if you could be less talented,
that would be really helpful.

36:43.635 --> 36:45.835
I'm so excited for her
and proud of her.

36:45.904 --> 36:47.470
Oh!

36:55.314 --> 36:57.547
Announcer:
<i> Last results of the night.</i>
<i> Here we go.</i>

37:02.821 --> 37:03.853
Welcome back to "alter ego."

37:03.989 --> 37:06.223
it's time for the judges to vote

37:06.291 --> 37:09.226
for who they'll send
to the diamond,

37:09.294 --> 37:13.063
which will guarantee them
the last spot in the semi-finals
that start next week.

37:13.131 --> 37:15.966
Judges, it's time
to cast your votes.

37:20.105 --> 37:24.174
It all boils down to this.
Who are you more of a fan of?

37:24.309 --> 37:25.976
Who would you
go see in concert?

37:26.111 --> 37:30.146
Is it st. Luna
or night journey?

37:30.215 --> 37:34.017
( cheering )

37:34.152 --> 37:36.219
y'all are passionate.

37:38.290 --> 37:42.792
Nick, which one
of these performers
is the full package?

37:42.861 --> 37:47.530
Night journey, you have
such a cool, unique voice.

37:47.666 --> 37:49.633
- It sucks you in.
- Thank you so much.

37:49.701 --> 37:52.335
Yeah, and you've done
a great job of stepping
into your alter ego

37:52.471 --> 37:55.505
and bringing night journey
to life.

37:57.309 --> 38:01.544
For me, the voice
that just moves me

38:01.613 --> 38:04.381
a smidge more is st. Luna.

38:04.449 --> 38:08.018
So I'd like to see st. Luna
on the diamond.

38:08.153 --> 38:09.119
Thank you very much.

38:10.255 --> 38:13.823
That is one vote for st. Luna.
Grimes?

38:13.892 --> 38:16.693
For me, st. Luna,
you have real pop star energy,

38:16.828 --> 38:19.829
which I think not everybody
in this competition has.

38:19.898 --> 38:22.332
But then, night journey,
something about her
just adds up to me.

38:22.467 --> 38:23.533
Like,
I just feel the character.

38:23.669 --> 38:27.370
I'm going to choose
night journey.

38:27.506 --> 38:29.739
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

38:29.808 --> 38:32.175
It's one and one right now.
Alanis?

38:32.311 --> 38:36.613
St. Luna, I love your voice.
You were born to do this.

38:36.748 --> 38:41.551
Night journey,
I'm really enrolled
in your whole approach

38:41.620 --> 38:45.188
and the whole cohesiveness
of your vocal and your movement.

38:45.257 --> 38:48.858
And I'm also a bit of a sucker
for knowing

38:48.994 --> 38:51.227
that this
next digital superstar

38:51.296 --> 38:52.696
is going to be
in the public eye

38:52.831 --> 38:54.230
and influencing
a lot of people.

38:54.299 --> 38:56.866
So it's worthy for us
to chase wholeness more,

38:56.935 --> 38:58.935
which includes
embracing the dark.

38:59.071 --> 39:03.239
I'm gonna bring night journey
onto that diamond.

39:03.375 --> 39:04.941
Thank you so much.

39:08.847 --> 39:13.216
That is two votes
for night journey,
one vote for st. Luna.

39:13.352 --> 39:15.685
Will, it is all up to you.

39:15.821 --> 39:19.456
So, st. Luna said something
that didn't gel well,

39:19.524 --> 39:21.725
and that's,
"I'm getting to know
my alter ego."

39:21.860 --> 39:25.428
every time night journey speaks,
she's night journey.

39:26.665 --> 39:29.065
She didn't give any illusion

39:29.167 --> 39:31.701
that she was getting to know
the persona.

39:33.105 --> 39:35.338
Um, and although I drew

39:35.474 --> 39:39.075
my little st. Luna,

39:39.144 --> 39:40.343
I scribbled my night journey

39:40.412 --> 39:41.878
because that's who I want
to put on the diamond.

39:41.947 --> 39:45.615
Thank you so much!
Thank you!

39:47.786 --> 39:51.221
And there you have it.
Congratulations, night journey!

39:51.356 --> 39:55.225
- Thank you so much.
- You've won the spot
on the diamond.

39:55.293 --> 39:56.993
Go ahead and head on up there.

39:58.830 --> 40:02.532
Night journey,
you've also secured a place
in our semi-finals.

40:02.667 --> 40:06.469
Sadly, st. Luna,
that means we have to

40:06.605 --> 40:09.038
say goodbye to you tonight.

40:09.107 --> 40:12.242
But before you go,
we'd love to hear you sing
one last time

40:12.310 --> 40:16.012
and come out at here as yourself
to meet the judges in person.

40:16.148 --> 40:17.947
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

40:18.083 --> 40:20.183
Get loud one last time
for st. Luna!

40:22.454 --> 40:23.987
What do we think
st. Luna's gonna look like?

40:24.055 --> 40:27.390
I feel like she's a popular--
I feel like she's, like, cool.

40:27.526 --> 40:30.860
- Katy perry-esque?
- I have no clue.

42:02.587 --> 42:04.821
Wow. Everyone,
please meet sarah,

42:04.890 --> 42:09.459
- aka st. Luna.
- Hi, everyone.

42:09.528 --> 42:12.462
Do you do this for a living?
Do you sing regularly?

42:12.564 --> 42:17.934
- I mean, do you make--
- I just graduated from ucla,
like, a couple months ago.

42:18.069 --> 42:22.438
Go, bruins! I got my degree
in human biology and society,

42:22.507 --> 42:23.873
so I do not have a music degree.

42:23.942 --> 42:27.043
My life has always sort of been
the scientific part of me

42:27.112 --> 42:28.711
and the music part of me,

42:28.780 --> 42:31.347
and I have kept trying to,
like, make the decision

42:31.483 --> 42:32.849
of which path
I wanted to take.

42:32.918 --> 42:34.684
And every time
I choose one path,
the world kind of...

42:34.753 --> 42:38.221
- The other one calls, yes.
- ...Pushes me into
the other one, so--

42:38.356 --> 42:41.858
well, I'm sure the world
of science needs you...

42:41.993 --> 42:44.227
- Yeah, I hope so.
- ...But it'd shame
if the world of music

42:44.296 --> 42:45.862
didn't get to enjoy
what you have to offer,

42:45.997 --> 42:48.464
because you are
phenomenally talented.

42:48.600 --> 42:52.635
Everybody, sarah!

42:52.771 --> 42:54.671
Starting next week, those
alter egos will be competing

42:54.806 --> 42:58.207
in our semi-finals
for four spots in the finale,

42:58.276 --> 43:02.178
but there can only be one
next generation superstar.

43:02.314 --> 43:05.682
In a matter of weeks,
we'll find out who.

43:05.784 --> 43:07.550
I cannot believe it.

43:07.619 --> 43:11.754
It is getting as real as it
can get here on "alter ego."

43:11.823 --> 43:13.623
we'll see you next week
for the semi-finals.

43:13.692 --> 43:14.691
Good night.

43:18.863 --> 43:20.196
That's great.

43:20.265 --> 43:24.200
Rocsi:<i> The head-to-heads</i>
<i> have come to an end.</i>

43:24.269 --> 43:26.536
We have to say goodbye
to you tonight.

43:26.671 --> 43:27.670
This is a bring it
or go home round.

43:27.806 --> 43:30.506
- Godspeed.
-<i> ( music playing )</i>

43:30.642 --> 43:32.909

43:37.215 --> 43:39.882
<i> More identities</i>
<i> will be revealed.</i>

43:39.951 --> 43:41.217
It really breaks my heart
to say this,

43:41.353 --> 43:44.053
- but it is the end
of your journey.
- What?

43:44.189 --> 43:46.322
<i> Who will have what it takes</i>
<i> to make it to the finale?</i>

43:47.826 --> 43:50.159
