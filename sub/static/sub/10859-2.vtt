00:27.360 --> 00:29.000
We'll get done.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.040
No chance.

00:31.040 --> 00:33.000
This is brilliant.

00:35.280 --> 00:37.680
I gotta check this.
It's wicked for boarding.

00:41.200 --> 00:43.760
Come on then.

01:27.240 --> 01:28.960
Matt?

02:22.920 --> 02:26.280
I've been trying to trace
the origins of the Qilin.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.720
Also known as the Chinese Unicorn.
Exactly.

02:28.720 --> 02:32.400
The earliest reference was
in the 5th Century book Zuo Zhuan.

02:32.400 --> 02:35.640
I made a rough calculation
and put it into the matrix.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.360
I love this thing!

02:42.360 --> 02:44.920
Connor,

02:44.920 --> 02:49.440
if you touch that, you could change
the entire destiny of the universe.

02:50.680 --> 02:54.400
I'm not gonna touch it.
I'm just gonna... Good man.

02:54.400 --> 02:57.240
Whoa! Please tell me
this all means something.

02:58.720 --> 03:02.760
This is a 3D model
representing all known anomalies

03:02.760 --> 03:05.000
throughout history.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.160
All cultures have
their own mythical beasts

03:08.160 --> 03:11.360
like...the Loch Ness monster.

03:11.360 --> 03:14.440
My guess is where there's a myth
we'll find an anomaly.

03:14.440 --> 03:18.160
All we have to do
is date these myths accurately.

03:18.160 --> 03:20.920
Like a road map of time.

03:20.920 --> 03:25.840
Then we can start
to predict where and when

03:29.000 --> 03:32.480
new anomalies might start to open.

03:32.480 --> 03:36.840
Call me stupid, but couldn't we have
done all this on a computer?

03:36.840 --> 03:40.200
This way it's more tangible.

03:40.200 --> 03:43.640
It makes him feel more like God.
You know, the creation thing.

03:45.160 --> 03:47.280
Connor, you might be right.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.040
But unless I'm very much mistaken

03:52.040 --> 03:55.480
I think we may have made
our first prediction.

04:05.560 --> 04:10.520
All right. Listen up. We've
analysed the most recent anomalies

04:10.520 --> 04:12.600
and put them into the model.

04:12.600 --> 04:16.560
The prediction is specific
and local, but there's a problem.

04:16.560 --> 04:19.720
It could happen tomorrow
or many years from now.

04:19.720 --> 04:24.560
Check it out,
and take Sid and Nancy with you.

04:27.440 --> 04:30.120
I'll go, too.
No, I need you here.

04:30.120 --> 04:34.080
I should handle this. No, we'll go.
Anything happens, call me.

04:34.080 --> 04:36.440
Sarah.
Help!

04:36.440 --> 04:39.040
I've been taken hostage
by an obsessive scientist.

04:39.040 --> 04:41.720
Welcome to our world.

05:05.520 --> 05:07.480
This is the place.

05:10.640 --> 05:14.160
So this is where Cutter predicts
the anomaly will open.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.640
We'd better check it out.

05:18.640 --> 05:20.720
Then what?

05:20.720 --> 05:24.120
We sit twiddling our thumbs
till an anomaly appears?

05:24.120 --> 05:26.200
Something like that

05:26.200 --> 05:29.640
Hold me back! I don't think
I can take the excitement.

05:57.760 --> 05:59.840
Seems quiet enough.

06:17.280 --> 06:19.960
Connor!

06:19.960 --> 06:22.200
Window was open. Nobody in.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.320
What happened here?

06:31.320 --> 06:35.360
This place must be worth millions.

06:35.360 --> 06:37.400
Why's it just been left?

06:37.400 --> 06:40.880
The smell maybe. It stinks in here.

06:40.880 --> 06:43.760
Could be the sewers
or maybe some damp.

06:43.760 --> 06:46.240
It's more like
they've been keeping animals.

06:46.240 --> 06:49.560
What kind of animals? Skunks? Hey.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.960
Maybe the owners are abroad.
We'll keep watch for a while,

06:59.960 --> 07:03.480
but we can't stay indefinitely
just to satisfy Cutter's whims.

07:03.480 --> 07:05.880
You think he's wrong?
I think he's crazy,

07:05.880 --> 07:07.960
but not necessarily wrong.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.680
Seems like he's getting
beneath your skin.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.480
Abby.

07:16.440 --> 07:20.800
Have you ever been attracted to
somebody that you don't even like?

07:20.800 --> 07:23.000
I fall for the wrong men
all the time.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.960
One thing I do know

07:24.960 --> 07:28.960
if you're interested, don't wait
for the man to make the first move

07:28.960 --> 07:31.920
cos you could die of old age
before anything happens.

07:31.920 --> 07:35.800
You going to take your own advice?
Thinking about it.

08:30.160 --> 08:32.880
Hello?

08:38.080 --> 08:41.000
I'll call you back.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.280
Abby?

08:53.960 --> 08:55.920
Abby?

09:16.560 --> 09:18.480
Gotcha!

09:22.400 --> 09:24.480
That was childish.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.080
Were you scared?
No.

09:28.440 --> 09:30.400
A little bit.

09:36.800 --> 09:39.680
I thought you were in trouble.
Yeah.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.360
You came to rescue me.

09:43.680 --> 09:46.040
Thank you.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.920
You know, I like this place.

09:50.520 --> 09:53.080
It's fun.

09:53.080 --> 09:55.040
Yeah.

10:37.540 --> 10:39.500
I'm sorry.

10:44.540 --> 10:46.620
The Qilin.

10:46.620 --> 10:49.980
A magical creature
from 5th Century China.

10:49.980 --> 10:53.340
Amazing what people used to believe,
isn't it?

10:53.340 --> 10:55.660
Are you all right?
I'm fine. Thank you.

10:55.660 --> 10:57.620
Thanks.

11:11.780 --> 11:13.860
That was eventful!

11:13.860 --> 11:17.860
It's a nice place, isn't it? Care
to explain what you're doing here?

11:17.860 --> 11:21.100
Just visiting. The way I see it
you're either burglars

11:21.100 --> 11:23.100
or trespassers.

11:23.100 --> 11:25.500
Do we look like burglars to you?

11:25.500 --> 11:28.900
I'm pretty sure I've seen
laughing boy on a wanted poster.

11:28.900 --> 11:31.420
Are you talking about me?
Officer?

11:31.420 --> 11:33.420
Detective Constable Quinn. You are?

11:35.540 --> 11:37.780
We're property developers.

11:37.780 --> 11:40.100
You're lying. I should arrest you,

11:40.100 --> 11:42.460
but to be quite frank
I can't be bothered.

11:42.460 --> 11:45.060
You people aren't worth
the paperwork. Now go.

11:53.740 --> 11:56.060
What do you mean "you people"?

11:56.060 --> 11:58.020
Murder tourists.

11:59.100 --> 12:01.180
You make me sick. Now get out.

12:01.180 --> 12:04.380
If I see you here again,
your feet won't touch the ground.

12:04.380 --> 12:07.220
Come on.

12:08.980 --> 12:12.780
Can I just say that I think
the police do a fantastic job?

12:12.780 --> 12:14.980
The occasional lapse into cliche

12:14.980 --> 12:17.860
is understandable
in the circumstances.

12:19.700 --> 12:21.660
Connor.

12:33.380 --> 12:35.540
Something strange
is going on in there.

12:35.540 --> 12:38.900
Stay here. If anything out
of the ordinary happens, call us.

12:38.900 --> 12:41.540
Where are you going?
To get some answers.

12:41.540 --> 12:44.060
Connor, you're coming with me.

12:58.340 --> 13:01.500
Keep your head down
and don't look anyone in the face.

13:01.500 --> 13:04.300
Cutter's the only one
likely to recognise you,

13:04.300 --> 13:07.620
but if something does go wrong
you know what to do.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.580
Go.

13:19.260 --> 13:22.300
I'll call Maintenance.
That's Sector 8, isn't it?

13:55.860 --> 13:59.500
No-one gets in without a pass.
I had it in here when I left.

14:12.140 --> 14:14.740
It's not like
you don't know who I am.

14:14.740 --> 14:19.060
Sir, according to this Dr Page
entered the building 15 minutes ago.

14:31.900 --> 14:33.940
Close down the entrances.

14:33.940 --> 14:36.860
Don't move!

14:36.860 --> 14:39.260
Turn around slowly.

14:39.260 --> 14:42.420
Put your hands where I can see them.

14:42.420 --> 14:45.180
Drop your weapon
and get down on the ground now!

14:57.140 --> 14:59.740
I know this man.

15:02.940 --> 15:06.100
That's impossible.
Why?

15:10.980 --> 15:15.100
I watched him die in the Silurian
Desert millions of years ago.

15:24.940 --> 15:27.100
Clear.
Clear.

15:28.260 --> 15:31.300
Chief, have they reopened the case?
What case?

15:31.300 --> 15:35.020
I caught three government spooks
sniffing round the Brooks House.

15:35.020 --> 15:38.260
Not this again! They said
they were property developers,

15:38.260 --> 15:41.500
but their plate was from
a government vehicle. Leave it!

15:41.500 --> 15:44.140
The way I see it
they'll have another inquiry.

15:44.140 --> 15:48.100
You're losing your mind. I haven't
got time for this. Make time, sir.

15:54.820 --> 15:57.460
Because of your history
with that house

15:57.460 --> 16:01.020
I'll pretend you didn't speak
to a senior officer like that.

16:01.020 --> 16:03.860
Forget it, Danny. It's over.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.460
Not for me.

17:27.619 --> 17:29.780
Excuse me.

17:29.780 --> 17:32.260
Hello.
Hi. Hi.

17:32.260 --> 17:34.900
We had some questions
about a property. Which one?

17:34.900 --> 17:38.380
The abandoned house on the island.
You're interested?

17:38.380 --> 17:41.780
Yeah. We're looking,
aren't we, darling?

17:41.780 --> 17:44.180
Wondered why it hadn't sold yet.

17:44.180 --> 17:46.660
The market's been a bit soft.

17:46.660 --> 17:49.980
That's not the only reason.
Something happened there.

17:49.980 --> 17:52.780
You mean the kids?
Kids? Three of them.

17:52.780 --> 17:55.540
Local lads. They broke
into the house for a laugh.

17:55.540 --> 17:57.620
What happened?

17:57.620 --> 18:02.380
They disappeared. Not a trace
of them since - 14 years.

18:02.380 --> 18:04.860
There must be some explanation.

18:04.860 --> 18:08.180
Only one ever came out,
a boy called Ryan Mason.

18:08.180 --> 18:10.260
Mason?

18:10.260 --> 18:14.580
Yeah, Ryan Mason. Man, some people
say the place is still haunted.

18:14.580 --> 18:17.020
They hear screams, noises.

18:17.020 --> 18:20.780
If you're interested,
I can get you a killer deal now.

18:20.780 --> 18:23.300
We'll think about it.

18:23.300 --> 18:25.820
Better be quick.
Want to get rid of it soon.

18:25.820 --> 18:27.780
Thank you.

18:28.980 --> 18:31.780
Now what?
We need to track down Ryan Mason.

18:31.780 --> 18:34.420
I'll make a call.

18:59.620 --> 19:01.540
Hello?

19:02.620 --> 19:04.580
Who's there?

19:13.420 --> 19:15.940
Hello?

19:34.380 --> 19:37.500
Ryan?

19:38.660 --> 19:41.260
Ryan, can we talk to you?

19:43.500 --> 19:46.820
Ryan.
Just leave me alone.

19:46.820 --> 19:49.660
But you are Ryan Mason?
You ain't paid.

19:49.660 --> 19:53.260
I always fancied this job. We know
you didn't harm your friends.

19:56.900 --> 19:59.620
We just want to know
what happened in the house.

19:59.620 --> 20:01.580
Hello?

20:40.220 --> 20:43.740
Must've driven you crazy knowing
people thought you were a killer

20:43.740 --> 20:45.660
when you've done nothing wrong.

20:53.820 --> 20:56.420
I heard this terrible screaming.

21:21.100 --> 21:24.020
There was this light shining.

21:26.460 --> 21:28.620
It wasn't there before.
Was it flickering?

21:28.620 --> 21:30.580
How do you know?

21:35.940 --> 21:37.060
I just ran.

21:44.540 --> 21:46.500
Screaming.

21:48.900 --> 21:51.700
Like an animal.

21:57.660 --> 21:59.580
No animal I'd ever heard.

22:17.060 --> 22:20.380
Never saw my mates again.

22:20.380 --> 22:25.100
Look, this is my job.
Please, no-one here knows.

22:25.100 --> 22:29.660
We understand. You have nothing
to blame yourself for, Ryan.

22:29.660 --> 22:32.060
I've been back to the house
a thousand times

22:32.060 --> 22:34.620
and never once had the guts
to go back in.

22:35.660 --> 22:37.620
But I will.

22:46.660 --> 22:48.620
Come on.

23:18.640 --> 23:21.320
Abby!

23:21.320 --> 23:23.880
Abby.

23:23.880 --> 23:26.200
Abby.

23:26.200 --> 23:28.360
Hi.
Hi.

23:30.840 --> 23:32.800
I must have fallen.

23:35.200 --> 23:37.360
Let's get you up.

23:37.360 --> 23:39.800
Come on.

23:39.800 --> 23:42.440
Slowly, slowly.

23:42.440 --> 23:45.320
I'll just sit down.

23:45.320 --> 23:48.200
Abby, what happened?

23:48.200 --> 23:50.280
I was upstairs.

23:50.280 --> 23:52.640
I thought I saw someone
in the bedroom.

23:54.880 --> 23:56.880
I can't remember after that.

24:00.280 --> 24:02.360
We should get you to a doctor.

24:02.360 --> 24:04.880
OK. You stay here,
but wait outside.

24:10.400 --> 24:15.360
This guy was eaten by a giant
scorpion in the Silurian Desert.

24:15.360 --> 24:17.920
I'd say that makes him fairly dead.

24:17.920 --> 24:20.840
I didn't say it made sense.
All right.

24:21.920 --> 24:24.400
It's his identical twin.

24:24.400 --> 24:27.360
What's he doing here
going through my laundry?

24:29.280 --> 24:31.320
We killed his brother,

24:31.320 --> 24:33.400
so he steals your shirt.

24:33.400 --> 24:36.240
You said it yourself,
it doesn't make sense.

24:36.240 --> 24:39.000
There's another option: Helen.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.400
Maybe she had something to do
with it. She employed him before.

24:42.400 --> 24:45.280
So now she's brought him
back from the dead?

24:45.280 --> 24:48.800
That's scarier than I thought.
You can't even begin to guess.

24:48.800 --> 24:50.880
Rule number one:

24:50.880 --> 24:54.520
something inexplicable happens
Helen's usually behind it.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Trust me,

24:59.680 --> 25:01.880
she's back.

25:12.200 --> 25:14.880
Hi.

25:17.720 --> 25:19.720
OK.

25:23.480 --> 25:26.000
Where's my phone?

25:41.880 --> 25:44.160
No!

25:46.160 --> 25:48.840
You can't go inside.

25:52.600 --> 25:54.880
I won't tell anybody, if you don't.

26:25.720 --> 26:27.800
OK, phone.

26:29.520 --> 26:31.600
Ah! What are you doing?

26:31.600 --> 26:34.160
Arresting you
for breaking and entering.

26:35.240 --> 26:37.880
No, you can't do that.
That's a mistake.

26:37.880 --> 26:41.680
I can't leave this house.
Something bad might happen. What?

26:41.680 --> 26:43.640
Come on.

26:59.720 --> 27:01.720
You were warned.

27:10.560 --> 27:13.520
Never let a good commission go
without a fight.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.880
This is a blatant miscarriage
of justice.

27:31.960 --> 27:34.720
I demand habeas corpus.

27:37.560 --> 27:40.400
I would if I actually knew
what it meant.

27:40.400 --> 27:43.320
I know my rights.
Name them.

27:43.320 --> 27:45.480
You what?
Name them!

27:51.600 --> 27:54.920
Phonecall! I get a phonecall.

27:54.920 --> 27:59.400
Good lad.
And the right to remain silent.

27:59.400 --> 28:02.000
Well, you've lost that one,
haven't you?

28:04.760 --> 28:07.040
What is this?

28:07.040 --> 28:09.040
A police state?

28:09.040 --> 28:14.480
You can't take people's rights away
without asking them first.

28:14.480 --> 28:17.280
You're not funny.

28:19.960 --> 28:21.920
Please.

28:24.120 --> 28:27.120
You have to let me go.
I have to speak to my friends.

28:27.120 --> 28:30.640
Tell me what you were doing
at that house with your pals.

28:30.640 --> 28:33.080
I can't do that.

28:33.080 --> 28:37.160
You're not a property developer or
Oxbridge enough to be MI5, so what?

28:37.160 --> 28:39.720
One phonecall.

28:39.720 --> 28:41.720
I'll clear the whole thing up.

28:43.760 --> 28:45.720
Please.

28:47.400 --> 28:49.360
Is that a yeah or a no?

28:54.160 --> 28:56.160
Connor?

28:57.320 --> 28:59.160
What?!

29:00.680 --> 29:03.600
Oh, for heaven's sake.
I'm coming.

29:03.600 --> 29:06.160
Connor's in jail.

29:06.160 --> 29:09.200
OK, I'll stay here
and watch the house. Sure you're OK?

29:09.200 --> 29:12.720
It's fine. I slipped. That's all.
Honestly, go.

29:12.720 --> 29:15.720
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Give him my love.

30:52.280 --> 30:54.320
Hey.

30:54.320 --> 30:56.720
Hey!

31:57.160 --> 31:59.440
Don't be scared. It won't hurt us.

32:00.480 --> 32:05.040
I look after it. I feed it so it
doesn't eat Alfie or the other pets.

32:05.040 --> 32:08.400
Everyone here
pretends it's not real.

32:08.400 --> 32:10.440
But it is.

32:10.440 --> 32:13.120
I have to stop it from being bad.

32:13.120 --> 32:15.160
It's my job.

32:15.160 --> 32:17.120
It's OK, Emily.

32:19.240 --> 32:21.760
You can leave that to us now.

32:21.760 --> 32:23.720
OK?

32:31.920 --> 32:33.960
It lives in that house.

32:33.960 --> 32:36.000
Please don't go in there.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
Don't worry, I won't.

32:44.960 --> 32:47.040
Oh, my God. Thank you so much.

32:47.040 --> 32:51.200
Come here. It's so nice to see
a friend. It's been horrible.

32:51.200 --> 32:54.240
I've been going stir crazy.
You were only in a few hours.

32:54.240 --> 32:57.880
I'm not Nelson Mandela. It doesn't
mean I haven't suffered. Oi.

32:57.880 --> 33:00.440
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

33:00.440 --> 33:03.320
DC Quinn. I've come
to retrieve my colleague.

33:03.320 --> 33:06.800
You'd be well advised to stay
out of my way. And if I don't?

33:06.800 --> 33:09.560
It's for you.

33:09.560 --> 33:12.440
DC Quinn.

33:12.440 --> 33:15.200
No, sir. Of course not.

33:15.200 --> 33:17.240
Yes.

33:17.240 --> 33:19.720
Yes, sir. I'll do it right now.

33:19.720 --> 33:23.480
I hear the Home Secretary
hates being woken in the night.

33:23.480 --> 33:26.280
Be wise
if you didn't upset him again.

33:26.280 --> 33:28.360
Phone.

33:28.360 --> 33:30.920
Do you think
I'm entitled to compensation?

33:32.480 --> 33:34.680
If you go near that house again,

33:34.680 --> 33:37.040
none of your fancy phonecalls
will help you.

33:37.040 --> 33:39.120
Leave it to the professionals.

33:39.120 --> 33:43.200
It's now out of police jurisdiction.
It's government business.

33:43.200 --> 33:47.800
So if you or any of your people go
there again, you'll be trespassing.

33:47.800 --> 33:50.560
Leave it to the professionals.

33:50.560 --> 33:54.880
Abby? 'The creature
can camouflage itself.'

33:54.880 --> 33:59.200
That's why we didn't see it.
I'll call Becker for backup.

33:59.200 --> 34:01.160
'Don't go in there.'

34:06.440 --> 34:09.480
Hey!

34:09.480 --> 34:12.760
Don't go inside the house!

34:18.600 --> 34:21.600
Jenny, change of plan. I'm going in.

34:21.600 --> 34:23.560
Get here as soon as you can.

35:31.440 --> 35:33.520
Don't shoot!

35:33.520 --> 35:37.040
Who are you?
Ryan Mason.

35:38.640 --> 35:40.640
I had to come back,
to know the truth.

35:40.640 --> 35:43.320
Yeah? Well, your timing's lousy.

35:44.240 --> 35:46.280
Come on.

35:55.720 --> 35:58.280
Go, go!

36:44.600 --> 36:47.240
Abby!

36:47.240 --> 36:48.920
Wait.
OK.

36:51.120 --> 36:53.320
Is it upstairs?
Yeah.

36:58.760 --> 37:00.800
Are you OK?
Yeah.

37:00.800 --> 37:03.280
After you.
Thanks very much.

37:03.280 --> 37:05.240
You stay here.

37:43.600 --> 37:46.560
No! Help! Help! Help!

37:46.560 --> 37:49.840
Ssh. Trust me,
we can get you out of here.

37:49.840 --> 37:53.760
But you have to stay calm,
and don't make any noise.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.480
OK?

37:57.480 --> 37:59.440
I'm gonna take my hand away now.

38:03.680 --> 38:06.240
Help! Help!

38:06.240 --> 38:08.080
Ow!
Connor!

38:08.080 --> 38:10.200
Come on!

38:30.120 --> 38:33.560
What did you do
with the others, Ryan?

38:33.560 --> 38:35.640
It was the creature.

38:35.640 --> 38:38.680
What did you do with my brother?
You've got it wrong.

38:38.680 --> 38:41.720
Stay out of this.
This is out of your jurisdiction.

38:41.720 --> 38:45.720
You're dealing with things you don't
understand. He killed my brother.

38:45.720 --> 38:48.160
Just wait -
Shut up.

38:54.520 --> 38:57.640
No!

39:00.320 --> 39:02.880
He was my little brother.

39:06.560 --> 39:08.360
Look out!

39:16.800 --> 39:18.840
Stay still.

39:22.960 --> 39:25.000
He's camouflaging.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.880
An anomaly. Where's it gone?

40:01.280 --> 40:03.840
I've got a clear shot.

40:05.640 --> 40:07.800
Wait.
What?

40:07.800 --> 40:12.000
It was waiting for the anomaly
to reappear. It wants to go home.

40:21.840 --> 40:25.520
Cutter called it right.
The anomaly came back.

40:25.520 --> 40:28.240
Has it gone?

40:30.680 --> 40:32.120
Get down!

40:45.040 --> 40:47.880
Antistab vest.
Standard police issue.

40:47.880 --> 40:50.680
I am so gonna get one of them.

40:52.120 --> 40:55.160
I suppose an explanation's
out of the question.

40:55.160 --> 40:57.200
Totally.

40:57.200 --> 41:00.240
Yeah, I thought so.

41:22.360 --> 41:24.400
I thought it was you.

41:24.400 --> 41:26.440
Yeah, I got that.

41:26.440 --> 41:28.480
I'm sorry.

41:28.480 --> 41:30.520
You couldn't have known.

41:30.520 --> 41:33.360
Nobody could.

41:48.840 --> 41:50.800
Come on.

41:53.440 --> 41:56.200
Hi. Come on. Come on.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.360
They never found my brother's body.

42:14.360 --> 42:16.640
Maybe the creature didn't get him.

42:16.640 --> 42:19.200
Maybe he went through the...

42:20.320 --> 42:22.360
The anomaly.

42:22.360 --> 42:24.320
Yeah.

42:25.360 --> 42:27.800
That was a long time ago now, Danny.

42:27.800 --> 42:30.760
Maybe it's time just to let him go.

42:30.760 --> 42:32.720
You're right.

42:40.200 --> 42:42.280
I've just phoned Cutter.

42:42.280 --> 42:45.840
Told him he was right about
his prediction. What did he say?

42:45.840 --> 42:48.240
His words exactly? Mm.
Something like,

42:48.240 --> 42:50.200
"Of course I was right."

43:06.360 --> 43:08.400
What's going on, Quinn?

43:08.400 --> 43:10.480
I'm quitting, boss.

43:10.480 --> 43:13.160
We both know I wasn't right
for this job.

43:13.160 --> 43:17.160
Besides it gives you a chance
to be divisional champion.

43:20.120 --> 43:22.160
What are you gonna do?

43:22.160 --> 43:24.480
I'll think of something.

45:42.280 --> 45:44.600
I need something concrete
nobody could fake.

45:49.080 --> 45:53.200
Dinosaurs are different.
No-one believes they exist now.

45:55.160 --> 45:56.920
Where is everyone?

45:58.880 --> 46:01.080
I hear you've been looking for me.

46:05.240 --> 46:07.200
I wish there was another way.

46:13.960 --> 46:15.400
You are so fired.

46:15.960 --> 46:19.400
