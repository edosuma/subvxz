01:16.843 --> 01:18.977
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

01:18.979 --> 01:20.779
Hee, can I open this?

01:30.156 --> 01:31.056
Do you like it?

01:31.058 --> 01:32.858
- Yeah, do you like yours?
- Yeah.

01:34.727 --> 01:35.794
Do you like yours?

01:35.796 --> 01:37.863
Yeah. Are you sure?

01:38.098 --> 01:39.398
Mm-hmm.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.499
Okay, cool.

02:09.195 --> 02:10.329
Okay.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.667
Knock-knock, hey.

02:16.102 --> 02:18.137
You coming to the monthly
happy hour tonight?

02:18.139 --> 02:22.007
I invited everyone but Scott,
so... you don't have to worry.

02:23.309 --> 02:24.749
Why would you do
something like that?

02:25.278 --> 02:27.279
He's gonna think
I asked you to do that.

02:27.480 --> 02:30.115
Oh, because you still love him?

02:31.017 --> 02:34.153
Nope, I just don't want
to keep talking about him.

02:34.155 --> 02:35.521
Because you still love him.

02:35.722 --> 02:39.057
- Hmm, that's not it again.
- Oh, okay.

02:39.059 --> 02:42.060
But... anyway I can't go
tonight. Linda's having us over.

02:42.062 --> 02:44.396
Oh yeah, that's right,
your surprise party.

02:45.231 --> 02:48.467
Oh my god, I totally
just said that, didn't I?

02:48.469 --> 02:49.568
Yes, you did.

02:49.702 --> 02:50.969
Oopsie!

02:50.971 --> 02:52.404
Krystal: It's okay.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.605
I already knew.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.474
Well, don't tell Linda
that I told you, okay?

02:55.476 --> 02:57.876
- Oh yeah.
- Anyway, you look really good.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.578
Scott's gonna be jealous
like super soon.

02:59.580 --> 03:02.447
- Thank you.
- Okay, have fun tonight, bye!

03:02.449 --> 03:03.549
Okay.

03:09.255 --> 03:11.290
- Donny: Hey, Ted.
- Hey, Donny.

03:11.292 --> 03:12.324
I'm really sorry, man.

03:12.326 --> 03:14.326
I didn't really have time
to go home and get my checkbook.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.094
Hmm, again, huh?

03:16.096 --> 03:19.598
Yeah, anyway, is it okay
if I pay you next week?

03:20.600 --> 03:22.801
Totally,
don't even worry about it.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.469
- Thanks.
- Donny: It's totally awesome.

03:24.471 --> 03:25.737
- Right on.
- Thanks, Ted.

03:40.286 --> 03:42.187
Hey, happy birthday.

03:42.655 --> 03:43.922
Thanks, dad.

03:43.924 --> 03:46.225
Hey, mom and I
got you a couple things.

03:46.459 --> 03:48.260
Okay, talk about it later.

03:48.661 --> 03:49.861
Hey, guys.

03:49.863 --> 03:54.533
The thing that these...
Have in common here is that...

03:56.502 --> 03:58.637
Ah, we don't really know.

04:16.488 --> 04:18.656
If events worldwide
were an animal,

04:18.659 --> 04:20.392
what animal would we be?

04:20.394 --> 04:22.661
Black cat! I mean, Jaguar!

04:23.029 --> 04:24.296
I'll take Jaguar.

04:25.999 --> 04:27.132
Hey.

04:27.367 --> 04:28.567
Hi, Linda.

04:28.901 --> 04:30.602
You and Donny coming tonight?

04:31.004 --> 04:33.405
Yep, you told me a year ago.

04:33.840 --> 04:36.108
Yeah, don't come right at seven.

04:36.576 --> 04:39.411
Come at like... 7:05.

04:40.380 --> 04:42.748
Okay, 7:05.

04:43.016 --> 04:45.951
Just knock on the door
right at 7:05,

04:46.719 --> 04:48.086
because...

04:49.055 --> 04:50.922
I'm busy before that.

04:52.191 --> 04:54.693
Okay, sounds good.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.628
Dean: This is why
we're losing money.

04:58.465 --> 05:02.234
Happy birthdays-es you guys.

05:02.535 --> 05:04.169
Surprise!

05:04.304 --> 05:06.104
Wow, that's really weird.

05:06.639 --> 05:07.806
You put us in a heart?

05:08.641 --> 05:10.676
You're one person in my heart.

05:11.444 --> 05:13.612
It was cheaper for one graphic.

05:16.282 --> 05:17.349
Blow them out!

05:19.786 --> 05:23.221
Let's drink.

05:23.223 --> 05:25.324
I mean, eat the cake
and then let's drink.

05:29.762 --> 05:32.531
Linda: Oh, that's perfect.

05:33.066 --> 05:34.866
Taquito time!

05:37.203 --> 05:40.038
Whatever happened
with that piano competition

05:40.040 --> 05:42.908
you were doing? You were gonna
go on tour... or something?

05:42.910 --> 05:44.343
Ivy, I told you.

05:44.345 --> 05:45.744
- He didn't win.
- Oh.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.245
Wrenn: Don't make him
feel bad about not winning.

05:47.247 --> 05:47.245
It's okay.

05:47.247 --> 05:50.115
- Ivy: I hit a nerve.
- Yes, you did, jeez.

05:50.117 --> 05:52.584
Rubbing it in his face
that he lost, sorry.

05:52.586 --> 05:55.620
Actually, I found
a manager, anyway.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.155
- Ivy: Oh!
- That's great!

05:57.157 --> 05:59.624
So, sorry,
but how long do you try?

05:59.626 --> 06:01.693
Do you keep trying, right?

06:01.695 --> 06:03.428
Cause you could
be doing that forever

06:03.430 --> 06:05.397
and never reap the fruits.

06:05.698 --> 06:07.666
I have to talk to you
about something.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.334
Absolutely not. If you talk
about work right now,

06:09.336 --> 06:10.769
I'm gonna put a bullet
in my brain.

06:10.771 --> 06:12.237
I don't want to talk about work.

06:12.772 --> 06:14.172
I want you to meet someone.

06:14.174 --> 06:16.641
No, just 'cause of the way
you said that I can't.

06:16.643 --> 06:18.977
Trust me.
I know what I'm talking about.

06:18.979 --> 06:21.146
- No.
- I've been divorced twice.

06:21.647 --> 06:23.782
Antioxidants, anyway...

06:23.784 --> 06:24.983
Who is that?

06:26.619 --> 06:29.221
Linda: Oh my god,
he's right here, Craig!

06:30.323 --> 06:31.823
- Oh, god.
- What?

06:31.825 --> 06:34.092
I know Craig.
Hi, Craig. How are you?

06:34.560 --> 06:36.795
I started that new diet
like you said

06:36.929 --> 06:39.331
and went to subway
and got one sandwich.

06:39.333 --> 06:41.099
Yep, subway diet.

06:41.567 --> 06:44.002
But then I went home
and ordered a pizza.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.370
Eh, it happens.

06:45.372 --> 06:47.038
Then I had
a tub of Ben and Jerry's.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.273
Sounds like you're doing good.

06:48.275 --> 06:49.374
With chocolate sauce.

06:49.509 --> 06:51.710
All right,
maybe you should just give up

06:51.712 --> 06:54.212
and kind of enjoy
you're at your best now.

06:54.680 --> 06:55.947
What do you say?

06:56.549 --> 06:57.616
She's right.

07:00.052 --> 07:02.120
And I think, by the way,
beautiful,

07:02.122 --> 07:05.490
that you're following
your passion, but at what cost?

07:05.492 --> 07:06.825
Until you quit, right?

07:06.827 --> 07:10.562
Or not quit, but find other
avenues for... um, success?

07:10.963 --> 07:13.665
- Well, I think that's...
- Yeah, we don't know, right?

07:13.667 --> 07:15.000
That's why
I got a business degree.

07:15.002 --> 07:15.834
She did.

07:15.836 --> 07:15.834
- And I'm so thankful for it.
- Ugh, me too.

07:15.836 --> 07:20.405
Because, see, whereas you
are so specialized you only,

07:20.407 --> 07:22.240
got a degree in music,
if that makes any sense,

07:22.242 --> 07:25.177
whereas I kind of have mobility.

07:25.179 --> 07:27.212
But it's good about the manager,
anyways.

07:27.214 --> 07:29.381
That's a light
at the end of the tunnel.

07:29.383 --> 07:30.582
It really is, yeah.

07:30.584 --> 07:31.850
I guess, for you at this point.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.885
I'm just thinking, thinking,
got it.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.420
I just remembered
I have a friend

07:35.422 --> 07:39.024
who studied tuba
in school and now he's making

07:39.026 --> 07:40.759
all the music
for iPhone commercials.

07:40.761 --> 07:43.562
We could slip his number to you

07:43.564 --> 07:45.997
if and when the manager
doesn't really pan out.

07:46.365 --> 07:47.866
He's always looking for interns

07:47.868 --> 07:50.602
and he is, of course...
Much younger than you are.

07:50.604 --> 07:51.870
Would that be weird, no?

07:52.004 --> 07:53.572
Wrenn: You could work
for a 16-year-old, right?

07:53.574 --> 07:55.173
- He's gorgeous.
- Oh...

07:55.775 --> 07:57.976
- I agree.
- And very strict.

08:08.955 --> 08:10.288
Do you mind if I cut your face?

08:10.290 --> 08:12.557
Oh my god, oh.

08:12.925 --> 08:15.060
- Ah, that's funny.
- Oh, I'm gonna do it.

08:15.062 --> 08:17.629
I'm gonna do it, oop, oop, oop.
Oh, I did it.

08:18.264 --> 08:19.331
Sorry, face.

08:20.132 --> 08:21.366
That's funny.

08:21.368 --> 08:23.301
Uh, you come here a lot?

08:24.070 --> 08:25.604
- What do you mean, the house?
- Mm-hmm.

08:25.606 --> 08:27.439
No, Marina invited me.

08:27.740 --> 08:30.475
- Did you meet online?
- No, I don't do online dating.

08:30.477 --> 08:32.210
Oh yeah, no, me neither.
I've never even heard of that.

08:32.212 --> 08:33.678
I, uh, just made it up.

08:33.679 --> 08:34.813
Oh.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.616
You look just like my
grandpa's old neighbor, Gus.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.384
Uh, okay.

08:39.952 --> 08:41.219
Yeah, it's uncanny.

08:41.221 --> 08:43.421
Is Gus, like, 70?

08:43.423 --> 08:45.991
- Nope, he's dead.
- Oh, wow, perfect, thank you.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.826
Yeah, he was the best though.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.127
He made his own
salt water Taffy.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.629
- Oh, Taffy, nice.
- Yeah.

08:50.631 --> 08:53.265
- Yeah, good old, old Taffy Gus.
- Krystal: Yeah.

08:53.267 --> 08:54.633
That is, uh,
sounds a lot creepier

08:54.635 --> 08:55.867
than I thought
it was gonna sound. Yeah.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.102
Yeah.

08:57.104 --> 08:59.504
- Oh, uh-oh.
- Uh-oh, what?

08:59.506 --> 09:02.307
Oh, I think I have to save
my brother from like a...

09:02.309 --> 09:04.209
Probably
a terrible conversation.

09:04.844 --> 09:06.945
- What do you mean?
- Uh, well, it's kind of weird.

09:07.079 --> 09:09.147
We have a codeword for,
like, party emergencies.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.149
- You have a codeword?
- Krystal: Mm-hmm.

09:11.151 --> 09:14.786
Oh, cool, so you guys are,
like, in third grade?

09:14.954 --> 09:17.188
Ah, well, twins don't age so...

09:17.423 --> 09:18.623
Who are you?

09:18.958 --> 09:20.625
Oh, hey, I'm Andy.

09:20.627 --> 09:21.993
- Krystal.
- It's, uh, nice to meet you.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.328
Sorry about the frosting.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.030
Oh, yeah,
you have really dry hands.

09:25.032 --> 09:26.032
Andy: Thanks.

09:26.098 --> 09:27.132
Ivy: Can I give you some advice?

09:27.134 --> 09:28.266
Wrenn: You're gonna love it.

09:28.268 --> 09:29.568
Go home, right now.

09:29.802 --> 09:31.303
Dispose of half of what you own.

09:31.305 --> 09:32.337
Do it.

09:32.339 --> 09:33.805
Is that your brother?

09:33.807 --> 09:36.274
Mm-hmm, he looks sad.

09:36.542 --> 09:38.577
That's the first thing
I noticed about him,

09:38.878 --> 09:41.179
this deep, unfathomable sadness.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.847
Holding back,
you are holding back.

09:42.849 --> 09:44.015
Mm-hmm.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.517
He's a good-looking dude.

09:46.352 --> 09:47.419
Hmm.

09:53.993 --> 09:55.226
Thanks for saving me.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.629
I think that was gonna go on
another two hours.

09:58.130 --> 09:59.931
No problem, that's the worst.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.467
Andy's an art teacher and he's
reading <i> the hobbit</i> in German.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.836
- Yeah.
- What's it called in German?

10:05.071 --> 10:06.237
It's just called <i> the hobbit.</i>

10:06.239 --> 10:07.939
There's no German word
for hobbit.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.207
Donny: Makes sense.

10:09.508 --> 10:10.909
Um, how do you like teaching?

10:10.911 --> 10:13.011
'Cause I teach piano
and I hate it.

10:13.179 --> 10:14.412
Oh, I love it.

10:14.414 --> 10:17.415
I teach elementary now,
but I used to teach high school,

10:17.417 --> 10:20.485
but, uh, there was
this one like 6'5" kid,

10:20.487 --> 10:23.488
and, uh, I told him to go
to detention and he was like,

10:23.490 --> 10:27.626
"fuck detention," and then
he stabbed me with a protractor.

10:27.927 --> 10:29.027
Yikes.

10:29.261 --> 10:30.962
No, no, no,
it was cool though I just...

10:30.964 --> 10:33.064
I just went back
and beat the shit out of him.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.132
Hmm.

10:34.400 --> 10:35.600
I'm kidding.

10:35.602 --> 10:39.004
I haven't actually,
uh, attacked a child.

10:40.606 --> 10:43.508
He was really big,
but, yeah, I was fine.

10:43.709 --> 10:45.810
And now I teach
elementary school,

10:45.945 --> 10:48.079
which is the little kids.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.581
They're still stronger than me,

10:49.749 --> 10:53.051
but I'm taller so...
That gives me the advantage.

10:53.053 --> 10:54.252
Donny: Nice.

10:54.587 --> 10:57.722
Yeah, uh,
so your sister was telling me

10:57.724 --> 10:59.658
that you guys
are designing a website?

11:01.127 --> 11:02.961
Yeah,
it's a website where you post

11:02.963 --> 11:04.663
fat pictures
of your ex-boyfriends.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.665
Yeah, it's a green initiative.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.600
Krystal: We wanted to do
something paperless.

11:08.602 --> 11:11.302
Oh, okay,
so what you're telling me

11:11.304 --> 11:13.872
is that I should never date
either of you, ever.

11:14.206 --> 11:16.374
Well, I don't think
we're gonna use it.

11:16.376 --> 11:17.676
We're just making it.

11:17.977 --> 11:19.210
Just designing it.

11:19.945 --> 11:22.814
Actually, my friend Glenn
builds websites for a living.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.783
Yeah, he just sold
his digital agency.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.818
He's doing this
mobile photo booth thing now,

11:26.820 --> 11:28.653
but he's throwing a party.

11:28.655 --> 11:31.389
You guys should, uh...
You guys should come.

11:32.224 --> 11:33.491
Yeah, that sounds awesome,
thanks.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.026
That sounds awesome, mm-hmm.

11:35.028 --> 11:38.296
Andy: I know it's like really
hard building a business.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.165
Furby's are selling
for a hundred bucks a pop

11:40.167 --> 11:41.499
in Thailand right now.

11:42.134 --> 11:43.468
They're status symbols.

11:43.470 --> 11:44.703
That's depressing.

11:44.705 --> 11:47.505
Mint condition or
can it be gently loved?

11:47.507 --> 11:50.842
Ah, shit... I got to go.

11:51.110 --> 11:53.878
I'm, uh, looking after
some chickens down the road.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.081
I gotta go turn the lamps on.

11:57.183 --> 11:59.350
- Wow, all right.
- Okay.

11:59.352 --> 12:02.320
But we will call you
about your website friend.

12:02.621 --> 12:05.623
Yeah, we'll do
a group text thing.

12:05.625 --> 12:07.325
- All of us.
- Donny: Yeah.

12:07.327 --> 12:10.695
Okay, cool, uh, it was great
meeting you guys.

12:10.697 --> 12:11.930
Group text me.

12:16.669 --> 12:17.802
Bye, Andy!

12:23.609 --> 12:26.511
It almost makes me nervous,
like, how relaxed Andy is.

12:26.513 --> 12:27.812
Like, what aren't
you telling us?

12:27.814 --> 12:28.913
Oh, I know.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.615
- He's like a yes person.
- Mm-hmm.

12:30.617 --> 12:32.150
- Scott was a no person.
- Mm-hmm.

12:32.152 --> 12:33.818
Remember when he was like,
"I'll come to your birthday,

12:33.820 --> 12:35.520
but I tend to have more fun
with my friends."

12:35.522 --> 12:36.755
- God, fuck.
- Yuck.

12:36.757 --> 12:37.757
The worst.

12:37.990 --> 12:40.391
Do you think Andy spends
a lot of time on his hair?

12:40.393 --> 12:43.528
No, I think he just wakes up
looking good, every time.

12:43.662 --> 12:47.999
But... I think he drinks a lot
of water, like, just, a lot.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.567
- Just really hydrated.
- Really well hydrated.

12:49.569 --> 12:51.169
Really, like I think
he just, like,

12:51.171 --> 12:53.004
a backpack of coconut waters
all the time.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.105
Mm-hmm.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.074
- Like, the face. You can tell.
- No, I can tell.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.575
The face
is filled with hydration.

12:57.577 --> 12:58.777
I can tell by looking at him.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.612
Mm-hmm, but I don't know.

13:00.846 --> 13:03.181
Oh, I wanted to show you
this thing.

13:03.183 --> 13:05.683
I was thinking
after we finish recip-easy,

13:05.685 --> 13:07.852
we should go
to that motel we saw that time,

13:07.854 --> 13:09.354
the one
with all the themed rooms.

13:09.356 --> 13:10.922
You know what I'm talking about?

13:11.590 --> 13:13.091
And like we can just
like go for a week,

13:13.093 --> 13:15.093
and like stay in a different
room like every night.

13:15.095 --> 13:16.427
Whimsical lodging.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.062
Yeah, it won't be that whimsical

13:18.064 --> 13:20.431
- 'cause we're gonna plan it...
- Oh, the forest room.

13:20.433 --> 13:21.733
Yeah, no,
they're all ugly on purpose.

13:21.735 --> 13:22.901
Like, that's the whole thing.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.202
- Yeah, I remember, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

13:24.204 --> 13:25.703
I kind of want
to like do the Titanic

13:25.705 --> 13:27.739
or like the...
You know, any of these.

13:27.741 --> 13:28.840
Mm-hmm.

13:30.142 --> 13:31.342
Yeah, we should totally do it.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.915
I got to go to bed.
You got to take that away.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.116
Okay.

13:38.118 --> 13:39.551
- Take it away.
- Me too.

13:39.553 --> 13:40.718
I can't eat any more of this.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.053
- I got to go.
- All right.

13:42.521 --> 13:43.621
Goodnight.

13:44.790 --> 13:46.457
I'm just gonna have
one more bite actually,

13:46.459 --> 13:47.826
but then I'll go.

13:48.460 --> 13:49.527
Good night!

14:51.023 --> 14:52.290
Krystal: What are you
doing here?

14:52.292 --> 14:53.925
Char: Brought your b-day gifts!

14:54.293 --> 14:57.896
So I got this idea I want you
to roll around in your noodle.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.998
My friend, Kelly,
my nurse friend, Kelly,

15:00.000 --> 15:02.767
on our days off, we go junkin'.

15:02.769 --> 15:04.669
You would not believe

15:04.671 --> 15:08.206
what people
donate to the goodwill.

15:08.340 --> 15:09.674
What is all that?

15:09.676 --> 15:12.410
So now, I got a basement
full of antiques.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.512
So I'm downstairs, thinking,

15:14.813 --> 15:17.448
"how can I
turn this into a cash cow?"

15:17.816 --> 15:21.819
You know, buy low,
sell high kind of thing?

15:21.821 --> 15:24.622
Now I'm driving down the street
and I notice at the gym...

15:24.624 --> 15:26.791
- You know, the gym by my house?
- Mm-hmm.

15:26.793 --> 15:29.560
Right next to it is,
"space for rent."

15:29.562 --> 15:32.096
So I just whip in there,
and I'm sitting there

15:32.098 --> 15:35.700
in the car contemplating
the potential,

15:35.702 --> 15:37.735
when, boom,
I have this epiphany.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.071
I'm gonna open a Juicery.

15:41.273 --> 15:43.107
'Cause how hard can it be?

15:43.575 --> 15:45.710
So then I'm envisioning
these sweaty people

15:45.712 --> 15:48.546
coming out of the gym,
so they come in

15:48.548 --> 15:52.050
and that's the hook,
'cause when they come in,

15:52.052 --> 15:54.185
I'm gonna have
all my antiques there.

15:55.387 --> 15:57.221
But I got a name for it.

15:57.223 --> 15:59.958
It's gonna be called
first fruits.

16:00.759 --> 16:02.727
It's biblical, you know.

16:02.729 --> 16:05.363
It's six A.M.,
six in the morning.

16:05.365 --> 16:08.099
I haven't told your dad yet.
He's just gonna shit.

16:12.271 --> 16:13.338
Oh, boy.

16:14.406 --> 16:15.907
Char: They're feminine.

16:16.375 --> 16:17.575
That's what men like.

16:17.577 --> 16:20.311
They like feminine and pretty.

16:20.546 --> 16:23.047
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Donny?

16:25.851 --> 16:27.051
Oh, wow.

16:27.319 --> 16:28.886
It's a bow tie.

16:28.888 --> 16:30.955
It's not one of those Clippies.
It's a real bow tie.

16:30.957 --> 16:33.157
You're gonna have
to learn how to tie it.

16:33.159 --> 16:36.127
It's for when Saul gets you
your first gig.

16:36.695 --> 16:39.063
- Thanks, mom.
- So what you need to do Donny,

16:39.065 --> 16:41.065
every day, you need to get up,

16:41.067 --> 16:43.401
you need to put that bow-tie on,

16:43.403 --> 16:45.303
and that sends the universe
a message

16:45.305 --> 16:47.805
that you are ready
for prosperity.

16:48.807 --> 16:50.074
Okay.

16:50.476 --> 16:52.710
Did I tell you guys
about that special

16:52.712 --> 16:55.413
I watched on national geographic
the other day on pythons?

16:55.547 --> 16:56.881
What?

16:56.883 --> 17:01.753
This python grabbed this
monkey, and I swear to god,

17:01.755 --> 17:05.390
the monkey's eyeballs
were about to pop out.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.425
That sounds terrible.

17:07.426 --> 17:08.726
Well, Krystal...

17:09.994 --> 17:11.596
It's the circle of life.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.498
It's all about perspective.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.433
So anyway, I gotta bounce,

17:16.001 --> 17:17.835
but I think
I'm really on to something

17:17.837 --> 17:19.737
with this first fruits.

17:19.739 --> 17:22.573
And I'm coming into
the next chapter of my life.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.209
So, give me a kiss goodbye.

17:25.577 --> 17:27.244
- Bye.
- Char: Bye.

17:28.747 --> 17:29.881
Bye, Donny.

17:31.817 --> 17:33.618
I'm a little worried
Andy's inviting us

17:33.620 --> 17:35.953
so his website friend
can steal our ideas.

17:35.955 --> 17:37.321
What do you think?

17:37.323 --> 17:38.389
What?

17:38.757 --> 17:40.158
That's crazy.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.593
Maybe he can help us
build them finally.

17:42.861 --> 17:44.562
Yeah, that is crazy.

17:44.930 --> 17:46.831
I guess I'm not as trusting.

17:47.966 --> 17:49.400
Andy doesn't seem like the kind

17:49.402 --> 17:51.202
of person that would
do that anyway.

17:51.204 --> 17:52.904
No, definitely not.

17:53.238 --> 17:54.539
Krystal: All right,
but just in case,

17:54.541 --> 17:56.941
let's only tell him
about recip-easy.

17:57.643 --> 17:58.843
Okay.

18:06.485 --> 18:08.252
Hello, hi, I have
that shirt in plum.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.487
Andy: Hey, buddy.

18:09.489 --> 18:11.155
You brought two people.
That's fun.

18:11.557 --> 18:13.424
Come on in.
Here's your money.

18:13.659 --> 18:14.826
I'll see if there's enough.

18:14.828 --> 18:16.160
Hey, is that shirt new?

18:16.162 --> 18:17.728
- Uh-huh.
- I like it.

18:18.063 --> 18:19.997
Now, is there a limit
to the items we can buy

18:19.999 --> 18:21.799
and can we see the items first?

18:21.801 --> 18:23.201
No, that's not how it works.

18:23.203 --> 18:26.671
Bart married Glenn and Susan
and he also does auctions.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.539
Yeah, and pet parties.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.441
Yeah, is that
like a package deal?

18:30.443 --> 18:33.511
No, but it does bring in
repeat business. Just kidding.

18:33.879 --> 18:35.246
What's happening here?

18:35.248 --> 18:37.748
We're clearing the toxic
items from Glenn's home.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.817
Susan decamped
for India last year.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.519
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.488
She just left all her stuff?

18:44.223 --> 18:46.057
As far as I can tell,
she took her paintbrushes

18:46.059 --> 18:48.359
and a Microdermabrasion kit,
so...

18:48.894 --> 18:51.929
Everything else is...
Pretty much up for grabs.

18:51.931 --> 18:53.097
Jeez.

18:53.099 --> 18:54.532
Oh, he doesn't need it.
He's rich.

18:54.666 --> 18:56.300
I don't need it.
I don't care.

18:56.302 --> 18:59.637
I'll just redo the whole thing.
I'll just... redo it.

19:00.072 --> 19:02.540
Yeah, you need to get
a fresh start, Glenn.

19:02.674 --> 19:04.942
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but
okay, where is that sweater

19:04.944 --> 19:06.544
that Susan got
from Fran Drescher

19:06.546 --> 19:08.946
after the <i> nanny</i> premiere?

19:08.948 --> 19:10.114
Ooh.

19:10.116 --> 19:12.617
I don't think we have that.
Okay, you guys ready?

19:12.619 --> 19:13.918
Spend your money wisely because

19:13.920 --> 19:16.087
we got a lot of treasures here,
okay?

19:16.089 --> 19:20.758
First item up is, oh,
it's an expensive one.

19:21.026 --> 19:23.394
We have, uh, the earrings

19:23.562 --> 19:26.030
Glenn's wife wore
while cheating on Glenn.

19:26.032 --> 19:28.166
Wow, off to a blazing start.

19:28.168 --> 19:29.300
Five dollars.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.636
25, I'll let you borrow them.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.337
Why are you bidding on earrings?

19:33.339 --> 19:35.506
I'm making a tie-tack.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.607
Oh!

19:36.609 --> 19:38.176
- 25.
- Sold.

19:38.343 --> 19:42.046
Next item up
is this nice peach blazer.

19:42.814 --> 19:43.981
Size medium.

19:44.116 --> 19:45.216
Lovely.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.821
Hey, can I ask you
a weird question?

19:51.924 --> 19:55.126
Is Andy dating anyone,
like a girlfriend?

19:55.527 --> 19:57.595
Even like a boyfriend, maybe?

19:58.463 --> 20:00.898
Actually, I think he's dated
both, but no one right now.

20:00.900 --> 20:04.101
Okay, sorry about
your wife by the way.

20:04.103 --> 20:05.803
Man, that's bad news.

20:06.438 --> 20:07.572
Thanks.

20:09.508 --> 20:12.510
Oh, uh, also, we
have a business idea

20:12.512 --> 20:15.046
to talk to you about, um, later.

20:15.314 --> 20:17.748
I know now's not good,
but another time.

20:18.617 --> 20:20.351
- Okay.
- Cool.

20:24.456 --> 20:29.093
Okay, last item,
this Espresso maker.

20:29.095 --> 20:32.496
It's got...
It's an Espresso maker.

20:32.498 --> 20:33.864
I am so tired of this game.

20:33.866 --> 20:35.032
I'll put in a five.

20:35.034 --> 20:36.234
Okay, fine, sold.

20:36.236 --> 20:37.935
Krystal: We need
an Espresso maker.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.103
Donny: That's true, we do.

20:39.105 --> 20:40.771
Bart: One last thing.

20:41.473 --> 20:43.708
Finally... this.

20:44.109 --> 20:46.110
Ugh, where'd you
get that awful thing?

20:46.112 --> 20:47.578
How can you give that away?

20:47.779 --> 20:52.450
I'm gonna paint him something
else, like a hawk or a wolf.

20:53.051 --> 20:55.219
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
that was your wedding present.

20:55.221 --> 20:56.988
It's fine, he doesn't
want the painting.

20:56.990 --> 20:58.656
It's a constant reminder
of failure and heartbreak.

20:58.658 --> 20:59.824
Why would he want it?

20:59.826 --> 21:02.560
Wow, thanks, Bart.

21:02.562 --> 21:05.663
Sorry, well, obviously
everybody wants this,

21:05.665 --> 21:07.632
so who's got the
most money left?

21:07.966 --> 21:10.401
Donny hasn't spent
any of his cash.

21:10.403 --> 21:12.036
I'd like to return
the Espresso maker.

21:12.038 --> 21:13.204
Can I get that money back?

21:13.206 --> 21:14.572
Mm-mm, no refunds.

21:14.574 --> 21:16.040
You should take it.

21:16.908 --> 21:18.776
Are you sure?
I feel kind of bad.

21:19.411 --> 21:21.679
- Andy: Yeah.
- Not really my taste.

21:22.080 --> 21:25.082
Okay, I'd love to have it.
Amazing.

21:27.853 --> 21:29.620
Donny:
I have an Andy painting now.

21:29.622 --> 21:30.888
Laser: Yay!

21:30.890 --> 21:32.456
Wait, your last name's
not Warhol, is it?

21:32.458 --> 21:34.892
Bart: Stupid.

21:35.260 --> 21:37.028
Andy: Uh, I like to
put it on everything.

21:37.030 --> 21:38.362
- Ketchup.
- Yes!

21:38.364 --> 21:42.466
Uh, okay, okay, ooh, this is
my least favorite thing ever.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.201
People that wear
sandals with dirty feet?

21:44.203 --> 21:45.603
Uh, yes, but no.

21:45.605 --> 21:47.171
- Sports.
- Yes!

21:47.572 --> 21:50.441
Um, um, um, I really, I
want to, I want to eat a...

21:50.443 --> 21:52.476
- Taco!
- Yes, yeah!

21:55.380 --> 21:56.647
How'd you know that?

21:56.649 --> 21:58.082
I just said want
I wanted to eat.

21:58.084 --> 22:00.284
Taco, we won.

22:03.055 --> 22:04.789
Glenn: Uh, it's better
if you close the curtain.

22:04.791 --> 22:06.457
Yeah, sorry, it's hard to fit.

22:06.459 --> 22:07.591
We can fit.

22:07.593 --> 22:08.759
- I think this is a...
- We can fit.

22:08.761 --> 22:10.061
I'm pretty sure
this is a two-person.

22:10.063 --> 22:11.796
- No, we can fit.
- Yeah, okay.

22:11.798 --> 22:12.930
We can fit.

22:18.236 --> 22:20.805
Andy: Oh yeah, it sends
them to your phone, too.

22:20.807 --> 22:22.673
See?

22:24.476 --> 22:26.243
Why didn't we think of this?

22:26.245 --> 22:27.345
I don't know.

22:32.117 --> 22:33.617
You carry your own pen?

22:33.619 --> 22:34.819
Andy: Oh, yeah.

22:35.253 --> 22:37.054
I don't like ballpoints.

22:37.056 --> 22:38.489
I only use felt tips.

22:41.093 --> 22:43.294
It's better
for keeping the photo okay.

22:55.607 --> 22:57.375
Donny: All right, oh, boy.

22:57.377 --> 22:59.343
Andy: A little
lower, lower, okay.

22:59.345 --> 23:01.579
- Donny: Can you get it?
- Andy: There you go.

23:01.980 --> 23:03.147
Andy: All right.

23:03.149 --> 23:05.316
- Nope, it's not.
- Shit, okay.

23:05.318 --> 23:09.754
Okay, let's move a little
bit, so you can get in.

23:10.822 --> 23:12.156
Donny: Okay.

23:13.492 --> 23:14.558
Thanks.

23:16.728 --> 23:19.296
Maybe you ought to reconsider
the painting purchase.

23:19.298 --> 23:21.399
I mean, it's kind of big.

23:21.401 --> 23:22.800
Oh, no I never leave a party

23:22.934 --> 23:25.102
without taking
at least one painting, so...

23:26.705 --> 23:28.639
Are you sure
that I can have this?

23:28.641 --> 23:30.641
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you bought it.

23:30.643 --> 23:31.809
Have it.

23:31.811 --> 23:34.011
Okay, thank you.

23:34.212 --> 23:35.379
Yeah.

23:37.315 --> 23:39.083
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.

23:43.955 --> 23:45.222
- Come here.
- Oh.

23:46.825 --> 23:48.359
Good to see ya.

23:48.693 --> 23:50.494
Krystal: Bye.

23:51.963 --> 23:53.664
- See ya.
- Bye, okay.

24:06.545 --> 24:08.813
- Thanks again!
- Bye, thanks again!

25:27.692 --> 25:29.260
You got to organize
some of this.

25:29.262 --> 25:31.228
You just start putting up...

25:31.530 --> 25:32.963
I don't even know
where it is anymore.

25:32.965 --> 25:35.232
- Donny: It's a vision board.
- This is a vision board...

25:35.234 --> 25:37.268
Donny: It doesn't
have to be organized.

25:37.270 --> 25:39.470
- Some of them are tasks.
- It doesn't have to be.

25:39.472 --> 25:40.538
The whole time
I thought it was tasks.

25:40.540 --> 25:42.806
I didn't know it was visions.
That's why I'm pinning up tasks.

25:42.808 --> 25:44.141
Some, like,
most of the things...

25:44.143 --> 25:45.576
What the hell is this?

25:46.011 --> 25:47.411
So what happened
the other night?

25:47.413 --> 25:48.846
You didn't call me.

25:48.848 --> 25:49.947
I did call you.

25:50.081 --> 25:51.649
You should think about
getting voicemail.

25:51.651 --> 25:53.317
Nope, I haven't
turned it back on

25:53.319 --> 25:55.452
since Steve left me
that ugly message.

25:55.454 --> 25:56.854
"Hi, Linda, you
ruined Christmas.

25:56.856 --> 25:58.022
This is Steve."

25:58.156 --> 26:00.524
Did I tell you what he
said to me yesterday?

26:00.526 --> 26:02.026
Yikes, no what?

26:02.994 --> 26:04.295
I went to pick
up Frankie 'cause,

26:04.297 --> 26:05.896
you know, he has
to be on lockdown,

26:05.898 --> 26:06.964
and Steve looked at me and said,

26:06.966 --> 26:09.533
"Linda, you look like
absolute fucking shit.

26:09.535 --> 26:11.535
Please go to the bathroom
and do your hair."

26:11.537 --> 26:13.003
Wow, that's really mean.

26:13.005 --> 26:14.738
Linda: Yeah, can
you believe that?

26:14.740 --> 26:15.906
What'd ya say?

26:15.908 --> 26:17.341
I roundhouse kicked him.

26:17.343 --> 26:18.442
You what?

26:18.444 --> 26:20.344
I roundhouse kicked him,
with my Tori Burch's

26:20.346 --> 26:23.847
right in his balls and I
said, "fuck you, Steve!"

26:23.849 --> 26:25.950
- Wow.
- Yeah.

26:27.352 --> 26:29.186
So where'd you go?
Did you go out?

26:29.988 --> 26:31.388
We went to his friend's house.

26:31.390 --> 26:32.823
Shut up.

26:32.825 --> 26:34.191
That's where we went.

26:34.193 --> 26:37.261
Well just remember,
if not you then who?

26:37.462 --> 26:39.063
Okay, we'll see.

26:39.331 --> 26:40.764
Linda: I don't know.

26:41.132 --> 26:43.233
He looks like he knows
he's good-looking.

26:43.902 --> 26:45.669
I think he's using you.

26:45.671 --> 26:47.938
I don't really know
what he'd be using me for.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.707
I don't really have
a lot going on right now.

26:49.709 --> 26:51.575
Just wait.
"I work a lot.

26:51.577 --> 26:53.310
I have to go to my
uncle's to cook fish.

26:53.312 --> 26:54.878
Did you feed my dog
a bunch of fudge?

26:54.880 --> 26:56.080
He's dead."

26:56.082 --> 26:58.048
Next thing you know,
he's slashing your tires

26:58.050 --> 26:59.717
if he's anything like Steve.

26:59.719 --> 27:01.852
Why would this person
be anything like Steve?

27:01.854 --> 27:03.120
I don't know.

27:03.722 --> 27:05.422
I have to go sit with Dale.

27:05.424 --> 27:08.359
His wife left him and I
think he might have melanoma.

27:08.361 --> 27:09.593
Jesus, really?

27:09.595 --> 27:11.795
Yep, big mole on his neck.

27:12.764 --> 27:13.864
See ya later.

27:14.966 --> 27:16.567
Dale!

27:30.382 --> 27:32.583
Randi: Cheese, bitch.

27:32.585 --> 27:33.851
Oh my god.

27:34.386 --> 27:35.819
What are you doing?

27:35.821 --> 27:37.921
That's gonna be
such a great pic.

27:37.923 --> 27:39.623
Don't you love Polaroids?

27:40.091 --> 27:41.759
Oh.

27:41.761 --> 27:43.260
Why would you do that?

27:43.262 --> 27:44.995
Well, you're the only one
eating the cheeseburgers,

27:44.997 --> 27:46.430
and I don't want
Dale to feel bad

27:46.432 --> 27:48.065
'cause he's the one that
brought the cheeseburgers,

27:48.067 --> 27:50.601
and there are no pictures
of anyone eating them, so...

27:51.136 --> 27:52.536
His wife is leaving him

27:52.538 --> 27:54.805
and I think
he's getting fired tomorrow.

27:54.807 --> 27:56.140
Please don't put that up.

27:56.142 --> 27:59.076
Oh, quit being such a whore.
It's gonna be such a cute pic.

27:59.078 --> 28:01.211
I think it'll make Scott
really jealous.

28:01.780 --> 28:05.382
Oh, b-t-dubs, he's been
checking you out during lunch.

28:05.384 --> 28:07.751
I think you guys are
gonna get back together.

28:07.753 --> 28:09.586
Why, did he say something?

28:09.588 --> 28:11.021
Randi: I don't know.

28:11.023 --> 28:13.023
We were decorating
for the holiday of hearts

28:13.025 --> 28:15.693
and he said that you guys
didn't have anything in common,

28:15.695 --> 28:17.161
like when you guys
were together,

28:17.163 --> 28:19.329
like for the whole entire
time and that it was

28:19.331 --> 28:22.566
definitely for the best,
like 100% no looking back,

28:22.568 --> 28:26.003
but I think he might be
pushing down his feelings.

28:26.005 --> 28:27.671
People change, you know?

28:27.939 --> 28:29.840
Anyway, I told him that
you miss him so much

28:29.842 --> 28:32.643
that it's like insane
and that you guys are soul-mates.

28:32.645 --> 28:33.911
I think he bought it.

28:38.517 --> 28:42.686
M'Kay, that's my day.

28:49.894 --> 28:52.129
Randi:
Like, her mouth is so big,

28:53.331 --> 28:55.899
the largest a mouth
could be open.

28:57.035 --> 28:59.570
It's like taking up the whole
entire Polaroid.

29:00.305 --> 29:02.106
Scott: The burger?

29:31.836 --> 29:33.003
Not bad.

29:34.005 --> 29:36.640
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

29:37.175 --> 29:40.177
So, uh... what's the next step?

29:44.048 --> 29:45.816
Uh, we send it to ray.

29:46.317 --> 29:49.987
And ray is your friend
at the record label, right?

29:50.255 --> 29:52.256
Yeah, I told you about ray?

29:53.424 --> 29:54.758
Yeah, of course.

29:54.760 --> 29:57.561
Yeah, you said that he's, well,

29:57.563 --> 30:00.430
signed basically everyone
I've ever listened to, so...

30:00.965 --> 30:04.201
Yeah, yeah,
you're gonna be great.

30:06.271 --> 30:10.507
Would you mind if I hang on
to your car another few days?

30:11.142 --> 30:13.277
I still got some errands to run.

30:14.679 --> 30:16.180
Yeah, no, I don't mind.

30:16.447 --> 30:18.215
You're sending my tape
to a record label.

30:18.217 --> 30:21.051
The least I could do is let you
borrow my car for another day.

30:21.053 --> 30:23.420
You're right.

30:30.628 --> 30:32.462
Sorry, so when do we send it?

30:33.765 --> 30:35.532
I'm thinking about that.

30:36.134 --> 30:39.803
I think that your...
Uh, runs on that

30:39.805 --> 30:43.707
third movement could
be, uh... crisper.

30:45.977 --> 30:46.977
Crisper.

30:50.181 --> 30:51.348
Even crisper.

30:52.717 --> 30:56.186
Maybe give that another try
and then we'll send it.

31:04.128 --> 31:07.531
You know what? Actually,
I just remembered, um...

31:07.999 --> 31:12.703
I have to do something today
and I need my car back today.

31:13.438 --> 31:15.405
Um... if that's okay.

31:17.609 --> 31:22.279
Well, I can't meet with ray

31:22.281 --> 31:24.581
if I don't have a car, so...

31:26.150 --> 31:27.751
It's up to you.

32:31.650 --> 32:33.250
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:34.686 --> 32:36.019
What are we doing tonight?

32:36.021 --> 32:38.422
Maybe we should see
what Andy's up to?

32:39.691 --> 32:41.825
Yeah, actually, um...

32:42.493 --> 32:44.828
I'm meeting him after work
for a drink.

32:45.530 --> 32:48.198
<i>- You should come.
- Oh, where?</i>

32:48.366 --> 32:51.335
Uh, this new wine
bar right by my work.

32:51.602 --> 32:53.637
Oh, what time are we meeting?

32:53.938 --> 32:56.273
Um, well I'm meeting
him like right now,

32:56.275 --> 32:58.442
like right after work,
so I'm kind of worried,

32:58.444 --> 32:59.943
like if you tried
to meet up with us,

32:59.945 --> 33:03.113
I'm just worried we would
be done by then, um...

33:05.416 --> 33:08.585
Yeah, it's pretty
far on the bus, so...

33:09.454 --> 33:10.954
Krystal: <i>Well, I'll just
be there for a little while</i>

33:10.956 --> 33:12.222
<i>and then I'll see you at home.</i>

33:12.224 --> 33:14.191
<i>We can work on the website
tonight.</i>

33:15.426 --> 33:16.626
Yeah, okay.

33:18.062 --> 33:19.429
All right, that sounds good.

33:19.431 --> 33:21.431
Uh, tell Andy I say hi.

33:21.433 --> 33:22.799
Krystal: <i> Okay, bye.</i>

33:23.167 --> 33:24.368
Bye.

33:25.803 --> 33:28.205
- Andy: Hey, how are ya?
- Good, how are you?

33:30.441 --> 33:31.641
I didn't know you wore glasses.

33:31.643 --> 33:34.945
Oh, yeah, I'm blind as a bat.

33:34.947 --> 33:37.080
So is your whole family
like artsy or just you?

33:37.082 --> 33:39.783
Nope, they're actually all cops.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.852
All of 'em, they're all cops?

33:42.153 --> 33:45.655
Not to brag or anything,
but I do like to dabble in it.

33:45.990 --> 33:50.160
I want to make at least one
citizen's arrest in my lifetime.

33:50.162 --> 33:54.431
What? So you just like arrest
anybody, anytime?

33:54.565 --> 33:55.966
Anyone, anyone.

33:55.968 --> 33:57.167
Wow.

33:57.169 --> 34:01.004
Yeah, so how's...
How's your website going?

34:01.372 --> 34:03.807
The website, oh,
the website's great.

34:03.809 --> 34:05.008
Yep, very good.

34:05.010 --> 34:08.145
- Oh, great, good.
- Yeah.

34:08.147 --> 34:09.913
You got a chance to
talk to Glenn then?

34:09.915 --> 34:12.482
Oh, no, no, there
was no time, really.

34:12.484 --> 34:15.118
You should come hang out
with us sometime.

34:15.120 --> 34:17.920
They all dig ya, you know?

34:17.922 --> 34:20.590
Oh, they were so nice.
That'd be really fun.

34:24.228 --> 34:26.463
Should we...
Should we order another round?

34:26.597 --> 34:28.297
Sure, sounds good.

34:41.179 --> 34:43.013
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:43.014 --> 34:44.815
Oh my god, these
stools are, like,

34:44.817 --> 34:47.150
even higher than
before, aren't they?

34:47.485 --> 34:50.853
You really got
to, like, get up there.

34:50.856 --> 34:52.989
Oh, wow, strong
pour on this one.

34:52.991 --> 34:54.958
Yeah, they really did it, uh?

34:54.960 --> 34:56.326
Krystal: Wow.

35:00.865 --> 35:04.534
Uh, so you like want
to order any food or...

35:04.536 --> 35:06.369
This is a weird menu.

35:06.371 --> 35:07.904
Catfish tacos?

35:08.172 --> 35:09.739
I have a catfish story.

35:10.274 --> 35:12.309
My grandma packed up
all the lamps

35:12.543 --> 35:14.845
in her house
and just drove off once,

35:14.847 --> 35:16.513
because my grandpa invited
the whole family over

35:16.515 --> 35:18.215
for a catfish fry
and didn't tell her.

35:18.217 --> 35:20.417
But the worst part is that
because there was no lights,

35:20.419 --> 35:21.585
they forgot to
turn the fryer off,

35:21.587 --> 35:22.853
and five hours after
we went to bed,

35:22.855 --> 35:25.355
the whole house
caught on fire, whole thing.

35:26.190 --> 35:27.557
Did you put it out?

35:27.559 --> 35:30.127
Oh no, burned right down
to the ground, just dust.

35:30.129 --> 35:31.294
Andy: Oh my god.

35:31.296 --> 35:32.896
- Oh yeah.
- That's horrible.

35:32.898 --> 35:34.064
It is horrible.

35:34.066 --> 35:36.366
What did your
grandma say about it?

35:36.368 --> 35:37.601
Grandma?

35:37.603 --> 35:39.903
Oh, we never saw her again.
She never came back.

35:39.905 --> 35:41.438
Never saw her again.

35:41.606 --> 35:44.908
Oh my god,
that's a terrible story.

35:44.910 --> 35:48.745
Yeah, it is terrible, but
it's the truth, so there you go.

35:48.747 --> 35:50.780
Uh, this is weird.

35:50.782 --> 35:54.484
Uh, my uncle's house
burned down when I was ten.

35:54.486 --> 35:55.485
No way.

35:55.487 --> 35:58.054
Yeah, ceiling fan just
exploded, just Crazy.

35:58.056 --> 36:01.091
Do you think my grandma
burned down your uncle's house?

36:01.792 --> 36:04.261
Actually, yeah,
I think it was her.

36:04.263 --> 36:05.462
That makes a lot of sense.

36:05.464 --> 36:06.563
That's crazy.

36:06.697 --> 36:08.165
We're like soul-mates.

36:08.966 --> 36:12.235
We... I mean, we're friends

36:12.403 --> 36:15.805
and any friends can
turn into soul-mates.

36:18.142 --> 36:19.643
It just... you know.

36:20.411 --> 36:25.215
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, friend
soul-mates, uh, friend-mates.

36:28.886 --> 36:29.886
Oh.

36:30.922 --> 36:33.890
- Oh, sorry, I just, um...
- Andy: What, are you okay?

36:33.892 --> 36:35.358
Oh, yeah, no, my shoes fell off.

36:35.360 --> 36:37.427
- I just got to get...
- Your shoe fell off?

36:37.429 --> 36:38.705
Yeah, my shoes fell off my feet.

36:38.729 --> 36:40.597
I gotta get them
back on my feet. That's it.

36:40.731 --> 36:43.433
Just gonna, oh my
god, these stools.

36:43.435 --> 36:46.670
Ridiculous, you know,
just really tall.

36:46.672 --> 36:48.205
Just ridiculous.

36:48.539 --> 36:49.973
These stools are...

36:55.213 --> 36:58.281
All right, um...

36:59.217 --> 37:00.650
Can we get the check?

37:00.652 --> 37:02.152
Oh, I already got it.

37:02.353 --> 37:04.454
- Oh, when?
- Andy: Oh, a while ago.

37:04.456 --> 37:05.555
You already paid?

37:05.557 --> 37:06.957
Andy: Yeah, yeah,
I paid a while ago.

37:06.959 --> 37:10.260
Okay, I see.
There it is, yes. Um...

37:10.461 --> 37:12.462
You could have told me
if you were ready to go.

37:12.763 --> 37:14.531
No, that's not why I paid.

37:14.533 --> 37:16.566
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

37:16.568 --> 37:17.901
Andy: Okay.

37:18.102 --> 37:19.502
Well, I guess it's
getting pretty late.

37:19.504 --> 37:21.638
Yep, tick-tock, uh, we will go.

37:21.772 --> 37:23.306
Time to get back to the palace

37:23.308 --> 37:25.875
and I am turning into
a pumpkin, so, okay?

37:25.877 --> 37:27.644
- What?
- Should we go?

37:27.979 --> 37:31.181
Oh, uh, uh, yeah, sure.

37:31.183 --> 37:32.482
Just, here we go!

37:32.484 --> 37:35.619
Andy: Oh, oh, okay, yeah.

37:36.320 --> 37:40.223
Krystal: One last
time off of these, okay.

37:40.225 --> 37:42.359
Well, thanks for hanging out,
I guess.

37:42.361 --> 37:45.128
Yeah, of course,
thanks for coming.

37:46.030 --> 37:47.397
Yeah, thanks.

37:47.399 --> 37:49.299
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

37:49.734 --> 37:53.169
Well, uh... let me know

37:53.171 --> 37:55.438
if you want to hang out again,
I guess.

37:55.706 --> 37:57.641
All right, bye.

37:59.844 --> 38:02.145
- Okay, umm...
- Krystal: Bye.

38:02.346 --> 38:04.481
- Bye!
- Krystal: Bye.

38:56.133 --> 38:58.301
What do you mean
your shoes fell off?

38:58.303 --> 39:00.303
They fell off my feet
at the table.

39:01.238 --> 39:02.672
Sounds like you were drunk.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.974
No, I wasn't.
I had two glasses.

39:04.976 --> 39:06.376
Oh, boy.

39:06.510 --> 39:07.644
Krystal: <i> What?</i>

39:07.646 --> 39:10.947
I got poison Ivy.

39:11.215 --> 39:12.515
What?

39:12.517 --> 39:16.419
Yep, there it is,
all over the vagina.

39:16.421 --> 39:18.021
God, mom.

39:18.155 --> 39:19.322
How did that happen?

39:19.324 --> 39:20.957
Well I've been
gardening all morning,

39:20.959 --> 39:24.661
and poison Ivy is just
in the air, it's on the ground.

39:25.529 --> 39:29.632
You sit on the
ground, it goes in your pants.

39:29.634 --> 39:31.368
Then it just goes
where it wants.

39:31.370 --> 39:33.336
<i>I'll just have
to call my doctor.</i>

39:33.338 --> 39:37.173
Like, "hey, I'm gonna
need some Prednisone,

39:37.175 --> 39:39.342
for poison Ivy on the puss."

39:40.244 --> 39:41.911
I don't know what to do.

39:42.146 --> 39:44.347
Well, who is this person anyway?

39:44.349 --> 39:46.015
Has Donny approved of him?

39:46.017 --> 39:47.984
And does he have
health insurance?

39:47.986 --> 39:49.853
Um, I don't know.

39:49.855 --> 39:52.188
He's really nice, like,
really super nice.

39:52.323 --> 39:53.757
So he hasn't said,

39:53.958 --> 39:57.093
"oh, you don't
fit in with my cross-fit team,"

39:57.095 --> 39:59.662
<i>or "why don't you
die your hair red?"</i>

39:59.664 --> 40:00.797
No.

40:00.931 --> 40:03.900
Good, because that guy
was the worst.

40:04.268 --> 40:05.668
Yeah, I'm aware.

40:05.670 --> 40:07.570
No, this person's
completely different.

40:07.572 --> 40:10.473
He's, like, the nicest
person I've ever met.

40:10.475 --> 40:13.410
Then don't text him
and don't call him.

40:13.878 --> 40:15.178
For how long?

40:17.715 --> 40:20.917
Oh, I gotta go.
Dad's really mad, yeah.

40:21.886 --> 40:24.020
Okay, all right, bye.

41:08.265 --> 41:10.266
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:11.402 --> 41:12.635
Donny: You okay?

41:12.637 --> 41:16.139
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
Just tired for some reason.

41:18.108 --> 41:19.642
We should work tonight.

41:19.644 --> 41:21.978
We should work
on all of our projects.

41:23.380 --> 41:26.649
Um, yeah, actually, Andy and I

41:26.651 --> 41:29.085
are going
to this art show tonight.

41:31.789 --> 41:33.890
You're going to an art show?

41:34.825 --> 41:35.992
Mm-hmm.

41:41.832 --> 41:43.700
Um, do you want to come?

41:45.569 --> 41:46.936
That's okay.

41:46.938 --> 41:49.472
Uh, you guys go ahead.

41:53.777 --> 41:55.845
Well, I'll text you

41:55.847 --> 41:57.881
if we go somewhere else,
if you want to come.

42:00.784 --> 42:01.885
Okay.

42:21.171 --> 42:22.338
Andy: <i> I thought it was funny.</i>

42:22.640 --> 42:24.407
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

42:24.409 --> 42:26.309
I mean, that poor guy.

42:27.077 --> 42:28.311
That guy?

42:28.313 --> 42:29.712
No, what about all those people

42:29.714 --> 42:31.948
he was thanking,
like his parents.

42:32.082 --> 42:34.951
Oh, I know.
Oh god, it was horrible.

42:35.085 --> 42:37.220
- It's terrible.
- It was so bad.

42:38.989 --> 42:41.658
Uh, anyway, not
what I was expecting.

42:41.660 --> 42:42.792
Yeah.

42:42.960 --> 42:45.495
Um... oh, sorry I...

42:45.729 --> 42:47.564
Uh, couldn't make it out
the other night by the way.

42:47.566 --> 42:49.265
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

42:50.534 --> 42:52.268
Um, did you guys have fun?

42:52.903 --> 42:56.105
Yeah, I mean, I thought we did.

43:02.980 --> 43:05.515
I, um, found out that my manager

43:05.517 --> 43:07.283
may or may not be
doing anything.

43:07.484 --> 43:09.986
- Oh, no, what...
- Just nothing.

43:09.988 --> 43:12.355
- What's going on?
- Uh, I don't know.

43:13.991 --> 43:16.359
Do you want to do some shots?

43:16.727 --> 43:18.661
'Cause I think they're
a dollar tonight.

43:18.663 --> 43:20.196
Uh... yeah

43:20.198 --> 43:21.598
- okay.
- I do.

43:21.600 --> 43:22.865
Okay.

43:22.867 --> 43:24.701
Duh.

43:26.571 --> 43:28.571
- Linda: <i> Hello?</i>
- Hey.

43:28.573 --> 43:30.406
What's up, girly?

43:30.408 --> 43:32.041
Not much, what are you up to?

43:32.043 --> 43:33.543
Making pizza.

43:33.545 --> 43:35.211
Krystal: <i> What? What kind?</i>

43:35.213 --> 43:37.547
Uh... snickers.

43:38.048 --> 43:39.549
I'm making a snickers pizza.

43:39.551 --> 43:40.750
Really?

43:41.352 --> 43:43.186
Well, can I get in on that, or?

43:43.188 --> 43:45.021
Nah, I don't know.

43:45.155 --> 43:47.590
I think it's only big
enough for me and Frankie.

43:47.858 --> 43:50.860
Oh, well, do you
want to hang out later?

43:50.862 --> 43:51.961
Why?

43:51.963 --> 43:53.396
What do you mean, why?

43:53.897 --> 43:55.565
What happened with Andy?

43:55.567 --> 43:57.533
Nothing happened with Andy.

43:57.535 --> 43:58.868
Nothing's happening with Andy.

43:59.703 --> 44:00.870
He didn't call you?

44:01.071 --> 44:02.271
No.

44:02.273 --> 44:03.906
Do you have fraudulent charges?

44:03.908 --> 44:06.075
Krystal: <i>What, no, I'm
not calling about Andy!</i>

44:06.077 --> 44:07.710
I think you should check anyway.

44:07.712 --> 44:08.945
Where's Donny?

44:10.180 --> 44:11.347
I don't know.

44:11.782 --> 44:12.882
Oh.

44:14.084 --> 44:17.186
So you're saying you're
definitely busy, or...?

44:17.655 --> 44:18.821
Yeah.

45:19.484 --> 45:21.684
- I love fireball!
- Ugh, I hate fireball.

45:21.686 --> 45:23.119
What, are you kidding?

45:23.121 --> 45:25.455
It's delicious and it makes
your breath smell good.

45:31.529 --> 45:33.529
Ah, okay, uh-huh.

45:35.299 --> 45:36.599
Yeah!

45:41.839 --> 45:44.140
No, nope, I cannot do that.

45:44.274 --> 45:45.541
Ah, what?

45:45.543 --> 45:47.610
- I can't do it!
- What?

45:47.612 --> 45:49.011
- No, I...
- What?

45:49.013 --> 45:52.181
I had the worst hangover
on this. I can't, I'll puke.

45:52.183 --> 45:55.151
No, hey, uh, did you know?

45:55.652 --> 45:59.455
Smell, yeah,
causes more memories

45:59.457 --> 46:01.991
than all the other
senses combined.

46:02.459 --> 46:03.760
- Smell?
- Uh-huh.

46:03.762 --> 46:05.128
Okay, let's do it.

46:06.163 --> 46:07.630
Your breath does smell great.

46:07.632 --> 46:10.066
- Oh, thank you!
- Yeah, it smells really good.

46:10.068 --> 46:11.834
- That's really nice.
- Yeah.

46:24.582 --> 46:27.583
Donny: So, uh, Saturday?

46:27.585 --> 46:28.951
- Oh, yeah. Saturday.
- See you Saturday?

46:28.953 --> 46:30.019
Definitely Saturday.

46:30.021 --> 46:31.420
- Okay.
- It will be super fun.

46:31.422 --> 46:33.523
Cool, yeah, it'll be super fun.

46:33.525 --> 46:35.091
- Mm-hmm.
- Um...

46:36.360 --> 46:37.894
- Donny: Okay.
- Okay.

46:37.896 --> 46:39.061
All right, I'll see you then.

46:39.063 --> 46:41.197
- Okay, I'll see ya, bye
- okay, bye.

46:44.568 --> 46:45.735
Okay.

46:45.903 --> 46:46.969
All right.

46:48.105 --> 46:49.205
Bye.

46:49.540 --> 46:50.773
See ya, bye.

48:24.134 --> 48:25.268
Hey.

48:25.903 --> 48:27.136
Hey, what are you doing?

48:27.371 --> 48:28.771
Sleeping.

48:30.340 --> 48:31.440
I'm scared.

48:34.244 --> 48:35.678
Can I sleep on your floor?

48:37.481 --> 48:40.783
Okay, bring some blankets.

48:48.325 --> 48:49.458
Hey.

48:55.699 --> 48:56.999
Are you okay?

48:59.102 --> 49:01.170
I'm fine.
How was your date with Andy?

49:03.006 --> 49:04.240
It was good.

49:06.410 --> 49:07.810
I really like him.

49:09.913 --> 49:11.547
Did you guys have fun?

49:14.518 --> 49:16.085
Yeah, it was really fun.

49:20.023 --> 49:22.091
Do you think
I'll ever meet anyone?

49:28.932 --> 49:30.466
Of course you will.

49:34.671 --> 49:37.340
I wish we would've
enjoyed our birthdays more.

49:38.442 --> 49:39.942
I just wish
I wouldn't have wasted

49:39.944 --> 49:42.111
so much of my life with Scott.

49:43.580 --> 49:45.081
You didn't waste your life.

49:45.083 --> 49:47.049
It wasn't that much time.

49:49.753 --> 49:51.754
Remember when we said
that we were gonna live

49:51.756 --> 49:55.691
on the same street, next
to each other, in mansions?

49:58.895 --> 50:00.930
Do you think that's still true?

50:04.768 --> 50:06.202
Of course I do.

50:10.741 --> 50:13.242
Hey, do you want me to
stop talking to Andy?

50:14.978 --> 50:16.645
No, that's crazy.

50:19.616 --> 50:20.783
Okay.

50:25.088 --> 50:28.691
He invited us to go see
this band play this weekend.

50:31.995 --> 50:34.663
It's right next to
that hotel that we saw,

50:35.465 --> 50:38.200
the one with all the
themed rooms, remember?

50:40.637 --> 50:42.671
And I told him
we should stay there.

50:44.975 --> 50:46.275
Do you want to come?

50:48.045 --> 50:49.178
Sure.

50:51.381 --> 50:53.416
I don't want to
stay here by myself.

52:00.183 --> 52:01.450
Damn it.

52:05.923 --> 52:07.756
Krystal: Donny,
what are you doing?

52:07.758 --> 52:09.291
Nothing, you can come in.

52:13.130 --> 52:14.763
I didn't know what to pack.

52:16.700 --> 52:18.167
Did you get a haircut?

52:18.735 --> 52:21.537
Yeah, I was just
ready for a new look.

52:21.539 --> 52:23.339
Oh, I like it.

52:24.474 --> 52:27.476
I'm just used to seeing you with
the same one you've had forever.

52:28.011 --> 52:29.445
What's that box?

52:29.746 --> 52:31.247
Something I got for Andy.

52:31.249 --> 52:34.183
Oh, what for?
Did he get you something?

52:34.851 --> 52:36.085
Nope.

52:36.586 --> 52:38.087
That's really nice.

52:41.758 --> 52:42.958
Okay.

53:16.726 --> 53:18.460
What do you guys
want to listen to?

53:18.462 --> 53:19.595
Donny: Uh, I don't know.

53:19.597 --> 53:21.463
What was that stuff you
were playing the other day?

53:21.465 --> 53:23.365
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, here.

53:25.069 --> 53:26.969
Donny: Oh, yeah, so good.

53:26.971 --> 53:28.370
- Right?
- Yeah.

53:29.372 --> 53:31.440
What song is this? I love this.

53:34.277 --> 53:36.612
Donny, what'd you say, Donny?

53:36.780 --> 53:38.480
What...
What are you guys talking about?

53:59.769 --> 54:01.704
You want to see a vista?

54:01.706 --> 54:03.205
Who wants to see a vista?

54:08.012 --> 54:09.211
Okay.

54:10.580 --> 54:11.780
I'll be right back.

54:18.189 --> 54:19.288
Hey.

54:20.323 --> 54:21.457
Hey.

54:21.992 --> 54:23.859
I'm really glad you met Andy.

54:25.862 --> 54:27.329
Thanks, me too.

54:29.032 --> 54:31.333
He's like the nicest person
I've ever met.

54:32.502 --> 54:34.503
Yeah, I'm really happy for you.

54:36.139 --> 54:37.206
Thanks.

56:05.428 --> 56:06.729
Krystal: Hello?

56:07.931 --> 56:09.865
I don't know our room number!

56:31.955 --> 56:33.989
Wow, nice.

56:36.826 --> 56:39.695
I can see why they
call it the forest room.

56:43.533 --> 56:44.700
Oh, look.

56:46.336 --> 56:47.569
Maybe we should check out

56:47.571 --> 56:49.104
some of these places
while we're here.

56:49.106 --> 56:50.506
Oh, yeah, I heard about this.

56:50.508 --> 56:53.242
- They got great barbecue, yeah.
- Oh, wow.

56:53.810 --> 56:55.744
- Krystal: What am I doing here?
- What?

56:55.746 --> 56:56.979
Oh, nothing.

56:56.981 --> 57:00.549
Just making bad life choices,
that's it, just nothing...

57:00.551 --> 57:02.050
This is great!

57:18.401 --> 57:22.738
Um, I'm gonna head
down to the front desk.

57:22.740 --> 57:25.641
Um... you want to
meet me down there?

57:26.075 --> 57:28.110
Okay, we'll see you
down there in a minute.

57:30.313 --> 57:31.380
Okay.

57:39.622 --> 57:40.889
I'll be out in a minute.

57:40.891 --> 57:42.051
Krystal: Are
you almost ready?

57:42.559 --> 57:44.326
Donny: You guys go ahead.
I'll catch up.

57:44.328 --> 57:46.595
I don't want to go without you.
I'll just wait for you.

57:47.764 --> 57:49.531
Do you need help
with your bow tie?

57:49.533 --> 57:51.867
No, I can do it.

57:52.001 --> 57:53.602
Krystal: Maybe you
shouldn't wear it.

57:53.604 --> 57:54.770
Why?

57:54.772 --> 57:56.038
'Cause it doesn't matter.

57:56.040 --> 57:58.106
Andy's gonna like you
either way.

58:02.178 --> 58:05.481
Well, I want to wear it and I
don't want you to have to wait.

58:05.483 --> 58:07.616
Fine, we'll see you down there.

58:24.801 --> 58:27.669
I like that we sort
of match, sort of.

58:29.806 --> 58:32.074
I mean, okay, yeah.

58:32.076 --> 58:33.742
Like a little bit.

58:33.744 --> 58:35.711
- A little bit, maybe.
- Yeah.

58:37.413 --> 58:39.948
Um, sorry,
I tried to get Donny to come.

58:39.950 --> 58:42.317
He didn't want you
to have to wait though.

58:42.919 --> 58:44.486
It's okay. I'm fine.

58:47.156 --> 58:48.290
Totally fine.

59:06.142 --> 59:09.378
So, what's... what's
been up with ya?

59:11.514 --> 59:13.315
I've been thinking
about running a lot.

59:14.484 --> 59:15.684
Running?

59:15.985 --> 59:18.787
Mm-hmm, I'm thinking
about running a marathon.

59:18.789 --> 59:21.590
Well, like a full marathon,
like the full 26 miles?

59:22.091 --> 59:23.559
Yeah, the full thing.

59:23.561 --> 59:24.826
You know it's a lot of training,

59:24.828 --> 59:27.796
but that's something
you can... do alone.

59:28.631 --> 59:31.667
And, you know,
it's pretty rewarding,

59:31.669 --> 59:36.371
fills all your time, and I also
saw a meet-up group online.

59:36.373 --> 59:38.540
Get together with
other alone people

59:38.542 --> 59:40.375
and just, like, eat
cheese and crackers,

59:40.377 --> 59:42.911
and, like, talk about,
like, exotic fish and stuff.

59:42.913 --> 59:44.279
It should be good.

59:45.114 --> 59:47.683
Oh, that sounds interesting.

59:47.685 --> 59:50.619
Yeah, well, you
know, I think I just...

59:51.154 --> 59:54.756
I really gotta meet some
other people besides Linda.

59:54.991 --> 59:57.993
I also was looking
into tiger training.

59:58.761 --> 01:00:00.462
- Wow!
- Krystal: Yeah.

01:00:00.464 --> 01:00:02.097
That sounds dangerous.

01:00:02.365 --> 01:00:05.300
I guess. I think it just
depends where you go.

01:00:06.135 --> 01:00:09.538
Okay, well, it sounds like you

01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:12.374
got all your plans set up then.

01:00:12.376 --> 01:00:15.477
I think so.
Yeah, I'm pretty set.

01:00:18.147 --> 01:00:20.916
Okay, well...

01:00:21.718 --> 01:00:25.354
I just wanted to say
that I'm sorry...

01:00:25.356 --> 01:00:27.556
- Oh.
- For whatever I did.

01:00:27.558 --> 01:00:30.859
No, you didn't do anything.
I... I totally understand.

01:00:32.862 --> 01:00:33.962
Okay.

01:00:34.731 --> 01:00:36.498
You know, I'm really
glad you guys let me come.

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.600
Like, I didn't want
to stay home alone.

01:00:39.869 --> 01:00:43.071
Well, I mean, if you want, like,

01:00:43.073 --> 01:00:44.272
Glenn's throwing this wine thing

01:00:44.274 --> 01:00:46.408
and then afterwards we're
going to this brewery.

01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:47.876
You should come!

01:00:47.878 --> 01:00:49.578
- That sounds fun.
- It is fun!

01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:51.947
We do it every year.
It's a blast, it's awesome.

01:00:52.715 --> 01:00:55.450
Yeah, well, I'll ask Donny,
or I guess you can.

01:00:55.452 --> 01:00:56.585
You can ask him now.

01:00:56.953 --> 01:01:01.256
Okay, sure, yeah, I guess...
If you want to come,

01:01:01.258 --> 01:01:03.592
and Donny wants to come,
if that's what you want, yeah.

01:01:03.594 --> 01:01:05.661
Donny can come,
if that's what you want.

01:01:05.663 --> 01:01:07.796
I'll check my schedule
and stuff.

01:01:11.534 --> 01:01:15.437
Oh, well...
You're just inviting me?

01:01:16.606 --> 01:01:19.307
Um... yeah?

01:01:20.376 --> 01:01:21.510
Whoa.

01:01:22.445 --> 01:01:25.981
I was just kind of
hoping that...

01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:28.917
Maybe you and me could maybe

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:32.854
spend some
more alone time again.

01:01:32.856 --> 01:01:35.157
I mean,
only if that's what you want.

01:01:36.292 --> 01:01:38.293
Yeah, that sounds good.

01:01:50.773 --> 01:01:51.873
Hi.

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:53.875
Hi.

01:01:55.645 --> 01:01:57.479
I'm really sorry
about the other night.

01:01:58.147 --> 01:02:01.883
There's... there's been some,
like, weird confusion,

01:02:01.885 --> 01:02:05.120
and um,
this is super embarrassing.

01:02:05.254 --> 01:02:06.488
Um...

01:02:07.323 --> 01:02:09.891
The only reason, or,
sort of the only reason

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:12.427
that I came on this trip

01:02:13.629 --> 01:02:15.697
was that
I was hoping to see you again.

01:02:16.532 --> 01:02:17.966
Really?

01:02:18.201 --> 01:02:21.136
I just, I thought,
I didn't think you liked me.

01:02:22.171 --> 01:02:24.740
I just, like,
acted really weird and then...

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:27.075
No, no, you didn't.

01:02:27.610 --> 01:02:29.411
You didn't act weird.

01:02:31.013 --> 01:02:35.817
Maybe we can just like...
Just forget everything and...

01:02:35.819 --> 01:02:37.519
Yeah, that sounds good.

01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:04.212
You're actually talking to
the only person in high school

01:03:04.214 --> 01:03:05.847
that did not play
a single sport.

01:03:05.849 --> 01:03:08.249
I did. I was on the swim team.
I was like the slowest person.

01:03:08.317 --> 01:03:09.384
- What?
- Yeah.

01:03:09.386 --> 01:03:10.752
I was, like, basically
not even on the team.

01:03:10.754 --> 01:03:12.654
I was like the mascot.
It was the worst.

01:03:12.656 --> 01:03:16.591
Okay, um, do
you want another drink?

01:03:16.593 --> 01:03:18.393
Oh, no, I think I'm okay.

01:03:20.263 --> 01:03:22.307
I think I'm gonna get another
drink before the show starts.

01:03:22.331 --> 01:03:23.765
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:03:26.936 --> 01:03:30.338
Shit, uh, you think
Donny's okay, right?

01:03:31.607 --> 01:03:33.542
Oh, yeah, I think, yeah.

01:03:33.544 --> 01:03:35.377
Yeah?
Like he's just a perfectionist.

01:03:35.379 --> 01:03:37.746
He's probably just taking
his time getting ready.

01:03:37.748 --> 01:03:40.148
You think he's okay though,
right?

01:03:41.517 --> 01:03:42.984
I think he'll be fine.

01:03:44.687 --> 01:03:47.656
- Okay, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

01:05:07.169 --> 01:05:08.303
Hey.

01:05:08.638 --> 01:05:09.971
Hey.

01:05:09.973 --> 01:05:11.373
That's really cute.

01:05:18.447 --> 01:05:19.547
Thanks.

01:05:20.483 --> 01:05:21.650
What's going on?

01:05:21.652 --> 01:05:23.518
We can't talk to Andy anymore.

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:24.886
What, why?

01:05:25.688 --> 01:05:27.022
He's crazy.

01:05:27.024 --> 01:05:29.157
What?
What are you talking about, why?

01:05:29.159 --> 01:05:31.693
He's an asshole.
We can't talk to him anymore.

01:05:31.695 --> 01:05:33.929
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

01:05:35.632 --> 01:05:37.198
Andy: Krystal,
are you in there?

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:38.566
Don't answer it.

01:05:38.901 --> 01:05:40.235
I have to let him in.

01:05:40.237 --> 01:05:41.937
No, Donny, you don't.

01:05:42.238 --> 01:05:43.939
What did he say to you?

01:05:43.941 --> 01:05:45.573
I don't want to talk about it!

01:05:45.575 --> 01:05:47.943
Why won't you tell me?
This is really weird.

01:05:48.277 --> 01:05:50.111
How many times
have I texted you the code word?

01:05:50.113 --> 01:05:52.447
I wouldn't have sent it
if I wasn't serious.

01:05:53.716 --> 01:05:55.283
I know, but...

01:05:55.518 --> 01:05:57.886
Andy: Guys, what's going on?

01:05:58.287 --> 01:05:59.521
Krystal.

01:05:59.523 --> 01:06:00.956
Donny, don't answer it.

01:06:02.558 --> 01:06:05.994
Well, what do you want to do?

01:06:06.762 --> 01:06:08.163
We should probably leave.

01:06:10.032 --> 01:06:11.766
I don't know how
we're gonna do that

01:06:11.768 --> 01:06:12.934
because he drove us here, so...

01:06:12.936 --> 01:06:14.336
We'll take the bus!

01:06:14.971 --> 01:06:16.671
I'm not leaving.
I don't want to leave.

01:06:16.906 --> 01:06:18.039
Krystal: We have to.

01:06:18.041 --> 01:06:20.108
We can't stay here
with this person. He's not nice.

01:06:22.311 --> 01:06:23.745
Donny: I like Andy, okay?

01:06:23.747 --> 01:06:25.146
I'm not leaving.

01:06:26.615 --> 01:06:28.783
I'm sorry.
I'm opening the door.

01:06:28.785 --> 01:06:30.852
Fine, but if you do that,
I'm leaving.

01:06:33.956 --> 01:06:35.857
Are you serious?
It was that bad?

01:06:35.859 --> 01:06:37.392
Krystal: Yes, I'm telling you.

01:06:38.728 --> 01:06:41.963
Andy: All right, I'm gonna
head back to the show.

01:06:44.767 --> 01:06:46.201
Fine.

01:06:46.769 --> 01:06:48.203
Let's take a bus then.

01:07:43.459 --> 01:07:46.227
Herman, go to sleep.
You're making me sad.

01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:50.765
God.

01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:53.768
Come on, Herman, take a shit.

01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:56.371
You're five years old and
you're still scared to go potty.

01:08:16.258 --> 01:08:17.859
How was your weekend?

01:08:18.894 --> 01:08:20.261
It was fine, how was yours?

01:08:20.429 --> 01:08:22.964
Good, I got a new car.

01:08:23.698 --> 01:08:25.265
It's a Mitsubishi.

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:29.069
That's nice.

01:08:33.075 --> 01:08:35.243
Did you see, Andy?
What's wrong?

01:08:36.045 --> 01:08:38.613
Nope, we're not talking
to Andy anymore.

01:08:40.349 --> 01:08:41.448
What do you mean?

01:08:41.817 --> 01:08:43.118
Didn't work out.

01:08:57.099 --> 01:08:58.433
Are you crying?

01:08:59.568 --> 01:09:02.002
No.

01:09:03.606 --> 01:09:06.274
Krystal: Yeah, you are.
You're crying.

01:09:07.609 --> 01:09:10.845
I just thought he was
the one for you, you know?

01:09:11.546 --> 01:09:12.479
You did?

01:09:12.482 --> 01:09:15.042
I mean, you were saying horrible
things about him the whole time.

01:09:16.786 --> 01:09:18.786
Jesus, calm down.

01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:22.624
I feel really bad.

01:09:22.626 --> 01:09:27.295
I know how painful this,
that this is.

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:28.395
I'm fine.

01:09:28.398 --> 01:09:32.133
I gotta lie down.

01:09:43.145 --> 01:09:44.379
I feel better.

01:09:45.613 --> 01:09:46.948
Okay.

01:09:47.249 --> 01:09:48.750
You know, when
Steve divorced me,

01:09:48.752 --> 01:09:51.185
I went to Arby's every day
for three months.

01:09:51.353 --> 01:09:52.987
I was scared for a minute,

01:09:52.988 --> 01:09:55.089
but he's finally
walking again this week.

01:09:55.091 --> 01:09:56.524
Did I tell you?

01:09:56.526 --> 01:09:58.026
Krystal: Why couldn't he walk?

01:10:00.129 --> 01:10:02.363
Because of the roundhouse kick.

01:10:02.365 --> 01:10:03.998
What, you thought I was kidding?

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:06.234
Yeah, kind of.

01:10:06.835 --> 01:10:09.270
You want to tell me that
I taught middle-school Tae Bo

01:10:09.272 --> 01:10:12.340
for seven years, and I
can't deliver a nutcracker?

01:10:12.342 --> 01:10:13.408
Think again.

01:10:14.343 --> 01:10:15.977
I did not know you did that.

01:10:16.278 --> 01:10:17.845
You should do some.

01:10:17.847 --> 01:10:19.147
It makes you feel better.

01:10:19.149 --> 01:10:20.448
Watch.

01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:21.616
What?

01:10:21.618 --> 01:10:23.618
This is how I kicked Steve.

01:10:23.752 --> 01:10:28.223
You have to pivot
on the roundhouse, like this.

01:10:28.225 --> 01:10:29.958
You should put your hip
to the target.

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:34.395
It's like this,
like this, like this.

01:10:35.097 --> 01:10:37.465
Usually your hands are here
if you're defending yourself,

01:10:37.467 --> 01:10:40.568
but if you're not, you just
get momentum, like this!

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:43.204
That was a good hit.
It feels good.

01:10:43.206 --> 01:10:45.873
But, and, you, like, this!

01:10:46.675 --> 01:10:48.876
- Do you want my car?
- What?

01:10:48.878 --> 01:10:51.246
- It's a Mitsubishi.
- You'll like it.

01:10:52.314 --> 01:10:53.948
I hate working here.

01:10:54.383 --> 01:10:56.417
I saw some creative things
posted online.

01:10:56.419 --> 01:10:58.286
I think I'm gonna apply.

01:10:59.121 --> 01:11:00.221
Fine.

01:11:01.023 --> 01:11:02.390
Do what you want.

01:11:04.059 --> 01:11:05.560
I'm really proud of you.

01:11:07.596 --> 01:11:09.998
Maybe you can still come
to lunch and learn, though.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.400
Me, you, and Craig.

01:11:12.568 --> 01:11:13.635
Maybe.

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:15.570
Probably not.

01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:20.475
Hey, don't worry.

01:11:21.210 --> 01:11:22.510
It gets better.

01:11:24.813 --> 01:11:25.880
Thank you.

01:11:27.383 --> 01:11:28.816
Oh, man.

01:11:29.852 --> 01:11:31.519
Didn't think
you were home, Saul,

01:11:31.521 --> 01:11:34.122
cause I didn't see
my car outside.

01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:38.226
I still need it for a bit.

01:11:39.161 --> 01:11:42.096
Okay, is it parked on
the street or something?

01:11:43.532 --> 01:11:44.699
Yeah.

01:11:46.035 --> 01:11:47.535
All right, well...

01:11:47.903 --> 01:11:50.305
I'm definitely
gonna need it back today.

01:11:50.472 --> 01:11:51.706
Who?

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.474
Oh, no, I was just saying I...

01:11:53.476 --> 01:11:55.643
I definitely need
my car back today.

01:11:56.378 --> 01:11:57.512
Who's that?

01:11:58.547 --> 01:11:59.681
What?

01:12:00.015 --> 01:12:01.382
I called them.

01:12:02.785 --> 01:12:04.619
I called all of them.

01:12:05.487 --> 01:12:07.255
Ray was a fruitcake!

01:12:08.457 --> 01:12:10.191
Ray was a fruitcake!

01:12:11.193 --> 01:12:12.327
Saul?

01:12:22.639 --> 01:12:24.272
Hi, babe, what
are you doing here?

01:12:24.274 --> 01:12:26.207
It's a really bad day.

01:12:26.642 --> 01:12:28.409
Well, I ordered pizza.

01:12:29.211 --> 01:12:30.311
Hey.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:32.814
Hey.

01:12:34.283 --> 01:12:37.819
Why don't you guys
go to the park, take a walk?

01:12:37.821 --> 01:12:40.054
I'm not going
to the fucking park.

01:12:40.756 --> 01:12:43.524
Well, Krystal,
it's well-documented

01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:45.760
that exercise relieves stress.

01:12:45.762 --> 01:12:46.994
Look at me.

01:12:47.162 --> 01:12:50.765
I took that class
for yoga for all body types.

01:12:50.899 --> 01:12:53.368
I got enough serotonin
to fill the room.

01:12:53.836 --> 01:12:56.304
Besides, it's not like
you have Hodgkin's.

01:12:56.972 --> 01:12:58.373
You have a job.

01:12:58.841 --> 01:13:00.908
Donny's manager died today.

01:13:02.911 --> 01:13:04.145
Saul died?

01:13:04.813 --> 01:13:09.016
Yep, worst part,
he lost Donny's car.

01:13:10.119 --> 01:13:13.554
Drove it off
and couldn't remember where.

01:13:16.158 --> 01:13:18.159
So there you go, Krystal.

01:13:31.473 --> 01:13:34.742
You're always complaining about
working for a software company,

01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:36.878
'cause it's not creative enough.

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:39.113
Have you applied
for anything else?

01:13:39.115 --> 01:13:40.214
Nope.

01:13:40.216 --> 01:13:42.383
If you don't like your job,
quit.

01:13:42.718 --> 01:13:45.553
I told ya, you could do
anything you wanted.

01:13:46.054 --> 01:13:47.488
Please stop saying that.

01:13:47.956 --> 01:13:50.525
This is why I've been
delusional my whole life.

01:13:50.527 --> 01:13:53.127
Why did you say we could
be anything we wanted?

01:13:53.129 --> 01:13:56.297
Oh, I'm such a terrible mother.

01:13:56.299 --> 01:13:58.232
What I meant was...

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:00.401
I would pay for it.

01:14:00.569 --> 01:14:03.171
Why did you say we were better
than all of our boyfriends?

01:14:03.173 --> 01:14:05.406
They're all married
and going to law school now.

01:14:05.408 --> 01:14:07.208
This is why we're
never gonna meet anyone good.

01:14:07.210 --> 01:14:10.511
Well, you're not lonely enough
to meet someone.

01:14:11.513 --> 01:14:13.581
You spend all your time
together.

01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:16.317
I don't want to hang out
with myself.

01:14:16.319 --> 01:14:18.219
Char:
Well, you'll figure it out.

01:14:18.221 --> 01:14:20.221
This has been a pleasant dinner.

01:14:22.324 --> 01:14:25.026
Narrator: <i>The cunning python
waits patiently</i>

01:14:25.028 --> 01:14:28.062
<i>for the spider monkey
in this grassy knoll.</i>

01:14:32.101 --> 01:14:33.334
Narrator: <i> There he goes.</i>

01:14:37.439 --> 01:14:39.073
I'm so sorry about Saul.

01:14:39.075 --> 01:14:40.842
I didn't even know
he was that old.

01:14:42.945 --> 01:14:44.979
Well, he was
like a hundred, so...

01:14:46.782 --> 01:14:49.450
I mean, what did I think
was happening there?

01:14:49.952 --> 01:14:53.154
Well, it always seemed
a little weird, I guess.

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:00.161
Why didn't you ever
say something then?

01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:01.662
Krystal: I don't know.

01:15:01.664 --> 01:15:03.998
You seemed really excited
about working with him.

01:15:08.604 --> 01:15:10.137
What did Andy say to you?

01:15:12.241 --> 01:15:14.575
Just seems really weird
that he would...

01:15:15.444 --> 01:15:17.144
Be so nice and then...

01:15:20.249 --> 01:15:21.916
Did he say something about me?

01:15:23.619 --> 01:15:26.921
I mean, I just know
you really liked him.

01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:30.925
I just, I don't think
he felt the same way.

01:15:33.529 --> 01:15:35.930
I just didn't want you
to get your feelings hurt.

01:15:46.308 --> 01:15:49.210
I keep thinking of all
these things I wanted to say.

01:15:51.013 --> 01:15:52.446
Well, I'm sorry.

01:15:52.448 --> 01:15:54.749
I mean, I just don't ever
want to see you sad.

01:15:55.851 --> 01:15:57.385
But, I'm still sad.

01:16:03.692 --> 01:16:05.059
All right, well...

01:16:06.628 --> 01:16:08.396
No more lying to each other.

01:16:08.564 --> 01:16:10.498
Yeah, I know.

01:16:17.739 --> 01:16:19.140
Recip-easy sucks.

01:16:19.142 --> 01:16:21.342
I'm thinking about
getting my own apartment.

01:16:21.710 --> 01:16:23.244
You want to move out?

01:16:24.646 --> 01:16:25.780
I think I should.

01:16:40.996 --> 01:16:42.229
Hey.

01:16:42.231 --> 01:16:43.598
- Hey.
- Sorry I can't help you.

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:44.999
I just gotta go to work.

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:46.667
It's okay.

01:16:47.536 --> 01:16:49.704
I think I can get it.
It's not that far.

01:16:49.706 --> 01:16:51.706
Yeah, man, it's gonna be weird

01:16:51.708 --> 01:16:53.608
not seeing you
all the time though.

01:16:53.610 --> 01:16:54.842
I know.

01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:56.911
But seriously,
it's not that far.

01:16:56.913 --> 01:16:58.012
Yeah.

01:16:58.014 --> 01:17:01.716
Man, but what if you're busy,
and I need to talk to you,

01:17:01.718 --> 01:17:03.584
and I don't know
what you're doing?

01:17:03.885 --> 01:17:05.853
Well, I guess we
can call each other.

01:17:06.154 --> 01:17:08.089
Yeah, that's true.

01:17:08.523 --> 01:17:09.657
All right.

01:17:20.502 --> 01:17:22.737
- That sucked.
- Kid: Fuck you!

01:17:22.739 --> 01:17:24.572
You should quit.
There's no point.

01:17:24.574 --> 01:17:25.706
Kid: Duh!

01:17:27.242 --> 01:17:29.810
Ah, these kids nowadays, man.

01:17:29.812 --> 01:17:31.746
They just don't have
the Patience for piano.

01:17:31.748 --> 01:17:34.348
I know.
I totally get it. It's okay.

01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:37.952
Yeah, it's like they just want
to do video games and hockey.

01:17:37.954 --> 01:17:40.354
Mm-hmm, yep, I totally get it.

01:17:40.922 --> 01:17:42.423
It's like a dying art.

01:17:42.425 --> 01:17:45.893
Hmm, mm-hmm, yep,
mm-hmm, yes, it is.

01:17:45.895 --> 01:17:48.929
Anyway, I'll mail
you the last check, man.

01:17:48.931 --> 01:17:51.532
I'm really sorry.
Just, uh, give me a couple days.

01:17:51.534 --> 01:17:53.668
No worries, it's all good.

01:17:53.835 --> 01:17:56.070
Okay, thanks, Ted.

01:17:56.638 --> 01:17:58.272
- Bye bye, then.
- Bye.

01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:38.446
Hey, it's me.

01:18:38.448 --> 01:18:40.481
Uh, just got home from work.

01:18:40.483 --> 01:18:43.884
Just wanted to call and
see how your new place is.

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:48.956
Just, uh... give me a call
whenever you get this.

01:18:49.591 --> 01:18:50.758
All right.

01:18:51.259 --> 01:18:53.060
Hey, it's me again.

01:18:53.062 --> 01:18:55.963
Um, just calling
to see what you're doing.

01:19:06.843 --> 01:19:07.942
Hey.

01:19:11.279 --> 01:19:12.747
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:19:16.151 --> 01:19:17.651
I brought you some cookies.

01:19:17.653 --> 01:19:19.754
Aw, man, you shouldn't have.

01:19:20.355 --> 01:19:22.156
What have you been up to?

01:19:22.158 --> 01:19:23.457
Scott: Same old.

01:19:23.459 --> 01:19:24.992
Oh, I see.

01:19:26.328 --> 01:19:28.963
Well, I just wanted to...
Uh, come by.

01:19:29.097 --> 01:19:30.498
I mean, it would be nice

01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:32.733
if we didn't have to
avoid each other at work.

01:19:32.735 --> 01:19:34.301
Yeah, I hate that.

01:19:36.538 --> 01:19:38.372
I heard you and Randi
are dating.

01:19:38.374 --> 01:19:41.008
No, no, no, no, no,
she just follows me around,

01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:42.409
won't leave me alone.

01:19:42.411 --> 01:19:44.011
No, my girlfriend's in London.

01:19:44.013 --> 01:19:46.580
Oh, I didn't even know
you had a girlfriend.

01:19:46.582 --> 01:19:48.215
How long have you been dating?

01:19:48.217 --> 01:19:49.784
Yeah, we met online.

01:19:49.786 --> 01:19:52.453
Not a dating website, obviously.

01:19:52.888 --> 01:19:54.889
But, uh, we get each other.

01:19:54.891 --> 01:19:56.190
That's, uh, London.

01:19:56.192 --> 01:19:59.226
I mean, man, that must be hard,
like, not seeing each other?

01:19:59.228 --> 01:20:00.728
No, it's okay.

01:20:00.730 --> 01:20:02.897
Neither one of us really
want to get married,

01:20:02.899 --> 01:20:05.566
and, uh, we're kind of
okay just being alone.

01:20:06.134 --> 01:20:07.735
Okay, interesting.

01:20:17.345 --> 01:20:20.014
Scott: So, what's the deal
with Donny?

01:20:21.249 --> 01:20:23.284
He's fine. Uh, he moved out.

01:20:23.286 --> 01:20:24.885
He got his own apartment,
actually.

01:20:24.887 --> 01:20:26.187
Seriously?

01:20:26.555 --> 01:20:29.123
What are you gonna do now,
just gonna sit at home,

01:20:29.125 --> 01:20:31.192
have parties by yourself
with Herman?

01:20:31.593 --> 01:20:33.961
I thought you and Donny
were like Siamese twins.

01:20:34.362 --> 01:20:38.265
I mean, I'm thinking about
saving money and redecorating,

01:20:38.267 --> 01:20:39.867
now that it's just my space.

01:20:40.001 --> 01:20:41.368
You need some money?

01:20:41.636 --> 01:20:44.605
No, why... I have money.

01:20:46.241 --> 01:20:48.242
You sound just
like my girlfriend.

01:20:48.376 --> 01:20:50.211
She never lets me
send her any money.

01:20:50.612 --> 01:20:53.747
Okay, um, well,
I'm glad you're doing well.

01:20:53.749 --> 01:20:55.916
I mean, maybe next week
we could go to lunch.

01:20:56.418 --> 01:20:58.552
Yeah, I don't think so.

01:20:59.554 --> 01:21:00.754
Why?

01:21:00.756 --> 01:21:02.823
I mean, it's super cool
that you stopped by,

01:21:02.825 --> 01:21:04.491
but I don't want you
to think that you can just

01:21:04.493 --> 01:21:06.327
come over here
whenever you want.

01:21:06.728 --> 01:21:07.862
You invited me.

01:21:07.864 --> 01:21:10.097
Yeah, well, okay,
you called me out of the blue,

01:21:10.099 --> 01:21:11.265
and I didn't really think

01:21:11.399 --> 01:21:13.767
that you'd be staying here
this long.

01:21:13.769 --> 01:21:15.703
And I got other plans tonight.

01:21:16.004 --> 01:21:17.304
Krystal: Oh.

01:21:17.306 --> 01:21:20.841
Hey, hey, get off me!

01:21:20.843 --> 01:21:21.675
Jesus.

01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:23.010
Scott: Hey, hey,
get out of here!

01:21:23.012 --> 01:21:25.012
- What are you doing?
- Get off of me!

01:21:25.014 --> 01:21:26.647
What does it look
like I'm doing?

01:21:26.649 --> 01:21:28.215
Jesus, what's wrong with you?

01:21:28.217 --> 01:21:29.950
What the fuck do you think
is wrong with me?

01:21:29.952 --> 01:21:32.620
I mean, you come over, you're
asking me all these questions,

01:21:32.622 --> 01:21:35.055
like you're interrogating me,
like you want to run my life.

01:21:35.057 --> 01:21:36.457
I said that you could stop by,

01:21:36.459 --> 01:21:38.826
but then you're bringing
the dog over like we're friends.

01:21:38.828 --> 01:21:41.262
All of this, this is
why you fuck every...

01:21:41.529 --> 01:21:43.497
What the fuck is wr...

01:21:44.799 --> 01:21:46.967
Stop throwing cookies
in my fucking apartment.

01:21:46.969 --> 01:21:48.636
- What's wrong with you?
- I fucking hate you.

01:21:48.638 --> 01:21:50.237
Off my face!

01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:51.705
What the hell was that?

01:21:51.707 --> 01:21:54.241
What the fuck was that?

01:22:02.984 --> 01:22:05.219
Hey, where were you?
I tried calling you.

01:22:05.221 --> 01:22:07.321
No, sorry, I was calling you.

01:22:07.323 --> 01:22:08.432
I have to tell you something

01:22:08.456 --> 01:22:10.190
and you have to promise
not to tell anyone.

01:22:10.192 --> 01:22:12.059
- What?
- <i>Okay, this is really bad,</i>

01:22:12.193 --> 01:22:14.161
but I just beat the shit
out of Scott.

01:22:14.163 --> 01:22:15.162
You what?

01:22:15.164 --> 01:22:18.933
I roundhouse kicked him and I
threw puppy cookies in his face.

01:22:18.935 --> 01:22:20.734
Oh my god.

01:22:20.736 --> 01:22:22.403
I'm really worried that
he's gonna call the police,

01:22:22.405 --> 01:22:23.737
and I'm gonna
go to jail forever.

01:22:23.872 --> 01:22:26.106
I don't think he's gonna
tell the police

01:22:26.108 --> 01:22:29.410
his ex-girlfriend
threw puppy cookies in his face.

01:22:29.711 --> 01:22:31.211
That's pretty embarrassing.

01:22:31.213 --> 01:22:33.314
Yeah, you're right.
Okay, I feel better.

01:22:33.581 --> 01:22:37.117
Good, now, it's done.

01:22:37.252 --> 01:22:39.520
<i>Hey, do you want to meet up
in like 15 minutes?</i>

01:22:39.522 --> 01:22:41.021
<i>We should go
to that tapas place.</i>

01:22:41.023 --> 01:22:42.756
It's the one
with all those old doorknobs.

01:22:42.758 --> 01:22:44.224
I kind of hate that place.

01:22:44.226 --> 01:22:46.093
What, I thought you loved it.

01:22:46.361 --> 01:22:47.361
Sort of.

01:22:47.363 --> 01:22:50.331
Krystal: <i>All right, let's just
meet up in like 15 minutes.</i>

01:23:31.606 --> 01:23:33.207
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:23:34.976 --> 01:23:36.210
Are you ready?

01:23:37.245 --> 01:23:38.345
Yeah.
