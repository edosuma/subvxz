My sweet Cassie,

00:03.218 --> 00:04.967
You finding this means
I'm gone,

00:04.992 --> 00:06.404
and for that,
I am so sorry.

00:06.429 --> 00:08.007
I didn't want you
to have this life.

00:08.032 --> 00:09.917
But destiny's not easy
to run from.

00:09.942 --> 00:11.142
Hi, I'm Diana.

00:11.167 --> 00:12.684
You seen her yet?
She got in yesterday.

00:13.195 --> 00:14.586
We're different.
You're different.

00:14.611 --> 00:17.527
You're a witch. You're a
full-blooded, 100% witch.

00:18.079 --> 00:20.138
You're here.
We have real power now.

00:20.163 --> 00:21.889
A complete circle is 6.

00:21.914 --> 00:23.233
You complete the circle.

00:23.258 --> 00:24.458
She's got the gift.

00:24.483 --> 00:26.738
You can get Cassie
to do what we need?

00:26.763 --> 00:29.075
Circle will take care of that
without even knowing it.

00:29.312 --> 00:31.432
- How did you discover...
- We're witches.

00:31.657 --> 00:33.575
Diana found her mom's
Book of Shadows.

00:33.659 --> 00:35.627
She's the only one
with the book?

00:35.694 --> 00:37.362
That's the ferry that
killed her parents.

00:37.413 --> 00:39.831
Among the victims
was Heather Barnes.

00:39.882 --> 00:41.216
[Beep]

00:41.300 --> 00:43.418
Heather Barnes was on the
student council with Cassie's mom.

00:43.503 --> 00:45.087
I'm sorry Heather died!

00:45.171 --> 00:47.422
Heather didn't die.
What Amelia did to her

00:47.507 --> 00:49.808
was far worse.

Zachary said my mother
did something terrible

02:21.034 --> 02:22.001
to Heather Barnes.

02:22.014 --> 02:23.664
He said it was worse
than death.

02:23.714 --> 02:24.998
So, what did
you find out?

02:25.082 --> 02:27.834
After the fire, she spent two
years in a psychiatric hospital.

02:27.918 --> 02:30.053
Then she was released and just
dropped off the face of the Earth.

02:30.120 --> 02:31.304
Did she have any family?

02:31.389 --> 02:32.839
A brother in Finn Creek.

02:32.923 --> 02:34.808
No phone listing,
but he lives close to here.

Want to go with me
after school, check it out?

02:36.477 --> 02:38.144
Yes, of course...

02:38.229 --> 02:39.629
Wait.
I can't go today.

02:39.680 --> 02:41.147
Can't go where?

02:41.232 --> 02:42.649
Hey, you!

02:42.733 --> 02:44.467
Finn Creek.

02:44.518 --> 02:46.987
Why do you wanna
go to Finn Creek?

02:47.071 --> 02:48.938
We're trying to find out what
happened to Heather Barnes.

02:48.990 --> 02:50.190
She has a brother there.

02:50.274 --> 02:51.658
And you think
he knows something?

02:51.742 --> 02:52.909
It's worth checking out.

02:52.976 --> 02:54.477
But I can go by myself,
not a big deal.

02:54.528 --> 02:55.779
You don't
wanna do that.

02:55.830 --> 02:57.580
Finn Creek is a sketchy area.

02:57.648 --> 02:58.832
Adam, why don't
you take her?

02:58.916 --> 03:00.617
I can't reschedule
my counselor eval.

03:00.668 --> 03:02.652
No, it's fine. Really.

03:02.703 --> 03:03.953
I'm fine.

03:04.005 --> 03:06.339
Heather was in that
fire 16 years ago.

03:06.424 --> 03:10.877
Maybe she can tell us what
happened to our parents.

03:10.961 --> 03:12.128
Sure.

03:12.179 --> 03:14.030
I'll pick you up
after school?

03:14.098 --> 03:15.765
Ok...

03:15.833 --> 03:18.601
It's ok. Really.
We're friends.

What's the point of being
a damned witch if I can't

03:48.818 --> 03:50.467
do any magic by myself?

03:50.868 --> 03:52.502
I might as well
become a cheerleader.

03:52.553 --> 03:53.420
Bite your tongue.

03:53.504 --> 03:55.472
Why can't it be fun?

03:55.539 --> 03:57.674
Like that movie, "The Craft"?

03:57.742 --> 04:01.094
I mean the first half,
not the stuff with the snakes.

04:01.178 --> 04:03.897
The part where we put
spells on boys

04:03.981 --> 04:06.566
and change our hair color
and levitate.

04:06.650 --> 04:08.485
We should practice later.

04:08.552 --> 04:10.987
I'm kind of tied up...

04:11.054 --> 04:13.273

04:13.357 --> 04:15.892
Look, I know
you like this guy.

04:15.943 --> 04:18.495
But we both know
it's not going to last.

04:18.562 --> 04:20.029

04:20.081 --> 04:22.248
That's not true.
He can be sweet.

into your pants.

04:24.168 --> 04:26.953
He hits on every girl
in school and you know it.

04:27.037 --> 04:28.621
Don't be "that" pathetic girl

04:28.706 --> 04:30.590
who thinks he'll
change "for me."

04:30.674 --> 04:32.125
They never change.

04:32.209 --> 04:34.243
Ok, I got it.
He's a loser.

04:34.295 --> 04:36.896
I'm a loser.
You feel better?

05:02.623 --> 05:06.576
Oh, this is looking more
and more like a bad idea.

05:06.627 --> 05:08.211
We'll be ok.

05:08.278 --> 05:09.462
What is this place?

05:09.580 --> 05:11.131
It used to be
a little fishing village

05:11.215 --> 05:15.301
but most people moved away
and this is what's left.

05:16.303 --> 05:17.971

05:41.612 --> 05:44.664
Hi, we're looking
for Wade Barnes.

05:44.748 --> 05:46.749
Actually, we were looking
for Heather Barnes.

05:46.817 --> 05:48.668
But we know
Wade lives here.

05:48.752 --> 05:51.754
I'm Wade. What do you
want with my sister?

05:51.822 --> 05:54.857
My mother, Amelia Blake,
was friends with Heather

05:54.882 --> 05:56.082
when they were young.

05:56.544 --> 05:58.011
[Sighs]

06:00.197 --> 06:01.881
You knew Amelia?

06:01.966 --> 06:03.633
I knew her.

06:04.668 --> 06:08.304
My mother died
a few months ago.

06:09.773 --> 06:12.609
I was hoping to ask
Heather a few questions.

06:12.676 --> 06:14.344
Do you know where she is?

06:14.411 --> 06:17.063
She's right here.

06:17.147 --> 06:19.065
Oh.

06:19.149 --> 06:21.234
Would it be all right
if we talked to her?

06:21.318 --> 06:23.820
No. It wouldn't.

06:23.871 --> 06:27.407
Maybe that's something
Heather should decide.

06:29.326 --> 06:30.827
You think so?

06:32.997 --> 06:35.331
Well, then come on in.

06:51.432 --> 06:53.399
Stop.

07:01.275 --> 07:03.109
Ask her anything
you want.

07:10.951 --> 07:12.452
Heather?

07:23.881 --> 07:27.300
She hasn't moved
in 16 years.

07:31.722 --> 07:33.856
What's wrong with her?

07:33.924 --> 07:36.592
Years back there was
a fire at the boat yard.

07:36.644 --> 07:38.111
We know.

07:39.480 --> 07:42.365
Some died
and some survived.

07:42.432 --> 07:45.768
If you call
this surviving.

07:45.819 --> 07:48.037
Do the doctors know
what caused it?

07:48.105 --> 07:49.539
No one does.

07:49.606 --> 07:51.741
She went there
with your mother.

07:51.792 --> 07:53.543
Why?

07:53.610 --> 07:55.945
I don't know.

07:55.996 --> 07:57.519

down to that boat yard

07:57.544 --> 07:59.841

That scar on her arm.
It's witchcraft, isn't it?

09:55.330 --> 09:58.999
It's a Sigil. They're
used for certain spells.

09:59.084 --> 10:00.484
I've seen them before
in our research.

10:00.535 --> 10:02.152

what's wrong with her?

10:02.203 --> 10:03.420

10:04.422 --> 10:07.291
Zachary said my mother
did something

10:07.342 --> 10:09.042
to Heather that was
worse than death.

10:09.127 --> 10:11.044
Is that what he meant?

10:11.129 --> 10:13.163
Cassie, I don't know.

10:13.214 --> 10:15.499
Is that why
she grabbed me?

10:15.550 --> 10:19.336
Because somehow she
knew I was related?

10:19.387 --> 10:20.521
It doesn't make sense.

10:20.605 --> 10:21.838
Heather was her friend.

10:21.890 --> 10:23.107
Why would she do
that to a friend?

10:23.174 --> 10:25.008
We don't know
your mother did this.

10:25.059 --> 10:29.446
No...I do know.

10:38.206 --> 10:39.823
Where's your grandmother?

10:39.874 --> 10:42.526
At the hospital.
Working the late shift.

10:42.577 --> 10:43.994
She's a nurse.

10:44.045 --> 10:45.379
I know.
When I was 10,

10:45.463 --> 10:48.298
she set my arm
when I broke it.

10:58.426 --> 11:00.561
I found this.

11:04.566 --> 11:06.300
Is that what I think it is?

11:06.367 --> 11:09.069
My family's
Book of Shadows.

11:09.137 --> 11:11.071
I found it
when I first got here.

11:11.156 --> 11:12.889
But how?

11:12.941 --> 11:14.575
My mother left it for me.

11:14.659 --> 11:16.243
She wanted me to find it.

11:16.327 --> 11:18.078
I haven't told anyone.

11:18.163 --> 11:20.914
Can I see it?

11:27.755 --> 11:29.506
Each of the six families
has their own book,

11:29.574 --> 11:32.459
but we've only
found Diana's.

11:32.544 --> 11:34.911
Everything we know about who
we are, we got from her book.

11:34.963 --> 11:38.098
But it's specific
to her family.

11:38.183 --> 11:41.751
Different spells,
different histories.

11:41.803 --> 11:45.022
This book is
completely different.

so much from this.

I've seen it in here.

11:57.652 --> 11:59.453
Here.

12:00.371 --> 12:02.990
That's
my mother's handwriting.

12:03.074 --> 12:06.443
She had to be the one
to put the spell on Heather.

12:06.494 --> 12:08.295
I need to know why.

12:08.379 --> 12:10.747
It's a suppression
spell of some kind.

12:10.798 --> 12:12.549
Why would my mother do that?

12:12.617 --> 12:14.418
She would never hurt
someone like this.

If you really like Nick,
then I'll get on board with it.

13:10.425 --> 13:13.060
I promise.
The last thing I'd want

13:13.144 --> 13:15.596
is for you to think
I was jealous of him.

13:15.663 --> 13:17.347
Thanks.

13:17.398 --> 13:18.899
Sure.

13:18.983 --> 13:26.657
And by the way...I think
Nick got here early, too.

13:33.698 --> 13:35.499
You're a bitch.

13:35.550 --> 13:36.717
[Scoffs]

13:38.703 --> 13:42.923
No. I'm you're friend.

13:51.599 --> 13:53.650
The spell requires a poultice.

13:53.718 --> 13:55.235
And that would be?

13:55.320 --> 13:57.270
A magic potion.

13:57.355 --> 13:59.723
And I'm being serious.

13:59.774 --> 14:02.909
I have most of the ingredients
here except the main one.

14:02.994 --> 14:04.894
Which is blood.

14:06.230 --> 14:08.265
The spell maker's. Yours.

14:08.333 --> 14:10.117
You're cool with that?

14:10.201 --> 14:11.702
And, um...

14:11.753 --> 14:14.504
My mom used her blood
to begin with, right?

14:14.572 --> 14:15.922
If it was her spell, she did.

14:19.610 --> 14:20.677
Hey, can you do it?

14:20.745 --> 14:22.679
Because I'm like
petrified of needles.

14:22.747 --> 14:25.081
Ok.

14:33.591 --> 14:36.777
Are you going to do it, or are
you just keep torturing me?

14:36.861 --> 14:38.028
Ok.

15:02.637 --> 15:03.953
How's that?

15:06.474 --> 15:11.061
Hey! You're here.

15:13.231 --> 15:15.315
Adam told me what
you want to do.

15:15.400 --> 15:18.735
Yeah, you should have
seen Heather Barnes.

15:18.803 --> 15:20.904
- We have to help her.
- Are you sure you are?

15:20.971 --> 15:23.807
We're going to undo the
spell that was put on her.

15:24.692 --> 15:26.576
I don't think it's a good idea.

15:27.628 --> 15:29.579
What if we do it wrong?

15:29.647 --> 15:31.214
What if it hurts her worse?

15:31.282 --> 15:33.166
We'll be careful.

15:33.251 --> 15:35.569
How do you even know
what you're doing?

15:35.636 --> 15:38.955
My book doesn't even tell you
how to undo a spell like this.

15:39.023 --> 15:41.124
My book does.

15:44.095 --> 15:45.495
You have a book?

15:46.514 --> 15:48.598
It was her mother's.

15:48.666 --> 15:50.016
She left it for her.

15:50.101 --> 15:51.635
It has the spell.

15:51.702 --> 15:53.937
You're the one who always wanted
to know what happened to our parents.

15:54.004 --> 15:55.839
Maybe we can find out
with the two books.

15:55.890 --> 15:57.307
Not now, Adam.
Not for this.

15:57.358 --> 15:59.059
It's too risky.

16:00.478 --> 16:02.011
I'm sorry, Cassie.

16:02.063 --> 16:05.982
You can't do the spell by
yourself and we can't help you.

16:06.033 --> 16:06.983
Adam?

16:07.034 --> 16:10.237
We can help her.
You didn't see her.

16:10.321 --> 16:11.621
What my mom did.

16:11.689 --> 16:13.039
Please?

16:14.308 --> 16:15.826
I'm sorry.

16:15.893 --> 16:17.544
Maybe when we understand more.

16:17.628 --> 16:19.412
But right now, we
just don't know enough

16:19.497 --> 16:20.831
to do something like this.

16:20.898 --> 16:22.883
Diana.

16:27.004 --> 16:29.055
Let me talk to her.

16:35.229 --> 16:36.563
Hey.

16:38.733 --> 16:40.767
You having
fun out there

16:40.852 --> 16:42.018
with your
little chipee?

16:42.069 --> 16:44.521
What are you talking about?

16:44.572 --> 16:46.623
I saw you talking
to that girl.

16:46.691 --> 16:48.391
You mean Andrea?

16:48.442 --> 16:51.161
Come on, Mel.
We were talking.

16:51.228 --> 16:53.196
Didn't look like you
were talking to me.

16:53.247 --> 16:55.999
So now I can't talk to girls?
Is that the deal now?

16:56.066 --> 16:58.952
You know, I was
hoping maybe to get

16:59.036 --> 17:01.204
5 minutes before you
turned into a douche.

17:01.272 --> 17:04.007
What's going on with you?

17:04.074 --> 17:06.960
I thought things were good.

17:07.044 --> 17:08.744
You know what?
Faye was right.

17:08.796 --> 17:10.714
You're never
going to change.

17:13.017 --> 17:14.634
Go find another
slut toy.

17:14.719 --> 17:16.720
I'm done.

17:26.063 --> 17:27.597
What are you doing here?

17:27.647 --> 17:29.933
Adam and Diana just left.

17:29.984 --> 17:31.284
Why so pouty?

17:31.369 --> 17:33.570
You wouldn't understand.

17:35.907 --> 17:37.741
Try me.

17:38.910 --> 17:40.276
Fine.

17:40.328 --> 17:43.296
I want to undo a spell that
could answer a lot of questions

17:43.381 --> 17:45.081
about how our parents
died 16 years ago

17:45.132 --> 17:47.584
and Diana and
Adam won't help me.

17:48.586 --> 17:51.838
Boy, did
I miss a chapter.

17:51.906 --> 17:56.393
Wait a minute, is
that a Book of Shadows?

17:56.460 --> 18:00.096
You have your own?
[Gasps]

18:00.147 --> 18:01.731
I have looked and looked
for my family's book

18:01.799 --> 18:03.183
and I can't find it.

18:03.267 --> 18:04.351
That's enough.

18:04.435 --> 18:09.105
Oh, come on, don't
be like that.

18:09.156 --> 18:11.575
I thought you needed help.

18:11.642 --> 18:13.443
You're going to help me?

18:13.494 --> 18:17.146
Sure. If you let me read
your book, why not?

18:17.198 --> 18:18.415
You need my help.

18:18.482 --> 18:20.367
And to be honest, I
have never understood

18:20.451 --> 18:23.203
why we're not
better friends.

18:49.837 --> 18:51.287
Let's go.

19:08.588 --> 19:12.025
You conveniently left out
the haunted house part.

19:12.092 --> 19:13.676
Yes.

19:20.267 --> 19:21.701
Come on.

19:25.623 --> 19:28.441
This is really creepy.

19:33.330 --> 19:35.948
Your mother did this?

19:37.718 --> 19:38.885
Why?

19:38.952 --> 19:41.671
I don't know. That's what
I'm hoping to find out.

19:41.755 --> 19:43.456
I mean, seriously.

19:43.507 --> 19:45.908
What could anyone
do to deserve...

19:45.976 --> 19:48.394
Your mother must have been
one mean ass witch--

19:48.462 --> 19:50.313
Faye. Please.

19:50.397 --> 19:51.397
Can we just try
to help her?

19:51.465 --> 19:52.732
I'm sorry.

19:52.799 --> 19:55.134
Let's do this.

19:55.185 --> 19:57.270
I'm going to apply the stuff
that Adam and I made

19:57.321 --> 19:59.022
and then we'll do
the chant together.

19:59.106 --> 20:00.106
Will it work?

20:00.157 --> 20:01.157
I have no idea.

20:01.241 --> 20:02.158
I don't know what
the spell is,

20:02.242 --> 20:03.326
I don't know
what the words mean,

20:03.410 --> 20:04.827
I don't even know how
to pronounce them.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.446
Ok, we can do this.

20:06.497 --> 20:08.481
You dragged me all
the way out here,

20:08.532 --> 20:11.650
so let's get
to the bottom of it.

20:34.174 --> 20:38.394
"Rongaire balorum
eunarach vicit romnia."

20:38.479 --> 20:42.515
"Rongaire balorum
eunarach vicit romnia."

20:49.373 --> 20:50.656
Again?

20:52.826 --> 20:56.245
Rongaire balorum
eunarach vicit romnia.

20:56.330 --> 20:59.582
Rongaire balorum
eunarach vicit romnia.

21:06.039 --> 21:07.807
[Sighs]

21:10.043 --> 21:12.478
I'm sorry.

21:12.546 --> 21:14.097
I thought it would work.

21:14.181 --> 21:16.099
[Door opens]

21:19.653 --> 21:21.487
[Rustling]

21:59.777 --> 22:01.561
Maybe we did it wrong?

22:01.612 --> 22:02.728
Or I screwed
up the potion?

22:02.780 --> 22:03.980
Can we talk about
this in the car?

22:04.064 --> 22:05.565
Far away from here.

22:05.616 --> 22:07.066
Thanks for trying.

22:07.117 --> 22:10.486
I know I don't come across
like I care about much...

22:10.571 --> 22:12.238
But my dad died that night.

22:12.289 --> 22:14.624
I don't think my mom's
ever gotten over it.

22:14.708 --> 22:16.492
And I want to know what
happened just as much as anyone.

22:16.577 --> 22:18.244
I guess we're all
in the same boat.

22:18.295 --> 22:20.746
Yep, a boat full of sad witches.

22:20.798 --> 22:25.168
So how about we go back to your
place and check out the book?

22:25.252 --> 22:26.552
Another time.

22:26.620 --> 22:31.390
I'd say I've earned
a peek, wouldn't you?

22:31.458 --> 22:32.975
Yes.

22:58.669 --> 23:00.286
[Squishing]

23:05.492 --> 23:06.792
[Gasps]

23:08.629 --> 23:10.713
Heather?

23:10.797 --> 23:12.465
Oh, my God.

23:17.771 --> 23:19.722
[Heather breathing
heavily]

23:19.806 --> 23:22.475
[Grunting]

23:22.526 --> 23:24.360
Heather, what
the hell's happening?

23:24.444 --> 23:26.779
Aah!

23:44.589 --> 23:46.424
[Dog barking in background]

23:50.135 --> 23:51.285
[Door opens]

23:53.465 --> 23:55.683
Waiting to
catch me cheating?

23:55.767 --> 23:59.303
I came to apologize.

23:59.354 --> 24:01.805
I overreacted.

24:01.857 --> 24:04.308
You think?

24:04.359 --> 24:08.195
I saw you with that other
girl and I just went off.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.646
I'm sorry.

24:09.698 --> 24:10.865
Yeah?

24:12.334 --> 24:15.753
Faye was saying some things and
I made the mistake of listening.

24:15.820 --> 24:17.371
Like what?

24:18.457 --> 24:19.823
[Sighs] It doesn't matter.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.425
Just stupid things.

24:21.493 --> 24:23.844
It's not like you're my
boyfriend or anything,

24:23.929 --> 24:27.348
so I don't have
the right to be jealous.

24:29.718 --> 24:31.218
Ok.

24:34.339 --> 24:37.975
So...We're good?

24:38.026 --> 24:42.229
Yeah. We're good.

24:47.352 --> 24:49.787
I'm sorry for putting
you in the middle

24:49.855 --> 24:51.956
of this thing with Cassie.

24:52.023 --> 24:54.992
I understand why you
don't want to do this.

24:55.043 --> 24:57.861
I just know how badly Cassie
wants to find answers.

24:57.913 --> 24:58.796
You know.

24:58.863 --> 24:59.997
Well, I'm glad she didn't.

25:00.048 --> 25:01.382
Because I went back
to my book.

25:01.466 --> 25:04.168
I knew there was something about
that symbol that bugged me.

25:05.253 --> 25:06.804
Look at this.

25:06.871 --> 25:09.640
These are all ubilaz markings.

25:09.707 --> 25:13.310
Uh...really old, black magic.

25:13.378 --> 25:17.047
Demons, evil
entities...Possession.

25:18.049 --> 25:19.433
Heather was possessed?

25:19.518 --> 25:20.651
[Inhales]

25:20.718 --> 25:24.021
The notes here are all
about using snakes and insects

25:24.089 --> 25:25.889
as vessels for dark energy.

25:25.941 --> 25:27.992
Forcing them inside someone.

25:28.059 --> 25:30.444
I think the Sigils are meant
to keep it from coming back out.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.162
Like a suppression spell.

25:32.230 --> 25:34.532
This is way beyond witchcraft.

25:34.583 --> 25:37.334
It's seriously dark magic.

25:37.402 --> 25:38.886
None of this was
in Cassie's book.

25:38.954 --> 25:41.755
If she'd known about this, she
never would have tried the spell.

25:41.840 --> 25:44.408
That's kinda
the point I was making.

25:45.493 --> 25:46.710
I've got to call her.

25:46.761 --> 25:49.013
Why? She didn't
do the spell.

25:49.080 --> 25:51.599
But she still
needs to know.

26:02.227 --> 26:04.144
Ok, that's enough for today.

26:04.229 --> 26:05.779
Oh, calm down.

26:05.864 --> 26:09.066
Or I can take it home with me
and be out of your hair.

26:09.117 --> 26:10.067
[Sighs]

26:10.118 --> 26:11.986
[Knock on door]

26:16.041 --> 26:17.374
Mmm.

26:18.877 --> 26:21.579
Will you bring me
back some snacks?

26:21.646 --> 26:23.714
No carbs.

27:05.156 --> 27:07.341
[Gasps]

27:08.259 --> 27:11.178
Where is Amelia?

27:16.612 --> 27:18.313
Can you help me
find Amelia?

27:18.397 --> 27:21.282
She's not here.

27:22.284 --> 27:25.620
How did you...

27:27.206 --> 27:28.623
Are you ok?

27:29.625 --> 27:31.793
I need to see her.

27:32.961 --> 27:35.880
Amelia passed away.

27:35.947 --> 27:37.799
No.

27:39.284 --> 27:41.836
I'm her daughter.

27:43.789 --> 27:46.090
Cassie.

27:46.141 --> 27:47.809
Cassie.

27:48.977 --> 27:51.095
You were a baby.

27:51.146 --> 27:54.148
I tried to help her
take you away.

27:55.150 --> 27:56.467
She did.

27:56.518 --> 27:58.653
She took me
far away from here.

27:58.737 --> 28:00.938
She wanted you
to be safe.

28:00.989 --> 28:03.041
She tried to
leave that night.

28:03.108 --> 28:05.026
What night?

28:05.110 --> 28:08.112
Do you mean
the night of the fire?

28:08.163 --> 28:10.782
Can you tell me
what happened that night?

28:13.118 --> 28:15.870
She was trying
to stop it.

28:15.954 --> 28:17.839
She wanted to protect us.

28:17.923 --> 28:20.007
All of us.

28:20.092 --> 28:22.827
But it went inside me.

28:23.962 --> 28:25.213
What did?

28:25.280 --> 28:27.965
Evil.

28:29.802 --> 28:33.170
And I can still feel it.

28:33.222 --> 28:34.722
It hurts.

28:34.807 --> 28:37.141
Aah!

28:39.695 --> 28:42.146
Your mother
couldn't get it out.

28:42.197 --> 28:44.282
But she made
the pain go away.

28:44.349 --> 28:46.784
And now it's come back.

28:46.852 --> 28:49.687
Ohh!

28:49.738 --> 28:53.374
Can you please help me?

28:53.459 --> 28:56.160
How? How can I?

28:56.211 --> 28:57.829
[Crying]

28:57.880 --> 29:02.366
Please...make it stop.

29:02.418 --> 29:04.085
[Screaming]

Hi, sweetie.

29:57.523 --> 29:58.923
What?

29:58.974 --> 30:00.691
Who is this?

30:00.759 --> 30:02.927
It's Cassie.
I miss you.

30:02.978 --> 30:04.645
Come make magic with me.

30:04.730 --> 30:05.613
Faye?

30:05.697 --> 30:07.264
Why is she answering
Cassie's phone?

30:07.316 --> 30:09.400
Faye, just put Cassie on.

30:09.451 --> 30:11.035
She's downstairs.

30:11.102 --> 30:12.537
Faye, this is important.

30:12.604 --> 30:16.541
Oh, you sound hot.
What are you wearing?

30:16.608 --> 30:19.327
Does Diana know
you're calling?

30:19.411 --> 30:20.661
Faye, please.

30:23.832 --> 30:25.449
What happened?

30:25.501 --> 30:27.668
You fainted.

30:30.973 --> 30:32.507
Is that what my mom did?

30:32.591 --> 30:34.959
Is this how she
stopped your pain?

30:35.010 --> 30:37.061
Yes.

30:46.438 --> 30:51.609
I went to the boat yard,
but I couldn't find her.

30:51.660 --> 30:53.143
Why was she there?

30:53.195 --> 30:55.279

31:00.118 --> 31:01.168
What do you mean?

31:01.253 --> 31:02.787
They'd been summoned.

31:02.838 --> 31:04.705
They were trying to
use your mother's power.

31:04.790 --> 31:06.290
Her and her friends.

31:06.341 --> 31:08.175
Who was? Why?

31:08.260 --> 31:10.761
She couldn't stop them all.

31:10.829 --> 31:14.048

got inside me.

what happened really.

talking to me and then...

mother used to suppress

37:09.356 --> 37:11.524
the demon in
my Book of Shadows.

How can there be demons?

I just know we
have to be careful.

we don't understand.

We all do.

But after this,

we just have to be
careful how we get them.
