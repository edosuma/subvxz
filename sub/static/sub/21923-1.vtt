[thumping intensifies]

00:19.185 --> 00:24.774
[thumping slows down]

00:26.234 --> 00:28.987
[phone rings]

00:29.529 --> 00:31.197
Hello, it's Yance.

00:31.281 --> 00:34.034
Hello, it's Demitri Jones
returning your phone call.

00:34.117 --> 00:36.369
-Hi, Miss Jones. How are you?
-OK.

00:36.453 --> 00:41.124
I am not sure if you remember my name,
or my brother's name.

00:41.207 --> 00:42.876
He was a homicide victim,

00:42.959 --> 00:47.088
back in 1992, when you were with the
Suffolk County District Attorney's Office.

00:47.172 --> 00:49.132
-OK.
-His name was William Ford.

00:49.215 --> 00:52.135
You worked on the case
with Stephen O'Brien

00:52.218 --> 00:54.262
and Detective James Hughes.

00:54.345 --> 00:56.014
OK, what do you want to know?

00:56.556 --> 00:58.516
I was calling to see if you were willing

00:58.600 --> 01:02.187
to, within, you know,
your legal restrictions,

01:02.270 --> 01:05.022
answer some of the questions
that have been,

01:05.565 --> 01:08.443
sort of, plaguing me
for the last 22 years.

01:09.402 --> 01:11.821
No. I'm not going to do that.

01:12.781 --> 01:14.866
OK. Do you mind if I ask you why?

01:14.949 --> 01:17.233
Because as a prosecutor,
everything that

01:17.238 --> 01:19.621
happens in the Grand Jury
is confidential.

01:19.704 --> 01:23.166
-So I'm not going to discuss it.
-Sure. Right. No.

01:23.249 --> 01:25.376
I'm asking about the investigation.

01:25.460 --> 01:27.837
Yeah, no, I'm not willing
to discuss any

01:27.842 --> 01:30.173
of my prior cases on film
with anybody.

01:30.715 --> 01:33.134
-May I interview you by phone?
-No.

01:34.010 --> 01:36.429
-OK, and...
-I don't want to discuss the case.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.515
And you don't want to make any comment?

01:38.598 --> 01:40.558
I do not want to make any comment.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.977
-OK, Miss Jones. Thank you.
-Bye.

01:47.106 --> 01:48.691
My son...

01:51.820 --> 01:54.114
lying dead in a coffin,

01:55.907 --> 02:00.829
with the most peaceful look on his face.

02:04.332 --> 02:07.335
You, your sister...

02:12.674 --> 02:14.884
And I remember thinking...

Advertise your product or brand here

02:25.770 --> 02:28.690
"How are we gonna make it without him?

02:32.652 --> 02:36.698
How will our life go on, without him?"

02:38.533 --> 02:40.326
Even then,

02:43.454 --> 02:45.165
I was saying,

02:45.832 --> 02:49.210
"Wait until we get to court!

02:51.296 --> 02:57.844
I said, "This is a young man who has never
been in trouble in his entire life.

02:59.053 --> 03:02.307
Wait until we get to court."

03:02.849 --> 03:05.768
[Yance] So you were saying this
to yourself on the day of the funeral?

03:06.603 --> 03:08.646
"Wait until we get to court.

03:08.730 --> 03:11.774
This death is not going to be in vain."

03:12.567 --> 03:16.195
I'm not surprised
that the case didn't go to trial.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.866
I just want to know all the reasons why.

03:20.867 --> 03:21.701
[thumps]

03:21.784 --> 03:23.661
I'm not angry.

03:29.626 --> 03:34.339
I'm also not willing to accept

03:36.132 --> 03:40.178
that someone else gets to say

03:40.720 --> 03:43.389
who William was.

03:44.807 --> 03:49.270
And if you're uncomfortable
with me asking these questions,

03:50.188 --> 03:52.065
you should probably get up and go.

04:01.532 --> 04:05.328
[crickets chirping]

04:16.839 --> 04:21.928
All of the years that we were growing up,

04:23.471 --> 04:28.601
if we went through a section,
or passed a section

04:28.685 --> 04:31.145
that was predominantly white,

04:31.771 --> 04:32.814
you ran.

04:34.190 --> 04:38.903
That's when I started to realize
the economic difference.

04:38.987 --> 04:44.200
OK, so these people weren't wealthy,

04:45.410 --> 04:47.662
but their wealth was that they were white.

04:49.914 --> 04:53.543
My father's name
was George Alexander Dunmore.

04:54.252 --> 04:56.254
I was two when my father died.

04:57.130 --> 05:00.091
He had a severe asthma attack.

05:00.633 --> 05:04.220
He was taken to the hospital.

05:05.054 --> 05:08.558
There was a White waiting room,

05:08.641 --> 05:11.436
and a Colored waiting room,

05:12.145 --> 05:15.398
and even though he was critically...

05:16.024 --> 05:19.027
in respiratory difficulty,

05:20.486 --> 05:22.113
he was made to wait.

05:22.989 --> 05:26.451
And during that period
of time, he died.

05:29.662 --> 05:32.707
[Yance] Tell me the story of how
you met Dad. When did you meet Dad?

05:32.790 --> 05:35.126
[Barbara] Well, let's not say,
"When did I meet him?"

05:35.209 --> 05:38.129
When did I become aware of him?

05:38.212 --> 05:39.881
[Yance] What's the difference?

05:40.423 --> 05:44.927
Because I saw him
when I was in the sixth grade,

05:45.011 --> 05:46.679
and he was in the seventh grade.

05:48.389 --> 05:51.642
I did not speak with him

05:52.185 --> 05:57.857
until October of 1958.

05:58.524 --> 06:00.026
I was a sophomore,

06:00.860 --> 06:02.528
and he was a junior.

06:04.155 --> 06:07.825
And... where we lived,

06:07.909 --> 06:10.286
in Charleston, South Carolina,

06:10.369 --> 06:13.039
we always had a Coronation Ball

06:13.581 --> 06:15.458
at County Hall.

06:17.168 --> 06:19.170
Your father came over.

06:19.253 --> 06:20.880
He asked me for a dance,

06:20.963 --> 06:24.550
and he asked me that night
if I would be his girl.

06:26.052 --> 06:29.305
I tried to be cool,

06:29.388 --> 06:31.808
and let a few seconds pass

06:31.891 --> 06:34.310
before I said, "Yes!"

06:34.852 --> 06:37.355
I didn't say yes, I said,

06:37.897 --> 06:39.857
"Yeah, I guess so."

06:39.941 --> 06:43.736
You know?
But I was jumping for joy inside.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.531
Because I had loved this
man from afar

06:46.614 --> 06:50.118
since I was in sixth grade.

06:53.204 --> 06:56.249
[gentle music]

06:59.210 --> 07:03.631
[Barbara] We got married
July 10th, 1965.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.217
Now,

07:06.884 --> 07:10.930
I think that my husband...

07:11.013 --> 07:14.892
was a gorgeous man, OK?

07:15.351 --> 07:17.061
He was handsome.

07:26.154 --> 07:31.784
[laidback jazz]

07:37.206 --> 07:39.000
[Barbara] We moved to New York.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.466
I absolutely loved it.

07:49.260 --> 07:52.763
We found an apartment in Brooklyn.

07:57.351 --> 08:00.313
I enjoyed it immensely.

08:04.525 --> 08:07.612
It was the kind of apartment building

08:07.695 --> 08:12.158
that had a lot of old Jewish ladies
who lived there.

08:12.658 --> 08:15.828
And they would line up
in front of the window

08:16.329 --> 08:18.831
in the afternoon, and they'd sit there.

08:20.666 --> 08:23.794
They were wonderful.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.174
I remember coming home one day,

08:28.257 --> 08:30.176
and one of them said,

08:30.259 --> 08:33.596
"It looks as if
you're going to have a baby!"

08:33.679 --> 08:37.475
I said, "Oh, my goodness,
I thought I was hiding it."

08:38.726 --> 08:41.562
I was elated, you know.

08:41.645 --> 08:44.607
And when I sang he would get quiet,

08:45.149 --> 08:48.861
and when I stopped,
he would move a little.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.572
And if I didn't start right back up,

08:51.656 --> 08:55.618
his little feet and hands would be moving.

08:59.622 --> 09:02.917
William was born in 1967.

09:06.379 --> 09:10.424
Your father would say,
"That boy's gonna be so spoiled."

09:10.841 --> 09:13.678
He was. He was.

09:14.804 --> 09:18.140
[gentle music]

09:34.865 --> 09:37.702
[Barbara] I made an "A"
on the national teachers exam.

09:38.661 --> 09:41.414
I loved teaching.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.082
I loved it.

09:43.165 --> 09:47.920
Because I knew what being educated

09:48.462 --> 09:52.592
had done for my sisters and me.

09:54.594 --> 09:58.472
And I also knew the struggle.

09:58.556 --> 10:02.018
My mom stripped tobacco for a living,

10:02.643 --> 10:03.811
OK?

10:03.894 --> 10:07.732
She left school in the fourth grade,

10:08.649 --> 10:10.276
and went to work.

10:10.359 --> 10:12.778
I helped her learn how to read.

10:13.571 --> 10:15.448
I think she had no shame with me,

10:16.365 --> 10:18.284
because I was the youngest.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.995
And I was proud

10:21.537 --> 10:25.499
that I could help her
read and write.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.523
[Yance] My mother started
out her career

10:31.528 --> 10:33.549
in New York City as an
English teacher,

10:33.633 --> 10:36.044
and worked her way up to
become Principal

10:36.049 --> 10:37.970
of Thomas Jefferson
High School

10:38.054 --> 10:39.722
in East New York.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.140
After 13 years there,

10:41.724 --> 10:46.187
she opened a school
for girls and women at Rikers,

10:46.270 --> 10:48.564
the jail that sits in...

10:49.190 --> 10:52.985
essentially at the end of the runway
at LaGuardia Airport.

10:56.405 --> 10:58.824
[ambient music]

10:58.908 --> 11:02.870
[Yance] She named it Rosewood,
and she developed programs

11:02.953 --> 11:06.707
that helped women leave prison
with skills,

11:06.791 --> 11:10.711
so that they would have options
when they got out of prison.

11:13.089 --> 11:17.593
And my father just believed

11:17.676 --> 11:20.179
in my mother's ability to do anything.

11:22.515 --> 11:26.102
[Barbara] Your father worked
at Andrew Geller's.

11:27.019 --> 11:28.854
Fabulous shoes.

11:29.397 --> 11:34.068
Fantastic, beautiful shoes,
and I loved them.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.699
He wanted to be a draftsman.

11:44.620 --> 11:48.541
He took the test for the
Transit Authority

11:48.624 --> 11:50.167
to become a motorman...

11:52.086 --> 11:54.296
but he could still go to school.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.343
Then you were born.

12:01.804 --> 12:03.931
When Lauren was born,

12:04.807 --> 12:06.475
he was overjoyed.

12:07.017 --> 12:10.479
He was overjoyed.

12:12.064 --> 12:15.568
But as you guys grew,
you were so rambunctious.

12:18.821 --> 12:22.241
We were looking for an apartment.

12:22.575 --> 12:25.578
We looked in Brooklyn.

12:26.579 --> 12:31.167
Nothing that we found
did your father like.

12:32.126 --> 12:35.838
He did not like anything that we found.

12:35.921 --> 12:41.886
I must not have spoken to him
for a month, OK?

12:41.969 --> 12:45.681
I would put pillows
in the middle of the bed,

12:46.724 --> 12:48.601
because it meant that

12:49.226 --> 12:51.270
we had to keep looking,

12:51.353 --> 12:55.691
and at the time, I did not know
how dead set he was

12:55.774 --> 12:57.693
on moving to Long Island.

13:01.238 --> 13:03.115
[Yance] My father drove the J Train,

13:04.033 --> 13:06.381
which ran on a loop through
some of the

13:06.386 --> 13:08.537
toughest neighborhoods
in the city.

13:11.373 --> 13:13.402
From his motorman's
cabin, he saw a

13:13.407 --> 13:15.628
very different New York
than my mother.

13:17.129 --> 13:20.341
He saw poverty, and crime,

13:21.300 --> 13:22.760
and violence,

13:24.136 --> 13:25.930
and a rapidly declining city.

13:28.682 --> 13:30.935
My father was not a fearful man.

13:31.810 --> 13:33.354
He was a realist.

13:36.190 --> 13:39.151
He had already gotten out
of the Jim Crow South in one piece,

13:39.235 --> 13:42.738
and he didn't want to put
his family or our future at risk.

13:43.572 --> 13:46.700
[Barbara] We came out one Saturday,

13:47.326 --> 13:49.537
and met Sam McCollough.

13:49.620 --> 13:52.873
Nice, you know. He lived in the community.

13:53.999 --> 13:57.545
He was the agent for the company

13:57.628 --> 14:00.548
that bought this land
and built the houses.

14:01.131 --> 14:06.095
I was told later
that they wanted to attract...

14:07.137 --> 14:12.059
people who were employed
by the city, you know,

14:12.601 --> 14:16.272
whom they thought could afford the homes.

14:17.273 --> 14:21.443
A lot of... African Americans

14:21.527 --> 14:23.571
were moving out to Long Island.

14:24.196 --> 14:29.326
Civil servants, like bus drivers,
police officers, correction officers...

14:31.453 --> 14:36.125
and they would put them in pockets,
or neighborhoods in the different towns.

14:36.208 --> 14:37.835
You could go to certain towns...

14:37.918 --> 14:42.172
go to Deer Park and find the same "new D,"
Amityville, find the same "new D,"

14:42.256 --> 14:46.927
but all the rest of Long Island
was, you know, predominantly white.

14:47.011 --> 14:50.472
So in that one neighborhood,

14:51.015 --> 14:52.308
it was a haven.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.060
When you would go out, you know...

14:56.854 --> 14:59.565
you might be running back for your life,
you know?

15:01.066 --> 15:03.611
Growing up
in a new development, a "new D"...

15:04.570 --> 15:06.155
was beautiful.

15:06.822 --> 15:08.365
It was wonderful.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.200
It was safe.

15:14.830 --> 15:19.335
[Barbara] I really,
really did not like it.

15:20.461 --> 15:22.004
Everybody was black.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.764
-[Yance] You think that
was an accident?

15:23.769 --> 15:24.924
-[Barbara] Of course not.

15:25.591 --> 15:26.467
But...

15:29.094 --> 15:30.638
I guess...

15:33.057 --> 15:35.476
not having grown up...

15:36.268 --> 15:42.149
in a home that belonged to us as a family,

15:43.484 --> 15:45.903
I wanted to ensure

15:45.986 --> 15:50.366
that you guys had it differently.

15:53.035 --> 15:55.287
This has been our home:

15:55.371 --> 15:59.416
147 Cone Avenue, Central Islip.

15:59.500 --> 16:02.753
[ice cream van playing tinkling music]

16:07.383 --> 16:10.260
[music continues]

16:15.933 --> 16:19.937
When they moved to the neighborhood
where I grew up in Central Islip,

16:20.688 --> 16:23.941
it was essentially moving back
into a segregated community.

16:25.818 --> 16:29.488
Segregation draws a line
around not just your neighborhood,

16:29.571 --> 16:30.906
but your life.

16:33.242 --> 16:37.454
"Sorry, you can't have more.
Sorry, you can't earn more.

16:37.997 --> 16:42.292
You can't shop here.
You can't live here. You can't move here.

16:42.376 --> 16:43.460
This is it for you."

16:46.964 --> 16:50.217
[Yance] While the houses were
affordably priced, it was deceptive.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.971
The taxes were high
and the public schools were bad.

16:55.597 --> 16:58.350
And now, on top of a mortgage
and car payments,

16:58.892 --> 17:01.729
they had to pay
a combined 36 years of tuition

17:01.812 --> 17:04.481
to put three kids through
Catholic school.

17:11.405 --> 17:15.492
[Barbara] The bottom line was,
your father had to leave college.

17:15.576 --> 17:17.327
It got too much for him.

17:17.869 --> 17:20.539
He started working the night shift.

17:22.040 --> 17:26.462
Sometimes I'd be coming down
the Southern State, coming home,

17:26.545 --> 17:28.422
and he'd be going in.

17:28.505 --> 17:32.134
I would blow at him, he'd blow at me
and we would wave, you know.

17:32.217 --> 17:37.097
And for many, many, many years,
that's the way it was.

17:37.639 --> 17:40.309
I think it was good for you guys,

17:40.851 --> 17:45.022
but not good for a
marriage to thrive.

17:47.441 --> 17:49.151
[Ray Charles: "Let the Good Times Roll"]

17:49.234 --> 17:53.155
Hey, everybody
Let's have some fun

17:53.238 --> 17:57.242
You only live but once
And when you're dead, you're done

17:57.326 --> 17:59.787
 So let the good times roll

18:01.497 --> 18:03.499
I said, let the good times roll

18:07.002 --> 18:09.171
I don't care if you're young or old

18:09.254 --> 18:12.257
 You ought to get together
Let the good times roll

18:17.971 --> 18:21.767
[Yance] I loved that my mother,
especially,

18:22.434 --> 18:26.230
made it really clear that, no matter what,

18:27.272 --> 18:29.316
my brother, my sister and I,

18:29.399 --> 18:32.361
our principal job in life
was to love each other.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.405
I'm grateful for that directive.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.991
It's one of the reasons
why I miss my brother so much.

18:45.040 --> 18:48.293
William was seven years older than I was,

18:48.377 --> 18:50.796
and that is fantastic.

18:51.380 --> 18:54.633
Being nine years old
and having a 16-year-old brother

18:54.716 --> 18:57.136
who can get you into R-rated movies

18:57.219 --> 18:59.888
and buy you comic books,

18:59.972 --> 19:02.891
and be able to drive you around...

19:02.975 --> 19:06.395
He would look at me and say,
"Kato, we're on a mission."

19:06.478 --> 19:08.355
No matter what we were doing.

19:08.438 --> 19:11.400
We could be going
to the grocery store to pick up...

19:12.526 --> 19:15.529
wax paper, you know,
and he was like, "We're on a mission."

19:15.612 --> 19:18.323
[male narrator] Another challenge
for the Green Hornet,

19:18.407 --> 19:22.035
his aide, Kato, and their rolling
arsenal, the Black Beauty.

19:22.786 --> 19:25.205
[Lauren] Kato was
the Green Hornet's sidekick.

19:25.289 --> 19:26.915
Kato was played by Bruce Lee.

19:27.958 --> 19:31.461
We grew up watching
old-school Batman and Robin,

19:31.545 --> 19:33.672
and The Green Hornet.

19:33.755 --> 19:36.216
Hornet gun. Let's roll, Kato.

19:36.925 --> 19:39.970
Being called Kato was like,
an honor, you know,

19:40.053 --> 19:41.680
because Bruce Lee was awesome.

19:41.763 --> 19:46.185
We both loved martial arts, you know,
and comic books and stuff like that.

19:46.268 --> 19:48.353
We'd, like, pass them around

19:48.437 --> 19:51.481
and say, "Look at this.
Do you see the artwork on this one?"

19:51.565 --> 19:54.193
"Oh, did you see the plotline on this one?
Oh, man!

19:54.276 --> 19:56.445
They're going to kill this guy off? No!"

19:56.528 --> 19:57.738
You know?

19:58.655 --> 20:00.574
It was just awesome.

20:03.619 --> 20:06.455
[Kevin] Football is how we met.

20:07.831 --> 20:11.877
His dad and my dad,
and his self and myself,

20:11.960 --> 20:13.921
were all on the same team.

20:14.004 --> 20:16.757
And that's how we began
our friendship.

20:17.299 --> 20:20.594
Ford was a center, I was
a defensive end,

20:21.136 --> 20:23.358
and we used to rely on
each other for

20:23.363 --> 20:25.390
rides back and forth
to practice.

20:25.474 --> 20:26.308
[Kevin laughs]

20:26.391 --> 20:30.103
From that time... until he passed away,

20:30.187 --> 20:32.981
I would pretty much say
we were pretty much inseparable.

20:35.525 --> 20:36.526
Me and William.

20:38.528 --> 20:40.822
[Kevin] Ford was protective
of those around him,

20:40.906 --> 20:42.699
especially his sisters.

20:43.992 --> 20:46.286
[Lauren] I was 15.

20:46.370 --> 20:50.207
He was the first person to tell me
I looked pretty, you know?

20:50.290 --> 20:52.334
He's like, "Now look at yourself."

20:54.169 --> 20:56.588
And he's like, "You're pretty."

20:59.091 --> 21:02.761
And I'm like, "No, I'm not."
And he's like, "Yes, yes, you are."

21:06.139 --> 21:08.016
That's just something I never forgot.

21:14.606 --> 21:18.485
[Yance] My parents wanted
to raise remarkable kids.

21:19.278 --> 21:22.781
Our blackness, and what it meant
to be black in America,

21:22.864 --> 21:25.075
and how to survive being
black in America,

21:25.158 --> 21:28.578
and the resilience that needed
to be black in America,

21:28.662 --> 21:30.330
as well as the pride,

21:30.414 --> 21:31.976
was something that
our parents

21:31.981 --> 21:33.834
instilled in us
extraordinarily well.

21:34.501 --> 21:38.380
But it didn't occur to them
that there were other things

21:38.463 --> 21:40.465
that their kids might struggle with.

21:43.010 --> 21:46.388
William's room had been directly
across the hall from my parents.

21:46.471 --> 21:49.182
He quickly...

21:52.102 --> 21:53.020
[sighs]

21:53.103 --> 21:55.230
OK, what I remember...

22:03.405 --> 22:07.617
There are five steps
from the main level of the house

22:07.701 --> 22:09.328
down into the basement.

22:10.662 --> 22:13.749
By that summer,
William had moved to the basement.

22:13.832 --> 22:15.876
I would sneak into William's room

22:15.959 --> 22:19.504
and I'd read his magazines, and...

22:20.547 --> 22:22.883
You know, I read a lot of Playboy...

22:24.217 --> 22:25.343
that summer!

22:26.136 --> 22:30.265
I read a lot of Forum magazine
that summer.

22:34.519 --> 22:35.854
And...

22:36.938 --> 22:40.692
that was something that I...

22:41.943 --> 22:43.361
felt, really...

22:44.362 --> 22:45.739
both...

22:47.991 --> 22:50.994
excited by, and ashamed of.

22:54.748 --> 22:56.875
Because I knew I was queer,

22:56.958 --> 23:00.003
and there was no one
to talk about it with.

23:00.087 --> 23:05.842
[all sing] Happy birthday,
dear Yance!

23:05.926 --> 23:10.180
Happy birthday to you!

23:10.263 --> 23:12.682
[cheering, applause]

23:14.684 --> 23:19.856
[The Crests: "Sixteen Candles" playing]

23:22.651 --> 23:25.737
[Yance] I never asked...
I never asked my parents questions.

23:28.281 --> 23:30.700
You know, we had health
class in school,

23:30.784 --> 23:34.538
so I learned about sex
and childbirth...

23:35.539 --> 23:37.207
from Catholic nuns.

23:38.917 --> 23:42.546
Instead of going to math class,
I went to the library and found...

23:42.629 --> 23:44.464
you know, Rita Mae Brown books,

23:44.548 --> 23:47.592
and even though they were corny,
I read those.

23:48.552 --> 23:51.513
That's how I learned that there were
other gay people in the world.

23:55.725 --> 23:58.478
I never told William
that I was queer,

24:00.438 --> 24:01.940
and I wish I had.

24:08.238 --> 24:12.450
That's right, the basement room
was my brother's last room,

24:12.534 --> 24:14.369
and he was living at home,

24:15.829 --> 24:17.164
when he was killed.

24:22.836 --> 24:24.462
[Lauren] I think it was a weekend,

24:24.546 --> 24:28.425
because William and Lesline
had taken me bowling.

24:29.467 --> 24:31.011
It was a fun night.

24:31.094 --> 24:33.597
I bowled a 96.

24:35.098 --> 24:36.683
On the way back,

24:37.475 --> 24:39.102
I was sitting behind William.

24:39.186 --> 24:40.854
Lesline was driving.

24:41.479 --> 24:45.734
We were going to take the shortcut
onto Brightside, and as we were turning,

24:45.817 --> 24:50.113
I saw this tow truck
that didn't have any lights on,

24:51.198 --> 24:54.618
and before I could say, "Look out,"

24:55.327 --> 24:57.746
bam, we were in a car accident.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.376
[Lauren] William helped
me out of the car.

25:03.460 --> 25:05.045
He asked me if I was OK.

25:06.129 --> 25:07.631
I said yes,

25:07.714 --> 25:10.675
and then he walked me
over to the tree stump,

25:11.468 --> 25:14.012
sat me down, said, "Stay here."

25:14.596 --> 25:17.641
The tow truck belonged
to some kind of body shop,

25:18.308 --> 25:22.604
and they said that
if they didn't file a police report,

25:22.687 --> 25:24.856
that they would fix Lesline's car.

25:25.774 --> 25:29.194
[Lauren] All I knew was that it was
being fixed by the guys who hit it.

25:33.531 --> 25:35.700
[Kevin] Once I found out
where the car was at,

25:35.784 --> 25:38.495
I said to Ford that,

25:38.578 --> 25:40.828
"I don't think the place
is legit. I

25:40.833 --> 25:43.291
don't think it is what
you think it is."

25:45.210 --> 25:46.962
That, "You got to be very careful."

25:47.045 --> 25:50.632
That they weren't the kind of people
you wanted to play around with.

25:52.550 --> 25:54.886
[Barbara] I was on Rikers Island
at the time,

25:55.428 --> 25:58.974
and Lesline got a job
working for me.

25:59.516 --> 26:01.977
One day, we were driving home,

26:02.060 --> 26:04.271
and she asked me if I would stop by

26:04.354 --> 26:07.691
so she could see if her
car was finished.

26:07.774 --> 26:11.152
But it wasn't finished.

26:12.070 --> 26:14.781
And that's when the drama started.

26:23.248 --> 26:25.292
[Kevin] Sitting downstairs
on the sofa,

26:25.375 --> 26:28.211
and the phone rang, and it was Ford,
and he says,

26:28.295 --> 26:30.547
"Hey, what's going on? I
need a favor."

26:30.630 --> 26:35.010
So I said, "What's up?" And he goes,
"I need to go to pick up the car."

26:35.552 --> 26:37.387
It was late, I thought it was weird,

26:37.470 --> 26:41.349
but at that point I'd known the shop
to be open all types of hours of night.

26:41.433 --> 26:45.770
So I said, "Oh, great! Are you sure
you're picking up the car?"

26:45.854 --> 26:48.857
He's like, "Yeah, it's all done,"
and I'm like, "This is over.

26:48.940 --> 26:50.525
Let's get in the car. It's over."

26:50.608 --> 26:52.247
I got in the car, went the three

26:52.252 --> 26:54.612
blocks to get to
Ford's house.

26:55.238 --> 26:57.744
He came outside, seemed
in a good mood,

26:57.749 --> 26:59.617
so I didn't think
anything.

26:59.701 --> 27:01.077
He gets in the car.

27:01.745 --> 27:04.622
I remember turning the car
on and saying,

27:04.706 --> 27:06.207
"Let's go to Queens."

27:06.291 --> 27:08.835
"Queens" was our strip club's...

27:09.419 --> 27:10.920
code for going to a strip club.

27:11.004 --> 27:12.881
"Let's go to Queens, let's get a beer."

27:12.964 --> 27:15.550
He goes, "Yeah, sure.
Let me just go and get the car."

27:15.633 --> 27:17.010
I said OK.

27:17.093 --> 27:20.180
We got up the street
to the first stop sign,

27:20.263 --> 27:23.725
and again I said,
"I think we should go get a beer,"

27:23.808 --> 27:27.479
and he says, "Kev, you're bugging.
Take me to get the car."

27:27.562 --> 27:29.615
We turn, we start heading
down Ferndale

27:29.620 --> 27:31.107
towards Brightside,
and...

27:31.191 --> 27:33.735
once you make that turn
it's pretty much right there.

27:36.154 --> 27:37.919
I remember him going
into the yard and

27:37.924 --> 27:39.616
somebody coming out of
the shop door

27:39.699 --> 27:41.117
and meeting him in the yard.

27:41.201 --> 27:43.195
And immediately words
started getting

27:43.200 --> 27:45.330
exchanged. And I said,
"Oh, here we go."

27:45.413 --> 27:49.209
And it's nothing physical,
and it's nothing too out of control,

27:50.377 --> 27:52.796
so I'm just, like, not saying nothing.

27:53.338 --> 27:56.132
I'm just kind of standing there,
and then...

27:57.133 --> 28:00.595
someone walked out of the garage area.

28:03.807 --> 28:06.309
Three feet, four feet,
stopped dead in his tracks.

28:06.393 --> 28:08.353
Ford turned and said,

28:08.436 --> 28:11.314
"Kevin, that's the kid
that cursed out my mother."

28:12.565 --> 28:17.070
And then, back we grew up,
nobody disrespects your mom.

28:17.153 --> 28:20.740
At that point, I knew somebody
was going to get into a fight.

28:21.282 --> 28:24.911
There was nothing for me to say,
so I just said, "OK."

28:25.495 --> 28:28.415
And Ford went to walk towards him.

28:28.498 --> 28:30.458
The kid turned,

28:31.376 --> 28:33.294
went back in the garage
and made a left.

28:33.378 --> 28:34.712
Disappeared.

28:34.796 --> 28:37.715
The minute Ford walked into that
garage door and made a left,

28:37.799 --> 28:39.342
I heard a pop.

28:40.051 --> 28:43.054
And I said to the guy, I said,
"What the hell was that?"

28:43.138 --> 28:44.931
And he says, "I don't know."

28:45.014 --> 28:47.976
I said, "It sounded
like an air compressor,"

28:48.059 --> 28:50.228
and then I said,
"Do you guys have a gun here?"

28:50.311 --> 28:52.188
He said,
"Yeah, we have one in the back."

28:52.772 --> 28:54.274
I said, "Oh, shit."

28:57.026 --> 28:58.528
[Barbara] The phone rang.

29:01.156 --> 29:03.491
Kevin was on the phone.

29:04.701 --> 29:06.077
"Ms. Ford,

29:07.287 --> 29:10.290
you need to come to Super Stang."

29:12.959 --> 29:14.836
I said, "Why?"

29:14.919 --> 29:17.130
He said, "Something happened."

29:17.756 --> 29:19.758
She takes the car.

29:21.718 --> 29:25.889
And all I know is that
she pulled out of the driveway,

29:25.972 --> 29:28.933
heading down Cone Avenue.

29:38.735 --> 29:40.695
[Barbara] There was a barricade.

29:44.741 --> 29:47.911
No officer spoke to me.

29:50.497 --> 29:52.457
No officer...

29:53.917 --> 29:55.585
would look at me.

29:56.878 --> 29:59.464
Kevin came to me,

30:00.965 --> 30:03.384
and he said,

30:04.594 --> 30:07.555
"Mark Reilly shot William."

30:09.098 --> 30:12.060
And I said to the officer,

30:12.769 --> 30:14.103
you know...

30:15.563 --> 30:19.484
"Where is my son?
I want to be with my son."

30:22.237 --> 30:25.198
And he told me that...

30:28.034 --> 30:31.788
they had taken him to LIPA,

30:33.081 --> 30:35.166
to airlift him...

30:36.835 --> 30:38.294
to Stony Brook.

30:40.129 --> 30:42.549
We went to the emergency room.

30:43.591 --> 30:45.927
The area where he was,

30:46.553 --> 30:47.387
was...

30:48.555 --> 30:50.723
from here to that wall...

30:54.853 --> 30:58.731
with beds, you know,
where people were being treated.

31:07.448 --> 31:08.616
And...

31:14.873 --> 31:16.833
he was laying there.

31:22.046 --> 31:24.465
And he looked so peaceful.

31:30.346 --> 31:32.090
[Yance, reading] "The
body is that of

31:32.095 --> 31:33.725
a well-developed obese
black male.

31:34.267 --> 31:36.936
The body weighs 240 pounds,

31:37.020 --> 31:39.105
is five feet, eight
inches in height,

31:39.188 --> 31:42.859
and appears compatible
with the reported age of 24 years.

31:43.693 --> 31:46.779
Cause of death: gunshot
wound of chest.

31:46.863 --> 31:49.240
Manner of death: homicide."

31:52.702 --> 31:54.537
[Lauren] Eleven o'clock rolls by.

31:54.996 --> 31:59.417
Midnight comes by, and I haven't
heard anything from Mom.

32:00.209 --> 32:02.962
And Dad gets home. It's about
one o'clock in the morning.

32:03.046 --> 32:06.925
"What are you doing up? Where is
your mother? Where is William?"

32:07.008 --> 32:09.802
And I'm like, "He was in a fight
and Mom went to get him."

32:11.012 --> 32:13.097
I hear a car pull up outside.

32:14.724 --> 32:18.353
You know, Dad's looking at her,
I'm downstairs looking at her,

32:19.187 --> 32:22.190
and she comes in and she's like,
"He's gone."

32:24.776 --> 32:26.861
-[Yance] Is that how she said it?
-Yeah.

32:33.409 --> 32:35.703
Dad just held her,

32:37.705 --> 32:39.624
and held me, and...

32:41.501 --> 32:42.627
cried.

32:42.710 --> 32:44.379
We all just cried.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.174
You know?

32:50.802 --> 32:52.804
Dad sent me upstairs to my room.

32:54.764 --> 32:57.225
Whatever she explained,
she explained to Dad.

32:57.767 --> 32:59.560
She never explained it to me.

33:01.813 --> 33:04.899
[soft, sinister music]

33:07.694 --> 33:09.862
[Yance, reading]
"My boss asked me to call home.

33:10.613 --> 33:13.616
She was the Dean of Multicultural
Recruitment at Hamilton.

33:14.659 --> 33:16.327
I asked her what was wrong.

33:17.412 --> 33:18.955
She told me to stay calm.

33:19.789 --> 33:22.083
I told her not to tell
me to stay calm.

33:23.918 --> 33:25.545
My dad answered the phone.

33:25.628 --> 33:27.380
I said, 'Is it Mom?'

33:28.548 --> 33:30.466
He said, 'Your mother is fine.'

33:31.134 --> 33:34.345
I said, 'Lauren?'
Or maybe I said, 'What's happening?'

33:35.346 --> 33:37.473
He said, 'Your brother is gone.'

33:40.101 --> 33:42.562
The next part of the conversation
is a blur to me.

33:43.229 --> 33:45.273
I remember screaming
and punching the wall.

33:46.566 --> 33:48.276
Packing a few clothes,

33:48.359 --> 33:50.445
including the one dress I owned,

33:50.528 --> 33:51.571
and leaving.

33:54.240 --> 33:56.075
That was the beginning.

33:59.162 --> 34:00.747
I remember walking into the house

34:00.830 --> 34:03.791
and feeling immediately
like I was surrounded by strangers,

34:04.333 --> 34:07.628
even though they were people I
had known for most of my life.

34:08.670 --> 34:13.426
I remember walking in
and having to suppress the urge

34:14.010 --> 34:16.679
to tell everyone
to get the fuck out of the house.

34:18.764 --> 34:23.101
My mother was on the couch,
sleeping and crying.

34:24.437 --> 34:25.980
My father was...

34:28.858 --> 34:29.859
stunned.

34:31.110 --> 34:32.570
Imploding.

34:34.280 --> 34:35.656
My sister...

34:36.532 --> 34:37.867
was alone.

34:43.498 --> 34:49.003
And I felt like all the people
who were there were in the way,

34:49.587 --> 34:51.563
and were obstructing my
ability to see

34:51.569 --> 34:53.549
where the next threat
was coming from.

34:58.721 --> 35:01.099
If I could have turned
around and left,

35:03.601 --> 35:06.437
I would have, but that
wasn't an option."

35:07.730 --> 35:10.733
[soft, sinister music]

35:25.206 --> 35:28.876
[Barbara] We went to
meet with the DA.

35:29.418 --> 35:33.673
I'm not going to lie to you and say,

35:33.756 --> 35:37.468
"Well, the DA said this
and the detective said that."

35:38.219 --> 35:40.012
This is what I can tell you:

35:40.096 --> 35:42.014
from what they said,

35:42.849 --> 35:47.019
I did not feel that we were received

35:47.103 --> 35:51.190
as parents of a victim.

35:53.025 --> 35:56.779
OK? We weren't received
as parents of a victim.

35:57.321 --> 35:59.907
We were received as...

36:01.701 --> 36:07.665
folks being informed
that an investigation had to be conducted,

36:08.332 --> 36:10.209
and would be conducted.

36:10.293 --> 36:11.419
OK?

36:16.340 --> 36:17.592
I...

36:18.926 --> 36:22.263
was foolish enough to think

36:22.889 --> 36:25.558
that, well, you know,

36:25.641 --> 36:27.018
"It's gonna be OK."

36:28.436 --> 36:30.646
And then one day
I got a call to come...

36:32.023 --> 36:33.274
see Ms. Jones.

36:33.816 --> 36:36.319
We had no experience
with this kind of stuff.

36:36.402 --> 36:39.697
Maybe I should have had a lawyer.
I don't know what should have went on.

36:39.780 --> 36:41.532
She called and said "Meet me."

36:41.616 --> 36:45.870
You just go there, answer questions...
you know, about that night.

36:45.953 --> 36:47.038
That's what I thought.

36:47.121 --> 36:51.250
To be honest, I didn't know she was a DA.
I was thinking I was going to a detective.

36:51.334 --> 36:54.629
I was shocked
when she walked in the room.

36:55.504 --> 36:57.798
She really started
with the stuff with the gym.

36:57.882 --> 37:01.135
She was like, "You look
like you're in pretty good shape,"

37:01.219 --> 37:03.512
and, "How much do you weigh?"

37:04.055 --> 37:07.225
She asked something about William's size,

37:07.308 --> 37:11.145
kind of, more telling me than asking me,
and I don't think she sat down.

37:11.229 --> 37:14.273
She kept walking back and forth
in front of the table.

37:14.357 --> 37:15.524
It was just...

37:15.608 --> 37:16.692
I was like,

37:16.776 --> 37:21.656
"Why are they asking me all these
questions about strength and gym and..."

37:22.198 --> 37:25.034
It was not a lot about that night,

37:25.576 --> 37:26.994
or about...

37:29.121 --> 37:30.164
William.

37:33.084 --> 37:35.836
[Barbara] What they spent time on

37:36.545 --> 37:42.051
was investigating his background.

37:44.053 --> 37:46.055
That's what they spent time on.

37:48.683 --> 37:52.228
[Yance] Day by day, you hear
that your son is being investigated.

37:53.020 --> 37:54.772
Day by day, you hear rumors.

37:58.693 --> 38:00.736
And you grow more and more afraid.

38:01.821 --> 38:05.700
[soft, sinister music]

38:10.037 --> 38:12.290
[phone rings]

38:16.294 --> 38:18.879
[ringing continues]

38:21.048 --> 38:23.509
Countless number of times,

38:24.885 --> 38:26.846
at all hours of the night,

38:28.764 --> 38:31.225
during the summer
after my brother was killed,

38:31.809 --> 38:33.894
I could look outside the window,

38:33.978 --> 38:36.230
and there was a car
parked across the street.

38:37.231 --> 38:40.192
That car, and whoever was in that car

38:40.735 --> 38:44.530
was watching our house
and trying to intimidate my parents.

38:46.407 --> 38:49.327
The phone rang in the middle of the night,

38:49.410 --> 38:51.412
every night for months.

38:52.872 --> 38:57.418
When I was home, I unplugged
all of the phones in the house

38:57.501 --> 38:59.045
except for the one in my room,

38:59.587 --> 39:01.714
so my parents could
sleep through the night.

39:01.797 --> 39:05.718
So that they wouldn't have
to pick up the phone and say, "Hello?"

39:07.053 --> 39:09.680
and not have anyone respond.

39:10.222 --> 39:15.102
So they wouldn't have to hang up the phone
and go to the window,

39:15.186 --> 39:18.105
and see the car sitting across the street.

39:21.192 --> 39:23.569
[Yance] Having grown up
in the South,

39:23.652 --> 39:27.698
where the cops and the Klan
were one and the same,

39:27.782 --> 39:32.661
my parents didn't turn
to the police for protection.

39:33.621 --> 39:35.664
They had already felt
that the police

39:35.669 --> 39:37.124
had turned their own son

39:37.208 --> 39:39.752
into the prime suspect in
his own murder.

39:42.088 --> 39:43.837
So not only is the phone
ringing, not

39:43.842 --> 39:45.633
only is there a car
across the street,

39:45.716 --> 39:48.052
but there's the growing sense

39:48.677 --> 39:52.973
that the DA is going
to actually let this kid

39:53.057 --> 39:55.309
get away with murder.

40:00.564 --> 40:05.444
"May 20th, 1992.
District Attorney James Catterson.

40:06.320 --> 40:10.991
Dear Mr. Catterson,
I am the mother of William Ford Jr.

40:11.075 --> 40:14.203
a 24-year-old man
who was murdered by Mark Reilly.

40:15.704 --> 40:19.041
My family and I have been working
with Detective James Hughes

40:19.125 --> 40:21.252
and Assistant DA Stephen O'Brien

40:21.335 --> 40:23.462
regarding the investigation of this crime.

40:24.505 --> 40:28.592
We have waited and worked cooperatively
with the investigation.

40:29.218 --> 40:31.762
There is, however,
a nagging doubt which I have,

40:31.846 --> 40:34.056
regarding the prosecution of this crime.

40:35.433 --> 40:39.728
Now, nearly two months later
after his deliberate death,

40:39.812 --> 40:44.275
I and my family have yet to receive
even a note from the Reillys.

40:45.276 --> 40:47.111
Adding insult to injury,

40:47.194 --> 40:51.407
I now fear that your office has not yet
fully embraced the advocacy

40:51.490 --> 40:54.869
for the people of the State of New York
in the prosecution of this case.

40:55.744 --> 40:56.662
Why?

40:57.455 --> 41:02.877
It is because we are being told, quote,
'It is entirely up to the Grand Jury.'

41:04.086 --> 41:07.298
I believe that
the strength of the presentation

41:07.381 --> 41:11.635
made to the Grand Jury by your office
is the determining factor.

41:13.012 --> 41:17.099
My son was not armed,
not violent, not aggressing.

41:17.183 --> 41:20.603
In no way is his death justifiable.

41:21.687 --> 41:25.983
I intend never to rest
until his murderer is brought to justice.

41:27.151 --> 41:31.030
With the advocacy of your office
for the people of the State of New York,

41:31.113 --> 41:33.240
I trust that it will be soon,

41:33.324 --> 41:36.076
for we too, are the people.

41:37.036 --> 41:38.496
Barbara Dunmore-Ford."

41:42.708 --> 41:45.920
You know, the Grand Jury
is sort of this mystery, right, to people,

41:46.003 --> 41:48.297
And it's written
right into our Constitution.

41:48.380 --> 41:50.966
So really, it shouldn't be a mystery,
but it is.

41:51.050 --> 41:54.970
You know, the Bill of Rights calls
for a Grand Jury in felony cases,

41:55.054 --> 42:00.434
and that allows the prosecutor to present
its evidence to a neutral party,

42:00.518 --> 42:04.063
whether it's a Grand Jury
or a judge in a preliminary hearing,

42:04.146 --> 42:05.689
to show that there's two things:

42:05.773 --> 42:09.151
one, that there is probable cause
that a crime has been committed,

42:09.235 --> 42:13.072
and probable cause that this is
the individual who committed the crime.

42:19.161 --> 42:24.250
So at a trial, we have to prove beyond
reasonable doubt, to a moral certainty,

42:24.333 --> 42:27.670
that the person charged is
the defendant who committed the crime.

42:27.753 --> 42:30.339
But in the Grand Jury
it's just probable cause.

42:35.844 --> 42:39.974
In order for the case to go to a trial,
the Grand Jury would have had to...

42:40.057 --> 42:43.727
I mean, I wasn't there, but presumably
they would have voted a True Bill,

42:43.811 --> 42:46.355
saying that there was
probable cause to move forward.

42:54.488 --> 42:58.158
So a Grand Jury is somewhat mysterious,
I think, to the general public.

42:58.242 --> 43:01.203
Another reason that is,
is that it's secret.

43:02.162 --> 43:04.331
And, you know, that actually...

43:04.415 --> 43:08.043
I think some people
get concerned with that.

43:08.127 --> 43:11.046
It's actually supposed to be
a protection for the defendant.

43:11.130 --> 43:14.008
And the idea there is, you know,

43:14.091 --> 43:17.678
if the Grand Jury decides
that there is not probable cause,

43:17.761 --> 43:21.015
that the person should not have
the stigma of, you know,

43:21.098 --> 43:23.851
having been brought before a Grand Jury.

43:24.393 --> 43:25.728
And, you know,

43:25.811 --> 43:30.024
the disclosure of secret Grand Jury
material can be a crime in jurisdictions,

43:30.107 --> 43:34.028
and it's certainly unethical
for a prosecutor to disclose...

43:34.111 --> 43:35.946
things that happen in a Grand Jury.

43:36.030 --> 43:38.407
And the Grand Jurors themselves
can't disclose.

43:38.490 --> 43:40.367
Now, the witnesses, in New York,

43:40.451 --> 43:43.120
are free to talk about
what they presented to the Grand Jury.

43:44.705 --> 43:46.789
[Barbara] What flashed
into my mind just

43:46.794 --> 43:48.751
now, was the room we
were waiting in.

43:48.834 --> 43:51.211
The ADA came in,

43:51.295 --> 43:53.797
and called me in to testify.

43:55.341 --> 43:57.676
I walk in. I sit down.

43:58.677 --> 44:00.387
I look around the room.

44:00.929 --> 44:03.223
I see nobody who looks like me.

44:05.017 --> 44:06.894
No person of color.

44:13.942 --> 44:19.239
They were sitting in an area
like a theater.

44:19.865 --> 44:21.450
Elevated seats.

44:22.951 --> 44:25.913
There must have been
twenty-something people there.

44:27.748 --> 44:29.875
One person was reading a book,

44:29.958 --> 44:32.503
another lady was reading a magazine,

44:33.045 --> 44:35.673
there was a conversation going on...

44:36.590 --> 44:41.095
My feelings were,
when I sat in that chair...

44:43.555 --> 44:47.768
was, "They don't care
about what I have to say.

44:47.851 --> 44:49.186
They really don't."

44:49.937 --> 44:51.605
They weren't paying attention.

44:52.898 --> 44:54.191
They weren't.

44:54.817 --> 44:55.734
OK?

44:56.693 --> 44:57.736
And...

44:59.738 --> 45:03.826
I became very angry with myself,

45:04.785 --> 45:07.079
because at one point...

45:09.123 --> 45:10.999
I began to cry.

45:12.543 --> 45:14.420
And I...

45:15.546 --> 45:18.298
hated that moment.

45:19.675 --> 45:20.968
Because...

45:24.138 --> 45:25.848
I felt that...

45:27.724 --> 45:30.602
you know, they were going to say,

45:31.353 --> 45:34.690
"Here is another black woman

45:34.773 --> 45:38.193
who didn't do her job with her child,

45:38.277 --> 45:41.447
and now she wants us
to make somebody pay."

45:43.365 --> 45:44.533
That's how I felt.

45:45.951 --> 45:48.245
When your father came back,

45:48.787 --> 45:50.080
he said to me...

45:52.833 --> 45:55.085
"Don't expect anything,

45:55.169 --> 45:58.046
because it ain't gonna happen."

45:58.130 --> 46:01.383
-[Yance] And how did you find out?
-They came here.

46:01.467 --> 46:02.759
[Yance] Who came here?

46:04.511 --> 46:05.637
[sighs]

46:06.763 --> 46:08.432
One ADA,

46:09.516 --> 46:11.393
and a detective.

46:14.563 --> 46:16.190
[Yance] And what did they tell you?

46:17.774 --> 46:19.359
They didn't indict.

46:19.443 --> 46:21.361
They returned a No True Bill.

46:26.575 --> 46:27.868
[Yance] That was it?

46:29.119 --> 46:30.704
"I'm sorry."

46:34.458 --> 46:35.959
[Yance] What happened after that?

46:36.043 --> 46:38.587
I opened the door and said,
"Thank you for coming."

46:42.966 --> 46:45.219
And I will be very honest with you.

46:45.302 --> 46:47.513
When that door closed, I collapsed.

46:51.141 --> 46:53.602
[soft music]

47:19.211 --> 47:22.381
[Yance] I haven't ever, not once,

47:23.674 --> 47:25.759
tried to imagine what he looks like.

47:28.095 --> 47:29.721
I think he looks like...

47:34.184 --> 47:36.270
no offense to present company,

47:36.895 --> 47:38.730
every white man I've ever seen.

47:43.402 --> 47:46.905
I think he looks like...
the ticket taker...

47:47.990 --> 47:49.199
on the Long Island Railroad.

47:49.283 --> 47:51.660
I think he looks like, you know...

47:53.996 --> 47:57.374
the guy in front of me, buying a beer,

47:58.250 --> 47:59.501
at the bar.

48:02.462 --> 48:04.464
I think he looks like, you know...

48:07.718 --> 48:09.678
the schmuck who took my cab.

48:11.179 --> 48:13.056
He looks like my physical therapist.

48:16.977 --> 48:19.146
He looks like, you know...

48:21.356 --> 48:23.692
anybody, anyone, everyone.

48:25.110 --> 48:26.403
He's everywhere.

48:30.115 --> 48:31.617
He looks like everywhere.

48:40.125 --> 48:42.002
It's one of those things
you do in high school.

48:42.085 --> 48:43.295
Everybody just....

48:44.212 --> 48:45.047
proves themselves.

48:45.130 --> 48:48.634
And... Ford proved himself
on a daily basis!

48:48.717 --> 48:50.052
[Kevin laughs]

48:50.135 --> 48:53.639
He just took on this personality,
I guess, once he realized his size,

48:53.722 --> 48:57.351
and that he could... you know,
that he could intimidate people.

48:57.934 --> 49:01.063
It was actually my birthday,
I think it was my 16th birthday,

49:01.146 --> 49:03.852
and one of the more menacing
kids decided

49:03.857 --> 49:06.401
that day was my turn to
get picked on.

49:06.485 --> 49:10.280
We were in a fight,
and one of his friends had a knife,

49:10.364 --> 49:15.035
and tried to give the knife
to the person I was engaged with.

49:15.911 --> 49:18.747
Ford just stopped him, and he goes,

49:19.498 --> 49:21.249
"I wouldn't do that if I was you."

49:21.333 --> 49:24.294
He just grabbed the knife and the
kid just kind of looked at him,

49:24.378 --> 49:27.172
and went back to watching the fight.

49:27.255 --> 49:29.299
You know, I don't know
if he saved my life.

49:29.383 --> 49:31.134
It was just, Ford was very protective.

49:34.763 --> 49:37.099
[Kevin] Ford got his license
in the 11th grade.

49:37.683 --> 49:41.978
Your family had an extremely large,
green station wagon.

49:44.064 --> 49:45.953
I think it probably fit,
like, 15 people

49:45.958 --> 49:47.693
in it, and we made sure
that it did.

49:47.776 --> 49:51.071
And we would travel to
different towns,

49:51.154 --> 49:54.157
looking for trouble and
looking for girls.

49:54.241 --> 49:57.160
Ninety-nine percent trouble
and one percent girls!

49:57.244 --> 49:58.662
[JVC Force: "Strong Island"]

49:58.745 --> 50:03.166
Living in CI, who the hell am I?
AJ Rok the juice, I get fly

50:03.250 --> 50:05.502
Cool with the riffing
Guy, keep a handle

50:05.585 --> 50:08.338
 Cause if you don't
I'll wax you down like a candle

50:08.422 --> 50:10.632
 Kill it or shoot it
Buy it or distribute it

50:10.716 --> 50:12.676
But either way the two's
unconstituted

50:12.759 --> 50:15.804
Styling and wilding
Constantly smiling

50:15.887 --> 50:18.640
We'll keep trooping
In a place called Strong Island

50:19.474 --> 50:22.561
So the first time I met him was in '85,

50:22.644 --> 50:25.564
our freshman year at Howard University
in Washington DC.

50:26.398 --> 50:31.027
And Ford was the only one
that had on a shirt and tie,

50:31.570 --> 50:35.657
slacks, and some...
you know, a pair of dress shoes!

50:35.741 --> 50:38.243
Everybody else was
in sneakers and shorts.

50:38.326 --> 50:40.829
And it was strange,

50:40.912 --> 50:43.957
because the first thought
you would think is,

50:44.666 --> 50:46.084
"Is he a nerd?"

50:46.168 --> 50:48.670
You know, was he a square, or...

50:48.754 --> 50:52.174
But he actually wasn't any of that.

50:52.257 --> 50:53.967
You know, he was just...

50:56.803 --> 50:59.598
He liked to make
a good impression, you know?

51:00.807 --> 51:03.018
The second semester
was the hardest for him.

51:06.188 --> 51:08.857
He didn't love Howard, you know.

51:10.233 --> 51:14.279
He wanted to be home, you know.
He wanted to be home. Yeah.

51:22.204 --> 51:25.040
[Yance, reading] "January
30th, 1989.

51:26.291 --> 51:28.919
I'm trying to keep
all aspects of my life balanced

51:29.002 --> 51:31.213
and be successful in all of them.

51:31.296 --> 51:33.757
I cut school today to go get a job.

51:33.840 --> 51:38.470
I got a Sunday-to-Thursday
three-to-11 shift, driving a cab.

51:39.054 --> 51:42.474
I need the money for Valentine's Day
and Mom's birthday,

51:42.557 --> 51:44.810
and my other job doesn't start
until the 15th."

51:47.938 --> 51:48.939
Untitled.

51:50.315 --> 51:52.567
"Looking at her is peace itself.

51:53.401 --> 51:55.654
He is at last where he
has longed to be.

51:56.196 --> 51:58.281
Finally, a loving place
in her heart.

51:59.825 --> 52:01.827
He looks upon her
and now begins to wonder

52:01.910 --> 52:04.412
if the love of someone so radiant
can be possessed.

52:06.414 --> 52:08.458
He likes holding her in his arms,

52:08.542 --> 52:12.462
close to him, breathing together
as if from one heart.

52:14.089 --> 52:16.151
He loves her gentle kisses
under his neck

52:16.156 --> 52:17.884
that make him powerless
to stand.

52:19.845 --> 52:22.597
Does she know that she is
the ghost that haunts his dreams?

52:23.598 --> 52:26.059
Dream, and dream.

52:27.060 --> 52:28.687
He begins to wonder.

52:29.271 --> 52:32.232
He looks at her
because he doesn't want to lose

52:32.315 --> 52:34.609
what he is not certain he truly has.

52:35.902 --> 52:37.195
He will always look.

52:38.947 --> 52:40.198
Anything she wants.

52:41.074 --> 52:42.576
William Ford, Jr."

52:44.119 --> 52:46.705
Some of the stuff,
I couldn't wrap my mind around.

52:46.788 --> 52:49.875
I said, "Bread, man,
what are you writing about, man?"

52:50.792 --> 52:53.253
But in retrospect,

52:53.336 --> 52:56.256
it could have just been life,
man, you know.

52:57.591 --> 53:00.093
[Yance] William needed a job
to get him back on his feet,

53:00.176 --> 53:02.257
and my mother helped him
get a position

53:02.262 --> 53:03.680
as an assistant teacher.

53:04.723 --> 53:07.309
He was assigned to the boys' school
on Rikers Island

53:07.392 --> 53:10.186
and helped teach math to the
young men who were jailed there.

53:12.105 --> 53:14.859
[Harvey] When Cornbread
started teaching

53:14.864 --> 53:17.736
at Rikers, I think his
innocence was lost.

53:19.195 --> 53:21.239
The tragedy...

53:24.784 --> 53:27.829
to see others...

53:30.206 --> 53:33.668
that... that look like you, are you...

53:36.004 --> 53:37.380
still in bondage.

53:38.506 --> 53:42.969
To try to wrap your mind
around what needs to be done,

53:43.762 --> 53:45.180
at a young age,

53:45.263 --> 53:47.724
realizing there's no quick fix,

53:47.807 --> 53:50.602
and this was...
it was like a culture shock.

53:53.063 --> 53:57.025
I think the... his experience at Rikers

53:57.859 --> 54:00.362
deepened him, you know?

54:03.323 --> 54:05.033
It deepened him,

54:05.116 --> 54:06.910
to the point that...

54:10.789 --> 54:13.249
he wanted to... to make...

54:16.920 --> 54:21.049
make his... efforts count for something.

54:22.092 --> 54:23.259
Yeah.

54:30.183 --> 54:33.436
[Kevin] William walked towards the
garage and made a left.

54:35.063 --> 54:37.691
It wasn't maybe two seconds,
three seconds...

54:37.774 --> 54:39.526
I just heard, like, a pop.

54:41.194 --> 54:43.321
By the time I got to the garage door,

54:43.405 --> 54:45.782
William was backpedaling,

54:45.865 --> 54:49.244
and he just kind of spun,
I mean, with the biggest eyeballs,

54:49.327 --> 54:52.580
and he just looked at me and he goes,
"Kev, he shot me."

54:53.832 --> 54:57.502
And... I wasn't strong enough
to hold him up.

54:57.585 --> 54:59.462
We both kind of fell to the ground.

54:59.546 --> 55:02.757
You know, once I asked the guy,
he was named Tom,

55:02.841 --> 55:04.426
"What kind of gun is it?"

55:04.509 --> 55:07.887
And he goes,
"Oh, it's a twenty-two. It's a rifle."

55:07.971 --> 55:09.597
So I kind of chuckled and I...

55:09.681 --> 55:13.018
you know, it's kind of something you use
to hunt rabbits or birds, you know?

55:13.560 --> 55:16.229
I remember laughing,
and I'm holding Ford, and going,

55:16.312 --> 55:18.064
"Dude you got shot with a .22!

55:18.148 --> 55:20.650
This is hilarious!
Are you kidding me? Get up!"

55:21.568 --> 55:22.944
And,

55:23.611 --> 55:24.821
Ford wasn't saying nothing.

55:24.904 --> 55:26.614
I'm like, "Dude, get up."

55:26.698 --> 55:28.199
And...

55:29.826 --> 55:32.245
Then I saw some kind of...

55:33.121 --> 55:36.291
fluid, you know, on the pavement,

55:36.374 --> 55:38.251
and I'm just, like, "What is that?"

55:38.334 --> 55:39.377
And...

55:40.795 --> 55:43.089
you know, it was never...

55:43.173 --> 55:44.758
I never saw any blood.

55:45.300 --> 55:48.887
I just remember things happening very fast
at that point.

55:48.970 --> 55:52.557
The police came
and they're, like, grabbing me,

55:52.640 --> 55:56.978
and pulling me to get away from Ford,
and I'm like, "You can't leave him there!"

55:57.062 --> 56:01.191
And they're like, "There's a person
with a gun inside, get behind the car."

56:01.274 --> 56:04.110
They put me behind the police car
and they left Ford there.

56:04.194 --> 56:05.945
I'm like, "You can't leave him here."

56:06.029 --> 56:09.657
And, one police officer was like,
"You better not move."

56:10.200 --> 56:12.410
And the next thing I know,

56:12.494 --> 56:16.081
they were walking out
with the guy that, you know, shot him.

56:16.623 --> 56:21.419
And he never went in handcuffs,
and that was kind of odd to me.

56:21.503 --> 56:25.590
I don't remember them putting him in a
police car. They put him against the car.

56:25.673 --> 56:27.967
And there was a conversation that ensued.

56:28.051 --> 56:32.388
That's the part that was just weird to me.
I kept paying attention to that part.

56:33.098 --> 56:35.225
At some point, a limousine pulled up,

56:35.767 --> 56:38.394
and I remember them walking this kid
to the limousine.

56:38.478 --> 56:43.399
And I just stood there, like,
"This is crazy that he's not in handcuffs,

56:43.483 --> 56:45.485
that he's going to get into a limo."

56:47.445 --> 56:49.823
He was in there for some period of time.

56:50.907 --> 56:54.244
I kept asking, I said,
"Where's the ambulance? What's going on?

56:54.327 --> 56:57.497
I've got to go see Ford.
I've got to go see my friend."

56:57.580 --> 57:01.626
And this cop is like, "You're not going
anywhere, you're coming to the precinct.

57:01.709 --> 57:03.461
You have a lot of questions to answer.

57:03.545 --> 57:07.507
You have to understand that a man
has been murdered here tonight."

57:07.590 --> 57:12.262
It's how I found out that Ford
had already, I guess, passed away.

57:13.263 --> 57:16.850
And I remember standing there,
and I'm like, "What?

57:16.933 --> 57:19.102
What do you mean? He's dead?"

57:20.019 --> 57:22.564
From the time that William was shot

57:22.647 --> 57:24.274
and that limo pulled up,

57:24.357 --> 57:25.942
the story got made then.

57:26.943 --> 57:28.111
You know,

57:28.194 --> 57:31.573
that this person...

57:32.449 --> 57:35.785
was not going to jail, period.

57:36.703 --> 57:37.871
You know.

57:38.913 --> 57:40.540
It just wasn't going to happen.

57:49.507 --> 57:51.676
[Yance] So after William was killed,
I was...

57:52.218 --> 57:54.637
I tried to have
eyes in the back of my head.

57:57.515 --> 57:59.392
Am I saying what I really mean?

58:03.396 --> 58:06.065
I remember coming here and I remember...

58:08.776 --> 58:10.612
you know, kind of...

58:13.031 --> 58:15.700
you know, kind of coming inside
and seeing you guys.

58:18.578 --> 58:20.663
And your mom was sitting on the couch,

58:21.664 --> 58:23.708
and I was kind of scared to approach her.

58:24.626 --> 58:27.212
And she was, like...
She's like, "Come here."

58:27.295 --> 58:30.798
And I kind of walked over
and she said, "Sit on my lap."

58:30.882 --> 58:34.844
And she said, "Kevin, just two things."

58:34.928 --> 58:37.430
She goes, "Don't desert me,"

58:38.097 --> 58:39.098
and she goes,

58:39.182 --> 58:42.810
"This is what Ford would have wanted.
He would have wanted you to be there."

58:47.148 --> 58:48.900
That was just...

58:53.905 --> 58:56.449
It took the air out of me, you know?

58:59.118 --> 59:02.080
It left me constantly winded, man.

59:04.040 --> 59:05.333
You know.

59:06.918 --> 59:08.378
You know...

59:13.508 --> 59:16.803
I decided not to let anybody see me upset.

59:17.554 --> 59:20.515
Because then they would want
to talk about it.

59:20.598 --> 59:24.394
And I don't want to talk about it.
Back then, I didn't want to talk about it.

59:25.603 --> 59:30.191
So whenever anybody asked me
how I was doing, I said I was doing fine.

59:31.693 --> 59:34.195
I started spending some time...

59:36.030 --> 59:40.493
away from home,
because I couldn't be here by myself.

59:41.995 --> 59:44.664
Or, you know, with Mom and Dad.

59:45.206 --> 59:48.167
Mom just spontaneously crying, and...

59:48.626 --> 59:53.131
If I wasn't with my friends after school,

59:53.673 --> 59:56.259
I was here, either in my room,

59:56.843 --> 59:58.344
or watching TV.

59:59.512 --> 01:00:01.973
And just... just staying quiet.

01:00:07.228 --> 01:00:09.731
[Yance] After William was killed,
I was scared.

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:14.277
I was scared to leave my home,

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.945
I was scared to stay.

01:00:20.575 --> 01:00:23.036
I was scared that my parents would...

01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:36.758
Your father said to me,

01:00:39.052 --> 01:00:41.721
"Don't do anything to hurt my daughters.

01:00:45.058 --> 01:00:48.686
Don't do anything to hurt my girls.

01:00:49.354 --> 01:00:51.397
These are vicious people.

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:56.194
Your son was shot down like a dog.

01:00:58.112 --> 01:01:00.448
You're not going to be with them always,

01:01:00.531 --> 01:01:02.200
I'm not with them always.

01:01:02.867 --> 01:01:04.702
The girls are all we have left."

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:09.791
[soft, sinister music]

01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:18.257
[Barbara] I wanted him to be angry.

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:21.552
I wanted him to be outraged.

01:01:23.721 --> 01:01:25.598
I wanted him...

01:01:26.641 --> 01:01:28.017
to...

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:31.604
I wanted him to get a gun...

01:01:34.399 --> 01:01:38.027
to avenge my son's death.

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:44.909
He became silent.

01:01:55.128 --> 01:01:58.673
We never sat down as a family
and talked about what happened.

01:02:03.761 --> 01:02:05.430
We just kind of...

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:12.228
went into our own spaces,
went into our own heads.

01:02:19.819 --> 01:02:22.238
[Barbara] The house had a stillness

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:26.409
unlike anything I've ever felt

01:02:27.535 --> 01:02:28.995
in my life.

01:02:33.499 --> 01:02:35.209
It was like...

01:02:36.669 --> 01:02:38.713
all the sound...

01:02:39.672 --> 01:02:41.048
left the world.

01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:50.141
I thought...

01:02:51.058 --> 01:02:54.270
that I could comfort your father,

01:02:55.855 --> 01:02:58.983
or... and that he would comfort me.

01:03:01.986 --> 01:03:04.030
But he turned his back.

01:03:08.367 --> 01:03:11.287
I would move over, over...

01:03:12.121 --> 01:03:15.374
and... he couldn't go any further.

01:03:16.125 --> 01:03:17.835
He couldn't go any further.

01:03:20.213 --> 01:03:23.758
So I got up and I walked
around the bed,

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.219
and I got in front of him.

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:29.931
I just said,

01:03:32.183 --> 01:03:34.435
"It's not your loss.

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:38.064
It's our loss.

01:03:41.108 --> 01:03:44.529
We, together, created this child.

01:03:45.363 --> 01:03:48.991
God granted him to us for these years.

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:57.291
You can't grieve an issue
that came from my body,

01:03:57.375 --> 01:03:58.960
and shut me out."

01:04:03.297 --> 01:04:04.841
And we both cried.

01:04:05.383 --> 01:04:08.719
He embraced me, and we both cried.

01:04:08.803 --> 01:04:10.930
And that's how we went to sleep.

01:04:19.105 --> 01:04:22.900
[soft wind blows]

01:04:32.493 --> 01:04:34.537
[chattering crowd]

01:04:36.622 --> 01:04:38.082
Yance, go down.

01:04:38.666 --> 01:04:41.377
Why don't you let us button up your strap?

01:04:42.086 --> 01:04:42.962
No.

01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:44.859
[Yance] My father had
the stroke that

01:04:44.864 --> 01:04:46.883
paralyzed him on the left
side of his body

01:04:46.966 --> 01:04:49.093
the year after my brother
was killed.

01:04:52.638 --> 01:04:54.473
Help me stand up.

01:04:54.557 --> 01:04:56.058
Help you stand up?

01:04:57.602 --> 01:04:58.811
Yeah.

01:05:04.483 --> 01:05:06.402
Right. OK.

01:05:07.194 --> 01:05:08.654
[Lauren] Yance, stand next to Dad.

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:10.406
-Do you want to stand beside me?
-Yeah.

01:05:10.489 --> 01:05:12.491
-Where are you?
-I'm right here.

01:05:13.868 --> 01:05:15.786
That's the good side.

01:05:16.621 --> 01:05:19.040
The right side is the good side.

01:05:19.123 --> 01:05:21.834
-I know.
-Alright. OK.

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:23.210
[Lauren] Smile, Dad.

01:05:23.294 --> 01:05:24.587
[he chuckles]

01:05:26.088 --> 01:05:27.632
What else?

01:05:28.215 --> 01:05:30.468
[Lauren] OK, this is good. I'm done.

01:05:32.553 --> 01:05:34.513
And... fading to black.

01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:36.432
[woman laughs]

01:05:37.683 --> 01:05:40.686
When I went to college,
I did start doing what I wanted to do.

01:05:41.228 --> 01:05:46.025
I had filled out an application
for the Rochester Police Department...

01:05:47.234 --> 01:05:48.444
you know?

01:05:49.195 --> 01:05:51.948
And I was looking into
the Monroe Sheriff's County...

01:05:53.199 --> 01:05:55.451
the Monroe County Sheriff's Department.

01:05:55.993 --> 01:05:59.080
I wanted to... I was pursuing...

01:05:59.872 --> 01:06:03.376
you know, being a cop
or being an EMT up there,

01:06:03.918 --> 01:06:05.336
when Dad had his stroke,

01:06:05.419 --> 01:06:06.379
and...

01:06:07.505 --> 01:06:09.674
Mom was like, "We can't
afford to keep you up there."

01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:19.934
[Lauren] 7:30 in the morning.
I had woken up late.

01:06:20.017 --> 01:06:22.728
I got dressed, got my
stuff together...

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:27.900
I had to go to class,
because we had a test.

01:06:32.613 --> 01:06:34.907
I go into the city. I do my thing.

01:06:35.282 --> 01:06:36.409
I come back home,

01:06:38.077 --> 01:06:41.247
but the first thing I see
is Dad's wheelchair folded up

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:45.042
in the corner of the foyer,
and I'm like, "What's going on?"

01:06:47.878 --> 01:06:50.923
Mom found him outside,

01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:54.552
underneath the porch in a
nice shady spot,

01:06:54.635 --> 01:06:57.596
where he liked to sit
and watch people go by.

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:01.058
[gentle ambient music]

01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:40.347
[Barbara] I did William a
great disservice

01:07:41.849 --> 01:07:45.436
in raising him the way we did.

01:07:46.687 --> 01:07:48.439
Because,

01:07:48.522 --> 01:07:52.359
we've always tried to teach you guys

01:07:52.443 --> 01:07:56.489
that you see character
and not color.

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:03.746
And many, many times, I wonder...

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:09.460
how I could be so wrong.

01:08:31.564 --> 01:08:34.443
[Yance] The only nightmare
I ever remember having

01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:39.406
is my mother,
standing at the top of the stairway

01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:41.200
in her nightgown.

01:08:42.201 --> 01:08:44.078
Her hair is on end.

01:08:44.745 --> 01:08:46.372
There's light behind her.

01:08:47.413 --> 01:08:49.125
I can't see her face.

01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:52.211
She says to me,

01:08:53.504 --> 01:08:55.548
"This house is made of bone.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:00.010
This house is made of bone.

01:09:02.263 --> 01:09:04.849
This house is made of bone."

01:09:12.814 --> 01:09:15.276
[buzzing]

01:09:28.997 --> 01:09:30.707
[Barbara] I failed

01:09:31.292 --> 01:09:34.712
to keep my son alive.

01:09:37.673 --> 01:09:41.010
I failed you and your sister,

01:09:41.676 --> 01:09:45.764
in not pursuing justice.

01:09:49.393 --> 01:09:51.478
How do you know...

01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:55.149
when and what to do differently?

01:09:56.775 --> 01:09:59.236
[Yance] OK, my dear.

01:10:00.112 --> 01:10:01.906
[Barbara] Thank you very much.

01:10:02.489 --> 01:10:04.867
[Yance] Want to go up to the mirror
to take a look?

01:10:13.334 --> 01:10:16.420
My mother always suspected
that there was something else,

01:10:16.962 --> 01:10:19.882
that she didn't know,
or that she hadn't been told,

01:10:19.965 --> 01:10:23.719
that had happened, that had
contributed to my brother's death.

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:26.347
She had asked me,

01:10:26.889 --> 01:10:29.350
"Is there anything that you know
that I don't know?"

01:10:29.892 --> 01:10:33.979
And I flat out lied to her
on more than one occasion,

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:34.980
and said, "No.

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:37.650
You know everything I know."

01:10:39.985 --> 01:10:41.528
[Yance] And that wasn't true.

01:10:45.491 --> 01:10:47.547
I never told my mom about
the conversation

01:10:47.552 --> 01:10:48.911
that William had with me.

01:10:48.994 --> 01:10:51.121
I never told my mother
that he called.

01:10:53.999 --> 01:10:55.914
I went to college 300
miles from home,

01:10:55.919 --> 01:10:57.670
in the middle of upstate
New York.

01:10:58.837 --> 01:11:01.757
When I got to Hamilton,
I could finally come out.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.843
I just didn't have to hide anymore.

01:11:05.469 --> 01:11:07.888
And that's the person
that William didn't know.

01:11:11.684 --> 01:11:15.145
When William had a confrontation...

01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:19.108
Not the night that he was shot
but about a month earlier,

01:11:20.526 --> 01:11:22.194
at the garage,

01:11:22.987 --> 01:11:28.158
and threw a vacuum cleaner
and picked up a... a car door...

01:11:30.703 --> 01:11:32.454
threatening to slam it down...

01:11:34.623 --> 01:11:36.000
He called me after that,

01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:40.212
and told me what he had done, and...

01:11:41.463 --> 01:11:43.924
I was proud of him.

01:11:44.675 --> 01:11:48.053
I cheered him on, for being a bad-ass,

01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:50.431
for not taking shit from anybody.

01:11:50.514 --> 01:11:52.182
And he actually called me.

01:11:54.268 --> 01:11:56.353
He could have called his friends.

01:11:57.354 --> 01:11:59.648
He could have chosen not to call anyone.

01:11:59.732 --> 01:12:02.735
But he called me, and told me about it.

01:12:02.818 --> 01:12:04.987
Because he was proud of himself.

01:12:05.821 --> 01:12:08.157
And I think that he wanted me
to be proud of him.

01:12:08.741 --> 01:12:09.992
And I was.

01:12:12.286 --> 01:12:14.246
And I felt a little bit like...

01:12:16.206 --> 01:12:20.085
even though he might not have fully known
who he was talking to...

01:12:22.421 --> 01:12:25.549
it felt like he was talking
to the real me.

01:12:29.053 --> 01:12:31.138
And that's why that phone call is so dear.

01:12:32.848 --> 01:12:34.558
That's why it's so important.

01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:38.354
And that's why I feel like I fucked it up.

01:12:41.690 --> 01:12:44.026
[Yance] Mark Reilly is accountable
for William's death

01:12:44.109 --> 01:12:45.986
because Mark Reilly shot William.

01:12:47.613 --> 01:12:51.617
But I could have helped William stay
out of that situation to begin with.

01:12:52.826 --> 01:12:56.205
If I had told my parents
about the first incident,

01:12:56.288 --> 01:12:59.625
he would have been stopped
in his tracks,

01:12:59.708 --> 01:13:01.710
because they both would have
come down on him.

01:13:02.711 --> 01:13:04.129
But instead,

01:13:04.671 --> 01:13:06.340
I enjoyed...

01:13:07.383 --> 01:13:09.176
my brother, the hero.

01:13:10.844 --> 01:13:14.139
And a month later or so,

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:15.766
that hero was dead.

01:13:17.726 --> 01:13:20.646
The madness that is my brother's death,

01:13:21.271 --> 01:13:23.232
would drive me mad,

01:13:24.358 --> 01:13:26.402
if I weren't able...

01:13:28.487 --> 01:13:31.657
to hold myself accountable
for at least a small part of it.

01:13:32.783 --> 01:13:35.869
Because then, it sort of...
it grounds it somewhere.

01:13:35.953 --> 01:13:37.621
It puts it on the earth,

01:13:38.664 --> 01:13:42.918
as opposed to in the ether,
or as opposed to... in the unknown,

01:13:43.001 --> 01:13:44.795
or in the anonymous.

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:50.175
If I don't ground it,
in some way, in myself,

01:13:50.717 --> 01:13:53.011
then it's everywhere, all the time.

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:54.555
It's ubiquitous.

01:13:57.933 --> 01:14:02.020
And that actually is a greater,
more damaging,

01:14:02.563 --> 01:14:04.690
heavier burden to live with,

01:14:05.315 --> 01:14:09.945
than to blame myself
for not being a smarter 19-year-old,

01:14:10.028 --> 01:14:12.448
when my brother called me and told me

01:14:13.073 --> 01:14:15.492
about this stupid fight that he had.

01:14:20.873 --> 01:14:22.374
Does that make sense?

01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:31.341
[train horn blaring]

01:14:50.027 --> 01:14:52.821
[car passes outside]

01:14:55.741 --> 01:14:58.869
[phone dialing]

01:15:00.621 --> 01:15:03.415
[ringing]

01:15:08.378 --> 01:15:10.047
[man] Detective's Association.

01:15:10.130 --> 01:15:13.634
Good morning. I was hoping to speak
to Detective James Hughes, please.

01:15:13.717 --> 01:15:15.594
This is Detective James Hughes.

01:15:15.677 --> 01:15:18.680
Good morning, Detective Hughes.
My name is Yance Ford.

01:15:19.223 --> 01:15:21.475
I don't know if my name
is familiar to you at all.

01:15:21.558 --> 01:15:23.661
It's familiar because I
just got back from

01:15:23.666 --> 01:15:25.604
vacation and listened
to your message.

01:15:25.687 --> 01:15:27.790
I do remember the case.
I remembered it

01:15:27.795 --> 01:15:29.900
as soon as I heard your
brother's name.

01:15:30.442 --> 01:15:34.279
You know, obviously, the Grand Jury,
when presented with the evidence,

01:15:34.363 --> 01:15:36.406
came back with a No True
Bill on the case.

01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:38.283
You know, there was a...

01:15:40.494 --> 01:15:45.749
The Grand Jury pretty much looked at
the case as... a self-defense case.

01:15:45.832 --> 01:15:48.794
They felt it was a justifiable...
shooting.

01:15:49.753 --> 01:15:53.382
The way the Grand Jury went was
supported by the facts and evidence.

01:15:54.091 --> 01:15:58.595
Just, you know, I mean... and that's
part of what made the case so hard.

01:15:59.972 --> 01:16:02.015
But, I mean, this wasn't a thing

01:16:02.099 --> 01:16:04.476
where I thought the Grand Jury
went the wrong way.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:07.771
Because I had a number
of different statements from people,

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:10.566
about incidents prior to
this incident.

01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:12.234
And...

01:16:12.317 --> 01:16:15.696
[Yance] I mean, I know that
there was one incident before...

01:16:15.779 --> 01:16:17.322
the night that he was killed,

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:19.491
because he told me about it.

01:16:19.575 --> 01:16:23.453
You know, he'd picked up a car door.
He'd thrown a vacuum cleaner.

01:16:23.537 --> 01:16:24.496
[James] Oh, yeah.

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:27.374
So I know that that incident occurred.
I don't know...

01:16:27.457 --> 01:16:30.002
Let me see if I can get a hold
of any of my reports.

01:16:30.085 --> 01:16:33.630
OK. Anything... Anything you could
share with me would be really helpful.

01:16:33.714 --> 01:16:36.300
-I can't promise. But if I can...
-No, of course not.

01:16:36.383 --> 01:16:38.552
I really appreciate it.
Thank you very much.

01:16:38.635 --> 01:16:42.139
-I'll talk to you within the next
week. -OK, sounds good. Thank you.

01:16:44.391 --> 01:16:45.892
[exhales]

01:17:00.949 --> 01:17:03.952
[dialing on phone]

01:17:09.916 --> 01:17:12.461
[ringing tone]

01:17:19.468 --> 01:17:21.428
-[woman] Hey, there.
-[Yance] Hey.

01:17:21.511 --> 01:17:22.638
[woman] How's it going?

01:17:23.013 --> 01:17:25.807
I just talked to Detective Hughes.

01:17:26.433 --> 01:17:28.060
Oh, my goodness.

01:17:28.769 --> 01:17:31.688
I need to talk. I just need to hear
your voice for a few minutes.

01:17:31.772 --> 01:17:33.815
I'm right here. I'm right here.

01:17:33.899 --> 01:17:36.068
The fucking vacuum cleaner...

01:17:36.818 --> 01:17:37.903
incident...

01:17:37.986 --> 01:17:39.404
Oh, my God.

01:17:40.197 --> 01:17:42.366
...is why they didn't indict him.

01:17:44.534 --> 01:17:45.744
[woman gasps] What?

01:17:47.537 --> 01:17:51.041
Because he threw a vacuum cleaner.
Because he picked up a car door.

01:17:51.124 --> 01:17:55.629
And because apparently that's enough
to justify reasonable fear.

01:17:55.712 --> 01:17:57.756
What kind of investigation was this?

01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:04.262
The fucking vacuum cleaner.
Oh, my gosh, my love.

01:18:04.930 --> 01:18:06.306
OK.

01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:08.225
Wait. What else did he say?

01:18:08.308 --> 01:18:10.644
Nothing. I just hung up
the phone with him.

01:18:10.727 --> 01:18:12.437
He's going to call me back next week.

01:18:12.521 --> 01:18:14.856
-He's gonna call you back next week.
OK. -Yeah.

01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:16.983
Did you start crying on the phone
or after?

01:18:17.609 --> 01:18:20.153
After. I managed to keep myself together!

01:18:21.238 --> 01:18:23.532
Deep breath. Take a deep breath.

01:18:24.074 --> 01:18:25.075
Thank you.

01:18:25.158 --> 01:18:28.036
-I'll be home soon, OK?
-OK. Talk to you soon. Bye.

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:33.250
[inhales deep breath]

01:18:40.090 --> 01:18:41.800
[Yance sobs quietly]

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:44.803
[high-pitched whining noise]

01:18:51.852 --> 01:18:55.147
[screams]

01:19:01.486 --> 01:19:04.489
[breathes deeply]

01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:17.544
[high-pitched whining noise]

01:19:24.676 --> 01:19:27.971
[noise fades to crickets chirping]

01:19:29.556 --> 01:19:32.601
You know, I actually had hoped
to not be in New York that weekend.

01:19:32.684 --> 01:19:36.188
I had hoped to be in Chicago
with a bunch of my friends.

01:19:36.271 --> 01:19:39.608
But I couldn't get anyone to cover
my shifts at the DA's office.

01:19:40.317 --> 01:19:43.987
I didn't have any cash
so I went to the local ATM,

01:19:44.946 --> 01:19:46.948
and as I was doing the transaction,

01:19:47.032 --> 01:19:49.075
I felt something at the back of my head.

01:19:49.159 --> 01:19:52.162
And at first I actually thought it was
one of my roommates,

01:19:52.245 --> 01:19:54.956
maybe playing a joke
or something like that.

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.209
I turned around and there was, you know,

01:19:57.292 --> 01:19:59.461
a man standing there
with a gun in his hand.

01:20:00.962 --> 01:20:02.589
You know, very surreal.

01:20:02.672 --> 01:20:06.593
You know, it's sort of...
people describe... sort of slow motion.

01:20:06.676 --> 01:20:09.638
And that's sort of what I, you know,
went through at that point.

01:20:09.721 --> 01:20:12.849
My, sort of, heart,
at that point was in my throat.

01:20:12.933 --> 01:20:16.937
You know, I could feel my sort of...
constriction, in my throat.

01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:19.689
And I basically made a break for the door,

01:20:20.482 --> 01:20:24.110
you know, giving him the money,
and then there was an explosion.

01:20:25.403 --> 01:20:29.032
And, you know,
I remember actually more the sound first,

01:20:29.115 --> 01:20:31.535
and then this feeling,

01:20:31.618 --> 01:20:35.956
like someone had just, you know...
punched me in the kidney, right?

01:20:36.039 --> 01:20:37.040
And...

01:20:37.791 --> 01:20:39.626
And it was this huge disconnect.

01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:42.337
It just... the explosion was one thing,

01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:46.883
And then there was this feeling in my...
like a really hard punch to the kidney.

01:20:48.134 --> 01:20:50.262
And then it was suddenly this realization.

01:20:50.345 --> 01:20:52.264
"Oh, my God, I've been... He shot me."

01:20:52.347 --> 01:20:55.058
And I remember yelling out, like,
"Oh my God, he shot me."

01:20:56.309 --> 01:20:57.769
And then he was gone.

01:20:57.853 --> 01:21:00.647
I remember thinking,
"I'm not going to die here. Not today.

01:21:00.730 --> 01:21:02.774
Not here on the streets of Brooklyn."

01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:04.484
And... sorry.

01:21:09.155 --> 01:21:12.659
So I put my hand behind my back,
because I was like, "What is that?"

01:21:12.742 --> 01:21:16.121
Like I was feeling, like... moisture.

01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:20.542
And my hand was soaked in blood.

01:21:22.794 --> 01:21:24.087
I'm dying.

01:21:24.671 --> 01:21:26.214
So I...

01:21:26.756 --> 01:21:28.717
I just need to get to a live person,

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:31.469
someone I can talk to
who's going to know what to do.

01:21:31.553 --> 01:21:34.139
I knew the one place
you always find people is the subway,

01:21:34.222 --> 01:21:36.516
and also the token clerk, and...

01:21:37.475 --> 01:21:40.854
So I actually had a badge,
as a prosecutor,

01:21:40.937 --> 01:21:44.566
and you know, I pulled out my badge
and I said, "Help me, I've been shot."

01:21:44.649 --> 01:21:48.153
And I sort of put it up
against the window and...

01:21:48.236 --> 01:21:51.823
She was like, "OK, alright," you know,
"Hold on, honey. Hold on, honey."

01:21:51.907 --> 01:21:55.493
And, you know, she quickly made a call
on something and then she came out,

01:21:55.577 --> 01:21:58.079
which, I found out later,
is against all protocol.

01:21:58.163 --> 01:21:59.331
But...

01:22:00.165 --> 01:22:02.042
it was this moment of humanity.

01:22:02.125 --> 01:22:03.293
She...

01:22:06.922 --> 01:22:08.256
She just held me.

01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:12.928
And... she encouraged me to sit down,
and I was afraid to shut my eyes,

01:22:13.011 --> 01:22:15.555
because if I fall asleep,
I'm not going to wake up.

01:22:17.474 --> 01:22:18.767
So...

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:20.894
Sorry.

01:22:25.565 --> 01:22:28.360
They got me up.
They got me into an ambulance.

01:22:28.443 --> 01:22:30.462
I didn't realize that
they shut down the

01:22:30.467 --> 01:22:32.405
Brooklyn Bridge, to get
me over there.

01:22:32.989 --> 01:22:34.991
The other thing I had a
vague memory of,

01:22:35.075 --> 01:22:37.327
when I was still down
in the subway...

01:22:37.869 --> 01:22:39.913
These two guys coming up and one saying,

01:22:39.996 --> 01:22:42.457
"Hey, man, what happened?
Where did you go?"

01:22:43.375 --> 01:22:47.545
You know. "We saw you, we saw you."
Or, you know, "We couldn't find you."

01:22:47.629 --> 01:22:50.465
And again, I found out later
from the prosecutor

01:22:50.548 --> 01:22:52.217
that one of them was your brother.

01:22:52.926 --> 01:22:55.136
Or was your brother or his friend.

01:22:56.012 --> 01:22:57.931
They apparently had seen part of it,

01:22:58.014 --> 01:23:01.184
or had seen this...
one of the guys running away.

01:23:01.267 --> 01:23:04.062
And I guess one of them
would chase after the guy,

01:23:04.145 --> 01:23:05.897
and one of them went to try to find me.

01:23:08.775 --> 01:23:11.361
Mr. Ford's testimony was basically,

01:23:11.444 --> 01:23:15.073
the guy was running right down the middle
of the street, and he ran after him.

01:23:15.156 --> 01:23:18.076
The guy with the gun.
And jumped on him, and caught him.

01:23:18.159 --> 01:23:20.912
That's my remembrance
of what had happened.

01:23:21.454 --> 01:23:24.749
And I remember that we made an X
right in the middle of the street,

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:27.252
on a picture,
as to where that had happened.

01:23:29.713 --> 01:23:31.673
I mean, he just, he reacted,

01:23:31.756 --> 01:23:35.260
and I was trying to remember,
was he in the service or something?

01:23:35.343 --> 01:23:37.554
What gave him the training or ability

01:23:37.637 --> 01:23:42.058
to handle himself
in such a... effective way?

01:23:42.142 --> 01:23:43.685
You know? Fearless.

01:23:45.854 --> 01:23:49.524
It was a... it was a heroic act, I think.

01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:58.408
[Yance, reading] "January 1st, 1992.
It's a new year.

01:23:58.491 --> 01:24:00.785
I'd said I was not going
to make any resolutions,

01:24:00.869 --> 01:24:04.247
but there are some goals that I
would like to get accomplished.

01:24:04.330 --> 01:24:07.751
One. By June 1st, I would like
to be a corrections officer.

01:24:07.834 --> 01:24:10.045
Or I will be back in school.

01:24:10.128 --> 01:24:11.921
These are my only two options.

01:24:12.005 --> 01:24:15.800
Two. This year,
I want to stand and not falter.

01:24:15.884 --> 01:24:19.512
I want to calm some of my fears.
I want to feel peaceful.

01:24:19.596 --> 01:24:22.223
This is the year for me to find me.

01:24:22.307 --> 01:24:23.308
January 2nd.

01:24:23.391 --> 01:24:27.270
It's only the second day of the year
and already I'm feeling lonely.

01:24:27.937 --> 01:24:32.108
I'm tired of every aspect of my life
having an undecided feeling.

01:24:32.734 --> 01:24:33.777
January 7th.

01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:37.489
When I got home, there was a letter
from the Department of Corrections,

01:24:37.572 --> 01:24:40.784
telling me I have 30 days
to come in for my weigh-in.

01:24:41.826 --> 01:24:44.085
I'm on a two-day
fast, and will be

01:24:44.090 --> 01:24:46.998
back down to 245
by Wednesday.

01:24:47.791 --> 01:24:50.835
I couldn't ask
for a more powerful motivation.

01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:52.837
40,000 dollars a year!

01:24:52.921 --> 01:24:55.548
I've been trying to get this job
for almost two years,

01:24:55.632 --> 01:24:58.760
and now it all comes down
to the next 28 days.

01:24:58.843 --> 01:25:02.138
The only thing that I must remember
is that there can be no failure.

01:25:02.222 --> 01:25:03.848
There is no starting over.

01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:07.143
This is the last chance I'm going to get,
and I must take it.

01:25:08.478 --> 01:25:10.897
January 9th. I'm at 241.

01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:14.359
My next goal is to be at 230 by the 19th.

01:25:14.442 --> 01:25:18.363
The goal after that is 225 by the 25th.

01:25:18.446 --> 01:25:22.575
Then, if I am down to 220 by the 30th,

01:25:22.659 --> 01:25:24.994
I will go in on the 31st.

01:25:25.078 --> 01:25:28.790
And I still have two tricks up my sleeve
that I've been holding in reserve:

01:25:28.873 --> 01:25:31.459
Ex-Lax and Lasix.

01:25:33.545 --> 01:25:34.963
January 28th.

01:25:35.672 --> 01:25:37.924
The only problem is,
I think I'm getting sick.

01:25:38.508 --> 01:25:40.927
I'm feeling weaker
than I have felt the whole time.

01:25:41.469 --> 01:25:42.887
I have to hang on until Friday.

01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:46.141
I don't care if I have to crawl
into the place. I will not give up.

01:25:47.142 --> 01:25:49.978
January 30th. The last day.

01:25:50.061 --> 01:25:52.772
I do know that this
is a chance to start over,

01:25:52.856 --> 01:25:54.691
with a whole new everything.

01:25:55.275 --> 01:25:56.985
It's not just a new job,

01:25:57.610 --> 01:25:58.862
it's a new adventure.

01:25:59.863 --> 01:26:02.282
Pull this off, and then you can...

01:26:03.491 --> 01:26:06.786
actually make
a small chunk of the world yours.

01:26:08.246 --> 01:26:12.333
Pull this off, and you can actually make
a small chunk of the world yours.

01:26:12.417 --> 01:26:13.626
Just do it."

01:26:24.095 --> 01:26:25.430
"Dear Candidate,

01:26:26.014 --> 01:26:29.475
This is in reply to your appeal
to the City Civil Service Commission

01:26:29.559 --> 01:26:31.884
of your disqualification
for appointment

01:26:31.889 --> 01:26:34.314
to the above position,
Correction Officer,

01:26:34.397 --> 01:26:36.524
for medical reasons: weight.

01:26:37.442 --> 01:26:40.195
The City Personnel Director
has granted your appeal,

01:26:40.278 --> 01:26:42.488
and you have been marked: qualified."

01:26:44.324 --> 01:26:46.326
It's May 15th,

01:26:46.409 --> 01:26:49.245
so he has been dead now...

01:26:53.583 --> 01:26:55.376
He's been dead for six weeks.

01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:01.716
But, hey,

01:27:02.258 --> 01:27:03.927
he's medically qualified.

01:27:08.306 --> 01:27:10.183
[phone rings]

01:27:13.811 --> 01:27:14.854
[Barbara] Hello?

01:27:15.396 --> 01:27:16.856
Hi!

01:27:17.857 --> 01:27:20.193
Oh, I'm getting there.

01:27:20.276 --> 01:27:22.695
I had my eyes done.

01:27:23.363 --> 01:27:26.908
I certainly look as if
I fought with Muhammad Ali,

01:27:26.991 --> 01:27:29.869
he beat me up, went and had dinner,

01:27:29.953 --> 01:27:33.206
and came back
and punched me in the face some more!

01:27:34.207 --> 01:27:36.376
[laughs]

01:27:37.252 --> 01:27:39.295
The children are doing well.

01:27:39.379 --> 01:27:41.256
They're not children anymore.

01:27:41.798 --> 01:27:43.633
They tell me what to do.

01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:47.762
But every now and then,
you've got to put them back in place.

01:27:48.346 --> 01:27:52.183
You've got to let them know
that you're still the boss.

01:27:53.059 --> 01:27:55.061
I'm still the boss, Yance.

01:27:55.144 --> 01:27:56.729
[Yance] I always knew that.

01:27:56.813 --> 01:27:58.147
[Barbara laughs]

01:27:58.231 --> 01:27:59.816
[Barbara] Thank you for calling.

01:27:59.899 --> 01:28:04.237
You brought bright rays of sunshine
in my life.

01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:10.076
What are you doing now?

01:28:10.159 --> 01:28:13.705
I want to make sure that there's
ice going down the side of your cheek.

01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:16.207
Like, to this place, here.

01:28:16.291 --> 01:28:17.458
OK.

01:28:17.542 --> 01:28:20.253
And down the side of here, also.

01:28:21.087 --> 01:28:24.299
You know, so that we get
some ice on the corners.

01:28:24.382 --> 01:28:29.220
So why don't you put a piece of tape
from here, back there?

01:28:29.304 --> 01:28:32.015
And if you need to take
the earring out, you can.

01:28:32.515 --> 01:28:35.018
[Hughes] From what I was able
to put together...

01:28:36.227 --> 01:28:39.188
...there was a car accident
on February 16th.

01:28:39.272 --> 01:28:41.324
Apparently, it was with
a Super Stang

01:28:41.329 --> 01:28:43.109
vehicle, driven by
Mark Reilly.

01:28:43.192 --> 01:28:45.403
There was an agreement made
at the scene

01:28:45.486 --> 01:28:47.697
that Super Stang would fix the car.

01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:50.074
Then time started to stretch out.

01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:53.189
By March 19th, Lesline
and your mom went

01:28:53.194 --> 01:28:56.039
to the shop to see what
was going on.

01:28:56.122 --> 01:29:01.502
Mark Reilly may have said something
that got your mom... your mom upset,

01:29:01.586 --> 01:29:03.171
which got William upset.

01:29:03.254 --> 01:29:06.090
And William went to the shop
with Kevin Myers.

01:29:06.174 --> 01:29:08.509
William was speaking to
Thomas Datre.

01:29:08.593 --> 01:29:10.970
Coincidentally, he's in the news
now. Have you seen it?

01:29:11.054 --> 01:29:11.888
[Yance] I have.

01:29:11.971 --> 01:29:13.639
[Hughes]
William was talking to Datre.

01:29:13.723 --> 01:29:16.059
He was very angry
because he'd upset his mother.

01:29:16.142 --> 01:29:17.894
He was described as "shaking
with anger."

01:29:17.977 --> 01:29:20.313
Wanted to know
who disrespected his mother.

01:29:20.396 --> 01:29:23.649
He picked up a car door and was
about to throw it, from a Corvette.

01:29:23.733 --> 01:29:25.686
The girl who owned the
Corvette was there

01:29:25.691 --> 01:29:27.487
and stepped in. He put
the door down.

01:29:27.570 --> 01:29:30.448
At that time William picked up a
vacuum, put it over his head.

01:29:30.531 --> 01:29:33.201
The water kind of,
like, fell out onto him,

01:29:33.284 --> 01:29:35.828
and he threw the vacuum
and broke it.

01:29:35.912 --> 01:29:39.040
He picked up a hammer, and began...
He came at Mark Reilly.

01:29:39.123 --> 01:29:40.708
I guess he held him responsible,

01:29:40.792 --> 01:29:43.961
because he may have been the one
who disrespected your mom.

01:29:44.045 --> 01:29:47.131
He never swung it at him, never hit
him, he never threatened him.

01:29:47.215 --> 01:29:49.342
-But he had the hammer in his hand.
-Right.

01:29:49.425 --> 01:29:50.551
Mark was petrified.

01:29:50.635 --> 01:29:53.763
But other members there,
they actually were kind of, like...

01:29:54.305 --> 01:29:55.139
laughing at him.

01:29:55.223 --> 01:29:57.308
And they were calling him
a little girl.

01:29:57.313 --> 01:29:59.227
I mean, he was obviously
frightened.

01:29:59.310 --> 01:30:01.813
Your brother was a big guy,
and he was intimidated.

01:30:02.522 --> 01:30:04.357
After that, William went home,

01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:06.651
and your mom noticed
that he was soaking wet.

01:30:06.734 --> 01:30:08.986
Asked what happened, and he said

01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:11.614
that he was... he was wet
with sweat from the gym.

01:30:12.281 --> 01:30:14.408
And I followed up on that.
I went to the gym.

01:30:14.492 --> 01:30:16.786
But your brother had not been
at the gym that day.

01:30:17.370 --> 01:30:21.582
I was there,
the night of the... Corvette incident.

01:30:22.542 --> 01:30:26.170
You know, William kept saying,
"What do I have to do?

01:30:26.254 --> 01:30:30.508
Why isn't my car being fixed?
You got time to work on everything else."

01:30:30.591 --> 01:30:33.511
And he's... kind of like this.
And then he saw the Corvette.

01:30:33.594 --> 01:30:37.306
I was like, "No, not the Corvette!"
You know, kind of like that, you know.

01:30:37.390 --> 01:30:38.724
And,

01:30:39.433 --> 01:30:40.977
he never damaged the car.

01:30:41.519 --> 01:30:45.231
And it wasn't a situation.
Because there were guys laughing.

01:30:45.314 --> 01:30:48.985
There were people, like... I don't want
to use the word "egging him on,"

01:30:49.068 --> 01:30:50.278
but clowning with him.

01:30:50.361 --> 01:30:53.990
We were laughing, and clowning, and...

01:30:54.532 --> 01:30:58.119
I'd say there were ten to 15 people there.
Scared of what?

01:30:58.786 --> 01:31:00.619
[Hughes] The vehicle was
subsequently

01:31:00.624 --> 01:31:02.623
released to your... to
your mom, I guess.

01:31:02.707 --> 01:31:04.555
There was something
about somebody

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:06.544
from the shop following
the car home,

01:31:07.086 --> 01:31:10.631
and as a result of that,
on April 7th,

01:31:10.715 --> 01:31:13.676
Kevin Myers, again with William,
returned to Super Stang.

01:31:13.759 --> 01:31:16.137
And William was yelling
at Tom Datre,

01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:19.557
and ultimately sees Mark,
and goes after Mark.

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:23.895
Mark retreated into the paint room,
where he grabbed a rifle.

01:31:24.979 --> 01:31:27.398
Your brother walked into the paint
room and approached,

01:31:27.481 --> 01:31:29.901
made a comment about,
"What are you gonna do with that?".

01:31:29.984 --> 01:31:31.068
He came at him.

01:31:31.152 --> 01:31:33.779
And Mark fired one shot.
Hit him in the chest.

01:31:34.322 --> 01:31:35.489
Right.

01:31:36.365 --> 01:31:39.452
There was no stone left unturned in
this, I can tell you that.

01:31:39.535 --> 01:31:41.954
It's just... an unfortunate thing.

01:31:42.038 --> 01:31:45.041
I mean, I certainly put every effort
into this being, you know,

01:31:45.124 --> 01:31:48.169
into this being covered
100 percent, 110 percent.

01:31:55.051 --> 01:31:57.803
[Yance, reading] "April 1st, 1992.

01:31:58.346 --> 01:32:00.890
Tomorrow, I have to go to court
in downtown Brooklyn,

01:32:00.973 --> 01:32:03.351
for my first day of testimony
in the Breen case.

01:32:04.352 --> 01:32:06.771
Mr. Boyar is expecting me
by ten o'clock.

01:32:07.563 --> 01:32:10.650
I need to pick up my suit from the
dry cleaners before they close."

01:32:11.567 --> 01:32:16.155
This is where William was
on April 2nd: Kings County Court.

01:32:16.906 --> 01:32:19.325
This is where William was, April 3rd:

01:32:19.408 --> 01:32:21.744
testifying for the prosecution.

01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:25.039
This is where William was
on Monday, April 6th.

01:32:25.748 --> 01:32:30.419
This is where William was
on Tuesday, April 7th.

01:32:31.087 --> 01:32:34.632
Kings County Court,
testifying for the prosecution.

01:32:36.842 --> 01:32:38.675
[Hughes] The vehicle was
subsequently

01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:40.680
released to your... to
your mom, I guess.

01:32:40.763 --> 01:32:42.470
There was something
about somebody

01:32:42.475 --> 01:32:44.308
from the shop following
the car home,

01:32:44.392 --> 01:32:46.477
and... as a result of that,

01:32:47.019 --> 01:32:50.231
on April 7th,
William returned to Super Stang.

01:32:50.314 --> 01:32:53.359
And I think it was just, you know...

01:32:53.442 --> 01:32:56.529
your brother was caught up
in what had happened to your mom.

01:32:57.780 --> 01:32:59.365
[Kevin] I get out. Ford gets out.

01:32:59.448 --> 01:33:01.236
I remember him going
into the yard and

01:33:01.241 --> 01:33:02.994
somebody coming out of
the shop door,

01:33:03.077 --> 01:33:04.662
and meeting him in the yard.

01:33:04.745 --> 01:33:07.581
Words started getting exchanged,
and I said, "Oh, here we go."

01:33:08.124 --> 01:33:11.669
William was arguing outside, in the yard,

01:33:11.752 --> 01:33:14.630
with someone other than the kid
who shot him at the time?

01:33:14.714 --> 01:33:16.173
-Correct.
-[Yance] OK.

01:33:16.257 --> 01:33:20.386
So, the person he was arguing with
was Tom Datre, Jr.

01:33:20.469 --> 01:33:22.847
-He was sort of the owner of the shop?
-Right.

01:33:23.431 --> 01:33:26.851
And that the person who was
in the back, with the rifle...

01:33:27.435 --> 01:33:29.186
Excuse me. His name was Mark Reilly.

01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:31.022
He was an employee of the shop.

01:33:31.647 --> 01:33:32.481
Right.

01:33:33.274 --> 01:33:37.778
I read that Datre Jr. had been,
two years before that...

01:33:38.696 --> 01:33:41.365
arrested for, essentially,

01:33:41.449 --> 01:33:44.660
running a chop-shop out of the garage
at his parents' house.

01:33:45.411 --> 01:33:47.496
He recruited kids,

01:33:47.580 --> 01:33:50.541
and paid them to steal cars.

01:33:50.624 --> 01:33:54.462
And then he chopped up the cars,
and sold... sold off the pieces.

01:33:56.964 --> 01:33:58.799
What I'm trying to figure out is...

01:34:00.593 --> 01:34:03.095
what happened, if anything?

01:34:03.179 --> 01:34:08.476
What did William say,
if anything, to Tom Datre Jr.,

01:34:08.559 --> 01:34:11.896
when they were in the yard,
outside of the garage?

01:34:12.938 --> 01:34:15.191
[Kevin] You know,
he didn't make any threats.

01:34:15.274 --> 01:34:17.360
He didn't say, "I'm gonna beat you up."

01:34:17.443 --> 01:34:20.696
He says, "I got accepted to Police Academy
and Corrections Academy.

01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:23.449
When I become either one,
I am telling you,

01:34:23.532 --> 01:34:25.993
I'm going to get this place shut down."

01:34:27.870 --> 01:34:30.122
Ford was serious about what he was saying,

01:34:30.206 --> 01:34:33.793
but he wasn't doing anything...
anything that night,

01:34:34.627 --> 01:34:38.297
to provoke a fight, or to get shot.

01:34:38.381 --> 01:34:42.218
It was a conversation.
"I'm gonna do this, once I become a cop."

01:34:42.301 --> 01:34:46.389
Then we started to walk away.
That's when Mark walked out.

01:34:46.931 --> 01:34:49.975
He didn't look surprised.
He didn't look panicked.

01:34:50.601 --> 01:34:53.854
He just glanced and made a U-turn,
and went back into the garage.

01:34:54.647 --> 01:34:57.483
That's when William looked at me
and he just kind of went,

01:34:58.025 --> 01:35:00.111
"That's the guy
that cursed out my mother."

01:35:00.194 --> 01:35:01.195
I was like...

01:35:02.321 --> 01:35:05.950
William turned. He didn't say anything.
He just turned and he walked.

01:35:06.033 --> 01:35:08.494
And he got to the doorway. He made a left.

01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:11.038
So then, we heard a pop.

01:35:12.289 --> 01:35:17.545
There was no:
"Stop! I'll shoot you! I'm scared!"

01:35:18.087 --> 01:35:19.839
No scuffle, no fight.

01:35:19.922 --> 01:35:22.133
William turned and was shot.

01:35:26.470 --> 01:35:29.890
I don't understand the self-defense,
because there were options.

01:35:29.974 --> 01:35:31.845
There had to be a back
door to the place.

01:35:31.850 --> 01:35:33.227
He could have went
that way.

01:35:33.769 --> 01:35:36.272
I'm sure some door had a
lock behind it.

01:35:36.355 --> 01:35:38.732
Even when they say,
"This happened a month ago,"

01:35:38.816 --> 01:35:40.794
or "He was afraid," or
this and that...

01:35:40.799 --> 01:35:42.653
OK, so a month ago, you
were afraid.

01:35:43.195 --> 01:35:45.239
If that even was the
truth that night.

01:35:46.907 --> 01:35:48.784
And after leaving...

01:35:50.453 --> 01:35:51.996
the Grand Jury,

01:35:53.747 --> 01:35:57.168
I kind of got in the car,
and I kind of knew... what they were at.

01:35:57.251 --> 01:35:59.211
I didn't know if it would work,

01:35:59.295 --> 01:36:02.256
but I strongly felt

01:36:02.339 --> 01:36:07.261
that everything was being made
to present a case of...

01:36:07.845 --> 01:36:11.265
"Mark was scared.
He did what he did because he was scared."

01:36:12.933 --> 01:36:15.436
[Yance, reading]
"Gunshot wound of the right chest.

01:36:15.519 --> 01:36:18.981
Hemorrhagic wound track,
perforating right chest wall,

01:36:19.064 --> 01:36:24.028
mediastinum, heart, left lung,
and left chest wall.

01:36:24.653 --> 01:36:28.908
Wound path: front to back,
right to left and downward.

01:36:29.492 --> 01:36:32.953
Deformed, non-jacketed,
small caliber bullet recovered.

01:36:33.496 --> 01:36:36.707
There is no evidence of gunpowder
stippling or soot deposition

01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:38.542
on the skin around the wound."

01:36:39.418 --> 01:36:42.046
There is no evidence
of close range firing.

01:36:43.631 --> 01:36:47.301
How do you measure
the distance of reasonable fear?

01:36:52.806 --> 01:36:54.850
[Yance] What are the
contours of fear?

01:36:58.479 --> 01:37:00.189
What do your eyes tell you?

01:37:00.814 --> 01:37:04.235
[soft, eerie music]

01:37:08.239 --> 01:37:10.032
[Yance] Do you see my brother?

01:37:16.580 --> 01:37:19.833
[music swells]

01:37:19.917 --> 01:37:22.419
[Yance] Dredge the river
and you will find him.

01:37:24.838 --> 01:37:27.174
Or someone who could have been him.

01:37:34.848 --> 01:37:36.892
So you tell me,

01:37:37.434 --> 01:37:40.104
whose fear is reasonable?

01:37:44.817 --> 01:37:47.903
[music fades]

01:37:50.281 --> 01:37:51.782
[Yance, reading] "The body is cold,

01:37:51.865 --> 01:37:55.494
and rigor is present and fixed to
an equal degree in all extremities.

01:37:56.370 --> 01:37:58.747
There is an earring hole
in the left earlobe.

01:37:59.456 --> 01:38:02.251
No tattoos or needle tracks
are observed.

01:38:02.793 --> 01:38:05.379
The irides are brown,
the cornea are cloudy,

01:38:05.462 --> 01:38:07.715
the conjunctivae are unremarkable.

01:38:08.674 --> 01:38:10.593
The liver is unremarkable.

01:38:11.552 --> 01:38:13.637
The kidneys are unremarkable.

01:38:15.097 --> 01:38:16.473
The heart...

01:38:16.557 --> 01:38:17.975
is unremarkable."

01:38:25.649 --> 01:38:31.363
I looked at... the Grand Jury.

01:38:32.197 --> 01:38:34.408
I looked around.

01:38:34.491 --> 01:38:37.244
I saw who was paying attention.

01:38:38.037 --> 01:38:38.912
OK?

01:38:38.996 --> 01:38:43.000
How could you come to a viable decision,

01:38:43.083 --> 01:38:45.210
if you're reading a magazine,

01:38:45.294 --> 01:38:47.463
if you're doing a crossword puzzle,

01:38:47.546 --> 01:38:49.673
if you're talking with somebody?

01:38:50.215 --> 01:38:53.093
I think serving on a jury,

01:38:53.177 --> 01:38:55.638
and particularly a Grand Jury,

01:38:55.721 --> 01:38:59.558
is one of the greatest... privileges

01:38:59.642 --> 01:39:02.519
of citizenship in this country.

01:39:03.604 --> 01:39:07.149
And you shouldn't take it that way,

01:39:07.691 --> 01:39:10.861
based on race, creed or color.

01:39:11.403 --> 01:39:16.158
You should judge the content
of the evidence presented.

01:39:16.867 --> 01:39:20.996
My feelings were
that they just didn't give a damn.

01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:25.542
And if I die today,
tomorrow or the next day,

01:39:25.626 --> 01:39:29.088
I will die believing
that they didn't care,

01:39:29.171 --> 01:39:33.300
because my son was a young man of color.

01:39:33.384 --> 01:39:36.762
I will always believe that. Always.

01:39:36.845 --> 01:39:38.514
Until the day I die.

01:39:42.685 --> 01:39:44.395
[bird chirps]

01:39:49.942 --> 01:39:54.113
[Yance] It was election day and...
four o'clock in the morning,

01:39:54.863 --> 01:39:56.365
the phone rings.

01:39:56.448 --> 01:40:00.953
I knew because of the time
that something was wrong.

01:40:05.416 --> 01:40:09.128
[breathing through tube]

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:15.008
[machine beeping]

01:40:23.726 --> 01:40:27.146
[breathing continues]

01:40:43.203 --> 01:40:46.790
[Yance] And there was this...
one day,

01:40:47.332 --> 01:40:49.418
before she was in a coma,

01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:55.299
where I thought that she was trying
to pull herself up in bed.

01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:59.052
And I had given her my right hand,

01:41:00.053 --> 01:41:01.764
to, you know...

01:41:02.806 --> 01:41:06.810
I had offered my right hand,
for her to grasp with her right hand.

01:41:07.519 --> 01:41:10.439
And I thought she was trying
to pull herself up.

01:41:11.190 --> 01:41:13.609
And really she was trying
to pull me toward her.

01:41:14.777 --> 01:41:16.111
And...

01:41:16.987 --> 01:41:19.698
it took me a good five minutes
to realize that...

01:41:20.365 --> 01:41:23.368
I was trying to make my mother
more comfortable in bed,

01:41:23.452 --> 01:41:25.954
and what she wanted was for me to hug her.

01:41:40.427 --> 01:41:44.723
[soft, eerie music]

01:42:07.955 --> 01:42:11.124
[music swells]

01:42:22.761 --> 01:42:26.557
[music builds further]

01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:42.239
[Yance] You stumble out of the
garage and into the yard,

01:42:42.781 --> 01:42:44.074
where you fall.

01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:50.998
You lie on the ground,
hole in your chest,

01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:53.000
another in your lung.

01:42:56.545 --> 01:43:00.549
You feel the pain and know you
will never see your sisters again.

01:43:01.091 --> 01:43:03.635
Your mother. Your father.

01:43:05.762 --> 01:43:08.181
You wonder how
your family will survive this.

01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:12.477
You realize
that you will not survive this.

01:43:14.479 --> 01:43:19.192
You realize you starved yourself
for 32 days, for nothing.

01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:24.573
You lie on the ground,
bullet through your heart.

01:43:25.616 --> 01:43:28.952
You can't speak, and no
one speaks to you.

01:43:30.704 --> 01:43:33.014
You do not know your death
may, in fact,

01:43:33.019 --> 01:43:35.042
be the actual death
of our family.

01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:39.671
You do not know
that we are silent in our grief,

01:43:39.755 --> 01:43:41.381
even with one another.

01:43:43.175 --> 01:43:45.928
You do not know your killer will say
he had to shoot you.

01:43:47.763 --> 01:43:51.183
You do not know your killer
will make you out to be a monster.

01:43:52.559 --> 01:43:54.770
Mark Reilly will make you out
to be a monster,

01:43:54.853 --> 01:43:56.438
and people will believe him.

01:43:58.231 --> 01:44:00.651
You do not realize
that there will be no trial.

01:44:02.152 --> 01:44:05.155
You don't know
that 23 white people will decide

01:44:05.238 --> 01:44:07.616
no crime has even been committed.

01:44:09.534 --> 01:44:12.120
You realize there may be no Heaven.

01:44:14.039 --> 01:44:15.749
There may only be the ground.

01:44:23.465 --> 01:44:26.551
[distant city noise]

01:45:07.426 --> 01:45:10.053
[Ray Charles: "Let the Good Times Roll"]

01:45:10.846 --> 01:45:12.389
Let's have some fun

01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:16.935
You only live but once
And when you're dead, you're done

01:45:17.019 --> 01:45:19.271
 So let the good times roll

01:45:21.314 --> 01:45:23.817
 I said, let the good times roll

01:45:26.445 --> 01:45:29.031
 I don't care if you're young or old

01:45:29.114 --> 01:45:32.451
 You ought to get together

01:45:35.996 --> 01:45:39.791
 Don't sit there mumbling
Talking trash

01:45:40.751 --> 01:45:44.379
If you want to have a ball You've
got to go out and spend some cash

01:45:44.463 --> 01:45:47.424
 And let the good times roll, now

01:45:48.717 --> 01:45:50.761
 I'm talking about the good times

01:45:53.430 --> 01:45:56.266
 Well, it makes no difference
Whether you're young or old

01:45:56.349 --> 01:46:00.062
 All you've got to do is get together

01:46:03.231 --> 01:46:06.902
[brass solo]

01:46:31.051 --> 01:46:34.930
 Hey, you all, tell everybody
Ray Charles is in town

01:46:35.889 --> 01:46:39.810
 I got a dollar and a quarter
And I'm just ringing the clock

01:46:40.352 --> 01:46:44.564
But don't let no female
play me cheap

01:46:44.648 --> 01:46:49.528
 I've got 50 cents more
Than I'm gonna keep

01:46:49.611 --> 01:46:51.947
 So let the good times roll

01:46:54.116 --> 01:46:57.828
 I tell you all I'm gonna let
