<i>erican Teenager...</i>

00:03.056 --> 00:04.957
Are those invitations
to my shower?

00:04.992 --> 00:07.126
Maybe you'd give me a list of
friends you'd like to invite.

00:07.160 --> 00:08.494
I don't have any friends.

00:08.528 --> 00:09.996
I want to invite
the girls who thought

00:10.030 --> 00:12.231
that I got just what I deserved
when I got pregnant.

00:12.266 --> 00:14.834
Did you do that
just to show how many girls
Ricky slept with?

00:14.868 --> 00:17.136
Amy, this isn't about you.
This is about me.

00:17.170 --> 00:19.572
[Ricky] You don't know
anything about that fight,
and neither do I.

00:19.606 --> 00:21.507
Let's stay out of it,
and that's the last time
I'm saying that.

00:21.575 --> 00:24.810
Poor Grace.
It got really tough.

00:24.845 --> 00:26.512
Complain, complain, complain.

00:26.546 --> 00:28.014
I can't believe
you just said that.

00:28.048 --> 00:30.616
Do you really love Ricky,
or do you just want to justify

00:30.651 --> 00:32.518
getting pregnant
by him in the first place?

00:32.552 --> 00:34.754
All I know is your son
came over my house tonight

00:34.788 --> 00:36.422
and said some horrible things
to my daughter.

00:36.456 --> 00:37.423
But from his perspective,

00:37.457 --> 00:38.991
those horrible things are true.

00:39.026 --> 00:40.760
I don't want to be part
of all this.

00:40.794 --> 00:42.995
I don't really think
you should be getting married.

00:43.030 --> 00:44.864
If you don't want to be
friends with Adrian,

00:44.898 --> 00:46.699
then you don't want to be
friends with me.

00:46.733 --> 00:48.868
You still care about me?

00:51.171 --> 00:52.605
You really didn't care

00:52.639 --> 00:54.140
if you completely destroyed
my relationship with Ricky

00:54.174 --> 00:55.174
just to have a little fun.

00:55.208 --> 00:56.175
And you didn't really care

00:56.209 --> 00:58.010
if you completely destroyed
this family

00:58.045 --> 01:00.179
just to have a little fun
at band camp.

01:02.482 --> 01:05.785
John, did you see where Mommy
put her English book?

01:05.819 --> 01:07.019
It's in here somewhere.

01:07.054 --> 01:08.554
It's got to be in here
somewhere.

01:08.588 --> 01:11.357
[sighs]
John, I really need
my English Lit book.

01:11.391 --> 01:12.692
I haven't finished my homework,

01:12.726 --> 01:14.327
and we're going to be late.

01:15.529 --> 01:17.163
Morning.

01:17.197 --> 01:18.331
Morning, John.

01:18.365 --> 01:20.132
What are you doing here?

01:20.167 --> 01:21.934
No, never mind
what you're doing here.

01:21.968 --> 01:24.236
Whatever you're doing here,
can you take John
to the nursery?

01:24.271 --> 01:26.672
I'm late.
I stayed up too late,
I got up too late,

01:26.707 --> 01:28.007
and I can't find
my English Lit book,

01:28.041 --> 01:29.308
and I haven't done my homework.

01:29.343 --> 01:30.743
I'm surprised you had
any time with homework

01:30.777 --> 01:32.178
with Ben being over here
last night.

01:32.212 --> 01:34.447
I was going to tell you
when I saw you at school.

01:34.481 --> 01:35.681
Really?
Yeah.

01:35.716 --> 01:36.882
Maybe not at school,

01:36.917 --> 01:38.284
but I was definitely going to
tell you tonight,

01:38.318 --> 01:39.919
if I told you--

01:39.953 --> 01:41.153
Is that why you're over here?

01:41.188 --> 01:42.421
Are you upset
that Ben was over here?

01:42.456 --> 01:43.823
I told him to stay away
from you

01:43.857 --> 01:45.491
and let you and Adrian
work things out.

01:45.525 --> 01:46.959
Yeah, I know.

01:46.993 --> 01:49.095
If you knew, why didn't you
tell me he was over here?

01:49.129 --> 01:51.464
I really don't have time
for this, this morning.
Can you take John?

01:51.498 --> 01:53.666
Yeah, I'll take him, but I want
to know what Ben said to you.

01:53.700 --> 01:55.968
I don't remember the details.

01:56.002 --> 01:58.371
It's all kind of a blur.

01:58.405 --> 02:00.673
I'm really running late.
Can we talk later?

02:00.707 --> 02:01.707
Can we talk now?

02:01.742 --> 02:02.875
How did you know Ben
was over here?

02:02.909 --> 02:04.977
Adrian told me.
When did you talk to Adrian?

02:05.011 --> 02:07.446
When I called her
to ask her to come over here
and apologize to you.

02:07.481 --> 02:10.583
Oh, so you don't really think we
can work things out ourselves.

02:10.616 --> 02:12.118
It didn't look like
it was going that way.

02:12.152 --> 02:14.453
I don't want Adrian to come
over here and apologize to me.

02:14.488 --> 02:16.956
Why not?
Because that would make her
the bigger person.

02:16.990 --> 02:18.224
Then you apologize to her.

02:18.258 --> 02:19.658
I'm not apologizing to her.

02:19.693 --> 02:21.894
If anyone owes anyone
an apology, it's you.

02:21.928 --> 02:24.330
For what?

02:24.364 --> 02:25.898
You knew I slept
with other girls.

02:25.932 --> 02:27.466
You can't expect me
to apologize

02:27.501 --> 02:28.801
for sleeping with other girls

02:28.869 --> 02:30.669
just because you know
who some of them are now.

02:30.704 --> 02:32.171
Did you ever tell them
that you love them?

02:32.205 --> 02:34.874
Ah, then you do remember
what Ben said.

02:34.908 --> 02:37.610
Yeah, you told Ben,
and he told me.

02:37.644 --> 02:39.044
You should've been
the one to tell me.

02:39.079 --> 02:40.479
Why?
Why?

02:40.514 --> 02:42.415
Because I thought
we told each other everything.

02:42.449 --> 02:43.883
No, apparently not,

02:43.917 --> 02:45.351
because I found out from Adrian

02:45.385 --> 02:46.886
that Ben was over here,
not from you.

02:46.920 --> 02:48.320
I said I was going to tell you.

02:48.355 --> 02:50.022
"If." You said "If."
What else did he say?

02:50.056 --> 02:51.690
Don't worry about it.
I already took care of it.

02:51.725 --> 02:53.192
What do you mean,
you took care of it?

02:53.226 --> 02:54.427
No, I am worried about it.

02:54.461 --> 02:56.128
He knows what Ben said,
but I don't know?

02:56.163 --> 02:58.130
How did you take care of it?
You don't want to know.

02:58.165 --> 03:00.232
I do want to know.
He was talking to me.

03:00.267 --> 03:02.701
I don't care
who he was talking to.
I want to know.

03:02.736 --> 03:03.869
I went to see Leo.

03:03.904 --> 03:05.371
I told him
in no uncertain terms

03:05.405 --> 03:07.606
that I want Ben
to apologize to you.
Why would you do that?

03:07.641 --> 03:09.475
Because no one says
the things that Ben said
to my daughter

03:09.509 --> 03:10.709
without my saying
something about it.

03:10.744 --> 03:12.344
Would someone tell me
what Ben said

03:12.379 --> 03:13.746
before I lose it here?

03:13.780 --> 03:15.114
If I tell you, you're really
going to lose it.

03:15.148 --> 03:16.982
That conversation
was between Ben and me.

03:17.017 --> 03:18.617
And me.
No, it wasn't.

03:18.652 --> 03:20.352
And I don't need you
to go over to Leo's

03:20.387 --> 03:22.788
and tell him to tell Ben
to apologize to me,

03:22.823 --> 03:24.423
and I don't need you to go
over to Adrian's

03:24.458 --> 03:25.925
and tell her
to apologize to me.

03:28.762 --> 03:30.729
You know how much
you love John?

03:30.764 --> 03:33.032
I love you
more than 17 times that much,

03:33.066 --> 03:35.034
and no one is going to treat
my little girl like that.

03:38.839 --> 03:40.673
Ben accused Amy
of faking her feelings for you

03:40.707 --> 03:42.708
so she wouldn't look bad
for having sex with you
at band camp.

03:42.742 --> 03:44.310
Are you kidding me?
He said that?

03:44.344 --> 03:45.644
Something like that.

03:45.679 --> 03:48.214
It's all so ridiculous,
I don't care. All right?

03:48.248 --> 03:50.716
Not all right.
I care. I love you.

03:50.750 --> 03:52.318
Yeah.

03:52.352 --> 03:53.719
You love a lot of girls.

03:59.993 --> 04:02.361
Where does Ben get the nerve
to say something like that?

04:02.395 --> 04:03.562
From his father.

04:03.597 --> 04:04.897
Leo basically blames
my little Amy

04:04.931 --> 04:06.098
for ruining Ben's life.

04:06.132 --> 04:07.433
Well, I guess to be fair,

04:07.467 --> 04:09.268
she did know she was pregnant
with my baby

04:09.302 --> 04:10.703
when she went out
with Ben the first time.

04:10.737 --> 04:11.704
So you agree with Leo?

04:11.738 --> 04:12.972
No, I don't agree with Leo.

04:13.006 --> 04:14.573
That doesn't even sound
like Mr. Boykewich.

04:14.608 --> 04:16.709
He actually said
Amy ruined Ben's life?

04:16.743 --> 04:19.043
Yep.
So he thinks Ben's life
is ruined?

04:19.079 --> 04:21.213
Apparently.
That doesn't make any sense.

04:21.248 --> 04:22.982
So what are you going to do?

04:23.016 --> 04:24.583
I'm going to take John
to the nursery.

04:24.618 --> 04:28.187
And then what?
I don't know what.

05:00.756 --> 05:02.657
I'd like to see Leo Boykewich.

05:02.691 --> 05:04.125
Oh, no one gets in to see
the king.

05:04.159 --> 05:05.393
All right.

05:05.427 --> 05:06.728
I'm just joking.

05:06.762 --> 05:08.296
He's not the Wizard of Oz.
He sees people.

05:08.330 --> 05:10.565
Did we forget
an appointment?
Uh, no.

05:10.599 --> 05:12.800
I'm Camiel.
I'm Leo's assistant.
You're Ricky, right?

05:12.835 --> 05:13.968
How do you know that?

05:14.003 --> 05:15.169
Are you kidding me?

05:15.204 --> 05:16.471
Leo talks about you
all the time.

05:16.505 --> 05:18.273
I knew who you were when you
stepped off the elevator.

05:18.307 --> 05:20.275
Plus he has a picture
of you and Ben

05:20.309 --> 05:21.910
working in the butcher shop
his desk.

05:21.944 --> 05:23.278
You're much more handsome
in person.

05:24.580 --> 05:26.114
He has a picture of me
on his desk?

05:26.148 --> 05:27.916
You and Ben, mm-hm.

05:27.950 --> 05:29.484
You want me to see
if I can reach him?

05:29.518 --> 05:30.718
He's probably
still in his car.

05:30.753 --> 05:32.553
No, no, that's okay.

05:32.588 --> 05:34.889
Could you do me a favor
and not mention this to him,

05:34.924 --> 05:36.124
that I dropped by?

05:36.158 --> 05:37.692
Leo would want to know
that you came by.

05:37.726 --> 05:38.960
I wanted to talk to him,

05:38.994 --> 05:41.763
but suddenly it seems
like it's a bad idea.

05:41.797 --> 05:43.131
Is there anything
I can help you with?

05:43.165 --> 05:44.766
No, I'm just an idiot.

05:44.800 --> 05:47.268
He already knows that,
so I'll just be going.

05:47.303 --> 05:48.970
I don't think
that you're an idiot,

05:49.004 --> 05:51.739
and I know that Leo has
a lot of respect for you.

05:51.774 --> 05:53.074
Sure you don't want to tell me
what's going on?

05:53.108 --> 05:54.943
No, it's personal,

05:54.977 --> 05:57.211
and...

05:57.246 --> 05:58.513
I just heard he said something

05:58.547 --> 06:00.481
that he couldn't possibly
have meant,

06:00.516 --> 06:01.649
something that would
really hurt someone,

06:01.684 --> 06:02.784
someone that I care about.

06:02.818 --> 06:05.687
Oh, dear.

06:05.721 --> 06:07.889
Well, listen.

06:07.923 --> 06:10.658
Leo is a really good man.

06:10.693 --> 06:12.393
I don't think he'd say
anything to hurt anybody,

06:12.428 --> 06:13.795
not intentionally anyway.

06:13.829 --> 06:15.964
No, he wouldn't.
I'm sure he wouldn't

06:15.998 --> 06:18.132
Thanks.
Sorry if I bothered you.

06:18.167 --> 06:21.069
No, no, not at all.
Tell Amy I said hi.

06:26.575 --> 06:30.011
Mr. Boykewich has
a picture of me on his desk?

06:30.045 --> 06:31.612
You and Ben.

06:31.647 --> 06:35.049
Oh, and another small one
of you and John
on the bookcase.

06:35.084 --> 06:38.353
You know, he's really hoping
that you're going to go
to college.

06:38.387 --> 06:39.654
He so wants you to do well.

06:39.688 --> 06:41.889
I mean, he just thinks
the world of you.

06:41.924 --> 06:44.225
You're like
a second son to him.

06:44.259 --> 06:46.227
Yeah, I don't know about that.

06:46.261 --> 06:48.296
Well, I do.

07:06.949 --> 07:08.449
Leo Boykewich,

07:08.484 --> 07:10.752
you get your butt over to
Amy's house right this minute

07:10.786 --> 07:12.653
and apologize
before something bad happens.

07:12.688 --> 07:15.490
Obviously George told
Amy what you said,
and she told Ricky.

07:15.524 --> 07:16.691
I can't talk to Amy.

07:16.725 --> 07:18.559
I don't know what she knows.

07:18.594 --> 07:20.128
I told you,
I'll go over later,

07:20.162 --> 07:21.429
and I'll apologize--

07:21.463 --> 07:23.331
N-No, uh-uh, not George.
Amy.

07:23.365 --> 07:25.299
Amy is the offended party here,
not George.

07:25.334 --> 07:28.369
How did I get into this?
Well, you opened your mouth
when you shouldn't have,

07:28.404 --> 07:29.637
which is not like you.

07:29.671 --> 07:31.572
Also not like you,
blaming other people

07:31.607 --> 07:33.975
or hiding in your office
from an 18-year-old

07:34.009 --> 07:35.543
who you love like your own son.

07:35.577 --> 07:39.313
I just said
some stupid, stupid things,

07:39.348 --> 07:40.948
and now I'm embarrassed.

07:40.983 --> 07:43.885
I was just so upset.
It just came out.

07:43.919 --> 07:46.387
Oh, it just came out.
Yes, it just came out.

07:46.422 --> 07:48.790
So you don't blame Amy at all
for what happened to Ben?

07:48.824 --> 07:50.892
No, I don't.
I love Amy.

07:52.494 --> 07:53.861
And I love Adrian.

07:55.397 --> 07:58.299
I do.
She's the mother
of my son's baby,

07:58.333 --> 07:59.634
and she's going to be his wife.

07:59.668 --> 08:00.768
I love Adrian.

08:00.803 --> 08:02.670
Okay, well, you keep telling
yourself that.

08:04.006 --> 08:05.873
I don't really like her
all that much.

08:05.908 --> 08:07.842
I know that,
but it's not your family.

08:07.876 --> 08:10.244
It's my family,
and I love Adrian,

08:10.279 --> 08:12.280
and so does my wife.

08:12.314 --> 08:13.748
Betty is very, very excited

08:13.782 --> 08:15.149
about all of this.

08:15.184 --> 08:16.884
And how are we feeling
about Betty today?

08:16.919 --> 08:18.519
I love Betty... every day.

08:18.554 --> 08:20.188
More some days than others.

08:20.222 --> 08:21.856
And how are we feeling
about me today?

08:21.890 --> 08:24.559
You? I don't like you
at all today.

08:24.593 --> 08:27.462
Oh, you like me.
You've liked me for 25 years.

08:28.697 --> 08:30.264
And because you like me,

08:30.299 --> 08:31.833
I am going to say this to you.

08:31.867 --> 08:33.835
You're under too much stress.
Okay?

08:33.869 --> 08:36.437
You're under too much stress,
and that's making you
say things to people

08:36.472 --> 08:38.806
that you don't mean to say,
and that's creating more stress,

08:38.841 --> 08:41.075
and the last thing you need
right now is more stress

08:41.110 --> 08:44.010
between Ben and Adrian
and the prenup

08:44.046 --> 08:46.581
and Betty and this new business
that you're taking on,

08:46.615 --> 08:48.883
you're-- you're going to snap,
Leo.

08:48.917 --> 08:51.085
You mark my words.
You are going to snap.

08:51.120 --> 08:52.653
Thanks for the warning, Camiel,

08:52.688 --> 08:53.855
but I already snapped.

08:58.560 --> 08:59.927
Why don't you walk Moose
over there?

08:59.962 --> 09:01.229
You can do that
for P.E. today.

09:01.263 --> 09:02.563
[groans]

09:02.598 --> 09:04.165
Why can't Amy ever walk Moose?

09:04.199 --> 09:05.666
Because Amy's not the one
who's home schooled

09:05.701 --> 09:06.934
and has a P.E. requirement.

09:09.638 --> 09:11.205
Still mad at me?

09:11.240 --> 09:13.007
[chuckles]
No.

09:14.042 --> 09:15.409
I'm not still mad at you.

09:17.112 --> 09:19.213
I'm sorry I got upset.

09:20.616 --> 09:22.717
And knowing
that you did what you did

09:22.751 --> 09:24.285
because you love me so much,

09:24.319 --> 09:26.821
really just made
all the bad things that people
have ever said to me

09:26.855 --> 09:28.389
just, um, disappear.

09:28.423 --> 09:29.457
What did he say?

09:31.026 --> 09:32.793
Did it start
with "abracadabra"?

09:32.828 --> 09:34.629
Maybe he's trying to make
you disappear.

09:34.663 --> 09:36.297
I just said something nice.

09:36.331 --> 09:38.499
You should try it sometime,
and you know why, actually?

09:38.534 --> 09:42.069
I don't want to know.
Because good begets good,
and bad begets bad.

09:42.104 --> 09:43.404
Are you quoting the Bible now?

09:43.438 --> 09:45.506
Yes-- "Episiotomy" 9:29.

09:47.075 --> 09:48.943
And today, Amy, I hope you're
going to do something good

09:48.977 --> 09:50.311
and get that shower
for Adrian going again.

09:50.345 --> 09:52.513
Oh, I don't know if I can do
something that good.

09:52.548 --> 09:54.982
You can do it.
I know you can do it.
I can do it, but--

09:55.017 --> 09:56.217
But it's the right thing to do,

09:56.251 --> 09:57.451
and you always do
the right thing.

09:57.486 --> 09:58.586
Are you kidding me?

10:02.257 --> 10:05.159
All right, I will try to make
the shower happen.

10:05.194 --> 10:07.628
Don't just try.
I don't want any repeats
of yesterday.

10:07.663 --> 10:09.597
All right, Dad.
[mocking]
"All right, Dad."

10:09.631 --> 10:11.332
What is going on with you two?

10:11.366 --> 10:13.701
Nothing.
Well, something--
something is going on.

10:13.735 --> 10:14.969
Something was going on,

10:15.003 --> 10:16.470
but we're fine,
Ashley and me.

10:16.505 --> 10:17.805
No, we're not.

10:17.839 --> 10:20.074
Okay, we're not.

10:21.443 --> 10:23.144
I'm sorry for what I said
to you last night.

10:26.014 --> 10:29.383
All right.
Well, if either of you come
across my English Lit book,

10:29.418 --> 10:30.551
I really need it.

10:31.653 --> 10:32.954
Have a nice day.

10:36.592 --> 10:37.892
[whines]

10:40.195 --> 10:41.429
What did she say to you?

10:41.463 --> 10:43.497
She said that I'm ugly.
What did you say to her?

10:43.532 --> 10:45.800
That she destroyed our family
by having a baby.

10:45.834 --> 10:47.401
Okay, well, you're not ugly,

10:47.436 --> 10:49.003
and she didn't destroy
our family by having a baby.

10:49.037 --> 10:50.905
Amy gets magic,
and I get that?

10:50.939 --> 10:53.774
Ashley,
you're a beautiful girl.

10:53.809 --> 10:56.477
You can't walk around looking
like that and not know tha

10:56.511 --> 10:57.945
and Amy didn't break
up our family.

10:57.980 --> 10:59.814
I broke up our family.
Who cares?

10:59.848 --> 11:02.083
What? What is getting you
so upset?

11:02.117 --> 11:03.451
I don't know.

11:03.485 --> 11:05.720
I'm just upset, okay?

11:05.754 --> 11:07.121
And angry and...

11:09.324 --> 11:11.392
about nothing and everything.

11:11.426 --> 11:15.296
Well, a lot has happened
that would make you
justifiably angry.

11:15.330 --> 11:16.964
On the other hand, you've kind
of been angry since birth.

11:16.999 --> 11:18.132
That's part of your charm.

11:18.166 --> 11:19.834
I'm not charming, okay?

11:21.670 --> 11:23.170
And I'm not pretty,

11:23.205 --> 11:24.639
and I'm not that smart,

11:24.673 --> 11:26.874
and no one likes me.

11:26.908 --> 11:28.743
I like you.
You don't even know me.

11:28.777 --> 11:31.679
Okay, tell me something
about yourself I don't know.

11:33.315 --> 11:34.982
I have Amy's English book.

11:37.653 --> 11:39.287
[whines]

11:44.126 --> 11:46.394
7:45, and I've failed
as a father.

11:51.449 --> 11:53.584
The magician said
to bring you your book.

11:53.618 --> 11:55.485
You had this?
Yeah, I had it.

11:55.520 --> 11:56.587
You left it
on the kitchen table.

11:56.621 --> 11:57.688
I was reading it.

11:57.722 --> 11:58.922
I didn't know you needed it.

11:58.957 --> 12:00.524
You had my book
and you didn't tell me?

12:00.558 --> 12:02.159
You sound upset.

12:02.193 --> 12:03.493
Did the magic spell wear off?

12:03.528 --> 12:05.195
I needed this book
to do my homework.

12:05.230 --> 12:06.263
I didn't do my homework

12:06.297 --> 12:07.664
because I didn't have
the book.

12:07.699 --> 12:09.800
Oh, you worry about
all the wrong things.
You know that?

12:09.834 --> 12:11.335
[British accent]
'Ello, mates.

12:12.403 --> 12:13.604
[normal voice]
I drove Ashley here.

12:13.638 --> 12:16.373
That was very nice of you,
Toby.

12:16.407 --> 12:17.975
You're a very nice guy.

12:18.009 --> 12:20.277
Hopefully Ashley can do
something nice for you
in return.

12:20.311 --> 12:23.280
Like...
Yeah, like what,
have sex with him?

12:23.314 --> 12:25.048
Why would you think
that I meant that?

12:25.083 --> 12:26.316
You want to have sex with him?

12:27.552 --> 12:29.419
Have sex with him.

12:29.454 --> 12:31.088
Thought you only wanted
to have sex with Ricky.

12:33.157 --> 12:34.925
Have sex with him.

12:34.959 --> 12:36.193
Much better idea.

12:36.227 --> 12:37.861
Just be sure to use a condom.

12:37.895 --> 12:39.730
It's just a mile and a half
over here,

12:39.764 --> 12:41.898
and your dad kind of made her
bring you your book.

12:42.967 --> 12:44.534
But thanks for the suggestion.

12:48.106 --> 12:51.074
Hey, we're really sorry
about yesterday.

12:51.109 --> 12:53.443
We're definitely coming
to the shower, and we're
going to bring presents.

12:53.478 --> 12:56.680
Why?
Because you're our friend,
our best friend.

12:58.316 --> 13:00.450
And Adrian actually
kind of overhear us

13:00.485 --> 13:02.085
talking in the hall
about how she's not nice,

13:02.120 --> 13:03.754
so now we kind of have to.

13:03.788 --> 13:05.789
Yeah, we feel really bad
about that.

13:05.823 --> 13:10.994
Actually I feel badly
about some of the things
I said to Adrian, too.

13:11.029 --> 13:12.696
I guess I better find her
and apologize.

13:12.730 --> 13:13.897
Yeah, you should do that.

13:13.931 --> 13:15.532
You should.
I'm going to...

13:15.566 --> 13:16.733
right after I call Grace

13:16.768 --> 13:18.669
to make sure she still wants
out of the shower

13:18.703 --> 13:20.637
because there's no sense
in apologizing

13:20.672 --> 13:23.173
if it's already been decided
that there is no shower.

13:23.207 --> 13:24.841
I think her mom
is kind of insisting

13:24.876 --> 13:26.476
that you two still give Adrian
a shower.

13:26.511 --> 13:29.413
Oh, I didn't know.

13:29.447 --> 13:32.349
My parents were very busy
getting involved
in our lives yesterday.

13:32.383 --> 13:35.552
Your parents?
Ben came over to my house last
night and told me off,

13:35.586 --> 13:38.322
and then my dad went
over to Ben's house
and told Leo off

13:38.356 --> 13:40.524
and demanded
that Ben apologize to me.

13:40.558 --> 13:41.925
[chuckles]

13:41.959 --> 13:43.193
Yeah.

13:43.227 --> 13:45.562
And what did Mr. Boykewich say

13:45.596 --> 13:46.930
when you dad told him off?

13:46.964 --> 13:49.666
I guess he said that Ben
would apologize to me.

13:49.701 --> 13:51.902
Did you tell Ben off
after he told you off?

13:51.936 --> 13:55.038
Well, I-- I guess
I might have said some things

13:55.073 --> 13:56.306
that I shouldn't have said.

14:03.948 --> 14:06.450
I guess
he's not going to apapologi.

14:06.484 --> 14:08.151
[sighs]

14:08.186 --> 14:09.419
At least not now, anyway.

14:09.454 --> 14:11.188
No, guess not.

14:11.222 --> 14:14.157
Whatever. My dad told me
I have to apologize to Adrian,

14:14.192 --> 14:18.995
so I will apologize
to Adrian... eventually.

14:19.030 --> 14:20.731
I'm going to call Grace.

14:25.403 --> 14:27.003
<i>[rings]</i>

14:27.038 --> 14:30.807
Hi, Amy,
I can't talk right now.
I'm late for school, obviously.

14:30.842 --> 14:33.009
Okay, well, I just wanted
to let you know

14:33.044 --> 14:34.878
that Madison and Lauren
came to me

14:34.912 --> 14:36.646
and said that they
want to go to the shower,

14:36.681 --> 14:38.682
um, if that's okay
with you and Adrian

14:38.716 --> 14:41.318
and if we're still going
to have the shower.

14:41.352 --> 14:43.086
[sniffles]
We have to have the shower.

14:43.121 --> 14:44.054
You okay?

14:44.088 --> 14:46.089
No, I'm not okay, but...

14:46.124 --> 14:47.591
I have to go.
I can't talk right now.

14:50.895 --> 14:52.162
She sounded upset,

14:52.230 --> 14:53.630
like really upset.

14:53.664 --> 14:55.766
I know what that's about.

15:02.306 --> 15:03.807
This belongs to my son.

15:03.841 --> 15:05.308
You've been reading my texts?

15:05.343 --> 15:07.544
I can get away with things
at this age.

15:10.114 --> 15:13.583
Also at my age, I like to sit.

15:21.492 --> 15:22.926
Don't apologize to Grant.

15:22.960 --> 15:24.528
You don't have anything
to apologize for.

15:25.797 --> 15:26.997
You let him come to you.

15:27.031 --> 15:31.435
You let him apologize to you
for acting like that.

15:31.469 --> 15:33.770
You weren't doing
anything wrong, were you?

15:33.805 --> 15:34.971
No.

15:35.006 --> 15:37.240
Maybe I should just tell him
how much he means to me

15:37.275 --> 15:40.043
and how nice he is.

15:40.077 --> 15:42.512
I don't know.

15:42.547 --> 15:45.248
I'm just so afraid
of losing him.

15:45.283 --> 15:47.651
[sighs]
I'm glad I have a boy.

15:47.685 --> 15:49.352
I can't stand the tears.

15:49.387 --> 15:52.389
Buck up, sweetheart.
You're not going to lose him.

15:52.423 --> 15:55.125
He-- [laughing]
The guy's in love with you.

15:55.159 --> 15:57.093
Yeah, but--
But nothing.

15:57.128 --> 15:58.995
Don't you see?
He should've declared his--

15:59.030 --> 16:03.600
his-- his turf,
defended his territory.

16:03.634 --> 16:05.435
You're worth defending,
cookie.

16:05.470 --> 16:06.937
"Cookie"?

16:06.971 --> 16:08.171
Like a sugar cookie,

16:08.206 --> 16:09.873
sweet and sparkly.

16:09.907 --> 16:12.442
I never had a nickname before.
You got one now.

16:12.477 --> 16:14.978
I don't deserve
a nickname like that.

16:15.012 --> 16:16.346
I'm not that sweet.

16:16.380 --> 16:17.914
I'm a terrible girlfriend.

16:17.949 --> 16:20.784
I'm-- I'm a terrible daughter.

16:20.818 --> 16:22.853
I'm a terrible sister.
I'm a terrible friend.

16:22.887 --> 16:25.021
I'm not a shrink, cookie.

16:25.056 --> 16:27.090
I'm afraid all I can help you
with is Grant.

16:28.659 --> 16:31.127
That's all I really want
to help you with.

16:31.162 --> 16:32.496
You're very emotional.

16:32.530 --> 16:33.497
[whimpering]
I know.

16:33.531 --> 16:35.332
All right.

16:35.366 --> 16:38.835
Well, if you ever need
to talk about Grant again,

16:38.870 --> 16:41.137
you just call me.

16:41.172 --> 16:44.374
Yeah, I know,
you'll call Jack's dad.

16:44.408 --> 16:47.544
But I'm not the jealous type.

16:47.578 --> 16:50.547
I just think you're good
for my boy, you know?

16:51.983 --> 16:54.718
But I want him to be good
for you,

16:54.752 --> 16:56.786
so you hang in there
and play it smart

16:56.821 --> 16:58.154
because you're a winner.

17:00.024 --> 17:02.759
We're going to be friends
for a long time, Cookie.

17:02.793 --> 17:03.994
I hope so.

17:04.028 --> 17:06.530
Then it's a grand slam
for Foeburg.

17:09.634 --> 17:11.268
Out of the park.

17:14.805 --> 17:16.239
Thanks for coming.

17:21.507 --> 17:25.410
<i>She said that to you,
that I had sex with you,</i>

17:25.444 --> 17:27.244
that I got pregnant,
and I'm marrying you

17:27.280 --> 17:29.348
just to get back at Ricky?

17:29.382 --> 17:31.149
Why didn't you tell me this
last night?

17:31.184 --> 17:33.418
Because it was late,
and you really need your sleep.

17:33.453 --> 17:35.387
I can't believe I was going
to apologize to her
for yesterday

17:35.421 --> 17:36.888
when she said that to you.

17:36.923 --> 17:40.225
Yeah, well, she also sent
her dad over to tell my dad

17:40.259 --> 17:42.260
to tell me to apologize to her.

17:42.295 --> 17:44.162
What? And what did
your dad say?

17:44.197 --> 17:46.164
He yelled at me
for what I said to Amy,

17:46.199 --> 17:47.466
and he told me to apologize,

17:47.500 --> 17:48.934
and at some point

17:48.968 --> 17:50.635
I guess I have to apologize.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.137
What about what she said
to you?

17:52.171 --> 17:54.106
Yeah, well...

17:54.140 --> 17:55.307
Look, there's Grace.

17:55.341 --> 17:57.209
I'll let you two talk.
Hi, Grace.

18:01.180 --> 18:03.281
Hi, Adrian.

18:03.316 --> 18:04.783
We really do need to talk.

18:04.817 --> 18:08.453
I'm really sorry
about what happened yesterday,
and so is Amy.

18:08.488 --> 18:10.188
We still really want to throw
the shower for you,

18:10.223 --> 18:12.157
and Amy said that Madison
and Lauren want to come,

18:12.191 --> 18:13.825
and I'm sure plenty
of other girls do, too.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.894
No, no shower.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.430
No Amy, no Lauren, no Madison.

18:18.464 --> 18:19.664
Just you and me.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.533
We'll have lunch.
That's the shower.

18:21.567 --> 18:23.735
But Amy made the reservation
at the restaurant.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.904
She put down,
like, $200 at Jeff's.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.973
Good. We'll have steak
and lobster.

18:28.007 --> 18:30.308
I thought you said you couldn't
have shellfish at this stage
of your pregnancy?

18:30.343 --> 18:32.244
It doesn't mean
I can't order it,
a whole lot of it.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.912
Adrian, you wouldn't even be
getting back at Amy.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.113
You'd be getting back
at George.

18:35.148 --> 18:36.381
He gave her the money.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.150
Even better.

18:38.184 --> 18:40.419
After what George and Amy
said to Leo and Ben,

18:40.453 --> 18:42.354
they deserve to lose $200,

18:42.388 --> 18:43.622
and they're getting off cheap,

18:43.656 --> 18:45.090
and you can tell them that,
both of them.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.225
Can we not do this, please?

18:47.260 --> 18:48.727
I was having
a really good morning.

18:48.761 --> 18:51.096
I got a nickname
from Grant's dad.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.330
"Cookie."

18:52.365 --> 18:54.633
Well, there's no shower,
Cookie.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.601
Just you and me.

18:57.937 --> 19:00.439
Adrian, wait.

19:00.473 --> 19:04.042
Amy, don't--
don't even try to talk to her.

19:04.076 --> 19:06.545
I can't believe
I almost apologized to you,

19:06.579 --> 19:08.880
and I tried to get Ben
to apologize to you.

19:08.915 --> 19:13.185
So what? I almost apologized
to you and to Ben.

19:13.219 --> 19:14.953
Almost only counts
in horseshoes,

19:14.987 --> 19:17.989
so why don't you guys apologize
right now, to each other

19:18.024 --> 19:19.391
really apologize?

19:19.425 --> 19:20.625
Shut up, Cookie.

19:21.694 --> 19:24.529
Okay, what did I do now?
Hm?

19:24.564 --> 19:26.231
What did I say?

19:26.265 --> 19:27.432
And who's Cookie?

19:28.734 --> 19:31.269
Okay, look, I don't know
what's going on here,

19:31.304 --> 19:33.038
but I just wanted
to work things out

19:33.072 --> 19:34.439
so that we can have
the shower for you.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.107
Well, I don't want
to work things out,

19:36.142 --> 19:38.810
and I don't want an apology
from you, you big fake.

19:38.845 --> 19:39.978
I don't want a shower.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.480
Fine.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.181
Then we won't work things out.

19:43.216 --> 19:45.217
I won't apologize to you.

19:45.251 --> 19:47.986
I didn't want to apologize
to you anyway,

19:48.020 --> 19:50.188
and nobody wanted to come
to your shower.

19:50.223 --> 19:52.324
That's how we got into all this
in the first place.

19:52.358 --> 19:54.459
Adrian, remember,
Adrian's having a baby.

19:54.494 --> 19:58.129
I know that, okay?
I know that she's having
a baby,

19:58.164 --> 20:00.799
but she's not the only one
who's going through something.

20:00.833 --> 20:03.401
I'm going through something,
too, okay?

20:03.436 --> 20:04.669
I had a baby,

20:04.704 --> 20:06.104
I am a mother,

20:06.138 --> 20:07.973
and I have to work
after school,

20:08.007 --> 20:09.474
and I don't have time
to do my homework

20:09.509 --> 20:11.209
or to take care of my son John

20:11.244 --> 20:13.144
or to have a relationship
with his father...

20:14.947 --> 20:16.748
who half of you
have slept with.

20:16.782 --> 20:19.050
And, by the way,
he doesn't love you, okay?

20:19.085 --> 20:21.253
He loves me.
I-- I don't care
what he told you.

20:21.287 --> 20:22.687
[inaudible]

20:24.390 --> 20:27.325
Not that we even have
a chance at being happy...

20:27.360 --> 20:30.228
because no one in my family
is happy.

20:30.263 --> 20:32.931
That's why my parents
are divorced,

20:32.965 --> 20:34.332
that and I had a baby.

20:35.535 --> 20:36.868
And bonus?

20:36.903 --> 20:39.004
I am failing English.

20:39.038 --> 20:40.171
I (ave never failed before...

20:40.206 --> 20:41.506
ever.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.141
Yeah, I got incompletes
when John was born,

20:43.175 --> 20:45.277
but I have never failed.

20:45.311 --> 20:47.112
I'm failing.

20:47.146 --> 20:49.180
[sighs]

20:49.215 --> 20:50.448
I'm overwhelmed.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.618
You have no idea what it's like

20:53.653 --> 20:55.487
to be a teenage mother.

20:55.521 --> 20:57.822
It stinks.
Okay?

20:57.857 --> 20:59.224
No matter how much you love
the kid,

20:59.258 --> 21:01.126
it stinks.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.761
You just wait and see, Adrian.

21:02.795 --> 21:04.629
It is not easy to be a mother
in high school.

21:04.664 --> 21:06.531
I know that.

21:06.566 --> 21:08.800
I know it's not easy.

21:08.834 --> 21:11.369
You know how I know
it's not easy?

21:11.404 --> 21:14.039
My mother was a teenage mother.

21:15.908 --> 21:17.409
I've been there.

21:17.443 --> 21:20.045
I've lived it.

21:20.079 --> 21:22.881
Do you have any idea
how I feel,

21:22.915 --> 21:26.184
how I have felt my whole life?

21:26.218 --> 21:27.986
I never had anything.

21:28.020 --> 21:30.055
I never had
what other girls had.

21:30.089 --> 21:31.590
I never had a father

21:31.624 --> 21:34.826
until I went out
and I tracked him down,

21:34.860 --> 21:36.528
and then when he married
my mother,

21:36.562 --> 21:37.796
what did I do?

21:37.830 --> 21:39.130
I disappointed them both

21:39.165 --> 21:41.366
by doing just what they did.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.603
I hate myself.

21:44.637 --> 21:47.939
A lot of days I hate myself,

21:47.974 --> 21:49.240
but I get up,

21:49.275 --> 21:50.542
and I come to school,

21:50.576 --> 21:53.278
and I try to forget
that I hate myself

21:53.312 --> 21:55.313
because I don't want anyone
to know,

21:55.348 --> 21:57.549
and I don't want my baby
to feel that,

21:57.583 --> 21:59.484
to feel that hate

21:59.518 --> 22:00.986
and that insecurity

22:01.020 --> 22:04.689
and that awful feeling of
not being like everyone else.

22:05.925 --> 22:08.159
Do you know how hard
I've worked

22:08.194 --> 22:10.795
to get to a place
where I like myself?

22:12.131 --> 22:16.501
To have just an ounce--
an ounce of self-esteem?

22:16.535 --> 22:18.303
Huh? Do you?

22:20.006 --> 22:22.273
I'm sexy. Yeah.

22:22.308 --> 22:24.175
That was a gift.

22:24.210 --> 22:27.879
But I had to work
on my self-esteem.

22:27.913 --> 22:30.682
And you? You're lucky.

22:30.716 --> 22:33.451
You had two best friends
by your side

22:33.486 --> 22:34.919
all the way through school.

22:34.954 --> 22:36.488
I didn't have any friends.

22:36.522 --> 22:37.989
I don't have any friends.

22:38.024 --> 22:38.990
[clears throat]

22:39.025 --> 22:40.458
Except for Cookie.

22:41.694 --> 22:43.128
Do you know what?

22:43.162 --> 22:46.097
Who's idea was it to have
this stupid shower anyway?

22:46.132 --> 22:47.132
Yours.

22:47.166 --> 22:49.300
[class bell rings]

22:57.309 --> 23:01.513
Look, we've all said things
that we shouldn't have said,

23:01.547 --> 23:04.182
so let me just be
the first one to apologize.

23:05.518 --> 23:08.119
I apologize, Amy.

23:08.154 --> 23:11.556
[sighs]
And I apologize to you
for not staying out of it.

23:11.590 --> 23:12.924
I just made it worse.

23:17.163 --> 23:20.231
Okay, I guess I'll be
the only one to apologize.

23:20.266 --> 23:24.703
Look, let me add that Adrian
really wanted this shower,

23:24.737 --> 23:27.605
and I wanted it for her.

23:27.640 --> 23:30.608
And maybe she shouldn't
have invited all the girls
that Ricky slept with,

23:30.643 --> 23:34.379
but it wasn't malicious.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.847
It was thoughtless maybe.

23:35.881 --> 23:40.151
Sorry, Adrian, but...
it wasn't malicious, Amy.

23:40.186 --> 23:42.987
Besides, you already knew
that Ricky had slept
with all those girls.

23:43.022 --> 23:45.557
He's Ricky.
He's the bad boy.

23:45.591 --> 23:48.193
It's just what he does.

23:48.227 --> 23:50.028
He's the guy
that all the girls want,

23:50.062 --> 23:51.362
but you got him.

23:55.034 --> 23:56.568
Okay, Amy?

23:56.602 --> 23:59.137
You got him,

23:59.171 --> 24:00.472
and Adrian got me,

24:00.506 --> 24:01.873
and we've all got each other,

24:01.907 --> 24:04.943
so please, let's just all
try to get along

24:04.977 --> 24:07.412
before any of us get
emotionally naked again

24:07.446 --> 24:09.547
in the school hallway.

24:10.683 --> 24:12.317
You're idiots.
You know that?

24:12.351 --> 24:13.718
You're all idiots.

24:13.753 --> 24:14.753
Me, too?

24:14.787 --> 24:16.154
Don't you get it?

24:16.188 --> 24:18.990
Don't any of you get it?

24:19.024 --> 24:20.592
I'm not e bad boy.

24:20.626 --> 24:22.393
I'm damaged goods.

24:22.428 --> 24:24.729
And I've worked
for half my life

24:24.764 --> 24:26.364
to try to get over
what happened to me.

24:27.733 --> 24:30.735
Having indiscriminant sex
is not a happy thing,

24:30.770 --> 24:32.871
for me or for any abused kid

24:32.905 --> 24:35.240
who's trying to heal.

24:35.274 --> 24:37.909
I'm trying to heal
for my life, okay?

24:39.512 --> 24:41.546
And it was embarrassing to me

24:41.580 --> 24:43.715
that you called
all those girls over, Adrian.

24:45.117 --> 24:46.851
And it was embarrassing to me

24:46.886 --> 24:48.987
that you saw them
as competition, Amy,

24:49.021 --> 24:51.523
like I'm some kind of prize
that girls are fighting over.

24:53.225 --> 24:55.260
I hurt them, okay?

24:55.294 --> 24:57.595
I... hurt them,

24:57.630 --> 24:59.330
and I'm embarrassed by that.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.634
I'm embarrassed
by this whole thing.

25:03.936 --> 25:07.172
All because
of this stupid shower.

25:15.834 --> 25:18.870
She's always gotten
more attention than I have.

25:18.904 --> 25:20.771
Back in the old days,
when she was good,

25:20.806 --> 25:22.473
she got more attention
for being good,

25:22.508 --> 25:24.642
and then she was bad,

25:24.676 --> 25:28.012
and she got even
more attention for being bad.

25:28.046 --> 25:29.580
And she's still getting
more attention.

25:31.149 --> 25:33.718
My dad and I used to be
really close,

25:33.752 --> 25:36.287
but now he's just as close
to Amy.

25:36.321 --> 25:38.990
Yeah, but she and your mother
used to be really close,

25:39.024 --> 25:40.491
and now you're just
as close to her, right?

25:40.526 --> 25:41.893
I'm going to quit talking
to you

25:41.927 --> 25:43.361
if you keep repeating
stuff I've said

25:43.395 --> 25:44.428
back to me
at the wrong time.

25:44.463 --> 25:46.631
Sorry.

25:46.665 --> 25:47.965
Where were we?

25:49.968 --> 25:52.003
I should be used
to being invisible by now.

25:53.639 --> 25:55.273
But I'm not.

25:55.307 --> 25:57.174
I know something that
would get your dad's attention.

25:57.209 --> 25:59.510
Oh, duh, let me see.

25:59.545 --> 26:00.745
If I had sex with you?

26:00.779 --> 26:03.281
It's weird.
It's like you're psychic.

26:03.315 --> 26:05.116
You know my every thought.

26:05.150 --> 26:07.952
That's because every thought
is the same.

26:07.986 --> 26:10.087
Don't you ever think
about anything but sex?

26:10.122 --> 26:12.223
Well...

26:12.257 --> 26:13.391
not really, no.

26:14.927 --> 26:16.360
I had sex a couple times,

26:16.395 --> 26:18.829
but it wasn't that good.

26:18.864 --> 26:21.198
The first girl
cried a lot afterward,

26:21.233 --> 26:22.800
and then she told her mother,

26:22.834 --> 26:24.268
and then her mother
told my mother,

26:24.303 --> 26:25.770
and then I got
into a lot of trouble

26:25.804 --> 26:27.672
even though it was her idea
in the first place.

26:29.041 --> 26:30.708
And the second girl
kept yelling,

26:30.742 --> 26:33.244
"Not like that!"

26:33.278 --> 26:35.146
And then I cried.

26:35.180 --> 26:36.881
Not in front of her,
but when I got home.

26:36.915 --> 26:38.549
Is that supposed to make me
want to do it?

26:38.584 --> 26:40.117
Couldn't we just do it
one time,

26:40.152 --> 26:41.986
just agree that it would be
this one time,

26:42.020 --> 26:44.488
and then we'd never
have to do it again?

26:44.523 --> 26:47.124
I just want one normal
sexual experience.

26:47.159 --> 26:48.492
Well, I'm not normal,

26:48.527 --> 26:50.428
so I doubt sex with me
would be normal.

26:50.462 --> 26:52.229
In your case,
I'll take "not normal."

26:52.264 --> 26:53.598
I'd be willing to risk it.

26:53.632 --> 26:55.433
I'm serious.
I'm not normal.

26:56.969 --> 26:59.236
And I couldn't guarantee what
the results are going to be.

27:00.505 --> 27:01.839
And you know I'm angry,

27:01.873 --> 27:03.074
and I'm critical.

27:03.108 --> 27:05.142
Yeah.

27:05.177 --> 27:06.477
I'd still be willing
to risk it.

27:06.511 --> 27:07.945
I'm not having sex with you.

27:07.980 --> 27:10.147
All right.

27:10.182 --> 27:11.916
Then I'll settle for you
saying something nice to me.

27:11.950 --> 27:13.751
You say something
nice to me first.

27:13.785 --> 27:15.219
You're prettier
than your sister.

27:15.253 --> 27:17.655
All right,
I'll have sex with you.

27:17.689 --> 27:18.723
Really?

27:18.757 --> 27:20.291
No.

27:24.196 --> 27:26.430
Some girl actually said,
"Not like that"?

27:26.465 --> 27:28.599
Does my pain amuse you?

27:28.634 --> 27:30.801
Yeah, it does.

27:30.836 --> 27:33.337
Maybe we could be friends.

27:33.372 --> 27:34.572
Or more than friends.

27:34.606 --> 27:35.573
Maybe.

27:40.312 --> 27:41.712
Before you say anything...

27:43.882 --> 27:47.385
I was a complete ass,
and I'm sorry.

27:47.419 --> 27:48.419
You don't owe me an apology.

27:48.453 --> 27:50.121
You owe Alice an apology.

27:50.155 --> 27:51.856
I know.
I was looking for
the two of you at school.

27:51.890 --> 27:55.159
We weren't at school today.
Oh, why weren't you
at school today?

27:55.193 --> 27:57.828
Because of what you said
to Alice.

27:57.863 --> 27:59.697
Her mother said we could take
a mental health day,

27:59.731 --> 28:01.198
so we did.

28:01.233 --> 28:03.501
Of course,
her mother and her father
went to work,

28:03.535 --> 28:06.470
so we pretty much just hung out
around the house having sex.

28:06.505 --> 28:08.205
I think she feels a lot better.

28:08.240 --> 28:09.940
I mean, she's hurt,
but she's better.

28:09.975 --> 28:11.208
Really?

28:11.243 --> 28:13.044
Because I'm finding
that sex with Adrian

28:13.078 --> 28:15.079
is pretty much wrecking
my mental health.

28:15.113 --> 28:17.014
Look, I was going to call
Alice last night,

28:17.049 --> 28:18.949
but I was too busy
getting yelled at.

28:18.984 --> 28:20.718
Someone should yell at you.

28:20.752 --> 28:22.286
In your attempt to defend
your woman,

28:22.320 --> 28:23.888
you offended my woman,
and me.

28:23.922 --> 28:25.022
I know, I know.
I'm sorry.

28:25.057 --> 28:26.757
Look, go over to Alice's
with me.

28:26.792 --> 28:29.193
I want to talk to her.

28:29.227 --> 28:31.662
Now might not be
the best time.

28:31.697 --> 28:33.397
Her uncles are over there,

28:33.432 --> 28:35.733
discussing what you said to her.

28:37.169 --> 28:38.369
Yakuza.

28:38.403 --> 28:39.970
"Yakuza"?

28:40.005 --> 28:42.306
Ya-kuza.

28:43.375 --> 28:44.642
Japanese mobsters.

28:44.676 --> 28:46.911
Alice's uncles?

28:46.945 --> 28:48.813
No. Did I scare you?

28:48.847 --> 28:50.314
No.

28:50.348 --> 28:52.349
I know Alice wouldn't let
anyone do anything bad to me.

28:52.384 --> 28:53.784
I know Alice.

28:53.819 --> 28:55.252
She loves both of us,

28:55.287 --> 28:57.755
and I love both of you.

28:59.224 --> 29:00.324
You're my best friends,

29:00.358 --> 29:02.259
and it really kills me

29:02.294 --> 29:04.128
when I think
of what I said to her...

29:04.162 --> 29:05.529
and that I hurt her.

29:06.732 --> 29:07.865
She's in the closet,
you know.

29:07.899 --> 29:10.534
What? Alice is gay?

29:10.569 --> 29:12.703
No. She's in your closet.

29:21.813 --> 29:23.280
I'm sorry.

29:24.683 --> 29:26.083
I'm really sorry.

29:27.119 --> 29:28.853
All right, I'm sorry, too.

29:28.887 --> 29:30.087
I love you, Ben.

29:36.128 --> 29:37.561
All right, that's enough.

29:52.744 --> 29:52.777
Are those cookies, Cookie?

29:54.412 --> 29:55.946
[chuckles]
Yes.

29:55.981 --> 29:57.815
Isn't it funny that your dad
gave me that nickname

29:57.849 --> 29:59.116
and I bake cookies
all the time

29:59.151 --> 30:00.518
and he doesn't even know?

30:00.552 --> 30:01.786
Did you want one?

30:01.820 --> 30:04.088
I feel too humiliated to eat.

30:04.122 --> 30:06.724
I owe you an apology
for the way I acted last night.

30:06.758 --> 30:08.292
Whatever's going on
with you and Jack

30:08.326 --> 30:09.660
was between you and Jack

30:09.694 --> 30:11.595
and in no way threatens me
or our relationship,

30:11.630 --> 30:13.531
except for the fact that
I acted like a little kid

30:13.565 --> 30:14.698
and ran from the room.

30:14.733 --> 30:16.200
That might threaten
our relationship.

30:17.669 --> 30:20.104
Does that threaten
our relationship?

30:20.138 --> 30:21.505
No.

30:21.540 --> 30:24.041
Sometimes people just do
stupid things

30:24.075 --> 30:25.576
or say stupid things.

30:25.610 --> 30:28.412
I myself have have said
and done many stupid things.

30:30.215 --> 30:31.248
I love you.

30:31.283 --> 30:32.483
I love you, too.

30:32.517 --> 30:33.884
I love your dad.

30:33.919 --> 30:35.152
And he loves you, Cookie.

30:35.187 --> 30:36.253
[chuckles]

30:41.426 --> 30:43.894
I understand,
and I hope you understand

30:43.929 --> 30:46.030
that I'm under
a lot of pressure, too.

30:46.064 --> 30:47.398
Anne and I
are still trying to figure out

30:47.432 --> 30:49.300
how to handle things
now that we're divorced,

30:49.334 --> 30:53.204
and, obviously, I'm failing
miserably as a single parent.

30:53.238 --> 30:55.639
I was a single parent
for a long time.

30:55.674 --> 30:57.408
It's not easy.

31:02.447 --> 31:04.181
Uh...

31:05.450 --> 31:08.552
Hi. Um, am I interrupting
something?

31:09.955 --> 31:11.155
Come here, John.

31:13.258 --> 31:14.859
Uncle Leo wants to talk
to Amy.

31:25.070 --> 31:27.171
I'm really sorry
about what I said to Ben.

31:28.273 --> 31:33.410
Yeah, well, you can tell
that to Ben, then.

31:33.445 --> 31:34.979
This isn't about that.

31:35.013 --> 31:37.348
I said something
to your father
about you last night

31:37.382 --> 31:38.449
that I didn't mean,

31:38.483 --> 31:41.385
and I need to apologize to you.

31:41.419 --> 31:43.120
It's okay, Mr. Boykewich.

31:43.154 --> 31:44.822
I don't really know why,
but it's okay.

31:44.856 --> 31:46.690
It's really not okay.

31:46.725 --> 31:48.459
I don't want to say
something that'll hurt you,

31:48.493 --> 31:50.394
but someone might tell you
what I said,

31:50.428 --> 31:53.297
and I'd rather you hear
it from me.

31:53.331 --> 31:56.800
In a moment of anger
that I'm not proud of,

31:56.835 --> 31:59.637
I blamed you
for ruining Ben's life.

32:02.507 --> 32:05.709
Well, I understand
why you might do that.

32:05.744 --> 32:07.077
I don't really blame you,

32:07.112 --> 32:09.146
and I don't really think
his life is ruined.

32:09.180 --> 32:12.616
I mean, if his life
is ruined for having a baby
in high school,

32:12.651 --> 32:14.785
then I suppose
your life is ruined,

32:14.819 --> 32:16.820
and, obviously,
your life is not ruined.

32:18.423 --> 32:20.324
I've seen you
with John and Ricky.

32:20.358 --> 32:22.126
You're a strong young woman,

32:22.160 --> 32:24.328
all the stronger for everything
you've been through.

32:26.598 --> 32:28.332
It's just painful

32:28.366 --> 32:29.867
to watch Ben and Adrian know

32:29.901 --> 32:31.602
that they're going to go
through that pain, too.

32:33.038 --> 32:35.673
It's hard on a parent.

32:35.707 --> 32:36.907
I love my son.

32:36.942 --> 32:38.542
Yeah.

32:40.679 --> 32:42.513
It's kind of like
the way I love John,

32:42.547 --> 32:44.748
just 17 years times that.

32:44.783 --> 32:46.283
Yeah, like that.

32:47.385 --> 32:48.953
And I guess your dad

32:48.987 --> 32:51.055
told Ricky
what I said you, today,

32:51.089 --> 32:53.257
and he came down to my office
to confront me.

32:53.291 --> 32:54.458
Ricky did?

32:54.492 --> 32:56.226
Yes, he did,

32:56.261 --> 32:58.028
and I hid from him.

32:58.063 --> 32:59.997
I was so embarrassed,
I hid from him.

33:00.031 --> 33:01.665
I mean, me hiding from Ricky.

33:01.700 --> 33:05.035
Yeah, I know the feeling.

33:05.070 --> 33:07.604
Think I might be doing
that for a while. [chuckles]

33:10.475 --> 33:11.742
[sighs]

33:16.721 --> 33:19.023
<i>[man chattering on TV]</i>

33:21.927 --> 33:24.295
I brought cookies for you guys.

33:27.065 --> 33:29.099
Is anyone speaking to me?

33:29.134 --> 33:30.668
No.

33:31.770 --> 33:33.037
I'm speaking to you.

33:33.071 --> 33:34.872
We just don't want cookies
you baked for Grant.

33:34.906 --> 33:36.540
No, I think we do.

33:36.575 --> 33:37.708
[clicks off TV]

33:37.742 --> 33:40.377
Of course you do.

33:40.412 --> 33:42.513
I'm really sorry
that I yelled at you, Tom.

33:43.682 --> 33:44.882
I should've known
that your old girlfriend

33:44.916 --> 33:46.283
wouldn't want to go
to Adrian's shower

33:46.318 --> 33:48.285
knowing how you feel
about Adrian.

33:48.320 --> 33:50.521
And even though Tammy's married
to somebody else,

33:50.555 --> 33:51.789
she was your first love,

33:51.823 --> 33:53.057
and I'm sure you'll both

33:53.091 --> 33:54.725
always have a place
in your hearts for each other.

33:54.759 --> 33:55.893
You got that right.

33:55.927 --> 33:57.261
I love you, Tom.

33:57.295 --> 33:58.529
You know I love you,

33:58.563 --> 34:00.130
and I'll help you find
someone to go out with.

34:00.165 --> 34:01.265
I promise.

34:01.299 --> 34:03.267
Uh... no.

34:03.301 --> 34:04.969
Thanks, sis,

34:05.003 --> 34:06.971
but I love you, too.

34:07.005 --> 34:09.806
Thanks for the cookies.
You're welcome.

34:09.841 --> 34:11.876
Say "Thanks for the cookies."

34:11.909 --> 34:13.643
Do you mind if I talk
to Grace alone?

34:13.678 --> 34:16.013
Go ahead.

34:21.018 --> 34:24.154
I take complete responsibility
for messing things up with us.

34:24.188 --> 34:26.290
No, you can't take
complete responsibility.

34:26.324 --> 34:27.558
I made mistakes, too,

34:27.592 --> 34:30.127
not the same type
of mistakes you made,

34:30.161 --> 34:32.096
but I made mistakes.

34:32.130 --> 34:34.965
And hey, we tried it,
we gave it a shot,

34:35.000 --> 34:36.833
and it just didn't work out.

34:36.868 --> 34:38.668
I feel like a big wuss
for saying this,

34:38.703 --> 34:40.536
but I don't think
I've got the guts

34:40.572 --> 34:43.040
to really try it again,
with Madison.

34:43.074 --> 34:44.574
I keep running back to you

34:44.609 --> 34:46.944
because I think
it would be better
to mess things up with you

34:46.978 --> 34:48.812
than to mess things up
with Madison.

34:48.847 --> 34:51.415
You don't really have
a choice, I guess.

34:51.449 --> 34:53.516
Yeah, I guess I don't.

34:53.551 --> 34:56.186
But I don't think you'll
mess things up with Madison.

34:56.221 --> 34:58.255
I don't think you'll cheat
on her or anything.

34:58.290 --> 35:01.258
And you're a good guy.
You've always been a good guy.

35:01.293 --> 35:02.259
Thanks.

35:02.294 --> 35:03.460
Sure.

35:04.496 --> 35:06.830
Bye.
Bye.

35:10.368 --> 35:11.335
I'll see you around the house?

35:11.369 --> 35:12.569
Yep.

35:20.278 --> 35:21.712
[knock on door]

35:23.615 --> 35:25.916
Hey.
Hey.

35:25.951 --> 35:27.217
What are you doing here?

35:27.252 --> 35:28.419
I'm just dropping Robie off.

35:28.453 --> 35:29.620
Your dad's taking
him for the weekend.

35:29.654 --> 35:30.854
But it's not the weekend.

35:30.889 --> 35:31.922
It's the middle of the week.

35:31.957 --> 35:33.557
Yeah, I know, but he offered,
so...

35:33.591 --> 35:35.225
do you want to come
back with me?

35:35.260 --> 35:37.695
It's a school night.
That's the beauty
of home school.

35:37.729 --> 35:38.662
You can do it anywhere.

35:38.697 --> 35:40.564
What about Amy?

35:40.598 --> 35:42.399
Amy doesn't have that option.

35:42.434 --> 35:44.868
Besides, how often do you and
I get to spend time together

35:44.903 --> 35:46.136
without Amy or Robby?

35:47.405 --> 35:48.539
It'll be fun.

35:48.573 --> 35:51.675
We can stay up late,
go to the movies.

35:51.710 --> 35:53.544
You can even come with me
to play rummy

35:53.578 --> 35:56.380
at Mimsy's assisted care.

35:56.414 --> 35:58.782
That sounds like fun.
Yeah, it is.

35:58.817 --> 36:01.085
So why don't you just throw
some stuff in a bag,
and let's go.

36:01.119 --> 36:03.287
All right, I will.

36:03.321 --> 36:06.390
[tapping cell phone]

36:06.424 --> 36:07.758
Toby?

36:07.792 --> 36:09.293
I just want to let him know
I won't be here.

36:09.327 --> 36:10.861
That's good.
You should let him know.

36:13.398 --> 36:14.431
What's that look?

36:14.466 --> 36:16.934
Nothing, not a look.

36:16.968 --> 36:18.202
He's just a friend.

36:18.236 --> 36:19.703
No-- a friend.

36:20.839 --> 36:22.272
Oh, my God,
is he more than a friend?

36:22.307 --> 36:24.308
No, he is not more
than a friend.

36:25.744 --> 36:27.411
Friend is good.

36:27.445 --> 36:29.947
Yeah, it's nice to have
someone to talk to.

36:29.981 --> 36:31.482
You can always talk to me,
you know.

36:31.516 --> 36:32.983
Yeah, I know.

36:33.018 --> 36:34.785
And I can talk to you
about you.

36:36.087 --> 36:37.121
[sighs]

36:37.155 --> 36:39.423
Just...

36:39.457 --> 36:42.593
Feel so stupid
and ashamed of myself.

36:43.828 --> 36:46.397
Yeah, I think we all do.

36:48.466 --> 36:51.268
Should we call Ricky?

36:51.302 --> 36:53.003
Do you want to call Ricky?

36:55.940 --> 36:59.376
No. No, I think I'll wait
a few days to talk to him.

36:59.411 --> 37:02.413
Yeah, that might be
a good idea.

37:06.351 --> 37:08.252
I'm going to be
a better person.

37:10.522 --> 37:14.658
Me, too, but neither of us
are bad people.

37:14.692 --> 37:17.061
No, but--
[sighs]

37:17.095 --> 37:18.162
...I've said some bad things,

37:18.196 --> 37:21.231
and I've done some bad things.

37:21.266 --> 37:22.866
Everybody has.

37:24.869 --> 37:27.771
Really? You think?

37:28.840 --> 37:30.240
I think.

37:36.981 --> 37:38.982
Do you think we'll be
good parents?

37:40.718 --> 37:42.586
Yeah, I think we'll be
good parents.

37:44.155 --> 37:45.856
I think we'll still make
mistakes,

37:45.890 --> 37:48.392
but we'll be good parents.

37:49.527 --> 37:50.894
Thanks for loving me, Ben.

37:50.929 --> 37:52.796
Pleasure.

37:52.831 --> 37:54.031
Thanks for loving me.

38:02.107 --> 38:04.274
[knock on door]

38:04.309 --> 38:05.742
I'm coming.

38:10.548 --> 38:12.216
[sighs]
I'm sorry.

38:12.250 --> 38:15.119
Yeah. Come on in.

38:21.559 --> 38:23.360
I'm not going to stay long.

38:23.394 --> 38:25.896
I just wanted to say that
face to face.

38:25.930 --> 38:28.532
[chuckles]
No matter how red my face is.

38:28.566 --> 38:29.867
I'm really sorry.

38:29.901 --> 38:32.803
Yeah, well...

38:32.837 --> 38:36.106
you and I have never really
talked about my past.

38:36.141 --> 38:38.142
I don't really like
to talk about it.

38:39.310 --> 38:40.844
I lost my temper.

38:40.879 --> 38:42.279
I don't like to do that either.

38:42.313 --> 38:44.982
It's understandable that
you would lose your temper.

38:46.484 --> 38:49.553
And, you know,
if you ever wanted to talk
about what happened

38:49.587 --> 38:51.121
and all of that,

38:51.156 --> 38:52.389
you can talk to me.

38:52.423 --> 38:55.125
Or I can talk to my shrink.

38:55.160 --> 38:59.696
I don't want to get our lives
entangled in my past, okay?

38:59.731 --> 39:01.532
I've worked really hard

39:01.566 --> 39:04.234
for years to let that stuff go.

39:04.269 --> 39:06.403
Or I've tried to let
that stuff go,

39:06.437 --> 39:09.306
and I'm still trying
to let that stuff go.

39:10.575 --> 39:11.942
It would be all right
if I hugged you?

39:11.976 --> 39:13.677
How about I hug you?

39:18.149 --> 39:19.883
I'm really sorry.

39:19.918 --> 39:21.451
Me, too, Amy.

39:21.486 --> 39:22.853
Me, too.

39:24.122 --> 39:27.391
I n't believe
I'm even going to ask this,

39:27.425 --> 39:29.259
but, uh...

39:32.931 --> 39:34.598
is there going to be a shower?

39:47.378 --> 39:49.279
Well...

39:49.314 --> 39:50.847
this is nice.

39:50.882 --> 39:53.183
We have the whole place
to ourselves.

39:53.218 --> 39:55.986
Yeah, yeah, the--

39:56.020 --> 39:57.888
the whole place.

39:59.824 --> 40:02.125
I haven't really seen
much of you lately.

40:02.160 --> 40:05.562
Yeah. Yeah, we've both been
really busy, you especially.

40:05.597 --> 40:06.730
How's the condo coming?

40:06.764 --> 40:09.233
Oh, it-- it's coming along.

40:09.267 --> 40:11.602
We've got the new window
treatments in,

40:11.636 --> 40:12.970
and the nursery set up,

40:13.004 --> 40:15.672
and, well,
most of the furniture is there.

40:15.707 --> 40:17.441
The previous owners
left some things,

40:17.475 --> 40:19.176
so we just added to that.

40:19.210 --> 40:21.678
So are you ready
for the wedding?

40:21.713 --> 40:25.382
I mean, in two weeks you're
going to be Mrs. Ben Boykewich.

40:25.416 --> 40:27.584
Yeah, I'm ready.

40:27.619 --> 40:30.787
I'm ready to be
Mrs. Ben Boykewich,

40:30.822 --> 40:33.657
but I'm not ready
for the wedding.

40:33.691 --> 40:37.928
I haven't picked
the photographer or ordered
the flowers or any of that,

40:37.962 --> 40:40.264
but I do have a dress.

40:40.298 --> 40:42.399
Yeah. I love your dress.

40:42.433 --> 40:44.067
Yeah.

40:46.771 --> 40:50.807
Hi. The sign outside said
"Closed for a private party."

40:50.842 --> 40:52.142
I don't think
that people understood

40:52.176 --> 40:53.710
that the shower
was the private party.

40:53.745 --> 40:55.512
Sit down.

40:55.546 --> 40:57.347
Yeah, please.

41:00.551 --> 41:01.718
Hey.

41:01.753 --> 41:03.253
Hey, Adrian.
Hi.

41:03.288 --> 41:05.055
Congratulations
on your wedding,

41:05.089 --> 41:06.290
and the baby.

41:06.324 --> 41:08.692
Yeah, and thanks
for inviting us to the shower.

41:08.726 --> 41:10.093
Thank you for coming.

41:15.533 --> 41:17.067
Bar Mitzvah cancelled.

41:17.101 --> 41:18.468
So glad I got to come.

41:18.503 --> 41:19.603
Mazel tov.

41:19.637 --> 41:20.904
Thank you, Alice.

41:20.938 --> 41:22.472
I'm really happy you're here.

41:22.507 --> 41:23.840
And I'm sorry
about the bar mitzvah.

41:23.875 --> 41:25.475
That's okay.
My cousin's not really Jewish.

41:25.510 --> 41:27.010
He just wanted a bar mitzvah

41:27.045 --> 41:28.045
because all his friends
are Jewish.

41:28.079 --> 41:29.680
See ya.

41:32.417 --> 41:34.618
Hey.

41:34.652 --> 41:35.652
Hi.

41:35.687 --> 41:36.653
I'm Marsha.

41:36.688 --> 41:38.322
We were lab partners last year.

41:38.356 --> 41:40.223
You stayed
after class to help me
with a homework assignment.

41:40.258 --> 41:42.592
Oh, yeah, Marsha. Hi.

41:42.627 --> 41:46.897
Uh, I don't like
that kind of thing to get out,
you know?

41:46.931 --> 41:49.132
Oh, yeah. Got it.

41:49.167 --> 41:51.635
Well, good luck
with everything,

41:51.669 --> 41:53.036
and thanks for inviting me.

41:53.071 --> 41:54.871
Sure.

41:58.409 --> 41:59.843
This is so grownup.

41:59.877 --> 42:02.312
Then again,
I guess getting married
and having a baby

42:02.347 --> 42:03.714
is, well, pretty grownup.

42:03.748 --> 42:04.881
Uh-huh.

42:06.017 --> 42:07.451
Adrian, you remember Lisa.

42:07.485 --> 42:08.985
You let me sit
with you at lunch

42:09.020 --> 42:09.953
my first day of school.

42:09.987 --> 42:11.655
Oh, yeah, of course.

42:11.689 --> 42:13.457
Good to see you.
Thank you for coming.

42:13.491 --> 42:15.425
Sure. Thanks for letting me.

42:21.632 --> 42:22.566
This is Debbie.

42:22.600 --> 42:25.035
Duh, I think Adrian knows
who I am.

42:25.103 --> 42:27.771
Hey, Adrian, congratulations.
Long time no see.

42:28.873 --> 42:29.973
Debbie told me the story

42:30.007 --> 42:31.842
about how she was in the
bathroom crying one day,

42:31.876 --> 42:33.844
and you told her
to dump her boyfriend.

42:33.878 --> 42:37.314
Yes, and how is
your boyfriend, Debbie?

42:37.348 --> 42:38.348
He's still dumped.

42:38.383 --> 42:39.516
Oh, well, good.

42:39.550 --> 42:41.852
Yeah. Well, here you go.

42:41.886 --> 42:43.220
Thank you.

42:45.590 --> 42:47.491
Amy and I have been
working really hard.

42:47.525 --> 42:50.026
As it turns out, you do
have plenty of friends.

42:50.061 --> 42:51.628
Maybe it was the pity speech
in the hallway.

42:51.662 --> 42:54.865
Yeah, that might have had
a little something to do
with it.

42:54.899 --> 42:57.200
Or maybe you're just not
as bad as you think.

42:57.235 --> 42:58.802
Thank you, Grace.

43:00.071 --> 43:01.772
Thanks, Amy.

43:03.274 --> 43:04.674
