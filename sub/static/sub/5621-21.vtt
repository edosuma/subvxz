This punk is

00:21.822 --> 00:23.522
suing me for malpractice.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.791
This Cory Manler
is really prepared.

00:25.793 --> 00:27.559
The statute of limitations
is tolled...

00:27.561 --> 00:28.961
What does "tolled" mean?

00:28.963 --> 00:29.895
It means we're screwed.

00:29.897 --> 00:31.130
Manler is a puppet.

00:31.132 --> 00:32.364
Someone's pulling the strings.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.365
Who are you working with?!

00:33.367 --> 00:34.700
What are you hiding, Pop?

00:34.702 --> 00:35.934
Maybe I screwed up.

(seagulls squawking) ¶ ¶

00:46.480 --> 00:48.947
She looks great.

00:53.387 --> 00:54.887
You're home.

00:54.889 --> 00:56.889
Didn't you hear?

00:56.891 --> 00:58.490
The war's over.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.129
(dramatic music swells)

01:13.274 --> 01:14.907
Hey...

01:14.909 --> 01:16.408
you know what?

01:16.410 --> 01:19.845
I think it's moments like this
we need to cherish, Dad.

01:19.847 --> 01:21.914
I just want you to know,
I've always looked up to you.

01:21.916 --> 01:25.250
(echoing): The war
made me realize this.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.586
I just want to
make you proud, Pop.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.721
Because you've always been my...

01:29.723 --> 01:31.924
Pop. Pop, can you hear me?

01:31.926 --> 01:33.692
"S"...

01:33.694 --> 01:35.961
Inkspot.

01:35.963 --> 01:38.363
Sink... spot, sink spot!
That's it.

01:38.365 --> 01:39.431
What's it?

01:39.433 --> 01:42.434
The spot I saw in the sink.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.269
It wasn't hair dye.

01:44.271 --> 01:45.604
It was blood.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.607
Take care of yourself, son.

01:50.978 --> 01:54.313
The name of the boat
was the SS<i> Inkspot?</i>

01:54.315 --> 01:56.715
I noticed that, too.
You noticed what?

01:56.717 --> 01:58.617
I mean, you think that's
a normal thing to name a boat

01:58.619 --> 02:00.052
if you're not
trying to lead someone

02:00.054 --> 02:01.553
to a blood spot in your sink?

02:01.555 --> 02:03.088
You know, I don't like
the tone of this.

02:03.090 --> 02:04.590
What are you now,
the logic police?

02:04.592 --> 02:05.924
I-It doesn't matter.

02:05.926 --> 02:07.926
I mean, it-it worked, you know?
Leave it alone.

02:07.928 --> 02:08.760
I have another question.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.596
Ugh. Yes, Officer?

02:10.598 --> 02:13.332
Sorry. Um, I just
was wondering...

02:13.334 --> 02:15.601
So he just leaves his son

02:15.603 --> 02:17.436
right after he gets home
from the war?

02:17.438 --> 02:18.637
Oh, yeah. What war?

02:18.639 --> 02:19.838
Nobody cares about the war.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.773
The case got solved.
That's what you care about.

02:21.775 --> 02:25.277
The whole kid nonsense
is just a side story

02:25.279 --> 02:28.614
to help me solve the conflict
of the main story.

02:28.616 --> 02:30.315
Well, that seems like a whole other thing.
Why doesn't he just

02:30.317 --> 02:32.651
solve the main story, then?
Why-why take that detour?

02:32.653 --> 02:34.953
Go straight for it. Can't you just solve
the case by, yeah, working on that?

02:34.955 --> 02:36.221
I'll ask you, Sheriff.

02:37.191 --> 02:39.291
Have you? Have I what?

02:39.293 --> 02:41.860
Solved our big case
just by working on it?

02:41.862 --> 02:44.296
Oh... that is a very good point.

02:44.298 --> 02:45.364
Thank you, Debbie.

02:45.366 --> 02:46.999
I think...

02:47.001 --> 02:48.867
it's time we start doing things

02:48.869 --> 02:52.004
a little differently
around here.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.674
I'm not getting involved in
a side story with you, Dean.

02:55.676 --> 02:56.975
I'm not doing it.

02:56.977 --> 02:59.144
I'm telling you that right now.

02:59.146 --> 03:01.213
¶ ¶

03:03.651 --> 03:06.118
Well? What do you think?

03:06.120 --> 03:08.787
So you want to stop working
on the case entirely

03:08.789 --> 03:10.122
so that we can join you

03:10.124 --> 03:11.823
on a side story
that will enable you

03:11.825 --> 03:13.792
to figure out... what now?

03:13.794 --> 03:15.127
The answer to who's
behind the whole case.

03:15.129 --> 03:16.962
Come on, Claire.
He just laid it out for us.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.163
Sorry. I'm in.

03:18.165 --> 03:19.698
Well, I'm only gonna need
one or two of you.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.633
Because, uh, the main case
has to continue.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.302
It's a simultaneous approach.
Yeah.

03:23.304 --> 03:24.970
You guys talking side story?
Oh, yeah.

03:24.972 --> 03:27.206
How about this? How about you
two keep things flowing here

03:27.208 --> 03:28.740
and Stew and I will chase
something down?

03:28.742 --> 03:30.242
Oh, I'm not gonna chase
anything down with you, Dean.

03:30.244 --> 03:31.977
I told you that. Good, 'cause
I'd like to throw my hat

03:31.979 --> 03:33.312
in the side story ring.

03:33.314 --> 03:35.147
Yeah, I-I mean, if...
if it works. You know.

03:35.149 --> 03:36.648
But we don't even know
what the side story is yet.

03:36.650 --> 03:37.983
Is that maybe
'cause it's nothing?

03:37.985 --> 03:40.052
It's gonna be something.
Oh, Dean.

03:40.054 --> 03:41.587
Look, Dad screwed up. Okay?

03:41.589 --> 03:43.589
We don't have a case.
We need to settle.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.424
So we're gonna admit defeat?

03:45.426 --> 03:47.059
You okay with that, Deano?

03:47.061 --> 03:48.694
What do you think?
What's the plan?

03:48.696 --> 03:50.729
Well, Dean wants to get involved
in a side story.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.699
Oh. So he can see if it sparks
something in the real case?

03:53.701 --> 03:55.534
That makes sense to you?
Hell yes it does.

03:55.536 --> 03:57.436
Have we found the side thing yet?
Still looking for it.

03:57.438 --> 03:59.404
I have some ideas
that I think...

03:59.406 --> 04:00.372
Todd! What did I tell you?

04:00.374 --> 04:02.040
You said, "If it works."

04:02.042 --> 04:04.042
And do we know if it works yet?
Claire?

04:04.044 --> 04:06.211
Oh. No, we don't.

04:06.213 --> 04:08.880
But keep your heads up, guys,
because something tells me

04:08.882 --> 04:10.048
we're gonna find something.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.250
Oh, good.

04:11.252 --> 04:15.687
We just got to not look
in all the right places.

04:17.391 --> 04:18.657
Mm-hmm.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.727
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

04:22.596 --> 04:23.795
30 dollars?

04:23.797 --> 04:25.297
What do you need $30 for?

04:25.299 --> 04:26.965
I can't say, but just trust me
that it's important.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.400
Okay, well, until you can say,

04:28.402 --> 04:29.735
you're not getting it. Mm-hmm.

04:29.737 --> 04:30.569
What happened to
the hundo I gave you?

04:30.571 --> 04:31.937
What? You gave him $100?

04:31.939 --> 04:33.305
What is going on?

04:33.307 --> 04:34.573
Was it... what,
a field trip or something?

04:34.575 --> 04:35.741
A field trip?

04:35.743 --> 04:37.075
Ethan, you do not have
a field trip coming up.

04:37.077 --> 04:38.644
Okay.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.279
I'm in pretty deep
to Zack Landsman.

04:40.281 --> 04:42.080
I lost a few bets that
I thought were a sure thing.

04:42.082 --> 04:44.082
What are you betting on? When
did you start gambling, Ethan?

04:44.084 --> 04:45.917
Is this our side deal?

04:45.919 --> 04:47.085
I'm not sure yet.

04:47.087 --> 04:48.587
I'd like to know
what's going on down there.

04:48.589 --> 04:49.821
Lizzie...

04:49.823 --> 04:50.956
you seem really quiet.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.424
You don't have any reaction

04:52.426 --> 04:53.825
to your brother's
addiction problem?

04:53.827 --> 04:55.761
No, not really. I kind of got
my own stuff going on.

04:55.763 --> 04:56.495
What kind of stuff?

04:56.497 --> 04:57.763
Guys...

04:57.765 --> 04:59.097
that is not this, okay?

04:59.099 --> 05:00.499
One thing at a time, please.

05:00.501 --> 05:01.933
But that's the mistake
you keep making.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.602
It's never one thing at a time,

05:03.604 --> 05:05.504
because the second it is,
you're dead.

05:05.506 --> 05:06.271
We're dead?

05:06.273 --> 05:07.773
Look, I'm telling you...

05:07.775 --> 05:09.308
there's something
going on down there.

05:09.310 --> 05:10.842
Well, Joel's in
a lot of trouble at school

05:10.844 --> 05:12.444
and it looks like
he might get expelled.

05:12.446 --> 05:13.745
Oh, honey, I thought
you guys broke up.

05:13.747 --> 05:15.314
Yeah, we did,
but he's really vulnerable

05:15.316 --> 05:16.982
and I've just never seen him
like that, so...

05:16.984 --> 05:18.517
Yeah. (Taps table)

05:18.519 --> 05:19.785
Yeah.

05:19.787 --> 05:20.952
It's real.

05:20.954 --> 05:24.122
It's emotional, it's timely.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.457
It's compelling.

05:25.459 --> 05:26.825
What do you say? You take
the boy, I take the girl.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.126
Guys... Sounds good.

05:28.128 --> 05:29.528
All right.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.864
(phone rings)

05:32.866 --> 05:34.132
Hello?

05:34.134 --> 05:35.467
DEBBIE: Hey, are you there yet?

05:35.469 --> 05:37.202
Uh-huh.

05:37.204 --> 05:38.637
Oh, good. Okay. Well,
I'm about five minutes away,

05:38.639 --> 05:40.105
so I'll see you
in just a second.

05:40.107 --> 05:42.040
Okay, yes. No, I mean,
I'm on my way, too.

05:42.042 --> 05:44.209
I'm not there yet... It does not sound
like you're in your car, honey.

05:44.211 --> 05:45.644
No, 'cause it's
a very quiet interior.

05:45.646 --> 05:46.478
You forgot, didn't you?

05:46.480 --> 05:47.679
I forgot.

05:47.681 --> 05:48.814
I cannot believe
that you forgot.

05:48.816 --> 05:49.981
I totally forgot. I'm so sorry.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.483
Can you just tell me
what we're doing

05:51.485 --> 05:52.718
and I'll get there in
two seconds, I promise you.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.386
Ethan's parent/teacher
conference, honey.

05:54.388 --> 05:55.687
I reminded you last night.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.556
You did.
Oh, man, that's a big one.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.191
I'm so sorry, honey,

05:59.193 --> 06:01.326
but I-I scheduled this
settlement meeting for now.

06:01.328 --> 06:03.161
Well, move it, honey,
because we have moved this

06:03.163 --> 06:05.030
three times already.
You've got to be here.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.898
I will, I will show up.
I will be there. Okay.

06:06.900 --> 06:07.899
Are you even walking yet

06:07.901 --> 06:09.034
or are you just sitting
behind your desk?

06:09.036 --> 06:10.736
You know I don't like
to walk and talk!

06:10.738 --> 06:12.371
I think that's rude
to the person listening.

06:12.373 --> 06:13.672
It's the point
of a mobile phone.

06:13.674 --> 06:14.873
All right, then just..
Can you...

06:14.875 --> 06:16.174
You know this is my thing...

06:16.176 --> 06:17.676
JOEL: <i>I did it.</i>

06:17.678 --> 06:18.844
I trashed
the principal's office,

06:18.846 --> 06:20.912
'cause I felt like it,

06:20.914 --> 06:22.347
and I'm willing to accept
whatever punishment.

06:22.349 --> 06:24.249
No, okay?
Uncle Dean can help, right?

06:24.251 --> 06:25.884
I mean, we can't just give up.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.519
Nothing is ever that simple,
Lizzie.

06:27.521 --> 06:30.222
I wish... it were.

06:30.224 --> 06:31.556
Kind of is.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.525
I mean, it's just gonna be
a slap on the wrist.

06:33.527 --> 06:37.062
Nothing... is<i> ever...</i>

06:37.064 --> 06:39.197
a slap on the wrist.

06:39.199 --> 06:41.233
Okay.

06:41.235 --> 06:44.035
So wait. Why did you pull
me out of class? You know,

06:44.037 --> 06:46.772
I used to have a gambling
problem myself. Yeah?

06:46.774 --> 06:50.375
The ponies. Almost lost
your dad's college tuition.

06:50.377 --> 06:51.877
What did you do?
Did you get help?

06:51.879 --> 06:53.912
Nope. I put it all on the line.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.615
I borrowed everything I
could from everyone I knew,

06:56.617 --> 06:59.751
and I laid it on
Miss Makkos in the fifth.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.620
And did you win? Not even close.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.955
That was a rough
year for all of us.

07:03.957 --> 07:06.925
So what if I lose
and bring down everyone with me?

07:06.927 --> 07:09.060
That's a very real possibility.

07:09.062 --> 07:11.897
I think it feels easier just
to lie to my parents, make up

07:11.899 --> 07:13.932
(echoing): Some reason why
I need to switch schools,

07:13.934 --> 07:16.301
and never see
Zack Landsman again.

07:16.303 --> 07:18.770
You want to run.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.772
Yeah. Maybe I do.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.240
DEAN: <i>Joel,</i>

07:22.242 --> 07:24.075
there's something
that you're not telling us.

07:24.077 --> 07:25.477
What is it?

07:25.479 --> 07:26.445
I told you everything, bro.

07:26.447 --> 07:27.913
That's it.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.915
I'm out of here.
Uncle Dean, he's not ly...

07:29.917 --> 07:32.451
Get your head out
of the clouds, Lizzie.

07:32.453 --> 07:33.785
He's lying to us.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.707
What? Wait.

07:36.590 --> 07:37.823
Okay, it wasn't me.

07:38.759 --> 07:41.026
You're protecting someone.

07:42.162 --> 07:43.395
Protection.

07:43.397 --> 07:45.230
Security.

07:45.232 --> 07:46.798
Insecurity.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.767
Ugh. Thought I had something.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.268
Thought you had what?

07:50.270 --> 07:52.504
Nothing.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.345
DEBBIE: I know, honey,
I'm just saying.

08:00.347 --> 08:01.780
We had it scheduled for a month,

08:01.782 --> 08:03.181
and I-I... I just
think it's weird.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.783
I know, it's weird.
I usually write it down,

08:04.785 --> 08:06.418
and I don't know what happened.

08:06.420 --> 08:07.686
So you're talking,
what, you're talking

08:07.688 --> 08:09.421
how you rescheduled
the settlement?

08:09.423 --> 08:12.624
Uh, yeah, we just had this other
thing at Ethan's school, so...

08:12.626 --> 08:14.159
Interesting.
Why is that interesting?

08:14.161 --> 08:16.528
You tell me. I don't know.
That's why I asked you.

08:16.530 --> 08:20.198
You are familiar with
my position on settling, right?

08:20.200 --> 08:22.000
Oh, I am.
You don't like to do it.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.101
That's an understatement.

08:23.103 --> 08:24.936
Have you ever
considered that maybe

08:24.938 --> 08:27.372
deep down inside,

08:27.374 --> 08:30.275
Stewbie doesn't want
to settle either?

08:30.277 --> 08:32.277
Oh, my gosh, you think
that I purposefully scheduled

08:32.279 --> 08:34.279
this other thing to get
in the way of the settlement.

08:34.281 --> 08:36.281
Most likely, yes,
on a subconscious level.

08:36.283 --> 08:39.784
And that maybe your big brother
rubbed off on you.

08:39.786 --> 08:42.220
Oh, got a little
Grinder in you, hon.

08:42.222 --> 08:43.855
I think we all have

08:43.857 --> 08:45.490
a little Grinder in us.

08:45.492 --> 08:48.293
It's just a question of...
what are you gonna do with it?

08:48.295 --> 08:51.463
Probably just have it reschedule
the settlement meeting.

08:51.465 --> 08:52.898
Well, that'll work
for a little bit,

08:52.900 --> 08:55.901
but then something else...
will keep you...

08:55.903 --> 08:57.936
from doing that.

09:05.379 --> 09:07.045
(whispering): How long
is this gonna go on?

09:07.047 --> 09:08.280
Just a little bit longer.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.384
And s...

09:13.987 --> 09:15.220
stop. Okay, good. Oh, my God.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.022
I need a glass of wine. Right?

09:17.024 --> 09:19.704
That was intense. He's really
committed to that thing.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.994
Ugh.

09:25.499 --> 09:26.498
(groans)

09:26.500 --> 09:28.333
Todd, are you okay?

09:28.335 --> 09:30.769
No, I wanted to get into
something with Dean.

09:30.771 --> 09:33.505
I was up all night; I just can't
figure out how to hook him.

09:33.507 --> 09:35.106
You don't say.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.508
Help me, Claire. What do I do?

09:36.510 --> 09:38.276
Just maybe back up. Yeah. On it.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.344
Maybe a little further. Further?

09:39.346 --> 09:41.846
Always. Um, I don't know.

09:41.848 --> 09:43.682
Uh, maybe stop
thinking about it?

09:43.684 --> 09:45.350
Think about something else
for a while?

09:45.352 --> 09:47.352
Like what? Um...

09:47.354 --> 09:51.289
Maybe you could
finish all of this,

09:51.291 --> 09:54.092
and, you know, while
you're making the copies,

09:54.094 --> 09:55.927
you'll figure
something else out?

09:55.929 --> 09:59.030
So this could be my side thing
to figure out that side thing?

10:00.300 --> 10:02.367
But is this enough? It'll
only take me a couple hours.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.035
Oh, I have a bunch more
in my office.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.604
(chuckles): Okay. Thank you.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.038
Thank you. No problem.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.274
Lifesaver.

10:10.877 --> 10:12.243
JOEL: <i>I told you,</i>

10:12.245 --> 10:13.545
I'm not protecting anyone.

10:13.547 --> 10:15.547
So it's not that,
but what else is it?

10:15.549 --> 10:17.115
Say some other things.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.984
Well, he doesn't think
they're gonna believe him

10:18.986 --> 10:20.986
over Chad Oseroff, because
Oseroff's dad is tight

10:20.988 --> 10:22.387
with Principal Davis. Oseroff.

10:22.389 --> 10:23.588
Oseroff...

10:23.590 --> 10:26.124
the beaten path? Nah.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.425
What? Cross-er-off?

10:27.427 --> 10:30.161
Cross her... cross who off?
Of what?

10:30.163 --> 10:31.930
Dude, are you thinking
about something else?

10:31.932 --> 10:33.498
(laughs): What?!

10:33.500 --> 10:36.001
No, I'm thinking about this.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.037
And...

10:45.312 --> 10:47.312
that.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.180
Whatever. It-it doesn't matter.
They already think I did it.

10:49.182 --> 10:50.949
What's the point?
The point is that

10:50.951 --> 10:53.184
you have to keep this going.
<i>We</i> have to keep this going.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.020
Keep it going why? For what?

10:55.022 --> 10:56.655
Well, for you, pal.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.790
And-and your school record
or whatever.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.592
He wants to help, Joel.
I mean, just let him help.

11:00.594 --> 11:03.161
Don't you have
more important things to do?

11:03.163 --> 11:05.096
I have this.

11:06.033 --> 11:09.834
And<i> only...</i> this.

11:12.305 --> 11:15.173
Okay.

11:16.143 --> 11:19.277
Now take me to Chad Oseroff.

11:20.347 --> 11:23.381
Hey, honey. How was
the settlement... Oh!

11:23.383 --> 11:24.683
What happened to you?

11:24.685 --> 11:26.518
I got a flat tire. Ugh!

11:26.520 --> 11:28.687
And I spent 45 minutes on
the phone with roadside assist,

11:28.689 --> 11:30.989
only to I find out that our
membership expired. Ooh.

11:30.991 --> 11:33.158
Fortunately, my cell phone
completely died after that,

11:33.160 --> 11:35.860
so I had to change a tire all by myself.
How fun for you.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.562
And then I missed the settlement.
Again?

11:37.564 --> 11:40.065
Yes! And Dean thinks
I did it on purpose.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.900
You know, like I'm...
like I'm intentionally

11:41.902 --> 11:43.368
blowing off the settlement.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.737
Are you? No!

11:45.739 --> 11:48.506
You think I'm doing that, too?
Maybe subconsciously?

11:48.508 --> 11:50.675
Oh, my gosh, you're worse than him.
Okay.

11:50.677 --> 11:52.077
What, you think
I'm trying to avoid settling

11:52.079 --> 11:53.878
because, deep down inside,

11:53.880 --> 11:56.715
I don't want to settle?
And don't... don't say "okay"

11:56.717 --> 11:58.883
with your voice real high
and your eyebrows up.

11:58.885 --> 12:01.419
(deep voice): Okay. Okay.
That's a better one. Thank you.

12:01.421 --> 12:02.421
Okay.

12:05.692 --> 12:07.625
(door opens)

12:11.231 --> 12:13.598
Grandpa? (Whispering): Shh.
Go back to sleep.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.934
I'm just leaving these for you.

12:15.936 --> 12:18.403
What are they? They're nothing.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.371
They're just envelopes
for you to open

12:20.373 --> 12:22.774
on the most important days
of your life.

12:22.776 --> 12:25.610
"Your high school graduation."

12:25.612 --> 12:27.946
"Congrats on the birth
of your first child."

12:27.948 --> 12:29.414
Grandpa, what is all this?

12:29.416 --> 12:32.584
Take care, Ethan.
You're a good kid.

12:33.754 --> 12:36.121
(door closes)

12:36.123 --> 12:37.756
I'm sorry, Bones. I really am.

12:37.758 --> 12:39.124
BRENNAN: If I wasn't there,

12:39.126 --> 12:40.525
the prosecution's...

12:40.527 --> 12:42.694
Okay, did all these. And?

12:42.696 --> 12:44.362
Didn't spark anything.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.631
Oh, damn. Hmm.

12:46.633 --> 12:48.867
Do you want to maybe try those?

12:51.371 --> 12:52.604
Yeah.

12:52.606 --> 12:53.738
(sighs)

12:53.740 --> 12:58.076
(grunts)

12:58.078 --> 13:00.311
You got it? Yes.

13:00.313 --> 13:01.746
Okay.

13:01.748 --> 13:03.648
Thanks, Claire.

13:05.051 --> 13:07.552
Chad Oseroff.

13:07.554 --> 13:10.922
We finally put a face to the name.
What's this about, Zadak?

13:10.924 --> 13:12.891
You trashed Principal Davis's
office, and you know it.

13:12.893 --> 13:15.326
Okay. Dean's defending me.

13:15.328 --> 13:16.661
He arranged a
disciplinary hearing.

13:16.663 --> 13:18.229
Oh. Okay.

13:18.231 --> 13:19.931
He's not gonna be able
to prove anything.

13:19.933 --> 13:22.734
Excuse me? What are you gonna
do, Grind it out of me?

13:22.736 --> 13:24.402
Yeah, if I want to.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.304
But you don't, do you?

13:26.306 --> 13:28.139
Because that's not
why you're really here.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.074
Wait. What's he talking about?

13:30.076 --> 13:31.743
Nothing.

13:31.745 --> 13:34.512
He's... grasping at straws.

13:34.514 --> 13:35.680
Think about it, Joel.

13:35.682 --> 13:36.815
He doesn't really care
about this.

13:36.817 --> 13:39.083
Yeah, of course he does.
Right, Uncle Dean?

13:39.085 --> 13:41.953
It's not as simple as that.
What does that mean?

13:41.955 --> 13:43.755
It means he's using you.
That is not true!

13:43.757 --> 13:44.689
I knew it!

13:44.691 --> 13:46.090
Look, I can explain this.

13:46.092 --> 13:47.458
Don't bother.

13:47.460 --> 13:48.893
Uncle Dean, do something!

13:50.931 --> 13:52.997
Joel, wait!

13:54.301 --> 13:56.434
Yes, maybe at first

13:56.436 --> 13:59.103
I got involved for
the wrong reasons.

13:59.105 --> 14:02.040
I needed to focus
on a side story

14:02.042 --> 14:04.602
to help me solve
my father's case.

14:05.645 --> 14:08.780
Yeah, well, this little
side story is my main story.

14:08.782 --> 14:10.715
It's called my life!

14:10.717 --> 14:12.237
(softly): Joel.

14:23.897 --> 14:25.697
Stewart should be here
any minute, Mr. Manler.

14:25.699 --> 14:28.299
That's cool. It's not like
I have anything better to do.

14:29.236 --> 14:30.468
Th-That sounded sarcastic.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.003
I-I really have nothing better.

14:32.005 --> 14:35.139
Man-ler. Luring a man.

14:35.876 --> 14:38.076
Luring men.
Luring men somewhere?

14:38.078 --> 14:39.377
But where?!

14:39.379 --> 14:40.912
No, that's not it.

14:40.914 --> 14:42.914
Todd, it's okay. We'll find it.
Find what?

14:42.916 --> 14:44.482
Mr. Manler, sorry I'm late.

14:44.484 --> 14:47.018
I was... looking for my keys
for 20 minutes.

14:47.020 --> 14:49.320
Um, ready to wrap this thing up?

14:49.322 --> 14:50.588
Uh, yeah, I guess.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.223
Okay.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.893
Uh... hold on.

14:55.929 --> 14:57.695
I don't seem to have
the agreement.

14:57.697 --> 14:59.063
Oh, it was just here.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.765
It's okay. Todd, do you
want to type up a new one?

15:00.767 --> 15:02.200
Yes.

15:02.202 --> 15:04.903
Sorry about that.
Shouldn't be very long.

15:08.842 --> 15:11.042
All right, Joel, you wanted
this hearing about what again?

15:11.044 --> 15:12.510
CHAD: He thinks

15:12.512 --> 15:13.678
I trashed your office, sir.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.680
Which obviously I didn't.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.515
What?! You think Oseroff did it?

15:17.517 --> 15:19.217
Okay, you know,
I don't believe that.

15:19.219 --> 15:20.218
What is your defense?

15:20.220 --> 15:21.686
I thought I had one.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.288
But I guess I'm alone in this.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.023
You're not alone;
I'm right here.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.424
And so am I.

15:28.094 --> 15:31.930
Principal Davis...
let's get this thing started.

15:31.932 --> 15:34.065
Well, we've already
started, so...

15:34.067 --> 15:36.701
(sighs) All right, so let's...
continue this thing?

15:36.703 --> 15:38.469
Is... is that
what you're looking for?

15:38.471 --> 15:40.538
Uh, yeah. Well, then
let's just go with that

15:40.540 --> 15:42.473
(mouths)

15:45.712 --> 15:47.879
What's with the cooler?

15:47.881 --> 15:49.948
Nothing. I'm going fishing.

15:52.886 --> 15:54.919
You're not going fishing,
are you?

15:54.921 --> 15:56.220
You're running.

15:56.222 --> 15:57.555
Because of the case.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.624
Yeah? Okay, so what if I am?

15:59.626 --> 16:01.159
You gonna try and stop me?

16:01.161 --> 16:03.227
Take me with you.

16:03.229 --> 16:04.996
Absolutely not.

16:04.998 --> 16:07.298
You got your school,
you got soccer.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.766
You have a life here.

16:08.768 --> 16:11.669
Yeah, well, not if Zack Landsman
has anything to say about it.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.742
Grab the other end.

16:17.744 --> 16:18.943
STEWART: <i>So, settling...</i>

16:18.945 --> 16:20.745
It's just...
it's where we're at.

16:20.747 --> 16:22.246
Uh, it's just... it's-it's

16:22.248 --> 16:25.583
what we have to do
at this point.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.518
Yeah, sometimes you got to know
when to give up.

16:27.520 --> 16:30.788
Well, I-I wouldn't
call it giving up, Mr. Manler.

16:30.790 --> 16:32.457
I would.
TODD: Okay, new document,

16:32.459 --> 16:34.492
ready to sign.

16:35.595 --> 16:38.096
Let's, uh...

16:38.098 --> 16:40.264
put this baby to bed, huh?

16:40.266 --> 16:42.867
Get this show on the road.

16:44.270 --> 16:45.870
And sign.

16:47.941 --> 16:49.941
(fire alarm blaring)
What is that?

16:49.943 --> 16:51.376
I think it's the fire alarm.

16:51.378 --> 16:52.610
He's right!

16:52.612 --> 16:53.978
Fire! Get out of the way!

16:53.980 --> 16:56.280
Everybody run out!

16:56.282 --> 16:57.382
ETHAN: <i>The latch is broken.
I can't...</i>

16:57.384 --> 16:58.383
Yeah, I think we need to open

16:58.385 --> 16:59.617
the whole door, don't you think?

16:59.619 --> 17:01.953
Come on. Well, that's
what I'm trying to do.

17:01.955 --> 17:04.122
Get it... put that thing in there. No.
Why is this... It's the latch.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.289
ETHAN: Well, because...
I can't get out.

17:05.291 --> 17:06.457
What you guys doing?

17:07.794 --> 17:10.962
Oh. We're going fishing.
Right now?

17:10.964 --> 17:13.498
Mom... stay out of this.
Excuse me?

17:13.500 --> 17:15.466
All right, she got us.
We're not going fishing.

17:15.468 --> 17:17.568
That was easy. All right, what
are you guys actually doing?

17:17.570 --> 17:18.836
We're heading out of town
for a bit.

17:18.838 --> 17:20.405
Let things cool off around here.

17:20.407 --> 17:22.173
Uh, no.
No, you're not doing that.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.975
Mom, we've been all around this.

17:23.977 --> 17:25.810
We don't have time
to catch you up.

17:25.812 --> 17:27.311
You're not running,
either of you.

17:27.313 --> 17:28.813
Put it down. Right now. Come on.

17:28.815 --> 17:31.482
Put it down. Okay.

17:31.484 --> 17:33.818
You are gonna stay here, you're
gonna pay Zack Landsman back,

17:33.820 --> 17:35.920
and you are never
going to gamble again.

17:35.922 --> 17:38.656
BOTH: What?! That was not an
unreasonable thing to say.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.858
And you, sir,
are gonna stay here

17:40.860 --> 17:42.780
and you're gonna
fight this thing.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.029
I buy that.

17:45.031 --> 17:47.165
All right, we'll stay.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.833
Great.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.401
This time.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.437
Excuse me?

17:53.706 --> 17:54.939
What are you doing here, Dean?

17:54.941 --> 17:56.240
CHAD: Yeah, what are
you doing here?

17:56.242 --> 17:58.342
It's over.

17:58.344 --> 18:00.344
Zadak.

18:00.346 --> 18:02.013
What?

18:02.015 --> 18:03.614
I screwed up.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.516
I used you.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.952
And you didn't deserve that.

18:07.954 --> 18:09.887
What? I thought this
was all so unimportant

18:09.889 --> 18:13.458
that I could just phone it in,
do the bare minimum

18:13.460 --> 18:16.727
while I figured out
my main story,

18:16.729 --> 18:18.863
but I didn't count on
becoming invested.

18:18.865 --> 18:21.566
Now I know that...

18:21.568 --> 18:24.368
this is my main story.

18:24.370 --> 18:25.536
It is?

18:27.807 --> 18:30.141
Yeah.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.418
What's happening?
Okay, really, dude?

18:40.420 --> 18:41.919
You're gonna make
everyone sit through this?

18:41.921 --> 18:44.088
Just admit it, bro. You're gonna
let this guy off the hook?

18:44.090 --> 18:46.090
He's been after me since day one.
CHAD: Get over it.

18:46.092 --> 18:49.060
That's not what happened. (Echoing):
Dude, every time something comes up...

18:49.062 --> 18:53.164
Oser-off... the hook.
(talking continues faintly)

18:53.166 --> 18:56.067
Day one.

18:56.069 --> 18:58.002
Off... the hook.

18:58.004 --> 18:59.971
After me from day one.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.405
That's it.

19:01.407 --> 19:03.407
Sorry, uh, are you
talking to yourself there?

19:03.409 --> 19:05.776
I got it. I told you he'd figure it out.
He always does.

19:05.778 --> 19:06.911
I got to go. Wait, what?

19:06.913 --> 19:08.079
Zadak, um, uh, I believe in you.

19:08.081 --> 19:10.414
You got this. I don't at all.

19:10.416 --> 19:11.616
Wait, so, what, this wasn't
your main story?

19:11.618 --> 19:12.950
I was hoping it was.

19:12.952 --> 19:14.285
We all were.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.254
Maybe the takeaway
from today is that

19:16.256 --> 19:17.522
sometimes the side story

19:17.524 --> 19:21.025
is as important
as the main story.

19:21.027 --> 19:22.093
Then why are you leaving? Ugh!

19:22.095 --> 19:23.594
All right!

19:23.596 --> 19:25.636
It's not as important
as the main story.

19:26.766 --> 19:28.499
But it's close. God!

19:28.501 --> 19:30.735
(door opens, closes)

19:36.342 --> 19:37.642
Uh, I'm sorry about that,
Mr. Manler.

19:37.644 --> 19:38.976
I'm not sure, uh, what happened.

19:38.978 --> 19:40.278
I think I might have an idea.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.479
It was the toaster.

19:41.481 --> 19:43.114
Someone left
an onion bagel in there

19:43.116 --> 19:44.949
for way too long.
CLAIRE: Wasn't me.

19:44.951 --> 19:47.118
Mr. Manler? I didn't even
know you had bagels.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.219
It was me.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.122
That was my onion bagel.

19:51.124 --> 19:52.823
Okay. It's not
that big of a deal.

19:52.825 --> 19:54.292
I never leave things
in toasters for too long.

19:54.294 --> 19:55.993
Stewart? I usually sync my watch

19:55.995 --> 19:57.862
with the timer so that
when I'm in the office...

19:57.864 --> 19:59.163
CLAIRE: You do? Nothing burns.

19:59.165 --> 20:00.631
Maybe Dean was right.

20:00.633 --> 20:03.634
Maybe he did rub off on me.

20:03.636 --> 20:06.337
That's it. That's my side thing
with Dean. I got it.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.673
You got it from "rubbed off on me"?
What?

20:08.675 --> 20:10.875
Mr. Manler...

20:10.877 --> 20:13.010
we'll see you in court.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.011
DEAN: Everyone, stop!

20:14.013 --> 20:17.014
Put those pens down.

20:17.016 --> 20:18.015
No one's holding a pen.

20:18.017 --> 20:19.250
Good, 'cause it's gonna

20:19.252 --> 20:22.320
make this easier, because
we are not settling today.

20:22.322 --> 20:24.188
I know that.
I-I just said that, just now.

20:24.190 --> 20:26.023
Yeah, like, literally
right before you walked in.

20:26.025 --> 20:28.526
Really? You were right.

20:28.528 --> 20:31.229
So, you do have
a little Grinder in you.

20:31.231 --> 20:33.564
I think we got to find
a better way to say that.

20:33.566 --> 20:34.999
But... yeah?

20:35.001 --> 20:37.501
And, Dean, get ready
to get even more excited,

20:37.503 --> 20:38.703
because I figured out
our side thing,

20:38.705 --> 20:40.571
and you're gonna love it.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.707
Todd, you are
so far behind on this.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.375
I figured out
my side thing days ago.

20:44.377 --> 20:46.217
But I... And...

20:47.447 --> 20:49.413
it worked. Worked how?

20:49.415 --> 20:52.216
Mr. Manler, would you
give us the room?

20:52.218 --> 20:53.551
Oh.

20:53.553 --> 20:55.486
Now. Okay. Yeah.
