00:08.920 --> 00:12.360
I have sad news, girls.
Despite all efforts,

00:12.360 --> 00:15.240
I have no alternative
but to finalise the sale

00:15.240 --> 00:17.840
of Malory Towers to Mr Thomas.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.560
Today is our last day.

00:23.360 --> 00:25.160
He intends to knock down
the building,

00:25.160 --> 00:26.640
so the school must close.

00:26.640 --> 00:29.840
He arrives at 11 to sign
the contract.

00:31.280 --> 00:35.280
Please, be on your best
behaviour

00:35.280 --> 00:37.160
and make me proud.

00:37.160 --> 00:38.360
He can't.

00:38.360 --> 00:39.760
There must be something we can do.

00:39.760 --> 00:41.040
I know this is upsetting.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.400
The building may close, but
remember,

00:45.400 --> 00:49.080
the friends you've made
at Malory Towers

00:49.080 --> 00:51.720
are yours for life.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.680
Will you be opening somewhere else?

00:54.680 --> 00:56.840
I hope so. Yes.

00:56.840 --> 00:59.320
But that won't be possible
for some years to come.

01:00.960 --> 01:02.040
I'm sorry,

01:02.040 --> 01:05.480
I've let you down,
but you have also

01:05.480 --> 01:06.800
let yourselves down.

01:07.840 --> 01:09.920
You haven't lived
up to the standards we set

01:09.920 --> 01:12.640
Malory Towers Girls,
and this must be set right

01:12.640 --> 01:15.320
before you leave the school.

01:15.320 --> 01:19.280
Ellen was accused of theft -
wrongly -

01:19.280 --> 01:20.920
but we know the real thief

01:20.920 --> 01:24.480
is in the form, in this very room.

01:24.480 --> 01:29.120
The girl responsible must
come forward today.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.920
This is her last chance
to do the honourable thing.

01:32.920 --> 01:37.400
But if she doesn't, and you know
who she is, then you must tell us.

01:37.400 --> 01:39.760
Or you too will be guilty
of helping the thief get away

01:39.760 --> 01:40.960
with her crime.

01:42.880 --> 01:46.800
This is not tale telling,
it is truth telling.

02:13.320 --> 02:15.080
I'll miss this so much.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.320
I'll miss you.

02:21.720 --> 02:23.840
Ron, have you heard the news?

02:23.840 --> 02:26.160
We got our notices last night.

02:26.160 --> 02:27.560
But what will you do?

02:27.560 --> 02:29.280
I'll find something.

02:29.280 --> 02:32.520
I'll write, I promise -
we can still be friends.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.640
Come up to the school later,
say a proper goodbye?

02:38.920 --> 02:40.320
Darrell, wait.

02:41.800 --> 02:43.320
I found this on the beach.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.320
Isn't this Georgina's mirror?
And that's Alicia's.

02:48.320 --> 02:50.080
Why on earth are they on the beach?

02:57.040 --> 02:58.720
SHE SIGHS

02:58.720 --> 03:01.400
There's something I need to...

03:03.600 --> 03:08.000
I need to explain what...
Gwen! What are you doing here?

03:08.000 --> 03:10.840
I'm waiting to say goodbye to Miss
Grayling, thank her for everything

03:10.840 --> 03:11.920
she's done for me.

03:11.920 --> 03:13.200
You are a good sort, Gwen.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.240
I-I am so sorry

03:15.240 --> 03:18.920
I let your mother's parcel
fall yesterday.

03:18.920 --> 03:20.240
I hope you don't get in trouble.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.800
I'd really rather not talk about it.

03:22.800 --> 03:26.880
Come in with us. We're going to give
her our card and Mary-Lou's drawing.

03:26.880 --> 03:29.400
Mr Parker's in there.
I've been waiting ages.

03:29.400 --> 03:30.680
I'll come back later.

03:33.400 --> 03:34.680
DOOR OPENS

03:35.800 --> 03:38.720
Well, don't congratulate me yet,
I've still to pop the question.

03:38.720 --> 03:41.760
"Pop the question"? Does he mean...?
And, Kenneth,

03:41.760 --> 03:45.200
if I can arrange for you to use
the chapel this summer, I will.

03:45.200 --> 03:46.320
Thank you.

03:50.200 --> 03:52.240
SHE GASPS

03:50.200 --> 03:52.240
He does! A wedding.

03:52.240 --> 03:53.960
How romantic.

03:53.960 --> 03:57.640
Mr Parker's getting married!
Well, he kept that under his hat.

03:57.640 --> 03:59.600
Who to, I wonder.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.200
THEY CHUCKLE

04:02.840 --> 04:06.320
I saw the mirror glinting,
and the pen was nearby.

04:06.320 --> 04:10.240
Look! Something else here.

04:13.920 --> 04:17.120
Isn't this the spot where Mary-Lou
fell off the cliff?

04:17.120 --> 04:19.000
That was here?

04:19.000 --> 04:20.800
She's lucky to be alive.

04:20.800 --> 04:23.600
This is where the cliff fell
down and where that cross

04:23.600 --> 04:25.600
of Lady Jane's you're looking
for came down.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.520
Sally, do you recognise this?

04:27.520 --> 04:29.880
Is that the person Mary-Lou
was taking to the post?

04:29.880 --> 04:31.280
Yes, it is.

04:31.280 --> 04:33.120
"Mrs SLM Lacey".

04:33.120 --> 04:38.560
Why would our stolen things
be in Gwen's parcel to her mother?

04:38.560 --> 04:40.080
Let me see.

04:46.240 --> 04:48.880
I don't know
what you're talking about.

04:48.880 --> 04:52.200
Well, my mother and I were victims
of theft, and even if I was

04:52.200 --> 04:54.760
the thief, why would I send
the stolen goods to my mother?

04:54.760 --> 04:57.360
It wasn't you who addressed
the parcel, though, was it?

04:57.360 --> 05:00.320
This is Mary-Lou's handwriting. You
did steal those things, didn't you?

05:00.320 --> 05:02.880
No! Gwen, don't lie! I'm not.

05:03.880 --> 05:06.280
I acquired them, yes, but I didn't
steal.

05:06.280 --> 05:08.040
I planned to give them back to you.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.640
I don't believe you. Why, Gwen?

05:09.640 --> 05:11.120
Why would you take her belongings?

05:11.120 --> 05:12.840
Please don't tell Miss Grayling.

05:12.840 --> 05:14.160
It was a mistake.

05:14.160 --> 05:16.720
You don't understand...
Gwen, you heard Miss Grayling -

05:16.720 --> 05:19.080
if you don't confess yourself,
of course we have to tell.

05:19.080 --> 05:22.120
But first, you must identify
the items so we can return them.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.680
This is Jean's Sewing Kit.

05:25.680 --> 05:27.200
This is my hanky!

05:27.200 --> 05:29.160
I didn't even know it was missing.

05:29.160 --> 05:30.680
Whose is this?

05:30.680 --> 05:33.120
I don't know.
I've never seen that before.

05:33.120 --> 05:36.040
I'll open it.
That'll tell us who.

05:36.040 --> 05:38.600
What? What is it?

05:39.600 --> 05:41.040
Lady Jane Malory?

05:42.160 --> 05:44.680
Oh, my. And this must be Fast Jack.

05:44.680 --> 05:46.520
What was that doing on the beach?

05:46.520 --> 05:48.800
Could it be Lady Jane's treasure?

05:48.800 --> 05:50.960
That sounds like it needs
investigating.

05:50.960 --> 05:53.440
Let's go check the inventory
with Miss Grayling.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.360
You're coming with us, Gwen,
to confess. Come on.

06:09.960 --> 06:12.200
Oh, well, if you think
you're getting your mitts

06:12.200 --> 06:14.360
on my kippers...

06:15.720 --> 06:18.160
Oh, what does it matter now?

06:18.160 --> 06:19.440
There.

06:26.400 --> 06:27.840
So that's your name.

06:30.720 --> 06:32.560
Oh, I suppose it fits.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.120
Matron?

06:32.560 --> 06:34.120
CAT MEOWS

06:34.120 --> 06:37.240
Matron. We've come to collect
our health certificates.

06:37.240 --> 06:38.920
Oh, they're-they're on my desk.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.320
Help yourselves.

06:40.320 --> 06:43.360
Wait, Matron, have you heard
that Mr Park...? Shh!

06:43.360 --> 06:44.840
Nothing.

06:46.080 --> 06:49.440
What? Did you see
how sad she looked?

06:49.440 --> 06:51.960
Malory Towers - it's her life.

06:51.960 --> 06:54.720
I'm sure she knows other people
have exciting things to move onto,

06:54.720 --> 06:57.280
but let's not rub it in.

06:57.280 --> 06:59.000
What will she do when
the school closes?

06:59.000 --> 07:00.480
Is she going to be alone?

07:12.680 --> 07:14.320
KNOCKING AT DOOR

07:12.680 --> 07:14.320
Miss Grayling?

07:14.320 --> 07:16.840
Miss Grayling, may we come in?
Miss Grayling?

07:16.840 --> 07:19.480
It's not right for us to go in,
not if she's not in here.

07:19.480 --> 07:22.200
Desperate times call for desperate
measures. You're right.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.560
I'll just wait outside.

07:31.560 --> 07:33.920
Not on your nelly.
You're not leaving.

07:36.240 --> 07:39.440
Yes! Look, there was a locket
on the inventory of treasures.

07:39.440 --> 07:41.520
Could it be there are other
treasures on the beach?

07:41.520 --> 07:43.520
They would have been washed away
long since.

07:43.520 --> 07:46.240
Except we found the locket right
under where Mary-Lou fell. So?

07:46.240 --> 07:48.640
So what if the cross
and the treasure beneath

07:48.640 --> 07:50.680
it wasn't washed out to sea?

07:50.680 --> 07:54.120
You mean...? It could be lodged
into the side of the cliff.

07:54.120 --> 07:56.720
If it was, when Mary-Lou
fell, her kicking at the cliff face

07:56.720 --> 07:58.000
could have disturbed it.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.680
What if it's all still there?
Mr Thomas arrives at 11 o'clock.

08:00.680 --> 08:03.600
That's 20 minutes. We'll go look for
the other treasures on the beach.

08:03.600 --> 08:06.280
You find Miss Grayling, tell her
that she cannot sign the contract

08:06.280 --> 08:09.080
till we're back. If the jewels are
as valuable as Miss Grayling says,

08:09.080 --> 08:11.560
she won't need to sell.
We could save the school.

08:14.480 --> 08:16.680
Gwen, not so fast.
You're coming with me.

08:16.680 --> 08:19.400
if I'm going to hold off Miss
Grayling from signing,

08:19.400 --> 08:21.880
I'm going to need your wheedling
skills. Wheedling skills?!

08:21.880 --> 08:24.480
Alicia, I've never wheedled in my
entire life.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.400
THEY LAUGH

08:24.480 --> 08:26.400
What?

08:26.400 --> 08:27.920
Come on, Gwen.

08:27.920 --> 08:29.000
Oh...

08:31.520 --> 08:35.040
It's all just so sad,
and poor Matron and Miss Grayling.

08:35.040 --> 08:36.960
They lose their jobs and their home.

08:36.960 --> 08:39.000
I've got a corner of fruitcake left.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.680
Matron loves cake.

08:40.680 --> 08:42.920
I just wish I had time to do
her drawing.

08:45.800 --> 08:47.240
Look.

08:47.240 --> 08:49.600
It can't be.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.880
I don't understand.

08:51.880 --> 08:53.680
Is she possibly...?

08:55.200 --> 08:57.920
Is Matron Mr Parker's sweetheart?!

08:59.840 --> 09:01.760
THEY CHUCKLE INCREDULOUSLY

09:01.760 --> 09:04.680
Here, Kenny. Here, kitty kitty.

09:05.960 --> 09:07.800
Don't worry, Ellen, we will find
him.

09:07.800 --> 09:11.600
We must. If the school is closing,
we can't just abandon him here.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.320
Jean, Ellen, we need you.

09:13.320 --> 09:16.400
But we need... Listen, we think we
found Lady Jane's missing treasure.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.880
What? So Miss Grayling
might not have to sell the school.

09:18.880 --> 09:21.400
Mr Thomas arrives to 11,
Alicia is asking Miss Grayling

09:21.400 --> 09:22.880
to hold off signing till we get
back,

09:22.880 --> 09:24.240
but see if you can stall them too,

09:24.240 --> 09:25.560
do whatever it takes.

09:32.200 --> 09:33.600
We've looked everywhere.

09:33.600 --> 09:38.640
Her quarters, the staffroom,
the garden. Oh, well, never mind.

09:38.640 --> 09:40.600
You don't want to find her, do you?

09:40.600 --> 09:42.000
Of course I do.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.760
You'd rather the school close,
so then you don't have to confess.

09:45.760 --> 09:47.960
But I'm going to make you own up
no matter what.

09:47.960 --> 09:49.920
You don't deserve mercy.

09:49.920 --> 09:52.320
You're so mean.

09:52.320 --> 09:55.160
I'm glad Miss Grayling decided
against the final assembly.

09:55.160 --> 09:58.000
You'd have probably dragged me in
there and... No assembly.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.560
The hall! You're right.

09:59.560 --> 10:02.200
That's where she is!
Quick, it's the one place...

10:02.200 --> 10:03.920
SHE SIGHS

10:06.640 --> 10:08.520
Maybe he's not coming.

10:08.520 --> 10:09.840
Maybe it's all off.

10:11.280 --> 10:12.760
There he is.

10:12.760 --> 10:16.200
Oh, no, it's a squirrel.

10:12.760 --> 10:16.200
ENGINE REVS

10:16.200 --> 10:18.720
No, it is him. Look.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.720
RON: What are we going to do?

10:24.520 --> 10:26.360
There's nothing here.

10:26.360 --> 10:28.320
Darrell? Sally?

10:28.320 --> 10:30.960
What about over there?

10:30.960 --> 10:32.320
Anything?

10:32.320 --> 10:33.760
It was always a long shot.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.760
We better go.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.360
Wait, what's that?

10:52.080 --> 10:54.920
If it was Lady Jane's, the jewels
are long gone.

11:01.400 --> 11:04.440
Hang about -
there's a secret compartment.

11:06.080 --> 11:07.440
THEY LAUGH

11:07.440 --> 11:11.040
Pearls? Rubies? Sapphires, emeralds?

11:11.040 --> 11:12.720
It must be worth thousands.

11:13.640 --> 11:16.320
Quick, you should get back.

11:16.320 --> 11:19.600
Maybe we can save the school...
If we get to Miss Grayling in time.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.480
Thank you, Ron. Thank you.

11:31.800 --> 11:36.600
# Four tall towers teach how
to strive

11:36.600 --> 11:39.000
# To be women the world can lean on

11:39.000 --> 11:41.160
# Women who will thrive

11:41.160 --> 11:45.040
# The games of our girlhood
will stand in good stead

11:45.040 --> 11:47.360
# The lessons we learn today

11:47.360 --> 11:49.480
# Will forge our lives ahead

11:49.480 --> 11:52.280
# And with faded eyesight

11:52.280 --> 11:54.160
# We'll look back across the years

11:54.160 --> 11:56.200
# We'll salute those tall towers

11:56.200 --> 11:58.480
# Those golden days as girls

11:58.480 --> 12:02.120
# Your clifftop days
and your golden hours

12:02.120 --> 12:06.160
# Will guide us through
our future years

12:06.160 --> 12:09.960
# Hand in hand, we'll lead
a legacy... #

12:09.960 --> 12:11.480
Miss Grayling! Miss Grayling!

12:11.480 --> 12:13.480
Good gracious, girls, is there an
emergency?

12:13.480 --> 12:15.640
Yes, Darrell and Sally have found
the treasure.

12:15.640 --> 12:17.640
Well, at least they think they have.

12:17.640 --> 12:19.920
It's on the beach.
They're getting it now.

12:19.920 --> 12:22.880
Don't sign the contract. Oh, girls,
the treasure was lost centuries ago.

12:22.880 --> 12:25.360
It won't be on the beach.
It is! We have proof.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.640
Where's the locket?

12:28.640 --> 12:31.480
Erm, in the dorm or in the study.

12:31.480 --> 12:33.480
Please, just wait while we get it.

12:33.480 --> 12:37.760
Alicia, I understand why
you want to delay the inevitable,

12:37.760 --> 12:41.520
but these tactics are beneath you
and they must stop now.

12:46.920 --> 12:48.960
Is there a reason Mr Thomas is late?

12:50.760 --> 12:53.600
What a lovely...motor car.

12:53.600 --> 12:57.320
The shiny bits are very shiny.

12:57.320 --> 12:58.960
Oh, it's hot.

12:58.960 --> 13:00.720
Oh, Mr Thomas, I think I burned
my hand.

13:00.720 --> 13:02.600
No, I really have burnt my hand.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.840
Perhaps you should go
to the sanatorium.

13:04.840 --> 13:06.200
Now, I have somewhere to be.

13:06.200 --> 13:09.600
No. Excuse me, I'm going inside.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.240
No, wait, Mr Thomas, please.

13:11.240 --> 13:12.800
Your coa...

13:11.240 --> 13:12.800
FABRIC TEARING

13:12.800 --> 13:15.440
..coat is stuck in the car door.

13:16.920 --> 13:19.560
What is it about this school
and my suits?

13:19.560 --> 13:21.480
What is the meaning of this, girls?

13:21.480 --> 13:23.520
Welcome, Mr Thomas.

13:23.520 --> 13:24.840
Shall we go inside?

13:37.760 --> 13:44.280
So I, the undersigned, sign
ownership of Malory Towers

13:44.280 --> 13:46.560
to Mr Francis Thomas.

13:48.440 --> 13:53.240
Miss Grayling, stop, don't sign!
We found the treasure! Enough.

13:53.240 --> 13:55.440
I've made my position
on this quite clear.

13:55.440 --> 13:59.560
No, please, look.
We have Lady Jane's jewels.

13:59.560 --> 14:01.480
Someone's raided the costume trunk.

14:01.480 --> 14:04.080
They're real. Miss Grayling doesn't
want to sell our school,

14:04.080 --> 14:05.880
and these means she doesn't have to.

14:05.880 --> 14:09.360
Girls, please don't talk
to Mr Thomas like that.

14:09.360 --> 14:12.400
Thank you. Now, Miss Grayling,
if we could sign.

14:26.520 --> 14:30.840
Darrell, Sally, it was wrong of you
to go to the beach

14:30.840 --> 14:32.160
without permission.

14:34.320 --> 14:36.160
But thank goodness you did.

14:36.160 --> 14:37.400
Thank you, girls.

14:41.360 --> 14:44.280
Look here. Could we get back to
business?

14:44.280 --> 14:48.440
Mr Thomas, I'm afraid I've changed
my mind.

14:48.440 --> 14:52.080
I won't be signing
the sale agreement after all.

14:52.080 --> 14:56.520
Malory Towers will remain
standing. So it's real, then.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.720
It really is the Malory treasure.

14:58.720 --> 15:01.240
Oh, yes, of that I have no doubt.

15:03.360 --> 15:06.600
DARRELL: We actually did it!
SALLY: I can't believe it.

15:06.600 --> 15:09.280
Darrell, Sally...
That's so amazing.

15:09.280 --> 15:11.280
..I hope my help finding
Miss Grayling

15:11.280 --> 15:13.000
will help you to look more
favourably

15:13.000 --> 15:14.280
upon my error of judgment.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.360
It's not up to us, Gwen. Hm.

15:16.360 --> 15:19.520
Miss Grayling is the one who decides
if you come back next year.

15:24.480 --> 15:28.000
I apologise, with all my heart,
for any inconvenience.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.520
And, of course,
I'll pay any legal fees incurred.

15:33.320 --> 15:36.320
Now, where's my daughter? Georgina?

15:40.080 --> 15:42.800
Goodbye, Miss Grayling.
Goodbye, Georgina.

15:42.800 --> 15:46.000
I do hope you'll be back, perhaps
with your own daughters.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.920
Come on, then, girl.
Let's not waste any more time here.

15:48.920 --> 15:51.720
Georgina! Your mirror!

15:51.720 --> 15:56.400
Oh, I wondered where that had got
to. Thank you.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.640
I didn't realise how much
I was going to miss this place

15:58.640 --> 15:59.680
till right now.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.360
Come along.

16:09.360 --> 16:11.440
The sooner we're out of here,
the better.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.840
Georgina, shall we?

16:24.440 --> 16:25.720
ENGINE STARTS

16:33.840 --> 16:35.760
I suppose you're going to expel me.

16:39.560 --> 16:41.240
Well, you have admitted your
offence...

16:42.280 --> 16:44.040
..and that is in your favour.

16:45.120 --> 16:51.040
But, Gwen, taking other people's
belongings is a very serious matter.

16:55.560 --> 16:57.800
I'm not a Malory Towers girl...

16:57.800 --> 16:59.320
..am I?

16:59.320 --> 17:00.880
SHE SNIFFLES

17:00.880 --> 17:02.840
I don't deserve to be here.

17:02.840 --> 17:06.280
Do you want to be
a Malory Towers girl? Yes.

17:06.280 --> 17:08.120
More than anything I do.

17:08.120 --> 17:09.840
And do you have the qualities?

17:11.720 --> 17:13.120
Sometimes.

17:14.680 --> 17:18.600
I can do the right thing,
like when I rescued Mary-Lou.

17:21.680 --> 17:24.120
But I find it difficult
to keep it up all the time.

17:25.360 --> 17:30.880
I want to, I do. I still believe
in you, Gwen, and I would give

17:30.880 --> 17:33.760
you a second chance. Thank you.

17:33.760 --> 17:37.040
But, ultimately, now that the school
is staying open...

17:38.280 --> 17:40.600
..it must be in the hands
of your form.

17:40.600 --> 17:45.320
Oh, no. Oh, yes. It is they who'll
be sharing a classroom

17:45.320 --> 17:47.560
and a dormitory with you.

17:47.560 --> 17:49.640
You must tell THEM why you stole.

17:51.520 --> 17:55.600
And they will decide whether you're
still one of them or not.

17:55.600 --> 17:56.960
SHE SNIFFLES

17:59.200 --> 18:00.440
LAUGHTER

18:00.440 --> 18:04.480
GIRLS CHATTER
BELL RINGS

18:07.280 --> 18:08.840
So there's a telegram.

18:08.840 --> 18:10.400
I hope it's not bad news.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.080
It's from my parents.

18:12.080 --> 18:14.680
I suppose they've changed
their minds about the halls.

18:14.680 --> 18:16.440
Perhaps I'll be staying after all.

18:23.640 --> 18:26.600
My old skating coach is managing
the Canadian junior team.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.640
They've offered me a trial.

18:29.640 --> 18:31.760
That's marvellous, isn't it?

18:33.520 --> 18:36.320
But if I get in, I'll be gone
a whole year.

18:36.320 --> 18:39.600
Representing Canada - it's amazing.

18:39.600 --> 18:42.360
I'll miss you all so much.

18:42.360 --> 18:44.240
Even me?

18:44.240 --> 18:46.320
Gwen, where have you been?

18:47.560 --> 18:49.920
Went to Miss Grayling, I confessed.

18:51.080 --> 18:53.040
Well, what did she say?

18:57.000 --> 18:59.200
She said it was up to you all,

18:59.200 --> 19:00.600
if you'll let me stay.

19:01.920 --> 19:03.920
If we are to make a decision,

19:03.920 --> 19:05.800
we need to understand
why you did it.

19:07.560 --> 19:11.440
I started stealing things because
my father stole my pocket money.

19:12.680 --> 19:14.320
Why didn't you tell us?

19:14.320 --> 19:16.040
We would have helped you out.

19:16.040 --> 19:18.080
I just couldn't.

19:18.080 --> 19:19.400
I was ashamed.

19:19.400 --> 19:20.800
But you weren't ashamed to steal?

19:20.800 --> 19:23.200
I didn't really think of it
as stealing.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.000
None of you really like me.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.440
That's not true.

19:26.440 --> 19:29.760
Sometimes we don't like the things
you do, but you can change that.

19:32.600 --> 19:36.080
I-I saw the pretty things
and how much you love them,

19:36.080 --> 19:38.640
and somehow I...

19:42.040 --> 19:43.920
..I felt less lonely,

19:43.920 --> 19:46.400
knowing you special
things were in my trunk.

19:46.400 --> 19:48.080
It's really sad.

19:48.080 --> 19:49.280
It's really bad.

19:50.320 --> 19:52.400
I suppose it's a mixture
of both, really.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.440
Go on, Gwen.

19:56.560 --> 19:58.840
I did try and give
you your things back.

19:58.840 --> 20:01.960
I managed it with your lucky
coin,

20:01.960 --> 20:06.560
but it was so hard, so I sent
them away.

20:09.640 --> 20:11.040
Your handkerchief.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.240
I never meant to keep all
of your things.

20:25.240 --> 20:27.160
What about Ellen?

20:27.160 --> 20:28.680
I never stole anything from Ellen.

20:28.680 --> 20:30.400
You did.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.800
You took my reputation
and my good name.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.960
I'm sorry, Ellen.
Really, truly, I am.

20:47.320 --> 20:50.520
I expect you all hate me more
than you did before

20:50.520 --> 20:53.320
and none of you are going to want
me to stay here.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.120
We'll put it to a vote.

20:55.120 --> 20:57.120
I can't bear it.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.840
I know what I deserve.

21:00.120 --> 21:01.440
I'll just go.

21:03.320 --> 21:05.320
Good riddance. Wait.

21:09.320 --> 21:12.480
Alicia was forgiven
for accusing me of being the thief.

21:14.760 --> 21:17.760
I was forgiven for...for cheating.

21:21.040 --> 21:23.920
Doesn't Gwen deserve
a second chance, too?

21:27.280 --> 21:28.960
I agree with Ellen.

21:28.960 --> 21:30.960
Yes, me too. Me three.

21:33.240 --> 21:34.760
And I agree.

21:37.240 --> 21:39.840
Well, it shouldn't be down to me,
should it?

21:39.840 --> 21:42.160
As I'm going
to be going next year?

21:42.160 --> 21:45.480
So, if you're all in agreement...

21:45.480 --> 21:47.000
Gwen...

21:49.320 --> 21:51.040
..we all want you to stay.

21:51.040 --> 21:53.640
But you have to turn over
a new leaf.

21:53.640 --> 21:57.240
I will, I promise. Nothing crossed.

22:00.560 --> 22:03.000
GIRLS CHATTER

22:23.000 --> 22:25.400
I hope you put your bathers
in your night case.

22:25.400 --> 22:27.880
The first thing we'll do when we get
to mine is go for a dip.

22:27.880 --> 22:31.240
Are you sure you're all right
about Gwen?

22:31.240 --> 22:34.880
It's not that. I just... I wish
I'd found my cat.

22:34.880 --> 22:38.280
Who will feed him over the summer?
Let's go find him.

22:38.280 --> 22:40.880
I'm not getting on that coach till
we do.

22:40.880 --> 22:42.760
THEY LAUGH

22:40.880 --> 22:42.760
Let's check the grounds.

22:43.880 --> 22:46.200
What is this? A mother's meeting?

22:46.200 --> 22:48.760
I'm afraid you'll be on your own
these halls, matron.

22:48.760 --> 22:50.880
Don't miss me, will you?

22:50.880 --> 22:52.920
No chance of that.

22:52.920 --> 22:54.600
I have company of my own
this summer.

22:54.600 --> 22:56.240
Company, Matron?

22:56.240 --> 23:00.160
I suppose you could say that Kenny
and I have come to an understanding.

23:02.480 --> 23:04.080
Told you!

23:04.080 --> 23:06.640
You heard Miss Grayling
call Mr Parker Kenneth.

23:06.640 --> 23:09.920
I was right - Matron and Kenny.

23:09.920 --> 23:11.800
THEY LAUGH

23:11.800 --> 23:15.440
Now, the coach will be here soon.
Come along.

23:17.600 --> 23:19.720
THEY LAUGH INCREDULOUSLY

23:24.000 --> 23:25.440
Here, kitty kitty!

23:25.440 --> 23:26.800
Oh!

23:26.800 --> 23:29.640
I wish I hadn't already found myself
another position. We were lucky

23:29.640 --> 23:31.480
to have you for as long as we did.

23:31.480 --> 23:33.480
Oh, and I see someone
who's even luckier.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.840
Take care. Bye.

23:36.840 --> 23:40.200
Poppy! Absolutely stunning.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.440
Oh, my goodness.

23:42.440 --> 23:43.960
Did he just kiss her?

23:43.960 --> 23:45.920
She is a sweetheart, Irene.

23:45.920 --> 23:48.000
But aren't you his intended, Matron?

23:50.480 --> 23:53.880
We saw him propose on one knee.
Ha-ha-ha, oh, child,

23:53.880 --> 23:56.360
you'll be the death of me.

23:56.360 --> 24:00.160
I was trying to coax the cat
from under the cabinet.

24:00.160 --> 24:02.120
Mr Parker was helping me
get him out.

24:02.120 --> 24:04.240
Oh...

24:04.240 --> 24:07.120
I'd choose a cat over a man any day.

24:07.120 --> 24:11.040
You said Kenny. Kenny!
You found my cat.

24:11.040 --> 24:13.400
Oh, Matron, you found him.
Thank goodness!

24:13.400 --> 24:15.840
So you've been looking
after the cat all year?

24:15.840 --> 24:19.800
Well, with your permission,
I'll look after him and he'll look

24:19.800 --> 24:21.280
after me this summer.

24:21.280 --> 24:23.880
SHE GASPS

24:21.280 --> 24:23.880
Yes!

24:25.400 --> 24:27.840
DARRELL: Goodbye, Malory Towers.

24:27.840 --> 24:32.480
Thank you for the adventures
and see you next term.

24:32.480 --> 24:34.920
THEY LAUGH

24:39.840 --> 24:41.880
# Four tall towers

24:41.880 --> 24:43.600
# That train by esteem

24:43.600 --> 24:46.800
# Of the cliff corner view
of the school of our dreams

24:46.800 --> 24:48.560
# We came here as girls

24:48.560 --> 24:50.400
# To be women of the world

24:50.400 --> 24:52.840
# And we'll do so with prosperity. #

24:52.840 --> 24:54.240
LAUGHTER
