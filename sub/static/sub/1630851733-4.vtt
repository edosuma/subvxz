00:15.768 --> 00:18.401
You were so eager and willing
to hit your marks.

00:18.401 --> 00:19.668
You made me laugh.

00:19.668 --> 00:21.068
You hit all your jokes.

00:21.068 --> 00:23.168
Adriana, con-drag-ulations.

00:23.168 --> 00:25.501
You are the winner
of this week's maxi-challenge.

00:25.501 --> 00:28.368
Synthia Kiss, shantay you stay.

00:28.368 --> 00:31.368

00:37.168 --> 00:38.901
We've got
no fucking hands to hold.

00:38.901 --> 00:39.868
Oh, my God.

00:39.868 --> 00:43.701
What is going on?

00:43.701 --> 00:46.434
"Just letting you guys know
that I love y'all,

00:46.434 --> 00:48.834
"and you should be
so proud of yourself.

00:48.834 --> 00:50.401
"Back to being a bitch.
[all laugh]

00:50.401 --> 00:51.268

00:51.268 --> 00:55.101
"JK. I'm so horny.

00:55.101 --> 00:57.001
-Steph."
-That's funny.

00:57.001 --> 00:58.868
I just lip synced for my life.

00:58.868 --> 01:01.234
It just feels very real
all of a sudden.

01:01.234 --> 01:03.834
This is a competition,

01:03.834 --> 01:07.068
so it makes me feel gratitude
that I'm still here,

01:07.068 --> 01:09.701
but also just a ready spirit
for whatever is thrown at me.

01:09.701 --> 01:15.034
Stephanie, I'm sad,
because it's a sister that's leaving us.

01:15.034 --> 01:16.834
But at the same time,
it's exciting,

01:16.834 --> 01:19.234
because here I am,
still in the game.

01:19.234 --> 01:22.701
Synthia, how did you feel
about lip syncing?

01:22.701 --> 01:25.501
It was intense,
but I am very proud of myself.

01:25.501 --> 01:26.868
You should be.

01:26.868 --> 01:28.501
You were so beautiful up there.

01:28.501 --> 01:29.601
Thank you.

01:29.601 --> 01:31.168
When you look through the ball,
it almost hit her.

01:31.168 --> 01:33.101
When you threw the ball, baby!

01:33.101 --> 01:34.201
How close was it?

01:34.201 --> 01:35.901
The ball slapped her face.

01:35.901 --> 01:37.234
[slowed down audio]
Slapped her face.

01:37.234 --> 01:39.601
Slapped her face.

01:39.601 --> 01:41.934
-Whoo!
-It was, like, this close.

01:41.934 --> 01:43.001
It was, like,
borderline violence.

01:43.001 --> 01:44.701

but I am coming for you.

and I feel powerful.

02:02.701 --> 02:06.268
Oh, my God, so I feel that it's time
to take this off, ladies.

02:08.068 --> 02:09.334
Get me outta drag!

02:09.334 --> 02:11.834
Top nine, fuckers.

02:11.834 --> 02:14.168
Pythia, it is so good
to see you again.

02:14.168 --> 02:15.434
I'm right here!

02:15.434 --> 02:18.001
This competition is heating up,

with a nose like that,

05:54.068 --> 05:55.868

I'm just shocked
it didn't grow nine inches

you think she's gonna end up

where you got your name.

06:47.101 --> 06:50.034

your silhouette is a straight line,

06:50.034 --> 06:52.001

is a circle.

08:14.001 --> 08:15.834

-You know what they say.

08:15.834 --> 08:17.068
You can take the girl
out of L.A.,

08:17.068 --> 08:18.668
but it takes three to six months

08:18.668 --> 08:20.868

out of the girl.

09:25.434 --> 09:28.501
Because it's time
to separate the media rights

09:28.501 --> 09:30.868
from the media wrongs.

09:30.868 --> 09:33.701
For this week's maxi-challenge,

09:33.701 --> 09:35.934
we'll be playing...

09:35.934 --> 09:37.068
the Snatch Game.

09:37.068 --> 09:39.101
[cheering]

09:39.101 --> 09:41.034
Oh, shit!

09:41.034 --> 09:42.768
Snatch Game, snatch.

09:42.768 --> 09:45.068
Sorry, I had a flashback.

09:45.068 --> 09:46.168
Come on, Celine.

09:46.168 --> 09:48.368
[all laugh]

09:48.368 --> 09:49.501
You know the rules.

09:49.501 --> 09:52.368
Give us your best
celebrity impersonation.

09:52.368 --> 09:53.901
But most importantly,

09:53.901 --> 09:58.334
fill in those blanks
and take us to the laugh bank.

09:58.334 --> 10:02.201
Racers, start your engines,

10:02.201 --> 10:04.068
and may
the least shitty one win.

10:04.068 --> 10:06.101
[all cheer]

10:06.101 --> 10:07.768
-Bye!
-Bye!

10:10.534 --> 10:13.201
Today is Snatch Game!

10:13.201 --> 10:15.901
The Snatch Game
is an impersonation challenge,

10:15.901 --> 10:18.068
but it's also
an improv challenge.

10:18.068 --> 10:19.168
Oh.

10:19.168 --> 10:20.434
-Oh, wow.
-Oh, wow.

10:20.434 --> 10:22.168
It's a comedy challenge
most of all.

10:22.168 --> 10:23.201
You have to be funny.

10:23.201 --> 10:25.201
This is the one
that I came here to do,

10:25.201 --> 10:26.934
and I'm ready to win.

10:26.934 --> 10:28.068
Are you guys ready?

10:28.068 --> 10:30.068
I honestly don't know
who's doing who.

10:30.068 --> 10:32.168
Yeah, I'm not really sure
who is who either.

10:32.168 --> 10:34.501
You know what? Like,
I'm not a celebrity person.

10:34.501 --> 10:35.368
Me, too, yeah.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.068
Sometimes that's actually
good for Snatch Game.

10:37.068 --> 10:38.834
Yes, because you have
your own opinion of it.

10:38.834 --> 10:41.068
Yeah, because you can create
whatever the hell you want.

10:41.068 --> 10:43.601
I feel like this competition
has been so flip-floppy.

10:43.601 --> 10:45.268
I literally went from the top
to the bottom

10:45.268 --> 10:46.368
in, like, the snap of a finger.

10:46.368 --> 10:48.168
So we just have no idea.

10:48.168 --> 10:49.901
Snatch Game makes me feel
like I'm competing.

10:49.901 --> 10:51.034
-Yeah.
-You know what I mean?

10:51.034 --> 10:52.401
-This is Drag Race.
-Yeah.

10:52.401 --> 10:53.768
The Snatch Game is honestly

10:53.768 --> 10:56.034
the most iconic part
of Drag Race,

10:56.034 --> 10:59.334
because a lot of
the impersonations that win

10:59.334 --> 11:03.768
go on throughout the drag performer's
career forever.

11:03.768 --> 11:06.101
I'm back, my dream queens.

11:06.101 --> 11:08.234
Hello.

11:08.234 --> 11:10.034
Now let me see those snatches.

11:10.034 --> 11:11.068
Oh!

11:11.068 --> 11:13.101
-Smell my finger.
-[laughs]

11:13.101 --> 11:14.234
Hi, Icesis.

11:14.234 --> 11:15.868
Hi, Brooke Lynn.

11:15.868 --> 11:18.068
So tell me about who you're thinking
for Snatch Game.

11:18.068 --> 11:22.834
I've decided to go with
a woman named La Veneno.

11:22.834 --> 11:25.201
Yes, of course.

11:25.201 --> 11:27.168
-She's an icon.
-She is, like, yeah.

11:27.168 --> 11:31.001
La Veneno is a gay icon

11:31.001 --> 11:33.768
from the early nineties
in Spain.

11:33.768 --> 11:35.368
She was on
a lot of television shows,

11:35.368 --> 11:36.734
she had music.

11:36.734 --> 11:40.234
Just, like, on a personal note,
my drag mother is trans.

11:40.234 --> 11:41.101
Uh-huh.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.734
So I just have,
like, a connection.

11:42.734 --> 11:45.701
I've been raised by,
like, a pack of trans women.

11:45.701 --> 11:47.168
I think this is
a great character,

11:47.168 --> 11:50.934
and I love that you are
paying homage to a trans icon.

11:50.934 --> 11:52.034
-Have fun.
-Thank you.

11:52.034 --> 11:54.068
-That's what it's all about.
-The pleasure's all mine.

11:54.068 --> 11:55.334
Thank you. Bye, baby.

11:55.334 --> 11:57.034
Bye. [laughs]

11:57.034 --> 11:59.034
Hi, Pythia.

11:59.034 --> 12:00.168
Hello, Brooke.

12:00.168 --> 12:01.234
Tell me who you're gonna do?

12:01.234 --> 12:04.501
My very first choice
would be Grimes.

12:04.501 --> 12:05.501
She's a Canadian singer,

12:05.501 --> 12:08.068
but she's also
the partner of Elon Musk.

12:08.068 --> 12:09.868
Is this something
that's in your wheelhouse?

12:11.201 --> 12:12.668
What's a wheelhouse?

12:12.668 --> 12:14.601
The realm of what you do
in drag.

12:14.601 --> 12:16.168
Not really.

12:16.168 --> 12:18.101
It's gonna be a little different
from what I do,

12:18.101 --> 12:20.001
but I feel like
I can really build off of it.

12:20.001 --> 12:21.701
I just wanna have a little fun.

12:21.701 --> 12:22.768
Yeah, I can't wait
to see how it turns out.

12:22.768 --> 12:24.901
-Thank you, Brooke.
-Thank you, Pythia.

12:24.901 --> 12:28.068
-Adriana.
-Hello, hello.

12:28.068 --> 12:29.068
I love an animal print.

12:29.068 --> 12:31.701
Now, I don't want you
to tell me who you're doing.

12:31.701 --> 12:33.334
I want you to show me.

12:33.334 --> 12:35.168
I don't want why,
it seems so obvious

12:35.168 --> 12:36.901
if I have this beautiful hair.

12:36.901 --> 12:38.001
Oh, Sofa?

12:38.001 --> 12:39.268
Sofa Vergara.

12:39.268 --> 12:40.834
-I love it.
-Thank you.

12:40.834 --> 12:42.234
She's also from Colombia.

12:42.234 --> 12:44.168
She's also from Colombia.
I love her.

12:44.168 --> 12:46.868
I'm gonna use my accent
as a strength

12:46.868 --> 12:50.501
and just turn it
a little bit more cochina,

12:50.501 --> 12:52.001
something, like...

12:52.001 --> 12:53.101
-Yeah.
-You know?

12:53.101 --> 12:54.168
I love that you're confident,

12:54.168 --> 12:56.201
and you've just gotta commit
to it and make us laugh.

12:56.201 --> 12:57.101
Certainly I will.

12:57.101 --> 12:58.234
Thank you, baby.

12:59.868 --> 13:02.601
Hello, hello, bonjour.

13:02.601 --> 13:04.101
Hi, Suki.

13:04.101 --> 13:05.234
Who do we have here?

13:05.234 --> 13:09.001
Okay, so we have an artiste.

13:09.001 --> 13:10.768
-It's Yoko Ono.
-[gasps]

13:10.768 --> 13:12.101
Can you give me a little Yoko?

13:12.101 --> 13:13.201
Yes, of course.

13:13.201 --> 13:16.034
♪ Aah ♪

13:16.034 --> 13:19.001
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

13:19.001 --> 13:20.768
♪ Aah ♪

13:20.768 --> 13:22.868
Ugh, ugh.

13:22.868 --> 13:24.034
And there's more.

13:24.034 --> 13:25.368
[laughs]

13:25.368 --> 13:26.568
What I like about you

13:26.568 --> 13:27.768
is that you don't
take yourself seriously,

13:27.768 --> 13:29.834
but you take the work seriously,

13:29.834 --> 13:31.201
and that's a very important thing
to separate,

13:31.201 --> 13:32.701
which makes me excited
for Snatch Game.

13:32.701 --> 13:34.034
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

13:35.501 --> 13:37.101
-Hey, Brooke.
-Hi!

13:37.101 --> 13:38.101
How are you?

13:38.101 --> 13:41.068
I am good.

13:41.068 --> 13:43.068
Give me a little bit
of your character,

13:43.068 --> 13:43.934
and I'm gonna try to guess.

13:43.934 --> 13:46.168
Bitch, I love glitter
and cocaine.

13:46.168 --> 13:47.501
[laughs]

13:47.501 --> 13:49.768
I have no idea who that is.

13:49.768 --> 13:52.068
I am doing Ms. Leslie Jones.

13:52.068 --> 13:53.501
That's a great personality
to do.

13:53.501 --> 13:54.601
I think so.

13:54.601 --> 13:57.268
I'm very quiet, actually,

13:57.268 --> 13:59.668
when I'm at home and by myself.

13:59.668 --> 14:02.201
This gets me
to show my personality

14:02.201 --> 14:03.834
when I'm with my friends.

14:03.834 --> 14:05.034
That part
that's kind of raunchy,

14:05.034 --> 14:07.568
that part that's just
kind of silly and stupid

14:07.568 --> 14:10.168
and just loves to have fun.

14:10.168 --> 14:11.434
You're on fucking Drag Race.

14:11.434 --> 14:14.101
Bitch, have fun, goddamn it!

14:14.101 --> 14:15.001
I couldn't agree more.

14:15.001 --> 14:16.068
Well, it's so good
to finally talk to you.

14:16.068 --> 14:17.401
I hope it's the first of many.

14:17.401 --> 14:19.401
-Thank you.
-Bye.

14:19.401 --> 14:20.668
Hello, hi, Gia.

14:20.668 --> 14:21.534
Hi, Brooke Lynn.

14:21.534 --> 14:24.234
Tell me about
who you are thinking.

14:24.234 --> 14:26.168
Okay. We've got the breasteses.

14:26.168 --> 14:27.201
-Thinking Anna Faris.
-Uh-huh.

14:27.201 --> 14:30.168
That voice that she does
where she exhales a lot,

14:30.168 --> 14:32.334
she's a little quirky
and awkward.

14:32.334 --> 14:36.668
And then my second option
is Jim Carrey.

14:36.668 --> 14:37.734
Okay, that intrigues me.

14:37.734 --> 14:39.234
Can you give me
a little Jim Carrey?

14:39.234 --> 14:41.334
Oh, yes.

14:41.334 --> 14:43.168
-[laughs] Okay.
-Yeah.

14:43.168 --> 14:44.334
I see it.

14:44.334 --> 14:45.568
Can I hear Anna?

14:45.568 --> 14:47.834
Oh! Oh, my gosh.

14:47.834 --> 14:49.234
Oh!

14:49.234 --> 14:52.168
Oh, Brooke Lynn, oh.

14:52.168 --> 14:55.534
You are very good
at turning on a character.

14:55.534 --> 14:56.534
Thank you.

14:56.534 --> 14:58.168
I can't wait
to see you out there.

14:58.168 --> 14:59.201
Thanks, babes.

14:59.201 --> 15:01.068
Hi-ee!

15:01.068 --> 15:02.068
Hi, Kendall.

15:02.068 --> 15:03.768
Hello, bonjour, hi.

15:03.768 --> 15:05.234
So who are we thinking?

15:05.234 --> 15:07.668
So my first choice
is Kris Jenner.

15:07.668 --> 15:09.101
Ooh! Okay.

15:09.101 --> 15:10.768
Yes, I think that
a lot of my drag

15:10.768 --> 15:12.368
is kind of, like, making fun
of the Kardashians.

15:12.368 --> 15:13.934
Obviously, Kendall Gender.

15:13.934 --> 15:17.001
But the reason why I do it is
because I do really love them,

15:17.001 --> 15:19.434
and I like their stupidity
and their campiness.

15:19.434 --> 15:21.268
So what is it like

15:21.268 --> 15:24.601
being in a competition
with your drag family?

15:24.601 --> 15:25.834
In my wildest dreams,

15:25.834 --> 15:28.501
I couldn't have imagined
a more perfect situation.

15:28.501 --> 15:29.734
Uh-huh.

15:29.734 --> 15:30.601
Who would not
wanna experience this

15:30.601 --> 15:31.668
with your literal best friends?

15:31.668 --> 15:33.834
Do you also feel
a sense of competition,

15:33.834 --> 15:35.901
like, "I have to send these bitches home,
and I'm going to?"

15:35.901 --> 15:36.901
I think that
that's just something

15:36.901 --> 15:38.901
that I struggle with in my life.

15:38.901 --> 15:43.434
I sometimes make the comfort
of others the priority.

15:43.434 --> 15:44.868
And in this situation,
I just have to remember--

15:44.868 --> 15:46.201
It's all about you.

15:46.201 --> 15:47.434
It's about me,
and that's okay.

15:47.434 --> 15:49.168
Well, give us that
big mama energy.

15:49.168 --> 15:51.401
-Yes, honey.
-I cannot wait.

15:51.401 --> 15:54.234
I got the right color milkers today,
I promise.

15:54.234 --> 15:55.701
Perfect.

15:55.701 --> 15:57.534
-Remember me?
-Hi, Synthia.

15:57.534 --> 15:59.168
I am so happy to still be here.

15:59.168 --> 16:01.734
Are you? I'm very happy
you're here, too.

16:01.734 --> 16:04.501
So let me guess
who you're gonna do.

16:04.501 --> 16:06.334
Oh, my God, Brooke Lynn,

16:06.334 --> 16:08.234
I'm, like,
literally dying right now

16:08.234 --> 16:11.168
to be Rachel Zoe
on the Snatch Game.

16:11.168 --> 16:12.168
Oh!

16:12.168 --> 16:13.701
Things might get
a little awkward,

16:13.701 --> 16:15.934
because Brad's here, you know?

16:15.934 --> 16:19.001
Picking Rachel
is a really fun choice,

16:19.001 --> 16:22.101
because we have Brad Goreski
on Season 2.

16:22.101 --> 16:25.268
I don't know if you know
or have watched the Zoe Report,

16:25.268 --> 16:29.934
but Brad was Rachel's assistant,
and they had a falling out.

16:29.934 --> 16:31.101
Thank you.

16:31.101 --> 16:33.734
Okay, okay, okay.

16:33.734 --> 16:35.201
Well, well, well, well, well.

16:35.201 --> 16:36.534
-Hi!
-Hi, Eve.

16:36.534 --> 16:38.334
-Hi.
-Who are you thinking?

16:38.334 --> 16:39.834
I'm kind of known
for doing Jennifer Coolidge.

16:39.834 --> 16:41.368
People have seen me do it.
That's one option.

16:41.368 --> 16:42.234
Okay.

16:42.234 --> 16:44.001
Okay, do you wanna see
the other one?

16:44.001 --> 16:47.168
-Yes.
-Okay, one second.

16:47.168 --> 16:48.601
Where did she go?

16:48.601 --> 16:51.068
And my other option
is Bernie Sanders.

16:51.068 --> 16:54.034
Holy shit. [laughs]

16:54.034 --> 16:56.034
-I love it.
-Thank you.

16:56.034 --> 16:58.201
Brooke Lynn
is living for Bernie.

16:58.201 --> 17:00.101
She is feeling the Bern,

17:00.101 --> 17:01.401
and I wanna take
a really big risk

17:01.401 --> 17:04.101
and do something that
nobody would expect me to do.

17:04.101 --> 17:06.268
I'm a huge, huge, huge fan
of Bernie Sanders.

17:06.268 --> 17:07.901
I've watched all
of his speeches,

17:07.901 --> 17:09.668
and I know, like,
everything about him.

17:09.668 --> 17:11.034
Do you have the mannerisms down?

17:11.034 --> 17:13.034
Yes. Eve studies, yes, yes.

17:13.034 --> 17:15.168
-I really like that. Okay.
-Thank you.

17:15.168 --> 17:17.168
This could be
an icon-ique Snatch Game.

17:17.168 --> 17:18.201
Yeah. Do I have your vote?

17:18.201 --> 17:19.734
[both laugh]

17:19.734 --> 17:20.834
You have my vote.

17:20.834 --> 17:22.501
We'll party the house down boots, mama.

17:22.501 --> 17:24.534
[laughs]
Thank you, Eve.

17:24.534 --> 17:27.034
I am ready to kill
this challenge.

17:27.034 --> 17:31.734
Okay, queens, I cannot wait
to see what you do.

17:31.734 --> 17:34.101
Just commit, be confident,

17:34.101 --> 17:35.934
and make me laugh my blank off.

17:35.934 --> 17:37.068
Come on!

17:37.068 --> 17:38.401
And tomorrow on the main stage,

17:38.401 --> 17:40.368
category is...

17:40.368 --> 17:43.201
Made In Canada,
brought to us by Made.

17:43.201 --> 17:45.534
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

17:45.534 --> 17:47.934
Made champions Canadian content,

17:47.934 --> 17:50.234
from film to TV to video games,

17:50.234 --> 17:54.034
encouraging audiences
to seek more from their stories.

17:54.034 --> 17:57.501
So before you all
launch into superstardom,

17:57.501 --> 17:59.568
we want each of you
to pay homage

17:59.568 --> 18:03.334
to a Canadian scene stealer
who came before you.

18:03.334 --> 18:07.768
And, ladies, you might wanna
make sure you look extra hot,

18:07.768 --> 18:09.101
because joining us tomorrow

18:09.101 --> 18:11.834
is our extra-special
guest judge,

18:11.834 --> 18:14.001
Hollywood heartthrob
Connor Jessup.

18:14.001 --> 18:15.934
[cheering]

18:15.934 --> 18:17.334
Come on, daddy.

18:17.334 --> 18:21.368
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

18:21.368 --> 18:23.068
[all laugh]

18:23.068 --> 18:25.934
-Bye!
-Bye!

18:27.034 --> 18:30.734
Snatch Game separates
the winners from the losers.

18:30.734 --> 18:34.668
Without Snatch Game, baby,
huh, there's no crown.

18:37.168 --> 18:39.001
This is nice.

18:40.101 --> 18:42.668
Hi, I'm Traci Melchor
and we're live on the red carpet

18:42.668 --> 18:45.068
with Shetalk
at the Snatch Game.

18:48.901 --> 18:52.334
The stars are in full force
as Hollywood has gone north.

18:52.334 --> 18:54.201
Hola, chica.

18:54.201 --> 18:56.568
Yoko, what would be your
favorite Beatles song?

18:56.568 --> 18:58.168
None of them.
I broke them up.

19:00.034 --> 19:01.668
Can I get an inhaler?

19:01.668 --> 19:04.234
Because, Traci,
you took my breath away.

19:04.234 --> 19:07.001
Come on, shake that ass!

19:07.001 --> 19:09.101
So let's tuck in
and get ready for these stars

19:09.101 --> 19:11.101
to snatch fire to the rave.

19:11.101 --> 19:12.001
-Whoo-hoo-hoo.
-Whoo-hoo-hoo.

19:12.001 --> 19:13.101
Goodbye.
Boop-bioop-bee-doo.

19:13.101 --> 19:15.401
Wha, wha, wha.
Wha-wha-wha-wha-wha.

19:15.401 --> 19:18.234
[theme song plays]

19:18.234 --> 19:21.868
Welcome to Canada's gayest
game show sensation,

19:21.868 --> 19:24.034
the Snatch Game!

19:24.034 --> 19:26.401
[applause]

19:26.401 --> 19:27.934
I am your host,
Brooke Lynn Hytes,

19:27.934 --> 19:30.934
and I am back, back, back again,
because...

19:30.934 --> 19:32.101
they won't let me leave.

19:32.101 --> 19:33.434
[laughs]

19:33.434 --> 19:36.601
But now it's time
to meet our contestants.

19:36.601 --> 19:39.068
He's cute to boot,
and in a suit.

19:39.068 --> 19:40.601
It's Brad Goreski!

19:40.601 --> 19:41.868
Hey!

19:41.868 --> 19:43.601
Brad, I am so excited
you're here.

19:43.601 --> 19:45.168
I couldn't miss it.

19:45.168 --> 19:47.768
I absolutely love a good snatch.

19:47.768 --> 19:49.101
Do you?

19:50.734 --> 19:56.201
OMG, it is social media sensation
Bomanizer.

19:56.201 --> 19:59.934
Hey, Bomanizer, if you could have
your own reality show,

19:59.934 --> 20:01.434
what would it be called?

20:01.434 --> 20:04.401
Canada's Next Top.

20:04.401 --> 20:05.901
Top what?

20:05.901 --> 20:07.234
That's it.

20:07.234 --> 20:09.201
I like it.

20:11.168 --> 20:14.101
And now let's give
a big Hollywood North hello

20:14.101 --> 20:16.401
to our panel of stars.

20:19.168 --> 20:21.168
It's experimental pop princess

20:21.168 --> 20:24.701
and the wife of Elon Musk, Grimes.

20:24.701 --> 20:26.701
Hi, ding-a-lings.
I love your work.

20:26.701 --> 20:28.168
[all laugh]

20:28.168 --> 20:29.934
How do you pronounce
your son's name?

20:29.934 --> 20:32.201
E=MC2.

20:32.201 --> 20:34.034
I named him
after my wifi password.

20:34.034 --> 20:36.101
[all laugh]

20:36.101 --> 20:39.568
Please welcome
comedy legend Leslie Jones!

20:39.568 --> 20:41.501
Hey, white RuPaul,
how you doing?

20:41.501 --> 20:45.034
[all laugh]

20:45.034 --> 20:48.734
So, Leslie, tell me,
what do you look for in a man?

20:48.734 --> 20:49.768
Nine inches.

20:49.768 --> 20:50.868
[laughs]

20:50.868 --> 20:51.868
I think she's looking at you.

20:51.868 --> 20:53.101
I think I'm her type.

20:53.101 --> 20:56.501
You my type.
[all laugh]

20:56.501 --> 21:00.668
She is one of the most beloved
LGBTQ icons of Spain.

21:00.668 --> 21:02.368
La Veneno.

21:02.368 --> 21:03.868
Hola, chica.

21:03.868 --> 21:07.168
[speaking Spanish]

21:07.168 --> 21:09.734
La Veneno, tell me, how are you enjoying
the Canadian weather?

21:09.734 --> 21:12.268
My English is not very good.

21:12.268 --> 21:13.434
Mm-hmm.

21:13.434 --> 21:15.501
And neither is this accent.

21:15.501 --> 21:17.901
[all laugh]

21:17.901 --> 21:20.068
And all the way from Calabasas,

21:20.068 --> 21:21.834
Kris Jenner's
in the house, y'all.

21:21.834 --> 21:25.768
Oh, hey, Ellen, it's so good
to be back here with you.

21:25.768 --> 21:27.668
You are doing amazing, sweetie.

21:27.668 --> 21:31.001
Up next, it's Yoko Ono.

21:31.001 --> 21:33.501
Performance art is everywhere.

21:33.501 --> 21:35.534
Performance art is you.

21:35.534 --> 21:37.401
Okay.

21:39.701 --> 21:42.201
All right, then,
it's Jim Carrey.

21:42.201 --> 21:45.068
Hey, how's it going?
[laughs]

21:45.068 --> 21:46.434
You know what? I can't seem to remember
the name of this game.

21:46.434 --> 21:48.701
Is it So You Think
You Can Snatch?

21:48.701 --> 21:50.668
Oh, wait,
it's the Snatch Game.

21:50.668 --> 21:52.701
[laughs]

21:52.701 --> 21:54.001
He is our favorite socialist.

21:54.001 --> 21:57.234
It is U.S. Senator
Bernie Sanders.

21:57.234 --> 21:59.201
I've been double-vaccinated.

21:59.201 --> 22:01.568
So tell me,
when you run again, Senator,

22:01.568 --> 22:03.434
who are you gonna choose
as your running mate?

22:03.434 --> 22:06.068
I think I really need
to capture the gay community.

22:06.068 --> 22:10.268
And I think RuPaul would be
a great running mate.

22:10.268 --> 22:11.568
I might donate.

22:11.568 --> 22:15.001
She's loquacious
and oh, so curvaceous.

22:15.001 --> 22:18.201
It's my Colombiana,
Sofa Vergara.

22:18.201 --> 22:21.168
It's a pleasure to be here.
You never invite me.

22:21.168 --> 22:22.368
It's like you don't love me.

22:22.368 --> 22:24.201
[all laugh]

22:24.201 --> 22:25.434
Do you?

22:25.434 --> 22:27.568
I love you, Sofa.
That's not true.

22:27.568 --> 22:28.734
Love this country so much,

22:28.734 --> 22:30.834
it's so cold,
I don't need a bra.

22:30.834 --> 22:33.001
[all laugh]

22:33.001 --> 22:38.168
Up next, it's a stylist
to the stars, Rachel Zoe.

22:38.168 --> 22:39.334
Hi, babe-babe.

22:39.334 --> 22:42.034
Rachel, I have to ask you,
do you recognize anybody here?

22:42.034 --> 22:46.234
Yes, let's address the pink fashion
elephant in the room.

22:46.234 --> 22:49.001
Brad, I respect you,

22:49.001 --> 22:51.434
and I would do anything
for the gays.

22:51.434 --> 22:54.068
[laughs]

22:54.068 --> 22:55.601
It's nice to see you again, Rachel.

22:55.601 --> 22:56.601
It's been a while.

22:56.601 --> 22:57.734
It has.

22:57.734 --> 23:00.268
I'm a few clients less,
but that's all good.

23:00.268 --> 23:02.401
[all laugh]

23:04.201 --> 23:07.201
All right, so y'all ready
to snatch up with the stars?

23:07.201 --> 23:11.001
Let's get this energy started.
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

23:11.001 --> 23:13.234
-I want what he's having.
-Yeah, no kidding.

23:13.234 --> 23:15.034
All right, first question.

23:15.034 --> 23:17.668
The weather in Canada
can be such a drag.

23:17.668 --> 23:21.001
You get 10 months of winter
and two months of blank.

23:23.401 --> 23:25.601
[sniffs]

23:25.601 --> 23:26.501
Bomanizer?

23:26.501 --> 23:29.501
You get two months
of disrespect.

23:29.501 --> 23:31.534
-Oh!
-Oh!

23:31.534 --> 23:33.168
Let's see if we have a match.

23:33.168 --> 23:35.201
Sofa, what did you put down?

23:35.201 --> 23:37.201
Well, because
I'm very hot right now,

23:37.201 --> 23:41.401
just looking at this papacita,
I said, "moist."

23:41.401 --> 23:43.234
Two months of moist.

23:45.368 --> 23:48.068
Oh, Sofa, I think
we have a nip slip.

23:48.068 --> 23:50.601
[gasps] Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

23:50.601 --> 23:52.901
Can we get some fashion tape, people?

23:52.901 --> 23:56.034
This is a fashion emergency.
[all laugh]

23:56.034 --> 23:57.568
Oh. Ooh! Sorry!

23:57.568 --> 24:00.268
I'm not kidding, guys.
Fashion tape.

24:00.268 --> 24:02.701
[all laugh]

24:02.701 --> 24:03.568
Kris Jenner.

24:03.568 --> 24:06.068
Two months
of bladder leakage, doll.

24:06.068 --> 24:08.501
My vagina is the size
of a football field.

24:11.034 --> 24:12.201
Grimes?

24:12.201 --> 24:13.501
Okay, so as you know,

24:13.501 --> 24:15.368
I gave birth
to an external disk drive.

24:15.368 --> 24:17.734
I am raising him with, like,
a nonbinary computer code

24:17.734 --> 24:19.168
so that he could choose to be

24:19.168 --> 24:22.668
either a desktop or a laptop
when he grows up.

24:22.668 --> 24:24.234
So I said, "nuts and bolts."

24:24.234 --> 24:25.501
That's all he poops.

24:25.501 --> 24:27.868
[all laugh]

24:27.868 --> 24:29.201
Clink, clink, clink,
clink, clink.

24:29.201 --> 24:30.501
La Veneno.

24:30.501 --> 24:33.068
[speaking Spanish]

24:33.068 --> 24:35.034
What did you write down?

24:35.034 --> 24:38.534
[speaking Spanish]...
la pusseta!

24:38.534 --> 24:40.701
Two months of...
la pusseta.

24:40.701 --> 24:44.034
Ai! La pusseta!

24:44.034 --> 24:45.701
Ai, you don't even know
what it means?

24:45.701 --> 24:47.734
¡Escndalo!

24:47.734 --> 24:50.268
-[laughs]
-What is happening?

24:50.268 --> 24:52.034
Subtitles, please.

24:53.401 --> 24:55.701
All right, well, there were
no matches, unfortunately.

24:55.701 --> 24:57.101
Oh, shoot.

24:57.101 --> 24:58.168
[laughs]

24:58.168 --> 25:00.234
Next question. Hey, Brad?

25:00.234 --> 25:02.901
Did you hear about the new technology
for drag queens?

25:02.901 --> 25:06.001
It's an app that helps
drag queens find their blank.

25:06.001 --> 25:07.901
Oh!

25:10.068 --> 25:14.868
It's an app that helps
a drag queen find her tuck.

25:14.868 --> 25:17.934
Oh, mine goes missing
all the time.

25:17.934 --> 25:21.834
Jim, did you hear about
the new technology for--

25:21.834 --> 25:25.201
No.
[all laugh]

25:25.201 --> 25:26.234
Come on, come on,
give it to me.

25:26.234 --> 25:29.001
It's an app that helps
drag queens find their blank.

25:29.001 --> 25:31.001
Oh, my gosh, let's find--

25:31.001 --> 25:33.034
Oh, my God, some energy!

25:33.034 --> 25:36.201
Aah! I'm just fucking
shakin' up here!

25:36.201 --> 25:39.034
Oh, my God.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

25:39.034 --> 25:40.168
Oh, my God.

25:40.168 --> 25:42.034
-You're looking sexy over here.
-Whoa.

25:42.034 --> 25:45.068
Yo, honey,
it's me, Jim Carrey.

25:45.068 --> 25:47.568
[laughs]

25:47.568 --> 25:48.734
[all laugh]

25:48.734 --> 25:50.068
Do you feel better?

25:50.068 --> 25:51.901
Absolutely.

25:51.901 --> 25:53.534
[laughs]

25:53.534 --> 25:54.501
Bernie Sanders.

25:54.501 --> 25:55.734
I think this is an app

25:55.734 --> 25:58.034
to help drag queens
find their healthcare.

25:59.434 --> 26:02.901
97% of drag queens
are uninsured or underinsured.

26:02.901 --> 26:04.568
#Facts.

26:04.568 --> 26:05.701
Rachel.

26:05.701 --> 26:07.201
Wait, what?

26:07.201 --> 26:09.701
Sorry, Brooke,
I'm a bit distracted.

26:09.701 --> 26:12.868
I'm confirming award season gowns
with Cameron Diaz.

26:12.868 --> 26:16.034
So, yeah, things are
a little bananas right now.

26:16.034 --> 26:18.768
[all laugh]

26:18.768 --> 26:22.168
Synthia is always on character,

26:22.168 --> 26:24.601
and she's bouncing
back and forth so easily.

26:24.601 --> 26:27.368
Like, that is Rachel Zoe
standing right there.

26:27.368 --> 26:28.768
It's terrifying.

26:28.768 --> 26:31.168
Can't talk right now.
Playing the Snatch Game.

26:31.168 --> 26:33.001
Okay, bye, babe.

26:33.001 --> 26:36.434
All right, Yoko.

26:36.434 --> 26:38.534
It's to find
the Mother Superior.

26:38.534 --> 26:42.101
Yoko is performance artist.

26:42.101 --> 26:45.534
The performance is
you put around the body.

26:45.534 --> 26:49.168
You can call it art
or performance.

26:49.168 --> 26:50.668
Well, thank you, Yoko.

26:50.668 --> 26:53.868
Comedy is subjective?

26:53.868 --> 26:55.534
Maybe.

26:57.734 --> 27:01.568
Sofa, it's an app that helps
drag queens find their blank.

27:01.568 --> 27:03.668
Boobs.

27:03.668 --> 27:07.201
Boobs. Because people
love boobs, and I love boobs,

27:07.201 --> 27:08.934
even if I got botched a little.

27:08.934 --> 27:10.034
Yeah.

27:10.034 --> 27:13.368
The judges
have stopped laughing,

27:13.368 --> 27:16.501
and I am trapped
in this character.

27:16.501 --> 27:18.368
People know me for these.

27:18.368 --> 27:20.001
Not a match, unfortunately.

27:22.234 --> 27:23.401
Fuck.

27:23.401 --> 27:28.001
Next question. You won't believe
what Bomanizer went viral for

27:28.001 --> 27:29.668
on TikTok this time.

27:29.668 --> 27:33.901
His account blew up after
he taught his dog how to blank.

27:35.068 --> 27:36.034
Bomanizer?

27:36.034 --> 27:38.234
Reclaim the word "bitch."

27:38.234 --> 27:39.401
How empowering!

27:39.401 --> 27:42.101
Let's see if we can find a bitch--
I mean, a match.

27:42.101 --> 27:44.168
Leslie Jones,
what did you write?

27:44.168 --> 27:47.068
"Sit up and beg"
like my titties.

27:47.068 --> 27:49.101
[laughs] Like your titties?

27:49.101 --> 27:50.601
Like my titties.

27:50.601 --> 27:51.701
How do they do that, exactly?

27:55.168 --> 27:57.701
-They beggin'.
-[laughs]

27:57.701 --> 27:59.001
They beggin'! Yeah!

28:00.268 --> 28:03.834
Yoko Ono, Bomanizer's
socials blew up

28:03.834 --> 28:06.201
after he taught his dog
how to blank.

28:06.201 --> 28:08.201
You went viral, too?

28:08.201 --> 28:12.668
Because me, in my time,
I went viral to pose nude.

28:12.668 --> 28:14.601
I was a bit younger,

28:14.601 --> 28:18.201
so down there, it look
a little bit more like this.

28:18.201 --> 28:20.834
And you can
see through the lips,

28:20.834 --> 28:22.701
and this is why I went viral.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.068
Did you pose nude?

28:24.068 --> 28:26.868
Well, no?

28:26.868 --> 28:29.768
Yoko. Girl,
she broke up the Beatles,

28:29.768 --> 28:31.534
and now she's breaking up
Snatch Game.

28:33.168 --> 28:34.201
Up next, Bernie Sanders,
what did you put?

28:34.201 --> 28:35.234
Oh. All right, all right,

28:35.234 --> 28:39.268
I think that Boman taught
his dog how to win an election.

28:39.268 --> 28:41.601
And I have to say
I am open to lessons.

28:41.601 --> 28:42.568
Oh!

28:42.568 --> 28:44.234
And I would love to put you
in that position,

28:44.234 --> 28:45.101
among many others.

28:48.068 --> 28:50.101
Rachel Zoe,
what did you put down?

28:50.101 --> 28:53.401
Okay, you guys, I don't really
understand this one,

28:53.401 --> 28:56.901
but my gay intern,
who I call Brad number two,

28:56.901 --> 28:59.168
told me to say it.

28:59.168 --> 29:03.568
She done already
done had herses.

29:03.568 --> 29:05.334
Brad, do you care
to respond to that?

29:05.334 --> 29:08.101
I only care to respond to you
that I wasn't an intern.

29:08.101 --> 29:10.168
Oh.

29:10.168 --> 29:11.901
I was an assistant.

29:11.901 --> 29:14.168
-I died.

29:34.168 --> 29:36.501
I just went
to an alternate reality.

29:36.501 --> 29:37.768
Talk to Grimes.

29:37.768 --> 29:40.768

29:40.768 --> 29:43.901

Grimes--hee hee hee--logged in.

29:43.901 --> 29:44.834
Hello.

29:44.834 --> 29:46.201
-Hi!
-I'm back.

29:46.201 --> 29:47.601
Where did you go?

29:47.601 --> 29:49.001
Just charging my third vagina.

29:49.001 --> 29:50.668
-Your third vagina?
-Yes.

29:50.668 --> 29:52.734
[all laugh]

29:52.734 --> 29:54.334
What did you write down?

29:54.334 --> 29:57.268
Oh, my goodness, I wrote down
"speaking Latin,"

29:57.268 --> 29:59.834
and honestly, I would love
to collaborate with her

29:59.834 --> 30:00.901
on my next album.

30:00.901 --> 30:02.168
What is your album called?

30:02.168 --> 30:03.934
Honey, This Is
The Apocalypse, Baby.

All right, well, that is all
the time we have for today.

30:13.701 --> 30:15.268
And the winner
of the Snatch Game is...

30:17.334 --> 30:19.068
Me!

30:19.068 --> 30:21.101
Isn't that a first?

30:21.101 --> 30:22.168
[all laugh]

30:22.168 --> 30:23.368
Congratulations.

30:24.934 --> 30:28.068
Bomanizer and Brad,
thanks so much for playing.

30:28.068 --> 30:30.434
And we will see you next time
on the Snatch Game.

30:30.434 --> 30:32.568
Don't do it.
She'll look terrible.

30:48.434 --> 30:50.168
How are you feeling?

30:50.168 --> 30:51.101
I'm disappointed right now.

30:51.101 --> 30:52.934
I feel like it was
a safe performance.

30:52.934 --> 30:54.201
I feel like
it was middle of the road.

30:54.201 --> 30:55.668
I was so excited to play Bernie.

30:55.668 --> 30:57.034
Yeah.

30:57.034 --> 30:59.101
Snatch Game
was really challenging.

30:59.101 --> 31:01.834
For some reason, I just thought
I was gonna really pull it off.

31:01.834 --> 31:03.334
Don't get in your head, sis.

31:03.334 --> 31:06.034
I'm disappointed because
I kind of set myself up

31:06.034 --> 31:07.101
for disappointment
with that, you know?

31:07.101 --> 31:09.001
You think that's the thing?

31:09.001 --> 31:09.868
I mean, I don't know,

31:09.868 --> 31:11.234
but I can't control it,
so I don't fucking know.

31:11.234 --> 31:13.168
Absolutely
you can control it, baby.

31:13.168 --> 31:14.734
See, this is--
but that's what I don't need.

31:14.734 --> 31:16.034
Like, I don't need a pep talk.

31:16.034 --> 31:17.534
No, it's not a pep talk.

31:17.534 --> 31:19.001
I just wanna make sure
you're okay.

31:19.001 --> 31:20.368
I'm just saying
I'm disappointed right now.

31:20.368 --> 31:22.568
I think it's okay
for me to be disappointed.

31:22.568 --> 31:25.834
I think what some of these girls
need to understand about me

31:25.834 --> 31:27.001
is that I'm just a complainer,

31:27.001 --> 31:28.868
and I don't need
a therapy session

31:28.868 --> 31:31.034
every single time I'm a little irritated
about something.

31:31.034 --> 31:32.934
I'm not gonna tell you guys
how to react or respond,

31:32.934 --> 31:35.168
except for right now
I just wanna be done with it

31:35.168 --> 31:36.668
and move on
to the next conversation.

31:36.668 --> 31:39.334
Well, I'm trimming my eyebrows,
just to let everyone to know.

31:39.334 --> 31:41.068
[all laugh]

31:41.068 --> 31:45.934
Am I feeling cute today,
or I'm feeling more boot?

31:45.934 --> 31:47.668
-More what?
-Boot.

31:47.668 --> 31:49.068
You shady bitch.

31:49.068 --> 31:51.368
Suki has a very good
sense of humor.

31:51.368 --> 31:52.368
It comes from the fact

31:52.368 --> 31:55.868
that I was never seeing myself
represented in the TVs

31:55.868 --> 31:58.168
or, like, as a queer drag queen.

31:58.168 --> 31:59.734
That really pushed
my personality

31:59.734 --> 32:03.868
and pushed my drag persona
to be this headstrong woman.

32:03.868 --> 32:06.034
To find my place
in the community,

32:06.034 --> 32:07.701
I had to stumble,
I had to fumble,

32:07.701 --> 32:09.601
I had to be living on the edge.

32:09.601 --> 32:12.001
There's no true opening

32:12.001 --> 32:13.701
for, like,
an Asian drag queen like me.

32:13.701 --> 32:15.234
You have to be typecasted,

32:15.234 --> 32:18.068
so it's always, okay,
can you do Lucy Liu?

32:18.068 --> 32:19.234
Can you do Asian character?

32:19.234 --> 32:20.734
So that's why you're booked.

32:20.734 --> 32:22.168
-The filler, yeah.
-Filling that spot.

32:22.168 --> 32:24.334
The filler queen
in the cast. Yeah.

32:24.334 --> 32:25.734
And that goes, I think,
for all of us,

32:25.734 --> 32:28.068
with all of our
different nationalities.

32:28.068 --> 32:30.368
I know for the Caribbean,
South American community,

32:30.368 --> 32:33.101
while there is so much progression
in certain parts,

32:33.101 --> 32:34.434
there's complete oppression
in others.

32:34.434 --> 32:38.101
Like, you can't wear makeup,
you can't be feminine.

32:38.101 --> 32:40.201
So, you know,
being from these countries

32:40.201 --> 32:42.201
and being able to represent
is just so important.

32:42.201 --> 32:43.934
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

32:43.934 --> 32:47.034
As a child, if I knew
that a lifestyle like this

32:47.034 --> 32:48.601
was possible for people like me,

32:48.601 --> 32:51.068
it would have made things
so much easier.

32:51.068 --> 32:53.168
So I came out to my parents.

32:53.168 --> 32:54.001
They were like,
"Did someone rape you?

32:54.001 --> 32:55.934
Do you want to be a woman?"

32:55.934 --> 32:57.268
They're, like, nobody
in my family is like you.

32:57.268 --> 32:59.734
Why do you
wanna do this right now?

32:59.734 --> 33:01.434
Back home in Greece,
gay people don't exist.

33:01.434 --> 33:03.168
It's like
we're not part of society,

33:03.168 --> 33:05.168
we're not part of culture,
we're not part of anything.

33:05.168 --> 33:06.701
I have learned to accept

33:06.701 --> 33:08.068
that they do not grow up
with people like me,

33:08.068 --> 33:10.001
so my parents haven't seen
a person like me on TV.

33:10.001 --> 33:11.234
But, like, I'm very happy

33:11.234 --> 33:14.501
that I at least can be
this Greek queer icon right now.

33:14.501 --> 33:16.368
And I get to show them,
look, I have a family.

33:16.368 --> 33:18.268
I have friends
that love me for who I am.

33:18.268 --> 33:21.068
You know, I'm--like...
[sobs]

33:21.068 --> 33:22.101
Like, I never thought

33:22.101 --> 33:25.001
that I was ever going
to be able to live this life,

33:25.001 --> 33:27.668
and I'm just so thankful.

33:27.668 --> 33:29.334
I'm sorry.

33:29.334 --> 33:31.201
I just want the world to see

33:31.201 --> 33:33.668
that there is more
for people like me

33:33.668 --> 33:35.234
than disease and loneliness.

33:35.234 --> 33:37.268
That's not what we are.

33:37.268 --> 33:39.168
We are successful artists.

33:39.168 --> 33:42.201
We are teachers, doctors, friends, lovers,

33:42.201 --> 33:44.668
and I want my country
and people like me

33:44.668 --> 33:47.068
to see someone like me
do so well

33:47.068 --> 33:48.501
and exist
and be happy and proud.

33:48.501 --> 33:50.168

her love life, her everything.

36:20.334 --> 36:22.034
It's just so relatable,

36:22.034 --> 36:25.234
because being misunderstood
is what I was for years.

36:25.234 --> 36:29.168
History is on the runway,
so you can eat it all up.

36:29.168 --> 36:32.168
Traci: Sandra Oh, no,
she better don't.

36:32.168 --> 36:34.001
Brooke Lynn: Adriana.

36:34.001 --> 36:37.868
Adriana: Vanessa Morgan is the
lesbian queen of the serpents.

36:37.868 --> 36:39.834
Oh, my anaconda do.

36:39.834 --> 36:41.501
[all laugh]

36:41.501 --> 36:45.168
She is this
Afro-Latina badass woman,

36:45.168 --> 36:48.601
and embodies
female empowerment.

36:48.601 --> 36:50.534
Rhinestones, leather, latex.

36:50.534 --> 36:53.434
I look sexy.

36:53.434 --> 36:55.668
Connor:
I'd let her slither in.

36:55.668 --> 36:58.268
Brooke Lynn:
Like my hair, it's Gia Metric.

36:58.268 --> 37:02.601
Who is that sexy bitch?

37:02.601 --> 37:05.168
Gia: She is Mike Myers.

37:05.168 --> 37:11.168
As a kid, he inspired me
to be kooky and outrageous.

37:11.168 --> 37:13.434
Traci: I'd love to see
her gold member.

37:13.434 --> 37:14.368
[all laugh]

37:14.368 --> 37:16.768
She is wearing blue velvet,

37:16.768 --> 37:19.001
she has sexual ruffles,

37:19.001 --> 37:21.568
and you better take it all in.

37:21.568 --> 37:24.534
Brad: Throw me a frikkin'
boner here, people.

37:24.534 --> 37:27.034
Get in my bussy!
[laughs]

37:27.034 --> 37:28.434
What accent is that?

37:28.434 --> 37:31.368
I was supposed to do
a Scottish accent.

37:31.368 --> 37:34.034
Brooke Lynn:
Now Kendall Gender.

37:34.034 --> 37:35.368
Yes!

37:35.368 --> 37:39.368
Kendall: I am Canadian icon
Stacey McKenzie.

37:39.368 --> 37:41.668
Stacey is a beautiful representation

37:41.668 --> 37:43.668
for the lighter-skinned
Black community.

37:43.668 --> 37:46.068
You can tell
she's very well red.

37:46.068 --> 37:49.201
This wig is laid, bitch.

37:49.201 --> 37:52.101
I have braids
cascading down my back.

37:52.101 --> 37:55.701
I am here to show those judges
these golden shoulders, bitch.

37:55.701 --> 37:57.501
I miss you, Stacey.

37:59.101 --> 38:01.734
Next, Eve 6000.

38:01.734 --> 38:04.201
Eve: My inspiration
is Carrie-Anne Moss.

38:04.201 --> 38:05.401
She was in the Matrix movies.

38:05.401 --> 38:08.201
They were directed
by two trans sisters,

38:08.201 --> 38:09.934
and I think
it's really important

38:09.934 --> 38:11.768
to represent my community
in that way.

38:11.768 --> 38:14.768
I am cinched within an inch
of my fucking life,

38:14.768 --> 38:16.034
I'm padded for the gods,

38:16.034 --> 38:18.534
and I am walking puddles
on the runway.

38:18.534 --> 38:20.168
And I look gorgeous for once,

38:20.168 --> 38:22.768
because all the other looks have been
so campy and stupid.

38:22.768 --> 38:25.501
Is she gonna take the red pill
or the blue pill?

38:25.501 --> 38:26.734
Brooke Lynn:
If she takes the blue pill,

38:26.734 --> 38:28.168
she'll last all night.

38:28.168 --> 38:30.701
Next, Icesis Couture.

38:30.701 --> 38:32.701
Brad: Well, this look is mint.

38:32.701 --> 38:36.268
Icesis: My runway look
is an homage to Sandra Oh,

38:36.268 --> 38:37.734
my hometown girl,

38:37.734 --> 38:40.868
with her iconic role
as Grey's Anatomy.

38:40.868 --> 38:43.034
Paging Dr. McCreamy.

38:43.034 --> 38:46.234
I am a nurse, doctor, fashion.

38:46.234 --> 38:48.901
This is a love letter
to all the medical workers.

38:48.901 --> 38:50.934
Just to put a smile
on their face

38:50.934 --> 38:52.868
after the shit that they've
went through for the past year.

38:52.868 --> 38:56.201
Traci: Oh, she gets the D.
The M.D.

38:56.201 --> 38:58.234
Brooke Lynn:
And finally, Pythia.

38:58.234 --> 39:00.501
Aah!
[all laugh]

39:00.501 --> 39:02.101
Pythia:
I am drawing inspiration

39:02.101 --> 39:03.668
from Catherine O'Hara.

39:03.668 --> 39:06.068
Growing up, I didn't necessarily
have any icons

39:06.068 --> 39:09.501
that I could look up to
that were exactly me.

39:09.501 --> 39:13.034
So I was always attracted to these
weird, eccentric women.

39:13.034 --> 39:15.101
Okay, I heard she had
a "claws" in her contract,

39:15.101 --> 39:16.001
but this is ridiculous.

39:16.001 --> 39:20.501
Women like her are the driving force
of why I do drag.

39:20.501 --> 39:23.434
Brooke Lynn: Wow, she really
Moira Rose to the occasion.

39:23.434 --> 39:25.601
[all laugh]

39:25.601 --> 39:28.068
Caw-caw-caw-caw-caw-caw-caw!

39:28.068 --> 39:30.101
Welcome, queens.

39:31.368 --> 39:34.401
Based on your performance
in the Snatch Game

39:34.401 --> 39:36.234
and your runway presentations,

39:36.234 --> 39:37.701
we have made some decisions.

39:39.434 --> 39:43.001
When I call your name,
please step forward.

39:43.001 --> 39:46.168
Kimora Amour.

39:46.168 --> 39:49.168
Synthia Kiss.

39:49.168 --> 39:51.401
Adriana.

39:53.201 --> 39:54.034
Suki Doll.

39:55.568 --> 39:58.101
Eve 6000.

39:59.768 --> 40:01.568
Pythia.

40:04.368 --> 40:07.234
You represent the tops
and the bottoms of the week.

40:07.234 --> 40:10.501
The rest of you are safe.

40:10.501 --> 40:11.768
You may go untuck
in the werkroom.

40:14.868 --> 40:17.101
First up, Kimora Amour.

40:17.101 --> 40:20.034
Your performance of Leslie Jones

40:20.034 --> 40:23.334
had me on the Kimora Afloor, honey.

40:23.334 --> 40:26.934
It was so fun,
you kept the character up.

40:26.934 --> 40:30.268
The Leslie Jones
was a little one-note,

40:30.268 --> 40:33.701
but it was an amazing note,
and you committed to it totally.

40:33.701 --> 40:35.101
I will agree with Connor.

40:35.101 --> 40:37.101
It was a little one-note for me,

40:37.101 --> 40:40.101
but Leslie Jones
is kind of that person.

40:40.101 --> 40:43.101
You as Deborah Cox
as Josephine Baker,

40:43.101 --> 40:44.501
it's a show-stopper.

40:44.501 --> 40:47.868
I feel like we are seeing you
in your true form tonight,

40:47.868 --> 40:48.934
the pageant queen.

40:48.934 --> 40:51.034
It's very presentation
at the pageant.

40:51.034 --> 40:54.601
And let's talk about the way
you handled the runway.

40:54.601 --> 40:57.401
You had such a command,
you took your time.

40:57.401 --> 41:00.201
And I love that
you made us want you.

41:00.201 --> 41:02.668
Deborah Cox has always been
an inspiration to me.

41:02.668 --> 41:05.168
I had to pay homage to her.

41:05.168 --> 41:07.868
I feather-and-stoned this myself
and fringed it.

41:07.868 --> 41:11.068
Honestly, this was my heart
and soul in this one.

41:11.068 --> 41:12.101
I think she'd be proud.

41:12.101 --> 41:13.701
I hope so.

41:13.701 --> 41:17.034
Next up, Synthia Kiss.

41:17.034 --> 41:18.668
Well, Synthia...

41:18.668 --> 41:20.934
Hmm.
[both laugh]

41:20.934 --> 41:23.501
Portraying Rachel Zoe,

41:23.501 --> 41:25.901
somebody that I know
very, very well, you know,

41:25.901 --> 41:27.568
it was like I was there again.

41:27.568 --> 41:29.568
Triggered.
[both laugh]

41:29.568 --> 41:32.768
Triggered and delighted
at the same time.

41:32.768 --> 41:34.068
Oh, my goodness.

41:34.068 --> 41:36.001
You did such a good job.

41:36.001 --> 41:37.101
Yes!

41:37.101 --> 41:40.101
It was bananas.
It was major.

41:40.101 --> 41:41.701
[laughs]

41:41.701 --> 41:45.168
You've now made Rachel Zoe
my favorite celebrity stylist.

41:47.368 --> 41:50.034
[laughs] Snap!

41:50.034 --> 41:52.168
-Oh, no.
-[laughs]

41:52.168 --> 41:54.401
[imitating Rachel Zoe]
What have I done?

41:54.401 --> 41:58.001
Then this look,
Jeanne Beker, Canadian icon,

41:58.001 --> 42:00.534
this is just her
to an absolute T.

42:00.534 --> 42:01.668
Thank you, love.

42:01.668 --> 42:04.201
I grew up watching Jeanne Beker,

42:04.201 --> 42:07.534
and you did not give us
an impersonation,

42:07.534 --> 42:10.434
you gave us
the essence of Jeanne.

42:10.434 --> 42:12.068
This must feel really great,

42:12.068 --> 42:14.201
having almost gone home
last week.

42:14.201 --> 42:15.501
Yes, it does.

42:15.501 --> 42:17.001
Yes, yes, it does.

42:17.001 --> 42:20.601
Up next, we have Adriana.

42:20.601 --> 42:23.368
When I heard that you were
going to be Vanessa Morgan,

42:23.368 --> 42:26.101
I was like,
oh, what is this gonna be?

42:26.101 --> 42:27.001
And I think

42:27.001 --> 42:29.201
that this is a really great
interpretation of that,

42:29.201 --> 42:31.068
and it has a nice polish to it.

42:31.068 --> 42:33.034
The snakes, the crystals,
the purple,

42:33.034 --> 42:34.168
it's all working for me.

42:34.168 --> 42:37.868
It's what I imagine I look like
when I used to go to the club.

42:37.868 --> 42:39.034
That's it, right?

42:39.034 --> 42:40.334
Whoo-whoo.

42:40.334 --> 42:41.534
[all laugh]

42:41.534 --> 42:43.601
You as Sofa Vergara,

42:43.601 --> 42:46.601
I thought you had the dress
and the boobs.

42:46.601 --> 42:51.168
I feel like Sofa Vergara
is more sexy than sexual.

42:51.168 --> 42:52.368
Yeah.

42:52.368 --> 42:55.601
Sofa has kind of like
an effervescence,

42:55.601 --> 42:58.501
and there was no pull for me.

42:58.501 --> 43:00.401
I know how it feels.
It's not a fun feeling.

43:00.401 --> 43:03.001
-I'm very disappointed.
-Mm-hmm.

43:03.001 --> 43:05.434
Because I just feel
that Sofa is such an icon.

43:05.434 --> 43:07.001
Send her flowers after this.

43:07.001 --> 43:08.768
[all laugh]

43:08.768 --> 43:12.001
Suki Doll, how are you?

43:12.001 --> 43:14.068
I'm doing very fine.

43:14.068 --> 43:16.034
[all laugh]

43:16.034 --> 43:20.168
Tell me about your choice
of Yoko Ono for Snatch Game.

43:20.168 --> 43:22.901
My approach to drag
and many things in life

43:22.901 --> 43:24.068
is to challenge yourself,

43:24.068 --> 43:25.768
and paying homage
to my Asian culture,

43:25.768 --> 43:27.434
also somebody
who is a performer also.

43:27.434 --> 43:33.034
But I didn't blend well my humor
with Yoko's personality.

43:33.034 --> 43:36.434
You picked a tough character,
and it didn't work.

43:36.434 --> 43:38.101
I was trying to see
if you had flashbacks

43:38.101 --> 43:40.601
-or PTSD at the same time.
-Oh, my God.

43:40.601 --> 43:43.001
I was, like,
where's the laughing button.

43:43.001 --> 43:46.501
But this look, girl,
literally all of my clients

43:46.501 --> 43:49.201
are gonna be like,
"Where do I get Suki Doll's trench?"

43:49.201 --> 43:50.068
Mm-hmm.

43:50.068 --> 43:52.934
That trench
is a number one bestseller.

43:52.934 --> 43:54.334
I think Sandra Oh

43:54.334 --> 43:56.401
is gonna be phoning you
for that trench coat.

43:56.401 --> 43:59.034
The color pink makes me wild,

43:59.034 --> 44:02.001
and I like things
either big or mini.

44:02.001 --> 44:04.668
Like a big button
or a mini burger.

44:04.668 --> 44:06.668
I'm a size queen.
What can I say?

44:06.668 --> 44:10.368
-Aren't we all?
-There ya go.

44:10.368 --> 44:11.668
-Eve.
-Hi.

44:11.668 --> 44:14.001
I felt like you really
embodied Bernie Sanders.

44:14.001 --> 44:17.334
But then everything around it,
it didn't hit,

44:17.334 --> 44:18.568
and I really wanted it to.

44:18.568 --> 44:21.201
I was really excited
when I heard the voice.

44:21.201 --> 44:23.034
I was like, oh, my God.

44:23.034 --> 44:24.401
You sounded like him,
you looked like him,

44:24.401 --> 44:28.001
but it felt like
a dialed-back version of it.

44:28.868 --> 44:31.068
Your look, however, I love this.

44:31.068 --> 44:33.501
I would wear this.
It's beautiful.

44:33.501 --> 44:35.734
As Carrie-Anne Moss,
I could feel

44:35.734 --> 44:40.068
that you tried to dial up your runway
performance a little bit,

44:40.068 --> 44:43.001
and I appreciate the effort
to take our critique

44:43.001 --> 44:46.868
and put it into
what we are seeing.

44:46.868 --> 44:48.234
The glasses are amazing.

44:48.234 --> 44:50.534
The green in the gown
is beautiful.

44:50.534 --> 44:52.168
When I think of Carrie-Anne Moss
in the Matrix,

44:52.168 --> 44:55.668
I think of the really slicked-back,
shiny hair,

44:55.668 --> 44:59.901
and this hair feels a little basic
and flat from here.

44:59.901 --> 45:02.034
What? Okay.

45:02.034 --> 45:03.501
All right.

45:03.501 --> 45:06.001
It's not flat, but...
[laughs]

45:06.001 --> 45:07.168
but thank you.

45:08.434 --> 45:10.001
All right, Pythia.

45:10.001 --> 45:11.068
Caw, caw.

45:11.068 --> 45:17.001
You as Grimes, you were quirky
and out of this world.

45:17.001 --> 45:19.768
You did such a good job,
and you made me laugh.

45:19.768 --> 45:21.534
I loved it when you logged off.

45:21.534 --> 45:22.868
That was such a great moment
for me.

45:22.868 --> 45:25.034
You made all of
the little things funny.

45:25.034 --> 45:27.101
Like, I was just, like,
what is she gonna do now?

45:27.101 --> 45:29.601
It's so--where are we?
What's happening?

45:29.601 --> 45:31.034
When you walked out
on the runway,

45:31.034 --> 45:35.034
I checked my notes and all
I wrote was, "Fuck me."

45:35.034 --> 45:37.201
Okay. That can be arranged.

45:37.201 --> 45:39.034
You have taken an iconic actress

45:39.034 --> 45:42.568
who played an iconic character
on an iconic show,

45:42.568 --> 45:46.101
and you've served an iconic look
for Canada's Drag Race.

45:46.101 --> 45:48.201
Thank you.
Thank you.

45:48.201 --> 45:49.401
I mean, it's the polish for me.

45:49.401 --> 45:50.901
Like, did you make any of this?

45:50.901 --> 45:52.168
All the looks that you see,

45:52.168 --> 45:54.101
I basically
have made all of them.

45:54.101 --> 45:56.034
It's beautiful.
I love it.

45:56.034 --> 45:57.534
It's what I've come to expect from you.

45:58.834 --> 46:01.401
Thank you. While you join
your fellow queens

46:01.401 --> 46:03.101
in the werkroom,

46:03.101 --> 46:04.834
the judges will dodge
the paparazzi.

46:04.834 --> 46:06.568
-Please, no photos.
-No photos.

46:06.568 --> 46:08.534
-Speak for yourself.
-Right. Right here.

46:08.534 --> 46:10.034
[all laugh]

46:12.334 --> 46:13.401
Hello.

46:13.401 --> 46:16.568
-Ladies.
-Hi.

46:16.568 --> 46:18.934
-The tea is piping hot, ladies.
-I know.

46:18.934 --> 46:21.068
Adriana.

46:21.068 --> 46:22.168
Hi.

46:22.168 --> 46:23.868
How's it going over there, sweetie-honey?

46:23.868 --> 46:27.068
I just feel that I lost control.

46:27.068 --> 46:30.534
That just the first joke
that they didn't laugh,

46:30.534 --> 46:32.034
it just pfft.

46:32.034 --> 46:34.768
So it was a mess in my head.
I couldn't think straight.

46:34.768 --> 46:36.101
Miss Eve.

46:36.101 --> 46:38.668
-Yeah, how are you feeling?
-Yeah, girl, I'm ready to hear.

46:38.668 --> 46:41.768
One thing that I will say that, like,
actually pissed me off,

46:41.768 --> 46:44.101
Connor says
that my hair was flat.

46:44.101 --> 46:46.668
When somebody says something
that's just not true--

46:46.668 --> 46:47.534
He doesn't do drag, girl.

46:47.534 --> 46:50.768
Yeah. It's fine.
Don't take it personally.

46:50.768 --> 46:52.934
Eve thinks she's so amazing.

46:52.934 --> 46:54.868
It's another week of delusion.

46:54.868 --> 46:58.601
And if she's in the bottom,
I'm sorry, sister.

46:58.601 --> 46:59.834
Like, I don't care.

46:59.834 --> 47:02.168
Like, you gotta go.

47:02.168 --> 47:03.834
Girl, how are you feeling?

47:03.834 --> 47:05.668
I'm feeling fine.
To be honest, I'm very fine.

47:05.668 --> 47:08.534
You know what?
You go in choices, places,

47:08.534 --> 47:10.701
and you take your decisions,
you fucking stick to it.

47:10.701 --> 47:12.368
Yeah, and in life,
that's my approach.

47:12.368 --> 47:14.768
So I tried it,
it didn't work out, it's fine.

47:14.768 --> 47:16.568
Yoko was a choice.

47:16.568 --> 47:18.068
-It truly was.
-It was.

47:18.068 --> 47:21.201
How do you stay so positive
and optimistic?

47:21.201 --> 47:22.601
I come from the projects, right?

47:22.601 --> 47:25.901
So many kids do not get
a fighting chance,

47:25.901 --> 47:28.501
or any circumstances
that are validating for them.

47:28.501 --> 47:30.268
So what do you do
when you have the chance?

47:30.268 --> 47:32.668
You take it
and you cry about it?

47:32.668 --> 47:34.501
"Oh, I didn't get that,
what I wanted."

47:34.501 --> 47:36.201
That's privilege. I'm sorry.

47:36.201 --> 47:38.201
-No, you're right.
-I love that so much.

47:38.201 --> 47:40.501
Well, bitches, start paying!

47:40.501 --> 47:41.734
[all laugh]

47:41.734 --> 47:42.901
So you think this wig is free?

47:42.901 --> 47:44.101
Well, we're all gonna
try it on afterwards.

47:44.101 --> 47:45.368
-Oh!
-[laughs]

47:45.368 --> 47:47.001
When Eve puts it on,
it looks really flat.

47:47.001 --> 47:49.868
[all laugh]

47:49.868 --> 47:51.768
Like, somehow.

47:51.768 --> 47:54.434
Okay, so just between
us fame whores...

47:54.434 --> 47:56.101
[all laugh]

47:56.101 --> 47:57.034
What do we think?

47:57.034 --> 47:59.168
Let's start with Kimora Amour.

47:59.168 --> 48:01.368
-This runway tonight, you guys.
-Mm.

48:01.368 --> 48:03.734
The fact that
she made all of this,

48:03.734 --> 48:07.168
she is just a stunning queen.

48:07.168 --> 48:11.001
And I loved the speed
of her runway.

48:11.001 --> 48:12.734
[laughs]

48:12.734 --> 48:15.034
There was no rush,
there was no hurry.

48:15.034 --> 48:17.534
It just felt like
we were here for her.

48:17.534 --> 48:20.434
And Leslie Jones, I mean,
I know she played it big,

48:20.434 --> 48:23.768
but Leslie Jones
is a very big personality.

48:23.768 --> 48:25.601
I feel like this
is the start of her rise.

48:25.601 --> 48:27.034
-I agree.
-It's been very this,

48:27.034 --> 48:29.034
and now I feel like
she's finally taking off,

48:29.034 --> 48:30.668
and I'm so happy to see it.

48:30.668 --> 48:32.534
Synthia Kiss.

48:32.534 --> 48:35.434
That Snatch Game,
I was blown away.

48:35.434 --> 48:37.768
Like, she did not miss a beat.

48:37.768 --> 48:41.568
The way she interacted with you
and the other queens,

48:41.568 --> 48:42.601
I think that's really important,

48:42.601 --> 48:45.768
because you get a sense of improv
and being able to ad-lib.

48:45.768 --> 48:48.268
The look of her,
the sound of her,

48:48.268 --> 48:51.868
I felt like
I was back in, like, 2008

48:51.868 --> 48:54.034
in the studio with her.

48:54.034 --> 48:55.068
And then the Jeanne Beker--

48:55.068 --> 48:57.101
It definitely was
a Jeanne Beker-inspired runway,

48:57.101 --> 48:58.201
which was the assignment.

48:58.201 --> 48:59.168
She made it her own.

48:59.168 --> 49:02.668
She just exploded and became,
like, a star this week.

49:02.668 --> 49:04.768
Okay, let's talk about Eve.

49:04.768 --> 49:08.501
Looked like Bernie Sanders,
sounded like Bernie Sanders,

49:08.501 --> 49:10.168
but I didn't find it funny.

49:10.168 --> 49:12.234
The most important thing
that we've said over and over

49:12.234 --> 49:13.768
is "make us laugh."

49:13.768 --> 49:14.701
In her runway,

49:14.701 --> 49:17.668
she was trying really hard
to be full of energy,

49:17.668 --> 49:19.668
she was doing
the Matrix poses,

49:19.668 --> 49:20.534
but there was something

49:20.534 --> 49:22.434
that felt a little forced
to me about it.

49:22.434 --> 49:24.334
I always enjoy
Eve's runway look.

49:24.334 --> 49:26.501
It's just the spark
is not there.

49:26.501 --> 49:28.334
Last week was great,

49:28.334 --> 49:30.901
and I was thinking
she's turning a corner.

49:30.901 --> 49:35.068
But the problem is I'm just not sure
we can bring it out of her.

49:35.068 --> 49:36.068
Mm.

49:36.068 --> 49:38.368
All right, next up, Adriana.

49:38.368 --> 49:40.101
She had an idea
of where she wanted to go,

49:40.101 --> 49:43.201
and then she just lost her way.

49:43.201 --> 49:44.234
Yeah, I was also disappointed

49:44.234 --> 49:48.101
because what we have seen
from her is consistency,

49:48.101 --> 49:51.401
and her runways
are polished, chic.

49:51.401 --> 49:53.068
And we never know
what we're gonna get from her.

49:53.068 --> 49:54.234
-She won last week.
-Yeah.

49:54.234 --> 49:57.168
And she really
leaned into her kooky-isms.

49:57.168 --> 49:58.101
-Kooky-isms?
-Her kooky-isms.

49:58.101 --> 49:59.034
I like that.

49:59.034 --> 50:00.668
These are my kooky-isms.

50:00.668 --> 50:02.001
Where are my kooky-isms?

50:02.001 --> 50:05.168
-Yours are in your pants.
-Oh! Okay, thanks.

50:05.168 --> 50:07.668
All right, y'all, what
did you think of Pythia?

50:07.668 --> 50:11.001
As Grimes in the Snatch Game,
she knew what Grimes was about.

50:11.001 --> 50:13.334
She was kooky,
out of this world.

50:13.334 --> 50:14.868
Does she have kooky-isms, though?

50:14.868 --> 50:16.534
[all laugh]
Totally.

50:16.534 --> 50:20.201
When she came out, it was,
like, a burst of fun and energy.

50:20.201 --> 50:23.701
She loves to be, like,
funny and silly.

50:23.701 --> 50:26.934
Saying all that, I'd love to see
some other variations as well,

50:26.934 --> 50:29.934
because my gut instinct is
they're just as exciting

50:29.934 --> 50:33.101
and could really crack open
her drag so much more.

50:33.101 --> 50:35.001
Next up, Suki Doll.

50:35.001 --> 50:37.368
To do an homage to Sandra Oh

50:37.368 --> 50:38.768
in a trench
and a dress and heels

50:38.768 --> 50:41.834
with queens who are wearing
feathers and beading

50:41.834 --> 50:44.434
and still make an impact

50:44.434 --> 50:47.568
says a lot about
her ability to design.

50:47.568 --> 50:49.701
Another thing I really appreciate
about Suki

50:49.701 --> 50:50.934
is she makes me think.

50:50.934 --> 50:53.501
She makes me rethink
about what I think drag is,

50:53.501 --> 50:55.368
and what I should see on the runway
and what I shouldn't.

50:55.368 --> 50:58.434
It sort of felt like
A Tale of Two Cities with Suki.

50:58.434 --> 50:59.701
It was like,
it was the best of times

50:59.701 --> 51:01.201
and it was the worst of times.

51:01.201 --> 51:02.268
Very that.

51:02.268 --> 51:04.701
Because her runway look
was fashion,

51:04.701 --> 51:06.734
but the Snatch Game
was unfortunate.

51:06.734 --> 51:09.068
She got drowned out a lot.

51:09.068 --> 51:11.068
She wasn't able to stake
her Snatch Game claim.

51:11.068 --> 51:12.701
Yeah.

51:12.701 --> 51:14.601
Whew! This is a tough one,

51:14.601 --> 51:16.568
and we have
a big decision to make.

51:16.568 --> 51:19.001
Bring back our snatches
of the day.

51:19.001 --> 51:22.068
Welcome back, queens.

51:22.068 --> 51:23.534
We have made some decisions.

51:25.234 --> 51:27.034
Synthia Kiss.

51:27.034 --> 51:29.201
On the runway,
we saw your glow,

51:29.201 --> 51:33.068
and in the Snatch Game,
your Rachel Zoe stole the show.

51:35.534 --> 51:36.534
Con-drag-ulations.

51:36.534 --> 51:39.434
You are the winner
of this week's maxi-challenge.

51:39.434 --> 51:41.101
Aah!
[applause]

51:41.101 --> 51:44.501
You have won $5.000
in cash money

51:44.501 --> 51:46.734
thanks to our friends at Made.

51:46.734 --> 51:49.034
Oh, bitch!

51:49.034 --> 51:50.568
Thanks, Made!

51:50.568 --> 51:52.668
You may join the other queens.

51:52.668 --> 51:54.101
Thank you so much.

51:54.101 --> 51:55.401
This is amazing.

51:55.401 --> 51:57.701
[applause]

51:57.701 --> 52:00.501
[imitating Rachel Zoe]
Thank you so much for letting me win.

52:00.501 --> 52:03.001
I think it feels correct.

52:03.001 --> 52:05.101
[laughs]

52:06.601 --> 52:09.368
Pythia and Kimora Amour,

52:09.368 --> 52:11.568
fantastic work this week.

52:11.568 --> 52:14.201
You are both safe.

52:14.201 --> 52:15.401
Thank you so much.

52:15.401 --> 52:17.101
You may head
to the back of the stage.

52:20.268 --> 52:21.368
Suki Doll.

52:21.368 --> 52:24.201
You always
bring it on the runway,

52:24.201 --> 52:25.934
but in the Snatch Game,

52:25.934 --> 52:29.034
your Yoko Ono
was a Yoko, oh, no.

52:31.001 --> 52:33.901
I'm so sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

52:35.768 --> 52:37.034
Adriana.

52:37.034 --> 52:40.034
On the runway,
we liked what you created,

52:40.034 --> 52:43.068
but in the Snatch Game,
you completely deflated.

52:44.834 --> 52:46.401
Eve 6000.

52:46.401 --> 52:49.234
Your runway look
wasn't a concern,

52:49.234 --> 52:53.934
but in the Snatch Game,
we did not feel the Bern.

52:53.934 --> 52:57.001
I'm sorry to say, but you
are up for elimination.

52:58.934 --> 53:02.901
Adriana, you are safe.

53:02.901 --> 53:04.201
You may join the other queens.

53:04.201 --> 53:06.834
Thank you so much.

53:08.368 --> 53:10.168
Love you. Mwah.

53:13.234 --> 53:16.168
Two queens stand before us.

53:19.168 --> 53:20.601
Prior to tonight,
you were asked

53:20.601 --> 53:24.768
to prepare a lip sync performance
of Happiness.

53:24.768 --> 53:27.734
Ladies, this
is your last chance

53:27.734 --> 53:32.068
to impress the judges and
save yourself from elimination.

53:35.101 --> 53:37.068
The time has come...
[thunder]

53:37.068 --> 53:39.234
for you to lip sync...

53:39.234 --> 53:42.101
for your life.

53:43.268 --> 53:45.001
[exhales]

53:45.001 --> 53:48.201
Typical Suki.
She's very positive.

53:48.201 --> 53:51.001
I love her so much,
but I'm coming for blood.

53:51.001 --> 53:54.568
Ooh, let's sing, babies.

53:54.568 --> 53:56.601
Let's bust some moves.

53:56.601 --> 54:00.368
Good luck, and don't fuck it up.

56:34.934 --> 56:37.901
Queens, we've made our decision.

56:41.101 --> 56:42.401
Eve 6000.

56:44.201 --> 56:46.268
Shantay you stay.

56:46.268 --> 56:50.201
You may join the other queens.

56:50.201 --> 56:52.701
[cries]

57:00.401 --> 57:05.201
Suki, my high-fashion queen.

57:05.201 --> 57:06.768
C'est moi.

57:06.768 --> 57:10.434
You are one who always
rules the runway,

57:10.434 --> 57:14.001
and now you're ready
to rule the world.

57:14.001 --> 57:16.934
You will forever be our doll.

57:16.934 --> 57:20.001
Now sashay away.

57:20.001 --> 57:22.234
Thank you so much
for the platform,

57:22.234 --> 57:25.168
uplifting the drag queens,
and giving us voice.

57:25.168 --> 57:27.368
You have been
such a blessing to us.

57:27.368 --> 57:28.701
-We love you.
-Thank you.

57:28.701 --> 57:30.101
Love you.

57:32.001 --> 57:33.901
Love you, sisters.
[applause]

57:33.901 --> 57:35.268
Don't you guys cry.

57:35.268 --> 57:36.601
You know you look ugly
when you cry.

57:39.001 --> 57:40.434
A wise Suki once said,

57:40.434 --> 57:43.434
all drag is valid,
and boys in skirt is a yes.

57:43.434 --> 57:45.201
So keep that in mind,

57:45.201 --> 57:48.001
and never put your foot forward
with prejudice.

57:48.001 --> 57:49.068
Love you, my sisters.

57:49.068 --> 57:50.568
-Love you!
-Love you so much!

57:52.168 --> 57:56.934
I'm feeling resolved, and
I've done want I wanted to do,

57:56.934 --> 57:58.501
put my mark where I wanted to.

57:58.501 --> 58:03.001
My advice to the world:
Don't take things too seriously,

58:03.001 --> 58:04.401
eat stress for breakfast,

58:04.401 --> 58:08.001
and whenever
you step out there, fashion.

58:08.001 --> 58:09.068
It's a Suki moment.

58:10.901 --> 58:12.268
Big lips.

58:14.934 --> 58:17.034
Con-drag-ulations, ladies.

58:17.034 --> 58:19.768
You've lived
to slay another day.

58:19.768 --> 58:24.101
And remember, stay true north,
strong, and fierce.
