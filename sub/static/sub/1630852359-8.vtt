and I can't think of a better
place to learn to ride.

20:04.420 --> 20:07.423
You come with me, I ain't
gonna baby you like he did.

20:09.599 --> 20:12.036
You're gonna work
and you're gonna keep up,

20:12.123 --> 20:14.561
'cause I ain't crossing
the mountains in the snow

20:14.648 --> 20:16.171
and I ain't winterin'
at no fort.

20:17.520 --> 20:18.652
- You're gonna
get 'em all killed.

20:20.610 --> 20:23.047
- Well, people die
in Denver, too.

20:23.134 --> 20:25.093
It's their choice.

20:25.180 --> 20:27.617
The question is:

20:27.704 --> 20:29.445
what are you going to do
when they make it?

20:35.538 --> 20:36.974
What's it gonna be?

20:43.459 --> 20:44.417
- We go with you.

20:47.811 --> 20:49.204
- We head out in the morning.

20:50.336 --> 20:51.380
Come ready.

20:53.513 --> 20:55.645
[Josef speaking German]

21:02.043 --> 21:03.392
- I don't want to leave.

21:08.005 --> 21:08.702
- You want to stay.

21:11.661 --> 21:13.054
- I don't need
to see mountains.

21:17.754 --> 21:19.408
- Mountains are worth seeing.

21:21.323 --> 21:22.324
- You saying
I should go?

21:24.631 --> 21:26.328
- I'm saying mountains
are worth seeing.

21:32.769 --> 21:35.468
But you don't need wagons
to see them.

21:35.555 --> 21:36.556
I can take you.

21:38.384 --> 21:40.037
[music]

21:44.955 --> 21:45.913
- It's settled.

21:47.218 --> 21:48.263
You'll take me then.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.320
Where are you going?

22:06.150 --> 22:07.413
- I must offer
your father something.

22:10.503 --> 22:11.504
- For what?

22:12.853 --> 22:13.854
- For you.

22:16.813 --> 22:19.076
[music]

22:53.763 --> 22:54.677
- Buffalo.

22:56.418 --> 22:58.768
[speaking Comanche]

23:07.908 --> 23:11.346
- Everywhere you go,
a blessing follows.

23:13.130 --> 23:17.439
You know how to steal horses.

23:17.526 --> 23:20.268
Now I teach you to hunt..

[speaking Comanche]

24:43.220 --> 24:44.439
Eat.

24:47.529 --> 24:49.096
Bite into it.

His strength is your strength.

[music]

26:18.185 --> 26:20.535
- What have you done?

26:20.622 --> 26:21.318
- I killed a buffalo.

26:43.036 --> 26:45.168
- You packed up?

26:45.255 --> 26:46.909
- No, Captain.

26:46.996 --> 26:49.520
- Better get to it.

26:49.608 --> 26:50.652
- Ain't gonna do it.

26:51.827 --> 26:53.655
I promised I'd see her to Oregon

26:55.788 --> 26:56.832
and that's what I'm gonna do.

27:00.706 --> 27:04.927
- Well, free country.

27:05.014 --> 27:08.061
- It's gonna be hard enough
with you,

27:08.148 --> 27:09.715
but we ain't got
no chance without you.

27:12.065 --> 27:15.459
I ain't ever
asked you for nothing

27:15.546 --> 27:17.548
but I'm asking you now.

27:17.636 --> 27:18.898
Don't leave us, Captain.

27:21.901 --> 27:23.206
Elsa: Where you going?

27:27.167 --> 27:29.473
- What happened to you.

27:29.560 --> 27:31.954
- I killed a buffalo.

27:32.041 --> 27:33.521
We ate its heart
to keep its strength.

27:35.436 --> 27:36.567
Where you going?

27:38.221 --> 27:39.005
- Oregon, honey.

27:41.224 --> 27:42.225
With you.

27:44.488 --> 27:46.752
- I'm not going to Oregon.

27:46.839 --> 27:47.927
I'm staying here.

27:55.543 --> 27:56.718
Margaret: What time we pull out?

27:58.807 --> 28:02.115
James: First light.

28:02.202 --> 28:04.683
No more crack
of 9 am for this outfit.

28:04.770 --> 28:07.990
- New sheriff in town ain't
gonna take it anymore, huh.

28:08.077 --> 28:09.557
- Not if we're
gonna beat winter.

28:12.952 --> 28:14.518
- Let's talk
about your daughter.

28:14.605 --> 28:18.044
- Uh oh, she's mine again.

28:18.131 --> 28:19.915
What did she do?

28:20.002 --> 28:24.093
- Ran off with that
Comanche boy, killed a buffalo.

28:24.180 --> 28:27.009
Mm-hmm. Came back, her
face covered in blood

28:27.096 --> 28:28.532
'cause I guess they ate half
of it in the field.

28:28.619 --> 28:29.925
[chuckles]

28:32.536 --> 28:36.410
- Go ahead and laugh.
She is feral.

28:36.497 --> 28:38.325
You always talked
about how you'd raise our boys

28:38.412 --> 28:41.197
to be men
and you started with her.

28:41.284 --> 28:43.330
When we get back
to any form of civilization

28:43.417 --> 28:45.245
I'm gonna have to undo
all of that.

28:45.332 --> 28:46.855
- Do you really want to?

28:46.942 --> 28:48.727
- Oh, please.
James...

28:48.814 --> 28:50.380
Let me deal with one
dreamer at a time.

28:53.644 --> 28:57.039
- You're a dreamer, too.

28:57.126 --> 28:58.824
You wouldn't be with me
if you weren't.

28:58.911 --> 29:00.869
- I'm a believer, honey.
There's a difference.

29:02.915 --> 29:04.830
- Fair enough.

29:19.496 --> 29:21.237
- It's for you.

29:21.324 --> 29:22.848
- Why is it for me?

29:26.155 --> 29:28.723
- Whatcha doin'?

29:28.810 --> 29:30.769
- I'm trading these things.

29:30.856 --> 29:33.293
Got no use for 'em anymore.

29:33.380 --> 29:36.252
James: Elsa.

29:36.339 --> 29:39.865
- Stay in here.
You don't want to see this.

29:52.573 --> 29:53.922
- Are you aware
of what he's asking?

29:55.402 --> 29:56.272
- I'm aware.

29:59.798 --> 30:02.148
Take the horse, daddy.

30:02.235 --> 30:03.497
- Young lady,
I will not allow this.

30:06.848 --> 30:09.808
- You're not allowing it?

30:09.895 --> 30:11.897
I'm eighteen years old.

30:11.984 --> 30:14.551
I'm allowing it.

30:14.638 --> 30:16.292
- You think being
18 makes you a woman?

30:17.816 --> 30:18.686
- Law thinks it does.

30:23.909 --> 30:27.347
[music]

30:37.139 --> 30:38.837
- Don't just stand there.
Stop him.

30:41.317 --> 30:42.536
Shoot him.

30:46.496 --> 30:48.063
Do something!

31:08.431 --> 31:10.433
- I understood
my mother's worry.

31:10.520 --> 31:13.132
My choices make no sense
in her world,

31:13.219 --> 31:17.745
where customs and prejudice
rule, where law cannot reach.

31:17.832 --> 31:21.618
There will be customs and
prejudice here too, I'm sure.

31:21.705 --> 31:25.535
But they were born
of this world and belong in it.

31:25.622 --> 31:29.104
To import the traditions
of the place you fled,

31:29.191 --> 31:31.541
the place that failed you,

31:31.628 --> 31:35.328
is to condemn the place you
seek with the same failures.

31:37.765 --> 31:40.028
[music]

31:47.035 --> 31:48.994
- We saw your daughter.

31:49.081 --> 31:51.213
Cookie thought you might want
a swig or two of this.

31:56.958 --> 31:59.265
- I guess she's gonna
fall in love with every man

31:59.352 --> 32:00.744
she meets till
one of them sticks.

32:07.838 --> 32:11.059
- Hell, I don't know.

32:11.146 --> 32:13.148
- After a night or two
without you,

32:13.235 --> 32:15.237
I bet she'll point that
fast horse north

32:15.324 --> 32:17.892
and catch us
before we leave Kansas.

32:17.979 --> 32:18.937
- You don't know my daughter.

32:23.593 --> 32:25.334
So, no Denver for you.

32:25.421 --> 32:27.554
- These folks don't
trust me anymore.

32:27.641 --> 32:29.686
And I don't
trust them for making

32:29.773 --> 32:31.775
a right choice for themselves.

32:31.862 --> 32:34.517
Can't lead people
I don't trust.

32:34.604 --> 32:35.997
But you trust them.

32:36.084 --> 32:37.868
- They came a long way.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.479
I trust their desire
to see it through.

32:41.437 --> 32:43.613
- I'm gonna trust you.

32:43.700 --> 32:45.441
I think I can
live with that.

32:45.528 --> 32:48.053
But you're gonna
have to lead 'em.

32:48.140 --> 32:50.403
I'll guide 'em and I'll
protect 'em, but you lead them.

32:52.361 --> 32:52.971
- I can do that.

32:55.321 --> 32:56.539
- I'm gonna leave
that with you.

32:56.626 --> 32:57.932
- Hell, no.

32:58.019 --> 32:59.673
I'm liable to crawl in
the son of a bitch

32:59.760 --> 33:01.849
trying to figure out
what to do with that girl.

33:01.936 --> 33:04.808
- It's looking like you might
have to trust her too, James.

33:04.895 --> 33:06.636
[music]

33:16.211 --> 33:17.865
[music]

33:57.035 --> 33:58.993
- I barely recognize you.

33:59.080 --> 34:02.910
- Barely recognize me either.

34:02.997 --> 34:04.129
And I'm happier for it.

34:06.740 --> 34:08.568
What's the worst that
could happen to me, mama?

34:08.655 --> 34:10.613
- Mark my words,
you will get hurt.

34:10.700 --> 34:12.311
- How many dead lovers
have you laid against?

34:14.052 --> 34:15.792
I've been plenty hurt.

34:15.879 --> 34:17.446
- Don't talk to me about love.

34:17.533 --> 34:19.579
You barely understand
the concept.

34:19.666 --> 34:22.321
I worked a sharecropper
farm for three years,

34:22.408 --> 34:25.715
pregnant with you, while your
father lay rotting

34:25.802 --> 34:27.065
in a war prison.

34:27.152 --> 34:29.241
- And how old were you then?
- Seventeen.

34:29.328 --> 34:30.546
- Somehow you knew
love at my age,

34:30.633 --> 34:32.374
but I don't
understand the concept.

34:32.461 --> 34:34.942
- It's different.
- It's not different.

34:35.029 --> 34:36.813
It's exactly the same.

34:36.900 --> 34:38.598
- Here's the difference.

34:38.685 --> 34:41.775
You are my child.
When you fall down, and you will

34:41.862 --> 34:44.430
it is my duty to pick you up.

34:44.517 --> 34:46.649
I can't do that if
I don't know where you are,

34:46.736 --> 34:48.086
and if I don't know
what you've become.

34:50.653 --> 34:52.177
- It's not your duty
anymore, mother.

34:53.526 --> 34:54.570
I love you.

34:56.311 --> 34:57.660
But I'm a woman.

34:57.747 --> 34:58.966
I pick myself up.

35:03.188 --> 35:06.147
I'll ride with you to Oregon,

35:06.234 --> 35:08.628
then I know where to come if I
ever need a place to start over.

35:11.196 --> 35:15.243
Or maybe I'll just visit,
bring your grandchildren.

35:23.686 --> 35:24.383
- So, um...

35:27.299 --> 35:28.778
Is there...

35:28.865 --> 35:30.911
Some form of ceremony?

35:30.998 --> 35:32.391
- No ceremony.

35:37.135 --> 35:39.920
- All I ask, have a ceremony.

35:42.836 --> 35:46.361
Say vows before God...

35:46.448 --> 35:48.189
so this
at least has a chance.

35:48.276 --> 35:51.801
- He saved my life.

35:51.888 --> 35:54.326
Twice.

35:54.413 --> 35:57.024
Saved your husband's life too.

35:57.111 --> 36:01.724
I don't need to ask
God's permission to love him.

36:01.811 --> 36:03.291
God sent him.

36:05.598 --> 36:07.600
[music]

36:49.772 --> 36:50.991
- How you doing there?

36:51.078 --> 36:54.342
- He goes where he wants.
Not where I say.

36:54.429 --> 36:56.214
- Horse goes where you look.

36:56.301 --> 36:57.389
You're looking at his head.

36:57.476 --> 36:59.173
He don't know how to go there.

36:59.260 --> 37:00.305
Look up at the cattle.

37:04.918 --> 37:05.962
There you go.

37:08.487 --> 37:10.402
- What if I want to look at you?

37:10.489 --> 37:15.755
- You can look anywhere you want
now, he knows where he's going.

37:15.842 --> 37:18.366
- You just say he goes
where I look,

37:18.453 --> 37:21.064
now you're saying
I can look anywhere.

37:21.151 --> 37:24.024
- 'Cause he knows
where he's going.

37:24.111 --> 37:25.286
- You make no sense.

37:26.592 --> 37:27.854
- [chuckles]

37:29.812 --> 37:31.510
Pretty good way
to travel, huh?

37:33.381 --> 37:34.252
- I'm terrified.

37:38.168 --> 37:40.693
- Now that you
got the steering figured,

37:40.780 --> 37:44.044
it's time you find yer seat.

37:44.131 --> 37:45.350
- How do I find my seat?

37:45.437 --> 37:47.090
Ah!

37:49.223 --> 37:51.356
[speaking German]

37:51.443 --> 37:53.488
- Stop speaking German.
We're American now.

37:55.447 --> 37:57.579
- Is it okay?
The horse?

37:57.666 --> 37:58.406
[kisses]

38:04.194 --> 38:05.848
- Your turn next.

38:05.935 --> 38:07.502
- No, no, not me.

38:07.589 --> 38:10.157
- Yes, you.
You will be a cowboy.

38:10.244 --> 38:13.378
- You be the cowboy.
I drive the wagon.

38:17.077 --> 38:18.992
[woman screams]

38:32.135 --> 38:35.922
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:36.009 --> 38:38.794
- You got to keep your
feet off his flanks.

38:38.881 --> 38:40.405
That's like tickling
you under the arm.

38:40.492 --> 38:41.928
You're gonna run
from the tickle.

38:42.015 --> 38:43.146
So will he.

38:43.233 --> 38:44.104
- They're learning.

38:44.191 --> 38:46.541
- Yeah, I'm watching the lesson.

38:46.628 --> 38:47.934
And it is skunk ugly.

38:48.978 --> 38:50.110
[laughs]

38:55.811 --> 38:58.727
- There's good water up here.
Good place to rest.

38:58.814 --> 39:00.294
Good place to break
that stallion.

39:00.381 --> 39:02.688
- What the hell's water got
to do with breaking a horse?

39:02.775 --> 39:03.906
- I'll show you
when we get there.

39:03.993 --> 39:05.560
- Come on.

39:05.647 --> 39:08.520
- Come on. Hup, hup, hup.

39:08.607 --> 39:10.565
- Lightning
with the Yellow Hair.

39:10.652 --> 39:11.436
You think you can catch me?

[music]

39:36.112 --> 39:39.420
[German and Slavic chatter]

39:44.730 --> 39:46.296
- You're going to cook it?

39:46.384 --> 39:49.256
- Naw, I'm gonna
make sandals out of it.

39:49.343 --> 39:51.650
- You expect us to eat that?

39:51.737 --> 39:53.652
- Don't they got
deer where you're from?

39:53.739 --> 39:55.262
- Pigs.

39:55.349 --> 39:57.090
- Pigs?

39:57.177 --> 40:01.224
A pig is one of the
nastiest animals on this planet.

40:01.311 --> 40:05.228
You are what you eat
and a pig will eat anything.

40:05.315 --> 40:06.795
Like a raccoon.

40:06.882 --> 40:08.971
- What does deer eat?

40:09.058 --> 40:10.625
- Grass.

40:10.712 --> 40:12.235
- What does deer taste like?

40:15.674 --> 40:19.460
- What does deer taste like?

40:19.547 --> 40:21.419
It tastes like this place.

40:21.506 --> 40:24.117
And the grass and the dirt

40:24.204 --> 40:26.772
and the water from the creek
over there all mixed together.

40:26.859 --> 40:29.078
- You eat dirt?
- So do you.

40:29.165 --> 40:30.732
Every meal.

40:30.819 --> 40:32.430
If you really want me to
bake yer biscuit,

40:32.517 --> 40:37.043
think about this: one
day yer gonna be dirt.

40:38.653 --> 40:41.526
[speaks Croatian]

40:41.613 --> 40:44.267
- Dirt? When will
they be dirt?

40:44.354 --> 40:47.053
- Depends on when they
go in the ground, ma'am.

40:47.140 --> 40:48.184
[muttering in Croatian]
Cookie: Don't it?

40:52.232 --> 40:53.494

He's broke now.

42:20.755 --> 42:23.105
- [laughs]

42:23.192 --> 42:25.368
Naw, he's a couple weeks
from being broke.

42:25.455 --> 42:27.762
- He's broke. Run him.

42:27.849 --> 42:29.198
If you want him to give you
his heart, you must run him.

42:35.988 --> 42:39.382
[music]

43:19.858 --> 43:21.729
- This place is beautiful.

43:29.476 --> 43:30.651
- That's where she gets it from.

43:33.175 --> 43:34.089
- Where who gets what?

43:35.613 --> 43:36.831
- Your sister.

43:38.528 --> 43:39.747
- What did she get?

43:41.053 --> 43:42.271
- Her spirit.

43:43.490 --> 43:45.623
- What's a spirit?

43:45.710 --> 43:46.798
- The thing that drives you.

43:48.408 --> 43:50.149
- What drives me?

43:52.717 --> 43:54.022
- I don't know yet, honey.

43:55.328 --> 43:56.851
- What drives Elsa?

43:59.462 --> 44:00.986
- Hmmm... The wind.

44:02.596 --> 44:04.250
[clicks tongue]

44:04.337 --> 44:05.033
- Ya!

44:23.922 --> 44:25.053
- Strong.

44:25.140 --> 44:25.837
Fast...

44:27.534 --> 44:28.491
- A good horse for war,
that one.

44:33.453 --> 44:34.497
- Where will she live?

44:39.328 --> 44:41.461
- My land is with
Quanah Parker.

44:41.548 --> 44:42.984
South of the Wichita Mountains.

44:43.071 --> 44:47.510
I will build her a house
if that's what she wants, but...

44:47.597 --> 44:49.817
I think she would rather
chase bandits with me.

44:49.904 --> 44:50.862
- She would.

44:52.994 --> 44:54.909
But she's young.

44:54.996 --> 44:56.650
The young change their minds.

44:58.565 --> 44:59.740
What if she changes
her mind about you?

45:02.047 --> 45:03.788
- Then I will bring
her back to you.

45:03.875 --> 45:05.964
- How will you find me?

45:08.096 --> 45:09.924
- White men think the world
is so big

45:10.011 --> 45:11.883
because you fight against it
when you travel.

45:11.970 --> 45:13.623
We move with it.
Like the wolf.

45:16.322 --> 45:17.149
It is small to us.

45:19.238 --> 45:19.934
I will find you.

45:22.284 --> 45:24.809
- No chance you'd
want to come to Oregon?

45:24.896 --> 45:26.811
- I fought too hard
for what land we have left.

45:28.987 --> 45:30.118
Doubt the fighting's over.

45:33.600 --> 45:35.950
I marry your daughter, but
I still belong to the people

45:36.037 --> 45:37.386
and the people belong
to this land.

45:40.041 --> 45:42.261
We don't dare leave it.

45:42.348 --> 45:44.045
Maybe some day you find
land to belong to,

45:44.132 --> 45:45.438
and you'll know what I mean.

46:05.110 --> 46:07.721
- I could make her go with us.

46:07.808 --> 46:09.244
- How you gonna do that?

46:09.331 --> 46:11.812
If you tie her to
the back of the wagon

46:11.899 --> 46:13.988
she'll just chew
through that damn rope.

46:16.295 --> 46:18.950
She said she'd ride
with us to Oregon

46:19.037 --> 46:20.516
then come back to him
in the spring.

46:24.172 --> 46:25.870
Let's just hope she falls
in love in Oregon.

46:27.262 --> 46:28.786
- With the pattern
she's established

46:28.873 --> 46:30.091
she'll fall in love
again by Nebraska.

46:30.178 --> 46:31.789

46:34.487 --> 46:36.141
- It's not funny.

46:36.228 --> 46:37.882
- You're the one laughing.

46:40.362 --> 46:40.928
- You think our daughter
is the only one out here

46:41.015 --> 46:42.321
falling in love?

46:42.408 --> 46:44.018
I bet there's emigrant
kids fooling around

46:44.105 --> 46:45.628
behind every bush
along this creek.

46:48.370 --> 46:49.502
Ours just doesn't hide it.

46:51.417 --> 46:53.941
If she loves something
she will hold its hand

46:54.028 --> 46:55.073
in front of the whole world.

46:58.859 --> 47:00.078
- She gets that from you.

47:03.298 --> 47:05.083
- She gets racing up
that hill from me.

47:08.913 --> 47:10.305
But the way she loves...

47:13.700 --> 47:15.093
she gets that from you.

47:16.398 --> 47:17.835
That's why it scares you so bad.

47:19.445 --> 47:20.489
- You're not scared?

47:23.928 --> 47:27.845
- My fear is selfish.

47:31.979 --> 47:33.067
I just want to be with her.

47:37.332 --> 47:38.768
- Yeah.

47:38.856 --> 47:40.074
- Know her children
when she has 'em.

47:44.209 --> 47:46.254
But I...

47:46.341 --> 47:47.821
can't alter the course
of her life

47:50.519 --> 47:52.130
just because of how bad
I'm gonna miss her.

47:53.827 --> 47:54.872
- She'll change her mind.

48:07.014 --> 48:09.582
- How do you say "I love you?"

48:13.455 --> 48:15.893
- Kah-Muk-Kun-Tun Nuh.

48:18.373 --> 48:21.463
- Kah-Mah-Kun-Tun Nuh.
- Kah-Mah-Kun-Tun Nuh.

48:24.771 --> 48:25.772
- Pretty good.

48:27.208 --> 48:28.470
- How do you say my name?

- At least we have
a path to follow.

51:34.221 --> 51:35.744
- How far to Fort Caspar?

51:35.831 --> 51:37.137
- Couple a weeks.

51:37.224 --> 51:39.792
We just might pull this off.

51:39.879 --> 51:41.402
- We meet here
when the flowers bloom.

51:41.489 --> 51:43.317
- When do the flowers bloom?

51:43.404 --> 51:45.972
- In your new home it's April.

51:46.059 --> 51:47.234
Here it is June.

51:48.583 --> 51:49.671
- I'll meet you here in June.

53:14.887 --> 53:21.676

53:21.763 --> 53:24.375
- I felt their
eyes move over me.

53:24.462 --> 53:26.942
Felt their pity
and disapproval...

53:27.029 --> 53:29.554
And it meant nothing to me.

53:29.641 --> 53:33.645
The only thing that mattered
was riding away,

53:33.732 --> 53:35.299
just as I was riding
away from him.

53:37.388 --> 53:39.955
As I pondered
the new journey before me,

53:40.042 --> 53:42.131
making it back to him.

53:42.219 --> 53:45.657
They watched the tears run
my cheeks and I let them.

53:47.789 --> 53:51.097
I didn't turn my face
or wipe them away.

53:51.184 --> 53:53.447
Tears we can't control,

53:53.534 --> 53:56.494
sobs and weeps
are little surrenders,

53:56.581 --> 53:59.584
and I will surrender
nothing to the pain.

53:59.671 --> 54:04.284
Tears may flow,
but I will not weep.

54:04.371 --> 54:08.245
I am the wife of a warrior now.

54:08.332 --> 54:12.510
Which is to say,
I am a warrior.

54:12.597 --> 54:14.947
And warriors don't cry.
