02:17.184 --> 02:18.549
Whoa!

02:21.688 --> 02:23.519
Ah!

04:32.252 --> 04:34.345
May I say, Dan,

04:34.387 --> 04:36.514
ever since I resumed
drinking alcohoI,

04:36.556 --> 04:38.456
I cannot for
the life of me

04:38.491 --> 04:40.152
figure out why
I ever gave it up.

04:40.193 --> 04:42.525
- Takes the edge off the tough ones.
- Ooh.

04:42.562 --> 04:45.190
Takes the edge off.
Well put.

04:45.231 --> 04:46.823
And may I say, Dan,

04:46.866 --> 04:49.130
that I often find you
the source of many

04:49.169 --> 04:51.831
well put and witty things
that you say.

04:51.871 --> 04:53.498
Thanks.

04:53.540 --> 04:55.030
The Hickok murder,

04:55.075 --> 04:57.737
exoneration
of the coward McCall,

04:57.777 --> 05:00.905
stain on the escutcheon
of the camp.

05:03.516 --> 05:05.416
Doc, libation!

05:07.654 --> 05:11.090
I wonder if he thought
I said "live patient?"

05:14.761 --> 05:16.228
Couldn't get it up.

05:16.262 --> 05:18.059
Give her
a dollar to wait.

05:18.098 --> 05:20.293
But he just keeps
getting sicker.

05:20.333 --> 05:22.426
Shut up!

05:22.469 --> 05:24.767
Come talk to me
after, Doc.

05:26.406 --> 05:28.374
My back hurts so bad.

05:47.560 --> 05:49.858
Will you keep
a girI company?

05:49.896 --> 05:52.763
I will,
but I'm expensive.

05:54.167 --> 05:56.135
Oh, I knew that
looking at you.

05:56.169 --> 05:58.433
I'm Joanie.

05:58.471 --> 06:00.632
Ellsworth.

06:00.674 --> 06:03.199
First visit to the Bella Union,
Ellsworth?

06:03.243 --> 06:04.767
Yes, ma'am.

06:04.811 --> 06:07.473
My leisure time's usually
spent at The Gem.

06:07.514 --> 06:09.573
What fills the rest
of your time?

06:09.616 --> 06:13.017
Well, ma'am, I've got myself
a working gold claim.

06:13.053 --> 06:15.453
Well, sir,
is that a damn fact?

06:15.488 --> 06:17.615
Yes, ma'am, a hell of
a working gold claim.

06:17.657 --> 06:19.557
And if we knew
each other better,

06:19.592 --> 06:21.560
I would throw fucking
in there somewhere.

06:21.594 --> 06:23.721
If you did,
I would try to catch it.

06:23.763 --> 06:27.426
A working, fucking
gold claim, Joanie.

06:27.467 --> 06:30.834
And thank you for allowing me
my full range of expression.

06:32.272 --> 06:34.706
- Ellsworth.
- What?

06:34.741 --> 06:36.470
Do you shoot craps?

06:36.509 --> 06:37.999
No, I don't.

06:38.044 --> 06:40.638
But I'm a lethally
quick study.

06:40.680 --> 06:42.409
Come on.

06:56.062 --> 06:57.689
Joey?

06:57.731 --> 06:59.323
I'm sick, boss.

06:59.365 --> 07:00.832
I ain't right.

07:00.867 --> 07:02.960
Keep your voice down.
Walk this way.

07:03.002 --> 07:04.526
I would never've
made Nebraska.

07:04.571 --> 07:06.539
I got fever.

07:06.573 --> 07:08.541
My back's hurt
something awfuI.

07:08.575 --> 07:10.907
All right, son, lay up
till you get better.

07:12.512 --> 07:14.503
Here's that
list you give me.

07:14.547 --> 07:15.946
You hold it for awhile.

07:15.982 --> 07:19.247
Fella who could read
said one of the items was for smallpox.

07:19.285 --> 07:21.219
What are you doing showing
that list around?

07:21.254 --> 07:23.245
Well, when I got
poorly by Buffalo Gap

07:23.289 --> 07:25.280
I wanted to see
if I could fill the list there.

07:25.325 --> 07:27.316
That's a breach
of goddamned trust!

07:28.361 --> 07:30.659
Have I got smallpox,
Mr. Tolliver?

07:30.697 --> 07:33.029
How do I know?
Maybe you got yourself a dose.

07:33.066 --> 07:35.500
No, I-I wouldn't.
I'm virgin.

07:35.535 --> 07:38.163
That's how come I jumped when you
told about Nebraska pussy.

07:38.204 --> 07:40.195
Anyway, go lay up.

07:46.746 --> 07:48.646
Joey didn't
make Nebraska?

07:48.681 --> 07:52.412
Come down with whatever
ailed Andy Cramed.

07:52.452 --> 07:55.250
I wonder if Joey was
after a remedy for Andy?

07:55.288 --> 07:57.222
Maybe without even knowing.

07:57.257 --> 07:58.952
Ain't you clever,
Eddie?

07:58.992 --> 08:01.859
Was I being clever? I thought I was
worrying about the plague.

08:01.895 --> 08:05.729
Why don't you concentrate on running
in the bones on Joanie's mark?

08:05.765 --> 08:07.756
A welcome diversion.

08:15.175 --> 08:17.939
Woman lives
in your fucking hoteI,

08:17.977 --> 08:20.309
but you can't find
pretext for pressing

08:20.346 --> 08:21.608
the offer on her claim?

08:21.648 --> 08:23.741
I can't out flank
Trixie, Al.

08:23.783 --> 08:26.513
The whore guards that
widow like a mother hen.

08:26.553 --> 08:29.750
She's dosed her with opium
priming her for your approach.

08:29.789 --> 08:32.417
- Be that as it may-
- E.B., put that offer in your pocket.

08:32.457 --> 08:34.722
- You knock on the widow's door.
- But Trixie'll answer.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.991
Trixie answers,
you tell her I want to talk to her.

08:37.030 --> 08:39.464
Trixie leaves, you gain entry,
broach the sale.

08:39.499 --> 08:41.990
Can you circumnavigate
the child

08:42.034 --> 08:44.560
or must I map
that for you, too?

08:44.604 --> 08:46.071
What?

08:46.105 --> 08:48.073
Nothing.

08:48.107 --> 08:50.075
Come on in, Doc,
him and me are finished.

08:50.109 --> 08:53.442
Don't play that shit where you make
me drag your words outta you.

08:53.479 --> 08:55.106
Declare,
or shut the fuck up!

08:55.148 --> 08:58.606
I said something strange
is going on in that hoteI room.

09:01.688 --> 09:04.156
It's bad with that
fella downstairs, Al.

09:04.190 --> 09:06.488
Plague, is it?

09:06.526 --> 09:08.016
Smallpox.

09:08.061 --> 09:09.790
Would land
in my joint.

09:09.829 --> 09:12.229
Yours wasn't
the first.

09:14.534 --> 09:16.798
No deceit
too prolonged.

09:16.836 --> 09:18.963
No errand too demeaning.
Get outta here!

09:19.005 --> 09:22.497
No rebuke too vile.

09:22.542 --> 09:26.501
Al Swearengen's a cue
and Farnum merely is...

09:26.546 --> 09:28.241
a billiard ball.

09:28.281 --> 09:30.010
Howdy.

09:31.951 --> 09:33.714
Shit!

09:33.753 --> 09:36.813
Quagmire of piss
and bullshit!

09:43.663 --> 09:45.028
What?

09:45.064 --> 09:47.362
Al wants
to see you, Trixie.

09:47.400 --> 09:48.526
All right.

09:48.568 --> 09:50.798
He wants you
over there now.

09:50.837 --> 09:52.702
I'll be there when
I get there, E.B.

09:52.739 --> 09:55.333
How is Mrs. Garret
anyway?

09:55.375 --> 09:57.343
Hunky-dory.

10:16.963 --> 10:19.932
My boss wants me.

10:19.966 --> 10:21.957
I'll be back
quick as I can.

10:25.939 --> 10:27.463
This passes.

10:27.507 --> 10:29.304
All right.

10:34.213 --> 10:36.306
Place your bets,
gentlemen.

10:36.349 --> 10:37.976
Place your bets.

10:38.017 --> 10:40.076
New shooter
coming out!

10:41.421 --> 10:43.412
The winner's seven.

10:48.227 --> 10:50.058
What you hear
on that vaccine?

10:51.664 --> 10:54.394
He's had a case
break out at his place.

10:54.434 --> 10:55.901
Let's go to the cage,

10:55.935 --> 10:58.130
or shall the three of us
leap up on tables

10:58.171 --> 10:59.763
and shout questions
across the room?

10:59.806 --> 11:02.331
What about the vaccine?

11:02.375 --> 11:04.468
The boy never
made Nebraska.

11:04.510 --> 11:06.102
- He took sick.
- Where is he now?

11:06.145 --> 11:08.670
- In the back here.
- How long has that been?

11:08.715 --> 11:10.842
You don't want
to pursue that tone.

11:10.883 --> 11:12.578
You sat on news,

11:12.618 --> 11:15.212
no one went after the meds,
now I'm asking the duration.

11:15.254 --> 11:17.984
And I'm saying questions
in that tone and pointing

11:18.024 --> 11:20.515
your finger at me will get
you told to fuck yourself.

11:20.560 --> 11:23.154
Show me the room
where the boy is.

11:26.065 --> 11:28.795
Please, join us.

11:30.436 --> 11:33.928
How long they been
playing this without me?

11:48.054 --> 11:50.989
- What do you want?
- It's laundry day, madam.

11:51.024 --> 11:54.460
- I've come to replace the linen.
- Leave it and go.

11:59.932 --> 12:01.729
Are you ill?

12:01.768 --> 12:03.429
Leave the room.

12:04.437 --> 12:05.927
Of course.

12:25.224 --> 12:27.419
Breathe.

12:34.367 --> 12:36.335
We should chat
this all out.

12:36.369 --> 12:38.462
Sure.

12:40.673 --> 12:42.538
Why don't we do
something together?

12:42.575 --> 12:44.440
Us and several others?

12:44.477 --> 12:46.468
Yeah, all right.

12:51.517 --> 12:52.814
Lift up.

12:52.852 --> 12:54.615
There we go.

12:57.757 --> 13:00.282
All right, lie down.

13:16.142 --> 13:17.803
If I had
that mug on me,

13:17.844 --> 13:19.744
I believe I'd cut down
getting told

13:19.779 --> 13:21.713
how butt fucking
ugly I was

13:21.747 --> 13:24.147
by not staring at
fucking strangers.

13:27.920 --> 13:31.913
Sorry-looking cabin
even in this shithole camp!

13:31.958 --> 13:35.587
Passers-through has
a right to make inquiries?

13:35.628 --> 13:38.756
A leave-taker has it.

13:46.739 --> 13:48.730
I carried that
fucking child!

13:52.011 --> 13:54.639
No, not in my belly, but

13:54.680 --> 13:57.444
none of that
fucking blood in me.

13:57.483 --> 13:59.314
Fucking cocksucker!

14:05.158 --> 14:09.322
It's Jane Canary calling
for Doc fucking Cochran!

14:11.564 --> 14:13.657
You fucking
in there?

14:19.505 --> 14:21.268
I believe
I'll fucking wait!

14:27.246 --> 14:29.043
Trixie's upstairs.

14:29.081 --> 14:31.208
E.B.'s waiting for you
in the kitchen.

14:31.250 --> 14:33.548
Quit drinking a few hours.
We're having a get-together.

14:33.586 --> 14:35.019
Whom do you mean?

14:35.054 --> 14:37.352
Buy some fucking fruit
or the like, huh?

14:41.994 --> 14:44.326
I told you something
strange was going on.

14:44.363 --> 14:47.161
Are you prepared now
to tell me what it is?

14:47.200 --> 14:50.795
If that widow was high
I am a monkey's uncle.

14:53.372 --> 14:55.033
How much fruit?

14:55.074 --> 14:58.441
How many's a fucking
get-together?

14:58.477 --> 15:01.378
Now one thing I can
tell you, Johnny...

15:03.282 --> 15:05.682
right now ain't
a good time to ask.

15:13.459 --> 15:15.950
Hi, Al.

15:15.995 --> 15:17.656
You toss the place?

15:17.697 --> 15:19.688
I know what's
in this room.

15:19.732 --> 15:21.723
How's the widow?

15:21.767 --> 15:24.099
You giving her
that dope?

15:24.136 --> 15:26.297
I give it
to her regular.

15:26.339 --> 15:28.239
And she takes it?

15:28.274 --> 15:31.004
She goes behind where she dresses
to spare the child seeing.

15:31.043 --> 15:33.841
When she goes behind
where she dresses to spare the child,

15:33.879 --> 15:36.074
do you see billows
of dope smoke rising?

15:36.115 --> 15:37.912
She says
she eats it.

15:37.950 --> 15:41.283
- Does she act high to you?
- I can't be sure.

15:41.320 --> 15:43.345
I never seen a rich person
high before.

15:50.162 --> 15:52.357
Next piece of dope,
Trixie...

15:55.201 --> 15:57.635
you go behind the screen
with the widow.

15:57.670 --> 15:59.535
You watch her
put it in her mouth,

15:59.572 --> 16:00.869
you watch her swallow.

16:00.906 --> 16:02.806
Afterwards, you look
down her fucking yap

16:02.842 --> 16:04.400
and you verify
she's got nothing

16:04.443 --> 16:06.536
above or below
her fucking tongue.

16:06.579 --> 16:08.638
I'll find
a good reason.

16:08.681 --> 16:10.546
You being fucking
clever with me?

16:10.583 --> 16:12.050
How am I supposed
to do that

16:12.084 --> 16:13.517
and not arouse
her suspicion?

16:13.552 --> 16:16.248
Only suspicion you
gotta worry about is mine

16:16.289 --> 16:19.315
of if you're giving it
to her at all.

16:20.660 --> 16:22.389
Why wouldn't I?

16:22.428 --> 16:26.194
I'd rather try touching the moon
than take on a whore's thinking.

16:27.833 --> 16:30.461
Only know this, Trixie,

16:30.503 --> 16:32.130
that widow better
be muddleheaded

16:32.171 --> 16:34.002
next time Farnum
sees her or you pay.

16:34.040 --> 16:36.600
- Can I go back?
- Please.

17:03.336 --> 17:05.236
Trixie and me chatted
on the subject

17:05.271 --> 17:07.364
- of the widow taking dope.
- I see.

17:07.406 --> 17:10.704
- Trixie's gonna make sure she does.
- Good.

17:10.742 --> 17:13.337
You find pretext
to determine Trixie ain't Iying.

17:13.378 --> 17:15.711
Oh.

17:23.622 --> 17:25.749
DamseI in distress.

17:28.426 --> 17:31.988
Will you want me back
for the get-together?

17:32.031 --> 17:34.659
How the fuck could we
do it without you, E.B.?

17:34.700 --> 17:36.531
Truth isn't
in you.

17:36.569 --> 17:38.560
Makes two of us.

17:44.610 --> 17:46.578
Dolly was with
that drummer.

17:46.612 --> 17:48.443
'Fraid he give
her plague.

17:51.450 --> 17:53.941
Fucking plague!

17:56.455 --> 18:00.118
& Row, row, row
your boat &

18:00.159 --> 18:02.923
& Gently down the steam &

18:02.962 --> 18:05.760
& Merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily &

18:05.798 --> 18:08.528
& Life is but a dream &

18:08.567 --> 18:12.025
& Merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily &

18:12.071 --> 18:16.201
& Life is but a dream. &

18:16.242 --> 18:17.834
It's lovely.

18:17.877 --> 18:19.868
Very lovely.

18:19.912 --> 18:22.642
I need you to do
something for me.

18:22.681 --> 18:24.205
And I know you can.

18:24.250 --> 18:27.378
When Farnum's here,
so we can buy you time to get well

18:27.420 --> 18:29.354
you have to fake
being high.

18:29.388 --> 18:32.323
& Row, row,
row your boat &

18:32.358 --> 18:36.419
- & Gently down the steam... &
- You can do it, Alma.

18:36.462 --> 18:38.396
Look at all
the practice you've had.

18:38.431 --> 18:41.127
& Merrily, merrily, merrily,
life is but a dream &

18:46.672 --> 18:49.800
You better have a paying
dwarf underneath you!

18:49.842 --> 18:52.436
Am I dying?

18:52.478 --> 18:57.506
Turn off the fucking water
and tell me what you did.

18:57.550 --> 19:00.917
- I know you didn't fuck him.
- No.

19:00.953 --> 19:02.477
You suck his prick?

19:02.521 --> 19:05.251
He didn't want to show it to me
till he had a hard on.

19:05.291 --> 19:07.759
That's what you call
a mistake of youth.

19:10.129 --> 19:11.790
You mug it up
with him?

19:11.831 --> 19:14.629
- A little.
- French lock or normal?

19:14.667 --> 19:16.396
Normal.

19:17.837 --> 19:20.067
So any hoople-head
who drank

19:20.105 --> 19:21.663
from the same glass
this guy did

19:21.707 --> 19:24.267
would have as much right
to sit there weeping as you,

19:24.310 --> 19:26.870
except I can't kick his ass
and send him out to work.

19:26.912 --> 19:30.643
My mom died of it
when we was coming out.

19:30.683 --> 19:33.117
And that's when
Daddy gave us up.

19:35.154 --> 19:37.315
Well, that sad story
makes me believe

19:37.356 --> 19:40.985
maybe you was exposed
and ain't a candidate for it no more.

19:47.399 --> 19:50.197
Stick to hand jobs
a day or two if you like.

19:56.675 --> 19:58.472
These sheets
need cleaning.

19:58.511 --> 20:00.570
I just provided
new linens.

20:00.613 --> 20:02.103
And now they got
sick on 'em.

20:02.147 --> 20:04.342
Take those
to the Chinaman.

20:04.383 --> 20:05.941
Show you want
a clean exchange.

20:05.985 --> 20:08.044
Say, "For Mr. Farnum, Wu.

20:08.087 --> 20:10.419
Sheet for Farnum. "

20:23.702 --> 20:26.102
- Hello.
- Hello, Mr. Star.

20:26.138 --> 20:28.106
- May I help with those sheets?
- I got 'em.

20:28.140 --> 20:30.108
How is Mrs. Garret?

20:30.142 --> 20:33.009
- Still not receiving.
- You do tell her I've asked to call?

20:33.045 --> 20:35.104
On commission
for Mr. Bullock.

20:35.147 --> 20:37.581
How's business
at your store?

20:37.616 --> 20:39.709
Brisk.

20:39.752 --> 20:41.185
Oh.

21:00.406 --> 21:02.340
Jesus Christ!

21:02.374 --> 21:04.467
You just shit
yourself!

21:04.510 --> 21:08.537
I take it you've been
out on a hoot.

21:08.581 --> 21:10.515
I've been drunk
awhile, correct.

21:10.549 --> 21:12.016
What the fuck
is that to you?

21:12.051 --> 21:15.851
Question was well meant,
like if you was

21:15.888 --> 21:19.153
a farmer I would ask you
how the farming was going.

21:19.191 --> 21:22.285
I did lose my fucking
best friend, you know?

21:22.328 --> 21:24.091
I know.

21:24.129 --> 21:27.895
Anyways, I ain't here
to teach you any manners.

21:30.269 --> 21:33.363
I was wondering
about the child.

21:33.405 --> 21:35.771
She's fine.

21:36.775 --> 21:38.766
And what else?

21:38.811 --> 21:41.780
And she's staying
with that widow,

21:41.814 --> 21:45.045
and the whore from The Gem
is with her, too.

21:45.084 --> 21:47.746
What the fuck is a whore
doing with her?

21:47.786 --> 21:50.448
The widow has health
problems of her own.

21:50.489 --> 21:52.787
And Trixie's
taking care of her.

21:52.825 --> 21:54.656
Trixie being
the fucking whore?

21:54.693 --> 21:57.924
You have high standards
as applied to other people.

21:57.963 --> 22:01.455
I ain't judging anyone.
I was seeking information!

22:01.500 --> 22:04.264
Well, are you
adequately informed?

22:04.303 --> 22:06.999
Yes, I am,
you cocksucker!

22:07.039 --> 22:09.473
'Cause I am
in the midst of a situation.

22:09.508 --> 22:11.339
Oh, smallpox?

22:18.484 --> 22:21.180
What the fuck
is that to you?

22:21.220 --> 22:25.054
Fella in the woods I see
to say hello to has it.

22:25.090 --> 22:27.115
Unless he caught it
from a trout.

22:27.159 --> 22:30.686
I figured some in the camp
could be down with it, too.

22:30.729 --> 22:32.629
What was he doing
in the woods?

22:32.665 --> 22:33.962
Someone threw him there.

22:33.999 --> 22:35.967
Anyways, he's better now.

22:36.001 --> 22:37.593
And how do
you feeI?

22:37.636 --> 22:39.729
What's that
supposed to mean?

22:39.772 --> 22:42.366
- How do you feeI?
- Why?

22:42.408 --> 22:45.070
I take it that you're
feeling well.

22:45.110 --> 22:47.135
- Am I wrong?
- No, you're not fucking wrong!

22:47.179 --> 22:49.170
That's all I wanted
to fucking know!

22:49.214 --> 22:51.876
I will lay you out
as soon as look at you!

22:51.917 --> 22:54.112
This is my point.

22:54.153 --> 22:56.553
You been caring
for a sick man

22:56.588 --> 22:58.920
who doesn't seem
to have gotten you sick.

22:58.957 --> 23:01.323
Aren't you a wise
fucking owI?

23:01.360 --> 23:05.126
Being as you have
a gift for it,

23:05.164 --> 23:09.100
and I'm gonna have
sick people up to my hips,

23:09.134 --> 23:12.968
I was wondering if you might
wanna come back to camp.

23:14.173 --> 23:16.641
My best friend died.

23:20.312 --> 23:22.712
And he ain't
coming back!

23:27.119 --> 23:29.849
Now will you
help me?

23:29.888 --> 23:34.188
You can do your drinking
off work, like I do.

23:57.850 --> 23:59.841
Madam?

24:04.356 --> 24:06.017
Yes?

24:10.429 --> 24:12.090
How are you?

24:12.131 --> 24:15.567
Better, Mr. Farnum.
Thank you.

24:17.169 --> 24:19.364
I'm glad.

24:19.404 --> 24:21.838
How are you?

24:21.874 --> 24:24.138
Very well,
thank you.

24:25.711 --> 24:27.611
Excuse me.

24:27.646 --> 24:29.807
- I brought more linens.
- Hmm.

24:29.848 --> 24:32.316
I'd heard
someone threw up.

24:52.704 --> 24:55.730
Well, appears
luck pinches out

24:55.774 --> 24:58.004
at this game even
quicker than prospecting.

24:58.043 --> 24:59.704
It can come back
that quick, too.

24:59.745 --> 25:03.078
Never weaken,
same as at the creek.

25:03.115 --> 25:06.846
You want to stop for a while, Ellsworth?
We can stop.

25:06.885 --> 25:08.580
Oh, what if
my luck comes back?

25:08.620 --> 25:10.918
Won't be here
to reap the benefits.

25:10.956 --> 25:13.151
Well, maybe it'll
a wait for ya.

25:13.192 --> 25:14.216
Of course, too,

25:14.259 --> 25:16.659
maybe it won't,
right, Joanie?

25:19.231 --> 25:21.165
Maybe you should stop
for awhile, honey.

25:21.200 --> 25:22.895
You need to piss?

25:22.935 --> 25:25.028
Excuse me.

25:25.070 --> 25:27.538
Did I say that
too polite, Cy?

25:27.573 --> 25:29.939
Go head off now.

25:31.376 --> 25:34.140
Eddie, take over
the game.

25:34.179 --> 25:36.704
Push them bones
my way, will ya?

25:36.748 --> 25:39.512
Place your bets, gentlemen.
Place your bets.

25:39.551 --> 25:42.748
All right, let's warm
the world back up now.

25:42.788 --> 25:44.688
New shooter coming out.

25:46.091 --> 25:48.924
Seven, the winner.
The winner is seven.

25:48.961 --> 25:51.589
You sure you don't want
to get on me, young man?

25:51.630 --> 25:54.428
Well, I might
hazard a 20.

25:54.466 --> 25:56.058
All right, now!

25:58.103 --> 25:59.832
Do not detain me.

26:01.306 --> 26:03.831
Seven, the winner
is seven.

26:03.876 --> 26:05.776
Hot shooter!

26:05.811 --> 26:07.836
You can't keep
an old man down!

26:07.880 --> 26:10.940
Wagons,
westward bound!

26:10.983 --> 26:13.781
- It's a seven.
- You better get on me now.

26:13.819 --> 26:17.152
I got a meeting to go to
and I got a hot hand here!

26:17.189 --> 26:18.656
Hah!

26:18.690 --> 26:21.420
Money's out front,
honey.

26:21.460 --> 26:23.121
Okay.

26:25.764 --> 26:28.460
Spots are coming out
all over his body.

26:28.500 --> 26:30.695
That don't decide
how it ends.

26:30.736 --> 26:32.931
Joey was cherry.

26:32.971 --> 26:34.563
I know.

26:34.606 --> 26:36.938
He didn't want us
to do it till he knew how.

26:36.975 --> 26:39.705
You'd do better
if the tricks

26:39.745 --> 26:41.940
didn't think looking
at 'em made you cry.

26:52.357 --> 26:54.018
Whoa, now.

28:02.995 --> 28:04.895
It's Johnny Burns,
Reverend.

28:11.003 --> 28:12.903
Mr. Burns.

28:12.938 --> 28:16.066
- How are you?
- There's a meeting at The Gem.

28:16.108 --> 28:18.235
Mr. Swearengen thought
you'd wanna come, too.

28:18.276 --> 28:20.073
At his saloon?

28:20.112 --> 28:21.545
Yes, sir.

28:22.748 --> 28:25.410
May I ask
the meeting's purpose?

28:25.450 --> 28:27.941
Well, he don't get
into that with me.

28:27.986 --> 28:29.886
All right, thank you.

28:29.921 --> 28:32.389
Tell Mr. Swearengen
I will be there.

28:32.424 --> 28:34.790
He's having me
get fruit.

28:34.826 --> 28:37.226
I know that much.

28:37.262 --> 28:39.287
Fine.

28:44.603 --> 28:48.369
The three red hands
on the pony's flank

28:48.407 --> 28:50.602
was three men killed
hand to hand.

28:50.642 --> 28:54.510
The red circle was
one killed on horseback.

28:54.546 --> 28:57.447
The white lines
on the pony's legs

28:57.482 --> 28:59.575
was times that he's
a'counted coup.

28:59.618 --> 29:02.610
With them, whether
you mean to kill your man

29:02.654 --> 29:04.451
after or you're just
showing off,

29:04.489 --> 29:08.016
you hit 'em with a gun butt
or a stick or a club.

29:08.060 --> 29:10.290
That's counting coup.

29:10.328 --> 29:12.228
That's why he come
for you instead of

29:12.264 --> 29:14.562
picking you off with an arrow,
like he did your horse.

29:14.599 --> 29:16.624
Charlie.

29:16.668 --> 29:18.898
Ah, there you are.

29:21.773 --> 29:25.368
That was one bad hombre
you got by Bullock.

29:25.410 --> 29:27.810
Bill's dead,
Charlie.

29:32.484 --> 29:34.475
Of your own seeing?

29:35.921 --> 29:37.912
Yeah.

29:39.191 --> 29:41.489
I heard it spoke of
two days ago,

29:41.526 --> 29:45.428
but as often
as he wasn't before,

29:45.464 --> 29:47.694
I hoped he wasn't
this time, too.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.696
I was after
the bastard who did it.

29:54.739 --> 29:56.400
Anything broke?

29:56.441 --> 29:58.432
No.

29:58.477 --> 30:01.241
Can you ride?

30:02.614 --> 30:04.605
Yeah.

30:04.649 --> 30:06.810
Let's get
that cocksucker.

30:09.154 --> 30:11.179
We should
dig a grave.

30:11.223 --> 30:14.659
I'd as soon not waste
the fucking time.

30:15.727 --> 30:17.786
It won't take long.

30:20.232 --> 30:22.462
You ain't doing
him no favor.

30:22.501 --> 30:26.198
I mean his way to heaven's
above ground and looking west!

30:26.238 --> 30:29.036
Well, let's
do that, then.

30:33.245 --> 30:34.974
Don't you want to take
him over the ridge?

30:35.013 --> 30:37.675
This hole in the ground and put him
up there with his headless buddy?

30:37.716 --> 30:40.583
I mean, that's what you
nearly got killed for.

30:40.619 --> 30:43.087
Interfering with his
big fucking medicine,

30:43.121 --> 30:47.683
burying his fucking buddy
over the fucking ridge!

31:05.744 --> 31:08.372
Trixie did her work
and then some, Al.

31:08.413 --> 31:11.007
Must've put a double
handfuI of that dope

31:11.049 --> 31:12.175
down the widow's mouth.

31:12.217 --> 31:14.947
Did you happen to offer
on her gold claim?

31:14.986 --> 31:16.385
The moment was wrong.

31:16.421 --> 31:18.150
The dope had made
the widow randy.

31:19.658 --> 31:21.956
LustfuI looks,
heavy breathing.

31:21.993 --> 31:23.392
Outthrust chest.

31:23.428 --> 31:25.328
The full catalog.

31:25.363 --> 31:27.854
Only hope you comported
yourself as a gentlemen.

31:27.899 --> 31:29.764
There was a child
in the room.

31:29.801 --> 31:33.328
Peaches and pears
on the fucking bar.

31:33.371 --> 31:35.737
Spoon it out amongst
yourselves.

31:46.318 --> 31:48.411
First thing to say is...

31:50.055 --> 31:52.751
plague's in
the fucking camp.

31:52.791 --> 31:55.123
Smallpox.

31:55.160 --> 31:57.492
Plague is spread
by rats.

31:57.529 --> 31:59.429
I was raised
calling it plague

31:59.464 --> 32:01.329
but Doc wants
that in reserve

32:01.366 --> 32:03.766
in case our luck holds
and the rats decide

32:03.802 --> 32:05.531
to descend on us,
too, hmm?

32:05.570 --> 32:08.698
But whatever you
fucking call it,

32:08.740 --> 32:10.935
the point is for
no one to raise

32:10.976 --> 32:13.308
their fucking dresses
over their heads.

32:13.345 --> 32:16.280
You- you wait
it out.

32:16.314 --> 32:18.248
You outlast
the cocksucker.

32:18.283 --> 32:20.717
I've outlasted several
fucking outbreaks.

32:20.752 --> 32:22.845
Is it pretty?
No, but it passes.

32:24.990 --> 32:26.787
So, we need a place
for them to get it.

32:26.825 --> 32:30.022
To care for 'em
and to keep 'em outta sight

32:30.061 --> 32:31.824
so people don't get
frightened and disgusted.

32:31.863 --> 32:33.524
Mr. Bullock and me
have lumber left

32:33.565 --> 32:35.465
from putting
our building up.

32:35.500 --> 32:36.967
Tent's a better
impression.

32:37.002 --> 32:40.165
Emphasizes it's
a passing phase.

32:40.205 --> 32:42.298
As far as a vaccine,

32:42.340 --> 32:45.503
one place we know has it
is Fort Carney.

32:45.543 --> 32:46.840
How do we know that?

32:46.878 --> 32:48.243
Off the fucking issue,
Tom.

32:48.280 --> 32:49.747
Bismarck

32:49.781 --> 32:52.716
and Cheyenne
probably got it, too.

32:52.751 --> 32:56.380
So we should send to all three places.
And as time's a factor,

32:56.421 --> 32:58.389
stagecoaches ain't
the right conveyance,

32:58.423 --> 33:01.017
so I suggest three groups
of horsemen, huh?

33:01.059 --> 33:03.584
Five riders to a group,
fend off the dirt worshipers.

33:03.628 --> 33:06.563
60 bucks a rider,
$10 in advance, 50 on return.

33:06.598 --> 33:09.692
Would be three times
five times 60.

33:09.734 --> 33:11.395
$900 at the worst.

33:11.436 --> 33:13.597
Assuming they
all survive.

33:13.638 --> 33:16.266
Add in, for the vaccine
and paying the Doc,

33:16.308 --> 33:18.776
I would say $1,500
is the target.

33:18.810 --> 33:21.506
I'm in for five.

33:21.546 --> 33:24.947
- 500.
- Two.

33:24.983 --> 33:27.213
- Two.
- You fucking kidding me, E.B.?

33:27.252 --> 33:28.776
150.

33:28.820 --> 33:30.754
50 from
Bullock and Star.

33:30.789 --> 33:32.313
You're all right.

33:33.725 --> 33:36.057
150 hits the target.

33:36.094 --> 33:39.029
I assume they'll be
a public announcement in "The Pioneer. "

33:39.064 --> 33:42.363
Yeah, get a jump on
them panic-mongers.

33:42.400 --> 33:45.369
Can you give me
five minutes, Doc,

33:45.403 --> 33:47.234
after the meeting
adjourns?

33:47.272 --> 33:50.070
Give some positive angle to it.
Vaccine's on it's way

33:50.108 --> 33:52.599
or looks like it's
the mild type.

33:52.644 --> 33:56.478
It would also be usefuI
to avoid apocalyptic predictions.

33:56.514 --> 33:59.142
Nip that Sodom and Gomorrah shit
in the bud, huh?

33:59.184 --> 34:01.311
And stigmatizing
the afflicted.

34:01.353 --> 34:05.187
Where will we locate
the pest tent?

34:09.194 --> 34:12.094
I bought a lot at the end
of Chink's Alley you can use.

34:12.130 --> 34:14.724
Gonna build a joint
in future, catering

34:14.766 --> 34:17.563
to the celestials, ain't you?
You clever cocksucker.

34:17.601 --> 34:21.094
They are the fucking degenerate
gamblers among all the races.

34:21.139 --> 34:23.333
I'll see to recruiting
the riders.

34:23.375 --> 34:25.842
$10 a rider advanced money.

34:25.877 --> 34:28.277
If I can get
your John Hancock

34:28.313 --> 34:30.713
for the receipt
of the 150...

34:33.618 --> 34:36.815
Fruit's up here,
anybody didn't get any.

34:40.358 --> 34:42.656
Oh, for Chrissake.

34:45.897 --> 34:47.489
All right, Reverend.

34:47.532 --> 34:50.126
Somebody get me something
to hold his jaw open.

34:50.168 --> 34:53.103
Here you go, Doc.
Fruit spoon, Doc.

34:53.138 --> 34:54.935
Not a fucking
metal spoon, Johnny!

34:54.973 --> 34:57.065
He'll break every
tooth in his mouth.

34:57.108 --> 34:59.076
Here you go, Doc.

35:03.248 --> 35:06.411
Doc, I won't say
it's pristine.

35:06.451 --> 35:08.942
All right, Reverend.

35:10.355 --> 35:12.448
You're doing better,
Reverend.

35:17.095 --> 35:19.120
You ever see him
do that?

35:21.032 --> 35:23.023
He's all right.

35:25.870 --> 35:27.838
Used to have a fucking
brother given to that.

35:27.872 --> 35:30.204
We'd make
pennies off it

35:30.241 --> 35:32.004
when it'd come
over him in the street.

35:32.043 --> 35:33.840
Hey, Reverend,

35:33.878 --> 35:37.871
you could've
just said "Amen. "

35:52.430 --> 35:54.898
Quite the civic figure,
Cy.

35:54.933 --> 35:58.699
That's me, that's
what I live for.

35:58.736 --> 36:00.670
How healthy we leave
that prospector?

36:00.705 --> 36:02.002
He'll be back.

36:02.040 --> 36:04.065
Fucking Joanie.

36:04.108 --> 36:06.906
Got a crack
out of turn.

36:06.945 --> 36:09.880
You still got an awfuI
smooth hand, young man.

36:09.914 --> 36:11.074
Yeah.

36:11.115 --> 36:13.208
Practice makes
perfect, huh?

36:13.251 --> 36:17.017
Yeah, Cy. And you give a good
hand job yourself.

36:20.725 --> 36:24.627
Find out from Joanie how exposed
that redhead got to the kid.

36:24.662 --> 36:27.688
Anything else you want me
to ask you her for you?

36:27.732 --> 36:29.290
Eddie, if I talk
to her right now,

36:29.334 --> 36:30.926
I'll break her
fucking jaw.

36:30.969 --> 36:34.871
And if we keep talking,
I'll break yours, too.

36:49.287 --> 36:53.747
I take it I suffered some sort
of convulsion or seizure.

36:53.791 --> 36:56.658
Perhaps brought on
by irregular hours.

36:56.694 --> 36:59.094
Oh, I see. I suspect you will
soon be hanging up

36:59.130 --> 37:01.428
your shingle in
competition with me?

37:01.466 --> 37:04.993
- No, oh no, no, sir.
- Mm.

37:05.036 --> 37:09.063
How did you feeI before
the spell come on you?

37:09.107 --> 37:12.201
I noticed a peculiar
smell in the air,

37:12.243 --> 37:14.643
as if something
were burning.

37:14.679 --> 37:16.943
Is this first time?

37:16.981 --> 37:19.643
No, the first episode
occurred several days ago.

37:19.684 --> 37:21.948
After the service
for Mr. Hickok.

37:21.986 --> 37:24.978
And any others between
that one and this?

37:25.023 --> 37:27.218
No.

37:27.258 --> 37:29.317
Follow my finger.

37:35.066 --> 37:38.593
Hmm, perhaps
I just need glasses.

37:38.636 --> 37:41.696
Merrick needs to see
you about the article.

37:41.739 --> 37:44.765
Prescribe this malingerer
a can of peaches

37:44.809 --> 37:46.970
and show him
the fucking door.

37:51.349 --> 37:55.683
Am I clear to assist you
to tend to the sick?

37:55.720 --> 37:58.712
You are cleared,
Reverend.

38:06.998 --> 38:09.558
What the fuck's
wrong with you?

38:09.601 --> 38:12.001
I don't know.

38:12.036 --> 38:14.402
You better figure it
the fuck out.

38:14.439 --> 38:17.670
'Cause this free-ride
shit's coming to a quick fucking halt.

38:19.510 --> 38:21.205
Free ride?

38:21.245 --> 38:23.213
What would
you call it?

38:23.247 --> 38:26.045
I earn my way.

38:26.084 --> 38:28.575
How?

38:28.620 --> 38:31.680
Posing in expensive dresses
and breaking up catfights?

38:31.723 --> 38:34.817
Taking trouble
to steer the trade?

38:34.859 --> 38:36.520
That don't pay
the freight, honey.

38:36.561 --> 38:39.792
You're here to create
a fucking atmosphere.

38:39.831 --> 38:43.062
Fucking atmosphere you
create lately, "I'm sad. "

38:43.101 --> 38:46.901
Then on your bad days,
"Oh, I'm so sad. "

38:48.673 --> 38:50.334
Oh.

38:54.145 --> 38:56.079
What is it,
sweetheart?

38:57.782 --> 38:59.841
I guess
it's coming here.

38:59.884 --> 39:02.944
What's wrong
with coming here?

39:02.987 --> 39:04.784
You never liked
the river that much.

39:04.822 --> 39:07.256
What's wrong with
a fresh start?

39:07.291 --> 39:09.816
How it feels when
there isn't one.

39:09.861 --> 39:11.886
Well, shit.

39:11.929 --> 39:14.796
Stay here, I'll bring
you back a fucking lollipop.

39:17.502 --> 39:21.131
Sorry I cracked
on your play with the prospector.

39:21.172 --> 39:24.630
Me and Eddie turned it
into a longer campaign.

39:24.676 --> 39:27.440
If he don't get plague,
it'll all have a happy end.

39:28.780 --> 39:31.305
My worry's you.

39:31.349 --> 39:33.909
And my concern's

39:33.951 --> 39:37.011
feelings of fucking
affection.

39:38.589 --> 39:40.580
Shut up, Cy.

39:40.625 --> 39:42.957
Work on believing it,
Joanie.

39:48.166 --> 39:52.068
That's the way I always want
to touch you, just like that.

39:54.806 --> 39:57.570
Don't make me
do it different.

40:10.455 --> 40:13.185
"Two cases of the smallpox

40:13.224 --> 40:16.489
have been diagnosed in our camp
by Doctor Amos Cochran. "

40:16.527 --> 40:18.552
Hey, Doc!

40:25.103 --> 40:27.037
Get the Amos
outta there!

40:27.071 --> 40:28.698
Scratch Amos.

40:28.740 --> 40:32.039
"At Dr. Cochran's suggestion,
a pest tent,

40:32.076 --> 40:36.945
endowed by the generous
retailers of our fine community,

40:36.981 --> 40:40.075
is being erected
for the afflicted on the south end,

40:40.118 --> 40:43.383
and riders dispatched
to secure a vaccine. "

40:43.421 --> 40:45.082
Maybe you
should add there,

40:45.123 --> 40:47.785
"They're already probably
on their way back. "

40:49.193 --> 40:51.320
Excuse me.

40:51.362 --> 40:56.823
"'The Pioneer' has been assured
of their imminent return. "

40:56.868 --> 40:58.563
That's catchier.

40:58.603 --> 41:01.163
"Thanks also to
the aforementioned merchants,

41:01.205 --> 41:03.230
the vaccine will be
distributed gratis. "

41:03.274 --> 41:05.174
Free gratis.

41:05.209 --> 41:08.542
Free gratis
is a redundancy.

41:08.579 --> 41:11.707
Does that mean
repeats itself?

41:11.749 --> 41:14.149
Then leave gratis out.

41:15.219 --> 41:17.210
What luck for me, Al,
that you have

41:17.255 --> 41:19.450
such a keen
editorial sense.

41:19.490 --> 41:22.323
Free.
Distributed free.

41:22.360 --> 41:23.884
Period.

41:25.530 --> 41:28.897
It will take me some
time to reset the type.

41:28.933 --> 41:30.491
Yeah, hurry up.

41:30.535 --> 41:32.696
Excuse me.

41:32.737 --> 41:34.398
Al.

41:39.243 --> 41:42.838
Thanks for not putting
the stink on me before with the others

41:42.880 --> 41:45.314
over that Fort Carney
business.

41:45.349 --> 41:47.180
Sure.

41:50.721 --> 41:52.279
I'm back.

41:52.323 --> 41:54.416
Your room has
been re-rented!

41:54.458 --> 41:56.790
Fuck you and fuck
the rooms you rent.

41:56.828 --> 41:59.422
I'm calling on the widow and the little
one in her care.

41:59.463 --> 42:02.523
And if I was you,
or any cocksucker with you,

42:02.567 --> 42:03.898
I wouldn't
try to stop me.

42:03.935 --> 42:06.403
- Be brief.
- Be fucked!

42:08.539 --> 42:10.370
Her gutter mouth

42:10.408 --> 42:12.399
and the widow in
an opium stupor.

42:12.443 --> 42:16.072
A conversation
for the ages.

42:33.364 --> 42:35.229
Hey, fuck-nut!

42:35.266 --> 42:37.598
What you got
in that suitcase?

42:37.635 --> 42:39.330
Millinery samples.

42:39.370 --> 42:41.565
If it concerns
you at all.

42:41.606 --> 42:44.598
Millinery samples,
ain't that just perfect!

42:44.642 --> 42:47.202
Some women...

42:47.245 --> 42:49.770
take the trouble to make
a decent appearance.

42:49.814 --> 42:52.408
Well, for your
information, Mr. Millinery-

42:52.450 --> 42:54.611
Sample-Suitcase cocksucker,

42:54.652 --> 42:56.711
you're staying in
the former room of someone

42:56.754 --> 42:58.312
you ain't fit
to lick the boots of!

42:58.356 --> 43:00.483
Wild Bill Hickok.

43:00.524 --> 43:02.856
I paid $2
a day extra.

43:05.596 --> 43:07.962
Had you any connection
to Wild Bill?

43:10.534 --> 43:13.662
Good luck with your
fucking day selling hats.

43:17.675 --> 43:19.074
It's Jane!

43:21.646 --> 43:24.479
Oh my God.

43:24.515 --> 43:26.813
Hello, Jane.

43:26.851 --> 43:28.978
Look at you.

43:29.020 --> 43:31.215
Listen to you.
Oh my God in heaven.

43:34.659 --> 43:36.524
I'm Trixie.

43:36.560 --> 43:38.790
I think I've seen you.

43:38.829 --> 43:40.592
At The Gem.

43:40.631 --> 43:42.622
Yeah.

43:42.667 --> 43:44.532
Maybe that's where.

43:51.008 --> 43:52.999
You look like shit.

43:54.912 --> 43:56.846
Oh, owe you a penny.

43:56.881 --> 43:59.008
I'm better.

43:59.050 --> 44:02.986
I was so sorry to hear
about Mr. Hickok.

44:03.020 --> 44:04.954
Yeah.

44:07.325 --> 44:10.726
You oughtta get
your husband outta that creek.

44:10.761 --> 44:14.822
As soon as I feeI
just a little better.

44:15.967 --> 44:20.734
Anyways, I'm glad
to see this little one

44:20.771 --> 44:24.468
in good condition
and talking, to boot.

44:24.508 --> 44:26.533
Come see her
all the time.

44:26.577 --> 44:29.876
Nah, I'm
fucking drunk.

44:33.551 --> 44:36.111
I might be seeing
to sick people.

44:36.153 --> 44:38.621
But I'm gonna keep

44:38.656 --> 44:42.683
this exact recollection
of your lovely mug.

44:42.727 --> 44:46.288
And put a penny aside
every time I curse.

44:46.330 --> 44:49.060
And that is
my promise to you,

44:49.100 --> 44:52.069
and me too. We'll see each other
again down the road.

45:07.018 --> 45:09.543
- Gentlemen-
- Well, let's see it.

45:09.587 --> 45:12.488
Or should I say,
my fellow authors?

45:13.991 --> 45:15.549
I'm done in there!

45:15.593 --> 45:17.493
Where would the Doc
have got to?

45:17.528 --> 45:19.553
South end
of Chinaman's Alley.

45:27.638 --> 45:29.606
They'll get me there.

45:31.742 --> 45:34.302
I think maybe it should
have a question mark.

45:34.345 --> 45:36.813
"The Plague
in Deadwood?"

45:36.847 --> 45:38.178
The type is set.

45:38.215 --> 45:40.149
You're reading
the definitive edition.

45:42.820 --> 45:44.481
Let's run it.

45:47.725 --> 45:49.716
Nice working with you.

46:03.741 --> 46:06.642
Take him
right over here.

46:13.651 --> 46:15.278
It's all right
to breathe,

46:15.319 --> 46:17.287
just turn your head
away from him.

46:17.321 --> 46:19.949
Okay, Doc.

46:19.990 --> 46:21.617
All right.

46:21.659 --> 46:23.456
Roll him over
on his side.

46:25.529 --> 46:28.293
Turn him back this way.
That's it.

46:30.568 --> 46:32.729
All right,
thank you, fellas.

46:32.770 --> 46:34.635
Bye, Doc.

46:37.808 --> 46:39.833
It's all right, son.

46:39.877 --> 46:41.469
It's going
to be all right.

46:44.348 --> 46:47.010
Hey!

46:47.051 --> 46:49.485
Hey, somebody!

46:53.657 --> 46:56.683
Are you sure
you're up to this?

46:58.129 --> 47:00.154
Oh yes.

47:00.197 --> 47:02.392
I'm right where
I'm supposed to be.

47:16.180 --> 47:18.273
Here's another one
for you.

47:18.315 --> 47:19.907
So I see.

47:21.218 --> 47:24.278
You already been exposed,
you wanna follow him in?

47:24.321 --> 47:26.312
I might.

48:55.312 --> 48:59.772
"'The Pioneer' was assured
of their imminent return. "

49:01.819 --> 49:03.787
I'll believe it
when I see it.

49:05.256 --> 49:08.157
"Imminent return" is one
of my contributions

49:08.192 --> 49:11.025
to the fucking article.
The idea for that phrase.

49:14.932 --> 49:17.366
"Pest tent being
erected at the south-"

49:17.401 --> 49:19.767
What about that
fucking Tolliver

49:19.803 --> 49:22.067
buying up property
on the Q.T., huh?

49:22.106 --> 49:24.131
We're lucky he was
struggling with the shit

49:24.174 --> 49:26.870
when he made the offer
to loan out the lot.

49:26.910 --> 49:29.902
Nonetheless, it says the man
sees the possibilities of the things.

49:29.947 --> 49:31.812
I mean, to come up
at this fucking juncture

49:31.849 --> 49:35.114
with the idea of creating an emporium
for the fucking Chinks

49:35.152 --> 49:36.449
takes brass fucking balls,

49:36.487 --> 49:38.455
and a long-term vision
for the future.

49:41.292 --> 49:43.658
Merrick.

49:43.694 --> 49:46.458
Merrick wanted
to put here "gratis. "

49:46.497 --> 49:48.260
Now is the idea

49:48.299 --> 49:51.860
to inform your reader
or make him feeI like a fucking dunce?

49:51.902 --> 49:53.563
I had him put "free. "

49:53.604 --> 49:56.903
Don't see why he doesn't
have news of the baseball.

49:56.940 --> 49:59.431
That new league started
a team in Chicago.

50:01.078 --> 50:03.774
Different path taken

50:03.814 --> 50:05.873
at certain forks
in the road,

50:05.916 --> 50:08.316
who knows what kind
of a joint we'd be in now?

50:08.352 --> 50:11.788
Of course, truth is,
as a base of operations,

50:11.822 --> 50:15.280
you cannot beat
a fucking saloon.

50:17.661 --> 50:19.822
Ah!

50:30.140 --> 50:33.507
& I'm taken down
with the fever &

50:33.544 --> 50:36.138
& And it won't
let me sleep &

50:38.482 --> 50:41.610
& I'm taken down
with the fever &

50:41.652 --> 50:44.553
& And it won't
let me sleep &

50:46.123 --> 50:49.092
& It was about 3:00 &

50:49.126 --> 50:52.186
& Before he would
let me be &

50:54.298 --> 50:57.392
& I wish somebody &

50:57.434 --> 51:00.562
& Would come and drive
my fever away &

51:02.439 --> 51:05.533
& I wish somebody &

51:05.576 --> 51:08.238
& Come drive
my fever away &

51:09.680 --> 51:13.446
& This fever I'm havin' &

51:13.484 --> 51:16.612
& Sho' is in my way. &
