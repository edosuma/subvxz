Although ski areas expectthe storm to hit tonight,

01:05.774 --> 01:08.109
Spoonerville's getting
the brunt of it now,

01:08.193 --> 01:11.112
where the snow has put a big
dent in local business.

01:11.196 --> 01:15.158
Oh, not the messopany deluxe!

01:15.241 --> 01:17.660
I just had that baby repossessed.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.913
In fact, the city council and--

01:21.373 --> 01:23.208
What a month I'm having,

01:23.291 --> 01:25.669
even worse than I thought!

01:27.796 --> 01:29.839
Well, we cleaned off the cars, Mr. P.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.508
Even did the RVs.

01:31.591 --> 01:34.010
Yeah, Pop. Now can we get paid?

01:34.094 --> 01:36.805
Fellas, times are tough,

01:36.888 --> 01:39.641
and we all gotta make sacrifices.

01:39.724 --> 01:41.351
Save more, spend less,

01:41.434 --> 01:43.103
and tighten the old belt.

[coughs]

01:48.566 --> 01:50.694
Well, you get the picture.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.904
Yeah. You're stiffin' us.

01:52.987 --> 01:55.699
Not at all.
No, but instead of money,

01:55.782 --> 01:57.867
I'm payin' you in...

01:57.951 --> 01:58.910
Paper clips!

01:59.536 --> 02:01.204
Oh, come on, Max.

02:01.287 --> 02:02.831
Let's see what's on the tube.

02:05.041 --> 02:08.503
[man on TV]
Here's the guy who claims he saw Bigfoot.

02:08.586 --> 02:12.090
He was big and hairy
and had these weird ears.

02:12.173 --> 02:13.508
I never seen anything like it.

02:13.591 --> 02:14.551
Here. I drew a picture of him.

02:15.885 --> 02:18.013
Ha! What a rube.

02:18.096 --> 02:22.308
I bet he thinks his sister
got kidnapped by UFOs too.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.519
[man on TV]
Does he or she exist or not?

02:24.602 --> 02:26.563
Is he or she fact?

02:26.646 --> 02:28.231
Is he or she fiction, real or imagined?

02:28.314 --> 02:29.899
Half-human or merely

02:29.983 --> 02:31.484
half-witted and hairy?

02:31.568 --> 02:33.069
No one knows for sure.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.530
If they do know, they're not saying.

02:35.697 --> 02:38.408
Hey, Peej, I'm Bigfoot.

02:38.491 --> 02:40.869
Betcha can't catch me.

02:40.952 --> 02:41.911
[growls]

02:41.995 --> 02:43.663
Ha! Betcha I can!

02:43.747 --> 02:46.207
[roars]

02:46.291 --> 02:50.295
Let's see how fast those
big feet really are, man.

02:50.378 --> 02:53.214
[man on TV]
Still, the hopeful lock to the mountains,

02:53.298 --> 02:56.509
knowing an authentic picture of Bigfoot

02:56.593 --> 02:59.012
would bring instant fame and publicity.

02:59.095 --> 03:00.347
[gasp]

03:00.388 --> 03:02.182
My favorite four words--

03:02.265 --> 03:04.809
Pu-bli-ci-ty.

03:04.893 --> 03:06.353
One picture of that hairball,

03:06.436 --> 03:08.813
I'd be sellin' cars like
there was no yesterday.

03:08.897 --> 03:12.734
And it wouldn't have
to be authentic, either.

03:12.817 --> 03:14.652
[chuckles]

03:16.821 --> 03:18.907
Sure is generous of you, Petey,

03:18.990 --> 03:20.909

03:20.992 --> 03:23.828
on an all-expenses-paid ski weekend.

03:23.912 --> 03:26.581
Oh, think nothin' of it, Goofster.

03:26.664 --> 03:27.957
It's only money--

03:28.041 --> 03:31.294
79.95 plus 15% gratuity to be exact,

03:31.378 --> 03:32.671
but who's countin'?

03:32.754 --> 03:35.382
But, Dad, how come yesterday

03:35.465 --> 03:37.092
you were sayin' times
were tough, you know,

03:37.175 --> 03:38.843
and we had to tighten the old belt,

03:38.927 --> 03:40.595
and then today you--

03:40.679 --> 03:44.265
[chuckles] Kids, huh? Never know
what they'll say next.

03:44.349 --> 03:47.227
Come on, Junior,
see if we forgot anything.

03:48.144 --> 03:48.978
[blows raspberries]

03:49.062 --> 03:51.147
Don't worry about a thing, Petey!

03:51.231 --> 03:52.982
Me and Maxie'll load her up.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.818
Careful, Dad.

03:54.901 --> 03:59.030
These are Mr. P's super-wax GT specials.

03:59.114 --> 04:04.494
Ow! Oh, got some nice
snap-on bindings, too. Ohh!

04:04.577 --> 04:06.955
Here comes a heavy one, Pop.

04:07.038 --> 04:10.250
Hmm. Looks like this feller
didn't know when to say when.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.421
Whoa-ow!

04:14.504 --> 04:15.922

04:36.276 --> 04:38.069

04:42.365 --> 04:44.034
Uh, say, Petey,

04:44.117 --> 04:45.910

04:45.994 --> 04:48.997

04:49.706 --> 04:51.416
Hey, Goofy!

04:51.499 --> 04:54.961
Think you put on enough
of them stretchy cords?

04:55.045 --> 04:56.504
Almost, Petey.

04:56.588 --> 04:59.049
Just one more for safekeepin'.

05:00.050 --> 05:00.967
Ah-hyuck!

05:01.051 --> 05:02.177
That oughta do it.

05:26.034 --> 05:29.079

a lot better mileage.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.914
-Cool!
-Awesome!

05:30.997 --> 05:32.290
I gotta check out

05:32.374 --> 05:35.168
the slidability factor of this snow.

05:35.669 --> 05:39.464
Wh-wh-whoa!

05:50.600 --> 05:52.310
Hurry it up, Goof.

05:52.394 --> 05:54.396
We gotta hit the ski slopes
before the light fades.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.231
OK, Petey.

05:58.650 --> 06:00.944
They musta forgot their snow tires.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.570
Never mind that.

06:02.654 --> 06:04.280
Just give me my camera equipment.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.116
And careful! It's fragile.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.326
I know, Pete. That's why I packed it

06:08.410 --> 06:09.953
nice and safe at the bottom.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.497
I'm gonna give you a packin'.

Look out, you dumb--

Oh!

Mm. You weren't plannin'

06:24.259 --> 06:26.511

06:26.594 --> 06:27.762

06:27.846 --> 06:28.930
Gimme that!

06:29.014 --> 06:30.932
All right, now listen up, Goof.

06:31.016 --> 06:32.183
You grab the skis,

06:32.267 --> 06:34.352
and I'll carry Mr. Camera.

06:34.436 --> 06:36.438
Ahem. OK, Petey,

06:36.521 --> 06:38.565
if you're sure you can manage.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.734
Hmm. Follow me.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.986
I got an uncanny sense of misdirection.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.362
Ski slopes are this way.

06:44.446 --> 06:45.488
Ouch!

06:45.572 --> 06:47.365
Or are they that way?

06:47.449 --> 06:50.326
Don't worry, Pete. I know
where I'm goin' now.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.661
On second thought...

06:58.418 --> 06:59.794
Thought you was in a hurry

06:59.878 --> 07:01.296
to go skiin', Petey!

07:01.379 --> 07:02.797
That's the restaurant!

[gibbering]

07:05.091 --> 07:06.384
[shouting]

07:06.468 --> 07:09.387
Gawrsh. Guess Petey got
hungry on the drive up.

07:13.516 --> 07:15.185
Good thinkin', Petey--

07:15.268 --> 07:17.145
food to go. Ah-hyuck!

07:18.063 --> 07:19.147
Ah-hyuck!

07:19.230 --> 07:21.191
Thanks for the fancy ski coat, Pete.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.443
Folks sure are giving it the eye.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.820
Aw, that's nothin', Goof.

07:25.904 --> 07:28.531
Wait till ya see
the nice hat I got for you

07:28.615 --> 07:30.408
once we get up to the bunny slope.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.702
But we don't stop at the bunny slope.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.579
This goes straight to the top.

07:34.662 --> 07:36.081
The t-top?

07:38.124 --> 07:42.045
Maybe we should take a taxi instead or--

07:43.713 --> 07:46.049
Don't you worry none, Petey.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.510
Nobody ever falls out of these things.

07:48.593 --> 07:49.636

Aah!

07:49.719 --> 07:51.054

Whoo-hoo!

07:57.310 --> 07:58.687
Yahoo!

07:58.770 --> 08:03.191
And the gold medal
for the lugie competition

08:03.274 --> 08:04.359
goes to...

08:04.442 --> 08:07.278
PJ-J-J and--and Max--Max--Max.

08:07.362 --> 08:09.239
[chuckles]

08:09.322 --> 08:11.366
That's "luge," Peej.

08:11.449 --> 08:13.410
Hey, check it out.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.911
Footprints.

08:14.994 --> 08:17.997
And I bet I know who they belong to.

08:18.081 --> 08:20.208
The Harlem G-Globetrotters?

08:20.291 --> 08:22.711
No! Bigfoot. Come on.

08:22.794 --> 08:25.046
Let's see where these big feet lead.

08:25.130 --> 08:26.965
I already know...

08:27.048 --> 08:28.758
to big trouble.

08:29.467 --> 08:32.429
Ah-hyuck! We sure are way up, Petey.

08:32.512 --> 08:35.765
And to think you used to
have a fear of heights.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.394
Great! We're there.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.938
Nothin' to it, I tell ya.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.314
[chuckles, screams]

08:43.398 --> 08:45.316
Whoa! Aah!

08:45.400 --> 08:48.403
Gimme a hand!

08:50.405 --> 08:53.158
Ah-hyuck! You deserve it, Petey.

08:53.241 --> 08:56.161
That's some fancy hot-dog ski trick.

08:56.244 --> 08:57.245
Ouch!

09:00.665 --> 09:02.917
Hey, Petey, how's this?

09:03.001 --> 09:05.462
Almost got it, Goofer.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.422
A little to the left.

09:07.505 --> 09:08.465
Now hunker down.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.133
Spread your arms wide

09:10.216 --> 09:11.551
and give me a good grunt.

09:11.676 --> 09:13.678
You wanna look like
a real skier, don't you?

09:13.762 --> 09:15.722
Sure do, Pete.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.766
Ooh! Ooh! How's that?

09:17.849 --> 09:19.267
He's a gruntin' fool.

09:19.351 --> 09:21.644
Very professional. Hold that pose, Goof.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.772
Sure got dark early.

09:23.855 --> 09:25.565
Must be mountain time.

09:25.648 --> 09:27.609
Powder's nice and fluffy, though--

09:27.692 --> 09:29.569
perfect for a little night skiin'.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.113
Whoa-hoo-hoo!

09:32.197 --> 09:33.990
What'd ya say, Goof?

09:34.074 --> 09:35.408
Eeh-hoo-hoo!

09:36.826 --> 09:38.578
I'm ready for ya, Goof.

09:39.704 --> 09:41.539
No, no, no, you ijot.

09:41.623 --> 09:42.791
Everything's wrong.

09:42.874 --> 09:44.542
Look. Your hat's on crooked.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.503
[growls]

09:46.586 --> 09:48.922
And your coat's lopsided, too.

09:49.005 --> 09:51.508
Here! Let me straighten it.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.927
Oh, your gruntin's not bad, though.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.637
[growls]

09:55.720 --> 09:57.764
