Dr. Raycraft?

04:51.373 --> 04:53.757
Well, I would have to learn
a little bit more about...

04:53.792 --> 04:55.175
Dr. reid.

04:55.210 --> 04:58.695
I'm a general surgeon,
not an orthopedic surgeon.

04:58.730 --> 05:01.298
Yes, but you are a doctor,
aren't you?

05:01.349 --> 05:03.050
I would save the arm.

05:03.084 --> 05:04.685
Why?

05:04.719 --> 05:05.686
Because if the tumor
doesn't metastasize,

05:05.720 --> 05:07.855
the survival rate is 75%.

05:07.889 --> 05:09.857
Yes, but if it does,
if it goes systemic,

05:09.891 --> 05:12.693
the patient's
5-year survival rate is zero.

05:12.727 --> 05:13.977
You're just playing
a numbers game.

05:14.028 --> 05:14.978
It's because it a numbers game.

05:15.029 --> 05:16.313
What else is there?

05:16.364 --> 05:17.448
Dr. Harris is right.

05:17.482 --> 05:19.783
Percentages are percentages.

smartest guy in the room.

05:21.052 --> 05:22.536

05:22.570 --> 05:25.456
How can you be so sure
of yourself, Dr. Harris?

05:28.993 --> 05:32.429
Because that's my job,

05:32.464 --> 05:34.014
Dr. reid.

05:40.221 --> 05:43.257
I have completely lost

You didn't drink anything
or eat anything?

06:52.193 --> 06:54.628
You said not to, so I didn't.

06:54.662 --> 06:57.214
Okay. We're gonna go through
consent one more time.

06:57.248 --> 06:59.383
This is your arm.

06:59.417 --> 07:01.385
Your tumor is right here,

07:01.419 --> 07:02.603
near the shoulder.

07:02.637 --> 07:03.937
It's stage III.
It's pretty big.

07:03.972 --> 07:05.055
It's also spread
to the lymph nodes,

07:05.089 --> 07:07.174
which is why we need
to remove your arm.

07:07.208 --> 07:08.342
Understood?

As clear as a bell.

What do we have?

07:45.129 --> 07:47.881
This is Angela. She came in
with nonspecific abdominal pain.

07:47.915 --> 07:50.551
Hi, Angela. I'm Dr. reid,
chief surgical resident.

07:50.585 --> 07:53.554
It says here that you've been
having some abdominal cramping.

07:53.588 --> 07:54.855
How long?

07:54.889 --> 07:56.473
Since after breakfast.

07:56.507 --> 07:57.774
She's been, like, crying
and everything.

07:57.809 --> 08:00.277
Okay, Dr. lin,
can you examine her again?

08:03.648 --> 08:05.032
Press.

08:06.267 --> 08:07.701
Ow.

08:07.735 --> 08:10.571
Angela, does it hurt when
she presses or lets go quickly?

08:10.605 --> 08:11.822
Um, when she lets go.

08:11.873 --> 08:13.156
That's rebound tenderness.

08:13.207 --> 08:15.492
Okay, we need to get
some blood work done,

08:15.543 --> 08:17.544
and then if that's okay,
we're gonna get you a C.T.

08:17.579 --> 08:20.414
And see if something's up
with your appendix. Easy.

08:20.448 --> 08:21.715
Is there something else?

08:21.749 --> 08:23.533
No.

08:23.568 --> 08:26.286
Don't worry. The test
will show us what's going on.

08:29.457 --> 08:31.308
I'm sorry.

08:31.342 --> 08:33.927
I was having trouble
examining her because...

08:33.961 --> 08:35.761
She's so... fat.

08:35.796 --> 08:38.097
Maggie, that's the fifth time
you've paged me.

08:38.131 --> 08:41.068
I know. I just... I don't want
to make a mistake.

08:41.102 --> 08:42.486
Take it slow.

08:42.520 --> 08:44.521
Listen to the patients.
Trust the facts. Okay?

08:44.572 --> 08:45.939
Okay. Um...

08:45.973 --> 08:47.190
Yes?

08:47.241 --> 08:49.610
I know this is my first week
rotating in general surgery,

08:49.644 --> 08:51.912
but I was hoping you could
give me the weekend off.

08:51.946 --> 08:53.580
Family reunion.

08:53.615 --> 08:55.248
Ask Dr. Harris.
He's the boss.

08:55.283 --> 08:56.583
I was hoping
you might speak to him?

08:56.618 --> 08:58.168
Uh, hope isn't a plan.
Ask him yourself.

08:59.654 --> 09:01.171
Ejected through the windshield
approximately 10 feet.

09:01.205 --> 09:02.706
I got a penetrating chest wound

09:02.757 --> 09:04.341
and a second pneumothorax.
(Man) I need a room!

09:04.375 --> 09:05.842
Full trauma team.
Get me to the O.R.

09:05.877 --> 09:07.794
(Woman) Prep the O.R.
oh. Hey.

09:07.828 --> 09:10.047
Alex.
(Man speaks indistinctly)

09:10.098 --> 09:12.832
You look like a million bucks,
by the way. Whoo!

09:12.850 --> 09:14.468
(Man) Page thoracics.
Call for the o-negative stat.

09:14.502 --> 09:16.169
(Sighs) (Woman) I'm calling the
blood bank to get the o-neg.

09:19.173 --> 09:21.224
You see? And I was all hopeful
when you paged me.

09:21.275 --> 09:22.392
Oh, yeah?

09:22.443 --> 09:24.361
Yep. I thought that
you needed more surgery.

09:24.395 --> 09:25.729
(Laughs) No.

09:25.780 --> 09:27.147
What you got?

09:27.181 --> 09:29.066
Bus crash victim. He was
talking to the bus driver,

09:29.117 --> 09:30.283
went through the windshield.

09:30.318 --> 09:31.685
Blunt abdominal trauma.

09:31.703 --> 09:32.953
Tap was positive.

09:32.987 --> 09:34.187
Ultrasound?

09:34.205 --> 09:35.706
Uh, fuzzy.

09:35.740 --> 09:37.457
(Monitor beeping steadily)
Get the suction ready.

09:37.492 --> 09:38.692
This guy's gonna go boom.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.334
Whoa. Okay.

09:47.368 --> 09:49.252
(Suction hisses)

09:49.303 --> 09:50.637
What do we got?

09:50.672 --> 09:51.722
There's a long
and deep laceration

09:51.756 --> 09:53.056
in the right lobe of the liver.

09:55.042 --> 09:56.510
Put in a retractor
so I can see the spleen.

09:56.544 --> 09:59.262
Deaver.

10:01.149 --> 10:02.983
(Monitor beeping erratically)
What does it look like?

10:03.017 --> 10:05.218
It's mush.
It's not salvageable.

10:05.236 --> 10:07.821
(Man) B.P.'S 60. I'm having trouble maintaining.
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

10:07.855 --> 10:09.656
Okay, let's leave the spleen
for now, pack it away,

10:09.691 --> 10:11.324
and we'll suture
the liver first.

10:11.359 --> 10:13.276
Sponges.

10:13.327 --> 10:14.828
So how many kids
you wanna have?

10:14.862 --> 10:16.029
What?

10:16.063 --> 10:17.998
You heard me. Could have
one or two if you like,

10:18.032 --> 10:20.917
hell, we could even kick it
catholic school and have three.

10:20.952 --> 10:23.120
(Grunts) Liver suture
and keep them coming.

10:23.171 --> 10:25.288
(Suction gurgles)

10:25.339 --> 10:27.174
Ah.

10:27.208 --> 10:28.625
(Woman speaks indistinctly)

10:28.676 --> 10:31.011
This guy'll be lucky
to make it off the table.

10:31.045 --> 10:33.513
Let's do everything we can.

10:33.548 --> 10:36.049
Anybody hear if the medics
found an organ donor card?

10:36.083 --> 10:38.268
No wallet. No nothing.
Guy's a John Doe.

10:38.302 --> 10:41.354
(Man speaks indistinctly)

10:43.591 --> 10:45.525
Hey, man.
How are you coming in?

10:45.560 --> 10:47.944
Oh, hey. Good. I wish I could
shake your hand. I can't.

10:47.979 --> 10:50.063
No. No. No. No worries.
Welcome to hope-zee.

10:50.097 --> 10:53.767
Hey. Well, you got everything you need?
Yeah, I have. Man, look, I gotta tell you,

10:53.785 --> 10:56.403
it's an honor to be working with you.
Please. The pleasure's ours,

10:56.437 --> 10:58.121
and I'm getting all the credit
for it, so it's even better.

10:58.156 --> 11:00.273
I'm gonna see you at 8:00,
and I'll, uh, I'll see you.

11:00.291 --> 11:02.659
See you later, man.
I thought you started work tomorrow.

11:02.710 --> 11:05.278
Yeah, you know, I figured I'd
sort of settle into the office

11:05.296 --> 11:06.713
and hang some pictures

11:06.748 --> 11:09.633
and, uh, then this whole bus
crash thing happened, so...

11:09.667 --> 11:11.084
Right. I noticed that.

11:11.118 --> 11:12.836
I'm Shahir Hamza.
I'm a neurosurgeon.

11:12.887 --> 11:15.055
Oh, hey, man. I'm Joel Goran.
I'm the...

11:15.089 --> 11:16.790
Orthopedic surgeon.

11:16.824 --> 11:18.058
(Door closes)

11:18.092 --> 11:19.176
It's gonna be weird, isn't it?

11:19.210 --> 11:21.294
Oh, Shahir?

11:21.312 --> 11:23.513
No, he's just like that.
No, I mean you and me.

11:23.564 --> 11:25.232
I mean, you didn't invite me
to the wedding,

11:25.266 --> 11:27.067
so presumably,
you're still in love with me.

11:27.101 --> 11:29.803
(Laughs) Right.
I totally forgot.

11:29.821 --> 11:31.688
I like to remember the poems
you wrote me... Mm-hmm.

11:31.739 --> 11:35.408
The breakfasts in bed,
the nurses you were banging.

11:36.811 --> 11:38.245
Okay, we can stop right there.

11:38.279 --> 11:40.146
No, seriously,
if I'd known you'd be here,

11:40.164 --> 11:41.448
we would have invited you.

11:41.482 --> 11:43.867
If you get off early...
park regency, suite 918.

11:43.918 --> 11:45.418
Open bar.

11:46.487 --> 11:48.171
(Knock on door)

11:48.206 --> 11:49.706
It's a no-go, guys.
You're kidding.

11:49.757 --> 11:51.658
Nope. Emerg got slammed.
O.R.S are backed up.

11:51.676 --> 11:52.793
What can I tell you?

11:52.827 --> 11:54.795
Communication around here
is horrendous.

11:54.829 --> 11:56.379
So we're not doing
my surgery today?

11:56.430 --> 11:58.181
No. Tomorrow.
Tomorrow?

11:58.216 --> 12:00.717
Yep. First thing.
Look, I want this freaking thing off <i>no</i> man.

12:02.470 --> 12:04.604
(Pounds bed)

12:07.942 --> 12:09.226
It's a short wait, Shawn.

12:11.011 --> 12:12.646
Yeah.

12:12.680 --> 12:15.198
(Chuckles) Yeah,
it's... it's all right, man.

12:15.233 --> 12:17.651
So we're good for tomorrow?

12:17.685 --> 12:18.685
All good.

12:20.000 --> 12:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:27.011 --> 12:29.379
It's called Isla Holbox,
off the coast near Cancun.

12:29.413 --> 12:31.381
It's less touristy than
Isla Mujeres, but...

12:31.415 --> 12:33.500
mm. The isle of women.

12:33.534 --> 12:34.868
Yeah, you're not going there
anymore.

12:34.886 --> 12:37.337
(Laughs)
So what does "holbox" mean?

12:37.371 --> 12:38.972
Black hole.

12:39.006 --> 12:40.891
But trust me,
it's gonna be beautiful.

12:40.925 --> 12:43.643
Okay? It's gonna have
white Sandy beaches

12:43.678 --> 12:45.979
and we're gonna pick out food
at the market

12:46.013 --> 12:49.266
and cook it in our own
little hut with a palapa roof.

12:49.317 --> 12:50.600
What about Paris?

12:50.651 --> 12:52.319
I don't know.
I've never been to Paris.

12:52.353 --> 12:53.720
I was always too busy working
or going to school.

12:53.738 --> 12:55.405
Okay, we're... we're going.

12:55.439 --> 12:56.990
I mean, unless
you really don't want to,

12:57.024 --> 13:00.911
'cause black hole island
sounds pretty romantic.

13:00.945 --> 13:03.246
(Exhales deeply) Oh, my God.

13:03.281 --> 13:05.282
What?

13:05.333 --> 13:08.251
Charlie, we're getting married.

13:09.670 --> 13:11.087
(Sighs)

13:13.341 --> 13:14.724
(Pager buzzes)

13:14.759 --> 13:15.976
Mm.

13:16.010 --> 13:17.344
(Sniffs)

13:17.378 --> 13:19.763
(Sighs)
Oh, she cannot be serious.

13:19.814 --> 13:21.231
Go. Go. Go.

13:21.265 --> 13:24.267
(Indistinct conversations)

13:27.071 --> 13:30.073
Dr. lin,
couldn't you get a C.T.?

13:30.107 --> 13:33.026
Uh, no, I couldn't,
because of the radiation.

13:33.060 --> 13:34.494
I'm pregnant.

13:34.528 --> 13:35.829
I'm sorry.
What's your name?

13:35.863 --> 13:36.997
Mitchell.

13:37.031 --> 13:38.448
Mitchell, could you go get
Angela a juice?

13:38.499 --> 13:41.334
They're in the little fridge
down the hall.

13:41.369 --> 13:42.735
Thank you.

13:45.506 --> 13:47.374
Angela,
when was your last period?

13:47.408 --> 13:49.509
Four or five months ago.

13:49.543 --> 13:51.577
Are you sure you didn't know
you were pregnant?

13:53.414 --> 13:55.131
'Cause here's what I think.
I think you kinda knew.

13:55.182 --> 13:59.252
I didn't want him to dump me.

13:59.270 --> 14:03.223
Okay. I can understand that.

14:03.257 --> 14:05.258
I'm just gonna check you, okay?

14:08.595 --> 14:11.531
Tara, you feel like you're
20 or so weeks pregnant.

14:11.565 --> 14:15.151
Congratulations. An ob-gyn
will be able to check for sure.

14:15.202 --> 14:17.103
Let's keep her overnight.
Put her on a fetal monitor.

14:17.121 --> 14:18.655
Yeah.

14:18.706 --> 14:20.606
And, Dr. lin, try not to page
me. I'm going to get married.

14:22.877 --> 14:24.577
Dr. reid?

14:24.611 --> 14:26.162
(Sighs)

14:26.213 --> 14:27.380
Yes?

14:27.415 --> 14:29.466
You look beautiful.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.084
Thank you.

14:34.755 --> 14:36.389
Hey.

14:37.958 --> 14:39.259
(Squeals)

14:39.293 --> 14:40.477
Wait. Wait.

14:40.511 --> 14:41.728
Sorry. (Laughs)

14:41.762 --> 14:43.847
The shoes were expensive.

14:45.266 --> 14:46.232
Hey.

14:46.267 --> 14:47.633
You good? You good?

14:47.652 --> 14:49.135
Yep. Hop in.
All right.

14:49.153 --> 14:50.803
My love.

14:53.774 --> 14:55.141
(Tires screech, glass shatters)

14:55.159 --> 14:57.577
Still not withdrawing
from pain. What do you think?

14:57.611 --> 14:58.862
It's a venous bleed.
It's... it's okay,

14:58.913 --> 15:00.163
but if it's his meningeal
artery, he could cone.

15:00.197 --> 15:01.748
Now coning is when...

15:01.782 --> 15:03.667
I know what coning is!
It's when the pressure of his brain

15:03.701 --> 15:05.151
goes down to the spinal cord,

15:05.169 --> 15:07.253
the pressure, essentially,
could... could crush his brain.

15:07.288 --> 15:09.506
And he could die.

15:09.540 --> 15:11.875
<i>I could die?</i>

15:11.926 --> 15:15.295
<i>What the hell does that</i>
<i>even mean?</i>

15:15.329 --> 15:17.663
<i>Okay. This is weird.</i>

15:17.682 --> 15:19.165
We'll take it from here.

15:19.183 --> 15:20.717
I'm coming with you.

15:20.768 --> 15:23.053
You're not a neurosurgeon, Alex.
There's nothing you can do.

15:23.104 --> 15:24.604
I'm not leaving him.

15:26.774 --> 15:30.110
<i>See, doctors like tests.</i>

15:30.144 --> 15:32.362
<i>It's the unknown</i>
<i>that scares them.</i>

15:32.396 --> 15:33.513
(Door squeaks)

15:35.682 --> 15:38.118
<i>Yeah, this is exactly</i>
<i>what I would do...</i>

15:38.152 --> 15:41.905
<i>see what's going on</i>
<i>in my brain.</i>

15:41.956 --> 15:43.573
(Beep)

15:43.624 --> 15:46.543
(Whirring)

15:48.979 --> 15:53.500
<i>I can tell you</i>
<i>what's going on in my mind.</i>

15:53.534 --> 15:57.203
<i>And I wish I could hold you,</i>
<i>Alex,</i>

15:57.221 --> 15:59.806
<i>and tell you</i>
<i>that I'm gonna be okay...</i>

16:02.209 --> 16:04.344
<i>But I can't.</i>

16:04.378 --> 16:06.546
<i>And you know what?</i>

16:06.564 --> 16:09.399
<i>There's no test for this.</i>

16:09.433 --> 16:13.903
<i>I am having</i>
<i>an out-of-body experience</i>

16:13.938 --> 16:15.939
<i>in a tuxedo.</i>

16:18.609 --> 16:21.077
<i>Wake up, you dumb bastard.</i>

16:32.673 --> 16:34.040
Anything?

16:34.074 --> 16:36.843
No change.

16:40.047 --> 16:43.216
Everybody keeps telling me
to...

16:43.250 --> 16:45.051
to go home?

16:47.555 --> 16:49.222
Yeah.

16:50.808 --> 16:52.275
I can't.

16:52.309 --> 16:55.161
Then don't.

16:55.196 --> 16:56.813
Your family's here.

17:00.067 --> 17:02.068
So what am I supposed to do?

17:02.102 --> 17:04.537
Suit up.

17:04.571 --> 17:06.289
(Inhales sharply)

17:06.323 --> 17:08.657
Pit your scrubs on,
Dr. reid.

17:08.709 --> 17:10.326
Get to work.

17:16.383 --> 17:19.335
(Crying)

17:35.100 --> 17:38.102
{Pub}(Monitor beeping steadily)

17:44.960 --> 17:46.860
He's bradycardic,
and his pressure's up.

17:46.895 --> 17:48.128
It is slightly.

17:48.163 --> 17:50.497
But the C.T. showed
a venous bleed,

17:50.532 --> 17:52.416
so unless something changes,
we don't need to operate yet.

17:59.090 --> 18:01.425
(Clears throat) Do you want
some time alone with him?

18:01.459 --> 18:03.377
Without me?

18:03.411 --> 18:05.546
No. He's being looked after.

18:05.580 --> 18:07.914
(Pager buzzes)
(Nurse) I can leave if you like.

18:07.932 --> 18:09.350
It's fine.

18:10.769 --> 18:12.219
Gotta go.

18:12.253 --> 18:15.639
<i>Okay, hypothetical...</i>

18:15.674 --> 18:19.059
<i>you're on an airplane</i>
<i>going to Miami,</i>

18:19.093 --> 18:20.694
<i>but you land in helsinki.</i>

18:20.729 --> 18:22.396
Hey.

18:22.430 --> 18:23.731
<i>And that's fine.</i>

18:23.765 --> 18:25.532
You can see me?

18:25.567 --> 18:27.401
Yeah. Can you see me?

18:27.435 --> 18:31.038
Yeah. 'Cause I'm...
I'm talking to you.

18:32.207 --> 18:34.825
Right. What's going on?

18:34.876 --> 18:36.276
Um...

18:36.294 --> 18:38.879
I'm in a coma.

18:38.913 --> 18:40.631
Am I in a coma?

18:40.665 --> 18:42.132
No, you... you died.

18:42.167 --> 18:43.834
We did everything we could.

18:45.220 --> 18:46.387
Sorry about that.

18:46.421 --> 18:48.255
It's not what I pictured.

18:48.289 --> 18:51.175
Yep. I know what you mean.

18:51.226 --> 18:53.960
I haven't even seen my wife.

18:53.978 --> 18:55.262
I don't think she's coming.

18:55.296 --> 18:56.513
You have a wife?

18:56.564 --> 18:58.182
Yeah, and, uh, a daughter.

18:59.517 --> 19:03.320
Yeah. See, we had you declared
a John Doe.

19:03.355 --> 19:04.905
Couldn't find your wallet.

19:04.939 --> 19:06.023
(Chuckles)

19:06.074 --> 19:07.658
That's funny. Uh...

19:07.692 --> 19:09.276
I like to gamble, so I, uh,

19:09.310 --> 19:11.612
I just take cash with me
so I don't go over my limit.

19:11.646 --> 19:13.113
Right.

19:13.147 --> 19:15.332
I'm sorry. What's your name?
Uh, Charlie. Charles.

19:15.367 --> 19:17.084
Charles, I gotta be honest
with you.

19:17.118 --> 19:19.152
I-I don't think I'm coping
all that well with things.

19:19.170 --> 19:21.038
You know, maybe I should
find this more intriguing...

19:21.089 --> 19:22.706
being able to see everything...

19:22.757 --> 19:26.093
it beats the void, you know,
nothingness, but, uh...

19:26.127 --> 19:29.096
I don't know about you.

19:29.130 --> 19:30.431
I'm lonely.

19:32.684 --> 19:34.885
Yep. I'm... I'm getting there,
John.

19:34.936 --> 19:36.520
That's not my name.

19:36.554 --> 19:39.857
(Sighs) I'm sorry.
What is your name?

19:47.565 --> 19:49.450
Almost done.

19:49.484 --> 19:50.484
(Curtain rings swoosh)

19:50.518 --> 19:52.069
You paged me?

19:52.120 --> 19:54.488
Yeah, I'm sure I should be able
to figure this out myself,

19:54.522 --> 19:58.742
but I am stymied as to why
Tara here swallowed this.

19:58.793 --> 19:59.993
Daffodil bulb.

20:00.027 --> 20:01.211
Yeah.

20:01.246 --> 20:03.997
Highly toxic and causes
convulsions and death.

20:04.031 --> 20:07.134
Okay, I'm just gonna
pull out the tube now. Okay?

20:07.168 --> 20:08.836
(Tape rips)

20:08.870 --> 20:10.137
(Coughs)
Hey, Tara.

20:10.171 --> 20:12.723
My name's Gavin Murphy.

20:12.757 --> 20:14.308
I'm a psych resident
here at hope-zee.

20:14.342 --> 20:15.809
Do you mind if I ask you
a couple questions?

20:15.844 --> 20:17.127
Sure.

20:17.162 --> 20:19.930
You know the daffodil bulb
was toxic when you ate it?

20:19.981 --> 20:21.448
Why would I have eaten it
if I knew that?

20:21.483 --> 20:23.183
If you wanted to hurt yourself.

20:23.217 --> 20:26.403
Why would I do that?

20:26.438 --> 20:29.406
Will you hand me my jacket?

20:29.441 --> 20:31.108
Are you cold?

20:31.159 --> 20:32.893
No. There's a pizza bagel
in there,

20:32.911 --> 20:36.113
and I'm hungry because I just
got my stomach pumped.

20:39.451 --> 20:42.669
I didn't try to kill myself,
okay?

20:42.704 --> 20:44.621
You trying to get high?
No.

20:44.656 --> 20:46.757
You trying to lose weight?
No.

20:46.791 --> 20:48.041
Something all the kids
are doing?

20:48.075 --> 20:49.960
No!
Then what was it?

20:51.463 --> 20:53.964
(Lowered voice)
It was a love potion.

20:54.015 --> 20:55.516
I'm sorry?

20:55.550 --> 20:58.435
(Mouth full)
It was a love potion.

20:58.470 --> 20:59.770
Can't hear you.

20:59.804 --> 21:00.971
(Loudly) It was
a love potion, all right?

21:01.022 --> 21:02.973
A love potion.

21:03.024 --> 21:06.092
I drank it, then I gave some
to this boy I like.

21:06.110 --> 21:08.695
Now I want to die.

21:10.765 --> 21:12.783
<i>(Grunting)</i>

21:12.817 --> 21:13.951
<i>(Man) Aah!</i>

21:13.985 --> 21:15.486
Who are you?

21:15.537 --> 21:18.205
Hey. I'm Joel Goran.
I'll be performing your surgery.

21:18.239 --> 21:19.773
<i>(Men screaming)</i>

21:19.791 --> 21:20.891
Where's Dr. Harris?

21:20.925 --> 21:23.911
I'm... afraid
he's unavailable.

21:23.945 --> 21:26.046
Today?
Because I mean, I'll wait.

21:26.080 --> 21:28.749
No, he can't do the surgery
at all. Um, but it's okay,

21:28.783 --> 21:30.584
because I'll be looking
after all of his patients.

21:30.618 --> 21:32.753
I don't want a new doctor,
okay?

21:32.787 --> 21:34.671
Unfortunately,
you don't have a choice.

21:34.722 --> 21:36.840
Kinda what you got.

21:36.891 --> 21:38.642
But I'm good, so...

21:40.228 --> 21:43.347
Uh, Shawn,
I'm looking over your stuff.

21:43.398 --> 21:47.401
Has anyone spoken to you
about limb-sparing surgery?

21:47.435 --> 21:49.520
Yeah, Dr. Harris. Why?

21:49.571 --> 21:51.405
I mean we should have
another talk about it.

21:51.439 --> 21:54.324
Limb-sparing surgery... it's
exactly what it sounds like.

21:54.359 --> 21:56.109
What we do is we make
a wide incision,

21:56.143 --> 21:57.578
we cut out the belly
of the muscle,

21:57.612 --> 21:59.580
then we use radiation
and chemo,

21:59.614 --> 22:02.249
and we could maybe
spare your arm that way.

22:02.283 --> 22:03.667
I have
a grade III fibrosarcoma.

22:03.701 --> 22:05.252
I understand that. I'm not
making any promises here.

22:05.286 --> 22:06.453
I just feel like
if we can take a shot,

22:06.487 --> 22:07.921
we should probably
take the shot, right?

22:07.956 --> 22:09.790
Shawn, what do you do
for a living?

22:09.824 --> 22:11.542
Look, I work at a gas station,
but tell me...

22:11.593 --> 22:13.961
are you here to sign my arm or what?
I don't know.

22:13.995 --> 22:15.762
Are you postponing
my surgery again?

22:15.797 --> 22:18.098
I don't know.

22:19.667 --> 22:21.001
(Sighs deeply)

22:22.820 --> 22:25.138
(Angela) Ow! Ow!
What's going on?

22:25.172 --> 22:27.641
I don't know. Temp's 37.5.
B.P.'S 130 and on 80.

22:27.675 --> 22:28.692
I have to go to the bathroom.

22:28.726 --> 22:29.810
Maggie,
do you know what this is?

22:29.844 --> 22:31.778
A vag... a baby's head.

22:31.813 --> 22:34.531
She's crowning. I need an ob-gyn
and N.I.C.U. stat.

22:34.566 --> 22:35.949
And get that bed out of here.

22:35.984 --> 22:37.451
A little help here.
Ow!

22:37.485 --> 22:39.953
All right, Angela, you're gonna
have your baby now, all right?

22:39.988 --> 22:41.521
We're gonna do this together

22:41.539 --> 22:43.206
because we need
to get this baby out.

22:43.241 --> 22:44.357
I need you to push.

22:44.375 --> 22:45.626
I don't know how to push.

22:45.660 --> 22:47.244
Just take a breath
and bear down when I tell you.

22:47.295 --> 22:48.745
You just need to listen
to your body.

22:48.796 --> 22:50.380
Maggie, grab her foot
and brace it.

22:50.415 --> 22:51.498
I'm not ready for this!

22:51.532 --> 22:52.916
You are. You are.

22:52.967 --> 22:54.468
Come on.
I know you can do this. Push.

22:54.502 --> 22:56.003
Oh, that hurts! Ohh!
I know it hurts.

22:56.037 --> 22:58.472
I know it hurts, but you need
to push through the pain.

22:58.506 --> 23:00.474
So take a nice, deep breath.
Ready?

23:00.508 --> 23:01.725
(Inhales deeply)
And push.

23:01.759 --> 23:04.311
Ohh!

23:04.345 --> 23:06.096
Okay, I got one shoulder. You're
gonna need one more push.

23:06.147 --> 23:07.314
You got one more push in you,
Angela.

23:07.348 --> 23:10.567
One more deep, giant push.
You want this baby.

23:10.602 --> 23:12.736
Ohh! I want my baby!

23:12.770 --> 23:14.021
Ready? Push.

23:14.055 --> 23:15.989
Aah!

23:16.024 --> 23:17.357
(Grunts)

23:17.391 --> 23:21.695
(Panting)

23:21.729 --> 23:23.830
(Baby crying)

23:25.750 --> 23:27.584
There you go.

23:27.619 --> 23:29.169
You have a baby boy.

23:29.203 --> 23:32.673
He's tiny, but he's breathing.

23:32.707 --> 23:35.092
I can't believe it.

23:35.126 --> 23:36.760
He's so beautiful.

23:38.296 --> 23:39.930
She's ready. She's ready.

23:39.964 --> 23:42.415
(Woman speaks indistinctly)

23:45.520 --> 23:47.054
Hey.

23:47.088 --> 23:49.773
You okay?

23:49.807 --> 23:51.642
(Alex) Congratulations,
Angela.

23:52.810 --> 23:54.277
Born at 10:32.

24:04.706 --> 24:06.039
(Monitor beeping steadily)

24:06.074 --> 24:10.077
Yes, I understand that
the deposit is nonrefundable

24:10.111 --> 24:12.963
and I am absolutely willing
to pay for the suite.

24:12.997 --> 24:14.915
Okay? I just...

24:14.949 --> 24:17.300
I have to cancel the reservation
for the weekend,

24:17.335 --> 24:19.836
and if you could do that for me,
it would be... great.

24:19.887 --> 24:21.638
Thank you.

24:29.681 --> 24:31.098
Ch...

24:33.901 --> 24:35.468
Charlie.

24:40.108 --> 24:41.908
I know that I should talk
to you.

24:41.943 --> 24:43.744
I'm sorry.

24:43.778 --> 24:45.662
I know that I should.

24:45.697 --> 24:47.414
(Monitor beeping erratically)

24:47.448 --> 24:50.167

Yes. Yes.

25:03.381 --> 25:05.382
Still in V.F.
All right, let's... let's shock him.

25:05.433 --> 25:07.684
I got this. I got this.
Hey, Alex. Hey, no, you don't.

25:07.719 --> 25:09.352
I got it. Okay?

25:09.387 --> 25:10.721
Goran, 5 epi.

25:10.772 --> 25:12.889

25:12.940 --> 25:14.107

25:14.142 --> 25:15.108
Let's get him down.
Get him down.

25:15.143 --> 25:16.309
5 c.C.S epi.

25:16.343 --> 25:17.728
Clear.

25:17.779 --> 25:20.447

All right, what's the rhythm?

25:20.481 --> 25:21.815

Yes, I do.

(Nurse) He's returning
to normal-size rhythm.

25:33.861 --> 25:37.581
His I.C.P.'S through the roof.
He needs a craniotomy stat.

25:37.632 --> 25:39.750
Could I get, uh, doctor...
what is his name?

25:39.801 --> 25:41.468
Hamza. Go get Dr. Hamza.

25:41.502 --> 25:43.086
(Monitor beeping steadily)

25:43.137 --> 25:46.339

27:03.831 --> 27:06.132
Not appendicitis.
No allergies.

27:06.166 --> 27:08.584
Stuart here thinks
it might be suicide attempt.

27:14.758 --> 27:16.676
Mm-hmm.

27:16.710 --> 27:18.478
Daffodil root poisoning.

27:18.512 --> 27:20.713
Really?

27:20.731 --> 27:22.482
You mean he ate a daffodil?

27:22.516 --> 27:23.900
The root, actually.

27:23.934 --> 27:26.652
I've never even heard of that.
How do you know that?

27:26.687 --> 27:29.272

We good to rock 'n' roll?

27:45.339 --> 27:46.456
Yep. Yeah.

27:46.507 --> 27:48.257
Great.

27:48.292 --> 27:50.293
I have a couple of questions
I want to ask you first, though.

27:52.079 --> 27:55.598
You didn't tell me
you were in Afghanistan.

27:55.632 --> 27:58.885
That's none
of your business, doc.

27:58.919 --> 28:01.237
Well, I googled you.

28:01.271 --> 28:04.173
Turns out
you're kind of a hero.

28:04.208 --> 28:06.859
You saved a bunch of guys' lives
in an ambush,

28:06.894 --> 28:09.395
and you have
an engineering degree?

28:09.429 --> 28:10.596
So?

28:10.614 --> 28:13.649
You told me you work
at a gas station.

28:15.352 --> 28:17.453
You might have
post-traumatic stress.

28:19.823 --> 28:21.941
Watched a bunch of people
get blown up for no reason.

28:21.959 --> 28:23.993
I probably do.

28:24.027 --> 28:26.329
I think it's also possible
you have survivor guilt.

28:26.380 --> 28:28.064
Everyone who doesn't die
over there has survivor guilt.

28:28.098 --> 28:29.799
(Sighs)

28:29.833 --> 28:31.584
I think you want this arm off

28:31.618 --> 28:35.304
'cause it's gonna make you
feel like this is... fair.

28:39.626 --> 28:41.577
Have you thought about talking
to a psychiatrist?

28:41.612 --> 28:43.763
Did that, man,
at the V.A. Hospital.

28:43.797 --> 28:45.765
They gave me
five different kind of pills

28:45.799 --> 28:47.567
and then they found my cancer.

28:47.601 --> 28:49.402
Look, I'm here
because Charlie Harris is

28:49.436 --> 28:51.020
supposed to be a great surgeon,
okay?

28:51.071 --> 28:52.855
Now you got me
talking to shrinks again?

28:52.906 --> 28:54.824
I just want my tumor
dealt with, man. That's it.

28:57.628 --> 28:59.912
I think it's more than that.

28:59.947 --> 29:01.480
So what, man?

29:03.917 --> 29:07.703
<i>What if we did get to know</i>
<i>our patients?</i>

29:07.754 --> 29:10.256
<i>What makes them happy...</i>

29:10.290 --> 29:12.925
<i>Or sad?</i>

29:12.960 --> 29:14.827
<i>Would it help us?</i>

29:16.096 --> 29:17.997
<i>Would it help them?</i>

29:22.553 --> 29:24.003
Hey.

29:24.021 --> 29:25.021
Hey. How you feeling?

29:25.055 --> 29:28.291
So sleepy.

29:28.325 --> 29:30.359
Do you need anything?

29:30.394 --> 29:32.879
No.

29:35.199 --> 29:37.133
But...

29:37.167 --> 29:41.070
I've kinda been thinking
about the baby.

29:41.104 --> 29:45.107
We should probably get it
some diapers

29:45.142 --> 29:47.743
or clothes and stuff.

29:47.794 --> 29:49.629
Maybe I can go down
to the gift shop,

29:49.663 --> 29:51.047
get him a little bear
or something.

29:51.081 --> 29:54.700
(Chuckles) He's too little
for toys.

29:57.621 --> 29:59.088
Mitchell?

30:00.657 --> 30:02.158
Do you love me?

30:02.192 --> 30:03.492
(Monitor beeping erratically)

30:03.527 --> 30:06.312
Angela?

30:06.346 --> 30:09.182
(Wheezes)

30:09.216 --> 30:10.766
(Gasps) What's going on?
Angela, are you okay?

30:10.817 --> 30:12.768
Angela! Nurse!

(Sighs)

30:31.088 --> 30:32.672
Mitchell?

30:32.706 --> 30:36.242
I don't understand.
She can't be dead.

30:36.260 --> 30:38.761
She had what's called
a pulmonary embolism.

30:38.795 --> 30:40.963
There were massive blood clots
that went into her lungs.

30:41.014 --> 30:43.182
We did everything we could do.

30:43.217 --> 30:44.967
I was just talking to her.

30:45.018 --> 30:48.604
15 minutes ago,
she said she was sleepy.

30:48.639 --> 30:52.058
I am so, so sorry, Mitchell.

30:52.092 --> 30:55.478
(Sighs)

30:57.597 --> 30:59.232
(Man) Let's get
these charts organized.

30:59.266 --> 31:00.616
I know this is terrible timing,

31:00.651 --> 31:05.204
but... we do need
to talk about your son.

31:07.274 --> 31:10.276
(Whooshing)

31:13.664 --> 31:16.048
Someone has to make decisions
for him.

31:16.083 --> 31:17.333
Can't you ask her parents?

31:17.384 --> 31:18.784
You're the father.

31:20.954 --> 31:26.058
Look, I know right now
it just seems like some baby...

31:26.093 --> 31:27.510
But it's your baby.

31:30.347 --> 31:33.232
And...

31:33.267 --> 31:35.167
It just needs time.

31:35.202 --> 31:37.136
Babies go from unknowable

31:37.154 --> 31:40.623
to... to cute to...

31:40.657 --> 31:42.091
Miraculous.

31:42.125 --> 31:44.110
It builds.

31:44.144 --> 31:45.695
And next thing you know,

31:45.746 --> 31:47.863
you'll be teaching him
how to ride a bike, and...

31:47.914 --> 31:50.449
It'll be the best day
of your life.

31:50.484 --> 31:52.335
Do you have kids?

31:52.369 --> 31:54.503
No.

31:56.823 --> 31:58.791
Can I put him up for adoption?

31:58.825 --> 32:00.960
I can put you in touch
with a social worker.

32:00.994 --> 32:02.878
Okay.

32:02.929 --> 32:06.048
But you don't have to make that
decision now. You have time.

32:06.099 --> 32:07.300
I don't need time.
Mitchell.

32:07.334 --> 32:10.519
This baby killed Angela.
I don't want it.

32:59.367 --> 33:00.467
Yeah.

33:00.501 --> 33:02.970
Dr. reid, hey, um,
I was at the accident

33:03.004 --> 33:05.405
yesterday with you
and Dr. Harris.

33:06.741 --> 33:08.475
Oh.

33:08.509 --> 33:10.577
Right. Well, you guys
did a good job. Thanks.

33:10.612 --> 33:12.763
Um...

33:12.814 --> 33:16.016
We found this when we were
cleaning out the rig.

33:17.485 --> 33:18.852
Thanks.

33:18.886 --> 33:20.237
Take care, okay?

33:22.857 --> 33:24.324
Yeah.

33:31.332 --> 33:34.618
(Monitor beeping steadily)

33:36.904 --> 33:42.242
(Pen clicks) Charlie is, uh,
stable after the craniotomy.

33:42.260 --> 33:44.878
Relieved the pressure and his,
uh, his vitals are all right.

33:44.912 --> 33:45.962
Good.

33:46.014 --> 33:47.597
Do you know
where his parents live?

33:47.632 --> 33:49.883
No, they're both dead.

33:49.917 --> 33:51.018
Brothers or sisters?

33:51.052 --> 33:52.352
No.

33:52.387 --> 33:54.438
Then we need to talk about
how far you want us to go.

33:54.472 --> 33:56.189
We had to resuscitate him.

33:56.224 --> 33:58.975
This may be the first
of many interventions.

33:59.027 --> 34:01.061
Oh.

34:01.095 --> 34:02.446
We're having the talk.

34:02.480 --> 34:04.114
Alex...
no.

34:04.148 --> 34:06.950
I know what this is.
We don't have to do this.

34:06.984 --> 34:10.454
We do.
Charlie is in a coma.

34:10.487 --> 34:13.123
We need to consider the quality
of life as well as quantity.

34:13.157 --> 34:14.658
You want me to tell you whether
I want to resuscitate him

34:14.708 --> 34:16.376
if he codes again?
Yes.

34:16.411 --> 34:17.878
I can't do that.

34:17.911 --> 34:18.978
You have to.

34:19.013 --> 34:21.831
(Sighs)

34:21.882 --> 34:23.500

34:31.426 --> 34:33.844
(Sniffles and clears throat)
Come in.

34:37.181 --> 34:38.482
You need something?

34:38.516 --> 34:40.484
About to ask you
the same question.

34:44.489 --> 34:45.772
How you doing?

34:45.806 --> 34:48.257
I do better when I'm busy.

34:48.292 --> 34:49.993
What are you...

34:50.027 --> 34:52.478
Medic dropped it off.

34:54.648 --> 34:58.452
You know, I only ever
tried it on once.

34:58.486 --> 35:01.455
Charlie and I picked it out
together.

35:01.489 --> 35:02.539
It's gonna be okay.

35:02.573 --> 35:04.257
You seriously believe that?

35:04.292 --> 35:05.742
Yeah.

35:05.777 --> 35:08.378
Shahir asked me
about a D.N.R.

35:10.681 --> 35:12.265
That's a hard call.

35:12.300 --> 35:14.201
Do I really want to put him
through all the crap

35:14.235 --> 35:16.436
of a series of interventions,
cracking his ribs,

35:16.471 --> 35:18.688
filling his body with drugs,

35:18.723 --> 35:20.223
every indignity,

35:20.274 --> 35:22.025
when he's just
gonna die anyway?

35:22.059 --> 35:23.360
Charlie's not gonna die.

35:23.394 --> 35:27.180
Come on, Joel, he is. He has
some brain function maybe,

35:27.198 --> 35:29.449
but the rest is just machines.

35:29.484 --> 35:30.650
No, you don't know that.

35:30.684 --> 35:32.119
Yes, I do and so do you.

35:32.153 --> 35:33.403
No, I don't.

35:33.454 --> 35:35.355
I mean, look at Shawn price.

35:35.373 --> 35:37.374
You know, I can either cut
that kid's arm off

35:37.408 --> 35:38.742
or I can try and save it,
so I don't know,

35:38.793 --> 35:41.461
why don't I try
the option of...

35:41.496 --> 35:44.080
Thinking you're not screwed?

35:44.132 --> 35:46.032
You don't get to come in here

35:46.050 --> 35:48.718
and pretend you're the only
doctor who cares about patients.

35:48.753 --> 35:50.554
Okay, where the hell
did that come from?

35:50.588 --> 35:54.841
Charlie is twice the surgeon
you will ever be.

35:54.875 --> 35:57.677
Amputate the arm.
That's what he was gonna do.

35:57.711 --> 35:58.812
I'm not Charlie.

35:58.846 --> 36:01.231
No kidding!
This is life and death.

36:01.265 --> 36:02.983
You have to be aggressive.

36:03.017 --> 36:05.402
Okay, when did this become about
you telling me how to do my job?

36:05.436 --> 36:07.437
When you came in here
and started soft-pedaling me

36:07.488 --> 36:09.072
like I don't know the facts.
You know what?

36:09.106 --> 36:12.025
I came in here because I was
trying to be nice to you.

36:12.059 --> 36:13.794
Well, don't be nice.

36:13.828 --> 36:17.280
'Cause you're a lot of things,
Joel, but you're not nice.

36:17.331 --> 36:20.584

36:20.618 --> 36:23.420

36:27.625 --> 36:29.242
Gavin Murphy.
I'm a psych resident here. Hey.

36:29.260 --> 36:30.844
I caught the consult
with Shawn price.

36:30.878 --> 36:32.095
Ah, right.

36:32.129 --> 36:33.213
He has P.T.S.D.

36:33.247 --> 36:35.465
Yeah.

36:35.516 --> 36:38.585
So obviously, I don't think
he's in any shape

36:38.603 --> 36:40.437
to be making decisions
on amputation.

36:40.471 --> 36:42.856
Well ,we're gonna go ahead
with the surgery. Thank you.

36:42.890 --> 36:45.859
Okay, uh, with all due respect,

36:45.893 --> 36:47.477
he's got a lot of issues
tied up in that arm.

36:47.528 --> 36:49.396
Let me ask you something, man.

36:49.430 --> 36:51.815
Do you think being a doctor
automatically makes you smarter

36:51.866 --> 36:54.100
than the patient?

36:54.118 --> 36:55.569
Depends who you're talking to.

36:55.603 --> 36:57.988
Oh, you're talking to me.

36:58.039 --> 37:01.107
Look, this kid wants
his arm off.

37:01.125 --> 37:02.942
I don't think
he's entirely wrong.

37:02.960 --> 37:05.629
(Siren wails)

37:12.286 --> 37:15.222

37:47.397 --> 37:48.898
Oh, God. Get out.

37:48.932 --> 37:50.098
How you feeling, Shawn?

37:50.116 --> 37:51.534
What do you think?
You didn't do my surgery.

37:51.568 --> 37:53.235
I changed my mind.
No, you can't do that.

37:53.269 --> 37:54.537
You didn't do what I wanted.

37:54.571 --> 37:56.238
I performed
the limb-sparing surgery.

37:56.273 --> 37:58.073
All right?
We've removed the tumor.

37:58.107 --> 37:59.625
It's much better, believe me.

37:59.659 --> 38:00.693
I signed a consent.

38:00.727 --> 38:02.211
Look, in all truth,

38:02.245 --> 38:04.330
I got in there,
I just could not do it.

38:04.381 --> 38:06.165
I can't watch
you punish yourself

38:06.199 --> 38:08.217
for surviving a war, Shawn.

38:08.251 --> 38:11.086
You don't know
anything about me.

38:11.121 --> 38:12.755
You haven't seen
the stuff that I've seen

38:12.789 --> 38:14.590
and you... you... you haven't
walked where I walked.

38:14.624 --> 38:16.308
Maybe not, but I've seen
a lot of death in my time.

38:16.343 --> 38:19.061
Oh, yeah? You have anyone die
for you lately?

38:19.095 --> 38:20.846
No.

38:20.897 --> 38:23.499
(Scoffs) Look...

38:26.269 --> 38:28.187
Shawn, I was gonna perform
the amputation

38:28.238 --> 38:30.973
'cause that's what Dr. Harris
was gonna do.

38:30.991 --> 38:33.325
I felt guilty a-about that,

38:33.360 --> 38:35.361
you know,
I felt a sense of duty.

38:35.412 --> 38:39.248
I think it's what you felt
towards your fallen comrades.

38:41.384 --> 38:43.752
Live your life.

38:45.171 --> 38:46.455
(Door opens)

38:46.489 --> 38:50.092

39:16.019 --> 39:19.071
Yeah. Of course.

39:21.491 --> 39:24.209
You sure it won't hurt him?

39:24.244 --> 39:26.211
Yeah.

39:26.246 --> 39:28.464
It's good for him,
to be touched.

39:28.498 --> 39:30.883
Okay, I'm just going to try this
and see how it goes.

39:30.917 --> 39:32.668

40:05.234 --> 40:06.285
No, you won't.

I'll be here just in case.

No.

would you just go?

40:53.049 --> 40:55.334
I had a bad day.

41:00.874 --> 41:05.444
I lost a patient and... and...

41:05.478 --> 41:08.914
Normally, I would...

41:08.948 --> 41:10.516
Tell you about it.
