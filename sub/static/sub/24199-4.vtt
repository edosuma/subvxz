00:13.372 --> 00:14.572
Mom. Are you...?

00:14.612 --> 00:16.111
Go back to your car.
Now!

00:16.192 --> 00:18.832
You were supposed to do
what you were told to do.

00:18.962 --> 00:20.762
I thought you were...
You left your position.

00:20.832 --> 00:23.432
If anybody else on the team
did that, they'd be finished.

00:23.502 --> 00:25.502
I think there's a lot
to talk about here.

00:25.542 --> 00:26.832
There isn't, Philip.

00:26.972 --> 00:28.402
Here's a new target.

00:28.542 --> 00:31.142
He's a supervisor at the
warehouse where Altheon ships

00:31.212 --> 00:33.562
and does quality assurance
for the sensors.

00:33.692 --> 00:35.432
What do they need
the sensor for?

00:35.462 --> 00:37.192
I ca... I can't.

00:37.202 --> 00:39.202
Some very powerful people

00:39.202 --> 00:41.102
are out there
to get rid of Gorbachev.

00:41.232 --> 00:43.502
We want you to find out
what your wife is doing

00:43.642 --> 00:44.842
and tell us.

00:44.872 --> 00:47.972
And if you have to...
stop her.

00:48.042 --> 00:49.722
They want us to be
just like them.

00:49.792 --> 00:51.762
I don't want to be like them.

00:51.892 --> 00:53.902
And neither do
the people back home.

00:54.032 --> 00:57.832
You haven't talked to anyone
back home in over twenty years.

00:57.902 --> 00:59.402
Neither have you.

01:04.412 --> 01:07.162
Your English is very good.

01:07.192 --> 01:08.632
I lived here.

01:08.762 --> 01:11.332
Worked for us at the embassy.

01:11.402 --> 01:13.762
Did you like it here?

01:13.902 --> 01:15.902
I don't know.

01:15.942 --> 01:19.242
It's different.

01:19.372 --> 01:20.972
What about you?

01:21.012 --> 01:23.822
I've been here a long time.

01:23.892 --> 01:27.162
Sometimes, it's even hard
to remember back home.

01:27.232 --> 01:28.732
Yeah.

01:30.572 --> 01:34.072
One thing I learned here
is that they are not crazy.

01:36.342 --> 01:38.142
We can make peace with them.

01:39.442 --> 01:42.562
Now maybe is the best chance
we'll ever get.

01:44.232 --> 01:45.532
That's why I'm here.

01:47.172 --> 01:51.442
I don't really understand
what's going on.

01:51.502 --> 01:53.042
What you said before...

02:01.162 --> 02:04.432
The people  running
the Centre,

02:04.472 --> 02:08.372
we believe, are actively trying
to get rid of Gorbachev.

02:08.442 --> 02:10.741
And they can't stand
the progress.

02:10.812 --> 02:13.722
It's a threat to them.

02:13.762 --> 02:16.592
Our country having

02:16.602 --> 02:23.072
Any kind of openness or freedom.

02:23.142 --> 02:26.102
They think it means that
we won't be communists anymore.

02:29.682 --> 02:32.232
Who's on the other side?

02:32.302 --> 02:34.102
Arkady Ivanovich.

02:34.102 --> 02:37.632
He is deputy chief
of Directorate S.

02:39.302 --> 02:40.772
Everybody in the whole country

02:40.772 --> 02:43.872
who is looking forwards
and not backwards.

02:44.012 --> 02:45.612
Everybody
inside the organization

02:45.742 --> 02:49.592
who is supporting Gorbachev.

02:49.632 --> 02:51.202
Why did you leave?

02:53.902 --> 02:55.932
Wasn't for me.

02:55.972 --> 02:59.202
And there was...

03:02.642 --> 03:06.592
There's something rotten
about it.

03:16.272 --> 03:17.742
You have to believe me
when I say

03:17.872 --> 03:20.792
my wife would never do anything
to hurt our country.

03:20.832 --> 03:21.992
If you knew her...

03:22.032 --> 03:25.432
We know how loyal she is.

03:25.472 --> 03:30.132
But that loyalty can be used.

03:30.202 --> 03:33.602
We have to know
what she's been up to,

03:33.672 --> 03:35.272
to figure this out.

03:37.132 --> 03:38.592
The details.

03:47.042 --> 03:49.372
Mostly, what you'd expect.

03:49.512 --> 03:51.102
The Summit.

03:51.142 --> 03:53.392
She's been trying hard
to get, uh,

03:53.392 --> 03:55.662
some kind of radiation sensor.

03:55.732 --> 03:58.162
She went after
an old source of ours,

03:58.232 --> 04:02.002
Lyle Rennhull,
Air Force general.

04:02.072 --> 04:03.732
He ended up dead.

04:14.402 --> 04:17.432
They are following me now.

04:17.432 --> 04:18.872
I was clean tonight,

04:19.002 --> 04:22.372
but, uh, we can't meet in person
again.

04:31.602 --> 04:33.332
Hello?

04:38.242 --> 04:39.902
Elizabeth?

05:30.342 --> 05:33.072
How was work?

05:33.112 --> 05:34.462
Fine.

05:39.182 --> 05:40.902
You want one?

06:12.592 --> 06:14.062
== Synced & corrected by <font color="#00FFFF">MaxPayne</font> ==

09:45.668 --> 09:48.098
- Do you smell that?
- What?

09:48.168 --> 09:49.438
Smoke.

09:51.908 --> 09:54.538
<i> Start the sweep.
Go towards the south. Copy.</i>

09:54.678 --> 09:57.728
They got the lights here, too.
I'll get Eddie.

09:59.328 --> 10:01.428
<i>It's not coming
from the storeroom.</i>

10:01.568 --> 10:02.898
<i>Copy that.</i>

10:03.028 --> 10:04.768
<i>I'm online. Go.</i>

10:22.638 --> 10:24.698
Hey!

10:45.688 --> 10:48.158
Hey,
what's going on in there?

10:48.198 --> 10:50.558
There's someone down here.
In the cages.

10:52.028 --> 10:53.398
<i>Copy that.</i>

10:54.698 --> 10:56.568
<i>Eddie, can you read me?</i>

10:56.698 --> 10:58.968
<i> Eddie?</i>

11:16.238 --> 11:19.118
You check the cages.
I'll check Quality Control.

11:19.258 --> 11:20.588
Gotcha.

11:58.468 --> 12:01.598
Well, thanks for squeezing me
into your calendar.

12:01.598 --> 12:04.738
I'm a popular girl.

12:04.768 --> 12:07.608
Every time I come home,

12:07.608 --> 12:09.628
all my high school friends
want to hang out.

12:09.758 --> 12:11.828
Plus Dad obligations.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.698
How is Michigan treating you?

12:14.828 --> 12:16.198
Hmm?

12:16.268 --> 12:18.128
You still dating that boy?

12:18.268 --> 12:19.468
No, I dumped his ass.

12:19.598 --> 12:21.368
Good.
I didn't like him.

12:21.438 --> 12:23.108
Beer? Coffee?

12:23.108 --> 12:24.908
I just made a pot.
Coffee?

12:24.938 --> 12:28.588
Yeah, I'm, like,
up to ten cups a day now.

12:28.628 --> 12:30.328
Junior year is killing me.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.198
I'll have a beer.

12:32.228 --> 12:35.328
So, what's new in the world
of Jim Baxter?

12:35.398 --> 12:38.668
Just looking for
the next opportunity.

12:38.738 --> 12:39.738
Really?

12:39.738 --> 12:41.308
Yeah.

12:41.378 --> 12:43.758
Would be nice to use my powers
for good.

12:43.788 --> 12:45.088
See the world, maybe.

12:45.228 --> 12:46.628
Do some non-profit work
or something...

12:46.628 --> 12:48.228
I don't know.

12:48.298 --> 12:50.798
I think
you should run away to Fiji

12:50.838 --> 12:53.898
and become a coconut farmer.

12:53.898 --> 12:55.298
I'll consider it.

12:55.438 --> 12:57.638
Guess where I'm going
over Thanksgiving?

12:57.708 --> 12:59.618
Where?
Greece.

12:59.688 --> 13:01.728
With my roommate
and a bunch of girlfriends.

13:01.798 --> 13:04.598
Wow. How's your dad feel
about you missing Thanksgiving?

13:04.628 --> 13:06.258
He's not thrilled.

13:06.328 --> 13:08.128
That's why I came home
this weekend.

13:08.138 --> 13:11.798
But he'll get over it.
Yeah.

13:11.938 --> 13:14.038
So, are you seeing anybody?

13:14.078 --> 13:16.888
Not really.

13:16.888 --> 13:19.088
You're stuck.

13:19.128 --> 13:21.098
I am?

13:21.228 --> 13:22.758
Yeah.

13:22.828 --> 13:25.298
You're too great to be stuck.

13:25.298 --> 13:26.738
You should have the job,

13:26.798 --> 13:29.468
the relationship,
everything you want.

13:29.608 --> 13:32.758
You just gotta seize the day,
you know?

13:35.058 --> 13:36.928
I'm working on it.

13:40.368 --> 13:43.028
When I'm sitting there...
I feel...

13:43.098 --> 13:46.698
I'm into it, but...

13:46.738 --> 13:48.958
are you gonna sleep tonight?

13:51.098 --> 13:52.588
You'll learn to.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.828
Did you get what you needed?

13:59.798 --> 14:01.198
No.

14:03.708 --> 14:05.558
It's like that.

14:05.588 --> 14:07.288
A lot.

14:11.698 --> 14:13.428
I went out
with a bunch of friends

14:13.428 --> 14:15.498
from my Sociology class.

14:15.638 --> 14:17.968
This one guy's brother
came with us.

14:17.968 --> 14:20.238
His name's Brian.
Really cute.

14:20.308 --> 14:22.558
I think he liked me.

14:22.588 --> 14:24.228
That's nice.

14:24.298 --> 14:26.498
He's an intern
for Charles Bennett,

14:26.558 --> 14:28.228
the Congressman from Florida.

14:28.298 --> 14:29.358
He's on the...

14:29.498 --> 14:32.268
Paige?

14:32.398 --> 14:35.198
I saw your car.
What do you need?

14:35.238 --> 14:36.568
Food?

14:36.568 --> 14:38.718
Laundry?

14:38.758 --> 14:41.058
Ah.

14:41.128 --> 14:42.998
Keep going.

14:43.128 --> 14:45.498
Anyway, this guy Brian
is an intern

14:45.528 --> 14:47.828
for a congressman
on the Armed Services Committee.

14:47.838 --> 14:49.838
His brother's birthday
is Friday,

14:49.838 --> 14:51.298
people are meeting up
at this bar...

14:51.368 --> 14:55.108
Right back into it,

14:55.128 --> 14:56.388
is this how it is?

15:00.828 --> 15:02.428
I can go.

15:02.568 --> 15:03.968
We talked about what happened.

15:04.028 --> 15:06.598
It's over.

15:06.668 --> 15:07.998
Really?

15:08.038 --> 15:09.368
It's okay, Dad.

15:09.438 --> 15:11.408
No, I don't think it is.

15:13.188 --> 15:14.588
He was troubled.

15:14.728 --> 15:16.428
He killed himself.

15:16.558 --> 15:19.298
Mom tried to stop him.

15:19.368 --> 15:20.668
Right.

15:23.498 --> 15:27.008
Why did he do that,
do you think?

15:34.298 --> 15:36.298
Why did he kill himself,
Elizabeth?

15:36.328 --> 15:38.398
I'm sure there was a reason.

15:38.438 --> 15:41.298
You'd have to ask him.

15:41.338 --> 15:44.368
Sometimes bad things happen in
the world, and you have to...

15:44.408 --> 15:47.128
Yeah, don't... please don't
tell me about the world, Paige.

15:47.258 --> 15:49.228
Why not?
We live in the world, Philip.

15:49.258 --> 15:51.498
If you guys are gonna fight,
I'm... I'm leaving.

15:51.528 --> 15:53.798
- We're not going to fight.
- No. There's no point.

16:02.258 --> 16:04.388
He loves me.
He loves you.

16:04.428 --> 16:06.758
But somewhere...

16:10.798 --> 16:12.698
something got lost.

16:16.538 --> 16:21.188
This work can get to be
too much for people,

16:21.258 --> 16:23.258
even the best ones.

16:25.098 --> 16:27.298
I'm so proud of you, Paige.

16:28.838 --> 16:30.368
Really proud.

16:43.468 --> 16:45.868
And listen,

16:45.898 --> 16:48.098
forget about this intern...

16:48.138 --> 16:50.238
What? Why?

16:50.368 --> 16:52.658
If you want to date someone,
great.

16:52.728 --> 16:55.628
If you want to go after someone
as a source for information,

16:55.658 --> 16:58.298
when you're ready, great.

16:58.428 --> 17:01.468
But you don't mix
the two things.

17:01.498 --> 17:03.468
Fine.
I-I won't.

17:03.598 --> 17:05.198
And you're not ready
to go after a source.

17:05.338 --> 17:06.738
Not by a long shot.

17:06.808 --> 17:09.258
That takes...

17:09.328 --> 17:11.588
Let's remember the goal.

17:11.627 --> 17:13.528
You're gonna work
in the State Department.

17:13.598 --> 17:16.667
Maybe the CIA.
Maybe the Defense Department.

17:16.798 --> 17:19.127
The most important thing
is to protect you

17:19.137 --> 17:20.998
and to get you ready.

17:38.338 --> 17:41.608
You were out of line,
with Paige.

17:41.738 --> 17:43.988
I'm her father.
We have a deal.

17:44.028 --> 17:47.128
Well...

17:47.198 --> 17:49.668
maybe we need
to renegotiate our deal.

17:52.298 --> 17:54.838
You're happy to have Henry
do whatever you want.

17:54.838 --> 17:56.608
You put her life in danger.

17:56.738 --> 17:58.788
Her life was not in danger.

18:06.728 --> 18:10.338
It won't happen again.

18:10.398 --> 18:12.798
How do you know that?

18:12.838 --> 18:15.238
Because she learns
from her mistakes.

18:24.738 --> 18:26.628
Breland.

18:26.668 --> 18:28.838
Last one before Christmas.

18:32.188 --> 18:35.658
Why? She's, uh... She's not
coming home for Thanksgiving.

18:35.698 --> 18:37.628
She's going to Greece
with her friends.

18:39.368 --> 18:40.568
That's a problem.

18:40.598 --> 18:41.928
We need to hear
what they're saying.

18:41.938 --> 18:43.138
Before the summit.

18:47.878 --> 18:50.528
I'm going downstairs.
Don't wait up.

20:13.786 --> 20:15.216
Mm-hmm.

20:37.556 --> 20:39.926
Latest Breland recording.

20:39.966 --> 20:41.446
Haven't listened
to the whole thing yet,

20:41.516 --> 20:44.976
but the CIA thinks
a General Balashov might resign

20:45.116 --> 20:46.846
because Gorbachev didn't consult him

20:46.986 --> 20:50.156
about a short-range missile deal
in the negotiations.

20:50.286 --> 20:52.256
While they were discussing it,

20:52.286 --> 20:56.456
they kept talking about
"our guy inside"

20:56.526 --> 20:59.976
and how he couldn't get away
right now.

21:00.016 --> 21:02.476
They have a human source.

21:02.516 --> 21:04.486
Sounded like it.

21:04.616 --> 21:07.556
Couldn't tell
if he was here or there.

21:07.586 --> 21:10.256
But could be someone
on the negotiating team.

21:15.846 --> 21:17.776
Something else came up.

21:17.916 --> 21:20.946
You reported that Stan Beeman's
wife talked about a case

21:21.086 --> 21:23.756
he was still working
in Counterintelligence.

21:23.786 --> 21:25.526
It involved a Soviet couple.

21:25.526 --> 21:28.056
Mm-hmm.

21:28.056 --> 21:31.346
One of our couriers went over
to the Americans.

21:31.416 --> 21:34.576
Defected with his wife
and her child.

21:34.616 --> 21:36.586
It could be them.

21:36.616 --> 21:38.486
See if you can find out.

21:38.486 --> 21:41.556
If it is, he has to be dealt with.

21:41.626 --> 21:43.556
Bad enough, a courier.

21:43.626 --> 21:47.096
But this one was a player
on our national hockey team.

21:47.126 --> 21:48.606
After they debrief him,

21:48.616 --> 21:51.076
he'll go right into their
propaganda machine.

21:51.216 --> 21:53.416
Picture him in <i> Time</i> magazine,

21:53.416 --> 21:55.486
talking about how terrible
we are.

22:00.596 --> 22:04.096
What should we do next
with Paige?

22:04.126 --> 22:07.576
Another movie?

22:07.586 --> 22:09.446
Honestly it's...

22:09.516 --> 22:11.286
It's all good.

22:11.356 --> 22:14.516
It's almost like...
going back there myself.

22:21.416 --> 22:22.616
Henry on line three.

22:22.676 --> 22:23.946
Oh.

22:26.486 --> 22:27.746
Hey.

22:27.886 --> 22:29.086
Hey, Dad.
I got a message you called.

22:29.116 --> 22:30.586
What's up?

22:30.656 --> 22:32.586
<i>Oh, yea... not much.
I just hadn't...</i>

22:32.656 --> 22:34.186
Stop! Stop!

22:34.256 --> 22:36.026
W-What?
What happened?

22:36.026 --> 22:38.006
Sorry. Not you.
Stop!

22:40.316 --> 22:41.846
Sorry about that.

22:41.846 --> 22:43.816
Those guys are so annoying.

22:43.886 --> 22:46.016
Okay, what were you saying?

22:46.056 --> 22:48.086
Just hadn't talked in a while.

22:48.156 --> 22:50.156
D-Didn't you guys
have another game?

22:50.196 --> 22:51.626
Uh, no.
This afternoon.

22:51.756 --> 22:53.496
Brockton Moore.

22:53.626 --> 22:55.146
Are... Are they good?

22:55.216 --> 22:57.616
Well, this year, yeah,
but next year...

22:57.746 --> 22:59.286
Coach was telling Jordy
that we're gonna be

22:59.346 --> 23:02.886
the best class
he's had in years.

23:02.986 --> 23:04.586
Wow.

23:04.586 --> 23:07.006
<i>Yeah. We're probably
gonna win League.</i>

23:07.056 --> 23:09.426
<i>Also Jordy thinks
I'm gonna be Captain.</i>

23:09.556 --> 23:11.276
<i>Pretty cool, right?</i>

23:11.416 --> 23:14.276
Oh.

23:14.346 --> 23:15.546
What?

23:17.556 --> 23:19.716
I mean, yes, of course it is.

23:24.656 --> 23:26.126
But what?

23:28.416 --> 23:32.946
There's no easy way to say this,
Henry, but...

23:33.116 --> 23:34.886
we've been having a...

23:34.956 --> 23:38.316
a rough patch at work...

23:38.326 --> 23:41.626
I thought you said
things were looking up.

23:41.626 --> 23:44.296
I know,
but... they're not.

23:47.416 --> 23:48.916
What...
What are you saying?

23:50.986 --> 23:54.756
Look, I know how much
you love St. Edward's. I do too.

23:54.756 --> 23:57.156
And next year

23:57.156 --> 23:59.156
<i>is your senior year and all.</i>

23:59.226 --> 24:01.476
Look, Dad, I-I don't understand
what you're saying.

24:03.786 --> 24:07.216
You know we've expanded
and renovated

24:07.356 --> 24:10.086
and getting new people
and equipment and...

24:10.156 --> 24:12.786
<i>Yeah.</i>

24:12.826 --> 24:16.126
I took out a big loan
to do all that

24:16.156 --> 24:20.546
and then... business
just didn't jump

24:20.616 --> 24:22.416
the way I thought it would.

24:25.256 --> 24:27.086
Oh. Okay.

24:28.956 --> 24:30.286
I'm not sure if...

24:31.756 --> 24:36.276
How we can pay for your tuition
next fall.

24:39.646 --> 24:41.946
<i>Henry?</i>

24:41.956 --> 24:43.956
Yeah.

24:43.956 --> 24:48.256
I mean, I mean, I am trying
to think of ways, but...

24:51.716 --> 24:53.776
<i>Henry?</i>

24:53.916 --> 24:56.116
Yeah, look, I...

24:56.186 --> 24:57.816
I gotta get back to class, Dad.

24:57.816 --> 24:59.886
I'll...
I'll talk to you later.

25:41.436 --> 25:42.936
He's in Room 1203.

25:42.936 --> 25:44.876
We're cycling past
every eight minutes.

25:45.006 --> 25:46.876
Hank just came out.
Julie's next.

25:46.906 --> 25:48.446
Good.

25:50.016 --> 25:51.946
We need to follow an FBI agent.

25:51.986 --> 25:53.396
We're looking for a man

25:53.536 --> 25:55.536
who was probably just moved
into a safehouse.

25:55.666 --> 26:00.006
Soviet. Likely with his wife
and her seven-year-old son.

26:00.076 --> 26:03.836
Hopefully this FBI agent
will lead us there.

26:03.906 --> 26:05.446
He won't be looking
for surveillance,

26:05.446 --> 26:07.096
but we'll have to be
very careful.

26:07.216 --> 26:09.216
I already know
some of his routes.

26:09.246 --> 26:12.566
Don't use Julie on this one,
she's too inexperienced.

26:12.566 --> 26:13.766
That's it.

27:06.676 --> 27:08.976
I said to him, that's great.
You guys want to stay together

27:09.106 --> 27:10.706
after you graduate?
Great.

27:10.846 --> 27:12.646
But you might want
to think twice

27:12.646 --> 27:14.546
about the same apartment thing.

27:14.576 --> 27:16.076
You're
twenty-one years old.

27:16.136 --> 27:18.166
You have no idea.

27:18.236 --> 27:22.006
I just... I just want him
to have a life.

27:22.006 --> 27:23.536
He listen?

27:23.676 --> 27:25.276
What do you think?

27:30.616 --> 27:33.366
You ever worry about money?

27:33.396 --> 27:35.166
I got a government job.

27:35.236 --> 27:36.836
No alimony.

27:36.966 --> 27:40.036
They match whatever I put
into my retirement account.

27:40.176 --> 27:44.036
Wow. And I'm not taking trips
to Europe every year...

27:44.076 --> 27:45.446
sorry...
Yeah.

27:45.546 --> 27:48.546
But we don't have
any big problems.

27:48.586 --> 27:50.196
Why?
Is everything okay?

27:50.196 --> 27:51.996
Yeah, yeah.

27:52.136 --> 27:53.536
I don't know.

27:53.606 --> 27:54.966
It's just in business,

27:54.966 --> 27:57.936
there's always
this pressure about growth,

27:57.976 --> 27:59.876
that if you're not growing,
you're not succeeding.

27:59.876 --> 28:01.676
Yeah.
But why?

28:01.806 --> 28:04.616
When you think about it, what is
so bad about staying the same?

28:04.646 --> 28:07.266
Not taking on
more responsibilities,

28:07.396 --> 28:10.396
more headaches, more time.

28:10.406 --> 28:12.936
Bills keep coming either way.

28:12.936 --> 28:14.606
I think of what my father
told me:

28:14.636 --> 28:17.006
The more you want,
the more you get.

28:17.046 --> 28:19.306
And that's both good and bad.

28:19.376 --> 28:20.706
Yeah.

29:41.606 --> 29:43.476
You rich yet?

29:43.476 --> 29:45.146
I wish.

29:46.336 --> 29:50.536
Actually... it's not good, Elizabeth.

29:50.606 --> 29:51.666
How bad is it?

29:51.806 --> 29:52.866
It's bad.

29:53.006 --> 29:57.346
It's just not adding up.

29:57.346 --> 29:59.606
Maybe I moved too fast.

29:59.616 --> 30:02.576
The expansion...
the extra people...

30:02.716 --> 30:06.766
I know.
I keep forgetting their names...

30:06.766 --> 30:09.606
maybe you just need to cut back.

30:09.636 --> 30:12.676
Yeah.

30:12.806 --> 30:15.906
I just don't see
how cutting back would fix it.

30:18.686 --> 30:20.496
You'll figure it out.

30:22.196 --> 30:26.936
I'm trying... but I'm, uh...
I'm not sure.

30:27.006 --> 30:30.676
I told Henry that I'm not sure

30:30.746 --> 30:35.246
we can pay his tuition
next year.

30:35.286 --> 30:36.596
Really.

30:39.706 --> 30:41.406
How did that go?

30:45.776 --> 30:48.576
I don't know.

30:57.536 --> 30:59.266
Well.

31:03.876 --> 31:05.776
He's your department.

31:28.736 --> 31:31.606
How's Paige?

31:31.666 --> 31:33.306
She's fine.

31:35.136 --> 31:37.476
You know,
you can ask her yourself.

31:37.476 --> 31:40.506
I'm not keeping her from you.

31:40.516 --> 31:42.676
I know.

31:52.876 --> 31:55.306
What about you?

31:55.346 --> 31:56.876
What?

32:10.606 --> 32:12.846
I'm tired.

32:12.976 --> 32:14.976
All the time.

32:46.976 --> 32:50.246
<i>put pressure on the city
to revoke the club's license.</i>

32:50.246 --> 32:51.776
<i>Once a mainstay of D.C. nightlife...</i>

33:21.790 --> 33:25.830
I looked at some of your
paintings in the basement.

33:25.830 --> 33:29.220
I liked the one of the woman
in the kitchen...

33:29.330 --> 33:31.600
with the broken eggs?

33:31.768 --> 33:33.228
That's my least favorite.

33:34.918 --> 33:37.288
Why?

33:37.318 --> 33:39.018
Too sentimental.

33:45.928 --> 33:48.758
When I first got sick...

33:48.828 --> 33:50.298
when I found out about it...

33:50.338 --> 33:55.958
I kept thinking, well, okay,

33:55.958 --> 33:58.958
at least I've got the work,

33:58.988 --> 34:01.288
it'll be there forever,

34:01.358 --> 34:04.598
it's the best of me.

34:04.598 --> 34:06.798
Something to leave behind.

34:10.358 --> 34:14.188
But really... who cares?
Who cares?

34:14.328 --> 34:16.888
All those hours just...

34:21.668 --> 34:25.018
Honestly, I wish I'd spent them with Glenn,

34:25.018 --> 34:28.547
just being with him,

34:28.688 --> 34:30.688
doing I don't know what.
Just...

34:34.027 --> 34:35.598
Doesn't matter...

34:42.618 --> 34:44.288
Sit.

34:51.358 --> 34:53.828
Hello?

34:53.828 --> 34:55.228
Oh, hey, Martin.

34:56.768 --> 34:58.518
Try the vase.

35:11.528 --> 35:13.528
You got a...
You got a strong stroke.

35:14.988 --> 35:17.048
It's terrible.

35:17.088 --> 35:18.648
No, it's just flat.

35:18.788 --> 35:22.418
Well, it is a piece of paper.

35:22.558 --> 35:25.528
You see how the light hits
the vase?

35:25.658 --> 35:27.528
Yeah.

35:27.568 --> 35:30.068
Good.
Don't touch that.

35:30.198 --> 35:33.748
Everything else,
make a little bit darker.

35:33.788 --> 35:37.018
And don't be afraid to use
your fingers to smudge it.

35:39.758 --> 35:41.958
Keep working.

35:41.958 --> 35:44.928
Start from the dark,
work towards the light.

35:53.088 --> 35:55.088
Who was on the phone?

35:55.088 --> 35:57.788
- You know Martin Gurrin.
- Yeah.

35:57.828 --> 36:00.658
Some of the guys are gonna watch
the World Series

36:00.728 --> 36:04.268
at his house tomorrow,
with one of the Russians.

36:04.338 --> 36:06.688
Well, you should go.

36:06.718 --> 36:08.288
I don't know...

36:08.318 --> 36:11.088
I don't really want to watch
the game without you.

36:11.128 --> 36:13.688
Oh, I've lost interest in baseball.

36:13.758 --> 36:15.798
I can't believe
I ever liked baseball.

36:18.398 --> 36:20.028
I could take you.

36:23.318 --> 36:25.488
A party's still a party.

36:28.688 --> 36:31.458
No one wants to see someone
like this.

36:31.528 --> 36:33.328
Don't say that.

36:33.398 --> 36:36.468
I've taken sicker people places.

36:36.498 --> 36:37.728
You know, I'd be there,

36:37.848 --> 36:39.718
have your wheelchair,
your meds...

36:39.718 --> 36:42.188
Oh, you make it sound fabulous.

36:42.218 --> 36:45.458
Maybe you should get out, honey.

36:45.458 --> 36:47.588
Yeah.
For the last time?

36:50.498 --> 36:53.098
I think it'd be good
for everyone:

36:53.128 --> 36:55.578
Change of scenery,
little baseball...

37:09.068 --> 37:11.128
This about the fur coat?

37:11.168 --> 37:13.448
Nope.
Conrad Monts.

37:13.448 --> 37:15.518
Monts...
Monts...

37:15.558 --> 37:18.888
Yeah, the guy trying to build the
air rights complex over I-375.

37:18.888 --> 37:21.128
Yeah, I was gonna push through
wiretaps on Clyburn.

37:21.258 --> 37:23.358
You think we should hold off,
ask for both these guys at once?

37:23.528 --> 37:26.228
Well, in my opinion, yeah. But
have a look, see for yourself.

37:26.228 --> 37:28.378
See, the thing we're gonna have to
deal with...

37:28.418 --> 37:30.048
Beeman.

37:30.048 --> 37:33.318
Yeah.

37:33.458 --> 37:34.858
Sure.

37:34.858 --> 37:36.388
I'll be right down.

37:42.468 --> 37:45.248
We went up again on Burov
yesterday.

37:45.288 --> 37:47.048
Goes to the school, eats out,

37:47.058 --> 37:49.088
then goes back to his hotel.

37:49.218 --> 37:50.958
How long are you gonna stay
on him?

37:51.088 --> 37:52.628
Another twenty-four.

37:52.688 --> 37:55.088
I told you we're stretched thin.

37:55.228 --> 37:57.558
Well, you'd have
to get pretty lucky.

37:57.628 --> 38:00.598
I'm trying to keep some guys
on him a couple times a week.

38:01.618 --> 38:07.518
So, Mr. and Mrs. Teacup
are giving everybody a headache.

38:07.588 --> 38:11.228
Relocation just called.
They want us back in there.

38:11.298 --> 38:13.598
What?
They can't do their job?

38:13.598 --> 38:15.928
Both of them keep saying
they need you.

38:16.028 --> 38:17.328
Jesus Christ, Dennis.

38:17.398 --> 38:20.418
I'm done babysitting
those lunatics.

38:20.458 --> 38:23.088
I... I've done everything
I can.

38:23.218 --> 38:26.888
Relocation doesn't complain
a lot.

38:26.958 --> 38:28.758
Let's help them out.

38:28.758 --> 38:30.358
See what the problems are

38:30.368 --> 38:31.958
and check in on them
every couple of days

38:32.028 --> 38:33.328
until they go.

38:37.488 --> 38:39.858
You got no one
who can take this over?

38:39.988 --> 38:41.788
Would I be asking?

42:29.990 --> 42:32.120
You want to just...
You want to hang on to the rail?

42:32.160 --> 42:33.760
There you go.

42:33.890 --> 42:35.990
All right, real slow.

42:36.030 --> 42:37.700
There you go.
Yeah.

42:39.950 --> 42:42.220
Okay. Now just turn around
and hang on to me.

42:42.250 --> 42:43.620
I'll let you down slow, okay?

42:43.690 --> 42:45.820
Nice and slow.

42:45.960 --> 42:47.190
Okay?
Yeah.

42:47.260 --> 42:48.590
I wouldn't describe it that way.

42:48.730 --> 42:50.560
I'll be with you the whole time.

42:50.690 --> 42:52.430
<i> ...to the
Minnesota Twin Cities</i>

42:52.560 --> 42:55.080
<i>of Minneapolis and St. Paul for game 6</i>

42:55.180 --> 42:57.420
<i>between the visiting St. Louis Cardinals</i>

42:57.420 --> 42:59.320
<i>and the Minnesota Twins,</i>

42:59.450 --> 43:02.920
<i>on this cold, cloudy day where
the temperature's in the 30s.</i>

43:03.060 --> 43:04.860
Uh, why are they Twins?

43:04.930 --> 43:07.130
Twin Cities.

43:07.130 --> 43:08.590
Uh, yeah, in the state
of Minnesota,

43:08.660 --> 43:10.830
the cities of, uh, Minneapolis
and St. Paul

43:10.830 --> 43:13.620
are so close together,
they function as one big city.

43:13.680 --> 43:15.150
Oh.

43:15.190 --> 43:18.150
And when they... start
to play?

43:18.160 --> 43:21.660
Uh, in about fifteen minutes
or so.

43:21.690 --> 43:23.490
Could I get...
Can I have some water?

43:23.630 --> 43:24.630
Sure.

43:25.900 --> 43:28.160
<i>Twins fans have packed The Dome...
</i> Excuse me.

43:28.180 --> 43:31.520
<i>And are making themselves</i>
<i>heard...</i>

43:31.520 --> 43:32.850
Hey.

43:32.850 --> 43:34.390
You okay?

43:36.920 --> 43:39.590
Can I make
you a plate or something?

43:39.730 --> 43:43.060
Go.
Save the world.

43:43.200 --> 43:44.980
We're fine here.
Really.

43:47.490 --> 43:48.880
Okay.

43:51.720 --> 43:53.920
Love you.

43:59.360 --> 44:01.230
I shouldn't have come.

44:01.270 --> 44:03.220
No. It's... It's good
to be out.

44:03.350 --> 44:05.520
Yeah, maybe for you.

44:05.520 --> 44:07.520
<i>But he did pitch very well</i>

44:07.520 --> 44:09.660
<i>against the Cardinals in Game 3.</i>

44:09.720 --> 44:12.730
<i>The one thing to remember</i>
<i>is that the Minnesota Twins</i>

44:12.730 --> 44:15.460
<i>are gonna be playing this game</i>
<i>today like it's Game Seven</i>

44:15.630 --> 44:17.430
<i>because if they lose</i>
<i>this ball game,</i>

44:17.470 --> 44:20.220
<i>they will be going home</i>
<i>and have a long winter.</i>

44:20.320 --> 44:22.020
<i>For that reason</i>
<i>I think Les Straker</i>

44:22.090 --> 44:24.020
<i>will be pulled early</i>
<i>if he gets into trouble.</i>

44:24.090 --> 44:26.660
<i>We might even see Reardon,</i>
<i>their ace reliever...</i>

44:26.720 --> 44:28.890
Do you need anything?

44:28.890 --> 44:32.090
Martin tells me
you're an artist?

44:32.160 --> 44:33.500
I was.

44:33.630 --> 44:35.210
You still are.

44:35.350 --> 44:37.780
I-I'd love to see
some of your work some time.

44:40.120 --> 44:41.920
Uh, I have to check
on the kitchen.

44:41.920 --> 44:43.860
<i>Then the Cardinals came back</i>
<i>and used their speed</i>

44:43.890 --> 44:46.390
<i>at home to take</i>
<i>the lead in the series.</i>

44:46.530 --> 44:47.930
<i>It would seem that the Twins</i>

44:47.930 --> 44:49.260
<i>would have the major</i>
<i>advantage...</i>

44:49.330 --> 44:51.260
I don't feel good.

44:51.330 --> 44:53.120
What?

44:53.120 --> 44:55.850
Okay, okay, okay.

44:55.890 --> 44:57.920
Oh, God...

44:57.990 --> 44:59.250
Oh, shit!
Okay, okay.

44:59.260 --> 45:00.790
Hold on.
Let me grab something.

45:00.920 --> 45:02.490
Hey, no, I'm here...
I'm here... I'm here.

45:02.630 --> 45:03.890
Okay. I'm here.
I'm here. It's okay.

45:03.890 --> 45:05.390
Don't worry.
I'll get some towels.

45:05.530 --> 45:06.730
Thank you.

45:06.860 --> 45:09.110
It's okay. Babe, you're okay.
You're okay.

45:09.150 --> 45:10.280
What am I doing here?

45:10.320 --> 45:12.020
We're gonna get you home.

45:18.530 --> 45:20.330
Okay.

45:20.390 --> 45:22.730
Uh, I-I can help.

45:22.730 --> 45:24.060
Uh...

45:24.070 --> 45:25.850
Okay. Shh. Okay.

45:25.880 --> 45:29.120
Why am I here?
It's okay, baby.

45:29.190 --> 45:31.920
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

45:31.990 --> 45:32.990
It's okay.

45:33.060 --> 45:34.360
It's okay, baby.

45:34.390 --> 45:35.960
We're gonna get you home.
Okay?

45:35.990 --> 45:37.630
Okay.

45:37.700 --> 45:39.400
It's okay.

45:39.530 --> 45:41.530
<i>I just wanted to say...</i>

45:41.570 --> 45:42.880
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

45:42.880 --> 45:45.220
<i>About your wife.</i>

45:45.350 --> 45:46.990
<i>Um, it must be very hard.</i>

45:47.050 --> 45:49.450
<i> Yes.
Thanks.</i>

45:49.490 --> 45:53.390
<i>I had an idea earlier in
the pizza restaurant.</i>

45:53.390 --> 45:58.130
<i>From what you were saying.
It's a very hard thing.</i>

45:58.270 --> 46:00.720
<i>Thanks.</i>

46:00.790 --> 46:03.790
<i>I imagine it's hard to
concentrate on our work.</i>

46:03.790 --> 46:06.650
<i>With... With this going on.</i>

46:06.710 --> 46:09.290
<i>Sometimes. But other times,</i>

46:09.430 --> 46:11.390
<i>it feels like it might...</i>

46:11.530 --> 46:13.260
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

46:13.400 --> 46:16.180
<i>Hey, no, I'm here... I'm here...
I'm here.</i>
