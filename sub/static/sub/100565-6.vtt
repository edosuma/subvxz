WEBVTT

00:01.349 --> 00:04.004
The ERA is not about,
uh, equality.

00:05.701 --> 00:06.745
It's about power.

00:06.789 --> 00:08.791
There are more of us
than there are of you.

00:09.966 --> 00:11.359
I wouldn't be so sure.

02:21.489 --> 02:23.447
-Here you go, my man.
-Thank you, sir.

02:23.491 --> 02:25.188
-You have a good one.

02:30.585 --> 02:32.239
Ah.

03:05.315 --> 03:06.969
Hey, Stewart.

03:11.495 --> 03:13.454
Lyndon, what the fuck?

03:13.497 --> 03:15.107
You scared the shit out of me.

03:15.151 --> 03:16.587
Sorry.

03:16.631 --> 03:18.285
How'd you get in?

03:19.851 --> 03:21.462
Did you bust it?

03:23.507 --> 03:25.379
I don't know, maybe.

03:25.422 --> 03:28.382
If I did,
I'll buy you a new one.

03:28.425 --> 03:30.471
I can buy you a whole new home
if you'd like.

03:30.514 --> 03:32.516
I don't want a new home.

03:37.869 --> 03:39.828
I need to talk to you.

03:39.871 --> 03:41.612
You're not allowed
to talk to me.

03:41.656 --> 03:44.267
No one saw me get here.
They don't know where I am.

03:44.311 --> 03:47.488
I bought a flight to L.A.,
left all my hardware

03:47.531 --> 03:50.099
and then hitched back up.

03:50.142 --> 03:51.883
Hitched.

03:51.927 --> 03:53.929
Jesus.

03:59.717 --> 04:01.371
You scared?

04:02.720 --> 04:04.331
You want me to go?

04:04.374 --> 04:07.377
I'm not scared for myself,
Lyndon.

04:14.341 --> 04:16.691
What did you want to talk about?

04:18.954 --> 04:20.912
I want you to speak to them.

04:20.956 --> 04:23.437
Or speak to Forest
and smooth it out.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.482
Smooth it out?

04:27.615 --> 04:29.834
Get me back into Devs.

04:32.620 --> 04:35.405
I don't think that's happening.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.240
That's my fucking life's work
in there.

04:44.284 --> 04:47.025
-Lyndon, you're 19 years old.
-No, I can't walk away.

04:47.069 --> 04:49.898
Einstein was 26 when he told usabout relativity.

04:49.941 --> 04:51.682
-You still got a bit of time.
-But I have to be there.

04:51.726 --> 04:54.032
I'm the guy
who cracked the problem.

04:54.076 --> 04:55.947
On a Many-Worlds principle.

04:55.991 --> 04:58.210
Yes, exactly.
And it worked, beautifully.

04:58.254 --> 04:59.908
So what's the implication
of that?

04:59.951 --> 05:03.128
He doesn't want Many-Worlds.
Just one.

05:03.172 --> 05:05.130
But there is no "just one."
That's the point.

05:05.174 --> 05:06.697
If he doesn't like it,

05:06.741 --> 05:09.352
he's got to change the laws
of the fucking universe.

05:09.396 --> 05:12.050
He's a tech genius.
Those laws are secondary.

05:12.094 --> 05:15.358
He's not a fucking genius,
Stewart.

05:15.402 --> 05:17.404
He's an entrepreneur.

05:18.753 --> 05:21.190
And he's crazy.

05:21.233 --> 05:23.584
He's obsessive.
He kills people.

05:26.891 --> 05:28.893
And he's trying
to resurrect his daughter.

05:34.551 --> 05:36.553
Just fucking ask yourself...

05:38.512 --> 05:40.470
...do you really want somethingas powerful as Devs

05:40.514 --> 05:42.516
in the hands of someone crazy?

07:06.904 --> 07:09.907
What... What's going on?

07:11.866 --> 07:13.737
-What the fuck is going on?
-Lily.

07:13.781 --> 07:15.478
-Where am I?
-It's-it's okay.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.480
-You're safe. We're in a motel.-What?

07:17.524 --> 07:19.308
We're in a motel.

07:19.351 --> 07:22.180
I didn't know where else to go,so I brought you here.

07:22.224 --> 07:24.487
Y-You brought me to a m-motel?

07:24.531 --> 07:26.141
From the hospital.

07:26.184 --> 07:28.143
You were in a hospital.

07:28.186 --> 07:29.492
They put you there.

07:29.536 --> 07:31.538
The police, a doctor.

07:43.767 --> 07:45.465
The hospital.

07:49.817 --> 07:51.775
You came to get me.

07:51.819 --> 07:53.516
You got me out.

07:56.954 --> 07:58.913
Chivalry.

07:58.956 --> 08:00.915
Yeah.

08:00.958 --> 08:02.960
Thank you.

08:04.832 --> 08:07.661
You were, uh, seriously wasted.

08:07.704 --> 08:09.314
I don't know
what they gave you--

08:09.358 --> 08:10.664
some heavy fucking meds--

08:10.707 --> 08:13.710
but you've been sleeping it offfor hours now.

08:15.930 --> 08:18.933
I brought you some clothes.

08:28.812 --> 08:30.771
Jesus.

08:30.814 --> 08:32.816
I feel sick.

08:33.861 --> 08:36.254
My mouth...

08:36.298 --> 08:38.300
tastes like metal.

08:45.220 --> 08:47.570
What happened to your hand?

08:48.745 --> 08:50.355
Nothing.

08:50.399 --> 08:52.401
I just hurt it
while I was getting you out.

09:20.081 --> 09:21.822
Where are we?

09:21.865 --> 09:23.258
Napa.

09:23.301 --> 09:25.260
I would have driven further,
but I didn't think

09:25.303 --> 09:28.002
anyone would find us here.

09:28.045 --> 09:29.873
And I wasn't really sure

09:29.917 --> 09:31.875
if the cops
would be looking for my car

09:31.919 --> 09:34.486
or where the hell
we should be heading.

09:34.530 --> 09:37.533
Holy fucking Christ.

09:42.669 --> 09:44.845
What are we gonna do?

09:44.888 --> 09:46.847
Okay, so I was thinking

09:46.890 --> 09:49.066
maybe now we go to the media.

09:49.110 --> 09:51.068
The press.
Something like that.

09:51.112 --> 09:53.636
We're telling them
an escaped psychiatric patient

09:53.680 --> 09:57.074
has secret information
about a murder conspiracy.

09:58.859 --> 10:00.861
No one's gonna listen, Jamie.

10:04.516 --> 10:06.475
Then we run.

10:06.518 --> 10:08.825
We can't use a credit card.

10:08.869 --> 10:10.827
Jus... We can't buy gas.

10:10.871 --> 10:12.873
We can't use a phone.

10:14.309 --> 10:16.311
Do you have any cash?

10:17.355 --> 10:19.923
Uh, 40 bucks.

10:19.967 --> 10:22.970
Then we aren't
gonna be running far.

10:33.110 --> 10:35.069
Do we have enough gas
to drive back

10:35.112 --> 10:37.898
into San Francisco?

10:37.941 --> 10:39.508
Yeah.

10:40.857 --> 10:42.859
Then I know where I'm gonna go.

10:44.948 --> 10:47.951
But you don't have
to come with me, Jamie.

10:47.995 --> 10:49.736
Seriously?

10:49.779 --> 10:51.738
Yes, I'm serious.

10:51.781 --> 10:53.783
I can do this on my own.

10:55.437 --> 10:56.917
Okay, Lily.
Yeah, that's...

10:56.960 --> 10:58.483
that's totally cool, I'll just

10:58.527 --> 11:01.051
hang out here
and watch cartoons.

11:01.095 --> 11:04.098
You want to text me
when you're done?

12:00.458 --> 12:01.764
He's here.

12:01.808 --> 12:03.461
That's his car.

12:05.420 --> 12:08.162
Lily, you really gonna do this?

12:08.205 --> 12:10.730
We could at least
wait until he gets up.

12:30.706 --> 12:32.664
It's her.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.710
She's here.

12:44.459 --> 12:46.461
I think
I heard something inside.

13:02.042 --> 13:03.695
Come in.

13:18.232 --> 13:20.234
Can I get you a drink?

13:21.713 --> 13:24.281
Think I've got some juice,

13:24.325 --> 13:25.979
uh...

13:27.241 --> 13:30.244
...beer, milk, or there's water.

13:32.986 --> 13:34.335
I'll take some water.

13:36.946 --> 13:38.600
Okay.

13:40.384 --> 13:42.038
How about you?

13:43.126 --> 13:44.824
Sorry, I don't know your name.

13:47.565 --> 13:48.958
Jamie.

13:49.002 --> 13:50.525
You work for me?

13:50.568 --> 13:52.483
No.

13:54.355 --> 13:56.009
I'm good.

14:22.122 --> 14:24.080
Lily wants to talk.

14:24.124 --> 14:25.734
Right.

14:25.777 --> 14:27.170
Why don't you let me do that.

14:27.214 --> 14:30.173
-I-I came here to talk to him.
-If you came

14:30.217 --> 14:32.915
for answers,
you should talk to me.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.353
Maybe alone.

14:36.397 --> 14:38.181
Yeah.

14:38.225 --> 14:39.487
Come on, Jamie.

14:39.530 --> 14:41.532
We're being thrown out.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.362
It's a nice evening.
We'll sit outside.

14:51.020 --> 14:53.153
Don't worry.
She'll be fine.

15:11.780 --> 15:13.129
Let's sit down.

15:47.294 --> 15:48.991
What happened to your hand
there-- you hurt it?

15:52.038 --> 15:53.996
You fucking kidding me?

15:54.040 --> 15:56.042
Is that supposed to be a joke?

15:57.304 --> 15:59.480
No.
Not a joke.

15:59.523 --> 16:01.134
What do you mean?

16:01.177 --> 16:02.874
Your, uh...

16:02.918 --> 16:05.181
attack dog, Kenton,

16:05.225 --> 16:07.183
broke into my apartment,

16:07.227 --> 16:09.185
half-drowned me
in my own bathtub

16:09.229 --> 16:13.059
and then bent back my finger
until it snapped.

16:15.409 --> 16:18.151
Jesus Christ.

16:18.194 --> 16:20.370
You're telling me
you didn't know?

16:20.414 --> 16:24.113
I knew he'd intimidated
one of Lily's friends.

16:25.854 --> 16:27.812
I didn't know it was you.

16:27.856 --> 16:31.251
And I didn't know he'd...
broken your hand.

16:31.294 --> 16:33.253
Yeah, well...

16:33.296 --> 16:34.950
I'm very sorry.

16:39.476 --> 16:41.435
It's not that I want
these things to happen

16:41.478 --> 16:43.089
or intend them to happen.

16:43.132 --> 16:45.134
You just let them happen.

16:45.178 --> 16:47.528
You observe from the sidelines.

16:48.746 --> 16:50.748
Yeah, in a way.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.884
I don't understand
why I'm not talking to Forest.

16:58.365 --> 17:00.323
I don't think
you can answer my questions.

17:00.367 --> 17:01.977
I can.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.326
Who are you?

17:03.370 --> 17:04.980
Katie.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.373
Not your name.

17:08.462 --> 17:10.420
I work at Amaya.

17:10.464 --> 17:13.075
I'm the chief designer
of the Devs system.

17:13.119 --> 17:15.947
You're Forest's girlfriend.

17:15.991 --> 17:17.514
Girlfriend.

17:19.473 --> 17:21.214
Yeah.

17:21.257 --> 17:23.433
I guess I'm his girlfriend.

17:23.477 --> 17:25.696
Not sure the word
totally works for me, but...

17:25.740 --> 17:27.089
whatever.

17:31.398 --> 17:33.356
Is there a judgment?

17:33.400 --> 17:35.402
Sleeping with the boss?

17:37.056 --> 17:39.014
He's vulnerable.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.016
Needs someone.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.496
I like it being me.

17:42.539 --> 17:46.195
I don't give a fuck
who you're sleeping with.

17:49.285 --> 17:51.244
I have other things on my mind.

17:51.287 --> 17:53.289
Fair enough.

17:56.510 --> 17:58.468
Did you know Sergei?

17:58.512 --> 18:00.340
Your boyfriend.

18:00.383 --> 18:02.298
Did you know him?

18:04.561 --> 18:06.520
We had met.

18:06.563 --> 18:08.087
Briefly.

18:10.437 --> 18:12.352
What happened to him?

18:12.395 --> 18:14.354
You know what happened to him.

18:14.397 --> 18:16.356
I want you to tell me.

18:16.399 --> 18:19.359
On his first day at Devs,

18:19.402 --> 18:23.145
he tried to steal some ofthe source code of the project.

18:23.189 --> 18:25.191
He was caught
when he tried to leave.

18:27.018 --> 18:28.368
So they killed him.

18:35.462 --> 18:37.203
They?

18:37.246 --> 18:38.552
They.

18:38.595 --> 18:40.206
Us.

18:40.249 --> 18:41.598
Me.

18:42.686 --> 18:44.427
I'm not trying to evade you.

18:44.471 --> 18:47.082
I want to know who killed him.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.779
Kenton.

18:48.823 --> 18:50.825
If you mean the person
who actually did it.

18:59.094 --> 19:00.400
How?

19:00.443 --> 19:03.011
You want to know how he died?

19:04.360 --> 19:06.014
The means of it?

19:09.887 --> 19:11.237
Does it matter?

19:14.283 --> 19:16.285
He didn't burn to death.

19:17.504 --> 19:19.158
No.

19:22.248 --> 19:23.988
Then it was covered up.

19:24.032 --> 19:25.164
Yes.

19:27.862 --> 19:29.820
Made to look like suicide.

19:29.864 --> 19:31.257
Yes.

19:32.301 --> 19:34.303
But you know all this, Lily.

19:35.391 --> 19:36.740
Don't you?

19:39.526 --> 19:41.136
Yes.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.443
Then ask me what you don't know.

19:56.064 --> 19:58.066
What is Devs?

19:59.110 --> 20:00.634
Right.

20:05.421 --> 20:06.901
That.

20:10.121 --> 20:12.080
I've got a feeling

20:12.123 --> 20:14.865
we're gonna be
stuck out here a while.

20:16.737 --> 20:18.695
We can sit here
in silence if you want.

20:18.739 --> 20:20.741
That's totally cool.

20:22.351 --> 20:25.311
But the time will probably
go quicker

20:25.354 --> 20:27.008
if we talk.

20:28.662 --> 20:30.664
Why don't you tell me
your story?

20:32.361 --> 20:33.710
You work in tech?

20:40.413 --> 20:42.371
Yeah, web security.

20:42.415 --> 20:44.373
Where?

20:44.417 --> 20:46.375
David Wallace.

20:46.419 --> 20:48.116
Oh, yeah.
I know those guys.

20:48.159 --> 20:49.509
Good outfit.

20:51.380 --> 20:54.383
You offense or defense?

20:56.907 --> 20:58.518
Uh, defense.

20:58.561 --> 21:00.520
You look like defense.

21:00.563 --> 21:02.261
And you're a friend of Lily's.

21:03.827 --> 21:05.481
Yeah.

21:08.441 --> 21:11.444
She's had it hardthe last few days, I know that.

21:13.837 --> 21:15.491
Fuck off.

21:17.624 --> 21:19.887
Look, I'll do the small talk
if it gets us through

21:19.930 --> 21:22.411
the fucking weirdness
of the situation, but...

21:24.283 --> 21:26.241
...saying that Lily's
had it hard

21:26.285 --> 21:28.287
the last couple of days...

21:29.766 --> 21:33.161
No, that's too much
of an understatement.

21:34.205 --> 21:36.207
I take your point.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.298
It's good you stick up for her.

21:42.605 --> 21:45.304
Yeah, Lily's pretty capable
of sticking up for herself.

21:46.957 --> 21:48.916
Yeah.

21:48.959 --> 21:51.440
I see that.

21:51.484 --> 21:54.617
Does anything ever happen
without a reason?

21:54.661 --> 21:56.619
What are you talking about?

21:56.663 --> 21:59.405
You want to know
what happens at Devs.

21:59.448 --> 22:01.407
I'll tell you.

22:01.450 --> 22:03.583
But I need to do it
by asking you questions.

22:03.626 --> 22:05.236
I'm not here to play games.

22:05.280 --> 22:06.716
It's not a game.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.327
It's a way of explaining.

22:09.763 --> 22:12.766
-Go with it.
-Go with it?

22:12.809 --> 22:14.245
Yes.

22:14.289 --> 22:16.465
Go with it.

22:16.509 --> 22:18.511
Okay?

22:25.866 --> 22:27.520
Okay.

22:27.563 --> 22:29.086
So...

22:31.306 --> 22:34.265
...does anything ever happen
without a reason?

22:34.309 --> 22:35.789
Yes.

22:35.832 --> 22:37.791
No.

22:39.923 --> 22:42.535
Things happen without a reason.

22:42.578 --> 22:44.406
-Like?
-An example?

22:44.450 --> 22:46.495
Yes.

22:49.280 --> 22:51.544
A kid getting leukemia?

22:51.587 --> 22:53.328
Getting hit by lightning?

22:55.330 --> 22:57.114
It's an endless list.

22:57.158 --> 23:00.117
No, Lily.

23:00.161 --> 23:01.641
I didn't ask
if things ever happen

23:01.684 --> 23:03.033
without a good reason.

23:03.077 --> 23:04.600
I said areason.

23:06.080 --> 23:09.562
The leukemia was an aberration
in the kid's DNA.

23:09.605 --> 23:12.347
The lightning
was a static discharge.

23:27.101 --> 23:28.755
Why did the pen roll
across the table?

23:31.497 --> 23:32.802
You pushed it.

23:32.846 --> 23:34.500
Why did I push it?

23:35.979 --> 23:38.068
I'm guessing to make a point.

23:38.112 --> 23:40.070
That's a reason.

23:40.114 --> 23:42.421
It's why the pen
rolled across the table.

23:47.295 --> 23:49.253
You blinked.

23:49.297 --> 23:50.472
What?

23:50.516 --> 23:52.431
Why did you just blink?

23:54.084 --> 23:56.086
Your eyes were dry.

23:57.740 --> 23:59.525
Or you were nervous.

24:01.004 --> 24:03.529
Does anything ever happen
without a reason?

24:04.791 --> 24:06.793
There must be some events.

24:08.795 --> 24:10.405
Random events.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.973
Name a random event.

24:13.016 --> 24:15.018
Take a moment.
Think about it.

24:16.367 --> 24:18.718
And then name one.

24:21.329 --> 24:23.200
A coin flip.

24:23.244 --> 24:25.507
A coin flip
is not a random event.

24:25.551 --> 24:27.553
It's a complex event.

24:29.032 --> 24:31.034
How hard was the coin flipped?

24:32.122 --> 24:34.647
What was the weight of the coin?

24:34.690 --> 24:36.344
The air resistance?

24:37.476 --> 24:39.434
The temperature of the room?

24:39.478 --> 24:41.088
The angle it landed
on the table?

24:41.131 --> 24:43.917
Okay, not a coin flip.

24:43.960 --> 24:45.919
But some things are random.

24:45.962 --> 24:47.616
Then name one.

24:49.052 --> 24:51.359
-Selection.
-Selection of what?

24:51.402 --> 24:53.535
Selecting from things
that are all the same.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.537
What things are all the same?

24:55.581 --> 24:56.973
Objects.

24:57.017 --> 24:59.628
Identical copies of a book
at a bookstore.

24:59.672 --> 25:02.544
You chose the one
beneath the top of the pile

25:02.588 --> 25:04.372
because it had been
handled less.

25:09.072 --> 25:11.684
Meteors landing.

25:11.727 --> 25:13.686
Roulette wheels spinning.

25:13.729 --> 25:15.731
Misfortunes suffered.

25:16.645 --> 25:18.647
They can all be unraveled.

25:20.867 --> 25:23.609
You can't name a random event.

25:23.652 --> 25:26.960
Because there are
no random events.

25:32.966 --> 25:36.622
You ask... what is Devs?

25:39.233 --> 25:41.191
This is Devs.

25:41.235 --> 25:44.194
This is the only principle
you need to understand.

25:44.238 --> 25:47.197
Nothing ever happens
without a reason.

25:47.241 --> 25:50.244
Everything was determined
by something prior.

25:53.987 --> 25:55.989
That's it.

25:57.991 --> 26:01.647
Now, take a computer.

26:02.691 --> 26:04.432
Give it all the data
that can exist

26:04.475 --> 26:07.174
about this pen
rolling across the table.

26:07.217 --> 26:09.959
Its trajectory, velocity,

26:10.003 --> 26:12.701
mass of its component parts,

26:12.745 --> 26:14.747
atomic structure.

26:16.749 --> 26:18.751
What can the computer
now tell you?

26:20.753 --> 26:22.972
It can tell you
how hard the pen was pushed

26:23.016 --> 26:26.889
and it can tell you when the penwill stop rolling.

26:26.933 --> 26:29.892
The computer can see backwards.

26:29.936 --> 26:31.633
The computer can see forwards.

26:33.113 --> 26:35.115
Now do that with everything.

26:37.900 --> 26:39.598
Not just the pen.

26:40.947 --> 26:42.644
Everything.

26:44.690 --> 26:46.692
That's Devs.

27:02.838 --> 27:05.624
Powerful computer
you've got there.

27:11.760 --> 27:13.414
It is.

27:14.502 --> 27:16.722
And you killed Sergei for that.

27:16.765 --> 27:19.768
Not exactly, Lily, no.

27:23.424 --> 27:24.860
I think, for you...

27:26.732 --> 27:28.385
this will be where it gets hard.

27:36.959 --> 27:38.918
I guess she really

27:38.961 --> 27:42.486
loved that young man, huh?

27:42.530 --> 27:44.706
Sergei?
Really cared about him.

27:46.665 --> 27:49.145
Yeah, she did.

27:52.758 --> 27:55.195
It's an amazing thing,
where love'll take you.

27:56.805 --> 27:58.807
The road you'll travel.

28:01.157 --> 28:03.159
The lengths to which you'll go.

28:06.815 --> 28:08.817
You have it in your life?

28:10.471 --> 28:12.778
Uh, had.

28:12.821 --> 28:14.170
Oh.

28:16.912 --> 28:19.915
Well, better
to have loved and lost.

28:23.832 --> 28:25.442
No?

28:25.486 --> 28:28.881
I'd go with:
better to have loved

28:28.924 --> 28:30.970
and everything worked out
totally fine.

28:31.013 --> 28:33.494
Okay, yes.
Fair point.

28:35.844 --> 28:37.498
Me too.

28:43.896 --> 28:45.854
You know my loss.

28:45.898 --> 28:47.900
Everyone does.

28:49.815 --> 28:53.383
Uh... s-sure.

28:57.648 --> 28:59.825
I don't know yours.

28:59.868 --> 29:01.827
It doesn't compare.

29:01.870 --> 29:03.872
I'm very glad.

29:09.225 --> 29:11.271
Uh, yeah.

29:11.314 --> 29:13.273
It's just the...

29:13.316 --> 29:16.798
just the standard,
you know, losing a girl.

29:16.842 --> 29:19.192
Or losing thegirl and...

29:19.235 --> 29:21.629
and the future
you thought you had.

29:21.672 --> 29:24.414
Well, then it does compare.

29:24.458 --> 29:26.460
In that respect, at least.

29:28.984 --> 29:31.291
It's about coming to terms
with that loss.

29:32.901 --> 29:34.555
I guess.

29:39.255 --> 29:41.257
But in all honesty, I...

29:42.781 --> 29:45.087
I never really did
come to terms with it.

29:45.131 --> 29:48.134
You know, me and loss
just kind of...

29:50.571 --> 29:51.877
...kind of coexisted.

29:51.920 --> 29:56.055
Loss as your friend
and constant companion.

29:56.098 --> 29:58.187
Yeah, type of friend

29:58.231 --> 30:00.450
that takes a dump on your face
every morning.

30:00.494 --> 30:02.496
That's the guy.

30:10.156 --> 30:11.853
Can I tell you something, Jamie?

30:15.291 --> 30:17.772
Which is a promise.

30:17.816 --> 30:20.819
Just a straight-up promise,
from me to you.

30:22.298 --> 30:23.909
Okay.

30:23.952 --> 30:26.955
It's all gonna
work out just fine.

30:28.478 --> 30:30.437
What does that...

30:30.480 --> 30:32.874
what does that mean?
What's gonna work out fine?

30:32.918 --> 30:34.571
Everything.

30:37.052 --> 30:38.706
That's the promise.

30:40.926 --> 30:42.928
Everything is gonna
work out fine.

30:51.632 --> 30:54.591
The Devs system works.

30:54.635 --> 30:57.594
In fact, it's worked
for a few months now.

30:57.638 --> 31:00.249
And it's getting better
and more refined all the time.

31:00.293 --> 31:01.729
Even in the last 48 hours,

31:01.772 --> 31:03.774
we've had
a significant breakthrough.

31:04.601 --> 31:06.952
On it, on the system...

31:08.562 --> 31:11.347
...we can run predictions.

31:11.391 --> 31:13.349
They get fuzzierthe further we go back in time,

31:13.393 --> 31:16.265
but, basically,

31:16.309 --> 31:18.920
you can pick any point
in history

31:18.964 --> 31:22.750
and any adjusted
GPS coordinate on the planet,

31:22.793 --> 31:25.013
and we can run
visualizations on it.

31:25.057 --> 31:27.842
Visualizations?

31:27.886 --> 31:29.888
Image.
Sound.

31:31.237 --> 31:33.152
You mean it's a simulation?

31:33.195 --> 31:35.154
Exactly.

31:35.197 --> 31:37.156
A total simulation.

31:37.199 --> 31:38.897
From the quantum level
to the macroscopic.

31:40.768 --> 31:42.726
The past and the future.

31:42.770 --> 31:45.599
The pen rolling backwards.

31:45.642 --> 31:47.644
The pen rolling forwards.

31:53.389 --> 31:56.088
You can look into the past.

31:56.131 --> 31:58.481
We've seen Christ on the cross.

32:00.570 --> 32:03.182
You can look into the future.

32:03.225 --> 32:05.532
We try not to.

32:05.575 --> 32:07.534
It's problematic.

32:07.577 --> 32:10.580
But yes, we can.

32:12.234 --> 32:13.932
We have.

32:22.897 --> 32:24.855
You said, for me,

32:24.899 --> 32:27.075
this'll be where it gets hard.

32:30.470 --> 32:32.124
Yes.

32:33.386 --> 32:35.692
Specifically...

32:35.736 --> 32:37.694
hard for me?

32:37.738 --> 32:40.697
Specifically you, yes.

32:43.396 --> 32:45.050
Why?

32:50.838 --> 32:52.492
Why?

33:01.109 --> 33:03.677
When Devs
first got up and running...

33:05.331 --> 33:08.290
...we looked into the future.

33:08.334 --> 33:10.989
And found we can only see
a few months in advance.

33:12.164 --> 33:14.122
At a certain point,

33:14.166 --> 33:16.733
a fixed point,

33:16.777 --> 33:19.910
the visualization
became pure static.

33:19.954 --> 33:21.912
Like a blizzard.

33:21.956 --> 33:24.959
The future was seeable
right up to that moment.

33:26.656 --> 33:28.006
And after...

33:31.574 --> 33:33.272
impenetrable.

33:35.143 --> 33:37.972
The point of pure static
has grown closer.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.495
It has never extended.

33:40.801 --> 33:42.759
Not even by a minute.

33:42.803 --> 33:44.152
Or a second.

33:49.114 --> 33:51.725
Now, the fixed point

33:51.768 --> 33:54.728
at which the future
becomes lost...

33:54.771 --> 33:56.251
is very close.

33:58.297 --> 34:00.299
21 hours.

34:01.343 --> 34:02.779
Tomorrow night?

34:03.780 --> 34:06.087
Tomorrow night.

34:06.131 --> 34:07.958
Just after 1:00 a.m....

34:09.917 --> 34:11.875
...something happens.

34:11.919 --> 34:13.921
An unknown event.

34:16.010 --> 34:17.968
And it triggers
a total breakdown

34:18.012 --> 34:19.927
in cause and effect.

34:19.970 --> 34:21.929
A breakdown of determinism,

34:21.972 --> 34:24.975
a breakdown of the literal lawsof the universe.

34:31.156 --> 34:33.288
And we think it involves you.

34:35.160 --> 34:36.813
Me?

34:39.294 --> 34:42.602
How could you possibly
think it involves me?

34:42.645 --> 34:44.038
You're there.

34:44.082 --> 34:45.126
Where?

34:45.170 --> 34:47.128
Devs.

34:47.172 --> 34:49.783
I'm at the Devs lab?
At Amaya?

34:49.826 --> 34:52.133
Yes.

34:52.177 --> 34:53.482
But...

34:53.526 --> 34:55.180
We've seen you.

34:58.357 --> 35:00.359
You mean I cause the event?

35:02.187 --> 35:04.145
We think so.

35:04.189 --> 35:05.277
What do I do?

35:05.320 --> 35:06.974
We don't know.

35:09.411 --> 35:11.152
But whatever it is,

35:11.196 --> 35:13.285
it's significant.

35:13.328 --> 35:15.330
To say the least.

35:17.376 --> 35:19.247
I don't understand.

35:23.773 --> 35:25.123
Nobody does.

36:07.121 --> 36:09.123
It's the only sport
I could ever play.

36:13.127 --> 36:15.042
Is Frisbee a sport?

36:15.085 --> 36:16.217
Oh, big sport.

36:18.263 --> 36:20.090
You don't watch the Olympics?

36:22.484 --> 36:24.704
What if you're wrong?

36:24.747 --> 36:26.706
Wrong?

36:26.749 --> 36:28.751
You.

36:30.057 --> 36:32.015
Your tech cult.

36:32.059 --> 36:33.452
Wrong?

36:33.495 --> 36:35.105
It's not me
making the prediction.

36:35.149 --> 36:36.455
It's a machine.

36:36.498 --> 36:38.108
It's the universe.

36:38.152 --> 36:40.850
It's a machine
making the prediction.

36:40.894 --> 36:43.462
What if the machine is wrong?

36:43.505 --> 36:45.507
What happens if I don't
go to Devs tomorrow night?

36:45.551 --> 36:46.856
You will.

36:46.900 --> 36:48.467
What do you mean, I will?

36:48.510 --> 36:51.861
I mean exactly that.
It's what is going to happen.

36:51.905 --> 36:54.516
You're gonna make me?
Your gonna force me to go?

36:54.560 --> 36:56.170
No.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.737
I'm saying it's predetermined.

36:57.780 --> 36:59.739
It's always been predetermined.

36:59.782 --> 37:01.610
You were always
going to go to Devs.

37:01.654 --> 37:04.091
-That's ridiculous.-You are not able to stay away.

37:04.134 --> 37:05.614
I could just choose not to go.

37:05.658 --> 37:07.355
I could drive to Mexico.

37:07.399 --> 37:08.313
-No.
-Set off right now.

37:08.356 --> 37:10.315
-But you won't.
-How the fuck can you tell me

37:10.358 --> 37:12.360
what I will or won't
choose to do?

37:21.326 --> 37:22.979
I get it.

37:24.546 --> 37:26.200
What do you get?

37:28.985 --> 37:30.987
You're fucking delusional.

37:33.338 --> 37:35.340
This is bullshit.

37:38.778 --> 37:42.738
Lily, it's not material
whether you believe me or not.

37:43.783 --> 37:45.350
It's going to happen.

37:45.393 --> 37:46.916
You're going to be there.

37:49.223 --> 37:50.572
I don't think so.

37:52.357 --> 37:54.315
Well...

37:54.359 --> 37:56.317
I guess we'll see.

37:56.361 --> 37:58.363
We will.

38:00.016 --> 38:02.018
Anything else
you need to tell me?

38:05.631 --> 38:07.285
No.

38:23.388 --> 38:25.041
Nice.

38:38.620 --> 38:39.969
I got it.

38:49.544 --> 38:50.850
Y... You okay?

38:50.893 --> 38:52.852
Yeah.

38:52.895 --> 38:54.636
Let's go.

38:55.637 --> 38:57.639
Right.

39:40.813 --> 39:42.815
So you're all buddies now.

39:45.687 --> 39:47.689
Should have fucking guessed.

40:21.549 --> 40:24.509
Think I want to go home.

40:24.552 --> 40:26.511
Home?

40:26.554 --> 40:27.686
Are you sure?

40:27.729 --> 40:29.514
Yeah.

40:29.557 --> 40:32.038
You don't think people are gonnatry to find us there?

40:32.081 --> 40:35.607
If they wanted
to turn us in to the police

40:35.650 --> 40:37.609
or their own security,

40:37.652 --> 40:39.611
they already could have.

40:39.654 --> 40:41.613
That's not
what's on their minds.

40:41.656 --> 40:43.658
What is on their minds?

40:45.225 --> 40:47.227
Madness.

40:48.576 --> 40:50.578
They're insane.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.454
Yeah.

41:36.755 --> 41:39.497
Did you tell her about Sergei?

41:40.846 --> 41:42.500
Yes.

41:44.676 --> 41:46.591
And did you tell her about Devs?

41:47.940 --> 41:50.072
I told her everything.

41:53.989 --> 41:56.688
No.

41:56.731 --> 41:58.080
Not everything.

41:59.168 --> 42:01.170
Right.

42:25.630 --> 42:28.633
Yo, Lily.

42:28.676 --> 42:31.636
I been worried about you.
Where you been hiding?

42:31.679 --> 42:33.072
Here and there.

42:33.115 --> 42:35.030
You're out late tonight, right?

42:35.074 --> 42:36.858
I like it, man.

42:36.902 --> 42:40.166
You know you got to makethe most of life while you can.

42:40.209 --> 42:42.168
Yeah.

42:42.211 --> 42:44.170
You should get some sleep, Pete.

42:44.213 --> 42:45.650
Yeah.

42:45.693 --> 42:48.609
Hey.
Don't worry.

42:48.653 --> 42:50.785
I remember our deal, man.
I'm not talking to you.

42:50.829 --> 42:52.439
Nyet.

42:53.658 --> 42:55.311
Night, dude.

43:21.511 --> 43:22.687
Hey.

43:22.730 --> 43:24.776
You ready to sleep?

43:24.819 --> 43:26.821
Jamie.

43:30.738 --> 43:32.958
Stay in my bed.

43:35.482 --> 43:36.788
It's okay.

43:36.831 --> 43:39.442
I can sleep here fine.

43:39.486 --> 43:41.836
No.

43:43.185 --> 43:45.187
Stay in my bed.

43:50.540 --> 43:52.542
I didn't know him.

43:54.109 --> 43:56.721
I thought I did.

43:56.764 --> 43:59.767
But really... I didn't.

44:02.857 --> 44:04.816
And all...

44:04.859 --> 44:07.340
this-- everything
that's happened

44:07.383 --> 44:08.994
since he died...

44:11.083 --> 44:13.955
...it's sort of been
for nothing.

44:13.999 --> 44:15.565
For something that...

44:16.958 --> 44:18.612
...wasn't there.

44:22.529 --> 44:24.531
I didn't know him.

44:27.229 --> 44:29.231
I know you.

44:33.671 --> 44:35.673
So stay in my bed.

45:27.855 --> 45:30.815
They had guts, those two,
coming here tonight.

45:30.858 --> 45:33.295
Yeah.
They did.

45:37.386 --> 45:39.388
I like Jamie.

45:40.738 --> 45:43.392
He's brave enough
to stand by her.

45:44.829 --> 45:46.831
Truly stand by her.

45:50.443 --> 45:52.837
There's a sort of sweetness
in him, too.

45:56.884 --> 45:59.495
They're brave kids.

45:59.539 --> 46:01.976
Seeing the heart of the storm.

46:02.020 --> 46:04.631
Just going straight to it.

46:04.674 --> 46:06.633
That's her.
Not him.

46:06.676 --> 46:08.026
Yeah, I guess.

46:09.505 --> 46:11.464
She's smart.

46:11.507 --> 46:13.509
And strong as fuck.

46:17.252 --> 46:20.212
There's something else, too.

46:20.255 --> 46:22.736
She has a strange quality.

46:25.130 --> 46:27.697
She's more afraid
of not doing something

46:27.741 --> 46:30.222
than doing something.

46:30.265 --> 46:32.267
Not many people are like that.

46:34.879 --> 46:36.881
And there's a lot of truth
in her.

46:39.057 --> 46:41.059
Not just in what she says,
it's...

46:42.669 --> 46:44.627
...the way she sees.

46:44.671 --> 46:47.152
She sees what's there.

46:49.284 --> 46:51.286
She didn't see it with Sergei.

46:53.114 --> 46:56.074
You know what I mean.

46:56.117 --> 46:57.815
Yeah, I do.

47:00.339 --> 47:02.341
So we like them.

47:04.256 --> 47:05.910
Mm-hmm.

47:10.610 --> 47:12.612
I like you, too.

47:14.135 --> 47:16.094
You do?

47:16.137 --> 47:18.096
Yeah.

47:18.139 --> 47:19.793
I'd say I'm...

47:19.837 --> 47:21.839
in like with you.

47:24.145 --> 47:25.843
Would that be deeply in like?

47:27.757 --> 47:29.716
Fairly deeply.

47:29.759 --> 47:31.761
That's generous.

47:33.981 --> 47:36.984
I'm in fairly deeply like
with you too.

47:40.335 --> 47:43.904
I'm less fairly deeply.
Just so you know.

47:43.948 --> 47:45.950
Sure.

47:51.346 --> 47:53.000
Hey.

47:56.656 --> 47:58.658
It's not long now.

48:00.529 --> 48:02.488
It's no longer years

48:02.531 --> 48:05.621
or months or days.

48:08.233 --> 48:10.061
It's hours, Forest.

48:10.104 --> 48:11.889
That's all.

48:13.542 --> 48:15.544
Hours.

51:26.213 --> 51:28.172
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

51:31.523 --> 51:33.307
This is your station.

51:33.351 --> 51:36.528
But... what am I
actually doing here?

51:36.571 --> 51:38.269
I'm not gonna tell you.

51:38.312 --> 51:41.010
Don't worry.
You're gonna figure it out.

51:52.196 --> 51:54.372
Pulling hair is wrong, mate.

51:54.415 --> 51:57.549
I mean, all violence is wrong,but at least punching's a sport.

51:57.592 --> 51:59.203
-Is it?
-Yes, boxing.

51:59.246 --> 52:01.335
Boxing's in the Olympics.
Hair pulling isn't.

52:02.380 --> 52:05.470
-It would be funny if it was.-It really would be.

52:11.867 --> 52:13.391
Aren't you Lil Dicky?

52:20.485 --> 52:22.835
-Dave.

52:22.878 --> 52:24.532
All-new Wednesday at 10:00
on FXX.

52:24.576 --> 52:26.578
And next day, FX on Hulu.

52:28.275 --> 52:29.537
Oh, damn!

52:39.112 --> 52:41.245
They had come
highly recommended

52:41.288 --> 52:44.770
by a mutual
vampire associate of ours,

52:44.813 --> 52:47.338
but nevertheless,
I found it prudent

52:47.381 --> 52:49.209
-to run the traditional
credit checks...

52:49.253 --> 52:51.472
...and reference protocols.

52:51.516 --> 52:54.780
Suffice it to say,
I am part of the 33%

52:54.823 --> 52:58.566
who find it necessary to utilizemy complimentary credit check

52:58.610 --> 53:00.351
every year.
