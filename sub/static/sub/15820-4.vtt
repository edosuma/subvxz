WEBVTT

00:06.439 --> 00:09.276
Did you know these three
guys who were murdered?

00:10.353 --> 00:14.548
Payaso, Big Mousy, and Little Mousy.

00:14.598 --> 00:17.405
Little Mousy was my future.

00:17.486 --> 00:19.115
Did you belong to him?

00:19.146 --> 00:21.128
I was going to.

00:27.929 --> 00:30.705
They were just here
to kick it, you know?

00:33.844 --> 00:36.953
Had a 40, smoked some
good motta before he left.

00:36.983 --> 00:38.694
About what time was that?

00:38.734 --> 00:40.132
6:00.

00:41.973 --> 00:44.549
Little Mousy got home from
"The Mint" at like 11:00

00:44.579 --> 00:45.363
De la mañana.

00:45.364 --> 00:48.694
Callate, callate, Shy
Girl. Vete a la casa.

00:48.734 --> 00:50.716
You're new, ese.

00:53.060 --> 00:54.932
I'm putting in work six months, vato.

00:54.952 --> 00:57.276
Oh yeah? You got your stripes?

00:59.157 --> 01:00.072
Chavala.

01:00.073 --> 01:02.487
Park used to be mine, homey.

01:03.040 --> 01:04.140
Sanchez.

01:05.978 --> 01:07.658
I heard of you.

01:08.171 --> 01:09.691
Guero.

01:09.731 --> 01:11.723
Little Mousy was one of my brothers.

01:11.763 --> 01:13.604
Mi sangre.

01:13.655 --> 01:16.140
I'm gonna kill the
next Joker i see, homes.

01:16.180 --> 01:17.508
Calmate.

01:17.538 --> 01:20.063
These Jokers are gonna
pay big time, homes!

01:20.083 --> 01:22.337
Ok, Tao, can you read that?

01:23.635 --> 01:26.653
"Trust no bitch."

01:27.035 --> 01:29.852
Well,at least he's not afraid
to be up-front with his feelings.

01:32.287 --> 01:34.621
Sanchez, who were the dead ones dating?

01:34.661 --> 01:36.865
Plenty of those women switch sides.

01:37.498 --> 01:39.571
Now our blood is all over.

01:40.637 --> 01:42.700
Those bitches...

01:43.012 --> 01:45.295
They done with you guys?

01:51.013 --> 01:52.759
We don't keep no 'hood rats, homes.

01:52.789 --> 01:54.333
No?

01:54.374 --> 01:55.605
It's going down.

01:55.635 --> 01:57.972
Tranquilo.

01:59.484 --> 02:00.932
The bullets weren't sprayed.

02:00.971 --> 02:04.366
Each victim died from a
single shot to the t-zone.

02:04.396 --> 02:06.053
Too bad he only got 3 of 'em.

02:06.083 --> 02:09.336
We should give this killer a medal
for cleaning up the neighborhood.

02:09.357 --> 02:11.064
Why is priority homicide here?

02:11.094 --> 02:14.019
I guess triple murder's
our automatic invitation.

02:14.049 --> 02:16.025
These are not priority murders.

02:16.056 --> 02:17.663
Where's Scarlett O'Hara?

02:17.684 --> 02:19.420
The only thing she got
out of our homies here

02:19.440 --> 02:21.237
were different ways
they'd like to do her.

02:21.267 --> 02:24.062
- She's in the van.
- Van? Good.

02:24.103 --> 02:27.047
We should process all
our crime scenes this way.

02:27.078 --> 02:28.325
Come on.

02:28.395 --> 02:30.692
You can buy me a cup of coffee.

02:37.939 --> 02:39.167
Come in.

02:42.202 --> 02:44.199
Department of sanitation's all done.

02:44.218 --> 02:45.226
Can we release the scene?

02:45.227 --> 02:46.635
Sounds good to me.

02:46.655 --> 02:47.755
Thanks.

02:48.491 --> 02:49.769
Can we clean up a little bit in here?

02:49.809 --> 02:52.481
This place is a mess.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:14.184 --> 03:15.518
Sorry.

03:45.542 --> 03:47.716
Excuse me, sir. May i help you?

03:47.796 --> 03:49.611
Depends on who you are.

03:50.677 --> 03:53.131
Deputy Chief Brenda Johnson.

03:54.019 --> 03:56.551
Colonel D.B. Walter United
States Marine Corps, retired.

03:56.581 --> 03:58.177
May i help you?

03:58.416 --> 04:00.401
Do you have any witnesses?

04:01.518 --> 04:03.412
Why are you here, sir?

04:03.443 --> 04:05.018
How many shots were fired?

04:05.058 --> 04:06.534
I asked why you were here?

04:06.563 --> 04:08.430
3, right?

04:09.137 --> 04:10.683
The shooting start
about 8:00 last night?

04:10.712 --> 04:11.679
Let's get one thing straight.

04:11.680 --> 04:13.126
This is not the place of your questions.

04:13.136 --> 04:14.452
This is the place of my questions.

04:14.472 --> 04:15.389
Let's get one thing straight.

04:15.390 --> 04:18.800
I'm not answering any of your
questions unless you answer mine.

04:18.831 --> 04:21.034
It's a serious matter to
withhold material information

04:21.063 --> 04:22.529
About a homicide, Colonel Walter.

04:22.561 --> 04:26.489
I'm not withholding any
material information, madam.

04:26.529 --> 04:28.763
It's just my opinion.

04:29.830 --> 04:31.356
Would you like to hear it?

04:31.395 --> 04:33.091
Yes, i would.

04:33.291 --> 04:37.180
In my opinion, the shooter was on
the roof of the Park Plaza hotel.

04:37.220 --> 04:38.187
Now, you may not believe me

04:38.188 --> 04:41.518
'Cause you're not gonna
find any casings up there.

04:41.627 --> 04:43.133
Now i'll answer your next question.

04:43.168 --> 04:45.011
How do i know that?

04:45.121 --> 04:46.173
In my opinion,

04:46.174 --> 04:48.671
We're not dealing with
an ordinary shooter.

04:48.690 --> 04:50.767
We're dealing with a sniper,

04:50.816 --> 04:53.545
And snipers are trained to be invisible.

04:53.565 --> 04:55.039
I think i can help you find him.

04:55.079 --> 04:56.643
And how could you do that?

04:56.694 --> 04:59.692
I think i was his first instructor.

05:01.006 --> 05:01.957
Do you know his name?

05:01.958 --> 05:06.351
No... but he's my son.

05:06.652 --> 05:09.208
And you don't know his name?

05:09.239 --> 05:12.347
I haven't seen or heard
from my son in over a year.

05:12.378 --> 05:15.868
I thought he was dead until
all these killings started.

05:15.898 --> 05:19.227
- There have been more than these?
- Yes.

05:19.286 --> 05:20.661
Now back to my opinion.

05:20.691 --> 05:24.131
I think if we work
together, we can stop him,

05:24.181 --> 05:26.708
But you've got to keep my opinion
about the sniper away from the press,

05:26.727 --> 05:29.636
otherwise, we both lose
control of this case.

05:29.677 --> 05:33.778
I don't make deals with someone
i just met on a crime scene.

05:34.791 --> 05:39.321
Get to know me.

06:01.448 --> 06:05.026
Trees block the view of
the park from over there,

06:05.056 --> 06:07.898
And that roof offers no protection.

06:07.937 --> 06:09.503
Good eye, Chief.

06:09.542 --> 06:11.138
Good eye.

06:11.198 --> 06:13.381
This cobweb's broken,

06:13.411 --> 06:15.533
But there's no cigarette butts.

06:15.565 --> 06:17.239
No marks in the gravel, either.

06:17.269 --> 06:20.438
Yeah, well, not even Mr.
nobody leaves nothing behind.

06:20.469 --> 06:23.620
I want this entire
roof processed by S.I.D.

06:23.659 --> 06:25.613
You got it, madam.

06:25.772 --> 06:27.945
How'd you know to come up to this roof?

06:27.966 --> 06:29.770
Lucky guess.

06:30.349 --> 06:34.066
The only way up here's through the
building. See if they've got security tapes.

06:37.407 --> 06:40.378
Looks like a good place to shoot from.

06:40.437 --> 06:46.337
I don't think you're the
first person to think of that.

06:58.130 --> 06:59.839
That's little mousy in the center,

06:59.870 --> 07:01.720
Big mousy on the left,

07:01.749 --> 07:02.998
Payoso on the right.

07:03.039 --> 07:04.038
Payaso.

07:04.039 --> 07:05.578
Ok.

07:07.058 --> 07:09.018
The shooter...

07:09.077 --> 07:12.386
waited until he had
protection of the night.

07:13.186 --> 07:15.466
As you can see...

07:17.475 --> 07:22.935
they had time to be afraid.

07:24.713 --> 07:27.193
All right. Can we hit
the lights, please?

07:27.243 --> 07:29.883
3 Match-grade precision
bullet fragments were found.

07:29.922 --> 07:32.602
168-Grain dovetail hollow point.308s.

07:32.641 --> 07:34.591
They leave small entrance wounds,

07:34.621 --> 07:37.880
And grapefruit-sized exit wounds.

07:38.060 --> 07:40.999
Detective Sanchez, how many
sharpshooters did you see

07:41.039 --> 07:43.589
During your years on the
gang intelligence team?

07:43.629 --> 07:44.528
None.

07:44.529 --> 07:47.448
Ok. Will you show us the
lay of the land please?

07:47.489 --> 07:48.798
All right.

07:48.858 --> 07:53.046
Our victims: Big mousy, Little mousy,

07:53.081 --> 07:55.675
Payaso. "Clown"?

07:55.774 --> 07:58.175
These were not veteranos,

07:58.214 --> 07:59.665
But they weren't just jumped in, either.

07:59.705 --> 08:03.874
They were in the middle
management of the E/S 14,

08:03.906 --> 08:06.086
Which means "East Side Catorce."

08:06.125 --> 08:07.204
It's a latino gang,

08:07.205 --> 08:09.906
And they claim the
blocks from 14th street

08:09.935 --> 08:11.435
Up to Wilshire Boulevard.

08:11.466 --> 08:14.097
MacArthur Park is where their turf

08:14.136 --> 08:17.417
Overlaps into another gang, L.A. Jokers.

08:17.446 --> 08:18.836
Now, both gangs are similar.

08:18.877 --> 08:21.516
The both deal coke, rock, and H.

08:21.557 --> 08:24.317
Most recently, they both
branched out into firearms.

08:24.346 --> 08:26.026
So they'd have no trouble getting a gun?

08:26.067 --> 08:27.126
No, no one would.

08:27.127 --> 08:30.407
I mean, an H-S Precision Pro 2000's
the most popular rifle used by S.W.A.T.

08:30.428 --> 08:32.267
It's also available on the internet.

08:32.297 --> 08:33.996
But there's no one in the Jokers

08:34.025 --> 08:36.806
or neither of these gangs
that can shoot like this.

08:36.847 --> 08:39.168
No new guys, no old guys.

08:39.198 --> 08:41.188
So there's a sniper on the loose.

08:41.227 --> 08:42.847
That's one way of saying it.

08:42.888 --> 08:44.668
Any luck with those surveillance tapes?

08:44.697 --> 08:47.468
The Park Plaza hotel had a cooking
convention in the lobby yesterday.

08:47.477 --> 08:49.177
There was a lot of people there. A lot.

08:49.209 --> 08:50.509
All right, lieutenant Flynn,

08:50.538 --> 08:52.478
Could you check out those
tapes for me, please,

08:52.519 --> 08:55.359
And, uh, see if any
faces pop out at you?

08:55.388 --> 08:59.049
We're looking for someone with
military or police training

08:59.077 --> 08:59.966
Who also has a record.

08:59.967 --> 09:02.006
Lieutenant Provenza can help you.

09:02.038 --> 09:03.397
Lieutenant Tao and sergeant Gabriel,

09:03.427 --> 09:05.347
Even though i think it was
picked up on the streets,

09:05.387 --> 09:08.798
Could you check and see who's bought
a sniper rifle in the last year?

09:08.827 --> 09:10.597
That's internet and retail.

09:10.638 --> 09:12.178
Press conference.

09:12.197 --> 09:14.468
Sanchez, i want you to do it.

09:14.508 --> 09:17.467
Do you want me to do it in español?

09:18.549 --> 09:20.108
Couldn't hurt. Come on.

09:20.158 --> 09:22.208
Uh, will, can i talk to
you for just a second?

09:22.238 --> 09:24.689
Hola. Soy detectivo Sanchez.

09:24.718 --> 09:28.279
Estoy aqui para explicar
que paso en el parque.

09:29.450 --> 09:31.169
If you go on the air
and tell Los Angeles

09:31.209 --> 09:32.409
to be on the lookout for a sniper,

09:32.429 --> 09:34.080
it'll be D.C. all over again.

09:34.109 --> 09:36.129
People won't get out of
their cars to get gas.

09:36.159 --> 09:38.609
All right, well, the press already
assumes it's a gang shooting,

09:38.650 --> 09:40.980
So does it help you to have
them continue thinking that?

09:41.000 --> 09:42.420
Well, but the East Side Catorces

09:42.450 --> 09:44.400
Are gonna retaliate against the Jokers.

09:44.431 --> 09:46.990
You can't have it both ways, Brenda.

09:47.150 --> 09:48.800
Make the call.

09:50.920 --> 09:52.471
Ok.

09:53.531 --> 09:54.772
Ok.

09:54.821 --> 09:56.551
"Gang violence escalates."

09:56.611 --> 09:57.801
Ok.

10:03.602 --> 10:05.202
That's Shorty you have there.

10:05.242 --> 10:07.051
It wasn't an important
murder at the time.

10:07.102 --> 10:10.052
Single vic, gang territory.

10:11.472 --> 10:13.372
What about this one?

10:13.423 --> 10:14.392
Topo?

10:14.393 --> 10:16.023
Same deal.

10:16.053 --> 10:17.493
What is that perfume?

10:17.543 --> 10:19.834
I'm not wearing any.

10:21.044 --> 10:22.252
Why?

10:22.294 --> 10:23.132
Do i smell?

10:23.133 --> 10:25.264
Yes... but good.

10:26.544 --> 10:29.584
We didn't find casings or
bullets at either scene.

10:29.613 --> 10:30.904
The casings i can't explain,

10:30.934 --> 10:33.454
But the bullets have such velocity,

10:33.494 --> 10:36.714
They either disintegrate on
contact or go through the head

10:36.754 --> 10:40.194
and deep into whatever's
behind the target.

10:40.265 --> 10:42.025
What about your shampoo?

10:42.065 --> 10:43.084
I don't know.

10:43.085 --> 10:43.924
It was on sale.

10:43.925 --> 10:46.675
Using my homicide analyst again, i see.

10:46.706 --> 10:50.006
Captain Taylor, these 2 gang killings

10:50.026 --> 10:50.835
Which 2?

10:50.836 --> 10:54.636
Gang killings account for 60%
of the homicides in this city.

10:54.665 --> 10:56.045
East Side Catorces?

10:56.077 --> 10:57.736
Only happened last month.

10:57.767 --> 10:59.676
2 vics killed exactly the same way,

10:59.736 --> 11:01.436
Single bullet to the head.

11:01.466 --> 11:03.267
Catorce gets shot, it usually means

11:03.296 --> 11:06.056
he's done something worse
than the Joker who shot him.

11:06.091 --> 11:07.273
It's a two-fer.

11:07.313 --> 11:08.816
Garbage in, garbage out.

11:08.847 --> 11:11.995
Would you be saying this
if the victims were black?

11:14.360 --> 11:15.693
I can go. No.

11:15.733 --> 11:17.418
Yes. No!

11:24.965 --> 11:28.534
These poor, misunderstood youths,

11:28.564 --> 11:30.017
They kill cops.

11:30.068 --> 11:31.170
So when they turn up dead,

11:31.210 --> 11:34.026
I don't see black,
brown, yellow, or white.

11:34.057 --> 11:36.773
The only color i see is blue.

11:36.853 --> 11:39.188
This gang thing didn't
start because of the police,

11:39.209 --> 11:42.747
And it won't end because of the police.

11:42.788 --> 11:44.612
We just contain it.

11:44.663 --> 11:48.049
So investigating these
murders is a waste of time?

11:48.080 --> 11:53.980
How you allocate your
resources is up to you, chief.

12:10.157 --> 12:12.551
I was glad to get your call,

12:12.586 --> 12:14.876
Glad you kept the press out of this.

12:14.911 --> 12:16.953
You know what you're doing here.

12:16.988 --> 12:19.989
I know the esteem policewomen
hold in the military.

12:20.024 --> 12:22.990
It's pretty gutsy of you
to ask a woman for help.

12:23.025 --> 12:26.129
Your reputation canceled out the agenda.

12:26.164 --> 12:29.167
7 years, C.I.A., 4 years, D.C.P.D.,

12:29.202 --> 12:31.938
3 and a half years, Atlanta P.D.

12:31.973 --> 12:35.430
Your father was a captain in the army.

12:35.465 --> 12:36.557
You know the drill.

12:36.558 --> 12:41.401
Well, i got to know you, too,
a little as well... Colonel.

12:41.436 --> 12:45.072
Your most famous shot was from a
moving boat on the Mekong Delta.

12:45.107 --> 12:48.673
You blew off the head of an
enemy sniper from 900 yards.

12:48.708 --> 12:51.311
You had 72 confirmed kills in Vietnam.

12:51.346 --> 12:53.816
That's 9 short of the record.

12:53.851 --> 12:56.286
So you have my military file.

12:59.117 --> 13:01.311
Yeah, it was a big help,

13:01.346 --> 13:03.106
So i googled you.

13:03.141 --> 13:05.961
And you have my son's file as well.

13:10.701 --> 13:12.906
Master gunnery sergeant
D.B. Walter Junior,

13:12.941 --> 13:17.115
Was in a sniper unit as part
of the invasion of Afghanistan,

13:17.150 --> 13:20.538
And in spring 2003, he was sent home...

13:20.573 --> 13:22.068
Because?

13:22.358 --> 13:25.818
His wife was a social worker...

13:25.853 --> 13:27.306
Killed by a stray bullet

13:27.341 --> 13:33.081
Shot by an East Side Catorce.

13:33.116 --> 13:35.542
Her name was Donna.

13:35.577 --> 13:37.968
Wonderful girl.

13:38.003 --> 13:38.879
Wonderful.

13:38.880 --> 13:42.062
Is her case still open?

13:42.063 --> 13:46.063
Yes. Still interested in my opinion?

13:46.064 --> 13:49.164
Aaa.. very.
-That's why my son is doing this.

13:49.165 --> 13:51.465
You people can't find who killed her

13:51.835 --> 13:57.735
and he's not gonna stop until
every East Side Catorce is dead.

13:57.877 --> 14:00.220
This happened in spring 2003.

14:00.260 --> 14:02.521
What took your son so
long to seek revenge?

14:02.551 --> 14:04.436
He thought the L.A.P.D.
Was gonna do its job.

14:04.456 --> 14:06.147
He waited, and nothing happened.

14:06.167 --> 14:08.612
Last christmas, he
walked out of the house

14:08.632 --> 14:10.323
and never came home,

14:10.353 --> 14:13.398
set out to start his own war.

14:14.080 --> 14:16.016
Tell me how you can help me.

14:16.046 --> 14:18.948
You're not gonna find
my son on your own.

14:18.969 --> 14:20.538
He's behind enemy lines,

14:20.568 --> 14:23.501
disguised within the community.

14:23.531 --> 14:26.811
I can tell you how he thinks.

14:26.913 --> 14:30.091
I want your son's
uncensored military records.

14:30.141 --> 14:33.603
I need a list of every
known East Side Catorce,

14:33.645 --> 14:35.142
Names and addresses.

14:35.162 --> 14:36.832
I want your records, too.

14:36.863 --> 14:38.288
Only if...

14:38.330 --> 14:41.008
I give you the lists?

14:50.948 --> 14:53.912
What do you hope to get from helping me?

14:56.396 --> 14:59.350
My wife died 14 years ago,

14:59.390 --> 15:01.580
And you know how it is.

15:01.620 --> 15:04.951
Move from post to post, base to base.

15:05.468 --> 15:07.998
Family becomes everything.

15:08.670 --> 15:12.269
My boy is all i've got left.

15:12.304 --> 15:13.912
I have a feeling

15:14.749 --> 15:16.860
if i'm there when you find him,

15:17.103 --> 15:19.149
we'll be able to take him alive.

15:22.911 --> 15:26.211
So... partners then?

15:28.441 --> 15:30.513
Partners.

15:59.915 --> 16:03.004
Well, i know you can talk.

16:03.424 --> 16:05.853
I need your help.

16:09.332 --> 16:11.032
Again?

16:12.262 --> 16:14.521
Does this face look familiar?

16:14.552 --> 16:18.741
His wife was killed, spring 2003.

16:18.790 --> 16:20.850
She was a social worker
checking on a foster kid

16:20.861 --> 16:23.830
when she was hit by stray bullets.

16:24.950 --> 16:26.930
I remember the case.

16:26.979 --> 16:28.700
What was her last name again?

16:28.729 --> 16:30.069
Walter?

16:30.108 --> 16:32.077
No, i don't think so.

16:33.017 --> 16:35.923
It was...

16:36.003 --> 16:37.305
Quinn.

16:37.357 --> 16:40.622
Donna Quinn. She kept her maiden name.

16:42.295 --> 16:43.798
There she is.

16:45.030 --> 16:47.616
She was beautiful.

16:52.855 --> 16:58.755
Looks like we interviewed
several East Side Catorces, but...

16:59.357 --> 17:00.398
Nothing.

17:00.399 --> 17:01.419
Nada.

17:01.420 --> 17:02.825
And her husband came to see you?

17:02.844 --> 17:06.722
Yeah. He, uh, wanted to know
why we weren't doing more.

17:06.752 --> 17:08.085
We offered a reward,

17:08.133 --> 17:11.009
set up a tip line, recanvassed
the neighborhood. I...

17:11.040 --> 17:12.212
How did he act?

17:12.252 --> 17:14.045
Was he angry? Did he lash out?

17:14.085 --> 17:17.152
No, no, no. He was very
calm, very respectful,

17:17.192 --> 17:18.428
Just like his father.

17:19.058 --> 17:20.619
When did you meet his father?

17:20.660 --> 17:24.202
Oh, must have been january 2004.

17:24.242 --> 17:26.194
Came to report his son missing.

17:26.234 --> 17:29.204
Asked to speak only to me.

17:29.264 --> 17:30.482
And did you look for him?

17:30.513 --> 17:32.274
We filed a missing persons report,

17:32.313 --> 17:36.470
but we never found the boy
or the car he was driving.

17:37.115 --> 17:40.158
He was licensed to
carry guns... many guns,

17:40.797 --> 17:44.062
And i assumed... Well,
he killed himself.

17:46.033 --> 17:48.048
Suicide rate among returning vets

17:48.089 --> 17:51.107
is somewhere in the 17% range.

17:51.148 --> 17:52.965
I looked at the father, and i thought,

17:53.014 --> 17:56.152
here's a guy who would rather
believe that his son is missing

17:56.182 --> 17:59.210
than-than that the boy killed himself.

17:59.251 --> 18:02.231
Never underestimate the power of grief.

18:02.269 --> 18:04.265
Or the need for revenge.

18:07.857 --> 18:10.021
Let's assume that the son is alive

18:10.062 --> 18:12.301
and he's the shooter.

18:13.466 --> 18:15.633
What do you need?

18:15.673 --> 18:17.644
A Catorce that'll talk to me.

18:21.144 --> 18:24.295
I told you he was gonna stop
and get something to eat.

18:24.475 --> 18:26.916
I'm still fuzzy as to why we're on him.

18:26.946 --> 18:31.337
I'm not sure this is more fun Than
the international cooking convention.

18:31.377 --> 18:33.318
I don't know about that.

18:33.348 --> 18:35.128
Did you see the guy
selling steak knives?

18:35.168 --> 18:36.530
Which one? There were like 4 of them.

18:36.568 --> 18:39.870
I'm talking about the one where you
got this really nice butcher block.

18:39.899 --> 18:40.749
I'm telling you, flynn,

18:40.750 --> 18:43.230
these steak knives could cut cans.

18:43.259 --> 18:45.861
And he had this deal where
if you bought one set,

18:45.891 --> 18:48.862
you get this really
nice set of dishtowels-

18:54.043 --> 18:57.745
This woman is going to drive me crazy.

18:58.574 --> 19:00.495
Provenza here.

19:00.617 --> 19:02.306
Hello, chief.

19:03.366 --> 19:06.547
The colonel stopped
to get a bite to eat.

19:07.867 --> 19:09.489
Yep.

19:10.519 --> 19:12.159
Nope.

19:14.650 --> 19:17.971
We don't plan on losing him, ma'am.

19:18.020 --> 19:21.281
That's why we're sitting here.

19:25.933 --> 19:28.613
My ex-wife used to call me like that,

19:28.654 --> 19:31.115
talk to me like i was a child.

19:31.164 --> 19:32.565
Which ex-wife was this?

19:32.586 --> 19:33.885
Number 2.

19:33.935 --> 19:36.436
And number 4.

19:36.516 --> 19:39.847
I forgot how annoying she
was and married her twice.

19:40.637 --> 19:42.468
Did you divorce her, or did she..

19:42.507 --> 19:45.769
Don't get bogged down in technicalities.

19:50.907 --> 19:54.022
Yeah. Yeah, all right.

19:56.838 --> 19:58.316
Yo, what's up, my brother?

19:58.356 --> 20:00.506
You looking to buy some blunts?

20:00.537 --> 20:02.970
Yo, where your ho at, my brotha?

20:03.020 --> 20:06.498
Cause i know you the
original gangsta, yo.

20:07.221 --> 20:09.705
I'm not your brother.

20:11.273 --> 20:13.684
What, you don't like mexicans?

20:13.727 --> 20:15.927
Yeah, i could tell.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.683
Watch your back, brother.

20:18.812 --> 20:21.355
I'm taking over.

20:21.939 --> 20:23.039
Jesus.

20:23.633 --> 20:25.968
Yo, where'd you find this fool, man?

20:25.991 --> 20:27.482
Yeah, he come with the new job?

20:42.830 --> 20:46.246
Prolonging it won't make it
any better, detective Tao.

20:46.277 --> 20:47.339
Spill.

20:47.340 --> 20:51.060
It seems colonel Walter
evaded surveillance.

20:52.115 --> 20:53.798
Who's colonel Walter,

20:53.817 --> 20:56.026
and why was he being surveilled?

20:56.067 --> 20:58.783
Someone the chief wanted us to follow.

20:58.814 --> 20:59.857
Maybe i should go tell her-

20:59.858 --> 21:01.438
No, no.

21:01.580 --> 21:03.111
She and Taylor are
playing nice for a change.

21:03.142 --> 21:05.974
Why don't we all just enjoy the moment.

21:07.401 --> 21:09.088
What's up, yo?

21:09.138 --> 21:12.112
You mean your mommy and daddy
gonna watch out for you, man?

21:12.141 --> 21:15.466
You can't slide up in here
by yourself... or what?

21:15.497 --> 21:17.616
Is he that other one's daddy?

21:17.646 --> 21:20.408
You know, the fool.

21:20.689 --> 21:22.015
Hey, you look alike.

21:22.046 --> 21:23.282
Mr. Garcia...

21:23.331 --> 21:25.651
Mr. Garcia?

21:26.455 --> 21:29.489
Es tan bonita cuando no abre la boca

21:29.529 --> 21:30.966
Speakie spanish?

21:30.995 --> 21:32.181
Like your prison?

21:32.211 --> 21:34.179
Hey, man, i came in
here because you said

21:34.201 --> 21:36.199
you were gonna make that
carjacking thing go away.

21:36.229 --> 21:38.349
We might. Just listen.

21:38.369 --> 21:42.456
Spring 2003 this woman,
Donna Quinn, was killed.

21:42.497 --> 21:45.852
Witnesses saw a gangster car
speeding away from the house.

21:45.872 --> 21:47.729
Man, every homie in the
city's got a cutlass.

21:47.749 --> 21:48.613
That don't mean nothing.

21:48.614 --> 21:50.472
Your brother Martin Garcia,

21:50.513 --> 21:54.108
"Mosca" had a car like
that registered to him.

21:54.350 --> 21:55.887
All right.

21:55.926 --> 21:58.930
Hay un hombre who was
just bugging me about this.

21:58.970 --> 22:00.538
He was bugging a couple of us.

22:00.567 --> 22:02.234
Oh, yeah? What's he look like.

22:02.265 --> 22:03.832
Like that one right there,

22:03.852 --> 22:05.067
Pero mas taller,

22:05.097 --> 22:06.715
Atletico.

22:06.744 --> 22:08.533
Firme.

22:11.907 --> 22:15.625
Do you like your men... burnt?

22:17.101 --> 22:18.296
Enough talk.

22:18.336 --> 22:21.561
You tell us who shot this woman.

22:22.123 --> 22:23.449
I know you can speak english.

22:23.469 --> 22:25.086
I know you speak perfectly good english.

22:25.106 --> 22:26.543
Hey, man, bitch is dead.

22:26.573 --> 22:28.451
Rest in peace.

22:29.948 --> 22:32.781
We're not saying you did it,

22:32.811 --> 22:33.996
But you were there.

22:34.026 --> 22:35.985
Nah, man. Spring 2003?

22:36.005 --> 22:37.120
I was right in the beef.

22:37.150 --> 22:38.958
I was in county. Wayside, homes.

22:38.978 --> 22:40.957
She was shot march 22.

22:40.987 --> 22:43.307
You were released from
prison 4 days before.

22:43.337 --> 22:45.648
And the person who lived at
the house where she was shot

22:45.667 --> 22:47.918
is rumored to have killed your primo.

22:47.948 --> 22:48.921
So come on.

22:48.922 --> 22:50.580
Must have had some payback coming.

22:50.610 --> 22:53.342
Man, sounds like you know more
about this than i do, homes.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.281
So why you asking me
all these questions?

22:55.311 --> 22:58.937
Because the Jokers didn't
do the shootings in the park.

22:58.978 --> 23:01.387
Your friends were killed by a sniper.

23:02.151 --> 23:03.818
No way.

23:03.940 --> 23:09.062
Same guy shot Shorty and Topo, too.

23:09.696 --> 23:11.081
Think about it, son.

23:11.122 --> 23:14.176
One shot to the head, each of 'em.

23:14.205 --> 23:16.575
It was retaliation for
Donna Quinn's death.

23:16.606 --> 23:18.645
What is she talking about?

23:19.218 --> 23:20.513
Who was she having followed again?

23:20.553 --> 23:23.546
Now we don't know
who's next on his list,

23:23.578 --> 23:26.209
But if that sniper wants
you, he's gonna get you,

23:26.229 --> 23:28.840
Unless you tell us who killed her,

23:28.870 --> 23:30.809
And then maybe we can stop this guy.

23:30.839 --> 23:32.718
Think of your homies.

23:32.738 --> 23:36.244
You could save their
lives, not just yours.

23:38.633 --> 23:41.145
We can find you a new place to live.

23:41.175 --> 23:43.686
We can get your whole family
out of here in about an hour.

23:43.716 --> 23:48.156
If you're sick of the
life, this is your out.

23:50.648 --> 23:52.927
Your abuelita's in the hospital, que no?

23:52.948 --> 23:55.208
Yeah. She's at Good Samaritan.

23:55.228 --> 23:56.189
She's really sick.

23:56.190 --> 23:57.858
Oh. Wacha.

23:57.888 --> 24:01.465
Who's gonna take care of her
when something happens to you?

24:09.064 --> 24:11.960
Man, no one even knew that
black bitch was even there, man.

24:12.275 --> 24:14.510
Homie, que pasa?

24:15.089 --> 24:16.725
Hermano, i gotta go, man.

24:16.755 --> 24:18.645
We were just talking, right?

24:18.676 --> 24:19.996
- Am i under arrest?
- No.

24:20.017 --> 24:20.910
Please
- later, Sanchez.

24:20.911 --> 24:22.110
Wait.

24:24.193 --> 24:26.143
Another Catorce is dead.

24:26.163 --> 24:29.496
And who the hell is
colonel Walter U.S.M.C?

24:29.526 --> 24:32.310
Because Flynn and Provenza lost him.

24:32.392 --> 24:34.152
Can i talk to you for a minute, Will?

24:41.459 --> 24:44.162
- What?
- I might have made a big mistake.

24:44.408 --> 24:48.712
I might have given a list of
known Catorces to the killer.

24:48.742 --> 24:50.704
You-you might have?

24:50.745 --> 24:53.257
Plus their addresses.

24:53.356 --> 24:57.761
I may have led our
killer to the next victim.

25:06.779 --> 25:07.879
He lived in this building.

25:07.911 --> 25:09.742
His street name is "Vaquero" cowboy,

25:09.772 --> 25:11.434
But i'm waiting for an I.D.

25:11.473 --> 25:12.404
He was killed by a-

25:12.405 --> 25:14.737
Single shot to the head.

25:15.988 --> 25:18.931
Somebody briefed you already?

25:34.936 --> 25:36.177
How'd you get here so fast?

25:36.207 --> 25:38.028
Police scanner.

25:39.330 --> 25:41.282
- You don't have to believe me.
- I don't.

25:41.311 --> 25:43.293
Haven't lied to you yet.
Why would i start now?

25:43.323 --> 25:45.916
Because you found your
son, or you did this.

25:45.956 --> 25:48.689
You had me followed. You know i didn't.

25:48.718 --> 25:50.470
You deliberately evaded surveillance.

25:50.500 --> 25:52.812
You paid some guy from
the gas company 200 bucks

25:52.842 --> 25:54.254
To swap clothes with you.

25:54.274 --> 25:55.655
I didn't kill him.

25:55.685 --> 25:57.057
I am bringing you in for questioning.

25:57.077 --> 25:58.668
Viva la Catorce!

25:58.698 --> 26:00.079
Get down!

26:03.382 --> 26:04.913
Chief?

26:05.684 --> 26:07.376
I'm fine.

26:14.122 --> 26:17.105
This is the fallout from
trusting your suspect:

26:17.156 --> 26:18.477
4 people killed last night,

26:18.507 --> 26:21.029
Including these 2 young boys.

26:21.069 --> 26:22.641
I know. Believe me, i know.

26:22.680 --> 26:25.393
I've heard captain
Taylor's side on this, too.

26:25.443 --> 26:26.303
I'm sure you have.

26:26.304 --> 26:28.315
Why were you not seriously
considering the possibility

26:28.356 --> 26:31.709
that the son was dead, the
colonel was the shooter?

26:31.739 --> 26:32.618
I don't know.

26:32.619 --> 26:34.181
Well, i think i do,

26:34.211 --> 26:35.602
Because every time
you see a military man,

26:35.633 --> 26:37.425
you go all weak in the knees.

26:37.474 --> 26:39.567
Guy puts a little american
flag pin on his lapel,

26:39.597 --> 26:40.636
and suddenly you think he's your daddy!

26:40.637 --> 26:42.739
All right, Will!

26:42.819 --> 26:44.951
I may have made a mistake, ok?

26:44.981 --> 26:46.433
But if we announce
that we're redirecting

26:46.482 --> 26:47.844
this investigation towards the sniper,

26:47.874 --> 26:50.287
i'll lose all credibility
with colonel Walter.

26:50.317 --> 26:51.437
He'll never talk to me again.

26:51.468 --> 26:54.350
Well, use that credibility
now, Brenda, or lose it,

26:54.400 --> 26:55.821
because i'm not gonna
let a gang war start

26:55.841 --> 26:57.323
just so you can get this guy to confess.

26:57.363 --> 26:58.954
You want another crack at him, fine.

26:58.984 --> 27:00.666
You have until the 6:00 news

27:00.686 --> 27:03.329
to break him in half.

27:12.447 --> 27:15.480
You don't have a police
scanner in your car.

27:15.509 --> 27:17.932
So either you knew where the
crime was going to take place,

27:17.952 --> 27:20.175
In which case you are not
sharing information with me

27:20.214 --> 27:21.385
as you promised to do,

27:21.415 --> 27:25.830
or you're killing
these Catorces yourself.

27:25.849 --> 27:26.951
Well, if you think i did it,

27:26.991 --> 27:28.652
why don't you hold me
here until the next murder.

27:28.682 --> 27:33.737
I have no intention of waiting
around for someone else to die.

27:33.787 --> 27:35.499
We are getting to the
truth of this, colonel,

27:35.539 --> 27:38.692
right now, this instant.

27:38.731 --> 27:39.802
Either you prove to me

27:39.803 --> 27:41.024
That you had nothing to do with this,

27:41.054 --> 27:43.256
Or i walk out of here
and call the F.B.I.,

27:43.286 --> 27:45.248
the C.I.A. and Homeland Security

27:45.258 --> 27:49.052
and tell them i have a military-trained
sniper in my interview room

27:49.081 --> 27:51.874
who's using the citizens of
los angeles for target practice.

27:51.914 --> 27:53.215
How can i prove that i'm not-

27:53.245 --> 27:55.788
That is not my problem.

27:58.741 --> 27:59.902
Ok.

27:59.952 --> 28:01.453
Wait, wait!

28:01.513 --> 28:02.855
Wait.

28:03.415 --> 28:05.917
Wait a minute.

28:11.873 --> 28:15.416
2 first-class tickets, L.A.X.

28:15.446 --> 28:19.190
Our passports, his and mine.

28:19.220 --> 28:20.951
Going to South Africa.

28:20.992 --> 28:22.292
Here.

28:22.353 --> 28:24.194
I was trying to find him before you did,

28:24.224 --> 28:26.406
to get him out of the country.

28:26.437 --> 28:30.080
My boy is not a
murderer, he's a soldier.

28:30.110 --> 28:31.130
And who is he killing?

28:31.131 --> 28:34.734
He's killing our enemies in the streets.

28:36.596 --> 28:39.839
Meet Miguel and Luis.

28:39.909 --> 28:42.051
They were also shot to death last night.

28:42.071 --> 28:43.081
Why?

28:43.082 --> 28:45.104
Because they were
standing next to a Joker

28:45.134 --> 28:47.146
Whom the Catorces decided to blow away

28:47.186 --> 28:49.418
In retaliation for your son's killings.

28:49.468 --> 28:51.139
Oh, my god.

28:52.541 --> 28:53.792
Oh, my god.

28:53.813 --> 28:56.285
Are they our enemies, too?

28:56.325 --> 28:58.867
Or just collateral damage
in your son's private war?

28:58.896 --> 29:00.548
You know i don't think like that.

29:00.579 --> 29:01.940
I helped you. I gave you-

29:01.970 --> 29:03.261
Useless information!

29:03.291 --> 29:04.762
Don't pretend that we were partners.

29:04.782 --> 29:05.693
You manipulated me-

29:05.694 --> 29:06.894
I never manipulated you!

29:06.924 --> 29:08.526
I have nothing but the
utmost respect for you.

29:08.546 --> 29:11.509
Snipers are invisible,
that's what you said,

29:11.539 --> 29:13.250
trained to avoid detection.

29:13.281 --> 29:14.852
Yet you deliberately caught my attention

29:14.891 --> 29:16.313
by walking across my crime scene

29:16.333 --> 29:17.915
with a rifle scope in your hand,

29:17.945 --> 29:20.016
conned me into keeping
the truth from the press,

29:20.067 --> 29:22.719
traded me meaningless military records

29:22.749 --> 29:25.461
for names and addresses of
your son's potential victims.

29:25.502 --> 29:26.833
I had to stop him, you know that.

29:26.903 --> 29:29.496
He can be stopped. My
boy is not a monster.

29:29.516 --> 29:32.708
We've got 3 hours left to prove that,

29:32.739 --> 29:35.180
Because then my boss calls
the federal government

29:35.211 --> 29:37.433
and releases your son's
photo to the press.

29:37.463 --> 29:39.975
3 hours, and i lose control
of this investigation.

29:40.006 --> 29:42.848
3 hours, and this turns
into a full-on manhunt.

29:42.878 --> 29:44.970
They'll kill him.

29:46.301 --> 29:48.984
Then tell me how he's
choosing his victims.

29:49.024 --> 29:50.235
Look over the surveillance tapes

29:50.265 --> 29:52.317
that we've got from
the Park Plaza hotel.

29:52.357 --> 29:55.309
See if you can help us I.D. him.

29:56.521 --> 29:59.563
Help me save your son's life.

30:03.828 --> 30:07.041
Who is manipulating who?

30:12.506 --> 30:14.017
Ok.

30:15.869 --> 30:18.432
I'll help you...

30:19.643 --> 30:21.634
If you take me along.

30:21.694 --> 30:23.586
Sorry.

30:23.646 --> 30:26.088
No more negotiating.

30:26.599 --> 30:31.003
Don't leave me behind, please.

30:31.023 --> 30:35.928
3 hours, and the clock is ticking.

30:41.473 --> 30:42.724
Wait, wait, wait.

30:42.764 --> 30:44.906
Stop the tape here.

30:45.016 --> 30:47.058
Back it up a bit.

31:04.415 --> 31:06.947
Hmm. Freeze it right here.

31:08.549 --> 31:10.310
Is it possible to see this enhanced?

31:10.340 --> 31:11.801
You got it.

31:15.966 --> 31:18.318
Is it the mailman?

31:18.748 --> 31:20.379
No.

31:20.750 --> 31:24.053
Sunglasses and backpack.

31:24.784 --> 31:25.754
No.

31:25.755 --> 31:27.796
No, that's not him.

31:28.917 --> 31:31.119
I can only assume that my
son knew the hotel so well

31:31.150 --> 31:34.433
that he was able to avoid the cameras.

31:34.863 --> 31:39.647
So, now tell me how he's
choosing his victims.

31:42.320 --> 31:44.902
After Donna died,

31:44.942 --> 31:49.317
there was an article in
the times with this photo.

31:50.838 --> 31:52.149
It was a skateboard star

31:52.169 --> 31:54.071
who was introducing
a new line of clothes,

31:54.111 --> 31:57.144
said his inspiration
came from the streets.

31:57.264 --> 31:59.646
Look how fat and happy they are.

31:59.677 --> 32:03.089
Infuriated my son and infuriated me.

32:04.731 --> 32:07.664
First victim, Shorty.

32:07.723 --> 32:10.066
Next, Topo.

32:10.366 --> 32:12.628
Little Mousy, Big Mousy,

32:12.678 --> 32:15.221
Payaso.

32:15.301 --> 32:16.432
Vaquero.

32:16.483 --> 32:18.354
He's going in order.

32:21.567 --> 32:24.309
This guy is next. His
name is Hector Vasquez.

32:24.329 --> 32:25.971
"Toker".

32:28.153 --> 32:30.385
Ok, thank you.

32:34.239 --> 32:35.159
No way.

32:35.160 --> 32:36.601
A man's life is in danger.

32:36.631 --> 32:37.501
So says your source,

32:37.502 --> 32:39.074
who's been so good at telling the truth.

32:39.094 --> 32:40.224
Look, you are upset about-

32:40.245 --> 32:42.186
Yeah, about children getting shot.

32:42.217 --> 32:45.910
This guy Toker spent 2 years in
juvie for assaulting his mother.

32:45.940 --> 32:49.673
I'm not getting you bodyguards
to protect a gangbanger.

32:49.733 --> 32:53.196
But my team is my team, right?

32:53.216 --> 32:56.179
Have you ever run one of these?

32:58.451 --> 33:00.453
Will you take tactical?

33:00.503 --> 33:03.507
Yeah. You want my men in on this?

33:03.556 --> 33:07.640
How you allocate your
resources is up to you, captain.

33:10.743 --> 33:12.034
And i'd like to remind everybody

33:12.075 --> 33:14.496
That while Walter Jr., our sniper,

33:14.527 --> 33:15.718
has been trained by the best,

33:15.738 --> 33:20.062
he's out to get the Catorces, not us.

33:20.111 --> 33:25.107
Um, captain Taylor has
agreed to run this operation.

33:25.127 --> 33:26.958
So, captain Taylor?

33:27.008 --> 33:28.519
She's delegating?

33:28.570 --> 33:31.042
What do you know about
that? Pigs can fly.

33:31.062 --> 33:32.894
All right, everyone, listen up.

33:32.934 --> 33:36.197
First we'll get onto the roofs
Of the surrounding buildings.

33:36.237 --> 33:38.058
Once we are in position to cover him

33:38.109 --> 33:40.661
we will send Sanchez
up to Toker's house,

33:40.711 --> 33:43.454
let him try and talk the
boy into protective custody.

33:43.494 --> 33:46.116
And if we are lucky, emphasis on lucky,

33:46.146 --> 33:49.330
while our sniper's
fixated on his next target,

33:49.369 --> 33:53.303
we'll get a chance to surprise him.

33:53.333 --> 33:56.005
We got about 45 minutes until nightfall.

33:56.035 --> 33:57.427
Keep your talkies on,

33:57.457 --> 33:59.939
and i want to see vests on everyone,

33:59.979 --> 34:02.684
and i mean everyone.

34:03.394 --> 34:05.435
What are we still doing
here? Let's do this.

34:05.645 --> 34:08.831
Uh, maybe it would be better
If we left the O.G. Here, sir.

34:09.824 --> 34:10.616
Fine with me.

34:10.617 --> 34:13.655
You guys go get shot at,
And i'll watch it on TV.

34:13.706 --> 34:14.911
I'll meet you at the house.

34:25.945 --> 34:28.550
I've gotten permission
for you to accompany us.

34:28.570 --> 34:30.233
No.

34:31.828 --> 34:33.791
It's too late.

34:34.632 --> 34:36.688
I'll wait for you here.

34:36.717 --> 34:39.094
I promise you, sir,

34:39.134 --> 34:41.428
i will do everything in my power

34:41.447 --> 34:44.404
to bring your son in alive.

35:37.749 --> 35:39.470
I'll drive.

35:45.037 --> 35:46.989
What do you feel like having
for dinner? Drive-through?

35:47.019 --> 35:48.617
Ok, whatever. Sounds good.

35:48.647 --> 35:50.259
Hey, um, will you watch the doors

35:50.279 --> 35:51.949
and see if you see a
tall black man leaving?

35:51.989 --> 35:54.319
He's 6'2" and has perfect posture.

35:54.340 --> 35:55.637
Is he coming to dinner with us?

35:55.667 --> 35:59.286
No. This is less about dinner
and more about a joint operation

35:59.317 --> 36:02.619
between the F.B.I. and the L.A.P.D.

36:11.157 --> 36:13.287
Is this official?

36:13.457 --> 36:15.106
Oh, of course. Yeah.

36:15.137 --> 36:18.556
I'm just a little behind
on my paperwork, that's all.

36:25.616 --> 36:28.106
He's pulling out of the lot.

36:28.244 --> 36:29.515
Could you follow him, please,

36:29.555 --> 36:30.484
and be extra careful,

36:30.485 --> 36:33.756
because he's very good
at detecting surveillance.

36:36.924 --> 36:38.024
Hello, Mr. Howard.

36:38.054 --> 36:40.104
The time is 7:32 pm.

36:40.134 --> 36:43.244
Your location is 150
north Los Angeles street.

36:43.274 --> 36:44.073
What is that?

36:44.074 --> 36:46.184
I call her Tara.

36:46.244 --> 36:49.124
I think it's the same woman
who does my voice mail.

36:49.164 --> 36:51.054
My navigation system.

36:51.313 --> 36:54.112
Oh. I have got to get one of those.

36:57.413 --> 36:59.393
I must really like you.

37:29.192 --> 37:31.211
Usually we do this with backup,

37:31.241 --> 37:32.812
where we block off
the surrounding area..

37:32.841 --> 37:33.629
Can you still see him?

37:33.630 --> 37:34.520
Or, you know what i would have done?

37:34.521 --> 37:36.290
I would've put an
auto-track on his car,

37:36.310 --> 37:38.101
Or a GPS homing device on the car-

37:38.140 --> 37:41.750
I could've done all that,
but instead i called you.

37:42.140 --> 37:45.426
And for that i am grateful.

37:48.102 --> 37:50.097
Sanchez.

37:50.530 --> 37:53.030
Sanchez, go.

38:05.627 --> 38:07.985
What's going on? Do you think
he knows he's being followed?

38:08.016 --> 38:11.178
I'm driving parallel to
him, so i don't think so.

38:12.221 --> 38:13.878
What? What's going on?

38:13.898 --> 38:15.033
I think he's winking at me.

38:15.053 --> 38:16.457
Don't look directly at him!

38:16.488 --> 38:19.489
- Brenda...
- Don't look at me either!

38:19.771 --> 38:21.385
You know, when i imagined
you in my back seat,

38:21.426 --> 38:24.227
This isn't exactly what i had in mind.

38:27.488 --> 38:29.697
Captain, what's that?

38:30.630 --> 38:32.195
That's him.

38:32.357 --> 38:35.608
All units respond, 200 block of Loma.

38:35.659 --> 38:37.306
Grey apartment building, on the roof.

38:37.335 --> 38:39.444
Let's move it now!

38:53.656 --> 38:55.432
F.B.I.! Don't move!

38:55.493 --> 38:58.533
Stand up! Put your
hands over your head now!

38:58.582 --> 39:01.034
Back up.

39:01.054 --> 39:04.195
Hands behind your head, slowly.

39:16.741 --> 39:19.152
On your knees. On your knees.

39:24.517 --> 39:26.207
Taylor. Go.

39:26.239 --> 39:29.892
Let me show this
high-powered sniper rifle.

39:51.164 --> 39:52.336
Taylor. Go.

39:52.365 --> 39:53.778
This is Sanchez.

39:53.809 --> 39:56.841
Toker's in county.
He's been there for, like, 4 days now.

39:56.868 --> 39:58.531
Unbelievable!

40:06.636 --> 40:09.742
Are we anywhere near Lucas avenue?

40:10.713 --> 40:13.649
We're moving away from Lucas avenue.

40:14.149 --> 40:16.047
Wanted him to be telling me the truth.

40:16.086 --> 40:18.214
- She set us up.
- No, she didn't.

40:18.244 --> 40:19.383
Well, then, where is she?

40:19.403 --> 40:20.853
That's a good question. I'll find out.

40:20.892 --> 40:22.721
She was never planning to show.

40:22.761 --> 40:23.999
You know, i had her all wrong.

40:24.040 --> 40:26.306
She's an even bigger bitch
than i thought she was.

40:26.336 --> 40:28.177
Hey, it's Gabriel. Where are you?

40:28.207 --> 40:29.213
Such a suck-up.

40:29.214 --> 40:30.503
Yeah, well, we have a problem.

40:30.543 --> 40:31.591
Yeah, no kidding.

40:31.592 --> 40:34.090
Toker is in county.

40:35.867 --> 40:38.047
Jesus said he saw the
colonel talking to these guys.

40:38.067 --> 40:40.035
He must have known.

40:40.104 --> 40:42.233
No, i didn't know till just now.

40:42.273 --> 40:43.822
I followed him to cover our base-

40:43.851 --> 40:47.598
Do you really think i'd send
you on a wild-goose chase?

40:47.767 --> 40:48.526
Damn it.

40:48.527 --> 40:49.956
What? What's
- what's going on?

40:49.975 --> 40:52.354
The colonel lied to me.

40:52.384 --> 40:53.612
Hey, you want me to turn around,

40:53.631 --> 40:55.300
Cause he stopped his car.

40:55.321 --> 40:56.598
Then let me out!

40:56.639 --> 40:58.607
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

40:58.677 --> 41:01.085
Not unless you keep your phone on.

41:06.251 --> 41:07.699
How about that?

41:07.739 --> 41:09.247
You got me on speed dial.

41:09.276 --> 41:11.336
Ok. I'm gonna park the car,

41:11.366 --> 41:12.454
and i'm gonna meet you-

41:12.455 --> 41:14.872
Hey, wait! Brenda, wait!

41:14.902 --> 41:16.801
Brenda, wait for me!

41:42.896 --> 41:45.113
It wasn't the man with the sunglasses.

41:45.153 --> 41:46.572
It was the mailman!

41:46.592 --> 41:49.350
Mailman? What mailman?

41:49.380 --> 41:50.669
What you talking about?

41:54.405 --> 41:55.903
I should've known.

41:55.973 --> 41:57.842
I should've known!

42:05.814 --> 42:08.162
Brenda, where are you?

42:08.192 --> 42:10.500
Going into the white building
across the street from the hospital.

42:10.520 --> 42:11.700
Brenda, i'm almost there.

42:11.739 --> 42:13.796
Wait for me.Wait.

42:14.976 --> 42:16.963
Hello, Fritz?

42:18.953 --> 42:20.751
Hello, Fritz?

42:20.790 --> 42:22.309
Fritz!

43:01.252 --> 43:04.449
Police. Put your weapon down.

43:07.497 --> 43:09.914
Put your hands in the air.

43:10.384 --> 43:13.061
Back away from the gun.

43:17.957 --> 43:20.594
Put your hands behind your head.

43:21.962 --> 43:23.821
Do not turn around.

43:23.881 --> 43:27.139
Do not turn around!

43:40.316 --> 43:42.275
Colonel Walter!

43:50.946 --> 43:54.772
Colonel Walter, show yourself!

43:55.851 --> 43:58.379
I know you're here.

43:58.918 --> 44:01.066
Show yourself!

44:02.765 --> 44:04.964
Colonel Walter!

44:05.342 --> 44:07.060
Oh, please.

44:07.111 --> 44:09.349
Don't leave me here.

44:09.979 --> 44:12.306
Colonel Walter.

44:12.815 --> 44:15.282
Colonel Walter.

44:15.383 --> 44:20.984
Show yourself!
