00:19.436 --> 00:22.898
I can't stop thinking about
all the life that could be out there

00:22.981 --> 00:25.275
around those distant stars.

00:25.359 --> 00:29.404
Speaking of the stars,
one of them is moving kinda funny.

00:29.488 --> 00:32.323
If it's a star,
it shouldn't be moving at all.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.910
Maybe it's Santa!

00:44.044 --> 00:46.797
Hey. It's <i>Ingenuity</i> from NASA.

00:51.677 --> 00:53.136
Don't forget to write!

00:53.762 --> 00:55.389
I wonder what it is.

00:55.931 --> 00:58.141
Maybe it's a thank-you gift from NASA.

00:58.225 --> 00:59.685
Like a muffin basket?

01:00.435 --> 01:03.814
Just imagine
how many muffins could be in there.

01:10.529 --> 01:12.322
No muffins.

01:12.406 --> 01:13.407
But--

01:14.575 --> 01:15.742
A monitor.

01:15.826 --> 01:16.827
And--

01:16.910 --> 01:20.414
This looks like the golden record
they put on the <i>Voyager</i> spacecraft.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.084
<i>Marcie's right.</i>

01:27.796 --> 01:28.839
<i>Still got it.</i>

01:29.339 --> 01:30.841
<i>Now, where was I?</i>

01:32.509 --> 01:34.970
<i>That phonograph record is an exact replica</i>

01:35.053 --> 01:37.598
<i>of the ones NASA sent
on the </i>Voyager<i> missions.</i>

01:38.682 --> 01:42.144
Voyager 1 <i>and</i> 2 were sent
<i>into space many years ago</i>

01:42.227 --> 01:45.647
<i>to explore our solar system and beyond.</i>

01:45.731 --> 01:47.524
<i>They're still out there.</i>

01:47.608 --> 01:49.860
<i>Each carries a gold-plated record</i>

01:49.943 --> 01:52.905
<i>with a goodwill message
in multiple languages,</i>

01:52.988 --> 01:58.327
<i>as well as images and sounds portraying
the diversity of life and culture on Earth</i>

01:58.911 --> 02:02.414
<i>just in case they ever cross paths
with intelligent life.</i>
<i>just in case they ever cross paths
with intelligent life.</i>

02:02.915 --> 02:05.209
<i>So, for your next mission,</i>

02:05.292 --> 02:09.170
<i>I want each of you to find
something special to put in this capsule.</i>

02:09.713 --> 02:12.508
<i>Something you think best represents
life on Earth.</i>

02:13.050 --> 02:16.094
Ingenuity <i>will bring the capsule
back to NASA,</i>

02:16.178 --> 02:20.098
<i>where it'll be put on a spacecraft
for an upcoming deep-space mission.</i>

02:20.182 --> 02:22.768
Ingenuity <i>will be back
at this time tomorrow.</i>

02:22.851 --> 02:23.852
<i>Good luck.</i>

02:25.312 --> 02:28.357
I wonder how many channels
this thing gets.

02:28.440 --> 02:30.817
You heard CARA. Let's get to it.

02:30.901 --> 02:32.361
- I know what to get.
- I've got it.

02:32.444 --> 02:33.946
- I know.
- I've got just the thing.

02:34.029 --> 02:37.032
Find something that represents
life on Earth?

02:37.115 --> 02:38.951
Where do I even start?

02:45.749 --> 02:49.336
Have you chosen what you'll put
in the space capsule, big brother?

02:49.920 --> 02:51.839
I've narrowed it down to this shirt,

02:51.922 --> 02:54.258
my Joe Shlabotnik autographed baseball

02:54.341 --> 02:55.592
or my kite.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.803
I don't see a kite.

02:57.886 --> 03:01.139
The string is all that was left
when the tree was done with it.
The string is all that was left
when the tree was done with it.

03:01.223 --> 03:03.809
I had a hard time picking one thing too.

03:03.892 --> 03:08.397
That's why I've written a letter listing
all of the things they can bring me.

03:09.231 --> 03:10.357
Good grief.

03:11.441 --> 03:13.694
I'm sending this blanket, Charlie Brown.

03:13.777 --> 03:17.781
Nothing says life on Earth
like the virtues of comfort and security.

03:20.659 --> 03:23.745
I'm surprised
you're willing to part with it, Linus.

03:24.454 --> 03:28.125
This is just a decoy I use
when my grandma comes over,

03:28.208 --> 03:29.835
in case she tries to throw it out.

03:42.431 --> 03:44.516
Well, it always fools Grandma.

03:45.225 --> 03:48.604
I'm sending this telescope
in the spirit of curiosity.

03:49.271 --> 03:51.815
If we ever do find intelligent life,

03:51.899 --> 03:54.318
they can look at us while we look at them.

04:00.449 --> 04:01.783
So, what do you think?

04:04.745 --> 04:05.746
You're right.

04:05.829 --> 04:07.206
Needs more Bubble Wrap.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.000
Hey, Chuck.

04:10.083 --> 04:13.462
I'm sending my trophy from
the regional figure skating championship.

04:13.545 --> 04:16.005
It symbolizes effort and perseverance,

04:16.089 --> 04:18.091
and that I'm a pretty good skater.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.053
As a gesture towards shared knowledge,

04:21.136 --> 04:24.014
I'm sending this complete set
of encyclopedias.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.226
I'm not sure there will be room
for all that, Marcie.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.395
You may be right, Charles.

04:30.479 --> 04:35.192
Luckily, I also have
this travel-sized edition.

04:36.151 --> 04:37.569
I'm stuck, Lucy.

04:37.653 --> 04:40.531
Everyone else has found something
to send with the capsule,

04:40.614 --> 04:42.699
but I can't think of anything
that feels right.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.743
It's simple, Charlie Brown.

04:44.826 --> 04:48.372
All you have to do
is think of the exact perfect thing.

04:48.455 --> 04:52.167
For instance, it occurred to me
that if aliens ever do get the message,

04:52.251 --> 04:54.545
they'll need to know
the right person to contact.

04:54.628 --> 04:58.173
That's why I'm sending this business card
with my phone number.

05:09.351 --> 05:12.604
How am I supposed to know
what best represents humanity?

05:13.355 --> 05:15.399
Maybe I just won't send anything.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.730
This is what you think best represents
life on Earth?

05:54.813 --> 05:57.191
They don't want your old snacks,
you silly beagle.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.156
<i>Is that everything?</i>

06:04.239 --> 06:06.909
Not quite. Charlie Brown isn't here yet.

06:06.992 --> 06:09.244
That blockhead
probably never did think of anything.

06:09.328 --> 06:10.621
Wait!

06:12.789 --> 06:14.458
I found it.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.793
Just the right thing for the capsule.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.510
Charlie Brown,
that's not even a good picture.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.845
It might not be perfect,

06:26.929 --> 06:29.973
but it shows us together
with the people we care about.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.434
And what could be more human than that?

06:39.149 --> 06:41.610
<i>I promised myself I wouldn't cry.</i>

06:42.569 --> 06:43.779
<i>Incoming!</i>

06:47.366 --> 06:48.992
<i>Great job, gang.</i>

06:49.743 --> 06:51.411
<i>Until next time!</i>

06:53.372 --> 06:56.083
- Charlie Brown.
- Yes?

06:56.166 --> 06:57.167
That pictureâ€¦

06:58.043 --> 06:59.253
Yes?

06:59.336 --> 07:02.130
Those aliens are going to think
you're a genius.
Those aliens are going to think
you're a genius.

07:10.347 --> 07:12.558
Well, there goes our capsule.

07:12.641 --> 07:16.979
It's humbling to think we might be
some far-off civilization's first window

07:17.062 --> 07:18.689
into life on Earth.

07:18.772 --> 07:22.401
I just realized
I can never change my phone number!

07:22.484 --> 07:24.945
Hey, everyone. I'm getting something.

07:26.154 --> 07:28.490
Another signal from deep space?

07:28.574 --> 07:30.409
Nope. This.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.469
<i>CARA in space.</i>

07:49.553 --> 07:51.805
<i>I'm gonna see the moon.</i>
