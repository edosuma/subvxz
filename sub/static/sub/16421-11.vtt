It was a pink barrette.

00:02.919 --> 00:06.464
Not too big, not too small,
just the perfect size.

00:06.589 --> 00:08.216
You have 100 of those.

00:08.299 --> 00:11.428
99 now. I can't have an odd number.

00:13.888 --> 00:16.808
98, even number, problem solved.

-Mr. Finn?
-What's up?

00:26.901 --> 00:28.862
Why are you pretending to be a lion?

00:29.070 --> 00:32.365
I'm not. I'm just frustrated,
I got this big test

00:32.449 --> 00:36.619
for my teacher certification class coming
up and I can't find a good place to study.

00:36.870 --> 00:39.456
You know there's a library like,
10 feet that way?

00:39.539 --> 00:41.624
Mmm-hmm. I'm not allowed in there anymore.

00:42.041 --> 00:48.840
Apparently the Librarian's not a huge fan
of AC/DC or air guitar that gets violent.

00:49.549 --> 00:51.634
Oh, studying is my favourite thing.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.595
Besides pop-quizzes,

00:53.678 --> 00:56.014
they're like surprise parties
for people who studied.

00:57.640 --> 01:00.310
I just can't learn McGovern's stages
of learning.

01:01.436 --> 01:03.855
Oh no, I've got to go to night school
in an hour.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.066
Mr. Finn, you're not wearing a watch.

01:06.149 --> 01:09.819
I know, but it says here,
"Go to night school in an hour."

01:10.320 --> 01:12.197
Oh no, when did I write that?

01:15.784 --> 01:17.869
You know you can put reminders
in your phone.

01:18.328 --> 01:19.621
Great idea.

01:21.289 --> 01:24.083
"Put things in phone."

01:26.044 --> 01:30.465
Mr. Finn, if you don't pass this test,
then you won't be able to pass the class,

01:30.548 --> 01:32.258
then you won't be able
to be our teacher anymore

01:32.342 --> 01:33.718
and then that's the end of the band.

01:34.010 --> 01:39.265
I know that! It's written right here.
You know what?

01:39.349 --> 01:43.436
It's no use, I'm never going
to pass that test. I should quit.

01:43.520 --> 01:47.106
No, you can't quit, you just need help
and I'm going to need you

01:47.190 --> 01:48.858
to hand over all your pens.

01:55.657 --> 01:56.991
All of them.

02:04.791 --> 02:08.253
For the good of the band,
Tomika and I will teach you how to study.

02:08.545 --> 02:11.548
-Really?
-I taught my cat how to play ping pong.

02:11.714 --> 02:13.633
You can't be that much harder to teach.

02:16.427 --> 02:19.639
With you guys helping me,
nothing's going to stop me from learning.

02:19.806 --> 02:22.934
-Then let's get to work right now.
-Perfect, we are going to hit it so hard.

02:23.017 --> 02:24.018

Woah, face plant. That's a tough way
to get 35 million views.

Is that the skater
who ate concrete trying a 360 fakie?

02:37.282 --> 02:39.117
I could totally land that trick.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.327
Okay, I dare you.

02:41.411 --> 02:44.455
[faking a voice]
Or we can just focus on our studies.

02:45.790 --> 02:49.168
Who said that? That's a good idea.

02:50.128 --> 02:52.046

Don't listen to them.
Are you going to do it or not?

02:57.302 --> 03:01.389
What am I? Six? I'm not going
to do something just because you dare me.

yesterday I got to thinking,

03:47.769 --> 03:50.063
cars have airbags, why can't we?

03:50.146 --> 03:53.274
May I present the Trouble Bubble 9,000.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.318
It's a bubble for when you're in trouble.

03:56.569 --> 03:59.155
Um, I don't see any bubble, Lawrence.

-Trouble Bubble, activate!
-Woah, it's voice activated?

12:21.365 --> 12:22.366
on your yacht.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.994
I can't go on a yacht, I'll get seasick.

12:25.369 --> 12:29.081
Look, you're the scientist,
but I'm the business guy.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.041
Trust me, I have a subtle touch.

12:31.208 --> 12:34.587
Now lift your other arm up,
we'll put a falcon on it.

12:35.504 --> 12:38.757
Wow, I've never been the president
of a company before.

12:39.216 --> 12:42.386
I think I should call it Lawrence Co.

12:43.512 --> 12:46.765
Actually, it's Lawrence,
a division of Kwon Co.

12:47.975 --> 12:52.438
I feel like you're taking something
that's mine and making it yours.

12:52.521 --> 12:55.107
No, no! I'm making it ours.

12:55.191 --> 12:58.736
You're a big part of the team,
you've got your own division.

13:00.779 --> 13:02.531
I still get to go to Wiz World, right?

13:02.740 --> 13:03.991
Let me worry about Wiz World.

13:04.116 --> 13:07.119
-I want a straight yes or no.
-Who wouldn't?

13:07.411 --> 13:09.246
I feel like you're giving me
the run-around.

13:09.580 --> 13:12.541
Good point. Let me get back to you
on that after lunch.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.378
Woah.

13:18.005 --> 13:19.298
And you are?

13:19.882 --> 13:23.802
Um, I'm Lawrence, I sit here every day
with my friend Zack and Freddy.

13:24.345 --> 13:26.347
You interviewed me like three hours ago.

13:27.389 --> 13:29.600
Yeah, sorry, I don't see you on the list.

13:30.142 --> 13:33.437
But, I'm a big part of the team.
I've got my own division.

13:34.730 --> 13:36.565
I look like Ryan Gosling!

13:37.816 --> 13:38.859
Zack?

13:46.909 --> 13:50.287
-Zack, why am I not allowed in?
-Sorry about this, Mr. Kwon.

13:50.788 --> 13:53.582
Want me to have security escort
this gentlemen out?

13:53.666 --> 13:57.127
That won't be necessary, Asher,
but stay close.

13:57.628 --> 14:00.214
Sorry, buddy, I'm having a meeting
with the boys in marketing.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.216
Who are the boys in marketing?

14:04.885 --> 14:07.346
You are so lucky you don't have
to deal with the boring business

14:07.429 --> 14:09.098
side of things. It's a spread sheets--

14:09.431 --> 14:11.267
Is that an onion ring tower?

14:12.643 --> 14:14.770
If you order enough sliders
the tower comes free.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.482
-Look, you think I want this stuff?
-Yes.

14:18.691 --> 14:22.194
Okay, yeah, I do, but I'm just trying
to run a great business,

14:22.278 --> 14:26.323
which is all about looking like a success
and I think I'm doing a good job.

14:26.407 --> 14:28.409
I mean,
you want to get back here don't you?

14:28.492 --> 14:30.411
-Yes!
-See?

14:30.494 --> 14:32.288
-Hey, Lawrence.
-He gets in?

14:32.496 --> 14:34.415
You're value is way up,
check out the Lawrence app.

14:36.083 --> 14:39.795
If my value is going up then
I want my money for Wiz World now!

14:39.962 --> 14:43.674
And I want to give it to you,
I do, but I just don't have it.

14:43.757 --> 14:45.217
What do you mean you don't have it?

14:45.301 --> 14:47.011
What about all the money
from the investors?

14:47.261 --> 14:48.679
It's all tied up in the business.

14:49.096 --> 14:50.890
But, it's Wiz World opening day.

14:51.098 --> 14:52.683
I even brought my wand from home.

14:53.100 --> 14:56.228
Well, you and your stick will just have
to wait until after the science fair.

14:56.520 --> 15:00.232
No, that wasn't our deal. I'm done,
I want out of the company.

15:00.608 --> 15:04.320
You can't get out, you signed a contract
and we've got investors.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.947
Then I'll give everyone their money back.

15:07.489 --> 15:10.701
Look at the Lawrence app,
your price is way up here,

15:11.035 --> 15:13.454
-you can't afford to buy yourself back.
-But--

15:13.537 --> 15:15.164
I really have to get back to my meeting.

15:16.874 --> 15:18.167
That's it.

15:18.667 --> 15:25.299
Zack, I command you,
get me my Wiz World money. Ala-kazam!

15:27.259 --> 15:28.260
[sighing]

15:29.720 --> 15:34.475
-You will get me a onion ring.
-Not going to happen.

15:38.520 --> 15:42.399
You're more likely to retain information
if you engage both intellectually

15:42.483 --> 15:43.484
and physically.

15:43.817 --> 15:45.444
It's called action learning.

15:45.819 --> 15:50.324
Or as we professional educators say,
climbing a kick-butt rock wall

15:50.407 --> 15:51.450
to get your learn on.

15:52.993 --> 15:56.080
As you can see, we've place
the eight stages of learning on the wall.

15:57.915 --> 15:59.083
Oh jeez.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.003
It's kind of high. Um,
I think I can read them now.

16:03.087 --> 16:09.635
Mmm-- re-- ah-- regers-- er--
em-- er-- egots-- ah-- supupus.

16:09.718 --> 16:12.680
Got it! I'm going to ace this test.
See ya!

16:14.640 --> 16:16.475
Or we can hang out here.

16:17.726 --> 16:20.437
Trust us, Mr. Finn, this is going to work.

16:20.521 --> 16:23.315
Once you've reached the top,
you'll have learned all eight stages.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.693
Unless you fall, then it's splat city.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.738
Come on, Mr. Finn, let's get vertical!

16:36.829 --> 16:38.122
[panting]

16:38.580 --> 16:41.667
Stage one, resistance. I did it!

16:42.001 --> 16:44.878
Way to go, Mr. Finn.
Isn't it fun learning through action?

16:45.212 --> 16:48.716
It sure is. I think I'm about
to action in my pants.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.051
[panting]

16:53.345 --> 16:55.472
Oh! Ah!

16:58.392 --> 16:59.435
Relax, Mr. Finn.

16:59.518 --> 17:02.187
As long as you lock down
your carabiner you'll be okay.

17:02.354 --> 17:04.690
Oh, thank goodness. Lock down my what?

17:04.857 --> 17:06.358
[shrieking, thudding]

17:09.820 --> 17:11.739
-Mr. Finn, are you okay?
-Hang on.

17:12.072 --> 17:14.283
I'm watching my life flash before my eyes.

17:15.784 --> 17:17.703
I have not done a lot.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.875
I can't believe it's the big day.

17:23.125 --> 17:24.835
Hope your science fair invention lives up
to the hype.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.421
I think you guys are going to be pleased.

17:29.006 --> 17:30.049
[excited gasping]

17:30.340 --> 17:33.886
[Lawrence] Gentlemen,
I give you the Mobile Breakfast Maker.

17:33.969 --> 17:35.721
It makes breakfast in an instant.

17:36.013 --> 17:41.477
Toast, pancakes, bacon, fried eggs,
waffles, hash browns and home fries.

17:41.643 --> 17:44.229
Both potato options? I love science.

17:45.647 --> 17:48.025
[Zack]
Dude, I'm really glad you came around.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.319
Why don't I give you a sneak preview?

17:50.402 --> 17:52.738
[buzzing]

17:54.364 --> 17:57.534
[shrieking]

17:59.495 --> 18:01.955
Oh no! This is a disaster!

18:02.081 --> 18:05.250
[shrieking]

18:05.334 --> 18:07.127
Who did this?

18:07.336 --> 18:09.004
[boy] It's Lawrence's invention!

18:09.254 --> 18:11.757
I want out of the Lawrence business!

18:11.924 --> 18:13.801
Me too, I want my money back!

18:14.134 --> 18:16.261
Look, Lawrence's prices dropped.

18:19.515 --> 18:22.351
Um, Asher, put up the velvet rope.

18:22.518 --> 18:24.728
Nope, y'all don't pay me enough
for this. Out!

18:26.939 --> 18:31.443
Guys, there's nothing you can do
to make me feel worse than I already do.

18:31.735 --> 18:32.903
Get him!

18:34.404 --> 18:36.406
[shrieking]

18:42.246 --> 18:46.750
Get into my brains. Get into my brains.

18:47.876 --> 18:49.920
Please get in my brain.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.588
Hey, guys.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.634
Mr. Finn, we're working on a song
and we need your help.

18:55.968 --> 19:00.139
Now that I can do. Why do you guys got?
Lay it on me.

19:00.472 --> 19:03.183
This is a little ditty called "Stages."

19:04.143 --> 19:06.812
♪ McGovern had this crazy theory ♪

19:06.979 --> 19:09.398
♪ All eight stages made me weary ♪

19:09.481 --> 19:12.985
♪ So, we put all words into a song ♪

19:13.318 --> 19:15.821
Stage one, resistance.

19:17.531 --> 19:22.786
♪ I don't wanna, no, no,
I don't wanna, no ♪

19:23.537 --> 19:26.331
Stage two, procrastination.

19:29.877 --> 19:35.007
♪ Maybe later, alligator,

19:35.090 --> 19:37.009
I see what you guys are doing.

19:38.093 --> 19:40.762

19:40.846 --> 19:44.057

19:44.183 --> 19:45.601
Guys, this is great.

19:45.684 --> 19:49.980
I'm totally going to pass my test.
You guys are geniuses.

19:50.063 --> 19:52.399
Well, actually,
we just realised the best way

19:52.482 --> 19:54.359
to teach you is the way you teach us.

19:54.443 --> 19:57.196
[Finn] You're right, I'm the geniuses.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.247
Gentlemen.

20:07.539 --> 20:10.584
It's all gone, all the money.

20:11.210 --> 20:14.004
Lawrence,
you're only worth ten dollars now.

20:14.087 --> 20:15.422
Total fail.

20:15.756 --> 20:19.593
Fail, or my most brilliant plan yet?

20:21.053 --> 20:25.057
Here's ten dollars.
I'm buying the company.

20:25.766 --> 20:28.185
So, you did this on purpose?

20:28.268 --> 20:33.440
Yup, and now I'm the sole owner
of Lawrence, a division of Lawrence.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.486
I guess I kind of got carried away.

20:37.569 --> 20:42.199
-You enslaved me!
-Yes, in chains of admiration and respect.

20:43.742 --> 20:47.162
Look, I'm really sorry, okay?

20:47.412 --> 20:50.123
I guess I have a lot to learn
about being a good business man

20:50.415 --> 20:52.668
and even more on being a good friend.

20:52.876 --> 20:56.380
And, sorry you had to fail the
science fair just to teach us a lesson.

20:56.588 --> 20:59.675
Oh, I'm going to win the science fair.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.095
[beeping]

21:06.098 --> 21:07.182
It works?

21:07.266 --> 21:10.477
[Lawrence] Of course it works,
I built in a sabotage mode.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.896
You really think I'd
throw the science fair?

21:12.980 --> 21:16.441
Ha! I live for the science fair.

21:17.025 --> 21:18.277
That's smart.

21:18.485 --> 21:21.905
If you hadn't just destroyed
my corporation I'd hire you in a second.

21:22.447 --> 21:25.033
And guess what the prize
for the science fair is?

21:25.117 --> 21:27.577
A one year pass to Wiz World.

21:29.871 --> 21:32.624
Uh, nice look, Zack.

21:33.041 --> 21:36.712
-Very rock and roll.
-Can I interest you ladies in a--

21:37.671 --> 21:39.631
strawberry crepe?

21:41.008 --> 21:42.551
You had me at--

21:45.721 --> 21:50.058
-Hey, sweet machine. What does it do?
-It makes breakfast.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.978
Perfect,
all this studying's making me hungry.

21:53.061 --> 21:55.731
Oh, "sabotagey," sound delicious.

21:55.814 --> 21:57.482
No, Mr. Finn! Not that button!

21:57.816 --> 21:59.609
[shrieking]

22:01.570 --> 22:06.575
