WEBVTT

00:01.250 --> 00:03.958
In order to master
the ways of the Force,

00:04.042 --> 00:07.042
Jedi must forego all attachment.

00:07.125 --> 00:09.292
THE MANDALORIAN:
That is the opposite of our Creed.

00:09.375 --> 00:12.500
Loyalty and solidarity are the way.

00:12.583 --> 00:15.583
What shall I forge
for the foundling Grogu?

00:21.167 --> 00:23.167
Welcome to the Sanctuary.

00:23.250 --> 00:27.458
I'm just here to introduce myself
and assure you that your business

00:27.542 --> 00:31.083
will continue to thrive
under my watchful eye.

00:31.167 --> 00:33.000
As I'm sure you all know,

00:33.083 --> 00:35.875
the Pyke Syndicate
are mustering troops in Mos Espa.

00:35.958 --> 00:40.417
They have slowly absorbed our planet
as part of their spice trade.

00:40.500 --> 00:42.542
How much treasure do we have in reserve?

00:42.625 --> 00:46.875
I have plenty of credits.
What I'm short on is muscle.

00:48.667 --> 00:49.792
Boba Fett.

00:49.875 --> 00:51.667
He sure would appreciate it.

00:51.750 --> 00:53.708
THE MANDALORIAN:
Tell him it's on the house.

00:54.542 --> 00:58.000
But first, I gotta pay a visit
to a little friend.

01:43.583 --> 01:44.958
It's all there.

01:45.042 --> 01:48.125
We'll leave the spice
and take the credits back to Mos Eisley.

01:48.208 --> 01:49.750
The rest will follow.

01:49.875 --> 01:52.042
Do you know
where you are, gentlemen?

01:53.625 --> 01:54.750
Think it through.

02:00.417 --> 02:03.750
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt
being you're not from around here

02:03.833 --> 02:06.458
and say you figured
you're in the middle of nowhere.

02:06.542 --> 02:08.500
But everything out there

02:09.292 --> 02:11.625
to everything out there

02:13.625 --> 02:16.042
is the Mos Pelgo territories,

02:17.042 --> 02:21.292
and these stripes indicate
I'm the marshal of said territories.

02:21.958 --> 02:25.750
Now, I don't know what arrangements
you have with the authorities in Mos Espa,

02:25.833 --> 02:28.167
and let's be honest,
in Mos Eisley, anything goes,

02:28.250 --> 02:31.583
but out here I'm the one
tells folks what to do.

02:37.917 --> 02:40.167
I didn't see what's in that chest,

02:40.250 --> 02:42.250
and consequently no laws have been broken

02:42.333 --> 02:43.708
far as I'm concerned.

02:44.708 --> 02:47.542
If you gentlemen load up your wares
and head back to where you came,

02:47.625 --> 02:50.875
we can chalk this one up
to you guys reading the map wrong.

03:00.583 --> 03:01.667
Think it through.

03:13.583 --> 03:15.500
I can see you're the smart one.

03:17.875 --> 03:19.792
I got a proposition for your bosses.

03:21.417 --> 03:25.833
Tell 'em I've heard of the Syndicate.
Take their credits back with you.

03:25.917 --> 03:28.375
And I say this with respect,

03:28.458 --> 03:33.667
anyone gets lost running spice through
Mos Pelgo again will be lost forever.

03:36.042 --> 03:41.250
Now, load that chest and go.
Consider it a fine for trespassing.

03:42.333 --> 03:44.375
It's worth more than your town.

03:45.125 --> 03:47.417
Well, then, maybe I'll retire.

06:02.875 --> 06:04.125
Hello, friend.

06:05.625 --> 06:07.542
I'm looking for Skywalker.

06:11.875 --> 06:14.250
I came to see the kid, Grogu.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.167
Is this where they are?

07:51.333 --> 07:53.125
Hey. Droid.

07:55.917 --> 07:56.917
Hey.

07:58.833 --> 08:00.500
Don't shut off. Wake up.

08:12.625 --> 08:15.125
Hey, I'm looking for Skywalker.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.583
He had a kid with him.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.250
Is that a bench?

08:23.000 --> 08:24.708
How long will I be waiting?

08:26.333 --> 08:27.750
Is anyone here?

08:29.292 --> 08:30.917
Anyone alive?

10:10.083 --> 10:11.375
Grogu.

11:45.625 --> 11:47.208
All right, let's go for a walk.

11:59.750 --> 12:03.083
I want to tell you about someone
you remind me of a great deal.

12:05.708 --> 12:07.083
His name was Yoda.

12:08.250 --> 12:12.000
He was small like you,
but his heart was huge,

12:12.083 --> 12:14.000
and the Force was strong in him.

12:16.417 --> 12:17.833
He once said to me,

12:19.375 --> 12:21.042
"Size matters not."

12:25.500 --> 12:27.083
That's how he talked.

12:28.875 --> 12:30.542
He would speak in riddles.

12:32.708 --> 12:35.292
Have you heard anyone
talk like that back home?

12:40.208 --> 12:42.083
Do you remember back home?

12:50.542 --> 12:52.167
Would you like to remember?

12:59.500 --> 13:01.833
Let me help you remember.

13:46.583 --> 13:48.375
- Go! Go! Go!
- Hurry! Hurry! Move! Move it!

13:57.417 --> 13:58.875
Welcome back.

14:02.792 --> 14:05.500
The galaxy is a dangerous place, Grogu.

14:08.583 --> 14:11.125
I will teach you to protect yourself.

14:37.917 --> 14:41.458
You.
I didn't expect to see you here.

14:44.042 --> 14:45.708
I'm an old friend of the family.

14:46.792 --> 14:49.083
I thought you weren't
going to help train Grogu.

14:49.667 --> 14:52.250
I'm not. Master Luke is.

14:53.458 --> 14:55.125
Then what are you doing here?

14:56.083 --> 14:57.875
That's my question for you.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.333
I'm here to see the kid.

15:02.667 --> 15:05.417
That's why R2 brought you to me instead.

15:10.375 --> 15:11.500
What is this place?

15:14.625 --> 15:16.500
There's nothing now,

15:16.583 --> 15:19.042
but will someday be a great school.

15:21.333 --> 15:23.042
Grogu will be its first student.

15:24.750 --> 15:26.375
I'd like to know how he's doing.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.250
He is doing fine.

15:33.583 --> 15:34.708
I wanna see him.

15:40.792 --> 15:42.042
I know you do.

15:43.542 --> 15:45.125
Let us take a walk.

15:57.125 --> 15:58.750
I warned you when we met

15:59.625 --> 16:02.333
that your attachment to Grogu
would be difficult to let go of.

16:03.708 --> 16:06.417
He was a Mandalorian foundling in my care.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.250
I just wanna make sure he's safe.

16:08.958 --> 16:12.708
There is no place in the galaxy
more safe than here with Luke.

16:14.625 --> 16:17.500
I don't understand why you're all right
with Skywalker's decision

16:17.583 --> 16:19.292
to train the kid when you wouldn't.

16:24.500 --> 16:26.083
Because it was his choice.

16:27.250 --> 16:29.125
I don't control the wants of others.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.958
Then, it's my choice to go and see him.

16:34.250 --> 16:37.958
Of course. If that is what you wish.

16:48.250 --> 16:49.250
All right.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.542
Are you doing this for Grogu,
or are you doing this for yourself?

16:56.167 --> 16:59.167
I just... I wanna give him this.

17:00.708 --> 17:03.375
Why? So he will remember you?

17:04.458 --> 17:05.458
No.

17:06.375 --> 17:10.792
As a Mandalorian foundling,
he should have this. It's his right.

17:14.750 --> 17:15.833
Foundling.

17:17.208 --> 17:18.917
Perhaps he is a Padawan now.

17:26.542 --> 17:31.792
Well, either way,
this armor will protect him.

17:39.750 --> 17:40.833
If you are set on it,

17:42.000 --> 17:43.417
then allow me to deliver it.

17:47.750 --> 17:49.208
I came all this way.

17:50.667 --> 17:51.833
He's right there.

17:58.375 --> 18:00.375
Grogu misses you a great deal.

18:02.667 --> 18:03.958
If he sees you,

18:06.333 --> 18:08.708
it will only make things
more difficult for him.

18:29.292 --> 18:31.000
Make sure he's protected.

19:25.458 --> 19:28.667
All right.
It's time to continue your training.

19:38.875 --> 19:40.083
Let's see you jump.

19:44.625 --> 19:47.208
Really? That's all you got?

19:51.500 --> 19:55.167
Bend down, jump, and as you do,

19:55.667 --> 19:58.292
feel the Force flow through you.

20:07.917 --> 20:09.250
You're trying too hard.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.750
Don't try. Do.

20:19.083 --> 20:21.417
Come on. I want to show you something.

20:34.042 --> 20:36.542
Hang on.

21:02.792 --> 21:06.792
Look. The wide world exists in balance.

21:08.542 --> 21:11.167
Feel the Force all around you.

21:21.500 --> 21:25.750
Through the Force,
you will find balance as well.

21:33.417 --> 21:34.542
Concentrate.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.375
Use the Force.

21:57.333 --> 21:58.500
That's it.

22:00.500 --> 22:01.583
Very good.

22:04.667 --> 22:05.750
Better.

22:42.833 --> 22:44.500
This is a training remote.

22:45.708 --> 22:47.333
It will test your reflexes.

22:59.042 --> 23:00.625
No, that isn't how it works.

23:08.250 --> 23:09.750
This is how it works.

23:27.958 --> 23:31.333
Get back up. Always get back up.

23:43.583 --> 23:45.167
Very good.

24:43.750 --> 24:45.000
Good.

24:46.917 --> 24:48.292
You've taught him well.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.625
It's more like he's remembering
than I'm actually teaching him anything.

24:57.542 --> 25:00.292
Sometimes the student
guides the master.

25:06.792 --> 25:08.375
The Mandalorian was here.

25:09.708 --> 25:11.208
As I told you.

25:12.875 --> 25:14.792
The two share a strong bond,

25:15.958 --> 25:19.167
and he brought him a gift.

25:33.292 --> 25:35.583
Sometimes I wonder if his heart is in it.

25:38.583 --> 25:40.208
So much like your father.

25:51.500 --> 25:53.000
What should I do about him?

25:55.708 --> 25:57.042
Trust your instincts.

26:05.708 --> 26:07.125
Will I see you again?

26:09.625 --> 26:10.667
Perhaps.

26:13.083 --> 26:15.083
May the Force be with you.

27:30.833 --> 27:33.250
I'm here at the request of Fennec Shand.

27:43.083 --> 27:47.125
The Pyke Syndicate has been gathering
soldiers the last few weeks.

27:47.792 --> 27:51.292
Mayor Mok Shaiz is on their payroll
and has flown off world,

27:51.375 --> 27:55.792
which leads us to believe
the storm is about to break.

27:55.875 --> 27:58.917
It was a scheduled vacation, actually.

28:05.792 --> 28:09.708
Here's a map of where they are gathering,
based on whispers.

28:11.542 --> 28:15.625
The three crime families of Mos Espa
seem willing to lay low

28:15.708 --> 28:19.125
and let the Pykes move on our territory.

28:20.917 --> 28:23.417
This is the Mandalorian, Din Djarin.

28:24.750 --> 28:26.708
Thanks to him and Krrsantan,

28:26.792 --> 28:30.542
we now have enough experienced muscle
to act as enforcers.

28:30.625 --> 28:33.875
The Mods have done a thorough job
of surveying the streets,

28:33.958 --> 28:39.792
but we lack the numbers to cover
our territory if an all-out war comes.

28:40.792 --> 28:42.333
We need foot soldiers.

28:43.167 --> 28:45.125
THE MANDALORIAN:
I might be able to help with that.

29:45.333 --> 29:48.583
You want to park your starship,
you got to do it out there in the flats.

29:49.458 --> 29:51.417
I'm looking for Marshal Vanth.

29:53.208 --> 29:55.125
I don't think you heard what I said.

29:55.958 --> 29:58.458
- I heard you.
- I'll take it from here, Deputy.

30:13.250 --> 30:14.250
He's new.

30:15.083 --> 30:17.542
Still a bit jumpy.
Is that a Naboo starfighter?

30:18.667 --> 30:20.542
That's what it started off as.

30:23.292 --> 30:26.625
Haven't seen you since you gave up
your armor. How have you been?

30:26.750 --> 30:29.500
More careful. Where's the little guy?

30:30.250 --> 30:31.792
Back with his own folk.

30:32.833 --> 30:33.875
That's too bad.

30:34.875 --> 30:37.333
I guess we both lost something
we were fond of.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.583
Can I buy you a drink?

30:52.292 --> 30:55.208
I still don't see
what all that's got to do with me.

30:56.083 --> 30:57.583
I need you to lead a garrison.

30:59.250 --> 31:00.542
Your people are good fighters,

31:00.625 --> 31:02.875
and there's plenty of credits
in it for them too.

31:05.750 --> 31:07.792
The peace is intact, Mando.

31:07.958 --> 31:11.000
We took out that dragon.
My people don't want to fight no more.

31:11.083 --> 31:16.250
Your town might be good for now,
but it's all part of the same planet.

31:16.375 --> 31:17.917
We need good people to step up

31:18.000 --> 31:20.500
or the spice is bound
to come through these parts.

31:21.583 --> 31:23.625
As long as I'm here, that's not a problem,

31:24.958 --> 31:28.792
so why should they risk their lives
for this Boba Fett?

31:28.875 --> 31:31.792
Mos Pelgo might be good right now...

31:31.875 --> 31:32.875
Freetown.

31:33.958 --> 31:35.000
What?

31:35.583 --> 31:37.000
It's called Freetown now.

31:37.083 --> 31:39.583
We changed the name. Suits us better.

31:39.667 --> 31:43.833
Well, I fought side-by-side
with the citizens of Freetown,

31:43.917 --> 31:45.583
and they're brave people,

31:45.667 --> 31:48.500
and the Pyke Syndicate has us outnumbered,
and we need your help.

31:48.583 --> 31:50.292
The town wants no part of it.

31:50.375 --> 31:52.625
That's a city folk fight.

31:57.667 --> 32:00.208
Is that what you say too, Marshal?

32:02.125 --> 32:04.458
We're square, you and me.

32:05.833 --> 32:10.500
Yes, we are. But I didn't think
you were one to back down from bullies.

32:11.208 --> 32:13.167
COBB VANTH:
See, that's what I like about you, Mando.

32:13.250 --> 32:16.375
That big smile of yours
lets you get away with anything.

32:20.542 --> 32:24.500
There's no easy way to ask for a favor.

32:30.083 --> 32:31.917
I'll tell you what.

32:33.500 --> 32:35.167
Things are tough around here,

32:36.792 --> 32:38.625
but I'll see what I can do.

32:54.583 --> 32:55.583
Get the word out.

32:55.667 --> 32:59.833
I want all men and women of fighting age
to come to town. I want to have a meeting.

33:00.708 --> 33:02.958
It's not our problem, Marshal.

33:03.042 --> 33:05.917
No, but it might be,
after they hear what I'm gonna say.

33:35.292 --> 33:38.000
- Hey, Jo.
- Afternoon, Marshal.

33:38.167 --> 33:41.833
Do me a favor and tell these people
to head inside for a spell.

33:43.792 --> 33:45.125
Is something wrong, Marshal?

33:46.500 --> 33:50.000
I hope not.
Just rather err on the side of safety.

34:03.167 --> 34:06.458
- Go on. Go, go, go.
- Let's go. Quickly.

34:10.958 --> 34:12.375
What's going on, boss?

34:13.417 --> 34:15.292
Let me handle this, Deputy.

34:20.167 --> 34:22.125
I'm not leaving you out here alone.

34:22.208 --> 34:23.375
Get inside.

34:45.708 --> 34:47.375
Cobb Vanth.

34:50.375 --> 34:51.875
And who might you be?

35:00.667 --> 35:05.125
Whatever Fett is paying you, we'll match,

35:05.250 --> 35:10.250
and all you've got to do is stay put
and let things play out.

35:11.458 --> 35:13.250
Hey, the Marshal ain't for sale.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.250
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.

35:43.417 --> 35:49.083
I'd be careful where I was
sticking my nose if I were you.

35:54.667 --> 35:57.250
Is that friendly advice or a threat?

36:05.708 --> 36:11.500
Boba Fett is a cold-blooded killer
who worked with the Empire.

36:15.833 --> 36:18.958
You tell your spice runners
Tatooine is closed for business.

36:20.042 --> 36:22.667
This planet's seen enough violence.

36:25.792 --> 36:29.042
You should've never given up your armor.

37:27.667 --> 37:30.750
Tatooine belongs to the Syndicate.

37:31.875 --> 37:34.542
As long as the spice keeps running,

37:35.333 --> 37:37.875
everyone will be left alone.

37:44.458 --> 37:46.208
Hey, hey! Over here!

37:46.292 --> 37:47.542
Come on. Somebody get him.

37:47.625 --> 37:50.000
We need some help!
Can someone call the doctor?

37:51.708 --> 37:52.708
Get a medpac!

37:52.792 --> 37:53.833
Is he okay?

37:53.917 --> 37:54.917
Grab the stims.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
The Marshal, is he breathing?

37:58.458 --> 38:00.333
- Come on, get him! Get him!

38:00.417 --> 38:03.708
There's something wrong
with the Marshal! Somebody help!

38:03.792 --> 38:05.292
Come on! Bring him inside!

38:39.208 --> 38:40.750
Might I get you something?

38:57.417 --> 38:59.167
Can we take your helmets for a cleaning?

39:04.708 --> 39:05.708
Excuse me.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
Nothing.

39:15.292 --> 39:16.750
Oh! Excuse me.

39:29.833 --> 39:32.625
Oh, wait! You forgot your camtono.

40:22.542 --> 40:25.083
The Mandalorian wanted you to have this.

40:32.750 --> 40:34.250
But before you take it,

40:35.292 --> 40:36.917
I will give you a choice.

40:45.292 --> 40:46.292
This...

40:47.667 --> 40:49.167
is a lightsaber.

40:53.792 --> 40:56.792
It belonged to my teacher, Master Yoda.

40:59.708 --> 41:00.792
And now,

41:02.042 --> 41:03.917
I'm offering it to you.

41:12.167 --> 41:14.208
But you may choose only one.

41:16.292 --> 41:20.250
If you choose the armor, you'll return
to your friend, the Mandalorian.

41:21.375 --> 41:24.750
However, you will be giving in
to attachment to those that you love

41:24.833 --> 41:27.625
and forsaking the way of the Jedi.

41:28.625 --> 41:30.458
But if you choose the lightsaber,

41:30.542 --> 41:32.917
you will be the first student
in my academy,

41:33.000 --> 41:36.750
and I will train you to be a great Jedi.

41:38.208 --> 41:41.750
It will take you many years
to master the ways of the Force,

41:41.917 --> 41:44.667
and you may never see
the Mandalorian again

41:45.750 --> 41:51.500
because, Grogu, a short time for you
is a lifetime for someone else.

42:07.333 --> 42:08.667
Which do you choose?
