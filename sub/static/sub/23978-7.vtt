01:30.173 --> 01:31.841
I always hated Florida.

01:33.218 --> 01:36.805
But our marriage counselor
suggested the trip.

01:37.722 --> 01:40.892
She said it would be
a bonding opportunity.

01:42.602 --> 01:43.812
In a split second,

01:45.355 --> 01:46.898
I lost everyone.

01:49.901 --> 01:51.152
I lost myself.

02:15.552 --> 02:18.263
Oh, welcome back to the world, sugar.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.891
Strong heart. That's good.

02:22.851 --> 02:24.310
Doctor's on his way.

02:32.610 --> 02:35.238
Oh, honey, you need to lie down.

02:37.782 --> 02:39.409
Now, come on, it's late.

02:39.492 --> 02:41.995
You're gonna need lots of rest.
Doctor's orders.

02:46.207 --> 02:49.169
Oh, God...

02:49.252 --> 02:50.879
Try to stay calm for me.

02:51.588 --> 02:54.132
What have you done to me?

02:54.215 --> 02:57.677
You're all right.
You even standing here is a miracle.

02:58.303 --> 03:01.055
Now, come on, let's get you back to bed.

03:03.516 --> 03:04.684
God in heaven!

03:20.074 --> 03:22.619
Get away from me!

03:37.133 --> 03:38.133
Alisa!

03:38.801 --> 03:41.721
Alisa, no. Stop.

03:42.472 --> 03:43.473
No!

03:46.851 --> 03:47.851
That's Jessica.

03:48.853 --> 03:50.104
You don't wanna hurt her.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.946
I'll make this better. I can fix it.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.828
Look at how far she's come.
It's unreal.

04:05.912 --> 04:08.831
Well, she's not attacking people.
That's progress.

04:08.915 --> 04:12.043
It's more than progress.
We're talking major breakthrough.

04:12.126 --> 04:14.045
Until something angers her.

04:14.128 --> 04:18.091
- Why do we keep putting her through this?
- Because we are so close.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.803
Look, everything has a risk.

04:21.886 --> 04:25.598
Once I figure out a drug protocol
and an effective behavioral therapy,

04:25.682 --> 04:26.683
she'll be...

04:33.064 --> 04:34.065
You're back.

04:35.733 --> 04:36.776
How you feeling?

04:37.777 --> 04:39.279
Pretty strung out, right?

04:42.448 --> 04:43.992
You remember who I am?

04:45.994 --> 04:46.995
That's cool.

04:47.620 --> 04:50.832
You've been unconscious for a while.
Memory loss is normal.

04:51.791 --> 04:54.210
I'm Karl Malus. I'm your doctor.

04:54.294 --> 04:57.046
Your biogeneticist, to be specific.

04:57.130 --> 05:00.883
Dr. Leslie Hansen,
trauma surgeon par excellence.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.014
You're in a gen tech clinic.

05:06.597 --> 05:08.516
Genetic technology.

05:13.187 --> 05:14.856
Why am I here?

05:14.939 --> 05:16.482
We saved your life.

05:17.108 --> 05:18.943
Totally impossible anywhere else.

05:20.069 --> 05:23.948
You're lucky that Dr. Hansen found you
and transferred you here.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.372
What are you doing to me?

05:31.456 --> 05:34.876
That's just a precaution
until your condition stabilizes.

05:34.959 --> 05:37.128
They're not too tight, are they?

05:38.546 --> 05:40.506
You've had some muscle atrophy,

05:40.590 --> 05:42.842
but far less
than the average comatose patient.

05:43.426 --> 05:44.761
Amazing, really.

05:46.471 --> 05:47.847
How long have I been here?

05:48.473 --> 05:49.974
It's been a while.

05:50.058 --> 05:51.184
Five years.

05:51.267 --> 05:54.103
- But you keep getting stronger all...
- Five?

05:55.188 --> 05:56.189
What happened?

05:57.440 --> 05:58.441
Alisa...

06:00.777 --> 06:02.945
There was an accident.
You were badly hurt.

06:10.286 --> 06:12.914
Oh, my God. My kids.

06:12.997 --> 06:15.291
Where are my kids?
What happened to my kids?

06:15.374 --> 06:17.585
- It's okay.
- Where are my kids?

06:17.668 --> 06:18.920
Dr. Hansen, I got this.

06:19.003 --> 06:21.506
- Where're my kids? Where's Brian?
- I'll handle it.

06:21.589 --> 06:25.593
Dr. Hansen, give us a minute.
It's okay. I'll tell you everything.

06:25.676 --> 06:28.137
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

06:35.686 --> 06:36.813
Let's start with you.

06:41.484 --> 06:43.736
When we got you,
you were pretty much a goner.

06:44.403 --> 06:46.697
We had to induce a coma
after each treatment

06:46.781 --> 06:48.449
to manage the side effects.

06:49.534 --> 06:52.411
But the way you've come through it...

06:54.038 --> 06:55.373
it's mind-blowing.

06:56.624 --> 06:58.626
Come through what, exactly?

07:00.461 --> 07:02.630
Cutting-edge genetic editing.

07:03.464 --> 07:05.842
It stimulates healing
through cell regeneration.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.093
Genetic editing?

07:09.137 --> 07:11.889
- Rearranging DNA?
- Yeah. Right on.

07:12.557 --> 07:15.977
The cells develop
a healthy new biological structure.

07:16.060 --> 07:17.854
It's revolutionary,
and you're a part of it.

07:17.937 --> 07:18.980
But...

07:20.314 --> 07:22.650
if my cells were different, then...

07:24.610 --> 07:27.447
- I would be different.
- That's right.

07:31.576 --> 07:32.869
Where was I injured?

07:35.997 --> 07:39.459
You had significant bone and tissue damage
throughout your body.

07:41.127 --> 07:44.005
Including severe facial trauma.

07:46.757 --> 07:47.758
Show me.

08:13.951 --> 08:15.995
Do my kids still look the same?

08:21.667 --> 08:22.919
Where are my kids?

08:26.756 --> 08:28.007
I have some...

08:29.634 --> 08:31.761
- pretty hard news for you.
- No.

08:31.844 --> 08:33.596
- No!
- I'm sorry.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.932
- Brian and Phillip died in the accident.
- No. No!

08:36.015 --> 08:37.933
- No, no!
- Jessica survived.

08:38.017 --> 08:39.809
Jessica survived.

08:39.894 --> 08:41.729
Her injuries were less severe.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.858
She required far fewer interventions.
She made a full recovery.

08:45.942 --> 08:49.445
I want to see my daughter!
Where's my daughter?

08:49.529 --> 08:52.573
When you're better. When you're better.
When you're better.

08:52.657 --> 08:55.660
She's all right. She's safe.
But you're not.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.830
We're still treating complications
from your procedures.

09:01.457 --> 09:02.667
You don't know me...

09:03.834 --> 09:04.834
yet.

09:05.294 --> 09:07.129
But I am actually trustworthy.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.132
So, please, believe me...

09:11.384 --> 09:13.135
Jessica is just fine.

09:14.679 --> 09:15.888
She's just fine.

09:16.514 --> 09:19.684
Yo, yo!
I'm about to drop it like it's hot, y'all!

09:19.767 --> 09:22.019
With the music video world premiere,

09:22.103 --> 09:25.106
this is Trish

You guys are awesome!

10:56.489 --> 10:58.240
Tastes like platinum. Definitely platinum.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.533
Okay, who's drinking?

10:59.617 --> 11:01.994
- Yeah. Let's go.
- Me! Oh, my gosh!

11:06.666 --> 11:07.667
Okay.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.503
- I loved it!
- Thank you so much.

11:10.586 --> 11:12.046
Excuse me. Thank you.

11:15.007 --> 11:17.676
You know, you could pretend at least.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.470
To like the video?

11:20.888 --> 11:24.016
Hearing it at 200 decibels
doesn't improve the song.

11:24.892 --> 11:26.310
That's so mean.

11:27.895 --> 11:31.482
I just...
I've just heard it too many times.

11:31.565 --> 11:35.319
Well, if you don't have any nice words...

11:35.403 --> 11:37.822
I mean, anything nice to say, just...

11:38.531 --> 11:39.949
you know, lie.

11:41.617 --> 11:44.829
It got the It's Patsy theme song
out of my head, so there's that.

11:44.912 --> 11:50.042
Jess, this is important.
My label thinks I could win a VMA.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.839
And I'm sure that's great. Just...

11:55.881 --> 11:57.049
don't drink the Kool-Aid.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.927
Nope. I'm calling the shots. All of them.

12:00.010 --> 12:02.763
If that were true,
you would be in college with me right now.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.640
Was I supposed to turn down a record deal?

12:04.723 --> 12:06.392
You were supposed
to avoid this bullshit.

12:06.475 --> 12:09.270
Jess, a lot of people are working
because of me.

12:09.353 --> 12:13.774
And maybe hearing some silly pop song
will make somebody smile.

12:13.858 --> 12:16.402
I know. You're right.

12:17.445 --> 12:21.615
- And that's good. It really is.
- I know it is.

12:22.616 --> 12:23.659
It's really good.

12:23.742 --> 12:24.743
Hey, yay!

12:26.579 --> 12:28.497
That was so incredible.

12:28.581 --> 12:32.168
Best party ever! Right, Jess?
You having fun?

12:32.918 --> 12:34.253
I'm having bourbon.

12:35.337 --> 12:37.756
Ignore her. Let's go to the bathroom.

12:38.215 --> 12:42.052
Trish, come on.
You don't need any more of that shit.

12:42.136 --> 12:43.220
I'm fine.

12:46.932 --> 12:47.933
Champagne?

12:49.977 --> 12:51.520
I don't do bubbly.

12:52.980 --> 12:54.190
That chick's bitter.

12:55.149 --> 12:56.150
I'm into it.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.618
What the hell are you doing here?

13:06.494 --> 13:09.622
Waiting for a highball.
And hello to you, too.

13:09.705 --> 13:10.873
This is a private party.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.875
There is no way Trish put you
on the guest list.

13:12.958 --> 13:14.293
Oh, for Christ's sake.

13:14.376 --> 13:17.129
Haven't you done enough damage
to my family life?

13:17.213 --> 13:19.173
You damaged that all on your own.

13:19.799 --> 13:23.761
Yeah, well, if it wasn't for me,
Patsy wouldn't be where she is today.

13:23.844 --> 13:26.055
You mean in the bathroom, getting high?

13:28.349 --> 13:29.517
She's fine.

13:30.142 --> 13:34.313
I just saw her perform last week.
She looked wonderful.

13:37.191 --> 13:41.070
Look, there are a thousand bars
where you can get a highball.

13:42.196 --> 13:45.032
I am here to support my client.

13:45.115 --> 13:47.493
You haven't been Trish's agent in years.

13:47.576 --> 13:50.621
I'm talking about Kourtney,
her backup dancer.

13:50.704 --> 13:52.164
Voice like an angel.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.542
After auto-tuning, of course.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.210
She is very promising.

13:56.794 --> 14:00.172
She doesn't have
Patsy's natural star quality,

14:00.256 --> 14:01.924
but Patsy's special.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.301
Enjoy.

14:10.182 --> 14:12.351
This is a VIP bracelet I'm wearing, right?

14:12.434 --> 14:15.521
Yep. Matches your VIP eyes.

14:15.604 --> 14:18.774
I'm assuming you know how
to pour a drink for a VIP.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.526
I'm Trish's mother.

14:20.609 --> 14:23.779
Still dining out on that, huh?

14:25.072 --> 14:26.574
I thought you looked like her.

14:26.657 --> 14:29.326
Let me take care of that drink for you.

14:33.163 --> 14:35.875
Water of life. For the beautiful VIP.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.210
Much better.

14:41.338 --> 14:42.381
Thank you.

14:45.634 --> 14:49.054
Jesus. Is snake charmer on your resume?

14:49.680 --> 14:51.348
I can handle a little venom.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.894
You should see some of the assholes
who come in here.

14:54.977 --> 14:57.146
Fair warning, I'm one of those assholes.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.481
Or so I've been told.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.775
I doubt that somehow.

15:04.236 --> 15:05.237
Mr. Stirling.

15:07.364 --> 15:08.365
One second.

15:09.783 --> 15:11.869
What'd I tell you about over-pouring?

15:11.952 --> 15:14.413
Your breakage is higher
than any other bartender.

15:14.496 --> 15:16.165
I'm cultivating loyal customers.

15:16.248 --> 15:20.044
You're cultivating tips and ass.
Stick to the measurements.

15:22.546 --> 15:24.924
What? You got a problem with that?

15:25.007 --> 15:28.344
Just adding it to my list
of what not to do when I open my own club.

15:28.886 --> 15:30.930
You can't even manage
to show up here on time,

15:31.013 --> 15:32.556
let alone run a business.

15:32.640 --> 15:33.891
Stick to the measurements.

15:33.974 --> 15:34.975
Tell you what.

15:35.559 --> 15:38.395
Take one more dig at me,
see how long I stick around.

15:38.479 --> 15:41.690
- Is that a threat, asshole?
- Not anymore.

15:44.318 --> 15:45.694
Severance.

15:45.778 --> 15:46.779
Hey.

15:47.529 --> 15:49.156
You can't just leave.

15:52.117 --> 15:53.327
Well played.

15:53.994 --> 15:55.287
Party at my place!

15:57.081 --> 15:58.081
Shit.

16:05.464 --> 16:06.584
You were killin' it...

16:06.632 --> 16:08.592
I have class first thing
in the morning.

16:08.676 --> 16:11.011
Skip it.
You won't flunk out for missing one class.

16:11.095 --> 16:12.888
I will if we have house parties
every night.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.348
I'll get you a goddamn tutor.

16:14.431 --> 16:15.766
I need to study!

16:16.350 --> 16:17.351
You know what, Jess?

16:17.434 --> 16:20.020
I am proud of myself tonight,
even if you aren't.

16:21.188 --> 16:22.815
I want to be with my friends.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.317
You think they're your friends?

16:25.401 --> 16:29.071
They're just leeches, sucking your money,
your booze, your food...

16:29.154 --> 16:30.239
And you're not?

16:30.322 --> 16:32.408
Why don't you pay
your own goddamn tuition?

16:33.784 --> 16:35.160
Because you insisted.

16:35.244 --> 16:38.288
And your own goddamn rent,
instead of mooching off me.

16:40.582 --> 16:41.834
You think I need you?

16:43.168 --> 16:45.879
You think I can't get what I want,
when I want?

16:48.215 --> 16:49.591
I don't need anything from you.

16:58.934 --> 17:00.728
See? All set.

17:00.811 --> 17:03.188
That's great. That's just great.

17:03.272 --> 17:05.941
- Trish, forget her. Let's go.
- You know what?

17:06.025 --> 17:08.652
Don't call me when you're arrested
and you need bail.

17:08.736 --> 17:11.363
And don't call me when you OD
and need a hospital.

17:22.165 --> 17:23.250
God damn it.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.127
Damn it.

17:29.506 --> 17:30.507
Hey!

17:33.594 --> 17:34.803
Buy you a drink?

17:59.078 --> 18:01.080
Alisa?

18:03.207 --> 18:05.084
Dr. Malus is ready for ya.

18:10.547 --> 18:13.425
- I don't want any more tests.
- I get that. I do.

18:13.509 --> 18:17.346
Medical exam first thing in the morning,
not exactly the breakfast of champions.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.389
All right, I'll rephrase that. I'm done.

18:19.473 --> 18:21.225
- We still have work to do.
- No.

18:21.308 --> 18:25.395
This is about perfecting your technology.
It is not about healing me.

18:25.479 --> 18:26.772
Can't it be about both?

18:26.855 --> 18:29.399
You still have too many side effects
from the procedures...

18:29.483 --> 18:33.362
Experiments. Let's call a spade a spade.

18:33.445 --> 18:36.573
Sure. But sometimes experiments
have random outcomes

18:36.657 --> 18:38.534
that need to be remedied.

18:38.617 --> 18:39.701
Such as my temper.

18:39.785 --> 18:40.828
Such as your mood swings.

18:40.911 --> 18:42.788
- Which you caused.
- Maybe.

18:42.871 --> 18:44.832
Or maybe it was
the traumatic brain injury.

18:44.915 --> 18:46.416
Or some combination.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.752
But your strong emotions trigger a...

18:48.836 --> 18:51.797
Trigger a dissociative disorder,
which I can control.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.000
Which you will control
if I can get to the root of it.

18:54.049 --> 18:56.552
Karl! I am gonna have
a real strong emotion right now

18:56.635 --> 18:58.637
if you don't tell me where my daughter is.

19:02.724 --> 19:05.435
You're right. You're right, it's time.

19:07.229 --> 19:08.230
Take a seat.

19:10.357 --> 19:12.025
I don't need the chair.

19:12.109 --> 19:15.404
I do. For some readings.
Allow me to multitask.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.205
Here we go.

19:27.708 --> 19:28.750
Okay.

19:28.834 --> 19:31.253
Luanne, I've got that. Thank you.

19:37.926 --> 19:40.888
Okay, blue for your eyes.

19:44.266 --> 19:46.101
And the whites of your eyes.

19:56.403 --> 19:57.404
Comfortable?

19:58.405 --> 20:01.700
Yeah. Wish we had one of these
in the family den.

20:03.410 --> 20:05.537
Have I passed the small talk test?

20:05.621 --> 20:08.624
No test.
I just like shooting the shit with you.

20:09.541 --> 20:10.542
Jessica.

20:14.713 --> 20:15.714
Jessica.

20:19.009 --> 20:20.636
When we released her,

20:21.762 --> 20:24.264
we knew your recovery was a long way away.

20:25.015 --> 20:26.099
She needed a home.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.395
We arranged for another family
to adopt her.

20:33.482 --> 20:35.525
She has a new family?

20:36.610 --> 20:37.611
Yes.

20:43.033 --> 20:44.368
Good. No, that's good.

20:47.120 --> 20:50.457
And she's had a normal life, right?

20:51.375 --> 20:53.043
You said she's not like me.

20:53.126 --> 20:55.921
She didn't show any signs of it
when we discharged her.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.217
So what aren't you telling me?

21:03.011 --> 21:04.930
We didn't think you were gonna make it.

21:05.514 --> 21:07.933
The experiments we did were illegal.

21:09.017 --> 21:11.728
We had to declare your death
to save your life.

21:14.481 --> 21:19.236
Jessica believes her entire
biological family died in that accident.

21:21.446 --> 21:22.990
She thinks I'm dead?

21:23.073 --> 21:24.491
Breathe, Alisa.

21:24.574 --> 21:25.909
You lied to her?

21:25.993 --> 21:27.244
To keep her safe.

21:27.327 --> 21:30.998
- There's something dangerous inside you.
- No, I can control it!

21:31.081 --> 21:33.375
That first day that you woke up,
you attacked her.

21:33.458 --> 21:36.378
- No! No, I would never do that!
- Yes, yes, yes. You almost killed her.

21:36.461 --> 21:40.966
- No! I don't believe you!
- Stay with me. Stay with me.

21:41.049 --> 21:45.262
I want to see my daughter!
I want to see my daughter!

21:45.345 --> 21:46.430
Stay with me.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.313
No!

21:55.147 --> 21:56.148
No!

22:03.989 --> 22:06.742
I'm sorry. You can't see Jessica.

22:07.868 --> 22:09.077
Not the way you are.

22:26.136 --> 22:28.221
- Marie.
- No.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.433
- Elizabeth.
- Uh-uh.

22:35.771 --> 22:37.439
- Ginger.
- Seriously?

22:40.358 --> 22:43.236
- You do have a middle name, right?
- It's private.

22:44.029 --> 22:46.782
What happens if you were kidnapped?

22:46.865 --> 22:49.265
How would I alert the media
if I don't know your middle name?

22:49.326 --> 22:53.872
I will alert the media when I hang
the kidnappers by their nut sacks.

22:53.955 --> 22:55.082
Touché.

22:57.959 --> 23:01.838
But most boyfriends know their
girlfriend's full name by this point.

23:02.380 --> 23:03.673
Is that what we are now?

23:04.966 --> 23:07.094
What do you think we are? Roommates?

23:08.178 --> 23:10.472
With something on the side.

23:11.431 --> 23:14.142
Which doesn't include knowing
your middle name, apparently.

23:15.685 --> 23:18.355
Not knowing keeps
a healthy cushion of distance.

23:27.364 --> 23:30.325
"Jessica Campbell Jones."

23:33.829 --> 23:36.248
- Hmm.
- So much for my safety cushion.

23:36.331 --> 23:38.792
I like a name with a nice hard consonant.

23:42.796 --> 23:44.464
It was my mom's maiden name.

23:46.341 --> 23:47.341
Cool.

23:47.801 --> 23:50.137
She's, uh...
She's kind of always with you.

23:53.723 --> 23:57.644
Hey. I wanna get my roomie
something special.

24:44.691 --> 24:45.734
Hi. What's up?

24:48.153 --> 24:49.196
No.

24:51.156 --> 24:52.282
Why should I?

24:54.492 --> 24:57.954
I'm not gonna talk to that asshole.
He treats me like shit.

24:59.122 --> 25:02.417
He does, too.
Always looking down his nose at me.

25:02.500 --> 25:04.502
And you encourage the prick.

25:04.586 --> 25:07.047
Yes, you do. And I'm sick of it.

25:07.631 --> 25:10.508
You need to just stay
the hell out of this.

25:14.137 --> 25:16.181
That's... That's total bullshit.

25:16.264 --> 25:19.684
All you ever say
is what a goddamn loser I am.

25:21.645 --> 25:23.730
No. No. Don't have him call me.

25:25.440 --> 25:26.942
Leave me the hell alone.

25:30.904 --> 25:32.656
You need me to put the hurt on someone?

25:33.949 --> 25:35.825
My mom is pissing me off.

25:36.743 --> 25:37.911
That was your mom?

25:38.995 --> 25:41.206
Trying to force me
to be a goddamn plumber.

25:42.457 --> 25:43.458
That's random.

25:44.251 --> 25:46.294
It's my brother's business.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.797
Well, did you tell her about your club?

25:49.339 --> 25:51.508
She shit all over the idea.

25:52.717 --> 25:55.136
My parents paid
for my brother's plumbing license,

25:55.220 --> 25:57.013
but you think they'd invest in me?

25:58.306 --> 25:59.306
Hell no.

26:00.558 --> 26:04.562
You could always pretend
they died in a car accident.

26:04.646 --> 26:06.982
Damn. You're dark, babe.

26:07.565 --> 26:09.234
Better than feeling shit on.

26:10.193 --> 26:12.654
Do you pretend Trish died
in a car accident, too?

26:13.280 --> 26:15.699
Plane crash.
Only when I'm tempted to call her.

26:15.782 --> 26:16.782
Pass the cereal.

26:19.286 --> 26:20.620
Why not just call her?

26:22.789 --> 26:25.500
Better than pretending she's dead.
That's messed up.

26:26.084 --> 26:27.961
I'm messed up. I thought that was obvious.

26:29.129 --> 26:31.506
It's been a month
since you've seen Trish, right?

26:33.842 --> 26:35.385
She doesn't need me hanging around.

26:35.468 --> 26:37.095
What about what you need?

26:37.178 --> 26:40.682
- When did this become about me and Trish?
- I don't know. I mean...

26:40.765 --> 26:44.352
Your sister lives just across town,
and I've never even met her.

26:44.436 --> 26:47.772
Well, it's not like you invited me
home for Sunday dinner.

26:47.856 --> 26:49.941
Fine. We'll go meet my parents,

26:50.942 --> 26:55.780
you'll introduce me to Trish,
and we'll be one big, shitty family.

26:57.115 --> 26:58.533
Yeah?

26:59.951 --> 27:00.952
Yeah?

27:01.953 --> 27:02.954
Come on.

27:16.426 --> 27:19.596
I don't know. I didn't know what to do,
I just had to sit there.

27:21.139 --> 27:22.140
Give me a second.

27:22.807 --> 27:24.476
Yeah. I'll grab some drinks.

27:28.271 --> 27:29.391
Know what I mean?

27:29.439 --> 27:32.067
- You were perfect. You were great.
- It was justified.

27:32.150 --> 27:34.361
So, I walk in there,

27:34.444 --> 27:37.781
and there's just this crazy scene
going on.

27:38.573 --> 27:39.574
I mean, come on.

27:41.409 --> 27:42.911
Jess, what're you doing here?

27:44.079 --> 27:47.582
- Are you okay?
- I'm awesome. Rehearsing for my club tour.

27:47.665 --> 27:49.751
- We kick off in Miami.
- Detroit.

27:49.834 --> 27:50.668
Wherever.

27:50.752 --> 27:52.312
The "Cray Cray" tour. Gonna be bangin'.

27:56.174 --> 27:57.300
You look like shit.

27:57.384 --> 27:59.969
I'm just tired.
Rehearsals have been insane.

28:00.053 --> 28:02.347
I have seen you circle the drain
too many times

28:02.430 --> 28:05.642
- not to know what it looks like.
- I'm having fun. End of story.

28:06.768 --> 28:07.852
How's school?

28:09.646 --> 28:11.189
- I dropped out.
- What?

28:11.272 --> 28:14.401
Yeah. See how easy it is
to quit something you can't handle?

28:14.484 --> 28:20.031
I mean, I thought I was at least
going to college vicariously.

28:20.990 --> 28:25.245
- Wait. Are those boots McQueen?
- Are they?

28:25.328 --> 28:27.831
How many ATM's did you hit
on the way here?

28:27.914 --> 28:30.792
What do you care? I'm feeding myself.
I'm paying my own rent.

28:30.875 --> 28:33.211
I'm living with a guy
who doesn't think I'm a burden.

28:33.753 --> 28:34.921
You're living with someone?

28:36.464 --> 28:37.465
It's new.

28:38.633 --> 28:40.844
Jess, that's huge!

28:41.428 --> 28:44.347
I mean, does he, like, know about you?

28:44.431 --> 28:45.682
All of it, and...

28:47.267 --> 28:50.270
- he's still here.
- Wait. He's here, as in he's here-here?

28:51.104 --> 28:53.314
Oh, my God! Well, I want to meet him!

28:54.065 --> 28:55.066
Okay.

28:58.486 --> 28:59.654
- That guy?
- Yeah.

28:59.738 --> 29:02.031
- Oh, my God! That guy's cute!
- Yeah.

29:03.199 --> 29:05.535
Hi. Hi.

29:06.286 --> 29:07.286
Hi.

29:08.204 --> 29:09.831
- Cristal, right?
- Right.

29:10.457 --> 29:12.000
Trish, this is Stirling.

29:12.667 --> 29:14.961
It is so great to meet you!

29:15.044 --> 29:20.592
- What's up? I really dig your song.
- Thank you. Wait. I... I know you.

29:20.675 --> 29:25.972
Yeah. I used to bartend here.
The owner and I had creative differences.

29:26.055 --> 29:27.932
Meaning the owner is a dick.

29:28.016 --> 29:29.392
And a lousy manager.

29:30.226 --> 29:32.061
He seems to be doing all right.

29:32.145 --> 29:36.274
No, trust me. Running a club is an art.
He never got that.

29:36.357 --> 29:38.693
And I'm not just talking out of my ass.

29:41.362 --> 29:44.365
"Club Alias." Catchy.

29:44.449 --> 29:46.993
I'm opening up a spot in the East Village.

29:47.076 --> 29:51.039
Two bars, table service,
great music, like yours.

29:51.122 --> 29:54.125
In fact, I'm currently taking investors.

29:54.209 --> 29:56.544
If you ever wanna expand your brand,
give me a call.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.881
- I'll send you my business plan.
- For sure.

29:59.964 --> 30:02.300
- Maybe...
- We gotta go. Bye.

30:02.884 --> 30:05.303
- But you just got here.
- Nice to meet you.

30:09.891 --> 30:11.100
Okay, what?

30:11.184 --> 30:13.937
Is that why you wanted to meet her?
To get her money?

30:14.020 --> 30:16.439
Hold on. Hey, it's not like that.

30:16.523 --> 30:18.900
She already was calling me a freeloader.

30:18.983 --> 30:21.820
I wasn't asking for a handout.
It's a business opportunity.

30:21.903 --> 30:23.404
She's not gonna see it that way.

30:23.488 --> 30:25.532
She will when she's making money off
of it.

30:26.074 --> 30:28.326
Unless you think it's a bullshit idea.

30:28.993 --> 30:30.411
I know it isn't.

30:30.495 --> 30:33.122
Then you shouldn't be embarrassed
to offer it up to your family.

30:33.206 --> 30:34.415
We don't need her.

30:34.499 --> 30:37.460
We can get money whenever we want.
We can have anything.

30:37.544 --> 30:40.713
A club, a car, a pony.

30:41.381 --> 30:46.135
- You... You want to steal me a pony?
- Yeah, with an annoyingly cute name.

30:52.225 --> 30:54.227
Come on. Let's go find a pony.

30:55.728 --> 30:57.689
You ever seen a case like this before?

30:57.772 --> 30:59.357
Babette, my dog.

30:59.440 --> 31:01.818
She has a rage against bearded men.

31:01.901 --> 31:04.821
Don't ask why. She's a rescue.
Just came that way.

31:07.532 --> 31:10.451
All right.
I'm all set to change her. Keys?

31:10.535 --> 31:13.913
- When did you give her her sedatives?
- Half hour ago.

31:13.997 --> 31:16.916
- You see Dr. Malus' notes?
- 900 milligrams.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.335
I thought it was a mistake.

31:19.419 --> 31:21.796
That's a lot even for someone
three times her size.

31:21.880 --> 31:25.425
Shoot, if it was up to me,
I'd keep this barracuda knocked out 24/7.

31:27.677 --> 31:30.054
They said I'd get my own set of keys.

31:30.138 --> 31:33.308
- I'll talk to admin.
- IGH can get real thrifty on you.

31:35.393 --> 31:38.062
It's nice having just one patient
to worry about.

31:38.146 --> 31:41.232
- We were so slammed in nursing school.
- Inez, wait.

31:46.279 --> 31:50.992
- Where is she? Where's my little girl?
- Patsy Walker's family. They adopted her.

31:52.952 --> 31:54.245
No!

32:19.228 --> 32:22.231
How is two orders of orange chicken
a snack?

32:22.315 --> 32:25.526
Because anything after midnight
is considered a snack.

32:25.610 --> 32:28.279
What? You just made that up.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.239
Where you going with that food?

32:30.907 --> 32:32.575
Ah.

32:32.659 --> 32:33.701
Yes.

32:37.497 --> 32:38.498
Do you like it?

32:39.040 --> 32:42.085
It ain't no pony, but it'll do.

32:57.392 --> 32:59.394
Whoa. What's this about?

33:00.395 --> 33:02.915
It's the middle of the night, man.
This can't wait till morning?

33:02.981 --> 33:04.190
We were in the neighborhood.

33:05.191 --> 33:06.275
It's okay.

33:06.359 --> 33:08.319
I'm sorry.
Are we interrupting date night?

33:08.403 --> 33:09.403
What's going on?

33:10.113 --> 33:11.948
Jess, this is Wyatt.

33:13.074 --> 33:15.243
And Humpty and Dumpty?

33:16.786 --> 33:20.748
Yo, check out my man Stirling.
You're finally gettin' that nice trim.

33:22.291 --> 33:25.169
Not trim, and definitely not nice.

33:25.253 --> 33:27.005
I'll hit you up in the morning, man.

33:27.088 --> 33:30.717
Nah. Nah, man. It's been a year.
So, where the hell's my Club Alias at?

33:30.800 --> 33:33.052
Dude, chill.
This is not the time to talk...

33:33.136 --> 33:36.514
No. Where's my huge return on investment?
Where's my 50% of profits?

33:36.597 --> 33:38.766
I'm not building a goddamn lemonade stand.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.560
- This shit takes time.
- You had time.

33:40.643 --> 33:42.020
It'll be worth the wait.

33:42.103 --> 33:44.355
He already has a lead
on a spot on 9th and B.

33:44.439 --> 33:46.607
It's the perfect location.
It's gonna be dope.

33:46.691 --> 33:50.153
Yo, I hit a few snags, but, dude...

33:51.654 --> 33:54.073
this club's for real.

33:54.157 --> 33:55.867
I want my money. With interest.

33:55.950 --> 33:57.660
Hey, back off, Wyatt!

33:57.744 --> 34:00.663
Don't trip, man. I'm serious. We're close.

34:00.747 --> 34:02.665
Yeah, but you're not close enough,
asswipe.

34:02.749 --> 34:04.834
- Hey!
- Shut up, bitch.

34:19.348 --> 34:20.933
Oh, shit. She's...

34:21.559 --> 34:22.560
A bitch.

34:23.101 --> 34:25.396
Yeah. Go. Let's go. Go!

34:29.108 --> 34:31.485
Damn. That was...

34:32.277 --> 34:33.279
Thanks.

34:37.949 --> 34:39.619
You're my only family now.

34:40.995 --> 34:42.246
I gotta protect that.

34:53.841 --> 34:55.920
- Dry cleaning at 3:00.
- You got it.

34:58.930 --> 34:59.972
Dorothy Walker?

35:00.932 --> 35:04.102
- Who's asking?
- I'm Laura Patterson.

35:04.185 --> 35:08.564
I am... I was Jessica Jones'
high school math teacher.

35:08.648 --> 35:11.442
I was in the city.
I thought I'd try and reconnect with her.

35:11.526 --> 35:13.027
With Jessica?

35:13.111 --> 35:15.655
Connecting with people
is not her strong suit.

35:15.738 --> 35:19.075
Well, I never got the chance
to give her my condolences

35:19.158 --> 35:23.079
after what happened to her family,
so I just thought I'd check in.

35:23.162 --> 35:24.705
She doesn't live with me anymore.

35:24.789 --> 35:28.292
- Where is she now?
- I don't know specifically.

35:28.376 --> 35:30.211
You're not in contact with her?

35:30.294 --> 35:34.257
Contact would require communication skills
on her part.

35:35.424 --> 35:36.425
Um...

35:39.262 --> 35:41.305
Well, she always was a moody little shit.

35:43.307 --> 35:45.685
So you have no idea
where I could find her?

35:46.644 --> 35:51.399
Well, I hear she's shacking up
with some bartender,

35:51.482 --> 35:53.484
and apparently, he's bad news.

35:53.568 --> 35:56.362
Meaning what? Is he hurting her?

35:56.445 --> 35:58.322
Honey, I'd be more worried about him.

36:00.324 --> 36:03.744
- I'm glad she can take care of herself.
- That's putting it mildly.

36:03.828 --> 36:07.540
You know, I gave her
everything she could want,

36:07.623 --> 36:11.460
and she gave me nothing
but disrespect and ingratitude.

36:11.544 --> 36:14.630
You must've seen something in her,
to take her in as your own daughter.

36:14.714 --> 36:17.633
Well, my own daughter
isn't talking to me anymore.

36:17.717 --> 36:20.803
So, clearly, I thought
I was a better mom than I was.

36:20.887 --> 36:23.014
Maybe she's better off without me.

36:24.056 --> 36:28.895
Bullshit. A daughter needs her mother.
Always.

36:31.063 --> 36:32.523
Maybe I'll make a call.

36:33.441 --> 36:36.027
See if I can find out where Jessica is.

36:45.578 --> 36:46.579
Hey!

36:49.248 --> 36:52.251
- Turn on.
- Oh, there it goes!

36:52.335 --> 36:54.754
Aw, darn it! What the hell?

36:56.923 --> 36:58.674
- Come on.
- Hey, be careful.

36:58.758 --> 37:00.259
Turn it on a little bit more.

37:00.885 --> 37:01.928
Come on.

37:02.720 --> 37:06.057
- Oh. Sorry, lady.
- Heat's brutal, huh?

37:06.140 --> 37:08.935
- Yeah, we're dying.
- It's so hot.

37:15.942 --> 37:17.860
- Thanks!
- Thank you, lady!

37:52.520 --> 37:53.521
There you go.

38:21.674 --> 38:24.593
- What took you so long?
- I lost my stupid keys.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.388
- Hey.
- Hi.

38:28.931 --> 38:30.766
- What's up?
- Come on!

38:32.059 --> 38:34.228
- You get started already?
- Yeah.

38:34.312 --> 38:35.438
Yes, you did.

38:36.105 --> 38:38.107
- I've had five.
- Yeah, I'm over you already.

38:38.190 --> 38:41.902
- I'm not even drunk yet.
- That doesn't surprise me somehow.

38:41.986 --> 38:43.446
Just a water, please.

38:45.364 --> 38:47.033
I have to go to the ladies' room.

39:08.429 --> 39:10.014
Ah, shit.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.644
Everything all right?

39:16.896 --> 39:19.482
You don't happen
to have a tampon, do you?

39:20.524 --> 39:22.234
Uh, yeah. Just a sec.

39:26.906 --> 39:29.367
Sometimes carrying a purse
would come in handy.

39:31.243 --> 39:32.578
You don't have one?

39:33.120 --> 39:34.580
Not since I was eight.

39:34.663 --> 39:38.167
I almost strangled myself
when the strap got caught on a doorknob.

39:41.170 --> 39:42.170
Uh, here you go.

39:43.672 --> 39:46.133
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.426
I owe you a drink.

39:50.179 --> 39:52.473
I'd like that. I'll be at the bar.

40:01.357 --> 40:03.651
I wanna talk to you.
We could step outside...

40:03.734 --> 40:04.777
No, I'm not...

40:04.860 --> 40:07.738
- Dude, let go of my arm.
- I'm not gonna hit you.

40:08.531 --> 40:11.367
- All right. All right.
- That's what I thought.

40:18.666 --> 40:20.751
We got interrupted last time
we hung out.

40:20.835 --> 40:23.421
You want your money back?
I'll get it. Your loss.

40:23.504 --> 40:28.259
Yo. Chill the hell out. All right?
No one's here to mess with you, okay?

40:28.342 --> 40:30.052
I'm willing to forgive what you owe me.

40:31.262 --> 40:33.722
- In exchange for what?
- Your girl.

40:34.473 --> 40:38.436
I mean, she threw down with three dudes
packing heat. She's strong.

40:38.519 --> 40:41.689
What else can she do?
Is she fast? Can she fly?

40:41.772 --> 40:45.192
'Cause, I mean, these are talents
that I can use in my other business.

40:45.276 --> 40:48.654
Look, we...
we got a couple jobs coming up.

40:48.737 --> 40:50.990
They might get a little messy. So...

40:51.073 --> 40:52.616
You want Jessica to be your muscle.

40:53.325 --> 40:54.618
Yeah.

40:56.162 --> 40:57.538
What do you mean by messy?

41:12.428 --> 41:14.096
She can handle the dirty work.

41:14.180 --> 41:16.098
You think you can
persuade her, huh?

41:16.182 --> 41:18.851
She loves me, dude.
She'll do anything I ask her to.

41:18.934 --> 41:20.978
- That's my man!
- One condition.

41:22.271 --> 41:24.607
I get a quarter of whatever you collect.

41:27.234 --> 41:28.319
Yeah, all right.

41:32.907 --> 41:35.868
Hey, do you know where Stirling went?

41:35.951 --> 41:37.369
Mmm-mmm.

41:44.418 --> 41:46.045
- All right.
- Let's go.

41:53.677 --> 41:55.054
You lost, lady?

41:55.638 --> 41:56.472
What the hell?

41:56.555 --> 41:59.099
You don't get to screw her over
and then just walk away.

41:59.183 --> 42:02.019
- What are you talking...
- Jessica thinks you love her.

42:02.102 --> 42:05.231
- You were listening?
- She is not your whore to pimp out!

42:05.314 --> 42:07.024
You are way off-base.

42:07.107 --> 42:09.693
- I was getting them off my back.
- You liar!

42:09.777 --> 42:12.530
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm her mother!

42:22.373 --> 42:23.374
Stirling!

42:27.836 --> 42:28.837
Stirling!

42:31.966 --> 42:33.175
Oh, God!

42:33.259 --> 42:34.635
Stirling!

42:37.846 --> 42:38.847
Stirling!

42:38.931 --> 42:41.141
Somebody help us!

42:43.185 --> 42:45.771
Stirling. Stirling, don't...

42:45.854 --> 42:47.940
Somebody help!

42:48.691 --> 42:49.942
Someone!

42:52.111 --> 42:54.113
Somebody help!

43:37.156 --> 43:40.367
You back to rag on Trish again?
'Cause she's not in the mood.

43:41.660 --> 43:44.121
- Where is she?
- Can't you just send her a text?

43:45.414 --> 43:47.750
Hey. She'll be out in a minute.

43:48.459 --> 43:49.710
Get out of my way.

43:58.552 --> 43:59.553
Get out!

44:03.057 --> 44:06.101
It's not a big deal. This guy hooked us up
with some amazing shit.

44:11.899 --> 44:13.651
Don't look at me like that.

44:16.278 --> 44:17.780
Are you doing this for drugs?

44:17.863 --> 44:22.368
- No, he was just being nice, so...
- You deaf? Get the hell out.

44:22.451 --> 44:23.869
It was just a thank you.

44:27.289 --> 44:29.458
Hey. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.

44:29.541 --> 44:31.794
- Get your skeevy hands off her.
- You're interrupting.

44:31.877 --> 44:33.045
Gus, leave her alone.

44:33.128 --> 44:36.548
- You wanted to get on your knees.
- Just go away, all right? Go away!

44:37.841 --> 44:39.218
Bitch.

44:42.429 --> 44:45.516
Call me a bitch again.
Compare me to a dog.

44:46.141 --> 44:48.727
An animal that you can kick and collar.

44:49.603 --> 44:50.604
Say it.

44:52.022 --> 44:53.022
Bitch?

45:00.280 --> 45:02.324
Redefine the word, dickhead.

45:07.287 --> 45:08.455
Security!

45:24.930 --> 45:27.599
I wish I got a chance
to know Stirling better.

45:32.521 --> 45:33.522
Me, too.

45:36.775 --> 45:39.736
I just can't get that image of him
out of my brain.

45:44.283 --> 45:47.119
I mean, do they know who did it?

45:52.916 --> 45:55.586
The cops arrested those guys
that were harassing him.

45:58.464 --> 46:00.174
They saw them leave the bar with him.

46:01.341 --> 46:04.094
Would've felt better
to kick their asses yourself.

46:05.262 --> 46:06.805
I did kick their asses.

46:13.437 --> 46:15.522
Maybe that's why they did this to him.

46:17.274 --> 46:18.275
Jess...

46:19.693 --> 46:22.070
they did this because they're murderers.

46:26.158 --> 46:28.076
And everyone around me dies.

46:29.369 --> 46:30.370
Not me.

46:33.123 --> 46:34.541
I'm gonna live forever.

46:39.880 --> 46:41.798
You won't if you don't get help.

46:44.343 --> 46:45.344
I'm good.

46:46.762 --> 46:47.763
Yeah?

46:47.846 --> 46:51.308
I've been calling you for 24 hours.
Where were you?

46:52.559 --> 46:54.978
- I was rehearsing for my tour.
- You were high.

46:58.941 --> 47:00.984
They're not mutually exclusive.

47:07.032 --> 47:08.992
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you.

47:12.120 --> 47:13.372
Because I was high.

47:18.085 --> 47:20.254
Because I'm an addict.

47:24.132 --> 47:26.885
- Step one. Eleven more to go.
- After my tour.

47:26.969 --> 47:28.387
You won't survive the tour.

47:28.470 --> 47:31.348
- A lot of people are depending on me.
- You need help.

47:31.431 --> 47:33.350
Well, you're in no shape to give it.

47:36.687 --> 47:37.688
I know.

47:42.609 --> 47:44.111
But your mom is.

47:46.572 --> 47:47.739
Jess, no. I...

47:47.823 --> 47:50.325
You're better off with her
right now, okay?

47:50.409 --> 47:52.786
At least she'll take you back to rehab.

47:54.371 --> 47:56.248
I'm not leaving you alone.

47:57.874 --> 48:00.752
I'll be more alone if you die.

48:14.891 --> 48:17.227
Well, can we just...

48:19.855 --> 48:21.815
can we just sit here for a while?

49:25.754 --> 49:26.755
Oh, shit.

49:34.096 --> 49:35.889
Call security.

49:42.771 --> 49:44.690
Karl, stay back.

49:46.149 --> 49:47.818
She's okay. She's calm.

49:49.194 --> 49:51.405
- Then let's bring in Kozlov.
- No!

49:54.074 --> 49:55.617
I won't be a part of this.

49:59.913 --> 50:01.999
I've been worried out of my skull.

50:03.083 --> 50:04.084
I found Jessica.

50:07.337 --> 50:08.338
Is she okay?

50:11.508 --> 50:13.427
I have to stay away from her.

50:20.058 --> 50:23.061
- I can't live like this.
- Yes, you can.

50:24.813 --> 50:26.356
We'll find a solution.

50:28.734 --> 50:30.318
I killed people.

50:31.945 --> 50:33.321
Your nurses.

50:33.905 --> 50:35.407
It's not your fault.

50:36.450 --> 50:38.493
The way you are, I did that.

50:38.577 --> 50:40.078
I did this to you.

50:40.746 --> 50:42.247
This is all on me.

50:44.082 --> 50:48.503
But I promise. I... I promise you...

50:51.006 --> 50:53.550
I'll make you well enough
to see Jessica again.

51:05.479 --> 51:07.689
I was a botched experiment.

51:10.567 --> 51:13.737
But that didn't matter because
I stopped living in the real world.

51:17.574 --> 51:18.784
I didn't exist.

51:19.910 --> 51:20.911
Until now.

51:24.915 --> 51:26.333
I'm so sorry.

51:29.377 --> 51:31.546
Is there any way you could forgive me?

51:37.886 --> 51:38.886
No.

51:39.305 --> 51:45.651
