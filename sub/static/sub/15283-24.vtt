00:00.401 --> 00:01.567
Ooh, is mommy
gonna get Danny?

00:01.601 --> 00:02.834
Is mommy gonna get
Danny?

00:02.869 --> 00:04.551
Mommy's gonna get Danny!

00:04.586 --> 00:06.234
Oh, mommy's got Danny!

00:06.269 --> 00:08.399
Mommy got Danny!

00:08.434 --> 00:11.134
Mommy loves you. Ohh...

00:11.169 --> 00:13.401
That was fun.

00:18.800 --> 00:20.134
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:20.169 --> 00:21.132
He got it!

00:21.167 --> 00:22.368
Oh, man.
Ha ha ha!

00:22.403 --> 00:23.651
Fooled you.

00:23.686 --> 00:24.900
Fooled you!

00:26.517 --> 00:29.118
Hey, Abby, wait up.

00:33.417 --> 00:35.950
Hey, let's stop here.

00:35.985 --> 00:38.484
I like this view.

00:42.118 --> 00:44.351
Hey, watch it.

00:44.386 --> 00:46.584
Seriously?

00:48.000 --> 00:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:17.084 --> 01:19.383
Mommy got Danny!

01:21.617 --> 01:23.350
You ok, honey?

01:26.717 --> 01:30.317
I'm sorry, baby.
We must have caught something today.

01:30.352 --> 01:31.517
You're burning up.

02:13.517 --> 02:15.484
Help me!

02:15.960 --> 02:18.240
Case must be local.
JJ said not to bring a go bag.

02:20.090 --> 02:21.880
What's the army doing here?

02:21.915 --> 02:23.670
What the hell is going on?

02:37.500 --> 02:39.635
Guys, this is dr. Linda Kimura,

02:39.670 --> 02:41.690
Chief of special pathogens with the CDC.

02:41.725 --> 02:42.625
Hello.

02:42.660 --> 02:44.740
Hello. I'm sorry to meet
under these circumstances.

02:44.775 --> 02:46.920
We need to get started. What circumstances?

02:49.860 --> 02:52.780
Last night, 25 people checked
into emergency rooms

02:52.815 --> 02:54.275
In and around Annapolis.

02:54.310 --> 02:56.730
They were all at the same park
after 2 P.M. yesterday.

02:56.765 --> 02:58.495
Within 10 hours, the first victim died.

02:58.530 --> 03:02.100
It's now just past 7 A.M. the next day,
we have 12 dead.

03:02.720 --> 03:04.750
Lung failure and black lesions.

03:05.010 --> 03:05.765
Anthrax?

03:05.800 --> 03:07.210
Anthrax doesn't kill this fast.

03:07.245 --> 03:08.360
This strain does.

03:09.620 --> 03:11.540
What are we doing about potential
mass targets?

03:11.575 --> 03:13.182
Airports, malls, trains?

03:13.217 --> 03:14.790
There's a media blackout.

03:15.200 --> 03:16.400
We're not telling the public?

03:16.435 --> 03:17.705
We'd have a mass exodus.

03:17.740 --> 03:19.095
The psychology of group panic

03:19.130 --> 03:21.185
Would cause more deaths than
this last attack.

03:21.220 --> 03:22.540
Yeah, and if it does get out,
whoever did this

03:22.541 --> 03:24.641
might go underground and destroy
their samples.

03:24.642 --> 03:27.542
Or if they wanted attention and
didn't get it they might attack again.

03:27.543 --> 03:28.643
Doesn't the public have the right
to know that?

03:29.090 --> 03:30.205
If there is another attack,

03:30.240 --> 03:32.120
There's no way we'll be able
to keep it quiet.

03:32.155 --> 03:33.895
Our best chance of protecting the public

03:33.930 --> 03:35.970
Is by building a profile as
quickly as we can.

03:36.005 --> 03:37.205
What do we know about this strain?

03:37.240 --> 03:40.130
The spores are weaponized, reduced
to a respiral ideal

03:40.165 --> 03:41.830
That attacks deep in the lungs.

03:41.865 --> 03:43.685
Odorless and invisible.

03:43.720 --> 03:47.640
A sophisticated strain.
Only a scientist would know how to do that.

03:47.675 --> 03:50.140
These lesions are doubling in size in
a matter of hours.

03:50.175 --> 03:52.180
It's not the lesions Im worried about.

03:52.215 --> 03:53.430
It's the lungs.

03:54.010 --> 03:56.890
We don't know how to combat the toxins
once they're inside.

03:57.210 --> 03:59.645
And the reality is, we may lose them all.

03:59.680 --> 04:01.900
The remaing survivors have been moved
to a special wing

04:01.935 --> 04:03.270
At Walter Reed hospital.

04:03.690 --> 04:06.000
Our offices will become a small
command center.

04:06.300 --> 04:08.840
We'll be working with military scientists
from Fort Detrich.

04:08.875 --> 04:10.255
General Whitworth is coming here?

04:10.290 --> 04:13.305
He's in charge of site containment and
spore analysis.

04:13.340 --> 04:16.450
Determing what strain this is will help
inform who's responsible.

04:16.485 --> 04:18.402
My team is in charge of treating
all victims.

04:18.437 --> 04:20.285
Reid, go with dr. Kimura to the hospital.

04:20.320 --> 04:23.410
Interview the victims.
Morgan and Prentiss, there's a HAZMAT team

04:23.445 --> 04:25.190
that will accompany you to the crime scene.

04:25.630 --> 04:28.400
There's Cipro.
Everybody needs to take it before we go.

04:28.860 --> 04:30.710
We don't know if it'effective against
this strain,

04:30.745 --> 04:32.310
But it's something.

04:35.430 --> 04:36.900
This is really happening?

04:37.240 --> 04:38.370
We knew this could happen.

04:38.630 --> 04:39.505
We've done our homework.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.750
We've prepared for this. This is it.

04:42.260 --> 04:43.390
Jin dan.

04:43.820 --> 04:45.750
May you live 100 years.

05:03.080 --> 05:04.915
<i>"It will become fine dust</i>

05:04.950 --> 05:06.485
<i>Over all the land of Egypt,</i>

05:06.520 --> 05:08.470
<i>and will become boils breaking out</i>

05:08.505 --> 05:10.385
<i>With sores on man and beast</i>

05:10.420 --> 05:11.940
<i>Through all the land of Egypt"</i>

05:11.975 --> 05:13.610
<i>Exodus 9:9.</i>

05:14.420 --> 05:15.710
Do you have those files I've been
looking for?

05:15.745 --> 05:17.537
Did you see this memo from the director?

05:17.572 --> 05:19.295
Office-files and emails are being monitored.

05:19.330 --> 05:21.650
Yeah, they're trying to protect the
media blackout. Files?

05:22.130 --> 05:23.275
Uh, yeah, right here.

05:23.310 --> 05:25.245
Thanks. I want to see what kind
of medical treatment

05:25.280 --> 05:27.180
The victims received before I head
to the hospital.

05:27.215 --> 05:28.840
Why do you think the suspect in 2001

05:28.875 --> 05:30.085
stopped sending the letters?

05:30.120 --> 05:31.760
I have no idea, but if he hadn't,

05:31.795 --> 05:33.177
It would have been much worse.

05:33.212 --> 05:34.551
The worst part was not knowing

05:34.586 --> 05:35.890
when it was gonna be over.

05:36.220 --> 05:37.935
Feeling safe opening mail again.

05:37.970 --> 05:40.635
Five people died.
Many more exposed and sickened,

05:40.670 --> 05:43.300
Including a baby who was admitted
to the hospital

05:43.335 --> 05:45.700
after lesions appeared on his skin.

05:45.735 --> 05:46.885
How did he contract it?

05:46.920 --> 05:48.705
I have no idea.
Must have come into close contact

05:48.740 --> 05:51.330
with a tainted letter or crossed paths
with the unsub himself.

05:51.365 --> 05:52.290
How old was the baby?

05:52.325 --> 05:53.410
Seven months.

05:54.530 --> 05:55.595
Did he survive?

05:55.630 --> 05:57.100
I gotta run. Kimura's waiting.

05:57.135 --> 05:58.570
I'll call you from the hospital.

05:58.571 --> 05:59.571
Spence!

05:59.850 --> 06:01.355
Did the baby survive?

06:01.390 --> 06:03.230
Yeah, but, I mean,
that was a curable strain.

06:03.265 --> 06:04.950
This thing's entirely different.

06:12.350 --> 06:13.530
Agent Jareau.

06:14.830 --> 06:17.510
Uh, call me when he gets through security.
Thanks.

06:34.770 --> 06:35.925
The general's here.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.320
Is there bad blood with him?

06:37.700 --> 06:38.835
He was very critical of the way

06:38.870 --> 06:40.975
the '01 Amerithrax Investigation
was handled.

06:41.010 --> 06:43.080
Because of what happened with dr. Hatfill.

06:43.115 --> 06:44.065
Among other things.

06:44.100 --> 06:45.950
And this is the list of victims
you asked for.

06:46.560 --> 06:47.615
No high-profile jobs.

06:47.650 --> 06:50.100
No. Just ordinary people
frolicking in the park.

06:50.700 --> 06:52.185
Any word from the CIA?

06:52.220 --> 06:54.110
They said there are a few
overseas terrorist groups

06:54.145 --> 06:55.395
With funding and capability.

06:55.430 --> 06:57.450
They're working international.
We've got domestic.

06:57.485 --> 06:59.470
We need to look at anyone who
could profit from this.

06:59.505 --> 07:02.490
People who have patents on anthrax vaccines.

07:02.525 --> 07:03.667
Yes, sir. Garcia.

07:03.702 --> 07:04.775
And add to your list

07:04.810 --> 07:06.105
Anyone with access to weaponized spores.

07:06.140 --> 07:08.920
Universities, scholars working in
bioweapons research.

07:08.955 --> 07:11.610
Employees of labs who keep germ collections.

07:11.645 --> 07:12.580
Be back in a few.

07:13.640 --> 07:14.535
Right in here, sir.

07:14.570 --> 07:16.100
Thank you, agent Jareau.

07:16.760 --> 07:17.715
General.

07:17.750 --> 07:18.915
Agent Hotchner.

07:18.950 --> 07:20.650
This is ssa David Rossi.

07:21.380 --> 07:23.715
My scientists are decoding the strain.

07:23.750 --> 07:25.890
The additives used to strengthen
the bacterial capsules

07:25.925 --> 07:28.545
do not exist at our research labs.

07:28.580 --> 07:30.690
Are there any other labs using
these substances?

07:30.725 --> 07:31.405
No.

07:31.440 --> 07:32.740
I'd like a list of all the scientists

07:32.775 --> 07:34.185
In your anthrax program.

07:34.220 --> 07:36.665
I just said we don't use those additives.

07:36.700 --> 07:39.290
Sir, we can rule out your lab samples,
but not your people.

07:39.325 --> 07:41.220
We're looking at someone who has the ability

07:41.255 --> 07:43.660
to manipulate and weaponize anthrax.

07:43.695 --> 07:45.222
Your scientists make that cut.

07:45.257 --> 07:46.715
Now, we all know what happened

07:46.750 --> 07:48.860
the last time your team
looked into my people.

07:49.170 --> 07:52.300
Sir, our team officially ruled
out dr. Hatfill.

07:52.335 --> 07:53.960
I'm sorry if justice didn't listen to us,

07:53.995 --> 07:55.480
But the profile was accurate.

07:56.760 --> 07:58.220
Well, I'm outranked by someone

07:58.255 --> 07:59.645
who believes in your profiles.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.940
I'll get you your list. Lieutenant.

08:07.240 --> 08:08.250
Hi, Abby.

08:09.100 --> 08:10.700
You feeling any better?

08:11.780 --> 08:12.685
Ok.

08:12.720 --> 08:15.015
This is agent Reid from the FBI.

08:15.050 --> 08:17.310
If you can, will you talk with him?

08:18.650 --> 08:20.295
Abby, I'd like to try to do

08:20.330 --> 08:22.795
a memory recall exercise with you

08:22.830 --> 08:25.970
To take you back to the park, if that's ok.

08:31.560 --> 08:35.419
Yesterday afternoon, you rode
your bicycle to the park.

08:36.030 --> 08:38.360
How did the sun feel on your skin,

08:38.395 --> 08:40.440
the breeze through your hair?

08:41.250 --> 08:43.150
And the people that you saw?

08:43.184 --> 08:46.110
It was warm, windy.

08:50.570 --> 08:52.810
There were guys... football.

08:54.050 --> 08:55.300
Kids...

08:57.600 --> 08:59.370
I see free...

09:01.470 --> 09:03.430
Me seen fee me.

09:06.020 --> 09:08.175
Free knee.

09:08.210 --> 09:10.330
S... sin knee.

09:10.930 --> 09:12.335
All right, Abby.

09:12.370 --> 09:14.570
That's ok. You just rest now, ok?

09:14.880 --> 09:17.180
Me mock fee key me free.

09:18.130 --> 09:19.300
Shh, shh, shh. You just rest.

09:19.335 --> 09:20.910
Ok? Thank you.

09:30.950 --> 09:32.395
What's causing her aphasia?

09:32.430 --> 09:34.460
The poison is infecting the parietal lobe,

09:34.495 --> 09:35.710
impairing her speech.

09:36.140 --> 09:38.820
Some of the other patients displayed
the same symptoms

09:38.855 --> 09:40.235
Shortly before they died.

09:40.270 --> 09:41.965
None of the drug combinations are working?

09:42.000 --> 09:44.610
The only thing that's helping them
right now is the morphine.

09:54.340 --> 09:57.120
What are you telling people about
why the park is closed?

09:57.155 --> 09:58.890
Methane buildup in the sewage system.

09:59.210 --> 10:00.155
And they believe it?

10:00.190 --> 10:02.485
Oh, well, yeah, of course,
why wouldn't they?

10:02.520 --> 10:04.800
Hot zone and all surrounding areas
have been neutralized.

10:04.835 --> 10:05.730
You're safe here.

10:06.350 --> 10:07.410
Huh. Are you sure?

10:07.680 --> 10:08.750
Yes, ma'am.

10:09.600 --> 10:10.410
Thank you.

10:13.520 --> 10:14.560
Ok, check it out.

10:15.920 --> 10:17.880
High levels tested over there.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.425
That's probably where the unsub
released the attack.

10:20.460 --> 10:23.040
And there was a prevailing wind out
of the northeast yesterday.

10:23.075 --> 10:25.110
Airborne spores scattered that way,

10:25.145 --> 10:26.595
Hitting everyone below it.

10:26.630 --> 10:29.510
This park doesn't scream "target" to me.

10:29.570 --> 10:33.090
Terrorists usually target symbols...
White House, Pentagon, World Trade Center.

10:33.125 --> 10:34.780
I mean, it's a nice park,
but it's not a symbol.

10:34.815 --> 10:37.290
Ok, so, maybe it's symbolic for the unsub.

10:37.680 --> 10:40.150
Well, we know Kaczynski sent bombs
to Berkeley where he taught,

10:40.185 --> 10:42.585
Michigan where he went to school,
and Chicago where he lived.

10:42.620 --> 10:45.430
And the Amerithrax suspect sent letters
to two pro-choice senators

10:45.465 --> 10:47.065
whose politics he opposed.

10:48.100 --> 10:49.820
They can't help attaching a personal motive

10:49.855 --> 10:50.940
to the places they've targeted.

10:51.310 --> 10:55.180
Ok.
So, what does this place mean to our unsub?

11:08.450 --> 11:10.460
38-Year-Old high school history teacher.

11:10.930 --> 11:12.180
Leaves two kids behind.

11:12.215 --> 11:14.010
17 out of 25 dead.

11:14.460 --> 11:16.170
This strain is duplicating

11:16.205 --> 11:17.797
Every 30 to 45 minutes.

11:17.832 --> 11:19.355
It's poisoning the lungs..

11:19.390 --> 11:21.690
...causing massive hemorrhaging
and organ failure.

11:21.725 --> 11:24.195
Extreme bacterial amplification.

11:24.230 --> 11:26.250
Whoever created this had to at some point

11:26.285 --> 11:27.840
go to the trouble of testing it.

11:28.080 --> 11:28.905
What do you mean?

11:28.940 --> 11:31.440
Think about the way scientists work their
way up to human testing.

11:31.475 --> 11:34.025
They start with rodents, then advance
to larger mammals,

11:34.060 --> 11:36.750
And then at some point, they do a
very small trial run with people.

11:36.785 --> 11:39.167
There's no way this was his first
human test run.

11:39.202 --> 11:41.550
We would have heard about a
previous anthrax attack.

11:41.585 --> 11:44.040
Not if it presented itself as
something else.

11:46.900 --> 11:48.515
The general's briefing a
congressional committee,

11:48.550 --> 11:50.130
And the director's meeting
with the president

11:50.165 --> 11:51.640
In an hour and wants our input.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.710
I don't know how to do this.

11:57.640 --> 11:59.870
I can't stop thinking about Henry.

12:01.290 --> 12:04.310
He goes for a walk almost every single day

12:04.345 --> 12:05.345
At Potomac Park.

12:05.640 --> 12:08.050
What type of mother am I if I
don't at least call

12:08.085 --> 12:09.470
and tell him to stay at home?

12:10.510 --> 12:11.765
JJ, we can't.

12:11.800 --> 12:13.020
I know, but...

12:14.770 --> 12:16.585
How do I not?

12:16.620 --> 12:18.990
I understand that you want to
protect your son.

12:19.520 --> 12:21.905
But if we all called home and
used this information

12:21.940 --> 12:24.290
To give us an advantage that other
people don't have...

12:25.340 --> 12:27.190
Is that the right thing to do?

12:28.840 --> 12:30.155
We need to call Reid.

12:30.190 --> 12:32.600
He said this may not be the first attack.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.025
Hello?

12:35.060 --> 12:37.025
Uh, Reid, you have me, Rossi, and Hotch.

12:37.060 --> 12:38.955
Kimura made some calls. It turns out

12:38.990 --> 12:42.100
That two days ago, two people in
two separate baltimore ERs

12:42.135 --> 12:44.027
And one person in a Philadelphia ER

12:44.062 --> 12:45.885
slipped into comas and died suddenly.

12:45.920 --> 12:48.080
Now, the C.O.D. on all of
them was meningitis.

12:48.115 --> 12:49.715
Doctors didn't test for anthrax

12:49.750 --> 12:51.550
Because the illnesses presented
themselves as meningitis,

12:51.585 --> 12:53.295
but I think it can be caused by anthrax.

12:53.330 --> 12:56.575
Did they show symptoms that we're seeing now
The lesions?

12:56.610 --> 12:59.350
They wouldn't have if the bodily functions
expired as quickly as they did.

12:59.385 --> 13:00.045
How quickly?

13:00.080 --> 13:02.615
All dead within 3 hours of being admitted.

13:02.650 --> 13:04.775
But the first patient died yesterday
at 10 hours.

13:04.810 --> 13:07.110
Here's the thing - If they inhaled a
higher concentration of the strain,

13:07.145 --> 13:08.215
it would cause a quicker death.

13:08.250 --> 13:10.750
Organ failure without exterior
physical symptoms.

13:10.785 --> 13:11.820
What are their names?

13:12.710 --> 13:15.770
Gale Mercer, 31,
Martha Finestein, 48,

13:15.805 --> 13:17.910
Albert Franks, 52.

13:17.945 --> 13:18.545
What next?

13:18.580 --> 13:20.450
See if they visited the same
place on may 8th.

13:21.890 --> 13:23.575
Gale Mercer made a credit card purchase

13:23.610 --> 13:25.260
At the book front, owned by Albert Franks.

13:25.295 --> 13:26.747
We need to find general Whitworth.

13:26.782 --> 13:28.200
He needs to sent a team out there.

13:28.235 --> 13:28.935
Mm-Hmm.

13:45.840 --> 13:47.390
All right, JJ, I got it. Thanks.

13:47.860 --> 13:49.870
Look at all these people just
going about their lives.

13:50.290 --> 13:52.320
If they only knew what we were doing here.

13:52.355 --> 13:53.660
Better that they don't.

13:53.950 --> 13:56.085
JJ says the store's been closed
since the owner died.

13:56.120 --> 13:58.540
Gale Mercer's credit card purchase
happened right before closing.

13:58.575 --> 14:00.880
Well, that explains why only
three people were hit.

14:05.960 --> 14:07.155
We tested hot.

14:07.190 --> 14:08.420
I'll alert command.

14:09.260 --> 14:10.900
This was his test run.

14:11.790 --> 14:13.230
He's gotta have a history with the place.

14:13.950 --> 14:15.870
We need to get a list of current
and past employees,

14:15.905 --> 14:17.567
Customers with grievances against the owner,

14:17.602 --> 14:19.726
See if any one of them had
a science background.

14:19.761 --> 14:21.850
Can you believe there is
only a quarter-inch thick

14:21.885 --> 14:24.745
pane of glass between all of us and a WMD?

14:24.780 --> 14:27.490
Attack anthrax wasn't made to kill
three people inside a bookstore.

14:27.525 --> 14:29.220
It wants to be right out here in the open,

14:29.440 --> 14:30.990
where it can feed and multiply.

14:32.010 --> 14:35.010
Just a small amount could wipe
out everyone here.

14:35.770 --> 14:37.080
And they'd never see it coming.

14:41.050 --> 14:42.760
It feels like the plagues of Egypt.

14:42.795 --> 14:44.757
Ten scourges created by god.

14:44.792 --> 14:46.685
Plague six was unhealable boils

14:46.720 --> 14:49.670
believed by biblical scholars to be
caused by anthrax.

14:49.705 --> 14:51.150
Never missed sunday school, did you?

14:51.185 --> 14:52.360
Actually, never been before.

14:52.395 --> 14:53.567
How is she doing?

14:53.602 --> 14:54.705
She's a fighter.

14:54.740 --> 14:57.680
She's held on this long because
she's young and strong.

14:57.715 --> 14:59.980
But she's started to bleed into her lungs.

15:00.015 --> 15:01.595
One of four left.

15:01.630 --> 15:03.330
We're running into another problem.

15:03.365 --> 15:05.030
When the next of kin have questions,

15:05.750 --> 15:07.730
What do we tell them about cause of death?

15:10.240 --> 15:11.190
Yes, sir.

15:12.310 --> 15:14.270
We'll do what we can in the time we've got.

15:15.030 --> 15:15.930
Thank you.

15:17.300 --> 15:18.990
There are problems containing the story.

15:19.025 --> 15:19.685
What happened?

15:19.720 --> 15:22.250
I don't know, but the president may have
to make an announcement tonight.

15:22.285 --> 15:23.485
What did you hear from the bookstore?

15:23.520 --> 15:26.205
Ran names of former employees,
customers with grievances.

15:26.240 --> 15:28.890
No one with the science background we're
looking for.

15:28.925 --> 15:30.035
Garcia's still digging.

15:30.070 --> 15:32.695
Do we have everyone we need for the profile?

15:32.730 --> 15:35.470
Oh, yeah. Entire defense community is here.

15:35.505 --> 15:38.210
Never seen so many alpha males in one room.

15:38.800 --> 15:40.020
Let's get started.

15:41.570 --> 15:43.025
Because the locations hit

15:43.060 --> 15:44.545
are not symbolically significant,

15:44.580 --> 15:46.660
We believe that these attacks are personal.

15:46.695 --> 15:48.172
Understanding the significance

15:48.207 --> 15:49.650
of these locations will be the key

15:49.685 --> 15:50.905
to identifying him.

15:50.940 --> 15:53.670
This personal element strongly indicates

15:53.705 --> 15:55.515
A home-grown terrorist.

15:55.550 --> 15:57.115
Like the Amerithrax case, we believe

15:57.150 --> 15:59.550
this is someone from the science or
defense community.

15:59.585 --> 16:00.870
That's why you're here.

16:01.630 --> 16:02.750
We think you may know him.

16:02.785 --> 16:03.945
He may be one of us.

16:03.980 --> 16:07.100
These home-grown terrorists are
myopic zealots,

16:07.135 --> 16:09.380
Ideologues that believe that their work

16:09.415 --> 16:11.005
Is of the greatest importance.

16:11.040 --> 16:12.680
He may have preached about the threat

16:12.715 --> 16:14.360
of an attack on America.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.060
His coworkers would describe him

16:16.095 --> 16:17.262
as histrionic,

16:17.297 --> 16:18.348
paranoid,

16:18.383 --> 16:19.365
secretive.

16:19.400 --> 16:21.315
All due respect, that's a little vague.

16:21.350 --> 16:23.630
What are we supposed to do with
something that generic?

16:23.665 --> 16:24.935
Sir, we're not finished yet.

16:24.970 --> 16:27.225
He may have logged excess hours at work

16:27.260 --> 16:29.445
In the past weeks preparing for the attack.

16:29.480 --> 16:32.670
We believe he's taken the full dosage
of anthrax vaccines

16:32.705 --> 16:34.550
Over the recommended 18-month schedule

16:34.585 --> 16:36.155
And had yearly boosters.

16:36.190 --> 16:37.445
This guy has his on work space

16:37.480 --> 16:39.200
where he makes his product in privacy.

16:39.235 --> 16:41.087
He also has access to large, expensive,

16:41.122 --> 16:42.905
industrial-grade equipment at work.

16:42.940 --> 16:45.940
He's written about the threats of
anthrax attacks,

16:45.975 --> 16:47.405
published papers.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.410
Yet he feels no one is listening.

16:49.690 --> 16:50.825
And that angers him.

16:50.860 --> 16:52.715
Now, he may have recently experienced

16:52.750 --> 16:54.570
Some sort of professional humiliation,

16:54.605 --> 16:56.465
like be demoted or fired.

16:56.500 --> 16:58.050
Now, that would have been his trigger,

16:58.400 --> 17:00.115
the moment he decided to go rogue.

17:00.150 --> 17:02.240
And he may have betrayed his
loved ones to his cause.

17:02.275 --> 17:04.387
He may be recently separated or divorced.

17:04.422 --> 17:06.500
This is somebody who knows every detail

17:06.535 --> 17:08.694
of the 2001 anthrax attack

17:08.730 --> 17:10.720
And has talked about what that suspect did

17:10.755 --> 17:11.905
...right or wrong.

17:11.940 --> 17:13.819
He's watching the news very closely

17:14.069 --> 17:15.845
to see how the country reacts.

17:15.880 --> 17:18.180
Please share this with your departments.
Thank you.

17:25.270 --> 17:26.910
There's something I think you should see.

17:30.030 --> 17:32.740
January '02.
Classified hearing with the subcommittee

17:32.775 --> 17:34.175
on defense and homeland security.

17:34.210 --> 17:36.540
Dr. Lawrence Nichols.
He used to work at the institute.

17:36.575 --> 17:37.625
He left in '02.

17:37.660 --> 17:40.140
He didn't leave. He was forced out.

17:42.430 --> 17:43.985
Five people died.

17:44.020 --> 17:45.895
If you ask me, we're lucky it was just five.

17:45.930 --> 17:47.770
We're lucky that whoever sent these letters

17:47.805 --> 17:49.767
used cheap porous envelopes

17:49.802 --> 17:51.730
A not a... crop duster.

17:51.765 --> 17:53.145
America's enemies

17:53.180 --> 17:56.390
are capable of wiping out entire cities.

17:56.425 --> 17:58.147
And we are woefully unprepared.

17:58.182 --> 17:59.835
I'm looking at your proposal.

17:59.870 --> 18:02.745
Yes, sir. Every household needs gas masks

18:02.780 --> 18:05.480
and a two-month supply of Cipro
for each resident.

18:05.515 --> 18:07.225
Every major city needs hospitals

18:07.260 --> 18:10.315
with bio-safety decontamination
capabilities.

18:10.350 --> 18:13.355
Regarding the budget you propose
for this operation..

18:13.390 --> 18:16.655
Anything short of 50 billion would
be grossly negligent.

18:16.690 --> 18:19.920
Dr. Nichols, you've got to realize
how unrealistic that is.

18:19.955 --> 18:20.765
Unrealistic?

18:20.800 --> 18:22.620
We can't justify spending that kind of money

18:22.655 --> 18:24.100
on an attack that may not happen.

18:24.135 --> 18:25.657
You people are in denial!

18:25.692 --> 18:27.211
Doing this would incite fear

18:27.246 --> 18:28.695
and panic among the public.

18:28.730 --> 18:30.585
This country should be panicked!

18:30.620 --> 18:32.570
We should live in utter fear
of being attacked!

18:32.605 --> 18:33.990
Dr. Nichols, please sit down.

18:34.025 --> 18:35.822
I will not sit down.

18:35.857 --> 18:38.013
We live in a time of war

18:38.048 --> 18:40.170
and WMD proliferation.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.445
If you continue to be blind

18:42.480 --> 18:44.430
to our lack of preparedness,

18:44.465 --> 18:46.147
then americans will die.

18:46.182 --> 18:48.126
And I will have no problem

18:48.161 --> 18:50.070
in pointing the blame at you!

18:50.500 --> 18:53.130
Committee said he was becoming
unstable, fanatical.

18:53.165 --> 18:55.482
Which is why they removed him
from Fort Detrich.

18:55.517 --> 18:57.853
And railroaded from other
prominent positions.

18:57.888 --> 19:00.439
Dr. Nichols is well-respected
in our community.

19:00.474 --> 19:02.990
He believes in preparedness,
not proliferation.

19:03.025 --> 19:04.242
Well, he obviously felt like people

19:04.277 --> 19:05.460
Weren't listening. Maybe he was just

19:05.495 --> 19:06.370
trying to prove a point.

19:06.405 --> 19:07.285
He had access..

19:07.320 --> 19:09.340
.. lost a prominent job, got divorced.

19:09.375 --> 19:10.755
Fits your profile.

19:10.790 --> 19:12.010
We need to bring him in.

19:12.045 --> 19:13.195
He works for a company

19:13.230 --> 19:15.040
called Bio-Design Technology.

19:15.075 --> 19:16.395
We subcontract them.

19:16.430 --> 19:18.480
They don't work with anthrax.

19:18.515 --> 19:20.495
They deal primarily with the flu.

19:20.530 --> 19:22.145
Dave, you and Prentiss go to his office.

19:22.180 --> 19:24.570
Morgan, pull Reid from the hospital
and go to his home.

19:29.200 --> 19:31.990
We need to speak with
dr. Lawrence Nichols, urgently.

19:32.025 --> 19:33.407
Well, he's not in today.

19:33.442 --> 19:34.790
We need to see his lab.

19:36.110 --> 19:37.200
Follow me.

19:39.730 --> 19:40.685
Clear so far.

19:40.720 --> 19:41.970
All right, keep me posted.

19:42.650 --> 19:43.865
This guy just had people over

19:43.900 --> 19:45.080
for a charity event last month.

19:45.480 --> 19:47.580
We should probably take a
look around anyway.

19:47.615 --> 19:48.215
Ow.

19:52.950 --> 19:54.195
What's he doing in there?

19:54.230 --> 19:56.300
When was the last time you saw dr. Nichols?

19:56.335 --> 19:57.540
Three days ago.

19:57.870 --> 19:59.140
That's before the bookstore.

20:10.820 --> 20:12.090
Yeah, princess, what's up?

20:14.300 --> 20:15.230
Uh-Huh. Yeah, we're here now.

20:17.860 --> 20:18.800
Sorry. What?

20:20.100 --> 20:21.370
The lab is clean?

20:22.710 --> 20:23.690
You're sure?

20:25.280 --> 20:26.120
All right.

20:27.720 --> 20:28.810
They got nothin'-

20:29.680 --> 20:30.480
Reid.

20:31.460 --> 20:32.450
Reid!

20:33.480 --> 20:34.280
Reid?

20:35.940 --> 20:36.850
Reid?

20:37.540 --> 20:38.350
Reid!

20:38.400 --> 20:40.055
Morgan, get-get back! Get back!

20:40.090 --> 20:41.810
Get out of here! What are you doing?

20:41.845 --> 20:43.660
What's wrong? No, don't!

20:44.500 --> 20:45.790
What's wrong? Believe me, get back.

20:48.990 --> 20:50.300
Reid, open the door!

21:02.530 --> 21:03.365
Morgan, how's Reid?

21:03.400 --> 21:05.770
There's white powder in the room and
the air was blasting.

21:05.805 --> 21:07.815
Get a decon team suited up.

21:07.850 --> 21:10.025
Secure a gray zone outside that door.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.970
Clean him up and get him in the
ambulance fast.

21:12.005 --> 21:13.085
I should have been right there with him.

21:13.120 --> 21:15.310
Morgan, there's no time for second-guessing.
What do we know?

21:15.345 --> 21:17.760
Nichols is dead.
Blunt force trauma to his head.

21:17.795 --> 21:19.325
Reid thinks he's been dead 2 or 3 days.

21:19.360 --> 21:21.540
Well, then he couldn't have been
responsible for the attack.

21:21.575 --> 21:23.800
Reid took Cipro today,
so he's gotta be ok, right?

21:23.835 --> 21:25.185
I don't know. It was precautionary.

21:25.220 --> 21:26.755
It's not helping patients at the hospital.

21:26.790 --> 21:28.850
Yeah, but the didn't take it until
after they were exposed.

21:28.885 --> 21:29.645
Reid took it before.

21:29.680 --> 21:31.640
Yeah, but we've never tested this strain

21:31.675 --> 21:33.150
on a cipro-ready subject.

21:33.185 --> 21:34.050
We just don't know.

21:34.085 --> 21:34.850
Reid.

21:35.070 --> 21:36.765
Hotch, I really messed up this time.

21:36.800 --> 21:38.790
Reid, we need to get you out
and to the hospital.

21:38.825 --> 21:40.000
No. I'm staying right here.

21:40.035 --> 21:41.075
No, you're not, Reid.

21:41.110 --> 21:42.770
I'm already exposed.
It's not gonna do me any good

21:42.805 --> 21:44.077
to stop working the case.

21:44.112 --> 21:45.315
He's already infected.

21:45.350 --> 21:47.080
Now, if Nichols created the strain,

21:47.115 --> 21:48.775
he may have also created the cure.

21:48.810 --> 21:50.810
My best chance is to stay here,
see if there's a cure.

21:50.845 --> 21:52.407
Try to figure out who killed dr. Nichols.

21:52.442 --> 21:53.970
Come on, Hotch, say something to him.

21:56.360 --> 21:57.795
He's right. His best chance is inside.

21:57.830 --> 21:59.715
We're gonna get a suit and
mask to you right away.

21:59.750 --> 22:01.990
Don't bother. It's not gonna do me
any good. I'm already infected.

22:18.450 --> 22:20.790
This thing killed the first three
victims within hours, JJ.

22:20.825 --> 22:21.605
Garcia, stop.

22:21.640 --> 22:24.100
Please. I-I can't think about it that way.

22:24.135 --> 22:25.235
He took Cipro.

22:25.270 --> 22:27.520
He's got help. He's gonna be fine.

22:29.200 --> 22:30.560
I'm not good at this part.

22:31.040 --> 22:32.680
Every time you guys go away, I...

22:33.260 --> 22:35.125
I know you're in all kinds of
ginormous danger,

22:35.160 --> 22:36.990
and all I can do is sit here in my bubble,

22:37.025 --> 22:38.075
And I hope and I pray

22:38.110 --> 22:40.310
And I will my babies to come back to me...

22:42.930 --> 22:44.710
I try to stay positive, but...

22:45.760 --> 22:47.440
I don't know how to do this.

22:51.800 --> 22:56.130
If you could do anything to keep
your family safe,

22:56.540 --> 22:58.900
even if it meant breaking procedure,
would you?

23:00.220 --> 23:01.360
Yes.

23:01.710 --> 23:02.810
What procedure?

23:04.370 --> 23:05.630
Never mind.

23:08.150 --> 23:09.235
Reid, what do you see in there?

23:09.270 --> 23:11.270
I see cages filled with dead animals.

23:11.305 --> 23:12.495
I see signs of a struggle,

23:12.530 --> 23:14.230
probably before dr. Nichols was murdered.

23:14.570 --> 23:16.700
Equipment's missing. There's a large desk.

23:17.270 --> 23:18.400
Clutter all over the surface.

23:18.435 --> 23:19.655
But in the corner,

23:19.690 --> 23:21.430
There's a smaller desk.

23:21.670 --> 23:23.670
Two different work spaces?

23:25.950 --> 23:27.440
Two sets of handwriting.

23:27.750 --> 23:29.680
I'm looking at instructions on how
to boil lab-grade broth...

23:29.715 --> 23:31.910
...sterilize lab equipment,
and transfer spores.

23:31.945 --> 23:33.275
Nichols would know all that.

23:33.310 --> 23:35.015
He has a partner, maybe even a protege.

23:35.050 --> 23:37.230
Go back to the B.A.U., try to figure
out who this partner is.

23:37.265 --> 23:38.982
Hotch, why don't you go?
I'll stay with Reid.

23:39.017 --> 23:40.700
Funnel all the information you get to me.

23:46.120 --> 23:49.070
Hotch says Nichols may have had a
protege who turned on him.

23:49.900 --> 23:51.440
I think we should tell the supervisor

23:51.475 --> 23:52.812
that this is about anthrax.

23:52.847 --> 23:54.115
That's not our call to make.

23:54.150 --> 23:56.375
Screw protocol. Reid's in trouble.

23:56.410 --> 23:58.430
If we tell this guy the truth,
he might be able to help us.

23:58.465 --> 23:59.925
Look, I want to help Reid, too.

23:59.960 --> 24:03.060
But our job is to do the best we
can within our boundaries.

24:03.880 --> 24:05.780
Who's dr. Nichols close to here?

24:06.220 --> 24:07.615
Oh, no one, really.

24:07.650 --> 24:09.490
He worked on his projects alone.

24:09.730 --> 24:10.715
Is he ok?

24:10.750 --> 24:12.250
Does he mentor anyone?

24:12.860 --> 24:13.805
Not that I know of.

24:13.840 --> 24:16.580
Did he ever work on anything
other than the flu here?

24:16.615 --> 24:18.640
No. Why?

24:19.070 --> 24:21.730
Did he ever have samples of anything
he shouldn't have had?

24:21.765 --> 24:23.480
Look, I really need to know
what this is about

24:23.515 --> 24:25.620
before I answer any more questions.

24:25.655 --> 24:27.030
We'll get back to you.

24:40.230 --> 24:41.610
<i>Hi, we're not home right now.</i>

24:41.645 --> 24:42.990
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

24:44.900 --> 24:46.375
Uh, hey. It's-It's me.

24:46.410 --> 24:47.850
Just calling to...

24:48.220 --> 24:49.890
...see where you are.

24:50.530 --> 24:52.090
Um... give me a call. Ok?

24:53.130 --> 24:54.200
Love you.

25:03.170 --> 25:04.125
Hey, Reid.

25:04.160 --> 25:06.130
Gee, wow, no, uh...

25:06.620 --> 25:08.890
No witty Garcia greeting for me?

25:09.690 --> 25:10.925
I can't be my sparkly self

25:10.960 --> 25:12.160
when you are where you are.

25:13.130 --> 25:15.590
Garcia, do you think you can
do something for me?

25:15.625 --> 25:16.512
Anything.

25:16.547 --> 25:17.400
I, uh...

25:17.780 --> 25:20.460
I know I can't call my mom

25:20.495 --> 25:21.930
Without, uh-

25:23.120 --> 25:25.510
Without alerting everyone at her hospital.

25:26.830 --> 25:27.870
What do you need?

25:27.905 --> 25:28.735
I, uh...

25:28.770 --> 25:31.760
I need you to record a message for her.

25:31.795 --> 25:33.800
In case anything happens to me.

25:34.870 --> 25:36.275
Oh, nothing's going to happen to you.

25:36.310 --> 25:38.290
You're gonna... brilliantly
find out who did this

25:38.325 --> 25:39.900
and we're gonna treat this strain.

25:40.900 --> 25:41.735
I hope you're right,

25:41.770 --> 25:44.470
But if you're not, I just -
I really want to make sure

25:44.505 --> 25:46.430
That she hears my voice.

25:47.460 --> 25:49.740
Ok. Just, uh, give me a second.

25:52.880 --> 25:53.770
Are you ready?

25:54.280 --> 25:55.130
Ready.

25:56.770 --> 25:58.810
Hi, mom. This is spencer.

25:58.845 --> 26:00.000
I just, um...

26:01.340 --> 26:03.650
I just... really want you to know

26:03.685 --> 26:05.390
that I love you.

26:05.840 --> 26:07.160
And-

26:11.390 --> 26:15.030
I need you to know that I spend
every day of my life

26:15.065 --> 26:17.950
...proud to be your son.

26:22.640 --> 26:23.720
Reid?

26:24.280 --> 26:25.390
Prep the victim for transfer.

26:25.425 --> 26:26.350
I gotta go.

26:32.220 --> 26:33.140
Dr. Reid.

26:34.070 --> 26:35.100
You look nice.

26:35.880 --> 26:37.340
I haven't been in this outfit for a while.

26:37.650 --> 26:38.960
How are-How are the patients doing?

26:38.995 --> 26:40.352
Let's worry about you.

26:40.387 --> 26:41.675
I actually-I feel fine.

26:41.710 --> 26:43.690
Ok, if you feel any pain,
I could give you something.

26:43.725 --> 26:45.772
No, I-I'd rather not take any
pain medication.

26:45.807 --> 26:47.785
We can at least make you
feel more comfortable.

26:47.820 --> 26:50.000
I am comfortable and I don't want
to take any narcotics.

26:51.080 --> 26:52.160
Ok.

26:53.360 --> 26:54.645
Tell me how I can help.

26:54.680 --> 26:55.830
I think the cure for this strain

26:55.865 --> 26:57.060
is in here somewhere.

26:57.450 --> 26:58.425
Well, shall I start here?

26:58.460 --> 27:00.175
Dr. Nichols is a former military scientist,

27:00.210 --> 27:01.695
which means he's most likely secretive...

27:01.730 --> 27:03.180
...and most likely a little paranoid.

27:03.215 --> 27:04.905
He would have protected the cure

27:04.940 --> 27:07.130
and probably would have hidden
it from his partners.

27:07.189 --> 27:08.389
So look for something innocuous,

27:08.424 --> 27:09.889
something you would not suspect.

27:09.990 --> 27:10.940
All right.

27:11.820 --> 27:12.705
Hello.

27:12.740 --> 27:14.340
How's it going in there, kid?

27:14.375 --> 27:15.665
I've seen better days.

27:15.700 --> 27:17.200
Well, you got me and Garcia.

27:17.235 --> 27:18.360
Hey, Reid.

27:22.180 --> 27:23.360
Reid, stick with me.

27:23.870 --> 27:27.210
Listen, Prentiss and Rossi don't
think the partner was a coworker.

27:27.245 --> 27:29.137
Can you tell us anything else about him?

27:29.172 --> 27:30.995
I... I've already been through everything.

27:31.030 --> 27:32.600
Come on, now, kid,
I know you're not thinking straight,

27:32.635 --> 27:34.050
But the Reid I know wouldn't stop looking.

27:36.650 --> 27:37.920
All right, all right.

27:39.050 --> 27:41.390
I see a, uh, a framed photograph

27:41.425 --> 27:43.120
of dr. Nichols teaching.

27:43.155 --> 27:44.480
I see a...

27:45.400 --> 27:48.220
I see a binder with syllabi.

27:48.700 --> 27:49.960
Course assignments

27:50.390 --> 27:51.995
going all the way back to the 1970s.

27:52.030 --> 27:54.110
All right. So he kept a scrapbook
of himself as a professor.

27:54.145 --> 27:56.490
That tells us that he values
himself as an educator.

27:56.980 --> 27:58.190
A teacher.

28:00.190 --> 28:01.660
I saw something earlier. I didn't-

28:02.210 --> 28:04.500
I didn't make a connection
to it or to the partner,

28:04.535 --> 28:06.815
but he has a study on anthrax.

28:06.850 --> 28:09.920
He has an annotated bibliography,
table of contents.

28:09.955 --> 28:12.355
It's formatted like a thesis

28:12.390 --> 28:13.720
and has writing in the margins in red ink,

28:13.755 --> 28:15.015
like the way a teacher grades a paper.

28:15.050 --> 28:17.260
Now, Nichols wouldn't have let
just anyone in here,

28:17.295 --> 28:18.345
But he may have opened his lab

28:18.380 --> 28:20.905
for educational purposes, as a teacher.

28:20.940 --> 28:23.040
So the partner must have appealed
to him as a student.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.070
Nichols is helping him with his thesis.

28:26.105 --> 28:28.140
I- I can look up local Ph. D. students.

28:28.175 --> 28:29.877
Yeah, check the sciences.

28:29.912 --> 28:31.580
Biochemistry, microbiology.

28:31.615 --> 28:32.015
Uh...

28:32.880 --> 28:34.045
Cross-checking with names

28:34.080 --> 28:37.040
of former employees or
customers with grievances

28:37.075 --> 28:38.800
at the bookstore.

28:41.470 --> 28:42.830
Nothing, my doves.

28:43.470 --> 28:44.245
Listen to this.

28:44.280 --> 28:46.955
<i>"This country is woefully unprepared.</i>

28:46.990 --> 28:49.435
<i>Every household should have a
2- month supply of Cipro.</i>

28:49.470 --> 28:52.910
<i>Hospitals are in need of bio-safety
level 4 decon wings. "</i>

28:52.945 --> 28:55.210
That's verbatim to what we
heard from Nichols.

28:55.770 --> 28:57.790
The partner's adopted Nichols'
views as his own.

28:58.910 --> 29:01.700
The chapters are on setting up triage

29:01.735 --> 29:02.645
and mobile emergency rooms.

29:02.680 --> 29:04.820
I don't think this paper was written
by a science student.

29:04.855 --> 29:07.415
It's about city preparedness and response.

29:07.450 --> 29:09.800
So, Garcia, check with students
in the social studies-

29:09.835 --> 29:12.310
Public policy, urban planning.

29:13.990 --> 29:15.520
Hot to trot. There's a Chad Brown,

29:15.555 --> 29:17.015
School of public policy at U. Of M.

29:17.050 --> 29:19.850
Matches a Chad Brown, former
employee at the book front.

29:19.885 --> 29:20.905
That's gotta be him.

29:20.940 --> 29:23.860
Totally. He's been in the doctoral program
on and off for 5 years.

29:23.895 --> 29:25.365
Nix on a steady job.

29:25.400 --> 29:28.610
Was slapped with a restraining order
from his former girlfriend

29:28.645 --> 29:30.365
and has been arrested and released twice

29:30.400 --> 29:33.130
At protest rallies in D.C.
I'll tell Hotch.

29:33.165 --> 29:34.665
Kid, you did real good.

29:34.700 --> 29:36.000
Now get the hell out of there.

29:36.035 --> 29:36.925
Bye.

29:36.960 --> 29:37.980
Dr. Reid.

29:38.320 --> 29:39.810
You said the cure would be hidden somewhere

29:39.845 --> 29:40.425
we wouldn't suspect.

29:40.460 --> 29:41.970
What about Nichols' inhaler?

29:44.000 --> 29:45.590
Chad Brown applied for a civilian position

29:45.625 --> 29:47.370
at Fort Detrich 4 different times.

29:47.405 --> 29:48.850
His employment application.

29:49.100 --> 29:50.835
He never got past the psych evals.

29:50.870 --> 29:54.460
<i>"Is it appropriate to sacrifice the lives
of the few to save the many?"</i>

29:54.495 --> 29:55.775
He answered yes.

29:55.810 --> 29:57.785
Every time. Why he never got hired.

29:57.820 --> 29:59.575
Well, if he couldn't get into Fort Detrich,

29:59.610 --> 30:01.565
then being close to Nichols was
the next best thing.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.485
We talked to his thesis adviser.
In his proposal

30:03.520 --> 30:06.420
he was gonna write about the ease
of making homemade anthrax.

30:06.455 --> 30:08.970
And interviewed dr. Nichols just
to prove his point.

30:09.005 --> 30:10.530
Get the address to Prentiss and Rossi.

30:10.565 --> 30:11.310
Yes, sir.

30:13.880 --> 30:14.680
Ok.

30:15.500 --> 30:16.840
Yeah, they're hosing him down now.

30:17.270 --> 30:18.110
All right.

30:19.240 --> 30:20.600
They're checking out Brown's house.

30:20.635 --> 30:21.695
Go help Hotch.

30:21.730 --> 30:23.000
Hotch has plenty of people helping him.

30:23.035 --> 30:24.085
He needs you more than I do.

30:24.120 --> 30:25.835
Reid, I'm gonna see you off to the hospital.

30:25.870 --> 30:28.860
I'm about to get naked so they
can scrub me down.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.690
Is that something you really want to see?

30:32.070 --> 30:33.310
I'll check on you later.

30:33.930 --> 30:35.300
Take good care of him, please.

30:36.120 --> 30:37.280
Get this to the lab.

30:39.530 --> 30:40.890
I hope you're right about this.

30:40.925 --> 30:41.890
So do I.

30:43.130 --> 30:44.700
Dr. Reid, did you cut yourself?

30:55.880 --> 30:56.770
Let's go.

30:57.650 --> 30:58.620
Excuse me!

30:59.440 --> 31:00.650
What's going on?

31:01.120 --> 31:02.500
Why is he in that suit?

31:02.535 --> 31:03.880
Ma'am, please stay back.

31:04.110 --> 31:06.230
My kids are home.
Do I need to get them out of here?

31:09.340 --> 31:10.190
It's pretty bad.

31:10.225 --> 31:11.140
Emily.

31:12.110 --> 31:14.495
The house is infested with toxic mold.

31:14.530 --> 31:17.030
And they can't start taking down
the walls without protection.

31:17.065 --> 31:18.810
But there's no danger to you.

31:18.845 --> 31:19.990
Are you sure?

31:20.750 --> 31:22.240
Yes, ma'am, I'm sure.

31:23.480 --> 31:24.590
Ok.

31:27.460 --> 31:29.340
Don't Emily me.

31:33.690 --> 31:34.930
How are you feeling, dr. Reid?

31:36.620 --> 31:38.010
My throat's a little dry.

31:39.270 --> 31:40.580
But other than that, I feel...

31:40.950 --> 31:41.810
Flee...

31:42.610 --> 31:43.720
Feel fin.

31:45.370 --> 31:47.350
I feel-I fleel fin. I-

31:47.385 --> 31:48.650
Dr. Reid, ok.

31:49.080 --> 31:50.390
Driver, faster.

31:53.660 --> 31:54.630
I've got a home lab in a shed in the back.

31:54.665 --> 31:56.630
It's being secured as we speak.

31:56.750 --> 31:57.355
And in here?

31:57.390 --> 31:58.465
The house is totally clean,

31:58.500 --> 32:00.080
But there's something in here
you should see.

32:00.360 --> 32:02.980
I found a white powdery substance
here and here.

32:03.015 --> 32:04.720
I performed an instant field test.

32:04.755 --> 32:06.060
It's not anthrax.

32:07.170 --> 32:10.610
It looks like he might be testing
his dispersal device.

32:14.450 --> 32:15.570
Rossi.

32:17.260 --> 32:19.205
He's using light bulbs to carry spores.

32:19.240 --> 32:21.690
He throws them on the ground- Anthrax bombs.

32:22.690 --> 32:24.170
And I know where he's going with them.

32:55.140 --> 32:57.510
Derek. Dr. Kimura called.

32:57.545 --> 32:58.517
Reid's in trouble.

32:58.552 --> 32:59.455
What do you mean?

32:59.490 --> 33:01.050
He got way sicker on the way
to the hospital.

33:01.085 --> 33:02.325
He's in respiratory distress.

33:02.360 --> 33:04.160
Listen, he's with the people who
can help him the most.

33:04.195 --> 33:05.977
I need everybody's head here right now.

33:06.012 --> 33:07.760
Ok, so, uh, we spoke to brown's sister.

33:07.795 --> 33:09.175
They've been estranged for years.

33:09.210 --> 33:11.085
Did she say anything about the
park or the bookstore?

33:11.120 --> 33:13.935
Quiet hills park was where he
proposed to a girl. She said no.

33:13.970 --> 33:16.750
The bookstore's where he worked
to put himself through college.

33:16.785 --> 33:18.852
I guess he's bitter about
not being promoted.

33:18.887 --> 33:20.920
So both locations represent
rejection to him.

33:20.955 --> 33:21.915
So what's our next move?

33:21.950 --> 33:24.540
Prentiss and rossi found maps of
transit systems at his house.

33:24.575 --> 33:25.340
Here we go.

33:25.840 --> 33:27.605
Dr. Nichols wrote a classified study

33:27.640 --> 33:29.430
Commissioned by the u. S. Senate.

33:29.465 --> 33:31.220
It simulated a mock anthrax attack

33:31.255 --> 33:33.055
On the d. C. Train systems.

33:33.090 --> 33:35.350
Now, he emphasized the main line
- The red line-

33:35.385 --> 33:37.050
As most vulnerable to an attack.

33:37.085 --> 33:38.500
Forceful tunnel winds,

33:38.535 --> 33:39.860
Biggest crowds,

33:40.100 --> 33:41.295
Highest mortality risk.

33:41.330 --> 33:43.820
Now, I deployed teams to every
stop on the red line.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.467
I don't think he's targeting the red line.

33:45.502 --> 33:47.080
But you said he adopted
all of Nichols' ideas.

33:47.115 --> 33:48.475
Wouldn't he want to prove this theory?

33:48.510 --> 33:51.190
We also said that he chooses locations
that are personal to him,

33:51.225 --> 33:52.925
Ones that represent rejection.

33:52.960 --> 33:55.920
What is the one place that's rejected
him over and over again?

33:55.955 --> 33:56.885
Fort Detrich.

33:56.920 --> 33:58.400
It'd be impossible for him to get in.

33:58.435 --> 33:59.845
He wouldn't have to attack the fort.

33:59.880 --> 34:01.130
He could go after the people that work there

34:01.165 --> 34:02.342
Or on their commute.

34:02.377 --> 34:03.485
The closest station

34:03.520 --> 34:05.325
To the marc train is Frederick.

34:05.360 --> 34:06.980
Get on the line to Maryland Transit.

34:07.440 --> 34:09.135
But the study said the red line.

34:09.170 --> 34:10.945
The profile says he's going to Frederick.

34:10.980 --> 34:13.230
That's where I'm going,
and I could really use your help.

34:27.840 --> 34:30.145
No gas masks. Repeat, no gas masks.

34:30.179 --> 34:32.864
Rush hour crowd sees anyone in a mask,
there's gonna be a stampede.

34:32.900 --> 34:34.690
Morgan, I want you to stay aboveground
and help the crowds. 

34:34.690 --> 34:35.891
I'm gonna go down by myself.

34:36.125 --> 34:37.175
Not a chance, Hotch.

34:37.210 --> 34:39.690
Morgan, we're a man down.
If the area's infected,

34:39.725 --> 34:41.625
we can't risk losing both of us as well.

34:41.659 --> 34:44.870
We are a team.
We're gonna go down as a team.

34:53.060 --> 34:53.889
Hey, Lisa.

34:54.340 --> 34:56.210
Hey. I haven't seen you all day.

34:56.245 --> 34:57.530
Locked up in level 3.

34:57.565 --> 34:58.205
How did it go?

34:58.240 --> 34:59.810
It's pretty fascinating stuff.

35:07.090 --> 35:08.990
Seal the exits and clear the station.

35:29.960 --> 35:31.520
I've got it. Clear the train.

35:35.730 --> 35:37.570
Ok, i need everybody to listen up.

35:38.050 --> 35:40.660
I am FBI. I need you to exit the train now.

35:40.865 --> 35:41.565
My God.. what's happening?

35:41.600 --> 35:44.100
Please, everyone, through
this far door only.

35:45.520 --> 35:47.205
Chad Brown, don't move.

35:47.240 --> 35:49.190
Don't come any closer!

35:49.225 --> 35:51.140
Chad, put the bag down.

35:51.580 --> 35:52.940
Far door. Let's go.

35:54.570 --> 35:56.845
I can kill everybody here!

35:56.880 --> 35:59.080
And I will kill you before you do.

35:59.115 --> 36:01.155
No! No!

36:01.190 --> 36:02.415
Weapons down.

36:02.450 --> 36:03.650
General, what are you doing?

36:04.170 --> 36:06.325
Call your director.
Order from the president.

36:06.360 --> 36:08.480
The U.S. Army is taking this man
into custody.

36:08.515 --> 36:10.480
General, the army has no authority here.

36:10.515 --> 36:11.740
We do now.

36:12.190 --> 36:13.975
He helped create this strain.

36:14.010 --> 36:16.550
He's the only one who can show
us how it was made.

36:16.585 --> 36:18.817
Sir, he is a danger to the country.

36:18.852 --> 36:21.050
He is an asset to this country!

36:21.550 --> 36:22.800
And by presidential order,

36:22.835 --> 36:24.280
I'm taking him in.

36:24.720 --> 36:27.910
Sir, please come with me.

36:29.520 --> 36:30.510
Where?

36:30.700 --> 36:32.110
Fort Detrich, sir.

36:33.080 --> 36:34.870
You want me to go to Fort Detrich?

36:35.420 --> 36:37.470
We need you, sir, please.

36:40.050 --> 36:41.590
I helped create this.

36:42.510 --> 36:44.430
You have to name it after me!

36:44.690 --> 36:45.680
Of course.

36:46.350 --> 36:48.040
Standard practice.

36:49.320 --> 36:52.330
Now, hand me the bag so we
can go on our way.

36:58.100 --> 37:00.530
Are there any other samples present?

37:01.150 --> 37:02.110
No.

37:02.360 --> 37:02.895
Move in.

37:02.930 --> 37:04.800
You understand why I had to show everybody

37:04.835 --> 37:06.280
How vulnerable we are.

37:06.780 --> 37:07.770
What are you doing?!

37:08.380 --> 37:09.320
General!

37:09.710 --> 37:10.700
General!

37:11.240 --> 37:13.680
I can help recreate this for you!

37:14.490 --> 37:15.630
So how did I do?

37:16.520 --> 37:17.830
You were effective.

37:18.320 --> 37:19.605
I can't believe it worked.

37:19.640 --> 37:21.595
The profile said he needed validation,

37:21.630 --> 37:23.725
Especially by someone from Fort Detrich.

37:23.760 --> 37:25.820
Well, I'll give credit where it's due.

37:26.320 --> 37:27.880
I'm glad I listened to you.

37:40.410 --> 37:42.260
We, uh, got our bullpen back.

37:42.570 --> 37:43.290
Yeah.

37:45.310 --> 37:46.730
Look, I'm, uh...

37:47.570 --> 37:49.600
Sorry about "Emily-ing" you

37:49.635 --> 37:50.762
Back at that house.

37:50.797 --> 37:51.890
No, it's all right.

37:52.960 --> 37:53.810
Is it?

37:55.520 --> 37:57.490
Hey, I toed the company
line, didn't I?

37:59.500 --> 38:01.945
Do you think people would be better off

38:01.980 --> 38:05.000
Knowing everything we've
prevented since 911?

38:05.630 --> 38:09.510
Would it make them feel safer
or more vulnerable?

38:11.330 --> 38:12.980
You did the right thing.

38:13.640 --> 38:14.880
Yeah, I know that.

38:15.310 --> 38:17.215
I know it wouldn't have helped anything

38:17.250 --> 38:19.220
If that woman knew what was
happening across the street

38:19.255 --> 38:21.030
from her and her kids.

38:21.740 --> 38:24.050
I lied because it was my job,

38:24.320 --> 38:26.320
And I wanted to protect her.

38:26.355 --> 38:28.320
So what's eating at you, then?

38:35.875 --> 38:35.875
Uh...

38:35.910 --> 38:39.970
Am I naive to wish that lying is
never the right thing to do?

38:41.280 --> 38:42.610
With this job...

38:42.645 --> 38:43.530
Yeah.

38:43.880 --> 38:47.060
Sometimes, our job sucks.

38:47.750 --> 38:48.530
Yeah.

38:53.140 --> 38:56.410
And yet, next time I probably
won't hesitate to lie again.

38:58.080 --> 39:01.340
We got a lot of things to take
with us to the grave.

39:03.650 --> 39:05.420
Oh, so he ate the peas, too?

39:06.980 --> 39:08.350
Yeah, he is a good eater.

39:09.120 --> 39:12.800
You're gonna keep him up for me, right?

39:13.260 --> 39:14.140
Good.

39:14.690 --> 39:17.450
I just really need to spend
some time with him.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.590
I missed him today.

39:21.810 --> 39:23.080
Yeah.

39:27.190 --> 39:28.360
Hey, it's me.

39:28.980 --> 39:31.750
I know it's late, but, uh,
is Jack still awake?

39:33.580 --> 39:34.900
Do you mind if I speak to him?

39:36.420 --> 39:37.220
Thanks.

39:42.550 --> 39:43.510
Hey, buddy.

39:45.260 --> 39:47.200
What are you doing up so late?

39:50.210 --> 39:51.520
Oh, yeah?

39:53.210 --> 39:54.330
Right.

40:02.080 --> 40:03.610
You're eating jell-O?

40:05.835 --> 40:05.835
Hmm.

40:05.870 --> 40:06.920
Hey, kid.

40:08.010 --> 40:10.190
Hey, doc. Look who's back.

40:10.560 --> 40:11.990
Is there any more jell-O?

40:12.460 --> 40:13.500
Hey.

40:13.790 --> 40:14.930
Not so fast.

40:15.860 --> 40:16.815
What happened?

40:16.850 --> 40:18.340
You're gonna be all right, kid.

40:18.375 --> 40:19.740
And we got Brown.

40:20.140 --> 40:21.080
It's over.

40:21.790 --> 40:22.535
How's Abby?

40:22.570 --> 40:24.115
She's on the mend.

40:24.150 --> 40:25.625
So are the three others.

40:25.660 --> 40:28.010
You were right about where to
look for his cure.

40:30.200 --> 40:33.490
Why was dr. Nichols making
anthrax in the first place?

40:35.370 --> 40:38.270
He was a brain scientist downgraded
to working on the flu.

40:38.580 --> 40:40.905
Brown comes along asking for
help on his thesis...

40:40.940 --> 40:42.975
Would have been more than happy
to share his knowledge.

40:43.010 --> 40:45.840
There was no indication that Nichols had any
idea what Brown was planning.

40:45.875 --> 40:47.595
His strain and its cure

40:47.630 --> 40:50.990
are getting locked up in containment
at Fort Detrich,

40:51.025 --> 40:54.350
with all the other bio-Agents people
don't know about.

40:55.060 --> 40:55.890
Hmm. Really.

40:56.430 --> 40:58.390
What else do they have locked up in there?

41:03.170 --> 41:06.060
<i>"Security is mostly a superstition.</i>

41:06.095 --> 41:08.285
<i>It does not exist in nature,</i>

41:08.320 --> 41:12.240
<i>nor do the children of men as a
whole experience it. "</i>

41:12.275 --> 41:13.830
