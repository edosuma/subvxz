WEBVTT

00:03.370 --> 00:05.337
The White Ghost
has come back to haunt me.

00:05.339 --> 00:06.572
It's a witch hunt.

00:06.574 --> 00:09.174
Ms. Jones,
I need a flight to Washington.

00:09.176 --> 00:12.044
Michael Wilson. Guy's
served time and he's
a white supremacist.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.313
Card-carrying member
of the Herrenvolk Brotherhood.

00:14.315 --> 00:16.181
(explosion)

00:16.183 --> 00:18.117
KENSI: Is that Wilson?
SAM: Guy's in pretty bad shape.

00:18.119 --> 00:19.385
What's shaking, partner?

00:19.387 --> 00:21.186
Hi. All right. Hi.
Ooh.

00:21.188 --> 00:22.454
DEEKS:
DEA Agent Talia del Campo,

00:22.456 --> 00:24.590
this is Special Agent
Kensi Blye.

00:24.592 --> 00:26.625
What's your connection
to Michael Wilson?
The DEA has been

00:26.627 --> 00:28.193
following
the Harrenvolk Brotherhood.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.495
They move half the meth
on the West Coast.

00:29.497 --> 00:31.463
What about coke?
Not traditionally, but

00:31.465 --> 00:35.134
What kind of boat
did you build for him?
A submersible.

00:35.136 --> 00:39.438
<i>built capable of hauling</i>
<i>200 tons of cocaine.</i>

00:41.074 --> 00:42.374
Hey.

00:44.711 --> 00:47.179
SAM: Fertilizer?
CALLEN: Looks like the drugs
have been loaded out.

00:47.181 --> 00:48.614
This whole thing's
a giant torpedo.

00:48.616 --> 00:49.815
You cannot escape.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.750
Neither can you.

00:52.685 --> 00:54.153
(door slams, lock clicks)

00:59.759 --> 01:01.493
Callen, Sam, do you hear me?

01:01.495 --> 01:05.064
(distorted):
Ca... Sa... do you... ...me?

01:05.066 --> 01:06.732
Callen, Sam, do you hear me?

01:06.734 --> 01:08.434
(rustling)
Oh!

01:08.436 --> 01:09.701
What's happening?

01:09.703 --> 01:11.804
Sam and Callen
are on the sub.

01:11.806 --> 01:14.239
Where is it?
It launched.

01:15.175 --> 01:16.375
We are in the sub.

01:16.377 --> 01:18.277
I repeat-- we are in the sub.

01:18.279 --> 01:20.679
(distorted)
...drug... ...lizer.

01:20.681 --> 01:23.248
Say again, you're breaking up.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.584
Sa... ...breaking up.

01:25.586 --> 01:28.821
They replaced the drugs
with fertilizer.

01:28.823 --> 01:30.355
I need eyes
on that vessel, Beale.

01:30.357 --> 01:32.224
I know, I know.
I'm trying.

01:32.226 --> 01:33.725
I've got the Coast Guard Air
Station on the line.

01:33.727 --> 01:35.394
They're headed for the ocean.
Callen, Sam,

01:35.396 --> 01:37.096
do you still hear me?
Callen?

01:37.098 --> 01:39.665
Damn it.
Callen, Sam.

01:39.667 --> 01:40.799
Op... we...

01:40.801 --> 01:43.335
We are inside
the sub.

01:43.337 --> 01:45.404
Ca... ...me.

01:49.876 --> 01:51.310
I got nothing.

01:51.312 --> 01:54.179
We're on our own.

01:54.181 --> 01:55.314
(air whirrs)

01:55.316 --> 01:56.615
And we're diving.

02:30.683 --> 02:32.618
We cannot let that sub
get to the ocean.

02:32.620 --> 02:36.221
Lock up the harbor.
Even if we block
it with ships,

02:36.223 --> 02:38.891
it's not gonna matter. I mean,
they're underwater, in a sub.

02:38.893 --> 02:42.294
What are we gonna
use, a giant net?

02:47.400 --> 02:50.469
(grunts)

02:50.471 --> 02:52.171
G., give it up.

02:52.173 --> 02:54.173
There's no way to open
that hatch from this side

02:54.175 --> 02:57.943
short of C-4. This thing is
built like a damn battleship.

02:57.945 --> 03:00.546
The hell are you doing
there, MacGyver?

03:02.182 --> 03:04.483
It'll help us know
which way we're going.

03:04.485 --> 03:06.552
(air whirrs)

03:10.790 --> 03:13.225
We're turning
starboard.

03:13.227 --> 03:16.328
How deep Eric say
this thing can go?

03:16.330 --> 03:18.931
Deeper than I want it to.

03:18.933 --> 03:20.332
60 feet.

03:20.334 --> 03:22.968
Harbor's not even 50.
Deep enough

03:22.970 --> 03:24.903
to come and go
without being seen.

03:26.306 --> 03:28.307
Plus all the ship
traffic'll make it hard

03:28.309 --> 03:30.809
to pick up on sonar.

03:30.811 --> 03:34.346
We got to find a way to force
this thing to the surface.

03:37.517 --> 03:38.917
Yeah.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.355
What sort of music would
you like to listen to?

03:43.357 --> 03:46.258
Oh, I think I'd prefer
the silence.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.327
(phone chimes)

03:52.265 --> 03:53.732
The Coast Guard has a helicopter
over the harbor,

03:53.734 --> 03:54.800
but they haven't spotted

03:54.802 --> 03:56.335
anything yet.
They could sneak out

03:56.337 --> 03:58.604
underneath a tanker
and we'd never know it.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.806
HETTY: What's going on?

04:00.808 --> 04:02.274
What the hell was that?

04:02.276 --> 04:03.709
It's Hetty.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.544
Where is she?

04:08.815 --> 04:09.982
Everywhere.

04:09.984 --> 04:11.650
Turn her off.

04:11.652 --> 04:14.386
I asked you a question.

04:14.388 --> 04:16.355
We've got this,
just focus on your trip.

04:16.357 --> 04:18.457
Don't handle me, Owen.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.392
Beale.
I'm trying.

04:20.394 --> 04:22.628
Mr. Beale, if you turn me off,

04:22.630 --> 04:25.697
you'll regret it long after
your wounds have healed.

04:25.699 --> 04:28.834
Callen and Sam are trapped
on the narco sub.
What?

04:28.836 --> 04:31.670
How did they get on...

04:35.808 --> 04:37.909
Thank you.
You're welcome.

04:37.911 --> 04:41.313
Say something nice
at my funeral.

04:41.315 --> 04:43.548
We need to get back.
Immediately.

04:43.550 --> 04:46.551
You'll miss your flight.
To hell with my flight.

04:46.553 --> 04:48.387
Turn around.

04:48.389 --> 04:49.488
I have strict orders
to accompany you

04:49.490 --> 04:51.490
all the way to the gate,
Ms. Lange.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.325
And I have a lipstick gun
in my purse

04:53.327 --> 04:56.028
and I am not afraid to use it.

04:56.030 --> 04:58.397
Shoot me and the car
will crash.

04:58.399 --> 05:00.599
That's precisely why
I'm wearing my seat belt.

05:01.734 --> 05:03.802
We should go to the hospital
and question Michael Wilson.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.637
His gang is moving the
drugs; maybe he knows

05:05.639 --> 05:08.307
where the sub is going.
We're not even sure
if he can talk.

05:08.309 --> 05:10.375
Guys, what about the drugs?
We can't let several tons

05:10.377 --> 05:12.311
of coke hit the street. Come on.
All right, here's the deal:

05:12.313 --> 05:13.845
you go to the hospital,
see if you can interview Wilson.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.881
I'm gonna go back to his house,
see if I can find anything.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.649
Can I ride with you?
Yeah, sure. I'll call in

05:17.651 --> 05:18.984
the other agents
and brief 'em there.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.421
You know what,
on second thought, why don't

05:22.423 --> 05:25.324
you question Wilson.
I'll ride with Talia.
What?

05:25.326 --> 05:29.027
You're the one who wanted
to question him.
No, I said somebody should

05:29.029 --> 05:32.764
Do you want me
to question this guy?
No.
No.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.333
Okay.

05:34.335 --> 05:36.501
Fine.
(clears throat)

05:36.503 --> 05:37.769
Thank you.

05:37.771 --> 05:42.441
I will go to...
the hospital, then.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.776
We're federal agents.
The Coast Guard and Navy

05:44.778 --> 05:46.845
are already searching
for this vessel.

05:52.785 --> 05:55.454
You okay?
Considering I'm

05:55.456 --> 05:57.989
trapped in a tiny submarine
with tons of fertilizer,

05:57.991 --> 06:00.625
essentially turning it
into a giant underwater bomb...

06:00.627 --> 06:02.127
It's not that tiny.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.596
Speak for yourself.

06:04.598 --> 06:06.531
All right, look,
let's think, here.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.600
What can we do
to stop this thing?

06:12.939 --> 06:14.773
I don't know.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.375
We're in the bow.

06:16.377 --> 06:18.043
Most of the controls'll
be in the bridge

06:18.045 --> 06:21.146
back to the engine,
rudder and prop.

06:21.148 --> 06:23.148
What if we purge the ballast?
They used the cocaine

06:23.150 --> 06:26.051
as a ballast, now
it's the fertilizer.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.720
Any seawater ballast controls'll
be in the bridge as well.
You got any

06:28.722 --> 06:31.423
good news for me?
So far this thing isn't leaking.

06:31.425 --> 06:34.993
(deep, loud clang)

06:34.995 --> 06:36.428
What the hell was that?

06:36.430 --> 06:38.997
It must have hit the bottom.

06:38.999 --> 06:41.733
Or some old pilings.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.168
This thing was made
for open water,

06:43.170 --> 06:45.504
not navigating obstacles.

06:45.506 --> 06:48.573
Well, this just keeps getting
better and better, doesn't it?

07:00.553 --> 07:02.487
I've got a live
satellite feed of the harbor.

07:02.489 --> 07:04.723
Still no sign of the sub.

07:04.725 --> 07:06.892
I need you to plot
possible courses

07:06.894 --> 07:10.061
using everything we know
about this sub's capabilities.

07:10.063 --> 07:13.598
And I want you to find the
guy who designed and built

07:13.600 --> 07:15.667
this submarine and bring
him to the boatshed.

07:16.636 --> 07:18.537
I promise not to
work Beale to death

07:18.539 --> 07:20.038
until you get back.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.506
(short exhale)

07:21.508 --> 07:23.575
Let's move it, Jones.

07:25.778 --> 07:27.045
Have fun.

07:27.047 --> 07:29.181
Yeah.

07:35.154 --> 07:37.456
(mumbling):
Five degrees between...

07:37.458 --> 07:39.191
Hope that's not a farewell note.
Trying to get

07:39.193 --> 07:41.092
a rough idea of where
we are based on speed,

07:41.094 --> 07:42.527
running time, and the
course correction.

07:42.529 --> 07:45.197
I'm guessing we're
about three miles

07:45.199 --> 07:46.631
off the coast of Huntington.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.633
Well, that's good.
Means they're not planning

07:48.635 --> 07:50.902
on detonating this thing
under the Santa Monica Pier.

07:50.904 --> 07:54.506
Check it out.

07:54.508 --> 07:56.641
(grunts)

07:56.643 --> 07:58.176
Batteries.

07:58.178 --> 07:59.911
Makes sense to run 'em
along the keel

07:59.913 --> 08:02.981
because of weight.
Probably wired the
length of the sub.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.650
We disconnect these, we'll cut
their power by what-- 30%?

08:05.652 --> 08:07.652
Should at least slow 'em down
until they surface

08:07.654 --> 08:09.020
and switch to diesel.

08:10.256 --> 08:12.524
Let's do it.

08:17.864 --> 08:20.565
(electrical crackling)

08:20.567 --> 08:21.800
We're losing power.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.770
(beeping)
What is happening?

08:25.772 --> 08:27.272
They disconnected

08:27.274 --> 08:28.940
some of the batteries.
Can we fix it?

08:28.942 --> 08:31.676
Yes.
We just have to rewire them.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.745
We can't do that
with them in there.

08:36.582 --> 08:38.650
We can if they're dead.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.952
Turn off the air and power
to the forward hold.

08:52.932 --> 08:55.934
SAM:
20 bucks says
that was intentional.

09:03.309 --> 09:06.111
Yeah, we can use the batteries
to power these lights back up.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.313
Yeah.

09:08.315 --> 09:09.915
But they won't help
with the air.

09:12.652 --> 09:14.219
I'm really starting
to hate these guys.

09:14.221 --> 09:17.222
(knocking)

09:17.224 --> 09:20.992
MAN (muffled):
You think you're clever,
but you're not.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.561
Who am I speaking to?

09:22.563 --> 09:24.629
I am the captain.

09:24.631 --> 09:26.631
I am Jabril.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.233
And you are dead men.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.769
What's your game plan,
Jabril?

09:30.771 --> 09:32.304
JABRIL:
This is no game.

09:32.306 --> 09:34.773
This is jihad.

09:34.775 --> 09:37.776
We will eliminate<i> jahiliyyah.</i>

09:37.778 --> 09:39.778
We will restore sharia

09:39.780 --> 09:41.713
to the world.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.648
(whispers):
What the hell's<i> jahiliyyah?</i>

09:43.650 --> 09:46.818
The time of darkness before
we were given the Quran.

09:48.087 --> 09:50.221
Where we headed, Jabril?

09:50.223 --> 09:53.892
JABRIL:
We are going to paradise.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.994
You are going to hell.

09:55.996 --> 09:58.630
<i>Istishhadi.</i>

09:58.632 --> 10:00.165
These guys are martyrs.

10:00.167 --> 10:02.934
Which means...

10:02.936 --> 10:04.970
this is a suicide mission.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.640
Yeah.

10:08.642 --> 10:09.941
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Werner, extension 221.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.276
Mr. Wilson,

10:11.278 --> 10:14.679
I'm Marty Deeks. I'm
a detective with LAPD.

10:15.815 --> 10:18.116
I hate pigs.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.218
Huh. But apparently
love nostalgia.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.087
Seriously, who calls
cops pigs anymore?

10:22.089 --> 10:24.723
I got to ask you
some questions.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.725
I don't talk to pigs.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.827
All right, well, how do
you feel about the Navy?

10:28.829 --> 10:30.362
'Cause I'm currently
assigned to NCIS.

10:30.364 --> 10:32.664
Naval Criminal Investigative
Services-- you heard of us?

10:32.666 --> 10:34.366
No? No? Well,
we're pretty cool.

10:34.368 --> 10:36.368
Yeah, chicks dig us,
which is awesome.

10:36.370 --> 10:38.370
The point is
that two of their agents,

10:38.372 --> 10:41.106
who happen to be my friends,
are stuck on your submarine.

10:41.108 --> 10:46.344
I'll die
before I tell you anything.

10:49.181 --> 10:50.782
(moans)

10:50.784 --> 10:52.984
You will
if we don't speed this up.

10:52.986 --> 10:56.755
Go to hell!

10:57.690 --> 10:59.758
(indistinct chatter)

11:03.763 --> 11:05.764
None of my guys
or their informants

11:05.766 --> 11:07.766
have noticed anything
hitting the street.

11:07.768 --> 11:08.833
My guess is they're
still cutting the drugs,

11:08.835 --> 11:10.335
but the clock
is ticking.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.370
Yeah, I'm well aware
of that. Thank you.

11:12.372 --> 11:14.706
Okay, I wasn't implying
that you weren't.

11:14.708 --> 11:16.441
Good.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.777
All right, look,
I only have one agenda here:

11:18.779 --> 11:20.779
find the drugs,
arrest the people who got 'em.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.681
I'm not trying
to poach your boyfriend.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.816
Deeks is not my boyfriend.
He's my partner.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.051
My God,

11:26.053 --> 11:27.218
you guys are both in denial.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.687
No wonder you're wired so tight.

11:28.689 --> 11:30.155
You can shut up
any second now.

11:30.157 --> 11:32.857
You know, if I were you,
I would just go for it.

11:32.859 --> 11:35.794
Have a full-on
freak-fest weekend,
get it out of your system

11:35.796 --> 11:37.796
before you blow an O-ring
or something.

11:37.798 --> 11:38.797
No wonder
you like him.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.765
You both talk like idiots.

11:40.767 --> 11:43.101
Careful, honey.

11:43.103 --> 11:45.236
Don't let all
that pent-up sexual frustration

11:45.238 --> 11:48.039
force you to say something
you're gonna regret.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.108
You need to step off.
You need

11:50.110 --> 11:52.711
to let that boy under your hood
for a little oil change

11:52.713 --> 11:54.279
before somebody else does.

11:54.281 --> 11:56.715
Is that a threat?
No, that's a fact.

11:56.717 --> 11:57.849
Well, here's a threat.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.718
Stay away from my partner.

11:59.720 --> 12:03.988
Get out of my face before I
break that pretty nose of yours.

12:03.990 --> 12:05.757
That is a threat.

12:07.326 --> 12:08.727
(grunts)
MAN:
Whoa!

12:08.729 --> 12:11.362
(grunts)
Okay, okay, okay!
Break it up!

12:11.364 --> 12:13.231
Hey! What the hell's wrong
with you two?

12:14.333 --> 12:16.101
We're out of here!

12:18.871 --> 12:20.739
Hey. You all right?

12:20.741 --> 12:21.873
TALIA:
Yeah, I'm good.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.041
(sighs)

12:23.043 --> 12:26.311
Ow.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.379
(sighs)

12:39.225 --> 12:41.025
Wait!

12:41.027 --> 12:42.894
I don't want your apology.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.062
Good, 'cause you're not
getting one.

12:44.064 --> 12:46.798
Receipts for fertilizer.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.533
Ten bags at a time
from several different places.

12:48.535 --> 12:50.268
They're building a bomb?

12:52.104 --> 12:55.106
Or they've turned the sub
into one.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.496
I know you were
a math-a-magician

13:18.498 --> 13:22.433
but you really think this is the
best use of your time right now?

13:22.435 --> 13:24.235
I was a mathlete,

13:24.237 --> 13:26.371
and I'm trying to determine
how much air we have left.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.973
This thing is essentially
a cylinder,

13:28.975 --> 13:31.876
the volume of which
is pi times the radius squared,

13:31.878 --> 13:35.346
so about four-four feet
by ten.

13:35.348 --> 13:36.414
Not counting
what's in the nose,

13:36.416 --> 13:39.450
that gives us
roughly 500 cubic feet.

13:39.452 --> 13:42.053
Now, the two of us
will breathe about a cubic foot

13:42.055 --> 13:45.256
every two minutes,
which is...
250 minutes.
Four hours.

13:45.258 --> 13:46.925
We're laughing.

13:46.927 --> 13:49.427
(panting)
Yeah.

13:49.429 --> 13:52.497
If we didn't have to exhale.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.199
Every time
we breathe out,

13:54.201 --> 13:58.169
the carbon dioxide level
in here increases.

13:58.171 --> 14:01.239
Why do you always have to be
a sub's half-empty guy, huh?
Because when the CO2 level

14:01.241 --> 14:03.942
reaches three percent,
our breathing doubles.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.543
Then when it reaches
five percent,

14:05.545 --> 14:07.545
our breathing
quadruples.

14:07.547 --> 14:10.481
Beyond that, we'll start
showing signs of...

14:10.483 --> 14:14.586
disorientation, blurred vision

14:14.588 --> 14:18.256
and, uh, loss of consciousness
and eventual death.

14:18.258 --> 14:20.458
Bet you mathletes were
a lot of fun, huh?

14:20.460 --> 14:22.861
"Hey, guys, guess how many
pounds per square inch it takes

14:22.863 --> 14:24.596
to crush a kitten's skull?"

14:24.598 --> 14:27.966
We've been running straight
for a long time.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.434
That's good.

14:29.436 --> 14:31.436
Less chance of
hitting something.

14:31.438 --> 14:34.239
Okay.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.341
You want to strike out
at America,

14:36.343 --> 14:39.544
you basically have
an underwater bomb.

14:39.546 --> 14:42.881
Where do you use it
if it's not a crowded pier?

14:42.883 --> 14:45.884
I'd do a bridge
during rush hour.
Okay.

14:45.886 --> 14:48.419
Offshore oil rig. It's
an environmental disaster,

14:48.421 --> 14:51.489
loss of lives. Not to mention
the symbolism of oil.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.491
Cruise ship.

14:53.493 --> 14:56.027
Lots of innocent civilians.

14:56.029 --> 15:00.031
Icon of Western excess.

15:00.033 --> 15:01.599
A war ship.

15:03.068 --> 15:06.271
We're headed for San Diego.

15:06.273 --> 15:09.674
Where the USS<i> Van Buren</i>
is in port.

15:09.676 --> 15:13.011
You destroy
an American aircraft carrier,

15:13.013 --> 15:14.946
that's like Christmas
for insurgents.

15:14.948 --> 15:16.547
You want to talk
about symbolism...

15:16.549 --> 15:19.050
Not to mention
the environmental disaster.

15:19.052 --> 15:21.386
The USS<i> Van Buren</i>
is nuclear-powered.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.922
There are two reactors
on that thing.
The Navy

15:23.924 --> 15:25.590
will be actively searching
for us. Plus, they already have

15:25.592 --> 15:30.295
but... we can't run the risk
of this thing slipping through.

15:30.297 --> 15:32.964
If we can't force
them to the surface...

15:32.966 --> 15:34.599
We have to sink this thing.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.668
You know what that means?

15:38.003 --> 15:40.004
Yeah.

15:40.006 --> 15:42.674
Every receipt is for
ten 50-pound bags of fertilizer

15:42.676 --> 15:44.475
paid with cash.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.978
Now, I've checked garden centers
and home supply depots

15:46.980 --> 15:49.647
in a ten-mile radius, and so far

15:49.649 --> 15:51.649
I've got
three more identical purchases.

15:51.651 --> 15:54.118
If they're related,
that's two tons of explosives.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.553
None of which was found
in the house.
How many tons

15:55.555 --> 15:58.656
of coke on that sub?
I don't know. Nine. Maybe ten.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.658
If they replaced
with fertilizer...

16:00.660 --> 16:03.328
They have
a giant underwater bomb.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.263
(Hetty clears throat)

16:06.231 --> 16:07.532
Eric?

16:07.534 --> 16:10.535
(whispers):
She's back.

16:10.537 --> 16:12.103
Tell me

16:12.105 --> 16:16.040
what's going on.
And where the hell is Granger?

16:16.042 --> 16:17.241
You were paid to design
and build

16:17.243 --> 16:18.710
a sub for the
purpose of smuggling

16:18.712 --> 16:21.245
several tons of cocaine
into the country.

16:21.247 --> 16:23.281
No, I...
Shut the hell up.

16:23.283 --> 16:26.250
If you open your mouth
one more time,

16:26.252 --> 16:27.719
unless it's to answer
a question,

16:27.721 --> 16:29.721
I'm gonna wrap your
tongue around my fist

16:29.723 --> 16:31.255
and beat you
with it.

16:31.257 --> 16:33.992
They killed my wife.
That's on you.

16:35.427 --> 16:38.563
For all I know, having her
killed was part of your deal.
No,

16:38.565 --> 16:39.731
that's not true.
Why didn't
they scuttle

16:39.733 --> 16:41.632
the sub after the drug run?

16:41.634 --> 16:43.601
I don't know.
They wouldn't risk

16:43.603 --> 16:45.570
another run.

16:45.572 --> 16:48.573
So they must've had
another plan.

16:50.242 --> 16:52.777
DEEKS:
<i>If you don't cooperate,</i>

16:52.779 --> 16:54.545
you're gonna be
an accomplice

16:54.547 --> 16:57.215
to anything that happens
to those two federal agents.

16:57.217 --> 17:00.451
I hope they die. Painfully.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.754
Oh, you mean like you?

17:02.756 --> 17:04.489
I'm not dying.

17:04.491 --> 17:06.491
You're not?
(chuckles)

17:06.493 --> 17:10.061
All right, let me let you in on
something pretty special here.

17:10.796 --> 17:12.196
Smile.

17:14.266 --> 17:16.601
That's you, Wilson.

17:16.603 --> 17:19.804
You got burns over 70%
of your body.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.806
I refuse to die.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.608
I refused
to grow up.

17:23.610 --> 17:25.777
Actually, that's working out
pretty well for me.

17:25.779 --> 17:29.380
But you, you, on the other hand,
well, let's see, shall we?

17:29.382 --> 17:32.083
"Surviving burns."

17:32.085 --> 17:34.318
It is the rule
of the nines.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.320
So, you get nine percent
for each arm,

17:36.322 --> 17:38.556
18% for each leg,

17:38.558 --> 17:40.558
nine for the front torso,
nine for the back torso,

17:40.560 --> 17:42.693
another nine
for the head.

17:42.695 --> 17:43.828
Yours is probably a six
for burns,

17:43.830 --> 17:45.363
another two for ugliness--

17:45.365 --> 17:46.631
and that's being generous
on both accounts.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.699
You take that number,
add it to your age

17:48.701 --> 17:53.204
then it says you're not
gonna survive. You're 32,

17:53.206 --> 17:56.541
and that's... 48, 52, 61, 70.

17:56.543 --> 17:58.810
70 plus 32

17:58.812 --> 18:01.145
is a hundred and...

18:01.147 --> 18:04.115
102.

18:04.117 --> 18:06.818
You're dying, Wilson.

18:06.820 --> 18:08.820
You're dying.

18:08.822 --> 18:10.788
(shuddering breath)

18:10.790 --> 18:12.657
No, no.
See, don't...

18:12.659 --> 18:14.325
You don't want to...
you don't want to do that

18:14.327 --> 18:16.394
because the, uh,
salt from your tears,

18:16.396 --> 18:17.662
you're gonna sting your burns.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.764
Screw you, bitch!

18:19.766 --> 18:23.367
Bitch? I'm not the one crying.

18:24.303 --> 18:27.438
Wow, this is...
this is getting awkward.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.640
Do you want some water
or something?

18:29.642 --> 18:30.775
No.
No water?

18:30.777 --> 18:32.810
What about, uh...
what about whiskey?

18:32.812 --> 18:34.779
Look at those eyes

18:34.781 --> 18:36.781
light up.
(chuckles)

18:36.783 --> 18:38.716
It's funny 'cause I always carry
around these little rascals

18:38.718 --> 18:41.319
just in case I get shot
on the job by some loser

18:41.321 --> 18:44.555
like yourself. I figure
if I'm gonna die,

18:44.557 --> 18:47.358
I might as well have a drink
before I go.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.860
There you go, brother.

18:48.862 --> 18:51.195
Oh, uh, one thing.

18:51.197 --> 18:52.797
Where is your sub going?

18:52.799 --> 18:54.866
Oh, you son of a bitch.

18:56.735 --> 18:58.803
All right, suit yourself.

18:58.805 --> 19:01.139
(slurping)
Oh, God, that's smooth.

19:01.141 --> 19:03.374
You know, I saw a guy
with a drill bit in his head.

19:03.376 --> 19:05.877
He could probably use a drink.

19:05.879 --> 19:09.147
(panting)
It's not my sub!

19:09.848 --> 19:11.849
How the hell do we sink it?

19:11.851 --> 19:14.519
We need a big-ass drill

19:14.521 --> 19:16.687
or a cutting torch
to breach the hull.

19:16.689 --> 19:19.323
Could a thermite reaction
burn through?

19:19.325 --> 19:20.791
Maybe.

19:20.793 --> 19:23.661
But we'd need magnesium
to ignite some iron oxide.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.931
We got plenty of rust here from
all the salt water corrosion.

19:26.933 --> 19:30.268
We need to collect
as much as we can.

19:30.270 --> 19:31.602
We add some aluminum
to get the temperature up,

19:31.604 --> 19:33.437
we may be able
to burn through a weld

19:33.439 --> 19:35.439
or soften it enough
to compromise its integrity.

19:35.441 --> 19:37.575
But we don't have
any magnesium.

19:37.577 --> 19:38.776
We have lithium.
From the batteries.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.378
Lithium.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.714
It's an alkali metal.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.816
It's highly reactive
and flammable.

19:45.818 --> 19:48.920
Hell, it's a fusion fuel
in staged thermonuclear weapons.

19:48.922 --> 19:52.290
We short-circuit the batteries,
we can induce thermal runaway.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.559
I don't think
I've ever seen you this excited

19:54.561 --> 19:55.960
about a suicide plan.

19:57.729 --> 19:59.931
The sub belongs to the hadjis.

19:59.933 --> 20:01.732
Who?
Some camel cowboys

20:01.734 --> 20:05.436
had it built
to bring in the drugs.

20:05.438 --> 20:06.904
You got names for me?

20:06.906 --> 20:09.640
Guy named Jabril.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.375
We called him
Jar Jar Binks.

20:11.377 --> 20:14.212
I'm sure he appreciated that.
You got last names?

20:14.214 --> 20:15.746
No.

20:15.748 --> 20:17.348
Where's he from?

20:17.350 --> 20:19.584
Syria, Iraq.
I don't know.

20:19.586 --> 20:21.586
Some Middle East crap hole.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.321
And where
are the drugs now?

20:23.323 --> 20:25.423
Oh, I ain't telling you that.

20:29.628 --> 20:32.997
(slurping)

20:35.434 --> 20:38.502
Oh, God, that's good.

20:38.504 --> 20:40.805
You know, I feel like, uh,

20:40.807 --> 20:42.940
we should probably just...

20:42.942 --> 20:45.943
be honest with each other,
you know?

20:45.945 --> 20:47.945
'Cause here's the deal:

20:47.947 --> 20:49.814
no one's gonna know.

20:49.816 --> 20:51.882
I mean, think about it.
Your brothers are gonna think

20:51.884 --> 20:53.684
you died defending the cause.

20:53.686 --> 20:56.687
You're gonna take several tons
of cocaine off the street,

20:56.689 --> 20:58.756
which is a bargaining chip
in the afterlife,

20:58.758 --> 21:00.625
and, uh, let's just face it,

21:00.627 --> 21:02.693
you're probably gonna need that.

21:04.663 --> 21:06.731
Mike?

21:07.666 --> 21:09.667
(sighs)

21:09.669 --> 21:11.669
God have mercy
on your soul.

21:11.671 --> 21:14.038
All right, all right.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.674
All right.
A guy named

21:16.676 --> 21:18.676
Worm is cutting it at his place.

21:18.678 --> 21:21.045
I don't know his real name,
I swear.

21:21.047 --> 21:25.049
Works out of a Chinese
restaurant in Reseda.

21:25.051 --> 21:28.719
So, you got a white supremacist
working at a Chinese restaurant?

21:28.721 --> 21:33.424
Guess you can never
judge a... book by its cover.

21:33.426 --> 21:35.426
Hey, hey, hey.

21:35.428 --> 21:37.395
What about my drink?
This?

21:37.397 --> 21:39.730
No, you can't... you can't drink
in your condition.

21:40.999 --> 21:43.501
I'm just kidding.

21:46.938 --> 21:48.939
That's freaking apple juice!

21:48.941 --> 21:51.609
You're a lying bastard!
I know,

21:51.611 --> 21:53.911
but the good news is,
I lied about your burns, too.

21:53.913 --> 21:56.447
They're only 25%.
You're gonna live.

21:56.449 --> 21:57.682
Have fun in prison.

21:57.684 --> 21:59.317
Oh, no! God!
Son of a bitch!

21:59.319 --> 22:00.618
I think somebody needs
their catheter changed.

22:00.620 --> 22:01.819
I'll check.
(yelling)

22:01.821 --> 22:03.921
(panting)

22:03.923 --> 22:06.324
SAM:
Be careful
with that stuff.

22:06.326 --> 22:07.692
It's highly corrosive.

22:07.694 --> 22:09.794
(panting)

22:15.967 --> 22:18.669
Matches? Lighter?

22:18.671 --> 22:19.904
Nothing?

22:19.906 --> 22:22.073
Do you?

22:31.116 --> 22:33.050
Try not to
inhale the smoke.

22:33.052 --> 22:35.052
(panting)

22:35.054 --> 22:36.887
You ready?

22:38.857 --> 22:41.058
Light it up.

22:42.728 --> 22:45.696
Fire in the hole.

22:45.698 --> 22:48.766
(pop, hissing)

22:49.534 --> 22:51.535
(beeping)

22:51.537 --> 22:53.971
(rhythmic beeping)

22:53.973 --> 22:55.573
What is that?

22:56.975 --> 22:58.642
It's a fire.

22:58.644 --> 23:00.845
(rhythmic beeping)

23:02.681 --> 23:04.749
(hissing)

23:05.884 --> 23:07.918
(fire roaring, hissing)

23:09.888 --> 23:12.590
Now, G.

23:12.592 --> 23:14.892
(grunting)

23:17.662 --> 23:19.797
Move! Watch out.
It's not working.

23:20.732 --> 23:22.800
(grunts)

23:44.189 --> 23:46.457
(rhythmic beeping)

23:48.593 --> 23:50.928
The hull has been breached.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.763
That is a
leak alarm.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.498
They put a hole in the ship?

23:54.500 --> 23:56.200
Even if that chamber fills
with water,

23:56.202 --> 23:58.669
it won't affect us
or our mission.

23:58.671 --> 24:01.205
Move what you can into the
stern to counterbalance.

24:01.207 --> 24:03.574
Go.
Yeah.

24:03.576 --> 24:05.643
(rhythmic beeping)

24:07.679 --> 24:09.814
(metallic tapping)
(water pouring)

24:09.816 --> 24:11.782
What are you doing?

24:11.784 --> 24:13.484
Morse code.

24:13.486 --> 24:15.653
The Navy's got
to be listening.

24:15.655 --> 24:19.123
Sorry I interrupted your little
game of, uh, Candy Crush there.

24:19.125 --> 24:22.059
I'm writing a letter
to Michelle and the kids.

24:22.061 --> 24:23.627
We're getting out of here, Sam.

24:23.629 --> 24:25.896
In case we don't.

24:25.898 --> 24:27.965
Well, tell her I died
saving your life, will you?

24:27.967 --> 24:29.233
You're joking about a letter

24:29.235 --> 24:30.901
my family's gonna read
after I'm dead.

24:30.903 --> 24:31.969
Too soon?

24:31.971 --> 24:33.237
What's wrong with you?

24:33.239 --> 24:34.839
Never heard of black humor?

24:34.841 --> 24:36.240
Are you trying to make me angry?

24:36.242 --> 24:37.575
'Cause if you are,
it's working.
Good.

24:37.577 --> 24:38.809
I need you angry.

24:38.811 --> 24:39.810
But not at me. At them.

24:39.812 --> 24:40.845
'Cause sooner or later,

24:40.847 --> 24:42.146
they're gonna open that hatch,

24:42.148 --> 24:44.849
and when they do,
we need to be ready to roll.

24:44.851 --> 24:46.050
Was that your plan?

24:46.052 --> 24:47.885
There's no way
they're gonna open that hatch

24:47.887 --> 24:49.687
and risk flooding the bridge.
That's just stupid.

24:49.689 --> 24:52.223
Trust me. I got a good feeling
about this plan.

24:52.225 --> 24:56.894
that the CO2 level buildup will
start affecting your ability

24:56.896 --> 24:58.128
to think straight?

24:58.130 --> 25:02.266
Either they open that hatch,
and we go out firing...

25:02.268 --> 25:04.835
Or we sink.
Or the Navy picks
up on my Morse Code.

25:04.837 --> 25:07.171
Then they<i> torpedo</i> us,
and we sink.
Either way,

25:07.173 --> 25:10.641
we're not letting them
get to San Diego, right?

25:11.910 --> 25:13.911
Right.

25:13.913 --> 25:15.513
(metallic tapping)
What are they doing?

25:15.515 --> 25:16.247
JABRIL:
Those are

25:16.249 --> 25:17.848
the sounds of desperate men.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.550
(tapping continues)

25:19.552 --> 25:21.018
No.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.521
I think that's Morse code.

25:23.523 --> 25:25.222
They're trying
to alert their Navy.

25:25.224 --> 25:29.193
The flooding is slowing
us down even more.

25:29.195 --> 25:30.794
(beeping)
JABRIL:
They must have disconnected

25:30.796 --> 25:32.129
the bilge pump.

25:33.298 --> 25:34.698
We can't risk surfacing.

25:38.003 --> 25:41.739
Divert as much power
as you can to the engines.

25:41.741 --> 25:43.774
Shut off everything else.

25:43.776 --> 25:46.310
Lights?
Lights,

25:46.312 --> 25:48.579
air,

25:48.581 --> 25:50.648
everything.

25:53.285 --> 25:55.553
(sighs)

26:00.559 --> 26:03.127
(whirring down)

26:06.798 --> 26:09.099
I understand, sir.

26:09.101 --> 26:11.569
I was on my way
back to Washington...

26:12.571 --> 26:15.172
Yes, sir.

26:15.174 --> 26:17.308
I<i> will,</i> sir.

26:18.843 --> 26:21.979
Deeks has got an alias and a
possible location for the drugs.

26:21.981 --> 26:23.781
Guy's name is Worm,

26:23.783 --> 26:25.849
aka Richard Miller.

26:25.851 --> 26:27.751
He works
at The Great Wall restaurant

26:27.753 --> 26:29.253
on Sherman Way in Reseda.

26:29.255 --> 26:30.854
Alert the others.

26:30.856 --> 26:34.858
of someone who may have
paid for the sub-- Jabril.

26:34.860 --> 26:37.995
But, uh, it's pretty common,
and I don't have a surname.

26:39.130 --> 26:40.931
And?

26:42.033 --> 26:44.935
And I also picked up
a Naval transmission.

26:46.905 --> 26:50.341
COM-Third-Fleet has launched
the alert 30 ASW package

26:50.343 --> 26:53.344
with two H-60s and a P8A

26:53.346 --> 26:55.913
Poseidon sub hunter,
call sign Talon Five-Five.

26:57.082 --> 26:58.816
Hetty, they have ord...
Have orders

26:58.818 --> 27:01.652
to locate and destroy
the submarine.

27:01.654 --> 27:03.053
I know.

27:04.689 --> 27:06.757
What can we do?

27:09.661 --> 27:11.662
Pray...

27:11.664 --> 27:14.632
loud and hard.

27:17.402 --> 27:19.403
(Ali speaks
native language)

27:31.383 --> 27:34.051
He requires no prayers.

27:35.053 --> 27:37.121
It is permissible.

27:41.393 --> 27:43.727
It is disrespectful.

27:43.729 --> 27:48.365
We need no Salat,
no Ghusl, no Kafan.

27:50.335 --> 27:54.138
We will be buried
in our blood and clothes because

27:54.140 --> 27:57.307
the shaheed is resurrected
on Yawm al-Din.

28:00.445 --> 28:03.013
And the smell of our blood

28:03.015 --> 28:06.784
will be like
the sweetest-smelling musk.

28:13.825 --> 28:15.893
Wire the detonators.

28:21.766 --> 28:23.834
(speaking native language)

28:31.976 --> 28:34.812
So, we got a couple cars
in the back in the...

28:34.814 --> 28:38.082
alley. What the hell happened to
you two? You get in a catfight?

28:38.084 --> 28:40.017
Don't be stupid.
Seriously.

28:40.019 --> 28:40.984
You run into more skinheads?

28:40.986 --> 28:41.919
Yes.
No.

28:43.221 --> 28:45.022
Don't worry about it.
Are they in there?

28:45.024 --> 28:46.790
I didn't get close enough.
There's a dog.

28:46.792 --> 28:48.892
You're afraid of dogs?
I'm not talking

28:48.894 --> 28:50.194
about, like,
a King Charles spaniel.

28:50.196 --> 28:53.497
Actually, you know what?
It maybe have<i> been</i> a hyena.

28:53.499 --> 28:55.099
Was it laughing at you?

28:55.101 --> 28:56.767
Oh.
(laughter)

28:56.769 --> 28:58.769
No, no. What's...
what's that?

28:58.771 --> 29:00.471
I don't... I don't like this.
I don't like that.

29:00.473 --> 29:02.473
Not at all.
Not one bit.

29:02.475 --> 29:04.808
KENSI:
All right.

29:04.810 --> 29:07.077
We'll take the front, you guys
breach the back on our count.

29:07.079 --> 29:08.846
Sounds good.
Okay?

29:08.848 --> 29:10.013
Am I missing something?

29:10.015 --> 29:11.815
Yes, it's called
a cerebral cortex.

29:11.817 --> 29:12.850
(Kensi giggles)

29:14.185 --> 29:16.420
(Kensi and Deeks gasping)

29:16.422 --> 29:18.489
Sorry, we are not open yet.

29:18.491 --> 29:20.157
Oh, no.
We're not here to eat.

29:20.159 --> 29:22.860
I just want to look at this
place for our wedding reception.

29:22.862 --> 29:23.827
We're getting married.

29:23.829 --> 29:25.496
Congratulations.

29:25.498 --> 29:29.133
To be completely honest,
I thought she'd never ask.

29:29.135 --> 29:30.534
What? He's kidding.

29:30.536 --> 29:33.871
DEEKS:
Uh, guilty as charged.
I asked her, but only

29:33.873 --> 29:35.239
after her sister
turned me down.

29:35.241 --> 29:36.840
Would you stop it? She's gonna
think you're serious.

29:36.842 --> 29:38.175
It's not as bad as
it sounds, Madge.

29:38.177 --> 29:39.510
They're identical twins,

29:39.512 --> 29:41.512
and you can only marry one
at a time in this state,

29:41.514 --> 29:43.347
and I wanted a trophy wife,
so, second place it is.

29:43.349 --> 29:45.816
(laughs)
Second place!

29:45.818 --> 29:47.851
You're going
to make a beautiful bride.

29:47.853 --> 29:49.019
I agree.

29:49.021 --> 29:50.988
Mm. Thank you.

29:50.990 --> 29:53.123
But you have to come back
to speak to the manager.

29:53.125 --> 29:55.893
I don't book these things.
KENSI:
Okay, that's okay. We can just

29:55.895 --> 29:57.561
take a quick look around. I...
Sorry, no.

29:57.563 --> 30:00.063
No. I can't have anyone
in here right now.

30:00.065 --> 30:01.298
You are going to have to leave.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.300
I talked to Richard,
Madge, and he said

30:03.302 --> 30:05.903
that you would take
good care of us.
Who?

30:05.905 --> 30:07.971
Richard Miller, aka Worm?

30:07.973 --> 30:10.974
That name doesn't
ring a bell.
Oh, really?

30:10.976 --> 30:13.911
Uh, uh, put down the
scissors. Put 'em down.

30:13.913 --> 30:16.947
Talia, we're a go.
Put down the scissors.

30:16.949 --> 30:19.917
KENSI:
Federal agents! Hands up!

30:21.920 --> 30:22.853
(grunting)

30:22.855 --> 30:24.955
On your knees!
On your knees!

30:24.957 --> 30:26.957
On your knees now.

30:26.959 --> 30:29.827
All clear.

30:29.829 --> 30:33.997
Wow. Remind me never
to get between you two.

30:33.999 --> 30:36.266
Not when you're armed, at least.

30:36.268 --> 30:38.268
Ooh, 100 keys here, easy.

30:38.270 --> 30:40.337
We good?

30:40.339 --> 30:42.272
Yeah.

30:44.876 --> 30:46.109
KENSI:
Hetty, we secured the drugs.

30:46.111 --> 30:47.845
They were still cutting 'em.

30:47.847 --> 30:50.881
Looks like it's all here. Hetty?

30:50.883 --> 30:53.016
I'm afraid
we have another problem.

30:53.018 --> 30:54.418
What sort of problem?
ERIC:
The Navy is

30:54.420 --> 30:55.519
hunting for the sub.

30:55.521 --> 30:56.854
And so they should be.

30:56.856 --> 30:58.188
HETTY:
With orders

30:58.190 --> 30:59.356
to destroy on contact.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.024
DEEKS:
Well, then, you got

31:01.026 --> 31:02.392
to make a phone call
and buy us some time.

31:02.394 --> 31:06.997
I'm afraid I've used up
all my favors in Washington.

31:06.999 --> 31:10.267
I'm persona non grata
at the moment.

31:10.269 --> 31:12.536
What about
the assistant director?

31:12.538 --> 31:13.937
KENSI:
Callen and Sam are on

31:13.939 --> 31:16.506
GRANGER:
I'm well aware of that, Blye.

31:16.508 --> 31:18.575
I will do anything
to get my people back,

31:18.577 --> 31:20.043
but this isn't about them.

31:20.045 --> 31:24.014
It's about what they may be
planning on doing with it.

31:24.016 --> 31:27.017
NELL:
The USS<i> Van Buren</i>
has 508 officers,

31:27.019 --> 31:28.619
3,789

31:28.621 --> 31:30.053
enlisted men on board.

31:30.055 --> 31:32.923
GRANGER:
It also has
two nuclear reactors,

31:32.925 --> 31:36.059
75 aircraft and three million
gallons of aviation fuel.

31:36.061 --> 31:38.462
Not to mention
all the armament

31:38.464 --> 31:40.964
that goes on those planes
and the weapons on the ship.

31:40.966 --> 31:43.233
DEEKS: You got to get us out
there, we got to do something.

31:43.235 --> 31:44.434
Like what?
KENSI: Anything.

31:44.436 --> 31:46.069
Can-Can we get a chopper?
No,

31:46.071 --> 31:48.071
probably not.
But I can.

31:48.073 --> 31:50.107
Grab your gear.

31:50.109 --> 31:51.375
Nice.

31:51.377 --> 31:53.143
Thank you, Owen.

31:54.012 --> 31:57.080
PILOT:
<i>Stand by to launch sonobouy</i>
<i>in three,</i>

31:57.082 --> 31:59.116
two, one.

31:59.118 --> 32:01.184
<i>Launch.</i>

32:09.961 --> 32:11.428
We're diving.

32:11.430 --> 32:14.965
I'm not sure.

32:14.967 --> 32:17.534
No, I can feel it.

32:17.536 --> 32:20.470
(sighs) As the bow takes on
water it pitches forward.

32:20.472 --> 32:24.241
They'll try to compensate,
but the extra drag and weight--

32:24.243 --> 32:26.209
that'd take more power.
Power they don't have

32:26.211 --> 32:28.178
since we disconnected
the batteries.

32:30.148 --> 32:32.582
We may be able to travel forward
bow down without diving,

32:32.584 --> 32:34.685
but eventually
the weight'll win out.

32:34.687 --> 32:36.453
We'll drop like a rock, G.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.956
I love it when
a plan comes together.

32:40.458 --> 32:42.292
And that's where you say, uh,

32:42.294 --> 32:44.561
"I pity the fool
that messes with me."

32:46.064 --> 32:48.966
I'm starting to think I'd have
been better off with Deeks.

32:48.968 --> 32:50.200
(loud thumping)

32:50.202 --> 32:52.135
The hell was that?

32:52.137 --> 32:53.337
That was outside.

32:53.339 --> 32:54.471
Depth charge.

32:54.473 --> 32:56.039
They know we are here.

32:56.041 --> 33:00.210
We are invisible
to the infidels.

33:03.047 --> 33:04.414
<i>Allah Akbar.</i>

33:06.117 --> 33:07.617
<i>Allah Akbar.</i>

33:07.619 --> 33:11.989
(muffled):
<i>Allah Akbar.</i>

33:11.991 --> 33:16.426
It's command activated
to gauge range, bearing

33:16.428 --> 33:18.695
and doppler information
on active sonar contacts.

33:18.697 --> 33:22.199
Meaning the next
explosion's a torpedo?

33:23.401 --> 33:24.701
If they pinged us.

33:26.637 --> 33:28.205
Let's make sure they do.

33:30.174 --> 33:33.143
(clanging)

33:42.720 --> 33:44.788
(clanging)

33:51.295 --> 33:55.098
Hey.

33:55.100 --> 33:57.167
You all right?

33:58.403 --> 33:59.803
I'm fine.

33:59.805 --> 34:03.140
All that muscle mass...

34:03.142 --> 34:05.342
takes up a lot of oxygen.

34:06.310 --> 34:09.646
If we get out of here...

34:09.648 --> 34:12.115
you might want to think
about taking up pilates.

34:12.117 --> 34:15.385
How about you stop talking
to conserve air.

34:20.825 --> 34:22.826
They're gonna open that hatch

34:22.828 --> 34:24.594
any second now.

34:24.596 --> 34:27.130
They better.

34:27.132 --> 34:29.499
'Cause that's about
all we've got left.

34:35.339 --> 34:37.074
How close are we?

34:37.076 --> 34:39.076
NELL: We have no idea what
heading they're on, but based

34:39.078 --> 34:41.445
on the max speed of the sub,
you should be approaching

34:41.447 --> 34:42.546
the furthest they
could have gotten.

34:42.548 --> 34:44.247
But it's
a wide arc.

34:44.249 --> 34:48.185
Beale, can you patch us
into the Navy search aircraft?

34:48.187 --> 34:52.322
Hell, I can try.
I need you to actually do it.

34:52.324 --> 34:53.457
Yes, sir.

34:56.561 --> 34:59.296
(coughing)

34:59.298 --> 35:01.364
(gasping)

35:06.137 --> 35:08.305
(wheezing):
What happens now?

35:08.307 --> 35:11.675
I think this is where
you come up with a plan.

35:14.479 --> 35:16.279
Isn't it your turn to save us?

35:17.448 --> 35:19.449
The flooding is causing
the bow to sink.

35:19.451 --> 35:22.119
We don't have enough
power to counter it.

35:22.121 --> 35:25.322
We have to pump the water out
or we're never gonna make it.

35:25.324 --> 35:28.291
If we open the hatch,
we'll flood the bridge.

35:30.461 --> 35:32.462
We shut off the electricity.

35:32.464 --> 35:33.797
We use the manual controls.

35:33.799 --> 35:36.600
Then we pump
the water out.

35:36.602 --> 35:39.369
After we kill them.

35:44.642 --> 35:47.310
Kensi, you need to circle
back, you've gone further

35:47.312 --> 35:49.412
than the sub could have traveled
in this amount of time.

35:49.414 --> 35:50.413
Copy that.

35:50.415 --> 35:52.582
Let's turn around.

35:57.421 --> 35:59.489
I've got a transmission
from the P8A.
Let's hear it.

35:59.491 --> 36:01.291

36:17.743 --> 36:19.843

36:19.845 --> 36:22.179
Lord have mercy.

36:32.757 --> 36:33.957
Aah!

36:38.563 --> 36:40.330
Kill them.

36:43.267 --> 36:45.335

(alarm beeping)

37:00.551 --> 37:01.851
(grunts)

37:09.694 --> 37:11.595
Can we get this thing
to the surface?

37:11.597 --> 37:12.495
Ah.

37:12.497 --> 37:13.964
It took on too much water

37:13.966 --> 37:15.465
and the power's out.

37:15.467 --> 37:17.534
Our only hope is
a free ascent.

37:19.770 --> 37:21.771
We're not gonna be able
to open that hatch

37:21.773 --> 37:23.907
till the sub fills with water,

37:23.909 --> 37:25.609
the pressure equalizes.

37:25.611 --> 37:27.677
We got to flood it.

37:35.653 --> 37:37.387
Right before we open the hatch,

37:37.389 --> 37:39.923
you have to take in as much
air into your lungs as you can

37:39.925 --> 37:42.392
and then scream all the way
to the surface.

37:42.394 --> 37:43.627
Doesn't sound very manly.

37:43.629 --> 37:45.462
If you don't, the
air will expand

37:45.464 --> 37:46.830
and your lungs will explode.

37:46.832 --> 37:48.665
(laughs)

37:48.667 --> 37:50.734
Let's go, move.

37:56.274 --> 37:59.009
Yes, I understand the threat,
Admiral, but I have two agents

37:59.011 --> 38:02.479
aboard that vessel and I'm just
asking you to try to disable it

38:02.481 --> 38:04.481
as opposed to sinking it.

38:04.483 --> 38:06.549
(man speaking indistinctly
over phone)

38:08.419 --> 38:10.487
Yes, sir.

38:12.056 --> 38:14.324
I understand, sir.

38:20.831 --> 38:23.933
PILOT:

39:34.739 --> 39:37.907

You still thinking about
getting that boat?

39:37.909 --> 39:39.676
You think that's funny, huh?

39:39.678 --> 39:43.513
You remember to grab

39:43.515 --> 39:46.716

Son of a bitch.

39:48.753 --> 39:51.755

ERIC: Come again, Kensi?

40:05.604 --> 40:07.504
KENSI:
Callen and Sam are alive.

40:07.506 --> 40:09.606
I repeat:
Callen and Sam are alive.

40:09.608 --> 40:12.041
They're in the water.

40:28.192 --> 40:30.460
Thanks.

40:32.696 --> 40:35.465
So you're not going
to the boatshed?

40:35.467 --> 40:36.866
I sent Nell.

40:46.143 --> 40:48.445
So what should I tell Washington

40:48.447 --> 40:50.847
when they call to find out
where you are?

40:53.818 --> 40:56.519
I've always been partial
to the truth.

41:02.993 --> 41:06.596
You know, I'm not sure
they know what that is

41:06.598 --> 41:09.866
or even care anymore.

41:10.868 --> 41:13.837
Do you ever feel

41:13.839 --> 41:17.841
you're getting too old for this?

41:18.809 --> 41:21.811
Yeah.

41:21.813 --> 41:24.481
Every damn day.

41:34.658 --> 41:37.193
Looks like you might have
ruptured an eardrum.

41:37.195 --> 41:39.062
What?

41:41.265 --> 41:44.734
You're both lucky you weren't
killed by the concussion.

41:44.736 --> 41:46.569
Damn lucky.
I just came by,
you guys,

41:46.571 --> 41:49.105
to make sure you're okay.
Glad you're doing well.
Oh, yeah,

41:49.107 --> 41:50.773
We do this sort of thing

41:50.775 --> 41:52.275

41:52.277 --> 41:55.945
Oh, never fear,
Dr. Deeks is here.

41:55.947 --> 41:57.847
Nerd Herd, you want
to grab some, uh,

41:57.849 --> 41:58.915
pint glasses over there?

41:58.917 --> 42:00.550
All right.

42:00.552 --> 42:01.751
So, uh,

42:01.753 --> 42:03.720
how are my
little mermaids?
Okay,

42:03.722 --> 42:05.655
on that note,
I should get going.

42:05.657 --> 42:06.956
But, um, guys,

42:06.958 --> 42:08.791
thank you
for everything.

42:08.793 --> 42:10.894

a pleasure working with you.

42:10.896 --> 42:13.897
You-- so good to meet you.
Yeah. Hey.

42:13.899 --> 42:15.965
I'll give you a call,
we'll get together.

42:15.967 --> 42:17.800

KENSI: Aw, don't worry about it.

42:29.848 --> 42:32.148

We got cervezas

42:32.150 --> 42:34.918
