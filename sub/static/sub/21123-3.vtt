in his pocket?</i>

00:55.240 --> 00:58.920

to the stables, I could work it out.</i>

01:03.600 --> 01:05.760
- I've been watching you, Zoe.
- Great.

01:06.360 --> 01:07.520
That's not creepy at all.

01:07.600 --> 01:10.680
You've always been a geek on the inside,
and I've accepted that.

01:10.760 --> 01:13.200
- Do you have to be a geek on the outside?
- Excuse me?

01:13.280 --> 01:15.680
- That hoodie, for example.
- What's wrong with it?

01:16.240 --> 01:20.320
It's warm, light, slightly mysterious.

Watch, learn.
You're gonna need at least a day on this.

01:28.640 --> 01:29.960
- A day?
- Maybe two.

01:31.560 --> 01:33.280
You know what? You're right.

01:34.400 --> 01:36.440
I need to refocus on the real Zoe.

01:36.520 --> 01:37.560
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:37.640 --> 01:41.080
- Great.
- Oh. And if Mom asks...

01:41.160 --> 01:43.080
I'll tell her to stay away.

01:43.160 --> 01:45.400
I can't wait to have a sister

I am not sneaking.

02:13.920 --> 02:15.720
This is how everyone walks in LA.

02:15.800 --> 02:18.600
- It's hip. Get with it.
- Your mother said you couldn't ride.

02:20.480 --> 02:22.520
- I know, but...
- But...

02:23.760 --> 02:25.680
she didn't say you couldn't go
to the stables.

02:25.760 --> 02:28.120

[Becky] Hey, Zoe. How's it going?

02:58.800 --> 03:00.280
[Zoe] Shh. Come here, come here.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.800
Look what I found in Pin's hoodie.

03:04.400 --> 03:05.520
Sedatives.

03:05.600 --> 03:08.320
- These are the ones that were stolen.
- Pin's the thief.

03:08.400 --> 03:11.680
Shh. Careful, I don't think they heard you
out in Iceland.

03:11.760 --> 03:13.160
- Sorry.
- We should go tell Sam.

03:13.240 --> 03:16.800
No, wait, wait, wait. Okay.
Pin is innocent until proven guilty.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.480
- But we need to keep an eye on him.
- There's only one thing for it.

03:20.560 --> 03:22.880
Build a Trojan horse
and follow Pin inside it?

03:22.960 --> 03:25.160
No, Becky. It's time for Badger Cam.

03:27.840 --> 03:30.440
Okay. It's an app I coded.

03:30.960 --> 03:34.080
It was supposed to be
for observing badgers, not spying on boys.

03:34.560 --> 03:37.240
We're not spying.
We're trying to protect the horses.

03:38.160 --> 03:40.640
So, my phone is streaming
from inside the stables.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.600
Ben's is in the courtyard.
I just need you and Becky to join.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.720
If you just click the waving badger...

03:45.800 --> 03:47.680
[gasps] Oh, cute.

03:47.760 --> 03:50.920
So, if Pin does try anything
with the horses, we'll see him.

03:53.800 --> 03:56.200
Okay, Bob's ready for his secret mission.

03:56.280 --> 03:57.640
Great. Let's get out of here.

03:57.720 --> 03:59.840
Wait, no, no.
Hold on, you guys are leaving?

03:59.920 --> 04:02.720
Sorry, Zoe, me and Ben
have to earn our pony-camp fees.

04:02.800 --> 04:06.040
- Guys, I can't guard the horses on my own.
- You're not on your own.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.880
Look, Pin Cam's up and running,
and we'll all be watching.

04:08.960 --> 04:09.960

- Are you meeting anyone?

No, just need to pick up a few things.
Why don't you come?

04:30.800 --> 04:34.520
We both know that shopping in the UK
isn't the same thing as shopping in LA.

Oh, hey. Hey.

My sister has got me watching
all these fashion vlogs.

04:55.040 --> 04:57.920
- You know, I'm all about the fashion.
- You could do with a hat.

04:58.440 --> 05:00.920
- Is that a hot tip for the coming season?
- Riding hat.

05:01.400 --> 05:05.000
Sam's got Major tacked up in the arena.
Says you're on the free-ride list.

05:05.080 --> 05:07.360
Oh, no, no, no,
I'm not going riding today.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.880
Suit yourself. I'll tell her you're busy.

Wait, um... what are you up to?
You got any plans?

Sam's asked me to paint jumps
in the arena.

Oh. Cool.

05:24.040 --> 05:26.200
Oh. You know what? You're right.

05:26.720 --> 05:30.960

whether we still had that leak.

05:56.480 --> 05:58.160
Yup, I need to fix that.

06:02.280 --> 06:04.120
I think Becky and Jade are stalking me.

06:04.680 --> 06:06.560
- I'm sure that's not true.
- I found this.

It's like... It's a map of me, I think.

- without girls following me around.

- That is my butt, right?
- [Marcus] Kind of.

07:42.840 --> 07:46.920
- It's the way you sit in a saddle.
- [Sam] You've never ridden before?

then tell me what she's talking about?

- Yes, it is.

- Of course you are.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.560
Just loosen your hands. Relax the leg.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.720
Excellent. There you go.

11:47.360 --> 11:49.000
Now I'm gonna try you in trot.

- I've got you. He can't go anywhere.

11:52.840 --> 11:53.840
Trot on.

11:57.120 --> 11:59.840
- Just try and relax.
- That's easy for you to say.

Okay, I'm gonna try something.
Now, close your eyes.

12:03.080 --> 12:05.880
- What?
- Just close them.

- The inside of my eyelids.

when you felt really relaxed.

12:15.120 --> 12:16.680
Okay. I'll try.

12:19.520 --> 12:20.560
It was before.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.920
Dad took me hiking in Yellowstone.

12:23.640 --> 12:25.640
The sky was so much bigger there.

12:27.440 --> 12:32.080
My dad says that the sky always
gives you clues to the road ahead.

12:32.680 --> 12:35.360
The rise and fall, where there's water...

12:36.120 --> 12:37.160
where there's rocks.

12:37.240 --> 12:40.040
You are doing so great, Zoe.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.200
Okay. Now, when you're ready...

12:44.320 --> 12:46.640
I want you to lift both hands
out to the side.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.400
[laughs]

12:54.480 --> 12:55.800
Okay, open your eyes.

12:59.160 --> 13:00.160
I'm doing it!

13:09.400 --> 13:10.400
[Mia] Marcus.

13:11.240 --> 13:13.080
- Where have you been?
- Wait a second.

13:13.160 --> 13:16.040
Well, I need you to help me and Firefly
with the jumps.

13:16.360 --> 13:18.600
- You promised.
- Five more minutes, okay?

13:20.560 --> 13:21.680
Wow.

13:27.560 --> 13:28.560
[Zoe] Where's Pin?

13:31.680 --> 13:33.800
- Make him stop. Make him stop.
- Whoa.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.040
- You're doing so well.
- Where is he?

13:36.120 --> 13:37.240
Who? Everyone's here?

13:49.240 --> 13:52.160
Look, I know everyone thinks
you're some sort of riding guru,

13:52.240 --> 13:53.920
but let me tell you something.

13:55.360 --> 13:56.440
Zoe!

14:00.160 --> 14:03.120
Found this.
Someone's been filming the horses.

14:05.440 --> 14:07.120
- Huh.
- Says you're logged in.

14:09.040 --> 14:11.920
Okay. Yeah, so, we set up that camera.

14:12.480 --> 14:14.520
- Why?
- It's stupid, really.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.200
I figured it would be stupid.

14:19.080 --> 14:20.320
We were recording Marcus.

14:20.920 --> 14:23.640
Yeah, Becky and Jade
already record his every move,

14:23.720 --> 14:26.640
so, I thought we could track him
even better on camera.

14:27.800 --> 14:28.800
Don't tell anyone.

14:30.640 --> 14:31.640
I don't have to.

14:33.120 --> 14:34.280
Spying on Marcus?

14:34.960 --> 14:38.160
That is absolutely tragic.
[chuckles softly]

14:38.720 --> 14:39.720
[sighs]

14:41.280 --> 14:44.120
Wow, Bob, you look like a movie star.

14:44.640 --> 14:46.480
- You have a gift.
- I have many.

14:47.760 --> 14:50.760
- So, tell me everything.
- It's all fine.

14:51.240 --> 14:53.480
Your mom definitely wasn't getting
her horoscope.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.600
- She was arranging to meet someone.
- Who?

14:55.680 --> 14:56.960
Honey, something's come up.

14:57.040 --> 14:59.600
- Will you be all right with your friends?
- Where are you going?

15:00.120 --> 15:02.440
Tell Grandpa I'll be back for dinner.
Stay safe.

15:02.520 --> 15:04.880
- Make sure your friends walk you home.
- Thanks.

15:04.960 --> 15:07.040
[Maggie] Hi, can I get a cab
from the pier?

15:07.120 --> 15:08.640
Uh, so, spill.

15:09.480 --> 15:12.200
Some guy called Elliot, I think it was.

15:12.280 --> 15:14.000
- E?
- Mia's dad's called Elliot.

15:14.080 --> 15:18.280
- Wait. So, Elliot is at the stables?
- Mm-hmm.

15:18.360 --> 15:21.720
Whoa, guys, we've got three people
queued up to ride Bob already.

15:21.800 --> 15:23.840
We're gonna have £10 in no time.

15:24.560 --> 15:26.640
- I can't take that.
- Yes, we can.

15:27.840 --> 15:30.560
Okay, people... let's go.

15:31.040 --> 15:33.000
- Go where?
- [Rosie] To the stables, of course.

15:33.080 --> 15:36.000
I figured now that we're friends,
we could go hang out there.

15:36.080 --> 15:38.160
And I'd love to meet some more
of the locals.

15:44.120 --> 15:45.720
[Zoe whispers] Jade, it's me.

15:48.360 --> 15:50.880
Pin cam's been busted.
We're going old-school.

16:55.640 --> 16:56.640
Thief!

16:58.600 --> 17:00.800
- So, you are spying on me.
- Yes, I am.

17:00.880 --> 17:02.920
You're stealing sedatives
to keep your target quiet.

17:03.360 --> 17:07.080
- My target? What are you talking about?
- You're a horse thief. Admit it!

17:07.160 --> 17:09.880
- Or you're working with them.
- You think I'd steal a horse?

17:10.960 --> 17:13.440
He's in here! I caught him.

17:14.320 --> 17:16.360
- What? Are you okay?
- [Zoe] No.

17:17.120 --> 17:19.480
I caught Pin
breaking into the medical cabinet.

17:19.560 --> 17:21.960
He's the one
who's been stealing the sedatives.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.440
I gave you a chance.
This is how you repay me?

17:33.440 --> 17:35.200
- Get Ted.
- He might be involved.

17:36.560 --> 17:39.480
Pin... I'm sorry,
but I think I'd better call the police.

17:43.720 --> 17:44.720
Do it.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
[Raven snorting]

17:58.360 --> 18:00.600
[whinnying]

18:08.840 --> 18:09.840
He's over there.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.360
All right, Pin.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.280
You ready to go?

18:21.080 --> 18:22.760
Do you want me to come with you?

18:23.400 --> 18:24.560
Sam, that'd be great.

18:24.640 --> 18:27.400
- Figured he should have an adult with him.
- Exactly.

18:28.720 --> 18:30.080
Right, let's go.

18:48.280 --> 18:51.520
- Wait, why are the police here?
- What happened? Are you okay?

18:52.480 --> 18:53.480
Yeah.

18:53.880 --> 18:56.080
I caught Pin stealing
from the medicine cabinet.

18:56.160 --> 18:58.960
I can't believe it.
A real-life horse thief, in our yard.

19:00.560 --> 19:03.680
I'd better get Bob to the field
before the drama gets to his head.

19:04.320 --> 19:08.080
- Rosie, what are you doing here?
- Nothing. What are you doing here?

19:08.160 --> 19:10.360
- Where's Mom?
- Mom? Why would Mom be here?

19:11.960 --> 19:14.840
- Where's Elliot?
- He's meeting someone in town.

19:14.920 --> 19:17.400
- Why?
- Nothing.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.280
- [Raven whinnying]
- Raven.

19:27.480 --> 19:29.360
- Whoa, whoa.
- Hey, hey, hey.

19:30.240 --> 19:32.120
- [Marcus] Whoa! Whoa!
- Raven!

19:34.480 --> 19:35.480
Hey, hey, hey.

19:36.520 --> 19:38.360
Okay, Zoe... do your thing.

19:38.440 --> 19:41.720
- Zoe!
- Hey, hey, hey. Raven. Hey.

19:43.040 --> 19:44.120
Calm down. Calm down.

19:44.200 --> 19:46.240
Zoe, do you mind?
You're upsetting my horse.

19:46.320 --> 19:47.360
Mia, cut it out.

19:47.880 --> 19:50.720
- Hey. Raven!
- Looks like someone's lost their gift.

19:50.800 --> 19:53.880
Step back, Zoe. Gentle, boy.
Hang on a second.

19:54.880 --> 19:56.640
- Okay, boy.
- [Raven snorts]

20:01.040 --> 20:03.440
I'm gonna put him in Firefly's stable,
okay?

20:14.840 --> 20:16.360
I said it was Pin all along.

20:17.320 --> 20:19.560
You said it was the Ghost Pony yesterday.

20:19.640 --> 20:20.760
Ah, details.

20:21.960 --> 20:23.920
- [Marcus] I'll just move Raven.
- No.

20:24.040 --> 20:27.040
Leave him there.
Firefly will be fine in the broken one.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.160
Raven's far too sensitive
to spend the night in a drafty stable.

20:31.240 --> 20:33.760
Besides, Firefly is less of a flight risk.

20:35.240 --> 20:37.960
Okay. I said I'd walk these guys
back home.

20:38.880 --> 20:41.440
Oh, gosh! Zoe.

20:42.360 --> 20:43.880
All your dreams are coming true.

20:45.240 --> 20:46.240
Excuse me?

20:47.080 --> 20:49.560
You won't even need those videos
of Marcus anymore.

20:49.640 --> 20:50.840
You've got the real thing.

20:51.480 --> 20:53.960
- What do you mean?
- Oh, they've been spying on you.

20:54.080 --> 20:57.080
[laughs] They even set up cameras
and everything.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.720
[Zoe on recording]
<i>We were recording Marcus.</i>

20:59.800 --> 21:02.480
<i>Yeah, Becky and Jade
already record his every move,</i>

21:02.560 --> 21:05.480
<i>so, I thought we could track him
even better on camera.</i>

21:06.640 --> 21:07.640
[Marcus scoffs]

21:10.280 --> 21:12.480
- We were tracking <i>Pin.</i>
- [Marcus] I don't believe this.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.480
[scoffs] Okay. Rosie.

21:17.040 --> 21:18.680
[Mia] They're just kids, Marcus.

21:19.800 --> 21:21.400
They can't help themselves.

21:30.280 --> 21:31.320
[rattling nearby]

21:32.680 --> 21:34.440
Thinking of setting up camp out there?

21:38.160 --> 21:39.160
Sleepover?

21:42.520 --> 21:44.800
Okay, come on, spill it.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.280
Why were you at the stables today?

21:49.320 --> 21:50.960
I was looking for Mom.

21:52.800 --> 21:53.880
I...

21:55.760 --> 21:57.480
I think she's moving on.

21:58.360 --> 22:02.520
- [scoffs] Moving on? From what?
- From Dad.

22:04.200 --> 22:06.960
And before you say everything's fine,
I know it isn't.

22:07.320 --> 22:10.480
- I know they've been having problems.
- Hey, come here.

22:11.400 --> 22:15.360
Okay, so, I'll tell you what I know,
which is basically zilch.

22:15.440 --> 22:18.440
Okay, fine, treat me like a little kid.

22:19.960 --> 22:23.640
- Just like everyone else does.
- Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. All right.

22:26.800 --> 22:31.160
I know that they've argued.
And I know it's been going on for a while.

22:31.240 --> 22:35.400
But I have no idea what it means...
like, now.

22:35.960 --> 22:38.600
Just... I wish we could go back home.

22:40.520 --> 22:43.200
If we went back home,
we could make them work things out.

22:44.960 --> 22:47.880
- I can make people do things, you know.
- Oh, I know.

22:47.960 --> 22:50.640
[laughs] It's like my secret talent.

22:50.720 --> 22:52.720
[clicks tongue] Hmm...

22:52.920 --> 22:53.760
Not so secret.

22:53.840 --> 22:55.000
[giggles]

22:56.320 --> 22:57.320
But I can help them.

22:59.120 --> 23:03.120
And they'll get back together
and be happy forever, and that'll be good.

23:04.960 --> 23:05.960
I'll be so good.

23:07.400 --> 23:08.440
I promise.

23:08.520 --> 23:10.800
Rosie, okay, look at me.

23:11.320 --> 23:15.080
This... is not your fault or my fault.

23:15.760 --> 23:17.840
And it's not something
we can help them with.

23:21.240 --> 23:23.320
I should have known
you were worried about Mom.

23:24.440 --> 23:26.680
Yeah, well,
you're not exactly Mystic Miranda.

23:27.400 --> 23:29.200
No, but I am your big sister.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.760
It's my job to look after you.

23:31.840 --> 23:34.440
So, from now on, we stick together.

23:35.440 --> 23:38.440
- Sisters forever.
- Sisters forever. [chuckles]

23:39.200 --> 23:41.640
Even if you do insist
on doing boring things

23:41.720 --> 23:43.520
like reading and horse riding.

23:44.200 --> 23:45.240
[sirens wailing]

23:47.920 --> 23:49.120
Something's happening.

23:50.600 --> 23:52.760
- It's at the stables.
- You should go.

23:53.320 --> 23:55.160
I'll cover for you. Just go.

24:00.920 --> 24:03.600
- Thank you.
- That's what little sisters are for.

24:11.440 --> 24:12.440
Raven!

24:14.280 --> 24:16.120
[Mia]
They came in though the back field.

24:16.920 --> 24:19.320
- Who did?
- The thieves.

24:21.080 --> 24:22.080
[sniffles] He's gone.

24:25.360 --> 24:26.440
Firefly's gone.

24:28.720 --> 24:29.720
They took him.
