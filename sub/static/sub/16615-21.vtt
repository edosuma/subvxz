Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...

00:01.984 --> 00:05.068
The Evil Queen sent everyone
from the Enchanted Forest here.

00:05.093 --> 00:06.058
That's what you're going with?

00:06.093 --> 00:07.359
It's true.

00:07.394 --> 00:08.994
- How long will you be with us?
- A week.

00:09.030 --> 00:09.928
It's your destiny.

00:09.964 --> 00:12.397
You're gonna bring
back the happy endings.

00:12.432 --> 00:13.965
I do hope you like apples.

00:14.000 --> 00:14.766
It's poison.

00:14.801 --> 00:15.928
You may not believe in the curse,

00:15.953 --> 00:17.334
but I believe in you.

00:18.499 --> 00:19.498
Henry!

00:19.523 --> 00:21.806
Every story in this
book actually happened.

00:21.831 --> 00:23.330
Goodbye, Emma.

00:24.666 --> 00:26.733
Henry, you were right about the curse.

00:26.768 --> 00:28.000
I should've believed you.

00:33.206 --> 00:35.840
I love you, Henry.

00:41.304 --> 00:43.548
This might be the most
important mission yet...

00:43.584 --> 00:45.016
Operation Best Man.

Wake up. Wake up, honey. Wake up.

01:26.821 --> 01:28.441
What is it, Father?

01:28.466 --> 01:30.301
It's time. They found us.

01:30.326 --> 01:32.959
Don't be frightened. It'll be all right.

01:32.994 --> 01:34.727
I'll stay behind, give
you time to escape.

01:34.763 --> 01:37.529
No, I won't leave you.
I'll help you fight.

01:37.565 --> 01:39.330
No, no. You can't.

01:39.366 --> 01:41.399
You have to make sure it stays safe.

01:41.434 --> 01:42.625
You have it, don't you?

01:42.650 --> 01:44.549
Of course.

01:44.704 --> 01:46.238
It never leaves my side.

01:46.273 --> 01:47.405
Oh, good.

01:48.274 --> 01:50.876
It may be the realm's only
hope of defeating the darkness.

01:50.911 --> 01:52.878
I will guard it with my life.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.479
It won't come to that. Now, come on.

01:56.548 --> 01:58.614
You need to get to safety.

01:59.247 --> 02:00.851
You need to share these stories.

02:01.191 --> 02:03.157
But who will believe them?

02:04.223 --> 02:06.257
Someday... someone will.

02:07.459 --> 02:08.324
Daddy!

02:08.360 --> 02:10.193
Don't worry about me. You need to go!

02:10.229 --> 02:11.195
I...

02:11.230 --> 02:12.762
I know. I know.

02:12.798 --> 02:14.730
Me too.

02:14.766 --> 02:16.432
Go! Go!

02:41.973 --> 02:43.873
The Black Fairy's curse!

02:43.908 --> 02:45.108
It's here!

02:47.754 --> 02:49.299
Where do you think it's taking us?

02:49.324 --> 02:50.656
Doesn't matter.

02:50.681 --> 02:54.016
Wherever we end up, we're gonna win.

03:58.211 --> 04:00.544
Archie! Hey, Archie!

04:00.579 --> 04:02.113
What happened here?! What's going on?

04:02.148 --> 04:03.981
What did the Black Fairy's curse do?

04:05.084 --> 04:06.851
Really, Henry?

04:06.886 --> 04:09.253
Black Fairy? Curse?

04:09.289 --> 04:11.221
Henry, I-I-I thought
we were past all this.

04:12.327 --> 04:15.174
She's done something to
you, to... to everyone.

04:16.261 --> 04:17.459
Henry, um...

04:17.495 --> 04:19.262
do I need to schedule
another appointment?

04:19.298 --> 04:20.897
- Where is she?
- Who?

04:20.933 --> 04:22.732
You know who. Where's my mom?

04:23.735 --> 04:24.701
Henry...

04:25.580 --> 04:26.751
you know exactly

04:26.776 --> 04:27.842
where Emma is.

04:27.995 --> 04:29.104
She's in the same place

04:29.140 --> 04:30.105
that she's been

04:30.141 --> 04:32.143
for the last two years.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.054
Emma?

04:50.293 --> 04:51.821
You have a visitor.

04:52.232 --> 04:53.665
Your son.

05:07.019 --> 05:07.902
Mom.

05:07.934 --> 05:09.066
Henry.

05:10.859 --> 05:12.358
Thank God you remember me.

05:12.393 --> 05:13.570
Of course I remember you.

05:13.595 --> 05:15.304
Good, 'cause I just
looked all over town,

05:15.312 --> 05:17.112
and I couldn't find the
rest of our family...

05:17.147 --> 05:18.413
Snow, David, Hook.

05:18.448 --> 05:20.014
- No, no. Stop.
- What?

05:20.049 --> 05:21.916
I'm not going down that road again.

05:22.131 --> 05:24.734
I've worked way too hard
for you to undo my progress.

05:25.180 --> 05:26.133
Progress?

05:26.158 --> 05:28.125
You know what I mean.

05:30.238 --> 05:31.170
Those people...

05:31.195 --> 05:32.726
Snow White, Prince
Charming, Captain Hook...

05:32.751 --> 05:34.028
none of them are real.

05:34.063 --> 05:35.662
My parents are not
fairy-tale characters.

05:35.698 --> 05:37.664
No one in Storybrooke
is. There's no curse.

05:37.962 --> 05:39.962
This is just a regular town.

05:39.987 --> 05:41.769
Mom... what happened to you?

05:41.804 --> 05:43.437
What happened to me
is I'm getting better.

05:43.472 --> 05:45.510
I ended up in this nuthouse
because I believed you

05:45.535 --> 05:47.841
back then, bought into all of it.

05:47.877 --> 05:49.676
No, this is the Black Fairy.

05:49.712 --> 05:51.612
She said she would
take away your family,

05:51.647 --> 05:52.478
and this is how.

05:52.514 --> 05:55.194
- She cursed you.
- No! No more curses.

05:55.917 --> 05:56.982
I just...

05:57.764 --> 05:59.983
want to get well so that maybe...

06:00.857 --> 06:02.289
Maybe I can be your mother.

06:02.553 --> 06:03.453
Okay.

06:03.478 --> 06:05.190
How long have you been a patient here?

06:05.226 --> 06:06.626
You know how long I've been here.

06:08.062 --> 06:09.994
Maybe it'll help if you relive it.

06:11.580 --> 06:13.791
Ever since you tried to prove
that fairy tales were real

06:13.816 --> 06:15.510
by eating a poisoned apple turnover.

06:15.535 --> 06:17.245
You ended up in the hospital for weeks.

06:17.270 --> 06:18.268
You barely made it through.

06:18.293 --> 06:20.251
No, that's not how it happened.

06:20.276 --> 06:22.580
Don't you remember? I
did eat the turnover,

06:22.605 --> 06:24.079
but you fought a dragon

06:24.104 --> 06:26.025
and woke me with true love's kiss.

06:26.050 --> 06:28.479
- Oh, my God. Henry, stop!
- You woke me, a-and you...

06:28.549 --> 06:29.932
This is crazy.

06:30.002 --> 06:32.169
You're the one who's
supposed to be getting better.

06:32.329 --> 06:34.454
- Don't go back.
- But it's true.

06:34.479 --> 06:35.899
Henry, you were not saved by a kiss.

06:35.924 --> 06:37.107
That's ridiculous.

06:37.142 --> 06:38.608
You were saved by medicine, by Dr. Whale

06:38.643 --> 06:40.243
and by... hospital.

06:40.278 --> 06:41.244
It's time.

06:42.572 --> 06:43.746
Stop it.

06:43.781 --> 06:46.716
You can't take that.
You can't take anything.

06:47.189 --> 06:50.057
It might be how the Black Fairy
is keeping you from remembering.

06:50.329 --> 06:51.482
Henry, just let me...

06:51.518 --> 06:53.083
- Look.
- Oh. Okay.

06:53.119 --> 06:54.220
This page I wrote...

06:54.245 --> 06:56.286
It means that the
Final Battle is coming.

06:56.955 --> 06:59.080
The key to winning it is in here.

06:59.105 --> 07:03.741
But we can't do that
until you start believing.

07:05.631 --> 07:06.963
Sorry about him.

07:09.389 --> 07:10.488
You have to stop doing that,

07:10.524 --> 07:12.757
or your mother's not gonna
let you keep visiting me.

07:13.412 --> 07:15.627
Regina. She's here?

07:15.662 --> 07:16.857
Who's Regina?

07:16.882 --> 07:19.249
Henry.

07:19.332 --> 07:20.998
There's my boy.

07:21.023 --> 07:22.522
Hmm.

07:22.801 --> 07:25.100
Madame Mayor, I'm sorry.

07:25.125 --> 07:26.336
I didn't know he was coming today.

07:26.372 --> 07:28.539
How many times have I told you?

07:28.574 --> 07:30.407
It's Fiona.

07:30.818 --> 07:32.996
No need for titles here.

07:33.021 --> 07:34.254
Hmm.

07:34.798 --> 07:36.160
Now, Henry...

07:36.587 --> 07:38.105
shouldn't you be at school?

07:38.309 --> 07:39.409
Of course.

07:39.444 --> 07:41.644
I just wanted to see my... other mom.

07:42.551 --> 07:43.846
What's that?

07:43.881 --> 07:45.448
Where did you find that?

07:45.483 --> 07:47.526
Oh, no. I think I'll hold onto this.

07:47.551 --> 07:50.307
Nothing but trouble seems
to come from this book.

07:50.332 --> 07:51.698
Hmm.

07:52.768 --> 07:54.721
Now, Henry, back to school.

07:54.746 --> 07:56.323
I'll see you at dinner.

07:57.089 --> 07:59.128
Emma and I have some
business to discuss.

07:59.153 --> 08:00.653
Okay, Mom.

08:04.706 --> 08:07.401
Whatever she wants
you to do, don't do it.

08:15.484 --> 08:16.741
Now then...

08:16.766 --> 08:19.304
I think somebody needs
to take their medicine.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.600
David.

08:50.623 --> 08:52.056
Yeah, I'm okay.

08:57.350 --> 08:58.583
No.

08:59.061 --> 09:00.961
No. Emma?

09:00.996 --> 09:02.263
Emma?!

09:03.070 --> 09:05.532
She's gone.

09:05.568 --> 09:08.201
The fairy... she's as good as her word.

09:08.237 --> 09:09.813
She ripped us apart.

09:09.838 --> 09:11.837
Ripped us apart?! Where
the blazes are we?!

09:12.492 --> 09:14.774
This is... our palace.

09:14.809 --> 09:16.142
What now?

09:16.285 --> 09:18.151
We're in the Enchanted Forest.

09:18.383 --> 09:21.350
Well, she has panache,
I'll give her that.

09:21.945 --> 09:24.450
She took you from
your wedding to theirs.

09:24.486 --> 09:26.152
This is where we got married.

09:26.453 --> 09:28.765
Right before we were cursed.

09:28.833 --> 09:31.444
Henry? Henry?!

09:31.492 --> 09:32.476
Henry?!

09:32.501 --> 09:34.367
- Hey.
- Where is he?

09:34.710 --> 09:36.210
We'll find him.

09:36.245 --> 09:39.421
If she thinks she can
rip this family apart...

09:39.800 --> 09:41.800
curses have never stopped us before.

09:42.112 --> 09:44.245
Today will be no different.

09:44.981 --> 09:47.915
We'll get Emma and Henry back.

09:47.950 --> 09:49.416
Wherever they may be.

09:50.838 --> 09:52.804
Hey, guys. I'm fine, really.

09:52.829 --> 09:55.466
Uh, all due respect, Emma,
but you do seem quite agitated.

09:55.491 --> 09:57.758
- Not at all.
- Are you sure, dear?

09:57.793 --> 09:58.911
Yes, really.

09:58.936 --> 10:00.160
Everything is okay.

10:00.195 --> 10:02.300
Well, I just came to
check on your progress.

10:02.325 --> 10:03.589
As mayor of Storybrooke,

10:03.614 --> 10:05.634
can you blame me for
taking a keen interest

10:05.659 --> 10:06.900
in all of our residents?

10:06.925 --> 10:08.691
All of your "troubled" residents.

10:08.998 --> 10:12.291
All due respect, Dr.
Hopper and Madame Mayor,

10:12.316 --> 10:14.496
I know exactly what
this is really about.

10:15.191 --> 10:16.737
Do you now?

10:19.436 --> 10:20.768
Henry.

10:22.468 --> 10:23.609
Oh, yes.

10:23.634 --> 10:27.218
Well, you are his biological
mother, and he is my son,

10:27.243 --> 10:29.476
so perhaps there is a
bit more to my interest.

10:30.094 --> 10:31.782
I don't think that's any secret.

10:31.821 --> 10:33.754
- I feel so loved.
- Uh, sarcasm aside,

10:33.789 --> 10:35.622
Emma has been doing quite well of late.

10:35.657 --> 10:36.938
Wonderful.

10:36.963 --> 10:40.565
Dr. Hopper's reports
are very encouraging.

10:40.710 --> 10:43.276
I don't think I'm talking out of school

10:43.312 --> 10:47.614
to say you might be
eligible for release soon.

10:48.022 --> 10:50.116
Wouldn't it be nice to
paint a different view

10:50.152 --> 10:53.118
than these dreary, old hospital grounds?

10:53.154 --> 10:54.936
We are working on the landscaping.

10:54.961 --> 10:57.490
Perhaps even the Boston skyline?

10:57.515 --> 10:59.222
As I recall, you had a lovely apartment

10:59.247 --> 11:00.529
overlooking it all.

11:00.554 --> 11:02.821
Wouldn't it be nice to go back?

11:03.300 --> 11:05.050
Yeah. It would be nice.

11:05.075 --> 11:06.699
Good.

11:06.871 --> 11:08.519
Because it's not just your well-being

11:08.544 --> 11:09.525
that I'm concerned with.

11:09.550 --> 11:10.479
It's Henry's.

11:10.534 --> 11:12.668
He's clearly still
clinging to the delusion

11:12.704 --> 11:14.104
that these stories are real.

11:14.129 --> 11:16.276
Now, I'd hoped we were past all that.

11:18.209 --> 11:20.309
But now, thanks to you,
I have a 14-year-old boy

11:20.344 --> 11:22.254
- who still believed in fairy tales.
- Hey!

11:22.279 --> 11:25.006
Madame Mayor, please.
This is terribly delicate.

11:25.564 --> 11:29.673
Sorry. I just get so emotional
when it comes to my son.

11:29.698 --> 11:31.486
I never meant to do any harm.

11:31.511 --> 11:32.587
Of course you didn't.

11:32.611 --> 11:37.556
But as luck would have it,
his book has given me an idea

11:37.581 --> 11:40.883
of how we could cure him
of all of this nonsense.

11:40.918 --> 11:43.285
What are you talking about?
What do you want me to do?

11:43.823 --> 11:45.251
Burn it.

11:45.276 --> 11:48.124
Show him that you've
truly embraced reality

11:48.159 --> 11:49.524
and then he will.

11:52.663 --> 11:56.524
Because belief in something,
something that isn't real,

11:56.633 --> 11:58.133
can be dangerous.

12:04.118 --> 12:05.606
No. I'm sorry.

12:06.843 --> 12:08.109
No?

12:08.145 --> 12:09.814
Look, I know all these stories are fake,

12:09.839 --> 12:11.034
but I can't destroy this.

12:11.059 --> 12:12.823
It means so much to
Henry. He'd be crushed.

12:12.848 --> 12:15.481
Well, that's the point...
to crush his delusions...

12:15.874 --> 12:17.323
and yours.

12:18.836 --> 12:20.201
I...

12:22.408 --> 12:24.212
I'm not ready for that.

12:25.044 --> 12:26.009
Really?

12:26.045 --> 12:29.012
You might not be ready
now, but you will be.

12:29.048 --> 12:32.215
Of that, I am quite certain.

12:32.250 --> 12:35.318
Dr. Hopper will hold onto
it until that day comes.

12:35.502 --> 12:37.152
And it will...

12:38.352 --> 12:40.452
because, Miss Swan...

12:41.993 --> 12:44.193
until you're ready to destroy the book

12:44.229 --> 12:47.997
and make a clean break
from this fantasy world,

12:48.032 --> 12:49.665
you'll remain locked up.

12:52.793 --> 12:54.125
- Emma!
- Emma!

12:54.185 --> 12:56.819
- Oh, that bitch.
- She's taunting us.

12:56.854 --> 12:58.542
Get her back. It's your mirror.

12:58.567 --> 13:00.255
Which she is controlling.

13:00.291 --> 13:01.489
Why? What is she doing?

13:03.208 --> 13:04.626
It's the Final Battle.

13:04.661 --> 13:07.356
The Final Battle? In a nuthouse?

13:07.381 --> 13:09.663
Well, clearly, it wasn't
what we thought it was.

13:09.699 --> 13:10.794
Clearly.

13:10.896 --> 13:13.140
Her soul. She's the Savior.

13:13.175 --> 13:15.577
Of course the Final Battle isn't a war.

13:16.202 --> 13:19.847
It's a battle for her soul,
for her belief, her hope.

13:20.186 --> 13:21.108
I don't get it.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.131
What does she gain if
Emma stops believing?

13:23.686 --> 13:25.184
I think I might know.

13:26.755 --> 13:27.687
Zelena.

13:27.712 --> 13:29.121
What is she doing here?

13:29.157 --> 13:30.938
Helping, thank you very much.

13:30.963 --> 13:33.125
The Mad Hatter's hat.

13:33.161 --> 13:34.924
W-Wasn't it destroyed?

13:34.949 --> 13:37.464
Well, he was a hatter. He had multiples.

13:37.499 --> 13:39.678
Inside are portals to every realm.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.850
I used it to escape Oz.

13:41.875 --> 13:42.773
Escape?

13:42.803 --> 13:44.842
Why did you need to
escape your own realm?

13:44.867 --> 13:46.705
Look, there isn't much time.

13:46.944 --> 13:49.074
It's easier if I show you.

14:06.625 --> 14:08.981
If you want to know what
we were running from...

14:09.006 --> 14:10.472
take a gander.

14:15.858 --> 14:17.090
There's nothing there.

14:18.961 --> 14:21.028
I can see that.

14:21.063 --> 14:23.163
When I left Oz, it was falling apart...

14:23.198 --> 14:24.765
Apocalyptic, but now...

14:24.800 --> 14:26.633
- It's erased.
- Like it never existed.

14:26.669 --> 14:29.101
What the bloody hell does
this got to do with Emma?

14:29.137 --> 14:30.602
This is what she's doing.

14:31.539 --> 14:34.140
It's why she wants Emma
to destroy the book.

14:38.680 --> 14:40.846
As the Savior's belief fades...

14:42.183 --> 14:43.849
so do all the realms of story.

14:47.353 --> 14:49.120
If we don't stop the Black Fairy...

14:50.490 --> 14:52.523
all the realms will be destroyed...

14:53.994 --> 14:56.360
and everyone in them.

15:21.976 --> 15:23.742
Who's here, Papa?

15:27.085 --> 15:30.552
Just checking everything
is as it should be.

15:32.490 --> 15:33.951
You know what they say...

15:33.976 --> 15:35.646
A mayor's work is never done.

15:35.775 --> 15:37.295
Madame Mayor...

15:38.309 --> 15:39.542
an honor.

15:41.355 --> 15:43.026
I brought you lunch,

15:43.051 --> 15:45.152
and a little job if you'll take it.

15:45.176 --> 15:47.058
My wristwatch stopped.

15:47.083 --> 15:49.027
Guess I'm not good for timepieces.

15:49.168 --> 15:50.768
We'll figure out that
clock tower one day.

15:50.793 --> 15:51.541
Don't worry.

15:51.566 --> 15:53.340
And I'll get working
on the watch right away.

15:53.715 --> 15:55.039
Thank you.

15:55.792 --> 15:57.214
- Thanks for lunch.
- Mm-hmm.

15:57.239 --> 16:00.010
Your favorite oatmeal raisin
cookies are in there, too.

16:00.045 --> 16:01.978
Oh, thank you.

16:03.652 --> 16:05.481
You're very kind,

16:05.517 --> 16:07.550
always thinking of Gideon.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.937
Well, when someone's
lost their mother...

16:12.004 --> 16:14.404
I feel a need to step into that void.

16:15.626 --> 16:17.392
And how are you doing?

16:17.427 --> 16:20.495
I know this time of
year can be difficult.

16:21.169 --> 16:22.665
Yes.

16:23.154 --> 16:24.435
It is hard,

16:24.460 --> 16:26.833
thinking of Belle on our anniversary...

16:27.493 --> 16:28.802
given what happened.

16:28.827 --> 16:32.029
Yes, it's terribly sad.

16:33.892 --> 16:35.525
So sad.

16:37.295 --> 16:38.261
Thank you.

16:41.016 --> 16:43.877
Well, I'll be back for the watch later.

16:44.158 --> 16:47.170
I always know I can count on you.

16:49.294 --> 16:50.877
And please...

16:51.862 --> 16:53.562
if there's anything I can do.

16:53.597 --> 16:55.764
After all, for my boys...

16:55.800 --> 16:58.033
I'm always here to help.

16:59.369 --> 17:01.303
I saw someone from Arendelle just now.

17:01.338 --> 17:03.338
They still had snow on their shoulders.

17:03.373 --> 17:04.204
What?

17:04.241 --> 17:06.674
How far is this nightmare spreading?

17:06.709 --> 17:08.108
Far.

17:08.832 --> 17:10.866
Jasmine, Aladdin?

17:10.901 --> 17:13.068
It hit Agrabah... whatever it is.

17:13.104 --> 17:16.137
We barely got our people
out. What's going on?

17:16.173 --> 17:18.310
The Black Fairy's doing this
all the way from Storybrooke.

17:18.336 --> 17:20.236
She's attacking Emma's belief.

17:20.261 --> 17:23.303
The more she loses faith,
the realms of story fade away.

17:23.328 --> 17:25.967
We need to get back
there and stop all this.

17:25.992 --> 17:27.936
What about the portal we
just came through, the hat?

17:27.962 --> 17:30.718
It can't make a passage
to a land without magic.

17:30.815 --> 17:32.115
We need something else.

17:33.100 --> 17:34.117
I have it.

17:34.873 --> 17:36.238
I mean, I think I have it.

17:36.274 --> 17:38.641
I might have a theory where to look.

17:38.677 --> 17:41.376
- We don't need theories.
- So, you don't want my help?

17:41.411 --> 17:42.928
Well, all due respect, Captain,

17:42.953 --> 17:46.347
but what we need right now is magic.

17:46.383 --> 17:48.090
And that's my area.

17:48.115 --> 17:50.917
It's time I get to work
and do what I do best.

17:51.086 --> 17:53.787
We need to get out of this
hat and back to my castle.

17:58.376 --> 18:00.842
I don't care what
kind of magic it takes,

18:00.867 --> 18:03.234
I'm getting Henry and Emma back.

18:19.781 --> 18:20.848
Henry?

18:20.873 --> 18:22.030
What the hell? How'd you get in here?

18:22.055 --> 18:24.222
Dr. Hopper really needs to
keep an eye on his wallet.

18:24.257 --> 18:25.723
- Come on.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:25.758 --> 18:27.558
You serious? A jailbreak, kid?

18:27.593 --> 18:28.359
You don't belong here.

18:28.394 --> 18:29.760
And no matter what the mayor says,

18:29.795 --> 18:31.427
she's never letting you out.

18:31.463 --> 18:32.536
But I am.

18:32.561 --> 18:33.919
Welcome to Operation Cuckoo's Nest.

18:33.944 --> 18:35.122
I haven't seen the movie in a long time,

18:35.147 --> 18:36.350
but didn't that end with a lobotomy?

18:36.366 --> 18:37.139
Just...

18:37.163 --> 18:38.929
We have to get out of here
before the nurse comes back.

18:38.964 --> 18:40.598
Come on. We have to go.

18:40.633 --> 18:42.166
Come on!

18:48.278 --> 18:49.511
Bloody hell.

18:53.073 --> 18:55.102
It's taller than I remembered.

18:56.603 --> 18:57.502
Hey!

18:59.340 --> 19:01.407
Next time you sneak
off on a secret mission,

19:01.442 --> 19:03.673
you might want to make sure
there's no Munchkins around.

19:03.743 --> 19:04.626
They're easily bought.

19:04.651 --> 19:06.244
Honestly, stealth wasn't a priority...

19:06.279 --> 19:07.025
Speed was.

19:07.048 --> 19:09.414
So this is your theory
on how to get home, huh?

19:09.450 --> 19:11.150
Hoping there's a magic bean up there?

19:11.380 --> 19:13.447
There's only one way to find out.

19:16.657 --> 19:19.158
Hook, that beanstalk's
over 1,000 feet high.

19:19.193 --> 19:20.621
You really think you
can climb that alone?

19:20.646 --> 19:22.222
I think I want to get back to my wife.

19:22.246 --> 19:24.480
But making her a widow is
not what I'd call a good plan.

19:24.505 --> 19:25.916
You're gonna get yourself killed.

19:25.941 --> 19:27.416
I'll have you know
I've scaled this before.

19:27.451 --> 19:29.184
Really? When?

19:29.511 --> 19:31.453
With Emma.

19:31.489 --> 19:33.121
It was our first adventure together,

19:33.146 --> 19:35.524
though my motives were
less than chivalrous then.

19:35.559 --> 19:38.071
Yeah, I seem to recall you
trying to kill her and Snow.

19:38.096 --> 19:40.079
Granted, it was hardly
love at first sight.

19:40.104 --> 19:42.922
But... things changed.

19:42.931 --> 19:44.124
- We changed.
- I know, but...

19:44.149 --> 19:46.460
Look, we made each
other better! All right?

19:46.485 --> 19:49.169
Emma and I were never a
predestined love story,

19:49.205 --> 19:51.190
guaranteed a happy ending.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.740
We fought for our love, and we won.

19:55.042 --> 19:55.908
And you...

19:55.933 --> 19:58.033
You of all people
should understand that.

19:59.662 --> 20:00.854
But now...

20:01.839 --> 20:03.105
you saw into that mirror.

20:03.140 --> 20:04.306
She doesn't even remember who I am.

20:04.342 --> 20:05.174
So, yes,

20:05.199 --> 20:06.439
I'm gonna climb this beanstalk,

20:06.464 --> 20:08.331
and I am gonna find that bean...

20:09.313 --> 20:11.267
because I'm not gonna
lose everything I have

20:11.292 --> 20:14.894
just because some bitter fairy
cast another bloody curse!

20:17.688 --> 20:19.321
Our story began on the beanstalk,

20:19.356 --> 20:21.123
and I'll be damned
if it ends there, too.

20:22.726 --> 20:24.336
All right.

20:25.084 --> 20:27.917
You're scared of
losing Emma. I get that.

20:28.156 --> 20:29.264
Just

20:29.335 --> 20:31.135
take a deep breath.

20:31.160 --> 20:32.527
All right, calm down.

20:32.842 --> 20:34.460
Let's go get that bean together.

20:44.906 --> 20:47.007
Come on. I've got to show you something.

20:48.699 --> 20:49.648
Okay, well,

20:49.673 --> 20:51.005
unless we're waiting for a helicopter,

20:51.047 --> 20:51.912
I think we went the wrong way.

20:51.948 --> 20:53.948
We're here because
this is the last place

20:53.983 --> 20:55.516
you saw your family.

20:55.552 --> 20:58.852
The last place you remembered
who you really are...

20:58.888 --> 20:59.954
The Savior.

20:59.989 --> 21:01.821
Mom, it's true.

21:01.856 --> 21:04.324
Henry, you have to accept
these things are not real.

21:04.359 --> 21:06.826
And bringing me to some
rooftop is not gonna convince me

21:06.861 --> 21:08.295
that my mother is Snow White.

21:08.330 --> 21:09.624
But she is.

21:09.649 --> 21:11.421
And this isn't just some rooftop.

21:11.507 --> 21:14.474
This is where you married
your true love yesterday.

21:14.510 --> 21:16.376
My true love? Sorry, kid.

21:16.411 --> 21:17.510
That's not the way the world works.

21:17.545 --> 21:19.012
It does, and it did for you.

21:19.047 --> 21:21.313
You married Captain Hook right here.

21:21.349 --> 21:23.582
Captain Hook? Who
officiated... Tinker Bell?

21:23.618 --> 21:26.418
No. Jiminy Cricket. It was amazing!

21:26.454 --> 21:28.521
The aisle was right here...

21:28.818 --> 21:30.356
where your parents gave you away.

21:30.811 --> 21:32.795
The only time they gave me
away was when I was a baby.

21:32.820 --> 21:34.285
Mom, stop it.

21:34.427 --> 21:36.561
They walked you to the altar.

21:36.874 --> 21:38.830
That's where you exchanged vows,

21:38.866 --> 21:42.400
in front of all your friends
and family who love you.

21:42.646 --> 21:45.547
This is it. Mom, come on!

21:56.820 --> 21:59.788
What happened? Mom,
did you see something?

21:59.823 --> 22:01.153
I don't know.

22:01.209 --> 22:03.376
That's a yes. It worked. I knew it.

22:03.412 --> 22:05.211
Henry, I don't know what I saw.

22:05.246 --> 22:07.005
I've been in a mental
hospital for years.

22:07.030 --> 22:10.531
It's not like my brain is
really trustworthy right now.

22:10.785 --> 22:13.652
This is the curse. She
wants you to doubt yourself.

22:13.688 --> 22:16.659
But you can't give
in. You have to fight.

22:16.684 --> 22:18.156
I don't want to fight.

22:18.729 --> 22:20.823
I want to go home to Boston.

22:20.848 --> 22:22.815
Storybrooke is your home.

22:22.994 --> 22:24.127
But, Henry, you're right.

22:24.159 --> 22:26.292
If I stay here, Fiona's
just gonna lock me up again.

22:26.328 --> 22:27.893
And that's not good for me or you.

22:27.929 --> 22:29.862
Y-You can't leave.

22:29.897 --> 22:31.351
It's not for forever.

22:31.376 --> 22:33.609
I'll come back, I promise.

22:33.768 --> 22:38.004
I just need to get out of here
for a while and... lay low.

22:41.408 --> 22:44.143
Okay. Fine.

22:44.178 --> 22:45.377
But you got to wait.

22:45.412 --> 22:46.911
You'll be safer if you leave after dark.

22:46.947 --> 22:48.789
I know where Dr. Hopper
keeps your car keys.

22:48.814 --> 22:50.582
- I can get them for you.
- Seriously?

22:50.618 --> 22:51.915
A few seconds ago, you
were trying to keep me here.

22:51.940 --> 22:53.673
Now you're gonna help me leave?

22:54.142 --> 22:55.920
You're my mom.

22:55.956 --> 22:58.422
I'll always want to help you.

22:58.458 --> 23:00.391
And you're right.

23:00.426 --> 23:02.483
You don't deserve to be locked up again.

23:02.709 --> 23:04.443
Thanks, kid.

23:04.913 --> 23:08.194
Meet me back in an hour, and after that,

23:08.219 --> 23:10.752
I promise you'll have the
life you always wanted.

23:30.677 --> 23:32.609
"To my son, Gideon.

23:32.645 --> 23:35.708
Remember to be strong and true.

23:35.733 --> 23:37.533
I will always love you.

23:37.558 --> 23:38.690
Mother."

23:46.377 --> 23:47.681
Gideon...

23:48.471 --> 23:49.803
I know it's not easy

23:49.839 --> 23:51.455
to talk about Belle.

23:52.475 --> 23:54.343
But this book...

23:54.891 --> 23:56.812
meant the world to her,

23:57.326 --> 23:59.359
and she really wanted you to have it.

23:59.395 --> 24:00.360
I know.

24:00.396 --> 24:03.197
So I would always remember
how much she loved me.

24:03.332 --> 24:04.765
Yeah.

24:06.420 --> 24:08.950
Yeah, well... Fiona's
been more of a mother to me

24:08.975 --> 24:10.141
than she ever was.

24:12.560 --> 24:14.427
How much do you remember?

24:15.650 --> 24:17.550
A-About when she left?

24:20.897 --> 24:24.332
Only what you told
me. I was just a baby.

24:24.375 --> 24:27.176
She said she was going to the
store, and she never came back.

24:32.001 --> 24:33.367
Yeah, well, you know,
I-I-I've been thinking,

24:33.402 --> 24:35.870
and, um...

24:35.905 --> 24:37.938
well, maybe we don't
know the whole story.

24:39.742 --> 24:41.607
Your mother wouldn't just leave...

24:43.359 --> 24:44.410
not without good reason.

24:44.446 --> 24:45.864
Will you stop with this?

24:45.903 --> 24:47.058
She walked out on us.

24:47.083 --> 24:48.879
Don't try to rationalize it away.

24:49.077 --> 24:50.276
She didn't love us.

24:50.301 --> 24:51.317
No.

24:51.342 --> 24:53.509
No, I-I-I can't accept that.

24:53.544 --> 24:54.606
She would never do that.

24:54.631 --> 24:56.197
But she did.

24:56.989 --> 24:58.313
And you know what?

24:58.348 --> 25:00.815
We don't need her to have a happy life.

25:00.850 --> 25:04.118
We have everything we need
right here in this shop.

25:04.364 --> 25:05.552
You just...

25:06.388 --> 25:08.088
you refuse to see it.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.666
Your mother loved you, Gideon.

25:13.424 --> 25:15.791
And no matter what may
have happened between us...

25:16.651 --> 25:18.918
she would always want to
be a part of your life.

25:21.183 --> 25:22.415
Please, just...

25:24.534 --> 25:25.734
leave it alone.

25:27.037 --> 25:28.666
Gideon.

25:39.145 --> 25:40.848
Lizard horn?

25:41.347 --> 25:42.892
Nope. All gone.

25:42.917 --> 25:44.783
How is that possible?

25:44.849 --> 25:46.316
I had tons of it.

25:48.426 --> 25:50.287
It's all gone.

25:50.847 --> 25:53.489
All my things are gone!

25:53.525 --> 25:55.926
Somebody's stolen from me!

25:56.347 --> 25:57.627
Well, it can't be any of the new people.

25:57.662 --> 26:00.063
- They just got here.
- Well, then, who is it?

26:00.964 --> 26:02.096
Oh, goody.

26:02.132 --> 26:03.497
I think we're about to find out.

26:03.532 --> 26:06.234
I am so going to enjoy this.

26:06.891 --> 26:10.258
Who the hell is in my house?!

26:10.373 --> 26:11.738
Regina?

26:13.207 --> 26:14.355
You're back.

26:14.380 --> 26:15.612
I-I'm back?

26:15.771 --> 26:17.270
You're back.

26:17.305 --> 26:19.037
Well, this is disappointing.

26:21.008 --> 26:22.403
So, you're the one

26:22.428 --> 26:24.559
who's been squatting in my castle?

26:24.584 --> 26:26.592
I'm not "squatting" anywhere.

26:26.617 --> 26:30.537
This is the Evil Queen's
castle, after all.

26:31.932 --> 26:34.037
Nice outfit, by the way.

26:34.321 --> 26:36.265
We really do make it
look good, don't we?

26:36.290 --> 26:37.256
Thanks.

26:38.124 --> 26:40.988
I-I mean w-what are you doing here?

26:41.023 --> 26:43.190
I thought you were in
that Wish Realm with Robin.

26:43.225 --> 26:44.658
Well, I was.

26:44.693 --> 26:47.361
But there was one little
thing you neglected to mention

26:47.396 --> 26:50.431
before sending me off
to my fabulous new home.

26:50.466 --> 26:54.267
Everyone there thinks I
murdered Snow and Charming.

26:54.302 --> 26:56.958
And my own son was trying to kill me.

26:56.983 --> 26:59.278
So, after three days of angry villagers

26:59.303 --> 27:01.069
trying to burn my home,

27:01.342 --> 27:03.381
I decided to find a new place to live.

27:03.406 --> 27:05.592
What about Robin? Hmm?

27:06.366 --> 27:07.535
Did you murder him, too?

27:07.560 --> 27:09.066
Of course not.

27:09.390 --> 27:10.856
He's out with Friar Tuck.

27:10.881 --> 27:14.271
And I don't murder anymore, Zelena.

27:14.306 --> 27:17.374
Robin and I have turned over a new leaf.

27:17.410 --> 27:20.877
We now steal from the
rich and give to the poor.

27:20.913 --> 27:22.612
Well, mostly anyway.

27:22.648 --> 27:23.580
Sounds delightful.

27:23.615 --> 27:25.415
Look, can we get back
to saving the world now?

27:25.450 --> 27:26.873
You know, while there's
still one to save.

27:26.920 --> 27:28.353
Yes, um...

27:28.388 --> 27:32.092
w-we're having a bit
of a... fairy problem.

27:32.117 --> 27:33.764
Oh.

27:34.427 --> 27:35.670
Do tell.

27:43.251 --> 27:44.587
Yes?

27:46.376 --> 27:48.405
She did what?

28:19.886 --> 28:20.952
Henry.

28:22.623 --> 28:24.123
Oh.

28:24.158 --> 28:24.956
Hey, Mom.

28:26.560 --> 28:30.043
There's no reason to pretend, Henry.

28:30.068 --> 28:32.403
We both know I'm not your mother.

28:33.349 --> 28:36.153
So, you know I'm awake.

28:36.178 --> 28:38.145
I know everything.

28:40.489 --> 28:41.876
What are you gonna do?

28:42.807 --> 28:44.440
Put me in the crazy house, too?

28:44.860 --> 28:46.560
Of course not.

28:46.595 --> 28:49.729
You're much more useful to me out here.

28:49.765 --> 28:52.265
What's that mean... "useful"?

28:52.300 --> 28:55.151
Turns out, getting a
Savior to give up her belief

28:55.176 --> 28:56.976
is much harder than I thought.

28:57.205 --> 28:59.886
Even if you take everything
away from her, which I have,

28:59.911 --> 29:03.519
there's still that one
last pesky speck of belief

29:03.559 --> 29:05.392
that just refuses to die out.

29:05.427 --> 29:06.760
And it never will.

29:07.185 --> 29:08.961
- Henry...
- Stay away from me.

29:08.997 --> 29:10.530
- Come back.
- No.

29:11.318 --> 29:12.432
My mom's strong.

29:12.819 --> 29:13.785
She'll fight it,

29:13.810 --> 29:15.435
and there's nothing
you can do to stop that.

29:15.470 --> 29:16.870
You're right.

29:16.905 --> 29:19.639
There is nothing I can do to stop it.

29:19.674 --> 29:21.807
But there is something you can do.

29:39.839 --> 29:41.823
Madame Mayor, what happened?

29:42.019 --> 29:43.518
There was an accident.

29:43.553 --> 29:45.320
Henry broke into his doctor's office,

29:45.355 --> 29:47.355
had a nasty fall down the stairs.

29:47.391 --> 29:48.713
Oh, I'm so sorry.

29:48.760 --> 29:49.859
I just don't know how this could be.

29:49.894 --> 29:52.527
They say that he's stable,
but it was such a tumble.

29:52.563 --> 29:55.650
He has to be all right. He has to be.

29:55.675 --> 29:58.619
He'll pull through.
The boy is resilient.

29:58.969 --> 29:59.934
Thank you.

30:02.176 --> 30:05.010
But that's not the only
reason for your visit,

30:05.046 --> 30:05.966
is it?

30:05.982 --> 30:07.448
I know this is poor timing,

30:07.484 --> 30:09.552
but there's something I
need to discuss with you.

30:09.802 --> 30:12.652
Yes, the timing is poor.

30:12.687 --> 30:14.454
Perhaps we can chat about it later

30:14.490 --> 30:15.727
over my infamous black pudding.

30:15.752 --> 30:17.315
Gideon, too, of course.

30:17.340 --> 30:19.159
I need you to reopen the investigation

30:19.184 --> 30:21.566
into Belle's disappearance.

30:22.386 --> 30:23.684
Oh.

30:25.997 --> 30:29.998
You and Gideon lead such charmed lives.

30:30.034 --> 30:31.867
Why tear open old wounds?

30:31.902 --> 30:33.802
Well, they never properly healed.

30:35.442 --> 30:37.074
Gideon may hide it well enough,

30:37.110 --> 30:39.878
but I know he's... he's hurting inside.

30:39.913 --> 30:42.079
He needs to know the truth.

30:42.115 --> 30:44.381
Belle wouldn't just
abandon him for no reason.

30:49.273 --> 30:50.907
Come with me.

31:03.059 --> 31:05.059
Well, it appears we have
some ground to cover.

31:05.094 --> 31:06.879
Well, it's got to be in here somewhere.

31:10.724 --> 31:11.990
Maybe it's up there.

31:15.606 --> 31:17.539
Well, that shouldn't be too difficult.

31:17.574 --> 31:19.089
Apart from the fact
that that's way up there,

31:19.114 --> 31:20.089
and we're way down here.

31:20.114 --> 31:21.609
Come on. You just climbed a beanstalk.

31:21.645 --> 31:22.977
What's some oversized furniture?

31:23.012 --> 31:24.979
It's not the furniture
I'm worried about.

31:25.014 --> 31:26.707
It's its oversized owners.

31:26.732 --> 31:27.885
I thought the giants were gone.

31:27.910 --> 31:29.918
It appears some have stayed.

31:30.039 --> 31:31.630
- Let's not dawdle.
- Yeah.

31:40.108 --> 31:41.593
Oh, what are we doing?

31:41.618 --> 31:42.712
You can't pull yourself up there.

31:42.737 --> 31:45.137
- You only have one hand.
- I'm a pirate.

31:45.510 --> 31:47.447
You don't think I've
swung from masts before?

31:47.472 --> 31:49.138
I'm doing this.

31:49.280 --> 31:51.513
She's your daughter, but she's my wife.

31:51.548 --> 31:53.815
No arguments. It has to be me.

31:53.850 --> 31:55.650
Okay, you're right.

31:56.558 --> 31:57.511
I am?

31:57.536 --> 31:58.568
Yeah.

31:58.629 --> 32:01.429
So, you're gonna trust all
of our fates to a pirate?

32:01.465 --> 32:02.631
No.

32:02.666 --> 32:04.316
I'm gonna trust my son...

32:05.136 --> 32:07.101
in-law.

32:07.137 --> 32:08.803
Thank you.

32:25.511 --> 32:27.160
Is everything all right up there?

32:27.185 --> 32:29.527
This place is a bloody obstacle course.

32:39.274 --> 32:41.240
Hmm. Merlot.

32:46.374 --> 32:48.315
- You need help?
- No, I'm fine.

32:48.340 --> 32:50.640
I think I just might
have found something.

33:06.611 --> 33:07.710
What was that?

33:10.756 --> 33:13.155
Just, uh

33:13.191 --> 33:15.288
retrieving the

33:15.568 --> 33:16.868
the bean!

33:39.095 --> 33:40.528
Bloody hell.

33:40.553 --> 33:42.352
I think I just woke up the giants!

33:49.943 --> 33:51.782
Hook, I think it's worse than giants.

33:52.704 --> 33:54.478
Don't tell me you're
afraid of a little fire.

33:54.514 --> 33:55.680
That's not fire.

33:55.716 --> 33:57.015
Lovely. Run!

34:13.440 --> 34:14.507
So, yes.

34:14.542 --> 34:17.097
I haven't been completely honest.

34:19.175 --> 34:22.443
The police did find evidence
of what happened to Belle.

34:23.775 --> 34:27.542
I just wanted to save you
and Gideon the heartbreak.

34:48.465 --> 34:49.668
Well...

34:51.096 --> 34:52.716
she wanted to see the world.

34:53.510 --> 34:56.172
Just not with you, it would appear.

34:58.159 --> 35:01.407
Look, I must be frank with you,

35:01.432 --> 35:03.837
for your sake as well as Gideon's.

35:03.862 --> 35:07.363
You're the one that caused
him all this pain, not Belle.

35:07.649 --> 35:09.775
She left because you
could never be the man

35:09.800 --> 35:11.603
she wanted you to be.

35:11.650 --> 35:15.551
But you can still be the man
your son needs you to be...

35:16.234 --> 35:18.070
by accepting that

35:18.556 --> 35:20.655
and moving on.

35:26.180 --> 35:28.080
Thank you.

35:29.959 --> 35:31.942
This was, uh...

35:32.451 --> 35:33.739
illuminating.

35:56.398 --> 35:58.317
Oh, Henry.

35:58.511 --> 36:00.143
What do you know?

36:06.537 --> 36:08.179
Henry!

36:08.204 --> 36:10.195
What happened? Are you okay?

36:10.720 --> 36:11.976
Mom?

36:13.374 --> 36:15.643
He was trying to steal this.

36:17.015 --> 36:20.550
Then he tried to escape
and had a nasty fall.

36:20.818 --> 36:21.693
You lied to me.

36:21.718 --> 36:22.984
You said you were done with all this.

36:23.140 --> 36:25.839
No. She's the one that's lying.

36:25.874 --> 36:27.296
I didn't fall. She pushed me.

36:27.321 --> 36:29.088
She wants to destroy your belief.

36:29.374 --> 36:31.340
He's confused...

36:31.376 --> 36:33.754
Concussed, according to Dr. Whale.

36:33.779 --> 36:36.179
Look, I pulled this
from the security camera.

36:37.292 --> 36:39.824
Put aside the fact
that he's my own son...

36:40.067 --> 36:42.467
How could I push him if I
wasn't even touching him?

36:42.502 --> 36:43.868
She used magic.

36:43.903 --> 36:46.638
Kid, there's no such thing as magic.

36:46.673 --> 36:50.275
True belief is believing
even if you can't see.

36:50.310 --> 36:51.676
Here, just look at the book.

36:51.712 --> 36:52.542
Henry.

36:52.567 --> 36:54.067
- Just touch it.
- Henry, enough.

36:54.092 --> 36:55.231
- Touch it!
- Okay, fine.

36:55.256 --> 36:58.223
All right, Henry. I'm...
I'm touching the book.

37:04.067 --> 37:05.341
It... it didn't work.

37:05.654 --> 37:09.286
I'm sorry, but you're not a kid anymore.

37:09.691 --> 37:12.669
This isn't some daring rescue operation.

37:12.694 --> 37:14.294
It's real life.

37:14.344 --> 37:16.477
Mom... please.

37:16.998 --> 37:19.239
It was just his arm this time.

37:19.264 --> 37:21.426
Next time, what if it's his neck...

37:21.458 --> 37:22.390
or worse?

37:22.426 --> 37:24.684
This is the apple
turnover all over again.

37:24.700 --> 37:25.799
He's hurting himself

37:25.834 --> 37:28.134
to make you believe his delusions.

37:28.567 --> 37:31.837
This is all my fault. It has to stop.

37:32.036 --> 37:35.204
Then you know what you have to do.

37:36.468 --> 37:38.764
No. Mom, you can't destroy it.

37:38.913 --> 37:42.505
You just... have to believe in me.

37:42.541 --> 37:45.442
Kid, just 'cause you believe
something doesn't make it true.

37:45.477 --> 37:47.444
That's exactly what makes it true.

37:48.520 --> 37:50.086
Deep down, you know that.

37:50.121 --> 37:51.988
What I know, Henry,

37:52.293 --> 37:54.491
is that I love you.

37:55.043 --> 37:57.994
And that's why I have to do this.

37:58.029 --> 37:59.262
Mom.

37:59.297 --> 38:01.631
No. Don't go.

38:01.666 --> 38:03.457
This is it. This is the Final Battle.

38:03.482 --> 38:05.058
Henry, I'm sorry.

38:06.871 --> 38:09.137
Mom!

38:43.574 --> 38:46.113
What was that?! Was it the dragon?!

38:46.138 --> 38:47.906
I don't think so.

38:48.241 --> 38:50.843
I think we got a bigger
problem than a dragon!

39:09.220 --> 39:11.186
Go on, dear.

39:12.080 --> 39:15.415
Only you can save our son now, Emma.

39:20.712 --> 39:22.595
Go on.

40:00.141 --> 40:02.074
I think we may be too late.

40:03.810 --> 40:05.510
We better get a move on! Go!

40:58.306 --> 41:00.032
Your father wouldn't want you in tears.

41:00.057 --> 41:01.563
Not on his behalf.

41:02.235 --> 41:03.969
Tiger Lily.

41:04.844 --> 41:06.412
What happened here?

41:06.447 --> 41:08.012
Where is Father?

41:08.048 --> 41:09.314
I don't know.

41:10.883 --> 41:12.716
But I do know that it's clear

41:12.752 --> 41:15.006
he fought valiantly so you could escape.

41:15.031 --> 41:16.584
I never should've left.

41:16.609 --> 41:18.045
I should've fought with him!

41:18.070 --> 41:21.404
No. You were right to
follow his instructions.

41:21.556 --> 41:23.111
Because you did,

41:23.136 --> 41:24.902
the book is safe.

41:25.029 --> 41:26.986
We need to take it to your mother now.

41:27.011 --> 41:28.308
She'll be waiting.

41:29.645 --> 41:31.439
But what about Father?

41:32.072 --> 41:33.829
You'll be reunited one day.

41:33.854 --> 41:36.288
I promise. The Fairies have foreseen it.

41:37.111 --> 41:38.453
They have?

41:38.478 --> 41:40.603
W-We're going to be okay?

41:45.243 --> 41:47.443
The future is cloudy,

41:47.468 --> 41:49.801
but you will be reunited.

41:50.715 --> 41:52.657
After that...

41:57.403 --> 41:58.857
you just need to learn the lesson

41:58.882 --> 42:00.502
imparted by this book.

42:02.601 --> 42:04.482
Never lose hope.

42:15.305 --> 42:17.564
It... it can't be.

42:17.635 --> 42:20.869
Well, I'm afraid it is. Your Story Book.

42:21.096 --> 42:22.804
Or what's left of it.

42:22.840 --> 42:25.707
No way. My mom would never burn it.

42:25.743 --> 42:27.243
Oh, but she did.

42:27.623 --> 42:30.979
Whatever last bit of belief
she clung to went up in smoke,

42:31.015 --> 42:34.616
just like the pages
of your precious book.

42:35.600 --> 42:37.967
Not even you could destroy
her belief completely.

42:38.002 --> 42:40.469
If that's so, then why
is she packing for Boston

42:40.504 --> 42:42.138
at this very moment?

42:44.008 --> 42:45.174
I'll stop you.

42:45.210 --> 42:46.654
Oh, haven't you already tried that?

42:46.679 --> 42:47.876
Look where it got you.

42:47.911 --> 42:49.311
It's not just me.

42:49.475 --> 42:51.246
It's my family.

42:51.281 --> 42:52.684
We won't let you win.

42:52.709 --> 42:55.081
Oh, haven't I mentioned the consequences

42:55.106 --> 42:56.517
of Emma's lost belief?

42:58.416 --> 43:00.145
Your family isn't going to exist

43:00.170 --> 43:02.567
long enough to save themselves,

43:03.154 --> 43:05.554
let alone your mother.

43:23.416 --> 43:25.037
Hurry, mate!

43:25.062 --> 43:26.729
Yeah, I know!

43:28.223 --> 43:29.188
Aah!

43:29.215 --> 43:30.535
Hook!

43:30.560 --> 43:32.121
Aah!

43:40.581 --> 43:42.785
Hoooook!

43:49.618 --> 43:51.385
Aah!

43:53.900 --> 43:55.259
Charming.

43:55.284 --> 43:56.666
Something's wrong.

43:56.701 --> 43:59.336
Where? I'll get us there.

43:59.542 --> 44:01.275
I don't know.

44:03.042 --> 44:04.874
Then let's go find him.

44:09.380 --> 44:10.780
David!

44:10.815 --> 44:11.813
David?!

44:12.883 --> 44:13.782
David!

44:13.817 --> 44:15.702
David!

44:19.866 --> 44:21.435
Hello there, mummy.

44:21.460 --> 44:22.391
"Mummy?"

44:22.427 --> 44:24.343
Oh, there was a... There was a wedding.

44:24.368 --> 44:27.796
And yeah, that is still going
to take some getting used to.

44:29.625 --> 44:31.625
Uh, what happened?

44:31.935 --> 44:33.382
Well, first, I fell,

44:33.407 --> 44:35.225
and then... and then it fell,

44:35.250 --> 44:38.257
but we managed to get this.

44:38.655 --> 44:39.955
Great!

44:40.796 --> 44:42.643
Where's David?

44:44.631 --> 44:46.463
You mean he's not here?

44:48.615 --> 44:49.647
David?!

44:49.683 --> 44:51.116
- He was on that?
- David?!

44:51.151 --> 44:52.396
We should start searching.

44:52.421 --> 44:54.255
- This beanstalk goes on for miles.
- No, you're getting back to the castle.

44:54.271 --> 44:55.604
Take the bean. Get to Emma and Henry.

44:55.639 --> 44:57.433
Don't worry about David. I'll find him.

44:57.458 --> 44:58.873
The realms are disappearing.

44:58.909 --> 45:00.141
We don't have much time.

45:00.538 --> 45:01.903
Get to Emma.

45:01.928 --> 45:03.294
It's important.

45:03.603 --> 45:05.692
Make her believe again.

45:08.951 --> 45:10.751
So it's true.

45:10.776 --> 45:12.246
You're really leaving Storybrooke.

45:12.271 --> 45:14.138
It's what's best for both of us, kid.

45:17.092 --> 45:18.958
Don't you get it?

45:18.993 --> 45:20.408
This is what she wants.

45:20.433 --> 45:21.294
The Black Fairy cast the curse

45:21.330 --> 45:22.861
so all this would get you to leave.

45:22.886 --> 45:24.219
This is why I have to go,

45:24.244 --> 45:26.236
because you still believe
this nonsense is true.

45:26.261 --> 45:27.893
- It is.
- Henry, stop.

45:29.439 --> 45:32.339
Don't get me wrong. I
am so happy you found me.

45:32.374 --> 45:35.010
And I'm so happy I got to know my son.

45:35.035 --> 45:36.634
But it's so clear now.

45:37.010 --> 45:40.011
Coming to Storybrooke
wasn't good for either of us.

45:40.047 --> 45:41.283
You're wrong.

45:41.308 --> 45:42.740
Look where I ended up.

45:42.921 --> 45:44.455
Look at you. Look at your arm.

45:45.401 --> 45:47.442
It sent us on a dangerous path.

45:47.551 --> 45:50.101
I got to get back to
Boston and back to my life.

45:50.126 --> 45:52.059
And so do you.

45:52.992 --> 45:54.113
She did it.

45:56.630 --> 45:57.709
You really don't believe?

45:57.745 --> 46:00.046
There's nothing to believe.

46:02.908 --> 46:04.650
Goodbye, kid.

46:07.612 --> 46:09.104
I love you.

46:29.626 --> 46:31.861
_

47:07.866 --> 47:09.819
You might not think this story's true.

47:09.851 --> 47:11.418
But I know that it is.

47:11.453 --> 47:13.725
And it can still have a happy ending.

47:18.560 --> 47:19.392
Hello?

47:19.427 --> 47:21.179
Hey, Swan, I got your message.

47:21.235 --> 47:23.102
- You back?
- Yeah, I'm back.

47:23.137 --> 47:24.937
Great. Ready to go to work?

47:25.089 --> 47:26.989
'Cause I got a guy who jumped bail...

47:27.195 --> 47:29.775
a perfect mark for
your "first date" trick.

47:30.084 --> 47:31.483
What do you say?

47:31.508 --> 47:32.945
Sounds good.

47:45.371 --> 47:47.668
_

47:49.184 --> 47:51.738
_

48:03.330 --> 48:05.897
And you left Snow behind?

48:05.933 --> 48:08.133
But I have the bean. And
that's the priority...

48:08.168 --> 48:09.885
getting back home to Emma, to Henry.

48:09.910 --> 48:11.785
She'll find David. She always does.

48:14.143 --> 48:16.140
Well, we have a problem.

48:16.175 --> 48:17.814
What the devil happened to it?

48:17.893 --> 48:20.055
Emma. Her lack of belief.

48:20.080 --> 48:21.928
It's sapping the magic
from everything here.

48:21.963 --> 48:23.806
Well, can't you fix it? Make it work?

48:23.831 --> 48:27.097
Well, I can't. I'm... I
don't... have enough power.

48:28.436 --> 48:30.035
Of course you do, sis.

48:30.306 --> 48:34.873
With a little help from, well, yourself.

48:34.909 --> 48:36.513
The Evil Queen.

48:36.748 --> 48:38.215
Your evil half is here?

48:38.250 --> 48:40.482
Well, she's not evil. Not completely.

48:40.498 --> 48:41.298
And yes, she's here.

48:41.333 --> 48:42.397
And you trust here?

48:42.433 --> 48:44.399
Well, of course I do. She's me.

48:44.435 --> 48:46.468
And remember, Henry's her son, too.

48:55.043 --> 48:56.979
David!

49:02.146 --> 49:03.707
David!

49:09.448 --> 49:10.914
No, no, no!

49:10.950 --> 49:11.882
No, no!

49:11.917 --> 49:14.084
Please, no! Please, no!

49:21.026 --> 49:22.769
Please, no!

49:22.794 --> 49:24.003
No.

49:57.389 --> 49:59.622
You found me.

49:59.657 --> 50:01.787
Did you ever doubt I would?

50:02.209 --> 50:05.540
Truthfully, the beanstalk
that fell on me gave me pause.

50:08.913 --> 50:10.280
Snow, we're gonna be fine.

50:10.315 --> 50:11.781
Darkness never wins.

50:12.206 --> 50:14.782
It just fools you into thinking it does.

50:16.701 --> 50:18.600
I love you, Charming.

50:20.726 --> 50:22.625
I love you, Snow.

50:28.320 --> 50:29.486
Let's go.

50:33.564 --> 50:35.303
Mr. Gold?

50:36.717 --> 50:39.495
And where do you think
you're going to, young man?

50:39.530 --> 50:41.162
That room is off limits to customers.

50:41.187 --> 50:43.154
I'm not a customer.

50:43.377 --> 50:44.542
I'm your grandson.

50:45.084 --> 50:46.368
Is that so?

50:46.404 --> 50:47.096
Yep.

50:47.121 --> 50:48.932
You must've hit your head pretty badly.

50:48.957 --> 50:52.092
Now, if you don't mind, I
got work to do, so... please.

51:05.673 --> 51:06.982
You're awake.

51:07.018 --> 51:09.451
I know what magic looks like.

51:09.486 --> 51:11.620
What are you up to, Grandpa?

51:13.367 --> 51:16.912
Clever under any circumstances,
aren't you, my boy?

51:16.991 --> 51:18.758
Why have you been pretending?

51:18.794 --> 51:19.959
Because, believe it or not,

51:19.984 --> 51:23.560
I didn't entirely trust my
mother when she cast the curse.

51:23.585 --> 51:25.771
And, as usual, I was right not to.

51:27.001 --> 51:28.436
Our agreement wasn't to put me

51:28.461 --> 51:31.497
in this pathetic circumstance
here without Belle.

51:33.109 --> 51:34.850
She betrayed me.

51:34.875 --> 51:36.241
Again.

51:36.276 --> 51:37.680
What are you planning?

51:37.705 --> 51:40.239
To find out her true intentions.

51:40.548 --> 51:43.277
She told me Belle was
off to see the world,

51:43.675 --> 51:44.980
but I know better.

51:45.301 --> 51:48.473
She'd keep her here for
leverage, just in case.

51:48.498 --> 51:50.822
Well, Belle's gonna have to wait.

51:50.857 --> 51:53.122
Everyone back in the
Enchanted Forest is in danger

51:53.161 --> 51:55.661
because the Black Fairy
made Emma stop believing.

51:55.876 --> 51:57.698
You got to help me save my family.

51:57.723 --> 51:59.323
Our family.

51:59.451 --> 52:00.883
And then we can find Belle.

52:01.114 --> 52:03.302
I'm sorry, Henry, you're on your own.

52:03.337 --> 52:06.171
All I care about right now is Belle.

52:07.308 --> 52:08.440
Fine.

52:08.475 --> 52:10.242
But if you're not gonna help,

52:10.277 --> 52:12.510
at least let me take
something that can help me.

52:12.546 --> 52:15.413
And what exactly did you have in mind?

52:15.964 --> 52:17.441
Actually...

52:18.118 --> 52:19.517
there's two things.

52:28.032 --> 52:31.218
So, uh, I'm not sure if
any of you on the other side

52:31.241 --> 52:34.653
are listening, but
if you are, I'm sorry.

52:34.678 --> 52:36.827
I tried my best to keep
Emma from losing belief,

52:36.852 --> 52:38.813
but it wasn't good enough.

52:45.290 --> 52:48.224
But that doesn't mean I'm
going down without a fight.

52:55.936 --> 52:58.662
If Emma's not around to
take on the Black Fairy,

52:59.317 --> 53:01.027
then I will.

53:02.737 --> 53:04.121
He's going alone.

53:04.299 --> 53:06.449
But how could he win
against her if Emma couldn't?

53:06.479 --> 53:07.778
He's a tough boy.

53:08.629 --> 53:10.642
Get that bean working now.

53:11.256 --> 53:12.380
I'm sorry, Regina,

53:12.405 --> 53:13.842
but even with our magic combined,

53:13.866 --> 53:15.231
it will still take time.

53:16.147 --> 53:17.231
We don't have time.

53:17.256 --> 53:19.163
It's on the outskirts of
the forest and moving fast.

53:19.188 --> 53:20.653
The magic's almost here.

53:20.678 --> 53:21.842
"Almost."

53:22.663 --> 53:24.897
I'm afraid that's a bit
of an understatement.

53:25.275 --> 53:26.241
It is here.

53:26.695 --> 53:28.816
Let's round everyone
up, get them to safety.

53:41.458 --> 53:43.548
What the hell are you doing?

53:44.458 --> 53:46.419
I'm going to hold it
off as long as I can.

53:46.444 --> 53:47.844
You'll die!

53:47.869 --> 53:50.302
It'll give you a chance
to get to the courtyard.

53:50.464 --> 53:52.429
Go to the center of the castle.

53:52.590 --> 53:55.426
You can survive long enough
there to get the bean to work.

53:55.451 --> 53:57.118
You just need time.

53:57.143 --> 53:58.943
Let me give that to you.

53:59.473 --> 54:00.706
Regina.

54:04.127 --> 54:05.693
Go.

54:05.729 --> 54:07.455
He's my son, too.

54:09.079 --> 54:11.380
He needs at least one of us.

54:37.342 --> 54:39.468
Everyone, to the center, quickly!

54:39.493 --> 54:41.491
Close together!

55:55.671 --> 55:57.271
Not so fast.

55:58.774 --> 56:00.208
You came back.

56:00.243 --> 56:01.749
Yeah. I did, kid.

56:01.796 --> 56:03.826
Does that mean you... you remember?

56:03.851 --> 56:06.150
I... found the book you left.

56:06.185 --> 56:08.419
I was about to take another job and...

56:08.594 --> 56:10.255
and then I thought about
this woman you wrote about

56:10.280 --> 56:12.231
who was a hero with a family

56:12.258 --> 56:14.528
and a Savior who never
ran from a battle and...

56:14.553 --> 56:15.727
You.

56:15.762 --> 56:19.162
Well, I'm not sure that
it's me, Henry, but, um...

56:20.686 --> 56:22.900
but it's who I want to be.

56:25.142 --> 56:28.275
So I don't remember all
the crazy stuff you told me,

56:28.300 --> 56:29.501
but...

56:31.376 --> 56:33.048
I believe it.

56:49.282 --> 56:50.882
What happened?

56:55.568 --> 56:57.868
Emma. She's back!

57:27.210 --> 57:28.709
Belle?

57:39.770 --> 57:41.203
Belle?

57:41.238 --> 57:43.772
I don't want to leave!
I don't want to leave!

57:43.808 --> 57:45.207
Please!

57:48.411 --> 57:49.443
Belle.

57:49.479 --> 57:51.678
How do you know my name?

57:51.713 --> 57:54.398
I can explain if you give me a chance.

57:54.423 --> 57:56.577
Just leave me alone,
okay? I'm safe here.

57:56.602 --> 57:59.312
Belle, I know this is
difficult to understand...

58:00.037 --> 58:01.398
but...

58:02.883 --> 58:04.666
you're not like this.

58:04.822 --> 58:06.689
The Black Fairy did this to you.

58:06.724 --> 58:08.337
Changed you.

58:10.361 --> 58:12.197
I promise you,

58:12.763 --> 58:14.541
the woman who did this,

58:15.908 --> 58:18.776
I am gonna make her pay.

58:25.542 --> 58:26.707
Madame Mayor, what's wrong?

58:26.743 --> 58:28.208
Are you here to pick up your watch?

58:28.244 --> 58:30.344
No, I'm not here for my watch.

58:30.379 --> 58:33.180
I'm here because Emma Swan is back.

58:33.942 --> 58:36.911
Uh, sorry. I don't understand.

58:37.185 --> 58:38.252
Are you all right?

58:38.287 --> 58:39.921
Do you need something?

58:40.106 --> 58:42.021
Indeed I do.

58:42.057 --> 58:44.591
There's a Fairy wand in this shop.

58:44.626 --> 58:46.025
My Fairy wand.

58:46.255 --> 58:48.349
And I need it back now.

58:48.374 --> 58:50.685
A Fairy wand?

58:52.501 --> 58:54.014
Perhaps I should call my father.

58:54.039 --> 58:55.939
He'll know what to do.

58:57.421 --> 58:59.121
Drop it! Now.

59:00.490 --> 59:03.169
The last thing I need
is Gold getting involved.

59:04.403 --> 59:06.250
Why did I do that?

59:06.771 --> 59:08.277
I didn't want to do that.

59:08.302 --> 59:11.661
Despite what your father
thinks, I still have your heart.

59:11.693 --> 59:13.925
You have to do whatever I say.

59:13.961 --> 59:16.361
So start looking for that wand now.

59:20.503 --> 59:21.519
What is that?

59:21.544 --> 59:23.612
The runes that Henry scribbled.

59:23.637 --> 59:26.677
It's an ancient language
long lost to time.

59:26.868 --> 59:29.051
I need the wand to translate it.

59:29.716 --> 59:33.082
It holds the key to
winning the Final Battle.

59:33.257 --> 59:34.325
Is...

59:35.473 --> 59:38.407
this what you were looking for?

59:41.324 --> 59:43.626
Yes.

59:43.943 --> 59:46.443
Yes, it is.

59:46.811 --> 59:49.946
It's been centuries
since I felt its power.

01:00:04.336 --> 01:00:06.203
Wonderful.

01:00:07.906 --> 01:00:10.173
Time to go to work, Gideon.

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.073
Ah.

01:00:35.776 --> 01:00:38.076
Hello, Mr. Gold.

01:00:38.112 --> 01:00:40.979
I was just here to pick up my watch.

01:00:43.915 --> 01:00:45.915
No, you weren't...

01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:47.516
Mother.

01:00:51.165 --> 01:00:52.829
Of course.

01:00:53.991 --> 01:00:56.546
You know, I only
separated you from Belle

01:00:56.571 --> 01:00:58.047
for your own good.

01:00:58.788 --> 01:01:00.108
She's my wife.

01:01:00.132 --> 01:01:01.241
And a terrible one.

01:01:01.276 --> 01:01:04.244
She would convince you to go
against your dark instincts.

01:01:04.342 --> 01:01:06.509
I couldn't let that happen.

01:01:06.764 --> 01:01:08.916
But once the Final Battle is won,

01:01:08.941 --> 01:01:11.378
the curse on Belle and
Gideon will be lifted,

01:01:11.495 --> 01:01:15.063
and I will have unchecked powers.

01:01:15.098 --> 01:01:18.066
Not even the laws of magic will apply.

01:01:19.104 --> 01:01:20.857
I can make them love you

01:01:20.882 --> 01:01:23.703
without you having to
give up being the Dark One.

01:01:24.733 --> 01:01:26.500
Don't you realize?

01:01:26.871 --> 01:01:28.983
You can finally have it all.

01:01:30.346 --> 01:01:31.813
No...

01:01:31.848 --> 01:01:33.515
I can't.

01:01:34.356 --> 01:01:36.223
I won't trust you.

01:01:37.849 --> 01:01:39.215
All you care about's yourself.

01:01:39.250 --> 01:01:41.884
I care about you! Always have!

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:44.720
And I worked tirelessly to reunite us!

01:01:44.755 --> 01:01:48.012
And now we can be a family again.

01:01:49.512 --> 01:01:52.372
And not just with Belle and Gideon.

01:01:54.103 --> 01:01:55.769
What do you mean by that?

01:01:57.142 --> 01:02:01.837
With my new powers, I
can bring back the dead.

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:05.280
Like Baelfire.

01:02:06.447 --> 01:02:09.284
Your first son that you lost.

01:02:10.119 --> 01:02:13.288
All your desires can be had.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:21.524
Your magic will really
allow us to have it all?

01:02:27.369 --> 01:02:29.835
Without a doubt.

01:02:41.848 --> 01:02:44.049
Well, there's just one problem.

01:02:46.787 --> 01:02:49.555
All magic comes with a price.

01:02:54.657 --> 01:02:57.391
And I'm no longer willing to pay it.

01:02:58.627 --> 01:03:01.695
You will not be winning any battle.

01:03:01.730 --> 01:03:04.197
And you are gonna suffer

01:03:04.232 --> 01:03:07.800
for what you did to Belle and Gideon.

01:03:07.835 --> 01:03:10.770
You may think that you can stop me,

01:03:10.805 --> 01:03:13.306
but that doesn't mean
the Final Battle is over.

01:03:13.341 --> 01:03:17.910
After all, I'm not the one
who's going to kill the Savior.

01:03:18.222 --> 01:03:20.613
That's what I learned from the runes.

01:03:20.956 --> 01:03:24.049
Darkness can't snuff out the light.

01:03:24.191 --> 01:03:26.418
It's not strong enough.

01:03:26.453 --> 01:03:29.421
Only light can snuff out light.

01:03:30.222 --> 01:03:31.949
Gideon.

01:03:32.978 --> 01:03:34.744
You have his heart.

01:03:35.410 --> 01:03:36.800
Yes.

01:03:36.825 --> 01:03:39.126
And I commanded him to kill the Savior.

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:44.128
Not even my death can stop that.

01:03:45.776 --> 01:03:49.343
In fact, I suspect it would ensure it.

01:03:52.406 --> 01:03:54.057
Well...

01:03:54.523 --> 01:03:56.640
there's only one way to find out.

01:04:38.147 --> 01:04:40.381
I remember.

01:04:45.662 --> 01:04:47.896
Just in time, Savior.

01:04:49.097 --> 01:04:51.732
Henry. Go!

01:05:00.984 --> 01:05:02.711
Rumple?

01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:06.506
Belle.

01:05:06.531 --> 01:05:08.654
Yeah. I'm awake.

01:05:08.679 --> 01:05:10.413
The curse is broken.

01:05:11.952 --> 01:05:13.252
When I killed her.

01:05:15.586 --> 01:05:17.553
You killed your mother?

01:05:18.748 --> 01:05:20.781
W-Where's Gideon?

01:05:22.834 --> 01:05:24.107
I don't know.

01:05:24.131 --> 01:05:26.565
Still under her control.

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:28.534
But I think I know who to ask.

01:05:28.569 --> 01:05:30.101
Henry.

01:05:30.137 --> 01:05:31.825
C-Can you stop him?

01:05:31.850 --> 01:05:33.517
I don't intend to stop him.

01:05:35.989 --> 01:05:38.242
I intend to save him.

01:05:41.489 --> 01:05:42.655
Gideon.

01:05:42.690 --> 01:05:43.656
You don't want to do this.

01:05:43.691 --> 01:05:44.857
You can't win.

01:05:44.892 --> 01:05:46.926
Maybe. But I also can't give up.

01:05:49.625 --> 01:05:50.831
Henry!

01:05:51.699 --> 01:05:52.898
Let's go. Go!

01:06:04.039 --> 01:06:04.938
- You did it.
- Kinda.

01:06:04.973 --> 01:06:06.199
That won't hold very long.

01:06:06.224 --> 01:06:07.947
It's okay. The Black
Fairy's got his heart.

01:06:08.001 --> 01:06:09.723
Gold's gonna get it.
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:06:09.748 --> 01:06:12.382
I appreciate your optimism,
kid, but we got to go.

01:06:17.608 --> 01:06:19.308
You think his heart's down here?

01:06:19.333 --> 01:06:21.138
I know my mother.

01:06:21.174 --> 01:06:23.107
This is where she'd hide it.

01:06:23.142 --> 01:06:25.443
- If I find it...
- Aah!

01:06:25.478 --> 01:06:26.678
Belle, you all right?

01:06:26.713 --> 01:06:28.278
My ankle. I think it's twisted.

01:06:28.314 --> 01:06:30.410
- Well, let me fix it.
- No, no! Just go ahead.

01:06:30.435 --> 01:06:33.294
We're racing against the
clock. I'll only slow you down.

01:06:33.319 --> 01:06:36.119
Go. Save Emma! Save our son!

01:06:39.599 --> 01:06:40.935
Can you see him?

01:06:40.951 --> 01:06:43.417
We lost him. But he won't be far behind.

01:06:43.453 --> 01:06:45.719
I'm so sorry that I ever doubted you.

01:06:45.754 --> 01:06:47.404
I know. It's okay. It was the curse.

01:06:47.429 --> 01:06:48.787
I'm just happy it's broken.

01:06:48.812 --> 01:06:50.311
We are, too.

01:06:51.665 --> 01:06:53.364
Oh, Dad.

01:06:59.628 --> 01:07:01.095
Some honeymoon, huh?

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:03.354
Oh, we'll get there. We'll get there.

01:07:03.379 --> 01:07:04.678
Okay.

01:07:23.099 --> 01:07:26.200
She left him with one last command.

01:07:26.236 --> 01:07:29.203
Kill you no matter what.

01:07:29.753 --> 01:07:31.237
Well, then we'll kill him.

01:07:31.283 --> 01:07:33.120
No. It's a trap.

01:07:33.433 --> 01:07:37.300
If Gideon kills Emma, then
light will be destroyed.

01:07:37.336 --> 01:07:40.437
And if Emma kills him,
then she'll darken herself

01:07:40.472 --> 01:07:42.067
and light will be destroyed anyway.

01:07:42.255 --> 01:07:43.387
You don't have to kill him.

01:07:43.412 --> 01:07:45.678
Just hold him off until
Gold gets his heart.

01:07:45.746 --> 01:07:47.802
Well, there's no holding him off.

01:07:47.992 --> 01:07:49.358
But she is right.

01:07:51.043 --> 01:07:52.663
It's a trap, and it's perfect.

01:07:52.688 --> 01:07:54.476
No matter what, darkness wins.

01:07:54.501 --> 01:07:56.680
I'm not telling you
to give up. You can't.

01:07:57.079 --> 01:07:58.742
Emma, you of all people should know,

01:07:58.767 --> 01:08:00.547
there's always a third way.

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:11.547
Remember when you first
came to Storybrooke?

01:08:11.774 --> 01:08:13.165
We hated each other.

01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:15.130
- Regina.
- No, it's true.

01:08:15.165 --> 01:08:18.066
I was Henry's mother,
but you said you were.

01:08:18.234 --> 01:08:20.068
And we fought.

01:08:20.228 --> 01:08:22.728
And oh, boy, did we ever fight.

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:27.041
But you found a third way.

01:08:28.171 --> 01:08:30.538
We were both his mother.

01:08:31.765 --> 01:08:34.899
Earlier today, I saw my evil half...

01:08:36.667 --> 01:08:38.334
be selfless.

01:08:39.064 --> 01:08:43.299
She saved us all. I
never saw that coming.

01:08:43.564 --> 01:08:46.399
Just like however you're
going to get out of this,

01:08:46.966 --> 01:08:49.233
you haven't seen yet.

01:08:49.874 --> 01:08:51.389
But you will.

01:08:52.042 --> 01:08:53.858
Sounds like you're talking about hope.

01:08:54.444 --> 01:08:56.692
Something you taught
me all those years ago

01:08:56.716 --> 01:09:00.081
when... you didn't give up on me.

01:09:00.491 --> 01:09:02.417
What should I do?

01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:04.953
You'll know when the time comes.

01:09:07.558 --> 01:09:09.524
I'm afraid that time has indeed come.

01:09:10.129 --> 01:09:12.099
- Son of a bitch!
- Dad, stop!

01:09:12.696 --> 01:09:14.412
I got this.

01:09:19.577 --> 01:09:21.010
Let her go.

01:09:39.598 --> 01:09:41.365
There's your heart, Gideon.

01:09:42.305 --> 01:09:45.673
Now let's save you. Let's stop you.

01:09:45.707 --> 01:09:48.774
But why would you stop him?

01:09:48.810 --> 01:09:50.687
Now, remember what Mother said.

01:09:50.712 --> 01:09:54.413
"With the death of the
Savior, you can have it all."

01:09:54.616 --> 01:09:56.850
You're nothing but a
devil on my shoulder.

01:09:56.885 --> 01:09:59.160
Doesn't mean to say I'm wrong, dearie.

01:09:59.185 --> 01:10:03.293
This is our last chance
to finally get everything.

01:10:03.318 --> 01:10:05.754
Love and power.

01:10:06.145 --> 01:10:09.279
All you have to do now
is put the heart down

01:10:09.315 --> 01:10:12.784
and let our boy finish his mission.

01:10:16.198 --> 01:10:17.784
No.

01:10:18.565 --> 01:10:20.690
I won't betray my family.

01:10:21.744 --> 01:10:24.111
I will do the right thing.

01:10:25.482 --> 01:10:28.049
I was destined to become the Savior.

01:10:28.084 --> 01:10:30.931
And now you're fated to change magic!

01:10:31.361 --> 01:10:34.269
In this new world, we
will make the rules.

01:10:34.294 --> 01:10:35.621
Belle wants to see the world.

01:10:35.646 --> 01:10:38.658
Well, go on. Spend 100 years seeing it,

01:10:38.683 --> 01:10:40.583
then 100 years wrecking it.

01:10:43.707 --> 01:10:45.106
No.

01:10:46.443 --> 01:10:50.879
It won't... be... real.

01:10:53.268 --> 01:10:55.167
Gideon, stop.

01:10:55.192 --> 01:10:57.047
Do not kill Emma Swan.

01:11:03.799 --> 01:11:06.300
Did you really think it
was gonna be that easy?

01:11:06.335 --> 01:11:09.269
This is the Black Fairy's
spell we're talking about here!

01:11:10.092 --> 01:11:12.405
You may want to do the right thing,

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:18.878
but as we all know, we can't
always get what we want.

01:11:18.913 --> 01:11:20.513
Now, can we?

01:11:35.078 --> 01:11:36.911
No one's going to save you.

01:11:44.929 --> 01:11:47.329
No one needs to save me! I'm the Savior!

01:11:50.598 --> 01:11:52.598
I'm fighting for the people I love.

01:11:56.004 --> 01:11:58.340
Ultimately, I am a hero.

01:11:58.365 --> 01:12:00.298
I am hope. I am light!

01:12:01.168 --> 01:12:02.501
And light cannot destroy darkness.

01:12:02.536 --> 01:12:03.902
It can only create more light.

01:12:03.937 --> 01:12:05.738
I will not kill innocents!

01:12:06.449 --> 01:12:07.854
I will do what all saviors must!

01:12:07.879 --> 01:12:08.979
I will give hope...

01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:18.149
no matter what the cost.

01:12:22.641 --> 01:12:23.674
No!

01:12:33.829 --> 01:12:35.636
I'm sorry, Emma.

01:12:37.899 --> 01:12:40.266
I was hoping you'd save us both.

01:13:16.675 --> 01:13:18.876
I failed you, Belle.

01:13:20.115 --> 01:13:22.115
I failed our family.

01:13:23.985 --> 01:13:26.051
I made the right choice.

01:13:27.852 --> 01:13:29.955
It just didn't work out.

01:13:37.337 --> 01:13:39.298
Hey.

01:13:55.324 --> 01:13:57.024
I love you.

01:14:05.918 --> 01:14:07.450
I love you, too.

01:14:09.612 --> 01:14:11.379
I love you, too!

01:14:49.572 --> 01:14:51.083
Is that...

01:14:51.841 --> 01:14:53.341
It's Gideon.

01:15:00.537 --> 01:15:02.517
A fresh start.

01:15:03.238 --> 01:15:04.804
A happy ending.

01:15:05.724 --> 01:15:07.154
No.

01:15:07.905 --> 01:15:09.972
A happy beginning.

01:15:31.805 --> 01:15:32.938
Henry!

01:15:36.672 --> 01:15:38.872
I think this belongs to you.

01:15:47.813 --> 01:15:51.915
"When Good and Evil both did the
right thing, faith was restored.

01:15:52.225 --> 01:15:54.591
The final battle was won."

01:15:58.684 --> 01:15:59.749
That's it.

01:16:00.076 --> 01:16:02.719
That's all? No "The End"?

01:16:03.224 --> 01:16:04.086
No.

01:16:04.122 --> 01:16:07.424
'Course not. Because this isn't the end.

01:16:07.459 --> 01:16:11.227
I mean, maybe of this book,
but... it isn't the end, end.

01:16:11.396 --> 01:16:14.462
So... what now?

01:16:14.487 --> 01:16:18.688
Now? Now we get to see what's next.

01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:21.907
Believing in even the
possibility of a happy ending

01:16:21.923 --> 01:16:25.358
is a powerful thing, but living
with that kind of belief...

01:16:25.393 --> 01:16:27.994
that's the most powerful thing of all.

01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:29.612
That's hope.

01:16:30.159 --> 01:16:31.807
So you asked, "What now?"

01:16:31.832 --> 01:16:34.866
Now we get to keep going on.

01:16:35.930 --> 01:16:39.268
We get to keep doing what we love...

01:16:39.409 --> 01:16:41.580
with the people we love.

01:16:41.998 --> 01:16:44.545
An ending isn't happiness.

01:16:46.203 --> 01:16:47.769
Being together is.

01:17:13.584 --> 01:17:15.094
Hmm?

01:17:58.556 --> 01:18:03.416
_

01:20:31.118 --> 01:20:33.585
Ready for a new adventure?

01:22:40.623 --> 01:22:42.748
_

01:23:12.535 --> 01:23:14.547
Uh... hello?

01:23:14.572 --> 01:23:16.772
Hi. Are you Henry Mills?

01:23:19.588 --> 01:23:20.954
Yeah.

01:23:21.713 --> 01:23:23.557
Yeah. Who are you?

01:23:23.677 --> 01:23:26.323
My name's Lucy. I'm your daughter.

01:23:27.795 --> 01:23:29.128
I don't have a daughter.

01:23:29.163 --> 01:23:30.498
Yeah, you do.

01:23:30.523 --> 01:23:33.256
Now come on. Your family needs you.

01:23:33.326 --> 01:23:37.826
