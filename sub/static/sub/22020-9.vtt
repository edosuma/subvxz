WEBVTT

00:04.601 --> 00:06.235
<i>You're a good cop, Adam.</i>

00:06.260 --> 00:08.061
You're really good at catching bad guys.

00:08.086 --> 00:10.955
And yet... And yet you work
right next to one

00:10.996 --> 00:13.337
of the worst men in Chicago.

00:13.415 --> 00:16.594
A man who built his career
crossing the line

00:16.628 --> 00:18.829
and breaking the law.

00:18.864 --> 00:20.867
And yet you can't catch a criminal?

00:20.923 --> 00:22.523
How long do you think
you're gonna be able

00:22.597 --> 00:23.797
- to jerk me around?
- I gave you the video.

00:23.851 --> 00:25.273
The video of the fight.

00:25.289 --> 00:27.931
That tap dance with Halstead
punching a bystander

00:27.970 --> 00:29.134
while he's trying to save a kid's life?

00:29.172 --> 00:30.839
You told me you wanted something

00:30.873 --> 00:32.345
that crossed the line...
That crossed the line.

00:32.380 --> 00:34.152
Do you know how hard it was
for me to give that to you?

00:34.177 --> 00:36.111
I told you I wanted something on Voight.

00:36.145 --> 00:38.780
Something actionable.

00:43.085 --> 00:45.688
I can't give you what you want.

00:46.055 --> 00:47.823
I can't.

00:47.857 --> 00:49.528
Yes, you will.

00:49.826 --> 00:51.224
Or your sister will go to jail,

00:51.249 --> 00:53.962
and your little nephew will
have to learn all the names

00:53.996 --> 00:55.897
of his new foster brothers.

00:55.932 --> 01:00.168
And the poster boy
for corrupt police in Chicago

01:00.203 --> 01:01.814
will not be Hank Voight.

01:01.938 --> 01:04.290
That will be you.

01:05.007 --> 01:08.710
You got 24 hours,
or I will bury your ass.

01:47.383 --> 01:49.600
Where are you going?

01:49.897 --> 01:54.534
Um, I gotta go see a guy about a job.

01:54.569 --> 01:55.936
Security gig.

02:00.641 --> 02:02.542
Come on. We have to celebrate.

02:02.577 --> 02:05.145
- Um, celebrate what?
- Our two week anniversary.

02:07.682 --> 02:09.082
I can't be late.

02:12.520 --> 02:14.955
So, Ryan, I have a question.

02:17.992 --> 02:20.627
Am I seeing you again tonight?

02:23.164 --> 02:24.598
Hell yeah.

02:30.104 --> 02:32.906
Good, Caitlin.

02:32.940 --> 02:34.674
So, you just moved here?

02:34.709 --> 02:36.743
- Yeah, last week.
- Hmm.

02:36.778 --> 02:38.512
Looking for a good league
for my daughter.

02:38.546 --> 02:41.581
Oh, this is the one.
Good coaches, good families.

02:41.616 --> 02:42.849
You're gonna love this neighborhood.

02:44.118 --> 02:46.586
Get in there, Caitlin! Go for it!

02:47.555 --> 02:49.756
So, Julianne...

02:49.791 --> 02:52.826
I was told that you could hook me up.

02:52.860 --> 02:55.495
Excuse me?

02:55.530 --> 02:57.764
I just... I need something for my back.

02:57.799 --> 03:00.767
I got into a car accident,
and I'm in a lot of pain.

03:00.802 --> 03:02.803
It sounds like you need a doctor.

03:04.639 --> 03:07.140
Sarah Rathe told me that you could help.

03:08.876 --> 03:10.143
I have cash.

03:14.982 --> 03:17.484
- How much do you need?
- How much can I get?

03:22.824 --> 03:26.626
Hey, Sue, I need to help out
our new neighbor.

03:26.661 --> 03:28.128
Um, would you mind dropping
Dylan and Caitlin

03:28.162 --> 03:29.129
- back at the house?
- Mm-hmm, sure.

03:35.736 --> 03:38.138
- It's $80 a pill.
- That's pretty high.

03:38.172 --> 03:41.174
It's real Oxy.
None of that Chinese crap.

03:41.209 --> 03:42.576
Okay.

03:45.913 --> 03:47.581
- Wait here.
- Wait, I'll just go with you.

03:47.615 --> 03:49.916
No, the guy's skittish.

03:49.951 --> 03:51.251
Don't worry. I'll be right back.

03:59.026 --> 04:00.227
- Did you copy that?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

04:00.261 --> 04:01.761
<i>Already in the location.</i>

04:03.030 --> 04:05.232
Uh-huh.

04:05.266 --> 04:07.734
Yeah, okay.

04:07.768 --> 04:09.569
I got the eye.
I'll stay with her, Hailey.

04:43.771 --> 04:46.907
So, we're gonna bust her
in front of her kids?

04:46.941 --> 04:49.109
Do you wanna tell Sarge
we lost 1505 funds

04:49.143 --> 04:50.644
and got played by a soccer mom?

04:50.678 --> 04:52.379
I don't know.

04:52.413 --> 04:55.048
After the Sinaloan cartel,
this feels like small potatoes.

04:55.082 --> 04:58.585
17 ODs in this area in the last month.

04:58.619 --> 05:00.620
- Big potato.
- All right, after you.

05:00.655 --> 05:01.888
- Help, help!
- Somebody... Sue!

05:01.923 --> 05:03.223
- Help!
- Please!

05:03.257 --> 05:04.758
Somebody help! Please, somebody!

05:04.792 --> 05:05.992
- Help!
- Our mom's inside!

05:06.027 --> 05:07.093
She won't wake up!

05:07.128 --> 05:08.128
- Where is she?
- Please!

05:08.162 --> 05:09.396
She's in the bathroom!

05:09.430 --> 05:10.964
We're police.

05:10.998 --> 05:12.332
You guys stay here. Stay put, all right?

05:14.268 --> 05:17.103
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, hey, hey, hey.

05:17.138 --> 05:18.605
Look at me, look at me, look at me!

05:18.639 --> 05:19.806
This is Detective Jay Halstead.

05:19.840 --> 05:21.107
Badge number 51163.

05:21.142 --> 05:22.142
I need you guys to roll an ambo

05:22.176 --> 05:23.677
to 4222 South Keller.

05:23.711 --> 05:24.911
We got a female overdose victim.

05:24.946 --> 05:26.780
She's conv... Hey, guys, stay back!

05:26.814 --> 05:28.014
- Julianne!
- She's convulsing pretty bad.

05:28.049 --> 05:29.082
Send help quick.

05:29.116 --> 05:30.283
I'm gonna get them out of here.

05:30.318 --> 05:32.252
Hey, hey, hey! Julianne!

05:32.286 --> 05:33.620
Julianne, stay with me.

05:33.654 --> 05:35.006
Stay with me, Julianne!

05:39.293 --> 05:41.161
She stole our money to buy her fix.

05:41.681 --> 05:43.148
Looks like she was trying to get high

05:43.173 --> 05:44.364
before her kids got home.

05:44.398 --> 05:46.266
We found a straight razor
and a white powder substance.

05:46.300 --> 05:47.701
Field tested for Oxy.

05:47.735 --> 05:49.169
She probably snorted it.

05:49.203 --> 05:50.937
We tried like hell,
we couldn't revive her.

05:50.972 --> 05:53.273
We'll crack off a vice report
on your attempt to buy.

05:53.307 --> 05:54.774
Dump her phone.

05:54.809 --> 05:56.176
She must have reached out
to her supplier.

05:56.210 --> 05:58.945
- All right.
- Hello, Hank.

05:58.980 --> 06:00.447
Hey, Denny.

06:00.481 --> 06:02.182
So he called you, too?

06:02.216 --> 06:05.318
He? Just here working a case.

06:05.353 --> 06:07.821
Good. Now you own it.

06:07.855 --> 06:09.122
I'm not following.

06:09.156 --> 06:11.124
The victim in the case
is Julianne Wells.

06:11.158 --> 06:13.693
Daughter of the Honorable Judge Wells.

06:13.728 --> 06:16.663
Tommy Wells?

06:16.697 --> 06:18.898
That's right.

06:18.933 --> 06:21.801
Daughter of a white judge.

06:21.836 --> 06:25.839
The opioid crisis is finally
going to hit front page

06:25.873 --> 06:27.140
of the "Tribune."

06:29.076 --> 06:30.310
- Hey.
- Coffee?

06:30.344 --> 06:31.811
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

06:31.846 --> 06:33.980
How'd it work out with your boyfriend?

06:34.015 --> 06:35.982
- Not great.
- Can you fix it?

06:36.017 --> 06:37.684
Yeah, I think it got broke

06:37.718 --> 06:39.152
in a way you can't really fix.

06:39.186 --> 06:40.887
- That sucks.
- Mm.

06:40.921 --> 06:42.722
Um, well hey, you did right by the team.

06:42.757 --> 06:45.392
You did right by Voight.
That's something, right?

06:45.426 --> 06:46.393
All right, guys.

06:46.427 --> 06:47.394
Julianne Hudson.

06:47.428 --> 06:49.062
Divorced, mother of two.

06:49.096 --> 06:50.864
Been in and out of rehab
for the past two years.

06:50.898 --> 06:53.400
And you had no idea
she was Judge Wells' daughter?

06:53.434 --> 06:55.268
She's going by Hudson.
It's her married name.

06:55.302 --> 06:56.936
We did know she's a small-time dealer.

06:56.971 --> 06:58.872
Two of the ODs said she
hooked them up with Oxy.

06:58.906 --> 07:00.240
We were flipping her
to get her supplier.

07:00.274 --> 07:02.008
Yeah, look, I talked to my C.I.s.

07:02.043 --> 07:03.877
This move into Lincoln Park
is not the cartels.

07:03.911 --> 07:05.278
It's a new player.

07:05.312 --> 07:06.880
Nobody on our radar or Narcotics'.

07:06.914 --> 07:08.181
Pushing legit Oxy pills.

07:08.215 --> 07:10.083
Well, we dumped Julianne's phone,

07:10.117 --> 07:12.252
and the last call she made
before she OD'd

07:12.286 --> 07:14.087
was to a Vance Williams for 32 seconds.

07:14.121 --> 07:17.190
We ran muds and tolls on
the 17 ODs in Lincoln Park.

07:17.224 --> 07:18.258
Six of them called this guy Vance, too.

07:18.292 --> 07:19.759
Hmm.

07:19.794 --> 07:21.528
Got his, uh, social security records.

07:21.562 --> 07:23.897
Been working at the Wolcott
Grill the last nine months.

07:23.931 --> 07:26.066
All right, so why don't you
two go talk to him?

07:26.100 --> 07:28.535
Listen, it's new turf,
but it's the same game.

07:28.569 --> 07:31.271
Bust the dealers,
flip the minnows into sharks.

07:31.305 --> 07:32.906
Copy that.

07:32.940 --> 07:35.208
You know, before Tommy Wells
was a judge,

07:35.242 --> 07:36.776
he was a cop.

07:36.811 --> 07:38.778
We were in the Academy together.

07:38.813 --> 07:40.980
Good police.

07:41.015 --> 07:43.083
Let's do him right.

07:46.020 --> 07:48.221
Parent's not supposed to have favorites,

07:48.255 --> 07:51.558
but Julianne was my favorite.

07:51.592 --> 07:53.560
She loved sports.

07:53.594 --> 07:56.129
- That's how she hurt her knee.
- Hmm.

07:56.163 --> 07:58.798
And then came the operations.

07:58.833 --> 07:59.899
The pain pills.

08:01.869 --> 08:04.938
Spent my whole career
throwing drug addicts in jail

08:04.972 --> 08:07.240
and my own daughter
went down the rabbit hole.

08:09.443 --> 08:10.910
I'm so sorry.

08:12.947 --> 08:15.081
Listen, uh...

08:15.116 --> 08:16.950
I talked to Denny Woods.

08:16.984 --> 08:20.153
We're gonna pursue
a narcotics induced homicide.

08:20.187 --> 08:22.922
So if you can point us in a direction...

08:22.957 --> 08:26.092
I really wish I could.

08:26.127 --> 08:29.929
The deeper in Julianne got,
the more she isolated herself.

08:32.032 --> 08:34.134
It was our drug companies
and our doctors

08:34.168 --> 08:37.102
who got us hooked.

08:37.138 --> 08:40.506
They called it medicine.

08:40.541 --> 08:43.476
We unleashed this monster on ourselves.

08:47.214 --> 08:49.115
She was my little girl.

08:53.053 --> 08:55.188
I lost my son a few years ago.

08:58.526 --> 09:00.026
Pain doesn't go away.

09:02.329 --> 09:05.632
There is some consolation
when justice is done.

09:07.668 --> 09:11.371
Makes the hole a little shallower.

09:11.405 --> 09:13.306
We're gonna do everything we can.

09:13.340 --> 09:14.307
Yeah.

09:15.943 --> 09:17.844
All right.

09:19.446 --> 09:22.148
Italian Pino grigio here.

09:22.183 --> 09:24.517
- Okay.
- Crisp, dry.

09:24.552 --> 09:26.553
A lot of lemon and lime.

09:26.587 --> 09:29.222
Even some green apple in the finish.

09:29.256 --> 09:32.091
I think you're gonna like it.

09:32.126 --> 09:33.593
I do. You know your stuff, Vance.

09:33.627 --> 09:35.895
- How long you worked here?
- Not that long.

09:35.930 --> 09:37.997
And you've already made
a name for yourself.

09:38.032 --> 09:40.366
I hear that you are the man to see.

09:40.401 --> 09:41.935
Sorry, tell me your name again?

09:41.969 --> 09:44.437
Diana.

09:44.471 --> 09:46.573
So, what do you want, Diana?

09:46.607 --> 09:48.508
I want to have fun.

09:48.542 --> 09:51.244
And I want to help
other people have fun.

09:51.278 --> 09:53.012
See, I work at a tennis club.

09:53.047 --> 09:54.414
There's a lot of women.
A lot of free time.

09:54.448 --> 09:56.583
Not a lot of supervision.

09:56.617 --> 09:59.419
Virgin territory, Vance.
Without the virgins.

09:59.453 --> 10:01.254
- I'm listening.
- Mmm-hmm.

10:01.288 --> 10:04.557
They wanna party.
They don't like the needles.

10:04.592 --> 10:06.192
Do you like to party?

10:06.227 --> 10:09.929
I do. But...

10:09.964 --> 10:12.131
Do you know where I can get some Oxy?

10:12.166 --> 10:14.701
Um...

10:14.735 --> 10:16.069
So, after that thing
with the judge's daughter...

10:16.103 --> 10:17.403
Yeah?

10:17.438 --> 10:18.538
Suppliers are gonna be laying low.

10:18.572 --> 10:19.606
- But...
- Okay.

10:19.640 --> 10:22.408
I have a recreational stash.

10:22.443 --> 10:24.644
Sweet.

10:24.678 --> 10:26.145
I'll be free in ten minutes.

10:26.180 --> 10:28.548
Actually, you won't be.

10:30.484 --> 10:32.986
Chicago PD.

10:33.020 --> 10:35.421
- Bitch.
- Hey.

10:35.456 --> 10:37.590
- You good, Kim?
- I'm fine.

10:42.096 --> 10:43.663
Know her?

10:43.697 --> 10:45.598
I may have seen her at the bar.

10:45.633 --> 10:49.602
'Cause your manager saw you
talking to Julianne yesterday.

10:49.637 --> 10:53.406
After which, she snorted 600
milligrams of OxyContin.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.575
That's a bummer, but that's not on me.

10:55.609 --> 10:58.478
'Cause your recreational stash,

10:58.512 --> 11:00.580
same pills that killed Julianne.

11:00.614 --> 11:03.683
- I want a lawyer.
- You from Chicago?

11:03.717 --> 11:05.251
What's that got to do with it?

11:05.286 --> 11:07.120
- Are you from Chicago?
- Yeah, Wilmette.

11:07.154 --> 11:10.256
So then you know how this city works.

11:10.291 --> 11:13.293
I mean, this... this is
the daughter of a judge.

11:13.327 --> 11:16.529
So, someone's gonna pay for this, right?

11:16.563 --> 11:18.698
I mean, if I were you,

11:18.732 --> 11:20.500
I'd wanna put it on my supplier.

11:20.534 --> 11:23.603
But if you wanna protect him,

11:23.637 --> 11:25.538
I'm happy to go with you.

11:25.572 --> 11:27.974
And that means you'll take the full ride

11:28.008 --> 11:30.276
for the homicide charge.

11:30.311 --> 11:34.013
You know, I kinda hope he eats it.

11:34.048 --> 11:35.715
'Cause this means
we get to go home early.

11:35.749 --> 11:38.384
So, who's your supplier?

11:41.221 --> 11:43.723
Last chance, Vance.

11:48.395 --> 11:50.697
- Let's go.
- I want a deal.

11:54.568 --> 11:56.469
And in return for his cooperation,

11:56.503 --> 11:58.304
aside from his immediate release,

11:58.339 --> 12:00.406
my client wants full immunity.

12:00.441 --> 12:02.408
Sergeant, we got him on
Intent to Distribute,

12:02.443 --> 12:04.143
selling to an undercover police officer,

12:04.178 --> 12:05.411
and you want to release him?

12:05.446 --> 12:07.180
Just long enough
to smoke out his source.

12:07.214 --> 12:09.148
He'll have a tracker on.

12:09.183 --> 12:10.583
There's no way I can agree to that.

12:16.790 --> 12:20.226
Your Honor, we are all
so sorry for your loss.

12:20.260 --> 12:22.261
I heard you were here.

12:25.432 --> 12:27.533
Are you guys making a deal
with my daughter's killer?

12:27.568 --> 12:29.202
I haven't signed off on it.

12:29.236 --> 12:31.170
Just so you know,
I'm not a killer, okay?

12:31.205 --> 12:32.505
Your daughter was a junkie,

12:32.539 --> 12:34.107
and whether it was me or somebody else,

12:34.141 --> 12:35.408
she was gonna find her pills.

12:39.713 --> 12:43.716
This opioid addiction
is destroying our country.

12:43.751 --> 12:48.554
So, if we have to make
some unsavory deals...

12:50.224 --> 12:52.191
So be it.

13:00.234 --> 13:02.368
24 hours, partial immunity.

13:02.403 --> 13:03.536
Listen to me.

13:03.570 --> 13:05.238
You set up that meeting tonight.

13:05.272 --> 13:07.407
Or this deal is off the table.
You understand?

13:13.280 --> 13:15.148
Still no sign of Frank Barrett.

13:15.182 --> 13:17.283
Vance and his supplier
decided not to show up.

13:17.317 --> 13:18.718
Well, we just got here,
but according to the tracker,

13:18.752 --> 13:20.553
Vance is still inside his house.

13:20.587 --> 13:22.755
All right, come on.

13:22.790 --> 13:25.324
Kev, you take the front.
We'll take the back.

13:25.359 --> 13:26.459
Got it.

13:40.174 --> 13:41.340
Antonio?

13:41.375 --> 13:42.642
Back door.

13:48.382 --> 13:49.482
- Door.
- Got it.

13:50.784 --> 13:51.751
Moving.

14:04.731 --> 14:06.532
- Body.
- Got it.

14:10.971 --> 14:14.340
Hey, Kev, we found Vance.

14:14.374 --> 14:15.808
It's not good.

14:22.201 --> 14:23.967
Forced entry to the rear.

14:23.987 --> 14:25.554
House wasn't tossed.

14:25.588 --> 14:27.065
M.E. puts time of death at 11:30.

14:27.112 --> 14:28.471
Single gun shot.

14:28.510 --> 14:30.246
Talking to the neighbors.
Nothing so far.

14:30.315 --> 14:32.250
Any intel on Vance's supplier?

14:32.324 --> 14:33.717
No, just what he told us.

14:33.752 --> 14:35.552
Frank Barrett. We're looking into it.

14:35.587 --> 14:37.521
So, all crime techs found
was one shoe print.

14:37.555 --> 14:38.775
It's a size 11.

14:38.807 --> 14:40.898
Victim was a size nine.
So it could be the killer.

14:40.925 --> 14:43.060
But it could also be the FedEx guy.

14:43.094 --> 14:44.323
All right, get a cast.

14:44.348 --> 14:45.829
- Put it into evidence.
- Yep.

14:48.033 --> 14:49.533
Got a kill shot to the head.

14:49.567 --> 14:51.433
Close range, no struggle.

14:51.498 --> 14:53.132
This was an execution.

14:53.166 --> 14:55.334
Spoke to the crime techs.
There's no prints.

14:55.382 --> 14:57.054
So the guy was a professional.

14:57.093 --> 14:58.405
Bullet?

14:58.430 --> 14:59.728
I'll get it over to ballistics.

14:59.770 --> 15:01.137
All right, check the neighborhood

15:01.164 --> 15:02.230
- for security cameras, will you?
- Yeah.

15:02.265 --> 15:03.732
- Hey, boss?
- Yeah.

15:03.766 --> 15:04.766
Okay, I'm looking in the closet,

15:04.801 --> 15:06.201
And there's at least 15 to 20K

15:06.235 --> 15:08.082
in a shoe box on the floor in there.

15:08.805 --> 15:10.439
- Give me a minute.
- Yeah.

15:22.018 --> 15:23.085
You want us to voucher it for you?

15:23.110 --> 15:24.243
No, I'll take care of it.

15:24.295 --> 15:25.419
Honestly, Boss, I can handle it.

15:25.451 --> 15:27.419
Sarge, we found something.

15:30.423 --> 15:31.990
- What's up?
- This was in the fire pit.

15:32.025 --> 15:33.825
- Is that prescription bottles?
- Yeah.

15:33.860 --> 15:35.727
There's a bunch of them.
Looks like he torched them.

15:35.762 --> 15:37.621
But you can still make out
bits of the label.

15:37.646 --> 15:38.697
- Mmm.
- OxyContin.

15:38.731 --> 15:40.032
And they all look like they
were written by the same guy.

15:40.057 --> 15:42.667
- A Dr. Lewis Macy.
- All right, get them over to the lab.

15:42.702 --> 15:43.769
See if you can find some more names

15:43.803 --> 15:45.103
and go talk to this Lewis Macy.

15:52.145 --> 15:53.712
Kim Kelly. Laura Henderson.

15:53.746 --> 15:56.415
Are those patients of yours?

15:56.449 --> 15:58.050
Don't ring a bell.

15:58.084 --> 15:59.785
Hey, do you write a lot
of pain prescriptions?

15:59.819 --> 16:02.120
- Opioids?
- Oh, gosh, no.

16:02.155 --> 16:04.222
- I call those slippery slopes.
- Hmm.

16:04.257 --> 16:06.925
One pill can take you
right to the bottom.

16:06.959 --> 16:09.061
Maybe you can help explain
why we found Oxy prescriptions

16:09.095 --> 16:11.563
for these patients written in your name.

16:11.597 --> 16:12.931
That's an easy one.

16:12.965 --> 16:14.933
My office was broken into
six months ago.

16:14.967 --> 16:17.536
They stole my computer, petty cash,

16:17.570 --> 16:18.804
and my prescription pads.

16:18.838 --> 16:20.906
Huh. You reported this?

16:20.940 --> 16:22.707
Definitely.

16:22.742 --> 16:25.043
A couple of your brothers
in blue came to investigate.

16:25.078 --> 16:27.879
Apparently other doctors
in this city got robbed, too.

16:27.914 --> 16:30.148
This is a real shame,
the times we live in.

16:30.183 --> 16:31.983
Yeah.

16:32.018 --> 16:33.518
Do you know a guy named Frank Barrett?

16:34.854 --> 16:36.755
I don't.

16:36.789 --> 16:38.924
- Doctor?
- Ah, now if you'll excuse me,

16:38.958 --> 16:40.258
I do have patients waiting.

16:40.293 --> 16:42.928
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

16:42.962 --> 16:45.764
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

16:45.798 --> 16:48.934
Dr. Lewis Macy. Family doctor.

16:48.968 --> 16:50.068
Two kids in high school.

16:50.103 --> 16:51.903
Divorce, no priors.

16:51.938 --> 16:54.072
And no apparent connection
to our DOA Vance Williams.

16:54.107 --> 16:55.740
No phone calls. No E-mails.

16:55.775 --> 16:57.175
These two never crossed path
electronically.

16:57.210 --> 16:58.643
And I talked to robbery.

16:58.678 --> 17:00.612
Dr. Macy did file a burglary report.

17:00.646 --> 17:02.614
And his alibi for the night
of Vance's murder checks out.

17:02.648 --> 17:03.915
It was Parent Night at Webster Prep.

17:03.950 --> 17:05.784
And he's a size nine.

17:05.818 --> 17:07.185
Not a match for the shoe print
we found at the crime scene.

17:07.220 --> 17:08.920
Still, I wanna get a sneak and peek

17:08.954 --> 17:10.188
on the doctor's finances.

17:10.223 --> 17:11.957
What about this Frank Barrett guy?

17:11.991 --> 17:13.825
There's eight Frank Barretts
in Chicago, Sarge.

17:13.859 --> 17:16.694
But my money is on the one who
runs this bar called Blazes.

17:16.729 --> 17:18.630
That's where Vance Williams
used to work.

17:18.664 --> 17:20.598
And two of the names we found
on the prescription bottles

17:20.633 --> 17:21.833
have one thing in common.

17:21.867 --> 17:23.300
They both used to work at Blazes.

17:23.336 --> 17:24.970
All right, so let's get some
dirt on him,

17:25.003 --> 17:26.505
then scoop him up.

17:29.308 --> 17:31.042
Frank Barrett?

17:31.077 --> 17:33.145
- Do I know you?
- Chicago PD.

17:33.179 --> 17:34.980
We wanted to talk to you
about one of your employees,

17:35.014 --> 17:36.515
Vance Williams.

17:36.549 --> 17:38.150
Oh, yeah. He's a former employee.

17:38.184 --> 17:40.018
My manager told me what
happened to him last night.

17:40.052 --> 17:41.686
This freaking city, huh?

17:41.721 --> 17:43.288
Yeah, do you have any idea
who killed him?

17:43.322 --> 17:45.891
No idea, he's just some guy
who used to work for me.

17:45.925 --> 17:47.792
So, Vance was pushing illegal opiods.

17:47.827 --> 17:49.227
We also know some other people
in the ring,

17:49.262 --> 17:50.629
and the one thing they all have
in common...

17:50.663 --> 17:52.197
They've all worked for you.

17:52.231 --> 17:53.732
Oh, you think that I got
something to do with this?

17:53.766 --> 17:55.200
You are the boss, right?

17:55.234 --> 17:57.335
It's not a church, man. It's a bar.

17:57.370 --> 17:59.905
Yeah. Where were you last night?

17:59.939 --> 18:01.973
I was at my bar.

18:02.008 --> 18:03.575
Till close.

18:03.609 --> 18:05.343
Look, it's tragic what happened
to Vance,

18:05.378 --> 18:07.746
but I had nothing to do with it.

18:07.780 --> 18:09.080
So if you guys are done fishing here,

18:09.115 --> 18:11.183
you'll excuse me. I have to get to work.

18:13.586 --> 18:15.220
That's a nice ride for a bartender.

18:15.254 --> 18:17.189
Bar owner.

18:17.223 --> 18:20.225
A man can make a good living
selling booze in Chicago.

18:23.930 --> 18:25.163
Why don't we take a ride to the bar?

18:25.198 --> 18:27.165
- Check out his alibi?
- Mmm-hmm.

18:29.101 --> 18:30.835
All right, what have you got?

18:30.870 --> 18:32.204
We have the Trap and Trace
on Barrett's phone.

18:32.238 --> 18:33.939
Like we hoped, Barrett made a phone call

18:33.973 --> 18:35.740
30 seconds after he talked
to Halstead and Upton.

18:35.775 --> 18:37.242
Yeah, it's definitely a Chicago number,

18:37.276 --> 18:39.277
but you're not gonna believe
who it belongs to.

18:45.251 --> 18:46.785
Chicago PD.

18:50.223 --> 18:51.356
Mind if we come in?

18:51.390 --> 18:52.691
Um...

18:52.725 --> 18:54.059
All right, come on. Over here.

18:54.093 --> 18:56.795
- What do you want?
- Where is he?

18:56.829 --> 18:58.230
- Who, what?
- Hey, look at me.

18:58.264 --> 18:59.698
- Where is he?
- Antonio?

19:02.969 --> 19:04.302
What's this?

19:04.337 --> 19:06.104
Sit down. We have the same question.

19:06.138 --> 19:09.941
You just got a call from Frank Barrett.

19:09.976 --> 19:13.078
Yeah. Frank's my cousin.

19:17.149 --> 19:20.252
The Vance Williams evidence folder.

19:20.286 --> 19:21.653
I'm doing the case report.

19:21.687 --> 19:23.255
I wanna double-check evidence,

19:23.289 --> 19:24.823
cross reference to make sure
I don't leave anything out.

19:24.857 --> 19:26.291
Like a real detective.

19:27.460 --> 19:29.728
Was there any money
vouchered into evidence?

19:29.762 --> 19:31.229
- Is there any listed there?
- No.

19:31.264 --> 19:33.398
There's your answer.

19:33.432 --> 19:35.767
Why am I here? I didn't do anything.

19:35.801 --> 19:37.769
Don't worry, baby. It's all a mistake.

19:37.803 --> 19:39.137
Both interview rooms clear?

19:39.171 --> 19:40.939
Yeah, we just put in fresh linens.

19:40.973 --> 19:42.340
All right, her in one, Doc in two.

19:42.375 --> 19:44.175
Hold on, is there any way
we can do this together?

19:44.210 --> 19:45.644
That's not how this works.

19:45.678 --> 19:47.846
Can't you do something?

19:47.880 --> 19:50.782
- I'm on the case report.
- Good.

20:10.169 --> 20:12.170
<i>You want us to voucher it for you?</i>

20:15.041 --> 20:16.374
<i>No, I'll take care of it.</i>

20:16.409 --> 20:17.750
<i>Honestly, Boss, I can handle it.</i>

20:30.912 --> 20:33.246
Now help me out here, Doc.

20:33.288 --> 20:34.763
Just trying to fit some pieces together.

20:34.810 --> 20:36.446
So Frank Barrett is your cousin?

20:36.491 --> 20:38.233
Yeah, that's right. On my mother's side.

20:38.287 --> 20:40.646
And Andrea Scott is your girlfriend?

20:40.685 --> 20:41.929
- Yeah.
- Okay.

20:41.963 --> 20:43.832
She was pretty out of it.
Is she doing opioids?

20:43.857 --> 20:45.658
No, she has a legal prescription

20:45.692 --> 20:47.159
for medical marijuana.

20:47.194 --> 20:49.328
- You write it for her?
- It's for her migraines.

20:49.362 --> 20:51.330
Oh, got it.

20:51.364 --> 20:53.165
Okay, so you and cousin Frank

20:53.200 --> 20:55.668
are partners in
an illegal opioid business.

20:55.702 --> 20:58.037
No, I already told you somebody stole

20:58.071 --> 20:59.071
- my prescription pads.
- Stop.

20:59.105 --> 21:00.706
You lied to us.

21:00.740 --> 21:01.941
You said you didn't know
who Frank Barrett was.

21:01.975 --> 21:03.676
I was nervous.

21:03.710 --> 21:05.177
I didn't wanna say anything
against my cousin.

21:05.212 --> 21:07.012
But he's not a drug pusher,
I'll tell you that much.

21:07.047 --> 21:08.280
All right, listen.

21:08.315 --> 21:10.015
This mild-mannered doctor shtick?

21:10.050 --> 21:11.116
You're gonna have to come off it.

21:11.151 --> 21:12.751
What're you...

21:12.786 --> 21:14.920
Because you're connected to two murders.

21:14.955 --> 21:17.022
And you wrote the fraudulent scripts

21:17.057 --> 21:19.024
that killed the daughter of Judge Wells.

21:19.059 --> 21:20.793
I didn't.

21:20.827 --> 21:24.630
And either you or your cousin
shot Vance Williams.

21:24.664 --> 21:26.265
I have no idea who this man is.

21:26.299 --> 21:27.733
Really?

21:27.767 --> 21:29.268
'Cause we found Oxy at his place

21:29.302 --> 21:31.237
from prescriptions that you wrote.

21:32.939 --> 21:36.242
Now, I think your cousin
got you into all this.

21:36.276 --> 21:39.612
If you wanna get out of it, hey...

21:39.646 --> 21:41.080
You gotta give us your cousin.

21:41.114 --> 21:42.214
Wait, I'm not following.

21:42.249 --> 21:44.049
We need you to wear a wire.

21:44.084 --> 21:45.618
Get Barrett to talk about
his opioid dealings.

21:45.652 --> 21:46.619
I'm sorry, I could never do that.

21:46.653 --> 21:47.820
All right, fine.

21:47.854 --> 21:48.821
You'll take the full ride alone.

21:48.855 --> 21:50.289
That's crazy.

21:50.323 --> 21:51.790
Like I said, they stole my
prescription pads.

21:51.825 --> 21:53.292
You really gonna hang onto that?

21:53.326 --> 21:54.994
- I'm telling you the truth.
- We're done here.

21:55.028 --> 21:57.062
Start with how you know Lewis.

21:57.097 --> 21:59.765
I, uh, I met Lewis at a club.

21:59.799 --> 22:02.801
And then one thing led to another.

22:02.836 --> 22:05.304
The age difference didn't deter you?

22:05.338 --> 22:07.740
I guess I still have daddy issues.

22:07.774 --> 22:09.675
You have a prior for solicitation.

22:09.709 --> 22:11.644
Oh, that's not what this is.

22:11.678 --> 22:13.078
- I like him.
- That's great.

22:13.113 --> 22:14.346
What's your relationship
with Frank Barrett?

22:14.381 --> 22:16.849
Um, I only met him a few times.

22:16.883 --> 22:19.418
He's... He's Lewis' cousin.
That's all I know.

22:19.452 --> 22:21.420
How long you been using?

22:21.454 --> 22:25.758
Oh, those are old.

22:25.792 --> 22:27.192
We can help you.

22:27.227 --> 22:29.094
But we need to know
how bad your habit is.

22:29.129 --> 22:30.929
I just take a pill or two a day.

22:30.964 --> 22:32.264
That's it.

22:32.299 --> 22:35.000
Please, I... I don't know anything else.

22:35.035 --> 22:37.102
Andrea, I think you do know something.

22:37.137 --> 22:38.971
And the sooner you tell us
what you know,

22:39.005 --> 22:40.639
the sooner you can go.

22:40.674 --> 22:44.376
Lewis... he was acting strange today.

22:44.411 --> 22:46.178
- Did he say why?
- No.

22:46.212 --> 22:48.814
But when he got the call,
I knew that it was from Frank.

22:48.848 --> 22:50.349
And then Lewis told him that the police

22:50.383 --> 22:51.950
were asking him questions, too.

22:51.985 --> 22:53.118
And then he started freaking out.

22:53.153 --> 22:56.188
And then the cops came.

22:56.222 --> 22:59.291
So Barrett got prescriptions
from Dr. Macy.

22:59.326 --> 23:00.959
Then he gave them to Vance.

23:00.994 --> 23:03.228
Vance got the runners,
distributed the pills.

23:03.263 --> 23:04.897
Barrett sealed himself off.

23:04.931 --> 23:06.231
Now, without Vance,

23:06.266 --> 23:07.800
the only way to Barrett is through Macy.

23:07.834 --> 23:08.967
And he's not talking.

23:09.002 --> 23:10.302
All right, what about Andrea?

23:10.337 --> 23:11.970
Well, we dumped Andrea's phone.

23:12.005 --> 23:13.072
And right now,
there's no obvious connection

23:13.106 --> 23:14.673
to her and Barrett.

23:14.708 --> 23:16.308
What we do know is
she has a serious habit.

23:16.343 --> 23:17.843
She's gonna be sweating
it out in lock-up,

23:17.877 --> 23:19.478
looking for a fix.

23:19.512 --> 23:21.046
That explains the Oxy we
found at Macy's apartment.

23:21.081 --> 23:22.715
Yeah, you know what else we found?

23:22.749 --> 23:24.983
Love notes from the doctor.
Post-It notes.

23:25.018 --> 23:27.419
"Andrea, you're every pleasure
I've ever imagined."

23:27.454 --> 23:28.754
"No matter how much we're together,

23:28.788 --> 23:29.988
I can never get enough of you."

23:30.023 --> 23:31.323
Then that's it. We got him.

23:31.358 --> 23:33.392
- Mmm-hmm.
- The doctor's in love.

23:33.426 --> 23:35.828
And we use her to make him flip.

23:35.862 --> 23:37.162
This is where he's vulnerable.

23:37.197 --> 23:38.831
We squeeze as tight as we can.

23:38.865 --> 23:40.733
Cut Andrea loose. Keep eyes on her.

23:40.767 --> 23:42.167
Find something actionable.

23:51.811 --> 23:54.179
You know, I've been waiting
for your call.

23:54.214 --> 23:56.348
Are you kidding me right now?
You're gonna talk to me here?

23:56.383 --> 23:58.016
You know, according to my timepiece,

23:58.051 --> 24:00.085
you've got about four hours left.

24:00.120 --> 24:01.387
Yeah, well I've been busy.

24:01.421 --> 24:02.921
You plant that seed I gave you?

24:02.956 --> 24:05.124
No, all right?

24:05.158 --> 24:07.226
It's not easy to plant 20K, okay?

24:07.260 --> 24:08.293
There's too many eyes.

24:08.328 --> 24:09.294
Come here.

24:12.999 --> 24:16.869
Ah, remove your glasses
when you talk to me.

24:21.474 --> 24:23.776
Sweet Jesus, he took it, didn't he?

24:23.810 --> 24:25.444
- No, that's not what happened.
- Don't you lie to me.

24:25.478 --> 24:29.148
- I'm not lying to you.
- Then where's the money?

24:29.182 --> 24:31.216
I need more time, all right?

24:31.251 --> 24:32.418
I need more time to plant it.

24:32.452 --> 24:34.052
I'm waiting for another chance.

24:34.087 --> 24:37.823
I think the harpoon
is already in the whale.

24:37.857 --> 24:39.258
Time is ticking.

24:39.292 --> 24:41.393
6:00 p.m. tomorrow,
you bring me the cash,

24:41.428 --> 24:43.896
or proof that Voight took it.

24:43.930 --> 24:45.397
We're done.

25:14.294 --> 25:16.495
No!

25:16.529 --> 25:18.430
Please, please!

25:24.070 --> 25:25.270
- Hey, Jen.
- Hey.

25:25.305 --> 25:26.972
- Hey, thanks for coming.
- Hi.

25:27.006 --> 25:30.375
- Hey, I got you the white wine.
- Thank you.

25:30.410 --> 25:31.844
Glad you called.

25:31.878 --> 25:33.612
I wasn't expecting to hear from you.

25:33.646 --> 25:35.147
Uh, yeah, you know what?

25:35.181 --> 25:36.949
I didn't actually call about that.

25:36.983 --> 25:39.051
Um, I need some advice.

25:39.085 --> 25:40.986
Sure. Are you in trouble?

25:41.020 --> 25:43.021
Well, I've got this friend.

25:43.056 --> 25:44.122
Who's also a cop.

25:44.157 --> 25:46.291
And, uh, his sister got a DUI.

25:46.326 --> 25:47.893
And her son was in the car.

25:47.927 --> 25:49.194
Gonna be a mess.

25:49.229 --> 25:50.462
And my friend, he took care of it.

25:50.497 --> 25:52.464
The problem is, a white shirt...

25:52.499 --> 25:54.166
- he found out about it.
- Mmm-hmm.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.068
And now my friend's getting
all jammed up.

25:56.102 --> 25:57.336
I'm just wondering
what kind of punishment

25:57.370 --> 25:59.137
he might be looking at.

25:59.172 --> 26:01.473
Well, falsifying a report is
a Rule 14 violation.

26:01.508 --> 26:04.042
It's a straight felony.

26:04.077 --> 26:06.011
Plus with a white shirt gunning for him,

26:06.045 --> 26:10.015
I'd say your friend is looking
at five years in prison.

26:10.049 --> 26:11.850
Okay.

26:11.885 --> 26:14.386
Ouch.

26:14.420 --> 26:17.055
It's the new world of reform.

26:17.090 --> 26:18.991
Everybody wants to bury a cop.

26:21.528 --> 26:22.961
Yeah.

26:29.275 --> 26:30.376
We arrested your girlfriend.

26:30.401 --> 26:32.329
She was buying heroin on the west side.

26:32.423 --> 26:34.009
She's been trying to wean herself off.

26:34.052 --> 26:35.486
She just needs to go back to rehab.

26:35.525 --> 26:38.533
Well, you can make that happen
if you start cooperating.

26:40.924 --> 26:42.025
I know what you're trying to do.

26:42.050 --> 26:45.586
Look, your cousin is a drug pusher.

26:45.712 --> 26:47.079
He killed one man we know of,

26:47.113 --> 26:48.781
and he's extorting you.

26:48.815 --> 26:50.950
Now, you can save him,

26:50.984 --> 26:53.446
or you can save her.

26:53.987 --> 26:55.220
When I met Andrea,

26:55.255 --> 26:57.024
that's when I came back to life.

26:57.824 --> 27:01.321
For the first time I was
finally doing something for me.

27:01.840 --> 27:03.218
And then on top of everything else,

27:03.243 --> 27:04.329
I had a divorce to pay for.

27:04.368 --> 27:07.938
Okay, so you reached out
to your cousin Frank, yeah?

27:10.708 --> 27:14.911
Frank always told me
if I ever needed anything...

27:14.946 --> 27:17.681
I couldn't pay the loan back.

27:17.715 --> 27:20.183
That is when he asked
for the prescriptions.

27:20.218 --> 27:21.852
Then I didn't know how to get out.

27:26.057 --> 27:27.457
What about Andrea?

27:27.492 --> 27:30.227
Listen, you give us Frank,

27:30.261 --> 27:32.963
Andrea walks. You have my word.

27:34.765 --> 27:37.367
One day, I'm gonna have this
darn monkey off my back,

27:37.401 --> 27:39.236
and Andrea and I are gonna be together.

27:43.941 --> 27:45.208
This is a transmitting device.

27:45.243 --> 27:46.443
Works like a regular phone.

27:46.477 --> 27:48.078
You can still receive calls.

27:48.112 --> 27:52.782
You press this button twice,
you're ready to rock.

27:52.817 --> 27:55.418
I don't know if I can do this.

27:55.453 --> 27:57.821
Frank is my family.

27:57.855 --> 27:59.222
We grew up together,

27:59.257 --> 28:00.957
and now I'm gonna stab him in the back.

28:00.992 --> 28:04.060
No, no, this isn't who I am.

28:06.197 --> 28:07.330
You know who you are.

28:07.365 --> 28:09.900
You're a guy with no good options.

28:11.035 --> 28:12.369
So you gotta deal with it.

28:13.871 --> 28:16.306
What I did was wrong.
This is also wrong.

28:17.842 --> 28:20.243
Yeah, well, sometimes
two wrongs make a right.

28:24.815 --> 28:26.316
Press this button twice.

28:30.888 --> 28:32.255
Let's go.

28:42.200 --> 28:44.768
Let me know when you got eyes
on the doctor.

28:48.206 --> 28:50.407
Yeah, we got him. He's by the bench.

28:52.476 --> 28:54.044
Got eyes on Barrett, too.

28:54.078 --> 28:55.111
Black jacket, blue jeans.

28:55.146 --> 28:56.379
He's approaching right now.

28:56.414 --> 28:57.781
<i>Copy that.</i>

29:00.017 --> 29:01.184
Huh.

29:04.589 --> 29:07.791
Frank.

29:08.426 --> 29:09.993
Why'd you wanna meet here?

29:10.027 --> 29:11.394
Eh, cops have been poking
around the bar.

29:11.429 --> 29:12.562
<i>So, what's up?</i>

29:12.597 --> 29:14.331
<i>What'd you wanna talk about?</i>

29:14.365 --> 29:15.565
<i>About the cops.</i>

29:15.600 --> 29:17.200
You said nothing was gonna happen.

29:17.235 --> 29:19.002
Nothing has happened.

29:19.036 --> 29:20.237
Let's go take a walk.

29:20.271 --> 29:21.471
- Where?
- Eh, we'll just walk.

29:21.505 --> 29:22.505
Come on.

29:23.841 --> 29:24.808
All right, they're on the move.

29:24.842 --> 29:26.142
Southeast.

29:26.177 --> 29:27.911
So, what do you really want, Lewis?

29:27.945 --> 29:29.412
Look, I'm scared
they're going to find out.

29:29.447 --> 29:31.047
About what?

29:31.082 --> 29:33.583
About the Oxy pills.

29:33.618 --> 29:35.385
What are you talking about, huh?

29:35.419 --> 29:37.921
There's no way that they can
connect anything to us.

29:37.955 --> 29:39.889
It's perfect.

29:39.924 --> 29:43.426
Look, all you gotta do
is stick to the story.

29:43.461 --> 29:44.594
What about Vance?

29:46.931 --> 29:49.232
I don't know what you're talking about.

29:49.267 --> 29:50.433
Come on.

29:56.207 --> 29:58.341
All right, hey, we got eyes.

29:58.376 --> 30:00.277
I want you to hang back.
We don't wanna heat this guy.

30:00.311 --> 30:01.611
Copy.

30:01.646 --> 30:03.847
You know, that's strange, Lewis.

30:03.881 --> 30:05.248
That person you're referring to,

30:05.283 --> 30:07.550
I don't remember telling you his name.

30:07.585 --> 30:09.252
The police told me about Vance.

30:09.287 --> 30:10.453
The police, huh?

30:10.488 --> 30:12.022
How many times you talk to them?

30:12.056 --> 30:13.390
Once, twice.

30:13.424 --> 30:15.458
Well, which one is it? Once or twice?

30:15.493 --> 30:19.396
It doesn't matter. Why did you kill him?

30:19.430 --> 30:21.231
Why are you trying to get me
to admit to something

30:21.265 --> 30:22.432
I didn't do?

30:22.466 --> 30:23.900
- I just wanna know.
- Huh?

30:23.934 --> 30:24.968
What, did they put a wire on you?

30:25.002 --> 30:25.969
- No.
- You got a wire?

30:26.003 --> 30:28.138
No, God, no.

30:28.172 --> 30:29.139
We can pull him out.

30:29.173 --> 30:31.141
Wait for my order.

30:31.175 --> 30:33.143
Did the cops flip you, Lewis?

30:33.177 --> 30:36.379
No, it's not like that.

30:37.448 --> 30:40.150
Frank. Frank!

30:40.184 --> 30:42.085
- Frank!
- They're going in the tunnel.

30:43.688 --> 30:46.623
<i>- Frank!
- Hey, listen to me.</i>

30:46.657 --> 30:48.925
<i>I don't care that we're family.</i>

30:48.959 --> 30:50.393
<i>If you ever say anything to the cops...</i>

30:50.428 --> 30:52.095
<i>Frank, what the hell are you doing?</i>

30:52.129 --> 30:53.997
<i>I will shove this gun
so far down your...</i>

30:54.031 --> 30:54.998
Move in, now.

31:06.110 --> 31:07.911
All right, go, man. Go, go, go.

31:07.945 --> 31:09.946
Sarge, Macy's down, but we got him.

31:09.980 --> 31:11.948
Barrett fled out the west side
of the tunnel.

31:11.982 --> 31:13.249
Atwater and Upton are in pursuit.

31:13.284 --> 31:15.518
I do not believe that they have eyes.

31:15.553 --> 31:17.253
I got eyes on Barrett.

31:17.288 --> 31:20.023
He's at the south end of the park.

31:20.057 --> 31:21.291
You guys, there's a lot of kids around.

31:21.325 --> 31:22.992
Barrett is armed.

31:23.027 --> 31:24.527
There's too many civilians
to take any chances.

31:24.562 --> 31:27.664
Apprehend without incident.

31:27.698 --> 31:31.634
Hey, is that a zebra? Okay, great.

31:31.669 --> 31:34.170
He's getting on the bus. The 289.

31:36.340 --> 31:38.942
Sorry. How's it going?

31:41.379 --> 31:42.946
Thanks.

32:46.544 --> 32:48.745
Nice and easy, Frank.

32:57.335 --> 32:58.921
Well, thanks to your cousin,

32:59.006 --> 33:00.736
we got you on drug trafficking,

33:00.771 --> 33:03.693
narcotics induced homicide
of Julianne Wells,

33:03.756 --> 33:04.941
and now the murder...

33:04.980 --> 33:06.709
or attempted murder... of your cousin.

33:06.734 --> 33:08.185
Ah, come on.

33:08.216 --> 33:10.314
The idiot grabbed the gun
and it went off.

33:10.386 --> 33:11.838
I wasn't gonna shoot him.

33:12.123 --> 33:14.123
Anything else you wanna say
in your defense?

33:14.169 --> 33:16.356
You know what? I think I'll
let my lawyer handle that.

33:16.414 --> 33:18.182
This is murder, bro.

33:19.815 --> 33:21.431
Vance was your middle man.

33:21.456 --> 33:23.257
You found out he was gonna roll.

33:23.291 --> 33:25.326
You killed him, too.

33:25.402 --> 33:27.437
Look, I may have had
something to do with the pills.

33:27.471 --> 33:29.872
But I had nothing to do
with that guy's murder.

33:29.907 --> 33:32.275
We know Vance set a meeting with you.

33:32.309 --> 33:36.078
And we got your shoeprint at the scene.

33:37.047 --> 33:38.181
Size 11.

33:41.084 --> 33:43.052
Yeah, I do have a size 11.

33:43.086 --> 33:45.888
But I also have an alibi for
the night that guy was killed.

33:45.923 --> 33:48.991
And we checked it.
You left Blazes at seven.

33:49.026 --> 33:51.894
That's plenty of time to do this murder.

33:53.263 --> 33:55.198
Okay, look.

33:55.232 --> 33:57.900
I lied about being there all night.

33:57.935 --> 34:00.136
It's because I was meeting a doctor.

34:00.170 --> 34:01.137
His name is Furlow.

34:01.171 --> 34:02.805
Dr. Daniel Furlow.

34:02.840 --> 34:04.340
I was seeing if he might
wanna be in business.

34:04.374 --> 34:06.142
It's not exactly something
I wanted to advertise.

34:06.176 --> 34:08.511
Do you understand?

34:08.545 --> 34:10.346
Where was this?

34:10.380 --> 34:11.547
It was at the Ambassador Hotel.

34:11.581 --> 34:12.915
And you can check that.

34:15.953 --> 34:17.553
What else did you lie about?

34:34.605 --> 34:35.838
So, what have you got for me?

34:38.641 --> 34:42.011
You know, I've thought a lot
about this situation.

34:42.045 --> 34:43.446
I've gone over all the math,

34:43.480 --> 34:44.880
all the possibilities.

34:44.915 --> 34:48.083
And I think I came to a conclusion.

34:48.118 --> 34:49.952
Screw you.

34:49.987 --> 34:51.920
Oh, that feels good.

34:51.955 --> 34:54.456
Yeah, screw you.

34:54.491 --> 34:56.125
You know, you must be lousy at math,

34:56.159 --> 34:57.527
because you got the exact wrong answer.

34:57.561 --> 34:59.128
Yeah, well, you know what?

34:59.162 --> 35:00.196
It's the only one I can live with, so...

35:00.230 --> 35:01.464
And what about your family?

35:01.498 --> 35:03.366
Voight is my family.

35:03.400 --> 35:05.568
That's what you don't
seem to understand.

35:05.602 --> 35:07.436
They're all my family.

35:07.471 --> 35:09.472
And I'm not gonna give them up
for the likes of you.

35:09.506 --> 35:11.307
Not a bridge you wanna burn, son.

35:11.341 --> 35:14.977
No, it is a bridge that
I wanna blow the hell up.

35:15.012 --> 35:17.046
You with all your high-minded BS.

35:17.080 --> 35:18.147
Your superiority.

35:18.181 --> 35:19.982
Oh, my God.

35:20.017 --> 35:23.319
I mean, the only reason that
you wanna get Voight so bad

35:23.353 --> 35:25.988
is because you realize
you're not half the man he is.

35:26.023 --> 35:30.159
And I'm here to tell you
you never will be.

35:30.193 --> 35:33.162
Officer Ruzek...

35:33.196 --> 35:36.966
Enjoy your last day as a cop.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.534
I will.

35:53.050 --> 35:54.650
Hey, sorry for the late hour.

35:54.685 --> 35:56.319
Eh, it's all right.

35:56.353 --> 35:57.620
I haven't been sleeping.

35:57.654 --> 36:01.490
Oh, well, I do have some good news.

36:01.525 --> 36:02.558
Yeah?

36:04.394 --> 36:07.296
Busted Frank Barrett.

36:07.331 --> 36:10.099
ASA's charging him
with the drug induced homicide

36:10.133 --> 36:11.467
of Julianne.

36:13.003 --> 36:14.270
Thank you, Hank.

36:15.973 --> 36:18.040
There's some cold comfort in that.

36:18.075 --> 36:20.443
I'm glad. Look at this.

36:20.477 --> 36:22.244
Oh, my God.

36:24.081 --> 36:26.482
You remember that time we
chased those robbery suspects

36:26.516 --> 36:28.017
across Wabash, trapped them under

36:28.051 --> 36:29.318
the El tracks?

36:29.353 --> 36:31.020
Yeah, the inspector wrote me up

36:31.054 --> 36:33.990
for not wearing my crown cap.

36:35.425 --> 36:37.159
You still got your service revolver?

36:37.194 --> 36:39.228
Uh, no, no.

36:39.262 --> 36:41.297
- I lost it.
- Lost it?

36:41.331 --> 36:44.300
- Yeah.
- Just disappeared, huh?

36:44.334 --> 36:48.070
Well, you know, it got put into a box,

36:48.105 --> 36:49.472
and then one day it was gone.

36:51.174 --> 36:52.642
Huh.

36:52.676 --> 36:54.310
Well, that's too bad.

36:55.445 --> 36:58.981
They had that special ammo
for those 357s, remember?

37:00.450 --> 37:03.986
- It was a long time ago.
- Yeah, well...

37:04.021 --> 37:07.256
The reason I think of it is we
just got the ballistics back.

37:09.626 --> 37:13.095
Vance Williams was killed with
a .38 caliber hollow-point.

37:15.032 --> 37:17.767
The same ammo we used
in our service revolvers.

37:19.636 --> 37:21.170
And the thing is...

37:23.740 --> 37:27.376
Only cops got those bullets.

37:27.411 --> 37:30.713
And they stopped making them in 1994.

37:30.747 --> 37:34.016
Which is the same year you
stopped being a policeman.

37:40.090 --> 37:41.791
You about a size 11, Tommy.

37:44.594 --> 37:47.763
I'm not sure what
you're getting at, Hank.

37:47.798 --> 37:51.734
You told me that Barrett
was good for the murder.

37:51.768 --> 37:55.304
Yeah, well, I thought he was, but...

37:55.338 --> 37:58.641
His alibi checked out.

37:58.675 --> 37:59.775
He wasn't there.

38:04.448 --> 38:05.614
Tommy.

38:07.417 --> 38:09.585
Tommy, I knew you when you were a cop.

38:12.456 --> 38:15.558
I know what you're capable of.

38:15.592 --> 38:17.793
And I know what it's like
to look into the eyes

38:17.828 --> 38:19.662
of the person that killed your child.

38:26.169 --> 38:29.071
If you look really closely, Hank,

38:29.106 --> 38:31.774
I think you'll see

38:31.808 --> 38:33.743
that there's no physical
evidence to tie me

38:33.777 --> 38:37.246
to this murder.

38:37.280 --> 38:40.349
And even if you try to make a case,

38:40.383 --> 38:44.687
I've been a judge and a cop
in this town for 30 years.

38:44.721 --> 38:46.689
All the friends that I've made?

38:48.825 --> 38:50.126
It's an army.

38:51.695 --> 38:54.263
Tommy, I'm just saying
I know what happened.

38:56.299 --> 38:57.533
I know.

39:00.570 --> 39:03.272
Doesn't feel as good as you
think it will, does it?

39:18.555 --> 39:19.855
I need something.

39:22.893 --> 39:24.193
I'm listening.

39:40.777 --> 39:42.545
Hey, man.

39:44.447 --> 39:48.584
I gotta go meet a C.I.

39:48.618 --> 39:50.486
I could use the back up.

39:51.788 --> 39:53.823
You want me to call in Atwater?

39:55.258 --> 39:57.426
No, you and me.

39:57.460 --> 39:59.495
Just like the old days.

39:59.529 --> 40:01.564
All right, yeah.

40:01.598 --> 40:04.400
- I like that.
- Yeah.

40:05.402 --> 40:07.903
Remember the first time we met?

40:07.938 --> 40:10.506
- At the Academy?
- That's right.

40:10.540 --> 40:11.740
You were on top of your instructor.

40:13.310 --> 40:14.610
It was a hostage drill.

40:14.644 --> 40:16.178
We were supposed to disarm him.

40:16.213 --> 40:19.515
Yeah, you beat him up.

40:19.549 --> 40:21.383
I disarmed him.

40:24.654 --> 40:26.922
You know, you've always been
like a son to me.

40:33.563 --> 40:36.465
I thought we were going
to the south side.

40:36.499 --> 40:38.467
Yeah, we just changed the venue.

41:10.867 --> 41:12.735
That's the C.I.

41:12.769 --> 41:14.336
Yeah.

41:16.640 --> 41:17.840
Come on.

41:37.027 --> 41:38.794
Who are we meeting, Al?

41:45.835 --> 41:47.436
Al.
