01:17.177 --> 01:19.123
Are you awake?

01:20.113 --> 01:21.353
No.

01:22.549 --> 01:24.551
What time is it?

01:24.718 --> 01:26.197
Two o'clock.

01:26.353 --> 01:28.526
Almost two o'clock.

01:29.022 --> 01:31.229
AM or PM?

01:32.859 --> 01:35.066
You're not serious.

01:36.296 --> 01:37.639
Not entirely.

01:39.866 --> 01:42.210
It's afternoon.

01:42.369 --> 01:43.712
I know.

01:44.538 --> 01:45.983
What time
is your flight?

01:46.139 --> 01:48.050
7:40 to Amsterdam.

01:48.208 --> 01:49.949
I haven't seen
you for two weeks,

01:50.043 --> 01:52.717
and you're leaving
again this evening?

01:52.879 --> 01:56.383
I know. I'll be
gone for just a few days.

01:56.750 --> 01:59.162
God, you're a sexy woman.

02:00.387 --> 02:02.333
What are you doing?

02:02.489 --> 02:03.832
I'm not doing anything.

02:03.991 --> 02:07.165
They're going to take
me out of here on a gurney.

02:12.065 --> 02:14.341
Tell me something sexy.

02:18.005 --> 02:21.350
I want you to put
your hand up my dress.

02:22.009 --> 02:23.818
But you're not wearing a dress.

02:25.345 --> 02:27.586
What does that
have to do with it?

02:28.915 --> 02:31.589
It's something you
like for me to say.

02:32.285 --> 02:36.131
I know. But it has to
be real, doesn't it?

02:38.759 --> 02:42.104
Why don't you just tell me what it
is that you want me to do to you?

02:44.531 --> 02:46.704
I want you to touch me.

02:47.601 --> 02:49.774
You want me to touch you where?

02:51.605 --> 02:53.949
I want you to
touch me down there.

02:55.375 --> 02:56.945
You do?

02:58.311 --> 02:59.984
I really do.

03:02.549 --> 03:04.790
Say it more sexy.

03:08.522 --> 03:11.332
I want you to touch me.

03:15.128 --> 03:16.664
Are you wet?

03:16.730 --> 03:17.834
Yes.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.878
You really are.
Yes.

03:20.567 --> 03:23.138
God, you're sopping.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.706
I know.

03:28.575 --> 03:31.488
How did you get yourself
into such a state?

03:35.348 --> 03:37.692
From thinking about you.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.832
From thinking about me, what?

03:41.188 --> 03:45.159
From thinking about your
sweet face between my legs.

03:57.504 --> 03:59.108
Wait, wait, wait.

03:59.272 --> 04:03.277
I think I should go tidy up.

04:03.443 --> 04:05.218
I don't want you to.

04:11.284 --> 04:14.857
Slow, slow, slow.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.706
How do you know how to do that?

04:25.432 --> 04:28.140
From hanging out
with really nasty girls.

04:36.543 --> 04:39.046
You've ruined me,
you know that?

04:39.813 --> 04:41.224
I hope so.

04:44.417 --> 04:48.627
God, you have the most luscious
pussy in all of Christendom.

04:48.722 --> 04:49.928
Did you know that?

04:58.965 --> 05:00.808
Tell me what to do.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.308
You know what to do.

05:07.407 --> 05:08.442
Tell me.

05:09.943 --> 05:11.354
What if I shock you?

05:12.279 --> 05:13.587
Too bad.

05:15.182 --> 05:17.594
I want you to
finger-fuck me.

05:19.186 --> 05:20.358
What?

05:21.588 --> 05:23.192
You heard me.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.163
I can't believe you said that

05:26.259 --> 05:27.636
Believe it.

05:36.169 --> 05:40.311
You're reached a whole new level
of depravity, haven't you?

05:44.344 --> 05:46.993
I thought it didn't mean
that much to girls.

05:48.381 --> 05:50.292
Depends on the girl.

05:53.520 --> 05:56.399
I want you to stick
your finger up me,

05:56.523 --> 05:59.402
and find my spot,
and push on it.

06:08.168 --> 06:09.476
Oh, my God!

06:21.982 --> 06:23.893
God, you are luscious.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.769
Oh, my God!

10:32.132 --> 10:33.406
Illegals!

10:33.733 --> 10:35.735
Welcome to the Untied States.

11:07.033 --> 11:09.234
Do you like it because it
reminds you of somewhere else?

11:09.869 --> 11:11.610
That's not why I like it.

11:12.272 --> 11:13.774
I like it for itself.

11:13.940 --> 11:16.045
It doesn't have
to be like something else.

11:16.543 --> 11:17.886
No.

11:18.044 --> 11:20.524
Do I remind you
of someone else?

11:21.514 --> 11:23.118
Yes, you do.

11:23.283 --> 11:24.887
Someone you miss?

11:26.786 --> 11:29.130
Someone who is dead.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.295
I don't think I miss things.

11:34.127 --> 11:37.301
I think to miss something is to
hope that it will come back.

11:37.797 --> 11:39.572
But it's not coming back.

11:40.800 --> 11:44.213
I've always known that
since I was a girl.

11:46.306 --> 11:47.808
You don't think
that's a bit cold?

11:50.410 --> 11:52.481
I think truth
has no temperature.

11:59.085 --> 12:00.086
Mmm.

12:04.657 --> 12:05.761
There it goes.

12:41.861 --> 12:43.863
Follow me, please.

12:56.142 --> 12:57.644
Good morning.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.784
I want her to have
something that

13:00.880 --> 13:03.622
she won't be
uncomfortable wearing.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.262
I don't want to give her
a diamond so big,

13:05.318 --> 13:06.888
she'd be afraid to wear it.

13:07.253 --> 13:11.133
She is probably more
courageous than you imagine.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.107
Is this a pillow?

13:17.263 --> 13:18.606
No, it's an Asscher.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.335
Look at the corners.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.136
Let's put it in
the grading box.

13:25.071 --> 13:28.280
The pillow has a slight arc
to the sides.

13:28.441 --> 13:31.615
It is a modern version
of the old-mine cut.

13:31.778 --> 13:33.348
Let's look at the color.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.254
Put it table-side down.

13:35.415 --> 13:36.951
So you're looking
through the pavilion?

13:37.116 --> 13:39.460
Yes,
there's more to look through.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.772
It appears to be yellow.

13:48.928 --> 13:51.101
It's nitrogen that
gives it the yellow.

13:51.264 --> 13:55.178
The colors start with D.
A D-stone has no color.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.381
So, what am I looking at?

13:59.539 --> 14:01.280
H.

14:01.441 --> 14:02.545
Is that still a good color?

14:02.709 --> 14:04.552
That's a very good color.

14:04.711 --> 14:06.850
The truth is that
anything you can say

14:06.946 --> 14:09.392
about the diamond is
in the nature of a flaw.

14:09.549 --> 14:13.622
A perfect diamond would be
composed simply of light.

14:14.554 --> 14:17.194
Do you see the inclusion?

14:18.658 --> 14:19.693
No.

14:19.992 --> 14:23.132
It is small,
what we would call a feather.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.568
Yes.

14:27.166 --> 14:28.304
I think I see it.

14:30.670 --> 14:32.013
So, it is graded what?

14:32.171 --> 14:33.514
A VS1.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.812
Some might grade it higher.

14:36.309 --> 14:38.311
You might grade it higher.

14:41.547 --> 14:42.651
You like this stone?

14:42.815 --> 14:43.816
Oh.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.556
I like that stone.

14:51.557 --> 14:52.729
How many carats is it?

14:52.892 --> 14:54.064
3.9.

14:54.193 --> 14:55.194
It's expensive.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.915
Tell me what you see.

15:08.007 --> 15:10.578
Remember,
you're not looking for merit.

15:10.676 --> 15:12.053
This is a cynical business.

15:12.111 --> 15:14.591
We seek only imperfection.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.952
This is a 5-carat stone.

15:19.018 --> 15:21.020
Tell me what you see.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.399
The culet seems big.

15:28.060 --> 15:30.904
Crown and pavilion don't fit.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.141
The girdle comes out crooked.

15:33.232 --> 15:34.802
Very good.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.215
But there is no
perfect diamond.

15:41.607 --> 15:45.817
<i>"En este mundo nada es perfecto",</i>
as my father would say.

15:46.879 --> 15:47.880
You're Sephardic.

15:47.947 --> 15:48.948
Yes.

15:49.916 --> 15:51.327
Do you know Spain?

15:51.451 --> 15:52.828
I do.

15:52.919 --> 15:54.057
And Spain me.

15:55.221 --> 15:57.599
At one time, I thought she
would return from the grave,

15:57.657 --> 15:59.933
but that is not to be.

16:01.093 --> 16:05.564
Every country that has driven out the
Jews has suffered the same fate.

16:06.332 --> 16:07.743
Which is?

16:09.469 --> 16:11.642
You don't want to hear.

16:11.737 --> 16:13.808
We should talk stones.

16:13.906 --> 16:16.318
The most valued stone
is the red diamond

16:16.409 --> 16:19.856
from the Argyle Mines,
so very rare.

16:19.946 --> 16:24.292
I've seen two in a long life.
A prize almost beyond belief.

16:27.153 --> 16:28.257
I do want to hear.

16:35.194 --> 16:39.301
Well, I have to say,

16:41.434 --> 16:44.608
there's no culture, save for
the Semitic culture, there.

16:46.606 --> 16:49.519
The last known culture
before that was the Greek,

16:49.609 --> 16:53.489
and there will be no
culture after, nothing.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.460
That's a bold claim.

16:56.516 --> 17:00.521
The heart of any culture is to be
found in the nature of the hero.

17:00.620 --> 17:03.362
Who is that man who is revered?

17:04.624 --> 17:06.694
In the classical world,
it is the warrior,

17:06.791 --> 17:10.467
but in the Western world,
it is the man of God.

17:11.329 --> 17:15.675
From Moses to Christ,
the Prophet, the Penitent.

17:17.002 --> 17:22.544
Such a figure was unknown to the
Greeks, unheard of, unimaginable.

17:24.310 --> 17:28.554
Because there is only a man
of God, not a man of gods.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.726
And this God is the God
of the Jewish people.

17:31.817 --> 17:33.091
There is no other God.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.867
We see him...
What is the word?

17:37.557 --> 17:38.831
Purloined.

17:40.993 --> 17:43.200
Purloined in the West.

17:44.730 --> 17:47.677
How do you steal a God?

17:49.869 --> 17:52.577
The Jew beholds
his tormentor dressed

17:52.672 --> 17:56.711
in the vestments
of his own ancient culture.

17:56.776 --> 17:59.780
Everything bears
a strange familiarity.

18:01.714 --> 18:06.424
The fit is always poor, and the
hands are always dripping blood.

18:09.855 --> 18:15.464
That coat? Didn't that
belong to Uncle Haim?

18:15.561 --> 18:17.802
What about the shoes?

18:21.300 --> 18:25.214
Enough. I see your look.
No more philosophy.

18:33.813 --> 18:37.727
The stones themselves
have their own view of things.

18:39.385 --> 18:42.594
Perhaps they are not
so silent as you think.

18:42.655 --> 18:45.465
They were piped
up out of the earth

18:45.591 --> 18:48.401
in a time before
any witness was.

18:51.297 --> 18:52.742
But here they are.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.443
Let me show you.

19:00.573 --> 19:03.247
This is a cautionary stone.

19:05.444 --> 19:09.290
Although, I suppose
every diamond is cautionary.

19:10.783 --> 19:12.694
A cautionary diamond.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.092
Of course, why not?

19:15.755 --> 19:18.929
It's not a small thing to wish
for, however unattainable...

19:19.091 --> 19:22.129
to aspire to
the stone's endless destiny.

19:22.628 --> 19:25.131
Isn't that the meaning
of adornment?

19:25.297 --> 19:28.278
To enhance the beauty
of the beloved...

19:28.434 --> 19:30.471
is to acknowledge
both her frailty,

19:30.603 --> 19:33.607
and the nobility
of that frailty.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.047
We announce to the darkness...

19:35.207 --> 19:39.212
that we will not be diminished
by the brevity of our lives.

19:40.980 --> 19:45.451
That we will not
thereby be made less.

19:46.285 --> 19:48.128
You will see.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.978
Afternoon, sir.
Thank you.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.153
Looking good, Counselor.
Chris.

20:10.309 --> 20:11.344
How you doing?

20:11.477 --> 20:12.512
Good.

20:23.556 --> 20:24.660
Where's Reiner?

20:25.324 --> 20:26.325
He's in there.

20:39.271 --> 20:40.551
You don't have
to worry about it.

20:40.673 --> 20:41.713
Yeah, but who paid for it?

20:41.841 --> 20:44.720
I put the credit card down.
So, obviously, I paid for it.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.413
You paid for it?
I don't care.

20:46.579 --> 20:47.683
But you like it?

20:47.847 --> 20:49.758
I do like it.

20:49.915 --> 20:53.089
I've never been to Barbados.
Are all the ladies as sexy as you?

20:53.686 --> 20:55.791
It's a steaming pit
of sexual abandon.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.094
I don't believe you.

20:58.257 --> 21:01.363
Well, it used to be.
I left.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.200
Come in.

21:09.902 --> 21:11.939
Good morning, Counselor.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.607
Good morning.
Malkina.

21:15.374 --> 21:16.478
<i>Hola, guapo.</i>

21:16.609 --> 21:17.747
Hey.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.254
How's Laura?
Incredible.

21:21.413 --> 21:23.051
That sounds about right.

21:23.215 --> 21:25.092
Nice lady, nice lady.

21:25.618 --> 21:28.462
I assume that she's not privy to
your newest business venture.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.658
She's not.
And your lady?

21:30.756 --> 21:31.894
Uh...

21:32.424 --> 21:33.562
Yeah.

21:35.461 --> 21:36.462
"Yeah," what?

21:36.796 --> 21:39.743
I don't know what she knows.
I don't want to know.

21:40.833 --> 21:41.811
You don't trust her?

21:41.901 --> 21:43.938
Jesus, Counselor.
She's a woman.

21:44.103 --> 21:45.810
I don't mean to
sound that cold.

21:45.971 --> 21:50.920
I just mean that, where men are
concerned, they've got their own agenda.

21:51.076 --> 21:54.489
I always liked smart women. But it's
been an expensive hobby, you know?

21:54.647 --> 21:55.819
Yeah.

21:57.416 --> 21:59.418
Do you know what all that stuff is?
Uh...

21:59.752 --> 22:01.356
Mostly, yeah.

22:02.588 --> 22:05.762
Anything I don't know, I can ask her.
Which worries me even more.

22:05.825 --> 22:06.963
Hmm.

22:08.427 --> 22:09.770
You never told me what happened

22:09.862 --> 22:11.205
with you and
the lovely Clarissa.

22:11.363 --> 22:14.776
Ms. Clarissa of
the extraordinary body.

22:15.634 --> 22:18.171
She used to go
around with no bra.

22:18.270 --> 22:21.308
Those firm nipples in
her blouse or T-shirt.

22:23.142 --> 22:27.386
I think in the end,
it was jealousy that undid us.

22:27.479 --> 22:28.480
Jealousy?

22:28.614 --> 22:30.334
Yeah, she was getting
more pussy than I was.

22:31.283 --> 22:33.126
Is that true?

22:33.285 --> 22:35.822
I think so.
Probably, yeah.

22:37.790 --> 22:40.862
I have to say that for
a girl who liked girls,

22:40.960 --> 22:43.634
she took an extraordinary
interest in the male member.

22:43.696 --> 22:48.167
She sucked on it so hard it
finally corrected my vision.

22:51.804 --> 22:54.717
She left me for this
good-looking black woman.

22:54.807 --> 22:55.877
Whoo.

22:55.975 --> 23:01.550
Had a boyfriend. Played for the
Oilers. Nice chap. Nice chap.

23:01.647 --> 23:03.854
We met once for drinks
at this club in Dallas

23:03.916 --> 23:05.589
to discuss our mutual plight.

23:05.684 --> 23:09.188
He was taking it rather
poorly, I have to say.

23:09.255 --> 23:10.757
Women do better, don't they?

23:11.724 --> 23:13.226
Maybe they have
more practice at it.

23:13.559 --> 23:16.369
Yeah, well, my guess
is that in most cases,

23:16.428 --> 23:19.102
if you still have the woman
you're weeping over,

23:19.198 --> 23:21.337
you'll be weeping harder.
Mm-hmm.

23:24.837 --> 23:27.078
So, is this place secure?

23:27.239 --> 23:28.240
Who knows?

23:28.340 --> 23:30.752
I don't speak in arraignable
phrases anywhere.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.413
There's a scrambler on
the phone, but still,

23:33.545 --> 23:36.025
there's a lot of
smart people out there.

23:36.181 --> 23:40.391
Of course, anybody who
thinks he's the smartest...

23:40.552 --> 23:41.895
is on his way to the slam.

23:42.521 --> 23:43.591
Would that be me?

23:43.722 --> 23:44.860
No, no.

23:45.024 --> 23:47.368
Although, I have to
say that I always thought

23:47.526 --> 23:49.904
a law degree was
a license to steal...

23:50.062 --> 23:53.100
and that you, for one, hadn't
really capitalized on it.

23:53.265 --> 23:56.109
You're not the straight dude
people think though, are you?

23:56.268 --> 23:57.269
I guess not.

23:57.369 --> 24:00.111
I don't mean the caper, I mean you.
Women like you.

24:00.706 --> 24:01.650
All right.

24:01.740 --> 24:03.913
Do you know what
they like about you?

24:04.410 --> 24:05.411
I'm a good fuck?

24:06.078 --> 24:07.079
Right!

24:07.413 --> 24:10.883
No, they can sniff out
the moral dilemma.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.586
The paradox.

24:12.818 --> 24:14.092
"Moral dilemma."

24:14.253 --> 24:16.426
Yeah, they're drawn to it.
Not sure why.

24:16.588 --> 24:19.660
Maybe it's just that lacking
any moral sense themselves...

24:19.825 --> 24:22.237
they're fascinated
by it in men.

24:22.394 --> 24:24.670
Men are attracted to flawed
women, too, of course...

24:24.830 --> 24:26.810
but their illusion
is that they can fix them.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.309
Women don't want
to fix anything.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.346
They only want
to be entertained.

24:30.502 --> 24:31.981
The truth about
women is you can

24:32.071 --> 24:34.017
do anything to them
except bore them.

24:34.907 --> 24:36.113
Well...

24:36.976 --> 24:39.354
there's nothing about Laura
that I would want to fix.

24:39.578 --> 24:40.955
Maybe not.

24:41.113 --> 24:42.593
Do you think she knows
things about me

24:42.748 --> 24:44.159
that I don't know about myself?

24:44.316 --> 24:47.525
Jesus, Counselor, I'm not even sure
what sort of question that is.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.458
Yeah.

24:52.091 --> 24:53.536
Okay.

25:00.199 --> 25:03.339
If you pursue this road
that you've embarked upon...

25:04.636 --> 25:06.513
you will eventually
come to moral decisions

25:06.605 --> 25:09.609
that will take you
completely by surprise.

25:09.875 --> 25:11.354
You won't see it coming at all.

25:13.112 --> 25:15.388
I don't intend
to take this up as a trade.

25:15.547 --> 25:17.959
Yeah, one-time deal, right?

25:18.117 --> 25:19.528
Which you've heard
a thousand times.

25:19.685 --> 25:21.995
No, but a few.

25:22.154 --> 25:25.533
What usually happens is that
after a couple of deals...

25:25.691 --> 25:28.831
they know more than you do and they
set up shop across the street.

25:28.994 --> 25:30.200
And how does that
work out for them?

25:30.362 --> 25:32.171
Not well.

25:32.331 --> 25:33.969
So, that would
be a moral issue.

25:34.133 --> 25:35.737
Not for me.

25:35.901 --> 25:37.539
Or for your associates.

25:38.404 --> 25:39.678
Yeah, well...

25:41.140 --> 25:44.087
They have a real aversion to
mixing business with pleasure.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.752
Do you know what a bolito is?

25:49.681 --> 25:50.819
No.

25:50.983 --> 25:53.589
A bolo is one of those
skinny neckties...

25:53.752 --> 25:56.255
or one of those things
you throw in Argentina.

25:56.422 --> 25:58.163
Yeah, right.

25:58.323 --> 26:02.499
No. In this case,
it's a mechanical device...

26:02.928 --> 26:05.204
and it has this
small electric motor...

26:05.364 --> 26:07.105
with this rather
incredible compound gear

26:07.199 --> 26:08.906
that retrieves a steel cable.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.069
Battery-driven.

26:10.235 --> 26:12.841
And the cable is made
out of some unholy alloy

26:12.905 --> 26:14.350
almost impossible to cut it.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.079
And it's in a loop.

26:16.542 --> 26:20.354
And you come up behind the guy
and you drop it over his head...

26:20.913 --> 26:23.291
and you pull the free end of
the cable tight and walk away.

26:23.449 --> 26:24.621
No one ever even sees you.

26:25.017 --> 26:26.690
And pulling the cable
activates the motor

26:26.852 --> 26:28.525
and the noose
starts to tighten...

26:28.687 --> 26:32.032
and it continues to tighten
until it goes to zero.

26:32.191 --> 26:33.363
It cuts the guy's head off.

26:33.525 --> 26:35.630
Yeah, well, it can.

26:35.794 --> 26:36.864
There's nothing he can do.

26:37.029 --> 26:38.064
No.

26:39.298 --> 26:40.436
Jesus.

26:42.367 --> 26:43.539
Yeah.

26:45.037 --> 26:46.038
How long does it take?

26:46.371 --> 26:47.475
Oh...

26:48.373 --> 26:49.977
Three, four minutes,
five maybe.

26:50.109 --> 26:51.713
It depends on your collar size.

26:52.578 --> 26:53.716
You're shitting me.

26:53.879 --> 26:54.880
No, no, no.

26:55.047 --> 26:56.890
It's just that
there's no easy way

26:56.949 --> 26:59.395
to turn the thing off,
or reason to.

26:59.551 --> 27:02.896
It just keeps running until the
noose closes completely and then...

27:03.055 --> 27:04.090
it self-destructs.

27:04.256 --> 27:07.430
Actually, you're probably dead
in less than a minute.

27:07.893 --> 27:09.338
From strangulation?

27:09.495 --> 27:10.838
No.

27:11.997 --> 27:15.501
The wire cuts through
the carotid arteries...

27:15.667 --> 27:18.147
and then sprays blood
all over the spectators...

27:18.303 --> 27:19.611
and everybody goes home.

27:20.572 --> 27:21.812
Sweet.

27:21.974 --> 27:24.511
Yeah, sweet.

27:24.676 --> 27:26.747
Think about it, Counselor.

27:27.913 --> 27:29.654
So where does all this
beheading shit come from?

27:29.748 --> 27:31.284
You never used to see that.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.921
I think it's blown
in here from the East.

27:34.319 --> 27:35.320
Meaning the East?

27:35.420 --> 27:36.364
Yeah.

27:36.455 --> 27:38.833
You put nine Mexicans
and an Arab in a room,

27:38.924 --> 27:41.632
and give them each $100,
and come back in a few hours,

27:41.693 --> 27:43.534
who do you think is gonna
be holding the grand?

27:46.431 --> 27:48.672
So you gearing up to do business
with them down the road?

27:48.767 --> 27:49.939
The Arabs?
Yeah.

27:50.002 --> 27:51.538
No, no.

27:51.637 --> 27:53.446
Why's that?

27:53.505 --> 27:55.985
Because they don't
need your money.

28:57.402 --> 28:59.575
Do you have a dog?

28:59.671 --> 29:02.550
Do I have a dog?
Yes.

29:02.608 --> 29:04.246
No, ma'am.
Oh.

29:05.110 --> 29:06.248
I don't have a dog.

29:06.378 --> 29:07.550
Okay.

29:09.681 --> 29:11.024
These are for me.

29:11.183 --> 29:12.457
For you?

29:12.551 --> 29:14.929
Yes, ma'am.
It's a diet.

29:15.020 --> 29:16.431
A diet?

29:16.521 --> 29:18.762
See, I probably shouldn't
even be telling you this.

29:18.857 --> 29:20.097
I mean, I've tried
a couple of times,

29:20.192 --> 29:22.194
and I gotta say'
it works pretty good.

29:22.261 --> 29:23.865
I mean, you don't really eat.

29:23.929 --> 29:27.536
When you get hungry, you just
pop a couple of these bad boys.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.601
I carry a baggy full
around with me.

29:30.035 --> 29:34.211
Last time, I lost 27 pounds in 30 days.

29:34.906 --> 29:37.284
I'd pretty much
recommend it to anybody.

29:37.376 --> 29:41.119
These diets you read about.
I know this works.

29:41.213 --> 29:43.921
I mean, but of course, like anything
else, you gotta use your head.

29:43.982 --> 29:46.121
Time before,
I woke up in the hospital.

29:46.218 --> 29:47.162
But you just gotta
keep your mind

29:47.252 --> 29:50.324
on your business
like anything else.

29:50.422 --> 29:53.960
If you wanna lose weight,
this is it.

29:54.393 --> 29:57.772
After a few days, you don't
even want anything else.

29:58.263 --> 30:00.766
I'd absolutely
recommend it to anybody.

30:00.832 --> 30:03.438
But you said you
woke up in the hospital.

30:03.502 --> 30:07.575
What happened? Did you get a
systemic reaction or what?

30:08.173 --> 30:11.518
No, ma'am, it wasn't
anything like that.

30:11.610 --> 30:16.081
I was sitting in the street licking
my balls, and a car hit me.

30:23.355 --> 30:25.096
Take care now.
You hear?

31:20.379 --> 31:21.380
What?

31:21.480 --> 31:22.515
Yeah?
Well, too bad.

31:45.771 --> 31:47.273
Here you go, ma'am.

31:50.275 --> 31:51.276
Thank you.

31:53.278 --> 31:54.780
Enjoy your meal.
Thank you.

32:04.022 --> 32:06.798
I have something to
discuss with you...

32:06.958 --> 32:09.370
and I'm a bit scared.

32:10.095 --> 32:11.199
Hmm.

32:12.864 --> 32:14.036
Have you been bad?

32:14.533 --> 32:15.876
No.

32:18.737 --> 32:22.879
Actually, I don't have that
much to discuss, so...

32:25.477 --> 32:30.324
let me just give you this...

32:31.716 --> 32:33.718
and tell me what you think.

32:48.233 --> 32:49.678
Will you?

32:56.942 --> 32:59.582
Don't leave me hanging, here.

33:01.179 --> 33:02.749
Yes, I will!

33:16.127 --> 33:17.435
Try it.

33:30.041 --> 33:31.782
What, you didn't know?

33:33.879 --> 33:35.449
I knew...

33:36.615 --> 33:37.719
but I was scared anyway.

33:39.117 --> 33:40.858
That's good.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.556
It's so beautiful.

33:46.791 --> 33:48.793
You are a glory.

33:51.296 --> 33:52.741
I'm a glory?

33:53.131 --> 33:54.474
Yes.

33:55.033 --> 33:58.537
As in "glorious."
You're a glorious woman.

34:00.639 --> 34:03.813
And you're a man
of impeccable taste.

34:05.477 --> 34:07.081
Sorry,
I shouldn't have said that.

34:08.045 --> 34:09.922
You can't take it back.

34:10.715 --> 34:11.750
Here.

34:15.820 --> 34:18.232
I intend to love you until I die.

34:19.491 --> 34:20.833
Me first

34:20.992 --> 34:22.766
Not on your life.

34:42.179 --> 34:45.092
That's a nice ring.
How many carats is it?

34:45.250 --> 34:46.353
I don't know.

34:46.518 --> 34:48.190
You don't know?

34:48.353 --> 34:49.353
No.

34:49.454 --> 34:50.864
You've gotta be kidding me.

34:51.022 --> 34:52.092
No, I don't know.

34:52.257 --> 34:53.463
Let me see it.

34:53.858 --> 34:56.099
No, take it off.

35:02.300 --> 35:03.404
Hmm.

35:03.935 --> 35:06.643
It's a 3.5 carat.
Maybe 3.8.

35:07.606 --> 35:09.552
It's a nice stone.
It's Asscher cut.

35:09.708 --> 35:10.709
Thank you.

35:10.775 --> 35:11.879
Good color.

35:12.043 --> 35:14.489
Probably an F, or a G.

35:14.646 --> 35:19.220
Nothing visible,
so at least a VS2.

35:20.218 --> 35:21.418
Wanna know how much it's worth?

35:21.453 --> 35:22.557
No.

35:25.390 --> 35:27.063
You really don't, do you?

35:27.225 --> 35:28.795
I really don't

35:30.328 --> 35:32.569
So, have you set a date?

35:32.731 --> 35:34.142
Not yet.

35:34.299 --> 35:38.145
I really want to get married in the Church.
And he's okay with that

35:38.570 --> 35:41.744
He was married before, so I
thought that would be a problem.

35:41.906 --> 35:45.080
But the Church doesn't recognize
other marriages, so...

35:45.810 --> 35:46.845
Are you nervous?

35:46.978 --> 35:48.013
A little bit.

35:48.179 --> 35:50.181
Sometimes I am.

35:50.849 --> 35:52.760
So, you're a church lady?

35:53.918 --> 35:56.865
I go.
It's important to me.

35:57.689 --> 35:59.259
And what about confession?

35:59.824 --> 36:00.825
Yeah.

36:00.925 --> 36:02.495
Well, maybe not so much.

36:03.862 --> 36:06.672
Does the priest
ever ask you about sex?

36:08.366 --> 36:11.040
He doesn't ask, but you're
supposed to tell him everything.

36:11.836 --> 36:12.507
And all the nasty shit you did...

36:12.604 --> 36:14.174
you're just supposed
to pretend like

36:14.305 --> 36:15.875
you're never gonna
do it again, right?

36:16.708 --> 36:18.119
I guess.

36:18.276 --> 36:19.619
Strange.

36:24.716 --> 36:28.289
And suppose you've done
something really nasty?

36:29.120 --> 36:31.031
He doesn't press you
for the details?

36:34.292 --> 36:36.568
I don't think so.

36:38.630 --> 36:40.303
You're blushing.

36:40.365 --> 36:41.139
Uh-uh.

36:42.300 --> 36:44.871
Okay, we can change
the subject.

36:45.036 --> 36:47.141
We'll talk about my sex life.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.144
You're teasing.

36:52.477 --> 36:54.252
Just rattling your cage.

36:58.650 --> 37:00.561
What a world.

37:05.824 --> 37:07.394
Do you think
the world is strange?

37:11.830 --> 37:13.707
I meant yours.

37:18.269 --> 37:20.010
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Reiner, are you there?

37:20.171 --> 37:21.343
Counselor.

37:21.506 --> 37:22.780
I think I'm in.

37:22.941 --> 37:26.013
<i>You can't think, Counselor.
You're in or you're out.</i>

37:26.845 --> 37:28.847
All right, I'm in.
And thanks.

37:29.114 --> 37:30.923
Don't thank me yet.

37:31.082 --> 37:34.086
I won't say, "I hope you know what
you're doing" because you don't.

37:34.252 --> 37:37.461
<i>But, money problems
are serious problems.</i>

37:37.622 --> 37:40.125
<i>You keep telling yourself it's
not as bad as it appears...</i>

37:40.291 --> 37:42.202
and then one morning,
you realize it's worse.

37:42.360 --> 37:43.395
<i>Am I close?</i>

37:43.528 --> 37:45.599
My back is against
the fucking wall, man.

37:46.364 --> 37:48.037
I believe you.

37:50.368 --> 37:51.608
Do you have the cash?

37:51.770 --> 37:53.545
I'll have it Thursday.

37:53.705 --> 37:54.706
<i>All right.</i>

37:54.873 --> 37:57.376
I'll call Westray
and set it up.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.737
Counselor.
Westray.

38:14.893 --> 38:16.395
It's not dark
enough in here for you?

38:19.230 --> 38:20.265
Wow.

38:20.965 --> 38:22.740
That's a dandy.
What happened?

38:22.901 --> 38:24.505
Confrontation with a doorman.

38:24.736 --> 38:26.147
"Confrontation"?

38:26.304 --> 38:28.477
Jesus.
What did you say to him?

38:28.640 --> 38:31.086
I think I told him that he was
not to take it personally...

38:31.242 --> 38:32.442
but he should go fuck himself.

38:32.577 --> 38:33.817
What did he say to that?

38:33.978 --> 38:36.254
He said, "I'm gonna hurt
you, white person."

38:36.414 --> 38:37.484
What will you have?

38:37.749 --> 38:38.921
I'll have a Heineken.

38:39.083 --> 38:40.255
Make it two.

38:40.985 --> 38:43.591
I didn't know you
got into donnybrooks.

38:43.755 --> 38:44.756
I don't.

38:44.856 --> 38:46.426
Anyway, it was
in another country.

38:47.859 --> 38:50.772
And besides,
the wretch is dead.

38:50.929 --> 38:55.173
No, but I sent a pair of reliable
chaps to speak with him.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.108
Bloody expensive, too.

38:57.268 --> 38:58.269
You surprise me.

38:58.436 --> 39:00.541
Counselor,
I'm just a middle man.

39:00.705 --> 39:03.618
I know the smallest
crumb can devour us.

39:04.709 --> 39:08.782
You learn not to let anything pass.
You can't afford to.

39:08.947 --> 39:10.392
I should keep that in mind.

39:10.548 --> 39:13.552
You might keep that in mind.
So, fire away.

39:14.452 --> 39:17.023
All right.
What do you do with the money?

39:17.188 --> 39:18.792
What do I do,
or what does one do?

39:18.957 --> 39:19.958
What do you do?

39:21.392 --> 39:22.894
Mine goes offshore.

39:23.061 --> 39:25.501
We can talk about it if you like,
but you can't use my people.

39:26.030 --> 39:27.031
All right.

39:27.131 --> 39:29.372
Okay.
Let me make a call.

39:29.534 --> 39:30.535
All right.

39:30.635 --> 39:32.546
What else?

39:32.704 --> 39:33.978
You seem unsettled.

39:34.305 --> 39:35.807
I'm all right.

39:36.841 --> 39:37.979
Uh...

39:38.142 --> 39:39.662
What's the buy-out
for this whole deal?

39:39.811 --> 39:41.415
Net net?

39:41.980 --> 39:43.926
Yeah. Net net.

39:44.082 --> 39:45.522
It's hard to put
a cold dollar on it.

39:45.550 --> 39:47.587
You don't know what your
expenses are up front.

39:47.752 --> 39:51.928
It's 625 kilos, goes for about
$50 an ounce in Colombia.

39:52.090 --> 39:55.264
And the street value in Dallas
can go as high as two grand.

39:55.426 --> 39:56.837
Is that where it's going?
Dallas?

39:57.161 --> 39:59.107
No, it's going to Chicago.
Don't write that down.

39:59.597 --> 40:01.235
We're probably
looking at 20 million.

40:01.666 --> 40:03.407
Maybe a little more.

40:04.269 --> 40:06.249
It's 21,900 ounces.

40:07.438 --> 40:09.349
Good return on your investment

40:09.507 --> 40:10.850
Did you do that in your head?

40:11.009 --> 40:12.750
No, I remembered it.

40:13.778 --> 40:16.122
But I know someone who could
do that in their head.

40:16.948 --> 40:18.859
I'll bet you're right.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.422
If you're not in,
you need to tell me.

40:24.188 --> 40:25.531
I'm all right.

40:31.529 --> 40:34.271
It's just not our people.
You got the money guys.

40:34.365 --> 40:38.074
You gotta get money in dollars into
Mexico, and you gotta get it out.

40:38.136 --> 40:40.480
To do that,
you need a corporation.

40:40.571 --> 40:42.050
You can't go
through the US banks.

40:42.540 --> 40:45.783
And even then, you have to
have someone on the inside.

40:45.877 --> 40:47.220
You'd be surprised
at the people

40:47.278 --> 40:50.054
who are in this business,
very surprised.

40:52.717 --> 40:54.287
You have a corporation?

40:54.385 --> 40:57.798
No, of course not.
You just pay the points.

40:57.889 --> 41:00.301
The other option
is cash, of course.

41:00.391 --> 41:04.168
That's an even bigger headache
for all the obvious reasons.

41:04.262 --> 41:07.243
The biggest issue is not that your guy
is gonna fall for some pole dancer

41:07.298 --> 41:09.278
and go south with a
million of your duckets.

41:09.334 --> 41:10.472
The biggest issue
is someone is gonna

41:10.568 --> 41:12.445
figure out who he is
and what he's up to.

41:12.904 --> 41:14.281
Here we go.

41:23.081 --> 41:24.082
No, you're good.

41:24.248 --> 41:25.249
Thank you.

41:25.350 --> 41:27.091
Well, cheers.

41:27.251 --> 41:30.528
A plague of pustulant boils
upon all their scurvid asses.

41:30.922 --> 41:32.299
Is that your normal toast?

41:32.457 --> 41:33.959
Increasingly.

41:37.095 --> 41:39.632
So, if the drug wars stop...

41:39.797 --> 41:41.105
this will dry up, right?

41:41.265 --> 41:42.945
Let's just say,
it will be more than risky.

41:43.601 --> 41:46.138
That's the thing
Reiner doesn't seem to get.

41:47.205 --> 41:48.526
You may have
noticed his lifestyle

41:48.606 --> 41:50.984
has become increasingly lavish.

41:51.642 --> 41:52.985
I've noticed.

41:53.144 --> 41:56.284
I don't set foot in his clubs.
And I miss the bastard.

41:56.447 --> 42:00.486
We used to share
a taste for exotic women.

42:00.651 --> 42:03.222
In fact, a few times
shared the women themselves.

42:03.955 --> 42:05.835
That wouldn't include the
present one, would it?

42:07.325 --> 42:09.464
Now, why would you ask me that?

42:09.627 --> 42:12.005
No reason. Sorry.

42:13.464 --> 42:15.637
The answer is no, of course.
The civil answer.

42:15.800 --> 42:18.178
But I see a murky picture
forming in that mind of yours.

42:19.337 --> 42:20.975
How well do you know Malkina?

42:21.139 --> 42:23.244
Not very well.
Why?

42:24.675 --> 42:27.155
Because you don't know someone
until you know what they want...

42:27.178 --> 42:28.316
is why.

42:29.347 --> 42:30.826
I'll try and remember that

42:31.249 --> 42:32.489
Good.

42:35.253 --> 42:36.323
And Reiner?

42:36.421 --> 42:37.422
Reiner.

42:37.922 --> 42:40.163
Reiner is beyond advising.

42:40.658 --> 42:42.831
Reiner thinks
nothing bad can happen.

42:42.994 --> 42:45.338
And he's in love.

42:45.496 --> 42:47.339
You two are going
to open a new club?

42:47.498 --> 42:49.171
Is that all right?

42:49.333 --> 42:51.438
Sure. Why not?
What the fuck.

42:53.838 --> 42:56.444
Do you know how many people were
killed in Juárez last year?

42:56.941 --> 42:58.352
No. A lot.

42:58.509 --> 43:01.615
Yeah.
I think 3,000 is a lot.

43:02.213 --> 43:04.716
This is a different species,
Counselor.

43:04.882 --> 43:07.385
They will rip out your liver
and feed it to your dog.

43:07.885 --> 43:10.263
Jesus, Westray.

43:10.354 --> 43:12.561
Let me ask you. Who do you think
killed all those young girls

43:12.623 --> 43:15.103
before
the so-called drug wars?

43:16.027 --> 43:17.597
I don't know. Nobody knows.

43:17.695 --> 43:18.765
"Nobody knows"?

43:18.896 --> 43:19.966
No.

43:20.064 --> 43:22.943
Come on, Counselor.
Hundreds of girls,

43:23.067 --> 43:25.946
thousands, most likely.
Follow the money.

43:26.637 --> 43:29.641
If you have so much cash that you're
insulating your house with ii,

43:29.740 --> 43:31.651
and you've bought all the
clothes, and the cars,

43:31.742 --> 43:33.619
and the guns you can
find a place to put,

43:33.711 --> 43:37.318
and you're morally depraved
beyond all human recognition,

43:37.415 --> 43:39.224
what then do you
do with your money?

43:40.384 --> 43:41.556
Why do they kill them?

43:43.254 --> 43:47.794
Who knows? Fun, snuff films.
You'll see those will start turning up.

43:47.892 --> 43:49.803
Anyway, what do you
do with a 15-year-old

43:49.894 --> 43:53.137
you just ravaged in
some heinous manner?

43:54.565 --> 43:56.636
Do you think the drug lords
hired kidnappers

43:56.734 --> 43:58.680
to keep them supplied
with young girls?

43:58.769 --> 44:02.239
I think they have kidnappers
on full retainer.

44:05.076 --> 44:07.181
I should keep
that in mind, too.

44:08.412 --> 44:10.255
I can't advise you, Counselor.

44:11.582 --> 44:13.118
But you are advising me.

44:14.585 --> 44:17.657
I just need you to be sure
that you're locked in.

44:18.656 --> 44:20.966
Because I don't know...

44:22.326 --> 44:26.103
Maybe I should tell you what
Mickey Rourke told what's-his-face.

44:26.264 --> 44:29.438
That's my recommendation anyway,
Counselor. Don't do it.

44:30.134 --> 44:32.114
"This arson is a serious crime."

44:32.270 --> 44:34.944
Yeah. And so is this.

44:38.142 --> 44:40.679
I guess I'm a little
taken aback at the

44:40.811 --> 44:43.348
cautionary nature
of this conversation.

44:44.182 --> 44:46.458
Good word,
"cautionary."

44:46.617 --> 44:48.494
In Scots law, it defines
an instrument in which

44:48.619 --> 44:50.496
one person stands as
surety for another.

44:50.788 --> 44:52.665
As surety.
Yes.

44:52.823 --> 44:54.302
Sounds a bit primitive.

44:54.458 --> 44:55.493
It is.

44:55.660 --> 44:56.661
The problem being, of course...

44:56.794 --> 45:01.334
is what happens when the surety
becomes the more attractive holding?

45:01.966 --> 45:03.536
What about you?

45:03.701 --> 45:07.376
I can vanish in a heartbeat
with my money. Can you?

45:08.973 --> 45:13.183
Truth is, Counselor, I can walk
away from all of this in a second.

45:13.344 --> 45:15.153
And I mean all of it.

45:15.313 --> 45:18.021
You're not gonna believe this, but
I'm going to tell you anyway.

45:18.182 --> 45:19.991
I think about my life.

45:20.651 --> 45:22.062
I can live in a monastery.

45:22.153 --> 45:26.192
Scrub the steps, clean the
pots, try some gardening.

45:27.725 --> 45:29.068
You're serious.

45:29.227 --> 45:30.672
Very.

45:31.229 --> 45:32.230
Why don't you?

45:33.497 --> 45:35.875
In a word? Women.

45:42.173 --> 45:44.414
I've seen it all, Counselor.

45:44.575 --> 45:48.216
It's all shit.
It's all shit.

45:49.714 --> 45:51.193
I'll be in touch.

45:53.351 --> 45:54.921
Hey, Counselor?

45:55.086 --> 45:57.430
You want to know why Jesus
wasn't born in Mexico?

45:57.588 --> 45:58.760
No, why?

45:58.923 --> 46:01.870
Couldn't find three
wise men or a virgin.

46:05.563 --> 46:08.908
And, Counselor, here's
something else to consider.

46:09.066 --> 46:12.206
The beheadings and the mutilations?
That's just business.

46:12.370 --> 46:14.543
You gotta keep up appearances.

46:14.705 --> 46:17.777
It's not like there's some
smoldering rage at the bottom of it.

46:18.442 --> 46:21.116
Let's see if we can guess who
it is they really want to kill.

46:21.279 --> 46:22.724
I don't know.
Who?

46:23.214 --> 46:24.386
You, Counselor.

46:24.782 --> 46:26.386
You.

46:53.177 --> 46:54.155
Hey.

46:54.245 --> 46:56.247
Did you bring cigarettes?

47:12.163 --> 47:14.336
They treating you well?

47:14.498 --> 47:16.444
Oh, yeah.
Peachy.

47:22.306 --> 47:24.377
You've got a preliminary
hearing on the 17th.

47:26.210 --> 47:28.315
What size dress do you wear?

47:28.446 --> 47:30.119
I wear a five.

47:31.215 --> 47:32.489
What about shoes?

47:34.185 --> 47:35.528
Five?

47:35.686 --> 47:36.790
Yeah.

47:37.521 --> 47:38.625
Hat?

47:38.789 --> 47:39.961
What?

47:40.124 --> 47:41.364
What size hat?

47:41.525 --> 47:42.799
A hat?

47:43.327 --> 47:45.568
I don't know what size hat.

47:45.730 --> 47:47.676
What the fuck do
I need a hat for?

47:48.966 --> 47:51.674
A hat?
You're shitting me.

47:52.069 --> 47:53.070
Yes.

47:54.705 --> 47:56.707
You're a smartass.

47:58.008 --> 47:59.817
You had me going
there for a minute.

48:02.580 --> 48:05.584
So, you gonna get me
something sexy to wear?

48:05.750 --> 48:06.888
No.

48:08.052 --> 48:10.589
You'll probably have me looking
like a fucking schoolmarm.

48:11.889 --> 48:13.266
How about a businesswoman?

48:13.424 --> 48:15.768
Yeah. Some business.

48:15.926 --> 48:16.996
All right.

48:17.428 --> 48:19.066
What was it
you wanted to tell me?

48:20.564 --> 48:22.874
My kid is in jail.

48:23.501 --> 48:25.071
Oh, boy.

48:25.669 --> 48:26.704
Where?

48:27.405 --> 48:29.078
Fort Hancock.

48:31.075 --> 48:32.748
What was he doing
in Fort Hancock?

48:33.611 --> 48:35.522
He was coming to see me.

48:36.347 --> 48:37.724
What's he in jail for?

48:37.915 --> 48:39.053
Speeding.

48:39.216 --> 48:40.559
Speeding?
Yeah.

48:43.287 --> 48:45.198
Son of a bitch.

48:45.723 --> 48:47.361
What, he couldn't pay the fine?

48:47.958 --> 48:52.634
He had $12,000 on him,
but they took that off him.

48:53.964 --> 48:55.739
How did you find this out?

48:56.233 --> 48:57.906
He called.

48:59.036 --> 49:00.811
What else is he charged with?

49:01.439 --> 49:02.884
I don't know.

49:03.607 --> 49:05.644
Some other stuff.

49:06.210 --> 49:07.883
And how fast was he going?

49:08.045 --> 49:09.718
206.

49:11.315 --> 49:13.261
206.
Yeah.

49:14.218 --> 49:16.562
What is that, "206"?

49:17.555 --> 49:19.557
That's not a speed.

49:20.090 --> 49:23.731
That's somebody's weight,
or a time of day.

49:23.894 --> 49:27.501
You're telling me he was going
206 miles an hour? In what?

49:28.098 --> 49:30.135
On that Jap bike of his.

49:31.101 --> 49:33.411
Listen, if you could get
his money back...

49:33.571 --> 49:35.915
he could pay the fine
and get out of there.

49:36.073 --> 49:38.280
He's not getting
his money back.

49:39.176 --> 49:40.951
How much is the fine?

49:41.445 --> 49:42.617
$400.

49:42.780 --> 49:44.123
Jesus.

49:45.282 --> 49:47.353
I don't guess you
would spring for it.

49:48.118 --> 49:49.620
Christ, $400?

49:50.454 --> 49:51.797
Yeah.

49:54.358 --> 49:55.359
All right.

49:55.793 --> 49:57.101
"All right" what?

49:57.528 --> 49:59.474
All right, I'll get him out.

49:59.930 --> 50:01.807
Thanks. I owe you.

50:02.299 --> 50:04.040
Yes, you do.

50:05.503 --> 50:06.811
How about a blowjob?

50:09.607 --> 50:11.280
You would still owe me $380.

50:12.543 --> 50:14.716
Damn, but you are a smartass.

50:15.379 --> 50:18.383
I know.
You bring it out in me.

50:23.354 --> 50:24.662
Lighten up, Ruthie.

50:24.822 --> 50:26.028
Don't call me that

50:27.224 --> 50:28.635
I hate that name.

50:29.493 --> 50:31.495
I don't even like "Ruth."

50:39.737 --> 50:41.683
Take care, Ruth.

50:42.373 --> 50:43.716
Guard.

50:52.917 --> 50:54.521
Pull over.

51:10.167 --> 51:11.237
How are you doing?

51:15.839 --> 51:16.943
Get this thing out of here.

51:17.608 --> 51:18.586
You got it.

51:18.676 --> 51:19.711
Go.

52:47.798 --> 52:50.039
Sorry.
I got held up.

52:52.836 --> 52:53.871
How are you, man?

52:54.104 --> 52:57.847
You see a place like this in the cold
light of clay, it looks pretty seedy.

52:58.008 --> 52:59.385
But you get the right lighting
in here...

52:59.543 --> 53:01.682
and some music,
some good-looking girls...

53:01.845 --> 53:03.005
and it's a whole other world.

53:03.113 --> 53:04.114
Jesus.

53:04.181 --> 53:05.683
We're looking
for cash flow here.

53:08.452 --> 53:10.898
So, how soon do you think?

53:11.055 --> 53:13.057
Two weeks.
Three, max.

53:14.291 --> 53:15.634
Yeah.

53:16.727 --> 53:17.899
Are you gonna
keep the dance floor?

53:18.062 --> 53:19.632
Yeah. A dance floor takes
up a lot of space...

53:19.797 --> 53:22.539
but you try and chat
up a girl at a bar...

53:22.700 --> 53:24.702
she's supposed to
tell you to fuck off.

53:24.868 --> 53:26.745
She doesn't want to
look like a bitch.

53:26.904 --> 53:29.475
But, you ask a chick to dance...

53:31.141 --> 53:33.143
well, you got a better shot.

53:34.311 --> 53:35.483
You know Peterson, right?

53:35.646 --> 53:36.818
Sure.

53:36.880 --> 53:38.257
Yeah, do you know
he speaks Portuguese?

53:38.382 --> 53:39.725
No.

53:39.817 --> 53:42.730
Yeah, his family was from Brazil.

53:42.820 --> 53:47.860
So this cousin
of Peterson shows up,

53:47.925 --> 53:50.769
and we are all out
here on Saturday night.

53:50.861 --> 53:53.705
And the cousin is
asking Peterson,

53:53.831 --> 53:56.675
"How do you say,
'May I have this dance?'"

53:56.734 --> 53:58.543
Only we get wind of it.

53:58.602 --> 54:02.106
And we shut Peterson up and we are
coaching him on how to say it.

54:02.206 --> 54:07.383
Repeat after me,
"I want to eat your pussy." Right?

54:07.911 --> 54:10.619
And we work with him till
he's pretty much got it down.

54:10.714 --> 54:15.185
"I want to eat your pussy."
And we send him off.

54:15.252 --> 54:17.698
He's this kind of
elegant-looking guy anyway.

54:17.755 --> 54:22.568
So he goes off across the room,

54:22.626 --> 54:25.368
and he picks out this really,
really great-looking girl.

54:25.429 --> 54:30.606
And he stands in front of her, gives
her this little bow, and says,

54:30.701 --> 54:33.477
"I want to eat your pussy."

54:33.570 --> 54:35.641
And of course,
the table gets pretty quiet,

54:35.739 --> 54:38.219
and the girl looks up at him
and says, "What did you say?"

54:38.275 --> 54:41.484
And he says it again. A little
bow, "I want to eat your pussy."

54:42.379 --> 54:44.791
And she stares at him
for a minute

54:44.882 --> 54:48.159
and then looks
over to see past him,

54:48.252 --> 54:51.790
and of course, hears these
three guys across the room

54:51.889 --> 54:56.133
all hugging each other and just
weeping, weeping with merriment.

54:56.226 --> 55:01.073
So she gets up, and she takes
Peterson's cousin by the hand,

55:01.131 --> 55:03.171
and she takes him out
to this van in the parking lot

55:03.233 --> 55:05.645
and proceeds to
fuck his brains out.

55:06.236 --> 55:10.150
He's gone for an hour. We don't
know what the hell is going on.

55:10.240 --> 55:12.516
And finally, she leads him back in,

55:12.643 --> 55:14.919
and gives him this big, sexy kiss,

55:14.978 --> 55:17.822
and she looks over at us to
make sure we're all watching,

55:17.915 --> 55:19.195
and sends him back to the table.

55:19.283 --> 55:21.263
Well, we're going nuts, nuts.

55:21.318 --> 55:23.159
Peterson is trying to get
the story out of him,

55:23.187 --> 55:25.030
and he's jabbering away,

55:25.122 --> 55:27.864
and we're like, "What's he saying?
What's he saying?"

55:27.958 --> 55:33.965
It's the whole thing. It's blowjob.
It's the works, the works.

55:34.765 --> 55:37.006
Jesus, we're just
fucking flabbergasted.

55:37.100 --> 55:42.209
And we are just sitting there
staring at each other.

55:42.306 --> 55:45.150
And after a while,
Peterson gets up

55:45.275 --> 55:48.154
and looks at us,
and off he goes.

55:48.212 --> 55:51.056
He crosses the floor
to where this

55:51.181 --> 55:54.025
cool-looking girl is
sitting by herself.

55:54.117 --> 55:57.064
And he gives her a little bow

55:57.154 --> 55:59.191
and announces that he
wants to eat her pussy.

55:59.289 --> 56:00.290
Well, of course.

56:00.357 --> 56:04.499
Well, this time, the husband is
coming out of the men's room.

56:04.561 --> 56:08.134
And he's about,
I don't know, 11 feet tall.

56:08.198 --> 56:11.873
This guy hit him so hard that
he came out of his loafers.

56:11.969 --> 56:13.642
He came out of his loafers.

56:14.805 --> 56:21.086
So Peterson is lying dead on the
dance floor in his sucked feet...

56:21.178 --> 56:23.488
Anyway, they called an ambulance,

56:23.580 --> 56:25.890
and they hauled Peterson
off to the hospital,

56:25.983 --> 56:28.429
and he's got a concussion
and a broken jaw.

56:28.518 --> 56:30.930
Jesus.
Yeah.

56:31.021 --> 56:32.159
What did you guys do?

56:32.322 --> 56:33.392
Nothing. We left.

56:33.490 --> 56:35.401
We had enough fun
for one evening.

56:35.525 --> 56:39.371
Anyway, the other big
space-eater is the bandstand.

56:40.197 --> 56:42.541
I think what I'm gonna do
is take the wall out...

56:43.367 --> 56:46.007
and get rid of the hallway,
yeah.

56:46.169 --> 56:47.239
I think that will do it.

56:47.404 --> 56:49.111
Yeah. All right.

56:49.506 --> 56:52.919
I'll talk to my guy and it
should take two or three days.

56:53.076 --> 56:54.350
That's my boy.

57:14.364 --> 57:15.809
There he is.

57:17.200 --> 57:19.703
I won't be able to get what the
kid is saying. Is that okay?

57:20.270 --> 57:23.080
We don't care what
the kid is saying.

57:26.310 --> 57:27.584
Did you get it?

57:28.145 --> 57:30.819
Yeah. It's not much.

57:31.448 --> 57:33.325
That's okay.

57:34.117 --> 57:35.960
Keep your eye on him.

57:36.053 --> 57:37.123
I am.

57:37.220 --> 57:38.995
This guy doesn't read
the fucking newspapers.

57:39.957 --> 57:40.958
I know.

57:41.558 --> 57:43.504
Could you see what it was?

57:44.328 --> 57:47.070
Nope.
But it's in the helmet.

57:47.965 --> 57:49.569
Yeah.

57:49.733 --> 57:51.178
It's in the helmet.

58:02.079 --> 58:03.990
<i>Yes?</i>
We got him.

58:04.147 --> 58:08.152
<i>Good. Stay with him,
and call me back in an hour.</i>

58:23.300 --> 58:24.335
Come here.

58:26.336 --> 58:29.476
Well, Counselor,
how are you making it?

58:30.474 --> 58:31.475
I'm all right.

58:32.175 --> 58:33.210
Is this your lady?

58:34.378 --> 58:35.356
It is.

58:35.445 --> 58:36.480
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

58:36.847 --> 58:38.326
Me and the Counselor
go back a ways.

58:38.782 --> 58:39.988
We do, I'm afraid.

58:40.150 --> 58:41.220
Don't be afraid.

58:41.318 --> 58:42.797
Hell, I'm okay with everything.

58:42.886 --> 58:44.447
Are you okay with everything,
Counselor?

58:46.857 --> 58:48.029
I am if you are.

58:48.225 --> 58:50.466
See, now, ain't he just
the best son of a bitch?

58:50.627 --> 58:51.970
All right, Tony, let's go.

58:52.129 --> 58:53.802
How long have you known
this guy, petunia?

58:53.964 --> 58:56.069
Long enough.

58:56.233 --> 58:58.008
Maybe you should listen
to your lady friend.

58:58.168 --> 58:59.368
Is that what you do, Counselor?

58:59.369 --> 59:00.370
Pretty much.

59:00.470 --> 59:01.630
Does he keep you entertained?

59:02.472 --> 59:03.473
None of your business.

59:03.640 --> 59:05.517
Because you look to me
like you might get bored easy.

59:05.675 --> 59:07.018
Tony, let's go.

59:07.711 --> 59:08.712
Tony, I'm leaving.

59:08.812 --> 59:10.587
Hell, Counselor,
keep your seat.

59:11.181 --> 59:12.592
You don't have
to get up for me.

59:12.749 --> 59:15.593
See, petunia, the Counselor has a
way of sullin' up like a possum...

59:15.752 --> 59:17.060
when he don't get his own way.

59:17.220 --> 59:19.097
I'm going to say
you probably noticed it.

59:19.656 --> 59:21.602
But that ain't
really the problem.

59:21.758 --> 59:23.066
The real problem is...

59:23.226 --> 59:25.172
his thin skin makes
it okay in his eyes

59:25.328 --> 59:27.205
for you to wind up
under the bus.

59:28.432 --> 59:29.843
Do you know what I'm saying?

59:30.267 --> 59:33.578
Anyhow, that's how I see it.

59:33.937 --> 59:35.439
You take care now, you hear?

59:38.608 --> 59:39.609
Baby!

59:43.113 --> 59:44.353
Who was that?

59:44.514 --> 59:46.187
It's an old client.

59:48.518 --> 59:49.861
It goes with the territory.

59:52.355 --> 59:53.766
I'm sorry.

01:00:19.082 --> 01:00:20.083
Hi.

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:23.624
"Hi"?

01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:27.432
Oh, um...

01:00:30.427 --> 01:00:32.498
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

01:00:34.764 --> 01:00:35.902
And?

01:00:37.334 --> 01:00:39.905
How long has it been
since your last confession?

01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:42.744
Well, I've never been before.

01:00:43.607 --> 01:00:45.143
This is my first

01:00:45.842 --> 01:00:46.843
Are you Catholic?

01:00:46.943 --> 01:00:48.251
No.

01:00:49.913 --> 01:00:51.756
Then I cannot
give you absolution.

01:00:51.915 --> 01:00:52.985
I know...

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:55.230
but I just wanted to tell
somebody what I had done...

01:00:55.285 --> 01:00:57.356
and I thought, "Why not
go to a professional?"

01:00:57.521 --> 01:00:59.467
Have you thought about
taking instructions?

01:00:59.623 --> 01:01:01.466
That's not
something I do very well.

01:01:01.625 --> 01:01:03.605
I mean, in order to
become a Catholic.

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:05.433
Then you could confess...

01:01:05.595 --> 01:01:07.506
and you will be
forgiven for your sins.

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:10.842
What if they're unforgivable?

01:01:12.469 --> 01:01:13.971
Nothing is unforgivable.

01:01:14.137 --> 01:01:15.172
Oh, yeah?

01:01:15.772 --> 01:01:18.946
Well, I haven't killed anybody,
but I've been pretty bad.

01:01:19.476 --> 01:01:21.956
Look, we have people here
waiting to go to confession...

01:01:22.112 --> 01:01:23.113
so, I'm sorry.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.782
They can wait.

01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:27.685
I did.

01:01:27.784 --> 01:01:29.058
Who did you talk to about this?

01:01:29.152 --> 01:01:30.790
Why did I talk to somebody?

01:01:30.954 --> 01:01:32.558
You said "Bless me, Father."

01:01:32.722 --> 01:01:35.122
Well, I asked a friend but she
didn't know I was gonna do it.

01:01:35.492 --> 01:01:36.698
So we're done here then?

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:38.539
I haven't told you my sins yet.

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:41.642
I don't want to hear your sins.
There would be no point.

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:44.301
Were you baptized?

01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:46.176
I don't know.
It's possible.

01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:48.091
Your parents never told you?

01:01:48.138 --> 01:01:49.640
I never knew my parents.

01:01:49.806 --> 01:01:52.047
They were thrown out of a helicopter
into the Atlantic Ocean...

01:01:52.209 --> 01:01:53.688
when I was three.

01:01:54.744 --> 01:01:56.018
Listen...

01:01:57.013 --> 01:01:58.933
you don't have to do
the whole forgiveness thing.

01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:01.154
All you have to do is listen.

01:02:01.985 --> 01:02:03.658
To the sins.

01:02:05.822 --> 01:02:08.268
Women tell you
about sex, don't they?

01:02:08.425 --> 01:02:10.336
I can't talk about that

01:02:11.094 --> 01:02:14.337
Yeah, but every woman who
goes to confess tells you...

01:02:14.497 --> 01:02:16.577
that she's an adulterer or
fornicator or something...

01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:19.213
or why else would she be there?

01:02:19.369 --> 01:02:23.044
So you must have a very
unusual picture of women.

01:02:23.773 --> 01:02:26.219
You must think that they're
just having sex all the time...

01:02:26.376 --> 01:02:28.219
You really need to go now.

01:02:28.378 --> 01:02:30.380
If you don't leave, I leave.

01:02:30.547 --> 01:02:31.719
Wait, where are you going?

01:02:33.216 --> 01:02:34.889
I wasn't finished.

01:02:38.021 --> 01:02:39.762
I know.

01:02:40.123 --> 01:02:42.729
I just wanted to
hear your voice.

01:02:44.928 --> 01:02:46.805
I really miss you.

01:02:46.896 --> 01:02:49.968
<i>I really miss you.
I miss you so much.</i>

01:02:51.101 --> 01:02:52.944
<i>You know what else I miss?</i>

01:02:53.036 --> 01:02:54.709
Don't go there.

01:02:57.741 --> 01:03:00.051
<i>Are you sure?</i>

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:02.556
You're just glowing
with sexual health?

01:03:05.048 --> 01:03:06.083
Is that bad?

01:03:06.216 --> 01:03:07.286
<i>No.</i>

01:03:07.384 --> 01:03:08.795
I love it.

01:03:09.653 --> 01:03:11.997
<i>Do you miss me?</i>

01:03:12.088 --> 01:03:13.726
Yes.

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:16.396
Bad. Badly.

01:03:19.396 --> 01:03:22.002
<i>You haven't been taking liberties
with your person, have you?</i>

01:03:22.098 --> 01:03:23.736
No.

01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:28.411
You couldn't touch it
with a powder puff?

01:03:33.076 --> 01:03:35.078
<i>Do you remember
the night we met?</i>

01:03:35.578 --> 01:03:38.923
Yes, the airport parking lot.

01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:41.857
Did you know I would
do it that night?

01:03:43.753 --> 01:03:46.529
Did I know you would
do it with me?

01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:48.433
Of course.

01:03:50.026 --> 01:03:51.369
Why there?

01:03:51.461 --> 01:03:55.671
<i>I don't know. I thought it would
be exciting, like In high school.</i>

01:03:55.765 --> 01:03:57.836
I remember asking you
if you were all right,

01:03:57.934 --> 01:04:00.471
'cause you were
gasping like an asthmatic.

01:04:04.941 --> 01:04:09.117
Oh, my goodness.
Is this phone sex?

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:13.858
I wish you were here with me.

01:04:13.983 --> 01:04:15.291
<i>I know.</i>

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:19.834
Life is being in bed with you.

01:04:19.889 --> 01:04:22.369
Everything else
is just waiting.

01:04:24.127 --> 01:04:25.868
I love you very much.

01:04:28.898 --> 01:04:31.037
I love you so much.

01:04:31.901 --> 01:04:32.971
Good night.

01:04:33.136 --> 01:04:34.171
<i>Good night.</i>

01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:42.685
I don't know.

01:04:42.846 --> 01:04:45.850
Women have funny
ideas about sex.

01:04:47.183 --> 01:04:49.993
They're supposed
to be so modest.

01:04:51.087 --> 01:04:52.395
Let me tell you,
when they get it

01:04:52.522 --> 01:04:53.830
in their heads how
they want to fuck...

01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:55.162
they're like a freight train.

01:04:55.825 --> 01:04:57.065
Sign here.

01:04:57.827 --> 01:05:00.433
The things I've
learned about women.

01:05:00.697 --> 01:05:01.698
Fuck.

01:05:01.865 --> 01:05:03.936
About half of it
I would like to forget.

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:06.171
I'm not sure if I follow you.

01:05:06.336 --> 01:05:08.907
What is it you would like
to forget, for instance?

01:05:09.072 --> 01:05:10.915
You don't want to know.

01:05:13.009 --> 01:05:14.010
Sure I do.

01:05:15.845 --> 01:05:17.646
I don't know. Let's talk
about something else.

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:19.182
Here.

01:05:19.449 --> 01:05:21.861
Just pull up your socks
and tell me.

01:05:24.354 --> 01:05:25.594
Yeah...

01:05:26.356 --> 01:05:27.699
I don't know.

01:05:28.792 --> 01:05:30.465
What is it you would
like to forget?

01:05:30.727 --> 01:05:31.728
All right.

01:05:31.895 --> 01:05:34.705
I would like to forget about
Malkina fucking my car.

01:05:35.064 --> 01:05:36.236
What?

01:05:36.399 --> 01:05:37.605
See?

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:39.041
What did you just say?

01:05:39.235 --> 01:05:42.910
I said I would like to forget
about Malkina fucking my car.

01:05:44.073 --> 01:05:45.381
I think.

01:05:45.975 --> 01:05:48.387
What the hell are
you talking about?

01:05:49.045 --> 01:05:51.719
Do you remember
that yellow California I had?

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:53.590
Sure. Nice car.

01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:55.730
Very nice car.

01:05:56.986 --> 01:06:00.559
Anyway, this was a while back,
not that long.

01:06:00.723 --> 01:06:05.229
We'd been getting it on for a
while, and we came back one night.

01:06:05.395 --> 01:06:07.739
<i>We were staying
up at Cloudcroft.</i>

01:06:08.398 --> 01:06:12.005
<i>We drove out on a golf course
and parked.</i>

01:06:12.235 --> 01:06:14.272
And we're sitting there, talking...

01:06:14.437 --> 01:06:17.907
and for no particular reason
that I could see...

01:06:18.074 --> 01:06:20.611
she slides off her knickers...

01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:23.750
<i>and hands them to me
and gets out of the car.</i>

01:06:23.947 --> 01:06:25.227
I asked her what
she was doing...

01:06:25.281 --> 01:06:28.091
and she says,
"I'm going to fuck your car."

01:06:29.285 --> 01:06:30.320
All right.

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:32.161
Leave the door open.

01:06:36.125 --> 01:06:37.433
So...

01:06:38.261 --> 01:06:42.437
<i>she goes around and climbs up
on the hood of the Ferrari...</i>

01:06:42.932 --> 01:06:47.779
<i>and pulls her dress up
around her waist...</i>

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:50.708
and spreads herself
across the windshield

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:53.446
in front of me
with no panties on.

01:06:54.611 --> 01:06:59.492
<i>And she's had this Brazilian
wax job, you know?</i>

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:01.556
<i>Don't even think
I'm making this up.</i>

01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:03.459
<i>You can't make
this up, all right?</i>

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:05.122
<i>I mean, she was a dancer.</i>

01:07:05.288 --> 01:07:08.497
<i>So, she does this full split...</i>

01:07:08.825 --> 01:07:13.570
and then she starts rubbing
herself up and down on the glass.

01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:17.009
<i>Then she leans down
to see if I'm watching.</i>

01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:19.806
<i>Like, no, I'm sitting there
reading my email.</i>

01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:23.642
<i>And she kisses me upside down.</i>

01:07:23.806 --> 01:07:25.342
<i>And then she tells me
that she's going to come.</i>

01:07:25.508 --> 01:07:28.318
<i>I thought, "I 'm losing my fucking mind.
That's what's happening here."</i>

01:07:28.478 --> 01:07:30.355
<i>It was like one of those...</i>

01:07:31.481 --> 01:07:35.657
one of those catfish things.
You know? One of those...

01:07:37.353 --> 01:07:38.991
One of those
bottom-feeders you see

01:07:39.155 --> 01:07:40.828
going up the side
of the aquarium...

01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:42.833
sucking its way up the glass.

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:45.933
<i>I mean, it was, I don't know...</i>

01:07:47.997 --> 01:07:49.271
hallucinatory.

01:07:49.432 --> 01:07:52.106
You see a thing like that,
it changes you.

01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:55.008
Jesus.

01:07:55.171 --> 01:07:56.878
Yeah, tell me about it.

01:07:58.575 --> 01:08:00.020
Did she...?

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:03.182
Did she what?

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:05.382
Did she come?

01:08:05.848 --> 01:08:08.351
Yeah. Sure, yeah.

01:08:09.118 --> 01:08:11.189
<i>Finally she climbs down
and she comes around...</i>

01:08:11.354 --> 01:08:13.034
<i>and she gets in the car
and shuts the door.</i>

01:08:13.189 --> 01:08:15.396
I hand her her knickers,
she puts them in her purse...

01:08:15.558 --> 01:08:18.868
and she looks at me to see
what I thought about that.

01:08:20.697 --> 01:08:22.698
<i>What I thought about it?</i>

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:25.205
Well, I don't know
what I thought about it.

01:08:25.368 --> 01:08:27.746
I mean, I still don't.

01:08:29.037 --> 01:08:33.042
It was too gynecological
to be sexy. Almost.

01:08:33.743 --> 01:08:35.723
But mostly,
I was just fucking stunned.

01:08:37.145 --> 01:08:39.145
And I asked her if she had
ever done that before...

01:08:39.148 --> 01:08:41.719
and she said she had done everything before.
And I believe her.

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:47.662
So she starts the engine
and turns on the lights,

01:08:47.756 --> 01:08:49.134
but the windshield
is so smeared,

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:51.466
and I didn't have
anything to wipe it with.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:55.600
And she, of course, suggested
that I get out and lick it off.

01:08:55.665 --> 01:08:57.508
But I tried the wipers,

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.801
and naturally, the windshield
washer thing doesn't work,

01:08:59.801 --> 01:09:02.162
because Italians don't really
believe in that sort of thing.

01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:05.444
And finally,
I took off my socks

01:09:05.508 --> 01:09:09.581
and got out of the car
and used them.

01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:16.658
Do you think she knew what kind

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:17.858
of effect this might
have on a guy?

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:21.468
Jesus, Counselor, are you kidding?
She knows everything.

01:09:23.926 --> 01:09:26.099
You don't think this is
an odd thing to tell me?

01:09:26.828 --> 01:09:28.866
I think it is an odd thing.

01:09:29.032 --> 01:09:30.875
No, I mean,
why is it okay to tell

01:09:30.966 --> 01:09:32.139
a thing like that
about somebody...

01:09:32.201 --> 01:09:34.374
Somebody I'm banging?

01:09:36.773 --> 01:09:37.877
Come on, Reiner.

01:09:38.041 --> 01:09:40.885
Okay, I don't know,
you're probably right.

01:09:41.444 --> 01:09:44.050
Maybe I wanted to see
what you would say.

01:09:44.212 --> 01:09:47.216
Maybe there's more to it than that.
Maybe I'm scared.

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:49.124
You're scared?

01:09:49.285 --> 01:09:50.286
Yeah.

01:09:50.353 --> 01:09:52.457
Probably, yeah.
Sometimes...

01:09:53.288 --> 01:09:55.565
she scares the shit out of me.

01:09:55.725 --> 01:09:59.036
Because of that? No, not that.
But...

01:10:00.163 --> 01:10:01.665
You're in love with her.

01:10:01.831 --> 01:10:03.572
I don't know what I am.

01:10:03.733 --> 01:10:06.805
Yeah, I guess
I'm in love with her, but...

01:10:08.071 --> 01:10:10.381
you don't think
that's cause for worry?

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:13.316
It's like being in love with...

01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:16.986
easeful death.

01:10:17.413 --> 01:10:19.773
Well, I don't know what it is
that you're trying to tell me.

01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:21.657
I know.

01:10:22.819 --> 01:10:24.890
Does this have anything
to do with the deal?

01:10:25.922 --> 01:10:27.697
I don't know.

01:10:30.493 --> 01:10:32.564
You're right.

01:10:32.729 --> 01:10:34.572
I shouldn't have told you.

01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:36.233
Just forget it.
Forget it.

01:10:36.599 --> 01:10:38.510
Forget it?
Yeah.

01:10:39.869 --> 01:10:41.177
How do you propose I do that?

01:10:41.337 --> 01:10:43.681
Jesus, Counselor,
how do I know?

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:45.285
Just forget it.

01:11:04.594 --> 01:11:06.039
I gotta go.

01:11:11.868 --> 01:11:13.905
Sir, may I help you?

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:19.378
Nope.

01:14:05.708 --> 01:14:07.949
<i>Are you there?</i>

01:14:09.712 --> 01:14:11.089
Anything?

01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:13.791
<i>He's coming.</i>

01:14:15.117 --> 01:14:16.926
Yeah, I hear him.

01:14:17.954 --> 01:14:19.297
All right, let's do it.

01:15:24.854 --> 01:15:26.629
Jamie, come in.

01:15:29.492 --> 01:15:30.971
<i>Are we okay?</i>

01:15:31.994 --> 01:15:33.302
We're good.

01:16:08.864 --> 01:16:09.865
Hi.

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:11.667
Hi.

01:16:15.771 --> 01:16:17.273
I had a dream about you.

01:16:17.373 --> 01:16:18.374
Did you?

01:16:18.441 --> 01:16:20.011
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:23.922
<i>Very strange. I woke up, and I
could still remember the dream,</i>

01:16:24.013 --> 01:16:28.223
but I could not remember
why it was so disturbing.

01:16:29.018 --> 01:16:30.588
<i>You know?</i>

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:33.764
<i>I just wanted to call
and see if you were all right.</i>

01:16:34.924 --> 01:16:36.699
Are you superstitious?

01:16:37.359 --> 01:16:39.202
I don't think so.

01:16:40.196 --> 01:16:42.574
No more than the next person.

01:16:43.199 --> 01:16:45.201
<i>And who would that be?</i>

01:16:46.135 --> 01:16:47.205
Excuse me?

01:16:47.570 --> 01:16:49.311
The next person.

01:16:52.908 --> 01:16:54.546
You're not gay, are you?

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:57.549
No, of course not.

01:16:59.748 --> 01:17:01.557
I shouldn't have called.

01:17:03.319 --> 01:17:06.892
<i>I know you think
my world is naive.</i>

01:17:06.956 --> 01:17:09.402
But is that so bad,
to have hope?

01:17:10.559 --> 01:17:13.938
<i>I don't know.
I can't advise you.</i>

01:17:15.131 --> 01:17:16.269
I know.

01:17:17.967 --> 01:17:21.437
You should be careful
what you wish for, angel.

01:17:22.271 --> 01:17:24.148
<i>You might not get it.</i>

01:17:24.773 --> 01:17:25.808
I know.

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:27.848
Do you?

01:17:28.577 --> 01:17:30.079
Yes, I do.

01:17:30.813 --> 01:17:33.487
Good.
I'll see you at the club.

01:18:18.127 --> 01:18:19.572
Do you know which truck it is?

01:18:19.728 --> 01:18:22.334
Yeah.
It's got Arizona plates.

01:18:38.314 --> 01:18:39.691
Do you know how it goes?

01:18:39.848 --> 01:18:40.883
Yeah.

01:18:41.584 --> 01:18:43.257
It's color-coded.

01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:45.896
Red to red.

01:18:47.723 --> 01:18:49.498
Green to green.

01:18:49.992 --> 01:18:52.233
Black to black.

01:18:52.494 --> 01:18:54.337
See if it will start.

01:18:59.568 --> 01:19:00.774
Wait a minute.

01:19:01.704 --> 01:19:03.843
This thing has
got a switch on it.

01:19:07.343 --> 01:19:08.447
Try it now.

01:19:21.757 --> 01:19:23.395
Counselor.

01:19:23.692 --> 01:19:25.137
We've got a problem.

01:19:26.795 --> 01:19:28.069
<i>Are you there?</i>

01:19:29.398 --> 01:19:30.706
I'm here.

01:19:32.201 --> 01:19:33.202
How bad a problem?

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:35.381
Let's say pretty bad.

01:19:35.537 --> 01:19:37.210
And then multiply it by 10.

01:19:37.373 --> 01:19:38.408
Fuck.

01:19:38.574 --> 01:19:40.144
Meet me in the atrium
at the Coronado.

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:42.589
<i>Coronado? When?</i>

01:19:42.745 --> 01:19:44.156
Now.

01:19:44.313 --> 01:19:47.624
We can start getting used
to our new lifestyle.

01:20:18.814 --> 01:20:21.590
Morning.

01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:23.127
Have you seen the paper?

01:20:23.285 --> 01:20:24.320
Nope.

01:20:29.525 --> 01:20:31.766
Do you know who
the Green Hornet is?

01:20:33.595 --> 01:20:35.165
The Green Hornet?
Yes.

01:20:35.331 --> 01:20:36.639
He's a cartoon character.

01:20:36.799 --> 01:20:38.335
He's a biker.

01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:40.342
Shit.

01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:41.940
Mmm.

01:20:42.471 --> 01:20:43.882
All right, what?

01:20:44.039 --> 01:20:45.780
Is he in custody?

01:20:45.941 --> 01:20:46.942
It's in the paper.

01:20:47.776 --> 01:20:48.880
What has he done?

01:20:49.044 --> 01:20:50.523
You don't know anything about this?

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:51.714
About what?

01:20:52.147 --> 01:20:54.127
Like I said, it's in the paper.

01:20:59.621 --> 01:21:01.191
He had no ID on him?
No.

01:21:01.357 --> 01:21:02.734
No head either.

01:21:02.891 --> 01:21:04.063
What the hell is this?

01:21:04.226 --> 01:21:06.365
I was hoping you would tell me.

01:21:06.528 --> 01:21:09.338
I had a call from
our business partners.

01:21:09.498 --> 01:21:10.875
They wanted to speak with you.

01:21:11.734 --> 01:21:14.044
It seems the deceased
was working for them.

01:21:14.203 --> 01:21:15.876
Now the shipment is missing...

01:21:16.038 --> 01:21:19.315
and all they have to go on is
that he was a client of yours.

01:21:19.475 --> 01:21:21.546
Client?
He wasn't a client.

01:21:21.744 --> 01:21:23.087
You got him out of jail.

01:21:23.312 --> 01:21:25.485
That doesn't make him a client.

01:21:25.647 --> 01:21:29.185
It was a speeding ticket, for Christ's sake.

01:21:29.251 --> 01:21:30.491
Jesus.

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:32.699
I am perfectly
willing to believe

01:21:32.755 --> 01:21:33.859
you had nothing
to do with this...

01:21:33.922 --> 01:21:36.334
but I am not the party
you need to convince.

01:21:36.492 --> 01:21:38.369
Convince of what,
for Christ's sake?

01:21:38.861 --> 01:21:41.034
That this is just
some sort of coincidence.

01:21:41.196 --> 01:21:45.110
They're a pragmatic lot. They
don't believe in coincidences.

01:21:45.267 --> 01:21:47.838
They've heard of them,
they've just never seen one.

01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:51.560
So, what happened
to the shipment?

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:52.841
I asked them that

01:21:53.008 --> 01:21:54.112
And?

01:21:54.843 --> 01:21:56.845
<i>They said, "Se fue."</i>

01:21:57.346 --> 01:21:58.848
It's gone?
Mmm.

01:21:59.915 --> 01:22:00.950
Jesus.

01:22:01.116 --> 01:22:05.121
Does his mother know? I guess she does.
I need to call her.

01:22:06.722 --> 01:22:08.463
That is probably
not a good idea.

01:22:08.624 --> 01:22:09.625
Why?

01:22:09.792 --> 01:22:11.533
She said she's going
to have you killed.

01:22:12.027 --> 01:22:13.870
Sweet Jesus!

01:22:14.296 --> 01:22:17.277
Sorry about that.
What can I get you to drink?

01:22:17.366 --> 01:22:18.572
Hemlock.

01:22:18.634 --> 01:22:19.704
I'm sorry?

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:21.907
I'll have an OJ and a coffee.

01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:24.271
He'll be having a double Maalox
and a side of Oxycontin.

01:22:24.873 --> 01:22:26.944
Just bring us the two coffees.

01:22:27.409 --> 01:22:28.444
And my OJ.

01:22:35.484 --> 01:22:37.430
How did you wind up with her?

01:22:38.954 --> 01:22:40.297
The mother?

01:22:40.622 --> 01:22:43.262
Yes, the mother.
The mother of all mothers.

01:22:43.559 --> 01:22:45.766
Court appointment.

01:22:45.928 --> 01:22:47.965
It's an appeal. One of
Ferguson's fucked-up deals.

01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:52.237
Look, they can't hook me onto
this thing, mother or no mother.

01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:56.977
Well, I don't know what the kid
told her, or what she told the kid.

01:22:57.139 --> 01:22:59.619
But at this juncture, I would
avoid trying to explain myself.

01:22:59.942 --> 01:23:01.979
What do they think I
would do with this shit?

01:23:02.144 --> 01:23:03.521
They don't know.
They don't care.

01:23:03.679 --> 01:23:05.480
They think everybody
is hooked into something.

01:23:05.914 --> 01:23:07.916
You need to think
about this, Counselor.

01:23:08.150 --> 01:23:09.925
These people are out 20 mil.

01:23:10.085 --> 01:23:12.361
Do you understand
how serious this is?

01:23:14.122 --> 01:23:17.035
They think we're all involved,
don't they? Reiner, too?

01:23:17.192 --> 01:23:20.264
What do you think?
You fucking genius.

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:26.108
Have you ever
seen a snuff film?

01:23:26.435 --> 01:23:28.108
No. You?

01:23:28.270 --> 01:23:29.271
Would you?

01:23:29.371 --> 01:23:30.611
I would not.

01:23:31.773 --> 01:23:34.720
Because the consumer
of the product

01:23:34.810 --> 01:23:36.312
is essential to its production.

01:23:36.378 --> 01:23:40.349
You cannot watch without
being accessory to a murder.

01:23:41.450 --> 01:23:42.930
Will there be anything else?

01:23:42.951 --> 01:23:44.294
No, thank you.

01:23:48.357 --> 01:23:50.132
Do you know somebody
who's seen one?

01:23:50.792 --> 01:23:52.635
Yes, I do.

01:23:52.794 --> 01:23:55.866
He said the young girl was looking
into the camera, crying...

01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:58.068
when her head was lopped off.

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:00.802
Think about that
the next time you do a line.

01:24:01.036 --> 01:24:02.208
I don't do drugs.

01:24:02.371 --> 01:24:04.317
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

01:24:04.473 --> 01:24:06.146
Because what follows,
I would hope

01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:08.814
would be beyond your
powers of imagination.

01:24:10.646 --> 01:24:14.560
They let a figure in, wearing
only a hood with eyeholes...

01:24:14.716 --> 01:24:19.825
to address himself to the
headless and quivering corpse.

01:24:20.422 --> 01:24:25.235
Which, you must remember, was selected
because of her youth and beauty.

01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:28.397
And all of this,
he has paid for.

01:24:29.331 --> 01:24:34.007
So, what do you think that cost?
Ballpark?

01:24:34.836 --> 01:24:36.247
Jesus.

01:24:37.072 --> 01:24:38.176
Mmm.

01:24:39.174 --> 01:24:40.414
God.

01:24:40.776 --> 01:24:42.778
The point, Counselor...

01:24:42.945 --> 01:24:45.186
is that you may think
there are things that

01:24:45.347 --> 01:24:47.588
these people are
simply incapable of.

01:24:47.749 --> 01:24:49.023
There are not.

01:24:51.186 --> 01:24:53.928
Counselor, I don't know
what you should do.

01:24:54.456 --> 01:24:57.528
But at this point,
it's out of your hands.

01:25:00.028 --> 01:25:01.371
What about you?

01:25:01.530 --> 01:25:04.306
I've known this day was
coming for a long time.

01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:07.544
Do I regret what I've done?
That's sophomoric.

01:25:07.703 --> 01:25:10.775
I should've jumped ship a
long time ago, and I didn't.

01:25:12.374 --> 01:25:14.285
So, what happens next?

01:25:15.277 --> 01:25:17.757
I'm going to go find a nice,
quiet place,

01:25:17.879 --> 01:25:20.325
and sit down and
think about this.

01:25:20.482 --> 01:25:23.793
I would suggest you do the
same, but I know you won't.

01:25:24.486 --> 01:25:26.295
If you think,
Counselor, that you can

01:25:26.421 --> 01:25:28.230
live in this world
and be no part of it...

01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:29.751
then all I can say
is you're wrong.

01:25:30.726 --> 01:25:33.570
It's not that you're
going down, Counselor...

01:25:34.062 --> 01:25:35.905
it's what you're
taking down with you.

01:26:07.362 --> 01:26:08.500
Excuse me, ma'am.

01:26:09.031 --> 01:26:10.874
I'm terribly sorry
to bother you...

01:26:11.033 --> 01:26:14.879
but my phone is out
and it's my kid's birthday.

01:26:15.203 --> 01:26:18.116
May I please use your phone
for just a minute?

01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:20.180
Sure.

01:26:20.776 --> 01:26:22.016
Thank you.

01:26:30.118 --> 01:26:32.064
Where are you?

01:26:32.621 --> 01:26:34.965
I can't call you
on my cell anymore.

01:26:35.123 --> 01:26:39.469
Now, listen to me. Go home and
wait for me there, I'll call you.

01:26:39.628 --> 01:26:41.801
I'll explain everything later.

01:26:44.366 --> 01:26:46.039
I love you.

01:26:46.201 --> 01:26:48.477
I'll call you later.
Okay.

01:26:50.906 --> 01:26:52.146
Thank you.

01:26:52.307 --> 01:26:54.309
I hope you didn't call China.

01:26:55.544 --> 01:26:56.545
Have a nice day.

01:26:56.645 --> 01:26:57.646
You, too.

01:27:15.397 --> 01:27:16.774
Fuck.

01:27:34.783 --> 01:27:36.353
Switch off the engine.

01:27:37.285 --> 01:27:38.355
They're not cops.

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:40.422
These guys are cartel.

01:27:52.467 --> 01:27:54.208
Switch off your engine!

01:27:57.372 --> 01:27:58.874
Go check it out.

01:28:10.552 --> 01:28:11.553
Ah!

01:30:03.431 --> 01:30:04.933
No problems.

01:30:05.166 --> 01:30:06.668
Got to go.

01:30:06.835 --> 01:30:08.746
Bodies on the road.

01:30:11.072 --> 01:30:12.073
You talked to him.

01:30:12.173 --> 01:30:13.516
Yeah, I talked to him.

01:30:15.944 --> 01:30:18.288
I don't feel comfortable here.
Can we go somewhere else?

01:30:18.446 --> 01:30:19.925
Uh, sure.

01:30:20.782 --> 01:30:21.852
Come on.

01:30:34.429 --> 01:30:38.206
You think I know something you don't, Counselor?
What would that be?

01:30:38.266 --> 01:30:41.736
I don't know what "how bad" means.
Bad is bad.

01:30:41.870 --> 01:30:43.713
Westray thinks we're fucked.
"We"?

01:30:44.039 --> 01:30:45.074
Yeah.

01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:47.484
All right.
I suppose I could ask you

01:30:47.609 --> 01:30:49.987
if you've got a rat
in your pocket.

01:30:50.145 --> 01:30:52.250
You're not serious.

01:30:52.414 --> 01:30:56.055
Well, when was the last time
you tried to call him?

01:30:56.217 --> 01:30:57.287
Yesterday. Why?

01:30:57.552 --> 01:30:58.656
Why?

01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:00.891
Because I couldn't
reach him now, all right?

01:31:06.494 --> 01:31:07.905
What are you going to do?

01:31:09.631 --> 01:31:11.167
I don't know.

01:31:11.933 --> 01:31:14.072
What are you?
I don't know.

01:31:16.404 --> 01:31:18.484
That's what Westray said.
But he did know, didn't he?

01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:24.117
What are you going
to use for money?

01:31:24.846 --> 01:31:26.484
I've got some money.
I don't think so.

01:31:26.648 --> 01:31:28.288
If you had any serious
money, you wouldn't

01:31:28.316 --> 01:31:29.920
be in this jackpot
in the first place.

01:31:30.085 --> 01:31:31.120
I might.
Oh, yeah?

01:31:31.186 --> 01:31:33.598
Well, I know why I'm in it.
Do you?

01:31:33.755 --> 01:31:35.462
Sure. Same as you.
Greed.

01:31:35.623 --> 01:31:36.761
Yeah?

01:31:36.925 --> 01:31:39.701
No. You got in trouble.

01:31:39.861 --> 01:31:42.865
I tried to appeal
to your greed two years ago.

01:31:43.031 --> 01:31:45.204
No deal.
Now, it's too late.

01:31:45.633 --> 01:31:47.840
It's too late.

01:31:49.004 --> 01:31:50.204
What do you think I should do?

01:31:50.205 --> 01:31:53.516
I don't know, Counselor.
I don't know.

01:31:54.642 --> 01:31:56.713
They know that you're stupid.

01:31:57.679 --> 01:31:59.124
They just don't
know how stupid.

01:32:03.151 --> 01:32:05.893
You say that like
it's my hole card.

01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:11.061
Maybe it is.

01:32:11.226 --> 01:32:13.206
Suppose you could sit
down and have a chat

01:32:13.294 --> 01:32:14.694
with these guys,
what would you say?

01:32:15.196 --> 01:32:16.698
I'd tell them the truth.

01:32:16.865 --> 01:32:19.812
You're just a fucking wonder,
do you know that?

01:32:19.968 --> 01:32:21.845
Go ahead.
Go ahead what?

01:32:22.003 --> 01:32:24.005
With the truth.
I'd like to hear it.

01:32:24.406 --> 01:32:26.166
I'd tell them that
I never even met this kid.

01:32:26.207 --> 01:32:28.087
That I got him out of jail
on a speeding charge.

01:32:28.143 --> 01:32:29.679
Okay, how did he
happen to hire you?

01:32:29.844 --> 01:32:32.518
He didn't. I got him out of
jail as a favor to his mother.

01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:34.819
How do you happen
to know the mother?

01:32:34.983 --> 01:32:36.826
I was appointed by
the court to represent her

01:32:36.985 --> 01:32:38.828
in an appeal on
a capital murder case.

01:32:38.987 --> 01:32:40.898
Do you know what her son did
for a living?

01:32:40.989 --> 01:32:41.933
No.

01:32:42.023 --> 01:32:43.434
But you do now.

01:32:45.260 --> 01:32:46.261
I do now.

01:32:46.394 --> 01:32:47.395
And would it please you to tell

01:32:47.495 --> 01:32:49.236
the court what
that occupation was?

01:32:50.532 --> 01:32:51.875
How did I get in court?

01:32:52.834 --> 01:32:54.609
I thought I was
talking to cartel guys.

01:32:54.769 --> 01:32:58.046
Sorry, sorry, sorry, I was
giving you the easiest way out.

01:33:00.041 --> 01:33:01.179
Very funny.

01:33:01.342 --> 01:33:03.549
Yeah, well, probably not.

01:33:05.747 --> 01:33:07.283
I'm really worried, baby.

01:33:08.116 --> 01:33:11.222
It's going to be all right.
I'll take care of it.

01:33:11.352 --> 01:33:12.353
<i>Don't worry.</i>

01:33:12.454 --> 01:33:13.865
Can't you meet me someplace?

01:33:14.022 --> 01:33:15.194
<i>I can't right now.</i>

01:33:15.356 --> 01:33:17.427
That's not possible
that you can't.

01:33:18.093 --> 01:33:19.094
God, I miss you.

01:33:20.762 --> 01:33:21.797
Meet me.

01:33:22.130 --> 01:33:24.406
We really have to be careful.

01:33:24.566 --> 01:33:26.705
<i>How bad is it?</i>

01:33:27.602 --> 01:33:28.774
How bad is it?

01:33:29.471 --> 01:33:30.814
All right, where?

01:33:33.274 --> 01:33:34.776
How about Boise?

01:33:35.143 --> 01:33:36.588
<i>Boise?</i>

01:33:37.145 --> 01:33:38.146
Boise.

01:33:41.116 --> 01:33:42.390
Why Boise?

01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:44.086
What's wrong with Boise?

01:33:44.552 --> 01:33:46.293
Have you ever been to Boise?

01:33:46.554 --> 01:33:48.056
No, have you?

01:33:49.057 --> 01:33:50.331
No.

01:33:53.928 --> 01:33:55.236
Do you have a hotel?

01:33:56.731 --> 01:33:58.108
I'm looking as we speak.

01:34:01.970 --> 01:34:03.074
Tomorrow.

01:34:03.905 --> 01:34:05.111
Boise.

01:34:06.074 --> 01:34:07.747
<i>Yeah, Boise.</i>

01:34:08.576 --> 01:34:11.079
<i>I'll leave you a message
at the Delta counter.</i>

01:34:11.246 --> 01:34:12.623
Okay.

01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:15.420
<i>Baby, I'm so sorry.
I'll set this straight.</i>

01:34:15.583 --> 01:34:16.584
I know.

01:34:16.651 --> 01:34:18.995
<i>I love you.
I love you.</i>

01:34:19.487 --> 01:34:20.932
<i>Be safe.</i>

01:34:52.687 --> 01:34:54.030
Son.

01:34:54.789 --> 01:34:56.962
Where do you think this
is going, mi capitan?

01:34:58.326 --> 01:34:59.361
This?

01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:00.666
Yes.

01:35:04.499 --> 01:35:07.639
I can't really take
your question seriously.

01:35:10.872 --> 01:35:12.818
It's going where it's going.

01:35:13.975 --> 01:35:17.218
Well, either you think
it's all going to work out...

01:35:17.378 --> 01:35:20.052
or you don't want
to think about it at all.

01:35:21.983 --> 01:35:24.190
Because the third alternative
is unacceptable?

01:35:24.352 --> 01:35:25.888
Yes.

01:35:26.054 --> 01:35:28.056
The excluded middle.

01:35:30.158 --> 01:35:32.502
I don't like decisions made for me.

01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:35.834
But if you put them off, waiting
for the maximum information...

01:35:35.997 --> 01:35:37.840
that may be what happens.

01:35:37.999 --> 01:35:39.603
You think there's
still space enough

01:35:39.701 --> 01:35:42.910
to make the decision,
and then there isn't.

01:35:43.838 --> 01:35:45.044
"Space."
Yeah.

01:35:45.106 --> 01:35:46.176
Hmm.

01:35:47.342 --> 01:35:50.050
Greed really takes you
to the edge, doesn't it?

01:35:50.411 --> 01:35:51.412
Mmm.

01:35:51.512 --> 01:35:55.517
That's not what greed does.
That's what greed is.

01:35:57.185 --> 01:36:00.189
When the axe comes
through the door...

01:36:00.355 --> 01:36:02.528
I'll already be gone.
You know that.

01:36:04.359 --> 01:36:06.032
That's fair enough.

01:36:10.431 --> 01:36:12.240
You're in trouble.

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:14.910
Yeah, probably.

01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:18.043
I don't want to lose you.

01:36:19.907 --> 01:36:21.409
There.

01:36:23.378 --> 01:36:24.789
I know.

01:36:24.946 --> 01:36:26.448
Are you hungry?

01:36:26.614 --> 01:36:28.423
I'm starving.

01:38:57.865 --> 01:38:59.867
Fuck. Fuck!

01:39:15.149 --> 01:39:16.150
Shit!

01:39:29.897 --> 01:39:32.503
Intercept him!
We want him alive!

01:39:32.667 --> 01:39:33.907
<i>Got it!</i>

01:39:52.753 --> 01:39:53.754
Fuck.

01:40:15.977 --> 01:40:17.115
Ah!

01:40:17.879 --> 01:40:19.222
No!

01:40:19.614 --> 01:40:21.685
What the fuck did you do?

01:41:39.026 --> 01:41:40.546
<i>Do you know where Reiner is?</i>

01:41:40.695 --> 01:41:41.867
Nope.

01:41:43.297 --> 01:41:44.401
He doesn't answer his cell.

01:41:44.565 --> 01:41:47.136
And the phone at the club
is no longer in service.

01:41:47.568 --> 01:41:48.740
Where are you?

01:41:49.070 --> 01:41:50.879
I'm at home.

01:41:51.038 --> 01:41:53.040
I'm surprised to hear
you're still there.

01:41:53.874 --> 01:41:55.319
Well, I won't be in an hour.

01:41:58.546 --> 01:41:59.581
An hour.

01:42:00.314 --> 01:42:02.726
Yeah. Where are you?

01:42:03.284 --> 01:42:04.729
I'm not at home.

01:42:04.885 --> 01:42:06.159
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:08.664
What are you,
a mental defective?

01:42:08.823 --> 01:42:10.463
I can't advise you,
Counselor. Call a cab.

01:42:11.892 --> 01:42:13.132
Listen...

01:42:14.395 --> 01:42:17.069
if your definition of a friend is
someone who will die for you...

01:42:17.231 --> 01:42:18.471
then you don't
have any friends.

01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:21.471
<i>I gotta go.
You take care.</i>

01:43:48.322 --> 01:43:49.323
No!

01:44:15.082 --> 01:44:16.083
Dad! Dad!

01:44:16.183 --> 01:44:17.218
Dad! Dad!

01:44:18.119 --> 01:44:19.894
Dad! Dad!
Dad! Dad!

01:44:20.521 --> 01:44:21.522
Dad!
Dad!

01:44:22.256 --> 01:44:23.758
Dad!
What?

01:45:11.739 --> 01:45:13.309
Are you all right here, sir?

01:45:13.407 --> 01:45:14.477
Sorry?

01:45:14.575 --> 01:45:15.747
Can I bring you something?

01:45:18.012 --> 01:45:19.252
Would you do something for me?

01:45:19.847 --> 01:45:20.917
Yes, sir.
Of course.

01:45:25.586 --> 01:45:26.792
Here's my card.

01:45:27.755 --> 01:45:29.962
I'm a guest at the hotel.

01:45:31.592 --> 01:45:33.196
What I wish you
would do for me is go

01:45:33.327 --> 01:45:35.007
to the desk and see
if I have any messages.

01:45:36.096 --> 01:45:38.007
I know you're wondering
why I don't go myself,

01:45:38.132 --> 01:45:40.043
but I've bothered
them so much...

01:45:40.201 --> 01:45:43.478
I think they're beginning to figure
me for some sort of nutcase.

01:45:43.637 --> 01:45:45.878
Sure. I'm afraid
they'll stop looking.

01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:47.280
You got it.

01:46:25.079 --> 01:46:26.490
<i>Abogado Hernandez?</i>

01:46:26.647 --> 01:46:27.990
<i>I need your help.</i>

01:46:28.148 --> 01:46:29.650
<i>Can I come see you?</i>

01:46:29.817 --> 01:46:31.990
<i>No problem. Tomorrow.</i>

01:46:32.486 --> 01:46:33.692
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:46:47.601 --> 01:46:49.012
Upstairs.

01:47:07.621 --> 01:47:09.032
All right.

01:47:10.457 --> 01:47:12.368
I have made the call.

01:47:12.893 --> 01:47:14.372
You understand?

01:47:15.696 --> 01:47:17.698
If it is all right,
it is all right.

01:47:17.865 --> 01:47:20.812
Don't put me in the center.
Okay?

01:47:21.702 --> 01:47:23.238
"In the middle."

01:47:23.404 --> 01:47:25.543
In the middle, yeah.

01:47:27.541 --> 01:47:29.077
What do I owe you?

01:47:32.980 --> 01:47:36.928
You owe me nothing, Counselor.
We are friends.

01:47:37.084 --> 01:47:38.995
Just a handshake.

01:47:43.924 --> 01:47:45.164
Thank you.

01:47:45.893 --> 01:47:48.271
It will be a yes or no.

01:47:54.401 --> 01:47:55.846
I will do what I can do.

01:47:56.337 --> 01:47:58.908
But you must
know that this is...

01:47:59.073 --> 01:48:00.746
a long shot.

01:48:00.908 --> 01:48:02.251
I know.

01:48:03.410 --> 01:48:04.411
Thank you.

01:48:15.189 --> 01:48:18.193
Look, the last time I spoke to
them, they were in Midland, Texas.

01:48:18.359 --> 01:48:20.361
That was about two days ago.

01:48:20.928 --> 01:48:23.101
So, I called up the Sheriff
there and I asked him...

01:48:23.263 --> 01:48:25.663
had they found any dead bodies
along the side of the highway?

01:48:25.799 --> 01:48:29.941
And he said that they did. And I
said, "Thank you," and I hung up.

01:48:31.271 --> 01:48:33.877
I know you think I'm kidding.

01:48:34.041 --> 01:48:35.816
But I'm not.

01:48:36.443 --> 01:48:38.218
And I'm not out.

01:48:38.379 --> 01:48:41.792
That's right. And I'm not
kidding about that either.

01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:44.293
Really?

01:48:44.952 --> 01:48:49.458
No, I know where the truck is going.
I always did.

01:48:49.790 --> 01:48:51.133
Really?

01:48:51.792 --> 01:48:55.001
Well, I think that falls under
the category of "tough shit."

01:48:55.162 --> 01:48:56.971
We're all done here.

01:49:11.678 --> 01:49:13.351
Here.
Thanks.

01:49:42.776 --> 01:49:45.450
In the last two accounts, we're
only an hour different...

01:49:46.346 --> 01:49:48.019
but it's another day.

01:49:48.182 --> 01:49:49.183
It's tomorrow.

01:49:50.284 --> 01:49:52.787
See, I love that.
I love that.

01:49:54.188 --> 01:49:57.032
So, what have we got?
625 kilos?

01:49:57.191 --> 01:49:59.034
Yeah, something like that.

01:49:59.193 --> 01:50:01.230
Shit. You know,
of all the people...

01:50:01.395 --> 01:50:03.397
you and I should
know if electronic money

01:50:03.530 --> 01:50:05.532
earns an extra
day of interest...

01:50:05.699 --> 01:50:08.373
when it crosses
an international date line.

01:50:08.535 --> 01:50:10.378
Right? I'm just saying.

01:50:10.537 --> 01:50:12.380
That's a good question.

01:50:14.641 --> 01:50:16.211
Why is there a fourth drum?

01:50:17.711 --> 01:50:18.883
No reason.

01:50:19.046 --> 01:50:20.650
It's just convenient.

01:50:21.582 --> 01:50:22.822
Convenient?
Mm-hmm.

01:50:22.983 --> 01:50:24.985
Yeah, maybe we have a traveler.

01:50:25.152 --> 01:50:27.098
Like somebody, you wish
for them to go away...

01:50:27.254 --> 01:50:29.734
so, you send them to America.
That's all.

01:50:29.890 --> 01:50:30.891
Can I have a look?

01:50:30.958 --> 01:50:31.959
You want to look?

01:50:32.092 --> 01:50:33.435
Yeah.
Sick bastard.

01:50:36.897 --> 01:50:38.342
Do you know who he is?

01:50:38.499 --> 01:50:41.173
No. Fuck, no.
He's some <i>pinche pasajero.</i>

01:50:43.737 --> 01:50:44.841
A passenger?

01:50:45.005 --> 01:50:47.246
Yeah.
An immigrant.

01:50:50.277 --> 01:50:52.951
So, it's just a way to
get rid of a body?

01:50:53.113 --> 01:50:54.353
Yeah.

01:50:57.918 --> 01:50:58.919
From Mexico?

01:50:59.086 --> 01:51:00.929
No, no, no.
Colombia.

01:51:01.088 --> 01:51:02.761
He came all the way from Colombia?

01:51:02.823 --> 01:51:03.824
Mm-hmm.

01:51:03.924 --> 01:51:04.959
What are you
going to do with him?

01:51:05.092 --> 01:51:06.469
Nothing.

01:51:06.627 --> 01:51:07.867
He just goes back in the truck?

01:51:08.028 --> 01:51:09.632
Yeah.
Goes back in the truck.

01:51:09.796 --> 01:51:11.434
Then what?

01:51:11.598 --> 01:51:12.941
Nothing. It's just normal.

01:51:13.367 --> 01:51:14.937
But they think
it's a fucking joke.

01:51:15.102 --> 01:51:18.140
They think it's funny, so they
do this shit to me, you know?

01:51:18.438 --> 01:51:21.612
But in this business, you gotta
have a sense of humor, or else...

01:51:26.446 --> 01:51:28.289
So, what happens to him?

01:51:29.049 --> 01:51:30.722
Nothing. I told you...

01:51:30.884 --> 01:51:32.830
they go back together
in the truck.

01:51:32.986 --> 01:51:34.966
He's inside, they paint it,
he rides around.

01:51:35.122 --> 01:51:37.466
They try to sell it at
auction maybe, maybe not.

01:51:37.624 --> 01:51:39.797
He rides around some more,
sucking up the shit.

01:51:40.961 --> 01:51:43.567
Hey, welcome to America.
Huh?

01:51:47.734 --> 01:51:51.147
<i>Yes, but I can only tell
you what I already told our friend.</i>

01:51:51.305 --> 01:51:53.478
<i>There is no one to talk to.</i>

01:51:54.408 --> 01:51:56.479
Could I come to The Florida?

01:51:56.643 --> 01:51:58.486
<i>The Florida is closed.</i>

01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:02.824
I would do
whatever you suggest.

01:52:02.983 --> 01:52:05.486
<i>I have no suggestions,
Counselor.</i>

01:52:11.325 --> 01:52:13.100
We could meet someplace.

01:52:13.260 --> 01:52:15.001
<i>We're meeting now.</i>

01:52:19.566 --> 01:52:21.842
I'm not sure you
understand my position.

01:52:22.002 --> 01:52:23.948
<i>But I do, Counselor.</i>

01:52:24.104 --> 01:52:27.517
Actions create consequences
which produce new worlds...

01:52:27.674 --> 01:52:29.620
and they're all different

01:52:30.510 --> 01:52:34.014
Where the bodies are buried in the
desert, that is a certain world.

01:52:34.181 --> 01:52:37.355
Where the bodies are simply left
to be found, that is another.

01:52:38.118 --> 01:52:41.099
<i>And all these worlds,
heretofore unknown to us...</i>

01:52:41.255 --> 01:52:43.599
<i>they must have always been
there, must they not?</i>

01:52:45.692 --> 01:52:47.137
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:52:48.629 --> 01:52:49.972
Did you say something?

01:52:51.098 --> 01:52:53.100
I don't know what I was saying.

01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:55.043
<i>Counselor, at some point,</i>

01:52:55.869 --> 01:53:00.716
you have to acknowledge the reality
of the world that you're in.

01:53:00.774 --> 01:53:02.811
There's not some other world.

01:53:02.909 --> 01:53:05.446
<i>This is not a hiatus.</i>

01:53:05.545 --> 01:53:06.888
Hiatus.

01:53:10.384 --> 01:53:12.295
I believe the word is "hiatus“.

01:53:12.919 --> 01:53:15.331
Can you spell that for me,
please?

01:53:15.422 --> 01:53:21.839
H-I-A-T-US.

01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:24.905
Hiatus.
Thank you, Counselor.

01:53:28.902 --> 01:53:30.404
Will you help me?

01:53:30.570 --> 01:53:32.572
<i>I would urge you
to see the truth</i>

01:53:32.739 --> 01:53:34.685
<i>of the situation you're in,
Counselor.</i>

01:53:34.841 --> 01:53:37.082
That is my advice.

01:53:37.244 --> 01:53:41.249
It is not for me to tell you what
you should have done or not done.

01:53:42.182 --> 01:53:46.528
<i>The world in which you seek to
undo the mistakes that you made...</i>

01:53:46.687 --> 01:53:50.464
<i>Is different from the world
where the mistakes were made.</i>

01:53:51.358 --> 01:53:53.964
You are now at the crossing.

01:53:54.127 --> 01:53:58.007
And you want to choose, but
there is no choosing there.

01:53:58.765 --> 01:54:00.836
<i>There's only accepting.</i>

01:54:01.001 --> 01:54:04.676
<i>The choosing was
done a long time ago.</i>

01:54:05.839 --> 01:54:07.546
Are you there, Counselor?

01:54:08.208 --> 01:54:09.346
Yes.

01:54:09.509 --> 01:54:11.182
I don't mean to offend you...

01:54:11.345 --> 01:54:14.224
but reflective men
often find themselves...

01:54:14.381 --> 01:54:17.294
at a place removed
from the realities of life.

01:54:17.851 --> 01:54:20.991
In any case, we should
all prepare a place...

01:54:21.455 --> 01:54:23.457
where we can
accommodate all the tragedies

01:54:23.557 --> 01:54:25.559
that sooner or later
will come to our lives.

01:54:25.726 --> 01:54:29.003
But this is an economy
few people care to practice.

01:54:29.162 --> 01:54:31.904
Do you know
the words of Machado?

01:54:32.065 --> 01:54:34.011
<i>I know his name.</i>

01:54:38.004 --> 01:54:39.483
Lovely poet.

01:54:41.241 --> 01:54:43.847
<i>Machado was a schoolteacher...</i>

01:54:44.010 --> 01:54:46.889
<i>and he married a young,
beautiful girl.</i>

01:54:47.047 --> 01:54:49.254
<i>And he loved her very much.</i>

01:54:49.416 --> 01:54:51.521
<i>And she died.</i>

01:54:51.685 --> 01:54:54.393
<i>And then he became
a great poet.</i>

01:54:55.322 --> 01:54:57.495
I'm not going to
become a great poet.

01:54:57.657 --> 01:55:00.399
<i>No, perhaps not. But even
if you were to do so...</i>

01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:01.937
<i>it would not help you.</i>

01:55:02.996 --> 01:55:05.533
Machado would have
traded every word,

01:55:05.665 --> 01:55:08.202
every poem,
every verse he ever wrote...

01:55:08.935 --> 01:55:12.348
for one more hour
with his beloved.

01:55:12.506 --> 01:55:15.077
And that is because
when it comes to grief...

01:55:15.242 --> 01:55:17.518
the normal rules of
exchange do not apply,

01:55:17.611 --> 01:55:19.852
because grief transcends value.

01:55:20.414 --> 01:55:25.124
<i>A man would give entire nations
to lift grief off his heart...</i>

01:55:25.285 --> 01:55:29.028
and yet, you cannot buy
anything with grief.

01:55:29.189 --> 01:55:32.693
Because grief is worthless.

01:55:33.794 --> 01:55:36.240
Why are you telling me this?

01:55:36.396 --> 01:55:41.141
<i>Because you continue to deny the
reality of the world you're in.</i>

01:55:42.102 --> 01:55:45.208
<i>Do you love your wife so much,
so completely...</i>

01:55:45.372 --> 01:55:49.377
that you would exchange places
with her upon the wheel?

01:55:50.410 --> 01:55:53.550
And I don't mean dying,
because dying is easy.

01:55:55.816 --> 01:55:58.820
Yes! Yes, damn you!

01:56:01.988 --> 01:56:04.662
<i>Well, that is good
to hear, Counselor.</i>

01:56:10.163 --> 01:56:12.074
What are you saying?

01:56:13.767 --> 01:56:15.838
Are you saying
this is a possibility?

01:56:16.403 --> 01:56:17.848
No.

01:56:18.438 --> 01:56:19.974
It's impossible.

01:56:20.841 --> 01:56:23.151
You said I was that man...

01:56:23.643 --> 01:56:25.020
at that crossing.

01:56:25.178 --> 01:56:28.091
<i>Yes.
At the understanding...</i>

01:56:28.248 --> 01:56:33.197
<i>that life is not
going to take you back.</i>

01:56:34.988 --> 01:56:39.198
<i>You are the world you have created,
and when you cease to exist...</i>

01:56:39.359 --> 01:56:43.466
<i>this world that you have created
will also cease to exist.</i>

01:56:44.130 --> 01:56:46.838
But for those with
the understanding that

01:56:46.967 --> 01:56:49.675
they're living
the last days of the world...

01:56:49.836 --> 01:56:53.978
death acquires
a different meaning.

01:56:55.375 --> 01:56:58.515
The extinction
of all reality...

01:56:58.678 --> 01:57:03.354
is a concept
no resignation can encompass.

01:57:04.784 --> 01:57:08.698
<i>And yet, in that despair,</i>

01:57:08.788 --> 01:57:11.530
<i>which is transcendent,</i>

01:57:12.792 --> 01:57:19.232
you will find the ancient
understanding

01:57:19.332 --> 01:57:25.214
that the philosopher's stone
will always be found despised

01:57:25.305 --> 01:57:26.545
and buried in the mud.

01:57:28.308 --> 01:57:31.755
<i>This may seem a small thing
in the face of annihilation</i>

01:57:31.845 --> 01:57:33.756
<i>until annihilation occurs.</i>

01:57:34.714 --> 01:57:40.164
And then, all the grand designs
and all the grand plans...

01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:45.167
will be finally exposed and
revealed for what they are.

01:57:46.660 --> 01:57:48.697
<i>And now, Counselor,</i>

01:57:48.762 --> 01:57:51.675
<i>I have to go, because I
have to make other calls.</i>

01:57:52.165 --> 01:57:55.738
<i>If I have time,
I think I'll take a small nap.</i>

01:58:06.846 --> 01:58:10.191
<i>Welcome to
London Heathrow, Terminal 5.</i>

01:58:10.350 --> 01:58:13.354
<i>Please keep your bags with you
at all times.</i>

01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:18.128
<i>Any unattended luggage will be
removed and may be destroyed.</i>

01:58:33.640 --> 01:58:34.710
I like the hat.

01:58:34.774 --> 01:58:36.048
Thank you.

01:58:38.945 --> 01:58:41.448
The International.
Of course.

01:58:54.494 --> 01:58:55.495
Hello, madam.

01:58:55.662 --> 01:58:56.800
Hi.

01:58:57.330 --> 01:58:58.570
Checking in?

01:59:02.469 --> 01:59:03.743
How are you doing?

01:59:04.471 --> 01:59:05.506
Okay.

01:59:08.008 --> 01:59:09.078
You're Canadian.

01:59:10.010 --> 01:59:12.923
You saw my passport.
Where are you from?

01:59:13.079 --> 01:59:14.581
New Mexico.

01:59:16.316 --> 01:59:17.351
Have a drink with me.

01:59:17.917 --> 01:59:19.089
What?

01:59:21.755 --> 01:59:23.029
Have a drink with me.

01:59:23.923 --> 01:59:25.197
You're a masher.

01:59:25.358 --> 01:59:28.430
A masher?
Lord, where did you hear that?

01:59:28.595 --> 01:59:30.336
I'm teasing.

01:59:31.264 --> 01:59:32.265
I think.

01:59:50.684 --> 01:59:51.685
No.

01:59:51.785 --> 01:59:52.957
Yes.

02:00:00.527 --> 02:00:04.236
Señor, I must close.

02:00:05.198 --> 02:00:06.302
I know.

02:00:06.466 --> 02:00:08.412
You have no place to go, maybe?

02:00:11.471 --> 02:00:12.882
I fell asleep, I'm sorry.

02:00:13.973 --> 02:00:15.384
There is no harm.

02:00:15.542 --> 02:00:17.146
No harm.

02:00:19.746 --> 02:00:21.748
That's a lovely thought

02:00:23.083 --> 02:00:24.926
A magical thought.

02:00:28.421 --> 02:00:29.729
Good night.

02:00:31.925 --> 02:00:35.930
It's very dangerous out there.
In the street.

02:00:37.731 --> 02:00:39.176
I know.

02:00:40.834 --> 02:00:44.338
If they hear somebody in the
street, they shoot them.

02:00:44.504 --> 02:00:48.452
Then they turn on the light
to see who is dead.

02:00:49.175 --> 02:00:50.518
Why do they do that?

02:00:50.677 --> 02:00:52.020
To make a joke.

02:00:52.278 --> 02:00:57.023
To show that death doesn't care.
That death has no meaning.

02:00:57.517 --> 02:00:58.621
Do you believe that?

02:00:58.852 --> 02:01:00.354
No.

02:01:00.520 --> 02:01:02.761
Of course not.

02:01:02.922 --> 02:01:04.924
All my family is dead.

02:01:05.692 --> 02:01:07.262
I'm the one who has no meaning.

02:03:37.377 --> 02:03:39.084
<i>Please hang up
and try again.</i>

02:03:39.178 --> 02:03:42.455
<i>If you need help, hang up
and dial your operator.</i>

02:04:00.366 --> 02:04:02.368
So, you got the password?

02:04:03.703 --> 02:04:05.046
Five digits.

02:04:05.638 --> 02:04:06.616
Who's Rowena?

02:04:06.706 --> 02:04:07.980
I don't know.

02:04:08.241 --> 02:04:12.155
All right. Social security,
driver's license.

02:04:13.046 --> 02:04:14.923
Can I ask you something?

02:04:15.081 --> 02:04:16.082
Sure.

02:04:16.482 --> 02:04:19.224
I don't see what good this will
do unless you have the computer.

02:04:23.923 --> 02:04:26.164
You and I are square.

02:04:28.561 --> 02:04:30.734
So, are you planning
to see him again?

02:04:31.497 --> 02:04:33.943
What would be the point?
He'll be broke.

02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:35.902
Smart girl.

02:04:37.236 --> 02:04:38.613
Or is it worse than that?

02:04:42.008 --> 02:04:43.888
I don't want to get mixed up
in something heavy.

02:04:43.910 --> 02:04:45.912
You already are.

02:04:46.346 --> 02:04:48.587
How would you know he won't
come looking for you?

02:04:49.082 --> 02:04:50.117
But he won't, will he?

02:04:52.752 --> 02:04:54.129
No.

02:04:54.620 --> 02:04:56.429
He won't

02:04:59.525 --> 02:05:00.936
Jesus.

02:05:08.368 --> 02:05:09.438
Take the money.

02:05:09.535 --> 02:05:11.037
I don't want it.

02:05:11.771 --> 02:05:12.841
Please yourself.

02:05:12.939 --> 02:05:14.111
I have to go.

02:05:14.273 --> 02:05:15.809
You know what I like
about Americans?

02:05:15.975 --> 02:05:17.147
No, what?

02:05:17.944 --> 02:05:19.946
You can depend on them.

02:05:29.389 --> 02:05:31.995
Thank you, Ray.
Okay. Take care.

02:06:49.869 --> 02:06:53.248
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

02:06:54.874 --> 02:06:55.944
Fuck you!

02:06:56.042 --> 02:06:57.043
Drive.

02:08:02.008 --> 02:08:03.180
There you go.

02:08:06.879 --> 02:08:07.949
Drive.

02:08:11.317 --> 02:08:13.695
On my count.
One, two, three.

02:08:35.541 --> 02:08:36.542
<i>Momento!</i>

02:08:48.387 --> 02:08:49.422
Hey.

02:09:50.383 --> 02:09:52.124
Oh, God!

02:10:06.232 --> 02:10:08.178
No!

02:10:30.923 --> 02:10:31.958
Good evening.

02:10:32.024 --> 02:10:33.697
Lovely to see you, madame.
Thank you.

02:10:33.859 --> 02:10:35.770
Good evening, sir.
Follow me.

02:11:04.523 --> 02:11:05.797
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

02:11:11.297 --> 02:11:12.367
It's good to see you.

02:11:12.798 --> 02:11:14.038
You, as well.

02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:16.143
How's Marisa?

02:11:17.903 --> 02:11:19.473
She's fine.

02:11:20.306 --> 02:11:21.808
You should come and see us.

02:11:22.141 --> 02:11:23.313
I know.

02:11:26.879 --> 02:11:28.324
We should talk.

02:11:28.481 --> 02:11:30.324
Yes. Of course.

02:11:30.483 --> 02:11:32.690
We need to move the money
as soon as possible,

02:11:32.818 --> 02:11:35.059
speaking as your banker.

02:11:35.221 --> 02:11:36.501
Are you returning to the States?

02:11:36.655 --> 02:11:40.262
No, and I certainly
can't go to Mexico.

02:11:40.826 --> 02:11:42.669
I'm thinking Hong Kong.
Really?

02:11:42.995 --> 02:11:44.497
Mmm. You don't speak
the language.

02:11:44.563 --> 02:11:45.598
I'm a quick study.

02:11:45.765 --> 02:11:47.767
Well, I suppose you could simply
buy into the market there.

02:11:47.933 --> 02:11:49.844
Yes, it's not a problem.
Cash?

02:11:50.002 --> 02:11:52.573
The easiest way to move cash
is in diamonds.

02:11:52.738 --> 02:11:54.843
You can hold $20 million
in the palm of your hand.

02:11:55.174 --> 02:11:58.087
Well, I suppose there's no problem
selling diamonds in China.

02:11:59.078 --> 02:12:01.615
You can sell diamonds on Mars.

02:12:03.282 --> 02:12:04.522
You need to get out, Michael.

02:12:07.686 --> 02:12:10.189
If anything went wrong,
your name might come up.

02:12:10.356 --> 02:12:11.528
That's right.

02:12:11.690 --> 02:12:13.966
You're not really leaving
me a choice, are you?

02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:16.271
You'll thank me.

02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:22.702
And the cats?

02:12:22.868 --> 02:12:27.374
Silvia died, and Raoul is
alive and well in Arizona.

02:12:28.307 --> 02:12:29.980
I'll miss him.

02:12:31.310 --> 02:12:33.722
I miss watching him
out on the high desert

02:12:33.813 --> 02:12:36.225
bringing down jackrabbits
at 70 miles an hour.

02:12:37.383 --> 02:12:38.885
I never tired of that.

02:12:39.885 --> 02:12:42.889
To see quarry,
killed with elegance...

02:12:43.055 --> 02:12:46.901
it's just... moving to me.

02:12:47.560 --> 02:12:49.233
Is it sexual?

02:12:49.995 --> 02:12:54.466
Yes, of course. A thing
like that is always sexual.

02:12:55.668 --> 02:13:01.016
The hunter has grace, beauty...

02:13:01.173 --> 02:13:04.518
and purity of heart
to be found nowhere else.

02:13:05.144 --> 02:13:09.752
You can make no distinction between
what they are and what they do.

02:13:09.915 --> 02:13:12.088
And what they do is kill.

02:13:13.686 --> 02:13:16.758
We, of course,
are another matter.

02:13:16.922 --> 02:13:20.870
It is our faintness of heart that
has driven us to the edge of ruin.

02:13:22.595 --> 02:13:24.939
Perhaps you won't agree...

02:13:25.931 --> 02:13:28.104
but nothing is
crueler than a coward.

02:13:28.934 --> 02:13:31.278
And the slaughter to come...

02:13:31.437 --> 02:13:33.542
is probably beyond our imagining.

02:13:34.607 --> 02:13:37.850
I think you've told me
more than I wish to know.

02:13:39.044 --> 02:13:40.955
Then I'll say no more.

02:13:42.448 --> 02:13:45.292
Shall we think about ordering?

02:13:46.218 --> 02:13:48.129
I'm famished.
