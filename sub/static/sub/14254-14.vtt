00:08.341 --> 00:09.501
Report.

00:09.576 --> 00:11.407
A ship just de-cloaked
off our port stern.

00:11.478 --> 00:12.775
Can you identify them?

00:12.846 --> 00:14.279
They re-cloaked.

00:15.415 --> 00:16.939
That disruptor blast

00:17.017 --> 00:18.245
had a Klingon signature.

00:19.352 --> 00:20.944
Evasive maneuvers.

00:21.054 --> 00:22.112
Hail them.

00:23.189 --> 00:24.747
No response.

00:31.731 --> 00:33.926
Port shields
are down to 50 percent.

00:35.235 --> 00:36.065
They've re-cloaked again.

00:36.169 --> 00:37.898
The tetryon readings indicate

00:38.004 --> 00:39.596
it's a D7-class cruiser.

00:39.706 --> 00:43.506
D7? They were
retired decades ago.

00:43.576 --> 00:45.510
lf their technology
is antiquated...

00:45.578 --> 00:46.670
Perhaps a metaphasic

00:46.746 --> 00:47.610
scan might be able

00:47.680 --> 00:49.580
to penetrate their cloak.

00:49.649 --> 00:50.616
Do it.

00:50.683 --> 00:52.548
Bridge to Astrometrics.

00:52.619 --> 00:55.087
lnitiate a metaphasic sweep.

00:57.390 --> 00:59.017
l've detected a vessel.

00:59.159 --> 01:01.889
Transferring the trajectory
to Tactical.

01:01.995 --> 01:03.553
l have them.

01:03.630 --> 01:05.427
Fire phasers.

01:11.371 --> 01:13.066
Our cloak has failed.

01:13.173 --> 01:16.939
Divert emergency power
to shields.

01:17.010 --> 01:19.240
Forward emitters are off-line.

01:19.312 --> 01:22.372
The Federation ship
is hailing again.

01:22.449 --> 01:23.643
Answer them.

01:23.716 --> 01:24.944
Captain!

01:25.085 --> 01:26.245
lt may give us more time

01:26.319 --> 01:28.219
to get the cloak
back on line. Visual.

01:29.556 --> 01:31.524
This is Captain Kathryn Janeway

01:31.591 --> 01:33.616
of the Federation
Starship Voyager.

01:33.693 --> 01:34.785
Stand down.

01:34.861 --> 01:37.056
We will not surrender
to sworn enemies

01:37.130 --> 01:38.495
of the Klingon Empire.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:29.742 --> 03:31.937
l think there's been
a misunderstanding.

03:32.078 --> 03:33.875
The Empire signed
a peace treaty

03:33.947 --> 03:36.211
with the Federation
more than 80 years ago.

03:36.282 --> 03:37.579
lf l'm not mistaken,

03:37.650 --> 03:38.947
it's still in effect.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.076
You're lying.

03:40.153 --> 03:43.645
l'm not lying,
but even if l were,

03:43.723 --> 03:45.657
your ship is no match for mine.

03:45.725 --> 03:47.955
l suggest we discuss this.

03:48.027 --> 03:49.517
What is there to talk about?

03:49.596 --> 03:51.928
The treaty, for one thing.

03:51.998 --> 03:53.465
l'll give you access
to our database,

03:53.533 --> 03:55.262
show you l'm
telling the truth.

03:55.368 --> 03:57.928
Databases can be falsified.

03:58.037 --> 04:01.996
l have a Klingon serving
aboard this ship.

04:02.108 --> 04:03.439
lmpossible.

04:03.509 --> 04:05.067
She's my Chief Engineer.

04:05.144 --> 04:09.240
l will meet this Chief Engineer.

04:09.315 --> 04:12.182
We'd be honored
to have you as our guest.

04:16.255 --> 04:19.156
You're safe here;
you have my word.

04:19.225 --> 04:20.851
Forgive me
if l don't find the word

04:20.927 --> 04:22.224
of a human very reassuring.

04:22.295 --> 04:23.819
l'd like to know
what you're doing

04:23.896 --> 04:24.885
in the Delta Quadrant.

04:24.964 --> 04:26.522
l'm not answering
any questions

04:26.599 --> 04:27.964
until l see the Klingon.

04:39.679 --> 04:42.910
Captain Kohlar,
Lieutenant Torres,

04:42.982 --> 04:45.075
our Chief Engineer.

04:45.151 --> 04:48.917
You're with child.

04:48.988 --> 04:51.252
That's what
the Doctor tells me.

04:51.324 --> 04:54.691
Did you conceive during
the holy month of nay'Poq?

04:54.761 --> 04:56.854
l have no idea.

04:56.929 --> 04:59.261
lt would have been
14 or 15 weeks ago.

04:59.332 --> 05:00.822
That sounds about right,

05:00.900 --> 05:03.391
not that it's any
of your business.

05:03.469 --> 05:06.870
l must return to my ship.

05:06.939 --> 05:09.169
Aren't you interested
in learning about the treaty?

05:09.242 --> 05:11.210
Here's a copy
of the Khitomer Accords.

05:11.277 --> 05:12.744
l must return to my vessel.

05:12.812 --> 05:14.211
Not without your assurance

05:14.280 --> 05:16.339
that you won't fire
on my ship again.

05:21.621 --> 05:23.748
You have my word.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.758
Escort Captain Kohlar
back to the Transporter Room.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.491
Aye, Captain.

05:40.239 --> 05:44.107
What the hell was that about?

05:45.545 --> 05:46.944
lt's the truth.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.514
How can you be certain?

05:49.582 --> 05:50.514
The Scrolls say:

05:50.583 --> 05:53.211
''You will find me
after two warring houses

05:53.286 --> 05:54.947
make peace.''

05:55.021 --> 05:57.353
Our people and the Federation,

05:57.423 --> 06:00.950
our greatest enemy,
are at peace.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.825
So the humans claim.

06:03.896 --> 06:06.558
These Accords may be
a deception.

06:06.632 --> 06:08.293
The other signs are present.

06:08.401 --> 06:12.531
''You will know me
before l know the world.''

06:12.638 --> 06:14.663
The child is unborn.

06:14.774 --> 06:16.765
lt does not know the world.

06:16.876 --> 06:19.174
You interpret the Scrolls well.

06:19.245 --> 06:21.873
We must verify the evidence.

06:22.014 --> 06:24.278
Your skepticism darkens
my heart, T'Greth.

06:24.350 --> 06:26.443
What evidence did
our ancestors have

06:26.519 --> 06:28.646
when they began this journey?

06:28.721 --> 06:31.315
Nothing but their faith.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.417
Tell the others to prepare.

06:34.494 --> 06:38.487
The Day of Separation
has arrived.

06:48.107 --> 06:50.905
Captain, the Klingon ship--
its core is breaching.

06:50.977 --> 06:52.410
Red Alert.

06:52.478 --> 06:54.503
Hail them.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.639
l salute you, Captain.

06:56.716 --> 07:00.652
You did more damage to our
vessel than my engineer thought.

07:00.720 --> 07:01.812
We can send over a team

07:01.954 --> 07:04.081
to help you establish
a containment field.

07:04.157 --> 07:05.920
-There isn't time.
-He's right.

07:05.992 --> 07:08.324
Their core is going to breach
in less than 30 seconds.

07:08.394 --> 07:10.453
l'm requesting
emergency transport.

07:10.530 --> 07:11.827
Captain...

07:11.931 --> 07:14.195
their crew complement is 204.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.705
Erect force fields
around the Shuttle Bay.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.001
Transport them there.

07:22.074 --> 07:24.542
Tell your crew to stand by
for evacuation.

07:24.610 --> 07:25.542
Ten seconds.

07:25.611 --> 07:26.635
lf we're still too close

07:26.712 --> 07:28.043
when their core breaches....

07:28.114 --> 07:29.945
Go to warp as soon as their crew
is aboard.

07:31.317 --> 07:32.215
Five...

07:32.285 --> 07:34.583
four, three...

07:34.654 --> 07:36.383
We have them.

07:53.739 --> 07:56.401
You spared us
a dishonorable death.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.943
Sensor logs indicate

07:58.044 --> 08:01.343
that the containment failure
was not caused by our weapons.

08:01.414 --> 08:03.575
You activated
a self-destruct sequence.

08:03.649 --> 08:06.209
lt was the only way
to get us aboard Voyager.

08:06.285 --> 08:07.912
Why was that so important?

08:07.987 --> 08:10.046
lt's our sacred duty

08:10.122 --> 08:11.987
to be here.

08:12.058 --> 08:13.821
l don't understand.

08:13.960 --> 08:16.724
More than 100 years ago,

08:16.796 --> 08:20.459
my great-grandfather
was part of a sect

08:20.533 --> 08:23.525
which believed
the Empire had lost its way.

08:23.603 --> 08:26.333
They discovered a sacred text.

08:26.439 --> 08:28.339
lt told them to embark
on a journey

08:28.407 --> 08:30.272
to a distant region
of the galaxy.

08:30.343 --> 08:34.746
You've been traveling
for four generations?

08:34.813 --> 08:36.679
My people have always known

08:36.749 --> 08:39.650
the voyage would be long
and difficult,

08:39.719 --> 08:42.381
but the Scrolls said
we would be rewarded.

08:44.323 --> 08:45.312
How?

08:45.391 --> 08:48.622
We would find the kuvah'magh,

08:48.694 --> 08:50.662
the savior of our people,

08:50.730 --> 08:54.359
the one who will lead us
to a new Empire.

08:54.433 --> 08:55.798
The Scrolls instruct us

08:55.902 --> 08:57.699
to follow her
wherever she goes.

08:57.803 --> 09:00.397
What does any of this have to do
with Voyager?.

09:00.506 --> 09:07.810
l believe the kuvah'magh is the
unborn child of B'Elanna Torres.

09:07.914 --> 09:09.347
You're joking.

09:09.415 --> 09:13.112
They take their beliefs
very seriously.

09:13.185 --> 09:15.983
Seriously enough to destroy
their own ship?

09:16.055 --> 09:18.046
Couldn't they have
just followed us?

09:18.124 --> 09:21.821
Apparently, their sacred text
told them to cast off

09:21.961 --> 09:25.761
the old ways as soon as
they found this kuvah'magh.

09:25.831 --> 09:27.059
They saw their vessel

09:27.133 --> 09:29.624
as the last vestige
of the corrupt Empire.

09:29.735 --> 09:31.498
l was hoping our daughter
would be special,

09:31.604 --> 09:32.536
but l never dreamed

09:32.605 --> 09:34.232
she'd turn out to be
the Klingon messiah.

09:34.340 --> 09:35.398
This isn't funny.

09:35.508 --> 09:36.566
They might be dangerous.

09:36.676 --> 09:38.871
l mean, and what if they want
to hurt the baby?

09:38.978 --> 09:40.309
To them, your baby's sacred.

09:40.379 --> 09:42.711
lt's unlikely they would do
anything to harm her.

09:42.782 --> 09:43.714
200 Klingons pose

09:43.783 --> 09:45.011
a significant
security threat.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.244
l suggest we keep
them confined

09:46.319 --> 09:47.286
to the Shuttle Bay

09:47.353 --> 09:49.014
until we can find a
suitable home for them.

09:49.088 --> 09:50.885
There are women and children
down there.

09:51.023 --> 09:52.320
We can't just lock them up.

09:52.391 --> 09:53.323
l agree.

09:53.392 --> 09:54.324
Captain...

09:54.393 --> 09:55.883
Assign extra security
to every deck,

09:55.995 --> 09:58.520
and make sure the Klingons know
and abide by the rules.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.828
The Bridge will have
to be off limits.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.094
Engineering as well.

10:02.201 --> 10:03.896
Keep them out
of all restricted areas.

10:04.036 --> 10:06.231
Despite their reverence
for Lieutenant Torres,

10:06.339 --> 10:08.807
she should be assigned
a 24-hour security detail.

10:08.874 --> 10:10.501
Just what l need.

10:10.576 --> 10:12.203
Where are they
going to sleep?

10:12.278 --> 10:14.109
We'll double up in quarters.

10:14.180 --> 10:15.738
l'll ask for volunteers.

10:15.815 --> 10:17.578
l know this isn't going
to be easy,

10:17.650 --> 10:19.948
but until we can find
another place for them,

10:20.052 --> 10:22.850
we should do our best
to make them feel comfortable.

10:22.922 --> 10:24.116
Dismissed.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.109
Captain, you must try the gagh.

10:44.176 --> 10:46.440
l'll pass, thank you,
but l'm glad to see

10:46.512 --> 10:48.810
you're getting into
the spirit of things.

10:48.881 --> 10:51.247
Well, l've been studying
the Klingon database.

10:51.317 --> 10:54.115
They're a fascinating
people; very robust,

10:54.186 --> 10:56.780
and, uh, they certainly
seem to appreciate

10:56.856 --> 10:59.017
my culinary skills.

10:59.091 --> 11:00.888
lt looks like everything's
running smoothly.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.394
Uh, not quite everything.

11:03.462 --> 11:05.657
Some of the Starfleet people

11:05.731 --> 11:07.596
have been complaining...

11:07.667 --> 11:09.532
about the smell.

11:09.635 --> 11:12.297
Personally, l
find it appealing.

11:12.405 --> 11:15.272
A kind of musky aroma.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.309
Maybe we can adjust
the environmental controls

11:17.410 --> 11:19.674
to filter out the musk.

11:19.745 --> 11:21.440
Thief!

11:21.514 --> 11:24.449
Touch my food again,
and l'll kill you!

11:24.517 --> 11:25.950
Okay, everybody relax.

11:26.018 --> 11:27.918
He took gagh from my plate.

11:27.987 --> 11:29.579
lf you don't mind, Ensign,

11:29.655 --> 11:31.782
l've been studying
Klingon etiquette.

11:31.857 --> 11:33.722
You shouldn't quarrel
over food.

11:33.793 --> 11:35.761
Save your strength for battle,

11:35.828 --> 11:38.262
to fight those
who would challenge you.

11:38.330 --> 11:40.560
Take it easy!

11:42.635 --> 11:43.966
That's enough!

11:44.070 --> 11:46.903
You have a fiery spirit.

11:48.607 --> 11:50.734
You will make a worthy mate.

11:53.446 --> 11:54.913
What a day!

11:59.885 --> 12:03.753
l never met a more
ravenous group in my life.

12:03.856 --> 12:07.189
l must have served
over 300 meals.

12:07.226 --> 12:11.253
Mr. Neelix, may l ask
what you're doing here?

12:11.330 --> 12:13.662
We're bunkmates.

12:13.733 --> 12:17.191
There must be some mistake.

12:17.269 --> 12:19.635
No, there's no mistake.

12:19.705 --> 12:21.798
l gave up my quarters
to a Klingon family.

12:21.907 --> 12:24.239
By the time l checked
with Commander Chakotay,

12:24.310 --> 12:26.801
you were the only one
who hadn't been paired up.

12:26.879 --> 12:28.744
You should've consulted me.

12:28.814 --> 12:33.308
We're such close friends,
l knew you wouldn't mind.

12:33.385 --> 12:37.378
Mr. Neelix, as much
as l enjoy your company,

12:37.456 --> 12:40.892
l prefer solitude
in my own quarters.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.428
You don't really want me
to go back there

12:43.496 --> 12:45.987
and tell that family
to get out, do you?

12:48.300 --> 12:50.962
Good, because l promise you

12:51.070 --> 12:54.631
we're going to have fun,
Mr. Vulcan.

12:56.208 --> 13:00.008
l learned
some Klingon drinking songs.

13:02.214 --> 13:03.738
l'll teach them to you.

13:03.816 --> 13:06.410

13:10.790 --> 13:13.554
Ej lM-ta fey DE-ja i...

13:13.626 --> 13:15.093
Paris to Torres.

13:15.161 --> 13:16.753
l'm almost finished.

13:16.829 --> 13:18.421
You said that an hour ago.

13:18.497 --> 13:20.761
l'll be there in a minute,
l promise. Torres out.

13:20.833 --> 13:22.767
Keep an eye on the replicators.

13:22.868 --> 13:24.665
They've already gone down
once today.

13:25.771 --> 13:27.329
lt's her!

13:39.151 --> 13:41.312
When you said,
''Be there in a minute,''

13:41.387 --> 13:42.945
you weren't kidding.

13:43.055 --> 13:46.388
A group of Klingons ambushed me
outside of Engineering.

13:46.458 --> 13:48.653
l decided transporting myself

13:48.727 --> 13:51.491
would be easier
than running the gauntlet.

13:51.564 --> 13:53.964
l'm starting to feel
like a prisoner.

13:54.033 --> 13:57.491
Well, at least you have
a handsome cell mate.

13:57.570 --> 14:00.038
How long do you think
they're going to be on board?

14:00.139 --> 14:03.370
l thought you'd be glad
to have other Klingons around.

14:03.442 --> 14:04.704
You've always told me

14:04.777 --> 14:07.405
how uncomfortable it
is being the only one.

14:07.479 --> 14:09.777
l guess l should be
careful what l wish for.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.612
Maybe you should
talk to some of them--

14:11.684 --> 14:12.776
give them a chance.

14:13.819 --> 14:14.786
Come in.

14:16.021 --> 14:18.421
Captain...

14:18.490 --> 14:20.287
l'm sorry to bother you,
but l need your help.

14:20.359 --> 14:22.327
Ten of the Klingons
have started a hunger strike.

14:22.394 --> 14:24.055
They say they won't eat
until you agree

14:24.129 --> 14:25.756
to meet with their
Council of Elders.

14:25.831 --> 14:27.264
That's ridiculous.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.893
Their faith is obviously
very important to them.

14:30.035 --> 14:32.003
They think l'm
something l'm not.

14:32.104 --> 14:34.766
Just talk to them;
hear what they have to say.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.571
We could be with
these people for a while.

14:38.644 --> 14:40.305
You can't avoid them forever.

14:40.379 --> 14:41.607
l can try.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.580
lf it'll make you
feel any better,

14:43.649 --> 14:45.844
l'll go with you.

14:48.787 --> 14:51.813
mobaR, DoH'lo maj, Qo-vuh'makh.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.951
mobaR, DoH'lo maj,
Qo-vuh'makh.

14:55.060 --> 14:58.223
mobaR, DoH'lo maj, Qo-vuh'makh.

14:58.297 --> 15:01.323
mobaR, DoH'lo maj,
Qo-vuh'makh.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.665
mobaR, DoH'lo maj, Qo-vuh'makh.

15:04.770 --> 15:07.830
mobaR, DoH'lo maj,
Qo-vuh'makh.

15:07.973 --> 15:10.703
mobaR, DoH'lo maj, Qo-vuh'makh.

15:10.776 --> 15:12.073
mobaR...

15:13.646 --> 15:15.807
You honor us
with your presence.

15:17.516 --> 15:20.417
Look at her ridges.

15:20.486 --> 15:22.681
Morak was right.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.588
Your blood is not pure.

15:25.658 --> 15:30.027
No. My father was human.

15:31.997 --> 15:34.090
Couldn't you see this
for yourself?

15:34.166 --> 15:35.497
Yes, but...

15:35.601 --> 15:36.898
Why didn't you tell us?!

15:37.002 --> 15:38.060
lt wasn't important!

15:38.170 --> 15:41.606
Not important?

15:41.707 --> 15:43.368
We destroyed our ship

15:43.442 --> 15:46.240
because you said
she was the mother

15:46.312 --> 15:47.540
of the kuvah'magh.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.478
Show me where it's written

15:49.548 --> 15:52.608
that the kuvah'magh
must have pure Klingon blood.

15:52.685 --> 15:55.586
The prophecy wouldn't lead us
to a mongrel child.

15:55.654 --> 15:58.418
Hey, take it easy.

15:58.490 --> 15:59.787
Who are you?

15:59.858 --> 16:02.827
The father
of that mongrel child.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.930
More human blood.

16:04.997 --> 16:08.524
Your kuvah'magh
isn't even half Klingon.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.659
l've spent my life

16:10.769 --> 16:12.464
interpreting the Scrolls,

16:12.571 --> 16:15.699
and l say that all the signs
of the prophecy are here.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.742
Liar.

16:17.810 --> 16:22.008
You've led us to a false savior.

16:31.323 --> 16:33.086
l told you this
was a mistake.

16:33.158 --> 16:36.025
Lieutenant...
l need your help.

16:36.095 --> 16:37.027
Any more ''help''

16:37.096 --> 16:38.028
from me, and you're going

16:38.097 --> 16:39.359
to have a holy war
on your hands.

16:39.431 --> 16:41.695
That's what
l'm trying to prevent.

16:48.574 --> 16:51.566
My baby's just a baby.

16:51.677 --> 16:52.905
She's not a savior.

16:52.978 --> 16:53.945
Perhaps you're right,

16:54.079 --> 16:57.139
but we must convince
my people that she is.

16:57.216 --> 16:59.047
Why?

16:59.118 --> 17:01.552
We've traveled more
than 30,000 light-years

17:01.653 --> 17:03.848
in search of this savior,

17:03.922 --> 17:08.382
and in more than 100 years,
we've found nothing

17:08.460 --> 17:11.429
except hardship and isolation.

17:11.497 --> 17:14.159
When l saw Lieutenant Torres--

17:14.233 --> 17:16.428
that she was with child--

17:16.535 --> 17:18.469
l didn't know if l was looking

17:18.537 --> 17:21.005
at the mother
of the kuvah'magh or not,

17:21.073 --> 17:23.540
but l did know l was
looking at an opportunity

17:23.642 --> 17:25.337
to end this wasteful journey.

17:25.411 --> 17:27.810
Then you don't believe
in the prophecy?

17:27.880 --> 17:29.074
What l believe

17:29.148 --> 17:31.309
is that my people
have suffered enough.

17:31.383 --> 17:34.045
lf they accept your child
as the kuvah'magh,

17:34.119 --> 17:36.519
you'll hold
great influence over them.

17:36.588 --> 17:38.749
We can find a suitable planet.

17:38.824 --> 17:40.689
You can tell them
it's their new home,

17:40.759 --> 17:42.249
and they'll follow you there.

17:42.327 --> 17:44.727
l'm not going to lie to them.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.628
What's the alternative?

17:46.698 --> 17:49.098
My people
staying aboard your ship,

17:49.201 --> 17:50.759
draining your resources?

17:50.869 --> 17:52.359
l agree with
Lieutenant Torres.

17:52.471 --> 17:54.939
l'm not comfortable
deceiving your people.

17:55.007 --> 17:57.498
Perhaps you won't have to lie
to them to convince them.

17:57.609 --> 17:59.577
What are you suggesting?

17:59.678 --> 18:02.476
lf you
study the Scrolls with me,

18:02.581 --> 18:04.549
we may be able to interpret them

18:04.583 --> 18:07.677
in a way that appears consistent
with the events of your life.

18:07.753 --> 18:09.744
Then we'll bring
those consistencies

18:09.822 --> 18:12.188
to the attention
of the Council.

18:12.257 --> 18:14.817
So... you just

18:14.893 --> 18:16.827
want to stretch
the truth a little?

18:16.929 --> 18:19.989
lt is possible
that the Sacred Scrolls

18:20.065 --> 18:22.795
were scrawled
by a madman in a cave,

18:22.901 --> 18:25.870
or perhaps they really were
divinely inspired.

18:25.971 --> 18:27.871
Either way, they've guided us

18:27.973 --> 18:29.497
for over a century.

18:29.608 --> 18:30.666
lf my people

18:30.776 --> 18:33.404
start to believe
that the Sacred Scrolls

18:33.479 --> 18:37.279
have led them astray,
there may be violence.

18:37.349 --> 18:39.442
ls that a threat?

18:39.518 --> 18:41.452
Merely a fact.

18:41.520 --> 18:44.284
You're doing
everything you can

18:44.356 --> 18:46.483
to get your people home,
Captain.

18:46.558 --> 18:49.755
That's all l'm doing for mine.

18:53.298 --> 18:55.994
lt says, ''The kuvah'magh

18:56.101 --> 19:00.094
will be descended
from a noble house.''

19:00.205 --> 19:02.230
l don't come from one,

19:02.341 --> 19:04.707
and l'm pretty sure
my husband doesn't either.

19:04.776 --> 19:07.040
We all have nobility
in our blood,

19:07.112 --> 19:08.943
if we go back far enough.

19:09.014 --> 19:12.108
So these Scrolls can mean
anything you want them to.

19:12.184 --> 19:15.950
lt is written that the mother
of the kuvah'magh

19:16.021 --> 19:18.012
would be an off-worlder.

19:18.090 --> 19:20.251
Weren't you born

19:20.325 --> 19:21.314
on a Federation colony?

19:21.393 --> 19:23.418
A lot of Klingons
are born off-world.

19:23.495 --> 19:26.658
lt also says that you would've
lived a life of solitude

19:26.732 --> 19:29.292
and endured many hardships.

19:29.401 --> 19:31.096
That's accurate, isn't it?

19:32.938 --> 19:36.806
According to this,
l'm supposed to have won

19:36.875 --> 19:39.708
''a glorious victory against
an army of 10,000 warriors.''

19:39.778 --> 19:41.678
Haven't you?

19:41.747 --> 19:45.478
We haven't even encountered
10,000 warriors...

19:45.551 --> 19:47.519
well, unless
you include the Borg.

19:47.586 --> 19:51.454
Did you help destroy
one of their vessels?

19:51.523 --> 19:52.581
l suppose...

19:52.658 --> 19:56.094
Couldn't that have been
your glorious victory?

19:56.161 --> 19:58.994
l guess so.

19:59.064 --> 20:01.464
Where are the images of Kahless?

20:01.533 --> 20:03.899
Where is your family crest?

20:04.002 --> 20:07.563
They clashed with the carpet.

20:07.673 --> 20:12.269
Don't you honor any
of your people's traditions?

20:12.344 --> 20:14.904
Not really.

20:14.980 --> 20:18.006
There is one tradition
we can honor together.

20:21.954 --> 20:23.444
What are you doing?

20:23.522 --> 20:26.116
lt's midday.

20:26.191 --> 20:29.627
Time to remember the sacrifice
of our ancestors.

20:31.363 --> 20:33.354
Haven't you made
a Plea for the Dead before?

20:33.432 --> 20:35.400
Well, not since l was a child.

20:35.467 --> 20:38.493
The dead can't rest
in Sto-Vo-Kor

20:38.604 --> 20:41.129
if the living
don't honor their memory.

20:44.076 --> 20:47.978
Perhaps there's someone
l can honor on your behalf.

20:48.046 --> 20:51.140
Who did you plead
for as a child?

20:51.216 --> 20:53.013
My grandmother.

20:53.151 --> 20:55.016
She was called...?

20:55.120 --> 20:56.417
L'Naan.

21:00.792 --> 21:03.124
Kahless...

21:03.195 --> 21:07.256
we implore you to
remember those warriors

21:07.332 --> 21:10.529
who have fallen
in your name.

21:10.636 --> 21:15.096
Lift them out of
the cavern of despair

21:15.207 --> 21:19.337
and reveal yourself to them

21:19.411 --> 21:20.537
in all your glory.

21:20.612 --> 21:22.944
Right, ''in all your glory.''

21:23.081 --> 21:28.041
Remember Kolax, son of Amar.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.782
Remember Talij,

21:30.856 --> 21:34.417
daughter of K'Rene.

21:37.029 --> 21:40.123
Remember L'Naan,

21:40.198 --> 21:42.132
daughter of Krelik.

21:57.616 --> 21:59.208
What happened to you?

21:59.284 --> 22:00.842
l cut myself shaving.

22:00.952 --> 22:02.886
ls that a bite mark?

22:02.921 --> 22:04.752
One of the Klingons attacked me.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.620
Did you do something
to provoke him?

22:06.692 --> 22:08.751
Not him, her,

22:08.827 --> 22:11.796
and she wasn't provoked,
she was... aroused.

22:11.863 --> 22:12.887
Ah...

22:12.998 --> 22:14.727
l'm not surprised.

22:14.800 --> 22:16.893
l've studied the section
on Klingon mating rituals

22:17.035 --> 22:18.730
in their cultural database.

22:18.837 --> 22:19.826
Then maybe you can

22:19.938 --> 22:21.906
tell me how to convince
a female twice my size

22:22.040 --> 22:23.735
that l'm not interested.

22:23.809 --> 22:25.333
Hmm, you probably can't.

22:25.444 --> 22:26.502
Great.

22:26.578 --> 22:29.877
As l understand it,
you have two options--

22:29.948 --> 22:33.281
kill her or mate with her.

22:33.352 --> 22:36.219
Since the first option
is clearly unacceptable...

22:36.288 --> 22:37.380
What's this?

22:37.456 --> 22:39.617
Authorization for you to engage
in intimate relations

22:39.691 --> 22:41.158
with a member
of an alien species.

22:41.226 --> 22:44.491
Be sure to get the Captain's
approval as well.

22:44.563 --> 22:49.227
Chief Engineer's Personal Log,
Stardate 54518.2.

22:49.334 --> 22:52.462
l've spent the last two days
reviewing the Sacred Scrolls

22:52.571 --> 22:54.596
in preparation
for my appearance

22:54.706 --> 22:56.264
before the Klingon Council.

22:56.375 --> 22:59.606
Kohlar also suggested l prepare
a few ''colorful stories''

22:59.678 --> 23:01.043
to help win them over.

23:01.146 --> 23:02.875
That's when they
beamed aboard the Flyer,

23:02.914 --> 23:04.643
weapons firing.

23:04.716 --> 23:06.479
Tuvok and Neelix
fought valiantly,

23:06.551 --> 23:08.178
but there were too many Hirogen.

23:08.253 --> 23:14.351
l had to face ten
of their fiercest hunters alone.

23:14.426 --> 23:17.190
ls that how you remember it?

23:17.262 --> 23:20.698
Exaggeration is part
of Klingon custom.

23:20.766 --> 23:21.858
She's doing great.

23:21.933 --> 23:24.333
...were shot out of my hand,
forcing me to take down

23:24.436 --> 23:27.599
the last hunter
in hand-to-hand combat.

23:27.706 --> 23:29.765
lt was a glorious fight.

23:29.875 --> 23:33.504
Your ancestors would be honored.

23:38.717 --> 23:42.118
You tell a good story,

23:42.187 --> 23:44.781
but that's not why you're here.

23:44.856 --> 23:49.452
Some say you are the mother
of the kuvah'magh,

23:49.528 --> 23:50.927
the one who will guide us

23:50.996 --> 23:52.861
to a new homeworld.

23:52.931 --> 23:56.799
Has your unborn child
told you where it is?

24:00.806 --> 24:02.831
The Scrolls say,

24:02.941 --> 24:09.437
''You will follow in my footsteps
before l have made them.''

24:11.550 --> 24:13.780
Yesterday, we changed course

24:13.852 --> 24:18.221
toward a planet
very much like Qo'noS.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.781
So, in a manner of speaking,

24:20.859 --> 24:24.818
you are now following
my child to a new home.

24:26.498 --> 24:29.092
You deliver the words
we want to hear,

24:29.201 --> 24:31.135
but it's Kohlar
who gives them to you.

24:32.871 --> 24:35.271
Are you his puppet
in the bedchamber as well?

24:35.340 --> 24:36.637
Watch it.

24:36.708 --> 24:38.505
That's my wife
you're talking about.

24:38.577 --> 24:40.340
He speaks!

24:40.412 --> 24:41.879
l didn't think you had a tongue.

24:41.947 --> 24:43.539
Leave him out of this.

24:43.615 --> 24:45.845
You see how he hides

24:45.917 --> 24:48.215
behind his female?

24:48.286 --> 24:50.652
lt is also written
that the father

24:50.722 --> 24:55.125
of the kuvah'magh will be
an honorable warrior.

24:55.193 --> 24:58.856
Would an honorable warrior
ever refuse a challenge?

24:58.930 --> 25:01.626
l haven't refused any challenge.

25:01.700 --> 25:05.261
l haven't made one yet.

25:09.574 --> 25:11.667
You and l...

25:13.879 --> 25:16.109
to the death.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.411
Tom...

25:18.483 --> 25:19.848
Stay out of this.

25:21.786 --> 25:23.413
pahtk.

25:29.928 --> 25:31.589
l accept.

25:42.440 --> 25:44.101
What was l supposed to say?

25:44.175 --> 25:45.540
How about ''no''?

25:45.610 --> 25:46.736
Th-they were all watching.

25:46.811 --> 25:48.244
There would have been
a riot if l refused.

25:48.313 --> 25:49.678
So, you're going to
get yourself killed?

25:49.748 --> 25:51.943
What makes you
so sure l'd lose?

25:52.017 --> 25:53.211
Oh, please.

25:53.285 --> 25:54.513
Look, l have no intention

25:54.586 --> 25:56.213
of fighting anyone to the death,

25:56.288 --> 25:57.915
but wasn't the
whole point of this

25:57.989 --> 25:58.956
to get them to believe

25:59.057 --> 26:00.547
that we are the parents
of their savior?

26:00.659 --> 26:01.626
Captain, this has
gone too far.

26:01.660 --> 26:02.649
You've got to
put a stop to it.

26:02.727 --> 26:04.922
l intend to.

26:04.996 --> 26:06.486
Mr. Tuvok.

26:11.436 --> 26:13.927
Gentlemen...

26:14.039 --> 26:15.131
l'm afraid Lieutenant Paris

26:15.240 --> 26:17.174
had no authority
to accept this challenge.

26:17.242 --> 26:19.710
There will be no death
matches aboard my ship.

26:19.778 --> 26:23.179
l told you this pahtk
was not the true father.

26:23.248 --> 26:25.011
Lieutenant Paris
is perfectly willing

26:25.083 --> 26:26.311
to fight you, Mr. T'Greth.

26:26.384 --> 26:28.875
l'm the one preventing him
from doing so.

26:28.954 --> 26:31.582
The father
of the kuvah'magh

26:31.656 --> 26:34.124
wouldn't let a woman
speak for him.

26:34.192 --> 26:36.683
T'Greth...

26:36.761 --> 26:39.662
there is precedent
for an honorable compromise.

26:41.466 --> 26:42.831
A nonlethal bout,

26:42.901 --> 26:44.892
fought with
blunted bat'leths.

26:44.970 --> 26:46.835
The victory goes
to the first warrior

26:46.905 --> 26:49.430
to knock his opponent
to the ground three times.

26:49.541 --> 26:50.565
A coward's rules!

26:50.675 --> 26:52.267
Was the Emperor Mur'Eq
a coward?

26:53.812 --> 26:55.746
He was the one
who instituted these rules

26:55.814 --> 26:58.305
to insure that his warriors
would kill their enemies

26:58.383 --> 26:59.611
and not each other.

27:01.286 --> 27:03.948
lf you agree to these terms...

27:04.022 --> 27:05.250
l'll allow the match.

27:07.058 --> 27:10.050
l'll see you on the field

27:10.128 --> 27:11.322
of battle!

27:15.867 --> 27:18.802
l assume you have a suitable
holodeck training program

27:18.870 --> 27:21.134
for this, Lieutenant?

27:21.206 --> 27:22.639
He'll be ready.

27:22.707 --> 27:24.641
l'll train him myself.

27:32.017 --> 27:35.350
Hi.

27:35.420 --> 27:37.718
Psst! Neelix.

27:39.424 --> 27:40.356
Something wrong, Harry?

27:40.425 --> 27:41.357
Shh!

27:41.426 --> 27:42.358
Have you seen her?

27:42.427 --> 27:43.359
Who?

27:43.428 --> 27:45.453
Uh... that Klingon woman.

27:45.530 --> 27:47.896
The one l got into
a scrape with in the Mess Hall.

27:48.033 --> 27:49.432
Officer Ch'Rega.

27:49.534 --> 27:50.899
That's her.

27:51.036 --> 27:52.128
l haven't seen her today.

27:52.237 --> 27:54.432
She's been following
me everywhere.

27:54.539 --> 27:55.471
Why?

27:55.540 --> 27:56.564
She wants to mate.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.643
Oh!

27:58.710 --> 28:00.109
You're a lucky man.

28:00.211 --> 28:02.577
She's a fine specimen
of Klingon womanhood.

28:02.647 --> 28:05.047
l guess it's
a matter of taste.

28:05.116 --> 28:06.083
You never saw me!

28:06.151 --> 28:08.051
Wait!

28:08.119 --> 28:09.051
l have a better idea.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.054
Neelix, what the hell
are you doing?

28:11.122 --> 28:12.054
Play along.

28:12.123 --> 28:13.715
l'm taking her off your hands.

28:13.792 --> 28:15.316
When l say you're limited

28:15.393 --> 28:18.294
to two servings of brak't,
that's all you get!

28:18.363 --> 28:19.728
Do you understand me, Ensign?

28:19.798 --> 28:21.925
Yes, sir, whatever you say.

28:22.033 --> 28:23.261
l don't think you do.

28:23.368 --> 28:24.835
lf l catch you
eating more than

28:24.936 --> 28:25.868
your share again,

28:25.937 --> 28:27.928
l'll cut it out of your belly.

28:29.340 --> 28:30.034
Run.

28:31.476 --> 28:32.443
Excuse me.

28:32.544 --> 28:35.012
pahtk.

28:52.330 --> 28:53.661
l didn't think you approved

28:53.732 --> 28:55.131
of this kind of competition.

28:55.200 --> 28:58.692
l don't. l'm here
in an official capacity.

28:58.803 --> 28:59.895
Well, you do know
they're fighting

29:00.004 --> 29:00.936
with nonlethal weapons?

29:00.972 --> 29:03.236
You'd be surprised
how much damage

29:03.308 --> 29:04.798
a blunt bat'leth can do.

29:06.444 --> 29:08.036
Warriors, assemble!

29:10.949 --> 29:14.009
Today would be a
very bad day to die.

29:14.085 --> 29:15.211
l'll try to remember that.

29:18.723 --> 29:22.215
Let honor guide you!

29:22.293 --> 29:24.090
tagh!

29:29.134 --> 29:32.570
l see fear in your eyes, human.

29:32.670 --> 29:34.638
The only Klingon l'm afraid of

29:34.739 --> 29:36.764
is my wife after she's worked
a double shift.

30:58.323 --> 31:00.757
lt's begun.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.656
What are you talking about?

31:02.694 --> 31:05.026
He's dying.

31:05.096 --> 31:08.065
Typically, l'm the one to make
that kind of prognosis.

31:08.132 --> 31:09.656
lt's the nehret.

31:09.734 --> 31:10.666
lt kills all of us

31:10.768 --> 31:12.793
who aren't fortunate
enough to die in battle.

31:19.077 --> 31:22.069
lt's a retrovirus
that destroys the cells

31:22.146 --> 31:25.047
by attacking
the cytoplasmic membranes.

31:25.116 --> 31:26.811
Shouldn't our bio-filters
have detected it

31:26.885 --> 31:28.512
when we transported
the Klingons aboard?

31:28.586 --> 31:29.883
This is an insidious virus.

31:29.954 --> 31:31.581
lt lies dormant,

31:31.656 --> 31:34.216
disguising itself
as inert genetic material

31:34.292 --> 31:36.658
until it inexplicably activates.

31:38.263 --> 31:40.390
The nehret always comes
without warning.

31:40.465 --> 31:42.865
l've reviewed my scans
of the other Klingons.

31:42.934 --> 31:44.561
They're all carriers.

31:47.171 --> 31:49.731
Why didn't you tell us
your people had a disease?

31:49.841 --> 31:52.537
We've never thought
of it as a disease.

31:52.610 --> 31:55.443
lt's more like... old age.

31:55.513 --> 31:56.605
ls it contagious?

31:56.681 --> 31:59.047
Only to Klingons.

32:04.789 --> 32:06.654
lf you'd give us some privacy,

32:06.724 --> 32:08.555
l'd like to examine
Lieutenant Torres.

32:08.626 --> 32:10.594
Of course.

32:29.981 --> 32:31.915
The baby, too?

32:31.983 --> 32:34.315
l'm afraid so.

32:38.523 --> 32:40.047
Why am l here?

32:42.126 --> 32:43.855
You're ill.

32:43.928 --> 32:45.259
You collapsed during the fight.

32:48.066 --> 32:49.431
The nehret.

32:49.500 --> 32:50.967
Yes.

32:51.102 --> 32:53.161
Thank you for telling us.

32:53.271 --> 32:55.705
Now my baby and l have it, too.

32:58.443 --> 33:00.343
Where do you think you're going?

33:00.445 --> 33:04.313
To prepare for my
journey to Sto-Vo-Kor.

33:04.382 --> 33:05.781
You should be in Sick Bay.

33:05.850 --> 33:07.818
Can you make me well?

33:07.885 --> 33:08.874
Not at the moment, but...

33:09.020 --> 33:11.352
Then don't deny
me my tradition.

33:29.340 --> 33:33.674
The child is not the kuvah'magh.

33:33.745 --> 33:36.043
But the father accepted
your challenge.

33:36.114 --> 33:37.046
He defeated you!

33:37.115 --> 33:40.607
l was defeated by the nehret!

33:42.020 --> 33:45.456
B'Elanna Torres and her child

33:45.523 --> 33:47.957
will fall victim to it as well.

33:48.092 --> 33:49.559
lmpossible!

33:49.627 --> 33:51.822
They both carry it.

33:51.896 --> 33:53.386
She told me herself.

33:53.464 --> 33:55.329
But the Scrolls say

33:55.400 --> 33:57.891
the kuvah'magh
is younger than old age.

33:57.969 --> 34:02.167
And stronger than sickness.

34:02.240 --> 34:03.605
She cannot be our savior.

34:06.244 --> 34:08.712
We should resume our search.

34:08.780 --> 34:12.011
Kohlar and many
of the others won't agree.

34:12.083 --> 34:13.641
Then we must act alone!

34:15.920 --> 34:17.649
For the good of our people.

34:19.524 --> 34:21.014
How?

34:22.693 --> 34:25.889
We'll wait for
the right moment.

34:25.996 --> 34:28.362
And when it comes...

34:28.433 --> 34:30.628
we'll seize Voyager!

34:41.279 --> 34:43.804
We've identified
two potential colony sites

34:43.880 --> 34:45.507
in the southern hemisphere.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.880
We'll require
topographical scans.

34:47.952 --> 34:49.248
l'll prepare them.

34:52.657 --> 34:55.592
l shouldn't have doubted you.

34:55.659 --> 34:59.426
lt appears the signs
were there all along.

34:59.497 --> 35:04.491
l'll join the survey mission.

35:04.602 --> 35:05.830
You're ill, old friend.

35:05.970 --> 35:07.870
You should remain here.

35:07.972 --> 35:13.569
l want my final days to be
spent in honorable pursuits.

35:13.644 --> 35:17.944
Don't ask me to die
inside these walls.

35:20.751 --> 35:22.719
We transport in one hour.

35:36.434 --> 35:39.665
Your transporters are much
more sophisticated than ours.

35:39.770 --> 35:41.704
l've studied Klingon
transport systems.

35:41.772 --> 35:44.138
The basic technology
isn't all that different.

35:44.208 --> 35:46.642
But you were able
to beam our entire crew

35:46.711 --> 35:48.235
aboard Voyager at one time.

35:48.312 --> 35:50.212
We usually don't like to do that

35:50.281 --> 35:52.272
for safety reasons,
but in a pinch,

35:52.350 --> 35:53.817
we can expand
the buffer capacity.

35:53.885 --> 35:55.352
These are the
targeting scanners?

35:55.419 --> 35:58.718
Exactly. They work on the
same principles as yours.

36:05.763 --> 36:07.025
You said it was urgent?

36:07.098 --> 36:08.190
l need to conduct

36:08.266 --> 36:10.200
a more detailed
bio-scan of your baby.

36:10.301 --> 36:11.529
She's not sick, is she?

36:11.636 --> 36:13.604
No, but l may be onto something.

36:15.640 --> 36:17.835
l'll be leading the team
going to Site A.

36:17.909 --> 36:20.844
Kohlar will be in charge
of the Site B team.

36:20.912 --> 36:22.004
Morning, Commander.

36:22.079 --> 36:23.068
Harry.

36:33.324 --> 36:36.259
Phaser fire
in Transporter Room 1.

36:36.327 --> 36:38.420
Bridge to Chakotay.

36:52.243 --> 36:54.074
They're on the surface.

36:54.145 --> 36:56.773
Now lock on to the
Bridge officers.

36:56.847 --> 36:59.941
They've activated a force field
around Deck 1.

37:00.017 --> 37:02.645
Transport the rest
of their crew.

37:02.687 --> 37:05.155
Captain, l'm detecting
multiple transports.

37:05.189 --> 37:08.488
Some of our people are being
beamed down to the surface.

37:08.559 --> 37:09.821
Cut power to the transporters.

37:12.029 --> 37:13.291
l can't.

37:13.364 --> 37:14.991
Bridge to Engineering.

37:16.033 --> 37:18.194
B'Elanna, respond.

37:18.302 --> 37:20.736
There's no one in Engineering.

37:25.543 --> 37:26.874
The Bridge officers?

37:26.978 --> 37:28.445
l still can't get a lock.

37:29.680 --> 37:32.148
Can you transport us there?

37:32.216 --> 37:33.808
l'll try.

37:41.692 --> 37:44.126
Computer, open
the Transporter Room doors.

37:44.195 --> 37:46.493
Security override:
Tuvok-pi-alpha.

38:27.571 --> 38:30.506
Grant me a warrior's death.

38:32.510 --> 38:34.171
l beg of you.

38:34.245 --> 38:35.507
Sorry.

38:35.579 --> 38:38.275
No mercy killings on my Bridge.

38:41.152 --> 38:42.619
Get our people back.

38:42.687 --> 38:45.212
Yes, ma'am.

39:01.205 --> 39:04.003
Why am l not in Sto-Vo-Kor?.

39:04.075 --> 39:06.202
Because you are
healthy as a targ.

39:07.278 --> 39:09.405
The nehret?

39:09.480 --> 39:10.811
Gone.

39:10.948 --> 39:13.143
We have B'Elanna Torres' child

39:13.217 --> 39:14.946
to thank for it.

39:16.487 --> 39:18.318
The fetus has hybrid stem cells.

39:18.389 --> 39:20.357
They contain Klingon
and human DNA.

39:20.424 --> 39:22.619
l used them
to synthesize an antivirus.

39:22.693 --> 39:27.096
The child... cured me?

39:27.164 --> 39:28.722
Well, l was the one
who devised the treatment.

39:28.799 --> 39:29.823
Doctor...

39:29.967 --> 39:32.765
Yes, of course,
the child cured you.

39:32.870 --> 39:34.462
The kuvah'magh

39:34.572 --> 39:37.006
has healed all of us.

39:37.074 --> 39:40.669
She truly is our savior.

39:49.353 --> 39:53.414
Captain's Log, Stardate 54529.8.

39:53.491 --> 39:56.016
While we're helping the Klingons
into their new home,

39:56.093 --> 39:59.119
life aboard Voyager is gradually
returning to normal.

40:01.866 --> 40:04.130
Computer, open this door.

40:04.235 --> 40:06.897
Access to these quarters
has been restricted.

40:07.071 --> 40:08.538
On whose authority?

40:08.639 --> 40:09.901
Neelix.

40:09.974 --> 40:12.534
Mr. Neelix, open this door.

40:12.610 --> 40:15.078
l'll be there in a minute,
Commander.

40:15.146 --> 40:16.636
That's... that's my boot.

40:16.714 --> 40:18.409
Computer, security override.

40:18.482 --> 40:19.779
Authorization: Tuvok-pi...

40:24.121 --> 40:26.419
Good-bye,
my little par'machkai.

40:26.490 --> 40:28.185
Good-bye, my fearless warrior.

40:28.259 --> 40:29.783
Oh!

40:41.205 --> 40:43.696
l'm really going to miss her.

40:55.486 --> 40:57.852
Oh...

41:00.825 --> 41:03.293
Don't you worry, Mr. Vulcan.

41:04.995 --> 41:07.896
l'll have this place...

41:07.998 --> 41:10.899
shipshape in no time at all.

41:12.970 --> 41:15.598
Just... go, Mr. Neelix.

41:24.148 --> 41:25.376
What's this?

41:25.449 --> 41:27.417
The bat'leth given to me

41:27.485 --> 41:28.952
by my great-grandfather.

41:29.019 --> 41:30.452
lt's for your daughter.

41:32.223 --> 41:35.784
l hope someday
you'll tell her about us.

41:37.361 --> 41:39.261
l will.

41:49.473 --> 41:51.941
Qapla', B'Elanna Torres.

41:52.042 --> 41:54.510
Qapla'.

42:03.254 --> 42:04.551
lt doesn't seem right

42:04.622 --> 42:06.317
just to hang it on the wall.

42:06.390 --> 42:09.325
l'm not letting you
scratch it up on the holodeck.

42:09.393 --> 42:11.020
l'm sure our daughter

42:11.095 --> 42:13.791
wouldn't mind lending it
to the old man

42:13.864 --> 42:15.195
every now and then.

42:15.266 --> 42:19.828
You know, this is one special
kid we're going to have.

42:19.937 --> 42:22.405
You're just figuring that out?

42:22.506 --> 42:25.270
Well, l was hoping
for an artist,

42:25.342 --> 42:27.071
or maybe a musician.

42:27.144 --> 42:32.138
But she's already the
savior of an entire race.

42:32.216 --> 42:34.343
You don't really believe that.

42:34.418 --> 42:35.680
l don't know.

42:35.753 --> 42:38.449
There are a lot
of coincidences to explain.

42:38.522 --> 42:39.580
l mean, what were the odds

42:39.657 --> 42:40.954
that they'd run
into the one ship

42:41.058 --> 42:42.889
in the whole Quadrant
with a Klingon aboard?

42:42.960 --> 42:44.757
Probably about the same odds

42:44.828 --> 42:46.955
that you and l
would get married.

42:48.365 --> 42:51.061
Maybe we should
name her kuvah'magh...

42:52.636 --> 42:54.126
Just to be safe.

42:57.841 --> 42:59.809
Put it on the list.
