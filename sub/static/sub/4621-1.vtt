02:06.392 --> 02:08.226
She isn't coming yet, Toto.

02:08.394 --> 02:09.895
Did she hurt you?

02:10.062 --> 02:11.855
She tried to, didn't she?

02:12.023 --> 02:15.317
Come on. We'll go tell Uncle Henry
and Auntie Em. Come on, Toto.

02:23.618 --> 02:26.661
Aunt Em! Aunt Em!

02:26.871 --> 02:29.289
Just listen to what Miss Gulch
did to Toto...

02:29.457 --> 02:31.291
Dorothy, please. We're counting.

02:31.459 --> 02:34.211
- But she hit him...
- Don't bother us now, honey.

02:34.379 --> 02:39.216
The incubator's gone bad and
we're likely to lose a lot of our chicks.

02:39.384 --> 02:41.134
Oh, that poor little thing.

02:41.302 --> 02:44.011
But Miss Gulch hit Toto with a rake...

02:44.179 --> 02:47.640
...because she says he chases
her nasty old cat every day!

02:47.808 --> 02:49.975
- Seventy. Dorothy, please!

02:50.143 --> 02:53.312
But he doesn't do it every day!
Just once or twice a week.

02:53.480 --> 02:55.356
He can't catch her old cat anyway.

02:55.524 --> 02:59.777
- And now she says she's gonna...
- Dorothy. Dorothy, we're busy.

03:01.530 --> 03:03.531
Oh, all right.

03:06.743 --> 03:08.869
How's she coming?
Take it easy.

03:09.079 --> 03:10.371
Ow!

03:10.539 --> 03:11.956
You got my finger!

03:12.124 --> 03:14.125
Get your finger out of the way.

03:14.876 --> 03:17.253
There you are.
Right on my finger!

03:17.421 --> 03:18.879
Lucky it wasn't your head.

03:19.047 --> 03:22.758
Zeke, what am I gonna do about
Miss Gulch? Just because Toto...

03:22.926 --> 03:25.428
Listen, honey,
I got them hogs to get in.

03:25.595 --> 03:29.723
Dorothy, you ain't using your head.
You'd think you didn't have any brains.

03:29.891 --> 03:32.852
- I have so got brains.
- Well, why don't you use them?

03:33.019 --> 03:35.020
Don't go by Miss Gulch's place.

03:35.188 --> 03:39.066
Then Toto won't get in her garden,
and you won't get in no trouble, see?

03:39.234 --> 03:42.153
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen,
that's all.

03:42.320 --> 03:45.614
Well, your head ain't made of straw,
you know.

03:47.576 --> 03:51.954
Say, get in there before I make
a dime bank out of you.

03:54.166 --> 03:56.249
Listen, kid...

03:56.917 --> 04:00.545
...are you gonna let that old Gulch
heifer try and buffalo you?

04:00.754 --> 04:03.965
She ain't nothing to be afraid of.
Have a little courage.

04:04.133 --> 04:05.633
I'm not afraid of her.

04:05.801 --> 04:08.678
Next time she squawks,
walk up to her and spit in her eye.

04:09.096 --> 04:12.348
- That's what I'd do.
- Oh! Oh!

04:12.516 --> 04:14.309
Oh! Zeke!

04:14.477 --> 04:17.437
Help! Help me, Zeke!
Get me out of here!

04:17.605 --> 04:19.355
Help!

04:19.523 --> 04:21.107
Oh! Oh!

04:21.274 --> 04:24.569
Are you all right, Dorothy?
- Yes, I'm all right.

04:24.737 --> 04:27.739
I fell in, and Zeke...

04:29.074 --> 04:32.076
Why, Zeke, you're just
as scared as I am.

04:32.244 --> 04:35.246
You gonna let a little old pig
make a coward out of you?

04:35.414 --> 04:36.456
Look at you...

04:36.624 --> 04:39.709
What's all this jabber-wapping
when there's work to be done?

04:39.877 --> 04:42.879
I know three farm hands
that'll be out of a job.

04:43.047 --> 04:44.088
Dorothy was...

04:44.256 --> 04:46.424
I saw you tinkering
with that contraption.

04:46.592 --> 04:49.219
- You and Hunk get back to that wagon.
All right.

04:49.386 --> 04:51.804
But someday they'll erect
a statue to me...

04:51.972 --> 04:54.641
Well, don't start posing for it now.

04:54.808 --> 04:57.227
Can't work on an empty stomach.
Have some crullers.

04:57.394 --> 04:59.521
Gosh, Mrs. Gale.
Just fried.

04:59.688 --> 05:01.606
You see, Dorothy toppled into the...

05:01.815 --> 05:03.983
It's no place for Dorothy
around a pigsty!

05:04.235 --> 05:06.861
Feed those hogs before they
worry themselves into anemia!

05:07.029 --> 05:08.362
- Yes.
- Auntie Em...

05:08.530 --> 05:11.823
...you know what Miss Gulch
said she was going to do to Toto?

05:12.075 --> 05:14.660
- She said she'd...
Stop imagining things.

05:14.827 --> 05:18.789
You always get in a fret over nothing.
You just help us out today...

05:18.957 --> 05:22.709
...and find yourself a place where
you won't get into any trouble.

05:25.004 --> 05:27.839
Someplace where there
isn't any trouble.

05:28.675 --> 05:31.760
Do you suppose there is
such a place, Toto?

05:32.345 --> 05:34.471
There must be.

05:35.807 --> 05:40.352
It's not a place you can get to
by a boat or a train.

05:41.229 --> 05:44.523
It's far, far away.

05:44.816 --> 05:47.150
Behind the moon...

05:47.443 --> 05:49.444
...beyond the rain...

05:49.904 --> 05:56.118
Somewhere over the rainbow

05:56.286 --> 06:01.331
Way up high

06:01.499 --> 06:06.336
There's a land that I heard of

06:06.504 --> 06:11.633
Once in a lullaby

06:11.801 --> 06:18.015
Somewhere over the rainbow

06:18.182 --> 06:23.019
Skies are blue

06:23.186 --> 06:28.649
And the dreams that you dare to dream

06:28.817 --> 06:33.070
Really do come true

06:33.655 --> 06:37.658
Someday I'll wish upon a star

06:37.826 --> 06:44.707
And wake up where the clouds
Are far behind me

06:46.168 --> 06:48.753
Where troubles melt like lemon drops

06:48.920 --> 06:51.714
Away above the chimney tops

06:51.882 --> 06:54.884
That's where you'll...

06:55.052 --> 07:00.973
...find me

07:01.141 --> 07:07.355
Somewhere over the rainbow

07:07.522 --> 07:12.777
Bluebirds fly

07:12.944 --> 07:19.033
Birds fly over the rainbow

07:19.201 --> 07:22.036
Why then...

07:22.204 --> 07:29.001
...oh, why can't I?

07:38.844 --> 07:42.389
If happy little bluebirds fly

07:42.556 --> 07:45.684
Beyond the rainbow

07:45.851 --> 07:48.937
Why, oh, why...

07:49.105 --> 07:55.777
...can't I?

08:17.258 --> 08:20.677
Mr. Gale.
Howdy, Miss Gulch.

08:20.928 --> 08:23.805
I want to see you and your wife
about Dorothy.

08:23.973 --> 08:26.266
- What has Dorothy done?
- What's she done?

08:26.434 --> 08:28.768
I'm all but lame from
the bite on my leg!

08:28.936 --> 08:31.604
- You mean, she bit you?
- No, her dog!

08:31.772 --> 08:35.482
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?

08:35.860 --> 08:37.693
No.

08:38.486 --> 08:42.157
That dog's a menace. I'm taking him
to make sure he's destroyed.

08:42.323 --> 08:44.576
Destroyed! Toto?

08:44.744 --> 08:46.618
Oh, you can't! You mustn't!

08:46.786 --> 08:49.872
Auntie Em! Uncle Henry!
You won't let her, will you?

08:50.039 --> 08:51.874
Of course we won't.

08:52.125 --> 08:53.459
Uh, will we, Em?

08:53.626 --> 08:55.127
Please, Aunt Em!

08:55.295 --> 08:57.755
Toto didn't know he was
doing anything wrong.

08:57.922 --> 09:02.468
I'm the one that ought to be punished.
Send me to bed without supper.

09:02.635 --> 09:05.637
Hand over that dog or I'll bring
a suit that'll take your farm!

09:05.805 --> 09:08.015
The law protects folks
against dogs that bite!

09:08.183 --> 09:10.809
How about if she keeps him tied up?
He's gentle.

09:10.977 --> 09:14.688
- With gentle people, that is.
- That's for the sheriff to decide.

09:14.856 --> 09:19.359
This order allows me to take him.
Unless you wanna go against the law.

09:19.819 --> 09:23.030
Hm. Yes.

09:23.198 --> 09:26.533
We can't go against the law.
I'm afraid poor Toto has to go.

09:26.701 --> 09:28.160
- Now you're seeing reason.
- No.

09:28.369 --> 09:31.288
Here's what I'm taking him in,
so he can't attack me again.

09:31.456 --> 09:33.624
No, No! I won't let you take him!

09:33.792 --> 09:37.211
- You go away or I'll bite you myself!
Dorothy!

09:37.378 --> 09:41.507
You wicked old witch! Uncle Henry,
Auntie Em, don't let her take Toto.

09:41.674 --> 09:42.966
I've got an order!

09:43.134 --> 09:44.510
- Let me have him!
- Please stop!

09:44.677 --> 09:46.178
Put him in the basket, Henry.

09:46.346 --> 09:48.388
- The idea!
- Don't, Uncle Henry.

09:50.892 --> 09:52.726
Oh, Toto!

10:02.945 --> 10:05.988
Almira Gulch, just because
you own half the county...

10:06.156 --> 10:08.449
...doesn't mean you can
run the rest of us!

10:08.617 --> 10:11.828
For 23 years I've been dying
to tell you what I thought of you!

10:11.995 --> 10:13.079
And now...

10:13.247 --> 10:16.749
Well, being a Christian woman,
I can't say it!

10:42.025 --> 10:43.484
Toto, darling!

10:43.652 --> 10:47.697
Oh, I got you back!
You came back!

10:47.865 --> 10:50.533
I'm so glad!

10:53.996 --> 10:56.789
They'll be coming back
for you in a minute.

10:57.875 --> 10:59.750
We've got to get away!

10:59.918 --> 11:02.044
We've got to run away!

11:36.871 --> 11:39.289
Well, well, well! Houseguests, eh?

11:40.875 --> 11:42.250
And who might you be?

11:42.460 --> 11:44.127
No, no. Now, don't tell me.

11:45.171 --> 11:47.130
Let's see. You're...

11:47.298 --> 11:48.924
You're traveling in disguise.

11:49.091 --> 11:51.801
No, that's not right. You're...

11:51.969 --> 11:53.511
You're going on a visit.

11:53.679 --> 11:55.764
No, I'm wrong. Let's see what we...

11:55.932 --> 11:58.433
You're... You're running away.

11:58.601 --> 12:00.185
How did you guess?

12:00.353 --> 12:02.771
Professor Marvel never guesses,
he knows.

12:02.939 --> 12:06.942
Now, why are you running away?
No, no. Now, don't tell me.

12:07.109 --> 12:10.487
They... They don't understand you
at home. They don't appreciate you.

12:10.655 --> 12:14.783
You want to see other lands.
Big cities, big mountains, big oceans.

12:14.951 --> 12:17.786
Why, it's just like you could
read what was inside of me.

12:19.538 --> 12:22.207
Toto, that's not polite!
We haven't been asked yet.

12:22.416 --> 12:25.209
Oh, he's perfectly welcome.

12:25.377 --> 12:28.170
As one dog to another, huh?

12:28.588 --> 12:30.381
Now, let's see, where were we?

12:30.590 --> 12:34.426
Why can't we go with you and
see all the crowned heads of Europe?

12:34.594 --> 12:37.513
Do you know any?
Oh, you mean the thing. Yes.

12:37.681 --> 12:42.351
Well, uh, I never do anything without
consulting my crystal first.

12:42.519 --> 12:46.814
Let's go inside here. We'll...
Just come along. I'll show you.

12:47.148 --> 12:51.568
That's right. Here.
Sit right down here. That's it.

12:51.736 --> 12:56.740
This is the same genuine,
magic, authentic crystal...

12:56.908 --> 13:01.787
...used by the priests of Isis and
Osiris in the days of the Pharaohs...

13:01.955 --> 13:07.001
...in which Cleopatra saw the approach
of Julius Caesar and Marc Anthony.

13:07.168 --> 13:10.129
And so on, and so on. Now...

13:10.296 --> 13:13.507
...you'd better close your eyes,
my child, for a moment...

13:13.675 --> 13:18.846
...in order to be better in tuned
with the Infinite.

13:19.806 --> 13:24.393
We can't do these things without
reaching out into the Infinite.

13:24.561 --> 13:27.229
Yes, that's all right.
Now you can open them.

13:27.397 --> 13:30.441
We'll gaze into the crystal.

13:30.608 --> 13:32.026
Ah.

13:32.193 --> 13:35.945
What's this I see?
A house with a picket fence...

13:36.113 --> 13:39.282
...and a barn with a weathervane...

13:39.575 --> 13:41.659
...of a running horse.

13:41.827 --> 13:43.911
- That's our farm!
- Yes.

13:44.079 --> 13:46.664
Yes. There's a woman.

13:46.832 --> 13:51.669
She's wearing a polka-dot dress.
Her face is careworn.

13:51.837 --> 13:53.296
That's Aunt Em.

13:53.464 --> 13:55.506
Yes. Her name is Emily.

13:55.674 --> 13:57.925
That's right. What's she doing?

13:58.093 --> 14:00.636
Well, I can't quite see.

14:00.804 --> 14:03.848
Why, she's crying.
Someone has hurt her.

14:04.016 --> 14:07.018
Someone has just about
broken her heart.

14:07.186 --> 14:08.227
Me?

14:08.520 --> 14:11.397
Well, it's... It's someone
she loves very much.

14:11.565 --> 14:13.649
Someone she's been very kind to.

14:13.817 --> 14:16.069
Someone she's taken care of
in sickness.

14:16.570 --> 14:20.531
I had the measles once, and she stayed
right by me every minute.

14:20.699 --> 14:21.824
Uh-huh.

14:21.992 --> 14:23.826
What's she doing now?

14:23.994 --> 14:26.496
Yes, she's... What's this?

14:26.663 --> 14:29.707
Why, she's putting her hand
on her heart!

14:29.875 --> 14:33.169
- She's dropping down on the bed.
- Oh, no, no!

14:33.337 --> 14:36.964
Well, that's all.
The crystal's gone dark.

14:37.132 --> 14:39.967
You don't suppose she could
really be sick, do you?

14:40.135 --> 14:43.971
- Oh, I've gotta go home right away.
- I thought you were going with me.

14:44.139 --> 14:46.432
No, I have to get to her right away!

14:46.600 --> 14:48.725
Come on, Toto! Come on!

14:50.728 --> 14:54.231
Goodbye, Professor Marvel.
And thanks a lot!

14:56.359 --> 14:59.319
Better get under cover, Sylvester.
A storm's blowing up.

14:59.487 --> 15:02.739
A whopper, to speak in
the vernacular of the peasantry.

15:02.907 --> 15:06.118
Poor little kid.
I hope she gets home all right.

15:15.002 --> 15:16.503
Get them horses loose!

15:16.671 --> 15:19.798
Where's Hickory? Hickory?

15:19.966 --> 15:21.842
Doggone it!

15:23.302 --> 15:26.388
It's a twister! It's a twister!

15:32.937 --> 15:41.027
Dorothy!

15:51.747 --> 15:53.915
Everybody in the storm cellar!

16:03.300 --> 16:06.468
Henry, I can't find Dorothy!
She's out in the storm!

16:06.636 --> 16:08.554
We can't look for her now.

16:08.722 --> 16:11.390
Come on, get in the cellar!
Hurry up!

16:36.041 --> 16:37.791
Auntie Em!

16:38.501 --> 16:40.419
Auntie Em?

16:42.172 --> 16:43.923
Auntie Em!

16:52.390 --> 16:55.559
Auntie Em! Uncle Henry!

17:04.611 --> 17:05.944
Auntie Em!

18:14.221 --> 18:16.764
We must be up inside the cyclone!

18:19.852 --> 18:22.770
Oh! Miss Gulch!

19:00.933 --> 19:02.351
Oh!

20:49.583 --> 20:51.166
Toto...

20:51.625 --> 20:55.086
...I have a feeling we're not
in Kansas anymore.

21:04.805 --> 21:07.599
We must be over the rainbow!

21:37.129 --> 21:40.006
Now I know we're not in Kansas.

21:42.468 --> 21:45.887
Are you a good witch or a bad witch?

21:46.847 --> 21:48.181
Who, me?

21:48.349 --> 21:50.433
Why, I'm not a witch at all.

21:50.601 --> 21:53.520
- I'm Dorothy Gale, from Kansas.
- Oh.

21:53.771 --> 21:55.480
Well, is that the witch?

21:55.648 --> 21:58.816
Who, Toto? Toto's my dog.

21:58.984 --> 22:02.237
I'm a little muddled. The Munchkins
called me because a new witch...

22:02.488 --> 22:05.239
...just dropped a house on
the Wicked Witch of the East.

22:05.406 --> 22:07.824
And there's the house,
and here you are...

22:07.992 --> 22:11.036
...and that's all that's left
of the Wicked Witch of the East.

22:12.330 --> 22:17.334
What the Munchkins want to know is,
are you a good witch or a bad witch?

22:17.502 --> 22:20.087
But I've already told you,
I'm not a witch at all.

22:20.255 --> 22:22.047
Witches are old and ugly.

22:24.551 --> 22:25.676
What was that?

22:25.885 --> 22:29.429
The Munchkins. They're laughing
because I am a witch.

22:29.597 --> 22:31.848
I'm Glinda, the Witch of the North.

22:32.225 --> 22:33.892
You are?

22:34.060 --> 22:35.519
Oh, I beg your pardon!

22:35.687 --> 22:38.939
But I've never heard
of a beautiful witch before.

22:39.107 --> 22:41.567
Only bad witches are ugly.

22:41.776 --> 22:44.236
The Munchkins are happy
because you freed them...

22:44.404 --> 22:48.240
...from the Wicked Witch of the East.
- But if you please, what are Munchkins?

22:49.617 --> 22:52.202
The little people who live here.
It's Munchkinland...

22:52.370 --> 22:54.955
...and you are their national heroine,
my dear.

22:55.123 --> 22:59.167
It's all right.
You may all come out and thank her.

22:59.502 --> 23:03.589
Come out, come out
Wherever you are

23:03.756 --> 23:09.970
And meet the young lady
Who fell from a star

23:12.765 --> 23:17.059
She fell from the sky
She fell very far

23:17.227 --> 23:22.231
And Kansas, she says
Is the name of the star

23:22.441 --> 23:25.026
Kansas, she says

23:25.193 --> 23:26.777
Is the name of the star

23:29.948 --> 23:32.074
She brings you good news

23:32.242 --> 23:34.577
Or haven't you heard?

23:34.745 --> 23:37.913
When she fell out of Kansas

23:38.081 --> 23:41.959
A miracle occurred

23:44.087 --> 23:47.131
It really was no miracle
What happened was just this

23:47.299 --> 23:50.593
The wind began to switch
The house to pitch

23:50.761 --> 23:54.013
And suddenly the hinges
Started to unhitch

23:54.181 --> 23:57.516
Just then the Witch
To satisfy an itch

23:57.684 --> 24:01.020
Went flying on her broomstick
Thumbing for a hitch

24:01.188 --> 24:04.482
And oh, what happened then was rich

24:04.650 --> 24:06.651
The house began to pitch

24:06.818 --> 24:08.235
The kitchen took a slitch

24:08.445 --> 24:11.072
It landed on the Wicked Witch
In the middle of a ditch

24:11.239 --> 24:16.494
Which was not a healthy situation
For the Wicked Witch

24:16.703 --> 24:19.538
The house began to pitch
The kitchen took a slitch

24:19.706 --> 24:22.625
It landed on the Wicked Witch
In the middle of a ditch

24:22.793 --> 24:27.463
Which was not a healthy situation
For the Wicked Witch

24:27.631 --> 24:31.883
Who began to twitch
And was reduced to just a stitch

24:32.051 --> 24:36.221
Of what was once the Wicked Witch

24:42.186 --> 24:44.354
We thank you very sweetly

24:44.522 --> 24:46.773
For doing it so neatly

24:46.941 --> 24:49.484
You've killed her so completely

24:49.652 --> 24:53.071
That we thank you very sweetly

24:53.572 --> 24:58.785
Let the joyous news be spread!
The Wicked Old Witch at last is dead!

25:02.039 --> 25:04.207
Ding-Dong! The Witch is dead

25:04.375 --> 25:05.875
Which old witch? The Wicked Witch

25:06.043 --> 25:09.587
Ding-Dong! The Wicked Witch is dead

25:09.755 --> 25:13.425
Wake up, you sleepyhead
Rub your eyes, get out of bed

25:13.592 --> 25:16.928
Wake up, the Wicked Witch is dead

25:17.096 --> 25:20.765
She's gone where the goblins go
Below, below, below

25:20.933 --> 25:24.769
Yo-ho! Let's open up and sing
And ring the bells out

25:24.937 --> 25:28.356
Ding-Dong! The merry-o
Sing it high, sing it low

25:28.858 --> 25:32.694
Let them know
The Wicked Witch is dead

25:52.714 --> 25:56.216
As mayor of the Munchkin City

25:56.384 --> 25:59.720
In the county of the Land of Oz

25:59.888 --> 26:03.307
I welcome you most regally

26:03.475 --> 26:06.769
But we've got to verify it legally

26:06.936 --> 26:08.437
- To see
- To see?

26:08.605 --> 26:10.105
- If she
- If she?

26:10.273 --> 26:12.149
Is morally, ethically

26:12.317 --> 26:15.402
- Spiritually, physically
- Positively, absolutely

26:15.570 --> 26:21.158
Undeniably and reliably dead

26:27.624 --> 26:30.584
As coroner I must aver

26:30.752 --> 26:33.545
I thoroughly examined her

26:33.713 --> 26:36.590
And she's not only merely dead

26:36.758 --> 26:40.177
She's really most sincerely dead

26:42.555 --> 26:44.598
Then this is a Day of Independence...

26:44.766 --> 26:47.476
...for all the Munchkins
and their descendants.

26:47.644 --> 26:48.685
If any!

26:48.853 --> 26:54.315
Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
The Wicked Old Witch at last is dead!

26:54.483 --> 26:56.651
Ding-Dong! The Witch is dead

26:56.819 --> 26:58.319
Which old witch? The Wicked Witch

26:58.487 --> 27:01.656
Ding-Dong! The Wicked Witch is dead

27:01.824 --> 27:05.159
Wake up, you sleepyhead
Rub your eyes, get out of bed

27:05.327 --> 27:08.621
Wake up
The Wicked Witch is dead

27:08.789 --> 27:12.124
She's gone where the goblins go
Below, below, below

27:12.292 --> 27:16.045
Yo-ho! Let's open up and sing
And ring the bells out

27:16.213 --> 27:19.674
Ding-Dong! The merry-o
Sing it high, sing it low

27:19.842 --> 27:23.553
Let them know the Wicked Witch is dead

27:47.452 --> 27:50.705
We represent the Lullaby League

27:50.873 --> 27:53.916
The Lullaby League
The Lullaby League

27:54.084 --> 27:58.713
And in the name of the Lullaby League

27:58.881 --> 28:03.092
We wish to welcome you
To Munchkinland

28:12.268 --> 28:15.478
We represent the Lollipop Guild

28:15.646 --> 28:18.940
The Lollipop Guild
The Lollipop Guild

28:19.108 --> 28:23.236
And in the name of the Lollipop Guild

28:23.446 --> 28:28.533
We wish to welcome you
To Munchkinland

28:29.660 --> 28:32.162
We welcome you to Munchkinland

28:32.330 --> 28:35.540
Tra-la-la-la-la-la
Tra-la-la, tra-la-la

28:37.084 --> 28:39.085
Tra-la-la-la-la
La-la

28:39.253 --> 28:41.338
From now on you'll be history

28:41.505 --> 28:43.798
- You'll be his...
- You'll be history

28:43.966 --> 28:47.969
And we will glorify your name

28:48.137 --> 28:49.596
- You will be a bust
- Be a bust

28:49.764 --> 28:53.016
- Be a bust
- In the hall of fame

28:53.351 --> 28:55.018
Tra-la-la-la-la-la
Tra-la-la, tra-la-la

28:55.186 --> 28:57.187
Tra-la-la-la-la
La-la

28:57.355 --> 28:59.314
Tra-la-la-la-la-la
Tra-la-la, tra-la-la

28:59.482 --> 29:01.524
Tra-la-la-la-la
La-la

29:01.692 --> 29:03.777
Tra-la-la-la-la-la
Tra-la-la, tra-la-la

29:03.945 --> 29:06.821
Tra-la-la-la-la
La...

29:22.629 --> 29:24.296
I thought you said she was dead.

29:24.464 --> 29:26.966
That was her sister,
the Wicked Witch of the East.

29:27.133 --> 29:31.095
This is the Wicked Witch of the West.
She's worse than the other one was.

29:31.262 --> 29:35.099
Who killed my sister?
Who killed the Witch of the East?

29:35.266 --> 29:36.725
Was it you?

29:36.935 --> 29:40.938
No. No, it was an accident.
I didn't mean to kill anybody.

29:41.106 --> 29:44.525
Well, my little pretty,
I can cause accidents too!

29:44.693 --> 29:48.153
- Aren't you forgetting the ruby slippers?
- The slippers. Yes!

29:48.863 --> 29:51.115
The slippers!

29:57.831 --> 29:58.872
They're gone!

29:59.124 --> 30:01.500
The ruby slippers!
What have you done with them?

30:01.668 --> 30:03.377
Give them back to me or I'll...

30:03.545 --> 30:07.089
It's too late! There they are,
and there they'll stay!

30:11.219 --> 30:14.555
Give me back my slippers!
Only I know how to use them.

30:14.723 --> 30:18.267
They're of no use to you.
Give them back to me. Give them back!

30:18.435 --> 30:21.311
Keep tight inside of them.
Their magic must be powerful...

30:21.479 --> 30:23.439
...or she wouldn't want them so badly.

30:23.648 --> 30:26.066
Stay out of this, Glinda,
or I'll fix you as well!

30:26.234 --> 30:28.444
Oh, rubbish!
You have no power here.

30:28.611 --> 30:31.738
Begone, before somebody
drops a house on you too.

30:31.905 --> 30:34.866
Very well. I'll bide my time.

30:35.034 --> 30:39.996
And as for you, it's true I can't
attend to you here and now as I'd like.

30:40.164 --> 30:42.582
But just try to stay out of my way!

30:42.791 --> 30:43.875
Just try!

30:44.043 --> 30:45.960
I'll get you, my pretty...

30:46.128 --> 30:48.379
...and your little dog too!

30:59.183 --> 31:01.517
It's all right. You can get up.
She's gone!

31:02.311 --> 31:05.938
It's all right. You can all get up.

31:06.315 --> 31:07.774
Oh! What a smell of sulfur!

31:08.025 --> 31:11.194
I'm afraid you've made an enemy
of the Wicked Witch.

31:11.361 --> 31:15.615
The sooner you get out of Oz altogether,
the safer you'll sleep, my dear.

31:15.783 --> 31:18.910
Oh, I'd give anything
to get out of Oz altogether.

31:19.078 --> 31:23.122
But which is the way back to Kansas?
I can't go the way I came.

31:23.290 --> 31:26.334
No, that's true.
The only person who might know...

31:26.502 --> 31:30.129
...would be the great and wonderful
Wizard of Oz himself.

31:30.297 --> 31:33.382
The Wizard of Oz?
Is he good or is he wicked?

31:33.550 --> 31:36.094
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.

31:36.261 --> 31:39.138
He lives in the Emerald City,
a long journey from here.

31:39.306 --> 31:41.974
Did you bring your broomstick
with you?

31:42.267 --> 31:45.811
- No, I'm afraid I didn't.
- Well, then, you'll have to walk.

31:45.978 --> 31:49.356
The Munchkins will see you safely
to the border of Munchkinland.

31:49.524 --> 31:53.985
And remember, never let those ruby
slippers off your feet for a moment...

31:54.153 --> 31:57.989
...or you will be at the mercy
of the Wicked Witch of the West.

31:58.449 --> 32:01.284
But how do I start for Emerald City?

32:01.452 --> 32:03.537
It's always best
to start at the beginning.

32:03.704 --> 32:07.958
And all you do is
follow the Yellow Brick Road.

32:17.093 --> 32:21.847
- But what happens if I...
- Just follow the Yellow Brick Road.

32:22.140 --> 32:24.558
Goodbye!

32:38.030 --> 32:39.489
My!

32:39.657 --> 32:42.450
People come and go so quickly here!

32:44.912 --> 32:47.622
Follow the Yellow Brick Road

32:49.542 --> 32:52.127
Follow the Yellow Brick Road?

32:52.920 --> 33:02.344
Follow the Yellow Brick Road

33:02.512 --> 33:04.430
Follow the Yellow Brick Road

33:04.598 --> 33:05.848
Follow the Yellow Brick Road

33:06.016 --> 33:09.727
Follow, follow, follow, follow
Follow the Yellow Brick Road

33:12.856 --> 33:14.398
Follow the Yellow Brick

33:14.733 --> 33:16.817
Follow the Yellow Brick Road

33:19.738 --> 33:23.157
You're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

33:23.325 --> 33:26.702
You'll find he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was

33:26.870 --> 33:30.164
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because

33:30.332 --> 33:33.667
Because, because, because
Because, because

33:33.835 --> 33:36.462
Because of the wonderful things he does

33:37.380 --> 33:42.176
You're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

33:59.486 --> 34:01.946
Follow the Yellow Brick Road?

34:02.239 --> 34:04.031
Follow the Yellow...?

34:05.325 --> 34:06.659
Now which way do we go?

34:06.826 --> 34:09.953
Pardon me!
That way is a very nice way.

34:12.706 --> 34:13.998
Who said that?

34:18.295 --> 34:19.712
Don't be silly, Toto.

34:19.880 --> 34:23.466
- Scarecrows don't talk.
- It's pleasant down that way too.

34:24.802 --> 34:28.513
That's funny.
Wasn't he pointing the other way?

34:28.681 --> 34:32.100
Of course, people do go both ways.

34:35.020 --> 34:39.107
Why, you did say something,
didn't you?

34:43.320 --> 34:46.364
Are you doing that on purpose,
or can't you make up your mind?

34:46.572 --> 34:49.492
That's the trouble.
I can't make up my mind.

34:49.659 --> 34:51.411
I haven't got a brain.

34:51.578 --> 34:53.621
Only straw.

34:53.831 --> 34:56.456
How can you talk if you
haven't got a brain?

34:56.625 --> 34:58.209
I don't know.

34:58.377 --> 35:02.171
But some people without brains
do a lot of talking, don't they?

35:02.339 --> 35:05.091
Yes, I guess you're right.

35:05.801 --> 35:09.220
Well, we haven't really
met properly, have we?

35:10.014 --> 35:11.347
Why, no.

35:11.557 --> 35:14.267
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

35:14.435 --> 35:17.645
- Very well, thank you.
- Oh, I'm not feeling at all well.

35:17.813 --> 35:22.816
It's very tedious being stuck up here
all day long with a pole up your back.

35:22.984 --> 35:27.112
Oh, dear. That must be terribly
uncomfortable. Can't you get down?

35:27.280 --> 35:29.823
Down? No, you see, I'm...
Well, I'm...

35:29.991 --> 35:32.075
Oh, well, here. Let me help you.

35:32.243 --> 35:35.245
Oh, that's very kind of you.
Very kind.

35:37.081 --> 35:38.498
Oh, dear. I don't see...

35:38.958 --> 35:42.252
Of course, I'm not bright
about doing things...

35:42.420 --> 35:46.882
...but if you'll just bend the nail down,
maybe I'll slip off and...

35:47.050 --> 35:48.967
Oh, yes!

35:49.218 --> 35:50.385
Whoops!

35:50.845 --> 35:53.472
- There goes some of me again!
- Does it hurt you?

35:53.639 --> 35:57.893
Oh, no. I just keep picking it up
and putting it back in again.

35:58.061 --> 36:00.187
My! It's good to be free!

36:02.398 --> 36:03.732
Did I scare you?

36:03.900 --> 36:07.194
No, no. I just thought
you hurt yourself.

36:07.362 --> 36:10.447
- But I didn't scare you?
- No, of course not.

36:10.656 --> 36:12.157
I didn't think so.

36:13.534 --> 36:14.868
Boo! Scat! Boo!

36:18.581 --> 36:21.500
You see? I can't even scare a crow.

36:21.667 --> 36:26.046
They come from miles around just to eat
in my field and laugh in my face.

36:26.214 --> 36:29.716
Oh, I'm a failure, because
I haven't got a brain!

36:30.051 --> 36:33.011
Well, what would you do
with a brain if you had one?

36:33.178 --> 36:35.262
Do? Why, if I had a brain, I could...

36:36.139 --> 36:40.142
I could while away the hours
Conferring with the flowers

36:40.310 --> 36:42.895
Consulting with the rain

36:43.772 --> 36:47.316
And my head I'd be scratchin'
While my thoughts were busy hatchin'

36:47.484 --> 36:50.152
If I only had a brain

36:51.196 --> 36:55.116
I'd unravel every riddle
For any individ'le

36:55.283 --> 36:57.743
In trouble or in pain

36:58.870 --> 37:02.415
With the thoughts you'd be thinkin'
You could be another Lincoln

37:02.582 --> 37:06.168
If you only had a brain

37:06.336 --> 37:10.214
Oh, I could tell you why

37:10.382 --> 37:13.717
The ocean's near the shore

37:13.885 --> 37:17.221
I could think of things
I never thunk before

37:17.389 --> 37:21.142
And then I'd sit
And think some more

37:21.309 --> 37:25.104
I would not be just a nothin'
My head all full of stuffin'

37:25.272 --> 37:28.232
My heart all full of pain

37:28.942 --> 37:32.319
I would dance and be merry
Life would be a ding-a-derry

37:32.487 --> 37:34.947
If I only had a brain

37:35.115 --> 37:36.782
Whoa!

37:38.452 --> 37:39.994
Wonderful!

37:40.162 --> 37:42.997
Why, if our scarecrow back in Kansas
could do that...

37:43.165 --> 37:46.166
...the crows would be scared to pieces!
- They would?

37:46.333 --> 37:48.668
- Where's Kansas?
- That's where I live.

37:48.836 --> 37:51.796
I wanna get back there so badly,
I'm going to Emerald City...

37:51.964 --> 37:54.048
...to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.

37:54.216 --> 37:56.634
- You're going to see a wizard?
- Mm-hmm.

37:57.303 --> 38:00.472
Do you think if I went,
this wizard would give me brains?

38:00.639 --> 38:02.515
I couldn't say.

38:02.683 --> 38:06.686
But even if he didn't, you'd be
no worse off than you are now.

38:06.854 --> 38:09.355
- Yes, that's true.
- But maybe you better not.

38:09.523 --> 38:12.025
I've got a witch mad at me,
and you might get into trouble.

38:12.193 --> 38:17.280
Witch? I'm not afraid of a witch!
I'm not afraid of anything!

38:18.824 --> 38:22.035
- Except a lighted match.
- I don't blame you for that.

38:22.203 --> 38:26.331
But I'd face a whole box of them
for the chance of getting some brains.

38:28.167 --> 38:30.960
Look, I won't be any trouble,
because I don't eat a thing.

38:31.128 --> 38:35.006
And I won't try to manage things,
because I can't think.

38:35.174 --> 38:36.591
Won't you take me with you?

38:37.551 --> 38:39.010
Why, of course I will!

38:39.845 --> 38:42.639
Hooray! We're off to see a wizard!

38:42.806 --> 38:45.225
You're not starting out very well.

38:45.392 --> 38:47.519
Oh, I'll try! Really, I will.

38:47.686 --> 38:48.895
- To Oz?
- To Oz!

38:49.230 --> 38:51.731
We're off to see the Wizard

38:51.899 --> 38:53.525
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

38:53.692 --> 38:57.111
We hear he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was

38:57.279 --> 39:00.739
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because

39:00.907 --> 39:04.284
Because, because, because
Because, because

39:04.452 --> 39:07.204
Because of the wonderful things he does

39:08.039 --> 39:14.336
We're off to see the wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

39:25.390 --> 39:26.598
Oh.

39:27.392 --> 39:29.560
Apples!

39:29.894 --> 39:32.521
Oh, look!

39:34.148 --> 39:35.691
Oh!

39:38.653 --> 39:39.695
Ouch!

39:40.154 --> 39:42.072
What do you think you're doing?

39:43.866 --> 39:47.619
We've been walking a long ways
and I was hungry and...

39:48.037 --> 39:49.371
Did you say something?

39:49.539 --> 39:51.540
- She was hungry!
She was hungry!

39:51.708 --> 39:55.752
How would like to have someone come
along and pick something off of you?

39:55.920 --> 40:00.257
Oh, dear! I keep forgetting
I'm not in Kansas.

40:00.425 --> 40:01.967
Come along, Dorothy.

40:02.135 --> 40:04.428
You don't want any of those apples.
Hmm.

40:04.596 --> 40:06.722
Are you hinting my apples aren't
what they ought to be?

40:06.889 --> 40:10.641
Oh, no! It's just that she doesn't
like little green worms.

40:10.809 --> 40:11.976
Oh, you!

40:16.815 --> 40:19.066
I'll show you how to get apples.

40:21.278 --> 40:22.820
Oh! Oh!

40:25.407 --> 40:29.285
Hooray! I guess that did it. Help yourself.

40:53.769 --> 40:56.354
Why, it's a man!

40:57.105 --> 40:59.940
A man made out of tin!

41:00.108 --> 41:02.109
Yes!

41:02.903 --> 41:04.487
Look!

41:08.283 --> 41:09.992
Did you say something?

41:12.371 --> 41:13.996
He said "oilcan. "

41:14.164 --> 41:17.833
- Oil can what?
- Oilcan?

41:18.794 --> 41:21.170
Oh, here it is.

41:22.089 --> 41:23.838
Where do you want to be oiled first?

41:25.841 --> 41:27.717
He said his mouth.

41:31.305 --> 41:33.014
The other side.

41:40.731 --> 41:43.191
Mm... Mm... Mm...

41:43.359 --> 41:46.319
My goodness! I can talk again! Oh!

41:46.487 --> 41:50.281
Oil my arms, please. Oil my elbows.

41:50.449 --> 41:51.866
Here.

41:55.204 --> 41:58.790
- Did that hurt?
- No, it feels wonderful.

41:58.958 --> 42:01.334
I've held that axe up for ages.

42:01.502 --> 42:06.172
Goodness!
How did you ever get like this?

42:06.340 --> 42:08.842
Well, about a year ago...

42:09.009 --> 42:10.802
...I was chopping that tree...

42:10.970 --> 42:12.846
...when suddenly it began to rain.

42:13.013 --> 42:17.016
And right in the middle of a chop,
I rusted solid.

42:17.184 --> 42:19.894
And I've been that way ever since.

42:22.523 --> 42:24.607
Well, you're perfect now.

42:24.775 --> 42:26.693
My neck. My neck.

42:26.861 --> 42:28.236
Perfect?

42:28.404 --> 42:31.239
Bang on my chest
if you think I'm perfect.

42:31.407 --> 42:33.700
Go ahead, bang on it!

42:35.660 --> 42:38.370
Beautiful! What an echo!

42:38.538 --> 42:40.456
It's empty.

42:41.082 --> 42:44.460
The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.

42:44.753 --> 42:46.670
- No heart?
- No heart?

42:46.838 --> 42:48.505
No heart.

42:48.673 --> 42:50.924
All hollow.

42:54.554 --> 42:56.972
When a man's an empty kettle

42:57.140 --> 42:59.433
He should be on his mettle

42:59.601 --> 43:03.270
And yet I'm torn apart

43:03.855 --> 43:08.317
Just because I'm presumin'
That I could be kind of human

43:08.485 --> 43:11.612
If I only had a heart

43:12.947 --> 43:17.785
I'd be tender, I'd be gentle
And awful sentimental

43:17.952 --> 43:21.205
Regarding love and art

43:22.081 --> 43:26.627
I'd be friends with the sparrows
And the boy who shoots the arrows

43:26.795 --> 43:30.923
If I only had a heart

43:31.466 --> 43:35.928
Picture me
A balcony

43:36.095 --> 43:40.557
Above, a voice sings low

43:40.725 --> 43:44.520
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?

43:44.687 --> 43:46.688
I hear a beat

43:47.899 --> 43:49.190
How sweet!

43:49.358 --> 43:54.278
Just to register emotion
Jealousy, devotion

43:54.446 --> 43:58.157
And really feel the part

43:58.575 --> 44:04.205
I could stay young and chipper
And I'd lock it with a zipper

44:04.373 --> 44:07.834
If I only had a heart

45:29.457 --> 45:31.499
Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh!

45:31.667 --> 45:34.502
- Are you all right?
- I'm a little rusty yet.

45:34.670 --> 45:36.630
Oh, dear!

45:36.797 --> 45:39.090
That was wonderful!

45:39.300 --> 45:43.386
You know, we were wondering
why you couldn't come with us...

45:43.554 --> 45:46.681
...to the Emerald City
to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.

45:47.016 --> 45:49.726
Suppose the Wizard wouldn't
give me one when we got there.

45:49.894 --> 45:51.436
Oh, but he will!

45:51.604 --> 45:52.979
He must!

45:53.147 --> 45:55.649
We've come such a long way already.

46:01.781 --> 46:05.867
You call that long?
Why, you've just begun!

46:06.035 --> 46:09.537
Helping the little lady along,
are you, my fine gentlemen?

46:09.705 --> 46:11.957
Well, stay away from her...

46:12.124 --> 46:14.208
...or I'll stuff a mattress with you!

46:15.293 --> 46:16.585
And you!

46:16.753 --> 46:19.546
I'll use you for a beehive!

46:19.714 --> 46:23.133
Here, scarecrow. Wanna play ball?

46:26.888 --> 46:30.307
Fire! I'm burning! I'm burning!

46:42.237 --> 46:43.862
I'm not afraid of her.

46:44.030 --> 46:47.700
I'll see you get safely to the Wizard,
whether I get a brain or not!

46:47.867 --> 46:49.201
Stuff a mattress with me!

46:51.246 --> 46:54.206
I'll see you reach the Wizard,
whether I get a heart or not.

46:54.374 --> 46:56.166
Beehive! Bah!

46:56.334 --> 46:59.670
Let her try and make
a beehive out of me.

47:01.047 --> 47:04.925
Oh, you're the best friends
anybody ever had.

47:05.093 --> 47:09.513
And it's funny, but I feel as if
I've known you all the time.

47:09.681 --> 47:12.850
- But I couldn't have, could I?
- I don't see how.

47:13.018 --> 47:16.353
You weren't around when I was
stuffed and sewn together, were you?

47:16.521 --> 47:20.274
And I was standing over there
rusting for the longest time.

47:20.442 --> 47:23.152
Still, I wish I could remember.

47:23.319 --> 47:27.739
But I guess it doesn't matter anyway.
We know each other now, don't we?

47:27.990 --> 47:30.074
- That's right.
- We do.

47:30.242 --> 47:31.993
- To Oz?
- To Oz!

47:32.161 --> 47:33.995
We're off to see the Wizard

47:34.163 --> 47:35.997
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

47:36.165 --> 47:39.417
We hear he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was

47:39.585 --> 47:42.879
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because

47:43.047 --> 47:46.424
Because, because, because
Because, because

47:46.592 --> 47:49.427
Because of the wonderful things he does

47:50.054 --> 47:56.934
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

48:18.290 --> 48:21.042
I don't like this forest.

48:21.585 --> 48:24.712
It's dark and creepy.

48:24.880 --> 48:30.301
Of course, I don't know, but I think
it'll get darker before it gets lighter.

48:30.636 --> 48:31.761
Do...

48:31.929 --> 48:34.680
Do you suppose we'll meet
any wild animals?

48:34.848 --> 48:36.474
We might.

48:36.642 --> 48:40.227
Animals that eat straw?

48:40.394 --> 48:43.855
Some, but mostly lions
and tigers and bears.

48:44.023 --> 48:45.482
- Lions!
- And tigers?

48:45.650 --> 48:47.317
And bears!

48:47.944 --> 48:51.363
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!

48:51.531 --> 48:55.242
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!

48:55.409 --> 49:02.541
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!

49:05.545 --> 49:06.837
Oh!

49:27.233 --> 49:30.485
Put 'em up! Put 'em up!

49:30.695 --> 49:32.362
Which one of you first?

49:32.530 --> 49:34.906
I'll fight you both together,
if you want.

49:35.074 --> 49:38.326
I'll fight you with
one paw tied behind my back!

49:38.661 --> 49:40.704
I'll fight you standing on one foot!

49:40.913 --> 49:43.373
I'll fight you with my eyes closed!

49:43.791 --> 49:46.668
Oh, pulling an ax on me, eh?

49:47.920 --> 49:51.088
Sneaking up on me, eh? Why...

49:52.591 --> 49:55.801
- Here, here. Go away and let us alone.
- Oh, scared, huh?

49:55.969 --> 49:57.386
Afraid, huh?

49:57.971 --> 49:59.763
How long can you stay fresh
in that can?

50:01.433 --> 50:06.187
Come on, get up and fight,
you shivering junkyard.

50:06.479 --> 50:09.315
Put your hands up,
you lopsided bag of hay!

50:09.482 --> 50:11.066
That's getting personal, Lion.

50:11.818 --> 50:14.153
Yes, get up and teach him a lesson.

50:14.321 --> 50:16.739
What's wrong with you teaching him?

50:16.907 --> 50:18.866
Well, I hardly know him.

50:20.827 --> 50:22.661
Well, I'll get you anyway, peewee.

50:33.215 --> 50:34.256
Shame on you!

50:35.634 --> 50:38.552
What did you do that for?
I didn't bite him.

50:38.720 --> 50:40.638
No, but you tried to.

50:40.805 --> 50:44.516
It's bad enough picking on a straw man,
but picking on poor little dogs...

50:44.684 --> 50:48.312
Well, you didn't have to go
and hit me, did you?

50:48.939 --> 50:50.648
Is my nose bleeding?

50:50.815 --> 50:53.234
Well, of course not.

50:54.694 --> 50:57.112
My goodness,
what a fuss you're making!

50:57.280 --> 51:01.617
Well, naturally, when you go around
picking on things weaker than you are...

51:01.785 --> 51:03.534
You're nothing but a big coward!

51:03.702 --> 51:06.162
You're right, I am a coward!

51:07.289 --> 51:09.707
I haven't any courage at all.

51:09.875 --> 51:12.627
I even scare myself!

51:13.462 --> 51:15.588
Look at the circles under my eyes.

51:15.756 --> 51:17.548
I haven't slept in weeks.

51:17.716 --> 51:19.676
Why don't you try counting sheep?

51:19.843 --> 51:23.513
That doesn't do any good.
I'm afraid of them.

51:24.390 --> 51:26.641
Oh, that's too bad.

51:27.101 --> 51:29.519
Don't you think the Wizard
could help him too?

51:29.687 --> 51:31.771
I don't see why not.

51:31.939 --> 51:33.314
Come along with us.

51:33.482 --> 51:36.401
We're on our way to see the Wizard.
To get him a heart.

51:36.568 --> 51:39.737
- And him a brain.
- He could give you some courage.

51:40.489 --> 51:45.326
Wouldn't you feel degraded to be seen
in the company of a cowardly lion?

51:45.494 --> 51:47.036
I would.

51:47.579 --> 51:49.497
No, of course not.

51:50.040 --> 51:53.626
Gee, that's awfully nice of you.

51:53.794 --> 51:57.463
- My life has been simply unbearable.
- Oh.

51:57.631 --> 51:59.674
Well, it's all right now.

51:59.842 --> 52:02.176
The Wizard'll fix everything.

52:02.344 --> 52:05.179
It's been in me so long.

52:05.347 --> 52:07.682
I just gotta tell you how I feel.

52:08.267 --> 52:09.684
Well, come on!

52:10.352 --> 52:12.729
Yeah, it's sad,
Believe me, missy

52:12.896 --> 52:14.564
When you're born to be a sissy

52:14.732 --> 52:17.441
Without the vim and verve

52:18.401 --> 52:22.321
But I could show my prowess
Be a lion, not a mouse

52:22.488 --> 52:25.240
If I only had the nerve

52:26.200 --> 52:30.454
I'm afraid there's no denyin'
I'm just a dandy lion

52:30.621 --> 52:33.165
A fate I don't deserve

52:34.208 --> 52:38.128
- I'd be brave as a blizzard
- I'd be gentle as a lizard

52:38.296 --> 52:40.130
I'd be clever as a gizzard

52:40.298 --> 52:45.594
If the Wizard is a wizard
Who will serve

52:45.762 --> 52:47.596
Then I'm sure to get a brain

52:47.764 --> 52:49.723
- A heart
- A home

52:49.891 --> 52:51.433
The nerve!

52:51.809 --> 52:53.393
Oh

52:53.561 --> 52:56.813
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

52:56.981 --> 53:00.567
We hear he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was

53:00.735 --> 53:03.779
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because

53:03.946 --> 53:07.282
Because, because, because
Because, because

53:07.450 --> 53:10.494
Because of the wonderful things he does

53:10.953 --> 53:15.957
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

53:23.716 --> 53:26.259
So you won't take warning, eh?

53:26.427 --> 53:28.260
All the worse for you, then.

53:28.428 --> 53:32.139
I'll take care of you now
instead of later!

53:34.976 --> 53:37.228
When I gain those ruby slippers...

53:37.396 --> 53:40.773
...my power will be the greatest in Oz!

53:41.650 --> 53:43.943
And now, my beauties...

53:44.111 --> 53:47.321
...something with poison in it, I think.

53:47.489 --> 53:49.657
With poison in it.

53:49.825 --> 53:55.413
But attractive to the eye
and soothing to the smell!

53:56.832 --> 53:58.624
Poppies.

53:58.875 --> 54:01.085
Poppies!

54:01.253 --> 54:04.672
Poppies will put them to sleep.

54:04.840 --> 54:06.966
Sleep...

54:07.134 --> 54:10.928
Now they'll sleep.

54:39.791 --> 54:41.374
There's Emerald City!

54:41.542 --> 54:45.211
Oh, we're almost there!
At last! At last!

54:45.379 --> 54:49.424
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Just like I knew it would be.

54:49.592 --> 54:52.802
He really must be a wonderful wizard
to live in a city like that.

54:53.053 --> 54:54.971
Come on, what are we waiting for?

54:55.139 --> 54:58.266
Nothing! Let's hurry!
Yes, let's run!

55:02.855 --> 55:05.148
- Come on! Come on!
- Hurry! Hurry!

55:09.236 --> 55:10.945
Oh, look!

55:11.113 --> 55:13.281
Come on! Come on!

55:13.449 --> 55:15.658
Look at the scenery. It's wonderful!

55:15.826 --> 55:17.368
Emerald City!

55:21.665 --> 55:24.584
Oh. What's happening?

55:24.752 --> 55:26.503
What is it?

55:26.712 --> 55:28.838
I can't run anymore.

55:29.006 --> 55:32.258
- I'm so sleepy.
- Give us your hands and we'll pull you.

55:32.426 --> 55:35.887
Oh, no, please.
I have to rest for just a minute.

55:36.055 --> 55:38.598
Toto. Where's Toto?

55:38.807 --> 55:41.226
You can't rest now.
We're nearly there.

55:43.729 --> 55:45.897
Don't cry.
You'll rust yourself again!

55:46.065 --> 55:49.984
Coming to think of it,
forty winks wouldn't be bad.

55:50.152 --> 55:52.820
- Don't you start it too!
- No!

55:52.988 --> 55:54.571
We ought to carry Dorothy.

55:54.739 --> 55:56.782
I don't think I could,
but we could try.

55:56.950 --> 55:58.909
- Let's.
- Yes.

55:59.452 --> 56:03.872
- Now look at him. This is terrible!
- Here, Tin Man, help me.

56:05.875 --> 56:08.669
Oh, this is terrible!
I can't budge her an inch.

56:08.836 --> 56:10.462
This is a spell, this is!

56:10.630 --> 56:13.590
It's the Wicked Witch! What'll we do?

56:13.758 --> 56:16.218
Help! Help!

56:16.386 --> 56:18.554
It's no use screaming
at a time like this.

56:18.721 --> 56:21.682
Nobody will hear you!
Help! Help!

56:21.891 --> 56:23.892
Help!

56:27.730 --> 56:29.189
It's snowing!

56:30.733 --> 56:33.026
No, it isn't.

56:33.444 --> 56:35.779
Yes, it is!

56:36.155 --> 56:37.781
Maybe that'll help!

56:38.741 --> 56:40.909
Oh, but it couldn't help!

56:41.578 --> 56:45.914
It does help!
Dorothy, you're waking up!

56:46.457 --> 56:48.667
Oh. Oh.

56:52.171 --> 56:55.007
Unusual weather we're having,
ain't it?

56:55.633 --> 56:58.802
Look! He's rusted again.

56:59.387 --> 57:02.556
- Oh, give me the oilcan, quick!
Here.

57:03.391 --> 57:04.725
- He is rusted.
Here.

57:04.892 --> 57:08.603
Here.
Quick! Oh! Oh!

57:08.770 --> 57:10.313
Curses! Curses!

57:10.480 --> 57:12.773
Somebody always helps that girl.

57:14.818 --> 57:18.696
But shoes or no shoes,
I'm still great enough to conquer her.

57:18.864 --> 57:20.448
And woe to those who try to stop me!

57:20.741 --> 57:23.075
Come on, let's get out of here.

57:23.243 --> 57:25.578
Look! Emerald City is closer
and prettier than ever!

57:25.746 --> 57:27.538
You're out of the woods

57:27.706 --> 57:30.124
You're out of the dark
You're out of the night

57:30.292 --> 57:34.170
Step into the sun
Step into the light

57:34.338 --> 57:37.465
Keep straight ahead for
The most glorious place

57:37.633 --> 57:42.219
On the face of the earth
Or the sky

57:42.387 --> 57:44.180
Hold on to your breath
Hold on to your heart

57:44.348 --> 57:46.390
Hold on to your hope

57:46.558 --> 57:50.019
March up to the gate
And bid it open

57:55.359 --> 57:58.819
To the Emerald City,
as fast as lightning!

58:08.914 --> 58:10.706
You're out of the woods

58:10.874 --> 58:13.167
You're out of the dark
You're out of the night

58:13.335 --> 58:15.252
Step into the sun
Step into the light

58:15.420 --> 58:18.130
March up to the gate
And bid it...

58:18.297 --> 58:20.215
...open

58:20.424 --> 58:22.342
Open

58:27.598 --> 58:29.641
Who rang that bell?

58:29.809 --> 58:31.726
We did!
- Can't you read?

58:31.894 --> 58:34.145
- Read what?
- The notice!

58:34.313 --> 58:36.189
What notice?
- It's on the door!

58:36.399 --> 58:39.818
As plain as the nose on my face!

58:40.027 --> 58:41.361
Oh... Uh...

58:41.696 --> 58:44.030
Oh! Tsk, tsk, tsk.

58:48.369 --> 58:52.372
"Bell out of order. Please knock. "

58:53.958 --> 58:56.334
Well! That's more like it!

58:56.502 --> 58:58.336
Now, state your business.

58:58.504 --> 59:01.131
We wanna see the Wizard.

59:02.216 --> 59:03.967
The Wizard?

59:04.135 --> 59:06.720
But nobody can see the great Oz.

59:06.887 --> 59:11.099
Nobody's ever seen the great Oz!
Even I've never seen him!

59:11.267 --> 59:13.768
Well, then, how do you know
there is one?

59:14.061 --> 59:15.937
Because he's...

59:16.105 --> 59:19.691
Oh! You're wasting my time!

59:19.859 --> 59:23.862
Oh, please. Please, sir.
I've got to see the Wizard.

59:24.029 --> 59:27.407
- The Good Witch of the North sent me.
- Prove it!

59:27.616 --> 59:30.826
She's wearing the ruby slippers
that she gave her.

59:33.997 --> 59:39.001
Oh! So she is!
Well, bust my buttons!

59:39.169 --> 59:41.628
Why didn't you say that
in the first place?

59:41.796 --> 59:44.047
That's a horse of a different color!

59:44.215 --> 59:46.717
Come on in!

59:57.812 --> 59:59.313
Cabby! Cabby!

59:59.481 --> 01:00:03.400
Just what you're looking for.
Take you any place in the city, we does.

01:00:03.735 --> 01:00:08.655
- Would you take us to see the Wizard?
- The Wizard? The Wizard?

01:00:09.991 --> 01:00:13.076
Yes, of course. But first I'll
take you to a little place...

01:00:13.244 --> 01:00:17.080
...where you can tidy up a bit.
- Oh, thank you so much!

01:00:17.248 --> 01:00:22.002
We've been gone such a long time,
and we feel so mess...

01:00:22.337 --> 01:00:26.590
What kind of a horse is that?
I've never seen a horse like that before!

01:00:26.758 --> 01:00:30.719
No, and never will again, I fancy.
There's only one of him, and he's it.

01:00:30.887 --> 01:00:34.681
He's the horse of a different color
you've heard tell about.

01:00:35.016 --> 01:00:36.725
Ha-ha-ha! Ho-ho-ho!

01:00:36.893 --> 01:00:38.769
And a couple of tra-la-las

01:00:38.937 --> 01:00:43.232
That's how we laugh the day away
In the merry old land of Oz

01:00:43.398 --> 01:00:45.066
Bzz, bzz, bzz!
Chirp, chirp, chirp!

01:00:45.234 --> 01:00:47.109
And a couple of la-di-das

01:00:47.277 --> 01:00:51.072
That's how the crickets crick all day
In the merry old land of Oz

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:55.284
We get up at twelve
And start to work at one

01:00:55.452 --> 01:00:58.579
Take an hour for lunch
And then at two we're done

01:00:58.747 --> 01:00:59.789
Jolly good fun!

01:00:59.957 --> 01:01:01.582
Ha-ha-ha!
Ho-ho-ho!

01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:03.709
And a couple of tra-la-las

01:01:03.877 --> 01:01:07.922
That's how we laugh the day away
In the merry old land of Oz

01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:10.091
Ha-ha-ha!
Ho-ho-ho!

01:01:10.259 --> 01:01:11.884
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

01:01:12.052 --> 01:01:14.262
That's how we laugh the day away
With a

01:01:14.429 --> 01:01:16.138
Ho-ho-ho!
Ha-ha-ha!

01:01:16.306 --> 01:01:18.474
In the merry old land of Oz

01:01:18.642 --> 01:01:20.393
Pat, pat here
Pat, pat there

01:01:20.561 --> 01:01:22.436
And a couple of brand-new straws

01:01:22.604 --> 01:01:26.983
That's how we keep you young and fair
In the merry old land of Oz

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:29.110
Rub, rub here
Rub, rub there

01:01:29.278 --> 01:01:30.945
Whether you're tin or bronze

01:01:31.113 --> 01:01:34.866
That's how we keep you in repair
In the merry old land of Oz

01:01:35.033 --> 01:01:39.078
We can make a dimpled smile
Out of a frown

01:01:39.246 --> 01:01:41.831
Can you even dye my eyes
To match my gown?

01:01:41.999 --> 01:01:43.749
- Uh-huh
Jolly old town!

01:01:43.917 --> 01:01:45.751
Clip, clip here
Clip, clip there

01:01:45.919 --> 01:01:47.753
We give the roughest claws

01:01:47.921 --> 01:01:52.508
That certain air of savoir-faire
In the merry old land of Oz

01:01:56.137 --> 01:01:59.973
That's how we laugh the day away
In the merry old land of Oz

01:02:00.141 --> 01:02:03.310
That's how we laugh the day away
With a ha-ha-ha

01:02:08.107 --> 01:02:10.609
In the merry old land of Oz

01:02:28.544 --> 01:02:30.128
Who's her? Who's her?

01:02:30.296 --> 01:02:33.089
It's the witch!
She's followed us here!

01:02:33.257 --> 01:02:35.508
"Surrender, Dorothy. "

01:02:37.011 --> 01:02:38.678
Dorothy? Who's Dorothy?

01:02:38.846 --> 01:02:41.598
- The Wizard will explain it!
- To the Wizard!

01:02:41.807 --> 01:02:44.017
Dear! Whatever shall we do?

01:02:44.185 --> 01:02:46.978
We better hurry if we're
gonna see the Wizard!

01:02:48.773 --> 01:02:52.233
Here! Here, here!
Everything is all right.

01:02:52.401 --> 01:02:54.235
Stop that now, just...

01:02:54.403 --> 01:02:56.905
It's all right!
Everything is all right!

01:02:57.073 --> 01:03:01.534
The great and powerful Oz
has got matters well in hand.

01:03:01.702 --> 01:03:03.036
I hope.

01:03:03.204 --> 01:03:06.539
So you can all go home!
There's nothing to worry about!

01:03:06.707 --> 01:03:10.125
Get out of here. Now go on!
Go on home.

01:03:10.502 --> 01:03:12.169
Go home.

01:03:12.879 --> 01:03:16.090
We want to see the Wizard right away.
All four of us.

01:03:16.257 --> 01:03:20.970
Orders are, nobody can see
the great Oz! Not nobody, not nohow!

01:03:21.137 --> 01:03:23.722
But, please! It's very important.

01:03:23.890 --> 01:03:26.100
I got a permanent
just for the occasion.

01:03:26.267 --> 01:03:28.852
Not nobody, not nohow!

01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:30.437
But she's Dorothy!

01:03:31.022 --> 01:03:33.691
The witch's Dorothy?

01:03:34.859 --> 01:03:36.652
Well, that makes a difference.

01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:41.907
Just wait here.
I'll announce you at once.

01:03:45.662 --> 01:03:48.122
Did you hear that?
He'll announce us at once.

01:03:48.289 --> 01:03:51.500
- I've as good as got my brain.
- I can fairly hear my heart beating.

01:03:51.668 --> 01:03:53.002
I'll be home for supper.

01:03:53.169 --> 01:03:55.796
In another hour,
I'll be king of the forest.

01:03:55.964 --> 01:03:59.174
Long live the king!

01:04:06.391 --> 01:04:11.520
If I were king of the forest

01:04:11.688 --> 01:04:13.188
Not queen

01:04:13.356 --> 01:04:14.815
Not duke

01:04:14.983 --> 01:04:17.234
Not prince

01:04:17.652 --> 01:04:21.988
My regal robes of the forest

01:04:22.197 --> 01:04:23.573
Would be satin

01:04:23.741 --> 01:04:25.283
Not cotton

01:04:25.451 --> 01:04:28.453
Not chintz

01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:32.248
I'd command each thing
Be it fish or fowl

01:04:32.416 --> 01:04:33.708
With a woof!

01:04:33.876 --> 01:04:35.209
And a woof!

01:04:35.377 --> 01:04:38.463
And a royal growl

01:04:40.382 --> 01:04:42.925
As I'd click my heel
All the trees would kneel

01:04:43.093 --> 01:04:47.805
And the mountains bow
And the bulls kowtow

01:04:48.891 --> 01:04:55.313
And the sparrow would take wing

01:04:55.481 --> 01:04:57.148
If I

01:04:57.316 --> 01:05:03.321
If I were king

01:05:03.947 --> 01:05:07.700
Each rabbit would show respect to me

01:05:07.868 --> 01:05:11.412
The chipmunks genuflect to me

01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:13.331
Though my tail would lash

01:05:13.499 --> 01:05:15.249
I would show compash

01:05:15.417 --> 01:05:19.462
For every underling

01:05:19.630 --> 01:05:21.547
If I

01:05:21.715 --> 01:05:26.010
If I were king

01:05:26.845 --> 01:05:32.391
Just king

01:06:02.797 --> 01:06:08.260
Monarch of all I survey

01:06:08.469 --> 01:06:13.682
Monarch

01:06:13.850 --> 01:06:19.146
Of all I survey

01:06:20.982 --> 01:06:24.067
If you were king,
you wouldn't be afraid of anything?

01:06:24.235 --> 01:06:27.320
Not nobody, not nohow!

01:06:27.488 --> 01:06:29.948
- Not even a rhinoceros?
- Imposserous!

01:06:30.116 --> 01:06:33.952
- How about a hippopotamus?
- I'd trash him from top to "bottom-us. "

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:37.414
- Supposing you met an elephant?
- I'd wrap him up in "cello-phant"!

01:06:37.582 --> 01:06:41.209
- What if it were a brontosaurus?
- I'd show him who's king of the forest!

01:06:41.377 --> 01:06:43.670
How?
- How?

01:06:44.422 --> 01:06:45.547
Courage!

01:06:45.715 --> 01:06:48.716
What makes a king out of a slave?
Courage!

01:06:48.884 --> 01:06:53.220
What makes the flag on the mast
to wave? Courage!

01:06:53.388 --> 01:06:55.431
What makes the elephant
charge his tusk...

01:06:55.599 --> 01:06:59.018
...in the misty mist
or the dusky dusk?

01:06:59.186 --> 01:07:03.981
What makes the muskrat
guard his musk? Courage!

01:07:04.149 --> 01:07:07.151
What makes the sphinx
the Seventh Wonder? Courage!

01:07:07.319 --> 01:07:11.906
What makes the dawn come up
like thunder? Courage!

01:07:12.073 --> 01:07:13.991
What makes the Hottentot so hot?

01:07:14.159 --> 01:07:16.368
What puts the "ape" in apricot?

01:07:16.536 --> 01:07:19.079
What have they got that I ain't got?

01:07:19.247 --> 01:07:22.208
Courage!
- You can say that again.

01:07:23.251 --> 01:07:24.335
Huh?

01:07:26.046 --> 01:07:29.298
The Wizard says go away!

01:07:34.346 --> 01:07:36.722
Go away?

01:07:36.890 --> 01:07:40.309
Looks like we came a long way
for nothing.

01:07:41.937 --> 01:07:44.647
And I was so happy.

01:07:44.814 --> 01:07:46.899
I thought I was on my way home.

01:07:47.067 --> 01:07:49.735
Don't cry.
We're gonna get you to the Wizard.

01:07:49.903 --> 01:07:52.279
We certainly are.

01:07:52.906 --> 01:07:54.782
Auntie Em was so good to me...

01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:57.201
...and I never appreciated it.

01:07:57.369 --> 01:08:00.662
Running away and hurting her feelings.

01:08:01.038 --> 01:08:03.998
Professor Marvel said she was sick.

01:08:04.416 --> 01:08:06.125
She may be dying...

01:08:06.293 --> 01:08:08.253
...and it's all my fault.

01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:14.050
I'll never forgive myself.

01:08:14.218 --> 01:08:17.011
Never, never, never.

01:08:20.349 --> 01:08:23.350
Please don't cry anymore.

01:08:23.519 --> 01:08:26.729
I'll get you into the Wizard somehow.

01:08:26.897 --> 01:08:30.984
Come on.
I had an Aunt Em myself once.

01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:52.839
Wait a minute, fellas.

01:08:53.006 --> 01:08:56.801
I was just thinking, I really don't want
to see the Wizard this much.

01:08:56.969 --> 01:08:58.970
I better wait for you outside.

01:08:59.138 --> 01:09:01.973
- What's the matter?
- He's just scared again.

01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:04.642
Don't you know the Wizard
will give you courage?

01:09:04.810 --> 01:09:08.104
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.

01:09:08.272 --> 01:09:10.481
Well, then, we'll ask him for you.

01:09:10.649 --> 01:09:12.816
I'd sooner wait outside.

01:09:12.984 --> 01:09:14.776
Why? Why?

01:09:14.944 --> 01:09:18.447
Because I'm still scared!

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:25.537
- What happened?
- Somebody pulled my tail.

01:09:25.705 --> 01:09:27.747
You did it yourself.

01:09:28.082 --> 01:09:29.541
- Oh.
- Here.

01:09:29.876 --> 01:09:31.501
Come on.

01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:37.341
Come forward!

01:09:37.508 --> 01:09:39.593
Tell me when it's over!

01:09:50.438 --> 01:09:52.189
Look at that. Look at that!

01:09:56.444 --> 01:09:59.071
I wanna go home!

01:09:59.530 --> 01:10:02.657
I am Oz...

01:10:02.825 --> 01:10:05.702
...the great and powerful!

01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:11.083
Who are you?

01:10:16.547 --> 01:10:17.881
If you please...

01:10:18.049 --> 01:10:20.592
...I am Dorothy...

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:23.511
...the small and meek.

01:10:24.388 --> 01:10:26.055
We've come to ask you...

01:10:26.264 --> 01:10:28.015
- Silence!
- Oh!

01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:30.810
Oh! Jiminy crickets!

01:10:30.977 --> 01:10:33.771
The great and powerful Oz...

01:10:33.939 --> 01:10:36.941
...knows why you have come.

01:10:37.109 --> 01:10:39.193
Step forward...

01:10:39.361 --> 01:10:41.278
...Tin Man!

01:10:46.493 --> 01:10:50.663
You dare to come to me
for a heart, do you?

01:10:50.831 --> 01:10:53.666
You clinking, clanking, clattering...

01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:57.503
...collection of caliginous junk!

01:11:00.215 --> 01:11:02.049
Yes, sir.

01:11:02.217 --> 01:11:03.634
Yes, Your Honor.

01:11:03.802 --> 01:11:05.261
You see...

01:11:05.429 --> 01:11:08.931
...a while back, we were walking down
the Yellow Brick Road and...

01:11:09.099 --> 01:11:10.516
Quiet!

01:11:12.936 --> 01:11:15.146
And you, Scarecrow...

01:11:15.313 --> 01:11:18.649
...have the effrontery
to ask for a brain...

01:11:18.817 --> 01:11:23.571
...you billowing bale of bovine fodder!

01:11:24.739 --> 01:11:26.907
Yes, Your Honor.
I mean, Your Excellency.

01:11:27.075 --> 01:11:29.326
I mean, Your Wizardry!

01:11:29.494 --> 01:11:31.203
Enough!

01:11:31.997 --> 01:11:34.123
And you, Lion!

01:11:40.087 --> 01:11:42.172
Well?

01:11:48.012 --> 01:11:50.472
You ought to be ashamed
of yourself...

01:11:50.639 --> 01:11:53.725
...frightening him like that
when he came to you for help!

01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:56.519
Silence, whippersnapper!

01:11:56.687 --> 01:12:02.066
The beneficent Oz has every intention
of granting your requests.

01:12:02.234 --> 01:12:05.653
What's that? What'd he say?
Huh? What'd he say?

01:12:05.863 --> 01:12:09.282
But first, you must prove
yourselves worthy...

01:12:09.450 --> 01:12:13.244
...by performing a very small task.

01:12:14.205 --> 01:12:17.916
Bring me the broomstick
of the Witch of the West.

01:12:18.083 --> 01:12:21.211
But if we do that,
we'll have to kill her to get it.

01:12:21.378 --> 01:12:23.838
Bring me her broomstick...

01:12:24.006 --> 01:12:27.008
...and I'll grant your requests.

01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:29.802
Now go!

01:12:29.970 --> 01:12:32.263
But what if she kills us first?

01:12:32.431 --> 01:12:33.723
I said go!

01:13:19.602 --> 01:13:23.897
"I'd turn back if I were you. "

01:13:54.012 --> 01:13:56.597
I believe there's spooks around here.

01:13:56.764 --> 01:14:00.100
That's ridiculous!
Spooks. That's silly.

01:14:00.268 --> 01:14:02.560
Don't you believe in spooks?

01:14:02.728 --> 01:14:04.979
No. Why, only... Oh!

01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:15.740
Are you all right?

01:14:15.907 --> 01:14:17.491
I do believe in spooks.

01:14:17.659 --> 01:14:19.785
I do, I do, I do, I do.

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:24.624
I do believe in spooks.
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do!

01:14:26.168 --> 01:14:29.587
You'll believe in more than that
before I'm finished with you.

01:14:31.757 --> 01:14:34.675
Take your army and bring me
that girl and her dog.

01:14:34.843 --> 01:14:38.137
Do what you like with the others,
but I want her alive and unharmed.

01:14:38.305 --> 01:14:40.806
They'll give you no trouble.
I promise you that.

01:14:40.974 --> 01:14:45.061
I've sent a little insect on ahead
to take the fight out of them.

01:14:45.771 --> 01:14:49.649
Take special care of those slippers.
I want those most of all.

01:14:49.816 --> 01:14:51.525
Now, fly! Fly!

01:14:51.693 --> 01:14:54.236
Bring me that girl and her slippers!

01:14:54.404 --> 01:14:57.281
Fly! Fly! Fly!

01:15:25.935 --> 01:15:28.061
Help! Help!

01:15:28.479 --> 01:15:30.146
Go away now!

01:15:32.483 --> 01:15:35.527
Toto! Toto! Help!

01:15:50.501 --> 01:15:53.461
Help! Help! Help!

01:15:53.629 --> 01:15:54.963
What happened to you?

01:15:55.131 --> 01:15:57.465
They tore my legs off
and threw them over there!

01:15:57.633 --> 01:16:00.218
Then they took my chest
and threw it over there!

01:16:00.386 --> 01:16:01.720
That's you all over.

01:16:01.887 --> 01:16:03.888
They sure knocked
the stuffings out of you.

01:16:04.056 --> 01:16:07.600
Don't stand there. Put me together.
We've got to find Dorothy!

01:16:07.768 --> 01:16:09.269
Now, let's see...

01:16:12.273 --> 01:16:15.316
What a nice little dog.

01:16:18.821 --> 01:16:22.490
And you, my dear.
What an unexpected pleasure.

01:16:22.658 --> 01:16:27.035
It's so kind of you to visit me
in my loneliness.

01:16:28.455 --> 01:16:31.248
What are you gonna do with my dog?
Give him back to me!

01:16:31.416 --> 01:16:33.876
All in good time, my little pretty.

01:16:34.043 --> 01:16:38.005
- All in good time.
- Please give me back my dog.

01:16:38.173 --> 01:16:40.507
Certainly, certainly...

01:16:40.675 --> 01:16:43.635
...when you give me those slippers.

01:16:43.803 --> 01:16:47.639
- But the Good Witch told me not to.
- Very well.

01:16:47.807 --> 01:16:49.975
Throw that basket in the river
and drown him.

01:16:50.143 --> 01:16:54.271
No! Here. You can have your old
slippers, but give me back Toto!

01:16:54.439 --> 01:16:56.106
That's a good little girl.

01:16:56.274 --> 01:16:58.901
I knew you'd see reason!

01:17:02.197 --> 01:17:05.616
I'm sorry! I didn't do it.
Can I still have my dog?

01:17:05.784 --> 01:17:10.120
No! Fool that I am,
I should have remembered...

01:17:10.288 --> 01:17:12.539
...those slippers will
never come off...

01:17:12.707 --> 01:17:16.627
...as long as you're alive.

01:17:16.795 --> 01:17:20.631
But that's not what's worrying me.
It's how to do it.

01:17:20.799 --> 01:17:23.342
These things
must be done delicately...

01:17:23.927 --> 01:17:25.719
...or you hurt the spell.

01:17:26.387 --> 01:17:29.598
Run, Toto, run!
Catch him, you fool!

01:17:39.274 --> 01:17:41.275
Run, Toto, run!

01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:44.111
Run, Toto, run!

01:17:44.988 --> 01:17:47.657
He got away! He got away!

01:17:48.325 --> 01:17:50.368
Which is more than you will!

01:17:50.536 --> 01:17:52.078
Drat, you and your dog!

01:17:52.246 --> 01:17:54.914
You've been more trouble to me
than you're worth.

01:17:55.082 --> 01:17:58.167
But it'll soon be over now!

01:17:59.628 --> 01:18:00.962
Do you see that?

01:18:01.129 --> 01:18:03.673
That's how much longer
you've got to be alive.

01:18:03.841 --> 01:18:07.051
And it isn't long, my pretty.
It isn't long!

01:18:07.219 --> 01:18:10.012
I can't wait forever
to get those shoes!

01:18:31.785 --> 01:18:33.870
I'm frightened.

01:18:34.037 --> 01:18:37.832
I'm frightened, Auntie Em!
I'm frightened.

01:18:40.127 --> 01:18:43.129
Dorothy! Dorothy!

01:18:43.297 --> 01:18:46.883
Where are you?
It's me. It's Auntie Em.

01:18:47.050 --> 01:18:50.219
We're trying to find you.
Where are you?

01:18:50.387 --> 01:18:52.429
I'm here in Oz, Auntie Em.

01:18:52.597 --> 01:18:54.931
I'm locked up in the Witch's castle...

01:18:55.099 --> 01:18:58.101
...and I'm trying to get home to you,
Auntie Em!

01:18:58.644 --> 01:19:00.854
Oh, Auntie Em, don't go away!

01:19:01.022 --> 01:19:04.399
I'm frightened!
Come back! Come back!

01:19:04.650 --> 01:19:07.652
"Auntie Em, Auntie Em! Come back!"

01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:10.363
I'll give you Auntie Em, my pretty!

01:19:36.891 --> 01:19:41.269
Look! There's Toto.
Where'd he come from?

01:19:42.396 --> 01:19:46.900
Why, don't you see?
He's come to take us to Dorothy.

01:19:47.568 --> 01:19:49.486
Come on, fellas!

01:20:07.879 --> 01:20:09.922
I hope my strength holds out.

01:20:10.090 --> 01:20:12.800
I hope your tail holds out.

01:20:25.063 --> 01:20:26.397
What's that? What's that?

01:20:27.232 --> 01:20:29.358
That's the castle of the Wicked Witch.

01:20:29.526 --> 01:20:33.195
- Dorothy's in that awful place?
- I hate to think of her in there.

01:20:33.363 --> 01:20:36.115
- We've got to get her out.
- Don't cry now.

01:20:36.282 --> 01:20:39.702
We haven't got the oilcan, and you've
been squeaking enough as it is.

01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:41.829
Who's them? Who's them?

01:20:56.136 --> 01:20:59.888
- I've got a plan how to get in there.
- Fine. He's got a plan.

01:21:00.056 --> 01:21:02.891
- And you're gonna lead us.
- Yeah.

01:21:03.059 --> 01:21:05.477
- Me?
- Yes, you.

01:21:05.937 --> 01:21:09.356
- I gotta get her out of there?
- That's right.

01:21:10.150 --> 01:21:12.776
All right, I'll go in there
for Dorothy.

01:21:12.944 --> 01:21:14.945
Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch...

01:21:15.113 --> 01:21:18.740
...guards or no guards,
I'll tear them apart.

01:21:19.366 --> 01:21:22.994
I may not come out alive,
but I'm going in there.

01:21:23.162 --> 01:21:27.040
- There's only one thing I want you to do.
- What's that?

01:21:27.207 --> 01:21:29.500
Talk me out of it.

01:21:31.253 --> 01:21:32.587
- No, you don't!
- Oh, no.

01:21:32.755 --> 01:21:34.547
- Now, wait a minute.
Up!

01:21:51.607 --> 01:21:53.149
Shh!

01:22:06.288 --> 01:22:07.747
Shh! Shh!

01:22:34.315 --> 01:22:36.650
Come on, I've got another idea.

01:22:36.818 --> 01:22:40.403
Do you think it would be polite,
dropping in like this?

01:23:14.147 --> 01:23:16.606
- Where do we go now?
- Yeah.

01:23:19.026 --> 01:23:20.235
There!

01:23:29.871 --> 01:23:32.956
Wait! We better make sure.
Dorothy, are you in there?

01:23:33.124 --> 01:23:35.041
It's us!
- Yes!

01:23:35.209 --> 01:23:38.170
It's me! She's locked me in!

01:23:38.337 --> 01:23:40.755
We gotta get her out! Open the door!

01:23:40.923 --> 01:23:42.965
Oh, hurry! Please hurry!

01:23:43.133 --> 01:23:44.925
The hourglass is almost empty!

01:23:45.093 --> 01:23:46.719
Stand back!

01:24:02.569 --> 01:24:05.196
Oh, Toto! Toto! Oh, Lion!

01:24:05.363 --> 01:24:07.406
I knew you'd come!
I knew you would!

01:24:07.574 --> 01:24:10.409
Hurry, we've got no time to lose!

01:24:21.796 --> 01:24:25.549
Going so soon?
I wouldn't hear of it.

01:24:25.717 --> 01:24:29.762
Why, my little party's just beginning.

01:24:29.930 --> 01:24:32.640
Trapped. Trapped like mice... rats.

01:24:41.316 --> 01:24:43.859
That's right.
Don't hurt them right away.

01:24:44.027 --> 01:24:46.654
We'll let them think about it
a little first.

01:24:56.622 --> 01:24:58.873
Seize them! Seize them!

01:24:59.041 --> 01:25:00.875
Stop them, you fools!

01:25:01.043 --> 01:25:04.420
Seize them! Seize them!

01:25:13.347 --> 01:25:15.056
There they go! Now we've got them!

01:25:15.224 --> 01:25:17.600
Half of you go this way,
half of you go that way.

01:25:17.810 --> 01:25:18.935
Hurry! Hurry!

01:25:26.735 --> 01:25:28.736
Where do we go now?

01:25:28.904 --> 01:25:31.698
This way. Come on!

01:25:38.414 --> 01:25:39.622
Back! Back!

01:25:58.100 --> 01:25:59.809
Well!

01:25:59.977 --> 01:26:02.770
Ring-around the rosie,
a pocket full of spears!

01:26:02.938 --> 01:26:05.648
Thought you'd be pretty foxy,
didn't you?

01:26:05.816 --> 01:26:09.943
The last to go will see
the first three go before her.

01:26:11.487 --> 01:26:13.155
And her mangy little dog too!

01:26:21.456 --> 01:26:23.832
How about a little fire, Scarecrow?

01:26:26.002 --> 01:26:29.421
Help! I'm burning! I'm burning!
It's burning! Help!

01:26:29.589 --> 01:26:31.048
Don't throw that water!

01:26:33.509 --> 01:26:35.802
You cursed brat!
Look what you've done!

01:26:35.970 --> 01:26:38.472
I'm melting! Melting!

01:26:38.639 --> 01:26:41.016
Oh, what a world! What a world!

01:26:41.225 --> 01:26:43.643
Who would've thought
a good little girl like you...

01:26:43.811 --> 01:26:46.897
...could destroy
my beautiful wickedness?

01:26:47.065 --> 01:26:49.691
Look out! Look out!

01:26:49.859 --> 01:26:51.902
I'm going.

01:27:07.210 --> 01:27:09.961
She's dead. You've killed her.

01:27:10.129 --> 01:27:13.382
I didn't mean to kill her.
Really, I didn't.

01:27:13.549 --> 01:27:16.301
It's just that he was on fire.

01:27:16.469 --> 01:27:18.844
Hail to Dorothy!
The Wicked Witch is dead!

01:27:19.012 --> 01:27:22.848
Hail! Hail to Dorothy!
The Wicked Witch is dead!

01:27:23.016 --> 01:27:24.308
The broom.

01:27:24.518 --> 01:27:26.977
- May we have it?
- Please. And take it with you.

01:27:27.145 --> 01:27:29.605
Oh, thank you so much!

01:27:29.773 --> 01:27:32.608
Now we can go tell the Wizard
the Wicked Witch is dead!

01:27:32.776 --> 01:27:34.235
The Wicked Witch is dead!

01:27:34.403 --> 01:27:36.987
Can I believe my eyes?

01:27:37.155 --> 01:27:40.241
Why have you come back?

01:27:41.326 --> 01:27:44.245
Please, sir. We've done
what you told us.

01:27:44.413 --> 01:27:47.665
We've brought you the broomstick
of the Wicked Witch of the West.

01:27:47.833 --> 01:27:49.875
We melted her.

01:27:50.043 --> 01:27:53.796
Ah, you liquidated her, eh?

01:27:53.964 --> 01:27:55.965
- Very resourceful.
- Yes, sir.

01:27:56.133 --> 01:27:59.552
So we'd like you to keep your promise
to us, if you please, sir.

01:27:59.719 --> 01:28:03.055
Not so fast. Not so fast!

01:28:03.223 --> 01:28:05.808
I'll have to give the matter
a little thought.

01:28:05.976 --> 01:28:09.019
Go away and come back tomorrow.

01:28:09.187 --> 01:28:13.399
Tomorrow?
Oh, but I wanna go home now!

01:28:13.567 --> 01:28:16.527
- You've had plenty of time already.
- Yeah.

01:28:16.695 --> 01:28:20.573
Do not arouse the wrath
of the great and powerful Oz!

01:28:20.782 --> 01:28:23.868
I said come back tomorrow!

01:28:24.202 --> 01:28:27.121
If you were really great and powerful,
you'd keep your promises.

01:28:27.289 --> 01:28:30.958
Do you presume to criticize
the great Oz?

01:28:31.125 --> 01:28:33.626
You ungrateful creatures!

01:28:33.794 --> 01:28:37.547
Think yourselves lucky that I'm
giving you audience tomorrow...

01:28:37.715 --> 01:28:40.550
...instead of 20 years from now!

01:28:40.718 --> 01:28:42.010
Oh!

01:28:42.178 --> 01:28:46.598
The great Oz has spoken! Oh!

01:28:46.765 --> 01:28:50.560
Pay no attention to that man
behind the curtain.

01:28:50.728 --> 01:28:54.105
The great and...
Oz has spoken.

01:28:54.273 --> 01:28:56.232
Who are you?

01:28:56.400 --> 01:29:00.403
I am the great and powerful
Wizard of Oz.

01:29:00.571 --> 01:29:03.823
You are? I don't believe you.

01:29:03.991 --> 01:29:07.452
I'm afraid it's true.
There's no other Wizard except me.

01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:09.954
- You humbug!
- Yeah.

01:29:10.372 --> 01:29:13.625
Yes, that's exactly so. I'm a humbug.

01:29:14.543 --> 01:29:16.753
You're a very bad man!

01:29:16.962 --> 01:29:19.923
Oh, no, my dear. I'm a very good man.

01:29:20.090 --> 01:29:23.635
I'm just a very bad wizard.

01:29:23.969 --> 01:29:25.845
What about the heart
you promised Tin Man?

01:29:26.013 --> 01:29:28.014
And the courage you promised
Cowardly Lion?

01:29:28.182 --> 01:29:30.099
- And Scarecrow's brain?
- And Scarecrow's brain?

01:29:30.267 --> 01:29:34.187
Why, anybody can have a brain.
That's a very mediocre commodity.

01:29:34.355 --> 01:29:37.232
Every pusillanimous creature
that crawls on the earth...

01:29:37.483 --> 01:29:40.860
...or slinks through slimy seas
has a brain.

01:29:41.028 --> 01:29:43.238
Back where I come from,
we have universities...

01:29:43.405 --> 01:29:46.782
...seats of great learning,
where men go to become great thinkers.

01:29:46.991 --> 01:29:51.078
They think deep thoughts,
and with no more brains than you have.

01:29:51.246 --> 01:29:55.249
But they have one thing
you haven't got. A diploma.

01:29:55.416 --> 01:29:59.461
Therefore, by virtue
of the authority vested in me...

01:29:59.629 --> 01:30:03.465
...by the Universitatus Committeeatum
E Pluribus Unum...

01:30:03.633 --> 01:30:05.801
...I hereby confer upon you...

01:30:05.969 --> 01:30:10.931
...the honorary degree of Th. D.
- Th. D.?

01:30:11.140 --> 01:30:13.475
That's Doctor of Thinkology.

01:30:13.726 --> 01:30:16.436
The sum of the square roots of
two sides of an isosceles triangle...

01:30:16.688 --> 01:30:19.565
...is equal to the square root
of the remaining side.

01:30:20.817 --> 01:30:22.776
Oh, joy! Rapture!

01:30:22.944 --> 01:30:24.695
I've got a brain!

01:30:24.862 --> 01:30:27.155
- How can I thank you enough?
- Well, you can't.

01:30:27.323 --> 01:30:31.243
As for you, my fine friend, you're
a victim of disorganized thinking.

01:30:31.411 --> 01:30:35.163
You are under the delusion that
because you run away from danger...

01:30:35.331 --> 01:30:39.251
...you have no courage.
You're confusing courage with wisdom.

01:30:39.419 --> 01:30:43.380
Back where I come from,
we have men who are called "heroes. "

01:30:43.548 --> 01:30:46.717
Once a year, they take
their fortitude out of mothballs...

01:30:46.884 --> 01:30:49.136
...and parade it down the main street.

01:30:49.304 --> 01:30:51.513
And they have no more courage
than you have.

01:30:51.681 --> 01:30:56.767
But they have one thing
that you haven't got. A medal.

01:30:56.935 --> 01:30:58.269
Therefore...

01:30:58.437 --> 01:31:02.023
...for meritorious conduct,
extraordinary valor...

01:31:02.190 --> 01:31:05.318
...conspicuous bravery
against wicked witches...

01:31:05.485 --> 01:31:08.738
...I award you the Triple Cross.

01:31:08.905 --> 01:31:11.532
You are now a member
of the Legion of Courage.

01:31:16.079 --> 01:31:17.955
Shucks, folks, I'm speechless.

01:31:19.124 --> 01:31:23.127
As for you, my galvanized friend,
you want a heart.

01:31:23.295 --> 01:31:25.921
You don't know how lucky you are
not to have one.

01:31:26.089 --> 01:31:30.343
Hearts will never be practical
until they can be made unbreakable.

01:31:31.053 --> 01:31:33.262
But I still want one.

01:31:33.555 --> 01:31:37.600
Back where I come from, there are men
who do nothing all day but good deeds.

01:31:37.768 --> 01:31:40.269
They are called phil...

01:31:41.521 --> 01:31:44.815
Good-deed-doers. And their hearts
are no bigger than yours.

01:31:44.983 --> 01:31:49.195
But they have one thing
you haven't got. A testimonial.

01:31:49.363 --> 01:31:52.156
Therefore, in consideration
of your kindness...

01:31:52.324 --> 01:31:55.159
...I take pleasure at this time
in presenting you...

01:31:55.327 --> 01:31:58.954
...with a small token
of our esteem and affection.

01:31:59.122 --> 01:32:02.041
And remember,
my sentimental friend...

01:32:02.209 --> 01:32:05.336
...that a heart is not judged
by how much you love...

01:32:05.504 --> 01:32:08.506
...but by how much you are loved
by others.

01:32:08.714 --> 01:32:10.006
Ah.

01:32:11.425 --> 01:32:13.760
Oh! It ticks!

01:32:13.928 --> 01:32:16.304
Listen! Look, it ticks!

01:32:16.972 --> 01:32:19.557
Read what my medal says. "Courage. "

01:32:19.725 --> 01:32:22.060
Ain't it the truth!
Ain't it the truth!

01:32:22.228 --> 01:32:23.853
Oh, they're all wonderful.

01:32:24.021 --> 01:32:26.398
Hey, what about Dorothy?

01:32:26.565 --> 01:32:30.610
Yes, how about Dorothy?
- Yeah. Dorothy next.

01:32:30.778 --> 01:32:34.322
I don't think there's anything
in that black bag for me.

01:32:34.490 --> 01:32:36.533
You force me into
a cataclysmic decision.

01:32:36.701 --> 01:32:40.745
The only way to get Dorothy to Kansas
is for me to take her myself.

01:32:42.248 --> 01:32:45.583
Oh, will you? Could you? Oh!

01:32:46.168 --> 01:32:48.378
But are you clever enough
to manage it?

01:32:48.546 --> 01:32:52.632
Child, you cut me to the quick!
I'm an old Kansas man myself...

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:55.552
...born and bred
in the western wilderness...

01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:59.848
...premier balloonist par excellence to the
Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company.

01:33:00.015 --> 01:33:04.811
Until one day, while performing
feats of stratospheric skill...

01:33:04.979 --> 01:33:07.355
...never before attempted
by civilized man...

01:33:07.523 --> 01:33:12.110
...an unfortunate phenomena occurred.
The balloon failed to return to the fair.

01:33:12.278 --> 01:33:14.404
- It did?
- Weren't you frightened?

01:33:14.572 --> 01:33:18.074
You are talking to a man who has
laughed in the face of death...

01:33:18.242 --> 01:33:22.911
...sneered at doom and chuckled
at catastrophe. I was petrified.

01:33:23.079 --> 01:33:24.747
Suddenly the wind changed...

01:33:24.914 --> 01:33:28.250
...and the balloon floated down
into this noble city...

01:33:28.418 --> 01:33:33.630
...where I was instantly acclaimed Oz,
the first wizard deluxe!

01:33:33.798 --> 01:33:36.633
Times being what they were,
I accepted the job...

01:33:36.801 --> 01:33:41.096
...retaining my balloon
against the advent of a quick getaway.

01:33:41.264 --> 01:33:43.390
And in that balloon, dear Dorothy...

01:33:43.558 --> 01:33:48.562
...you and I will return to
the land of E Pluribus Unum.

01:33:53.943 --> 01:33:57.613
My friends. I mean, my friends!

01:34:02.577 --> 01:34:07.039
This is positively the finest
exhibition ever to be shown...

01:34:07.207 --> 01:34:09.166
...be that as it may.

01:34:09.334 --> 01:34:13.003
I, your Wizard per ardua ad alta...

01:34:13.171 --> 01:34:15.506
...am about to embark
upon a hazardous...

01:34:15.673 --> 01:34:18.550
...and technically
unexplainable journey...

01:34:18.718 --> 01:34:22.012
...into the outer stratosphere!

01:34:25.391 --> 01:34:26.725
To confer, converse...

01:34:26.893 --> 01:34:30.479
...and otherwise hobnob
with my brother wizards.

01:34:30.647 --> 01:34:34.232
And I hereby decree
that until what time...

01:34:34.399 --> 01:34:36.734
...if any, that I return...

01:34:36.902 --> 01:34:41.656
...the Scarecrow, by virtue
of his highly superior brains...

01:34:41.824 --> 01:34:43.699
...shall rule in my stead...

01:34:43.867 --> 01:34:48.454
...assisted by the Tin Man,
by virtue of his magnificent heart...

01:34:48.622 --> 01:34:52.458
...and the Lion,
by virtue of his courage.

01:34:52.626 --> 01:34:55.253
Obey them as you would me.
Thank you.

01:34:59.091 --> 01:35:02.093
Oh, Toto! Come back! Toto!

01:35:02.261 --> 01:35:04.679
Don't go without me.
I'll be right back.

01:35:04.847 --> 01:35:05.888
Stop that dog!

01:35:06.056 --> 01:35:10.810
This is a highly irregular procedure.
This is absolutely unprecedented!

01:35:10.978 --> 01:35:14.063
- Ruined my exit!
Come back! Come back!

01:35:14.231 --> 01:35:16.774
Don't go without me!
Please come back!

01:35:16.942 --> 01:35:20.278
I can't come back!
I don't know how it works!

01:35:20.445 --> 01:35:21.946
Goodbye, folks!

01:35:22.114 --> 01:35:24.240
Goodbye!

01:35:27.911 --> 01:35:30.538
Oh, now I'll never get home.

01:35:30.998 --> 01:35:33.332
Stay with us then, Dorothy.

01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:35.209
We all love you.

01:35:35.377 --> 01:35:37.879
We don't want you to go.

01:35:38.046 --> 01:35:40.381
That's very kind of you...

01:35:40.549 --> 01:35:43.634
...but this could never be like Kansas.

01:35:43.802 --> 01:35:48.013
Auntie Em must have stopped wondering
what happened to me by now.

01:35:48.180 --> 01:35:51.224
Oh, Scarecrow,
what am I going to do?

01:35:52.852 --> 01:35:54.227
Look!

01:35:54.645 --> 01:35:56.521
Here's someone who can help you!

01:36:30.222 --> 01:36:34.309
- Will you help me? Can you help me?
- You don't need help any longer.

01:36:34.477 --> 01:36:37.312
You've always had the power
to go back to Kansas.

01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:40.398
- I have?
- Then why didn't you tell her before?

01:36:40.566 --> 01:36:44.569
Because she wouldn't have believed me.
She had to learn it for herself.

01:36:44.737 --> 01:36:47.155
What have you learned, Dorothy?

01:36:47.365 --> 01:36:48.990
Well...

01:36:50.493 --> 01:36:52.243
I think that it...

01:36:52.411 --> 01:36:56.414
...that it wasn't enough just to want
to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em.

01:36:56.582 --> 01:37:01.251
And it's that if I ever go looking
for my heart's desire again...

01:37:01.419 --> 01:37:04.838
...I won't look any further
than my own back yard...

01:37:05.006 --> 01:37:07.341
...because if it isn't there...

01:37:07.509 --> 01:37:10.594
...I never really lost it to begin with.

01:37:10.762 --> 01:37:11.887
Is that right?

01:37:12.347 --> 01:37:13.847
That's all it is.

01:37:14.015 --> 01:37:17.184
But that's so easy!
I should've thought of it for you.

01:37:17.352 --> 01:37:21.105
- I should've felt it in my heart.
- She had to find it out for herself.

01:37:21.272 --> 01:37:24.775
Now those magic slippers will
take you home in two seconds.

01:37:24.943 --> 01:37:27.486
- Toto too?
- Toto too.

01:37:27.696 --> 01:37:29.738
- Now?
- Whenever you wish.

01:37:29.906 --> 01:37:33.409
Oh, dear.
That's too wonderful to be true!

01:37:35.161 --> 01:37:36.245
Oh, it's...

01:37:36.413 --> 01:37:39.873
It's gonna be so hard
to say goodbye.

01:37:40.041 --> 01:37:42.418
I love you all too.

01:37:44.587 --> 01:37:46.755
Goodbye, Tin Man.

01:37:46.923 --> 01:37:49.174
Oh, don't cry.

01:37:49.384 --> 01:37:52.386
You'll rust so dreadfully.

01:37:53.096 --> 01:37:56.223
Here. Here's your oilcan.

01:37:57.726 --> 01:38:00.602
- Goodbye.
- Now I know I've got a heart...

01:38:00.770 --> 01:38:02.855
...because it's breaking.

01:38:06.067 --> 01:38:09.528
Goodbye, Lion.
I know it isn't right...

01:38:09.696 --> 01:38:13.448
...but I'm gonna miss the way
you used to holler for help...

01:38:13.615 --> 01:38:16.117
...before you found your courage.

01:38:16.285 --> 01:38:20.371
I would never have found it
if it hadn't been for you.

01:38:25.085 --> 01:38:28.171
I think I'll miss you most of all.

01:38:33.093 --> 01:38:36.220
- Are you ready now?
- Yes.

01:38:37.848 --> 01:38:40.099
Say goodbye, Toto.

01:38:42.644 --> 01:38:46.355
- Yes, I'm ready now.
- Then close your eyes...

01:38:46.523 --> 01:38:49.525
...and tap your heels
together three times...

01:38:51.695 --> 01:38:53.738
...and think to yourself:

01:38:53.906 --> 01:38:56.908
"There's no place like home.

01:38:57.076 --> 01:39:00.411
There's no place like home. "

01:39:00.579 --> 01:39:26.061
There's no place like home.

01:39:28.189 --> 01:39:30.899
Wake up, honey.
- There's no place like home.

01:39:31.984 --> 01:39:34.486
There's no place like home.

01:39:36.447 --> 01:39:38.240
There's no...

01:39:41.035 --> 01:39:44.538
Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.

01:39:44.705 --> 01:39:46.790
Oh, Auntie Em, it's you!

01:39:46.958 --> 01:39:49.960
- Yes, darling.
Hello there! Anybody home?

01:39:50.128 --> 01:39:53.797
I dropped by because I heard
the little girl got caught in the big...

01:39:53.965 --> 01:39:57.759
- Well, she seems all right now.
- She got quite a bump on the head.

01:39:57.927 --> 01:40:00.470
We kind of thought
she was gonna leave us.

01:40:00.638 --> 01:40:03.348
But I did leave you.
That's just the trouble.

01:40:03.516 --> 01:40:05.517
And I tried to get back for days!

01:40:05.685 --> 01:40:07.644
There, there, lie quiet now.

01:40:07.812 --> 01:40:10.897
- You just had a bad dream.
- Sure.

01:40:11.065 --> 01:40:12.649
Remember me...

01:40:12.817 --> 01:40:15.068
...your old pal, Hunk?

01:40:15.236 --> 01:40:17.863
And me, Hickory?

01:40:18.030 --> 01:40:19.865
You couldn't forget my face,
could you?

01:40:20.032 --> 01:40:23.785
No. But it wasn't a dream.
It was a place.

01:40:23.953 --> 01:40:26.621
And you and you and you...

01:40:26.789 --> 01:40:28.707
...and you were there.

01:40:29.959 --> 01:40:31.835
But you couldn't have been,
could you?

01:40:32.003 --> 01:40:34.004
We dream lots
of silly things when we...

01:40:34.172 --> 01:40:38.174
No, Aunt Em, this was
a real, truly live place.

01:40:38.341 --> 01:40:41.427
And I remember that some of it
wasn't very nice...

01:40:41.595 --> 01:40:43.554
...but most of it was beautiful.

01:40:43.722 --> 01:40:47.600
But just the same, all I kept saying
to everybody was, "I want to go home!"

01:40:47.767 --> 01:40:49.852
And they sent me home.

01:40:51.688 --> 01:40:53.522
Doesn't anybody believe me?

01:40:53.690 --> 01:40:55.774
Of course we believe you, Dorothy.

01:40:55.942 --> 01:40:58.444
But anyway, Toto, we're home!

01:40:58.612 --> 01:41:01.447
Home! And this is my room...

01:41:01.615 --> 01:41:03.199
...and you're all here.

01:41:03.366 --> 01:41:06.577
And I'm not going to leave here
ever, ever again...

01:41:06.745 --> 01:41:08.704
...because I love you all.

01:41:08.872 --> 01:41:12.333
And oh, Auntie Em...

01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:15.544
...there's no place like home!
