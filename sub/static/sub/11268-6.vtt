        got no pearls ¶         

00:22.555 --> 00:24.490

    I'm a lucky girl ¶          

00:24.557 --> 00:27.192
 ¶ I got the sun in the morning 
    and the moon at night ¶

         a lovely day ¶

         got no banks ¶         

00:55.355 --> 00:57.956
        ¶ Still I'd like        
     to express my thanks ¶     

00:58.024 --> 01:02.528
 ¶ I got the sun in the morning 
    and the moon at night ¶

        in the morning ¶

01:10.770 --> 01:12.538
Good morning,                   
Carla.                          

01:12.639 --> 01:14.239
    What's so good about it?    

01:16.810 --> 01:18.711
      (theme song begins)       

01:20.780 --> 01:23.182
    ¶ Making your way

        ¶ Taking a break

         to get away? ¶

  ¶ Sometimes you want to go ¶  

01:39.966 --> 01:44.403

    knows your name ¶

        glad you came ¶         

01:50.377 --> 01:52.578
         ¶ You wanna be         
      where you can see ¶       

01:52.645 --> 01:55.147
         ¶ Our troubles         
    are all the same ¶          

01:55.215 --> 01:59.418

  everybody knows your name ¶

02:05.925 --> 02:10.496
      ¶ You wanna go where      
  everybody knows your name. ¶  

02:21.007 --> 02:22.941
              ¶ ¶               

02:28.648 --> 02:31.016
        Oh, hey, Woody,         

02:31.084 --> 02:32.184
here's my video                 
camera.                         

02:32.419 --> 02:33.686
WOODY: Oh,                      

02:33.820 --> 02:35.954
                            wow!

02:36.022 --> 02:38.991
                     Looks kinda
                    complicated.

02:39.092 --> 02:42.327
That's, that's just             
the case, Woody.                

02:42.429 --> 02:44.830
                    Uh-oh.      

02:44.898 --> 02:47.499
No, Woody, it's not             
as complicated as it looks.     

02:47.567 --> 02:49.368
I'll, uh, I'll talk ya          
through it.                     

02:49.469 --> 02:50.536
          Uh-oh.                

02:52.038 --> 02:53.272
            Whatcha doin', Wood?

02:53.340 --> 02:55.708
      Oh, well, uh, I want Kelly
             to meet my parents,

02:55.775 --> 02:57.810
         and, uh, I can't afford
        to fly her out there,   

02:57.877 --> 02:59.812
        so I figured what better
            way to introduce her

02:59.879 --> 03:01.847
         to my parents in person
                than on tape?   

03:03.550 --> 03:05.484
Don't forget, Woody, you gotta  
set your white balance.         

03:05.552 --> 03:06.618
                    What's that?

03:06.686 --> 03:08.354
Well, the tape might            
be a little tinted,             

03:08.421 --> 03:10.189
so you gotta balance it         
out by, uh,                     

03:10.256 --> 03:12.324
pointing the lens               
at a flat white surface.        

03:12.392 --> 03:13.625
Hey, Lilith,                    

03:13.760 --> 03:16.962
we were just talking            
about you.                      

03:17.030 --> 03:19.798
Carla, I'm long                 
past caring                     

03:19.866 --> 03:22.034
what anyone in this bar         
has to say about me.            

03:24.471 --> 03:26.171
              What did they say?

03:27.841 --> 03:30.409
I am the one who's gonna        
be all bloated.                 

03:30.477 --> 03:31.977
  I'm the one who's gonna gain  
        all the weight,         

03:32.045 --> 03:33.946
be up all night eating ice cream
          and pickles,          

03:34.014 --> 03:36.115
    and I'm gonna be the one    
  who's vomiting all morning.   

03:36.182 --> 03:37.282
                    Yeah? Try   
                      doing that

03:37.350 --> 03:38.517
              with Vera standing
                over you saying,

03:38.585 --> 03:40.786
 "You gotta clean up your act,  
            mister."            

03:41.888 --> 03:44.156
     Can you believe this?      

03:44.224 --> 03:46.525
     I'm not even pregnant,     
      yet he is insisting       

03:46.593 --> 03:48.427
             that the child have
                  his last name.

03:48.528 --> 03:49.962
Just give me                    
one good reason                 

03:50.030 --> 03:51.864
why its last name               
can't be Howe.                  
How about this?                 

03:51.931 --> 03:53.632
     Howe's a stupid name.      

03:53.700 --> 03:55.567
        Excuse me?              

03:55.635 --> 03:56.935
 Come on. It's not even a name. 

03:57.003 --> 03:59.071
 It's more of a, of a question. 

03:59.139 --> 04:00.406
         Rebecca Howe.          

04:00.507 --> 04:01.640
Rebecca why.                    

04:01.775 --> 04:03.075
Rebecca who, what, where.       

04:03.143 --> 04:05.778
You know, I can make fun        
of your name, too.              

04:05.845 --> 04:06.879
        Oh, yeah?               

04:07.013 --> 04:08.681
     Malone.                    

04:10.183 --> 04:12.084
     Malone.                    

04:12.152 --> 04:14.420
Oh, all right, I'm not          
very good at it yet.            

04:14.521 --> 04:15.421
          Oh, really?           

04:15.488 --> 04:16.522
        Howe surprising.        

04:16.589 --> 04:17.589
        Howe remarkable.        

04:17.656 --> 04:19.158
                Knock it off!   

04:19.225 --> 04:21.160
Come on, when you were          
a kid, admit it,                

04:21.226 --> 04:22.995
didn't-didn't people            
make fun of your name?          

04:23.063 --> 04:24.563
            Yes, but that was   
                  in the context

04:24.631 --> 04:26.899
                of making fun of
              many other things.

04:26.966 --> 04:28.734
             And what makes your
                name so special?

04:28.802 --> 04:29.902
I'll tell you why.              

04:29.969 --> 04:33.305
Because Malone is a very        
proud old Irish name.           

04:33.373 --> 04:35.274
When my great                   
grandfather came                

04:35.342 --> 04:37.276
from County Cork                
to this city,                   

04:37.344 --> 04:39.545
they actually had signs         
in some of the windows          

04:39.612 --> 04:41.947
that said "No Irish             
need apply".                    

04:42.015 --> 04:43.782
His friends told him            
to change his name              

04:43.850 --> 04:45.651
to Smith or something,          
but he wouldn't do it.          

04:45.719 --> 04:47.319
He was proud                    
of his name.                    

04:47.387 --> 04:49.388
And when we have a kid,         
I want,                         

04:49.456 --> 04:51.423
want him to be proud            
of his name, too.               

04:51.491 --> 04:53.092
    There.                      

04:53.159 --> 04:55.260
Is that reason enough           
for you?                        

04:55.328 --> 04:56.395
                      No.       

04:58.298 --> 05:01.000
     Sam, you know, you wouldn't
             have these problems

05:01.067 --> 05:03.302
      if you just made an honest
         woman out of Miss Howe.

05:03.370 --> 05:05.671
Ooh, what're you talking about, 
             Woody?             

05:05.739 --> 05:08.073
 Well, back in Hanover we have  
     this little tradition.     

05:08.141 --> 05:09.408
     It's called marriage.      

05:09.476 --> 05:10.809
                It's to avoid   

05:10.877 --> 05:14.313
    another little tradition    
        called hellfire.        

05:14.381 --> 05:15.748
Woody,                          
come on, man.                   

05:15.882 --> 05:17.583
This is the '90s.               
You know,                       

05:17.650 --> 05:20.652
  plenty of people have babies  
     without being married.     

05:22.088 --> 05:23.655
             Oh, what? You got a
              problem with that?

05:23.723 --> 05:25.657
  Well, if you want the truth,  

05:25.725 --> 05:27.659
        I do think it's         
    a little irresponsible.     

05:27.727 --> 05:30.763
  And remember, this is coming  
      from Norm Peterson.       

05:30.830 --> 05:32.898
        I can't believe this.   

05:32.966 --> 05:34.600
         You guys feel          
         the same way?          

05:34.668 --> 05:36.535
I kind of do.                   
         Me, too.               

05:36.603 --> 05:39.805
Move to California, you freaks. 

05:41.841 --> 05:43.342
Guys, guys,                     

05:43.410 --> 05:45.477
  come on. I mean, look at me.  
  I'm not getting any younger   

05:45.545 --> 05:47.146
            and neither is...   

05:47.213 --> 05:48.380
                well, it's true.

05:48.448 --> 05:50.049
        I mean, look at how many
        years we've been wasting

05:50.116 --> 05:51.483
         looking for the perfect
                relationship.   

05:51.551 --> 05:53.118
        And what'd it get us?   
                        Nothing.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.553
At least you                    
and I are friends.              

05:54.621 --> 05:56.722
            You know, we care   
                 for each other.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.791
            And right about now,
            that's looking good.
                  Based on that,

05:58.858 --> 06:00.459
we-we want to                   

06:00.527 --> 06:02.561
        hang out together and   
                  have a family.
     Yeah.                      

06:02.629 --> 06:03.862
Sam, if you feel that way,      

06:03.930 --> 06:05.364
  why don't you just go ahead   
        and get married?        

06:05.432 --> 06:07.866
            Ooh, that's an awful
                big step, Woody.

06:07.934 --> 06:09.902
                     Hey, Sammy,

06:10.003 --> 06:11.603
if you want my two cents,       

06:11.705 --> 06:13.305
  I think that you and Rebecca  

06:13.373 --> 06:14.940
     having a kid together      
        is very immoral.        

06:15.008 --> 06:16.075
Oh...                           
              Now,              

06:16.176 --> 06:18.844
         you and me havin' a kid
                outta wedlock...

06:18.912 --> 06:20.846
              that'd be a blast.

06:22.682 --> 06:24.083
        People, people,         

06:24.184 --> 06:27.386
 we cannot impose our own moral 
  belief systems on these two.  

06:27.487 --> 06:28.454
                  Yes, thank you
                      very much.

06:28.521 --> 06:30.089
     The real question is:      

06:30.156 --> 06:32.358
         Will they make         
      responsible parents?      

06:32.425 --> 06:33.659
That's right!                   

06:33.727 --> 06:36.328
         And the answer         
      is an emphatic "no!"      

06:36.396 --> 06:37.696
    Hey!                        

06:37.764 --> 06:39.898
     Sam, up until now, you     
and Rebecca have not taken      

06:39.966 --> 06:41.967
into account the years          
of sacrifice                    

06:42.035 --> 06:44.536
involved in the raising         
of a child.                     

06:44.604 --> 06:45.871
     You have not reckoned      
         with the fact          

06:45.939 --> 06:47.439
 that as soon as you have one,  

06:47.507 --> 06:49.008
    your lives will be          
      irrevocably altered.      

06:49.075 --> 06:50.776
An infant demands               
constant attention.             

06:50.844 --> 06:52.177
24 hours a day.                 

06:52.245 --> 06:53.779
Seven days a week.              

06:53.847 --> 06:55.414
     It never says "please"     
          or "may I?"           

06:55.482 --> 06:56.548
        It just demands.        

06:56.616 --> 06:57.950
     Let me have a scotch.      

06:58.118 --> 07:00.519
        And say good-bye        
         to vacations.          

07:00.587 --> 07:03.188
  Say good-bye to ski weekends  

07:03.256 --> 07:05.391
      because your life is      
    baby, baby, baby.           

07:05.458 --> 07:07.593
  Can I get a drink, please?!   

07:07.694 --> 07:09.028
SAM:                            
You know something?             

07:09.162 --> 07:10.195
    I-I'm really hurt.          

07:10.263 --> 07:11.530
    I've got to admit           

07:11.598 --> 07:13.699
    that you guys don't have    
    enough faith in me          

07:13.767 --> 07:16.201
 to see that I'm really serious 
    about this thing.           

07:16.269 --> 07:17.803
                     Anyway, the
                  whole point is

07:17.871 --> 07:19.171
     Rebecca and I believe      
      in what we're doing.      

07:19.339 --> 07:20.739
          Am I right?           

07:20.874 --> 07:22.608
                Can we still get
                 out of it, Sam?

07:22.676 --> 07:23.809
                  Well...       
             What.              

07:23.910 --> 07:24.943
                      come here.

07:25.011 --> 07:26.512
Look, those guys have           
some good points.               

07:26.579 --> 07:28.947
I mean, how do we know          
we're gonna be good parents?    

07:29.015 --> 07:30.182
                        How does
                anybody know?   

07:30.250 --> 07:32.584
Maybe a little practice         
would help ease your nerves.    

07:32.652 --> 07:33.752
Would the two of you like       

07:33.820 --> 07:35.287
to take care of Frederick       
        for an evening?         

07:35.388 --> 07:36.989
It may provide you              
with some                       

07:37.057 --> 07:38.657
              confidence in your
                parenting skills

07:38.725 --> 07:40.092
as well as give us              
a break                         

07:40.160 --> 07:42.428
from that 16-year-old           
bundle of breasts               

07:42.495 --> 07:45.431
Frasier insists is God's        
gift to babysitting.            

07:50.236 --> 07:51.804
                 Would that make
                you feel better?

07:51.871 --> 07:53.672
Yeah, I think                   
it's a good idea.               

07:53.773 --> 07:55.107
    I think it's good.          
      When can we do that?      

07:55.241 --> 07:57.209
Well, let me see.               

07:57.277 --> 07:59.211
Uh, tonight,                    

07:59.279 --> 08:01.213
    oh, well, Frederick has     
         his story hour         

08:01.281 --> 08:03.215
    at the library tonight.     

08:03.283 --> 08:05.684
     Tomorrow is our Mommy      
         and Me class.          

08:05.752 --> 08:08.787
            Friday is Aqua Tots.

08:08.855 --> 08:10.689
Let me look at next month.      

08:10.757 --> 08:12.091
         Oh, well, listen, don't
                 worry about it.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.759
      All we have to do is      
    find somebody else          

08:13.827 --> 08:14.927
and take care                   
of their kids.                  

08:14.994 --> 08:16.929
             Nobody else in this
            bar has any kids.   

08:16.996 --> 08:18.163
          Carla does.           

08:18.231 --> 08:19.264
              No!               

08:19.332 --> 08:20.432
         Forget it! No!         

08:21.901 --> 08:23.002
Sam, wait a minute.             
                             No!

08:23.069 --> 08:24.670
No, look, I am not              
gonna have a baby               

08:24.738 --> 08:26.338
until I know I'll               
be a good parent.               

08:26.406 --> 08:27.840
                  Taking care of
                    Carla's kids

08:27.907 --> 08:29.575
         is not gonna prove that
        you're a good parent.   

08:29.642 --> 08:32.778
             It just proves that
                 you can survive
                    in the wild.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.780
     Carla, Sam and I want      
to take care of your kids.      

08:34.847 --> 08:35.881
     Is that okay with you?     

08:35.948 --> 08:37.082
                     All of 'em?

08:37.283 --> 08:38.283
                For how long?   

08:38.418 --> 08:39.351
        The whole night.        

08:39.419 --> 08:41.153
                And I don't have
                    to be there?

08:41.221 --> 08:42.321
              No.               

08:42.455 --> 08:44.390
                  Oh, bless you!

08:44.457 --> 08:45.958
Come on, no,                    
no, stop it!                    

08:46.026 --> 08:47.259
                Listen, stop it!
                 Come on, get...

08:47.394 --> 08:48.594
Ow!                             

08:48.728 --> 08:51.730
We'll be there                  
at 7:00.                        

08:51.831 --> 08:53.699
Now, hey, come on, honey.       

08:53.800 --> 08:54.867
    It's not too late.          

08:54.934 --> 08:57.002
     May-may-maybe Freddie      
    can squeeze us in.          

08:58.138 --> 09:00.205
                A whole night   

09:00.273 --> 09:02.508
                without my kids.

09:04.611 --> 09:06.545
     Thank you, Saint Jude,     

09:06.613 --> 09:09.682
  patron saint of lost causes.  

09:09.749 --> 09:13.819
I have prayed for this day      
         for 18 years.          

09:13.887 --> 09:15.821
 First you freed me from Diane. 

09:16.890 --> 09:18.824
         And now this!          

09:18.892 --> 09:19.992
         I am blessed!          

09:20.060 --> 09:22.394
      I am truly blessed.       

09:22.462 --> 09:24.063
     Carla, do you realize      

09:24.130 --> 09:25.597
  that you're the same height   
         kneeling down          

09:25.665 --> 09:27.299
    as you are standing up?     

09:34.307 --> 09:36.208
                Hi, Mom and Dad.

09:36.276 --> 09:39.144
          Uh, I want you to meet
        Kelly, my girlfriend.   

09:39.212 --> 09:41.146
                She's holding   
                     the camera.

09:42.649 --> 09:44.583
    She's a beautiful girl.     

09:44.651 --> 09:48.253
    Blond hair, great smile,    

09:48.321 --> 09:51.256
     sparkling personality.     

09:51.324 --> 09:53.425
I wish you could see her.       

09:54.928 --> 09:58.297
  Kelly, say hi to my parents.  

09:58.365 --> 09:59.298
                        Now!    

10:02.802 --> 10:04.136
              Hi.               

10:04.304 --> 10:05.637
  Now!                          

10:07.807 --> 10:10.075
                    Well, what'd
                      you think?

10:10.143 --> 10:13.012
            Pretty special, huh?

10:13.079 --> 10:14.947
      Kelly, say good-bye       
         to my parents.         

10:15.015 --> 10:16.148
                            Now!

10:18.885 --> 10:20.919
              Bye.              

10:20.987 --> 10:23.589
        That was great.         

10:23.656 --> 10:25.057
    Let's turn this baby on     

10:25.191 --> 10:27.760
             and shoot it before
                we get stale.   

10:27.827 --> 10:30.362
     Hey, excuse me, Wood.      

10:30.430 --> 10:32.431
Don't you think maybe your      
parents would like a shot       

10:32.499 --> 10:33.866
with the two of you in it?      

10:33.933 --> 10:35.100
        Huh? Yeah.              

10:35.168 --> 10:37.136
  What do you say we sit down   
    and chat about it?          

10:37.203 --> 10:39.038
Get a few ideas                 

10:39.105 --> 10:40.539
    cookin' here, you know--    
     a little percolatin'.      

10:40.607 --> 10:45.477
      You know, maybe a...      
     maybe a nice two shot.     

10:45.545 --> 10:47.046
You know, widen out to a master 

10:47.113 --> 10:49.114
    with a little background    
lighting for a nice halo effect.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.083
                          WOODY:
                            Wow!

10:51.151 --> 10:52.918
              Mr. Clavin, you're
                  a real expert.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.187
Oh, yeah, I'm a bit             
of a film buff there, Woody.    

10:55.255 --> 10:57.289
I, uh, I admire the works       
of all the greats.              

10:57.357 --> 11:00.059
You know, Kurosawa,             
Fellini, Hitch.                 

11:00.126 --> 11:02.061
That's, uh,                     
Hitchcock, Woody.               

11:03.363 --> 11:04.430
                      I just had
                        an idea.

11:04.597 --> 11:05.564
     Whatta you say we, uh,     

11:05.632 --> 11:06.765
                have Woody start
                 this thing off?

11:06.833 --> 11:07.800
                    I mean, he's
                    an actor.   

11:07.867 --> 11:09.134
            He can just warm the
            whole thing up, huh?

11:09.202 --> 11:10.169
                      All right,
                        Wood?   
             Yeah.              

11:10.236 --> 11:11.203
                        Okay.   

11:11.271 --> 11:13.339
          Ready and...          

11:13.406 --> 11:14.673
            action!             

11:14.741 --> 11:16.809
        Hi, Mom and Dad.        

11:16.876 --> 11:20.212
    Oh, Woody, I, uh,           
thought you were an actor.      

11:21.614 --> 11:22.781
  Let's try this again, okay?   

11:22.849 --> 11:24.049
                And remember,   

11:24.117 --> 11:25.718
        you haven't seen your   
              parents for years.

11:25.785 --> 11:27.786
            You hunger for their
             love and affection.

11:27.854 --> 11:31.056
      You want them to know just
        how badly you miss them.

11:31.157 --> 11:33.392
            You left Indiana all
            those many years ago

11:33.460 --> 11:34.660
                  to come to the
                    big city.   

11:34.728 --> 11:36.795
              You're practically
                a stranger, pal.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.867
            Action.             

11:44.404 --> 11:46.105
    I love you, Mom and Dad.    

11:48.108 --> 11:50.376
I know I should've stayed       
          on the farm.          

11:50.443 --> 11:52.044
    I don't know why I left.    

11:52.112 --> 11:54.880
Uh, I guess I was just selfish. 

11:54.948 --> 11:56.215
You know, everybody             

11:56.416 --> 11:57.649
    always leaves the farm.     

11:57.717 --> 12:00.085
      That's why America's      
    in the condition it is.     

12:01.755 --> 12:03.288
        I'm sorry.              

12:03.356 --> 12:06.058
    Can you ever forgive me?    

12:06.126 --> 12:09.428
        Please don't die        
before I come home again.       

12:12.932 --> 12:16.735
                      Oh, Woody,
             that was wonderful.

12:16.836 --> 12:19.138
  What do you say we turn this  
 thing on and shoot this baby?  

12:26.913 --> 12:29.281
Hey, Carla's still              
rounding up the kids.           

12:29.349 --> 12:30.749
We could run for it.            

12:30.817 --> 12:33.285
     Sam, no, don't worry.      

12:33.353 --> 12:35.354
  Carla's always exaggerating   
        about her kids.         

12:35.422 --> 12:36.722
      We'll be just fine.       

12:36.790 --> 12:38.624
     Okay, the kids will be     
        out in a minute.        

12:38.692 --> 12:39.858
        Just sign this.         

12:39.926 --> 12:41.160
                     What is it?

12:41.227 --> 12:42.995
It's your standard release form.

12:43.063 --> 12:45.264
     The insurance company      
          requires it.          

12:45.331 --> 12:47.433
         Just sign here         
     and initial the spots.     

12:49.169 --> 12:51.403
    Okay, kids, come on in!     

12:57.644 --> 12:59.611
                    Oh... aren't
                  they adorable?

12:59.679 --> 13:02.548
                Look, they're   
                all lined up.   

13:02.615 --> 13:05.751
Bet it's not                    
the first time, either.         

13:05.819 --> 13:08.887
                    Look at you.
            You look so cute.   

13:08.955 --> 13:11.323
 It's like <i>The Sound of Music.</i>  

13:11.391 --> 13:13.092
  Oh, I wish I had a whistle.   

13:13.159 --> 13:15.127
Here, Miss Howe.                

13:15.195 --> 13:16.562
                  Oh, thank you.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.097
                 I always wanted
                     to do this.

13:18.164 --> 13:19.498
                        Okay.   

13:19.599 --> 13:23.435
 Now, when I blow the whistle,  
    you say your name.          

13:23.503 --> 13:26.772
                (whistle trills)

13:26.840 --> 13:28.207
     Serafina.                  

13:28.274 --> 13:30.309
 And I'm spending the night     
     with my boyfriend.         

13:30.377 --> 13:32.611
                          (gags)

13:43.490 --> 13:45.724
    Now isn't it more fun having
      this time with your family

13:45.792 --> 13:48.060
                than going on   
            some silly old date?

13:48.128 --> 13:49.595
     You better let me go.      

13:49.662 --> 13:52.364
 My boyfriend's a retired cop.  

13:52.465 --> 13:54.433
        No, no, no, no,         
  you'll, you'll want to stay.  

13:54.501 --> 13:55.934
     You'll miss the games.     

13:56.002 --> 13:57.703
     I'm missing them now.      

13:57.804 --> 13:59.972
All right, everybody fed?       

14:00.040 --> 14:01.907
             KIDS:              
        Yes, Mr. Malone.        

14:01.975 --> 14:03.008
              SAM:              
             Fine.              

14:03.109 --> 14:05.978
     Now may I please have      
         my pants back?         

14:06.046 --> 14:07.946
                 Check the oven.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.788
            (crying)            

14:15.855 --> 14:17.056
  Oh, what's the matter, Lud?   

14:17.123 --> 14:18.991
                    I can't find
                 Mr. Tibbington.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.427
Oh, honey, don't cry.           

14:21.494 --> 14:24.263
 Who is Mr. Tibbington?         
Is that your kitty cat?         

14:24.330 --> 14:27.399
          No. He's my eight-foot
                boa constrictor.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.868
Well, we'll certainly keep      
our eyes out for him.           

14:34.941 --> 14:36.175
    Wait, wait... hold up...    
          (muttering)           

14:36.242 --> 14:37.910
There's only seven of us.       
        Where's Anthony?        

14:37.977 --> 14:38.977
He's out doing something.       

14:39.045 --> 14:39.845
                What's he doing?

14:39.913 --> 14:41.180
             Time.              

14:42.482 --> 14:45.384
Wait. Stop eating for a minute. 
          Stop eating.          

14:45.452 --> 14:47.853
          Here we are,          
    at the head of the table    

14:47.921 --> 14:49.722
    just like real parents.     

14:49.823 --> 14:51.457
  I think we should say grace.  

14:55.829 --> 14:59.164
        Now I know we're        
  not the real parents, but...  

14:59.232 --> 15:02.601
Sam, don't play footsie with me 
     when I'm saying grace.     

15:02.669 --> 15:04.737
I'm not playing footsie.        

15:06.306 --> 15:08.574
    Oh, it's Mr. Tibbing...     
        (screams)...ton!        

15:08.641 --> 15:10.976
        (boys cheering)         

15:15.915 --> 15:18.717
You know, now that Sam's busy   
with this baby thing,           

15:18.785 --> 15:20.619
you guys are either going       
to have to live vicariously     

15:20.687 --> 15:22.054
through somebody else,          

15:22.122 --> 15:24.423
     or get your own lives.     

15:24.491 --> 15:26.558
                        (scoffs)

15:26.626 --> 15:28.360
She's right, you know.          

15:28.428 --> 15:29.361
                        NORM:   
                        Wood?   

15:29.462 --> 15:30.829
                      Thank you.

15:30.897 --> 15:34.733
    Listen, when you and, uh,   
         Kelly go out on a date,

15:34.801 --> 15:37.036
                     what do you
                guys do, huh?   

15:37.103 --> 15:39.538
        (chuckles)              

15:39.606 --> 15:41.473
Well...                         

15:41.574 --> 15:44.176
last night we played three games
    of miniature golf           

15:44.244 --> 15:46.979
and stopped for ice cream       
    at the Freeze 'n' Frost.    

15:47.047 --> 15:48.380
                            Ooh!

15:48.448 --> 15:50.115
              A little miniature
                golf there, huh?

15:50.183 --> 15:52.484
A little ice cream              
     action, huh?               

15:52.552 --> 15:54.553
                         Huh?   

15:54.621 --> 15:57.122
            Yeah, that Woody.   
    Yeah.                       

15:57.190 --> 16:01.326
    He's an ice-cream-eating,   
          miniature-golfing guy.

16:01.394 --> 16:04.463
Look at us trying to sponge off 
other people's lives.           

16:04.531 --> 16:05.864
We're pathetic.                 

16:07.834 --> 16:10.836
        Hey, Phil,              
     new pants there, huh?      

16:10.904 --> 16:12.404
              Yep.              

16:13.406 --> 16:15.207
That Phil...                    

16:15.275 --> 16:18.711
he's a pants-wearing, guy.      

16:18.778 --> 16:22.748
So, Carla, how do you intend    
to spend your night of freedom? 

16:22.816 --> 16:24.249
      Ah, nothing special.      

16:24.317 --> 16:27.486
I'm going to check into the, uh,
Ritz for a night of R & R.      

16:27.587 --> 16:29.054
        Oh. Sounds nice.        

16:29.122 --> 16:30.322
            Yeah, I think so.   

16:30.423 --> 16:33.625
      I know Roy and Ralph      
are looking forward to it.      

16:33.693 --> 16:35.227
                        Oh...   

16:35.295 --> 16:37.429
              remember the Ritz-
            Carlton, darling?   

16:37.497 --> 16:39.531
                      A night of
            unbridled passion   

16:39.599 --> 16:42.434
          that remains unmatched
                    to this day.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.471
We've never been                
to the Ritz-Carlton, Frasier.   

16:48.041 --> 16:49.608
                    Did I say   
            the Ritz-Carlton?   

16:49.676 --> 16:51.977
                         I meant
            the Four Seasons.   

16:52.045 --> 16:54.046
Strike two.                     

16:56.316 --> 16:59.218
          So, did you get a load
            of Phil's new pants?

17:02.789 --> 17:04.957
    You know, an older fellow   
            like that, you know,

17:05.025 --> 17:07.492
         you wouldn't think he'd
    be able to get away with,   

17:07.560 --> 17:09.627
    you know, still looking good
            in a pair of slacks.

17:09.695 --> 17:12.131
                But, uh, darn if
         he doesn't pull it off.

17:12.198 --> 17:14.666
        Lilith, please blink.   

17:19.571 --> 17:22.473
  Okay, I hope you all enjoyed  
        the dinner              

17:22.541 --> 17:24.076
as much as the wall did.        

17:24.144 --> 17:26.145
And I also want                 
you to know                     

17:26.212 --> 17:28.513
  that Rebecca really enjoyed   
 the dead-rat-in-the-bun joke.  

17:28.581 --> 17:29.348
    That's very funny.          

17:29.416 --> 17:33.419
                    (sobbing)   

17:33.486 --> 17:36.021
Come on, honey, just pull       
    yourself together.          

17:36.089 --> 17:38.424
    You're going to frighten    
        the kids.               

17:38.525 --> 17:40.359
                I don't think   
            I can take any more.

17:40.427 --> 17:41.960
Oh, come on,                    
of course you can.              

17:42.028 --> 17:43.929
You can't quit now.             
We've onl...                    

17:43.997 --> 17:47.866
                Okay, who-who   
                  took my watch?

17:47.934 --> 17:49.068
                    (mutters)   

17:49.135 --> 17:50.836
                        REBECCA:
                You see that?   

17:50.904 --> 17:52.137
      This is not a home.       

17:52.205 --> 17:53.539
  This is a house of horrors.   

17:53.606 --> 17:54.440
No, you're just...              

17:54.507 --> 17:55.741
                 I mean, my God,

17:55.809 --> 17:58.477
                they Crazy-glued
            the dryer door shut.

17:58.545 --> 18:00.546
Yeah, I know, but we got        
you out, didn't we?             

18:00.613 --> 18:04.049
            But I'm still dizzy.

18:04.117 --> 18:06.585
      I'm going to leave!       

18:06.686 --> 18:09.188
No, no, come on, we can't quit. 
Now, what are you going to do...

18:09.255 --> 18:10.889
            listen,             
 when we have kids of our own?  

18:10.957 --> 18:13.392
        Are you going to quit   
      when the going gets tough?
         I don't know.          

18:13.460 --> 18:15.094
    Well, no! Honey, listen.    

18:15.161 --> 18:18.731
 We're almost up to bath time,  
    then we'll be home free.    

18:18.798 --> 18:20.699
                        Okay?   
             Okay.              

18:20.767 --> 18:22.134
All right, now, uh, who's first?

18:22.202 --> 18:24.136
          I'm ready for my bath,
                      Miss Howe.

18:24.237 --> 18:26.472
                And I'm a dirty,
                      dirty boy.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.240
(shrieking, sobbing):           
     Ah, Sam!                   

18:28.308 --> 18:30.843
                Would you get   
                     over there!

18:35.782 --> 18:37.850
        Okay, kids, now let's   
          just get a shot of you

18:37.917 --> 18:40.652
        in front of the whole   
                 bar, all right?

18:40.720 --> 18:42.121
                     Yeah, okay.

18:42.188 --> 18:44.857
Cliffy, you want                
I should take off?              

18:44.924 --> 18:46.592
No, no, no, you stay right      
      where you are, Norm.      

18:46.659 --> 18:48.494
    Uh, you're what we call     
          atmosphere.           

18:48.561 --> 18:50.496
Wait a minute.                  
What's that?                    

18:50.563 --> 18:51.630
         Atmosphere, that's, uh,

18:51.698 --> 18:52.898
                you know, people
              in the background.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.066
          You're sitting around,
             drinking your beer.

18:54.134 --> 18:55.634
              You know, it looks
          like you belong there.

18:55.702 --> 18:56.702
All right!                      

18:56.770 --> 18:59.405
Hey, everybody,                 
I'm atmosphere!                 

18:59.472 --> 19:01.607
             Hey, Cliff, could I
             be atmosphere, too?

19:01.675 --> 19:03.609
Pauly, Pauly, Pauly, uh...      

19:03.677 --> 19:07.112
  Personally I love you, Paul,  
  but, uh, the camera doesn't.  

19:07.180 --> 19:08.280
             Scoot!             

19:13.553 --> 19:15.187
    All right now, everybody,   

19:15.255 --> 19:17.956
        57th take is a charm.   

19:18.024 --> 19:19.324
             Right?             

19:19.392 --> 19:22.461
             Now...             
  <i>The Message Home,</i> scene one.  

19:22.529 --> 19:23.829
            Action.             

19:23.897 --> 19:25.497
                 Hello,         
        Mr. and Mrs. Boyd.      

19:25.565 --> 19:27.166
                            Cut!

19:27.233 --> 19:28.300
                 (clears throat)

19:28.368 --> 19:31.403
                Kelly, Kelly,   
            Kelly, come here.   

19:31.471 --> 19:34.573
         What I'm looking for is
        the energy of take 36   

19:34.641 --> 19:36.508
            and the innocence   
                     of take 11.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.477
                Do you think you
             can do that for me?

19:38.545 --> 19:41.046
I'm awfully tired,              
Mr. Clavin.                     

19:41.147 --> 19:43.215
                    That a girl!

19:44.284 --> 19:46.151
                        Okay.   

19:46.219 --> 19:48.120
      Scene one, take 58.       

19:48.855 --> 19:50.222
            Action!             

19:50.323 --> 19:51.824
     Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Boyd.     

19:51.891 --> 19:53.392
                            Cut!

19:53.460 --> 19:56.061
             Kelly, uh, you, you
        mind explaining to me   

19:56.129 --> 19:58.464
             just what you think
              you're doing here?

19:58.531 --> 20:01.834
Cliffy, lighten up, guy.        

20:01.901 --> 20:04.036
You're just getting a little    
serious about this, aren't you? 

20:04.104 --> 20:05.371
      All right, who told       
    the atmosphere to talk?!    

20:05.572 --> 20:07.873
                Go on, you're   
                    out of here!

20:07.941 --> 20:09.508
                Pauly, your ship
                just came in.   

20:09.576 --> 20:11.043
            Come in here, buddy.

20:11.144 --> 20:12.745
                          WOODY:
                        Hey, uh,

20:12.812 --> 20:15.147
    Mr. Clavin, I don't think   
    I want to make this tape.   

20:15.215 --> 20:16.248
        Me neither.             

20:16.349 --> 20:17.116
                All right, fine!

20:17.183 --> 20:18.317
                    Both of you,
                get out of here!

20:18.385 --> 20:19.518
              Everybody get out!

20:19.586 --> 20:20.853
              I can do the whole
                 project myself!

20:20.920 --> 20:22.388
Cliff, please!                  
                          What?!

20:22.455 --> 20:23.889
 Now you'll never get what you  
 want by badgering these kids.  

20:23.957 --> 20:24.923
You've got to make              
them feel safe.                 

20:25.025 --> 20:26.859
        After all, it's         
    just a videotape.           

20:26.926 --> 20:29.161
Now listen, why don't you       
     pull up a chair here,      

20:29.229 --> 20:31.130
try to calm yourself down.      

20:31.197 --> 20:32.498
         Have a beer...         
                  I'm all right.

20:32.565 --> 20:35.467
    We'll see if we can, uh,    
get this thing done, huh? Okay? 

20:35.535 --> 20:37.670
        All right, all right.   
                  I'm all right.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.772
         Kelly, Woody.          

20:39.839 --> 20:44.810
    Now, Kelly, just do whatever
         comes naturally to you.

20:44.878 --> 20:48.313
             Relax, be yourself.

20:48.381 --> 20:49.715
                    No pressure.

20:49.783 --> 20:57.423
     And simply say "hello"     
      to Woody's parents.       

20:57.524 --> 20:59.658
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Boyd.       

20:59.726 --> 21:01.727
I'm Kelly Gaines.               

21:03.396 --> 21:05.564
                        FRASIER:
                Kelly, you...   

21:05.632 --> 21:08.233
  you just don't have a clue,   
            do you?             

21:10.236 --> 21:12.004
         That's a wrap.         

21:17.844 --> 21:19.111
Boy, I'll tell you              
one thing.                      

21:19.179 --> 21:21.313
Anybody who thinks              
parenthood is easy,             

21:21.381 --> 21:24.149
should try giving baths         
to those monsters.              

21:24.217 --> 21:26.251
I learned a lot.                

21:26.319 --> 21:30.322
Yeah, yeah, I learned I can hold
my breath for over a minute.    

21:32.325 --> 21:37.629
Although, I can't quite         
remember my telephone number.   

21:37.731 --> 21:39.098
                      (sputters)

21:39.232 --> 21:41.333
You know something?             

21:41.401 --> 21:44.536
 Carla's kids aren't that bad.  

21:44.604 --> 21:46.105
                Yeah, they're   
                     really not.

21:46.172 --> 21:48.040
    They're sort of rambunctious
              and high-spirited,

21:48.108 --> 21:51.944
      but, you know, all in all,
         I think they mean well.

21:52.012 --> 21:56.281
     You know, I was pretty much
  a scamp when I was a kid, too.

21:56.349 --> 21:58.517
Yeah, yeah...                   
(chuckles)                      

21:58.585 --> 22:00.152
                  I used to, uh,

22:00.253 --> 22:03.856
      empty out the salt shakers
            and put in sugar.   

22:06.593 --> 22:07.826
Boy, what a prank.              

22:10.663 --> 22:13.866
        Well, Sam, we did it.   

22:13.933 --> 22:15.167
Yeah, hey, that's right.        

22:15.235 --> 22:16.568
We passed your test,            
didn't we?                      

22:16.636 --> 22:18.237
We took care                    
of Carla's kids.                

22:18.304 --> 22:20.673
If we can do that,              
we can do anything.             

22:20.740 --> 22:22.241
You know something?             

22:22.308 --> 22:24.476
We're going to be               
just fine.                      
                            Mmm.

22:24.544 --> 22:27.146
     (light switch clicks)      
          MALE VOICE:           
Be afraid. Be very afraid.      

22:27.213 --> 22:29.915
SAM:                            
Uh-oh. Is that a prowler,       
or is that the kids?            

22:29.983 --> 22:32.651
        REBECCA (whimpering):   
      Oh, I hope it's a prowler!
