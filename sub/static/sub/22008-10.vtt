WEBVTT

00:15.390 --> 00:17.848
Don't look now, but...

00:18.018 --> 00:19.975
Look, look, look.

00:26.902 --> 00:30.191
Okay, I just watched that,
and I think I'm pregnant.

00:31.406 --> 00:32.988
And he's walking over.

00:36.495 --> 00:39.112
- God. It's Bronwyn.
- What? It's almost 11.

00:39.498 --> 00:41.990
- Don't answer it.
- I have to.

00:42.167 --> 00:45.751
Yes? Just... Hang on one second.

00:53.387 --> 00:56.004
- Can you say that again?
- Oliver threw a fit.

00:56.181 --> 00:58.639
They bumped the meeting.
We're presenting tomorrow.

00:58.809 --> 01:01.643
- I need to get back tonight. You're...
- Rebooking your flight.

01:01.812 --> 01:04.224
- Out of Newark. Is that music?
<i>- Serious?</i>

01:04.397 --> 01:07.482
- You're not out on a Tuesday, are you?
- No, no. I...

01:07.693 --> 01:10.527
- You hate Newark.
<i>- Almost as much as I hate Oliver.</i>

01:10.696 --> 01:15.532
Meeting's moved, I need a flight. Here's
my cab. Call when you get this fixed.

01:18.745 --> 01:22.739
Sorry, I wasn't avoiding you earlier.
It's my boss. She's a bitch.

03:00.055 --> 03:01.045
Found it.

03:01.390 --> 03:03.006
Got what we came for.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.173
Finish them off.

03:08.522 --> 03:12.607
The police are wrong. They think
some ex-con named Navarro killed Tom.

03:12.776 --> 03:16.190
- He didn't.
- Paris, I'd like you to meet Elizabeth.

03:16.363 --> 03:19.572
Paris and I met
when he was a saucier at Le Bernadin.

03:19.741 --> 03:24.406
- Pleasure to meet you. No, thank you.
- Shall I set a third place for lunch?

03:25.414 --> 03:29.408
You may wanna think twice. He's making
a turbot with matsutake-mushroom broth.

03:29.584 --> 03:31.541
Another time.

03:32.045 --> 03:35.709
Someone else killed Tom.
It wasn't Navarro.

03:35.882 --> 03:40.377
I wish I knew more. All I know
is that the men who died in your home...

03:40.554 --> 03:45.265
...were members of the Nash syndicate.
I believe they were hired to go after Tom.

03:45.434 --> 03:48.723
I've pursued other members of the
organization for more than a year.

03:48.895 --> 03:52.229
And they've proven to be
ignorant of the incident...

03:52.399 --> 03:55.688
...or whoever hired them
is powerful enough to keep them quiet.

04:00.449 --> 04:02.111
I didn't know you were back.

04:02.284 --> 04:05.072
- Good to see you.
- Good to be seen. How are you?

04:05.245 --> 04:09.740
- How's Aram? How are you and Aram?
- Boring. Blissful, domestic.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.991
I'm so happy for you.

04:13.003 --> 04:14.585
How's Agnes?

04:16.089 --> 04:18.172
- I should go.
- Wait. I'm here about a case...

04:18.341 --> 04:21.630
- ...you don't wanna hear it?
- I wanna hear about boring and domestic.

04:21.803 --> 04:24.341
I'll let you handle the case.

04:28.685 --> 04:31.223
What do you know about
the nerve-gas attack?

04:31.396 --> 04:35.185
Fifty-seven people died. Members of the
terrorist cell claiming responsibility...

04:35.358 --> 04:38.271
- ...have been taken into custody.
- On Monday, the Treasury...

04:38.445 --> 04:40.812
...will likely attempt
to freeze the accounts...

04:40.989 --> 04:43.481
- ...which financed the attack.
- Liz isn't coming back?

04:43.658 --> 04:46.696
Twelve hours ago,
a man known as the Informant...

04:46.870 --> 04:50.784
...accessed a list of those accounts
on the classified computers...

04:50.957 --> 04:54.041
...used by the
Senate Intelligence Committee.

04:54.252 --> 04:56.039
<i>And the list
of bank accounts he stole?</i>

04:56.213 --> 04:59.331
Reddington believes he plans
to ransom them to the account holders.

04:59.508 --> 05:01.750
Giving them a chance
to transfer their assets...

05:01.927 --> 05:05.295
- ...before the freeze goes into effect.
- Can't Treasury track transfers?

05:05.472 --> 05:08.180
They did. To terrorists in Toronto,
Barcelona and Paris.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.137
These accounts
are financing terrorism.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.142
We don't know the
account holders' identity.

05:12.312 --> 05:15.350
- What do we know about the theft?
- List was on classified computers...

05:15.524 --> 05:19.484
...at the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Senator Cooligan was at dinner...

05:19.653 --> 05:22.942
...when his badge and password were
used to access the computers.

05:23.114 --> 05:25.902
We're looking for someone who had
access to his credentials.

05:26.076 --> 05:28.693
- What do we know about his staff?
- Eleven members.

05:28.870 --> 05:31.613
All with some level
of restricted access.

05:31.915 --> 05:33.747
Two are out of the country...

05:33.917 --> 05:36.500
...and six others have solid alibis...

05:36.670 --> 05:38.832
- ...with capitol police.
- The remaining three?

05:39.005 --> 05:42.715
Two are waiting to be cleared.
They also work for the committee.

05:42.884 --> 05:46.343
- This guy, Bishop.
- Howard Bishop. Aide who has held...

05:46.513 --> 05:48.505
...positions with state, treasury, FDA...

05:48.682 --> 05:51.095
All of which have suffered leaks
from the Informant.

05:51.268 --> 05:54.386
Navabi, Ressler, locate Bishop
and get him in here for questioning.

05:54.563 --> 05:58.307
Aram, find everything you can.
Calls, texts, credit-card swipes.

05:58.483 --> 06:01.396
I wanna retrace every step he's taken
in the last 48 hours.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.651
There he is, 11:00.

06:06.825 --> 06:10.239
I explained it's a non-issue.
I'm not talking about this.

06:10.412 --> 06:11.698
Does he look uneasy?

06:11.872 --> 06:14.706
- Do you have his cell?
<i>- I do. He's not using it.</i>

06:14.875 --> 06:17.959
If Bishop's on a cell,
it's either not registered in his name...

06:18.128 --> 06:19.414
<i>...or it's a burner.</i>

06:19.588 --> 06:21.375
Yes. I understand.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.875
What do you say
we let this thing play out?

06:25.051 --> 06:28.010
- Aram, we're going to comms.
- Copy that. Comms are up.

06:30.098 --> 06:33.466
Navabi, what makes you so certain
Keen's not coming back?

06:35.478 --> 06:38.061
- Just a feeling.
- I'm worried about her.

06:38.231 --> 06:41.770
If I were her, I'd do whatever it takes
to find my husband's killer.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.404
Looks like lunch.

06:53.455 --> 06:57.540
- What do you mean, "Whatever it takes"?
- Breaking the rules, ignoring the law.

06:57.709 --> 07:00.998
- Whatever it takes.
- To find the killer? That's sweet.

07:01.171 --> 07:04.881
- Nothing sweet about a cop breaking rules.
- Says the man who never jaywalked.

07:05.050 --> 07:07.963
<i>Or had hair out of place
or a wrinkle in his suit.</i>

07:08.136 --> 07:11.629
You'd make an amazing criminal.
If you were crooked, no one would know.

07:11.806 --> 07:12.842
I would.

07:16.227 --> 07:17.968
He's on the move again.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.477
I'm meeting a friend.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.069
- He's not here.
<i>- He made us.</i>

07:31.242 --> 07:33.325
Notify M.P.D.C. and capitol police.

07:33.495 --> 07:36.829
Tell them to throw a net.
See if you can't pull the CCTV in the area.

07:36.998 --> 07:38.580
This guy's here somewhere.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.286
<i>He couldn't have gone far.</i>

07:43.838 --> 07:46.125
Excuse me,
I need to talk to somebody.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.541
I have information about a crime.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.723
- What?
<i>- Hey. It's me.</i>

07:59.896 --> 08:00.977
<i>You were right.</i>

08:01.147 --> 08:03.139
<i>That lead on Reddington
finally heated up.</i>

08:03.316 --> 08:05.683
- Keen?
<i>- Yeah. She's back.</i>

08:05.860 --> 08:07.567
<i>You want us to move in?</i>

08:07.737 --> 08:09.353
No, no, no. Leave her be.

08:09.531 --> 08:11.113
She's not going anywhere.

08:11.783 --> 08:13.399
This may take some time.

08:13.576 --> 08:16.068
We'll let things run their course.

08:16.246 --> 08:18.488
I'll handle things my end.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.698
I'll be in touch.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.172
- You're lying.
- I'm bearing witness.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.880
To a hit-and-run that happened
as the sanctions list...

08:32.053 --> 08:34.796
- ...was being stolen. It's convenient.
- A woman was killed.

08:34.972 --> 08:38.511
I gave the cops a description of the car.
Yeah. I wish I knew more. I don't.

08:38.684 --> 08:42.725
If you did see this hit-and-run,
why wait 24 hours to report it?

08:42.897 --> 08:46.356
Because I was with a married woman...

08:46.526 --> 08:49.940
...when I saw it
and my coming forward would...

08:50.113 --> 08:53.356
- ...expose her.
- Does your friend have a name?

08:53.533 --> 08:56.025
Sonia Fisher. Judge Sonia Fisher.

08:56.202 --> 08:59.695
I reported the crime,
just not who I was with when I saw it.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.331
- And Howard Bishop was with you?
- Yes.

09:02.500 --> 09:05.789
- Had he been with you all night?
<i>- She told the truth about the crime.</i>

09:05.962 --> 09:09.876
- She lied about the affair. We lied.
- My husband was suspicious.

09:10.050 --> 09:14.135
- He hired a PI to follow me.
- That's who I thought I was running from.

09:14.304 --> 09:18.048
We were meeting for lunch,
and he ran so we wouldn't be seen.

09:18.224 --> 09:21.433
I'm not proud of the affair.
It proves I'm not a thief.

09:21.603 --> 09:23.765
I did not steal the sanctions list.

09:29.986 --> 09:33.980
The Informant's name's Howard Bishop.
A staffer in Cooligan's office.

09:34.157 --> 09:35.398
Quick work, Harold.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.282
Celebratory drink?

09:37.452 --> 09:42.038
Paris makes a rye-and-absinthe cocktail
that could blind an elephant.

09:42.207 --> 09:46.326
- Nothing to celebrate yet.
- Oh, that's delicious.

09:46.878 --> 09:49.495
Wealth is such a privilege.

09:49.672 --> 09:51.834
I've learned to love it.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.964
Well, it's not emotional, like...

09:56.137 --> 10:00.723
...hearing Maria Schneider's
"The Thompson Fields" for the first time...

10:00.892 --> 10:05.728
...or watching the sun set
over the caldera in Santorini.

10:05.897 --> 10:08.731
But for pure meaningless joy,
nothing compares.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.058
We didn't catch Bishop.

10:10.235 --> 10:13.194
He turned himself in. Claimed to be
a witness to a hit-and-run.

10:13.363 --> 10:14.979
You know if he sold the list yet?

10:15.156 --> 10:17.022
No. Nor who the buyer may be.

10:17.534 --> 10:20.572
We think he's selling to an account
holder, but we can't ID them.

10:20.745 --> 10:23.158
I'm hoping you can.

10:26.459 --> 10:27.575
Elizabeth is back.

10:28.253 --> 10:29.744
So I hear. How is she?

10:30.421 --> 10:32.504
Determined to find Tom's killers.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.504
- That's understandable.
- I'm the devil on one shoulder.

10:35.677 --> 10:40.468
You're the angel on her other.
She's in troubled waters, Harold.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.348
Please help her to navigate them.

10:45.812 --> 10:49.396
- Detective Singleton, right?
- You remember.

10:49.774 --> 10:53.108
Last time we spoke,
you were getting out of the hospital.

10:53.278 --> 10:55.770
- How you feeling?
- Much better, thank you.

10:56.030 --> 10:58.272
- May I come in?
- Now's not a good time.

10:58.449 --> 11:02.113
- Can I get your card? I'll call.
- I gave you my card last time.

11:02.287 --> 11:04.404
It wasn't a good time then, either.

11:04.581 --> 11:07.665
You vanished. All these months later,
I'm waiting for your call.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.700
I went away. I just got back.

11:09.878 --> 11:12.541
Day before yesterday, 6:38 p.m.

11:13.006 --> 11:17.341
- You're watching my apartment.
- I'm trying to find your husband's killers.

11:17.719 --> 11:19.460
Thought you'd call when you got back.

11:19.637 --> 11:22.846
Then again, I thought you'd call
before you left.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.183
Would you like a cup of coffee?

11:26.644 --> 11:28.510
Read my mind.

11:37.739 --> 11:39.731
- Herman.
- Mr. Reddington.

11:39.908 --> 11:41.615
I was surprised to get your call.

11:41.826 --> 11:44.739
I was under the impression
that our private-banking minimums...

11:44.913 --> 11:48.077
- ...were, at present, beyond your reach.
- Oh, my God.

11:48.374 --> 11:51.663
I've missed your tightly wound
officiousness...

11:51.836 --> 11:54.499
...all clenched and pink and puckered.

11:54.672 --> 11:57.039
Perhaps this will loosen your stool.

11:57.759 --> 12:03.221
It's true, I had a setback, but I'm flush now,
and my assets are seeking shelter...

12:03.389 --> 12:05.051
- ...from the storm.
- Nine figures?

12:05.225 --> 12:07.342
Mid-nines.
I haven't read the fine print...

12:07.518 --> 12:10.135
...but I do believe
that meets your minimums.

12:10.313 --> 12:12.396
It'll be a pleasure doing business.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.816
Throttle back.
You're the fourth bank I've met today.

12:15.985 --> 12:18.602
I'll tell you the same thing I told them.

12:18.780 --> 12:21.193
- What's this?
- Account numbers.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.904
I need the names behind the numbers.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.861
These are not our accounts.

12:27.038 --> 12:29.872
- I couldn't possibly...
- This is an opportunity.

12:30.166 --> 12:33.284
The U.S. government
is about to freeze those funds.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.703
If I can ID the account holders...

12:35.880 --> 12:39.123
...and notify them before
the freeze goes into effect...

12:39.300 --> 12:43.419
...I'll be owed a favor by individuals
who will be in desperate need...

12:43.596 --> 12:46.964
...of safe haven for the very funds
I'll have secured for them.

12:47.141 --> 12:50.384
If you can help me identify
those account holders...

12:50.561 --> 12:52.803
...I'd be happy to refer them to you.

12:52.981 --> 12:58.648
You must have some means of
identifying such promising new clientele.

12:59.070 --> 13:02.404
- He stabbed my husband.
- The man with the Damascus knife.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.360
Navarro worked for him.

13:04.993 --> 13:06.575
These three...

13:07.453 --> 13:10.241
...work for Navarro.
Part of the Nash syndicate.

13:10.415 --> 13:13.249
Used to run drugs outside
of Kaufman Food and Liquor.

13:13.418 --> 13:15.501
And Damascus? Who is he?

13:15.795 --> 13:18.708
I have no idea.
Look, we questioned Navarro.

13:18.881 --> 13:21.669
Nothing stuck,
so we had to kick him loose.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.335
Why were these men here?

13:25.722 --> 13:28.931
- I don't know.
- No idea what their connection was?

13:29.100 --> 13:31.433
There was no connection.
He was helping a friend.

13:31.602 --> 13:34.140
Nik Korpal. Who was also killed.

13:34.314 --> 13:37.273
- Know why he was helping Dr. Korpal?
- No.

13:38.318 --> 13:42.437
Bullets pulled from these bodies didn't
match the weapons found at the scene.

13:42.613 --> 13:44.696
Someone killed your attackers.

13:44.866 --> 13:46.357
Any idea who?

13:46.701 --> 13:49.114
I was unconscious at that point.

13:57.628 --> 14:00.541
- How did you get to the hospital?
- What?

14:00.715 --> 14:02.627
Who took you there?

14:03.301 --> 14:04.542
I don't know.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.008
I know you already know this...

14:12.185 --> 14:14.848
...so consider this a friendly reminder.

14:15.229 --> 14:18.017
You're an accessory if you help
someone get away with crime.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.057
That's a friendly reminder?

14:21.694 --> 14:24.107
In case you misplaced the last one.

14:26.115 --> 14:29.108
If you think of anything, give me a call.

14:48.679 --> 14:52.389
- And who might you be?
- I'm not helping you. You can't make me.

14:52.558 --> 14:56.017
Monetary authority caught Miss Isaacson
trying to hack into our accounts.

14:56.187 --> 14:58.270
A judge reduced her sentence
in exchange...

14:58.439 --> 15:01.773
...for her agreeing to help identify
vulnerabilities in our own system.

15:01.943 --> 15:05.687
A fox in the hen house. You'll have to
keep a close watch on the chickens.

15:05.863 --> 15:07.775
If anyone can put names
to the numbers...

15:07.949 --> 15:09.906
- ...it's Miss Isaacson.
- I'm not going to.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.068
- Name your price.
- I don't want your money.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.827
What do you want?

15:13.996 --> 15:15.282
Bite me.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.452
A woman after my own heart.

15:17.625 --> 15:21.414
You're an anarchist. You know
Charlie Chaplin was an anarchist?

15:21.921 --> 15:25.585
I've cultivated a healthy hatred
for governments and rules...

15:25.758 --> 15:30.219
...and all the incumbent fetters.
I understand. Oh, well, Herman.

15:30.388 --> 15:32.675
We tried. Perhaps next time.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.141
Wait a minute, what about Sogi-san?

15:36.310 --> 15:38.393
- The tattoo artist?
- I helped him secure...

15:38.563 --> 15:42.432
- ...a very rare dye several years ago.
- I'm sorry, a tattoo artist?

15:42.608 --> 15:45.021
A reclusive but visionary artist.

15:45.194 --> 15:48.608
Which is all the more impressive
considering he does his best work...

15:48.781 --> 15:50.989
...after drinking himself half blind.

15:51.159 --> 15:53.867
Otaru, Hokkaido prefecture.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.284
You get me those names,
I'll get you an appointment.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.790
If I'm lying,
you can always hack into the bank...

15:59.959 --> 16:02.201
...and steal the whole <i>omakase.</i>

16:02.378 --> 16:04.711
I'm sure Sogi-san will do wonders
for that...

16:04.881 --> 16:08.295
...whisper of unmarked flesh
below your suprasternal notch.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.676
Get me the appointment.
I'll get you the names.

16:10.845 --> 16:13.087
Perhaps Tweety Bird
or Yosemite Sam.

16:13.264 --> 16:16.428
Or a lady riding a monkey wrench.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.263
<i>Reddington identified
the names on the list.</i>

16:19.437 --> 16:21.929
We believe the buyer is
Rosmin Hamzah.

16:22.106 --> 16:24.849
- Bornean national with ties in Asia.
- Why him?

16:25.026 --> 16:27.609
Based on the names Red provided,
we put out an alert.

16:27.778 --> 16:31.488
TSA flagged Hamzah 12 hours ago
at Dulles under an assumed name.

16:31.657 --> 16:34.115
Agents have tracked him
to a hotel in Dupont Circle.

16:34.285 --> 16:37.824
Have Ressler stay with Bishop.
Take a team and follow Hamzah.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.910
If Reddington's right,
we'll walk away with the Informant...

16:41.083 --> 16:43.291
...and a major sponsor of terrorism.

16:59.727 --> 17:02.060
- I'm looking for Navarro.
- Who?

17:02.230 --> 17:03.391
Never heard of him.

17:03.773 --> 17:06.435
- Don't walk away from me.
- What you say to me?

17:06.608 --> 17:09.317
This corner is run
by the Nash syndicate.

17:09.487 --> 17:12.150
Navarro's your boss.
I need to speak with him.

17:12.323 --> 17:13.530
You in the wrong place.

17:13.699 --> 17:16.191
I told you not to walk away
from me while I'm asking...

17:16.368 --> 17:20.363
You're in the wrong place.
Now start to drive off or we'll have a...

17:23.459 --> 17:25.621
You want me to drive?

17:26.837 --> 17:27.998
Okay.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.748
- Stop.
- You look athletic in that tracksuit.

17:31.926 --> 17:33.633
But I got a full tank of gas, so...

17:33.803 --> 17:35.465
- Stop.
- I'm gonna ask one more time.

17:35.638 --> 17:37.971
- Navarro?
- Stop, stop. Please.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.802
There's these two guys...

17:40.977 --> 17:44.345
Shelly and Madigan.
They ran the block before I took over.

17:44.522 --> 17:46.605
- Navarro?
- I don't know who that is.

17:46.774 --> 17:47.890
Please, stop.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.650
Crisanto. He'll know
who you're looking for.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.612
Keep talking.

17:53.781 --> 17:56.194
Crisanto.
He does the pick-ups for the money.

17:56.367 --> 17:59.405
- I call him for re-up, he comes.
- Give him a call.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.787
Unless you wanna take another drive.

18:22.852 --> 18:27.267
Panic, you'll run out of air. You'll pass out.
Pass out, you can't answer my questions.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.808
If you don't answer my questions,
I'll kill you. Got it?

18:30.985 --> 18:33.068
Navarro, where is he?

18:33.362 --> 18:38.733
I've never met him. But I know a guy,
Pee-Wee, runs things for Navarro.

18:39.076 --> 18:41.238
He'll know. Pee-Wee will know.

18:42.913 --> 18:44.154
And where is Pee-Wee?

18:44.874 --> 18:47.207
<i>Hamzah's driver dropped him off
at Union Station.</i>

18:47.376 --> 18:50.460
Bishop's heading south on 6th.
Let's assume we're headed your way.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.041
<i>I'll notify M.P.D. C.</i>

18:52.214 --> 18:55.423
If Bishop's the Informant,
his alibi with the judge was a lie...

18:55.593 --> 18:59.462
- ...which means she's in on it too.
- One bad guy at a time, okay?

19:09.148 --> 19:11.390
- I'm busy.
- Mr. Sturgeon.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.559
The man you're tailing is a client.

19:13.736 --> 19:15.227
<i>Oh, am I tailing someone?</i>

19:15.571 --> 19:16.937
Tell your team to back off.

19:17.114 --> 19:20.278
- I thought I was just out picking up lunch.
<i>- Bishop's the Informant.</i>

19:20.451 --> 19:23.319
He stole the list. You nudged in
and then I gave him an alibi.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.992
- The hit-and-run.
<i>- So much for lunch.</i>

19:26.165 --> 19:27.531
The hit-and-run was a murder.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.792
Judge swore it was an accident
because she does what you tell her.

19:30.961 --> 19:32.122
<i>Yup, just like you.</i>

19:32.296 --> 19:34.379
When I told her to say
Bishop was with her...

19:34.548 --> 19:38.167
...when she saw it, that's what she did.
How's that for power?

19:38.344 --> 19:41.052
I got a judge to admit
to an affair she wasn't having.

19:41.222 --> 19:43.339
Nothing I can do,
we got teams on the buyer.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.758
<i>Then improvise.
Tell your team to stand down...</i>

19:45.935 --> 19:49.303
...or I'll leak the dirt I have on you,
and you'll be put away for life.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.349
I need a 20 on Bishop.

19:58.322 --> 20:02.362
- Bishop's turning away from the station.
- What do you mean? His buyer is here.

20:02.618 --> 20:05.486
<i>He's made you. If you don't reposition,
we risk losing him.</i>

20:05.663 --> 20:08.497
I need you to divert all units
to the west parking lot.

20:08.666 --> 20:10.783
Suspect is moving south, southwest.

20:10.960 --> 20:14.670
Reposition. Target's on the move.
Cover all southern entrances.

20:23.180 --> 20:26.264
<i>Ressler, where are you?
You have eyes on the target?</i>

20:28.978 --> 20:30.810
<i>Ressler, do you copy?</i>

20:47.621 --> 20:51.581
Howard Bishop.
FBI, you're under arrest. Hands in the air.

20:52.042 --> 20:55.001
Navabi, I got Bishop in custody.
Hamzah's heading your way now.

20:55.171 --> 20:57.629
You've just made a horrible mistake.

21:13.230 --> 21:15.768
You're not my first client
to grow a conscience.

21:16.025 --> 21:17.436
Go on, open it.

21:18.235 --> 21:19.316
I paid my debt.

21:19.487 --> 21:22.104
- I'm done.
- You disobeyed me.

21:25.242 --> 21:28.235
I said I'm through.

21:28.412 --> 21:29.823
What are you gonna do?

21:29.997 --> 21:31.078
Arrest me?

21:31.457 --> 21:34.040
On what charge? Murder?

21:34.210 --> 21:37.499
Of who? Cover up? Of what?

21:37.838 --> 21:39.921
You have no evidence against me.

21:40.216 --> 21:42.048
You don't even know my name.

21:44.929 --> 21:47.296
But I know everything about you.

21:47.473 --> 21:50.762
Starting with you pretending
to be Frank Sturgeon.

21:50.935 --> 21:52.051
Hiring me...

21:52.645 --> 21:55.683
...to dispose of the
national security advisor.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.978
You're a crooked cop, Agent Ressler.

21:59.151 --> 22:01.734
Know what they do
to crooked cops in prison?

22:01.904 --> 22:03.611
One with such a pretty face.

22:05.574 --> 22:06.906
You're right.

22:07.076 --> 22:10.114
I can't arrest you, but I can kill you.

22:10.287 --> 22:16.579
Which is what I'm gonna do if you ever,
ever get in touch with me again.

22:17.711 --> 22:18.952
Oh, I'll be in touch.

22:21.423 --> 22:23.415
It's your funeral.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.306
Do you remember Henry Prescott?

22:40.484 --> 22:41.520
Prescott?

22:41.694 --> 22:43.856
Guy responsible for
covering up Reven's murder.

22:44.029 --> 22:46.521
I know who he is.
Why are you asking?

22:46.699 --> 22:48.281
Bishop is his client.

22:48.450 --> 22:50.191
- Who told you that?
- Bishop.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.782
I've been interrogating him
for the last hour.

22:52.955 --> 22:55.242
- You okay?
- Took forever to process Hamzah.

22:55.416 --> 22:58.784
What happened? One minute
you're pulling Navabi off of Hamzah.

22:58.961 --> 23:00.793
Next, you're on top
of him and Bishop.

23:00.963 --> 23:03.330
Well, I thought he made us.
I was wrong.

23:03.507 --> 23:05.464
Hardly. Because of your arrest...

23:05.634 --> 23:08.877
...Bishop and Hamzah are in custody.
The sanctions list was recovered.

23:09.054 --> 23:12.764
- Assets have been frozen.
- Bishop wasn't across town...

23:12.933 --> 23:16.426
...when it was stolen. Judge said
they were together. Prescott told her to.

23:16.604 --> 23:18.812
- Why would she do that?
- Bishop doesn't know...

23:18.981 --> 23:20.643
...but the hit-and-run was planned.

23:20.816 --> 23:23.559
Prescott planted the judge there
in advance as a witness.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.773
- So it wasn't an accident.
- It was murder.

23:26.155 --> 23:30.240
The victim was Jasmine Perez.
An M.P.D.C. Internal Affairs investigator.

23:30.409 --> 23:34.494
I got nothing from Bishop
in terms of a motive or a suspect...

23:34.663 --> 23:37.280
...but the good IA officer's
worst enemy is a bad cop.

23:37.458 --> 23:39.575
Ressler, Navabi, talk to IA.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.709
Find the lead investigator.

23:41.921 --> 23:46.586
We've arrested a terrorist and traitor. If a
crooked cop is in the story, I want him too.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.342
Pee-Wee.

23:53.849 --> 23:55.886
- Who's asking?
- Crisanto told me...

23:56.060 --> 23:58.427
...you could bring me to Navarro.

23:58.687 --> 24:00.223
I just work the grill.

24:01.148 --> 24:03.356
And launder money for Navarro.

24:11.033 --> 24:12.490
Where does he keep the money?

24:21.377 --> 24:22.367
Who the hell are you?

24:22.544 --> 24:24.786
I'm the woman
you're taking to Navarro.

24:24.964 --> 24:27.126
You can bring him a stranger...

24:27.299 --> 24:33.341
...or you can bring him a stranger
who you let burn all his money.

24:34.098 --> 24:36.010
What's it gonna be?

24:39.228 --> 24:42.312
Detective Farwell, we appreciate
you taking time to speak with us.

24:42.481 --> 24:45.315
- About time the feds got involved.
- What makes you say that?

24:45.484 --> 24:49.353
The past month, Detective Perez
had a few investigations go south on her.

24:49.530 --> 24:52.443
Evidence went missing,
cops walked back testimony.

24:52.616 --> 24:54.073
She thought there was dirt.

24:54.243 --> 24:56.781
- What do you think?
- I think she was onto a dirty cop.

24:56.954 --> 24:58.536
And killed her to keep her quiet.

24:58.706 --> 25:00.663
We went through her files.
No mention...

25:00.874 --> 25:02.957
...of missing evidence
or recanted testimony.

25:03.127 --> 25:04.743
Not on departmental files.

25:04.920 --> 25:08.379
Prying eyes. Offline, she kept
a more detailed accounting.

25:08.549 --> 25:10.541
- Did you see those files?
- Yes.

25:10.718 --> 25:13.961
I told the investigating officers
about them. They showed no interest.

25:14.138 --> 25:17.927
Which is why I'm relieved to see you
guys. Someone's gotta police the police.

25:18.100 --> 25:20.342
We'd appreciate
letting us into her apartment...

25:20.519 --> 25:24.229
- ...so we can access her server.
- I'll do better. I'll tell you her password.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.773
She shared it with me,
so I could keep up to date.

25:27.192 --> 25:28.399
It's Frank Sturgeon.

25:28.569 --> 25:30.811
- Who's Frank Sturgeon?
- She never said.

25:30.988 --> 25:33.321
Maybe the one who got away.

25:35.367 --> 25:39.281
There's no record of a Frank Sturgeon
on file. Think it's an alias?

25:42.458 --> 25:44.165
Ressler?

25:47.796 --> 25:51.164
FBI. We're here to search
Detective Perez's apartment.

26:04.646 --> 26:06.057
Ressler.

26:06.523 --> 26:08.435
- You check the bedroom?
- What's going on?

26:08.609 --> 26:11.226
- You didn't say a word.
- We're looking for a cop killer.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.690
- Is that it?
- What else would it be?

26:13.864 --> 26:16.322
I don't know.
That's why I'm asking you.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.238
Can you check the bedroom, please?

26:40.557 --> 26:43.049
<i>Look, this is Detective Perez
with Internal Affairs.</i>

26:43.227 --> 26:45.219
<i>- Whoever this is...
- I can't arrest you...</i>

26:45.395 --> 26:46.727
<i>...but I can kill you.</i>

26:46.897 --> 26:49.605
<i>Which is what I'm gonna do
if you ever...</i>

26:49.900 --> 26:52.438
...ever get in touch with me again.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.281
- Yeah?
<i>- Hello, Donald.</i>

27:02.579 --> 27:05.447
I think it's time for us
to have a little chat.

27:11.255 --> 27:13.372
I understand we're nowhere
on the hit-and-run.

27:13.549 --> 27:14.881
Not yet.

27:15.050 --> 27:17.383
- Can we talk about Ressler?
- Of course.

27:20.389 --> 27:24.008
The way he acted at Union Station...

27:24.184 --> 27:27.177
...his behavior at
Detective Perez's apartment...

27:27.354 --> 27:29.471
...I can't put my finger on it,
but he seems...

27:29.648 --> 27:31.014
Unsteady.

27:31.191 --> 27:34.150
- You've noticed?
- I have. He seems preoccupied.

27:34.570 --> 27:36.402
- He won't talk.
- I'll speak with him.

27:36.572 --> 27:39.280
- Ask him to come up.
- He's not here.

27:39.741 --> 27:42.028
- Where is he?
- He got a phone call and ran out...

27:42.202 --> 27:44.945
...of Detective Perez's apartment.
I have no idea why.

27:46.290 --> 27:48.202
Take Agent Mojtabai, find the judge.

27:48.375 --> 27:51.493
I wanna know why she lied
and who she's covering for.

27:54.047 --> 27:55.458
I'm worried about him.

27:57.926 --> 27:59.633
So am I.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.049
How did you know about Prescott?

28:02.222 --> 28:04.259
I make it my business to know.

28:04.433 --> 28:06.516
Make it your business
to know his real name?

28:06.685 --> 28:08.677
Because that would
come in handy right now.

28:08.854 --> 28:10.436
Why, so you can kill him?

28:10.939 --> 28:13.556
How does the Informant fit into this?

28:13.901 --> 28:16.564
The Informant is a client of Prescott's.

28:16.737 --> 28:19.525
You're Prescott's fixer,
I put you on to the Informant...

28:19.698 --> 28:22.031
...so Prescott would ask to get off.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.238
- Why would you do that?
- As a test.

28:24.411 --> 28:27.074
See how far down
the rabbit hole you'd fallen.

28:27.247 --> 28:28.783
Good news is, you passed.

28:28.957 --> 28:31.540
Prescott asked you
to look the other way, you didn't.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.918
Because of that
he's gonna destroy me.

28:34.087 --> 28:35.703
Thanks for nothing.

28:35.964 --> 28:39.708
I thought we'd pay Bishop's
make-believe girlfriend a visit.

28:40.093 --> 28:41.209
The judge?

28:41.386 --> 28:43.628
She knows I'm an agent.
We can't go in together.

28:43.805 --> 28:46.388
As long as you play dirty cop
we'll be fine.

28:46.558 --> 28:51.098
Under the circumstances,
I think you can manage that, can't you?

28:53.815 --> 28:55.647
- Who is it?
- Agent Donald Ressler.

28:55.817 --> 28:58.525
I have a few follow-up questions.

29:01.406 --> 29:03.022
I have nothing else to say to you.

29:03.200 --> 29:05.442
Judge Fisher,
I'm Raymond Reddington.

29:05.619 --> 29:07.906
Let me begin by saying
I'm a great fan.

29:08.080 --> 29:11.073
You incarcerated three of my
fiercest competitors.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.367
It may come as a surprise,
but I appreciate...

29:13.543 --> 29:15.956
...a good law-and-order judge.

29:16.713 --> 29:19.080
What is this all about, Agent Ressler?

29:19.258 --> 29:22.126
Well, Reddington and I,
we have an arrangement.

29:22.302 --> 29:23.634
Like you and Prescott.

29:24.471 --> 29:27.088
- Don't know anything about...
- I know a man...

29:27.266 --> 29:30.976
...who gets people to talk
in the most ingenious ways.

29:31.144 --> 29:34.558
Utilizing the most unlikely tools
for his trade.

29:34.731 --> 29:38.816
Animals, insects, a well-placed cork.

29:38.986 --> 29:41.478
Unfortunately,
times being what they are...

29:41.655 --> 29:44.614
...my associate has taken a job
working on an ostrich farm...

29:44.783 --> 29:46.615
...outside of Texarkana.

29:46.785 --> 29:50.244
But to get the truth out of a judge,
I'm sure he'd come out of retirement.

29:50.414 --> 29:53.122
We know Perez was murdered
to cover up police corruption.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.875
And that Prescott got you to lie
about what you saw...

29:56.044 --> 29:58.286
- ...in order to protect her killer.
- Ridiculous.

29:58.463 --> 30:00.045
FBI's on its way to arrest you...

30:00.215 --> 30:02.628
...as an accessory after the fact
of a cop murder.

30:02.801 --> 30:06.090
- I told the truth.
- Bishop's already in custody.

30:06.263 --> 30:09.347
See, he confessed.
Cut a deal to testify against you.

30:09.516 --> 30:12.008
Speaking of deals, here's mine:

30:12.185 --> 30:14.051
I need to talk to Prescott.

30:14.229 --> 30:19.520
And given my relationship with Donald,
he's no longer taking my calls.

30:19.693 --> 30:23.027
Tell me how to find him,
and I'll arrange safe passage...

30:23.196 --> 30:26.610
...for you out of the country
to the city of your choosing.

30:26.783 --> 30:28.695
Might I suggest Montevideo?

30:28.869 --> 30:32.783
No better way to forget one's troubles
than a night at the opera...

30:32.956 --> 30:34.618
...at the Teatro Solis.

30:36.251 --> 30:37.617
Were you honest once?

30:38.253 --> 30:40.290
I'm almost always honest.

30:40.464 --> 30:42.376
Decent, then? Moral?

30:43.842 --> 30:47.711
I was all of those things, once.

30:48.180 --> 30:53.221
Then my 17-year-old son
assaulted a woman...

30:53.810 --> 30:55.893
...and suddenly I wasn't.

30:56.104 --> 30:58.517
A parent from his class...

30:58.690 --> 31:01.103
He was an attorney.
...called to say my son...

31:01.276 --> 31:05.611
...was in custody and the young woman
was on the way to the hospital...

31:05.781 --> 31:10.492
...to have a rape kit administered,
and...

31:10.994 --> 31:13.577
...did I want the whole thing
to disappear?

31:13.872 --> 31:15.738
The attorney said that?

31:16.750 --> 31:20.209
The next day, the rape kit vanished.

31:20.379 --> 31:23.918
I didn't ask him to do it,
but I didn't make him put it back.

31:24.091 --> 31:27.584
Without it,
the charges were withdrawn.

31:27.761 --> 31:30.595
- And you were in his debt.
- Six months later...

31:30.764 --> 31:33.051
...he made his first request.

31:33.558 --> 31:35.390
The attorney did?

31:35.811 --> 31:37.018
What's his name?

31:38.230 --> 31:40.267
Mitchell Hatley.

31:40.649 --> 31:44.609
I suppressed evidence.
I let the guilty walk free.

31:45.153 --> 31:46.985
How can I forgive myself?

31:47.781 --> 31:49.272
I don't know.

31:52.285 --> 31:54.026
I'm gonna get my coat.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.914
Forgiveness doesn't mean
accepting what you've done, Donald.

32:03.088 --> 32:06.707
It means understanding that the line
dividing good and evil...

32:06.883 --> 32:09.375
...cuts through the hearts of all of us.

32:21.440 --> 32:22.931
Don't touch her.

32:24.317 --> 32:26.559
- FBI. Please step back.
- Please stand back.

32:26.736 --> 32:28.352
- Move away.
- Out of nowhere.

32:28.530 --> 32:30.613
- Across the street.
- Yeah.

32:30.824 --> 32:34.443
Can I get you to stand back here?
Please, sir. I need to get your information.

32:37.873 --> 32:38.863
Down here.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.872
- This way. Hurry.
- Watch out.

32:42.294 --> 32:45.787
I never thanked you
for what you did after Audrey died.

32:47.215 --> 32:50.174
- You were preoccupied.
- I was crazed.

32:50.343 --> 32:53.836
Convinced I should kill
the man who shot her.

32:54.264 --> 32:56.722
You remember
what you told me to do?

32:57.267 --> 32:59.475
I told you to go home.

32:59.644 --> 33:00.680
You didn't.

33:00.854 --> 33:04.438
You said that once you cross over,
there are things in the darkness...

33:04.608 --> 33:07.476
...that can keep your heart
from ever feeling the light again.

33:07.652 --> 33:10.315
I didn't go home,
but I never crossed over.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.481
I never thanked you for that.

33:12.949 --> 33:16.033
Nor should you.
Your circumspection afforded me...

33:16.203 --> 33:20.664
...the opportunity to take care
of Audrey's killer myself. It was a win-win.

33:21.082 --> 33:24.371
I didn't want Prescott's real name
so I could kill him.

33:24.961 --> 33:27.544
I wanted it so I could arrest him.

33:28.048 --> 33:31.041
- He goes to prison, so will you.
- I know.

33:31.218 --> 33:33.835
But I'm in the darkness
and doing the right thing...

33:34.012 --> 33:37.050
...is the only way
I'll ever feel the light again.

33:46.316 --> 33:47.807
Nice. Go.

33:49.945 --> 33:50.981
Get him. Get him.

33:58.828 --> 33:59.909
Hey there.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.746
Looks like a fun time.

34:02.916 --> 34:04.657
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Can we help you?

34:04.834 --> 34:07.076
You're good. This will take a minute.

34:07.254 --> 34:09.041
- What's going on?
- What you doing here?

34:09.214 --> 34:11.251
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- You know this man?

34:11.424 --> 34:13.666
- You must be the wife. Janet, well...
- Janet.

34:13.842 --> 34:18.429
...I'm sorry, Janet, but your husband's
been lying to you for a very long time.

34:19.349 --> 34:21.511
Whatever this is, whoever you are,
we're just...

34:21.685 --> 34:23.893
Special Agent Donald Ressler, FBI.

34:24.353 --> 34:26.687
Mitchell Hatley,
I'm gonna place you under arrest.

34:26.856 --> 34:31.897
- Arrest for what? This is insane.
- That is a terrible, terrible idea.

34:32.487 --> 34:34.274
Oh, I know it is.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.045
Get back inside.

35:05.478 --> 35:07.014
Go ahead, Agent Ressler.

35:07.188 --> 35:08.804
Pull the trigger.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.357
If you don't, we both go to jail.

35:17.741 --> 35:19.323
Come on, do it.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.117
Donald.

35:55.445 --> 35:58.279
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Open up.

36:02.869 --> 36:04.076
Remember me?

36:04.329 --> 36:07.037
Pee-Wee sends his regards.

36:10.085 --> 36:11.701
Put them on.

36:26.476 --> 36:29.184
- You got a minute?
- Agent Ressler, please, sit.

36:29.354 --> 36:30.936
I need to talk to you.

36:31.356 --> 36:32.472
It'll have to wait.

36:32.732 --> 36:35.099
- I'm afraid it can't.
- There's been an incident.

36:35.276 --> 36:36.983
Got a call from Bureau of Prisons.

36:37.320 --> 36:40.939
There was an accident
involving the transport vehicle...

36:41.116 --> 36:42.448
...moving Prescott.

36:42.784 --> 36:46.368
The transport was struck
by an unknown assailant.

36:46.538 --> 36:48.655
<i>We assume one of Prescott's
many friends...</i>

36:48.832 --> 36:51.996
<i>...who felt he'd been compromised
didn't wanna see him in court.</i>

36:52.627 --> 36:55.461
<i>The drivers, they somehow
managed to escape. But Prescott...</i>

36:57.507 --> 36:59.089
Prescott wasn't so lucky.

36:59.926 --> 37:03.761
My good friend Donald Ressler
sends his regards.

37:16.359 --> 37:18.942
Much as it pains me that
Prescott won't be in court...

37:19.112 --> 37:23.607
<i>...the records we've recovered will
help us prosecute dozens of his clients.</i>

37:28.455 --> 37:29.445
What's this?

37:30.707 --> 37:32.664
Signed confession.

37:36.171 --> 37:37.412
I don't accept.

37:38.465 --> 37:41.549
- Why not?
- When Prescott's files came in...

37:41.718 --> 37:45.007
...I thought your name
would be inside. It wasn't.

37:45.388 --> 37:46.549
Well, it should've been.

37:46.723 --> 37:51.138
What happened with Prescott, the
missing file, Red did that to protect me.

37:51.311 --> 37:53.394
It's not right. I...

37:53.646 --> 37:56.935
I'm not okay with it.
I think that you deserve the truth.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.225
I know what's inside this letter.

37:59.736 --> 38:01.773
Maybe not all the details,
but I can guess.

38:02.155 --> 38:04.943
Like I can guess
how sick you're feeling inside.

38:05.116 --> 38:07.483
I'm not interested
in your feelings, Agent Ressler.

38:07.660 --> 38:09.492
I'm not interested in what you want.

38:09.871 --> 38:14.491
None of us are the people we were
before this task force started.

38:15.001 --> 38:16.492
Before Reddington.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.755
So I'm going to hold on to this letter...

38:21.925 --> 38:25.965
...with the expectation that I'll find you
at your desk first thing tomorrow morning.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.753
Every morning after that...

38:27.931 --> 38:32.016
...ready to do your job
until the work of this task force is finished.

38:35.647 --> 38:37.013
Then and only then...

38:37.524 --> 38:40.938
...will I send this letter
through the proper channels.

38:47.450 --> 38:49.737
And I expect you
to do the same for me.

38:57.085 --> 38:59.122
I hope you don't take this
the wrong way...

38:59.295 --> 39:01.503
...but we've been seeing
a lot of each other.

39:01.673 --> 39:04.507
I made it perfectly clear
I wanted Prescott to go to jail.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.963
- You had him killed.
- I did.

39:07.929 --> 39:09.261
I never asked for your help.

39:09.430 --> 39:11.888
With all due respect,
I didn't kill Henry Prescott...

39:12.058 --> 39:14.641
...to protect you.
I killed him to protect myself.

39:14.811 --> 39:17.724
The man knew the nature
of my relationship with the FBI.

39:17.897 --> 39:20.765
I couldn't risk that info coming to light...

39:20.942 --> 39:23.355
- ...in a public trial.
- And my file?

39:23.528 --> 39:27.488
You removed it from Prescott's records
before they were taken into custody?

39:28.324 --> 39:32.193
Well, I won't trade being under
his thumb for being under yours.

39:32.829 --> 39:37.665
Sins should be buried like the dead.
Not that they may be forgotten...

39:37.834 --> 39:41.999
...but that we may remember them
and find our way forward nonetheless.

39:42.589 --> 39:45.206
I hope this will help you do just that.

39:45.383 --> 39:48.376
Besides, after today,
I'd have no reason to think...

39:48.553 --> 39:52.923
...you'd respond to threats,
and blackmail is such a nasty business.

39:53.099 --> 39:55.637
Particularly among friends,
don't you think?

40:09.908 --> 40:14.448
There was a man at my house
the night you killed my husband.

40:14.704 --> 40:16.616
He had a Damascus knife.

40:16.789 --> 40:18.621
Who was he?

40:19.250 --> 40:20.991
I can't remember.

40:25.465 --> 40:28.003
What about him?

40:28.509 --> 40:31.752
His name was Nik Korpal.
My husband was helping him.

40:31.930 --> 40:35.344
Helping him with something
that got them both killed.

40:36.309 --> 40:38.141
Then him.

40:38.686 --> 40:40.143
Then her.

40:41.356 --> 40:43.063
You don't get it.

40:43.232 --> 40:44.348
That guy, Nik...

40:44.859 --> 40:48.148
- What about him?
- Your man wasn't helping Nik.

40:48.446 --> 40:50.529
Nik was helping your man.

40:52.617 --> 40:54.529
Nik was helping Tom?

40:57.997 --> 40:59.408
With what?

40:59.582 --> 41:01.164
I can't.

41:02.043 --> 41:04.456
If they ever found out, I...

42:13.990 --> 42:15.572
Okay.

42:16.909 --> 42:18.616
This is okay.
