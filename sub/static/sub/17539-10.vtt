00:17.392 --> 00:20.062
I can't believe I let
you talk me into doing this.

00:20.062 --> 00:23.524
What happened to
"Sure, best friend.
Anything for you"?

00:23.524 --> 00:25.943
That was before I knew
it would involve pom poms.

00:25.943 --> 00:27.569
Forget about
the pom poms and focus

00:27.569 --> 00:30.072
on the super awesome
outfit we made.

00:30.072 --> 00:32.032
It is pretty wicked,
isn't it?

00:32.032 --> 00:34.243
I think that
all cheerleading outfits
should have spikes.

00:34.243 --> 00:35.118
(clinks)

00:35.118 --> 00:36.203
Wow! You look great!

00:36.203 --> 00:37.371
I'm so glad
you're doing this.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.413
You know me.

00:38.413 --> 00:40.415
Anything to show
my school spirit.

00:40.415 --> 00:42.876
‐Does Spirit Day involve
hitting people?
‐No.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.169
‐Stealing?
‐Ben: No.

00:44.169 --> 00:46.880
But feel free
to put those ideas
in the suggestion box.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.465
Will do!
(snickers)

00:48.465 --> 00:50.717
‐You have a suggestion box?
‐Nope.

00:50.717 --> 00:53.095
You lied to keep him
from bugging you?

00:53.095 --> 00:55.264
‐Well, I‐‐
‐I have never been
more into you.

00:55.264 --> 00:56.348
(chuckles)
Okay.

00:56.348 --> 00:57.391
I'll see you out there.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.142
So you guys
know the cheer...

00:59.142 --> 01:00.769
You just gave
it to us.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.229
Everyone knows the cheer.

01:02.229 --> 01:03.272
We do it every year!

01:04.273 --> 01:06.358
F‐I‐G‐H‐T!

01:06.358 --> 01:08.277
What's that spell?
Fight, fight, fight!

01:08.277 --> 01:09.570
‐(continues cheering)
‐Is it just me, or...

01:09.570 --> 01:11.863
Does this cheer sound
exactly like that spell

01:11.863 --> 01:13.574
that my mom used to say
to us when we were kids?

01:13.574 --> 01:14.616
How did that go?

01:14.616 --> 01:16.743
B‐I‐T and E!

01:16.743 --> 01:18.829
‐What does that spell?
‐Bite, bite, bite!

01:18.829 --> 01:20.789
(both cheering)
Speak no words!
We'll cause a fright!

01:20.789 --> 01:22.708
What's a bark
without a bite?

01:22.708 --> 01:25.085

01:25.085 --> 01:26.503

01:26.503 --> 01:28.797
‐(barks)
‐You accidentally turned

01:28.797 --> 01:30.591
everyone into dogs
and you want me

01:30.591 --> 01:32.593
to help you use
your spellbook to reverse it?

01:32.593 --> 01:34.136
(barks)

01:34.136 --> 01:36.763
Of course I speak dog!
I'm Cruella's son.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.223
But why don't you just
spell them back?

01:38.223 --> 01:39.933
(growls)

01:39.933 --> 01:41.476
Right.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.270
‐You can't because
all you can do is bark.
‐(Jay barks)

01:43.270 --> 01:45.647
(chuckles)
Sorry, Mal,

01:45.647 --> 01:48.150
‐but opportunities like this
don't happen every day.
‐(Jay pants)

01:48.150 --> 01:49.318

02:01.788 --> 02:03.206
‐Heel.
‐(growls)

02:03.206 --> 02:05.459
Fine.
Give me the spellbook.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.918
(barks)

02:06.918 --> 02:08.754
Page 43.
Got it.

02:08.754 --> 02:11.089
Here it is.
"Bark, woof, bark,

02:11.089 --> 02:13.216
"bow wow, bark, grrr."

02:13.216 --> 02:15.260
(barks, woofs, barks)

02:15.260 --> 02:17.471
(bow wows, barks, growls)

02:17.471 --> 02:19.139
Hey!

02:19.139 --> 02:20.807
Hi, guys...

02:20.807 --> 02:23.226
Jay, you know how I said
Spirit Day shouldn't involve

02:23.226 --> 02:24.811
‐hitting people?
‐Yeah...

02:24.811 --> 02:26.396
I changed my mind.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.023
(laughs nervously)
