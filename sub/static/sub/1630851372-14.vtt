what most people called

00:03.244 --> 00:06.351
"spring break"
was called A.E.A.

a week-long

blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:09.457 --> 00:11.390
All we cared about
was no school.

00:11.459 --> 00:13.944
Lots of my friends went on
trips with their families

00:14.014 --> 00:15.981

00:16.050 --> 00:19.019

vacation in my happy place --

00:19.157 --> 00:21.918
on the couch,
in front of the TV.

00:21.987 --> 00:24.127
I planned to eat cereal
till my teeth fell out

00:24.127 --> 00:26.440
and watch cartoons
till my eyeballs fell out.

00:26.509 --> 00:28.683
Basically, if something
didn't fall out, I failed.

to it for weeks.

Grandpa and Grandma's farm.

00:40.488 --> 00:42.559

to the country?!

00:42.628 --> 00:44.009

00:44.078 --> 00:46.494
Contrary to popular belief,
there's a difference

00:46.563 --> 00:48.082
between growing up
in "the South"

00:48.186 --> 00:49.911
and growing up in
"the Country."

00:49.980 --> 00:52.707
I did the former.
My mom and dad did the latter.

00:52.776 --> 00:54.330
This is how I grew up.

they seemed to me.

01:09.690 --> 01:12.210
My point --
we were not the same.

01:12.279 --> 01:14.004

and said he needed

01:14.143 --> 01:15.454

01:15.523 --> 01:18.112
And as you know,
family always comes first.

01:18.112 --> 01:20.942

out my whole week.

01:21.011 --> 01:23.635

of The Beverly Hillbillies.

01:25.844 --> 01:28.018

don't even have a TV.

01:28.157 --> 01:29.537
It's so boring there.

Don't you dare call
my parents "boring."

01:32.161 --> 01:33.714
It's been a minute
since we visited,

01:33.783 --> 01:35.543

to spend some time with them.

01:35.612 --> 01:38.719
Don't get me wrong -- I loved
Grandma Bessie and Big Jim,

01:38.788 --> 01:41.308
especially
when they visited us.

01:41.377 --> 01:43.310
But going to the country
was a pain.

will do you good.

01:45.484 --> 01:47.003

Oh, please don't say that
in front of my mother.

with mothers and daughters.

01:58.359 --> 02:00.913
If that little piece of cloth
is what you call "clothing,"

02:00.982 --> 02:03.019
then clearly, I need to check
everything else

02:03.123 --> 02:04.193
in your little suitcase.

02:04.262 --> 02:06.264
What? You don't trust me
to do anything.

02:06.333 --> 02:08.404
If you're referring to that trip
with your friends,

02:08.473 --> 02:09.577
then the answer's
still no.
