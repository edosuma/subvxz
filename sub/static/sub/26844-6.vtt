WEBVTT

00:05.790 --> 00:07.720
Previously on Mars.

00:08.060 --> 00:09.523
We have to perform
a caesarian immediately.

00:09.530 --> 00:10.689
No, I'm not ready.

00:10.690 --> 00:12.537
What's wrong with her?
What's wrong with my baby?

00:12.560 --> 00:14.022
You need to tell
us where the water is.

00:14.030 --> 00:15.560
You're one crazy
bitch, you know that?

00:15.630 --> 00:18.820
I came here to find life, to study
life, but not at the expense of it.

00:19.390 --> 00:21.590
Lukrum should be
stopped, but they can't be.

00:21.790 --> 00:25.920
The resolution to impose sanctions against
Lukrum Industries has not passed.

00:26.530 --> 00:28.930
I need you to sever the energy
transfer to Lukrum Colony.

00:29.200 --> 00:31.593
I got a crew that's about to suffocate
because your lunatic number two

00:31.600 --> 00:34.150
decided to cut power to my camp.

00:34.280 --> 00:37.680
That power was supplying the entire camp, and
cutting them off compromised their grid.

00:38.090 --> 00:40.890
We nearly lost their
colony, and everyone in it.

00:41.320 --> 00:42.690
Confine him to his quarters.

00:42.760 --> 00:44.330
And that's why I'm leaving.

00:44.390 --> 00:46.510
I need to be somewhere where
I can fulfill my purpose.

00:46.900 --> 00:48.860
We both know that
place is Lukrum.

00:48.930 --> 00:51.150
We have nothing to show for it.

00:51.220 --> 00:54.220
Not water, not Joon, and
now I'm losing you too.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074

01:27.450 --> 01:29.650
It's hard to be patient.

01:29.660 --> 01:31.920
It's not in our nature.

01:31.930 --> 01:34.460
The solar mirror
project is at 22% completion.

01:34.530 --> 01:36.930
And although temperatures
have risen slightly,

01:37.000 --> 01:39.260
Visual evidence of a
success hasn't been seen.

01:40.350 --> 01:43.420
No water on the surface,
not a cloud in the sky.

01:44.650 --> 01:47.819
Still, we couldn't have gotten even
this far without our partners.

01:47.820 --> 01:50.460
Though it appears they now have
a partnership of their own.

01:52.130 --> 01:54.060
As they did with Russia.

01:54.130 --> 01:56.830
Lukrum has brokered an independent
deal with the Chinese.

01:56.870 --> 01:59.150
To build them a colony on Mars.

01:59.620 --> 02:03.820
All of this has left IMSF vulnerable
to powerful business interests.

02:07.730 --> 02:10.529
But while the struggle for
control continues on Earth.

02:10.530 --> 02:14.180
No one can really control
what happens on Mars.

02:18.420 --> 02:21.290
The planet has a way of making
sure actions have consequences.

02:25.630 --> 02:28.300
Both physical.

02:29.230 --> 02:31.620
And emotional.

02:31.790 --> 02:34.850
But humans are nothing,
if not determined.

02:34.920 --> 02:40.160
And while some may question our
presence here at all, we are here.

02:42.530 --> 02:45.700
And our numbers are growing.

02:56.360 --> 02:58.490
She's using
less supplemental oxygen.

02:58.500 --> 02:59.960
Yes.

03:00.030 --> 03:02.093
Though lung development is
hard to measure with certainty,

03:02.100 --> 03:03.710
particularly in this situation.

03:03.720 --> 03:06.380
But her basic reflexes are good.

03:06.390 --> 03:08.250
And she's gained weight.

03:08.260 --> 03:11.390
We can't be sure how well she can
breathe and eat on her own just yet.

03:11.460 --> 03:15.960
I hate that she's on a ventilator,
that she has to be kept sedated.

03:17.360 --> 03:20.680
I haven't even held her.

03:23.090 --> 03:25.850
How much longer does
she need to stay like this?

03:25.920 --> 03:28.560
I appreciate this is difficult,
but given the unknowns,

03:28.630 --> 03:31.490
I think it's best if she remains
within a controlled environment

03:31.560 --> 03:33.229
for as long as possible.

03:33.230 --> 03:34.800
It's already been two months.

03:34.860 --> 03:38.580
Are you saying six
more, a year, forever?

03:38.650 --> 03:41.620
Don't you understand,
we cannot take any chances.

03:45.790 --> 03:48.590
She's still too fragile.

03:50.500 --> 03:55.280
I've tried, perhaps too hard, to prove
that I wasn't just a scientist.

03:58.820 --> 04:01.560
I let my ego get in the way.

04:01.620 --> 04:04.460
Perhaps my fear.

04:04.930 --> 04:08.100
And it's made me
complicit in what's happened.

04:12.790 --> 04:15.950
I should have seen it coming.

04:16.390 --> 04:19.290
Again, I didn't.

04:19.360 --> 04:22.160
Losing the sanction vote
has left me powerless here.

04:22.800 --> 04:26.600
Leslie, I know how
hard it is to lead as a woman,

04:27.750 --> 04:31.820
as a person of conscience,
as someone who's grieving.

04:33.090 --> 04:36.360
But Joon knew what she was doing
when she picked you to succeed her,

04:36.430 --> 04:39.860
and I have complete
faith in you.

04:40.360 --> 04:44.020
To turn this thing around, and put
us on the right side of history.

04:47.520 --> 04:50.420
What is it going to take
before we change our ways?

04:51.990 --> 04:54.940
Is it going to take
something awful, some crisis?

04:57.530 --> 05:03.920
We tend to respond to crises, but
people also take long term views.

05:05.720 --> 05:09.190
Sometimes we don't need to
be woken up by disaster.

05:09.490 --> 05:12.090
Sometimes we look
ahead to the future.

05:15.770 --> 05:17.720
1500 feet
is our target altitude.

05:17.780 --> 05:20.050
We want to be above or below
the clouds, but not in them.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.250
Okay, yeah, that sounds good.

05:22.260 --> 05:26.790
Flying along for
hours at a time over sea ice,

05:26.860 --> 05:29.830
seeing the big changes that
really are happening.

05:29.900 --> 05:32.560
That's where I get the sense
of the Earth's fragility.

05:33.070 --> 05:35.870
I think the planet is in peril, and
we are being careless in some ways.

05:36.620 --> 05:38.520
That's 10,000 in the clear.

05:38.590 --> 05:40.560
Gotcha.

05:40.890 --> 05:44.260
NASA's Operation Icebridge is the
largest aerial survey ever conducted

05:44.330 --> 05:46.790
of the Earth's polar ice.

05:46.860 --> 05:49.630
My desk is a seat in an airplane, and
my office window is the view out

05:49.700 --> 05:51.720
on the North Pole.

05:52.590 --> 05:55.583
The ultimate goal is to inform both the US
public and the world about the changing state

05:55.590 --> 05:57.890
of the planet.

05:58.120 --> 06:00.390
We are ready for the launch.

06:00.460 --> 06:05.260
We think of NASA as this organization
that sends us out to the moon and beyond,

06:07.030 --> 06:11.790
but actually most of NASA's budget is spent
on making Earth a more survivable place

06:11.850 --> 06:14.260
for human beings.

06:14.620 --> 06:17.120
NASA's not just flying
into space these days.

06:17.190 --> 06:20.360
They're flying over
the oil disaster.

06:20.430 --> 06:22.330
Above the
Earth, a dozen NASA satellites

06:22.400 --> 06:24.580
are tracking global
warming as we speak.

06:24.650 --> 06:28.590
It is absolutely critical that we
understand Earth's environment because

06:28.650 --> 06:32.260
this is the only place
that we have to live.

06:34.260 --> 06:38.960
Information is survivability, and
NASA keeps everybody alive on Earth.

06:39.330 --> 06:42.220
In ways that people
can't even imagine.

06:43.520 --> 06:46.213
The changes that we've in the seen in the
Arctic have actually outpaced the most

06:46.220 --> 06:50.829
grim of the model predictions, and it's going
to lead to a great number of changes that

06:50.830 --> 06:53.590
we as a species are
going to have to deal with.

06:55.430 --> 06:57.450
What is the worst case scenario?

06:57.520 --> 07:01.320
They're worried that we're going to have to
suffer before we improve the way we do things.

07:03.120 --> 07:08.459
I think there's no shortage of sort of
shocking events that should be acting

07:08.460 --> 07:10.860
as that wake-up call.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.030
Under a state of emergency.

07:12.100 --> 07:14.680
200,000 gallons leaking a day.

07:14.750 --> 07:15.920
Fracking.

07:15.990 --> 07:17.790
Well water full of methane gas.

07:17.850 --> 07:21.890
And it's not for lack of shocks
that change hasn't happened.

07:22.930 --> 07:27.860
Why would we imagine that in going to Mars
that narrative wouldn't repeat once again?

07:28.930 --> 07:30.263
Keep an eye on
that heat exchanger.

07:30.270 --> 07:32.270
- Is it jammed again?
- Yeah, there's no moving it.

07:32.320 --> 07:34.050
Shep, what are
you guys doing out there?

07:34.120 --> 07:37.490
Trying everything we can to get this thing
going again, but it's not looking good.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.360
We need to crank up the
RPM, we're getting nowhere.

07:40.430 --> 07:42.129
Push it to 50 if you have to.

07:42.130 --> 07:43.530
Affirmative, sir.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.393
We've gone less than a
centimeter in over an hour.

07:45.400 --> 07:47.350
Shall I increase
downforce to 70 kilograms?

07:47.420 --> 07:48.880
Did that work last time?

07:48.950 --> 07:51.350
No. That's not going to help.

07:51.420 --> 07:53.690
That bit is trapped again.

07:53.760 --> 07:55.660
Damn it!

07:57.630 --> 08:01.300
Lukrum is making deals left and right,
but they can't build a thing if we can't

08:01.360 --> 08:03.870
deliver the resources
to build it with.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.950
Well, I guess we can
kiss our bonuses goodbye.

08:10.860 --> 08:12.723
We're not going to get through this
shelf before the end of the year,

08:12.730 --> 08:15.630
so do you want to change locations
before we kill another bit?

08:18.660 --> 08:23.250
No, not when every report says
water is just a few meters down.

08:23.320 --> 08:24.619
I'm not drilling another hole.

08:24.620 --> 08:26.850
This is it.

08:26.920 --> 08:29.220
And we're getting water today.

08:29.290 --> 08:31.130
Old school.

08:31.190 --> 08:33.190
Explosives.

08:58.320 --> 09:01.760
It's still hard to believe such a
minor mutation could behave this way.

09:01.820 --> 09:03.690
It's fascinating, really.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.730
Yes.

09:06.030 --> 09:09.130
But not worth the price we
paid, allowing us to study it.

09:09.530 --> 09:10.950
You couldn't have known.

09:11.020 --> 09:13.280
Cameron said it
presented identically.

09:15.420 --> 09:17.990
The environments
weren't identical.

09:18.060 --> 09:20.320
And I could have insisted
on different protocols.

09:20.330 --> 09:22.130
I should have.

09:22.190 --> 09:24.060
Marta.

09:24.460 --> 09:26.960
Lukrum's within hours of
reaching liquid water.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.380
Of course.

09:29.450 --> 09:32.450
Of course they'd be the
ones to get to it first.

09:32.620 --> 09:35.220
The idea of a second genesis and
all it could unlock for science,

09:35.290 --> 09:36.889
it means nothing to them.

09:36.890 --> 09:39.360
The reason I know it's happening
is because Kurt reached out.

09:39.430 --> 09:42.130
He's invited you to
go collect samples.

09:45.220 --> 09:47.020
Careful guys.

09:48.920 --> 09:52.259
Don't want anyone to get hurt,
just want to get what we're after.

09:52.260 --> 09:54.190
Walking it in slowly, sir.

09:54.260 --> 09:57.260
Alright, let's get
it lowered and get it done.

10:00.170 --> 10:02.780
Initiating final
prep before detonation.

10:03.350 --> 10:05.889
Take it all the way down.

10:05.890 --> 10:07.420
Keep an eye
on that heat exchange.

10:07.490 --> 10:09.020
Are you okay
with what he's doing?

10:09.110 --> 10:11.330
Yeah, I mean, I have to be.

10:11.390 --> 10:13.360
- Do you?
- Jen, he's our boss.

10:13.430 --> 10:15.923
I know, I just, I don't think he's
thought it all the way through.

10:15.930 --> 10:19.220
We do this sort of thing on Earth all
the time, but we don't know how...

10:19.280 --> 10:21.820
Stop. Talking.

10:23.420 --> 10:26.989
What are you saying, that we're not
friends, that I can't talk to you about

10:26.990 --> 10:30.459
something that's bothering me,
like detonating explosives.

10:30.460 --> 10:34.200
We're getting
find water, follow orders.

10:35.750 --> 10:38.290
That's what we're going to do.

10:44.390 --> 10:45.830
You hear we're
making the deadline?

10:45.900 --> 10:48.400
Yeah, with a little help.

10:50.850 --> 10:52.583
You know, why don't
you to add some boosters, too.

10:52.590 --> 10:54.450
Make sure we get
this in one shot.

10:54.520 --> 10:56.750
Yes, sir.

10:58.820 --> 11:01.360
Can I get your bag for you?

11:03.930 --> 11:06.160
Marta, come on up front.

11:09.890 --> 11:11.690
Glad you could make it.

11:11.750 --> 11:13.450
I appreciate you having me.

11:13.520 --> 11:16.360
Though I must say I
didn't expect the invite.

11:16.430 --> 11:19.130
Well, we know how much this water
thing means to you science types.

11:19.900 --> 11:21.860
To be honest, it wasn't my idea.

11:21.930 --> 11:24.420
You have a fan back home.

11:31.960 --> 11:33.520
Your daughter?

11:33.590 --> 11:36.390
Name's Chelsea, and she wants to be
a microbiologist when she grows up.

11:37.300 --> 11:40.160
Go figure?

11:47.420 --> 11:50.090
Incoming call from Lukrum
Colony, Robert Foucault.

11:51.160 --> 11:52.430
Long time.

11:52.490 --> 11:53.690
How are you, my friend?

11:53.700 --> 11:55.130
I should be asking you.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.300
How's the baby?

11:56.370 --> 11:57.650
Same.

11:57.720 --> 11:59.380
Which is good enough for now.

11:59.450 --> 12:00.750
Nice outfit.

12:00.820 --> 12:02.490
Yeah, I'm
still getting used to it.

12:02.550 --> 12:05.290
Listen, how do you feel about
the use of controlled explosives

12:05.360 --> 12:07.720
at a depth of around 300 meters?

12:07.730 --> 12:09.530
I'm not sure.

12:09.600 --> 12:12.300
Still a lot of unknowns about
what's beneath the surface.

12:12.870 --> 12:17.950
It's an old strike slip zone, but most
think the planet's core has gone cold.

12:18.020 --> 12:20.290
It doesn't mean it's
a good idea, though.

12:20.360 --> 12:23.620
But if that's what you guys are doing,
you really should share it with Hana.

12:24.360 --> 12:26.230
Yeah, why
don't you tell her, then?

12:26.300 --> 12:27.900
You can't tell her yourself?

12:27.960 --> 12:29.160
Just tell her, okay?

12:29.230 --> 12:30.979
'Cause they're doing it today.

12:30.980 --> 12:32.849
IMSF should have been notified.

12:32.850 --> 12:34.319
I should have been notified.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.319
Not like they
ever ask for permission.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.820
Doesn't mean I
can't demand an explanation.

12:39.160 --> 12:40.859
What time did Robert
say it was happening?

12:40.860 --> 12:42.290
He didn't.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.459
Mae, contact Lukrum Command.

12:44.460 --> 12:48.820
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, go.

13:03.370 --> 13:06.320
I had no idea you
were going to use explosives.

13:06.390 --> 13:08.850
Did you get clearance for that?

13:09.050 --> 13:11.319
Sensors tripped.

13:11.320 --> 13:12.860
Water's making its
way to the surface.

13:12.930 --> 13:17.060
Whoa, whoa, found it?
We found water, baby!

13:17.400 --> 13:18.800
Whatever works, right?

13:18.860 --> 13:20.000
- Nice job.
- Whoo!

13:20.070 --> 13:21.749
Alright, let's go take
a look at what we came for.

13:21.750 --> 13:23.150
You coming?

13:23.220 --> 13:25.420
Yeah.

13:43.960 --> 13:46.590
Water.

13:49.530 --> 13:51.500
So your pipes are heated, then.

13:51.560 --> 13:54.450
Well, last thing we need is more
ice to form on the surface.

13:54.880 --> 13:57.220
Hey guys, let's make a hole.

13:58.550 --> 14:00.813
When that water comes through, I'm gonna
want the lady to get her samples.

14:00.820 --> 14:03.860
And there it is.

14:04.960 --> 14:07.600
My God, water.

14:09.030 --> 14:11.770
Go ahead. Get your samples.

14:13.850 --> 14:15.890
Damn you, you found it.

14:18.120 --> 14:20.090
You really found it.

14:20.160 --> 14:24.430
We were going to get it sooner or
later, and sooner's always better.

14:29.250 --> 14:31.620
You think there's life in that?

14:31.690 --> 14:34.090
I know there is.

14:50.260 --> 14:53.890
Get to the bus!
Let's go, you're with me.

15:16.250 --> 15:18.480
Get down, get down!

15:27.460 --> 15:29.590
The hull's been
breached, everybody out!

15:29.600 --> 15:31.860
Everyone get to the buses!

15:34.420 --> 15:36.250
Go, go, go!

15:46.190 --> 15:49.260
Go, go, go, let's go!

16:00.060 --> 16:01.380
Help!

16:01.390 --> 16:03.430
Everyone take cover!

16:29.720 --> 16:32.090
What's happening!

16:41.070 --> 16:43.550
- Is she okay?
- Yeah.

16:43.620 --> 16:46.190
Are you?

16:46.820 --> 16:48.160
System status.

16:48.220 --> 16:49.889
Primary systems functional.

16:49.890 --> 16:51.220
Structural breaches?

16:51.230 --> 16:52.630
Negativ.

16:52.690 --> 16:54.029
Contact Lukrum Command.

16:54.030 --> 16:55.960
They must have gotten hit
a lot harder than us.

16:56.030 --> 16:57.780
Unable
to initiate communication.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.380
Lukrum Colony shows
no signs of activity.

17:22.760 --> 17:24.420
Jen, you all right?

17:24.490 --> 17:26.089
Yeah? Okay.

17:26.160 --> 17:28.060
Shep, I'm headed back
to the colony, okay?

17:28.130 --> 17:29.429
I'm leaving you in charge.

17:29.430 --> 17:30.763
Are you sure you
don't want us to go with you?

17:30.770 --> 17:32.373
No, you stay here and make
sure everybody else is okay,

17:32.380 --> 17:33.980
and get a load up
on another bus.

17:34.050 --> 17:35.113
- Alright.
- Are you hurt at all?

17:35.120 --> 17:37.250
- We did this.
- I know Jen, I know.

17:37.320 --> 17:39.620
- Come with me.
- What?

17:39.990 --> 17:42.383
I can't be responsible for anything else
happening to an Olympus Town crew member

17:42.390 --> 17:43.730
on my watch.

17:43.800 --> 17:45.393
The safest place to be
right now is in a vehicle.

17:45.400 --> 17:46.760
I need you to go, now.

17:46.830 --> 17:48.349
Come on.

17:48.350 --> 17:50.380
Distress beacon detected
at Lukrum Colony.

17:50.450 --> 17:51.750
That's something, at least.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.089
Keep trying to make contact.

17:53.090 --> 17:54.319
We've done a head count.

17:54.320 --> 17:56.083
Just a few minor injuries,
mostly rattled nerves here.

17:56.090 --> 17:57.620
Still nothing.

17:57.690 --> 18:00.370
Well we know that they have survivors,
so let's deploy rescue teams.

18:00.600 --> 18:02.193
We'll head out first
with the medical team.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.680
Thank God Robert modified those
rovers for faster speeds.

18:17.100 --> 18:20.200
It was my call.

18:26.760 --> 18:30.190
Doesn't make a difference that
it fell right on time, does it?

18:32.660 --> 18:36.860
The road to hell is paved
with our best intentions.

18:43.190 --> 18:45.159
Will we make mistakes on Mars?

18:45.160 --> 18:46.420
Yes.

18:46.490 --> 18:48.630
Will things happen that were
unintended consequences?

18:48.690 --> 18:50.430
Yes.

18:51.030 --> 18:55.280
Human cultures have these checks and balances
that they come to sometimes the hard way.

18:56.020 --> 18:58.650
We are still in dialogue
with the natural world,

18:58.720 --> 19:03.590
and now the response comes roaring back
and says, "You think you're in charge?"

19:03.860 --> 19:09.599
I see climate change as a message from
our planet that is being spoken to us

19:09.600 --> 19:13.580
in a language of floods
and fires and droughts,

19:13.890 --> 19:18.390
and what it is telling us is
you have been living a dream.

19:18.460 --> 19:20.820
Every action has a reaction.

19:20.990 --> 19:23.860
A powerful earthquake rattled
central Oklahoma Saturday.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.700
A 5.6 quak.

19:25.760 --> 19:28.150
Linked to the practice of
fracking deep into the earth.

19:28.220 --> 19:32.520
The latest epicenter of concern over
Oklahoma's oil and gas industr.

19:34.220 --> 19:36.860
The planet is changing now, partly
as a result of human activity.

19:39.860 --> 19:41.823
Today's type of flight is
going to be a sea ice flight.

19:41.830 --> 19:44.710
We're going to heard out to the north
of Greenland into the Arctic Ocean.

19:46.620 --> 19:49.520
In some ways, the decline of Arctic
sea ice is probably the most dramatic

19:49.590 --> 19:52.420
story in all of climate change.

19:53.460 --> 19:56.560
Carbon dioxide from cars,
trucks and power plants is

19:56.630 --> 19:59.429
driving the rise in
global temperature.

19:59.430 --> 20:03.020
The Arctic is warming faster
than any other place on Earth.

20:03.080 --> 20:07.250
Satellite data revealed Greenland is
losing 100 billion tons of ice each year.

20:09.060 --> 20:12.190
We see entire buildings worth of ice
disappearing just in the course of a year.

20:12.530 --> 20:14.890
So some scientists think
that all Arctic sea ice

20:14.960 --> 20:17.729
will disappear in
just a few decades.

20:17.730 --> 20:20.020
We're doing that
ourselves to some degree.

20:20.090 --> 20:23.950
We have the technology and the capability
to effect planet scale environments.

20:24.760 --> 20:26.560
We're a powerful species, right.

20:26.630 --> 20:31.260
But if we don't recognize that and make
the changes, then we're going down.

20:32.630 --> 20:36.050
I'm hopeful that we've learned
lessons as humans on Earth.

20:36.120 --> 20:40.450
But when we go to Mars, it
almost doesn't matter because

20:40.460 --> 20:46.160
the cost of being foolish on Mars
is so high that you will fail.

20:51.550 --> 20:54.890
What's happening?
Ma'am, what should we do?

20:55.550 --> 20:57.890
It happened 20 minutes ago.

20:57.960 --> 21:01.090
There's nothing we can do.

21:04.530 --> 21:07.130
- Sir.
- What is it?

21:07.900 --> 21:09.680
There's been a quake on Mars.

21:09.750 --> 21:11.590
It seems to have
started near the drill site.

21:29.690 --> 21:32.419
The live stream footage shows
what's been called a Mars quake

21:32.420 --> 21:35.660
at the site of the drilling
operation led by Lukrum Industries.

21:42.520 --> 21:44.482
Perhaps then we'll have
the answer to the question

21:44.490 --> 21:47.120
what triggered the quake,

21:47.190 --> 21:49.860
and what does it mean for the
future of colonizing Mars?

22:04.760 --> 22:06.920
Wow. Dear God.

22:26.400 --> 22:28.730
The people over there.

22:30.270 --> 22:32.220
Hey, who have we got on the bus?

22:32.280 --> 22:34.650
Come in. Come in!

22:34.720 --> 22:39.160
Foucault here. And 12 others, I'm
not sure how many more are inside.

22:40.690 --> 22:42.190
Copy.

22:43.760 --> 22:44.840
I'm going in. You stay put.

22:44.900 --> 22:46.160
I'm going with you.

22:46.170 --> 22:48.250
Kurt, Kurt.

22:48.320 --> 22:51.130
No. This is on me.

23:55.020 --> 23:57.750
What'd I do?

24:06.490 --> 24:08.860
I'm sorry.

24:17.890 --> 24:20.660
Dear God.

25:04.450 --> 25:07.350
Warning. Damage detected.

25:10.760 --> 25:13.090
Low pressure warning.

25:17.070 --> 25:20.180
Low pressure warning.
Oxygen level critical.

25:33.500 --> 25:35.449
All personnel here
are accounted for.

25:35.450 --> 25:37.250
Our systems are
fully operational.

25:37.320 --> 25:39.383
We've not been able to make
contact with Lukrum Colony,

25:39.390 --> 25:41.390
but we received their
distress signal.

25:41.460 --> 25:43.189
We're deploying
rescue teams now.

25:43.190 --> 25:45.290
I'll update you
when I know more.

25:46.060 --> 25:48.660
Ma'am. We've received
another communication.

25:48.730 --> 25:51.130
Roland St. John is on
his way to see you.

26:00.960 --> 26:04.230
My God.

26:06.900 --> 26:08.850
Hana, is that you?

26:08.920 --> 26:10.820
Robert! Where are you?

26:10.890 --> 26:12.990
In the bus,
just after the airlock.

26:13.050 --> 26:15.520
A bunch of us were able to get
inside before it all came down.

26:15.590 --> 26:17.390
Kurt's inside looking
for any others.

26:17.460 --> 26:18.590
This is Dr. Johar here.

26:18.660 --> 26:20.330
Is everyone all
right in there, Robert?

26:20.400 --> 26:21.760
Yeah, no injuries.

26:21.830 --> 26:23.450
But we only have so much oxygen.

26:23.530 --> 26:24.930
Is the vehicle functional?

26:25.000 --> 26:26.883
We tried to drive as far away
from the structure as we could,

26:26.890 --> 26:29.620
but it's no point in going much
further without EVA suits,

26:29.690 --> 26:31.890
and without knowing
how you guys were doing.

26:31.960 --> 26:34.890
More rovers are here to take everyone
back to Olympus Town safely.

26:34.960 --> 26:36.860
Hang in there while we go in.

26:36.930 --> 26:40.430
Okay. Hey. Be careful.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.620
We will. I'm glad you're safe.

26:44.690 --> 26:47.890
Yeah, me too.

26:49.620 --> 26:52.080
Okay, let's go.

26:58.130 --> 27:00.750
- Hana!
- Marta.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.150
I thought you were
at the drill site.

27:03.220 --> 27:05.020
I was. Kurt's inside.

27:05.090 --> 27:07.220
He's been in there for a while.

27:07.290 --> 27:09.330
Okay, let's go.

27:32.480 --> 27:35.290
We've got at least
one casualty here.

27:36.760 --> 27:38.190
Let's spread out.

27:38.260 --> 27:39.490
Go to the back.

27:39.560 --> 27:40.620
You guys be careful.

27:40.690 --> 27:42.359
Everyone stay in contact.

27:42.360 --> 27:43.690
Galley's in here.

27:43.700 --> 27:46.960
We can get to it if we move
this stuff out of the way.

27:56.790 --> 27:59.190
Jay.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.710
There are survivors.

28:01.750 --> 28:04.530
About half a dozen, by my count.

28:07.790 --> 28:09.820
Make that seven survivors.

28:09.890 --> 28:12.590
They'll need helmets and suits
to get them out of here, though.

28:12.760 --> 28:14.559
Thank God.

28:14.560 --> 28:17.560
Some weren't so lucky over here.

28:18.330 --> 28:19.900
Stay with them.

28:19.960 --> 28:22.380
I'll start on equipment
once we finish this sweep.

28:30.190 --> 28:31.660
Kurt!

28:31.730 --> 28:33.259
I think he's pinned.

28:33.260 --> 28:35.660
I need some help over here.

28:37.270 --> 28:40.520
Hang on I'm coming.

28:40.750 --> 28:43.150
Almost there.

28:58.120 --> 29:01.120
Is he okay?

29:04.960 --> 29:08.560
He's dead.

29:27.830 --> 29:29.980
What the hell.
Mae, systems check.

29:30.050 --> 29:31.919
Temporary power loss
self-corrected.

29:31.920 --> 29:34.050
No structural damage sustained.

29:34.060 --> 29:35.720
All systems functional.

29:35.790 --> 29:37.383
At least it was only
a three-second aftershock.

29:37.390 --> 29:38.989
That's three seconds too long.

29:38.990 --> 29:41.130
Comms, Medical Bay ISO room.

29:41.200 --> 29:44.729
Amelie. Amelie.

29:44.730 --> 29:46.750
Something's
wrong with the incubator.

29:46.820 --> 29:49.120
This indicator
light keeps flickering.

29:49.190 --> 29:52.760
It got banged up before, and when the power
went down, I don't know, maybe it's broken.

29:53.190 --> 29:54.220
Which indicator?

29:54.230 --> 29:55.430
Mae, O2 SAT reading.

29:55.490 --> 29:56.990
O2 SAT at 95%.

29:57.060 --> 29:58.340
What's going on?
Which indicator?

29:58.400 --> 29:59.760
The oxygen indicator.

29:59.830 --> 30:01.299
Mae says it's working fine.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.050
But it doesn't seem right.

30:03.120 --> 30:05.650
Something's wrong.

30:07.460 --> 30:09.790
It was due to circumstances
beyond our control.

30:09.860 --> 30:12.460
Do you really
expect anyone to believe that?

30:12.530 --> 30:15.460
Well, with your help and a
joint press conference, yes.

30:15.800 --> 30:19.750
With IMSF in our corner, you'd be amazed at
how much sway your outfit has in shaping

30:19.820 --> 30:21.720
positive public opinion.

30:21.790 --> 30:23.619
This is not the
same as the outbreak, Roland.

30:23.620 --> 30:25.450
This can't be contained.

30:25.520 --> 30:27.920
Visual and seismic evidence has
been shared around the world.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.560
I'm well aware.
But quakes aren't my concern.

30:30.630 --> 30:32.959
The perception that
Lukrum triggered one,

30:32.960 --> 30:34.660
that's, that's another story.

30:34.730 --> 30:36.449
You detonated
underground explosives.

30:36.450 --> 30:38.150
Yeah, on Mars.

30:38.220 --> 30:39.649
The world isn't just
reconsidering my

30:39.650 --> 30:41.650
organization's
impact on the planet.

30:41.660 --> 30:45.890
They're debating mankind's very presence
there, which impacts your organization.

30:46.860 --> 30:50.300
You have to understand that to assuage
public fears about colonization,

30:50.360 --> 30:54.620
we, you and I, have to
present a united front.

30:57.820 --> 30:59.520
I'll resign first.

31:01.290 --> 31:02.490
Really? What?

31:02.560 --> 31:04.823
So the entire world knows that
you, much like your late husband,

31:04.830 --> 31:07.800
were too weak to
handle the pressure?

31:09.350 --> 31:11.990
Look, there's no reason
why we can't coexist.

31:12.050 --> 31:14.390
I want IMSF to survive.

31:14.460 --> 31:16.890
As long as Lukrum's in control.

31:17.330 --> 31:19.330
Control's a harsh word.

31:19.390 --> 31:24.130
I see it as providing strong financial
support, and all that entails.

31:28.590 --> 31:30.750
How much financial support?

31:30.820 --> 31:33.290
Enough to keep
IMSF solvent for years.

31:33.360 --> 31:36.760
I can have funds transferred in less than a
minute, and contracts drawn up in an hour.

31:38.430 --> 31:42.320
And in return, our trusted organization
provides you with political cover.

31:44.320 --> 31:47.620
A small price to
pay to keep the doors open.

31:49.260 --> 31:50.660
I'm not seeing anything.

31:50.730 --> 31:52.459
Warning, O2 SAT at 90%.

31:52.460 --> 31:53.990
What's going on?
What does that mean?

31:54.060 --> 31:55.659
Her oxygen

None of it is working.

What can we do, Amelie?

32:23.360 --> 32:24.720
Amelie!

32:27.460 --> 32:28.890
I have to extubate her.

32:28.960 --> 32:31.400
Warning, O2 SAT is at 87%.

32:31.900 --> 32:33.880

She has to.

32:35.820 --> 32:38.960
Otherwise she won't be able to breathe
at all with this tube in her airway.

32:39.660 --> 32:40.820
Are you sure?

32:40.830 --> 32:42.960
Yes.

32:43.930 --> 32:45.229
No.

Warning, O2 SAT is at...

33:13.360 --> 33:16.060
Two unmanned Voyager spacecraft
like this are now on their way

33:16.130 --> 33:19.260
toward the planets
Jupiter and Saturn.

33:19.330 --> 33:22.030
The program is designed to
yield valuable new information

33:22.070 --> 33:24.580
about the origins of
the solar system.

33:24.650 --> 33:27.450
One of the ways it will
do this is with pictures.

33:28.560 --> 33:33.329
We have lift-off of the first of
two Voyager spacecraft to extend

33:33.330 --> 33:37.160
man's senses further into the
solar system than ever before.

33:43.150 --> 33:48.490
When Carl Sagan convinced the head
of NASA to turn around the Voyager

33:48.560 --> 33:54.429
spacecraft and take a picture of
Earth, we saw Earth in a perspective

33:54.430 --> 33:56.980
that we have never seen before.

33:57.690 --> 34:03.020
Here is the, the Earth in a
sunbeam, and you can see it.

34:04.660 --> 34:08.130
It is in fact less
than a pixel in size,

34:08.199 --> 34:11.360
and this is where we live.

34:11.429 --> 34:13.850
On a blue dot.

34:17.420 --> 34:20.520
There is no evidence
suggesting life anywhere else.

34:20.960 --> 34:27.199
For me, that underscores the rarity and
preciousness of the earth and the life upon it.

34:27.870 --> 34:30.780
We see our smallness when we
look out at the universe.

34:30.790 --> 34:35.590
Our individual lives, and even our civilization,
is not that significant on a cosmic scale.

34:38.790 --> 34:43.560
On that blue dot, that's where everyone
you know and everyone you ever heard of,

34:43.630 --> 34:48.820
every human being who ever
lived, lived out their lives.

34:50.219 --> 34:53.020
What comes out of our cosmic
insignificance is compassion,

34:53.090 --> 34:57.790
a deep, profound, and cosmic
compassion for all living things.

35:01.130 --> 35:04.220
But we're having a hard time.

35:06.120 --> 35:10.390
We're engaged in this battle for
how we act as a planetary species.

35:13.790 --> 35:17.960
Astronomy has always been said
to be a humbling experience.

35:20.220 --> 35:24.920
I think this perspective
underscores our responsibility

35:25.160 --> 35:27.920
to preserve and cherish

35:27.990 --> 35:33.360
that blue dot, the
only home we have.

35:33.430 --> 35:35.973
One of the beautiful things that Carl
Sagan showed us is that with the cosmic

35:35.980 --> 35:39.750
view was our recognition
that we're all in it together.

35:40.250 --> 35:44.090
Space exploration
brings out the best in us.

35:44.790 --> 35:48.560
It's where we solve problems that
have never been solved before.

35:48.860 --> 35:52.350
One of the things that humans have
learned is that when lives are in danger

35:52.420 --> 35:57.089
and everything is in danger of falling apart,
if they come together and support each

35:57.090 --> 36:00.290
other, they can get
through a crisis.

36:09.180 --> 36:11.480
Let's get everyone set up with
water and food right away.

36:11.550 --> 36:13.650
Thank you for
opening your doors to us.

36:13.660 --> 36:14.913
I know you people
probably don't want

36:14.920 --> 36:16.720
anything to do with
Lukrum right now, but...

36:16.790 --> 36:18.660
We're all in this together.

36:18.730 --> 36:20.329
We'll get you set up
with everything you need.

36:20.330 --> 36:21.730
Thank you.

36:21.800 --> 36:23.860
Commander.

36:24.470 --> 36:26.180
You don't need to call me that.

36:26.250 --> 36:28.780
Well, seems appropriate since
you're everyone's commander now.

36:30.490 --> 36:33.090
I don't know how
we're going to fit everybody.

36:33.160 --> 36:35.023
We're not equipped to
house this many people, but.

36:35.030 --> 36:37.290
Lucky for us,
I'm pretty good at building.

36:37.360 --> 36:39.829
We'll make it work.

36:39.830 --> 36:41.699
We'll make it work.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.843
Commander, we need to get out
of these and into Medical Bay.

36:43.850 --> 36:46.250
It's about the baby.

37:06.560 --> 37:09.590
She's breathing on her own.

37:10.360 --> 37:13.000
She's stronger than we thought.

37:14.570 --> 37:18.050
- Gabriella.
- That's Hana.

37:19.020 --> 37:22.220
Hello.

37:23.190 --> 37:24.720
Recording.

37:24.730 --> 37:28.690
Commander Seung, Hana, there's
something you need to know.

37:30.060 --> 37:35.220
I've signed a contract with Lukrum Industries,
but I want you to understand why.

37:51.350 --> 37:54.450
You okay?

37:54.520 --> 37:58.190
Obviously a lot to clean up and repair
before I can continue my work, but...

38:00.660 --> 38:04.000
At least we got this.

38:05.130 --> 38:07.480
What could be a second genesis.

38:07.490 --> 38:10.750
Findings that could change our
understanding of the universe.

38:11.660 --> 38:14.290
Of us.

38:14.360 --> 38:20.030
And we wouldn't have it if it weren't for the
man I'd spent a year hating with a passion.

38:21.700 --> 38:24.450
I know.

38:26.590 --> 38:29.120
Let me know when the
next of kin has been notified.

38:29.190 --> 38:31.260
I'd like to send a
message to his daughter.

38:33.130 --> 38:36.560
She should know her father was
proud of her interest in science.

38:38.930 --> 38:41.950
Of course.

38:51.430 --> 38:54.730
In our goal of colonizing,
it is not without risk.

38:54.900 --> 38:59.050
But to paraphrase a friend, bad
things happen on Earth, too.

39:01.320 --> 39:07.330
And while the quake caused significant
damage, know that we could neither have

39:07.400 --> 39:11.230
predicted it, nor
prevented it from happening.

39:12.200 --> 39:15.349
Also know that we
will persevere.

39:15.350 --> 39:19.790
And more than
that, we will rebuild.

39:35.060 --> 39:38.860
Let me begin by
apologizing on behalf of IMSF.

39:39.390 --> 39:42.090
We've been misleading you.

39:42.230 --> 39:45.980
For years, we've been overly
protective of our brave astronauts,

39:47.220 --> 39:51.250
and less than transparent about the hardships
that they have faced on this mission.

39:51.960 --> 39:55.820
Before I became secretary
general, I was Dr. Richardson.

39:55.830 --> 39:58.960
I was a scientist.

39:59.560 --> 40:03.920
My husband and I had the honor of
traveling to Mars for Phase 2,

40:03.980 --> 40:08.990
and I remember distinctly
thinking how far away Earth felt,

40:09.720 --> 40:11.860
how distant IMSF seemed,

40:12.590 --> 40:17.030
and that no one knew what it
was like to be where we were.

40:20.950 --> 40:26.420
So when we're standing here talking
about what happened on Mars,

40:26.490 --> 40:32.860
and the future of Mars, we
do so without understanding.

40:34.630 --> 40:39.220
Ultimately it's neither me,
nor Roland, nor anybody

40:39.290 --> 40:42.290
on Earth you should
be hearing from.

40:46.890 --> 40:48.990
You're off script.

40:50.930 --> 40:55.120
Greetings, I'm Hana Seung, commander
of the IMSF Mars mission.

40:56.120 --> 40:59.150
It's been 10 years since
we set foot here on Mars.

40:59.160 --> 41:02.359
10 challenging,
but rewarding years.

41:02.360 --> 41:05.560
And in that time, we've
learned a few things.

41:06.000 --> 41:09.550
The importance of trust,
unity, and collaboration.

41:11.450 --> 41:14.119
Lukrum Industries has been a
valuable partner in our efforts to

41:14.120 --> 41:16.790
terraform the planet.

41:17.360 --> 41:20.390
But their aggressive methods, including
the use of underground explosives

41:20.460 --> 41:25.660
that triggered a quake must be looked
at, monitored and kept in check.

41:29.150 --> 41:30.953
This is essential not only
for those of us who are here.

41:30.960 --> 41:33.089
What the hell are you doing?
My job.

41:33.090 --> 41:35.190
But for the
future of Mars itself.

41:35.260 --> 41:36.890
Protecting
Mars, and saving IMSF.

41:36.960 --> 41:40.930
We at IMSF are pioneers, here to
explore the planet, not to exploit it.

41:42.430 --> 41:46.049
We've done plenty of that on Earth,
and we've paid a price for it,

41:46.050 --> 41:49.220
with devastating consequences.

41:49.290 --> 41:52.930
We're not here to repeat history;
We're here to understand,

41:52.990 --> 41:58.960
and to grow, and to respect, both
the planet, and one another.

42:00.020 --> 42:04.620
That's the only way we can ever hope
to successfully live here as a people.

42:04.690 --> 42:07.260
And we do carry that hope.

42:07.320 --> 42:09.290
With the newest
member of our colony.

42:09.490 --> 42:10.960
You're not
getting away with this.

42:11.030 --> 42:12.290
I already have.

42:12.360 --> 42:14.300
That is now more true than ever.

42:14.360 --> 42:17.750
Earth, meet
Gabriella Durand Delgado.

42:20.350 --> 42:23.490
Gabriella, meet Earth.

42:42.030 --> 42:45.260
Life here is possible.

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
Thanks for the
wire transfer, by the way.

42:53.090 --> 42:55.620
We're here to stay.

43:14.620 --> 43:18.660
Going to space
changes you fundamentally.

43:19.400 --> 43:23.550
I was shaking and rocking and moving, and my
eyes are just seeing these green and blue

43:23.620 --> 43:25.880
lights from the displays.

43:29.160 --> 43:33.560
Two and a half minutes, it gets quieter
as the solid rocket boosters jettison.

43:35.330 --> 43:38.330
Six and a half minutes later,
we're now in space.

43:38.770 --> 43:41.250
And I was just blown away.

43:41.320 --> 43:46.620
You see this thin blue line,
our atmosphere, and it's like,

43:46.690 --> 43:49.890
wow, that's what keeps us alive?

43:50.060 --> 43:53.160
- That's amazing, isn't it?
- It is beautiful.

43:53.230 --> 43:57.720
When you see the bigger picture, it
makes you really be cognizant of what

43:57.780 --> 43:59.850
we're doing to our environment.

43:59.920 --> 44:03.460
You see these places are getting
decimated by climate change.

44:03.890 --> 44:05.889
And you can see
the urban sprawl.

44:05.890 --> 44:09.960
The Amazon forest burning.
These systems of hurricanes.

44:11.230 --> 44:13.119
There's Leland, Randy.

44:13.120 --> 44:15.780
I got this
awareness of my planet.

44:15.790 --> 44:18.589
Hey. Awesome.

44:18.590 --> 44:23.929
The more people that can go to space and
see what it looks like would cherish

44:23.930 --> 44:28.660
that beauty, but also see how we're all
connected in such a masterful way.

44:32.490 --> 44:36.320
I don't think Greenpeace alone can
solve the problems of Planet Earth,

44:36.390 --> 44:40.630
but in order to save this planet,
we have to really trust each other.

44:41.300 --> 44:45.160
One of the things that I hope is for
scientists and government agencies to work

44:45.170 --> 44:48.450
hand in hand with industry as
opposed to each group working

44:48.520 --> 44:50.650
in some sort of
adversarial relationship.

45:03.780 --> 45:05.880
We make a lot of mistakes
as people, as societies,

45:05.890 --> 45:09.190
but I think that we have the
tools to right those mistakes.

45:09.260 --> 45:12.660
When things get
dark, they get better.

45:13.790 --> 45:17.030
What most motivates me about Mars is
that I think it's an opportunity to do a

45:17.100 --> 45:23.020
reset on a new planet, to rethink things
and maybe have an improved system.

45:24.340 --> 45:27.320
We have the capability to
look at our human history,

45:27.390 --> 45:32.290
to look at how our past choices
have impacted our environment,

45:32.360 --> 45:38.480
so that we can make Mars not just a
second replication of human society,

45:38.550 --> 45:43.320
but to make it something better than
we've created here on this planet.

45:44.230 --> 45:45.689
Let's do it together.

45:45.690 --> 45:47.890
Let's not make it a
conflict situation.

45:48.500 --> 45:53.150
We can develop in a sustainable way here
on Earth, and as we move outward into

45:53.220 --> 45:55.780
the solar system.

45:56.190 --> 45:58.320
I absolutely expect there
will be conflict on Mars,

45:58.390 --> 46:03.059
but I think everyone will be so conscious
of the challenge, it might really inspire

46:03.060 --> 46:05.290
our better natures.

46:06.400 --> 46:09.430
Gabriella, Gabriella.

46:09.880 --> 46:11.720
Come here.

46:19.660 --> 46:21.990
Go to the left.

46:22.300 --> 46:24.100
A little more.

46:24.330 --> 46:27.150
Zoom in right there.

46:28.850 --> 46:31.420
Right there.

46:32.720 --> 46:34.860
Our first cloud.
