WEBVTT

00:05.863 --> 00:06.863
oh, my god...

00:07.487 --> 00:09.128
this is good.

00:14.565 --> 00:16.613
I mean... really good.

00:17.175 --> 00:18.612
It's delicious.

00:19.768 --> 00:20.800
What did you say this was again?

00:22.206 --> 00:23.300
I didn't, actually.

00:24.378 --> 00:25.362
It's just an old recipe.

00:26.284 --> 00:28.144
I'm sorry, I...

00:28.284 --> 00:30.238
haven't seen you in...

00:30.566 --> 00:32.112
well, gosh,
it seems like forever.

00:32.409 --> 00:34.800
All I can talk about is
the food.

00:35.737 --> 00:36.550
How have you been?

00:36.550 --> 00:39.456
Well.
Very well, as a
matter of fact.

00:41.175 --> 00:42.128
And what about you?

00:42.425 --> 00:45.112
I see you went and
got yourself inked up.

00:46.613 --> 00:48.940
Oh... (quiet laugh)
yeah.

00:50.113 --> 00:53.503
Me and the boys had a little bit
too much to drink one night.

00:53.566 --> 00:56.237
When I woke up,
I had this tattoo.

01:02.862 --> 01:06.378
I'm sorry.
I really hate to nag, but, uh,

01:07.191 --> 01:09.112
this is the best thing
I've ever tasted.

01:10.112 --> 01:12.113
Please, you have to tell me
what it is.

01:12.722 --> 01:14.363
Sometimes it's better
not to know.

01:15.144 --> 01:17.987
Come on, what is it?
Filet? Tenderloin?

01:18.566 --> 01:19.925
You're sure you want
me to tell you?

01:20.362 --> 01:21.550
Oh, I'm sure.

01:22.300 --> 01:24.987
Okay. But I'm
surprised
you haven't figured
it out yet.

01:25.941 --> 01:27.659
That meat you're
enjoying so much?

01:27.659 --> 01:31.191
The secret
ingredient...
is you.

01:33.815 --> 01:34.737
we're eating you.

01:36.300 --> 01:38.363
Your right leg,
to be exact.

01:39.550 --> 01:41.269
Look for yourself.
You'll see.

灵媒缉凶  第4季 第6集</font>

02:48.393 --> 02:52.175
Well, there was definitely
nothing literal about my dream.

02:52.175 --> 02:53.690
But the guy in it,
he, he was young.

02:53.690 --> 02:57.347
He was like 20, 21, uh...

02:57.347 --> 02:59.253
oh, he had dark, shaggy hair.

03:00.440 --> 03:03.690
Oh, he also had a, uh, a tattoo
on his arm.

03:03.690 --> 03:06.503
It was like an eight ball
with fire all around it.

03:07.315 --> 03:08.440
I don't know what to tell you,
allison.

03:08.440 --> 03:10.284
No one matching that description
has been reported missing.

03:10.284 --> 03:11.800
Or turned up dead.

03:12.363 --> 03:14.206
lee, can you hold on a second?

03:14.206 --> 03:15.721
I'm getting another call. Sorry.

03:18.300 --> 03:18.925
Hello?

03:19.238 --> 03:22.050
Hello. Is this allison dubois?

03:22.050 --> 03:22.999
Yes?

03:22.999 --> 03:26.222
This is mrs. Desai from
the ubient credit corporation.

03:26.222 --> 03:30.675
I'm calling to inform you
that your accois more
than 90 days past due.

03:30.675 --> 03:33.737
Well, I appreciate
your heads up, mrs. Desai.

03:33.737 --> 03:35.112
But you know what?
We already know that.

03:35.112 --> 03:37.738
Someone from your company has
been nice enough

03:37.738 --> 03:41.628
to call us every single day
to remind us.

03:41.628 --> 03:44.425
Now, if you can't arrange to
make the minimum payment soon,

03:44.425 --> 03:47.441
I'm afraid your credit cards are
going to be frozen.

03:47.550 --> 03:49.534
Yeah, you know what?
We know that, too.

03:50.925 --> 03:53.644
we want to pay you.
We really do.

03:53.644 --> 03:55.425
And we will, as soon as we can.

03:55.425 --> 03:57.237
I'm sorry,
I have to get off now.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.316
'Cause I have another call.

04:01.300 --> 04:02.175
Lee, sorry about that.

04:02.175 --> 04:04.737
Uh, no problem.
I'll keep an eye out, okay?

04:05.190 --> 04:06.112
Thanks.

04:07.612 --> 04:08.175
So, you're fairly confident

04:08.175 --> 04:11.237
that cassandra baldwin would
make a good juror?

04:11.237 --> 04:13.300
She's perfect for you.

04:13.675 --> 04:15.613
I think thatilhe wl
vote to acquit.

04:17.503 --> 04:18.550
Sir?

04:19.346 --> 04:20.300
Hm...?

04:21.565 --> 04:23.050
I'm sorry, allison.
The truth is,

04:23.050 --> 04:26.253
my mind isn't really
on this jury at the moment.

04:28.237 --> 04:30.472
actually, there's something else

04:30.472 --> 04:31.863
I would like to discuss
with you.

04:35.112 --> 04:37.753
I had dinner last night with an
old colleague-- jed garrity. 

04:37.753 --> 04:39.800
He was a judge
when I was a junior prosecutor.

04:39.800 --> 04:42.581
He's served
as a state senator for...

04:42.581 --> 04:43.999
more than a decade now.

04:44.753 --> 04:46.175
It was quite
an interesting evening.

04:46.175 --> 04:48.238
Apparently,
there's some dissatisfaction

04:48.238 --> 04:49.800
with the way tom van dyke is

04:49.800 --> 04:51.675
handling himself
as district attorney.

04:51.690 --> 04:53.253
Imagine that.

04:54.425 --> 04:56.300
Van dyke is up
for reelection soon.

04:57.675 --> 04:59.488
There are some people
who are disappointed

04:59.488 --> 05:01.144
that he's running unopposed.

05:01.144 --> 05:02.925
Senator garrity among them.

05:04.863 --> 05:06.253
Last night, garrity asked me
if I'd be interested

05:06.253 --> 05:07.988
in throwing my hat
into the ring.

05:08.363 --> 05:09.800
So what did you say?

05:09.800 --> 05:12.253
Oh, I told him
that I was, uh, content

05:12.253 --> 05:15.050
to languish in a rented office
on the edge of downtown.

05:15.050 --> 05:16.518
I also told him that I...

05:16.518 --> 05:18.800
always imagined spending
the autumn of my career

05:18.800 --> 05:21.362
picking up cases on a
catch-as-catch-can basis.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.112
What do you think
I said?

05:23.800 --> 05:25.800
I imld h I'm excited.

05:26.738 --> 05:29.785
I told him that I miss serving
the city of phoenix.

05:29.785 --> 05:32.894
I, uh, that I'd be thrilled
to stand for the job.

05:32.894 --> 05:35.238
Oh, that's great news.
I'm so happy for you.

05:35.238 --> 05:37.597
I have to admit
I'm happy for me, too.

05:37.597 --> 05:38.862
But I'm trying to keep it
in check.

05:38.862 --> 05:39.925
This isn't going to be easy.

05:40.753 --> 05:43.191
The logistics of getting
a campaign up and running

05:43.191 --> 05:46.582
at this late date-- frankly,
they're... daunting.

05:46.582 --> 05:47.738
And... (sighs heavily)

05:48.999 --> 05:50.800
the senator's support
is conditional.

05:51.550 --> 05:52.999
Before he's willing
to endorse me,

05:52.999 --> 05:54.956
he has concerns
that need to be addressed,

05:54.956 --> 05:56.378
and chief among them is you.

05:56.378 --> 05:58.612
Hey, if it helps you
get your job back,

05:58.612 --> 06:02.362
I will happily crawl
under a rock
until after the election.

06:02.362 --> 06:05.175
well, I appreciate the offer,

06:05.175 --> 06:06.925
but I don't think that's
a realistic possibility.

06:06.925 --> 06:09.112
Reporters are quite good
at looking under rocks.

06:09.425 --> 06:10.363
Yeah.

06:10.503 --> 06:12.613
Senator garrity
would like to meet you.

06:13.363 --> 06:14.565
Tonight, as a matter of fact.

06:15.999 --> 06:17.737
If you're willing, the three
of us could have dinner.

06:17.737 --> 06:19.753
The senator could ask you
his questions,

06:19.753 --> 06:20.550
and, hopefully...

06:20.999 --> 06:21.999
that'll be that.

06:23.300 --> 06:24.738
Dad.
Yeah?

06:24.738 --> 06:25.815
I need to call hannah back,

06:25.815 --> 06:26.800
and bridgette won't get off
the phone.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.800
Well, I'm in the middle
of something, ariel.

06:28.800 --> 06:30.050
Just be patient.

06:30.050 --> 06:32.332
Yeah, but she's been on the
phone for, like, ten minutes.

06:32.332 --> 06:33.300
Who's she talking to?

06:33.300 --> 06:34.237
I don't know--

06:34.237 --> 06:36.425
some weird guy-- but she won't
say when she'll be done.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.581
well, just hold on for
a couple minutes, okay?

06:40.581 --> 06:41.800
I'm sure she'll be off soon.

06:41.800 --> 06:44.925
Really? You got to call somebody
in niagara falls?

06:44.925 --> 06:46.378
How many times?

06:46.566 --> 06:47.925
Bridgette,
who are you talking to?

06:49.362 --> 06:51.456
Can you hold on a
second, please?

06:51.503 --> 06:53.144
Mr. Reshmi.

06:53.425 --> 06:56.050
Have you ever talked
to anybody in alaska?

06:56.050 --> 06:57.769
Bridgette,
who is mr. Reshmi?

06:57.769 --> 07:00.238
He's the credit
card man.

07:00.238 --> 07:02.191
You're talking to somebody
from the credit card company?

07:03.112 --> 07:03.999
Give me the phone.

07:03.999 --> 07:06.207
But we were in
the middle of talking.

07:06.207 --> 07:07.769
Mr. Reshmi...

07:08.394 --> 07:10.737
hi.
Yeah, my name is
joseph dubois.

07:11.315 --> 07:13.222
I wonder if your supervisor
would be interested in learning

07:13.222 --> 07:14.612
you've spent
the last ten minutes

07:14.612 --> 07:16.925
chatting with a nine year old.

07:17.050 --> 07:18.503
That's right, nine.

07:19.238 --> 07:22.175
Well, all right,
let me be really clear
about something,

07:22.175 --> 07:23.737
I don't want you
calling here again.

07:23.737 --> 07:25.316
I don't want you
harassing my family.

07:26.190 --> 07:30.050
And if it continues,
then I'm going to call
the authorities.

07:30.175 --> 07:31.753
Good-bye.

07:34.862 --> 07:36.800
A hiker's dog sniffed him
out of a shallow grave

07:36.800 --> 07:38.050
in boyce park
this morning.

07:38.050 --> 07:39.769
Somebody stabbed him
a couple dozen times,

07:39.769 --> 07:41.800
then they dissected him
with a chain saw.

07:43.050 --> 07:44.300
The best bet is
your friend here died

07:44.300 --> 07:45.925
somewhere close
to midnight.

07:49.613 --> 07:51.440
That's the same tattoo
from my dream.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.425
Now, what would really
be helpful would be

07:54.425 --> 07:57.113
if you could give me a complete
description of this guy.

07:57.113 --> 07:58.721
A little something
more than, uh,

07:58.721 --> 08:01.675
four feet tall, no arms,
no legs, no head.

08:02.362 --> 08:04.300
You know, I could probably
also give you the description

08:04.300 --> 08:05.425
of the guy who did
this to him.

08:05.425 --> 08:07.175
What are you talking about?
You saw the murder?

08:07.175 --> 08:07.999
You never mentioned that.

08:07.999 --> 08:10.425
Well, not exactly.
It wasn't realistic.

08:10.425 --> 08:11.425
But there was a man
in the dream
who was definitely

08:11.425 --> 08:13.581
interested in his limbs.

08:14.362 --> 08:15.129
He wanted them...

08:15.284 --> 08:18.113
for food.

08:22.956 --> 08:24.363
Hubba, hubba.

08:24.363 --> 08:25.999
A hubba from the hubba.

08:25.999 --> 08:26.987
Well, that's good.

08:26.987 --> 08:28.628
But it's not too hubba, right?

08:28.628 --> 08:30.581
Mm, why do you ask?

08:31.846 --> 08:34.128
Well, devalos is too polite
to say anything,

08:34.128 --> 08:36.503
but I'm getting the feeling that
this endorsement hangs

08:36.503 --> 08:37.924
on whether or not
this garrity guy

08:37.924 --> 08:39.815
thinks I'm a complete nut job.

08:40.456 --> 08:42.049
I want to look nice...

08:42.361 --> 08:43.674
but sane.

08:44.049 --> 08:46.863
Well, you look very nice.
Very sane.

08:48.206 --> 08:49.487
But I do have to ask:

08:49.487 --> 08:51.128
Are you sure that you are okay

08:51.128 --> 08:53.050
with devalos campaigning
for his old job?

08:53.613 --> 08:55.050
What are you talking about?

08:55.612 --> 08:59.206
Well, campaigns mean publicity.
And publicity means reporters.

08:59.769 --> 09:01.999
Lots and lots of reporters.

09:01.999 --> 09:03.925
Asking questions,
writing things about you.

09:05.112 --> 09:07.316
It wasn't exactly a party
the first time around.

09:07.316 --> 09:09.144
Well, I don't feel like
I have a choice.

09:09.472 --> 09:12.300
Devalos isn't asking for my
permission to run for office.

09:12.300 --> 09:13.706
He's asking for my help.

09:13.706 --> 09:16.706
I know he's not thrilled
of what he's doing right now.

09:17.925 --> 09:19.597
And I feel partially responsible
for that.

09:19.597 --> 09:22.675
I'd really like help him get
back the one job in the world

09:22.675 --> 09:24.237
that makes him truly happy.

09:33.488 --> 09:35.800
Allison.
You look lovely.

09:36.753 --> 09:37.612
Thank you.

09:37.612 --> 09:38.238
Jed...

09:41.347 --> 09:44.128
 the secret ingredient
is you.

09:44.128 --> 09:47.300
 Allison dubois,
I'd like you to meet
senator jed garrity.

09:53.753 --> 09:54.315
Hey.Hi.

09:54.690 --> 09:55.487
Are the girls in bed?

09:55.487 --> 09:57.440
Uh, ariel'sdoing homework.

09:57.440 --> 09:58.894
Bridgette and marieare asleep.

09:58.894 --> 10:00.175
How'd dinner go?Oh...

10:00.628 --> 10:03.425
I passed musterwith the senator.
He's going to endorse devalos.

10:03.425 --> 10:05.425
They're scheduling a pressconference for friday.

10:06.347 --> 10:07.269
Oh, so that's a win, right?

10:07.269 --> 10:08.441
Yeah, it's great.

10:08.441 --> 10:11.238
I even managed to getthrough the meal
without accusing garrityof murder.

10:16.675 --> 10:19.471
You know, I spentthe whole afternoon
with a policesketch artist,

10:19.471 --> 10:24.191
giving hima perfect description
of an arizonastate senator.

10:27.581 --> 10:29.378
what if they distributethat sketch?

10:31.050 --> 10:33.362
who are you calling?
Scanlon.

10:34.690 --> 10:36.738
I got to stop them
before they putthat sketch out.

10:36.738 --> 10:39.128
Hi, this is detective...
(sighing): Ah, it'sgoing to voice mail.

10:39.441 --> 10:43.628
Lee.
It's allison.
Uh, listen, uh,

10:44.253 --> 10:47.363
that sketch that I did
with your artistthis afternoon?

10:47.363 --> 10:51.113
Um, do me a favor anddon't distribute it
until I talk to you.

10:51.285 --> 10:54.738
Okay, I guess I'll talkto you in the morning.

10:57.894 --> 10:59.550
your mom's going to betied up most of the day,

10:59.550 --> 11:01.175
so I'll be picking you upthis afternoon, okay?

11:01.300 --> 11:02.425
Okay, daddy.

11:02.425 --> 11:04.175
All right, kiddo.Give me a kiss.

11:05.175 --> 11:06.300
ByE.

11:08.050 --> 11:12.613
Daddy, how can we tellmr. Reshmi
that he needsto lock his back door?

11:12.613 --> 11:13.800
Tell who what?

11:13.800 --> 11:15.316
Mr. Reshmi.

11:15.316 --> 11:18.988
I had a dream that somebody
broke into the placewhere he lives.

11:18.988 --> 11:19.628
Mr. Reshmi?

11:21.113 --> 11:22.441
What, the credit card guy?

11:22.503 --> 11:24.800
You had a dreamabout the credit card guy?

11:24.800 --> 11:27.175
I saw his nameon the apartment door.

11:27.362 --> 11:30.800
These robbers, they came in
from the sliding doorin the back.

11:30.800 --> 11:32.190
I think they took a ring.

11:33.113 --> 11:35.613
Uh-huh, okay.
Well, look, bridge,

11:35.613 --> 11:37.487
like you said,it was just a dream.

11:37.487 --> 11:39.628
And even though you dreamt it,doesn't necessarily mean

11:39.628 --> 11:40.425
that it's going to happen.

11:40.425 --> 11:43.206
But I don't thinkit was just a dream.

11:43.238 --> 11:45.362
I think we need to warn him.

11:45.362 --> 11:46.988
Warn him? Bridge...

11:47.316 --> 11:49.378
okay, even if it was one of,you know, those dreams...

11:50.300 --> 11:52.612
there's no way of knowingwhether this is something that's

11:52.612 --> 11:54.315
going to happen or somethingthat's already happened.

11:54.362 --> 11:57.613
But either way, it couldn't hurtto warn him, could it?

11:57.999 --> 12:00.738
Bridge, I wouldn't have any ideahow to begin finding this guy.

12:00.738 --> 12:03.613
I mean, these credit cardcompanies
have thousands of employees.

12:03.613 --> 12:06.112
Most of the call centersare in india now.

12:06.394 --> 12:08.332
Well, we could call information.

12:08.332 --> 12:12.441
Okay.
All right, when I gohome, I'll, um...

12:12.441 --> 12:14.238
I'll call the companyand I'll, you know,

12:15.425 --> 12:17.737
we'll try and give mr. Reshmia heads up, okay?

12:17.737 --> 12:18.363
Thanks, daddy.

12:18.363 --> 12:21.550
I think mr. Reshmi will bereally glad you called.

12:24.316 --> 12:25.691
Oh, and daddy,

12:25.691 --> 12:28.160
make sure he knowsthat it's the back door, okay?

12:28.160 --> 12:29.581
Okay.

12:32.300 --> 12:35.488
Manuel devalos,an instinct for justice.

12:36.285 --> 12:39.253
The campaign should
keep the public focusedon mr. Devalos' record.

12:39.347 --> 12:41.988
Minimize anyquestions about
how he achieved it.

12:42.800 --> 12:46.050
You can help us do that,mrs. Dubois, by being

12:46.050 --> 12:48.488
very clearwhen you talk to the media.

12:49.987 --> 12:51.363
When the word "psychic" comesup, you should say that

12:51.363 --> 12:53.597
you've never been comfortablewith that term.

12:53.597 --> 12:55.988
In fact, you don'tconsider yourself psychic.

12:56.300 --> 12:58.816
You've always beenhighly intuitive,

12:58.816 --> 13:03.753
and you've used that "intuition"
to solvea number of cases.

13:03.753 --> 13:05.863
Well, the newspaperswere very definite

13:05.863 --> 13:08.113
about what it was I didfor the district attorney.

13:08.456 --> 13:11.518
You really thinkwe can get away
with pretendingI'm not what I am?

13:11.520 --> 13:13.457
To be blunt, allison,

13:13.457 --> 13:15.675
I don't believe you arewhat you say you are.

13:15.675 --> 13:17.175
Not exactly.

13:17.175 --> 13:19.300
Now, that's not to saythat I think you're a fraud...

13:20.457 --> 13:23.237
but if I were to accept
everythingI hear about you,

13:23.487 --> 13:25.316
well, that would make mequestion

13:26.050 --> 13:28.999
too many of my dearly heldassumptions about the world.

13:29.722 --> 13:32.425
And the last thing we wantto do is make people
question theirassumptions.

13:32.488 --> 13:35.988
So, we're tryingto find language

13:35.988 --> 13:39.816
that fits what you dointo the way most people think.

13:41.175 --> 13:46.191
People like the word"intuitive."
They're comfortable with it.

13:48.300 --> 13:49.363
I'm comfortable with it.

13:49.363 --> 13:53.550
To me, it describessomeone who might
use unconventional techniques...

13:53.550 --> 13:56.737
in your case, someone who mightmake leaps in logic

13:56.737 --> 13:58.999
that might elude otherinvestigators.

13:59.425 --> 14:05.378
Occasionally, one of thoseleaps in logic
might come to you in a dream.

14:06.050 --> 14:08.175
Is that a pretty fairdescription of what you do?

14:08.237 --> 14:09.925
Actually, that'san excellent description.

14:09.925 --> 14:11.691
And I don'thave a problemwith it, either.

14:12.800 --> 14:14.597
That, to me, sounds like someone

14:14.597 --> 14:16.878
I would want to haveworking for the good guys.

14:21.175 --> 14:22.753
Good.

14:34.300 --> 14:37.691
man: I'm surrendering!
I'm surrendering!

14:39.285 --> 14:40.878
my name's jed garrity.

14:40.878 --> 14:43.175
I'm a captain in the 101st
infantry unit.

14:43.175 --> 14:45.050
I expect allrights due to me...

14:54.800 --> 14:55.800
allison,  are you all right?

14:57.237 --> 14:58.315
I'm fine.

14:58.315 --> 15:00.190
Sorry, sir, did you saysomething to me?

15:00.284 --> 15:02.441
Garrity:I did.
I said I think we accomplished

15:02.441 --> 15:04.675
a great deal here this morning,don't you?

15:06.113 --> 15:07.175
Definitely.

15:15.175 --> 15:17.113
I wanted to thank youfor making me 86

15:17.113 --> 15:18.643
those wanted postersdepicting our own

15:18.643 --> 15:21.378
senator garrityas a murder suspect.

15:21.737 --> 15:23.941
We got a dna match for the body.

15:24.738 --> 15:26.190
I assume this guydoesn't look familiar.

15:30.800 --> 15:33.612
No, he does not.
This is the murder victim?

15:34.191 --> 15:35.613
Turns outhe's from corpus christi.

15:35.613 --> 15:37.316
Name is gordon laroche.

15:37.612 --> 15:39.628
And seeing
as he was 59instead of 20 like

15:39.628 --> 15:41.503
the guy you dreamed about,I figured that

15:41.503 --> 15:43.613
maybe you were wrongabout everything.

15:43.613 --> 15:44.800
Well, I guess I was.

15:45.925 --> 15:49.237
This guy laroche must've had
the same tattoo as theman I dreamt about.

15:50.050 --> 15:53.487
Well, this is great news.
Thank you.

15:53.487 --> 15:56.550
Okay, so I never reached outto mr. Reshmi.

15:57.237 --> 15:59.237
Would you have spentthe afternoon dialing india?

15:59.347 --> 16:01.999
No, probably not, but I wouldn'thave told our daughter

16:01.999 --> 16:03.441
I was going to do itin the first place.

16:03.441 --> 16:06.347
Well, I'm pretty
sure this falls underthe category of white lie.

16:07.925 --> 16:12.737
As far as she's concerned,mr. Reshmi is buying a lock
for his back door right now.

16:13.316 --> 16:14.363
And I'm fine with that.

16:17.253 --> 16:18.487
What?

16:18.487 --> 16:21.050
Nothing.You're proably right.
She'll probably never know.

16:21.737 --> 16:24.362
Unless, of course, she hasanother dream about him.

16:25.112 --> 16:27.862
And if she does and she sees hisapartment's been broken into,

16:27.862 --> 16:30.862
well, then she'll be positiveher father lied to her.

16:31.488 --> 16:33.878
I'm not sure that ournine year old is really clear

16:33.878 --> 16:36.738
on the difference betweena white lie and a regular one.

16:41.175 --> 16:42.675
I guess I'm calling india.

16:58.378 --> 17:00.300
looks like the welcome committeegot to you.

17:01.925 --> 17:03.300
You got a name,soldier?

17:04.315 --> 17:05.175
Jed garrity.

17:07.144 --> 17:08.300
I'm a captain.

17:14.925 --> 17:16.738
Welcome to hell,captain garrity.

17:17.112 --> 17:18.487
I'm from corpus christi.

17:19.237 --> 17:20.362
The name's laroche.

17:21.550 --> 17:22.862
Gordon laroche.

17:29.362 --> 17:32.488
Senator garrityand gordon laroche
knew each other.

17:33.175 --> 17:35.440
They spent four years in aprisoner of war camp together.

17:35.440 --> 17:39.363
They even marched side by side
in a memorial day paradein 2002.

17:39.363 --> 17:41.362
I can prove it:I found this
on the internetthis morning.

17:42.300 --> 17:44.816
There isa connectionbetween these two men.

17:45.237 --> 17:46.175
I know.

17:46.269 --> 17:48.550
I found outthey knew each other yesterday.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.675
Turns out laroche hadquite the gambling problem.

17:52.925 --> 17:54.987
Owed moneyto bookies in four states.

17:55.378 --> 17:56.550
I looked at his bankstatements yesterday--

17:56.550 --> 17:58.472
even when larochewasn't working,

17:58.472 --> 18:00.738
he still had chunks of moneycoming in every so often.

18:00.738 --> 18:02.409
$8,500 here, ten grand there.

18:03.175 --> 18:05.800
A lot of that money camein the form of personal checks
from jed garrity.

18:07.113 --> 18:07.706
As a matter of fact,

18:07.706 --> 18:10.331
he sent larochea check for 15 grand
just last christmas.

18:11.987 --> 18:13.425
So you thinkingwhat I'm thinking?

18:14.050 --> 18:14.862
What's that?

18:15.456 --> 18:16.050
Isn't it obvious?

18:17.128 --> 18:19.378
Garrity was making down paymentson laroche's limbs.

18:19.378 --> 18:20.550
It's kind of an expensivemeal, but, hey,

18:20.550 --> 18:22.550
when you've got a ravenousappetite for human flesh,

18:22.550 --> 18:25.050
I guess you have to expectto pay through the nose.

18:26.050 --> 18:27.690
(Laughs)great, it's comedy.

18:27.690 --> 18:30.440
It's cop comedy,the best kind.
What do you want, allison?

18:30.440 --> 18:32.815
It looks to melike every so often
senator garrity would

18:32.815 --> 18:34.331
try to bail his old warbuddy out of trouble.

18:34.331 --> 18:36.175
Should I send a squad carover to his place?

18:36.175 --> 18:37.409
Charge himwith being a nice guy?

18:37.409 --> 18:39.300
You don't thinkit's a strange coincidence?

18:39.363 --> 18:43.128
Laroche turns up murderedin garrity'sometown?

18:43.128 --> 18:43.863
Not really.

18:43.863 --> 18:45.737
Especially sincelaroche owed money

18:45.737 --> 18:47.613
to at least two loan sharksin phoenix.

18:48.519 --> 18:49.800
Tell you what.

18:50.456 --> 18:52.112
I'm going to spend my morningworking the whole

18:52.112 --> 18:53.816
"shady guys larocheowed money to" thing.

18:53.816 --> 18:55.425
I might even follow upon the fact that,

18:55.425 --> 18:56.863
at 10:00 on the nighthe was killed,

18:56.863 --> 19:00.050
laroche's hotel manager
saw him get intothe passenger side

19:00.050 --> 19:01.863
of a silver sedan and drive off.

19:02.862 --> 19:04.613
But, hey, if you want to,uh, pursue your

19:04.613 --> 19:07.269
"senator cannibal" theory,by all means,

19:07.269 --> 19:10.050
feel free.Be sure and let me
know if anything breaks.

19:17.237 --> 19:17.956
Garrity:Allison?

19:19.175 --> 19:20.269
Hello.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.565
Are you headed upto manny's office?

19:22.565 --> 19:24.863
Yeah, I am.
Are you leaving?

19:24.863 --> 19:27.050
I thought you two were workingtogether this morning.

19:27.050 --> 19:28.988
We were, but ihad to reschedule.

19:28.988 --> 19:30.050
A friend of mine died.

19:30.487 --> 19:33.128
I've got to fly out to texas
 pay my respectsto his family.

19:33.363 --> 19:34.738
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

19:34.738 --> 19:35.628
Were you close?

19:36.128 --> 19:37.565
Once upon a time.

19:38.237 --> 19:39.300
We were in the service together.

19:40.863 --> 19:42.503
Well, I have to admit, sir,

19:42.503 --> 19:44.175
I know a little bitabout your background.

19:44.175 --> 19:45.878
About the thingsthat you've lived through.

19:46.690 --> 19:49.988
I imagine that the bonds thatyou develop
during war are very strong.

19:49.988 --> 19:51.237
You have my condolences.

19:52.112 --> 19:53.238
That's very kind of you.

19:53.565 --> 19:56.425
But the truth is,I've been out of touch
with gordon for, oh...

19:58.112 --> 19:59.612
it must be almost 15 years now.

20:00.113 --> 20:02.175
Really? You didn't haveany contact at all?

20:03.394 --> 20:06.175
I'd think that people who sharedthose kinds of experiences

20:06.175 --> 20:08.988
would keep in touch.

20:10.050 --> 20:12.315
Unfortunately, my friend and i
became very different people.

20:14.175 --> 20:15.159
We just drifted apart.

20:17.863 --> 20:19.363
gordon and I saweach other at a funeral.

20:19.363 --> 20:22.800
Must've been,oh, '91 or so.

20:23.550 --> 20:25.675
We haven't evenspoken since then.

20:27.972 --> 20:30.410
Allison, are you all right?
You look a little pale.

20:31.612 --> 20:32.753
I'm fine, sir.

20:44.238 --> 20:46.300
Suprabhaat, ubient credit,
bangalore.

20:46.300 --> 20:47.738
Hi. Do you speak english?

20:48.284 --> 20:50.050
Yes, sir.
How can I help you?

20:50.253 --> 20:53.550
Hi, I'm looking for an employeeof ubient credit.

20:53.737 --> 20:56.300
I don't have a first name,but his last name is reshmi.

20:57.284 --> 20:59.738
Your office in bombay said thatthey thought that

20:59.738 --> 21:00.738
he might work at this branch.

21:01.175 --> 21:02.691
That's right, sir.
Maneck reshmi.

21:02.691 --> 21:05.050
Let me see if he's started
his shift.

21:10.863 --> 21:11.987
Hello, this is mr. Reshmi.

21:13.316 --> 21:15.999
Hello, mr. Reshmi.

21:16.253 --> 21:18.999
My name is joe dubois.
I live in phoenix, arizona.

21:19.471 --> 21:21.160
Uh, you may recallyou had a conversation

21:21.160 --> 21:24.315
with my daughter the other day.
Uh, she's nine.

21:24.815 --> 21:27.768
You spoke of all the interestingplaces that you get to call.

21:28.612 --> 21:30.999
Yes, sir.
I... think I remember.

21:31.675 --> 21:32.999
How can I help you?

21:32.999 --> 21:34.362
Would you like
to arrange a payment?

21:34.362 --> 21:37.331
No, no, actually,uh, I am, uh...

21:38.284 --> 21:43.378
I'm callingto talk to you about...
home security.

21:43.378 --> 21:44.738
I don't think I understand.

21:47.800 --> 21:51.113
I'm calling to ask youto buy a lock
for your back door.

21:51.347 --> 21:53.425
Uh, you know,the kind that-that, uh...

21:53.425 --> 21:55.753
that makes it impossibleto slide open?

21:57.999 --> 21:59.113
you know whatI'm talking about, right?

21:59.113 --> 22:01.175
You-you have a sliding door?

22:01.175 --> 22:02.378
I do.

22:02.613 --> 22:05.972
And you're calling me because
you'd like meto buy a lock for it?

22:06.238 --> 22:07.691
That's right, I would.

22:08.394 --> 22:10.503
Uh, I know this sounds, uh, odd.

22:10.503 --> 22:11.925
I'm afraidI don't understand, sir.

22:12.363 --> 22:13.940
Are you tryingto sell me a product?

22:14.409 --> 22:18.190
No, uh, I just want youto tell me
that you're going to buy a lock.

22:20.425 --> 22:22.238
I'll tell you what.
I'll pay for it.

22:22.612 --> 22:23.363
Okay?

22:23.425 --> 22:26.737
Uh, those locks are cheap,right?

22:26.737 --> 22:29.316
What, uh, what,about... about $25?

22:29.316 --> 22:31.112
I'll send you a personal check.

22:31.565 --> 22:32.988
If you are going
to send a check,

22:32.988 --> 22:34.999
why don't you let me credit it
to your account?

22:35.206 --> 22:36.315
No, no, no, no, no.

22:36.315 --> 22:38.191
No, it's for the lock.
You got to buy the lock.

22:38.191 --> 22:40.999
Uh, I'm still confused,
mr. Dubois.

22:41.363 --> 22:43.425
Why exactly are you so concerned
with my home security?

22:44.050 --> 22:46.503
Uh, look, it's, uh...

22:47.441 --> 22:49.050
it's my daughter.

22:49.999 --> 22:52.862
Um... my daughter liked you.

22:55.675 --> 22:57.831
actually, she's worriedabout you,

22:57.831 --> 23:02.425
and-and... I promised
that I would try
to get ahold of you.

23:04.253 --> 23:06.175
So what do you say, huh?

23:06.410 --> 23:09.440
It's not every day
that a strangerfrom another continent offers

23:09.440 --> 23:11.096
to buy you a free lock.

23:16.737 --> 23:18.425
so, you sent hima check anyway?

23:18.425 --> 23:20.831
Yeah, I sent hima check anyway.

23:21.222 --> 23:24.784
You know, I thinkI need to talk to devalos
to warn him about garrity.

23:25.550 --> 23:27.050
Warn him about what exactly?

23:27.050 --> 23:30.441
I don't know.
All of it-- the things I'vebeen seeing in my dreams.

23:30.441 --> 23:32.597
Two days from now,

23:32.597 --> 23:34.487
devalos is supposedto stand shoulder-to-shoulder

23:34.487 --> 23:37.050
with garrity in frontof every reporter in phoenix.

23:37.472 --> 23:38.999
Can you imaginewhat would happen

23:38.999 --> 23:42.128
if garrity becomes a suspectin a murder investigation?

23:42.128 --> 23:44.675
It would be the endof devalos's political career.

23:45.300 --> 23:48.999
Well, maybe,but there's nothing
that indicates garrity'sgoing to become a suspect.

23:48.999 --> 23:50.175
What about this?

23:50.565 --> 23:51.487
The night of the murder,

23:51.487 --> 23:53.238
someone picked up larochefrom his hotel

23:53.238 --> 23:54.550
in a silver sedan.

23:54.550 --> 23:56.175
Garrity drives a silver sedan.

23:57.050 --> 23:59.300
That's not exactlya smoking gun.

23:59.425 --> 24:01.472
Every malein the developed world

24:01.472 --> 24:03.628
has owned a silver sedanat some point in his life.

24:04.378 --> 24:06.191
Uh, that's pretty muchwhat scanlon said to me

24:06.191 --> 24:07.503
when I called himthis afternoon.

24:11.112 --> 24:12.378
All right, then whydo I keep seeing things

24:12.378 --> 24:14.581
that tell methat garrity's a bad guy?

24:14.581 --> 24:17.690
Why did he look me straightin the face and lie to me?

24:18.425 --> 24:21.128
He told me he hadn't beenin touch with laroche for years.

24:22.300 --> 24:25.925
He sent him $15,000last christmas.

24:25.925 --> 24:27.987
The two of them were in a paradeless than five years ago.

24:28.238 --> 24:29.999
What is he trying to hide?

24:42.737 --> 24:44.690
rhoades has dysentery.

24:44.988 --> 24:46.113
He's dying.

24:52.925 --> 24:54.394
He's not going tolast more than a week.

24:55.487 --> 24:56.988
Now, we can just let it happen,

24:58.238 --> 24:59.362
and who knowshow many of us are going

24:59.362 --> 25:01.300
to starve to deathbefore he dies.

25:03.534 --> 25:05.300
or his death can mean something.

25:07.050 --> 25:08.519
It can help us live.

25:10.253 --> 25:11.999
What are you talking about,captain garrity?

25:13.143 --> 25:16.675
If rhoades dies,how does that help us live?

25:16.675 --> 25:18.800
Are you sayingwhat I think you're saying?

25:18.800 --> 25:19.925
We don't have any food.

25:21.738 --> 25:23.362
Rhoades is dying anyway,so we just...

25:26.300 --> 25:27.675
...help him along.

25:29.394 --> 25:30.050
Then we get to live.

25:32.378 --> 25:34.488
Man:No.
No way.

25:34.488 --> 25:35.863
I can't do that.

25:35.863 --> 25:38.831
We all have to be in on this.
We all have to agree.

25:39.863 --> 25:41.238
And we all have to eat.

25:44.800 --> 25:46.300
God, I'm so hungry.

25:50.550 --> 25:51.628
fine.

25:53.300 --> 25:54.925
But which of us is goingto do it?

25:56.362 --> 25:58.097
Who's going to kill rhoades?

26:00.691 --> 26:02.300
We'll draw for it.

26:26.332 --> 26:27.691
Thank god.

26:36.863 --> 26:38.503
two straws left,captain garrity.

26:40.644 --> 26:42.769
Looks likeit's between me and you.

26:44.050 --> 26:45.487
Let's just dothis, laroche.

27:07.847 --> 27:08.862
where am I?

27:11.238 --> 27:15.112
am I home,captain garrity?

27:15.659 --> 27:16.425
Not yet.

27:18.925 --> 27:19.999
but you will be soon.

27:38.050 --> 27:39.394
Let me be sureI understand you.

27:40.363 --> 27:42.550
A young man namedmichael rhoades

27:43.300 --> 27:45.488
died in a vietnameseprisoner-of-war camp

27:45.488 --> 27:46.800
more than 30 years ago,

27:47.425 --> 27:51.565
and it's your beliefthat jed garrity murdered him

27:52.050 --> 27:53.925
then... ate him.

27:53.925 --> 27:55.300
Garrity didn't want to do it.

27:55.300 --> 27:57.628
He was starving to death.
All the prisoners were.

27:57.628 --> 27:59.738
He did it so the rest of themcould survive.

28:00.175 --> 28:01.878
And you think that all of thisis somehow connected

28:01.878 --> 28:04.175
to a murder that occurredfour days ago?

28:04.222 --> 28:06.253
Gordon laroche was in that campwith garrity.

28:06.378 --> 28:10.378
He was in the room
when garrity killedmichael rhoades.

28:10.409 --> 28:12.800
His gambling debtsare out of control.

28:12.800 --> 28:17.175
Senator garritywas giving laroche money,
and lots of it.

28:18.300 --> 28:19.159
What if they wereblackmail payments?

28:20.238 --> 28:22.050
What if laroche said to garrity

28:22.050 --> 28:23.753
he was goingto expose their little secret

28:23.753 --> 28:25.925
if garrity didn't paid him off?

28:26.425 --> 28:27.253
Don't you thinkit's possible

28:27.253 --> 28:31.253
garrity killed larocheto protect himself, his career?

28:31.253 --> 28:32.238
No.

28:32.503 --> 28:34.690
Actually, allison, I don'T.

28:35.987 --> 28:37.941
Even if I were willingto concede that,

28:37.941 --> 28:41.050
many years ago, in some of thedirest circumstances imaginable,

28:41.050 --> 28:43.878
jed garrity did a terrible thingso that he could survive,

28:43.878 --> 28:46.190
I refuse to believethat he had anything to do

28:46.190 --> 28:49.113
with the murderof that man scanlon found
the other night.

28:49.972 --> 28:52.988
This is a man that I've knownfor more than 20 years.

28:53.237 --> 28:55.644
Someone who has been decoratedwith the highest medal

28:55.644 --> 28:57.128
the military has to give.

28:57.659 --> 28:58.816
And if you're goingto come to my house

28:58.816 --> 29:00.675
and accuse him of murder,I need something

29:00.675 --> 29:03.987
more than dreams abouta prisoner of war camp.

29:03.987 --> 29:05.050
There is more.

29:06.191 --> 29:08.519
10:00, the night of the murder,

29:08.519 --> 29:12.363
someone drove larochefrom his hotel
in a silver sedan.

29:12.363 --> 29:13.816
Garrity drives
a silver sedan.

29:16.999 --> 29:19.363
Now, I think I'm going to haveto bring this to scanlon.

29:19.940 --> 29:23.800
And I really thinkyou should distance yourself
from that man before I do.

29:23.800 --> 29:26.441
And you say this all happenedon sunday night?

29:29.738 --> 29:32.737
Senator garrity was with meat 10:00 P.M. On sunday night,

29:32.737 --> 29:34.737
sitting right in this very room,
as a matter of fact.

29:34.737 --> 29:37.488
That was the nighthe came to see me
about running fordistrict attorney.

29:37.566 --> 29:39.613
We sat right here,

29:40.550 --> 29:43.441
drinking whiskey and talkinguntil just before midnight.

29:44.441 --> 29:46.238
I'm sorry to deflate
your theory, allison,

29:46.238 --> 29:49.191
but the silver sedanyou're referring to was parked

29:49.191 --> 29:50.956
in my drivewaythe entire evening.

29:55.050 --> 29:55.550
ariel:Dad?

29:57.222 --> 29:58.706
Do you know some guynamed mr. Reshmi?

29:58.706 --> 30:00.363
He called when I wason the other line.

30:03.050 --> 30:04.863
Thanks. Hello?

30:05.363 --> 30:05.925
Hello, mr. Dubois.

30:05.925 --> 30:07.987
I... I hope I'm not reaching youat a bad time.

30:08.300 --> 30:10.675
Uh, no, no, I can talk
for a couple minutes.
What's up?

30:12.347 --> 30:14.363
Thieves broke into my apartmentlast night.

30:14.363 --> 30:16.050
They came inthrough the back door.

30:16.613 --> 30:18.300
I'm afraid they took everything
they could carry.

30:18.300 --> 30:20.925
They even found a ring I had
been saving for my engagement.

30:22.597 --> 30:23.988
I have to know, mr. Dubois:

30:23.988 --> 30:25.738
How exactly did you think
to advise me to buy a lock

30:25.738 --> 30:27.941
on the very day
I was about to be robbed?

30:29.300 --> 30:31.581
Um, well, uh...

30:34.112 --> 30:36.253
it really has nothingto do with me.

30:36.253 --> 30:38.253
Uh, like I told you,it's my daughter.

30:38.253 --> 30:43.425
Um, she... uh,she worries about people,
and at times, it-it...

30:44.300 --> 30:47.300
seems like she's very...
prescient.

30:48.222 --> 30:49.175
Do you know what I mean by that?

30:49.784 --> 30:51.160
I think I can guess.

30:51.659 --> 30:53.863
Will you please tell her
I appreciate her effortson my behalf?

30:54.456 --> 30:55.363
I will.

30:55.487 --> 30:57.488
I-I wishI had been more convincing.

30:57.488 --> 30:59.175
And I wish
that I had listened to you.

31:00.331 --> 31:01.050
I also thoughtyou'd like to know

31:01.050 --> 31:03.441
that your family's statuswith the company has changed.

31:03.441 --> 31:05.800
Your account was previously
classified as urgent.

31:05.800 --> 31:07.518
Someone was meant
to call your home every day

31:07.518 --> 31:09.113
until we received payment.

31:09.113 --> 31:11.175
Based on the conversations
we had,

31:11.175 --> 31:13.612
I have reclassified your file
as payment pending.

31:13.612 --> 31:16.315
It should be quite some time
before it's reclassified
as urgent.

31:16.315 --> 31:17.999
Perhaps 90 days.

31:18.753 --> 31:20.925
You're telling me
that nobody's going to call usfor three months?

31:21.331 --> 31:22.722
Thatis right, sir.

31:23.362 --> 31:26.175
Wow. Well, I appreciate that.

31:27.050 --> 31:28.613
Um, are you sureyou're comfortable doing that?

31:28.613 --> 31:30.315
It is a large company.

31:30.362 --> 31:31.503
Errors are made.

31:32.534 --> 31:33.675
Good day, mr. Dubois.

31:41.988 --> 31:43.253
uh, bridgettewants to know

31:43.253 --> 31:45.175
if, uh, we can contributea little something

31:45.175 --> 31:47.425
to mr. Reshmi'sengagement ring fund.

31:51.175 --> 31:52.550
I mean, you got tohand it to the girl.

31:53.488 --> 31:54.737
She's reallybuilt a bridge

31:54.737 --> 31:57.815
between the dubois familyand its creditors.

31:57.815 --> 31:59.925
Well, I'm glad one of usis seeing something useful.

32:00.550 --> 32:02.238
You know whatI can't stop thinking about?

32:03.175 --> 32:05.331
Is that poor soldier,michael rhoades.

32:05.331 --> 32:06.300
Just a boy, really.

32:06.300 --> 32:09.113
And he died half a world away.
Al...

32:09.113 --> 32:10.738
it was horrible, and now,

32:10.738 --> 32:13.050
nobody's ever going to knowwhat really happened to him.

32:13.050 --> 32:14.862
Well, maybe that'sa good thing, too.

32:15.316 --> 32:18.675
Even if you could provethat this guy died

32:18.675 --> 32:20.487
at the hands of hisfellow prisoners,

32:20.487 --> 32:23.113
what possibly could begained by exposing it?

32:23.999 --> 32:26.425
I mean, imagine the horrorhis family would feel

32:26.425 --> 32:29.628
if they found outthat this kid was eaten.

32:30.910 --> 32:32.112
And the menwho killed him,

32:32.112 --> 32:33.487
I know that they dida terrible thing,

32:34.488 --> 32:36.999
but they were in akind of living hell.

32:37.456 --> 32:40.722
And it doesn't soundlike they went on
to become career criminals.

32:40.722 --> 32:42.613
I know. You're right,of course your right.

32:45.550 --> 32:46.753
this is whatI keep thinking:

32:47.999 --> 32:51.612
If I can't tell the truthabout michael rhoades,

32:51.612 --> 32:56.472
and if I can'tp the policesolve la roche's murder,

32:57.300 --> 32:59.237
then why am I seeingthese things?

32:59.737 --> 33:02.999
Why do I have such horriblethings stuck in my head?

33:04.612 --> 33:06.050
Man: I don't think I can do this.

33:06.050 --> 33:07.534
 I'm serious-- I can'T.

33:08.832 --> 33:10.113
We've beenover this, evan.

33:10.113 --> 33:11.362
None of us wants to do it.

33:12.238 --> 33:14.112
Gordon's been out of controlfor a long time.

33:14.112 --> 33:15.565
His debts are getting bigger.

33:15.565 --> 33:17.737
He keeps coming to usfor more money.

33:18.050 --> 33:20.456
Now he's threatening to takehis story to the networks.

33:20.456 --> 33:22.999
I know, but you're talkingabout murdering someone.

33:23.612 --> 33:26.050
I haven't held a gun in my handsfor over 30 years.

33:26.050 --> 33:27.550
I'm a doctor now.

33:27.550 --> 33:30.050
We've all built lives forourselves-- that's the point.

33:30.550 --> 33:32.050
If la roche comes outand tells the truth

33:32.050 --> 33:34.738
about what we did to rhoades,that's it-- we're ruined.

33:35.613 --> 33:37.378
I didn't fly out hereto have a debate.

33:38.988 --> 33:39.847
Draw.

33:49.550 --> 33:50.612
Sorry, evan.

33:51.425 --> 33:54.550
Look, I know we needto do this...

33:54.550 --> 33:56.862
correction: Youneed to do this.

33:56.862 --> 33:58.628
Why should I bethe only one at risk?

34:01.769 --> 34:03.378
We'll all do it.

34:04.488 --> 34:05.050
Together.

34:07.800 --> 34:12.268
If everybody takes part...then no one can back out later.

34:13.300 --> 34:15.503
No one can becomeanother laroche.

34:16.237 --> 34:18.612
We can't blackmaileach other
or threaten to goto the authorities.

34:18.612 --> 34:20.800
Because we'll allbe murderers.

34:22.128 --> 34:24.565
Each one of us will be justas guilty as everybody else.

34:25.237 --> 34:28.237
It's the way we should've donethis in the first place.

34:28.440 --> 34:29.987
If we all did rhoades together,

34:29.987 --> 34:31.268
then laroche would've hadhis own skin in the game,

34:31.268 --> 34:34.175
and we wouldn't be havingthis conversation right now.

34:37.893 --> 34:38.550
Tomorrow night.

34:39.987 --> 34:43.206
Evan, you tell laroche you needto talk to him.

34:43.206 --> 34:44.800
He can come to your housefor a drink.

34:45.737 --> 34:47.565
Put some sleeping pillsin his whiskey.

34:48.862 --> 34:50.425
We'll all come over later.

34:51.050 --> 34:52.315
Midnight.

34:53.175 --> 34:55.393
We'll kill him together.

34:56.987 --> 34:58.862
And then each of us will get ridof a piece of him.

35:00.737 --> 35:02.999
Evan, you have to burywhat's left of him.

35:03.879 --> 35:05.112
Do you thinkyou can handle that?

35:11.456 --> 35:12.863
Now let me askyou something.

35:13.999 --> 35:15.582
Do you own a chainsaw?

35:22.331 --> 35:23.425
Scanlon:Evan sabow?

35:23.425 --> 35:25.300
Yes?

35:26.050 --> 35:27.175
My name's lee scanlon.

35:27.175 --> 35:28.519
I'm with the phoenixpolice department.

35:29.237 --> 35:30.800
I have few questionsfor you about, uh,

35:31.488 --> 35:33.050
about the murderof gordon laroche.

35:34.862 --> 35:35.550
You knew him, right?

35:36.550 --> 35:39.113
Of course.Gordon and I go way back.

35:39.113 --> 35:40.488
We were in the army together.

35:41.222 --> 35:43.425
Did you happen to see himthis past sunday?

35:43.425 --> 35:46.191
Sunday?I don't think so; no.

35:46.972 --> 35:48.925
You sure? Can you rememberwhere you were that night?

35:49.706 --> 35:51.675
I was here.I was home all night.

35:52.425 --> 35:55.816
Are you asking me to accountfor my whereabouts, detective?

35:56.425 --> 35:59.862
Hope you're not implying
I had anything to dowith gordon's death.

36:00.050 --> 36:01.050
Nah, I'm just checking.

36:02.878 --> 36:06.675
Can anybody confirm that youwere here-- wife, kids?

36:06.675 --> 36:08.628
No, I'm divorced.

36:08.628 --> 36:11.999
I was watching televisionall night, by myself.

36:15.613 --> 36:17.425
I like that tattoo.

36:19.956 --> 36:21.753
Gordon laroche hadone just like it.

36:22.644 --> 36:24.893
Yeah, I know.We, uh, we got 'em together.

36:25.363 --> 36:29.050
A group of guys from our unitgot drunk one night

36:29.050 --> 36:30.237
when we were on leave;

36:30.910 --> 36:32.815
we all had thesewhen we woke up.

36:33.687 --> 36:35.472
Wish to god that we hadn'T.

36:37.050 --> 36:39.113
We were justunchof stupid kids.

36:43.175 --> 36:44.144
What's in the bag?

36:47.925 --> 36:52.050
Oh, just some tools, old stuffI was going to get rid of.

36:52.565 --> 36:54.050
You mind openingit up for me?

36:55.456 --> 36:57.238
You don't have to.
We could just waithere together

36:57.238 --> 36:59.488
while somebody drivesover a search warrant.

37:12.050 --> 37:13.425
That's a nice-looking chain saw.

37:13.425 --> 37:16.237
You shouldn't keep your toolsall mixed up like that, though.

37:16.784 --> 37:19.550
They're I was going to get rid of them.

37:19.550 --> 37:22.519
Hmm...(sniffs)that smells like bleach.

37:22.519 --> 37:23.425
No wonder you're lookingto dump that thing.

37:23.425 --> 37:26.050
It's not going to last very longif you use bleach to clean it.

37:27.675 --> 37:30.878
I really don't see that that'sany of your business, detective.

37:30.878 --> 37:31.999
Funny thing aboutchain saws, though.

37:32.612 --> 37:34.800
They're almost impossibleto get completely clean.

37:34.800 --> 37:36.238
There's just too manynooks and crannies.

37:37.999 --> 37:40.050
So, dr. Sabow...

37:40.988 --> 37:42.425
if I take a real closelook at that thing, 

37:42.425 --> 37:44.956
you think I'll find some ofgordon laroche's blood on it?

37:50.737 --> 37:51.191
hello?

37:51.363 --> 37:54.706
Evan sabow just confessed
to the murder of gordon laroche.

37:54.706 --> 37:55.987
Lee, that's great.

37:55.987 --> 37:57.816
Have you arrested garrityand the others?

37:57.816 --> 38:00.925
No. And right now, it doesn't
look like we're going to.

38:01.675 --> 38:02.706
What do you mean?Why not?

38:03.285 --> 38:04.191
Sabow confessed but he'ssaying it was all him.

38:05.691 --> 38:08.191
He says he killed larochewithout any help.

38:08.363 --> 38:09.831
Well, that's not right.

38:09.831 --> 38:11.878
Laroche was blackmailingall of them.

38:11.878 --> 38:13.441
All four of them killed him.

38:13.441 --> 38:14.769
Not according to sabow.

38:15.738 --> 38:17.175
He says laroche borrowed moneyfrom him,

38:17.175 --> 38:19.050
the two of them had an argumentabout when laroche was

38:19.050 --> 38:20.800
going to pay him backand it turned physical.

38:20.800 --> 38:23.300
He's lying. He's tryingto protect the others.

38:23.300 --> 38:25.050
I believe you,
but we searched his house.

38:25.050 --> 38:27.487
There's no evidence that tiesanyone else to the murder.

38:27.487 --> 38:28.800
None of the neighborssaw anybody

38:28.800 --> 38:31.722
coming or going from the houseon the night laroche died.

38:31.941 --> 38:34.566
We'll keep working it, but, uh,
it looks like sabow's taking

38:34.566 --> 38:35.999
the truth to jail with him.

38:35.999 --> 38:36.863
So that's it?

38:36.863 --> 38:38.863
So garrity and the rest of themjust get away with it?

38:39.487 --> 38:42.550
I hope not, allison, but at this
point, that's a possibility.

38:42.550 --> 38:45.440
Evan sabow may bea bad murderer, but, uh,

38:45.440 --> 38:47.425
I have to admithe's a good soldier.

38:49.894 --> 38:50.999
senator garrity?

38:51.862 --> 38:53.284
I'd like to talk to youabout gordon laroche.

38:53.284 --> 38:55.550
I'm afraid I don't have timefor a conversation right now.

38:55.550 --> 38:56.378
Senator...

38:56.691 --> 38:58.925
you really shouldn't be here,mrs. Dubois.

38:58.925 --> 39:01.566
I'm sure you're aware that mannyand I have a press conference

39:01.566 --> 39:02.737
starting in just a few minutes.

39:06.113 --> 39:08.675
I would hate for any reportersto see you hanging around.

39:12.488 --> 39:14.050
You don't want to hearabout laroche.

39:14.050 --> 39:17.050
Why don't we talk aboutprivate michael rhoades?

39:21.675 --> 39:23.628
Would you all excuse usa moment?

39:36.800 --> 39:38.643
It's been a long time
since anyone mentionedthat name to me.

39:39.722 --> 39:41.487
I know what happenedin that camp.

39:42.253 --> 39:46.425
I know that gordon laroche wasblackmailing
all of you about it.

39:46.425 --> 39:47.999
And you killed him.

39:49.691 --> 39:52.363
That's quite a story, especiallysince evan sabow just confessed

39:52.363 --> 39:53.612
to gordon's murder.

39:54.440 --> 39:56.925
From what I'm told, they werehavin argument over money.

39:56.925 --> 39:58.800
But we know better, don't we?

39:59.268 --> 40:01.191
And don't think that youand you're friends are

40:01.191 --> 40:02.925
just going to walk awayfrom this.

40:02.925 --> 40:05.362
I am going to find a wayto prove that you did it.

40:06.331 --> 40:07.441
That sounds like a tall order.

40:08.191 --> 40:10.613
The killer's in jail;he freely admits to his crime.

40:12.222 --> 40:14.800
And I must say,I don't understand why a woman

40:14.800 --> 40:18.128
of your obvious talentswould waste her time

40:18.128 --> 40:19.738
on a piece of businesslike this one.

40:20.675 --> 40:22.050
The four of you killed someone.

40:23.831 --> 40:24.706
Fair enough.

40:25.800 --> 40:27.550
But let me make sureI've got your story right.

40:28.175 --> 40:32.378
A long time ago, a soldier died

40:32.378 --> 40:35.999
so that the men he served withcould survive.

40:36.940 --> 40:41.315
My guess is, they were probablyaware of the burden

40:41.315 --> 40:43.941
that the death of michaelrhoades placed on them.

40:44.863 --> 40:47.456
Who knows? Maybe they even madeanonymous contributions

40:47.456 --> 40:49.113
to the family ofthat poor, dead soldier.

40:50.206 --> 40:51.737
Seems like the leastthey could do.

40:52.999 --> 40:54.863
If these men had anykind of decency at all,

40:54.863 --> 40:56.675
it seems to me that theywould live their lives

40:56.675 --> 41:01.737
in a way that honoredthe sacrifice
that made them possible.

41:01.737 --> 41:03.425
Don't expect me to sympathizewith you.

41:03.425 --> 41:04.987
You gave up your rightto understanding

41:04.987 --> 41:06.675
when you murderedgordon laroche.

41:07.862 --> 41:09.440
Right. Gordon laroche.

41:09.440 --> 41:11.050
He's the sticking point here,isn't he?

41:12.253 --> 41:14.394
If you're right aboutany of this,

41:14.394 --> 41:16.269
he's the only one who made itout of that camp

41:16.269 --> 41:18.425
who didn't understand the legacythat rhoades left behind.

41:18.425 --> 41:22.863
The only one who didn't holdhimself to a higher standard.

41:23.738 --> 41:26.300
If fact it sounds like youthink laroche tried to exploit

41:26.300 --> 41:28.566
that terrible timefor his personal gain,

41:29.238 --> 41:31.175
and he tried to drag the restof those survivors down

41:31.425 --> 41:33.925
into the mess he had madefor himself.

41:35.612 --> 41:37.738
Would I be sorry that someonelike that was gone?

41:38.300 --> 41:39.331
Not at all.

41:39.738 --> 41:42.112
He wasn't worthy of the lifeanother man gave him.

41:45.800 --> 41:48.050
Now, if you'll excuse me,allison,

41:48.050 --> 41:50.800
I have to go help put your bossback in office.

41:51.800 --> 41:53.503
A man I happen to believewill do a lot of good.

41:54.550 --> 41:57.488
A man I believe will help you doa lot of good.

41:58.300 --> 42:00.050
And that's all mostof us want, isn't it?

42:01.612 --> 42:04.518
A chance to do something goodwith the time we have.
