00:20.312 --> 00:22.815
<i>For centuries the sacred magic
of the Divine Crystal...</i>

00:22.981 --> 00:25.234
<i>...blessed our world and its people.</i>

00:31.114 --> 00:35.244
<i>But in time the promise of its power
brought war to our lands.</i>

00:41.208 --> 00:46.681
<i>Lucis, a peaceful kingdom of great magic
kept safe by the power of the crystal.</i>

00:48.715 --> 00:52.219
<i>And Niflheim,
a military empire of vast machinery...</i>

00:52.386 --> 00:55.014
<i>...made strong by
the might of its Magitek.</i>

00:55.514 --> 00:58.313
<i>Long has war raged between the two.</i>

01:01.728 --> 01:05.107
<i>As the years passed,
Niflheim marched on nearby nations...</i>

01:05.315 --> 01:07.363
<i>...driven by its unsurpassed technology.</i>

01:10.153 --> 01:14.033
<i>To defend itself,
Lucis raised a magical wall...</i>

01:14.283 --> 01:17.287
<i>...the strength of which comes
from the crystal itself.</i>

01:19.162 --> 01:23.087
<i>Insomnia alone, the crown city
and last bastion of Lucian defence...</i>

01:23.292 --> 01:26.171
<i>...remained beyond Niflheim reach
for many years.</i>

01:29.965 --> 01:31.683
<i>Amid the escalating war...</i>

01:31.842 --> 01:34.311
<i>...Prince Noctis of Lucis
had come to Tenebrae...</i>

01:34.469 --> 01:36.813
<i>...to seek healing for a grievous injury.</i>

01:37.222 --> 01:41.398
<i>He made the long journey
together with his father, King Regis.</i>

01:42.519 --> 01:45.318
<i>Mother, brother, and I,
the royalty of Tenebrae...</i>

01:45.480 --> 01:47.482
<i>...had all welcomed their visit.</i>

02:02.372 --> 02:06.047
<i>It was then that the fires came,
everywhere and all at once.</i>

02:08.211 --> 02:12.557
<i>In a mere instant,
the whole of Tenebrae was ablaze.</i>

02:14.176 --> 02:16.053
<i>Ravus!</i>

02:24.603 --> 02:26.446
Mother!

02:35.906 --> 02:37.704
General Glauca.

02:44.247 --> 02:48.468
<i>The Niflheim attack was an attempt on the
lives of the visiting Lucian royalty.</i>

02:54.091 --> 02:55.968
Noctis!

03:00.639 --> 03:02.607
Please. Help us!

03:02.766 --> 03:04.234
King Regis!

03:18.490 --> 03:19.958
Lunafreya...

03:25.205 --> 03:27.048
Luna!

03:28.291 --> 03:30.168
<i>From that day until this day...</i>

03:30.836 --> 03:33.760
<i>...Tenebrae has been gripped
in the iron fist of Niflheim...</i>

03:34.548 --> 03:36.971
<i>...sworn enemy of Lucis.</i>

03:41.763 --> 03:46.064
<i>King Regis assembles a force of mighty
warriors to combat the imperial menace.</i>

03:46.476 --> 03:50.652
<i>Dubbed the Kingsglaive,
they fight relentlessly against Niflheim...</i>

03:50.814 --> 03:52.908
<i>...empowered by the magic
of their sovereign.</i>

04:07.122 --> 04:08.920
All units, move to secure the Wall.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.709
If they break through, we're done.

04:39.738 --> 04:41.285
What's the hold-up, Crowe?

04:41.782 --> 04:43.784
<i>Crowe! Status?</i>

04:44.159 --> 04:45.160
Almost there.

04:48.246 --> 04:49.247
No!

04:53.919 --> 04:57.514
<i>I need help. East Wall's going down.
Pelna, can you get to me?</i>

04:58.924 --> 05:01.177
Lucis isn't paying us refugees enough...

05:02.219 --> 05:03.311
...for this.

05:19.402 --> 05:20.403
How is this fair?

05:27.285 --> 05:28.912
Nyx, I owe you one.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.167
You and everyone else.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.833
<i>We need support on the east flank.
Nyx, where are you?</i>

05:32.999 --> 05:34.091
I'm on my way.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.549
Pelna, fall back
and regroup with the others.

05:37.587 --> 05:38.930
Go easy on the magic, hero.

05:39.089 --> 05:40.932
You got people
waiting for you back home.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.388
I'm worth the wait.

05:44.886 --> 05:45.887
Show-off.

05:57.649 --> 06:00.573
<i>Watch your back, Libertus.
We got more incoming.</i>

06:01.945 --> 06:03.743
We ain't gonna last much longer.

06:06.741 --> 06:08.163
Crowe!

06:10.287 --> 06:11.288
Yes!

06:17.085 --> 06:20.760
<i>All Glaives, fall back.
Repeat, all Glaives fall back!</i>

07:07.010 --> 07:08.603
Release the daemon.

08:31.261 --> 08:35.061
<i>We can't take down that daemon.
I'm ordering a full retreat.</i>

08:35.932 --> 08:38.525
<i>Get back here alive.
That's an order.</i>

08:39.269 --> 08:40.361
<i>For hearth and home.</i>

08:55.577 --> 08:59.753
<i>All units, fall back to the extraction point.
Support is inbound.</i>

09:03.251 --> 09:05.504
Nyx! We have to get out of here.

09:06.671 --> 09:10.266
- Nyx! We have orders!
- Yeah.

09:10.425 --> 09:11.426
Help!

09:11.593 --> 09:12.594
Nyx!

09:12.886 --> 09:14.183
That idiot.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.777
Nyx!

09:22.145 --> 09:23.897
Crowe. We gotta move.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.066
You gotta be kidding me.

10:00.517 --> 10:02.690
You know I ain't got
the stomach for this crap.

10:04.813 --> 10:05.985
Would you rather walk?

10:06.147 --> 10:08.149
Come on.
Just like Galahd Canyon back home.

10:21.538 --> 10:22.710
Libertus!

10:44.602 --> 10:46.650
Luche, report.

10:48.148 --> 10:51.618
The imperial forces
look to be withdrawing, sir.

11:10.295 --> 11:11.842
Guess I owe you another one.

11:12.589 --> 11:14.216
I'll put it on your tab.

11:14.549 --> 11:16.597
You just try and get some rest, all right?

11:32.775 --> 11:35.028
You disobeyed a direct order to retreat.

11:35.486 --> 11:37.113
For hearth and home, right, sir?

11:38.364 --> 11:42.995
As long as I got strength in my body,
I obey that order.

11:43.745 --> 11:45.964
Don't fool yourself, Nyx Ulric.

11:46.372 --> 11:49.421
Whatever strength you have
is on loan from the king.

11:49.751 --> 11:51.424
You are nothing without him.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.215
Await details of your reassignment.

13:03.408 --> 13:04.455
Yes, Your Majesty.

13:04.659 --> 13:07.037
Despite their victory all but assured.

13:08.871 --> 13:12.045
A sudden and inexplicable retreat.

13:12.583 --> 13:14.802
We are at risk nonetheless, Your Majesty.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.764
We cannot know
when they will strike again.

13:18.214 --> 13:20.592
Your Majesty, word from the West Gate.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.644
A man claiming to be an envoy
of the empire requests an audience.

13:27.765 --> 13:31.565
The envoy from Niflheim awaits without,
Your Majesty.

13:36.691 --> 13:37.908
Hello there.

13:38.776 --> 13:40.198
Hello!

13:40.361 --> 13:41.613
Good day to you...

13:42.196 --> 13:43.197
...and you.

13:44.407 --> 13:46.375
Well met, my dear Lucians.

13:46.576 --> 13:49.329
Has Niflheim grown so bold...

13:49.537 --> 13:52.791
...that they send the chancellor himself
as envoy?

13:53.166 --> 13:55.294
And under no guard, at that?

13:55.460 --> 13:59.510
It is an honour to be recognised
by the great King Regis.

13:59.714 --> 14:04.436
Yet permit me to stand on ceremony
and introduce myself nonetheless.

14:05.303 --> 14:09.479
Ardyn Izunia, Chancellor of Niflheim...

14:10.892 --> 14:13.520
...at your humble service.

14:13.895 --> 14:15.772
And I come to you on this...

14:15.980 --> 14:20.451
...most auspicious of days
to offer terms of peace.

14:21.319 --> 14:22.411
Peace?

14:22.862 --> 14:25.035
As you no doubt surmised...

14:25.198 --> 14:29.669
...that recent manoeuvre of ours
was no strategic retreat.

14:30.453 --> 14:32.046
Call it...

14:33.039 --> 14:36.009
...a gesture of imperial goodwill.

14:36.751 --> 14:38.970
Like you, we wish nothing more...

14:39.128 --> 14:43.884
...than to bring a swift end
to this senseless war.

14:44.634 --> 14:45.977
Is that so?

14:46.177 --> 14:47.178
It is, indeed.

14:47.345 --> 14:50.565
And we require
but a singular compliance.

14:50.890 --> 14:55.066
Save your grand Insomnia here.

14:55.269 --> 15:00.776
Lucis must forfeit
all territories to Niflheim rule.

15:04.195 --> 15:05.538
Insomnia!

15:05.696 --> 15:09.451
The jewel in the crown
of the Lucian kingdom.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.412
How foolish of me to forget.

15:12.620 --> 15:15.794
There is just one more trivial thing.

15:16.999 --> 15:18.342
It concerns your son.

15:20.628 --> 15:23.472
The fetching Prince Noctis of Lucis...

15:23.673 --> 15:27.348
...and the fair Princess Lunafreya
of Tenebrae...

15:28.845 --> 15:30.722
They are to be wed.

15:32.181 --> 15:34.400
You seem vexed, Your Highness.

15:35.226 --> 15:40.904
I assure you, the princess
still holds you in the highest regard...

15:41.065 --> 15:44.444
...as she has done
all these 12 long years.

16:01.419 --> 16:02.688
Don't know if anyone's told you...

16:02.712 --> 16:05.465
...but we don't take kindly
to insubordination around here.

16:09.010 --> 16:12.105
Do yourself a favour, take a look around.

16:12.638 --> 16:17.189
This is what a hundred years of peace
looks like.

16:19.896 --> 16:25.653
It's a lasting peace made by the Wall
and the Wall alone.

16:27.987 --> 16:31.787
See, we don't need any of you
immigrants...

16:32.158 --> 16:36.413
...jumping around, playing war hero.

17:09.694 --> 17:12.493
Hey!
Rough day on the gate, huh, Glaive?

17:13.115 --> 17:15.538
You jerk.
It's your fault he got stuck there.

17:17.411 --> 17:21.632
- Not a very nice welcome for a big hero.
- Not a very nice outfit for one, either.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.417
I think it brings out my eyes.

17:26.963 --> 17:28.180
What'd you put in this?

17:28.339 --> 17:29.682
Tastes like a chocobo turd.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.057
Hey, Shut your trap!

17:31.592 --> 17:34.345
This ain't Galahd.
That's the way folks around here like it.

17:34.512 --> 17:39.359
Oh, well. I'm glad to see you're willing to
sell out our heritage for a few extra gil.

17:39.934 --> 17:42.653
Hey, Libertus.
You thank Nyx for saving your life yet?

17:42.812 --> 17:45.986
Oh, come on, Crowe.
Nyx and I are too close for that.

17:46.148 --> 17:48.776
He helps me, I help him.
That's the way it's always been.

17:48.943 --> 17:51.492
Looks like you got a little help
from something else, huh?

17:51.654 --> 17:53.201
I need all I can get.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.408
For hearth!

17:56.742 --> 17:57.789
- And home.
- And home.

18:00.288 --> 18:04.384
So, Nyx the Gatekeeper.
How's the new post treating you?

18:04.584 --> 18:06.586
Oh, it's amazing.
You guys would love it.

18:06.836 --> 18:08.759
The gate watch are real sweethearts.

18:09.547 --> 18:10.673
Yeah, right.

18:10.840 --> 18:13.434
We all know they hate us outsiders
more than anything.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.766
So bored they got nothing better to do.

18:16.012 --> 18:17.480
Boredom's not so bad.

18:17.638 --> 18:19.015
Means there's peace, at least.

18:19.265 --> 18:22.109
I'd fight a hundred more wars
for Galahdans to know boredom.

18:22.768 --> 18:23.985
Fight all you want.

18:24.145 --> 18:25.488
Just don't go dying yet.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.280
I still owe you.

18:27.857 --> 18:28.858
A lot.

18:29.066 --> 18:31.660
Where would the Glaive be
without its hero?

18:31.819 --> 18:34.572
Can you not talk like this
while we're drinking, please?

18:34.739 --> 18:37.913
We just sent the Niffs running
with tails between their legs, right?

18:38.075 --> 18:40.828
They weren't running from us.
No, they were toying with us.

18:42.747 --> 18:46.251
Stop being such a buzzkill, Luche.
We all know what happened.

18:46.500 --> 18:49.174
Did you know they sent an envoy
to the Citadel after that?

18:49.337 --> 18:51.840
What for? To offer their surrender?

18:52.006 --> 18:53.349
- More like demand ours.
- What?

18:53.507 --> 18:55.509
Demand? My ass!

18:55.926 --> 18:57.519
No? Think about it.

18:57.928 --> 18:59.851
The empire's got Lucis on its last legs.

19:00.014 --> 19:02.142
It's the perfect time to make demands.

19:03.893 --> 19:06.863
We are losing this war, Your Majesty.

19:07.396 --> 19:10.445
Lucis cannot rely
on the Kingsglaive alone.

19:10.608 --> 19:13.737
Accepting the truce may be
our best course of action.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.451
You speak of matters
beyond the New Wall.

19:16.781 --> 19:20.456
We have no need of a truce here,
so long as it stands.

19:20.868 --> 19:25.089
And if our position worsens,
we still have the Old Wall.

19:25.289 --> 19:30.295
Yes, but this truce
will end the fighting altogether.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.514
If only we could compromise...

19:33.673 --> 19:35.596
Compromise is unwise.

19:35.758 --> 19:38.602
We know nothing
of Niflheim's true intentions.

19:39.303 --> 19:42.978
Do not fool yourselves.
The Walls are far from impenetrable.

19:43.391 --> 19:46.440
The paths left to us are few.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.818
The New Wall draws its power
from the throne.

19:50.064 --> 19:54.865
I am able to sustain it for some years yet,
if the kingdom requires it.

19:56.153 --> 20:01.125
But the chancellor spoke one truth,
if only one.

20:02.034 --> 20:05.254
We are old, and the Old Wall...

20:06.747 --> 20:10.502
I cannot command the Old Wall
with a weakened hand...

20:10.918 --> 20:15.094
...nor do I have the strength to muster
an offensive to turn the tide on this war.

20:15.673 --> 20:18.017
Then let the choice be made,
Your Majesty.

20:18.968 --> 20:21.062
What are we to protect?

20:44.201 --> 20:45.498
<i>Help Mother!</i>

21:04.388 --> 21:07.187
How come you never
lose your lunch like that?

21:09.018 --> 21:10.065
Just doesn't add up.

21:10.352 --> 21:13.526
Here's this ancient art,
secret of the royal family and all that.

21:14.064 --> 21:16.066
Libertus! Nyx!

21:16.942 --> 21:18.615
Come here, guys, you gotta see this.

21:19.820 --> 21:21.500
<i>Things were hectic in the capital today...</i>

21:21.530 --> 21:23.425
<i>...as the Lucian government
announced full acceptance...</i>

21:23.449 --> 21:26.293
<i>...of what some are criticising
as the unilateral peace terms...</i>

21:26.452 --> 21:28.500
<i>...proposed by Chancellor Izunia
of Niflheim.</i>

21:28.704 --> 21:31.958
<i>The signing of the truce will see
power over all Lucian territories...</i>

21:32.124 --> 21:35.378
<i>...transferred to the empire,
with the sole exception of Insomnia.</i>

21:35.544 --> 21:39.924
<i>In return, Niflheim guarantees
the safety of Insomnia and its citizenry...</i>

21:40.132 --> 21:42.305
<i>...as well as a cessation
to all hostilities...</i>

21:42.468 --> 21:45.392
<i>...bringing a decisive end
to this long and bitter war.</i>

21:48.265 --> 21:53.021
All that fighting we did.
All for nothing.

21:53.771 --> 21:57.150
Glaives.
Assemble in the briefing room.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.572
Now.

22:06.283 --> 22:09.082
The king has spoken,
and you have heard.

22:09.620 --> 22:12.794
All lands beyond the Wall
are to be relinquished to the empire.

22:12.998 --> 22:14.875
Will no regions be spared?

22:15.501 --> 22:17.879
- None.
- But your home's out there too!

22:18.254 --> 22:19.255
It is.

22:19.463 --> 22:21.090
Why would the king do this?

22:21.465 --> 22:23.058
Because it'll end this damn war.

22:25.302 --> 22:26.599
- Crowe.
- Sir!

22:27.263 --> 22:30.938
Prepare to deploy.
You're being sent to infiltrate Tenebrae.

22:31.517 --> 22:32.609
Tenebrae, sir?

22:33.352 --> 22:35.275
Mission details are classified.

22:35.688 --> 22:38.032
Report to my office for briefing
in 30 minutes.

22:39.233 --> 22:40.610
And, Nyx...

22:41.277 --> 22:42.574
You're off the West Gate.

22:42.903 --> 22:45.497
You've been reassigned
to the castle guard.

22:46.490 --> 22:47.742
That is all.

22:54.748 --> 22:58.048
So this is what you were
talking about, Luche?

22:58.252 --> 22:59.299
You heard the captain.

22:59.461 --> 23:02.635
- This wasn't our decision to make.
- Not ours to make?

23:02.840 --> 23:05.389
Those are our homes out there!
Our people!

23:05.634 --> 23:08.012
You're just gonna go along
and abandon them?

23:08.178 --> 23:09.725
If we don't go along with them...

23:09.889 --> 23:12.142
...the empire will unleash all hell
on Insomnia.

23:12.308 --> 23:14.686
- We'll unleash it right back at them!
- Easy, easy.

23:14.852 --> 23:16.069
He's not the enemy.

23:16.270 --> 23:17.772
Don't you get it?

23:19.565 --> 23:21.192
We're nothing to them.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.950
Rats, snuck in from beyond the Wall.

23:25.988 --> 23:27.831
Sure, they had a use for us...

23:27.990 --> 23:30.163
...when they realised
we could work their magic.

23:30.326 --> 23:33.079
So they handpicked us
from all the other rats out there...

23:33.245 --> 23:38.046
...and just let us nibble away
at his royal majesty's precious power.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.795
But as soon as this war's all over...

23:41.128 --> 23:43.381
...it's back to the sewers for all of us.

23:44.298 --> 23:47.472
That means you too, hero.

23:47.676 --> 23:53.433
You missing home so much, Libertus,
why don't you and Nyx head on back?

23:53.599 --> 23:56.022
I'm sure Niflheim will welcome you
with open arms.

23:56.310 --> 23:58.233
You've got a home out there too.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.862
Or did you forget?

24:10.824 --> 24:12.121
Damn it!

24:12.952 --> 24:14.875
I'm not gonna let it end like this.

24:21.168 --> 24:24.263
It is said sentiment amongst the people
is favourable, Your Majesty.

24:24.421 --> 24:26.674
Most all will welcome this peace.

24:26.882 --> 24:28.568
If you yourself
have not heard their voices...

24:28.592 --> 24:30.970
...how can you claim
to know their hearts?

24:31.762 --> 24:34.060
What of the mission to Tenebrae,
Your Majesty?

24:34.348 --> 24:36.521
Is such clandestine action wise?

24:36.809 --> 24:39.608
If discovered, it will only serve
to provoke the empire.

24:39.770 --> 24:42.944
The empire remains our enemy
until the treaty is signed.

24:43.190 --> 24:44.692
So long as we are at war...

24:44.858 --> 24:47.907
...His Majesty intends to remain
one step ahead of them.

24:48.362 --> 24:49.488
Of course.

25:00.666 --> 25:03.510
A hairpin? I didn't think you were
into that kind of thing.

25:03.711 --> 25:06.464
It's not for me.
It's a gift for the princess.

25:06.714 --> 25:08.967
But keep that quiet.
Nobody's supposed to know.

25:11.969 --> 25:13.312
Well, that's me.

25:14.346 --> 25:15.723
Watch your back out there.

25:16.432 --> 25:19.185
I know you're sick of hearing it,
but you're like a little...

25:19.351 --> 25:22.821
Little sister to you.
Yeah, I am sick of hearing it.

25:25.566 --> 25:28.160
Just make sure you come back
in one piece, all right?

25:32.114 --> 25:33.411
Says the guy in two pieces.

25:56.180 --> 25:58.899
Lady Lunafreya,
I have left the rear gate open.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.059
Thank you.

26:03.145 --> 26:04.192
Must you go?

26:04.354 --> 26:05.355
Yes.

26:07.941 --> 26:09.534
Then go quickly.

26:14.990 --> 26:18.290
I do not recall granting you permission to
leave your quarters, Lunafreya.

26:19.036 --> 26:20.288
Ravus.

26:24.792 --> 26:27.762
You are not to leave this room again
until the journey to Lucis.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.593
It is for your own good.

26:30.631 --> 26:31.928
My own good?

26:34.510 --> 26:36.308
What is truly going on here?

26:37.638 --> 26:40.608
What cause does the empire have
to see me wed to Noctis?

26:40.808 --> 26:44.153
They have offered a peace,
and your marriage is the olive branch.

26:44.478 --> 26:46.230
You expect me to believe that?

26:46.605 --> 26:48.448
What you believe does not concern me.

26:48.941 --> 26:51.069
What does concern me
is you sneaking off...

26:51.235 --> 26:54.330
...to go tell our mother's killer
about some plot you've dreamt up.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.957
You are wrong to hate King Regis.

26:57.699 --> 27:00.418
Niflheim killed Mother, not him.

27:01.662 --> 27:04.336
They murdered her
and made you their lapdog.

27:28.313 --> 27:29.610
It's done.

28:03.849 --> 28:08.400
<i>An air of jubilation has swept the city
in anticipation of the coming armistice.</i>

28:08.729 --> 28:13.075
<i>With only three days remaining until the
peace is officially signed into effect...</i>

28:13.275 --> 28:16.370
<i>...throngs of citizens
have taken to the streets to show...</i>

28:24.453 --> 28:26.922
<i>Lucis needs your strength,
young warriors.</i>

28:27.080 --> 28:28.480
<i>We don't need
any of you immigrants.</i>

28:29.833 --> 28:32.712
<i>Whatever strength you have
is on loan from the king.</i>

28:32.920 --> 28:36.220
<i>- You are nothing without him.
- Nyx, help Mother.</i>

28:36.423 --> 28:38.517
<i>Selena, get down.</i>

28:38.675 --> 28:41.770
<i>...and the waves of
imperial diplomats entering the city.</i>

28:43.472 --> 28:47.102
The princess? Are you certain?

28:47.267 --> 28:48.985
Yes, Your Majesty.

28:49.186 --> 28:53.441
She was amongst the last of
the imperial contingent to enter the city.

29:16.380 --> 29:17.723
Get in.

29:19.466 --> 29:22.185
I'm reporting to my post now though, sir.

29:22.427 --> 29:24.054
New orders.

29:24.221 --> 29:27.270
Come on.
We've got a princess to pick up.

29:34.356 --> 29:36.029
Nice ride, sir.

29:36.191 --> 29:38.410
It belongs to the prince.

29:38.568 --> 29:40.570
We've taken him outside the city.

29:40.737 --> 29:43.991
Doesn't he have a wedding to plan, sir?

29:44.825 --> 29:46.873
Cut the "sir" crap.

29:47.119 --> 29:49.087
The king has a plan of his own.

29:49.246 --> 29:52.716
Prince Noctis and Princess Lunafreya
are to meet far from Insomnia.

29:53.333 --> 29:54.413
What's she doing here then?

29:55.544 --> 29:57.842
Complicating things.

29:58.338 --> 30:01.182
We sent Crowe to find the princess
and escort her out of Tenebrae.

30:04.428 --> 30:07.398
We're still trying to figure out
what went wrong.

30:19.318 --> 30:25.166
So I know what you think about this war,
but what do you think about this peace?

30:27.617 --> 30:29.745
You happy giving up your home?

30:29.953 --> 30:32.752
It's the king's decision.
I owe him for taking me in.

30:33.332 --> 30:36.131
I was lucky.
There are people in Galahd who weren't.

30:37.085 --> 30:39.383
And they need me.

30:39.588 --> 30:41.761
So you're going back?

30:42.007 --> 30:44.556
What good will you be
without the king's magic?

30:48.221 --> 30:50.724
Yeah, always wanting to save somebody.

30:50.891 --> 30:53.485
I get it. Believe me.
But it doesn't win wars.

30:53.643 --> 30:56.021
It's not just wanting.

30:56.313 --> 30:58.407
It's not just me.

30:59.733 --> 31:01.781
Libertus is the one
you need to worry about.

31:01.943 --> 31:04.537
He'll go back if things gets worse.

31:06.907 --> 31:08.659
The worst is yet to come.

31:29.596 --> 31:31.815
Do you have any idea
who you're stopping?

31:31.973 --> 31:35.477
Open this gate now,
and maybe you'll have a job tomorrow.

31:36.019 --> 31:38.613
- King's orders.
- Are you sure you want to risk...

31:38.772 --> 31:41.525
...a diplomatic issue now, of all times?

31:41.691 --> 31:45.946
I am the personal escort
of Lady Lunafreya Nox Fleuret...

31:46.113 --> 31:48.582
...princess of the former Tenebrae and...

31:48.740 --> 31:51.619
And our kingdom's beloved bride-to-be.

31:51.785 --> 31:55.710
Welcome to sovereign jurisdiction.
We'll take care of things from here.

31:55.872 --> 31:58.392
- Forgive me, Captain Drautos.
- See Her Highness to the castle.

31:58.500 --> 32:01.595
I had no idea that you...
I wasn't made aware of any...

32:01.878 --> 32:03.880
- Excuse me. Thank you.
- No, you... I must...

32:04.089 --> 32:06.192
I must... No, I have to clear it
with my superiors first.

32:06.216 --> 32:07.763
Your Highness.

32:17.394 --> 32:22.275
Her Royal Highness,
Princess Lunafreya of Tenebrae.

32:29.823 --> 32:32.747
It has been a long time, Your Majesty.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.458
Yes.

32:36.079 --> 32:38.127
Far too long.

32:39.708 --> 32:42.587
Prince Noctis isn't here, is he?

32:43.211 --> 32:46.010
No, my dear. He is not.

32:49.050 --> 32:52.224
I am too old to fight this war.

32:52.387 --> 32:57.063
I have no choice but to receive
the empire and accept their treaty.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.023
Even so...

33:00.604 --> 33:04.199
...I had hoped to hold the wedding
elsewhere, somewhere safe.

33:04.357 --> 33:07.281
I sent one of my Glaive
to see you there, but...

33:10.238 --> 33:11.956
It is not too late.

33:12.741 --> 33:14.209
I can ready an escort.

33:14.367 --> 33:16.745
Please, go to my son.

33:18.872 --> 33:20.465
No.

33:21.708 --> 33:25.053
Wherever I go, the empire will follow.

33:25.837 --> 33:29.558
It would only place the prince
in greater danger.

33:30.425 --> 33:35.226
It is my duty to protect the prince
and see his destiny fulfilled.

33:35.388 --> 33:39.063
These 12 years
have not changed that.

33:40.185 --> 33:42.187
And what of your destiny?

33:42.938 --> 33:47.193
My duty is my destiny, Your Majesty.

33:47.776 --> 33:51.622
I'm prepared to accept
whatever may come to pass.

34:01.289 --> 34:02.461
So, what do you think?

34:02.958 --> 34:05.928
All these lands will be imperial soon.

34:06.086 --> 34:09.306
Reckon things will get better
when them Niffs start calling the shots?

34:09.464 --> 34:11.137
Not one damn bit.

34:11.299 --> 34:13.393
Don't matter who's calling the shots.

34:13.552 --> 34:15.592
Long as they're calling them
from behind the Wall...

34:15.637 --> 34:18.264
...ain't nothing gonna change
around here.

34:19.181 --> 34:20.478
Get over here.

34:20.641 --> 34:22.188
All right.

34:25.981 --> 34:27.608
<i>That's a hand!</i>

34:32.737 --> 34:34.739
I trust the reunion was a happy one?

34:34.906 --> 34:37.455
Has she been a hostage of Niflheim
all this time?

34:37.659 --> 34:39.753
She is a symbol of the peace.
That's all I'm told.

34:39.911 --> 34:40.911
Doesn't sound like it.

34:41.079 --> 34:43.181
Sounds like she's here
for something much bigger than that.

34:43.206 --> 34:45.333
Your orders are to protect her.

34:46.083 --> 34:48.678
Not to look, not to listen, not to think.

34:48.837 --> 34:50.510
Understood?

34:51.590 --> 34:52.762
Drautos.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.891
Yes, report.

35:00.557 --> 35:03.652
Get the hell out of my way. That's
my friend you got in there, damn it.

35:03.852 --> 35:05.913
Sir, you can't go in
until the examination has ended.

35:05.937 --> 35:07.939
What examination?
What the hell's going on?

35:08.106 --> 35:10.734
Hey, take it easy, big guy.

35:11.651 --> 35:14.905
These bastards rushed Crowe in there
the moment she got back.

35:15.071 --> 35:16.994
And now they won't let me in
to see her.

35:20.201 --> 35:21.703
Wait.

35:58.448 --> 36:00.826
Crowe's personal effects.

36:02.327 --> 36:04.170
Do with them as you see fit.

36:06.539 --> 36:09.793
So, what kind of mission
did you really send her on?

36:10.752 --> 36:14.723
No Glaive winds up dead
on a standard escort.

36:15.965 --> 36:19.720
I'll see the armistice does not interfere
with a full investigation.

36:22.180 --> 36:24.478
She was a good soldier.

36:24.891 --> 36:27.394
Her death will not go unanswered.

36:31.856 --> 36:33.904
What a life, huh?

36:36.569 --> 36:38.992
She was brought up an orphan.

36:39.656 --> 36:41.704
Run out of her village.

36:45.954 --> 36:48.833
I still remember the first time I saw her.

36:49.082 --> 36:51.084
Scrawny little thing...

36:51.251 --> 36:53.379
...all covered in dirt.

36:54.879 --> 36:57.098
Not a friend in the world.

37:00.427 --> 37:02.350
But those eyes...

37:02.554 --> 37:04.181
Damn.

37:04.389 --> 37:07.393
There was something
about those eyes.

37:15.316 --> 37:17.444
She deserved better.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.914
And I would've done anything
to give it to...

37:36.129 --> 37:38.632
Libertus, wait.

37:41.676 --> 37:43.019
Crowe died a Glaive.

37:43.219 --> 37:45.813
You can still honour her
by fighting as one.

37:47.474 --> 37:50.569
You're dumber than me sometimes,
you know that?

37:50.727 --> 37:52.650
Don't you get it?

37:52.937 --> 37:55.406
Lucis killed Crowe.

38:01.654 --> 38:03.702
Go back to the castle.

38:03.865 --> 38:09.167
Tell the king there's no peace to be had
from throwing the weak to the wolves.

38:09.829 --> 38:12.958
I'll fight my own fight from here on out.

38:14.751 --> 38:18.301
See you around, hero.

38:47.367 --> 38:48.539
<i>A hairpin?</i>

38:48.701 --> 38:50.581
<i>I didn't think you were
into that kind of thing.</i>

38:50.787 --> 38:53.040
<i>It's not for me.
It's a gift for the princess.</i>

39:32.161 --> 39:35.461
A most grand reception, King Regis.

39:36.124 --> 39:38.126
You honour all of Niflheim.

39:38.293 --> 39:42.218
Oh, the honour is ours,
Emperor Aldercapt.

39:42.422 --> 39:45.767
You have ventured far
to grace us with your presence.

39:46.593 --> 39:49.016
It was the very least I could do.

39:50.805 --> 39:54.901
Tomorrow will be an historic day
for both our nations.

39:55.226 --> 39:59.356
And your Insomnia is truly a marvel.

40:00.398 --> 40:03.698
My own cities pale in comparison.

40:04.861 --> 40:08.866
I pray we are able to take away much
from this visit.

40:15.997 --> 40:17.419
Hello.

40:19.626 --> 40:22.254
I am afraid we were never
properly introduced yesterday.

40:24.005 --> 40:27.509
I'm afraid it's going to have to wait,
Your Highness. I'm on guard duty.

40:27.967 --> 40:30.390
Then surely there's
no safer place for me to be.

40:32.805 --> 40:34.648
May I ask your name?

40:36.392 --> 40:39.316
Nyx. Nyx Ulric.

40:40.480 --> 40:44.201
There is something else
I wish to ask you, Nyx Ulric.

40:45.193 --> 40:47.867
King Regis said he sent
one of your order to come find me.

40:49.572 --> 40:52.496
I should like to offer my thanks
in person.

40:52.867 --> 40:55.495
Where might I find this brave soldier?

41:03.252 --> 41:04.879
Oh, I did not...

41:05.088 --> 41:07.307
- I am so sorry.
- Don't be.

41:10.718 --> 41:11.765
Here.

41:14.138 --> 41:16.232
She was carrying this.

41:17.183 --> 41:18.309
It was meant for you.

41:20.353 --> 41:21.855
For me?

41:22.689 --> 41:23.986
Keep it.

41:24.607 --> 41:26.780
She would've wanted you to have it.

41:29.862 --> 41:32.365
I will carry it with me always.

41:32.657 --> 41:34.204
Thank you.

42:03.813 --> 42:06.783
Do you have any idea
what this peace means?

42:07.066 --> 42:09.410
It means our homes are gone...

42:09.569 --> 42:10.946
...all of them...

42:11.112 --> 42:12.830
...forever.

42:17.368 --> 42:19.462
Heard I could find
some treaty haters here.

42:19.954 --> 42:22.127
I come to the right place?

42:22.290 --> 42:24.008
You certainly have.

42:24.167 --> 42:26.465
Everyone say hello to a man
who spends his days...

42:26.627 --> 42:28.721
...in the loyal service of our good king.

42:28.880 --> 42:30.723
"Spent."

42:31.299 --> 42:33.301
Those days are over.

42:34.052 --> 42:36.521
I'm done listening
to that bastard's lies.

42:36.679 --> 42:39.353
He may sit on a throne,
but he ain't no king...

42:39.515 --> 42:41.609
...least not of mine.

42:42.060 --> 42:43.733
Well, then...

42:44.353 --> 42:47.027
...welcome to the resistance, brother.

42:47.774 --> 42:49.697
I hope you're here to talk.

42:50.193 --> 42:51.615
What do you wanna know?

43:01.412 --> 43:02.914
Please...

43:03.081 --> 43:05.584
...wherever Noctis is, keep him safe.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.718
That is all I ask.

43:07.877 --> 43:10.050
To what god do you pray?

43:10.254 --> 43:13.929
You, the slave of fate and destiny.

43:15.468 --> 43:17.721
Abandon your prayers.

43:17.929 --> 43:19.647
The gods do not listen.

43:19.806 --> 43:22.776
General Glauca. Why are you here?

43:22.975 --> 43:26.900
You are far too clever
to have ever believed in this peace.

43:27.522 --> 43:31.152
Pity you couldn't see your beloved
Noctis. You have another purpose.

43:31.317 --> 43:34.036
- I'm not here for Niflheim.
- No.

43:34.195 --> 43:35.538
You are here for me.

43:35.863 --> 43:36.864
You?

43:37.031 --> 43:38.453
I do not understand.

43:38.616 --> 43:41.290
Come tomorrow, you will.

44:29.542 --> 44:31.544
<i>Niflheim contingent has left the hotel.</i>

44:31.711 --> 44:33.884
<i>Less than three hours
until the ceremony.</i>

44:34.130 --> 44:35.723
<i>Bolster the Citadel guard.</i>

44:42.972 --> 44:44.724
<i>Nyx, is the princess with you?</i>

44:44.932 --> 44:45.933
No.

44:46.100 --> 44:47.522
I'm on duty at the Citadel.

44:47.977 --> 44:50.105
<i>Well, the Niffs just left
for the ceremony.</i>

44:50.271 --> 44:52.319
<i>And she wasn't with them.</i>

45:14.420 --> 45:16.764
<i>- A homing beacon?</i>
- Yeah, I'll send the coordinates now.

45:16.923 --> 45:18.391
Can you pinpoint a location for me?

45:18.549 --> 45:20.802
<i>Sure, but it sounds like
a wild-goose chase.</i>

45:20.968 --> 45:22.848
<i>Guess you got some
free time on your hands, huh?</i>

45:22.887 --> 45:25.811
Guess I do, for better or worse.

45:49.205 --> 45:51.708
<i>Those coordinates are about
20 miles south of Insomnia.</i>

45:52.083 --> 45:53.630
Outside the Wall.

45:53.834 --> 45:56.553
<i>What the hell was Crowe doing
all the way out there?</i>

45:56.837 --> 45:58.760
No, no. They sent her to...

46:01.968 --> 46:03.311
I need another favour, Pelna.

46:03.469 --> 46:05.530
Pull those coordinates up on the radar
and let me know what you find.

46:05.554 --> 46:08.307
<i>On it. You're thinking
this is all a big deal now, huh?</i>

46:08.516 --> 46:09.642
Yeah, too big to ignore.

46:12.770 --> 46:14.898
- Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.
- Hey, hey, hey.

46:15.064 --> 46:16.987
- Whoa, wait a minute.
- Stop right there.

46:21.779 --> 46:24.658
Listen up. This is not the gate watch.

46:24.824 --> 46:28.795
This is the heart of our city,
the home of our king.

46:28.953 --> 46:31.627
The ceremony must not be disturbed.

46:31.789 --> 46:35.134
Neutralise any threat quickly and quietly.

46:35.543 --> 46:36.965
Is that understood?

46:37.128 --> 46:38.926
Yes, sir.

47:24.633 --> 47:26.556
Glaive to command.
Are you there, captain?

47:26.719 --> 47:28.187
Urgent.

47:29.221 --> 47:30.973
Damn it, Drautos.

47:31.974 --> 47:35.103
<i>Jackpot, Nyx. There's a whole fleet of
airships sitting at that spot.</i>

47:35.269 --> 47:37.271
- Niflheim.
<i>- Yup, and from the looks of it...</i>

47:37.438 --> 47:38.985
<i>...I'd say they're headed to war.</i>

47:39.190 --> 47:40.667
- Where's the captain?
<i>- Should be at the Citadel.</i>

47:40.691 --> 47:42.091
There's no answer on his frequency.

47:42.151 --> 47:44.546
<i>I don't know, must have his hands full
with the escort detail.</i>

47:44.570 --> 47:48.120
Pelna, one last favour.
I need you to prep the Glaive for action.

47:48.282 --> 47:49.454
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

47:49.617 --> 47:51.377
<i>You wanna deploy
without the captain's order?</i>

47:51.535 --> 47:52.832
Trust me. Just get it done.

47:52.995 --> 47:54.713
<i>Wait, what am I supposed to tell...?</i>

47:54.914 --> 47:55.961
Stand down, Glaive.

48:01.712 --> 48:03.840
The ceremony is in less than two hours.

48:04.006 --> 48:05.883
We must make ready.

48:08.427 --> 48:10.100
Very well.

48:10.388 --> 48:11.560
Your Majesty.

48:11.764 --> 48:13.607
A man of the Kingsglaive is here, sire.

48:13.766 --> 48:15.143
He demands an audience.

48:15.393 --> 48:16.815
"Demands"?

48:17.311 --> 48:18.511
- Your Majesty, please.
- Halt.

48:18.854 --> 48:20.606
Give the order to deploy the Glaive.

48:23.567 --> 48:24.864
You.

48:25.069 --> 48:27.822
A Niflheim fleet makes ready for war
20 miles to the south.

48:27.988 --> 48:29.740
An imperial fleet.

48:29.990 --> 48:31.333
And they have the princess.

48:33.244 --> 48:36.339
Clarus, post guards
outside the treaty room.

48:36.497 --> 48:38.377
It will be seen
as a lack of faith in the peace.

48:38.541 --> 48:40.168
Which we all harbour.

48:40.626 --> 48:42.378
See it done.

48:42.753 --> 48:45.131
We may well have to take
Emperor Aldercapt into custody.

48:45.464 --> 48:47.011
Detain him?

48:47.174 --> 48:49.472
That would go beyond
a new declaration of war.

48:49.635 --> 48:52.058
We are still at war, Clarus.

48:53.305 --> 48:56.479
And you, Nyx Ulric.

48:56.934 --> 48:58.982
How soon can the Kingsglaive deploy?

49:00.396 --> 49:02.615
On your word, at once.

49:03.149 --> 49:04.776
Go, then.

49:05.109 --> 49:06.486
Save Luna.

49:11.740 --> 49:13.458
What if this is a diversion?

49:13.659 --> 49:14.911
Not likely.

49:15.077 --> 49:17.296
Tenebrae's princess is on board.

49:22.835 --> 49:24.337
We've got two jobs.

49:25.421 --> 49:26.718
Save her.

49:27.339 --> 49:30.343
And stop those Niff ships
from flying on Insomnia.

49:37.308 --> 49:39.106
We go in teams.

49:39.852 --> 49:42.776
Standard infiltrate and extract.

49:43.397 --> 49:45.650
Nyx, you command. We'll follow.

49:48.819 --> 49:52.289
The Glaive stands together,
captain or no.

49:52.490 --> 49:53.537
For hearth.

49:53.699 --> 49:55.201
And home!

50:07.546 --> 50:12.552
<i>We are less than 20 minutes away
from the signing of this historic treaty.</i>

50:21.227 --> 50:23.195
<i>I received word
of the king's order to deploy.</i>

50:23.354 --> 50:24.856
<i>I'll see to matters in the city.</i>

50:25.940 --> 50:28.944
<i>You have your mission,
and it won't be easy.</i>

50:29.109 --> 50:30.531
<i>The objective is two-fold.</i>

50:30.694 --> 50:32.947
<i>Secure the hostage,
and stay the enemy advance.</i>

50:33.197 --> 50:35.245
<i>Just be careful.</i>

50:35.407 --> 50:37.751
<i>One Glaive already died
for this princess.</i>

50:37.952 --> 50:40.501
<i>Niflheim won't give her up easily.</i>

50:53.842 --> 50:54.934
<i>Team Two.</i>

51:14.196 --> 51:15.448
<i>Oh, man.</i>

51:15.656 --> 51:17.283
<i>Hurry up, Nyx!</i>

51:24.415 --> 51:25.917
<i>Help!</i>

51:40.055 --> 51:41.602
Over here.

51:43.309 --> 51:44.856
Preparing to head below deck.

51:45.019 --> 51:47.693
<i>Do not engage the enemy
until instructed.</i>

51:47.855 --> 51:49.277
<i>The ceremony is underway.</i>

51:49.440 --> 51:52.193
<i>Let's wait and see
how Niflheim plays this.</i>

51:57.323 --> 51:59.371
The Kingsglaive
have infiltrated the ships.

51:59.533 --> 52:01.911
So everything's going according to plan.

52:29.855 --> 52:35.237
Ulric reporting. Six Niflheim airships
confirmed inbound for Insomnia.

52:39.907 --> 52:43.957
Nyx, this doesn't feel like a war fleet.

53:07.976 --> 53:10.946
I think I might've found her.
I got a guarded door here.

53:11.105 --> 53:14.109
<i>Two Niff MTs. What's the plan?</i>

53:16.735 --> 53:18.612
Hold position.

53:18.821 --> 53:22.621
Arrived at destination.
High possibility of target in the vicinity.

53:25.285 --> 53:27.504
<i>Proceed to secure.</i>

53:27.746 --> 53:29.089
It's going to mean a fight.

53:29.289 --> 53:31.883
<i>Keep it quiet and keep it confined.</i>

53:32.042 --> 53:35.137
Pelna, you're clear to engage.
But keep it quiet.

53:35.337 --> 53:37.135
I'm on my way.

53:42.678 --> 53:44.271
Forgive my delay.

53:44.430 --> 53:46.728
A bit of unforeseen trouble.

53:46.890 --> 53:49.734
Nothing too vexing, I hope.

53:50.102 --> 53:52.696
A simple theft, nothing more.

53:52.855 --> 53:55.153
A daring thief, to steal from the king.

53:55.983 --> 54:01.661
Perhaps magical walls and castle gates
do not keep all things safe.

54:01.822 --> 54:03.369
Perhaps.

54:03.824 --> 54:07.670
But no matter. That which was taken
will soon be returned.

54:07.828 --> 54:09.671
Impressive.

54:09.913 --> 54:14.043
You are a paragon of kingly composure.

54:15.544 --> 54:17.717
But I must ask...

54:17.963 --> 54:20.591
...how can you be so sure?

54:21.258 --> 54:24.057
Because this thing is no mere trinket.

54:24.219 --> 54:27.063
It possesses a will all its own.

54:27.431 --> 54:30.435
Enough to break any thief's grasp.

54:32.603 --> 54:37.484
That sounds a very fine prize indeed.

54:46.116 --> 54:48.744
Not now, damn it.

54:50.370 --> 54:52.464
For me? You shouldn't have.

54:56.251 --> 54:58.720
Target confirmed. She's unharmed.

55:03.884 --> 55:07.354
The Glaives have recovered the princess,
Your Majesty.

55:11.016 --> 55:13.314
<i>Have you found your thief?</i>

55:13.519 --> 55:14.896
We have.

55:15.062 --> 55:17.656
And what was stolen remains intact.

55:17.815 --> 55:19.237
Joyous news.

55:19.399 --> 55:21.868
I am relieved to hear it.

55:22.778 --> 55:24.371
Tell me...

55:24.696 --> 55:25.993
...how heavy a sentence...

55:26.156 --> 55:29.160
...does the crime of theft
carry in your empire?

55:29.368 --> 55:30.711
Among the heaviest.

55:30.869 --> 55:33.213
Although there is one...

55:33.872 --> 55:35.089
...exception.

55:36.083 --> 55:38.427
Things are about to get ugly over here.

55:40.504 --> 55:42.632
Pelna, get out of there. It's a trap.

55:43.423 --> 55:45.846
- What is that?
- A curious old law...

55:46.009 --> 55:48.637
...I still permit in the outlands.

55:48.804 --> 55:51.683
A thief who escapes his captor...

55:51.849 --> 55:54.443
...can no longer be held to account
for his crime.

55:56.019 --> 55:58.021
A warning to the victim.

55:58.230 --> 56:02.531
Never show weakness,
lest you forgo the hand of justice.

56:02.734 --> 56:04.987
Oh, no, good king.

56:06.071 --> 56:08.073
Far from it.

56:08.407 --> 56:10.330
<i>The treaty is now on the table.</i>

56:10.492 --> 56:13.086
<i>The countdown begins
to this historical moment.</i>

56:13.245 --> 56:17.375
<i>It is a warning
to the hand of justice itself...</i>

56:17.958 --> 56:21.258
...never to loose its grip.

56:33.932 --> 56:35.809
Unit One, secure the perimeter.

56:35.976 --> 56:37.819
Unit Two, stand your ground.

56:39.605 --> 56:41.198
Pelna.

56:41.356 --> 56:44.701
One Tenebrae princess, safe and...

56:47.446 --> 56:48.447
Come on.

57:13.472 --> 57:16.191
The crystal. They're after the crystal.

57:21.355 --> 57:23.699
There's something going on below deck.

57:24.149 --> 57:26.652
The ship's not going to make it
to Insom...

57:33.158 --> 57:34.785
You...

57:37.079 --> 57:38.456
<i>What's going on?</i>

57:38.622 --> 57:39.839
<i>Insomnia is under attack.</i>

57:40.707 --> 57:42.584
Who brought you here?

57:43.001 --> 57:45.129
- General Glauca.
- You were bait.

57:45.295 --> 57:47.514
Us coming here was all part of their plan.

58:14.658 --> 58:18.083
Target secured.
Request permission to withdraw.

58:20.789 --> 58:21.836
<i>Granted. Get to...</i>

58:47.399 --> 58:49.652
The crystal will not serve you.

58:49.860 --> 58:51.828
Nor you...

58:52.070 --> 58:55.074
...once I take it from this accursed city.

58:55.866 --> 58:58.540
It's not the crystal I'm here for.

58:58.952 --> 59:01.046
The Wall. It's gone.

59:04.166 --> 59:05.418
Fall back. It's a trap.

59:13.592 --> 59:15.640
What the hell is going on?

59:26.521 --> 59:28.023
Traitors.

59:28.899 --> 59:30.822
What's got into you?

01:02:17.025 --> 01:02:19.448
Come, we must escape while we can.

01:02:19.611 --> 01:02:21.284
No, Clarus.

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:24.916
I fear escape is no longer an option.

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:34.922
General Glauca.

01:02:39.839 --> 01:02:42.012
Can you make it up? Can you stand?

01:03:03.488 --> 01:03:04.956
Luche!

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:13.878
What are you doing?

01:03:22.007 --> 01:03:24.009
You gotta be kidding me.

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:32.275
They teach piloting
back at the royal academy?

01:03:32.434 --> 01:03:34.186
Give me that.

01:03:39.065 --> 01:03:41.693
Been a long time
since I fought at your side, old friend.

01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:43.237
Yes...

01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:46.239
...but this time it is not your fight.

01:03:46.406 --> 01:03:48.124
If you wish to leave, go now.

01:03:48.283 --> 01:03:51.537
And abandon my king? I think not.

01:03:51.703 --> 01:03:55.173
Besides, our magic is bound to you.

01:03:55.707 --> 01:03:58.051
If you fall, Lucis falls.

01:03:58.877 --> 01:04:01.175
Then let us once more into the fray...

01:04:01.338 --> 01:04:02.931
...old friend.

01:04:29.657 --> 01:04:31.830
You must take me back to King Regis.

01:04:31.993 --> 01:04:34.712
Are you out of your mind?
Insomnia's a war zone.

01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:37.708
I have a duty. I cannot neglect it.

01:04:37.874 --> 01:04:41.174
- Yeah, I heard all that before.
- Then you know we must hurry.

01:04:41.336 --> 01:04:43.213
Hurry to do what? Get yourself killed?

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:44.381
I do not fear death.

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:47.426
Enough with all this brave princess act.

01:04:51.304 --> 01:04:53.932
Just pray this thing will make the trip.

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:20.003
Clarus.

01:05:23.795 --> 01:05:28.050
Well, I daresay everything has proceeded
according to plan.

01:05:28.633 --> 01:05:30.556
- No?
- So it has.

01:05:30.718 --> 01:05:32.391
We have broken the Wall.

01:05:32.554 --> 01:05:35.103
All that remains is to break the city.

01:05:37.058 --> 01:05:39.356
Shall we take our leave, then?

01:05:39.519 --> 01:05:41.567
The sun will soon set.

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:46.242
We need not be here
to witness the terrors of the night.

01:05:58.371 --> 01:05:59.497
The crystal.

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:06.088
You're going too fast.
We have to land.

01:06:06.254 --> 01:06:10.225
- You're gonna have to give me a minute.
- There is no time. I will go on my own.

01:06:10.383 --> 01:06:13.478
You got wings underneath that dress?
You can't use magic.

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:16.681
Not all miracles are made by magic.

01:06:16.848 --> 01:06:18.566
I do not fear death.

01:06:18.725 --> 01:06:21.649
What I fear is doing nothing
and losing everything.

01:06:23.938 --> 01:06:25.030
Oh, come on.

01:06:32.113 --> 01:06:35.663
You can thank magic for that miracle,
Your Highness.

01:06:56.179 --> 01:06:57.476
The reckoning is at hand.

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:03.603
Dawn of a new age.

01:07:07.815 --> 01:07:11.069
You have the crystal.
What more would you take from me?

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.798
The Ring of the Lucii.

01:07:28.294 --> 01:07:31.298
<i>I lost my mother, my country,
my birth-right.</i>

01:07:31.464 --> 01:07:33.887
Niflheim was the only life left to me.

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:36.719
But all of that was for this.

01:07:38.972 --> 01:07:40.440
The ring belongs to me now.

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:54.780
Hear me, Lucian kings of old,
for I am Ravus Nox Fleuret...

01:07:54.988 --> 01:07:58.333
...and none is more worthy of your power
than I.

01:07:59.117 --> 01:08:02.462
No. Why?

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:04.622
Why do you refuse me?

01:08:25.727 --> 01:08:27.149
Look out.

01:08:52.837 --> 01:08:54.384
Quickly, through here.

01:09:14.567 --> 01:09:16.694
This leads to a hidden passageway.

01:09:16.861 --> 01:09:17.908
Follow it.

01:09:18.071 --> 01:09:19.788
Once you are away, make for Altissia.

01:09:19.947 --> 01:09:21.198
Noctis awaits you there.

01:09:22.075 --> 01:09:24.294
- Your Majesty.
- You knew this was coming...

01:09:24.452 --> 01:09:27.456
Yes. But it was the only way
to draw their wrath from Noctis.

01:09:29.122 --> 01:09:31.341
Is that the way of our king?

01:09:31.501 --> 01:09:34.720
Sacrifice Lucian sons to save his own?

01:09:34.879 --> 01:09:36.551
To save the world.

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:40.810
See Luna safely to Altissia.

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:45.473
This is not an order
from a king to his Glaive.

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:49.144
This is a plea from one man to another.
Please, Nyx Ulric, keep her safe.

01:09:50.310 --> 01:09:51.984
For the future of all.

01:09:52.145 --> 01:09:53.944
The future?

01:09:56.943 --> 01:09:58.570
Here.

01:09:58.861 --> 01:10:00.158
Take this.

01:10:00.321 --> 01:10:03.871
It is time it passed to another's keeping.

01:10:35.356 --> 01:10:38.405
No, please. Stop.

01:10:38.693 --> 01:10:40.491
- Get back.
- Please. Don't leave us.

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:45.496
I know your mother
would wish the same as me.

01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:49.500
That you and Noctis live happily.

01:10:49.662 --> 01:10:52.666
All those years captive
because I failed you.

01:10:52.832 --> 01:10:53.879
Not again.

01:10:54.041 --> 01:10:56.920
Locked doors
will seal your fate no longer.

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:59.009
King Regis...

01:11:00.673 --> 01:11:03.893
Our hope goes with you now,
Nyx Ulric. Godspeed.

01:11:40.213 --> 01:11:41.840
Behold the King of Lucis...

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:45.593
...who hoarded tranquility
within his precious walls.

01:11:46.427 --> 01:11:49.601
Where is your tranquility now, king?

01:11:50.515 --> 01:11:54.691
Here is your peace,
by steel's swift descent.

01:12:10.576 --> 01:12:12.249
Go.

01:12:32.223 --> 01:12:35.648
No. We must get away from here.

01:12:36.769 --> 01:12:38.612
It is what your king wanted.

01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:21.238
<i>Lady Lunafreya has escaped
with the ring.</i>

01:13:21.856 --> 01:13:22.948
<i>Find her at once.</i>

01:13:23.107 --> 01:13:24.575
<i>She is not to leave the city.</i>

01:13:26.903 --> 01:13:29.702
<i>- Ulric to command. Come in, captain.
- Footage of the perpetrators...</i>

01:13:29.864 --> 01:13:31.866
<i>...was captured
by a nearby surveillance camera.</i>

01:13:32.033 --> 01:13:34.001
<i>Here are images of the six suspects.</i>

01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:38.040
<i>One has been identified
as Galahdian refugee, Libertus Ostium...</i>

01:13:38.205 --> 01:13:41.584
<i>...a former member
of the Lucian Kingsglaive.</i>

01:13:43.628 --> 01:13:45.505
Hey, come here. Come here.

01:13:45.671 --> 01:13:47.673
I got you, I got you. You're all right.

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.513
You're okay.

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:51.681
It's fine.

01:13:51.844 --> 01:13:53.096
We're free.

01:13:53.596 --> 01:13:55.064
We're free now.

01:13:55.222 --> 01:13:57.190
We're free? What do you mean,
"We're free"?

01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:59.944
The empire. They promised.

01:14:01.062 --> 01:14:02.735
This district's ours.

01:14:03.147 --> 01:14:04.649
All the refugees.

01:14:04.815 --> 01:14:06.658
It's our new home.

01:14:07.276 --> 01:14:10.405
- The empire? You went in with Niflheim?
- Here.

01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:13.708
Take this. Meet up with the others.

01:14:15.618 --> 01:14:18.792
You're the hero of our revolution,
brother.

01:14:23.918 --> 01:14:24.965
Damn it.

01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:36.268
This guy just doesn't know
when he's beat.

01:14:36.889 --> 01:14:39.733
- Can you drive?
- I can try.

01:14:43.354 --> 01:14:44.697
I'll be right back.

01:14:55.783 --> 01:14:58.252
No warping for you this time, hero.

01:15:02.915 --> 01:15:05.088
Give me the wheel. Go.

01:15:07.795 --> 01:15:09.172
You are without your magic.

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:13.013
You noticed that, huh?
It must have died with the king.

01:15:13.384 --> 01:15:15.603
You're making a mess of my city, Glaive.

01:15:15.761 --> 01:15:17.481
I thought I told you
not to go playing hero.

01:15:18.139 --> 01:15:19.311
Leave the ship to me.

01:15:19.849 --> 01:15:22.193
Looks like you got a royal fare to see to.

01:16:11.776 --> 01:16:13.073
Move it.

01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:41.146
Maybe not all miracles
are made by magic.

01:16:50.272 --> 01:16:51.774
Oh, great.

01:17:09.917 --> 01:17:11.965
The hell did you do
to piss these things off?

01:17:12.128 --> 01:17:14.881
It's not me they're after.
It's the ring.

01:17:15.047 --> 01:17:18.517
What's so special about this ring?
Don't tell me the future's riding on it.

01:17:18.676 --> 01:17:20.556
He who wears the ring
communes with the Lucii...

01:17:20.636 --> 01:17:22.980
- ...and commands great power.
- What kind of power?

01:17:23.139 --> 01:17:26.018
A forbidden one.
Sealed within the ring, long ago.

01:17:26.725 --> 01:17:31.105
The Old Wall.
I thought that was just a bedtime story.

01:17:38.737 --> 01:17:40.205
I can assure you it is not.

01:17:40.364 --> 01:17:43.493
But the Lucii grant their power
only to those they deem worthy.

01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:45.787
So that guy who tried it on back there...

01:17:45.953 --> 01:17:47.796
...I guess he wasn't deemed worthy.

01:17:49.373 --> 01:17:50.625
That was my brother.

01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:55.633
These 12 years have changed Ravus.

01:17:55.838 --> 01:17:58.717
He is bound by the past,
and lost in his lust for power.

01:18:00.843 --> 01:18:02.265
How the hell did they find us?

01:18:22.114 --> 01:18:24.583
Your hairpin. They're tracking it.
Give it to me.

01:18:32.249 --> 01:18:36.379
I had a little sister once.
She was killed when the empire came.

01:18:38.214 --> 01:18:40.012
I couldn't save her.

01:18:40.883 --> 01:18:43.887
I was as helpless then as I am now.

01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:49.104
I couldn't show her the future
she wanted.

01:18:51.268 --> 01:18:55.273
True power is not something that is found
by those who seek it.

01:18:56.357 --> 01:18:58.906
It is something that comes
to those who deserve it.

01:19:01.695 --> 01:19:03.948
Your sister wanted you to see
a future as well.

01:19:07.034 --> 01:19:09.958
Anyone would wish the same
for family they love.

01:19:14.166 --> 01:19:16.794
You don't pull any punches, do you?

01:19:24.677 --> 01:19:26.054
I'm over here.

01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:28.564
<i>Do you hear me?
Repeat, this is Drautos.</i>

01:19:28.722 --> 01:19:30.065
<i>Can you hear me? Over.</i>

01:19:30.349 --> 01:19:32.397
Your timing's impeccable, captain.

01:19:37.856 --> 01:19:39.483
If the Lucii are real...

01:19:39.650 --> 01:19:42.494
...they sure don't seem to mind
their city getting torn apart.

01:19:48.492 --> 01:19:50.620
<i>You're to rendezvous and regroup.
Understood?</i>

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:54.548
Might not be so easy, captain.

01:19:55.958 --> 01:19:58.131
My wings have been clipped,
if you didn't know.

01:20:30.492 --> 01:20:32.165
<i>Ulric. Are you all right?</i>

01:20:33.787 --> 01:20:35.789
I'm not dead, if that's what you mean, sir.

01:20:36.582 --> 01:20:38.755
<i>Head for Section D
as soon as you can.</i>

01:20:38.917 --> 01:20:41.215
<i>I'll have an evacuation team ready.</i>

01:20:41.712 --> 01:20:44.215
Don't suppose you could meet me
at the gate.

01:20:44.381 --> 01:20:46.725
I'd kind of like to
get the hell out of this city.

01:20:46.884 --> 01:20:49.558
<i>Imperials hold all exits.
There's no way through.</i>

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:50.972
<i>I'll meet you at Section D.</i>

01:20:51.138 --> 01:20:55.188
<i>Cut all radio contact until then.
And make sure you get there.</i>

01:20:55.351 --> 01:20:56.398
It's a date, sir.

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:15.538
Ain't no turning back now.

01:21:15.704 --> 01:21:17.001
<i>Status report.</i>

01:21:17.164 --> 01:21:19.166
<i>Ulric killed some good men.</i>

01:21:19.333 --> 01:21:21.552
<i>- What about the ring?
- We don't have it yet.</i>

01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:25.131
<i>This is Glauca. King Regis is dead.</i>

01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:27.884
<i>The ring is on its way to Section D.</i>

01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:30.599
<i>We must recover the ring
to realise our goal.</i>

01:21:30.761 --> 01:21:33.605
<i>If Ulric or the princess get in the way,
take them out.</i>

01:21:33.764 --> 01:21:36.062
<i>Reclaim our hearth and home.</i>

01:21:36.225 --> 01:21:38.148
"Hearth and home"?

01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:39.436
<i>Libertus, come in.</i>

01:21:39.603 --> 01:21:41.276
<i>Where are you? Are you all right?</i>

01:21:41.438 --> 01:21:42.781
I'm fine.

01:21:43.649 --> 01:21:45.526
On the way back to base now.

01:21:45.692 --> 01:21:48.161
<i>We need you to head to the junction
in Section D.</i>

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:51.540
<i>We're gonna join with another unit,
make a clean sweep of the place.</i>

01:21:51.698 --> 01:21:54.326
<i>We're one step away
from realising this revolution.</i>

01:21:54.493 --> 01:21:56.712
<i>Let's not let Pruvia's death be in vain.</i>

01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:59.123
<i>We'll be waiting for you, hero.</i>

01:22:26.024 --> 01:22:28.948
- Don't move until I say it's safe, all right?
- I won't.

01:22:37.369 --> 01:22:39.121
Ulric, reporting.

01:22:40.372 --> 01:22:42.466
I have the princess.

01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:44.718
She's alive and well.

01:22:52.593 --> 01:22:53.936
- No!
- Get out of here.

01:22:57.139 --> 01:22:59.642
You've got some fight in you, Nyx,
I'll give you that.

01:23:01.602 --> 01:23:03.229
Run. Now.

01:23:05.022 --> 01:23:09.243
I can't believe you're still moving
with that hollowpoint in you.

01:23:09.401 --> 01:23:13.076
All Crowe could do was scream,
when one tore her insides apart.

01:23:14.448 --> 01:23:18.203
- Why'd you do it?
- Because the Kingsglaive is nothing.

01:23:18.368 --> 01:23:19.961
An old man's battle fodder...

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:21.872
...sent to die in insomnia's war...

01:23:22.039 --> 01:23:23.791
...while our homes
are bound and shackled.

01:23:24.791 --> 01:23:26.668
Niflheim took your home.

01:23:28.962 --> 01:23:30.805
Took all our homes!

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:33.763
Nothing will ever change that.

01:23:34.051 --> 01:23:35.974
You never were too smart.

01:23:37.638 --> 01:23:40.312
You could've had a new future
with the empire.

01:23:57.491 --> 01:24:00.370
There's nowhere to run, princess.

01:24:00.869 --> 01:24:01.870
The ring.

01:24:04.081 --> 01:24:05.628
Give it to me.

01:24:28.897 --> 01:24:30.820
So many dead over so simple a thing.

01:24:31.984 --> 01:24:35.158
But why? For what?

01:24:35.696 --> 01:24:37.369
Power.

01:24:37.614 --> 01:24:40.208
Untold power,
beyond the control of someone like you.

01:24:42.202 --> 01:24:43.704
Power...

01:25:24.077 --> 01:25:25.750
Captain.

01:25:38.759 --> 01:25:40.227
Nyx.

01:25:42.721 --> 01:25:46.351
It's over. The daemons are unleashed.

01:25:47.351 --> 01:25:49.900
Lucis is fallen.

01:25:52.105 --> 01:25:53.448
Surrender the ring.

01:25:57.444 --> 01:26:00.118
Plan on giving those kings
a piece of your mind, princess?

01:26:01.865 --> 01:26:04.914
You got a destiny to take care of here,
remember?

01:26:05.327 --> 01:26:08.422
Besides, didn't anyone tell you?

01:26:11.416 --> 01:26:12.838
I'm the hero around here.

01:26:30.477 --> 01:26:35.028
Show yourselves, kings of Lucis.

01:26:39.528 --> 01:26:42.702
You call upon the wards
of this world's future, mortal.

01:26:42.864 --> 01:26:47.620
And if you come lusting for our power,
you must first stand in our judgement.

01:26:47.994 --> 01:26:52.625
How long will you do nothing
whilst Insomnia burns?

01:26:53.083 --> 01:26:55.461
Old or new, or whatever it is.

01:26:56.545 --> 01:26:58.673
Summon your Wall.

01:26:59.339 --> 01:27:00.932
You do not command us.

01:27:01.091 --> 01:27:04.265
Yours is not even royal blood.

01:27:04.428 --> 01:27:07.523
It does not fall to us to guard your city.

01:27:07.681 --> 01:27:09.149
Man is a fool creature...

01:27:09.307 --> 01:27:12.356
...clinging to his past
and cowering from his future.

01:27:12.519 --> 01:27:16.114
Wasting his strength on bygone days.

01:27:16.523 --> 01:27:19.276
And what future are you wards of?

01:27:19.443 --> 01:27:20.786
So shortsighted.

01:27:20.944 --> 01:27:23.288
And cursed never to rise above it.

01:27:23.488 --> 01:27:24.614
Wait.

01:27:24.781 --> 01:27:28.126
I have seen what this brave soul
is prepared to do.

01:27:28.285 --> 01:27:31.038
He, too, seeks to safeguard the future.

01:27:31.204 --> 01:27:32.456
Your Majesty.

01:27:33.206 --> 01:27:37.052
Very well, young king.
We will weigh your Warrior's worth.

01:27:37.252 --> 01:27:39.755
But our boon does not come cheap.

01:27:40.130 --> 01:27:46.137
The cost is a life. His or hers.

01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:47.972
No.

01:27:49.514 --> 01:27:51.687
To hell with your power.

01:27:52.976 --> 01:27:55.024
I'm not here for it.

01:27:56.438 --> 01:28:00.614
I only came to tell you, you are no kings.

01:28:01.276 --> 01:28:04.155
Your worth has been weighed
and found wanting.

01:28:04.362 --> 01:28:06.080
Now burn.

01:28:12.329 --> 01:28:15.048
You're going to lose your precious ring.

01:28:17.834 --> 01:28:20.587
But it's not too late to save it.

01:28:21.463 --> 01:28:23.465
You mean to barter for your life.

01:28:23.632 --> 01:28:25.600
No, no.

01:28:26.635 --> 01:28:28.763
My life is nothing.

01:28:31.264 --> 01:28:34.643
Giving a future
to those who want to see it...

01:28:36.311 --> 01:28:38.063
...is everything.

01:28:40.065 --> 01:28:43.490
You do not fear,
even if that future is doomed.

01:28:43.652 --> 01:28:47.748
If that sentiment is not false,
perhaps you are worthy.

01:28:48.281 --> 01:28:50.704
We will grant you our light.

01:28:50.867 --> 01:28:53.791
But know it will set when the sun rises.

01:28:54.329 --> 01:28:57.629
And the price for it will be your life.

01:28:59.876 --> 01:29:02.846
You guys drive a hard bargain.

01:29:05.507 --> 01:29:07.430
<i>Where do I sign?</i>

01:29:17.394 --> 01:29:19.613
I could get used to this.

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:26.194
Nyx...

01:29:27.445 --> 01:29:29.163
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

01:29:30.365 --> 01:29:31.992
You saved me.

01:29:32.576 --> 01:29:33.998
Now I owe you.

01:29:34.202 --> 01:29:35.829
For a change.

01:29:36.955 --> 01:29:38.377
I'm gonna need another favour.

01:29:38.540 --> 01:29:42.761
Meet Lunafreya Nox Fleuret,
our prince's beloved bride-to-be.

01:29:42.919 --> 01:29:45.843
And she has the future of the world
in her hands.

01:29:46.006 --> 01:29:49.385
Keep her safe, get her out of Insomnia.

01:29:50.093 --> 01:29:52.437
Oh, I almost forgot. You'll need this.

01:29:54.431 --> 01:29:57.310
Give Prince Noctis my regards.

01:29:58.018 --> 01:30:00.112
Libertus will take care of you from here.

01:30:00.312 --> 01:30:03.441
Have a safe journey, Your Highness.

01:30:03.982 --> 01:30:06.861
- What will come of you?
- What the hell are you doing?

01:30:07.444 --> 01:30:09.412
Following the kings' orders.

01:30:10.196 --> 01:30:12.699
I will see the ring to Noctis.

01:30:13.992 --> 01:30:16.336
The future will be safe. I swear it.

01:30:26.504 --> 01:30:29.428
Planning on punching your way
out of the city? Keep it.

01:30:30.091 --> 01:30:31.934
- Now we're even.
- No.

01:30:32.302 --> 01:30:34.680
We'll settle up
once you're back in Galahd.

01:30:34.888 --> 01:30:37.391
Me and everyone else
will be waiting for you.

01:30:37.599 --> 01:30:38.976
I'm counting on you...

01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:41.357
...hero.

01:31:00.163 --> 01:31:03.383
- Buckle up, princess.
- My life is in your hands.

01:31:13.176 --> 01:31:16.555
So, the power of the Lucii returns.

01:31:17.055 --> 01:31:18.728
No matter. You are out of time.

01:31:18.890 --> 01:31:20.984
For you, I'll make some.

01:31:54.759 --> 01:31:57.137
What can you hope to do?

01:31:58.638 --> 01:32:01.562
One man against an empire.

01:32:01.725 --> 01:32:03.523
Against the daemons.

01:32:03.810 --> 01:32:07.781
How will you save Insomnia
with no wall to protect you?

01:32:09.357 --> 01:32:13.362
You've got it all wrong.
I'm not fighting to save Insomnia.

01:33:39.405 --> 01:33:44.457
So this is the might of the Old Wall.

01:33:44.661 --> 01:33:48.336
Marvellous. Truly marvellous.

01:34:59.402 --> 01:35:01.404
Why'd you do it?

01:35:01.696 --> 01:35:03.994
Lucis. Niflheim.

01:35:04.157 --> 01:35:06.831
It isn't who we fight for that matters,
only what.

01:35:07.744 --> 01:35:11.874
We fight for our homes.
That is where our allegiance lies.

01:36:31.327 --> 01:36:33.750
That's not something you see every day.

01:36:50.013 --> 01:36:53.313
Oh, such a pitiable waste.

01:36:53.474 --> 01:36:58.230
All those beautiful city streets,
all laid to unsightly ruin.

01:36:58.438 --> 01:37:01.817
- I will return to Niflheim.
- So soon?

01:37:02.567 --> 01:37:04.160
The crystal is ours.

01:37:05.028 --> 01:37:06.245
Finish this...

01:37:06.571 --> 01:37:09.040
...and see the daemons disposed of.

01:37:09.198 --> 01:37:10.575
As you command.

01:37:12.410 --> 01:37:14.833
Such a pitiable waste.

01:37:28.176 --> 01:37:30.725
How could you serve the empire?

01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:34.019
After everything they did?

01:37:34.682 --> 01:37:38.186
I do not fault them
for taking what was given.

01:37:40.313 --> 01:37:42.907
I fault the man who gave it.

01:37:43.524 --> 01:37:45.492
The man who cowered behind his wall...

01:37:45.693 --> 01:37:49.539
...and abandoned us
to save his throne and his son.

01:37:50.156 --> 01:37:53.160
Give me the ring,
and our homes will be free again.

01:37:53.326 --> 01:37:55.624
The empire has promised it.

01:37:56.329 --> 01:38:00.209
I don't see much of a future
on the other side of that promise.

01:38:00.416 --> 01:38:01.963
Don't be a fool.

01:38:02.126 --> 01:38:03.753
Save your friends.

01:38:05.213 --> 01:38:06.931
Give your dead sister peace.

01:38:08.049 --> 01:38:10.848
What do you fight for if not that?

01:38:56.097 --> 01:38:58.566
Hang on. This could get bumpy.

01:39:08.276 --> 01:39:09.903
Drautos.

01:39:18.244 --> 01:39:19.837
Here, take the wheel.

01:39:28.171 --> 01:39:29.889
Floor it!

01:39:40.183 --> 01:39:42.777
- Libertus!
- Just keep your foot on the gas.

01:40:03.456 --> 01:40:05.083
You're all right?

01:40:11.422 --> 01:40:13.595
I'll be waiting for you, hero.

01:40:40.993 --> 01:40:42.620
What of your kings' power now?

01:40:42.787 --> 01:40:46.508
They've given you a burden
you cannot hope to bear.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.718
I told you before.

01:40:49.919 --> 01:40:53.173
Just wanting doesn't win wars.

01:42:05.745 --> 01:42:11.752
For the honour of my home,
I fought and killed under a king I loathed.

01:42:13.419 --> 01:42:15.888
And still he betrayed me.

01:42:17.173 --> 01:42:19.221
He betrayed us all.

01:42:19.383 --> 01:42:23.104
We fought for the same thing. All of us.

01:42:24.472 --> 01:42:26.474
But you've looked too long on the past.

01:42:27.433 --> 01:42:28.685
You're blind to the future.

01:42:33.773 --> 01:42:35.525
Predictable.

01:42:36.233 --> 01:42:39.988
Unlike you, I learn from history.

01:42:40.446 --> 01:42:43.165
But you're a slave to the past.

01:42:43.949 --> 01:42:46.702
A man's past is his pride.

01:42:47.370 --> 01:42:48.462
No.

01:42:48.829 --> 01:42:52.504
My pride is shaping the future.

01:43:05.137 --> 01:43:07.435
Looks like I'm gonna owe him big.

01:43:23.322 --> 01:43:25.074
We're almost there.

01:43:25.658 --> 01:43:26.875
Almost.

01:43:39.547 --> 01:43:42.767
King Regis did what he did for the future.

01:43:43.759 --> 01:43:45.682
Because of him...

01:43:46.512 --> 01:43:49.311
...there's still hope for our homes.

01:43:50.474 --> 01:43:52.272
Hope...

01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:03.613
Not the worst way to go.

01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:06.328
Rule well, young king.

01:44:26.802 --> 01:44:28.304
We should move.

01:44:30.264 --> 01:44:32.608
It ain't safe here either.

01:44:35.060 --> 01:44:36.437
Hey.

01:44:37.396 --> 01:44:39.398
Don't worry about Nyx.

01:44:40.691 --> 01:44:42.864
He can take care of himself.

01:44:47.990 --> 01:44:49.412
Come on.

01:44:51.660 --> 01:44:52.912
No.

01:44:55.623 --> 01:44:57.591
We must part ways here.

01:44:58.375 --> 01:44:59.672
What?

01:45:00.377 --> 01:45:04.052
I can hardly travel in secrecy
alongside so great a hero.

01:45:05.049 --> 01:45:08.178
And I, too,
have a promise to keep to Nyx.

01:45:09.303 --> 01:45:11.726
I pray you two see each other again soon.

01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:16.147
Yeah.

01:45:18.020 --> 01:45:19.738
Me too.

01:45:22.525 --> 01:45:24.778
Thank you, Libertus.

01:45:42.503 --> 01:45:43.720
Hey, queen!

01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:47.759
You and the king
are always welcome in Galahd.

01:45:48.801 --> 01:45:51.475
Me and Nyx will be waiting for you.

01:54:48.131 --> 01:54:49.178
<i>It's been some while.</i>

01:54:49.341 --> 01:54:52.561
<i>Do you remember the last time
you saw Lady Lunafreya?</i>

01:54:53.136 --> 01:54:54.638
About 12 years ago.

01:54:54.805 --> 01:54:56.648
That would make you 8?

01:54:56.807 --> 01:54:59.276
- You were kids.
- Hope she hasn't gotten her hopes up.

01:54:59.434 --> 01:55:01.186
Why not? Calm yourself.

01:55:01.395 --> 01:55:03.363
Try and keep it together
when you meet her.

01:55:03.522 --> 01:55:06.459
- She'll expect to see a fine, young prince.
- Tell me something I don't know.

01:55:06.483 --> 01:55:08.736
We don't have time for all that.

01:55:08.902 --> 01:55:11.576
But this is your wedding
we're talking about, Noc.

01:55:11.738 --> 01:55:13.581
Knew that too.

01:55:13.740 --> 01:55:16.209
You really gotta calm down.

01:55:17.869 --> 01:55:20.292
What do you mean, "Uh-oh"?

01:55:20.455 --> 01:55:22.207
I think I know.
