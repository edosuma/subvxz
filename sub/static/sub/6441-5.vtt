00:47.981 --> 00:51.041
Hello? Is someone there?

01:48.074 --> 01:52.135
- Damn it, boy, what were you thinking?
- I'm sorry, Father. It won't happen again.

01:53.046 --> 01:55.810
What is the one rule
we live by in this house?

01:56.116 --> 01:58.482
Byron stays in the cellar.

01:58.751 --> 02:01.015
And why is that?

02:01.187 --> 02:03.246
Because Father knows
what's best for Byron.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.554
How the hell did you get out?

02:08.294 --> 02:11.991
I swear, you'd better give me
an answer right now, or I'm gonna...

02:12.165 --> 02:13.564
I pried open the lock.

02:16.870 --> 02:21.830
Get out again, boy, there will be
more than a tranquilizer in that gun.

03:36.749 --> 03:38.182
The sentiment's nice...

03:38.350 --> 03:41.911
...but the fact that you found this
in a graveyard seems a little Amityville.

03:42.088 --> 03:45.683
I think it's romantic. I haven't
gotten a love letter since third grade.

03:45.858 --> 03:47.917
- Seems like a lost art.
- Not true, not true.

03:48.094 --> 03:51.791
This morning in trig, I intercepted
a note from a wrestler to a cheerleader.

03:51.964 --> 03:55.695
It wasn't exactly poetic,
but he definitely got his point across.

03:55.868 --> 03:58.234
- Who do you think wrote it?
- I have no idea.

03:58.404 --> 03:59.803
Hey, guys.

04:01.874 --> 04:05.970
- So, what's going on?
- Lana has a secret admirer.

04:08.514 --> 04:10.448
- It's nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?

04:10.616 --> 04:12.846
What happened to romantic?

04:13.018 --> 04:14.508
Just let the boy read it.

04:23.562 --> 04:26.087
- It's a little mushy.
- I almost forgot.

04:26.265 --> 04:28.495
Clark Kent, the man of steel.

04:34.306 --> 04:35.933
I'll see you guys later.

04:36.542 --> 04:39.136
- Bye.
- Bye.

04:41.046 --> 04:44.641
If you ask me, it sounds more
like a stalker than a secret admirer.

05:31.931 --> 05:33.956
- Thanks.
- No problem.

05:37.403 --> 05:39.064
That's kind of personal.

05:41.507 --> 05:44.772
Go ahead and read it. You'll probably
agree with Clark that it's sappy.

05:49.582 --> 05:53.245
The imagery's a little naive, but the meter's
actually quite sophisticated.

05:53.419 --> 05:54.716
Who wrote this?

05:54.887 --> 05:58.721
Either an admirer or a psychopath,
depending on who you ask.

05:58.891 --> 06:01.519
That had a little edge to it,
is everything all right?

06:02.828 --> 06:07.060
Everyone's giving me a hard time about
the poem. I guess I'm just a little defensive.

06:08.734 --> 06:10.395
Take me to you

06:10.736 --> 06:12.397
Imprison me

06:12.671 --> 06:17.802
For I never shall be free
Nor ever chaste, except you ravish me

06:19.578 --> 06:22.741
John Donne.
He's one of my favorites.

06:23.682 --> 06:26.480
If I didn't know better,
I'd say I found your Achilles' heel.

06:27.786 --> 06:30.152
I didn't realize you were so into poetry.

06:44.336 --> 06:47.430
It's nice some people
appreciate artistic expression.

06:49.808 --> 06:53.266
It kind of raises the bar for
any other contenders, doesn't it, Clark?

07:00.519 --> 07:04.250
- I know things aren't great between us...
- I'm fine, Clark.

07:08.727 --> 07:11.195
Lana, I want to apologize
for ragging on the poem.

07:11.363 --> 07:13.729
Guess poetry's not for everybody.

07:14.133 --> 07:18.797
I was just surprised that you would show
Pete and Chloe and not show it to me.

07:19.004 --> 07:23.338
You can't expect me to share everything
if you're not going to be open with me.

07:26.445 --> 07:29.642
Don't you think it's weird? This guy's
sneaking around watching you.

07:30.549 --> 07:35.213
Come on, Clark. Tell me you've never
watched somebody from afar.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.688
So as you can see, sir...

07:45.864 --> 07:48.924
...or maybe not
actually see in your case...

07:49.101 --> 07:50.534
...it was an honest mistake...

07:50.703 --> 07:55.970
...and one that I promise won't ever happen
again as long as I'm working for you.

07:56.241 --> 07:57.572
Thank you, Tad.

07:57.743 --> 08:04.239
That was a very heartfelt, if
not interminably long-winded, apology.

08:05.050 --> 08:07.746
And I'm going to help
you keep that promise.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.512
Tad...

08:10.689 --> 08:13.681
...your things will be mailed to you.

08:14.526 --> 08:15.857
Are you letting me go?

08:16.161 --> 08:21.064
Never lose that grasp of the obvious, Tad.
It's one of your strongest attributes.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.502
That's the fourth one
you've devoured this month.

08:30.976 --> 08:35.275
- Where you finding these people, Lex?
- Little schools, like Harvard and Yale.

08:35.447 --> 08:38.347
I spent hours going over resumes,
looking for the perfect fit.

08:38.751 --> 08:41.948
You mustn't be fooled by a resume, Lex.

08:42.121 --> 08:46.251
You have to look into their eyes
to see if they're up to the challenge.

08:46.425 --> 08:49.019
I need your eyes to look for me, son.

08:49.294 --> 08:53.060
I see. So somehow the failure
of your assistants is my fault.

08:53.232 --> 08:57.566
Forget the self-pity, Lex,
I wasn't criticizing. I was critiquing.

08:58.337 --> 09:00.305
There's a difference.

09:01.340 --> 09:05.538
And if I recall, I didn't
ask for help. You offered.

09:05.811 --> 09:09.076
I'm glad to see your condition
hasn't softened your paternal side.

09:09.248 --> 09:11.307
My condition has nothing to do with it.

09:11.483 --> 09:14.680
You're not the master of your universe
anymore, and it's killing you.

09:14.853 --> 09:17.014
Just get me an assistant
who meets my criteria.

09:17.189 --> 09:22.422
- I don't think I would fit your criteria.
- Probably not, but nobody's perfect.

09:29.568 --> 09:34.164
At the sound of the opening bell on the
stock exchange floor Monday morning...

09:34.339 --> 09:40.608
...LuthorCorp stock adjusted dramatically
after weeks of speculation as to...

09:42.347 --> 09:45.544
I couldn't listen to another word
of that droning either.

09:46.552 --> 09:49.077
- Who is that?
- It's Martha Kent.

09:50.055 --> 09:52.489
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

09:53.092 --> 09:56.357
No, no. It's a welcome interruption.

09:56.528 --> 10:00.464
I came by to pick up the produce check
from Lex. He usually leaves it out for me.

10:01.100 --> 10:07.596
I'm afraid my presence here has thrown
Lex's regimented routine into a mild chaos.

10:08.373 --> 10:12.742
Well, I'm sure he's happy to have you here,
even if he doesn't know how to say it.

10:13.178 --> 10:15.806
Your assumption's very generous.

10:32.364 --> 10:35.197
"The plummeting stock sent a ripple
through investment houses.

10:35.367 --> 10:39.201
CEO Lionel Luthor attributed the drop
to this quarter's anticipated deficit."

10:39.371 --> 10:40.804
It's a smoke screen, isn't it?

10:40.973 --> 10:44.568
To make investors nervous so when
LuthorCorp posts less impressive gains...

10:44.743 --> 10:49.271
...the stock will have already adjusted.
- I had no idea Martha Kent...

10:49.448 --> 10:51.575
...had such keen business acumen.

10:52.618 --> 10:57.681
I wonder if your talents aren't
being wasted on organic produce.

10:58.991 --> 11:01.221
I'm going to take that as a compliment.

11:02.361 --> 11:04.226
You should.

11:40.432 --> 11:44.027
I bought you this. At the used bookstore.

11:47.439 --> 11:49.634
Edgar Allan Poe.

11:49.808 --> 11:51.708
You really know
how to pick them, Mother.

11:51.877 --> 11:56.405
Well, I read a couple of pages.
I couldn't make heads or tails.

11:58.584 --> 12:00.211
I'm surprised.

12:03.055 --> 12:05.489
He writes about pain and suffering...

12:05.657 --> 12:07.989
...and people being buried alive.

12:09.294 --> 12:13.230
Byron, I know you're upset,
but things are better this way.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.559
How can you let him do this to me?

12:17.736 --> 12:20.330
You have put your father
through enough.

12:20.505 --> 12:22.496
Just be glad things are back to normal.

12:23.075 --> 12:25.339
Normal kids aren't hunted
by their fathers.

12:25.644 --> 12:29.239
I don't want to hear another word.
You just stick to your books...

12:29.414 --> 12:32.042
...and keep your mouth shut.

12:32.217 --> 12:34.117
Everything will be fine.

13:54.900 --> 13:58.700
What am I doing? This is crazy.

14:00.038 --> 14:02.506
Wait! I got your other poem.

14:02.674 --> 14:04.335
It was beautiful.

14:05.544 --> 14:07.102
You really think so?

14:14.386 --> 14:16.377
What's your name?

14:17.289 --> 14:18.881
Byron.

14:19.591 --> 14:23.459
- Like the poet?
- Like my great-uncle.

14:23.929 --> 14:26.056
But there's nothing poetic about him.

14:26.865 --> 14:29.993
Why do you leave me these poems?

14:30.635 --> 14:32.626
Because you inspire me.

14:37.275 --> 14:38.503
No, don't!

14:38.810 --> 14:40.141
Get away from her!

14:40.379 --> 14:41.869
Clark!

14:44.649 --> 14:46.412
Oh, my God.

14:48.086 --> 14:50.111
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

14:50.655 --> 14:52.646
Fine.

15:11.510 --> 15:13.842
I can't believe I passed out.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.438
I'm sorry I scared you.

15:16.848 --> 15:18.941
It's okay, Clark.

15:19.117 --> 15:21.642
You were protecting a beautiful young lady.

15:21.820 --> 15:23.651
It was chivalrous.

15:27.058 --> 15:30.357
You're lucky to have a boyfriend
who cares so much about you.

15:32.364 --> 15:33.592
Clark's just a friend.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.661
An overprotective one.

15:39.404 --> 15:41.429
If I could write the beauty of your eyes

15:42.808 --> 15:44.435
And number all your graces

15:44.976 --> 15:47.444
The age to come would say
"This poet lies

15:49.815 --> 15:53.080
Such heavenly touches
Ne'er touched earthly faces"

15:56.421 --> 15:57.752
That was beautiful.

15:59.691 --> 16:01.784
Which poet wrote that?

16:02.427 --> 16:03.655
Shakespeare.

16:08.300 --> 16:11.497
I can't imagine being home-schooled
and never seeing anybody.

16:12.237 --> 16:14.102
You don't miss what you never had.

16:21.213 --> 16:24.273
Seems like you don't get out much.
Are your parents pretty strict?

16:24.850 --> 16:27.478
They only want what's best for me.

16:30.288 --> 16:33.018
Oh, my God.
That's our milk delivery.

16:33.191 --> 16:35.489
- What time is it?
- Quarter to five.

16:35.794 --> 16:37.887
If my parents wake up...

16:47.672 --> 16:50.004
Do you want us to tell
your parents what happened?

16:50.175 --> 16:51.904
No, I'll be fine.

16:56.915 --> 16:59.611
Byron, hurry!

17:00.519 --> 17:02.043
I warned you not to leave, boy.

17:06.424 --> 17:08.517
No! No!

17:09.327 --> 17:10.954
Byron!

17:11.229 --> 17:13.288
- Go away!
- Come on!

17:14.098 --> 17:16.727
I'd better not catch you
around my son again!

17:18.703 --> 17:21.103
Get out before I shoot you
for trespassing!

17:34.386 --> 17:38.618
- Lionel Luthor offered you a job?
- I was just as surprised as you are.

17:38.790 --> 17:43.227
- What'd you tell him?
- That I wanted to discuss it with you.

17:49.100 --> 17:52.934
You know I've been thinking
about going back to work for a while.

17:53.104 --> 17:56.301
Why with him? You know
he's got an ulterior motive for everything.

17:56.474 --> 18:00.069
I know all about Lionel Luthor,
but we could use the money.

18:00.245 --> 18:03.681
And I could use
a bigger challenge in my life.

18:03.848 --> 18:07.340
Oh, I understand. Farm life's gotten
a little too boring for you, hasn't it?

18:07.519 --> 18:09.680
I didn't mean it like that.

18:10.221 --> 18:13.156
This is a chance for me
to put my education to use.

18:13.325 --> 18:15.759
Even at the risk of losing
our privacy here?

18:15.994 --> 18:17.723
You don't trust me to make that call?

18:19.030 --> 18:20.258
I want to do this.

18:21.399 --> 18:22.491
Martha...

18:26.972 --> 18:28.701
Clark?

18:29.040 --> 18:31.065
Lana, you two been out all night?

18:31.610 --> 18:33.601
No, it's not what you think.

18:35.680 --> 18:38.410
We met this kid and we think
his parents are abusing him.

19:08.813 --> 19:10.474
Mrs. Moore?

19:12.550 --> 19:15.314
I'm sorry to disturb you,
but I'd like to speak to your son.

19:16.254 --> 19:19.121
- I'm afraid that's not possible, sheriff.
- Where is he?

19:19.824 --> 19:22.622
Clark, let the sheriff handle this, please.

19:22.994 --> 19:24.222
He's not in any trouble.

19:25.363 --> 19:28.298
Look, I don't know what the hell's
going on here, sheriff...

19:28.466 --> 19:30.058
...but our son is dead.

19:31.870 --> 19:35.328
He drowned out
in Crater Lake eight years ago.

19:36.441 --> 19:38.170
We just met him last night.

19:38.410 --> 19:40.469
My son says that you threatened him.

19:40.645 --> 19:43.341
I've never seen
these kids before in my life.

19:44.082 --> 19:46.983
Look, it's taken all these years
to get past this...

19:47.152 --> 19:50.451
...and then you show up
and pull a prank like this.

19:50.622 --> 19:55.389
What kind of parent would raise a child
to do a wicked thing like that?

19:55.560 --> 19:59.223
We're awfully sorry.
Look, Jonathan, I think we should go.

20:03.168 --> 20:05.636
- They're lying.
- We saw him go in that house.

20:05.837 --> 20:09.068
- This is a very awkward situation.
- I know it is, Ethan.

20:09.240 --> 20:13.438
But if that young man's in trouble,
we wouldn't want that on our conscience.

20:14.379 --> 20:16.404
I'll get a warrant.

20:37.402 --> 20:41.498
It looks like your tortured artist is
a member of the dead poets society.

20:41.673 --> 20:44.267
The certificate of death was signed
by Dr. Emil Jenkins.

20:44.442 --> 20:45.807
It's gotta be fake.

20:45.977 --> 20:50.414
Not that I don't trust your judgment,
but could it be possible that goth boy is...?

20:50.582 --> 20:54.484
I don't think a ghost could polish off
three pieces of cake and two cappuccinos.

20:55.854 --> 20:58.345
I was just checking.
I mean, this is Smallville.

20:58.523 --> 21:02.653
I ran Dr. Jenkins' name through the
computer and found something interesting.

21:02.827 --> 21:07.287
Eight years ago, he supervised a medical
trial over at Metron Pharmaceuticals.

21:07.465 --> 21:09.228
Let me guess, Byron was a participant.

21:09.400 --> 21:13.234
Yeah, they were all kids who
had exhibited antisocial behavior.

21:13.404 --> 21:15.770
But that doesn't sound like Byron,
he's so gentle.

21:15.940 --> 21:19.899
Could it be that our new Shakespeare has
stirred the heart of our young Juliet?

21:20.078 --> 21:25.175
It's nice to meet someone so honest,
I don't have to guess what they're thinking.

21:25.350 --> 21:29.184
- We have to start looking for Byron.
- No, we should see what the sheriff finds.

21:36.661 --> 21:42.031
Chopin? I always thought you found him
to be too sentimental.

21:42.200 --> 21:47.160
No, Lex, I find that he
sometimes lacks subtlety.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.698
Sometimes.

21:50.241 --> 21:53.768
I take it from your tone
you're angry with me.

21:53.945 --> 21:56.140
What transgression
have I committed now?

21:56.314 --> 21:59.306
I wasted yesterday
interviewing more prospects...

21:59.484 --> 22:02.419
...only to find you've hired Mrs. Kent.

22:02.620 --> 22:05.453
- What's your angle, Dad?
- Angle?

22:05.623 --> 22:10.424
Martha Kent is a very capable woman.

22:10.595 --> 22:13.325
Unshakable honesty like hers...

22:13.498 --> 22:15.557
...it's hard to come by.

22:15.767 --> 22:19.635
She just happens to be one of the few
pillars of this community who could...

22:19.804 --> 22:24.434
...ingratiate a despised tycoon
to the citizens of Smallville.

22:24.609 --> 22:27.237
I hadn't thought of it in those terms.

22:27.412 --> 22:30.142
I suppose that is an unexpected benefit.

22:30.315 --> 22:32.909
I don't know what your sudden interest is
in the Kents...

22:33.084 --> 22:36.053
...but I want you to stay away from them.
They mean a lot to me.

22:36.921 --> 22:41.881
And I wonder what they would think
of your trying to meddle in their affairs.

22:42.060 --> 22:46.895
You think if you're a very good boy,
they'll welcome you into their family?

22:47.232 --> 22:50.861
Well, it would certainly be a step up.

22:53.438 --> 22:56.339
You know, Lex, Zeus had a son...

22:56.507 --> 23:02.446
...an adopted son, who thought
he could find a home among mortals.

23:02.614 --> 23:05.549
You know what happened
to the well-intentioned Prometheus?

23:06.050 --> 23:10.680
His dad had him chained to a rock
and his liver was eaten by vultures. Why?

23:11.089 --> 23:13.717
Prometheus was immortal, Lex.

23:13.892 --> 23:17.191
No matter how much he wanted
to escape the world he was born into...

23:17.362 --> 23:20.297
...the world of the gods, he
never could. It wasn't possible.

23:20.465 --> 23:23.525
If I find out that you have any agenda
that could hurt the Kents...

23:23.701 --> 23:26.761
...this amiable father-son detente
will come to an abrupt end.

23:55.033 --> 23:56.933
What happened to waiting
for the sheriff?

23:57.101 --> 23:59.797
I need to know if Byron's in here.

24:10.715 --> 24:13.843
You're a regular Dr. Doolittle.

24:25.997 --> 24:28.989
This place is like an NRA petting zoo.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.572
There's something under this rug.

24:43.748 --> 24:46.216
It's lead, that's why
I couldn't see through it.

24:46.384 --> 24:50.218
That's good to know. You ought to think
about publishing an instruction manual.

24:50.388 --> 24:52.481
Watch the door.

25:08.006 --> 25:11.373
Byron, what did they do to you?

25:12.010 --> 25:13.568
It's not what you think.

25:14.712 --> 25:16.509
I have to get you out of here.

25:19.784 --> 25:22.878
- How did you do that?
- Rusty lock. Come on!

25:23.054 --> 25:25.716
Don't! Last time I went out
during the day, I hurt my dad!

25:25.890 --> 25:27.824
No one deserves
to be locked up like this.

25:27.992 --> 25:29.220
You don't understand!

25:29.394 --> 25:32.488
Trust me, Byron.
I understand more than you know.

25:34.298 --> 25:35.993
No!

25:36.167 --> 25:38.192
Leave me alone!

25:47.612 --> 25:49.204
Byron, you okay?

25:50.815 --> 25:52.612
You should have listened to me.

26:02.794 --> 26:04.386
What are you looking at?

26:04.695 --> 26:06.890
- Byron, it's okay.
- Get away from me!

26:21.012 --> 26:22.741
Pete?

26:34.758 --> 26:38.558
Pete, I saw your mom downstairs,
are you all right?

26:38.796 --> 26:40.195
Yeah.

26:40.397 --> 26:42.991
The doctors say
it's a hairline fracture...

26:43.167 --> 26:46.933
...which is ironic because it hurts
everywhere else except my hairline.

26:47.104 --> 26:48.594
Oh, sweetie.

26:50.007 --> 26:53.465
Being part of this family should come
with its own group health insurance.

26:54.244 --> 26:57.042
I thought we agreed you were gonna
wait for Sheriff Ethan.

26:57.214 --> 27:00.240
Dad, they had Byron locked in
the basement, chained to the wall.

27:00.417 --> 27:03.147
When Clark carried him out,
he went Jekyll and Hyde on us.

27:03.320 --> 27:06.016
- I tried to stop him.
- You tried?

27:07.758 --> 27:10.420
How big of a change
are we talking about here?

27:10.961 --> 27:13.486
You really shouldn't be here.

27:13.664 --> 27:18.431
My husband is out looking for Byron,
but he'll be back soon.

27:18.602 --> 27:20.866
My son feels responsible.

27:21.572 --> 27:23.540
We want to help.

27:23.707 --> 27:24.731
You just...

27:24.908 --> 27:28.742
You can't imagine how hard it was
for both of us.

27:29.279 --> 27:32.180
You probably think we're
horrible parents.

27:37.554 --> 27:41.285
When I took Byron out into the light,
why did he change?

27:42.826 --> 27:45.317
It was one of the side effects
of the drug.

27:45.496 --> 27:47.521
He can't be out in the sun.

27:48.232 --> 27:50.757
I wish we'd never gotten
involved in that mess.

27:51.235 --> 27:53.362
They promised...

27:53.904 --> 27:56.702
...that the drug
would make him better...

27:56.874 --> 27:58.205
...would make him normal.

27:58.475 --> 28:01.911
There's gotta be somebody somewhere
that can help your son.

28:02.079 --> 28:04.047
We tried everything.

28:04.214 --> 28:08.014
Dr. Jenkins watched six other boys die...

28:08.185 --> 28:10.847
...trying to reverse the side effects.

28:11.155 --> 28:13.988
They had Byron hooked up
to all those machines...

28:15.059 --> 28:16.924
...like he was some sort of alien.

28:19.196 --> 28:21.221
Is that why you faked
his death certificate?

28:21.832 --> 28:24.130
We didn't know what to do.

28:24.535 --> 28:26.628
Finally, we locked him
in the cellar.

28:27.638 --> 28:31.404
He cried, for days.
He didn't understand...

28:31.942 --> 28:34.274
...why we had to keep him down here.

28:35.079 --> 28:38.048
We felt like the monsters.

28:39.349 --> 28:43.012
If I get Byron out of the sun,
will he change back?

28:43.987 --> 28:45.181
Yeah.

28:45.355 --> 28:49.348
He's so strong now,
I don't know how anybody could do that.

29:00.838 --> 29:05.673
I just got back from seeing Pete. He told
me what happened. Thanks for the call.

29:05.843 --> 29:08.676
- Look, Lana, l...
- Why did you lie to me, Clark?

29:08.846 --> 29:11.406
Byron's my friend, and I wanted to help.
You cut me out.

29:11.615 --> 29:15.278
- I didn't want you to get hurt.
- Is that it, or don't you trust me?

29:19.590 --> 29:22.491
- You haven't seen Byron, have you?
- No.

29:22.659 --> 29:25.787
But if I had, you'd know already.
I'd have been honest with you.

29:25.963 --> 29:30.332
Okay, I think I figured out why our would-be
Shakespeare went all pro-wrestler on you.

29:33.203 --> 29:35.535
Jeez, is it just me,
or did it get cold in here?

29:37.508 --> 29:38.736
What'd you find?

29:38.976 --> 29:43.811
The drug that Byron was given during the
medical trials targeted his adrenal system.

29:44.081 --> 29:47.414
It says they were looking for a cure.
We need to track down the company.

29:47.584 --> 29:51.213
It's too late. Metron was shut down
before they even finished their research.

29:51.388 --> 29:52.855
Why would they do that?

29:53.023 --> 29:55.753
I don't know. Maybe Clark
should ask his mom's new boss.

29:57.194 --> 29:58.889
Lionel Luthor owns Metron.

29:59.096 --> 30:03.396
Just one of the many LuthorCorp
subsidiaries that promises a brighter future.

30:03.567 --> 30:04.864
I'll talk to Lex.

30:05.135 --> 30:10.573
I'd love to help you, but Pete just sent out
an SOS for his PlayStation 2, so good luck.

30:14.211 --> 30:16.145
- Where are you going?
- To look for Byron.

30:16.313 --> 30:20.147
Wait, Lana. My dad, Mr. Moore and half
the sheriff's department are out searching.

30:20.317 --> 30:23.946
- So I should just stay here and pour coffee?
- I'm saying you should be careful.

30:24.121 --> 30:27.579
Byron's not the same guy.
If you see him, don't get too close.

30:28.525 --> 30:30.459
Call someone.

30:53.116 --> 30:54.845
Byron.

30:56.520 --> 30:58.954
It's me, Lana.
I want to help you.

31:04.428 --> 31:07.625
I was down there for eight years,
I'm not going back.

31:08.232 --> 31:11.724
You could hurt people like this.
The Byron I met wouldn't want that.

31:12.803 --> 31:14.930
I know who did this to you.
It was LuthorCorp.

31:15.105 --> 31:17.801
Clark's talking to Luthor's son.
They can find a cure.

31:17.975 --> 31:19.670
There is no cure!

31:20.043 --> 31:22.637
- Byron, no!
- I want you!

31:26.950 --> 31:29.817
They made me into someone
no one can love.

31:30.754 --> 31:32.278
Not even you!

31:43.800 --> 31:46.064
Another mark on the Luthor name.

31:47.938 --> 31:50.133
My father's leaving me quite a legacy.

31:51.808 --> 31:53.537
You might give your mom a heads up.

31:53.710 --> 31:57.043
If she's gonna work for my father,
this is what she's getting into.

31:57.214 --> 31:59.148
My mother can take care of herself, Lex.

32:00.317 --> 32:03.218
Besides, I haven't seen her
this excited in a long time.

32:03.654 --> 32:06.885
To tell you the truth, Clark,
I was a little surprised...

32:07.057 --> 32:10.254
...considering my offers to ease
your family's financial situation...

32:10.427 --> 32:12.827
...have been
met with a resounding no...

32:12.996 --> 32:15.897
...it stung a little to see her name
on my father's payroll.

32:16.066 --> 32:20.230
Well, to be honest, it wasn't exactly a
unanimous decision at the Kent household.

32:20.404 --> 32:23.237
My father's the poster boy
for family strife.

32:23.407 --> 32:25.466
I'm sorry it's spreading.

32:25.642 --> 32:29.203
Look at it this way, Lex, at least
my father's not upset with you this time.

32:29.379 --> 32:32.940
I'll look into Metron, see where my
father's hiding the proverbial bodies.

32:33.116 --> 32:38.144
Now, I have to head over to the plant. Some
Luthors actually have to work for a living.

32:44.361 --> 32:47.558
Wow, I didn't realize the traffic
in Smallville had gotten so bad.

32:47.731 --> 32:51.030
It's my father.
I hope your mom likes helicopters.

32:51.201 --> 32:52.964
My family doesn't fly much.

32:53.136 --> 32:56.594
Trust me, that's about to change.

32:56.974 --> 32:58.669
I'll talk to you later, Clark.

33:09.086 --> 33:11.145
Watch your head.

33:12.422 --> 33:13.980
All right!

33:17.794 --> 33:19.853
- It's this one here.
- What?

33:20.030 --> 33:21.019
This one.

33:21.498 --> 33:24.058
First time in a helicopter, Martha?

33:24.234 --> 33:27.203
I wasn't expecting a trip to Metropolis
on my first day.

33:27.671 --> 33:29.866
All right, Bob, we're off!

33:30.040 --> 33:31.302
Yes, sir.

33:40.917 --> 33:43.784
- What's happening, Bob?
- I don't know!

33:49.493 --> 33:51.085
What's happening?

33:51.428 --> 33:52.486
Bob?

34:08.712 --> 34:10.304
Oh, my God!

34:27.030 --> 34:29.328
- What is it?
- We have to get out of here! Come on!

34:29.498 --> 34:30.487
Martha!

34:36.239 --> 34:37.706
- Luthor!
- Who the hell are you?

34:37.873 --> 34:39.569
Oh, no!

34:42.545 --> 34:43.978
You did this to me!

34:50.887 --> 34:52.911
Did what?

34:53.090 --> 34:54.580
What are you talking about?

35:03.800 --> 35:06.166
I don't want to have to hurt you, Byron.

35:06.336 --> 35:10.329
- We gotta get you out of the light.
- No! You can't stop me!

35:13.643 --> 35:14.871
Clark!

35:54.751 --> 35:55.979
Clark?

35:57.554 --> 35:59.579
It's okay, Byron.

35:59.756 --> 36:01.348
You're gonna be all right.

36:18.775 --> 36:20.367
Clark.

36:21.344 --> 36:23.175
Hey, I brought you some light reading.

36:25.982 --> 36:27.347
They're a lost art form.

36:29.452 --> 36:33.889
I don't remember our fight,
but I cannot believe I didn't hurt you.

36:35.892 --> 36:37.416
Some people are just lucky.

36:39.896 --> 36:44.196
- Hey, how's the wrist?
- It'll be better in a couple of days.

36:45.035 --> 36:49.734
- I can't believe l...
- Hey, don't worry about it.

36:49.906 --> 36:51.134
I know it wasn't you.

36:52.709 --> 36:55.143
You were brave to come and find me.

36:55.312 --> 36:59.612
A friend warned me to be careful.
I should have listened to him.

37:04.187 --> 37:05.950
Let me see your hand.

37:32.949 --> 37:37.249
- Dad, I heard what happened. Are you okay?
- I'm relatively unscathed...

37:37.420 --> 37:39.980
...thanks to Martha and Clark.

37:40.523 --> 37:41.785
Clark?

37:43.059 --> 37:46.460
He's a rather extraordinary young man,
don't you think?

37:48.565 --> 37:51.398
Hi, Lex. I spoke to the foundation...

37:51.568 --> 37:54.128
...and they can transfer the funds
into the new account.

37:55.572 --> 37:59.838
Seven hours on the clock, and you're
already laundering money for my father?

38:00.010 --> 38:05.346
I'm convincing him to fund new research
into Byron Moore's condition. You okay?

38:06.216 --> 38:09.652
I'm sure my father informed you
LuthorCorp is not in the charity business.

38:09.853 --> 38:11.821
I did, I did.

38:11.988 --> 38:15.651
Then I explained that he'll spend less
helping this boy live a normal life...

38:15.825 --> 38:20.421
...than he would on advertising to restore
consumer confidence in LuthorCorp.

38:20.964 --> 38:23.558
The papers will be here tomorrow
for you to sign.

38:24.100 --> 38:25.692
- See you in the morning.
- All right.

38:33.343 --> 38:34.833
Lex...

38:35.412 --> 38:38.176
...I can feel your smirk from here.

38:39.482 --> 38:40.847
Better watch it, Dad...

38:41.017 --> 38:44.646
...or your new executive assistant
might start rearranging all your priorities.

38:52.495 --> 38:56.431
You pulled one of your trademark
disappearing acts last night.

38:56.766 --> 39:00.463
I figured you could use
some time alone with Byron.

39:06.676 --> 39:10.476
Sonnets? Not exactly your usual reading.

39:10.680 --> 39:13.740
Byron was really into them.
I thought maybe I could learn something.

39:17.987 --> 39:19.682
What'd you think?

39:21.391 --> 39:23.586
They really weren't for me.

39:24.527 --> 39:28.156
An honest answer. I like that.

39:28.631 --> 39:32.897
I'm sorry for not being straight with you
from the beginning.

39:33.069 --> 39:34.502
It's okay.

39:35.872 --> 39:39.467
When I confronted Byron,
I got so scared.

39:39.642 --> 39:42.110
First person I thought of was you.

39:42.379 --> 39:43.607
Really?

39:43.780 --> 39:48.114
I thought, "If Clark was here,
he'd know what to do."

39:49.352 --> 39:54.085
Thought I could save him.
I just ended up making things worse.

39:55.925 --> 39:58.917
You were trying to help a friend,
there's no harm in that.

39:59.662 --> 40:02.392
I hope Byron's gonna be okay.

40:04.567 --> 40:06.865
It doesn't bother you that he's so...?

40:07.203 --> 40:08.761
Different?

40:12.242 --> 40:15.803
If you really like someone,
you accept every part of them.

40:15.979 --> 40:20.541
But you can't do that until they're willing
to share every part with you.

40:23.987 --> 40:27.218
I think people like Byron...

40:27.891 --> 40:31.918
He keeps a part of himself hidden
so he doesn't scare people away.

40:32.796 --> 40:35.924
If you want to get close to someone,
you have to take that risk.

40:37.033 --> 40:39.831
What if the risk is too big to take?

40:42.205 --> 40:46.141
Then you might miss out on something
that could be pretty amazing.
