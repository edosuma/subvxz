WEBVTT

00:04.670 --> 00:06.476
John.

00:06.500 --> 00:07.766
Hey.
How are you?

00:07.790 --> 00:09.306
Great.
I was just, um...

00:09.330 --> 00:10.556
I haven't seen you.
Yeah, I know.

00:10.580 --> 00:11.896
I just was
swamped with work

00:11.920 --> 00:13.356
and, uh, the kitchen
renovation.

00:13.380 --> 00:15.016
How was your vacation
with Oliver?

00:15.040 --> 00:16.516
Great.
You know, we went to Utah,

00:16.540 --> 00:18.096
we hit all
the state parks.

00:18.120 --> 00:19.186
Oh, it's so beautiful
up there. Seriously.

00:19.210 --> 00:21.056
I mean, stunning.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.396
I've been thinking
about you.

00:22.420 --> 00:23.596
Really?
Yeah.

00:23.620 --> 00:25.356
Eh, would you be interested
in coming over

00:25.380 --> 00:27.306
and helping me test out
the new kitchen?

00:27.330 --> 00:28.596
You want me to
cook for you?

00:28.620 --> 00:30.396
I would cook.

00:30.420 --> 00:32.095
I wouldn't say no
to a-a co-pilot. Mm.

00:32.119 --> 00:34.146
My use of vegetables
has been described

00:34.170 --> 00:35.726
as a crime
against humanity.

00:35.750 --> 00:37.766
Kids can be so cruel.

00:37.790 --> 00:39.750
Sure.
I mean, I'd love to.

00:41.330 --> 00:42.806
Why
are you holding a towel?

00:42.830 --> 00:43.976
40-year-old male,

00:44.000 --> 00:45.516
traumatic amputation
of right hand

00:45.540 --> 00:46.766
in construction accident.

00:46.790 --> 00:49.686
BP 100/70, heart rate 110.

00:49.710 --> 00:52.596
Get him into Trauma Two,
page Ortho, and order an x-ray.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.556
Start an IV with
two liters of saline.

00:54.580 --> 00:56.356
John, is that the...

00:56.380 --> 00:58.596
Yes. Yeah,
that's his.

00:58.620 --> 01:00.096
Hey, um, what time?

01:00.120 --> 01:02.476
Uh, 7:00?
It's a date.

01:21.120 --> 01:22.686
So, what are you
gonna cook her?

01:22.710 --> 01:25.806
Couple of big-ass steaks
and a lovely baked potato.

01:25.830 --> 01:26.807
What?

01:26.831 --> 01:28.096
You know we're in L.A.?

01:28.120 --> 01:29.396
She's at least
a pescatarian.

01:29.420 --> 01:30.896
And she definitely
doesn't eat carbs.

01:30.920 --> 01:32.856
So, no potato?
Your safest bet

01:32.880 --> 01:35.596
is a kale salad with
a nice piece of salmon.

01:35.620 --> 01:37.266
Man, food used to be
so easy.

01:37.290 --> 01:39.056
There was only two kinds...
Fried and other.

01:39.080 --> 01:40.686
Okay, Grandpa.
Nolan.

01:40.710 --> 01:42.396
There's a lawyer looking
for you at the front desk.

01:42.420 --> 01:44.080
Uh-oh.
What'd you do?

01:47.880 --> 01:50.226
Are you John Nolan?
That depends on...

01:50.250 --> 01:51.726
Are you here to
serve me with a subpoena?

01:51.750 --> 01:54.686
No. I'm a trust and estates
lawyer. Susan Banker.

01:54.710 --> 01:56.476
I'm here to inform you about
what your father left you in his will.

01:56.500 --> 01:58.646
What... Wait.

01:58.670 --> 02:00.266
My father's dead?
Yes.

02:00.290 --> 02:01.396
I'm sorry.
Did no one tell you that?

02:01.420 --> 02:04.726
I haven't spoken to
my father in 35 years.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.766
He left me something
in his will?

02:06.790 --> 02:07.896
Was it a lot of something?

02:07.920 --> 02:09.856
$14 and his 1971 Chevelle.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.186
You're kidding. No.
There's the check.

02:12.210 --> 02:13.306
The car will be
delivered later today.

02:13.330 --> 02:14.556
And what if I don't
want the car?

02:14.580 --> 02:15.686
Then get rid of it.

02:15.710 --> 02:17.686
Just sign the bottom...

02:17.710 --> 02:19.646
Confirming your
receipt of the check.

02:19.670 --> 02:21.096
Eh, how did he die?

02:21.120 --> 02:23.356
Heart attack.
Or drowning.

02:23.380 --> 02:25.436
He was in the pool at his house
in Tempe when it hit.

02:25.460 --> 02:26.750
I'm sorry.

02:29.710 --> 02:31.436
What's going on?

02:31.460 --> 02:34.476
We're celebrating Smitty's
last day as Mr. Irrelevant.

02:34.500 --> 02:36.856
The sergeants exam happens
once every two years.

02:36.880 --> 02:39.476
Whoever scores the lowest
gets called Mr. Irrelevant

02:39.500 --> 02:41.596
'cause they got no chance
at getting promoted.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.556
So, if this is Smitty's
swan song,

02:43.580 --> 02:45.476
that means the new scores
are gonna be posted soon.

02:45.500 --> 02:47.806
Tonight.
That's exciting.

02:47.830 --> 02:49.436
You're gonna do great.
No doubt.

02:52.460 --> 02:54.056
Hey.

02:54.080 --> 02:56.146
You alright?

02:56.170 --> 02:57.936
My dad died.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.936
I'm so sorry.
Are... Are you okay?

02:59.960 --> 03:01.226
Yeah.

03:01.250 --> 03:03.766
I honestly
never knew the man.

03:03.790 --> 03:05.436
It's just a little
unexpected.

03:05.460 --> 03:07.146
Alright.
Well, if you need anything...

03:07.170 --> 03:08.596
Nah. I'm fine.

03:08.620 --> 03:10.766
Honestly.
I'm good. Thank you.

03:10.790 --> 03:13.396
Alright. Party's over.

03:13.420 --> 03:15.856
So, Officer Smitty...
These past two years,

03:15.880 --> 03:17.806
you have handled
your irrelevance

03:17.830 --> 03:19.896
with the poise and dignity
I expect

03:19.920 --> 03:23.016
from a man of...
Of little ambition.

03:23.040 --> 03:26.356
Thank you, sir.

03:26.380 --> 03:27.646
To business.

03:27.670 --> 03:28.976
Today is Follow-Up Day.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.976
Detectives have several cases

03:31.000 --> 03:33.226
that are on the edge
of being back-burnered.

03:33.250 --> 03:34.806
You're gonna take the day

03:34.830 --> 03:36.806
to see if you can breathe
new life into them.

03:36.830 --> 03:38.396
So, Bradford and Chen,

03:38.420 --> 03:41.396
you have a three-day-old
home invasion.

03:41.420 --> 03:44.146
The victim is a former
gang member, Nevin Cooper.

03:44.170 --> 03:45.936
No forensics, no suspects.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.476
We're on it, sir.

03:47.500 --> 03:50.306
Lopez and West,
you're going to Hancock Park.

03:50.330 --> 03:53.306
A statue was stolen from
a homeowner's front yard.

03:53.330 --> 03:54.856
It looks like a giant
turd.

03:54.880 --> 03:56.226
Well, that "turd" is worth
a half a million,

03:56.250 --> 03:58.306
so track it down.
Yes, sir.

03:58.330 --> 04:00.976
Which brings me to
Harper and Nolan.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.146
Actually, sir,
Robbery Homicide requested

04:03.170 --> 04:06.396
that Officer Nolan and I
follow up on one of their cases.

04:06.420 --> 04:08.856
And how much did you pay
for them to request that?

04:08.880 --> 04:10.686
That's a very cynical
question, sir.

04:10.710 --> 04:12.726
Seems fair to me.

04:12.750 --> 04:14.500
What do you think,
Officer Nolan?

04:16.709 --> 04:18.329
What?

04:20.250 --> 04:21.596
On it.
Yes, sir.

04:25.080 --> 04:27.646
Hey, you sure
you're alright?

04:27.670 --> 04:29.856
There's no shame in
taking a personal day.

04:29.880 --> 04:31.356
Oh.
Yeah, I know.

04:31.380 --> 04:33.266
Uh, just seemed so disingenuous,
you know?

04:33.290 --> 04:34.936
Last time I saw my dad,
I was ten.

04:34.960 --> 04:38.056
He was driving away
in that Chevelle.

04:38.080 --> 04:40.266
The car he left me.

04:40.290 --> 04:42.146
Sounds like the plot of
a bad first novel.

04:42.170 --> 04:44.330
No offense.
No. No, you're not wrong.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.896
Hey, listen.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.896
It's one thing to lose focus
during roll call,

04:49.920 --> 04:52.806
but out here, you get
distracted, you get killed.

04:52.830 --> 04:54.476
So I need you sharp.

04:54.500 --> 04:55.646
I am.

04:55.670 --> 04:57.250
I will be.

04:59.040 --> 05:01.896
We're closed.

05:01.920 --> 05:03.596
Police.

05:03.620 --> 05:06.146
Uh, we're following up
for Detective Calderon.

05:06.170 --> 05:08.306
We're just checking in to see if
you've thought of anything new

05:08.330 --> 05:09.896
that might help us
catch the guy

05:09.920 --> 05:11.976
who robbed you
and killed your wife.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.186
No. He came inside
and hit me right away.

05:15.210 --> 05:18.556
I couldn't do anything
to stop him.

05:18.580 --> 05:20.516
To save her.

05:20.540 --> 05:23.396
Sir, we're very sorry
for your loss.

05:23.420 --> 05:25.266
You told detectives the man
was wearing a mask?

05:25.290 --> 05:26.686
Yes.

05:26.710 --> 05:28.186
And he took several
hundred dollars

05:28.210 --> 05:29.936
from the register
and a case of whiskey?

05:29.960 --> 05:31.710
Well, another thing.

05:33.790 --> 05:35.646
I didn't notice it
until this morning

05:35.670 --> 05:37.096
when I started to clean,

05:37.120 --> 05:39.056
but there was a new roll
of scratchers

05:39.080 --> 05:40.766
under the counter.

05:40.790 --> 05:42.306
They're not there now.
He must have taken them.

05:42.330 --> 05:43.766
Scratch-off
lottery tickets?

05:43.790 --> 05:46.516
Yes.
Um... like these.

05:46.540 --> 05:49.226
High value.
500 tickets a roll.

05:49.250 --> 05:51.306
Did you report those
as stolen? An hour ago.

05:51.330 --> 05:52.726
That's how we're gonna
catch this guy.

05:52.750 --> 05:54.726
Uh, sir, the lottery office
will flag

05:54.750 --> 05:56.976
all the serial numbers
and cancel the tickets.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.686
If he tries to redeem a winner,
it'll get flagged.

05:59.710 --> 06:01.806
Good.
I hope you catch him.

06:01.830 --> 06:03.880
And I hope he gives you
a good reason to kill him.

06:04.830 --> 06:06.766
Sir.

06:06.790 --> 06:08.806
We will keep you posted.

06:08.830 --> 06:11.500
Uh, if anything else occurs
to you, just give us a call.

06:12.830 --> 06:16.080
Why did you stop me? It is
not our job to police his grief.

06:25.040 --> 06:27.146
Good morning, officers.
What can I get you?

06:27.170 --> 06:28.896
We're looking for
Nevin Cooper.

06:28.920 --> 06:31.096
Oh. He's a little
busy right now.

06:31.120 --> 06:32.356
Can I help you
with something?

06:39.880 --> 06:42.436
Hey, everything okay?

06:42.460 --> 06:43.806
Yeah.

06:43.830 --> 06:46.356
It's just some confusion
in our order.

06:46.380 --> 06:48.250
Sorry for
the misunderstanding.

06:51.210 --> 06:52.646
Marquel, right?

06:52.670 --> 06:54.436
I know you?

06:54.460 --> 06:56.766
I'm the guy who put
Keon in Pelican Bay.

06:56.790 --> 06:58.186
Heard you filled the void.

06:58.210 --> 06:59.976
Ah, what can I say?

07:00.000 --> 07:02.726
"Some are born great,
some achieve greatness,

07:02.750 --> 07:04.896
and some have greatness
thrust upon them."

07:04.920 --> 07:07.356
Shakespeare.
Play?

07:07.380 --> 07:08.596
"Twelfth Night."

07:08.620 --> 07:10.380
Smart for a cop.

07:12.210 --> 07:14.266
I read you weren't running
with these guys anymore, Nevin.

07:14.290 --> 07:16.146
Found a different path
in prison.

07:16.170 --> 07:18.186
Bitch binge-watched
too much British baking.

07:18.210 --> 07:20.516
Got himself rehabilitated.

07:20.540 --> 07:22.016
It's not every day
that you see a gang

07:22.040 --> 07:24.226
be so forgiving to someone
who's left the flock.

07:24.250 --> 07:25.896
That's inspiring.

07:25.920 --> 07:27.476
Unless you're here
to sweat him.

07:27.500 --> 07:29.096
You guys wouldn't happen
to know

07:29.120 --> 07:31.056
who broke into Nevin's house a
couple nights ago, tied him up?

07:31.080 --> 07:32.516
I sure don't.

07:32.540 --> 07:34.356
But I tell you what,
I hear anything,

07:34.380 --> 07:37.146
you will be my first call.

07:37.170 --> 07:38.646
I'll see you around,
Nevin.

07:44.920 --> 07:46.040
You alright?
Fine.

07:47.290 --> 07:49.476
Got a lot of work to do
and it's tight in here,

07:49.500 --> 07:51.936
so Sasha'll give you
some donuts on your way out.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.516
I know you're scared,
but we can help.

07:53.540 --> 07:55.686
I'm not scared. I'm busy.
I got things handled.

07:55.710 --> 07:57.896
Okay, so why call the cops
if you got it handled?

07:57.920 --> 08:00.476
I didn't. Let me
guess. Sasha did.

08:00.500 --> 08:01.960
Before you could
tell her not to?

08:05.000 --> 08:06.686
I appreciate
what you're trying to do...

08:06.710 --> 08:08.226
Turn your life around.

08:08.250 --> 08:09.806
I know it isn't easy.
It is what it is, man.

08:09.830 --> 08:11.976
You can't handle Marquel
and his crew on your own.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.306
I don't know what
you're talking about.

08:13.330 --> 08:16.306
They just came to
buy some pastries.

08:16.330 --> 08:17.880
Now I gotta get
back to work.

08:20.460 --> 08:23.120
Sure. You change your mind,
you know where to find us.

08:27.580 --> 08:29.396
Looks like that's
where the statue was.

08:29.420 --> 08:31.186
You're gonna make
a great detective.

08:33.419 --> 08:35.356
Why haven't you guys
found my statue yet?

08:35.380 --> 08:36.476
That's why we're here, sir...

08:36.500 --> 08:37.806
To see if you have
any new information.

08:37.830 --> 08:39.596
If I have any
new information?

08:39.620 --> 08:41.226
This is your job.

08:41.250 --> 08:43.186
I've been calling you
every day.

08:43.210 --> 08:44.936
Yes, sir, we're aware.
That's why we're here.

08:44.960 --> 08:46.436
Did they find it?

08:46.460 --> 08:47.460
No.

08:48.500 --> 08:51.016
Ma'am, I read over
the initial police report.

08:51.040 --> 08:52.266
What exactly did you mean
when you said

08:52.290 --> 08:55.226
that whoever took it
should get a reward?

08:55.250 --> 08:58.646
What the hell?
I did not say that.

08:58.670 --> 09:00.056
Did I?
Mrs. Nithercott,

09:00.080 --> 09:01.556
did you have anything to do

09:01.580 --> 09:02.646
with the disappearance
of the statue?

09:02.670 --> 09:05.016
Of course not.

09:05.040 --> 09:08.896
No, uh, just I'm not as sad
as Roger is that it's gone.

09:08.920 --> 09:11.146
What are you saying?
I thought you loved that piece.

09:11.170 --> 09:15.306
It looks like a dinosaur copped
a squat on our front yard.

09:15.330 --> 09:18.436
I bought it because it
reminded me of our honeymoon.

09:18.460 --> 09:20.420
How does that remind you
of your honeymoon?

09:21.790 --> 09:23.266
Maybe I don't want to know.

09:23.290 --> 09:24.686
Look, you wanna
find the thief?

09:24.710 --> 09:27.476
Talk to the members of
the homeowners association.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.020
They hated that thing
as much as I did.

09:30.710 --> 09:33.356
You ever play the lottery?

09:33.380 --> 09:36.436
Only when the jackpot
goes to a billion. You?

09:36.460 --> 09:39.146
Every week for 20 years
when I lived back in Foxburg.

09:39.170 --> 09:40.726
Buy a ticket at
the gas station

09:40.750 --> 09:42.186
on the way home
on a Friday night,

09:42.210 --> 09:43.936
spend the time it took me
to fill my tank

09:43.960 --> 09:45.806
just fantasizing
what I would do with the money.

09:45.830 --> 09:47.436
And?

09:47.460 --> 09:50.016
Mostly I would just think
about what life would be like

09:50.040 --> 09:51.476
if I never had to worry
about money again.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.556
Oh, yeah.
That would be nice.

09:53.580 --> 09:55.806
I can barely see the edge
of the hole I'm in.

09:55.830 --> 09:57.766
7-Adam-15,
give the bridge a call.

09:59.380 --> 10:02.726
Yeah, this is Officer Nolan.
I was asked to call.

10:02.750 --> 10:04.806
Right.
Thank you.

10:06.080 --> 10:07.580
My inheritance
has arrived.

10:13.670 --> 10:15.646
Hey.
Hey.

10:15.670 --> 10:17.396
Nice car.
It's a classic.

10:17.420 --> 10:20.306
Yeah. It has a matching
350 four-barrel

10:20.330 --> 10:22.306
with an original turbo trans.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.016
You drive it all the way
in from Arizona?

10:24.040 --> 10:26.726
No. No, I, uh... I actually
drove it to New York

10:26.750 --> 10:28.306
and then I got
on a cargo ship

10:28.330 --> 10:29.970
and then we went
through the Panama Canal.

10:31.830 --> 10:34.266
No need to be
an ass about it.

10:34.290 --> 10:35.806
What do you think
I could get for it?

10:35.830 --> 10:37.436
I don't know, man.
W-What, you want to sell it?

10:37.460 --> 10:40.516
I don't know. The guy who
left it to me was bad news.

10:40.540 --> 10:43.056
Real piece of crap.

10:43.080 --> 10:44.306
Hey!
Don't talk about my dad!

10:44.330 --> 10:45.646
Hands behind your back!

10:45.670 --> 10:46.920
Ow!

10:48.920 --> 10:50.936
Your dad?

10:50.960 --> 10:52.266
That would make him...

10:52.290 --> 10:53.896
My brother.
Half-brother.

11:01.080 --> 11:03.726
Wait. Just wait.
Just... Just stop.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.516
What is your name?
Pete. Nolan.

11:06.540 --> 11:08.686
And your father was?
Charles.

11:08.710 --> 11:10.096
He had a beer belly,

11:10.120 --> 11:13.436
he had blue eyes,
a Marine Corps tattoo.

11:13.460 --> 11:15.806
I don't know, he liked to take
his teeth out at parties.

11:15.830 --> 11:16.856
He was quite a character!

11:16.880 --> 11:18.266
You got me on that last one.

11:18.290 --> 11:20.210
He was 35 when he abandoned
my mom and me.

11:21.830 --> 11:23.270
Alright, what do you
want to do here?

11:25.540 --> 11:26.896
Take off the cuffs.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.306
You're gonna let me go?
Yes.

11:28.330 --> 11:30.056
Are you sure?
'Cause the last cop I punched

11:30.080 --> 11:31.186
was not that cool
about it.

11:31.210 --> 11:33.016
How many cops
have you punched?

11:33.040 --> 11:34.556
Like, today,
or, like, ever?

11:35.750 --> 11:37.096
I'm kidding. One.

11:37.120 --> 11:39.516
Five.
I've punched five cops.

11:39.540 --> 11:42.686
Look... before today, I didn't
even know I had a brother.

11:42.710 --> 11:44.096
Half-brother, alright?

11:44.120 --> 11:46.056
And I was just as surprised
when the chick read the will

11:46.080 --> 11:47.017
and said that you
were getting the car.

11:47.041 --> 11:48.306
I don't know
why he did that.

11:48.330 --> 11:50.356
Yeah. I don't know
why he did that, either.

11:50.380 --> 11:53.766
Now, if I'm free to go,
uh, I'm gonna go.

11:53.790 --> 11:55.620
Back to Arizona, alright?

11:59.420 --> 12:02.856
Um... look, this has all
been a bit of a shock,

12:02.880 --> 12:06.306
but if you'd like to... wait
around till after my shift,

12:06.330 --> 12:08.186
I don't know,
maybe we could... What?

12:08.210 --> 12:09.516
Hang out
and get to know each other

12:09.540 --> 12:11.306
and become best friends?

12:11.330 --> 12:13.726
No. I'll pass.

12:13.750 --> 12:14.806
Enjoy the car.

12:14.830 --> 12:16.976
Nice meeting you.

12:19.250 --> 12:20.380
It's a push.

12:22.040 --> 12:23.380
Lunch?

12:25.290 --> 12:27.766
So, how does it work?
The sergeants exam?

12:27.790 --> 12:29.266
Do you get the stripe
right away?

12:29.290 --> 12:31.226
No. Passing the test
is the first step.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.096
You only get promoted
when a spot opens up.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.556
You're at the top of the list,
might take a month or two.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.146
The lower you are,
the longer it's gonna take.

12:37.170 --> 12:39.096
And for some,
they'll never get a shot.

12:39.120 --> 12:40.646
Be taking the test
again in two years.

12:40.670 --> 12:44.356
Hey. Your home invasion
victim was just assaulted.

12:44.380 --> 12:45.856
He's on his way to the ER.

12:45.880 --> 12:47.476
Nevin?
We just saw him.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.186
Yeah, Marquel must have
doubled back after we left.

12:49.210 --> 12:50.356
Is he hurt bad?

12:50.380 --> 12:52.016
Fractured right arm,
bruised ribs,

12:52.040 --> 12:53.726
couple of loose teeth.

12:53.750 --> 12:55.330
He's gonna be in pain
for a few weeks.

12:56.880 --> 12:58.686
Do you guys
know who did it?

12:58.710 --> 13:00.226
Yeah, but we can't
do anything about it

13:00.250 --> 13:02.096
unless Nevin makes
an official ID.

13:02.120 --> 13:03.686
Which he's not
going to do.

13:05.120 --> 13:06.290
But maybe
his girlfriend will.

13:08.670 --> 13:09.920
Good luck.

13:13.750 --> 13:15.516
How is he?

13:15.540 --> 13:16.766
He's tough.

13:16.790 --> 13:18.146
Didn't want me to call 911,

13:18.170 --> 13:19.936
even though the bone
was sticking out.

13:19.960 --> 13:22.356
I'm sorry.
That sounds upsetting.

13:22.380 --> 13:24.766
He's trying so hard to make up
for the things he did.

13:24.790 --> 13:26.356
Why can't they just
leave him alone?

13:26.380 --> 13:28.896
Because they're predators.
But we can help.

13:28.920 --> 13:31.556
How? He's here because you
came around this morning.

13:31.580 --> 13:33.766
Marquel had to make sure that
Nevin wasn't snitching.

13:33.790 --> 13:36.306
Snitching about what?

13:36.330 --> 13:38.356
No way.

13:38.380 --> 13:40.766
Sasha, you walk away,

13:40.790 --> 13:42.766
he ends up back
in prison or dead.

13:42.790 --> 13:44.976
Look, without us,
Nevin either gives in,

13:45.000 --> 13:46.266
gives Marquel
what he wants,

13:46.290 --> 13:48.306
or he doesn't
and Marquel kills him.

13:48.330 --> 13:51.096
We're his only hope
at a different outcome.

13:51.120 --> 13:53.016
You promise
you can protect him?

13:53.040 --> 13:55.266
I'd be lying
if I said yes,

13:55.290 --> 13:57.436
but he's got no chance
without us.

14:04.210 --> 14:06.096
Marquel wants Nevin
to launder drug money

14:06.120 --> 14:07.306
through the bakery.

14:07.330 --> 14:10.120
Said he had 24 hours
to decide.

14:12.040 --> 14:14.556
Now you know.

14:20.920 --> 14:23.726
So, what's the play?
Arrest Marquel for assault?

14:23.750 --> 14:25.806
No. We do that,

14:25.830 --> 14:27.686
and Marquel's guys will
kill Sasha and Nevin.

14:27.710 --> 14:29.556
Then what?

14:29.580 --> 14:31.556
I don't know.

14:31.580 --> 14:33.146
Neighbor says
she didn't witness the theft,

14:33.170 --> 14:35.516
but, quote, "That statue
was the real crime."

14:35.540 --> 14:37.146
And the woman I talked to
said that she wished

14:37.170 --> 14:38.726
she had the balls to steal
that thing years ago,

14:38.750 --> 14:40.056
and whoever took it

14:40.080 --> 14:41.646
should have a statue
erected in their honor.

14:41.670 --> 14:44.620
Alright. One more house
and I'm calling it.

14:46.210 --> 14:47.976
Police!

14:48.000 --> 14:49.710
There's a car
in the driveway.

14:52.670 --> 14:54.226
LAPD!

14:54.250 --> 14:56.040
We just have a few
questions for you.

14:58.080 --> 14:59.596
I guess we can
follow up tomorrow.

14:59.620 --> 15:01.016
Help!

15:01.040 --> 15:02.936
Did you hear that?

15:02.960 --> 15:04.960
Hear what?
Help!

15:06.290 --> 15:09.016
Help!

15:12.210 --> 15:13.750
Help!

15:15.080 --> 15:16.120
Help!

15:20.120 --> 15:22.266
Oh.

15:27.830 --> 15:30.356
Oh, God.
Oh! God!

15:30.380 --> 15:32.686
Think how I feel.
I've been lying in it.

15:32.710 --> 15:34.806
I have a brother.

15:34.830 --> 15:37.056
My father is dead,
and I have a brother.

15:37.080 --> 15:39.266
Yeah, we've been through
all of this at some length.

15:39.290 --> 15:41.056
I mean, yesterday,
I didn't have a brother,

15:41.080 --> 15:42.976
and today,
I have a brother.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.096
That is a serious shift
in the universe.

15:45.120 --> 15:47.896
Is it? Look, I mean,
real siblings are people

15:47.920 --> 15:50.266
that you share
your childhood with.

15:50.290 --> 15:52.056
That guy
shares some DNA.

15:52.080 --> 15:54.096
Doesn't make him
your brother.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.056
Got your suspect
in interrogation.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.516
Northeast Division caught her

15:57.540 --> 16:00.896
trying to cash in
one of the stolen scratchers

16:00.920 --> 16:02.436
at a 7-Eleven in Los Feliz.

16:02.460 --> 16:04.266
Her?

16:04.290 --> 16:05.766
Smitty, our killer

16:05.790 --> 16:08.306
is a six foot,
200-pound male.

16:08.330 --> 16:11.016
Well, she's none
of those things.

16:11.040 --> 16:12.856
I didn't know the scratcher
was stolen, okay?

16:12.880 --> 16:14.476
I swear.

16:14.500 --> 16:15.646
Where'd you get
the ticket?

16:15.670 --> 16:16.686
Work.

16:16.710 --> 16:17.896
And work is?

16:17.920 --> 16:19.186
The Red Angel.

16:19.210 --> 16:20.556
Strip club.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.226
You know, I've had some
pretty pathetic tips before,

16:22.250 --> 16:23.976
but this is the first one
that's landed me in jail.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.726
Relax.
You're not under arrest.

16:25.750 --> 16:28.016
We just need the name of the guy
who gave you the ticket.

16:28.040 --> 16:31.096
I don't know. From the stage,
it's just a sea of losers.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.766
No offense.
None taken.

16:32.790 --> 16:34.556
I don't really
frequent those.

16:34.580 --> 16:36.896
I mean, I've been.
I just don't make a habit of...

16:36.920 --> 16:38.516
Does the club
have cameras?

16:38.540 --> 16:40.766
Not officially.
That's a yes.

16:40.790 --> 16:42.726
I'll call the club and
get the footage sent over,

16:42.750 --> 16:45.436
and then you and Chastity
can go through every frame

16:45.460 --> 16:47.476
and find the guy
that tipped her the ticket.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.306
Together?

16:49.330 --> 16:51.476
As in she'll be watching me
as I watch her...

16:51.500 --> 16:53.686
As in...
you're solving a murder.

16:53.710 --> 16:55.120
Right.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.686
Stealing that statue
was a public service.

16:59.710 --> 17:01.396
That almost
got you killed.

17:01.420 --> 17:03.436
Still worth it.

17:03.460 --> 17:05.685
Angela. Excuse me.
Angela.

17:05.710 --> 17:07.226
Oh.

17:07.250 --> 17:08.856
Is this your station?

17:08.880 --> 17:10.266
What a funny
little world.

17:10.290 --> 17:11.435
Who's that?

17:11.460 --> 17:13.556
Wesley's mom.

17:13.579 --> 17:16.266
What's she in for?

17:16.290 --> 17:19.185
They found an unlicensed gun in
her car during a traffic stop.

17:29.420 --> 17:31.060
I'm about to do one of
my signature moves.

17:32.120 --> 17:33.896
How is that even possible?

17:33.920 --> 17:36.436
Uh, the key
is core strength,

17:36.460 --> 17:38.476
and pride
in my downstairs area.

17:38.500 --> 17:40.936
Well, it's well-earned.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.686
Thanks.

17:42.710 --> 17:43.896
Got somewhere else to be?

17:43.920 --> 17:46.056
No. I... Kind of.

17:46.080 --> 17:48.096
It's... I-I have a date.
It's not for a few hours.

17:48.120 --> 17:49.896
Oh, good for you.

17:49.920 --> 17:51.396
Dating is challenging,

17:51.420 --> 17:53.096
especially towards
the beginning.

17:53.120 --> 17:55.016
Well, this is, uh, an old
girlfriend, actually.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.396
Oh.

17:56.420 --> 17:57.516
Making what's old
new again.

17:57.540 --> 17:59.556
Yeah.

17:59.580 --> 18:01.516
Seem a little
nervous, though.

18:01.540 --> 18:03.976
Well, when... when we
were together before,

18:04.000 --> 18:05.896
it was, you know, magical.

18:05.920 --> 18:08.226
It just...
That was a long time ago.

18:08.250 --> 18:10.936
Have you talked to her
about your fears?

18:13.170 --> 18:14.646
No.
Men.

18:14.670 --> 18:16.096
You are incapable

18:16.120 --> 18:17.556
of communicating with someone
you care about,

18:17.580 --> 18:19.686
but have no problem
being explicit

18:19.710 --> 18:21.596
with some stranger in a thong.

18:22.920 --> 18:24.516
Oh.
Oh, there he is.

18:24.540 --> 18:26.226
Scratch-off guy.

18:26.250 --> 18:28.306
Right before we went
upstairs for a private.

18:28.330 --> 18:30.556
That is a nice,
clear image.

18:30.580 --> 18:32.726
We should be able to get a match
off facial recognition.

18:32.750 --> 18:36.226
So, I, like...
cracked the case?

18:36.250 --> 18:37.436
Yes, you did.

18:37.460 --> 18:38.556
Cool.

18:38.580 --> 18:40.306
I'll walk you out.

18:40.330 --> 18:42.516
Well, if you ever wanna
come by the club,

18:42.540 --> 18:44.936
I'll give you a free lap dance. Oh,
thanks. That's very sweet.

18:44.960 --> 18:47.016
We should probably just keep
this professional, though. Okay.

18:47.040 --> 18:48.146
Hey, man.

18:48.170 --> 18:50.356
Hey.
Hey, I, uh...

18:50.380 --> 18:51.766
I just want to say
sorry for earlier.

18:51.790 --> 18:54.016
I-I know things got a little
out of hand, you know?

18:54.040 --> 18:55.436
It's pretty normal
for me, but, uh,

18:55.460 --> 18:56.766
I know you don't know me
that well, so...

18:56.790 --> 18:59.016
You were going through
some stuff, so it's okay.

18:59.040 --> 19:00.646
Like I said,
I just, uh...

19:00.670 --> 19:03.516
I just wanted to
say sorry, and, uh...

19:03.540 --> 19:04.976
And I did, so...

19:05.000 --> 19:06.330
Alright.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.556
Hey.
Where are you staying?

19:10.580 --> 19:12.356
I'm renovating
a house on Beechwood.

19:12.380 --> 19:14.266
You're welcome to use
the guest room.

19:14.290 --> 19:16.646
Oh, it's okay, man. I'm staying
at the Starlight Motel.

19:16.670 --> 19:18.936
Plus, I gotta catch this bus to
Tempe in the morning, so...

19:18.960 --> 19:21.266
Oh. I love Tempe.
I did the, uh...

19:21.290 --> 19:22.976
The Ironman competition
there twice.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.226
Oh, cool.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.806
I've never been to the gym.

19:26.830 --> 19:28.806
Uh, Pete, this is Chastity.
Chastity, Pete.

19:28.830 --> 19:30.556
Hey.
Hello.

19:30.580 --> 19:34.356
Um... do you wanna, like,
go get, uh, sushi or something?

19:34.380 --> 19:35.766
Yeah. Okay.

19:35.790 --> 19:36.806
Yeah?
Yeah.

19:36.830 --> 19:39.096
Sick. Alright.

19:39.120 --> 19:40.976
Hey, man, uh... you think
I could have some money

19:41.000 --> 19:42.516
for that sushi date?

19:44.250 --> 19:45.380
Yeah.

19:48.500 --> 19:50.146
Thank you.

19:50.170 --> 19:52.056
It's... It's L.A. sushi.

19:55.670 --> 19:57.266
Don't worry about
paying me back. I won't.

19:57.290 --> 19:58.420
Have a good one.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.146
That was weird.
Me and him. Huh?

20:02.170 --> 20:05.766
Stay out of trouble.
If you can.

20:05.790 --> 20:08.596
This is serious.
They found a gun in your car.

20:08.620 --> 20:10.976
Well, you know how dangerous
this city can be.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.646
A woman has to be able
to protect herself.

20:12.670 --> 20:14.686
Mom, where did you
even get the gun?

20:14.710 --> 20:16.016
Christian.

20:16.040 --> 20:18.306
The... The tennis
instructor?

20:18.330 --> 20:20.356
Well, we're dating now.

20:20.380 --> 20:22.726
Don't say it.
I know what you're gonna say.

20:22.750 --> 20:24.436
He likes me for me.

20:24.460 --> 20:26.226
It's not my money.
Mom, come on.

20:26.250 --> 20:28.766
Don't tell Angela
about Christian, please.

20:28.790 --> 20:29.976
I don't want him
to get in trouble.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.380
Promise me, now.

20:33.420 --> 20:35.670
Yes. I promise.

20:37.380 --> 20:39.806
Lawrence.
Oh, how nice to see you.

20:39.830 --> 20:42.226
Patrice. Wesley.

20:42.250 --> 20:44.056
It's been far too long.
Uh-huh.

20:44.080 --> 20:45.096
You called
the family lawyer?

20:45.120 --> 20:47.016
I thought I was
gonna handle this.

20:47.040 --> 20:48.646
Oh. Oh, sweetie,
I love you,

20:48.670 --> 20:51.226
but you work above
an Ethiopian restaurant.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.806
And... you need
a "real" lawyer.

20:53.830 --> 20:55.580
I knew you'd understand.

20:59.210 --> 21:00.356
Well?

21:01.710 --> 21:03.436
My mom fired me.

21:03.460 --> 21:05.186
Ouch.
Mm.

21:05.210 --> 21:08.226
Did she say where
she got the gun?

21:08.250 --> 21:10.096
Yeah, but it's privileged.
I can't tell you.

21:10.120 --> 21:11.226
Well, she's got to
give the guy up.

21:11.250 --> 21:12.556
Ballistics came back.

21:12.580 --> 21:13.766
The gun in her car
was used

21:13.790 --> 21:15.476
in an armed robbery
six months ago.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.056
Homeowner was shot.

21:17.080 --> 21:19.096
She's looking at accessory
after the fact.

21:22.040 --> 21:23.896
Welcome.
Hi.

21:23.920 --> 21:25.436
Hi.

21:28.210 --> 21:30.186
Coat.

21:30.210 --> 21:32.476
Something to drink?

21:32.500 --> 21:34.306
Sure.

21:34.330 --> 21:35.646
Your place looks great.

21:35.670 --> 21:36.766
Oh, thank you.

21:38.460 --> 21:39.726
Hope you like white.

21:39.750 --> 21:41.056
Did someone punch you?

21:41.080 --> 21:44.146
Yes.
Um... I have had a day.

21:44.170 --> 21:45.476
Do you want to
talk about it?

21:45.500 --> 21:46.856
If I start
talking about it,

21:46.880 --> 21:48.226
the whole night's
gonna be about that,

21:48.250 --> 21:50.436
and I want tonight
to be about us.

21:54.170 --> 21:55.726
So, what do I do?

21:55.750 --> 21:59.096
The smart thing would be to get
Nevin to launder the money.

21:59.120 --> 22:02.356
Use him as a CI to roll up
Marquel and his whole crew.

22:02.380 --> 22:04.226
Um, Nevin's trying
to go straight.

22:04.250 --> 22:06.056
We'd be destroying that.

22:06.080 --> 22:08.936
Yes, in order to put some
pretty bad people behind bars.

22:08.960 --> 22:12.596
Look, it's a tough call,
but...

22:12.620 --> 22:14.980
you're gonna have to get used to
making those as a sergeant.

22:16.420 --> 22:18.686
The scores are in?
The list just arrived.

22:18.710 --> 22:20.266
You're number 8
out of 140.

22:20.290 --> 22:22.186
Yes! I knew it.

22:25.040 --> 22:27.646
Congratulations...
Sergeant Bradford.

22:27.670 --> 22:29.646
Not a sergeant yet.

22:29.670 --> 22:31.556
At eight on the list,
it'll probably take six months or so.

22:31.580 --> 22:34.516
Actually, there's a position
opening in North Hollywood.

22:34.540 --> 22:36.396
The captain there
owes me a big favor.

22:36.420 --> 22:38.186
If you want,
I can make it happen.

22:38.210 --> 22:39.646
You'd start in two weeks.

22:39.670 --> 22:41.356
T-Two weeks?

22:41.380 --> 22:43.806
Uh... Uh, can I think
about this overnight?

22:43.830 --> 22:45.436
Yeah, of course.

22:45.460 --> 22:47.146
But there's no guarantee

22:47.170 --> 22:49.250
you'll get a better opportunity,
if you pass this up.

22:50.580 --> 22:53.096
Uh, more wine?

22:53.120 --> 22:55.306
No, I am... good.

22:55.330 --> 22:57.856
And the food was to
your satisfaction?

22:57.880 --> 23:00.096
It was great.
Excellent.

23:04.620 --> 23:06.356
This is weird, isn't it?

23:06.380 --> 23:08.016
No.

23:08.040 --> 23:09.186
Yes.
Yes.

23:09.210 --> 23:11.096
Yes, it's weird.

23:11.120 --> 23:12.436
You know what?
I-I got some advice today

23:12.460 --> 23:15.856
from a... sort of
a relationship expert,

23:15.880 --> 23:17.896
and I think
we should try it.

23:17.920 --> 23:19.516
Okay?
Okay.

23:19.540 --> 23:21.516
I'm gonna tell you
exactly what I'm thinking.

23:21.540 --> 23:22.806
No.
Yeah.

23:22.830 --> 23:24.436
Is that even possible?
I'm...

23:24.460 --> 23:26.016
W-Well, here it goes.
I'm gonna give it a try.

23:26.040 --> 23:28.096
Okay.

23:28.120 --> 23:31.226
When we were together...

23:31.250 --> 23:34.146
it was so... easy.

23:34.170 --> 23:36.646
It was so good.

23:36.670 --> 23:38.686
And now, here we are,
20 years later,

23:38.710 --> 23:41.226
and I'm... worried

23:41.250 --> 23:43.856
that maybe I'm trying to
recapture something

23:43.880 --> 23:46.476
that could potentially
already be gone forever.

23:46.500 --> 23:47.686
Does that sound crazy?

23:47.710 --> 23:50.476
No. I mean,
I-I... feel the same way.

23:50.500 --> 23:51.726
Okay.

23:51.750 --> 23:54.856
Because I really
like you, Grace.

23:54.880 --> 23:56.266
I like having you
as my friend.

23:56.290 --> 23:59.266
I really like
having you in my life,

23:59.290 --> 24:01.146
and I am terrified of
screwing that up again.

24:02.920 --> 24:07.476
Is this... a mistake,
trying to open this door?

24:07.500 --> 24:09.396
I don't know.

24:09.420 --> 24:11.476
I mean, maybe.

24:11.500 --> 24:13.556
But, um...

24:13.580 --> 24:15.146
But what?

24:17.670 --> 24:21.186
I really... want you
to kiss me right now.

24:28.880 --> 24:30.856
What was that?

24:38.330 --> 24:41.016
Someone just stole
my inheritance.

24:41.040 --> 24:42.686
Shouldn't you call it in
or something?

24:42.710 --> 24:44.726
No.

24:44.750 --> 24:46.040
Pretty sure I know
who did it.

24:53.170 --> 24:54.516
Yeah, I've been
here all night.

24:54.540 --> 24:57.096
What a completely natural way
to answer a door.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.356
Oh. Hey, John.

24:58.380 --> 24:59.556
Hi, Chastity.

24:59.580 --> 25:01.436
You know her?
Yeah. Long story.

25:01.460 --> 25:03.146
Chastity, have you been
with Pete all night?

25:03.170 --> 25:04.556
Yes. Did you at
any point in time

25:04.580 --> 25:06.056
witness him stealing a car? Oh,
yeah.

25:06.080 --> 25:07.356
I for sure saw him do that. Mm.

25:07.380 --> 25:08.766
I don't lie to a cop
for a guy

25:08.790 --> 25:10.120
until at least
the third date.

25:12.750 --> 25:14.936
Why don't you and I
go for a walk?

25:14.960 --> 25:17.096
O... kay. Yeah.

25:17.120 --> 25:18.580
Thank you.

25:20.790 --> 25:21.976
So, you gonna
arrest me now?

25:22.000 --> 25:23.976
No.
We have to talk.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.186
What? There's nothing
to talk about.

25:25.210 --> 25:26.556
Our dad is dead,

25:26.580 --> 25:28.056
and I don't know what
to do with that,

25:28.080 --> 25:29.596
and I got a feeling
you don't either,

25:29.620 --> 25:31.146
but maybe together,

25:31.170 --> 25:33.016
we could
figure something out.

25:33.040 --> 25:34.856
Alright, maybe that could help,
you know? Yes.

25:34.880 --> 25:36.516
My head is spinning
around right now. Exactly.

25:36.540 --> 25:38.726
And if you're anything like me,
you've got to be wondering,

25:38.750 --> 25:41.436
why would he leave
this car to me?

25:41.460 --> 25:43.596
Yeah, I mean, you know...

25:43.620 --> 25:46.186
we did work on it every day
after school, you know?

25:46.210 --> 25:48.806
He would save up money
and try and get all the parts,

25:48.830 --> 25:50.556
slowly build it up.

25:50.580 --> 25:52.016
I mean, it took four years
to build the whole car

25:52.040 --> 25:54.146
and then two to get it
to look like this.

25:54.170 --> 25:56.226
At least you had those moments
with him, you know?

25:56.250 --> 25:58.016
It's more than I got.

25:58.040 --> 26:00.146
Yeah.

26:00.170 --> 26:03.436
I'm sorry about that.
I, um...

26:03.460 --> 26:06.056
I think maybe he was
a little over-the-top

26:06.080 --> 26:07.646
and overcompensated with me

26:07.670 --> 26:10.306
because of how
he bolted out on you.

26:10.330 --> 26:11.896
It wasn't all good,
though, you know?

26:11.920 --> 26:14.476
Like, he came to my games,
but, like, he drank a lot,

26:14.500 --> 26:15.936
and by the seventh inning,
he was, like, trashed

26:15.960 --> 26:17.936
and embarrassed me
in front of my friends.

26:17.960 --> 26:20.266
You know?
Doesn't sound very fun.

26:20.290 --> 26:23.306
He gave me my first beer
when I was 13

26:23.330 --> 26:25.396
and then my first joint
when I was 15.

26:25.420 --> 26:27.000
So, I turned out great.

26:29.290 --> 26:31.766
I grew up thinking
I did something wrong.

26:31.790 --> 26:35.016
You know, if he loved me,
he wouldn't have left, right?

26:35.040 --> 26:38.436
I'd stay up late at night,
listening to my mom

26:38.460 --> 26:40.516
cry herself to sleep,
coming up with crazy plans

26:40.540 --> 26:41.686
how I was gonna
track him down

26:41.710 --> 26:43.686
and I guess win him back?

26:43.710 --> 26:46.856
But now I'm thinking...
I dodged a bullet.

26:46.880 --> 26:49.146
You dodged a huge bullet.

26:49.170 --> 26:50.936
Yeah.

26:50.960 --> 26:53.096
Still love him, though.

26:53.120 --> 26:54.476
Is that weird?

26:54.500 --> 26:56.330
No, that's not weird.
It's human.

26:59.250 --> 27:01.306
You know what?
You should have the car.

27:01.330 --> 27:02.976
What? Yeah, man,
it's what he wants.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.096
We should honor it, right?
Are you sure about this?

27:05.120 --> 27:06.226
Plus, I know I'm nuts
and everything,

27:06.250 --> 27:07.476
but I'll figure it out.

27:07.500 --> 27:08.896
You know, maybe me
giving you this

27:08.920 --> 27:11.750
is, uh... my closure,
or whatever they call it.

27:14.290 --> 27:15.976
I don't know if it's
what Dad intended,

27:16.000 --> 27:17.186
but by leaving me the car,

27:17.210 --> 27:18.976
he actually connected me
to you,

27:19.000 --> 27:20.896
so...
Oh.

27:23.210 --> 27:25.186
Stay in touch, Pete.
Yeah.

27:25.210 --> 27:27.016
Just come... come visit.

27:27.040 --> 27:28.726
You can make sure
she's running right.

27:28.750 --> 27:29.880
Deal.

27:31.040 --> 27:32.356
Oh.

27:32.380 --> 27:34.016
I have something for you.

27:34.040 --> 27:36.596
Come on. I...

27:36.620 --> 27:38.040
Come on.

27:47.920 --> 27:49.686
That's not...

27:49.710 --> 27:51.726
I figured,
you know, maybe...

27:51.750 --> 27:53.436
Pop the lid.
I figured, maybe, you know...

27:53.460 --> 27:54.686
Oh, you really don't have to... Hey,
man.

27:54.710 --> 27:56.556
It's our dad.
You deserve to have half, right?

27:56.580 --> 27:58.806
Uh...

27:58.830 --> 28:01.266
Look at that.
He's a chunky guy.

28:01.290 --> 28:02.436
Yeah.
Get a lot of that.

28:02.460 --> 28:04.476
Alright.

28:04.500 --> 28:06.436
Got some more beer.
Oh, that's right.

28:06.460 --> 28:09.306
Hey, do you, uh... do you wanna
come in for a-a nightcap?

28:09.330 --> 28:11.226
I'm gonna braid her hair
and watch a-a fight.

28:11.250 --> 28:13.306
Very sweet.
We really do have to go.

28:13.330 --> 28:15.056
I have to be at the
hospital early. So early.

28:15.080 --> 28:16.476
- Oh.
- Cool, cool.

28:16.500 --> 28:17.766
Okay, well, it was
very nice meeting you.

28:17.790 --> 28:19.226
And, uh...

28:20.830 --> 28:21.896
Cheers.
Do we... Do we hug?

28:21.920 --> 28:23.356
Yeah. Hell yeah.
Alright.

28:23.380 --> 28:24.976
Thanks for not
arresting me.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.516
Yeah.
Stay out of trouble.

28:26.540 --> 28:27.880
I will.

28:31.380 --> 28:33.806
Aw.
I like him.

28:33.830 --> 28:36.226
Really?
Yeah.

28:36.250 --> 28:38.436
I just can't believe
I have a brother.

28:38.460 --> 28:40.186
Half!

28:40.210 --> 28:42.096
We're half-brothers.

28:42.120 --> 28:43.306
Sorry,
the walls are thin.

28:43.330 --> 28:45.686
Brother.

28:47.380 --> 28:50.516
So, um... I guess...

28:50.540 --> 28:52.646
We're driving
ourselves home.

28:52.670 --> 28:54.056
Yeah.
Yeah.

28:54.080 --> 28:56.056
Not exactly how I
pictured the evening.

28:58.080 --> 29:00.016
I'm sorry for
spoiling our date.

29:00.040 --> 29:02.436
You kidding me?

29:02.460 --> 29:05.356
I mean, this goes down in
the unforgettable column.

29:05.380 --> 29:10.016
Well, um... lest we forget,
before all this happened...

29:10.040 --> 29:11.596
Mm-hmm... I think
we were interrupted.

29:11.620 --> 29:12.780
I think we were right
about...

29:14.170 --> 29:15.596
Mm.
Here.

29:25.580 --> 29:27.620
What's in the bucket?
Half my dad.

29:28.790 --> 29:31.096
Oh.

29:31.120 --> 29:34.000
Like I said...
unforgettable.

30:29.961 --> 30:32.396
Hey, Marquel.
Can we talk for a minute?

30:32.420 --> 30:34.266
Unless you gotta get
permission first.

30:34.290 --> 30:35.646
Nah, man. I'm good.

30:38.380 --> 30:40.476
You here to threaten me,
Officer Bradford?

30:40.500 --> 30:42.146
"Stay away from Nevin or else"?

30:42.170 --> 30:44.056
No. We both know
you don't scare.

30:44.080 --> 30:45.726
So what? You here to play
to my better angel?

30:45.750 --> 30:47.016
Yeah,
something like that.

30:47.040 --> 30:48.356
See, here I thought
you were a hard case,

30:48.380 --> 30:50.726
the man who put Keon
in Pelican Bay.

30:50.750 --> 30:52.976
Nevin did his time.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.686
He gave your crew
a decade of his life.

30:54.710 --> 30:55.896
Took the fall like
a good soldier.

30:55.920 --> 30:57.516
Let him walk away.

30:57.540 --> 31:00.556
And what's that do for my rep?
Lettin' people slide?

31:00.580 --> 31:03.396
"Reputation is an idle
and most false imposition,"

31:03.420 --> 31:06.056
oft got without merit
and lost without deserving.

31:06.080 --> 31:08.016
You have lost
no reputation at all

31:08.040 --> 31:10.686
"unless you repute yourself
such a loser."

31:10.710 --> 31:12.330
"Othello."

31:13.880 --> 31:16.186
That was a nice pull,

31:16.210 --> 31:17.436
but Shakespeare
didn't know nothing

31:17.460 --> 31:19.646
about running a gang
in the 21st century.

31:19.670 --> 31:21.596
You don't want to go
down this road.

31:21.620 --> 31:23.146
Trust me.

31:23.170 --> 31:25.436
Ain't no off-ramp here,
Bradford.

31:25.460 --> 31:28.766
See, I got plans for Nevin.

31:28.790 --> 31:30.310
There's nothing you
can do to stop 'em.

31:33.250 --> 31:35.146
What do we do now?
I don't know.

31:35.170 --> 31:36.726
We made our play,
and we failed.

31:36.750 --> 31:38.266
Wow.

31:38.290 --> 31:40.686
I never thought I'd see you
give up that easily.

31:40.710 --> 31:43.186
You got a path to victory, Boot,
I'm all ears.

31:43.210 --> 31:45.096
No, I don't,
but you're the king

31:45.120 --> 31:46.686
of subversive tests
and tricks.

31:46.710 --> 31:48.016
There's got to be
some way to win

31:48.040 --> 31:50.040
by coming at this
sideways.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.806
Harper, Nolan.

31:56.830 --> 31:59.056
Rampart picked up
that scratch-off guy

31:59.080 --> 32:01.186
from the strip club video.
Tucker Novak?

32:01.210 --> 32:02.936
Is that the guy
you put a BOLO out on?

32:02.960 --> 32:04.556
Yes, sir.
Then, yes.

32:04.580 --> 32:06.476
He's in Cell 3.

32:06.500 --> 32:08.056
I'm innocent.
Of what?

32:08.080 --> 32:09.596
Of whatever y'all
about to accuse me of.

32:09.620 --> 32:12.516
You went to the Red Angel
strip club two nights ago.

32:12.540 --> 32:13.540
Nope.

32:15.040 --> 32:16.686
Can I have that?
No.

32:16.710 --> 32:18.806
You stole those tickets
from the liquor store on Pico,

32:18.830 --> 32:20.146
and then you killed
the owner.

32:20.170 --> 32:21.936
Whoa! I had nothing
to do with that.

32:21.960 --> 32:23.516
And I sure as hell
didn't kill anybody.

32:23.540 --> 32:25.936
Then who did?

32:25.960 --> 32:27.936
I want diplomatic immunity.

32:27.960 --> 32:30.096
Yeah, see, my father...
He was born in Spain,

32:30.120 --> 32:33.266
and they're members of NATO...
I think.

32:33.290 --> 32:35.290
So... Yeah.
I want diplomatic immunity.

32:37.210 --> 32:39.436
Okay.
You got it.

32:39.460 --> 32:41.056
Wait. Really?
Mm-hmm.

32:41.080 --> 32:42.646
Spanish father
means you are solid.

32:42.670 --> 32:44.436
Awesome.
Alright, check this out.

32:44.460 --> 32:46.646
My boy Colt gave me
a call the other day,

32:46.670 --> 32:49.686
said he needed help scratching
off 500 lottery tickets.

32:49.710 --> 32:51.726
But, hey, he didn't mention
no murdered woman.

32:51.750 --> 32:53.516
And he just let you
keep the winners?

32:53.540 --> 32:56.146
I mean, only the small ones,
like I gave that stripper.

32:56.170 --> 32:59.476
No, he kept the big one.
The big Kahuna, worth 250 grand.

32:59.500 --> 33:01.186
And where can we
find Colt? I don't know.

33:01.210 --> 33:02.556
He told his roommates
he was moving out

33:02.580 --> 33:04.016
once he scratched off
the big winner,

33:04.040 --> 33:05.646
and last I heard of him,

33:05.670 --> 33:07.226
he was still trying
to cash in the ticket.

33:07.250 --> 33:09.686
Lottery doesn't pay out prizes
that size at convenience stores.

33:09.710 --> 33:11.896
Either you have to mail it in
or go up to Sacramento.

33:11.920 --> 33:14.266
I'll call Sacramento PD, have
them sit on the lottery office.

33:14.290 --> 33:15.726
Uh, what about me?

33:15.750 --> 33:17.766
Uh, you're under arrest for
accessory after the fact.

33:17.790 --> 33:19.436
But what about my immunity?

33:19.460 --> 33:21.120
So, bad news.

33:23.580 --> 33:25.266
Wesley.

33:25.290 --> 33:26.806
You'll never believe...

33:26.830 --> 33:29.266
I met the most fascinating
people in here last night.

33:29.290 --> 33:30.766
Uh-huh.

33:30.790 --> 33:32.096
Lawrence, give us a minute.

33:32.120 --> 33:34.016
Well, we're discussing
my legal strategy, dear.

33:34.040 --> 33:35.306
He does DUIs for rich kids,

33:35.330 --> 33:36.766
which is why you spent
the night in jail.

33:36.790 --> 33:39.620
This is a criminal matter.
You need a criminal lawyer.

33:41.170 --> 33:43.000
Okay, thanks, Lawrence.

33:48.210 --> 33:51.226
I know why you want
to protect Christian,

33:51.250 --> 33:53.726
but you do not understand
who he really is.

33:53.750 --> 33:56.356
I ran a background search.

33:56.380 --> 33:58.976
He's been to prison
for armed robbery,

33:59.000 --> 34:00.186
and the gun he gave you...

34:00.210 --> 34:01.726
He used it in a crime
after he got out.

34:01.750 --> 34:03.306
He shot someone.

34:03.330 --> 34:04.766
They almost died.

34:04.790 --> 34:06.856
God, I had no idea.

34:06.880 --> 34:08.856
He took advantage of you,

34:08.880 --> 34:11.096
but you will be charged
in his crime

34:11.120 --> 34:13.766
unless you tell Angela
that he gave you the gun

34:13.790 --> 34:16.306
so that she can
go arrest him.

34:20.670 --> 34:23.186
Christian Roberts,
we need to talk to you.

34:23.210 --> 34:25.266
Damn. I was really hoping
he wouldn't run.

34:25.290 --> 34:26.806
Told you not to eat
that meatball sub.

34:51.380 --> 34:53.726
Where'd he go?

34:53.750 --> 34:55.766
I don't know.

34:55.790 --> 34:57.146
Why are you wet?

34:57.170 --> 34:59.096
I don't want
to talk about it.

34:59.120 --> 35:01.686
7-Adam-07, send additional
units to our location.

35:01.710 --> 35:03.510
Foot pursuit... lost visual. Wait! Wait,
wait!

35:06.920 --> 35:09.056
Get on your stomach. Dispatch,
cancel request.

35:09.080 --> 35:11.080
Suspect in custody, Code 4.
Hands behind your back.

35:13.460 --> 35:14.896
Nolan.

35:14.920 --> 35:17.356
Colt Henry just tried to cash in
a stolen scratch-off

35:17.380 --> 35:19.306
at a store
across from Union Station.

35:19.330 --> 35:21.356
He must be trying to grab
a train to Sacramento.

35:21.380 --> 35:23.120
Feel like some overtime?
Hell yeah.

35:25.380 --> 35:27.396
Check the board.
Where is it? There.

35:27.420 --> 35:29.186
Train to Sacramento,
platform three.

35:29.210 --> 35:31.016
Okay, that is in
20 minutes.

35:31.040 --> 35:33.556
Let's split up.
Hey, hey, listen.

35:33.580 --> 35:35.476
So far, this case has been
strippers and idiots,

35:35.500 --> 35:38.306
but this guy... he killed
a woman in cold blood.

35:38.330 --> 35:39.920
Don't lose sight of that.
I won't.

35:42.540 --> 35:44.856
Man on P.A.: Attention, please.

35:44.880 --> 35:48.646
This is the last call for
Amtrak Pacific Surfliner

35:48.670 --> 35:52.896
train number 579,
en route to San Diego.

35:55.960 --> 35:57.896
I went to
the far end of the concourse.

35:57.920 --> 36:00.856
No sign of Colt.

36:00.880 --> 36:04.596
Passengers for Amtrak
Pacific Surfliner number 579,

36:04.620 --> 36:06.726
please proceed to track one.

36:06.750 --> 36:10.306
Police.
Turn around very slowly.

36:23.750 --> 36:26.056
- Move, move, move.
- He's got a gun!

36:29.080 --> 36:30.476
He's got a gun!

36:30.500 --> 36:31.856
Move.

36:41.580 --> 36:42.936
Where is he?

36:42.960 --> 36:43.937
I don't know. Did
you see him? No.

36:45.710 --> 36:47.476
Someone help me!

36:47.500 --> 36:48.500
Go. Go.

36:56.170 --> 36:57.170
Back up.

37:02.880 --> 37:04.396
Don't do this.

37:07.120 --> 37:09.146
Get back, lady.
Not gonna happen.

37:09.170 --> 37:11.356
Show me your hands,
and they better be empty.

37:11.380 --> 37:12.766
I didn't mean to
kill that woman.

37:12.790 --> 37:14.516
She grabbed for my gun.

37:14.540 --> 37:16.056
Why'd she do that?

37:16.080 --> 37:17.436
There was only a few hundred
in the register.

37:17.460 --> 37:19.556
There's nothing we can do
about that now,

37:19.580 --> 37:22.226
but you can control
what happens next.

37:22.250 --> 37:25.186
My whole life,
I never won anything.

37:25.210 --> 37:27.936
But I got that big ticket now,
and I want to cash it in.

37:27.960 --> 37:29.596
It's worthless, Colt.

37:29.620 --> 37:31.056
Just like the one you tried
to cash in across the street.

37:31.080 --> 37:32.396
They were all cancelled

37:32.420 --> 37:35.016
the moment they were
reported stolen.

37:35.040 --> 37:38.146
This is... It's not fair.

37:38.170 --> 37:39.726
I never won anything
in my life.

37:42.080 --> 37:43.686
But I won that.

37:43.710 --> 37:45.516
You... You can't take
that away from me.

37:45.540 --> 37:47.306
The only thing you
are winning is a body bag

37:47.330 --> 37:48.806
if you don't give up
right now.

37:48.830 --> 37:50.686
You think I care?

37:50.710 --> 37:52.976
I'm looking at life
in prison.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.726
So... I'm calling
the shots here.

37:56.750 --> 37:59.896
So, turn around
and walk away.

37:59.920 --> 38:01.896
Right now.

38:01.920 --> 38:03.670
Or else...
Or else what?!

38:04.880 --> 38:08.186
Your last act in life is
gonna be murdering a child?

38:08.210 --> 38:10.476
The world doesn't
owe you anything, Colt.

38:10.500 --> 38:12.516
Not a winning lottery ticket,
not a happy childhood.

38:12.540 --> 38:13.976
Nothing.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.596
We all got to do the best
with what we got,

38:15.620 --> 38:17.686
and for you, right now,

38:17.710 --> 38:20.146
that means giving up
and getting on the ground.

38:33.830 --> 38:37.436
O-Okay.

38:37.460 --> 38:39.620
I'm pulling my hand out.

38:41.040 --> 38:43.396
I let go of the gun.

38:43.420 --> 38:46.646
It's...
D-Don't shoot me.

38:46.670 --> 38:50.806
Okay, okay.

38:50.830 --> 38:52.556
Okay, okay.

38:52.580 --> 38:54.806
Okay. Oh.

39:01.250 --> 39:03.936
Suspect in custody.
Code 4.

39:11.880 --> 39:14.016
Thank you.

39:18.290 --> 39:21.686
I handled your father's
leaving very badly,

39:21.710 --> 39:22.936
and his death,

39:22.960 --> 39:24.226
and I've spent
the past few years

39:24.250 --> 39:25.766
just feeling sorry
for myself.

39:25.790 --> 39:27.596
I'm...

39:27.620 --> 39:30.120
Look, it's my fault, too,
for not being around more.

39:31.920 --> 39:34.056
I've been a little
selfish. A little?

39:35.460 --> 39:36.936
Sorry.

39:36.960 --> 39:40.646
Look, I promise to try
harder to... get over myself,

39:40.670 --> 39:42.766
be there for you.

39:42.790 --> 39:44.356
And the good news is

39:44.380 --> 39:46.096
the DA's not pressing charges
against you,

39:46.120 --> 39:48.516
so we can all
use this as, um...

39:48.540 --> 39:51.146
a learning experience.

39:58.170 --> 39:59.806
Genius move,
making Nevin's

39:59.830 --> 40:02.516
the go-to donut shop
for the LAPD.

40:02.540 --> 40:04.710
Yeah, Marquel wouldn't dare
launder money here now.

40:06.500 --> 40:09.686
North Hollywood's lucky to have
a sergeant like you coming in.

40:09.710 --> 40:12.056
Actually, I, uh...

40:12.080 --> 40:13.186
I told Grey that
I'm not interested

40:13.210 --> 40:15.726
in moving up just yet.

40:15.750 --> 40:18.266
What, are you holding out
for Malibu?

40:18.290 --> 40:21.556
Tim Bradford finishes
what he starts.

40:21.580 --> 40:22.980
I haven't finished
training you yet.

40:25.250 --> 40:27.290
No. You haven't.

40:29.540 --> 40:31.516
You are gonna move up at
some point, though, right?

40:31.540 --> 40:33.766
Because I put a lot of time
into those books on tape.

40:36.250 --> 40:37.556
Yeah.

40:41.380 --> 40:47.056
"I had a great time
last night!"

40:52.210 --> 40:54.016
"Great time last night.

40:54.040 --> 40:58.056
Let's do it again... soon."

40:58.080 --> 41:00.226
"Let's do it again soon?"

41:00.250 --> 41:03.146
"Let's do it again soon."

41:03.170 --> 41:05.146
Why don't people
just call anymore?

41:07.500 --> 41:10.556
Hey. I was... I-I was just
trying to text you.

41:10.580 --> 41:12.016
Trying?

41:12.040 --> 41:14.056
Well, uh,
there's an art to it.

41:14.080 --> 41:15.516
I'm just messing with you.

41:15.540 --> 41:17.936
I just spent the last half-hour
rewriting a text to you,

41:17.960 --> 41:19.396
and then I just...
You know, I, um...

41:19.420 --> 41:21.476
I figured that
I'd just call.

41:21.500 --> 41:24.396
Well, I'm glad you did.

41:24.420 --> 41:25.516
What was that?

41:25.540 --> 41:27.056
Uh, that was the sound

41:27.080 --> 41:29.266
of my inheritance
being stolen again.

41:29.290 --> 41:31.806
Can I call you right back? Sure.

41:31.830 --> 41:33.226
Tell Pete I said hi.

41:33.250 --> 41:34.806
Will do.

41:37.620 --> 41:39.096
Yo.

41:39.120 --> 41:41.186
I thought you said
you needed me to have the car

41:41.210 --> 41:42.936
so you could have closure.

41:42.960 --> 41:45.556
Yeah, no, I-I don't really
believe in closure.

41:45.580 --> 41:48.186
Plus, Chastity
loves the car.

41:48.210 --> 41:50.306
Hi, John.
Hi, Chastity.

41:50.330 --> 41:55.556
So, Pete, listen I-I know you
don't believe in closure,

41:55.580 --> 41:59.186
but I do, and you've
given me some...

41:59.210 --> 42:01.016
Closure I never thought
I would have.

42:01.040 --> 42:03.016
So thank you.

42:03.040 --> 42:04.556
Anytime, man.

42:04.580 --> 42:06.056
Hey, you think you
could do me a favor

42:06.080 --> 42:07.646
and maybe mail me
the keys?

42:07.670 --> 42:09.306
'Cause I had to hot-wire
this in your driveway.

42:09.330 --> 42:10.307
Sure thing.

42:10.331 --> 42:12.896
Stay safe, Pete.
Keep in touch.

42:12.920 --> 42:14.556
You got it.

42:14.580 --> 42:16.056
Hey, man, having
a brother cop is pretty sick.

42:16.080 --> 42:18.096
That means a-a lot to me, Pete.

42:18.120 --> 42:19.896
Even from you.
