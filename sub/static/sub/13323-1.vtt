WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:02.803
- Next is a Bravo
scripted original series.

00:04.272 --> 00:06.440
- Last season
on "Odd Mom Out"...

00:06.474 --> 00:08.376
- This from Dottie.

00:08.409 --> 00:11.479
"My mommy loves tattoos,

00:11.512 --> 00:14.148
"underwear dance parties,

00:14.182 --> 00:16.484
and bad words."

00:17.885 --> 00:20.020
- Oh, shit.

00:20.054 --> 00:22.956
[rock music]

00:22.990 --> 00:24.858
It's my sister-in-law.
I can't escape her.

00:24.892 --> 00:26.827
- Just promise me
you will not turn

00:26.860 --> 00:28.729
into one of those
freaky mom-bots.

00:28.762 --> 00:30.898
[water splatters]
- Oh, shit.

00:30.931 --> 00:32.066
[groaning]
- One more push.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.701
- I can't do it!
- Yes, you can!

00:33.734 --> 00:35.169
You are an Olympian!

00:35.203 --> 00:36.804
[baby cries]
- Jill...

00:36.837 --> 00:40.074
from now on,
we have to stick together.

00:40.108 --> 00:43.043
- You are wasting your life
at that white-shoe law firm.

00:43.077 --> 00:44.378
You should come work
for Hercules.

00:44.412 --> 00:45.679
- Lex--
- What the--

00:45.713 --> 00:47.248
- Oh!
- Lex is cheating on Brooke

00:47.281 --> 00:48.282
with his assistant Ella.

00:48.316 --> 00:49.417
- [gasps]

00:49.450 --> 00:50.584
- Did you say something?

00:50.618 --> 00:52.720
- Next time,
keep it in your pants.

00:52.753 --> 00:54.922
I quit.
all: [gasp]

00:54.955 --> 00:56.924
- I'm sorry your
husband cheated on you,

00:56.957 --> 00:58.426
but you manipulated me

00:58.459 --> 01:00.928
the way you manipulate
everyone to get your way.

01:00.961 --> 01:02.163
- [grunts]
- [yelps]

01:02.196 --> 01:03.164
all: [gasp]

01:03.197 --> 01:04.198
- [exhales sharply]

01:05.933 --> 01:08.636
- It is so funny
to bump into you here.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.304
- I know.
I can't believe it.

01:10.338 --> 01:13.574
- So how was your summer?
- Not good.

01:13.607 --> 01:16.043
We did a gut job on the house
on Gin Lane,

01:16.144 --> 01:17.611
but it wasn't ready
in time.

01:17.645 --> 01:20.281
So we had to stay in
a $50,000 rental next door,

01:20.314 --> 01:22.750
but now my contractor isn't
speaking to my architect

01:22.783 --> 01:24.318
who isn't speaking
to my decorator.

01:24.352 --> 01:26.487
It's like civil war.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.522
- Ooh, I think I found one.

01:31.892 --> 01:34.995
Holy Neptune's nutsack!

01:35.028 --> 01:37.030
Oh, my God,
steamrollered boobage.

01:37.064 --> 01:38.499
I can't look at it!

01:38.532 --> 01:41.469
Oh, my God, has anyone's nipple
ever exploded?

01:41.502 --> 01:43.671
No, wait, don't tell me.
No, tell me.

01:43.704 --> 01:44.705
No, don't.
Don't.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.006
Are my cans gonna be

01:46.039 --> 01:47.375
smashed beaver tails after this,

01:47.408 --> 01:48.809
or do they go back to melons?

01:48.842 --> 01:50.178
- Ma'am it's very important
that

01:50.178 --> 01:53.447
you don't move
or talk or breathe.

01:53.481 --> 01:55.283
- Sorry, bad habit.

01:56.984 --> 01:58.619
[machine whirs]
Oh, mercy.

01:58.652 --> 02:01.455
Mercy mine.

02:01.489 --> 02:04.358
If guys had to shove
their nutsack on this thing

02:04.392 --> 02:06.527
and turn 'em
into silver dollar pancakes,

02:06.560 --> 02:08.629
they'd find a better way,
am I right?

02:08.662 --> 02:11.699
- Mm-hmm.
Time for the other side now.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.901
- What?
Is that really necessary?

02:13.934 --> 02:15.603
I have to do the other one?

02:15.636 --> 02:17.037
[quietly]
Oh, my God.

02:17.070 --> 02:18.105
*

02:18.206 --> 02:20.808
- * Hey, yes, you know

02:20.841 --> 02:23.777
* I'm feeling fine,
I'm feeling fine *

02:24.845 --> 02:26.547
- Oh, look, it's my boobs.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.216
- To healthy cans.
- [chuckles]

02:28.216 --> 02:31.652
And with my family history,
that's no small feat.

02:31.685 --> 02:34.588
[tense music]

02:34.622 --> 02:35.956
Oh, my God, sorry,

02:35.989 --> 02:37.991
I keep thinking
I'm seeing Brooke.

02:38.025 --> 02:40.228
I have loved
this break from her.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.595
Why does it have to end?

02:41.629 --> 02:43.264
- School starts tomorrow, right?

02:43.297 --> 02:45.966
Relax, the woman doused you
in fruit punch.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.535
I mean, what else can she do?

02:47.568 --> 02:49.470
- She could throw
one of her handbags at me.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.138
- Oh, my God,
is she still making those?

02:51.239 --> 02:52.973
Come on.
- She keeps posting pictures

02:53.006 --> 02:55.243
of her trunk shows
in the Cramptons.

02:55.243 --> 02:57.945
Her friends are actually paying
for her original designs.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.480
- Ah, too good.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.682
Here's what you're gonna do next
time you see her.

03:01.715 --> 03:02.950
- I already told you.

03:02.983 --> 03:04.385
I can't call her
the gold medalist

03:04.418 --> 03:05.819
in the Asshole Olympics.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.821
Andy's making me
take the high road.

03:07.855 --> 03:10.324
- Fine, but I went to
this empowerment workshop

03:10.358 --> 03:12.326
the other day
for female physicians--

03:12.360 --> 03:15.128
- Aka doctors without penises.
- Exactly.

03:15.162 --> 03:18.098
And it's all about power-posing
to command respect.

03:18.131 --> 03:21.569
You've gotta take up
an obnoxious amount of space.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.404
Like this...

03:23.437 --> 03:25.038
- Okay, thanks, Linda Carter.

03:25.072 --> 03:27.040
- Or even better, this...

03:28.609 --> 03:30.378
Key is to communicate dominance.

03:30.411 --> 03:31.745
- Can you sit down?

03:31.779 --> 03:33.781
Your dominance is starting
to freak me out.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.683
- Oh, and you can do it
at the magazine.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.418
Aren't you meeting
with your old assistant today?

03:37.451 --> 03:39.887
- Yes, but she's
senior photo editor now.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.922
It's gonna be so weird
to be back there.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.924
So many skeletons.
- Literally.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.293
You were, like,
the fat chick there.

03:45.293 --> 03:47.060
- [laughs]
And, of course,

03:47.094 --> 03:49.397
Trixie's still in charge,
sucking up people's souls

03:49.430 --> 03:51.131
like a DustBuster,

03:51.164 --> 03:53.567
but I guess I have to "network"

03:53.601 --> 03:55.703
if I want to
jump start my career.

03:55.736 --> 03:58.539
- Well, it's "about time."

03:58.572 --> 03:59.973
[car horn honks]

04:03.644 --> 04:07.448
- * Let the river run *

04:07.481 --> 04:13.987
* Let all the dreamers
wake the nation *

04:14.021 --> 04:16.324
[horns honking]

04:16.324 --> 04:18.826
- Daddy, are you unemployed?

04:18.859 --> 04:22.330
- No, Miles, I am on what
is called a sabbatical,

04:22.363 --> 04:24.832
which means we get
to do a bunch of fun stuff,

04:24.865 --> 04:27.234
and then I start my new job
in January.

04:27.335 --> 04:31.705
But today, we are gonna go
to the zoo, the boat pond,

04:31.739 --> 04:34.642
then we're gonna water taxi
over to Red Hook.

04:34.675 --> 04:38.011
- But are we ever seeing
Uncle Lex again?

04:38.045 --> 04:40.848
- What?
Um, of course.

04:40.881 --> 04:43.884
Sure, yeah.
Actually, you know what?

04:43.917 --> 04:46.153
Uncle Lex's new place is
right by the subway.

04:46.186 --> 04:49.156
Why don't we stop there first
and cheer him up?

04:49.189 --> 04:50.824
- Oh, my God, the lamp.

04:50.858 --> 04:52.493
I can't believe
you still have that.

04:52.526 --> 04:55.529
- Oh, and I risked everything
smuggling it in here.

04:55.563 --> 04:57.831
There is an actual
tchotchke limit now,

04:57.865 --> 04:59.767
but you gave it to me

04:59.800 --> 05:01.569
and you're still
my favorite boss.

05:01.602 --> 05:04.372
- Oh, Kate, that means
so much to me.

05:04.372 --> 05:07.675
This stay-at-home mom thing
has gotten so old.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.477
- Yeah, but at least you got off
the hamster wheel

05:09.510 --> 05:11.144
long enough to get
a personal life.

05:11.178 --> 05:14.515
- Oh, I'm--I'm so grateful
for my kids, of course--

05:14.548 --> 05:17.385
- Oh, I meant your husband.
- Oh, him too.

05:17.385 --> 05:19.119
I'm not complaining.
I'm just--

05:19.152 --> 05:20.120
- Don't listen to me.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.589
I am just so fried

05:21.622 --> 05:22.623
after fashion week.

05:22.656 --> 05:23.691
There have been so many layoffs,

05:23.724 --> 05:25.158
morale is in the shitter.

05:25.192 --> 05:27.094
- I've been hearing.
- Don't worry.

05:27.127 --> 05:28.862
We are still hiring
photographers,

05:28.896 --> 05:30.297
and I'm about
to sit down with Trixie,

05:30.398 --> 05:32.766
so if you're serious,

05:32.800 --> 05:34.402
I'll get her to rubberstamp
a few gigs

05:34.402 --> 05:35.569
I think you'd be perfect for.

05:35.603 --> 05:36.970
- Really?
Like, now?

05:37.004 --> 05:38.506
- Totally.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.641
Take my ID, go to the caf,

05:40.674 --> 05:42.710
put anything you want on it,
and be greedy.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.912
When you get back,
we'll get down do brass tacks.

05:44.945 --> 05:47.648
- Thank you.
This is so exciting.

05:47.681 --> 05:48.982
I worship thee!
- Aww.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.951
- Building a shrine.
- Aww.

05:50.984 --> 05:57.891
*

05:57.925 --> 06:01.228
- The first von Weber line,
"Palm Bitch,"

06:01.261 --> 06:03.731
was about embracing entitlement.

06:03.764 --> 06:06.567
It took inspiration
from Slim Aarons photographs,

06:06.600 --> 06:09.470
toddlers in lederhosen,
and attitude.

06:09.503 --> 06:13.974
As you know, our South Hampton
trunk show sold out in one day.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.709
- Obviously,
you've touched on something.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.445
- Mm, I have.

06:17.478 --> 06:21.482
And my fall collection is
all centered on one thing,

06:21.515 --> 06:22.750
decadence.

06:22.783 --> 06:25.586
- Decadence is the new excess.
- It's trending.

06:25.619 --> 06:26.887
- J'neece is in charge

06:26.920 --> 06:28.789
of von Weber's urban markets.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.691
Like so many cutting-edge
corporations,

06:30.724 --> 06:33.293
we've made diversity
a top priority.

06:33.326 --> 06:36.664
J'neece is our
not-so-secret weapon.

06:36.697 --> 06:37.965
- Yes.

06:37.998 --> 06:39.733
It's Janice.

06:39.767 --> 06:42.069
- To me, decadence is

06:42.102 --> 06:44.872
coming home after
a black-tie affair,

06:44.905 --> 06:46.540
kicking off your stilettos,

06:46.574 --> 06:49.910
unzipping your velvet dress
by the fire,

06:49.943 --> 06:52.913
and reminding yourself
it was for charity.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.715
You earned it.

06:54.748 --> 06:55.716
- I like it.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.686
It's feminine, yet muscular.

06:58.719 --> 07:01.489
As you know, Trixie,
men have always

07:01.522 --> 07:02.923
been seeking pleasure

07:02.956 --> 07:04.958
at all costs.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.761
It's our turn.

07:07.795 --> 07:11.164
*

07:11.198 --> 07:12.165
- I'm giddy!

07:12.199 --> 07:13.400
It went so well,

07:13.501 --> 07:15.503
I didn't even need
the power-poses,

07:15.536 --> 07:18.038
and Andy's having
a great day with the kids.

07:18.071 --> 07:19.507
- That's amazing.

07:19.507 --> 07:23.844
[tense music]

07:23.877 --> 07:26.279
- Ugh, freaking Brooke-a-likes
everywhere.

07:26.313 --> 07:27.848
- Brooke wouldn't be downtown.

07:27.881 --> 07:30.217
She gets nosebleeds
south of 57th Street.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.318
- You're so right.

07:31.351 --> 07:33.053
Vaness, no more shooting

07:33.086 --> 07:34.888
toddler birthday parties.

07:34.922 --> 07:37.891
* I'm going back
to the newsstands *

07:37.925 --> 07:39.126
- Yes, Weber!

07:39.159 --> 07:41.228
Yay!

07:41.261 --> 07:43.897
- Listen, Miles, if you pull
your pants down one more time

07:43.931 --> 07:44.898
we are going home.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.233
- Mini-Webs!

07:46.266 --> 07:47.735
- Uncle Lex!
- Hi!

07:47.768 --> 07:49.036
- Hey, what'd you guys do,

07:49.069 --> 07:50.971
take Miracle Grow
over the summer, huh?

07:51.004 --> 07:54.407
Hey, there's a deluxe Foosball
over there.

07:54.441 --> 07:56.844
- No, me first!
- Go check it out.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.712
[both shouting]

07:58.746 --> 08:00.548
So...
good to see you, man.

08:00.581 --> 08:03.951
- Yeah.
That's new.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.018
Mom seen that?

08:05.052 --> 08:06.620
- Yeah, she hates it.

08:06.654 --> 08:09.156
She'll never understand
what I've been through.

08:09.189 --> 08:10.958
From the moment I got
to Man Camp,

08:10.991 --> 08:12.693
things just started
to shift for me.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.127
- Right, sure.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.196
- By the time
I got to Burning Man,

08:16.229 --> 08:18.331
I was just open.

08:18.365 --> 08:20.568
- Yeah, no, you touched on that
in your email diaries, right.

08:20.568 --> 08:21.569
- So, are we good?

08:21.569 --> 08:22.970
Because I'm happy

08:23.003 --> 08:24.572
to hash things out
with you again.

08:24.572 --> 08:26.740
Unpack.
- No, no, not necessary.

08:26.774 --> 08:29.577
We're--it's all--I'm just glad
you're hanging in there.

08:29.577 --> 08:32.212
Found a nice place to live.
- Better than nice, dude.

08:32.245 --> 08:33.981
Bunch of my YPO buddies
are here.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.583
My old boss from Goldman,

08:35.583 --> 08:37.885
the guy who invented
Uber for hot tubs.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.352
- [chuckles]
- They're all between marriages.

08:39.386 --> 08:41.254
Hey, we should hit up
the golf simulator.

08:41.288 --> 08:44.424
Throw the kids in the rec room.
Fully staffed 24/7.

08:44.457 --> 08:45.826
- I wish;
This is my last full day

08:45.859 --> 08:46.860
with the kids.

08:46.894 --> 08:47.928
We got a lot planned.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.362
I'm just glad you're doing okay.

08:49.396 --> 08:50.430
I was worried.

08:50.463 --> 08:52.499
- No need.
I'm fine.

08:52.600 --> 08:56.269
- Miles keeps picking his nose
and wiping his boogies on us!

08:56.303 --> 08:59.006
- Okay.
See ya.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.207
- Daddy, come and look at me.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.341
- Get off of me
or I swear to God...

09:01.374 --> 09:03.076
- Have fun.

09:03.110 --> 09:04.778
- Hello.

09:04.812 --> 09:07.848
[rock music]

09:07.881 --> 09:10.250
- This is declined.
- Seriously?

09:10.283 --> 09:12.419
That's weird.
That's okay, I have cash.

09:12.452 --> 09:14.822
- We don't take cash.
- You don't take cash?

09:14.855 --> 09:16.523
Who doesn't take cash?

09:16.624 --> 09:19.927
Um, can I do an IOU?
Personal check?

09:19.960 --> 09:20.961
Bitcoin?

09:20.994 --> 09:23.797
- No, way!
Jill Kaplan.

09:23.831 --> 09:27.467
- Amy.
- No way.

09:28.535 --> 09:30.103
- It's for my kids.

09:30.137 --> 09:31.504
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
Elizabeth left.

09:31.538 --> 09:32.873
She went to Harper's Bazaar,

09:32.906 --> 09:35.542
and Trixie literally kicked her
in the cooter

09:35.643 --> 09:36.877
when she found out.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.812
And now there's
a whole lawsuit pending,

09:38.846 --> 09:40.113
so I can't say much.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.649
- How does Elizabeth
still have a job?

09:41.649 --> 09:42.816
- I don't know.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.785
- Well, look who's back
from the dead.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.353
- Richard!
How are you?

09:46.386 --> 09:48.021
- Oh, that dress is gor-gina.

09:48.055 --> 09:50.691
- Oh, my God, Man-orexia.
- Oh, what about Aims here?

09:50.724 --> 09:52.559
- Me?
Richard, you're my birth weight.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.795
- You make Amal Clooney look
like she needs gastric bypass.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.096
- You're Karen Carpenter.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.564
- Karen Carpenter climbed
out of her coffin,

09:57.665 --> 09:58.766
looked at you and was so jealous

09:58.799 --> 10:00.500
she popped a laxative
and crawled back in.

10:00.668 --> 10:02.970
- I'm obsessed with you.
Are you not obsessed?

10:03.003 --> 10:03.971
- Obsessed.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.205
That day that Trixie

10:05.238 --> 10:06.640
threw a stapler at my head,

10:06.674 --> 10:08.141
he still managed
to make me laugh.

10:08.175 --> 10:09.576
- But you got out.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.144
I'm in therapy
three times a week.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.213
- Well, actually,
I might be doing some work

10:13.246 --> 10:14.848
for the magazine again.

10:14.882 --> 10:17.084
Kate's hooking me up
with some freelance gigs.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.653
- Kate Cooper?

10:19.687 --> 10:21.689
When did you meet with her?
- Just now.

10:21.722 --> 10:23.523
She's the one
who lent me her meal card.

10:23.556 --> 10:25.659
Why?
- Oh, no reason.

10:25.693 --> 10:28.996
Okay, I've gotta yell at Fiona
for taking my J. Mendel samples.

10:29.029 --> 10:30.163
- And I totally have
to go with you.

10:30.197 --> 10:31.498
It was really good seeing you,
Jill.

10:31.531 --> 10:33.400
- Oh--oh, thanks for the snacks.

10:33.433 --> 10:34.601
- [mouthing]

10:34.634 --> 10:39.539
*

10:39.572 --> 10:41.775
- Are you sure it's okay, to
leave 'em in the kids' lounge?

10:41.809 --> 10:43.744
- Yeah, it's kid heaven.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.412
Everybody wins.

10:45.445 --> 10:47.114
What?
Were they being little shits?

10:47.147 --> 10:48.248
- [exhales]

10:48.281 --> 10:50.083
I just need about a half hour
to decompress.

10:50.117 --> 10:51.551
- That's not enough time.

10:51.584 --> 10:54.121
I just booked an 80 minute
Thai-yoga massage.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.556
You gotta join me.
- I better not.

10:56.589 --> 10:58.591
I--at the very least,
I gotta get 'em to the zoo.

10:58.625 --> 11:02.495
- Dude, you're shadowboxing
against a dead guy.

11:02.529 --> 11:05.733
Dad was never around
emotionally or physically,

11:05.733 --> 11:08.101
so now you're over-compensating.

11:08.135 --> 11:09.937
Okay?

11:09.970 --> 11:11.638
So let's go get a massage.

11:12.740 --> 11:13.841
- Oh, my God.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.642
Kate, what's going on?

11:15.743 --> 11:18.045
- I'm out.
I got shit-canned.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.280
- No way.
I am so sorry.

11:20.313 --> 11:22.615
It wasn't the lamp, was it?

11:22.649 --> 11:23.784
- [crying]
No.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.652
- Oh, God.
Well, I-I should just--

11:25.753 --> 11:28.155
- I gave this place my 20s,
and my 30s.

11:28.188 --> 11:31.058
I have no husband, no kids,
no sex life.

11:31.091 --> 11:33.560
I have GI problems
round the clock.

11:33.593 --> 11:36.964
Diarrhea or constipation,
nothing in between,

11:36.997 --> 11:38.766
and I'm losing my hair.

11:38.766 --> 11:41.334
This.
This isn't real.

11:41.368 --> 11:44.972
I have to clip it on every day.
And for what?

11:45.005 --> 11:46.473
[grunts]

11:46.506 --> 11:48.641
Oh, and I brought your name up,

11:48.675 --> 11:50.477
by the way, to Trixie...
[scoffs and sniffles]

11:50.510 --> 11:52.079
You should have seen her face.

11:52.112 --> 11:54.581
- Really?
What kind of face?

11:54.614 --> 11:58.051
- Oh, my God, I just signed
a lease on that apartment

11:58.085 --> 12:00.353
that I could barely afford
on this crappy salary.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.989
[gasps]

12:02.022 --> 12:05.225
- Look, well, you are a goddess
to mention me to Trixie.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.294
Um, should I--
like, is there anyone

12:07.327 --> 12:09.062
I should follow up with or...

12:09.096 --> 12:11.164
- You know what,
I am just so grateful

12:11.198 --> 12:13.100
that you came in today.

12:13.133 --> 12:15.635
I could really use a drink
right now.

12:15.668 --> 12:18.005
- Oh, sure.
Okay.

12:18.038 --> 12:20.640
Let me just run to the bathroom
and make a quick call.

12:20.673 --> 12:23.076
My husband has the kids.
- Okay.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.612
- Okay.

12:25.645 --> 12:26.947
- [sobbing]

12:26.980 --> 12:30.450
- [screaming]
- [moaning]

12:30.483 --> 12:31.952
[soft music]

12:31.985 --> 12:33.153
- Oh, yeah.

12:34.855 --> 12:37.858
[indistinct chatter
and laughter]

12:40.828 --> 12:43.831
[rock music]

12:43.831 --> 12:51.638
*

12:51.671 --> 12:55.608
- High road, high road,
high road.

13:00.313 --> 13:00.480
- Hi.

13:02.415 --> 13:03.884
- Jill.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.853
- Simone, you're blonder.

13:05.853 --> 13:07.054
- Summer sun.
[dog barks]

13:07.087 --> 13:08.655
- And you have a dog.

13:08.688 --> 13:11.591
- It's a therapy dog
to help cure my narcissism.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.060
I was diagnosed in June.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.963
- Oh, well,
I'm glad you're getting help.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.630
Hi, Stephanie.
- Hi.

13:17.664 --> 13:19.466
- And we haven't met yet.
I'm Jill.

13:19.499 --> 13:20.467
- Janice.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.869
- J'neece is bringing

13:21.869 --> 13:24.504
an urban perspective
to my label.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.339
We were just meeting
with the fashion editors

13:26.373 --> 13:27.374
about my new line.

13:27.407 --> 13:28.741
It's very exciting.

13:28.775 --> 13:30.077
What brings you here?

13:30.110 --> 13:31.945
- I used to work here,
actually.

13:31.979 --> 13:34.747
An old friend is hiring me
for some photo shoots.

13:34.781 --> 13:36.884
I'm getting back in the game.

13:36.884 --> 13:39.019
- Jill, I'm not even getting
an exit interview.

13:39.052 --> 13:41.454
[sniffling]
They just confiscated my ID.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.156
- Um, can I meet you
in the lobby?

13:43.190 --> 13:46.259
It'll just take a minute.
- Okay.

13:46.293 --> 13:47.660
[crying]

13:47.694 --> 13:49.496
- Yikes.

13:49.529 --> 13:50.898
Guys, can you give us a minute?

13:50.898 --> 13:52.332
- Sure thing.

13:53.800 --> 13:56.503
- So, Brooke,
I just wanted to say--

13:56.536 --> 13:58.438
- Are you power-posing?

13:58.471 --> 14:01.674
No, that's over.
It's all about eye contact now.

14:01.708 --> 14:03.010
- Oh.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.512
Well, anyway,
I just wanted to say--

14:05.545 --> 14:08.248
- Jill, you and I had
a hard moment,

14:08.281 --> 14:11.384
but we're family,
so I'm taking the high road,

14:11.418 --> 14:13.253
and I invite you to join me.

14:13.286 --> 14:16.289
- I'm pretty sure that if you
say you're taking the high road,

14:16.323 --> 14:19.192
you're automatically not
on the high road.

14:19.226 --> 14:21.962
- Yet, somehow,
I've managed to do both.

14:21.995 --> 14:24.631
- You may be on the high road,
but I was already on it,

14:24.664 --> 14:26.266
and it's, like,
a one-lane thing.

14:26.299 --> 14:27.400
- [scoffs]
Sweetie,

14:27.434 --> 14:29.636
as the "Joy Manifesto" says,

14:29.669 --> 14:31.939
"Forward is upward."

14:31.939 --> 14:34.074
Thanks to "Joy"
I have manifested

14:34.107 --> 14:36.243
an entirely new philosophy.

14:36.276 --> 14:39.947
Women need to stick together
to demand equal pay,

14:39.947 --> 14:42.715
equal rights,
equal everything.

14:42.749 --> 14:46.086
It's what I am calling
"Shedonism."

14:46.119 --> 14:47.720
- You mean Feminism.

14:47.754 --> 14:49.722
- Ew, no, I wax down there.

14:49.756 --> 14:53.593
Guys, I'm gonna have
to meet you in the lobby.

14:53.626 --> 14:56.463
J'neece is such
a breath of fresh air.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.165
I didn't want my company to be

14:58.198 --> 15:00.233
as white as the Upper East Side,
you know?

15:00.267 --> 15:02.970
- Yeah,
but Janice doesn't look--

15:03.003 --> 15:04.137
- It's J'neece,

15:04.171 --> 15:07.207
and I don't see color.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.676
I'll see you at drop-off, Jill.

15:10.677 --> 15:11.979
[cell phone buzzing]

15:11.979 --> 15:13.813
- Who the hell keeps calling me?
Hello?

15:13.846 --> 15:16.149
- Hi, this is Kelly
from daycare.

15:16.183 --> 15:18.718
We're having some
behavior issues with your son.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.187
You need to come pick him up.

15:20.220 --> 15:21.854
- Sorry, my son's not
in daycare.

15:21.888 --> 15:24.224
I think you have
the wrong number.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.093
- Is that who I think it is?

15:26.126 --> 15:28.028
*

15:28.061 --> 15:31.198
Jill, were you really going
to come all the way down here

15:31.231 --> 15:32.499
and not say hello?

15:32.532 --> 15:34.601
- Of course not.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.503
- My last assistant was worse.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.605
I would look at her
and she would cry.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.107
I would yell at her
and she would cry.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.908
I would hit her
and she would cry.

15:42.009 --> 15:44.844
These millennials,
they're made of glass.

15:44.877 --> 15:47.280
Sack up.
I'm not running a nursery.

15:47.314 --> 15:50.117
- Seriously.
What is their problem.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.452
[both laugh softly]
[cell phone buzzes]

15:52.485 --> 15:54.087
- Hello, it's Kelly
from the daycare center.

15:54.121 --> 15:55.588
- Sorry, sorry sorry.
- It's about your--

15:55.622 --> 15:58.091
- So tell me, Jill,
did you end up keeping the baby.

15:58.125 --> 16:01.428
- Uh, yeah, we'd been trying
for two years,

16:01.461 --> 16:03.763
and I had two more, actually.

16:03.796 --> 16:07.034
- Three children?
Oh, Jill, what a waste.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.536
No wonder you
dropped off the map.

16:09.569 --> 16:13.806
- Um, well, I'm actually getting
back into the photography thing,

16:13.840 --> 16:18.178
so I hope you'll keep me in mind
for any work that comes up.

16:18.211 --> 16:20.447
[cell phone buzzes]

16:20.480 --> 16:22.182
- Jill, I'm tired of
sugar-coating everything

16:22.215 --> 16:24.151
with you;
may I be candid?

16:24.184 --> 16:26.186
When I think of you,
which isn't very often,

16:26.219 --> 16:28.655
I think of an A-plus student.

16:28.688 --> 16:30.890
You fulfilled every assignment,

16:30.923 --> 16:33.293
and wrapped everything
in neat little bows.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.628
- I do have a thing for bows.

16:35.662 --> 16:36.963
- But your work was safe.

16:37.064 --> 16:40.700
It had no teeth or balls,
really.

16:40.733 --> 16:42.502
Which always puzzled me

16:42.535 --> 16:45.505
because you're obviously
a colorful person,

16:45.538 --> 16:48.308
but that moxie never showed up
in the work.

16:48.341 --> 16:51.344
[cell phone buzzing]

16:58.451 --> 16:59.886
You wanna get that?

16:59.919 --> 17:03.123
Answering phones was always
one of your strengths.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.095
- [quietly]
Hello?

17:11.264 --> 17:11.964
- And downstairs,
there's a pool,

17:13.266 --> 17:14.534
tennis bubble,

17:14.567 --> 17:15.735
and screening room

17:15.768 --> 17:18.405
with a classic film series
this month.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.440
"Caddyshack" is playing tonight.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.275
- I can see
why you never want to leave.

17:22.309 --> 17:24.744
Can I get divorced?
[chuckles]

17:24.777 --> 17:28.115
Sorry, I'm--actually,
I should check in with Jill.

17:28.115 --> 17:29.782
- Yeah, that's good.
[clears throat]

17:29.816 --> 17:32.819
It's cool you still have
a wife you can check in on.

17:34.121 --> 17:35.522
- You okay, Lex?

17:35.555 --> 17:37.424
- Yeah, no, um...
[clears throat]

17:37.457 --> 17:39.259
I'm not.

17:39.292 --> 17:42.195
I send Brooke flowers
at least once a day.

17:42.229 --> 17:44.597
She never accepts them.

17:44.631 --> 17:48.135
She blocked me on Facebook.

17:48.135 --> 17:49.602
I'm all alone here.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.438
- Brooke will come around.

17:51.471 --> 17:55.375
She will, and until then,
try to enjoy all of this

17:55.408 --> 17:56.943
for both of us.

17:56.976 --> 17:59.412
- Good-bye, Jasper.
Good-bye, Atticus.

17:59.446 --> 18:01.448
See you in two Wednesdays.

18:01.481 --> 18:04.484
We'll go to Fred's at Barneys
for that truffle pizza you like.

18:04.517 --> 18:06.018
Daddy loves you.

18:06.052 --> 18:08.155
- Is your boo-boo better, angel?

18:08.155 --> 18:10.523
I'm gonna put my lips
to the screen for a kiss,

18:10.557 --> 18:12.525
and you put your lips
to the screen.

18:14.494 --> 18:16.429
- I have to get the kids.

18:19.699 --> 18:22.001
Everybody's gone.
Where are my kids?

18:22.034 --> 18:23.670
I lost the kids.
Jill's gonna rip me a new--

18:23.703 --> 18:25.172
- There you are.
- Where're my children?

18:25.205 --> 18:27.174
Are they okay?
- Yes, everyone's fine.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.242
They're with their mother.
- No!

18:29.276 --> 18:31.811
That's almost worse
than if they'd been abducted.

18:31.844 --> 18:34.881
- Oh, well, your son had
some impulse control issues

18:34.914 --> 18:36.649
and when we couldn't reach
either of you,

18:36.683 --> 18:38.351
your daughter gave us
your ex's number.

18:38.385 --> 18:39.752
- My ex?
No, she's not my ex.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.821
Did she say she's my ex?

18:41.854 --> 18:44.357
- No, I just assumed.

18:44.391 --> 18:47.227
- [exhales]
- Dude, you're in trouble.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.996
Movie night starts at 8:00,
if you need a place to crash.

18:50.029 --> 18:51.364
*

18:52.699 --> 18:54.667
- Okay, you can be
mad at me forever,

18:54.701 --> 18:57.003
just please don't divorce me.

18:57.036 --> 18:58.738
- Yeah, I'm over it.
- Really?

18:58.771 --> 19:00.940
But you had to leave
a Trixie meeting because of me.

19:00.973 --> 19:04.211
- Can you believe she said
my work had no balls?

19:04.211 --> 19:06.846
- Has she met you?
Your balls have balls.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.848
- Honestly,
I was secretly relieved

19:08.881 --> 19:11.017
that you needed a break
from the kids too.

19:11.050 --> 19:12.018
- Are you kidding?

19:12.051 --> 19:13.019
At one point in the day,

19:13.052 --> 19:14.454
I realized I hated all of them.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.623
- [laughs softly]
Welcome to motherhood, honey.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.491
- Yeah.

19:18.525 --> 19:19.626
Mm.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.494
- Say it again.

19:21.528 --> 19:23.896
- Our kids are
incredibly annoying.

19:23.930 --> 19:24.897
- More.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.233
- I wanted to put them

19:26.233 --> 19:28.435
in three tiny
straightjackets.

19:28.468 --> 19:29.869
[cell phone ringing]

19:29.902 --> 19:33.340
[sighs]
- Oh, this'll just be a minute.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.542
Hi.
- Take your time.

19:35.575 --> 19:36.843
I'm already asleep.

19:36.876 --> 19:39.646
Night, Vanessa.
- Okay, where were we?

19:39.679 --> 19:40.913
- You'd just gotten up
to Brooke's new acolyte.

19:40.947 --> 19:41.948
- Right!

19:41.981 --> 19:43.149
Okay, I know this is

19:43.250 --> 19:45.151
gonna sound weird,
but I get the feeling

19:45.252 --> 19:47.554
that Brooke thinks she
has a new black friend.

19:47.587 --> 19:49.622
- She doesn't?
- Oh, no, she has a new friend.

19:49.656 --> 19:53.260
I met her, but I'm pretty sure
she's just a white chick

19:53.260 --> 19:54.561
who doesn't Keratin.

19:54.594 --> 19:56.396
- [laughs]

19:56.429 --> 19:59.566
- Okay, Vaness,
in exactly eight hours,

19:59.599 --> 20:04.036
I'm dropping off all my kids
at real, full-time school.

20:04.070 --> 20:06.873
Finally, I'm done.
I'm done with diapers.

20:06.906 --> 20:09.242
I'm done with sippy cups.
I'm done.

20:09.276 --> 20:11.678
- You realize they're not going
to boarding school, right?

20:11.711 --> 20:14.381
- Vaness, this is why you have
to have kids,

20:14.414 --> 20:17.250
so you can experience
the jubilation

20:17.284 --> 20:19.452
of handing them off
to other people.

20:19.486 --> 20:20.887
- [laughs]

20:20.920 --> 20:21.954
- I feel like
I've been running a marathon,

20:21.988 --> 20:24.391
and now I'm at the finish line.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.493
- Mazel.

20:26.526 --> 20:29.262
- * Going back to school again

[cheers and applause]

20:54.821 --> 20:57.824
[cell phone ringing]

21:01.060 --> 21:02.662
- Hello?
- Mrs. Weber?

21:02.695 --> 21:04.331
You forgot the doctor's forms.

21:04.364 --> 21:06.699
- I forgot what?
- The medical forms.

21:06.733 --> 21:09.201
Hazel can't start school
without it.

21:09.235 --> 21:11.971
She's waiting here
in the administrative office.

21:12.004 --> 21:13.840
- Be right there.

21:23.450 --> 21:26.419
- For more "Odd Mom Out" go

21:30.357 --> 21:32.158
- Left, right,
left, right, left, right!
