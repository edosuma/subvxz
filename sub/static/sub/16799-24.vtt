WEBVTT

00:01.330 --> 00:02.763
Previously on Elementary...

00:02.800 --> 00:04.768
You are Halcon Zelaya,
leader of your gang, Mara Tres.

00:04.800 --> 00:06.233
(Holmes grunts)

00:06.270 --> 00:07.532
Shinwell will not help himself.

00:07.570 --> 00:08.764
He just wants to hurt others.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.132
I've become quite certain
that in the end

00:11.170 --> 00:12.205
he'll hurt you as well.

00:12.240 --> 00:14.174
Shinwell.

00:14.210 --> 00:15.336
GREGSON: We're gonna find
the guy who did this.

00:15.380 --> 00:16.540
Tomorrow morning we go to war

00:16.580 --> 00:18.047
with one of New York's
deadliest gangs.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.514
You didn't send me
a text yesterday?
No.

00:20.550 --> 00:22.484
I-I didn't
recognize the number,

00:22.520 --> 00:24.147
but I thought maybe
you switched phones.

00:24.190 --> 00:25.680
You wanted to see me?

00:25.720 --> 00:28.484
I had to lie to a colleague of
mine today about this-this text.

00:28.520 --> 00:29.726
That can't happen again.

00:29.760 --> 00:31.625
Then stop ignoring me.
Or what?

00:31.660 --> 00:33.321
Things will get worse.

00:33.360 --> 00:35.191
WATSON: Tyus Wilcox
has been running

00:35.230 --> 00:37.425
one of the most dangerous gangs
in New York for a decade.

00:37.470 --> 00:38.596
I'm an innocent man.

00:38.630 --> 00:40.598
Until we prove you guilty.

00:49.550 --> 00:52.542
Whiffle ball, bullet casing,
pink barrette,

00:52.580 --> 00:54.639
licorice stick,
audio cassette tape,

00:54.680 --> 00:56.682
counterfeit lottery ticket,
bulldog clip,

00:56.720 --> 00:59.553
yellow handkerchief, matchbook.

01:00.660 --> 01:02.628
Iron-on patch.

01:14.640 --> 01:16.631
WATSON:
Sherlock.

01:24.480 --> 01:26.141
(grunts)

01:30.290 --> 01:31.848
You get my messages?

01:31.890 --> 01:33.448
Yeah. You and Marcus thought

01:33.490 --> 01:34.514
that you could prove
Bonzi Folsom

01:34.560 --> 01:36.425
murdered Carol Logan.

01:36.460 --> 01:37.484
Before you could
obtain a DNA sample,

01:37.530 --> 01:38.519
he was poisoned by his brother.

01:38.560 --> 01:39.697
I'm quite up to speed.

01:39.730 --> 01:42.619
I need to ask you a question

01:42.670 --> 01:44.592
and it's very important
that you tell me the truth.

01:45.770 --> 01:47.567
Are you using again?

01:47.600 --> 01:49.636
Why would you ask me that?

01:49.670 --> 01:51.661
You seem distracted lately.

01:51.710 --> 01:53.507
The morning after
Shinwell was killed,

01:53.540 --> 01:55.235
right before we were gonna
start to investigate,

01:55.280 --> 01:56.599
you left to go to a meeting.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.470
This afternoon
you were gone for hours.

01:58.510 --> 02:00.171
The last few weeks, you've been
sleeping a lot more.

02:00.220 --> 02:02.313
Yeah, well,
I'm not a machine, Watson.

02:02.350 --> 02:04.580
I must sleep on occasion.

02:10.930 --> 02:13.148
Do you want to see
between my toes as well?

02:13.200 --> 02:14.724
Hmm? Do you want?

02:14.760 --> 02:18.560
This thing that we started with
SBK, I cannot do it on my own.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.261
I need your help.

02:20.300 --> 02:22.530
Yeah, well, I'm at
your disposal, Watson.

02:22.570 --> 02:25.130
Well, there's nothing else
we can do tonight.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.801
Besides, I need to sleep.

02:28.840 --> 02:30.307
I'm not a machine, either.

02:33.720 --> 02:37.281
*

02:50.670 --> 02:53.696
Yo, Duane.

02:53.740 --> 02:55.332
It's a party, man.
Loosen up.

02:57.740 --> 02:59.537
It's just weird, is all.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.935
Bonzi in the hospital
and everything.

03:01.980 --> 03:05.370
Yo, our boy, Lamar, got
out from Rikers today.

03:05.410 --> 03:07.378
No way we wasn't
gonna celebrate.

03:07.420 --> 03:09.411
*

03:11.590 --> 03:13.911
Got a message
from Tall Boy today.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.655
He was careful.

03:15.690 --> 03:16.782
It came through his lavwer.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.457
Levine?

03:18.490 --> 03:20.651
Nah, the other one. Grimaldi.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.327
Tall Boy gave him a name.

03:22.370 --> 03:23.860
Joan Watson.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.868
Said she works
for the police,

03:25.900 --> 03:28.789
but that she isn't police.

03:28.840 --> 03:32.230
He thinks she the one
got Shinwell to turn snitch.

03:34.340 --> 03:35.807
Tall Boy say where to find her?

03:35.840 --> 03:40.641
No... but Grimaldi
dug up an address.

03:42.750 --> 03:44.843
SOCKS:
If we go pay her a visit
right now...

03:46.520 --> 03:49.250
...you gonna cheer up?

03:49.290 --> 03:51.349
(gunfire)
(woman screaming)

03:58.400 --> 04:01.733
*

04:31.430 --> 04:32.829
GREGSON: This one was an SBK
lieutenant, Darion Barber.

04:32.870 --> 04:36.033
His gang name was Socks.

04:36.070 --> 04:39.801
A little after 11:00 p.m.,
three gunmen opened fire

04:39.840 --> 04:41.728
with automatic weapons,
killing Mr. Barber,

04:41.780 --> 04:44.044
five of his SBK associates,

04:44.080 --> 04:46.810
two of their girlfriends
and two children.

04:47.880 --> 04:49.416
Safe to assume the shooters

04:49.450 --> 04:50.781
were also gang affiliated?

04:50.820 --> 04:52.014
Mara Tres.

04:52.050 --> 04:53.085
At least that's what
we have to assume

04:53.120 --> 04:54.656
off their descriptions.

04:54.690 --> 04:56.954
Mara Tres and SBK
are longtime rivals.

04:56.990 --> 05:00.391
They've gotten into scraps about
territory over the years,

05:00.430 --> 05:03.968
a beatdown here, a drive-by
there, but nothing like this.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.661
There's only one way to read it.

05:05.700 --> 05:07.338
Declaration of war.

05:07.370 --> 05:09.031
BELL: Got to
figure they heard

05:09.070 --> 05:10.799
about Bonzi Folsom overdosing,

05:10.840 --> 05:13.502
thought they'd hit SBK
while they're down.

05:13.540 --> 05:14.973
The department's at DEFCON 1.

05:15.010 --> 05:17.376
Obviously, SBK is gonna want
to retaliate,

05:17.410 --> 05:19.378
blood for blood.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.614
We've got extra units patrolling
both of their territories,

05:20.650 --> 05:23.881
but I think we all know that
the next move is in the hands

05:23.920 --> 05:25.581
of just one guy.

05:25.620 --> 05:27.053
Tyus Wilcox.

05:27.090 --> 05:28.785
GREGSON: I want to have
a chat with him,

05:28.820 --> 05:30.822
explain that it's
in everyone's best interest

05:30.860 --> 05:32.657
to let us take things from here.

05:32.700 --> 05:35.828
With your permission, I'd like
to do some talking of my own.
To?

05:35.860 --> 05:39.489
Julio "Halcon" Zelaya,
the leader of Mara Tres.

05:39.540 --> 05:40.893
I did some work
for him once.

05:40.940 --> 05:43.363
Provided I could find him,
I would let him know

05:43.410 --> 05:44.729
that the department
already has SBK

05:44.770 --> 05:46.499
firmly in their crosshairs.

05:46.540 --> 05:49.373
What I won't mention is that
he and his people will be next.

05:49.410 --> 05:50.502
That is, of course,

05:50.550 --> 05:51.505
ifI have _ _
my partner's permussron

05:51.550 --> 05:52.574
to be away for a while.

05:54.780 --> 05:56.441
Be careful.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.591
May the Lord be in your heart

06:14.640 --> 06:17.768
and help you to confess
your sins with great sorrow.

06:17.810 --> 06:20.108
You first, Father Baldomero.

06:20.140 --> 06:21.778
Excuse me?

06:21.810 --> 06:23.698
For years now,
you've used your church

06:23.750 --> 06:24.648
to help a powerful drug gang

06:24.680 --> 06:25.999
launder their money.

06:26.050 --> 06:27.938
I'm curious.

06:27.980 --> 06:29.709
How many Hail Marys does it take

06:29.750 --> 06:31.786
to wash away
something like that?

06:31.820 --> 06:36.928
I'm sorry, my son, I don't know
what you're talking about.

06:36.960 --> 06:38.484
"Drug gang"?

06:38.530 --> 06:40.725
Hmm, Mara Tres.
It's an open secret

06:40.760 --> 06:42.967
you have an arrangement with
their leader, Halcon Zelaya.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.025
He makes large donations
to your parish

06:45.070 --> 06:49.097
and you return them to him
clean, minus ten percent.

06:49.140 --> 06:50.937
Now, to your credit, you
use the bulk of that money

06:50.970 --> 06:52.676
to make improvements
to your church

06:52.710 --> 06:54.507
and its ministry
with the poor,

06:54.540 --> 06:56.770
but I'll wager you're the
only priest on the planet

06:56.810 --> 06:59.973
with a canary yellow Porsche in
a secret garage in Mount Kisco.

07:00.020 --> 07:05.617
If everything you are
saying were true...

07:05.650 --> 07:09.051
I would be a very dangerous
priest, wouldn't I?

07:09.090 --> 07:12.218
I need you to get a message
to Halcon.

07:12.260 --> 07:15.491
You tell him Sherlock Holmes

07:15.530 --> 07:19.762
says a war with SBK
isn't necessary.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.495
He'll have their territory
soon enough.

07:21.540 --> 07:23.667
What does that mean?

07:23.710 --> 07:26.599
It means my partner and I
declared war on them first.

07:26.640 --> 07:28.232
We're working with the police
to dismantle them.

07:28.280 --> 07:31.249
We just need a
little more time.

07:31.280 --> 07:33.248
Halcon knows me
and he knows my methods.

07:33.280 --> 07:36.886
When I say SBK will be gone,
he can take that as a fact.

07:36.920 --> 07:40.515
And when... can I tell him

07:40.560 --> 07:43.051
that you have set
your sights on him?

07:43.090 --> 07:46.992
The message,
see that he gets it.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.835
I'm sorry.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.906
I think what happened
to these people is a tragedy,

08:02.950 --> 08:05.805
but I don't know them.

08:05.850 --> 08:07.647
Look closer.

08:09.720 --> 08:12.689
I've been very patient
with you people,

08:12.720 --> 08:13.857
but enough is enough.

08:13.890 --> 08:15.687
I don't appreciate

08:15.720 --> 08:17.221
you coming into my office.

08:17.260 --> 08:19.182
I don't appreciate you
showing me images like these.

08:19.230 --> 08:20.652
GREGSON:
Cut the crap, okay?

08:20.700 --> 08:22.827
We know you run SBK.

08:22.870 --> 08:25.191
And if you didn't want to have
to deal with visits like this

08:25.230 --> 08:26.993
or look at pictures like that,

08:27.040 --> 08:29.759
you probably shouldn't have
poisoned your own brother.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.266
Heaw is the head, huh?

08:33.210 --> 08:35.075
Bonzi hasn't been gone 24 hours

08:35.110 --> 08:37.544
and another gang has already
declared war on you.

08:37.580 --> 08:39.502
It's got to be a record.

08:41.580 --> 08:45.289
Okay, let's pretend
you're right about me.

08:45.320 --> 08:47.788
I'm the head of a street gang
that got attacked

08:47.820 --> 08:50.948
by another street gang
last night.

08:50.990 --> 08:53.595
Things like that
can't go unanswered.

08:53.630 --> 08:57.225
They can and if you want to keep
running SBK, they should.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.226
Explain that.

08:59.270 --> 09:02.933
Wa_rs like the one Mara Tres is
trying to start, they're messy.

09:02.970 --> 09:04.665
Disruptive.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.974
You can't hide in
the shadows anymore.

09:07.010 --> 09:10.104
You got to get down in the
trenches, get your hands dirty,

09:10.150 --> 09:14.268
but, Tyus, remember...
we're already gunning for you.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.982
If you order some
sort of retaliation,

09:17.020 --> 09:18.715
do you think
it's gonna get easier

09:18.750 --> 09:21.958
to hide who you really are
or harder?

09:21.990 --> 09:23.127
(chuckles)

09:23.160 --> 09:26.891
If I were the leader of SBK,

09:26.930 --> 09:30.969
you'd have given me
a lot to think about.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.299
But since I'm not,
I can only pray that

09:34.340 --> 09:36.661
the police find the people
behind all this bloodshed

09:36.710 --> 09:40.908
quickly, because you're right.

09:40.940 --> 09:44.205
Wars like the one you're
talking about, they get messy.

09:44.250 --> 09:47.174
Police could get killed,

09:47.220 --> 09:50.212
maybe even civilians.

09:50.250 --> 09:52.753
Now, if you'll excuse me...

09:54.790 --> 09:57.953
...I got a real job to do.

10:23.050 --> 10:25.245
Well, this is unexpected.

10:28.260 --> 10:32.651
I found your little
mystery boxes downstairs.

10:32.700 --> 10:35.351
I'm curious.

10:35.400 --> 10:39.291
Which one will you
open tonight?

10:39.330 --> 10:41.764
What do you think
youWIﬁnd?

10:41.800 --> 10:43.961
Why are you here?

10:44.010 --> 10:46.808
I'm here because I've realized

10:46.840 --> 10:49.377
this isn't gonna work.

10:49.410 --> 10:51.742
I love you.

10:51.780 --> 10:54.317
I want to help you,
but you won't let me.

10:54.350 --> 10:57.945
This is helpful, is it?
Coming here?

10:57.990 --> 10:59.389
Coming to the places I work?

10:59.420 --> 11:01.285
Why won't you tell Joan
about me?

11:01.320 --> 11:03.823
Because you're none
of her concern.

11:03.860 --> 11:06.055
You're a terrible liar.

11:07.930 --> 11:10.694
This is your last chance,
Sherlock.

11:10.730 --> 11:13.198
Do the right thing.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.299
Do what needs to be done.

11:15.340 --> 11:17.001
Or what?

11:17.040 --> 11:19.736
Or you'll never see me again.

11:19.780 --> 11:22.374
(doorbell rings)

11:24.450 --> 11:25.849
Gentlemen.

11:29.520 --> 11:31.886
* Rob a bank
before the day I go broke *

11:31.920 --> 11:34.059
* Let's see how much
money we can take *

11:34.090 --> 11:37.025
* Is this only answered
when they croak? *

11:37.060 --> 11:39.085
* Show me how much money
you can make *

11:39.130 --> 11:40.859
* Rob a bank before
the day I go broke *

11:40.900 --> 11:43.095
* Let's see how much
money we can take. *

11:56.080 --> 11:58.446
I appreciate not being
put in the trunk this time.

11:58.480 --> 12:01.176
Me and my men won't
be here for very long,

12:01.220 --> 12:04.815
so who cares if you
know where you are?

12:06.990 --> 12:09.151
I hoped my message
would convince you

12:09.190 --> 12:11.249
that additional bloodshed
wasn't necessary,

12:11.290 --> 12:13.997
but there appears to be
a dead body in that box.

12:18.870 --> 12:23.068
See? That's why
I wanted to talk to you.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.759
Because you keep
getting things wrong.

12:26.540 --> 12:28.974
You think I got somebody
from SBK in that box,

12:29.010 --> 12:31.308
only I don't.

12:31.350 --> 12:35.070
You think we started a war
with those boys last night,

12:35.120 --> 12:37.008
but we didn't.

12:37.050 --> 12:38.312
The three men
who attacked the party

12:38.350 --> 12:40.386
had very distinctive
facial tattoos.

12:43.030 --> 12:44.918
You're not listening.

12:44.960 --> 12:48.191
I'm not saying
we didn't do it.

12:48.230 --> 12:50.460
I'm saying we didn't start it.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.388
What happened
last night,

12:52.430 --> 12:54.569
that was retaliation.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.488
For what?

12:56.540 --> 12:58.508
(lid creaks)

13:04.980 --> 13:09.041
My sister. Carmen.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.480
Yesterday, this box
ends up outside the house

13:11.520 --> 13:14.114
of an attorney I know.

13:14.160 --> 13:15.252
He does real estate.

13:15.290 --> 13:19.829
Finds places for us
to put our money.

13:19.860 --> 13:22.556
I didn't think anybody
knew about him.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.966
But, obviously, SBK did.

13:25.000 --> 13:30.233
Somebody taped a DVD
to the outside...

13:30.270 --> 13:34.036
wrote "Halcon" on the sleeve.

13:36.480 --> 13:40.075
This thing that I do...

13:40.120 --> 13:43.840
she didn't have nothing
to do with it.

13:43.890 --> 13:47.348
Her soul, it was...

13:47.390 --> 13:50.029
It was clean.

13:52.190 --> 13:54.351
Thanks for sending me
your message.

13:54.400 --> 13:57.494
Now I got a message for you.

13:57.530 --> 14:00.169
Stay out of my way.

14:00.200 --> 14:02.134
And tell your people
to let me do

14:02.170 --> 14:05.139
what I need to do to SBK.

14:05.170 --> 14:07.968
Because I promise you...

14:08.010 --> 14:09.477
I'm not gonna stop until every
last one of them is dead.

14:20.960 --> 14:25.158
(frightened sobbing)

14:25.190 --> 14:27.954
My name is Carmen Zelaya.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.889
This message is for
my brother, Julio.

14:30.930 --> 14:33.990
"You have disrespected SBK.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.634
"For years you have gone
where we told you not to,

14:36.670 --> 14:40.572
"and you have taken
what is ours.

14:40.610 --> 14:43.602
"It stops today.

14:46.450 --> 14:50.409
Today we take something
from you."

14:50.450 --> 14:54.159
Is that the whole thing?
Yeah.

14:54.190 --> 14:56.579
There didn't appear to be
any fingerprints on the disc,

14:56.620 --> 14:58.087
but it should go to
the lab all the same.

14:58.130 --> 15:00.325
You said you saw the body?

15:00.360 --> 15:02.328
I did. After two days
in the box,

15:02.360 --> 15:04.419
the features had
distorted somewhat,

15:04.470 --> 15:06.995
but there was no doubt it was
the woman in that video.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.689
She'd been stabbed in the heart.

15:08.740 --> 15:10.230
GREGSON: Someone kills
this guy's sister,

15:10.270 --> 15:11.703
sends him her in a box,

15:11.740 --> 15:13.332
and he doesn't call
the police?

15:13.380 --> 15:14.574
Is he crazy?

15:14.610 --> 15:16.237
Among other things.

15:16.280 --> 15:18.271
He was a violent psychopath
before Carmen's murder.

15:18.310 --> 15:20.540
Now her death has
inspired a madness

15:20.580 --> 15:22.013
which would flatter
Ivan the Terrible.

15:22.050 --> 15:24.416
We should get ESU
over to that garage.

15:24.450 --> 15:25.940
You can, but he made it
quite clear

15:25.990 --> 15:27.218
he would not be staying there.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.386
By the time
they get there,

15:28.420 --> 15:29.387
him and his men and his sister

15:29.420 --> 15:30.250
will be long gone.

15:30.290 --> 15:32.224
What do you mean
his sister will be gone?

15:32.260 --> 15:33.591
He plans on keeping
her remains with him

15:33.630 --> 15:35.951
until SBK has been eradicated.

15:36.000 --> 15:36.819
Why?

15:36.860 --> 15:39.192
As a reminder to his men
and to himself

15:39.230 --> 15:40.697
that there can be no mercy,

15:40.740 --> 15:42.298
that SBK must pay
for what they've done,

15:42.340 --> 15:43.659
and pay horribly.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.928
Assuming they're even
the ones who killed her.

15:47.110 --> 15:49.271
The last few days,
we've had SBK on the run.

15:49.310 --> 15:51.471
They're weaker than they've
been in a long time.

15:51.510 --> 15:53.978
So why would they start a war
with a gang

15:54.020 --> 15:55.749
as powerful as Mara Tres?

15:55.780 --> 15:57.418
And if they did,
why didn't they choose

15:57.450 --> 15:59.543
a safer place to have
their party last night?

15:59.590 --> 16:01.615
We're talking about a street
gang, not an investment bank.

16:01.660 --> 16:04.356
They can't always be expected
to make the right play.

16:04.390 --> 16:05.652
Actually, I agree with Watson.

16:05.690 --> 16:07.328
I think SBK's being framed.

16:07.360 --> 16:08.622
By who?

16:08.660 --> 16:10.127
By another gang--
someone who'd benefit

16:10.170 --> 16:11.762
from the two of them
destroying one another.

16:11.800 --> 16:15.338
Or a faction inside Mara Tres
that's pushing Halcon

16:15.370 --> 16:17.008
to take action
against their rivals.

16:17.040 --> 16:18.632
Whoever it is,
I think the ball is

16:18.670 --> 16:20.672
squarely in Tyus Wilcox's court.

16:20.710 --> 16:24.043
I want to have
another chat with him.

16:25.680 --> 16:28.410
HOLMES: Let me guess,
you've never seen her before.

16:28.450 --> 16:29.644
Just as you didn't
order Shinwell's death,

16:29.680 --> 16:31.648
and you didn't spike

16:31.690 --> 16:33.351
your brother's
cocaine stash.

16:33.390 --> 16:35.483
You people keep talking
to me like I'm a gangbanger.

16:35.520 --> 16:38.387
But I've told you before,
I'm a businessman.

16:38.430 --> 16:40.022
GREGSON:
Enough.

16:40.060 --> 16:40.799
You don't want to say out loud

16:40.830 --> 16:43.264
that you run SBK--
we get it.

16:43.300 --> 16:46.064
But ten people are dead,
and two of them are kids.

16:46.100 --> 16:48.762
So if we double-pinlq promise
not to arrest you

16:48.800 --> 16:51.030
for saying something
we all know is true,

16:51.070 --> 16:54.073
are you finally gonna
start talking to us like a man?

17:01.080 --> 17:03.048
Halcon really thinks
we killed her?

17:03.090 --> 17:03.909
He does.

17:06.220 --> 17:09.758
About ten years ago,
Bonzi came to me,

17:09.790 --> 17:11.621
said he needed my help.

17:11.660 --> 17:14.128
He'd only been running
SBK a couple years.

17:14.160 --> 17:16.253
He thought he might be
in over his head

17:16.300 --> 17:19.758
on a few things, so I gave him
some business advice.

17:19.800 --> 17:21.734
It worked. He started coming
to me more and more.

17:21.770 --> 17:24.807
I started treating him
like any other client.

17:24.840 --> 17:27.104
In exchange
for helping him,

17:27.140 --> 17:28.778
I took a percentage
of what he made.

17:28.810 --> 17:30.607
You're a consulting gangster.

17:30.650 --> 17:33.448
Eventually,
we became partners.

17:33.480 --> 17:35.516
But the partnership was
predicated on certain rules.

17:35.550 --> 17:40.089
One of those rules was
do not mess with Halcon Zelaya.

17:40.120 --> 17:41.348
SBK and Mara Tres
have been involved

17:41.390 --> 17:43.153
in multiple skirmishes
over the years.

17:43.190 --> 17:44.782
That's different.
That's business.

17:44.830 --> 17:47.094
Halcon gets business.

17:47.130 --> 17:48.654
What_ we didn't want was
for things to get personal,

17:48.700 --> 17:50.463
because we couldn't win.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.161
Not against that kind of crazy.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.861
We never would have
signed off

17:53.900 --> 17:55.299
on hurting his sister.

17:55.340 --> 17:57.205
Well, as a matter of fact,
we believe you.

17:57.240 --> 17:59.504
We think your gang is
being set up.

17:59.540 --> 18:01.735
The question is, by whom?

18:01.780 --> 18:04.101
You have multiple enemies
all over the city.

18:04.150 --> 18:07.313
We do.

18:07.350 --> 18:09.215
But I can't help wondering
if the person who did this

18:09.250 --> 18:10.740
is a friend.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.213
B_onzi and I would hear _
rumblings every once In a while.

18:13.260 --> 18:14.887
Some of our people thought
we were too hands-off

18:14.920 --> 18:16.717
when it came to Mara Tres.

18:16.760 --> 18:19.479
Could be one of them
that wanted to change that.

18:19.530 --> 18:21.225
We're gonna need names.

18:21.260 --> 18:22.591
I don't have any.

18:22.630 --> 18:24.769
The things we heard
came from our lieutenants.

18:24.800 --> 18:27.234
They just wanted us to know
there were bad feelings,

18:27.270 --> 18:28.760
but they didn't give anyone up.

18:28.800 --> 18:31.405
They didn't think
it was that serious.

18:31.440 --> 18:32.759
I'd say it's serious now,
wouldn't you?

18:32.810 --> 18:35.779
I'll talk to my guys,

18:35.810 --> 18:37.641
see if they know anything.

18:37.680 --> 18:40.342
Let's say they do.
Let's say they give you a name.

18:40.380 --> 18:41.779
Will you tell us?

18:41.820 --> 18:43.811
Will you tell Halcon?

18:43.850 --> 18:45.181
I can't imagine
either scenario would

18:45.220 --> 18:47.279
go down very well
with your constituents.

18:50.190 --> 18:54.820
All that matters
is ending the fighting.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.802
Did you tell Halcon about me?

19:03.840 --> 19:04.932
I did not.

19:04.970 --> 19:07.177
But should the unfriendliness

19:07.210 --> 19:10.338
between your two groups
persist, perhaps I will.

19:10.380 --> 19:13.872
As you say,
anything to stop the fighting.

19:22.490 --> 19:24.822
WOMAN:
Carmen's dead, isn't she?

19:24.860 --> 19:26.885
And that's why you're here?

19:28.830 --> 19:30.821
When was the last
time you saw her?

19:30.870 --> 19:33.896
Tuesday?

19:33.940 --> 19:35.430
Your roommate is
gone for days,

19:35.470 --> 19:37.609
but you don't
call the police?

19:37.640 --> 19:40.837
Our shifts are long,
and they don't always line up.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.734
And the way they schedule
the nurses,

19:42.780 --> 19:45.248
sometimes we go a whole week
without seeing each other.

19:45.280 --> 19:47.771
Tanya, you need to
stop lying to me.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.742
What?

19:49.780 --> 19:51.884
You're out of tissues,
your eyes were puffy

19:51.920 --> 19:52.841
when you answered the door.

19:52.890 --> 19:53.857
You've been
crying for days.

19:53.890 --> 19:55.312
You know something.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.782
You're right,
Carmen is dead.

19:56.820 --> 19:58.287
Someone stabbed her
in the heart.

19:58.330 --> 19:59.957
Do you really want
the person who did it

19:59.990 --> 20:01.594
to get away with it?

20:01.630 --> 20:04.269
Please, ifI talk
to the police,

20:04.300 --> 20:05.494
they will kill me.

20:05.530 --> 20:07.339
Who's "they"?

20:07.370 --> 20:09.338
Who are you afraid of?

20:11.010 --> 20:12.409
Mara Tres.

20:12.440 --> 20:15.739
Carmen's brother
runs Mara Tres.

20:15.780 --> 20:18.908
You don't think he wants
his sister's murder solved?

20:18.950 --> 20:21.839
He wants to solve it his way.

20:21.880 --> 20:23.518
He told me
to keep my mouth shut.

20:23.550 --> 20:25.438
His way got ten people killed

20:25.490 --> 20:26.639
the other night.

20:26.690 --> 20:27.987
You're a nurse, Tanya.

20:28.020 --> 20:29.908
So was Carmen.

20:29.960 --> 20:32.451
You really think
she'd be okay with that?

20:32.490 --> 20:34.890
(sighs)

20:34.930 --> 20:36.750
It was three nights ago.

20:36.800 --> 20:40.292
We'd gone out for coffee,
and we'd just gotten back

20:40.340 --> 20:44.367
when this... this guy
came up to us.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.708
He was wearing a ski mask,

20:46.740 --> 20:49.971
and he grabbed Carmen
and put a gun to her head.

20:50.010 --> 20:52.001
He said that
ifI called 911,

20:52.050 --> 20:53.813
he was gonna shoot her.

20:53.850 --> 20:55.715
He told me
to call her brother

20:55.750 --> 20:57.911
and tell him that she was gone,

20:57.950 --> 20:59.918
that he'd be in touch.

20:59.950 --> 21:02.009
Did you?

21:03.760 --> 21:06.854
Next day, Julio came here
with some men.

21:06.890 --> 21:09.688
I asked him if he had heard
from the kidnapper,

21:09.730 --> 21:12.893
but he just told me to stay
quiet about what happened.

21:12.930 --> 21:14.898
He said that Mara Tres
was handling it.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.760
Did he say anything else?

21:19.070 --> 21:21.903
Just that he knew
who was behind it.

21:21.940 --> 21:23.942
Another gang.

21:23.980 --> 21:26.403
But that didn't make
any sense to me.

21:26.450 --> 21:27.917
Why not?

21:27.950 --> 21:30.589
I grew up in Spanish Harlem.

21:30.620 --> 21:32.918
I know what a gangbanger
looks like,

21:32.950 --> 21:36.317
how they move, how they talk.

21:36.360 --> 21:37.987
And the guy that took Carmen...

21:38.030 --> 21:39.088
(exhales sharply)

21:39.130 --> 21:40.893
...he was different.

21:40.930 --> 21:42.056
What do you mean?

21:42.100 --> 21:45.661
He was dressed
like a gangbanger,

21:45.700 --> 21:48.999
basketball jersey, baggy pants.

21:49.040 --> 21:51.565
But he didn't have
any tattoos.

21:51.610 --> 21:54.773
Nothing on his arms,
nothing on his neck.

21:54.810 --> 21:58.075
And he didn't look
comfortable holding a gun.

21:58.110 --> 22:02.444
I don't know, maybe things
have changed since I was a kid.

22:02.480 --> 22:07.042
But if you ask me,
he wasn't in a gang.

22:09.560 --> 22:11.687
(door opens)

22:11.730 --> 22:14.551
Hi, how'd it go
with Tyus Wilcox?

22:14.600 --> 22:16.522
Better than expected.

22:16.560 --> 22:18.926
He seems to want to help.

22:18.970 --> 22:21.359
He thinks it's possible
Carmen Zelaya was killed

22:21.400 --> 22:24.369
by a rogue member of SBK,

22:24.410 --> 22:25.900
someone who wanted to settle
things between the gangs

22:25.940 --> 22:27.134
once and for all.

22:27.170 --> 22:29.001
Was he thinking
of someone in particular?

22:29.040 --> 22:30.769
No.

22:30.810 --> 22:32.675
He thinks one of his
lieutenants might know more.

22:32.710 --> 22:35.110
Well, maybe one of them
can help me find

22:35.150 --> 22:37.118
an SBK member
who doesn't have tattoos.

22:38.820 --> 22:40.082
_Carmen's roommate
was With her when she was taken.

22:40.120 --> 22:41.849
She said the guy
was wearing a mask,

22:41.890 --> 22:43.949
but his neck and arms
were exposed.

22:43.990 --> 22:45.389
And he had zero ink.

22:45.430 --> 22:46.249
So I've been
looking at guys

22:46.290 --> 22:47.598
from other gangs
who don't have tattoos.

22:47.630 --> 22:49.097
It's like they don't exist.

22:49.130 --> 22:52.566
Gang members and body art
do tend to go hand in hand.

22:52.600 --> 22:56.092
So, uh, there's gonna be
a memorial service for Shinwell

22:56.140 --> 22:58.131
this afternoon.

22:58.170 --> 23:00.138
I think we should go.

23:00.170 --> 23:01.102
You think that's wise?

23:01.140 --> 23:03.108
He was a gang member.

23:03.140 --> 23:04.607
Seems like an obvious place

23:04.650 --> 23:06.470
for Mara Tres
to launch another attack.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.671
I know. That's why I asked
the captain if he could park

23:08.720 --> 23:11.041
a couple of radio cars outside.

23:11.090 --> 23:12.819
That should keep it quiet
for a little while.

23:14.160 --> 23:16.412
Will you go with me?

23:16.460 --> 23:18.655
Yeah, of course.

23:18.690 --> 23:20.897
(phone ringing)

23:24.600 --> 23:26.488
Captain.

23:26.530 --> 23:28.634
GREGSON:
Tyus Wilcox is back.

23:28.670 --> 23:30.900
Did he find
a rogue member of SBK?

23:30.940 --> 23:33.135
Matter of fact, he did.

23:33.170 --> 23:34.899
Did he give a name?

23:34.940 --> 23:38.103
Actually, he's giving us
all the names.

23:38.150 --> 23:41.972
Everyone who ever committed
a crime for SBK.

23:42.020 --> 23:44.443
He didn't come here
to sell out one guy.

23:44.490 --> 23:47.084
He came here to sell out
hIS whole gang.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.113
GREGSON: He showed up
a couple hours ago

23:50.160 --> 23:52.128
and said he wanted immunity.

23:52.160 --> 23:53.593
Immunity from what?

23:53.630 --> 23:56.690
Everything. He's copping
to helping run SBK,

23:56.730 --> 23:58.869
poisoning his brother,
you name it.

23:58.900 --> 24:00.731
The Assistant DA.
in there is Nelson Lewis.

24:00.770 --> 24:02.897
He's gonna run for the top job
in a couple years.

24:02.940 --> 24:05.761
(chuckling):
He can't believe his luck.

24:05.810 --> 24:08.199
He told you
he was making the deal?

24:08.240 --> 24:09.639
He's got as much blood
on his hands

24:09.680 --> 24:11.477
as any criminal in this city.

24:11.510 --> 24:12.807
Mr. Lewis is willing
to forget that

24:12.850 --> 24:14.647
in order get himself elected,
is he?

24:14.680 --> 24:16.568
No. He's willing
to forget about that

24:16.620 --> 24:18.838
to keep an all-out war
from breaking out

24:18.890 --> 24:20.482
between SBK and Mara Tres.

24:20.520 --> 24:22.511
Wilcox is willing
to testify

24:22.560 --> 24:25.484
against every member of SBK
who ever followed his orders.

24:25.530 --> 24:27.998
That's got to be
150 collars, easy.

24:28.030 --> 24:29.998
There'll be no more gang war

24:30.030 --> 24:33.158
because there'll
be no more SBK.

24:33.200 --> 24:34.838
Did he say
who murdered Carmen Zelaya?

24:34.870 --> 24:36.929
Guy named Duane Pryor.

24:36.970 --> 24:39.962
He was one of the bangers
that was killed

24:40.010 --> 24:41.170
at the party the other night.

24:41.210 --> 24:42.700
According to Wilcox,

24:42.740 --> 24:44.947
Mara Tres killed his brother
back in '06,

24:44.980 --> 24:47.141
so he held a grudge.

24:47.180 --> 24:49.216
(phone ringing)

24:49.250 --> 24:52.242
Oh, sorry. I got to tell Paige
it's gonna be a late night.

24:52.290 --> 24:53.689
Hey.

24:55.190 --> 24:57.522
Duane Pryor was one
of Shinwell's friends.

24:57.560 --> 24:59.187
You knew him?

24:59.230 --> 25:00.288
No, but when Shinwell
started with the gang unit,

25:00.330 --> 25:01.854
I read up on him.

25:01.900 --> 25:03.868
His arms were covered
In tattoos.

25:03.900 --> 25:06.221
Well, that doesn't square with
what Carmen's roommate told you.

25:06.270 --> 25:08.898
That's because Duane Pryor
didn't kill Carmen.

25:08.940 --> 25:10.931
Tyus Wilcox did.

25:18.880 --> 25:20.245
You're kidding, right?

25:20.280 --> 25:23.886
Tyus Wilcox is serving
up SBK on a platter.

25:23.920 --> 25:26.639
He's going to help us
prevent a war.

25:26.690 --> 25:28.988
You want me to chuck al|_that
while you Investigate him

25:29.020 --> 25:30.214
for one murder?

25:30.260 --> 25:31.955
Would you be giving him immunity

25:31.990 --> 25:34.197
if there wasn't the possibility
of a gang war?

25:34.230 --> 25:35.629
That's a moot point.

25:35.660 --> 25:36.729
You wouldn't be.

25:36.760 --> 25:37.966
Fine. No, we wouldn't.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.991
But Mara Tres put ten people
in the morgue

25:40.030 --> 25:42.191
the other night,
that changes the equation.

25:42.240 --> 25:45.232
I think her point
is Mr. Wilcox knew it would.

25:45.270 --> 25:47.807
He killed
Halcon Zelaya's sister

25:47.840 --> 25:49.603
because he wanted
the guy to go nuclear.

25:49.640 --> 25:51.949
He was setting himself up
for the best deal he could get,

25:51.980 --> 25:53.914
and now, thanks to you,
he's getting it.

25:53.950 --> 25:55.315
Where do you get the idea

25:55.350 --> 25:57.910
that he personally killed
Carmen Zelaya?

25:57.950 --> 26:00.316
BELL: Carmen's roommate
saw her get abducted.

26:00.350 --> 26:02.682
She described a suspect
with no tattoos.

26:02.720 --> 26:05.689
Try finding someone else in SBK
who isn't inked up.

26:05.730 --> 26:06.981
WATSON: My partner spoke
to her a little while ago.

26:07.030 --> 26:09.726
He played a tape
of Tyus's voice.

26:09.760 --> 26:12.820
She said it sounded
just like the man she saw.

26:12.870 --> 26:15.031
An ear witness.
That's nothing.

26:15.070 --> 26:18.062
We're not saying we have him
dead to rights yet.

26:18.110 --> 26:20.066
But let us lean on him.

26:20.110 --> 26:22.704
No. I'm sorry, but no.

26:22.740 --> 26:26.073
There's no way I'm gonna let
you jeopardize a case this big.

26:26.110 --> 26:28.317
And for the record, Mr. Wilcox
already offered testimony

26:28.350 --> 26:29.715
regarding the murder

26:29.750 --> 26:31.081
of Ms. Zelaya.

26:31.120 --> 26:33.213
Duane Pryor did it.
Mr. Pryor is dead.

26:33.250 --> 26:35.184
If you want to close
Ms. Zelaya's murder?

26:35.220 --> 26:36.881
Consider it closed.

26:36.920 --> 26:39.081
I don't want it closed,
I want it solved.

26:39.130 --> 26:41.018
Well...

26:42.260 --> 26:45.024
I want a lot
more than that.

26:45.070 --> 26:47.026
Mr. Wilcox
is going to be deposed

26:47.070 --> 26:50.699
on dozens of SBK murders,
drug deals, bribery cases,

26:50.740 --> 26:52.105
you name it.

26:52.140 --> 26:53.869
I'm not gonna risk all that

26:53.910 --> 26:55.901
by letting you
talk to him again.

26:55.940 --> 26:57.646
That isn't up to you.

26:57.680 --> 26:59.807
If that's how
you want to play it, fine.

26:59.850 --> 27:02.910
Our bosses can get into it.

27:02.950 --> 27:04.986
But I'm telling you right now

27:05.020 --> 27:08.148
that the answer's
gonna be the same.

27:15.700 --> 27:17.099
(door closes)

27:17.130 --> 27:18.825
This isn't right.

27:18.870 --> 27:20.326
Try to look at the big picture.

27:20.370 --> 27:21.894
You helped expose
Tyus Wilcox.

27:21.940 --> 27:23.191
If you hadn't,

27:23.240 --> 27:26.835
he'd still be running SBK,
not burying it.

27:26.870 --> 27:28.735
After he testifies,

27:28.780 --> 27:30.975
he's gonna get shipped off
to the middle of nowhere.

27:31.010 --> 27:33.843
You don't think he has cash
stashed overseas somewhere?

27:33.880 --> 27:34.847
He's gonna ditch
his protection

27:34.880 --> 27:37.348
and go live on a beach.
He belongs in prison.

27:37.380 --> 27:40.315
I wish I controlled
who got immunity, but I don't.

27:40.350 --> 27:42.682
Listen, you've been
working hard.

27:42.720 --> 27:44.688
Go home, get some rest.

27:44.730 --> 27:45.856
I can't.

27:45.890 --> 27:48.097
I have somewhere I need to be.

27:50.730 --> 27:52.721
(quiet music playing)

28:00.040 --> 28:01.337
It's okay.

28:01.380 --> 28:03.075
You can take a seat.

28:03.110 --> 28:05.078
Somebody has to be first.

28:05.110 --> 28:06.975
Um, actually, I thought
I was running late.

28:07.010 --> 28:08.944
I'm supposed to
meet a friend.

28:08.980 --> 28:10.789
(phone ringing)

28:10.820 --> 28:12.344
Excuse me.

28:15.520 --> 28:17.112
Hello?

28:17.160 --> 28:18.752
TYUS: I know I'm probably
interrupting

28:18.790 --> 28:20.257
your friend's service,
but I figured

28:20.290 --> 28:21.996
it wouldn't be too crowded.

28:22.030 --> 28:24.123
Not many people turn out
for a dead rat.

28:24.170 --> 28:25.467
That's funny,
you calling someone a rat.

28:25.500 --> 28:27.388
And, you know,
there might be more people here

28:27.430 --> 28:29.864
if your whole gang
wasn't running for cover.

28:29.900 --> 28:31.162
SBK isn't my gang.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.768
It never was.

28:32.810 --> 28:35.131
Just a way to make money,
a lot of it.

28:35.180 --> 28:36.977
But that's over now.

28:37.010 --> 28:38.170
Time to turn a page.

28:38.210 --> 28:40.201
How'd you get my number?

28:40.250 --> 28:42.343
First time you came to see me,
you gave me your card, remember?

28:42.380 --> 28:44.245
Funny thing is,

28:44.290 --> 28:47.145
I knew who you were before
you even came through the door.

28:47.190 --> 28:51.957
Back in the day, Shinwell
was just another corner boy.

28:51.990 --> 28:55.221
Eager, handy with a gun, but
not exactly leadership material.

28:55.260 --> 28:57.228
Then he gets out of prison,
and all of a sudden,

28:57.260 --> 28:59.262
he's all ambitious.

28:59.300 --> 29:02.360
He moves up, starts getting
face time with top guys.

29:02.400 --> 29:05.198
Me and Bonzi, we wouldn't let
any of our people

29:05.240 --> 29:07.538
take their phones into meetings.

29:07.570 --> 29:10.368
Couldn't risk any
conversations getting recorded.

29:10.410 --> 29:12.241
They'd turn them over
at the door.

29:12.280 --> 29:14.214
And when somebody's new
and hot to move up,

29:14.250 --> 29:15.877
got to take a look, right?

29:15.920 --> 29:17.273
Had to wonder why he had
somebody named Doc

29:17.320 --> 29:18.981
on speed dial.

29:19.020 --> 29:20.442
(chuckling):
He wasn't sick.

29:20.490 --> 29:24.381
Then you turn out
to be a police consultant.

29:24.430 --> 29:27.285
I guess I just wanted you
to know.

29:27.330 --> 29:30.822
Everything that's happened
these last few days?

29:30.870 --> 29:32.292
It's because of you.

29:32.330 --> 29:34.093
You got this ball rolling.

29:34.140 --> 29:36.791
You're the reason Shinwell
Is In a cofﬁn.

29:36.840 --> 29:38.967
I'm also_ the reason
you're gomg to prIson.

29:39.010 --> 29:41.274
If you think you can take
your money and disappear,

29:41.310 --> 29:43.107
you can forget it.

29:43.140 --> 29:45.199
Whatever you say.

29:45.250 --> 29:46.444
Doc.

29:46.480 --> 29:48.471
(phone clicks)

29:53.960 --> 29:56.485
Yo-yo, toy soldier,
amethyst stone,

29:56.520 --> 29:58.522
glass eye, flip phone.

30:00.360 --> 30:03.158
Tortoise-shell comb.
Pliers with red handles.

30:14.640 --> 30:16.835
(frightened sobbing)

30:19.350 --> 30:21.272
My name is Carmen Zelaya.

30:21.320 --> 30:24.585
This message
is for my brother, Julio.

30:24.620 --> 30:26.315
(exhales)

30:26.350 --> 30:28.454
Didn't hear you come in.

30:28.490 --> 30:33.154
How did it go with
the assistant D.A.?

30:33.190 --> 30:34.999
Watson.

30:35.030 --> 30:37.225
Where were you this afternoon?

30:37.260 --> 30:38.261
Beg your pardon?

30:38.300 --> 30:41.337
It's a simple question.

30:41.370 --> 30:43.861
I went to visit Carmen
Zelaya's roommate.

30:43.910 --> 30:45.229
I'm not talking about that,

30:45.270 --> 30:49.138
I'm talking about
Shinwell's service.

30:49.180 --> 30:51.876
Where were you?

30:51.910 --> 30:54.310
I lost track of time.

30:54.350 --> 30:56.341
I'm sorry.

31:09.330 --> 31:11.264
Watson.

31:11.300 --> 31:12.995
No. Whatever excuse you have,
it isn't good enough.

31:13.030 --> 31:15.134
It hasn't been good enough
for weeks.

31:15.170 --> 31:16.296
Well, what's that
supposed to mean?
It means that I've needed you

31:16.340 --> 31:17.898
and you haven't been there.

31:17.940 --> 31:19.532
All right? I am sick of it,
and now Shinwell is dead.

31:19.570 --> 31:20.901
That's my fault, is it?

31:20.940 --> 31:22.077
Actually, according
to Tyus Wilcox,

31:22.110 --> 31:23.270
it is my fault.

31:23.310 --> 31:24.379
He called me this afternoon.

31:24.410 --> 31:26.173
He said that
he had Shinwell killed

31:26.210 --> 31:28.644
because he found my number
in his phone.

31:28.680 --> 31:30.318
Sorry about that.

31:30.350 --> 31:32.545
Are you?

31:32.590 --> 31:34.615
You said that you would
come with me.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.150
Immw.

31:36.190 --> 31:37.452
You forgot? You.

31:37.490 --> 31:39.253
Are you kidding me?
You can remember

31:39.290 --> 31:40.655
what you had for lunch
on your fifth birthday,

31:40.690 --> 31:42.590
you can remember
how many stars there were

31:42.630 --> 31:44.291
in the slq that night,
but you can't remember

31:44.330 --> 31:46.025
to come to a
memorIal serVIce

31:46.070 --> 31:47.219
for a friend that I cared about?

31:47.270 --> 31:49.329
You didn't go
because you didn't want to,

31:49.370 --> 31:50.962
because Shinwell hurt you, and
you just don't have it in you

31:51.010 --> 31:52.159
to get over
something like that.

31:52.210 --> 31:53.438
You know,
it's interesting to me.

31:53.470 --> 31:55.574
The true source of your anger
is Tyus Wilcox.

31:55.610 --> 31:57.009
Couldn't be more obvious.

31:57.040 --> 31:58.302
He's a cold-blooded killer,

31:58.350 --> 32:01.171
and he's gonna get away
with everything.

32:01.220 --> 32:02.414
Shinwell_was
also a kIller,

32:02.450 --> 32:04.315
and he was also gonna
get away with everything.

32:04.350 --> 32:06.580
Or did you forget he shot his
friend in the back 12 years ago?

32:06.620 --> 32:10.112
Look, he's dead.
I'm sorry.

32:10.160 --> 32:11.525
Tried to help him.

32:11.560 --> 32:13.380
But the only difference
between him and Tyus Wilcox

32:13.430 --> 32:16.228
is that he was an imbecile,

32:16.260 --> 32:18.262
and Tyus Wilcox
is not.

32:25.340 --> 32:28.036
Shinwell wrote this.

32:28.080 --> 32:30.275
It's a confession
to Jameel's murder.

32:30.310 --> 32:31.709
He wanted me to give
it to the police

32:31.750 --> 32:33.308
after SBK was brought down.

32:33.350 --> 32:35.443
He wasn't getting away
with anything.

32:35.480 --> 32:37.345
If you can't see
the difference

32:37.380 --> 32:42.408
between him and Tyus Wilcox...

32:53.470 --> 32:56.462
HALCON:
Ms. Watson, I presume?

32:56.500 --> 32:58.104
You and your partner got to quit

32:58.140 --> 33:00.005
using my priest
like an answering machine.

33:00.040 --> 33:03.476
Then maybe you should stop
using his church like an ATM.

33:03.510 --> 33:05.398
What do you want?

33:05.450 --> 33:07.338
I know who killed your sister.

33:09.720 --> 33:12.086
The person who killed Carmen
is serving as a witness

33:12.120 --> 33:13.314
in a high-profile case
for the city.

33:13.350 --> 33:15.784
He's in protective
custody, which means

33:15.820 --> 33:17.378
he travels in an armored car,

33:17.420 --> 33:19.229
he stays at a different
hotel every night

33:19.260 --> 33:20.454
and he has around-
the-clock security.

33:20.490 --> 33:22.026
So no matter how badly

33:22.060 --> 33:24.324
you want to get
to him, you can't.

33:24.370 --> 33:26.668
But I can.

33:26.700 --> 33:28.691
I can make him pay
for what he did.

33:28.740 --> 33:30.332
But I need your help.

33:30.370 --> 33:32.361
What kind of help?

33:33.610 --> 33:36.374
I need you to give me Carmen.

33:38.210 --> 33:40.747
I've been watching the
video you gave my partner.

33:40.780 --> 33:42.509
I think she is the
key to everything.

33:42.550 --> 33:44.541
IfI am right,

33:44.590 --> 33:47.047
it's time for you
to give her up.

33:47.090 --> 33:49.456
You say you know
who murdered her.

33:49.490 --> 33:53.051
Maybe I have my boys here
beat his name out of you,

33:53.090 --> 33:54.352
then we go and see
how protective

33:55.730 --> 33:57.425
Or maybe you're smart enough

33:57.460 --> 34:01.260
to wait until he has
no protectIon at all.

34:01.300 --> 34:03.439
If you help me,
he goes to prison.

34:03.470 --> 34:07.566
No armored cars, no rotating
hotel rooms, no security detail.

34:07.610 --> 34:11.398
He's just another convict.

34:11.450 --> 34:14.214
I'm guessing you know plenty
of people behind bars

34:14.250 --> 34:18.186
who you could send to
introduce themselves.

34:20.550 --> 34:22.450
And you don't have
a problem with that.

34:22.490 --> 34:25.186
Not tonight, I don't.

34:29.530 --> 34:31.521
(phone ringing)

34:36.400 --> 34:38.504
Hello?

34:38.540 --> 34:41.600
WOMAN: Sorry, I know you
don't want to hear from me.

34:41.640 --> 34:44.473
but, um, this won't take long.

34:44.510 --> 34:46.444
Actually, I could, um...

34:46.480 --> 34:50.246
I could do with someone
to talk to.

34:50.280 --> 34:52.680
Oh, Sherlock.

34:52.720 --> 34:55.518
I'm afraid that time has passed.

34:55.560 --> 34:57.482
What do you mean?

34:57.520 --> 35:00.648
I mean, it's time for me to go.

35:00.690 --> 35:04.524
I just wanted to say good-bye.

35:04.570 --> 35:07.619
Please, if you want me
to say it, I'll say it, okay?

35:09.800 --> 35:11.802
The text that Detective Perkins
received the other day,

35:11.840 --> 35:13.831
that I claimed came
from someone else, I sent it.

35:15.340 --> 35:20.539
I sent it, and then... forgot.

35:20.580 --> 35:23.777
Sherlock, my love.

35:23.820 --> 35:26.448
I'm sorry.

35:26.490 --> 35:28.515
But it's too late for that now.

35:30.520 --> 35:34.524
Everything that's coming,

35:34.560 --> 35:36.721
you're gonna have
to deal with it on your own.

35:36.760 --> 35:37.795
(crackling)

35:37.830 --> 35:39.422
What was that noise?

35:39.470 --> 35:40.619
Where, where are you?

35:40.670 --> 35:43.298
It's all right, Sherlock.

35:43.340 --> 35:45.331
Tell me where you are.

35:45.370 --> 35:48.669
I'm close, Sherlock.

35:48.710 --> 35:52.373
I'm always close.

36:00.650 --> 36:02.515
(panﬁng)

36:22.340 --> 36:23.705
GREGSON:
Mr. Wilcox,

36:23.740 --> 36:25.901
Mr. Richards,
have a seat, both of you.

36:27.580 --> 36:29.912
Uh, Captain,
I'm a little confused.

36:29.950 --> 36:31.588
The D.A.'s office
told me

36:31.620 --> 36:33.747
they already got
what they needed.

36:33.790 --> 36:37.317
My client's been deposed for
20 hours over the last two days.

36:37.360 --> 36:39.783
Frankly, we could both
use a rest.

36:39.830 --> 36:42.651
Well, I hate to wear you out,
but there's something

36:42.700 --> 36:46.466
you need to see.

36:46.500 --> 36:49.697
(crying):
My name Is Carmen Zelaya.

36:49.740 --> 36:51.731
What is this?

36:51.770 --> 36:55.433
WATSON: Those are the last few
moments of Carmen Zelaya's life.

36:55.480 --> 36:58.301
That video was given
to her brother, Halcon Zelaya,

36:58.350 --> 37:00.568
the man who runs Mara Tres.
It's the reason ten people

37:00.610 --> 37:03.773
were killed at an SBK
party a few nights ago.

37:03.820 --> 37:05.378
BELL: Your client's
been granted immunity

37:05.420 --> 37:07.388
for an awful lot, Mr. Richards.

37:07.420 --> 37:09.559
But he doesn't have immunity
for killing her.

37:09.590 --> 37:10.818
Excuse me?

37:10.860 --> 37:13.522
Uh, I don't know
what kind of ambush

37:13.560 --> 37:14.959
you think you're pulling...
WATSON:
QUIet.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.649
You're gonna miss
the most important part.

37:16.700 --> 37:19.260
You see that jump?

37:19.300 --> 37:20.722
The tape stops, and
then runs again.

37:20.770 --> 37:22.533
RICHARDS:
Yeah?

37:22.570 --> 37:24.709
So after the jump,
there's blood on her lip.

37:24.740 --> 37:26.560
The first time I saw it,
I thought the person

37:26.610 --> 37:28.805
who was making the tape
stopped recording to hit her,

37:28.840 --> 37:30.728
to make her say
what they wanted.

37:30.780 --> 37:32.748
But it's strange.
The tape keeps running,

37:32.780 --> 37:34.577
but her lip never swells.

37:34.620 --> 37:37.646
There's no redness or_abrasion
near her mouth, eIther.

37:37.680 --> 37:39.545
So it made me wonder:

37:39.590 --> 37:42.582
could there be another
explanatIon for that blood?

37:42.620 --> 37:44.588
I couldn't know for sure,

37:44.630 --> 37:47.588
until an anonymous tip
led the police to the location

37:47.630 --> 37:49.359
of her body last night.

37:49.400 --> 37:50.856
GREGSON: The M.E.
found exactly

37:50.900 --> 37:53.721
what Ms. Watson
thought he would.

37:53.770 --> 37:54.930
Carmen's lip was fine.

37:54.970 --> 37:57.564
There was no cuts,
punctures or bruises.

37:57.600 --> 37:59.761
The blood in the video
wasn't hers.

37:59.810 --> 38:01.573
It was the killer's.

38:01.610 --> 38:03.737
You can see

38:03.780 --> 38:06.340
the restraints on her
wrists are different.

38:06.380 --> 38:07.642
The guy who was
holding her hostage

38:07.680 --> 38:09.079
had to tie her back up

38:09.120 --> 38:11.486
because she wriggled free
and bit him.

38:11.520 --> 38:13.738
WATSON: She was a fighter,
wasn't she, Tyus?

38:13.790 --> 38:15.678
BELL: The M.E. wasn't able
to recover any DNA

38:15.720 --> 38:17.756
from Carmen's mouth--
you did a pretty good job

38:17.790 --> 38:18.950
pouring bleach in there.

38:18.990 --> 38:21.356
But only pretty good.

38:21.400 --> 38:22.992
There was still some
in her throat.

38:23.030 --> 38:25.328
WATSON: Could there be
another explanation

38:25.370 --> 38:27.668
for your blood in her esophagus?

38:27.700 --> 38:28.997
Or maybe you'd like
to prove to us

38:29.040 --> 38:31.099
that you don't have
any bite marks anywhere.

38:31.140 --> 38:33.335
RICHARDS:
You are gettIng

38:33.370 --> 38:35.099
way ahead of yourselves.

38:35.140 --> 38:37.802
If you tested his DNA
without a warrant,

38:37.840 --> 38:39.398
that is an unlawful search.

38:39.450 --> 38:41.668
You didn't have permission...

38:41.720 --> 38:42.869
We did, actually.

38:42.920 --> 38:44.649
As part of your immunity deal,

38:44.690 --> 38:47.716
you were required
to provide a DNA sample.

38:47.750 --> 38:48.956
The DA. wanted
to check it

38:48.990 --> 38:52.585
against all old,
unsolved SBK murders.

38:52.630 --> 38:53.688
BELL: Your client
has admitted

38:53.730 --> 38:54.992
that he suggested
certain crimes,

38:55.030 --> 38:58.818
but he claimed he never
carrIed out any hImself.

38:58.870 --> 39:01.498
That was probably true,
until this week.

39:01.540 --> 39:02.893
I'm still covered.

39:02.940 --> 39:05.636
You said I have immunity
for everything.

39:05.670 --> 39:07.809
I have immunity.

39:07.840 --> 39:09.728
You had immunity.

39:09.780 --> 39:12.101
The other day,
you told a New York D.A.,

39:12.150 --> 39:14.675
under oath,
that Duane Pryor killed Carmen.

39:14.720 --> 39:15.971
That was a lie.

39:16.020 --> 39:18.784
GREGSON: You perjured
yourself, Mr. Wilcox.

39:18.820 --> 39:21.414
That voids your deal with
the State of New York.

39:21.460 --> 39:24.156
We can use the testimony
you've already provided

39:24.190 --> 39:25.782
to roll up your gang.

39:25.830 --> 39:29.618
And now, we can send you
to prison with them.

39:31.130 --> 39:33.894
and Halcon's friends
on the inside,

39:33.930 --> 39:36.091
maybe you'll get luclq
and spend the rest of your life

39:36.140 --> 39:38.506
in solitary confinement.

39:48.820 --> 39:51.448
WOMAN:
Sherlock?

39:51.490 --> 39:53.879
May I sit with you?

39:59.560 --> 40:02.028
*

40:02.060 --> 40:04.028
I'm very glad you're here.

40:04.060 --> 40:06.824
*

40:06.870 --> 40:09.134
I'm, um, sorry
about last night.

40:09.170 --> 40:12.662
Are you?

40:12.710 --> 40:15.474
(sighs)

40:15.510 --> 40:17.808
The little tests you devised,

40:17.840 --> 40:20.843
the ones you thought
would help your memory,

40:20.880 --> 40:24.145
wrapping boxes and trying to
remember what was in them,

40:24.180 --> 40:28.139
they weren't enough, Sherlock.

40:28.190 --> 40:31.159
You're not well.

40:31.190 --> 40:35.650
And I would've done anything to
get you to do the right thing.

40:35.700 --> 40:37.156
You understand that, don't you?

40:37.200 --> 40:40.169
Yeah, well, you didn't
do anything, it was me.

40:40.200 --> 40:42.191
*

40:50.780 --> 40:53.169
Why do you look like my mother?

40:53.210 --> 40:56.976
I'm the part of you
that wants to get better.

40:57.020 --> 41:00.547
Who else would I look like?

41:01.860 --> 41:04.579
I'm a bit scared.

41:06.890 --> 41:08.994
Would you like to hold my hand?

41:09.030 --> 41:11.089
*

41:15.100 --> 41:16.863
Mr. Holmes?

41:18.270 --> 41:20.158
I'm ready for you now.

41:20.210 --> 41:22.633
*

41:49.940 --> 41:52.932
*

42:01.980 --> 42:03.948
