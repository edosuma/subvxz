01:04.731 --> 01:06.566


01:24.084 --> 01:25.085
Paula.

01:26.628 --> 01:27.629
Paula!

01:32.884 --> 01:34.344
We made it!

01:34.844 --> 01:35.929
Huh?

01:39.474 --> 01:42.727
I thought you were mad at me, maybe hurt.

01:47.023 --> 01:48.525
What is this place?

01:50.402 --> 01:52.028
Everything's fine here.

01:53.738 --> 01:55.198
You see?

01:58.451 --> 01:59.452
It's my…

02:01.621 --> 02:03.123
It's our world.

02:04.666 --> 02:05.667
Yeah.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.879
This is our world, Paula.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.425
Our perfect world.

02:30.442 --> 02:33.278
Pablo! Let me take care of this.

02:34.070 --> 02:36.531
Oh, you'll take care of it?
And who are you?

02:36.614 --> 02:38.700
I'm Seixas,
the director here at the clinic.

02:39.576 --> 02:43.121
- Oh, yeah? So where is everybody, Seixas?
- They're all locked inside.

02:43.204 --> 02:45.457
It's our standard procedure
in a situation like this.

02:46.041 --> 02:48.335
I need to see a patient, Paula Costa.
Where is she?

02:48.418 --> 02:51.004
That won't be possible.
You'll have to come back tomorrow.

02:51.087 --> 02:52.213
It has to be today.

02:52.297 --> 02:55.842
It's not possible. She's sedated.
She's sleeping. She's locked inside.

02:58.136 --> 02:59.804
- This is an order.

02:59.888 --> 03:02.640
Oh, is it? An order from whom?
From the judge?

03:02.724 --> 03:04.392
Listen, haven't you figured out by now

03:04.476 --> 03:07.979
that this is a judicial asylum and that
in here, you have no authority?

03:08.563 --> 03:10.607
You do your job and I'll do mine, okay?

03:43.181 --> 03:45.850
We only found one of them.
The girl vanished.

03:57.696 --> 03:59.823
NATIONAL PRISON DATABASE
N 176662 RAFAEL G MELLO

03:59.906 --> 04:04.619
<i>"Rafael Gustavo Mello,</i>
<i>35 years of age, Brazilian, divorced"…</i>

04:05.412 --> 04:08.373
And a vast experience
sitting in that chair, from what I see.

04:11.668 --> 04:17.048
"Possession of narcotics,
grand theft auto, disturbing the peace"…

04:17.132 --> 04:18.550
A little bit of everything.

04:19.634 --> 04:21.761
You sure are lucky to get out of prison

04:21.845 --> 04:24.764
just as fast as you manage
to go back inside.

04:24.848 --> 04:27.267
It's good to be a politician's son,
isn't it?

04:28.143 --> 04:30.061
You injured two people.

04:30.145 --> 04:34.274
We've got you for breaking and entering,
and to top it all off,

04:34.357 --> 04:36.443
there's a dead body on the stairs.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.195
You're fucked, Rafael.

04:39.779 --> 04:42.824
This time around, it won't be so easy
for Daddy to get you out.

04:43.616 --> 04:46.161
Where's your accomplice? Huh?

04:47.162 --> 04:50.040
Tell me where he is, and we can help you.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.636
- Is he stable?
- Yes, sir.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.892
Leave me alone with him.

05:18.860 --> 05:24.199
Did you know
Dante created a circle of hell

05:25.742 --> 05:29.245
just to punish
the worst type of human scum?

05:30.747 --> 05:32.832
The ninth circle of hell.

05:34.709 --> 05:39.089
The one made for traitors like you.

05:40.924 --> 05:43.051
Believe me,

05:44.886 --> 05:47.639
I never doubted for a second
that you weren't a traitor.

05:50.475 --> 05:54.938
Our greatest weakness lies
in our greatest strength.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.776
Yours, it turns out, was your imagination…

06:01.986 --> 06:04.364
the only thing I want from you.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.654
You're still here?

06:46.865 --> 06:48.366
Penny for your thoughts.

06:50.076 --> 06:53.621
I'm thinking this place
might not be our world.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.875
But if this isn't our world…

06:59.919 --> 07:01.421
what is this place?

07:02.589 --> 07:05.008
The ninth circle of hell.

08:54.909 --> 08:58.538
The body of the deceased,
identified as Maximiliano Marques Ribeiro,

08:58.621 --> 09:01.458
displays unmistakable signs
of fabric burns.

09:09.799 --> 09:13.386
A ligature mark can be clearly seen
above the larynx.

09:14.262 --> 09:18.683
Cause of death: suicide by asphyxiation.

09:30.528 --> 09:32.030
Damn it, Marques.

09:51.508 --> 09:53.134
- Today is the day.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.525
- Today is the day.

10:11.986 --> 10:13.738
Today is the day.

10:25.417 --> 10:27.377
Today is the day.

10:28.003 --> 10:30.005
- Stop calling me.
- Today is the day.

10:31.006 --> 10:33.341
- Stop calling me. Stop calling me!
- Today is the day.

10:37.262 --> 10:40.348
- Today is the day.
- Get out!

12:00.679 --> 12:04.099
Get out. Get out, get out, get out.
Get out.

12:09.813 --> 12:12.399
Drink this water, Paula.
It'll be good for you.

12:15.151 --> 12:17.779
Drink some water, Paula.
It's a beautiful day.

12:30.041 --> 12:32.627
Mom. Mom.

12:34.546 --> 12:35.880
Honey.

12:40.719 --> 12:42.762
Mom, help me.

12:43.638 --> 12:45.015
Honey.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.725
Help me, Mom.

12:51.646 --> 12:52.731
Mom, help me.

13:21.843 --> 13:24.554
Hi, Mr. Antônio. How are you?

13:26.431 --> 13:29.934
I am, but don't worry.

13:30.018 --> 13:32.437
They won't be able
to keep me here very long.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.526
I just wanted to tell you something, Dad.

13:39.569 --> 13:42.364
As soon as I get out of here,
I'm going to kill you.

13:43.698 --> 13:45.325
Give my regards to my mom.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.499
You can take me now.

14:51.349 --> 14:53.143
What did they do to you?

14:59.149 --> 15:01.151
NO TRESPASSING
PRIVATE PROPERTY

15:35.226 --> 15:36.353
Honey.

15:37.062 --> 15:40.357
Honey! Let's go, honey!
Let's go home, honey. It's over!

15:40.440 --> 15:44.319
Come on. Come on! Shh. Honey.
Come with me.

15:44.402 --> 15:46.154
She doesn't remember you.

15:49.032 --> 15:51.076
She's in her own perfect world.

15:52.077 --> 15:53.953
Get out of here.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.668
It was all an act, Paula.

15:59.751 --> 16:03.004
Schultz orchestrated everything
to manipulate you.

17:03.857 --> 17:06.026
What are you doing, Camila? Are you crazy?

17:07.110 --> 17:09.779
The last person to investigate
this fucking mess was murdered.

17:09.863 --> 17:11.281
We have to be careful, Chico.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.117
What? Wasn't it a suicide?

17:16.244 --> 17:18.913
That's what the report says,
but it's not what happened.

17:18.997 --> 17:20.498
Damn, Camila.

17:20.582 --> 17:23.043
From now on,
we can't breathe a word of this to anyone.

17:23.126 --> 17:24.627
We're in too deep.

17:25.337 --> 17:28.715
Well, here's the tox report
you asked me for.

17:34.596 --> 17:35.930
That's impossible.

17:36.014 --> 17:37.015
What?

17:44.606 --> 17:46.524
You're scaring me.

17:46.608 --> 17:49.611
I need the case reports involving
this clinic that we have access to.

17:49.694 --> 17:51.029
- Which ones?
- All of them.

17:51.112 --> 17:53.782
- From its founding to the present day.
- Wait.

17:53.865 --> 17:57.285
The database only keeps information from
the last five years. We can't do that.

17:57.369 --> 17:59.996
The database, maybe,
but we keep everything archived.

18:00.830 --> 18:02.332
Or at least we should.

18:04.501 --> 18:07.545
Okay. I'll do it.

18:08.213 --> 18:09.214
Chico.

18:11.007 --> 18:12.509
Take care of yourself.

20:03.536 --> 20:04.996
Welcome, Paula.

20:09.042 --> 20:10.835
We've been waiting for you.

21:00.468 --> 21:01.469
Wait.

21:11.646 --> 21:13.481
You did very well.

21:15.734 --> 21:17.902
We're almost done.

21:18.611 --> 21:21.948
Soon you can finally rest.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.871
I've studied people like you
my whole life.

21:29.539 --> 21:32.250
That's why I knew you'd come back.

21:36.421 --> 21:39.799
We didn't even
have to look for you outside.

21:40.550 --> 21:45.388
As long as you were alive,
I knew you'd have that impulse

21:45.472 --> 21:48.808
that controls the electricity
in your cerebellum.

21:50.477 --> 21:54.230
Do you know what impulse
I'm talking about?

21:54.314 --> 21:59.319
A manifestation that, in your case,
is more powerful than anything else.

22:01.946 --> 22:03.656
Revenge.

22:07.827 --> 22:11.456
Whoever said
love is the most powerful emotion

22:12.290 --> 22:14.542
certainly didn't know you.

22:20.465 --> 22:21.591
Thank you

22:23.385 --> 22:25.512
for coming right back into my hands,

22:27.389 --> 22:28.473
Paula.

22:42.320 --> 22:46.908
I'll admit
I've always considered happiness

22:48.326 --> 22:51.371
to be just a teenage fantasy.

22:52.038 --> 22:54.749
From a very stupid teenager, I might add.

22:54.833 --> 22:58.837
But happiness is
the only word I can think of

22:58.920 --> 23:01.047
to explain what I'm feeling right now.

23:31.828 --> 23:34.456
I'm sorry,
but I couldn't say this over the phone.

23:34.539 --> 23:36.041
Close the door. Close it.

23:40.837 --> 23:43.256
Hey, how long has it been
since you've slept?

23:43.882 --> 23:45.050
I need your help.

23:49.429 --> 23:51.139
- Coffee?
- Nah.

23:51.222 --> 23:53.850
Look at this. These reports are recent.

23:53.933 --> 23:57.896
Paula Costa, Lúcia Costa, Marques Ribeiro.
Same pattern.

23:57.979 --> 23:59.272
The same drug.

23:59.356 --> 24:03.860
Now, these here, from 2000, 2005, 2010,
these were in the pile you brought me.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.403
I chose some at random.

24:05.487 --> 24:08.573
There are at least 30 cases here where
the same drug is found in the bloodstream.

24:08.656 --> 24:11.743
Some were at insignificant levels
that didn't raise any red flags.

24:20.001 --> 24:21.002
Fuck.

24:21.795 --> 24:23.213
Do you know what it is?

24:23.797 --> 24:25.507
It was an experimental drug.

24:25.590 --> 24:27.258
It was banned by the FDA

24:27.342 --> 24:31.137
because the effects were controversial,
shall we say.

24:31.721 --> 24:33.765
- What effects?
- Let me see.

24:33.848 --> 24:37.102
It removes your free will.
Like, it plays tricks with your desires.

24:37.185 --> 24:39.354
It makes the person totally passive.

24:39.437 --> 24:42.565
The person becomes
almost like a human carcass, empty.

24:42.649 --> 24:45.068
Does it cause hallucinations
or memory loss?

24:45.151 --> 24:46.361
Depending on the dose, yes.

24:47.112 --> 24:49.155
But I've never seen anything
beyond some theories.

24:49.239 --> 24:52.492
It was tested in Europe in the early '60s,

24:52.575 --> 24:57.580
first as a sort of antidepressant,
but results were tragic.

24:58.206 --> 25:00.166
It's almost like an urban legend, really.

25:00.250 --> 25:03.795
It kind of makes me want to try it to see
what all the fuss is about.

25:03.878 --> 25:06.464
What if I wanted
to stop this drug's effects?

25:06.548 --> 25:08.591
Hmm. Like an antidote?

25:09.259 --> 25:10.260
Sort of.

25:10.844 --> 25:14.848
Hmm. I'll have to do some research.

25:16.099 --> 25:17.600
Maybe it doesn't exist.

25:18.852 --> 25:23.982
But if it does,
I'll find a way to bring it to you.

25:47.422 --> 25:50.133
Forty years spent waiting for this moment.

25:59.851 --> 26:02.312
Forty years of hard work.

26:03.938 --> 26:04.981
Research.

26:05.565 --> 26:09.652
Trial and error. But it's finally here.

26:18.203 --> 26:21.581
I suppose
this is what happiness feels like.

26:33.259 --> 26:35.220
Do you know what we're going to do now?

26:38.515 --> 26:41.685
We'll evolve a thousand years
in just a few hours.

26:41.768 --> 26:42.769
Clear!

26:45.230 --> 26:46.481
Clear!

27:11.923 --> 27:14.050
The Model…

27:14.634 --> 27:20.181
shows no rejection of the implant.

27:20.473 --> 27:22.642
Quite the opposite.

27:25.103 --> 27:29.941
It all played out exactly as we predicted.

27:30.859 --> 27:34.738
The process is complete.

27:40.285 --> 27:42.454
Aren't you happy?

27:43.079 --> 27:45.290

<i>I loved that rug.</i>

27:49.419 --> 27:51.588
I'll buy you a new one.

27:53.381 --> 27:55.550
Let's make a toast!

27:56.509 --> 28:00.555
<i>And how am I supposed</i>
<i>to drink this champagne?</i>

28:00.805 --> 28:02.474
<i>Intravenously?</i>

28:02.557 --> 28:04.017


28:04.726 --> 28:07.312
It's just symbolic.

28:08.271 --> 28:10.607
We're celebrating!

28:10.690 --> 28:13.318
<i>Did you notify the investors?</i>

28:14.152 --> 28:17.364
Our colleagues from Stuttgart
are aware of the situation.

28:17.447 --> 28:22.952
Next week, we'll receive
a visit from Dr. Boremann

28:23.036 --> 28:24.662
and Dr. Fritzche.

28:25.205 --> 28:27.123
<i>Patient zero.</i>

28:28.667 --> 28:30.543
That's it!

28:31.544 --> 28:34.798
The Model is ready to be implemented.

28:36.508 --> 28:41.554
We'll start the last phase
in just a few months.

28:44.015 --> 28:49.437
It won't be easy to find a host.

28:52.399 --> 28:55.193
But maybe we'll find one.

28:58.697 --> 29:08.289
We've still got a long process
of trial and error ahead of us.

29:09.040 --> 29:12.669
<i>I have to admit, you did it.</i>

29:16.089 --> 29:18.049
Thanks, Dad.

29:24.389 --> 29:27.183
To this new victory!

29:34.941 --> 29:37.402
- <i>Cheers!</i>
- Cheers!

29:40.071 --> 29:44.200
3 MONTHS LATER

30:12.103 --> 30:14.939
I brought you this. I know you like them.

30:56.898 --> 30:58.066
Hi, miss.

31:02.737 --> 31:04.572
I'm Martina. Do you remember me?

31:13.373 --> 31:14.749
Are you feeling better?

31:26.594 --> 31:27.721
Thanks.

31:31.850 --> 31:33.852
- Paula, give it back.
- That's all right.

31:33.935 --> 31:35.437
She can keep it, okay?

31:36.271 --> 31:37.272
Bye.

31:41.484 --> 31:44.237
Ready to go inside? You need to rest.

32:14.017 --> 32:16.227
- Paula, wake up.
- Mmm.

32:16.978 --> 32:18.146
I'll help you sit.

32:22.192 --> 32:26.154
You've got a visitor.
Don't worry. Dr. Schultz authorized it.

32:27.864 --> 32:29.366
You're going to be just fine.

32:51.805 --> 32:53.890
Can you give me a minute with her, please?

33:03.400 --> 33:06.027
You have no idea how badly
I wanted to see you again.

33:11.491 --> 33:12.492
Paula…

33:14.619 --> 33:16.121
do you know who I am?

33:18.456 --> 33:19.958
I'm your friend.

33:32.721 --> 33:34.514
