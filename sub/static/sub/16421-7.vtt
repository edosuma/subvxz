00:04.212 --> 00:06.089
[Freddy] Hey, Zack. Aren't you eating?

00:06.172 --> 00:07.257
Nah, I'm good.

00:07.465 --> 00:09.467
Are you crazy? It's spaghetti day.

00:09.759 --> 00:11.094
I've got something better.

00:11.219 --> 00:12.679
-[others gasp]
-[trays clattering]

00:14.222 --> 00:17.809
What do you have against spaghetti--
and keeping all your teeth?

00:18.601 --> 00:20.061
Why waste your time chewing,

00:20.145 --> 00:22.188
when you can just suck your lunch
through a straw?

00:22.731 --> 00:27.610
I consider myself a man of culture,
but that looks like doody.

00:28.778 --> 00:32.198
Well, the real question is--
does it taste like doody?

00:32.449 --> 00:34.617
Honestly, I'm not that curious.

00:36.786 --> 00:39.914
Mmmmm! Hamburger and fries.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.542
A hamburger milkshake?

00:42.792 --> 00:45.170
It's a mealshake-patent-pending.

00:45.253 --> 00:46.838
I put a hamburger and French fries

00:46.921 --> 00:49.841
in the blender and voilà,
a delicious meal.

00:49.966 --> 00:53.303
Why would anyone do that
to an innocent hamburger?

00:53.887 --> 00:55.597
I had to do something.

00:55.680 --> 00:58.558
My dumb brother sold
his forum exercise "machine"

00:58.641 --> 01:00.602
to a workout company for a bunch of money.

01:00.935 --> 01:02.270
It's just tennis balls.

01:02.812 --> 01:05.023
Ooh, does he have a tennis ball for abs?

01:05.565 --> 01:07.108
No, don't you get it?

01:07.400 --> 01:10.195
I've always been the smart Kwan
and he's the dumb Kwan.

01:10.278 --> 01:12.030
But now that he's got this business,

01:12.197 --> 01:15.033
he's the smart Kwan--
which makes me the dumb Kwan.

01:16.076 --> 01:19.162
So, putting a hamburger
in a blender makes you the smart Kwan?

01:19.704 --> 01:21.372
Just taste it.

01:21.873 --> 01:23.792
[Tomika sighs]

01:26.711 --> 01:31.883
Whoa! That's amazing!
Do I taste ketchup and mustard?

01:32.008 --> 01:33.760
Give it a second
and you'll taste the relish.

01:33.968 --> 01:37.305
I don't taste any--
[dreamily] There it is.

01:37.806 --> 01:41.267
You've got pizza, fried chicken,
and Thanksgiving dinner.

01:42.352 --> 01:46.689
Whoa, I can taste the pepperoni.
I've been eating everything wrong.

01:47.148 --> 01:48.650
That's crazy good.

01:48.983 --> 01:50.485
Is that cranberry stuffing?

01:50.568 --> 01:55.156
It's like Thanksgiving at my grandma's--
without all the cats and screaming.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.909
Lawrence? No way.

01:58.159 --> 01:59.786
I don't roll the dice when it comes
to food.

01:59.869 --> 02:02.831
I'll stick with good, old,
reliable cafeteria spaghetti.

02:02.914 --> 02:05.583
Ahhhhh! A rat!

02:05.667 --> 02:09.879
There's a...a gross,
nasty rat swimming in the spaghetti sauce!

02:10.004 --> 02:11.714
-[spaghetti spurts]
-[Lawrence] Oh!

02:15.635 --> 02:18.555
Sorry, Summer. Here's some napkins.

02:19.681 --> 02:21.307
Ugh! Ew! [shuddering]

02:21.432 --> 02:24.853
Doris, I'm quite sure there isn't a rat
in my school.

02:25.311 --> 02:26.563
What's all the commotion?

02:26.729 --> 02:29.524
There's a rat in the spaghetti. [winces]

02:29.774 --> 02:33.361
Good thing I ate the teachers' spaghetti
and not the kids' spaghetti.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.155
It's from the same pot.

02:35.530 --> 02:38.491
[spaghetti spurts]

02:38.658 --> 02:40.660
Mr. Finn!

02:40.994 --> 02:44.205
It's okay. It's teachers' spaghetti.

02:45.665 --> 02:47.041
Uh, ridiculous.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.669
During my tenure,
Travis Prep has never gotten less than

02:49.752 --> 02:51.546
an "A" rating from the health inspector.

02:52.672 --> 02:54.674
Mr. Finn, wipe your face and come with me.

02:57.051 --> 02:58.845
At least I've still got my trusty pudding.

03:00.597 --> 03:01.598
There is a rat!

03:01.973 --> 03:03.516
-Now he's in the pudding!
-[Doris] Ugh!

Hello, children.

The health department has closed
the cafeteria

04:10.291 --> 04:13.044
until our rodent issue has been resolved.

Thank you for volunteering
to help me track it down.

04:22.345 --> 04:23.471
What?

04:24.138 --> 04:28.685
All the other teachers were afraid
of being bitten by a disease-ridden rat.

thinking about bringing in a food truck,

to be the smart Kwan again.

Vermin Lung.

from gym today.

I told you I'd arrive
when you least expect it.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.306
You never said that.

07:53.389 --> 07:56.559
Well, yeah, 'cause if I did,
you would have expected it.

is 10 percent off.

your food more than ours.

But corndogs are already on a stick.

11:36.904 --> 11:40.699
Yes, but on another stick--two sticks.
I didn't have to touch the first stick.

11:40.783 --> 11:41.784
Don't you see?

11:42.952 --> 11:45.413
Yeah, but we promised not
to eat that delicious stick food

11:45.496 --> 11:46.747
for the good of Zack's truck.

11:46.956 --> 11:48.958
We're no good to Zack's truck like this.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.752
Right. I mean,
if we ate a little stick food,

11:51.836 --> 11:52.837
we'd do our jobs better.

11:53.003 --> 11:55.881
Really, we'd be breaking our promise
to Zack for Zack.

11:55.965 --> 11:58.467
Exactly! We're such good friends.

12:01.011 --> 12:02.555
Where are you going?

12:03.389 --> 12:04.932
Listen, Summer,
we know what you're gonna say.

12:05.015 --> 12:06.892
I can't stop thinking about stick food.

12:07.268 --> 12:10.396
I just need a taste. I know--I am so weak.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.441
You really are. I'm shocked.

12:15.109 --> 12:18.737
Well, we'll go with you,
make sure no one sees you... being weak.

12:21.073 --> 12:26.620
Come on, guys, no line over here.
Come get your delicious meals in a cup.

a "Vote for Stick It

Guys? Guys?

12:56.233 --> 12:58.986
Guys! What the heck?

12:59.320 --> 13:02.281
There is a very simple explanation
for this, Zack--

13:02.823 --> 13:05.409
and Summer's gonna tell you
what it is right now.

13:05.618 --> 13:10.664
Uh...uh...uh... you're dreaming.
Shhhh! Go back to sleep.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.625
It's not a dream.

13:12.708 --> 13:15.419
It's a nightmare where two
of my friends betray me.

13:44.907 --> 13:49.453
I asked you one simple thing--
don't eat from our nemesis' food truck.

13:49.703 --> 13:52.831
Oh,
don't eat from our nemesis' food truck.

13:53.082 --> 13:54.542

13:54.875 --> 13:57.545
But you did, so, I'm gonna win this vote

13:57.628 --> 14:00.339
and prove that I'm not the dumb Kwan,
all on my own.

I had to fire my blenderistas.

Hey, do you have any free samples?

14:21.485 --> 14:24.071
I'm getting pretty hungry waiting in line
for the good truck.

I'll give you our two top-sellers,

14:53.976 --> 14:56.395
Is this the pizza or the tacos?

14:56.812 --> 14:58.606
I'm pretty sure they're both in there.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.444
Okay, gang, we're gonna figure out

15:03.527 --> 15:07.031
the volume of this bowling ball,
using the displacement method.

at the truck.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.133

-I'm just fine. Why do you ask?
-[pants squishing]

15:31.055 --> 15:33.307
Zack, buddy, take a minute. Clean up.

15:33.432 --> 15:36.769
Why? Does it look like something horrible
happened to me because the people

15:36.852 --> 15:39.021
I thought were my friends betrayed me?

15:39.855 --> 15:41.106
Something like that, yes.

from the airport this morning.

[typing] "On my way."

16:06.090 --> 16:08.384

16:18.477 --> 16:20.187
It only there was a way we could make it
up to him.

16:20.521 --> 16:23.065
I'm pretty sure Carl's not gonna
forgive me.

16:23.774 --> 16:25.359
-No, Zack.
-Mmm.

16:25.526 --> 16:28.112
When he loses that vote,
he'll be the dumb Kwan again.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.031
Because of his dumb friends.
He'll never forgive us.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.825
Maybe we could help him win the vote.

16:33.033 --> 16:35.202
How? It's tomorrow. It's too late.

16:35.327 --> 16:36.370
Ah, it's never too late.

16:36.704 --> 16:40.541
In my official capacity as your teacher,
I can't actively promote voter fraud,

16:40.749 --> 16:41.959

16:42.042 --> 16:45.629
some "unofficial" tips
on stuffing ballot boxes.

Zack's truck better,

to tell you--

You don't have to talk. Just look.

17:19.246 --> 17:22.499
Oh, great, the vote's today,

17:22.583 --> 17:24.918
and now there's another truck
in my parking spot.

17:25.419 --> 17:26.503
[Freddy] That's your truck.

17:28.422 --> 17:30.049
We just made a couple of improvements.

up the paint job a little bit.

17:33.510 --> 17:35.471
That's your new mascot-- Henry Hamster.

17:35.929 --> 17:39.099
We even rented a hamster costume
I can wear while doing skateboard tricks.

17:40.017 --> 17:42.436
