00:06.840 --> 00:09.274
<i>Previously on the affair...</i>

00:09.309 --> 00:11.142
Welcome to the end of the world.

00:11.177 --> 00:12.521
<i>Do you remember
the first time you saw her?</i>

00:12.545 --> 00:14.279
<i>Like it was yesterday.</i>

00:14.314 --> 00:15.747
I'm noah, by the way.

00:15.782 --> 00:16.848
What are we talking about?

00:16.883 --> 00:18.116
Noah's new book.

00:18.151 --> 00:19.417
Great. I didn't know.

00:19.452 --> 00:20.285
There was enough
to talk about yet.

00:20.320 --> 00:21.786
<i>Well,</i>

00:21.821 --> 00:22.999
<i>I haven't really gotten
too far with it.</i>

00:23.023 --> 00:24.023
<i>Is she flirting with you?</i>

00:24.057 --> 00:25.297
Do you want to get out of here?

00:26.393 --> 00:28.493
I don't want to divorce you,
you asshole!

00:28.528 --> 00:30.495
What... what do you want?

00:30.530 --> 00:32.997
I want you to come home.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.299
<i>It's extraordinary.</i>

00:34.334 --> 00:36.200
I want it in stores
by next fall.

00:36.236 --> 00:37.602
<i>I don't want this life.</i>

00:37.637 --> 00:39.437
<i>I have to leave.</i>

00:39.472 --> 00:40.805
<i>I'm in love with someone else.</i>

00:40.840 --> 00:42.140
You have chosen to divorce.

00:42.175 --> 00:44.676
In what I like to call
a humane way.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.844
<i>I blew up my life
for you, alison.</i>

00:46.880 --> 00:48.012
I don't belong to you.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.013
We're not living in your book.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.015
You can't... Control me.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.321
I'm pregnant.

00:58.091 --> 00:59.857
I don't know
who joanie's father is.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.659
I never want to see you again.

01:01.695 --> 01:03.528
And I thought
she had done it deliberately.

01:03.563 --> 01:06.965
<i>To trap me, make sure
I could never go back to you.</i>

01:13.206 --> 01:14.206
Fuck!

01:15.875 --> 01:16.908
It was a deer.

01:16.943 --> 01:18.509
It was a deer!

01:22.382 --> 01:23.748
Alison, if I don't do something,

01:23.783 --> 01:25.249
They're gonna convict me.

01:25.285 --> 01:27.552
<i>I know, just...
Just tell the truth.</i>

01:27.587 --> 01:29.354
Your honor,

01:29.389 --> 01:30.989
I'm guilty.
I killed scott lockhart.

01:31.024 --> 01:33.324
What the hell are you doing?
Sit down.

03:50.530 --> 03:52.196
Ready to go?

04:31.771 --> 04:33.504
Hey.

04:33.540 --> 04:36.507
Hi. Hey.

04:56.429 --> 04:58.396
How are you feeling?

05:01.100 --> 05:02.900
I'm fine.

05:14.514 --> 05:17.148
Thou preparest a table before me.

05:17.183 --> 05:19.951
In the presence of mine enemies.

05:19.986 --> 05:22.653
Thou anointest my head with oil.

05:22.689 --> 05:25.122
My cup runneth over.

05:25.158 --> 05:28.259
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me.

05:28.294 --> 05:30.428
All the days of my life,

05:30.463 --> 05:33.731
And I will dwell in the house
of the lord forever.

05:35.435 --> 05:37.602
We will conclude
our service with a eulogy.

05:37.637 --> 05:39.503
I now invite arthur's son,

05:39.539 --> 05:41.105
Noah solloway,

05:41.140 --> 05:44.742
To share some remembrances
of his beloved father.

05:55.955 --> 05:57.355
Um...

06:07.800 --> 06:09.767
Those of you who knew my dad
will... will know.

06:09.802 --> 06:12.637
That we didn't always
get along so well.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.875
But I-i loved him.

06:20.647 --> 06:22.847
I did love him.

06:22.882 --> 06:26.517
Wh-when I was a boy...

06:26.552 --> 06:28.519
He used to take me fishing
in the... in the lake.

06:28.554 --> 06:32.123
Behind the house
where we grew up, and...

06:39.165 --> 06:41.966
Well,
we both really enjoyed that.

06:42.001 --> 06:44.302
My sister was...

06:46.339 --> 06:47.705
She and my dad were very close.

06:47.740 --> 06:52.410
I think she was...
She was more his type.

06:54.447 --> 06:55.680
But then she left.

06:55.715 --> 06:56.715
Heh.

07:07.560 --> 07:09.160
That was a hard time.

07:11.464 --> 07:13.731
That was a hard time.

07:13.766 --> 07:16.500
He had a... he had a hard life.
At least I think he did.

07:16.536 --> 07:19.904
To be... to be honest,
I-i never really knew him.

07:22.375 --> 07:24.175
Um...

07:27.480 --> 07:29.113
I always wanted to ask
more questions.

07:29.148 --> 07:31.015
You always think
there's gonna be...

07:31.050 --> 07:35.019
more time, but...

07:53.172 --> 07:54.972
Thank you for coming.

07:59.412 --> 08:03.414
Thank you, mr. Solloway,
for those, um, words.

08:03.449 --> 08:06.751
We will now conclude our service
by singing, at his request,

08:06.786 --> 08:08.753
Arthur's favorite song,

08:08.788 --> 08:11.756
"take me out to the ball game."

08:13.292 --> 08:14.959
Thank you for telling
that story, estelle.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.227
It was beautiful.

08:21.033 --> 08:22.600
I'm sorry.

08:22.635 --> 08:25.269
What is the matter with you?

08:25.304 --> 08:27.271
Nothing.

08:27.306 --> 08:28.973
Hey, there's your dad.

08:29.008 --> 08:30.474
Hey.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.176
Hey. Thanks for coming.

08:32.211 --> 08:34.278
I think granddad
would have liked that.

08:34.313 --> 08:36.447
Short and sweet. No bullshit.

08:36.482 --> 08:38.448
Hel... helen,
thank you so much for coming.

08:38.484 --> 08:39.750
You didn't have to do that.

08:39.785 --> 08:41.419
Well, I knew your father
for 30 years,

08:41.453 --> 08:43.254
And you know, where else
would I be?

08:43.289 --> 08:45.289
Can I talk to you for a second?

08:48.394 --> 08:50.161
Come here, sweetie.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.800
You haven't returned
any of my calls.

08:55.835 --> 08:56.634
I know.

08:56.669 --> 08:58.803
Why not?

08:58.838 --> 08:59.703
I don't know.

08:59.739 --> 09:01.372
I... we need to talk.

09:01.407 --> 09:03.174
About what?
About what we're doing.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.743
About what our new arrangement's
going to be.

09:08.648 --> 09:09.858
Are you still living
at your sister's?

09:09.882 --> 09:10.714
Yes.

09:10.750 --> 09:11.549
Well, will you be getting.

09:11.584 --> 09:12.383
A place of your own?

09:12.418 --> 09:13.784
Eventually.

09:13.820 --> 09:14.863
Do... i don't...
Don't you want someplace.

09:14.887 --> 09:16.387
Where you can be with the kids?

09:16.422 --> 09:18.456
They can come to nina's.
I mean alone.

09:18.491 --> 09:20.202
I don't think they want
to be alone with me.

09:20.226 --> 09:22.293
That's ridiculous.
You're their father.

09:22.328 --> 09:24.495
Stacey's afraid of me.
She's not afraid of you.

09:24.530 --> 09:27.531
She's uncomfortable 'cause she
hasn't seen you in three years.

09:27.567 --> 09:31.001
That's why you need
to spend time with her.

09:31.037 --> 09:32.636
Okay, I'm trying. I swear I am.

09:32.672 --> 09:34.071
It's just... it's... it's been...

09:34.106 --> 09:35.306
It's been two months.

09:35.341 --> 09:37.508
Just give me a break, will ya?

09:44.450 --> 09:45.983
Um...

09:47.720 --> 09:49.887
What about us?

09:51.557 --> 09:52.857
What about us?

10:01.567 --> 10:03.100
Excuse me.

10:03.135 --> 10:03.934
Here.

10:03.970 --> 10:05.703
We got it.

10:11.244 --> 10:14.845
"Everyone the father gives to me
will come to me."

10:14.881 --> 10:18.349
I will never turn away
anyone who believes in me.

10:18.384 --> 10:20.351
He who raised Jesus christ
from the dead.

10:20.386 --> 10:22.720
Will also give new life
to our mortal bodies.

10:22.755 --> 10:24.221
Through his indwelling spirit.

10:25.591 --> 10:27.525
My heart, therefore, is glad,

10:27.560 --> 10:30.528
And my spirit rejoices.

10:30.563 --> 10:33.964
My body also shall rest in hope.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.433
You will show me
the path of life.

10:36.469 --> 10:39.136
In your presence
there is fullness of joy,

10:39.171 --> 10:42.706
"And in your right hand
are pleasures forevermore."

10:46.145 --> 10:48.579
noah!

10:48.614 --> 10:50.080
Noah!

10:55.354 --> 10:56.354
Noah!

11:05.698 --> 11:07.342
"The lord lift up
his countenance upon him.

11:07.366 --> 11:09.166
And give him peace."

11:09.201 --> 11:10.134
Amen.

11:10.169 --> 11:12.603
Amen.

11:12.638 --> 11:14.038
Amen.

11:39.732 --> 11:41.699
Thank you so much for coming.

11:49.075 --> 11:50.441
Thanks. Yes, of course.

11:50.476 --> 11:53.010
Thank you.

11:53.045 --> 11:54.011
You okay?

11:54.046 --> 11:55.813
That was a lovely service, nina.

11:55.848 --> 11:58.349
Your father would be pleased.
Thanks.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.362
You're coming back to the house,
though, aren't you?

12:00.386 --> 12:01.952
I don't know.

12:01.988 --> 12:03.687
Come on.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.689
The kids, they haven't
seen each other in forever.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.224
Mine are so looking forward
to it.

12:07.259 --> 12:09.693
Do you think we should
come back to the house?

12:09.729 --> 12:11.228
Only if you want to.

12:16.702 --> 12:18.669
It's a school night, so...

12:18.704 --> 12:21.505
right.

12:21.540 --> 12:23.040
This one time.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.341
Their grandfather just died.

12:24.377 --> 12:25.809
The... the kids
should be together.

12:25.845 --> 12:27.511
Nina, she gave her answer.

12:29.949 --> 12:32.349
We should go. Okay.

12:32.385 --> 12:34.429
Martin needs more time
with his homework this semester.

12:34.453 --> 12:36.353
Because he's been coming home
with cs and ds,

12:36.389 --> 12:38.055
And if he fails out
of another school,

12:38.090 --> 12:39.757
He won't get into college.

12:39.792 --> 12:40.824
Thank you for coming.

12:40.860 --> 12:42.092
Helen.

12:42.128 --> 12:43.927
It was good to see you.

12:47.433 --> 12:48.899
His adviser wants to have.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.345
A parent-teacher conference
next week.

12:50.369 --> 12:52.903
I think you should be there too.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.938
When is it?

12:56.542 --> 12:58.542
It's thursday at four.

12:59.745 --> 13:01.211
Okay, I'll try.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.286
Let's go, mom.

13:09.321 --> 13:12.856
Martin, come and say good-bye
to your father.

13:12.892 --> 13:14.124
Martin, did you hear me?

13:14.160 --> 13:15.893
I said, "come and say
good-bye to your... ".

13:15.928 --> 13:17.895
Don't make him, helen. Please.

13:48.627 --> 13:50.894
You have a lovely home.

13:50.930 --> 13:52.062
Thank you.

13:52.098 --> 13:54.431
It's not mine.

13:54.467 --> 13:57.501
You're not the husband?

13:57.536 --> 13:59.770
I'm sorry, whose husband?

13:59.805 --> 14:01.739
I thought you were
nina's husband.

14:01.774 --> 14:03.807
No, no, no. I'm the brother.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.477
The brother.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.679
The brother who went to prison?

14:10.649 --> 14:12.616
You killed him, you know,

14:12.651 --> 14:14.952
With your antics.

14:14.987 --> 14:18.155
He died of a broken heart.

14:18.190 --> 14:19.990
I thought he died of emphysema.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.092
You're a horror.

14:22.128 --> 14:23.994
Excuse me, donna.

14:24.029 --> 14:26.597
I hope you don't mind terribly.
I'm gonna steal my brother.

14:26.632 --> 14:28.098
Where you going?

14:28.134 --> 14:31.101
To grieve.

14:31.137 --> 14:32.137
Come on.

14:37.376 --> 14:38.376
Here.

14:50.489 --> 14:52.489
Muscle relaxants.

15:04.370 --> 15:06.470
How was teaching this week?

15:06.505 --> 15:08.038
It was fine.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.973
You have any fun?

15:10.009 --> 15:11.208
Not really.

15:12.945 --> 15:15.712
That's not the point, is it?
The point is to have a job.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.849
Well, if they like you,

15:18.884 --> 15:21.051
Then... Maybe they'll give you.

15:21.086 --> 15:23.654
A full-time gig
at the end of the semester.

15:23.689 --> 15:25.022
Maybe.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.593
You should really
shave that beard.

15:29.628 --> 15:30.628
You look insane.

15:34.567 --> 15:37.367
Noah, it's a good university,

15:37.403 --> 15:38.869
And you're a convict.

15:38.904 --> 15:40.304
Ex-convict.

15:42.041 --> 15:44.441
Don't you think
that's part of the appeal?

15:50.816 --> 15:53.784
I'm sorry, I'm just...

15:53.819 --> 15:55.586
I'm having a hard time.

15:55.621 --> 15:59.423
Of course you're having
a hard time.

15:59.458 --> 16:02.960
But it's... it's going
to get better.

16:02.995 --> 16:04.127
You just have to stay...

16:04.163 --> 16:05.729
Alive?

16:05.764 --> 16:07.965
I was going to say "positive."

16:17.476 --> 16:19.910
I think jp's tired of
having me around.

16:19.945 --> 16:21.979
Forget jp. I'll take care of it.

16:22.014 --> 16:24.414
He's just tired in general.

16:24.450 --> 16:26.650
It's just been a long summer.

16:34.793 --> 16:38.362
You know, you're the only one
who's every forgiven me, nin.

16:41.467 --> 16:43.467
<i>Well, you forgave me once.</i>

16:43.502 --> 16:46.136
For something
pretty awful, so...

16:51.810 --> 16:54.011
Besides,
I think you're innocent.

16:59.718 --> 17:01.551
I'm not.

18:14.026 --> 18:15.170
<i>How could he never mention it?</i>

18:15.194 --> 18:16.493
<i>What?</i>

18:16.528 --> 18:17.861
<i>You should have asked him.</i>

18:17.896 --> 18:19.563
<i>What is the matter with you?</i>

18:19.598 --> 18:20.742
<i>I would have never
asked him that.</i>

18:20.766 --> 18:22.265
<i>Just calm down.</i>

18:22.301 --> 18:24.401
<i>We're gonna figure it out, okay?</i>

18:24.436 --> 18:26.937
<i>What do you think
we're gonna do, nina?</i>

18:26.972 --> 18:29.039
<i>How do you think we're
gonna pay for this trip?</i>

18:29.074 --> 18:30.574
<i>And for christmas?</i>

18:30.609 --> 18:32.209
<i>It's got to be
some kind of joke.</i>

18:32.244 --> 18:34.745
<i>Your brother?
Your fucking brother?</i>

18:37.883 --> 18:39.483
Everything okay?

18:42.221 --> 18:44.788
Your father's will arrived
this morning.

18:51.630 --> 18:52.896
Okay.

18:55.434 --> 18:57.434
He didn't have much to leave.

18:59.304 --> 19:01.605
He had his house...

19:01.640 --> 19:04.041
Which he left to you.

19:04.076 --> 19:05.275
To me?

19:07.079 --> 19:08.278
Why?

19:08.313 --> 19:09.880
I don't know, noah.

19:09.915 --> 19:11.915
Why don't you tell us?

19:13.452 --> 19:15.452
I don't know either.

19:16.755 --> 19:18.255
You know he hated you?

19:18.290 --> 19:20.724
Jp. No, no, no.

19:20.759 --> 19:24.561
He could barely talk about you.

19:24.596 --> 19:26.129
She's the one.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.931
Who went to see him
every sunday.

19:27.966 --> 19:29.433
She took him to church.

19:29.468 --> 19:31.234
She took him to the doctor's.

19:31.270 --> 19:32.903
She changed his oxygen.

19:32.938 --> 19:36.139
She changed his fuckin' diapers.

19:36.175 --> 19:39.509
You know that we had to pay
for a live-in nurse at the end?

19:40.679 --> 19:41.912
We're in something of a hole.

19:41.947 --> 19:42.746
Here at the moment.

19:42.781 --> 19:43.647
Doesn't matter.

19:43.682 --> 19:44.481
It doesn't?

19:44.516 --> 19:45.916
And why's that?

19:45.951 --> 19:47.918
Because you planted a money tree
in the backyard,

19:47.953 --> 19:50.320
And we can just go out
and pick some fucking bills?

19:50.355 --> 19:51.154
You're embarrassing me.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.489
I am?

19:52.524 --> 19:54.624
Has he even paid
for groceries once?

19:54.660 --> 19:56.159
Once since he's been here?

19:56.195 --> 19:58.261
Just go take a walk, please.

19:58.297 --> 20:00.130
He's just like
your fuckin' father.

20:00.165 --> 20:01.698
Get out!

20:07.539 --> 20:09.806
We needed that house, nina.

20:15.481 --> 20:18.148
We needed it.

20:18.183 --> 20:21.318
Fuck it.

20:25.891 --> 20:26.790
Here, let me.

20:26.825 --> 20:28.658
No, I got it.

20:28.694 --> 20:30.560
I got it.

20:44.042 --> 20:45.642
I'll pick you up at six.

20:45.677 --> 20:47.878
No, I told you, I'll...

20:47.913 --> 20:49.045
I'll find my own place.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.514
You have no money.

20:50.549 --> 20:52.149
I have a little.

20:52.184 --> 20:53.250
I'll manage.

20:53.285 --> 20:56.253
Just... Let me talk to jp, okay?

20:56.288 --> 20:57.320
He will calm down.

20:57.356 --> 20:59.556
I don't want the house.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.094
Just tell jp he can have it.

21:04.129 --> 21:05.562
He can sell it. I don't care.

21:05.597 --> 21:08.031
He can't have it.
Dad left it to you.

21:08.066 --> 21:10.767
I'm never going back there,
nina.

21:10.802 --> 21:12.435
You know that.

21:14.306 --> 21:16.540
He was trying to apologize.

21:16.575 --> 21:18.542
Yeah, well,
it's too late for that.

21:20.045 --> 21:21.045
Fuckhead.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.714
It's way too late for that.

21:33.725 --> 21:35.692
"And so in the end,."

21:35.727 --> 21:37.894
As she watched him
get back into his car.

21:37.930 --> 21:40.597
And drive back
down the mountain,

21:40.632 --> 21:42.966
She couldn't help but wonder,

21:43.001 --> 21:45.402
Would she feel differently
in the morning?

21:45.437 --> 21:48.405
Would she wake up again
with that sense of possibility.

21:48.440 --> 21:51.808
That she'd taken for granted
as a girl?

21:51.843 --> 21:53.210
In other words,

21:53.245 --> 21:55.245
Is this moment the end
of her beginning.

21:55.280 --> 21:58.315
Or the beginning of her end?

21:58.350 --> 22:00.116
She was still
pondering the question.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.152
When she heard
the teakettle whistle.

22:02.187 --> 22:04.821
And turned from the window.

22:04.856 --> 22:08.091
"When she looked back again,
his car was gone."

22:09.861 --> 22:11.228
The end.

22:18.971 --> 22:21.905
Mr. Solloway?

22:21.940 --> 22:25.308
Yeah, th... thanks.
Thanks, audrey.

22:29.715 --> 22:31.715
Questions, comments, concerns?

22:39.558 --> 22:42.292
Charlette?

22:42.327 --> 22:44.761
I thought it was really elegant,
audrey.

22:44.796 --> 22:47.831
I liked the wind imagery.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.699
I felt your narrator's
excitement.

22:49.735 --> 22:51.968
When the weather patterns
changed unexpectedly.

22:57.476 --> 22:59.876
You don't agree, mr. Solloway?

23:01.513 --> 23:04.180
No, charlette, I don't.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.549
I thought it was very dull.

23:06.585 --> 23:08.285
Unless it was
supposed to be a satire.

23:08.320 --> 23:09.653
Was it?

23:11.523 --> 23:13.890
No. No, I didn't think it was.

23:13.925 --> 23:16.359
Unfortunately, all that audrey
has revealed here today.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.561
Is how shockingly unoriginal.

23:18.597 --> 23:20.363
Her inner life actually is.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.699
It would probably behoove you
to turn off your computer,

23:22.734 --> 23:24.801
Get off your couch,
and go outside.

23:24.836 --> 23:27.971
And risk some live,
human interactions.

23:28.006 --> 23:29.739
So you could observe
the idiosyncrasies.

23:29.775 --> 23:30.840
Of actual behavior.

23:30.876 --> 23:32.509
Better yet, leave campus.

23:32.544 --> 23:34.144
Go visit some
struggling neighborhood.

23:34.179 --> 23:36.646
And see real people
try to deal with real problems.

23:36.682 --> 23:38.548
And then go home
and write about that.

23:38.583 --> 23:39.549
Or don't. I don't care.

23:39.584 --> 23:41.518
Just...

23:41.553 --> 23:44.254
just don't bring
your diary in here again.

23:49.127 --> 23:50.427
Who's next?

23:53.398 --> 23:55.065
Why are you crying?

24:06.311 --> 24:08.111
Why was she crying?

24:08.146 --> 24:10.146
You eviscerated her, dude.

24:13.118 --> 24:15.251
Listen, kids, if...
If you want to be a writer,

24:15.287 --> 24:17.127
You better get used to
people hating your work.

24:17.155 --> 24:19.856
Why you got to denigrate
her experience, mr. Solloway?

24:19.891 --> 24:22.258
It's not like your novels
have been paradigms.

24:22.294 --> 24:25.295
Of diverse socioeconomic
representation.

25:13.812 --> 25:15.178
<i>Hi, yeah,</i>

25:15.213 --> 25:16.813
<i>This is, professor solloway.</i>

25:16.848 --> 25:19.749
We spoke about the apartment
you're subletting.

25:19.785 --> 25:22.185
I'm... i'm... i'm right outside now.

25:23.188 --> 25:25.155
Hey.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.157
Noah.

26:23.181 --> 26:24.681
You look great.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.188
Helen, it's okay.

26:32.224 --> 26:33.990
Helen, tell me about the kids.

26:34.025 --> 26:35.525
They're fine.

26:35.560 --> 26:37.327
Are they coming to visit?
Yeah, of course.

26:37.362 --> 26:39.496
I just wanted to come myself
first to make sure.

26:39.531 --> 26:40.531
That it was safe, and...

26:43.635 --> 26:46.903
My god, I can't...
I can't believe you're in here.

26:46.938 --> 26:49.906
It's okay. No, it's not okay.

26:49.941 --> 26:53.376
I can't believe you did this.
Why did you do this?

26:53.411 --> 26:54.889
Somebody needed
to take responsibility.

26:54.913 --> 26:56.412
No, that's not true.

26:56.448 --> 26:58.281
That's not how
the justice system works.

26:58.316 --> 26:59.582
Juries hang.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.117
Murderers go free.

27:01.152 --> 27:03.686
Oj simpson wasn't convicted.
Why the fuck were you?

27:03.722 --> 27:06.489
Well, I didn't want to leave
anything to chance.

27:09.494 --> 27:11.060
Listen, it...

27:11.096 --> 27:12.640
There's nothing
we can do about it now.

27:12.664 --> 27:14.408
You and the kids are safe.
That's all that matters.

27:14.432 --> 27:16.299
I'm gonna get you out of here.
No, you're not.

27:16.334 --> 27:18.201
Yes, I am.
I'm going to speak to my father.

27:18.236 --> 27:19.269
Your father.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.037
Yes, he... he knows the governor.

27:21.072 --> 27:22.472
He helped get him elected.

27:22.507 --> 27:24.707
Maybe he can get
your sentence transmuted.

27:24.743 --> 27:25.708
You mean "commuted"?

27:25.744 --> 27:27.210
This is ridiculous.

27:27.245 --> 27:30.246
You can't be here.

27:30.282 --> 27:32.549
Not that bad, actually.

27:32.584 --> 27:34.784
I have my own cell.
I get plenty of exercise.

27:34.819 --> 27:36.953
I even like some of the guys.
They're very smart.

27:36.988 --> 27:40.056
They've... Led fascinating lives.

27:40.091 --> 27:42.625
Might even use a few of them
for research for my new novel.

27:42.661 --> 27:43.905
This is not
a writers retreat, noah.

27:43.929 --> 27:44.894
You're incarcerated.

27:44.930 --> 27:46.429
Can't it be both?

27:49.100 --> 27:52.569
Helen, don't worry about me.

27:52.604 --> 27:56.005
I'm tougher than you think I am.

27:56.041 --> 27:59.242
And I owe this to you...

27:59.277 --> 28:01.444
After what I put you through.

28:04.983 --> 28:08.351
Maybe this is my way
of wiping the slate clean.

28:11.189 --> 28:12.266
Besides, they're not
gonna keep me here.

28:12.290 --> 28:13.323
For the full three years.

28:13.358 --> 28:15.792
I'll be out before you know it.

28:20.832 --> 28:22.999
And what about me?

28:25.303 --> 28:29.472
What am I supposed to do
while you're in here?

28:29.507 --> 28:31.841
Just wait.

28:37.916 --> 28:40.383
Consider the arthurian
character merlin.

28:40.418 --> 28:42.151
Merlin.

28:42.187 --> 28:43.786
Born to a virgin.

28:43.822 --> 28:47.890
Who had been impregnated
by a devil.

28:47.926 --> 28:51.861
Merlin's internal integration
of the two sides to his soul.

28:51.896 --> 28:55.465
Establishes him as one of our
earliest archetypes for the...

28:55.500 --> 28:57.300
<i>Quel est le mot?</i>

28:57.335 --> 29:00.236
For... hello.

29:00.271 --> 29:01.904
You just popped up
out of nowhere.

29:01.940 --> 29:03.973
What's your name?

29:04.009 --> 29:06.509
Are you in the right place?

29:06.544 --> 29:10.013
No, no, sorry.

29:10.048 --> 29:11.247
I think I'm...

29:11.282 --> 29:13.182
I'm sorry to put you
on the spot.

29:13.218 --> 29:14.729
It's just that I've asked
everyone else.

29:14.753 --> 29:15.885
To introduce themselves,

29:15.920 --> 29:19.055
And I didn't see you there.

29:19.090 --> 29:22.392
I-I'm noah... Solloway.

29:28.700 --> 29:31.501
<i>Bienvenue, monsieur solloway.</i>

29:31.536 --> 29:33.603
<i>Je suis professeur le gall.</i>

29:38.109 --> 29:40.243
So...

29:40.278 --> 29:42.512
Where were we?

29:42.547 --> 29:43.513
<i>Oui.</i>

29:43.548 --> 29:45.682
The struggle.

29:45.717 --> 29:47.884
Merlin... merlin is an archetype.

29:47.919 --> 29:50.053
For the struggle, perhaps, the...

29:50.088 --> 29:51.721
<i>The war, la guerre, oui...</i>

29:51.756 --> 29:53.589
He's an archetype for the war.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.191
Between one's conscious mind.

29:55.226 --> 29:59.962
And its self-destructive
subconscious desire.

29:59.998 --> 30:03.132
In robert de boron's
early version of the tale,

30:03.168 --> 30:05.968
Merlin's virtuous side
overcomes his demonic side,

30:06.004 --> 30:08.638
His holy destiny intact.

30:08.673 --> 30:11.974
Yet a slightly later version
of the exact same tale.

30:12.010 --> 30:15.144
Depicts merlin as
irredeemably tainted.

30:15.180 --> 30:16.779
By his infernal paternity,

30:16.815 --> 30:19.716
His lightness this time
completely destroyed.

30:19.751 --> 30:21.284
By his darkness.

30:21.319 --> 30:22.819
In this post-vulgate version,

30:22.854 --> 30:24.921
We see the fictional shadow self.

30:24.956 --> 30:29.325
Become a manifestation of
the writer's own depravity,

30:29.360 --> 30:32.495
A shadow of a shadow,

30:32.530 --> 30:36.799
Destined to be destroyed
by its creator.

30:50.648 --> 30:51.981
<i>Monsieur solloway.</i>

30:52.016 --> 30:53.216
<i>Attendez, s'il vous plaÃƒÂ®t.</i>

30:56.488 --> 30:58.855
I'm just so pleased
to finally meet you.

30:58.890 --> 31:01.657
I feel that you and I
are kindred spirits.

31:01.693 --> 31:03.693
Kindred spirits?
Silence is violence!

31:03.728 --> 31:04.728
How so?

31:06.131 --> 31:07.663
No means no!

31:07.699 --> 31:09.365
Silence is violence!

31:09.400 --> 31:10.333
Silence is violence!

31:10.368 --> 31:11.834
Was there a rape?

31:11.870 --> 31:15.838
I'm not sure.
It's apparently a bit murky.

31:15.874 --> 31:18.608
But I admire them,
these students.

31:18.643 --> 31:22.278
They're adamant when they feel
they're being mistreated.

31:22.313 --> 31:23.613
I was quite surprised.

31:23.648 --> 31:26.349
It's not the same in france.

31:26.384 --> 31:28.384
They're after you too, you know.

31:28.419 --> 31:30.686
Who? The students.

31:30.722 --> 31:33.122
Some of the faculty.

31:33.158 --> 31:35.035
There was a big conversation,
before you arrived.

31:35.059 --> 31:38.327
About whether it was safe
to have you on the campus.

31:38.363 --> 31:40.129
Why?

31:40.165 --> 31:42.465
You just got out of prison, no?

31:42.500 --> 31:44.467
Okay.

31:44.502 --> 31:46.736
And you're a murderer, yes?

31:46.771 --> 31:48.371
Silence is violence!

31:48.406 --> 31:50.373
No means no!

31:50.408 --> 31:52.208
No means no!

31:52.243 --> 31:54.010
Silence is violence!

31:54.045 --> 31:56.846
So, are you happy here?

31:56.881 --> 31:58.881
Are you glad you came?

32:00.952 --> 32:02.185
Well, it's...

32:02.220 --> 32:03.220
It's better than prison.

32:06.791 --> 32:08.269
I'll have to remember that
on the days

32:08.293 --> 32:10.259
I'm feeling
particularly depressed.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.663
Why are you depressed?

32:13.698 --> 32:15.064
"Depressed" is probably wrong.

32:15.099 --> 32:18.267
<i>I just feel... Bored. Ennui.</i>

32:18.303 --> 32:19.702
I thought I'd come to america.

32:19.737 --> 32:22.171
And have a grand adventure,
you know?

32:22.207 --> 32:24.674
I'd be at a famous university,

32:24.709 --> 32:27.410
Arguing with passionate students
late into the nights.

32:27.445 --> 32:30.546
And instead, it's, um...

32:30.582 --> 32:31.948
Instead, it's new jersey.

32:31.983 --> 32:33.950
Yes.

32:33.985 --> 32:37.286
Where everyone is just so...

32:37.322 --> 32:39.121
Nice.

32:40.758 --> 32:42.592
Before I began,
I got a kind of a...

32:42.627 --> 32:44.527
<i>A merde...</i>

32:44.562 --> 32:47.263
How do you say?
A sermon from the dean.

32:47.298 --> 32:49.866
About making the students
feel secure.

32:49.901 --> 32:52.735
I thought,
"secure, at a university? Why?"

32:52.770 --> 32:54.237
I don't remember.

32:54.272 --> 32:56.606
Feeling secure
when I was in school, do you?

32:56.641 --> 32:57.807
No. You see?

32:57.842 --> 32:59.141
<i>I said, "monsieur,".</i>

32:59.177 --> 33:00.877
Surely our job
is to challenge them,

33:00.912 --> 33:03.613
"To unsettle, to make them
feel insecure, no?"

33:03.648 --> 33:04.914
No.

33:07.585 --> 33:09.552
Yeah, it wasn't always
like this.

33:09.587 --> 33:12.822
I remember back when I was
teaching high school,

33:12.857 --> 33:15.725
I started noticing
a change after 9/11.

33:16.928 --> 33:18.339
The president
came on the television.

33:18.363 --> 33:20.274
And started talking about
keeping americans safe,

33:20.298 --> 33:22.932
And suddenly all the students
were repeating it.

33:22.967 --> 33:24.934
And these current students,
they're...

33:24.969 --> 33:27.937
They're even younger, and...
And they've grown up.

33:27.972 --> 33:31.173
On a whole rhetoric of s...

33:35.613 --> 33:37.947
noah, are you all right?

33:37.982 --> 33:41.350
Yeah. Yeah...

33:47.458 --> 33:49.859
I'm having a small
dinner party tonight.

33:49.894 --> 33:51.360
Would you like to come?

33:54.065 --> 33:56.165
Sure. Okay.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.700
<i>TrÃƒÂ¨s bien.</i>

34:01.572 --> 34:03.539
So sorry I'm late.

34:05.343 --> 34:06.809
Shall we?

34:10.380 --> 34:12.148
You're teaching only
one class, correct?

34:12.183 --> 34:13.516
That's right, yeah.

34:13.551 --> 34:16.552
I... I'm hoping
for more next semester.

34:16.587 --> 34:17.954
How's it going?

34:17.989 --> 34:19.688
Well, I think.

34:19.724 --> 34:22.458
I think it's going well.

34:22.493 --> 34:24.493
No trouble?

34:25.897 --> 34:27.530
Nope.

34:28.666 --> 34:31.067
The job ends in december?

34:31.101 --> 34:33.069
Yes, but... There's a...

34:33.103 --> 34:34.681
There's a possibility
I'll be invited back.

34:34.706 --> 34:36.539
For the spring term.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.206
And if you're not?

34:43.880 --> 34:45.481
I don't know.

34:45.516 --> 34:47.360
It's important that you stay
employed, mr. Solloway,

34:47.385 --> 34:49.351
As part of your rehabilitation.

34:49.387 --> 34:51.821
I know.

34:51.856 --> 34:54.056
Are you waiting for somebody?

34:54.092 --> 34:55.558
No, no, sorry. I ju...

34:55.592 --> 34:57.059
How's your living situation?

34:57.094 --> 34:59.195
You still at your sister's?

34:59.230 --> 35:00.696
No.

35:00.732 --> 35:03.532
No? You moved?
As of today... tonight.

35:03.568 --> 35:05.601
And you didn't feel it was
important that I know?

35:05.636 --> 35:06.669
It... it just happened.

35:06.704 --> 35:08.070
It's student housing.

35:08.106 --> 35:10.339
I'm subletting from...
From an undergraduate.

35:10.375 --> 35:11.741
I need to visit.

35:11.776 --> 35:13.743
I need to see it.

35:13.778 --> 35:14.788
Well, we can go right now
if you like.

35:14.812 --> 35:16.445
I-I got the key, we...

35:16.481 --> 35:19.281
No, I'd rather come by
when you least expect it.

35:19.317 --> 35:20.850
Of course.

35:20.885 --> 35:22.184
Why'd you move?

35:22.220 --> 35:23.185
Trouble with your sister?

35:23.221 --> 35:24.086
No, no, no.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.755
No, I just...

35:25.790 --> 35:28.791
I just wanted to live...
Live closer to work.

35:33.097 --> 35:34.730
Okay, mr. Solloway.

35:34.766 --> 35:36.132
Stay employed.

35:36.167 --> 35:37.967
Don't piss anybody off.

35:38.002 --> 35:40.736
We'll be in touch.

35:40.772 --> 35:42.738
Thanks so much for coming.

35:42.774 --> 35:45.775
It's my job.
They pay me to do this.

35:47.945 --> 35:49.512
Officer santos.

35:51.649 --> 35:53.616
Who... who knows I'm here?

35:53.651 --> 35:55.251
What do you mean?

35:55.286 --> 35:57.887
Well, is there a record of my...
Where I live now?

35:57.922 --> 36:01.323
Or where I work?
On a database anywhere?

36:01.359 --> 36:03.092
Why are you asking?

36:03.127 --> 36:05.494
I'm just wondering if it's...
If it's possible for...

36:05.530 --> 36:07.963
For anybody still
inside fishkill.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.099
To find out my current address?

36:10.134 --> 36:12.168
As in other prisoners?
Of course not.

36:12.203 --> 36:15.438
Or a guard.
Could a guard, for example,

36:15.473 --> 36:18.140
Have access to that information?

36:18.176 --> 36:20.976
Why are you asking, solloway?

36:21.012 --> 36:24.747
Never mind. It's not important.

36:24.782 --> 36:27.683
Is there anything
you need to tell me?

36:27.718 --> 36:29.618
No.

36:29.654 --> 36:32.021
Here, let me walk you out.

37:52.436 --> 37:54.336
Come on, man!

37:57.909 --> 38:00.376
Stop, stop!

38:03.214 --> 38:04.358
Whoa, whoa,
where do you think you...

38:04.382 --> 38:06.549
You gonna have to
pay for that shit.

38:08.586 --> 38:10.452
Here, enough? Is that enough?

38:10.488 --> 38:11.453
Yeah.

38:11.489 --> 38:12.588
We're cool, man.

38:12.623 --> 38:14.223
You're good.

39:01.372 --> 39:04.139
Audrey, I-i didn't know
you'd be here.

39:04.175 --> 39:06.675
Professor le gall is my adviser.

39:06.711 --> 39:07.910
Is she?

39:07.945 --> 39:09.511
<i>Oui.</i>

39:19.490 --> 39:20.956
For god's sakes, audrey,

39:20.992 --> 39:23.092
Nobody is condoning rape.

39:23.127 --> 39:25.094
We're just saying that
the term "sexual assault".

39:25.129 --> 39:27.663
Is so expansively used now.

39:27.698 --> 39:29.331
That it dilutes public outrage.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.834
For the very crime
you're trying to prosecute.

39:31.869 --> 39:33.102
Really, mike?

39:33.137 --> 39:35.170
Because a woman
who cries sexual assault.

39:35.206 --> 39:37.006
Might just be looking
for attention?

39:37.041 --> 39:40.009
Or... or maybe she was confused.
Maybe she really did want it.

39:40.044 --> 39:41.443
Maybe she did. Maybe she did,

39:41.479 --> 39:43.212
And then maybe
she regretted it later.

39:43.247 --> 39:45.492
I mean, I've certainly regretted
sleeping with certain people.

39:45.516 --> 39:46.815
But when I do, I don't bring.

39:46.851 --> 39:47.894
A disciplinary charge
against them.

39:47.918 --> 39:49.485
Fuck you, cornwall.

39:49.520 --> 39:51.520
You know, you ladies...
Not you, professor...

39:51.555 --> 39:53.822
But you two are on a witch-hunt.

39:53.858 --> 39:55.157
No. Excuse me?

39:55.192 --> 39:56.336
Yes, you are.
You are, and I get it.

39:56.360 --> 39:57.693
No, no, no, no. I get it.

39:57.728 --> 39:59.695
You've been victims of
this systematized...

39:59.730 --> 40:00.829
patriarchal.

40:00.865 --> 40:02.042
Oppression for many years now...

40:02.066 --> 40:03.799
stop talking. Just stop talking.

40:03.834 --> 40:05.312
But that doesn't give you
the right to terrorize us.

40:05.336 --> 40:06.902
Terrorize you? Terrorize, yes.

40:06.937 --> 40:10.239
I feel terrified to touch
a woman at a party now,

40:10.274 --> 40:12.207
Especially if she's had a drink,

40:12.243 --> 40:14.209
Because if I take her home,
right,

40:14.245 --> 40:16.178
And I fuck her,
the next morning I wake up,

40:16.213 --> 40:18.580
And I... and I don't tell her
that I-i love her.

40:18.616 --> 40:20.082
Or that I want to marry her,

40:20.117 --> 40:21.850
She can literally prosecute me.

40:21.886 --> 40:24.753
Okay, I stopped listening
at the part where she fucks you,

40:24.789 --> 40:26.400
Because that's where your story
lost all credibility.

40:26.424 --> 40:28.057
Come on, professor.

40:28.092 --> 40:29.658
Blake, back me up here.
He's right.

40:29.694 --> 40:31.371
All this talk of consent
is just demoralizing.

40:31.395 --> 40:32.361
"Demoralizing"?

40:32.396 --> 40:33.562
It's fucking confusing.

40:33.597 --> 40:34.563
It's not that confusing.

40:34.598 --> 40:35.898
Ask her what she wants.

40:35.933 --> 40:36.999
I don't want to ask her.

40:37.034 --> 40:38.167
Why the fuck not?

40:38.202 --> 40:40.669
Because asking isn't sexy.

40:40.705 --> 40:43.072
Professor le gall, you
must have an opinion about this.

40:43.107 --> 40:45.174
Professor le gall is an expert.

40:45.209 --> 40:47.409
<i>In courtly love,</i>

40:47.445 --> 40:49.511
And I'm pretty sure
that lancelot.

40:49.547 --> 40:52.214
Never asked guinevere
for permission to slip it in.

40:52.249 --> 40:54.016
Actually, mike,
if that's what you think,

40:54.051 --> 40:55.529
Then you haven't been
paying enough attention.

40:55.553 --> 40:57.052
In my lectures.

40:57.088 --> 40:59.755
In courtly love,
the woman is always in charge.

40:59.790 --> 41:01.557
She is the lord and master.

41:01.592 --> 41:03.225
And the knight is her servant.

41:03.260 --> 41:05.361
And even when he cannot
consummate his passion,

41:05.396 --> 41:07.129
As is often the case,

41:07.164 --> 41:09.398
The very act of loving her.

41:09.433 --> 41:11.400
Enriches his life...

41:11.435 --> 41:13.202
And improves his nobility.

41:14.438 --> 41:16.372
Imagine that, mike.

41:16.407 --> 41:20.242
A man loving a woman
who he doesn't get to fuck.

41:20.277 --> 41:21.977
That's not true, all right?

41:22.012 --> 41:24.246
You... you said "erotic love."

41:24.281 --> 41:26.415
I wrote down the word "erotic"
in my notebook.

41:26.450 --> 41:28.150
I-I circled it three times,
professor.

41:28.185 --> 41:31.220
But erotic doesn't always
mean physical.

41:31.255 --> 41:35.090
Sometimes the woman
invites the man into her bed,

41:35.126 --> 41:37.426
And he's not allowed
to touch her.

41:37.461 --> 41:39.595
Is there anything more erotic
than that?

41:41.132 --> 41:41.930
You want to know what
my problem is.

41:41.966 --> 41:43.165
With courtly love?

41:43.200 --> 41:44.666
It's just exhausting
for the guys.

41:44.702 --> 41:45.667
Yes. I mean, all those.

41:45.703 --> 41:47.136
Fuckin' ordeals.

41:47.171 --> 41:49.238
To prove their ardor
and commitment.

41:49.273 --> 41:50.939
Joust upon joust upon joust.
Joust!

41:50.975 --> 41:52.975
I mean, stop faking.
Just give me the bacon, baby.

41:53.010 --> 41:54.243
Bacon. That's it.

41:54.278 --> 41:56.245
What's up, right?

41:56.280 --> 41:59.581
What about you,
professor solloway?

41:59.617 --> 42:01.083
Me?

42:01.118 --> 42:04.620
What do you make
of our conversation?

42:04.655 --> 42:07.156
Well, I'm,
I'm fascinated, of course.

42:07.191 --> 42:09.625
Do you know much
about courtly love?

42:10.995 --> 42:12.327
No.

42:12.363 --> 42:15.264
Sexual assault?

42:15.299 --> 42:17.666
<i>There's a chapter
in your last book, descent,</i>

42:17.701 --> 42:20.269
That I've been meaning
to ask you about.

42:20.304 --> 42:21.970
It's the part where you.

42:22.006 --> 42:25.841
Have sex with your wife
against the tree.

42:25.876 --> 42:29.344
Was that supposed to be a rape?

42:29.380 --> 42:31.547
Well, I don't think this
is the appropriate context.

42:31.582 --> 42:33.348
To discuss my book.

42:33.384 --> 42:34.950
No, please.

42:34.985 --> 42:36.318
We're interested.

42:38.222 --> 42:40.456
See, the thing is,
professor solloway,

42:40.491 --> 42:42.524
When we heard that
you were coming to teach,

42:42.560 --> 42:44.493
We were all a little nervous.

42:44.528 --> 42:45.794
I mean, you have to understand.

42:45.830 --> 42:48.330
That your reputation
precedes you,

42:48.365 --> 42:50.799
And I guess I would
just feel a lot safer.

42:50.835 --> 42:54.303
In your class if I understood
your attitude toward consent.

42:54.338 --> 42:56.472
And women in general.

42:58.042 --> 43:00.909
My attitude
towards women in general?

43:09.220 --> 43:10.752
Well, in general, audrey,

43:10.788 --> 43:12.855
I, I-i approve of women.

43:12.890 --> 43:14.656
I think you're all great.

43:14.692 --> 43:16.425
And... and, no,

43:16.460 --> 43:19.728
I did not consider it
to be a... a scene of rape.

43:19.763 --> 43:22.431
What was it, then?

43:22.466 --> 43:24.333
Um...

43:24.368 --> 43:26.034
Dominant sex.

43:26.070 --> 43:27.536
But it wasn't rape? No.

43:27.571 --> 43:29.238
And there's a difference? Yes.

43:29.273 --> 43:33.008
Would you say that lana
consented to that experience?

43:34.278 --> 43:36.178
Well, no, but I'd say

43:36.213 --> 43:37.613
I think she enjoyed it.

43:37.648 --> 43:39.348
Are you fucking kidding me?

43:39.383 --> 43:40.883
My point is, I-i don't...

43:41.952 --> 43:43.685
I think sex can be about both.

43:43.721 --> 43:46.088
Wanting and not wanting.

43:46.123 --> 43:47.890
It's... it's a war.

43:47.925 --> 43:51.260
Between the intellect
and instinct,

43:51.295 --> 43:52.961
Between shame and desire,

43:52.997 --> 43:55.898
And that's what makes it
so interesting, and...

43:55.933 --> 43:57.466
Also, to your first point,

43:57.501 --> 44:00.936
Frankly impossible to legislate.

44:00.971 --> 44:03.071
<i>Merveilleux.</i>

44:03.107 --> 44:05.374
Professor,
he's a rape apologist.

44:05.409 --> 44:07.042
I don't even know why.

44:07.077 --> 44:08.277
We're asking him.

44:08.312 --> 44:09.912
The man basically wrote
a self-help book.

44:09.947 --> 44:11.914
On how to cheat on your wife
and get away with it.

44:11.949 --> 44:14.049
<i>My god.
That's not how I read descent.</i>

44:14.084 --> 44:15.317
Did you read it in english?

44:15.352 --> 44:17.252
Because, believe us,
that book is.

44:17.288 --> 44:19.054
A training manual
for how to be an asshole.

44:19.089 --> 44:21.790
What I read was the account
of a courageous man.

44:21.825 --> 44:24.259
Who falls into a true love.

44:24.295 --> 44:27.229
With a woman who isn't his wife.

44:27.264 --> 44:30.299
And risks everything
to be with her.

44:30.334 --> 44:32.301
A kind of a lancelot.

44:33.938 --> 44:36.438
But perhaps I misunderstood.

44:53.958 --> 44:56.158
Do you mind if I join you?

45:06.971 --> 45:08.070
Want one?

45:10.874 --> 45:13.442
No, thanks.

45:13.477 --> 45:15.877
You don't smoke?

45:15.913 --> 45:17.412
No.

45:21.352 --> 45:23.352
Listen, audrey,
I wanted to apologize.

45:23.387 --> 45:27.356
For the way I treated you
in class today.

45:30.828 --> 45:32.995
It wasn't my best day.

45:39.403 --> 45:43.972
Do you really feel unsafe
in my class?

45:52.016 --> 45:53.815
Is it a possibility
that feeling that way.

45:53.851 --> 45:57.819
Could maybe compel you
to take more risks as a writer?

45:59.690 --> 46:02.758
Take you out
of your comfort zone?

46:06.930 --> 46:10.032
Professor solloway,

46:10.067 --> 46:11.433
What you don't seem
to understand.

46:11.468 --> 46:13.835
About women in general.

46:13.871 --> 46:16.271
Is that we feel unsafe
all the time.

46:16.306 --> 46:19.341
At class. At parties.

46:19.376 --> 46:21.209
Job interviews.

46:21.245 --> 46:23.745
You know,
getting into an elevator.

46:23.781 --> 46:25.047
Parking our cars.

46:25.082 --> 46:28.350
Walking down the street
at night.

46:28.385 --> 46:31.920
I don't need you to push me
out of my comfort zone.

46:31.955 --> 46:34.423
I've never been inside one.

46:37.928 --> 46:40.729
I'm sorry, audrey, i...

46:47.171 --> 46:50.739
I've been away for a long time,
and i... I-i guess

46:50.774 --> 46:54.242
I'm out of practice. I-i...

46:54.278 --> 46:57.245
I've... i've forgotten how to...

46:59.983 --> 47:02.317
Talk to people.

47:02.352 --> 47:04.853
<i>Qu'est-ce qui se passe?</i>

47:06.490 --> 47:07.989
Want a tour?

47:09.426 --> 47:11.426
Yeah.

47:11.462 --> 47:12.462
Sure.

47:19.036 --> 47:22.437
This used to be a boarding house
for wayward women.

47:22.473 --> 47:25.941
Way back at the turn of
the last century.

47:25.976 --> 47:27.943
It's true.

47:38.722 --> 47:40.322
Viola.

47:40.357 --> 47:42.357
What do you think?

47:45.562 --> 47:46.461
This your room?

47:46.497 --> 47:47.896
Yes.

47:49.299 --> 47:50.265
I like it.

47:50.300 --> 47:51.666
I like it too.

47:51.702 --> 47:52.667
It smells familiar.

47:52.703 --> 47:53.969
I don't know what it is.

47:54.004 --> 47:56.805
It reminds me of home.

47:56.840 --> 48:00.308
Were you offended by
the conversation downstairs?

48:00.344 --> 48:02.677
Nah, of course not.

48:02.713 --> 48:06.148
They're all entitled to
their... Opinions.

48:06.183 --> 48:07.449
They're young.

48:07.484 --> 48:10.118
They want everything to be
black and white.

48:10.154 --> 48:13.155
And the tragedy is,
you can't move them beyond that.

48:13.190 --> 48:14.790
No matter how much.

48:14.825 --> 48:17.159
You tell them, no matter
how many books they read,

48:17.194 --> 48:19.694
There are just some things
that can't be taught,

48:19.730 --> 48:22.964
Things like humility and loss.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.367
And desire.

48:29.106 --> 48:31.006
I loved your book.

48:34.211 --> 48:35.677
Thank you.

48:35.712 --> 48:37.746
Is there going to be
another one?

48:37.781 --> 48:39.181
I hope so, eventually.

48:39.216 --> 48:41.016
About the same people?

48:41.051 --> 48:44.820
No, no. No, i...

48:44.855 --> 48:46.488
I mean, it's an old book.

48:46.523 --> 48:48.089
You know?

48:48.125 --> 48:50.158
I'm not writing
that kind of thing anymore.

48:50.194 --> 48:51.693
Why not?

48:51.728 --> 48:54.262
Why, it's... i'm just...

48:54.298 --> 48:55.897
Tell you the truth,
I don't really.

48:55.933 --> 48:57.499
Recognize that author.

48:59.303 --> 49:01.603
People change.

49:01.638 --> 49:02.604
Yeah.

49:02.639 --> 49:03.605
Lucky for you.

49:03.640 --> 49:05.006
You have a paper record.

49:05.042 --> 49:07.142
Of the man you used to be.

49:09.379 --> 49:11.546
Whereas for most of us
that younger person only exists.

49:11.582 --> 49:13.582
In our memory.

49:17.955 --> 49:19.955
I'm glad you're here.

49:27.297 --> 49:30.265
I was beginning to think.

49:30.300 --> 49:34.302
There wasn't anyone interesting
to talk to in all of new jersey.

49:37.274 --> 49:42.244
But... You're a famous author.

49:48.585 --> 49:51.753
And you've been to prison.

49:57.794 --> 50:01.096
<i>Sir thomas malory wrote
le morte d'arthur.</i>

50:01.131 --> 50:05.000
When he was prison.
Did you know that?

50:05.035 --> 50:08.236
No, I didn't.

50:10.674 --> 50:13.308
So you're in good company.

50:13.343 --> 50:16.745
Though many scholars believe
that the charges...

50:19.149 --> 50:22.984
Levied against him...

50:23.020 --> 50:25.754
Were invented.

50:43.807 --> 50:45.607
What's wrong?

50:51.248 --> 50:52.981
I-I don't feel...
I don't feel well.

50:53.016 --> 50:53.815
All of a sudden.

50:53.850 --> 50:54.716
Sit, sit.

50:54.751 --> 50:56.751
No, it's okay.

50:57.854 --> 51:00.221
I-I'll show myself out.

53:18.462 --> 53:21.863
<i>Hi, you've reached
the voicemail of alison and...</i>

53:21.898 --> 53:23.098
<i>joanie. We can't get to.</i>

53:23.133 --> 53:24.165
<i>The phone right now,</i>

53:24.201 --> 53:25.800
<i>So just leave us a message,</i>

53:25.836 --> 53:27.469
<i>And we'll get back
as soon as we can.</i>

53:27.504 --> 53:29.337
<i>Thank you, and have a great day.</i>

53:31.007 --> 53:32.774
Hey, it's me. Um...

53:35.412 --> 53:38.546
I know you told me not to
contact you, but...

53:40.484 --> 53:42.617
But I, um...

53:42.652 --> 53:45.620
I just needed to
hear your voice, so...

53:50.660 --> 53:52.827
And now I have, so...

53:52.863 --> 53:54.562
So...
