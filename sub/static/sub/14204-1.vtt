<i>I met a woman.</i>

03:15.000 --> 03:17.207
<i>She said that she is Belfast,</i>

03:17.280 --> 03:19.851
<i>the city in Northern Ireland
where I grew up.</i>

03:22.520 --> 03:25.364
<i>The woman said that
she's as old as the city.</i>

03:26.560 --> 03:29.086
<i>As she talked, I got drawn in.</i>

03:29.280 --> 03:30.964
<i>She had a way of seeing,</i>

03:31.240 --> 03:33.242
<i>a way of talking and hoping.</i>

03:33.520 --> 03:35.409
<i>And, so, I listened.</i>

03:38.880 --> 03:40.644
<i>(BELFAST)
I'm glad you listened.</i>

03:40.920 --> 03:42.445
<i>You didn't have to.</i>

03:43.520 --> 03:45.284
<i>You've been away so long.</i>

03:46.000 --> 03:48.321
<i>I didn't need to
tell you my stories.</i>

03:49.120 --> 03:50.565

Oh, <i>I</i> know.

03:51.200 --> 03:52.690
<i>BELFAST}
You came back to Belfast,</i>

03:52.760 --> 03:55.286
<i>like so many
travelers went there.</i>

03:56.720 --> 03:58.927
<i>Belfast's</i> a <i>port,</i> a <i>harbor.</i>

03:59.120 --> 04:00.690
<i>We made the world's linen.</i>

04:00.960 --> 04:03.122
<i>And ships for the seven seas.</i>

04:09.320 --> 04:11.607
<i>(COUSINS) That's me,

<i>(BELFAST) You're</i> a

04:24.200 --> 04:26.680
<i>When I say that I am Belfast,</i>

04:27.040 --> 04:29.122
<i>I don't mean that I lived there,</i>

04:31.320 --> 04:33.209
<i>or feel that I'm the place.</i>

04:42.360 --> 04:44.089
<i>You come from Belfast,</i>

04:44.280 --> 04:45.406

04:45.640 --> 04:47.165
<i>My dream life?</i>

04:49.080 --> 04:51.162
<i>I've had quite a dream life.</i>

04:53.800 --> 04:55.723
<i>Can I tell you about it?</i>

04:57.240 --> 04:59.641
<i>(COUSINS)

<i>Where's this?</i>

06:13.160 --> 06:15.208
<i>Are we at the North Pole?</i>

06:15.960 --> 06:17.450
<i>Or in the clouds?</i>

06:17.600 --> 06:19.011
<i>Or on an ice planet?</i>

06:19.600 --> 06:21.568
<i>This place could sink a ship.</i>

06:52.400 --> 06:54.687

behind this hill.</i>

<i>BELFAST}
Your hands are cold.</i>

07:55.200 --> 07:57.248

15:05.800 --> 15:08.246

<i>workmen have left their
tin hut in front of it.</i>

16:23.000 --> 16:24.889
<i>The supervisors were men.</i>

16:25.800 --> 16:27.404

<i>An autumn riot.</i>

17:18.000 --> 17:20.685

17:57.800 --> 17:59.962
<i>Boy, do we put on a show!</i>

18:04.160 --> 18:05.764
<i>This is a proscenium.</i>

18:05.960 --> 18:07.291

I was very romantic, were you not?

54:49.840 --> 54:51.046
Course I fucking was!

54:51.120 --> 54:53.122
<i>(ROSE)
I walked from The Plaza,</i>

54:53.360 --> 54:57.570
up through Sandy Row, up the
Donegal Road, and into my house

54:57.640 --> 55:00.166
and people would have stood
at the door and said "hello" to me.

55:00.280 --> 55:04.968
We walked home with a crowd, half went
to Sandy Row, half went to the Botanic.

55:05.080 --> 55:07.845
All mixed religions, and
yet we all went out together.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.401
(MAUD) We did, like. There was
nothing bad in them fucking days.

55:10.520 --> 55:12.761
And the day I got married,
there was five people,

55:12.840 --> 55:15.650
four from the Shankill and two
from Sandy Row, at my wedding.

55:15.760 --> 55:17.762
(MAUD) Aye, and there
was nobody at mine.

55:18.080 --> 55:21.323
<i>Fuck, you didn't have a fucking
wedding, Maud. You weren't married!</i>

55:21.920 --> 55:24.127
I fucking know I wasn't married,
it was a common law marriage.

55:24.200 --> 55:25.804
It may as well have been
a fucking marriage

55:25.880 --> 55:27.848
because he beat the fucking
crap out of me anyway.

55:27.920 --> 55:30.321
- Did you not have a honeymoon?
- Yes, of course I did, yeah.

55:30.440 --> 55:32.124
Fine, you were
fucking married then.

55:32.240 --> 55:35.562
See I told you, fuck's sake.
Fucking hell, am I married?

55:37.120 --> 55:38.007
Fuck's sake.

55:38.200 --> 55:39.611
You know what I say to God?

55:39.640 --> 55:41.130
"Please forgive me."

55:41.280 --> 55:43.521
(ROSIE) For how many times
she said "fuck".

55:43.600 --> 55:45.204
I said "fuck" a couple of times.

55:45.320 --> 55:47.129
And here's me:
"Oh, God, I didn't mean that."

55:47.160 --> 55:48.571
Here's me:
"Forgive me."

55:48.640 --> 55:51.166
And then I just go
to fucking sleep afterwards.

55:51.560 --> 55:54.450
He probably knows
what I'm like anyway.

55:54.800 --> 55:57.531
The only thing we haven't lost
right now is our virginity.

55:57.640 --> 55:59.563
We've lost every ha'penny
we ever earned.

55:59.800 --> 56:01.689
Have you got yours, love?

56:01.800 --> 56:02.926
<i>(COUSINS)
Still intact.</i>

56:03.000 --> 56:04.604
- Oooooh!
- Have you? Fuck, that's great!

56:04.800 --> 56:06.131
Oh fuck, you'll do me lovely.

56:06.400 --> 56:09.085
Oh, here, fuck.
Isn't that great?

56:09.520 --> 56:11.887
C'mon over here, love. C'mon.

56:12.200 --> 56:15.010
It'll only take five minutes,
believe you me, we're quick!

56:15.200 --> 56:17.521
We don't need a cover or
anything, you know what I mean.

56:17.640 --> 56:20.928
No, well, when you hear of anything,
you can come and visit us half the day.

56:21.040 --> 56:23.884
Yes, uh-huh, you don't need
your umbrella on the day.

56:24.160 --> 56:25.161
C'mon, love.

56:25.520 --> 56:28.091
Ah, c'mon, for fuck's sake.
Stop teasing people.

56:28.400 --> 56:31.404
We're not that bad, you know what
I mean, love. We're not really.

56:31.960 --> 56:33.371
<i>(COUSINS)
Thelma and Louise.</i>

56:33.560 --> 56:35.289
<i>(BELFAST)
Exactly.</i>

56:36.360 --> 56:38.931
<i>Somebody should write
a country song.</i>

56:39.880 --> 56:44.090
<i>'The Ballad of Rosie and Maud:
A Catholic and a Protestant'.</i>

56:45.000 --> 56:47.128
<i>Tell me theirs isn't lovely talk.</i>

56:47.640 --> 56:49.642
<i>Tell me they aren't diamonds.</i>

56:53.600 --> 56:57.366
<i>I wish the rest of my story could
be full of diamonds, but it can't.</i>

57:01.000 --> 57:02.650
<i>When the storm cleared</i>

57:03.240 --> 57:05.129
<i>it also left something bad.</i>

57:05.600 --> 57:06.647
<i>Walls.</i>

57:07.000 --> 57:09.162
<i>Our Berlin Walls.</i>

57:10.360 --> 57:15.002
<i>Today, we've more walls keeping salt and
sweet apart than I can ever remember.</i>

57:15.560 --> 57:16.925
<i>Want to see them?</i>

57:17.280 --> 57:18.281
(COUSINS)
Yeah.

57:18.400 --> 57:19.401
<i>(BELFAST)
You sure?</i>

57:20.000 --> 57:21.240
<i>(COUSINS)
They're there aren't they?</i>

57:21.560 --> 57:22.800
(BELFAST)
Okay.

57:24.840 --> 57:26.365
<i>Here's one in the East.</i>

57:27.640 --> 57:29.642
<i>Triple height for full effect.</i>

57:30.960 --> 57:33.327
<i>Brick, then iron, then mesh.</i>

57:37.680 --> 57:41.924
<i>Then fluttering above it all,
the flag that the Unionists love.</i>

57:46.680 --> 57:49.365
<i>High enough to be seen
from the other side.</i>

57:50.280 --> 57:53.090
<i>For maximum annoyance and pride.</i>

57:58.760 --> 58:02.731
<i>And jump to here. To a Catholic
road. Or what used to be a road.</i>

58:06.600 --> 58:08.364
<i>Now it's a blind alley.</i>

58:08.920 --> 58:12.720
<i>Waves of salt and sweet
can crash against this peace wall,</i>

58:13.200 --> 58:15.601
<i>this sea wall covered in seaweed,</i>

58:16.000 --> 58:17.525
<i>but they don't get through.</i>

58:18.080 --> 58:21.243
<i>Five types of fence
in this one place alone.</i>

58:27.120 --> 58:30.249
<i>Walk up to the top of the street,
to this corner.</i>

58:33.560 --> 58:36.689
<i>The silver car turns
down the Catholic hill.</i>

58:37.800 --> 58:40.007
<i>The road to the left is Protestant.</i>

58:42.840 --> 58:45.366
<i>The house in the middle has
iron railings on its windows</i>

58:45.440 --> 58:47.727
<i>to stop them being
broken by bricks.</i>

58:54.640 --> 58:58.247
<i>Above the house, we can just
see the top of the peace line.</i>

58:59.360 --> 59:02.603
<i>The house to its left
has had white paint thrown at it.</i>

59:09.800 --> 59:11.404
<i>Look at the pavement.</i>

59:11.800 --> 59:15.009
<i>It goes from Catholic,
with no paint on its kerb,</i>

59:15.520 --> 59:18.808
<i>to red and white, the beginning
of the Protestant kerb.</i>

59:19.320 --> 59:20.924
<i>Fornenst each other.</i>

59:22.400 --> 59:27.361
<i>This split in me seems as
solid as concrete, as tarmac.</i>

59:31.040 --> 59:33.281
<i>I wish it were shadow play.</i>

59:37.880 --> 59:42.090
<i>I wish my walls had electric
shadows on them, or movies.</i>

59:44.840 --> 59:47.161
<i>Morning sun on cars commuting</i>

59:47.280 --> 59:49.567
<i>or speeding to the
Mourne mountains,</i>

59:49.960 --> 59:52.531
<i>so that their drivers can
walk and sing in the mountains</i>

59:52.600 --> 59:55.365
<i>like Julie Andrews or Ruby Murray.</i>

59:59.400 --> 01:00:01.641
<i>I wish my walls grew things.</i>

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:08.043
<i>I wish those things -ivy, wall
flowers -would break open the walls.</i>

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:14.044
<i>I wish our walls were gold.</i>

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.370
<i>Like Johnny Cash,</i>

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:56.166
<i>to end this trip</i>

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.251
<i>I walk the line.</i>

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.770
<i>A yellow brick road.</i>

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:05.370
<i>Autumn's lines.</i>

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:10.250
<i>A thin blue line.</i>

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.648
<i>Sometimes there's a lovely line.</i>

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:17.685
<i>Like this, down by the docks.</i>

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:20.882
<i>A snail's silver trail.</i>

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:24.291
<i>Its morse code
took it to the road</i>

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.442
<i>and then back home, safe.</i>

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:33.404
<i>How often will I walk this town?</i>

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.402
<i>For how many more years?</i>

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:39.725
<i>Will I always have to
walk straight lines?</i>

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:42.804
<i>(COUSINS)
Berlin Wall's down.</i>

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:45.048
<i>Our walls need to come down.</i>

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:47.051
<i>(BELFAST)
Or just blur.</i>

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.406
<i>Blurring's good.</i>

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:50.888
<i>It means something
different here.</i>

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:53.566
<i>Sometimes we've been
great at blurred lines.</i>

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:55.682
<i>At being two things at once.</i>

01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:00.050
<i>Before your time,
one of our comedians,</i>

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:03.647
<i>James Young, was a man
but played a woman.</i>

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.802
<i>I can still see his sketches.</i>

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:09.089
<i>Like the one about why we would
never go on holidays abroad...</i>

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:13.205
Yes, we never go abroad.
I wouldn't be bothered with that

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:17.968
because my maw has
a wee cottage at Bally-Go-Bent.

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:19.769
It's down on the coast road.

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:22.280
And we would go
down there of a set time.

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:25.688
My man always takes the twelfth
fortnight because the factory

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:28.923
he works at night closes down
for the twelfth fortnight.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.241
And he hasn't been well
hisself all winter.

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:32.521
My nerves are away to bits.

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:35.251
I underwent a
very serious operation.

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:38.250
And he always takes the twelfth
fortnight. So I said to him,

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:41.802
"Tommy," I says, "this year,"
I says, "just take three weeks."

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:45.362
He says, "'l will not, indeed," he says,
"because if I took an extra week

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:48.683
"and the place was open they would
find out that I do nothing anyway

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:50.728
"and I might have no job left."

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:55.608
It's awful what people have to
go through, twelfth week and all.

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:03.761
<i>And even some of our
hard men blurred lines</i>

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:06.247
<i>by having a
touch of girl about them.</i>

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:11.646
<i>One member of the Ulster
Defence Association,</i>

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:12.846
<i>Sammy Duddy,</i>

a <i>drag artist and
the Dolly Parton of Belfast.</i>

<i>On one attempt to
murder him, he escaped,</i>

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:29.247
<i>but his pet Chihuahua,
Bambi, was killed instead.</i>

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:34.768
<i>And what about
Lord Arthur Chichester,</i>

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:37.411
<i>who sort of
founded me, Belfast?</i>

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:41.043
<i>Or so the history books say,
in the 1600s.</i>

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:43.005
<i>Look at his eyebrows!</i>

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:45.841
<i>Marlene Dietrich eyebrows.</i>

<i>They should all merge.</i>

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.002
<i>That's what I want to say to you.</i>

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.410
<i>Don't just look at Belfast,

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:08.971
<i>Me!</i>

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:13.641
<i>That's what the painter
of this mural did.</i>

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:15.964
<i>It's a dreamscape.</i>

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:47.887
<i>The Giant's Causeway, on the left.</i>

<i>The real world,

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:58.648
<i>And then this man in blue.</i>

01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:05.282
<i>The things his eyes have seen.</i>

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:10.882
<i>Has he cataracts now?</i>

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:17.731
<i>Maybe cataracts come
if you see too much.</i>

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:21.530
<i>Eyes cloud over.</i>

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.367
<i>He's old enough to have
worked in the docks.</i>

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:33.648
<i>Can you imagine
what it's like to be him?</i>

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:37.083
<i>What would be
his favourite song?</i>

01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:39.448
<i>"Chantily lace with a pretty face"?</i>

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:43.561
<i>Has he gout from too much booze?</i>
