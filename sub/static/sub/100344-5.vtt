the strangulation murder

39:28.589 --> 39:31.089
of their mother after the police
had closed the case.

39:31.172 --> 39:33.297
Uh, her money was gone,
her jewelry was gone,

39:33.381 --> 39:35.422
she lived in a crap neighborhood
so, uh,

39:35.506 --> 39:37.923

local junkies.

39:41.422 --> 39:45.172
she was found laying face up,
with a pillow under her head

39:45.255 --> 39:47.047
and a washcloth over her eyes.

39:47.130 --> 39:49.381
-Which said to me, that--
-That whoever killed her

39:49.464 --> 39:51.214
had a strong sense
of remorse.

39:51.297 --> 39:54.089
They tried to make
her comfortable afterwards,

39:54.172 --> 39:55.964
and the washcloth
over the eyes...

39:56.047 --> 39:58.130
Tells me that he was afraid
to see the disappointment

this was maybe someone, uh...
