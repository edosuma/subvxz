00:06.005 --> 00:07.547
Kate: Previously on
"Workin' Moms".

00:07.547 --> 00:10.047
- Mommy, you're bleeding.
- Shit.

00:10.047 --> 00:12.255
Frankie: What a waste
of my goddamn time.

00:12.255 --> 00:14.213
Do you think I liked
driving you around,

00:14.213 --> 00:16.255
with your Hermes cologne?

00:16.255 --> 00:17.922
- Frankie, there have been
a few complaints.

00:17.922 --> 00:19.380
- So you're officially on bed
rest.

00:19.380 --> 00:20.422
- I don't do bed rest.

00:20.422 --> 00:21.963
(Engine revs, car crashes)

00:23.588 --> 00:25.213
- Sometimes you gotta
do something crazy

00:25.213 --> 00:26.672
to remember who you are.

00:26.672 --> 00:28.713
- Stop bragging and pierce
my goddamn nipple.

00:28.713 --> 00:29.838
(Pained wince)

00:29.838 --> 00:31.880
I think I need to leave
my husband.

00:36.380 --> 00:38.547
(Babies coo)

00:38.547 --> 00:40.630
- The stork is taking you
to Montreal.

00:40.630 --> 00:43.588
- Thank you, Val,
it's very... sweet.

00:44.588 --> 00:47.213
Anne: What's sweet?
I can't see anything.

00:47.213 --> 00:48.838
- How's it going over there,
Annie?

00:48.838 --> 00:50.463
- What's wrong with Anne?

00:50.463 --> 00:52.755
- Uh, she's like bleeding,
she's on bed rest.

00:52.755 --> 00:54.297
- My ass is numb, I smell weird

00:54.297 --> 00:55.838
and my brain is reeling.

00:55.838 --> 00:58.213
God, not having clients
really sucks.

00:58.213 --> 01:00.005
Like I thought about what
I'm having for lunch today

01:00.005 --> 01:03.422
four times -
tuna fish sandwich. Wait...

01:04.547 --> 01:06.838
- Hang in there, mama.
It's only temporary.

01:06.838 --> 01:09.505
Anne: Yeah, temporarily
ruining my life.

01:09.505 --> 01:12.422
I gotta say guys, I'm seriously
considering an abortion.

01:13.963 --> 01:15.630
Crap, did this thing freeze?

01:15.630 --> 01:17.630
- Oh, no, we're still here,
Anne.

01:17.630 --> 01:19.588
- Just it sounded like you said

01:19.588 --> 01:21.463
you were thinking
about an abortion.

01:21.463 --> 01:23.422
- Uh, yeah,
that's 'cause I did.

01:23.422 --> 01:25.380
- I think we're all
just a little taken back.

01:25.380 --> 01:27.880
- Well, I don't get it,
it's only another six months?

01:27.880 --> 01:29.797
I mean, I was on bed rest
my last pregnancy

01:29.797 --> 01:31.672
and I kind of enjoyed it.

01:31.672 --> 01:33.213
- Aren't you a dream?

01:33.213 --> 01:35.297
Anne: The thing is, it's
not just another six months.

01:35.297 --> 01:37.797
It's the fact that our money
is tied up in God knows what;

01:37.797 --> 01:39.380
Lionel, while adorable,

01:39.380 --> 01:41.922
is about as predictable
as a baby boy's pee stream,

01:41.922 --> 01:43.797
and frankly, sometimes it feels
like this pregnancy

01:43.797 --> 01:46.172
might be killing me.
Hey, I'm sorry, Kate,

01:46.172 --> 01:47.922
this day is supposed
to be about you.

01:47.922 --> 01:50.630
- Yes, Kate! I'd love
to change the subject.

01:50.630 --> 01:53.047
Let's talk about this new
job of yours.

01:53.047 --> 01:57.047
- Oh. Well, I'll be handling
the largest account at Gaze,

01:57.047 --> 01:59.255
so it's kind of a big deal.

01:59.255 --> 02:02.213
- Wow. Woo, this is more fun
to talk about!

02:02.213 --> 02:05.630
You know what won't be fun?
Mommy and Me without you.

02:05.630 --> 02:07.797
- Sorry, you just go
to Montreal

02:07.797 --> 02:09.588
for training or something?

02:09.588 --> 02:11.255
- Uh, no, it's a total
re-brand,

02:11.255 --> 02:14.172
the job would take place there.
- For how long?

02:14.172 --> 02:16.297
- Three months.
- Three months?!

02:16.297 --> 02:19.838
Wow, uh... isn't that
like a six hour drive?

02:19.838 --> 02:22.005
- Or a one hour flight.
Anne: Alicia, I'm sorry,

02:22.005 --> 02:24.422
doesn't your husband work
in Alaska half the year?

02:24.422 --> 02:26.588
- Yeah, so?
- So?

02:26.588 --> 02:28.547
- So it's different
because he's a--

02:28.547 --> 02:31.338
- Because he's a what, a he?

02:31.338 --> 02:33.005
- Busted!
- Uh-uh.

02:33.005 --> 02:35.838
Anne: Yes!
In your face, Alicia!

02:35.838 --> 02:39.463
Yeah. It's raining me!
Yeah!

02:39.463 --> 02:41.588

appreciate business casual.

02:55.213 --> 02:57.463

What did you just say to me?

03:38.547 --> 03:42.547

It's a get-better card.

03:58.172 --> 04:00.630
And he's so brown and blobby.

04:01.630 --> 04:03.297

04:39.797 --> 04:41.630
She loves me.

04:41.630 --> 04:44.255
I'm the worst.
- Who, Alice?

04:44.255 --> 04:46.505
That's great. Why do you
sound traumatized?

04:46.505 --> 04:48.755

maybe we are connected.

04:48.755 --> 04:50.505
You know, just in our own
fucked up way.

04:50.505 --> 04:52.755

Why aren't you happy?

04:52.755 --> 04:54.255
I'm thrilled for you.

05:04.630 --> 05:06.172
I'll see you soon.

05:13.422 --> 05:15.338
- What are you doing,
fondling yourself?

05:15.338 --> 05:18.963
- No, it's this nipple ring.
Still hurts.

05:18.963 --> 05:20.797
- Then why don't you
take it out?

05:20.797 --> 05:22.338
- No.

05:22.338 --> 05:24.755
It's like the one part of me
that's not a wife and a mother.

05:24.755 --> 05:27.463
- Gross.
What are you doing tonight?

05:27.463 --> 05:30.130
- I don't know,
being a wife and a mother?

05:30.130 --> 05:32.088
- I'm going to The Silver
Dollar Room.

05:32.088 --> 05:34.213
They have extra cheap
drink specials,

05:34.213 --> 05:35.963
and they have these
underemployed hipsters

05:35.963 --> 05:37.255

You wanna come?

05:53.130 --> 05:55.005
- Calm down.
I can't understand you.

05:55.005 --> 05:57.005
- I have a meeting
with a producer

05:57.005 --> 05:59.172
who's interested
in "Father Daze"!

05:59.172 --> 06:01.297

06:05.380 --> 06:08.338

Why you dumping on this?

06:08.338 --> 06:11.838
- I'm not. I'm sorry.
That's... that's great.

- Hey, let's celebrate
tonight - you and me.

06:14.088 --> 06:16.255
I'll order Swiss Chalet
and we can slow-bone

06:16.255 --> 06:17.713

06:21.713 --> 06:23.505
Ian: What? Why?

06:23.505 --> 06:26.963

It's a charity event

06:32.297 --> 06:34.713
Well, you know what?
That's okay, it's, uh,

06:34.713 --> 06:36.755
it's good material

- I'm serious.

08:19.047 --> 08:21.213
- Really? Like, really?

08:21.213 --> 08:23.088
- Get your eyes on the road.

08:23.088 --> 08:25.213
Look, I just wanna go to see
how I feel when I get there,

08:25.213 --> 08:28.047
okay? Please.

08:30.213 --> 08:32.630
- Okay, I will take you
to an abortion clinic,

08:32.630 --> 08:34.838
but this is a sight seeing
mission only.

08:34.838 --> 08:36.547
- Yup.
- All right.

08:36.547 --> 08:38.172
- You are gonna need
to start driving faster,

08:38.172 --> 08:39.672
it feels like we're
moving backwards.

08:39.672 --> 08:41.213
- You shouldn't even be
out of the house, okay?

08:41.213 --> 08:42.630
I'm taking it slow.

08:42.630 --> 08:44.547
- I would like to get there
before I have this baby.

08:44.547 --> 08:46.172
- Okay, so where is this place,
anyway?

08:46.172 --> 08:48.088
- I don't know. Why do you
think I would know that?

08:48.088 --> 08:49.630
- Because you asked
to go to one.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.255
- Yeah, but I've never actually
been to one.

08:51.255 --> 08:52.797
Have you been to one?
- No.

08:52.797 --> 08:54.005
- You know what?
I'll just Yelp one.

08:54.005 --> 08:55.755
- You're gonna Yelp
an abortion clinic?

08:55.755 --> 08:57.213
- Yeah, of course.
- I guess you're right,

08:57.213 --> 08:59.047
you can sorta review anything,
right?

08:59.047 --> 09:01.838

an abortion clinic gets though.

09:01.838 --> 09:03.880
Like, one star!
Still pregnant!

09:03.880 --> 09:06.213
- That's sick, Kate.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.047
Should I sort it by rating
or distance?

09:08.047 --> 09:09.338
- Rating, obviously!

09:09.338 --> 09:11.130
- I just didn't want us
to get stuck in traffic

09:11.130 --> 09:12.797
on the way there.
- Hm, that's a good point.

09:12.797 --> 09:14.672
- (Grunts with effort)

09:15.922 --> 09:18.047
(Relaxed breath)

09:25.297 --> 09:27.255
"By acknowledging
an item's contribution

09:27.255 --> 09:28.797
and letting it go
with gratitude,

09:28.797 --> 09:30.838
you'll be able to truly
put the things you own,

09:30.838 --> 09:33.338
and your life, in order.

09:33.338 --> 09:35.172
Huh?

09:37.047 --> 09:41.505
Well, I wanna thank you
for working these long hours,

09:41.505 --> 09:44.297
even when we weren't home.

09:46.088 --> 09:47.922
- Hey, Frankie.

09:47.922 --> 09:50.755
You giving all this stuff away?

09:50.755 --> 09:53.380
- Marie Kondo says it's the
only way to domestic purity,

09:53.380 --> 09:55.630
so... yeah.
- Okay, but...

09:56.880 --> 10:00.588
I mean, you could probably get
$200 online for the Roomba.

10:00.588 --> 10:02.797
I'm just sayin'.

10:02.797 --> 10:04.963
Happy Wednesday.

10:10.630 --> 10:11.838
(Footsteps thud)

10:14.922 --> 10:17.172
- Hi. I'd like an abortion.
- Anne!

10:17.172 --> 10:19.588
What the hell,
not what we agreed on.

10:19.588 --> 10:22.047
- I agreed to nothing.
- You can both relax

10:22.047 --> 10:23.838
because you're not getting
an abortion today.

10:23.838 --> 10:25.172
- Why not?

10:25.172 --> 10:27.338
- You can't just walk in here
and order one.

10:27.338 --> 10:29.005
- But this is Canada.

10:29.005 --> 10:30.838
- I can book you in
for a consultation.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.838
- Fine. Anything that gets me
one step closer

10:32.838 --> 10:35.338
to not being pregnant. Good.

10:35.338 --> 10:37.380
- So...
hi, quick thing,

10:38.672 --> 10:41.213
can I bring this in here?

10:46.338 --> 10:49.172
(Cars whoosh by outside)

10:50.380 --> 10:53.547
(Charlie coos)

10:53.547 --> 10:55.672
He's not usually this happy.

10:55.672 --> 10:57.838
What time did they say they
would-- how long?

10:57.838 --> 11:00.047
(Coffee pours)

11:01.338 --> 11:03.255
(Heavy sighs)

11:05.422 --> 11:07.005
- Hey.
Jenny: Hmm.

11:07.005 --> 11:10.255
- Do you wanna cut out early?
We can go by the L-CEEB,

11:10.255 --> 11:12.755
and then go to my place,
start getting ready.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.505
- Won't we get in trouble
for that?

11:14.505 --> 11:16.463
- Well...

11:16.463 --> 11:18.713
Marv, we're gonna skip out
early.

11:18.713 --> 11:20.755
Is that cool?
- Mm-hmm.

11:20.755 --> 11:23.213
- Didn't you want some coffee?

11:23.213 --> 11:25.213
- No.

11:26.547 --> 11:28.672
- Let's do it.
- All right!

11:28.672 --> 11:30.380
We can grab some condoms
on the way.

11:30.380 --> 11:32.422
- Oh my God. Stop it.
I don't need condoms.

11:32.422 --> 11:35.088
But it might feel freeing to
just like have them in my purse.

11:37.338 --> 11:39.255
- So this is where
it all happens.

11:39.255 --> 11:41.547
- Uh-ha. Oh.

11:41.547 --> 11:44.297
- Okay, so...

11:44.297 --> 11:47.922
who am I speaking with today?
- Me.

11:47.922 --> 11:49.505
- And are you the partner?

11:49.505 --> 11:52.047
- (Laughs) No.
I'm just here to watch?

11:52.047 --> 11:54.213
What?
- Okay?

11:54.213 --> 11:56.963
So, Ms. Carlson, you are
thinking of having an abortion?

11:56.963 --> 11:58.297
- Yeah, I am.

11:58.297 --> 12:00.130
That sounds really weird
when you say it like that.

12:00.130 --> 12:02.797
Um, is this the room
that it happens in?

12:02.797 --> 12:04.547
- Sometimes, yes.

12:04.547 --> 12:06.255
The procedure has been
performed in this room.

12:06.255 --> 12:08.463
- Really.
- Yup.

12:08.463 --> 12:10.213
It's kinda cold in here,
you know?

12:10.213 --> 12:13.463
Not temperature wise,
but atmosphere's kinda weird.

12:13.463 --> 12:15.755
Be nice if you could
light some candles.

12:15.755 --> 12:18.088
- That might be dangerous.
- Yeah, but comforting, right?

12:18.088 --> 12:19.838
- When was your last period?

12:19.838 --> 12:21.297
- Does anybody know
the answer to that?

12:21.297 --> 12:23.505
- Do you know your due date?
- Off the top of my head?!

12:23.505 --> 12:25.505
- Anne, take a breath.
- I said, I don't know!

12:28.255 --> 12:29.547
- Where are you going?

12:29.547 --> 12:31.297
- I think I left the car
running.

12:31.297 --> 12:32.588
- I drove.

12:36.005 --> 12:37.630
Dude, are you okay?!

12:38.797 --> 12:40.630
- Why would they make
that place, so like...

12:40.630 --> 12:43.547
so clinical like that?
- Well, it is a clinic.

12:43.547 --> 12:45.755
- And that lighting? What is
with that lighting in there?

12:45.755 --> 12:47.672
- Probably standard lighting
for medical procedures.

12:47.672 --> 12:49.088
- Why are you fighting me
on this?

12:49.088 --> 12:51.922
Did you not see how cold
and sterile that place was?

12:51.922 --> 12:54.422
- Of course I did!
But Anne, what do you expect?

12:54.422 --> 12:56.130
Their job isn't to seduce you
into buying a procedure.

12:56.130 --> 12:59.088
They're not a day spa.

12:59.088 --> 13:02.005
What they're doing in there
is serious. Right?

13:02.005 --> 13:05.338
And if it felt wrong,
then it's good you now know.

13:05.338 --> 13:08.963
- But that's the thing, is that
it didn't feel all that wrong.

13:10.172 --> 13:12.755
It just felt wrong that Lionel
wasn't there, you know?

13:12.755 --> 13:14.463
- Yeah. I get that.

13:14.463 --> 13:16.422
Look, keeping a secret
from your husband

13:16.422 --> 13:18.838
is nowhere near as fun
as it sounds.

13:18.838 --> 13:21.880
- Can you just take me home?
- Yes. Come on.

13:23.380 --> 13:25.213
- You have to at least go
the speed limit this time.

13:25.213 --> 13:26.880
- That's a hard "no".

13:26.880 --> 13:29.088
(Door opens, Gisele sighs)
- Mmm.

13:30.338 --> 13:32.838
- It smells great in here!

13:32.838 --> 13:35.172
- Mmm. Yeah, it's a peasant
stew.

13:35.172 --> 13:37.380
- Ah. (Laughs)

13:39.297 --> 13:40.505
Mmm.

13:41.797 --> 13:43.588
You cleaned.

13:43.588 --> 13:44.922
Frankie: Yeah, a bit.

13:44.922 --> 13:46.838
Ooh, that book you sent?

13:46.838 --> 13:49.630
- I thought it would be a good
project for you to focus on.

13:49.630 --> 13:51.547
Frankie: Mm-hmm. Yes!

13:52.547 --> 13:53.797
- What's up?

13:53.797 --> 13:56.297
- I just got 250 bones
for the ottoman.

13:56.297 --> 13:58.880
- Your grandmother's ottoman?
But you love that thing.

13:58.880 --> 14:01.088
- Yeah, but the book says
that if an item

14:01.088 --> 14:03.172
no longer brings you joy you're
supposed to like thank it,

14:03.172 --> 14:06.922
and send it on its way.
To somebody who'll pay for it.

14:06.922 --> 14:08.797
- I don't think that
was the point of the book,

14:08.797 --> 14:11.380
but $250 s is wonderful.
We could use that.

14:11.380 --> 14:13.422
- Yeah, just think about all
the junk in our house, right.

14:13.422 --> 14:16.213
Like all the books and diaries,
and jackets.

14:16.213 --> 14:18.047
- Who would want to buy
your diaries?

14:18.047 --> 14:19.505
- People will buy
just about anything

14:19.505 --> 14:21.630
if you put the right...
spin on it.

14:29.338 --> 14:31.338
- Sweetie, that is really,
really good.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.255
Um, quick question:

14:33.255 --> 14:36.088
why does my upper body look
kinda like a big brown pile?

14:36.088 --> 14:38.255
- 'Cause that's what you
look like in the morning.

14:38.255 --> 14:41.005
- Okay. Yeah,
like a big pile of shit.

14:41.005 --> 14:43.672
Poo. Don't say that word.
It's really good, sweetie.

14:43.672 --> 14:44.672
(Door opens)

14:47.630 --> 14:49.213
Where have you girls been?

14:49.213 --> 14:50.547
- Yeah, call me later.

14:50.547 --> 14:53.005
- Bye.

14:54.255 --> 14:56.380
- Anne?
- I'm sorry, Lionel.

14:56.380 --> 14:57.963
- Hey, not only are you
not in bed,

14:57.963 --> 15:00.005
where you are medically
prescribed to be,

15:00.005 --> 15:01.922
but apparently, now you're not
answering your phone.

15:01.922 --> 15:03.963
- Okay, Lionel, you're right.
I-I'm sorry.

15:03.963 --> 15:08.047
That was not cool of me.
- Where in the "F" where you?

15:11.005 --> 15:12.672
Sweetie, could you do me
a favor, please?

15:12.672 --> 15:15.713
- For five dollars.
- Get upstairs now!

15:15.713 --> 15:18.130
- It's okay, it's okay,
It's okay. Hey, shh.

15:23.422 --> 15:25.963
Okay, what's going on?

15:25.963 --> 15:28.755
Did you go to the new Costco
without me?

15:28.755 --> 15:31.630
- I had Kate take me
to an abortion clinic.

15:31.630 --> 15:34.005
- You what?
- I didn't do it!

15:34.005 --> 15:36.213
I-I just wanted to see
how I felt when I was there.

15:36.213 --> 15:38.380
- We-we already talked
about this though.

15:38.380 --> 15:40.380
I mean, this is something
we've gone over.

15:40.380 --> 15:43.005
- Yeah, we did talk about it.

15:43.005 --> 15:47.505
Lionel, this pregnancy
has been terrible for me.

15:47.505 --> 15:49.172
- (Exasperated huff)

15:49.172 --> 15:51.713
- Are you even listening
to anything that I'm saying?

15:51.713 --> 15:53.755
- You know, I'm sorry, I'm just
too busy getting over the fact

15:53.755 --> 15:56.713
that you went to an abortion
clinic without me.

15:56.713 --> 15:59.338
- I didn't have the abortion.
I...

15:59.338 --> 16:01.172
I just don't know
if we can take another kid.

16:01.172 --> 16:03.672
- You don't?

16:03.672 --> 16:05.755
- I'm sure we could handle it,
I just...

16:05.755 --> 16:09.547
I don't know if I want
that for us.

16:11.213 --> 16:13.005
Are you telling me that you've
never thought about this?

16:13.005 --> 16:15.088
It hasn't even crossed
your mind once?

16:15.088 --> 16:17.130
- Sure it has,
but you know what?

16:17.130 --> 16:20.505
I'm not off going to abortion
clinics to see how it feels.

16:20.505 --> 16:23.463
- Okay. So you do kind of
get it?

16:23.463 --> 16:25.422
- Does it even matter to you
if I do?

16:25.422 --> 16:27.630
- Come on, Lionel,
of course it matters.

16:27.630 --> 16:30.630
I need your help here, I need
to know what you wanna do.

16:30.630 --> 16:33.713
- It's good to know you care
so much about what I think.

16:35.338 --> 16:36.880
