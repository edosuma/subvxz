01:40.553 --> 01:42.930
What the...? What the fuck?

01:46.809 --> 01:48.227
What the...?

01:49.562 --> 01:51.480
What the fuck!

01:51.648 --> 01:52.940
Fuck.

01:54.901 --> 01:56.360
Hello?

01:57.654 --> 01:59.238
Fuck.

02:06.204 --> 02:07.246
Hello, Seth.

02:08.455 --> 02:09.789
I wanna play a game.

02:09.958 --> 02:12.167
Right now, you're feeling helpless.

02:12.335 --> 02:14.169
- This is the same helplessness...
- Help!

02:14.337 --> 02:16.296
...you've bestowed onto others.

02:16.464 --> 02:18.507
But now it's onto you.

02:18.675 --> 02:22.511
Some call this karma. I call it justice.

02:22.679 --> 02:24.680
Now, you served five years...

02:24.847 --> 02:27.849
...of what should have been
a life sentence for murder.

02:28.017 --> 02:30.143
A technicality gave you freedom...

02:30.311 --> 02:35.357
...but it inhibited you from understanding
the impact of taking a life.

02:35.525 --> 02:38.527
Today, I offer you true freedom.

02:38.695 --> 02:44.283
In 30 seconds, the pendulum will drop
far enough to touch your body.

02:44.450 --> 02:48.787
Within sixty seconds
it will cut you in half.

02:49.455 --> 02:54.876
To avoid the pendulum, all you have to do
is destroy the things that have killed:

02:55.044 --> 02:56.712
Your hands.

02:56.879 --> 02:58.547
You must insert your hands...

02:58.715 --> 03:01.883
...and push the buttons
to start the devices before you.

03:02.051 --> 03:04.678
Your bones will be crushed to dust.

03:04.846 --> 03:08.890
Will you destroy the things that have
taken life in order to save one, Seth?

03:09.058 --> 03:10.225
Make your choice.

03:13.730 --> 03:15.230
No.

03:38.671 --> 03:40.839
It was an accident!

03:46.512 --> 03:48.055
Please.

03:54.520 --> 03:55.604
Okay. Fuck you.

04:09.035 --> 04:11.953
Okay. Okay. Okay.

05:38.374 --> 05:40.959
I did what I was supposed to do.

06:09.739 --> 06:12.199
Let me see your hands.
Let me see your fucking hands.

06:12.366 --> 06:13.992
Where is my daughter? You...

06:24.754 --> 06:26.254
Jesus.

07:50.631 --> 07:52.340
Hello, Agent Strahm.

07:52.508 --> 07:56.344
If you're hearing this, then you've
finally found what you've been looking for.

07:56.512 --> 08:00.015
But is the discovery
of my body enough?

08:00.182 --> 08:06.396
Or will your insatiable hunger to uncover
the truth push you deeper into the abyss?

08:06.564 --> 08:10.025
Heed my warning: Do not proceed.

08:10.192 --> 08:15.864
For this room can either be
your sanctuary or it can be your grave.

08:16.365 --> 08:18.158
The choice is yours.

08:20.995 --> 08:22.162
Fuck you.

09:28.312 --> 09:29.938
Hey!

09:30.731 --> 09:56.214
Help!

11:21.509 --> 11:23.551
Go! Go!

11:25.888 --> 11:27.430
You're okay.

11:34.104 --> 11:35.897
- Where's my dad?
- He's gonna be okay.

11:36.065 --> 11:38.733
Where's my mom?
Where's my mom?

11:38.901 --> 11:42.070
Hoffman.
I got it. I got it.

11:43.739 --> 11:45.406
You okay to walk?

11:45.574 --> 11:47.742
What the hell, man?
What happened? Where's Rigg?

11:49.328 --> 11:52.622
Tried to help. He didn't make it.

11:53.207 --> 11:54.916
Nobody made it.

11:55.793 --> 11:57.710
We got a live one.

12:38.294 --> 12:39.544
Hello?

12:39.962 --> 12:41.254
Right away.

12:41.630 --> 12:43.214
Ms. Tuck.

12:43.549 --> 12:45.008
Have a seat.

12:48.971 --> 12:51.347
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Feldman.

12:52.474 --> 12:53.641
Why am I here?

12:54.184 --> 12:56.394
I represent your ex-husband, John.

12:56.562 --> 13:00.940
In the event of his death,
I was instructed to contact you.

13:01.108 --> 13:05.987
You can understand my surprise
when I found out who he really was.

13:06.155 --> 13:08.323
John left something for you.

13:30.512 --> 13:34.891
If you're watching this, Jill,
I'm long gone from this world.

13:35.851 --> 13:41.189
You are my heart, you always have been.
You always will be.

13:42.358 --> 13:47.779
I'm not going to try to explain
my actions of late.

13:47.947 --> 13:52.283
Suffice it to say that I find it difficult
to forgive myself...

13:52.451 --> 13:54.118
...for what happened at the clinic.

13:54.828 --> 14:01.000
I permitted, indeed, encouraged
your decisions regarding the people there.

14:01.502 --> 14:05.546
I saw danger and I...
I should have acted sooner.

14:05.714 --> 14:11.886
I'm leaving you a box today,
and its contents are of grave importance.

14:12.471 --> 14:15.974
Even though you and I don't always see
eye to eye on everything...

14:16.141 --> 14:19.644
...I deeply believe in you
and I believe that you will know...

14:19.812 --> 14:22.230
...what to do with these materials.

15:23.667 --> 15:26.461
I wanna thank you all
for coming here today.

15:26.628 --> 15:28.713
And I'd like to be the first to say...

15:28.881 --> 15:31.883
...that the Jigsaw murders are over.

15:33.677 --> 15:37.472
The officers who gave their lives
are being honored here today.

15:37.931 --> 15:40.975
But today I'd like to offer
a special honor...

15:41.143 --> 15:44.562
...to the detective who's been on this case
right from the beginning...

15:44.730 --> 15:48.399
...who proved through hard work
and dedication...

15:48.567 --> 15:51.819
...that the people who died
did not die in vain.

15:51.987 --> 15:56.324
Today we honor the newly promoted
Detective Lieutenant...

15:56.492 --> 15:58.618
...Mark Hoffman.

15:58.786 --> 16:00.328
Congratulations.

16:00.496 --> 16:02.330
Thank you so much.

16:10.839 --> 16:12.465
Thank you. Thank you very much.

16:13.008 --> 16:14.842
Uh, ahem...

16:15.636 --> 16:19.680
Throughout this ordeal,
if we've learned anything it's that...

16:19.848 --> 16:21.682
...human life is sacred.

16:22.518 --> 16:25.603
And we've learned that every day...

16:26.772 --> 16:28.940
...life should be cherished.

16:29.775 --> 16:31.484
Justice...

16:31.652 --> 16:35.738
...is the backbone
to every peaceful society.

16:36.949 --> 16:40.159
And I believe that true justice
has been served.

17:45.767 --> 17:48.227
Detective Hoffman,
you're wanted at the hospital.

17:48.395 --> 17:49.937
It's about Agent Perez.

17:50.105 --> 17:51.856
Thank you.

17:55.527 --> 18:01.324
Hello, Agent Perez, and welcome
to the world that you have long studied.

18:01.491 --> 18:03.534
Heed my warning, Agent Perez.

18:03.702 --> 18:06.829
Your next move is critical.

18:06.997 --> 18:08.831
- Open the door.
What is that?

18:14.129 --> 18:15.796
I got you.

18:37.486 --> 18:40.655
I'm truly sorry about Agent Perez.

18:42.741 --> 18:44.909
She said your name, you know.

18:45.827 --> 18:48.537
The last thing she said
was "Detective Hoffman. "

18:48.705 --> 18:51.999
Why'd she say that?
Why'd she say your name?

18:52.167 --> 18:54.377
- I don't know.
- No?

18:55.170 --> 18:57.630
How'd you walk out of that building?

18:57.798 --> 18:59.257
How did you?

18:59.424 --> 19:02.009
On a gurney with a fucking hole
in my throat.

19:04.513 --> 19:05.638
Look at you.

19:06.014 --> 19:09.016
Couple of scratches and a story
about how your arm straps broke.

19:09.184 --> 19:10.977
Jigsaw doesn't make mistakes.

19:11.144 --> 19:13.771
Is this you theorizing again?
Because Jigsaw's dead.

19:13.939 --> 19:17.817
I'm not talking about him, I'm talking about
you and your whole crooked department.

19:17.985 --> 19:21.028
My department's gone. They're all dead.
There's no one left.

19:21.196 --> 19:22.780
Besides you.

19:23.657 --> 19:26.659
Been chasing Jigsaw
from the beginning...

19:26.827 --> 19:28.744
...and I got him.

19:28.912 --> 19:30.997
So unless you've got
something else to say...

19:31.707 --> 19:33.874
...back the fuck off.

19:35.502 --> 19:37.962
Read the papers.
I saved that little girl.

19:54.021 --> 19:56.063
Sorry about Agent Perez.

19:57.107 --> 19:59.150
Shouldn't you be resting?

20:00.068 --> 20:01.944
I'm fine, Erickson.

20:02.112 --> 20:05.531
No, you're not, Peter.
That's why I put you on medical leave.

20:08.910 --> 20:11.203
I was supposed to die in that trap.

20:11.788 --> 20:14.373
You never should have been there
without backup.

20:14.541 --> 20:17.335
I wanna talk to Jill Tuck one last time.

20:18.503 --> 20:21.130
You're no longer handling
the case, Peter.

20:21.757 --> 20:23.174
What?

20:23.342 --> 20:24.759
Read it.

20:27.763 --> 20:31.349
Over a dozen dead bodies were recovered
at the scene, two of which were cops.

20:31.516 --> 20:35.102
Jigsaw's dead, how many lives
did I inevitably save?

20:35.270 --> 20:37.438
By endangering yourself and others.

20:37.606 --> 20:38.773
You're off the case.

20:38.940 --> 20:40.733
On whose orders?

20:40.901 --> 20:42.318
Mine.

20:43.779 --> 20:46.238
I'm sorry, Peter. It's over.

22:25.547 --> 22:26.881
Oh, my God.

22:31.178 --> 22:32.470
Oh...

22:32.804 --> 22:35.222
- What is this?
- Hey, don't move.

22:35.390 --> 22:37.308
What did you do to me?

22:37.476 --> 22:38.559
I didn't do anything.

22:38.935 --> 22:40.603
- It's Jigsaw.
- What?

22:40.770 --> 22:44.231
I knew this was gonna happen
to me. This is what he does.

22:45.317 --> 22:46.901
No, it's not Jigsaw.

22:49.029 --> 22:50.404
He's dead.

22:50.572 --> 22:52.823
Haven't you watched TV lately?

22:53.450 --> 22:55.159
Yeah, well, whoever it is...

22:55.911 --> 22:56.994
...they're watching us.

23:01.708 --> 23:03.501
To make sure we follow the rules.

23:03.668 --> 23:06.086
- Which are what?
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

23:06.254 --> 23:08.714
Unless you want your head
to pop off like a dandelion.

23:08.882 --> 23:11.342
- How do you know that?
- Because I have eyes.

23:12.511 --> 23:15.012
One pull-pin starts the timer
for all of us.

23:16.765 --> 23:20.935
You won't wanna do that unless
you know how it works, now, would you?

23:21.436 --> 23:23.479
You're starting to freak me out, dude.

23:28.068 --> 23:29.109
Hello, and welcome.

23:29.486 --> 23:34.031
From birth, you've all been given
the advantages of few others.

23:34.199 --> 23:36.951
Yet through poor moral decisions...

23:37.118 --> 23:40.120
...you've used these advantages
to selfishly further...

23:40.288 --> 23:43.874
...only yourselves
at the expense of others.

23:44.042 --> 23:47.795
Well, today this singular way of thinking
will be put to the test.

23:47.963 --> 23:52.967
Today, five will become one,
with a common goal of survival.

23:53.134 --> 23:54.343
You are all connected.

23:54.511 --> 23:56.929
A cable runs through
your collar devices.

23:57.097 --> 23:58.806
It can be pulled so tight...

23:58.974 --> 24:01.809
...that you will be decapitated
on the mounted razors.

24:02.811 --> 24:07.356
The only way to remove the collar
is with the keys from the glass boxes...

24:07.524 --> 24:09.066
...on the pedestals before you.

24:09.234 --> 24:12.403
However, if one of you moves
to retrieve a key...

24:12.571 --> 24:15.948
...the 60-second timer
will begin for you all.

24:16.491 --> 24:18.576
In choosing how to react
to this situation...

24:18.743 --> 24:21.787
...your lifelong instincts
will tell you to do one thing...

24:21.955 --> 24:25.124
...but I implore you to do the opposite.

24:26.334 --> 24:27.960
Let the games begin.

24:31.840 --> 24:33.841
Somebody has to die.

24:34.009 --> 24:37.595
No, no, no, it says,
"Don't listen to your instincts. "

24:37.762 --> 24:40.180
- That means don't go for the keys.
- You fucking nuts?

24:40.348 --> 24:42.349
How are we supposed to live
if we don't?

24:42.517 --> 24:44.810
- It's testing our endurance.
- We gotta move, babe.

24:44.978 --> 24:47.021
That timer's connected to those jars.

24:47.188 --> 24:49.023
It didn't say anything
about those jars.

24:49.190 --> 24:51.317
- They could be nothing.
They're nail bombs.

24:51.484 --> 24:53.444
Homemade, probably C-4.

24:53.653 --> 24:55.237
How the fuck do you know that?

24:55.405 --> 24:58.574
She's a fire inspector.
She's seen all kinds of demented shit.

24:58.742 --> 25:00.701
How do you know me?

25:02.954 --> 25:05.998
Hey, man, she's asking you a question.
How do you know her?

25:08.877 --> 25:12.087
How do you know her? Answer me!

25:12.255 --> 25:14.548
Look, let's just keep our cool.

25:14.716 --> 25:17.885
- Okay, we can figure this out.
- We're all here for a reason.

25:18.595 --> 25:21.639
Okay, and we're all connected,
as the message said.

25:21.806 --> 25:23.474
We just need to...

25:25.727 --> 25:28.729
- What did you do?
- You go first.

25:31.900 --> 25:35.027
It said that we were all born
with advantages.

25:35.570 --> 25:37.529
Right? That means
we're all from money.

25:40.617 --> 25:42.201
- I'm not.
- And neither am I.

25:42.369 --> 25:45.162
Hey, nice fucking try, Nancy Drew.

25:45.330 --> 25:47.164
Well, then, what does it mean?

25:47.332 --> 25:49.917
We did something wrong
with an advantage from birth.

25:50.085 --> 25:53.587
- That doesn't have to mean money.
- What are you not telling us? Huh?

25:54.005 --> 25:57.091
You know about her, what do you know
about the rest of us?

25:57.258 --> 25:59.885
Would you fucking talk to me?

26:00.053 --> 26:02.971
- Relax.
- I am fucking relaxed.

26:03.139 --> 26:05.391
It's a game, tweaker.

26:05.850 --> 26:10.104
Get it? The less you know about me,
the better.

26:10.271 --> 26:13.232
The reason why you fucked up
your charmed existence...

26:13.400 --> 26:15.693
...is pretty obvious to everyone, isn't it?

26:17.487 --> 26:19.363
Fuck you. Fuck you.

26:19.531 --> 26:21.782
Been playing with matches again,
have we?

26:22.367 --> 26:24.243
Fuck all of you and your fucking plan.

28:10.892 --> 28:13.477
Unless you wanna be shredded
when those bombs go off...

28:14.020 --> 28:16.271
...I suggest we move on.

28:36.668 --> 28:38.210
What are you doing?

28:38.378 --> 28:40.170
Being smart.

28:50.098 --> 28:51.348
Special Agent Strahm's office.

28:51.516 --> 28:55.227
This is Detective Hoffman.
Is Agent Strahm available?

28:55.395 --> 28:58.063
He's not, but I can connect you
to Special Agent Erickson.

28:58.231 --> 28:59.773
He's handling all inquiries.

28:59.941 --> 29:01.316
Please.

29:03.444 --> 29:05.863
You've reached
the voice mail box of Agent Erickson.

29:06.030 --> 29:08.115
Please leave a message.

29:08.283 --> 29:10.784
Yeah, this is Detective Hoffman.

29:10.952 --> 29:13.453
I needed to discuss something
with Agent Strahm...

29:13.621 --> 29:15.539
...but I can't seem to track him down.

29:15.707 --> 29:19.126
Could you give me a call?
It would be greatly appreciated.

30:19.354 --> 30:21.563
There you are.

31:09.070 --> 31:11.238
Sister.

31:41.602 --> 31:43.020
Peter.

31:45.773 --> 31:48.942
- Cowan, take this to analysis.
- Right away, sir.

31:51.029 --> 31:52.279
What are you doing here?

31:52.447 --> 31:56.950
Just grabbing some stuff from the office.
I'm taking your advice.

31:57.827 --> 32:01.413
- Taking some time off, huh?
- Yeah, well, I have to heal up, you know.

32:01.581 --> 32:02.664
Mm-hm.

32:02.915 --> 32:06.043
You know, I'll keep in touch.
I'll see you around.

33:36.300 --> 33:37.759
Hoffman.

33:37.927 --> 33:41.680
We got another body.
Looks like another Jigsaw victim.

33:41.848 --> 33:45.058
- You up for this?
- Yeah.

33:46.144 --> 33:47.602
Typical bio. Murder convict.

33:47.770 --> 33:50.355
Served five years,
just released last month.

33:53.860 --> 33:55.402
I know him.

33:55.736 --> 33:58.029
His name's Seth Baxter.

33:58.489 --> 34:00.824
My sister's ex-boyfriend.

34:02.243 --> 34:04.744
This is the guy
that murdered your sister?

34:04.912 --> 34:09.958
He was sentenced to 25 years.
Got it reduced to five on a technicality.

34:11.502 --> 34:14.045
Well, then I'd say justice was served.

34:23.806 --> 34:27.893
You killed him.
Made it look like a Jigsaw trap.

34:30.396 --> 34:32.147
I got you.

34:37.195 --> 34:40.739
Not yet.
- Don't close the door. It'll set off the timer.

34:40.907 --> 34:43.408
Do you know that for sure?
Educated guess.

34:43.576 --> 34:45.784
What we need to do
is figure out who everyone is.

34:45.953 --> 34:49.539
Okay, well, we know that the dead woman
worked for the fire department.

34:49.706 --> 34:52.125
Not anymore.
She got canned a month ago.

34:52.293 --> 34:54.753
How the fuck do you...?
How the fuck do you know that?

34:54.920 --> 34:57.797
You're responsible for this?
She had her fucking head cut off!

34:57.965 --> 34:59.090
I'm closing the door.

34:59.258 --> 35:01.885
- I'm gonna close the fucking door!
- Just be quiet.

35:03.304 --> 35:04.930
Please.

35:09.101 --> 35:10.268
What's your story?

35:10.436 --> 35:12.479
I work for
the Department of City Planning.

35:12.647 --> 35:15.982
- Married? Kids?
- No, and no.

35:16.150 --> 35:19.736
- Your turn.
- You're not gonna tell them about Daddy?

35:22.782 --> 35:27.118
- My dad is Richard Gibbs.
- The owner of the Cougars?

35:27.286 --> 35:31.581
He's been trying to build a new stadium
for years. Little did he know...

35:31.749 --> 35:37.128
...all he had to do is wait for his daughter
to get a job in City Planning.

35:38.381 --> 35:40.966
And you. What about you?

35:41.133 --> 35:43.343
What sort of shady shit
have you been up to?

35:43.511 --> 35:46.429
I'm a senior V.P.
For a real estate development company.

35:46.597 --> 35:48.932
So you're boring too. Hmm?

35:50.685 --> 35:54.396
The Marshvard Group.
Yeah, you can't get a permit in this town...

35:54.563 --> 35:57.732
...without going through
the Department of City Planning.

35:57.900 --> 36:00.568
- Right?
- No, you can't.

36:00.736 --> 36:02.362
What about you?

36:02.530 --> 36:03.863
Uh...

36:04.240 --> 36:05.949
No wife.

36:06.117 --> 36:11.871
- No kids that I know of. No job.
- Trust-fund baby. Anyone surprised?

36:12.039 --> 36:14.374
I'm so fucking sick of
your self-righteousness.

36:14.542 --> 36:15.709
It's your turn.

36:15.876 --> 36:20.714
I'm an investigative journalist
for The Herald.

36:20.881 --> 36:24.342
Herald? That's your accomplishment?
You work for a gossip rag?

36:24.510 --> 36:26.344
Bite your fucking tongue.

36:26.512 --> 36:29.055
What the hell are in those jars?

36:30.099 --> 36:33.601
Let's do this fucking thing
before the bombs go off.

36:40.318 --> 36:41.651
Fuck!

36:42.528 --> 36:45.405
Hello, and welcome to the next lesson.

36:45.573 --> 36:48.742
These walls hold four chambers.

36:50.578 --> 36:52.329
These chambers are for safety.

36:52.496 --> 36:55.332
However, to access them,
a key is needed.

36:55.499 --> 36:59.085
But only three of the keys
will fit the locks.

36:59.253 --> 37:03.006
These keys are in the glass jars
hanging from the ceiling.

37:03.174 --> 37:06.301
Move quickly, though,
because when the clock ticks down...

37:06.469 --> 37:11.181
...the explosives in the corners
of the room will detonate.

37:11.349 --> 37:16.102
With only three points of safety,
which of you will be the odd man out?

37:16.812 --> 37:18.438
Make your choice.

37:21.609 --> 37:22.776
Fuck.

37:29.617 --> 37:32.452
Fuck, it's blank. I need a shape.

37:35.373 --> 37:37.791
Get your hands off that,
you're not going anywhere.

37:40.378 --> 37:42.796
- Stop it!
Get a clue, you fucking bitch.

37:42.963 --> 37:44.964
It's survival of the fittest.

38:00.314 --> 38:02.107
Blank.

38:03.275 --> 38:04.651
Blank.

38:07.947 --> 38:09.406
Shit.

38:10.074 --> 38:12.117
I got it. Got it.

38:24.130 --> 38:26.005
Yes.

38:32.680 --> 38:35.598
Better luck next time, rich boy.

38:37.685 --> 38:39.477
Survival of the fittest, my ass!

38:53.325 --> 38:54.701
Wait.

39:18.893 --> 39:21.895
Everything all right with
Detective Kerr in the Seth Baxter case?

39:22.062 --> 39:23.146
- Yeah.
- Good.

39:23.314 --> 39:26.191
Fisk. You keep me posted.

39:26.358 --> 39:28.902
- Will do.
- Good.

39:29.069 --> 39:33.823
After Seth,
you were involved in every investigation.

39:42.166 --> 39:44.334
When did you first meet Jigsaw?

40:48.774 --> 40:51.025
Stop it, stop it!

41:01.787 --> 41:03.204
Don't!

41:08.544 --> 41:11.004
Heel! Heel, I said!

41:11.171 --> 41:13.089
Don't provoke him. Asshole!

41:14.174 --> 41:17.343
Jesus Christ.
Come on, Peewee. Come on.

41:17.511 --> 41:19.846
- Come on, Peewee.
- Peewee.

41:20.014 --> 41:21.431
Shit.

41:25.519 --> 41:27.604
Do you mind?

41:33.861 --> 41:35.987
Going up?
- Yes, thank you.

41:57.217 --> 41:59.302
What floor are you going to?

42:09.730 --> 42:12.940
I think we're both going
to the same place.

42:45.015 --> 42:47.475
You know why you're here, don't you?

42:49.645 --> 42:54.107
They say imitation
is the sincerest form of flattery.

42:55.984 --> 42:59.362
But I find it somewhat distasteful...

42:59.530 --> 43:02.365
...to be given credit for work
that's not mine.

43:08.205 --> 43:10.373
Especially inferior work.

43:15.170 --> 43:18.798
Like you,
I know what it's like to lose family.

43:20.217 --> 43:23.594
I know what it's like
not to be able to protect loved ones.

43:24.513 --> 43:27.140
It's a powerless feeling.

43:32.312 --> 43:33.479
I wouldn't do that.

43:39.653 --> 43:41.070
Hair trigger.

43:43.907 --> 43:45.825
What do you see?

43:47.161 --> 43:48.661
Hm?

43:49.496 --> 43:52.540
Vengeance can change a person.
Make you into something...

43:52.708 --> 43:55.668
...you never thought
you were capable of being.

43:57.254 --> 44:00.673
But unlike you, I've never killed anyone.

44:00.841 --> 44:04.177
- I give people a chance.
- You call this a chance?

44:04.344 --> 44:06.262
We'll see.

44:07.431 --> 44:12.518
- Our game's just begun.
- Our game? You don't even know me.

44:12.686 --> 44:14.187
Oh.

44:14.605 --> 44:19.358
I know you.
I've followed you as you've pursued me.

44:19.526 --> 44:22.653
I know you. I know about your sister.

44:22.821 --> 44:25.281
I know how you cared for her.

44:31.705 --> 44:33.664
I know she was your only family.

44:33.874 --> 44:35.708
Leave me alone.

44:39.213 --> 44:40.630
No!

44:48.263 --> 44:52.350
You sit in bars until closing.
You drink so you can sleep.

44:52.518 --> 44:54.018
You stagger to your car...

44:54.186 --> 44:58.272
...and then you start it all over again
the next day.

45:01.652 --> 45:05.071
Then I discovered
what you do for recreation.

45:09.451 --> 45:10.993
Mm.

45:11.578 --> 45:13.371
You can dispense justice...

45:13.539 --> 45:17.583
...and give people a chance
to value their lives in the same moment.

45:19.294 --> 45:21.128
And by the way...

45:21.880 --> 45:24.423
...the blade on your pendulum
was inferior.

45:25.926 --> 45:28.803
If you want a true edge...

45:31.807 --> 45:34.058
...you have to used tempered steel.

45:34.226 --> 45:37.228
Tempering's better for the long haul.

45:37.396 --> 45:39.438
You in this for the long haul, detective?

45:40.983 --> 45:44.193
I've been a cop for 20 years.
Is that long enough for you?

45:44.361 --> 45:48.447
Then you and I both know the statistics
for repeat offenders in this city.

45:48.615 --> 45:53.703
67.5 percent of criminals
are back in prison within three years.

45:53.871 --> 45:55.413
What do you want from me?

45:55.956 --> 45:59.584
So you might look at what you did to Seth
as a kind of public service.

46:01.295 --> 46:04.422
She was my only family.
He didn't deserve a chance.

46:04.631 --> 46:07.216
- He was an animal.
- Everybody deserves a chance!

46:07.384 --> 46:09.302
You didn't see the blood!

46:09.469 --> 46:11.721
You didn't see
what he fucking did to her!

46:11.889 --> 46:15.308
Killing is distasteful...

46:16.810 --> 46:18.394
...to me.

46:21.481 --> 46:25.651
There is a better, more efficient way.

46:33.619 --> 46:36.245
What do you see...? Look!

46:36.663 --> 46:39.874
- What do you see?
- Tell me what you want.

46:41.793 --> 46:46.255
I wanna know if you have
what it takes to survive.

47:05.776 --> 47:09.362
Fuck you.

47:11.323 --> 47:13.866
You see, it's a different method
that I'm talking about.

47:14.534 --> 47:16.535
If a subject survives my method...

47:16.954 --> 47:19.455
...he or she is instantly rehabilitated.

47:21.541 --> 47:23.626
Now, you want a chance?

47:25.045 --> 47:26.712
You want a chance?

47:26.880 --> 47:28.047
I'll give you a chance.

47:36.473 --> 47:39.558
I'm the man you call Jigsaw.

47:41.228 --> 47:43.437
It's your duty to bring me in...

47:43.605 --> 47:46.357
...but I know who you are...

47:46.525 --> 47:49.026
...and I know what you've done.

47:52.906 --> 47:54.323
So this is blackmail.

47:54.491 --> 47:55.574
No, no, no.

47:56.994 --> 47:59.245
This is redemption.

48:03.333 --> 48:06.377
Just giving you an option, that's all.

48:07.087 --> 48:09.547
Now, you can arrest me...

48:09.715 --> 48:13.843
...but doing so,
your life ends as you know it.

48:14.011 --> 48:15.344
Or...

48:15.512 --> 48:16.929
...you could explore...

48:18.181 --> 48:20.558
...a method of rehabilitation...

48:20.726 --> 48:23.102
...that'll permit you to sleep at night.

48:44.791 --> 48:46.417
Or I could kill you right now.

48:46.585 --> 48:48.961
But you're not a true killer.

48:49.963 --> 48:51.213
That's your dilemma...

48:51.381 --> 48:54.884
...and the information that I have on you
is exactly where it needs to be...

48:55.052 --> 48:59.180
...and it will be released
in the event of my disappearance.

48:59.931 --> 49:02.475
They'll never believe your word
over mine.

49:04.978 --> 49:07.104
You willing to take that risk?

49:07.272 --> 49:09.398
Risk of ruining your own life...

49:09.566 --> 49:12.026
...in order to protect
a corrupt legal system...

49:12.194 --> 49:15.780
...that puts murderers
back on the streets?

49:21.495 --> 49:23.579
How would your sister feel?

49:23.747 --> 49:25.831
You're at a crossroads, detective.

49:26.541 --> 49:28.667
Make your choice.

49:50.732 --> 49:53.192
Did you help Jigsaw get all of them?

50:40.157 --> 50:43.909
Detective Hoffman,
this is Special Agent Erickson.

50:44.077 --> 50:47.746
You had something you needed to discuss
about the Jigsaw case?

50:47.914 --> 50:52.251
Yes. I stopped by Agent Strahm's room
tonight at the hospital, but he wasn't there.

50:52.419 --> 50:54.670
- I hope he's all right.
- Oh, yeah, he's fine.

50:54.838 --> 50:57.256
Agent Strahm was theorizing
about the possibility...

50:57.424 --> 51:00.676
...of an additional accomplice
to Jigsaw, other than Amanda Young.

51:01.469 --> 51:04.388
Someone who might be
currently unknown.

51:04.556 --> 51:07.308
Did he ever mention
anything like that to you?

51:07.475 --> 51:09.643
No, but then again, I'm new to the case.

51:09.811 --> 51:13.522
Yeah, well, maybe you could get him
to contact me at his earliest convenience.

51:13.690 --> 51:16.066
Will do. And...

51:16.234 --> 51:18.360
...in your theorizing...

51:18.528 --> 51:21.071
...who exactly did you suspect
would be an accomplice?

51:22.782 --> 51:25.242
Well, he suspected
someone on the inside.

51:25.452 --> 51:26.660
Someone with access.

51:26.828 --> 51:29.121
It's an interesting theory.

51:29.289 --> 51:32.583
Detective, what do you say we reconnect
in the morning?

51:33.043 --> 51:34.627
You got it.

52:18.004 --> 52:19.338
Dead.

52:19.506 --> 52:22.341
That guy was an asshole,
but he was smart.

52:22.509 --> 52:23.634
We could've used him.

52:24.135 --> 52:26.512
Yeah, well, someone had to die.

52:28.556 --> 52:30.683
Would you rather it'd been you?

53:29.743 --> 53:31.327
How'd they get you?

54:42.524 --> 54:43.899
Screw you!

54:44.484 --> 54:47.820
I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you!

54:53.993 --> 54:56.286
I'm gonna kill...

55:38.997 --> 55:41.039
Hello, Paul.

55:41.207 --> 55:44.293
Did you cut yourself
because you truly wanted to die...

55:44.461 --> 55:48.213
...or did you just want some attention?

55:48.381 --> 55:50.048
Tonight, you'll show me.

55:50.216 --> 55:54.344
If you want to live,
you'll have to cut yourself again.

55:55.805 --> 55:59.766
How much blood will you shed
to stay alive, Paul?

56:50.318 --> 56:53.320
I didn't expect to feel any remorse.

56:53.905 --> 56:55.864
The heart cannot be involved.

56:56.032 --> 56:59.159
Emotionally, there can be nothing there.

56:59.327 --> 57:01.995
It can never be personal.

57:02.372 --> 57:04.790
- Let's go.
- No.

57:04.958 --> 57:07.042
You're not done yet.

57:07.210 --> 57:12.297
Tonight you will see the difference
between killing and rehabilitation.

57:24.644 --> 57:28.313
There is another detective
that you should be aware of.

57:28.481 --> 57:30.148
His name's Tapp.

57:30.316 --> 57:32.734
He's smart, and he's getting closer.

57:32.902 --> 57:35.028
I know who he is.

57:38.908 --> 57:42.327
I need you to lead him
to someone for me.

57:44.539 --> 57:46.498
A doctor.

57:47.667 --> 57:50.794
A healer who needs some healing.

57:54.549 --> 57:56.925
Is this yours, doctor?

58:04.434 --> 58:07.936
You supplied these police files,
didn't you?

58:39.719 --> 58:43.013
You're assuming this is gonna play out
the way you want it.

58:43.181 --> 58:45.265
I assume nothing.

58:49.937 --> 58:55.692
I anticipate the possibilities,
and I let the game play out.

58:56.194 --> 58:59.071
Then why do you need Amanda
in the game?

59:01.741 --> 59:04.910
To ensure that the rules are followed.

59:06.245 --> 59:10.290
She won't make decisions for anyone.
She'll just...

59:11.542 --> 59:13.710
...offer choices.

59:15.588 --> 59:17.756
Little to your left.

59:25.598 --> 59:27.974
That leaves a lot to chance.

59:42.949 --> 59:46.785
If you're good
at anticipating the human mind...

59:52.375 --> 59:55.210
...it leaves nothing to chance.

01:00:08.307 --> 01:00:09.933
It's time.

01:00:27.744 --> 01:00:30.162
Jesus Christ.

01:00:34.959 --> 01:00:37.586
Great. More bombs.

01:00:41.299 --> 01:00:44.134
All right. What'd you do to get here?

01:00:44.302 --> 01:00:48.889
L... I did something,
and a bunch of people were killed.

01:00:49.056 --> 01:00:50.682
I didn't mean to.

01:00:51.601 --> 01:00:54.144
They're still dead.

01:00:54.312 --> 01:00:56.188
- That's why you're here?
- Yeah.

01:00:56.355 --> 01:00:59.357
Shouldn't you have
gone to jail for something like that?

01:00:59.525 --> 01:01:01.610
Nobody else knows.

01:01:06.115 --> 01:01:07.532
Somebody does.

01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:19.961
I didn't kill anybody,
if that's what you're asking.

01:01:20.129 --> 01:01:21.463
I wasn't.

01:01:22.965 --> 01:01:25.050
I grant building permits.

01:01:28.012 --> 01:01:31.181
And yeah, some people might have been
more deserving than others...

01:01:31.349 --> 01:01:33.391
...but you know what?
That's the business.

01:01:33.559 --> 01:01:36.311
So if someone tells you different,
then they're just stupid.

01:01:36.479 --> 01:01:39.022
Or naive. Or both.

01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:40.357
Bullshit.

01:01:40.525 --> 01:01:44.486
You take bribes. You're a fucking liar.
You cheat people. That's not nice.

01:01:44.654 --> 01:01:46.238
Yeah, well.

01:01:46.405 --> 01:01:49.783
I'm sure she's not exactly
Mother Teresa either.

01:01:49.951 --> 01:01:51.618
No, I'm not.

01:01:52.495 --> 01:01:56.122
I build condos in one of the most
densely populated cities in the country.

01:01:56.290 --> 01:01:59.876
You don't put up a new building
without tearing down a few old ones.

01:02:00.044 --> 01:02:03.672
So we're all bags of shit that deserve
to be here. That's good. That's great.

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:04.881
Fucking great.

01:02:05.049 --> 01:02:07.384
So is that what you think this is?

01:02:07.552 --> 01:02:09.594
You don't think there's
any other connection?

01:02:09.762 --> 01:02:11.596
No, I do.

01:02:11.764 --> 01:02:14.099
I do. And I don't give a shit.

01:02:14.267 --> 01:02:17.394
Close the fucking door.
We have to hear the rules.

01:02:28.489 --> 01:02:29.948
Hello, and welcome.

01:02:30.116 --> 01:02:35.704
You must all be eager to learn the next
important lesson in your transformation.

01:02:35.872 --> 01:02:40.625
The game before you is designed
to bridge the gap between you all.

01:02:40.793 --> 01:02:44.462
In order to open the five locks
on the door out of this room...

01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:48.383
...the five electrical circuits
powering them must be closed.

01:02:48.551 --> 01:02:55.307
The only way to do this is to find a way
to connect all five cords to the bath water.

01:02:55.474 --> 01:02:58.643
Close the circuits
and the door will open.

01:02:58.811 --> 01:03:00.145
But you must work quickly...

01:03:00.313 --> 01:03:03.815
...for in three minutes, an electrical current
will surge through this room...

01:03:03.983 --> 01:03:06.735
...locking the door forever.

01:03:06.903 --> 01:03:11.156
Who will bridge the gap?
The choice is yours.

01:03:14.327 --> 01:03:15.952
Jesus Christ.

01:03:21.667 --> 01:03:24.252
It's not gonna reach.
How the fuck are we gonna do this?

01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:25.962
Come on!

01:03:27.924 --> 01:03:29.966
You're gonna get in the tub...

01:03:30.593 --> 01:03:33.011
...and we're gonna connect the five cords
to you.

01:03:33.179 --> 01:03:34.596
But you're gonna kill me too.

01:03:36.766 --> 01:03:39.351
- Get in.
- Yeah, I'm more of a shower guy.

01:03:39.518 --> 01:03:42.646
- I don't think I'm gonna do that right now.
- Get in the fucking tub.

01:03:42.813 --> 01:03:45.357
Fuck you, you bitch.
You get in the fucking tub.

01:03:46.859 --> 01:03:48.360
No, don't do it.

01:03:48.527 --> 01:03:50.236
Please, no.

01:04:00.873 --> 01:04:04.000
You killed her.
You fucking killed her.

01:04:04.168 --> 01:04:06.044
I didn't trust her.

01:04:06.212 --> 01:04:08.880
Jesus Christ. What is it with you two?

01:04:09.048 --> 01:04:11.549
Just shut up and help me with the body.

01:04:28.651 --> 01:04:32.237
Hey, hey. No.
Don't let your body touch hers.

01:05:00.266 --> 01:05:02.434
Oh, my God, it's a hook.

01:05:05.771 --> 01:05:08.440
Stick it in her head or we don't get out.

01:05:11.402 --> 01:05:13.361
Just do it

01:05:33.591 --> 01:05:35.133
Come in.

01:05:36.677 --> 01:05:39.471
Sir. It's Jill Tuck.

01:05:39.638 --> 01:05:41.306
Good evening.

01:05:41.474 --> 01:05:42.640
Special Agent Erickson.

01:05:42.808 --> 01:05:44.768
Thank you for seeing me
so late in the day.

01:05:44.935 --> 01:05:46.102
Not a problem.

01:05:46.270 --> 01:05:47.854
That'll be all.

01:05:49.315 --> 01:05:51.900
Please, have a seat.

01:05:53.152 --> 01:05:56.654
So, what do you need from us?

01:05:57.239 --> 01:05:59.491
I think I'm being followed.

01:05:59.658 --> 01:06:01.993
Well, that sounds more like
police work, Miss Tuck.

01:06:03.662 --> 01:06:05.830
I don't think they can help me.

01:06:05.998 --> 01:06:09.959
- Because?
- Because it's you. The FBI.

01:06:11.837 --> 01:06:13.338
I don't understand.

01:06:13.506 --> 01:06:16.800
It started when John was first identified
as the Jigsaw killer.

01:06:16.967 --> 01:06:19.677
It didn't surprise me then,
but I'm still being followed.

01:06:19.845 --> 01:06:23.348
By who, Miss Tuck?
Who would be following you?

01:06:23.516 --> 01:06:25.517
I think it's the agent
who interrogated me.

01:06:26.602 --> 01:06:27.936
Agent Strahm.

01:06:29.647 --> 01:06:33.024
- And why would he be following you?
- I don't know.

01:06:37.905 --> 01:06:41.199
- Who else have you told about this?
- Only you.

01:07:06.684 --> 01:07:08.726
What's going on with Amanda?

01:07:08.894 --> 01:07:12.564
Didn't you tell me
the only way to truly offer enlightenment...

01:07:13.023 --> 01:07:14.858
...is by detaching emotionally?

01:07:18.404 --> 01:07:21.197
But you can have something
Amanda doesn't.

01:07:21.740 --> 01:07:23.700
Anonymity.

01:07:23.868 --> 01:07:27.579
That's the greatest protection.
That's what I've given you.

01:07:28.205 --> 01:07:30.874
I need you to set up a game...

01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:35.503
...that may not be entirely clear to you
right now.

01:07:36.714 --> 01:07:39.340
But I assure you that
the people being tested...

01:07:40.426 --> 01:07:43.261
...are part of something much larger.

01:07:43.721 --> 01:07:45.430
They're connected.

01:07:45.598 --> 01:07:51.436
So in the end,
all the pieces will fit together...

01:07:53.522 --> 01:07:55.607
...and it'll be clear.

01:07:57.985 --> 01:07:59.360
Who are you?

01:07:59.653 --> 01:08:03.114
- Amanda will fail you.
- We'll see.

01:08:03.949 --> 01:08:06.534
What are you doing?

01:08:12.791 --> 01:08:16.294
What's this?
- It's time to play a game.

01:08:18.296 --> 01:08:19.671
Help.

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:21.758
Help me. What is this?

01:08:21.926 --> 01:08:24.093
What is this? Please.

01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:31.434
Why are you keeping me here?
What is this place? What is this place?

01:09:03.968 --> 01:09:06.678
We were all supposed to die.

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:13.350
He's just fucking testing you.

01:09:13.519 --> 01:09:15.185
Where is my daughter?

01:09:18.524 --> 01:09:20.441
Help!

01:09:20.859 --> 01:09:22.568
He didn't make it.

01:09:23.028 --> 01:09:24.904
Nobody made it.

01:09:25.197 --> 01:09:27.282
You were supposed to be the hero.

01:10:05.904 --> 01:10:07.947
Peter, where the hell are you?

01:10:10.617 --> 01:10:12.243
Hello?

01:10:22.087 --> 01:10:25.089
You've reached the voice mail
for Special Agent Peter Strahm.

01:10:25.257 --> 01:10:27.050
Leave a message.

01:10:29.928 --> 01:10:33.514
Cowan, I wanna put a locator
on Strahm's mobile phone.

01:10:34.308 --> 01:10:35.933
Right away, sir.

01:10:36.101 --> 01:10:37.643
Call me right back.

01:10:37.811 --> 01:10:39.395
Right.

01:11:39.832 --> 01:11:43.126
- What the hell is that?
- It's our next nightmare.

01:11:49.258 --> 01:11:51.634
There are blades in here.

01:11:56.014 --> 01:11:58.015
It's connected to the door.

01:11:58.183 --> 01:12:00.435
When the beaker fills up,
the door opens.

01:12:03.313 --> 01:12:05.231
Fills with what?

01:12:06.191 --> 01:12:09.861
Blood. Our blood.

01:12:10.696 --> 01:12:15.741
I think an arm is supposed to go in there
to fill the beaker.

01:12:16.243 --> 01:12:19.162
Wait. Why can't we just use
the water from the other room?

01:12:19.371 --> 01:12:20.538
No, the slots are closed.

01:12:20.706 --> 01:12:23.833
We have to stick our arm in to
keep them open, but they'd get stuck.

01:12:24.001 --> 01:12:25.793
We need to close that door.

01:12:27.379 --> 01:12:28.880
So, what?

01:12:29.465 --> 01:12:34.719
We fight to the death, and one gets
to freedom with the other person's blood?

01:12:40.184 --> 01:12:41.392
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:43.728
Do you still have the keys
from that first room?

01:12:43.896 --> 01:12:46.189
- Yeah.
- Try one of them on that door.

01:12:46.356 --> 01:12:49.484
- It won't work.
- No, it might. This one has a keyhole.

01:12:54.406 --> 01:12:56.866
It... It's not even the same lock.

01:13:00.245 --> 01:13:02.371
Wait, why are there five slots
in this machine?

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:05.082
Shouldn't there only be one?

01:13:12.007 --> 01:13:14.008
They all would have worked.

01:13:38.742 --> 01:13:40.284
There you are, Strahm.

01:13:41.286 --> 01:13:44.288
All right. I got him.

01:13:51.922 --> 01:13:54.131
I don't think this is a good idea.

01:13:54.299 --> 01:13:56.384
The tub wasn't meant for one person.

01:13:56.552 --> 01:13:58.469
We were supposed to hold
one cable each...

01:13:58.637 --> 01:14:01.013
...and suffer a small shock.

01:14:01.390 --> 01:14:02.807
It was meant for five people.

01:14:02.975 --> 01:14:05.226
They all were. Every game.

01:14:05.394 --> 01:14:07.895
We only needed one key
in the first room.

01:14:08.063 --> 01:14:11.691
They all worked, and any one of them
would have opened every collar.

01:14:12.150 --> 01:14:16.112
In the second room, the three tubes were
large enough for more than one person.

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:19.323
We were supposed to work together
so we all survived.

01:14:19.491 --> 01:14:21.158
That's the game.

01:14:21.326 --> 01:14:23.494
Your instincts will tell you to do
one thing...

01:14:23.662 --> 01:14:25.746
...but I implore you to do the opposite.

01:14:25.914 --> 01:14:27.456
Oh, God.

01:14:27.624 --> 01:14:30.543
Yeah. Big fucking whoops.

01:14:45.767 --> 01:14:47.435
Hello, and welcome.

01:14:47.603 --> 01:14:49.478
This journey
has been one of discovery...

01:14:49.646 --> 01:14:53.941
...and hopefully you've discovered that the
whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

01:14:54.651 --> 01:14:58.654
The human body, for instance,
is an astoundingly durable creation.

01:14:58.822 --> 01:15:01.574
It contains approximately 10 pints
of blood...

01:15:01.742 --> 01:15:05.745
...yet it is still able to operate
with just half of that.

01:15:05.912 --> 01:15:08.664
The device before you is
one of sacrifice.

01:15:08.832 --> 01:15:10.333
A sacrifice of blood.

01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:14.962
In order to open the door, the beaker
must be filled to the marked level...

01:15:15.130 --> 01:15:18.507
...a level that is of no coincidence.

01:15:18.675 --> 01:15:20.926
This amount can come
from any one of you.

01:15:21.094 --> 01:15:24.639
That does not matter.
What does matter is time.

01:15:24.806 --> 01:15:27.516
For in 15 minutes,
if the beaker is not filled...

01:15:27.684 --> 01:15:31.937
...the bombs will explode
and the doors will be sealed forever.

01:15:32.105 --> 01:15:36.984
So now I ask you, how much blood
will you give in order to survive?

01:15:43.075 --> 01:15:44.700
Fuck! Fuck.

01:15:45.327 --> 01:15:50.623
All right, so one person can fill the beaker
with ten pints of blood and die.

01:15:50.832 --> 01:15:52.792
Or two people can fill it...

01:15:52.959 --> 01:15:55.002
...with five pints...

01:15:55.170 --> 01:15:57.254
...and maybe live.

01:15:58.674 --> 01:15:59.924
What are we gonna do?

01:16:32.124 --> 01:16:33.374
I lied.

01:16:34.876 --> 01:16:37.962
I know the investigative journalist in there.
His name is Charles.

01:16:38.130 --> 01:16:40.756
He was writing a story about what I did.

01:16:41.967 --> 01:16:43.801
What'd you do?

01:16:45.637 --> 01:16:47.805
A dealer gave me...

01:16:47.973 --> 01:16:51.350
...an ounce of heroin to burn down
an abandoned building.

01:16:51.518 --> 01:16:52.560
But it wa...

01:16:52.728 --> 01:16:55.813
Oh, God. It wasn't abandoned.
There was eight people in there.

01:16:55.981 --> 01:16:59.358
Eight people died.

01:16:59.651 --> 01:17:03.154
And the feds got involved.

01:17:03.321 --> 01:17:05.990
And I got caught but I made a deal
and my dad got me off.

01:17:06.158 --> 01:17:09.493
The guy who hired me disappeared
and nothing happened. Nothing happened.

01:17:36.354 --> 01:17:38.314
That's how she knew me.

01:17:38.482 --> 01:17:40.691
The woman in the tub.

01:17:41.401 --> 01:17:43.819
The fire. It's what connects us.

01:17:44.571 --> 01:17:47.740
The fire inspector who wrote
the bogus accident report...

01:17:47.908 --> 01:17:51.869
...the city planner who pushed through
the residential permits...

01:17:52.245 --> 01:17:55.831
...the journalist that buried
the investigative story...

01:17:55.999 --> 01:17:58.959
...the rich-kid junkie
who was the patsy...

01:17:59.127 --> 01:18:02.046
...and the real estate developer
who set it all in motion.

01:18:02.714 --> 01:18:06.967
We killed eight people
and stole the property, and nobody cared.

01:18:07.761 --> 01:18:08.844
Nobody cared?

01:18:09.387 --> 01:18:12.056
Eight people and their families cared.

01:18:12.224 --> 01:18:15.893
The feds cared. Look at my fucking arm.
I cared! I cared!

01:18:16.561 --> 01:18:18.020
But you didn't face justice.

01:18:18.563 --> 01:18:19.647
None of us did.

01:18:19.815 --> 01:18:22.066
Why did they all do it?

01:18:22.234 --> 01:18:23.359
Why? Was it for money?

01:18:24.236 --> 01:18:26.737
This was your plan?
You were the one behind it?

01:18:27.572 --> 01:18:31.742
There was eight people in that building.
You had to know that. Did you know that?

01:18:33.119 --> 01:18:34.578
You're a monster.

01:18:39.167 --> 01:18:40.501
So are you.

01:18:41.294 --> 01:18:44.213
We both deserve to be here.

01:19:37.142 --> 01:19:39.810
I can't do this alone. Look at me.
I can't do this alone.

01:19:39.978 --> 01:19:41.061
Okay. It's okay.

01:20:06.504 --> 01:20:07.755
We have to go on three.

01:20:26.191 --> 01:20:27.191
One.

01:20:35.241 --> 01:20:37.159
Two.

01:20:40.956 --> 01:20:43.165
Put your hand in the hole!

01:20:51.549 --> 01:20:53.175
Three!

01:22:22.307 --> 01:22:23.724
Hello, Agent Strahm.

01:22:24.184 --> 01:22:28.937
If you are hearing this, then you have
once again found what you're looking for.

01:22:29.105 --> 01:22:30.481
Or so you think.

01:22:30.648 --> 01:22:33.525
Your dedication is to be commended.

01:22:33.693 --> 01:22:38.363
But I ask you if you have learned anything
on your journey of discovery.

01:22:38.531 --> 01:22:40.407
As the old adage goes:

01:22:40.575 --> 01:22:46.080
"Fool me once, shame on you.
Fool me twice, shame on me. "

01:22:46.539 --> 01:22:50.709
The situation you find yourself in
is one of trust.

01:22:50.877 --> 01:22:55.339
So I ask you, Special Agent Strahm,
have you learned to trust me?

01:22:55.507 --> 01:23:00.844
The only way to survive this room
is by entering the glass box before you.

01:23:01.012 --> 01:23:06.016
Pain will be incurred,
but you have a chance of survival.

01:23:34.045 --> 01:23:35.170
We did it.

01:23:35.338 --> 01:23:38.507
We won.

01:25:26.783 --> 01:25:29.326
I got you, you motherfucker.

01:25:51.349 --> 01:25:52.641
Drop it!

01:25:52.809 --> 01:25:54.810
I said drop it!

01:26:01.192 --> 01:26:04.361
Who did this to you?

01:26:06.948 --> 01:26:10.200
We won.

01:26:10.368 --> 01:26:12.703
We worked together.

01:26:23.172 --> 01:26:27.926
I need immediate medical assistance.
1293 Sandburst Drive.

01:27:08.134 --> 01:27:10.218
Jesus, Peter.

01:27:26.611 --> 01:27:28.362
Tell me how to open it.

01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:29.780
How do I open it?

01:27:42.794 --> 01:27:46.546
However, if you choose not to,
you will never be heard from again.

01:27:46.714 --> 01:27:48.924
Your body will never be found.

01:27:49.092 --> 01:27:50.967
You will simply vanish.

01:27:51.803 --> 01:27:57.641
I ask you, Special Agent Strahm,
have you learned enough to trust me?

01:27:57.809 --> 01:27:59.559
Will you heed my warning?

01:27:59.727 --> 01:28:01.645
- For if you do not...
- Fuck you.

01:28:01.813 --> 01:28:04.189
...this room will forever be your tomb.

01:28:04.357 --> 01:28:07.484
And my legacy will become yours.

01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:10.487
If you're good at anticipating
the human mind...

01:28:10.655 --> 01:28:13.323
- I think I'm being followed.
- Who would be following you?

01:28:13.491 --> 01:28:15.826
I wanna talk to Jill Tuck one last time.

01:28:15.993 --> 01:28:18.245
He suspected someone on the inside.

01:28:20.623 --> 01:28:22.958
- It leaves nothing to chance.

01:28:26.337 --> 01:28:28.004
We were all supposed to die.

01:28:29.340 --> 01:28:31.007
You were supposed to be the hero.

01:28:34.679 --> 01:28:36.096
Make your choice.

01:28:40.935 --> 01:28:42.477
Cowan.

01:28:42.645 --> 01:28:43.854
Yeah, this is Erickson.

01:28:44.021 --> 01:28:46.440
I want you to put out an APB.

01:28:46.858 --> 01:28:49.651
Suspect's name is Peter Strahm.

01:28:50.069 --> 01:28:51.778
Yeah, that's right.

01:28:51.946 --> 01:28:53.989
Special Agent Peter Strahm.

01:29:16.387 --> 01:29:18.847
I'm gonna stop you, you son of a bitch.

01:29:22.185 --> 01:29:25.061
I know who you are. I know.
