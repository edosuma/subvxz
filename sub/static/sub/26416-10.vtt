00:01.784 --> 00:02.915
We're not here to fight.

00:02.959 --> 00:04.047
We're not your enemy.

00:04.091 --> 00:05.396
Previously on Z Nation.

00:05.440 --> 00:07.746
So why the big mystery
around these bizkits anyway?

00:07.790 --> 00:09.270
Nobody likes to talk about
the fact

00:09.313 --> 00:10.706
that they contain
human brain matter.

00:10.749 --> 00:12.316
Well where they getting
the brains from then?

00:12.360 --> 00:14.927
The secret ingredient
must be in the flour.

00:15.406 --> 00:18.540
The chief says what we seek
is buried under the past,

00:18.583 --> 00:22.065
but beware, it is guarded
by demons with sharp claws.

00:23.632 --> 00:26.243
Buried under the past.

00:26.287 --> 00:27.897
What does that mean?

00:27.940 --> 00:30.552
Umm, did you hear the part about
the demons with the sharp claws?

01:22.256 --> 01:24.432
This is unacceptable!

01:24.475 --> 01:27.087
I don't care how freaked out
these Ts are!

01:27.348 --> 01:29.828
Keep them working!

01:30.742 --> 01:31.265
You!

01:31.830 --> 01:33.093
Come on!

01:34.442 --> 01:38.576
I want these barrels
full of raw by dark!

02:58.569 --> 02:59.396
Hey.

03:00.092 --> 03:00.963
Hey.

03:09.014 --> 03:10.668
Hey, look at me.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.279
Watch.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.345
Welcome to the party.

03:55.322 --> 03:56.627
Pick it up!

03:57.280 --> 03:59.761
Come on! Pick it up, Talker!

04:00.544 --> 04:04.244
Damn, these things get stupider
by the minute.

04:27.397 --> 04:28.355
Move!

04:35.797 --> 04:37.842
Pick it up, Talker!

04:39.191 --> 04:42.412
This place should've been
picked clean a week ago!

04:42.456 --> 04:45.807
Put it in the barrel.

04:50.159 --> 04:52.335
Let that be a warning.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.555
Now get back to work!

04:54.598 --> 04:56.034
All of you!

04:57.819 --> 04:58.602
What?

04:58.950 --> 05:00.387
We got another one?

05:11.093 --> 05:12.355
Weapons on the ground.

05:12.399 --> 05:13.617
Do as he says!

05:13.661 --> 05:14.792
All of them!

05:16.446 --> 05:18.666
All right, easy.
Easy now, easy now. Look.

05:18.709 --> 05:19.536
It's all good.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.843
Oh we are far from all good.

05:21.886 --> 05:23.497
You just shot my friend.

05:23.540 --> 05:26.369
He was already dead.
I was just making a point.

05:26.413 --> 05:30.591
No, you were inflicting pain
on a fellow being. How dare you!

05:31.940 --> 05:34.377
You're no better than us.

05:34.421 --> 05:35.813
I see that so clearly now.

05:36.161 --> 05:38.599
Your heart still beats,
but so what?

05:38.642 --> 05:40.775
You bleeders
destroyed this world.

05:40.818 --> 05:43.604
You have forfeited
your right to live!

05:47.216 --> 05:48.783
Now it's our turn.

05:51.829 --> 05:54.354
Talkers! Rise up!

05:54.397 --> 05:55.746
Listen to me!

05:55.790 --> 05:57.618
Our time has come!

05:58.401 --> 06:01.143
Freedom is here!
Freedom for all of us!

06:02.666 --> 06:06.235
No longer will we be oppressed,
exploited, or murdered!

06:07.541 --> 06:10.282
We will live out our deaths
as we decide!

06:11.371 --> 06:12.154
Yeah!

06:17.594 --> 06:18.856
Join me.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.643
No more will we be slaves
to the living!

06:24.166 --> 06:26.124
Our time is now!

06:27.952 --> 06:29.214
We will be free!

06:29.867 --> 06:30.607
Now!

06:33.218 --> 06:37.484
And we will free every Talker
enslaved in this mine!

06:37.527 --> 06:42.967
We will bring them out into the
light by any means necessary!

06:45.405 --> 06:48.973
There's nothing to fear
if we stick together!

06:58.330 --> 06:59.114
Fire!

06:59.810 --> 07:00.681
Fire! Damn it!

07:20.527 --> 07:22.180
Have mercy.

like there's no apocalypse.

08:05.136 --> 08:06.834
Yeah, what was in that crate?

08:06.877 --> 08:09.489
What it is,
I'll bet it's headed to Altura.

08:11.142 --> 08:12.448
I think you're right.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.363
But where is it coming from?

They're Talkers all right.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.030
Talkers?

09:13.553 --> 09:15.424
What are they doing?

09:15.467 --> 09:16.599
They're scavenging.

09:16.991 --> 09:17.948
Electronics.

09:18.340 --> 09:19.646
Phones. Laptops.

09:20.647 --> 09:22.866
They're mining something.

09:23.867 --> 09:26.217
Caution. Hazardous materials.

09:26.478 --> 09:27.392
Of course.

09:28.655 --> 09:30.091
Why can't the signs ever say
anything nice?

Want me take up a position?

09:42.538 --> 09:43.974
Good to have you back, baby boy.

09:44.018 --> 09:45.585
But I need to figure out
what's going on

09:45.628 --> 09:46.629
before you start
shooting people.

09:46.673 --> 09:48.326
We're gonna split up.

09:48.370 --> 09:50.633
You and Doc go figure out where
they're loading these trucks.

09:50.677 --> 09:52.853
And we are gonna check out
these miners.

09:52.896 --> 09:54.419
That didn't take long.

10:20.445 --> 10:21.577
What happened?

10:31.935 --> 10:34.285
Damn. Something sucked him
right in there.

10:35.112 --> 10:36.331
Creepy, right?

10:36.374 --> 10:39.116
Yeah. Creepy.

10:44.731 --> 10:46.646
Let's go find those trucks.

10:59.746 --> 11:00.660
Come on.

11:00.703 --> 11:02.879
More of this! Faster!

11:04.011 --> 11:05.099
Come on.

11:05.142 --> 11:05.969
Move it!

11:06.796 --> 11:07.884
More.

11:08.798 --> 11:09.669
Look.

11:10.104 --> 11:13.150
This or this.

11:14.891 --> 11:15.675
Come on!

11:19.113 --> 11:22.159
Worthless! If I had bizkits,

11:22.203 --> 11:26.468
I'd have this place picked dry
in 24 hours!

11:26.511 --> 11:28.122
But no!

11:29.036 --> 11:31.299
You need to pick up the pace.

11:31.342 --> 11:32.561
Where's Henley?

11:33.301 --> 11:35.912
This or this.

11:35.956 --> 11:37.697
There'll be enough time
for that.

11:38.088 --> 11:40.656
These Talkers
are pretty far gone.

11:40.700 --> 11:41.570
No bizkits.

11:41.613 --> 11:43.528
Maybe the toxic stew around here

11:43.572 --> 11:45.356
is what's keeping them
from turning.

11:49.709 --> 11:50.710
Hey.

11:51.319 --> 11:52.712
Check this out.

12:09.903 --> 12:13.297
Do not go down there.

12:15.038 --> 12:17.606
The metal is alive.

Back to work.

12:19.042 --> 12:21.305
No. Not safe.

12:21.349 --> 12:26.528
Oh, you're a talkative Talker,
huh? Come on. Back to work!

12:40.542 --> 12:42.674
Did you see how that Talker
snapped out of it?

12:42.718 --> 12:44.981
Like somebody threw a bucket
of cold water on him.

12:45.025 --> 12:48.724
Whatever they're mining
affects the Talkers.

12:49.290 --> 12:51.118
The secret ingredient?

12:55.557 --> 12:58.560
We got to get our hands on
whatever's in those barrels.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.345
There's only three of them.

13:03.608 --> 13:05.436
I've got an idea.

13:06.089 --> 13:06.873
Here.

13:08.918 --> 13:10.224
Cover me.

13:10.267 --> 13:11.268
George.

13:12.313 --> 13:13.183
Hey.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.274
Thank you.

13:44.780 --> 13:46.826
What are you doing over there?

13:46.869 --> 13:47.391
Huh?

13:57.445 --> 13:59.751
You got barrels to fill. Go.

14:10.806 --> 14:11.720
Warren!

14:19.467 --> 14:20.642
Cease fire. Cease fire!

14:21.643 --> 14:23.601
Get those Talkers back to work,

14:23.645 --> 14:26.343
so we can get the hell
out of here.

Warren?

14:55.720 --> 14:57.374
Oh no.

15:44.421 --> 15:45.857
Damn.

16:23.069 --> 16:24.635
What the...

16:32.034 --> 16:34.732
Whatever they're guarding
must be important.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.474
Doc?

16:37.518 --> 16:39.520
Someday, kid, this is gonna be
all that's left of us.

16:39.563 --> 16:42.740
Mountains full of crap
and oceans full of plastic.

16:43.176 --> 16:45.743
We'll all be dead, so who cares?

16:47.571 --> 16:49.660
Yeah. Right.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.580
It's more of the same junk.

16:56.624 --> 16:59.192
One man's junk
is another man's treasure.

17:01.107 --> 17:03.805
Yeah, no,
that didn't come out right.

17:47.849 --> 17:49.503
What are they doing
with all this?

17:49.546 --> 17:50.721
Who knows.

17:55.639 --> 17:57.424
They're melting down parts?

18:29.020 --> 18:31.153
What the hell is that

18:31.197 --> 18:33.199
I don't think you have to be
that careful with silver.

18:33.242 --> 18:35.026
Whatever it is,
they're afraid of it.

18:37.725 --> 18:40.249
Those militia bastards,
probably killing more Talkers.

18:41.381 --> 18:43.513
What happened?
Did you push something?

18:45.036 --> 18:46.081
Oh.

18:50.825 --> 18:53.828
Well they know something
we don't. Come on, let's split.

18:55.351 --> 18:56.700
Warren?

18:57.440 --> 18:58.702
Warren?

18:59.181 --> 19:01.052
Hey.

19:01.096 --> 19:02.880
What are you doing up there?

19:03.838 --> 19:05.361
Get down from there!

19:09.887 --> 19:13.543
Move or be mercied.

19:25.251 --> 19:28.471
I got a special tunnel
just for you.

19:28.950 --> 19:30.865
Send this one down too.

19:31.126 --> 19:32.780
Shoot 'em if they resist.

19:32.823 --> 19:33.955
Hell,

19:34.521 --> 19:36.827
shoot anything
that doesn't move right.

19:41.571 --> 19:42.703
I don't like this.

19:43.965 --> 19:45.923
Keep your eyes peeled.

19:45.967 --> 19:49.710
Ten more barrels!
Then we roll out! Move it!

19:49.753 --> 19:51.929
Come on! Get them in there!

19:51.973 --> 19:52.713
Go!

20:36.104 --> 20:37.410
Zombies?

20:37.453 --> 20:39.020
We'd a heard them.

20:39.281 --> 20:40.326
Talkers did this?

20:41.631 --> 20:42.415
Nah.

20:43.372 --> 20:45.853
No, they're too,
I dunno, stoned.

20:55.428 --> 20:57.952
What, did they shoot each other?

20:58.300 --> 21:00.259
Well they fired out. But...

21:00.694 --> 21:01.999
at what?

21:02.870 --> 21:05.089
Whatever it was, it was big.

21:08.963 --> 21:10.007
No baby goats.

21:10.051 --> 21:12.358
No baby goats.

24:06.357 --> 24:07.663
We didn't mean to.

24:08.098 --> 24:10.057
We were just following orders.

24:21.068 --> 24:24.027
Don't go down there.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.596
Do you have bizkits?

24:34.777 --> 24:37.388
Brings you back from the abyss.

24:38.738 --> 24:40.783
Doesn't last long though.

24:43.133 --> 24:45.048
No. I'm still alive.

24:46.136 --> 24:48.008
I'm looking for my friend.

24:51.620 --> 24:53.970
Don't go down there.

24:59.846 --> 25:01.021
More barrels!

25:01.064 --> 25:02.718
Move it! Come on!

25:03.371 --> 25:04.111
Move!

25:50.157 --> 25:51.854
Check this out.

25:52.986 --> 25:55.597
Maybe we can find
Warren and George.

26:01.516 --> 26:02.909
What does this button do?

26:07.566 --> 26:09.437
Hmm. Nothing.

26:09.480 --> 26:10.481
Try that thing.

26:23.712 --> 26:24.278
Oops.

26:27.237 --> 26:28.325
My bad.

26:28.369 --> 26:30.632
I guess we know
what that one does.

26:30.676 --> 26:32.199
Maybe we should't be doing this.

26:32.242 --> 26:34.331
I know. But it's kinda fun.

26:34.941 --> 26:37.030
Uh oh. Close the door quick!

26:41.338 --> 26:42.209
Open up!

26:45.516 --> 26:47.127
All okay here.

26:47.170 --> 26:48.737
Yeah, situation normal.

26:48.781 --> 26:50.043
Where's Cooley and Hood?

26:50.086 --> 26:51.435
What's going on

26:51.479 --> 26:52.480
I'm Siegfried.

26:52.523 --> 26:53.742
This is my partner,

26:54.395 --> 26:55.091
Roy.

26:56.527 --> 26:59.400
The boss sent us here to
speed up the operation.

26:59.443 --> 27:00.923
Estes sent you?

27:01.184 --> 27:03.099
That's right. Estes.

27:04.100 --> 27:06.712
He's not happy. He needs you
to make more of them...

27:07.060 --> 27:07.669
Bricks.

27:07.713 --> 27:09.628
Bricks. More.

27:09.671 --> 27:11.499
Yeah? Well screw Estes.

27:11.542 --> 27:13.936
He has no idea
what we're up against here.

27:13.980 --> 27:17.723
I got four men dead
or missing this last week.

27:17.766 --> 27:20.073
Even the Talkers are spooked.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.597
Any idea why?

27:23.511 --> 27:25.992
This place ain't just hazardous.

27:26.906 --> 27:28.124
It's haunted.

27:32.041 --> 27:34.043
Yeah well, haunted or not,

27:34.087 --> 27:36.045
you're gonna need to keep
feeding them conveyor belts

27:36.089 --> 27:39.266
or you're gonna end up with them
Talkers digging up truffles.

27:39.309 --> 27:40.006
Yeah, well listen.

27:41.181 --> 27:42.269
You tell Estes this mine's
been picked dry

27:42.312 --> 27:43.487
and he's wasting our time.

27:43.531 --> 27:45.446
Well you're wasting my time.

27:45.489 --> 27:48.188
Now if you'll excuse us,
we got work to do.

27:51.974 --> 27:54.498
Don't have to be such a dick
about it.

27:58.024 --> 28:00.548
Haunted? As if zombies
weren't bad enough.

28:00.591 --> 28:02.419
Let's go find Warren and George.

28:45.724 --> 28:46.376
Hey.

28:46.768 --> 28:47.595
Oh.

28:47.638 --> 28:48.161
Warren?

28:48.422 --> 28:49.597
You're okay.

28:51.947 --> 28:53.253
What is this?

28:53.775 --> 28:56.212
This is the man cave from hell.

28:56.735 --> 28:57.779
Zombies?

28:59.738 --> 29:00.477
No.

29:01.957 --> 29:04.394
Whatever it is, it eats
batteries like they're twinkies.

29:04.960 --> 29:05.874
Batteries?

29:06.179 --> 29:07.006
Yeah.

29:09.878 --> 29:12.576
The Talkers are eating batteries
like they're bizkits.

29:13.839 --> 29:14.970
What's in these?

29:18.017 --> 29:19.148
Lithium?

29:23.457 --> 29:26.939
What if lithium is the secret
ingredient in the bizkits?

29:26.982 --> 29:28.723
Well if they're scavenging
for lithium,

29:28.767 --> 29:29.985
why aren't they making bizkits?

29:30.377 --> 29:31.204
Okay.

29:32.335 --> 29:34.511
That's what we gotta find out.
But first,

29:35.164 --> 29:36.513
we gotta get out of here

29:36.557 --> 29:38.689
before our rechargeable friend
comes back.

29:39.125 --> 29:40.387
Is that the way?

29:40.996 --> 29:42.171
Yeah.

29:49.788 --> 29:50.789
Really?

29:55.489 --> 29:57.491
I hate the apocalypse.

30:09.546 --> 30:11.592
What do you want from us?

30:26.346 --> 30:28.870
Not so tough
without your guns now, are you?

30:28.914 --> 30:30.045
Found em!

30:31.742 --> 30:33.919
I'm getting the hang of this
now.

30:54.243 --> 30:55.592
Let's get the hell out of here.

30:55.636 --> 30:56.855
Okay.

31:03.383 --> 31:05.385
What is that thing?

31:12.958 --> 31:15.221
It's gaining on us! Run!

31:16.831 --> 31:17.353
Warren!

31:17.919 --> 31:18.746
10K!

31:18.789 --> 31:19.616
That way!

31:20.835 --> 31:21.880
Hurry!

31:25.666 --> 31:26.710
Move!

31:28.147 --> 31:29.844
Hurry!
There's a thing behind you!

31:31.977 --> 31:33.717
Come on! Come on!
Let's go, guys! Come on!

31:33.761 --> 31:35.197
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

31:35.241 --> 31:36.285
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on! Come on!

31:39.245 --> 31:40.159
God.

31:40.681 --> 31:41.725
Where'd it go?

31:42.639 --> 31:44.772
Nothing's getting through
that door.

31:44.815 --> 31:46.948
Well it looks like
it's already been here.

31:46.992 --> 31:49.516
It

31:49.559 --> 31:52.345
Something super weird
and super pissed.

31:52.388 --> 31:53.346
Is it gone?

31:53.389 --> 31:54.477
For now.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.088
What does it want?

31:56.566 --> 31:58.003
To be left alone.

31:58.046 --> 32:00.440
It has a lair of dead
bodies and batteries.

32:00.483 --> 32:02.529
It's been mining
this dump for a while.

32:02.572 --> 32:03.660
Mining for what?

32:04.096 --> 32:05.488
Lithium.

32:05.532 --> 32:08.013
Might be the secret ingredient
to the bizkits.

32:08.056 --> 32:10.102
Bizkits huh?
Well that makes sense.

32:10.145 --> 32:10.798
We just found out

32:12.104 --> 32:13.714
that Estes is in charge
of this whole operation.

32:14.019 --> 32:15.020
Estes?

32:16.369 --> 32:18.371
Whoever controls the bizkits
controls the Talkers.

32:18.414 --> 32:19.633
Whoever controls the Talkers...

32:19.676 --> 32:21.374
Controls Newmerica.

32:23.028 --> 32:24.159
Bastard.

32:24.986 --> 32:26.422
If that's true...

32:27.641 --> 32:28.816
What now?

32:29.251 --> 32:30.861
We get that last shipment
of lithium,

32:30.905 --> 32:32.820
and we get it to the Talkers
in Limbo.

32:32.863 --> 32:34.169
Oh crap.

32:34.865 --> 32:35.997
Looks like they had
the same idea.

32:36.041 --> 32:38.043
They're loading up
and bugging out.

32:38.869 --> 32:40.610
Not if we can help it.

32:40.654 --> 32:42.047
You thinking what I'm thinking?

32:43.962 --> 32:46.616
We're gonna hijack that truck.

33:01.501 --> 33:03.503
Move over. I'll drive.

33:16.820 --> 33:20.041
I'll be glad to leave this place
in the rear view mirror.

33:20.085 --> 33:21.738
Tell me about it.

33:30.399 --> 33:33.141
What are these two up to?

33:38.407 --> 33:41.802
Get in the back. The rest
will fend for themselves.

33:41.845 --> 33:43.282
We got new orders.

33:43.325 --> 33:45.501
We're taking this truck
by direct order from Estes.

33:47.590 --> 33:49.288
Aren't you gonna open up?

34:03.780 --> 34:05.782
Something's not right here.

34:41.166 --> 34:41.905
You got the keys?

34:41.949 --> 34:42.819
Yeah.

34:46.084 --> 34:47.563
You're flooding it.

34:53.134 --> 34:54.092
Come on.

35:00.228 --> 35:01.403
Doc!

35:08.889 --> 35:09.672
Okay.

35:10.195 --> 35:10.934
Sh...

35:39.180 --> 35:40.225
Come on!

35:44.359 --> 35:45.360
George!

36:17.566 --> 36:18.611
Oh shit.

36:41.764 --> 36:42.461
Whoa.

37:04.918 --> 37:05.962
Great.

37:09.749 --> 37:10.880
Get back.

37:12.534 --> 37:13.796
Everybody get back.

37:19.976 --> 37:22.152
What's happening to him?

37:27.549 --> 37:29.247
The battery's dying.

37:34.687 --> 37:36.254
Wear him out.

38:06.501 --> 38:07.850
Warren! No!

38:08.373 --> 38:09.243
No!

38:12.507 --> 38:13.421
Warren!

38:30.395 --> 38:31.874
Hey.

38:34.224 --> 38:35.922
You're still in there.

38:53.200 --> 38:55.071
I see you.

38:56.551 --> 38:58.161
Is it dead?

39:01.687 --> 39:03.210
He's trapped.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.519
Who is he?

39:07.562 --> 39:08.998
A Talker.

39:09.434 --> 39:11.000
I recognize him.

39:11.261 --> 39:13.568
He was one of the first miners
here.

39:13.612 --> 39:15.440
Went missing months ago.

39:15.918 --> 39:17.746
Too much lithium?

39:17.790 --> 39:19.487
An overdose or

39:19.835 --> 39:21.010
a power surge?

39:21.968 --> 39:23.012
Maybe both.

39:27.408 --> 39:30.237
What do you want?

39:35.373 --> 39:37.157
Let us help you.

39:58.657 --> 40:00.398
Where's he going?

40:36.172 --> 40:38.218
What the hell is he doing?

40:39.741 --> 40:40.916
He's going home.

41:36.885 --> 41:41.194
Is it me or is this apocalypse
getting weirder and weirder?

41:41.890 --> 41:43.501
It ain't you.

41:48.288 --> 41:49.637
Thank you.

41:49.681 --> 41:52.597
Thank you so much.

41:54.163 --> 41:56.514
You've given us back our life.

41:56.949 --> 41:58.211
Our soul.

41:58.646 --> 42:00.039
You're welcome.

42:05.044 --> 42:06.654
We need to load this truck up

42:06.698 --> 42:08.874
with as much lithium
as we can get our hands on.

42:08.917 --> 42:12.225
And we need to get
these Talkers to Limbo.

42:12.268 --> 42:15.533
I've got some questions
for Roman Estes.

42:17.012 --> 42:19.449
That's gonna be a problem
to get to him.

42:19.493 --> 42:22.191
I think I know some guys
that can get past Altura's

42:22.235 --> 42:24.759
high tech security system.

42:24.803 --> 42:25.543
Come on.

42:26.718 --> 42:27.893
Where we headed?

42:29.242 --> 42:30.765
Hacker town.
