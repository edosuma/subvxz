00:01.929 --> 00:03.680
Previously on Angel:

00:04.330 --> 00:06.429
- You Denver?
- No other cat but me.

00:06.730 --> 00:10.800
A vampire wants to slay a demon
to help grubby humans? I don't get it.

00:11.529 --> 00:14.369
There's a hotel here
full of tortured souls...

00:15.130 --> 00:16.949
...who need your help.

00:18.129 --> 00:19.179
Take them all.

00:19.929 --> 00:23.829
I'm trying to atone for 100 years
of unthinkable evil. I never can.

00:24.730 --> 00:27.539
Never enough. Now I got
Wolfram & Hart dogging me.

00:27.730 --> 00:31.239
You've done stellar work.
The senior partners noticed.

00:31.929 --> 00:33.609
Darla had a shot at redemption,
but they took it.

00:34.329 --> 00:35.700
For God's sake, help us.

00:36.130 --> 00:39.039
- People will die.
- I just can't seem to care.

00:40.929 --> 00:42.890
Officer, wait! This man is--

00:43.890 --> 00:46.520
You learn to live with many things,
don't you?

00:46.649 --> 00:49.350
- This job is making me crazy.
- I know the feeling.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074

01:55.049 --> 01:57.859
- What's next?
- "Be sure all troughs are fastened...

01:58.049 --> 02:00.890
...and sacrifices tilted
as in diagram F-12...

02:01.650 --> 02:05.579
- ...for drainage into sacred bowl."
- Yes, yes. And?

02:06.450 --> 02:09.780
"Using a diagonal motion,
slit throat of sacrifice...

02:10.650 --> 02:13.490
...with the pre-blessed
ceremonial dagger provided."

02:13.650 --> 02:16.419
- It didn't see it.
- Look under the packing. Hurry.

02:17.250 --> 02:19.879
- It's not in here.
- Just give me the knife.

02:20.250 --> 02:21.719
You know....

02:25.650 --> 02:28.770
I, well, couldn't help but
notice the goats.

02:31.050 --> 02:33.819
Yeah, lot of goats.

02:34.650 --> 02:37.979
Goats, many. Those goats, guys--

02:38.250 --> 02:39.759
That's our pre-blessed--

02:40.650 --> 02:41.659
Ceremonial dagger?

02:41.849 --> 02:44.060
So sue me.
Or have your bosses do it.

02:44.250 --> 02:46.879
This building's owned by
Wolfram & Hart, right?

02:47.849 --> 02:48.719
What do you want?

02:49.050 --> 02:51.789
I wanna know what they're
having you worship.

02:52.050 --> 02:54.610
None of your business.
Who are you?

02:55.650 --> 02:56.560
Me?

02:57.849 --> 03:00.590
The type who hates to see
good blood go to waste.

03:00.849 --> 03:04.150
We just get paid to do the
slaughtering and say the prayer.

03:05.050 --> 03:06.240
- Praying to what?
- I don't know!

03:06.250 --> 03:08.849
- How can you not know?
- The ritual, it's in Latin.

03:09.849 --> 03:13.039
They said we should just sound it out.

03:13.449 --> 03:15.800
- They?
- Like you said, Wolfram & Hart.

03:16.449 --> 03:20.349
It has to be done by midnight,
or something will be pissed off.

03:23.650 --> 03:24.659
Good.

04:25.009 --> 04:27.889
- I don't see anything.
- Not a trace.

04:28.290 --> 04:32.610
At school the kids'll never notice
that a third eye was growing there.

04:33.689 --> 04:36.430
- This will come back in soon.
- What?

04:36.689 --> 04:39.709
The hair. I meant the hair...

04:40.290 --> 04:42.889
...that was in the back--

04:43.889 --> 04:46.519
Not the third eye,
'cause that won't come back.

04:48.089 --> 04:50.259
- Right?
- No reason it should.

04:50.490 --> 04:53.720
The curative charm seems to have
worked like a charm.

04:54.410 --> 04:56.269
- We can't thank you.
- Don't worry.

04:56.810 --> 04:57.680
It's what we do.

04:58.009 --> 05:01.379
- Kind of a mission.
- No, I mean we can't thank you.

05:02.209 --> 05:03.959
And we can't pay you either.

05:04.610 --> 05:06.540
This bill, it's ridiculous.

05:07.009 --> 05:09.850
What? We didn't even
charge you for the mandrake.

05:10.610 --> 05:13.379
- My husband says it's outrageous.
- Does he?

05:13.610 --> 05:16.069
What would your husband
consider a fair price...

05:16.610 --> 05:20.370
...for the removal of the third eye
from the back of your child's head?

05:21.410 --> 05:23.269
Well, nothing.

05:23.810 --> 05:27.569
Steve says one can't be bitten
by a demon and have a third eye...

05:28.009 --> 05:32.050
...grow on the back of one's head,
so you're runn;ng a scam.

05:32.810 --> 05:35.649
And you won't squeeze
one red cent out of us.

05:36.410 --> 05:38.019
- Come on, Stephanie.
- Scam?

05:38.810 --> 05:41.129
The back of your kid's head
was blinking!

05:41.209 --> 05:42.959
No, let her go.

05:43.610 --> 05:47.300
It's easier for the Sharps to call us
con artists than to accept...

05:47.810 --> 05:51.600
...that Skilosh spawn nearly hatched
out of their child's skull.

05:52.610 --> 05:53.839
- Gee, wonder why?
- Great.

05:53.810 --> 05:57.430
While they're indulging their denial,
we have bills to pay.

05:59.209 --> 06:00.399
You know, she's right.

06:01.009 --> 06:03.180
Maybe the Sharps will come round.

06:04.009 --> 06:06.180
Right. People come round.

06:06.410 --> 06:08.759
- Where are you going?
- To see what's up in the hood.

06:09.410 --> 06:11.660
I'll do more good there
than here with you two.

06:12.050 --> 06:15.170
- Things will pick up. They're bound to.
- It's L.A.

06:15.649 --> 06:17.750
The evil's probably tied
up in traffic.

06:18.649 --> 06:22.089
You'll let me know
when it gets here, right?

06:31.649 --> 06:34.069
I've been looking for you.
Where are you going?

06:34.649 --> 06:36.790
- Lunch.
- You think now is the time for lunch?

06:37.649 --> 06:38.560
You mean lunchtime?

06:38.850 --> 06:40.709
- The review's in two days.
- I'm aware.

06:41.250 --> 06:43.779
So is everyone else.
They've had the fear of--

06:44.250 --> 06:46.250
"God" would be the wrong word.

06:46.649 --> 06:48.509
- They're just scared.
- They should be.

06:49.050 --> 06:52.000
I dug up everything
on the last 75-year review.

06:52.649 --> 06:55.279
It makes the Christmas purge
of '68 seem fun.

06:55.649 --> 06:58.769
Half of mid-management was sacked.
They used actual sacks.

06:59.250 --> 07:02.579
- I'll read it, Lilah.
- You better. My ass is on the line too.

07:03.449 --> 07:05.910
We're supposed to be
running this together.

07:06.449 --> 07:09.569
I suggested how to plump up
our portfolios by Friday.

07:10.050 --> 07:12.300
Either we pass the review or we won't.

07:13.050 --> 07:16.170
You think a few dark rites and
rituals will make a difference?

07:16.649 --> 07:18.120
Everyone else thinks so.

07:18.449 --> 07:22.560
Henderson pulled her first-born out of
company daycare to offer it up to....

07:23.250 --> 07:26.089
Brownnoser. Mom was right.
I should've had children.

07:26.850 --> 07:29.480
- We'll stand on our record.
- Then we're dead.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.779
Remember our collective screwups?

07:32.250 --> 07:34.949
Two of them are still
out there somewhere.

07:35.850 --> 07:38.480
You'd tell me if they
contacted you, right?

07:38.850 --> 07:40.500
He set them on fire, Lilah.

07:41.250 --> 07:44.129
Even vampires need time
to recover from that.

07:44.250 --> 07:46.740
- It'd be like them to pop up now.
- Don't worry.

07:47.850 --> 07:50.730
Someone's got to.
We don't get a second shot at this.

07:50.850 --> 07:54.360
Nothing can happen between now and
Friday to screw this up.

07:55.050 --> 07:57.439
Blood sacrifices,
black masses, totems....

07:58.050 --> 08:01.910
What does it mean? It's all over.
It could be a raising, but I don't....

08:02.850 --> 08:06.399
The prayers, the rituals,
they're too generic. Boilerplate.

08:07.050 --> 08:09.959
- Are they summoning something?
- Or trying to make it rain.

08:10.649 --> 08:12.750
Why is this so important to you?

08:16.050 --> 08:19.629
- Because it's important to them.
- Therefore it must be stopped.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.569
I need you.
I don't have the resources.

08:23.250 --> 08:24.829
- You need my help?
- Yeah--

08:28.050 --> 08:30.509
Get them for butchering animals
without a permit.

08:31.050 --> 08:35.019
I can't do anything. I'm on
desk duty till Friday's hearing.

08:35.850 --> 08:36.720
Hearing?

08:37.049 --> 08:39.259
Remember Atkinson,
the captain at the two-three?

08:40.049 --> 08:42.259
He's blaming me for
letting in a lunatic...

08:42.450 --> 08:45.190
...who broke into his office
and beat him up.

08:46.049 --> 08:47.350
He's filed a complaint.

08:47.850 --> 08:51.009
He raised zombie cops and
released them in the streets.

08:51.450 --> 08:54.960
Once I explain that to
Internal Affairs, this'll go away.

08:55.649 --> 08:58.700
They've just been
looking for an excuse.

08:59.250 --> 09:01.460
You know what they say about me.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.970
I'm a cop.
That's all I've ever--

09:04.049 --> 09:06.750
I can't take a suspension.
I would just--

09:13.649 --> 09:14.909
I'm sorry.

09:15.450 --> 09:16.320
Are you?

09:19.649 --> 09:22.389
Because they might want
to know about this too.

09:28.049 --> 09:29.419
You'd nothing to do with that.

09:30.450 --> 09:32.769
- Didn't I?
- No.

09:32.850 --> 09:36.110
These dead people were threatened
by an intruder at their offices...

09:37.049 --> 09:39.220
...whom I picked up
and released three hours...

09:39.450 --> 09:41.100
...before they were massacred.

09:41.850 --> 09:44.169
- You know who's responsible for that.
- Yes.

09:44.850 --> 09:47.200
But why is Forensics saying
it looks like...

09:47.850 --> 09:50.519
...the suspect or suspects
didn't break in?

09:51.450 --> 09:52.710
They had to break out.

09:53.250 --> 09:55.950
The victims were locked in
with their attackers.

09:56.850 --> 09:58.809
I am done helping you now.

10:09.129 --> 10:10.740
Sorry I'm late.

10:11.529 --> 10:13.179
I'd come home for lunch...

10:13.929 --> 10:17.480
...but it's crazy at the office,
with the review coming up.

10:22.929 --> 10:26.690
I didn't call, so you wouldn't
have to get up. How do you feel?

10:27.730 --> 10:29.690
Stronger today, I guess.

10:30.129 --> 10:32.019
Good. You're stronger every day.

10:32.529 --> 10:35.440
Only because you saved me.

10:36.129 --> 10:38.620
I'd still be in that sewer
if you hadn't found me.

10:39.129 --> 10:41.299
I don't know how you did it.

10:42.730 --> 10:45.289
Drusilla. She came to me.

10:45.730 --> 10:46.960
Remember? I told you.

10:48.730 --> 10:49.809
She's gone.

10:49.929 --> 10:52.179
- She'll be back.
- No.

10:55.330 --> 10:57.929
You're the only one
who hasn't abandoned me.

10:58.330 --> 10:59.559
And I never will.

11:07.929 --> 11:08.909
Here.

11:15.730 --> 11:17.409
It's cold.

11:17.529 --> 11:19.279
It's the only way to keep it fresh.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.789
Not the only way.

11:23.529 --> 11:25.389
At least it's human.

11:27.730 --> 11:29.059
I'm gonna go shower.

11:29.529 --> 11:33.850
You always shower when you come back
from that place. Don't know why.

11:34.929 --> 11:36.299
You're never dirty.

11:37.330 --> 11:38.730
I'm always dirty.

12:05.649 --> 12:08.980
I don't care, substitute it with
something. Be creative.

12:09.250 --> 12:11.570
Not even 10:00, and
we're out of yak's bile.

12:12.250 --> 12:14.919
- We gotta talk.
- You should've booked in advance.

12:15.250 --> 12:17.740
- You can't go onstage tonight.
- I'm not here to sing.

12:18.250 --> 12:20.600
- That's what we call it now?
- Something's coming.

12:21.250 --> 12:22.159
Really?

12:22.450 --> 12:26.450
I thought it was the nachos bringing
in the morally ambiguous crowd.

12:29.649 --> 12:31.230
Lawyers.

12:32.649 --> 12:34.610
Easy. I know what you're thinking.

12:35.049 --> 12:38.350
The throwing-yourself-over-tables-
twisting-their-heads-off part?

12:39.250 --> 12:40.090
Not a good idea.

12:40.450 --> 12:42.379
You've seen.
You know what's coming.

12:42.850 --> 12:45.659
You wouldn't like it
if I blabbed your personal stuff...

12:46.450 --> 12:49.259
...to every Tom, Dick
and vampire that walked in.

12:49.450 --> 12:50.960
Is it bad?

12:52.450 --> 12:56.000
I can't divulge to you
what I read in another being.

12:56.649 --> 12:58.720
But I heard something
in the men's restroom.

12:59.649 --> 13:03.090
It's coming Friday.
It's got their legal briefs in a twist.

13:03.850 --> 13:05.149
What?

13:05.649 --> 13:09.580
Every 75 years, your friends at
Wolfram & Hart have a review.

13:09.850 --> 13:13.539
The angst is not about the review,
but more about the reviewer.

13:14.649 --> 13:17.980
- And let's just say it ain't Rex Reed.
- What is it?

13:18.250 --> 13:19.789
It's evil.

13:20.649 --> 13:23.700
It's dark. It's merciless.

13:24.250 --> 13:26.919
Actually, it sounds a lot
like Rex, doesn't it?

13:27.250 --> 13:29.570
Just tell me in one word what it is.

13:31.450 --> 13:34.539
Not likely.
But I can tell you in two.

13:36.250 --> 13:38.070
Senior partner.

13:53.090 --> 13:55.759
- I need more. More information.
- We all need more.

13:56.690 --> 13:59.009
You need more tether,
'cause you're at the end of it.

13:59.090 --> 14:02.110
I get this. I'm not asking
you to rat out their destinies.

14:02.690 --> 14:05.289
- These senior partners are my destiny.
- Are they?

14:06.289 --> 14:09.909
I haven't seen a destiny with you
in it lately. It's all kind of murky.

14:11.090 --> 14:14.570
These messy rites and rituals
you've crashed all over town...

14:15.289 --> 14:17.610
...they mean nothing.
Nervous children...

14:17.690 --> 14:20.149
...trying to score points
before Daddy gets home.

14:20.690 --> 14:23.600
I got news.
Daddy? Not impressed.

14:24.889 --> 14:29.139
Stopping those won't prevent it
from passing into our world Friday.

14:30.289 --> 14:33.029
- What is "it" and how do I stop it?
- I don't know.

14:33.289 --> 14:34.159
Can it be killed?

14:34.490 --> 14:37.610
Most anything in this dimension
can be killed.

14:38.690 --> 14:40.509
A downside of being here.

14:40.490 --> 14:43.929
That and the so-called musicals of
Andrew Lloyd Webber.

14:48.889 --> 14:51.419
"The Band of Blacknil."
I don't know what it means.

14:51.889 --> 14:54.700
- I shouldn't even give you that much.
- Thanks.

14:55.490 --> 14:56.649
"Home Office."

14:56.690 --> 14:58.830
Picked it up from them tonight.

14:59.690 --> 15:02.320
- What does it mean?
- Maybe the source. Who knows?

15:02.690 --> 15:03.740
Stop pestering me.

15:05.690 --> 15:07.860
I am picking up one other thing.

15:08.690 --> 15:10.720
They'd really like to see you dead.

15:53.090 --> 15:54.600
- Good Lord.
- Angel?

15:54.889 --> 15:56.080
May we help you?

15:57.889 --> 16:00.840
Excuse me, that area is for
employees only.

16:01.490 --> 16:04.049
- You took the books.
- You got the waffle iron.

16:05.090 --> 16:06.809
Hey, no!

16:07.490 --> 16:10.649
Not that one.
I'm in the middle of it. Take this.

16:11.090 --> 16:12.809
Don't make me move you.

16:13.490 --> 16:15.169
Give him the book, Cordelia.

16:17.090 --> 16:19.580
Just give him the damn thing!

16:20.090 --> 16:21.389
Let him get the hell out.

16:26.090 --> 16:27.350
Here.

16:27.889 --> 16:31.889
- I don't even know what you are.
- I'm a vampire. Look it up.

16:35.690 --> 16:36.879
What a jerk.

16:36.889 --> 16:37.970
Cordelia....

16:38.690 --> 16:41.179
Anybody else,
I'd say get laid, already.

16:41.690 --> 16:44.850
- Cordelia....
- But no, not him.

16:45.289 --> 16:49.610
One decent boff, and he switches
to evil psycho-vamp.

16:50.690 --> 16:53.919
Which would be better for everyone.
Him, 'cause he'd get some.

16:54.289 --> 16:57.200
Us, because then we could
stake him after.

16:57.889 --> 16:59.850
Cordelia, ambulance.

17:02.690 --> 17:03.740
Oh, my God!

17:05.650 --> 17:09.509
If you have anything to offer in your
defense, anything at all...

17:10.450 --> 17:11.960
...now would be the time.

17:15.250 --> 17:18.660
- For God's sake, say something.
- What am I supposed to say?

17:19.450 --> 17:21.519
They've dredged out every ugly detail.

17:21.848 --> 17:25.990
It's as if nothing had a context,
and I'm supposed to explain?

17:27.250 --> 17:29.039
I was doing my job.

17:29.650 --> 17:32.740
Actually, you've been
isolating yourself.

17:33.250 --> 17:36.579
You've withdrawn
from your fellow officers...

17:37.450 --> 17:40.930
...developed a fascination with
bizarre and macabre cases.

17:41.650 --> 17:45.059
Even you can't seem to give an
explanation as to why.

17:45.849 --> 17:49.920
Now your father, he was a respected
veteran of this department.

17:50.650 --> 17:54.059
You discovered his body after he was
murdered, is that right?

17:54.849 --> 17:56.180
Yes.

17:56.650 --> 17:58.720
And the case was never solved?

17:59.049 --> 18:00.940
No arrests have ever been made.

18:02.049 --> 18:04.150
That must be frustrating for you.

18:05.650 --> 18:08.250
- I dealt with it.
- Did you?

18:08.650 --> 18:12.690
You took no time off after his death.
You went right back on the job.

18:13.450 --> 18:17.210
- That's not your business.
- It is when it affects performance.

18:18.250 --> 18:21.369
It is important when we
suffer a loss of this nature...

18:21.849 --> 18:23.849
...to take proper time to grieve.

18:24.250 --> 18:25.549
So we understand.

18:26.049 --> 18:28.609
- We're not judging you.
- No, you're just firing me.

18:29.049 --> 18:31.650
- You stopped being part of the force.
- What do I do?

18:32.650 --> 18:35.880
We will make available to you
psychological counseling...

18:36.250 --> 18:39.869
...at the city's expense,
as part of your severance.

18:42.250 --> 18:45.230
You have no idea what is going on
in this city.

18:45.849 --> 18:48.589
Is this where you start
talking about monsters?

18:51.250 --> 18:53.809
We'll need your gun and your badge.

19:14.049 --> 19:16.470
I'm glad your father's
not here to see this.

19:26.210 --> 19:27.859
You Denver?

19:29.809 --> 19:31.910
I don't believe it.

19:32.809 --> 19:35.269
You know, you changed
my life that day.

19:35.809 --> 19:37.880
A vampire comes into my place...

19:38.210 --> 19:41.089
...looking to kill a demon
to save human beings?

19:41.809 --> 19:45.220
If that can happen,
there must be good in the world.

19:45.410 --> 19:47.339
You've never heard of
Home Office?

19:47.809 --> 19:51.599
How'd that go? It was a Thesulac.
Paranoia demon, if I recall.

19:52.609 --> 19:55.490
I don't know.
I think it killed everyone there.

19:58.009 --> 19:59.690
The point is, you tried.

20:00.410 --> 20:03.710
I walked out and let him have
the place and everyone in it.

20:04.609 --> 20:06.430
We don't know where
the Home Office is...

20:06.410 --> 20:09.079
...but you think the senior partner
is a Kleynach demon?

20:10.009 --> 20:12.150
Right. Kleynach.

20:14.809 --> 20:17.509
Many dark entities use the form
of a Kleynach to manifest.

20:17.809 --> 20:20.480
A Kleynach doesn't have to
rely on being conjured.

20:21.410 --> 20:23.369
They can come and go with that ring.

20:23.809 --> 20:26.509
- Tell me about the ring.
- The Band of Blacknil.

20:26.809 --> 20:29.829
Simple thing. Plain.
You wouldn't notice it in a pawn shop.

20:30.410 --> 20:32.690
But it's used to move
between the dimensions.

20:33.410 --> 20:37.410
And that's what it'll use to get here.
And get back.

20:38.210 --> 20:39.750
- Get back?
- Well, sure.

20:41.210 --> 20:42.789
- Can anyone use the ring?
- Say again?

20:43.009 --> 20:45.680
Will it take me back
to the Home Office?

20:46.009 --> 20:48.569
Might. If you're insane.

20:49.009 --> 20:51.920
You realize what this
Home Office probably is?

20:52.609 --> 20:54.680
- I think I have an idea.
- Hell.

20:55.609 --> 20:58.309
Why the heck do you
want to go to Hell?

20:59.809 --> 21:03.809
You're gonna go down there and
destroy the whole lot of them!

21:04.609 --> 21:07.769
That'd certainly make up
for the time that you--

21:09.410 --> 21:12.109
Still, not a terrific idea.
Suicide, really.

21:13.009 --> 21:16.420
- Will the ring get me there?
- You gotta get it first.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.609
To get the ring, you gotta
kill the Kleynach.

21:19.609 --> 21:20.869
How?

21:20.809 --> 21:22.910
I'm the one guy who can tell you.

21:23.809 --> 21:25.039
How?

21:27.410 --> 21:30.640
To kill the Kleynach
and get the ring...

21:31.009 --> 21:33.819
- ...you need the glove.
- You're making this up.

21:34.609 --> 21:37.380
Legend says the Kleynach rose
from their demon world...

21:38.210 --> 21:40.630
...raped and pillaged
the villages of man.

21:41.210 --> 21:43.460
All who fought them
were incinerated...

21:43.609 --> 21:46.029
...whether they struck
with fist or sword.

21:46.609 --> 21:50.160
But one brave and worthy knight,
he had a glove...

21:50.809 --> 21:54.390
...fashioned and blessed
by all the Powers of Light.

21:55.009 --> 21:59.890
Whoever wore the glove could kill the
Kleynach by grabbing it at the throat.

22:01.009 --> 22:05.220
Picked it up in '75 at a yard sale in
Covina. Been using it as an oven mitt.

22:05.809 --> 22:08.089
And now I give it to you. No charge.

22:08.809 --> 22:11.230
Because the truth is,
you did change my life.

22:11.809 --> 22:14.759
And I got a feeling this time,
things are gonna go--

22:16.609 --> 22:17.519
Better.

22:20.809 --> 22:23.970
That's right, Angelus.
Go towards the bleeding mortal.

22:25.009 --> 22:27.259
Because that's smart.

22:31.609 --> 22:34.170
The ring's not about
vengeance, Angelus.

22:34.609 --> 22:36.890
It's about power.

22:37.009 --> 22:39.150
We'll get to the vengeance part soon.

22:58.890 --> 23:01.349
I stood up to him.
That's the important thing.

23:01.890 --> 23:03.710
You couldn't do it metaphorically?

23:04.289 --> 23:05.619
With a stern word?

23:06.089 --> 23:10.410
You had to do it in the "I'm standing
Up now and popping 6 stitches" way?

23:12.690 --> 23:16.339
Before all this happened
I never really considered...

23:17.490 --> 23:19.140
...how dangerous your work was.

23:19.289 --> 23:21.460
Of course it's dangerous.
Remember how we met?

23:21.690 --> 23:23.200
You were strapped to an altar...

23:24.089 --> 23:27.880
...while the goddess Yeskah was
called forth to consume you.

23:28.289 --> 23:30.390
But I grew up with that sort of stuff.

23:31.890 --> 23:34.700
Creepy-crawlies and scary monsters
I can handle.

23:34.890 --> 23:36.920
But guns?

23:37.890 --> 23:40.660
Kind of makes it all
a little too real.

23:42.089 --> 23:45.069
The gun was fired by a zombie,
if it makes you feel better.

23:45.690 --> 23:48.009
You know, strangely, it doesn't.

23:57.690 --> 23:58.490
Ooh.

24:04.289 --> 24:07.480
Does it always seem like
it's a battle worth fighting?

24:09.690 --> 24:11.759
Some less than others.

24:12.690 --> 24:14.759
Collectively, I mean.

24:15.089 --> 24:18.920
Most people don't even acknowledge
the evil, let alone fight it.

24:20.490 --> 24:24.809
They don't have to use bandages to
keep their insides from falling out.

24:28.289 --> 24:29.730
That's true.

24:31.890 --> 24:36.210
I don't suppose you'd ever consider
maybe giving it up...

24:36.690 --> 24:38.089
...for something else?

24:39.089 --> 24:41.259
Could you be with someone who would?

24:42.690 --> 24:44.759
I don't know.

24:45.089 --> 24:48.210
Sometimes I feel like
I should be wrapped in bandages...

24:49.289 --> 24:51.920
...to keep my insides
from falling out.

25:00.690 --> 25:03.150
This is difficult for you, isn't it?

25:04.890 --> 25:07.589
- I just don't like to see you hurt.
- No.

25:13.289 --> 25:15.250
I mean breaking up with me.

26:36.250 --> 26:38.500
You two stick close.

26:49.650 --> 26:52.250
Crap! I knew you guys were
a waste of money.

26:53.049 --> 26:55.930
You're not parking in the
underground lot anymore.

26:56.650 --> 26:59.140
It's not safe.
What do you want?

26:59.650 --> 27:03.579
I want the same thing from you
that I took from Lindsey.

27:05.650 --> 27:09.059
- Hello, Ms, Morgan, Which floor?
- Fifteen.

27:09.849 --> 27:12.759
You'll lead security all over
the moment you step inside.

27:13.450 --> 27:15.240
Yeah, I'm counting on it.

27:26.049 --> 27:27.130
Good evening.

27:27.849 --> 27:30.759
Angphlmn Investigations. We help
the helpless. How can we help you?

27:31.450 --> 27:32.990
What is "Angphlmn"?

27:33.250 --> 27:35.809
There are some names
I'm not saying at the moment.

27:36.250 --> 27:37.160
What is it, Wesley?

27:37.450 --> 27:41.000
I just....
I'm not really feeling that great.

27:41.650 --> 27:44.769
Oh, well, your guts opened up.

27:45.849 --> 27:48.690
- Maybe I won't come in tomorrow.
- That's okay,

27:48.849 --> 27:52.359
It's not like they're beating down
the door. Stay home.

27:53.049 --> 27:55.119
Spend time with Virginia,

27:56.650 --> 27:57.519
Yes.

27:57.849 --> 28:00.730
And you, you should get out yourself.

28:01.450 --> 28:03.940
You're young, single,
It's a Friday night...

28:04.450 --> 28:07.539
...in the City of "Angphlmns."

28:08.049 --> 28:12.369
- There must be someone you can call,
- No, then I'd have friends.

28:13.450 --> 28:14.819
I don't.

28:17.049 --> 28:19.119
That's not true.

28:20.049 --> 28:21.730
You don't count.

28:23.049 --> 28:24.099
Thank you.

28:24.250 --> 28:26.640
You know what I mean,

28:30.250 --> 28:33.759
Things are going to get better,
Cordelia. For all of us.

28:34.450 --> 28:35.819
You'll see,

28:37.450 --> 28:40.220
I'll call you tomorrow.
See how you're feeling.

28:41.049 --> 28:42.769
That'd be nice.

28:43.450 --> 28:46.329
- Good night, Wesley,
- Good night.

28:52.450 --> 28:56.490
Oh, jeez, Wesley,
lip-a-dee doo-dah, all right?

28:57.250 --> 28:59.779
- Hello?
- Ms. Chase?

29:00.250 --> 29:01.440
Oh. Mrs. Sharp!

29:02.049 --> 29:04.299
We were hoping you'd still be
in the office.

29:05.049 --> 29:07.890
The back of your daughter's head
is still okay, right?

29:08.049 --> 29:12.369
We don't offer a money-back guarantee.
But you never paid, did you?

29:13.450 --> 29:15.099
You do? Right now?

29:15.849 --> 29:17.220
No, that's great!

29:17.650 --> 29:20.670
You're on my way home,
give or take 30 miles.

29:21.250 --> 29:23.809
Personal check?

29:24.250 --> 29:27.339
Normally not, but fine.

29:27.849 --> 29:29.990
Will you give me the address again?

29:33.250 --> 29:35.740
Okay, great. I'll see you soon.

29:42.250 --> 29:44.990
One of them is on their way here now.

30:06.210 --> 30:09.720
I don't see your co-vice president.
It doesn't look good.

30:10.410 --> 30:11.809
Yes, sir.

30:16.410 --> 30:18.690
Well, find it. Deal with it.

30:20.609 --> 30:21.619
Is there a problem?

30:22.410 --> 30:24.759
Someone just let a vampire
onto this floor.

30:41.609 --> 30:42.769
There!

30:45.809 --> 30:46.789
Security!

31:07.609 --> 31:08.619
Vampire!

31:38.210 --> 31:40.069
Stake the bitch.

32:22.049 --> 32:23.130
Okay.

32:23.250 --> 32:25.000
Home Office.

32:28.049 --> 32:29.769
Let's finish this.

32:56.450 --> 33:00.170
Congratulations. Great victory.

33:01.849 --> 33:03.880
- You're--
- Holland Manners.

33:04.849 --> 33:05.970
Not alive.

33:06.049 --> 33:08.299
Oh, no. I'm quite dead.

33:09.049 --> 33:13.369
Unfortunately my contract with Wolfram
& Hart extends well beyond that.

33:15.650 --> 33:17.970
Hop on in. You've certainly earned it.

33:25.250 --> 33:27.500
No, not a ghost either.

33:27.650 --> 33:31.579
It's just me. Dead me. See?

33:33.650 --> 33:34.809
Home Office, wasn't it?

33:36.650 --> 33:38.900
I should mention the trip is one-way.

33:42.049 --> 33:46.369
If there are no objections, I suggest
we get going. It's a long ride.

33:56.450 --> 34:00.519
This is exciting, isn't it?
Going straight to the source.

34:03.650 --> 34:06.039
So, what's the big plan, Angel?

34:06.650 --> 34:08.579
Destroy the senior partners?

34:09.050 --> 34:12.420
- Smash Wolfram & Hart forever?
- Something like that.

34:14.449 --> 34:18.768
Just what do you imagine that will
accomplish? In the end, I mean?

34:19.250 --> 34:22.409
- It'll be the end.
- The end of you, certainly.

34:22.849 --> 34:24.710
But I meant in the larger sense.

34:25.250 --> 34:28.480
In the larger sense,
I really don't give a crap.

34:29.449 --> 34:31.030
Now, I don't think that's true.

34:32.449 --> 34:33.530
Be honest.

34:34.849 --> 34:37.480
You've got a tiny bit
of "give a crap" left...

34:38.449 --> 34:40.768
...or you wouldn't be on this mission.

34:40.849 --> 34:43.659
Now, there was something
in a sacred prophecy.

34:44.449 --> 34:46.030
Some oblique reference to you.

34:46.250 --> 34:49.480
Something you're supposed to prevent.
What was that?

34:50.449 --> 34:54.099
- The Apocalypse.
- Yes, the Apocalypse, of course.

34:54.650 --> 34:56.159
Another one of those.

34:56.449 --> 34:59.820
Well, it's true,
we do have one scheduled.

35:00.650 --> 35:03.909
If you were to prevent it,
you'd save many people.

35:04.849 --> 35:08.889
You should do that, then.
Absolutely. I wasn't thinking.

35:09.650 --> 35:13.440
Those people you save from that
Apocalypse would await the next one.

35:14.449 --> 35:17.639
But, hey, it's always something,
isn't it?

35:22.849 --> 35:23.969
You're not gonna win.

35:25.849 --> 35:29.400
Well, no, of course we aren't.

35:30.050 --> 35:34.050
We have no intention of doing anything
so prosa;c as w;nn;ng.

35:39.650 --> 35:41.900
- Then why?
- I'm sorry. Why what?

35:42.650 --> 35:43.880
Why fight?

35:44.449 --> 35:47.820
That's the question
you should be asking yourself.

35:48.650 --> 35:52.019
For us, there is no fight.
Winning doesn't enter into it.

35:52.849 --> 35:56.610
We go on, no matter what.

35:57.050 --> 36:00.670
Our firm has always been here,
in one form or another.

36:01.250 --> 36:04.159
Inquisition. Khmer Rouge.

36:04.849 --> 36:08.360
We were there when the first
caveman clubbed his neighbor.

36:09.050 --> 36:11.860
We're in the hearts and minds
of every living being.

36:12.650 --> 36:15.179
And that, friend...

36:15.650 --> 36:18.110
...is making things
difficult for you.

36:18.650 --> 36:21.489
The world doesn't work
in spite of evil, Angel.

36:22.250 --> 36:24.039
It works with us.

36:24.650 --> 36:26.820
It works because of us.

36:38.170 --> 36:40.340
Welcome to the Home Office.

36:41.769 --> 36:43.099
This isn't....

36:43.570 --> 36:45.820
Well, you know it is.

36:46.570 --> 36:48.360
You know that better than anyone.

36:48.969 --> 36:53.289
The things you've seen.
The things you've, well, done.

36:57.369 --> 37:00.250
If there wasn't evil
in all of them out there...

37:00.369 --> 37:03.280
...why, they wouldn't be people.

37:05.769 --> 37:07.730
They'd all be angels.

37:16.570 --> 37:18.289
Have a nice day.

38:32.170 --> 38:35.329
You've reached Angel
Investigations, We help the hopeless,

38:36.369 --> 38:39.250
leave a message and we'll get
right back to you,

38:40.570 --> 38:42.739
You did it, didn't you, you bastard?

38:47.170 --> 38:49.030
You made me trust you.

38:50.769 --> 38:52.659
You made me believe.

38:54.369 --> 38:56.400
No, it wasn't you.

38:56.769 --> 38:58.349
It was me, right?

38:58.570 --> 39:00.360
I couldn't take the heat.

39:00.969 --> 39:03.139
That's what they're gonna say,

39:03.369 --> 39:06.989
And you're gonna feel all bad,
or you won 't care,

39:08.170 --> 39:09.820
But I won't care either,

39:10.570 --> 39:12.460
I won't feel a thing,

39:27.769 --> 39:29.559
What do you want, Darla?

39:33.170 --> 39:34.750
You want this?

39:42.170 --> 39:44.869
Or maybe what you really want is this.

39:48.050 --> 39:51.949
Maybe what you really want...

39:52.250 --> 39:53.719
...is this.

40:07.250 --> 40:08.719
Don't play games with me.

40:09.050 --> 40:13.119
I'm not playing. I just wanna feel
something besides the cold.

40:26.449 --> 40:28.099
Why are you laughing?

40:37.250 --> 40:39.280
Don't you feel the cold?

40:43.849 --> 40:45.250
What are you doing?

40:45.650 --> 40:47.159
It doesn't matter.

40:49.849 --> 40:51.599
None of it matters.

42:32.570 --> 42:33.550
Thank you,
