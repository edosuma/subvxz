WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:02.770
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Okay, where to begin?

00:02.803 --> 00:05.073
After being engaged
 and then broken up,

00:05.106 --> 00:06.274
Jane and Michael are finally

00:06.307 --> 00:07.275
back together.

00:07.308 --> 00:09.043
Not as thrilled?

00:09.077 --> 00:10.111
Jane's baby daddy/
 former boyfriend

00:10.144 --> 00:12.780
Rafael, but that was over.

00:12.813 --> 00:15.783
My feelings changed and
that's why we aren't together.

00:15.816 --> 00:18.152
And he did say he'd try
 to get on board with Michael.

00:18.186 --> 00:20.754
Complicating everything?
 His ex-wife Petra.

00:20.788 --> 00:23.191
See, she impregnated herself
 with Rafael's sperm.

00:23.224 --> 00:25.693
And she was expecting twins!
 Oh, and did I mention

00:25.726 --> 00:27.228
Rafael recently got back
 in touch with his mother?

00:27.261 --> 00:29.463
You actually have
a half brother.

00:29.497 --> 00:31.532
Oh, and turns out
 she's a crime lord.

00:31.565 --> 00:34.202
It's her!
 So, yeah, tough times
 for the Rafster.

00:34.235 --> 00:37.305
Also going through
 tough times-- Jane's father,

00:37.338 --> 00:39.307
international telenovela star
 Rogelio de la Vega.

00:39.340 --> 00:41.209
See, after he and Xo broke up,

00:41.242 --> 00:43.144
he and Jane got into a fight.

00:43.177 --> 00:45.313
I just think I need
some space right now.

00:45.346 --> 00:48.182
Even worse, he was kidnapped
 by his number-one fan/

00:48.216 --> 00:50.484
prison pen pal/new assistant!

00:50.518 --> 00:52.353
No one can ever get out.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.188
I know, bananas!

00:54.222 --> 00:56.557
So let's see what happens next.

00:56.590 --> 00:59.193
When Jane Gloriana Villanueva

00:59.227 --> 01:01.262
was 15 years old,
 she fell hard and fast

01:01.295 --> 01:04.298
for romance novels.

01:04.331 --> 01:06.334
(sultry music playing)

01:11.672 --> 01:13.407
(record scratches)

01:13.441 --> 01:16.110
What the...?

01:17.278 --> 01:19.113
(Alba clears throat)

01:21.915 --> 01:23.151
(sighs)

01:23.184 --> 01:24.485
Man, did Jane yearn

01:24.518 --> 01:26.554
to know what
 that black ink was hiding.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.289
It was as if her whole life

01:28.322 --> 01:30.558
were leading up
 to that revelation.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.793
Which brings us to last night,

01:32.826 --> 01:36.330
just after Jane and Michael's
 romance-novel-worthy kiss.

01:36.364 --> 01:37.598
Jane was ready.

01:37.631 --> 01:38.666
The time was right.

01:38.699 --> 01:40.268
What were they waiting for?

01:40.301 --> 01:42.370
And so they finally had sex.

01:43.804 --> 01:46.374
Lots and lots of sex.

01:48.242 --> 01:49.477
Just kidding.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.179
Geez, why are you all
 so obsessed

01:51.212 --> 01:53.347
with that anyway?
Oh.

01:53.381 --> 01:54.315
Here's what really happened.

01:54.348 --> 01:55.349
(exhales)

01:55.383 --> 01:56.617
We got to take a break.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.652
No, let's have sex.

01:58.686 --> 02:00.588
What?
I mean, I've been thinking
about it, and it was

02:00.621 --> 02:02.723
one thing to be a virgin when
marriage was on the horizon.

02:02.756 --> 02:04.358
But then we weren't together.

02:04.392 --> 02:05.693
And the finish line moved.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.261
And it seemed so far away!

02:07.295 --> 02:08.395
Closer now.

02:08.429 --> 02:09.330
Huh?

02:09.363 --> 02:10.497
The finish line.

02:10.531 --> 02:12.233
Because we're getting married.

02:12.266 --> 02:13.601
Oh...

02:13.634 --> 02:16.237
that's true.

02:16.270 --> 02:19.407
Yeah, and I wouldn't
even be waiting that long.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.842
Well, on the other hand,
what's the point of waiting

02:21.875 --> 02:24.278
if we're gonna
get married anyway, you know?

02:24.312 --> 02:26.714
Well, I mean,
I did want to wait.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.449
Yeah.
And if it's gonna be soon.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.850
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Bro!

02:29.883 --> 02:32.853
You just blocked yourself!

02:32.886 --> 02:34.722
Well, in that case,

02:34.755 --> 02:36.324
get ready to
be proposed to,

02:36.357 --> 02:37.391
because it's gonna
happen soon.

02:37.425 --> 02:40.261
Very soon.

02:40.294 --> 02:42.363
(laughing)

02:51.439 --> 02:54.308
And so Jane and Michael
 were back together.

02:54.342 --> 02:56.977
And in some ways,
 it felt just like old times.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.312
They ate Cubanos.

02:58.346 --> 02:59.380
Jane and Michael?

02:59.413 --> 03:01.315
You're back together?!

03:01.349 --> 03:03.384
They sent cute texts
 to each other.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.362
They caught up on Scandal.

03:14.395 --> 03:16.330
Honestly, I'm glad
Olivia's done with Fitz.

03:16.364 --> 03:19.367
Oh, my God, I knew it.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.569
You kept watching
without me.
No, I, no, I didn't...

03:21.602 --> 03:23.337
You did.
Some of the guys
from the office watch it.

03:23.371 --> 03:24.872
You're a total Gladiator,
admit it.
Uh-uh.

03:24.905 --> 03:25.873
Admit it.
Mm-mm.

03:25.906 --> 03:27.275
(Mateo crying)
Oh.

03:27.308 --> 03:28.409
But then again,

03:28.442 --> 03:29.810
some things were different

03:29.843 --> 03:31.279
because there was a baby.
(knocking)

03:31.312 --> 03:32.613
And a baby daddy.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.483
This seems like a good time

03:35.516 --> 03:37.351
to catch up on what Rafael
 has been up to

03:37.385 --> 03:39.019
these last ten days.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.522
He has, in fact,
 been having sex.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.891
Lots and lots of sex

03:43.924 --> 03:46.360
with a lot of different women.

03:46.394 --> 03:48.362
The exact number
 is not important.

03:48.396 --> 03:50.931
But all six encounters
 had one thing in common.

03:50.964 --> 03:52.666
Let's talk contraception.

03:52.700 --> 03:53.867
I probably can't have kids,

03:53.901 --> 03:54.868
but we still need
two different kinds.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.404
I've got the condoms.

03:56.437 --> 03:58.372
Then either the pill,
an IUD, the patch,

03:58.406 --> 04:01.008
the ring, the shot
or the sponge.

04:01.041 --> 04:03.611
Yes, Rafael had decided that
 instead of no sex and babies,

04:03.644 --> 04:05.813
he would try sex
 and no babies for a change.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.481
Sorry I'm late.

04:07.515 --> 04:09.450
I keep missing that
turn onto 3rd.

04:09.483 --> 04:12.320
You'll recall Rafael promised
 to try with Michael.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.388
Guess I need to give myself
some more time.

04:14.422 --> 04:16.490
Yeah, gets confusing.

04:16.524 --> 04:18.591
So here he is, trying.

04:18.625 --> 04:20.594
Don't worry, it took me a while
to figure out the neighborhood.

04:20.628 --> 04:23.497
And the traffic on the I-95
is the worst, so it's...

04:23.531 --> 04:26.967
In fact, I think it's safe
 to say that all three of them

04:27.000 --> 04:28.502
were finding this trying.

04:28.536 --> 04:30.504
So, I'll check in
with you later

04:30.538 --> 04:31.972
and just tell you
how he's doing.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.341
Great, yeah.

04:33.374 --> 04:34.808
Have a good time with Daddy.

04:34.842 --> 04:35.976
All right.

04:36.009 --> 04:37.945
See you two later.

04:37.978 --> 04:40.448
Mm-hmm.

04:44.084 --> 04:46.420
I just, huh...

04:47.655 --> 04:49.357
Did he seem okay to you?

04:49.390 --> 04:51.992
Yeah, yeah, he seemed, uh,
you know, normal.

04:52.025 --> 04:54.562
Like he was trying to be nice.

04:55.529 --> 04:57.831
Well, let's talk about it.

04:57.865 --> 04:59.900
No. (stammers)
I'm sorry.

04:59.933 --> 05:02.102
No, if you're,
if you're worried.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.404
I'm sure he's fine.

05:03.437 --> 05:05.473
In times like these,

05:05.506 --> 05:06.774
Jane couldn't help but imagine
 what could've been

05:06.807 --> 05:09.577
if she hadn't
 broken up with Michael

05:09.610 --> 05:11.445
all those months ago.

05:11.479 --> 05:12.780
The Sliding Doors version,

05:12.813 --> 05:14.448
as it were.

05:14.482 --> 05:15.616
Raf!
Hey!

05:15.649 --> 05:17.418
Hey!

05:17.451 --> 05:18.452
Oh, come on in.

05:18.486 --> 05:19.453
Hey, come to Daddy.

05:19.487 --> 05:20.788
Jane, Raf's here.

05:20.821 --> 05:21.889
Oh, my boy!

05:21.922 --> 05:23.457
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, how are you?

05:23.491 --> 05:25.459
Okay, now that I have
you two here,

05:25.493 --> 05:27.728
we need to start planning
Mateo's first birthday party.

05:27.761 --> 05:28.996
Really?
I mean, that's a
little early, Jane.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.063
Three months early.
Come on!

05:30.097 --> 05:31.064
No way, you two.

05:31.098 --> 05:32.132
Don't gang up on me.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.567
(both laughing)

05:33.601 --> 05:35.503
XIOMARA:
 Okay, it wouldn't be like that.

05:35.536 --> 05:36.804
Maybe not.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.472
But if I hadn't left
Michael back then,

05:38.506 --> 05:40.508
things would be
so much easier.

05:40.541 --> 05:44.545
And tomorrow would be our
first wedding anniversary.

05:44.578 --> 05:45.413
Really?

05:45.446 --> 05:47.448
(phone chimes)

05:49.550 --> 05:50.818
(sighs, chuckles)
What?

05:50.851 --> 05:52.586
Dad replied to my text.

05:53.987 --> 05:55.556
So immature.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.725
Did you see
his latest tweet?

06:02.863 --> 06:04.465
I'm getting pissed.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.033
I-I know that I
hurt his feelings.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.735
But you don't just detach
yourself from your family.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.437
There's no excuse for that!

06:09.470 --> 06:11.405
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 How about being held hostage

06:11.439 --> 06:13.574
by your old prison pen pal,

06:13.607 --> 06:15.743
who disguised herself
 as your assistant?

06:15.776 --> 06:18.579
Please, let's talk.
We will.

06:18.612 --> 06:19.680
Without the shackles!

06:19.713 --> 06:20.848
How can I trust you?

06:20.881 --> 06:22.850
First you stopped
writing to me.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.618
Then La Miseria stopped airing.

06:27.455 --> 06:28.956
I was your biggest fan!

06:28.989 --> 06:32.125
Okay, if there's any hope
of recapturing the magic,

06:32.159 --> 06:34.462
I can't be shackled.

06:34.495 --> 06:35.763
What are you talking about?

06:35.796 --> 06:38.632
Cesar the Barefoot Bandito
kept Estela in a love cage

06:38.666 --> 06:41.502
until she finally
developed feelings for him.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.491
Look, you can't keep me here.

07:03.524 --> 07:04.658
I will be missed.

07:04.692 --> 07:06.727
Tiago starts
a two-week break tomorrow.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.161
My family will
notice I'm gone.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.730
You asked them
for some space.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.732
I'll stay in contact
with them for you.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.033
Give me your passcode.

07:13.066 --> 07:15.703
No, I will not do it.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.906
(gasps)

07:18.939 --> 07:20.641
No, not the face.

07:20.674 --> 07:21.642
Dear God,

07:21.675 --> 07:23.544
not the face.

07:23.577 --> 07:26.013
007!
It's 007!

07:38.058 --> 07:40.027
Which brings us here now

07:40.060 --> 07:42.896
to the biggest acting challenge
 of Rogelio's career.

07:42.930 --> 07:44.698
Thank you, dear Lola.

07:44.732 --> 07:47.134
It's so hard to believe
I once feared you.

07:49.236 --> 07:51.238
In some ways, it was working.

07:51.271 --> 07:53.541
Occasionally,
 she removed his arm shackles.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.609
See?

07:55.643 --> 07:56.610
(phone chimes)

07:56.644 --> 07:58.011
But not in all ways.

07:58.045 --> 07:59.613
Another text from Jane?

07:59.647 --> 08:02.550
"Dad, it's been two weeks.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.918
"I know I really hurt
you and I'm sorry,

08:04.952 --> 08:06.920
"but please stop
shutting us out.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.789
When do you get back?"

08:10.558 --> 08:13.994
Please, Lola,
she needs more than that.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.763
She's missing her father.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.966
I'll think about it.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.034
Time for night-night.

08:21.068 --> 08:23.671
Maybe one night
without the pill?

08:25.706 --> 08:26.640
(chuckles)

08:31.078 --> 08:32.746
I love you, Rogo.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.686
Heard you got a lead
on our missing person.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.754
Yep, Derek's ex-girlfriend
is back in town.

08:40.788 --> 08:43.123
I know what you're thinking.

08:43.155 --> 08:45.693
Who is Derek?
 Well, Derek is...

08:45.726 --> 08:48.696
Actually, what the hell? Let's
Scandal our way through this.

08:50.664 --> 08:53.634
What?
 Michael's not the only fan.

08:53.667 --> 08:54.802
Derek Ruvelle,
son of Rafael's mother,

08:54.835 --> 08:56.303
Elena Di Nola.

08:56.336 --> 08:57.605
Rafael's half brother.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.206
Is he a good guy or a bad guy?

08:59.239 --> 09:02.109
Here's what we know-- rich kid,
dropped out of Pepperdine.

09:02.142 --> 09:05.078
Classic Trustafarian,
he travels.
Spends his mother's money.

09:05.112 --> 09:07.247
Here's where it gets exciting--
our buddy Derek disappeared

09:07.280 --> 09:09.049
the day after Mutter's identity
was discovered.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.584
Social media accounts
remain silent.

09:10.618 --> 09:12.219
Last known whereabouts place him

09:12.252 --> 09:13.921
in St. Croix traveling
with this woman,

09:13.954 --> 09:16.089
Avery Van Allen.

09:16.123 --> 09:17.925
So find me Avery Van Allen.

09:17.958 --> 09:19.760
Just landed back in Miami.

09:19.793 --> 09:20.794
She was in Ibiza.

09:20.828 --> 09:22.696
Want me to pick her up?
No.

09:22.730 --> 09:24.798
Let's see if we can
catch her off-guard.

09:24.832 --> 09:27.868
Before she knows
we're looking for her.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.171
No, definitely not.

09:31.204 --> 09:32.706
I have no interest
in finding my brother.

09:32.740 --> 09:33.807
MICHAEL:
I know that.

09:33.841 --> 09:35.275
I'm just asking you to help us

09:35.308 --> 09:36.677
make contact, get information.

09:36.710 --> 09:39.279
Sorry, I'm not getting involved.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.250
(door opens)

09:43.283 --> 09:44.952
Well, looks
like Rafael's

09:44.985 --> 09:46.920
pretty much killing
my investigation.

09:46.954 --> 09:47.955
Oh, wait, I'm sorry.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.957
This is a Rafael-free zone.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.792
What is, what is all this?

09:51.825 --> 09:53.627
Well, it's silly, but

09:53.661 --> 09:55.929
today we would've been
married one year.

09:55.963 --> 09:58.165
So I thought we might
as well celebrate anyway.

09:58.198 --> 10:00.701
Old-school
Jane and Michael style.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.302
Oh, yeah?
Old-school?

10:02.335 --> 10:04.972
Mmm, hard-core old-school.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.840
(laughs)

10:06.874 --> 10:08.842
Oh, I had the same thought.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.212
Happy would've-been-
our-anniversary.

10:12.245 --> 10:14.014
Oh...

10:14.047 --> 10:15.215
Open it, open it, open it,
open it, open it, open it.

10:15.248 --> 10:16.316
(laughs)
Okay!

10:17.184 --> 10:18.652
(gasps)

10:18.686 --> 10:19.953
No way.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.121
The new Angelique Harper?

10:21.154 --> 10:22.155
Mm-hmm.

10:22.189 --> 10:23.757
Oh...

10:23.791 --> 10:24.992
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

10:25.025 --> 10:27.995
And a hardcover, how decadent!

10:28.028 --> 10:29.396
Well, you know me--
living large.

10:29.429 --> 10:30.731
And this is good.

10:30.764 --> 10:33.000
I can look at her
without cringing.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.736
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Ah, yes, you'll recall
 this happened last year.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.705
Even my masseuse has
a manuscript.

10:37.738 --> 10:40.073
Oh, no, no, I-I-I'm not...
You don't want me to read that?

10:40.107 --> 10:42.409
Well, I-I do...

10:42.442 --> 10:44.745
Let's see how the massage
goes first, okay, honey?

10:46.780 --> 10:48.749
I wonder why she never
responded to my chapter.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.751
She liked my massage, trust me.

10:50.784 --> 10:51.985
Lots of moaning.

10:52.019 --> 10:52.986
Ooh.
(phone chimes)

10:53.020 --> 10:54.021
Oh.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.996
You all right?

11:03.030 --> 11:05.032
Yeah, fine.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.770
Okay, let's eat.

11:09.803 --> 11:12.005
Wait, I thought tonight was
old-school Jane and Michael.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.274
It is.
So what would
old-school Jane do?

11:14.307 --> 11:18.345
Beg to push dinner for an hour
so that I could start reading.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.180
Fine, one hour.
(giggles)

11:20.213 --> 11:22.716
Oh, man,
 a new Angelique Harper!

11:22.750 --> 11:25.185
Let's see what it's about.

11:35.863 --> 11:38.298
Huh, that's weird.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.208
Wait a minute.

11:49.242 --> 11:50.878
What's going on?

11:50.911 --> 11:52.913
Angelique Harper stole my idea.

11:57.918 --> 12:01.088
Just listen! "The harrowing
story of a young woman

12:01.121 --> 12:02.823
"who bravely goes undercover

12:02.856 --> 12:05.292
"as a man during
the Revolutionary War

12:05.325 --> 12:07.360
and falls for her mysterious
commanding officer"?

12:07.394 --> 12:08.962
She just changed
the war and the names!

12:08.996 --> 12:11.064
Turns out, she's coming
into town for her book tour.

12:11.098 --> 12:12.065
She is?
Mm-hmm.

12:12.099 --> 12:13.901
Perfect.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.035
I'm gonna confront her,
and I am going to tell her

12:15.068 --> 12:17.871
not only has she invited
a major lawsuit,

12:17.905 --> 12:19.873
but she has lost
a very loyal fan.

12:19.907 --> 12:21.942
How similar are they?
Where's your computer?

12:21.975 --> 12:24.978
What's Alba do
with your laptop?

12:25.012 --> 12:28.882
Watching this Venezuelan priest
who puts his sermons online.

12:28.916 --> 12:31.819
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Pablo?
 As in Pablo Alonso Segura,

12:31.852 --> 12:33.453
the man Alba lost
 her virginity to?

12:33.486 --> 12:35.488
Let's translate this.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.026
What?

12:39.059 --> 12:40.460
Nothing.

12:40.493 --> 12:42.495
Uh, so how do I prove
plagiarism?

12:45.866 --> 12:48.568
My girl is "plucky
and stubborn to a fault."

12:48.601 --> 12:51.438
She calls Clementine
"scrappy and bullheaded."

12:51.471 --> 12:53.273
Write everything down,
every similarity.

12:53.306 --> 12:56.109
Prohibitive similarities,
that's what we're looking for.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.511
Which is tricky, because there's
coincidence. There's this case

12:58.545 --> 13:00.413
of Dennis the Menace.
Two separate cartoonists...

13:00.447 --> 13:02.549
Shh. I need to get through this.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.818
You know what, I'm gonna
call the DA tomorrow

13:04.852 --> 13:06.386
and ask her legal advice.

13:06.419 --> 13:08.555
Jane.

13:11.424 --> 13:14.828
(whispering):
It'll be okay.

13:14.862 --> 13:17.230
Yeah.

13:17.264 --> 13:19.466
I just loved
that idea.

13:19.499 --> 13:22.502
And I was gonna
go back to it.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.905
And now I can't.

13:24.938 --> 13:27.574
*

13:27.607 --> 13:29.476
I can't even...

13:29.509 --> 13:31.845
Is she why you've been late
to so many meetings?

13:31.879 --> 13:33.847
No. No! Told you.

13:33.881 --> 13:36.049
Jane and I have been getting
our signals crossed.

13:36.083 --> 13:38.151
You're hungover. Again.

13:38.185 --> 13:40.988
Oh, Petra, honestly, back off.

13:41.021 --> 13:41.989
Not in the mood.

13:42.022 --> 13:42.990
I'm tired.

13:43.023 --> 13:43.991
PETRA:
You're tired?

13:44.024 --> 13:45.859
I'm full-term with twins.

13:45.893 --> 13:47.527
Do you have any idea
how rare that is?

13:47.560 --> 13:49.496
I'm a medical freakin' marvel.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.899
I'm just blowing off
some steam, I guess,

13:51.932 --> 13:53.934
before I become
a father of three.

13:56.403 --> 13:58.571
No, you're not.

13:58.605 --> 14:01.942
No, you're going to
that dark place of yours.
What?

14:01.975 --> 14:04.244
Yeah, that place,
that place you go to.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.246
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: In his
 defense, he had just discovered

14:06.279 --> 14:10.083
his stepmother and his mother
 were rival crime lords.

14:10.117 --> 14:11.484
Oh, and Jane dumped him.

14:11.518 --> 14:12.585
I just have a lot going on.

14:12.619 --> 14:14.888
Yes, I know.

14:14.922 --> 14:17.557
But all that other stuff,
it's out of your control.

14:17.590 --> 14:21.428
And you're about to become
a father of three.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.630
So enough with the
self-indulgence and grow up.

14:25.665 --> 14:27.634
Yeah.

14:27.667 --> 14:30.270
No, you're right.
Really?

14:30.303 --> 14:31.939
Huh, that was easy.

14:31.972 --> 14:33.606
MICHAEL:
 So it's gonna be hard

14:33.640 --> 14:35.175
but not impossible.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.277
The DA says the first step
is establishing

14:37.310 --> 14:39.112
that your material
predates Angelique's.

14:39.146 --> 14:41.114
Did you e-mail the chapter
to anyone around then,

14:41.148 --> 14:42.649
so we can, you know,
establish your timeline?

14:44.251 --> 14:46.253
Yeah, um, Rafael.

14:48.321 --> 14:51.158
Okay, so let's search
your sent e-mails.

14:56.196 --> 14:58.598
*

14:59.699 --> 15:01.001
(groans)

15:02.735 --> 15:04.204
We don't have
to do this right now.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.672
No, it's-it's important.

15:05.705 --> 15:08.241
(chiming)

15:08.275 --> 15:10.643
Okay, so let's search
your sent e-mails.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.245
You must have sent
it to me, right?

15:12.279 --> 15:14.247
Of course I did, because
you read every single draft

15:14.281 --> 15:15.915
of every single thing I do.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.089
Yep, there's my story.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.657
Team Cordero-Villanueva
for the win!

15:24.691 --> 15:25.492
(whoops)

15:27.194 --> 15:28.595
Look, at least
you found the e-mail.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.263
Okay, shh, shh.

15:30.297 --> 15:32.265
Hi there, Alison?

15:32.299 --> 15:34.267
Yes, it's Olivia,
Angelique Harper's assistant.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.336
We met in the city
during the holidays.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.505
Anyway, um, I'm doing
some bookkeeping,

15:38.538 --> 15:40.507
and I wanted to know if you
know what fiscal quarter,

15:40.540 --> 15:43.510
uh, Angelique's first draft of
 Revolution of the Son came in?

15:43.543 --> 15:44.744
Me?

15:44.777 --> 15:47.347
Olivia... Pope...erson.

15:47.380 --> 15:48.982
What?

15:49.016 --> 15:50.450
Oh, you know what,
I can't hear you!

15:50.483 --> 15:52.019
Yeah, I-I think I'm just,
like, under a tunnel,

15:52.052 --> 15:53.453
so I'll just call you back!

15:53.486 --> 15:55.588
Okay, you were right.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.024
That was a horrible idea.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.527
Mom.
You got to see this.

16:00.560 --> 16:01.761
What?

16:01.794 --> 16:02.762
I was checking my
e-mails, I swear.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.731
I didn't mean to see it,
but there's this chat

16:04.764 --> 16:08.135
between Mom and some guy.
Oh, Mom, don't look at those.

16:08.168 --> 16:10.603
Come on, she was
using my computer.
Too late. Too late.

16:10.637 --> 16:13.040
"My glorious Alba, how I long
to see you, to touch you,

16:13.073 --> 16:15.408
"to kiss you..."
Okay, enough, Mom.

16:15.442 --> 16:18.178
"...like I did in 1972
when we made love"?

16:19.379 --> 16:21.348
Oh, my God.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.783
She had sex.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.253
With a guy who wasn't Dad?

16:27.354 --> 16:30.257
Wait, why aren't you
freaking out?

16:30.290 --> 16:32.092
Did you know?

16:32.125 --> 16:35.062
Yeah, but she just
told me it happened.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.596
She's really embarrassed,
so don't say anything.

16:36.629 --> 16:38.498
Mom, I'm serious.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.700
What a hypocrite.

16:40.733 --> 16:42.269
Let it go.

16:42.302 --> 16:43.670
Says the girl
who just impersonated

16:43.703 --> 16:45.172
Angelique Harper's assistant.

16:45.205 --> 16:46.606
What?
Why don't you let that go?

16:46.639 --> 16:47.707
That's different.

16:50.410 --> 16:51.811
Oh, uh, nothing.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.646
We were actually just, um...

16:53.680 --> 16:57.117
discussing one of Angelique's
passages from her book.

16:57.150 --> 17:00.320
And the fact that you had sex
before you were married!
Seriously?!

17:01.254 --> 17:02.522
No.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.124
No, she read the
messages from Pablo.

17:04.156 --> 17:06.425
You lied to me
this whole time?

17:17.237 --> 17:20.240
Oh, my God, are you serious?

17:20.272 --> 17:22.175
You're such a hypocrite.

17:31.518 --> 17:33.453
I did not
sleep around, Ma!

17:33.486 --> 17:35.322
Do not make me feel
like a slut!

17:37.224 --> 17:38.225
You are!

17:38.258 --> 17:39.426
Like you always have!

17:39.459 --> 17:41.261
And I am not!

17:41.294 --> 17:44.264
I am just a normal woman
who enjoys having sex.

17:44.297 --> 17:48.135
And you have made me feel like
crap about it my entire life!

17:49.602 --> 17:52.605
(crying):
And that's why I'm so pissed.

18:02.315 --> 18:04.384
She's right, Abuela.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.687
I'm gonna go make sure
that she's okay.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.722
*

18:28.641 --> 18:30.443
Hey.

18:30.477 --> 18:31.678
You okay?

18:33.346 --> 18:35.148
Yeah, I just...

18:35.182 --> 18:36.549
I don't know.

18:36.583 --> 18:39.386
It just came out.

18:39.419 --> 18:41.421
You don't have
to explain.

18:45.192 --> 18:47.160
Your dad's tweeting again.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.161
Really?

18:48.195 --> 18:49.829
(chuckles)

18:55.668 --> 18:57.637
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Talk about a staycation.

18:57.670 --> 19:01.408
Okay, last photo,

19:01.441 --> 19:02.742
and you'll tweet
that you're so sad

19:02.775 --> 19:04.344
that the trip
is nearly over.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.647
Perfection.

19:08.415 --> 19:10.717
Well, that's easy.

19:10.750 --> 19:11.918
I am sad.

19:11.951 --> 19:13.753
Because this time
has been so special.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.388
That's one way to put it.

19:15.422 --> 19:17.790
And now we must
return to reality,

19:17.824 --> 19:19.326
as the couple we are.

19:19.359 --> 19:20.960
If you return.
Hmm?

19:20.993 --> 19:23.730
We're at the part of the
story that I love so much.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.815
And that's how I feel.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.484
I love you.

19:44.517 --> 19:45.718
*

19:45.752 --> 19:48.488
But, see, I don't believe you.
What?

19:48.521 --> 19:50.990
It doesn't feel the same,
like you love me like that.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.525
But I do.
Don't lie to me!

19:52.559 --> 19:54.527
Okay, fine,
you're right.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.896
We're not at the part of the
story where I'm in love yet.

19:56.929 --> 19:58.998
We're in the part
of the story

19:59.031 --> 20:01.701
where Estela realizes there's
something holding her back.

20:03.936 --> 20:06.806
You have alienated
me from Jane.

20:06.839 --> 20:09.809
She still thinks
I'm angry with her.

20:09.842 --> 20:12.011
And you won't let me
put her mind at ease.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.646

20:13.680 --> 20:15.482
Daniel Day-Lewis
 would be proud!

20:15.515 --> 20:20.320
Look, I understand family.

20:20.353 --> 20:22.722
I miss my mother every day.

20:22.755 --> 20:26.626
Sometimes I wish I
hadn't killed her.

20:26.659 --> 20:31.464
As a gesture, to improve our
relationship, let's reply.

20:31.498 --> 20:32.799
Good.
I'll type!

20:32.832 --> 20:34.801
What do you
want to say?

20:34.834 --> 20:36.803
(clears throat)

20:36.836 --> 20:38.805
"Dear Jane.

20:38.838 --> 20:41.808
"I'm sorry I haven't
reached out.

20:41.841 --> 20:44.811
It's just that I'm having
a wonderful vacation..."

20:46.879 --> 20:49.849
"...and service
has been spotty.

20:49.882 --> 20:52.051
"But you don't have
to apologize.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.053
"It's fine.

20:54.086 --> 20:57.056
"I love you.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.892
And tell your mom, 'besos.'"

20:59.926 --> 21:02.662
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Hmm. Something tells me a besos

21:02.695 --> 21:04.564
is not just a besos,
 in this case.

21:04.597 --> 21:07.600
And then I usually add four
happy-face-heart-eye emojis.

21:10.803 --> 21:11.971
"Besos"?

21:12.004 --> 21:13.606
What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

21:13.640 --> 21:14.807
(laughing):
What do you mean?

21:14.841 --> 21:16.343
It's a sweet
message finally.

21:16.376 --> 21:18.077
It's not sweet at all.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.613
Why?
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Yes, why? What is it, Xo?

21:20.647 --> 21:22.815
He used to end his texts
to me with "besos"

21:22.849 --> 21:24.317
until I made him stop.

21:24.351 --> 21:27.754
You respond to your creepy
Twitter stalkers

21:27.787 --> 21:29.756
and tell them, "Besos"?

21:29.789 --> 21:32.525
Each and every fan
is a gift, Xiomara.

21:32.559 --> 21:35.362
Yeah, but you say
the same thing to me.

21:35.395 --> 21:36.796
I don't want to be lumped in

21:36.829 --> 21:38.064
with thousands
of other stalker fans.

21:38.097 --> 21:39.899
Millions.

21:39.932 --> 21:43.936
And you're right, I will never
text "besos" to you again.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.972
You're too special to me.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.009
And now he texts it to me?

21:50.042 --> 21:51.844
What am I supposed to think?

21:51.878 --> 21:54.914
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
"Besos" equals "creepy stalker."

21:54.947 --> 21:56.916
He's obviously being
passive-aggressive.

21:56.949 --> 21:58.951
I'm not special anymore.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.887
No, that's not it!

22:00.920 --> 22:02.822
Anyway, I should just stop
obsessing about this.

22:02.855 --> 22:04.891
I should just let it go, right?

22:04.924 --> 22:06.393
No! Don't let it go!

22:06.426 --> 22:08.461
Probably.

22:08.495 --> 22:09.729
But I am gonna
write him back, okay?

22:09.762 --> 22:11.664
You should. Absolutely.

22:14.033 --> 22:16.969
"I really do feel terrible
that I didn't come

22:17.003 --> 22:19.038
"to the Tiago premiere.
I should have been there,

22:19.071 --> 22:21.641
"but you have to know how
important you are to me,

22:21.674 --> 22:22.875
"and I miss you and love you,

22:22.909 --> 22:25.612
"and as soon as you come
back from vacation,

22:25.645 --> 22:27.614
I want to see you."

22:27.647 --> 22:29.716
You're lucky to have her.

22:29.749 --> 22:31.050
I really am.

22:31.083 --> 22:33.653
And I look forward to you two

22:33.686 --> 22:34.921
getting to know
each other better.

22:36.789 --> 22:40.026
All right, let's give you
your sleeping pill.

22:40.059 --> 22:42.061
LUCA: I'm telling you,
 he was out of it.

22:42.094 --> 22:43.996
Like, a sloppy drunk mess.

22:44.030 --> 22:46.466
At first I wasn't sure
it was Rafael, but it was him.

22:49.669 --> 22:50.670
You positive about that?

22:51.904 --> 22:53.606
Talk or you're fired.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.508
It takes four texts
and three phone calls

22:55.542 --> 22:56.509
for you to pick up?

22:56.543 --> 22:57.944
I was almost asleep.

22:57.977 --> 22:59.946
You almost woke up Mateo.

22:59.979 --> 23:00.913
Well, this is important.

23:00.947 --> 23:02.482
Something's up with Rafael.

23:02.515 --> 23:04.884
Petra, that's not
my responsibility.

23:04.917 --> 23:05.885
Are you kidding me?

23:05.918 --> 23:07.153
This is Mateo's father.

23:07.186 --> 23:09.055
I know.
And I'm worried.

23:09.088 --> 23:10.690
He's been neglecting
work lately,

23:10.723 --> 23:12.659
and he's been drinking a lot.

23:12.692 --> 23:14.927
Our server saw him wasted
at the Fontainebleau today.

23:14.961 --> 23:16.496
He told me he was
with Mateo. Was he?

23:16.529 --> 23:17.897
No.
I tried to talk to him,

23:17.930 --> 23:19.932
but I guess
I didn't get through.

23:19.966 --> 23:23.135
And... he listens to you.

23:23.169 --> 23:24.971
Please?

23:25.004 --> 23:26.138
MICHAEL:
Jane.

23:26.172 --> 23:27.574
(whispering):
You okay?

23:31.644 --> 23:32.712
I'll call you back, okay?

23:32.745 --> 23:34.747
But I...
I'll call you back.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.650
What's wrong?

23:40.553 --> 23:41.921
That was Petra.

23:41.954 --> 23:43.623
She's worried about Rafael.

23:43.656 --> 23:45.925
He's been off lately

23:45.958 --> 23:47.694
and was totally wasted today
at the Fontainebleau.

23:47.727 --> 23:50.530
Look, I'm sorry to bring him up,

23:50.563 --> 23:53.099
it's... it's just, I'm...
I'm worried, too.

23:53.132 --> 23:57.937
It... it's not
what you think it is.
What?

23:57.970 --> 24:02.041
Rafael was there today because
he's working with the police.

24:02.074 --> 24:03.242
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Let me fill you in.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.711
Remember this?

24:04.744 --> 24:05.945
I just have a lot going on.

24:05.978 --> 24:08.114
Yes, I know.

24:08.147 --> 24:10.950
But all that other stuff,
it's out of your control.

24:10.983 --> 24:14.521
Rafael realized it wasn't
 in fact all out of his control.

24:14.554 --> 24:16.155
There was one thing
 he could do.

24:16.188 --> 24:18.157
I want to help you
find my mother.

24:19.692 --> 24:21.794
You guys are working together.

24:21.828 --> 24:25.865
Yes, but, look, that's
obviously privileged.

24:25.898 --> 24:27.967
I didn't want you
to go chasing after him.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.969
*

24:30.002 --> 24:32.639
I wasn't gonna
go chasing after him.

24:32.672 --> 24:35.041
Didn't mean it like that.

24:35.074 --> 24:37.209
I know.

24:37.243 --> 24:39.011
Or maybe I did.

24:40.046 --> 24:41.213
I'm sorry.

24:41.247 --> 24:43.215
I'm... I'm just
trying to be honest.

24:43.249 --> 24:46.586
Seeing those e-mails
between you two,

24:46.619 --> 24:48.888
it really bothered me.

24:50.156 --> 24:51.724
I know.

24:51.758 --> 24:54.160
You were in
love with him.

24:54.193 --> 24:56.563
And I knew that.

24:56.596 --> 24:59.566
But seeing them...

24:59.599 --> 25:02.301
I don't know.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.604
It brought me
back to that night.

25:04.637 --> 25:05.905
I can't be with you.

25:05.938 --> 25:08.040
I'm so sorry, Michael.

25:09.776 --> 25:11.611
*

25:11.644 --> 25:14.947
I keep telling myself
it won't happen again,

25:14.981 --> 25:17.650
but... you know.

25:17.684 --> 25:20.953
Trust me, I wish I could go back
and make a different choice.

25:20.987 --> 25:23.155
*

25:26.025 --> 25:28.661
(faint, echoed chiming)

25:33.099 --> 25:36.035
*

25:36.068 --> 25:37.904
(exhales)

25:43.610 --> 25:46.245
And you don't have,
like, a boat sale coming up?

25:47.246 --> 25:48.748
No. Got it.

25:48.781 --> 25:51.117
Okay, let's pull the trigger.

25:51.150 --> 25:52.652
Thank you.

25:52.685 --> 25:53.920
Whew.

25:53.953 --> 25:55.254
$400 for a boat rental?

25:55.287 --> 25:56.789
It's worth it.

25:56.823 --> 25:58.825
Michael keeps going back
to that moment,

25:58.858 --> 26:01.093
so I want to redo it.

26:01.127 --> 26:03.029
Make a new
memory for us.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.096
The way it should have happened.

26:04.997 --> 26:06.833
Petra?

26:06.866 --> 26:09.301
PETRA:
Look, I need your help.
Don't worry,

26:09.335 --> 26:11.738
it's not about Rafael.
Well, it is, but
only peripherally.

26:11.771 --> 26:13.139
He just canceled on me.
Hi, Petra.

26:13.172 --> 26:16.042
Oh. Hello, Xiomara.

26:17.076 --> 26:18.678
Cute shorts.

26:18.711 --> 26:20.179
Thank you.
Your hair is nice.

26:20.212 --> 26:22.048
Thank you.

26:22.081 --> 26:24.684
(sighs): Anyway, Rafael...
was supposed to take me

26:24.717 --> 26:26.786
to my birthing class--
a class he insisted

26:26.819 --> 26:28.120
on signing me up for.

26:28.154 --> 26:29.789
I don't want to go alone
and sit there

26:29.822 --> 26:31.190
with all those
smug judgy moms staring at me.

26:33.893 --> 26:38.064
Okay, so... are you here
to ask me if I'll go with you?

26:38.097 --> 26:40.266
Would you?
I don't want to go alone.

26:41.300 --> 26:43.135
Can you watch Mateo?

26:44.203 --> 26:46.706
Okay, let's do it.

26:46.739 --> 26:48.340
JANE: You sure
 you don't want me to drive?

26:48.374 --> 26:51.043
Nope. Have to keep
control of the car.

26:51.077 --> 26:53.245
'Cause we're not going
to birthing class, we're
going to confront Rafael.

26:53.279 --> 26:54.781
What?

26:54.814 --> 26:56.783
Sorry, I had to get
you into the car.

26:56.816 --> 26:59.218
I tracked him down
using Find My Phone.
He's at The W.

26:59.251 --> 27:01.120
Yeah, probably meeting, like,
a work contact for happy hour.

27:01.153 --> 27:02.288
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Or a person of interest

27:02.321 --> 27:03.756
for the police for happy hour.

27:03.790 --> 27:05.958
Oh, my God! Stop
being so naive, Jane!

27:05.992 --> 27:08.060
This is serious!
Look, he listens to you,

27:08.094 --> 27:10.162
so we're going to
confront him together.

27:10.196 --> 27:12.164
Do something, Jane!

27:12.198 --> 27:14.000
Or Petra's gonna blow
 this investigation wide open!

27:14.033 --> 27:16.135
LOLA:
 Freeze! Don't move.

27:16.168 --> 27:18.337
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow, that
 generic drugstore tan-in-a-box

27:18.370 --> 27:22.174
isn't doing you
 any favors, buddy.

27:22.208 --> 27:24.343
Bless you,
Lola-- I feel

27:24.376 --> 27:25.745
so much better now.

27:25.778 --> 27:28.014
You're so thoughtful.

27:31.383 --> 27:33.786
*

27:35.187 --> 27:37.456
Tell me,
when we emerge as a couple,

27:37.489 --> 27:39.058
do you prefer...

27:39.091 --> 27:40.159
Rola...

27:40.192 --> 27:42.028
or Logelio?

27:48.935 --> 27:50.336
Let's think about it tonight.

27:50.369 --> 27:52.338
After a special dinner.

27:52.371 --> 27:54.040
Sure.

27:54.073 --> 27:58.210
And it's special...
why, exactly?

27:58.244 --> 27:59.746
Because there's a full moon.

27:59.779 --> 28:01.213
Don't you remember?

28:01.247 --> 28:02.148
Cesar and Estela

28:02.181 --> 28:05.918
ate dinner and then they
finally made love...

28:05.952 --> 28:08.154
in the light of the full moon.

28:08.187 --> 28:10.289
(chuckles weakly)
PETRA: What?!

28:10.322 --> 28:13.192
Rafael's working
with the police?

28:13.225 --> 28:14.460
Well, you could've told
me this an hour ago.

28:14.493 --> 28:16.128
Have you got any idea
how hard it is

28:16.162 --> 28:17.396
to drive this pregnant?
Seriously?

28:17.429 --> 28:19.231
You practically kidnapped me!

28:19.265 --> 28:20.800
Whatever. Let's go.

28:20.833 --> 28:22.268
MAN (on radio):
Join me in welcoming

28:22.301 --> 28:23.970
best-selling romance novelist

28:24.003 --> 28:25.805
Angelique Harper.
Ugh!

28:25.838 --> 28:27.306
What? I thought you loved her.

28:27.339 --> 28:29.475
Didn't... Rafael,

28:29.508 --> 28:31.778
like, propose or something
during a reading?

28:31.811 --> 28:34.881
Yeah. But after,

28:34.914 --> 28:36.448
well...

28:36.482 --> 28:38.517
I went to her room
with my chapter,

28:38.550 --> 28:40.787
she mistook me
for a masseuse,

28:40.820 --> 28:42.989
I gave her a 90-minute massage,
and then I gave her my chapter,

28:43.022 --> 28:45.357
and then she stole my idea.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.326
You gave her a massage?

28:47.359 --> 28:50.129
Did you not hear me?
She stole my idea.

28:50.162 --> 28:51.998
She did.

28:52.031 --> 28:54.433
It's always so interesting
to hear what inspires an artist.

28:54.466 --> 28:56.836
How did Revolution of the Son
come about?

28:56.869 --> 28:59.305
ANGELIQUE:
You know, it's funny.
I was getting a massage,

28:59.338 --> 29:02.008
and I was... so relaxed,

29:02.041 --> 29:04.543
the idea just sprang
from my head fully formed.

29:04.576 --> 29:06.312
Not unlike Athena,

29:06.345 --> 29:07.914
from the head of Zeus.
Oh, my God,

29:07.947 --> 29:09.248
she stole your idea!

29:09.281 --> 29:10.282
I told you!

29:10.316 --> 29:12.384
I'm just trying to let it go.

29:12.418 --> 29:14.420
Let it go? What is
wrong with you?

29:14.453 --> 29:16.522
No, we can't let her
get away with this.

29:16.555 --> 29:19.225
Where's that book signing?
We're gonna get her to admit it.

29:19.258 --> 29:20.827
You want to help me?

29:20.860 --> 29:23.429
Okay, don't make it
into a thing, all right?

29:23.462 --> 29:26.232
I'm overdue with twins
and looking to yell at someone.

29:26.265 --> 29:28.100
(tires squealing)

29:30.136 --> 29:32.905
JANE:
This could take hours.
PETRA: All right.

29:32.939 --> 29:35.107
Excuse me, pardon me.
Hi. I'm sorry, I'm pregnant.

29:35.141 --> 29:36.542
Do you mind if I just
kind of squeeze through?

29:36.575 --> 29:38.277
I really appreciate it.
Excuse me, pardon me. Could I...

29:38.310 --> 29:40.179
No.
Oh.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.182
Yeah, never mind.
We'll wait.

29:43.215 --> 29:44.416
You need some
prep time, anyway.

29:44.450 --> 29:46.418
So, what are you gonna
say to Angelique?

29:46.452 --> 29:47.854
Trust me,
I've been rehearsing this.

29:47.887 --> 29:49.455
I'm gonna say,
"Do you remember me?

29:49.488 --> 29:52.258
You stole my idea.
I left a chapter with you."

29:52.291 --> 29:54.260
And I threw it away-- I don't
accept unsolicited materials.

29:54.293 --> 29:55.928
What are you doing?

29:55.962 --> 29:57.329
Toughening you up.
I'm sure any similarity

29:57.363 --> 29:58.497
was coincidental.

29:58.530 --> 30:00.332
Coincidental?
It's the same idea.

30:00.366 --> 30:03.102
Security, take her away.
Okay, stop. Enough.
You made your point.

30:03.135 --> 30:05.872
What do you suggest I say?

30:05.905 --> 30:07.373
I have a confession.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.311
A confession?

30:12.344 --> 30:14.613
So early in the day?

30:14.646 --> 30:16.916
Well, it must be the tequila.

30:21.387 --> 30:24.323
It wasn't totally random...

30:24.356 --> 30:26.058
our meeting.

30:27.159 --> 30:29.295
I'm trying to find my brother.

30:29.328 --> 30:30.963
His name's Derek.

30:30.997 --> 30:32.598
What?
Hold on. Wait, wait.

30:32.631 --> 30:34.300
Look, I just need
to talk to him, okay?

30:34.333 --> 30:35.367
He's my brother.

30:35.401 --> 30:37.436
Stay away from me. All of you.

30:39.571 --> 30:42.241
Hi, Angelique. I'm here
because the plot of your book

30:42.274 --> 30:44.476
was stolen from a chapter
that I gave you,

30:44.510 --> 30:46.412
and I've had a committee
of independent authors

30:46.445 --> 30:49.481
review the works side by side,
and my legal team seems to think

30:49.515 --> 30:51.317
I have a pretty strong case.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.085
So I'm here to tell you

30:53.119 --> 30:57.023
that a formal complaint
is forthcoming.
All right. Better.

30:57.056 --> 30:58.424
Yeah, right?
Yeah.
But you need

30:58.457 --> 30:59.458
to drop your voice
another octave.

30:59.491 --> 31:00.927
And never lose eye contact.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.028
Calm.

31:02.061 --> 31:03.395
Quiet.

31:03.429 --> 31:05.031
It's always much scarier.

31:05.064 --> 31:06.532
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 It really is.

31:06.565 --> 31:09.001
Got it. On it.
Good.

31:09.035 --> 31:10.002
You're welcome.

31:10.036 --> 31:11.503
Oh, my God. Oh!

31:12.972 --> 31:15.474
Sorry. I feel like
I'm peeing my pants.

31:15.507 --> 31:18.945
(groans) The babies must
be right on my bladder.
Really?

31:18.978 --> 31:20.512
Are you sure that your water
just didn't break?

31:20.546 --> 31:23.115
What? I don't know.
You're the one who had a baby.

31:23.149 --> 31:24.616
My water didn't break.
It's-it's rare, actually.

31:24.650 --> 31:26.318
That's true.
My sister's did.

31:26.352 --> 31:28.620
It's not a big splash
like they show on TV.

31:28.654 --> 31:29.455
Does it feel like
you're peeing?

31:29.488 --> 31:31.090
Yep. Just feels
like you're peeing.

31:31.123 --> 31:32.624
Oh, my God, I feel
like I'm peeing!

31:32.658 --> 31:34.326
Okay, all right, stay calm.
We're gonna go to the hospital.

31:34.360 --> 31:35.527
You're up, miss.
Oh...

31:35.561 --> 31:37.329
PETRA:
Go. I'm calling an Uber.

31:37.363 --> 31:39.598
I'd be lying
 if I said Jane didn't

31:39.631 --> 31:40.933
briefly consider it.

31:40.967 --> 31:42.534
No, no, come on, come on.

31:42.568 --> 31:44.536
Step aside, people,
she's having a baby!

31:44.570 --> 31:45.671
Two babies!

31:45.704 --> 31:47.439
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Oh, boy!

31:47.473 --> 31:48.975
Looks like we're
 doing this again!

31:53.379 --> 31:55.514
Where is he?
Michael's getting him,
Rafael's gonna be here.

31:55.547 --> 31:58.217
No, not Rafael, the doctor with
the drugs, I need the drugs.

31:58.250 --> 32:01.353
Oh, good. Uh, she is ready
for her epidural.

32:01.387 --> 32:04.390
So, here's the thing.
You can't have one, Petra.
What?

32:04.423 --> 32:06.225
Your blood tests indicate
that your platelet levels

32:06.258 --> 32:08.094
are too low,
it's too risky,

32:08.127 --> 32:09.428
you could bleed too much.

32:09.461 --> 32:11.030
Any wiggle room there?

32:11.063 --> 32:12.431
Excuse me?

32:12.464 --> 32:14.500
Look, if there's a 50% chance
I won't die,

32:14.533 --> 32:16.335
I'd like to go for it.

32:16.368 --> 32:18.137
She's kidding.
No, I'm not kidding.

32:18.170 --> 32:19.438
Petra, you can do this.
She can do this.

32:20.472 --> 32:21.507
RAFAEL:
 Hurry!

32:21.540 --> 32:23.142
Multi-car
accident up ahead,

32:23.175 --> 32:25.177
fire, the works.

32:25.211 --> 32:26.478
The highway's
down to one lane.

32:28.147 --> 32:30.249
Yeah.

32:38.490 --> 32:39.491
Oh, no,
it's coming back.

32:39.525 --> 32:42.461
Oh, oh, oh, oh... oh...

32:42.494 --> 32:43.762
Okay, breathe. Breathe...

32:43.795 --> 32:46.165
Oh, shut up, that's not working!

32:46.198 --> 32:48.000
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Is it me or is labor
 making Petra meaner?

32:48.034 --> 32:49.335
Don't clench, you gotta let go.

32:49.368 --> 32:50.469
Distract me!

32:50.502 --> 32:52.504
Um, okay...
Quick!

32:52.538 --> 32:53.505
Uh, uh, uh...

32:53.539 --> 32:55.041
Michael and I are having issues.

32:55.074 --> 32:56.675
Did you ever see
that movie Sliding Doors?

32:56.708 --> 32:58.144
Hated it.
Anyway, I just keep thinking

32:58.177 --> 32:59.345
about how I screwed things up

32:59.378 --> 33:01.380
and how I wish I could
just take it back.

33:01.413 --> 33:03.549
That's so stupid.
What?

33:03.582 --> 33:05.251
Well, clearly things
weren't that great,

33:05.284 --> 33:06.452
or you wouldn't have broken up.

33:08.587 --> 33:10.689
Let the past go...

33:10.722 --> 33:12.558
(laughs)
Says the woman

33:12.591 --> 33:14.360
who artificially inseminated
herself with her ex's sperm.

33:14.393 --> 33:18.264
Trust me,
I'm regretting that now.

33:18.297 --> 33:19.265
(chuckles)

33:19.298 --> 33:21.733
(snorts, exhales)

33:21.767 --> 33:24.470
Also full of regrets?

33:51.230 --> 33:54.566
(sighs)

34:17.523 --> 34:20.092
(sighs)

34:20.126 --> 34:21.659
Thanks, Ma.

34:21.693 --> 34:25.764
Here's how you can
make it up to me.

34:27.632 --> 34:29.568
You can tell me about Pablo.

34:29.601 --> 34:31.603
I'm serious.

34:31.637 --> 34:33.804
I want details.

34:35.407 --> 34:36.507
What did he look like?

34:43.449 --> 34:45.251
Huh?
(laughs)

34:45.284 --> 34:46.717
JANE:
 "Sexy, strong,

34:46.752 --> 34:48.620
"like the man
she knew all those years ago,

34:48.654 --> 34:50.755
out on the battlefield."
(wailing)

34:51.889 --> 34:54.426
Keep reading!
Oh. "She-she

34:54.460 --> 34:57.463
"couldn't be sure it was him,
but it was. They spoke.

34:57.496 --> 35:00.232
"'Oh!' her father said.
(shouts)

35:00.266 --> 35:02.868
"The pain was unbearable.
It was the kind of pain

35:02.901 --> 35:05.237
that tore
through her."
(shouting)

35:05.271 --> 35:07.139
Breathe, Petra,
(moaning)

35:07.173 --> 35:08.474
breathe.

35:08.507 --> 35:09.575
(exhales)

35:09.608 --> 35:10.476
"It was him.
He looked at her

35:10.509 --> 35:13.379
and her breath caught,
just like always..."

35:13.412 --> 35:16.182
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And a funny thing happened
 as she read from her novel:

35:16.215 --> 35:18.517
Jane realized her book
 and Angelique's

35:18.550 --> 35:20.519
weren't actually that similar.

35:20.552 --> 35:22.554
Well, except
 for the cross-dressing premise,

35:22.588 --> 35:25.524
but, really, Jane had ripped
 that off of Twelfth Night.

35:25.557 --> 35:28.594
And Shakespeare had based his
 on some Italian play and...

35:28.627 --> 35:30.229
What's wrong with you?
Keep reading!

35:30.262 --> 35:32.498
"Mauricio's skin was glistening
a little. Sweaty."

35:32.531 --> 35:34.333
LOLA:
Looks like
you finished dinner.

35:34.366 --> 35:36.802
Do they really make love
right after?

35:36.835 --> 35:38.904
Because I get a little bloaty
after dinner.

35:40.706 --> 35:41.907
To true love.

35:41.940 --> 35:44.676
And all the different ways
it grabs you.

35:46.578 --> 35:48.547
Okay.

35:48.580 --> 35:51.917
Get ready.

35:51.950 --> 35:53.585
(groans)

35:53.619 --> 35:54.420
Are you all right?

35:54.453 --> 35:55.854
Just got a little tired.

35:55.887 --> 35:57.856
Let's cuddle up then.
Here, lay down.

35:57.889 --> 35:59.691
Okay.
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

35:59.725 --> 36:03.295
Just for a minute.
All right.

36:03.329 --> 36:05.597
Okay, so here's what happened.

36:05.631 --> 36:06.832
Remember this?

36:06.865 --> 36:08.334
Let's give you
your sleeping pill.

36:14.673 --> 36:15.974
Rogelio considers

36:16.007 --> 36:18.277
his oily T-zone
 to be his one facial flaw.

36:18.310 --> 36:20.846
And so he had the costumer
 of Tiago

36:20.879 --> 36:23.215
sew a special pocket in his
 underwear where he could stash

36:23.249 --> 36:24.483
a secret supply
 of pressed powder.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.685
A little powder panty pocket.

36:26.718 --> 36:29.688
And he stored the pill
 in there.

36:31.657 --> 36:34.326
And from there, he slipped it
 into her drink.

36:35.794 --> 36:37.596
Hurry, Rogelio.

36:37.629 --> 36:40.332
Just find the keys
 and get out of there!

36:40.366 --> 36:41.967
(moaning)
Okay, here we go.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.669
I'm gonna need
you to push.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.571
Where's Rafael?

36:45.604 --> 36:47.306
Uh, he's hurrying.

36:47.339 --> 36:48.674
I'm not gonna make it, am I?

36:48.707 --> 36:50.476
I don't think so.

36:50.509 --> 36:51.677
I'm sorry.

36:55.414 --> 36:56.715
I'm sorry.

36:56.748 --> 36:57.783
(Petra shouts)

36:57.816 --> 37:00.686
Come on, Petra, push.

37:00.719 --> 37:02.688
I can't. I can't anymore.

37:02.721 --> 37:05.891
And so Jane said the words her
 grandmother said to her mother

37:05.924 --> 37:07.793
and her mother said to her...

37:07.826 --> 37:11.897
Five minutes of pain
for a lifetime of happiness.

37:18.804 --> 37:20.572
It's time, Petra. Push again.

37:20.606 --> 37:22.608
No, I'm done. I can't.
I'm gonna need you to push.

37:22.641 --> 37:25.043
No, I can't.
Are you serious?
After all that talk in the line

37:25.076 --> 37:26.478
at the bookstore
about being tough?

37:26.512 --> 37:27.613
(moaning)

37:27.646 --> 37:30.449
Suck it up

37:30.482 --> 37:33.919
and push those babies out.

37:35.954 --> 37:37.756
(whimpers)

37:37.789 --> 37:41.360
(breathing rapidly)

37:41.393 --> 37:44.630
(grunting, shouting)

37:46.632 --> 37:48.900
(baby crying)

37:48.934 --> 37:51.437
Here she is. A little girl.

37:51.470 --> 37:54.306
(panting)
She's beautiful.

37:55.674 --> 37:57.909
(laughs)

37:57.943 --> 37:59.545
Oh, okay.
Yes.

37:59.578 --> 38:01.447
Okay. Ready to go again.

38:01.480 --> 38:02.681
Huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.

38:02.714 --> 38:03.482
(panting)

38:03.515 --> 38:05.551
Come on.

38:05.584 --> 38:06.852
(panting)

38:06.885 --> 38:09.688
(grunting, shouting)

38:09.721 --> 38:12.057
(baby crying)

38:14.393 --> 38:17.763
(panting)

38:17.796 --> 38:19.064
(laughs)

38:19.097 --> 38:20.866
(panting)

38:20.899 --> 38:22.100
Is it over?

38:22.133 --> 38:23.569
It's over.

38:23.602 --> 38:25.036
You did it.
(sobs)

38:25.070 --> 38:26.772
You did it.

38:26.805 --> 38:29.708
(crying)

38:36.915 --> 38:39.885
I'm sorry I called you
all those horrible names.

38:39.918 --> 38:40.452
You didn't.

38:40.486 --> 38:42.020
Oh, I-I did. Trust me.

38:42.053 --> 38:43.489
It was just in Czech.

38:45.757 --> 38:48.660
Thank you, though.

38:48.694 --> 38:50.562
Of course.

38:50.596 --> 38:52.564
Hey, do you want
to know their names?

38:52.598 --> 38:54.400
Rafael and I
already decided.

38:54.433 --> 38:56.602
Elsa.

38:56.635 --> 38:57.836
And Anna.

38:57.869 --> 38:59.505
(laughs)
Wait...

38:59.538 --> 39:00.439
What?

39:00.472 --> 39:01.673
E-Elsa and Anna?

39:01.707 --> 39:02.741
Like in Frozen?

39:02.774 --> 39:04.042
What do you mean?

39:04.075 --> 39:05.444
That's the names
of the sisters.

39:05.477 --> 39:06.678
In Frozen.

39:06.712 --> 39:08.113
The movie?

39:08.146 --> 39:09.781
Oh.
(scoffs)

39:09.815 --> 39:11.983
Well, no one except for you
would think of that.

39:12.017 --> 39:14.786
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Let it go, Jane.

39:15.721 --> 39:17.122
Nice names.

39:17.155 --> 39:18.657
Just beautiful.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.058
Oh, I missed it.
Oh.

39:20.091 --> 39:21.693
I can't believe I missed it.
How are you?

39:21.727 --> 39:22.761
I'm okay.

39:22.794 --> 39:24.129
She was a warrior.

39:24.162 --> 39:24.930
(chuckles)
Here.

39:25.897 --> 39:27.599
That's Elsa.
Oh.

39:27.633 --> 39:30.769
Hi. Hi, Elsa.

39:31.903 --> 39:33.505
Hi, Anna.

39:33.539 --> 39:35.507
Oh,

39:35.541 --> 39:36.775
wow. They're beautiful.

39:36.808 --> 39:38.844
They are, right?
It's not just me?

39:38.877 --> 39:41.179
(sneezes, cries)
No.

39:41.212 --> 39:45.584
(chuckles)
No, they're perfect.

39:45.617 --> 39:47.453
They're so perfect.

39:53.459 --> 39:54.860
Oh, yeah!
(laughs)

39:54.893 --> 39:56.562
I'm starving.
Salt and vinegar.

39:56.595 --> 39:59.798
You rock.
Wow. Easy to please.

39:59.831 --> 40:03.001
And to think, I rented a boat.

40:03.034 --> 40:06.938
I wanted to go back and redo the
moment when things went wrong,

40:06.972 --> 40:08.874
when I made the wrong choice.
Oh,

40:08.907 --> 40:10.208
I sh... I shouldn't
have brought that up.
No.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.210
No, it's okay. Because, um,

40:12.243 --> 40:14.780
I realized...

40:14.813 --> 40:16.815
I don't want to go back.

40:16.848 --> 40:20.486
I mean, there was a lot of stuff
wrong in our relationship.

40:20.519 --> 40:23.455
I mean, you weren't being
honest about who you were.

40:23.489 --> 40:27.459
I wasn't being honest
about what I wanted in life.

40:27.493 --> 40:30.762
And that's why we broke up.

40:30.796 --> 40:32.498
Are you breaking up with me now?

40:32.531 --> 40:35.734
Never. No.

40:35.767 --> 40:38.570
I'm just saying I
don't want to go back.

40:38.604 --> 40:40.038
Because we're better now.

40:40.071 --> 40:41.573
Yeah.
And I want
you to know

40:41.607 --> 40:45.977
that you are
absolutely who I want.

40:46.011 --> 40:49.080
And I'm not going anywhere.

40:49.114 --> 40:50.949
I'm not either.

40:50.982 --> 40:53.218
Oh.
(gasps)

40:53.251 --> 40:56.154
I wasn't gonna do this here,
but, Jane...

40:56.187 --> 40:58.524
Yes! Yes! Okay!
Wait, wait. Can I ask?

40:58.557 --> 41:00.859
Okay, get ready.
Okay, Jane. Will you...
Yes. Sorry. Yes.

41:00.892 --> 41:02.227
Sorry, sorry, sorry!
Will you... will you marry me?

41:02.260 --> 41:03.228
Will you marry me?
Yes! Yes!

41:03.261 --> 41:05.831
Ah, true love.

41:05.864 --> 41:08.834
The kind Angelique Harper
 might write about.

41:08.867 --> 41:11.870
Were this a romance novel.

41:11.903 --> 41:13.872
But, of course, it's not.

41:13.905 --> 41:15.807
I thought you'd be excited.

41:19.044 --> 41:21.513
Yep. And he's coming.

41:21.547 --> 41:22.948
Xiomara.

41:31.823 --> 41:33.625
Ocean view, perfect.

41:33.659 --> 41:35.260
And how long
will you be staying for?

41:36.294 --> 41:39.197
Not sure.

41:39.230 --> 41:40.599
(grunting)
(rattling)

41:45.837 --> 41:48.239
I knew it. You were lying to me.

41:48.273 --> 41:50.275
Please, Lola. Don't make me do
it. Please stop or I'll shoot!

41:55.046 --> 41:56.915
You would've shot me?

41:56.948 --> 41:57.949
No.

41:57.983 --> 41:59.985
I knew it was a fake.
