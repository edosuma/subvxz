UH, KIM ALLAN.

01:38.369 --> 01:40.371
SHE HAD STAGE IV
LARGE CELL LUNG CANCER.

01:40.371 --> 01:42.373
I REMOVED A SECOND MASS
FROM HER RIGHT LUNG

01:42.373 --> 01:44.835
ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO,
BUT HER TESTS HAD SHOWED THAT

01:44.835 --> 01:47.838
THE CANCER HAD SPREAD TO HER
LYMPH NODES AND TO HER LIVER.

01:47.838 --> 01:50.541
SHE WAS READMITTED LAST WEEK
WITH PULMONARY EDEMA.

01:50.541 --> 01:52.883
I DRAINED AS MUCH FLUID
AS I COULD,

01:52.883 --> 01:55.586
BUT SHE IS STILL HAVING
A TOUGH TIME BREATHING.

01:55.586 --> 01:58.249
THAT'S TOO BAD. YOU GONNA
HAVE TO INTUBATE HER?
SHE DOESN'T WANT THAT.

01:58.249 --> 02:00.321
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
TREAT HER PALLIATIVELY.

WE CAN DO FOR HER.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.625

02:17.208 --> 02:18.769
OKAY.

02:18.769 --> 02:22.873
HER PROGNOSIS SAYS THAT SHE HAS
LESS THAN SIX MONTHS TO LIVE.

02:22.873 --> 02:26.817
I HAVE INFORMED HER
OF HER TREATMENT OPTIONS.

02:26.817 --> 02:29.620
SHE HAS MET WITH A PSYCHOLOGIST
WHO HAS DETERMINED

02:29.620 --> 02:31.582
THAT SHE IS MENTALLY FIT.

02:31.582 --> 02:34.885

(clears throat)

03:49.330 --> 03:51.231

04:01.972 --> 04:03.744
IF YOU REMAIN UPRIGHT?

04:03.744 --> 04:06.747
LIKE I'LL BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW

04:18.729 --> 04:20.731

OR GASTRITIS.
ALL RIGHT, GET TO THE POINT.
YOU HAVE 15 SECONDS.

05:10.541 --> 05:13.043

THE NAUSEA IS PROBABLY CAUSED

05:13.043 --> 05:16.086

C.S.F. OKAY.
BRAIN TUMOR. GOT IT.

05:16.086 --> 05:18.088

ANY BRAIN TUMOR.

RESECTION...

EVEN GET TO DEBULK THE TUMOR.

A SLOW DEATH

06:37.968 --> 06:40.030
HOOKED UP TO MACHINES

10:04.705 --> 10:07.177
I ALMOST HAVE
MY GUY STABILIZED.
YOU'LL RIDE WITH HIM
ON THE MEDEVAC.

10:07.177 --> 10:09.880
TAKE MY AMPUTATION
AND THE HEAD TRAUMA, TOO.

10:09.880 --> 10:12.182
HUNT, WE'LL TAKE YOUR G.S.W.
IN THE A.P.C.

10:12.182 --> 10:15.185
LET'S MOVE.
YOU WANT ME TO GO?

10:15.185 --> 10:17.648
NO, I'M FINE.
YOU HATE HELICOPTERS.

10:17.648 --> 10:19.990
I KNOW. I'M FINE.

10:19.990 --> 10:21.952
I'LL SEE YOU BACK THERE.

10:21.952 --> 10:23.954
SEE YOU BACK THERE.
(men speak indistinctly)

10:23.954 --> 10:28.198
(voice echoes)
SHALL WE SCAN HIM FIRST?

10:28.198 --> 10:29.730
(man speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

10:29.730 --> 10:32.202
(normal voice) SEE WHAT KIND
OF DAMAGE WE'RE DEALING WITH

10:32.202 --> 10:34.204
IN CASE WE NEED AN O.R.?

10:34.204 --> 10:36.206
HE'S GOT
SOME ABDOMINAL BRUISING.

10:36.206 --> 10:39.069
YEAH, YEAH, OKAY.
YOU--YOU TAKE THIS.

10:39.069 --> 10:41.772
UH, GET HIM UP TO C.T.
(woman) RIGHT AWAY, DOCTOR.

10:41.772 --> 10:45.345
HEY, HOW COME YOU DIDN'T
GET HURT IN THE AVALANCHE?
OH, I NEVER GOT OFF
THE HELICOPTER.

10:45.345 --> 10:48.378
I WAS ABOUT TO JUMP
WHEN THE AVALANCHE STARTED.

10:48.378 --> 10:50.751
YOU MISSED IT, TOMMY.
IT WAS FRIGGIN' AWESOME.

10:50.751 --> 10:53.323
(Nick) YEAH, TOMMY,
FRIGGIN' AWESOME!

10:53.323 --> 10:55.255
YEAH, TOMMY.
FRIGGIN' AWESOME.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.027
(elevator bell dings)

10:57.027 --> 11:00.160
UH, DR. ALTMAN
SAID YOU REQUESTED

11:00.160 --> 11:02.162
TO LOWER YOUR PAIN MEDS.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.394
THEY MAKE ME FUZZY.

11:04.394 --> 11:06.396
I DON'T WANT
TO BE FUZZY TODAY.

11:06.396 --> 11:08.398
DID SHE TELL YOU?

11:08.398 --> 11:11.141
THAT YOU'RE GOING HOME?
YEAH.

11:11.141 --> 11:13.143
OH, I CHANGED MY MIND.
WHAT?

11:13.143 --> 11:16.046
NO, NO, NOT ABOUT...
I JUST...

11:16.046 --> 11:19.109
I WANT TO DO IT HERE...
IN THE HOSPITAL.

11:19.109 --> 11:21.912
I DON'T WANT SEAN TO HAVE TO
DEAL WITH MY BODY AFTERWARDS.

11:21.912 --> 11:23.253
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THAT STUFF.

11:23.253 --> 11:25.756
WE CAN MAKE THIS PLACE
LIKE HOME, YOU KNOW?

11:25.756 --> 11:28.018
GET RID OF ALL THESE MACHINES

11:28.018 --> 11:30.761
AND... GET SOME OF
OUR STUFF--

11:30.761 --> 11:34.094
MY QUILT, SOME PICTURES...
MM-HMM.

11:34.094 --> 11:36.266
SOME WINE.

11:36.266 --> 11:38.028
CAN WE HAVE WINE?

11:38.028 --> 11:40.771
I DON'T SEE WHY NOT.

11:40.771 --> 11:42.773
IF YOU NEED WINE...
I DON'T.

11:42.773 --> 11:45.806
THEN MAYBE YOU DON'T
REALLY WANT--
I DON'T NEED WINE.
I WANT THE WINE.

11:45.806 --> 11:48.308
BUT I THINK
YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.841
YOU SEEM SCARED.

11:50.841 --> 11:54.244
ARE YOU SCARED?
(exhales deeply)

11:54.244 --> 11:57.717
STOP WORRYING ABOUT ME.
ALL THESE THINGS
ARE HAPPENING,

11:57.717 --> 12:00.250
AND I'M MAKING
ALL THESE CHOICES,

12:00.250 --> 12:02.923
AND I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW YOU'RE FEELING.

12:02.923 --> 12:05.055
I'M NOT FEELING ANYTHING.

12:05.055 --> 12:07.357
SEAN, I'M TALKING ABOUT
WHERE I'M GONNA DIE.

12:07.357 --> 12:09.359
YOU HAVE TO BE
FEELING SOMETHING.

12:09.359 --> 12:14.064
(labored breathing)

12:14.064 --> 12:16.306
I'LL GO HOME
AND GET THE STUFF, ALL RIGHT?

12:16.306 --> 12:17.407
SEAN.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.511
RED OR WHITE?

12:21.511 --> 12:23.914
(exhales) RED.

12:23.914 --> 12:25.475
(labored breathing)

12:25.475 --> 12:28.078
IN A WINE GLASS,
NOT A PLASTIC CUP.

12:28.078 --> 12:30.220
OKAY.

12:30.220 --> 12:33.053
(labored breathing)

12:33.053 --> 12:34.885
IT NEVER CHANGES.

12:34.885 --> 12:38.188
YOU HAVE THE SAME FIGHTS.

12:38.188 --> 12:41.892
I MEAN, EVEN WHEN YOU'RE DYING,
YOU HAVE THE SAME FIGHTS.

12:41.892 --> 12:43.794
YOU WANT TO KNOW
HOW THEY'RE FEELING,

12:43.794 --> 12:45.796
AND THEY DON'T WANT
TO TELL YOU.

12:45.796 --> 12:47.267
(sighs) SORRY. I'M--

12:47.267 --> 12:49.069
DON'T BE.

12:49.069 --> 12:51.441
(labored breathing)

12:51.441 --> 12:53.443
I THINK THEY DON'T KNOW.

12:53.443 --> 12:55.946
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU ASK THEM
HOW THEY'RE FEELING,

12:55.946 --> 12:57.908
AND THEY DON'T WANT
TO TELL YOU,

12:57.908 --> 13:00.380
AND YOU THINK
THEY'RE BEING DIFFICULT?

13:00.380 --> 13:03.313
I THINK
THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW.

13:03.313 --> 13:05.015
(labored breathing continues)

13:05.015 --> 13:06.416
RELAX.

13:06.416 --> 13:08.919
DEEP BREATHS.
DEEP BREATHS.

13:08.919 --> 13:11.791
(inhales and exhales)
GOOD.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.463
(inhales deeply)

13:13.463 --> 13:16.126
(exhales)

13:16.126 --> 13:18.128
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

13:18.128 --> 13:20.130
WHERE DO YOU STAND ON
PHYSICIANS'-ASSISTED SUICIDE?

13:20.130 --> 13:22.232
WELL, I'M NOT OPPOSED TO IT.
GOOD.

13:22.232 --> 13:25.205
AND AS LONG AS WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT THE CONTROVERSIAL STUFF,

13:25.205 --> 13:27.207
LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT--

13:27.207 --> 13:29.209
ARENA FOOTBALL
IS NOT REAL FOOTBALL.

13:29.209 --> 13:32.212
OBVIOUSLY--
MARK, MARK, WAIT. THIS IS NOT
ME GETTING TO KNOW YOU.

13:32.212 --> 13:35.185
THIS IS... I HAVE A PATIENT
WHO'S TERMINAL.

13:35.185 --> 13:37.487
SHE WANTS TO DIE
AND SHE WANTS MY HELP,

13:37.487 --> 13:40.150
AND I WANT YOURS.

13:44.294 --> 13:45.595
SEE THAT?

13:45.595 --> 13:47.127
THE TUMOR'S PRESSING DOWN

13:47.127 --> 13:49.129
ON THE FLOOR
OF THE FOURTH VENTRICLE,

13:49.129 --> 13:51.231
WHICH IS CAUSING THE NAUSEA.
SO YOU DEBULK THE TUMOR,

13:51.231 --> 13:53.233
AND THEN YOU MOVE ON
TO THE STALK--

13:53.233 --> 13:55.565
NO. YOU DEBULK THE TUMOR.
(door opens)

13:55.565 --> 13:58.108
(laughs)
DR. SHEPHERD
HAS REQUESTED THESE SCANS.

13:58.108 --> 13:59.409
HIS SCHEDULE HAS FREED UP.

13:59.409 --> 14:01.912
HE'S DECIDED TO DO
THE RESECTION HIMSELF.

14:01.912 --> 14:04.214
OH, NO! THAT'S MY--
I AM DEBULKING. IT'S MY TUMOR.

14:04.214 --> 14:06.116
IT'S DR. SHEPHERD'S TUMOR NOW.

14:06.116 --> 14:09.019
(scans crinkle)

14:17.057 --> 14:19.059
DR. HUNT,
CAN I HELP YOU?

14:19.059 --> 14:21.061
UH, NO. NO, NO,
I GOT IT.

14:24.594 --> 14:28.598
(vehicle rumbling)

14:28.598 --> 14:31.902
OSCAR-4-KILO,
THIS IS ECHO-5-GULF.

14:31.902 --> 14:35.445
OSCAR-4-KILO,
THIS IS ECHO-5-GULF.

14:35.445 --> 14:37.477
ANYTHING, SERGEANT?
NO, SIR.

14:37.477 --> 14:40.610
I THINK IT'S THE STORM.
YEAH, WELL, THEY KNOW
WE'RE COMING, RIGHT?

14:40.610 --> 14:43.213
ALL RIGHT.

14:43.213 --> 14:46.286
WHERE ARE WE GOING?
GREEN ZONE, BABY.

14:46.286 --> 14:47.988
THEY'LL STABILIZE YOU,

14:47.988 --> 14:51.291
THEN YOU ARE GOING
TO A HOSPITAL IN GERMANY.

14:51.291 --> 14:54.594
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA GO HOME.
OKAY?

14:54.594 --> 14:57.067
TEDDY GET THERE YET?

14:57.067 --> 14:59.899
NO WORD. (laughs)

14:59.899 --> 15:02.672
DON'T WORRY. I'M SURE
YOUR GIRL'S JUST FINE.

15:02.672 --> 15:06.276
STOP IT. I AM SERIOUS.
WE'RE FRIENDS.
(laughs) YEAH,
KEEP TELLING YOURSELF THAT.

15:06.276 --> 15:08.278
(explosion, rumbling)

15:16.546 --> 15:18.188
(metal squeaks)

15:18.188 --> 15:20.620
AH, DAMN. (grunts)

15:32.262 --> 15:34.434
(exhales)

15:34.434 --> 15:36.166
(grunts)

15:36.166 --> 15:37.968
(Dan) HUNT?!

15:37.968 --> 15:40.340
YOU ALL RIGHT, HUNT?!

15:40.340 --> 15:43.213
I'M OKAY. YOU OKAY?

15:43.213 --> 15:44.674
YEAH.

15:44.674 --> 15:47.217
WE MUST HAVE HIT AN I.E.D.

15:47.217 --> 15:49.479
HOW ARE THE PATIENTS?

15:49.479 --> 15:51.481
I DON'T KNOW.

15:51.481 --> 15:54.284
I GOTTA FIND 'EM ALL.

16:11.741 --> 16:14.244
(exhales deeply)
EVERYONE'S GONE. WE LOST GEKKO.

16:14.244 --> 16:16.206
(panting)

16:16.206 --> 16:18.308
DAN?

16:18.308 --> 16:20.350
DAN.

16:23.253 --> 16:26.216
(Cristina) OWEN?

16:26.216 --> 16:29.259
OWEN?

16:29.259 --> 16:30.390
OWEN?

16:30.390 --> 16:31.561
WHAT?

16:31.561 --> 16:34.664
YOU PAGED.

16:34.664 --> 16:37.467
WHEN YOU DID
KIM ALLAN'S EVALUATION,

16:37.467 --> 16:40.400
DID YOU SCOPE HER?
WHAT? WAIT.
IS THAT HER CHART?

16:40.400 --> 16:42.402
DR. ALTMAN'S PATIENT, WHO,
ACCORDING TO THIS CHART,

16:42.402 --> 16:45.175
YOU ORDERED PULMONARY
FUNCTION TESTS ONE WEEK AGO.

16:45.175 --> 16:47.277
I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF,
DURING THAT EVALUATION,

16:47.277 --> 16:49.309
YOU DID A BRONCHOSCOPY.
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

16:49.309 --> 16:52.182
CAN YOU JUST ANSWER
THE QUESTION?
WHY ARE YOU INTERROGATING ME?

16:52.182 --> 16:54.384
P.F.T.s CAN GIVE YOU
FALSE POSITIVES,

16:54.384 --> 16:57.087
AND A PATIENT MAY KILL HERSELF
DUE TO INCORRECT DATA.
WELL, IT'S ROUTINE,
SO WE PROBABLY DID--

16:57.087 --> 16:59.489
PROBABLY? PROBABLY
IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU?

16:59.489 --> 17:01.551
PROBABLY IS GOOD ENOUGH
FOR DR. ALTMAN?

17:01.551 --> 17:05.495
WHAT IS GOING ON?
ARE...

17:05.495 --> 17:08.228
OWEN.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.230
(Tommy) DID YOU CALL LANI?

17:10.230 --> 17:12.302
UM, YOU SHOULD CALL
YOUR WIFE.

17:12.302 --> 17:16.706
SHE'LL FREAK. TOMMY, CALL WHEN
I GO IN. DOWNPLAY IT.

17:16.706 --> 17:18.538
IT'S A BROKEN LEG.

17:18.538 --> 17:21.341
A LITTLE FROSTBITE ON YOUR
FINGERS, BUT NOTHING TERRIBLE.

17:21.341 --> 17:23.173
YOU'RE ABOUT TO...
AAH!

17:23.173 --> 17:25.044
UM,
SCREAM REALLY LOUD.

17:25.044 --> 17:28.278
(pants) THAT WAS WORSE THAN WHEN
I BROKE MY ANKLE ON KILIMANJARO.

17:28.278 --> 17:30.320
YOU GUYS
CLIMBED KILIMANJARO?
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.

17:30.320 --> 17:33.353
I MADE IT TO THE SUMMIT WHILE
THESE GUYS GOT ALTITUDE SICKNESS

17:33.353 --> 17:36.126
HALF A MILE FROM THE TOP.
(laughs) MAN.
YOU GUYS ARE HARD-CORE.

17:36.126 --> 17:38.188
WE GOTTA BE.
I SELL INSURANCE.

17:38.188 --> 17:40.660
PHIL AND TOMMY
ARE ACCOUNTANTS.
(squirts)

17:40.660 --> 17:44.234
AH! THESE TRIPS ARE ALL WE GOT
TO KEEP OUR BLOOD MOVING.

17:44.234 --> 17:46.396
HEY, SHOW 'EM THE PICTURE
OF YOU ON TOP OF KILI

17:46.396 --> 17:48.398
WITH THE RUBBER CHICKEN.
(Callie laughs)

17:48.398 --> 17:51.201
THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
YOU ON A MOUNTAIN.

17:51.201 --> 17:53.803
OH, SORRY.
THAT'S MY DAUGHTER HANNAH.

17:53.803 --> 17:56.446
LADYBUG FOR HALLOWEEN.

17:59.309 --> 18:03.383
YOU TELLING ME
YOU DON'T WANT ONE OF THOSE?

18:05.785 --> 18:07.657
(speaking indistinctly)

18:07.657 --> 18:10.190
YOU STOLE MY SURGERY
RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER ME.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.262
IT WASN'T YOUR SURGERY.
IT WAS NELSON'S SURGERY.

18:12.262 --> 18:14.294
IT'S BEYOND NELSON'S
SKILL LEVEL.

18:14.294 --> 18:18.568
RIGHT? I MEAN,
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID--
MY DIAGNOSIS,
MY TUMOR, MY DEBULKING.

18:18.568 --> 18:21.571
CAN I SCRUB IN AT LEAST?
YOU'RE ON NELSON'S SERVICE.

18:21.571 --> 18:24.704
IF I SWITCH YOU, IT'S GONNA
LOOK LIKE FAVORITISM.
DR. NELSON'S BEEN GIVEN
AN ANEURYSM--

18:24.704 --> 18:28.508
YOU STOP TALKING.
(whispers) MEREDITH, CALM DOWN.
PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO STARE.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.140
YOU STOLE MY SURGERY.

18:32.142 --> 18:34.584
HE STOLE MY SURGERY.

18:37.317 --> 18:38.788
EVERYTHING OKAY?

18:38.788 --> 18:42.692
YEAH, IT'S FINE.
EVERYTHING'S, UH... FINE.

18:42.692 --> 18:46.496
HAVE YOU HAD LUNCH YET TODAY?
I'M HEADED DOWN.

18:46.496 --> 18:49.128
OH, I CAN'T EAT
IN THE CAFETERIA ANYMORE.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.301
THE VULTURES
WON'T LEAVE ME ALONE.
VULTURES?

18:51.301 --> 18:52.802
PEOPLE NEED THINGS FROM ME.

18:52.802 --> 18:55.335
SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY
HAS A PRESSING PROBLEM

18:55.335 --> 18:57.337
THAT CAN'T WAIT.
SHEPHERD, YOU HAVE A MINUTE?

18:57.337 --> 18:58.908
MM-HMM. SEE?

18:58.908 --> 19:00.470
(Andrew Belle's "Static Waves"

19:02.542 --> 19:05.575
UGH. MY LUNCH
IS MAKING ME SAD,

19:05.575 --> 19:07.917

STARTED EATING IT YET.

I DIDN'T PULL THE TRIGGER.

20:17.417 --> 20:21.991
♪ I WOULD HAVE LET YOU LEAVE ♪

20:34.233 --> 20:36.235
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

20:36.235 --> 20:37.537
YOU MISSED IT.

20:37.537 --> 20:40.239
ALTMAN TORE HUNT A NEW ONE
IN THE CAFETERIA.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.472
WHOLE HOSPITAL'S
TALKING ABOUT IT.
OH, NOT TO ME.

20:42.472 --> 20:44.474
I WALK IN THE ROOM,

20:44.474 --> 20:47.977
AND ALL CONVERSATION
GRINDS TO A HALT.

20:47.977 --> 20:49.479
WELL, COME ON.

20:49.479 --> 20:52.752
YOU DON'T TALK LOCKER ROOM TALK
IN FRONT OF THE COACH.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.754
I'M NOT A COACH ANYMORE.

20:54.754 --> 20:58.328
I'M A PLAYER. I TAKE A SHOWER
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

21:00.730 --> 21:02.532
RICHARD...

21:02.532 --> 21:05.264
YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.367
BUT MOSTLY,
YOU'RE STILL A COACH.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.899
IT'S A SIGN OF RESPECT.

21:09.899 --> 21:13.473
IT WOULD BE WRONG
TO TAKE IT ANY OTHER WAY.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.679
YOU KNOW THE DRILL--

21:19.679 --> 21:21.781
WE'VE PUT YOU
IN A TWILIGHT STATE,

21:21.781 --> 21:24.614
NEXT WE'RE GONNA SPRAY LIDOCAINE
ON THE BACK OF YOUR THROAT

21:24.614 --> 21:27.417
AND PASS THE SCOPE--
I DON'T GET IT.
SHE HAD THIS TEST LAST WEEK.

21:27.417 --> 21:29.989
IS--IS THERE A CHANCE
THE RESULTS ARE WRONG?
IT'S VERY UNLIKELY.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.991
BUT IT'S POSSIBLE?

21:31.991 --> 21:34.994
YOU WOULDN'T PUT HER THROUGH
THIS AGAIN FOR NO REASON.

21:34.994 --> 21:37.997
YOU MUST THINK THAT THERE'S
A CHANCE THE TESTS WERE WRONG.

21:37.997 --> 21:41.971
THERE ARE QUESTIONS BEING RAISED
THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH--
BY WHO? RAISED BY WHO?

21:41.971 --> 21:45.304
SEAN--
JUST TALK TO ME,
'CAUSE I'M STANDING HERE

21:45.304 --> 21:47.777
THINKING THAT MY WIFE'S
GONNA DIE TODAY,

21:47.777 --> 21:50.340
AND IF THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN,
ALL RIGHT,

21:50.340 --> 21:53.643
IF THERE'S A CHANCE
THAT SHE MIGHT GET BETTER--
(Cristina) YOUR WIFE
ISN'T GONNA GET BETTER.

21:53.643 --> 21:55.645
THIS TEST IS UNNECESSARY,

21:55.645 --> 21:58.317
AND THE HOSPITAL'S
COVERING ITS ASS.

22:07.897 --> 22:09.629
(clicks pen)
(whispers) THANK YOU.

22:09.629 --> 22:12.331
(lowered voice) NO PROBLEM.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.364
JULIE...

22:14.364 --> 22:17.407
CAN YOU FIND OUT
IF DR. BAILEY'S ON HER WAY?

22:17.407 --> 22:20.470
OKAY, DOCTOR.

22:20.470 --> 22:22.341
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

22:22.341 --> 22:24.674
(lowered voice) IF I WASN'T
HAPPILY MARRIED,

22:24.674 --> 22:26.416
I'D HIT HER.

22:26.416 --> 22:28.347
(door opens)

22:28.347 --> 22:31.851
I'D HIT HER HARD.

22:31.851 --> 22:35.354
(metal clatters)

22:35.354 --> 22:37.657
SIR, I THINK
WHAT YOU WANTED TO SAY

22:37.657 --> 22:39.929
WAS "HIT THAT."

22:39.929 --> 22:44.363
I DON'T THINK YOU WANTED
TO SAY THAT AT ALL.

22:50.440 --> 22:52.902
(clears throat)

22:55.875 --> 22:57.947
I HEAR SHEPHERD
TOOK YOUR SURGERY.

22:57.947 --> 23:00.580
HOW'D YOU HEAR THAT?

23:00.580 --> 23:02.482
APPARENTLY YOU YELL
REALLY LOUD.

23:02.482 --> 23:05.485
YEAH, WELL, I HAVE TO HOLD
A RETRACTOR FOR SHADOW SHEPHERD

23:05.485 --> 23:07.386
WHILE DEREK
DEBULKS MY TUMOR.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.388
SO, YES, I YELL VERY LOUD.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.891
YEAH, WELL, THE KEY
IS TO THINK OF YOURSELF

23:11.891 --> 23:14.093
AS ONE OF THE WHOS
DOWN IN WHOVILLE.

23:14.093 --> 23:16.095
WHAT?

23:16.095 --> 23:18.097
YOU KNOW, WHEN, UM,

23:18.097 --> 23:21.100
THE GRINCH CAME DOWN
AND STOLE ALL THEIR PRESENTS...

23:21.100 --> 23:23.473
THEY DIDN'T LET THAT
RUIN CHRISTMAS FOR THEM.

23:23.473 --> 23:26.476
YOU KNOW, INSTEAD, THEY CAME OUT
ON CHRISTMAS MORNING

23:26.476 --> 23:29.509
AND THEY SANG.

23:29.509 --> 23:31.511
YOU'RE GONNA
GO INTO THAT SURGERY,

23:31.511 --> 23:33.813
AND YOU'RE GONNA SING.

23:33.813 --> 23:35.515
(laughs)

23:35.515 --> 23:38.448
SING, CINDY LOU. (chuckles)

23:38.448 --> 23:39.619
SING.

23:39.619 --> 23:42.722
(sighs)

23:42.722 --> 23:45.424
YOUR SCALP LAC IS SMALL ENOUGH

23:45.424 --> 23:48.197
THAT SHOOTING IN LIDOCAINE
WOULD BE MORE PAINFUL

23:48.197 --> 23:51.761
THAN JUST THROWING IN
A COUPLE OF STAPLES.
IS THIS GONNA HURT
LIKE MY FINGERS? BECAUSE--

23:51.761 --> 23:53.833
NOT TOO MUCH.
(thunk)

23:53.833 --> 23:56.866
AAH! GOD! (grunts)
AAH!

23:56.866 --> 23:59.108
AAH!
SORRY, SORRY.

23:59.108 --> 24:00.470
AAH!

24:00.470 --> 24:02.441
OKAY, THAT'S IT.
I GOT IT.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.474
(whimpers)
THE HAND
WAS SWELLING SO MUCH,

24:04.474 --> 24:07.216
IT WOULD'VE POPPED THE FINGER
RIGHT OFF.

24:07.216 --> 24:09.148
(plastic crinkles)
WHAT?

24:09.148 --> 24:11.150
YOU'RE STILL TRYING
TO SAVE THE ARM.

24:11.150 --> 24:14.083
YOU GOTTA TOURNIQUET IT.
IF I DO,
THEN YOU WILL LOSE IT.

24:14.083 --> 24:16.085
(groans)
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE ARM.

24:16.085 --> 24:19.088
IF I COULD JUST TRY TO TIE OFF
THAT BRACHIAL ARTERY--

24:19.088 --> 24:22.562
OWEN!
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE ARM.

24:22.562 --> 24:25.835
YOU'RE RIGHT. I KNOW.
I KNOW. YOU'RE RIGHT.

24:25.835 --> 24:28.097
OKAY, DAN, LISTEN TO ME.

24:28.097 --> 24:29.468
(grunts)

24:29.468 --> 24:31.240
THE BACK OF THIS TRUCK
IS TRASHED.

24:31.240 --> 24:33.843
MOST OF THE SUPPLIES,
ALL THE MORPHINE--

24:33.843 --> 24:36.506
THERE'S NO MORPHINE.
THERE'S NO LIDOCAINE.

24:36.506 --> 24:38.107
YOU BRING WHISKEY?

24:38.107 --> 24:40.249
(both laugh)

24:40.249 --> 24:43.252
(crunching)
AAH!

24:43.252 --> 24:45.484
OKAY, WE GOT IT.
WE GOT IT.

24:45.484 --> 24:48.487
(groans)
WE GOT IT. WE GOT IT.
WE GOT IT.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.920
NO.

24:50.920 --> 24:53.162
I DON'T THINK WE DO.
(grunts)

24:53.162 --> 24:55.925
(fluid trickling)

24:55.925 --> 24:57.496
NO!

25:09.579 --> 25:11.781
(voice echoes) DR. HUNT.

25:11.781 --> 25:15.144
(normal voice)
DR. HUNT.

25:15.144 --> 25:16.916
KIM ALLAN'S BRONCHOSCOPY

25:16.916 --> 25:19.088
CONFIRMED THAT NOTHING MORE
COULD BE DONE.

25:19.088 --> 25:20.590
SLOAN SIGNED OFF.

25:20.590 --> 25:23.022
HE DID HIS DUE DILIGENCE,
BUT IT'S OVER.

25:23.022 --> 25:26.295
YOU'RE NOT GONNA KILL HIM.

25:26.295 --> 25:29.128
I WON'T LET YOU KILL HIM.

25:29.128 --> 25:31.200
YOU'RE NOT GONNA KILL HIM.

25:31.200 --> 25:35.134
DR. HUNT... THE PATIENT
IN QUESTION IS A WOMAN.

25:35.134 --> 25:38.537
NO ONE'S TRYING TO KILL HER.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.539
SHE'S CHOOSING TO DIE.

25:43.072 --> 25:45.544
YOU SHOULD GO HOME.

25:45.544 --> 25:46.876
I HAVE A SURGERY.

25:46.876 --> 25:50.549
YOU'RE DONE FOR THE DAY.
GO HOME.

25:56.185 --> 25:58.988
OKAY, OKAY.
(speaks indistinctly)

25:58.988 --> 26:01.030
CAN YOU--
(groans)

26:01.030 --> 26:03.032
CAN YOU HOLD THIS?
I C--

26:03.032 --> 26:06.335
CAN YOU PUT PRESSURE THERE?
I DON'T THINK--

26:06.335 --> 26:10.339
OKAY, I'M GONNA HAVE TO
MOVE YOU--
OH, NO, I CAN'T. I CAN'T.
I'M TOO TIRED.

26:10.339 --> 26:13.272
NO, NO, NO. DAN, DAN,
WAKE UP. WAKE UP.

26:13.272 --> 26:14.774
I HAVE TO.

26:14.774 --> 26:16.275
IT'S GONNA HURT LIKE HELL,

26:16.275 --> 26:19.178
BUT I HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING
TO PACK THIS WOUND

26:19.178 --> 26:21.210
TILL SOMEONE COMES.

26:21.210 --> 26:23.312
SOMEONE'S COMING?
SOMEONE'S COMING?

26:23.312 --> 26:25.584
OKAY, YOU READY?
(moans)

26:25.584 --> 26:27.116
HERE WE GO.

26:27.116 --> 26:29.088
HERE WE GO.

26:29.088 --> 26:31.621
(grunts)
OKAY, HERE WE GO.

26:31.621 --> 26:33.292
HERE WE GO.
AAH!

26:33.292 --> 26:34.824
OH, PLEASE, PLEASE!

26:34.824 --> 26:36.265
PLEASE!

26:36.265 --> 26:39.268
(crying) PLEASE. PLEASE.
PLEASE. PLEASE.

26:39.268 --> 26:41.731
PLEASE. PLEASE.
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

26:41.731 --> 26:44.133
PLEASE JUST... DON'T.
I'M SORRY.

26:44.133 --> 26:46.075
(mutters)

26:46.075 --> 26:49.639
THERE WE GO. THERE WE GO.

26:49.639 --> 26:53.142
HYPOTHERMIA--
UH, THAT'S THE LAST ONE.

26:53.142 --> 26:54.884
THE LAST...

26:54.884 --> 26:58.217
STOP THAT.
SOMEONE IS COMING.

26:58.217 --> 27:00.720
HELP IS COMING.

27:00.720 --> 27:03.653
YOU BEEN SAYING THAT
FOR HOURS.

27:03.653 --> 27:06.295
(grunts) I'M COAGULOPATHIC.

27:06.295 --> 27:08.928
I'M PROBABLY ACIDOTIC.

27:08.928 --> 27:11.030
I'M IN THE TRIAD OF DEATH.

27:12.662 --> 27:14.333
NO ONE IS COMING.

27:14.333 --> 27:17.166
IF I COULD JUST MOVE YOU--
NO! LOOK, HUNT, I NEED YOU--

27:17.166 --> 27:20.269
I NEED YOU TO SAY
A HAIL MARY WITH ME.

27:20.269 --> 27:23.212
DAN... (exhales)

27:23.212 --> 27:25.244
I DON'T KNOW IT.

27:25.244 --> 27:26.746
THAT'S OKAY.

27:26.746 --> 27:29.378
IT'S OKAY.
JUST SAY IT WITH ME.

27:29.378 --> 27:32.852
(exhales)

27:32.852 --> 27:35.685
HAIL MARY...
HAIL MARY...

27:35.685 --> 27:38.187
FULL OF GRACE...
FULL OF GRACE...

27:38.187 --> 27:40.690
THE LORD IS WITH THEE.
THE LORD IS WITH THEE.

27:40.690 --> 27:43.392
BLESSED ART THOU
AMONGST WOMEN...
BLESSED ART THOU
AMONGST WOMEN...

27:43.392 --> 27:46.996
BLESSED IS THE FRUIT
OF THY WOMB, JESUS.
BLESSED IS THE FRUIT
OF THY WOMB, JESUS.

27:46.996 --> 27:49.238
HOLY MARY, MOTHER OF GOD...
HOLY MARY, MOTHER OF GOD...

27:49.238 --> 27:51.240
PRAY FOR US SINNERS...
PRAY FOR US SINNERS...

27:51.240 --> 27:53.002
NOW...
NOW...

27:53.002 --> 27:55.344
AND AT THE HOUR
OF OUR DEATH.
AND AT THE HOUR
OF OUR DEATH.

27:55.344 --> 27:57.907
AMEN.
AMEN.

27:57.907 --> 28:01.410
YOU MAKE SURE LISA
GETS MY RING, ALL RIGHT?

28:01.410 --> 28:03.112
DON'T GIVE UP, DAN.

28:03.112 --> 28:06.716
DON'T--DON'T USE IT TO PROPOSE
TO ALTMAN OR SOMETHING.

28:06.716 --> 28:08.217
(laughs)

28:08.217 --> 28:10.219
BUT YOU--YOU SHOULD PROPOSE
TO ALTMAN.

28:10.219 --> 28:13.793
(sniffles) YOU KNOW, YOU TWO,
YOU SHOULD--YOU SHOULD...

28:13.793 --> 28:15.795
SHUT UP, DAN.
I'M ENGAGED TO BETH.

28:15.795 --> 28:19.869
AND YOU, YOU ARE GONNA GIVE
THAT RING TO LISA, OKAY?

28:19.869 --> 28:23.202
(grunts) COME ON. COME ON.

28:23.202 --> 28:24.703
WHAT? NO.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.205
(grunts) MOVE YOUR HAND.

28:26.205 --> 28:27.376
NO.

28:27.376 --> 28:28.978
THAT'S AN ORDER, SOLDIER.

28:28.978 --> 28:30.810
NO, SIR.

28:34.183 --> 28:37.186
(thunder rumbles)

28:44.393 --> 28:46.395
THEY'RE WORKING
ON NICK'S KIDNEY.

28:46.395 --> 28:48.898
UH, I WAS ABLE
TO STABILIZE HIS LEGS,

28:48.898 --> 28:52.331
BUT IT'S GONNA BE
A LONG RECOVERY PROCESS.

28:52.331 --> 28:54.503
YOU MAY NEED
TO LET HIS WIFE KNOW

28:54.503 --> 28:57.406
IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE
THAN A BROKEN LEG.
YEAH, I TOLD MY WIFE,
AND SHE'S CALLING LANI.

28:57.406 --> 29:00.009
MY WIFE
CAN HANDLE HER BETTER.

29:00.009 --> 29:02.071
(chuckles) SO YOU--
YOU SUMMITED KILI,

29:02.071 --> 29:03.372
YOU RUN WITH THE BULLS,

29:03.372 --> 29:06.745
BUT YOU'RE--YOU'RE SCARED
OF YOUR FRIEND'S WIFE.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.747
I WAS SCARED ON KILI.
(chuckles)

29:08.747 --> 29:11.050
I HATED EVERY MINUTE OF IT.

29:11.050 --> 29:12.521
SO WHY DO IT?

29:12.521 --> 29:14.753
NICK AND PHIL.
THEY'RE MY BOYS.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.926
AND THEY LOVE ADVENTURE.

29:16.926 --> 29:18.928
ME? I GOT A KID...

29:18.928 --> 29:21.831
AND BAD KNEES.

29:21.831 --> 29:24.864
BUT I CAN'T RUIN IT.
WE'RE A TEAM, YOU KNOW?

29:24.864 --> 29:27.266
SO YOU JUST SUCK IT UP, HUH?

29:27.266 --> 29:29.869
CLOSE MY EYES
AND HOPE I DON'T DIE.

29:29.869 --> 29:32.541
(inhales and exhales)

29:32.541 --> 29:35.274
I CAN'T ACTUALLY
GIVE YOU THE DRUGS,

29:35.274 --> 29:37.776
BUT YOU CAN HAVE
THIS PRESCRIPTION FILLED

29:37.776 --> 29:39.448
IN THE HOSPITAL PHARMACY.

29:39.448 --> 29:44.283
AGAIN, I WANT TO EMPHASIZE,
THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.155
WE CAN
MAKE YOU COMFORTABLE.

29:46.155 --> 29:48.257
I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION.

29:48.257 --> 29:51.190
OWEN, NO--
WHAT IF THEY FIND A CURE?

29:51.190 --> 29:54.824
I KNOW THAT IT'S A LONG SHOT,
BUT ISN'T SAVING YOUR LIFE

29:54.824 --> 29:57.997
WORTH GAMBLING
ON A LONG SHOT?
DR. HUNT, I WILL CALL SECURITY
IF YOU DO NOT STEP--

29:57.997 --> 30:02.071
LET--LET HER ANSWER.
I'D LIKE TO HEAR THE ANSWER.

30:04.373 --> 30:07.436
MAYBE... (sighs)

30:07.436 --> 30:10.379
YOU HAVE TO BE DYING
TO UNDERSTAND.

30:10.379 --> 30:13.412
BUT THERE'S
THIS THING THAT HAPPENS...

30:13.412 --> 30:18.217
(exhales)
WHERE DEATH STOPS BEING SCARY.

30:18.217 --> 30:19.518
(inhales deeply)

30:19.518 --> 30:24.293
WHAT STARTS BEING SCARY
IS HOPE...

30:24.293 --> 30:27.096
'CAUSE IT'S NOT TRUE.

30:27.096 --> 30:31.330
(labored breathing)

30:31.330 --> 30:35.334
EVEN IF THEY FOUND
A CURE FOR CANCER TOMORROW...

30:35.334 --> 30:38.837
IT'S TOO LATE FOR ME.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.240
(exhales)
AND HANGING ON TO HOPE,

30:41.240 --> 30:44.043
IT MAY MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER...

30:44.043 --> 30:47.076
(labored breathing)

30:47.076 --> 30:51.250
BUT IT JUST
MAKES ME FEEL ALONE.

30:54.583 --> 30:57.356
(labored breathing)

30:57.356 --> 31:01.891
I DON'T WANT TO DIE ALONE.

31:01.891 --> 31:05.364
OKAY?
