01:30.381 --> 01:32.399
- Morning.
- Good morning.

01:59.035 --> 02:03.639
When I was in Lublin studying last week,
I found this wonderful book.

02:04.707 --> 02:07.017
Can you believe the price of cabbage?

02:08.544 --> 02:14.034
For instance, he gives 25 different
interpretations of Genesis alone.

02:14.134 --> 02:17.778
Best in the market.
Parsnip, turnip, everything for soup.

02:18.471 --> 02:22.042
Storybooks for women,
sacred books for men.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.127
Lovely picture books for women.

02:24.227 --> 02:26.453
...in each sentence.

02:28.064 --> 02:31.708
Fish, fish. Fishy fish.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.714
- Mama.
- Rachel.

02:40.076 --> 02:42.344
Fish. Fish.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.939
Come, look at this.
Look at this, ladies. Look at this.

02:45.039 --> 02:48.026
Fine herring, carp,
beautiful silver carp.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.653
- Delicious, delicious.
- See the difference?

02:50.753 --> 02:55.691
The skin should be tight, firm,
and the scales shiny like diamonds.

02:55.967 --> 02:57.118
Yentl, how's Papa?

02:57.218 --> 03:00.163
- He's much better, thank you.
- Good, good.

03:00.263 --> 03:01.331
And then there's the smell.

03:01.431 --> 03:05.450
Lovely picture books for women,
sacred books for men.

03:05.685 --> 03:08.505
Storybooks for women,
sacred books for men.

03:08.605 --> 03:11.540
Yentl? Yentl, what would
you like to have?

03:13.109 --> 03:15.178
Yentl, a pike or a carp?

03:15.278 --> 03:17.013
- Fine. Fine.
- A nice carp.

03:17.113 --> 03:20.225
Novels for women, sacred books for men.
Picture books for women...

03:20.325 --> 03:24.594
Yentl, what's this I hear?
You finally got engaged.

03:24.996 --> 03:26.940
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

03:27.040 --> 03:29.442
- Did you or didn't you?
- What, hear about it or do it?

03:30.668 --> 03:34.322
If she can make jokes about finding a
husband at her age, I shouldn't worry.

03:34.422 --> 03:37.566
Here you are, darling.
So beautiful, it'll cook itself.

03:37.967 --> 03:39.536
And what's so funny?
What are you laughing about?

03:39.636 --> 03:41.486
- Are you going to buy my fish today?
- I'll eat chicken.

03:43.181 --> 03:45.625
Storybooks for women,
sacred books for men.

03:45.725 --> 03:47.710
Yentl, did you hear about Helen Shipman?

03:47.810 --> 03:50.537
- I haven't got time today.
- You never do.

03:55.485 --> 03:59.097
- Buy your gruel.
- Novels for women, sacred books for men.

03:59.197 --> 04:01.307
Lovely picture books for women.

04:01.407 --> 04:04.561
So, in the second part,
he relates the mysticism of creation

04:04.661 --> 04:06.762
to the mysticism of language.

04:07.038 --> 04:08.940
There are things in here we
shouldn't even be reading.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.734
- Can we afford it?
- No, but we can read it.

04:11.834 --> 04:14.770
There's one in the rabbi's study.
Come on.

04:22.762 --> 04:25.489
What a nice girl. There's your change.

04:28.184 --> 04:30.545
- You're in the wrong place, miss.
- What?

04:30.645 --> 04:32.755
Books for women are over here.

04:32.855 --> 04:35.758
- Novels, very romantic.
- I'd like to buy this one, please.

04:35.858 --> 04:37.802
- Sacred books are for men.
- Why?

04:37.902 --> 04:40.346
- It's a law, that's why.
- Where is it written?

04:40.446 --> 04:41.890
Never mind where. It's a law.

04:41.990 --> 04:45.018
Well, if it's a law, it must be written
somewhere, maybe in here. I'll take it.

04:45.118 --> 04:49.189
Miss, do me a favor.
Do yourself a favor.

04:49.289 --> 04:52.265
Here, buy a nice picture book.

04:52.458 --> 04:55.769
- Girls like picture books.
- What if I told you it's for my father?

04:57.130 --> 05:00.241
Why didn't you say? Fifteen kopecks.

05:00.341 --> 05:02.827
And if you want to know where
that's written, it's inside the cover.

05:02.927 --> 05:04.319
Thank you.

05:08.154 --> 05:10.793
Good. And who's wise?

05:10.893 --> 05:14.964
- He who knows a lot.
- No, try again. Who's wise?

05:15.064 --> 05:17.091
- He who...
- He who learns from all men.

05:17.191 --> 05:20.637
- He who learns from all men?
- Good. And who's rich?

05:20.737 --> 05:23.264
- Who's rich? Oh, I know that one.
- You know?

05:23.364 --> 05:24.307
He who has a full heart.

05:24.407 --> 05:25.558
He who is content with what he has.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.560
Yentl, is dinner almost ready?

05:27.660 --> 05:31.814
Yes, he who has a full heart, and also,
he who is content with what he has.

05:31.914 --> 05:35.100
But, Reb Mendel, how can one
question have two answers?

05:35.335 --> 05:40.323
David, sometimes there are
many answers to the same question.

05:40.423 --> 05:43.525
Now, the last one. Who is strong?

05:45.845 --> 05:47.580
- Strong...
- No, no, no. Who is strong?

05:47.680 --> 05:51.042
- He who controls his passions.
- Concentrate, David.

05:51.142 --> 05:52.669
Controls his passions.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.286
- Try, David.
- I'm trying.

05:54.979 --> 05:57.289
- He who...
- He who controls his passions!

06:00.777 --> 06:03.170
Yentl knows Talmud?

06:03.654 --> 06:05.723
I think that's enough for today.

06:05.823 --> 06:09.551
My father says that a woman
who studies Talmud is a demon.

06:09.702 --> 06:12.272
She's not a demon.
She just has big ears.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.399
So you don't have to mention
this to your father.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.516
- Goodbye, Reb Mendel.
- Goodbye, goodbye.

06:17.752 --> 06:20.187
- Bye, David.
- See you tonight.

06:21.672 --> 06:23.658
Now you'll have the whole
village talking about us.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.493
Papa, you shouldn't be smoking.

06:25.593 --> 06:28.371
Do you think the angel of death will
be frightened away by cough medicine?

06:28.471 --> 06:29.571
Open.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.084
In the first place, you don't
have to drown him in it.

06:33.184 --> 06:34.377
Again.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.671
And in the second place,
I think he's beginning to like it.

06:36.771 --> 06:38.381
- Oh, you want some more?
- Yentl.

06:48.491 --> 06:52.802
You know something?
Baked apple is good a little burnt.

06:55.081 --> 06:59.027
- I'm sorry, Papa.
- No, no, no. I mean it. I like it this way.

06:59.127 --> 07:01.102
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

07:03.381 --> 07:05.565
Go on, your move.

07:06.384 --> 07:07.609
Papa?

07:08.761 --> 07:11.080
Why is it that every book I buy,
every bookseller who comes

07:11.180 --> 07:12.206
has the same old argument?

07:12.306 --> 07:16.210
- You know why.
- I envy them.

07:16.310 --> 07:19.547
- The booksellers?
- No, not the booksellers, the students.

07:19.647 --> 07:21.758
Talking about life,
the mysteries of the universe.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.551
And I'm learning how to
tell a herring from a carp.

07:23.651 --> 07:26.262
Yentl, for the thousandth time,
men and women

07:26.362 --> 07:28.931
- have different obligations.
- Have different obligations, I know, but...

07:29.031 --> 07:30.590
And don't ask why.

07:34.162 --> 07:36.304
Go on. Get the books.

07:38.207 --> 07:41.152
- Get the books.
- Thank you, Papa.

07:41.252 --> 07:44.822
- "Thank you, Papa. Thank you, Papa."
- Thank you.

07:44.922 --> 07:48.409
- The shutters, darling.
- The shutters.

07:48.509 --> 07:51.496
If we don't have to hide my studying
from God, then why from the neighbors?

07:51.596 --> 07:55.657
Why? Because I trust God will understand.
I'm not so sure about the neighbors.

07:55.892 --> 07:59.170
Questions, questions,
even when you were little.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.755
- "Does a goat have a soul?"
- Does it?

08:00.855 --> 08:03.206
- "What was before the universe?"
- I'd really like to know.

08:06.569 --> 08:10.390
- Where were we?
- We were up to Hillel's argument.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.258
Hillel's argument that knowledge...

08:14.368 --> 08:15.635
Papa?

08:17.705 --> 08:19.180
Papa?

08:19.290 --> 08:20.515
Oh.

08:21.083 --> 08:24.936
Papa, I'm a little tired tonight.

08:25.755 --> 08:28.565
Do you mind? We'll study tomorrow.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.445
Tomorrow.

08:34.554 --> 08:38.533
Oh, Yentl, Yentl. Oh, Yentl.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.837
You're such a comfort to me.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.755
But you should have a young
man to take care of you,

08:42.855 --> 08:45.707
preferably one who doesn't like to eat.

08:46.943 --> 08:49.011
- Good night, darling.
- Good night, Papa.

08:51.072 --> 08:53.798
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine. Fine, fine.

09:45.042 --> 09:49.062
God, our merciful father,

09:50.881 --> 09:53.274
I'm wrapped in a robe of light,

09:54.677 --> 09:56.861
clothed in your glory

09:57.847 --> 10:00.782
that spreads its wings over my soul.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.620
May I be worthy.

10:07.815 --> 10:13.211
Amen

10:18.367 --> 10:20.686
There's not a morning I begin

10:20.786 --> 10:27.267
Without a thousand questions
running through my mind

10:28.628 --> 10:32.990
That I don't try to find
the reason and the logic

10:33.090 --> 10:36.869
In the world that God designed

10:36.969 --> 10:39.288
The reason why

10:39.388 --> 10:44.325
A bird was given wings

10:44.477 --> 10:47.129
If not to fly

10:47.229 --> 10:49.549
And praise the sky

10:49.649 --> 10:54.502
With every song it sings

10:55.404 --> 10:58.006
What's right or wrong

10:58.407 --> 11:01.018
Where I belong

11:01.118 --> 11:07.974
Within the scheme of things

11:19.220 --> 11:22.415
And why have eyes that
see and arms that reach

11:22.515 --> 11:28.036
Unless you're meant to know
there's something more?

11:28.479 --> 11:35.177
If not to hunger for the meaning of it all
Then tell me what a soul is for

11:35.277 --> 11:41.716
Why have the wings unless
you're meant to fly?

11:41.992 --> 11:46.731
And tell me, please, why have a mind

11:46.831 --> 11:52.894
If not to question why?

11:53.129 --> 11:57.158
And tell me where

11:57.258 --> 12:02.079
Where is it written what
it is I'm meant to be

12:02.179 --> 12:05.082
That I can't dare

12:05.182 --> 12:10.254
To have the chance to pick
the fruit of every tree

12:10.354 --> 12:14.258
Or have my share

12:14.358 --> 12:18.920
Of every sweet imagined possibility?

12:20.156 --> 12:22.841
Just tell me where

12:24.994 --> 12:28.263
Tell me where

12:33.502 --> 12:35.696
If I were only meant to tend the nest

12:35.796 --> 12:41.150
Then why does my imagination sail

12:41.427 --> 12:43.704
Across the mountains and the seas

12:43.804 --> 12:48.000
Beyond the make-believe
of any fairy tale?

12:48.100 --> 12:53.422
Why have the thirst if
not to drink the wine?

12:53.522 --> 12:58.219
And what a waste to have a taste

12:58.319 --> 13:03.298
Of things that can't be mine

13:03.532 --> 13:07.269
And tell me where

13:07.369 --> 13:11.774
Where is it written what
it is I'm meant to be

13:11.874 --> 13:14.944
That I can't dare

13:15.044 --> 13:19.740
To find the meanings in
the mornings that I see

13:19.840 --> 13:24.203
Or have my share

13:24.303 --> 13:28.865
Of every sweet imagined possibility?

13:30.100 --> 13:31.085
Papa!

13:31.185 --> 13:33.870
Just tell me where

13:34.897 --> 13:38.708
Where is it written?

13:38.901 --> 13:42.054
Tell me where

13:42.154 --> 13:44.306
Are you all right?

13:44.406 --> 13:51.095
Or if it's written

13:53.999 --> 14:00.355
Anywhere

14:01.173 --> 14:02.491
Did you hear, Albert?

14:02.591 --> 14:04.702
- Yentl is learning Talmud.
- Learning Talmud?

14:04.802 --> 14:05.828
- That's impossible.
- It's true.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.164
- David's mother told me. He was there.
- It can't be.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.489
Better she should learn
how to get a husband.

14:11.838 --> 14:14.628
He came all the way
from Riga to see you.

14:14.728 --> 14:17.381
So, why, Yentl, why won't
you at least meet him?

14:17.481 --> 14:18.924
- What for?
- "What for?"

14:19.024 --> 14:21.886
I want to dance at your wedding.
I want to see you happy.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.512
I'm happy with you, Papa.

14:23.612 --> 14:25.514
- I don't want to get married now.
- I noticed.

14:25.614 --> 14:27.850
I don't want to just bear children
and darn my husband's socks.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.311
What is it you want?
A husband who will darn your socks?

14:30.411 --> 14:32.887
- Sounds interesting.
- And bear your children?

14:33.497 --> 14:36.150
Go on, turn the world
upside down and inside out.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.611
- You won't have a moment's peace.
- I didn't say I never wanted...

14:38.711 --> 14:41.229
Children are more important
than the Talmud.

14:41.422 --> 14:43.032
Without children to pass it on to,

14:43.132 --> 14:47.610
the learning, the studying, the Talmud
dies with old men when they die.

14:49.972 --> 14:52.875
- I'm sorry.
- I'm the one who's sorry.

14:52.975 --> 14:56.577
You're a woman, but I didn't
teach you how to be one.

14:57.646 --> 15:00.591
- You taught me everything I know.
- Too much you know.

15:00.691 --> 15:04.053
You know too much, but not enough.

15:04.153 --> 15:07.473
- And it's my fault.
- Papa, please, don't say that.

15:07.573 --> 15:11.634
Learning is my whole life.
Please don't be sorry. I'm not.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.728
- What is it?
- That tree.

15:24.340 --> 15:29.027
That tree was this high when your brother
Anshel died, may he rest in peace.

15:30.304 --> 15:35.033
You were only a baby,
could hardly talk, let alone ask, "Why?"

15:35.267 --> 15:38.244
And now, look, look how it's grown.

15:40.689 --> 15:43.583
Too late to tell you to play with dolls?

15:45.736 --> 15:48.671
- I love you, Papa.
- Please...

15:52.701 --> 15:56.313
Hear me, O Lord, master of the universe.

15:56.413 --> 15:59.441
Thou hast given me a daughter

15:59.541 --> 16:04.062
who brings me great pride and pleasure.

16:08.717 --> 16:13.029
And for this kindness,
I thank thee forever and ever.

16:16.558 --> 16:18.951
What's to become of you, Yentl?

16:44.086 --> 16:46.187
Come, Yentl.

16:48.090 --> 16:50.441
You must tear it over your heart.

16:51.927 --> 16:54.821
- Good.
- Who will say Kaddish?

16:55.472 --> 16:59.617
- I will.
- It has to be a man, Yentl, a male relative.

17:05.107 --> 17:07.250
May God forgive her.

17:18.454 --> 17:21.190
Listen, my house is hers
as long as she wants.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.025
So she'll help a little in the store,

17:23.125 --> 17:25.527
look after the children,
maybe do a little cooking...

17:25.627 --> 17:26.987
Yentl, eat.

17:28.839 --> 17:32.534
It's enough.
We mourn for seven days only.

17:32.634 --> 17:34.703
Then life goes on.

17:36.221 --> 17:37.572
Sorry.

17:41.685 --> 17:45.913
Razel, Sarah, I think
maybe we come back later.

17:46.106 --> 17:47.248
Yes.

17:47.983 --> 17:51.428
Get your things together, Yentl.
I'll come back for you later.

17:51.528 --> 17:54.223
Believe me, I'll keep you so busy,
you won't have time to think.

19:18.323 --> 19:20.049
Forgive me, Papa.

19:42.598 --> 19:43.999
Wait!

19:44.099 --> 19:45.626
- Wait! Stop!
- Whoa.

19:45.726 --> 19:48.670
- Please.
- What do you want, boy?

19:48.770 --> 19:50.798
Could you give me a ride
to the next town, please?

19:50.898 --> 19:54.041
- You got money?
- A little.

19:57.905 --> 20:00.006
- Get in back.
- Thank you.

20:02.117 --> 20:03.519
Say, where do you think you're going?

20:04.870 --> 20:06.188
- Get off of here.
- Wait!

20:06.288 --> 20:09.724
- Go find another wagon. Tomorrow.
- Wait! Please wait!

20:31.521 --> 20:38.085
God

20:39.238 --> 20:41.922
Our heavenly father

20:42.491 --> 20:49.263
O God

20:49.998 --> 20:53.351
And my father, who's also in heaven

20:54.920 --> 20:59.482
May the light of this flickering candle

21:00.592 --> 21:04.955
Illuminate the night,
the way your spirit

21:05.055 --> 21:12.078
Illuminates my soul

21:19.653 --> 21:23.964
Papa, can you hear me?

21:25.993 --> 21:28.719
Papa, can you see me?

21:29.705 --> 21:36.060
Papa, can you find me in the night?

21:37.045 --> 21:41.283
Papa, are you near me?
Papa, can you hear me?

21:41.383 --> 21:47.822
Papa, can you help me not be frightened?

21:48.598 --> 21:52.628
Looking at the skies
I seem to see a million eyes

21:52.728 --> 21:58.091
Which ones are yours?

21:58.191 --> 22:01.720
Where are you now that
yesterday has waved goodbye

22:01.820 --> 22:04.848
And closed its doors?

22:04.948 --> 22:08.685
The night is so much darker

22:08.785 --> 22:12.397
The wind is so much colder

22:12.497 --> 22:19.270
The world I see is so much
bigger now that I'm alone

22:21.256 --> 22:26.286
Papa, please forgive me
Try to understand me

22:26.386 --> 22:31.500
Papa, don't you know I had no choice?

22:31.600 --> 22:36.505
Can you hear me praying
Anything I'm saying

22:36.605 --> 22:42.469
Even though the night
is filled with voices?

22:42.569 --> 22:48.757
I remember everything you taught me
Every book I've ever read

22:52.537 --> 22:58.777
Can all the words in all the books
help me to face what lies ahead?

22:58.877 --> 23:05.608
The trees are so much taller
and I feel so much smaller

23:06.468 --> 23:09.288
The moon is twice as lonely

23:09.388 --> 23:14.867
And the stars are half as bright

23:17.646 --> 23:21.040
Papa, how I love you

23:22.359 --> 23:25.878
Papa, how I need you

23:26.613 --> 23:31.091
Papa, how I miss you

23:31.827 --> 23:36.898
Kissing me

23:36.998 --> 23:43.979
Good night

24:06.695 --> 24:10.130
If I am not for myself,
who will be for me?

24:11.283 --> 24:12.726
Who will be for me?

24:14.509 --> 24:16.229
Who will be for me?

24:16.329 --> 24:18.482
If I am for myself alone, who am I?

24:18.582 --> 24:19.932
Who am I?

24:21.168 --> 24:26.522
If not now, when?

24:29.843 --> 24:31.068
Wait!

25:29.569 --> 25:31.503
Innkeeper, more soup.

25:37.953 --> 25:41.847
- Did you hear that?
- Yes. I hear, I hear.

25:43.875 --> 25:46.685
- Who's throwing that?
- I need some more fish.

25:48.171 --> 25:51.366
- Don't throw that. I told you not to.
- Watch out!

25:51.466 --> 25:53.869
Lithuania, Poland,
all yeshivas are the same.

25:53.969 --> 25:55.370
A school is a school.

25:55.470 --> 25:59.198
I mean, it's only the rabbis
that are different. I mean, the girls...

26:02.102 --> 26:05.797
- Why would the Talmud repeat itself, why?
- Because it's an improper translation.

26:05.897 --> 26:10.051
- Even if they contradict each other?
- Avigdor, what do you think?

26:10.151 --> 26:13.253
The Talmud recognizes life
is filled with contradiction.

26:13.488 --> 26:15.589
- You see? He agrees with me.
- Your move.

26:16.449 --> 26:17.642
Two beers.

26:17.742 --> 26:19.968
I can hear you.
I only have two hands.

26:21.329 --> 26:22.680
What?

26:22.831 --> 26:25.766
- Nothing, sorry.
- No, go on.

26:27.544 --> 26:32.699
It's just that if you move
your castle to queen seven...

26:32.799 --> 26:36.276
- Yes?
- His knight is pinned. That's all.

26:37.304 --> 26:39.581
You don't know what
you're talking about.

26:39.681 --> 26:41.281
No. Sorry.

26:42.851 --> 26:46.787
- Stop yelling at me, Papa.
- I'm not yelling! I'm not yelling!

26:50.275 --> 26:51.709
Checkmate.

26:54.321 --> 26:58.215
- The long diagonal. Who knew?
- You should've listened to him.

26:58.908 --> 26:59.976
Pay up.

27:00.076 --> 27:02.437
Chaim, catch.

27:02.537 --> 27:05.440
- You want a bite?
- No, thank you.

27:05.540 --> 27:09.319
- Don't play.
- Hey, you. You.

27:09.419 --> 27:11.437
- Sit down.
- Why?

27:12.922 --> 27:15.107
Because I said so. Sit.

27:17.594 --> 27:21.122
Five kopecks if you win.
You pay me one if you lose.

27:21.222 --> 27:23.416
What do I have to do?

27:23.516 --> 27:25.752
Whoever forces the other's
hand to the table wins.

27:25.852 --> 27:28.495
- Oh, no, thanks.
- Ready? Go.

27:30.273 --> 27:34.803
Wasn't it Rabbi Akiva who said,
"The true strength of a man..."

27:34.903 --> 27:37.129
One kopeck.

27:37.906 --> 27:40.850
"...lies in his ability to stretch even
the narrowest mind"? Thank you.

27:40.950 --> 27:45.345
You're welcome. Now you
can stretch my mind again.

27:45.914 --> 27:47.691
- Go.
- Well,

27:47.791 --> 27:50.360
I think Rabbi Akiva also said...

27:50.460 --> 27:52.186
Two kopecks.

27:52.754 --> 27:56.023
- I thought it was one.
- But I beat you twice.

27:56.341 --> 27:57.691
Oh.

27:59.010 --> 28:01.361
Give him back his money.

28:02.722 --> 28:04.573
- Why?
- Because I said so.

28:05.058 --> 28:07.159
Because you said so.

28:07.977 --> 28:11.955
I'll see you later when your beard
starts to grow. Mama's boy.

28:14.651 --> 28:17.169
No, it wasn't, since you asked.

28:17.362 --> 28:20.214
Rabbi Akiva, "The narrowest mind."

28:22.450 --> 28:25.812
- Was it Rabbi Eliezer?
- No, it was Rabbi Israel Salanter.

28:25.912 --> 28:28.231
Rabbi Israel Salanter.

28:28.331 --> 28:30.275
By the way, my brother
didn't have one, either.

28:30.375 --> 28:31.850
What?

28:34.003 --> 28:35.947
- Are you hungry?
- A little.

28:36.047 --> 28:39.326
- Help yourself.
- Yes, please. Help yourself.

28:39.426 --> 28:45.582
- Which yeshiva are you going to?
- I haven't decided. Someplace quiet.

28:45.682 --> 28:47.074
A quiet yeshiva?

28:47.392 --> 28:50.003
- Bechev's the best.
- Well, the nearest.

28:50.103 --> 28:53.006
That's where we study.
Everybody else studies.

28:53.106 --> 28:54.841
Me, I just count the days
till I go home again.

28:54.941 --> 28:57.844
And his parents count the days
till they can send him back again.

28:57.944 --> 29:01.964
Our rabbi's a genius. Rabbi Zalman.
Maybe you've heard of him?

29:03.032 --> 29:05.852
- I think so.
- In one answer, he settles 10 questions.

29:05.952 --> 29:08.229
My father had 10 questions
for every answer.

29:08.329 --> 29:09.689
Had?

29:09.789 --> 29:13.100
He died eight days ago,
may he rest in peace.

29:15.336 --> 29:18.772
- You're in mourning, too.
- My brother.

29:19.799 --> 29:23.569
Almost a month now.
May he rest in peace.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.614
I'm Shimmele, by the way.

29:28.516 --> 29:30.701
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

29:31.686 --> 29:34.756
- And you?
- What?

29:34.856 --> 29:37.040
What's your name?

29:38.526 --> 29:40.252
- My name?
- Name.

29:46.034 --> 29:50.814
Anshel. That's it. That's my name.
My name is Anshel.

29:50.914 --> 29:55.475
Well, good. You know your own name.
You're as good a scholar as I am.

29:55.877 --> 29:57.978
- This is Avigdor.
- I know.

29:59.255 --> 30:01.408
- I mean, hello.
- Boys!

30:01.508 --> 30:05.161
Wagons to the north
and west leaving now.

30:05.261 --> 30:09.249
- And now means now.
- Goodbye.

30:09.349 --> 30:11.408
Bye, Anshel, nice meeting you.

30:11.559 --> 30:13.201
Come on, then. We don't want to be late.

30:24.072 --> 30:25.932
Anshel!

30:26.032 --> 30:30.844
- Hey, are you deaf? Anshel!
- Anshel. Yes?

30:31.037 --> 30:33.481
There's a spare seat in the wagon
if you're still undecided.

30:33.581 --> 30:35.265
I just decided.

30:42.257 --> 30:46.244
In Plzen there's a fisherman
who's got the strongest rod

30:46.344 --> 30:50.165
The cod he catches are so big and
when they see his cod they scream

30:50.265 --> 30:52.783
Where you from, Anshel?

30:53.601 --> 30:56.203
A little village you've
probably never heard of. Yanev.

30:56.354 --> 30:59.841
Yanev? I have relatives in Yanev,
a third cousin.

30:59.941 --> 31:01.843
- We moved.
- What?

31:01.943 --> 31:04.169
Years ago.

31:04.612 --> 31:07.506
- You have relatives in Riga?
- Riga?

31:08.449 --> 31:11.343
- No.
- Now we live in Riga.

31:11.578 --> 31:12.719
Oh.

31:20.044 --> 31:21.029
Were you close?

31:21.129 --> 31:22.739
Well, he was my father and my teacher.

31:22.839 --> 31:25.950
- What more could you ask for?
- What about your brother?

31:26.050 --> 31:28.286
- We were brothers.
- Older? Younger?

31:28.386 --> 31:31.238
- Younger, about your age.
- What happened?

31:31.639 --> 31:34.241
- Pneumonia.
- Sorry.

31:38.187 --> 31:41.674
Would you like to discuss
a page of Talmud?

31:41.774 --> 31:44.084
- Oh, no, not Talmud.
- Which?

31:44.319 --> 31:47.754
- Whatever you're reading.
- I'll state the premise. You dispute it.

31:48.156 --> 31:49.423
You know it by heart?

31:56.706 --> 31:58.233
When does day become night?

31:58.333 --> 31:59.275
- Sundown.
- When is sundown?

31:59.375 --> 32:01.986
Sundown is when you can see
the first three stars in the sky.

32:02.086 --> 32:03.488
- That's not precise enough.
- Why?

32:03.588 --> 32:04.572
When's dusk?

32:04.672 --> 32:06.574
- Dusk is when the light's no longer blue.
- That's twilight.

32:06.674 --> 32:08.451
No, twilight is when all
objects are silhouettes.

32:08.551 --> 32:11.788
Will you be quiet for five minutes?
You're not even in the yeshiva yet.

32:11.888 --> 32:15.198
There's Bechev! We're home!

32:23.858 --> 32:25.718
How do I get into this yeshiva?

32:25.818 --> 32:26.761
Rabbi Zalman tests you

32:26.861 --> 32:29.430
on what you know or what
you think you know.

32:29.530 --> 32:33.101
- I'll arrange a meeting tomorrow.
- Will I be able to live at this yeshiva?

32:33.201 --> 32:36.229
Not at this one.
Don't worry, you'll find lodgings.

32:36.329 --> 32:40.316
There may be a room where I stay.
We'll ask.

32:40.416 --> 32:42.517
- I'm starving.
- You're always starving.

32:43.586 --> 32:46.072
- Wait for me.
- Come on, you're walking too slow.

32:46.172 --> 32:47.490
You're walking too fast.

32:47.590 --> 32:49.450
The synagogue's down
the street to the left.

32:49.550 --> 32:52.986
The yeshiva's straight ahead.
I live right around this corner.

32:54.722 --> 32:57.282
- Who is it?
- It's me.

32:57.684 --> 33:01.296
- Avigdor?
- How many other boyfriends do you have?

33:01.396 --> 33:04.289
I'm so glad you're back.

33:04.482 --> 33:06.092
- Are you all right?
- Yes, yes, of course.

33:06.192 --> 33:08.636
Well, as soon as you see Hadass,
you'll feel better.

33:08.736 --> 33:12.807
- Who wants other girls when I've got you?
- What a shame, a wicked tongue.

33:12.907 --> 33:14.851
I want you to meet a
friend of mine, Anshel.

33:14.951 --> 33:18.261
- Anshel, Mrs. Jacobs.
- Good evening, Mrs. Jacobs.

33:19.622 --> 33:22.317
- Anshel?
- I told him that you'd have a room for him.

33:22.417 --> 33:24.652
Oh, I'm sorry, dear, not tonight.

33:24.752 --> 33:27.864
My niece is here from Latvia,
but she leaves tomorrow.

33:27.964 --> 33:29.908
It's all right.
For one night, he can share my bed.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.859
- No, I can't.
- Why not?

33:34.762 --> 33:36.456
- I don't want to impose.
- Don't be silly.

33:36.556 --> 33:40.617
- Anyway, I'm a restless sleeper.
- That's all right. I snore.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.202
Come on.

33:46.899 --> 33:48.208
Young.

33:55.950 --> 33:58.552
Anshel, will you put out the lamp?

33:59.787 --> 34:02.941
I can't. I'm being tested
by the rabbi tomorrow.

34:03.041 --> 34:07.111
So? You're going to learn the
entire Talmud by heart overnight?

34:07.211 --> 34:09.646
All 2,555 pages?

34:09.755 --> 34:12.241
- You're tired, you sleep.
- I'm not tired, I'm exhausted.

34:12.341 --> 34:16.277
I've been bouncing around in a wagon
all day long. All I want to do is sleep.

34:16.804 --> 34:18.539
Get in bed.

34:18.639 --> 34:20.833
- Would you like to talk a little before...
- Bed.

34:20.933 --> 34:24.536
- Why don't I just put the light...
- Get in bed.

34:40.119 --> 34:42.304
So...

34:43.164 --> 34:45.974
Who's Hadass?

34:47.251 --> 34:50.071
- Mrs. Jacobs mentioned somebody...
- For God's sake.

34:50.170 --> 34:53.565
Sorry. I'm sorry. It doesn't matter.
Go back to sleep.

34:54.300 --> 34:56.484
The girl I'm engaged to.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.320
Oh.

34:59.931 --> 35:01.406
Sorry.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.783
Oh, it's your suitcase.

35:11.150 --> 35:16.504
- Is she pretty, this Hadass?
- No. Beautiful.

35:23.037 --> 35:24.355
What color hair does she have?

35:24.455 --> 35:27.974
Look, I have dinner at her house
every Tuesday. I'll take you.

35:30.044 --> 35:31.487
Thank you.

35:35.216 --> 35:39.027
- Red.
- Red?

35:39.178 --> 35:41.738
- Now, will you get into bed?
- Sure.

36:02.702 --> 36:04.844
You'll fall off the edge.

36:06.789 --> 36:09.233
I always sleep like this.

36:09.333 --> 36:11.893
- Why?
- Why?

36:13.546 --> 36:15.647
I think it's written.

36:16.841 --> 36:18.201
What is?

36:18.301 --> 36:21.736
Two bachelors in the same
bed must lie back to back.

36:23.347 --> 36:26.116
- Really?
- Really. So turn over, please.

36:38.112 --> 36:43.049
Why'd you have to talk about Hadass?
Now I'll never get to sleep.

36:44.076 --> 36:48.481
- Why not?
- Don't you ever think sinful thoughts?

36:48.581 --> 36:50.316
- No.
- No?

36:50.416 --> 36:52.600
- Yes!
- Don't be so nervous.

36:52.960 --> 36:55.103
Why should I be nervous?

36:56.214 --> 36:58.866
You're being tested by
the rabbi tomorrow.

37:03.429 --> 37:04.904
Good night.

37:06.807 --> 37:07.907
Good night.

37:17.735 --> 37:19.252
I'll see you in class, okay?

37:22.990 --> 37:25.726
No, Anshel, the whole point of study

37:25.826 --> 37:28.104
is to teach us how to live,
not only to study.

37:28.204 --> 37:30.398
- But why?
- "Why? Why?" Again, "Why?"

37:30.498 --> 37:34.068
No, I mean, excuse me, but my father
used to quote Hillel, who said... May I?

37:34.168 --> 37:37.780
- Hillel said, "May I?"
- No, I mean, may I quote Hillel?

37:37.880 --> 37:39.282
Quote, quote.

37:39.382 --> 37:42.118
Well, Hillel said, "He that
increases wisdom increases life."

37:42.218 --> 37:43.244
- Exactly.
- Meaning that

37:43.344 --> 37:44.620
wisdom is the most important thing.

37:44.720 --> 37:49.458
Only as the means to an end.
Wisdom is the means. Living is the end.

37:49.558 --> 37:52.712
Well, in that case, may I
ask you another question?

37:52.812 --> 37:54.630
Ask, ask.

37:54.730 --> 37:56.007
Well, if Hillel said,

37:56.107 --> 37:57.717
"He that increases study
increases wisdom,

37:57.817 --> 37:59.918
"and he that increases wisdom
increases life," then...

38:00.027 --> 38:01.262
- Grab it.
- You can't just grab it.

38:01.362 --> 38:03.097
- You're supposed to...
- No, that's not it.

38:03.197 --> 38:04.348
You can do it, so long as...

38:04.448 --> 38:07.059
That's why Rabbi Akiva says
you must use the left side.

38:07.159 --> 38:08.259
No, I disagree.

38:08.494 --> 38:12.472
- Well?
- I don't know. He just said to me...

38:13.541 --> 38:17.361
- He asks a lot of questions, this one.
- I'm sorry, I've been told that before.

38:17.461 --> 38:20.740
It's by their questions that
we choose our students,

38:20.840 --> 38:23.492
not only by their answers.

38:23.592 --> 38:28.613
Your father taught you well, Anshel.
Welcome to our yeshiva.

38:29.557 --> 38:31.157
I'm accepted?

38:32.852 --> 38:33.794
I'm a student?

38:35.521 --> 38:39.624
- I'm a student.
- And now, a study partner for him.

38:44.155 --> 38:49.426
There are moments you
remember all your life

38:51.120 --> 38:58.143
There are moments you wait
for and dream of all your life

39:00.421 --> 39:05.191
This is one of those moments

39:06.761 --> 39:12.407
I will always remember
this chair that window

39:12.683 --> 39:17.871
The way the light streams in

39:18.022 --> 39:19.507
He's too advanced for them.

39:19.607 --> 39:22.333
The clothes I'm wearing

39:23.235 --> 39:25.012
The words I'm hearing

39:25.112 --> 39:26.681
Too advanced for Yessel and Berish.

39:26.781 --> 39:28.349
The face I'm seeing

39:28.449 --> 39:29.517
So who?

39:29.617 --> 39:31.477
The feeling I'm feeling

39:31.577 --> 39:33.729
- Me?
- You?

39:33.829 --> 39:34.814
The smell, the sounds

39:34.914 --> 39:36.899
My chickens are too advanced for you.

39:36.999 --> 39:38.734
Will be written on my mind

39:38.834 --> 39:41.737
- Thank you.
- Avigdor?

39:41.837 --> 39:44.615
Will be written in my heart

39:44.715 --> 39:47.233
There's only me who is
too advanced for him.

39:49.387 --> 39:50.538
It's up to you.

39:50.638 --> 39:53.749
As long as I live

39:53.849 --> 39:54.949
We'll see.

39:57.061 --> 40:03.041
I can travel the past and take what
I need to see me through the years

40:03.275 --> 40:06.304
What my father learned
and his father before him

40:06.404 --> 40:09.307
Will be there for my eyes and ears

40:09.407 --> 40:12.268
I can walk through the forests
of the trees of knowledge

40:12.368 --> 40:15.178
And listen to the lesson of the leaves

40:15.287 --> 40:18.482
I can enter rooms where there
are rooms within rooms

40:18.582 --> 40:23.770
Wrapped in a shawl that learning weaves
I remember, Papa

40:24.004 --> 40:29.827
Everything you've taught me
What you gave me, Papa

40:29.927 --> 40:33.080
Look at what it's brought me

40:33.180 --> 40:36.083
There are certain things
that once you have

40:36.183 --> 40:41.756
No man can take away
No wave can wash away

40:41.856 --> 40:44.508
No wind can blow away

40:44.608 --> 40:50.171
And now they're about to be mine

40:50.531 --> 40:56.094
No tide can turn away
No fire can burn away

40:56.454 --> 40:59.889
No time can wear away

41:12.511 --> 41:17.865
I can open doors, take from the shelves
all the books I've longed to hold

41:18.184 --> 41:21.003
I can ask all the questions
the whys and the wheres

41:21.103 --> 41:23.589
As the mysteries of life unfold

41:23.689 --> 41:27.009
Like a link in a chain from
the past to the future

41:27.109 --> 41:32.839
Joins me with the children yet to be I
can now be a part of the ongoing stream

41:33.073 --> 41:37.260
That has always been a part of me

41:38.412 --> 41:41.357
There are certain things
that once you have

41:41.457 --> 41:47.270
No man can take away
No wave can wash away

41:47.713 --> 41:50.648
No wind can blow away

41:51.675 --> 41:52.993
Anshel, come down.

41:53.093 --> 41:56.872
No tide can turn away
No fire can burn away

41:56.972 --> 42:00.325
No time can wear away

42:01.310 --> 42:05.121
Where in the Talmud does it say,
"Possession is nine-tenths of the law"?

42:07.233 --> 42:09.125
Shimmele.

42:10.528 --> 42:11.595
- Yebamoth?
- No.

42:11.695 --> 42:14.714
- No, it's not Yebamoth. It's Bava Metzia.
- No.

42:15.282 --> 42:18.009
- It's Bava Kama, page 29A.
- No.

42:18.244 --> 42:21.054
Forgive me.
It's Bava Kama, but it's 31B?

42:21.664 --> 42:23.357
Anshel is right.

42:23.457 --> 42:26.893
There are moments you
remember all your life

42:28.212 --> 42:34.984
There are moments you wait
for and dream of all your life

42:37.137 --> 42:43.910
This is one of those moments

43:36.947 --> 43:38.297
Perfect.

43:42.369 --> 43:43.845
Beautiful.

43:47.374 --> 43:51.602
So, congratulations, Anshel.
Accepted in a fine yeshiva.

43:51.920 --> 43:54.615
- Your father would be proud.
- I hope so.

43:54.715 --> 43:55.699
Sure.

43:55.799 --> 43:59.203
- I understand he was a scholar, too?
- Yes, yes, he was.

43:59.303 --> 44:02.957
Now his son after him.
May your father rest in peace.

44:03.057 --> 44:04.625
- May he rest in peace.
- May he rest in peace.

44:04.725 --> 44:07.243
Avigdor's brother, too. He told you?

44:07.936 --> 44:11.998
- Yes, he did.
- Consumption, a terrible thing.

44:12.566 --> 44:14.134
Esther!

44:14.234 --> 44:17.429
- At our table, two scholars waiting.
- I'm coming.

44:17.529 --> 44:21.174
I'd like to have a toast
to the new yeshiva boy.

44:23.911 --> 44:25.470
Such an honor.

44:25.704 --> 44:28.983
- How is the fish, boys?
- Delicious.

44:29.083 --> 44:31.569
- Hadass made it herself.
- It's Avigdor's favorite.

44:31.669 --> 44:34.187
I hope so. We get it every Tuesday.

44:35.005 --> 44:38.158
I mean, it's very good. It's good fish.

44:38.258 --> 44:42.528
You have a lovely home, Mrs. Vishkower.

44:42.638 --> 44:47.876
Such beautiful things, the silver,
the dishes, the tablecloth.

44:47.976 --> 44:50.838
Thank you, Anshel.
It's nice of you to notice.

44:50.938 --> 44:53.080
Oh. I'm sorry.

44:54.108 --> 44:56.042
It's all right.

44:58.237 --> 45:00.598
You... You come from a big family?

45:00.698 --> 45:03.434
- No.
- No brothers or sisters?

45:03.534 --> 45:05.644
- No.
- And your father never remarried?

45:05.744 --> 45:07.813
- No.
- Esther.

45:07.913 --> 45:10.858
Well, I'm just curious.
I mean, who took care of them?

45:10.958 --> 45:15.195
If I knew Talmud the way my wife knows
everybody's business, God bless her,

45:15.295 --> 45:17.522
I'd be the sage of all sages.

45:18.549 --> 45:20.618
Don't you pay any attention to him.

45:20.718 --> 45:25.071
No wonder he loves her

45:26.390 --> 45:29.909
No wonder at all

45:31.478 --> 45:34.831
The moment she sees him

45:35.357 --> 45:38.969
Her thought is to please him

45:39.069 --> 45:40.596
Horseradish is good for you.

45:40.696 --> 45:44.674
Before he even knows that he's hungry
she's already there with his plate

45:44.992 --> 45:46.894
Before his glass is even empty

45:46.994 --> 45:49.428
She's filling it up
God forbid he should wait

45:49.663 --> 45:53.275
Before he has the chance to tell her
he's chilly, she'll go put a log on the fire

45:53.375 --> 45:55.518
- Anshel?
- Anshel.

45:56.295 --> 45:59.605
Fulfilling his every desire

45:59.757 --> 46:00.940
More bread, please.

46:01.133 --> 46:02.159
No trouble

46:02.259 --> 46:03.243
Yes, more bread.

46:03.343 --> 46:05.537
No bother

46:05.637 --> 46:07.456
- Carrots?
- No, thank you.

46:07.556 --> 46:12.836
No wonder she's pretty

46:12.936 --> 46:17.331
What else should she be?

46:17.524 --> 46:21.553
She hasn't a worry

46:21.653 --> 46:25.506
And why should she worry?

46:26.074 --> 46:29.886
When she gets up, her biggest
decision is figuring out what to wear

46:30.037 --> 46:32.439
To pick a blouse, a skirt
And then there's the problem

46:32.539 --> 46:34.149
Of what should she do with her hair

46:34.249 --> 46:36.985
And later as she stands
and studies a chicken

46:37.085 --> 46:40.396
The question's to roast or to not roast

46:41.215 --> 46:44.984
Or better yet, maybe a pot roast

46:45.135 --> 46:48.247
Tomatoes? No

46:48.347 --> 46:50.364
Potatoes.

46:51.016 --> 46:55.796
No wonder he likes it

46:55.896 --> 46:59.665
It's perfect this way

46:59.817 --> 47:02.803
Who wouldn't want someone
who fusses and flatters

47:02.903 --> 47:05.472
Who makes you feel that
you're all that matters

47:05.572 --> 47:08.892
Whose only aim in life is to serve you

47:08.992 --> 47:14.597
And make you think she
doesn't deserve you?

47:15.666 --> 47:17.151
No wonder he loves her

47:17.251 --> 47:20.853
It's all right. It happens.

47:22.047 --> 47:23.699
All the time.

47:23.799 --> 47:26.400
What else could he do?

47:27.219 --> 47:30.488
If I were a man

47:32.266 --> 47:35.461
I would, too

47:35.561 --> 47:38.255
- Let's try dessert.
- Yes, Mother.

47:38.355 --> 47:39.497
Good?

47:42.609 --> 47:44.794
Let's go this way.

47:46.238 --> 47:47.973
She makes the best
almond cakes, doesn't she?

47:49.616 --> 47:52.218
I thought it was pneumonia.

47:52.911 --> 47:55.137
- Your brother.
- It was.

47:55.998 --> 47:58.683
- Vishkower said consumption.
- Did he?

48:00.127 --> 48:02.946
They were very impressed
with you in there.

48:03.046 --> 48:04.948
"Beautiful dishes, beautiful home."

48:07.301 --> 48:11.153
I didn't open my mouth the first
two months I went, except to eat.

48:12.973 --> 48:14.875
Is she always that nervous?

48:14.975 --> 48:19.328
She's a girl in love.
What do you expect?

48:20.480 --> 48:24.083
- She doesn't say very much, does she?
- What does she have to say?

48:25.527 --> 48:28.879
Don't you ever wonder
what she's thinking?

48:29.156 --> 48:32.008
No. What could she be thinking?

48:33.368 --> 48:36.095
Anyway, I don't need her to think.
I can do that with you.

48:37.456 --> 48:39.233
You're wrong, Avigdor.
It's a mistranslation.

48:39.333 --> 48:41.902
The Hebrew for rib never meant rib.
It meant side.

48:42.002 --> 48:44.488
- Rib, side, what's the difference?
- All the difference in the world.

48:44.588 --> 48:46.240
Since Adam was created
both male and female...

48:46.340 --> 48:48.534
- Where's that written?
- Genesis, chapter five, verse two.

48:48.634 --> 48:51.745
And if God took one side of Adam
and not his rib and created woman,

48:51.845 --> 48:54.748
that means they're the same.
We all are, everybody is. Don't you see?

48:54.848 --> 48:56.667
What I see is you've
never been with a woman.

48:56.767 --> 48:59.044
What I mean is that they share
masculine and feminine qualities

48:59.144 --> 49:00.504
since they come from the same source.

49:00.604 --> 49:03.257
- Look, can you do that?
- What?

49:03.357 --> 49:06.218
Create life, give birth to sons?

49:06.318 --> 49:08.178
When you can do that,
then you tell me we're the same.

49:08.278 --> 49:09.680
- Give me back my book.
- Another interpretation,

49:09.780 --> 49:11.306
the true story of Adam and Eve,
Genesis Rabba 18.

49:11.406 --> 49:13.600
God didn't make her from Adam's
ear lest she be an eavesdropper.

49:13.700 --> 49:16.552
- Come on, please.
- Nor from his foot lest she be a wanderer.

49:17.079 --> 49:18.480
Nor from his heart,
so she wouldn't be jealous.

49:18.580 --> 49:19.648
Must you talk with your hands?

49:19.748 --> 49:21.275
But from a hidden part of
the body, so she'd be modest.

49:21.375 --> 49:22.734
- Stop it.
- Like my Hadass.

49:22.834 --> 49:25.571
- In other words, the rib.
- No, not the rib. Not the rib, ox head,

49:25.671 --> 49:28.448
- side! Side!
- Rib! Rib!

49:28.548 --> 49:32.777
- Side!
- Rib, rib. Admit it. Admit you're wrong.

49:33.011 --> 49:37.323
- Admit it! Admit it!
- I will not. I'm not wrong.

49:37.516 --> 49:40.460
- Admit it!
- Get off me. I can't breathe.

49:40.560 --> 49:44.330
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

49:48.902 --> 49:51.045
Come on.

49:54.658 --> 49:57.051
- Where are you going?
- Come on!

49:59.788 --> 50:01.764
Avigdor, wait.

50:05.085 --> 50:06.486
Avigdor!

50:14.553 --> 50:17.238
- Avigdor, where are you?
- Over here!

50:20.434 --> 50:23.327
- Come on in.
- Oh, my God.

50:28.859 --> 50:30.376
That's a bit funny, though.

50:35.615 --> 50:38.185
- Come on in!
- No.

50:38.285 --> 50:40.062
There's a passage here that...

50:40.162 --> 50:43.523
- It's the only way to cool off.
- No, it's all right.

50:43.623 --> 50:47.235
I'll... I'll watch the clothes.

50:47.335 --> 50:50.980
- Don't throw me in the water.
- Look at this fish I've caught.

50:56.970 --> 50:59.780
- Shimmele, come on in.
- Shimmele, come on in.

51:08.857 --> 51:12.543
- Hey, Avigdor, how's the water?
- It's good. It's fun.

51:12.819 --> 51:15.296
It feels wonderful.

51:16.698 --> 51:19.258
- You're really missing something.
- Am I?

51:20.535 --> 51:22.928
- The water's perfect.
- Is it?

51:23.997 --> 51:26.233
- Here, your pants.
- What a day.

51:26.333 --> 51:29.310
- Put on your pants.
- What a pleasure.

51:30.253 --> 51:32.906
- It must be a sin.
- It couldn't be.

51:33.006 --> 51:35.608
Anshel! Come on in.

51:35.842 --> 51:39.737
- That's enough studying.
- No, no, it's too cold.

51:40.263 --> 51:43.449
- The water's warm.
- No, I catch cold easily.

51:43.683 --> 51:45.168
- That's not the reason.
- It's not?

51:45.268 --> 51:47.379
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What? What? Tell you what?

51:47.479 --> 51:48.787
You can't swim.

51:49.397 --> 51:53.176
I can't swim. That's right. I can't swim.
I can't swim, Shimmele!

51:53.276 --> 51:56.972
Neither can I. That's why I
stay where it's shallow.

51:57.072 --> 51:59.266
- Come on, Anshel. I'll teach you.
- No. No, no.

51:59.366 --> 52:00.726
- Don't be afraid.
- I don't really want to learn.

52:00.826 --> 52:02.269
- I'll hold you.
- No. I don't like swimming.

52:02.369 --> 52:03.937
- Take off your clothes. I'll hold you.
- No. Stop it.

52:04.037 --> 52:05.313
- Take your clothes off.
- No, no.

52:05.413 --> 52:06.982
- You're gonna get all wet. Oh, stop it.
- Please, stop it.

52:07.082 --> 52:09.600
- Are you ashamed? Embarrassed?
- I don't want to.

52:09.876 --> 52:11.945
- All right, all right.
- I don't want to. Stop it!

52:12.045 --> 52:15.648
All right, all right.
If you're that scared...

52:19.219 --> 52:20.945
I'm not going to force you.

52:22.472 --> 52:24.740
- Next time.
- Sure.

52:25.517 --> 52:27.701
When you're ready.

52:35.318 --> 52:40.714
There's no chill and yet I shiver

52:41.658 --> 52:46.354
There's no flame and yet I burn

52:46.454 --> 52:50.859
I'm not sure what I'm afraid of

52:50.959 --> 52:57.189
And yet I'm trembling

52:59.259 --> 53:03.413
There's no storm, yet I hear thunder

53:03.513 --> 53:06.792
And I'm breathless, why, I wonder

53:06.892 --> 53:13.831
Weak one moment, then the next I'm fine

53:14.274 --> 53:18.595
I feel as if I'm falling
every time I close my eyes

53:18.695 --> 53:23.892
And flowing through my body
is a river of surprise

53:23.992 --> 53:26.353
Feelings are awakening

53:26.453 --> 53:33.392
I hardly recognize as mine

53:40.550 --> 53:44.778
What are all these new sensations?

53:45.639 --> 53:50.377
What's the secret they reveal?

53:50.477 --> 53:55.590
I'm not sure I understand

53:55.690 --> 54:02.588
But I like the way I feel

54:39.526 --> 54:43.847
Oh, why is it that every time
I close my eyes he's there?

54:43.947 --> 54:48.101
The water shining on his skin
the sunlight in his hair

54:48.201 --> 54:50.770
And all the while I'm thinking things

54:50.870 --> 54:56.975
That I can never share with him

55:04.634 --> 55:09.279
I'm a bundle of confusion

55:10.223 --> 55:15.035
Yet it has a strange appeal

55:15.687 --> 55:21.134
Did it all begin with him

55:21.234 --> 55:28.257
And the way he makes me feel?

55:38.835 --> 55:42.322
I like the way

55:42.422 --> 55:49.361
He makes me

55:49.637 --> 55:56.577
Feel

56:24.464 --> 56:27.867
Which is the greater crime,
stealing by day or by night?

56:27.967 --> 56:30.527
- By day.
- By night.

56:39.145 --> 56:41.715
- What's wrong?
- That's what I want to know.

56:41.815 --> 56:44.926
Every morning, by the time we reach here,
you've exhausted the five books of Moses,

56:45.026 --> 56:47.595
the six orders of the Mishnah,
the seven wonders of the world

56:47.695 --> 56:51.308
and the entire mystery of the universe.
This morning, not a word. What's wrong?

56:51.408 --> 56:54.227
- Nothing.
- Just like my brother.

56:54.327 --> 56:58.690
In a little world of your own half the time.
Not saying what's on your mind, moody.

56:58.790 --> 57:00.817
- Who's moody?
- Worried about something?

57:00.917 --> 57:02.068
- No.
- Studies?

57:02.168 --> 57:03.570
- Nothing, Avigdor.
- I'm your study partner.

57:03.670 --> 57:05.405
- You should tell me if you are.
- I'm not.

57:05.505 --> 57:07.407
With me sitting next to you,
what have you got to worry about?

57:07.507 --> 57:08.700
- Please.
- I know what's wrong.

57:08.800 --> 57:09.909
Come on, I'll take you
to the matchmaker.

57:10.009 --> 57:11.953
- It'll put you in a better mood.
- I'm not going to a matchmaker.

57:12.053 --> 57:14.289
Give you something soft
and round and sweet.

57:14.389 --> 57:16.323
Excuse me, gentlemen.

57:17.725 --> 57:21.828
- Thank you, Sophie.
- Avigdor, please.

57:23.523 --> 57:25.425
My future father-in-law
would like to see me.

57:25.525 --> 57:26.843
Well, we're eating there tonight.

57:26.943 --> 57:28.803
- He wants to see me now.
- What for?

57:28.903 --> 57:32.265
Dowry, wedding ceremony,
the wedding night.

57:32.365 --> 57:35.467
- Why do you keep grabbing me?
- What?

57:36.661 --> 57:38.804
You're always grabbing me.

57:40.081 --> 57:42.307
- No, I'm not.
- Well, yes, you are.

57:43.501 --> 57:46.144
So? Everything has to have a reason?

57:50.091 --> 57:51.900
The wedding night!

58:21.498 --> 58:24.349
- Hello, Sophie. Is Avigdor here?
- Hello.

58:25.919 --> 58:29.313
He... Excuse me.

58:44.354 --> 58:46.163
What's wrong?

58:47.524 --> 58:49.008
What's the matter?

58:49.108 --> 58:50.427
Anshel, I'm sorry.

58:50.527 --> 58:53.388
You're still welcome here,
no matter what's happened.

58:53.488 --> 58:56.266
Sophie will get you something to eat.

58:56.366 --> 58:58.592
Where's Avigdor?

58:59.202 --> 59:01.553
Excuse me, Reb Alter, but...

59:02.539 --> 59:05.390
Hadass, sweetheart, try to understand.

59:12.465 --> 59:13.815
Avigdor.

59:14.551 --> 59:16.401
I just came from...

59:18.471 --> 59:21.657
- What happened?
- The wedding's off.

59:23.560 --> 59:24.743
Why?

59:25.853 --> 59:27.714
He says I have the evil eye.

59:27.814 --> 59:30.008
Says a streak of melancholy
runs in our blood.

59:30.108 --> 59:31.259
What are you saying?

59:31.359 --> 59:34.721
No man can let his daughter
marry into a family like that.

59:34.821 --> 59:36.505
It's forbidden.

59:37.240 --> 59:39.966
Avigdor, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

59:40.076 --> 59:42.520
- They found out.
- What?

59:42.620 --> 59:45.064
- About my brother.
- What about your brother?

59:45.164 --> 59:48.568
He didn't die of pneumonia
or consumption. I lied.

59:48.668 --> 59:50.602
He committed suicide.

59:51.754 --> 59:53.230
Oh, my God.

59:54.424 --> 59:57.609
So no wedding. No sons.

59:59.095 --> 01:00:00.946
What's all this for?

01:00:03.308 --> 01:00:06.211
- Did you talk to Hadass?
- What for?

01:00:06.311 --> 01:00:08.421
She loves you, Avigdor.
She'll still marry you.

01:00:08.521 --> 01:00:09.672
Not if her parents say no.

01:00:09.772 --> 01:00:11.674
Yes, she can. If she thinks her
parents are wrong, she can.

01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:13.760
Come on, Anshel. You think
it's so easy. She's a woman.

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:15.553
- What does that have to do...
- She can't think for herself.

01:00:15.653 --> 01:00:17.013
That's nonsense. Not all...

01:00:17.113 --> 01:00:19.265
Please, Anshel, this isn't a time
for a philosophical argument.

01:00:19.365 --> 01:00:22.101
I've lost the one girl that I've
ever loved, that I'll ever love.

01:00:22.201 --> 01:00:24.553
You want to sit here and argue?

01:00:31.544 --> 01:00:33.645
You'll fall in love again.

01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:38.692
No.

01:00:39.927 --> 01:00:44.322
Hadass is a nice girl, but don't
make her into more than she is.

01:00:44.515 --> 01:00:49.202
No, I'm not. She was
exactly what I wanted.

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:02.924
Please don't.

01:01:09.082 --> 01:01:10.515
I'm sorry.

01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:13.393
Is this really happening, Anshel?

01:01:15.922 --> 01:01:20.859
Maybe someone else will turn up for you.

01:01:24.055 --> 01:01:29.836
Maybe not quite as pretty,

01:01:29.936 --> 01:01:32.871
maybe with brown hair.

01:01:35.233 --> 01:01:37.709
I wouldn't notice her if she did.

01:03:06.532 --> 01:03:09.143
Why do you punish him for
something his brother did?

01:03:09.243 --> 01:03:12.772
- Anshel, please.
- Hadass should be proud to be his wife.

01:03:12.872 --> 01:03:14.482
You should be proud
to be his father-in-law.

01:03:14.582 --> 01:03:15.566
Anshel.

01:03:15.666 --> 01:03:17.443
They love each other.
That's all that matters.

01:03:17.543 --> 01:03:19.612
No, that's not all.
There are other things.

01:03:19.712 --> 01:03:25.118
- Don't talk old wives' tales. Talk the law.
- I'll talk more than the law. I'll talk life!

01:03:25.218 --> 01:03:28.079
What matters is a man's children.

01:03:28.179 --> 01:03:31.708
It's his children that your
law exists for, her children.

01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:35.378
That's her only dowry,
and my obligation as her father.

01:03:35.478 --> 01:03:38.830
I have one daughter.
I want the best for her.

01:03:40.942 --> 01:03:42.635
Avigdor is the best.

01:03:42.735 --> 01:03:48.131
The best scholar, maybe the best friend,
but not the best choice.

01:03:48.908 --> 01:03:52.353
We want someone from a good family,

01:03:52.453 --> 01:03:56.514
someone with no secrets to hide.

01:03:57.291 --> 01:03:59.225
Someone like...

01:04:05.591 --> 01:04:07.150
Someone else.

01:04:15.268 --> 01:04:16.576
Anshel.

01:04:18.771 --> 01:04:20.455
A little more?

01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:36.888
In the middle of the night,
he goes to school.

01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:41.726
- What did you have for dinner?
- What did I have for dinner?

01:04:42.628 --> 01:04:46.231
- Very little.
- And Hadass?

01:04:47.383 --> 01:04:51.444
- She's still in love. What do you expect?
- How did she look?

01:04:53.055 --> 01:04:54.990
Not as bad as you do.

01:04:58.311 --> 01:05:01.672
You didn't miss anything.
It was like a madhouse.

01:05:01.772 --> 01:05:06.042
- The whole family's going crazy.
- What do you mean?

01:05:08.029 --> 01:05:09.388
Well, it's just that...

01:05:10.615 --> 01:05:15.394
I'm sure Reb Alter... I mean, to save face,
they're going to try to marry her off...

01:05:15.494 --> 01:05:18.763
After a broken engagement,
they have to. It's usual.

01:05:19.332 --> 01:05:21.975
- Did they mention someone?
- No, no.

01:05:22.793 --> 01:05:25.738
But you should have seen the
way they were looking at me.

01:05:25.838 --> 01:05:26.906
You?

01:05:28.841 --> 01:05:33.663
Can you imagine? It shows
you how desperate they are.

01:05:41.729 --> 01:05:44.664
- What's the matter? What?
- The books.

01:05:45.399 --> 01:05:51.347
Avigdor? What's the matter?
That's a sin. What are you doing?

01:05:51.447 --> 01:05:54.215
Avigdor, please,
just tell me what's happening.

01:05:55.368 --> 01:05:57.478
- The books.
- What?

01:05:57.578 --> 01:05:59.397
- What are you doing?
- Where is it?

01:05:59.497 --> 01:06:02.474
- What are you looking for?
- Here it is.

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:05.852
- What's the matter? Please?
- Sit down. Sit down.

01:06:09.590 --> 01:06:10.815
Avigdor, just...

01:06:11.550 --> 01:06:15.361
Anshel, I'm going to make you
the happiest man in the world.

01:06:16.138 --> 01:06:18.833
- Yes?
- Anshel, it is the law, and it's written.

01:06:18.933 --> 01:06:22.327
- And you like everything written.
- What's written, Avigdor?

01:06:25.356 --> 01:06:27.216
It's the perfect solution.
We are like brothers.

01:06:27.316 --> 01:06:31.211
If one dies, it is the other's
obligation to marry his widow.

01:06:32.196 --> 01:06:35.799
- Who's died? No one's died.
- I want you to marry Hadass.

01:06:37.243 --> 01:06:38.644
- Oh, no.
- Yes.

01:06:38.744 --> 01:06:41.147
Never, Avigdor, I couldn't, never...

01:06:41.247 --> 01:06:43.181
- Why not?
- Why not?

01:06:43.749 --> 01:06:45.484
- She loves you. That's why not.
- Listen. Let me explain.

01:06:45.584 --> 01:06:46.652
Anyway, you're not dead.

01:06:46.752 --> 01:06:48.154
Hadass isn't a widow,
and I'm not your brother.

01:06:48.254 --> 01:06:50.406
- In my eyes, you are.
- In my eyes, you're crazy.

01:06:50.506 --> 01:06:52.366
I don't want to marry her!
I don't want to marry anyone.

01:06:52.466 --> 01:06:54.368
- I don't love her. I can't...
- I know. That's good.

01:06:54.468 --> 01:06:55.953
- Good. What are you talking about?
- Will you listen?

01:06:56.053 --> 01:06:57.038
No, I don't want to listen.

01:06:57.138 --> 01:06:58.372
Don't you see? It's fate.
It's meant to be.

01:06:58.472 --> 01:06:59.999
Nothing's meant to be.
We make what's meant to be.

01:07:00.099 --> 01:07:02.043
Anshel, the thought of her with
another man is driving me crazy.

01:07:02.143 --> 01:07:04.003
- Aren't I another man?
- Yes, but not a total stranger.

01:07:04.103 --> 01:07:06.047
You marrying her would be the
nearest thing to me marrying her.

01:07:06.147 --> 01:07:08.341
- I don't want to discuss it any further.
- Think of her for a moment.

01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:10.843
They may marry her off to someone she
doesn't even know, let alone love.

01:07:10.943 --> 01:07:12.678
- She could never love me.
- So she could never love you.

01:07:12.778 --> 01:07:14.180
She likes you.
She is comfortable with you.

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.514
I could see her. I could visit you both.

01:07:15.614 --> 01:07:18.267
- The three of us could be together...
- Avigdor, you're talking like a madman.

01:07:18.367 --> 01:07:20.269
Don't let them take her away from me.
I'll never see her again.

01:07:20.369 --> 01:07:22.521
- Wait, think of you then.
- I am. I am.

01:07:22.621 --> 01:07:23.940
- She'll take care of you.
- No.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.233
- A wealthy family, a beautiful girl...
- No! No!

01:07:26.333 --> 01:07:28.235
Why do you always have to be different?

01:07:28.335 --> 01:07:30.937
Please, that's enough!
Your room is downstairs.

01:07:31.297 --> 01:07:34.232
What's the matter with you?
Any other man would...

01:07:36.177 --> 01:07:39.654
Anshel, time will go by.

01:07:40.598 --> 01:07:42.824
Tempers cool, things change.

01:07:43.934 --> 01:07:47.162
Who knows? Perhaps even her father.

01:07:48.397 --> 01:07:51.384
Your marriage could be dissolved.
Hadass and I could be...

01:07:51.484 --> 01:07:53.710
She means that much to you?

01:07:56.155 --> 01:07:58.256
Who better will you find?

01:07:59.158 --> 01:08:01.259
Who better will she find?

01:08:01.994 --> 01:08:05.982
- Do it, for all of us.
- I can't. It's impossible.

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:07.974
Nothing's impossible.

01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:12.437
Just think about it.

01:08:13.297 --> 01:08:18.109
I've thought. It's out of the question.
The answer is no.

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:36.127
Another question.
Do you feel anything for me?

01:08:37.863 --> 01:08:40.215
- What?
- Do you?

01:08:42.701 --> 01:08:44.344
Of course I do.

01:08:46.538 --> 01:08:48.305
Then think again.

01:09:35.796 --> 01:09:38.564
More noodles? They're your favorite.

01:09:39.466 --> 01:09:43.528
- How do you know?
- You told me last week at dinner.

01:09:45.096 --> 01:09:48.198
- I don't remember.
- I do.

01:09:53.229 --> 01:09:55.540
It's a little chilly in here.

01:09:57.443 --> 01:09:59.178
I thought it was rather warm myself.

01:09:59.278 --> 01:10:03.182
Yes, it is warm, for this time of year.

01:10:03.282 --> 01:10:07.051
No wonder she suits him

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:11.649
She never disputes him

01:10:11.749 --> 01:10:13.317
Last year, it was also warm.

01:10:13.417 --> 01:10:15.694
The conversation's not too exciting

01:10:15.794 --> 01:10:17.822
But, oh, what a change it must be

01:10:17.922 --> 01:10:20.783
To spend an evening where
there's no conversation

01:10:20.883 --> 01:10:22.368
Must be a relief after me

01:10:22.468 --> 01:10:23.494
I'll get dessert.

01:10:23.594 --> 01:10:26.664
And though there's nothing much
to challenge your mind here

01:10:26.764 --> 01:10:29.782
Who cares when the food's so delicious?

01:10:30.142 --> 01:10:33.953
Not to mention these beautiful dishes

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.331
A matched set

01:10:36.899 --> 01:10:40.084
From France yet

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:45.840
- You look pensive.
- No, I was just thinking.

01:10:47.868 --> 01:10:49.260
About me?

01:10:52.164 --> 01:10:54.390
As a matter of fact, I was.

01:10:55.668 --> 01:10:57.935
Good thoughts, I hope.

01:11:00.756 --> 01:11:03.274
Something smells good. What is it?

01:11:03.884 --> 01:11:06.944
It must be the cinnamon
in the baked apple.

01:11:07.972 --> 01:11:09.822
You bake apples, too?

01:11:10.349 --> 01:11:14.160
No wonder he loves her

01:11:14.687 --> 01:11:18.716
No wonder to me

01:11:18.816 --> 01:11:20.217
- A cushion?
- Why not?

01:11:20.317 --> 01:11:24.096
With ribbons and laces

01:11:24.196 --> 01:11:27.766
In all the right places

01:11:27.866 --> 01:11:29.476
- Milk or lemon?
- Yes, please.

01:11:29.576 --> 01:11:33.272
I must admit it's all very pleasant
and this is a comfortable room

01:11:33.372 --> 01:11:34.356
- Which?
- Which what?

01:11:34.456 --> 01:11:36.775
And if he likes the smell
of lilacs and roses

01:11:36.875 --> 01:11:38.777
Then maybe he likes her perfume

01:11:38.877 --> 01:11:39.820
Lemon or milk?

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:43.073
And though her silky hair
and milky complexion are nice

01:11:43.173 --> 01:11:45.201
Still, they're not that distracting

01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:46.911
- Anshel?
- Milky.

01:11:47.011 --> 01:11:48.621
- What?
- Milk, milk, milk!

01:11:48.721 --> 01:11:52.291
So what accounts for the
way he's been acting?

01:11:52.391 --> 01:11:53.375
Honey?

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:55.785
Her softness

01:11:55.936 --> 01:11:56.921
No honey.

01:11:57.021 --> 01:11:58.964
Her sweetness

01:11:59.064 --> 01:12:00.331
Sugar?

01:12:00.899 --> 01:12:05.804
How could he resist her?

01:12:05.904 --> 01:12:06.847
An almond cookie?

01:12:06.947 --> 01:12:09.892
And why would he try?

01:12:09.992 --> 01:12:11.602
How do you get them all the same size?

01:12:11.702 --> 01:12:15.898
No wonder he wants her

01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:17.024
You notice everything.

01:12:17.124 --> 01:12:18.525
He needs her

01:12:18.625 --> 01:12:21.195
The china. Cookies.

01:12:21.295 --> 01:12:25.866
No wonder

01:12:25.966 --> 01:12:28.025
That's really wonderful.

01:12:29.636 --> 01:12:33.290
So would I

01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:37.461
Where are your parents, Hadass?
Maybe they'd like some tea.

01:12:37.561 --> 01:12:40.714
They're in the study
having tea with a guest.

01:12:40.814 --> 01:12:41.799
This one's from Zamosc.

01:12:41.899 --> 01:12:44.593
Yesterday, there were two
from Tolmachev, even older.

01:12:44.693 --> 01:12:46.178
Well, I really have to be going.

01:12:46.278 --> 01:12:50.516
I may have to leave Bechev if they
don't find someone for me here.

01:12:50.616 --> 01:12:53.769
I'm sure they'll find someone.
I mean, who wouldn't want you?

01:12:53.869 --> 01:12:55.771
- I mean...
- Don't you ever think about marriage?

01:12:55.871 --> 01:12:57.815
No, no, no. I just think
about my studies.

01:12:57.915 --> 01:13:00.975
- I admire that in a man.
- That's very good. Well...

01:13:02.294 --> 01:13:03.978
Good night.

01:13:05.172 --> 01:13:06.355
Good night.

01:13:20.979 --> 01:13:22.997
He's not there, Anshel.

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:28.211
He's gone. He took his things and left.

01:13:32.658 --> 01:13:34.008
Hurry.

01:13:34.993 --> 01:13:40.065
Wagons to Lublin province leaving now.
Wagons to Lublin province leaving now.

01:13:40.165 --> 01:13:41.233
Wagons to Lublin province leaving now.

01:13:41.333 --> 01:13:45.029
- Avigdor, don't leave, please. I was wrong.
- You?

01:13:45.129 --> 01:13:47.281
- Fight for her. She's worth fighting for.
- It's no use.

01:13:47.381 --> 01:13:49.283
- Talk to Vishkower.
- I tried. He won't listen.

01:13:49.383 --> 01:13:51.243
Well, let's go see the rabbi.
Maybe there's a law.

01:13:51.343 --> 01:13:53.412
There are no laws, Anshel, not for this.

01:13:53.512 --> 01:13:55.372
Maybe if you took your nose
out of books once in a while,

01:13:55.472 --> 01:13:59.283
you'd know more about life,
about men and women, about love.

01:14:00.561 --> 01:14:04.205
How could I expect you to understand?
You've never felt it.

01:14:08.694 --> 01:14:12.630
- Last call for Lublin province.
- Avigdor!

01:14:16.743 --> 01:14:19.804
- Oh, my God.
- Can I carry your suitcase, sir?

01:14:25.586 --> 01:14:30.189
Bye, Anshel. I'm sorry about everything.

01:14:30.507 --> 01:14:33.619
Asking what I did was my only way
of staying, and it was wrong.

01:14:33.719 --> 01:14:35.913
- No, it's not wrong.
- I think so.

01:14:36.013 --> 01:14:37.623
It's understandable. You're in love.

01:14:37.723 --> 01:14:40.042
- It was sinful, unnatural.
- Who knows what's natural?

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:42.878
- I was asking the impossible.
- Don't go, Avigdor.

01:14:42.978 --> 01:14:45.788
Everything loaded. Everyone aboard.

01:14:46.607 --> 01:14:47.999
Don't go!

01:14:49.193 --> 01:14:51.002
I'll come with you!

01:15:00.329 --> 01:15:04.849
Wait! Avigdor. Nothing's impossible!

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:10.688
Nothing.

01:15:19.515 --> 01:15:21.792
- It's impossible.
- So, we're wrong?

01:15:21.892 --> 01:15:25.254
What do you think, Zelig? I never had
such a hard time fitting anybody.

01:15:25.354 --> 01:15:26.755
- The shoulders are...
- Never mind the shoulders.

01:15:26.855 --> 01:15:28.715
- Look how tight it is around the chest.
- It fits. It fits.

01:15:28.815 --> 01:15:31.218
- This is the way you cut, Zelig.
- Maybe it's the tape measure.

01:15:31.318 --> 01:15:32.845
- Look, it's all right.
- All right?

01:15:32.945 --> 01:15:35.764
For Alter Vishkower's son-in-law,
we have to do our best work.

01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:39.508
- Well, it's my coat, and I like it this way.
- He likes it this way.

01:15:42.412 --> 01:15:43.355
Look at him.

01:15:43.455 --> 01:15:44.889
Look at me

01:15:46.124 --> 01:15:49.060
I must be absolutely crazy

01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:51.530
How did I ever let it get this far?

01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:53.365
Take off the coat.

01:15:53.465 --> 01:15:56.243
I'm getting deeper into trouble

01:15:56.343 --> 01:15:59.121
Am I a woman or a man?
Am I a devil or a demon?

01:15:59.221 --> 01:16:01.331
- We've got a problem with the pants.
- What's wrong with the pants?

01:16:01.431 --> 01:16:03.542
Compared to the pants, even the
coat looks good. Take them off.

01:16:03.642 --> 01:16:05.002
- Why?
- Why?

01:16:05.102 --> 01:16:07.337
Papa was right

01:16:07.437 --> 01:16:10.716
I ask too many questions
He said a soul can get perplexed

01:16:10.816 --> 01:16:12.342
I can't believe what happens
next Papa was right

01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:15.804
- Having trouble at the crotch.
- What's wrong with the crotch?

01:16:15.904 --> 01:16:18.182
You'll find out when you go
"excuse me" to relieve yourself.

01:16:18.282 --> 01:16:21.393
It seems this little game I play
becomes more risky every day

01:16:21.493 --> 01:16:24.396
- The pants, please.
- All right, I'll take them off.

01:16:24.496 --> 01:16:27.649
- But you'll have to leave the room first.
- He's ashamed in front of his tailor.

01:16:27.749 --> 01:16:30.068
A tailor is like a doctor.
What's to be ashamed?

01:16:30.168 --> 01:16:31.403
What do you think, Zelig?

01:16:33.005 --> 01:16:35.314
Are you crazy?
The wedding's tomorrow night.

01:16:37.301 --> 01:16:38.609
Move!

01:16:39.094 --> 01:16:42.863
Tomorrow night? Tomorrow night?

01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:49.588
Tomorrow night, tomorrow night

01:16:49.688 --> 01:16:55.344
Under the canopy I'll stand
with her tomorrow night

01:16:55.444 --> 01:17:01.475
And place a ring upon her hand
with her all dressed in white

01:17:01.575 --> 01:17:03.477
Tomorrow night

01:17:03.577 --> 01:17:06.271
I don't know how this came about
but I'll be wed without a doubt

01:17:06.371 --> 01:17:08.357
Oh, my God. I got to get out

01:17:08.457 --> 01:17:10.182
What did you say?

01:17:10.584 --> 01:17:14.437
- I've got to get out of my clothes.
- Get back out here.

01:17:15.964 --> 01:17:17.407
Look at this

01:17:17.507 --> 01:17:19.024
Come on, move.

01:17:19.301 --> 01:17:22.153
The way one lie begets another

01:17:22.554 --> 01:17:25.040
Somebody wake me up
and say it's all a dream

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:26.240
Ouch!

01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:27.459
Look at this.

01:17:27.559 --> 01:17:29.785
Look how easily I fool them

01:17:30.145 --> 01:17:33.090
They may have eyes, but they don't see
They never really look at me

01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:34.915
People are blind

01:17:35.317 --> 01:17:38.011
How else would everyone believe me?

01:17:38.111 --> 01:17:41.390
It might be interesting to know
just how much further I can go

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:42.558
Well, are you blind, Zelig?

01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:44.643
Look, the right sleeve
is longer than the left.

01:17:44.743 --> 01:17:47.771
- This will never work.
- We'll make it work.

01:17:47.871 --> 01:17:49.731
Well, at least the hat fits.

01:17:49.831 --> 01:17:54.820
Tomorrow night, tomorrow night

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:57.990
I can't believe what I'll presume to be

01:17:58.090 --> 01:18:00.617
Tomorrow night

01:18:00.717 --> 01:18:03.787
I'm not the bride,
but I'm the groom-to-be

01:18:03.887 --> 01:18:06.623
Tomorrow night

01:18:06.723 --> 01:18:09.459
And that's a monumental trick
I'd better think of something quick

01:18:09.559 --> 01:18:11.211
Oh, my God, I'm feeling sick

01:18:11.311 --> 01:18:14.205
It's just the usual nerves
before the wedding.

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:15.674
I think I'd better rest.

01:18:15.774 --> 01:18:19.052
Rest, rest. You'll need all the
rest you can get. Right, Zelig?

01:18:19.152 --> 01:18:23.890
I could run away I could
leave without a trace

01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:26.018
Go anywhere or anyplace

01:18:26.118 --> 01:18:30.856
Where no one knows my
face as a woman or a man

01:18:30.956 --> 01:18:35.277
I don't know, just so I can run away

01:18:35.377 --> 01:18:38.614
Run away

01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:43.243
I'd be free, I'd be rid of all of this

01:18:43.343 --> 01:18:47.363
But there's someone I would miss

01:18:49.141 --> 01:18:52.451
And being near him is what this

01:18:53.061 --> 01:18:55.579
Is all about

01:18:56.732 --> 01:19:00.584
So running away is out

01:19:01.027 --> 01:19:02.262
Do you think he'll get away with it?

01:19:02.362 --> 01:19:03.889
I think we'll get away with it.

01:19:03.989 --> 01:19:06.016
Papa, dear

01:19:06.116 --> 01:19:09.051
You dreamed of dancing at my wedding

01:19:10.829 --> 01:19:14.765
But something tells me that I'm right
You wouldn't want to dance tonight

01:19:19.337 --> 01:19:22.616
Take off the clothes. All right, all right.
We'll leave the room first.

01:19:22.716 --> 01:19:24.242
Come, Zelig, we have
a lot of work to do.

01:19:24.342 --> 01:19:26.360
All with God's help, amen.

01:19:27.095 --> 01:19:29.289
Isn't this

01:19:29.389 --> 01:19:31.782
A strangely logical solution?

01:19:32.684 --> 01:19:37.079
Things may not be as they appear
but the advantages are clear

01:19:38.857 --> 01:19:40.634
He loves her, she loves him

01:19:40.734 --> 01:19:42.094
He likes me, I like her

01:19:42.194 --> 01:19:44.930
And I've reason to think she likes me

01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:48.100
She keeps him, he keeps her
I keep things as they were

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:50.811
It's a perfect arrangement for three

01:19:50.911 --> 01:19:53.397
Who'd have ever predicted
the moment would come

01:19:53.497 --> 01:19:56.233
When I'd find myself grateful
they've kept women dumb?

01:19:56.333 --> 01:19:59.152
She's an innocent maiden
but then so am I

01:19:59.252 --> 01:20:01.488
That's why it's possible I could get by

01:20:01.588 --> 01:20:04.324
Look, I've seen the impossible
happen before

01:20:04.424 --> 01:20:07.077
Maybe, God willing,
it'll happen once more

01:20:07.177 --> 01:20:09.621
For I feel like a train
on a perilous track

01:20:09.721 --> 01:20:11.540
No way to stop, no way to go back

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:13.375
A snowball that's gathering
speed down a hill

01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:16.994
Going faster and faster and faster until

01:20:17.437 --> 01:20:22.625
Tomorrow night, tomorrow night

01:20:22.943 --> 01:20:26.096
Even if someone would pray for me

01:20:26.196 --> 01:20:28.547
Tomorrow night

01:20:28.907 --> 01:20:31.977
There's not a prayer
that they could say for me

01:20:32.077 --> 01:20:34.178
Tomorrow night

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:38.942
Tomorrow night, tomorrow night
Tomorrow night

01:20:39.042 --> 01:20:45.940
Is now tonight

01:20:50.846 --> 01:20:51.830
Blessings.

01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:54.657
Success.

01:20:58.770 --> 01:21:00.464
Musicians, please.

01:21:00.564 --> 01:21:03.457
The mitzvah dance.
The handkerchief dance.

01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:13.217
- Excuse me.
- Where are you going, Anshel?

01:21:13.368 --> 01:21:15.761
Look, look there. Look at the shoulders.

01:21:18.832 --> 01:21:20.776
You're not leaving, are you?

01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:23.695
I have a wedding present
for you, for both of you.

01:21:23.795 --> 01:21:26.364
- Thank you.
- Nachmonides, the holy letter.

01:21:26.464 --> 01:21:28.857
He wrote it over 500 years ago.

01:21:29.467 --> 01:21:32.120
"Converse with her to
put her mind at ease.

01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:37.282
"Speak words which arouse her
to love, desire and passion,

01:21:38.143 --> 01:21:40.828
"and words of reverence for God."

01:21:43.315 --> 01:21:44.999
Never force her.

01:21:45.775 --> 01:21:47.918
Her mood must be as yours.

01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:52.464
Win her with graciousness
and seductiveness.

01:21:53.533 --> 01:21:57.594
Be patient until her passion is aroused.

01:21:59.122 --> 01:22:00.806
Begin with love.

01:22:01.666 --> 01:22:03.851
And when her mood is ready,

01:22:04.169 --> 01:22:06.937
let her desire be satisfied first.

01:22:08.089 --> 01:22:10.315
Her delight is what matters.

01:22:15.221 --> 01:22:16.905
Come along now.

01:22:18.850 --> 01:22:23.588
- Avigdor, I don't know if I can... Avigdor.
- Anshel.

01:22:23.688 --> 01:22:26.623
- Anshel.
- Your father-in-law's calling you.

01:22:28.735 --> 01:22:31.096
Anshel, I have to talk to you.

01:22:31.196 --> 01:22:32.180
Remember your obligation.

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:33.306
- Yes, Mother.
- Anshel, come, my son.

01:22:33.406 --> 01:22:35.966
As I said, you mustn't be nervous.

01:22:37.202 --> 01:22:39.896
See, Eve was made from Adam's
rib to obey his wishes,

01:22:39.996 --> 01:22:41.972
his demands, and so must you.

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:46.111
- See, there's nothing to be nervous about.
- No, Mother. Yes, Mother.

01:22:46.211 --> 01:22:48.655
We have protected her.
She knows nothing.

01:22:48.755 --> 01:22:49.865
But you're the scholar.

01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:52.617
So I don't have to tell you
to be fruitful and multiply.

01:22:52.717 --> 01:22:54.119
Thank you, sir. I know the law.

01:22:54.219 --> 01:22:58.030
May your wedding night
be as joyful as ours was.

01:22:59.557 --> 01:23:02.826
And, please God, a grandson
nine months from now.

01:23:29.462 --> 01:23:31.980
Esther, it's a wonderful wedding.

01:24:13.631 --> 01:24:15.399
Are you too warm?

01:24:16.301 --> 01:24:17.401
No.

01:24:18.928 --> 01:24:21.206
- Shall I open a window?
- No.

01:24:21.306 --> 01:24:24.867
Unless you want to. You're the man.

01:24:26.352 --> 01:24:27.870
That's true.

01:24:30.857 --> 01:24:32.968
- You don't have to be frightened, Hadass.
- I'm not.

01:24:33.068 --> 01:24:34.543
You're not?

01:24:35.236 --> 01:24:37.722
- Yes, I am.
- Good.

01:24:37.822 --> 01:24:40.549
- What?
- I mean, it's only natural.

01:24:42.535 --> 01:24:46.189
But you don't have to do anything
you don't want to, Hadass. Anything.

01:24:46.289 --> 01:24:49.317
But I do. You're my husband, Anshel.
I have to do whatever you demand.

01:24:49.417 --> 01:24:51.695
- No, that's not so.
- It's not?

01:24:51.795 --> 01:24:53.530
No. According to the Talmud,

01:24:53.630 --> 01:24:56.282
a woman has the right to refuse
her husband. You didn't know that?

01:24:56.382 --> 01:24:59.327
- No. My mother said...
- Too many women don't know the law.

01:24:59.427 --> 01:25:00.829
- So if you want to refuse...
- I didn't say...

01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:03.280
Then, naturally, I respect your wishes.

01:25:04.641 --> 01:25:07.367
You're a very considerate man, Anshel.

01:25:08.186 --> 01:25:11.464
Only because I know you're
thinking of someone else.

01:25:11.564 --> 01:25:14.884
Who? I'm not at all, of anyone.

01:25:14.984 --> 01:25:18.221
- You mustn't be angry with him.
- What?

01:25:18.321 --> 01:25:22.633
Well, any woman would be, wouldn't she?
I mean, who was close to him.

01:25:24.661 --> 01:25:26.803
You're very understanding.

01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:31.818
It's only natural that you wish he
were here instead of me. Don't you?

01:25:31.918 --> 01:25:35.613
- But you're my husband...
- The thing is... The thing is, Hadass,

01:25:35.713 --> 01:25:38.616
because you're still
thinking of Avigdor,

01:25:38.716 --> 01:25:41.703
I can't let you commit
any unnecessary sin.

01:25:41.803 --> 01:25:43.496
- Sin?
- Yes, it's very clearly written

01:25:43.596 --> 01:25:45.123
that a woman cannot
give herself to one man

01:25:45.223 --> 01:25:46.207
while she's still thinking of another.

01:25:46.307 --> 01:25:47.584
- You didn't know that?
- No, I...

01:25:47.684 --> 01:25:49.461
Because it's a terrible sin, believe me.

01:25:49.561 --> 01:25:52.297
So, tonight, we'll do what you want,
which is nothing. I understand.

01:25:52.397 --> 01:25:55.207
- I don't know what I want.
- Well, when you do,

01:25:56.359 --> 01:25:58.252
you must let me know.

01:25:59.612 --> 01:26:02.682
You're... You're very
hard to resist, Hadass,

01:26:02.782 --> 01:26:05.676
but I'm not going to
force myself on you.

01:26:06.578 --> 01:26:09.972
I'll... I'll just have to be patient.

01:26:12.375 --> 01:26:15.018
- Good.
- Good.

01:26:20.925 --> 01:26:22.660
A drop more wine?

01:26:25.263 --> 01:26:29.491
- It's our secret. No one needs to know.
- Our secret.

01:26:31.436 --> 01:26:33.245
And our friendship.

01:26:33.438 --> 01:26:36.290
- A husband and wife can be friends?
- Oh, yes.

01:26:36.774 --> 01:26:39.135
- Only one problem.
- What?

01:26:39.235 --> 01:26:40.845
Help me.

01:26:40.945 --> 01:26:43.014
In the morning, when they
come in, they'll think we've...

01:26:44.211 --> 01:26:46.675
- But we haven't.
- Secret.

01:26:53.166 --> 01:26:55.183
Wait, no, no, just one bed.

01:27:02.592 --> 01:27:04.568
You silly goose.

01:27:23.196 --> 01:27:24.713
You tell me.

01:27:27.992 --> 01:27:29.760
Truce, truce.

01:27:47.428 --> 01:27:48.737
Anshel.

01:27:52.809 --> 01:27:55.952
I think I'm going to like
being married to you.

01:28:01.192 --> 01:28:04.586
- Good night, Hadass.
- Good night.

01:28:30.972 --> 01:28:32.572
Hello, Anshel.

01:28:33.891 --> 01:28:35.909
Morning, Avigdor.

01:28:37.812 --> 01:28:39.913
How are you this morning?

01:28:41.065 --> 01:28:42.165
Fine.

01:28:44.152 --> 01:28:46.711
- Good.
- Hey, Anshel!

01:28:49.323 --> 01:28:50.465
You?

01:28:52.702 --> 01:28:55.262
- How's Hadass?
- Fine.

01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:57.597
How's Peshe?

01:28:59.959 --> 01:29:01.653
The wedding,

01:29:01.753 --> 01:29:03.655
- everyone seemed to have a good time.
- Thank you.

01:29:03.755 --> 01:29:06.115
- Everyone seemed to have a good time.
- Yeah, everyone.

01:29:06.215 --> 01:29:08.326
Everyone stayed late.

01:29:08.426 --> 01:29:10.694
Almost everyone, that is.

01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:13.446
- Hadass enjoyed herself?
- Did Peshe?

01:29:14.474 --> 01:29:16.834
We're talking about Hadass.

01:29:16.934 --> 01:29:18.336
You are. Me, I seem to be talking about

01:29:18.436 --> 01:29:19.629
- Peshe.
- Avigdor!

01:29:19.729 --> 01:29:22.080
- Avigdor!
- I'll be right back.

01:29:27.570 --> 01:29:28.920
Don't I know you?

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:35.728
Was it in Zamosc? I seem
to remember something.

01:29:35.828 --> 01:29:36.938
I've never been to Zamosc.

01:29:37.038 --> 01:29:39.764
Well, somewhere else then. Maybe...

01:29:39.957 --> 01:29:41.600
- Oh...
- Nowhere.

01:29:42.376 --> 01:29:45.145
Perhaps I could interest
you in the sacred book.

01:29:49.092 --> 01:29:51.151
No, thanks. I'm not much of a reader.

01:29:53.221 --> 01:29:55.822
Anyway, we buy our books in Lublin.

01:29:56.474 --> 01:29:58.501
Listen, big city bookstore,

01:29:58.601 --> 01:30:00.670
- you pay big city prices.
- Really?

01:30:00.770 --> 01:30:02.005
- Where's that written?
- Come on.

01:30:02.105 --> 01:30:03.747
Some little village, was it?

01:30:04.732 --> 01:30:07.500
Yanev. Somewhere like that.

01:30:08.903 --> 01:30:10.879
Yeah, I...

01:30:16.077 --> 01:30:19.721
Hadass and I talked,
laughed a little... Laughed a lot.

01:30:20.456 --> 01:30:22.400
And then she went to sleep.

01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:24.485
Anshel, I'm a grown man.
You can tell me the truth.

01:30:24.585 --> 01:30:26.863
Why is it people who want the truth
never believe it when they hear it?

01:30:26.963 --> 01:30:27.989
- What did you do to her?
- Nothing.

01:30:28.089 --> 01:30:30.199
- Come on, tell me. Please.
- What do you think I did to her?

01:30:30.299 --> 01:30:32.702
I don't know. You kissed her,
you caressed her, you held her.

01:30:32.802 --> 01:30:34.328
- All right. All right. That, that.
- What? What?

01:30:34.428 --> 01:30:37.906
I did everything just like you said.
What else do you want to know?

01:30:38.224 --> 01:30:40.168
Did she make sounds? Did she scream?

01:30:40.268 --> 01:30:42.253
She did a little screaming,
and then she went to sleep.

01:30:42.353 --> 01:30:43.995
Went to sleep?

01:30:44.605 --> 01:30:46.841
- Anshel.
- And she talked a little.

01:30:46.941 --> 01:30:49.844
Talked? In her sleep? What did she say?

01:30:49.944 --> 01:30:53.380
- Things like, "Avigdor, I love you."
- "I love you?"

01:30:55.116 --> 01:30:56.383
Go on.

01:30:59.912 --> 01:31:03.306
"I adore you, Avigdor," she said.

01:31:06.586 --> 01:31:08.103
That's the truth?

01:31:09.589 --> 01:31:11.231
Yes, my friend.

01:31:12.425 --> 01:31:14.192
That's the truth.

01:31:27.648 --> 01:31:30.885
The whole pleasure of having a son-in-law
is to go to the bath house with him.

01:31:30.985 --> 01:31:32.512
He has a headache, he has a headache.

01:31:32.612 --> 01:31:35.640
You go to the bath house, you sit,
you talk, you discuss life.

01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:37.725
- That's a son-in-law.
- What can you do?

01:31:37.825 --> 01:31:39.560
This week, he can't come,
he has a headache.

01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:42.230
- Last week, he's studying.
- What can you do?

01:31:42.330 --> 01:31:44.315
You know what is giving him the
headache in the first place?

01:31:44.415 --> 01:31:46.182
- Studying.
- Thank you.

01:31:47.043 --> 01:31:49.946
When I was young, it was the
women who had the headaches.

01:31:50.046 --> 01:31:51.572
What?

01:31:51.672 --> 01:31:53.741
Raspberry tea.

01:31:53.841 --> 01:31:56.151
It's very good for headaches.

01:31:56.761 --> 01:31:58.278
Yes, Mother.

01:32:00.431 --> 01:32:03.616
So is something else.

01:32:04.894 --> 01:32:07.120
That also cures headaches.

01:32:08.314 --> 01:32:09.789
What does?

01:32:11.609 --> 01:32:15.795
It's probably why God says it's a
special blessing on the Sabbath.

01:32:16.322 --> 01:32:17.672
Mother.

01:32:18.574 --> 01:32:21.634
It's nature between man and wife.

01:32:23.496 --> 01:32:25.764
Mother, what are you saying?

01:32:26.707 --> 01:32:28.526
What am I saying?

01:32:28.626 --> 01:32:30.778
That you give him a
glass of raspberry tea.

01:32:30.878 --> 01:32:33.855
Everything I say,
you find hidden meaning.

01:32:35.549 --> 01:32:38.485
Raspberry tea is very
good for headaches.

01:32:39.762 --> 01:32:42.822
- Thank you.
- Am I disturbing you?

01:32:43.432 --> 01:32:44.574
No.

01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:52.040
It's almost sundown, the Sabbath.

01:32:53.150 --> 01:32:54.334
Yes.

01:32:56.112 --> 01:32:59.714
My mother says it's a special
blessing on the Sabbath.

01:33:00.783 --> 01:33:03.343
- Going to synagogue?
- Going to bed.

01:33:06.872 --> 01:33:09.099
- Unless you're tired.
- What?

01:33:12.003 --> 01:33:14.562
Drink your tea. It's getting cold.

01:33:21.262 --> 01:33:24.290
When Avigdor used to call,
I sometimes spilled things.

01:33:24.390 --> 01:33:27.668
- I don't know if you ever noticed.
- No, never.

01:33:27.768 --> 01:33:31.996
It's because he made me tremble inside.

01:33:33.941 --> 01:33:35.875
That's love, Hadass.

01:33:36.777 --> 01:33:39.170
But you don't make me tremble.

01:33:41.949 --> 01:33:43.883
You make me peaceful.

01:33:46.662 --> 01:33:49.857
Well, yes. That's the friendship
I was telling you about.

01:33:49.957 --> 01:33:52.350
- You see, in the Talmud...
- So will you teach me?

01:33:55.087 --> 01:33:56.563
Teach you?

01:33:58.549 --> 01:33:59.899
Please?

01:34:01.886 --> 01:34:03.695
- Talmud?
- Talmud?

01:34:04.764 --> 01:34:07.282
- Talmud.
- Not the Talmud.

01:34:07.391 --> 01:34:09.877
Talmud. Talmud. Why not?
Why not, Hadass?

01:34:09.977 --> 01:34:12.713
It's the least a husband can do
for his wife, the most maybe.

01:34:12.813 --> 01:34:14.298
I could never learn Talmud.

01:34:14.398 --> 01:34:17.218
That's nonsense. If I can do it,
you can do it. Lock the door.

01:34:17.318 --> 01:34:19.303
But isn't it a sin? I thought
women were forbidden...

01:34:19.403 --> 01:34:20.680
Sin, sin, it's not a sin.

01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:23.182
Then why are you closing the
curtains and me locking the door?

01:34:23.282 --> 01:34:26.686
Why? Because I trust God will understand.
I'm not so sure about the neighbors.

01:34:26.786 --> 01:34:27.770
Come, sit.

01:34:28.996 --> 01:34:29.939
What's funny?

01:34:30.039 --> 01:34:33.025
You. I've never seen you so excited.

01:34:33.125 --> 01:34:36.237
Now, pay attention, Hadass.
First there's the Bible,

01:34:36.337 --> 01:34:39.156
- the five books of Moses, which God...
- Wait a minute. I'll be right back.

01:34:39.256 --> 01:34:42.618
- Where are you going?
- Anshel, I have the soup on the stove...

01:34:42.718 --> 01:34:45.111
Let your mother do it, please.

01:34:45.679 --> 01:34:48.958
The Talmud, on the other hand, is a series
of commentaries interpreting the...

01:34:49.058 --> 01:34:52.169
- What are you doing?
- I was just pulling a thread...

01:34:52.269 --> 01:34:53.921
- Well, don't. We're studying.
- Yes, Anshel.

01:34:54.021 --> 01:34:55.089
Now, where was I?

01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:57.707
A series of commentaries
interpreting the Bible.

01:34:58.943 --> 01:35:00.126
Yes.

01:35:00.861 --> 01:35:04.473
The first of these commentaries is
called the Mishnah, our code of law.

01:35:04.573 --> 01:35:06.758
I'm glad your headache's better.

01:35:08.786 --> 01:35:10.229
What is so incredible, Hadass,

01:35:10.329 --> 01:35:13.223
is that it's a masterpiece of literature,
folklore and philosophy.

01:35:13.457 --> 01:35:15.901
It deals with astronomy,
architecture, medicine,

01:35:16.001 --> 01:35:19.071
everything from making love
to planting Egyptian beans.

01:35:19.171 --> 01:35:20.647
Making love?

01:35:21.924 --> 01:35:24.618
To planting Egyptian beans.

01:35:24.718 --> 01:35:27.079
I thought you said something
about making love.

01:35:27.179 --> 01:35:31.542
Then there's the Midrash, legends,
stories dealing with legal issues.

01:35:31.642 --> 01:35:32.960
For example, two men are disputing

01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:35.087
the ownership of a mule
or a flock of chickens,

01:35:35.187 --> 01:35:36.255
let's say a flock of chickens...

01:35:36.355 --> 01:35:38.841
Anshel, while your books
argue about chickens,

01:35:38.941 --> 01:35:41.167
I've had to pluck them.

01:35:41.402 --> 01:35:44.305
It's Friday. I've been up since dawn.

01:35:44.405 --> 01:35:48.758
I'm too tired to be a
scholar on Fridays, Anshel.

01:35:49.577 --> 01:35:51.010
I'm sorry.

01:35:52.746 --> 01:35:55.223
I'm the one who's sorry, Hadass.

01:35:56.083 --> 01:35:59.978
I'm too tired for the
special Sabbath blessing,

01:36:00.754 --> 01:36:05.149
even if maybe you were
going to demand it.

01:36:05.801 --> 01:36:07.110
Maybe.

01:36:24.403 --> 01:36:26.379
Next Tuesday, 8:00.

01:36:28.115 --> 01:36:29.517
What about her parents?

01:36:29.617 --> 01:36:33.187
What about her parents? I'll just tell them,
"Avigdor's coming to dinner." That's that.

01:36:33.287 --> 01:36:35.856
Anyway, they're away next Tuesday.

01:36:35.956 --> 01:36:38.359
Are you two agreeing or disagreeing?

01:36:38.459 --> 01:36:39.652
- Agreeing.
- Disagreeing.

01:36:39.752 --> 01:36:41.060
- Disagreeing.
- Agreeing.

01:36:43.797 --> 01:36:46.357
He's one second late.

01:36:47.968 --> 01:36:49.068
Oh.

01:36:49.303 --> 01:36:50.486
Yes.

01:36:53.557 --> 01:36:57.086
- I read a beautiful story today.
- Really?

01:36:57.186 --> 01:36:58.712
David and Jonathan.

01:36:58.812 --> 01:37:01.289
Yes, it's a nice story.

01:37:01.815 --> 01:37:05.344
Their love was even stronger
than a man and a woman's.

01:37:05.444 --> 01:37:08.222
I thought you were
reading the Book of Job.

01:37:08.322 --> 01:37:10.423
I finished it yesterday.

01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:12.685
That's wonderful, Hadass.

01:37:15.287 --> 01:37:18.890
Who do you love more? Me or Avigdor?

01:37:25.464 --> 01:37:28.066
- Hello, Sophie.
- I'll take your hat.

01:37:34.306 --> 01:37:36.074
Thank you, Sophie.

01:37:37.268 --> 01:37:38.618
Hello.

01:37:46.235 --> 01:37:47.845
Well, this is the one I
was telling you about,

01:37:47.945 --> 01:37:49.921
the one I brought from home.

01:37:50.573 --> 01:37:55.760
The first part's about the ancient mystics.
It's all a bit elementary, but...

01:38:00.291 --> 01:38:02.016
Welcome, Avigdor.

01:38:04.878 --> 01:38:07.364
- Tell me more.
- I've told you everything.

01:38:07.464 --> 01:38:09.941
It was a very interesting discussion.

01:38:10.634 --> 01:38:12.610
And then what happened?

01:38:13.846 --> 01:38:17.198
Well, Avigdor was there, too.
He'll tell you.

01:38:18.183 --> 01:38:20.993
And was Rabbi Zalman
angry or did he laugh?

01:38:21.562 --> 01:38:24.330
He laughed. Didn't he, Avigdor?

01:38:25.024 --> 01:38:26.916
- Yes.
- Did you laugh?

01:38:28.402 --> 01:38:29.919
We both did.

01:38:30.529 --> 01:38:32.338
I can just see you.

01:38:41.624 --> 01:38:43.725
- I'll do that.
- No. That's all right.

01:38:44.418 --> 01:38:47.645
- But you have a guest.
- So have you.

01:38:58.807 --> 01:39:00.908
Marriage agrees with you.

01:39:01.852 --> 01:39:04.871
- You're more beautiful than ever.
- Thank you.

01:39:05.939 --> 01:39:08.583
Avigdor, I'm concerned about Anshel.

01:39:09.735 --> 01:39:13.588
- What are you talking about?
- Do you think Anshel is happy?

01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:20.636
Why don't we have tea in the parlor?

01:39:24.249 --> 01:39:27.185
Milk or lemon?

01:39:28.379 --> 01:39:29.562
Fine.

01:39:37.388 --> 01:39:38.654
Sorry.

01:39:46.021 --> 01:39:50.082
We left off with Maimonides'
code of the golden rule.

01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:57.683
Let's read chapters seven and eight,
and then we can discuss them.

01:39:57.783 --> 01:40:00.676
- Is that all right?
- All right.

01:40:03.789 --> 01:40:06.349
Don't stop, Hadass. It's pretty.

01:40:21.140 --> 01:40:23.667
Look at how he looks at her

01:40:23.767 --> 01:40:30.081
Will someone ever look at me that way?

01:40:33.444 --> 01:40:35.512
Full of all the feelings

01:40:35.612 --> 01:40:41.759
And the soft unspoken
words that lovers say

01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:48.525
I thought that I knew every single look

01:40:48.625 --> 01:40:52.279
And sweet expression on his face

01:40:52.379 --> 01:40:56.607
Yet this is one that I don't recognize

01:40:57.134 --> 01:41:02.446
Although I've sat and
studied him for hours

01:41:03.015 --> 01:41:08.870
But now I see how love
completely occupies

01:41:09.354 --> 01:41:12.081
A pair of eyes

01:41:13.108 --> 01:41:15.761
See the way they gaze at her

01:41:15.861 --> 01:41:22.300
Like slaves they follow
everywhere she goes

01:41:25.037 --> 01:41:27.690
Do my eyes forget themselves

01:41:27.790 --> 01:41:30.567
And do I ever look at him

01:41:30.667 --> 01:41:33.070
And smile in such a way

01:41:33.170 --> 01:41:36.990
That what I'm feeling shows?

01:41:37.090 --> 01:41:39.702
Sometimes I have the feeling

01:41:39.802 --> 01:41:43.372
Everybody knows

01:41:43.472 --> 01:41:46.291
And even though it's crazy

01:41:46.391 --> 01:41:53.331
Still I can't help wondering if
I'll ever live to see that day

01:41:54.399 --> 01:41:58.887
When by some

01:41:58.987 --> 01:42:01.974
Miracle of miracles

01:42:02.074 --> 01:42:08.846
He'll turn around and look at me

01:42:10.082 --> 01:42:14.528
That way

01:42:14.628 --> 01:42:18.657
It's no good. I'm sorry. Excuse me.

01:42:18.757 --> 01:42:21.525
Avigdor. Avigdor, wait!

01:42:22.553 --> 01:42:24.195
Good night.

01:42:33.856 --> 01:42:35.164
Anshel.

01:42:37.943 --> 01:42:40.252
How many children do you want?

01:42:43.365 --> 01:42:48.604
The actual number?
I don't think I've ever really...

01:42:48.704 --> 01:42:51.973
He didn't make me tremble tonight.

01:42:53.876 --> 01:42:55.559
You did, though.

01:42:57.337 --> 01:43:01.732
- What's even nicer, I made you tremble.
- What?

01:43:02.968 --> 01:43:06.038
When he was leaving,
I put my hand on yours.

01:43:06.138 --> 01:43:07.989
You were trembling.

01:43:08.557 --> 01:43:11.617
Well, what are you doing, Hadass?

01:43:12.102 --> 01:43:15.130
- I want to look at you.
- Well, I can't read without my glasses.

01:43:15.230 --> 01:43:18.342
When you told me I had
the right to refuse you,

01:43:18.442 --> 01:43:22.179
you didn't tell me I also had
the right to demand you.

01:43:22.279 --> 01:43:23.764
Who told you that?

01:43:23.864 --> 01:43:27.976
The Talmud, the Yebamoth Tractate,
I forget what page.

01:43:28.076 --> 01:43:29.186
Sixty-three A and B.

01:43:29.286 --> 01:43:33.565
- It's written, Anshel.
- You've been studying too hard.

01:43:33.665 --> 01:43:36.851
You told me to tell you
when I knew what I wanted.

01:43:37.711 --> 01:43:38.936
I do.

01:43:39.588 --> 01:43:42.241
And it isn't Avigdor,
so it's no longer a sin.

01:43:42.341 --> 01:43:44.191
Hadass, I...

01:43:45.344 --> 01:43:49.739
It's been terrible for you,
I know, all this waiting.

01:43:51.391 --> 01:43:53.409
But it's all right now.

01:43:53.894 --> 01:43:56.454
You don't have to wait any longer.

01:43:57.731 --> 01:44:01.584
Oh, God. Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

01:44:02.361 --> 01:44:04.837
- I'm so sorry, Hadass.
- For what?

01:44:05.572 --> 01:44:08.758
For teaching me? For understanding me?

01:44:09.326 --> 01:44:11.353
For making me fall in love with you?

01:44:11.453 --> 01:44:14.847
No. I can't. I can't.

01:44:16.583 --> 01:44:19.185
I feel so certain that you love me.

01:44:20.379 --> 01:44:23.105
Everything you do shows me you love me.

01:44:24.216 --> 01:44:25.909
What is it, Anshel?

01:44:26.009 --> 01:44:28.652
Look at how she looks at me

01:44:29.805 --> 01:44:35.127
I can never look at her that way

01:44:35.227 --> 01:44:38.079
Is it me? Am I so...

01:44:38.814 --> 01:44:42.291
- Do you find me...
- I find you beautiful, Hadass, beautiful.

01:44:43.735 --> 01:44:45.169
Then what?

01:44:46.029 --> 01:44:47.723
Full of all the feelings

01:44:47.823 --> 01:44:53.520
And the soft unspoken
words that lovers say

01:44:53.620 --> 01:44:56.481
There are so many things I
wish I could explain to you,

01:44:56.581 --> 01:44:58.849
things I'd like to tell you.

01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:01.477
I feel so...

01:45:02.295 --> 01:45:05.523
- Maybe you'll feel better tomorrow?
- I hope so.

01:45:06.133 --> 01:45:11.079
In all the words in all the books
I wish there were a way to say

01:45:11.179 --> 01:45:15.834
What she's taught me
isn't written anywhere

01:45:15.934 --> 01:45:20.913
And I'm supposed to
be the one who's wise

01:45:21.732 --> 01:45:23.342
One thing is certain

01:45:23.442 --> 01:45:26.961
I can never be what she

01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:31.465
Expects of me

01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:46.480
I've wanted the shadows

01:45:47.174 --> 01:45:50.734
I don't anymore

01:45:51.887 --> 01:45:55.614
No matter what happens

01:45:56.266 --> 01:46:00.452
I won't anymore

01:46:00.979 --> 01:46:04.800
I've run from the sunlight

01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:07.918
Afraid it saw too much

01:46:08.195 --> 01:46:12.256
The moon had the one light

01:46:12.657 --> 01:46:15.050
I bathed in

01:46:15.285 --> 01:46:17.521
I walked in

01:46:17.621 --> 01:46:23.267
I held in my feelings

01:46:23.710 --> 01:46:26.896
And closed every door

01:46:27.881 --> 01:46:31.410
No matter what happens

01:46:31.510 --> 01:46:35.872
I can't anymore

01:46:35.972 --> 01:46:39.960
There's someone who must hear

01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:44.131
The words I've never spoken

01:46:44.231 --> 01:46:47.926
Tonight if he were here

01:46:48.026 --> 01:46:52.389
My silence would be broken

01:46:52.489 --> 01:46:56.309
I need him to touch me

01:46:56.409 --> 01:46:59.354
To know the love that's in my heart

01:46:59.454 --> 01:47:03.483
The same heart that tells me

01:47:03.583 --> 01:47:05.736
To see myself

01:47:05.836 --> 01:47:07.988
To free myself

01:47:08.088 --> 01:47:13.702
To be myself at last

01:47:13.802 --> 01:47:18.489
For too many mornings

01:47:18.807 --> 01:47:22.409
The curtains were drawn

01:47:22.686 --> 01:47:26.163
It's time they were opened

01:47:26.356 --> 01:47:29.760
To welcome the dawn

01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:33.930
A voice deep inside's getting stronger

01:47:34.030 --> 01:47:38.810
I can't keep it quiet any longer

01:47:38.910 --> 01:47:43.389
No matter what happens

01:47:43.832 --> 01:47:50.521
It can't be the same anymore

01:48:01.850 --> 01:48:03.951
I promise

01:48:04.936 --> 01:48:07.579
It won't be

01:48:08.565 --> 01:48:11.875
The same

01:48:13.153 --> 01:48:19.049
Anymore

01:48:44.809 --> 01:48:46.419
I'll miss you.

01:48:46.519 --> 01:48:49.172
Oh, you'll have lots
to do while I'm gone.

01:48:49.272 --> 01:48:52.175
- I know, but...
- Tell your parents I'm sorry.

01:48:52.275 --> 01:48:53.718
Sorry?

01:48:53.818 --> 01:48:56.263
That I wasn't here when they got home.

01:48:56.363 --> 01:49:01.059
You'll see them on Friday.
You can tell us all about the big city.

01:49:01.159 --> 01:49:03.552
Show them the books you bought.

01:49:07.499 --> 01:49:09.433
I baked almond cakes.

01:49:10.085 --> 01:49:13.697
You and Avigdor wouldn't last three
days without my almond cakes.

01:49:13.797 --> 01:49:15.272
Thank you.

01:49:19.552 --> 01:49:21.028
Hurry home.

01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:24.406
It won't be the same here without you.

01:49:24.683 --> 01:49:25.949
Hadass.

01:49:27.018 --> 01:49:29.629
Do you remember what
we studied last week

01:49:29.729 --> 01:49:32.039
in the Talmud about patience?

01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:34.718
Tell me, what did we read?

01:49:34.818 --> 01:49:37.721
- "Patience yields many good things."
- That's right.

01:49:37.821 --> 01:49:41.099
And if you have patience,
you'll have everything you want.

01:49:41.199 --> 01:49:44.510
Children, beautiful children,
as many as you want.

01:49:45.578 --> 01:49:46.970
Trust me.

01:49:48.665 --> 01:49:50.307
I do trust you.

01:49:55.505 --> 01:49:58.899
Well, I have to be going.

01:50:05.557 --> 01:50:10.786
I'll study while you're away.
I want you to be proud of me.

01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:13.956
Oh, I am proud of you.

01:50:14.733 --> 01:50:17.167
You should be proud of yourself.

01:50:19.487 --> 01:50:21.338
I love you, Anshel.

01:50:24.326 --> 01:50:25.968
I love you, too.

01:50:36.212 --> 01:50:38.021
She's mother

01:50:39.007 --> 01:50:40.691
She's sister

01:50:41.426 --> 01:50:43.944
She's lover

01:50:44.804 --> 01:50:50.752
She's the wonder of wonders

01:50:50.852 --> 01:50:55.372
No man can deny

01:50:55.732 --> 01:51:00.502
So why would he change her?

01:51:00.945 --> 01:51:05.007
She's loving, she's tender

01:51:05.408 --> 01:51:09.761
She's woman

01:51:12.290 --> 01:51:18.687
So am I

01:51:26.096 --> 01:51:28.081
This trip was a good
idea of yours, Anshel.

01:51:28.181 --> 01:51:31.042
- I have a secret to tell you.
- Tell me.

01:51:31.142 --> 01:51:33.911
- Not now.
- All right.

01:51:35.313 --> 01:51:39.009
So my crazy plan was crazy after all.

01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:40.677
What?

01:51:40.777 --> 01:51:42.554
She loves you now.

01:51:42.654 --> 01:51:45.714
- She only thinks she does.
- What?

01:51:46.908 --> 01:51:49.728
Things aren't always what they seem.

01:51:49.828 --> 01:51:52.105
What are you talking about?

01:51:52.205 --> 01:51:53.680
You'll see.

01:51:56.501 --> 01:51:59.228
Now, what's this secret of yours?

01:52:01.339 --> 01:52:04.024
I'll tell you when we get to Lublin.

01:52:07.429 --> 01:52:12.157
- Look, there's our friend again.
- I wonder if it ever gets tired.

01:52:26.823 --> 01:52:30.018
- So, when are you going to tell me?
- Not yet.

01:52:30.118 --> 01:52:32.135
- Why not?
- I just can't.

01:53:39.687 --> 01:53:41.121
Slivovitz?

01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:43.415
No, thanks.

01:53:44.776 --> 01:53:47.336
So, let's hear this secret of yours.

01:53:50.114 --> 01:53:55.010
- Maybe I will have a glass.
- Good. You look a little pale.

01:54:10.134 --> 01:54:11.610
So, tell me.

01:54:17.308 --> 01:54:18.742
Well...

01:54:21.479 --> 01:54:24.206
We're friends. What can't you tell me?

01:54:27.443 --> 01:54:28.877
All right.

01:54:31.906 --> 01:54:34.893
Avigdor, what would you do

01:54:34.993 --> 01:54:39.063
if all you ever wanted in life was
to study, and it was forbidden?

01:54:39.163 --> 01:54:41.691
- It isn't forbidden. It isn't.
- But if it were?

01:54:41.791 --> 01:54:46.446
What if there was some crazy law
that said all men called Avigdor

01:54:46.546 --> 01:54:49.574
or all men with brown eyes were
forbidden to study? What would you do?

01:54:49.674 --> 01:54:51.409
- I'd study anyway.
- Secretly?

01:54:51.509 --> 01:54:53.244
If I had to. Why?

01:54:53.344 --> 01:54:56.456
That would be difficult, wouldn't it?
Always hiding, afraid of being discovered.

01:54:56.556 --> 01:54:59.083
Yes. What's your secret?

01:54:59.183 --> 01:55:02.253
Without Talmud, without studying,
you couldn't live. Is that right?

01:55:02.353 --> 01:55:05.173
- That's right. But you don't...
- I couldn't live without it, either.

01:55:05.273 --> 01:55:09.886
- So?
- So I studied, secretly.

01:55:09.986 --> 01:55:13.672
No, you didn't. What are you
babbling about, Anshel?

01:55:16.034 --> 01:55:20.637
Avigdor, my name isn't Anshel.

01:55:22.081 --> 01:55:23.932
That's your secret?

01:55:26.544 --> 01:55:28.145
Dear Avigdor.

01:55:29.839 --> 01:55:33.826
- I don't know how I'm gonna tell you this.
- Well, don't. I'll guess. Let's see.

01:55:33.926 --> 01:55:35.119
I'm not a yeshiva boy.

01:55:35.219 --> 01:55:38.414
That's it. You're the chief rabbi
of Lithuania. Am I warm?

01:55:38.514 --> 01:55:43.452
- I'm not any kind of boy.
- Not the chief rabbi, all right. All right.

01:55:44.395 --> 01:55:46.288
My name isn't Anshel.

01:55:47.607 --> 01:55:50.667
- It's Yentl.
- Yentl?

01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:53.587
And...

01:55:57.909 --> 01:55:59.426
I'm a woman.

01:56:00.995 --> 01:56:02.679
A woman?

01:56:04.165 --> 01:56:05.640
A woman.

01:56:06.834 --> 01:56:08.685
Now, my secret.

01:56:09.921 --> 01:56:12.824
- I'm the czar of Russia.
- If you don't believe me, I'll prove it.

01:56:12.924 --> 01:56:17.611
- Stop this, Anshel.
- I'm not Anshel. I'm Yentl.

01:56:19.222 --> 01:56:23.126
I'm not a man. I'm a woman.

01:56:23.226 --> 01:56:24.752
Stop it.

01:56:24.852 --> 01:56:28.506
- I'm a woman, Avigdor.
- Anshel, I don't like this.

01:56:28.606 --> 01:56:30.925
What kind of a game is this?

01:56:31.025 --> 01:56:35.545
It's not a game. Not anymore.

01:56:39.534 --> 01:56:41.384
What are you doing?

01:56:46.708 --> 01:56:48.558
What are you doing?

01:56:59.762 --> 01:57:01.238
Oh, my God.

01:57:03.099 --> 01:57:06.210
I've only shown you, so you
can testify to the rabbis.

01:57:06.310 --> 01:57:09.371
- It can't be.
- It is.

01:57:11.816 --> 01:57:13.708
What have you done?

01:57:15.111 --> 01:57:16.721
- Avigdor, listen to me.
- Don't come near me.

01:57:16.821 --> 01:57:19.891
- Please, just let me explain.
- Don't touch me.

01:57:19.991 --> 01:57:22.352
Avigdor, don't be afraid of me.
I'm not going to hurt you.

01:57:22.452 --> 01:57:24.854
- Look at you. You're a monster.
- No. No, I'm not.

01:57:24.954 --> 01:57:27.398
- Sins, sins, sins upon sins.
- All I ever wanted to do in life was study,

01:57:27.498 --> 01:57:28.441
and they wouldn't let me.

01:57:28.541 --> 01:57:30.568
"A woman shall not wear that
which pertaineth to a man."

01:57:30.668 --> 01:57:31.653
Avigdor, please, I had no choice!

01:57:31.753 --> 01:57:33.196
- You're a devil.
- Just try to understand...

01:57:33.296 --> 01:57:36.199
- Enough! Please!
- I'm not... I'm not... No, I'm not a devil.

01:57:36.299 --> 01:57:38.701
Every commandment broken,
every second, every day, every night.

01:57:38.801 --> 01:57:41.152
Stay away from me! Please!

01:57:41.888 --> 01:57:44.248
- What are you, a demon?
- I'm not. You know...

01:57:44.348 --> 01:57:46.584
- You spit on the Torah!
- I love the Torah!

01:57:46.684 --> 01:57:50.630
You spit on it! You spit on everything
and everyone and nature itself!

01:57:50.730 --> 01:57:55.343
In God's face, in my face,
in Hadass' face! God, Hadass.

01:57:55.443 --> 01:57:57.553
- She knows nothing.
- "She knows nothing." Nothing?

01:57:57.653 --> 01:57:58.763
No, she's never...

01:57:58.863 --> 01:58:02.100
An innocent married to a devil!
You married a woman!

01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:03.976
- How could you do such a thing?
- It was your idea!

01:58:04.076 --> 01:58:06.437
- Mine? This? My doing?
- Yes.

01:58:06.537 --> 01:58:08.856
Why? Come on, you're a man.
Come on. Why?

01:58:08.956 --> 01:58:10.191
You're a man. Answer me like a man.

01:58:10.291 --> 01:58:12.485
- I want to know why. Why? Why? Why?
- You wanted me to!

01:58:12.585 --> 01:58:14.153
Why didn't you tell me you were a woman?

01:58:14.253 --> 01:58:15.530
- I was afraid!
- Of what?

01:58:15.630 --> 01:58:17.073
Of this, of exactly this!

01:58:17.173 --> 01:58:19.784
So you lied to me! You lied to Hadass!

01:58:19.884 --> 01:58:22.495
God, the things I told you,
things I wouldn't even tell a wife!

01:58:22.595 --> 01:58:23.621
I'm glad you told me.

01:58:23.721 --> 01:58:25.790
- What kind of a creature are you?
- Just a woman.

01:58:25.890 --> 01:58:27.458
That's not good enough.
I want the answer.

01:58:27.558 --> 01:58:30.294
Tell me the answer. Why? Why?

01:58:30.394 --> 01:58:32.964
- Why? Why?
- I was afraid!

01:58:33.064 --> 01:58:35.216
- I wanted to be near you!
- Why?

01:58:35.316 --> 01:58:36.718
- I didn't want to lose you!
- Why?

01:58:36.818 --> 01:58:38.668
I loved you.

01:58:43.783 --> 01:58:45.133
I loved you.

01:58:48.162 --> 01:58:49.930
Oh, God.

01:58:50.832 --> 01:58:53.526
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

01:58:53.626 --> 01:58:55.602
I loved you.

01:59:07.557 --> 01:59:10.492
I thought you didn't
understand about love.

01:59:13.187 --> 01:59:14.621
No wonder.

01:59:16.107 --> 01:59:17.874
My God, no wonder.

01:59:20.111 --> 01:59:22.180
All the times I looked at you,
and I touched you,

01:59:22.280 --> 01:59:24.307
and I couldn't understand why.

01:59:24.407 --> 01:59:26.684
I thought there was
something wrong with me.

01:59:26.784 --> 01:59:30.303
There was nothing wrong with you.
It was me.

01:59:42.967 --> 01:59:44.401
Your skin.

01:59:45.803 --> 01:59:47.237
It's so...

01:59:49.974 --> 01:59:51.449
Your hair.

01:59:52.643 --> 01:59:54.670
It must have been beautiful.

01:59:54.770 --> 01:59:56.246
It'll grow.

01:59:58.065 --> 01:59:59.624
Your hands.

02:00:00.735 --> 02:00:02.637
I always tried to hide them.

02:00:02.737 --> 02:00:04.045
Oh, no.

02:00:10.119 --> 02:00:11.761
I did... I...

02:00:15.666 --> 02:00:17.851
I didn't want to touch you.

02:00:20.963 --> 02:00:22.647
I was afraid to.

02:00:30.348 --> 02:00:31.948
Your mouth.

02:00:38.689 --> 02:00:39.956
Yentl.

02:00:43.110 --> 02:00:44.836
I loved you, too.

02:01:12.223 --> 02:01:13.531
Hadass.

02:01:24.944 --> 02:01:29.422
It's not difficult.

02:01:31.575 --> 02:01:33.519
I'll write a statement to the rabbis

02:01:33.619 --> 02:01:37.315
that the marriage was never consummated.

02:01:37.415 --> 02:01:42.403
And you can take it back to
Bechev and give it to the rabbis.

02:01:42.503 --> 02:01:44.363
The rabbis witnessed it.

02:01:44.463 --> 02:01:49.160
Witnessed what, a marriage
between two women? It's null and void.

02:01:49.260 --> 02:01:51.537
Nevertheless,
according to divorce procedures...

02:01:51.637 --> 02:01:56.542
No, you're wrong, Avigdor.
According to God, it was not a marriage.

02:01:56.642 --> 02:01:59.828
This is crazy. I'm arguing
Talmud with a woman.

02:02:05.651 --> 02:02:07.710
It's not the first time.

02:02:19.415 --> 02:02:21.474
Go back to her, Avigdor.

02:02:24.754 --> 02:02:28.398
I don't think Hadass will
listen to her parents anymore.

02:02:29.216 --> 02:02:30.785
Maybe there's something else we can do.

02:02:30.885 --> 02:02:33.746
There must be a law or something,
a tractate...

02:02:33.846 --> 02:02:36.739
Avigdor, there's no
book with this in it.

02:02:38.059 --> 02:02:41.119
Sometimes right can come from wrong,

02:02:43.397 --> 02:02:45.132
virtue from sin.

02:02:45.232 --> 02:02:47.542
It's in the Talmud somewhere.

02:02:49.111 --> 02:02:51.097
We'll go to another town
where no one knows us.

02:02:51.197 --> 02:02:53.766
We'll get married. We'll make a home.
We'll have children.

02:02:53.866 --> 02:02:57.802
- We'll... I'll find a new yeshiva.
- For both of us?

02:02:58.871 --> 02:03:00.930
You still want to study?

02:03:02.083 --> 02:03:04.360
Avigdor, we've argued the Bible

02:03:04.460 --> 02:03:06.445
straight back to Genesis,
chapter one, verse one.

02:03:06.545 --> 02:03:10.815
- How could you still ask me that question?
- You don't need to anymore.

02:03:12.009 --> 02:03:13.786
I'll do the thinking.
I'll take care of everything.

02:03:13.886 --> 02:03:16.747
No, I want to study with you,
not darn your socks!

02:03:16.847 --> 02:03:19.625
- You're asking the impossible.
- Nothing's impossible!

02:03:19.725 --> 02:03:22.753
All right. All right. You can study at night
when I come home. No one has to know.

02:03:22.853 --> 02:03:25.464
What are we gonna do,
draw the curtains, close the shutters?

02:03:25.564 --> 02:03:27.800
Don't you understand?
I want you to be a real woman.

02:03:27.900 --> 02:03:31.262
- I am a real woman.
- Then act like one!

02:03:31.362 --> 02:03:35.224
There's no gift from God that is
more beautiful and more miraculous.

02:03:35.324 --> 02:03:38.102
You know everything without
opening a single book.

02:03:38.202 --> 02:03:40.178
What more do you want?

02:03:44.583 --> 02:03:45.808
More.

02:04:22.788 --> 02:04:24.264
Your beard.

02:04:25.958 --> 02:04:28.518
I suppose it'll never grow in now.

02:04:33.340 --> 02:04:35.733
How could I have been so blind?

02:04:38.721 --> 02:04:42.365
Here's a statement for the
rabbi and a note for Hadass.

02:04:43.893 --> 02:04:46.703
Would you give it to her for me, please?

02:04:47.479 --> 02:04:49.080
I will miss you.

02:04:50.441 --> 02:04:52.667
I'll miss you, too, Avigdor.

02:05:16.967 --> 02:05:18.693
Goodbye, Anshel.

02:05:20.387 --> 02:05:21.654
Yentl.

02:05:26.560 --> 02:05:27.827
Yentl.

02:05:38.697 --> 02:05:45.261
There are moments
you remember all your life

02:05:46.163 --> 02:05:53.102
There are moments you know
will be with you all your life

02:05:54.797 --> 02:06:01.861
His face will be written on my mind

02:06:04.181 --> 02:06:10.995
Will be written in my heart

02:06:12.189 --> 02:06:19.212
As long as I live

02:06:20.489 --> 02:06:22.340
My dear Avigdor.

02:06:22.866 --> 02:06:26.353
After many months,
your letter finally reached me.

02:06:26.453 --> 02:06:28.596
I hope this one finds you.

02:06:29.331 --> 02:06:34.445
Since we said goodbye, I've prayed
that despite all the pain I've caused,

02:06:34.545 --> 02:06:37.188
some happiness would come out of it.

02:06:38.090 --> 02:06:40.451
And now you tell me it has.

02:06:40.551 --> 02:06:45.822
As for me, I'm going to a new place
where I hear things are different.

02:06:46.724 --> 02:06:49.126
Anyway, we'll see.

02:06:49.226 --> 02:06:52.004
Take care of yourself and Hadass.

02:06:52.104 --> 02:06:54.924
I hope she continues with her studies.

02:06:55.024 --> 02:06:57.343
She has great promise.

02:06:57.443 --> 02:07:01.337
And remember, I will
love you both, always.

02:07:03.407 --> 02:07:09.512
Tell me where

02:07:11.081 --> 02:07:16.519
Where is it written what
it is I'm meant to be?

02:07:25.721 --> 02:07:29.157
That I can't dare?

02:07:35.773 --> 02:07:39.667
It all began

02:07:41.362 --> 02:07:44.255
The day I found

02:07:45.449 --> 02:07:52.472
That from my window I could
only see a piece of sky

02:07:52.956 --> 02:08:00.021
I stepped outside and looked around

02:08:00.798 --> 02:08:05.536
I never dreamed it was so wide

02:08:05.636 --> 02:08:08.664
Or even half as high

02:08:08.764 --> 02:08:13.210
The time had come
Papa, can you hear me?

02:08:13.310 --> 02:08:17.339
To try my wings
Papa, are you near me?

02:08:17.439 --> 02:08:24.221
And even though it seemed
at any moment I could fall

02:08:24.321 --> 02:08:28.767
I felt the most
Papa, can you see me?

02:08:28.867 --> 02:08:32.604
Amazing things
Can you understand me?

02:08:32.704 --> 02:08:39.320
The things you can't imagine
if you've never flown at all

02:08:39.420 --> 02:08:43.699
Though it's safer to stay on the ground

02:08:43.799 --> 02:08:50.748
Sometimes where danger lies there
the sweetest of pleasures are found

02:08:50.848 --> 02:08:54.418
No matter where I go

02:08:54.518 --> 02:08:59.548
There'll be memories
that tug at my sleeve

02:08:59.648 --> 02:09:06.712
But there will also be more to
question yet more to believe

02:09:07.656 --> 02:09:12.519
Oh, tell me where

02:09:12.619 --> 02:09:17.858
Where is the someone who
will turn to look at me?

02:09:17.958 --> 02:09:22.237
And want to share

02:09:22.337 --> 02:09:28.276
My every sweet imagined possibility?

02:09:30.596 --> 02:09:37.660
The more I live, the more I learn

02:09:39.021 --> 02:09:45.710
The more I learn, the more
I realize the less I know

02:09:46.487 --> 02:09:50.557
Each step I take
Papa, I've a voice now

02:09:50.657 --> 02:09:54.269
Each page I turn
Papa, I've a choice now

02:09:54.369 --> 02:10:00.818
Each mile I travel only means
the more I have to go

02:10:00.918 --> 02:10:04.738
What's wrong with wanting more?

02:10:04.838 --> 02:10:09.118
If you can fly, then soar

02:10:09.218 --> 02:10:12.496
With all there is

02:10:12.596 --> 02:10:19.002
Why settle for

02:10:19.102 --> 02:10:25.958
Just a piece of sky?

02:10:28.612 --> 02:10:31.890
Papa, I can hear you

02:10:31.990 --> 02:10:34.852
Papa, I can see you

02:10:34.952 --> 02:10:39.205
Papa, I can feel you

02:10:39.206 --> 02:10:46.020
Papa, watch me fly

02:10:47.305 --> 02:10:53.517
