WEBVTT

00:33.400 --> 00:35.941
My name is Burt Gummer.
And I've been called many things.

00:36.336 --> 00:40.016
Gun enthusiast, monster-hunter,
doomsday-prepper.

00:40.173 --> 00:41.584
I reject all these labels.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.984
What I am is a survivalist.

00:44.144 --> 00:46.713
I've scoured the dirt and dust
of Nevada and Mexico,

00:46.813 --> 00:49.983
putting my life on the line to hunt
super-size subterranean

00:50.083 --> 00:52.485
man-eating predators called Graboids.

00:52.585 --> 00:56.723
Using a combination of local knowledge,
intuition and firepower,

00:56.823 --> 00:58.758
I've managed to control
this deadly species,

00:58.858 --> 01:00.769
and keep them confined
to the Northern Hemisphere.

01:01.194 --> 01:02.537
Join me.

01:02.695 --> 01:06.507
As I enter into and beneath
the Sands of Hell.

01:07.834 --> 01:11.671
1500 hours. Moving through
the desert of Perfection, Nevada.

01:11.771 --> 01:13.717
Ground zero for war with the Graboids.

01:13.907 --> 01:17.013
For those of you newcomers,
who don't have a clue about Graboids,

01:17.343 --> 01:18.754
let me bring you up to speed.

01:18.945 --> 01:21.748
The Graboid is a vicious
subterranean predator,

01:21.848 --> 01:25.022
about 30 feet in length
with a semi-rigid internal structure.

01:25.452 --> 01:27.153
It senses its prey seismically,

01:27.253 --> 01:31.057
and employs three powerful,
snake-like oral tentacles

01:31.157 --> 01:34.602
to ensnare its prey,
and pull it into the Graboid's gullet.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.638
It is not a pleasant venue.

01:36.796 --> 01:38.400
Trust me. I've been there.

01:38.798 --> 01:40.500
If that weren't enough,
Graboids give birth

01:40.600 --> 01:42.671
to three ugly spawn we call Shriekers.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.872
Short, squat, and blind bipedal bad boys

01:45.972 --> 01:48.942
that sense and hunt their prey
using infrared sensors.

01:49.042 --> 01:51.378
These, in turn,
give rise to the Ass Blaster,

01:51.478 --> 01:53.113
a winged, predatory carnivore

01:53.213 --> 01:55.989
which uses a mixture
of volatile chemicals in its...

01:56.382 --> 01:58.051
...nether regions

01:58.151 --> 02:00.859
to blast into the air
and swoop down upon its victims.

02:01.221 --> 02:04.391
Ass Blasters carry eggs that hatch
and become new Graboids,

02:04.491 --> 02:06.559
beginning this hellish cycle anew.

02:06.659 --> 02:11.031
I have survived a great many
skirmishes with Graboids,

02:11.131 --> 02:13.577
along with their Shrieker
and Ass Blaster kin.

02:14.067 --> 02:16.970
And that makes me uniquely qualified

02:17.070 --> 02:20.643
to teach you how to survive
whatever life throws at you.

02:21.241 --> 02:24.381
And remember, life and survival

02:24.777 --> 02:26.222
starts here.

02:31.951 --> 02:32.986
Who's hungry?

02:54.207 --> 02:55.775
What're you doing?

02:55.875 --> 02:57.479
Shut your blow hole.

02:58.411 --> 02:59.651
I'm tracking.

03:01.581 --> 03:02.924
You feel that?

03:03.149 --> 03:05.518
The only thing you're gonna feel
is my boot in your bum.

03:05.618 --> 03:07.427
Yeah, good luck,
with that gimp leg of yours.

03:07.887 --> 03:09.289
This place is gut boring.

03:09.389 --> 03:12.959
Yeah. And I'm tired, and I'm starving.

03:13.059 --> 03:15.935
And the only thing we've seen all day
is a pack of spotted hyena.

03:16.062 --> 03:17.871
Yeah, it's just the nature
of things, boet.

03:17.997 --> 03:19.732
Yeah, well, talking about nature,

03:19.832 --> 03:21.709
I'm gonna drop the kids off at the pool.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.948
Looking northwest, over the Highveld.

03:26.306 --> 03:30.385
All those reports about exotic animals,
there's no wildlife here.

03:30.510 --> 03:34.087
Well, speaking of wildlife, I wonder
if my wife's gonna come back to me.

03:34.280 --> 03:37.484
If she's got brains, definitely not.

03:37.584 --> 03:40.190
You're a complete and utter idiot.

03:40.453 --> 03:43.798
I mean, I'm hurting here. I'm in pain.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.536
And you mock me.

03:49.162 --> 03:51.731
Basson. You hear that?

03:51.831 --> 03:53.742
I didn't hear anything.
I'm in conference.

03:53.866 --> 03:55.468
It's right here. Here, here, here, here.

04:05.311 --> 04:06.619
Whoa! Whoa!

04:13.953 --> 04:15.227
Basson?

04:21.327 --> 04:23.136
Dreyer!

04:24.864 --> 04:26.104
That's a long drop.

04:26.532 --> 04:28.102
Didn't you see this gigantic hole?

04:28.301 --> 04:30.508
I think I broke my butt.

04:30.803 --> 04:31.975
I'm gonna grab a rope.

05:32.832 --> 05:35.676
Bro!

05:36.602 --> 05:38.445
I'm coming, man, relax.

05:38.838 --> 05:40.473
- Basson?
- Yeah?

05:40.573 --> 05:41.574
I'm gonna throw this rope down.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.576
You grab onto it,
I'm gonna pull you up, all right?

05:43.676 --> 05:46.316
Hurry up. There's something down here.

05:48.981 --> 05:50.016
Okay, grab the rope.

05:50.116 --> 05:51.451
Get me out of here,
there's something down here.

05:51.551 --> 05:52.552
Just get me out of here.

05:52.652 --> 05:54.962
Yeah, probably my ex-wife, Teresa.

05:55.154 --> 05:56.389
Pull!

05:56.489 --> 05:58.162
Yeah, just help me out man, come on.

06:03.463 --> 06:04.737
You need to lose some weight.

06:09.102 --> 06:12.311
Get me out of here. I'm pissing myself.

06:27.887 --> 06:29.161
Basson!

06:34.861 --> 06:35.896
Basson!

07:17.203 --> 07:18.204
Whoo!

07:22.208 --> 07:24.848
107 degrees Fahrenheit.

07:25.378 --> 07:27.051
Hello, Nevada.

07:27.346 --> 07:29.292
Oh, yeah.

08:23.803 --> 08:26.439
Everything tastes better outdoors.

08:26.539 --> 08:29.976
However, if one wants to enjoy
a source of sustenance out here,

08:30.076 --> 08:32.745
one has to seize the culinary initiative

08:32.845 --> 08:35.347
when it rears its ugly head.

08:35.982 --> 08:38.326
So, let's review.

08:38.484 --> 08:40.953
It took me 50 minutes to build
this improvised clay oven.

08:41.053 --> 08:43.523
Thirty-two minutes to
fire up the scrub wood,

08:43.623 --> 08:45.391
heat the interior,

08:45.491 --> 08:48.494
feed in that snake and seal the door.

08:48.594 --> 08:51.631
Now we wait as this little baby

08:51.731 --> 08:54.371
turns snake into snack.

09:44.350 --> 09:45.485
Whoa!

09:45.585 --> 09:47.087
That's hot!

09:47.853 --> 09:49.355
Ah!

09:49.455 --> 09:51.401
And voilÃ¡!

09:52.959 --> 09:57.806
One sizzling, succulent
piece of pure protein.

09:58.197 --> 09:59.265
Whoo!

09:59.365 --> 10:04.737
And you can bet that Burt's Bullseye
Brand Cactus Juice Marinade

10:04.837 --> 10:07.773
will eradicate any trace of that

10:07.873 --> 10:10.877
"tastes like chicken" residue.

10:17.516 --> 10:20.360
Who the hell are you?

10:20.920 --> 10:22.627
Yowza!

10:23.456 --> 10:24.696
Smells like chicken.

10:26.726 --> 10:28.967
There he is. Huh?

10:29.662 --> 10:31.464
The man, the myth, the legend.

10:31.564 --> 10:33.900
Burt effing Gummer. Travis B. Welker.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.968
Sorry, sir. I should've told you that.

10:36.068 --> 10:38.137
Don't mean to be all stalkery,
but I've been a big fan of yours

10:38.237 --> 10:40.217
since your Y2K conspiracy series.

10:40.606 --> 10:41.778
Well, I guess that's a wrap.

10:42.141 --> 10:45.816
Maintain position, Riley.
It's not Miller Time, yet.

10:45.945 --> 10:46.946
He's all yours, buddy boy.

10:47.279 --> 10:49.982
Your gear's piled over there.

10:50.082 --> 10:52.818
- And thanks for the Vegas gig.
- What Vegas gig?

10:52.985 --> 10:55.363
The Real Housewives of Las Vegas.

10:55.521 --> 10:57.023
You can't just adiÃ³s on me!

10:57.490 --> 11:01.360
It's a union gig,
pension and health. So...

11:01.460 --> 11:02.695
That is your new camera guy,

11:02.795 --> 11:04.832
and, well, he comes highly recommended.

11:05.231 --> 11:07.040
Lots of time in the eyepiece.

11:07.867 --> 11:10.473
You're officially AWOL, mister.

11:10.870 --> 11:12.271
So, I take it he didn't
give you my resume?

11:14.407 --> 11:16.512
All right, I got something for you here.

11:16.742 --> 11:18.511
This is called a digital file.

11:18.611 --> 11:21.013
It's gonna speak to my
awesome capabilities.

11:21.113 --> 11:24.285
Kind of wish your website could do
the same for you, but I can help.

11:25.284 --> 11:26.388
I beg your pardon?

11:26.519 --> 11:29.363
I'm a big fan. You know,
possibly your biggest.

11:29.622 --> 11:32.193
But the fact that you're out here
in Who-The-Hell-Cares, Nevada,

11:32.692 --> 11:35.027
smokin' rattlesnake says something.

11:35.127 --> 11:36.662
You know what it says?

11:36.762 --> 11:39.072
It says you're underachieving
big time, my man.

11:39.598 --> 11:42.442
You should be a global brand. Come on!

11:42.902 --> 11:46.179
I mean, how many monster-hunters
do you know? Huh?

11:46.739 --> 11:48.377
I know one. Burt Gummer.

11:48.741 --> 11:51.950
Last check, how many Twitter
followers did you have, huh?

11:52.778 --> 11:53.779
Zilch.

11:54.647 --> 11:56.682
Your opinion is duly noted.

11:56.782 --> 12:00.586
It's what I'm here for.
To help build out the Burt Gummer brand.

12:00.686 --> 12:04.463
I'm thinking, "Paranoid loner
meets charming whack job."

12:04.724 --> 12:06.101
I can fix you.

12:06.459 --> 12:07.870
I don't need fixing.

12:08.294 --> 12:09.932
Yo, what happened to your dome, my man?

12:10.529 --> 12:11.897
You binge watch Breaking Bad, again?

12:11.997 --> 12:14.770
You trying to appeal to a younger
demographic, get a little Pitbull on us?

12:15.134 --> 12:17.637
What I choose to do with my cranium
is none of your business.

12:19.338 --> 12:20.476
All right.

12:25.611 --> 12:27.420
This is snake, right, not rat?

12:29.648 --> 12:30.649
Whoa!

12:31.717 --> 12:34.254
That is a win.
That's a yummer from The Gummer.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.822
You know what, you look
like you could use a cold one.

12:36.922 --> 12:37.957
I know I can. You want?

12:38.424 --> 12:41.060
Hey, I think we're vibing right now,
right, Pop? You feel it?

12:41.160 --> 12:42.935
It's good talk. Where's your beer?

12:44.630 --> 12:45.631
Hey.

12:45.965 --> 12:47.239
Hands off my gear.

12:48.300 --> 12:49.438
Lighten up, Pops.

12:49.568 --> 12:50.672
You from the government?

12:51.437 --> 12:53.542
Nope. Florida.

12:54.006 --> 12:55.908
Grew up on the Gulf Coast.

12:56.008 --> 13:00.112
Panama City, Trampa, Pensacola.

13:00.212 --> 13:01.850
- Pensacola?
- Yeah.

13:02.648 --> 13:04.550
They got a great gun show.

13:04.650 --> 13:06.357
Yeah, right off the Interstate.

13:06.986 --> 13:08.397
I was there in '74.

13:08.687 --> 13:09.722
You got that look.

13:11.023 --> 13:12.058
What look?

13:12.158 --> 13:14.229
The "I did some dirty
things in Florida" look.

13:14.994 --> 13:17.634
Hey, I get it. It was the '70s,
free love, you were young.

13:24.203 --> 13:25.307
What now?

13:27.406 --> 13:29.750
Looks like the IRS finally
caught up with you.

13:31.510 --> 13:33.888
Mr. Gummer. Mr. Gummer.

13:36.348 --> 13:40.990
You are way off grid, sir,
you're a very difficult man to find.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.389
Evidently, not difficult enough.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.324
I am Erich Van Wyk.

13:45.424 --> 13:49.600
I'm with the South
African Wildlife Ministry.

13:50.629 --> 13:52.932
South Africa? You with the government?

13:53.032 --> 13:55.842
What? No, no. I'm a big fan of yours.

13:56.001 --> 13:57.036
Go on.

13:57.503 --> 14:01.144
Well, we have a rather pressing
situation in Gauteng.

14:02.007 --> 14:04.544
Gauteng. The Cradle of Humankind?

14:04.944 --> 14:06.045
Yes, that's right.

14:06.145 --> 14:10.187
We have a confirmed sighting of what
you would refer to as an Ass Blaster.

14:10.883 --> 14:13.119
That's impossible.
The species are confined

14:13.219 --> 14:14.620
to the Northern Hemisphere.

14:14.720 --> 14:18.257
Oh, well, then, I suppose
it's some other flying carnivore

14:18.357 --> 14:22.328
that shoots flame out of its rear end
that we have wreaking havoc in Africa?

14:23.696 --> 14:25.073
Is this a confirmed sighting?

14:25.331 --> 14:29.006
Oh, yes, sir. Although the witness
is no longer alive.

14:32.238 --> 14:33.911
- When do we leave?
- Excellent.

14:35.441 --> 14:38.422
Slow your roll, there, Gums. Okay.

14:40.479 --> 14:43.756
You're quite the fetching bushman,
Mr. Van Dick.

14:44.183 --> 14:45.218
It's Van Wyk.

14:45.684 --> 14:47.721
Van Wyk, right, okay. Um...

14:48.554 --> 14:51.558
Mr. Gummer really isn't
in the monster business, anymore.

14:52.057 --> 14:53.536
I'm what?

14:53.926 --> 14:55.667
Give us a minute, will you?

14:56.195 --> 14:57.429
What the hell are you doin'?

14:57.529 --> 14:58.664
I'm working this dude for some paper.

14:58.764 --> 14:59.832
Paper?

14:59.932 --> 15:02.535
Cash. Listen.

15:02.635 --> 15:04.774
You don't take the first offer.
Let me close this deal.

15:04.970 --> 15:06.506
Request denied. I work alone.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.141
Come on, but you need
a videographer, okay?

15:09.241 --> 15:11.377
You need to take
the long view on this, okay?

15:11.477 --> 15:14.253
Think about it. The Gummer in Africa.

15:14.513 --> 15:17.416
This is our chance to catch you
on tape really doing what you do,

15:17.516 --> 15:19.655
and really giving it
to those Ass Blasters.

15:21.620 --> 15:23.759
Okay, that came out weird,
but you know what I mean, right?

15:23.889 --> 15:26.768
This is real world, son.
You're a newbie.

15:27.660 --> 15:28.661
Newbie?

15:29.161 --> 15:31.530
Okay, stop being Burt for a second,
and just listen.

15:31.630 --> 15:34.901
I may have not spent most of my life
fighting giant, blind worms,

15:35.100 --> 15:38.513
but I spent the last 10 years
of my life deep in the shit.

15:39.038 --> 15:41.609
Pulling gigs for CNN
and Fox in the sandbox.

15:41.874 --> 15:45.219
Yeah, Afghanistan, Syria.
You know those places?

15:45.411 --> 15:46.446
Yeah.

15:47.346 --> 15:48.518
And as for firearms,

15:53.719 --> 15:56.199
I just added this baby to my collection.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.029
HK 91.

15:58.857 --> 16:00.302
- Where'd you get that?
- Uh-uh-uh!

16:01.026 --> 16:03.529
You punch my ticket to South Africa,

16:04.396 --> 16:09.140
and will I hand over this beautiful,
semi-automatic Mr. Shotty to you.

16:10.235 --> 16:11.373
Deal.

16:12.538 --> 16:14.779
Erich. May I call you Erich?

16:15.307 --> 16:16.308
Of course.

16:16.475 --> 16:17.743
We really appreciate your offer,

16:17.843 --> 16:21.381
but Mr. Gummer's monster-hunting
schedule's all booked up.

16:22.281 --> 16:23.453
Sorry.

16:24.116 --> 16:26.960
Oh, uh... That's a pity.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.397
Bigfoot in the Ozarks.

16:30.556 --> 16:32.229
Possible gremlin in Fresno.

16:33.625 --> 16:36.435
Family of werewolves
in Peru we heard about.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.504
Thank you for your time, gentlemen.

16:50.776 --> 16:53.846
I don't suppose it
would make any difference

16:53.946 --> 16:57.683
if I offered to fully fund

16:57.783 --> 17:00.024
Mr. Gummer's videos
for the next two years?

17:00.819 --> 17:01.820
Four.

17:02.121 --> 17:03.122
Three.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.059
What time does your plane leave?

17:06.258 --> 17:07.896
How quickly can you roll your tents?

17:09.361 --> 17:10.567
Rolled.

17:13.832 --> 17:16.711
Burt Gummer. In Africa.

17:50.035 --> 17:51.946
Africa's not for sissies, yeah?

17:52.404 --> 17:54.816
We eat what we kill here, boet.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.844
You mind if I call you boet?

17:56.975 --> 17:58.010
Boet?

17:58.110 --> 17:59.612
Yeah. It means brother.

18:01.513 --> 18:02.992
So, you're the monster-hunter?

18:03.248 --> 18:05.684
Yeah, somethin' like that.

18:05.784 --> 18:09.129
This doesn't look like
any Ass Blaster I've ever seen.

18:11.523 --> 18:13.230
- Strange attraction.
- Come again?

18:13.392 --> 18:16.669
A man who hunts a monster.
It's a strange attraction.

18:21.733 --> 18:23.041
Mr. Bravers, are you drunk?

18:25.003 --> 18:26.004
Not yet.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.441
Mr. Gummer?

18:29.541 --> 18:32.277
We're heading for a safari lodge,
just south of the river.

18:32.377 --> 18:35.022
The owner's been kind enough
to let us base our operations there.

18:35.447 --> 18:37.654
Hey, where's my bug-out bag
and the weapons I brought from home?

18:38.484 --> 18:39.918
About that.

18:40.018 --> 18:42.821
We have very strict customs laws
here in South Africa.

18:42.921 --> 18:45.629
I should have warned you about
the three-day weapons quarantine.

18:45.757 --> 18:46.725
Three-day what?

18:46.825 --> 18:49.094
Don't worry about it.
I've procured us some weapons.

18:49.194 --> 18:50.229
They're waiting for us at the lodge.

18:50.562 --> 18:51.973
There, there it is, there, there.

19:22.227 --> 19:24.400
Nice digs, Van Dyke.

19:24.696 --> 19:26.175
It's Van Wyk.

19:29.034 --> 19:30.369
- Hey, boet.
- Yeah?

19:30.469 --> 19:31.971
I got a story for you.

19:32.137 --> 19:35.607
Every morning in Africa,
a gazelle wakes up.

19:36.141 --> 19:40.453
And he knows he's gotta run
faster than the fastest lion,

19:40.579 --> 19:41.922
otherwise...

19:42.681 --> 19:44.092
He gets killed.

19:44.283 --> 19:47.264
Every morning, a lion wakes up.

19:47.386 --> 19:51.156
And he knows he's gotta outrun
the slowest gazelle,

19:51.256 --> 19:54.135
otherwise he's gonna starve to death.

19:54.426 --> 19:58.067
So, it doesn't matter if you are
a lion or you're a gazelle,

19:58.764 --> 20:02.871
in Africa, when the sun rises,
you better be running.

20:04.503 --> 20:08.576
Hey, if you need my help,
call me on the horn.

20:09.174 --> 20:11.110
Mmm.

20:18.383 --> 20:20.021
- Now, you go well, boet.
- Thank you.

20:27.826 --> 20:29.361
Chop-chop, Pops.

20:29.461 --> 20:31.163
Stop calling me "Pops."

20:31.263 --> 20:32.598
Got you.

20:32.698 --> 20:34.109
Old man.

20:36.969 --> 20:38.346
And we're clear!

20:38.470 --> 20:39.771
What? I don't understand.

20:39.871 --> 20:41.873
This is a seismic vibration monitor.

20:42.207 --> 20:44.910
It's uplinked to the South African
National Grid of Seismology

20:45.010 --> 20:48.080
and can detect Graboid movement
within a 50 square-mile area.

20:48.180 --> 20:49.318
Next level type stuff.

20:49.448 --> 20:50.816
Graboid? Worms?

20:50.916 --> 20:52.156
Exactly.

20:52.484 --> 20:53.852
This is Johan Dreyer.

20:53.952 --> 20:58.123
He's my local field representative
and a safari guide in the area.

20:58.223 --> 20:59.591
He's the one who witnessed
the fatal attack.

20:59.691 --> 21:00.792
That's right.

21:00.892 --> 21:04.806
And this towering hunk of dark chocolate
is my assistant, Thaba.

21:05.864 --> 21:06.934
That's quite a gun you got there.

21:07.332 --> 21:08.300
Rifle.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.243
Bet it makes you feel like
you got a lot of power.

21:10.636 --> 21:13.139
I can drop a charging
rhino at 100 meters.

21:13.372 --> 21:14.510
You wanna go for a run?

21:15.707 --> 21:17.015
How's life in the Thunderdome?

21:17.643 --> 21:19.011
Well, you wouldn't know
what a rhino looked like

21:19.111 --> 21:20.556
if it shoved its horn
through your throat.

21:22.581 --> 21:27.262
Graboids and Ass Blasters are immune
to any known form of tranquilizer,

21:27.819 --> 21:30.959
rendering your weapon useless against
the creatures we're hunting.

21:31.223 --> 21:34.102
Capturing. Capturing,
that's the plan, right?

21:34.593 --> 21:37.403
You don't capture these things.
You kill them.

21:38.397 --> 21:39.598
Kill them, capture them, I don't care.

21:39.698 --> 21:42.440
But what we have in Africa, sir,
is not Graboids.

21:44.403 --> 21:48.180
If you've got Ass Blasters,
you've got Graboids.

22:12.397 --> 22:13.569
Odontotermes baadi.

22:14.399 --> 22:15.503
Yes.

22:15.967 --> 22:18.140
But on a massive scale.

22:18.437 --> 22:20.508
It has the same magnesium mandibles.

22:21.406 --> 22:25.149
That explains the presence of formic acid
in the bedrock surrounding it.

22:25.277 --> 22:28.186
It spits out the acid to soften the rocks,
while the mandibles chew through it.

22:30.248 --> 22:31.454
This is a super digger.

22:33.585 --> 22:36.065
We're going to be on the cover
of Science magazine.

22:36.588 --> 22:38.090
Been there, baby.

22:38.457 --> 22:40.232
I want National Geographic.

22:48.867 --> 22:50.369
Whoo!

23:13.625 --> 23:14.626
Ugh!

23:20.232 --> 23:23.270
Mr. Gummer. Mr. Gummer. Over here.

23:23.602 --> 23:27.072
Can you say, "Ballin'"?

23:27.873 --> 23:29.284
Hey, what's the Zulu word for "ballin'"?

23:32.811 --> 23:36.348
Hello, Baruti.
Taking the kids for a walk, I see?

23:36.448 --> 23:37.783
Well, you know that these young ladies

23:37.883 --> 23:40.625
are too high-class for the likes of you,
so, I guess somebody has to do it.

23:43.922 --> 23:44.957
Just act natural.

23:45.657 --> 23:48.399
These men are here investigating
the impundulu attack.

23:48.760 --> 23:51.138
Oh, right, the monster-hunters, right?

23:51.730 --> 23:55.268
Ish. I'm still in training,
but I got, like, a credit away.

24:02.607 --> 24:03.779
There.

24:04.176 --> 24:07.487
You want guns, Burt?
This is how we roll.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.755
Wow.

24:11.583 --> 24:13.119
Here you go.

24:13.952 --> 24:14.987
What's this?

24:15.420 --> 24:16.922
The weapons you asked for.

24:17.589 --> 24:21.093
A BSA .303 and a .30-06?

24:21.359 --> 24:25.063
Well, there's also a Colt Peacemaker.

24:25.163 --> 24:26.198
And a...

24:26.832 --> 24:29.142
Ooh! The double-barrel thingy.

24:29.334 --> 24:32.110
Are you serious?
We might as well use a spit straw.

24:32.370 --> 24:33.805
Granted, it's not everything
you requested.

24:33.905 --> 24:37.920
No, what I requested was confiscated
by your mindless government lackeys.

24:38.076 --> 24:39.555
Yes, I'm sorry about that.

24:39.711 --> 24:41.246
They don't just hand out machine guns

24:41.346 --> 24:44.225
to every jacked-up safari jockey
that comes to this country.

24:44.683 --> 24:46.128
This is Africa, Mr. Gummer.

24:46.952 --> 24:48.260
But we're not all bushies.

24:48.620 --> 24:50.989
Was that racist?
That sounded a little racist.

24:51.089 --> 24:52.124
Bushist.

24:52.224 --> 24:54.159
You promised me adequate weaponry.

24:54.259 --> 24:56.294
What do you think we're hunting,
Rocky, the flying squirrel?

24:56.394 --> 24:59.637
That .30-06 will drop
anything on this continent.

25:00.031 --> 25:01.066
Anything.

25:03.001 --> 25:04.378
Who's this?

25:06.872 --> 25:07.873
Hey.

25:07.973 --> 25:09.043
Hi.

25:09.674 --> 25:10.642
What are you doing?

25:10.742 --> 25:12.619
Zapping worms for bait.

25:14.079 --> 25:15.990
Look. Here they come.

25:17.749 --> 25:18.784
Damn!

25:19.050 --> 25:20.051
Whoo-hoo!

25:22.854 --> 25:23.855
You got any wasabi?

25:24.089 --> 25:25.124
Eat it.

25:25.957 --> 25:27.325
- Eat it?
- Eat it.

25:27.425 --> 25:28.768
African tradition.

25:37.302 --> 25:38.713
Is it really African tradition?

25:39.104 --> 25:40.947
- No.
- Oh, God.

25:44.876 --> 25:46.583
Travis, Travis.

25:46.778 --> 25:49.554
This is Dr. Nandi Montabu.
She owns the reserve.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.416
Hey, Doctor.

25:51.516 --> 25:52.484
Nandi is fine.

25:52.584 --> 25:55.463
No, free Wi-Fi at a coffee shop is fine.

25:55.687 --> 25:56.822
You are like a holiday drink.

25:56.922 --> 25:59.791
Like a caramel macchiato
pumpkin spice latte,

25:59.891 --> 26:01.928
but instead of pumpkin,
it's African spice.

26:02.160 --> 26:04.529
Okay, well, sounds delicious.

26:04.629 --> 26:06.165
Thank you. You must be Travis.

26:06.531 --> 26:08.306
At ease, Mr. Welker.

26:08.500 --> 26:09.604
Mr. Gummer, welcome.

26:09.901 --> 26:12.575
Um... I've arranged some refreshments
for you back at the lodge.

26:12.704 --> 26:14.573
- With all due respect, Doctor...
- It's Nandi.

26:14.673 --> 26:16.619
Nandi, I think we should
get right to the hunt.

26:16.841 --> 26:20.152
Let's rest up, Mr. Gummer.
Start fresh in the morning, yes?

26:20.512 --> 26:22.185
I'm not here on a safari weekend.

26:23.348 --> 26:25.954
If you've got Graboids, no one is safe.

26:29.054 --> 26:31.125
Travis, did you eat the worm?

27:04.656 --> 27:05.691
Well, hello.

27:07.826 --> 27:08.861
We did it.

27:09.661 --> 27:10.696
You did it.

27:10.962 --> 27:12.597
Yeah. I hate to go
back to the real world

27:12.697 --> 27:14.438
and lecture at stoned-out students.

27:18.903 --> 27:21.474
Be nice to stay out here
in the bush, with you.

27:22.107 --> 27:24.451
I wish this moment would last
the rest of my life.

28:09.421 --> 28:10.957
That's where Basson died.

28:11.322 --> 28:13.124
- Coordinates?
- What?

28:13.224 --> 28:14.897
Longitude and latitude?

28:15.160 --> 28:16.264
I don't do coordinates.

28:16.394 --> 28:18.797
Everything is in my head.

28:18.897 --> 28:20.399
What about field communications?

28:22.934 --> 28:24.971
- What the hell was that?
- A monkey's wedding.

28:26.271 --> 28:28.376
Local lingo. Sun shower.

28:28.540 --> 28:31.850
We get them every day, at this time
of the year, at the exact same hour.

28:31.976 --> 28:33.046
You can set your watch to it.

28:33.278 --> 28:34.412
1500 hours.

28:34.512 --> 28:35.547
Exactly.

28:35.647 --> 28:37.524
Mother Nature keeps to her rhythms.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.119
Dr. Montabu. Nandi?

28:41.219 --> 28:42.320
Yes?

28:42.420 --> 28:43.922
I think you guys
might wanna come and see this.

28:44.022 --> 28:45.357
Why?

28:45.457 --> 28:46.561
There's been another attack.

29:47.252 --> 29:50.426
An Ass Blaster definitely
didn't do this, Mr. Van Wyk.

30:06.905 --> 30:07.940
Hey, Gums.

30:09.507 --> 30:11.384
You may wanna check this out.

30:14.012 --> 30:16.925
If you're dumb, you bleed.

30:27.759 --> 30:30.399
Your problem is bigger
than I thought, Mr. Van Wyk.

30:30.528 --> 30:31.563
How so?

30:32.397 --> 30:35.238
This Graboid is much larger
than the North American variety.

30:35.433 --> 30:37.572
It's Africa. Everything's bigger.

30:37.702 --> 30:39.204
Everything except my munitions.

30:39.437 --> 30:41.639
Knowing your enemy's
strength is Intel 101.

30:41.739 --> 30:43.412
What other surprises
do you have in store for me?

30:43.775 --> 30:45.812
I'm learning as I go, Mr. Gummer.

30:49.981 --> 30:52.791
This one's leaner, too. Much leaner.

30:53.451 --> 30:54.589
And more dangerous.

30:59.357 --> 31:01.496
We're gonna need a big-ass cage.

31:18.476 --> 31:19.911
Jeez, Gummy-drops, we get it.

31:20.011 --> 31:21.217
You like to get cozy with your guns.

31:21.679 --> 31:24.382
Not just cozy, Mr. Welker. Conjoined.

31:24.482 --> 31:25.517
This is a hot zone.

31:26.084 --> 31:28.496
Hey, what was that ministry Van Wyk
said he was affiliated with?

31:28.620 --> 31:30.827
South African Wildlife Federation. Why?

31:31.589 --> 31:32.590
Just curious.

31:33.224 --> 31:34.225
Hey!

31:35.159 --> 31:36.194
You want a ride?

31:36.394 --> 31:37.566
No, I'll see you over there.

31:39.597 --> 31:41.432
See her where?

31:41.532 --> 31:43.637
Oh, she invited me to
some tribal dance thing.

31:44.035 --> 31:45.708
We move out at 2200 hours.

31:45.837 --> 31:48.215
I suggest you grab some chow
and get some rack time.

31:48.473 --> 31:50.817
Wait. Are you giving me a curfew?

31:51.209 --> 31:54.986
I don't do curfews, Pops.
Okay? I'm an adult.

31:55.113 --> 31:56.614
But here's what I suggest you do.

31:56.714 --> 31:58.887
I think you should go inside, right?

31:59.017 --> 32:00.618
Check out the mini-bar situation.

32:00.718 --> 32:02.493
See how your 401 is doing.

32:02.687 --> 32:06.692
And I'll download the intel
from the smokin' hot South African chick.

32:08.026 --> 32:10.905
And I am gonna dance with the natives.

32:40.091 --> 32:41.297
Hey!

32:41.559 --> 32:42.902
Come here!

32:49.968 --> 32:51.069
Hey!

32:51.169 --> 32:52.273
Hey!

32:52.503 --> 32:54.176
- You made it.
- Wow.

32:55.640 --> 32:56.674
This is quite the rager.

32:56.774 --> 32:57.809
Yeah.

32:58.543 --> 33:00.545
- You guys got a keg?
- Yeah.

33:02.480 --> 33:03.754
Try this.

33:05.416 --> 33:06.986
- What's this?
- Courage.

33:14.525 --> 33:15.629
And?

33:16.794 --> 33:18.102
It tastes like cow piss.

33:18.529 --> 33:20.167
- You want more? Try again.
- No, I really don't.

33:24.102 --> 33:25.410
So, what is this?

33:25.703 --> 33:27.182
This is a warrior dance.

33:27.538 --> 33:30.519
Our ancestors hunting the Inkanyamba
and the impundulu.

33:30.775 --> 33:31.743
What's that?

33:31.843 --> 33:34.881
Impundulu. It's what
you call the Ass Blaster.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.083
- Ass Blaster.
- Yes.

33:36.514 --> 33:37.584
Yes.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.792
Hey, you know, you make
Ass Blaster sound good.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.125
You know, Thaba,
I'm really not sure about these guys.

33:44.989 --> 33:46.900
Especially this Travis guy. I mean...

33:47.759 --> 33:49.363
I don't like the way
he's looking at my Nandi.

33:50.695 --> 33:51.696
Is she your Nandi, now?

33:53.464 --> 33:54.772
Yeah, well, she could be.

33:55.533 --> 33:57.069
Good luck with that, bro.

33:57.535 --> 33:58.673
A guy can dream, right?

33:59.704 --> 34:02.446
Dream us up a couple
of cold ones, would you?

34:02.740 --> 34:04.083
Hundreds, boet.

34:04.509 --> 34:05.510
Ah...

34:25.530 --> 34:26.907
To dreams.

34:49.253 --> 34:51.199
Jesus Christ!

35:01.165 --> 35:02.166
Okay.

35:02.300 --> 35:05.841
What you call the Ass Blaster, in our
language, the word means "lightning bird."

35:10.541 --> 35:12.350
The impundulu are nocturnal hunters.

35:14.812 --> 35:17.081
They have bio-sensors on their foreheads

35:17.181 --> 35:19.388
and their hunt is
based on heat signatures.

35:19.617 --> 35:22.826
If they hunt during the day,
their targeting might be confused.

35:22.987 --> 35:26.657
So, those freaks come out at night, so
they can hunt their prey in cooler temps?

35:26.757 --> 35:28.600
Yes, they're like vampires.

36:23.981 --> 36:25.858
No, no, no!

36:29.120 --> 36:30.258
It just took off with Thaba.

36:30.555 --> 36:32.262
It was attracted to the engine heat.

36:32.790 --> 36:33.958
The engine was cold.

36:34.058 --> 36:35.159
We gotta get Thaba.

36:35.259 --> 36:36.670
I'll get my gear.

36:54.378 --> 36:56.949
Whoa, boet. Is that Thaba?

36:57.415 --> 36:58.985
Kill the engine.

37:03.721 --> 37:06.565
HPF 250. Heat-blocking gear.

37:07.658 --> 37:11.128
You got one of those
ball gowns for me, princess?

37:11.562 --> 37:14.338
Turn on the AC, if you wanna
hide your heat signature.

37:29.513 --> 37:31.254
Yeah, tough guy.

37:37.321 --> 37:38.356
Thaba.

37:41.492 --> 37:42.527
Hey.

37:44.862 --> 37:46.205
Thaba.

37:51.068 --> 37:54.140
I have better things to do
than babysit Americans in Africa.

38:09.520 --> 38:10.655
Thaba!

38:16.627 --> 38:17.970
Hold on, I got you.

38:33.010 --> 38:34.645
Damn. I'm out.

38:34.745 --> 38:38.716
C'mon, boet. Come on,
you old fart, let's get moving.

38:47.191 --> 38:50.331
Help me, boet! Get this thing
off me, boet! Help me, boet!

39:05.476 --> 39:07.683
I stuffed his blazing butt.

39:08.646 --> 39:10.455
You're like freakin' Rambo.

39:10.715 --> 39:11.921
Let's boogie.

39:27.431 --> 39:28.432
Hey, what happened?

39:28.566 --> 39:29.834
The question is where were you?

39:29.934 --> 39:31.335
- He was with me.
- Really?

39:31.435 --> 39:32.903
Well, here's some intel for you, Doc.

39:33.003 --> 39:36.109
Those fart-flaming sons of bitches
have crossed your DMZ.

39:36.407 --> 39:38.546
You need to evacuate everyone, ASAP.

39:38.743 --> 39:39.844
Thank God you're here, Mr. Gummer.

39:39.944 --> 39:42.813
All right, load every gun.
We're going after them.

39:42.913 --> 39:44.982
- We leave in 10.
- I'll hitch the lion cage.

39:45.082 --> 39:47.858
I don't think so, Yankee.
My cage, my hitch.

39:49.520 --> 39:50.621
Hey, Gummy Bears, wait up.

39:50.721 --> 39:51.893
Don't call me that.

39:52.289 --> 39:53.393
Wait up.

39:55.092 --> 39:57.368
Number one, don't ever touch me
like that again.

39:57.561 --> 40:00.898
Number two, don't ever touch me
like that again.

40:00.998 --> 40:02.333
You copy?

40:02.433 --> 40:03.401
Yeah, I copy.

40:03.501 --> 40:05.879
I don't have the time
to posture for your camera!

40:06.203 --> 40:08.406
This was a mistake, havin' you along.

40:08.506 --> 40:10.417
Just another pimple
on the ass of progress.

40:11.375 --> 40:12.376
You need to chill out.

40:12.610 --> 40:16.180
Don't tell me to chill. You were AWOL.

40:16.280 --> 40:19.583
Now, we've got another K.I.A. and
a full-scale A.B. incursion to deal with.

40:19.683 --> 40:20.718
You want to make yourself useful?

40:21.285 --> 40:22.525
Go help with the evac.

40:23.053 --> 40:25.761
Then, feel free to join in.
Think you can manage that?

40:26.690 --> 40:29.603
Mr. Gummer.
I think you'll find this useful.

40:30.561 --> 40:31.733
There is a God.

40:31.996 --> 40:33.297
R5.

40:33.397 --> 40:34.808
Full banana clip.

40:35.332 --> 40:36.333
I zeroed the scope myself.

40:36.500 --> 40:37.808
Where'd you get this?

40:37.935 --> 40:39.073
You don't want to know.

40:39.503 --> 40:42.780
I like your style. A-frickin'-men.

40:45.109 --> 40:47.385
What's a veterinarian
doing with a machine gun?

40:54.084 --> 40:56.087
They must've flown
in north of the river.

40:56.187 --> 40:58.667
Ass Blasters don't fly, they glide.

40:59.056 --> 41:02.326
They mix several volatile
gastrointestinal chemicals

41:02.426 --> 41:05.464
that actually ignite,
allowing them to achieve blast off.

41:08.399 --> 41:11.539
They fart to take off? That's funny.

41:13.037 --> 41:16.041
Shh. Listen. You hear that?

41:17.441 --> 41:18.920
Black-backed jackals.

41:19.276 --> 41:20.311
Scavengers.

41:20.411 --> 41:23.551
All right. Take it ahead and kill
the engine. We'll have a look.

41:40.231 --> 41:41.835
You sure do come prepared, Mr. Gummer.

41:43.734 --> 41:46.309
Basson was killed on that koppie,
just underneath that cliff face.

41:47.238 --> 41:49.479
I think we have our Ass Blaster colony.

41:49.974 --> 41:51.709
What about the bait?
Don't we need to make it hot

41:51.809 --> 41:53.049
so these bastards can see it?

41:53.978 --> 41:55.513
For sports injuries.

41:55.613 --> 41:57.092
Forget the meat.

41:57.481 --> 41:58.892
We need heat.

42:00.150 --> 42:01.151
Happiness.

42:01.852 --> 42:03.229
Okay, unhook the cage.

42:17.868 --> 42:19.245
Gotcha.

42:24.108 --> 42:25.246
Is that it?

42:26.076 --> 42:28.022
Sure as hell ain't Mickey Mouse.

42:28.646 --> 42:31.820
Stand behind me so he can't
read your heat signature.

43:08.352 --> 43:11.265
Remember, Mr. Gummer, capture, not kill.

43:20.264 --> 43:22.471
Easy. Take your damn shot.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.580
Say hello to my dart, bitch.

43:27.905 --> 43:28.906
Don't panic.

43:29.173 --> 43:30.652
Hold your position!

43:31.308 --> 43:32.343
Easy.

43:32.443 --> 43:33.786
Screw that, I'm out of here!

43:33.978 --> 43:35.286
No, stay with me, stay!

44:02.873 --> 44:04.250
That's right.

44:04.842 --> 44:08.245
Fly right into my crosshairs,

44:08.345 --> 44:11.383
you fire-farting son of a bitch.

44:11.715 --> 44:14.992
You can't kill me. I'm African.

44:19.289 --> 44:21.200
Ass-Blast flambÃ©.

44:24.495 --> 44:25.997
What did you do?

44:27.331 --> 44:28.537
Why'd you kill it?

44:31.769 --> 44:33.612
And Dreyer, too?

44:38.442 --> 44:40.285
- Nandi, Amahle!
- Yeah?

44:44.648 --> 44:45.683
I think you left this in my truck.

44:46.050 --> 44:47.529
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

44:47.918 --> 44:49.453
Nandi. After we evacuate,

44:49.553 --> 44:52.399
I was thinking that maybe I should
take you and Amahle somewhere safer.

44:52.623 --> 44:54.694
There's so much work to do.
I can't leave this place now.

44:54.892 --> 44:56.166
In that case, I'm staying here.

44:58.095 --> 44:59.096
With you.

45:01.932 --> 45:02.933
Me, too.

45:04.935 --> 45:06.107
Really?

45:08.038 --> 45:11.247
You know what,
try not to shoot each other, okay?

45:13.544 --> 45:14.955
This doesn't add up.

45:15.779 --> 45:17.281
Ignored the thermal flare.

45:18.782 --> 45:20.386
Came directly at us.

45:28.125 --> 45:32.198
Protecting the nest,
weren't you? Roger that.

45:33.997 --> 45:35.999
Where there are Ass Blasters,

45:37.568 --> 45:39.309
there are Graboids.

45:43.841 --> 45:46.248
Sorry, I'm going to have to take
that little money-maker from you.

45:46.677 --> 45:47.678
What're you doing?

45:48.112 --> 45:50.820
Cashing in, hopefully.
Why don't you hand that over?

45:51.215 --> 45:52.785
I should've known you were dirty.

45:54.084 --> 45:55.986
Thought it was
the luckiest day of my life.

45:56.086 --> 45:57.855
I send Dreyer out to get a cheetah cub,

45:57.955 --> 46:00.435
and he runs smack-bang
into a flying carnivore.

46:01.625 --> 46:02.693
Who are you?

46:02.793 --> 46:03.894
Let's start with who I'm not.

46:03.994 --> 46:07.066
I'm not with the South
African Wildlife Ministry.

46:07.431 --> 46:08.766
This is not gonna end good for you.

46:08.866 --> 46:09.970
Sure it will.

46:10.367 --> 46:12.236
An Ass Blaster
would've fetched 100 times

46:12.336 --> 46:14.872
what a cheetah cub or
a rhino horn would've.

46:14.972 --> 46:17.009
Dead one, not nearly so much.

46:17.441 --> 46:18.943
You're a common poacher?

46:19.076 --> 46:20.953
Morally, I'm okay with it.

46:21.111 --> 46:23.489
You. Not so much.

46:23.881 --> 46:27.021
Now, get into the cage,
or I'll shoot you in the stomach.

46:29.019 --> 46:30.362
Shoot me.

46:31.054 --> 46:32.158
Kill me.

46:33.190 --> 46:34.999
But you won't cage me.

46:39.997 --> 46:41.738
It ain't over

46:42.432 --> 46:43.740
till it's over.

46:48.806 --> 46:49.784
Useless!

46:50.374 --> 46:51.876
Damn. Ow!

46:55.179 --> 46:56.214
Hot.

46:56.847 --> 46:57.951
Hot.

47:02.219 --> 47:03.253
Ah!

47:03.353 --> 47:05.594
The call of nature.

47:10.060 --> 47:11.762
The Maasai have been using urine

47:11.862 --> 47:15.105
as an insect repellent for centuries.

47:25.342 --> 47:29.119
This may be the last will and testament

47:29.613 --> 47:32.560
of Mr. Bertram Gummer.

47:33.750 --> 47:34.785
Heather.

47:35.652 --> 47:37.290
If you're still out there,

47:39.756 --> 47:44.830
give the HK 41 a good home.

47:45.762 --> 47:47.503
I miss it.

47:50.033 --> 47:51.808
And to some extent, you.

47:56.206 --> 47:58.709
Bastard Van Wyk.

47:58.909 --> 48:02.152
If I ever get out of here alive,

48:02.746 --> 48:04.692
I am coming for you.

48:06.750 --> 48:07.885
Ah!

48:19.730 --> 48:21.835
Definitely an acquired taste.

48:27.704 --> 48:29.239
Is it over yet?

48:31.275 --> 48:33.043
Oh, no, no, no.

48:33.143 --> 48:35.350
Cue the freakin' lion.

48:40.217 --> 48:41.355
I can't hear you.

48:42.886 --> 48:44.331
Two alphas.

48:45.055 --> 48:46.625
One understanding.

48:46.757 --> 48:49.636
It's lonely on top
of the food chain. Huh?

48:52.729 --> 48:55.869
Oh, God. We're getting
to know one another.

48:59.736 --> 49:01.238
Shade, at last.

49:15.786 --> 49:18.824
Shit! No. No!

49:19.222 --> 49:20.826
No, no, no!

49:21.692 --> 49:22.932
Pussy!

49:28.131 --> 49:30.304
I'll take you down.

49:30.734 --> 49:34.807
Thus I give up my spear.

49:35.572 --> 49:39.343
I will claw my way

49:39.443 --> 49:41.684
down your gullet.

49:57.260 --> 49:59.196
You picked a weird time
to start meditating, dude.

49:59.296 --> 50:01.531
- What the hell you doing here?
- I'm taking you back to the zoo.

50:01.631 --> 50:03.834
You drove straight into a kill zone,
you moron.

50:03.934 --> 50:06.436
There's a Graboid right behind you.
Get to high ground, now.

50:06.536 --> 50:09.039
This might get a bit bumpy.

50:10.107 --> 50:12.451
Hang on to your frosting.

50:16.279 --> 50:17.781
Hang on, Burt!

50:18.515 --> 50:20.153
Whoo-hoo!

50:20.817 --> 50:23.388
You missed that last stop sign.

50:24.955 --> 50:27.697
I think I'll walk the rest of the way.

50:28.425 --> 50:30.632
You wanted to be outdoors.

50:30.794 --> 50:32.637
Damn you, Travis!

50:33.096 --> 50:34.973
How's Africa taste, Burt?

50:35.966 --> 50:39.846
Go! Get on the rocks. On the rocks!

50:40.737 --> 50:43.616
The rocks! On the rocks!

50:47.878 --> 50:49.050
Oh, shit!

50:55.218 --> 50:57.323
My bad. You okay?

51:04.561 --> 51:06.930
You damn near broke
every bone in my body.

51:07.030 --> 51:09.169
Yeah, but what does that have
to do with me saving your life?

51:10.233 --> 51:15.839
I swear, I saw Graboid markers.
I must be delirious.

51:15.939 --> 51:17.714
You're welcome. Pops.

51:17.908 --> 51:19.615
I told you not to call me that.

51:20.243 --> 51:21.678
How'd you know where I was?

51:21.778 --> 51:23.155
Remote viewing.

51:24.014 --> 51:25.493
Yeah, I spent a little time in the NSA.

51:26.516 --> 51:28.792
Smile, you're on candid camera.

51:37.928 --> 51:39.839
Sorry, I forgot your underwear.

51:41.198 --> 51:42.766
We've been betrayed.

51:42.866 --> 51:44.001
Van Dick?

51:44.101 --> 51:45.335
How'd you know?

51:45.435 --> 51:48.138
I knew the guy wasn't your typical,
run-of-the-mill D-bag.

51:48.238 --> 51:50.411
So, I did a full,
digital cavity search on him.

51:51.007 --> 51:53.078
And guess what? Poser!

51:53.577 --> 51:56.780
Yeah, that whole South African
Wildlife Federation,

51:56.880 --> 51:57.881
it's not even a thing.

51:57.981 --> 52:00.650
He's got a Graboid egg, he intends
to sell it on the black market,

52:00.750 --> 52:03.162
the implications of
which are unfathomable.

52:04.554 --> 52:06.090
- You fart?
- No.

52:07.090 --> 52:08.258
You smell gas?

52:08.358 --> 52:09.496
Affirmative.

52:18.268 --> 52:19.508
Fuel line's busted.

52:20.103 --> 52:21.741
Good news is I can fix it.

52:22.806 --> 52:26.083
Bad news is we're outta gas.

52:27.077 --> 52:28.784
You didn't bring a spare jerry can?

52:29.079 --> 52:31.882
No, Burt, I forgot a spare jerry can

52:31.982 --> 52:33.583
'cause I was rushing to save your ass.

52:33.683 --> 52:34.753
And we've got no talk?

52:38.421 --> 52:39.956
No bars, no Wi-Fi in the bush.

52:40.056 --> 52:41.501
You must feel right at home.

52:42.626 --> 52:45.368
We got to get to high ground,
so we can get a cell signal.

52:53.236 --> 52:54.374
Hi.

53:09.219 --> 53:10.220
What was that?

53:24.501 --> 53:25.639
Are you okay, Nena?

53:26.036 --> 53:27.437
There's something out there, Mama.

53:27.537 --> 53:29.272
I know, baby, I know.

53:29.372 --> 53:32.509
Baruti. Baruti. Please take her
to her room, now, okay?

53:32.609 --> 53:35.749
Come on, Amahle. Let's go.

53:52.929 --> 53:55.699
Give me the spy thing
you're always looking through.

53:55.799 --> 53:57.634
- Oh! Field glasses?
- Or binoculars.

53:57.734 --> 54:00.078
Yeah, whatever, Tommy Technical.
Give 'em to me, let's go.

54:07.877 --> 54:08.878
Anything?

54:09.212 --> 54:10.881
- Oh, crap.
- What?

54:10.981 --> 54:13.994
There's no sign of Van Dick,
but I got a bead on his Land Cruiser.

54:14.684 --> 54:16.686
He must be creeping
around here somewhere.

54:19.689 --> 54:20.790
What, are you ready for a gun fight?

54:20.890 --> 54:22.335
Let's do this.

55:20.450 --> 55:21.451
Go, go!

55:25.655 --> 55:26.895
Burt, wait up.

55:51.147 --> 55:52.449
There goes his trade-in value.

55:52.549 --> 55:53.823
Tracks here.

55:55.185 --> 55:57.187
- Serpentine.
- It's Graboid?

55:57.520 --> 55:58.521
Uh-uh.

56:00.090 --> 56:01.228
And human.

56:01.958 --> 56:03.437
Van Wyk's. He was running.

56:08.531 --> 56:11.273
Ooh! Hey, Burt, got some
war porn for you.

56:11.968 --> 56:13.311
You might like that.

56:13.870 --> 56:15.349
Phosphorus. I'm lovin' it.

56:19.876 --> 56:21.753
I got dibs on the broomstick.

56:22.879 --> 56:23.949
Damn.

56:25.281 --> 56:26.283
Oh, Yeah. Yes.

56:26.383 --> 56:27.794
Locked and loaded.

56:51.775 --> 56:54.278
Okay. Stay calm.

56:55.245 --> 56:56.315
Come on.

57:48.631 --> 57:49.632
Take that.

58:43.953 --> 58:45.054
Mama.

58:45.154 --> 58:46.224
Hey.

58:47.090 --> 58:48.491
I'm so glad you're here.

58:48.591 --> 58:50.002
Hey. You okay?

58:54.531 --> 58:56.943
Yeah. Gang's all here.

59:05.375 --> 59:09.915
They're coming! They're coming!
They're coming! Help.

59:10.780 --> 59:12.048
Help me! They're coming!

59:12.148 --> 59:13.422
Dear God!

59:13.650 --> 59:15.721
They're coming! Help!

59:21.958 --> 59:22.959
Freeze.

59:23.826 --> 59:25.032
Where are you?

59:30.900 --> 59:34.245
That's my egg. Give me back my egg.

59:35.838 --> 59:37.740
Move, get up on the rocks!

59:37.840 --> 59:39.909
On the rocks!

59:40.009 --> 59:43.320
They can't reach you on the rocks.
They can't get you up there.

59:46.683 --> 59:47.650
Ow!

59:50.053 --> 59:51.361
Stay on the rock.

59:52.155 --> 59:53.828
Don't move. Freeze there.

01:00:00.129 --> 01:00:01.233
That's my egg.

01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:03.473
These Grabs are on HGH.

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:19.349
Are you frickin' kidding me?

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:21.895
The tentacles have detached
from the Graboid.

01:00:36.432 --> 01:00:37.934
You're in the Burt zone now.

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:47.944
Why is it the critical,
need-to-know information

01:00:48.044 --> 01:00:49.955
never gets to Burt Gummer?

01:00:51.247 --> 01:00:52.315
Well, maybe nobody knew.

01:00:52.415 --> 01:00:53.550
Nobody knew it?

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:56.688
Nobody knew the friggin' bastards
have gone free range?

01:01:02.725 --> 01:01:03.726
It's all right.

01:01:26.449 --> 01:01:28.151
Holy shit balls.

01:01:28.251 --> 01:01:29.924
Evolution run amok.

01:01:31.921 --> 01:01:33.756
I don't understand.

01:01:33.856 --> 01:01:36.159
This African life cycle has mutated.

01:01:36.259 --> 01:01:39.162
It's much more evolved, more efficient.

01:01:39.262 --> 01:01:43.099
Nocturnal Ass Blasters,
Grabbers that detach from the host.

01:01:43.199 --> 01:01:45.068
And where the hell are the Shriekers?

01:01:45.168 --> 01:01:47.580
What's next? Graboids that talk?

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:49.639
Okay, Burt, keep it together, all right?

01:01:49.739 --> 01:01:50.843
Try not to have a breakdown.

01:01:51.207 --> 01:01:53.042
Let's just try to focus on one thing.

01:01:53.142 --> 01:01:56.385
Why were they zeroing
in on that ice chest?

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:01.457
They were going for the egg.

01:02:02.585 --> 01:02:03.920
Propagation of the species.

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:06.762
The Ass Blasters are protecting
the Graboid bloodline.

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:14.497
So, you're sayin' there's some
seriously gnarly shit in that cave.

01:02:14.597 --> 01:02:17.867
Like, it's really beast heavy,
Graboid Ground Zero?

01:02:17.967 --> 01:02:21.337
We gotta get in that cave,
destroy that nest.

01:02:21.437 --> 01:02:23.474
We can't allow those eggs to hatch.

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:28.011
You sit tight. I'm goin' in.

01:02:28.111 --> 01:02:29.445
Since when are you in command?

01:02:29.545 --> 01:02:31.314
Since... Shut up, Burt.

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:32.782
I don't need your crap.

01:02:32.882 --> 01:02:34.183
Oh, really?

01:02:34.283 --> 01:02:37.654
Yeah, Burt don't need nothin' except
Fiber One cereal, prune juice,

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:39.889
man khakis and a monster to hunt.

01:02:39.989 --> 01:02:41.324
You got somethin' to say to me?

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:43.159
Yeah, I do.

01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:45.595
You're suffering from a mild case
of heat exhaustion

01:02:45.695 --> 01:02:49.365
and a severe case of
"getting too old for this crap."

01:02:49.465 --> 01:02:51.968
So, give me the vest and your flares.

01:02:52.101 --> 01:02:54.103
- I'm goin' in.
- Is that it?

01:02:55.404 --> 01:02:56.212
That's it.

01:02:57.273 --> 01:03:01.688
Then why is the needle on my bullshit
detector still in the red?

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:07.116
I don't know. You got trust issues, man.

01:03:07.216 --> 01:03:09.924
Serious, you need therapy.
Just give me the vest.

01:03:12.388 --> 01:03:14.061
You got a signal on that phone, yet?

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:18.632
I have a bar.

01:03:22.565 --> 01:03:23.633
Trade?

01:03:23.733 --> 01:03:25.838
Really, you're gonna barter? Okay.

01:03:31.974 --> 01:03:33.715
Three, two, one.

01:03:40.683 --> 01:03:43.686
First sign of trouble, you pull the pin

01:03:43.786 --> 01:03:47.623
on this white phosphorus grenade
and you skedaddle.

01:03:47.723 --> 01:03:49.058
Comprende?

01:03:49.158 --> 01:03:50.501
Comprende.

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:54.198
I'll handle it from here.

01:03:58.234 --> 01:04:00.305
He's got a pair, I'll give him that.

01:05:06.669 --> 01:05:08.012
This is retarded.

01:05:13.042 --> 01:05:15.545
You're talking to me, so make it count.

01:05:15.645 --> 01:05:18.748
Mr. Bravers, Burt Gummer here.
I'm in a bit of pickle.

01:05:18.848 --> 01:05:21.551
Well, yeah. The bush can do that to you.

01:05:21.651 --> 01:05:22.652
So, how can I help, boet?

01:05:23.152 --> 01:05:25.132
I need a jerry can of gas and some ammo.

01:05:25.521 --> 01:05:28.001
Ah. Why the hell not? Where are you?

01:05:29.091 --> 01:05:33.496
About three clicks northwest of some
old railroad bridge, modified for road use.

01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:36.098
Ah, yeah, yeah. I know the spot.

01:05:36.198 --> 01:05:39.702
So, must I come heavy?

01:05:40.503 --> 01:05:41.537
Is there any other way?

01:05:41.637 --> 01:05:45.545
Well, I've got a couple of rocket pods
I took off a MiG-23 in the border war.

01:05:46.375 --> 01:05:47.443
It's too much?

01:05:47.543 --> 01:05:48.681
Just right.

01:06:36.192 --> 01:06:39.729
Come to Africa.
We'll have some laughs, see some game.

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:41.764
Go to a deep, dark, cavernous...

01:07:16.532 --> 01:07:18.011
Oh, my God.

01:07:28.544 --> 01:07:30.490
No. Not again!

01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:53.373
You are one ugly bitch.

01:08:08.284 --> 01:08:11.265
Suck on this!

01:08:23.198 --> 01:08:24.200
Whoa!

01:08:26.801 --> 01:08:27.870
Anything to report?

01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:30.814
Yeah. I think we hit the mother lode.

01:08:33.309 --> 01:08:34.510
What's happening, Baruti?

01:08:34.609 --> 01:08:36.045
I don't know.

01:08:36.145 --> 01:08:38.714
I mean, these creatures are supposed
to be nocturnal hunters.

01:08:38.814 --> 01:08:39.814
Why have they changed?

01:08:39.915 --> 01:08:43.051
Predators don't change their tactics
unless they are forced to do that.

01:08:43.152 --> 01:08:44.353
Something's triggered these attacks.

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:46.022
Animals always go for the food source.

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:48.466
No, I don't think it's that.
There are other reserves here.

01:08:49.425 --> 01:08:51.227
- So, they're targeting us.
- Yes.

01:08:51.327 --> 01:08:53.462
Make sure all of our weapons
are loaded and the truck is ready.

01:08:53.562 --> 01:08:54.596
We're going to the village.

01:08:54.697 --> 01:08:56.438
- Safety in numbers.
- Yeah.

01:08:58.701 --> 01:09:01.470
Those eggs have got themselves
the full protection package.

01:09:01.569 --> 01:09:02.810
So, we punt?

01:09:03.572 --> 01:09:05.051
Not so fast.

01:09:05.341 --> 01:09:07.981
Our protection package has just arrived!

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:12.523
There they are.

01:09:20.488 --> 01:09:22.332
Oh, no. Let's call it!

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:24.202
We pissed off the head worm?

01:09:47.515 --> 01:09:48.756
Shut it down.

01:09:58.727 --> 01:10:00.263
To the rocks, to the rocks!

01:10:06.769 --> 01:10:08.840
Come on, come on back!

01:10:10.239 --> 01:10:12.219
Hang on. Hang on.

01:10:21.217 --> 01:10:24.096
Come on. Come here.
Come back inside, man.

01:10:27.089 --> 01:10:28.227
Hold on!

01:10:41.704 --> 01:10:42.910
Charley?

01:10:44.373 --> 01:10:45.579
Charley?

01:11:00.155 --> 01:11:01.190
Charley?

01:11:02.224 --> 01:11:03.635
Charley!

01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:08.264
Charley?

01:12:16.498 --> 01:12:18.434
This is a bag of dicks.

01:12:18.534 --> 01:12:20.536
We're outta ammo
and we have to blow that cave.

01:12:20.669 --> 01:12:23.439
Come on, Gums. Don't lose faith.

01:12:23.539 --> 01:12:26.110
We are definitely F'ed up
beyond all recognition.

01:12:26.842 --> 01:12:28.177
But we are not out of ammo.

01:12:28.277 --> 01:12:31.451
All I got is this
damn pop gun, that's it.

01:12:32.247 --> 01:12:35.456
The bag is full, and it's ready to blow.

01:12:35.951 --> 01:12:37.225
Think outside the box.

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:46.495
- Oh, my God. You're right.
- Yeah.

01:12:46.595 --> 01:12:47.896
That'll scramble a few eggs.

01:12:47.996 --> 01:12:51.534
Oh, no. That'll make a big
frickin' omelet, is what that'll make.

01:12:51.667 --> 01:12:54.477
Now, how do we get to the chopper
without gettin' eaten alive?

01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:56.939
There's a herd of cattle out there.

01:12:57.039 --> 01:13:00.042
If we run with them, we can get lost
in their seismic signatures.

01:13:00.142 --> 01:13:02.884
What? That's your
brilliant idea, to run?

01:13:04.012 --> 01:13:07.357
"When the sun rises in Africa,
you better be running."

01:13:09.718 --> 01:13:11.020
You ready for this, old man?

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.360
You better step on it.

01:13:13.756 --> 01:13:14.791
Consider it stepped on.

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:27.513
Not too far, now.

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:32.346
Go, go, go, go!

01:13:38.881 --> 01:13:42.829
Out of my way, ladies.
Break it up, break it up.

01:13:52.861 --> 01:13:55.501
- You get to the helo.
- You lock it up.

01:14:01.503 --> 01:14:02.504
Whoo!

01:14:02.604 --> 01:14:03.706
Yeah!

01:14:03.806 --> 01:14:05.342
Easy, hoss. She'll be back.

01:14:06.008 --> 01:14:09.311
Right. Let's poach some eggs.

01:14:09.411 --> 01:14:11.347
- Scramble.
- My bad.

01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:15.384
Hello. These MiG pods hold 16 rockets each.
Looks like he loaded 10.

01:14:15.484 --> 01:14:17.119
This is gonna ring their bells.

01:14:17.219 --> 01:14:18.787
It's a bit of overkill, don't you think?

01:14:18.887 --> 01:14:20.764
If you're gonna give 'em the horn,
give 'em the horn.

01:14:23.959 --> 01:14:26.872
All right. All right,
enough of the '60s.

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:28.964
Hey, I like that song.

01:14:29.064 --> 01:14:31.033
Come on, where's the Tupac?

01:14:31.133 --> 01:14:34.269
Burt doesn't love the old hippy-dippy,
free-love stuff, does he?

01:14:34.369 --> 01:14:35.371
Takes me back.

01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:36.438
Back to where?

01:14:36.538 --> 01:14:38.484
Back before I met your sorry ass.

01:14:38.807 --> 01:14:40.377
Back to a gun show in Florida?

01:14:42.344 --> 01:14:43.448
What do you know about Florida?

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:46.588
We're burnin' daylight.

01:14:47.683 --> 01:14:50.664
All right. Laser designated.
Locked on target.

01:15:04.867 --> 01:15:07.040
Holy shit balls!

01:15:10.873 --> 01:15:12.352
Oh, yeah!

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:19.691
Psycho.

01:15:21.450 --> 01:15:23.118
What the hell? Jesus.

01:15:23.218 --> 01:15:24.953
What the hell?
I thought you were dead, man!

01:15:25.053 --> 01:15:28.000
Swallowed. Swallowed by that wide broad.

01:15:28.857 --> 01:15:33.203
She was about 10 meals ahead
and 20 craps behind.

01:15:36.298 --> 01:15:37.777
So, she spat me out.

01:15:39.101 --> 01:15:40.202
Spat you out?

01:15:40.302 --> 01:15:42.771
Well, I tickled the insides
of her belly a little bit.

01:15:42.871 --> 01:15:44.646
Been there, done that, my man.

01:15:46.808 --> 01:15:48.911
The bitch is back. Let's get outta here.

01:15:49.011 --> 01:15:50.012
Buckle up, boys.

01:15:50.112 --> 01:15:51.648
Come on, let's go.
Lock it up, lock it up.

01:16:20.042 --> 01:16:21.248
Okay, let's go.

01:16:25.147 --> 01:16:27.182
- Let's go.
- Come on, come on, come on.

01:16:27.282 --> 01:16:28.784
Come, come, come, come on.

01:16:29.952 --> 01:16:32.057
Stay close, Amahle. Stay close, okay?

01:16:36.658 --> 01:16:37.659
They're here.

01:16:38.827 --> 01:16:41.398
Okay. All we need to do
is get to your truck.

01:16:42.965 --> 01:16:44.069
Stay close.

01:16:46.835 --> 01:16:48.109
Again with the roof?

01:16:54.543 --> 01:16:55.544
Whoo!

01:16:55.944 --> 01:16:57.582
I like this badass Baruti.

01:17:02.351 --> 01:17:04.888
Come. Come, Amahle.
Come on, get in the back.

01:17:08.924 --> 01:17:09.925
Good girl.

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:26.308
Shit!

01:17:32.948 --> 01:17:34.894
It couldn't make it
through the concrete slab.

01:17:39.021 --> 01:17:40.022
Okay, it's turning around.

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:45.995
I've got an idea.

01:17:52.067 --> 01:17:53.637
All right. Stay here, baby, okay?

01:18:00.575 --> 01:18:02.213
Give me a light, give me a light.

01:18:03.812 --> 01:18:04.813
There you go. Thanks.

01:18:05.714 --> 01:18:06.715
Let's go.

01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:50.659
- Thanks for the gas.
- No worries, boet.

01:18:50.759 --> 01:18:54.429
Hey, look, I've gotta go
and fight a fire in Zululand,

01:18:54.529 --> 01:18:56.365
and my girl's running on fumes.

01:18:56.465 --> 01:18:59.235
- So, if you need me...
- I can reach you on the horn.

01:18:59.601 --> 01:19:00.739
Yebo.

01:19:01.636 --> 01:19:03.172
I've got a feeling
you're gonna be needing this.

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:07.079
An FN MAG. Classic.

01:19:07.275 --> 01:19:09.050
She packs a punch, that baby.

01:19:11.079 --> 01:19:12.848
She's all yours.

01:19:12.948 --> 01:19:14.723
Thanks. Boet.

01:19:19.755 --> 01:19:22.024
Always be running. Yeah.

01:19:22.124 --> 01:19:25.003
Never stop running, boet. Never!

01:19:30.932 --> 01:19:32.536
Let's talk about Florida.

01:19:33.235 --> 01:19:35.971
Sunshine State. Lotta ladies.

01:19:36.071 --> 01:19:38.840
I'm askin' what you know
about me and Florida.

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:41.276
I know that you went
to a Grateful Dead concert once

01:19:41.376 --> 01:19:42.411
when you were there.

01:19:42.511 --> 01:19:44.889
How could you possibly know that?
That was 40 years ago.

01:19:46.148 --> 01:19:47.855
Pretty sure I know who you went with.

01:19:58.293 --> 01:19:59.431
What do you know about Jasmine?

01:20:00.495 --> 01:20:03.635
Flower child meets heroin chic. Model.

01:20:04.766 --> 01:20:07.076
Hated disco. Loved Hendrix.

01:20:08.136 --> 01:20:11.379
You were selling your dad's old guns.
She was in the parking lot.

01:20:12.908 --> 01:20:13.875
Burning her bra.

01:20:13.975 --> 01:20:15.886
Far left meets far right.

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:18.018
They spend the night.

01:20:20.782 --> 01:20:22.056
Love's a bitch, huh, Burt?

01:20:23.451 --> 01:20:24.759
Who is she to you?

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:26.695
I call her "Mom" most of the time.

01:20:31.226 --> 01:20:32.227
Boom!

01:20:32.327 --> 01:20:34.273
Well, that's gotta stir up
some shit, right? Huh?

01:20:35.230 --> 01:20:37.165
You mean, you and me are...

01:20:37.265 --> 01:20:39.677
That's right. Bloodlines.

01:20:40.035 --> 01:20:41.742
Feel the theme happenin', here?

01:20:43.371 --> 01:20:44.606
- No.
- Yes.

01:20:44.706 --> 01:20:47.109
No. Impossible.

01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:48.844
You're tellin' me.

01:20:48.944 --> 01:20:51.652
I don't believe it.
There's no way you're my offspring.

01:20:52.881 --> 01:20:55.117
What? Well, that's a dick thing to say?

01:20:55.217 --> 01:20:56.321
What, do you think
you're better than me?

01:20:57.185 --> 01:21:00.598
I just don't... I mean... Crud.
Look at you!

01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:02.924
Yeah, look at me.

01:21:03.024 --> 01:21:04.960
How could I be the son of Burt Gummer?

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:06.698
A man of such towering importance.

01:21:08.163 --> 01:21:09.765
You know what? Forget it.

01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:12.000
We don't have to do
this whole Dr. Phil thing, okay?

01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:14.302
Let's just survive this
African worm invasion,

01:21:14.402 --> 01:21:16.643
and we'll go back to never speaking
to each other again. Cool?

01:21:16.972 --> 01:21:18.417
Son of a bitch!

01:21:20.475 --> 01:21:21.749
Let's get outta here.

01:21:23.812 --> 01:21:24.847
Let's boogie.

01:21:31.286 --> 01:21:32.321
Damn it!

01:21:34.389 --> 01:21:35.791
Grabber's got us hooked!

01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:37.370
You've got a gun. Use it.

01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:41.863
Yeah, dawg!

01:21:41.963 --> 01:21:44.307
I want a paternity test.

01:21:56.711 --> 01:21:57.679
What's this?

01:21:57.779 --> 01:21:58.951
I found it.

01:22:00.248 --> 01:22:01.983
- Amahle.
- What's going on?

01:22:02.083 --> 01:22:03.790
I think I know why we're under attack.

01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:18.166
Where would they go?

01:22:18.266 --> 01:22:19.643
The village.

01:22:21.603 --> 01:22:22.637
Safety in numbers.

01:22:22.737 --> 01:22:24.045
Let's go.

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:44.600
Stay in the car, baby, okay?

01:24:06.775 --> 01:24:07.981
Nandi!

01:24:22.557 --> 01:24:25.538
Come on. Come on! Let's go!

01:24:31.766 --> 01:24:34.436
Amahle? Amahle?

01:24:34.536 --> 01:24:35.637
Amahle?

01:24:35.737 --> 01:24:36.805
Amahle.

01:24:36.905 --> 01:24:38.673
- Amahle!
- Amahle!

01:24:38.773 --> 01:24:40.116
Mom!

01:25:01.129 --> 01:25:03.006
No seismic activity.

01:25:04.766 --> 01:25:07.610
Travis, look! Amahle, behind you!

01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:18.046
God, no! No, no.

01:25:18.146 --> 01:25:19.948
Off the ground and on the truck!

01:25:20.048 --> 01:25:22.117
- No, she's my child. No!
- Let's go.

01:25:22.484 --> 01:25:24.889
- It's gonna be okay, honey.
- It's okay. Wait right there.

01:25:25.286 --> 01:25:26.424
Go, go, go!

01:25:29.724 --> 01:25:31.962
- It's gonna be okay, honey.
- Hold on!

01:25:33.361 --> 01:25:34.562
Let me get a shot on it.

01:25:34.662 --> 01:25:36.431
No, no, no. We can't
risk hitting the girl.

01:25:36.531 --> 01:25:38.099
What does she have in that basket?

01:25:38.199 --> 01:25:39.701
I think she's got an Inkanyamba egg.

01:25:39.801 --> 01:25:42.937
- That egg is the last of the bloodline.
- Why do you say that?

01:25:43.037 --> 01:25:44.305
Because we blew up their nest.

01:25:44.405 --> 01:25:46.942
Look, we have a hostage situation.

01:25:47.876 --> 01:25:50.779
They're not gonna touch her
as long as she has the egg.

01:25:50.879 --> 01:25:52.947
- What's the worm count?
- One.

01:25:53.047 --> 01:25:55.027
And the queen bitch
is comin' for that egg.

01:25:56.985 --> 01:25:58.362
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

01:25:58.686 --> 01:26:00.256
- You see what I see?
- Yeah.

01:26:00.555 --> 01:26:04.292
Okay. One of us is gonna be bait
and one of us has gotta snatch the kid.

01:26:04.392 --> 01:26:06.394
- Who's it gonna be?
- I'll get her.

01:26:10.131 --> 01:26:12.270
- Hold on, baby.
- Let's go.

01:26:32.954 --> 01:26:33.989
Stand still!

01:26:55.777 --> 01:26:56.744
Baruti!

01:26:56.844 --> 01:26:58.755
Travis, here. Throw it!

01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:06.924
- It's okay. It's okay.
- You got her, you got her.

01:27:26.241 --> 01:27:27.242
Behind you!

01:27:34.582 --> 01:27:36.528
- I think I have an idea.
- Shoot.

01:27:37.218 --> 01:27:39.521
Amahle always uses her earthworm
zapper to catch worms.

01:27:39.621 --> 01:27:41.523
We can build one on a much larger scale.

01:27:41.623 --> 01:27:44.263
We have the worm.
What do you suggest we use for the zap?

01:27:45.526 --> 01:27:46.596
The lightning.

01:27:48.396 --> 01:27:51.309
We can use the pile rods from the drill rig
and wire them together.

01:27:52.767 --> 01:27:54.536
You can set your watch
to the lightning, right?

01:27:54.636 --> 01:27:56.571
Yes, and right now we've got 13 minutes.

01:27:56.671 --> 01:27:58.480
Let's hope the bride
doesn't get cold feet.

01:28:00.842 --> 01:28:01.843
What's goin' on?

01:28:01.943 --> 01:28:03.945
- Can you keep her busy?
- I can try.

01:28:04.045 --> 01:28:06.214
If we're lucky,
she'll follow your seismic signature.

01:28:06.314 --> 01:28:08.516
Send them to the river
and bring them back on my signal.

01:28:08.616 --> 01:28:10.562
- Your signal?
- I'll send up a flare.

01:28:29.103 --> 01:28:30.207
Give me some slack.

01:28:42.250 --> 01:28:43.388
Game on, Travis.

01:28:54.562 --> 01:28:56.269
Come on, tube snake!

01:29:03.204 --> 01:29:05.273
Come on. They're headed our way.

01:29:05.373 --> 01:29:06.613
Goodness, okay.

01:29:07.208 --> 01:29:08.209
Go, go, go, go!

01:29:09.911 --> 01:29:11.322
Come on, wherever you are.

01:29:13.614 --> 01:29:14.820
On the roof.

01:29:26.427 --> 01:29:27.701
Whoo!

01:29:29.263 --> 01:29:30.264
Sonny boy!

01:30:04.098 --> 01:30:05.441
Here it comes!

01:31:23.311 --> 01:31:25.518
It's over, baby. Come, let's go.

01:31:27.615 --> 01:31:29.060
I just got wormed.

01:32:07.655 --> 01:32:08.656
Hey.

01:32:10.091 --> 01:32:11.392
Here.

01:32:11.492 --> 01:32:13.127
Ooh. Yeah, no, I know this is Africa,

01:32:13.227 --> 01:32:15.296
but I'm not gonna eat
what I just killed.

01:32:15.396 --> 01:32:17.298
- Thank you.
- Okay.

01:32:17.398 --> 01:32:20.174
Well, Travis, I just wanted to say
thank you for everything.

01:32:21.102 --> 01:32:23.082
You're a good man. Deep down there.

01:32:23.337 --> 01:32:24.338
What, it's not on the surface?

01:32:25.806 --> 01:32:28.013
It rarely ever is.
You've gotta dig deep.

01:32:32.713 --> 01:32:33.714
See ya.

01:32:34.916 --> 01:32:36.020
Amahle!

01:32:50.398 --> 01:32:51.775
Good work today.

01:32:52.833 --> 01:32:53.903
Yeah.

01:32:54.869 --> 01:32:56.007
You, too.

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:01.751
So, what's the next stop
on the Burt train?

01:33:02.743 --> 01:33:04.950
More Who-The-Hell-Cares, Nevada?

01:33:05.846 --> 01:33:06.984
It's home.

01:33:09.450 --> 01:33:10.518
Where you goin'?

01:33:10.618 --> 01:33:11.653
I don't know.

01:33:13.321 --> 01:33:14.629
Probably back to Florida.

01:33:17.124 --> 01:33:19.900
Okay. You take care, you hear?

01:33:33.641 --> 01:33:34.642
Hey, wait a minute.

01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:37.578
What about my career?

01:33:37.678 --> 01:33:38.918
What about it?

01:33:39.213 --> 01:33:40.453
We had a deal.

01:33:41.382 --> 01:33:45.057
You said you were gonna take
the long view, build the Gummer brand.

01:33:45.987 --> 01:33:47.193
Said you were gonna fix me.

01:33:58.366 --> 01:34:00.107
You don't need fixin', Pops.

01:34:02.303 --> 01:34:05.182
Now, come on.
We got a gremlin to catch in Fresno.

01:34:06.907 --> 01:34:08.147
Pops.

01:34:45.146 --> 01:34:48.149
My name is Burt Gummer,
and I've been called many things.

01:34:48.249 --> 01:34:51.492
Gun enthusiast, monster-hunter,
doomsday-prepper.

01:34:51.852 --> 01:34:53.421
I reject all these labels.

01:34:53.521 --> 01:34:55.967
What I am is a survivalist.

01:34:56.490 --> 01:34:58.292
And I'm Travis B. Welker.

01:34:58.392 --> 01:35:01.729
I've been accused of being a ninja
photographer, an adrenaline junkie,

01:35:01.829 --> 01:35:03.864
and hitting on hot 22-year-olds.

01:35:03.964 --> 01:35:05.238
I'm guilty on all accounts.

01:35:05.499 --> 01:35:07.902
I embrace these labels,
and I live by them.

01:35:08.002 --> 01:35:13.174
And together, we're taking
on the bizarre, the deadly, the weird.

01:35:13.274 --> 01:35:14.878
It's a dirty job.

01:35:15.576 --> 01:35:16.987
But dirty guys are sexy.

01:35:18.746 --> 01:35:20.548
We've cracked the code of survival.

01:35:20.648 --> 01:35:24.622
We are the cure that ails anything
crittery, creepy or crawly.

01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:29.123
We are the knockout punch
to the shadowy world of monsters.

01:35:29.223 --> 01:35:30.668
Go, go, go!

01:35:32.293 --> 01:35:34.428
I don't know what the hell
you unleashed in there.

01:35:34.528 --> 01:35:36.163
So, if you need us
for anything that goes

01:35:36.263 --> 01:35:38.099
bang in the night
or fluff under your floor...

01:35:38.199 --> 01:35:39.600
- It's over here!
- Watch your back!

01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:40.701
Or just...

01:35:41.869 --> 01:35:43.337
...reach us on the horn.

01:35:43.437 --> 01:35:48.045
And remember, survival
and life starts here.
