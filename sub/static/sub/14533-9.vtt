I may have found my soulmate.

Gamby, she's passed out
drunk in the bathtub.

ain't gonna wake up.

You see the destruction
that she-beast laid?

risk-averse, considering.

No. I'm not proud of

01:26.250 --> 01:27.583
Well, you should be.

01:27.583 --> 01:29.375
'Cause this is how
leaders are made.

01:29.375 --> 01:33.375
Maybe so.
We gotta cover our tracks.

Almost a shame to get rid
of all this stuff, isn't it?

01:35.834 --> 01:38.959
Not really.
It's a relief.

There you go.
Look at that.

02:11.458 --> 02:13.875
You know, Charlemagne
may not be Shadowfax,

02:13.875 --> 02:15.708
but in time, you both
are gonna create

02:15.708 --> 02:17.917
your own unique friendship
that I would imagine

02:17.917 --> 02:19.708
is much stronger than
anything you could have had

And look, baby, if Charlemagne
is not into you riding her,

02:31.041 --> 02:32.208
just make her into you.

02:32.208 --> 02:34.542
Force yourself into her.

02:34.542 --> 02:37.375

telling her to do?

02:37.375 --> 02:40.875
Just mind your own
business, shit-shoveler.

How's it feel
to be back in the saddle?

02:46.291 --> 02:48.583

I kind of miss my bike.

02:48.583 --> 02:50.959

definition of a dumbass

different results.

02:55.583 --> 02:57.625

about what Ray said,

02:57.625 --> 02:59.166
about not being afraid.

02:59.166 --> 03:01.083
Baby, if you haven't
figured this out yet,

03:01.083 --> 03:03.458
Ray is a simple man, okay,
with simple thoughts.

03:03.458 --> 03:05.125
You, on the other hand,
are very smart.

03:05.125 --> 03:06.250
You're very talented.

I mean, you can do
any hobby you want.

Plus, isn't it really
expensive to do horses?

03:10.708 --> 03:13.041
I mean, you could
barely pay for Shadowfax.

03:13.041 --> 03:14.625
Oh, I don't know
who told you that,

03:14.625 --> 03:16.166

you back into the arms of Ray,

21:38.750 --> 21:41.708

shake my head,

21:41.708 --> 21:44.208
I want you
to pursue your dreams.

21:46.959 --> 21:48.792
You just gonna stand here
or are you gonna ride it?

21:48.792 --> 21:50.375
Not without a helmet.

21:50.375 --> 21:51.875

21:51.875 --> 21:53.208
Listen to your mom.
Seriously?

21:53.208 --> 21:55.041
Have to have a helmet.
Seriously.

21:58.583 --> 22:01.166
Oh my God,
they updated it.

22:02.208 --> 22:03.375
They updated it.

22:03.375 --> 22:04.708
Oh!

22:05.708 --> 22:07.375
Oh, they picked
the worst picture of me.

22:23.708 --> 22:25.041
I already told her
the good news.

22:25.041 --> 22:26.959
Did she lose her shit?
She didn't say anything.

22:26.959 --> 22:29.959
She just went in her room
and shut the door.
Been in there all day.

22:29.959 --> 22:31.208

But I gotta say, Gamby.

23:00.041 --> 23:03.333
None of this would be possible

You are a true

I didn't do everything.

23:08.917 --> 23:10.583
Yeah, but you did a lot.

23:10.583 --> 23:12.333
You did some
low-down dirty moves.

23:12.333 --> 23:15.417
Vandalizing the school,
burning her house down.

23:15.417 --> 23:16.333
Not just me.

Bonding with her
as a single parent.

23:17.875 --> 23:20.625

was her weakness and using
that gin against her?

Fine. Whatever.
Well, take it then.

Amanda, I just wanted

for the stuff I said to you
about you being less than me,

25:28.250 --> 25:30.583

25:30.583 --> 25:32.333
you being loose.
Loose?

25:32.333 --> 25:35.041
I just said that stuff
because I was jealous.

25:35.041 --> 25:38.458
I was insanely jealous
that a guy like Bill Hayden
got to be with you.

25:38.458 --> 25:43.041
Got to kiss you
and hold you
and lay naked next to you.

25:43.041 --> 25:46.500
Probably fondle and suck up
on your t--
Okay. Yup. I get it.

25:46.500 --> 25:48.708
Neal, you were jealous. Okay.

I'm trying to be better.

25:57.708 --> 25:59.625
Well, you come off

26:03.417 --> 26:04.708
Except me.

26:04.708 --> 26:06.583
I've seen a different you.

26:06.583 --> 26:09.917
I saw someone that I might
even like to be with.

26:09.917 --> 26:11.375
But now I'm confused.

26:11.375 --> 26:13.583
I don't know. Was
that a fluke moment?

26:13.583 --> 26:16.792
Or was that
the real you? I--

26:18.166 --> 26:20.583
Amanda, that wasn't a fluke.

26:20.583 --> 26:22.875
That was me,
the real me.

26:22.875 --> 26:24.583
And if you'll just
give me another shot,

26:24.583 --> 26:27.834
I promise, I'll show you
that side all the time.

26:27.834 --> 26:29.625
I just want to be with you.

26:29.625 --> 26:33.834
And as principal, I'll guarantee
that you never have to work

I'm over it.
I'm not jealous.

26:50.667 --> 26:52.417
I think you should fire him,
though, seriously.

26:52.417 --> 26:54.166
Okay, well, good,
because I wanted to.

26:54.166 --> 26:57.667
