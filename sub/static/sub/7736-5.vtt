that send to the union?

- I'll tell you what kind of signal.

you ten bucks in a restaurant.

Africa fighting off wildebeests

to remove my tray from the table?

how to be a good parent?

put some goddamn clothes on?

When Kevin comes back, we are
trying our new approach, OK?

07:25.930 --> 07:30.642
- I need you to back me up on this.
- Right, right. OK. Yes.

07:31.352 --> 07:33.229
- Kevin...
- I didn't do anything.

07:33.312 --> 07:35.931
Kevin, we know you've
been working extra hard in school

07:36.049 --> 07:40.570
and it paid off.
Son, you got a "C" in History!

07:40.652 --> 07:42.872
Yes! I knew I could excel.

07:43.531 --> 07:46.992
Um... It's very good.
We're proud of you.

07:47.076 --> 07:50.037

How'd you get tickets for that?
It's been sold out for weeks.

07:58.087 --> 08:01.006
Oh, it is? Frank, you have
some friends in your union

08:01.090 --> 08:03.217
that might have some
connections, don't you?

08:03.301 --> 08:06.053
Yeah, I do, but, uh, there's
a lot of tension between

08:06.054 --> 08:08.806
- both sides right now...
- They'd do anything for you.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.391
Kevin, consider it done.

08:10.475 --> 08:13.102
Your father is taking
you to that concert.

08:13.185 --> 08:14.645
Uh, yeah. I will.

08:14.728 --> 08:18.441
- Wow, thanks. That's really cool.
- Good job.

08:18.524 --> 08:22.194
Well, get used to it. There's more
brilliance where that came from.

Oh, wow, a whole day off

08:33.414 --> 08:36.125
- [gasping] What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

08:36.207 --> 08:37.835
I got seven hours to kill.

08:37.918 --> 08:40.171
I can't go home
and I don't have any money.

08:40.254 --> 08:43.029
I guess eat my lunch,
poop at the bowling alley,

08:43.041 --> 08:47.383
- and then wait.
- I'm so jealous! [bell rings]

08:47.803 --> 08:49.096
Enjoy your day!

08:49.763 --> 08:52.257
- Give me your sandwich.
- No!

Ooh, this is fun.

I hereby convene the first bargaining
session between Mohican Airways

and the International
Brotherhood of Baggage Handlers,

09:17.312 --> 09:20.878
Skycaps, Roadies and...
Circus Roustabouts.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.463
Are we ready to proceed?

09:22.547 --> 09:24.694
Frank Murphy, representing Mohican,

09:24.695 --> 09:28.553
- along with Senior Vice President Bob...
- Get this fucking show going!

09:28.636 --> 09:30.179
I think we're ready.

09:30.262 --> 09:33.140
The opening statement will be
given by the union's president,

09:33.224 --> 09:36.561
Louis "Snub-Nosed Louie" Gagliardi.

09:36.644 --> 09:39.605
Thank you for agreeing to
meet on the neutral territory

09:39.689 --> 09:43.025
of Captain Chucklecrust's
Family Fun Time Pizza Palace.

09:43.108 --> 09:46.257
Which, as of 3:30 a.m.,
the union happens to be the new

09:46.258 --> 09:49.407
owner of, and which,
I am pleased to announce,

09:49.490 --> 09:53.244
will become the finest adult cabaret
in the general airport district.

09:53.327 --> 09:55.162
<i>The Robot Bear Band will remain,</i>

09:55.246 --> 09:57.873
<i>but now they'll be doing
sex stuff with each other.</i>

09:57.956 --> 10:01.126
- I now cede the floor to my shop steward.
- Thank you.

10:01.210 --> 10:03.587
We have four days to reach a contract,

10:03.588 --> 10:05.964
and our union will
bargain in good faith.

10:06.048 --> 10:10.344
But we will not be pushed around.
We will fight for our dignity!

10:10.428 --> 10:14.599
- Like Dr. King, we too have a dream!
- Well said.

10:14.682 --> 10:17.101
You've asked for an
increase in your wage.

10:17.184 --> 10:21.230
Our CEO, Mr. Dunbarton, has
instructed me to make this offer,

10:21.313 --> 10:24.275
which I hope you'll seriously consider.

10:25.670 --> 10:27.569

10:34.702 --> 10:37.037
Great work, Sue. Just great.

10:37.121 --> 10:40.291
Hey, thanks. Thank you.
It was a tough week, but it's...

10:40.374 --> 10:42.460
Yeah, I still need you
to run some butter tubs

10:42.543 --> 10:44.462
out to Ryetown for Julie today.

10:44.545 --> 10:46.130
Oh, no, no, no,
I just saw her yesterday.

10:46.213 --> 10:49.841
I know. She's a pack rat.
Good for business.

10:49.925 --> 10:54.430
Can you do that for me?
Is it convenient for you? Thanks.

10:54.513 --> 10:56.307
No, it's not convenient for me.

10:56.390 --> 10:59.268
But you don't care, do you?
You bossy bitch!

10:59.351 --> 11:01.687
[slow guitar music plays]

11:10.862 --> 11:12.906
[bowling pins clattering nearby]

11:28.506 --> 11:31.383
It's true we've proposed eliminating

11:31.384 --> 11:34.950
a small number of baggage
handler jobs, but that's

11:34.951 --> 11:38.516
because automation is coming
whether we like it or not.

11:38.599 --> 11:41.143
And we must embrace innovation.

11:41.226 --> 11:43.437
Take this pizza, for instance.

11:43.521 --> 11:47.065
Why does the cheese stop at
the crust? I like the crust.

11:47.149 --> 11:50.152
But it's so much fun
getting to the crust.

22:04.975 --> 22:06.726
- Lick these batteries.
- No.

22:06.810 --> 22:08.378
Billy, you better do what I say

22:08.379 --> 22:10.730
or I tell Mom and Dad
about your suspension.

22:10.814 --> 22:12.565
Tell 'em. See if I care.

22:12.649 --> 22:14.359
<i>I'm not afraid of you, Sickle.</i>

22:14.443 --> 22:16.861
Come on. Do what I say, you pussy!

22:16.945 --> 22:19.156
I am not a pussy!

Where are you going?

22:28.123 --> 22:31.117
Heya, Billy. Filled

22:32.461 --> 22:35.255
Come back here, you're going crazy!

23:00.905 --> 23:04.784
Me, too!
But first, Shire of Frodo.

23:05.827 --> 23:08.621
S.O.F. rules!

23:08.705 --> 23:13.835
Long ago, in a mystical
realm known as Forest-veld,

23:13.918 --> 23:17.922
lived a tribe of gnomes
known as the Wonderfolk.

23:18.006 --> 23:20.217
[crowd booing]

23:21.550 --> 23:25.763

23:29.184 --> 23:32.020
What are you doing?
You're not even giving them a chance!

23:32.103 --> 23:34.356
No more throwing shite. Right?

23:34.439 --> 23:38.776

[sobbing] Peppino!

26:18.478 --> 26:19.770
Thanks for the tickets.

26:19.854 --> 26:22.524
Even if they only played the
intro to the interlude to one song,

26:22.607 --> 26:24.359
it was still pretty
cool of you to take me.

26:24.442 --> 26:26.528
Eh, we're not assholes all the time.

26:26.611 --> 26:28.154
What got into you guys tonight?

26:28.238 --> 26:30.574
You're all, like, happy.
It's freaking me out.

26:32.576 --> 26:34.619
Oh, that's one of ours, Kevin.

26:34.703 --> 26:36.538
Did I ever tell you
I wanted to be a pilot?

26:36.621 --> 26:38.582
I even got accepted to flight school.

26:38.665 --> 26:41.710
- He did.
- Cool. Why didn't you go?

26:41.792 --> 26:44.921
I met your mom, and then, uh...
you came along.

26:45.004 --> 26:47.756
Plans changed and we
started a family instead.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.967
We've had our ups and
downs, sometimes we

26:49.968 --> 26:52.095
haven't gotten along,
but it's moments like this

26:52.096 --> 26:55.515
when I know I wouldn't trade
what I have right now...

26:55.599 --> 26:56.891
Fuck!

man with the hook. He got killed-ed.

a baby with the lady</i>

27:21.979 --> 27:24.835
- who looks like my mom.
- Thanks, sport.

27:26.296 --> 27:28.631
And then he laid down on top of her,

27:28.632 --> 27:30.967
and they wrassled. I think he won.

27:31.050 --> 27:33.928
But he was making noises
like he was losing.

27:34.011 --> 27:36.576
And then a man on a surfboard asked me

27:36.577 --> 27:39.142
<i>if I was tired of the
same old toothpaste.</i>

27:39.225 --> 27:45.398
<i>[sniffs] Then a talking dog told me
to help stomp out childhood rickets,</i>

27:45.482 --> 27:48.485
<i>and then Luger man
came back and he said,</i>

27:48.568 --> 27:51.446
<i>"Here's scenes from next week."</i>

27:51.529 --> 27:55.199
<i>They showed them scenes.
They's pretty good.</i>

27:55.283 --> 27:58.536
<i>[sniffs] In one of 'em,
he was punching a lady-man.</i>

27:58.620 --> 28:01.331
<i>Then a suit-wearing man came on to say</i>

<i>there's some big fire
in the woods somewheres</i>

28:05.001 --> 28:07.962
<i>and that there'd be film of it at 11.</i>
