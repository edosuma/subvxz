WEBVTT

00:00.999 --> 00:03.136
My name is Ichabod Crane.

00:03.537 --> 00:07.306
In 1781, I died on the battlefield,

00:08.511 --> 00:11.575
Now I've been awakened 250 years later

00:11.576 --> 00:14.427
in a land I no longer recognize...

00:14.428 --> 00:15.549
Sleepy Hollow.

00:19.773 --> 00:21.324
You were called to defend humanity

00:21.325 --> 00:24.300
from the forces of hell... we both were.

00:25.608 --> 00:27.688
We need to fight with every
breath that we have left.

00:29.636 --> 00:32.147
I have faced horsemen without heads.

00:32.148 --> 00:34.965
Even discovered my own
son is the horseman of war.

00:34.966 --> 00:37.654
Let us release our own horseman.

00:39.966 --> 00:43.908
They've been planning this since
before the birth of our nation.

00:44.997 --> 00:48.834
What are we willing to
do to keep everyone safe?

00:51.198 --> 00:53.778
War isn't coming to Sleepy Hollow.

00:53.779 --> 00:56.551
It's been here waiting all along.

00:56.552 --> 00:57.812
Good-bye, Father.

00:57.813 --> 00:59.013
No! No!

01:02.612 --> 01:04.212
Lieutenant?

01:06.182 --> 01:08.383
Lieutenant, please.

01:11.187 --> 01:13.388
Anyone?

01:17.926 --> 01:19.126
Surprise.

01:21.430 --> 01:22.530
It's a surprise party.

01:23.599 --> 01:24.765
I got you.

01:24.766 --> 01:26.667
A surprise party.

01:26.668 --> 01:28.502
And why must your era

01:28.503 --> 01:30.605
celebrate terror with dessert?

01:30.606 --> 01:32.773
I'm sorry I couldn't
find a cupcake big enough

01:32.774 --> 01:37.812
for 251 candles.

01:38.714 --> 01:39.981
Happy Birthday.

01:39.982 --> 01:41.215
Well, then...

01:41.216 --> 01:43.818
I shall consider myself "punk'd."

01:44.953 --> 01:47.455
Well, what? Do we just stare at it?

01:47.456 --> 01:48.689
You blow it out.

01:48.690 --> 01:51.158
- Make a wish.
- Oh, a wish?

01:51.159 --> 01:53.127
- Another modern tradition.
- And here I thought

01:53.128 --> 01:55.896
science had won over
superstition in modern America.

01:56.965 --> 01:58.933
Very well, a wish.

02:00.569 --> 02:02.503
- I wish...
- Not out loud.

02:02.504 --> 02:05.373
Is there no end to this birthday madness?

02:05.374 --> 02:06.641
Just wish for something good.

02:06.642 --> 02:08.876
Given everything we've been through,

02:08.877 --> 02:11.212
we could use a little celebrating.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:22.257 --> 02:23.991
Revenge won't bring them back.

02:23.992 --> 02:26.093
No, but it will be

02:26.094 --> 02:27.928
eminently satisfying.

02:29.364 --> 02:31.265
It's been almost a year.

02:31.266 --> 02:33.701
The future is perilous enough.

02:33.702 --> 02:36.203
I'd rather not discuss the past, thank you.

02:36.204 --> 02:37.538
Today of all days.

02:37.539 --> 02:39.039
We keep avoiding it.

02:40.008 --> 02:42.777
We avoid it because it is hard.

02:42.778 --> 02:44.879
It is hard to believe.

02:44.880 --> 02:47.248
It is even harder to accept.

02:48.617 --> 02:51.185
We both lost someone we loved.

02:51.186 --> 02:54.054
Let us leave it at that.

02:55.424 --> 02:57.825
I just...

03:01.263 --> 03:03.798
I don't think I would've
made it without you, Crane.

03:03.799 --> 03:06.300
Nor I you, Lieutenant.

03:16.084 --> 03:17.138
_

03:17.245 --> 03:19.747
Mills.

03:21.616 --> 03:24.051
All right, we'll be right there.

03:24.052 --> 03:25.753
Party's over.

03:25.754 --> 03:27.521
Thank God.

03:30.331 --> 03:32.493
The sheriff's department didn't say why

03:32.494 --> 03:34.160
this fellow requested our presence?

03:34.161 --> 03:35.830
Only that he's the attending professor

03:35.831 --> 03:37.431
at the Historical Society.

03:37.432 --> 03:38.933
Couldn't wait.

03:38.934 --> 03:40.601
He had something to show us,

03:40.602 --> 03:41.936
thought he might be in danger.

03:41.937 --> 03:43.504
And he specifically summoned us?

03:43.505 --> 03:44.605
Yep.

03:44.606 --> 03:46.807
Well, that's never good.

03:49.411 --> 03:51.545
The Horseman.

03:52.914 --> 03:54.949
He's back.

04:01.656 --> 04:03.457
This is what we've been
training for. You ready?

04:03.458 --> 04:06.694
I've been ready for 200 years.

04:19.641 --> 04:20.874
Clear.

04:32.354 --> 04:34.555
We're too late.

04:36.792 --> 04:38.425
Professor.

04:44.733 --> 04:46.300
"First Among Founders:

04:46.301 --> 04:48.135
"Benjamin Franklin's Impact

04:48.136 --> 04:50.371
on Colonial America."

04:50.372 --> 04:52.406
"Impact"?

04:52.407 --> 04:54.175
On the scores of strumpets

04:54.176 --> 04:56.310
he crushed beneath his girth, perhaps.

04:56.311 --> 04:57.678
I take it you knew Franklin.

04:57.679 --> 04:59.013
I was his apprentice.

04:59.014 --> 05:00.648
Under General Washington's insistence.

05:00.649 --> 05:03.217
The man was insufferable.

05:03.218 --> 05:05.219
We are talking about Benjamin Franklin?

05:05.220 --> 05:07.988
The editor of the
Declaration of Independence?

05:07.989 --> 05:10.491
Blowhard, braggart, blatherskite

05:10.492 --> 05:11.907
and gasbag.

05:11.908 --> 05:13.751
He had an insatiable need to prove

05:13.752 --> 05:15.251
he was the sharpest intellect in the room.

05:15.252 --> 05:17.731
Could see how that would be hard for you.

05:23.438 --> 05:25.583
The Horseman was looking for something.

05:25.584 --> 05:27.775
Why would he want a
history professor's research

05:27.776 --> 05:29.309
on Benjamin Franklin?

05:30.679 --> 05:34.381
Any student of Franklin's

05:34.382 --> 05:36.383
would be as shrewd and conniving

05:36.384 --> 05:38.152
as the man himself.

05:39.287 --> 05:40.554
Ah.

05:45.093 --> 05:46.260
"Diligence

05:46.261 --> 05:49.196
is the mother of good luck."

05:49.197 --> 05:52.533
And we could use a
little of that right now.

05:52.534 --> 05:54.001
Crane, down!

06:01.376 --> 06:03.410
Consecrated rounds!

06:10.452 --> 06:11.819
I'm all out.

06:11.820 --> 06:13.320
Kali's arrows.

06:28.770 --> 06:30.604
Lieutenant!

06:41.683 --> 06:43.417
He dies tonight.

06:43.418 --> 06:45.185
- Crane!
- He pays for what he took.

06:45.186 --> 06:46.420
We can't. Look at me.

06:46.421 --> 06:48.689
He killed my wife!

06:49.691 --> 06:51.692
And my sister.

06:53.328 --> 06:54.962
We are low on ammo.

06:54.963 --> 06:56.263
He was here for a reason.

06:56.264 --> 06:58.365
We stay on mission.

07:02.103 --> 07:03.270
You okay?

07:03.271 --> 07:04.905
Yes.

07:05.941 --> 07:08.342
We have what he came for.

07:08.343 --> 07:10.811
Now we find out why.

07:12.814 --> 07:15.282
And these documents are
from Franklin libraries

07:15.283 --> 07:17.051
around the country.

07:17.052 --> 07:20.154
Albany, Boston, Philadelphia.

07:20.155 --> 07:22.389
What have we here? Boston.

07:23.491 --> 07:24.858
These notes say he found

07:24.859 --> 07:26.794
a charcoal key rubbing in the archives

07:26.795 --> 07:28.896
at Harvard University.

07:28.897 --> 07:30.998
That place still exists?

07:40.642 --> 07:42.176
I know this key.

07:49.017 --> 07:51.218
Franklin requested my help

07:51.219 --> 07:53.387
with his experiments on electricity.

07:53.388 --> 07:56.657
You were there when he was out in the storm

07:56.658 --> 07:58.158
flying a kite?

07:58.159 --> 07:59.860
Of course. I was his apprentice.

07:59.861 --> 08:01.662
He had just returned from England,

08:01.663 --> 08:03.364
where he claimed to have infiltrated

08:03.365 --> 08:06.033
a secret society known
as the Hellfire Club.

08:06.034 --> 08:08.035
They were fixated on defeating

08:08.036 --> 08:09.403
America's quest for freedom.

08:09.404 --> 08:11.171
And, as was typical

08:11.172 --> 08:13.507
of our Founding Father,

08:13.508 --> 08:16.944
I found him unabashedly exposed.

08:21.383 --> 08:22.418
Crane!

08:22.419 --> 08:25.386
Just getting in a little air bath

08:25.387 --> 08:26.620
before the end of the day.

08:26.621 --> 08:28.355
Very good.

08:28.356 --> 08:30.457
Don't be such a prude, Ichabod.

08:32.027 --> 08:34.760
Clearly they never taught you
how to tie a knot at Oxford.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.230
Well, I suppose I should have spent

08:36.231 --> 08:37.931
more time studying the Hellfire Club.

08:37.932 --> 08:40.833
Study Washington, Jefferson, Adams and me.

08:41.970 --> 08:44.038
You're one of us now.

08:44.039 --> 08:45.606
An American.

08:46.842 --> 08:49.076
There's a storm coming to our shores, lad.

08:49.077 --> 08:50.944
We must be prepared to weather it.

08:54.482 --> 08:56.250
Sir, please!

08:56.251 --> 08:57.584
We must go back inside!

08:57.585 --> 08:58.652
Not yet!

08:58.653 --> 09:01.855
Not till this key is struck.

09:04.759 --> 09:06.627
What's wrong?

09:06.628 --> 09:08.328
It failed.

09:08.329 --> 09:10.330
This key cannot be destroyed.

09:10.331 --> 09:11.732
I don't follow, sir.

09:11.733 --> 09:13.500
I was hoping the fire from the heavens

09:13.501 --> 09:14.668
might neutralize it,

09:14.669 --> 09:16.270
but it's no use.

09:16.271 --> 09:18.238
It must be secreted away.

09:18.239 --> 09:19.873
Far from evil's grasp.

09:20.742 --> 09:22.176
So, his experiments had nothing

09:22.177 --> 09:23.277
to do with electricity.

09:23.278 --> 09:24.611
Indeed.

09:24.612 --> 09:27.114
He was trying to destroy this key.

09:27.115 --> 09:28.682
But why?

09:28.683 --> 09:31.085
The professor's notes refer to it

09:31.086 --> 09:32.986
as the "Gehenna key."

09:32.987 --> 09:34.655
What?

09:35.657 --> 09:36.924
"Gehenna."

09:36.925 --> 09:38.663
It's the name for the realm

09:38.664 --> 09:41.095
between life and death.

09:41.096 --> 09:43.463
Also known as purgatory.

09:47.936 --> 09:49.603
The one rule of purgatory:

09:49.604 --> 09:51.939
A soul cannot leave unless
another takes its place.

09:51.940 --> 09:53.941
- Right.
- Wrong.

09:53.942 --> 09:57.511
- This key can break that rule.
- A loophole.

09:57.512 --> 09:59.780
A way to release souls
trapped in purgatory.

09:59.781 --> 10:01.548
Would've been nice to have a year ago.

10:04.786 --> 10:06.720
Crane, you know what this means?

10:07.555 --> 10:10.457
This key can let anyone

10:10.458 --> 10:12.993
or anything out.

10:13.995 --> 10:15.295
Moloch.

10:15.296 --> 10:17.131
Of course.

10:17.132 --> 10:18.632
He's the guardian of purgatory.

10:18.633 --> 10:20.400
Therefore, he is bound by the same laws.

10:20.401 --> 10:21.902
Lieutenant,

10:21.903 --> 10:24.371
if he discovers this key,

10:24.372 --> 10:27.441
everything we've sacrificed
will be for naught.

10:37.085 --> 10:38.852
We've combed through the professor's notes.

10:38.853 --> 10:40.587
I've gone through Corbin's files,

10:40.588 --> 10:41.989
everything in the archives.

10:41.990 --> 10:44.158
There's nothing left about the...

10:44.159 --> 10:45.425
location of this key.

10:45.426 --> 10:47.327
We're out of leads.

10:47.328 --> 10:49.563
There's one option left.

10:49.564 --> 10:52.432
I loathe even considering it.

10:53.434 --> 10:55.369
You want to talk to your son?

10:55.370 --> 10:58.205
If the Horseman is searching for a key

10:58.206 --> 11:00.007
to open a door to purgatory,

11:00.008 --> 11:01.273
Henry may be the only one

11:01.274 --> 11:03.076
who can tell us where it might be.

11:03.077 --> 11:05.946
Assuming he'll tell us the truth.

11:07.182 --> 11:09.116
He's a mastermind, Crane.

11:09.117 --> 11:11.351
And the freaking Horseman of War.

11:11.352 --> 11:12.786
I'm aware of the dangers.

11:12.787 --> 11:14.054
He will try to prey

11:14.055 --> 11:15.189
on our vulnerabilities.

11:15.190 --> 11:17.925
But we will not let him.

11:17.926 --> 11:19.459
We cannot.

11:19.460 --> 11:21.595
He is our prisoner.

11:22.597 --> 11:24.798
You're right.

11:25.934 --> 11:28.335
I hate this.

11:29.304 --> 11:30.971
Let's talk to him.

11:34.776 --> 11:36.243
Ah, the prophesied Witnesses

11:36.244 --> 11:37.945
have come to grace me with their presence.

11:37.946 --> 11:40.080
Hello, Father.

11:42.283 --> 11:44.918
What have you brought me this time?

11:44.919 --> 11:47.487
These belonged to a history professor.

11:47.488 --> 11:49.923
We need to know if they hold
any secrets about the location

11:49.924 --> 11:52.125
of a key that belonged to Ben Franklin.

11:52.126 --> 11:54.061
What I meant was...

11:54.062 --> 11:55.762
what have you brought me?

11:58.600 --> 11:59.800
Oh...

12:03.171 --> 12:05.772
Magnificent.

12:09.677 --> 12:10.944
Funny, isn't it?

12:10.945 --> 12:12.913
These plants have no idea

12:12.914 --> 12:14.781
that their sunlight isn't real,

12:14.782 --> 12:17.584
yet they bloom nonetheless.

12:17.585 --> 12:19.920
A testament to the fact

12:19.921 --> 12:23.723
that anything can be
tricked into believing a lie.

12:41.609 --> 12:44.044
These documents reveal nothing.

12:45.813 --> 12:47.047
I taste no sin.

12:47.048 --> 12:48.649
Not even a fib.

12:48.650 --> 12:50.617
That drawing was from the Hellfire Club,

12:50.618 --> 12:53.020
the den of sin.

12:53.021 --> 12:54.488
Do you have any other papers?

12:54.489 --> 12:57.357
Perhaps from your mentor, Sheriff Corbin.

12:57.358 --> 13:01.461
He collected files on the supernatural.

13:01.462 --> 13:02.796
Nothing about the key.

13:02.797 --> 13:04.197
Are you sure?

13:04.198 --> 13:06.466
Give me your hand.

13:06.467 --> 13:08.235
Shall I read your sins?

13:08.236 --> 13:11.638
See if you're suppressing any memories?

13:11.639 --> 13:13.337
Sins of omission?

13:13.338 --> 13:15.008
You want me to let you read my sins?

13:15.009 --> 13:16.310
This is absurd.

13:16.311 --> 13:18.712
It's in the interest of the case.

13:18.713 --> 13:21.014
You do want to find the key, don't you?

13:21.883 --> 13:23.850
Crane, a minute alone.

13:38.499 --> 13:39.666
Jenny.

13:39.667 --> 13:41.668
Pardon?

13:41.669 --> 13:44.438
When he mentioned Corbin, I remembered.

13:44.439 --> 13:47.107
She told me Corbin had
her go to Philadelphia

13:47.108 --> 13:49.543
to acquire an important sketchbook

13:49.544 --> 13:50.944
that belonged to Franklin.

13:50.945 --> 13:52.679
Did she tell you where it is?

13:52.680 --> 13:55.582
No. I've never actually seen it.

13:55.583 --> 13:58.652
Then it is a secret she took to her grave.

14:06.027 --> 14:08.195
You all right?

14:08.196 --> 14:10.697
This is the strangest sensation.

14:10.698 --> 14:12.466
All of our experiences,

14:12.467 --> 14:14.701
all of our training over the past year...

14:14.702 --> 14:17.270
I know they happened,

14:17.271 --> 14:19.506
but I can recall no detail.

14:21.309 --> 14:23.643
It's as if my memory...

14:23.644 --> 14:27.147
blurs...

14:27.148 --> 14:29.683
from the day Henry betrayed us.

14:30.818 --> 14:32.152
Good-bye, Father.

14:32.153 --> 14:34.154
No! No!

14:34.155 --> 14:37.324
How did we capture him?

14:38.960 --> 14:40.827
I don't remember.

14:42.730 --> 14:46.233
Moloch brought you here
for one final mission,

14:46.234 --> 14:49.970
to tell me where to find Franklin's key.

14:49.971 --> 14:51.738
And now I know.

14:51.739 --> 14:54.174
With your sister Jenny.

14:54.175 --> 14:56.109
Jenny's still alive.

14:56.110 --> 14:58.011
We're still in purgatory.

14:58.012 --> 15:00.580
It's all a trick!

15:00.581 --> 15:02.549
You want out?

15:08.456 --> 15:11.758
The illusion has been shattered.

15:11.759 --> 15:14.294
Abigail will remain in purgatory,

15:14.295 --> 15:17.764
and you will suffocate

15:17.765 --> 15:20.767
in that plain pine box I buried you in,

15:20.768 --> 15:22.536
back on Earth.

15:22.537 --> 15:25.739
Whilst I... retrieve the key.

15:27.775 --> 15:28.809
Crane!

15:28.810 --> 15:30.143
You have to get out

15:30.144 --> 15:31.711
of that coffin, find Jenny

15:31.712 --> 15:33.213
and find the key.

15:33.214 --> 15:35.115
I'll try to stop Moloch from here.

15:35.116 --> 15:38.084
I promise you! I will return for you!

15:40.888 --> 15:42.389
Crane!

16:10.540 --> 16:12.741
Henry.

16:12.768 --> 16:14.035
How did I get here?

16:14.036 --> 16:15.502
Jennifer Mills.

16:15.503 --> 16:17.704
Don't you remember?

16:25.113 --> 16:28.849
Just so you know, my
father and your sister...

16:28.850 --> 16:30.183
all gone.

16:30.184 --> 16:32.552
No.

16:32.553 --> 16:33.854
Abbie said...

16:33.855 --> 16:35.622
"Abbie said"? You sound like a child.

16:35.623 --> 16:38.625
She used you,

16:38.626 --> 16:41.261
and she left your carcass to me.

16:41.262 --> 16:43.196
Always a predator, that one,

16:43.197 --> 16:44.231
like your Sheriff Corbin.

16:44.232 --> 16:45.532
He sent you to Philadelphia

16:45.533 --> 16:48.402
five years ago to acquire a sketchbook

16:48.403 --> 16:51.405
that was created during
the American Revolution.

16:51.406 --> 16:53.307
In the pages of

16:53.308 --> 16:55.142
that book was a drawing.

16:55.143 --> 16:56.777
Of a key.

16:56.778 --> 16:58.946
I don't know what you're talking about.

16:58.947 --> 17:01.315
There's no use hiding the truth from me.

17:01.316 --> 17:04.417
I am a Sin Eater.

17:04.419 --> 17:06.386
I can taste your lie.

17:06.387 --> 17:08.922
You don't have to tell me.

17:08.923 --> 17:10.824
Your sins will speak for themselves.

17:12.393 --> 17:14.661
I've done a lot of sinning.

17:14.662 --> 17:17.196
I hope you choke on every one of 'em.

17:30.645 --> 17:34.365
_

17:34.999 --> 17:36.858
_

17:39.343 --> 17:40.220
_

17:40.264 --> 17:42.127
_

17:46.260 --> 17:48.662
War is hell.

18:25.333 --> 18:26.933
Sulfur.

18:37.845 --> 18:40.347
She's finally yours, Abraham.

18:40.348 --> 18:42.082
Don't you dare...

18:42.083 --> 18:43.083
No!

18:44.419 --> 18:45.752
Katrina!

18:56.230 --> 18:58.632
I am not afraid of you.

20:12.840 --> 20:14.808
Shh.

20:24.418 --> 20:27.821
You need to get to someplace
safe before Moloch finds you.

20:27.822 --> 20:30.590
Last time I saw you, Brooks, you were dead.

20:30.591 --> 20:32.625
Sorry if I don't take your safety advice.

20:33.528 --> 20:35.262
Have fun in hell.

20:35.263 --> 20:37.030
It's purgatory,

20:37.031 --> 20:39.724
not hell, which means you still
have a chance of getting out of here,

20:39.725 --> 20:41.634
but only if you listen.

20:58.553 --> 21:00.787
Tell me, what is he doing?

21:00.788 --> 21:02.655
Preparing to enter the earthly realm.

21:05.059 --> 21:06.326
He's creating a demon army

21:06.327 --> 21:07.460
to bring with him.

21:07.461 --> 21:09.229
A demon army?

21:11.732 --> 21:13.166
That's why Moloch needs the key.

21:13.167 --> 21:14.701
Every tortured soul

21:14.702 --> 21:16.469
in purgatory, fighting for the End of Days.

21:16.470 --> 21:19.072
Unless I can help you
stop this from happening.

21:19.073 --> 21:20.707
You want to help me?

21:20.708 --> 21:22.842
I need to warn Crane.

21:22.843 --> 21:24.544
Katrina found some way

21:24.545 --> 21:27.180
to communicate with us
when she was down here.

21:27.181 --> 21:29.216
If you know how she did it, show me.

21:29.217 --> 21:31.084
Come on.

21:34.322 --> 21:36.656
And if I do not survive,

21:36.657 --> 21:39.392
I want you to know, Lieutenant,

21:39.393 --> 21:41.227
I never stopped fighting.

21:44.065 --> 21:45.999
And... none of that recorded.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.434
Wonderful.

22:01.415 --> 22:03.083
It's rudimentary,

22:03.084 --> 22:04.717
but it is gunpowder.

22:13.394 --> 22:15.128
Hear, hear

22:15.129 --> 22:17.797
for fire and brimstone.

23:23.740 --> 23:26.142
Trapped in the export
warehouse off Route 9.

23:26.143 --> 23:28.010
Working on a way out.

23:47.264 --> 23:49.265
This is Moloch's lair.

23:49.266 --> 23:52.668
It's where Katrina came.

23:52.669 --> 23:55.004
She'd wait for him to
leave, then sneak inside.

23:55.005 --> 23:57.006
What's in there?

23:57.007 --> 23:58.274
A mirror.

23:58.275 --> 23:59.731
Capable of reflecting a path

23:59.732 --> 24:01.344
to the outside world.

24:02.246 --> 24:04.413
It's how she found you...

24:04.414 --> 24:07.950
and Crane.

24:07.951 --> 24:10.453
And how Moloch found you, too.

24:12.923 --> 24:14.631
Just recite the incantation on the stone

24:14.632 --> 24:16.633
beneath the mirrors, then say Crane's name.

24:16.634 --> 24:19.903
So it's like a demon hologram
is basically what you're saying?

24:21.339 --> 24:23.006
I got to go.

24:23.007 --> 24:24.507
And I won't be here when you come out.

24:24.508 --> 24:26.243
What do you mean?

24:26.244 --> 24:28.712
Moloch would tear me to pieces if he knew.

24:28.713 --> 24:30.313
But I needed to know

24:30.314 --> 24:33.049
that I still have some
trace of free will left.

24:34.418 --> 24:37.620
You remind me that I am human.

25:26.704 --> 25:28.917
Madam. Care for a lift?

25:28.918 --> 25:30.273
Where's Abbie?

25:30.274 --> 25:32.008
Purgatory.

25:35.746 --> 25:38.214
Step on it, Crane! Reverse!

25:38.215 --> 25:39.382
You don't know how to reverse.

25:39.383 --> 25:41.484
- No! I do...
- Move!

25:43.488 --> 25:46.323
Must learn to drive.

25:46.324 --> 25:49.159
Hold on.

25:54.732 --> 25:56.833
Holy hell, Crane. This is really happening.

25:56.834 --> 26:00.003
As usual, the impossible
becomes our reality.

26:00.004 --> 26:02.238
If it's any consolation, in purgatory,

26:02.239 --> 26:04.674
we were led to believe you were dead.

26:04.675 --> 26:07.110
Well, I'm glad that
illusion's been crushed.

26:07.111 --> 26:09.212
Though you did miss my birthday party.

26:10.948 --> 26:12.420
Abbie's still trapped there, isn't she?

26:12.421 --> 26:13.978
Let's get to the ley lines and get her out.

26:13.979 --> 26:16.086
A living soul cannot exit purgatory

26:16.087 --> 26:17.520
unless another takes its place.

26:17.521 --> 26:19.122
Who left with you?

26:19.123 --> 26:21.157
Katrina.

26:21.158 --> 26:23.693
After 200 years, she is finally

26:23.694 --> 26:26.029
out of purgatory only to be

26:26.030 --> 26:27.630
captured by the Horseman of Death.

26:27.631 --> 26:29.265
Is there any good news?

26:29.266 --> 26:31.267
We may have a way to reclaim your sister.

26:31.268 --> 26:32.802
A single chance

26:32.803 --> 26:34.437
to sidestep the rules of purgatory.

26:34.438 --> 26:35.705
Are you familiar with a sketchbook

26:35.706 --> 26:37.440
created by Benjamin Franklin?

26:37.441 --> 26:39.442
One with a drawing of a key in it?

26:39.443 --> 26:41.878
- The very same.
- Henry is looking for it.

26:41.879 --> 26:45.215
Or at least he was until he
read my sins and saw the pages.

26:45.216 --> 26:47.117
It should still be at the archives.

26:47.118 --> 26:49.052
Let's hope so.

26:59.002 --> 27:01.852
It's written in some kind of code.

27:02.562 --> 27:04.431
You still haven't learned
my alphabet, have you?

27:04.432 --> 27:07.300
- There are only so many hours in the day.
- Rise earlier.

27:07.301 --> 27:09.402
The key to success lies
under the alarm clock.

27:10.705 --> 27:13.814
Learn my alphabet, Crane.

27:15.309 --> 27:18.545
Did you know Franklin
invented his own alphabet?

27:18.546 --> 27:21.698
I did, because he forced
me to study it endlessly,

27:21.699 --> 27:23.400
insisting that it was far superior

27:23.401 --> 27:25.602
to the standard 26-letter one.

27:25.603 --> 27:28.338
I see the world rejected it.

27:28.339 --> 27:30.240
And this tickles you because...?

27:30.241 --> 27:32.376
This code is his failed alphabet.

27:32.377 --> 27:35.245
Typical self-aggrandizing style,

27:35.246 --> 27:37.580
it says Franklin left the key

27:37.581 --> 27:38.982
in Sleepy Hollow

27:38.983 --> 27:41.784
with the only person he trusted.

27:42.753 --> 27:44.520
Himself.

27:46.557 --> 27:50.159
Benjamin Franklin isn't
buried in Sleepy Hollow.

27:51.462 --> 27:54.831
Although I have an idea
of one place to look.

28:14.118 --> 28:16.119
Oh, my God.

29:09.239 --> 29:11.874
Ichabod Crane.

29:15.045 --> 29:17.246
Crane!

29:22.519 --> 29:24.153
You're alive.

29:24.154 --> 29:25.188
Yes.

29:25.189 --> 29:27.557
We are survivors, you and I.

29:27.558 --> 29:29.726
You made it out of that coffin.

29:29.727 --> 29:31.661
And I found your sister.

29:31.662 --> 29:36.633
She is having a rather trying day as well.

29:36.634 --> 29:38.902
And yours is not looking much better.

29:38.903 --> 29:41.071
We're in Moloch's lair.

29:41.072 --> 29:44.074
Moloch's lair.

29:44.075 --> 29:45.475
We don't have much time.

29:45.476 --> 29:47.644
Moloch is raising an entire demon army.

29:47.645 --> 29:50.080
Every lost soul in purgatory,

29:50.081 --> 29:51.781
unleashed on Earth.

29:51.782 --> 29:54.684
Moloch needs the key

29:54.685 --> 29:57.354
to unlock the door to purgatory.

29:57.355 --> 29:59.623
A key he does not yet have.

29:59.624 --> 30:03.093
Miss Jenny and I are on
our way to retrieve it.

30:03.094 --> 30:04.961
And we can get you out.

30:04.962 --> 30:08.932
What if that's what they want?

30:08.933 --> 30:11.101
We get the key for them.

30:11.102 --> 30:12.669
That's why they tricked us

30:12.670 --> 30:15.338
into believing that a year had passed.

30:15.339 --> 30:17.140
What if we're walking into another trap?

30:19.877 --> 30:22.879
Maybe you don't come back.

30:24.015 --> 30:26.382
And leave you here?

30:27.685 --> 30:28.985
No.

30:28.986 --> 30:30.387
Lieutenant?

30:30.388 --> 30:32.555
I do not accept good-bye.

30:32.556 --> 30:35.358
I need you to protect the key.

30:35.359 --> 30:37.160
We're fighting a war, Crane.

30:37.161 --> 30:40.163
Coming back for me is a
risk I cannot let you take.

30:41.465 --> 30:44.734
The Bible foretells two Witnesses.

30:46.003 --> 30:48.038
You and I must remain together

30:48.039 --> 30:50.507
if there is any hope of victory.

30:50.508 --> 30:52.742
The only risk, Lieutenant,

30:52.743 --> 30:55.011
is in leaving you behind.

30:55.012 --> 30:58.715
No matter what I say, you're
coming back, aren't you?

30:58.716 --> 31:00.350
I made a promise.

31:03.921 --> 31:05.422
We need to be prepared.

31:05.423 --> 31:06.856
The second you open that door,

31:06.857 --> 31:08.992
Moloch and his army

31:08.993 --> 31:11.361
will do everything in
their power to get out.

31:13.698 --> 31:15.732
Katrina left you a charm

31:15.733 --> 31:17.600
to defend against Moloch. Do you have it?

31:17.601 --> 31:21.104
I dropped it in the
woods behind the church.

31:21.105 --> 31:22.172
I'll find it.

31:22.173 --> 31:23.506
We'll meet there.

31:23.507 --> 31:25.308
Hold fast, Abigail Mills.

31:25.839 --> 31:28.297
I'm on my way.

31:28.298 --> 31:30.413
Go!

31:34.462 --> 31:36.463
What was that?

31:36.464 --> 31:38.365
Crane?

31:38.366 --> 31:40.033
I've just seen your sister.

31:40.034 --> 31:41.034
What?!

31:41.035 --> 31:44.137
She doesn't have much time.

31:48.518 --> 31:50.098
Hessians.

31:50.353 --> 31:51.586
Henry must have deciphered

31:51.587 --> 31:53.788
- Franklin's alphabet as well.
- Hmm.

31:53.789 --> 31:56.624
Franklin created riddles in threes.

31:56.625 --> 31:59.093
The first was decoding his alphabet.

31:59.094 --> 32:02.230
The second was a clue to this location.

32:02.231 --> 32:04.799
This is the only statue of
Franklin in Sleepy Hollow.

32:05.868 --> 32:07.869
Wait, there are more?

32:07.870 --> 32:09.737
All over the country.

32:09.738 --> 32:11.606
Plus the Franklin Mint, the $100 bill.

32:11.607 --> 32:13.441
It's all about the Benjamins.

32:13.442 --> 32:15.276
Yes. It always was.

32:15.277 --> 32:17.545
Oh, Franklin was full of...

32:17.546 --> 32:19.547
aphorisms.

32:19.548 --> 32:23.585
The key to success lies
under the alarm clock.

32:23.586 --> 32:26.587
"The key to success lies
under the alarm clock."

32:32.561 --> 32:34.996
Oh, the arrogant...

32:52.488 --> 32:54.772
'Tis easy to see...

32:55.210 --> 32:58.113
...hard to foresee.

33:27.476 --> 33:29.444
I shall never submit to you.

33:29.445 --> 33:31.446
What do you want?

33:48.965 --> 33:51.800
This wasn't the
introduction I had hoped for.

33:52.802 --> 33:54.603
Abraham.

33:54.604 --> 33:56.037
If the point of this illusion

33:56.038 --> 33:57.806
is to convince me that...

33:57.807 --> 33:59.674
that part of you still remains human,

33:59.675 --> 34:01.843
I assure you, it will not work.

34:01.844 --> 34:03.978
I don't blame you for being confused.

34:05.448 --> 34:07.015
You have borne so much.

34:07.016 --> 34:08.550
We both have.

34:08.551 --> 34:11.353
Since the day you were stolen from me.

34:11.353 --> 34:14.322
My heart shall never belong to you.

34:14.322 --> 34:16.958
I have given it to one man only.

34:16.958 --> 34:19.094
Ichabod Crane will be dead by midnight.

34:23.165 --> 34:25.233
Shh.

34:25.234 --> 34:27.435
It's okay.

34:28.905 --> 34:30.572
The sooner you accept your fate,

34:30.572 --> 34:33.174
the sooner your life begins anew.

34:45.554 --> 34:47.589
Tell me the incantation.

34:47.590 --> 34:48.857
No, I do this alone.

34:48.858 --> 34:50.391
- Crane!
- Miss Jenny,

34:50.393 --> 34:52.664
this is my duty as a Witness.

34:52.665 --> 34:53.965
She's my sister.

34:53.966 --> 34:55.549
I'm coming with you at least.

34:55.550 --> 34:57.021
You, me and your sister,

34:57.022 --> 34:59.284
we're the only ones who know
the truth about any of this.

34:59.285 --> 35:00.538
Now, if anything should happen,

35:00.539 --> 35:02.440
if I don't return for some time...

35:02.441 --> 35:03.875
Don't even say it.

35:07.447 --> 35:09.447
You know the rules.

35:09.448 --> 35:11.482
No eating or drinking anything in there.

35:11.483 --> 35:13.918
Don't accept anything from anyone.

35:26.165 --> 35:28.833
We, the penitent, with humble heart,

35:28.834 --> 35:31.502
upon this threshold do summon thee.

35:31.503 --> 35:33.705
In mirrored form appear,

35:33.706 --> 35:37.542
a gateway to the world between worlds.

35:45.684 --> 35:46.951
Go get her.

36:01.233 --> 36:03.935
I need that amulet.

36:03.936 --> 36:06.704
Where is the damn thing?!

36:06.705 --> 36:09.440
This amulet, it will
protect you from Moloch.

36:13.178 --> 36:14.445
Come on.

36:14.446 --> 36:16.214
Moloch's coming.

36:16.889 --> 36:18.889
I need this amulet.

36:22.521 --> 36:23.707
I'm here.

36:23.708 --> 36:26.557
Just as I promised.

36:28.727 --> 36:30.595
All right.

36:30.596 --> 36:31.896
You're all right.

36:33.632 --> 36:35.533
Wait.

36:35.534 --> 36:39.170
I couldn't find Katrina's amulet.

36:40.439 --> 36:42.840
My God, you're parched.

36:43.909 --> 36:45.276
Here.

36:46.111 --> 36:47.678
Drink this.

36:51.050 --> 36:53.217
Lieutenant!

36:53.218 --> 36:54.418
Lieutenant, no!

37:04.572 --> 37:06.364
She doesn't belong to you.

37:06.504 --> 37:08.404
You both do now.

37:27.491 --> 37:29.659
Go.

37:29.660 --> 37:30.927
Go!

37:30.928 --> 37:32.495
Go, quickly.

37:32.496 --> 37:34.597
We have to go.

37:41.839 --> 37:43.300
Are you all right?

37:43.301 --> 37:45.508
Let's go home.

37:45.509 --> 37:46.743
We recite the incantation,

37:46.744 --> 37:49.379
we return to your sister.

37:49.380 --> 37:51.814
Finally, Lieutenant.

38:01.193 --> 38:02.923
Lieutenant!

38:07.779 --> 38:09.980
How did you know that wasn't me?

38:09.981 --> 38:12.149
Because he didn't say "lef-tenant."

38:12.984 --> 38:15.452
Well, I kept my promise.

38:17.756 --> 38:19.490
Pow.

38:20.892 --> 38:22.727
I'll show you that other part later.

38:27.432 --> 38:30.367
It's Moloch.

38:54.793 --> 38:56.427
Now is a good time to leave.

38:56.428 --> 38:58.028
Couldn't agree with you more.

39:02.100 --> 39:04.368
We, the penitent, with humble heart,

39:04.369 --> 39:06.203
upon this threshold do summon thee.

39:06.204 --> 39:07.538
In mirrored form appear,

39:07.539 --> 39:09.340
a gateway to the world between worlds.

39:50.849 --> 39:53.584
Now Moloch will never have it.

39:56.722 --> 39:58.581
I hope we'll never need

39:58.582 --> 39:59.779
that key again, either.

40:02.783 --> 40:05.651
- Oh!
- Welcome home!

40:05.652 --> 40:07.853
I am so glad to see you.

40:11.258 --> 40:12.658
Heard I missed a surprise party.

40:27.774 --> 40:30.309
So...

40:30.310 --> 40:33.012
Who's had a rough day?

40:34.314 --> 40:36.319
Come on, we stopped Moloch

40:36.320 --> 40:38.487
from launching phase
two of the End of Days.

40:38.488 --> 40:40.189
I'd say we've earned a victory lap.

40:40.190 --> 40:41.524
A little one.

40:46.396 --> 40:48.064
You and I have some catching up to do.

40:48.065 --> 40:49.632
Where to begin?

40:49.633 --> 40:53.669
My wife is now a captive
of the Horseman of Death.

40:53.670 --> 40:57.039
And the Horseman of War is my son.

40:59.309 --> 41:02.244
We may have stopped Moloch today,

41:02.245 --> 41:03.713
but he is still down there.

41:03.714 --> 41:06.415
The war has begun in earnest.

41:06.416 --> 41:09.752
Today was merely an opening salvo.

41:09.753 --> 41:11.487
They've been planning
this since before the birth

41:11.488 --> 41:13.589
of our nation.

41:13.590 --> 41:17.226
They used violence. They used deception.

41:17.227 --> 41:20.730
They twisted our blood
bonds for their ends.

41:20.731 --> 41:22.064
One thing I know for sure,

41:22.065 --> 41:23.799
we're not gonna be fooled again.

41:24.835 --> 41:27.803
This is war.

41:40.117 --> 41:41.784
Father,

41:41.785 --> 41:44.420
my Lord Moloch.

41:44.421 --> 41:46.622
With my heart, King.

41:48.458 --> 41:50.760
The key is destroyed.

41:50.761 --> 41:53.372
I could not retrieve it.

41:53.373 --> 41:55.428
_

41:57.683 --> 42:00.642
_

42:16.460 --> 42:19.222
_

42:20.042 --> 42:22.073
_

42:23.305 --> 42:25.372
_

42:30.754 --> 42:33.260
_

42:33.632 --> 42:35.765
_

42:39.342 --> 42:41.811
As God himself declared,

42:41.812 --> 42:44.246
I bring not peace,

42:44.247 --> 42:46.048
but a sword.

43:00.797 --> 43:03.999
Magnificent.
