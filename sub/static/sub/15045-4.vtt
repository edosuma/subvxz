02:40.661 --> 02:43.629
<i>There was even a phase</i>
<i>where he barely left his room</i>

02:43.664 --> 02:47.432

03:19.433 --> 03:23.569
<i>Eric was so rebellious</i>
<i>that he wanted the room dark.</i>

03:23.604 --> 03:25.304
I'd been wanting to do this
for years,

03:25.339 --> 03:29.908
just to give it
a fresh new look.

03:29.944 --> 03:33.178

Hey, babe.

05:08.776 --> 05:11.243
Baby, what's the matter?

05:11.278 --> 05:14.946
- There's a man standing
next to my bed.

05:14.982 --> 05:19.217
- He said that he was tall
and he was smiling.

05:19.253 --> 05:21.887
- It's just a nightmare, baby.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.221

No.

05:34.068 --> 05:35.734
Not over here.

05:35.769 --> 05:38.337

I never could sleep.

06:58.185 --> 07:00.218
I knew someone was in my room.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.862
<i>Then it got really quiet,</i>

07:10.898 --> 07:13.565

You scared the willies

07:42.429 --> 07:43.395
It's good to see you.

07:43.430 --> 07:44.696
- It's good to see you, too.

07:44.731 --> 07:46.231
- It'd been about
a month and a half,

07:46.266 --> 07:49.434
so I figured I would just drive
out there and check on them.

07:49.470 --> 07:50.535
- Gage?

07:50.571 --> 07:52.204
- I wanted to see
how Gage was doing.

07:52.239 --> 07:53.371
I was just really eager
to see him.

07:53.407 --> 07:54.940
- Come here.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.342
How you doing?
Come here.

08:02.082 --> 08:04.349

brought back some good memories.

08:07.855 --> 08:10.222
But it brought back
some bad memories.

08:20.934 --> 08:24.135

<i>to get takeout</i>

08:24.171 --> 08:26.271
to bring home
to treat everyone

08:26.306 --> 08:29.541

that's what Eric liked to eat.

08:29.576 --> 08:31.543
- Hey.

08:31.578 --> 08:34.279

What are these?

We saw that the porch light
was on and...

08:55.903 --> 08:57.302
- Who's that?

08:59.873 --> 09:02.941
- This man was in your room?

09:02.976 --> 09:06.177
- Gage told me that he had seen
a man in his room

09:06.213 --> 09:07.579
that was looking back at him

09:07.614 --> 09:09.748

a whole lot.

09:09.783 --> 09:13.285
<i>¶ ¶</i>

09:13.320 --> 09:16.321

wearing all black.

09:19.626 --> 09:22.027

09:22.062 --> 09:23.895
- My stomach felt tight.

09:23.931 --> 09:27.532
I wanted to throw up.

09:27.568 --> 09:31.469
- He was there for one moment

09:31.505 --> 09:33.638
<i>and then gone.</i>

09:33.674 --> 09:36.274
- He just disappeared.

11:14.274 --> 11:17.642
And then he crossed the hallway

11:19.646 --> 11:23.281
Oh, my God,

11:32.592 --> 11:34.125
I said, "It came in here."

"Hon, there's nothing in here."

12:45.498 --> 12:46.865
- Okay.

Someone that could help us
get this out of our home.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.708

I was born to be a pastor.

I was one of those kids
that when I was young,

I'd walk
down the railroad tracks

14:04.244 --> 14:07.045
They needed help.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.746

14:08.782 --> 14:12.583
can you tell me from the
beginning when this started?

14:12.619 --> 14:15.353
- I told him that everything
started happening

14:15.388 --> 14:17.822
the day that our son Eric
had moved out.

14:21.494 --> 14:22.927

14:25.432 --> 14:28.833
That's when I first began
to wonder,

14:28.868 --> 14:31.369
was Eric hiding something?

14:41.247 --> 14:42.880
- I felt like he knew
that there was something

I wanted to get off my chest.

14:45.318 --> 14:46.651

She was over to my right.

She broke up with me when she
realized that I'd changed.

33:15.961 --> 33:19.162
I became something different.

33:19.198 --> 33:22.032
I think she started
recognizing a darkness in me,

33:22.067 --> 33:25.102
an evil in me.

33:25.137 --> 33:28.405
<i>That's when I realized</i>

He tried to make a pact

<i>This is the real world.</i>

42:45.131 --> 42:46.330
It's not a game.

42:46.365 --> 42:48.566
There's no extra lives

42:48.601 --> 42:50.501
You have one life.

42:50.536 --> 42:53.704
And you need to be
careful how you use it.
