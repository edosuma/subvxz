MALE NARRATOR: Previously on
Prison Break:

00:03.378 --> 00:06.089
- I didn't kill that man, Michael.
- The evidence says you did.

00:06.173 --> 00:07.424
I was set up.

00:07.508 --> 00:08.717
(GUN FIRES)

00:09.301 --> 00:10.636
<i>OFFICER: Put down your weapon!</i>

00:10.719 --> 00:13.472
I find it incumbent
that you see the inside of a prison cell.

00:13.555 --> 00:14.598
I'm looking for someone.

00:14.681 --> 00:15.682
A guy named Lincoln Burrows.

00:15.766 --> 00:17.267
Man killed the Vice President's brother.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.102
Why you want to see Burrows
so bad anyhow?

00:19.186 --> 00:20.187
<i>Because he's my brother.</i>

00:20.270 --> 00:21.355
I'm getting you out of here.

00:21.438 --> 00:24.566
- It's impossible.
- Not if you designed the place, it isn't.

00:24.650 --> 00:26.818
- You've seen the blueprints.
- Better than that.

00:26.902 --> 00:28.111
I've got them on me.

00:28.946 --> 00:30.280
You find out who's trying to bury him.

00:30.364 --> 00:31.573
Nobody's trying to bury him.

00:31.657 --> 00:32.991
The evidence was cooked.

00:33.075 --> 00:34.451
There's a lawyer poking around.

00:34.535 --> 00:37.162
Anyone that's a threat is expendable.

00:39.623 --> 00:41.208
LINCOLN: I'm gonna kill that scum.
SCOFIELD: You won't.

00:41.291 --> 00:43.794
You kill him,
you kill our express ticket out of here.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.170
What are you doing here?
Where's Maricruz?

00:45.254 --> 00:46.463
She's with me now.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.298
Fish, I gotta be back in.

00:48.382 --> 00:49.967
Nick Savrinn with Project Justice.

00:50.050 --> 00:54.054
My boss may not think Lincoln's
case is worth looking into, but I do.

00:54.596 --> 00:55.639
When do we get started?

00:55.722 --> 00:57.641
Getting through this wall
is just the beginning.

00:57.724 --> 01:01.186
<i>There's a whole lot of real estate in
between here and the outside walls.</i>

01:01.270 --> 01:02.980
That is a transfer request.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.816
<i>Michael Scofield
is getting shipped out tomorrow.</i>

01:07.693 --> 01:08.694
(WHIRRING)

01:38.849 --> 01:41.518
I assume this is about
your transfer request for Michael Scofield.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.854
More specifically, why you denied it.

01:44.396 --> 01:45.397
Look, Mr. Kellerman,

01:45.480 --> 01:49.234
do I come into your house
and tell you where to put your furniture?

01:49.318 --> 01:51.612
We're just asking
for a professional courtesy.

01:51.695 --> 01:54.448
But you're asking for a federal courtesy
in a state penitentiary.

01:54.531 --> 01:56.533
Most people in your position
would be happy

01:56.617 --> 01:58.201
to have another body taken
off their hands.

01:58.285 --> 01:59.870
These men are my responsibility.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.705
From the minute
they walk through those walls

02:01.788 --> 02:03.874
to the time
that they've paid their debt to society,

02:03.957 --> 02:05.417
I'm responsible for them.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.544
Which means that unless Mr. Scofield
has done something I don't know about,

02:08.628 --> 02:11.840
he is gonna stay here at Fox River,
under my watch.

02:12.215 --> 02:13.800
Mr. Pope, in our line of work,

02:13.884 --> 02:16.386
we've discovered that
just about everyone has done something

02:16.470 --> 02:18.472
that someone doesn't know about.

02:20.807 --> 02:23.477
- What's this?
- Right now, just a piece of history.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.312
Whether it becomes a current event,

02:25.395 --> 02:26.855
now, that's up to you.

02:32.110 --> 02:34.988
My wife already knows about Toledo.

02:35.072 --> 02:36.740
Does she, really?

02:43.455 --> 02:45.082
You're a smart man, Warden.

02:45.457 --> 02:47.501
I'm sure if you look hard enough,
you can find a reason

02:47.584 --> 02:49.961
why Michael Scofield's presence
is no longer required

02:50.045 --> 02:52.506
at this particular correctional facility.

- Sure thing, Burrows.

03:22.994 --> 03:25.580
But, hey,
I'm gonna check your trunk for splinters.

03:25.664 --> 03:27.999

- Sure.

what this is all about?

03:54.776 --> 03:57.237
These are the guys
we're breaking outwith.

03:57.863 --> 04:01.658
I don't think so, Fish.
That was not our agreement.

04:02.743 --> 04:05.871
I'm not gonna work with this crazy rhino.

04:05.996 --> 04:06.997
Keep pushing it, John.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.207
Yeah, I keep pushing it, you know.

04:09.624 --> 04:11.209
What's your deal, man?

04:11.710 --> 04:14.337

Brother? Your brother?

04:25.348 --> 04:27.184
We've only got a few minutes.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.102
Are we gonna spend them
spitting on each other,

04:29.186 --> 04:31.062
or are we gonna talk some business?

04:31.146 --> 04:34.316
The reason we're all here today is
we have a decision to make.

04:34.399 --> 04:37.360
ABRUZZI: Yeah?
LINCOLN: English, Fitz or Percy.

04:37.444 --> 04:40.989
If we're gonna pull this off,
we need to take one of them out.

04:42.491 --> 04:45.243
And you want us to tell you which one?

04:45.327 --> 04:48.789
I just want you to help me get to them.
I'll take it from there.

04:48.872 --> 04:50.957
- You're crazy, you know that?
- All I need is five minutes.

04:51.041 --> 04:52.834
Oh, you won't even get five seconds.

04:52.918 --> 04:54.961

everything worked out, Fish.

We're not breaking out

It's gonna take a little more
than digging a few holes.

There are eyes, ears, dots that
couldn't be connected from the outside.

He's my brother.

Okay. Steadman.

VERONICA: A car, a pedestrian.

10:12.278 --> 10:15.782
No, no. His eye line is too high, right?
It's like he's looking right into the camera.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.534
He might as well be saying "cheese."

10:19.702 --> 10:21.079
Now he just sits there.

- Right.

10:27.210 --> 10:28.711
There. That's a 9 mm.

Shouldn't there be some kind of kick
or something?

10:30.964 --> 10:32.006
Lincoln's pretty strong.

10:32.090 --> 10:34.509
Yeah, but strong enough to bury a recoil?

10:34.884 --> 10:38.555
Now, you shoot someone,
supposedly for revenge,

10:38.638 --> 10:41.516
do you take the time to go back in
and hit the glove box,

10:41.599 --> 10:42.851
or do you just get the hell out of there?

10:42.934 --> 10:45.228
Feds said he was trying
to make it look like a robbery.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.271
No.

10:47.856 --> 10:48.898
Look.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.734
Look at Lincoln's angle
as he leaves the frame.

10:53.236 --> 10:55.238

his face from the camera,

10:59.993 --> 11:01.494
he comes back in. Why?

they'd already planted in his apartment.

- Nick, this is great.
- Yeah.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.003
- Who should we go to?
- Nobody. Yet.

I mean, to the unbiased eye, we're just
backing a horse that died in the gate.

11:13.381 --> 11:14.799
A lot of what-ifs and conjecture.

11:14.883 --> 11:17.760
You know, we don't have anything.
We need some evidence.

11:17.844 --> 11:20.221
Look, if Lincoln didn't fire this gun,

11:20.305 --> 11:22.932
then somebody with some serious skills
went to work on this tape

11:23.016 --> 11:26.060
-to prove that he did.
- Fine. But how do we prove that?

11:27.353 --> 11:28.730
I know a guy.

11:29.105 --> 11:30.607
You know a guy?

Yeah, I know a guy.

There's been talk
about you packing your bags.

Don't believe everything you hear.
I'm not going anywhere.

11:47.123 --> 11:50.293
You know,
I have a really hard time trusting you, Fish.

11:50.376 --> 11:53.087
The important thing is
that we stay on schedule.

11:53.504 --> 11:56.758
- Yeah? English, Fitz or Percy?
- English, Fitz or Percy.

11:56.841 --> 11:59.260
You wanna know
which one I think we should take out?

11:59.344 --> 12:03.431
All due respect, I don't need opinions.
I need answers.

12:03.514 --> 12:05.141
Remember, the warden leaves
at 5:00 tonight.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.393
So by 5:05, we're gonna need that key.

12:07.477 --> 12:10.480
And how is this key gonna
give you the answers?

12:10.563 --> 12:13.733
I'll worry about that.
You worry about getting the key.

12:13.816 --> 12:18.613
Hey, this key better be worth it.
Understand?

12:25.828 --> 12:27.664
Afternoon, Mr. Scofield.

12:28.915 --> 12:31.960
I need to know if there's any way
to block a transfer order.

12:32.043 --> 12:35.546
- There's about 50 ways.
- All right. I'll take the quickest.

12:36.172 --> 12:40.426
You file a motion for what they call
an interlocutory injunction.

12:40.510 --> 12:43.304
- How long does that take?
- How fast can you write?

12:43.388 --> 12:47.517
A man can claim almost
anything violates his constitutional rights.

12:47.600 --> 12:51.396
There's environmental issues, allergies,
religious requirements.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.189
- Take your pick.
- What if they don't buy it?

12:53.273 --> 12:55.900
Don't matter. Court's required by law
to hear your motion.

12:55.984 --> 12:58.403
Till they do, you can't be transferred.

12:58.486 --> 13:02.615
Hell, they've been trying to move
my tired gray behind for 10 years.

13:02.991 --> 13:05.535
God bless the American legal system.

13:06.703 --> 13:09.205
Why do you want to stay in here so badly?

13:09.539 --> 13:12.375
There's someone here
I can't bear to leave behind.

13:13.584 --> 13:16.421
I guess that means
we got something in common.

13:18.006 --> 13:20.633
The State's requiring a physical
for Lincoln Burrows.

13:20.717 --> 13:22.302
- You heard the news, didn't you?
- Thanks.

13:22.385 --> 13:24.595
- No, what?
- They're brothers.

13:24.679 --> 13:26.597
- Who?
- Burrows and Scofield.

13:27.724 --> 13:29.183
Michael Scofield?

13:29.267 --> 13:31.561
Heard it from one of the CO's
over in Gen Pop.

13:31.644 --> 13:34.147
- He didn't say anything to you about it?
- No.

13:34.230 --> 13:37.358
Well, it must be hard
to be here so close to your brother

13:37.442 --> 13:39.902
and not be able
to do anything to help him.

13:47.994 --> 13:50.204
- What's this?
- A little bathroom reading.

13:50.288 --> 13:51.289

it's gonna take 30 days to process.

You mean in in? Now?
I thought you were waiting till...

14:12.101 --> 14:14.103

how I'm getting up there,

Yo, Fish. Fish, you're taking too long, bro.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.504
My cousin, he died from too much stress.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.090
I thought you said
your cousin was moving in on your girl.

18:11.173 --> 18:14.176
That's my other cousin.
But thanks for bringing that up, jackass.

18:14.260 --> 18:18.514
Look, the good news is
I can get to the roof.

18:19.307 --> 18:20.349
So what happens now?

18:20.433 --> 18:23.269

NO. DO you?

the tape might have been doctored?

19:27.792 --> 19:31.003
No. The problem with your eyes is
that they play tricks on you.

19:31.087 --> 19:33.589
But your ears... Ears don't lie.

19:33.798 --> 19:36.759
Look. Here's the audio track from the tape.

19:37.259 --> 19:39.512
- There. Sound pretty true, right?
- Yeah.

Stripped down,

19:58.447 --> 20:00.282
The sound of the gunshot.

20:00.491 --> 20:02.785
It wasn't recorded in that room.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.791
Would you testify to that?

20:08.874 --> 20:11.711
(STAMMERING) I don't know.
I mean, the tape you gave me is a dupe.

- Sinusitis.

It's not an allergy, actually.
It's a bacterial infection.

Well, you've got one up on me, Warden.

20:48.414 --> 20:50.332
You know why I needed
to file those motions,

20:50.416 --> 20:53.377
but I have no idea
why you needed to transfer me.

20:53.878 --> 20:56.964
Traffic control, Scofield, that's all.
Traffic control.

20:57.673 --> 21:00.593
Look, it's coming up on 5:00.
What do you say we call it a day?

21:00.676 --> 21:02.928
-(GRUNTS) I don't think I can do that, sir.
- Why not?

21:03.012 --> 21:06.182
If I let go of this support right now,
the whole thing is coming down.

21:06.265 --> 21:09.018
See, the Taj was designed
using axial force.

21:09.101 --> 21:12.438
A series of internal forces
along the longitudinal axis...

21:12.521 --> 21:14.565
Yeah. How much longer?

21:14.648 --> 21:17.193
Depends on how long it takes to dry.

21:17.359 --> 21:20.946
If you need me to leave,
I can show your secretary how to hold it.

21:21.030 --> 21:22.198
All right, you can stay till it dries.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.783
There'll be a guard waiting
outside the door.

21:23.866 --> 21:25.284
Just check in with Becky
when you're done

21:25.367 --> 21:27.620
and she'll have somebody escort you
back to your cell.

21:27.703 --> 21:29.747
- All right.
- And, Scofield...

21:32.583 --> 21:35.044
I wanna thank you for showing up today.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.171
I would have understood it if you didn't.

21:37.254 --> 21:38.631
We had a deal.

21:38.714 --> 21:41.258
Right. Still, thanks.

who happen to know each other

22:05.991 --> 22:08.202
and happen to show up
at the same movie theater

22:08.285 --> 22:10.663

just as good as you did when we first met.

- How about from this one?
- Even better.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.134
Those are for your guests.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.303
- Guests?
- Your associates.

23:07.386 --> 23:10.139
They said you had a meeting.
They're in the den.

23:19.106 --> 23:20.482
Evening, Warden.

24:06.111 --> 24:07.363
<i>POPE: There's nothing I can do.</i>

24:07.905 --> 24:10.532
I'm legally obligated
to file every properly drafted motion

24:10.616 --> 24:12.743
with the court,
so that a hearing can be scheduled.

24:12.826 --> 24:14.119
And how long does that take?

24:14.203 --> 24:18.374
A month, maybe two if there's a logjam.
I'm sorry, but it's out of my hands.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.876
Why do I get the feeling
you're not all that disappointed?

24:20.960 --> 24:23.379
May I ask you a question, Warden?

24:24.380 --> 24:26.382
More of an observation, really.

24:26.882 --> 24:29.218
I was looking at the morgue photos

24:29.301 --> 24:32.221
of that boy back in Toledo, Will Clayton.

24:32.304 --> 24:36.016
And, my Lord, if he wasn't
the spitting image of his daddy.

24:38.060 --> 24:41.355
Apple fell real far from the tree
with that one, didn't it?

24:41.981 --> 24:44.775
It fell off the tree.
Fell all over the pavement.

24:45.859 --> 24:47.569
You son of a bitch.

24:48.070 --> 24:50.322
Your wife gave you a pass on the affair.

24:50.572 --> 24:51.740
But something tells me

24:51.824 --> 24:54.076
that's pretty much all the forgiveness
she's got left in her bag.

24:54.159 --> 24:56.662
Especially when it comes
to an illegitimate child.

24:56.745 --> 24:59.832
What happened with young Will, Warden?

25:01.208 --> 25:04.378
- Get out of my house.
- Lose Scofield's paperwork.

25:06.255 --> 25:10.175
- You gentlemen staying for dinner?
- Thanks, but I think we're on our way.

25:10.259 --> 25:13.220
Judy, it was a real pleasure. Thank you.

25:13.303 --> 25:16.598

the best iced tea I've ever had.

to hold on to this one.

25:21.603 --> 25:23.480
- I will.
- Good.

25:28.277 --> 25:29.778
Is everything all right?

25:29.862 --> 25:31.780
Oh, yeah. Just fine, I...

to take care of.

to give you a physical this evening.

26:29.254 --> 26:31.799
That's all right. Just doing your job.

Yeah, well, letting the State know
that you're healthy enough to execute

26:35.928 --> 26:38.388
is not why I went to medical school.

26:39.473 --> 26:41.642
- I apologize.
- That's okay.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.064
All right.

26:48.273 --> 26:51.610
I'm going to need a family medical history
from you.

that are hereditary.

26:54.822 --> 26:58.367

- Cancer. Liver.

26:58.450 --> 26:59.910
Okay. Father?

Are you seeking his forgiveness or advice?

28:57.694 --> 28:58.654
(LAUGHS)

28:59.112 --> 29:01.198
I really don't know anymore, Ben.

29:03.200 --> 29:05.202
All I know is my son Will

29:06.328 --> 29:08.205
was my responsibility.

29:09.039 --> 29:11.583
And if I'd stayed in his life,
I could have saved his life.

29:11.667 --> 29:14.127
His death was an accident, Henry.

29:18.382 --> 29:21.510
He was a criminal and an addict.

29:23.178 --> 29:24.930
But he was only 18 years old.

29:25.013 --> 29:28.267
His mother made it clear
you couldn't be in his life

29:28.558 --> 29:30.102
if you weren't going to be in hers.

29:30.185 --> 29:33.188
When you chose to stay with Judy,
you understood that.

29:33.855 --> 29:36.566
I not only understood it,
I was grateful for it.

29:37.859 --> 29:41.571
I told myself I was respecting her wishes.

29:43.323 --> 29:46.368
I cursed her under my breath,
while every day

29:47.327 --> 29:50.706
I thanked God for allowing me
to wash my hands of her,

29:50.998 --> 29:52.291
of Toledo,

29:55.168 --> 29:56.545
all of it. I...

29:58.922 --> 30:00.549
So I ran home

30:01.717 --> 30:03.051
to Judy

30:04.469 --> 30:06.179
and I buried the secret.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.559
But I never got a chance

30:12.352 --> 30:14.688
to bury my son.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.078
What kind of a person does that, Ben?

just to make their own life easier.

30:39.421 --> 30:41.256
You can argue with me all night.

Believe me,
I haven't got anything better to do.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.594
But it won't change the fact

30:45.677 --> 30:49.097
that I can't just hand out
original copies of evidence.

to watch it?

30:56.271 --> 30:58.607

the entire time.

- He never checked outwith you?
- No.

35:09.649 --> 35:11.443

- Still locked, sir. I checked.

35:14.195 --> 35:15.864
What's going on?

35:15.947 --> 35:18.658
You're in the Warden's office after hours.
I could kill you

35:18.742 --> 35:21.202
and the paperwork wouldn't need
much more than the date.

- All right, Deputy, that's enough.

The work wasn't dry.
You said to stay until it was.

- You were in here the whole time?
- Yes, sir.

It's true. I never saw him leave.

Warden, all due respect, this is ridiculous.

we were coming for the tape?

exactly where to look?
