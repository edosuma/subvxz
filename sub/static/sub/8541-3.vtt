HALFA STEP CLOSER TO HIM,

12:09.337 --> 12:12.906
I WOULD CROSS DESERT WASTES
TO TELL YOU.

12:12.993 --> 12:15.169
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

12:15.256 --> 12:17.780
[knock on door] AVANTI.

12:17.867 --> 12:20.261
AH, STARSKY AND HUTCH.

12:20.348 --> 12:22.002
THANK GOODNESS.

12:22.089 --> 12:25.440
MR. JANE MIGHT HAVE CUT ME
INTO SMALL CUBES BY NOW.

12:31.707 --> 12:34.405
GOD IS IN YOUR MIND,
RIGHT HERE.

12:34.492 --> 12:37.974
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO TO SEE HIM
IS CLEAR OUT THE BAD ENERGY.

12:38.061 --> 12:39.715
I'LL REPEAT THE QUESTION.

12:39.802 --> 12:42.457
HAVE YOU SEEN CELIA JOVANOVICH
IN THE PAST 48 HOURS?

12:42.544 --> 12:44.807
I'VE BEEN VISITING MY MOTHER
IN CHINO.

12:44.894 --> 12:46.461
I GOT BACK THIS MORNING.

12:46.548 --> 12:48.550
THAT'S ALL I NEED. THANKS.AREN'T YOU INTERESTED

12:48.637 --> 12:52.815
IN THE PATH TO SPIRITUAL CLARITY
AND PERSONAL FREEDOM?NO.

12:55.339 --> 12:56.863
HOW'S IT GOIN'?

12:56.950 --> 12:59.430
WELL, CELIA WAS NICE,
AND A GOOD TEAM MEMBER,

12:59.517 --> 13:03.565
AND JOINING VISUALIZE IS A GOOD
IDEA. THAT'S IT, PRETTY MUCH.KEEP TRYING. YOU SEEN JANE?

13:03.652 --> 13:06.655
YEAH, HE'S UPSTAIRS.
VANDER HOEK TOOK HIM UPSTAIRS
TO SEE CELIA'S ROOM.

13:06.742 --> 13:09.136
IS HE OKAY?I GUESS. WHY?

13:09.223 --> 13:12.922
NOTHING. STILES JUST SEEMS
TO GET TO HIM A LITTLE BIT.THAT'S A NEAT TRICK.

13:13.009 --> 13:15.272
YEAH, I WISH
HE'D TEACH IT TO ME.

13:15.359 --> 13:18.319
I GOT THE FIANCE'S DETAILS.
DAVID HERREN WORKS
AT A RESTAURANT DOWNTOWN.

13:18.406 --> 13:20.451
GO TALK TO HIM.OKAY.

13:20.538 --> 13:22.845
YOU--COME ON. LET'S TALK.

13:22.932 --> 13:24.760
BEFORE WE DO,
CAN I JUST ASK,

13:24.847 --> 13:26.762
ARE YOU HAPPY IN YOUR LIVES?

13:30.070 --> 13:32.159
SIT DOWN.

13:34.639 --> 13:36.859
THIS WAS CELIA'S ROOM.

13:38.513 --> 13:40.167
THANK YOU.

14:14.549 --> 14:15.550
DAVID HERREN?

14:15.637 --> 14:17.857
YEAH.WAYNE RIGSBY, CBI.

14:17.944 --> 14:21.512
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT CELIA JOVANOVICH.YEAH. THE THING IS I--

14:21.599 --> 14:25.081
ONE MOMENT, DAVID.
HI. I'M JULIUS COLES,
DAVID'S ATTORNEY.

14:25.168 --> 14:28.998
WOW. YOU GUYS ARE ORGANIZED."US GUYS"? FEELS PREJUDICIAL.

14:29.085 --> 14:31.783
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS?NO, SIR.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.134
I WAS A MESS
WHEN I HEARD THE NEWS.

14:34.221 --> 14:36.179
BUT I REMEMBER
WHAT MR. STILES SAYS--

14:36.266 --> 14:40.227
CLARIFY THE MIND WITH
DISCIPLINE, ORDER, WORK.ARE YOU THE HEAD CHEF?

14:40.314 --> 14:43.317
PREP CHEF NOW.
MAYBE MORE THAN THAT SOMEDAY.

14:43.404 --> 14:45.536
HOW LONG HAD YOU BEEN
ENGAGED TO CELIA?

14:45.623 --> 14:48.844
A COUPLE OF WEEKS.AND HOW LONG
HAD YOU KNOWN HER BEFORE?

14:48.931 --> 14:50.890
I DIDN'T... KNOW HER.
I MEAN--

14:50.977 --> 14:52.979
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

14:53.066 --> 14:54.763
I HAD
NEVER SEEN HER BEFORE.

14:54.850 --> 14:56.460
HIGH LEVEL VISUALIZE MEMBERS

14:56.547 --> 14:58.549
OFTEN OPT FOR WHAT ARE CALLED
DESIGNED MARRIAGES.

14:58.636 --> 15:02.031
THE PARTNERS ARE MATCHED
FOR, UH...ENERGY CONSILIENCE.

15:02.118 --> 15:05.252
SO IT WAS
AN ARRANGED MARRIAGE?A RATIONAL MARRIAGE.

15:05.339 --> 15:07.994
I KNEW THE MINUTE I SAW CELIA
WE BELONGED TOGETHER.

15:08.081 --> 15:10.866
WAS THERE SOMEONE ELSE? SOMEONE
ANGRY ABOUT BEING REPLACED?

15:10.953 --> 15:13.608
AN EX-BOYFRIEND PERHAPS?ABSOLUTELY NOT.

15:13.695 --> 15:16.437
HOW CAN YOU BE SO CERTAIN?
YOU ONLY JUST MET HER.

15:16.524 --> 15:19.222
KNOWLEDGE COMES TO THOSE
WHO ARE OPEN TO IT, AGENT.

15:19.309 --> 15:23.139
I KNEW CELIA.
THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE.

15:23.226 --> 15:26.142
ARE YOU SURE?
BECAUSE CELIA WAS STRANGLED.

15:26.229 --> 15:29.319
THAT'S A KILLER WHO'S UPSET,
REALLY WANTS TO HURT THE VICTIM.

15:29.406 --> 15:33.497
THERE WASN'T ANYBODY WHO MIGHT
HAVE BEEN MAD AT YOU AND CELIA,
MIGHT'VE MADE YOUMAD?

15:33.584 --> 15:36.283
NO NEED TO ANSWER THAT.JUST TRYING TO GET THE PICTURE.

15:36.370 --> 15:40.330
YOU'RE POKING AT HIM WITH
WILD CONJECTURE TO SEE HOW
HE REACTS, I WON'T HAVE IT.

15:40.417 --> 15:42.419
THIS IS OVER.

15:45.683 --> 15:47.120
[exhales deeply]

16:28.639 --> 16:31.164
SO I CHECKED INTO HERREN.
COOKING'S JUST A HOBBY.

16:31.251 --> 16:33.427
HIS FAMILY'S LOADED--
OLD LUMBER MONEY.

16:33.514 --> 16:35.995
WHEN HE TURNS 27,
HE INHERITS $10 MILLION.

16:36.082 --> 16:38.432
THAT'S PROBABLY WHY
STILES ARRANGED THE MARRIAGE.

16:38.519 --> 16:42.262
WITH CELIA MARRIED TO HERREN,
THE CHURCH IS MORE LIKELY
TO TAP INTO THE MONEY.

16:42.349 --> 16:44.829
YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT MOTIVE
FOR HERREN TO KILL CELIA.

16:44.916 --> 16:48.485
OH, WAS THERE ANYTHING ELSE FROM
THE INTERVIEWS AT VISUALIZE?NOTHING USEFUL.

16:48.572 --> 16:51.880
THEY ALL SEEM SO HAPPY.
I MEAN, TRULY HAPPY.

16:51.967 --> 16:54.404
YEAH. IT'S CREEPY.

16:54.491 --> 16:57.668
JANE. KINDA LOST TRACK OF YOU
AT VISUALIZE.

16:57.755 --> 17:00.149
TOOK A NAP.

17:02.064 --> 17:03.892
IS SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND?

17:03.979 --> 17:06.764
NO, NO.
UM, I'M GONNA BE UPSTAIRS.

17:06.851 --> 17:09.985
UH...

17:10.072 --> 17:13.293
CELIA HAD SOME PROBLEMS
WITH VISUALIZE PHILOSOPHY--

17:13.380 --> 17:15.121
QUESTIONS,
ISSUES WITH THE DOGMA.

17:15.208 --> 17:18.211
SHE, UH, MIGHT HAVE WANTED
TO TALK TO SOMEONE ABOUT IT.

17:18.298 --> 17:20.952
SOMEONE OUTSIDE OF THE CHURCH.

17:24.217 --> 17:27.568
SOMEONE MENTIONED A FRIEND OF
HERS WHO WAS A MEMBER BUT LEFT.

17:27.655 --> 17:30.440
UM... LUCY JOEL.

17:33.617 --> 17:36.359
ARE YOU SURENOBODY WAS
FOLLOWING YOU, SAW YOU COME IN?

17:36.446 --> 17:38.492
LUCY, NOBODY FOLLOWED US.

17:38.579 --> 17:40.537
[Lucy sighs]
I'M NOT CRAZY, OKAY?

17:40.624 --> 17:43.584
I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED
AND THREATENED.

17:43.671 --> 17:47.153
VISUALIZE DOESN'T LIKE
WHEN PEOPLE LEAVE THE HIVE.

17:47.240 --> 17:49.459
WHEN YOU'RE A MEMBER,
EVERY WEEK YOU SIT DOWN

17:49.546 --> 17:54.334
IN FRONT OF A CAMERA AND LAY OUT
EVERY BAD THING YOU'VE DONE.

17:54.421 --> 17:56.597
I MEAN, EVERYTHING.

17:56.684 --> 17:58.294
IT'S CALLED VENTILATION.

17:58.381 --> 18:01.906
YOUR VENT VIDS.
IT'S SUPPOSED TO AIR YOU OUT.

18:01.993 --> 18:04.605
IT MAKES YOU FEEL GREAT,
CLEAN.

18:04.692 --> 18:06.868
[scoffs]
THEN WHEN YOU'RE LEAVING,

18:06.955 --> 18:10.698
THEY SAY, "WHOA. WE KNOW
ALL THIS NASTY STUFF.

18:10.785 --> 18:13.222
YOU'RE NOT GONNA SAY ANYTHING
BAD ABOUT VISUALIZE, ARE YOU?"

18:13.309 --> 18:15.268
WE'RE NOT HERE TO GET DIRT
ON VISUALIZE.

18:15.355 --> 18:17.226
WE WANNA TALK ABOUT CELIA.

18:17.313 --> 18:19.620
YEAH.

18:19.707 --> 18:21.100
SHE WAS SWEET,

18:21.187 --> 18:23.928
ALMOST TOO NICE, YOU KNOW?

18:24.015 --> 18:26.453
SHE NEEDED PEOPLE
A LITTLE TOO MUCH.

18:27.802 --> 18:29.717
SHE KNEW VISUALIZE WAS CRAZY,

18:29.804 --> 18:33.068
BUT THEY'D GOTTEN HER CLEAN.

18:33.155 --> 18:36.202
UGH. AND SHE WAS SCARED
TO LEAVE, YOU KNOW?

18:36.289 --> 18:39.118
THOUGHT SHE'D START USING
AGAIN.

18:39.205 --> 18:41.076
WAS SHE IN TOUCH WITH YOU?

18:41.163 --> 18:44.079
SHE'D CALL, JUST TO TALK,

18:44.166 --> 18:46.560
BITCH ABOUT THE CHURCH,
YOU KNOW, STUFF.

18:46.647 --> 18:49.432
WAS THERE ANYTHING SPECIFIC
ON HER MIND?

18:49.519 --> 18:52.740
I-I CAN'T. I'M SORRY.
I DON'T WANT ANY TROUBLE.WE CAN OFFER YOU--

18:52.827 --> 18:56.047
NO. IT WAS REALLY HARD
TO LEAVE THAT PLACE.

18:56.135 --> 18:59.486
NOW I'M GOOD WITH THE CHURCH,
AND THE CHURCH IS GOOD WITH ME.

18:59.573 --> 19:02.228
EVERYTHING'S GOOD.

19:02.315 --> 19:04.665
LISTEN,
I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED,

19:04.752 --> 19:07.146
BUT RIGHT NOW
YOU'RE CELIA'S GUARDIAN,

19:07.233 --> 19:09.235
THE ONLY ONE
THAT CAN HELP HER.

19:09.322 --> 19:11.846
IT'S UP TO YOU.

19:11.933 --> 19:15.502
[sighs]

19:15.589 --> 19:18.679
SHE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH
SOMEBODY VERY BIG IN THE CHURCH.

19:18.766 --> 19:21.290
SHE WOULDN'T TELL ME HIS NAME.

19:21.377 --> 19:24.032
THEN SHE WAS
SUPPOSED TO MARRY HERREN.

19:24.119 --> 19:25.555
AND HE WAS SWEET,

19:25.642 --> 19:28.036
KEPT SAYING HE LOVED HER.

19:28.123 --> 19:31.605
SHE FELT BAD LYING TO HIM.

19:31.692 --> 19:33.128
LAST TIME I TALKED TO HER,

19:33.215 --> 19:35.043
SHE SAID
SHE HAD TO DO SOMETHING,

19:35.130 --> 19:37.437
BUT SHE DIDN'T SAY WHAT.

19:38.829 --> 19:42.572
AND IF ANYBODY FINDS OUT
I TOLD YOU THAT,

19:42.659 --> 19:45.619
I AM SODEAD.

19:50.145 --> 19:51.364
YOU WERE GREAT IN THERE.

19:51.451 --> 19:52.756
"YOU'RE CELIA'S GUARDIAN."

19:52.843 --> 19:56.760
IT WAS NICE.

19:56.847 --> 19:58.371
I LIED THIS MORNING.

19:59.937 --> 20:01.939
I DO CARE THAT
YOU'RE SEEING SOMEONE ELSE.

20:02.026 --> 20:04.594
IT HURTS A LITTLE.

20:04.681 --> 20:08.076
I MEAN, IT'S NO BIGGIE.
I'LL GET OVER IT.

20:08.163 --> 20:10.513
I WANT US TO BE FRIENDS.

20:10.600 --> 20:11.732
[sighs]

20:11.819 --> 20:14.735
WE CAN GET TO THAT POINT,
RIGHT?

20:14.822 --> 20:16.998
CAN WE BE JUST FRIENDS?

20:17.085 --> 20:19.914
YEAH. SURE, WE CAN.

20:20.001 --> 20:21.959
GOOD. I'D LIKE THAT.

20:26.747 --> 20:29.184
BEHIND US.HUH?

20:29.271 --> 20:32.753
SOMEONE'S TAILING US.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.972
VISUALIZE?OH, YEAH.

20:35.059 --> 20:37.018
I GUESS LUCY ISN'T CRAZY.

20:37.105 --> 20:39.629
GETTING THE PLATES.

20:39.716 --> 20:40.935
SHOULD I PULL 'EM OVER?

20:41.022 --> 20:42.719
CAN YOU GET BEHIND 'EM?

20:42.806 --> 20:47.289
THROW A LOOP? EASY. WATCH.

20:47.376 --> 20:49.596
[engine revs]GRACE!

21:03.044 --> 21:05.394
YEAH.I JUST--
I JUST NEED A MINUTE.

21:05.481 --> 21:07.875
CAN YOU GO CHECK
ON THE OTHER GUYS?MM.

21:10.312 --> 21:13.663
[groaning and panting]

21:13.750 --> 21:17.754
HEY. CBI. YOU WANNA TELL ME
WHAT THE HELL YOU'RE DOING?

21:17.841 --> 21:22.019
FBI. I COULD ASK YOU
THE SAME THING.

21:27.895 --> 21:29.418
AGENT O'LAUGHLIN, IS IT?

21:29.505 --> 21:32.073
CRAIG O'LAUGHLIN.
THAT'S RIGHT, MA'AM.

21:32.160 --> 21:35.685
YOU WANNA TELL ME WHY THE FBI
WAS TAILING TWO OF MY AGENTS?

21:35.772 --> 21:38.645
SURE. WE'VE BEEN LOOKING
AT BRET STILES AND VISUALIZE

21:38.732 --> 21:41.082
FOR A COUPLE YEARS NOW.
AND WE'VE HAD ALLEGATIONS

21:41.169 --> 21:43.737
OF TAX FRAUD, RACKETEERING,
AND A LOT WORSE,

21:43.824 --> 21:46.827
BUT WE HAVEN'T FOUND ANYBODY
THAT COULD TELL US
ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION.

21:46.914 --> 21:49.264
TIGHT AS A DRUM.YEAH, BUT WHY FOLLOW US?

21:49.351 --> 21:52.180
MY BOSS THINKS STILES MAY HAVE
PEOPLE INSIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT,

21:52.267 --> 21:56.010
WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN
WHY WE'RE NOT GETTING ANYWHERE
WITH THE INVESTIGATION.

21:56.097 --> 21:58.447
YOU THINK THAT WE'RE WORKING
WITH VISUALIZE?

21:58.534 --> 22:01.189
SHE WANTED US TO LOOK INTO
THE POSSIBILITY. THAT'S ALL.

22:01.276 --> 22:04.758
AND I'VE SEEN
NO EVIDENCE OF IT.

22:04.845 --> 22:06.629
WHAT YOU DID WAS RECKLESS.

22:06.716 --> 22:09.023
I SHOULD BRING YOU UP
FOR DEPARTMENTAL DISCIPLINE.

22:09.110 --> 22:10.807
BUT HESHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
FOLLOWING YOU,

22:10.894 --> 22:14.071
SO I'M GONNA LET IT PASS.

22:14.158 --> 22:17.248
AND YOU TELL YOUR BOSS
IF SHE WANTS TO CATCH BAD GUYS,

22:17.336 --> 22:21.078
SHE SHOULD FOLLOW BAD GUYS.

22:21.165 --> 22:23.820
IT WAS A PLEASURE
WORKING WITH THE FBI.

22:23.907 --> 22:25.561
[scoffs]

22:25.648 --> 22:30.131
HEY, LISTEN. I'M SORRY
ABOUT THAT. DOES IT HURT?

22:30.218 --> 22:34.265
NO. NO, IT'S NOT THAT BAD.
THANKS.

22:34.353 --> 22:38.269
YOU KNOW,
VAN PELT...

22:38.357 --> 22:41.098
MM-HMM.YOU--YOU RELATED
TO AMOS VAN PELT, BY ANY CHANCE,

22:41.185 --> 22:43.187
THE FOOT-FOOTBALL COACH
AT BURTON?

22:43.274 --> 22:45.320
HE'S MY FATHER.

22:45.407 --> 22:48.192
WHOA. UH, HE WAS
ONE HELL OF A COACH.

22:48.279 --> 22:50.499
I WAS A WIDE RECEIVER
AT U. OF M.

22:50.586 --> 22:53.807
YOUR, UH, YOUR DAD GAVE US
ONE TOUGH GAME.

22:53.894 --> 22:55.286
O'LAUGHLIN...

22:55.374 --> 22:57.985
DIDN'T YOU GO NFL? TENNESSEE.

22:58.072 --> 23:00.291
I DID, YEAH.
YEAH, JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.511
THANKS FOR REMEMBERING.

23:02.598 --> 23:06.602
ANYWAY, I SHOULD GET BACK
TO THE OFFICE,
GET BEAT UP BY MY OWN BOSS.

23:06.689 --> 23:10.650
YOU SEE YOUR DAD,
TELL HIM HE'S REMEMBERED.

23:10.737 --> 23:12.782
I WILL. THANKS.

23:12.869 --> 23:14.393
YEAH.

23:18.832 --> 23:23.880
HEY. EXCUSE ME.
YOU'RE THE FBI GUY, RIGHT?

23:23.967 --> 23:27.971
I'M A SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE,
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN.THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN.

23:28.058 --> 23:31.279
SO YOU GUYS ARE INVESTIGATING
VISUALIZE AND THIS CHARACTER
BRET STILES, RIGHT?

23:31.366 --> 23:33.020
I GUESS THAT'S
COMMON KNOWLEDGE BY NOW.

23:33.107 --> 23:35.370
YEAH.

23:35.457 --> 23:38.678
DO YOU HAVE A GUY DEEP INSIDE
THE CHURCH, YOU KNOW,
UN-UNDERCOVER AGENT?

23:38.765 --> 23:40.854
YOU CAN'T SERIOUSLY
BE ASKING ME THAT.

23:40.941 --> 23:44.248
SO THAT'S A "YES."
ANY CHANCE OF A NAME?

23:44.335 --> 23:48.165
NO. NO CHANCE.

23:48.252 --> 23:49.906
WE HAVE TO GET BACK
TO VISUALIZE.

23:49.993 --> 23:51.734
WHY IS THAT?

23:51.821 --> 23:54.650
CELIA JOVANOVICH WAS ALMOST
CERTAINLY KILLED BY HER LOVER,

23:54.737 --> 23:57.218
SO SHE ALMOST CERTAINLY
MENTIONED HIS NAME

23:57.305 --> 23:58.654
IN HER VENT VIDEO.

23:58.741 --> 24:01.135
ERGO, WE NEED
TO SEE HER VIDEOS.

24:01.222 --> 24:03.529
I'LL GET MY COAT.

24:05.269 --> 24:09.143
WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN THERE?

24:09.230 --> 24:11.188
OH, LOOK AT THAT.
THANK YOU.

24:13.234 --> 24:16.019
"TO MAKE OURSELVES

WELL, ACTUALLY, I DID.
YOU GOT A MINUTE?

24:32.775 --> 24:34.690
WHAT IS IT, MR. JANE?

24:37.867 --> 24:39.565
YOU'RE THE FBI's
UNDERCOVER AGENT, RIGHT?

24:39.652 --> 24:40.827
WHAT?

24:40.914 --> 24:43.438
I NEED A FAVOR.
JUST A SMALL ONE.

POPPED THE BAG RIGHT NOW,

25:10.378 --> 25:12.336
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

25:12.423 --> 25:14.251
THIS IS
AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION,

MY WAY INTO THIS ORGANIZATION.

25:17.124 --> 25:20.823

I NEED ONE LITTLE THING.

25:21.824 --> 25:23.565
YOUR INVESTIGATION IS DEAD.

25:23.652 --> 25:26.655
IF I PICKED YOU OUT, THEN STILES
HAS DEFINITELY PICKED YOU OUT.

25:26.742 --> 25:29.440
THE ONLY REASON HE HASN'T
GOTTEN RID OF YOU IS BECAUSE

25:29.528 --> 25:32.835
HE'S USING YOU. HE'S FEEDING YOU
FALSE INFORMATION.

25:32.922 --> 25:35.621
DO YOU HAVE
ANY USABLE EVIDENCE?

25:35.708 --> 25:37.405
NO. DIDN'T THINK SO.

YOU CAN HELP ME, THOUGH.

CELIA JOVANOVICH'S KILLER.

WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

25:46.153 --> 25:48.416
I NEED TO SEE
ONE OF HER VENT VIDEOS,

WHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT
YOU WANTING CELIA'S VENT VIDEOS?

26:25.061 --> 26:28.543
WE BELIEVE CELIA JOVANOVICH
MAY HAVE IDENTIFIED HER KILLER
IN ONE OF THE VIDEOS.

26:28.630 --> 26:30.589
WE'D LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK
AT 'EM.

26:30.676 --> 26:33.200
NO, NO, NO. THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

26:35.550 --> 26:36.986
ONLY SENIOR MEMBERS
OF THE CHURCH

26:37.073 --> 26:38.292
ARE ALLOWED TO SEE THEM.

26:38.379 --> 26:40.599
I MEAN,
I COULD NO MORE SHOW YOU THEM

26:40.686 --> 26:44.167

A CONFESSION. HMM?

27:15.242 --> 27:16.939
IT'S BEEN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR.

27:17.026 --> 27:18.375
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.

27:18.462 --> 27:20.421
I'M GETTING BORED.

27:20.508 --> 27:24.033
MR. STILES IS CALLING IN
EVERY IMPORTANT PERSON HE KNOWS

27:24.120 --> 27:26.209
TO TRY AND GET US FIRED.

27:26.296 --> 27:27.820
IT TAKES TIME.

27:30.823 --> 27:32.825
AH.

27:32.912 --> 27:35.871
YOU'RE DONE. YOU ARE DONE.WE'VE SPOKEN
TO YOUR SUPERIORS,

27:35.958 --> 27:38.134
EXPLAINED TO THEM THAT
WE VIEW MR. JANE'S ACTIONS

27:38.221 --> 27:39.962
AS A GRIEVOUS BREACH
OF CIVIL LIBERTIES.

27:40.049 --> 27:43.139
WE'LL BE PURSUING CIVIL
AND CRIMINAL REMEDIES.MEH.

27:43.226 --> 27:44.967
I'M CURIOUS.

27:45.054 --> 27:49.145
YOU COULDN'T HOPE TO WATCH THESE
VIDEOS FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME.

27:49.232 --> 27:52.105
WHAT DID YOU THINK
YOU'D ACCOMPLISH BY COMING HERE?

27:52.192 --> 27:53.759
OH, WE'LL SEE THE VIDEOS.

27:53.846 --> 27:56.936
OH, YOU WILLSEE THEM, WILL YOU?
AND HOW IS THAT?

27:57.023 --> 27:58.328
YOU'LL GIVE THEM TO US.

27:58.415 --> 28:01.941
OH, REALLY? AND WHY? WHY?

28:09.513 --> 28:11.864
CELIA JOVANOVICH
WAS KILLED BY HER LOVER--

28:11.951 --> 28:14.170
SOMEONE VERY HIGH UP
IN YOUR CHURCH,

28:14.257 --> 28:17.086
SOMEONE THAT IS VERY PROBABLY
IN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW.

28:17.173 --> 28:20.568
WELL, THAT'S VERY INTERESTING,
IF IT WERE TRUE.

28:20.655 --> 28:24.224
AND I DARESAY, IS MENTIONED
IN HER VIDEOS.

28:24.311 --> 28:27.270
SO IF YOU SAY
YOU'LL GIVE US THE VIDEOS,

28:27.357 --> 28:29.577
THE KILLER
WILL IDENTIFY HIMSELF.

28:29.664 --> 28:31.927
HE WILL BE THE MAN
THAT INSISTS MOST FORCEFULLY

28:32.014 --> 28:35.104
THAT YOU SHOULDN'T GIVE 'EM
TO US.

28:35.191 --> 28:36.627
WHAT IF I KILLED HER?

28:36.715 --> 28:39.587
YOU?

28:39.674 --> 28:41.458
YOU WOULDN'T HURT A FLY.

28:41.545 --> 28:42.982
[chuckles]

28:46.202 --> 28:50.729
PATRICK HAS OFFERED
A VERY, UM, PERSUASIVE ARGUMENT.

28:50.816 --> 28:53.514
I'M GOING TO BE HANDING OVER
THE VIDEOS TO HIM.

28:53.601 --> 28:56.691
NO.

28:56.778 --> 28:58.606
NO. ABSOLUTELY N--
I-I CAN'T ALLOW THAT.

28:58.693 --> 29:01.827
WHY NOT?THE PRECEDENT
WOULD BE UNACCEPTABLE.

29:01.914 --> 29:05.047
IT WOULD OPEN UP ALL MANNER
OF INTRUSIVE POLICE ACTION.

29:05.134 --> 29:09.530
THAT SOUNDS LIKE LAWYER SPEAK
FOR "I DID IT. I DID IT.
I'M GUILTY."

29:09.617 --> 29:12.838
MR. COLES, IN A WEEK OR SO,
FORENSICS IS GONNA HAVE
PROCESSED

29:12.925 --> 29:15.623
THE D.N.A. THAT WAS UNDER
THE VICTIM'S FINGERNAILS.

29:15.710 --> 29:17.538
WE'RE GONNA NEED A SAMPLE
FROM YOU.

29:17.625 --> 29:20.062
THAT'S RIDICULOUS. THAT--
THAT IS COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY.

29:20.149 --> 29:22.282
NO, IT'S JUST A PINPRICK.
DOESN'T HURT A BIT.

29:22.369 --> 29:23.849
JULIUS, PLEASE.

29:23.936 --> 29:25.981
TELL ME...

29:26.068 --> 29:28.157
YOU DID NOT KILL...

29:28.244 --> 29:32.031
THAT YOUNG WOMAN.

29:32.118 --> 29:34.381
NO, I DIDN'T.

29:36.862 --> 29:40.082
THAT ONE--THAT--THAT
LOOKED LIKE IT DID HURT. HUH?

29:42.824 --> 29:44.260
SHE WAS A SWEET GIRL.

29:44.347 --> 29:46.567
I'D SEE HER
WHEN I CAME TO MEET BRET.

29:46.654 --> 29:49.831
SHE LIKED TO TALK ABOUT
THE BOOK SHE WAS READING.

29:49.918 --> 29:51.702
THINGS JUST WENT FROM THERE.

29:51.790 --> 29:54.096
I-I WAS...

29:54.183 --> 29:56.969
I WAS VERY FOND OF HER.

29:57.056 --> 29:59.972
AND THEN HERREN CAME
INTO THE PICTURE.

30:00.059 --> 30:02.235
CELIA SAID SHE HAD
TO TELL HERREN THE TRUTH...

30:02.322 --> 30:04.759
ABOUT US.

30:04.846 --> 30:07.153
I TOLD HER, VISUALIZE WAS
MY ONLY CLIENT.

30:07.240 --> 30:08.763
BRET WOULD BANISH ME

30:08.850 --> 30:13.899
IF HE KNEW I-I WAS INVOLVED
WITH A MEMBER.

30:13.986 --> 30:16.858
SHE JUST KEPT SAYING
SHE COULDN'T LIE.

30:16.945 --> 30:21.689
SHE COULDN'T LIE
TO SAVE MY CAREER.

30:21.776 --> 30:23.996
I GOT ANGRY.

30:24.083 --> 30:25.562
AND WE FOUGHT.

30:28.217 --> 30:29.740
IT HAPPENED.

30:36.095 --> 30:38.749
SO WE HAVE A DEAL?D.A. AGREED--

30:38.837 --> 30:42.101

INTO VISUALIZE AND BRET STILES.

30:49.804 --> 30:52.111
OKAY, YOU GOT IT.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.518
IT'S THE WAY OF THE WORLD.

31:08.605 --> 31:12.653
HE'S SELLING STILES. HE'S A BIG
FISH. THE FBI HAS TO PAY.

31:12.740 --> 31:16.657
IF YOU THINK ABOUT
THIS STUFF TOO MUCH,
YOU'LL DRIVE YOURSELF CRAZY.

31:57.219 --> 31:59.439
I STOLE IT FROM THE DESK
OF THE MANAGER.

31:59.526 --> 32:01.876
HE KEEPS IT
FOR MAKING NIGHT DEPOSITS.

32:01.963 --> 32:04.574
DID ANYONE ELSE KNOW
WHAT YOU WERE GONNA DO?

32:04.661 --> 32:06.968
PUT ME IN PRISON.
I DON'T CARE.

32:07.055 --> 32:09.188
MY HEART IS FREE.

32:09.275 --> 32:13.322
THE MINUTE I SAW HIM, I KNEW.
I DID THE RIGHT THING.

32:13.409 --> 32:16.238
DID ANYONE ELSE KNOW?

32:16.325 --> 32:17.283
NO.

32:17.370 --> 32:20.155

HERREN CONFESSED.

33:16.124 --> 33:18.300
HE DIDN'T MENTION YOUR NAME.

33:18.387 --> 33:21.042
THE POOR SOUL.

33:21.129 --> 33:24.959
BUT...
WHY WOULD HE MENTION ME?

33:25.046 --> 33:28.528
WELL... YOU DIDN'T GO
AND TELL HIM TO KILL THE MAN,

33:28.615 --> 33:30.486
BUT YOU CLARIFIED HIS OPTIONS,

33:30.573 --> 33:34.882
WHICH IS AS GOOD AS KILLING HIM,
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.

33:34.969 --> 33:37.189
IS THAT THE OFFICIAL VIEW?

33:37.276 --> 33:39.278
IS THIS WHY
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

33:39.365 --> 33:41.280

WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE.

A PUNCTURE WOUND IN

36:19.046 --> 36:21.527
MUST BE HOW HE
GOT THE BLOOD OUT OF HER.

HE ALSO SAID THERE WAS
NO OTHER SIGN OF ASSAULT--
PHYSICAL, SEXUAL, ANYTHING.

36:25.313 --> 36:28.534
WHY WON'T SHE SPEAK?
WHAT DID HE DO TO HER?

YOU'RE TALKING TO A GHOST
AND STILL YOU'RE A SKEPTIC.

40:01.050 --> 40:02.835
YOU ARE IMPOSSIBLE.

40:02.922 --> 40:05.707
YOU'RE NOT DEAD, KRISTINA.

40:05.794 --> 40:07.317
YOU'RE ALIVE.

40:07.405 --> 40:10.190
YOU'RE IN DENIAL.

40:10.277 --> 40:12.975
EVENTUALLY,
YOU'LL ACCEPT THE TRUTH.

40:13.062 --> 40:15.674
I KNOW IT'S HARD.

40:17.284 --> 40:19.895
GOD KNOWS I STRUGGLED
AGAINST IT MYSELF.

40:22.898 --> 40:27.337
BUT YOU CAN'T... FIGHT...
DEATH.

40:27.425 --> 40:30.123
HOW DID YOU DIE?

40:30.210 --> 40:33.300
I DON'T REMEMBER.

40:33.387 --> 40:36.521
IT'S FUNNY HOW THINGS
BECOME UNIMPORTANT.

40:37.783 --> 40:41.003
IT'S AS IF MY LIFE WAS
A DREAM.

40:41.090 --> 40:43.092
I WOKE UP.

40:43.179 --> 40:46.835
I CAN'T RECALL WHAT HAPPENED.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.797
DID YOU SEE RED JOHN?

40:53.363 --> 40:54.277
WHO?

40:54.364 --> 40:56.889
RED JOHN.

40:56.976 --> 41:00.588
RED JOHN--
THE MAN THAT ABDUCTED YOU.

41:04.331 --> 41:07.769
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

41:34.013 --> 41:37.756
OH. SURE.

41:41.368 --> 41:44.240
APPARENTLY, BRET STILES
IS OUT OF THE COUNTRY.

41:44.327 --> 41:46.721
HE'S OPENING A CENTER
IN JAKARTA.

41:46.808 --> 41:49.637
VISUALIZE PEOPLE SAY THEY DON'T
KNOW WHEN HE'LL BE BACK.

41:49.724 --> 41:53.162
HMM. FIGURES.HMM.

41:53.249 --> 41:55.164
BOSS. WE CAUGHT ONE.

41:55.251 --> 41:57.906
DOWNTOWN.

42:01.214 --> 42:03.477
ARE YOU OKAY?

42:05.392 --> 42:08.221
WE'RE UP. LET'S GO.

42:09.178 --> 42:11.572
