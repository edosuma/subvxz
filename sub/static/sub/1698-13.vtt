WEBVTT

00:01.470 --> 00:03.080
Hi, I'm Hannah Montana

00:03.100 --> 00:05.060
and I am on the set of my new Movie

00:05.100 --> 00:07.650
"Indiana Joannie and the Curse of the Golden Cobra"

00:07.760 --> 00:09.600
coming to a theatre near you this summer.

00:10.130 --> 00:12.070
Be there or be cursed.

00:12.470 --> 00:14.160
OW! Dang flabbit!

00:14.710 --> 00:16.190
Sorry Daddy!

00:16.790 --> 00:17.660
Cut!

00:18.380 --> 00:20.420
coming to a theatre near you this summer.

00:20.680 --> 00:23.100
Be there or be cursed... ah

00:25.370 --> 00:26.610
Cut!

00:27.010 --> 00:28.980
Be there or be cursed.

00:30.800 --> 00:31.960
Oh yeah!

00:32.420 --> 00:35.640
"Indiana Joannie and the Curse of the Golden Cobra"

00:36.320 --> 00:38.060
Hey, I'm back at the house.

00:38.060 --> 00:39.700
Where are you? Call me!

00:40.300 --> 00:41.610
Dad, can you believe this?

00:41.820 --> 00:42.680
I've been gone a month

00:42.680 --> 00:44.500
and Lilly and Oliver know I'm coming back today

00:44.660 --> 00:46.010
and nobody is picking up.

00:46.350 --> 00:48.070
How can they be so inconsiderate?

00:50.600 --> 00:52.470
Jee. I have no idea.

00:52.940 --> 00:54.840
It's sure not the way I brought you up.

00:55.500 --> 00:56.880
I know.

01:01.070 --> 01:02.360
Surprise!

01:02.460 --> 01:04.180
Lilly, Oliver.

01:04.250 --> 01:05.700
I thought you forgot about me.

01:07.010 --> 01:10.000
Don't anybody worry about 
helping me get to this door.

01:10.370 --> 01:11.990
Ha, I got it.

01:12.640 --> 01:16.960
Oh no. Please. Mr. Stewart can we
 help you with that luggage?

01:17.190 --> 01:19.510
Oh no. Kids, I got it!

01:19.590 --> 01:21.900
Are you sure, sir? It looks awfully heavy?

01:21.910 --> 01:24.900
Oh no y'all just enjoy your visit.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.500
So, how was the Movie?

01:29.500 --> 01:30.610
How was Chase Crawford?

01:30.670 --> 01:33.910
Amazing! and AMAA-ZING!

01:34.540 --> 01:35.950
So... eh, what have you guys been up to?

01:36.190 --> 01:38.940
Pff.. Wow, where do we begin?

01:38.950 --> 01:39.860
Yeah, eh...

01:39.870 --> 01:41.300
-I mean the beach...  -Yeah, the mall...

01:41.400 --> 01:42.610
-More beach  -More mall...

01:42.610 --> 01:44.290
And that one day, it almost rained!

01:44.300 --> 01:46.220
Oh, but it didn't and I took pictures. Here look.

01:46.300 --> 01:46.910
Crazy.

01:47.010 --> 01:49.300
Oh my beach! I missed it.

01:49.410 --> 01:52.920
I even kind of missed Rico's 
greasy overpriced nachos.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.210
Yeah, well go get changed then we head down

01:55.210 --> 01:56.600
and get sick to our stomachs together.

01:56.790 --> 01:58.480
Yep nothing says welcome home

01:58.480 --> 02:00.950
like a case of explosive nachos-rrhea.

02:02.480 --> 02:04.900
You two are disgusting.

02:06.400 --> 02:07.450
I missed that.

02:11.870 --> 02:13.040
How long you think she is gonna be?

02:13.370 --> 02:17.150
Mmmh... I don't know... 
Ten... fifteen minutes?

02:17.460 --> 02:18.670
You're thinking what I'm thinking?

02:20.000 --> 02:26.074

03:21.670 --> 03:24.110
You know... I still think we should tell Miley.

03:24.420 --> 03:26.930
And I still think she's going to 
get all wigged out Lillypop.

03:29.390 --> 03:30.850
You're being silly Olliepop

03:30.900 --> 03:32.450
she's gonna be happy that we're dating.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.300
Are you kidding?

03:34.450 --> 03:35.930
She's gonna think you've totally lost it.

03:36.100 --> 03:38.020
For the past three years I've been a cross

03:38.020 --> 03:40.250
between your guy friend and a pinata

03:57.660 --> 04:00.180
Yeah, good point. So ah... what do we do?

04:00.830 --> 04:03.650
Well I guess we have to
 ease her into it... you know.

04:03.830 --> 04:06.920
Ah you know sometimes I could say things like...

04:07.340 --> 04:09.460
"oh, doesn't Lilly look cute today?"

04:09.490 --> 04:11.260
and you know another time you could be like

04:11.640 --> 04:12.900
"wow, I've never really noticed it but

04:12.900 --> 04:14.840
Oliver looks like a Greek god."

04:16.079 --> 04:17.860
(Oh, disgusting.)

04:17.940 --> 04:18.970
OK, hang on...

04:18.970 --> 04:21.600
I get cute and you get Greek god?

04:23.160 --> 04:24.620
I need a little bit more help than you.

04:25.290 --> 04:27.590
Oh I love it when you get all humble.

04:29.300 --> 04:31.670
And you know, it's kinda nice 
that it's our little secret now.

04:32.060 --> 04:33.340
And it's not like she had a problem

04:33.340 --> 04:34.640
keeping her Hannah secret from us.

04:35.490 --> 04:37.360
Yeah, exactly. OK.

04:37.380 --> 04:38.390
So now it's our turn.

04:38.390 --> 04:39.730
-Yeah!  -Oh yeah!

04:39.850 --> 04:41.020
I love it when you 'oh yeah'!

04:41.190 --> 04:42.890
-Oh yeah!  -Oh!

04:47.990 --> 04:52.630
Eh... Yes... Eh... that sounds delightfully doable

04:52.640 --> 04:56.580
and splendily splendacious...

04:57.500 --> 04:58.100
Thank you!

04:58.920 --> 04:59.750
YES!

05:00.920 --> 05:02.340
Son, if that's a girl and she

05:02.340 --> 05:03.980
still wants to date you after that

05:03.990 --> 05:08.440
then I'm guessing she's not 
too stupendidly smartacious.

05:08.810 --> 05:10.580
For your information, that happened to be

05:10.580 --> 05:12.190
the state college of Santa Barbara

05:12.240 --> 05:14.140
setting up an interview with moi.

05:14.420 --> 05:16.010
Moi, moi, moi, moi, moi.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.180
I'd be a lot happier for you if

05:20.180 --> 05:22.330
you haven't just crashed moi sandwich.

05:22.690 --> 05:23.680
Sorry, dad.

05:26.390 --> 05:28.310
Huh? All better,

05:28.350 --> 05:30.130
see that's the sort of quick thinking that's gonna

05:30.150 --> 05:32.220
get me into the state college of Santa Barbara

05:32.360 --> 05:36.460
or as I like to call it Santa Babe-brah.

05:38.300 --> 05:40.710
Use that terminology during the interview

05:40.720 --> 05:42.320
and the only place you're gonna be going

05:42.320 --> 05:45.350
is "Santa Living home till you're fourty-ah!"

05:47.400 --> 05:48.870
Don't worry Dad. I mean

05:49.230 --> 05:51.690
sure I'm not good at the whole academics thing

05:51.690 --> 05:53.960
but face to face, I am unbeatable.

05:55.020 --> 05:56.540
Lets pretend you are the interviewer.

05:56.570 --> 05:57.950
Ask me why my grades have been...

05:57.950 --> 06:00.590
eh... what's, what's the word?

06:00.660 --> 06:01.930
Rotten?

06:02.790 --> 06:04.950
Miserable? Embarrassing?

06:06.060 --> 06:08.820
I said word. Nobody likes to show off.

06:09.960 --> 06:12.260
Look, to continue this will be my answer:

06:13.060 --> 06:16.030
"Eh, surely my grades could have been better.

06:16.300 --> 06:19.250
But that would have meant spending more time studying

06:19.260 --> 06:21.590
and less time running 'Jackson's kids',

06:22.320 --> 06:23.620
my charity for little ones

06:23.630 --> 06:25.450
who can't help themselves"

06:27.150 --> 06:28.570
So in other words, you're gonna lie.

06:28.810 --> 06:30.030
Like you on that couch

06:30.030 --> 06:31.730
during a Beverly Hillbillies marathon.

06:32.170 --> 06:33.920
I'm gonna say this one time.

06:34.310 --> 06:36.850
That darn show was an American classic.

06:38.300 --> 06:40.840
That's it? No big lecture about "how

06:40.940 --> 06:44.680
lying is bad" or "I'm only cheating myself?"

06:45.120 --> 06:47.930
Oh son, when you go away to college

06:48.160 --> 06:51.620
I'm not gonna be there to tell you what's right and wrong.

06:51.970 --> 06:54.520
You're gonna have to make those decisions for yourself.

06:54.810 --> 06:58.740
And you know what? I trust you to make the right ones,

06:58.760 --> 07:00.800
the ones that make your daddy proud.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.270
I love you, boy.

07:07.310 --> 07:09.710
I love you, boy. Blak!

07:10.200 --> 07:11.360
Come on, you're not gonna fall

07:11.360 --> 07:12.710
for that guilt garbage, are you?

07:12.760 --> 07:14.270
But he's your daddy.

07:14.270 --> 07:17.070
You don't want to break his heart, do you?

07:17.330 --> 07:19.660
Oh, come on, you're gonna listen to the guy that can't

07:19.660 --> 07:21.260
even remember to pull up his zipper?

07:24.400 --> 07:26.580
Made you look, he he!

07:26.840 --> 07:29.080
See? He's an idiot.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.160
You know what you gotta do!

07:31.790 --> 07:34.790
Just do it. Do it!

07:48.470 --> 07:50.900
Hey! They put onions on my burger!

07:52.600 --> 07:55.490
You know, it's how I would've been in the good old days

07:55.490 --> 07:56.620
but nope eh,

07:56.980 --> 07:58.290
no more wigged out for me.

07:58.790 --> 08:00.480
Really mature since the movie...

08:01.360 --> 08:02.750
Oh my gosh it's Brad Pitt!

08:02.810 --> 08:04.510
Oh, where, where?

08:05.780 --> 08:08.520
No, no just a Golden Retreiver on the hind legs sorry.

08:10.100 --> 08:13.470
Anyhoo, since my wigout days are over

08:13.510 --> 08:14.320
anything you wanna tell me

08:14.320 --> 08:17.200
girl to girl, best friend to best friend?

08:17.460 --> 08:20.090
Ah... Hey look Oliver is here with the drinks,

08:20.090 --> 08:21.430
boy have we missed you.

08:21.730 --> 08:23.190
Oh right. You know what?

08:23.460 --> 08:24.660
I forgot straws.

08:24.900 --> 08:26.800
No no no, we don't need straws.

08:26.920 --> 08:30.160
Arrr. Oliver you are so considerate, isn't he considerate?

08:30.330 --> 08:31.760
And he is cute, too.

08:31.800 --> 08:32.870
What?

08:33.490 --> 08:36.860
Yeah, you know being gone really opened my eyes.

08:36.870 --> 08:38.429
You are one cutie patootie.

08:38.530 --> 08:39.960
And you're no slouch either.

08:40.909 --> 08:44.590
You know what? You... you guys should date...

08:45.620 --> 08:47.660
and then not tell me about it.

08:51.580 --> 08:53.100
I think she knows.

08:54.740 --> 08:55.900
How did you find out?

08:56.000 --> 08:58.150
Maybe the next time you guys wanna keep a secret from me,

08:58.420 --> 08:59.800
y'all shouldn't have a spit-swap in

08:59.810 --> 09:02.300
the middle of my living room, Lilly-Pop.

09:03.430 --> 09:04.880
You see I told you she'd freak!

09:05.010 --> 09:07.850
I'm only freaking because you guys didn't tell me.

09:08.270 --> 09:09.660
I'm happy for you.

09:09.680 --> 09:12.060
Oh I knew you would be. See I told you.

09:12.080 --> 09:13.840
-She told me. She did.  -I did. I tell him.

09:14.600 --> 09:17.710
So um... how did it happen?

09:17.780 --> 09:20.290
OK well... we were at a beach party.

09:20.300 --> 09:22.630
Yeah. And uh... Nose Whistle Wallie was

09:22.630 --> 09:24.070
going to ask her to slow-dance.

09:24.150 --> 09:27.240
Yeah. So I grabbed Oliver before he could and

09:27.590 --> 09:31.170
you know it was just... the way my head fit into his neck...

09:31.740 --> 09:34.530
You know ah... her head smelt like apples.

09:35.980 --> 09:37.370
I like apples.

09:39.280 --> 09:41.190
Oh, so that means... whatever song you guys danced to...

09:41.190 --> 09:42.990
that's your song. What was it?

09:43.120 --> 09:44.290
-It was Radiohead.  -It was Coldplay.

09:47.010 --> 09:51.230
Ah... Oliver. It was Radiohead.

09:51.320 --> 09:55.790
Eh.. Lilly... it was definitely Coldplay.

09:56.910 --> 09:59.220
I think I would remember.

09:59.300 --> 10:02.590
I mean Radiohead is my favorite band.

10:02.760 --> 10:04.420
You know guys, it really doesn't matter.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.340
The main thing is that you guys are together.

10:06.410 --> 10:07.920
Yeah, hold on two seconds.

10:09.130 --> 10:12.900
Ah so, seriously you think 
Radiohead is better than Coldplay?

10:14.120 --> 10:16.280
Radioplay, Coldhead.

10:16.290 --> 10:19.320
The main thing is you guys are together. Right?

10:19.950 --> 10:22.060
So, where was your first date?

10:22.400 --> 10:24.820
-I took her to the movies.  -We went ice-skating!

10:25.420 --> 10:27.560
Did I say first date? I meant second.

10:27.750 --> 10:29.860
I cannot believe you don't remember our first date!

10:29.960 --> 10:32.750
I can't believe you think Radiohead is better than Coldplay!

10:32.780 --> 10:36.190
OK. Whatever you like, 12, let it go!

10:36.640 --> 10:39.910
Well excuse me for having an opinion.

10:40.180 --> 10:42.560
Yes, dear. Whatever you say, dear.

10:45.550 --> 10:48.590
Look. I'm sorry I bought it up. Who cares!

10:48.870 --> 10:51.100
You know what if you like Coldplay so much.

10:51.210 --> 10:52.330
They should be your girlfriend

10:52.330 --> 10:53.570
and you can take them skating.

10:53.570 --> 10:55.050
And then not remember it!

10:55.050 --> 10:56.680
Take them skating and not remember it?

10:56.680 --> 10:57.870
You know what? Who's twelve now!

10:57.890 --> 10:58.390
I'm still yet.

10:58.570 --> 11:01.310
Miley, would you please tell that one to grow up!

11:01.320 --> 11:04.630
That one? Wait, you forget my name now too!

11:04.630 --> 11:05.560
Come on, Miley. Let's go...

11:05.570 --> 11:06.450
No, I'm not going anywhere.

11:06.450 --> 11:07.560
Yeah, she's not going anywhere

11:07.560 --> 11:08.780
cause you're obviously wrong!

11:08.790 --> 11:11.140
I'll tell you what's wrong. When I picked you as a boyfriend.

11:11.190 --> 11:12.460
-Oh.  -You guys

11:13.180 --> 11:15.230
please stop fighting this is ridiculous!

11:15.610 --> 11:17.140
You know the sooner we just

11:17.140 --> 11:18.370
laugh about it and move on the better.

11:18.390 --> 11:20.310
I'll start. 

11:20.700 --> 11:23.760
You remember that time that you...

11:24.030 --> 11:25.030
Nothing!

11:26.410 --> 11:28.670
Alright, look. How about this. How about we um...

11:28.940 --> 11:31.830
recapture you know the moment of your first dance.

11:31.850 --> 11:35.740
You know snuggle, put your apples...

11:36.090 --> 11:38.520
No, forget it, OK? I'm outta here.

11:38.530 --> 11:39.710
Yeah, not before I am.

11:40.780 --> 11:43.550
All right! You guys are gonna get halfway home

11:43.600 --> 11:46.000
and realize how ridiculous this is!

11:46.060 --> 11:48.820
And when you do, I will be right here waiting for you.

11:50.230 --> 11:51.770
Right here!

11:57.740 --> 11:59.550
Honey, it's almost midnight. I don't think they'll be...

11:59.550 --> 12:01.200
They'll be back!

12:09.390 --> 12:11.340
This is ridiculous!

12:11.460 --> 12:12.800
They haven't talked in three days

12:12.800 --> 12:14.750
and they keep asking me to pick a side!

12:15.040 --> 12:16.960
-Well, I'm just...  -Freeze!

12:19.300 --> 12:20.070
Go ahead.

12:20.230 --> 12:22.450
I'm not gonna do it!

12:22.760 --> 12:24.750
Darling, I'm happy to feel your pain...

12:25.010 --> 12:27.320
I'm just glad my BLT didn't have to!

12:27.370 --> 12:29.860
BLT! See that's exactly what I'm talking about!

12:30.120 --> 12:32.900
The three of us were a classic combination

12:33.110 --> 12:35.060
but then, the lettuce decided...

12:35.130 --> 12:37.520
oh, I'm gonna go off I'm gonna go off and do a movie.

12:37.660 --> 12:38.970
buh-bye lettuce!

12:39.080 --> 12:42.560
And the bacon and the tomato 
decided they should be together

12:42.590 --> 12:45.030
Oh, I love you bacon pop! Yeah, 
I love you tomato pop!

12:45.090 --> 12:48.270
And then, the lettuce decided
 to finally come back home

12:48.270 --> 12:50.540
and they start arguing!

12:50.660 --> 12:53.130
Oh, bacon! Oh, tomato! Oh, no no no!

12:53.130 --> 12:56.100
And then I, the lettuce, I'm the
 lettuce I get in the middle!

12:56.100 --> 12:57.840
You know what I'm saying. I say don't fight!

12:57.870 --> 13:00.630
Don't fight! Don't fight!

13:01.610 --> 13:02.750
And now what have we got?

13:03.530 --> 13:05.460
Same thing I had last time.

13:05.540 --> 13:07.770
A real ugly looking sandwich.

13:08.430 --> 13:09.350
Exactly.

13:10.450 --> 13:11.370
Now, honey, listen.

13:11.380 --> 13:13.220
I'll admit they're being a little bit stubborn.

13:13.290 --> 13:14.990
But sometimes you've just got to be patient...

13:15.000 --> 13:16.700
let people work out their problems.

13:16.770 --> 13:19.310
Dad, when have I ever done that?

13:28.110 --> 13:30.210
Mr. Stewart? Katherine York.

13:30.460 --> 13:33.060
Oh, from the State College of Santa Babe-ra? Barbara!

13:33.410 --> 13:35.060
I don't know why I said that. It's not like

13:35.060 --> 13:38.570
I've ever heard my son ever
 say anything like that because

13:38.710 --> 13:41.640
he's very very serious about 
Santa Babe-ra. Barbara!

13:42.210 --> 13:43.500
It's OK, Mr. Stewart.

13:43.570 --> 13:44.700
A lot of parents are nervous at

13:44.700 --> 13:46.110
the beginning of the interview.

13:46.190 --> 13:48.230
But let me assure you by the end...

13:48.420 --> 13:50.170
it's much worse.

13:51.760 --> 13:56.950
I'm kidding! No, it'll be fine.

13:57.510 --> 14:01.270
Well, listen, I feel a lot better now and

14:01.330 --> 14:03.960
thank you so much for coming out here it's...

14:04.020 --> 14:05.400
Aren't you forgetting something?

14:05.630 --> 14:08.910
About eighteen... male... probably calls you 'dad'.

14:09.560 --> 14:11.650
-Oh! The boy!  -Yeah!

14:11.760 --> 14:14.060
Yeah, the boy. Let me just go and get him. OK.

14:14.410 --> 14:15.470
Jackson!

14:16.060 --> 14:16.890
Come on in.

14:17.540 --> 14:18.220
Now!

14:20.350 --> 14:21.400
-Hi.  -Hi.

14:21.440 --> 14:22.080
I'm Jackson.

14:22.200 --> 14:23.620
-Nice to meet you.  -Nice to meet you.

14:23.740 --> 14:25.650
First I just want to say thank you so much

14:25.650 --> 14:27.750
for driving all the way down from Santa Barbara.

14:27.900 --> 14:30.310
Babe-ra! Oh, sweet niblets!

14:31.710 --> 14:32.860
Hey, Jackson!

14:33.660 --> 14:35.450
We've been collecting trash off the beach.

14:35.450 --> 14:36.690
Just like you taught us.

14:36.720 --> 14:39.510
And now we're gonna separate papers and plastics.

14:40.820 --> 14:41.990
That's great, guys.

14:42.050 --> 14:43.830
Hey, after my interview, we'll go over

14:43.830 --> 14:46.350
earthquake preparedness and CPR!

14:46.620 --> 14:48.040
Yeah!

14:48.100 --> 14:49.530
Now run along guys. Come on.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.730
See. That's what it is all about.

14:55.730 --> 14:58.520
Helping shape tomorrow's future today.

14:58.660 --> 15:00.300
Now I may not have an A in Science.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.540
But I have an A where it counts.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.630
In here.

15:05.470 --> 15:07.550
It's very altruistic of you.

15:09.280 --> 15:10.500
Aha.

15:11.900 --> 15:15.240
Mrs. York. Why don't you make yourself comfortable

15:15.260 --> 15:15.910
and Jackson

15:15.910 --> 15:18.030
if I could just speak with you over here for a moment.

15:18.100 --> 15:18.950
Just me and you.

15:19.010 --> 15:20.450
Of course, father.

15:20.790 --> 15:23.750
Respect for the wisdom and council of those who love us.

15:23.870 --> 15:26.400
A lesson I'd try to teach my kids.

15:30.550 --> 15:32.760
Look, Dad, I know you want me to tell the truth

15:32.760 --> 15:34.470
but you also want me to get into college.

15:34.480 --> 15:35.980
It's time to make a choice!

15:36.010 --> 15:38.560
Well it's pretty obvious you've already made yours!

15:38.900 --> 15:40.810
Now I'm just gonna say this one time.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.970
Your mother would not be very proud of you today.

15:44.190 --> 15:46.410
Oh! The mom card!

15:46.800 --> 15:48.330
Oh, that's low.

15:48.490 --> 15:50.580
Well if you're going to play hard ball so am I.

15:51.960 --> 15:54.050
Good luck with the interview, son.

15:57.370 --> 15:59.850
So eh, where were we?

16:01.090 --> 16:04.590
Well, Jackson why don't you tell me a little bit more

16:04.590 --> 16:07.330
about the work you do with the Youth of Tomorrow.

16:07.440 --> 16:09.150
Yes, my work! Argh...

16:09.640 --> 16:10.780
where do I begin?

16:11.790 --> 16:13.730
I think the first thing you should know is...

16:14.630 --> 16:15.850
argh...

16:16.240 --> 16:18.400
the first thing you should know is...

16:21.110 --> 16:22.160
the truth.

16:23.430 --> 16:27.010
I am a lazy... lying underachiever.

16:27.360 --> 16:30.050
I hired those kids. I don't know CPR!

16:30.060 --> 16:31.510
And if there was an earthquake right now...

16:31.580 --> 16:32.800
I'd probably use your body

16:32.800 --> 16:34.810
to shield myself from falling debree.

16:34.850 --> 16:35.980
He would too!

16:37.730 --> 16:39.800
I mean he'd probably feel bad about it later...

16:40.090 --> 16:41.740
but he's telling you the truth.

16:41.880 --> 16:44.090
And I have never been so proud of you, son.

16:44.770 --> 16:46.140
You know, Jackson,

16:46.140 --> 16:49.390
you are the most honest young man I have ever interviewed.

16:49.660 --> 16:52.660
And that is a very impressive quality.

16:53.500 --> 16:54.940
So I've still got a shot?

16:54.960 --> 16:58.900
Honestly... one in ten thousand.

17:00.300 --> 17:01.720
Yes!

17:02.030 --> 17:05.450
One in ten thousand, baby. Whoa!

17:08.400 --> 17:10.030
He's not that good at math either.

17:22.770 --> 17:25.950
OK, fine! You don't get any of my nachos!

17:26.760 --> 17:29.080
Can you believe him trying to bribe you with nachos?

17:29.100 --> 17:30.670
By the way, I saved you my curly fries

17:30.670 --> 17:32.420
because I know they're your favorites

17:32.520 --> 17:34.830
just like I am. I'm her favorite!

17:34.870 --> 17:35.860
Whoa!

17:36.980 --> 17:39.380
Lilly, no need to rub it in. We're above that.

17:39.400 --> 17:41.590
-No, we're not!  -Lilly!

17:42.950 --> 17:45.330
Fine. But only because you chose me.

17:45.860 --> 17:47.450
And I'm also choosing you to come and

17:47.450 --> 17:49.830
see the very first rough cut of Indianna Joannie.

17:49.870 --> 17:51.300
No way! That's going to be great!

17:51.310 --> 17:53.270
I know. But argh...

17:53.560 --> 17:56.170
I should probably go tell Oliver why I chose you.

17:56.290 --> 17:57.950
He at least deserves that right?

17:57.960 --> 17:59.410
Y'OK. But...

17:59.770 --> 18:01.490
while you're over there, can you
 give him a message for me?

18:01.490 --> 18:03.790
I'm not going to tell him he is eventually going to die, sad

18:03.790 --> 18:05.050
and alone, calling out your name.

18:07.260 --> 18:09.200
Well then never mind.

18:11.340 --> 18:12.230
Hey, Max.

18:13.240 --> 18:15.040
I'll give you ten bucks to go tell Lilly that

18:15.050 --> 18:16.790
she just got voted girl with the ugliest ears

18:16.790 --> 18:17.910
in all Seaview High history.

18:18.270 --> 18:21.280
Give me twenty and I'll tell her 
se has a squeaky voice too!

18:22.620 --> 18:23.620
Oh, what the heck!

18:25.470 --> 18:26.400
Hey.

18:26.660 --> 18:28.920
You're not getting any of my nachos traitor.

18:31.190 --> 18:33.870
I am not a traitor! I chose you.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.720
Then why were you talking to Lilly?

18:35.820 --> 18:39.760
Because I mean I had to tell her why I chose you.

18:40.240 --> 18:41.520
She at least deserves that.

18:41.880 --> 18:42.700
Really?

18:43.060 --> 18:46.540
Yeah. I mean. Look at her.

18:47.500 --> 18:51.260
No! No!

18:51.990 --> 18:54.610
Whoa. You really did pick me

18:54.610 --> 18:56.320
I mean over your best girl friend!

18:56.810 --> 18:59.580
I mean you guys share you know feelings,

18:59.580 --> 19:00.960
facials and shoes!

19:02.860 --> 19:07.190
Man! I must be awesome!

19:14.940 --> 19:18.200
Oh! I smell popcorn!

19:18.260 --> 19:19.200
Miley?

19:19.780 --> 19:21.190
Oh I smell...

19:21.310 --> 19:22.280
YOU!

19:24.250 --> 19:27.700
What are you doing here! She chose me! Miley!

19:28.710 --> 19:29.820
Alright, that's it. I'm outta here...

19:33.410 --> 19:35.210
Nobody's going anywhere!

19:39.540 --> 19:42.740
I have a whip. And I have no idea how to use it!

19:42.990 --> 19:44.320
Now sit down.

19:47.930 --> 19:49.190
Miley what are you...

19:49.240 --> 19:52.310
Please! No talking during our feature presentation!

19:52.950 --> 19:58.030
Indianna Joannie and the Curse of the Stupid Annoying Friends!

20:00.700 --> 20:02.120
-What is this this is not...  
-Why are we watching this...

20:02.160 --> 20:03.500
Take some popcorn at it!

20:05.600 --> 20:08.260
Well we were at this beach party...

20:08.610 --> 20:12.380
And Nose Whistle Wallie was about to ask her to dance.

20:12.800 --> 20:17.040
And so I grabbed Oliver before he could and well it was

20:17.330 --> 20:20.620
just the way my head fit into his neck.

20:22.240 --> 20:25.200
Yeah. And her hair smelled like apples.

20:26.510 --> 20:28.030
I like apples!

20:29.110 --> 20:31.480
And then we danced...

20:31.490 --> 20:34.200
To argh... a song by Coldplay.

20:36.190 --> 20:40.520
Oliver, honey. It was Radiohead!

20:40.790 --> 20:43.500
I mean I think I would remember my favorite band.

20:44.140 --> 20:47.660
You honestly think Radiohead is better than Coldplay?

20:47.930 --> 20:49.800
Well, if you like Coldplay so much

20:49.800 --> 20:52.410
maybe they should be your girlfriend!

20:52.500 --> 20:54.340
Oh, maybe they should be my girlfriend...

20:59.520 --> 21:01.210
Now this is what should've happened.

21:02.660 --> 21:06.480
So wait, you honestly think 
Radiohead is better than Coldplay?

21:08.570 --> 21:11.170
Ha. Isn't it cool that we can still like

21:11.170 --> 21:13.320
each other even though we like different music?

21:13.680 --> 21:15.750
So true!

21:15.960 --> 21:20.130
I mean we have been friends since like kindergarten...

21:22.460 --> 21:24.820
Do you really wanna throw that all away

21:24.820 --> 21:26.710
over some silly little fight?

21:28.380 --> 21:29.730
Well, do you?

21:30.650 --> 21:33.720
Look. I don't know if you're meant to be a couple.

21:34.350 --> 21:36.060
But I do know you're meant to be friends.

21:36.510 --> 21:38.130
And please I do not want to watch

21:38.130 --> 21:40.000
you throw that away over this fight.

21:41.330 --> 21:42.250
She's right.

21:43.140 --> 21:44.140
Yeah, I know.

21:44.940 --> 21:46.040
I'm sorry.

21:46.900 --> 21:48.080
Me too.

21:48.190 --> 21:49.450
I missed you Ollie-pop!

21:49.710 --> 21:51.370
I missed you too Lilly-Pop!

21:52.270 --> 21:53.650
OK!

21:54.680 --> 21:56.910
I'm cool with the whole 
boyfriend girlfriend thing.

21:57.300 --> 21:59.480
Not loving the whole kissy pop. OK?

22:05.970 --> 22:07.350
Hey, Miley, thank you.

22:07.600 --> 22:08.390
You're welcome.

22:08.430 --> 22:09.530
You're the best friend ever.

22:09.540 --> 22:10.510
Yes, I am.

22:10.530 --> 22:12.220
-This is a little weird for you, huh? 
 -Yes, it is.

22:12.290 --> 22:13.960
-We should go, huh?  
-Yes, you should.

22:13.970 --> 22:14.770
We're out!

22:18.000 --> 22:20.830
Coldplay. Radiohead.

22:20.830 --> 22:24.100
