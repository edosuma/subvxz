WEBVTT

00:14.614 --> 00:17.016
(panting)

00:17.018 --> 00:19.118
(pop music playing
over headphones)

00:31.297 --> 00:34.533
(panting)

01:13.440 --> 01:14.573
(camera shutter clicking)

01:20.513 --> 01:24.149
(camera shutter clicking)

01:24.151 --> 01:25.517
All right, ducky,
I'm done.

01:25.519 --> 01:27.586
Thank you, tim.

01:28.788 --> 01:30.622
(groans)

01:30.624 --> 01:33.525
You poor dear.

01:34.694 --> 01:37.529
Probably didn't even
hear it coming.

01:38.631 --> 01:40.632
Hey, where's tony?

01:40.634 --> 01:42.334
I don't know.

01:42.336 --> 01:43.435
I offered
to give him a lift,

01:43.437 --> 01:45.437
But he said someone
would pick him up.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.172
From dc to quantico?

01:47.174 --> 01:48.707
Sounded strange
to me, too.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.676
I don't know how he's
surviving without a car.

01:50.678 --> 01:52.211
(phone beeps)

01:52.213 --> 01:54.246
Is that him?

01:54.248 --> 01:56.348
No. It's delilah.

01:56.350 --> 01:58.317
We're talking about sneaking
away for a long weekend.

01:58.319 --> 01:59.518
(laughs):
Nice.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.453
Ducky:
If you hens are finished,

02:01.455 --> 02:03.288
I could do with some help.

02:03.290 --> 02:05.390
Oh, yes.

02:05.392 --> 02:07.593
Her name's petty officer
third class jody ray.

02:07.595 --> 02:09.795
Patrol spotted her body
just after sunrise.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.430
She works
at the base clinic.

02:11.432 --> 02:13.332
Punched out just after
2100 last night.

02:13.334 --> 02:14.700
And she went for a run?

02:14.702 --> 02:17.336
Coworker said she was training
for a marathon.

02:17.338 --> 02:19.638
Had been running almost every
night for the past few months.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.173
Next of kin been notified?

02:21.175 --> 02:22.608
Caco team is on it, sir.

02:22.610 --> 02:24.776
All right, thanks.

02:27.547 --> 02:30.449
Nice of you to join us, dinozzo.

02:30.451 --> 02:31.817
Yeah, sorry.

02:31.819 --> 02:34.520
Hey, jimmy.

02:35.722 --> 02:38.590
So, what did I miss?

02:41.327 --> 02:43.462
Who was it that drove you
all the way over here?
Oh.

02:43.464 --> 02:44.897
A friend.

02:44.899 --> 02:46.598
No, seriously.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.933
Seriously.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.801
What should I do, photograph?

02:49.803 --> 02:51.270
No, I already did it.

02:51.272 --> 02:54.206
Egh. All right.

02:54.208 --> 02:56.608
Duck?

02:56.610 --> 02:59.178
Last night, 2200 hours,

02:59.180 --> 03:01.346
Or thereabouts.

03:13.826 --> 03:15.494
Mcgee:
Hey, abbs.

03:15.496 --> 03:17.196
Come up with anything?

03:17.198 --> 03:18.597
Making progress.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.766
Look, okay, this is a part

03:20.768 --> 03:23.402
Of the vehicle's
headlight assembly.

03:23.404 --> 03:24.603
What's the make and model?

03:25.572 --> 03:27.206
There are 47 manufacturers

03:27.208 --> 03:29.474
Of cars and trucks
in the United States.

03:29.476 --> 03:32.477
Each one of those produces
multiple models and body styles.

03:32.479 --> 03:34.379
And the parts and the trim
are redesigned every few years.

03:34.381 --> 03:35.747
There are zillions
of possibilities.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.583
Why would anyone assume
that I could take

03:37.585 --> 03:39.551
A teeny, tiny
piece of plastic

03:39.553 --> 03:41.587
And easily identify a vehicle?

03:41.589 --> 03:42.955
What's the make and model?

03:42.957 --> 03:47.559
A 2003 to a 2005 dodge ram
pickup truck.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.328
Thank you very much.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.696
But we're going
to have to narrow it down.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.497
There's hundreds of trucks
on that base every day.

03:52.499 --> 03:54.299
That's what I was doing
when you interrupted me.

03:54.301 --> 03:56.902
So, there was a trace
of the vehicle's paint

03:56.904 --> 03:59.504
On petty officer ray's watch.

03:59.506 --> 04:00.639
These are our color choices.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.574
On the top
we have inferno red.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.509
And the bottom we have
deep molten red.

04:04.511 --> 04:05.777
I don't know who comes up
with these names.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.546
What do you think?

04:07.548 --> 04:09.982
I'm going to have to
go with the top one.
Agreed.

04:09.984 --> 04:14.953
So inferno red was only
available between 2005 and 2008.

04:14.955 --> 04:17.589
So the only year in common
between the headlight lens

04:17.591 --> 04:19.658
And the color is 2005.

04:19.660 --> 04:24.496
Ergo we are looking for a red
2005 dodge ram pickup truck.

04:24.498 --> 04:25.797
Abby, you are the best.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.532
Still taken for granted.

04:27.534 --> 04:30.669
Just 'cause I make it look easy
doesn't mean it is.

04:30.671 --> 04:33.538
Why do you suspect
staff sergeant justin dunne?

04:33.540 --> 04:35.374
Abby I.D.'d the make, model
and color

04:35.376 --> 04:36.842
Of the hit-and-run vehicle.

04:36.844 --> 04:39.645
Only one registered on base
and it belongs to dunne.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.413
I checked the gate
security footage.

04:41.415 --> 04:42.814
His truck never left
quantico last night.

04:42.816 --> 04:45.284
What do we know about him?
Single.

04:45.286 --> 04:46.718
Joined the corps
right out of high school.

04:46.720 --> 04:47.719
He's a helo mechanic.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.454
Scheduled to deploy on an lha

04:49.456 --> 04:50.756
To the med, later this week.

04:50.758 --> 04:53.525
And most pertinent...

04:53.527 --> 04:55.060
He has a dui in his past.

04:58.931 --> 05:01.633
(laughs):
I love it when it all comes
together so quickly.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.568
Not me.
Makes me nervous.

05:03.570 --> 05:04.903
Too easy.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.772
Let's go.

05:06.774 --> 05:09.341
You ever going to
get a new car?

05:09.343 --> 05:11.576
Well, firstly,
I never buy new cars.

05:11.578 --> 05:14.313
Secondly, I need something
that ignites my passions.

05:14.315 --> 05:15.647
It's like a woman.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.683
I need to be in love
before I commit.

05:17.685 --> 05:20.419
You've never committed
to a woman.

05:24.991 --> 05:27.926
(pounding on door)

05:27.928 --> 05:29.695
Sergeant dunne. Ncis.

05:31.631 --> 05:33.565
(pounding on door)

05:33.567 --> 05:35.701
Tony:
Sergeant dunne!

05:40.840 --> 05:43.542
Freeze. Ncis.

05:52.085 --> 05:53.919
Yeah, that's my truck, but

05:53.921 --> 05:56.355
I swear, I don't know how
it got that way.

05:56.357 --> 05:58.557
You didn't drive it
last night?
No.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.125
I haven't used the truck
in a couple of days.

06:00.127 --> 06:03.395
How do you get to work?
I walk.
Need the exercise.

06:03.397 --> 06:05.764
The maintenance bay isn't
that far from my quarters.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.366
Tony:
Where were you last
night, 2200 hours?

06:07.368 --> 06:10.001
I was in my room... Asleep.

06:10.003 --> 06:11.636
Had a tough week.

06:11.638 --> 06:12.971
I was exhausted.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.139
You sure you weren't drunk

06:14.141 --> 06:16.475
And you just don't
remember what you did?

06:16.477 --> 06:18.143
We know about your dui.

06:18.145 --> 06:20.445
I've been sober for 13 months.

06:20.447 --> 06:22.447
I go to three or four
meetings a week.

06:22.449 --> 06:25.016
So, if you weren't driving the
pickup and you're innocent,

06:25.018 --> 06:26.852
Why were you climbing
out a window?

06:29.922 --> 06:32.090
I know my rights.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.559
I'm not saying any more
until I have a lawyer.
Okay.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.862
Then you can have
the lawyer of your choice

06:36.864 --> 06:40.031
Or jag will assign
one to you.

06:40.033 --> 06:43.101
(door opens and closes)

06:43.103 --> 06:44.603
(sighs)

06:44.605 --> 06:45.904
Hey, mcgee.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.639
Did you bring me
sergeant dunne's right boot?

06:47.641 --> 06:50.876
Sorry, abbs, he lawyered up and
didn't give a permissive search.

06:50.878 --> 06:53.979
Hmm. Well, did you get
a good look at his feet?

06:53.981 --> 06:56.481
Huh?
Well, the footprint
that you cast

06:56.483 --> 06:59.484
At the crime scene, it's a
standard-issue marine corps

06:59.486 --> 07:00.719
Combat boot,
size ten and a half.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.654
Well, I guess
he might wear that size.

07:02.656 --> 07:04.556
It's well worn
and has a very distinctive gash

07:04.558 --> 07:05.957
In the right heel.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.627
I'd just really love to match it
to sergeant dunne.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.162
Well, you're going to have
to wait till morning.

07:10.164 --> 07:11.663
Any luck here?

07:11.665 --> 07:14.199
Oh, this is definitely
the pickup truck.

07:14.201 --> 07:16.868
The tires match the tracks
that were in the dirt.

07:16.870 --> 07:19.638
And I got hair, blood
and clothing fibers

07:19.640 --> 07:21.573
Off the front end
that match our victim.

07:21.575 --> 07:23.642
So, I'll get dna confirmation
in the morning,

07:23.644 --> 07:25.043
And we should have it
locked up.

07:25.045 --> 07:28.513
Great.

07:29.982 --> 07:31.750
Hey, have you been giving
tony rides to work

07:31.752 --> 07:33.452
Since his car was wrecked?

07:33.454 --> 07:34.853
No.

07:34.855 --> 07:35.987
Hmm.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.622
Somebody dropped him off

07:37.624 --> 07:39.558
All the way out at quantico
this morning.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.059
Is he dating someone?

07:41.061 --> 07:44.529
Oh... I don't think so.

07:44.531 --> 07:46.998
Hmm.

07:48.201 --> 07:50.035
(inhales deeply, sighs)

07:50.037 --> 07:51.903
You always smell so great.

07:51.905 --> 07:54.039
Let me guess-- you missed
the sexual harassment meeting

07:54.041 --> 07:55.707
Again this year.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.809
Hey, everybody, look
who I found in the lobby.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.077
Gibbs:
Hey, clark.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.246
Hey, guys.
Mcgee:
Morning, carrie.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.615
I don't think
I've had the pleasure.

08:03.617 --> 08:06.952
Meet former fbi
agent carrie clark.

08:06.954 --> 08:07.953
Now in private law practice.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.154
Nice to meet you, doctor.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.956
Likewise.
Tony:
Carrie worked

08:10.958 --> 08:12.824
The norfolk side
of the port authority case

08:12.826 --> 08:14.826
A few years ago,
made fornell look good.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.027
It was a tough job.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.596
No, you guys made it easy.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.598
I don't remember
that case.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.966
Grand theft, ducky,

08:20.968 --> 08:22.868
No autopsy, no body, no you.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.102
Ah.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.270
What brings
you to ncis?

08:25.272 --> 08:26.872
I'm here to see
sergeant dunne.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.041
You're his lawyer?

08:30.043 --> 08:32.544
Say it ain't so.
Yes, where is he?

08:32.546 --> 08:34.813
Staff sergeant dunne's in a
holding cell across the yard.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.982
Agent mcgee can
take you to him.
Thank you.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.049
Good to see you guys.

08:40.653 --> 08:42.587
Bye.
Duck,

08:42.589 --> 08:44.689
You can release petty officer
ray's body any time

08:44.691 --> 08:45.957
You're ready.

08:45.959 --> 08:48.126
You notice anything different
about carrie, boss?

08:48.128 --> 08:49.661
No wedding ring.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.062
Told you the husband
was a handbag.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.865
Handbag?

08:53.867 --> 08:56.101
Something useless
you hang on your arm.

08:56.103 --> 08:58.270
Oh.
(chuckles)

08:58.272 --> 09:00.305
Hey, agent fornell,
it's dinozzo.

09:00.307 --> 09:03.108
Listen, can you give me
the skinny

09:03.110 --> 09:05.176
On the ever-fetching
carrie clark?

09:20.793 --> 09:23.695
Hello.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.096
I'm carrie clark.

09:25.098 --> 09:26.831
Didn't expect you
to look like you do.

09:26.833 --> 09:28.833
Is that a problem?

09:28.835 --> 09:30.669
Not if you're as good
as my cousin said.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.904
Well, I haven't had
any complaints.

09:34.907 --> 09:37.842
You're about to be arraigned
on some very serious charges.

09:37.844 --> 09:39.911
I don't know anything
about a hit-and-run.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.080
If it was my pickup,
someone else was driving.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.882
Any idea who?

09:46.352 --> 09:48.920
Justin, I want to believe you,
but you seem very nervous.

09:48.922 --> 09:52.190
Is there something
that you want to tell me?

09:55.094 --> 09:57.095
Where were you
at 10:00 last night?

09:58.097 --> 10:00.298
Doesn't matter.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.733
Of course it does.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.201
I have an alibi.
Okay.

10:03.203 --> 10:04.703
That's all you
need to know.

10:04.705 --> 10:07.272
Are you going to tell me?

10:12.144 --> 10:15.680
(chuckling):
All right, if that is going
to be your attitude,

10:15.682 --> 10:18.216
Jag will assign someone
to you for free.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.284
Hold on.

10:20.953 --> 10:22.887
Could this room
be bugged?

10:22.889 --> 10:25.156
No, no way--
that would be illegal.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.125
Are you recording
our conversation?

10:27.127 --> 10:28.660
No.

10:28.662 --> 10:29.894
You're my lawyer.

10:29.896 --> 10:32.297
Anything I say, you
can't tell anyone?

10:32.299 --> 10:34.065
It's called
attorney-client privilege.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.834
Everything that you say
is confidential.

10:35.836 --> 10:38.870
It doesn't leave this room
unless you want it to.

10:38.872 --> 10:42.240
From telling anyone
what we discuss.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.842
You sure?

10:44.844 --> 10:46.945
I promise you, justin.

10:51.717 --> 10:53.385
When that girl was killed,

10:53.387 --> 10:56.888
I was 35 miles away
in falls church.

10:57.757 --> 10:59.758
And what
were you doing there?

11:02.962 --> 11:05.030
Stabbing a guy to death.

11:10.803 --> 11:12.804
Why are you checking
airline schedules?

11:12.806 --> 11:14.773
Miami?

11:14.775 --> 11:15.974
Do you have
to know everything?

11:15.976 --> 11:18.410
Yes, it's in my dna.

11:18.412 --> 11:22.247
Well, you're gonna drive me
crazy until I tell you, so...

11:22.249 --> 11:25.083
Things are quiet here,
this case is wrapping up.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.751
I've got
a few vacation days coming,

11:26.753 --> 11:28.186
So delilah and I
have been talking

11:28.188 --> 11:30.121
About getting away
for a long weekend.

11:30.123 --> 11:32.791
Mcgee, I'm impressed.

11:32.793 --> 11:36.294
Miami, south beach,
hot clubs, stone crabs.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.096
It is unlike you.

11:38.098 --> 11:41.166
I knew I shouldn't
have said anything.

11:42.134 --> 11:44.302
Tony:
Oh.

11:44.304 --> 11:45.870
That didn't take long.

11:45.872 --> 11:46.938
Your client come
to his senses?

11:46.940 --> 11:48.273
Thank you.
Wants to confess?

11:48.275 --> 11:49.808
No.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.376
Wants to make
a deal, then?

11:51.378 --> 11:53.311
Sergeant dunne says
he's innocent.

11:53.313 --> 11:57.282
We've forensically tied
his pickup to the victim.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.818
He ran when we tried
to question him.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.352
He claims he
has an alibi.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.254
Well, what is it?
We'll check it out.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.724
Well, it is not
that simple, gibbs,

12:05.726 --> 12:06.791
He told me in
confidence.

12:06.793 --> 12:08.193
It's privileged.

12:08.195 --> 12:09.294
If he doesn't want
to tell you himself,

12:09.296 --> 12:10.962
Then my hands
are tied.

12:10.964 --> 12:13.431
We've got 48 hours to either
charge him or let him go.

12:16.836 --> 12:18.303
Give us something.

12:18.305 --> 12:22.307
All right, listen, I will go
check out his alibi myself

12:22.309 --> 12:24.142
And I will get back to you.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.781
The guy's facing
vehicular homicide

12:29.783 --> 12:31.216
And hit-and-run charges.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.817
He won't use an alibi?

12:32.819 --> 12:34.886
Is he crazy?

12:47.800 --> 12:49.467
Abbs.

12:49.469 --> 12:53.204
Gibbs... You're amazing.

12:55.908 --> 12:57.442
How did you know that someone
else was driving the truck?

12:57.444 --> 12:59.377
What'd you find?

12:59.379 --> 13:01.079
Well, it's more what I didn't
find that's interesting.

13:01.081 --> 13:03.114
I mean, before you
called, I was just trying

13:03.116 --> 13:05.984
To match the victim to
the vehicle, which I did.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.252
But?
But then, when
you asked me

13:07.254 --> 13:08.787
If there's a chance
that someone

13:08.789 --> 13:11.156
Other than the owner of
the truck was driving,

13:11.158 --> 13:13.291
I dusted the whole thing for
prints, I didn't find any.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.493
Just staff sergeant dunne's?
No.

13:15.495 --> 13:19.264
I mean, like none, nada,
zip, zilch, nothing.

13:19.266 --> 13:21.132
Almost the entire
surface of the truck

13:21.134 --> 13:23.101
Was wiped clean
of fingerprints--

13:23.103 --> 13:24.502
The door handle, the steering
wheel, the gearshift,

13:24.504 --> 13:27.939
The seat adjuster,
everything.

13:29.275 --> 13:31.976
Now, I got reminded
o-of my uncle horace.

13:31.978 --> 13:35.580
Like his glasses and
his wallet and his keys.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.248
He got locked out of his
own car so many times

13:37.250 --> 13:40.118
That he, he hid
a key on his car.

13:40.120 --> 13:44.122
And then I found... This...

13:44.124 --> 13:45.290
(rattles)

13:45.292 --> 13:46.991
...Under the
front wheel well.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.193
Wiped clean?

13:48.195 --> 13:51.196
Oh, yeah, including
the key inside.

13:51.198 --> 13:54.566
That is hardly something
that the owner would do.

13:54.568 --> 13:56.534
Someone else was driving
the truck.

13:56.536 --> 13:59.337
Yes, and they tried to make
it look like they weren't.

14:00.372 --> 14:01.539
Thanks, abbs.

14:06.245 --> 14:10.048
I don't understand
why people run.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.584
Oh, well, it's
therapeutic,

14:12.586 --> 14:14.219
It has great
cardiovascular benefits.

14:14.221 --> 14:16.554
What's more, it gets the
old endorphins pumping.

14:16.556 --> 14:19.424
I'll tell you, running
gives me a great high.

14:19.426 --> 14:22.060
I was referring
to the driver

14:22.062 --> 14:24.329
Running from the scene
of the accident, mr. Palmer.

14:24.331 --> 14:26.331
Oh, yes, yes.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.900
Did you know that
pedestrian hit-and-runs are

14:28.902 --> 14:31.069
At an epidemic rate
in this country?

14:31.071 --> 14:32.537
Nearly 11%

14:32.539 --> 14:35.139
Of all traffic accidents
in the United States are

14:35.141 --> 14:36.441
Hit-and-runs.

14:36.443 --> 14:37.508
That petty officer ray?

14:37.510 --> 14:40.278
Hold on to the body for
a little while longer,

14:40.280 --> 14:41.279
Will you, duck?

14:41.281 --> 14:42.280
You signed the release.

14:42.282 --> 14:43.448
Has something changed?

14:43.450 --> 14:45.650
Yeah.
(cell phone ringing)

14:47.486 --> 14:48.887
But I don't know what.

14:50.990 --> 14:51.990
Yeah, it's gibbs.

14:51.992 --> 14:52.991
Hi, it's carrie clark.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.192
Yeah, carrie, what do you got?

14:54.194 --> 14:55.460
Well, dunne's alibi

14:55.462 --> 14:57.328
Checks out, it's solid.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.030
Mm-hmm, tell me.
I can't.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.665
You're going to have
to start looking

15:00.667 --> 15:02.367
For the real hit-and-run driver
because it's not my client.

15:02.369 --> 15:05.470
Carrie, look, I can't just take
your word for it, okay?

15:05.472 --> 15:07.138
Give me
something here.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.073
You're gonna have to figure
this one out on your own, gibbs.

15:14.380 --> 15:17.181
Jethro, is something wrong?

15:24.957 --> 15:27.091
Looks like you
won't be leaving us

15:27.093 --> 15:29.160
Today after
all, my dear.

15:34.099 --> 15:35.533
Mcgee,

15:35.535 --> 15:37.402
Trace the last call,
will you?

15:37.404 --> 15:40.371
You want me to find out
who it was from?
It was from carrie clark.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.573
Usually her name comes up
on that little window there.

15:42.575 --> 15:45.209
This time it didn't;
it was just a number.
Hmm.

15:48.247 --> 15:49.314
What did she say?

15:49.316 --> 15:51.249
Said her client's alibi
checked out.

15:51.251 --> 15:52.951
I don't believe it.

15:52.953 --> 15:55.286
Well, the number belongs
to a pay phone.
Pay phone?

15:55.288 --> 15:56.587
I didn't think
there were any left.

15:56.589 --> 15:59.490
325 acacia avenue
in falls church.

15:59.492 --> 16:00.625
It's in front of the library.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.160
Carrie has a cell.

16:02.162 --> 16:03.528
Why would she use a pay phone?

16:03.530 --> 16:04.662
Not sure.

16:04.664 --> 16:07.598
She knows her client's alibi.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.335
She knows she can't tell us.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.337
What are you thinking, boss?

16:12.339 --> 16:14.339
Carrie knows we'll be intrigued,

16:14.341 --> 16:16.474
She knows
that we'll trace the call.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.343
Did she just drop a bread crumb?

16:18.345 --> 16:20.378
Yeah. Go. Go on.

16:32.024 --> 16:34.025
There's the pay phone.

16:34.027 --> 16:36.527
Why was carrie calling
from here?

16:38.063 --> 16:40.398
Mcgee:
Library, hardware store?

16:40.400 --> 16:43.668
Oh, there we go,
great sexpectations.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.004
I seriously
doubt it, tony.

16:47.706 --> 16:50.074
Hey, there's a squad car.

16:53.312 --> 16:55.313
Yeah, let's check it out.

16:56.715 --> 16:59.183
(horn honks)

16:59.185 --> 17:01.252
Did you ever find out
if carrie was divorced?

17:01.254 --> 17:03.087
Ah. Trial separation.

17:03.089 --> 17:04.322
She's not wearing
her ring.

17:04.324 --> 17:05.390
You know what
that means.

17:05.392 --> 17:07.025
It's over.

17:08.394 --> 17:10.395
Hey.

17:10.397 --> 17:12.363
Ncis.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.032
Special agents dinozzo
and mcgee.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.466
Dockry, homicide.

17:16.468 --> 17:17.468
Homicide?

17:17.470 --> 17:21.039
Oh, just pounding the
pavement, boring navy stuff.

17:21.041 --> 17:23.274
Yeah, nothing serious
like homicide.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.510
Who's dead?

17:25.512 --> 17:27.678
Store owner-- donny sullivan.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.313
Stabbed to death
night before last.

17:29.315 --> 17:30.581
Body was found
in the upstairs residence

17:30.583 --> 17:32.817
Yesterday morning
by an employee.

17:32.819 --> 17:35.219
Any leads?
Nothing concrete yet.

17:35.221 --> 17:36.454
Anything I can help
you guys with?

17:36.456 --> 17:37.522
Ah, no, we got to go.

17:37.524 --> 17:38.689
He gets hungry.

17:38.691 --> 17:40.658
It's true.
See you around.

17:40.660 --> 17:44.762
Hey, do you guys know
a special agent gibbs?

17:44.764 --> 17:48.599
Oh, yeah, we affectionately
refer to him as "boss."

17:48.601 --> 17:51.102
Tell him hickory's son said hi.

17:51.104 --> 17:52.203
Hickory?

17:52.205 --> 17:52.603
He'll know.

17:57.242 --> 17:58.476
The storekeeper's murder
happened

17:58.478 --> 18:00.278
About the same time
as the hit-and-run.

18:00.280 --> 18:03.081
Think this has something
to do with dunne's alibi?

18:03.083 --> 18:05.483
If dunne was involved,
then how'd he get

18:05.485 --> 18:06.751
From quantico to
here and back?

18:06.753 --> 18:08.553
His truck never
left the base.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.288
I think your amorous
little weekend in miami

18:10.290 --> 18:11.556
Just went bye-bye.

18:11.558 --> 18:12.790
(over phone):
Yeah. Gibbs.
Hey, boss.

18:12.792 --> 18:14.459
We might have a lead
on dunne's alibi.

18:14.461 --> 18:18.463
Find out what you can--
discreetly, dinozzo.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.531
Gibbs, gibbs, gibbs,
so I told you that I dusted

18:20.533 --> 18:22.767
The entire truck
for prints, but I didn't.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.136
I only dusted the places
that a person would touch,

18:25.138 --> 18:26.604
And then I realized
that if someone's going

18:26.606 --> 18:28.706
To adjust the seat lever,
which they did,

18:28.708 --> 18:31.542
They would probably also
adjust the rearview mirror.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.144
And guess what I found--

18:33.146 --> 18:35.446
A fresh right thumbprint
on its backside.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.547
Thumbprint have a name?

18:36.549 --> 18:38.616
Don't be silly, gibbs,

18:38.618 --> 18:40.885
Thumbprints don't have names.

18:42.454 --> 18:44.489
People do.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.157
My first pass
was to run it

18:46.159 --> 18:48.493
Against all the
personnel at quantico.

18:48.495 --> 18:49.560
(typing)

18:49.562 --> 18:51.529
And that's
all I had to do.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.331
Private daniel cliff.

18:58.871 --> 19:00.872
Gibbs will be in, in a minute.

19:00.874 --> 19:03.241
Thank you.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.243
You know why they brought me
over here?

19:05.245 --> 19:06.511
No.

19:06.513 --> 19:07.512
I told them I wouldn't say
anything else

19:07.514 --> 19:09.180
Until my lawyer
was present.

19:09.182 --> 19:11.215
Well, I checked your alibi.

19:11.217 --> 19:12.850
You weren't lying.

19:12.852 --> 19:15.553
Hey, you don't know who's on
the other side of that glass.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.221
Let's not discuss it
again.

19:17.223 --> 19:19.557
You know all you have to.

19:19.559 --> 19:20.625
I'm innocent.

19:23.428 --> 19:24.595
Couldn't this have waited
till the morning?

19:24.597 --> 19:26.464
Nope.

19:28.634 --> 19:29.767
You know him?
Yeah,

19:29.769 --> 19:31.602
Private cliff--
I see him around.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.204
You two close?

19:33.206 --> 19:34.772
No.

19:36.241 --> 19:38.276
We hung a couple of times
back when I was drinking.

19:38.278 --> 19:39.510
That was a long time ago.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.412
Have you seen each other lately?

19:41.414 --> 19:42.747
(sighs)

19:42.749 --> 19:45.950
Run into him in the laundry,
rec room, that's it.

19:45.952 --> 19:47.919
You give private
cliff permission

19:47.921 --> 19:49.453
To drive your pickup truck?

19:49.455 --> 19:52.623
Hell, no.

19:52.625 --> 19:53.791
What was that about?

19:57.796 --> 20:00.765
Gibbs? Sounds
like you have

20:00.767 --> 20:02.466
A suspect for your hit-and-run.

20:02.468 --> 20:04.802
You gonna let
my client go?
Not yet.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.337
Come on. He's due to deploy.

20:06.339 --> 20:07.705
Haven't brought private cliff in

20:07.707 --> 20:08.940
For questioning yet.

20:08.942 --> 20:10.575
Well, your 48-hour
clock is ticking.

20:10.577 --> 20:11.676
If you don't charge my client

20:11.678 --> 20:12.810
By tomorrow,
you have to let him go.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.679
You know,
a funny thing happened.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.247
We got a tip.

20:16.249 --> 20:18.683
Sent us to a cigar store
in falls church.

20:18.685 --> 20:22.720
Yeah, it was a crime scene,
a homicide.

20:24.456 --> 20:26.591
If your client
wasn't driving his truck

20:26.593 --> 20:28.459
On base the other night,

20:28.461 --> 20:31.629
Could he have been
in falls church?

20:33.599 --> 20:37.735
My only concern
is sergeant dunne's rights.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.971
He wasn't involved
in the hit-and-run.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.845
Hmm.

20:47.847 --> 20:50.815
A non-denial denial.

20:50.817 --> 20:53.884
Jason robards, as ben bradlee
in   <i>all the president's men.</i>

20:53.886 --> 20:56.420
She didn't say "no."

21:04.796 --> 21:07.398
(laughing)
oh, you're crazy.

21:07.400 --> 21:10.334
No, you must need glasses.

21:11.370 --> 21:13.738
Yeah, yeah.
All right, later.

21:14.840 --> 21:17.041
What's so funny?

21:17.043 --> 21:18.843
That was hollander in hr.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.645
She claims that she saw you
this morning

21:20.647 --> 21:23.014
At the front gate
getting off a city bus.

21:23.016 --> 21:24.649
Yeah, that was me.

21:24.651 --> 21:26.984
Listen, I know
I made fun of you

21:26.986 --> 21:30.021
In the past for riding the bus,
but I have to admit I was wrong.

21:30.023 --> 21:31.522
I've been using
public transportation,

21:31.524 --> 21:32.857
And I really like it.

21:32.859 --> 21:34.692
You're kidding.
No.

21:34.694 --> 21:35.993
I have time to read,

21:35.995 --> 21:38.029
Make some calls
and, best of all...

21:38.031 --> 21:39.597
I get to watch people.

21:39.599 --> 21:40.965
People are fascinating.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.334
Okay, tony, I'm...

21:43.336 --> 21:46.470
I don't even know
what I am right now.

21:46.472 --> 21:48.739
But I know you,
and this is not you.

21:48.741 --> 21:51.776
Boss, I went through
sergeant dunne's e-mails,

21:51.778 --> 21:53.344
Phone calls
and credit cards.

21:53.346 --> 21:54.945
I came up empty.

21:54.947 --> 21:57.648
There's no connecting him
to the dead cigar-store owner.

21:58.984 --> 22:00.851
What would his motive be
to kill the guy?

22:00.853 --> 22:02.753
Did find out dunne
exchanged a lot of calls

22:02.755 --> 22:04.855
With a maryland
cell phone number.

22:04.857 --> 22:06.490
Belongs to an olivia chandler.

22:06.492 --> 22:07.992
Yeah, well, find out who she is.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.494
Yup.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.396
Hmm. Do we dare run
sergeant dunne's name

22:12.398 --> 22:14.498
By falls church pd, see if
they can make a connection?

22:14.500 --> 22:15.766
Can't do that.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.568
Got to protect carrie clark.

22:17.570 --> 22:21.439
The homicide detective in charge
seemed to know you.

22:21.441 --> 22:24.775
Who?
Well, he said
to tell you,

22:24.777 --> 22:26.544
"hickory's son says hello."

22:26.546 --> 22:28.779
(laughs)
that's paul dockry.

22:28.781 --> 22:31.382
Hickory dickory dockry.

22:31.384 --> 22:33.517
His dad and I were in
the corps together.

22:33.519 --> 22:36.454
Come on, dinozzo.
You're with me.

22:36.456 --> 22:39.056
Huh. People are
fascinating.

22:51.436 --> 22:53.804
This boot print was found
at a crime scene

22:53.806 --> 22:55.873
That killed a petty officer.

22:55.875 --> 22:58.609
This is the same boot, the same
cutout at the right heel.

22:58.611 --> 23:00.111
And you know what else, cliff?

23:00.113 --> 23:02.046
We got your thumbprint
on the rearview mirror

23:02.048 --> 23:03.547
Of that vehicle.

23:03.549 --> 23:04.949
(panting)

23:04.951 --> 23:06.450
What happened?

23:06.452 --> 23:09.120
It was dark.

23:09.122 --> 23:10.988
I couldn't see her
until it was too late.

23:10.990 --> 23:12.890
What were you doing with
staff sergeant dunne's truck?

23:12.892 --> 23:14.625
I had a few drinks.

23:14.627 --> 23:15.893
I know this girl in stafford.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.728
I overheard dunne
in the rec room.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.663
Said he had a rough week and
was gonna hit the rack early.

23:19.665 --> 23:20.931
Figured I'd take his truck
and be back

23:20.933 --> 23:22.066
Before he even
missed it.
Bull!

23:22.068 --> 23:23.968
How'd you know
about the hidden key?

23:23.970 --> 23:25.770
About a year ago,
when he was still drinking,

23:25.772 --> 23:27.671
He got wasted, locked himself
out of his truck.

23:27.673 --> 23:29.740
Got the hidden key out,
had me drive him home.

23:29.742 --> 23:32.777
You left an injured woman to die
by the side of the road?
No!

23:32.779 --> 23:34.011
I stopped.

23:34.013 --> 23:35.513
I knew she was dead,

23:35.515 --> 23:37.114
And I realized
how bad it all looked.

23:37.116 --> 23:39.950
I was drinking,
I was driving a stolen vehicle.

23:39.952 --> 23:41.986
I just panicked and drove back
to the parking lot.

23:41.988 --> 23:44.021
You got to believe me.

23:44.023 --> 23:46.657
It was an accident.

23:53.165 --> 23:55.466
(door closes)

23:57.202 --> 23:58.569
I'll book him.
Uh-uh.

23:58.571 --> 24:00.004
If we charge private cliff

24:00.006 --> 24:01.539
With the hit-and-run,

24:01.541 --> 24:03.674
We got to let staff
sergeant dunne go.

24:03.676 --> 24:05.176
I'm not ready to do that.

24:05.178 --> 24:06.777
We only have a few more hours

24:06.779 --> 24:08.179
Until the clock
runs out on dunne.

24:08.181 --> 24:10.748
Put him in a holding cell.

24:19.090 --> 24:21.025
Hey, paul.
Hey, gibbs.

24:21.027 --> 24:22.626
Sorry. Just give me a sec.

24:22.628 --> 24:24.028
I got to finish this text
to my daughter.

24:24.030 --> 24:25.629
Only way she'll communicate me.

24:25.631 --> 24:28.632
The kid never answers her phone.

24:28.634 --> 24:30.634
Been a long time.

24:30.636 --> 24:32.236
How's your dad?

24:32.238 --> 24:34.638
Stubborn as always.

24:34.640 --> 24:37.241
Thought I might run into you
at my kid sister's wedding.

24:37.243 --> 24:40.244
Oh, no, no. I'm not...
I'm not big on weddings.

24:40.246 --> 24:41.946
I can understand that.

24:41.948 --> 24:45.483
Thanks for meeting me.

24:45.485 --> 24:48.719
Yeah. I ran into your agents
in falls church.

24:48.721 --> 24:50.788
Taking it, that wasn't
a coincidence.

24:50.790 --> 24:52.490
Uh, no.
So,

24:52.492 --> 24:54.124
What's your interest
in my homicide?

24:54.126 --> 24:56.727
Well, it's complicated, messy.

24:56.729 --> 24:58.529
Following a lead.

24:58.531 --> 24:59.797
Holding someone on
an unrelated charge.

24:59.799 --> 25:01.999
Seems to have an alibi,

25:02.001 --> 25:04.502
But he may have been involved
with your dead storekeeper.

25:04.504 --> 25:06.670
Like to talk to him.
Can't let you, not yet.

25:06.672 --> 25:08.539
Still trying
to protect a source.

25:08.541 --> 25:10.174
You have him in custody.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.142
Yeah, for the time being.

25:12.144 --> 25:14.879
What can you tell
me about your case?

25:14.881 --> 25:16.814
Discovered sullivan
was a bookie.

25:16.816 --> 25:18.816
Used the cigar store as a front.

25:18.818 --> 25:20.551
Guy you holding like to gamble?

25:20.553 --> 25:21.785
I'll find out.

25:21.787 --> 25:23.521
You got any suspects
for the murder?

25:23.523 --> 25:27.157
Yes... And no.

25:27.159 --> 25:30.528
Loser with a mile-long
rap sheet, wendell kaiser.

25:30.530 --> 25:32.096
Into sullivan big-time.

25:32.098 --> 25:33.597
Very public arguments.

25:33.599 --> 25:34.932
Kaiser even makes threats.

25:34.934 --> 25:36.200
However, airtight alibi.

25:36.202 --> 25:37.768
In new york
at the time of the murder.

25:37.770 --> 25:39.737
Just got back
this morning.
Hmm.

25:39.739 --> 25:41.772
Maybe alibis are in season, huh?

25:41.774 --> 25:43.107
Elaine:
Okay.

25:43.109 --> 25:44.241
Cheeseburger,

25:44.243 --> 25:46.610
No dressing, fries.

25:47.979 --> 25:50.781
Did I miss something?
You didn't even order.

25:50.783 --> 25:52.082
Well, he doesn't have to.

25:53.084 --> 25:54.184
Thanks, elaine.

25:54.186 --> 25:55.619
(laughs)

25:55.621 --> 25:58.789
Can you, uh, get
me kaiser's file?
Sure.

25:58.791 --> 26:00.958
I'll e-mail you the highlights.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.927
Your guy wouldn't happen to be
a hit man for hire, would he?

26:02.929 --> 26:04.728
No. I don't think so.

26:06.831 --> 26:08.666
What? Need something?

26:08.668 --> 26:11.735
Yeah, a knife to cut this beast.

26:17.676 --> 26:18.809
That'll work.

26:18.811 --> 26:21.278
Tony:
No, no, no.

26:21.280 --> 26:23.013
You're not serious.

26:23.015 --> 26:24.715
There's no way
she's married to him.

26:24.717 --> 26:26.684
Almost five years.
(sighs)

26:26.686 --> 26:28.719
The very definition
of a trophy wife.

26:28.721 --> 26:30.721
What you
looking at?
Olivia chandler.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.957
The woman who
sergeant dunne

26:32.959 --> 26:34.692
Has been exchanging
texts and calls with.

26:34.694 --> 26:36.226
That little man

26:36.228 --> 26:37.828
Must have a big,

26:37.830 --> 26:41.665
Big... Bank account.
She's married to him.

26:41.667 --> 26:43.367
They live together
in chevy chase village.

26:43.369 --> 26:44.868
Very la-dee-dah.

26:44.870 --> 26:47.671
Only thing on
her record is a dui.

26:47.673 --> 26:50.374
She was picked up for driving
erratically in her aston martin.

26:50.376 --> 26:51.675
So many jokes.

26:51.677 --> 26:53.043
Of course she drives
an aston martin.

26:53.045 --> 26:55.279
When I was searching
traffic cameras

26:55.281 --> 26:57.781
To see if I could place dunne
anywhere near the cigar store

26:57.783 --> 26:59.049
The night
of the murder,

26:59.051 --> 27:00.918
I found something interesting.

27:00.920 --> 27:05.155
Now, this was taken a block
from the cigar store.

27:05.157 --> 27:06.790
Because of the
tinted windows,

27:06.792 --> 27:08.158
You can't make out
who's inside.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.793
I sent it to abby.

27:09.795 --> 27:12.229
It's a long shot, but maybe
she can enhance the image.

27:12.231 --> 27:13.397
Sullivan was a bookie.

27:13.399 --> 27:15.866
Falls church police
had a suspect,

27:15.868 --> 27:17.267
But he has an alibi.

27:17.269 --> 27:19.803
Detective dockry said he was
going to e-mail the file.

27:19.805 --> 27:22.272
Mcgee:
He did.

27:22.274 --> 27:24.074
Wendell kaiser.
Mcgee--

27:24.076 --> 27:26.110
See if staff sergeant dunne
had a gambling problem

27:26.112 --> 27:27.411
Or any connection to this guy.

27:27.413 --> 27:29.980
Dinozzo...

27:29.982 --> 27:34.251
Check out
olivia chandler.

27:35.987 --> 27:37.821
With pleasure.

27:37.823 --> 27:39.256
Thank you, boss.

27:41.826 --> 27:43.894
(engine revving)

28:06.951 --> 28:08.185
(tony makes
an impressed whistle)

28:08.187 --> 28:09.953
May I help you?

28:09.955 --> 28:11.288
Oh, I hope so.

28:11.290 --> 28:14.091
Ncis special agent
anthony dinozzo.

28:14.093 --> 28:15.726
Ncis?

28:15.728 --> 28:17.928
I love this car.
It's smoking hot.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.363
I'm in
the market myself.

28:19.365 --> 28:23.367
Terrible gas mileage, but that's
what james bond drives.

28:23.369 --> 28:24.902
Did you know that?

28:24.904 --> 28:27.805
I have no idea.
What do you want?

28:27.807 --> 28:30.974
Oh, we're investigating
a marine.

28:30.976 --> 28:32.743
Staff sergeant justin dunne.

28:32.745 --> 28:33.844
How do you know him?

28:33.846 --> 28:35.045
I don't.
Really?

28:35.047 --> 28:36.880
'cause you exchanged
a lot of calls with him,

28:36.882 --> 28:38.148
And that would suggest
otherwise.

28:38.150 --> 28:40.484
We met at an a.A. Meeting.

28:40.486 --> 28:42.352
We talk to each other
for support.

28:42.354 --> 28:44.121
Sobriety is
an ongoing battle.

28:44.123 --> 28:45.823
So why'd you say
you didn't know him?

28:45.825 --> 28:48.492
The second "a" in a.A.
Is for "anonymous."

28:48.494 --> 28:50.894
I shouldn't be talking about him
or anyone else.

28:50.896 --> 28:52.196
Gotcha.

28:52.198 --> 28:53.897
So you're taking a little trip?

28:55.033 --> 28:57.234
I'm going to jamaica
with some girlfriends.

28:57.236 --> 28:59.236
(jamaican accent):
Yeah, mon. Jamaica.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.805
Well, have yourself a nice time.

29:06.010 --> 29:08.178
Gibbs:
Did you connect staff sergeant
dunne to the dead bookie

29:08.180 --> 29:09.947
Or the falls
church suspect?

29:09.949 --> 29:11.248
No, not yet.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.983
Based on the people
I've talked to,

29:12.985 --> 29:14.485
It appears that
dunne's not a gambler.

29:14.487 --> 29:15.986
I still have other
avenues to pursue,

29:15.988 --> 29:18.489
I just haven't had
the time to do it all.

29:18.491 --> 29:19.857
(chuckling)

29:19.859 --> 29:22.760
Tony, you got something?
Tony: Oh, yeah.

29:22.762 --> 29:24.862
You won't believe
how hot olivia chandler is.

29:24.864 --> 29:26.196
Photos don't
do her justice.

29:26.198 --> 29:27.965
What's with her
and staff sergeant dunne?

29:27.967 --> 29:29.166
Well, she claims
they're only acquaintances

29:29.168 --> 29:30.267
From a.A. Meetings.

29:30.269 --> 29:33.904
You said you had dunne's credit
card charges-- put them up.

29:33.906 --> 29:36.106
Why?
Trust me, put them up there.

29:39.077 --> 29:41.378
All right,
what are we looking for?

29:41.380 --> 29:42.913
Well, if they're doing
what I think they're doing,

29:42.915 --> 29:47.050
And I don't think a rich
housewife from chevy chase

29:47.052 --> 29:49.887
Is dragging those long legs
all the way down to quantico.

29:49.889 --> 29:50.988
Okay, wait. Hold on.

29:51.923 --> 29:53.891
Chevy chase lodge.

29:53.893 --> 29:55.359
There, there and there.

29:55.361 --> 29:57.427
Three nights, probably more.

29:59.998 --> 30:01.298
Take it down, mcgee.

30:04.903 --> 30:06.403
Our 48 hours are up.

30:06.405 --> 30:08.238
Yep.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.440
When do I get my truck back?

30:19.851 --> 30:21.218
I'm going to check out
the chevy chase lodge.

30:23.087 --> 30:24.988
Book private cliff
for the hit-and-run.

30:26.925 --> 30:30.394
That's one case closed,
another wide open.

30:39.137 --> 30:40.270
Man:
<i>Yes, dear, I understand.</i>

30:40.272 --> 30:41.471
Woman:
<i>Do you?</i>

30:41.473 --> 30:43.240
Do you even hear?
I hear you.

30:43.242 --> 30:45.475
No, no, no.
I-I would never...

30:45.477 --> 30:47.344
(woman continues shouting
indistinctly over phone)

30:47.346 --> 30:48.846
Well... Oh, it's
your mother's idea?

30:48.848 --> 30:50.247
Yes, it's my mother's idea!

30:50.249 --> 30:52.349
Why does that
not surprise me?

30:52.351 --> 30:53.483
(clears throat)

30:53.485 --> 30:55.485
I have to go.
I have a guest waiting.

30:55.487 --> 30:56.987
(woman yelling indistinctly
over phone)

30:56.989 --> 30:58.222
I do have a guest waiting.

30:58.224 --> 30:59.356
I'm not making that up.

30:59.358 --> 31:02.326
(woman talking angrily
over phone)

31:02.328 --> 31:05.429
Uh... Could you help me,
please, sir?

31:05.431 --> 31:06.897
Who is that? Hello?

31:06.899 --> 31:08.265
Okay. I'll call you later.

31:08.267 --> 31:09.867
Fine!
Like hell I will.

31:11.202 --> 31:13.036
(sighs)
you married?

31:13.038 --> 31:14.471
Oh. No. Uh...

31:14.473 --> 31:16.306
I'm a federal agent.

31:16.308 --> 31:17.407
Dinozzo.

31:17.409 --> 31:19.009
Like to ask a few questions.

31:19.011 --> 31:20.510
All right,
federal agent, ask away.

31:20.512 --> 31:22.145
Have you seen this man?

31:22.147 --> 31:23.146
Yeah.

31:23.148 --> 31:24.214
Yeah, sure.

31:25.350 --> 31:26.450
Sort of a regular.

31:26.452 --> 31:27.451
Mmm?

31:27.453 --> 31:28.986
So, does he come alone or...?

31:28.988 --> 31:31.321
Well, he'd like me
to think that.

31:31.323 --> 31:34.391
No, his friend never
comes to the lobby.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.493
He parks the car, and she goes
directly to the room.

31:36.495 --> 31:40.030
So you got to figure, you know,
one or both are married, right?

31:40.032 --> 31:42.266
Right.
Yeah. (chuckles)

31:42.268 --> 31:44.034
So you've never seen her?

31:44.036 --> 31:46.436
Well, actually, I did the old

31:46.438 --> 31:48.438
Knock-on-the-wrong-door
routine one time.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.107
She look like this?

31:50.109 --> 31:51.508
Yeah, that's her.

31:51.510 --> 31:53.577
Woman like that,
you do not forget.

31:53.579 --> 31:57.414
Right? I mean, can you imagine
what one night with...

31:57.416 --> 32:00.150
(phone ringing)

32:00.152 --> 32:01.952
I swear, the old witch
is psychic.

32:01.954 --> 32:04.521
If I have so much as a thought
of another woman...

32:04.523 --> 32:05.956
You don't have to answer that.

32:05.958 --> 32:07.057
I have to. What...?!

32:07.059 --> 32:08.458
...Do you want?

32:08.460 --> 32:09.559
I got it. Good luck.

32:09.561 --> 32:10.627
Just, do you
need... If...

32:10.629 --> 32:11.962
Take a card, sir.

32:11.964 --> 32:14.431
Thank you.

32:19.504 --> 32:20.504
Here.

32:22.440 --> 32:25.575
Ah, always enjoy having
a drink with you, duck,

32:25.577 --> 32:28.645
But this isn't exactly on your
way home from the symphony.

32:28.647 --> 32:30.247
What's on your mind?

32:30.249 --> 32:32.616
Well, curiously, I was
about to ask you that.

32:32.618 --> 32:34.985
You've seemed...
Troubled

32:34.987 --> 32:38.021
Since you took that call
in autopsy yesterday.

32:38.023 --> 32:42.492
Usually you're a master
at hiding your feelings.

32:42.494 --> 32:44.027
That your professional opinion?

32:44.029 --> 32:45.395
The occupational
hazard

32:45.397 --> 32:47.264
Of working with a profiler.

32:47.266 --> 32:48.498
Mmm.

32:48.500 --> 32:51.435
Yeah, I'm fine.

32:51.437 --> 32:55.238
A little concerned
about carrie clark.

32:55.240 --> 32:57.507
The lawyer?
Yeah, she's good.

32:57.509 --> 33:01.011
She got her client released
without being charged.

33:01.013 --> 33:03.747
I sense a "but."

33:03.749 --> 33:07.651
Well, she does have
a conscience.

33:07.653 --> 33:09.619
Well, that's a good thing,
isn't it?

33:11.589 --> 33:13.223
We learned some things
about her client

33:13.225 --> 33:17.194
That she may or may not
have led us to.

33:17.196 --> 33:19.062
Privileged information?

33:19.064 --> 33:22.132
Doc, I got to be careful
how I handle this.

33:22.134 --> 33:24.501
For carrie's sake.

33:24.503 --> 33:26.436
She could get disbarred.

33:26.438 --> 33:28.305
Well, I know
you, jethro.

33:28.307 --> 33:32.442
It sounds as if she's doing
the right thing, as you are.

33:32.444 --> 33:35.178
So how was the concert?

33:35.180 --> 33:38.448
Great.
Tchaikovsky's second.

33:38.450 --> 33:41.551
I never realized that he
wrote music for the movies.

33:50.461 --> 33:52.529
(tony makes
an impressed whistle)

33:52.531 --> 33:54.598
That's a car I've
always had the hots for.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.600
Maybe that's what
I should get.

33:56.602 --> 33:58.368
It's too old.

33:58.370 --> 33:59.636
You can't drive
a car like that.

33:59.638 --> 34:01.138
It's not practical.

34:01.140 --> 34:02.305
That's the problem
with you, mcgeezer.

34:02.307 --> 34:03.407
Everything has
to be practical.

34:03.409 --> 34:04.775
What...

34:04.777 --> 34:07.077
What I mean is, I've
never known you

34:07.079 --> 34:09.146
To do anything
even a little risqué.

34:09.148 --> 34:13.417
Tony, you have no idea
what I do on my time off.

34:13.419 --> 34:14.618
You know, that's
true, I don't.

34:14.620 --> 34:15.786
Why don't you tell me?

34:15.788 --> 34:20.090
Share. Rock me.
Sock me.

34:25.196 --> 34:26.663
Well, there's wendell kaiser.

34:26.665 --> 34:29.499
Wonder if falls church pd
is tailing him, too.

34:29.501 --> 34:31.368
Kaiser's their suspect.

34:31.370 --> 34:34.538
(engine starting)

34:48.419 --> 34:49.753
Is kaiser going
to church?

34:49.755 --> 34:51.521
No.
It's an a.A. Meeting.

34:51.523 --> 34:53.490
They meet here every
morning at this time.

34:53.492 --> 34:55.325
Wait, how do you
know that?

34:55.327 --> 34:56.693
Anthony!

34:56.695 --> 34:58.361
What are you
doing here?

34:58.363 --> 34:59.729
Your meeting's
not until tonight.

34:59.731 --> 35:02.299
Reverend miller,
I, uh...
Bringing a new member?

35:02.301 --> 35:03.600
Um...

35:03.602 --> 35:05.669
He's thinking about it.
A little gun-shy.

35:05.671 --> 35:07.838
Mcgee, the rev.

35:07.840 --> 35:09.606
Please join us.

35:09.608 --> 35:11.708
It's a very safe place.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.543
All are welcome.

35:18.149 --> 35:19.282
Tony, what's going on?

35:19.284 --> 35:20.383
Do you have
a drinking problem?

35:20.385 --> 35:22.786
No. No, I just...

35:22.788 --> 35:25.288
I joined this
men's support group.

35:25.290 --> 35:26.823
Meets in the church hall
two nights a week.

35:26.825 --> 35:28.658
You serious?

35:28.660 --> 35:30.460
Mm-hmm.

35:30.462 --> 35:32.629
I know, it...

35:32.631 --> 35:34.598
It doesn't sound like me,
but...

35:34.600 --> 35:37.667
With the past year,
I just...

35:37.669 --> 35:39.870
Wanted to shake things up
a little bit.

35:39.872 --> 35:41.738
Meet some new people.

35:41.740 --> 35:43.440
This guy at the gym
told me about the group,

35:43.442 --> 35:45.775
And I thought it sounded
like a good idea.

35:45.777 --> 35:47.811
And it... It is, it's fun.

35:49.614 --> 35:52.649
The rev drove me to quantico
the other morning.

35:52.651 --> 35:53.850
Interesting guy.

35:53.852 --> 35:55.752
He's helping me
be less judgmental.

35:58.456 --> 36:00.624
You know, kaiser's going
to be here for a while.

36:00.626 --> 36:02.292
We should get back.

36:11.602 --> 36:15.305
Tony:
Sergeant dunne, olivia chandler
and wendell kaiser

36:15.307 --> 36:17.307
All have one thing in common.

36:17.309 --> 36:18.875
They all go
to a.A. Meetings.

36:18.877 --> 36:20.510
That's probably
where they met.

36:20.512 --> 36:23.180
The sergeant and the trophy wife
are lovers.

36:23.182 --> 36:24.748
The desk clerk
at the chevy chase lodge

36:24.750 --> 36:26.750
Said that they were regulars.

36:26.752 --> 36:28.685
It's just like
that movie <i>body heat.</i>

36:28.687 --> 36:30.320
William hurt
and kathleen turner.

36:30.322 --> 36:31.922
God, she was really
something, boss.

36:31.924 --> 36:33.390
A head turner.

36:34.792 --> 36:36.826
But I digress.

36:36.828 --> 36:39.729
Anyway, they were young lovers,
just like these two,

36:39.731 --> 36:41.665
And they wanted
the rich husband's money

36:41.667 --> 36:42.966
And him out of the way.

36:42.968 --> 36:44.668
Mcgee:
On the other hand,
you've got

36:44.670 --> 36:46.236
Wendell kaiser, who's deep
in debt to his bookie

36:46.238 --> 36:49.639
Tony:
So they help each other out
and switch murders.

36:49.641 --> 36:51.274
Mcgee:
While kaiser
was in new york,

36:51.276 --> 36:53.710
Dunne killed the bookie
with olivia's help.

36:53.712 --> 36:55.879
She drove him.
Her car was in the vicinity.

36:55.881 --> 36:57.847
Who would ever
suspect them?

36:57.849 --> 36:59.716
I mean, there's no
connection, no motive.

36:59.718 --> 37:02.419
Tony:
Tomorrow sergeant dunne
is going to deploy

37:02.421 --> 37:04.454
And olivia chandler
is off to jamaica.

37:04.456 --> 37:06.690
And I'm betting that while
they're away,

37:06.692 --> 37:08.291
Her husband's going to have
a terrible accident

37:08.293 --> 37:09.826
At the hands of mr. Kaiser here,

37:09.828 --> 37:12.262
A man with whom
he has no connection.

37:12.264 --> 37:14.864
Two murders,
three solid alibis.

37:14.866 --> 37:16.600
Interesting theory.

37:16.602 --> 37:19.302
We know it's going to be a hard
conspiracy for us to prove.

37:19.304 --> 37:21.271
We got to be careful--
it's not our case.

37:25.843 --> 37:27.777
There's a way.

37:31.449 --> 37:32.916
Find the weak link.

37:40.024 --> 37:42.792
(indistinct conversation)

37:46.831 --> 37:47.998
Hey, kaiser.

37:49.934 --> 37:51.468
You got a minute?

37:51.470 --> 37:54.004
Detective dockry.

37:54.006 --> 37:56.706
I thought we were done.

37:56.708 --> 37:59.676
Look, I told you everything
I know about sullivan.

37:59.678 --> 38:01.311
Yeah, well, something's come up.

38:01.313 --> 38:03.513
Let's go to the station.
We can talk about it.

38:03.515 --> 38:05.815
Nah, I'm not
going anywhere.

38:05.817 --> 38:07.851
Look, I had nothing to do
with sullivan's murder.

38:07.853 --> 38:09.886
I was in new york, man.
You checked it out.

38:09.888 --> 38:13.757
You really want to do this
in front of your friends?

38:15.726 --> 38:17.594
I'm not going anywhere with you.

38:19.830 --> 38:22.799
We know about your buddy,
sergeant dunne,

38:22.801 --> 38:25.769
And his girlfriend.

38:29.807 --> 38:31.841
So let me explain
how this works.

38:31.843 --> 38:36.579
First suspect to flip
on the others gets the deal.

39:05.976 --> 39:08.511
♪

39:16.854 --> 39:19.389
Olivia chandler?

39:37.641 --> 39:39.709
♪

39:52.757 --> 39:55.091
Hey, gibbs.

39:55.093 --> 39:56.893
Dinozzo told me that
if you weren't at home

39:56.895 --> 39:59.028
I would probably find you here.

39:59.030 --> 40:00.430
(chuckles)

40:00.432 --> 40:01.965
Have a seat.

40:06.604 --> 40:08.138
There a problem?

40:08.140 --> 40:09.873
No, I...

40:09.875 --> 40:11.574
Just heard
that falls church pd

40:11.576 --> 40:14.110
Arrested my former client,
sergeant dunne.

40:14.112 --> 40:15.645
Really?

40:15.647 --> 40:17.414
Yeah, they booked him
on multiple charges,

40:17.416 --> 40:21.084
Including conspiracy to commit
murder and murder one.

40:21.086 --> 40:22.452
How'd they get him?

40:22.454 --> 40:24.921
Apparently one of
his coconspirators

40:24.923 --> 40:26.790
Turned state's evidence.

40:26.792 --> 40:30.960
Sometimes...
You get lucky.

40:30.962 --> 40:33.463
Mmm, is that what it was?

40:35.199 --> 40:38.802
They got a warrant and cinched
the case against dunne

40:38.804 --> 40:40.670
When they found
the murder weapon, a knife,

40:40.672 --> 40:43.706
In his bathroom toilet tank.

40:43.708 --> 40:45.875
(both laughing)
that's great.

40:48.712 --> 40:51.114
You okay?

40:51.116 --> 40:54.150
Yeah.

40:54.152 --> 40:55.885
Why wouldn't I be?
I did my job.

40:55.887 --> 40:57.520
I got dunne off
on the hit-and-run.

40:57.522 --> 40:59.022
Yeah, you did it well.

40:59.024 --> 41:01.224
Yes, and whatever
happened to him after that,

41:01.226 --> 41:05.061
Justice was served,
all around.

41:08.032 --> 41:10.600
Okay. Here you go.

41:10.602 --> 41:12.702
Care to join me for dinner?

41:12.704 --> 41:17.173
Hmm, meat loaf
and mashed potatoes?

41:19.176 --> 41:21.811
My favorite.
I would be happy to.

41:23.047 --> 41:24.247
Coming right up.

41:24.249 --> 41:26.115
Thanks, elaine.

41:29.687 --> 41:33.690
I think that you and me have
a few things in common.
