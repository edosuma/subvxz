WEBVTT

00:09.999 --> 00:11.999
Keeping Up
with the Kardashians...

00:11.999 --> 00:13.999
Lamar Odom in
critical condition.

00:13.999 --> 00:16.999
I'm gonna go back this
afternoon, see what Khloe needs.

00:16.999 --> 00:19.999
I don't think she
was leaving his side.

00:19.999 --> 00:21.999
I heard that Scott has
gone to rehab.

00:21.999 --> 00:24.999
I hope that he'll
want to stay.

00:24.999 --> 00:28.999
- So we're throwing Mom a party.
- An epic party.

00:28.999 --> 00:30.999
We're doing this video for her
60th birthday.

00:30.999 --> 00:32.999
We have to record
it in a studio.

00:32.999 --> 00:34.999
- Oh, my God.
- Who's the Beyoncé,

00:34.999 --> 00:37.999
guys?
We all know it's me.

00:46.999 --> 00:48.999
There's some pics
you cannot tell you're pregnant.

00:48.999 --> 00:50.999
- It's the weirdest  thing.
- I know, it's so...

00:50.999 --> 00:52.999
Stephanie said that.
From the side, you can see it

00:52.999 --> 00:54.999
- more, but...
- I know, but, like,

00:54.999 --> 00:56.999
right now, uh, you don't look
pregnant at all.

00:56.999 --> 00:59.999
Yeah. Yeah.
I went to this Ellen DeGeneres

00:59.999 --> 01:03.999
event, and I said, "What did
show?"

01:03.999 --> 01:07.999
And she said something how she
didn't approve of gay marriage.

01:07.999 --> 01:10.999
- What?
- And so I was like, "Oh,

01:10.999 --> 01:13.999
my gosh," like, 'cause then I
guess Ellen was talking about

01:13.999 --> 01:16.999
how she just doesn't understand
how Caitlyn wants to be

01:16.999 --> 01:19.999
accepted, but she's still
Republican, so she doesn't

01:19.999 --> 01:22.999
believe in gay marriage.
So Caitlyn called me yesterday,

01:22.999 --> 01:25.999
and she was like, "You know, I
I used to think

01:25.999 --> 01:28.999
that, and now I've opened my
mind, and that didn't really

01:28.999 --> 01:31.999
come across."
And you know the headlines are

01:31.999 --> 01:34.999
gonna be, "Bruce Jenner says..."
Yeah, so she kept on referring

01:34.999 --> 01:37.999
to herself, like, twice in the
conversation, as "Bruce."

01:37.999 --> 01:39.999
And I was like, "Uh, you mean
Caitlyn."

01:39.999 --> 01:41.999
He's like, "Uh, you know
what I mean."

01:41.999 --> 01:43.999
Sh... He did think at
the time, and now she doesn't

01:43.999 --> 01:46.999
- think.
- Yeah.

02:04.999 --> 02:06.999
Would you guys judge me
if I had one more Fruit Roll-Up?

02:06.999 --> 02:08.999
I won't judge you
ever, because you're living my

02:08.999 --> 02:11.999
dream, like, you're-you're
eating everything I wish I could

02:11.999 --> 02:15.999
do.
We have so much going on in our

02:15.999 --> 02:17.999
lives.
This week, it's birthday week of

02:17.999 --> 02:20.999
hell, 'cause it's every day is a
different birthday.

02:20.999 --> 02:24.999
Caitlyn, Kendall, Mom.
So tired just thinking about it.

02:24.999 --> 02:26.999
It's, uh, just a
crazy week for everybody.

02:26.999 --> 02:28.999
We're all trying to be there to
support Khloe.

02:28.999 --> 02:32.999
Because of everything going on
with Lamar, she hasn't even been

02:32.999 --> 02:35.999
able to, like, take a breath.
Kim and I kind of took over with

02:35.999 --> 02:38.999
the party.
We're excited, but it's, like,

02:38.999 --> 02:40.999
- bittersweet at the same time.
- Okay, so Mom knows

02:40.999 --> 02:42.999
- about the party.
Mm-hmm.

02:42.999 --> 02:43.999
She just doesn't know
everything.

02:43.999 --> 02:45.999
Wait, is James
coming?

02:45.999 --> 02:48.999
He has a game
Saturday, so it depends.

02:48.999 --> 02:50.999
How do we feel that I'm going to
the game on Saturday?

02:50.999 --> 02:52.999
Yeah, you can go to
a basketball game of your

02:52.999 --> 02:55.999
- boyfriend's.
- Yeah.

02:55.999 --> 02:59.999
I mean, Khloe finally moved on.
She is dating someone new that

02:59.999 --> 03:02.999
she adores.
And then, you know, this

03:02.999 --> 03:04.999
happened, so I can't even
imagine the internal struggle

03:04.999 --> 03:06.999
that Khloe must be going
through.

03:06.999 --> 03:09.999
It must be hard for Khloe.
There's a lot of decisions that

03:09.999 --> 03:11.999
she has to make.
But we'll all be there to

03:11.999 --> 03:13.999
- support her.
- Kobe did physical

03:13.999 --> 03:15.999
therapy with him yesterday.
It was really cute.

03:15.999 --> 03:17.999
- They were saying...
- Does he remember Kobe?

03:17.999 --> 03:19.999
- Like, does he know?
- I said, I go, "Did you

03:19.999 --> 03:23.999
have a nice morning with Kobe?"
He said, "Intense."

03:23.999 --> 03:26.999
The situation right now is
incredibly fragile.

03:26.999 --> 03:30.999
Hospital life is not fun, and
it's depressing and sad, and I

03:30.999 --> 03:32.999
am very protective of Lamar
right now.

03:32.999 --> 03:35.999
I feel so guilty being away from
him.

03:35.999 --> 03:40.999
Even though I have technically
left the hospital, my brain is

03:40.999 --> 03:43.999
still at the hospital.
I get super-anxious.

03:43.999 --> 03:47.999
I was talking to the nurse, and
I said an employee at the Vegas

03:47.999 --> 03:50.999
hospital asked Lamar the day he
woke up out of a coma, can he

03:50.999 --> 03:52.999
take a picture with him?
I'm like, "If I'm not here,

03:52.999 --> 03:54.999
Lamar's never allowed to be
alone with a nurse or anyone.

03:54.999 --> 03:57.999
I don't want anyone asking him
for photos."

03:57.999 --> 03:59.999
Yeah.

03:59.999 --> 04:01.999
I have to go back to
the hospital.

04:09.999 --> 04:11.999
Do eyebrow pencils
smell?

04:11.999 --> 04:13.999
What?
What?

04:13.999 --> 04:15.999
Just kidding, it
doesn't smell like anything.

04:15.999 --> 04:17.999
Oh, my God, I was so
confused.

04:17.999 --> 04:19.999
- Do you want to know something?
- What?

04:19.999 --> 04:21.999
You have to promise
you won't tell anyone.

04:21.999 --> 04:23.999
Prom-prom.
Victoria's

04:23.999 --> 04:25.999
- Secret Fashion Show.
- Oh, my God.

04:25.999 --> 04:28.999
You're gonna be an Angel.
Or, technically, would you be an

04:28.999 --> 04:30.999
- Angel?
- N... I mean, not

04:30.999 --> 04:33.999
technically, but, I mean, I'll
be, like, a walking-on-the-

04:33.999 --> 04:36.999
runway Angel.
I cannot believe that this

04:36.999 --> 04:39.999
Victoria's Secret show's
actually happening, 'cause it's

04:39.999 --> 04:40.999
something that I've always
wanted to do.

04:40.999 --> 04:42.999
What do you want to
do, Kendall?

04:42.999 --> 04:44.999
- Model.
- You know, Kendall's

04:44.999 --> 04:46.999
dream is to be a Victoria's
Secret model.

04:46.999 --> 04:48.999
And I'm really
excited.

04:48.999 --> 04:50.999
- That is so amazing.
- I, like, cried when

04:50.999 --> 04:52.999
Mom told me.
But, yeah, I mean, you know how

04:52.999 --> 04:55.999
- long I've wanted to do this.
- Mmm, I bet.

04:55.999 --> 04:57.999
- When is it?
- The 10th.

04:57.999 --> 05:01.999
Okay, dope.
I think I'm going to, um, Dad's

05:01.999 --> 05:03.999
thing on the 9th or
something.

05:03.999 --> 05:05.999
- Oh, sick.
- So maybe we should

05:05.999 --> 05:08.999
- come and support.
- Um...

05:08.999 --> 05:11.999
I mean, yeah.
I... I'm still, like, figuring

05:11.999 --> 05:16.999
all of that out and, like,
figuring out what I want to do.

05:16.999 --> 05:19.999
You know, I already feel like
sometimes I have to, like, prove

05:19.999 --> 05:21.999
myself in the industry that I'm
in.

05:21.999 --> 05:23.999
I'm just trying to be
professional.

05:23.999 --> 05:26.999
So to have my whole family
sitting there, it's a media

05:26.999 --> 05:28.999
frenzy.
I just want to, like, do the

05:28.999 --> 05:31.999
show and not have to worry about
anything else.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.999
I mean, obviously, I want you
guys there, but I'm just

05:33.999 --> 05:37.999
- thinking about it.
- Okay.

05:51.999 --> 05:55.999
I want to get one of
those, um, some cool jackets.

05:55.999 --> 06:01.999
So let me go to my app.
How do you feel today?

06:01.999 --> 06:04.999
Good.
So I want to tell you about your

06:04.999 --> 06:06.999
birthday party.
We want you to be as surprised

06:06.999 --> 06:09.999
as possible and just, like, not
really be a part of it, but I

06:09.999 --> 06:12.999
think you need to know the dress
code because it is

06:12.999 --> 06:15.999
- theme.
- Stop. Oh, my God.

06:15.999 --> 06:17.999
- Yeah. Swear.
- So much fun.

06:17.999 --> 06:21.999
'20s, glam, black tie.
Like, so major.

06:21.999 --> 06:23.999
- You're gonna die.
- Oh, my God.

06:23.999 --> 06:25.999
I think you should
either do, like, a long gown,

06:25.999 --> 06:28.999
uh, or, like, really, really
short, you know?

06:28.999 --> 06:30.999
- With, like, fringe?
- That's gonna be fun.

06:30.999 --> 06:32.999
I like a theme.
that theme.

06:32.999 --> 06:35.999
I'm just, you know, we
were, like, debating, do we

06:35.999 --> 06:37.999
change the date, do we keep the
date? 'Cause it's the day after

06:37.999 --> 06:40.999
your birthday, which is
Lamar's real birthday.

06:40.999 --> 06:43.999
- But we can celebrate him too.
- Yeah.

06:43.999 --> 06:47.999
It's a celebration.
I'm so overwhelmed with what's

06:47.999 --> 06:50.999
going on with Lamar, but at the
same time, my kids have been

06:50.999 --> 06:54.999
putting a lot into my birthday
party, and it makes me feel

06:54.999 --> 06:57.999
really, really good that they
would even want to do something

06:57.999 --> 07:00.999
like this for me.
All right.

07:00.999 --> 07:02.999
Well, I'm excited.
And really old.

07:16.999 --> 07:19.999
Uh... so, for Mom's

07:19.999 --> 07:21.999
video, did we ask Cici to send a
clip?

07:21.999 --> 07:23.999
I'm calling her right
now-- this is absolutely

07:23.999 --> 07:27.999
disgusting.

07:27.999 --> 07:29.999
Donna, two seconds.
I'm with Kourtney.

07:29.999 --> 07:33.999
Did we ask you to give us a
video that says she loves you.

07:33.999 --> 07:35.999
- No!
- What the?

07:35.999 --> 07:38.999
- Oh, my God!
- Chaunch!

07:38.999 --> 07:41.999
We asked my mom's old friends
and family members to record

07:41.999 --> 07:44.999
their own part to include in
the video, and now we're just

07:44.999 --> 07:47.999
trying to get everyone to send
them.

07:47.999 --> 07:50.999
Listen, Kourtney's
baby daddy's in rehab, my

07:50.999 --> 07:53.999
something's in the hospital,
our brains are crazy.

07:53.999 --> 07:56.999
Come on, you "shabba shauncy
shoon," let's do this.

07:56.999 --> 07:59.999
- I just washed my hair.
- Put your hair up

07:59.999 --> 08:01.999
in a towel and just say she
loves you.

08:01.999 --> 08:04.999
- Oh, you're gonna die!
- Okay, bye.

08:04.999 --> 08:07.999
I'm going to
therapy today with Scott at the

08:07.999 --> 08:10.999
- rehab place.
- How do you feel?

08:10.999 --> 08:13.000
Uh, I'm fine.
Just anxious. I hate doing that

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
- kind of stuff.
- Why?

08:15.000 --> 08:17.999
I don't know.
Just, like, annoying that, you

08:17.999 --> 08:19.999
know, you have to go, like, talk
about...

08:19.999 --> 08:20.999
The same thing over
and over again?

08:20.999 --> 08:23.000
- Yeah.
- It's so draining.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.999
- Your second time seeing him?
Mm-hmm.

08:26.999 --> 08:31.999
Even though mine and
Kourtney's situations are very

08:31.999 --> 08:34.999
different, we're going
through... so many of the same

08:34.999 --> 08:39.999
things, and it's so hard.
Like, it's like playing a

08:39.999 --> 08:43.000
tug-of-war with your heart.
We're stuck to them, somehow,

08:43.000 --> 08:46.999
but we still want to, like,
proceed with our lives.

08:46.999 --> 08:48.999
We don't know what's right or
wrong.

08:48.999 --> 08:50.999
It's... I don't... it's just
crazy.

08:50.999 --> 08:55.999
The amount of pressure that's on
me... they all say, "You know

08:55.999 --> 08:58.000
Lamar wouldn't be surviving if
it wasn't for you.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.999
You know Lamar.
Well, don't leave here without

09:00.999 --> 09:03.999
Lamar."
I'm not, you guys, okay?

09:03.999 --> 09:05.999
I'm trying.
But I had a life before this

09:05.999 --> 09:07.999
- happened.
Mm-hmm.

09:07.999 --> 09:09.999
So, why does everyone
forget this whole situation and

09:09.999 --> 09:11.999
- want me to ruin my life?
- Well, who cares

09:11.999 --> 09:13.999
about what everyone else thinks?
It's about what you know.

09:13.999 --> 09:15.999
You just need to be confident in
your decision.

09:15.999 --> 09:18.999
And I want to live the
life that I was already living

09:18.999 --> 09:22.999
before this whole thing
happened!

09:22.999 --> 09:24.999
Kylie, why aren't you taking
this seriously?

09:24.999 --> 09:25.999
Yeah, you're
so annoying.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.999
Because I'm having
issues...

09:27.999 --> 09:29.999
But it doesn't matter.
This is about somebody else!

09:29.999 --> 09:33.000
- I'm going to cry!
- Tonight is the big

09:33.000 --> 09:37.999
night and I'm really, really
excited.

09:43.999 --> 09:45.999
I had a life before
this happened.

09:45.999 --> 09:47.999
Mm-hmm.
- So, why does everyone

09:47.999 --> 09:49.999
forget this whole situation and
want me to ruin my life?

09:49.999 --> 09:51.999
Well, who cares
what everyone else thinks?

09:51.999 --> 09:53.999
It's about what you know.
You just need to be confident in

09:53.999 --> 09:55.999
- your decision.
- And I want to live the

09:55.999 --> 09:58.999
life that I was already living
before this whole thing

09:58.999 --> 10:00.999
- happened.
- I mean, you

10:00.999 --> 10:03.999
- shouldn't feel guilty.
- Yeah.

10:03.999 --> 10:06.999
You have to take
care of yourself, too.

10:06.999 --> 10:11.999
I mean, I know I have
to start my daily routines again

10:11.999 --> 10:15.999
and I have to get back to my
normal life, but it's hard to

10:15.999 --> 10:20.999
not feel guilty.
Going to work or, you know,

10:20.999 --> 10:24.999
promoting my book or things like
that, that I was so excited

10:24.999 --> 10:29.999
- about, I feel, like, selfish.
- But just when you

10:29.999 --> 10:32.999
- make plans, God laughs.
- Oh, don't steal my

10:32.999 --> 10:34.999
quotes.

10:34.999 --> 10:37.999
Oh, my God!
What?!

10:37.999 --> 10:40.999
- Cici, yes!
- Wait, Donna...

10:40.999 --> 10:43.999
Just look at the
visual, just look.

10:43.999 --> 10:47.999
She loves you.

10:47.999 --> 10:49.999
Don't put my bra in there.

10:49.999 --> 10:52.999

20:38.999 --> 20:40.999
- over well.
Mm-hmm. Right, right.

20:40.999 --> 20:42.999
And 'cause I invited
him personally, so it's not like

20:42.999 --> 20:43.999
- you invited him.
- Who?

20:43.999 --> 20:45.999
- Tyga.
- You guys are fighting?

20:45.999 --> 20:47.999
- No, I'm just...
- Kendall, could you

20:47.999 --> 20:49.999
- step to your left, please.
- Over Tyga?

20:49.999 --> 20:52.999
Tonight, I am
celebrating my 20th birthday and

20:52.999 --> 20:56.999
I invited Tyga before Kylie and
Tyga had their issue.

20:56.999 --> 20:58.999
Kylie's always extremely vague
when there's stuff going on with

20:58.999 --> 21:00.999
Tyga.
She doesn't really open up, to

21:00.999 --> 21:02.999
me at least.
So I don't know.

21:02.999 --> 21:04.999
I guess we'll just see what
happens.

21:04.999 --> 21:06.999
I think you should experience
it.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.999
You always say, "I want to
experience things," but I don't

21:08.999 --> 21:10.999
think you actually want to
experience things, because you

21:10.999 --> 21:12.999
would experience it if you
wanted to experience things.

21:12.999 --> 21:14.999
I don't know what
you're talking about.

21:14.999 --> 21:16.999
Meaning you should
experience being single.

21:16.999 --> 21:18.999
Kylie, you're wearing
a different jacket.

21:18.999 --> 21:20.999
Kylie's wearing a different
jacket.

21:20.999 --> 21:23.999
Is it the black
one?

21:23.999 --> 21:24.999
Why aren't you taking
this seriously?

21:24.999 --> 21:26.999
Yeah, you're so
annoying.

21:26.999 --> 21:27.999
Because I'm having
issues.

21:27.999 --> 21:29.999
But it doesn't matter.
This is about somebody else.

21:29.999 --> 21:31.999
I'm gonna cry if we
don't...

21:31.999 --> 21:34.999
- What's wrong?
- Why are you crying?

21:34.999 --> 21:36.999
What are you crying about?

21:36.999 --> 21:38.999
I don't want to do
this.

21:38.999 --> 21:40.999
I thought she was
kidding, too.

21:40.999 --> 21:45.999
- Why is she crying?
- Kyles...

21:45.999 --> 21:46.999
- Did you get in a fight?
- I just, like, don't

21:46.999 --> 21:49.999
know what to do about T.

21:49.999 --> 21:52.999
Why were you mad that
Caitlyn wants to go to the show?

21:52.999 --> 21:54.999
- 'Cause Caitlyn's going.
- Because you opened your

21:54.999 --> 21:56.999
big mouth.

22:00.999 --> 22:02.999
Why aren't you taking
this seriously?

22:02.999 --> 22:04.999
I'll cry if we
don't...

22:04.999 --> 22:08.999
- What's wrong?
- Why are you crying?

22:08.999 --> 22:10.999
I don't want to do
this.

22:10.999 --> 22:12.999
I thought she was
kidding, too.

22:12.999 --> 22:16.999
Why is she crying?
Like, you think I want to be

22:16.999 --> 22:18.999
here?
It's your birthday tonight, your

22:18.999 --> 22:22.999
25 months pregnant...
I'd rather be in the hospital.

22:22.999 --> 22:24.999
I know, but
whatever she's going through...

22:24.999 --> 22:26.999
I understand that, but
I... we're all going through

22:26.999 --> 22:28.999
things, but let's tough it out
for the one hour to make Mom

22:28.999 --> 22:30.999
happy.
Or is that fine?

22:30.999 --> 22:32.999
Yeah, I'll go talk
to her.

22:32.999 --> 22:33.999
But, like, hur...
Mom's gonna be here any second.

22:33.999 --> 22:35.999
- Maybe we got it.
- I think we have to

22:35.999 --> 22:36.999
- be done.
- Do you know how many

22:36.999 --> 22:38.999
times I've been going through
something that I had to pull

22:38.999 --> 22:41.999
myself together for?
Like, that's just life.

22:41.999 --> 22:44.999
- Get your  together.
- Kyles?

22:44.999 --> 22:46.999
What happened?
Did you get in a fight?

22:46.999 --> 22:48.999
I just, like, don't
know what to do about T.

22:48.999 --> 22:50.999
It's just, like, he just called
me, and I'm just having issues

22:50.999 --> 22:51.999
- with him.
- Today?

22:51.999 --> 22:53.999
Like, just now.
But it's just weird and I don't

22:53.999 --> 22:56.999
know what to do, so...
Whatever, I'll figure it out.

22:56.999 --> 22:58.999
Well, so what do
you want to do?

22:58.999 --> 23:00.999
- I'm just gonna go.
- Why don't you...

23:00.999 --> 23:02.999
My makeup's ugly
anyway, I don't even want to be

23:02.999 --> 23:05.000
on camera.
I feel really, really bad that

23:05.000 --> 23:08.999
this is, like, the only day that
all of us can get together, but

23:08.999 --> 23:11.999
I'm just upset right now and I
don't know if I could finish it.

23:11.999 --> 23:14.999
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

23:14.999 --> 23:16.999
Okay, we're coming
over at 5:00.

23:16.999 --> 23:19.999
- Love you.
- What'd she say?

23:19.999 --> 23:21.999
She just said stuff
with T.

23:21.999 --> 23:23.999
We're just gonna
have to work with what we have.

23:23.999 --> 23:26.999
Um, all right, so
I'll see you at the party

23:26.999 --> 23:28.999
- tonight.
- Yeah.

23:28.999 --> 23:38.999
Okay.♪ ♪

23:38.999 --> 23:41.999
- There you guys are.
- Oh, hi.

23:41.999 --> 23:43.999
- Hi.
- Clear your

23:43.999 --> 23:45.999
schedule.
We're gonna be eating a lot.

23:45.999 --> 23:46.999
- But I'm getting better.
- I'm tempted to not eat

23:46.999 --> 23:48.999
that much.
I'm, like, roly-poly status at

23:48.999 --> 23:50.999
- this point.
- You're not roly-poly.

23:50.999 --> 23:52.999
- I am.
- She's much less

23:52.999 --> 23:54.999
roly-poly than last time.
- You're pregnant.

23:54.999 --> 23:55.999
- If you weren't roly-poly...
- No, my stomach is

23:55.999 --> 23:57.999
sticking out more and that just
freaks me out, like, more.

23:57.999 --> 23:59.999
Right, but last
time, you were like...

23:59.999 --> 24:01.999
Like, the whole thing...

24:01.999 --> 24:03.999
...was literally Jabba the
Hutted out.

24:03.999 --> 24:05.000
No, look at how big my
thighs are.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.999
Right, so, now,
double that and that was last

24:06.999 --> 24:08.999
time.
So, in case you forgot...

24:08.999 --> 24:10.999
- No.
- Yeah.

24:10.999 --> 24:12.999
Wait, tell me about The
Edition.

24:12.999 --> 24:13.999
- In New York?
Mm-hmm.

24:13.999 --> 24:14.999
- A hotel?
- Yeah, it's

24:14.999 --> 24:16.999
- beautiful, it's a clock tower.
- It's where...

24:16.999 --> 24:17.999
It's right on
Madison Square Park.

24:17.999 --> 24:18.999
I need to go there on
the ninth.

24:18.999 --> 24:20.999
- For the big show?
Mm-hmm.

24:20.999 --> 24:24.999
Why were you mad that
Caitlyn wants to go to the show?

24:24.999 --> 24:26.999
Because it's something
that...

24:26.999 --> 24:28.999
It's her dad and she
should go to something like

24:28.999 --> 24:30.999
- that.
- She doesn't want one

24:30.999 --> 24:32.999
- person there.
- But you can go.

24:32.999 --> 24:34.999
No, I'm gonna be
backstage with Kendall.

24:34.999 --> 24:36.999
It's something that we've worked
on from day one.

24:36.999 --> 24:37.999
So you're not gonna go
sit in the front?

24:37.999 --> 24:39.999
No.
She doesn't want anybody to sit

24:39.999 --> 24:41.999
- out in the front row.
- So tell her to tell

24:41.999 --> 24:43.999
- Caitlyn. 'Cause Caitlyn's going.
- Because you opened your

24:43.999 --> 24:46.999
big mouth when I said, "Please
don't say a word to anyone."

24:46.999 --> 24:48.999
I thought her dad should
know that she is fulfilling one

24:48.999 --> 24:50.999
- of her lifelong dreams.
- No, not until she's

24:50.999 --> 24:52.999
ready, that's why I'll never
tell you anything again like

24:52.999 --> 24:55.999
that.
She wants this to be about her.

24:55.999 --> 24:59.999
She doesn't want one of us to
take attention away.

24:59.999 --> 25:03.999
If Caitlyn goes and sits in the
audience of a televised

25:03.999 --> 25:09.999
show-- like, Oh, my God, Kendall
will kill herself.

25:09.999 --> 25:12.999
Look at this car!
Cheers, baby.

25:12.999 --> 25:16.999
Cheers and a beautiful
happy birthday.

25:16.999 --> 25:19.999
I know Kendall already
invited T.

25:19.999 --> 25:27.999
I just hope that we can make it
through the night without drama.

25:27.999 --> 25:29.999
If Caitlyn goes and
sits in the  audience of

25:29.999 --> 25:34.999
a televised show, like, oh, my
God, Kendall will kill herself.

25:34.999 --> 25:36.999
I knew that Kendall
walking in the Victoria's Secret

25:36.999 --> 25:40.999
show was a secret, but I didn't
think that meant I couldn't tell

25:40.999 --> 25:43.000
her own dad.
You know, I said something.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.999
Like, she just needs to slow
down.

25:45.999 --> 25:48.999
I feel like sometimes we hide
behind my mom and think, because

25:48.999 --> 25:52.999
she's our manager, she can just,
like, fix everything.

25:52.999 --> 25:57.999
Kendall needs to, like, man up
and tell her dad what she wants.

25:57.999 --> 25:59.999
So call Kendall.
Let's call Kendall.

25:59.999 --> 26:01.999
Okay.

26:01.999 --> 26:04.999
- Hi.
- Do you really not want

26:04.999 --> 26:06.999
Caitlyn to come to the
Victoria's Secret show?

26:06.999 --> 26:09.999
You guys, I want
everyone there, but I think it's

26:09.999 --> 26:12.999
- better that no one's there.
- Okay, so I think that

26:12.999 --> 26:15.999
your dad is so excited, 'cause
she just happens to be in New

26:15.999 --> 26:17.999
York, just call her and just
say...

26:17.999 --> 26:20.999
"I don't want you
there, please come to the after

26:20.999 --> 26:21.999
party and we'll all meet at the
after party."

26:21.999 --> 26:23.999
And just say, "I don't
want one family member there..."

26:23.999 --> 26:25.999
Guys, I'm getting
ready for my party tonight, can

26:25.999 --> 26:27.999
I worry about this in, like, two
days?

26:27.999 --> 26:29.999
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:29.999 --> 26:31.999
Kim needed to deal with
it now and call you.

26:31.999 --> 26:33.999
Mom's just mad that
Caitlyn has a ticket and she

26:33.999 --> 26:36.999
doesn't.
Exactly!

26:36.999 --> 26:38.999
Okay, bye.
Yeah, you'll call her yourself.

26:38.999 --> 26:47.999
Obviously I told the
wrong human being.

26:53.999 --> 26:55.999
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday!

26:55.999 --> 26:57.999
- Thank you.
- Happy birthday.

26:57.999 --> 27:00.999
- I love your outfit.
- Tonight's my

27:00.999 --> 27:02.999
birthday.
I feel like I have a really good

27:02.999 --> 27:07.999
room of people, everyone I love.

27:07.999 --> 27:09.999
- Is Kylie even coming?
- She's supposed to.

27:09.999 --> 27:11.999
I can't believe
she's late.

27:11.999 --> 27:13.999
I can't keep track of
her today.

27:13.999 --> 27:15.999
I really hope Kylie
ends up showing up, 'cause she

27:15.999 --> 27:17.999
was a little upset earlier,
which I'm a little bummed about,

27:17.999 --> 27:19.999
just 'cause I was excited to
hang out with her.

27:26.999 --> 27:28.999
Kylie, get in here.

27:28.999 --> 27:30.999
Kylie, what the.

27:30.999 --> 27:32.999
What the  is wrong with
you?

27:32.999 --> 27:34.999
I'm kind of distracted
today because all I can think

27:34.999 --> 27:38.999
about is Tyga.
I know Kendall already invited

27:38.999 --> 27:40.999
T.
I just hope that we can make it

27:40.999 --> 27:46.999
through the night without drama.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.999
It's my first time
having alcohol in four weeks.

27:48.999 --> 27:50.999
I am ready to get this party
started.

27:50.999 --> 27:52.999
Kris  Jenner, you're
about to get your panties moist,

27:52.999 --> 27:55.999
- girl.
- Did you have your

27:55.999 --> 27:57.999
publicist announce that you are
going?

27:57.999 --> 27:59.999
- No! You can't!
- You can come to the

27:59.999 --> 28:01.999
after party!

28:05.999 --> 28:08.999
Kylie and Tyga broke

28:08.999 --> 28:12.999
up or got into a fight.
I have no idea why.

28:12.999 --> 28:15.999
It's definitely awkward to have
Kylie and Tyga both here, and

28:15.999 --> 28:19.999
we're all just, like, watching.
Kendall Nicole Jenner.

28:19.999 --> 28:22.999
Happy birthday, baby girl.

28:22.999 --> 28:25.999
We all love you.
And enjoy your life.

28:37.999 --> 28:44.999
Kylie, come on.

28:44.999 --> 28:46.999
Totally knew they'd
be fine when they saw each

28:46.999 --> 28:48.999
other.
I totally knew they'd get back

28:48.999 --> 28:52.999
together.
That's just what happens.

28:52.999 --> 29:07.999
It is what it is.

29:07.999 --> 29:11.999
Hey, babe, where...?
What kind of cups do you want?

29:11.999 --> 29:13.999
Do you want glasses, or do you
want to get cups?

29:13.999 --> 29:15.999
Yeah, I think we have
to drink champagne out of a

29:15.999 --> 29:20.999
crystal glass.
Tonight is the big night, and

29:20.999 --> 29:25.999
I'm really, really excited.
I literally don't know one thing

29:25.999 --> 29:29.999
about this party, except for
what I was supposed to wear.

29:29.999 --> 29:31.999
That's it.
Is it hot in here, or am I

29:31.999 --> 29:33.999
- having a hot flash?
- Yeah.

29:33.999 --> 29:35.999
I'm gonna go put my

29:35.999 --> 29:37.999
dress on and see what's going
on.

29:37.999 --> 29:39.999
- All right.
- Oh, wait.

29:39.999 --> 29:40.999
- My dress has to go over my head.
- Oh, God.

29:40.999 --> 29:42.999
Well, let's stop.
Just give me...

29:42.999 --> 29:44.999
Just kidding.
Just kidding.

29:44.999 --> 29:46.999
Oh.

29:46.999 --> 29:48.999
Um...

29:52.999 --> 29:55.999
You know in these
times, it was illegal to have

29:55.999 --> 29:58.999
alcohol, so, like, that's why
had, like,

29:58.999 --> 30:00.999
- these parties.
- Yeah. Oh.

30:00.999 --> 30:02.999
'Cause he was so rich,
and you were able to.

30:02.999 --> 30:04.999
- Yeah, that's cool.
- Did they have lip

30:04.999 --> 30:06.999
- injections back then?
- They didn't have

30:06.999 --> 30:10.999
alcohol, Kylie.

30:10.999 --> 30:13.999
- Hello.
- Hey, Dad.

30:13.999 --> 30:16.999
Just kidding.
Um... like, what time are you

30:16.999 --> 30:20.999
and Kris planning on leaving?
I think about 6:30.

30:20.999 --> 30:22.999
What?!
No, you're supposed to leave at,

30:22.999 --> 30:25.000
like, 8:00.
You cannot leave a second before

30:25.000 --> 30:28.999
8:00.
She cannot get to this party

30:28.999 --> 30:31.999
before her guests get there.
My mom needs to make an

30:31.999 --> 30:33.999
entrance, and we planned it
perfectly.

30:33.999 --> 30:36.999
I want to see her face.
I want to see the reaction.

30:36.999 --> 30:38.999
- Thank God I called you.
- Got you.

30:38.999 --> 30:45.999
Bye.

30:45.999 --> 30:48.999
Hi, Dad.
I'm very mad at you about

30:48.999 --> 30:50.999
something, so...
Did you publicly...?

30:50.999 --> 30:52.999
Like, did you have your
publicist announce that you were

30:52.999 --> 30:54.999
going?
Because I don't know how

30:54.999 --> 30:56.999
everyone knows, and now it's a
huge story, and I'm actually

30:56.999 --> 30:59.999
pissed at you.
Okay, well, then, you knew that

30:59.999 --> 31:01.999
was gonna happen, and I...
That's so annoying.

31:01.999 --> 31:03.999
Okay, well, then, I don't want
you to go.

31:03.999 --> 31:06.999
A lot of people assume that I
get jobs from my family, but

31:06.999 --> 31:08.999
it's actually kind of the
opposite.

31:08.999 --> 31:11.999
It made me have to work even
harder to get what I wanted, so,

31:11.999 --> 31:15.999
I get scared that if my dad
goes, that's kind of a media

31:15.999 --> 31:17.999
frenzy, and now it's kind of all
blowing up.

31:17.999 --> 31:19.999
You're gonna be... take the
biggest night of my life, and

31:19.999 --> 31:22.999
take it away from me?!
Thank you.

31:22.999 --> 31:24.999
- No, you can't!
- You can come to the

31:24.999 --> 31:29.999
after party.
You can't come.

31:29.999 --> 31:31.999
- Did Kim leave yet?
- Is she at Mom's, also?

31:31.999 --> 31:33.999
Yeah, but she was
supposed to leave for sure.

31:33.999 --> 31:35.999
Getting your dress sewn
right on you.

31:35.999 --> 31:37.999
And we're all running so late.

31:42.999 --> 31:44.999
You're gonna be...
take the biggest night of my

31:44.999 --> 31:47.999
life and take it away from me?!
Thank you.

31:47.999 --> 31:49.999
- No, you can't!
- You can come to the

31:49.999 --> 31:52.999
after party.
You can't come.

31:52.999 --> 31:55.999
I hope you're not doing this for
your own good-ass attention.

31:55.999 --> 31:59.000
You're welcome to come if you
don't  say anything, and

31:59.000 --> 32:02.999
you walk in the back door.
It's just beyond annoying.

32:02.999 --> 32:04.999
I asked everyone not to come,
and of course, you're begging me

32:04.999 --> 32:06.999
to come, making me feel like.

32:06.999 --> 32:10.999
You know I'm a pushover, so you
know I'm gonna...

32:13.999 --> 32:17.999
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
Kendall is pissed.

32:17.999 --> 32:19.999
I've already been
disinvited, so I'm just staying

32:19.999 --> 32:21.999
- out of it.
- We've all been

32:21.999 --> 32:23.999
disinvited.
It's her thing.

32:23.999 --> 32:26.999
Yeah, so, then, why
would she even let her go?

32:26.999 --> 32:29.999
- I don't think she did.
- You know what?

32:29.999 --> 32:31.999
Love you.
I'm not trying to have this

32:31.999 --> 32:34.999

32:37.999 --> 32:39.999
- You okay, Ken?
- It's just so

32:39.999 --> 32:41.999
annoying.
Literally begged me to go,

32:41.999 --> 32:43.999
'cause originally, I was saying,
"No, you can't go.

32:43.999 --> 32:45.999
I'm not letting anyone go."
And she was like, "You have to

32:45.999 --> 32:47.999
let me go!
No one will care about me."

32:47.999 --> 32:49.999
Duh, duh, duh, duh.
I'm like, "Yeah, you say that,

32:49.999 --> 32:51.999

Bruce."

32:51.999 --> 32:53.999

about Bruce being there.

43:07.999 --> 43:12.999
like this is a way to remind
myself how wonderful life can

43:12.999 --> 43:17.999
really be.

43:17.999 --> 43:19.999

Keeping Up with

I hear that you got
banned from the show.

43:23.999 --> 43:25.999
Everyone thinks I'm
the jealous sister.

43:25.999 --> 43:28.999
I can't live in my mom's
house anymore.

43:28.999 --> 43:30.999
I just want to be in my home
when I have the baby.

43:30.999 --> 43:32.999

43:32.999 --> 43:34.999
back to, like, married life?

43:40.999 --> 43:44.999
I don't want to end up in the
same situation.
