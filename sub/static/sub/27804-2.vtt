00:15.932 --> 00:18.685
[male reporter]
Join us now. Sisterhood is powerful.

00:18.768 --> 00:21.021
The battle cry
of the Women's Liberation Movement

00:21.104 --> 00:23.440
brings out down New York's Fifth Avenue

00:23.523 --> 00:28.820
as more than 10,000 militant feminists
stage a one-day strike for equal rights.

00:29.988 --> 00:33.658
[woman] In the late '60s and '70s,
the women's movement opened up

00:33.742 --> 00:37.746
a number of doors
for women to have choices

00:37.829 --> 00:39.497
to be whatever they wanted to be.

00:39.873 --> 00:43.001
Equal rights. Equal rights to have a job,
to have respect,

00:43.084 --> 00:44.794
to not be viewed as a piece of meat.

00:45.378 --> 00:47.255
[McChesney] There was
a lot more Independence,

00:47.338 --> 00:48.923
a lot more empowerment.

00:49.549 --> 00:52.886
[woman] This will continue
as a political coalition

00:52.969 --> 00:55.555
to win the unfinished revolution
of women's equality.

00:56.056 --> 00:58.349
[McChesney] Women were a lot freer.

00:58.433 --> 01:02.020
Hitchhiking, for example,
was not a big deal.

01:02.103 --> 01:06.066
But because there was
more of an open society,

01:06.691 --> 01:10.195
new types of crimes against women
became more common.

01:11.279 --> 01:15.617
And in the Pacific Northwest at the time,
there was someone...

01:15.992 --> 01:17.869
evil out there...

01:18.495 --> 01:21.581
doing really horrible things to women.

01:24.167 --> 01:28.713
[Bundy] A person of this type
chooses his victims for a reason.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.217
His victims are young attractive women.

01:33.843 --> 01:35.678
Women are possessions.

01:35.762 --> 01:39.599
Beings which are subservient,
more often than not, to males.

01:40.517 --> 01:41.768
Women are merchandise.

01:43.561 --> 01:48.066
From the pornographic, through Playboy,
right on up to the evening news.

01:49.526 --> 01:51.861
So there is no denying
the sexual component.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.072
However, sex has significance

01:54.155 --> 01:58.660
only in the context
of a much broader scheme of things.

01:59.536 --> 02:03.248
That is possession, control, violence.

02:09.170 --> 02:11.422
[theme music playing]

02:34.154 --> 02:36.781
[male reporter] Police are focused in
on their investigation into the cases

02:36.865 --> 02:39.284
of missing women in Washington State.

02:41.244 --> 02:45.123
[reporter #2] King County police launched
their investigation after Denise Naslund

02:45.206 --> 02:48.084
and Janice Ott disappeared
from Lake Sammamish State Park.

02:48.168 --> 02:51.588
A special 11-man task force
was flooded with calls from witnesses

02:52.046 --> 02:55.967
who said they had seen the suspect:
a man who called himself Ted.

02:57.135 --> 03:01.139
[man] Eight women disappeared
in and around Washington State

03:01.222 --> 03:02.974
over six months.

03:03.057 --> 03:05.643
As far as I was concerned,
it was new territory.

03:06.186 --> 03:09.772
[man] All the girls
were between the ages of 18 and 21,

03:09.856 --> 03:12.442
four of the girls attended,
were attending colleges.

03:12.942 --> 03:14.027
Same hairstyle...

03:14.527 --> 03:16.487
all very similar in appearance,

03:16.905 --> 03:20.658
and when they disappeared,
they left their personal effects.

03:21.326 --> 03:25.705
[Keppel] Everybody we could find,
anybody who'd call in, we talked to.

03:25.788 --> 03:27.290
[man] Thank you very much for calling.

03:29.250 --> 03:32.545
[man #2] Police were getting reports
that Ted was at Central State College

03:32.629 --> 03:35.632
and at the Seattle Tavern,
where two other girls had disappeared.

03:35.715 --> 03:39.636
And soon, Ted was being spotted
behind every tree, behind every bush.

03:40.511 --> 03:44.098
[McChesney]
We were working 12, 14 hours a day

03:44.182 --> 03:45.850
nearly every day of the week.

03:45.934 --> 03:49.938
We weren't sure if we had a suspect
whose name was really Ted or not,

03:50.021 --> 03:54.484
but that name
brought forth thousands of leads.

03:54.567 --> 03:58.112
We looked through databases,
driver's licenses,

03:58.196 --> 04:02.909
criminal records to see who we had
that might be Ted or Theodore.

04:02.992 --> 04:06.079
Middle name, first name, uh, nickname.

04:06.621 --> 04:12.210
We were also looking for someone
driving a light brown Volkswagen Bug.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.338
[Keppel] I don't know
if you know how many Bugs

04:15.421 --> 04:18.675
there were in the State of Washington
during that time.

04:19.133 --> 04:20.301
You wanna guess?

04:20.927 --> 04:22.762
Forty-two thousand.

04:22.845 --> 04:24.681
That's what we were dealing with.

04:25.306 --> 04:27.308
Masses of information.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.687
[McChesney]
We started with literally 1,000 names.

04:31.437 --> 04:35.108
Then we looked at suspects
who we had maybe of the name of Ted

04:35.191 --> 04:36.567
who drove that kind of a car,

04:36.651 --> 04:40.571
whom perhaps people had reported
as being a little strange.

04:40.655 --> 04:42.615
We put all those things together

04:42.699 --> 04:48.830
and we narrowed the number
of potential offenders down to 100.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.417
But at that time,

04:52.500 --> 04:57.880
we didn't have enough resources
to manage the data quickly.

04:58.172 --> 04:59.716
Everything was slow.

05:00.758 --> 05:03.803
[man] This is a little different
than, uh, most homicide cases.

05:03.886 --> 05:09.350
We have witnesses that observed
our suspect, quote, "Ted."

05:09.434 --> 05:11.311
I think one of these days we'll find him.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.855
I don't--
I can't tell you when, but we will.

05:26.617 --> 05:31.039
[man] After several weeks
of conversations with Ted on death row,

05:31.122 --> 05:33.416
when he started
talking in the third person,

05:33.499 --> 05:34.834
that was the breakthrough.

05:34.917 --> 05:37.462
Our relationship changed
at that moment...

05:38.713 --> 05:42.592
from me being
just another goddamn reporter

05:42.675 --> 05:48.014
to me being the conduit for Ted
being able to finally tell this story.

05:48.639 --> 05:51.309
[Bundy]
Now let's consider the possibility

05:51.392 --> 05:55.104
that this person suffered
from some sort of acute onset

05:55.188 --> 05:58.983
of a desire
that resulted in killing young women.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.443
How do you account for it?

06:01.194 --> 06:03.321
[Michaud]
Ted started laying out the history

06:03.404 --> 06:06.991
of what he
would soon come to call "the entity."

06:07.408 --> 06:09.577
At its start, it's just a feeling.

06:09.660 --> 06:12.413
First, this individual,
as he called himself,

06:12.497 --> 06:14.874
developed a pornography habit.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.920
[Bundy] The early manifestations
of this condition,

06:19.003 --> 06:21.839
which is an interest
concerning sexual images.

06:21.923 --> 06:22.882
[Michaud] Mm-hmm.

06:22.965 --> 06:25.009
[Bundy] Your standard fare
that you'd see in the movie house

06:25.093 --> 06:26.761
or in Playboy magazine.

06:27.261 --> 06:31.015
[Michaud] Gradually, this kind
of malign part of this individual

06:31.099 --> 06:32.517
started connecting...

06:33.226 --> 06:35.645
naked women with violence.

06:36.104 --> 06:40.483
[Bundy] The interest becomes skewed
toward a more specialized literature--

06:40.566 --> 06:41.734
some of it pretty grotesque,

06:41.818 --> 06:44.278
which would preoccupy him
more and more.

06:45.321 --> 06:48.074
I asked him,
"When does this individual first act out?"

06:48.741 --> 06:49.992
[Bundy] It would reach a point

06:50.076 --> 06:54.872
where the anger, the frustration,
the anxiety, the poor self-image

06:54.956 --> 06:58.334
feeling cheated, wronged, insecure...

06:59.127 --> 07:03.464
he decides upon young attractive women
being his victims.

07:06.175 --> 07:10.930
The feeling grew and grew
until the entity controlled him,

07:11.013 --> 07:12.723
and he would hear a voice

07:13.266 --> 07:16.769
and he did as the entity told him to do.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.523
[Bundy] One particular evening,

07:20.606 --> 07:22.650
he was driving down a fairly dark street,

07:22.733 --> 07:25.445
and saw a girl walking along the street.

07:25.570 --> 07:28.406
And parked his car
and ran up behind the girl

07:28.489 --> 07:31.993
and she heard him, she turned around,
and he brandished the knife,

07:32.076 --> 07:34.662
and grabbed her by the arm,

07:34.745 --> 07:37.874
and told her to do what wanted her to do.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.877
When he really got going,
his eyes went absolutely black.

07:41.252 --> 07:43.421
He had very blue eyes,

07:43.754 --> 07:46.174
but his eyes would go black.

07:46.883 --> 07:49.218
[Bundy] Let's say he placed his hands
around her throat

07:49.594 --> 07:53.389
just to throttle her into unconsciousness
so that she wouldn't scream anymore.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.892
When the need
of that malignant condition

07:55.975 --> 07:58.352
had been satisfied
through sexual release,

07:58.436 --> 08:01.230
he realized
that he couldn't let the girl go.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.524
So killing, to a degree,

08:03.608 --> 08:06.402
will become a way of destroying evidence.

08:07.028 --> 08:10.114
But the act of killing
becomes an end in itself.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.702
[indistinct chatter]

08:18.289 --> 08:21.834
[man] Steven had got Ted
talking in the third person.

08:22.376 --> 08:24.587
So we had a meeting, the three of us.

08:25.004 --> 08:27.298
It was very strange, sitting...

08:27.840 --> 08:28.925
a few feet...

08:29.383 --> 08:31.677
three feet from a... guy like that.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.805
He would not look me
in the eye very often.

08:35.973 --> 08:38.768
I found myself,
and this sort of strange...

08:39.268 --> 08:42.271
I would almost be mesmerized
for a few moments...

08:42.813 --> 08:44.315
looking at his hands.

08:44.774 --> 08:48.569
Thinking, "My God,
what did those hands do?"

08:59.956 --> 09:02.041
[McChesney] After approximately a month,

09:02.542 --> 09:04.460
there was nothing new really coming in.

09:04.544 --> 09:05.670
[indistinct chatter]

09:05.753 --> 09:08.422
Okay, what address does she have?

09:08.798 --> 09:11.842
[McChesney] The big leap came
when we received a call from a woman

09:11.926 --> 09:15.513
who said,
"I'm concerned about my boyfriend

09:15.930 --> 09:19.016
named Ted Bundy,
whom you should look at."

09:19.850 --> 09:25.147
[young Keppel] This will be an interview
with Elizabeth Kloepfer. K-L-O-E-P-F-E-R.

09:26.357 --> 09:28.484
Are you aware
that this interview is being taped?

09:28.568 --> 09:29.402
[Kloepfer] Yes.

09:29.485 --> 09:32.196
-[Keppel] Is it taped with your approval?
-Yes.

09:32.613 --> 09:35.283
[Michaud] Ted and Liz
had a very complex relationship.

09:35.783 --> 09:38.411
Their relationship
had started rocking back and forth,

09:38.494 --> 09:40.663
and it left Liz in a real mess.

09:41.372 --> 09:44.417
There were these hints
that there was something deeper

09:44.500 --> 09:47.878
and more complex about Ted
than she had previously suspected.

09:48.588 --> 09:52.466
[Kloepfer] Uh, he... mentioned an incident

09:52.550 --> 09:54.468
about following a sorority girl.

09:54.552 --> 09:57.305
When he was out late at night,
he would follow people like that.

09:58.139 --> 10:00.016
That he'd try not to, but--

10:00.099 --> 10:02.768
but he just did it anyway.

10:03.227 --> 10:05.479
[Michaud] She found a bag
of women's underclothing

10:05.563 --> 10:06.897
in his apartment.

10:06.981 --> 10:09.859
She found a bowl filled with house keys.

10:10.234 --> 10:13.696
There was some plaster of Paris
and some bandages.

10:13.779 --> 10:18.242
Another time she found a knife
under the right front seat of his car.

10:19.535 --> 10:22.580
[Kloepfer] The night
that Brenda Ball... disappeared,

10:22.997 --> 10:25.166
he'd been with me and my family,

10:25.249 --> 10:28.044
and he left early in the evening
and then the next day was late to my...

10:28.544 --> 10:29.920
daughter's baptism.

10:30.338 --> 10:33.090
And then he said,
"It's pretty scary, isn't it?"

10:34.175 --> 10:37.053
[McChesney] She reported
suspicious behavior on his part,

10:37.136 --> 10:39.263
and she was, frankly, afraid.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.265
But she was not certain.

10:41.807 --> 10:43.351
[Kloepfer] In my own mind,

10:43.434 --> 10:46.270
there were coincidences
that seemed to tie him in.

10:46.354 --> 10:49.190
Yet when I would think
about our day-to-day relationship,

10:49.982 --> 10:52.360
there was nothing there
that would lead me to think

10:52.443 --> 10:55.863
that he was a violent man
capable of doing something like that.

10:58.282 --> 11:00.451
[McChesney] We had a lot of women
who called and said,

11:00.534 --> 11:03.913
"I'm concerned
that my boyfriend might be this offender."

11:03.996 --> 11:05.623
Whether his name was Ted or not.

11:06.457 --> 11:08.793
But this Ted was about the right age,

11:08.876 --> 11:11.295
he was
about the right physical description.

11:11.379 --> 11:14.256
He was familiar
with the University of Washington

11:14.340 --> 11:16.467
because he lived
in the university district.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.595
He did have that kind of a car.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.473
So there were a lot of things
that started to add up.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.518
[Keppel] We even found information

11:25.601 --> 11:29.730
that this Ted had been
to Lake Sammamish State Park

11:29.814 --> 11:33.693
the weekend before
the Lake Sammamish event happened.

11:34.443 --> 11:37.405
[McChesney] So, where was Ted Bundy

11:37.822 --> 11:41.450
on these various days
when those women went missing?

11:41.534 --> 11:45.996
Was he anywhere where somebody
could provide an alibi for him?

11:46.997 --> 11:50.126
As it turned out,
as we continued to look at his life,

11:50.751 --> 11:52.211
there wasn't any alibi.

11:52.294 --> 11:55.965
So Ted was a... absolutely prime suspect.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.467
[Bundy] After Lake Sammamish,

11:58.551 --> 12:02.471
they were working from a list
of hundreds upon hundreds of leads.

12:03.055 --> 12:06.100
So the emphasis becomes
on don't get caught.

12:06.475 --> 12:09.395
Then it becomes a matter
of disposing of the problem...

12:09.979 --> 12:12.064
without leaving any, uh, evidence.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.777
[man] They finally had
their first possible suspect.

12:17.194 --> 12:18.028
At that point,

12:18.112 --> 12:20.406
the captain of Seattle homicide,

12:20.489 --> 12:23.033
he had me do some ride-alongs
with some of his detectives,

12:23.117 --> 12:25.661
staking out a suspect
at the University of Washington.

12:26.495 --> 12:28.497
I was in the back seat
of an undercover car

12:28.581 --> 12:31.917
with two plain-clothed policemen
staking out somebody.

12:32.918 --> 12:34.545
We just sat there all night long

12:35.045 --> 12:36.714
on a radio, listening for...

12:37.131 --> 12:40.301
any movement of his car,
and there never was.

12:40.760 --> 12:44.930
And I didn't know at the time, in fact,
didn't realize until some time later,

12:45.014 --> 12:46.640
it was Ted Bundy's car.

12:49.351 --> 12:52.855
[McChesney] At that point,
we did have a photograph of Ted.

12:52.938 --> 12:55.608
and we prepared photo lineups
and showed to witnesses

12:55.691 --> 12:57.193
who had been
at Lake Sammamish Park.

12:58.194 --> 13:01.530
[reporter] The photograph of Ted Bundy
was shown to at least eight witnesses

13:01.614 --> 13:03.073
from Lake Sammamish.

13:03.157 --> 13:08.204
Seven positively said
Ted Bundy was not the mysterious Ted.

13:09.497 --> 13:13.292
[McChesney] It was a surprise
that they felt that it was not him.

13:14.293 --> 13:18.130
So, we didn't have
definitive identification

13:18.214 --> 13:21.425
that this indeed was the person
who had committed these crimes.

13:22.551 --> 13:24.261
But I certainly wish that we had.

13:26.597 --> 13:30.267
There were no fingerprints.
There were no eyewitnesses.

13:30.351 --> 13:33.896
There was nothing physically
that would connect Ted to the crimes.

13:34.313 --> 13:36.232
They had nothing to charge him with.

13:36.315 --> 13:39.944
Ted was never brought in
for an official police interview.

13:40.611 --> 13:42.738
[Bundy]
I suppose they could be faulted for not...

13:42.822 --> 13:44.865
actually coming out and talking to me,

13:44.949 --> 13:47.034
but on the other hand
they can't be faulted.

13:47.493 --> 13:48.786
Which one are they gonna pick,

13:48.869 --> 13:51.455
the law student
with no criminal background

13:51.539 --> 13:54.708
or are they going to go after
the guy with the...

13:54.792 --> 13:58.003
arrest record for robbery,
or you know, the types?

13:58.087 --> 13:59.588
The real weirdos.

14:00.589 --> 14:04.343
People don't realize that murderers
do not come out in the dark

14:04.426 --> 14:07.680
with long teeth
and saliva dripping off their chin.

14:09.431 --> 14:13.727
Everybody wanted this Ted
to be somebody you could pick out.

14:14.103 --> 14:15.604
He wasn't that way.

14:16.647 --> 14:20.067
[Keppel] We didn't have
any information at that time

14:20.150 --> 14:22.236
that we could have charged Bundy
with murder.

14:22.778 --> 14:24.822
That's what people don't understand.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.993
[female reporter]
Where does this investigation now stand?

14:29.076 --> 14:32.538
Police officials will not discuss
this King County investigation

14:32.621 --> 14:34.623
because it is still an active case.

14:35.416 --> 14:38.043
No one will or can confirm

14:38.127 --> 14:41.630
that the investigation
continues on other suspects.

14:43.632 --> 14:45.384
[McChesney] In any investigation,

14:45.467 --> 14:49.096
you will reach some point
where you run out of leads.

14:49.597 --> 14:52.933
So we stopped
the full task force at that point.

14:55.102 --> 14:59.064
But there was also the fact
that the murders had seemed to stop.

14:59.648 --> 15:02.902
So we didn't know
if the person had died,

15:02.985 --> 15:05.821
had left the area, had just stopped...

15:06.447 --> 15:08.032
committing these crimes on their own.

15:08.657 --> 15:10.242
[male reporter]
What it was evident this spring

15:10.326 --> 15:12.661
that the investigation
had reached a dead end,

15:12.745 --> 15:15.205
police admitted
that they could only catch Ted

15:15.289 --> 15:17.708
if he committed another crime
and got caught.

15:36.602 --> 15:37.895
[Bundy] I loved Utah.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.773
I decided that I was moving down there

15:40.856 --> 15:42.900
in September of '74.

15:44.485 --> 15:48.322
Hopped on the interstate
going south toward Provo.

15:49.406 --> 15:52.409
All of a sudden I felt--
I felt almost euphoric.

15:53.160 --> 15:56.121
I just looked out the window
and watched the scenery and...

15:56.580 --> 15:59.166
dreamed and reminisced and...

15:59.249 --> 16:02.711
generally maintained
a real good feeling I had

16:02.795 --> 16:04.713
all the way into Utah.

16:07.424 --> 16:10.761
Ted moved to Salt Lake City
to start law school

16:10.844 --> 16:12.805
at the University of Utah.

16:13.597 --> 16:19.436
I did not understand
why Ted went off to Utah for law school.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.147
I advised him to go
to University of Puget Sound.

16:22.856 --> 16:24.817
'Cause that was the school
I was going to.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.444
But he was insistent

16:27.528 --> 16:30.906
and I was surprised
that he went off to Utah.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.117
[Bundy]
We are dealing with an individual

16:33.200 --> 16:36.704
whose primary concern
is not to be detected.

16:37.121 --> 16:39.456
The individual's modus operandi was

16:39.540 --> 16:42.960
-moving large amounts of distance...
-Mm-hmm.

16:43.043 --> 16:45.170
...in an attempt
to camouflage what he was doing.

16:45.671 --> 16:48.382
And that he was also
able to take advantage

16:48.465 --> 16:50.009
of the anonymity factor.

16:51.468 --> 16:53.762
[Michaud] The Ted people saw in Utah

16:53.846 --> 16:56.515
was pretty much the same
mild-mannered law student

16:56.598 --> 16:58.851
that he projected
in the State of Washington.

16:59.309 --> 17:01.645
And that's what Ted did,
he snowed people.

17:06.483 --> 17:09.778
[man] Ted Bundy befriended me in 1974.

17:11.030 --> 17:15.534
I was what we call a branch president
in the Mormon church.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.330
One day, two members in our branch

17:20.414 --> 17:23.125
had knocked on the door of, uh, Ted Bundy.

17:24.460 --> 17:27.254
They got talking
and he expressed an interest.

17:28.422 --> 17:31.050
Eventually,
he became a member of the church.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.342
He was baptized...

17:33.093 --> 17:35.095
and then he was placed in our branch.

17:35.179 --> 17:37.347
♪ Put your shoulder to the wheel... ♪

17:37.431 --> 17:40.267
[Bundy] He's probably so caught up
in living a dual life that...

17:40.350 --> 17:43.812
he'd been enmeshed
in that continuing cycle

17:43.896 --> 17:45.898
of trying to maintain a normal life.

17:46.690 --> 17:48.692
He would modify his behavior

17:48.776 --> 17:52.571
to make him a sound, stable,
law-abiding individual.

17:54.656 --> 17:57.284
[Preece]
I felt that he was a handsome young man

17:57.367 --> 17:59.828
that seemed to have his life
pretty much in order.

18:00.954 --> 18:02.289
He came to the activities.

18:02.372 --> 18:04.458
He came to the church meetings and, uh...

18:04.875 --> 18:06.710
responded in a positive way.

18:06.794 --> 18:09.630
So I thought that things were
good for him for the future.

18:16.845 --> 18:19.765
[woman] Summer of '74 was just fun.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.475
A fun summer.

18:24.061 --> 18:25.145
I was 18.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.064
Graduated from high school

18:27.147 --> 18:30.776
and got a job at the local phone company.

18:31.652 --> 18:34.696
I had gotten a car, '74 Camaro.

18:34.780 --> 18:38.575
Maroon with black leather seats
and a black top.

18:38.659 --> 18:39.660
[laughs]

18:39.743 --> 18:44.498
And I just started dating a guy
who had a matching Camaro.

18:45.332 --> 18:46.750
Everything was great.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.752
I wasn't worried about anything.

18:50.462 --> 18:55.050
And then I heard about a girl
in a city next door, Midvale.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.010
She had been found murdered.

18:58.428 --> 19:00.848
She was a police chief's daughter.

19:01.431 --> 19:03.433
It was very alarming,

19:03.517 --> 19:08.397
but there wasn't a lot of information
to cause me to be in a panic.

19:10.315 --> 19:11.984
[reporter] Melissa Smith left her father

19:12.067 --> 19:14.361
to meet a friend
at this Midvale restaurant.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.156
They talked for a while
and then Melissa left.

19:17.239 --> 19:19.783
She set for home. She never got there.

19:20.534 --> 19:23.745
Nine days later, Melissa's body
was found in Summit County.

19:24.204 --> 19:27.124
She had been beaten
and strangled with a nylon stocking.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.960
I don't want another parent

19:30.043 --> 19:32.504
to go through
what my wife and I went through.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.256
I don't think that's right.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.133
I want to know that--

19:36.508 --> 19:38.802
that the young girls
are safe on the street.

19:41.138 --> 19:43.599
[Michaud] In the Autumn of 1974,

19:43.682 --> 19:47.394
there were two other disappearances
in the state of Utah.

19:48.604 --> 19:52.566
Nancy Wilcox vanished
after leaving her house.

19:53.275 --> 19:54.776
Her body was never found.

19:55.861 --> 19:58.405
Another girl
by the name of Laura Aime

19:58.488 --> 20:02.993
also vanished and was later found
in the Wasatch Mountains.

20:03.535 --> 20:06.079
She had been bludgeoned and raped.

20:07.831 --> 20:09.625
[man] People were very very worried.

20:10.709 --> 20:14.087
I was the assistant prosecutor,

20:14.171 --> 20:16.340
uh, for the Salt Lake County
Attorney's Office.

20:17.257 --> 20:22.596
The number of missing and dead girls
was certainly an unusual occurrence.

20:23.388 --> 20:28.602
We didn't connect our cases
to the missing girls in the Seattle area.

20:28.685 --> 20:31.104
You wouldn't ever think
in your wildest dreams

20:31.188 --> 20:34.524
there was a serial killer
in the community.

20:42.783 --> 20:47.996
[DaRonch]
November 8, 1974. It was a Friday.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.624
I didn't really have plans that night.

20:50.707 --> 20:55.128
So I decided that I would get in my car
and head over for the mall.

20:57.422 --> 20:59.466
I drove to the parking lot,

20:59.549 --> 21:00.968
parked under a light,

21:01.051 --> 21:02.970
and walked into the mall.

21:05.180 --> 21:07.224
Started looking in a bookstore window.

21:08.392 --> 21:11.979
And as I was looking in the window,
a man approached me.

21:12.980 --> 21:15.023
He said he was a police officer.

21:15.649 --> 21:19.987
He said, "Well, we found someone
trying to break into your car."

21:20.862 --> 21:22.322
He was polite.

21:22.406 --> 21:25.367
He asked me if I wanted
to come out to the car with him

21:25.450 --> 21:27.160
and see if anything was missing.

21:27.828 --> 21:30.831
So we got out to my car,
and I could see in the car

21:30.914 --> 21:32.374
that nothing was missing.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.584
And he kept leaning forward
like he wanted me

21:34.668 --> 21:37.546
to look further in the car,
but I wouldn't.

21:37.629 --> 21:39.172
I just said, "Nothing's missing."

21:40.007 --> 21:43.218
And that's when he said,
"Well, they're holding this guy

21:43.302 --> 21:45.053
down at the police station.

21:45.554 --> 21:48.307
Do you have time
to come down there

21:48.390 --> 21:50.726
and fill out a complaint against him?"

21:51.351 --> 21:54.730
And then I said,
"Do you have some kind of identification?"

21:54.813 --> 21:58.442
'Cause I-- I just was starting
to feel a little uneasy

21:58.525 --> 22:00.736
and I thought I could smell alcohol.

22:00.819 --> 22:03.447
And that's when he just promptly
pulled out his wallet

22:03.530 --> 22:05.115
and showed me a badge,

22:05.198 --> 22:07.034
and I went, "Oh, okay."

22:07.617 --> 22:09.328
He drove a Volkswagen,

22:09.411 --> 22:12.831
which I thought, "Well, that's
kind of odd, but maybe he's undercover."

22:13.790 --> 22:15.292
And I got in.

22:16.043 --> 22:18.712
He headed down a side street...

22:19.421 --> 22:21.882
and then he suddenly pulled over

22:21.965 --> 22:25.385
up on the side of a curb
by an elementary school.

22:26.178 --> 22:29.931
And that's when I just started
freaking out, "What are we doing?"

22:30.474 --> 22:32.100
And he grabbed my arm

22:32.184 --> 22:35.228
and he got one handcuff on one wrist,

22:35.312 --> 22:38.940
and he didn't get the other one on,
and the one was just dangling.

22:39.024 --> 22:42.861
I had never been so frightened
in my entire life.

22:44.863 --> 22:48.700
And I know this is cliché,
but my whole life went before my eyes.

22:50.827 --> 22:54.915
I thought, "My God, my parents are
never gonna know what happened to me."

22:55.749 --> 22:58.168
The next thing I knew,
he had pulled out a gun

22:58.251 --> 22:59.795
and said, "I'll blow your head off."

23:00.879 --> 23:04.424
I just thought, "Go ahead. Just go ahead.

23:04.508 --> 23:06.259
Do it. Just kill me now."

23:06.927 --> 23:09.805
But I just found the door,
jumped out of the car.

23:09.888 --> 23:13.558
He came out after me,
and we struggled outside.

23:13.642 --> 23:17.062
He had a crowbar.
He was trying to hit me over the head.

23:17.437 --> 23:19.648
I had my hand on top.
I could feel it.

23:19.731 --> 23:23.610
I just fought with all my might,
thrashing with him and fighting.

23:23.693 --> 23:25.695
My fingers nails were all broken.

23:25.779 --> 23:29.324
I remember
his beady, blank, lifeless eyes.

23:35.372 --> 23:38.834
At that time, a car started coming
the other direction.

23:38.917 --> 23:41.461
And that's when I broke loose
and ran to the car

23:42.546 --> 23:45.799
I flew open their door
and jumped in on them,

23:45.882 --> 23:49.803
and I said,
"Take me to the police station."

23:49.886 --> 23:52.013
I was just hysterical.

23:54.808 --> 23:59.146
I was very lucky and it was
really shocking to find out later

23:59.229 --> 24:02.524
that he was so angry
that I had gotten away

24:02.607 --> 24:05.986
he just drove somewhere else
and killed someone else.

24:12.534 --> 24:15.620
[reporter] Debra Kent was attending a play
with Viewmont High School.

24:16.329 --> 24:18.748
She left the play early
to pick up her brother.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.001
Debbie never got to her car.

24:22.335 --> 24:25.297
The same night
that Carol DaRonch was kidnapped,

24:26.089 --> 24:30.260
Debbie Kent was abducted
in a parking lot north of Salt Lake.

24:31.470 --> 24:35.182
Found in the parking lot
was a handcuff key.

24:36.433 --> 24:40.729
And the key fit my handcuff
that I had had on me.

24:40.812 --> 24:43.398
[reporter] Police believe the key
was from the same handcuffs

24:43.482 --> 24:46.109
used to kidnap Carol DaRonch

24:46.193 --> 24:49.863
four hours earlier, the same night
Debbie Kent disappeared.

24:51.198 --> 24:54.659
[Michaud]
Now there's a witness and real evidence.

24:54.743 --> 24:57.412
The police are starting
to make connections.

25:06.213 --> 25:07.714
[McChesney]
It had been a number of months,

25:07.797 --> 25:11.259
and we had run out of leads to pursue

25:11.343 --> 25:13.803
for the missing women
in the State of Washington.

25:14.304 --> 25:18.975
So, sometimes you have to rely
on people who might...

25:19.726 --> 25:21.228
by circumstance,

25:21.311 --> 25:23.021
find something.

25:26.107 --> 25:28.443
[Lucas] I got a call from a friend
in the police department.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.362
And he said,
"Get your butt up to Taylor Mountain."

25:30.445 --> 25:32.572
I said, "What's going on?"
And he said, "Just go."

25:33.240 --> 25:36.117
So I went up there with some
of the Seattle homicide detectives,

25:36.201 --> 25:39.162
and, uh, they told me
that they had found bodies.

25:40.080 --> 25:42.832
[Keppel]
It was a group of student foresters

25:42.916 --> 25:45.961
marking trees on Taylor Mountain,

25:46.044 --> 25:49.506
and they found the skull of Brenda Ball,

25:50.131 --> 25:51.132
laying in the woods.

25:55.345 --> 25:57.430
They called the Sheriff's Office

25:57.514 --> 26:02.477
and we began a search ourselves
with our own search and rescue volunteers.

26:02.561 --> 26:08.817
And we discovered, a hundred feet apart,
the remains of three other women.

26:09.234 --> 26:11.194
It was pretty much of a nightmare.

26:14.906 --> 26:17.033
[young Keppel]
We keep finding more and more everyday.

26:17.117 --> 26:19.703
You get into that woods
and you just don't know what's in there.

26:19.786 --> 26:23.331
It's so thick
and so overgrown with bushes...

26:23.915 --> 26:26.084
that you could find anything,
you know...

26:26.418 --> 26:28.712
uh, a couple of hours from now
or five minutes from now.

26:28.795 --> 26:29.629
It doesn't matter.

26:37.137 --> 26:41.141
[Michaud] What do you think
can be surmised about Taylor Mountain?

26:41.808 --> 26:45.061
[Bundy]
About the Taylor Mountain crime scene?

26:46.187 --> 26:48.398
We can make a reasonable guess...

26:49.274 --> 26:52.777
that this individual was clearly trying
to cover up his crimes.

26:54.070 --> 26:55.447
When a body was left there,

26:55.530 --> 26:58.617
the animals in the area were doing,
you know,

26:58.700 --> 27:00.160
his work for him.

27:00.243 --> 27:01.953
And he would continue to go back there

27:02.037 --> 27:04.456
simply because he had
his own garbage disposal.

27:06.166 --> 27:09.544
[reporter] Remains of six missing girls
were found at the same site.

27:09.628 --> 27:13.089
The skeletal remains
of 21-year-old Linda Ann Healy,

27:13.173 --> 27:16.051
22-year-old Brenda Ball of Seattle,

27:16.134 --> 27:19.929
18-year-old Susan Elaine Rancourt
of Anchorage, Alaska,

27:20.013 --> 27:24.851
and 20-year-old Roberta Kathleen Parks
from Lafayette, California.

27:24.934 --> 27:28.271
Just a few miles away from the place
where those four were found,

27:28.563 --> 27:31.316
police identified
two other murdered girls.

27:31.399 --> 27:35.070
These two disappeared from the same place,
Lake Sammamish State Park.

27:35.153 --> 27:37.280
They were 23-year-old Janice Ott...

27:38.073 --> 27:40.533
and 18-year-old Denise Naslund.

27:43.119 --> 27:46.956
[McChesney] The women were abducted
from entirely different locations,

27:47.040 --> 27:50.502
but were ultimately found
up at Taylor Mountain.

27:51.002 --> 27:53.421
And so, at that point,

27:53.505 --> 27:55.006
we were quite sure that...

27:55.799 --> 27:59.260
the women who had been missing
and the women who had been found

27:59.344 --> 28:01.805
were all killed by the same person.

28:04.557 --> 28:08.853
I began reporting
that this person was a serial killer.

28:09.562 --> 28:11.439
So-- I think we were the first station

28:11.523 --> 28:13.942
that began making that assumption
on the air.

28:14.359 --> 28:16.778
Other reporters
then began jumping on the story.

28:17.320 --> 28:21.199
[reporter] And Mackie, the Taylor Mountain
is sort of known as a lover's lane.

28:21.282 --> 28:24.119
There's evidence to indicate it
if you look around the ground.

28:25.286 --> 28:28.206
-Can you be a bit more specific, please?
-Can you formulate any hypothesis--

28:28.289 --> 28:33.837
Can you formulate an hypothesis
that maybe this-- the subject, uh,

28:33.920 --> 28:35.839
was first a lover, then a killer?

28:36.756 --> 28:37.716
Well...

28:38.633 --> 28:41.386
you can conjecture all you want on that,

28:41.469 --> 28:45.640
but the problem that we have
in this-- these cases, is--

28:46.015 --> 28:49.477
is different than most homicide cases.
We don't know the way they were killed.

28:49.561 --> 28:53.273
So it's pretty hard to make
any judgment on this at all...

28:53.815 --> 28:56.943
of how they were killed,
because all we've found is bones.

28:59.696 --> 29:02.407
[McChesney] The remains
were found scattered apart,

29:02.490 --> 29:05.034
affected and impacted by animals.

29:05.118 --> 29:08.079
We didn't have the technology
that we have now.

29:08.163 --> 29:11.082
We didn't have the DNA capabilities.

29:12.125 --> 29:15.628
[young Keppel] The evidence that we
had initially found on our bodies...

29:16.713 --> 29:18.548
was almost non-existent

29:18.631 --> 29:21.926
It kind of sounds morbid to say this,
but we were hoping for another body

29:22.010 --> 29:23.595
with more evidence on it

29:23.678 --> 29:26.139
than what we could produce
from the ones we had.

29:27.140 --> 29:29.768
[McChesney]
We still didn't have an offender named,

29:29.851 --> 29:32.520
and it was still quite a mystery.

29:36.232 --> 29:38.234
[birds chirping]

29:42.113 --> 29:43.615
[Lucas] After working in Seattle,

29:43.698 --> 29:46.576
I got the job with the TV station
in Denver, Colorado.

29:46.951 --> 29:49.829
When I got there,
I realized that, by coincidence,

29:49.913 --> 29:52.499
there was also a problem
with missing and murdered women

29:52.582 --> 29:53.750
throughout Colorado.

29:57.670 --> 30:01.591
I felt that I was following
this trail of terror

30:01.674 --> 30:03.968
from the northwest to Colorado.

30:04.052 --> 30:09.015
On January 12th, 1975, Caryn Campbell
disappeared from the Wildwood Inn.

30:10.517 --> 30:13.853
[man] Caryn Campbell was
a young woman on vacation

30:13.937 --> 30:17.357
with her fiancé, I believe,
and his children.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.901
[female reporter]
Caryn Campbell sat with her fiancé,

30:19.984 --> 30:21.236
Dr. Raymond Gadowski,

30:21.319 --> 30:23.947
in front of a fire in the lobby
of the Wildwood Inn.

30:24.030 --> 30:26.950
They had just finished dinner
at a restaurant, The Stew Pot.

30:27.033 --> 30:29.285
Miss Campbell
wanted a magazine from her room.

30:29.369 --> 30:31.788
About eight o'clock in the evening,
she caught the elevator

30:31.871 --> 30:32.872
to the second floor.

30:32.956 --> 30:36.084
That was the last time
Gadowski saw her alive.

30:38.169 --> 30:42.924
Thirty-six days later, her nude body
was found almost three miles away.

30:43.007 --> 30:45.844
Though the body was partially
destroyed by animals,

30:45.927 --> 30:49.055
the coroner was able to establish
that Miss Campbell had died

30:49.138 --> 30:53.184
about two hours after the dinner
at The Stew Pot on January 12th.

30:54.602 --> 30:56.271
[Leidner] Caryn Campbell's family

30:56.354 --> 30:58.690
must have gone
through all kinds of anguish.

30:59.357 --> 31:01.067
Her body was found...

31:01.818 --> 31:05.947
and it had been out there
for the greater part of the winter.

31:06.614 --> 31:09.742
I can't imagine how they dealt with it.
I cannot imagine.

31:11.744 --> 31:15.582
It was a big deal, because murders
didn't happen in Aspen.

31:17.959 --> 31:21.629
And then there were at least
two other killings in Colorado.

31:22.088 --> 31:23.798
[male reporter]
Two more women have gone missing.

31:23.882 --> 31:27.051
Julie Cunningham,
a 26-year-old woman from Vale,

31:27.135 --> 31:31.097
and Denise Oliverson,
a 24-year-old from Grand Junction.

31:31.389 --> 31:33.349
Their whereabouts are unknown.

31:34.601 --> 31:38.897
They both vanished without a witness,
without a sign, without anything.

31:39.814 --> 31:42.233
[reporter] Colorado authorities
now add to their growing list

31:42.317 --> 31:43.818
of missing and murdered women.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.571
A coroner's report concludes
that it is possible

31:47.071 --> 31:49.240
the same person killed these women.

31:50.116 --> 31:53.286
Somebody was getting away with murders.
Many murders.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.038
It had all of the elements

31:55.121 --> 31:57.582
of what we feared
was going on in the northwest.

31:58.333 --> 32:00.835
That was a pattern that somebody
should have looked at.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.254
But these various police departments...

32:03.338 --> 32:05.506
they weren't sharing information
across state lines.

32:05.590 --> 32:08.593
[Bundy] The inherent shortcomings
of law enforcement

32:08.676 --> 32:10.428
make the detection of crime

32:10.929 --> 32:15.475
and the solution of crime
an extremely difficult process.

32:15.558 --> 32:18.686
Defects in our system of law enforcement

32:18.770 --> 32:21.314
permit the individual to get away with it.

32:24.525 --> 32:28.488
[Michaud] Ted had pride in what he did.
He really thought of himself as a hunter,

32:28.947 --> 32:30.198
and he took big game,

32:30.531 --> 32:33.785
and he felt that he had achieved
something really special...

32:34.494 --> 32:36.079
that nobody else had done

32:36.829 --> 32:38.539
because he was so damn good at it.

32:49.717 --> 32:51.594
[DaRonch] Almost a year later,

32:51.678 --> 32:55.056
the police had no suspect
in my kidnapping.

32:56.349 --> 32:57.642
I thought about it all the time.

32:57.725 --> 33:00.645
I thought, "Why can't they find this man?"

33:01.437 --> 33:05.650
The police watched my house constantly,
drove past all the time.

33:06.234 --> 33:10.321
My dad slept
with his deer hunting rifle under his bed.

33:11.698 --> 33:13.992
I tried to move on with my life,

33:14.492 --> 33:17.203
but it was always in the back of my mind,

33:17.286 --> 33:19.998
"Where is this guy?
Why can't they catch him?"

33:25.003 --> 33:27.922
[Yocom] One night,
a highway patrolman, Bob Hayward,

33:28.297 --> 33:31.217
was in a residential area
around Salt Lake City.

33:31.300 --> 33:33.886
And he saw this VW automobile

33:33.970 --> 33:36.597
driving down the street
with its lights off.

33:36.681 --> 33:39.976
He became very suspicious
and tried to stop the vehicle.

33:40.727 --> 33:42.812
It ran from him and he chased it...

33:43.271 --> 33:45.940
and finally stopped it and pulled it over.

33:46.816 --> 33:49.527
[Bundy] It was a freak occurrence
that brought me in contact with Hayward

33:49.610 --> 33:51.571
at two o'clock in the morning.

33:51.654 --> 33:53.156
We're talking about luck.

33:53.740 --> 33:56.200
[Yocom] The driver was arrested
for failing to stop

33:56.284 --> 33:57.744
at the command a police officer.

34:00.830 --> 34:03.166
He was identified as Ted Bundy.

34:04.834 --> 34:08.796
[man] Mr. Bundy wanted to hire a lawyer,
so he called me and said,

34:08.880 --> 34:11.299
"I've been arrested,
and I need to see a lawyer."

34:11.382 --> 34:12.967
Made an appointment and came in.

34:13.968 --> 34:18.556
John O'Connell was the other lawyer
and eventually became lead counsel.

34:20.516 --> 34:23.394
Initially, it just seemed
like a minor matter.

34:23.478 --> 34:25.063
Misdemeanor charges.

34:25.146 --> 34:29.442
Seemed to be just a big mistake
in a series of coincidences.

34:29.525 --> 34:32.236
Here's a guy
that was a college graduate.

34:32.320 --> 34:34.906
He was joining the LDS Church.

34:35.406 --> 34:38.951
My secretary at the time
was a young lady who had dated him.

34:39.035 --> 34:42.622
He seemed like, uh,
one of us, if you will.

34:44.040 --> 34:47.085
But shortly thereafter,
prosecutors got in touch with me

34:47.168 --> 34:49.837
and said, "We'd like you to come in
and talk to you about this guy."

34:50.588 --> 34:53.591
We think there may be more to this
than meets the eye.

34:54.175 --> 34:56.469
[female reporter]
Police found a brown gym bag in his car,

34:56.552 --> 35:01.390
containing a ski mask, an ice pick,
some strips of torn sheet.

35:01.891 --> 35:04.977
[Yocom] The items found in his vehicle
were very suspicious.

35:05.228 --> 35:08.523
There was a pry bar, pantyhose,
there were handcuffs.

35:08.940 --> 35:11.442
He also matched the description
of the individual

35:11.526 --> 35:13.903
that had attempted
to kidnap Carol DaRonch.

35:14.487 --> 35:18.032
So the investigation of Ted Bundy
began in earnest.

35:20.326 --> 35:23.454
The police called to say
they had a suspect

35:23.538 --> 35:25.957
and they want to know
if I could come down

35:26.040 --> 35:28.543
and look at him in a lineup.

35:29.377 --> 35:32.755
It was a relief to think
that they had caught someone.

35:34.006 --> 35:37.176
Ted called me unexpectedly at home

35:37.260 --> 35:39.846
and said that he was upset.

35:40.680 --> 35:43.766
He explained to me
that he had been arrested

35:43.850 --> 35:47.770
and that he was scheduled
the following day to be in a lineup.

35:48.980 --> 35:52.066
His demeanor at that time
was unlike him.

35:52.150 --> 35:55.653
He was usually so well ordered,
so... calm.

35:56.237 --> 35:59.365
But there was something
very upsetting in this to him.

35:59.448 --> 36:00.408
I could tell.

36:00.950 --> 36:03.995
That made me, uh, suspicious.

36:07.498 --> 36:09.959
[Yocom]
When Ted was brought in for a lineup,

36:10.042 --> 36:13.796
he had changed his appearance completely
from the few days before.

36:16.090 --> 36:20.761
He had his hair cut off and he changed
his part from one side to the other,

36:20.845 --> 36:22.471
and he made himself look
completely different.

36:24.390 --> 36:27.435
So we had to scramble
to get other people in the lineup

36:27.518 --> 36:29.270
to look like him at the time.

36:29.770 --> 36:33.441
It so happened the only people available
were law enforcement officers.

36:35.067 --> 36:38.321
[DaRonch] They brought me
into the police station and sat me down.

36:39.030 --> 36:41.866
And they had them walk out
and turn around and talk.

36:43.159 --> 36:45.244
And I recognized him immediately.

36:46.412 --> 36:51.292
The minute he walked in,
when I saw him walk, I knew it was him.

36:52.668 --> 36:55.755
[Bundy] People built a case
around a non-existent eyewitness.

36:55.838 --> 36:58.424
Eyewitness identification
was built by the police.

36:58.507 --> 36:59.508
But I kept it together,

36:59.592 --> 37:01.677
because there's no point
in destroying myself.

37:01.761 --> 37:05.389
I have got to keep myself together.
I've got to keep my presence of  mind.

37:05.473 --> 37:08.768
Because as long as I do that,
I am going to beat these people.

37:11.020 --> 37:13.022
[Lubeck] After those identifications,

37:13.105 --> 37:16.442
he was charged very quickly
with the kidnapping.

37:16.984 --> 37:20.821
And things changed from there,
as we got to know more.

37:23.783 --> 37:26.953
[Michaud] The front page
of the Seattle Post Intelligencer

37:27.036 --> 37:31.332
has a headline which reads,
"Is 'Utah Ted' the 'Seattle Ted?'"

37:31.874 --> 37:34.210
[McChesney]
From that moment on, we thought,

37:34.293 --> 37:38.965
"This might be the 'Ted'
that we were looking for."

37:39.757 --> 37:44.136
[reporter] Is Ted Bundy indeed a suspect
in your cases in King County?

37:45.137 --> 37:49.558
Well, it-- it's--
It's common knowledge that he is.

37:50.810 --> 37:54.063
[Michaud] That is when the states
start talking to one another.

37:55.273 --> 37:57.817
[male reporter]
Investigators from multiple Western states

37:57.900 --> 37:59.402
are convening in Aspen today

37:59.485 --> 38:01.779
to compare notes
on missing women cases

38:02.154 --> 38:05.324
that could be connected
to Theodore Robert Bundy.

38:05.408 --> 38:08.661
It's the first multi-state conference
of its kind.

38:09.161 --> 38:12.915
[Keppel] We were wondering
if what happened to the Colorado victim

38:12.999 --> 38:16.127
looks like what happened
to the Utah victim

38:16.210 --> 38:19.297
and looks like what happened
to the Washington State victim.

38:20.131 --> 38:23.259
[Yocom] There were
similar characteristics to the homicides.

38:23.342 --> 38:26.637
But at the time,
the kidnapping case of Carol DaRonch

38:26.721 --> 38:28.764
was the best case against Ted Bundy.

38:28.848 --> 38:33.102
The next step was to put the case
together and, uh, bring it to trial.

38:33.185 --> 38:37.273
The responsibility that was placed
on my shoulders is the lead prosecutor.

38:39.108 --> 38:42.028
[Preece] The reaction
of the people in our church branch

38:42.111 --> 38:45.614
that had known Ted
was one of incredulity.

38:45.906 --> 38:50.161
They just knew that he was innocent
of all charges.

38:50.244 --> 38:52.204
That was-- That was their feeling.

38:52.788 --> 38:55.708
Surely, this couldn't be true
of Ted Bundy.

38:57.126 --> 39:01.339
[Vortman] Ted called me up,
told me he was in jail in Utah.

39:01.422 --> 39:04.425
And I said, "Okay, I'll come down
and see you, hold your hand."

39:04.967 --> 39:07.511
I flew down to Salt Lake
and put myself up.

39:08.012 --> 39:10.056
[Preece] The branch members wondered,

39:10.139 --> 39:13.142
"What can we do to make people know
that he's not guilty?"

39:13.225 --> 39:15.519
And they flocked to his defense.

39:18.230 --> 39:22.068
[DaRonch] I remember
running into a woman in my subdivision,

39:22.151 --> 39:25.696
and she had said, you know, "Carol,
are you sure you have the right guy?"

39:26.155 --> 39:29.658
She was questioning me
just because he was a college student

39:29.742 --> 39:31.494
and... charming,

39:31.577 --> 39:33.913
good-looking, smart...

39:34.497 --> 39:36.082
and it was frustrating.

39:44.340 --> 39:47.051
[Lubeck]
We went to trial in February of '76.

39:47.968 --> 39:49.220
There was a lot of publicity.

39:50.429 --> 39:52.098
Ted wanted to be involved.

39:52.181 --> 39:55.810
He would look up cases
and come to us with ideas.

39:55.893 --> 39:58.813
He said, "I didn't do anything.
I'm not worried about it."

39:58.896 --> 40:01.982
It was pretty evident
that he relished the fight.

40:03.609 --> 40:07.822
Ted presented himself
as a clean-cut, boy-next-door type

40:07.905 --> 40:11.325
and he had a following in the courtroom
that gave him a lot of confidence.

40:11.659 --> 40:14.537
[reporter] You mentioned that it was, uh,
an education for the justice system.

40:14.620 --> 40:16.580
How do you feel
about the justice system in general

40:16.664 --> 40:17.832
based on your experience?

40:17.915 --> 40:20.459
Well, I'm sure it works
and you've gotta have faith it'll work

40:20.543 --> 40:23.504
or else you'd be reduced
to some kind of, uh...

40:23.587 --> 40:24.922
you know, mumbling idiot.

40:25.005 --> 40:27.383
Does that mean, uh, ultimately
you want to get involved

40:27.466 --> 40:29.927
-in the criminal justice system?
-Well... [chuckles]

40:30.010 --> 40:33.264
Um, a funny thing happened to me
on the way to labor law class one morning.

40:33.347 --> 40:36.183
I got two weeks in the spa
on the third floor up here.

40:36.559 --> 40:40.438
And, yes, I intend to complete
my legal education to become a lawyer

40:40.521 --> 40:42.356
and be a damn good lawyer.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.775
Uh, I think things are going to work out.

40:44.859 --> 40:46.277
That's about all I can say.

40:49.697 --> 40:53.826
[Yocom] Prior to the trial,
Ted had waived his right to a jury trial

40:53.909 --> 40:57.496
and decided to try the case
before Judge Hanson without a jury,

40:57.580 --> 41:01.417
so the judge would make the decision
on guilt or innocence alone

41:01.500 --> 41:02.585
without a jury there.

41:03.627 --> 41:05.629
[Lubeck]
We felt pretty good about the trial.

41:06.213 --> 41:07.923
Carol DaRonch was not strong.

41:08.507 --> 41:10.009
She wasn't real certain of herself.

41:11.177 --> 41:13.637
[DaRonch]
There were tons of people at the trial.

41:13.721 --> 41:17.933
I had never done anything
like that before and I was frightened.

41:18.476 --> 41:21.061
[man] Did he look different today
than as you remembered him to?

41:21.145 --> 41:23.314
He's looked different every time.
He's changed his appearance.

41:23.397 --> 41:24.523
[man] Different all the time?

41:25.357 --> 41:27.359
[DaRonch] I was on the stand for hours.

41:28.402 --> 41:32.156
They were always trying to confuse me
or trip me up...

41:33.032 --> 41:34.241
but I didn't care.

41:35.451 --> 41:37.745
[Bundy]
When Carol DaRonch came to testify,

41:37.828 --> 41:40.080
I was beside myself with rage.

41:40.164 --> 41:43.667
Uh, she is turning into a professional
witness as far as I'm concerned.

41:44.335 --> 41:47.296
I pointed at him and said,
"He was the one.

41:47.379 --> 41:50.174
He was the man that tried to kidnap me."

41:50.716 --> 41:52.551
[Bundy]
When I heard her go through that routine,

41:52.635 --> 41:54.803
I got very, very angry and indignant.

41:54.887 --> 41:57.765
And I got up and I pointed at the judge
and pointed at her

41:57.848 --> 42:01.101
and I said, "She's lying.
She's lied before, and she's lying now.

42:01.185 --> 42:03.521
[DaRonch]
I just thought he was really arrogant

42:03.604 --> 42:06.065
and always had a smirk on his face.

42:06.982 --> 42:09.109
[Bundy]
There is no right way for me to act.

42:09.193 --> 42:11.070
I showed emotion.
You know what people said?

42:11.153 --> 42:14.198
"See? He really can
get violent and angry."

42:14.281 --> 42:16.867
And I don't care
what people think about how I act.

42:16.951 --> 42:20.663
I act according to the way I think
is right and best for me at the time.

42:21.705 --> 42:24.500
I just think he thought
he was gonna get away with it.

42:26.502 --> 42:29.004
[male news anchor]
Theodore Robert Bundy, at age 25,

42:29.088 --> 42:31.340
a Republican campaign worker
in Seattle.

42:31.966 --> 42:34.468
At 28, a University of Utah law student.

42:35.052 --> 42:37.429
At 29, a convicted Utah kidnapper.

42:45.646 --> 42:47.982
[man] I just heard this afternoon that...

42:48.065 --> 42:50.776
the Salt Lake prosecutors
had obtained a conviction.

42:51.151 --> 42:52.444
And I just think they did

42:52.528 --> 42:54.572
a thoroughly professional,
outstanding job,

42:54.655 --> 42:57.616
and I congratulate them
on having succeeded.

42:59.076 --> 43:00.869
[Lubeck]
During the sentencing proceedings,

43:00.953 --> 43:04.290
Ted was eventually given
what is called a 90-day evaluation,

43:04.373 --> 43:07.084
where he went to the Utah State Prison
for an evaluation.

43:08.586 --> 43:12.631
[man] I was a psychologist
doing evaluations for the judge

43:12.715 --> 43:17.177
about whether he wants to send the person
to prison or be put on probation.

43:17.595 --> 43:20.180
The question was not whether or not
he committed the crime.

43:20.264 --> 43:21.890
He'd been found guilty.

43:21.974 --> 43:24.810
The question was
whether or not is he violent.

43:25.686 --> 43:29.940
There were so many people who said,
"He couldn't have done these things.

43:30.024 --> 43:32.610
He just doesn't have the personality."

43:32.693 --> 43:36.363
And so that's what was so fascinating--
It was a big mystery.

43:37.031 --> 43:38.365
And I like mysteries.

43:40.034 --> 43:42.119
My introduction to Ted:

43:42.202 --> 43:45.497
He walks toward me
with a smile on his face,

43:45.914 --> 43:47.207
looking very nice.

43:47.833 --> 43:49.710
You know, his clothes were pressed.

43:50.461 --> 43:51.337
And...

43:52.338 --> 43:54.798
he extended his hand and says,

43:55.341 --> 43:58.344
"Hi, I'm Ted Bundy.
You must be Dr. Carlisle."

43:59.178 --> 44:00.596
[Bundy] The psychologist--

44:00.679 --> 44:03.474
Well, he was an asshole,
but there must be, uh...

44:03.557 --> 44:06.852
some better words to describe
that kind of mentality.

44:06.935 --> 44:10.230
I-- I probably spoke to him more often

44:10.314 --> 44:12.775
during the time
I was at the Utah State Prison

44:12.858 --> 44:14.985
than any other prison official.

44:16.779 --> 44:19.782
[Carlisle] In essence, I says,
"Okay, Ted, to understand you.

44:19.865 --> 44:21.825
I wanna talk about your life."

44:23.619 --> 44:27.873
Bundy always painted
a very positive picture...

44:27.956 --> 44:31.001
of his mother, of his grandparents.

44:31.377 --> 44:34.129
[Bundy] Most of my close friends,
we played pee wee football.

44:34.213 --> 44:37.424
I later went out for the track team.
I did well in academics.

44:37.841 --> 44:41.095
Never had any trouble.
Not even a suggestion of trouble.

44:41.553 --> 44:44.723
I talked to the family.
They thought he was wonderful.

44:46.141 --> 44:49.103
[Mrs. Bundy] We still don't believe it.
It just-- just can't be.

44:49.186 --> 44:52.439
I keep shaking my head, saying,
"How can this be?"

44:52.523 --> 44:54.566
Because he had lots of friends,

44:55.234 --> 44:59.279
very good student in school,
was a very normal, active boy.

45:00.114 --> 45:02.449
[voice wavering]
Our son is the best son in the world.

45:03.367 --> 45:06.036
[Carlisle]
I talked to a few people in Salt Lake.

45:06.120 --> 45:08.872
I talked to some girlfriends.

45:09.665 --> 45:12.292
There were those who said,
"No, there's another side.

45:12.376 --> 45:13.669
There's a dark side of him."

45:15.129 --> 45:18.048
One girl told me
they went swimming together...

45:18.674 --> 45:22.720
and he pushes her head underwater
and holds it there.

45:23.929 --> 45:25.097
He lets her up,

45:25.514 --> 45:26.598
takes a breath,

45:26.682 --> 45:28.225
he pushes her down again.

45:30.102 --> 45:32.563
And she's thinking,
"He's trying to kill me."

45:35.065 --> 45:37.526
And I found out that there was this big...

45:38.152 --> 45:42.322
event that occurred, which I think
was really something powerful.

45:43.115 --> 45:45.367
When he was about 14 years old,

45:45.451 --> 45:49.288
in an old trunk,
he found his birth certificate

45:49.371 --> 45:52.082
and in the spot where it says, "father,"

45:53.167 --> 45:55.169
it said, "unknown."

45:57.421 --> 46:00.549
So that's how he found out
that he was illegitimate.

46:02.718 --> 46:04.887
[Michaud]
Ted's mother, Louise, became pregnant

46:04.970 --> 46:08.390
and had him in a home for unwed mothers.

46:08.474 --> 46:11.477
Then she left. She went home.

46:11.560 --> 46:13.479
She didn't intend to keep the child.

46:14.480 --> 46:17.566
But her father,
Ted's grandfather, insisted,

46:17.649 --> 46:20.611
"No, you go back and get that boy
and bring him home."

46:22.738 --> 46:26.241
[Carlisle] When I ask him about that,
he says, "Oh, that was no problem.

46:26.742 --> 46:28.452
That didn't bother me at all."

46:28.952 --> 46:31.955
[Bundy] This, of course,
this illegitimacy issue is...

46:32.414 --> 46:34.750
for the amateur psychologist
it's the thing.

46:34.833 --> 46:37.669
I mean, it's so stupid.
It just bugs the shit out of me.

46:37.753 --> 46:39.171
I don't know what to do about it.

46:39.880 --> 46:41.673
How many people are in fact--

46:41.757 --> 46:44.968
find out that they are illegitimate,
or even adopted, at a later age?

46:45.052 --> 46:46.094
It's normal.

46:47.304 --> 46:50.349
Denial, denial, denial, denial.

46:50.432 --> 46:52.601
To me, that was a big red flag.

46:53.352 --> 46:55.771
[Bundy]
The prison psychologist hoped so much

46:55.854 --> 46:58.273
that he himself would be responsible

46:58.357 --> 47:00.943
for opening Ted Bundy up
for the world to see...

47:01.026 --> 47:05.322
what was ticking inside
Bundy's obviously devious mind.

47:06.657 --> 47:10.661
[Michaud] It turns out that
Ted's grandfather had a violent streak.

47:11.370 --> 47:13.580
And there was ample reason to suspect

47:13.664 --> 47:16.416
that Ted suffered
some sort of abuse as a child,

47:16.500 --> 47:17.918
psychological or physical.

47:19.795 --> 47:22.589
[Carlisle] We were getting close
to the end of all this interviewing,

47:22.673 --> 47:25.425
and Ted and I were standing
outside the office.

47:25.509 --> 47:28.720
He says,
"Al, do you believe I killed those girls

47:28.804 --> 47:31.223
that they suspect me of in the Northwest?"

47:32.307 --> 47:34.726
And I hadn't mentioned them.

47:35.477 --> 47:37.855
And I paused for just a moment.

47:37.938 --> 47:39.481
What I said was,

47:39.565 --> 47:42.734
"Ted, I don't know, but I think
if you did, you'll do it again."

47:43.527 --> 47:45.904
He just looked at me for just a moment...

47:46.321 --> 47:49.992
and then he went back
down the corridor to his cell.

47:50.534 --> 47:53.036
And I submitted my report to the judge

47:53.120 --> 47:56.540
saying that it was my opinion

47:56.623 --> 47:59.793
that Ted had a violent side to him.

48:01.128 --> 48:04.172
Judge Hanson sentenced him
to the Utah State Prison for,

48:04.256 --> 48:07.634
under Utah law, what's called
an indeterminate term of one to 15 years.

48:11.138 --> 48:15.058
After he was sentenced to prison,
I stayed in touch with him quite closely,

48:15.142 --> 48:17.477
much, much more so than any other client.

48:18.270 --> 48:20.564
And I went to see him frequently
at the prison.

48:24.818 --> 48:27.237
[Bundy] I was in the visiting area
of maximum security

48:27.321 --> 48:29.948
at the Utah State Prison
with Bruce Lubeck.

48:30.032 --> 48:32.784
Bruce and I had been talking
for no more than 15 minutes

48:32.868 --> 48:36.163
when the steel doors
to security slid open.

48:36.747 --> 48:39.041
And into the room walked three men.

48:39.625 --> 48:42.586
They approached me and said,
"Mr. Bundy, we have here...

48:42.669 --> 48:46.965
the warrant for your arrest for the murder
of Caryn Campbell in Colorado.

48:50.677 --> 48:53.972
Bundy became an interest to Colorado
because of good detective work.

48:55.265 --> 48:57.976
There was circumstantial evidence
that put Bundy

48:58.060 --> 49:01.313
in the Wildwood Inn, in Snowmass.

49:02.606 --> 49:04.650
[Yocom]
We had found, through a search warrant,

49:04.733 --> 49:07.319
in Ted's apartment in Salt Lake,

49:07.653 --> 49:10.656
a brochure advertising the Wildwood Inn

49:10.739 --> 49:12.741
where Caryn Campbell was staying.

49:12.824 --> 49:15.452
We gave that over to Colorado.

49:16.036 --> 49:20.248
[Michaud] Then the police in Colorado
got Ted's gas slips,

49:20.332 --> 49:24.086
and they could place him
within a few miles of Caryn Campbell

49:24.169 --> 49:25.337
on the night she disappeared.

49:26.254 --> 49:30.092
[Yocom] A witness came forward
as seeing him in the elevator

49:30.175 --> 49:33.011
on the very day that Caryn was missing.

49:34.554 --> 49:38.350
[Leidner] He was, uh, charged
first-degree murder with premeditation,

49:38.684 --> 49:41.103
which would have carried,
at that time, the death penalty.

49:41.812 --> 49:46.149
Utah allowed him to be extradited back
to Colorado, which is very unusual.

49:46.483 --> 49:50.112
But the Colorado case involved a murder,
so it was more serious.

49:50.195 --> 49:53.031
[male news anchor] It was thought
Bundy would fight extradition,

49:53.115 --> 49:56.535
but this morning he told a Utah judge
he was ready to go to Colorado.

49:56.618 --> 49:58.453
[female reporter]
Why did Ted decide to wave extradition?

49:59.079 --> 50:01.707
Well, he is confident
that he can win in Colorado.

50:01.999 --> 50:04.626
He's confident that he can go
over there, stand trial, and win.

50:04.710 --> 50:05.877
And that's what he's gonna do.

50:08.839 --> 50:12.759
[Yocom] He was placed
in a jail in Aspen, awaiting trial there.

50:14.344 --> 50:15.679
[Lubeck] When he went to Colorado,

50:15.762 --> 50:19.224
we began to see a good deal of change
in Mr. Bundy, the way he...

50:19.516 --> 50:21.184
reacted to the legal system.

50:22.310 --> 50:24.771
I went over to visit him in county jail,

50:24.855 --> 50:27.524
which was a trip back in history.

50:28.900 --> 50:32.320
Down in the basement, low ceiling, bars--

50:32.404 --> 50:34.531
Just the classic old jail.

50:35.741 --> 50:38.618
Down there, he had gotten in a row
with one of the guards.

50:38.702 --> 50:41.788
A very innocuous comment
was made by the guard,

50:42.581 --> 50:44.958
but he got really, really angry.

50:45.042 --> 50:48.837
Red face, teeth bared, shaking...

50:50.213 --> 50:52.799
They were treating him
just like everyone else.

50:52.883 --> 50:56.762
Like he was nothing special
and he couldn't endure it.

50:58.263 --> 51:01.349
[Bundy] I don't like being locked up.
I don't like my liberty taken away,

51:01.433 --> 51:03.226
and I don't like
being treated like an animal,

51:03.310 --> 51:05.771
and I don't like
people walking around and ogling me

51:05.854 --> 51:08.899
like I'm some sort of weirdo,
because I'm not.

51:09.399 --> 51:11.193
Uh, being in prison...

51:11.943 --> 51:13.403
going through a kind of hell...

51:14.362 --> 51:18.617
matures a person, and I-- I think it's--
it's done good things for me.

51:20.952 --> 51:22.996
[Leidner]
He wasn't one of my favorite clients.

51:23.080 --> 51:25.040
He was very egocentric.

51:25.123 --> 51:26.333
When I would go to visit him,

51:26.416 --> 51:28.877
the only thing he would talk about
is himself.

51:29.211 --> 51:30.462
He wouldn't talk about the case.

51:30.545 --> 51:32.923
He wouldn't talk
about the cases in other states.

51:33.715 --> 51:36.343
The conversations were completely vapid

51:36.426 --> 51:38.595
and devoid of any content.

51:40.222 --> 51:43.642
Yeah, I know more about the--
My class is graduating in about a month.

51:44.851 --> 51:46.061
From law school.

51:46.144 --> 51:49.022
I'll bet you I know more about law
than any of them.

51:49.106 --> 51:51.066
[woman] How does it make you feel
that they are graduating?

51:51.149 --> 51:54.402
That pisses me off. [chuckles]
Now, that does piss me off.

51:56.029 --> 52:00.158
[female reporter] Bundy spends his life
inside this 16-cell county jail.

52:00.242 --> 52:02.327
He gets up at 6:30 in the morning,

52:02.410 --> 52:05.956
walks, he says,
about two miles a day, pacing his cell.

52:06.373 --> 52:09.709
But he spends most of his time
preparing his defense.

52:09.793 --> 52:12.629
First of all, I guess I should just ask
how are you doing up here.

52:13.547 --> 52:15.257
It's a-- It's a--

52:15.340 --> 52:17.843
short question
deserving a long answer. Uh...

52:18.176 --> 52:20.637
I'm doing well. I feel good. Uh...

52:21.012 --> 52:22.639
Working hard on my case.

52:23.390 --> 52:24.474
Uh...

52:24.558 --> 52:27.060
Need a lot more sun
and a lot more fresh air.

52:27.144 --> 52:28.562
But other than that, I'm doing okay.

52:28.645 --> 52:31.523
[woman] Do you get fresh air? Sun?
Do you get out at all?

52:31.606 --> 52:35.902
Well, I get to go to the library.
[chuckles] It's a 50-yard walk from here

52:35.986 --> 52:40.282
across the parking lot to the library.
That's my fresh air.

52:40.365 --> 52:42.868
[reporter] Ted, when you left Salt Lake,
when you were extradited,

52:42.951 --> 52:45.036
you issued a statement saying...

52:45.120 --> 52:46.454
you feel that...

52:47.038 --> 52:49.416
everything will turn out all right,
that you are innocent.

52:49.499 --> 52:50.500
Do you still feel that?

52:50.584 --> 52:52.878
You bet. Yeah, more than ever.

52:52.961 --> 52:55.463
I feel good about it,
and yes, I feel that I'm right,

52:55.547 --> 52:57.299
and yes, I feel I'm going to make it.

52:57.382 --> 52:58.717
No doubt in my mind.

53:00.760 --> 53:02.137
Gotta stick it up here more.

53:02.220 --> 53:04.514
Let me ask just a question here now, okay?

53:04.973 --> 53:06.308
You are not guilty?

53:07.350 --> 53:10.312
No, I'm not guilty. [laughs]

53:10.812 --> 53:14.774
Does that include the time I stole
a comic book when I was five years old?

53:14.858 --> 53:18.028
[chuckles] I am not guilty of the charges
which have been filed against me.

53:18.111 --> 53:19.571
And the allegations?

53:19.654 --> 53:22.073
-And the allegations.
-And the rumors, and--

53:22.157 --> 53:24.784
I don't know all of what
you're speaking about, Lucky.

53:24.868 --> 53:27.787
It's too broad, and I can't
get into it in any detail.

53:27.871 --> 53:29.039
Uh...

53:29.122 --> 53:31.708
But I'm satisfied with-- with my...

53:32.334 --> 53:34.377
blanket statement that I'm innocent.

53:34.794 --> 53:37.255
Uh, no man is truly innocent.

53:37.339 --> 53:40.967
I mean, we all transgressed
in some way in our lives.

53:41.051 --> 53:42.260
And as I say I...

53:43.136 --> 53:44.262
I've been, uh...

53:44.346 --> 53:47.974
impolite and other things
I regret having done in my life,

53:48.475 --> 53:50.227
uh, but...

53:50.810 --> 53:54.105
nothing like the things
I think that you're referring to.

53:54.981 --> 53:56.942
[female reporter] Have you ever
physically harmed anyone?

53:57.025 --> 53:58.818
"Ever physically harmed anyone"?

53:59.444 --> 54:00.445
No.

54:02.113 --> 54:03.031
No.

54:03.657 --> 54:05.283
You know, uh...

54:06.326 --> 54:09.829
Again, not in the context
I think that you're speaking of.

54:10.872 --> 54:12.499
You know? [inhales]

54:15.043 --> 54:17.545
[male reporter]
Do you think about getting out of here?

54:17.629 --> 54:19.130
Well... [chuckles]

54:19.214 --> 54:22.050
Well, legally, sure. [chuckles]

54:32.686 --> 54:35.480
[Bundy] As the months and weeks
wore on into spring,

54:35.563 --> 54:38.566
I think that one opportunity
after another passed,

54:38.650 --> 54:42.195
and I became more and more
impatient with myself.

54:44.864 --> 54:47.909
I psyched, psyched, psyched
myself up for weeks.

54:48.326 --> 54:50.161
And literally, it took-- it took weeks.

54:52.205 --> 54:58.962
I began jumping off the top bunk
in my cell in the Garfield County jail.

54:59.045 --> 55:02.507
Jumping again and again and again
off the top bunk to the floor

55:02.590 --> 55:04.592
to strengthen my legs for the impact.

55:06.594 --> 55:08.763
I measured,
mentally measured the distance

55:08.847 --> 55:10.849
from the corner of the courthouse
to the alley

55:10.932 --> 55:14.227
and from the alley to the riverbed
and from the riverbed to the mountains.

55:18.106 --> 55:21.067
And I measured my cell
and I ran those distances.

55:21.568 --> 55:23.903
I ran those distances again and again.

55:25.488 --> 55:28.408
I practiced how rapidly
I could change my clothes

55:28.491 --> 55:31.369
from my courtroom attire
to my shorts, and...

55:32.162 --> 55:34.414
I, uh, got a haircut...

55:35.123 --> 55:37.042
so that I had a different appearance.

55:39.044 --> 55:41.004
Finally I stood right before it.

55:41.880 --> 55:43.006
I hesitated.

55:43.089 --> 55:46.468
You cannot believe the thoughts
that flipped through my mind.

55:46.551 --> 55:47.635
I could be free.

55:48.053 --> 55:52.974
The windows were open and the fresh air
is blowing through and the sky was blue.

55:55.226 --> 55:56.770
And I said, "I'm ready to go,"

55:56.853 --> 55:58.855
and I walked to the window and jumped out.
[laughs]
