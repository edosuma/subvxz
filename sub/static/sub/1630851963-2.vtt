-We didn't find one that called
both Chambers and Fielding.

29:15.640 --> 29:18.960
But someone
called Chambers five times
since we found the Ragdoll.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.080
The same number

the Orfao case,

I don't have to tell you that.

anything anymore.

I was naive.

he was greedy.

31:30.880 --> 31:33.600
Freud renounced his own work
on female trauma,

31:33.640 --> 31:36.400
because the evidence
was telling him something
that he didn't want to believe.

31:36.440 --> 31:41.040
That rape starts at home,
that the patriarchal family
is not a safe space.

31:41.080 --> 31:43.800
And we won't fix
our mental health crisis
until we confront

31:43.840 --> 31:46.120
the foundational lie
of the police force.

31:46.160 --> 31:48.600
-Which is?
-That having
a monopoly on violence

31:48.640 --> 31:50.360

a monopoly on the truth.

-Because of your mental health.

32:02.280 --> 32:05.200
It's not a secret. We can
learn from your experience.

32:05.240 --> 32:09.280
Why do police officers find it
impossible to admit
that we suffer?

32:09.320 --> 32:12.160
Because I need to look victims
and their families in the eye.

32:12.200 --> 32:14.800
And I can't do that
if I'm also saying,
"What about me?"

32:14.840 --> 32:16.680
But what about you?

32:16.720 --> 32:19.520
Your state of mind
can change the facts of a case.

32:19.560 --> 32:22.800
Literally. When you
observe something, you change it
and you're changed, too.

32:22.840 --> 32:24.560
That's Physics,
that's how the universe works.

32:24.600 --> 32:27.560
Right. And when two atoms react,
they create
one six-dimensional object

32:27.600 --> 32:29.880
in two space-time continuums.

32:29.920 --> 32:31.920

into infinite worlds.
