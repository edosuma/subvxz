02:10.930 --> 02:12.932
Thanks, honey. Couldn't
have done it without you.

02:12.967 --> 02:14.899
You always know how
to time a dramatic entrance.

02:14.934 --> 02:16.936
Well,
it actually looked like
you were having fun until

02:16.971 --> 02:18.138
those last two
goons jumped on you.

02:18.538 --> 02:19.704
Well,
i've been paying attention.

02:19.739 --> 02:21.741
Oh, this is so
gonna piss eckhart off.

02:21.776 --> 02:22.907
I know.

02:22.942 --> 02:24.143
So what'd you get?

02:24.178 --> 02:25.362
I got the best shoes.

02:25.397 --> 02:26.546
Sixty percent off.

02:26.581 --> 02:27.747
Nice.

03:33.479 --> 03:35.081
Tore the place apart and
took three people hostage.

03:36.282 --> 03:38.685
They got,
but eight escaped through
another secured safehouse.

03:38.720 --> 03:40.687
We can be grateful
for that much.

03:41.087 --> 03:43.489
Yeah, but let's not
dismiss the three the gsa took

03:43.890 --> 03:45.456
as faceless statistics.

03:45.491 --> 03:47.058
That's not what
i'm saying, adam.

03:47.093 --> 03:50.697
It's... you know,
jenny stackel was one of
the ones that got nailed.

03:50.732 --> 03:52.664
All right, well, jenny's
a good friend of ours.

03:52.699 --> 03:55.702
Jenny helped a lot of
people get into the underground.

03:55.737 --> 03:58.705
I'd say the
failsafe self-destruct
cut in just in time.

04:04.310 --> 04:05.877
Coulda warned me first.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.914
Ah, just keeping
you on your toes.

04:08.314 --> 04:10.316
Any idea why the gsa is
suddenly so successful

04:10.717 --> 04:12.283
at finding
our safehouses?

04:12.318 --> 04:14.721
Well, right now,
i don't have a clue.

04:28.735 --> 04:31.537
Well, they destroyed
the security camera.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.139
The disk seems fine.

04:33.539 --> 04:35.541
Good.

04:35.942 --> 04:38.309
Then we'll get an entire
replay of the break in.

04:38.344 --> 04:40.747
All right, guys, we need
to take a hard look at safehouse

04:40.782 --> 04:42.348
security across the board.

04:42.383 --> 04:44.315
Yeah, absolutely.

04:44.350 --> 04:45.516
We gotta do
something - and fast

04:45.551 --> 04:47.954
- or our credibility
in the underground is shot.

04:52.759 --> 04:57.964
I suppose i would have to say my
glass is half empty, mr. Delay.

04:58.364 --> 05:01.967
Four armed gsagents
versus two unarmed women.

05:02.002 --> 05:05.571
And it's the gsagents
who end up in a pile.

05:11.978 --> 05:15.146
On the other hand, i will grant
you the wonderful successes

05:15.181 --> 05:20.386
you've had in
shutting down these so-called
safehouses of adam's.

05:20.421 --> 05:21.953
Thank you, sir.

05:21.988 --> 05:25.391
It would appear our little
secret weapon is working.

05:25.426 --> 05:28.795
Now, if only we could
develop a means to countermand

05:28.830 --> 05:31.562
the self-destruct devices.

05:31.597 --> 05:33.799
We're working
on it, mr. Eckhart.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.967
As for the debacle
at the skywalk,

05:36.002 --> 05:38.004
i've already begun disciplinary
action on the quartet.

05:38.039 --> 05:39.971
Good.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.008
All four gsagents will
lose rank and privilege

05:42.043 --> 05:43.975
and undergo
extensive retraining.

05:44.010 --> 05:47.213
Well, i don't
think that will even begin
to solve the problem, sir.

05:47.248 --> 05:49.215
Miss bigelow,
i don't recall inviting
you to this meeting.

05:49.615 --> 05:52.018
The first thing gsagent
trainees are taught
is to take initiative...

05:52.053 --> 05:53.184
sir.

05:53.219 --> 05:55.186
Well, if it isn't
our new secret weapon.

05:55.221 --> 05:59.225
Come in, miss bigelow, and share
your feelings about the way

05:59.625 --> 06:01.993
we do things here at the gsa.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.030
The problem with the
current crop of gsagents

06:04.430 --> 06:06.032
isn't their
training, mr. Eckhart.

06:06.067 --> 06:07.633
It's their trainer.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.200
Excuse me?

06:09.235 --> 06:13.639
Are you saying that
mr. Delay is at fault?

06:13.674 --> 06:15.206
Well, i'm afraid so, sir.

06:15.241 --> 06:17.208
I accompanied mr. Delay
on the safehouse raid.

06:17.243 --> 06:20.847
The squad
demonstrated the same
lack of team effort that

06:20.882 --> 06:23.249
resulted in the embarrassment
with the two women.

06:23.649 --> 06:28.054
Your telecyber abilities
make you a promising
recruit, miss bigelow.

06:28.089 --> 06:29.620
Well, thank you, sir.

06:29.655 --> 06:32.058
And, if i
may say so, i would love
to have the opportunity

06:32.093 --> 06:33.659
to fulfil that promise.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.861
Sooner,
rather than later.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.780
What exactly are your...

06:37.815 --> 06:39.630
ultimate professional goals?

06:39.665 --> 06:42.468
Ultimately, i would like
to have your job, sir.

06:42.503 --> 06:46.437
<laughing>
and precisely.

06:46.472 --> 06:50.877
How will you plan your career
trajectory to get my job?

06:50.912 --> 06:52.478
By taking his job.

06:52.879 --> 06:54.045
Now just
one damn minute...

06:54.080 --> 06:58.084
mr. Delay is
one of my most capable
and trustworthy agents.

06:58.119 --> 07:00.504
Why should i transfer
that trust to you?

07:00.539 --> 07:02.889
Well, right now,
you shouldn't, sir.

07:03.289 --> 07:06.092
Given the opportunity,
my actions will speak for me.

07:13.299 --> 07:15.701
So i checked out the security
videos from the safehouse.

07:15.736 --> 07:16.868
Yeah?

07:16.903 --> 07:18.469
And besides our friends
getting arrested for being

07:18.504 --> 07:20.506
different, there's really
nothing we don't already know.

07:20.541 --> 07:23.309
You think we have a
mole in the underground?

07:23.709 --> 07:26.512
Well,
anything's possible, but
my instincts are telling me

07:26.547 --> 07:28.514
they're working us
over from the outside.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.081
Your instincts.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.518
Yeah, come on
- i spent enough time
on the wrong side.

07:32.553 --> 07:35.321
I can smell
a rat a mile away.

07:35.356 --> 07:37.688
Michelle?

07:37.723 --> 07:39.325
What are
you looking at?

07:39.725 --> 07:41.527
That security video.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.329
Come and check this out.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.700
Okay,
so who's michelle?

07:49.735 --> 07:51.737
That's her, the
one on the right.

07:51.772 --> 07:54.105
What? You knew her?

07:54.140 --> 07:56.507
Yeah, we went to
high school together.

07:56.542 --> 07:58.944
What? You got a high
school bud working at the gsa?

07:58.979 --> 08:01.347
We were pretty tight from
freshman to senior year,

08:01.382 --> 08:03.749
but we lost touch
after graduation.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.953
She's a
new mutant, too.

08:15.361 --> 08:17.363
We gotta do a complete sweep
of all the safehouses that

08:17.398 --> 08:19.365
remain uncompromised so we
can figure out where the breach

08:19.400 --> 08:21.367
is and how to close it.

08:21.767 --> 08:23.734
All right.

08:23.769 --> 08:26.172
Well, i've already
put together a plan
based on what you told me.

08:26.207 --> 08:27.773
But, i gotta be honest with
you, adam, i don't think the

08:28.174 --> 08:29.375
problem's with the
people we're letting
into the safehouses.

08:29.410 --> 08:30.942
Well,
i tend to agree.

08:30.977 --> 08:33.744
Let's see how we feel after
we debrief the aide who escaped.

08:33.779 --> 08:36.982
Now, emma tells me
that the gsa have a telecyber
psionic on their payroll.

08:37.018 --> 08:38.950
A what?

08:38.985 --> 08:41.988
Well, i've done
some limited experiments
splicing dna stands with

08:42.023 --> 08:44.991
what ultimately
became the post-silicon-based
computer technology?

08:45.026 --> 08:46.557
Yeah.
I've heard of that.

08:46.592 --> 08:48.594
Kind of living organic
computers, right?

08:48.629 --> 08:50.161
Well,
that's stretching a little.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.999
But these
telecybers can mentally
interact with computers.

08:53.034 --> 08:55.366
You know,
but a lot of it,

08:55.401 --> 08:57.403
i just don't know much
about it. It's still a mystery.

08:57.803 --> 09:00.206
Well, could that
be how the gsa's busting
into our safehouses?

09:00.241 --> 09:01.007
Yeah.

09:01.407 --> 09:02.573
That's within the
realm of possibility.

09:02.608 --> 09:03.809
We gotta find out
some data on this telecyber

09:04.210 --> 09:05.411
- as soon as possible.

09:05.446 --> 09:06.612
Okay.

09:49.055 --> 09:49.820
Hey, guys.

09:49.855 --> 09:51.057
I went to go meet
up with an old friend.

09:51.092 --> 09:52.658
Be back in an hour.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.280
You made me look like an
idiot today, miss bigelow.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.682
You don't want
me for an enemy.

10:17.083 --> 10:19.685
I don't want you
for a friend, either.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.253
I simply stated
things as i saw them.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.890
And now it's
up to mr. Eckhart to
decide how to proceed.

10:24.925 --> 10:28.011
It's up to
you to do your job and
keep your mouth shut.

10:28.046 --> 10:31.097
Nobody gives a damn about
your insipid little opinions.

10:31.132 --> 10:34.300
Well, mr. Eckhart
seemed pretty fascinated.

10:34.700 --> 10:37.903
Mr. Eckhart may have
a great deal of confidence

10:38.304 --> 10:39.505
in you and your abilities...

10:39.905 --> 10:41.872
for good reason.

10:41.907 --> 10:45.476
...but i don't share
his enthusiasm.

10:45.511 --> 10:50.716
A word of advice,
miss bigelow: Watch your back.

10:51.117 --> 10:53.919
When i want your advice,
i'll beat it out of you.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.088
Now, unless you want me to tell

10:57.123 --> 10:59.525
mr. Eckhart just how your
ineptitude let those other eight

10:59.560 --> 11:01.527
anomalies slip
out of your hands,

11:01.927 --> 11:04.330
i suggest you let
me do my evening's work.

12:42.828 --> 12:45.631
So, this telecyber
with the gsa went to
high school with emma, huh?

12:45.666 --> 12:46.832
Yeah.

12:47.233 --> 12:48.834
Could you
imagine connected to a
computer with your mind?

12:48.869 --> 12:51.237
Well,
anything that'd do away
with the carpal tunnel

12:51.272 --> 12:53.239
syndrome's okay with me.

13:03.249 --> 13:05.216
Can you
believe this guy?

13:05.251 --> 13:06.452
You want to
take him, or shall i?

13:06.852 --> 13:08.654
Ah, go ahead.

13:08.689 --> 13:10.456
<laughing>

13:29.275 --> 13:30.876
thought you had him.

14:50.956 --> 14:53.359
I hate the simulations.

14:53.759 --> 14:54.925
Hey, you know what?

14:54.960 --> 14:56.962
The first one of you
to laugh gets a jump start.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.964
Nothing funny
about that, brennan.

14:59.365 --> 15:01.367
It's nothing funny about
a sudden surprise attack from

15:01.767 --> 15:03.334
hostile forces, either.

15:03.369 --> 15:05.371
You could've
at least warned us that
it wasn't going to be

15:05.406 --> 15:07.373
the usual hostile
forces attack, adam.

15:07.773 --> 15:08.574
Yeah,
i mean, come on...

15:08.609 --> 15:09.740
wha... wha...

15:09.775 --> 15:10.941
popping in and out like that?

15:10.976 --> 15:12.177
And then it
wouldn't be a surprise

15:12.212 --> 15:13.779
- or sudden
- now, would it?

15:20.185 --> 15:21.787
It only looks like i'm alone.

15:21.822 --> 15:23.789
I'm waiting for someone.

15:23.824 --> 15:25.391
Okay.

15:49.014 --> 15:50.816
Emma.

15:50.851 --> 15:52.583
Emma.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.184
You're late.

15:54.219 --> 15:55.786
Just like always.

15:55.821 --> 15:57.623
And you are taking a
really big risk here, emma.

15:57.658 --> 15:59.425
Come on, you never ratted
me out in high school.

15:59.825 --> 16:01.026
Yeah, well, this
isn't high school.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.593
Fine.

16:02.628 --> 16:05.030
Regardless of what sides we're
on, we're still friends, right?

16:05.065 --> 16:08.233
I guess.

16:08.634 --> 16:10.200
You guess?

16:10.235 --> 16:12.202
You're forgetting
something here, michelle.

16:12.237 --> 16:15.441
Before either of us knew
about new mutants or genomex or

16:15.476 --> 16:18.243
mutant x, we both
knew that we were different.

16:19.845 --> 16:21.847
And we were really lucky to have
each other to share our secret.

16:21.882 --> 16:24.650
So, what do you say
you meet me at jaspers?

16:24.685 --> 16:26.617
Oh, i don't know.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.654
We're on different
sides of the fence now.

16:28.689 --> 16:30.656
Come on, michelle,
fences are for climbing.

16:31.056 --> 16:33.058
This is you and
me we're talking about.

16:33.093 --> 16:35.461
Okay.

16:35.861 --> 16:39.464
I can spend an hour and
then i have to get back.

16:39.499 --> 16:43.068
Okay, is that an hour in
real time or bigelow time?

16:43.103 --> 16:47.072
I'll see you in fifteen
minutes - real time.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.702
The only thing these training
exercises are preparing us for

17:16.737 --> 17:18.704
is to fight simulations, and
i don't care how many millions

17:18.739 --> 17:20.305
of scenarios the
computer comes up with,

17:20.705 --> 17:22.307
they're still just holograms.

17:22.342 --> 17:23.909
They're not holograms.

17:23.944 --> 17:24.710
They're tactile.

17:25.109 --> 17:26.712
And i programmed them
all to have free will.

17:26.747 --> 17:29.079
I mean, see, but you...

17:29.114 --> 17:32.317
you're just
annoyed because the computer
outfought you both, right?

17:32.352 --> 17:34.720
The only reason you don't
like virtual simulations is

17:34.755 --> 17:36.321
because you haven't
beaten one yet.

17:36.356 --> 17:37.087
Aw, it's not true.

17:37.122 --> 17:38.323
We've beaten
them lots of times.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.325
Yeah, well,
only when you knew what
exactly what to expect.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.327
But the minute you have a
virtual opponent who zigs,

17:42.728 --> 17:45.130
you know, boom, pow,
and you expect it to zag,

17:45.165 --> 17:46.732
well, then,
it's home for a loss.

17:47.132 --> 17:48.699
I bet you had
trouble with, uh,

17:48.734 --> 17:51.136
video games when you
were a kid, right?

17:51.171 --> 17:53.939
Still do.

17:59.545 --> 18:02.312
<laughing> oh, god.

18:02.347 --> 18:08.754
So, um, do your friends
know you're here?

18:08.789 --> 18:11.522
Not any more.

18:11.557 --> 18:13.959
Gotta admit it,
though, it is so weird
to be here again.

18:13.994 --> 18:15.526
I know.

18:15.561 --> 18:18.764
Can you believe that same
guy still works at the counter?

18:18.799 --> 18:19.965
I know.

18:20.365 --> 18:23.969
We made his life a
living hell, didn't we?

18:24.004 --> 18:27.573
So you want
me to do it, or what?

18:27.973 --> 18:29.975
Well, do what?

18:34.379 --> 18:35.981
Thanks.

18:36.016 --> 18:37.583
Excuse me?

18:42.788 --> 18:43.989
Two double lattes.

18:44.389 --> 18:45.991
Just like you ordered.

18:46.391 --> 18:48.794
You did order them, didn't you?

18:48.829 --> 18:51.414
Oh, that is so sweet.

18:51.449 --> 18:53.999
Thank you so much.

18:59.204 --> 19:01.206
And then, when we were ready
to skip out of this place...

19:01.241 --> 19:02.808
i'd say the magic phrase.

19:03.208 --> 19:04.810
I'm over this place.

19:04.845 --> 19:06.411
And then?

19:10.816 --> 19:11.617
Oops.

19:12.017 --> 19:13.218
No power.

19:15.220 --> 19:17.222
And then we'd skip out the
back without paying the check.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.388
Oh, my gosh.

19:18.423 --> 19:19.625
We were terrible.

19:20.025 --> 19:21.226
We're still terrible.

19:21.627 --> 19:24.029
And sometimes,
we were the only
ones who could keep

19:24.064 --> 19:25.596
the other one sane.

19:25.631 --> 19:27.633
Yeah,
i couldn't believe it
when i saw you on...

19:27.668 --> 19:30.035
your security video.

19:30.070 --> 19:32.402
Yeah.

19:32.437 --> 19:36.041
I gotta say,
it's now how i pictured
running into you again.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.449
So how long
you been with the gsa?

19:44.850 --> 19:46.416
A little under a year.

19:46.451 --> 19:48.018
You know,
i'm surprised, michelle.

19:48.053 --> 19:51.056
In school, you always had
such high goals for yourself.

19:51.091 --> 19:54.059
And now,
thanks to mr. Eckhart,
i'm achieving those goals.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.874
So adam seems
to think jesse's problem
is that he got his

20:08.909 --> 20:10.475
butt kicked by
the training simulation.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.477
What do you think?

20:17.683 --> 20:19.284
Got an
opinion there, buster?

20:19.319 --> 20:21.286
Or am i bothering you?

20:21.687 --> 20:22.888
No.

20:24.089 --> 20:26.491
But, just for
the record, i'm reading
a gsa training manual

20:26.892 --> 20:28.693
file that
i swiped last time
we paid them a visit.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.495
I'm trying
to find a clue as to
how they're bypassing

20:30.896 --> 20:32.462
our security system.

20:32.497 --> 20:34.464
As for the training
simulations,

20:34.499 --> 20:37.302
i think jesse's just taking
it way too seriously.

20:37.337 --> 20:38.468
That's funny.

20:38.503 --> 20:40.070
I always enjoy them.

20:40.105 --> 20:42.507
Yeah,
you just like anything that
gets you up and moving.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.910
Even if there's a little
virtual ass-kicking involved,

20:44.945 --> 20:46.476
all the better.

20:46.511 --> 20:48.914
Anything we
can use in there?

20:48.949 --> 20:51.281
Nah, not really.

20:51.316 --> 20:54.519
Well, other than the fact
that eckhart considers you

20:54.920 --> 20:56.887
- and this is a quote

20:56.922 --> 20:58.889
- "shalimar
fox is, by far,

20:58.924 --> 21:02.527
the least interesting
member of mutant x. "

21:02.562 --> 21:04.494
What?

21:04.529 --> 21:06.932
Give me that.

21:10.135 --> 21:12.537
Made you look.

21:12.572 --> 21:14.940
You idiot.

21:14.975 --> 21:16.541
Ow.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.946
The gsa
is a law enforcement
organization, emma.

21:21.346 --> 21:23.749
His mission is
to protect new mutants
from themselves.

21:23.784 --> 21:24.950
Oh, please.

21:25.350 --> 21:27.352
Just because you work for
the so-called law does not make

21:27.387 --> 21:29.720
the gsa moral,
ethical or right.

21:29.755 --> 21:32.157
I think it's time
you realised what
you're a part of.

21:32.557 --> 21:35.761
Mutant x is a pack
of outlaws who flaunt
their illegal behaviour.

21:35.796 --> 21:37.327
No. No.
We do not break the law.

21:37.362 --> 21:39.730
Well,
you're out there wreaking
havoc when you should be

21:39.765 --> 21:42.968
working within the
system to make the world
ready for new mutants.

21:43.003 --> 21:45.370
And you honestly believe that
that's what you're doing?

21:45.771 --> 21:47.337
Absolutely.

21:47.372 --> 21:49.374
You think you're some kind
of a romantic hero, running

21:49.409 --> 21:51.376
around with adam and
the rest - forget about it.

21:51.777 --> 21:54.179
You're nothing
more than a bunch of
common criminals using

21:54.214 --> 21:56.982
your
heightened abilities
for your own benefit.

21:57.017 --> 21:59.384
<laughing> you
are out of your mind.

21:59.419 --> 22:00.951
Adam is a man with a mission.

22:00.986 --> 22:04.589
To prepare the world for our
existence, one step at a time.

22:04.624 --> 22:05.390
Uh huh.

22:05.791 --> 22:07.392
And it's adam's mission
that caused new mutants

22:07.427 --> 22:08.593
grief in
the first place.

22:08.628 --> 22:10.160
Oh, is that so?

22:10.195 --> 22:13.198
Well, how do feel about choosing
to wear a subdermal governor?

22:13.233 --> 22:15.918
How do you think
the world would feel
if it knew there were

22:15.953 --> 22:18.603
people like us
among them, with powers
and abilities that

22:18.638 --> 22:20.570
dwarf the imagination?

22:20.605 --> 22:23.208
You're starting to sound
like a recruitment poster.

22:23.243 --> 22:25.811
Look, we're both psionics
and we both know just how

22:25.846 --> 22:29.014
crazy we can get,
thanks to our abilities.

22:29.049 --> 22:32.217
The gsa has
saved my sanity.

22:32.617 --> 22:36.186
Maybe my life.

22:36.221 --> 22:38.223
I know you, michelle.

22:38.623 --> 22:40.991
And i believe that
you think that's true.

22:41.026 --> 22:45.430
But i'm telling you,
eckhart does not have any
plan for assimilation.

22:45.831 --> 22:49.434
You know, if adam hadn't
rescued me, i would be stuck

22:49.469 --> 22:53.038
tracking down new mutants
to put into stasis pods

22:53.073 --> 22:55.405
for future observation.

22:55.440 --> 22:57.442
You know, this sounds
just like the arguments

22:57.477 --> 22:59.444
we'd have back
in freshman year.

22:59.479 --> 23:01.011
I respected authority...

23:01.046 --> 23:03.448
and i questioned
it every chance i got.

23:03.483 --> 23:05.851
But you were always
open to new ideas.

23:06.251 --> 23:08.653
You know, be...

23:09.054 --> 23:10.655
be open to the fact that
maybe the gsa isn't everything

23:11.056 --> 23:12.657
you think it is.

23:12.692 --> 23:13.859
Fine.

23:14.259 --> 23:17.863
If you do the
same for mutant x.

23:17.898 --> 23:21.466
Sure.

23:25.871 --> 23:28.238
You don't mean it, do you?

23:28.273 --> 23:31.076
You could always read me
like a book, couldn't you?

23:45.891 --> 23:48.693
Nicely done, miss bigelow.

23:49.094 --> 23:50.695
If you don't
come along quietly,

23:50.730 --> 23:52.297
i can't vouch
for anyone's safety.

23:52.697 --> 23:54.699
So i guess this is one
of those goals eckhart's

23:54.734 --> 23:56.301
helping you achieve, huh?

24:00.305 --> 24:02.707
Look, it's not video
games or simulations.

24:02.742 --> 24:03.909
It's tests.

24:04.309 --> 24:06.276
I was a pretty
good student in school,

24:06.311 --> 24:09.114
but no matter
how hard i worked
or how prepared i was,

24:09.149 --> 24:11.534
i still always
froze on finals.

24:11.569 --> 24:13.919
I know exactly
how you feel.

24:13.954 --> 24:15.120
Yeah, right.

24:15.520 --> 24:16.686
No, i'm serious.

24:16.721 --> 24:18.523
You know, i may have been
to college at the age of twelve,

24:18.558 --> 24:20.325
but it doesn't mean i didn't
have a hard time taking tests.

24:20.360 --> 24:21.927
I'm sorry.

24:22.327 --> 24:23.929
I'm just having a hard
time visualising you having

24:23.964 --> 24:25.530
a hard time doing anything.

24:25.565 --> 24:26.696
<laughing> what?

24:26.731 --> 24:27.933
You think this
all just comes to me?

24:28.333 --> 24:29.134
I mean, when...

24:29.534 --> 24:31.136
when you use your
abilities, when you, uh...

24:31.171 --> 24:32.337
when you phase
out, or you mass, it...

24:32.737 --> 24:33.939
it takes a concerted
effort, right?

24:33.974 --> 24:35.505
Shalimar wears herself out...

24:35.540 --> 24:37.942
and emma gets occasional
migraines and brennan's coil

24:37.977 --> 24:40.310
doesn't just happen,
he has to work at it, right?

24:40.345 --> 24:41.947
So, for all of us, it takes a
lot of work, a lot of effort,

24:41.982 --> 24:43.513
a lot of concentration.

24:43.548 --> 24:45.951
So why is it, that, when i'm
fighting the real gsagents,

24:45.986 --> 24:47.953
it doesn't feel like i
gotta work as hard as when

24:47.988 --> 24:49.519
i'm fighting
the virtual gsagents?

24:49.554 --> 24:51.956
Because,
when it's real life,
you react instinctually.

24:51.991 --> 24:54.324
So maybe what you have to
do is you have to create the

24:54.359 --> 24:56.761
mindset where
you treat the simulations
like they're real life.

24:56.796 --> 24:59.164
When it's a real
thing, i just kind of
switch on to automatic.

24:59.564 --> 25:01.566
I let my instincts
take over.

25:01.967 --> 25:02.767
That's right.

25:03.168 --> 25:04.769
Endorphins are pumping,
the adrenaline rush.

25:04.804 --> 25:05.535
You know?

25:05.570 --> 25:07.172
Everything's at stake.

25:07.207 --> 25:08.338
I guess.

25:08.373 --> 25:10.775
Still can't see you
crammin' for a final, though.

25:11.176 --> 25:14.379
Who said i had to cram?

25:14.414 --> 25:16.198
So where's emma?

25:16.233 --> 25:17.983
I don't know.

25:18.383 --> 25:19.549
<recording> hey, guys.

25:19.584 --> 25:20.785
Went to meet
up with an old friend.

25:20.820 --> 25:22.387
Be back in an hour.

25:22.787 --> 25:25.190
That was three hours ago.

25:25.225 --> 25:25.991
That's not like her.

25:26.026 --> 25:26.756
Huh.

25:26.791 --> 25:30.795
Old friend
i can think of is michelle... nly

25:30.830 --> 25:34.799
and since michelle's
a trainee for the gsa...

25:36.001 --> 25:38.003
emma?

25:38.403 --> 25:40.005
Emma.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.575
Emma.

25:45.610 --> 25:48.413
Her ring's
been deactivated.

26:00.392 --> 26:03.194
You can be as high and mighty
about the lofty goals of

26:03.229 --> 26:04.761
genomex as you like.

26:04.796 --> 26:07.599
At least we don't go around
slapping governors on other new

26:07.634 --> 26:10.001
mutants, or throwing
them into statis pods.

26:10.036 --> 26:11.568
We have a federal mandate.

26:11.603 --> 26:14.005
You know, the worst part is,
when we were at jasper's,

26:14.040 --> 26:16.408
i actually began to
question the gsa's motives

26:16.443 --> 26:17.974
in the greater
scheme of things.

26:18.009 --> 26:19.611
Is that before
or after you set me up?

26:19.646 --> 26:21.212
We both have our missions.

26:21.247 --> 26:22.779
Come on, michelle.

26:22.814 --> 26:24.416
Take a look
at this place.

26:24.816 --> 26:26.818
It's nothing more than a
prison for people like us.

26:26.853 --> 26:28.019
Save it, emma.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.822
Your credibility and
our friendship are gone.

26:38.430 --> 26:39.996
Well, let's not
be too hard on emma.

26:40.031 --> 26:42.434
All of us have been guilty of
letting our feelings for old

26:42.469 --> 26:44.436
friends blind us as
to who they've become.

26:47.238 --> 26:48.840
Oh, come on, adam,
she's a gsa trainee.

26:48.875 --> 26:50.442
It's like walking
into a lion's den.

26:50.842 --> 26:52.409
Excuse me.

26:52.444 --> 26:55.246
Last i looked,
you'd been ambushed
by old friends yourself.

26:55.647 --> 26:56.848
Okay.

26:57.248 --> 27:00.417
Point made and taken.

27:00.452 --> 27:03.254
Okay, adam, we're ready
to go in and grab emma.

27:03.289 --> 27:04.456
Yeah. But wait.

27:04.856 --> 27:06.423
Before you just bust
in, overfly genomex.

27:06.458 --> 27:09.260
Use the onboard sensors to
determine if they're still

27:09.295 --> 27:11.663
holding her and, if so, where.

27:12.063 --> 27:13.630
Got it.

27:13.665 --> 27:15.266
So what do we know about
this friend of hers anyway?

27:15.667 --> 27:18.069
Well,
according to my data, her
dna might be going through

27:18.104 --> 27:19.688
a radical evolution.

27:19.723 --> 27:21.272
What kind of evolution?

27:21.307 --> 27:22.839
Emotional.

27:22.874 --> 27:26.878
Telecybers are prone to
radical emotional shifts.

27:27.278 --> 27:28.445
Right, adam.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.081
We're on our way.

27:33.685 --> 27:34.886
You know what's really scary
about eckhart is that he's

27:35.286 --> 27:37.288
convinced
he's doing the right thing
by terrorising new mutants.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.107
I said we weren't going
to talk about this any more.

27:39.142 --> 27:40.892
You're willing to give
your entire life over to an

27:41.292 --> 27:43.259
assumption based on what
someone else has told you?

27:43.294 --> 27:46.898
I have just as much
faith in mr. Eckhart's cause
as you seem to in adam.

27:46.933 --> 27:48.465
Faith is for god.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.101
What you're talking
about is denial.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.469
Then why should
i take you at your
word about any of this?

27:52.504 --> 27:53.705
I have no emotional
problems, because
i have no emotions at all.

27:53.740 --> 27:56.107
There's plenty of evidence
to confirm everything i've said.

27:56.142 --> 27:58.074
What's that
supposed to mean?

27:58.109 --> 28:00.111
You want to prove eckhart's
intentions are noble,

28:00.146 --> 28:01.678
then do it.

28:01.713 --> 28:03.715
Use your abilities to give
us both a look at what's

28:03.750 --> 28:05.316
in those computers up there.

28:05.717 --> 28:08.119
Once you do, you'll know
that i'm not lying to you.

28:08.154 --> 28:11.688
And that i am
still your friend.

28:11.723 --> 28:14.125
Consider this you finally
paying me back for taking that

28:14.160 --> 28:16.092
english final for you.

28:16.127 --> 28:17.694
What?
You bring that up now?

28:17.729 --> 28:19.731
I'll go anywhere
to get you moving.

28:33.344 --> 28:34.946
So you're sure you
still want to do this?

28:34.981 --> 28:36.513
Why? Are you
getting cold feet?

28:36.548 --> 28:38.149
Aren't you the
one that broke into
the dean of students

28:38.184 --> 28:39.716
office and
stole the furniture?

28:39.751 --> 28:41.753
Yeah, well, somehow it seems
like there's a little more

28:41.788 --> 28:43.354
at stake here.

29:01.372 --> 29:03.374
I can't believe i let
you talk me into this.

29:03.409 --> 29:05.341
Who's got cold feet?

29:05.376 --> 29:08.580
Look, you wouldn't
be here if you weren't
willing to meet me halfway.

29:27.799 --> 29:29.400
We're in.

29:29.801 --> 29:31.768
Nicely done, miss bigelow.

29:31.803 --> 29:33.805
Now, what did
you want to show me?

29:39.410 --> 29:41.813
Check this out.

30:00.231 --> 30:02.634
From the look on your face, i'm
willing to take a wild guess

30:02.669 --> 30:04.636
i don't have a
lot of convincing to do.

30:04.671 --> 30:06.202
It's horrible.

30:06.237 --> 30:08.239
How could i have been
so completely taken in?

30:08.640 --> 30:11.042
Because you wanted to be?

30:11.077 --> 30:12.644
So now what?

30:13.044 --> 30:15.046
Now we get
the hell out of here.

30:15.081 --> 30:16.648
Okay. But how?

30:17.048 --> 30:19.050
Trust me.
I've done this before.

30:26.257 --> 30:28.224
You've got to
deactivate my governor.

30:28.259 --> 30:31.062
Come on, we
both know that you
deactivated yours

30:31.097 --> 30:33.029
the minute
you were alone.

30:33.064 --> 30:35.867
I guess you can read
me like a book, too, huh?

31:00.291 --> 31:01.893
We gotta get out of here.

31:07.498 --> 31:08.699
Adam?

31:08.734 --> 31:09.866
Emma?

31:09.901 --> 31:11.102
Where are you?

31:11.502 --> 31:12.669
Michelle and
i are leaving genomex.

31:12.704 --> 31:14.305
I need you to bring
the double helix over.

31:14.340 --> 31:15.506
Gotta go.

31:18.309 --> 31:24.315
I'm afraid you
two schoolgirls are about
to get permanent detentions.

31:27.919 --> 31:29.921
Emma just contacted
me with her comlink.

31:29.956 --> 31:31.340
She's in genomex.

31:31.375 --> 31:32.689
So what's the deal?

31:32.724 --> 31:34.290
She and her friend
are on the way out?

31:34.325 --> 31:36.327
Yeah, so i want you
to maintain your position,

31:36.728 --> 31:38.329
be ready to move
in on a moment's notice.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.337
After all the opportunities
i've offered you,

31:46.372 --> 31:48.304
miss bigelow, this
is how you repay me.

31:48.339 --> 31:49.941
You know, that's one of
your biggest problems,

31:50.341 --> 31:51.942
eckhart, it's just
not always about you.

31:51.977 --> 31:53.509
And that's where you're
wrong, miss delauro.

31:53.544 --> 31:55.546
And the sooner you learn that
you're nothing but a satellite

31:55.581 --> 31:57.548
that revolves around me,
we'll all be the better for it.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.167
After what i
saw on your database,

31:59.202 --> 32:00.752
i'm ashamed
i ever trusted you.

32:00.787 --> 32:02.318
Who do you think you are?

32:02.353 --> 32:04.320
It's not who i
think i am that matters;

32:04.355 --> 32:08.359
it's the fear i strike in others
that makes life worth living.

32:08.394 --> 32:10.361
And this is the
guy that you trusted.

32:10.762 --> 32:11.963
You know what?

32:11.998 --> 32:13.564
Yeah.

32:13.965 --> 32:16.367
We're both
over this place.

32:26.377 --> 32:27.578
Seal the complex.

32:27.613 --> 32:28.745
Yes, sir.

32:28.780 --> 32:29.981
Check level one.

32:41.225 --> 32:42.392
I know, i know.

32:42.427 --> 32:43.628
Adam's going
to be pissed.

32:44.028 --> 32:45.630
Yeah, just wait'll we
get you home, young lady.

32:45.665 --> 32:46.796
What were you thinking?

32:46.831 --> 32:48.032
Look, don't blame emma, okay?

32:48.067 --> 32:49.233
If you hadn't have done this,

32:49.634 --> 32:51.235
i'd still be working
for mr. Eckhart, right?

32:51.270 --> 32:52.437
All right. Take a seat.

32:52.837 --> 32:54.038
I don't really feel like
sticking around and duking it

32:54.073 --> 32:55.640
out with your gsa buddies.

33:01.646 --> 33:03.613
I've been thinking
about what you said.

33:03.648 --> 33:06.050
About the way
i deal with simulations as
opposed to the real thing.

33:06.085 --> 33:06.851
Yeah?

33:07.251 --> 33:08.453
Did you come
to any conclusions?

33:10.054 --> 33:11.656
Well, actually, i did a
little reading in the gestalt

33:11.691 --> 33:13.257
concept of the willing
suspension of disbelief.

33:13.292 --> 33:14.424
Yeah?

33:14.459 --> 33:16.025
Well,
that's pretty heady stuff.

33:16.060 --> 33:17.662
I mean, we're talking
about fighting holograms here.

33:17.697 --> 33:18.863
Well, right. That's my point.

33:19.263 --> 33:20.830
I mean, when i'm
fighting virtual gsagents,

33:20.865 --> 33:23.668
i can't seem to lose myself the
same way as in the real thing.

33:23.703 --> 33:24.834
Right.

33:24.869 --> 33:26.871
Which is why i
suggested that you apply
the same energy and

33:26.906 --> 33:28.473
the same effort that
you do in real combat.

33:28.508 --> 33:29.639
Maybe.

33:29.674 --> 33:31.641
You know, i think there
might be another answer.

33:31.676 --> 33:34.078
I mean, i still
get completely creeped
out by a good horror movie.

33:34.113 --> 33:35.897
And totally lost in...

33:35.932 --> 33:37.647
in an action flick.

33:37.682 --> 33:39.483
Rather than trying to pretend
that it's real when you know

33:39.518 --> 33:41.250
that it's a simulation, you
want to sort of give yourself

33:41.285 --> 33:44.088
over to the
virtual combat the way you
get sucked into a movie?

33:44.489 --> 33:46.491
Couldn't have
put it better myself.

33:46.526 --> 33:48.893
Now it sounds like fun.

33:48.928 --> 33:50.495
Whatever works.

33:57.702 --> 33:59.303
Don't worry - i disengaged
my tracking chip the same time

33:59.704 --> 34:02.071
i turned off
my subdermal governor.

34:02.106 --> 34:04.909
It's going to be weird
- meeting adam, i mean.

34:04.944 --> 34:06.876
Why weird?

34:06.911 --> 34:08.478
Well, let's not forget,

34:08.513 --> 34:10.514
i've only seen adam
through mr. Eckhart's eyes.

34:10.550 --> 34:12.734
Mr. Eckhart?

34:12.768 --> 34:14.918
Force of habit.

34:32.536 --> 34:33.737
They're here, adam.

34:34.938 --> 34:37.341
Now,
the minute she's inside,
let's get her into the lab.

34:37.742 --> 34:39.744
It's important that
we find out what eckhart
may have done to her

34:39.779 --> 34:42.547
genetic makeup
and what we may have
to do to countermand it.

34:51.355 --> 34:53.757
Oh, emma, you
said it was beautiful,

34:53.793 --> 34:56.159
but this place
is outrageous.

34:56.195 --> 34:57.979
Hey, michelle, welcome.

34:58.014 --> 34:59.764
Adam,
this is michelle.

34:59.799 --> 35:01.731
And that's jesse.

35:01.766 --> 35:03.367
Well,
we're glad you're here.

35:03.402 --> 35:04.969
We were
concerned about you.

35:05.004 --> 35:06.170
Concerned?

35:06.571 --> 35:07.737
Yeah, well, eckhart.

35:07.772 --> 35:09.373
You know, he's got
a longstanding history
of tinkering with

35:09.774 --> 35:11.340
the dna strands
of new mutants.

35:11.375 --> 35:14.143
And your genetic
makeup may seem
to be unbreakable,

35:14.178 --> 35:17.782
but there's a
certain fragility there that
needs to be reckoned with.

35:18.182 --> 35:21.385
Mr. Eckhart did
have his technical division
work on my genetic makeup.

35:21.420 --> 35:23.352
I see.

35:23.387 --> 35:24.954
I'm not surprised.

35:24.989 --> 35:27.792
Well, my concern
is that he might
have aggravated the

35:28.192 --> 35:31.796
emotional problems
that are a result of
your computer interaction.

35:31.831 --> 35:35.417
It's not an issue, adam.

35:35.452 --> 35:38.968
Weli... what do you mean?

35:39.003 --> 35:41.005
Thanks to
the genetic manipulation
performed on me by

35:41.040 --> 35:43.825
genomex technicians,
i have begun the process of

35:43.860 --> 35:47.037
successfully shedding
my organic form to begin the

35:47.072 --> 35:50.214
transformation from
meatware to living hardware.

36:32.657 --> 36:35.059
In a matter of moments, the
coordinates of all of mutant x's

36:35.094 --> 36:37.426
data will be at genomex.

36:37.461 --> 36:40.264
That's not going
to happen, michelle.

36:43.868 --> 36:45.870
I'm going to show you
what it's like to feel again,

36:45.905 --> 36:47.872
whether you like it or not.

36:59.884 --> 37:02.286
Don't waste
your time, emma.

37:08.693 --> 37:10.695
<laughing>

37:15.099 --> 37:17.501
not so robotic
now, huh, michelle?

37:22.306 --> 37:24.709
You can't
manipulate me like this.

37:24.744 --> 37:25.910
Try and stop me.

37:27.111 --> 37:28.713
<laughing>

37:32.316 --> 37:35.885
stop!

37:35.920 --> 37:38.723
I thought you had
no feelings or emotions.

37:38.758 --> 37:39.523
I don't.

37:39.924 --> 37:41.525
<laughing>

37:41.926 --> 37:44.128
i'm beyond emotions.

37:44.163 --> 37:46.047
What's wrong, michelle?

37:46.082 --> 37:47.932
A little uncomfortable?

37:47.967 --> 37:49.551
Frustrated?

37:49.586 --> 37:51.135
Scared?

38:02.747 --> 38:04.714
Did i kill her?

38:04.749 --> 38:06.350
I think you might have
just saved her life.

38:06.751 --> 38:07.551
You guys okay?

38:07.586 --> 38:08.352
Yeah.

38:08.753 --> 38:09.518
All right, hurry.

38:09.553 --> 38:10.755
Let's get
her into the lab.

38:11.155 --> 38:12.757
Fast.

38:31.175 --> 38:33.177
I'm busy, mr. Delay.

38:33.577 --> 38:35.544
I'm afraid i have
some bad news for you sir.

38:35.579 --> 38:38.382
A tech's telling me we've
lost contact with miss bigelow.

38:38.417 --> 38:41.185
Well, then
there's something wrong
with their scanners.

38:41.220 --> 38:43.988
Miss bigelow
is a perfect weapon.

38:44.388 --> 38:48.793
That may be,
mr. Eckhart, but i had them
do a complete systems check.

38:54.398 --> 38:56.801
She's gone.

39:02.406 --> 39:04.774
How could that be?

39:04.809 --> 39:08.377
The whole escape was a
perfect charade to get her into

39:08.412 --> 39:12.416
adam's world before the failsafe
self-destruct could go online.

39:12.451 --> 39:14.018
I understand, sir.

39:14.418 --> 39:18.022
But the fact remains,
miss bigelow has disappeared.

39:22.827 --> 39:26.796
Ohhh.

39:26.831 --> 39:34.038
Well, then, it would appear
that you can keep your job

39:34.073 --> 39:38.042
for just a little
while longer, mr. Delay.

39:54.458 --> 39:56.660
Emma?

39:56.695 --> 39:58.828
I'm here.

39:58.863 --> 40:01.230
And you're safe.

40:01.265 --> 40:03.267
<sighs> i am so sorry.

40:03.302 --> 40:05.269
I couldn't help myself.

40:05.304 --> 40:06.836
We know.

40:06.871 --> 40:09.673
Adam has reversed everything
that they did to you at the gsa.

40:10.074 --> 40:13.677
You're still a telecyber,
but you'll never lose control

40:13.712 --> 40:15.679
of your emotions again.

40:15.714 --> 40:17.646
<crying>

40:17.681 --> 40:19.683
feels pretty good, huh?

40:19.718 --> 40:21.685
<crying>

40:27.291 --> 40:34.098
<laughing>

40:34.133 --> 40:38.119
how is she?

40:38.154 --> 40:42.071
Worn out.

40:42.106 --> 40:44.108
She's so tired, she
fell asleep mid-sentence.

40:44.508 --> 40:50.915
Look, i wanted to
apologize to you guys.

40:51.315 --> 40:55.684
Where are
you going to start?

40:55.719 --> 40:57.321
Running away without
telling anybody?

40:57.721 --> 40:59.323
Yeah,
turning off your comlink?

40:59.723 --> 41:01.690
Hanging out with a gsagent?

41:01.725 --> 41:03.727
Okay, so i've got a
lot to apologize for.

41:03.762 --> 41:06.095
Forget about it.

41:06.130 --> 41:08.933
We've all been guilty
of running off when our past

41:08.968 --> 41:10.935
has caught up with us.

41:11.335 --> 41:13.137
Even adam.

41:13.172 --> 41:14.904
Even adam.

41:14.939 --> 41:20.544
We all live with one foot in
our old lives and one foot in

41:20.579 --> 41:22.546
the world we find ourselves now.

41:22.947 --> 41:25.349
Yeah, and sometimes
those two worlds just rub

41:25.384 --> 41:26.916
each other the wrong way.

41:26.951 --> 41:29.353
Yeah,
and every once in a while,
we get smacked in the back

41:29.388 --> 41:32.774
of the head from a blast
from our past, and, well,

41:32.809 --> 41:36.160
you know, that's what we're
for to make things right.

41:36.195 --> 41:38.162
That's what friends
are for, right?

41:38.197 --> 41:39.728
Yeah.

41:39.763 --> 41:41.765
Just don't push your luck.

41:46.971 --> 41:50.174
A gsagent.

41:50.209 --> 41:53.377
<laughing>

41:53.777 --> 41:55.344
i mean, a gsagent.

41:55.379 --> 41:56.981
What were you thinking?

41:57.016 --> 41:58.983
<laughing>
