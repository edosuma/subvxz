WEBVTT

00:09.700 --> 00:11.700
You sure you wanna
do this without Daphne?

00:11.900 --> 00:13.400
When Lilith and I got engaged,

00:13.700 --> 00:16.700
she insisted on being involved
with the ring selection process.

00:17.100 --> 00:19.800
I appreciate your concern,
but I wanna surprise her.

00:20.100 --> 00:23.100
How about this one?
It's nice and sparkling.

00:23.500 --> 00:25.200
- That's an earring, Dad.
Huh?

00:25.400 --> 00:27.700
- Oh. Guess I better put on my glasses.
- Yes.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.200
Aah. Niles,

00:30.400 --> 00:32.299
prepare to relinquish your breath.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.400
- Which one?
- That right there.

00:34.700 --> 00:36.700
Next to the gaudy one?

00:37.900 --> 00:39.500
The gaudy one?

00:39.800 --> 00:41.800
All right, all right,
which do you like?

00:42.100 --> 00:44.700
Something more along the lines
of that one, with the feathered band.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.500
- All right? What do you think?
- It's good I'm here to talk you out of it.

00:49.300 --> 00:51.500
I think I'm starting to regret
bringing you along at all.

00:51.800 --> 00:53.500
- I think it's a godsend...
- No, how much...?

00:53.800 --> 00:55.500
Gentlemen, I'm sure
we can find something

00:55.800 --> 00:59.100
that will bring you both
a lifetime of happiness.

01:00.400 --> 01:03.000
Oh, no, they're not a couple.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.400
My son Niles is here to pick out
an engagement ring

01:05.600 --> 01:06.900
for his girlfriend Daphne.

01:07.100 --> 01:11.100
And Frasier, who's been married twice,
just came along to help him.

01:11.800 --> 01:15.300
I'm very sorry. I'll come back when
you've had more time to look around.

01:17.500 --> 01:18.800
Where did that come from?

01:18.900 --> 01:23.400
I mean, really, to just assume
something like that out of the blue.

01:23.800 --> 01:26.300
Latent.

01:27.400 --> 01:31.000
Well, you gotta admit, it wasn't
such a big leap, given the situation.

01:31.200 --> 01:33.000
And just what is that supposed to...?

01:35.100 --> 01:40.700
What bejewelled seraph has escaped
her provenance now?

01:41.800 --> 01:44.300
I'm gonna go see if there's a line
at the Orange Julius.

01:44.900 --> 01:47.700
I have several candidates, but before
you turn up your nose at this...

01:47.900 --> 01:49.400
That's it.

01:49.600 --> 01:51.400
Right there. That's Daphne's ring.

01:51.700 --> 01:53.200
The very one
I was going to show you.

01:53.900 --> 01:55.500
- Stylish.
- Classic.

01:55.800 --> 01:56.800
Stunning.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.500
Daphne. Uh, excuse me?

02:00.900 --> 02:03.600
- I'd like to see that one, please.
- Excellent choice, sir.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.300
- Know her ring size?
- Even better.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.500
Her ring finger is exactly
the same size as mine.

02:08.699 --> 02:09.699
Oh.

02:09.900 --> 02:11.600
Well, perhaps you should
try this on then.

02:11.900 --> 02:13.600
Yeah. Ha, ha.

02:13.900 --> 02:16.400
Oh, it's... Oh.

02:16.700 --> 02:19.300
Oh! I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm a little nervous.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.000
It just hit me, what this all means.

02:21.300 --> 02:22.300
Ow.
- Oh.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.100
- What happened?
- Just my back.

02:24.300 --> 02:25.600
It's been acting up the last week.

02:25.900 --> 02:28.900
- You want me to give you a hand up?
- No, no, no, here. Here's the ring.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.100
- All right.
- I'll just stay here for a moment.

02:31.300 --> 02:32.400
Ah. Does it fit?

02:32.600 --> 02:34.200
- Look, here, let me help.
- No, I got it.

02:34.500 --> 02:35.500
Come on. Come on.

02:35.700 --> 02:37.600
Oh, Niles.

02:37.900 --> 02:40.700
Frasier, it's perfect.

02:40.900 --> 02:43.700
You know, I always dreamed
this would happen.

02:44.400 --> 02:48.000
No, wait. They're not a couple.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
<i>Look.</i>

02:50.200 --> 02:52.000
Oh, jeez.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:13.200 --> 03:15.000
Okay.

03:22.800 --> 03:23.900
Hey, Niles.

03:27.500 --> 03:30.600
- Is something wrong?
- No, no, I...

03:30.900 --> 03:32.300
Oh, my God.

03:32.500 --> 03:34.300
- Is that Daphne's proposal?
- What?

03:34.500 --> 03:36.300
No, I haven't... I don't...
What are you...?

03:36.500 --> 03:37.600
Frasier told me.

03:37.900 --> 03:43.000
- Ugh. That gossiping ninny.
- Don't worry, he swore me to secrecy.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.500
I swore him to secrecy.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.100
So how's it coming?

03:48.700 --> 03:51.400
I'm afraid I've poured so much emotion
into this speech,

03:51.800 --> 03:54.900
I don't know if I can say it all
without crying.

03:55.200 --> 03:59.900
Oh, that's okay. Women like a man
who isn't afraid to shed a few tears.

04:00.300 --> 04:03.600
Last time I got all the way through it,
I got dehydrated.

04:05.100 --> 04:06.800
Well, maybe if you cut it down
a little bit,

04:07.100 --> 04:09.400
you could get through it
before the waterworks start.

04:09.700 --> 04:12.600
- Let me take a look?
- Oh.

04:15.100 --> 04:16.800
Well, what about
this paragraph here?

04:17.100 --> 04:20.399
And aren't words
like "hopeless" and "despairing"

04:20.800 --> 04:23.300
kind of a downer in a proposal?

04:23.600 --> 04:25.900
This is where I describe
my life before I met her.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.700
See? And then comes the part

04:28.000 --> 04:31.500
where she comes along, and the metre
changes to a more sprightly iambic.

04:31.800 --> 04:34.200
Hmm.
- Now my life has meaning.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.600
Things that never made sense before,
suddenly are clear.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.200
It's all because of this

04:42.900 --> 04:44.800
wonderful woman.

04:46.100 --> 04:50.000
It's all right. I'm sure there's other stuff
we can cut. Thank you.

04:51.400 --> 04:52.900
Okay, like here.

04:53.100 --> 04:57.100
I mean, now, do you really have to
compare her to three different roses?

04:57.400 --> 04:59.500
Well, which one
would you have me eliminate?

04:59.800 --> 05:03.700
The one that represents her beauty,
or her passion, or her...?

05:05.100 --> 05:07.000
Her sense of humour?

05:08.800 --> 05:12.800
Niles, you're just making this
too complicated.

05:13.100 --> 05:17.700
You know, all we really want is
for a guy to get down on one knee,

05:18.100 --> 05:20.700
and say, "I love you.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.500
Will you be my wife?"

05:31.100 --> 05:33.100
Excellent. Nice bite.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.100
Smooth, oakey blend.

05:36.400 --> 05:37.700
Mm-hm. Lovely finish.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.900
Yeah, I think this is definitely
a contender. How about you, Dad?

05:41.200 --> 05:43.100
Well, this one dislodged
that piece of pot roast

05:43.300 --> 05:45.200
that's been bugging me since lunch.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.600
I'm sorry, Niles,

05:49.900 --> 05:52.000
but I'm just not the right guy
to help you pick a wine

05:52.200 --> 05:53.400
for your proposal dinner.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.400
Well, Dad, this is
an important night for me

05:55.700 --> 05:58.600
and I want you to play
an important part.

05:58.800 --> 06:02.000
I guess it is an honour
to be included. Thanks.

06:02.400 --> 06:07.200
Well, time to cleanse my palate.
I'm gonna get a beer.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.100
- Now.
- Not yet.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.400
Exactly how drunk
does he have to get?

06:14.600 --> 06:17.000
To agree to take Daphne's mother out
while you propose to her?

06:17.300 --> 06:18.700
Drunk, Niles.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.500
Fill her up, fill her up.

06:20.600 --> 06:21.700
Go ahead.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Whoopsie.
- Oh.

06:24.300 --> 06:26.000
You sure he hasn't had enough?

06:26.600 --> 06:30.300
Dad, what was the name of that widow
you dated several years ago?

06:30.500 --> 06:32.400
You mean Claire Wojodubokowski?

06:32.700 --> 06:34.200
Not yet.

06:36.600 --> 06:38.400
Well,

06:39.000 --> 06:41.900
my taste buds are all sudsy clean.

06:43.500 --> 06:46.300
Well, let's dive right back in.
Bottoms up.

06:59.600 --> 07:00.700
Boy,

07:00.900 --> 07:03.000
I tell you, I haven't had
this much to drink

07:03.300 --> 07:06.600
since the night
I proposed to your mother.

07:07.300 --> 07:08.800
- Really?
Yeah.

07:08.900 --> 07:10.700
That was quite a night.

07:10.900 --> 07:12.400
I was nervous as hell.

07:12.700 --> 07:14.600
- Oh, I love this story.
Yeah.

07:14.900 --> 07:17.600
- And then she said no.
What?

07:17.900 --> 07:19.300
I've never heard this version.

07:19.600 --> 07:22.400
Well, she wanted to get married,
but she just wasn't ready.

07:22.700 --> 07:25.500
Well, what was it that finally
convinced her to say yes?

07:25.700 --> 07:27.100
Oh, you don't wanna know.

07:27.300 --> 07:28.800
Oh, come on, Dad.

07:29.100 --> 07:33.700
What Marty Crane magic did you
weave to get her to change her mind?

07:34.400 --> 07:38.200
Actually, I didn't
change her mind, Fras.

07:38.600 --> 07:40.100
You did.

07:44.200 --> 07:46.000
- Oh, dear God.
Ha.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.700
I'll never forget the look
on that minister's face

07:49.900 --> 07:54.500
when your mother waddled
down the aisle at Saint Barthalolamew.

07:54.900 --> 07:57.400
You hear what I said?
"Barthalomar. "

07:58.000 --> 07:59.900
Dad, there's a question
I've been meaning to ask.

08:00.200 --> 08:03.100
Niles, how can you change the subject
after this bombshell?

08:04.700 --> 08:06.400
You knew?

08:06.600 --> 08:08.100
Remember that time
I had the chickenpox?

08:08.400 --> 08:10.200
Mom told me to cheer me up.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.700
- Oh, go ahead.
- Thank you.

08:19.300 --> 08:22.300
So, uh, listen, ahem, Dad,

08:22.600 --> 08:25.400
Daphne and I, of course,
wanna be alone on the big night...

08:25.600 --> 08:27.700
Oh-ho, yeah.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.900
And I was wondering if, perhaps,

08:30.200 --> 08:32.700
you could take Daphne's mother
out for the evening.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
You want me to take out
Daphne's mother?

08:36.400 --> 08:39.299
- Is that what this has all been about?
- No. More wine?

08:39.600 --> 08:41.100
Ugh.

08:41.400 --> 08:44.900
I can't stand that woman.

08:45.500 --> 08:48.100
But if it'll help you out, sure,
I'll do it, I'll go out with her.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.200
Oh, Dad,

08:50.300 --> 08:52.900
thank you. I will never forget this.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.200
Forget what? Ha. Just kidding.

08:56.500 --> 08:57.900
Ha, ha. Oh.

08:59.200 --> 09:02.600
- Hello, all.
- Hello, how was the movie?

09:03.000 --> 09:04.100
Oh, not bad,

09:04.300 --> 09:06.800
considering my daughter's
famous sense of direction

09:07.000 --> 09:08.700
made us 45 minutes late.

09:08.900 --> 09:11.000
Then she got me popcorn
without butter,

09:11.200 --> 09:12.400
and kept shushing me,

09:12.600 --> 09:16.600
just because I can predict
what people will say next in a movie.

09:18.800 --> 09:22.400
- Hello, Marty.
- Uh. Excuse me.

09:23.900 --> 09:26.700
I need a beer. Now, now.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.300
Dad,

09:29.600 --> 09:31.500
you know what
we were just talking about,

09:31.700 --> 09:36.100
the fact that I was
a guest at your wedding?

09:38.000 --> 09:39.500
Yeah?

09:40.600 --> 09:45.500
Well, it's just the least bit startling.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.100
And I have always respected
you and mother,

09:49.300 --> 09:52.300
and the decisions that you made
throughout your lifetime.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.500
But this information does

09:55.200 --> 09:57.600
beg one question:

09:58.600 --> 10:00.000
Dad,

10:00.600 --> 10:02.300
am I...?

10:03.000 --> 10:06.400
A year older? No.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.000
Your birthday's the same.

10:08.300 --> 10:10.000
We just faked our anniversary
all these years.

10:10.300 --> 10:11.900
Oh, thank heaven. Oh-ho.

10:20.200 --> 10:23.800
You know, Marty,
I'm not surprised you asked me out.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.800
- Um, you're not?
- Oh, don't be coy.

10:27.200 --> 10:30.300
A romantic boat ride
to a remote island.

10:30.600 --> 10:32.900
I know when a man's
trying to seduce me.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.500
Uh...

10:34.700 --> 10:38.000
- Mrs. Moon...
- Oh, it was inevitable, really.

10:38.300 --> 10:40.600
I mean, here we are,

10:40.900 --> 10:44.400
two comfortable old shoes
looking for new mates.

10:44.700 --> 10:47.100
Actually, I'm not that comfortable.

10:47.400 --> 10:50.300
Oh, maybe you just need
someone to break you in.

10:52.200 --> 10:55.100
- Isn't that Marty Crane from work?
- Right.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Didn't you two
have a thing going on?

10:59.200 --> 11:01.900
No, we just made out
at the office party.

11:02.200 --> 11:03.800
Then what happened?
He blew you off?

11:04.100 --> 11:06.300
Actually, I think he was
kind of interested.

11:06.500 --> 11:09.100
He slipped a note in my lunch,
he drove past my house,

11:09.300 --> 11:11.000
he called me couple of times
and hung up.

11:11.200 --> 11:14.700
And you didn't do anything.
What were you thinking? He's cute.

11:14.900 --> 11:16.700
He is cute, isn't he?

11:17.000 --> 11:18.600
What a wonderful sunset.

11:18.800 --> 11:22.300
I bet you ordered it just for me,
didn't you, Marty?

11:22.600 --> 11:25.700
Actually, the sun goes down
almost every night.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.200
Oh, you, stop making me
fall in love with you.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.400
Uh, you know,

11:32.700 --> 11:35.400
I think there's been
a bit of a misunderstanding here.

11:35.700 --> 11:39.000
I didn't mean this to be a "date" date.

11:39.300 --> 11:42.400
More of a friendship thing. You know,
I really enjoy your company...

11:42.700 --> 11:45.000
No. No.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.400
I should have known.

11:47.700 --> 11:50.800
What could you possibly want
with a dried-up old prune like me?

11:51.000 --> 11:54.700
- Well, you're not a dried-up old...
- Please, I don't want your pity.

11:55.100 --> 11:57.800
I'll just stand at the bar
and drink all night.

11:58.100 --> 12:01.300
Even though my doctor said one more
episode could cost me my liver.

12:01.700 --> 12:04.300
- Oh, now, come on...
- If you want to pretend

12:04.500 --> 12:06.700
not to know me,
I'll understand completely.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.500
Look, you've misunderstood
what I said.

12:09.800 --> 12:13.500
Oh, then you don't think
I'm unattractive?

12:13.800 --> 12:16.900
Oh, unattractive?

12:17.400 --> 12:20.100
You said that, not me.

12:20.600 --> 12:22.800
It's not too late.
Go over there and say hello.

12:23.100 --> 12:24.900
He's with somebody. It'd be weird.

12:25.200 --> 12:27.200
You don't have to make a play for him.
Just say hello.

12:27.500 --> 12:30.100
You can tell by his reaction
whether or not he's still interested.

12:30.400 --> 12:31.600
Gertrude,

12:31.800 --> 12:33.300
this is wrong.

12:33.600 --> 12:35.600
Your husband just left you.

12:35.900 --> 12:37.600
You're vulnerable.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.300
I'm not vulnerable.

12:39.500 --> 12:42.200
I'm ripe and receptive.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.400
Okay.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
I'll tell you the truth.

12:46.200 --> 12:50.900
Uh, you know, I was shot, right?

12:51.300 --> 12:52.400
Yes, in the hip.

12:52.700 --> 12:56.700
Except that the damage
wasn't confined to the hip.

12:57.100 --> 13:00.700
There were fragments that travelled

13:01.200 --> 13:02.800
south.

13:03.900 --> 13:06.200
- Oh, you mean...?
- Yep.

13:06.400 --> 13:08.900
- Yeah, but you can still...
- Nope.

13:09.100 --> 13:11.500
- But they have pills now...
- No.

13:12.900 --> 13:15.800
- Acupuncture?
- Ooh. Don't remind me.

13:17.400 --> 13:22.000
No, the sad fact is,
it just doesn't work.

13:23.300 --> 13:29.100
I have absolutely no sexual feeling
in my groin area, period.

13:31.800 --> 13:36.600
Oh, Marty, that's terrible.
Oh, I am sorry I brought it up.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.400
Oh, that's all right. No harm done.

13:48.800 --> 13:51.400
Excuse me, Mr. Puck?

13:51.700 --> 13:53.800
Yes, Dr. Crane.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.500
I couldn't help noticing

13:55.700 --> 13:59.300
that the crab cakes
are getting just a bit brown.

13:59.700 --> 14:04.100
- They're getting beautifully crunchy.
- I see.

14:04.500 --> 14:05.600
Because when I said brown,

14:05.700 --> 14:09.100
I actually meant more like black,
like burned.

14:09.400 --> 14:10.700
They're Cajun.

14:12.800 --> 14:16.600
- Everything all right in here?
- With the food, no problem.

14:18.600 --> 14:22.500
Everything's under control, Niles.
We're all set. You just relax, okay?

14:22.700 --> 14:25.400
I can't believe it. I've worked so hard
to make everything perfect,

14:25.800 --> 14:28.100
and now the moment is almost...

14:28.400 --> 14:30.600
Do I smell burning crab?

14:30.800 --> 14:32.400
That's Cajun.

14:35.400 --> 14:39.100
- That's her.
- Go, go. Godspeed!

14:40.500 --> 14:41.900
Everyone, everyone, places, places.

14:43.400 --> 14:44.800
Coming, my sweet.

14:51.200 --> 14:54.700
- Are you all right?
- Don't touch me, I have the flu.

14:55.700 --> 14:59.100
Oh, you poor dear.
Here, here, here, come here.

14:59.500 --> 15:02.000
Sit right down here
till we're ready to eat.

15:02.200 --> 15:05.500
Oh, I can't eat.
I need my mouth to breathe.

15:05.800 --> 15:09.500
Ugh. I hope you didn't go
to too much trouble with dinner.

15:12.800 --> 15:15.500
Oh, no, no. Hey, you know what?

15:15.800 --> 15:18.500
A good cup of tea,
and you'll be rallying in no time.

15:18.800 --> 15:21.100
You'll never guess
what I have planned for tonight.

15:21.400 --> 15:23.400
All I want to do
is stuff Kleenex up my nose,

15:23.700 --> 15:26.600
collapse on the couch,
and pray for death.

15:28.700 --> 15:30.500
Keep guessing.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.900
- I'm sorry, Niles.
- Oh, that's all right.

15:36.500 --> 15:40.900
There. You lie here. I'll go heat up
some soup in the kitchen.

15:44.100 --> 15:47.000
- Dinner's off.
- What did you say?

15:47.200 --> 15:50.200
Look, Niles, even if the crab cakes
are a write-off, we can still salvage...

15:50.600 --> 15:52.000
No, no, no.

15:52.200 --> 15:54.300
Daphne's sick. Oh, oh, Wolfgang,

15:54.500 --> 15:57.300
could you open a can of plain
chicken broth and heat it up for me?

15:59.900 --> 16:01.500
You're just cancelling everything?

16:01.700 --> 16:05.000
- The choir, string quartet, the dry ice?
- Yes, all of it.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.800
I want this proposal to be
the greatest night of Daphne's life.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.500
What's the point if she's too sick?

16:09.800 --> 16:11.200
We spent weeks
pulling this together.

16:11.400 --> 16:14.400
We'll just get everybody back
sometime when she's feeling better.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.900
Not everybody.

16:22.100 --> 16:25.000
All right, listen. I'll take Daphne
into the guestroom to lie down

16:25.200 --> 16:27.300
so you can get everybody out of here.
Just be quiet.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.100
Don't wanna blow the surprise
for next time.

16:29.300 --> 16:31.500
Rest assured,
she won't suspect a thing.

16:31.800 --> 16:35.700
Niles, I think
there's a bird loose in here.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.300
I thought doves
might be a nice addition.

16:42.300 --> 16:43.700
It looked like a dove.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.900
Oh. I think your fever
is causing you to hallucinate.

16:54.800 --> 16:58.600
Come along, let's take you
to the guestroom for a good lie-down.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.600
- Why you yelling?
- Because your ears are all stuffed up.

17:01.800 --> 17:04.200
- No, they're not.
- They're not? Oh, maybe mine are.

17:04.400 --> 17:06.599
Gee, I hope I'm not getting
what you have.

17:17.800 --> 17:20.300
Shh. Everyone, everyone. Shh.

17:20.599 --> 17:23.000
Very quietly,
I have an announcement to make.

17:24.800 --> 17:27.000
I'm terribly sorry,
but tonight's festivities

17:27.200 --> 17:31.300
have been indefinitely postponed
due to illness.

17:31.600 --> 17:34.900
- But we still get paid, right?
- Yes, you still get paid.

17:35.200 --> 17:40.200
Um, now, I need all of you to file
quickly and quietly out the front door.

17:40.500 --> 17:43.600
It is imperative the young lady
not know any of you were ever here.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.400
I'm telling you,
that room has a draught.

17:46.700 --> 17:48.600
Hit the dirt.

17:48.900 --> 17:51.200
We can't we sit
in the living room, build a fire?

17:51.400 --> 17:53.700
No, no, no, we can't go
in the living room because...

17:54.700 --> 17:56.200
That...

17:57.300 --> 17:59.700
Of course we can go in the living room
and have a nice fire.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.500
Come here and sit down.

18:01.700 --> 18:04.000
Oh, um, do you wanna borrow
my pyjamas?

18:04.300 --> 18:05.800
No, I feel silly in those.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.100
They're so big and baggy.

18:07.200 --> 18:09.800
I'm the only one here
who's gonna see you.

18:18.800 --> 18:22.200
- Oh, how about some tea?
- Hmm. Not now.

18:27.700 --> 18:30.300
Oh, I have some of those
raspberry candies you like.

18:30.600 --> 18:34.300
No, you stay right here
next to me, Niles Crane.

18:38.300 --> 18:40.200
I'll get you a blanket.

18:40.400 --> 18:43.600
You'll catch a chill, darling.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.200
Get you all comfy.

18:45.400 --> 18:47.500
Oh, I'm sorry I ruined our evening.

18:47.800 --> 18:49.900
Oh, you did nothing of the sort.

18:50.400 --> 18:53.800
- Don't know what I did to deserve you.
- You kidding?

18:54.200 --> 18:57.600
- I got the better end of this deal.
- Oh, yeah, look at me.

18:57.800 --> 19:02.200
Nose running, hair a mess.
I must look a real fright.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.700
You are simply
the most adorable creature

19:21.000 --> 19:23.100
I have ever seen on this earth.

19:23.300 --> 19:25.400
- Oh, I'm sure.
- No, I mean it.

19:25.600 --> 19:29.800
From your beautiful toes,
all the way up to your crusty nose,

19:30.200 --> 19:33.500
there's not an inch of you
that I don't adore.

19:42.900 --> 19:44.900
- You know, it's funny.
- Mm.

19:45.100 --> 19:48.700
You could take a million years
to plan the perfect evening

19:49.000 --> 19:51.300
and you would
never come up with this.

19:52.700 --> 19:55.000
Daphne, I have to ask you
a question.

19:57.400 --> 19:58.800
Hold on.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.300
You were saying?

20:19.300 --> 20:21.100
Daphne Moon,

20:21.800 --> 20:23.300
will you,

20:24.000 --> 20:25.800
and your beautiful toes,

20:26.500 --> 20:28.700
and your exquisite ankles,

20:28.900 --> 20:32.100
and your precious knees,

20:32.500 --> 20:35.100
elbows and arms

20:35.700 --> 20:39.100
and fingers and shoulders...?

20:42.400 --> 20:44.300
Will you marry me?

20:46.500 --> 20:51.000
Oh, Niles, of course I will.
