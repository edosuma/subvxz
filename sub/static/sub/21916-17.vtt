00:05.236 --> 00:09.043
Previously on Mystery Incorporated...

00:09.163 --> 00:11.028
Damnation! That's it!

00:11.148 --> 00:14.993
Come back here. I got a double barrel
surprise for you.

00:15.113 --> 00:17.178
Look who decided to wake up.

00:17.298 --> 00:18.810
Nova...

00:18.930 --> 00:21.751
All my best *** buddies were interesting
in some females.

00:21.871 --> 00:24.064
They're doing a smackdown
on the cheese buffet.

00:24.184 --> 00:27.974
I guess I secretly hoped you guys
might not try to steal the pieces from us.

00:28.094 --> 00:29.919
Don't expect me home for dinner.

00:30.039 --> 00:32.006
And we're taking Nova with us, too.

00:32.125 --> 00:33.286
Let's see what it looks like.

00:33.355 --> 00:35.482
The whole planispheric disc!

00:35.602 --> 00:38.598
These children are proving hard to handle.

00:38.859 --> 00:41.745
We must find another way.

00:41.865 --> 00:43.222
Our office!

00:43.342 --> 00:44.278
What happened?

00:44.398 --> 00:46.107
No idea. Some mystery.

00:46.227 --> 00:49.639
Good thing nobody was inside.
Somebody could have gotten real hurt.

00:54.591 --> 00:56.425
How's the lemonade?

00:56.493 --> 00:57.960
Honey, the lemonade?

00:58.028 --> 00:59.308
Oh, what do you want me to say?

00:59.329 --> 01:00.729
Tastes like lemonade.

01:00.797 --> 01:02.297
Why are you always sniffing
around for validation?

01:02.364 --> 01:03.898
I'm drinking it, ain't I?

01:03.966 --> 01:05.233
Hmph!

01:05.300 --> 01:06.867
Shh! Shh!

01:06.935 --> 01:08.769
Don't you shush me.
I was...

01:08.837 --> 01:10.003
- No. Shush shush.
- Huh?

01:10.071 --> 01:11.405
Something's out there.

01:13.975 --> 01:15.876
Sounds like the cows
are restless.

01:15.944 --> 01:19.879
Martha, we ain't run cattle
on this farm for 25 years.

01:19.947 --> 01:22.949
Huh? What?
What happened to the lights?

01:28.121 --> 01:31.089
Either your sisters
just showed up,

01:31.157 --> 01:34.426
or these are the ugliest
cows I ever seen.

01:36.463 --> 01:39.765
It's some kind of
horrible herd.

01:42.737 --> 01:44.771
- Aah!
- Run!

01:46.000 --> 01:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:55.683 --> 01:59.519
Climb, Martha.
Climb for your life.

02:33.590 --> 02:36.325
Scooby-Dooby Doo!

02:44.001 --> 02:46.502
Here you go.
This is the last plate

02:46.570 --> 02:49.172
of our world famous
floor scraps from the grave.

02:49.239 --> 02:51.741
Enjoy.

02:51.808 --> 02:53.575
Here, Nova, my love.

02:53.643 --> 02:56.011
I want you to have
the first bite.

02:58.114 --> 02:59.347
Hee hee hee.

02:59.415 --> 03:04.519
I just love the way
you consume.

03:06.288 --> 03:08.756
So, like, I don't understand.

03:08.823 --> 03:12.594
The planispheric disk led us to
dig up this crazy old flintlock.

03:12.661 --> 03:14.596
Does that mean
this is the treasure?

03:14.663 --> 03:15.764
No.

03:15.831 --> 03:17.365
It might be worth
a little something

03:17.433 --> 03:18.600
as an antique,

03:18.668 --> 03:20.188
but the cursed treasure
of Crystal Cove

03:20.203 --> 03:23.606
is supposed to be immense
beyond all imagining.

03:23.674 --> 03:28.446
Like love.

03:28.513 --> 03:31.182
Here's your cheese platter
of the forever undead.

03:31.250 --> 03:33.117
It's all we had left.

03:33.184 --> 03:35.820
Excuse me,

03:35.887 --> 03:38.122
but this Port Salut
is not from Brittany.

03:38.189 --> 03:39.723
And this Cotswold
Double Gloucester

03:39.791 --> 03:41.091
is well past its prime.

03:41.159 --> 03:42.727
Sorry, but we're out of food.

03:42.794 --> 03:44.228
In fact, we're down
to selling food

03:44.296 --> 03:46.063
from the dumpsters
of other restaurants.

03:46.131 --> 03:47.765
What? Why?

03:47.833 --> 03:50.768
Another of the local farms
has been mysteriously destroyed.

03:50.836 --> 03:52.170
The fifth this week.

03:52.237 --> 03:54.772
It's really messing
with our food deliveries.

03:54.840 --> 03:58.175
Mysteriously destroyed?

04:03.848 --> 04:05.015
You!

04:05.083 --> 04:06.283
Farmer.

04:06.351 --> 04:07.484
Dog.

04:07.552 --> 04:10.053
Lock up any innocent
animals lately?

04:10.121 --> 04:12.823
Like, ok, you two,
we know you've got history,

04:12.890 --> 04:15.025
but go easy on
the animosity there.

04:15.093 --> 04:17.795
Remember, your girlfriend
is watching, Scoob.

04:17.862 --> 04:20.498
You're right.
Sorry, Nova.

04:23.869 --> 04:25.103
Ahh.

04:25.170 --> 04:28.506
I just love the way
she rolls in the dirt.

04:28.574 --> 04:30.141
Excuse me, Mr. farmer.

04:30.208 --> 04:31.509
What happened to your farm?

04:33.278 --> 04:35.779
Farm? I ain't got no farm.

04:35.847 --> 04:37.849
It's gone, all of it.

04:37.916 --> 04:41.285
That horrible herd ate
everything except the silo.

04:41.353 --> 04:44.655
Martha, we are leaving.

04:44.723 --> 04:46.723
Like, did I just heard
you say hear?

04:46.791 --> 04:48.459
I mean, uh, ha ha ha,

04:48.526 --> 04:49.893
hear you say herd.

04:49.961 --> 04:51.829
- Herd of what?
- Skull cattle.

04:51.896 --> 04:54.231
Ugliest darn things.

04:54.299 --> 04:56.534
Guys, look at these
weird hoof prints.

04:56.602 --> 04:58.169
They don't make any sense.

04:58.237 --> 05:00.905
If you really want to get
all nosy about it,

05:00.973 --> 05:03.475
you should talk to
the other farmers in the area.

05:03.543 --> 05:06.878
The herd paid them
a visit, too.

05:11.417 --> 05:14.386
So you're saying that
this herd of skull cattle

05:14.453 --> 05:15.954
also destroyed your farms?

05:16.022 --> 05:17.656
What's the matter with you?

05:17.723 --> 05:20.258
You got potatoes
in your ears, huh?

05:20.326 --> 05:22.526
Huh?

05:22.594 --> 05:24.562
Nope, not today.

05:24.630 --> 05:27.098
I once had luminescent
swamp moss stuffed in my ears

05:27.166 --> 05:28.667
when I was trapping toads
as a baby.

05:28.734 --> 05:29.701
But it came out....

05:29.769 --> 05:30.869
Eventually.

05:30.937 --> 05:32.104
Aye.

05:32.172 --> 05:33.439
Please, go on.

05:33.507 --> 05:35.908
Like a plague of locusts
they was.

05:35.976 --> 05:40.179
Coming out of the night, they
devoured everything in their path.

05:41.415 --> 05:42.682
I reckon she's right.

05:42.750 --> 05:43.817
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

05:43.884 --> 05:46.453
Yeah, dog?
You've got a question?

05:46.520 --> 05:48.622
I do. What's to eat
around here?

05:48.690 --> 05:50.624
My girlfriend Nova's hungry.

05:50.692 --> 05:52.460
Like, shaggy is, too.

05:52.527 --> 05:55.529
We got crackers and crackers.

05:55.597 --> 05:59.934
Anything else to add
a little, I don't know, flavor?

06:01.202 --> 06:04.538
We found this here
sweet cheesy stuff on the road

06:04.605 --> 06:07.441
after them skull cattle
went by.

06:07.509 --> 06:09.543
Road kill sweet cheese?

06:09.610 --> 06:11.278
That is just...

06:11.345 --> 06:12.712
Beyond disgusting.

06:12.780 --> 06:14.614
Mmm.

06:14.682 --> 06:18.918
Speak for yourself.
It's sweet cheese-errific.

06:20.154 --> 06:22.622
It's some kind of
aged honey cheese.

06:22.690 --> 06:25.925
Can you give us any other
details, any other clues?

06:25.993 --> 06:31.230
Yeah. Just before that horrible
herd of skull cattle attacked,

06:31.297 --> 06:36.435
- the ground started to...
- Shake.

06:36.503 --> 06:39.938
What in tarnation?

06:40.006 --> 06:41.139
Huh?

06:41.207 --> 06:44.075
Like, I hope this
is a coincidence.

06:44.142 --> 06:47.411
I don't think so.
Come on!

06:57.757 --> 07:00.492
It's the horrible herd.

07:00.559 --> 07:02.861
Time to go.

07:31.858 --> 07:33.192
Freddy, drive faster.

07:33.260 --> 07:34.860
Faster!

07:57.459 --> 07:58.626
Aah!

07:59.070 --> 08:01.084
- Freddy.
- Everybody hang on.

08:01.193 --> 08:02.894
Daph, hit the boosters.

08:07.934 --> 08:09.201
Heh heh heh.

08:09.269 --> 08:12.238
Nova, just let me know
if you need anything.

08:12.306 --> 08:15.309
I want you to think
of this as your home.

08:16.978 --> 08:18.679
Like, Scooby-Doo, old pal,

08:18.746 --> 08:21.515
we're doing the "gather
around behind Velma

08:21.582 --> 08:23.984
while she researches
stuff" thing.

08:24.052 --> 08:25.486
Care to join us?

08:25.553 --> 08:27.855
Mwah.

08:27.923 --> 08:30.524
I mapped all the attacks
on all the farms in the area,

08:30.592 --> 08:33.928
and look, they create
an outline of a magnifying glass

08:33.996 --> 08:37.799
just like the one the old Mystery
Incorporated used as their symbol.

08:37.866 --> 08:40.001
It's centered around Destroido.

08:40.068 --> 08:43.004
Cute little moo cows
turned into horrible monsters.

08:43.072 --> 08:46.909
There's only one mind evil enough to
come up with something like that.

08:46.976 --> 08:49.044
Professor Pericles.

08:49.112 --> 08:52.182
Velma, is there anyway we can spy
on the old Mystery Incorporated?

08:52.249 --> 08:55.685
Didn't you say hot dog water
hooked us up somehow at Destroido?

08:55.753 --> 08:57.354
I almost forgot.

08:57.421 --> 08:59.256
Hot dog water left us
a back door

08:59.323 --> 09:01.324
into the Destroido
security system

09:01.392 --> 09:03.727
when she was there stealing
the planispheric disk pieces.

09:03.794 --> 09:05.128
Can you get more volume?

09:05.196 --> 09:08.598
You have gone too far
this time, Pericles.

09:08.666 --> 09:10.167
Too far!

09:10.234 --> 09:13.337
This macabre herd of
skull cattle you've created

09:13.405 --> 09:16.207
is costing millions
of Destroido's money.

09:16.275 --> 09:17.608
My money.

09:17.676 --> 09:20.878
And I currently have
28 of my best scientists

09:20.946 --> 09:23.114
listed as presumed missing.

09:23.182 --> 09:25.951
No, no! Aah!

09:26.018 --> 09:27.652
Make that 29.

09:27.720 --> 09:30.555
Ricky, one cannot make
a genius omelet

09:30.623 --> 09:33.058
without breaking
a few worthless eggs.

09:33.125 --> 09:34.559
Right, Brad and Judy?

09:34.627 --> 09:36.460
You said it,
Professor Pericles.

09:36.528 --> 09:38.162
He's a genius, right, Brad?

09:38.230 --> 09:40.897
He sure is, Judy.
He sure is.

09:40.965 --> 09:43.733
And make no mistake, Ricky,

09:43.801 --> 09:47.170
I will break any egg
that gets in my way...

09:47.238 --> 09:52.242
Ed Machine, Cassidy Williams,
or perhaps even you.

09:52.309 --> 09:56.313
My herd of skull cattle
is perfect in every way.

09:56.380 --> 10:00.783
I have crossbred cows,
piranhas, and bees

10:00.851 --> 10:03.086
to create ultimate monsters.

10:03.154 --> 10:04.922
And I'm their master.

10:04.990 --> 10:09.627
My precious creations
exist for one purpose...

10:09.694 --> 10:12.430
to devour Crystal Cove.

10:12.497 --> 10:14.799
My herd of male drones

10:14.866 --> 10:17.201
shall level this city
to the ground,

10:17.269 --> 10:20.171
leaving nowhere for
the Mystery kinder

10:20.238 --> 10:22.439
to hide the planispheric disk.

10:22.507 --> 10:24.609
Like, he's gonna destroy
Crystal Cove.

10:24.676 --> 10:27.678
Come on, gang.
We have to warn the town.

10:28.614 --> 10:30.615
Oh, Janet Mayor Nettles.

10:30.683 --> 10:32.617
This is so amazing.

10:32.685 --> 10:36.256
I just learned how to make
a sombrero out of bacon.

10:36.324 --> 10:38.392
And here I thought
these couple's cooking classes

10:38.460 --> 10:40.627
were gonna be
Lame-O-Roma city.

10:42.030 --> 10:43.664
Oh, the sparkle of
this oily fat

10:43.732 --> 10:45.633
really brings out your eyes.

10:45.700 --> 10:46.969
And your lips.

10:47.036 --> 10:49.404
Oh, Bronson.
Kiss me.

10:49.472 --> 10:51.640
Mayor Nettles,
we have terrible news.

10:51.708 --> 10:54.076
A herd of carnivorous genetically
engineered skull cattle

10:54.144 --> 10:55.845
is going to eat Crystal Cove.

10:55.912 --> 10:57.913
Like, we have to
evacuate the town.

10:57.981 --> 11:00.683
Now.

11:00.751 --> 11:03.919
Mmm. Is that
a bacon sombrero?

11:03.987 --> 11:05.521
Yummy.

11:05.589 --> 11:06.855
Keep your paws

11:06.923 --> 11:09.491
off the maple-cured
head gear, talking dog.

11:09.559 --> 11:11.393
Now, what is all this
nonsense about?

11:11.461 --> 11:13.195
Skull cattle? Please.

11:13.263 --> 11:14.596
There's no such thing.

11:14.664 --> 11:17.532
And no such things
can't eat towns.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.833
Sheriff, come quick.

11:18.901 --> 11:21.570
A herd of skull cattle
are eating the town.

11:21.637 --> 11:23.438
Mm-hmm.

11:23.506 --> 11:26.467
Of course, I've been wrong
about these things before.

11:29.630 --> 11:32.263
Look, the herd is destroying
all the roads.

11:53.745 --> 11:55.445
Gang, this is all our fault.

11:55.512 --> 11:56.746
Isn't it always?

11:56.813 --> 11:58.280
Maybe we should just
give Pericles

11:58.347 --> 11:59.614
the planispheric disk.

11:59.682 --> 12:01.115
Like, no way.

12:01.182 --> 12:03.015
A treasure beyond all imagining

12:03.083 --> 12:05.350
in the clutches of
an evil psychotic parrot?

12:05.418 --> 12:07.718
Would be devastating
on a global scale.

12:07.786 --> 12:09.219
Shaggy's right.

12:09.287 --> 12:10.920
There has to be another way.

12:10.988 --> 12:13.589
Well, you Mystery dorks
better decide quick

12:13.657 --> 12:15.290
because those nasty
cow thingies

12:15.357 --> 12:18.225
sealed off the town completely.

12:32.503 --> 12:37.303
Soon Crystal Cove
will cease to exist

12:37.371 --> 12:40.307
and the planispheric disk
shall be mine.

12:40.375 --> 12:44.941
Then no one will ever
stand in my way again.

12:57.815 --> 12:59.802
All the roads leading
in and out of the city

12:59.922 --> 13:00.956
have been eaten.

13:01.023 --> 13:02.757
They're cutting us off.

13:02.825 --> 13:06.929
Perhaps as a species
our time is over.

13:06.996 --> 13:08.931
It's evolution, people.

13:08.998 --> 13:11.366
We should all submit
to the herd.

13:11.434 --> 13:13.401
I think I'll see if
they're hiring any sheriffs.

13:13.469 --> 13:17.839
Bronson, although I find your
immediate surrender oddly endearing,

13:17.907 --> 13:19.441
you're not going anywhere.

13:19.509 --> 13:22.377
Kids, there must be a way
to stop these things.

13:22.445 --> 13:23.678
I think I have it.

13:23.746 --> 13:26.214
It's all the little pieces,
all the clues.

13:26.282 --> 13:28.350
Especially the fact
that Professor Pericles

13:28.418 --> 13:30.819
referred to all the skull
cattle as male drones.

13:30.887 --> 13:32.821
And then there's
the sweet cheese.

13:32.889 --> 13:35.290
I think I see where
you're going with this, Daph.

13:35.358 --> 13:38.426
If Scooby and I can eat
all that honey sweet cheese,

13:38.494 --> 13:41.430
those things will starve
and we'll save the town.

13:41.498 --> 13:42.631
Count me in.

13:42.699 --> 13:45.200
I'm ready to eat my way
to victory.

13:45.268 --> 13:46.769
That's not what I was thinking.

13:46.836 --> 13:48.203
They're like bees.

13:48.271 --> 13:49.972
The herd is all male drones.

13:50.039 --> 13:52.973
So there must be a queen
in the cow hive at Destroido.

13:53.041 --> 13:56.042
Daphne, that's so genius
I should have thought of it.

13:56.109 --> 13:58.277
They'll be totally protective
of their queen.

13:58.344 --> 14:00.245
If we could capture
the queen cow...

14:00.313 --> 14:02.914
We could use her to lead
the herd away from the town.

14:02.982 --> 14:04.182
Saving Crystal Cove.

14:04.250 --> 14:06.251
I don't know.
I don't know.

14:06.319 --> 14:10.422
I think my plan of letting
the herd enslave humanity

14:10.489 --> 14:11.890
is pretty darn good.

14:11.958 --> 14:13.491
My fake father mayor dad,

14:13.559 --> 14:15.593
used to keep a helicopter
here at city hall.

14:15.661 --> 14:18.963
I still have it.
Quick, it's our only chance.

14:21.200 --> 14:22.633
Jump in, kids.

14:22.700 --> 14:25.334
I flew Black Hawks during
my time in the air force.

14:25.402 --> 14:27.670
Mind if I play co-pilot?

14:27.738 --> 14:29.504
And I literally mean play

14:29.572 --> 14:33.274
because I have no idea
how to fly a helicopter.

14:33.342 --> 14:37.311
Oh, Bronson. You can be
my co-pilot any day.

14:37.379 --> 14:39.480
Mmm.

14:40.983 --> 14:42.350
Can you two cut it out?

14:42.418 --> 14:46.887
Besides, we have
a town to save.

14:51.493 --> 14:53.860
They're getting away,
Professor Pericles.

14:53.928 --> 14:54.995
What should we do?

14:55.062 --> 14:56.796
For the moment, nothing.

14:56.864 --> 15:00.032
The kinder do not have
the planispheric disk with them.

15:00.100 --> 15:03.502
They have hidden it
somewhere below.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.938
Mayor Nettles, over there.

15:07.006 --> 15:10.574
I think that's the entrance
to the cow hive.

15:11.776 --> 15:14.478
All right, gang,
our one chance is to get in,

15:14.546 --> 15:17.280
find her, and trap her in a
trap that will make history.

15:17.348 --> 15:20.183
No one's ever trapped a cow
that was also a queen

15:20.250 --> 15:22.818
that was also a bee
and a piranha.

15:22.885 --> 15:25.019
Now, go, go, go.

15:41.036 --> 15:43.338
Here, use these smoke guns.

15:43.405 --> 15:44.472
Nice, Freddy.

15:44.540 --> 15:46.174
Like for bees only bigger.

15:46.241 --> 15:49.844
Daph, you holding that
industrial-size smoke gun,

15:49.912 --> 15:51.746
it's...it's...

15:51.814 --> 15:53.080
Yes?

15:53.148 --> 15:55.349
It makes your
unusually large hands

15:55.417 --> 15:56.917
look really small for once.

15:56.985 --> 15:58.552
I like it.

15:58.620 --> 16:01.255
Oh, Freddy.

16:11.499 --> 16:14.034
Thanks for the warning, Nova.

16:15.737 --> 16:17.906
Come on, let's keep moving.

16:51.440 --> 16:53.601
Let's trap us a queen
cow bee piranha monster thingy.

17:14.628 --> 17:17.329
Ok, shag, Scoob,
the trap is all set.

17:17.396 --> 17:18.596
Bring her this way.

17:18.664 --> 17:20.763
How come we always get
the hard part?

17:20.832 --> 17:23.500
Like, I think they're
just jealous of our good looks.

17:23.568 --> 17:26.202
Good point.
Let's do this.

17:32.041 --> 17:33.275
Yoo-hoo!

17:45.018 --> 17:47.620
Aah!

17:49.657 --> 17:53.327
Good girl, Nova.

17:57.732 --> 18:00.000
Run, Scoob!

18:02.402 --> 18:04.703
Heads up!

18:09.341 --> 18:12.977
- Now!
- Aah!

18:13.044 --> 18:15.513
We got her.
Lift her up, mayor.

18:41.241 --> 18:42.675
It's working.

18:42.742 --> 18:44.676
The herd is abandoning
its attack on Crystal Cove

18:44.744 --> 18:46.812
and is coming to protect
their queen.

18:49.982 --> 18:53.485
They are ruining
my genius plan.

18:53.552 --> 18:55.754
Brad, Julie,
launch the missile.

18:55.821 --> 18:58.390
Really?
What did that cost?

18:58.458 --> 19:00.092
We have a missile?

19:00.160 --> 19:02.161
Yes, we have a missile,

19:02.228 --> 19:04.397
you pudding face dummkopf.

19:04.464 --> 19:06.365
Now fire it.

19:09.503 --> 19:11.504
Huh?

19:13.941 --> 19:17.510
Incoming!

19:33.627 --> 19:35.629
Nova, hang on.

19:37.265 --> 19:39.400
Nova!

19:39.467 --> 19:42.169
Aah!

19:45.573 --> 19:48.808
We've got to cut
the queen loose.

20:23.143 --> 20:24.544
Nova.

20:24.611 --> 20:27.346
She can't be gone.

20:27.414 --> 20:28.581
Don't worry, old pal.

20:28.649 --> 20:29.849
We'll find her.

20:32.586 --> 20:33.853
You did it, kids.

20:33.921 --> 20:35.288
You saved the town.

20:35.356 --> 20:37.457
I feel a little sorry
for those skull cattle.

20:37.525 --> 20:41.529
It's not their fault they're horrible
genetically engineered mutations.

20:41.596 --> 20:43.998
Look.

20:50.339 --> 20:51.973
Those things are part fish,
remember?

20:52.041 --> 20:53.508
They can swim.

20:58.280 --> 20:59.547
Whoa.

20:59.615 --> 21:00.815
What have we done?

21:00.883 --> 21:02.350
You mean, like,
other than release

21:02.418 --> 21:05.253
unnatural super predators
into the ecosystem?

21:05.321 --> 21:07.989
It's best to just walk away
from this one, kids.

21:08.056 --> 21:11.858
Just walk away.

21:16.399 --> 21:17.900
Nova.

21:17.968 --> 21:20.303
Nova!

21:24.742 --> 21:26.075
Nova!

21:26.143 --> 21:28.745
Scooby-Doo, over there.

21:32.450 --> 21:33.583
Nova.

21:35.553 --> 21:36.920
She's alive.

21:36.987 --> 21:39.622
Come on, we have to get her
to the hospital.

21:45.161 --> 21:50.599
My plan, ruined by those
meddling kinder.

21:50.667 --> 21:53.902
They will pay.
All of them.

21:53.970 --> 21:56.605
They will pay.

21:56.945 --> 22:07.168
