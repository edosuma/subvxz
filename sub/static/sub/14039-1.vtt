00:54.960 --> 00:57.120
My gratitude to you all.

00:57.160 --> 01:01.360
Many years have passed since your prince
has tread upon his native soil.

01:01.400 --> 01:06.440
So let us now welcome home
T'Challa, the son of Wakanda.

01:11.160 --> 01:13.560
- They hate me.
- Give it time.

01:15.240 --> 01:17.480
Intruders! Intruders!

01:26.000 --> 01:28.480
Father, you are in no condition
to deal with this.

01:28.480 --> 01:31.360
I implore you to listen
to the prince, Your Highness.

01:31.360 --> 01:33.680
You have yet to heal
from the previous attacks!

01:33.680 --> 01:35.400
- The royal guard should...
- No, Nakinda.

01:35.400 --> 01:40.200
- We cannot afford to lose any more.
- Father, please, don't go. Not now.

01:40.200 --> 01:44.320
I've missed you, son.
We will have our time together.

01:44.360 --> 01:45.560
I promise.

01:45.560 --> 01:47.200
At least allow me to go with you.

01:47.240 --> 01:49.840
As you will one day come to accept...

01:50.000 --> 01:53.760
this responsibility belongs
only to the king.

02:35.320 --> 02:39.080
Your prowess in battle
never fails to entertain.

02:39.120 --> 02:41.920
But after so many performances...

02:41.920 --> 02:45.720
I am here to insure your retirement.

03:00.120 --> 03:01.240
Father!

03:01.680 --> 03:05.280
So, the prodigal prince has returned.

03:05.320 --> 03:09.600
Now the royal bloodline
can finally end here.

03:09.600 --> 03:12.840
All over the jungle floor.

03:12.840 --> 03:16.080
You will not touch my son!

03:23.040 --> 03:24.080
Father!

03:34.080 --> 03:35.000
Father.

03:47.560 --> 03:48.720
No!

05:57.640 --> 05:58.840
Father.

06:07.120 --> 06:08.520
Your Highness.

06:10.880 --> 06:12.320
Come with me.

06:17.160 --> 06:19.280
The Eye of Kings.

06:21.720 --> 06:25.400
The right of access has now been
handed down to you.

08:15.120 --> 08:18.400
- You were supposed to call for backup.
- I didn't need it.

08:18.440 --> 08:20.600
This is the last time
you do this to me.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.840
And look! You're wounded again.

08:22.880 --> 08:26.920
Steve, I know what you're doing.
Believe me, I have been there.

08:27.040 --> 08:30.840
You cannot fill your life with this.
It will kill you.

08:31.080 --> 08:32.440
Then let it.

08:45.800 --> 08:48.440
So what are we now?
A one man army?

08:48.480 --> 08:50.160
You left me no choice.

08:50.160 --> 08:54.360
I'm just doing my job, General. That's
why you thawed me out for, isn't it?

08:54.520 --> 08:57.920
You wanna be back on ice? Is that it?
Because that's where you're headed.

08:57.920 --> 09:00.520
- Feet first, with a toe tag.
- If you'll excuse me, Sir,

09:00.520 --> 09:02.880
I'm signed on with Bravo team
for a warehouse raid.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.240
Not any more.

09:05.080 --> 09:06.680
What's happened to you, son?

09:06.960 --> 09:09.560
- Why are you such a mess?
- I'm fine, Sir, really.

09:09.560 --> 09:12.400
No, you're not.
You need R and R like anyone else.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.240
- I'm a super soldier!
- You're a man!

09:14.240 --> 09:17.240
Now be straight with me.
Why are you dodging the downtime?

09:17.240 --> 09:18.840
I'd just rather keep busy,
that's all.

09:18.840 --> 09:21.000
You got something against
having a personal life?

09:21.000 --> 09:23.480
It hurts less when
you're fighting, doesn't it?

09:23.480 --> 09:27.240
- You don't know anything about me.
- I know that you are afraid of peace.

09:27.240 --> 09:30.880
Because the moment you have it,
a normal life seems within your grasp,

09:30.920 --> 09:33.200
and you don't want
to lose that again.

09:33.360 --> 09:36.200
Steve, listen. You got a right
to be a little screwed up

09:36.200 --> 09:39.240
after a sixty-year deep freeze.
But that's the past.

09:39.240 --> 09:42.240
You killed the Chitaurii,
you made the world safe again.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.440
It's time to start letting go.

09:44.800 --> 09:45.880
Yes, General.

09:48.640 --> 09:51.520
He will not listen, you know.
He never does.

09:51.520 --> 09:54.680
He'd better,
or I'll lock him up with Banner.

09:59.880 --> 10:04.440
Dr. Banner, please
stay focused on the video.

10:05.600 --> 10:08.280
That's good. Very good.

10:08.600 --> 10:11.920
At which point
did you lose control over Hulk?

10:12.000 --> 10:15.400
Was it here...
Dr. Banner?

10:15.640 --> 10:17.120
I think so!

10:17.240 --> 10:20.400
- Elaborate, please.
- We've been over this!

10:20.640 --> 10:24.720
You do want the court to have a clear
picture of what went on, don't you?

10:25.280 --> 10:27.240
Don't you, Dr. Banner?

10:27.360 --> 10:29.240
Now let's start again.

10:29.360 --> 10:32.400
You made a conscious decision
to become the Hulk.

10:32.400 --> 10:33.600
Why?

10:33.600 --> 10:35.840
We were under attack by aliens.

10:35.840 --> 10:39.840
- Elaborate, please.
- It was the only way to stop them!

10:40.600 --> 10:42.160
The only way?

10:42.160 --> 10:44.600
Are we being honest, Dr. Banner?

10:44.720 --> 10:46.920
Weren't others involved?

10:46.920 --> 10:48.800
The Avengers, perhaps.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.320
Yet when they came to assist,
you turned on them.

10:52.320 --> 10:53.520
Why is that?

10:53.840 --> 10:56.040
Please answer the question.

10:56.040 --> 10:59.920
Here's a question for you, Oiler.
Did you ask for this job?

10:59.920 --> 11:03.680
I mean, I'm the guy who booted
you off the SSP team last year.

11:03.680 --> 11:05.880
- So this is payback, right?
- Dr. Banner!

11:05.880 --> 11:09.000
Attacking others is what you do!
Not me.

11:09.120 --> 11:10.800
I want to see Betty Ross.

11:11.040 --> 11:13.640
She has been made aware
of your request.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.480
Get her down here now!

11:16.360 --> 11:17.880
Hit him with the sedative.

11:28.720 --> 11:32.960
We'll start again once
you've had a chance to... relax.

11:33.040 --> 11:36.320
Keep the video on a continuous loop.

11:36.600 --> 11:37.800
Yes, Doctor.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.280
Who are you?

13:04.640 --> 13:06.760
He's called the Black Panther.

13:08.160 --> 13:11.800
All right, everyone, I got this.
Return to your posts.

13:11.800 --> 13:13.040
You heard him, move it!

13:17.720 --> 13:19.800
A little far from home, aren't you?

13:22.640 --> 13:24.320
Where's T'Challa?

13:24.880 --> 13:28.240
He is... I, am king
of Wakanda now.

13:28.480 --> 13:30.960
And I demand to speak alone
with Captain America.

13:30.960 --> 13:34.160
Now look, your father and I never
got off on the right foot. Why don't

13:34.160 --> 13:37.080
- you and I do things differently?
- It is a private matter.

13:37.200 --> 13:41.000
- I keep no secrets from General Fury.
- My father was killed, four days ago.

13:41.040 --> 13:42.200
By this man.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.440
Kleiser!

13:44.680 --> 13:47.040
I thought he died in 1945.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.600
- I must know how to stop him.
- You can't.

13:52.600 --> 13:53.400
Why?

13:53.400 --> 13:56.200
Because I killed him twice,
and he always comes back.

13:56.200 --> 13:58.120
You need to open your borders.

13:58.120 --> 14:01.000
The Avengers are your only chance
of defeating the Chitaurii.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.120
No. Outsiders are forbidden.

14:03.120 --> 14:05.440
You're the king now,
change that law.

14:05.480 --> 14:08.160
I've betrayed my people enough
just by coming here.

14:10.560 --> 14:12.440
There's nothing you can tell me?

14:20.960 --> 14:22.560
Assemble the Avengers.

14:37.680 --> 14:39.000
You're looking good, hon'!

14:48.680 --> 14:50.920
Just a minor spike
in your insulin levels.

14:56.080 --> 14:59.400
Up the plasma I.G.F.
concentration to 850 u.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.720
Muscular composition is fluctuating.

15:05.680 --> 15:07.600
We're getting a dip
in lean body mass!

15:10.360 --> 15:12.840
Lumbar spine density
is at 84 and rising!

15:16.440 --> 15:19.640
Pulsatile and diurnal outputs
are off the charts!

15:19.880 --> 15:22.360
Hank, you're crashing,
we have to terminate!

15:22.360 --> 15:25.200
No, no! Just get me to 61 ft.

15:27.440 --> 15:28.640
Stabilize him.

15:28.640 --> 15:31.680
Anabolic levels are too erratic,
he's gonna stroke out!

15:33.800 --> 15:35.440
Bring him down, slowly.

15:35.680 --> 15:36.560
Yeah.

15:43.880 --> 15:45.680
You just blew two months of work!

15:45.680 --> 15:47.400
We were beyond the safety margin.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.040
Hank, this is not worth your life!

15:49.040 --> 15:52.320
- My life, my risks!
- No, it's your ego!

15:52.440 --> 15:55.560
60 ft, it's the maximum strain
your body can endure.

15:55.560 --> 15:59.160
Let's just put a pin in it, and refocus
on the other phase of the project.

15:59.160 --> 16:01.720
Other phase?
What, you mean shrinking?

16:02.240 --> 16:04.240
You can put a pin in that too, Janet.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.360
If we don't start
reconditioning your body,

16:07.360 --> 16:09.280
it will never handle
the reduction in size!

16:09.280 --> 16:10.200
Forget it!

16:10.480 --> 16:13.040
I'm not going back to being
a two-inch superhero.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.960
Janet, you have a call
from General Fury's office.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.800
Tell her we refuse to supply
any transitional hardware

16:41.800 --> 16:43.960
unless their programming is compatible.

16:43.960 --> 16:46.720
Oh and, Jarvis, send her flowers too.

16:46.720 --> 16:49.720
With an apology for...
Well, she'll know.

16:49.720 --> 16:52.160
Certainly, Sir.
And on another matter,

16:52.120 --> 16:55.480
<i>shall I reschedule your meeting</i>
with the company's vice presidents?

16:55.480 --> 16:58.240
No need, I brought them with me.

17:05.920 --> 17:08.280
Sir, I've got General Fury for you.

17:08.839 --> 17:10.599
I have to call him back.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.520
Come on!

17:34.960 --> 17:35.800
Sir?

17:35.840 --> 17:38.320
- What, Jarvis?
- The team is gathering.

17:38.320 --> 17:39.840
Tell Fury to sit tight.

17:39.840 --> 17:41.320
I'll be there when I can.

17:42.760 --> 17:45.520
OK, rest time is over.
Let's go.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.440
Professor Ross!

18:37.880 --> 18:40.600
What could have made it so brittle?

18:50.520 --> 18:55.440
- Hey, Betty!
- Hey, you!

18:57.360 --> 18:59.320
So, how are things going?

19:00.800 --> 19:02.360
We're working things out.

19:03.080 --> 19:05.240
What about you? How's Bruce?

19:05.200 --> 19:07.800
I... haven't been to see him yet.

19:09.640 --> 19:10.920
Daddy's home!

19:11.680 --> 19:13.880
What? No hug for me?

19:14.800 --> 19:17.240
- How about you, big guy?
- Shut up, Stark.

19:17.880 --> 19:20.240
Ah! It's good to be back.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.240
- Bruce?
- Betty!

19:31.600 --> 19:34.640
I'm so glad you're here.
Do you know what's been going on?

19:34.640 --> 19:36.680
Fury has brought me up on charges.

19:36.680 --> 19:39.600
I know. I've been called as a witness.

19:39.640 --> 19:43.960
I realize the Hulk made a disaster of
things, but he did get rid of the aliens.

19:43.960 --> 19:46.120
- No, he didn't.
- What?

19:46.120 --> 19:48.360
- What are you saying?
- They're still out there.

19:49.080 --> 19:51.120
I just thought you should know.

19:51.600 --> 19:54.680
- Wait! What's Fury doing about it?
- Nothing that concerns you.

19:54.680 --> 19:57.480
Please, Betty,
I need something to think about.

19:57.480 --> 19:59.360
Something besides guilt.

20:01.840 --> 20:04.280
We're analyzing the alien wreckage
from the battle.

20:04.280 --> 20:05.480
What have you found?

20:05.600 --> 20:09.720
Not much, but sections of the Vibranium
hull have become brittle.

20:09.760 --> 20:12.080
- We don't know why.
- Can I see a piece of it?

20:12.080 --> 20:13.760
- If we work together...
- Are you insane?

20:13.760 --> 20:16.440
No one wants your help,
and no one trusts you any more.

20:16.440 --> 20:18.200
Betty, don't go, Betty!

20:26.120 --> 20:31.200
Steve, I know about Kleiser.
So, if you'd like to talk...

20:31.200 --> 20:34.560
There's nothing to talk about.
When I find him, I'm going to kill him.

20:34.680 --> 20:35.880
Once and for all.

20:35.880 --> 20:37.160
OK, listen up.

20:40.480 --> 20:44.920
Herr Kleiser, commander of Nazi Germany
covert Totenkopf Division.

20:46.200 --> 20:49.240
Only Kleiser's allegiance
wasn't to the third Reich.

20:49.440 --> 20:52.720
In reality, he was
a Chitaurii shape-shifter.

20:52.720 --> 20:54.560
The only one we know of.

20:54.680 --> 20:56.840
Kind of their super soldier.

21:03.400 --> 21:06.360
He was assumed killed on May 2nd, 1945,

21:06.360 --> 21:09.720
when his nuclear warhead was
sabotaged above the North Atlantic.

21:18.840 --> 21:21.800
So like our Captain,
Kleiser has survived.

21:21.920 --> 21:25.640
We know this because he just
assassinated the king of Wakanda.

21:25.800 --> 21:29.400
That tells me there's some kind
of alien agenda still in play.

21:29.400 --> 21:31.160
What do we know about Wakanda?

21:31.280 --> 21:32.480
Very little.

21:32.480 --> 21:35.720
They're an isolationist nation
we're unable to take a look at.

21:35.840 --> 21:39.360
Satellite surveillance is blocked.
And undercover efforts have failed.

21:39.520 --> 21:42.320
Bottom line:
they don't want us in there.

21:42.480 --> 21:44.840
Sounds like a reason
to pay them a visit.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.920
General, I want to go in alone.

21:47.120 --> 21:49.040
- No one knows Kleiser and...
- Sorry, Cap',

21:49.080 --> 21:51.480
- this one is a team effort.
- He'll kill everyone!

21:51.480 --> 21:53.240
Just let him go, Fury!

21:53.280 --> 21:56.760
If old Stars and Stripes is nursing
a grudge against that alien Nazi,

21:56.760 --> 21:58.080
why drag us into it?

21:58.080 --> 22:00.600
Like I said, it's a team effort.

22:00.760 --> 22:04.480
We go in under the radar, gather
information, and get out fast.

22:04.480 --> 22:07.360
I don't need an international
incident in the middle of all this.

22:07.400 --> 22:09.560
All the more reason
to send me in alone.

22:09.560 --> 22:12.280
This one needs a clear head
in the lead, Captain.

22:12.280 --> 22:14.080
You're carrying too much baggage.

22:14.080 --> 22:16.400
Widow, you'll be in command.

22:17.240 --> 22:18.720
Demoted!

22:18.680 --> 22:21.440
I guess that makes him
Private America, huh?

22:21.640 --> 22:22.920
This is for certain.

22:22.920 --> 22:26.040
The Chitaurii wouldn't assassinate
a king just for kicks.

22:26.200 --> 22:27.960
They're up to something over there.

22:28.160 --> 22:30.000
And I want to know what it is.

23:11.680 --> 23:13.760
- Father?
- T'Challa.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.120
What are you doing here?

23:15.120 --> 23:17.400
I heard you arguing with the elders.

23:18.360 --> 23:20.920
We do not always see eye to eye.

23:20.920 --> 23:23.280
They don't want you to send me
away to school, do they?

23:23.280 --> 23:24.680
No, they do not.

23:24.680 --> 23:25.880
Then why do it?

23:25.880 --> 23:28.880
Because I believe
the future king of Wakanda

23:28.880 --> 23:31.440
should know something
of the outside world.

23:31.440 --> 23:32.760
I do not understand.

23:32.760 --> 23:34.840
Changes are on the horizon, son.

23:34.840 --> 23:37.360
Our nation must know
how to change with it.

23:37.400 --> 23:40.600
- But if the elders believe...
- A good king knows what is right.

23:40.600 --> 23:42.840
Even when others tell him it is wrong.

23:42.840 --> 23:45.040
I do not ever want to be king, Father.

23:45.520 --> 23:48.640
Some day, T'Challa,
you will be a great leader.

24:10.160 --> 24:13.120
Fan out, 20 meters spread.
And report what you find.

24:16.920 --> 24:18.880
Wasp, check above the canopy.

24:19.160 --> 24:20.040
Got it!

24:24.120 --> 24:28.240
Hey, Cap', you know, ever since
I first learned about you in school,

24:28.280 --> 24:31.800
- there's something I've wanted to know.
- Is this really the best time, Tony?

24:31.800 --> 24:34.480
- Well, there may not be another time.
- What is it?

24:34.480 --> 24:37.520
When you decided to jump out
of this rocket, back in 1945,

24:37.520 --> 24:39.200
did you think
you'd come out of it alive?

24:39.800 --> 24:40.800
Non.

24:41.160 --> 24:45.160
- Really? You're a better man than me.
- That's not true.

24:45.160 --> 24:48.080
Hey, I'm fine with it. You got
the guts, I go for the glory.

24:48.080 --> 24:50.040
I'm not interested
in posthumous awards.

24:50.040 --> 24:52.080
You'll never really know
until the time comes.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.000
Taylor, report. Taylor!

25:12.440 --> 25:13.600
I'm sorry, Cap'!

25:51.840 --> 25:53.640
- Stop!
- Panther!

25:53.720 --> 25:56.120
- You should not be here.
- It's all right.

25:56.080 --> 25:57.680
You must leave immediately!

25:57.680 --> 26:01.560
We came for answers, and we're not
going anywhere until we get them.

26:06.240 --> 26:08.040
I will not warn you again.

26:08.080 --> 26:09.920
Please, you wanted my help,

26:09.920 --> 26:12.120
- I'm here to give it to you.
- I sought your advice.

26:12.120 --> 26:13.440
Not your involvement.

26:13.360 --> 26:16.080
This man, Kleiser,
he killed your father,

26:16.080 --> 26:18.560
but he also killed
many people very close to me.

26:18.600 --> 26:21.000
You and I, we're after the same thing.

26:21.080 --> 26:26.240
All right, come with me. But only you.
The others must return to their ship.

26:34.560 --> 26:35.440
Come.

26:37.320 --> 26:39.680
- You must not be seen.
- Why?

26:40.720 --> 26:43.480
Wouldn't your people understand
if you told them we were here to help?

26:43.480 --> 26:45.960
No. Because we never needed any help.

27:06.200 --> 27:07.920
Is that a Chitaurii ship?

27:08.040 --> 27:11.640
Yes, shot down in 1942.
Come this way.

27:11.640 --> 27:12.800
Wait...

27:15.080 --> 27:16.520
Your people shot it down?

27:16.760 --> 27:20.080
There's more to Wakanda
than what appears on the surface.

28:03.240 --> 28:04.720
What is this place?

28:04.840 --> 28:09.560
The Hall of Kings. All of
our past leaders are interred here.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.840
This one holds my grandfather.

28:12.040 --> 28:17.200
Azari the Wise. It was during his reign
that the Chitaurii first arrived.

28:17.440 --> 28:20.640
My grandfather met with their leader
in hope of advancing peace.

28:20.680 --> 28:24.280
That leader... was Kleiser.
But Kleiser didn't want peace.

28:24.320 --> 28:27.360
He wanted war,
and the very life blood of our land.

28:27.360 --> 28:28.440
Life blood?

28:29.040 --> 28:33.960
Our most sacred possession.
We call it the Heart of Wakanda.

28:35.080 --> 28:37.520
Kleiser sought to take it by force.

28:41.480 --> 28:42.880
The Wakandans rose up,

28:42.880 --> 28:46.680
and eventually defeated them.
But our nation was deeply scarred.

28:46.720 --> 28:50.760
We became an untrusting people, and
all trespassers became our enemy.

28:50.760 --> 28:54.320
So, what could Kleiser be planning now?
Do you have any idea?

28:54.320 --> 28:59.320
No. But I believe my father did. He had
been preparing me for this very time.

28:59.640 --> 29:01.960
I intend to avenge his death, Captain.

29:02.320 --> 29:04.520
I understand.
More than you know.

29:04.520 --> 29:07.320
- Sire! Intruders have been...
- Nakinda!

29:07.360 --> 29:09.000
What have you done?

29:12.360 --> 29:14.080
They have found your friends.

29:18.040 --> 29:20.360
Come out, come out!
Wherever you are!

29:30.960 --> 29:32.560
Don't make me hurt you!

29:37.080 --> 29:39.440
Knock it...
Knock it off!

29:45.320 --> 29:46.720
Get away from him!

30:02.600 --> 30:05.480
Spears? I'm afraid you'll have
to do better than that!

30:06.800 --> 30:07.840
Or not.

30:14.080 --> 30:15.680
Well, that's embarrassing.

30:22.040 --> 30:23.640
End this fighting now!

30:27.800 --> 30:33.120
I said stop! It is I who allowed
these outsiders to be here.

30:35.320 --> 30:36.960
Hank's been poisoned!

30:36.960 --> 30:38.800
I will provide him with an antidote,

30:38.800 --> 30:40.760
but only if you leave here now.

30:42.720 --> 30:46.160
And if you return, they will kill you.

30:55.640 --> 30:58.520
I recommend regrouping with
additional forces, General.

30:58.520 --> 30:59.680
Then we can return...

30:59.680 --> 31:02.480
I'm not picking a fight with
Wakanda, not until I have to.

31:02.520 --> 31:03.360
But, General...

31:03.360 --> 31:06.720
- Return to base for Cap's debriefing.
- Yes, Sir.

31:07.440 --> 31:10.520
General, Prof. Ross is still waiting
for you in the hangar.

31:10.520 --> 31:13.560
Tell her I'm on my way.
Any progress on locating Thor?

31:13.560 --> 31:14.560
Sorry, Sir.

31:14.560 --> 31:17.560
He's been a no show at every
environmental protest on the planet.

31:17.600 --> 31:20.560
Keep checking every hippy rally
you can think of.

31:28.200 --> 31:30.920
Father, I seek your guidance.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.520
The death vision I have been given...

31:47.760 --> 31:51.480
Reveal to me...
what does it portend?

31:51.480 --> 31:53.520
What befalls the Avengers?

31:59.840 --> 32:01.080
I must warn them!

32:01.120 --> 32:04.200
Midgaard has turned
its back on the gods.

32:04.200 --> 32:06.960
You are not to become involved, my son.

32:06.960 --> 32:08.680
But I am involved.

32:08.680 --> 32:12.400
You have meddled in the affairs
of man far too often.

32:12.400 --> 32:14.280
Now leave them to their fate.

32:14.280 --> 32:16.920
Father, I must do what is right.

32:16.960 --> 32:19.280
I forbid you from aiding them.

32:20.200 --> 32:22.720
Return to Asgaard, at once.

32:22.720 --> 32:25.360
I cannot. Forgive me.

33:00.640 --> 33:02.520
Prof. Ross.
What do you have?

33:02.680 --> 33:06.000
This. The inner core of each ship
possessed a block

33:06.000 --> 33:08.400
of Vibranium denser
than any I've seen yet.

33:08.400 --> 33:10.080
Some kind of power source?

33:10.080 --> 33:11.280
I think so.

33:11.360 --> 33:14.640
We know Vibranium absorbs energy.
So, it makes sense.

33:15.080 --> 33:17.760
Now, watch what happens
when I try to tap into it.

33:33.320 --> 33:35.600
There's probably enough energy
stored in that cube

33:35.600 --> 33:39.080
to power New-York for six months.
I can't even get a reading.

33:39.200 --> 33:41.400
What about
the brittle sections of the hull?

33:41.440 --> 33:43.280
- Any connection?
- I doubt it.

33:43.360 --> 33:47.080
But they do seem to be concentrated
in one general area.

33:56.640 --> 34:02.200
Now, when you developed the super soldier
formula only for yourself,

34:02.240 --> 34:04.720
did you feel remorse
over the deception?

34:05.120 --> 34:07.160
I need to see Professor Ross.

34:07.160 --> 34:09.639
Please answer the question, Dr. Banner.

34:09.639 --> 34:12.000
No, look! That's the answer!
Right there!

34:12.040 --> 34:14.239
Dr. Banner, try to stay focused...

34:14.239 --> 34:17.080
Shut up, you pandering quack,
and get me Betty Ross!

34:19.360 --> 34:22.760
No! I have to tell her!
I have the answer! I...

34:24.600 --> 34:27.600
Dr. Oiler, isn't that an unsafe dosage?

34:27.520 --> 34:31.199
What's unsafe is letting that man
get too angry again.

34:45.880 --> 34:47.560
There's a Chitaurii down there.

34:51.639 --> 34:54.440
There's nothing we can do.
We've been ordered back to base.

35:01.360 --> 35:03.160
Steve, don't do this!

35:13.280 --> 35:15.560
- Follow that shuttle!
- Let him go!

35:16.040 --> 35:19.400
I mean it! If the guy wants to go rogue,
who are we to stop him?

35:19.400 --> 35:21.920
Are you serious?
You'd leave him down there to die?

35:21.920 --> 35:24.920
Hey, if you ask me,
he'd be doing this team a favor.

35:25.720 --> 35:27.440
I can't believe you just said that.

35:27.480 --> 35:30.760
OK, this ship's suddenly
gotten very small.

35:31.360 --> 35:33.680
You know what, Hank?
I'm done with this!

35:33.680 --> 35:38.200
I'm done massaging your ego,
I'm done defending you to everyone!

35:38.200 --> 35:40.040
And I'm done supporting you!

35:40.080 --> 35:43.400
Supporting me?
You have been holding me back!

35:46.360 --> 35:47.760
Don't tempt me.

35:49.560 --> 35:51.360
Honoring the past,

35:51.360 --> 35:54.760
pledging your life to defend
the secrets of our land,

35:54.760 --> 35:57.640
protecting Wakanda
from the outside world.

35:57.640 --> 36:00.240
These are the sacred decrees
you have betrayed!

36:00.240 --> 36:01.800
The decrees are obsolete.

36:01.800 --> 36:04.600
Blindly adhering to them will only
lead to our downfall.

36:04.600 --> 36:07.800
Nakinda, as advisor to the royal family,

36:07.800 --> 36:10.720
do you wish to dispute these charges?

36:11.080 --> 36:13.200
No. I cannot.

36:13.560 --> 36:16.160
These western philosophies...

36:16.200 --> 36:18.520
were learnt beyond our borders.

36:18.520 --> 36:22.280
We warned your father
such ideals would corrupt you.

36:22.280 --> 36:26.240
- My father was a wise man.
- Who made an unwise decision.

36:26.240 --> 36:30.880
As such, we are forced to relieve you
of your royal authority.

36:30.880 --> 36:35.000
The elders hereby assume
the mantel of leadership.

36:57.120 --> 36:59.800
- Panther!
- Why have you returned?

36:59.920 --> 37:02.280
For that thing.
I want answers from it.

37:02.320 --> 37:04.680
I have tried.
It offers nothing.

37:05.440 --> 37:08.760
However, perhaps S.H.I.E.L. D
has more successful methods.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.720
We might, let us try.

37:12.720 --> 37:15.040
Agreed, but only if I go with you.

37:19.840 --> 37:23.000
General, the transport ship
is returning to Wakandans airspace.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.400
Patch me through to it.

37:30.840 --> 37:32.920
I arrive with news of the Chitaurii.

37:32.920 --> 37:35.400
You're a little late,
we already know about them.

37:35.400 --> 37:40.080
The real danger is not upon the ground,
but in the northern sky.

37:40.440 --> 37:42.400
Reposition the orbital scope.

38:00.840 --> 38:02.560
Have you lost your mind?

38:03.200 --> 38:05.480
We have to find out
what this thing knows.

38:05.520 --> 38:09.000
But by bringing it onboard,
you put all of us at risk!

38:09.000 --> 38:10.800
She's right, you know.

38:34.920 --> 38:36.600
Fire at this position!

39:04.400 --> 39:05.600
No!

39:20.160 --> 39:22.720
Alert the infirmary to expect wounded.

39:22.800 --> 39:24.000
I'll take her.

39:28.760 --> 39:33.000
- Stark, do you need a medic?
- Only if he moonlights as a mechanic.

39:33.360 --> 39:35.200
Just send Jarvis for me.

39:38.600 --> 39:42.440
General, the warship remains
in orbit above Africa.

39:42.600 --> 39:45.760
And now, some kind of energy field
is spreading out from it.

39:46.440 --> 39:48.760
How long before
it encompasses the planet?

39:49.560 --> 39:51.280
Within minutes, Sir.

40:04.600 --> 40:06.320
<i>Somewhere in the African continent,</i>

40:06.320 --> 40:09.040
<i>a translucent membrane</i>
now spreading across the sky,

40:09.080 --> 40:11.000
<i>dimming the light over the entire land.</i>

40:11.040 --> 40:13.800
<i>... apparently flowing from</i>
the enormous alien craft

40:13.800 --> 40:17.720
<i>that remains in a geosynchronous</i>
orbit, eye above Africa.

40:42.200 --> 40:45.480
You're quite correct, Sir.
A most alarming development.

40:45.440 --> 40:47.880
So much for Iron Man, version 6.7.

40:47.880 --> 40:50.320
Shall I prepare
a memorial service, Sir?

40:50.360 --> 40:52.640
Nice to see you
so broken up about it.

40:52.640 --> 40:54.480
It was my favorite model.

40:54.480 --> 40:57.320
They were all your favourites
at one time, Sir.

40:57.320 --> 41:00.200
True. Now let's pick up
my next favorite.

41:05.520 --> 41:09.560
I've always fancied the design and
colour scheme of the tailwind model.

41:09.560 --> 41:11.840
Nah, I believe
heavy equipment is in order.

41:13.160 --> 41:16.280
The War Machine,
sturdy, impervious...

41:16.280 --> 41:19.360
And handles like ten tons of tractor.

41:19.480 --> 41:21.920
Yeah, but it's got some sweet guns.

41:23.680 --> 41:24.960
Indeed, Sir.

41:32.520 --> 41:33.400
Bruce!

41:36.320 --> 41:38.920
I was told you had something
urgent to tell me.

41:47.360 --> 41:50.520
- There! You see?
- What?

41:50.560 --> 41:53.040
When the Hulk strikes
the Vibranium hull,

41:53.040 --> 41:54.920
it flashes, just before breaking.

41:55.800 --> 41:58.080
Are those the same areas
that became brittle?

42:01.760 --> 42:03.000
They are!

42:03.240 --> 42:04.440
What's its meaning?

42:04.440 --> 42:05.400
It's gamma!

42:05.400 --> 42:08.560
The Hulk radiates it. I think that's
what weakens the Vibranium.

42:10.360 --> 42:12.920
- That could be it!
- You need to run tests.

42:12.960 --> 42:13.800
How?

42:13.800 --> 42:16.040
There's a small gamma
generator in my lab.

42:16.040 --> 42:17.560
Betty, just get me out of here.

42:17.560 --> 42:20.480
I can't. Fury is the only one
with the release thumb.

42:20.520 --> 42:24.120
- And he doesn't...
- I know. He doesn't trust me.

42:47.080 --> 42:49.040
I'm going to make things right, Jan.

42:49.840 --> 42:51.240
I promise.

42:52.040 --> 42:55.440
I... I can't be the man
you wanted me to be.

42:57.440 --> 42:58.880
What are you doing here?

42:58.880 --> 42:59.880
I am sorry, Hank.

42:59.880 --> 43:02.800
Save it! You know, Jan thought
you were some kind of great hero.

43:02.800 --> 43:05.800
Well thanks, hero! Because of you,
she's in a coma.

43:05.960 --> 43:07.360
Look, I just wanted to...

43:07.360 --> 43:10.040
Get out of here,
before I throw you out!

43:14.680 --> 43:17.960
Move! Get inside!
Seek shelter! Quick!

44:22.480 --> 44:25.360
Stay here until we get
our final orders.

44:25.360 --> 44:26.800
Do you understand?

44:28.560 --> 44:32.440
Do you see now? We will never need
the help of outsiders.

44:32.440 --> 44:34.480
I do not share your confidence.

45:05.240 --> 45:09.080
<i>There is chaos in the streets,</i>
as immense mechanical creatures...

45:09.120 --> 45:11.520
<i>The sky is darkening</i>
over the city as we speak,

45:11.520 --> 45:13.800
<i>releasing an army of unstoppable</i>
machines to the ground.

45:13.800 --> 45:16.760
- General, Wakanda is contacting us.
- Put them through.

45:17.840 --> 45:21.440
General Fury, I am personally
requesting S.H.I.E.L.D.'s assistance.

45:21.440 --> 45:24.080
You and everyone else!
The whole world is under attack.

45:24.080 --> 45:27.160
Yes, but what the aliens are after
is here, in Wakanda.

45:27.880 --> 45:31.040
No more secrets, T'Challa.
What does Kleiser want?

45:31.040 --> 45:33.320
It is what you call Vibranium.

45:33.320 --> 45:35.320
- How much of it?
- A mountain.

45:35.480 --> 45:38.400
An ancient meteorite buried
beneath our land.

45:38.600 --> 45:41.480
And extending to depths
we cannot even imagine.

45:42.960 --> 45:45.080
It has given us protection.

45:45.080 --> 45:49.360
For in its unrefined state, we can
forge it into any weapon we choose.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.600
Without assistance, Wakanda will fall.

46:17.600 --> 46:19.360
And so will the rest of the world.

46:19.960 --> 46:23.520
You have betrayed your country
for the last time.

46:23.520 --> 46:27.440
If we do not get help, there will be
nothing left of our country.

46:52.640 --> 46:55.440
They're using our technology
to power their weapons!

46:55.440 --> 46:56.680
Destroy the ship!

47:27.080 --> 47:29.360
- I thought you were all dead.
- Not yet.

47:35.400 --> 47:36.440
Kill them!

47:51.400 --> 47:54.520
I have commanded you to end
your involvement, Thor!

47:54.560 --> 47:57.040
Humanity may have abandoned us, father,

47:57.040 --> 47:59.320
but I will not abandon them!

49:17.760 --> 49:20.560
Now, you die, for the last time.

49:20.600 --> 49:22.160
My words exactly!

49:44.360 --> 49:45.720
Oh no!

50:02.760 --> 50:04.080
It works!

50:47.520 --> 50:48.480
Come on!

50:59.720 --> 51:00.800
No!

51:14.560 --> 51:16.520
Don't kill me, please,
don't kill me!

51:18.240 --> 51:20.000
What? You want that opened?

51:20.600 --> 51:21.720
I can't!

51:23.040 --> 51:26.080
Wait! Wait!
I can kill him for you.

51:27.120 --> 51:28.720
What? No...

51:30.880 --> 51:32.400
No!

52:13.080 --> 52:14.040
Bruce!

52:20.280 --> 52:21.240
Bruce!

52:22.720 --> 52:25.920
That gamma generator...
It worked.

52:26.080 --> 52:29.240
- You were right!
- You have to get it to Fury.

52:29.240 --> 52:31.280
No! We have to get you
out of here!

52:31.280 --> 52:33.720
- It's too late for me.
- Don't say that!

52:33.960 --> 52:37.320
Just turn into the Hulk.
Smash your way out!

52:37.320 --> 52:38.680
I can't.

52:38.760 --> 52:40.720
I won't leave you like this!

52:41.160 --> 52:43.320
Betty, I am sorry...

52:43.640 --> 52:46.400
I am sorry for hurting you.

52:46.640 --> 52:47.960
I love you!

52:48.400 --> 52:50.280
I love you...

52:51.640 --> 52:52.720
Bruce!

52:56.960 --> 52:58.640
We have to go, Betty.

52:58.720 --> 53:01.000
We have to get to the hangar
and get out of here.

53:45.600 --> 53:48.640
This is Widow.
How far out are you?

53:48.920 --> 53:50.080
We'll be ready.

53:50.120 --> 53:51.120
Iron Man!

53:57.200 --> 53:59.000
Sorry for the delay, Natalia.

53:59.160 --> 54:00.600
Got it. On my way.

54:15.800 --> 54:18.360
Be patient! You are next.

54:45.080 --> 54:46.800
We need that distraction now.

54:48.320 --> 54:50.320
Warriors, attack!

54:53.560 --> 54:54.600
Fire!

54:57.720 --> 54:58.680
Fire!

55:06.440 --> 55:08.440
Again! Fire!

55:11.440 --> 55:12.400
Fire!

55:32.520 --> 55:33.960
Nice work, Betty.

55:34.960 --> 55:38.440
It's not the most stylish accessory,
but strap it on.

55:41.480 --> 55:42.440
Janet!

55:47.760 --> 55:49.000
Are you all right?

55:49.120 --> 55:50.640
I'm OK, Hank.

55:51.880 --> 55:54.440
Once you get into the ship,
find the center core.

55:54.440 --> 55:56.440
The Vibranium power source
should be there.

55:56.440 --> 55:58.280
Can you get through its defenses?

55:58.280 --> 56:01.560
Hey, piece of cake!
Except for that big canon.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Not a fan of the big canon.

56:04.600 --> 56:07.400
- Leave that one to me.
- It's all you, buddy!

56:07.400 --> 56:10.680
Hold on! You gonna need someone
watching your back inside that ship.

56:10.680 --> 56:12.280
Hank, what are you doing?

56:12.520 --> 56:15.280
Sorry, big guy,
I've got no room for a passenger.

56:15.240 --> 56:16.600
I know how to make room.

56:16.640 --> 56:18.880
No! Your body can't handle it.

56:18.880 --> 56:21.000
Shrinking now will tear you up inside.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.920
Honey, I'll be fine.
I need to do this.

56:35.720 --> 56:37.080
OK then.

56:37.320 --> 56:38.960
Hank, please.

56:39.000 --> 56:40.680
I told you I'd be fine.

56:40.680 --> 56:42.320
So stop babying me, huh?

56:48.040 --> 56:50.520
Nothing like flying first class!

56:59.520 --> 57:03.760
So, er... If Thor misses, can we
survive a hit form that canon?

57:03.840 --> 57:05.800
Let's just say you won't feel a thing.

57:06.360 --> 57:08.120
OK, we're going in!

57:19.560 --> 57:21.000
- Close your ears, Hank!
- What?

57:42.680 --> 57:44.280
So what are we hoping to find?

57:44.280 --> 57:45.480
The power core.

58:36.880 --> 58:38.880
- Can you make it?
- Yeah.

58:41.040 --> 58:45.360
Foolish boy. Do you think the power
of the Panther will serve you

58:45.360 --> 58:47.200
any better than it did you father?

58:47.280 --> 58:50.520
- You can't kill me.
- He's right.

58:51.920 --> 58:53.840
I don't have to kill him to stop him.

58:53.840 --> 58:55.680
I just need you to get him over there.

58:58.520 --> 58:59.360
OK.

58:59.360 --> 59:01.800
<i>Military efforts are failing</i>
while alien forces

59:01.800 --> 59:04.400
<i>continue driving the population</i>
to the center of New-York...

59:04.400 --> 59:06.160
They're coming from
the south and the east.

59:47.800 --> 59:49.640
We have to flood the chamber!

59:55.920 --> 59:58.880
It's not enough!
Break off the nozzles!

01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:20.240
We're close.

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:24.440
With these energy readings,
the core must be enormous.

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.120
You mean like that thing?

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:27.280
Exactly.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:37.360
What are you doing?

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:41.000
I'll be all right! Go!
I'll hold them off!

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.000
No! No!

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:52.720
Hank! Wake up!

01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.120
Hank!

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.280
I got you, buddy.

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:31.880
Hank! Hank!

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:33.840
No!

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:41.160
See? I told...
I told you I could be...

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:43.400
the man you always...
wanted me to be.

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:45.840
You are, Hank. You are.

01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:57.400
It's going to hit the city!

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:05.160
- I think I can deflect it.
- But can you survive that?

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:07.560
If not, I'll take
that posthumous award.

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:18.800
<i>Warning: Fuel cell at 2% and falling.</i><i></i>

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Divert power from life support.

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:30.800
<i>Total system failure in:</i>
3... 2... 1...

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:49.720
No! No... not another one.

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:24.720
You really are a god.

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:27.680
Your Highness.

01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:35.400
What shall we do with Kleiser?

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:36.760
Bury him.

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:39.480
It's over.

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:17.320
Betty...

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:36.200
At least he's still out there, Betty.

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:45.000
Hey!

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:27.680
Steve. Things have been strained
between us lately, and I...

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:33.880
That's in the past. I think we should
start focusing on our future.

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:45.640
Come on, Goldy Locks!
I'll buy you a pint of mead.

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:51.240
It's not every day we save the world.

01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:59.400
Actually, General, I have saved
Midgaard on several occasions.

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:02.640
Did you not hear of my victory
over the fire demon Sirta?

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:05.160
They speak of it still
in the halls of Valhalla.
