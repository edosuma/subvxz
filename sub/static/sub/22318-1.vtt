00:40.792 --> 00:41.962
- Back
at the seaview resort

00:42.000 --> 00:43.670
for shoprite lpga classic,

00:43.708 --> 00:46.708
just outside Atlantic city,
Galloway township, New Jersey

00:46.750 --> 00:49.580
where we have a beauty
on our hands right now.

00:49.625 --> 00:51.875
Zoe papadopoulos
trying to break back

00:51.917 --> 00:54.667
into that winner's circle
for a very promising career

00:54.708 --> 00:56.788
that has gone a little
wayward of late,

00:56.833 --> 00:59.333
trying to hold off,
or actually catch in this case

00:59.375 --> 01:03.375
Nicole castrale, a prolific
winner on the lpga tour.

01:03.417 --> 01:04.667
It's not a tough putt.

01:04.708 --> 01:06.208
She's got a lot out
of her game today

01:06.250 --> 01:07.500
and made plenty of putts

01:07.542 --> 01:10.252
on these inconsistent
Greens at times,

01:10.292 --> 01:12.542
but this is a big
one here, final hole.

01:12.583 --> 01:15.133
For the win, did she hit it?

01:16.417 --> 01:17.827
Oh, but she left it just short.

01:19.417 --> 01:22.787
That's a certain par,
tap-in for Nicole castrale.

01:22.833 --> 01:26.793
Now, all the pressure switches
back to Zoe papadopoulos.

01:35.542 --> 01:39.382
She now has three feet
to force a playoff

01:39.417 --> 01:42.917
and we'll see if she can get
those nerves under control.

01:43.708 --> 01:45.378
Trying to settle herself down.

01:45.417 --> 01:47.077
It's just a routine putt,
it's only three feet,

01:47.125 --> 01:48.785
it's straight uphill.

01:50.042 --> 01:52.042
She could make it
with her eyes closed.

01:53.542 --> 01:55.332
Not a word being spoken.

01:55.375 --> 01:57.625
You could hear a pin
drop in the gallery.

02:01.083 --> 02:02.833
Oh, hit the lip again.

02:05.583 --> 02:07.083
Oh my word.

02:07.125 --> 02:07.875
- Damn.

02:09.792 --> 02:11.462
- She just
buried the putter in the green,

02:11.500 --> 02:13.540
that's an unforgivable
sin for golfers

02:13.583 --> 02:16.713
and the worst display of
sportsmanship I have ever seen.

02:16.750 --> 02:18.630
This is a complete meltdown.

02:19.750 --> 02:21.000
No, burying that
putter in the green

02:21.042 --> 02:25.082
is almost a certain suspension
for a very long time.

03:36.875 --> 03:38.125
- Okay.

03:45.208 --> 03:46.828
Not so fast.

03:46.958 --> 03:49.208
- Where are you going?

03:49.708 --> 03:52.708
- Okay.
- Thank you.

04:21.458 --> 04:22.788
- Calling to drop me, Derek?

04:22.833 --> 04:26.173
- Drop, no, why,
because of the thing?

04:26.208 --> 04:28.128
- Yes, Derek, because of
the humiliating myself

04:28.167 --> 04:30.707
and ruining my
career thing, Jesus.

04:30.750 --> 04:33.040
- Everybody wants
you, everybody.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.210
- What are you talking about?

04:35.250 --> 04:38.960
- ESPN, gma, Jimmy
fallon, Jimmy kimmel,

04:39.000 --> 04:40.830
Kelly meyers, the list goes on.

04:40.875 --> 04:43.455
That little meltdown
you had, it went viral.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.250
Everybody wants a
piece of you, honey.

04:45.292 --> 04:46.882
- No, no way.

04:46.917 --> 04:49.877
- No, no way, everybody thinks
you went a little crazy.

04:49.917 --> 04:51.287
I try to keep a little low,

04:51.333 --> 04:53.133
but if you go on these shows

04:53.167 --> 04:55.457
and show you a little humility
and a little contrition--

04:55.500 --> 04:57.330
- don't use words
you don't understand.

04:57.375 --> 05:00.035
- Hey, hey, doll
face, it's my job

05:00.083 --> 05:02.793
to turn this into
a positive, okay?

05:02.833 --> 05:03.963
Go home, have a dr--

05:59.708 --> 06:01.208
- this is good here.

06:38.625 --> 06:40.915
Holy mother of god!

06:41.000 --> 06:42.460
Zoe!

06:48.875 --> 06:50.455
You give a heart attack, Zoe.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.380
I didn't know it was you.

06:52.417 --> 06:53.497
- I'm sorry, yiayia

06:53.542 --> 06:56.582
- who is it?
- Your granddaughter!

06:56.792 --> 07:00.422
- How did you get here,
why didn't you call?

07:00.917 --> 07:02.827
- Hi, pappous.

07:03.917 --> 07:05.537
My love!

07:06.208 --> 07:07.038
- How did you get here?

07:07.083 --> 07:08.383
Why didn't you call?

07:08.417 --> 07:09.747
I would have come
to the airport.

07:09.792 --> 07:11.542
I asked her this already.

07:11.583 --> 07:13.133
- I know, I know, I'm sorry.

07:13.167 --> 07:14.577
It was just a spur of
the moment decision.

07:14.625 --> 07:17.705
I just really wanted
to see you guys.

07:19.125 --> 07:21.825
This place hasn't
changed at all.

07:22.167 --> 07:24.877
That's because someone
doesn't fix what he's asked to fix.

07:25.250 --> 07:27.630
I work all day long, woman.

07:27.708 --> 07:30.538
-All day long with the newspaper.
- Whatever.

07:30.750 --> 07:34.920
- But where is the boyfriend
you wrote us about, Zoe?

07:35.958 --> 07:37.878
- He's not in the
picture anymore.

07:37.917 --> 07:40.327
- Why, what did the bastard do?

07:41.083 --> 07:43.963
Take Zoe's things to her room,
this is none of your business.

07:44.042 --> 07:45.712
That's what I'm doing.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.213
- Oh, no, it's okay,
pappous, I got it.

07:47.250 --> 07:48.170
- It's okay.

07:53.375 --> 07:56.165
I have to fix these steps.
Someone might kill himself.

07:56.292 --> 07:57.582
Watch your step.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.500
Come on.

08:07.542 --> 08:10.792
Unpack and we'll eat
when you're ready.

08:12.875 --> 08:15.075
Very good, pappou.
I'll be there.

09:34.042 --> 09:35.632
Good morning.

09:35.750 --> 09:36.790
Good morning!

09:36.833 --> 09:39.133
- We were going to
send for the doctor.

09:39.208 --> 09:40.788
Oil the tray.

09:40.833 --> 09:43.383
- I'm sorry, is
there any coffee?

09:43.417 --> 09:44.627
- Coffee.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.375
- It smells amazing in here.

09:46.417 --> 09:47.827
It's the sugar cookies.

09:47.875 --> 09:49.285
- You must eat something.

09:49.333 --> 09:51.383
Athletes need energy.

09:51.417 --> 09:52.247
- Athletes.

09:52.292 --> 09:53.882
What are you grumbling about,
old man?

09:53.917 --> 09:56.377
- Now, I know you never
wanted to believe it, pappous,

09:56.417 --> 09:58.167
but golf is a sport.

10:00.333 --> 10:03.133
- We have missed our little Zoe.

10:03.167 --> 10:07.037
It was been too many years
since your last visit.

10:07.083 --> 10:10.213
I hope you can have a long
stay with us this time.

10:10.250 --> 10:14.080
- Oh, I can stay a week,
10 days at the most.

10:15.750 --> 10:18.380
A week? What kind of visit is this?

10:18.625 --> 10:20.165
Stop it.

10:20.417 --> 10:23.167
- What your pappous means
is it's wonderful to see you

10:23.208 --> 10:27.288
and we will enjoy whatever
time we have together.

11:34.167 --> 11:35.497
- Hey!

11:36.125 --> 11:37.205
Hey!

12:17.083 --> 12:19.253
You need to be more safer.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.330
Golf is played in a green grass.

12:24.583 --> 12:27.673
Not the sea where you can
make people dead.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.502
Hello?
You speak Greek?

12:32.542 --> 12:35.082
- I do, but I think you don't.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.500
- Why aren't you
playing on a golf course

12:38.542 --> 12:39.962
like a normal person?

12:40.000 --> 12:41.960
- I'm not allowed to play there.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.500
- Probably 'cause
you're a hazard.

12:43.542 --> 12:45.502
- No, I know how to play,

12:45.542 --> 12:47.332
better than anyone
in this village.

12:47.375 --> 12:49.875
- Oh, really, and who
taught you the game?

12:55.417 --> 12:57.667
You know, you really
should be using a wedge.

13:02.250 --> 13:03.040
Me?

13:12.792 --> 13:14.252
A skip shot.

13:14.292 --> 13:15.382
Watch.

13:56.875 --> 13:58.035
- Father.

13:58.083 --> 13:59.583
Katarina.

13:59.625 --> 14:01.325
- Excuse me, Marcos, a moment.

14:01.792 --> 14:04.792
- You remember my famous
granddaughter from America?

14:04.833 --> 14:06.423
- Of course I do.

14:06.458 --> 14:08.828
- We have been following
your career somewhat, Zoe,

14:08.875 --> 14:10.285
nice to meet you.

14:10.333 --> 14:11.833
- Nice to meet you, too.

14:11.875 --> 14:15.325
- Zoe, father Anthony
also knows the golf.

14:15.375 --> 14:16.575
- Hardly.

14:16.625 --> 14:18.325
I spent some time in America

14:18.375 --> 14:21.035
and some of my friends
there are big golfers,

14:21.083 --> 14:23.213
not pros like you, of course.

14:23.250 --> 14:27.130
- Zoe is on her way to play
a pro tournament in Dubai.

14:27.167 --> 14:31.247
- So, your suspension was a
short one, that is a good news.

14:31.292 --> 14:32.672
- Suspension?

14:32.708 --> 14:34.708
Tell me of this suspension.

14:35.625 --> 14:38.415
- I meant to tell you about
all of this earlier, yia yia.

14:38.458 --> 14:42.248
I'm really sorry, I needed
to clear my head first.

14:42.292 --> 14:44.002
- Clear your head of
what, what trouble?

14:44.042 --> 14:45.582
- What is going on?

14:45.625 --> 14:47.035
-Zoe was suspended.

14:50.125 --> 14:52.705
- Okay, how do i
say this in Greek?

14:53.500 --> 14:54.500
Um..

14:55.000 --> 14:57.210
I lose game.

14:57.292 --> 14:58.672
I go crazy.

14:58.750 --> 14:59.750
Um...

15:00.208 --> 15:02.538
Then I make myself the ass.

15:04.292 --> 15:07.832
I wanted to see my family...

15:07.917 --> 15:11.627
...because I feel too bad.

15:11.708 --> 15:14.828
Sit down, sit down.

15:15.375 --> 15:17.575
- It's okay, Zoe, it's okay.

15:17.625 --> 15:21.205
Don't worry about this
golf, it is nothing.

15:21.250 --> 15:24.170
No, no, golf is very important for Zoe.

15:24.250 --> 15:27.000
We want to hear, tell us.

15:27.417 --> 15:31.167
- I could sum it all up in
one sentence, I have the yips.

15:31.625 --> 15:33.125
- Yips?

15:33.958 --> 15:35.328
- What are yips?

15:37.042 --> 15:38.632
- It's a kind of golf curse.

15:38.667 --> 15:42.037
It means I can't putt,
if I can't putt, I can't play,

15:42.292 --> 15:44.252
there's no more tour for me.

15:46.125 --> 15:48.535
- Well, maybe the
time for golf is over,

15:48.583 --> 15:50.423
maybe it's time
for something new.

15:51.042 --> 15:53.672
- What your pappous
means is we want you

15:53.708 --> 15:56.418
to stay here as
long as you like.

15:56.458 --> 15:59.668
We have golf course
here, you 'member?

15:59.708 --> 16:00.918
- How can I forget?

16:01.083 --> 16:03.583
It's the first place dad
ever took me to play.

16:04.125 --> 16:05.745
I haven't been there is so long.

16:05.792 --> 16:07.712
- Yeah, you don't wanna
go there, trust me.

16:07.750 --> 16:11.540
It is owned by a rude American
and run by a Greek idiot.

16:11.583 --> 16:14.253
- What does it matter,
it's still a proper golf course

16:14.292 --> 16:16.582
where Zoe can practice her yips.

16:16.667 --> 16:18.167
Eh? Eh?

16:23.625 --> 16:26.575
- Well, this is quite
a golf course, panos.

16:26.625 --> 16:28.325
- I'm glad to hear it, sir.

16:28.792 --> 16:31.382
- Kinda like playing
in your own backyard.

16:31.417 --> 16:33.377
Got the whole place to yourself.

16:33.958 --> 16:35.998
- Privacy is very important, sir

16:36.042 --> 16:37.712
- you know what it
reminds me of, panos?

16:37.750 --> 16:40.040
Peeing in a dark suit.

16:40.292 --> 16:42.752
You get this warm feeling,
but nobody notices.

16:42.792 --> 16:44.042
- Yes.

16:44.083 --> 16:45.253
- You see, I didn't
pay a small fortune

16:45.292 --> 16:46.792
to have my own
private golf course.

16:46.833 --> 16:49.253
I bought this thing because
i wanted to make some money.

16:49.292 --> 16:51.462
- Yes, yes, making money
is very important, sir.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.290
- Will you explain to me how
I'm suppose to make some money

16:53.333 --> 16:55.633
when there's not one
blessed golfer out here?

16:57.000 --> 16:58.210
Oh my god.

16:59.250 --> 17:01.420
Are those sheep, really?

17:06.000 --> 17:07.750
I've got big plans
for this panayiotis

17:07.791 --> 17:09.791
and if you wanna be involved,

17:09.833 --> 17:10.833
then you get this house in order

17:10.875 --> 17:12.285
and you turn this ship around.

17:12.333 --> 17:13.713
- I'm really sorry, sir.

17:13.750 --> 17:16.829
I just didn't know when you
want to begun the renovation,

17:16.875 --> 17:18.665
but now I know it and
from tomorrow morning,

17:18.708 --> 17:20.417
I will start
renovate everything.

17:20.458 --> 17:22.377
We can hire a golf
professional or--

17:22.416 --> 17:23.416
- do I look like
the guy who gives

17:23.458 --> 17:25.288
a rat's ass how you do it?

17:25.541 --> 17:26.832
Next time I come back here,

17:26.875 --> 17:29.245
I wanna see this place
filled with paying golfers.

17:30.125 --> 17:31.455
- Excuse me, sir.

17:31.500 --> 17:33.710
- Don't make me sorry
i hired you panayiotis.

17:33.750 --> 17:36.790
- I apologize, everything
will be better, I promise.

17:44.542 --> 17:46.332
Why did you bring the sheep here!

17:46.375 --> 17:48.125
You're killing me!

17:48.208 --> 17:52.628
What do you want? Money?
Always money?

17:52.708 --> 17:54.878
Oh! Come on!
How did you get in here?

18:09.292 --> 18:11.252
Thank you.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.210
- How did you do it?

18:16.583 --> 18:18.383
- Oh, hello, again.

18:18.417 --> 18:21.997
- Father Anthony said you're
professional golfer from lpga.

18:22.042 --> 18:23.332
Is it true?

18:23.375 --> 18:25.125
- This is true.

18:25.167 --> 18:27.377
My name is Zoe papadopoulos.

18:27.417 --> 18:28.627
- I'm Stella.

18:28.667 --> 18:30.747
- Well, nice to
meet you, Stella.

18:30.792 --> 18:32.792
Now, how did I do what exactly?

18:32.833 --> 18:36.753
- Hit the shot the other day,
i want to know how you did it.

18:36.792 --> 18:38.672
- Well, that's a tough question.

18:38.708 --> 18:40.078
I mean, you never quite know

18:40.125 --> 18:42.325
how good a shot's
gonna be, do you?

18:42.375 --> 18:43.625
You can do all the preparation

18:43.667 --> 18:47.127
and line everything up
just right and poof,

18:47.167 --> 18:49.787
you get a fat shot into
the rough, you know?

18:50.583 --> 18:52.003
Or, practice.

18:52.167 --> 18:56.537
- I practice everyday,
but it's hard to come perfect

18:56.583 --> 18:58.543
because I don't have
a course to use.

18:59.208 --> 19:02.128
- Oh, right, you said
you weren't allowed?

19:02.167 --> 19:03.457
It can't be because you're young

19:03.500 --> 19:05.500
'cause I was about your
age and I played there.

19:05.750 --> 19:08.290
- No, you have to pay a lot
of money if you wanna play.

19:08.333 --> 19:09.583
- But what about clinics?

19:09.625 --> 19:11.125
Don't they have free
golf lessons for kids?

19:11.167 --> 19:12.167
Mmm-mm.

19:17.208 --> 19:21.328
- This book is in Greek,
but you don't speak Greek.

19:22.417 --> 19:24.377
- So you keep reminding me.

19:24.750 --> 19:27.080
I used to speak and
read it pretty well.

19:27.125 --> 19:28.915
I spent many summers
here growing up,

19:28.958 --> 19:32.748
but now my Greek is you know,

19:33.375 --> 19:36.035
I think I've managed to get
through two whole pages.

19:36.542 --> 19:39.212
- Okay, I'll help
you with your Greek

19:39.250 --> 19:42.790
and in exchange, you will
give me golf lessons.

19:42.833 --> 19:45.333
- Oh, Stella, I'm sorry,
but like you said,

19:45.375 --> 19:46.995
we don't have a
course to play on

19:47.042 --> 19:50.132
and I'm afraid I'm not gonna
be here much longer anyway.

19:54.417 --> 19:56.377
You know what I could do,

19:56.417 --> 19:59.327
I could work with
you on your swing,

19:59.375 --> 20:01.245
we don't need a course for that.

20:11.833 --> 20:12.963
- Hello, miss.

20:13.833 --> 20:14.583
Hello.

20:14.625 --> 20:15.415
- Hello.

20:15.458 --> 20:17.248
- Hello, hi.

20:17.833 --> 20:21.253
Hi, my name is panayiotis
manalakis, people call me panos.

20:21.292 --> 20:23.882
I'm the manager of
colossus golf course.

20:23.917 --> 20:25.377
You're Zoe papadopoulos, right?

20:25.417 --> 20:26.287
- Right.

20:26.333 --> 20:27.503
- Well, it's a great honor

20:27.542 --> 20:29.672
to meet a golf superstar
such as yourself.

20:29.708 --> 20:31.128
- Whoa, easy there.

20:31.167 --> 20:33.037
- I have a proposal for you.

20:34.542 --> 20:38.172
I want to invite you to run
a golf clinic for the summer.

20:38.208 --> 20:39.538
- Oh, I'm not gonna be here--

20:39.583 --> 20:40.923
- okay, you're a big star

20:40.958 --> 20:44.128
and we can use your
expertise, but...

20:44.583 --> 20:48.043
I hear also you have
putting problems, right?

20:49.458 --> 20:50.748
- It's nothing I can't manage.

20:50.792 --> 20:52.712
- Listen, listen, if you
come work at the course,

20:52.750 --> 20:55.290
you will be able to practice
your game without pressure

20:56.000 --> 20:58.710
and then when your
suspension is over,

20:58.750 --> 21:01.420
you can return to the
tour better than ever.

21:01.458 --> 21:04.078
You see, good for me
and good for you.

21:09.292 --> 21:10.502
- Look.

21:10.542 --> 21:13.422
I appreciate the offer,
but no, thank you.

21:13.458 --> 21:17.668
- Listen, we have great
plans for this place, listen.

21:17.708 --> 21:20.168
Just come and visit the course.

21:20.208 --> 21:21.668
You may change your mind.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.125
Mmm.

21:44.667 --> 21:45.667
- Zoe.

21:46.125 --> 21:47.165
- Yeah?

21:47.208 --> 21:49.458
- What is a matter with you?

21:49.625 --> 21:51.575
Are you making down again?

21:54.042 --> 21:55.132
- Yia yia.

21:55.750 --> 22:00.290
Yiayia, this galaktoboureko
make me dying of the happiness.

22:03.125 --> 22:06.825
We used to make it together
when you were young, remember?

22:08.333 --> 22:09.713
I do.

22:10.917 --> 22:14.497
I remember the entire
kitchen smelling like sugar

22:14.917 --> 22:17.167
and everything in the
world just seemed right.

22:17.208 --> 22:18.748
- Yes.

22:18.792 --> 22:21.002
- That's why I married her,
her cooking tricked me.

22:24.083 --> 22:27.673
- Hey, do you guys know a little
girl in town named Stella?

22:27.708 --> 22:32.168
Cute girl, maybe 10 or
11, extremely serious.

22:32.417 --> 22:35.077
Could it be Stella roussos,
Marcos' daughter?

22:35.458 --> 22:38.328
- Ah, Marcos russos,
yes, the widower.

22:38.375 --> 22:41.035
- He and his daughter live
near the prophet ilias,

22:41.083 --> 22:42.133
why do you ask?

22:42.167 --> 22:43.997
- Well, I've seen her
at the beach a few times

22:44.042 --> 22:46.542
and she says she's
teaching herself golf.

22:47.250 --> 22:49.380
- I thought she
was a bright girl.

22:49.417 --> 22:50.627
- Pappous.

22:55.125 --> 22:58.205
So, where exactly do they live?

23:32.792 --> 23:34.082
Hello?

23:36.792 --> 23:38.002
Hi.

23:38.375 --> 23:42.035
Stella lives this house?

23:42.208 --> 23:45.918
My yiayia says true but don't know.

23:46.375 --> 23:48.915
- Yes, you definitely
don't know.

23:48.958 --> 23:50.458
- Thank god you speak English,

23:50.500 --> 23:52.170
I'm not even sure
what I just said.

23:52.208 --> 23:54.378
- What matters is that
you're in the right place.

23:54.417 --> 23:55.957
- Oh, good.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.290
- You are Zoe papadopoulos
the famous professional golfer

23:58.333 --> 24:00.133
and my daughter's new hero.

24:00.167 --> 24:01.917
I'm Marcos russos, pleasure.

24:01.958 --> 24:03.078
- It's nice to meet you.

24:03.125 --> 24:04.825
I keep running into your Stella,

24:04.875 --> 24:06.245
so I just thought
i should come over

24:06.292 --> 24:08.382
and properly introduce myself.

24:08.417 --> 24:09.997
- Well, thank you.

24:10.042 --> 24:12.712
Well, she tells me she
will be teaching you Greek.

24:12.750 --> 24:14.040
- Yes.

24:14.083 --> 24:16.633
- From what I can tell
it's a great idea.

24:16.667 --> 24:19.497
- I know, it's so embarrassing.

24:19.542 --> 24:20.502
- Look who's here.

24:20.542 --> 24:21.292
- Oh, hi, Stella.

24:21.333 --> 24:22.883
- Hello.

24:22.917 --> 24:24.377
- She tells me you have
the most perfect golf swing

24:24.417 --> 24:25.667
she's ever seen.

24:25.708 --> 24:27.828
- Oh, wow, I don't
know about that,

24:27.875 --> 24:29.995
but thank you,
I'm very flattered.

24:30.042 --> 24:32.632
You know, she's quite the
little golfer herself.

24:33.417 --> 24:34.747
- You wanna come in?

24:34.792 --> 24:36.462
- Okay, thank you.

24:40.042 --> 24:41.962
I can't believe I'm eating
another piece of this,

24:42.000 --> 24:43.790
it's obscene.

24:43.833 --> 24:45.253
- So, you
were born in America?

24:45.292 --> 24:47.752
- Chicago, but my
father's from here.

24:47.792 --> 24:50.922
We used to come here and visit
my grandparents every summer.

24:50.958 --> 24:52.668
Actually, the first time
i picked up a golf club

24:52.708 --> 24:53.628
was here at colossus.

24:53.667 --> 24:54.417
- Oh, yes?

24:55.833 --> 24:58.043
And how long are you
staying this time?

24:58.083 --> 25:00.333
- Long enough to help
me with my drive, baba.

25:00.375 --> 25:02.665
We have a lesson
set for tomorrow.

25:02.708 --> 25:03.918
- Really?

25:03.958 --> 25:06.418
- Yes, well, your
daughter is very focused

25:06.458 --> 25:08.128
and very persuasive.

25:08.167 --> 25:10.247
- Yeah, that she is.

25:10.292 --> 25:11.832
Okay, love...

25:11.917 --> 25:15.207
...say goodnight to miss papadopoulos
and go finish your homework.

25:15.917 --> 25:19.537
Goodnight, Zoe.
Thank you for the dessert.

25:20.125 --> 25:22.665
- You're so welcome,
I'll see you tomorrow.

25:22.708 --> 25:23.708
Goodnight.

25:27.083 --> 25:28.503
- I feel I should thank you.

25:28.542 --> 25:30.172
- Well, I'll pass it
on to my grandmother.

25:30.208 --> 25:32.418
I can't take credit
for her galaktoboureko.

25:32.458 --> 25:33.878
- No, no, I wanna thank you

25:33.917 --> 25:35.877
for your kindness
towards my daughter.

25:35.917 --> 25:37.247
- Well, it's my pleasure.

25:37.292 --> 25:39.502
She's a very bright
and dedicated girl.

25:39.542 --> 25:40.882
- I just don't want you to feel

25:40.917 --> 25:42.667
that you have to spend
all of your time with her.

25:42.708 --> 25:44.168
You're here visiting
your family.

25:44.208 --> 25:47.038
- No, no, don't worry, it's
just hitting a few golf balls.

25:47.208 --> 25:48.458
It'll be fun.

25:49.458 --> 25:50.998
- Relax.

25:51.042 --> 25:53.042
Come on, let's try again.

25:53.417 --> 25:54.327
- Are you sure you
wanna keep playing

25:54.375 --> 25:55.575
with just this one club?

25:55.625 --> 25:58.495
- I have no choice, it's
the only one I have.

25:58.542 --> 26:00.502
- Really, where did
you get it from anyway?

26:00.542 --> 26:03.632
- Some tourist boy
left it behind.

26:04.375 --> 26:05.955
- I don't know, Stella.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.080
I mean, you really need
a course to play on

26:08.125 --> 26:09.375
and a full set of clubs.

26:09.417 --> 26:11.127
I mean, this cliff
and that five iron

26:11.167 --> 26:12.827
are only gonna take you so far.

26:12.875 --> 26:14.325
- I told you--

26:14.375 --> 26:16.535
- I know, I know, but listen,

26:16.583 --> 26:20.173
if you truly wanna learn, you
have to believe there's a way.

26:21.833 --> 26:23.793
Never give up, okay.

26:23.833 --> 26:25.293
Now, I can't promise anything,

26:25.333 --> 26:28.213
but I think i
might have an idea.

26:35.292 --> 26:36.252
- Thomas.

26:37.208 --> 26:38.538
Thomas.

26:38.583 --> 26:39.793
- Where's the fire?

26:39.833 --> 26:42.333
- I'm not paying
you to read, okay?

26:42.375 --> 26:45.825
- I hardly notice you were
paying me at all to be honest.

26:45.875 --> 26:48.875
- You're very lucky to
have a job, we are lucky.

26:48.917 --> 26:51.247
So, you're gonna clean this up

26:51.292 --> 26:53.332
and to have discussion
for improvements,

26:53.375 --> 26:55.785
Henderson wants this
place filled with golfers.

26:55.833 --> 26:58.633
- This place, this place
filled with golfers?

26:58.667 --> 27:00.327
Oh, it's a crazy dream.

27:00.375 --> 27:01.705
- It's not a joke.

27:01.750 --> 27:05.330
We have two months to start
showing a profit, okay?

27:05.375 --> 27:07.205
Otherwise we're out of business.

27:07.250 --> 27:09.540
- Okay, I'll get right on it.

27:16.042 --> 27:16.962
- Hi.

27:17.167 --> 27:20.327
- Oh, hello, you must be lost.

27:25.167 --> 27:26.787
- Ms. papadopoulos, welcome.

27:26.833 --> 27:29.003
I'm so happy to see you again.

27:29.042 --> 27:31.332
Ms. papadopoulos is
a professional golfer

27:31.375 --> 27:32.625
from the United States.

27:32.667 --> 27:35.957
- Oh, the cavalry come
to save us, good luck.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.830
- And Thomas is our greenskeeper

27:37.875 --> 27:39.415
and have a lot of work to do.

27:39.458 --> 27:40.328
Go, Thomas.

27:41.708 --> 27:42.998
So, when can we start?

27:43.042 --> 27:45.422
- Oh, wait, hold on,
not so fast, I have--

27:46.375 --> 27:47.495
- excuse me, it's Henderson

27:47.542 --> 27:49.332
and give Ms. papadopoulos a tour

27:49.375 --> 27:51.955
and I'll be right
back, I'm sorry.

27:54.667 --> 27:57.957
- So, you wanna have a look
around our little sinking ship?

27:58.000 --> 28:00.380
- Oh, Mr. Henderson.

28:00.417 --> 28:04.247
How nice to hear from
you this fine day.

28:04.292 --> 28:05.792
- How about we cut
the crap, pano?

28:05.833 --> 28:07.293
Are things shaping up out there?

28:07.333 --> 28:10.793
- Of course, sir, I've
just hired a golf pro.

28:10.833 --> 28:12.883
- What's his name?

28:12.917 --> 28:14.037
- His name, sir?

28:14.083 --> 28:16.963
- Yeah, tough question,
what's his name?

28:17.000 --> 28:18.080
- His name is

28:20.208 --> 28:23.628
car, Carter, Zach
Carter, yes, Zach Carter.

28:23.667 --> 28:24.917
- Where did you find him?

28:24.958 --> 28:27.038
- Well, this is a
very interesting

28:27.083 --> 28:29.213
and complicated story, sir.

28:29.250 --> 28:31.830
- Well, how about you give
me the three second version?

28:31.875 --> 28:33.075
- Yes, of course, sir.

28:33.125 --> 28:35.455
He was working in
Elle's club in Dubai

28:35.500 --> 28:38.210
and he needed a
change of scenery,

28:38.250 --> 28:40.380
so I hired him immediately.

28:40.417 --> 28:44.957
- Excellent, excellent,
but you know what, pano?

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
I just decided I'm
not gonna fire you.

28:47.042 --> 28:48.332
- Oh, thank you very
much, Mr. Henderson,

28:48.375 --> 28:50.575
thank you, really,
very much, thank you.

28:50.625 --> 28:52.375
- I'm all in.

28:52.417 --> 28:54.457
- You are all in.

28:57.417 --> 29:00.417
- The course looks
a little different than I remember it.

29:01.333 --> 29:03.383
- How do
you remember it?

29:03.958 --> 29:05.378
- Beautiful, no?

29:05.417 --> 29:08.287
- Well, you certainly
can't beat the views.

29:08.583 --> 29:10.753
On the other hand, that
clubhouse could maybe use

29:10.792 --> 29:11.962
a fresh coat of paint.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.540
- Fresh coat of paint?

29:13.583 --> 29:16.173
Yeah, well, that is viewing
the glass half full.

29:16.625 --> 29:20.205
- So, have you thought
about my offer?

29:20.250 --> 29:21.420
- I have, yes.

29:21.458 --> 29:22.208
- And?

29:22.250 --> 29:23.460
- I'm interested.

29:23.500 --> 29:24.250
- You are?

29:24.292 --> 29:25.632
- If we can make a deal.

29:25.667 --> 29:26.997
- What did you have in mind?

29:27.042 --> 29:28.542
- A few things.

29:28.583 --> 29:31.253
I'm free to go whenever I want,
no contract, no commitments.

29:31.292 --> 29:32.422
- Deal.

29:32.458 --> 29:33.918
- I can use the course
whenever I want.

29:33.958 --> 29:34.708
- Deal.

29:34.750 --> 29:36.670
- I run all the
clinics by my own rules

29:36.708 --> 29:38.328
and I take a 10% commission.

29:38.375 --> 29:39.165
- Deal.

29:39.208 --> 29:39.958
- But.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.130
- Always there's a but.

29:41.167 --> 29:42.787
- None of the
villagers have to pay.

29:42.833 --> 29:43.883
- Well, what?

29:43.917 --> 29:45.417
- Look, you can charge tourists

29:45.458 --> 29:47.208
and out-of-towners anything
you want, I don't care,

29:47.250 --> 29:49.250
but locals play for free.

29:49.667 --> 29:52.577
- I'm afraid that's
impossible, Ms. papadopoulos.

29:52.625 --> 29:55.575
- Well, I'm afraid it's
non-negotiable, Mr. malakis.

29:55.625 --> 29:57.745
I mean, Mr. manalakis.

29:57.792 --> 29:59.382
- Pano, pano, what
are you worried about?

29:59.417 --> 30:01.997
Come on, the villagers
hardly ever play golf anyway,

30:02.042 --> 30:03.752
even when the town
owned the course.

30:03.792 --> 30:05.292
I mean, I'm sure they'd be happy

30:05.333 --> 30:07.753
to live out the rest of their
days never playing golf.

30:07.792 --> 30:10.462
- Don't worry, I can bring
you some paying customers.

30:10.500 --> 30:12.380
It's just not gonna
be the locals.

30:13.083 --> 30:14.173
Deal?

30:22.292 --> 30:24.002
Good morning!

30:24.083 --> 30:25.333
Good morning!

30:25.708 --> 30:27.168
I thought I'd be
up before you guys.

30:27.208 --> 30:29.038
- This is nothing
to wish for, Zoe,

30:29.083 --> 30:32.883
the earlier you riser, that
means the older you are.

30:32.917 --> 30:34.167
It's a fact.

30:34.208 --> 30:35.788
- You want to help
us with the bread?

30:35.833 --> 30:36.883
- Absolutely.

30:38.542 --> 30:39.832
But you're gonna have
to remind me what to do.

30:39.875 --> 30:41.165
It's been a while.

30:41.208 --> 30:43.078
- You never forget
how to make bread.

30:43.125 --> 30:44.955
It's like riding a bicycle.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.830
Just throw your hands
in, there's no wrong way.

30:48.875 --> 30:49.785
- Okay.

30:57.542 --> 30:59.502
You guys must have
hands of steel.

31:01.125 --> 31:05.745
You have to use your
whole body and you won't get tired.

31:06.208 --> 31:08.708
- It is supposed to be an
"agonas" Zoe,

31:08.750 --> 31:11.080
you know "agonas" struggle.

31:11.792 --> 31:13.922
The dough is like life you see,

31:13.958 --> 31:15.958
you give it everything you have

31:16.000 --> 31:20.380
and after you've done all
you can with it, then what?

31:20.792 --> 31:23.252
You release it into the fire,

31:23.292 --> 31:25.422
so that something
new can become of it,

31:25.458 --> 31:27.668
something better, bread,

31:28.667 --> 31:34.207
but this transformation is
only possible with a struggle,

31:36.042 --> 31:39.172
then after that, the letting go.

31:59.583 --> 32:03.963
- I hope for nothing,
i fear nothing, I am free.

32:04.583 --> 32:05.543
- Bravo.

32:05.583 --> 32:06.333
- Thank you.

32:06.375 --> 32:07.165
- Stella.

32:07.208 --> 32:08.168
- Baba.

32:12.333 --> 32:13.793
- Is that
haralambous's bread?

32:13.833 --> 32:15.463
- It is, would you like some?

32:15.500 --> 32:18.460
- Please, thank
you, it is heavenly.

32:21.875 --> 32:22.955
- You know,

32:23.000 --> 32:25.170
we should hit some
balls sometime, father.

32:25.208 --> 32:26.418
I'd love to see you play.

32:26.458 --> 32:28.578
In fact, I'm running
a clinic this weekend.

32:28.625 --> 32:30.665
- Clinic, do
you mean at the colossus?

32:30.708 --> 32:32.748
- It's a temporary position.

32:33.333 --> 32:35.633
- I could definitely use
a few pointers, but--

32:35.667 --> 32:37.127
- a few pointers about?

32:37.167 --> 32:40.207
- Well, I'm teaching a clinic
this weekend at the golf course.

32:40.250 --> 32:42.630
Stella's invited, of course,
if she wants to come.

32:42.667 --> 32:45.127
- Well, there's no
question of her wanting to.

32:45.667 --> 32:46.997
- Well, it's free for locals.

32:47.042 --> 32:48.082
It'll be fun.

32:49.375 --> 32:51.575
- Does panayiotis
know about this?

32:51.625 --> 32:54.245
- Of course, he loves the idea.

32:54.542 --> 32:56.462
- Well, then, I gladly accept.

32:56.500 --> 32:57.880
- Good.

32:57.917 --> 33:00.287
- I can safely say that
Stella gladly accepts, too.

33:20.667 --> 33:23.247
Come on, let's go to bed.

33:23.333 --> 33:25.503
You are drunk.

33:49.917 --> 33:51.877
- Hey, there I am.

33:53.583 --> 33:56.083
- So, wait, you're telling
me that your illustrious

33:56.125 --> 33:59.245
if presently somewhat
compromised career began here?

33:59.292 --> 34:01.292
- Yeah, that's my dad.

34:01.583 --> 34:03.043
I guess that's why I can't help,

34:03.083 --> 34:05.083
but have a soft
spot for this place.

34:05.125 --> 34:07.535
I just want everyone to
love it as much as I do.

34:07.583 --> 34:10.543
- Yeah, well, good
luck with that.

34:10.583 --> 34:11.672
- What, you don't
think that we can

34:11.708 --> 34:13.498
bring people around to
caring about colossus?

34:13.542 --> 34:17.252
- Oh, whoa, what's this
we business, Ms. America?

34:17.292 --> 34:19.581
Firstly, it's your
fool's errand,

34:19.625 --> 34:21.324
should you wish to pursue it,

34:21.375 --> 34:25.034
and secondly, I think
these people care too much.

34:25.083 --> 34:26.543
It's pride.

34:26.583 --> 34:28.253
There lies the problem.

34:28.292 --> 34:30.831
- There are people
here for your clinic.

34:30.875 --> 34:35.284
Two people on the course, zero
euro in the cash register.

34:46.583 --> 34:48.083
- Hey!

35:19.625 --> 35:23.075
- I remember the first
time that I watched a game.

35:23.125 --> 35:27.125
It was so quiet, so much focus.

35:27.292 --> 35:28.502
It felt like the players

35:28.542 --> 35:31.252
were all having a
religious experience.

35:31.292 --> 35:34.832
I had to see for myself
how hard can it be

35:34.875 --> 35:37.325
to hit a ball into a hole.

35:37.625 --> 35:41.075
Well, of course,
i soon found out.

35:41.125 --> 35:44.915
Well, any idea how we get other
locals to come out and play?

35:44.958 --> 35:47.248
- It might be a little tricky.

35:47.708 --> 35:50.248
The course belonged to
the villagers, you know,

35:50.292 --> 35:53.292
and even though most
people didn't play here,

35:53.333 --> 35:55.963
we have always been
very proud to own it.

35:57.042 --> 35:59.132
It was a terrible
blow when the crisis

35:59.167 --> 36:01.827
forced us to sell
it to Mr. Henderson.

36:01.875 --> 36:03.375
So, people might not like it

36:03.417 --> 36:05.787
if they think you're
working on his behalf.

36:05.833 --> 36:07.213
- But I hardly think
offering free clinics

36:07.250 --> 36:09.420
is working on
Henderson's behalf.

36:09.458 --> 36:13.328
I mean, I just love the game,
i wanna share it, that's all.

36:13.958 --> 36:15.998
- Let's see what we can do.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.330
I would like to remind
you that next week

36:37.375 --> 36:41.875
we have organized a trip
to panormitis at simi

36:41.917 --> 36:44.287
and for everyone
who may not know,

36:44.333 --> 36:48.293
Zoe papadopoulos has begin to
offering a free golf clinic

36:48.333 --> 36:51.003
for everyone who wants
to learn to play golf

36:51.042 --> 36:53.002
at the lovely local course.

36:59.625 --> 37:03.955
And I understand there
will be free food

37:05.042 --> 37:07.002
and free drinks at the clinic.

37:18.917 --> 37:20.497
- So, what do you think?

37:20.542 --> 37:22.792
Was that a positive response
back there or negative one?

37:22.833 --> 37:24.923
- No, time will tell.

37:24.958 --> 37:27.208
I'm going to aliki's house, okay?

37:27.292 --> 37:28.632
Yes, but be back at three.

37:28.875 --> 37:30.875
No, please at four...

37:30.958 --> 37:33.708
-Three, my love!
-Okay, at four it is!

37:36.000 --> 37:37.290
- How about you?

37:37.333 --> 37:38.923
Any interest in coming
to one of my clinics?

37:38.958 --> 37:39.958
- Me?
- Yeah.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.880
No, thanks, but no,
it's not for me.

37:41.917 --> 37:44.377
Stella enjoyed herself
very much, though.

37:44.875 --> 37:47.245
- I just thought that
maybe your daughter

37:47.292 --> 37:50.212
would've infected you
both with golf-mania.

37:50.250 --> 37:53.170
- I'm afraid I don't have
the Patience for such a game.

37:53.208 --> 37:54.998
You have to be so quiet

37:55.042 --> 37:57.422
and it takes all day to play.

37:57.917 --> 38:01.917
- Yeah, my dad was the one
who played golf in my family.

38:01.958 --> 38:03.828
He taught me and
my mom the game,

38:03.875 --> 38:05.665
not just the rules and
how to swing the club,

38:05.708 --> 38:08.828
but the philosophical
aspects, too,

38:08.875 --> 38:11.125
what he called the
soul of the game.

38:11.167 --> 38:14.167
- The soul of the game,
that's very poetic.

38:14.208 --> 38:18.578
- Yup, that's my dad,
a true poet philosopher.

38:19.750 --> 38:22.750
I miss him and my
mom every single day,

38:23.000 --> 38:25.750
but I like to think
that the golf gods

38:25.792 --> 38:27.712
wanted them to be together.

38:27.750 --> 38:28.670
- The golf gods?

38:28.708 --> 38:29.998
- Yeah.

38:30.833 --> 38:33.673
My father decided that all
of the ancient Greek gods

38:33.708 --> 38:35.208
now watch over golfers.

38:35.250 --> 38:36.460
You know, since they don't have

38:36.500 --> 38:38.330
anything better
to do these days.

38:38.375 --> 38:39.825
It's kinda crazy, right?

38:39.875 --> 38:42.325
- Yeah, but a good kinda crazy,

38:42.375 --> 38:45.375
the crazy that
lightens the spirit.

38:45.792 --> 38:46.962
I could have used that back

38:47.000 --> 38:48.960
when I was an
attorney in Athens.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.880
Oh my god, I was so serious,

38:50.917 --> 38:52.577
and even though I was married,

38:52.625 --> 38:56.705
it was as if I had nothing
else to do in my life but work.

38:56.750 --> 38:58.540
- I know that feeling.

38:58.583 --> 39:01.883
So, when did you make the
transition from lawyer to teacher?

39:02.167 --> 39:04.327
- Well, Stella came
first into our lives,

39:04.375 --> 39:06.785
so we wanted her to
grow up near family,

39:06.833 --> 39:08.253
we move back to the village

39:08.292 --> 39:09.712
and that's when
i started working

39:09.750 --> 39:12.080
at panayiotis' law
firm in rose town.

39:12.125 --> 39:14.955
- Wait, panayiotis
manalakis, he was a lawyer?

39:15.000 --> 39:18.210
- Yes, actually,
a very good one,

39:18.250 --> 39:21.080
but then the crisis took many
things away from all of us,

39:21.250 --> 39:22.790
so I start teaching

39:22.833 --> 39:24.003
and I love it.

39:25.708 --> 39:27.878
So, I'm right here.

39:29.125 --> 39:31.165
I guess I'll see you again.

39:31.208 --> 39:32.168
- Okay.

39:32.208 --> 39:33.168
- Bye.
- Bye.

39:33.208 --> 39:34.078
- I'm so sorry.

39:34.125 --> 39:35.075
- Sorry.

40:32.625 --> 40:33.375
- Good.

40:33.458 --> 40:34.378
Make sure your
arms and shoulders

40:34.417 --> 40:35.877
move as one like a pendulum.

40:35.917 --> 40:36.827
Grab another.

40:46.292 --> 40:47.542
Good.

40:48.167 --> 40:50.787
- Yay, almost, very nice.

40:50.833 --> 40:54.383
- Keep the putter between
the two lines, grab another.

40:54.958 --> 40:56.668
- How she doing?

40:56.708 --> 40:58.078
- We're getting there.

41:02.333 --> 41:04.583
Good, just don't
break your wrists.

41:04.625 --> 41:06.665
- Have you
ever hit a hole in one?

41:06.708 --> 41:08.128
- Yes, many times,

41:08.167 --> 41:10.877
but it's always a
surprise when it happens.

41:11.250 --> 41:13.830
- Do you have a
favorite course to play on?

41:13.875 --> 41:16.575
- Really, my favorite
course is always changing.

41:16.625 --> 41:19.665
Right now, I'd say pebble beach,

41:19.708 --> 41:22.128
but if you ask me again,
it might be some place else.

41:22.208 --> 41:24.788
You're going to tire Zoe
with so many questions.

41:24.833 --> 41:27.083
No, I don't mind, what else?

41:27.125 --> 41:28.955
- Why did you go crazy?

41:29.000 --> 41:30.210
That is not a nice thing to say!

41:30.250 --> 41:31.540
- I'm so sorry.

41:31.583 --> 41:34.713
- No, you know,
it's fine, I did go crazy

41:35.125 --> 41:37.455
and I've been at
this game a long time

41:37.500 --> 41:39.290
and when you work so hard

41:39.333 --> 41:41.003
at something you
really care about,

41:41.042 --> 41:44.672
the bad times can
get a bit dramatic.

41:46.042 --> 41:47.212
- Okay.

41:48.792 --> 41:49.752
- Okay.

41:49.792 --> 41:51.712
My god, I'm so sorry.

42:33.333 --> 42:35.043
- I hope for nothing,

42:35.625 --> 42:36.825
I fear nothing,

42:37.958 --> 42:39.328
I am free.

43:10.000 --> 43:10.750
Are you okay?

43:10.792 --> 43:12.042
- I'm not sure Henderson
is gonna be okay

43:12.083 --> 43:13.423
with any of these changes.

43:13.458 --> 43:14.878
- You are joking me?

43:14.917 --> 43:16.707
This place is
virtually a palace now

43:16.750 --> 43:18.210
compared to what it was.

43:18.250 --> 43:20.830
People are no longer embarrassed
to be seen playing here.

43:20.875 --> 43:22.705
Look at the reservation book.

43:26.750 --> 43:28.500
- 90 rounds this week.

43:30.042 --> 43:32.292
Six new annual memberships.

43:33.125 --> 43:35.995
Plus 40 reservations
for next week.

43:37.875 --> 43:39.535
How did this happen?

43:40.125 --> 43:43.035
- Mostly the remodel and
i called in a few favors.

43:43.083 --> 43:44.293
Oh, and I got you
a little writeup

43:44.333 --> 43:46.333
in golf digest online, too.

43:46.375 --> 43:48.375
- Oh, I could kiss you both.

43:48.417 --> 43:49.787
- I'll pass on that.

43:49.833 --> 43:52.293
- Hey, has anyone shown
up yet for the clinic?

43:52.333 --> 43:54.503
- Well, no, of course not.

43:56.375 --> 43:57.915
- The who does what?

43:58.833 --> 43:59.633
- It's football.

44:10.125 --> 44:11.535
- Zoe!

44:11.583 --> 44:12.673
- Hey, everyone.

44:12.708 --> 44:14.628
- Thomas, Thomas.

44:14.667 --> 44:16.327
- I'll be at the bar.

44:20.167 --> 44:22.917
- Just a reminder that we
still have the free clinic

44:22.958 --> 44:25.128
going on at the
golf course right...

44:50.083 --> 44:52.293
So, they lost, big deal.

44:52.333 --> 44:54.923
- Football is a game we
care deeply about, Zoe.

44:54.958 --> 44:57.498
- Okay, but golf should be, too.

44:57.542 --> 45:00.172
- Name one good reason.

45:00.208 --> 45:01.998
- Besides the fact
that it's a sport

45:02.042 --> 45:05.252
you can actually play your
entire life unlike soccer.

45:05.292 --> 45:06.542
- Football.

45:06.583 --> 45:09.253
- Football, and on a
golf course right here

45:09.292 --> 45:11.632
in your own village nonetheless,

45:11.667 --> 45:16.127
I'll give you all the best
reason there is, it's Greek.

45:17.083 --> 45:20.083
- Oh god, someone's
more pissed than me.

45:20.125 --> 45:22.955
- Oh, no, no, no, hear me out.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.880
Greeks invented
everything, right?

45:24.917 --> 45:26.037
- Not everything.

45:26.083 --> 45:27.423
- Most everything.

45:27.458 --> 45:29.288
- Well, golf is one of
the things they invented.

45:29.333 --> 45:31.003
- Well, as a subject of the uk,

45:31.042 --> 45:34.292
I do feel compelled to point
out it was actually the scots.

45:34.333 --> 45:39.833
Well, a kilt looks an awful
lot like a fustanella to me.

45:40.000 --> 45:43.880
- Yeah, actually, bagpipes
are mentioned in the odyssey.

45:43.917 --> 45:45.377
- Yes.

45:45.417 --> 45:48.957
And the name Scotland
comes from the Greek "skotia"

45:49.000 --> 45:51.880
which is the Greek word
for the land of darkness.

45:51.917 --> 45:54.497
Their patron Saint
is our San Andreas

45:54.542 --> 45:57.832
and his cross
appears on their flag

45:57.875 --> 46:01.125
which happens to have the
same colors as our flag.

46:01.167 --> 46:03.707
- I think that's
stretching it a little bit.

46:03.750 --> 46:09.210
- And if you go back even
further before Scotland existed,

46:09.292 --> 46:14.132
you've got the development of
geometry, philosophy, physics,

46:14.167 --> 46:18.327
all concepts rooted
in ancient Greece,

46:18.583 --> 46:21.293
all essential to
the game of golf,

46:21.333 --> 46:24.583
and then there's the
influence of the Greek gods.

46:24.625 --> 46:28.325
I mean, you have Hephaestus
who forges our mighty clubs

46:28.375 --> 46:32.165
and Athena who gives us the
wisdom to choose our shots

46:32.208 --> 46:33.958
and Apollo who guides our aim.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.380
- Dionysus who inspired

46:36.417 --> 46:39.497
this brilliantly insane
conversation, allow me, Zoe.

46:39.542 --> 46:40.752
- Please.

46:40.792 --> 46:43.922
- Poseidon who tests
and tortures us

46:43.958 --> 46:45.918
with his hazardous water.

46:45.958 --> 46:48.078
- Ares who gives us energy.

46:48.125 --> 46:49.415
- Yes, pappous.

46:49.458 --> 46:52.458
- You're aware we no longer
believe in these gods?

46:52.500 --> 46:54.210
- Not literally, maybe,

46:54.250 --> 46:56.330
but they're still a part
of the Greek psyche.

46:56.375 --> 46:59.035
- Then why don't the
greeks play golf?

46:59.083 --> 47:00.463
- I don't know.

47:01.500 --> 47:02.880
I mean,

47:03.167 --> 47:06.247
maybe we get so
caught up in our past,

47:06.292 --> 47:10.422
sometimes we forget to
appreciate the present,

47:10.458 --> 47:11.748
but in golf,

47:12.708 --> 47:15.038
the present is
all that matters.

47:15.833 --> 47:18.043
Nothing else exists.

47:18.083 --> 47:19.543
No failures.

47:19.875 --> 47:21.665
No disappointments.

47:23.792 --> 47:25.042
It's just you and

47:27.542 --> 47:29.082
the ball, the green,

47:30.125 --> 47:32.285
everything else falls off.

47:36.292 --> 47:38.132
Anyway, do you
really want the scots

47:38.167 --> 47:40.577
to take all the credit
for this glorious game

47:40.625 --> 47:42.705
when everything it represents

47:42.750 --> 47:45.880
is key to the Greek
mind and soul?

47:49.583 --> 47:50.583
No.

47:50.833 --> 47:52.583
What about Henderson?

47:52.625 --> 47:54.075
I mean, he might own colossus,

47:54.125 --> 47:56.245
but he doesn't own golf, right?

47:56.292 --> 47:57.962
No!

47:58.000 --> 48:00.880
Right, so make the game yours.

48:00.917 --> 48:03.537
I want you to go out
there, hit some balls,

48:03.583 --> 48:05.133
and rediscover your roots.

48:05.167 --> 48:05.917
- Yes.

48:24.333 --> 48:26.543
- Here are the purchase
orders you asked for.

48:26.583 --> 48:27.633
Oh, and I'm taking these,

48:27.667 --> 48:29.497
so just take 'em out
of my commission.

48:29.542 --> 48:30.672
- Do you want tsipouro?

48:30.708 --> 48:31.998
It's good for hangover.

48:32.042 --> 48:33.712
- God, no, I'm never
touching that stuff again.

48:33.750 --> 48:39.130
- Okay, but I'm telling you,
dog's hair is the only cure.

48:39.333 --> 48:42.793
- Well, I rather
suffer, it'll pass.

48:42.833 --> 48:44.793
- Some suffering does not pass.

48:45.292 --> 48:47.752
The Henderson kind of suffering,

48:47.792 --> 48:49.382
working for this man

48:50.250 --> 48:51.960
is worse than any hangover.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.670
- Then why do you do it?

48:53.708 --> 48:54.998
- Money.

48:55.042 --> 48:57.632
If I could make the
course profitable,

48:57.667 --> 48:59.787
I could be an equal partner.

48:59.833 --> 49:01.383
- Well then, why
are you so upset?

49:01.417 --> 49:02.377
You have more customers now

49:02.417 --> 49:03.787
than you've probably ever had.

49:03.833 --> 49:07.793
- Everybody hates me,
the whole village, I have no one.

49:07.833 --> 49:10.633
The only girl I ever loved
married somebody else,

49:10.667 --> 49:13.877
my parents are long gone,
my brother is abroad,

49:13.917 --> 49:16.827
and last year, my dog, she left,

49:16.875 --> 49:19.455
I have no one except Henderson,

49:19.500 --> 49:23.000
this greedy snake,
a lying pig.

49:23.042 --> 49:26.922
- Panayiotis, you either
had too much of that stuff

49:26.958 --> 49:28.788
or not nearly enough.

49:34.667 --> 49:35.827
- Wow.

49:35.875 --> 49:37.705
Great shot, agapi.

49:37.750 --> 49:38.630
- Hey.

49:38.667 --> 49:39.747
- Hey.

49:39.792 --> 49:41.132
- I thought I'd find you here.

49:41.167 --> 49:44.377
Marcos, you on the other
hand I didn't expect to see.

49:44.417 --> 49:45.997
What brings you
to Stella's cliff?

49:46.042 --> 49:48.752
- I wanted to show
baba my special place.

49:48.792 --> 49:49.752
- I see.

49:51.333 --> 49:53.923
I have something here for you.

49:54.250 --> 49:55.500
- Really?

49:55.542 --> 49:57.712
- That's too generous
of you, Zoe, thank you.

49:57.750 --> 50:00.250
- No, Stella deserves them.

50:00.292 --> 50:03.752
So, wanna have a
little lesson today?

50:03.792 --> 50:05.252
- Can I please, baba?

50:05.292 --> 50:08.212
- Sure, sure, I'll just
stand out of the way.

50:08.708 --> 50:09.828
- Let's see.

50:12.958 --> 50:16.248
Okay, I want you to
grab the seven iron.

50:17.583 --> 50:19.043
Today's lesson is this,

50:19.083 --> 50:21.463
you're gonna tee off
with your eyes closed.

50:21.500 --> 50:23.170
- What, that's impossible.

50:23.208 --> 50:25.708
- Nothing's impossible,
you can do this, Stella.

50:25.750 --> 50:28.750
You just have to believe
it, close your eyes.

50:29.375 --> 50:30.325
Go ahead.

50:33.333 --> 50:36.133
Now, I want you to feel
the sun on your face.

50:36.167 --> 50:38.457
Hear the sound of the waves.

50:38.500 --> 50:40.630
Smell the salt in the air.

50:40.667 --> 50:44.417
And imagine yourself
hitting the perfect shot.

50:45.417 --> 50:48.127
If you can envision yourself
taking the perfect swing,

50:48.167 --> 50:52.167
really seeing and hearing
yourself connect with the ball,

50:52.208 --> 50:53.828
anything is possible.

50:55.250 --> 50:56.000
Now.

50:56.958 --> 50:58.998
See the shot in your head.

50:59.708 --> 51:01.208
Take a deep breath.

51:02.667 --> 51:03.627
Exhale.

51:04.917 --> 51:06.247
And swing away.

51:14.667 --> 51:16.207
Woo!
- Bravo.

51:16.750 --> 51:19.420
Great shot, bravo, agapi!

51:19.583 --> 51:23.793
- Baba, did you see, I can
golf with my eyes closed?

51:23.833 --> 51:25.083
- How did you know

51:25.125 --> 51:27.245
she can hit the ball
without looking at it?

51:27.875 --> 51:29.825
- I have a confession to make.

51:29.875 --> 51:32.375
I actually didn't know for sure.

51:32.417 --> 51:33.167
- What?

51:33.208 --> 51:34.498
- Yeah?

51:34.542 --> 51:35.792
- Come on, that could
have been a disaster.

51:35.833 --> 51:37.293
- Yeah, I know,
i know, but, I mean,

51:37.333 --> 51:38.923
don't you find that
the best things in life

51:38.958 --> 51:42.328
come when you're one step
away from catastrophe?

51:42.375 --> 51:44.575
You know, like when
you take a risk.

51:44.625 --> 51:46.875
- Yeah, I think
i know what you mean.

52:40.583 --> 52:43.543
- Pappous, what are
you all doing here?

52:43.583 --> 52:45.003
- We are here for the clinic.

52:45.042 --> 52:46.882
And the free food!

52:47.958 --> 52:49.378
- Okay.

52:49.417 --> 52:52.917
Before we begin let us
bow our heads in prayer.

52:53.625 --> 52:57.165
Dear lord, guide this
flock of virgin golfers

52:57.208 --> 52:58.748
to replace their divots.

52:58.792 --> 53:01.712
Teach them to not stand
in front of other golfers

53:01.750 --> 53:02.920
when they're hitting.

53:02.958 --> 53:06.208
Remind them to rake all traps.

53:06.750 --> 53:09.880
Compel them to yell "fore"

53:09.958 --> 53:13.288
when they ball may
strike someone's head.

53:13.875 --> 53:18.535
May they enjoy the fruits of
the game and not kill anyone.

53:19.833 --> 53:20.583
Amen.

53:20.625 --> 53:21.665
- Amen.

53:21.708 --> 53:23.168
- Let the chaos begin.

54:08.875 --> 54:10.285
- Please stop with your balls.

54:10.333 --> 54:11.713
Hold your balls.

54:40.875 --> 54:42.745
So how do you win
a golf game?

54:42.833 --> 54:44.253
I'll tell you...

54:44.333 --> 54:48.253
You throw your balls,
they get in the hole, and if...

54:48.333 --> 54:51.253
What if you throw too hard
and it goes really far?

54:59.583 --> 55:00.713
Cheers!

55:04.625 --> 55:07.205
So you throw it 900 feet away
and then what?

55:07.292 --> 55:08.962
-Then you lose...
-No, you get another ball.

55:09.042 --> 55:11.832
-You either win or lose...
-No, it's very simple...

55:11.917 --> 55:13.997
You throw it from here,
it goes over there...

55:14.083 --> 55:15.883
Then I get my ball
and I run like hell...

55:16.583 --> 55:20.833
We try to get the balls into the holes!
Cheers!

55:23.167 --> 55:24.457
- Oh my god, it's him.

55:24.500 --> 55:25.250
- Who?

55:25.292 --> 55:26.252
- Henderson.

55:26.292 --> 55:27.382
Henderson!

55:27.417 --> 55:31.417
Get out of here now! All of you!

55:36.542 --> 55:38.792
- What's going on here, pano?

55:39.417 --> 55:40.707
Who are all these people?

55:42.333 --> 55:44.133
- Hi, you must be Mr. Henderson,

55:44.167 --> 55:46.667
can I get you something
to eat or drink?

55:46.708 --> 55:47.958
- Who are you?

55:48.000 --> 55:50.130
- I'm your pro,
Zoe papadopoulos.

55:51.167 --> 55:52.627
- Zoe papadopoulos,

55:52.667 --> 55:56.997
you hired Zoe papadopoulos
as the golf pro?

55:57.417 --> 56:00.627
The meltdown queen of the lpga?

56:01.167 --> 56:02.377
What were you gonna do?

56:02.417 --> 56:04.457
To hold a clinic
on golf etiquette?

56:10.042 --> 56:11.082
- Everything okay here, Glenn?

56:11.125 --> 56:12.745
- Yeah, everything's fine,

56:12.792 --> 56:14.422
this has nothing to
do with our deal.

56:14.458 --> 56:15.668
- Deal?

56:15.708 --> 56:17.038
What deal, sir?

56:17.083 --> 56:19.043
- You know, maybe today
really isn't the kinda day

56:19.083 --> 56:20.043
we should be doing this.

56:20.083 --> 56:21.333
We'll try it again tomorrow.

56:21.375 --> 56:22.785
Antonopoulos would
you take these guys

56:22.833 --> 56:24.583
back to the yacht, please?

56:24.625 --> 56:26.285
- Deal, what are you
talking about, sir?

56:26.333 --> 56:28.213
- None of your goddamn business.

56:28.250 --> 56:29.330
- I thought we were partners.

56:29.375 --> 56:31.075
- Oh, we're not partners.

56:31.125 --> 56:32.165
You're fired.

56:32.208 --> 56:33.288
- What?

56:33.333 --> 56:35.083
- And that goes
for Ms. yips, too.

56:35.708 --> 56:37.248
You can relax because
your little village

56:37.292 --> 56:40.672
is about to become a
world-class destination.

56:40.708 --> 56:43.628
I'm selling this property
to those two gentlemen there

56:43.667 --> 56:46.747
and they're gonna build
a five star golf resort.

56:46.792 --> 56:48.042
- You're selling.

56:48.083 --> 56:49.713
- Sir, you
just bought it.

56:49.750 --> 56:51.750
- It's gonna be a kind
of a club med here.

56:51.792 --> 56:55.082
We're gonna have a hotel,
shopping, resort, restaurants,

56:55.125 --> 56:56.875
there's even gonna
be a waterpark,

56:57.250 --> 57:00.170
and maybe you could find
yourself a job flipping burgers

57:00.208 --> 57:03.958
at one of the many
convenient poolside cafes.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.210
As for the rest of you,

57:06.250 --> 57:08.210
get the hell outta here.

57:09.125 --> 57:10.705
This place is closed.

57:11.292 --> 57:14.292
- Wow, you really know
how to liven up a party.

57:14.625 --> 57:15.745
- Are you okay?

57:15.792 --> 57:18.332
- Of course not, son of a bitch.

57:18.375 --> 57:20.415
- Panayiotis, we can fix this.

57:20.458 --> 57:23.208
- Oh, come on, how
can I fix this?

57:23.250 --> 57:25.420
He has the money,
the power, the glory.

57:25.458 --> 57:27.328
- You have the
power of your own.

57:27.375 --> 57:29.125
We all have the power!

57:29.500 --> 57:31.290
- Sorry, what are you
guys talking about?

57:31.333 --> 57:33.253
- Come on, don't you remember?

57:33.292 --> 57:34.462
All the work.

57:38.042 --> 57:39.082
- Come with me.

57:40.583 --> 57:42.583
- What, where we're going?

57:43.583 --> 57:46.133
- Panayiotis, what is this mess?

57:47.375 --> 57:48.955
- What exactly are
you guys looking for?

57:49.000 --> 57:49.750
- My weapon.

57:49.792 --> 57:50.712
- What?

57:50.750 --> 57:51.880
- I'm going to destroy him.

57:51.917 --> 57:53.537
- Look, this is not a solution.

57:53.583 --> 57:55.253
Violence isn't the answer.

57:57.125 --> 57:59.875
- Here, I found
it, the contract.

58:03.292 --> 58:05.672
Panayiotis represented the
town in the land purchase.

58:05.708 --> 58:07.918
It's the last deal we
made before closing the firm.

58:07.958 --> 58:09.248
- I'm done with him,

58:09.292 --> 58:12.962
this cheap, lying,
gambling-addicted bastard.

58:14.625 --> 58:20.165
Be quiet, please! Quiet!
Sit down! Quiet!

58:21.750 --> 58:24.960
Shut up!
The mayor is speaking!

58:25.042 --> 58:26.542
Come on, mayor.

58:26.625 --> 58:28.955
We're here to discuss...

58:29.083 --> 58:33.083
The options to Mr. Henderson's
development plans.

58:33.167 --> 58:34.997
What are our legal rights?

58:35.083 --> 58:37.583
Options?
Rights?

58:37.875 --> 58:40.785
What rights could we have after that idiot
panayiotis signed them all away?

58:40.958 --> 58:42.498
I have the contract.

58:43.083 --> 58:46.333
Quiet, you! You're the one
who got us into this mess.

58:46.417 --> 58:48.327
- Come on, let him
talk, give him a chance.

58:48.375 --> 58:50.325
- The contract says,

58:50.833 --> 58:52.883
"notwithstanding the
sale of the property

58:52.917 --> 58:54.997
"by the buyer at
any future date,

58:55.042 --> 58:58.382
"all development right are
hereby exclusively reserved

58:58.417 --> 59:00.247
"by the village named herein

59:00.292 --> 59:05.542
"and therefore any and all new
development of the property,

59:05.792 --> 59:09.962
"both now and in
perpetuity shall be subject

59:10.000 --> 59:12.460
"to the full approval
of the same."

59:12.500 --> 59:13.580
Understand it?

59:13.625 --> 59:15.495
What the hell does that mean?

59:16.750 --> 59:18.000
Listen, listen.

59:18.042 --> 59:21.132
Henderson cannot go
through with his plans

59:21.167 --> 59:24.077
unless we allow it, okay?

59:35.208 --> 59:37.668
- That hotel and the new
building and the parking lot,

59:37.708 --> 59:39.708
the last thing they
do is put it in.

59:41.333 --> 59:43.383
All right, Roland,
stay with me on this.

59:43.417 --> 59:44.957
I'm thinking luxury
suites right here

59:45.000 --> 59:47.330
to take advantage of the
five star oceanfront view

59:47.375 --> 59:49.575
and then we go shopping,
shopping, shopping,

59:49.625 --> 59:52.955
and then on that pad,
that one up there,

59:53.000 --> 59:55.130
is where the aegean sea finally

59:55.167 --> 59:59.327
comes to face to face with its
natural enemy, the waterpark.

01:00:02.667 --> 01:00:04.327
Oh my god.

01:00:04.667 --> 01:00:06.207
It's the village people.

01:00:12.292 --> 01:00:14.132
It's like a scene
out of a movie,

01:00:14.167 --> 01:00:17.077
but they usually come with
torches and pitchforks.

01:00:21.542 --> 01:00:23.792
Excuse me, people, you are,

01:00:23.833 --> 01:00:25.753
antonopoulos, come here.

01:00:25.792 --> 01:00:28.212
Would you please tell
them in gibberish

01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:31.630
that they're trespassing
on private property?

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.960
He wants you
to give up your own land.

01:00:35.083 --> 01:00:36.213
...the barbarian.

01:00:36.250 --> 01:00:40.080
Thank you very much, that was
very heartfelt, what he said.

01:00:40.125 --> 01:00:44.625
- You might want to read again
the contract, Mr. Henderson,

01:00:44.667 --> 01:00:45.957
there is a clause in it

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.790
that protect this
land even from you.

01:00:49.833 --> 01:00:53.333
You cannot hammer a single
nail without our permission.

01:00:53.375 --> 01:00:56.285
And we do not give him
the permission. Do we?

01:00:56.375 --> 01:00:57.875
No!

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:11.917
- Bullshit.

01:01:19.875 --> 01:01:21.165
All right, it's a technicality.

01:01:21.208 --> 01:01:22.828
I'm willing to deal
with some legal issues.

01:01:22.875 --> 01:01:24.285
- That's your choice,

01:01:24.333 --> 01:01:27.083
but I can personally guarantee

01:01:27.125 --> 01:01:29.285
we will keep you in
courts for years.

01:01:29.333 --> 01:01:30.673
- Is that so?

01:01:30.708 --> 01:01:31.958
Well, I'm guessing
that by the time

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.540
you greeks get
your shit together,

01:01:33.583 --> 01:01:34.883
I will have made this sale,

01:01:34.917 --> 01:01:36.497
they will have filled in
this place with concrete

01:01:36.542 --> 01:01:39.462
and we'll all have ourselves
a really nice ribbon-cutting.

01:01:40.333 --> 01:01:43.423
- I hear you're a gambling
man, Mr. Henderson.

01:01:45.792 --> 01:01:48.382
Maybe there's another
way we can settle this.

01:01:48.917 --> 01:01:50.537
- And what would that be?

01:01:51.375 --> 01:01:52.665
- I don't know,

01:01:52.708 --> 01:01:55.828
maybe a simple golf
match between you and me.

01:01:55.875 --> 01:01:58.075
- How stupid do i
look, you're a pro.

01:01:58.708 --> 01:02:00.828
- A pro with questionable
mental health

01:02:00.875 --> 01:02:04.125
as you so kindly put it
and a bad case of the yips.

01:02:04.667 --> 01:02:08.577
- Unless maybe you're
afraid of losing to a woman.

01:02:12.875 --> 01:02:14.625
- All right, I'll bite,
what are the stakes?

01:02:14.667 --> 01:02:16.207
- You win, you make your sale,

01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:18.420
and they can build
whatever they like.

01:02:18.458 --> 01:02:19.458
- And if I lose?

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:22.330
- Ownership of the property
reverts back to the village.

01:02:26.292 --> 01:02:27.962
Do we have a deal?

01:02:28.833 --> 01:02:29.923
- One change.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.880
I want somebody who will
properly represent the village,

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:35.287
somebody who's got a
little skin in the game,

01:02:35.333 --> 01:02:37.383
somebody who was born here.

01:02:38.125 --> 01:02:41.455
Where you born here,
Ms. papadopoulos, I think not.

01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:45.920
- It's a little unfair given
they just learned the game.

01:02:45.958 --> 01:02:48.248
- Yeah, isn't that a shame?

01:02:49.583 --> 01:02:53.383
Their player for their
property, that's my deal.

01:02:55.792 --> 01:02:56.882
Any takers?

01:03:03.250 --> 01:03:05.130
I didn't think so.

01:03:05.833 --> 01:03:08.133
So, if you don't mind,
I'm gonna excuse myself

01:03:08.167 --> 01:03:10.037
and I can call and
have you arrested

01:03:10.083 --> 01:03:12.713
or you can turn around and
leave the way you came.

01:03:15.417 --> 01:03:16.167
- Wait.

01:03:18.250 --> 01:03:19.420
I'll play you.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.380
- Stella.

01:03:22.417 --> 01:03:23.787
- I can win, baba.

01:03:28.542 --> 01:03:31.542
- You've got to be kidding me.

01:03:31.583 --> 01:03:35.083
You people are pathetic,
you're embarrassing yourselves.

01:03:35.125 --> 01:03:37.375
- You're right, why
don't we ask the village?

01:03:37.417 --> 01:03:40.207
How do you feel about
Stella representing us?

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:43.420
- Yes!
- Yeah, of course.

01:03:43.458 --> 01:03:45.208
- I think you have your answer.

01:03:46.667 --> 01:03:48.957
So, do we have a bet?

01:04:21.458 --> 01:04:22.878
Goodnight, baba.

01:04:24.417 --> 01:04:26.747
I want you to know
I'm very proud of you.

01:04:28.417 --> 01:04:30.127
You're much braver
than I am.

01:04:30.875 --> 01:04:35.785
I wish mama could be here
to see me beat the American.

01:04:35.875 --> 01:04:40.415
She'll be watching you
from above...

01:04:41.542 --> 01:04:43.882
And she'll be proud of you, too.

01:04:50.333 --> 01:04:52.043
Goodnight, my angel.

01:04:52.125 --> 01:04:54.035
Goodnight, baba.

01:05:06.417 --> 01:05:09.707
- I must be out of my
mind letting her do this.

01:05:12.292 --> 01:05:13.082
If she loses--

01:05:13.125 --> 01:05:14.375
- she won't lose.

01:05:15.583 --> 01:05:18.423
- He's an adult, Zoe,
he's a mature man

01:05:18.458 --> 01:05:20.458
who has been playing this
game for who knows how long,

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.460
the whole idea to
me is really absurd.

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:25.540
- Wait, listen, I've been
doing a lot of research

01:05:25.583 --> 01:05:29.713
on Glenn Henderson's game,
at best, he's a five handicap,

01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:33.040
and panayiotis said he didn't
even shoot par at colossus.

01:05:33.083 --> 01:05:35.173
- Say it in English,
what does this mean?

01:05:35.208 --> 01:05:38.418
- It means that she
can take him, Marcos.

01:05:38.458 --> 01:05:40.418
She has a chance to win.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:43.750
- Hi, Derek.

01:05:43.792 --> 01:05:45.632
- Finally, you pick up,

01:05:45.667 --> 01:05:47.247
I've been trying to
reach you forever.

01:05:47.292 --> 01:05:49.712
- I know, I'm sorry, I just
really needed to unplug.

01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:52.710
- I wanted to let you know
your suspension is over.

01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:54.000
- Really?

01:05:54.042 --> 01:05:55.672
- Yeah, they
dropped it a week ago,

01:05:55.708 --> 01:05:57.378
so come into my office tomorrow,

01:05:57.417 --> 01:05:59.247
I've got a few dates lined up.

01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:06.580
- I kind of have
tournament here tomorrow.

01:06:06.625 --> 01:06:07.625
- Where is here?

01:06:07.667 --> 01:06:09.167
I don't know what you're doing.

01:06:09.208 --> 01:06:11.458
- Relax, Derek,
it's not a paying gig.

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:12.920
- Is this charity again, Zoe?

01:06:12.958 --> 01:06:14.418
I hate when you do charity.

01:06:14.458 --> 01:06:16.748
- Derek, besides,
I'm not even playing,

01:06:16.792 --> 01:06:18.042
I'm just being a caddie.

01:06:18.083 --> 01:06:19.793
- Oh god, this is
worse than I thought.

01:06:19.833 --> 01:06:21.463
- Would you stop?

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:24.540
- Okay, call me when you get
back, hopefully that's soon.

01:06:24.583 --> 01:06:25.633
- I will.

01:06:26.375 --> 01:06:27.165
Goodnight.

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:07.380
- Ouzo, I love the
way that sounds.

01:07:08.083 --> 01:07:10.213
- I want this
business deal done.

01:07:10.250 --> 01:07:11.920
- Roland, you're
getting all of this

01:07:11.958 --> 01:07:15.038
pristine oceanfront property
for 20 cents on the dollar.

01:07:15.083 --> 01:07:17.423
I've gotta be crazy for selling
it to you for that price

01:07:17.458 --> 01:07:18.788
and you know that.

01:07:18.833 --> 01:07:20.293
You work your developmental
magic on this,

01:07:20.333 --> 01:07:21.963
you're gonna have
a piece of property

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.920
that's worth 10 times what
you paid for it, 10 times.

01:07:24.958 --> 01:07:27.458
- Shall we begin, Mr. Henderson?

01:07:29.208 --> 01:07:33.378
- All right, come on, gentlemen,
let's go have some fun.

01:07:35.792 --> 01:07:40.082
Well, it looks like we've
got ourselves a gallery.

01:07:44.042 --> 01:07:47.582
Stand aside, everyone,
i take large steps.

01:07:58.792 --> 01:08:01.172
- Welcome, everyone and
"kalimera".

01:08:01.208 --> 01:08:02.628
- "Kalimera".

01:08:02.667 --> 01:08:04.997
For today, format will
be an 18 hole match play

01:08:05.042 --> 01:08:09.832
between Mr. Glenn Henderson
and our very own Stella russos.

01:08:15.708 --> 01:08:17.707
I will serve as today's referee.

01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:19.830
Now, we shall flip to
see who goes first.

01:08:19.875 --> 01:08:22.705
- Why don't we dispense with
the formalities there, padre?

01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:24.670
I'll tee off first.

01:08:25.082 --> 01:08:26.633
Owner's prerogative.

01:08:37.292 --> 01:08:38.671
Keep that close.

01:08:58.082 --> 01:09:00.883
I'd bet you'd like
a piece of that.

01:09:05.042 --> 01:09:08.042
- It's called
sportsmanship, my friends.

01:09:12.667 --> 01:09:15.667
- Just go play your game,
Stella, you got this, okay?

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.630
- That had so much box.

01:09:40.082 --> 01:09:41.502
It's okay.

01:09:47.082 --> 01:09:48.712
- Do you wanna sweeten
the pot a little bit,

01:09:48.750 --> 01:09:50.580
say, $100 a hole?

01:09:52.625 --> 01:09:55.375
I'll just play for
a box of thin mints.

01:11:07.583 --> 01:11:09.713
Oh, like a god.

01:11:10.583 --> 01:11:13.083
Don't hand out titles easily.

01:11:30.583 --> 01:11:32.003
Oh, that's a shame.

01:11:32.042 --> 01:11:35.082
She's been spraying that
ball all over the frontline,

01:11:35.125 --> 01:11:38.035
legs are probably getting
a little tired now, too.

01:11:38.083 --> 01:11:39.963
Hey, Roland, see the
top of that hill,

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.080
that flat pad up there,

01:11:41.125 --> 01:11:43.705
that is where you
put the waterpark.

01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:44.880
- Oh, nice.

01:11:44.917 --> 01:11:46.037
Jackass!

01:11:46.583 --> 01:11:48.133
- Wait, there's a
word I recognize.

01:11:48.167 --> 01:11:50.747
Defeat sounds the
same in any language.

01:11:50.792 --> 01:11:52.712
You'd know all about
that, though, wouldn't ya?

01:11:52.750 --> 01:11:54.830
Zoe with the sign of a z,

01:11:56.125 --> 01:11:58.075
washed up has-been pro
that's relegated now

01:11:58.125 --> 01:11:59.415
to caddying for a child.

01:11:59.458 --> 01:12:02.628
Boy, I'd say your life
has hit an all-time low.

01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:07.250
- Yeah, well, you're
an all-time low.

01:13:12.125 --> 01:13:15.995
- After nine holes, Mr.
Henderson is four up.

01:13:24.375 --> 01:13:26.665
What happened? Why is she angry?

01:14:13.458 --> 01:14:17.628
- What is that, the ancient
grecian rattle torture?

01:14:23.458 --> 01:14:26.328
- God and I both saw
that, Mr. Henderson.

01:14:26.583 --> 01:14:27.633
- Really?

01:14:28.542 --> 01:14:30.502
Well, I'll tell you what,
I'll deal with god later,

01:14:30.542 --> 01:14:31.962
how about a small
donation to your church

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.750
that says you didn't?

01:14:34.292 --> 01:14:36.922
- I'm afraid it
doesn't work that way.

01:14:36.958 --> 01:14:39.918
- Come on, padre,
do we have a deal?

01:14:42.292 --> 01:14:46.382
- Now, you'll be hitting your
second shot, Mr. Henderson.

01:14:46.417 --> 01:14:49.077
- They will never
find your body.

01:14:59.833 --> 01:15:03.043
- No, my five iron
for everything.

01:15:03.083 --> 01:15:04.043
- Everything?

01:15:04.083 --> 01:15:06.583
- Yes, have a
little faith, okay?

01:15:09.167 --> 01:15:11.417
- I don't have a little faith.

01:15:11.458 --> 01:15:14.128
I don't even have
a lot of faith.

01:15:14.167 --> 01:15:17.537
What you have, Stella,
is all of my faith.

01:15:40.542 --> 01:15:44.712
- You're goliath and I'm
David, I will watch you fall.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.880
- Feeling any
pressure, Henderson.

01:16:27.917 --> 01:16:29.167
- I don't feel pressure.

01:16:29.208 --> 01:16:31.248
Some people get headaches,
i like to give 'em.

01:16:31.292 --> 01:16:33.042
Give me a nine iron.

01:16:53.125 --> 01:16:54.455
Get down.

01:16:54.792 --> 01:16:56.332
Get down.

01:16:56.375 --> 01:16:57.625
Get down.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.210
- Out of bounds.

01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:02.170
Out of bounds.

01:17:03.208 --> 01:17:06.288
You're killing me!

01:17:08.125 --> 01:17:12.165
- I asked for a nine
iron not a six iron.

01:17:12.208 --> 01:17:13.628
Bozo.

01:17:13.667 --> 01:17:15.327
- That is a one stroke penalty.

01:17:15.375 --> 01:17:17.285
You'll be hitting your
first shot from the field.

01:17:17.333 --> 01:17:19.173
- You son of a bitch.

01:19:07.542 --> 01:19:11.332
- All even with only
one hole to play.

01:19:18.042 --> 01:19:19.502
- Whoops.

01:19:43.292 --> 01:19:45.132
Cocktails.

01:19:45.875 --> 01:19:48.995
What can I say, it's a gift,
and I've gotta share it.

01:20:15.333 --> 01:20:19.463
- Okay, you might be in the
bunker, Stella, come on.

01:20:28.292 --> 01:20:30.172
- Now, that's why
god made a nine iron

01:20:30.208 --> 01:20:33.708
because that's how far
it's supposed to go.

01:20:40.875 --> 01:20:44.285
- Relax, you can hit
the green from here.

01:21:02.917 --> 01:21:05.457
It's okay, you can
still make the putt.

01:21:06.125 --> 01:21:07.705
Stella, Stella!

01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:09.960
Stella, what happened?

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.830
- What happened, agapi?

01:21:11.875 --> 01:21:14.575
- I hit something
hard under the sand.

01:21:14.625 --> 01:21:17.165
- Come on, let's get
you out, come on.

01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:30.380
- Great, can't dig
anywhere in this country

01:21:30.417 --> 01:21:32.667
without discovering
an ancient city.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.630
- How good are you at
lining up a gimme, padre?

01:21:46.667 --> 01:21:48.247
- The child is hurt.

01:21:50.208 --> 01:21:51.458
The game is over.

01:22:02.875 --> 01:22:05.705
- Gentleman, let's
go sign a contract.

01:22:14.542 --> 01:22:15.292
- Wait.

01:22:20.333 --> 01:22:21.883
Let me hit the putt.

01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:24.670
- You?

01:22:25.083 --> 01:22:28.133
- And I'll sweeten the deal
with a little side bet.

01:22:28.542 --> 01:22:31.252
All of last year's
tour earnings if I miss

01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:37.000
and I'll use the five iron.

01:22:38.625 --> 01:22:41.665
- Oh, this is like
the perfect storm?

01:22:41.708 --> 01:22:43.998
- Come on, you're
a gambling man.

01:22:45.458 --> 01:22:47.498
What, are you afraid of me?

01:22:48.458 --> 01:22:49.788
- Afraid of you?

01:22:55.625 --> 01:22:56.575
You're on.

01:23:04.542 --> 01:23:09.632
You don't mind if I just
finish my birdie, do you?

01:23:09.667 --> 01:23:10.747
- Be my guest.

01:23:17.083 --> 01:23:18.213
- My par.

01:23:22.750 --> 01:23:24.500
All yours, Princess.

01:24:17.583 --> 01:24:19.753
I hope for nothing.

01:24:19.833 --> 01:24:22.423
I fear nothing.

01:24:26.292 --> 01:24:29.002
I am free.

01:25:17.958 --> 01:25:19.378
- Shit.

01:25:20.333 --> 01:25:21.333
Guys.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.670
Guys, hold on.

01:25:44.083 --> 01:25:45.753
"A golf star is born"

01:26:12.083 --> 01:26:13.923
- good morning, hotshot.

01:26:13.958 --> 01:26:14.788
Good morning!

01:26:14.833 --> 01:26:15.583
-Good morning!

01:26:15.625 --> 01:26:17.075
- Is she okay with you?

01:26:17.125 --> 01:26:18.955
- Yeah, of course.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.210
Actually, I wanted to
talk to you anyway,

01:26:21.250 --> 01:26:22.460
might be my only chance

01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:25.000
before all your admirers
start crowding in.

01:26:26.875 --> 01:26:28.205
You can keep that.

01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:31.380
- That's okay, my father
bought about 25 this morning.

01:26:31.417 --> 01:26:33.037
- I bet he did.

01:26:33.458 --> 01:26:34.878
- What do you want
to talk about?

01:26:34.917 --> 01:26:36.287
- Well.

01:26:36.333 --> 01:26:37.753
It's just that...

01:26:39.958 --> 01:26:41.038
It's time for me to leave.

01:26:41.083 --> 01:26:43.383
I gotta go back out on tour.

01:26:43.417 --> 01:26:45.037
- When?

01:26:45.083 --> 01:26:45.963
- Tomorrow.

01:26:46.625 --> 01:26:49.375
Love, do you want
a lemonade or something?

01:26:49.792 --> 01:26:51.252
Stella.

01:26:51.292 --> 01:26:52.672
- What happened?

01:26:53.917 --> 01:26:55.747
- My suspension got lifted.

01:26:56.417 --> 01:26:58.787
I told her it was
time for me to leave.

01:26:59.333 --> 01:27:00.043
- Okay.

01:27:08.542 --> 01:27:09.292
- Stella.

01:27:11.333 --> 01:27:13.043
- She'll be fine.

01:27:13.083 --> 01:27:15.173
She just needs more time.

01:27:20.083 --> 01:27:22.923
- I didn't mean to upset
her, I feel really terrible.

01:27:22.958 --> 01:27:25.708
I just thought it'd be best
if I told her the news myself.

01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:27.250
- Of course it was, Zoe.

01:27:27.292 --> 01:27:29.212
You had to be the
one to tell her.

01:27:29.250 --> 01:27:31.040
You see, for Stella,
when people leave,

01:27:31.083 --> 01:27:33.583
she can't help but think
it's going to be forever.

01:27:33.625 --> 01:27:35.375
- But it's not gonna be forever.

01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:37.917
I plan to come back
a lot more often.

01:27:38.208 --> 01:27:39.958
- It's only fair that
you follow your dream,

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:44.170
not just for yourself,
but for others you inspire.

01:27:46.750 --> 01:27:47.710
Like Stella.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.630
- Look, I don't know
how to explain it,

01:27:50.667 --> 01:27:53.627
but the game means
everything to me.

01:27:56.125 --> 01:27:58.205
But I'll miss everything.

01:27:59.667 --> 01:28:00.957
- She'll miss you.

01:28:03.292 --> 01:28:04.962
I'm gonna miss you.

01:28:44.875 --> 01:28:47.995
- Here, this is
for your journey.

01:28:48.042 --> 01:28:50.252
As you know, when we make bread,

01:28:50.292 --> 01:28:52.172
we don't think of anything else,

01:28:52.208 --> 01:28:54.208
the bread is all that exists,

01:28:54.250 --> 01:28:57.830
it is also the same
with golf, is it true?

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.080
- Yes, pappous, it's true.

01:29:01.125 --> 01:29:03.285
It's the soul of the game.

01:29:14.083 --> 01:29:16.173
- Okay, you two.

01:29:16.208 --> 01:29:17.538
It's time to go.

01:29:20.625 --> 01:29:23.075
Have a good trip!

01:29:23.167 --> 01:29:24.957
Bye!

01:29:27.708 --> 01:29:28.708
Take care, Zoe!

01:29:28.750 --> 01:29:29.920
Don't forget us.

01:29:30.750 --> 01:29:32.710
Come back soon!

01:29:32.792 --> 01:29:35.002
Have a safe trip!

01:30:10.333 --> 01:30:12.753
- Could you pull over
for a second, please?

01:30:12.792 --> 01:30:14.962
Just right up here.

01:30:30.458 --> 01:30:32.998
Could you pop the trunk, please?

01:30:52.083 --> 01:30:53.793
When friends are
about to be separated,

01:30:53.833 --> 01:30:55.833
it's a golf custom
that they make a wish

01:30:55.875 --> 01:30:57.535
and hit balls at the same time,

01:30:57.583 --> 01:31:01.293
so they cross each other in
the sky and Grant our wishes.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:03.500
- It grants wishes?

01:31:05.125 --> 01:31:06.915
- That's what my
father always said.

01:31:07.208 --> 01:31:08.878
- When will you be back?

01:31:09.292 --> 01:31:11.582
- As soon as the
tour season's over,

01:31:11.625 --> 01:31:14.125
so no more skipping school
like you did today, okay?

01:31:14.167 --> 01:31:15.877
- Okay.

01:31:15.917 --> 01:31:17.497
- Otherwise your dad's
not gonna let you

01:31:17.542 --> 01:31:20.832
help me run my next
clinic and I need you.

01:31:21.167 --> 01:31:22.667
- Okay, I promise.

01:31:27.625 --> 01:31:30.745
- Remember when you asked me
what my favorite course was?

01:31:30.792 --> 01:31:33.582
- Yes, you said it
was always changing.

01:31:34.833 --> 01:31:36.003
- Not anymore.

01:32:00.792 --> 01:32:03.542
- One day, we will
never be separated.

01:32:05.458 --> 01:32:07.208
- How is that?

01:32:07.250 --> 01:32:09.750
- When I turn pro,
you can be my caddie.

01:32:09.875 --> 01:32:13.455
- Ah, I see, you
better pay me well.

01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:17.210
- Half of what I get and
i will never fire you.

01:32:17.250 --> 01:32:19.080
- Caddie for life, huh?

01:32:19.125 --> 01:32:21.625
- Well, we'll be like partners

01:32:21.667 --> 01:32:23.997
except I will get
all the trophies.

01:32:24.958 --> 01:32:26.078
- Partners.

01:32:26.958 --> 01:32:28.078
I like that.

01:32:32.375 --> 01:32:33.535
Okay, ready?

01:32:38.375 --> 01:32:40.205
Now, close your eyes.
