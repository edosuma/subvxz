00:13.740 --> 00:16.059
Caroline, there's been another explosion.

00:16.100 --> 00:16.780
Chicago.

00:17.740 --> 00:20.500
- What you got there, Bob?
- Burnt wire, I guess.

00:20.980 --> 00:23.780
So, underground wires
seemingly spontaneously combust.

00:24.020 --> 00:26.100
CIA got intercepts
of a plan to create a blackout

00:26.140 --> 00:29.140
and use the chaos to move terrorists
from Canada to the U.S.

00:29.300 --> 00:30.100
Right, blame Canada!

00:30.220 --> 00:31.820
You know who's really happy
about this blackout?

00:31.820 --> 00:32.420
Who?

00:32.460 --> 00:35.500
That guy on death row who was
supposed to get the chair this morning.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.980
You don't understand, this is
a government operated lab I'm in now.

00:38.180 --> 00:40.460
Just think of it.
Your own line of perfumes.

00:41.940 --> 00:43.660
You have a new bacterium,

00:43.820 --> 00:46.220
that became the amazing plastic-eating
red goo

00:46.380 --> 00:48.540
that took out the entire northeast
of the continent.

00:48.700 --> 00:50.700
Think of all the plastic in
all those garbage dumps.

00:50.860 --> 00:52.860
Now, you tweak this thing
and learn how to control it,

00:53.060 --> 00:53.780
it'll be worth a mint.

00:53.900 --> 00:56.980
Developed in a government-sponsored lab?
I wouldn't buy the Rolls just yet, Dave.

00:57.420 --> 00:59.060
Mick? Mick?

00:59.860 --> 01:01.220
I saw him dying, mum.

01:03.140 --> 01:04.340
I held him.

01:05.780 --> 01:07.460
You have got to turn all of this

01:08.020 --> 01:09.060
into a good memory,

01:10.940 --> 01:13.380
but you're not going to be
able to do that here.

01:14.820 --> 01:16.900
You need to be in the place
that you know.

01:17.580 --> 01:19.540
And with a mom
that you know.

02:55.100 --> 02:57.140
1x09- The Secret War

03:04.700 --> 03:06.900
Carlos, I need your medical report
on Justin Ricci.

03:07.060 --> 03:08.380
- In your "in" basket.
- Thank you.

03:08.500 --> 03:11.260
David, that global issues report
for the National Academy of Sciences.

03:11.420 --> 03:12.820
In my "in" basket.

03:13.060 --> 03:15.420
I'm only bothering you
because they're bothering me.

03:15.700 --> 03:17.580
- Monday.
- You're all witnesses.

03:18.260 --> 03:20.780
Now what about this haemophilia issue
in Mexico?

03:21.340 --> 03:23.620
In the Southern Mexican district
of Campeche,

03:23.660 --> 03:25.020
a serious incidence pattern.

03:25.460 --> 03:27.100
Incidence pattern
for haemophilia?

03:27.500 --> 03:30.300
- It's not a contagious disease.
- It's unusual.

03:30.660 --> 03:34.020
Could this be some kind of acquired
haemophilia? Isn't that possible?

03:34.180 --> 03:36.660
It's very rare.
Usually it emerges in the elderly.

03:36.740 --> 03:38.100
This is hitting all ages

03:38.220 --> 03:40.780
and the disease is ranging
over a very large area.

03:41.020 --> 03:42.980
Okay, well Mexico hasn't asked
for any help yet,

03:43.220 --> 03:45.020
but let's keep it on our radar.

03:45.500 --> 03:47.180
Okay, our lawyers in Washington tell us

03:47.420 --> 03:50.580
Specific North Wire & Cable is
questioning our science

03:51.380 --> 03:54.020
to the tune of a $125,000,000 suit.

03:54.340 --> 03:56.780
When the lawsuit hits a billion,
I'm taking everybody to dinner.

03:56.820 --> 03:58.020
To a soup kitchen.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.780
At least Homeland Security
was happy with our work.

04:01.140 --> 04:03.260
They wrote us, "Dear Ms. Morrison,
on behalf of all us... "

04:03.420 --> 04:05.540
Can you just put it on a
bulletin board?

04:07.540 --> 04:10.300
I hate bullshit letters.

04:10.380 --> 04:11.340
I'm sorry.

04:12.740 --> 04:14.100
We'll save Jill the stress.

04:14.700 --> 04:17.260
That's it, unless someone
else has anything...

04:17.500 --> 04:19.500
Oh, okay. This
is really interesting.

04:19.700 --> 04:22.460
I read about it on sciencesucks. com.

04:23.020 --> 04:24.900
What? They have some great
stuff on there.

04:25.100 --> 04:26.420
They are lunatics, Mayko.

04:26.580 --> 04:27.740
Just hear me out.

04:27.980 --> 04:31.100
In the Iraq war this company,
Battle Support Services -

04:31.260 --> 04:33.860
the Pentagon outsources a lot
of the grunt work

04:33.980 --> 04:36.820
so it doesn't look like it has
too many soldiers overseas, right -

04:36.820 --> 04:41.220
so Battle Support Services hired a group
of poor, mostly minority Americans

04:41.460 --> 04:43.220
to do clean up work at the base
in Kirkuk.

04:43.420 --> 04:45.940
One team, CC3 was sent to
do hazardous waste removal

04:46.140 --> 04:47.620
at a bombed out site in the south.

04:47.860 --> 04:48.860
I read about this somewhere.

04:49.180 --> 04:52.940
Various members of the crew came down
with lots of different ailments.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.500
Yup. Almost a third of them.

04:54.540 --> 04:57.140
Everything from joint pain to
asthma to serious hair loss.

04:57.340 --> 05:00.140
- All hair loss is serious.
- I've been briefed on this case, Mayko.

05:01.140 --> 05:02.340
Two sets of doctors concluded that

05:02.340 --> 05:04.420
their conditions were unrelated
to one another

05:04.420 --> 05:05.780
and to their duties in Iraq.

05:05.980 --> 05:08.060
Yeah, but they gave no explanation
as to what is making them sick.

05:08.380 --> 05:11.820
Mayko, the complaints over Gulf War
Syndrome are still stalled in the courts.

05:11.980 --> 05:14.180
- It's not our mandate.
- Yeah, well what is?

05:14.340 --> 05:15.460
- These!
- Are we through?

05:15.500 --> 05:15.940
Yes.

05:20.220 --> 05:21.060
Excuse me, David.

05:32.780 --> 05:34.140
What were their symptoms?

05:34.340 --> 05:36.500
Mostly CNS, some autoimmune.

05:36.820 --> 05:38.180
This is the background,

05:38.380 --> 05:39.100
and this.

05:39.460 --> 05:41.260
And this.

05:42.580 --> 05:44.180
And you better read this too.

05:47.340 --> 05:48.460
Who's this?

05:48.860 --> 05:50.500
Louisa Raposa their spokesperson.

05:50.660 --> 05:53.300
I talked to her. She's really cool.
I'd like to get her up here.

05:53.500 --> 05:56.060
Two sets of doctors said our illness
had nothing to do with Iraq.

05:56.500 --> 05:59.020
One hired by Battle Support and
one by the Pentagon.

06:11.060 --> 06:11.940
Jill.

06:12.260 --> 06:13.340
Hey, Jill!

06:13.580 --> 06:15.580
You okay? You seem a little tense.

06:15.780 --> 06:16.860
I'm fine. I'm fine.

06:17.020 --> 06:18.140
What's up?

06:18.460 --> 06:20.460
Well, uh... okay.

06:20.700 --> 06:23.500
I spent 3 years

06:23.740 --> 06:27.260
working on the mechanism of immediate
early transcription responses

06:27.420 --> 06:29.580
to hep-C infection of macrophages.

06:29.660 --> 06:30.980
Okay.
It doesn't matter.

06:31.220 --> 06:34.140
I published my findings

06:34.460 --> 06:35.580
and now some...

06:37.420 --> 06:40.940
these lab techs they can't reproduce
my experiment

06:41.260 --> 06:43.700
and they're claiming I was working
from the wrong cell line.

06:43.700 --> 06:44.620
Now, they're full of shit.

06:44.740 --> 06:46.460
They're just looking too far
after the infection.

06:46.900 --> 06:48.460
Okay, what can you do about it?

06:48.860 --> 06:49.820
I can prove them wrong

06:49.980 --> 06:52.140
by repeating my experiment with
a different cell line.

06:52.460 --> 06:53.660
Can we help you?

06:53.820 --> 06:55.260
Yeah, I need 3 weeks off.

06:56.700 --> 06:57.940
Please, I need it.

06:58.180 --> 06:59.460
We are swamped.

06:59.820 --> 07:00.620
I know.

07:00.700 --> 07:01.780
I need it.

07:05.100 --> 07:07.420
Okay, let me talk to David.

07:08.020 --> 07:10.540
Maybe someone else can do the grunt work
on your experiment.

07:10.860 --> 07:13.660
Okay, we'll work something out. Okay?

07:14.340 --> 07:15.260
Okay, thank you.

07:29.620 --> 07:31.020
Where'd you come from?

07:31.220 --> 07:32.780
The door. It was open.

07:33.140 --> 07:34.340
Right. What's up?

07:35.140 --> 07:36.740
- Can I talk to you?
- You are.

07:40.980 --> 07:43.980
I've been offered a senior position
in another lab.

07:44.500 --> 07:45.420
Again?

07:45.580 --> 07:47.300
This one's really serious, David.

07:47.460 --> 07:48.540
Camico Cosmetics.

07:48.820 --> 07:50.300
A senior position.
Actually, the senior position

07:50.300 --> 07:52.220
in their perfume lab.

07:55.380 --> 07:56.460
You're kidding?

07:58.060 --> 07:59.580
Well, that's great, Bob.

08:00.460 --> 08:02.020
Yeah. That's great, David.

08:03.460 --> 08:04.260
Yeah.

08:05.380 --> 08:09.300
So, I guess you've got some big
decisions to make, eh?

08:10.060 --> 08:13.220
I think I should take it
because it's what I've always wanted,

08:13.380 --> 08:15.500
- but I don't want to abandon you.
- Sure.

08:18.460 --> 08:19.900
- You think so?
- What?

08:20.180 --> 08:24.140
No. I mean, it's your decision, Bob.
I won't hold you back.

08:24.380 --> 08:26.020
If you don't think it's a good idea...

08:26.140 --> 08:27.460
I didn't say that.

08:28.060 --> 08:32.580
Bob, what do you love more
than anything else in the whole world?

08:36.179 --> 08:37.940
Working with you.

08:40.100 --> 08:41.500
What else, Bob?

08:42.220 --> 08:43.860
My dog.

08:44.340 --> 08:45.860
What else?

08:46.180 --> 08:47.380
Perfume.

08:47.540 --> 08:49.300
Well, the science of it.

08:49.620 --> 08:50.780
There you go.

08:51.220 --> 08:53.660
So, you know,

08:53.860 --> 08:55.540
you go think about it,

08:55.740 --> 08:58.340
and let me know what you decide.

09:00.060 --> 09:01.220
Of course.

09:03.380 --> 09:05.300
Thank you for your time.

09:22.180 --> 09:24.460
I have a hair appointment
on Saturday.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.340
If my hair's going to fall out anyway...

09:26.380 --> 09:27.460
Keep the appointment.

09:27.540 --> 09:30.260
You'll want to look good for a night
of celebrating.

09:30.300 --> 09:32.460
There's no cancer, Caroline.

09:35.540 --> 09:36.660
Oh, that's good news.

09:38.260 --> 09:40.140
What is it exactly that you found?

09:40.300 --> 09:41.820
Oh, nothing. Nothing to worry about,

09:42.380 --> 09:43.860
except that blood pressure.

09:44.140 --> 09:46.140
Oh, take it again. I'm fine now.

09:46.500 --> 09:47.740
Really.

10:05.740 --> 10:07.060
I'm leaving, Jill.

10:07.300 --> 10:08.300
Bye.

10:13.820 --> 10:14.540
Good morning.

10:14.700 --> 10:15.500
Good morning, Bob.

10:18.500 --> 10:19.020
Hey.

10:19.220 --> 10:20.340
Hey, where were you?

10:20.500 --> 10:21.260
Dentist.

10:21.340 --> 10:24.220
Do you know about this thing with Jill,
her experiment?

10:24.460 --> 10:25.700
Yeah. It's glory theft.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.580
Somebody jumps on top of a breakthrough

10:28.780 --> 10:31.660
and they scream and shout that it's fake
and get all the publicity.

10:31.820 --> 10:34.180
Eventually they're going to be proven wrong
and 5 years down the road

10:34.380 --> 10:37.660
the only thing anyone's going to remember
are the names of the brave dissenters.

10:38.100 --> 10:39.940
She wants 3 weeks off to disprove them.

10:40.260 --> 10:42.580
It'll take a month, and then
they'll just bring up some other points.

10:42.740 --> 10:45.060
These guys live by being assholes.
It'll never end.

10:45.260 --> 10:46.500
So, what can we do?

10:46.660 --> 10:47.780
There's nothing we do really.

10:47.900 --> 10:50.580
She's got a reputation to defend.
She's not going to walk away from this.

10:51.060 --> 10:52.500
Can we do without her for a month?

10:52.820 --> 10:53.500
Nope.

10:55.380 --> 10:56.740
Oh, let me get that, Mayko.

11:00.940 --> 11:03.940
Okay, Louisa Raposa, say hello
to Dr. David Sandstrom.

11:04.300 --> 11:06.900
I had enough sandstorms in Iraq,
so I'll call you David.

11:07.100 --> 11:07.940
Yeah, absolutely.

11:08.580 --> 11:09.660
Uh, right this way.

11:11.060 --> 11:13.260
Oh, thanks for the help with the boxes, David.

11:13.980 --> 11:15.940
When they bussed us down to Imam,

11:15.980 --> 11:18.420
this 2-bit town near the salt
ponds in the south...

11:19.380 --> 11:22.980
they gave us hazmat suits, we spent a week
loading out these bombed out buildings,

11:23.220 --> 11:26.140
even the dirt under them,
into these big biohazard barrels.

11:26.340 --> 11:27.260
What was in the buildings?

11:27.700 --> 11:30.300
Iraqi military supplies.
They wouldn't tell us more.

11:30.580 --> 11:32.460
And then we loaded the barrels
onto these C-135s

11:32.660 --> 11:35.260
and I heard they were dropped
into the Persian Gulf.

11:35.540 --> 11:36.540
Who told you that?

11:36.540 --> 11:38.460
I got drunk with the navigator
a couple times.

11:38.660 --> 11:39.660
Oh, yeah? Handsome?

11:40.180 --> 11:42.420
Yeah, handsome.
Yeah, you would have liked her.

11:43.340 --> 11:44.780
No one told you what
the danger was?

11:45.660 --> 11:48.660
Well, we weren't military.
We were civs, so no one told us shit.

11:48.860 --> 11:52.140
We were doing dangerous work with
no security and no pension, no future.

11:52.340 --> 11:54.380
Now 10 of us are fucking dying.

11:54.620 --> 11:55.620
One is dead.

11:56.180 --> 11:57.300
My friend...

11:58.780 --> 11:59.740
Antonio Santos.

12:00.140 --> 12:03.060
The private firm that hired
you dismissed your claim as specious.

12:03.580 --> 12:06.820
- If specious means bullshit.
- What's your ailment, Louisa?

12:07.620 --> 12:09.180
Migraines, dizziness,

12:10.180 --> 12:11.820
I have very little feeling in my legs.

12:12.140 --> 12:14.700
I mean, I can walk
but it's a pain in the ass...

12:15.180 --> 12:16.180
both cheeks.

12:16.380 --> 12:18.060
Do you have an official diagnosis?

12:18.380 --> 12:19.700
Just symptoms.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.940
And I suppose without
independent medical substantiation

12:22.140 --> 12:23.820
you can't get a lawyer to take your case.

12:24.300 --> 12:25.580
None of our cases.

12:27.420 --> 12:29.340
So, are you going to help
us out or what?

12:30.220 --> 12:33.020
Well, let me get back to you on that.
Can you hang around Toronto for awhile?

12:33.420 --> 12:34.820
Yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah.
Put me up at the Ritz,

12:35.060 --> 12:37.780
gimme a key to the mini-bar and
I can stay as long as you like.

12:38.060 --> 12:40.180
Well, it may not be the Ritz,
but I've got a fold out sofa

12:40.420 --> 12:41.820
and a fridge full of Molson Canadian.

12:42.020 --> 12:44.340
You know what?
Why don't we go raid my fridge first?

12:50.060 --> 12:52.100
Welcome to my other office.

12:57.540 --> 12:59.500
So, where's the beer?

12:59.740 --> 13:01.420
I'll get the beers, you read.

13:13.300 --> 13:13.980
Thanks.

13:34.620 --> 13:35.820
Jesus.

13:36.980 --> 13:39.340
Pretty amazing symptomatology, huh?

13:42.860 --> 13:44.940
It's going to be impossible to prove.

13:47.140 --> 13:49.260
So, we better get started.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.100
Get off me!

13:54.140 --> 13:55.540
- Thank you.
- Sure.

14:14.980 --> 14:16.900
You and Carlos
get the investigation started.

14:17.060 --> 14:19.140
- What do we say to Caroline?
- You don't say anything.

14:19.300 --> 14:20.620
Well, try not to swear at her.

14:20.780 --> 14:22.340
I don't think she responds
to your swearing.

14:22.460 --> 14:23.300
Thank you for the advice.

14:30.100 --> 14:31.900
Hey, Jill. Have you seen Carlos?

14:35.420 --> 14:38.540
Do you want me to bring you in
a change of clothes?

14:41.620 --> 14:43.780
I just had sex with an albino midget.

14:43.780 --> 14:45.580
- Pretty cool, huh?
- What?

15:10.740 --> 15:13.340
I don't think she responds
to your swearing.

15:13.540 --> 15:14.620
Thank you for the advice.

15:21.740 --> 15:23.540
All right, where do we get
our funding from?

15:23.780 --> 15:25.140
- Hello, David.
- Yeah, hi.

15:25.260 --> 15:29.140
You say 3 governments: Mexico,
the USA and Canada, and then I say no,

15:29.500 --> 15:33.300
we get our funding from the
people who pay taxes to

15:33.300 --> 15:34.460
the governments of Mexico, the USA
and Canada.

15:35.060 --> 15:36.260
It's a waste of time.

15:36.820 --> 15:37.820
Ten sick, 1 dead.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.700
Yeah, but not dead because
of a disease.

15:40.100 --> 15:42.860
Antonio Santos jumped off the
George Washington Bridge.

15:43.060 --> 15:44.740
- Because he was sick.
- In the head.

15:45.140 --> 15:46.420
He had a history of depression.

15:46.620 --> 15:49.140
The U.S. military cannot
assume any responsibility.

15:50.540 --> 15:52.100
I must have heard that 50 times.

15:52.260 --> 15:54.700
Who doesn't have depression
when you're dirt poor?

15:54.820 --> 15:56.660
He came back from Iraq
with fibromyalgia.

15:56.700 --> 15:58.300
He couldn't sleep. He couldn't work.

15:58.380 --> 15:59.660
But he has insurance

15:59.700 --> 16:02.220
and the day before it expired
he killed himself so his kids could eat.

16:02.380 --> 16:05.900
His insurance policy was for $10,000.
How desperate is that?

16:06.100 --> 16:07.780
We don't investigate
depression.

16:08.140 --> 16:10.060
We investigate
questionable science.

16:11.940 --> 16:14.580
He died in the Hudson
but something killed him in Iraq

16:15.140 --> 16:16.500
and that's our mandate.

16:22.060 --> 16:24.660
Why is this something that
only NorBAC can solve?

16:24.780 --> 16:26.940
I'm not even sure
it's something we can solve.

16:27.180 --> 16:29.420
These people have had their
case studied twice.

16:29.620 --> 16:31.820
Both medical reports say all
the symptoms are grey.

16:32.260 --> 16:33.380
Everything's grey.

16:33.740 --> 16:35.460
We need some black and white.

16:36.460 --> 16:38.340
Just give me 72 hours
to make our case.

16:40.780 --> 16:41.420
24.

16:42.500 --> 16:43.460
- 48.
-24.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.500
- 72.
- 24!

16:45.660 --> 16:47.260
Hmm, I'm beginning to detect
a pattern here.

16:48.100 --> 16:49.940
Okay, 24 it is.

16:50.860 --> 16:53.860
- Well, that's three 8-hour days, right?
- David!

16:55.780 --> 16:58.340
Well, that makes sense. The pot
would have helped a lot with his pain.

16:59.140 --> 17:00.940
Uh, do you have his address?

17:03.780 --> 17:05.420
Is there a phone number there?

17:08.099 --> 17:11.380
Yeah.

17:12.339 --> 17:13.380
Right.

17:13.859 --> 17:15.380
Okay. Thanks. Bye.

17:16.460 --> 17:18.140
- Thomas found a home.
- Well, that's good.

17:18.819 --> 17:20.900
San Quentin. Three strikes.
Pot possession.

17:22.540 --> 17:25.380
What did Caroline say?
Is she protecting her Pentagon pals?

17:25.579 --> 17:27.859
No. We've got 24 hours to give her
one good reason as to

17:27.980 --> 17:29.380
why we should be allowed to pursue this.

17:29.500 --> 17:30.900
- We'll give her 11.
- Atta girl.

17:31.860 --> 17:33.940
Hi, is that Rita? This is Mayko Tran.

17:34.860 --> 17:36.380
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Louisa's friend.

17:37.300 --> 17:40.980
North American Biotechnology
Advisory Commission.

17:41.180 --> 17:42.740
I didn't make it up.

17:43.460 --> 17:46.460
Okay, look I need to know if you got
the lab results.

17:52.660 --> 17:53.780
Hey, how's it going?

17:53.940 --> 17:54.540
Hey.

17:55.500 --> 17:58.660
So, I looked at the haematology
reports from the 11 victims.

18:00.260 --> 18:04.660
The blood is a bouillabaisse of antibodies
for dozens of ruses and bacteria.

18:04.820 --> 18:07.780
Yeah, Louisa said they got all inoculated
before they left to Iraq, so...

18:07.900 --> 18:08.700
Maybe that's it.

18:08.900 --> 18:10.980
No, no, no. Everyone who went to Iraq
got those.

18:11.100 --> 18:13.180
We need to find something
specic to the victims.

18:13.620 --> 18:16.380
They're suffering, but from so
many syndromes and symptom clusters

18:17.260 --> 18:19.300
it's impossible for me
to tease out a single cause.

18:19.940 --> 18:21.100
I'm going to need...

18:22.020 --> 18:25.580
urine samples, stool samples,
throat swabs.

18:26.060 --> 18:27.580
- Talk to Mayko.
- Yeah, I did.

18:27.900 --> 18:30.380
We're between a rock and
you-know-who's hard ass, so...

18:30.980 --> 18:31.980
Work fast.

18:32.660 --> 18:34.580
Hey, I saw that Bob was packed.

18:34.980 --> 18:36.740
Uh, yeah. He got a new job offer.

18:36.980 --> 18:37.860
He's leaving us?

18:38.020 --> 18:40.460
No, no, no. He'll talk himself out of it
in a little while.

18:40.620 --> 18:41.620
He's done this before.

18:41.740 --> 18:43.780
David, did you try talking
him out of it?

18:44.580 --> 18:45.220
No,

18:45.420 --> 18:48.300
you can't put emotional pressure
on people like Bob.

18:48.700 --> 18:50.100
You know, don't worry about it.

18:50.260 --> 18:52.700
He'll start thinking about this
new lab and new people...

18:53.660 --> 18:56.100
Bob isn't good with "new,"
he'll come around.

19:00.420 --> 19:02.740
We mainly did janitorial
work at the base.

19:02.820 --> 19:04.820
The cleanup at Hamar is
the only time we left.

19:04.940 --> 19:06.660
But you and your crew were the
only ones who got sick?

19:06.820 --> 19:09.100
Yeah. Only ones that left,
only ones that got sick.

19:12.740 --> 19:14.260
What about the suits?

19:16.620 --> 19:18.860
I mean... could the hazmat suits
have been faulty?

19:19.140 --> 19:22.540
No, the gear was cool, you know.
It fit well, it didn't weigh much.

19:22.860 --> 19:24.060
Maybe they were torn.

19:24.260 --> 19:25.820
No, no, no, no,
the stuff didn't tear.

19:25.860 --> 19:28.300
It was like
it was made of kryptonite or something.

19:28.580 --> 19:29.420
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:30.460 --> 19:33.460
Yeah? May, where the hell are you?
I've got an emu waiting for you.

19:34.780 --> 19:35.980
It figures.

19:36.740 --> 19:38.260
Yeah. No, no, no, take your time.

19:39.060 --> 19:39.700
Bye.

19:40.580 --> 19:44.100
Mayko has been held up at the lab.
She will be here in a little bit.

19:45.060 --> 19:47.220
Uh, what is this exactly?

19:47.700 --> 19:48.700
Uh, emu.

19:49.540 --> 19:50.820
It's a big bird.

19:50.980 --> 19:54.060
We're eating Big Bird, ooh.
Tummy English.

19:54.780 --> 19:56.020
All right, it's August,

19:56.300 --> 19:58.820
in Hamar, in southern Iraq.
What was the daily temperature?

19:58.980 --> 20:01.700
It was over 115,
but the suits were air-conditioned.

20:01.860 --> 20:03.420
Your suits were air-conditioned?
How?

20:03.620 --> 20:04.860
Yeah. I don't know.

20:05.180 --> 20:07.740
Ha! What about an air supply?
Did you have a filtration mask?

20:07.780 --> 20:09.340
No, air tanks.

20:09.620 --> 20:12.580
They gave us a new tank every hour
and there were no masks.

20:12.780 --> 20:15.700
- It was like one piece.
- I gotta see one of these suits.

20:17.100 --> 20:18.780
Well, I gotta say they don't...

20:19.020 --> 20:22.020
they don't cook like this is
North Bergen, New Jersey.

20:22.180 --> 20:24.300
Ah, well, I bet you say that
to all the boys.

20:25.700 --> 20:27.500
So how did a resident from
the Garden State

20:27.660 --> 20:30.060
end up cleaning up
after the parade in Iraq?

20:30.660 --> 20:32.820
I don't know. Where I come from,
you don't get tons of choice.

20:33.340 --> 20:36.220
Um, the money was good,
they paid room and board

20:36.580 --> 20:39.420
and I thought I could help my country
and come home with a stash of cash.

20:40.940 --> 20:44.020
Uh, you wanna know why else?

20:44.660 --> 20:45.660
Why?

20:46.740 --> 20:48.940
I had never been on a plane before.

20:49.500 --> 20:50.900
Really?

20:51.380 --> 20:52.900
- It's pitiful, huh?
- No, no.

20:53.780 --> 20:55.420
I had never actually been
outside of America.

20:55.860 --> 20:57.420
- Well, welcome to Canada.
- Thank you.

20:59.980 --> 21:02.060
Are you a typical Canadian?

21:03.020 --> 21:05.140
No, some of us are really
quite nice.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.180
Mmm, you're a good cook, too.

21:10.380 --> 21:11.740
And I give a great massage.

21:22.620 --> 21:23.500
Here you go.

21:28.660 --> 21:30.660
Did you spend the night
here again?

21:31.940 --> 21:33.300
Do you have

21:33.580 --> 21:34.580
the results

21:34.820 --> 21:36.540
of the PCR?

21:37.060 --> 21:38.660
- Oh.
- "Oh" what?

21:39.340 --> 21:41.420
"Oh" I forgot all about it.

21:41.980 --> 21:43.740
Oh. Do you need a coffee?

21:50.980 --> 21:52.260
- Hey!
- Good morning.

21:52.820 --> 21:54.260
Sorry I couldn't make it out last night.

21:55.060 --> 21:56.820
-  How did it go?
- Good.

21:57.140 --> 21:57.940
Yeah?

21:58.340 --> 22:01.700
Last night after she came home,
she asked me what your sign was,

22:01.900 --> 22:06.100
and I thought:
"Ouh, caution, stop! Dead end."

22:06.220 --> 22:07.820
Slippery when wet.

22:08.580 --> 22:10.540
Louisa seemed to think you might be
on to something.

22:10.700 --> 22:13.060
We talked a lot about hazmat suits
and air tanks.

22:13.580 --> 22:14.820
Is that all?

22:15.060 --> 22:18.820
No, actually, we came up with
a great idea for a new reality TV series:

22:19.100 --> 22:22.420
Lab Romance. What do you think?
Riveting, huh?

22:23.140 --> 22:24.500
I want one of those suits.

22:24.860 --> 22:26.380
Can't. I already looked into it.

22:26.820 --> 22:28.580
The U.S. military will not discuss it.

22:28.780 --> 22:31.100
They won't even admit they exist.

22:31.420 --> 22:32.820
I'll take care of that.
What have you got?

22:33.100 --> 22:34.740
I got a tip off ScienceSucks

22:34.940 --> 22:37.660
on how to tap the U.N.'s Iraqi monitoring
commission satellite photos

22:37.700 --> 22:41.300
and inspection records
from 1994 to 2002. Look.

22:41.980 --> 22:44.660
So these are the photos Bush
and the boys ignored, eh?

22:44.820 --> 22:47.020
- Somebody's gotta use them.
- Exactly.

22:47.300 --> 22:49.140
In the 1980's, the site of Hamar
was suspected of being

22:49.380 --> 22:52.420
a biochemical warfare
manufacturing facility.

22:52.700 --> 22:56.340
This is the site now and this is the site
before it was cleaned up.

22:57.140 --> 22:59.580
Looks a lot like
a bunch of bombed-out buildings.

22:59.860 --> 23:01.580
And before it was bombed.

23:02.300 --> 23:03.660
Not much of a difference.

23:03.700 --> 23:06.660
- It was falling apart.
- Why did the Americans bomb it?

23:06.700 --> 23:08.700
Good question. Check this out.

23:09.300 --> 23:11.060
It's when it was built, in 1983.

23:11.300 --> 23:14.060
- Yeah, so?
- They're U.S. military prefab buildings.

23:14.340 --> 23:16.940
- Okay.
- So Americans built them.

23:17.100 --> 23:19.700
Weren't the Americans supporting Iraq
against Iran, back then?

23:19.820 --> 23:22.180
Strangely, even though Iraq
initiated the war.

23:22.420 --> 23:25.620
Look, what if they bombed it because

23:25.820 --> 23:28.180
there were biological weapons of
mass destruction there?

23:28.340 --> 23:31.460
If the Americans found even
one of Saddam's WMD's,

23:31.500 --> 23:33.340
Bush would've been spitting it
until re-election.

23:33.620 --> 23:36.540
Not Iraqi WMD's, American.

23:36.620 --> 23:38.700
It's a known fact
that the U.S. supplied Saddam

23:38.740 --> 23:40.980
with biological and chemical
weapons in the 80's.

23:41.340 --> 23:43.420
All right. We'd better keep
Louisa around for a few more days,

23:43.740 --> 23:45.820
then, answer a few more questions.

23:46.860 --> 23:47.700
Business.

23:47.860 --> 23:49.180
- Of course.
- Go away.

23:50.300 --> 23:51.980
Carlos, you got anything
on Louisa's physio?

23:52.460 --> 23:53.580
Uh... On my desk.

23:53.740 --> 23:54.860
Anything jump out?

23:55.220 --> 23:59.220
Yes. Triglycerides are too high,
because Louisa likes to drink.

23:59.380 --> 24:00.860
How'd you find that out?

24:00.980 --> 24:01.540
She told me.

24:01.980 --> 24:04.900
Liver's a little swollen,
probably the reason for her joint pain.

24:05.340 --> 24:07.260
Her Eustachian tubes
were clogged.

24:07.420 --> 24:09.420
Probably the reason
for her dizziness.

24:09.660 --> 24:12.860
You don't think any of this has to do
with what happened to her in Iraq?

24:13.100 --> 24:15.420
I trust what the initial
doctors diagnosed.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.660
Besides, I think we have more
serious priorities.

24:17.820 --> 24:18.420
Like?

24:19.500 --> 24:21.100
Like this haemophilia in Mexico.

24:21.940 --> 24:23.460
David, 9 people are dead.

24:23.780 --> 24:25.580
Haemophilia is not
a contagious disease.

24:25.660 --> 24:27.540
I know, I know, but somehow,
this thing is spreading.

24:27.740 --> 24:30.540
People are bleeding to death on
their way to the hospital.

24:30.780 --> 24:32.300
- It doesn't make any sense.
- I agree.

24:32.540 --> 24:33.540
All right, I'll get on it.

24:34.660 --> 24:36.780
Ah, thank you. Let's not drop the ball
on Louisa, though.

24:36.940 --> 24:37.620
Okay.

24:38.500 --> 24:41.460
Jill, I'm gonna need you
to run some blood cultures for me.

24:41.900 --> 24:44.660
I'm gonna have some samples sent up
from Mexico, haemophilia patients.

24:44.860 --> 24:47.100
I want you to look for viral and bacterial
infection.

24:47.300 --> 24:49.100
- Are you listening to me?
- David, I'm busy.

24:49.260 --> 24:50.780
No, you're insane.
Knock it off.

24:52.820 --> 24:54.740
I know you've got a lot riding
on this hep-C infection,

24:54.900 --> 24:57.180
but there's other things going
on in this lab.

24:57.220 --> 24:59.740
- I know, I just need a couple more weeks.
- I need you now.

24:59.900 --> 25:01.380
- David, I can't.
- Yes, you can.

25:01.740 --> 25:02.900
No: yes, you will.

25:03.540 --> 25:04.700
Coffee.

25:07.940 --> 25:08.740
Thank you.

25:13.740 --> 25:15.380
I'm... sorry. No...

25:15.860 --> 25:18.180
Lo siento, no habla espanol.

25:18.820 --> 25:20.380
Look, I'm looking for...

25:21.500 --> 25:25.740
Could it be possible to get the medical
histories of all your immediate family?

25:27.220 --> 25:29.100
You're 114 people?

25:30.140 --> 25:31.820
Ha! Ha! In Porto Rico, okay.

25:32.300 --> 25:34.580
Well, could you e-mail me at
mayko@maykotran.com?

25:34.740 --> 25:37.740
Apparently your doctor never got
the fax releasing a file to us.

25:40.420 --> 25:43.860
Come on, we... we got the specimens
the lab sent, but we're missing...

25:46.460 --> 25:49.100
Yeah... No, she sounds pretty hungry.

25:49.900 --> 25:54.860
Um... look, why don't you give me a call
after you feed her, okay?

25:56.260 --> 25:57.420
Yeah. Thanks.

26:01.380 --> 26:04.660
Wow! Someone's been working.

26:04.900 --> 26:06.700
- I've barely started.
- Run me through it.

26:06.860 --> 26:09.940
- I'm not ready.
- I said 24 hours. It's been 36.

26:11.740 --> 26:12.460
Okay.

26:13.900 --> 26:15.780
Most of them are

26:15.900 --> 26:17.660
working class, immigrant, non-White,

26:17.700 --> 26:19.820
with poor access to
education and social services.

26:19.900 --> 26:21.820
Stick to the medical.

26:23.060 --> 26:24.460
Okay, look,

26:24.660 --> 26:28.300
each one of these guys passed exhaustive
and exhausting physical and medical tests

26:28.300 --> 26:30.100
before being shipped to the Gulf. It...

26:30.260 --> 26:32.060
They were in perfect health, you know?

26:32.060 --> 26:33.540
Now they have hardcore symptoms

26:33.580 --> 26:36.300
that can't be traced
to any known disease, virus or bacteria.

26:36.340 --> 26:40.020
And it's possible something in Iraq could
account for all these different symptoms?

26:40.180 --> 26:41.100
Yes and no.

26:41.100 --> 26:44.420
It's cause and effect:
do we have an effect?

26:44.700 --> 26:46.620
Well, a third of the people are
getting sick,

26:46.820 --> 26:50.740
and in each case, the symptoms present
themselves within 3 to 6 months of returning from Iraq.

26:50.860 --> 26:54.300
Now, biological and lifestyle factors
can't account for those odds.

26:54.500 --> 26:56.620
Take Rita and Benton:
they've lumps in their breasts.

26:57.140 --> 26:58.300
I never smoked.

26:58.300 --> 26:59.180
Me neither.

26:59.740 --> 27:01.500
No history of the disease.

27:01.500 --> 27:05.500
Me neither.
I'm gonna need a mastectomy.

27:05.660 --> 27:06.620
Double for me.

27:07.220 --> 27:08.380
No cause.

27:09.020 --> 27:11.740
We have to find something that
can trigger different symptoms.

27:15.260 --> 27:16.500
Are you okay?

27:17.020 --> 27:17.940
Yeah.

27:18.500 --> 27:19.860
I'm just tired.

27:20.540 --> 27:21.740
Any idea?

27:22.260 --> 27:23.060
None.

27:23.620 --> 27:25.740
I'm giving you a few more days.

27:25.780 --> 27:26.780
Oh.

27:27.660 --> 27:28.780
Good.

27:29.860 --> 27:31.580
Uh, 'cause I... I need your help.

27:32.420 --> 27:34.180
Um, I just spoke to a buddy of mine
over at Scripts,

27:34.300 --> 27:36.020
who works on soft material for
the space programme.

27:36.180 --> 27:38.260
And CC3 was using high-tech hazmat suits

27:38.460 --> 27:39.980
made by a company called
Shining Armor,

27:40.020 --> 27:42.980
which is weird, because the military
isn't even using these things yet,

27:43.140 --> 27:46.060
but Shining Armor refuses to admit
they built them

27:46.100 --> 27:50.740
and Battle Support Services refuses
to admit they were using them, so...

27:51.180 --> 27:53.660
Can... can you get us a suit?

27:54.980 --> 27:56.780
Make some phone calls?

27:57.460 --> 27:59.180
I'll make a House call.

28:01.620 --> 28:02.660
Oh. Thank you.

28:08.980 --> 28:11.460
If your dance card
opens up in September,

28:11.540 --> 28:14.700
I'll be taking the S.S. McGuinn
for a spin around the Caribbean.

28:15.300 --> 28:18.340
I could use a first mate
who knows her way around the rigging.

28:18.500 --> 28:20.940
NorBAC's been keeping me busy,
but you never know.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.620
Been doing some impressive work,
up there in Toronto.

28:23.660 --> 28:25.460
I've been working with some
impressive people.

28:25.620 --> 28:27.140
- Which brings you...
- Here, yes.

28:27.860 --> 28:28.980
What's the ruckus?

28:29.020 --> 28:33.380
CC3, the crew that was on cleanup detail
for Battle Support in southern Iraq.

28:34.220 --> 28:36.780
We're trying to get
to the bottom of their health problems.

28:37.900 --> 28:39.260
It's a compelling story.

28:39.340 --> 28:41.500
That 2 extensive medical studies
have put to rest.

28:41.580 --> 28:43.740
But no one denies
these people are sick.

28:43.860 --> 28:45.620
- But not from Iraq.
- Then from what?

28:46.340 --> 28:49.020
Fast food? The blight of the nation.

28:49.860 --> 28:51.940
But you believed there was enough
of a chance

28:52.140 --> 28:55.100
that something they were exposed
to in Iraq caused these illnesses.

28:56.100 --> 28:58.540
That's why you authorized
the military's medical study.

28:58.860 --> 29:01.820
They weren't exposed to anything.
They were using state-of-the-art hazmat gear.

29:02.060 --> 29:04.780
- First time in the field.
- Field-tested at Samuel for 6 months.

29:05.620 --> 29:06.780
Give me a suit.

29:06.940 --> 29:09.900
Let my people pick it apart.
If there's a flaw, we'll find it.

29:10.500 --> 29:12.540
You'll have full access to our results.

29:12.900 --> 29:14.500
Maybe you'll learn something.

29:15.180 --> 29:18.140
Thanks for the offer,
but we don't own the suit.

29:18.180 --> 29:21.100
It's property of Shining Armor.
Why don't you give them a call?

29:21.260 --> 29:22.100
I did.

29:22.220 --> 29:24.580
They sent me to you,
they said you paid for it.

29:25.340 --> 29:26.700
For them to develop it.

29:26.860 --> 29:29.620
Shining Armor owns the suit,
it's not mine to give away.

29:30.780 --> 29:32.540
Oh. So I guess the title,

29:32.700 --> 29:35.020
"director of research and engineering"
doesn't count for much.

29:35.060 --> 29:37.060
Just as small cog
in a big military machine.

29:38.500 --> 29:39.980
But let me save you some time:

29:40.500 --> 29:43.420
the suits are solid.
You can wear them on Mars.

29:44.180 --> 29:46.180
Okay, you've convinced me, I'll take one.

29:47.060 --> 29:49.660
The test data, Caroline.
Not the suit.

29:50.500 --> 29:52.540
We wanna do our own research.

29:53.100 --> 29:55.420
We might find something you missed.

29:56.140 --> 29:57.820
What are you afraid of?

29:58.220 --> 29:59.660
Besides you?

29:59.980 --> 30:01.500
Come on, Connor!

30:02.220 --> 30:05.460
The suit. Let me borrow it.

30:11.180 --> 30:12.220
Hey!

30:13.020 --> 30:14.260
Where were you all day?

30:14.420 --> 30:16.740
Shopping. I got you a present,

30:17.060 --> 30:18.100
something you can wear.

30:19.580 --> 30:20.780
Open it!

30:23.580 --> 30:25.020
Is this a joke present?

30:25.460 --> 30:27.700
I thought you said I didn't have
a sense of humour?

30:28.340 --> 30:30.980
- Did I say that to your face?
- I overheard you. Twice.

30:31.060 --> 30:32.820
- You gotta learn to ignore me.
- Don't worry.

30:38.340 --> 30:40.060
How did you get it?

30:40.620 --> 30:43.180
I... just said, "please. "

30:44.380 --> 30:45.820
Hardly weighs a thing.

30:46.820 --> 30:50.140
Looks like something Elvis used to wear.
What's it made of?

30:50.420 --> 30:52.540
Probably like 20 different materials.

30:55.180 --> 30:56.460
There's no tank?

30:56.620 --> 30:57.420
No.

31:01.580 --> 31:02.740
Thank you.

31:03.340 --> 31:04.580
You're welcome.

31:08.060 --> 31:10.820
Health officials in Mexico are now
asking us to look into the outbreak.

31:11.260 --> 31:12.580
They need help rapidissimo.

31:13.260 --> 31:15.380
I already asked them to send up
some blood samples.

31:15.620 --> 31:17.300
Anything show up yet, Jill?

31:18.060 --> 31:20.740
- Hmm? Uh, yes, we got them.
- Anything?

31:21.620 --> 31:24.220
I don't know, I haven't had
a chance to look at them yet.

31:25.380 --> 31:27.740
All right, I want you to drop whatever
you're doing and make this a priority.

31:29.300 --> 31:29.740
Jill?

31:30.300 --> 31:33.500
I... This isn't virology,
it's haematology.

31:33.700 --> 31:35.780
How many viruses do you know
cause internal bleeding?

31:37.060 --> 31:37.900
A few.

31:38.620 --> 31:42.700
Yeah. Haemophilia affects 1 in 10,000 men.
It's pretty rare in women.

31:43.020 --> 31:44.540
The father would have to have haemophilia

31:44.700 --> 31:46.540
and the mother be a carrier
or have it too.

31:47.140 --> 31:49.860
The bloodwork will let us know
if that's what we're dealing with.

31:50.260 --> 31:53.220
There are rare genetic mutations
where haemophilia suddenly occurs

31:53.420 --> 31:55.380
but unlikely in these numbers.

31:55.780 --> 31:57.020
What are we up to now?

31:57.180 --> 31:58.260
Fifteen dead.

31:58.580 --> 31:59.660
Jill?

31:59.940 --> 32:01.860
Yes. All right, I'm on it.

32:02.780 --> 32:03.660
And where's Bob?

32:03.820 --> 32:05.380
We're going to need his help
on the biochemistry.

32:05.660 --> 32:07.500
The suit is a C60 carbon atom,

32:07.500 --> 32:10.660
but it's spherically,
in a truncated icosahedron.

32:11.380 --> 32:14.300
Your basic Bucky ball about
1 nm in diameter.

32:14.540 --> 32:15.660
Bucky ball?

32:15.860 --> 32:19.500
They're the roundest and most symmetrical
large molecule known to man.

32:19.500 --> 32:20.580
They're beautiful.

32:21.100 --> 32:22.500
And they're made into nanofibres,

32:22.660 --> 32:24.860
which are like
a millionth of a centimetre wide

32:25.020 --> 32:26.580
and a thousandth of a centimetre long,

32:26.820 --> 32:28.660
and then they put those
together and...

32:28.900 --> 32:32.140
You know, this is one of the first
applications of industrial nanotechnology.

32:32.860 --> 32:35.460
You see, a Bucky ball is carbon,
like a diamond,

32:35.860 --> 32:37.340
but it's hollow, so it's light.

32:37.540 --> 32:39.460
And if you flatten it,
it bounces right back.

32:39.780 --> 32:41.340
Tell her about the heat loss.

32:41.540 --> 32:45.420
Oh, uh, you know how some
material leaks away moisture?

32:45.740 --> 32:47.980
Well, they've figured out a way
to use the hollows to put in a vapour

32:48.100 --> 32:50.660
that collects the heat
and transfers it out.

32:50.980 --> 32:52.460
Built-in air-conditioning.

32:52.660 --> 32:54.180
Is there anything it can't do?

32:54.380 --> 32:57.780
I had a dermatologist check it out:
all the materials are hypoallergenic.

32:58.140 --> 32:59.380
We've been checking the nanofibres

32:59.540 --> 33:02.060
to see if they cause chromosomal
mutations, but nothing yet.

33:02.260 --> 33:05.180
Bucky balls have been implicated
in the destruction of lipid cells in fish.

33:05.460 --> 33:06.420
Brain tissue?

33:06.580 --> 33:08.900
And they collect
in the liver and the kidneys.

33:09.700 --> 33:12.060
So what do you think: the crew absorbed
some of these...

33:12.260 --> 33:14.940
Bucky balls through their skin?

33:15.100 --> 33:17.260
It's unlikely. I mean, these things are
totally stable and incredibly insoluble,

33:17.420 --> 33:19.500
so you'd have to...
you'd have to eat them to get sick.

33:19.580 --> 33:22.100
So we have no evidence yet that
the suits are a problem.

33:22.180 --> 33:23.900
None at all. But they're so cool,
so the question is:

33:24.060 --> 33:28.380
why would you give these to a bunch of
non-military glorified garbage collectors?

33:28.860 --> 33:31.180
Well, we complain when people
aren't properly suited,

33:31.300 --> 33:33.340
now we're suspicious
when they are?

33:38.540 --> 33:40.620
You know what? Strike that.
I'm wrong.

33:40.620 --> 33:41.540
You're right.

33:51.780 --> 33:53.340
Connor? It's Caroline.

33:53.500 --> 33:54.700
Hey, Morrison, how're you doing?

33:54.900 --> 33:57.860
I'm good. I have some great news:
suits are safe.

33:58.060 --> 33:59.140
Didn't I tell you?

33:59.740 --> 34:03.420
You did, you're right. But I think
you forgot to pack the air tank.

34:04.020 --> 34:05.340
Classified.

34:05.340 --> 34:06.740
- Must be special.
- Very special.

34:08.540 --> 34:10.739
When's that Caribbean
cruise again?

34:11.980 --> 34:13.659
Are you offering me
a sexual favour?

34:13.940 --> 34:16.020
I'm threatening to
sink your boat.

34:17.300 --> 34:19.219
Morrison, you can say
or do whatever you want,

34:19.420 --> 34:20.820
it's not gonna wreck our friendship.

34:21.020 --> 34:23.179
But I can't let my baby
leave this building.

34:23.500 --> 34:25.460
You know, I was wondering
why you gave up.

34:25.980 --> 34:28.179
Now I'm wondering if you knew
the suits were safe,

34:28.260 --> 34:29.620
it was the tank that was a problem.

34:29.780 --> 34:31.139
Tell you what,
check your e-mail.

34:31.340 --> 34:33.620
I'll send you a consolation prize
that might interest you.

34:33.739 --> 34:34.500
Thanks, Connor.

34:40.139 --> 34:41.739
So, how's it going?

34:42.219 --> 34:43.940
I got nothing.

34:45.460 --> 34:48.139
I've looked at every known virus
that causes internal bleeding

34:48.300 --> 34:49.699
and there are no matches.

34:51.540 --> 34:54.699
Okay, how about this:
Willebrand Disorder.

34:55.340 --> 34:57.340
That's a bit of a stretch,
don't you think?

34:57.660 --> 35:00.260
A mutation.
It's been known to fool virologists.

35:00.420 --> 35:02.100
Yeah, but not physicians.

35:02.260 --> 35:04.980
Right? I mean, do you really
think that this could...

35:05.300 --> 35:06.300
No, no, no.

35:07.340 --> 35:10.620
No, I... I'm starting to have a hard time
thinking this even is haemophilia.

35:10.740 --> 35:13.260
- It's not the genetic kind.
- Well, it's not a virus.

35:13.500 --> 35:15.420
- So where does that leave us?
- I dunno.

35:19.700 --> 35:21.300
What is going on in there?

35:21.420 --> 35:22.020
Drama?

35:22.660 --> 35:23.980
- It's bullshit.
- Is it?

35:24.220 --> 35:25.500
First of all, who sent it?

35:25.660 --> 35:28.500
The point is, Louisa has
a habit of suing her employer.

35:28.540 --> 35:29.860
Please. Once? Once is not a habit.

35:29.860 --> 35:32.300
- Besides, she won.
- They settled out of court, Mayko!

35:32.300 --> 35:34.340
- They paid her!
- We don't know the details!

35:34.500 --> 35:37.260
She sued her employer over
working conditions. Sound familiar?

35:37.580 --> 35:41.020
Uh, yeah, maybe NorBAC should stop
expecting people to work 18 hours a day.

35:42.220 --> 35:43.940
I'll pass that on to David.

35:44.340 --> 35:45.620
Thanks for you input.

35:48.580 --> 35:49.340
Fuck!

35:49.900 --> 35:53.020
You think I'm full of shit
because I stuck up for my rights?

35:53.100 --> 35:55.140
Have you ever done piss
factory work, huh?

35:55.180 --> 35:56.620
- Take it easy, Louisa.
- Fuck no!

35:56.740 --> 35:58.060
It's an odd coincidence,
don't you think?

35:58.220 --> 36:00.620
No! You know what's an odd coincidence?
Every time I talk to you,

36:00.620 --> 36:02.820
- you check out my tits.
- Don't change the subject.

36:02.900 --> 36:04.820
I was letting the other girls
know their rights,

36:04.980 --> 36:06.420
so then they put me on the night shift.

36:06.460 --> 36:09.100
Then they changed my job so
I got 2$ an hour less.

36:09.340 --> 36:12.180
That's a constructive wrongful termination
action and I sued the bastards!

36:12.180 --> 36:13.820
- Excuse me!
- Wait.

36:13.980 --> 36:16.580
Wait, we had to ask you.

36:17.300 --> 36:18.460
I thought you trusted me.

36:18.660 --> 36:19.940
I do.

36:20.340 --> 36:22.300
Come on, let's keep talking,
I wanna help.

36:29.060 --> 36:29.660
Okay.

36:32.700 --> 36:33.940
So what else?

36:34.060 --> 36:35.260
The air tanks.

36:35.500 --> 36:38.340
Did you notice anything unusual about them?
Were there any markings, anything?

36:38.380 --> 36:41.020
Not that I noticed. They were white,
they connected to the suit.

36:41.660 --> 36:43.500
Well, did the air taste any different?

36:43.660 --> 36:44.860
- I mean, could there have been an additive?
- No.

36:45.700 --> 36:47.500
Was there something extra on the tanks?
Were they heavy?

36:47.620 --> 36:49.140
- Light.
- How light?

36:49.460 --> 36:51.340
- Three, 4 pounds.
- And when they were empty?

36:51.540 --> 36:52.140
Same.

36:53.700 --> 36:57.660
No, they'd have to be lighter.
I mean, compressed air adds a few pounds.

36:58.020 --> 37:00.900
No, they were the same.
Trust me, I could tell the difference.

37:04.300 --> 37:05.460
What's wrong?

37:05.500 --> 37:09.340
The tanks weren't just releasing oxygen,
they were collecting something else.

37:10.780 --> 37:12.100
What?

37:17.300 --> 37:20.660
Okay, the air tanks weighed
just as much empty as they do full, right?

37:20.980 --> 37:23.660
That shouldn't be possible, because as
they use up the compressed air in the tanks

37:23.700 --> 37:27.140
they should be getting lighter. However,
they're doing hard physical work,

37:27.420 --> 37:30.060
they'd be giving off enough moisture
through their breath and their sweat

37:30.380 --> 37:32.820
to make up the difference in
the weight, get it?

37:34.580 --> 37:39.020
The air tanks are collecting the workers'
moisture. It's about the water.

37:39.180 --> 37:41.020
It's not about the suit,
it's not about the site,

37:41.220 --> 37:44.380
it's about the Pentagon thinking
they're going to be fighting the Arabs

37:44.460 --> 37:45.620
for the next 50 years,

37:45.700 --> 37:48.220
they don't wanna be lugging their own
ater halfway around the globe.

37:48.220 --> 37:49.380
So it's water.

37:49.820 --> 37:51.620
I want you to tap all your contacts,

37:51.940 --> 37:54.460
any group who might have their eye
on the Pentagon right now,

37:54.460 --> 37:56.260
including your wacko sites.

37:56.620 --> 37:58.700
Find out anything you can about
water recycling programmes.

37:58.940 --> 37:59.500
Okay.

38:02.540 --> 38:03.780
Okay, what'cha got?

38:04.100 --> 38:06.740
Uh, we're calling the syndrome
in Mexico "SACS".

38:07.020 --> 38:08.980
Severe anticoagulation syndrome.

38:09.300 --> 38:10.540
What causes it?

38:10.780 --> 38:11.660
We don't know.

38:12.100 --> 38:14.740
The problem is the syndrome seems
to be related to environmental factors,

38:14.820 --> 38:15.940
but which ones...

38:16.860 --> 38:19.620
- Food is our first guess.
- Like an allergy?

38:19.780 --> 38:23.180
No, it's... it's more like a poison,
something that inhibits blood clotting.

38:23.380 --> 38:25.740
Snake or spider bites
can't be ruled out either.

38:25.900 --> 38:28.860
Or something in the air,
water, pollution.

38:29.420 --> 38:32.820
We have ruled out viruses.
Something bacterial is still on the table.

38:33.140 --> 38:34.940
So anything's possible.

38:35.340 --> 38:36.020
Yes.

38:36.380 --> 38:38.180
We just know what it is, but...

38:38.700 --> 38:41.220
I think we're going to need to
do some on-site tests.

38:41.500 --> 38:43.220
All right, why don't you
two pack a bag?

38:43.380 --> 38:45.620
Yes, you can.

38:49.460 --> 38:50.700
All right.

38:51.500 --> 38:52.500
Ready?

38:52.660 --> 38:53.620
Just about.

38:54.740 --> 38:57.900
I contacted all the groups that
monitor the U.S. military: nothing.

38:58.100 --> 38:59.620
So, I called the Pentagon.

38:59.780 --> 39:02.500
Well, I got no particulars, but
I do know what was being developed.

39:02.860 --> 39:06.020
WATR: water any time recycle,

39:06.220 --> 39:07.980
which was a mechanism
to harvest water

39:08.180 --> 39:10.740
from breath and sweat from
soldiers in the field.

39:10.940 --> 39:14.060
Well, I think we can now surmise
that the air tanks were collecting water.

39:14.300 --> 39:15.620
We drank our own sweat?

39:15.820 --> 39:18.340
Ha! Presumably, they cleaned it first.
Did you see any filtration?

39:18.460 --> 39:19.340
No.

39:19.540 --> 39:20.660
Where'd you get your water?

39:20.820 --> 39:22.620
From a big machine
on the back of a truck.

39:22.860 --> 39:24.380
It was called something funny,
it was like...

39:24.540 --> 39:26.300
- a Reimer.
- What's a Reimer?

39:26.460 --> 39:26.980
No idea.

39:27.140 --> 39:30.580
It might have to do with WAPR:
water any place recover.

39:30.780 --> 39:31.420
What?

39:31.620 --> 39:34.900
To recover potable water from mud,
puddles, polluted rivers, even latrines.

39:34.900 --> 39:35.980
Is that what does
motherfuckers gave us?

39:36.180 --> 39:37.860
That's what astronauts drink.
They don't get sick.

39:37.940 --> 39:39.620
Unless the Reimer wasn't working properly.

39:39.740 --> 39:43.140
We need to get our hands
on one of these things.

39:43.500 --> 39:44.100
Right.

39:46.660 --> 39:47.700
Thank you.

39:48.100 --> 39:50.980
Well, racking up the frequent
flyer points, are we?

39:51.140 --> 39:54.500
I thought maybe face-to-face,
I could convince you to change your mind.

39:54.900 --> 39:56.100
About the tank?

39:56.500 --> 39:57.620
No way.

39:57.900 --> 40:00.380
Okay. How about a Reimer?

40:02.500 --> 40:07.220
With that package, Caroline, you could
convince me to do just about anything.

40:07.420 --> 40:09.300
Except betray my country.

40:10.140 --> 40:14.300
I travel all this way
and all I get is some cornball line?

40:16.380 --> 40:18.980
How's it different from what
they use for astronauts?

40:19.220 --> 40:21.980
Smaller, faster, cheaper, better.

40:22.260 --> 40:23.740
That's all I'm saying.

40:26.660 --> 40:28.780
Save money on supply lines

40:28.780 --> 40:31.700
and free up soldiers for combat.

40:33.140 --> 40:35.100
Can't I have a peek?

40:35.340 --> 40:37.980
Maybe I can ease your disappointment
by buying you dinner.

40:38.140 --> 40:38.780
Sure.

40:38.900 --> 40:42.020
If the topic of conversation is
how Battle Support and Shining Armor

40:42.180 --> 40:44.140
are both owned by the same corporation.

40:45.940 --> 40:48.060
On 2nd thought,
I think I'll head straight home,

40:48.300 --> 40:49.940
see what the wife has cooking.

40:50.700 --> 40:54.380
You know what, Connor? We went looking
for notices of tender for the suit

40:54.540 --> 40:56.980
and funny thing is, we didn't find any.

41:05.940 --> 41:09.340
Shining Armor invented the suit.
They came to us with it.

41:09.620 --> 41:13.140
Our military couldn't ask for bids
on something they were given.

41:13.300 --> 41:16.700
And the cleanup?
Fifteen thousand men and women?

41:16.820 --> 41:18.900
Our deployment in Iraq was
part of a secret plan.

41:18.980 --> 41:22.420
We put out bids for support services,
it's not much of a secret, now, is it?

41:22.660 --> 41:26.220
Shining Armor and Battle Support
are both owned by Garfield Industries.

41:27.260 --> 41:28.260
Never did research...

41:28.300 --> 41:32.260
250 billion of Pentagon money
went to private contractors last year.

41:32.340 --> 41:35.260
Now, they're exempt
from the Freedom of Information Act

41:35.660 --> 41:37.300
and congressional oversight.

41:37.700 --> 41:41.260
- They don't have to worry about salary caps.
- The same with every other corporation.

41:41.380 --> 41:43.980
Wanna know how much public
money went to Garfield?

41:44.020 --> 41:46.260
Buy their stock.
Sounds like a good bet.

41:46.420 --> 41:49.540
Wasn't the previous CEO of Garfield
a certain advisor to the president?

41:49.940 --> 41:51.180
A piece of advice for you, Caroline:

41:51.380 --> 41:55.340
you should really save the ball-busting
routine till after your looks have faded.

41:56.340 --> 41:57.740
You know what, Connor?

41:57.980 --> 42:02.540
This might be just the time where you're
gonna have to forget about your career

42:02.860 --> 42:05.060
and your ego and your sex life

42:05.580 --> 42:07.540
and just do the right thing.

42:08.220 --> 42:09.620
I have a dozen sick people

42:09.820 --> 42:13.500
and a team of scientists who say
that the most probable cause is a Reimer.

42:18.140 --> 42:19.580
Let me think on it.

42:21.060 --> 42:22.780
I'll call you in the morning.

42:32.660 --> 42:34.540
So after the 1st Gulf War,

42:34.700 --> 42:38.300
the Americans encouraged the southern Shiites
to rebel against Saddam, right?

42:38.460 --> 42:40.780
But the U.S. reneged on its
promise to help.

42:40.980 --> 42:42.220
Saddam dammed the rivers

42:42.380 --> 42:45.580
and dried out all the marshes that sustained
hundreds of thousands of Shiites

42:45.700 --> 42:47.580
and drove them out,
slaughtered them,

42:47.820 --> 42:50.780
and now that entire area is just
a salt-encrusted wasteland.

42:51.060 --> 42:53.340
Yeah, I saw. It was unbelievable.

42:54.260 --> 42:55.740
But what does this have to
do with our work?

42:55.860 --> 42:59.100
They were testing Reimer's ability to
clean contaminated water.

43:00.300 --> 43:03.100
Not to mention Hamar is near
the worst water in the world.

43:03.100 --> 43:04.540
Perfect place to study it.

43:05.100 --> 43:06.860
I think you finally believe me.

43:07.060 --> 43:08.380
I always believed you.

43:09.700 --> 43:12.460
You're a smart scientist
and a terrible liar.

43:12.660 --> 43:14.260
Guilty as charged.

43:16.500 --> 43:19.340
Okay... I'm beat,
gotta go home.

43:19.380 --> 43:20.140
Yeah, okay.

43:21.180 --> 43:24.060
Uh, look, if you... if you want me
to drive you to Mayko's later,

43:24.220 --> 43:26.500
- you don't have to leave now.
- No! Well, I just...

43:26.620 --> 43:29.980
Hey, hey, hey, I'm just tired,
don't let me spoil the party.

43:30.580 --> 43:32.420
Never know when you'll be
back in Toronto.

43:32.620 --> 43:34.100
Thank you for everything.

43:34.420 --> 43:37.340
- Oh, yeah. Take care.
- You too.

43:37.780 --> 43:39.020
Have fun, you guys.

43:39.380 --> 43:40.020
Yeah?

43:40.700 --> 43:42.940
Hey, David, I was helping Jill
with her experiments,

43:43.220 --> 43:44.940
- looking through her lab notes.
- Yeah?

43:45.260 --> 43:48.260
I'm no virologist, but I am a biochemist

43:48.500 --> 43:50.220
with a lot of biophysics background.

43:50.540 --> 43:51.940
Pff, get to the point, Bob.

43:52.580 --> 43:54.340
I think I see where Jill went wrong.

43:54.660 --> 43:56.100
Are you sure?

43:56.500 --> 43:57.420
No.

43:58.020 --> 43:59.100
Almost.

43:59.380 --> 44:00.540
Actually, yes.

44:01.140 --> 44:04.220
Well, listen, if she calls, don't tell her
anything. I'll look at it tomorrow.

44:06.500 --> 44:08.700
But this is my last day.

44:10.300 --> 44:11.580
Hello?

44:56.340 --> 44:58.740
You might as well warn Louisa
that things are looking bad.

44:58.820 --> 45:00.300
Me? You're the one who brought her here.

45:00.420 --> 45:01.420
You're the one who's fucking her.

45:01.860 --> 45:03.220
We got a Reimer.

45:03.900 --> 45:05.580
It's amazing.
No bigger than a bar fridge,

45:05.580 --> 45:08.500
turns salt water, human waste,
anything, into pure drinking water.

45:08.980 --> 45:11.260
What we've done is we've
genetically modified this mustard

45:11.420 --> 45:13.420
so that if it comes in
contact with a buried landmine,

45:13.660 --> 45:14.980
it turns red, not green.

45:15.180 --> 45:16.660
- So, can we get samples?
- Yeah, sure.

45:16.740 --> 45:19.220
Hey, you don't think they're causing
the anticoagulation syndrome, do you?

45:19.460 --> 45:21.340
- Bob's not here.
- His stuff's gone.

45:21.660 --> 45:24.500
Let me get this straight:
I'm dealing with cutting-edge technology,

45:24.580 --> 45:26.780
but you'd rather be out there making
women smell better with beaver balls.

45:26.820 --> 45:27.780
You never listen.

45:27.940 --> 45:30.020
Jesus Christ, Bob,
what are you, my fucking wife?

45:35.540 --> 45:37.300
You're leaving, you're running off
to Mexico?

45:37.460 --> 45:38.820
There's been an outbreak, okay?
People are dying.

45:38.980 --> 45:39.940
Goddammit!

45:40.100 --> 45:42.020
People are dying right here, David!
