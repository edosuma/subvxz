Spike.

00:25.700 --> 00:28.500
[Panting]
Spike, wait.

00:28.500 --> 00:31.300
That's not a prize
you're holding.

00:31.300 --> 00:34.200
It's not a trophy.
It's a burden.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.100
- It's a cr...
- Blah, blah, blah.

00:36.100 --> 00:39.000
Give it a rest, hero.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.800
I win, you lose, and all your talking's
not gonna change that.

00:42.800 --> 00:46.100
L-It's not your destiny.
It's mine.

00:47.200 --> 00:49.400
Still can't accept it?

00:49.400 --> 00:51.300
It's pathetic, really.

00:51.300 --> 00:54.800
All your life's been a lie,
everything you've done...

00:54.800 --> 00:57.700
<i>the lives you've saved,</i>
<i>dreams of redemption...</i>

00:57.700 --> 00:59.600
all that pain...

00:59.600 --> 01:01.200
all of it for nothing.

01:01.200 --> 01:03.100
'Cause this...

01:04.300 --> 01:06.700
was never about you.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.600
Cheers.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.900

<i>So be a good lad and push off.</i>

<i>Guy like you, whiling away his time</i>

02:13.600 --> 02:16.200

who's feeling kinda lost.

02:16.200 --> 02:18.200
Is that right?

02:18.200 --> 02:20.800
Funny. I thought I knew
exactly where I was.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.700
A place called
the Peppermint Stick.

02:22.700 --> 02:24.700
Prima ballerina up there is Sunshine...

02:24.700 --> 02:27.000
though I'm fairly certain
that's not her real name.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.300
You know, we really should talk.

02:30.500 --> 02:33.100
You know, really not.

02:33.100 --> 02:35.000
I don't know what you're selling...

02:35.000 --> 02:37.900
but best you peddle your wares
someplace else...

02:37.900 --> 02:40.100

02:42.300 --> 02:44.200
Hey, Spike.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.400
Get any interesting mail lately?

02:50.600 --> 02:52.500
Who the bloody hell are you?

02:56.100 --> 02:58.200
Your new best friend.

03:48.100 --> 03:51.300
<i>- [R&B: Ballad]</i>
- You?

03:51.300 --> 03:55.200
You say you're responsible
for me being back.

03:55.200 --> 03:58.100
Sent that package
with the de-ghosting mojo.

03:58.100 --> 04:00.100
And?

04:00.100 --> 04:02.000
The amulet.

04:03.700 --> 04:06.400
You mailed that thing
to Wolfram and Hart?

04:06.400 --> 04:08.900
Couldn't leave your spirit
trapped in a bottle...

04:08.900 --> 04:10.800
at the bottom
of a Hellmouth, could we?

04:10.800 --> 04:13.300
- And who's we?
<i>- Come on, Spike.</i>

04:13.300 --> 04:16.500
You must know there's a lot of folks
out there that are interested in you.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.899
Powerfully interested, one might...

04:20.899 --> 04:23.300
Enough with the cryptic, Butch.

04:23.300 --> 04:28.700
I wanna know who... or <i>what</i> you are,
what you want...

04:28.700 --> 04:32.200
and how fast I can snap your forearm
before you answer.

04:33.300 --> 04:35.800
You can call me Doyle.

04:35.800 --> 04:38.900
It's not what I want.
It's what <i>you</i> want.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.700
You got your life back now.

04:46.700 --> 04:50.300
What are you gonna do about it?

04:50.300 --> 04:52.900
<i>[Wesley]</i>
<i>I say we make a preemptive strike.</i>

04:52.900 --> 04:55.400
Remove him before he and his followers
go underground.

04:55.400 --> 04:58.300
- Assassination?
- We're talking about an evil warlock here.

04:58.300 --> 05:01.200
- The longer we wait,
the more powerful he becomes.
- I don't plan on waiting.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.500
- Really? What is your plan?
- We open a can of Machiavelli on his ass.

05:03.500 --> 05:07.200
It's Matchabelli, Einstein,
and it doesn't come in a can.

05:07.200 --> 05:09.000
- Is he in?
- Is who in?

05:11.500 --> 05:14.000
<i>- [Door Opens]</i>
<i>- What you're proposing could take weeks.</i>

05:14.000 --> 05:15.900
- We can't afford the delay.
- 48 hours, maximum.

05:15.900 --> 05:18.100
There are at least two initiates
to his inner circle...

05:18.100 --> 05:20.400
who would jump at the chance
to overthrow him.

05:20.400 --> 05:22.500
You're overlooking the tactical merits
of my assassination scenario.

05:22.500 --> 05:25.400
- Guys...
- In my plan, he still wakes up dead by Thursday.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.300
Guys!

05:28.700 --> 05:31.600
C.E.O. Right here, in the dark.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.600
Sorry, Angel.

05:33.600 --> 05:37.200
- Lucien Drake. He's a warlock.
- An evil warlock and a cult leader.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.200
Got over a thousand followers.

05:39.200 --> 05:42.800
They sold most of their children
down the Hades River in return
for some serious demonic mojo.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.900
<i>[Wesley] One more religious fringe group</i>
<i>stockpiling weapons.</i>

05:44.900 --> 05:48.700
But, in this case
the weapons are black magics...

05:48.700 --> 05:50.600
<i>of the most dangerous variety.</i>

05:50.600 --> 05:53.600
And you want Wolfram and Hart
to stop them.

05:53.600 --> 05:56.200
- Not so much stopping as...
- As redirecting their energies.

05:56.200 --> 05:58.200
<i>A cult this big</i>
<i>has alliances, connections.</i>

05:58.200 --> 06:01.000
If we confront them directly,
it could be very bad for business.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.300
But if we eliminate
their leader covertly...

06:03.300 --> 06:05.700
<i>[Gunn]</i>
<i>Then they spend the next billing cycle...</i>

06:05.700 --> 06:08.600
<i>fighting among themselves</i>
<i>to hack out the new pecking order.</i>

06:08.600 --> 06:13.700
Uh-huh. So, are we doing this because it's right
or because it's cost-effective?

06:13.700 --> 06:16.600
Uh, well...
a little of both, actually.

06:16.600 --> 06:19.700
Yes. Oddly, once again,
we find ourselves in a bit of a gray...

06:19.700 --> 06:21.300
- Don't...
- area.

06:21.300 --> 06:23.200
Say that!

06:23.200 --> 06:26.300
[Sighs] Can we just get through
one damn day without saying that?

06:33.600 --> 06:37.300
Okay, explain it to me again.

06:37.300 --> 06:39.100
I've heard enough.

06:39.100 --> 06:42.000
Don't you even want to know
why you came back to L.A.?

06:42.000 --> 06:44.400
You hate this city.
There's gotta be a reason. Right?

06:44.400 --> 06:47.400
- You talk a lot for somebody saying nothing.
- You've got a destiny.

06:47.400 --> 06:52.300
Like the destiny that was supposed to be
at the bottom of a cup of perpetual nothing?

06:52.300 --> 06:54.500
What?

06:54.500 --> 06:56.400
You know so much about me...

06:56.400 --> 06:59.200
you must know
I get <i>really</i> violent...

06:59.200 --> 07:01.100
when I'm being played.

07:01.100 --> 07:05.100
It's you who sent Angel and me
on that wild goose chase.

07:05.100 --> 07:07.000
I don't know anything.

07:08.900 --> 07:10.900
I'm just doing what they tell me.

07:10.900 --> 07:13.300
- "They"?
- They! Them!

07:13.300 --> 07:15.800
Bringing you back!

07:15.800 --> 07:18.700
Look, I'm just a guy.
A nobody. A drifter.

07:18.700 --> 07:22.100
I was minding my own business,
and then one day... wham!

07:22.100 --> 07:24.000
I start having these visions.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.200
- Visions?
- Yeah.

07:27.200 --> 07:30.900
Like... brain pictures.
But they hurt.

07:30.900 --> 07:33.900
Like when you eat ice cream too fast.

07:33.900 --> 07:36.000
I started seeing people in trouble.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.600
We need a champion.

07:39.600 --> 07:43.100
Hey, you are barking up the wrong vampire.
That's Angel's beat.

07:43.100 --> 07:45.000
Angel's not in the picture anymore.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.400
He's working
the other side of the tracks.

07:47.400 --> 07:50.300
Nobody is out there helping
the people that really need help.

07:50.300 --> 07:55.000
So I'm supposed to jump every time
you get a vision of someone in dire peril?

07:55.000 --> 07:57.100
Why do you think
we're having this conversation?

07:58.200 --> 08:00.500
I had one right before I came here.

08:00.500 --> 08:02.800
<i>You don't have to believe me.</i>

08:02.800 --> 08:07.100
But if a young girl gets murdered tonight,
and you didn't lift a finger to stop it...

08:07.100 --> 08:10.800
ask yourself...
can you live with that?

08:13.100 --> 08:15.500
[Screaming]

08:15.500 --> 08:17.900
<i>- [Spike] Evenin'</i>
- Get lost.

08:19.300 --> 08:22.000
I already am,
according to some.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.800
- What?
- Help me!

08:23.800 --> 08:25.700
I don't think you heard me.

08:25.700 --> 08:27.600
<i>[Woman Whimpering]</i>

08:29.300 --> 08:31.300
[Gasping]

08:31.300 --> 08:34.200
- Get out of here.
- Can't do it.

08:34.200 --> 08:37.100
You just made
the biggest mistake of your life.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.299
[Groans]

08:41.500 --> 08:43.299
[Screaming]

08:49.800 --> 08:52.600
<i>Thank you. Thank you.!</i>
<i>That thing was gonna kill me.!</i>

08:52.600 --> 08:56.500
Well, what do you expect?
Out alone in this neighborhood?

08:56.500 --> 08:59.400
- I got half a mind to kill you myself, you half-wit.
- What?

08:59.400 --> 09:03.100
I mean, honestly, what kind of retard
wears heels like that in a dark alley?

09:03.100 --> 09:05.500
Take two steps,
break your bloody ankle.

09:05.500 --> 09:09.500
- I was just trying to get home.
- Well, get a cab, you moron.

09:09.700 --> 09:13.500
And on the way, if a stranger
offers you candy, don't get in the van.

09:14.700 --> 09:16.600
Stupid cow.

09:16.600 --> 09:18.900
<i>Believe me now?</i>

09:20.100 --> 09:22.600
What, your victim vision?
Please.

09:22.600 --> 09:26.600
<i>Can't throw a bloody stone in this town</i>
<i>without hitting some bimbo in trouble.</i>

09:26.800 --> 09:28.500
Tough guy, huh?

09:29.800 --> 09:32.700
Nice work, by the way,
taking out that vamp.

09:32.700 --> 09:35.700
Oh, yeah. Epic battle.
My finest hour.

09:35.700 --> 09:38.900
You just saved a girl's life.
That's nothing to laugh off.

09:38.900 --> 09:42.700
Though you could try being a little nicer
next time. You almost made her cry.

09:42.700 --> 09:44.400
- Next time?
- Well, that's up to you.

09:44.400 --> 09:46.600
A lot more people need saving.

09:46.600 --> 09:49.000
News flash, Sparky:
Don't need your help.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.100
- Been saving people long before you showed up.
- Not like this.

09:53.800 --> 09:56.700
You just helped a person
when there wasn't anything in it for you.

09:56.700 --> 09:59.500
- That's not like the Spike I know.
- Oh, is that right?

09:59.500 --> 10:02.900
- And what Spike is that?
- The Spike that's only out for himself.

10:02.900 --> 10:06.200
Who only does good deeds
to impress... women.

10:06.200 --> 10:10.600
- You'd best watch your...
- I'm just saying... you did good.

10:10.600 --> 10:14.200
From what I hear, Angel didn't
save the girl on his first mission.

10:14.200 --> 10:16.700
What's Angel got to do with this?

10:16.700 --> 10:19.400
Well, nothin'.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.400
Not anymore.

10:21.400 --> 10:25.100
<i>- I know how these people think.</i>
- And I know what we have in our arsenal, Charles.

10:25.100 --> 10:27.500
Guys, I can hear you
out in the lobby.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.500
The week's lab reports, Angel.

10:29.500 --> 10:32.000
Fred, doesn't the Wolfram and Hart satellite
have lethal capability?

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
What?

10:33.000 --> 10:36.200
Couldn't we eliminate a target
from the air untraceably?

10:36.200 --> 10:40.000
Well, we do have an orbital-range
microwave cannon up there.

10:40.300 --> 10:43.700
<i>Focuses the satellite's communication</i>
<i>signals into a pinpoint beam.</i>

10:43.700 --> 10:48.400
It can raise the temperature of the targeted
area 1,000 degrees in less than five seconds.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.900
So, yeah, in theory we could.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.400
That is, if we did that sort of thing.

10:53.400 --> 10:56.800
- Do we do that sort of thing?
<i>- [Wesley] It might be the thing to do.</i>

10:56.800 --> 11:00.100
<i>[Gunn] Think someone won't notice us</i>
<i>firing a sci-fi death ray from outer space?</i>

11:00.100 --> 11:04.900
<i>[Fred] Actually, the beam reads like cell phone</i>
<i>static on most atmospheric scanners, but...</i>

11:04.900 --> 11:08.200
- Let's kill them all.
- What?

11:08.200 --> 11:11.100
Warlocks, minions...
they're all evil.

11:11.100 --> 11:14.300
Sold their kids to the devil.
Let's just wipe 'em all out.

11:14.300 --> 11:16.500
<i>- We got the power to do that, right?</i>
- Yes, but...

11:16.500 --> 11:19.200
Well, why don't we?
Let's get back to the basics.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.800
Good versus evil.
Offing the monsters where we find them.

11:21.800 --> 11:24.100
We have to tread light here.
We can't afford to...

11:25.200 --> 11:26.900
Are you all right?

11:28.000 --> 11:29.900
[Sighs]

11:29.900 --> 11:32.200
I'm just tired.

11:32.200 --> 11:35.000
Gunn, get a meeting
with your bestJudas.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.900
<i>Feel him out.</i>

11:36.900 --> 11:38.800
<i>But don't tip your hand.</i>

11:38.800 --> 11:42.600
Any hint of him carrying word
back to Drake, we go with Wes's plan.

11:44.800 --> 11:47.600
- Are you sure you're all right?
- You don't look so good.

11:47.600 --> 11:50.100
Yeah, l-I just...

11:50.100 --> 11:52.000
need to get some rest.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.800
Go. Rest.
And maybe sleep in tomorrow.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.200
Ah, there's too much
on our schedule.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.100
It's nothing we can't handle.

12:01.100 --> 12:04.000
Yeah, anything earth-shattering comes up,
we know where to find you.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.200

12:31.000 --> 12:32.800
Hey, Wes.

12:32.800 --> 12:35.200
- You're barely on your feet. Here.
- [Groans]

12:35.200 --> 12:37.600
Yeah... I think...

12:37.600 --> 12:39.500
l-I think I'm sick.

12:39.500 --> 12:41.400
Vampires don't get sick.

12:41.400 --> 12:43.800
[Continues Groaning]

12:43.800 --> 12:47.300
- I don't feel right.
<i>- Well, that's understandable.</i>

12:47.300 --> 12:49.700
You've got a lot on your mind.

12:49.700 --> 12:52.100
Must be hard adjusting
to the new situation.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.100
Situation?

12:56.100 --> 12:58.800
Finally coming to grips
with the truth...

12:58.800 --> 13:00.800
that you are irrelevant.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.100
What?

13:05.100 --> 13:07.000
[Sighs]

13:07.000 --> 13:09.100
It's difficult to face, I know...

13:09.100 --> 13:12.300
but things
could have been much worse.

13:12.300 --> 13:14.800
Spike's arrival
was actually quite fortuitous.

13:17.700 --> 13:20.800
It'll make this a lot easier.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.900
Wh-What?
What are you...

13:25.900 --> 13:28.800
[Panting]

13:32.000 --> 13:33.400
<i>[Blow Lands]</i>

14:02.000 --> 14:04.200

Oh.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.600
It's all right.
You're safe now.

14:09.200 --> 14:11.100
What were those things?

14:11.100 --> 14:13.500
You're better off not knowing.
Believe me.

14:13.500 --> 14:16.500
Wait. Who are you?

14:16.500 --> 14:18.000
I'm the hero.

14:22.800 --> 14:25.700
Harmony, I need you
to run these to Accounting.

14:25.700 --> 14:27.600
Tell them it's about
the warlock situation.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.100
I'm not allowed to talk to Accounting
without Angel's approval.

14:31.800 --> 14:35.300
I accidentally authorized
a few Bath of the Month subscriptions.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.700
On accident.

14:38.700 --> 14:41.600
Give them my authorization code.
Have them cut a check.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.800
- Send it immediately.
<i>- [Eve] That's the spirit.</i>

14:43.800 --> 14:46.100
Solving problems
by throwing money at them.

14:46.100 --> 14:49.000
You're starting to get
the hang of this job.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.200
Something I can
help you with, Eve?

14:51.200 --> 14:54.000
- Looking for the big man.
- He's indisposed right now. What can I do for you?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.800
Yeah, sorry, but I gotta go
straight to Angel on this one.

14:56.800 --> 14:59.700
Whatever you've got there, Angel's
just gonna hand it off to me anyway.

14:59.700 --> 15:02.400
So you may as well
show it to me now.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.600
Fair enough.

15:05.600 --> 15:09.300
Senior partners
are very interested in this.

15:09.300 --> 15:13.700
I don't know what it is, to be honest.
I get the sense that they don't either.

15:13.700 --> 15:17.300
They must suspect it's powerful. They're
chomping at the bit to learn whatever they can.

15:17.300 --> 15:19.200
We'll do our best.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.100
Probably goes without saying, but...

15:21.100 --> 15:23.900
I'll have it for you
as soon as possible.

15:23.900 --> 15:26.300
That's my boy.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.200
Any business with the senior partners...

15:28.200 --> 15:30.100
I'm supposed to
tell Angel immediately.

15:30.100 --> 15:32.800
I'll take care of it, Harmony.

15:32.800 --> 15:37.400
Also, anytime anything comes in with runes
on it, I'm supposed to tell Angel immediately.

15:37.400 --> 15:40.300
And not try and read the runes myself.

15:40.300 --> 15:42.500
'Cause that can cause a fire.

15:42.500 --> 15:45.400
As soon as we have some answers,
we'll fill him in.

15:45.400 --> 15:48.800
Until then, I think Angel
deserves some peace and quiet.

16:14.500 --> 16:17.200
- I think something's wrong.
<i>- Okay.</i>

16:18.700 --> 16:21.400
Okay, don't worry.

16:21.400 --> 16:23.300
I know what to do.

16:28.100 --> 16:31.000

Fred?

16:40.100 --> 16:42.000
What are you doing?

16:50.500 --> 16:52.400
It's okay.

16:54.300 --> 16:56.800
Huh?
[Gasping, Panting]

16:56.800 --> 16:58.700

17:07.200 --> 17:09.099

There.

17:09.099 --> 17:11.300

17:11.300 --> 17:14.500
<i>Okay, let's get these</i>

You're a vampire.

17:25.900 --> 17:28.300
You don't need this stuff anyway.

17:28.300 --> 17:30.700
Probably should have had it
removed a long time ago.

17:30.700 --> 17:33.400
- Oh!

17:35.900 --> 17:37.900
Ah! There's your heart!

17:38.700 --> 17:40.400
Hey! What do you know?

17:40.400 --> 17:42.300
It <i>is</i> a dried-up little walnut.

17:42.300 --> 17:44.700

Oh. Hang on.

Thank you, bear.

Huh.

18:29.600 --> 18:32.100
What's wrong?

18:32.100 --> 18:34.700
Nothing.

18:34.700 --> 18:38.300
I can't seem to find
anything wrong with you.

18:38.300 --> 18:40.200
I mean...

18:40.200 --> 18:42.300
except that you're empty.

18:43.400 --> 18:46.700
There's nothing left.
Just a shell.

18:51.200 --> 18:53.600
I think I can hear
the ocean in there.

19:20.300 --> 19:24.300
Getting reports of a vigilante prowling
the streets last night. A vampire, apparently.

19:24.300 --> 19:26.900
Angel never left his penthouse.

19:28.800 --> 19:32.300
Vigilante reportedly killed two vampires
at a gas station...

19:32.300 --> 19:35.200
<i>and then asked the women</i>
<i>he'd saved if they'd, quote...</i>

19:35.200 --> 19:39.800
"like to get a bottle of hooch and listen
to some Sex Pistols records with him."

19:39.800 --> 19:45.300
<i>Are we sure Angel's just tired</i>
<i>and not, um, crazy?</i>

19:45.300 --> 19:47.200
Read the description.

platinum blond hair.

20:02.200 --> 20:04.100
You gonna invite me in?

20:04.100 --> 20:07.100
It's not my place.
It's yours.

20:08.200 --> 20:09.900
Building's quiet.

20:09.900 --> 20:11.800
<i>Windows don't get direct sunlight.</i>

20:11.800 --> 20:14.900
<i>You've got sewer entrance</i>
<i>for your daytime travel.</i>

20:14.900 --> 20:16.800
What, no cable?

20:16.800 --> 20:19.400
You got water, electricity,
heating... all the basics.

20:19.400 --> 20:22.300
You even got a Korean market
on the corner... open all night.

20:22.300 --> 20:25.700
Look, appreciate what you've done for me,
making me corporeal and all...

20:25.700 --> 20:28.500
but I draw the line
at being your kept boy.

20:28.500 --> 20:31.900
Oh. You got
someplace else to live?

20:31.900 --> 20:35.100

money tucked away somewhere.

20:35.100 --> 20:37.000
<i>You'll find something soon.</i>

20:38.100 --> 20:40.400

20:40.400 --> 20:42.900
Or your coat.

20:42.900 --> 20:45.300
- [Sighs]
- Could say thank you.

20:45.300 --> 20:48.200
Great.
Another ruddy basement.

20:48.200 --> 20:50.100
What do you want?
Creature comforts?

20:50.100 --> 20:52.000
<i>You could go to Wolfram and Hart.</i>

20:52.000 --> 20:55.700
This place has everything you need
to be a hero.

20:55.700 --> 20:59.500
Job requires somewhat
of a spartan existence.

20:59.500 --> 21:01.700
You call that a bed?

on it this afternoon.

Need me to help you collate something?

26:45.700 --> 26:47.600
We figure that's our territory.

Is that what this is about? You're hurt
'cause I stepped on your toesies?

26:51.900 --> 26:55.700
Not at all. We're wondering
why you left in the first place.

26:57.600 --> 27:00.100

to help you do it.

No offense, Mr. Vader,
but I've got no itch to join the evil empire.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.900
I told Angel, and I'll tell you.

Things aren't
that cut and dried, Spike.

We're just playing by a new set of rules.

come play with you?

27:44.700 --> 27:49.000
- Something like that.

Are you sure Team Angel
hasn't been checking up on him?

28:25.900 --> 28:30.200
Told you. They're busy working on some relic
that's got the senior partners in a huff.

28:32.300 --> 28:34.800
So, we gonna do this, or what?

Hey.

Fine. Let's talk more.

- So far.

28:47.200 --> 28:50.700
I mean, he hasn't sewn a big red "S"
on his chest yet, but he's getting there.

28:52.300 --> 28:55.200
We keep building him up
while we tear Angel down.

28:55.200 --> 28:58.600
Pretty soon the senior partners are gonna
start thinking they're backing the wrong horse.

off Wolfram and Hart's radar.

I can't think they're sexy.

29:37.700 --> 29:40.100

what I want?

29:40.100 --> 29:42.900

keep up the teasing all day?

Oh, you know. Stuff.

- Apparently, we're not good enough for him.
- Thinks we sold out.

We didn't sell out.
We're changing the system from the inside.

You know, when you say it out loud
it sounds really naive.

30:30.400 --> 30:32.500
Well, shouldn't we
tell Angel about this?

30:32.500 --> 30:36.300
Tell him what? That Spike's hung out a shingle
and is open for business in Angel's town?

30:36.300 --> 30:38.700
I don't think he needs
to hear it right now.

30:38.700 --> 30:41.100
It's not like
we need to protect him.

30:41.100 --> 30:43.900

heard from him today?

Hey, Harmony.
Um, any word from Angel?

30:51.400 --> 30:54.100
Oh.
Haven't heard a peep.
