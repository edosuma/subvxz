But you're not gonna believe
what happens after that.

03:40.321 --> 03:41.670
LUKE: Come on, Max.

03:41.671 --> 03:43.022
No, I swear to God,
it's totally true.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.923
Can I get you folks
something with your coffee?

03:44.925 --> 03:48.393
Our famous pecan pie is
on special at only $1.99.

03:55.536 --> 03:56.735
I think we're good, thanks.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.037
That pecan pie sure
does sound good though.

03:59.039 --> 04:00.939
[Lauren laughing]

04:00.941 --> 04:03.542
So anyway, this guy
thinks it's all over,

04:04.511 --> 04:06.845
but he never
developed the picture.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.247
When he finally does,

04:08.249 --> 04:09.682
the ghost is right in
there right next to her.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.416
It was in the house all along.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.051
That's bullshit.

04:13.052 --> 04:14.685
It's totally true,
my cousin's neighbor

04:14.688 --> 04:16.788
knew the actual guy it
happened to back in Jersey.

04:16.790 --> 04:17.790
Swear to God.

04:19.192 --> 04:20.358
I gotta go to the restroom.

04:21.028 --> 04:21.793
Do you need this?

04:21.795 --> 04:23.095
No, I don't.

04:27.768 --> 04:28.934
Do you have a restroom?

04:31.071 --> 04:32.638
Just down there to the left.

04:34.808 --> 04:37.109
You're scaring Holly with
those stupid ghost stories.

04:37.111 --> 04:38.310
They're not stories, man.

04:38.312 --> 04:39.412
This kind of stuff
happens all the time.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.712
You just don't hear about it.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.781
Ghosts, demons, possessions.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.017
Yeah, then how is it that you're

04:44.018 --> 04:45.317
the only one talking about it?

04:45.319 --> 04:46.551
Are you dumb?

04:46.553 --> 04:49.421
Government keep a lid on
it to keep people in line.

04:49.423 --> 04:50.689
Anyway, your little sister's

04:50.691 --> 04:52.557
got worse things to be
scared of than ghosts.

04:52.559 --> 04:54.661
If I'd have known how
monumentally fucked up she was...

04:54.662 --> 04:56.011
What?

04:56.012 --> 04:57.363
Jesus Christ, she
almost died last night.

04:57.364 --> 04:58.597
We're not equipped for that.

Look, she'll be fine
once we get to I.A.

05:01.335 --> 05:02.701
That's the plan, isn't it?

05:02.703 --> 05:04.303
Get her to California.

05:04.305 --> 05:05.637
Lauren's idea.

05:05.639 --> 05:08.373
My sister and her boyfriend
moved out there last year.

05:08.375 --> 05:10.309
They got all the
treatment you want,

05:10.311 --> 05:11.677
you don't even have to register

05:11.679 --> 05:13.645
or say your name or anything.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.881
They hand out that shit
like candy in Cali.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.418
We'd get there quicker if
we didn't keep stopping

05:18.419 --> 05:19.918
in all these stupid places.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.321
Hey, these places
is what's gonna pay

05:22.323 --> 05:23.422
for our summer, Luke.

05:24.224 --> 05:25.490
Look, a couple more of these

05:25.492 --> 05:27.926
and we'll be fixed
up till September.

05:27.928 --> 05:30.529
Come on, guys, it's gonna
be lit, Cali sunshine

balls off back East,

05:41.141 --> 05:43.342
Okay, so we're good to go?

out until we're done.

I'm done.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.514
Right, we're outta here.

06:22.516 --> 06:25.083
You people better not even
dream about calling the cops.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.585
We won't.

Shit, I told you
that was a gunshot.

07:05.058 --> 07:07.159
Look at that, it's gone
right through the radiator.

07:07.161 --> 07:08.860
Okay, look, can you fix it?

07:08.862 --> 07:09.861
Are you kidding?

07:09.863 --> 07:11.463
On the side of the road?

07:11.465 --> 07:13.132
It took my dad years to
find all the parts for this.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.099
It's a classic.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.600
So, what are you gonna do?

07:15.602 --> 07:16.836
'Cause I'm not
about to wait here

07:16.837 --> 07:18.403
and get my ass shot
off by them hicks

07:18.405 --> 07:19.739
coming from the diner
for their money.

07:19.740 --> 07:22.941
Look, if we had water, I
can refill the radiator.

07:23.777 --> 07:24.709
It's just gonna leak out again,

07:24.711 --> 07:25.644
but if we start with it cool,

07:25.646 --> 07:28.380
we can make it a few more miles.

07:28.382 --> 07:30.015
Then we do it
again, let it cool,

07:30.017 --> 07:31.483
fill it up, a few more miles.

07:31.485 --> 07:33.051
We could make the
next town at least.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.653
Yeah, great plan.

07:34.655 --> 07:35.855
Except we don't have any water

07:35.856 --> 07:37.856
and we're in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.125
Unless you want to
go back to the diner

07:39.126 --> 07:40.525
and ask them to
use their faucet.

07:40.527 --> 07:42.194
I saw a house back there.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.500
Out here, you sure?

07:50.704 --> 07:52.103
I didn't see no house.

07:52.105 --> 07:53.605
It was kind of weird-looking.

07:53.607 --> 07:55.474
I saw it through the trees.

07:55.476 --> 07:57.042
Is she seeing things again?

go searching the forest

I saw it too.

08:06.620 --> 08:07.853

08:08.589 --> 08:09.988
Not far, a couple of minutes.

harder than I thought.

is a working faucet.

Well, that'd be a miracle,

about to fucking fall down.

09:01.508 --> 09:03.708
Lauren, go knock on the door.

09:03.710 --> 09:04.710
Why me?

09:05.979 --> 09:07.380
Because if there's some
old grandma living there,

09:07.381 --> 09:08.648
she's sure as hell not
gonna open the door

09:08.649 --> 09:10.148
for someone like me.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.751
You really think there's
gonna be anyone in there?

things the smart way.

carry the water in.

Bottles, cans,
whatever you can find.

09:24.164 --> 09:27.165

if I see anything.

10:02.636 --> 10:03.802
Okay, let's do this.

10:06.473 --> 10:07.473
You okay?

10:23.890 --> 10:28.093
Not bad, not a bad
hideout, what do you say?

10:28.095 --> 10:30.295
I thought we were in a
hurry to get to I.A.?

10:30.297 --> 10:32.998
Well, plans can change.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.300
I don't know, I
kinda like the place.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.702
What about getting
your ass shot off?

10:36.703 --> 10:38.603
No, we can defend the
place, hole it up,

10:38.605 --> 10:40.305
fight 'em off like
in the movies!

kitchen and find some water.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.546
I'm staying with Holly.

10:50.217 --> 10:52.384
Yeah, I figured as much.

11:02.663 --> 11:04.329

11:17.344 --> 11:20.645
Tea pots, tea cups,
more tea cups.

11:20.647 --> 11:24.082
Damn, you think the people who
own this place are British?

11:29.756 --> 11:31.089
You okay?

11:31.091 --> 11:32.824
My arms hurt.

11:32.826 --> 11:33.692
Okay.

11:33.694 --> 11:34.959
And my legs hurt.

11:35.462 --> 11:36.294
Right.

11:36.296 --> 11:37.529
Everything fucking hurts.

11:37.531 --> 11:38.531
Okay.

11:39.533 --> 11:42.934
It used to feel good,
when I would inject.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.035
Really fucking good.

11:45.572 --> 11:47.706
Made me forget about everything,

11:47.708 --> 11:49.474
all the shit we
were going through.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.280
Now, I have to do it
just to feel normal.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.751
It'll be fine once
we get to I.A.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.120
That's a nice dream.

12:02.122 --> 12:06.324
It's not a dream, we'll make it.

12:09.362 --> 12:10.695
I don't trust Max.

12:11.665 --> 12:12.797
You shouldn't either.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.468
What about Lauren?

12:16.470 --> 12:17.702
She's okay.

12:19.473 --> 12:20.473
She likes you.

12:23.343 --> 12:24.343
What do you mean?

12:25.445 --> 12:28.079
What I say, a girl can tell.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.052
Do you like her?

12:36.256 --> 12:39.924
I don't know, I never
met her before this.

12:41.661 --> 12:43.094
Thought she was into Max.

12:43.096 --> 12:47.799
No, he has a tiny
dick, she told me.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.835
Must be why he's
mad all the time.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.106
Rock and roll!

12:58.645 --> 13:00.745
We make a pretty
good team, don't we?

13:00.747 --> 13:01.747
I guess.

13:04.017 --> 13:07.152
Hey, we could be like the next
Bonnie and Clyde, you know?

13:07.154 --> 13:08.419
Who's that?

13:08.421 --> 13:09.954
You never heard of
Bonnie and Clyde?

13:09.956 --> 13:11.222
You never seen the movie?

13:11.224 --> 13:12.490
Must've missed it.

13:12.492 --> 13:13.992
Hey, look I'm just saying,

13:13.994 --> 13:16.661
like, it would be pretty
cool, like the two of us,

13:16.663 --> 13:19.230
we could just take off,
do whatever we want.

13:19.232 --> 13:20.932
How many gas stations and diners

13:20.934 --> 13:23.101
do you think there are
between here and I.A.?

13:23.103 --> 13:24.403
It doesn't take
more than two of us

13:24.404 --> 13:26.137
to rip one of those places off.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.506
So, what are you saying?

13:28.508 --> 13:30.842
Look, I'm just saying,
sometimes it feels

13:30.844 --> 13:33.011
like we're carrying a
bit of extra weight.

13:33.814 --> 13:34.746
It's Luke's car.

13:34.748 --> 13:37.348
No, no, it's his dad's car.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.884
Whatever, can't make a
road trip without a car.

13:39.886 --> 13:42.520
Shit, look at this.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.223
We could buy two fucking
cars with this money

13:44.224 --> 13:46.791
if we didn't have to
split it four ways.

13:46.793 --> 13:48.326
Four ways?

13:48.328 --> 13:49.828
You're splitting it with Holly?

13:49.830 --> 13:51.863
Luke wouldn't bring
the car if I didn't.

13:51.865 --> 13:53.148
He wouldn't have come at all

13:53.149 --> 13:54.433
if you didn't spin
him that bullshit

13:54.434 --> 13:55.633
about the rehab center.

13:56.369 --> 13:58.570
No, it's not bullshit.

13:58.572 --> 14:00.539
They got my sister's boyfriend
off heroin out there,

14:00.540 --> 14:02.640
and he has been clean
for six months now.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.275
Oh, whatever.

14:04.277 --> 14:07.045
[tense music]

14:07.047 --> 14:08.746
I really need some, Luke.

14:08.748 --> 14:09.748
Sure, okay.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.854
There's not much left
after last night.

14:15.856 --> 14:19.357
That's okay, I'm trying
to cut down anyway.

14:20.160 --> 14:20.992
[Holly groans]

14:20.994 --> 14:22.460
Where are you going?

14:22.462 --> 14:24.462
I'm gonna go find
some place quiet.

14:24.464 --> 14:25.463
I'll go with you.

14:25.465 --> 14:26.998
I don't want you to.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.534
I'm not a kid anymore, Luke.

14:29.536 --> 14:32.003
[scoffs] I know, I just think
someone should go with you

14:32.005 --> 14:33.438
in case something happens.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.040
There's not enough
left in there to O.D. on,

14:35.041 --> 14:36.307
if that's what you mean?

14:38.111 --> 14:39.911
Look, I know you
only look out for me

14:39.913 --> 14:42.447
because you feel guilty,
but you don't have to.

14:44.150 --> 14:46.117
What happened, it
wasn't your fault.

14:46.119 --> 14:49.554
Look, it's safer
if I'm with you.

14:49.556 --> 14:50.723
We don't this place,
what if someone...

14:50.724 --> 14:52.790
I don't want you there,
don't you get it?

14:55.061 --> 14:56.928
I hate doing this
in front of you.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.330
What?

14:59.332 --> 15:00.231
Why?

15:00.233 --> 15:04.335
Because I'm fucking
ashamed of it, that's why.

15:04.337 --> 15:07.005
I'm such a fucking
failure next to you.

15:07.974 --> 15:10.008
What do you mean, next to me?

15:10.010 --> 15:12.410
I haven't been through what you
have, there's no comparison.

15:12.412 --> 15:15.446
You have, and you
were hurt by it too.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.484
You just deal with
it better than I do.

15:21.855 --> 15:22.855
Maybe.

15:25.158 --> 15:28.626
We're just different
people I guess.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.261
I don't wanna lose you.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.564
I don't have anybody else.

15:33.566 --> 15:34.632
You won't.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.435
Not ever.

15:37.704 --> 15:40.905
I'm gonna go find
somewhere quiet to do this.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.295
[dramatic music]

16:08.034 --> 16:09.034
Hey.

16:14.808 --> 16:16.207
You can see me?

16:17.677 --> 16:19.978
Sure, what's up?

16:22.649 --> 16:24.082
You been smoking something?

16:27.721 --> 16:28.721
What?

16:30.290 --> 16:32.323
What are you doing here?

16:32.325 --> 16:34.459
I noticed you had candles.

16:35.528 --> 16:36.528
Can I use one?

16:38.431 --> 16:40.898
You are welcome to
make use of the candle,

16:42.635 --> 16:44.802
but please don't move
it out of position.

16:44.804 --> 16:48.773
I must have a candle burning
at each point of the pentagram.

16:50.543 --> 16:53.177
It protects the
sanctity of the space.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.284
You're really into
this stuff, huh?

17:02.255 --> 17:03.855
You could say that, yes.

17:05.724 --> 17:07.992
You sure you're not high?

17:07.993 --> 17:09.394
You're talking kinda weird.

17:10.195 --> 17:11.396
You mean my accent?

17:11.397 --> 17:14.832
Oh, is that what it is?

17:14.834 --> 17:15.933
I'm English.

17:17.303 --> 17:18.569
Thought you were high.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.079
MAN: What's your name?

17:29.449 --> 17:30.449
Holly.

17:34.354 --> 17:35.386
My name's Oliver.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.891
I'm very pleased
to meet you, Holly.

17:47.300 --> 17:50.101
[Holly screams]

17:50.103 --> 17:51.103
Holly?

17:53.940 --> 17:55.073
[Holly whimpering]

17:55.075 --> 17:56.240
What are you doing?

17:57.243 --> 17:58.709
Don't struggle.

17:58.711 --> 18:00.111
LUKE: Holly?

18:00.113 --> 18:02.814
[tense music]

18:04.317 --> 18:07.051
I'm afraid you're
cursed now, as am I.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.922
The symbol on your
arm is to remind you.

18:10.924 --> 18:13.758
It's the price you pay for
entering into the pentagram.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.562
But soon you'll be
free of your pain.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.534
Asmodeus, lord of despair,

18:23.536 --> 18:25.336
prince of darkness,
hear my prayer.

18:26.973 --> 18:30.908
I offer this gift to you in
the full knowledge of its cost

18:30.910 --> 18:35.246
which I bear with my heart and
my mind from this day forward.

18:39.252 --> 18:40.451
Get away from her!

18:40.453 --> 18:42.920
I'm afraid that's not possible.

18:42.922 --> 18:47.225
Holly and I have to stay
exactly where we are.

18:47.227 --> 18:48.059
What is this?

18:48.061 --> 18:49.794
A simple ritual.

18:49.796 --> 18:54.165
Some spoken words, the spilling
of blood in a pentagram.

18:55.135 --> 18:57.201
You hurt her and you're dead!

18:58.071 --> 18:59.437
That's where you're wrong.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.141
I hurt her and I live.

19:04.577 --> 19:06.144
[footsteps rapidly approaching]

19:07.347 --> 19:10.448
You got ten seconds
to drop the knife

19:10.450 --> 19:11.916
and back away from the girl.

19:14.220 --> 19:16.621
I take it you're the
man in charge here.

19:16.623 --> 19:20.158
In this fucking room, I am, yes.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.126
Well, I like your spirit,

19:22.128 --> 19:23.795
but you're going about
this all the wrong way,

19:23.796 --> 19:25.196
but I'm sure you know that.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.099
A girl like this?

19:28.101 --> 19:30.835
10 a penny on any city street.

19:30.837 --> 19:31.702
What are you talking about?

19:31.704 --> 19:33.471
I'm talking about worth.

19:33.473 --> 19:34.739
I'm talking about value.

19:36.109 --> 19:38.409
To you, she's worth nothing.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.179
A drugged up whore.

19:41.181 --> 19:44.815
But to me, in here,
she's priceless.

19:46.486 --> 19:48.187
And I'm willing to share
the value with you.

19:48.188 --> 19:50.254
Don't listen to him.

19:50.256 --> 19:51.522
He's not making any sense.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.823
It makes perfect sense

19:52.825 --> 19:54.825
to those that are
willing to listen.

19:54.827 --> 19:57.828
To those that know
what they want in life

19:57.830 --> 20:01.699
and aren't afraid to
reach out and take it.

20:03.069 --> 20:04.069
Am I right?

20:05.171 --> 20:06.003
What do you mean by value?

20:06.005 --> 20:07.805
It's quite simple.

20:07.807 --> 20:12.877
A ritual has begun, a ritual
that requires a sacrifice.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.513
And what's in return?

20:15.515 --> 20:19.550
Ah, so you understand
the concept?

20:19.552 --> 20:20.885
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.687
I heard about this shit.

20:22.689 --> 20:25.556
You sacrifice someone, you
get something in return.

20:25.558 --> 20:26.558
What is it?

20:28.628 --> 20:32.830
Power, the greatest
power you can imagine.

20:34.867 --> 20:35.867
And it's all right here.

20:37.303 --> 20:41.072
The words, the ritual,
the rewards.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.080
Let me see that.

20:50.116 --> 20:51.616
[Luke grunts]

20:51.618 --> 20:54.585
[Holly whimpering]

20:55.688 --> 20:57.555
[Lauren gasps]

20:57.557 --> 20:59.924
[sizzle sounds]
[Luke, Max, and Lauren gasping]

20:59.926 --> 21:01.192
[Lauren whimpers]

21:01.194 --> 21:04.061
What is this, why
do we all have it?

21:05.865 --> 21:08.899
It's the price you pay for
stepping inside the pentagram.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.938
You should have listened to
me when you had a chance.

21:13.940 --> 21:17.842
You're now all cursed, all
of you, just like I am.

21:17.844 --> 21:19.710
Cursed with what?

21:19.712 --> 21:21.112
A ritual was started.

21:22.649 --> 21:25.916
A ritual requiring a sacrifice.

21:36.896 --> 21:40.064
Asmodeus, lord of despair,

21:40.066 --> 21:43.267
prince of darkness,
hear my prayer.

21:46.005 --> 21:50.007
I offer this gift to you in
full knowledge of its cost,

21:50.009 --> 21:53.344
which I will bear
with my heart and mind

21:53.346 --> 21:54.912
from this day forward.

21:54.914 --> 21:55.880
[thunder crashing]

21:55.882 --> 22:00.951
In exchange, I only seek
enlightenment and the strength

22:00.953 --> 22:03.688
to carry out your
work here on Earth.

22:05.925 --> 22:09.827
Give me power, great
one, to use in your name.

22:13.633 --> 22:16.734
Asmodeus, lord of despair,

22:16.736 --> 22:18.836
prince of darkness,
hear my prayer.

22:29.415 --> 22:30.615
NATALIE: [gasps]
What are you doing?

22:30.616 --> 22:31.582
Don't step outside
the pentagram!

22:31.584 --> 22:32.450
[sizzle sound]

22:32.452 --> 22:34.518
- [Natalie cries]
- [Oliver gasps]

22:34.520 --> 22:36.487
What the hell is this?

22:36.489 --> 22:39.123
Dear God, what have you done?

22:41.260 --> 22:44.829
You've cursed the both of us.

22:44.831 --> 22:47.798
Get back in there with me,
it's the only safe place now.

22:49.302 --> 22:50.701
Screw you, Oliver!

22:50.703 --> 22:51.703
Come back!

22:54.874 --> 22:56.941
[rattling and clinking]

23:11.124 --> 23:12.022
[Natalie screams]

23:12.024 --> 23:13.024
[Oliver screams]

23:15.962 --> 23:20.064
Inside the perimeter,
it cannot see you,

23:20.066 --> 23:23.701
it cannot hear you,
but you step outside.

23:23.703 --> 23:26.404
How about we just sacrifice
your punk ass now?

23:26.406 --> 23:28.539
Nice try, good thinking.

23:30.109 --> 23:31.876
I knew you were
a kindred spirit.

23:33.546 --> 23:35.112
But it won't work, I'm afraid.

23:36.215 --> 23:40.451
My soul has long since
been bargained away.

23:40.453 --> 23:41.585
Yo, my man.

23:42.955 --> 23:44.723
You better start talking
some sense real quick.

23:44.724 --> 23:49.059
Go ahead, fire, at
least I'll be at peace.

23:49.061 --> 23:51.896
What happens if you step
outside the pentagram?

23:51.898 --> 23:53.098
Is it worse than getting
your head shot off?

23:53.099 --> 23:55.533
Wait, let me explain.

23:55.535 --> 23:56.934
We're all in this together.

23:58.604 --> 24:00.171
It's watching.

24:00.173 --> 24:01.173
It's listening.

24:02.108 --> 24:04.442
You're telling me
this thing can see us?

24:04.444 --> 24:05.876
Not inside the pentagram.

24:08.448 --> 24:09.480
But if we step out.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.783
So, we're trapped inside
this fucking circle?

24:15.721 --> 24:16.520
Yes.

24:16.522 --> 24:18.355
Bullshit, prove it!

24:20.560 --> 24:23.427
Why don't you prove it?

24:23.429 --> 24:25.629
Take a walk.

24:25.631 --> 24:27.097
See what happens.

24:31.437 --> 24:35.005
No, no, no, no, you take a walk.

24:35.007 --> 24:37.741
[Oliver groans]

24:42.181 --> 24:44.915
[Oliver groans]

24:44.917 --> 24:46.183
[rattling and clinking]

24:47.453 --> 24:49.086
Dear God.

24:49.088 --> 24:50.154
What is it?

24:52.158 --> 24:52.990
What's happening?

24:52.992 --> 24:54.825
He's coming for me.

24:55.294 --> 24:56.294
What is?

24:57.497 --> 25:00.664
I told you, you didn't
believe me, but I told you.

25:05.338 --> 25:06.770
Now, you'll see.

25:06.772 --> 25:08.239
Jesus Christ, what is that?

25:08.241 --> 25:09.406
Now, you'll see what happens

25:09.408 --> 25:12.676
when a soul is promised
and not delivered!

25:18.784 --> 25:21.785
[Oliver screaming]

25:31.697 --> 25:34.532
[birds chirping]

25:36.869 --> 25:38.569
LAUREN: Ever hear of
anything like this?

25:38.571 --> 25:40.170
Not exactly.

25:40.172 --> 25:41.705
[Holly whimpering]

25:41.707 --> 25:45.543
Knew a girl once, her creepy
boyfriend was into it, but.

25:47.013 --> 25:48.412
What happened?

25:49.515 --> 25:50.748
She wound up dead.

25:50.750 --> 25:52.683
He's doing a 20 stretch.

25:52.685 --> 25:53.918
They found pieces of her body

25:53.920 --> 25:55.386
scattered across
the neighborhood.

25:55.388 --> 25:57.755
Jesus, don't any of your
stories have a happy ending?

25:57.757 --> 25:59.857
[Holly whimpering]

25:59.859 --> 26:01.592
Holly, you okay?

26:05.131 --> 26:06.463
I need it, Luke.

26:06.465 --> 26:07.631
Okay.

26:07.633 --> 26:10.901
[tense music]

26:10.903 --> 26:11.903
Shit!

26:12.939 --> 26:16.740
Look at me, you have to
be strong, honey, okay?

26:16.742 --> 26:18.475
I'm gonna figure
a way out of this.

26:18.477 --> 26:20.045
I mean, this is some
seriously dark shit.

26:20.046 --> 26:21.545
If that guy couldn't
figure a way out,

26:21.547 --> 26:23.213
how the hell are we gonna do it?

26:24.850 --> 26:26.617
We could call someone.

26:26.619 --> 26:27.451
Oh, call someone.

26:27.453 --> 26:28.652
If we had to.

26:28.654 --> 26:29.520
What, like 911?

26:29.522 --> 26:30.521
If we had to!

26:30.523 --> 26:31.455
No fucking way.

26:31.457 --> 26:32.590
I just mean if we had to!

26:32.592 --> 26:34.158
Are you dumb?

26:34.159 --> 26:35.727
That is the stupidest
thing I ever heard.

26:35.728 --> 26:37.194
What are you gonna do,

26:37.196 --> 26:38.630
call and ask to speak to
the black magic department?

26:38.631 --> 26:41.665
We're not calling 911 no matter
what happens, you hear me?

26:41.667 --> 26:43.067
All right, forget it!

26:43.069 --> 26:45.135
Can you believe this guy?

26:45.137 --> 26:47.471
I'm stood here with $4,000

26:47.473 --> 26:49.673
in stolen cash and
an unregistered gun,

26:49.675 --> 26:51.342
and this asshat wants
to call the cops!

26:51.344 --> 26:52.576
I said forget it, all right?

26:52.578 --> 26:55.012
Will you guys just
stop fighting, huh?

26:56.916 --> 27:00.217
Maybe there is a way out.

27:01.654 --> 27:03.921
If you guys just stop
yelling at each other.

27:14.233 --> 27:16.800
[tense music]

27:20.673 --> 27:22.506
Well, this is pretty cool.

27:22.508 --> 27:24.643
You know, I was gonna get
some ink when we got to I.A.,

27:24.644 --> 27:27.578
but, what's this thing
called again, an Instagram?

27:28.347 --> 27:29.347
Pentagram.

27:30.983 --> 27:33.017
You know what, I think
I'll keep it as a souvenir.

27:33.019 --> 27:35.886
Remind me how good this
fucking lousy road trip was.

27:39.959 --> 27:41.125
He said it's a sign.

27:43.029 --> 27:44.995
To remind us we're all cursed.

27:48.067 --> 27:51.135
So if it's gone, it
means the curse is gone?

27:52.238 --> 27:54.004
I don't know, I guess.

27:58.277 --> 27:59.310
I wonder how long it takes

27:59.311 --> 28:00.911
for something like this to fade?

28:02.581 --> 28:04.114
I have a lot of scars.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.584
They never really go away.

28:19.765 --> 28:20.898
Cold?

28:20.900 --> 28:23.467
[tense music]

28:24.603 --> 28:25.603
Me too.

28:26.706 --> 28:29.139
[glass clinking]

28:29.141 --> 28:30.340
Hey, do you hear that?

28:32.712 --> 28:34.712
Is it that thing?

28:36.449 --> 28:38.082
It's coming back.

28:40.586 --> 28:42.953
We didn't step out
of the pentagram!

28:42.955 --> 28:46.757
We didn't fucking do
anything, do you hear me?

28:54.100 --> 28:56.700
I must have a candle burning

28:56.702 --> 28:59.837
at each point of the pentagram.

28:59.839 --> 29:03.006
It protects the
sanctity of the space.

29:06.145 --> 29:11.215
Candles, they have to be
burning to make it safe.

29:12.485 --> 29:15.552
There, hey, anybody got a light?

29:17.690 --> 29:20.524
[Lauren panting]
[ghostly whispers]

29:22.128 --> 29:23.594
Lighter's dead!

29:32.138 --> 29:33.138
I'm done!

29:38.577 --> 29:40.111
[rattling and clinking]
[whispers intensify]

29:40.112 --> 29:41.578
It didn't work!

29:43.115 --> 29:44.348
Put it back!

29:45.551 --> 29:48.552
There has to be
one at every point.

29:55.995 --> 29:57.115
[whispers and clinking stop]

30:01.834 --> 30:03.367
[Holly whimpers]

30:03.369 --> 30:04.768
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

30:04.770 --> 30:08.105
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

30:08.107 --> 30:12.176
- It's okay.
- [Holly sobbing]

30:14.647 --> 30:16.547
Hey, hey, you know
it's a good thing

30:16.549 --> 30:18.048
you knew what to do just now.

30:20.753 --> 30:21.753
What?

30:22.721 --> 30:24.189
Anything else you
want to share with us?

30:24.190 --> 30:27.891
Any other rules you know about
that maybe we oughta hear?

30:27.893 --> 30:29.526
Leave her alone, Max.

30:29.528 --> 30:30.661
Can't you see she's sick?

30:30.663 --> 30:32.095
Oh, I know what she is.

30:32.097 --> 30:33.097
She's a...

30:34.500 --> 30:35.566
She's a what?

30:44.009 --> 30:46.476
Shh, it's okay, it's okay.

30:46.478 --> 30:48.345
I'm gonna think of something.

31:04.196 --> 31:08.131
Did he say <i> step</i> out
of the pentagram?

31:09.568 --> 31:10.568
What?

31:11.837 --> 31:15.005
We can't <i> step</i> out, but do
you think we can reach out?

31:15.875 --> 31:17.741
Like, if we didn't
touch the ground?

31:18.544 --> 31:20.978
What are you talking about?

31:20.980 --> 31:22.379
Just thinking out loud.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.948
[tense music]

31:29.521 --> 31:32.256
[Luke grunting]

31:41.634 --> 31:42.833
Give me your hand.

31:42.835 --> 31:43.667
What?

31:43.669 --> 31:45.068
Just give me your hand!

31:47.840 --> 31:48.840
[Luke grunts]

31:51.143 --> 31:53.277
Yo, bro, I didn't
sign up for this, man.

31:54.113 --> 31:55.145
I'm sorry.

31:56.015 --> 31:57.047
I'm almost there.

32:00.119 --> 32:01.318
Lauren, grab my arm!

32:04.757 --> 32:06.223
You're pulling my
fucking arm out!

32:06.225 --> 32:07.557
I've almost got it!

32:07.559 --> 32:09.026
[Max shouts]

32:09.028 --> 32:11.295
Oh, fuck it, I can't pull me up!

32:11.297 --> 32:14.665
[Luke gasping]

32:14.667 --> 32:15.766
I almost had it.

32:17.403 --> 32:20.270
Hey, don't you ever pull a
stunt like that again, huh?

32:21.440 --> 32:22.873
You wanna take your
own life, fine,

32:22.875 --> 32:24.375
but don't fucking
pull me out with you!

32:24.376 --> 32:26.076
But I was so close!

32:26.078 --> 32:28.011
She's not worth it.

32:29.882 --> 32:30.714
What?

32:30.716 --> 32:31.648
You heard what I said.

32:31.650 --> 32:34.351
Hmm, take a look at her.

32:34.353 --> 32:36.453
She'll be dead by
the end of the night.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.388
And I'm not gonna
risk my life for that.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.160
Fine.

32:45.130 --> 32:46.130
Don't.

32:47.633 --> 32:49.967
911, emergency.

32:49.969 --> 32:51.935
Don't make me do this.

32:53.405 --> 32:55.005
Yeah, I need a medic.

32:55.007 --> 32:56.307
My sister's going
into withdrawal.

32:56.308 --> 32:57.308
No!

32:58.210 --> 33:00.277
Give me the cell phone.

33:00.279 --> 33:02.813
[tense music]

33:11.357 --> 33:13.056
Sorry, false alarm.

33:17.663 --> 33:18.663
We're fine.

33:23.302 --> 33:25.702
Yeah, just like I thought.

33:48.394 --> 33:51.028
[somber music]

33:56.001 --> 33:57.001
Sorry.

33:59.972 --> 34:01.405
I was so close.

34:04.610 --> 34:09.279
Listen, maybe Max is right.

34:09.281 --> 34:10.347
Well, kinda.

34:13.652 --> 34:18.554
I mean, I get it,
I got a sister too.

34:19.757 --> 34:20.757
I'd want to help her if I could.

34:20.759 --> 34:22.759
You don't understand.

34:24.730 --> 34:28.732
I'd risk my life for her
every day if I had to.

34:31.036 --> 34:33.103
It's the least I can do.

34:35.440 --> 34:36.739
I was so close.

34:49.521 --> 34:51.655
The bag, give me the bag.

34:54.326 --> 34:55.692
What do you want it for?

34:55.694 --> 34:57.594
Jesus Christ, Max, I
don't want the money,

34:57.596 --> 34:58.728
I just need the bag.

34:58.730 --> 35:00.263
Can I have the bag?

35:01.066 --> 35:02.066
Your funeral.

35:12.044 --> 35:14.611
[tense music]

35:49.014 --> 35:50.747
You almost had it.

35:58.123 --> 35:59.389
[Luke sighs]

35:59.391 --> 36:00.390
[Holly whimpers]

36:00.392 --> 36:02.225
It's coming, Holly, it's coming.

36:07.466 --> 36:08.798
[Luke panting]

36:08.800 --> 36:09.800
Yes!

36:34.326 --> 36:36.960
Laurs, look at this.

36:36.962 --> 36:40.463
These two, I'm telling
you, dead weights.

36:43.135 --> 36:46.036
So what, you got
a way out of here?

36:47.739 --> 36:50.874
Maybe, yeah, maybe I have.

37:10.095 --> 37:11.095
Congrats, bro.

37:12.731 --> 37:14.864
Holly lives to die another day.

37:14.866 --> 37:16.533
Just what is your problem, Max?

37:16.535 --> 37:18.702
Look around you, that's
my fucking problem.

37:18.704 --> 37:19.936
We're all in this together.

37:19.938 --> 37:22.105
I mean, why are we
even in this thing?

37:22.107 --> 37:24.341
You know, who went into
the pentagram first?

37:26.678 --> 37:28.878
We spend half our time
searching for drug dealers

37:28.880 --> 37:31.881
who aren't DEA
agents and now this.

37:31.883 --> 37:33.016
It's not her fault.

37:34.419 --> 37:37.020
You're the one who said we
should get to California.

37:37.022 --> 37:39.489
I thought that was
the whole plan.

37:39.491 --> 37:40.590
Well, plans change.

37:42.361 --> 37:43.361
I guess so.

37:44.763 --> 37:46.296
Well, look, I'm just saying,

37:46.298 --> 37:48.999
some of us are looking at the
odds of all of us getting out.

37:49.001 --> 37:52.202
And it ain't looking
so good for some of us.

37:57.342 --> 37:58.342
Max.

38:02.948 --> 38:03.948
Max.

38:06.652 --> 38:08.118
I think we've got a problem.

38:10.889 --> 38:13.923
We're meant to have five
burning candles, right?

38:13.925 --> 38:15.625
One on each point.

38:15.627 --> 38:16.627
So what?

38:17.629 --> 38:20.196
Well, look, look at
these fucking candles.

38:20.198 --> 38:21.731
There's almost nothing left.

38:28.273 --> 38:29.139
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

38:29.141 --> 38:30.707
Jesus, Max, back off!

38:31.710 --> 38:33.276
I'm just using the flashlight.

38:38.617 --> 38:42.052
I knew it, there's more
candles over there.

38:42.921 --> 38:44.220
MAX: Too far.

38:44.222 --> 38:45.555
We can use the bag.

38:45.557 --> 38:47.290
They're too fucking far.

38:59.871 --> 39:00.871
You're a genius!

39:07.946 --> 39:09.979
This is so retarded.

39:09.981 --> 39:11.981
You do it, I don't
wanna screw it up.

39:15.787 --> 39:16.986
Which one am I going for?

39:16.988 --> 39:18.521
Uh, that one.

39:20.459 --> 39:21.459
Retarded.

39:30.736 --> 39:32.902
Nice going, that
was the closest one.

39:36.708 --> 39:38.975
Just needs to be a little
longer, that's all.

39:40.746 --> 39:42.312
Here, hold this.

39:45.650 --> 39:46.650
Hold that.

39:47.686 --> 39:48.885
[suspenseful music]

39:48.887 --> 39:52.389
LAUREN: I think that
one's closest now.

39:58.630 --> 39:59.562
Yes!

39:59.564 --> 40:01.064
No, Lauren, give me the light.

40:01.066 --> 40:02.265
What happened?

40:02.267 --> 40:03.434
The candle, you blew
it out you dick!

40:03.435 --> 40:04.868
[rattling and clinking]

40:04.870 --> 40:06.803
Come on, give me the light!

40:11.109 --> 40:12.475
Give me that!

40:15.347 --> 40:17.380
[ghostly whispers]

40:23.221 --> 40:24.621
[ghostly whispers
and rattling stop]

40:24.623 --> 40:26.923
I think it's gonna work.

40:26.925 --> 40:28.124
Try that one.

40:30.061 --> 40:33.062
Max, you might want to shield
that candle just in case.

40:33.064 --> 40:34.330
No shit, Einstein.

40:39.371 --> 40:40.804
[Luke grunts]

40:40.806 --> 40:42.071
[Luke groans]

40:42.073 --> 40:42.906
Jesus, we're gonna need
five of these things.

40:42.908 --> 40:44.107
It's gonna take forever.

40:44.109 --> 40:46.042
Do you have some
place you need to be?

40:55.787 --> 40:59.923
Yes! [Laughs]

41:01.793 --> 41:03.393
Come on, can we pace this up?

41:10.735 --> 41:12.702
It's not gonna
reach any of them.

41:23.415 --> 41:26.549
I still don't think
it's gonna reach.

41:28.520 --> 41:29.686
I will, if you will.

41:38.063 --> 41:42.065
Do you two have any idea how
fucking ridiculous you look?

41:42.067 --> 41:43.533
We're all about to die

41:43.535 --> 41:46.102
and you're both busy
playing "you show me yours."

41:46.104 --> 41:47.871
What's wrong, Max?

41:47.873 --> 41:49.405
Too shy to help out?

41:49.407 --> 41:50.974
Yeah, I got my own job to do.

41:53.578 --> 41:54.978
Use the flashlight again.

42:02.254 --> 42:03.920
There, there.

42:03.922 --> 42:05.055
I'm gonna go for the
double hit, okay?

42:05.056 --> 42:06.056
Okay.

42:06.691 --> 42:09.759
[suspenseful music]

42:11.129 --> 42:12.495
[Luke and Lauren grunting]

42:12.497 --> 42:14.931
Yes! [Laughs]

42:14.933 --> 42:17.233
Get a move on, that
candle's fucking dying.

42:19.237 --> 42:20.670
Let's bring 'em in.

42:36.621 --> 42:38.354
This one's not gonna last long.

42:39.357 --> 42:41.157
Okay, quick, just one more time.

42:42.227 --> 42:44.327
Do you think it's
gonna be long enough?

42:47.699 --> 42:48.699
I think so.

42:50.101 --> 42:51.601
Hey, yo, yo, yo, yo.

42:51.603 --> 42:53.670
That is the last
candle, dog, be careful.

43:20.765 --> 43:22.832
That's it, we're fucked.

43:24.736 --> 43:26.336
You've fucking killed us.

43:29.975 --> 43:31.708
[suspenseful music]
[rattling and clinking]

43:31.710 --> 43:32.710
Look!

43:38.116 --> 43:39.582
It's coming!

43:39.584 --> 43:41.485
Your fucking retarded plan
has fucking killed us!

43:41.486 --> 43:43.786
Shut up and let me think!

43:51.630 --> 43:54.631
[ghostly whispering]

44:05.377 --> 44:06.442
[whispering subsides]

44:07.012 --> 44:09.679
[Luke panting]

44:10.782 --> 44:13.716
Holly always carries
one just in case.

44:15.820 --> 44:17.387
We did it, Lauren.

44:19.557 --> 44:21.391
We did all five.

44:21.393 --> 44:23.960
[tense music]

45:07.105 --> 45:11.507
Max, tell us about that guy.

45:12.944 --> 45:14.410
The devil-worshiper.

45:15.313 --> 45:16.779
You don't wanna hear that.

45:18.149 --> 45:19.849
Might as well talk
about something.

45:19.851 --> 45:22.251
What is this, fucking
campfire stories?

45:22.253 --> 45:25.388
Oh what, you want
us to say please?

45:30.028 --> 45:32.395
[Max sighs]

45:33.732 --> 45:36.332
Well, look, I don't know
all the details like I said,

45:36.334 --> 45:39.802
but I knew this girl, Sandy.

45:41.172 --> 45:43.706
She was mixed up with this
guy, real creepy fucker,

45:43.708 --> 45:46.843
metal pole stuck through his
face, serious Hellraiser stuff.

45:48.446 --> 45:50.747
So anyway, he and Shirley
get a place together...

45:50.749 --> 45:52.882
I thought her name was Sandy.

45:52.884 --> 45:55.051
Shirley, I said Shirley.

45:57.422 --> 45:59.555
Anyway, they get a place
together in Queens.

45:59.557 --> 46:00.958
I never saw it myself
but my cousin went there,

46:00.959 --> 46:02.458
said it was real fucked up.

46:02.460 --> 46:04.594
How come it's
always your cousin?

46:04.596 --> 46:07.096
My cousin knew the guy,
my cousin went there once.

46:07.098 --> 46:08.865
I got a lot of cousins, so what?

46:12.437 --> 46:14.904
So anyway, pretty
soon the neighbors

46:14.906 --> 46:17.240
started to give the landlord
hell because of the stink,

46:17.242 --> 46:19.609
and this guy stopped
answering his doorbell,

46:19.611 --> 46:23.780
so, after a while the cops
busted down the door.

46:23.782 --> 46:26.616
Don't tell me, they
found her body inside.

46:27.452 --> 46:28.452
No.

46:30.989 --> 46:32.288
It was chickens.

46:33.458 --> 46:34.458
What?

46:36.828 --> 46:40.096
This guy, he was only getting
live fucking chickens.

46:41.232 --> 46:42.598
They were getting them

46:42.600 --> 46:44.280
from the Chinese
restaurant down the block.

46:44.836 --> 46:46.335
And he was smuggling them in

46:46.337 --> 46:48.938
and cutting their fucking
heads off in the apartment,

46:48.940 --> 46:52.375
like some kind of ritual
shit, a sacrifice.

46:55.246 --> 46:56.246
And then,

46:58.817 --> 47:02.285
he was fucking them in the
neck, can you believe that shit?

47:02.287 --> 47:05.154
While they were still running
around alive with no head.

47:05.156 --> 47:06.690
Thought it was gonna
boost his ying yang,

47:06.691 --> 47:08.224
you know, like a sex thing.

47:09.594 --> 47:13.162
So, the whole place was stinking
of fucking chicken bones.

47:16.034 --> 47:19.235
You said he killed Sandy.

47:19.237 --> 47:20.570
See, I never said that.

47:21.673 --> 47:23.739
That was the guy from
the Chinese restaurant,

47:23.741 --> 47:26.409
cut her up with a big meat
cleaver from the kitchen.

47:29.347 --> 47:31.914
Turns out she was
screwing him on the side,

47:31.916 --> 47:34.617
and then he found out she was
also fucking the creepy dude

47:34.619 --> 47:35.885
and went mad crazy on her,

47:35.887 --> 47:38.487
but, well, that's a
whole nother story.

47:39.958 --> 47:42.525
The point is, never
fuck with a Chinaman

47:42.527 --> 47:44.060
who works with a meat cleaver.

47:45.964 --> 47:50.333
But I thought the creepy
guy was doing 20 years?

47:50.335 --> 47:54.904
No, look, after they threw
out all the dead chickens,

47:54.906 --> 47:58.174
they found a purse this guy
stole from some old lady.

47:58.176 --> 48:02.678
Turns out, she died from shock
two weeks after the robbery.

48:02.680 --> 48:05.548
They got him on second
degree homicide.

48:05.550 --> 48:06.550
Crazy, huh?

48:09.454 --> 48:10.920
So...

48:10.922 --> 48:15.191
What did the devil-worshiping
have to do with this?

48:15.193 --> 48:16.193
Nothing.

48:18.963 --> 48:20.063
They're just the only
two people I knew

48:20.064 --> 48:22.398
who were into it, that's all.

48:22.400 --> 48:25.368
[insects chirping]

48:34.812 --> 48:37.380
[eerie music]

49:06.244 --> 49:10.513
Power, the greatest
power you can imagine.

49:12.283 --> 49:13.283
And it's all right here.

49:14.919 --> 49:18.821
The words, the ritual,
the rewards.

51:26.150 --> 51:28.951
[dramatic music]

51:29.954 --> 51:30.954
Bingo.

53:25.436 --> 53:28.003
[tense music]

53:52.697 --> 53:56.131
Hey bro, time to wake up, bro.

54:00.104 --> 54:02.771
Nah, you can have an extra hour.

54:10.982 --> 54:11.982
Shh.

54:15.286 --> 54:16.885
What is it?

54:16.887 --> 54:17.953
It's time.

54:22.360 --> 54:23.492
Time for what?

54:23.494 --> 54:26.495
Time to do what we gotta
do to get out of here.

54:28.399 --> 54:29.231
LAUREN: Luke!

54:29.233 --> 54:30.733
No, no, he's okay.

54:30.735 --> 54:33.569
I just had to make sure he
didn't wake up too soon.

54:33.571 --> 54:34.803
Too soon for what?

54:34.805 --> 54:38.407
I sat here and waited while
he fixed up his sister

54:38.409 --> 54:40.509
and you two fooled
around with candles.

54:40.511 --> 54:42.044
Where did it get us?

54:42.046 --> 54:44.280
We're right back to
where we started.

54:44.282 --> 54:46.115
It bought us more time.

54:46.717 --> 54:47.717
Time?

54:49.420 --> 54:52.154
What use is time if we're
sat here pissing it away?

54:52.156 --> 54:54.123
[solemn music]

54:54.125 --> 54:56.592
There's only one way to
get out of this thing,

54:56.594 --> 54:58.227
and we both know what it is.

55:03.901 --> 55:07.636
That British guy, he told
us right from the start.

55:07.638 --> 55:09.371
Say the words, spill the blood,

55:09.373 --> 55:11.807
make the sacrifice,
complete the ritual.

55:11.809 --> 55:13.542
But we don't know
anything about that.

55:13.544 --> 55:16.645
It's all in here, he
said it, remember?

55:16.647 --> 55:18.414
He even marked the page.

55:18.416 --> 55:21.317
Everything we need to complete
the ritual is right here.

55:22.286 --> 55:23.686
There is nothing stopping us

55:23.688 --> 55:25.287
from ending this thing right now

55:25.289 --> 55:27.089
and getting the
fuck out of here.

55:28.292 --> 55:29.391
I mean, look at this.

55:30.328 --> 55:32.294
Look, she's half-dead anyway.

55:32.296 --> 55:34.196
I mean, how long do you
think she's even got?

55:35.299 --> 55:36.766
You know, I don't like
it any more than you do,

55:36.767 --> 55:38.934
but somebody's got to
make the tough decisions.

55:40.338 --> 55:42.205
Somebody's got to have the
balls to step to the plate

55:42.206 --> 55:44.373
and do what we gotta
do to get out of here.

55:46.677 --> 55:48.244
Unless you want to spend
the rest of your life

55:48.245 --> 55:50.079
stuck in this fucking circle?

55:51.549 --> 55:52.549
No.

55:54.785 --> 55:55.785
Good.

55:58.356 --> 56:00.089
Let's get started.

56:00.091 --> 56:01.123
You with me on this?

56:28.319 --> 56:30.886
[tense music]

56:35.159 --> 56:38.293
Asmodeus, lord of despair,
prince of darkness, hear...

56:38.295 --> 56:41.730
Wait, will you wait a second?

56:47.505 --> 56:48.505
Okay.

56:50.641 --> 56:52.441
Asmodeus, lord of despair,

56:52.443 --> 56:54.176
prince of darkness,
hear my prayer.

56:54.178 --> 56:56.812
I offer this gift to you in
full knowledge of its cost,

56:56.814 --> 56:57.947
which I will bear with my heart

56:57.948 --> 56:59.548
and mind from this day forward.

56:59.550 --> 57:01.483
In exchange, I seek
only enlightenment

57:01.485 --> 57:04.086
and the strength to carry
out your work here on Earth.

57:04.088 --> 57:06.822
Give me power, oh great
one, to use your name.

57:06.824 --> 57:08.157
Asmodeus, lord of despair,

57:08.159 --> 57:10.359
prince of darkness,
hear my prayer.

57:13.097 --> 57:14.963
What are you doing?

57:14.965 --> 57:16.064
I'm making a sacrifice.

57:16.066 --> 57:17.166
But I thought...

57:17.802 --> 57:18.802
What?

57:20.204 --> 57:22.271
This isn't what we said.

57:22.273 --> 57:26.375
I thought that you... I thought
you were talking about Holly.

57:27.211 --> 57:28.444
What's the difference?

57:28.446 --> 57:30.246
I already told you these
two are dead weights.

57:30.247 --> 57:31.647
We don't need 'em,
either of 'em.

57:31.649 --> 57:33.081
- But I...
- Jesus, Lauren,

57:33.083 --> 57:34.450
what do you care anyway?

57:36.187 --> 57:38.086
Unless you do care.

57:38.088 --> 57:39.154
Is that it?

57:39.156 --> 57:41.957
It matters, okay?

57:41.959 --> 57:45.093
You said that Holly
was gonna die anyway.

57:45.095 --> 57:46.528
Well, plans change.

57:49.800 --> 57:53.035
If I took out Holly, what
do you think would happen?

57:53.037 --> 57:55.904
What do you think big brother
would do when he wakes up?

57:55.906 --> 57:59.274
He's gonna take out my head,
either in here or outside.

58:00.845 --> 58:03.145
But you can't just kill him.

58:03.147 --> 58:04.746
This is the only way, Lauren.

58:05.616 --> 58:07.282
Don't you get it?

58:07.284 --> 58:08.550
This is our only chance.

58:10.721 --> 58:11.721
But... I...

58:13.190 --> 58:14.189
What do you want?

58:14.191 --> 58:17.359
That's what it
all comes down to.

58:17.361 --> 58:19.094
What, you want?
Me, money, freedom,

58:19.096 --> 58:20.296
or do you wanna
stay in this circle

58:20.297 --> 58:21.864
with these fucking losers?

58:21.866 --> 58:24.533
[solemn music]

58:27.471 --> 58:28.471
Huh.

58:30.508 --> 58:31.773
You choose him.

58:31.775 --> 58:33.976
No, no, no.
I, I would...

58:35.946 --> 58:37.012
Fine.

58:38.749 --> 58:40.582
Fuck you too.

58:40.584 --> 58:42.985
[gun fires]

58:46.390 --> 58:49.324
[Lauren chokes]

58:49.326 --> 58:52.160
[Lauren panting]

59:03.274 --> 59:04.506
Go on, take her motherfucker!

59:04.508 --> 59:06.775
Take her, I fucking
killed her, take her!

59:07.678 --> 59:09.077
What the fuck, I
said your words,

59:09.079 --> 59:11.046
I spilled her fucking
blood, I sacrificed her,

59:11.048 --> 59:13.215
now why am I still
fucking cursed?

59:15.286 --> 59:18.020
HOLLY: You did it wrong, Max.

59:23.193 --> 59:24.092
What did you say?

59:24.094 --> 59:25.661
You did it wrong.

59:28.599 --> 59:32.267
Say the words, spill with
blood, all within the pentagram,

59:32.269 --> 59:33.335
that's what he said.

59:35.472 --> 59:38.273
It doesn't work if she dies
outside the pentagram, Max.

59:40.911 --> 59:43.912
Yeah, that's right, I forgot.

59:43.914 --> 59:46.214
You know all the
rules, don't you?

59:47.284 --> 59:49.151
Well, I'll bear
that in mind, Holly.

59:53.457 --> 59:56.959
Do it. I don't care.

59:59.029 --> 01:00:01.229
I'll sit here and
I'll let it happen.

01:00:03.267 --> 01:00:05.834
Just promise me one thing.

01:00:06.437 --> 01:00:07.669
And what's that?

01:00:09.373 --> 01:00:10.539
Don't fuck it up.

01:00:15.045 --> 01:00:17.713
And make sure Luke gets out too.

01:00:17.715 --> 01:00:18.715
Uh-uh.

01:00:19.483 --> 01:00:21.783
See, I can't make that promise

01:00:21.785 --> 01:00:23.752
'cause you know as well as I do

01:00:23.754 --> 01:00:25.288
that your big brother
will chase me down

01:00:25.289 --> 01:00:26.622
to the ends of the Earth.

01:00:28.392 --> 01:00:31.360
I got two bullets
left in this bad boy,

01:00:31.362 --> 01:00:33.128
and I'm gonna give
that old demon

01:00:34.064 --> 01:00:36.732
a "two for the price of one."

01:00:40.471 --> 01:00:42.104
[dramatic music]

01:00:42.106 --> 01:00:44.206
Asmodeus, lord of despair,

01:00:44.208 --> 01:00:46.108
prince of darkness,
hear my prayer.

01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:50.612
I offer this gift to you in
full knowledge of its cost,

01:00:51.448 --> 01:00:53.248
which I will bear with my heart

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:55.317
and my mind from
this day forward.

01:00:56.453 --> 01:00:58.687
In exchange, I seek
only enlightenment

01:00:58.689 --> 01:01:01.356
and the strength to carry
out your work here on Earth.

01:01:01.358 --> 01:01:05.694
Give me power, great
one, to use in your name.

01:01:07.364 --> 01:01:09.431
Asmodeus, lord of despair,

01:01:09.433 --> 01:01:12.000
prince of darkness,
hear my prayer.

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:13.068
[Max and Luke grunting]

01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:15.570
[gun firing]

01:01:25.716 --> 01:01:26.948
Take a walk, Max.

01:01:35.092 --> 01:01:37.926
[dramatic music]
[rattling and clinking]

01:01:38.629 --> 01:01:40.362
No, no, no, no.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:43.899
Fuck.

01:01:43.901 --> 01:01:47.869
I won't give you the
satisfaction, motherfucker!

01:01:53.243 --> 01:01:54.676
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:01:57.114 --> 01:01:58.114
Fuck, fuck!

01:01:58.982 --> 01:01:59.982
Fuck, fuck.

01:02:02.119 --> 01:02:05.120
[ghostly whispering]

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:13.795
[Max screaming]

01:02:27.277 --> 01:02:30.112
[birds chirping]

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:41.757
Is this their car?

01:02:41.759 --> 01:02:44.593
Yup, recognize it anywhere.

01:02:44.595 --> 01:02:46.595
Ain't much around here.

01:02:46.597 --> 01:02:48.296
Where do you think they got to?

01:02:48.298 --> 01:02:50.565
Can't be far if they're on foot.

01:02:50.567 --> 01:02:53.101
[tense music]

01:03:18.028 --> 01:03:22.330
You know, I really thought
we were gonna make it.

01:03:24.568 --> 01:03:25.801
To I.A., I mean.

01:03:25.803 --> 01:03:30.205
It doesn't matter where
you go, New York, I.A.

01:03:31.275 --> 01:03:33.074
You take your problems with you.

01:03:36.947 --> 01:03:37.947
You were right.

01:03:39.316 --> 01:03:40.982
I should never have trusted Max.

01:03:42.519 --> 01:03:44.219
You were always too trusting.

01:03:46.657 --> 01:03:48.190
You trusted me every time I said

01:03:48.192 --> 01:03:50.759
I was gonna go out
and buy cigarettes.

01:03:50.761 --> 01:03:52.093
I don't even smoke.

01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:56.798
I guess it was easier
to lie to myself

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.166
than to admit the truth.

01:04:02.773 --> 01:04:05.106
I did some really
bad stuff, Luke.

01:04:05.108 --> 01:04:06.108
I know.

01:04:08.846 --> 01:04:10.745
I stole from people.

01:04:12.983 --> 01:04:17.252
And I screwed some, some
really disgusting guys.

01:04:17.254 --> 01:04:18.254
I know.

01:04:20.457 --> 01:04:21.457
It's okay.

01:04:23.994 --> 01:04:25.961
I just need to let
it out sometimes.

01:04:27.731 --> 01:04:29.397
And now I'm running out of time.

01:04:30.334 --> 01:04:31.366
We both are.

01:04:35.172 --> 01:04:36.538
At least we'll die together.

01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:38.106
Don't say that.

01:04:38.108 --> 01:04:40.175
There's a way out of
this and you know it,

01:04:40.177 --> 01:04:41.409
you've always known it.

01:04:43.614 --> 01:04:45.046
What are you talking about?

01:04:46.917 --> 01:04:48.817
You do what Oliver wanted to do.

01:04:49.786 --> 01:04:51.586
What Max was trying to do.

01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:55.924
You finish the ritual,
you make the sacrifice.

01:04:55.926 --> 01:04:56.926
No.

01:04:58.328 --> 01:04:59.728
- What if I wanted you to?
- No.

01:05:04.835 --> 01:05:06.601
How long do you think I have?

01:05:06.603 --> 01:05:07.669
In here or anywhere?

01:05:07.671 --> 01:05:08.737
Don't say that.

01:05:11.975 --> 01:05:17.646
If not for you, I would
have been dead in a dumpster

01:05:17.648 --> 01:05:18.780
a long time ago.

01:05:20.017 --> 01:05:21.383
Now, I can make it right.

01:05:23.186 --> 01:05:24.653
You don't owe me anything.

01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:28.156
After what my dad did to you,

01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:33.094
I owe you more than
I can ever pay back.

01:05:33.096 --> 01:05:34.096
You don't.

01:05:35.165 --> 01:05:36.531
It wasn't your
fault what happened.

01:05:36.533 --> 01:05:38.333
You can't blame yourself.

01:05:38.335 --> 01:05:41.036
I should have seen it.

01:05:41.038 --> 01:05:42.237
I could've stopped it.

01:05:44.207 --> 01:05:45.440
Luke, get real.

01:05:46.877 --> 01:05:49.044
Face it, my mom was
a desperate slut

01:05:49.046 --> 01:05:51.613
just like your dad was
an abusive asshole.

01:05:51.615 --> 01:05:53.515
It was their choice
to get hitched

01:05:53.517 --> 01:05:55.016
and they deserved each other.

01:05:57.754 --> 01:05:59.120
Me and you,

01:06:02.592 --> 01:06:05.660
we just got caught
up in the middle.

01:06:07.030 --> 01:06:11.499
She didn't deserve to die
just 'cause he was too drunk

01:06:11.501 --> 01:06:13.101
to know when to
stop hitting her.

01:06:13.103 --> 01:06:15.637
She made her own
choices, same as I did.

01:06:19.209 --> 01:06:20.442
I should've seen it.

01:06:22.646 --> 01:06:24.679
I should have seen what
he was doing to you.

01:06:31.621 --> 01:06:34.556
You know what I
remember the most?

01:06:34.558 --> 01:06:38.793
The smell of smoke on his
hands, and on his breath.

01:06:40.063 --> 01:06:42.664
The whole fucking house
smelled of it once he moved in.

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:46.901
That's why I never
smoked cigarettes.

01:06:51.308 --> 01:06:53.108
Why think about it?

01:06:54.311 --> 01:06:55.311
Don't you?

01:07:01.284 --> 01:07:02.284
All the time.

01:07:03.954 --> 01:07:06.755
[solemn music]

01:07:08.091 --> 01:07:11.493
Remember that time, that
time I got hit by that car,

01:07:11.495 --> 01:07:13.928
and you drove me
to the hospital?

01:07:15.098 --> 01:07:16.098
Sure.

01:07:17.501 --> 01:07:19.567
It wasn't an accident.

01:07:20.637 --> 01:07:21.637
What?

01:07:22.773 --> 01:07:25.473
I just closed my eyes

01:07:25.475 --> 01:07:27.375
and stepped into
the ongoing traffic.

01:07:29.646 --> 01:07:30.646
Why?

01:07:31.548 --> 01:07:33.214
He was already in jail by then.

01:07:33.216 --> 01:07:35.467
I thought, I thought everybody

01:07:35.468 --> 01:07:37.719
would be better off
without me, especially you.

01:07:37.721 --> 01:07:39.287
That's not true.

01:07:41.158 --> 01:07:42.158
It is now.

01:07:44.961 --> 01:07:45.994
What are you saying?

01:07:47.831 --> 01:07:50.432
I've been killing
myself for years, Luke.

01:07:53.336 --> 01:07:55.470
Now, maybe it's finally
worth something.

01:07:59.176 --> 01:08:01.276
This is the knife
he was gonna use.

01:08:01.278 --> 01:08:02.710
I don't want that.

01:08:02.712 --> 01:08:04.846
And you have to say the
words, the words in the book.

01:08:04.848 --> 01:08:05.980
I don't want that, Holly.

01:08:05.982 --> 01:08:07.048
Then what?

01:08:10.087 --> 01:08:11.920
Think you're gonna be a hero?

01:08:11.922 --> 01:08:14.389
Dying here with me when
you could've gotten out?

01:08:15.692 --> 01:08:16.692
You're not.

01:08:18.095 --> 01:08:19.560
It's fucking stupid.

01:08:21.163 --> 01:08:21.996
But I can't do it.

01:08:21.997 --> 01:08:24.232
You can, you have to.

01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:26.968
I'm in pain, Luke.

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:30.537
I'm in pain every
day of my life,

01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:32.407
and I can't take it anymore.

01:08:34.911 --> 01:08:39.613
Please, you have
to say the words,

01:08:39.616 --> 01:08:40.932
the words in the book,

01:08:40.933 --> 01:08:42.251
that's what he said, say
the words, spill the blood,

01:08:42.252 --> 01:08:43.384
all within the pentagram.

01:08:43.386 --> 01:08:44.886
- I...
- I need you to do it.

01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:49.691
I want you to do it.

01:08:52.328 --> 01:08:54.962
[Luke panting]

01:09:13.416 --> 01:09:16.283
[tense music]

01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:32.834
Asmodeus, lord of despair,

01:09:33.904 --> 01:09:37.404
prince of darkness,
hear my prayer.

01:09:41.144 --> 01:09:45.078
I offer this gift to you in
full knowledge of its cost,

01:09:45.081 --> 01:09:47.081
which I will bear with my heart

01:09:47.082 --> 01:09:49.917
and mind from this day forward.

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:54.856
In exchange, I seek
only enlightenment,

01:09:54.858 --> 01:09:58.760
and the strength to carry
out your work here on Earth.

01:10:03.033 --> 01:10:07.969
Give me power, oh great
one, to use in your name.

01:10:11.841 --> 01:10:15.376
Asmodeus, lord of despair,

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:21.816
prince of darkness,
hear my prayer.

01:10:31.161 --> 01:10:32.193
Do it.

01:10:34.664 --> 01:10:35.664
Set us both free.

01:10:38.068 --> 01:10:40.668
[Luke panting]

01:10:48.778 --> 01:10:51.145
[gun fires]

01:10:56.119 --> 01:10:58.519
[dramatic music]

01:10:58.521 --> 01:11:02.457
What the holy hell has
been going on here?

01:11:05.262 --> 01:11:07.495
[Holly panting]

01:11:07.497 --> 01:11:09.230
HOLLY: He's dead!

01:11:14.137 --> 01:11:16.037
Are you okay, Missy?

01:11:17.907 --> 01:11:18.907
He's dead!

01:11:20.477 --> 01:11:24.012
Well, I couldn't figure
out any other way

01:11:24.014 --> 01:11:27.215
to stop him from doing
what he was gonna do.

01:11:35.659 --> 01:11:38.493
[Holly whimpers]

01:11:43.767 --> 01:11:44.767
I'm free.

01:11:45.735 --> 01:11:46.735
What say?

01:11:49.239 --> 01:11:51.139
I'm free, I'm free!

01:11:55.178 --> 01:11:58.513
Well, I'm not too sure
about that, Missy.

01:12:00.116 --> 01:12:02.150
You sure these are
the two that did it?

01:12:02.152 --> 01:12:04.619
Yeah, that girl
was one of 'em too.

01:12:05.689 --> 01:12:08.389
Well, ain't that a
son of a bitch, Missy?

01:12:10.794 --> 01:12:14.329
You thought you were free,
and you ain't free at all.

01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:18.266
You goddamn city punks.

01:12:18.268 --> 01:12:21.803
You think I haven't seen
all this before, huh?

01:12:21.805 --> 01:12:24.639
You come into our
nice little town

01:12:24.641 --> 01:12:27.608
with your drugs
and your stealin'.

01:12:28.912 --> 01:12:30.978
Please, I'm sorry.

01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:32.480
You can call the cops.

01:12:32.482 --> 01:12:34.382
Like I told your friend, honey,

01:12:34.384 --> 01:12:36.417
that ain't how we do
things round here.

01:12:37.654 --> 01:12:38.886
The cops?

01:12:38.888 --> 01:12:41.622
All the cops want to
do is uphold the law.

01:12:42.592 --> 01:12:43.825
But the law?

01:12:43.827 --> 01:12:47.128
Well, that don't mean justice.

01:12:47.130 --> 01:12:48.763
What do you want?

01:12:49.933 --> 01:12:52.066
What do you think, Jayney?

01:12:52.068 --> 01:12:53.968
You think anybody on God's earth

01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:56.637
is gonna miss this
scrawny little whore?

01:12:58.007 --> 01:12:59.507
I surely wouldn't miss her.

01:13:01.177 --> 01:13:06.247
I think that crime
deserves a sentence,

01:13:07.650 --> 01:13:11.519
and, well, it just happens
that we have a little cell

01:13:12.322 --> 01:13:13.921
that you could do your time in.

01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:18.092
How long do you think
that should be, Jayney?

01:13:18.094 --> 01:13:20.561
For armed robbery?

01:13:20.563 --> 01:13:22.130
10 years I reckon.

01:13:24.267 --> 01:13:26.968
Damn, I'm not sure
she'd make it,

01:13:28.605 --> 01:13:33.141
especially considering all
of the punishment drills

01:13:33.143 --> 01:13:34.976
that I've got in mind for her.

01:13:36.846 --> 01:13:41.249
Now, come on, miss.

01:13:41.251 --> 01:13:42.251
Let's go.

01:13:42.919 --> 01:13:43.919
Daddy, wait.

01:13:46.055 --> 01:13:47.555
Is that our money over there?

01:13:49.225 --> 01:13:51.325
Some of it's yours, I guess.

01:13:52.729 --> 01:13:55.029
Well, it's all ours, now.

01:14:14.417 --> 01:14:18.252
[Jayney and Mr. Halsey gasp]
[sizzle sound]

01:14:19.222 --> 01:14:20.988
What in God's name is this?

01:14:23.326 --> 01:14:25.993
I guess you're just gonna
have to figure that out,

01:14:28.231 --> 01:14:29.664
same as we did.

01:14:29.666 --> 01:14:32.233
