And, Ben,
you were incredible tonight.
You did your thing.

20:22.482 --> 20:24.000
You know, shot through
the heart.

20:24.034 --> 20:25.862
You know, you'’re to blame.

20:25.896 --> 20:28.137
You gave love
a bad name, ultimately,

20:28.172 --> 20:30.000
but it was
an amazing night for you.

20:30.034 --> 20:31.827
Did you enjoy
your  LSB experience?

20:31.862 --> 20:33.344
You know, I enjoyed it
a lot. This was great.

20:33.379 --> 20:35.758
Thanks for coming out to watch.
You'’re the best.

20:35.793 --> 20:39.034
A big thanks to Ben Higgins
and Rachel Lindsay

20:39.068 --> 20:40.793
for being a part
of the  Lip Sync crew tonight.

20:40.827 --> 20:44.275
One love from me, LL Cool J,
and Chrissy.

20:44.310 --> 20:46.965
And remember,
whatever you do in life,

20:47.000 --> 20:48.655
"Knock '’em outta the box, L.

20:48.689 --> 20:50.517
Knock '’em out, L!"
