I'm a big boy. I don't need the credit.

37:28.129 --> 37:29.997
Neither of those statements is true.

37:30.031 --> 37:31.265
[Laughing] Okay.

37:31.299 --> 37:34.034
Fine. I know I'm never
getting it from Delap.

37:34.069 --> 37:36.337
10-to-1 your Dr. Rollins makes a deal,

37:36.371 --> 37:39.006
goes to some minimum-security facility

37:39.040 --> 37:40.708
for a few years for drug trafficking.

37:40.742 --> 37:45.112
Meanwhile, the <i>slave</i>
<i>he kept locked up gets what?</i>

37:45.146 --> 37:46.780
Deported?

37:46.815 --> 37:48.716
Give me <i>some</i> credit, huh?

37:49.985 --> 37:51.685
We're working on this.

37:53.288 --> 37:55.356
So, you want me to what?

37:55.390 --> 37:58.058
Support an application for a U-visa?

37:58.093 --> 38:01.395
Or should we hash it over
at midnight outside my place?

38:02.630 --> 38:04.965
Your Honor, Ms. Elata wants to go home,

38:05.000 --> 38:07.434
and believe me when I say, we
don't want to go back to yours.

38:07.469 --> 38:10.371
We're asking Main Justice
to allocate some of the money

38:10.405 --> 38:13.307
seized from Dr. Rollins
to go to Ms. Elata.

38:13.341 --> 38:15.075
If <i>you</i> were to recommend it

38:15.110 --> 38:16.744
during the forfeiture proceeding,

38:16.778 --> 38:18.545
it would go a long way.

38:18.580 --> 38:19.546
How much?

38:19.581 --> 38:20.748
$5 million.

38:20.782 --> 38:22.082
[Chuckles]

38:22.117 --> 38:26.086
Now, <i>this</i> would've been worth
interrupting my dinner.

38:29.824 --> 38:30.991
Mr. Lang. Here you go.

38:31.026 --> 38:32.960
Oh. Thank you.

38:32.994 --> 38:33.927
Good night.

38:33.962 --> 38:35.329
[Door opens, bell jingles]

38:35.363 --> 38:37.398
You're back early.

38:37.432 --> 38:38.966
Slow day?

38:39.000 --> 38:41.602
- [Door closes]
- Not exactly.

38:41.636 --> 38:43.437
- I won a trial.
- [Lock clicks]

38:43.471 --> 38:44.838
Got my client off.

38:44.873 --> 38:48.675
So, that's a good day, yes?

38:48.710 --> 38:50.811
My client was a white supremacist.

38:52.013 --> 38:56.083
I don't think he did this crime,
but he wishes he did.

38:56.117 --> 38:58.352
Still might someday.

38:58.386 --> 38:59.753
Now he's free.

39:02.190 --> 39:06.093
In Idleb, your mother has
a relative, Hanan.

39:06.127 --> 39:09.530
Second or third cousin... I forget which.

39:09.564 --> 39:11.598
Construction manager.

39:11.633 --> 39:14.868
Refused to approve an unsafe project.

39:14.903 --> 39:17.471
But someone important
in the government was behind it.

39:17.505 --> 39:20.374
They pulled her from a grocery store,

39:20.408 --> 39:22.643
shocked her with electric cables,

39:22.677 --> 39:24.611
beat, and tortured her

39:24.646 --> 39:27.682
'til she confessed to a bribe
she never took.

39:28.936 --> 39:31.771
No lawyer, no trial.

39:31.796 --> 39:35.865
Judge didn't care if she had
bruises all over her face.

39:35.890 --> 39:38.992
Three years in prison,
which... believe me...

39:39.160 --> 39:41.261
was worse than the confession.

39:43.364 --> 39:47.568
You won a trial because you <i>had</i> a trial.
