WEBVTT

01:27.588 --> 01:32.634
If you act now, we'll also include
our energy-boost protein powder.

01:32.718 --> 01:35.762
This is an exciting opportunity
to get in on the ground floor.

01:35.846 --> 01:37.514
That offer is only for the next 24 hours.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.808
Our Sonalife Daily Vitamin
is our number one product

01:39.892 --> 01:41.602
that I have my entire family use.

01:46.982 --> 01:49.318
Ai, we're going to Chipotle.
You want us to wait?

01:49.651 --> 01:51.653
Can you bring me back
the biggest burrito they have?

01:51.945 --> 01:53.655
I'm going to stay here and get the bonus.

01:54.156 --> 01:55.782
You're gonna make us look bad.

01:56.742 --> 01:58.952
Our products are backed
by a full money-back guarantee,

01:59.036 --> 02:02.998
but I've never had a customer
ask for a refund.

02:03.832 --> 02:05.959
Can I interest you in a starter pack?

02:08.836 --> 02:10.756
No, no, I'm okay.

02:11.006 --> 02:12.216
Please don't hang up.

02:12.925 --> 02:13.759
I'm pregnant.

02:14.510 --> 02:18.430
But that doesn't mean you can't save a lot
of money before I go to the hospital.

02:19.932 --> 02:22.392
Call my husband! Make sure he picks up Bo.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.144
Deep breaths, ma'am.

02:24.228 --> 02:25.771
How do you say "deep breaths" in Chinese?

02:25.854 --> 02:26.897
I speak English.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.153
She's so pretty.

02:35.322 --> 02:36.782
I just updated your chart.

02:37.366 --> 02:39.535
Everything looks great.
I'm down the hall if you need anything.

02:39.618 --> 02:40.869
I'm a brother now!

02:46.667 --> 02:47.918
Look at our family.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.257
I have to take this.

02:54.800 --> 02:55.634
Here, Bo.

02:55.968 --> 02:56.802
You're in charge.

02:57.094 --> 02:58.011
Film your sister.

03:05.102 --> 03:06.228
She's your younger sister.

03:06.687 --> 03:11.859
I'm Bo. I'm your older brother.
Don't be afraid!

03:12.901 --> 03:14.611
How are you, little sister?

05:13.730 --> 05:14.898
Aloha!

06:10.621 --> 06:11.914
Finish your broth!

06:11.997 --> 06:13.624
All the nutrients are at the bottom.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.167
-We're trying.
-We're trying.

06:15.250 --> 06:18.003
I'll pick you up at 4:00.
We can go to Noodle King for dinner.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.588
Can't. I've Welcome Wizards.

06:19.671 --> 06:20.923
I have dance rehearsal.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.467
But today is Family Friday.

06:25.677 --> 06:28.430
I'll get takeout and we can eat together
at home after.

06:28.514 --> 06:32.226
And don't worry.
I'll wait to eat until you arrive.

06:32.684 --> 06:36.188
And don't forget
we have plans tomorrow. Expo!

06:36.271 --> 06:38.398
-Again. Why?
-We're never gonna win.

06:38.482 --> 06:40.025
We're going to win.

06:40.108 --> 06:42.736
We'll win, and we'll go
on our first spring break holiday.

06:44.363 --> 06:46.865
You know your mother has good luck.

06:46.949 --> 06:48.200
You said that last year,

06:48.283 --> 06:51.703
and we spent the whole break
watching old videos and singing karaoke.

06:51.787 --> 06:53.539
I almost won last year.

06:53.622 --> 06:55.916
You can't almost win a raffle.
They just pick a name out of a bowl.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.000
Yeah.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.419
But wouldn't it be fun for the three of us
to go on an adventure together?

07:01.463 --> 07:05.300
Mom, it's okay. We don't need to go
on some fancy vacation.

07:06.009 --> 07:08.095
I gotta study for my PSATs anyway.

07:08.178 --> 07:09.096
Bye, Mom.

07:09.179 --> 07:10.848
Home early!

07:10.931 --> 07:12.307
-Bye, Mom.
-Hey.

07:14.601 --> 07:17.271
Bye-bye! I love you!

07:20.983 --> 07:21.984
Come on!

07:23.068 --> 07:26.655
You come on!
I was telling my kids I love them.

07:34.079 --> 07:35.080
Up, up, up!

07:35.163 --> 07:36.415
Expo time!

07:36.790 --> 07:39.668
Can I just have one weekend to myself?

07:39.751 --> 07:41.336
It's our lucky day.

07:41.879 --> 07:43.380
The weather is terrible.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.132
No one will want to go to the expo.

07:45.507 --> 07:47.217
We're still not gonna win.

07:48.010 --> 07:51.096
I told you, you have to wear socks.

07:51.180 --> 07:54.558
Or your blood will freeze
and your heart will stop.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.935
That's never happened to anyone, ever.

07:57.019 --> 07:58.103
Tell that to Feng Hua.

07:58.187 --> 08:01.940
She was 93 and she had cancer.
Just go without us.

08:05.569 --> 08:11.200
It is the storm of the century, everybody.
Stay home. Stay safe.

08:11.283 --> 08:14.244
And whatever you do, stay off the road.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.961
Not many people here today.

08:25.464 --> 08:26.924
Under the Tuscan Sun.

08:32.135 --> 08:33.138
Feeling lucky.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.349
All right.

08:35.933 --> 08:41.020
And the winner
of the grand prize Alaskan cruise is...

08:41.647 --> 08:43.565
Ai Wang.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.534
It's the biggest boat ever!

08:53.617 --> 08:54.868
Oh, my God.

08:55.369 --> 08:56.620
Race you to the ship!

08:58.205 --> 09:00.040
I'll give you a ten-second head start.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.459
Come on. Hurry up!

09:05.212 --> 09:07.714
C'mon, hurry up. We can't be late.

09:31.363 --> 09:33.824
-You're upset about this shirt?
-Bo-Bo.

09:36.243 --> 09:39.037
Hello, hello, hello,
and welcome to the Grand Americana.

09:39.454 --> 09:42.791
They call me Craig
because my name is Craig.

09:44.877 --> 09:46.086
You got it.

09:46.170 --> 09:49.173
Anyhoo, I'm gonna be
your dedicated cruise concierge.

09:49.715 --> 09:54.178
We have a wide range of activities,
like panning for gold, totem pole carving.

09:54.261 --> 09:58.724
But for my money, the best part of
this cruise is sunrise on the roof deck.

09:59.308 --> 10:02.686
All that Alaskan majesty.
Talk about Mother Nature showing off.

10:03.604 --> 10:07.232
Okay. You guys are Room 1104, so you're
gonna take the elevators down the hall.

10:07.316 --> 10:08.317
Bo, get the luggage.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.361
And tonight, join the captain on the deck
for cocktails and mocktails.

10:11.653 --> 10:12.821
Family photo?

10:13.447 --> 10:14.656
Yes. Hold on.

10:16.658 --> 10:18.202
No, Mom. Come on.

10:21.705 --> 10:22.706
Mom.

10:28.420 --> 10:30.631
We have a balcony and everything!

10:30.714 --> 10:32.591
Take off your shoes!

10:34.176 --> 10:35.719
-Check it out!
-Oh, my gosh!

10:35.802 --> 10:38.096
Look at that view!
I can't believe this.

10:38.180 --> 10:39.723
-I can't believe you won this, Mom.
-Oh, my gosh!

10:39.806 --> 10:41.433
Bo! Bo! Bo! Hit it!

10:41.517 --> 10:43.644
-Don't you dare!
-Mom! Mom! Catch!

10:44.228 --> 10:46.438
You guys, I just saw a dolphin!

10:46.522 --> 10:48.440
Bo-Bo! I can't believe we're here.

10:53.946 --> 10:55.989
This is the biggest restaurant
I've ever seen.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.534
I'm gonna get a Shirley Temple.

10:58.992 --> 10:59.993
Enjoy your meal.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.121
We'll take a private table.

11:03.205 --> 11:05.874
We are the Getaway Expo
grand prize winners.

11:05.958 --> 11:07.084
All seating's communal.

11:07.918 --> 11:11.463
Your first cruise. Come on.
Have a seat. We'll give you the rundown.

11:12.214 --> 11:15.175
A little tip,
don't go crazy at the salad bar.

11:15.259 --> 11:18.095
They're just trying to fill you up
before the prime rib.

11:18.762 --> 11:22.432
Save your appetite for the main event.
What's your name?

11:23.684 --> 11:25.561
Tell them I don't speak English.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.396
Don't be weird, please.

11:27.479 --> 11:30.274
I didn't come to this cruise
to talk to other people.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.317
I came to talk to my kids.

11:34.570 --> 11:37.948
My mom's name is Ai.
She doesn't really speak English.

11:42.286 --> 11:43.287
Cheng.

11:46.915 --> 11:51.962
What we're seeing here
is the unparalleled beauty of ice calving,

11:52.045 --> 11:55.465
the breaking away of icebergs
from the glacier itself.

11:55.549 --> 11:56.758
Mom?

11:56.842 --> 11:58.886
Can I go to teen club?
Just, like, for an hour?

11:59.928 --> 12:01.346
Don't leave.

12:01.430 --> 12:03.891
We're going to find out
about baby seals next.

12:05.517 --> 12:07.936
I'm so happy we're here together.

12:08.312 --> 12:11.023
Harbor seals like to stay close to home.

12:11.815 --> 12:18.238
And much like humans, the gestation period
for a baby seal pup is nine months.

13:12.334 --> 13:13.335
Hey, Bo!

13:14.044 --> 13:15.337
Reapply your sunscreen.

13:16.171 --> 13:17.506
You'll get skin cancer!

13:17.589 --> 13:19.091
I already have sunscreen on.

13:19.174 --> 13:22.052
But you know the sun
makes your acne flare up.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.262
Mom!

13:23.345 --> 13:24.888
It's natural. It's puberty.

13:30.102 --> 13:31.520
Where are you going?

13:31.603 --> 13:34.565
Everyone's going to teen club,
and I wanna try out my new Magic deck.

13:35.732 --> 13:36.567
Fine.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.653
Cheng and I will go see the king crabs.

13:39.736 --> 13:40.904
I heard they're mating.

13:41.905 --> 13:42.906
I'm going with Cheng.

13:43.448 --> 13:44.783
You sure you don't want to go?

13:45.158 --> 13:48.996
Actually, teen club has
a hair-braiding workshop I wanna go to.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.373
Okay. That sounds fun.

13:51.582 --> 13:52.791
I can learn to braid your hair.

13:53.125 --> 13:55.210
It's not really how it works, Mom.

13:57.546 --> 13:59.798
Teen club's just for teens and preteens.

14:00.299 --> 14:02.134
But we'll see you at dinner, okay?

14:03.510 --> 14:04.553
Oh. Yeah.

14:04.970 --> 14:06.263
Dinner starts at 5:00 p.m.

14:06.638 --> 14:09.183
Get there on time
so you can help me order.

14:09.266 --> 14:10.225
Great. Have fun.

14:10.309 --> 14:11.435
Bye.

14:12.519 --> 14:13.520
Love you!

14:22.154 --> 14:25.616
From relaxing pursuits
and enriching activities

14:25.699 --> 14:28.619
to world-class entertainment
and gourmet cuisine,

14:28.702 --> 14:32.372
we have everything to make
your vacation dreams come true.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.046
When you step aboard
our Alaskan cruise lines,

14:39.129 --> 14:42.966
you're setting a course for a world
of amazing new discoveries.

15:35.853 --> 15:37.479
Are you seriously having another beer?

15:37.563 --> 15:39.147
Yeah, I'm on vacation.

15:43.068 --> 15:45.320
It was so sick, you know?

15:45.404 --> 15:47.364
Yeah, totally. Nice.

15:47.447 --> 15:48.991
You're late.

15:50.117 --> 15:51.118
Barely.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.996
It's 5:14!
We said 5:00 p.m. sharp.

15:54.580 --> 15:56.248
I waited all day for you.

15:56.331 --> 15:57.666
You just waited for us all day?

15:59.209 --> 16:00.961
No. I did lots of stuff.

16:01.044 --> 16:02.796
Plenty of stuff.

16:02.880 --> 16:04.089
Like what?

16:05.632 --> 16:09.261
Guess what I did. I learned how
to French braid, and I made this bracelet.

16:10.262 --> 16:12.347
-Yo!
-Oh, dude, what's up?

16:13.599 --> 16:18.228
You must be Bo's mom.
I'm Theresa. I'm Sean's aunt.

16:18.604 --> 16:21.064
Isn't it fantastic the boys made friends?

16:21.523 --> 16:24.484
The best thing about a cruise
is that these kids just get lost.

16:26.320 --> 16:28.447
I mean, "Get out of my hair," right?

16:31.533 --> 16:32.993
Save me.

16:33.327 --> 16:37.247
Anyway, Sean told me that you're divorced.
I'm gonna take care of you.

16:37.331 --> 16:40.375
How about you and I hit karaoke tomorrow?

16:40.918 --> 16:42.377
Karaoke.

16:42.836 --> 16:44.379
Sounds fun.

16:44.588 --> 16:46.924
I'm not doing karaoke with this woman.

16:47.633 --> 16:50.511
So, I'm gonna come find you tomorrow.
Okay?

16:50.594 --> 16:53.263
-Okay. Okay.
-Okay.

16:54.223 --> 16:55.974
-Come on.
-Later, dude.

16:56.642 --> 16:58.977
Today was so cool.
Sean and I played Magic.

16:59.061 --> 17:01.730
I pulled out a bird of paradise
on the first draw. It was awesome.

17:02.898 --> 17:04.483
Isn't this place amazing, Mom?

17:12.531 --> 17:13.700
Wake up! Wake up!

17:15.327 --> 17:17.037
They were out of bacon at the buffet.

17:18.121 --> 17:19.748
But they had turkey sausage.

17:43.021 --> 17:45.774
There she is, my grand prize winner.
How can I help you?

17:45.858 --> 17:48.235
I need a map of the ship.
I need to know where kids go.

17:48.694 --> 17:51.613
Can't find your kids, huh?
Yep. We see it all the time.

17:51.697 --> 17:54.867
Usually happens on the third day.
I'm sure they're having a great time.

17:54.950 --> 17:57.995
Now, why don't we find something fun
for Mom to do?

17:59.496 --> 18:02.332
Here, you could lie out on the deck,
smell that fresh sea air.

18:02.416 --> 18:04.042
You should enjoy it. Take advantage.

18:04.126 --> 18:07.421
By the way, did you take my advice
and check out the top deck at sunrise?

18:08.005 --> 18:09.339
My kids would not wake up.

18:09.882 --> 18:12.092
Well, you don't need your kids
to enjoy a sunrise.

18:13.135 --> 18:14.595
Here we have water aerobics.

18:14.678 --> 18:17.848
You could get your fitness on,
move a little bit. Okay, no.

18:18.182 --> 18:19.308
There's singo.

18:19.391 --> 18:21.768
-"Singo"?
-Singles bingo. Really fun.

18:21.852 --> 18:24.855
-I don't date.
-Okay. Do you gamble?

18:26.607 --> 18:27.774
I am lucky.

18:27.858 --> 18:29.776
Okay. There's something.

18:33.655 --> 18:35.365
Hey, Tristan. Can I get a starter pack?

18:36.116 --> 18:37.117
Thank you.

18:37.618 --> 18:38.619
Thanks.

18:39.036 --> 18:42.956
Okay, a little freebie. You got
a five-dollar token and a drink ticket.

18:43.040 --> 18:44.625
It's good for any bar on the ship.

18:45.083 --> 18:48.712
I gotta get back to my station, but,
remember, I'm always here if you need me.

18:56.595 --> 19:01.225
What we're seeing here is
the unparalleled beauty of ice calving...

19:02.935 --> 19:06.313
the breaking away
of icebergs from the glacier itself.

19:40.097 --> 19:41.890
Bo, Cheng. Let's go.

19:42.432 --> 19:43.767
I'm in the middle of a game.

19:44.434 --> 19:45.853
Boom. Six damage.

19:46.645 --> 19:47.771
I said let's go.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.356
Mom, he's about to win.

19:49.940 --> 19:51.567
Are you trying to ultimate Jace?

19:53.318 --> 19:54.862
Bo, I'm speaking to you.

19:54.945 --> 19:56.113
One sec.

19:57.614 --> 19:59.283
-Now!
-Mom!

20:00.117 --> 20:01.285
Really?

20:02.244 --> 20:03.495
Okay, that's a tilt.

20:03.579 --> 20:05.747
It doesn't matter if it's your mom,
but that's a forfeit. I win.

20:05.831 --> 20:07.416
We're on vacation together.

20:07.499 --> 20:08.584
How could you leave me?

20:09.042 --> 20:10.544
I was alone all day.

20:10.627 --> 20:13.213
What are you even talking about?
You were alone for one day.

20:13.297 --> 20:18.051
"Bo, kiss me on the cheek. Bo, order this.
Bo, talk for me." What is wrong with you?

20:24.224 --> 20:28.020
It's okay, Mom.
I'll go get him and meet you at dinner.

20:52.294 --> 20:54.963
So, are you having a good cruise, or what?

21:00.594 --> 21:03.305
No. It's sad.

21:05.682 --> 21:07.392
Everyone here is sad.

21:07.476 --> 21:10.896
Well, yeah.
But that's everywhere, isn't it?

21:11.980 --> 21:14.942
I mean, at least here
they give you all-you-can-eat shrimp.

21:34.670 --> 21:36.672
One glass of red wine, please.

21:51.728 --> 21:53.730
Do you have any soda?

21:55.065 --> 21:57.442
Ginger ale in-- Yes.

21:59.444 --> 22:01.321
Yes. I never drink.

22:01.864 --> 22:02.865
Thank you.

22:19.464 --> 22:20.591
One more.

22:23.927 --> 22:25.137
Blackjack.

22:27.014 --> 22:31.310
Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets.
Last chance to place your bets.

22:33.187 --> 22:36.565
And we've got an eight.
Lucky number eight.

23:10.724 --> 23:13.894
All right. Karaoke night continues.

23:14.436 --> 23:18.482
And let's see,
up next are Gail and Ben from Kansas.

23:20.442 --> 23:22.402
They had one stood up forever.

23:29.576 --> 23:31.662
Yeah! You got this.

23:50.222 --> 23:55.477
When I said I needed you

23:56.562 --> 24:01.149
You said you would always stay

24:02.651 --> 24:06.697
It wasn't me who changed, but you

24:07.281 --> 24:13.161
And now you've gone away

24:14.830 --> 24:20.377
Don't you see that now you've gone

24:21.503 --> 24:26.717
And I'm left here on my own

24:27.843 --> 24:32.556
That I have to follow you

24:32.639 --> 24:39.188
And beg you to come home

24:39.271 --> 24:42.316
You don't have to say you love me

24:42.399 --> 24:44.943
Just be close at hand

24:45.611 --> 24:48.530
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand

24:49.698 --> 24:50.908
Wake up.

24:51.575 --> 24:55.579
Believe me, believe me
I can't help but love you

24:55.662 --> 24:57.414
You're making the right decision.

24:57.998 --> 24:59.458
Believe me

24:59.541 --> 25:04.963
I'll never tie you down

25:05.589 --> 25:07.382
Left alone with just memories

25:07.466 --> 25:10.135
We've had her two years.

25:10.928 --> 25:12.679
She's very healthy.

25:12.971 --> 25:14.431
We wouldn't want to give her up,

25:14.515 --> 25:16.016
but we've been blessed
with a child of our own.

25:16.099 --> 25:16.934
A boy.

25:20.437 --> 25:22.648
You're good luck.

25:23.315 --> 25:27.903
There's nothing left to feel

25:29.238 --> 25:30.239
Dad!

25:31.281 --> 25:32.282
Mom!

25:33.158 --> 25:35.494
Just be close at hand

25:36.036 --> 25:41.792
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand

25:42.125 --> 25:48.715
Believe me, believe me

25:48.799 --> 25:54.429
You don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand

25:55.013 --> 26:01.019
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand

26:01.103 --> 26:07.234
Believe me, believe me

26:07.317 --> 26:14.241
Believe me

26:15.826 --> 26:17.077
Yeah!

26:19.454 --> 26:20.873
Good job.

26:46.356 --> 26:48.317
Mom, is that you?

26:48.859 --> 26:50.027
Yes, Bo-Bo.

26:58.160 --> 26:59.161
Thanks, Mom.
