00:02.044 --> 00:03.580
[narrator] Previously on Lost:

00:03.671 --> 00:05.172
You brought me to operate.

00:05.256 --> 00:08.293
You think I trust you,
that I'm gonna just do the surgery

00:08.384 --> 00:10.295
and hope that you let me go?

00:10.386 --> 00:13.753
Jack... you have to do it.

00:13.848 --> 00:16.464
How did they get you to ask me?
What did they offer?

00:16.559 --> 00:18.015
- Nothing!
- Why are you here?

00:18.102 --> 00:19.967
They're gonna kill Sawyer!

00:26.402 --> 00:28.142
Tomorrow morning, first thing.

00:28.237 --> 00:30.478
I'll get it out,
and I'll keep you alive.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.201
I'm ready.

00:34.827 --> 00:38.115
No! No! Sawyer, please!

00:38.206 --> 00:39.992
You get your hands off of him!

00:42.543 --> 00:44.955
[Jack] I made a small incision
in Ben's kidney sack.

00:45.630 --> 00:48.997
Now, if I don't stitch that back up
in the next hour, he's dead.

00:49.091 --> 00:51.707
Now get in here
and bring that walkie-talkie!

01:39.100 --> 01:40.385
Hello.

02:22.518 --> 02:24.884
[grunts]

02:24.979 --> 02:26.310
I fell asleep?

02:26.397 --> 02:29.139
With candles burning.
That's real safe.

02:34.697 --> 02:36.858
We don't have to
keep doing this, you know.

02:37.658 --> 02:41.446
Are you saying that because
you don't think it's gonna work?

02:41.537 --> 02:43.744
Or because you're afraid
he'll find out?

02:47.710 --> 02:49.621
Lift up your shirt.

03:02.558 --> 03:04.264
[whimpers]

03:06.771 --> 03:08.056
OK.

03:10.608 --> 03:13.520
- Some doctor you are.
- I'm not doing this as your doctor,

03:13.611 --> 03:15.476
I'm doing it as your sister.

03:18.115 --> 03:20.026
I don't like you being here alone.

03:20.117 --> 03:21.698
Come stay with me.

03:21.786 --> 03:24.778
I like living on the beach.

03:24.872 --> 03:27.705
This is Miami, Rachel.

03:27.792 --> 03:29.999
Everything's on the beach.

03:32.922 --> 03:36.460
[rapid beeping]

03:36.550 --> 03:38.836
[Jack] You have an hour head start.

03:38.928 --> 03:40.668
Take the walkie, take Sawyer, go.

03:40.763 --> 03:42.128
[Kate] Wait, where are you?

03:42.223 --> 03:45.807
[Jack] Kate, just listen to me! Do you
remember what I told you on the beach?

03:45.893 --> 03:49.306
Do you remember what story I told you
when you were stitching me up?

03:50.147 --> 03:53.435
- Do you remember it?
- Yes! Yes! I remember!

03:54.402 --> 03:58.395
When you get safe,
you radio me and you tell me that story.

03:58.489 --> 03:59.478
Jack, please...

03:59.573 --> 04:03.191
If you don't call in an hour, I'll know
something went wrong and he dies!

04:03.536 --> 04:06.073
- / can't leave without you!
- Yes, you are. Go.

04:06.163 --> 04:08.245
- Jack, I can't!
- Go! Now!

04:08.332 --> 04:11.244
- I can't!
- Kate! Damn it! Run!

04:16.465 --> 04:19.252
Juliet, stop the bleeding
and stitch him up.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.675
She's not a surgeon.
She can't fix this.

04:24.181 --> 04:25.512
He's right.

04:28.144 --> 04:29.304
[groans]

04:34.692 --> 04:35.977
Let's go.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.936
- [machine buzzes] Warning.
- Sawyer, let's go!

04:41.031 --> 04:42.111
- Warning.
- Sawyer!

04:42.199 --> 04:45.566
- [zapping]
- [babbling]

04:54.378 --> 04:57.620
Then what the hell
do you suggest we do?

04:59.341 --> 05:03.129
Go get Danny,
then find Austen and Ford

05:03.220 --> 05:04.471
and bring them back.

05:04.555 --> 05:07.217
No. You do that and Ben dies.

05:07.308 --> 05:09.515
- Go.
- No, you think I'm lying?

05:09.602 --> 05:12.435
You think that this is a bluff?
lwill let him die.

05:12.521 --> 05:14.057
No. Jack. You won't.

05:16.192 --> 05:18.604
Go. Get them back.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.523
If you have to...

05:22.740 --> 05:24.071
...kill them.

05:51.644 --> 05:53.635
- [beeping]
- [buzzing]

05:58.025 --> 05:59.686
[phone ringing]

06:03.781 --> 06:05.271
- Hello?
- [woman] Dr. Burke?

06:05.366 --> 06:08.108
- Yes.
- It's Diana from Mitte/os BioScience.

06:08.202 --> 06:11.035
- Conﬁrming your appointment tomorrow.
- 2:00, right?

06:11.121 --> 06:14.909
2:00. Dr. Alpert asked me to tell you
he's looking forward to meeting you.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.161
- Me, too. Thank you.
- Goodbye.

06:43.487 --> 06:46.604
- [chattering]
- [door closes]

06:59.545 --> 07:01.410
[giggling]

07:02.881 --> 07:07.250
[phone ringing]

07:09.346 --> 07:10.677
Stay here.

07:15.477 --> 07:18.514
- Hello, Juliet.
- Hey.

07:21.358 --> 07:23.144
Hey, Ed.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.399
Why exactly are you here?

07:27.489 --> 07:30.481
Oh, I, um... today's lab work,

07:30.576 --> 07:34.239
I got home and I realized
that l inverted some numbers.

07:34.330 --> 07:36.116
It couldn't wait until morning?

07:38.375 --> 07:41.708
- Edmund?
- I'm sorry.

07:42.004 --> 07:43.244
How rude of me.

07:43.339 --> 07:46.706
Juliet, this is Sherry.
Sherry, this is Juliet...

07:47.092 --> 07:49.128
...my ex-wife.

07:52.056 --> 07:53.546
Juliet's leaving.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.219
lam.

07:59.772 --> 08:01.558
Jules...

08:02.399 --> 08:05.732
...could you please turn off the lights?

08:15.871 --> 08:17.486
[rapid beeping]

08:17.581 --> 08:20.914
You haven't thought this through.
Your plan's not going to work.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.582
Yeah? Why's that?

08:22.670 --> 08:26.458
Your friends won't make it to your side,
because we're not on that island.

08:28.342 --> 08:30.924
We're on a smaller island,
two miles offshore.

08:33.097 --> 08:34.803
Afraid so.

08:39.603 --> 08:43.937
So, why don't we see if we can come up
with some kind of peaceful resolution.

08:46.568 --> 08:48.854
- A peaceful resolution?
- That's right.

08:48.946 --> 08:52.655
Is that what you call asking me to kill
Ben while on the operating table?

08:52.741 --> 08:55.323
- "Make it look like an accident"?
- Ridiculous.

08:55.411 --> 08:58.869
- What are you trying to do, Jack?
- She said if I did, she'd protect me!

08:58.956 --> 09:00.537
Enough!

09:03.419 --> 09:06.331
Juliet, get out.

09:07.381 --> 09:10.669
- Tom, he's lying!
- You said you can't stitch him up?

09:10.759 --> 09:13.592
Then you don't need to be in here.

09:13.679 --> 09:14.794
Go, Julie.

09:22.271 --> 09:24.227
Don't let him fool you.

09:24.314 --> 09:26.930
He'll never let a patient just die.

09:31.655 --> 09:33.065
Hey!

09:33.157 --> 09:35.364
Hey! Can anybody hear me?

09:38.162 --> 09:40.323
- What happened?
- Open the cage!

09:40.414 --> 09:42.996
- Where's...
- Just open the damn cage!

10:02.019 --> 10:03.634
That's our island?

10:03.729 --> 10:05.515
You didn't believe me before?

10:05.606 --> 10:06.766
We need a boat.

10:06.857 --> 10:08.939
And a couple of towels
and a buffet lunch.

10:09.026 --> 10:11.563
We'll follow the beach.
There's got to be one.

10:11.653 --> 10:13.609
How else do they get back and forth?

10:13.697 --> 10:16.734
Well, why don't we just
stop and ask for directions?

10:19.453 --> 10:21.785
- Jack, are you there?
- Yeah.

10:21.872 --> 10:23.612
- Yeah, I’m here.
- Are you OK?

10:23.707 --> 10:26.119
- I’m fine.
- Tell him I said hi. Get to the point!

10:26.210 --> 10:29.748
Jack, we need a boat. We need
some way to get off of this island.

10:30.672 --> 10:32.879
You heard her.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.877
How do they get off this island?

10:36.887 --> 10:38.468
- What's he doing?
- [gunshot]

10:38.555 --> 10:39.715
Kate? Kate!

10:39.807 --> 10:41.217
- [gunshot]
- [gaSping]

10:42.893 --> 10:44.303
[gunshots]

10:44.394 --> 10:45.725
Kate!

10:50.234 --> 10:51.474
Come on!

11:02.871 --> 11:04.736
Come on! Go! Go, go!

11:30.941 --> 11:32.556
- [grunts]
- [thud]

11:35.696 --> 11:37.277
This way!

11:38.323 --> 11:39.984
[Pickett] Jason, you all right?

11:42.953 --> 11:44.159
They're over there!

11:53.380 --> 11:56.167
Come on! Get inside! Get inside! Go!

12:01.138 --> 12:02.844
Come on!

12:06.476 --> 12:08.512
[Pickett] Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet!

12:10.814 --> 12:12.179
Sh, Shh.

12:12.274 --> 12:13.354
Be quiet...

12:14.860 --> 12:16.396
Where'd they go?

12:16.486 --> 12:17.942
That way.

12:28.123 --> 12:29.988
Nice to meet you, Sheena.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.909
- [rapid beeping]
- [Tom] Is it true?

12:34.004 --> 12:36.370
- Is what true?
- What you said.

12:37.341 --> 12:39.878
Did Juliet really ask you to kill him?

12:41.929 --> 12:45.638
Yeah, and in about 40 minutes,
she's gonna get her wish.

12:45.724 --> 12:47.089
[Ben] Hey...

12:52.856 --> 12:56.064
That's not helping...

12:57.027 --> 12:58.392
...anything.

13:02.658 --> 13:04.694
Now...

13:05.369 --> 13:08.861
...could somebody please get Juliet?

13:18.924 --> 13:20.539
[woman] Juliet?

13:21.385 --> 13:23.467
Edmund wants to see you in his office.

13:25.222 --> 13:27.213
Do you work here?

13:27.307 --> 13:29.389
I'm the new research assistant.

13:31.186 --> 13:33.177
Of course you are.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.031
lwant in.

13:51.540 --> 13:54.953
- In on what?
- I know what you're doing, Juliet.

13:57.212 --> 14:00.170
- I'm not really sure what you...
- | read your notes.

14:01.008 --> 14:02.669
I know what you took from the lab.

14:02.759 --> 14:04.499
The only thing I don't know is...

14:05.846 --> 14:07.552
...who's your guinea pig?

14:10.267 --> 14:11.973
Ed, I've...

14:12.060 --> 14:16.224
I've been doing my research
in my own lab on my own time.

14:16.314 --> 14:19.181
- I don't really see how...
- It's your sister, isn't it?

14:21.361 --> 14:24.853
Look, Jules, there's two ways
this plays out.

14:26.074 --> 14:30.317
One is your research is potentially...

14:30.412 --> 14:31.743
...genius.

14:33.123 --> 14:34.488
And the other...

14:35.208 --> 14:38.792
...it raises some very
serious ethical questions.

14:39.671 --> 14:42.287
Maybe even criminal concerns.

14:43.592 --> 14:45.958
But if you collaborate with me...

14:47.763 --> 14:50.675
...based on my reputation,

14:50.766 --> 14:54.805
all this is viewed
as cutting-edge science.

14:55.187 --> 14:59.931
And we will win prizes
and drink champagne...

15:01.401 --> 15:03.778
...and do a lot of good for people.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.995
Why don't I give you time
to think about it?

15:33.058 --> 15:34.468
[Tom] Juliet.

15:37.020 --> 15:38.521
Ben's awake.

15:40.357 --> 15:41.392
How?

15:41.775 --> 15:46.314
Shephard says he's a spinal surgeon,
not an anesthesiologist.

15:47.864 --> 15:49.900
Ben's asking for you.

15:59.292 --> 16:02.580
This a hobby of yours, Underdog,
digging holes?

16:02.671 --> 16:06.163
Yep. That and basket weaving.
Want one?

16:08.301 --> 16:11.634
- Have a tunnel to the mainland?
- No, but I've got a boat.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.509
- Can we use it?
- Yeah.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.216
- But we've got to hurry.
- Hold on a second, sister.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.802
You happen to find us
in the woods, you have a boat

16:20.897 --> 16:22.888
and you're gonna let us use it?

16:24.401 --> 16:27.143
- There's something we need to do first.
- Oh, gee.

16:27.237 --> 16:29.603
My boyfriend is being held prisoner.

16:29.698 --> 16:33.486
If you help me rescue him, I promise
I'll get you back to the other island.

16:34.077 --> 16:35.988
Your boyfriend,

16:36.079 --> 16:38.616
his name happen to be "Karl"?

16:40.750 --> 16:42.581
Yeah.

16:43.587 --> 16:45.248
Come on.

16:46.047 --> 16:49.084
[rapid beeping]

16:49.176 --> 16:53.340
- I stopped the surgery.
- I know.

16:53.430 --> 16:56.922
I've been able to hear you
for a few minutes now.

16:58.185 --> 17:00.267
It's very clever of you.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.309
I should have seen it coming.

17:04.774 --> 17:07.436
- Are you in pain? I can...
- No.

17:08.653 --> 17:10.689
But thanks all the same.

17:24.211 --> 17:27.703
I'd like to speak to Juliet alone,
please, Jack.

17:27.797 --> 17:29.378
No, no, I'm sorry.

17:29.466 --> 17:33.004
Please. I'm asking you.

17:33.094 --> 17:35.927
One gentleman to another.

17:36.973 --> 17:40.431
It won't hurt you to give me
three minutes, will it?

17:41.978 --> 17:45.391
Knowing l have only 27 left.

17:58.828 --> 18:01.319
- If you touch him, if you try to...
- I won't.

18:06.127 --> 18:07.708
You've got three minutes.

18:31.987 --> 18:33.568
l'm Tom, by the way.

18:54.551 --> 18:56.667
They've got history.

19:14.696 --> 19:16.812
I would like for you
to go back in there,

19:16.906 --> 19:19.397
put Ben under and finish the surgery.

19:21.745 --> 19:24.452
And why would I wanna do that?

19:24.539 --> 19:27.326
Because I'm going to go
help your friends escape.

19:39.095 --> 19:42.838
[man] Thank you for taking the time
to let us make our pitch, Dr. Burke.

19:42.932 --> 19:47.346
Mittelos BioScience is based in Oregon,
we're just outside of Portland.

19:49.022 --> 19:51.263
[chuckles]

19:51.358 --> 19:55.522
These shots might seem cheeseball,
but our people really are this happy.

19:55.612 --> 20:00.231
Now, why? Because we're privately
funded. Privately funded means freedom.

20:03.453 --> 20:06.695
We organize trips every week
in and around the Portland area,

20:06.790 --> 20:11.159
which is just awesome for hiking,
and biking, and river running.

20:13.338 --> 20:18.002
Look, when your company
reached out to me, l was flattered,

20:18.093 --> 20:20.379
but I don't really know why
you would want me.

20:20.470 --> 20:24.839
Is it true that you successfully
impregnated a male field mouse?

20:26.434 --> 20:28.766
Well, he didn't carry to term.

20:29.813 --> 20:32.646
- You mind if I ask you something?
- Sure.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.768
What do you see?

20:40.657 --> 20:43.865
Well... it's a human womb, obviously.

20:44.452 --> 20:49.071
Judging from the decomposition of the
endometrium, I'd say the woman was 70.

20:49.165 --> 20:53.408
- Actually, she's 26.
- What happened to her?

20:53.503 --> 20:57.496
What if I told you that you could have
complete freedom and money to find out?

20:59.467 --> 21:02.049
We think you're special, Dr. Burke.

21:02.137 --> 21:04.628
We want you to lead a team
of highly trained people

21:04.722 --> 21:07.099
because we think
you're just that good.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.507
I can't.

21:10.186 --> 21:12.142
Why can't you?

21:12.230 --> 21:14.266
My ex-husband wouldn't let me.

21:14.357 --> 21:17.269
- He wouldn't give you this opportunity?
- No.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.191
He would never give the OK.

21:19.279 --> 21:21.770
- We could reach out to him.
- Don't bother.

21:21.865 --> 21:25.733
- Must be something he'd respond to.
- If he were hit by a bus.

21:25.827 --> 21:27.067
That would work.

21:30.874 --> 21:33.035
- That was totally inappropriate.
- No.

21:36.045 --> 21:38.297
I'm sorry that I wasted your time.

21:39.007 --> 21:41.464
- Dr. Burke, please, you...
- No. I'm sorry.

21:42.218 --> 21:45.051
Whatever you think I am, I'm not.

21:45.972 --> 21:48.588
I'm not a leader, Mr. Alpert.

21:49.267 --> 21:51.098
I'm a mess.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.473
Oh, hell.

22:47.617 --> 22:49.573
Karl's gotta be in there.

22:49.661 --> 22:51.652
What, you mean you ain't sure?

22:52.121 --> 22:54.248
It's the only place I haven't looked.

22:54.332 --> 22:57.074
- You know the guard?
- Yeah.

22:57.168 --> 23:00.205
- His name's Aldo.
- "Aldo"?

23:01.422 --> 23:06.007
OK, Lollipop, tell me how we're gonna
get by him with one gun and no bullets?

23:06.094 --> 23:08.050
I've got an idea.

23:08.805 --> 23:10.386
Of course you do.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.512
- Open the door!
- Alex?

23:14.602 --> 23:16.058
What the hell are you doing?

23:16.145 --> 23:19.808
They got out of their cages! I caught
them in the jungle. Now open up!

23:19.899 --> 23:24.233
Just stop! You're not supposed to be
here. Your dad's gonna kill you!

23:24.320 --> 23:28.029
My dad was the one who told me
to bring them here, to you.

23:28.116 --> 23:32.450
Look, maybe you should call him.
I'm sure he's got nothing better to do.

23:39.836 --> 23:44.626
- Danny, I need Ben.
- [Danny] Why?

23:44.716 --> 23:47.628
I got Alex here, she's got
Austen and Ford with her...

23:49.596 --> 23:51.882
Damn it! Whatever she says
don't believe it!

23:51.973 --> 23:54.180
You hold them right there,
I’m on my...

23:54.976 --> 23:59.470
Don't get mad at me because you fell
for the old Wookiee Prisoner gag.

23:59.939 --> 24:02.931
- Where's Karl?
- What are you talking about?

24:03.026 --> 24:05.017
Shoot him in the knee.

24:05.945 --> 24:08.436
- What?
- We don't have time. I'll do it.

24:10.867 --> 24:14.576
OK! All right! He's at the end of the
hall! Room 23! Keys are in my pocket!

24:21.544 --> 24:24.206
Good con, I almost believed
you were gonna shoot him.

24:24.297 --> 24:25.753
It wasn't a con.

24:26.716 --> 24:28.001
Here it is!

24:28.092 --> 24:29.878
[muffled up-tempo music]

24:29.969 --> 24:32.085
I ain't feeling this.

24:34.098 --> 24:40.094
[loud, shrill up-tempo music]

25:35.576 --> 25:36.656
[Kate] Help!

25:37.120 --> 25:38.235
Help!

25:46.713 --> 25:49.204
You're OK. You're OK, Karl.

26:00.810 --> 26:01.799
Is he OK?

26:01.894 --> 26:04.636
We got your boyfriend back.
Where's your damn boat?

26:11.446 --> 26:13.402
- [grunts]
- Idiot.

26:13.489 --> 26:16.196
- Where are they?
- I don't know. Alex was with them.

26:16.284 --> 26:18.115
[Juliet] Danny!

26:19.662 --> 26:21.072
We're letting them go.

26:21.164 --> 26:23.325
- Letting 'em go?
- Ben gave the order.

26:23.416 --> 26:25.407
- Ben's in surgery.
- He woke up.

26:25.501 --> 26:27.753
- He woke up, huh?
- Shephard won't do the surgery

26:27.837 --> 26:32.171
unless he knows his friends are off
the island. Do you want Ben to die?

26:32.258 --> 26:35.546
I know Ben would rather die
than let them go!

26:49.692 --> 26:51.273
Hey.

26:52.361 --> 26:53.862
How was the interview?

26:55.406 --> 26:57.112
It's not for me.

26:57.450 --> 26:59.566
- What?
- It's fine.

26:59.660 --> 27:02.367
They're too far away anyway.
It's Portland.

27:02.455 --> 27:06.573
- You didn't say no because of me?
- Why would I want to go to Portland

27:06.667 --> 27:08.794
for research that doesn't even work?

27:10.713 --> 27:12.578
Because it does work.

27:19.180 --> 27:20.886
I'm pregnant.

27:25.102 --> 27:27.184
l'm p... I'm pregnant.

27:28.689 --> 27:31.396
- What?
- Look, look...

27:31.484 --> 27:33.065
I took a blood test, too.

27:33.152 --> 27:35.359
I didn't want to tell you
till I was sure.

27:38.699 --> 27:40.610
- It worked.
- Yeah.

27:41.994 --> 27:45.703
[laughing]

27:47.250 --> 27:50.492
[sobbing] My whole life,
all I ever wanted was to have a baby

27:50.586 --> 27:53.043
and now because of you I can!

27:58.094 --> 28:00.255
God, now | just need to get healthy!

28:01.848 --> 28:03.930
Now | just need to get healthy

28:04.016 --> 28:06.974
so I can see the bugger
get into an Ivy League school.

28:08.479 --> 28:11.186
Of course you will. You will.

28:11.274 --> 28:15.313
Now you can tell that bastard ex-husband
of yours what he can do with his ethics.

28:19.740 --> 28:22.948
Because you're insufferable,
and you're mean.

28:23.744 --> 28:26.201
You asked me for the truth,
Mom, and that's...

28:26.289 --> 28:27.950
Ed.

28:28.958 --> 28:32.450
Let me call you later, OK?
OK, bye.

28:32.545 --> 28:35.787
- Hello, Jules. What's up?
- She's pregnant.

28:37.049 --> 28:39.961
- Excuse me?
- It worked. Rachel's pregnant.

28:43.222 --> 28:47.056
Jul... Juliet, that's...

28:47.143 --> 28:49.634
Wow.

28:49.729 --> 28:53.142
I need to see your labs.
We'll have to verify the data.

28:53.232 --> 28:55.018
No.

28:55.109 --> 28:57.270
I'm not interested in publishing, Ed.

28:58.321 --> 28:59.982
It's my sister.

29:00.072 --> 29:03.280
Fine. If you're not interested,
why are you concerned if...

29:04.452 --> 29:06.443
[tires screeching]

29:14.503 --> 29:18.496
[rapid beeping]

29:23.346 --> 29:26.679
- You OK?
- Yeah.

29:26.766 --> 29:29.178
| just don't like blood too much.

29:29.685 --> 29:34.179
Well, then you probably
won't want to be looking at that.

29:37.860 --> 29:40.772
So, if you really
can get off the island,

29:40.863 --> 29:43.104
why didn't you just
take him to a facility?

29:43.199 --> 29:45.281
Why all this?

29:45.368 --> 29:48.280
Because ever since
the sky turned purple, we...

29:48.371 --> 29:49.531
[frantic beeping]

29:49.622 --> 29:53.365
- What the hell happened?
- ljust nicked an artery.

29:53.834 --> 29:58.168
- Isn't that what you already did?
- Yeah, well, that was on purpose.

29:59.215 --> 30:00.375
Can you fix it?

30:01.801 --> 30:02.881
Damn it!

30:09.058 --> 30:10.548
- You got him?
- I got him.

30:12.895 --> 30:14.305
- [Kate] Karl?
- Nice ride.

30:14.397 --> 30:17.104
- [Kate] Karl, we're gonna go now.
- Help me.

30:17.191 --> 30:20.524
[Kate] Can you stand? OK. Come on.

30:23.239 --> 30:26.902
So... you're the boss's daughter?

30:27.743 --> 30:31.235
I never saw that coming.
Let's go, Cheech.

30:32.081 --> 30:34.493
We're going for a little ride.

30:34.583 --> 30:36.915
- Careful.
- All right. Easy.

30:38.004 --> 30:40.165
I'm gonna put you in the boat,
all right?

30:41.090 --> 30:42.751
Wait, wait.

30:45.344 --> 30:46.504
- Are you OK?
- Danny.

30:46.595 --> 30:48.335
No. "Sawyer."

30:49.348 --> 30:51.259
Danny!

31:05.114 --> 31:07.526
- No!
- Danny!

31:25.009 --> 31:26.840
- What happened? Is he...?
- I can't see.

31:26.927 --> 31:29.054
- What?
- There's too much blood.

31:29.138 --> 31:30.844
All right, get over here.

31:30.931 --> 31:33.764
Tom, he is going to die
if you don't get over here now.

31:37.813 --> 31:39.314
Go.

31:40.941 --> 31:42.477
Get out of here.

31:44.111 --> 31:45.647
You heard the lady.

31:47.948 --> 31:50.325
- Let's go!
- Not you, Alex.

31:51.243 --> 31:53.825
- You're staying.
- Why?

31:53.913 --> 31:55.449
We both know your father.

31:55.539 --> 31:59.031
And the only way he'll let Karl live
is if you're here when he wakes up.

32:02.963 --> 32:04.794
I'm sorry, Alex.

32:13.557 --> 32:15.263
Hey, Alex.

32:15.351 --> 32:16.966
Hey.

32:17.686 --> 32:19.768
I missed you.

32:19.855 --> 32:22.938
I know. I missed you, too.

32:25.027 --> 32:27.609
You have to go away now...

32:27.696 --> 32:30.312
...but I'll see you real soon, OK?

32:30.991 --> 32:32.197
I love you.

32:38.040 --> 32:39.576
l have to go to sleep now.

32:52.221 --> 32:53.301
Wait.

32:55.307 --> 32:58.640
- [frantic beeping]
- [Jack] Easy. OK. Easy.

33:01.897 --> 33:03.512
Wait, wait...

33:03.607 --> 33:06.474
Keep it steady, damn it!
Hold it steady.

33:09.238 --> 33:11.069
[Kate] Jack, are you there?

33:16.078 --> 33:19.570
All right, hold that up to me.
The walkie. Hold it up to me.

33:19.665 --> 33:22.077
- What about the suction?
- Just do it!

33:28.924 --> 33:30.664
Yeah, I'm here, Kate. You OK?

33:31.677 --> 33:35.420
Yeah, I... We've got a boat.
They're letting us go.

33:35.890 --> 33:37.096
Who's letting you go?

33:38.684 --> 33:40.424
The blonde woman.

33:40.519 --> 33:43.636
- So you're safe? You and Sawyer?
- Yes! Yeah.

33:43.981 --> 33:46.814
- Tell me.
- Tell you?

33:47.401 --> 33:50.268
On the beach, the day of the crash,
the story I told you.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.569
If you're safe, tell me.

33:52.656 --> 33:55.568
- You think this is the best time to...
- Shut up!

33:57.870 --> 34:01.579
You... were doing surgery on a girl.

34:04.126 --> 34:05.832
And you messed up.

34:05.920 --> 34:07.456
You made a mistake.

34:09.381 --> 34:13.624
You tore something on her back
and all the nerves came loose.

34:17.640 --> 34:19.722
And you said you were so afraid.

34:22.186 --> 34:24.051
And you said the fear was so...

34:26.273 --> 34:27.774
...real.

34:28.943 --> 34:30.934
And you didn't know what to do.

34:35.574 --> 34:37.360
[sobbing] So you counted to five.

34:40.871 --> 34:43.578
And then you weren't afraid anymore.

34:43.666 --> 34:46.829
- [normal beeping]
- And then it was just gone.

34:51.006 --> 34:52.507
And you fixed her.

34:53.842 --> 34:55.833
You saved her.

35:14.530 --> 35:16.862
I need you to make me a promise, Kate.

35:16.949 --> 35:18.280
Jack?

35:18.367 --> 35:21.200
Promise me that you'll never
come back here for me.

35:23.455 --> 35:24.740
Don't come back, Kate.

35:24.832 --> 35:27.619
- Jack, where are you? Please.
- Turn it off.

35:27.710 --> 35:31.202
- Jack? Jack! Please, where are... ?
- [turns off radio]

35:31.880 --> 35:34.257
[static hissing]

35:42.933 --> 35:44.309
Trades are coming up.

35:46.979 --> 35:48.844
We gotta go.

35:52.359 --> 35:54.065
- Let's go.
- OK.

36:43.494 --> 36:45.826
We have some paperwork
we need you to sign...

36:46.622 --> 36:48.738
...but take your time,
there's no rush.

36:48.832 --> 36:50.333
Thank you.

37:17.361 --> 37:21.855
[crying]

37:26.620 --> 37:30.989
[stabilized beeping]

37:53.021 --> 37:55.148
Were you able to remove the tumor?

37:58.652 --> 38:00.017
Yeah.

38:04.032 --> 38:06.944
You'll want to do a biopsy,
see if it's malignant.

38:12.458 --> 38:16.042
So, what now?
| just go back to my cell?

38:17.171 --> 38:19.412
Until they figure out
what to do with you.

38:23.969 --> 38:25.470
"They."

38:30.767 --> 38:32.018
What'd he say?

38:33.103 --> 38:35.480
- I'm sorry?
- Ben.

38:36.398 --> 38:38.980
What did he say that made you
want to save his life?

38:43.405 --> 38:45.396
It doesn't really matter what he said.

38:45.491 --> 38:46.776
It matters to me.

38:48.744 --> 38:52.328
After everything that
l have been put through...

38:53.790 --> 38:55.917
...you owe me an answer.

38:56.919 --> 38:58.955
And I wanna know what he said.

39:18.232 --> 39:19.267
[man] Tissue?

39:20.150 --> 39:22.732
Thank you. Thanks.

39:33.580 --> 39:36.822
- Have we met?
- [Alpert] Hello, Dr. Burke.

39:39.294 --> 39:43.412
- Mr. Alpert?
- I'm... so sorry for your loss.

39:45.801 --> 39:47.416
What are you doing here?

39:47.511 --> 39:51.720
I saw what happened on the news and
your office said you were down here.

39:51.807 --> 39:55.049
| just wanted to express
my condolences in person

39:55.143 --> 39:56.804
before I went back to Portland.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.977
This is Ethan,
he's one of my colleagues.

39:59.064 --> 40:00.804
It's a pleasure to meet you.

40:07.781 --> 40:09.567
He was hit by a bus.

40:09.658 --> 40:12.741
I know. They say you were there
when it happened. It must...

40:12.828 --> 40:15.820
No, no. In our interview...

40:17.374 --> 40:21.083
I said... I said that I wanted...
I wanted him to get hit by a bus.

40:23.797 --> 40:26.914
Dr. Burke, I realize you're
a little shook up right now,

40:27.009 --> 40:29.375
but this is just a tragic accident.

40:29.469 --> 40:31.130
You can't blame yourself.

40:32.014 --> 40:34.175
I don't even remember you saying that.

40:39.354 --> 40:41.936
Why are you here, Mr. Alpert?

40:42.024 --> 40:45.642
Look... I know the timing is horrible,

40:45.736 --> 40:50.196
but we came because we're that serious
about getting you to come work with us.

40:53.368 --> 40:55.108
Just give us six months.

40:55.203 --> 40:58.787
If you need to, you can be back
before your sister gives birth.

41:01.043 --> 41:03.705
- How did you know that my...?
- We're very thorough

41:03.795 --> 41:05.535
in our recruitment process.

41:15.474 --> 41:18.637
- Can my sister come?
- Won't work, we're pretty remote.

41:18.727 --> 41:21.560
She wouldn't have access
to the treatment that she needs.

41:21.647 --> 41:24.639
But it's Portland.
There's plenty of clinics and...

41:24.733 --> 41:28.225
Well, actually...
We're not quite in Portland.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.908
I want to know what he said.

41:47.089 --> 41:50.832
I've been on this island
for three years, Jack.

41:50.926 --> 41:54.919
Three years, two months, and 28 days.

41:58.517 --> 42:00.178
He said that if I...

42:02.437 --> 42:04.018
...let him live...

42:05.982 --> 42:07.768
...and I helped you...

42:13.240 --> 42:15.982
...that he would finally
let me go home.
