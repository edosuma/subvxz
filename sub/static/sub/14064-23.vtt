WEBVTT

00:02.068 --> 00:03.558
Previously on Boston Legal.

00:03.670 --> 00:05.695
I used to work on
the Texas Innocence Project.

00:05.805 --> 00:08.774
One of my cases is up on appeal.
I could use your help.

00:08.875 --> 00:11.708
I'm looking for the best lawyer
I can find. I think that's you.

00:11.811 --> 00:14.712
- I don't like jibber-jabber in my courtroom.
- Oh, my goodness.

00:14.814 --> 00:17.180
- That's as far as you should go.
- Shejust kissed you?

00:17.283 --> 00:20.514
- I'm not gonna pursue it.
- He shoots a client in the knee.

00:20.620 --> 00:24.249
- He then shoots a homeless man
with a paintball gun.

00:24.357 --> 00:27.588
- Could you kindly point in any
direction other than my head?

00:27.694 --> 00:29.127
It's not loaded.

00:29.229 --> 00:31.891
- Oh, I guess it is.
- For God's sake, Denny!

00:38.905 --> 00:43.171
It's just that I feel
my song is still in me.

00:43.276 --> 00:45.642
- What song?
- My song.

00:45.745 --> 00:48.805
Everybody has a song in them, Sydney.
You should know that.

00:48.915 --> 00:51.748
Oh, I see.
And yours is still unsung.

00:51.851 --> 00:53.751
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

00:53.853 --> 00:56.151
I mean, here I am in my 70s...

00:56.256 --> 01:00.886
and I still feel that everything
I wanted to express in life...

01:00.994 --> 01:06.455
is still bottled up inside me
like a- a kidney stone.

01:08.168 --> 01:10.830
Talk to me, Sydney.
What are you thinking?

01:10.937 --> 01:14.134
- I think you're bored, Denny.
- Bored?

01:14.240 --> 01:16.435
How can I be bored?
I'm Denny Crane.

01:16.543 --> 01:18.773
Even the sound
of my name fascinates.

01:18.878 --> 01:22.075
More, Sydney.
More about me.

01:22.182 --> 01:24.377
Yeah. Okay.

01:25.485 --> 01:27.749
Well, I think...

01:27.854 --> 01:30.789
that you are a silver-spoon-fed...

01:30.890 --> 01:33.415
rich, empty sack...

01:33.526 --> 01:36.427
who has nothing to do now
but count his money...

01:36.529 --> 01:39.760
or spend it on hookers...

01:39.866 --> 01:43.825
and therapists who offer up
some form of affirmation.

01:43.937 --> 01:46.132
And, frankly, I'm sick of it!

01:46.239 --> 01:49.367
I would no longer even treat you...

01:49.476 --> 01:52.104
but for the $600 an hour I charge.

01:52.212 --> 01:54.476
Which sum, I might assure you...

01:54.581 --> 01:57.277
is meant to deter
your recurring visits.

01:57.383 --> 01:59.214
Do you understand me, Denny?

01:59.319 --> 02:03.346
I would sooner leap from the window
than see your lips move...

02:03.456 --> 02:06.323
the sight of which
is the visual cue...

02:06.426 --> 02:10.362
that feculent blather
is about to spew forth.

02:12.198 --> 02:15.133
This is no way for a therapist
to talk to a patient.

02:15.235 --> 02:19.035
My official medical recommendation
would be that you take yoga classes...

02:19.139 --> 02:23.633
so that you might gain the necessary flexibility
to stick your head up your ass.

02:30.717 --> 02:33.618
I- I do feel like
an empty sack sometimes.

02:33.720 --> 02:37.850
It occasions depression. It even caused me
to buy a handgun to end it.

02:37.957 --> 02:40.926
I even carry it around with me...

02:41.027 --> 02:46.192
never knowing when I might
decide to join the ranks of the unliving.

02:46.299 --> 02:50.531
And then I think to myself,
how unoriginal.

02:50.637 --> 02:53.504
Suicide is so ordinary.

02:53.606 --> 02:56.234
But...

02:56.342 --> 02:59.402
if I were to shoot
my doctor-

02:59.512 --> 03:01.446
Well!

03:01.548 --> 03:03.448
Ah, now, but, you see, Denny...

03:03.550 --> 03:06.212
that would result in you
actually accomplishing something real.

03:06.319 --> 03:08.617
You see?
Something actual...

03:08.721 --> 03:13.886
as opposed to the manufactured heroics
of your publicist, the mad cow-

03:13.993 --> 03:18.521
And then it suddenly might matter-
really matter- that you were born.

03:18.631 --> 03:22.226
And-And how would you
handle that after 70-plus years...

03:22.335 --> 03:24.565
of unmitigated insignificance?

03:27.974 --> 03:31.432
- You don't think I matter?
- Oh, pull the trigger, Denny! Do something...

03:31.544 --> 03:35.241
to rise above your insipid
press releases!

03:35.348 --> 03:38.215
All the meaninglessness!
Just pull it!

03:38.318 --> 03:40.809
You think I won't?

03:40.920 --> 03:43.616
Actually, I happen to know you will.
I happen to know you must.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.817
You see, you're pointing a gun
at a therapist...

03:46.926 --> 03:49.656
who's not only got
a death wish of his own...

03:49.762 --> 03:53.220
but also a life insurance policy
which excludes suicide.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.665
And, you see, Denny,
I've often wondered...

03:55.768 --> 04:00.000
how can I possibly end my life without
forfeiting my son's Harvard education?

04:00.106 --> 04:03.234
But if I were to be
murdered, then-

04:03.343 --> 04:05.311
So...

04:06.746 --> 04:10.512
you must shoot me,
or I will shoot you.

04:10.617 --> 04:12.983
Go ahead. Pull the trigger,
or I will kill you.

04:16.189 --> 04:18.987
- Okay, Sydney.
- Pull it.

04:19.091 --> 04:22.186
- I'm not gonna shoot you. Don't be ridiculous.
- Then you must die.

04:22.295 --> 04:26.425
- Come on, Sydney. Game's over.
- Give you the count of three. One-

04:27.533 --> 04:29.433
- Sydney.
- Two.

04:29.535 --> 04:31.867
- For God's sake.
- Three.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.217
What now?

05:25.325 --> 05:27.020
Denny shot his therapist.

05:27.126 --> 05:30.095
Dear God. Paintball?

05:30.196 --> 05:33.256
- Real bullets.
- Is he-

05:33.366 --> 05:36.358
No. The man is apparently going to survive.
He's in the hospital.

05:36.469 --> 05:39.438
Denny's in custody.
Where's Alan?

05:41.307 --> 05:44.037
It's not that I'm not ready, Your Honor!

05:44.143 --> 05:47.772
It's that I was called for trial.
Division Six, Judge Holt.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.848
Judge Holt doesn't
control my courtroom.

05:49.949 --> 05:53.180
I told you the last time there'd be
no further continuances.

05:53.286 --> 05:55.584
I cannot be in two places
at the same time!

05:55.688 --> 05:59.021
- You should've gotten somebody else from your office to cover.
- Somebody else?

05:59.125 --> 06:01.423
The public defender's office
is so overextended.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.893
So's the D. A. 's office.
He's here and ready.

06:03.996 --> 06:08.023
Of course he's ready.
Because they prioritize the racial profiling cases.

06:08.134 --> 06:11.433
- I object to that, Your Honor.
- The truth is we shouldn't even be here!

06:11.537 --> 06:16.304
Save it for trial, counsel. Which will begin
tomorrow, either with or without you.

06:16.409 --> 06:18.104
Adjourned.

06:25.685 --> 06:27.778
Excuse me.
I couldn't help but overhear...

06:27.887 --> 06:30.185
which is so often
the case when people shout.

06:30.289 --> 06:33.315
My name is Alan Shore.
I'm an extraordinary attorney.

06:33.426 --> 06:37.226
I could tell you stories.
But more incredibly, I'm available.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.460
Alan.

06:43.569 --> 06:46.265
- Chelina.
- Oh, my God.

06:46.372 --> 06:48.932
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

06:49.041 --> 06:51.100
How are you?

06:51.210 --> 06:54.839
Today, a little dyspeptic.
But in general, I'm splendid.

06:54.947 --> 06:58.781
- God. The last time I saw you-
- I think it was a Sunday.

06:58.885 --> 07:03.447
Then I was taken off the air. You went off to
do movies. Then I got switched to Tuesdays and-

07:03.556 --> 07:05.649
Here we are, with old footage.

07:05.758 --> 07:09.091
Exactly.
You look smashing.

07:10.363 --> 07:12.331
And you're black.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.332
- Sorry?
- This is fate.

07:14.434 --> 07:17.460
I just took a case where
I think race was a factor.

07:17.570 --> 07:20.903
Profiling. I'd love to
exploit you...

07:21.007 --> 07:23.498
which I believe
you invited me to do once.

07:23.609 --> 07:25.941
- I meant sexually.
- Yes.

07:26.045 --> 07:31.108
So, this case involves persecution,
civil rights- all the good stuff.

07:31.217 --> 07:34.015
- Can Legal Aid spare you? The client's indigent.
- Alan...

07:34.120 --> 07:37.180
the last time we worked together,
I kissed you.

07:37.290 --> 07:40.453
Really? I'd forgotten.
You'll have to refresh me on that.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.824
Excuse me.

07:44.730 --> 07:47.130
My lover.

07:47.233 --> 07:49.861
Hello, Denny.

07:49.969 --> 07:52.699
You did what?

08:21.667 --> 08:24.329
- I thought he was a quail.
- I'm not laughing.

08:24.437 --> 08:26.997
It was total self-defense.

08:27.106 --> 08:30.598
After I threatened to kill him,
the bastard threatened to kill me. It's not right.

08:30.710 --> 08:33.178
- Why were you carrying the gun?
- I have a constitutional right to.

08:33.279 --> 08:35.246
- Not a concealed weapon.
- Oh, yes, I do.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.248
And the Supreme Court's
gonna say so.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.341
Just as soon as they finish
overturning Roe v. Wade.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.587
Denny, this time
you've gone way too far.

08:43.688 --> 08:45.850
You always say that.

08:45.958 --> 08:49.018
No, I don't. Paul Lewiston does.
And besides, you shot a man. Another man.

08:49.128 --> 08:53.258
I'm telling you I had no choice.
The man was gonna kill me.

08:53.366 --> 08:56.563
He could go tojail for this.
I mean, how could he avoid it?

08:56.669 --> 08:58.569
First of all,
he's claiming self-defense.

08:58.671 --> 09:01.469
Second, the guy's apparently okay.
He just took it in the clavicle.

09:01.574 --> 09:05.567
- Third, I'm talking about Denny. He shoots people all the time.
- Well, you're probably right.

09:05.678 --> 09:08.476
He's probably already booked
himself on Larry King Live.

09:11.017 --> 09:13.952
- What's happening with Sandy?
- Nothing.

09:14.053 --> 09:16.578
- I thought you were gonna-
- Nothing's happening with Sandy.

09:16.689 --> 09:19.590
- Didn't you have your big second-
- Nothing's happening with Sandy.

09:21.761 --> 09:24.491
She dumped me.

09:24.597 --> 09:26.827
I'm sorry.

09:26.933 --> 09:29.902
- Did she say why?
- Does it really matter?

09:30.002 --> 09:34.336
Brad, while I appreciate how deeply guarded
you are, you need to share more.

09:34.440 --> 09:37.637
- I mean, you don't have any friends to talk to.
- I have plenty.

09:37.743 --> 09:40.507
Name three.

09:40.613 --> 09:42.911
What happened?

09:43.015 --> 09:45.108
You know, I'm going to tell you.

09:45.217 --> 09:49.415
Just to see if the look on your face
remotely matches the look on mine when she-

09:49.522 --> 09:51.786
- You know why she dumped me?
- Hmm?

09:51.891 --> 09:54.587
Because I'm a lousy kisser.

09:54.694 --> 09:56.958
Yeah. Exactly my reaction.

09:57.063 --> 09:59.896
Well, um, all I can say...

09:59.999 --> 10:01.967
if that is in fact
the reason-

10:02.068 --> 10:04.127
- It is.
- You're sure?

10:04.236 --> 10:06.329
- I called an ex-girlfriend. She confirmed it.
- Confirmed?

10:06.439 --> 10:09.806
I'm the worst kisser
in the history of the planet.

10:09.909 --> 10:11.433
Oh.

10:11.544 --> 10:13.876
Yeah. Let me ask you something.

10:13.980 --> 10:16.710
Is it really that important
in the scheme of a relationship...

10:16.816 --> 10:20.217
and all its potential, including but not
limited to the parenting of children-

10:20.319 --> 10:22.549
Is how a man kisses
really that important?

10:22.655 --> 10:26.716
Well, at the beginning,
all the promise of romance...

10:26.826 --> 10:28.138
and forgive me,
but the magic, it's-

10:28.173 --> 10:29.450
and forgive me,
but the magic, it's-

10:29.562 --> 10:31.496
Yes, it's in the kiss.

10:31.597 --> 10:34.566
Women are always complaining
about not being taken seriously.

10:34.667 --> 10:37.966
And you look at the leading women's
magazines- Vogue, Cosmopolitan-

10:38.070 --> 10:42.803
it's always about "How do I get a man?"
"How do I look?" "How do I please a man in bed?"

10:42.908 --> 10:47.038
And now I discover they're willing to measure
the substance of a relationship with a kiss.

10:47.146 --> 10:51.139
It isn't men who demean women.
It's women.

11:00.593 --> 11:02.493
Hey. Alan. How's it going?

11:02.595 --> 11:05.496
Fine. Thanks. How are you?
You can get back to me on that.

11:05.598 --> 11:08.658
If there's something trapped in there,
I encourage you to let it out quickly.

11:08.768 --> 11:10.929
I'm due in court.

11:11.037 --> 11:14.564
Well, I was wondering if I could join you
and Denny on the balcony sometime.

11:14.674 --> 11:18.303
Just trying to diversify
my life with some male bonding...

11:18.411 --> 11:20.936
and I was wondering, you know-

11:21.047 --> 11:24.539
Brad, any gathering of three or more men
always seems like a team to me...

11:24.650 --> 11:26.641
and I've never been
much of a team player.

11:26.752 --> 11:28.720
So if you're going to show,
count me out.

11:28.821 --> 11:31.790
But is there something specific
you'd like to talk about?

11:34.160 --> 11:36.128
Are you a good kisser?

11:45.237 --> 11:48.206
Case number 62345.

11:48.307 --> 11:50.707
The Commonwealth versus
Denny Crane. Attempted-

11:50.810 --> 11:54.143
Alan Shore for the defendant.
We'll waive reading of the charges.

11:54.246 --> 11:57.374
- Oh, dear God, it's you.
- I know who I am, counsel.

11:57.483 --> 11:59.815
You don't need to tell me it's me.

11:59.919 --> 12:02.149
I know perfectly well it's me.

12:02.254 --> 12:06.486
That's superfluous information
that is tantamount to jibber-jabber.

12:06.592 --> 12:09.220
I do not tolerate
jibber-jabber in my courtroom.

12:09.328 --> 12:12.593
The defense enters a plea of not guilty.
I move for a probable cause hearing.

12:12.698 --> 12:14.757
- Why?
- Why?

12:14.867 --> 12:17.802
- First, because I'm entitled to.
Second, because I think- - He shot him.

12:17.903 --> 12:20.838
The victim is in the hospital.

12:20.940 --> 12:23.841
I think I have enough
probable cause, Mr. Shoop.

12:23.943 --> 12:26.104
Actually, Your Honor,
uh, since our last get-together...

12:26.212 --> 12:28.112
I've changed my name
from Shoop to Shore.

12:28.214 --> 12:30.682
Since it's already on
my driver's license and passport...

12:30.783 --> 12:33.047
not to mention
all the pleadings before you-

12:33.152 --> 12:35.279
Though I'd never presume you
to read pleadings. They're-

12:35.387 --> 12:37.082
- Jibber-jabber.
- Jibber-jabber.

12:37.189 --> 12:39.885
The victim is in fact scheduled
to be released from the hospital today.

12:39.992 --> 12:43.450
It was simply a shoulder wound, which is where
my client was hoping the bullet would land...

12:43.562 --> 12:47.157
once the gun accidentally went off
after the victim threatened to shoot my client...

12:47.266 --> 12:50.030
- putting him in reasonable fear for his life.
- Your Honor, ifhe wants...

12:50.136 --> 12:52.502
a probable cause hearing,
let him call the arresting officer.

12:52.605 --> 12:56.006
The arresting officer wasn't there.
It was only my client and Dr. Fields.

12:56.108 --> 12:58.099
We're talking about
attempted murder here.

12:58.210 --> 13:00.678
The damage to Mr. Crane's reputation
could be irreparable.

13:00.780 --> 13:04.443
These charges never should've been filed.
I should be allowed a probable cause hearing.

13:04.550 --> 13:06.677
You talk too much.

13:06.786 --> 13:10.552
Assuming the victim
is physically able...

13:10.656 --> 13:15.525
we will reconvene at 3.00 p. m.
tomorrow, you talker.

13:15.628 --> 13:20.156
Enough of this- this... "poopycock. "

13:20.266 --> 13:21.563
Poopycock.

13:21.667 --> 13:23.567
Poopycock.

13:32.845 --> 13:36.406
Oh, no. No, no. No, no.
No, you don't. Get out, Denny.

13:36.515 --> 13:38.745
Dr. Fields, I'm Alan Shore.

13:38.851 --> 13:43.550
You undoubtedly know by now that we've subpoenaed
you to appear at a probable cause hearing.

13:43.656 --> 13:47.820
Well, that's not a very wise ploy, Mr. Shore.
What is it you expect me to say?

13:47.927 --> 13:49.485
That you forced Denny
to shoot you-

13:49.595 --> 13:52.086
that you gave him no choice.

13:52.198 --> 13:55.395
Oh, you don't want to be calling me
to the stand, okay?

13:55.501 --> 13:57.992
Dr. Fields, Denny informed me...

13:58.103 --> 14:00.663
that your intense desire to die...

14:00.773 --> 14:03.173
played a significant part
in what happened.

14:03.275 --> 14:05.243
You know, often when people
contemplate dying...

14:05.344 --> 14:08.074
they take measure of their legacy.

14:08.180 --> 14:12.082
I'm assuming yours thus far
consists of many things.

14:12.184 --> 14:14.049
Denny assured me
honesty is one of them.

14:14.153 --> 14:18.021
I shall count on you to be honest
in that witness chair tomorrow, sir.

14:18.123 --> 14:22.890
Well, now, I wouldn't count
on anything if I were you.

14:22.995 --> 14:26.954
Sydney, I never would've shot you.
You know that.

14:44.984 --> 14:47.646
Dear God, what now?

14:47.753 --> 14:50.085
The managing partners
have convened a meeting.

14:50.189 --> 14:52.749
The topic of discussion
is deposing Denny...

14:52.858 --> 14:54.985
expelling him from the firm.

14:55.094 --> 14:57.494
What? First of all,
the financial hit would-

14:57.596 --> 14:59.461
They don't care.
They've had enough.

14:59.565 --> 15:02.557
Second of all, they need to read
their partnership agreement. Denny can-

15:02.668 --> 15:05.398
Evidently we need to read it.
There is a clause...

15:05.504 --> 15:07.438
which calls for his ouster...

15:07.539 --> 15:09.803
should he ever be convicted of a felony, which-

15:09.909 --> 15:11.809
he is certainly looking at now.

15:15.247 --> 15:17.272
What do we do now?

15:17.383 --> 15:20.546
I don't know.
They seem serious.

15:20.653 --> 15:22.712
Why shouldn't they be?

15:22.821 --> 15:24.789
He shoots people.

15:28.127 --> 15:30.391
Massachusetts has no
"stop and identify"statutes.

15:30.496 --> 15:33.021
So we could make the argument
that the arrest was unlawful...

15:33.132 --> 15:35.327
and therefore our client
had a right to resist.

15:35.434 --> 15:37.925
- That'll never fly.
- Well, it doesn't need to fly...

15:38.037 --> 15:41.495
so much as flap and flutter
its way to reasonable doubt.

15:41.607 --> 15:45.941
Profiling is wrong. We certainly
don't do it when selling off our ports.

15:47.279 --> 15:49.008
Why are you looking at me like that?

15:49.114 --> 15:50.979
Who's closing here?

15:51.083 --> 15:52.880
Sorry?

15:52.985 --> 15:56.113
With the case.
Should I close or you?

15:56.221 --> 15:58.689
Uh, I'll take the client...

15:58.791 --> 16:01.055
and you can close.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.526
Alan.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.597
May I?

16:09.001 --> 16:11.902
I'm not terribly comfortable with you
working closely with this woman.

16:13.005 --> 16:14.973
- What?
- I'm tapped into office gossip.

16:15.074 --> 16:18.202
I happen to know you kissed her
during the death penalty thingy case.

16:18.310 --> 16:21.040
You're kissing me now.
Remember?

16:21.146 --> 16:24.912
Melissa, you and I kissed once.
I barely participated.

16:25.017 --> 16:28.453
We certainly didn't agree
to any kind of exclusivity.

16:28.554 --> 16:30.818
No hickeys or pins...

16:30.923 --> 16:33.619
- or letterman jackets.
- You and I are in a relationship, Alan.

16:33.726 --> 16:37.025
The fact that you don't realize it
doesn't give you license to be unfaithful.

16:37.129 --> 16:38.858
You're mad as a hatter.

16:38.964 --> 16:40.898
When two people sleep together-

16:41.000 --> 16:43.867
- That was a night terror thing.
- I'm talking about the sex.

16:43.969 --> 16:47.370
- What sex?
- The sex you and I both know is coming.

16:48.540 --> 16:50.269
Don't fall for her, Alan.

16:51.110 --> 16:53.374
She's just a guest star.

16:57.049 --> 17:01.008
He seemed to bejust staring at
one of the houses. It seemed very odd.

17:01.120 --> 17:04.351
We, uh, asked him for identification,
and he refused to provide it.

17:04.455 --> 17:06.446
- And then what happened?
- We asked him again.

17:06.558 --> 17:10.050
He continued to refuse.
So we attempted to take him into custody.

17:10.162 --> 17:16.067
That's when he became violent. We eventually
overcame him and placed him under arrest.

17:16.167 --> 17:19.035
When you arrived at the scene,
did you ask him what he was doing?

17:19.137 --> 17:23.233
He said he found the houses on this street
quite beautiful, and he enjoyed looking at them.

17:23.342 --> 17:27.368
And is that lawful in this neighborhood,
to look at houses that you find beautiful?

17:27.479 --> 17:29.879
- Of course.
- Is it your pattern...

17:29.982 --> 17:33.440
to ask people for identification
when they're engaging in lawful behavior?

17:33.552 --> 17:36.043
- He didn't live there. So I thought-
- How did you know that?

17:36.155 --> 17:40.285
I patrol that neighborhood. I pretty much
know who lives there and who doesn't.

17:40.392 --> 17:42.792
You know everybody in this neighborhood?
Every person?

17:42.895 --> 17:46.922
- Not every person, but-
- How did you know my client didn't live there?

17:49.601 --> 17:52.331
We have the right
to ask citizens for identification.

17:52.438 --> 17:54.736
That's all I did.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.308
You know what?

17:57.409 --> 18:00.310
I checked you out.
You're an exemplary officer.

18:00.412 --> 18:03.108
You also have
a reputation for honesty.

18:03.215 --> 18:06.343
Honestly, Officer...

18:06.452 --> 18:08.920
your decision to ask my client
for identification-

18:09.021 --> 18:10.921
Was his race a factor?

18:14.560 --> 18:18.963
Officer, was it at all a factor
that he was black?

18:22.501 --> 18:24.560
Black in an all-white neighborhood.

18:26.605 --> 18:29.165
Yes, it was a factor.

18:45.424 --> 18:47.756
- Alan.
- Shirley.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.385
- How are we doing?
- If you mean with Denny...

18:50.496 --> 18:52.828
I've got a probable cause
hearing scheduled.

18:52.931 --> 18:56.230
I'm trying to make this go away,
though I can't possibly see how.

18:56.335 --> 18:59.771
You need to. Wagons are starting to circle
if he gets any kind of conviction.

18:59.872 --> 19:03.137
Shirley, surely-
Shirley, he'll be convicted of something.

19:03.242 --> 19:06.439
Well, it can't be a felony.
There's a clause in the partnership agreement.

19:06.545 --> 19:09.378
It's serious, Alan.
The partners seem inclined to expunge him.

19:09.481 --> 19:12.575
- Well, his name is on the wall.
- They'll keep the name and broom him.

19:12.684 --> 19:16.245
I see no way of dodging this
short of you having sex with the judge.

19:16.355 --> 19:20.382
I'm sorry. I now feel queasy
having even thought of that.

19:20.492 --> 19:22.858
What about the victim?
Can he be influenced?

19:22.961 --> 19:26.192
I doubt it. Even if he consented to being shot...

19:26.298 --> 19:29.392
which he seemingly did,
that still doesn't absolve Denny.

19:29.501 --> 19:32.595
- Do you have a plan?
- At the moment, no.

19:34.606 --> 19:37.234
- So stupid.
- Then why are you being so-

19:37.342 --> 19:40.834
Because I'm being stupid.
It's like frickin' high school, for God sakes.

19:40.946 --> 19:43.039
Okay. Tell me exactly what happened.

19:43.148 --> 19:46.208
I told you. I was on a date.
It was a terrific date.

19:46.318 --> 19:50.118
With another woman?
Where do you find all these women anyway?

19:50.222 --> 19:53.521
I'm a lawyer. I was a marine. Just do the math.
I'm the complete package.

19:53.625 --> 19:57.061
- Right. So-
- So I get to her front step.

19:57.162 --> 19:59.858
Clearly she would have
received my kissing her.

19:59.965 --> 20:02.433
I wanted to kiss her.
I was going to kiss her.

20:02.534 --> 20:04.593
But I didn't, because
I have this new phobia.

20:04.703 --> 20:07.866
I mean-
Right? That's what the stupid song says.

20:07.973 --> 20:12.933
What, um, exactly
are you doing when you kiss?

20:13.045 --> 20:16.947
- I do what everybody else does.
- Yeah. E-Exactly what?

20:18.417 --> 20:20.908
Lips meet. At some point,
I put my tongue in.

20:21.019 --> 20:22.953
Swish it around a little.

20:24.690 --> 20:27.420
Ah. Well, maybe you could use
some pointers or something.

20:27.526 --> 20:30.051
I happen to be
a very advanced kisser.

20:30.162 --> 20:32.824
- Maybe I can walk you through this a little.
- Don't be ridiculous.

20:32.931 --> 20:35.559
- Beats having a phobia.
- No, it doesn't.

20:35.667 --> 20:37.464
Fine.

20:43.275 --> 20:45.106
Don't even ask.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.846
Mr. Pryor, why were you
in that neighborhood?

20:52.951 --> 20:56.751
I like to dream.
One dream- I guess my American dream-

20:56.855 --> 20:59.585
is someday I would like to
live in a home like those.

20:59.691 --> 21:02.683
I enjoy the architecture,
the landscaping.

21:02.794 --> 21:06.525
You realize a police officer
has the right to ask for identification?

21:06.632 --> 21:09.829
And if I would've been doing anything suspect,
I would've given it to him.

21:09.935 --> 21:12.335
If it would've been a random thing,
I would've complied.

21:12.437 --> 21:15.463
But it wasn't. I was targeted
because I was the wrong color.

21:15.574 --> 21:19.101
But, Mr. Pryor, come on.
You physically resisted the police officers.

21:19.211 --> 21:22.180
I never assaulted them.
I just-

21:24.783 --> 21:27.843
When they pushed me to the ground
and tried to handcuff me...

21:27.953 --> 21:29.887
I simply fought back.

21:29.988 --> 21:33.947
If a police officer sees a man he believes
to be a stranger in the neighborhood...

21:34.059 --> 21:37.961
and that man is strangely staring
at houses for no apparent reason...

21:38.063 --> 21:41.123
is it your testimony that it's unreasonable
to ask that man his name?

21:41.233 --> 21:43.701
It's not reasonable to ask him
simply because he's black.

21:43.802 --> 21:46.828
If the man had been white,
staring at the houses...

21:46.938 --> 21:48.838
it would be okay to ask his name?

21:48.940 --> 21:52.501
If he would've been white,
he wouldn't have been asked. That's my point.

21:56.014 --> 21:58.574
- Plead guilty?
- They've offered probation.

21:58.684 --> 22:01.016
- You're asking me to plead guilty?
- Mr. Pryor...

22:01.119 --> 22:03.644
your testimony went well,
but let's not kid ourselves.

22:03.755 --> 22:07.247
Under the law, police can
constitutionally require identification...

22:07.359 --> 22:10.692
without probable cause,
without reasonable suspicion.

22:10.796 --> 22:13.731
- How can that be?
- Because the public wants to feel safe.

22:13.832 --> 22:17.598
And people, especially the white ones,
don't want the black ones staring at their homes.

22:17.703 --> 22:21.537
Now, we can keep fighting here,
but you must know the law does not support us.

22:21.640 --> 22:24.370
I want to fight.

22:38.490 --> 22:41.050
- How's it looking?
- Not good, Denny.

22:41.159 --> 22:44.458
- Oh.
- Aside from the case at hand...

22:44.563 --> 22:47.862
we've got your rather colorful history
of shooting people.

22:47.966 --> 22:49.433
Hmm.

22:49.534 --> 22:53.402
- There was the man in the office last year.
- He took you hostage.

22:53.505 --> 22:55.405
- Paintball incident.
- He threw a rock at me.

22:55.507 --> 22:59.204
- Your own client.
- In the knee.

22:59.311 --> 23:03.407
It simply won't be a big leap for a jury
to think you'd happily plug your therapist.

23:03.515 --> 23:05.483
I know. I know.

23:05.584 --> 23:08.314
It's, uh- It's different
this time. I...

23:08.420 --> 23:11.821
shot a human being-
a real human being.

23:11.923 --> 23:16.724
- The others weren't?
- Well, two were criminals, and the other was, uh, homeless.

23:16.828 --> 23:18.819
But Sydney is real.

23:18.930 --> 23:22.661
He pays taxes. He lives. He breathes.
He's a Republican.

23:23.835 --> 23:27.100
We'rejust so desensitized to guns.

23:27.205 --> 23:30.971
I- You know,
I don't like to admit this.

23:31.076 --> 23:35.137
I laughed when I heard that the vice president
mistook his friend for a bird.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.738
I actually laughed.

23:37.849 --> 23:39.407
You were the only one.

23:40.952 --> 23:42.920
But to see it for real.

23:46.191 --> 23:50.457
I still can't shake the image
of Sydney going down.

23:52.731 --> 23:54.665
I- I never thought I'd say this...

23:54.766 --> 23:58.827
but I can't bring myself
to so much as look at a gun.

24:00.138 --> 24:02.163
- Denny.
- The way he fell...

24:02.274 --> 24:04.469
I thought he was dead, gone.

24:04.576 --> 24:06.544
Now I'm gone.

24:08.580 --> 24:10.514
It's not over yet, Denny.

24:10.615 --> 24:13.209
Alan, so help me God...

24:13.318 --> 24:17.721
if you ever catch me looking
at a gun again-

24:44.249 --> 24:45.910
How we doing?

24:49.955 --> 24:53.152
- A list of everything you love about me.
- That's my closing.

24:53.258 --> 24:57.194
What do I say?
The police can legally require an I. D.

24:57.295 --> 24:59.195
He resisted arrest.

24:59.297 --> 25:02.027
Under the law, he's guilty.

25:02.133 --> 25:06.593
What am I supposed to do?
Ask that the jury disregard the law?

25:07.772 --> 25:09.740
You need to have faith
in them, Chelina.

25:09.841 --> 25:13.641
You need to remember these are people
of conscience, of compassion.

25:13.745 --> 25:16.509
You need to remember
they're too stupid to get off jury duty.

25:16.615 --> 25:19.243
I am not that cynical.

25:19.351 --> 25:21.182
I know you're not.

25:23.188 --> 25:25.281
Shirley Schmidt.

25:29.127 --> 25:31.925
She assigned me to a case
recently to close.

25:32.030 --> 25:37.798
She felt I had a certain capacity
to see the darkness in people's hearts.

25:39.004 --> 25:42.405
One of the reasons
I wanted you on this case...

25:42.507 --> 25:45.499
among other reasons...

25:45.610 --> 25:51.310
I think you have a capacity to tap into
what is fundamentally decent about people.

25:52.918 --> 25:58.049
I believe if you call on this jury
to do what is right...

25:58.156 --> 26:01.091
morally right, if not legally...

26:05.230 --> 26:07.198
they will follow.

26:20.879 --> 26:23.746
So, what pointers
do you have specifically?

26:23.848 --> 26:26.112
- I have another date.
- Same girl?

26:26.217 --> 26:28.651
Different.

26:28.753 --> 26:30.846
The Few, The Proud, The Brave,
lawyer package.

26:30.956 --> 26:34.187
I get dates all right,
but I need you to tell me how to kiss.

26:36.127 --> 26:38.789
Okay. Um, first of all...

26:38.897 --> 26:41.695
the stick it in
and swish it around thing.

26:41.800 --> 26:44.769
It's not supposed to be
like cleaning your toilet.

26:44.869 --> 26:48.202
- Nice.
- There needs to be a certain...

26:48.306 --> 26:50.672
gentility about it.

26:50.775 --> 26:52.709
I think you might be too aggressive.

26:52.811 --> 26:55.473
- Okay.
- Also...

26:55.580 --> 26:59.141
what part of your tongue
is making contact with hers?

26:59.250 --> 27:01.150
What do you mean?

27:01.252 --> 27:05.313
- I mean, what-what part of your tongue is
connecting with hers? - The tip. What else?

27:05.423 --> 27:06.583
- Ooh.
- What?

27:06.691 --> 27:09.626
Well, um, this part here-
That is the most sensitive.

27:09.728 --> 27:11.889
You don't taste food with the tip.

27:11.997 --> 27:15.296
And this part is the most sensual.

27:15.400 --> 27:18.369
Well, how do people connect with
that part without slobbering?

27:18.470 --> 27:22.668
They just- Okay, could I please
show you clinically?

27:22.774 --> 27:26.107
- What do you mean?
- I mean, Brad, that I am a double black diamond kisser.

27:26.211 --> 27:29.203
And I'm also incredibly busy.
So could I please just quickly show you?

27:29.314 --> 27:31.145
- I guess. If-
- Okay.

27:35.020 --> 27:37.580
Okay. Okay, relax.

27:37.689 --> 27:40.886
The tongue isn't supposed to get hard.
I think that could be your problem.

27:42.694 --> 27:44.252
Okay.

27:49.300 --> 27:51.268
Okay. Better.

27:51.369 --> 27:54.497
Um, definitely better.
But tone down the swishing.

27:54.606 --> 27:58.736
And, um, I feel like you're blocking
my tongue from going into your mouth.

27:58.843 --> 28:00.902
- Yeah, I don't like that.
- What?

28:01.012 --> 28:05.813
- I don't like it when a woman's tongue goes in my mouth.
- Um, Brad, that's the whole idea.

28:05.917 --> 28:09.944
- Yours and hers, and hers- - I just prefer
that everything takes place in her mouth.

28:10.055 --> 28:11.955
- Why?
- Because I do.

28:12.057 --> 28:16.517
Brad, this is why you are the worst kisser
in the history of the planet.

28:16.628 --> 28:20.029
- So drop the Homeland Security, and let the girl's tongue in.
- All right.

28:20.131 --> 28:22.725
Relax. Code yellow.

28:31.910 --> 28:37.075
- Wow.
- Wow, definitely. No questions asked. Wow.

28:37.182 --> 28:38.911
Let's try it again.

28:39.017 --> 28:41.042
Mmm.

28:43.655 --> 28:45.885
Mmm. Mmm.

28:45.990 --> 28:48.185
Um-

28:48.293 --> 28:51.319
You're a-
You're a really quick study.

28:51.429 --> 28:53.294
Wow.

28:54.899 --> 28:57.959
- Uh, let's put it together. You and me. Me and you.
- I, um-

28:58.069 --> 28:59.730
I don't think that-

29:01.239 --> 29:03.207
Mmm!

29:03.308 --> 29:06.300
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This lesson does not include hands.

29:23.595 --> 29:25.995
Do you swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth...

29:26.097 --> 29:28.588
- and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
- Yes, I do.

29:30.368 --> 29:33.303
Good afternoon, Dr. Fields.
Thank you forjoining us.

29:33.404 --> 29:35.668
I realize you've been
through quite an ordeal.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.834
Yes. And now you seek
to put me through another.

29:38.943 --> 29:40.604
Your Honor, Dr. Fields is hostile.

29:40.712 --> 29:42.475
Why wouldn't he be?
He was shot.

29:42.580 --> 29:46.311
No. I mean as in hostile witness.
Uh, permit me to lead.

29:46.417 --> 29:50.148
- Oh, go on then.
- Dr. Fields, at the time of the incident...

29:50.255 --> 29:54.021
Mr. Crane was in the middle
of a therapy session with you.

29:54.125 --> 29:56.491
- Am I correct?
- Denny Crane doesn't even believe in therapy.

29:56.594 --> 29:59.620
He comes out of boredom.
He likes to hear himself talk.

29:59.731 --> 30:02.529
- Which is the cause of great frustration for you.
- Yes.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.625
'Cause when he's not
endlessly repeating his name...

30:04.736 --> 30:06.897
he's full of this
self-serving blather.

30:07.005 --> 30:11.669
If I have to hear him go on
one more time about mad cow-

30:11.776 --> 30:13.801
This time he was less boring.
He pulled a gun.

30:13.912 --> 30:18.076
Yes. Well, the gun. The gun. If I had a nickel
for every time he did that-

30:18.183 --> 30:22.347
- Wait. He's drawn a gun on you before?
- Oh. Oh! Hell, yes.

30:22.453 --> 30:25.980
Any time he doesn't like what he hears, yes,
it's Dirty Harry time.

30:26.090 --> 30:29.890
So you really didn't feel threatened
when he produced a firearm this time then?

30:29.994 --> 30:32.224
I felt threatened to the extent...

30:32.330 --> 30:35.265
that this time it might just go off,
the way he waves it around.

30:35.366 --> 30:38.733
Okay. But, Doctor, you produced a gun
of your own, didn't you?

30:38.837 --> 30:40.930
- Absolutely I did, yes.
- Why?

30:41.039 --> 30:42.700
Because I just did.
That's why.

30:42.807 --> 30:46.208
Okay? I was sick ofhis antics,
and I told him so.

30:46.311 --> 30:48.871
You called him an empty sack,
told him he led a meaningless life.

30:48.980 --> 30:51.676
You provoked him
to pull his gun, didn't you?

30:51.783 --> 30:53.546
Maybe so. I don't know.
Who cares?

30:53.651 --> 30:57.052
What is this poopycock?
What kind of doctor are you?

30:57.155 --> 30:58.884
Your Honor, if I may proceed?

30:58.990 --> 31:01.254
Oh, go on then.

31:01.359 --> 31:06.422
Dr. Fields, once Mr. Crane
produced his weapon, you drew yours.

31:06.531 --> 31:09.466
And you told him if he didn't shoot you,
you'd shoot him.

31:09.567 --> 31:13.731
- Did you not say that, sir?
- Obviously. You know that I did.

31:13.838 --> 31:16.568
You wanted him to shoot you
so you wouldn't have to shoot yourself...

31:16.674 --> 31:20.872
and your family could collect the life insurance
to pay for your son's Ivy League education.

31:20.979 --> 31:22.913
Well, it certainly
sounds like you were there.

31:23.014 --> 31:24.777
You gave him to the count of three.

31:24.883 --> 31:27.078
Shoot you by the count of three
or you'd kill him.

31:27.185 --> 31:29.312
- That's right. Mm-hmm.
- And you counted it off.

31:29.420 --> 31:31.718
- One, two-
- And three.

31:31.823 --> 31:34.291
- Don't anybody leave this room.
- What is this jibber-jabber?

31:34.392 --> 31:36.952
- Shut up! - That wouldn't be
jibber-jabber, Your Honor. That's a gun.

31:37.061 --> 31:39.996
Anybody leaves this room,
and I will shoot Mr. Shore.

31:40.098 --> 31:43.295
- If I might object to that.
- How did you get in with that?

31:43.401 --> 31:46.996
My brother is a lawyer, and I came in
the back door with his bar card.

31:47.105 --> 31:49.972
- I guess the question, Dr. Fields, is why?
- Why?

31:50.074 --> 31:54.272
Because all my life
I sat in that chair.

31:54.379 --> 31:56.176
That's why.

31:56.281 --> 31:59.512
Listening to other people who had lives
far more grander than mine...

31:59.617 --> 32:03.917
while I just sat tucked away
in my office leading no life at all.

32:04.022 --> 32:07.685
Vicariously coaching other people,
watching them get rich like this-

32:07.792 --> 32:09.623
this nutcase here!

32:09.727 --> 32:12.491
And I couldn't stand it anymore!

32:12.597 --> 32:14.861
I did crack!
I wasn't gonna just stand around...

32:14.966 --> 32:20.097
being some- some sort of impotent
little spectator to my own life!

32:20.204 --> 32:23.264
And I'm sick of any society
that- that...

32:23.374 --> 32:27.037
glamorizes the eccentrics
and the psychopaths...

32:27.145 --> 32:30.672
and the belligerents when there's
the meek and the wise-

32:30.782 --> 32:34.684
- If I could get you to point that in any other dir-
- Shut up!

32:34.786 --> 32:38.779
You think you're the only one who likes to
live big, Denny? You think that?

32:38.890 --> 32:42.451
You think that by paying me $600 an hour
that that entitles you to belittle me?

32:42.560 --> 32:45.051
- 600?
- Shut up!

32:45.163 --> 32:47.324
You stand belittled now, Denny.

32:47.432 --> 32:50.731
Why don't I shoot your best friend here?
Why not? I mean, he's your real therapist.

32:50.835 --> 32:53.895
He's the one you tell your secrets to!
Why don't I just shoot him?

32:54.005 --> 32:58.669
- Please put the gun down.
- I didn't shoot before, Denny, but I will this time.

32:58.776 --> 33:01.074
- I really will.
- Sydney.

33:01.179 --> 33:03.841
- I took you out once. Don't make me do it again.
- With what?

33:03.948 --> 33:05.848
This!

33:13.291 --> 33:16.351
You said you'd never so much
as look at a gun again.

33:16.461 --> 33:18.429
I never said I wouldn't shoot one.

33:32.143 --> 33:36.409
I feel I should go with him.
I'm as close as he actually has to family.

33:36.514 --> 33:40.177
- Denny, you shot him twice.
- Even so. Should we ask for a continuance?

33:40.284 --> 33:42.684
No. I want to make my argument
to dismiss to the judge...

33:42.787 --> 33:44.721
while he's still
in the throes of fear.

33:44.822 --> 33:47.518
I'm due in Division Three
for closing arguments in the Pryor case.

33:47.625 --> 33:50.526
- Hopefully I'll be back within the hour.
- I'll take over from here.

33:50.628 --> 33:53.062
Don't you dare.

33:53.164 --> 33:55.428
- And don't shoot anybody.
- Oh, please.

33:59.337 --> 34:01.965
- Did they arrest Denny again?
- Apparently not.

34:02.073 --> 34:05.008
- It appears he saved everyone.
- What about the underlying charges?

34:05.109 --> 34:07.577
As far as I know, they still stand.

34:11.282 --> 34:15.116
- Um, we need to talk.
- We most certainly do.

34:15.219 --> 34:17.414
It was a kissing demonstration.

34:19.590 --> 34:23.047
- We had sex.
- I'm aware of that.

34:25.362 --> 34:27.956
- On the floor.
- I am aware of that too.

34:28.065 --> 34:30.000
Which brings me to, what now?

34:30.101 --> 34:33.264
Company inkwell, Brad.
We work together. That's it.

34:33.371 --> 34:35.737
- We had sex.
- Yes.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.933
- Incredible sex.
- Yes.

34:38.042 --> 34:40.476
And that's it?

34:40.578 --> 34:43.274
Yes.

34:54.958 --> 34:58.793
Mr. Pryor refused to identification
in defiance of the law.

34:58.896 --> 35:02.696
He then physically resisted arrest,
which is a second crime.

35:02.800 --> 35:07.066
And he wasn't targeted simply because
he was black, by the way.

35:07.171 --> 35:10.937
He was questioned because he was
a stranger to a particular neighborhood.

35:11.042 --> 35:15.274
Now, did Officer Ralston come to that conclusion
in part because he was African-American?

35:15.379 --> 35:18.007
Yes. He admitted that.

35:18.116 --> 35:21.108
But where's the line between
racial profiling and common sense?

35:21.219 --> 35:23.244
Race can be used as a criterion...

35:23.354 --> 35:26.551
as long as it's just one factor among others
in estimating criminal suspicion.

35:26.657 --> 35:30.184
Common sense.
When it comes to terrorism, for example...

35:30.294 --> 35:32.854
of course we target people
of Islamic or Arab descent.

35:32.964 --> 35:36.229
We simply have to afford the police
the discretion to say, "Hey.

35:36.334 --> 35:40.464
That person might be more likely to be
engaging in certain criminal activity. "

35:40.571 --> 35:44.007
Now here the defendant
was a stranger to this neighborhood.

35:44.108 --> 35:46.008
He was oddly staring at houses.

35:46.110 --> 35:50.547
Officer Ralston asked his name.
The defendant refused to tell him...

35:50.648 --> 35:53.014
which in addition to being a crime,
made him more suspicious.

35:53.117 --> 35:58.054
Then he got violent. We're here
not because of Mr. Pryor's race...

35:59.790 --> 36:02.384
but because he broke the law.

36:02.493 --> 36:07.556
I guess we don't have much
of a problem targeting Islamics.

36:07.665 --> 36:11.362
Especially not at the airport.

36:11.469 --> 36:15.530
That doesn't offend us
because we all so want to feel safe.

36:15.640 --> 36:20.577
But the thing is it's taken the stigma
off of racial profiling.

36:20.678 --> 36:23.112
The term no longer
has a bad connotation.

36:23.214 --> 36:27.651
And thatjust makes it easier
to profile other races, doesn't it?

36:27.752 --> 36:31.984
I mean, once you say
it isn't an evil to discriminate...

36:32.089 --> 36:35.058
you make it slightly more
permissible to discriminate.

36:35.159 --> 36:37.923
Next thing you know, you got police
questioning African-Americans...

36:38.029 --> 36:40.520
simply for looking at houses
in white neighborhoods.

36:40.631 --> 36:44.795
We have a term in
this country called D. W. B.

36:44.902 --> 36:46.870
"Driving While Black. "

36:46.971 --> 36:50.737
Innocent black motorists
are pulled over every day in this country.

36:50.841 --> 36:52.741
It's a way of life.

36:52.843 --> 36:54.811
Well, guess what.

36:54.912 --> 36:57.380
People like Dennis Pryor
have a choice.

36:57.481 --> 36:59.711
They can either
rail against it...

36:59.817 --> 37:03.514
or they can just concede
it's a way oflife...

37:03.621 --> 37:05.589
and things stay the same.

37:05.690 --> 37:09.956
Dennis Pryor decided to protest.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.723
He decided to hear the words
of Henry Thoreau...

37:12.830 --> 37:15.993
Susan B. Anthony,
Martin Luther King Jr...

37:16.100 --> 37:20.628
who all considered
civil disobedience to be patriotic.

37:20.738 --> 37:22.638
American.

37:23.874 --> 37:25.842
You need to go back to that room...

37:25.943 --> 37:29.379
and hear the dream of Dr. King...

37:29.480 --> 37:33.416
where children grow up to be judged
not by the color of their skin.

37:33.517 --> 37:37.476
My client was judged
by the color of his skin.

37:37.588 --> 37:41.957
That cannot be acceptable to a country
that prides itself on human rights.

37:42.059 --> 37:46.291
That cannot be acceptable
to the 12 of you.

37:54.472 --> 37:57.236
I don't dispute that
Mr. Crane's life was in danger...

37:57.341 --> 38:01.277
but he created the dangerous situation
when he first pulled the gun on Dr. Fields.

38:01.379 --> 38:03.472
Oh, please.
Did I create it in this courtroom?

38:03.581 --> 38:06.141
To an extent, yes.
We wouldn't have all been standing here...

38:06.250 --> 38:08.514
had you not pulled that gun
back in the doctor's office.

38:08.619 --> 38:10.985
Your Honor,
I saved this man's life, probably yours...

38:11.088 --> 38:15.787
and he's in here waving around his poopycock
with his mumbo jumbo jibber-jabber-

38:15.893 --> 38:19.226
At a minimum, the charges of carrying
a concealed weapon should be considered.

38:19.330 --> 38:22.493
National security.
Dr. Fields is a terrorist.

38:22.600 --> 38:25.797
He terrorized this courtroom.
He's a Democrat.

38:25.903 --> 38:28.565
I've had enough of all this.
Mr. Crane...

38:28.673 --> 38:31.699
you had no excuse
to be carrying a gun.

38:31.809 --> 38:33.868
Second Amendment. Founding fathers.
You probably knew them.

38:33.978 --> 38:36.310
Jibber-jabber.

38:36.414 --> 38:41.147
But here you did use the gun
to save lives, quite possibly my own.

38:41.252 --> 38:44.415
I'm going to
let you off this time...

38:44.522 --> 38:46.046
with just a stern warning.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.215
Thank you.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.850
I haven't given it yet!

38:49.960 --> 38:52.087
Mr. Crane...

38:53.130 --> 38:56.930
I warn you not to do...

38:58.369 --> 39:00.337
this again.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.330
Not guilty. Adjourned.

39:04.809 --> 39:08.074
- Well, seems you didn't need me after all.
- Ennyday Anecray.

39:15.453 --> 39:18.854
Mr. Foreman, has thejury
reached a unanimous verdict?

39:18.956 --> 39:21.686
- We have, Your Honor.
- What say you?

39:21.792 --> 39:24.056
In the matter of
the Commonwealth versus Dennis Pryor...

39:24.161 --> 39:26.061
on the charge
of disorderly conduct...

39:26.163 --> 39:28.290
we find the defendant not guilty.

39:28.399 --> 39:31.527
On the charge of unlawfully
resisting arrest...

39:31.635 --> 39:33.796
we find the defendant not guilty.

39:33.904 --> 39:35.428
Ladies and gentlemen
of thejury-

39:35.539 --> 39:38.064
- I won?
- You won.

39:38.175 --> 39:42.043
- No probation or anything?
- You won, Dennis. You are free to go.

39:42.146 --> 39:44.774
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

39:44.882 --> 39:48.477
- And thank you.
- I hope you get to live in that beautiful house one day.

39:48.586 --> 39:50.486
Pick a better neighborhood.

39:50.588 --> 39:53.386
I will. Thank you.
I will.

40:00.197 --> 40:02.165
Bye.

40:10.541 --> 40:12.509
Bye.

40:28.292 --> 40:30.351
Ah, still at large.

40:31.829 --> 40:34.297
And don't think
I take it for granted.

40:36.367 --> 40:38.301
Canada, Japan, England-

40:38.402 --> 40:42.202
Any number of those pinko countries,
I'd be in jail for shooting somebody.

40:42.306 --> 40:45.503
- God bless America.
- I had sex with her.

40:47.378 --> 40:49.346
With whom?

40:49.447 --> 40:52.041
Kate Smith, before
she put on the weight.

40:52.149 --> 40:56.347
From the mountains to her prairies,
she is one hell of a ride.

40:58.656 --> 41:00.590
So, Denny, what happened?

41:00.691 --> 41:02.625
Your love affair with guns back on?

41:02.726 --> 41:06.457
Alan, lives were saved
because I was armed.

41:06.564 --> 41:10.330
We all should be armed. Every citizen
should have one strapped to his waist.

41:10.434 --> 41:12.527
Hell, the criminals all have them.

41:12.636 --> 41:16.197
The answer isn't less guns.
It's more.

41:16.307 --> 41:19.242
I'm surprised you didn't
think of it sooner.

41:19.343 --> 41:21.243
Mad cow.

41:21.345 --> 41:24.746
So...

41:24.849 --> 41:27.044
how was it with Ch-Chelina?

41:27.151 --> 41:29.711
Incredible pheromones.

41:29.820 --> 41:33.187
- Mmm.
- Had I been a moth, we'd have mated and died by now.

41:33.290 --> 41:36.487
Oh. And then, of course,
there's Melissa.

41:36.594 --> 41:38.721
I don't know what to make of her.

41:38.829 --> 41:41.127
It's good to have choices.

41:42.500 --> 41:46.334
Thought it was funny
to finally meet your therapist.

41:47.705 --> 41:50.037
A man never introduces
his wife to his mistress.

41:50.140 --> 41:52.108
That's a shame.

41:52.209 --> 41:54.871
Makes for a hell of a party.

41:56.981 --> 41:59.973
So, do you think it's
a sign of Alzheimer's...

42:00.084 --> 42:02.450
if you can't remember
how many people you shot?

42:02.553 --> 42:05.579
As long as you can remember who.

42:05.689 --> 42:07.680
Hmm. Hmm.

42:07.791 --> 42:09.759
Hmm.

42:49.233 --> 42:51.633
You stinker!

42:52.305 --> 42:58.719
