WEBVTT

00:02.017 --> 00:04.285
Have you never had to play
by anybody else's rules?

00:04.353 --> 00:05.586
So you're just a spoiled brat.

00:05.688 --> 00:07.455
Women don't usually
talk to me like that.

00:07.557 --> 00:10.257
Oh, because you're so devastatingly
attractive.

00:10.359 --> 00:12.026
- And the accent, yeah.
- Oh.

00:12.128 --> 00:13.294
So this is a setup,

00:13.396 --> 00:14.636
and I'm the old, desperate one?

00:14.697 --> 00:16.664
Something's wrong. It's Mary.

00:16.766 --> 00:18.265
- Come with me.
- Mary!

00:18.367 --> 00:20.401
- We killed somebody, didn't we?
- Yeah.

00:20.503 --> 00:23.003
And there is John Booth.

00:23.106 --> 00:24.205
The guy that just bought our network?

00:24.307 --> 00:25.573
Everyone here knows

00:25.675 --> 00:27.475
that you're the true creator
of "Everlasting".

00:27.577 --> 00:29.243
So you're the one who's
calling me "Hot Rachel."

00:29.345 --> 00:30.478
Well, you do kind of look like her.

00:30.580 --> 00:32.012
You're a selfish bitch.

00:37.053 --> 00:38.419
You're fired.

00:38.521 --> 00:40.387
So far, you've run me into an epidural,

00:40.490 --> 00:42.623
firing my cousin, and some girl's daddy.

00:42.725 --> 00:45.426
Hey, this is my job,
and I do it every stupid day

00:45.528 --> 00:46.694
of my stupid life.

00:46.796 --> 00:48.229
Calm down, all right? Are you okay?

00:48.331 --> 00:50.297
- I don't know!
- Are you taking your meds?

00:50.399 --> 00:51.966
What am I prescribed for right now...

00:52.068 --> 00:54.268
borderline or narcissistic
personality disorder?

00:54.370 --> 00:57.037
Because I'm like
constantly getting them confused.

00:57.140 --> 00:58.639
You know, I think Rachel's
in love with that guy.

00:58.741 --> 01:00.241
I've never seen her like this before.

01:00.343 --> 01:01.609
I have.

01:01.711 --> 01:04.278
That boy's like a
cancer. We need to cut him out.

01:04.379 --> 01:06.413
- Hello, gorgeous.
- Gwen?

01:06.516 --> 01:08.182
What are you doing right now?

01:08.284 --> 01:09.760
Here we go again.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:18.327 --> 01:21.896
So, there's this thing.

01:21.998 --> 01:23.964
My cousin's getting married on
Martha's Vineyard next month.

01:24.066 --> 01:25.099
Your cousin's getting married?

01:25.201 --> 01:27.568
She is, but I was wondering...

01:27.670 --> 01:29.069
Mmm!

01:29.172 --> 01:31.172
If you'll be my date to the wedding.

01:33.376 --> 01:34.475
Yes.

01:34.577 --> 01:37.678
It's gonna be a total nightmare, but...

01:37.780 --> 01:39.313
- after the wedding...
- Yeah.

01:39.415 --> 01:40.655
We can go spend a couple days

01:40.716 --> 01:42.149
at my family's house in Chilmark.

01:42.251 --> 01:44.518
So, do we have a deal?

01:44.620 --> 01:46.387
- Do you want me to beg you or what?
- Yes!

01:46.489 --> 01:48.989
Yes. No, not yes to the beg.

01:49.091 --> 01:51.425
Just, yes, I'd love to go.

01:51.527 --> 01:53.260
Yes.

01:55.531 --> 01:57.097
Um, Rachel?

01:57.200 --> 01:59.066
Madison, go away!

01:59.168 --> 02:02.303
Uh, I really, really
think you should come out here.

02:02.405 --> 02:04.271
- Yes, Madison?
- I'm sorry.

02:04.373 --> 02:06.373
There's someone here
that you're gonna want to see.

02:06.442 --> 02:08.241
- Who?
- Um...

02:10.346 --> 02:11.912
Hi, Rachel.

02:15.612 --> 02:19.200
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

02:21.757 --> 02:24.358
What are you doing? Get out of here.

02:30.399 --> 02:34.468
Okay, so, um, what part about
me not returning your calls

02:34.570 --> 02:36.250
made you think I
wanted you to show up here

02:36.305 --> 02:37.238
in the middle of the night?

02:37.340 --> 02:39.206
- Quinn called me.
- She did?

02:39.308 --> 02:41.008
Yeah, I'm here to do the show.

02:41.110 --> 02:43.590
Some kind of ex-suitor
returns, seeks redemption kind of thing?

02:43.613 --> 02:45.388
You want redemption from "Everlasting"?

02:45.413 --> 02:46.004
No, I don't.

02:46.082 --> 02:47.648
But I'm willing to
put up with "Everlasting"

02:47.750 --> 02:49.149
because I wanted to see you.

02:50.753 --> 02:52.353
Okay, dude, you've seen me. Like, go.

02:52.455 --> 02:53.654
Rachel, I'm sorry.

02:53.756 --> 02:55.089
I messed up.

02:55.191 --> 02:57.291
I can't believe how badly I messed up.

02:57.393 --> 02:58.753
I shouldn't have listened to Quinn

02:58.794 --> 03:00.594
and I shouldn't have run
away and I know that.

03:00.630 --> 03:02.296
I've changed.

03:02.398 --> 03:04.999
These past few months, I've been
in Africa doing charity work.

03:05.101 --> 03:07.434
You were in Africa, like my Africa?

03:07.536 --> 03:09.496
Like, I went there and I
traveled through villages

03:09.505 --> 03:11.905
helping them gain access to
clean water, and it was amazing.

03:12.008 --> 03:13.407
What are you talking about?

03:13.509 --> 03:15.342
I was... I wanted you there
with me, and I tried calling.

03:15.444 --> 03:17.144
I did not call you back.
Don't you get it?

03:17.246 --> 03:19.280
Is this about
whoever's in that room with you?

03:19.382 --> 03:20.481
Because you and I both know

03:20.583 --> 03:22.182
whoever he is, he doesn't matter.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.285
You have no idea what
you're talking about, okay?

03:24.387 --> 03:26.186
All right.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.455
I'll be back in the morning,

03:28.557 --> 03:30.357
but my flight's not till Thursday.

03:30.459 --> 03:32.359
I'm not going anywhere.

03:35.231 --> 03:36.964
Oh, my God.

03:37.066 --> 03:38.332
So, what's his deal?

03:38.434 --> 03:40.234
If Quinn called him,
why is his first stop

03:40.336 --> 03:43.570
your office in the middle of the night?

03:43.673 --> 03:46.073
That's a really good question.

03:46.175 --> 03:47.791
Um, it's because we have this,

03:47.816 --> 03:49.701
- like, whole crazy thing.
- A thing?

03:49.812 --> 03:52.313
It was like this
Stockholm syndrome thing, you know,

03:52.415 --> 03:55.282
where they're like...
you're, like, basically producing them,

03:55.384 --> 03:57.418
and then they, like,
fall in love with you.

03:57.520 --> 04:00.020
I just try to forget
that it ever happened,

04:00.022 --> 04:02.056
which... really...

04:02.158 --> 04:04.558
- Wow.
- Yeah.

04:07.730 --> 04:09.963
So let's get rid of him.

04:10.066 --> 04:11.398
He's out of here.

04:11.500 --> 04:13.067
Quinn doesn't get to make
executive decisions.

04:13.169 --> 04:14.234
She's not the showrunner anymore.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.903
- Yeah.
- This is our show.

04:16.005 --> 04:18.137
Exactly. Talk about our show more.

04:18.240 --> 04:20.940
It turns me on.

04:21.043 --> 04:24.478
All right, listen.

04:24.580 --> 04:25.979
Be honest, okay?

04:26.082 --> 04:29.450
Was that date better
or worse than the funeral?

04:29.552 --> 04:31.318
Well, the funeral had better music,

04:31.420 --> 04:33.220
but this time, I got to third base.

04:33.322 --> 04:36.090
Okay, I think you got
a lot further than that.

04:36.192 --> 04:38.392
I realy don't understand
American sports.

04:38.494 --> 04:40.160
Oh, no.

04:40.262 --> 04:42.096
Okay.

04:42.198 --> 04:44.298
Okay, we have to stop.

04:44.400 --> 04:46.500
Remember, I told you I have
a big day today, okay?

04:46.602 --> 04:48.135
We're gonna go do a little surprise

04:48.237 --> 04:51.238
- for our showrunner wannabe.
- Hmm. Coleman.

04:51.340 --> 04:53.674
You know, I thought he
was very impressive when

04:53.743 --> 04:55.642
he and Rachel pitched me
at the Impact Awards.

04:55.745 --> 04:57.344
- Oh. Hmm.
- Hmm.

04:57.446 --> 05:00.948
You know, he is impressive.

05:01.050 --> 05:02.950
He's a real go-getter.

05:03.052 --> 05:08.122
In fact, I think that
you should definitely,

05:08.224 --> 05:10.357
definitely do something with him.

05:10.459 --> 05:12.893
I mean, you know,
he's... he's just killing time

05:12.995 --> 05:15.129
while he's here at "Everlasting,"

05:15.231 --> 05:17.865
and he's actually right inside.

05:17.967 --> 05:21.201
You could go talk to him
right now face to face.

05:21.303 --> 05:23.237
- Now? Really, now?
- Yes.

05:23.339 --> 05:25.572
Well, no better time than the present,

05:25.674 --> 05:29.877
but you cannot poach
Rachel, 'cause I have been working

05:29.979 --> 05:33.147
very hard on her for three
years, and I don't want

05:33.249 --> 05:35.315
that to go to waste, okay?

05:35.418 --> 05:37.184
- So hands off.
- Understood.

05:37.286 --> 05:39.119
Understood. Yes.

05:39.221 --> 05:41.121
Understood.

05:41.223 --> 05:43.023
Um, and then we'll bring Darius
in when all that's done,

05:43.125 --> 05:46.160
- and he's not gonna any.
- Okay, dude. Got it.

05:46.262 --> 05:48.662
Damn. Walk of shame much?

05:48.764 --> 05:50.431
Where were you?

05:50.533 --> 05:51.665
It's none of your business.

05:51.767 --> 05:53.667
So you brought Adam here, huh?

05:53.769 --> 05:55.235
Yeah.

05:55.337 --> 05:57.004
You're welcome.

05:57.106 --> 05:59.339
I mean, you should be
kissing my ass for this.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.875
You can't make decisions like
that without my say-so.

06:01.977 --> 06:04.211
Oh, you mean as opposed to the
stellar decisions you've made?

06:04.313 --> 06:05.612
I'm sorry, what?

06:05.714 --> 06:08.015
You know, you want to know
why I brought Adam here?

06:08.117 --> 06:10.184
Because his social-media
buzz is off the charts.

06:10.252 --> 06:11.532
Oh, I don't even care, actually.

06:11.620 --> 06:13.320
He was a ratings dynamo last year.

06:13.422 --> 06:16.056
No, he was the pussy who got
left at the altar last year.

06:16.158 --> 06:18.459
He's a catch who had the misfortune

06:18.561 --> 06:20.561
of falling for a heartless bitch.

06:20.629 --> 06:22.329
I mean, every woman in America wants

06:22.431 --> 06:23.997
to screw the sadness out of him.

06:24.099 --> 06:26.166
Every woman in my office, certainly.

06:26.268 --> 06:27.968
The guy's a knicker-dropper.

06:28.070 --> 06:30.304
Yeah, hey.  Hey.

06:30.406 --> 06:31.638
It's nice to see you again.

06:31.740 --> 06:34.274
I, uh, didn't realize you two were...

06:34.376 --> 06:35.943
I'm sorry.

06:36.045 --> 06:38.111
Are you saying something?

06:38.214 --> 06:40.297
Hey, uh, so we're
gonna run with Adam today,

06:40.356 --> 06:41.649
but in the future,
though, let's make sure

06:41.650 --> 06:42.550
we're definitely all on the same page.

06:42.651 --> 06:44.451
We are all on the same page now.

06:44.553 --> 06:46.887
I mean, unless there's
a specific reason,

06:46.989 --> 06:48.989
Rachel, why you can't work with Adam?

06:49.091 --> 06:51.558
No, I'm good.

06:51.660 --> 06:55.028
All right, this is gonna be a fun day.

06:55.130 --> 06:57.464
I'll go, uh, prep the ladies.

06:57.566 --> 06:59.132
I will see you later.

06:59.235 --> 07:01.235
Let's go, you little dummmy.

07:03.405 --> 07:05.472
Uh, Coleman, can I have a word, please?

07:05.574 --> 07:07.474
I'd love to hear more from you

07:07.576 --> 07:10.310
off of our
conversation at the Impact Awards.

07:10.412 --> 07:12.112
Okay, yeah, glad to hear that.

07:12.214 --> 07:14.515
Actually, Rach and I have been
working up some really...

07:14.617 --> 07:17.351
You're the one that
I've really got my eye on.

07:17.453 --> 07:20.387
So, uh, if it's okay, you and I

07:20.489 --> 07:22.122
will have a little chat
a bit later, hmm?

07:22.224 --> 07:24.324
- Just...
- Yeah, just the two of us.

07:24.426 --> 07:26.894
- Good?
- Right, okay.

07:26.996 --> 07:28.462
- Excellent.
- Yeah.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.432
Here's the deal, all right?

07:32.535 --> 07:35.068
We are at week seven, and the
natives are getting restless.

07:35.170 --> 07:37.304
Darius is pissed at us and the world

07:37.406 --> 07:39.239
after his trip to Alabama,
and I need you

07:39.341 --> 07:41.141
to re-energize the girls, all right?

07:41.243 --> 07:43.010
Just give them that whole, "Who, me?

07:43.112 --> 07:45.192
I never banged a hooker,"
face. Break out the accent.

07:45.247 --> 07:47.881
Why did you really bring me back here?

07:47.983 --> 07:49.349
There it is.

07:49.451 --> 07:52.319
I'm giving you the opportunity
of a second chance.

07:52.421 --> 07:55.022
You regret how you left things,

07:55.124 --> 07:57.024
so why don't you make them better.

07:57.126 --> 07:58.625
With America?

07:58.727 --> 08:01.161
With whomever.

08:01.263 --> 08:04.231
Trunks! I need swim trunks.

08:04.333 --> 08:05.966
Oh, thank you very much.

08:06.068 --> 08:08.402
Now, you are going to get
into this little ball squeezer.

08:08.504 --> 08:10.571
- No, no, not happening.
- Yes, gonna happen, okay?

08:10.673 --> 08:12.105
You're gonna jump in the hot tub

08:12.207 --> 08:13.527
with some angry girls in bikinis.

08:13.576 --> 08:14.875
Okay? Thank you very much.

08:14.977 --> 08:17.477
Hey, faster. Can you please walk faster?

08:17.580 --> 08:20.047
Welcome back, meat puppet.

08:25.955 --> 08:28.288
Oh, not again.

08:28.390 --> 08:31.058
- Ooh!
- Damn, that ass is bite-able.

08:31.160 --> 08:32.893
Whoa!

08:32.995 --> 08:34.294
Hey!

08:34.395 --> 08:36.330
Booty.

08:36.432 --> 08:39.866
That is a nice package. I'm sorry.

08:39.969 --> 08:41.489
- Word.
- Can you fit that in one hand,

08:41.503 --> 08:42.970
or do you need two hands?

08:43.072 --> 08:46.039
I'm just curious.

08:46.141 --> 08:47.407
That's fantastic.

08:47.509 --> 08:49.276
Look at those abs.

08:49.378 --> 08:51.278
- Fine British sausage.
- Hubba, hubba.

08:51.380 --> 08:53.213
Okay, yeah. No, you can throw around
all the insults you want.

08:53.315 --> 08:55.215
It is like this all day.
Maybe we should all just calm down.

08:55.317 --> 08:57.484
Because Darius doesn't care,
okay? I don't know what you've done.

08:57.586 --> 08:59.586
- Wake up.
- Okay, guys, guys.

08:59.688 --> 09:00.566
He's gonna make a decision 'cause

09:00.591 --> 09:01.545
- he wants me, okay?
- Guys, guys, guys.

09:01.624 --> 09:04.958
I know it's hard, but I have
been in Darius' shoes,

09:05.060 --> 09:07.094
and he's probably having strong feelings

09:07.196 --> 09:10.263
that he's just not sure how to express.

09:10.366 --> 09:14.167
Sometimes a woman really challenges you,

09:14.269 --> 09:17.170
and it makes you want to run away,

09:17.272 --> 09:19.072
because it's terrifying.

09:19.174 --> 09:22.409
Good Lord, Jameson,
he's not talking about you.

09:22.511 --> 09:26.046
And the worst part is I did meet

09:26.148 --> 09:27.914
An incredible woman here,

09:28.017 --> 09:30.017
and I wanted to spend
the rest of my life with her,

09:30.019 --> 09:31.885
but I ruined it.

09:31.987 --> 09:34.921
And I've regretted it every day since.

09:34.990 --> 09:38.458
I just wish I'd tuned
everything else out and followed my heart.

09:38.560 --> 09:40.193
Ohh!

09:40.295 --> 09:44.364
And the panties of America
drip in unison.

09:44.466 --> 09:48.068
Oh, Rachel, you should screw
the talent more often.

09:48.170 --> 09:49.970
- Give it a rest, Quinn.
- This is ridiculous.

09:50.072 --> 09:52.372
Okay, people, how about we get

09:52.474 --> 09:55.609
my current pain-in-the-ass
suitor Darius

09:55.711 --> 09:57.978
to give a fraction of a crap?

10:01.383 --> 10:02.549
Okay, cut, everyone.

10:02.651 --> 10:05.018
That's a wrap. Got it.

10:05.120 --> 10:08.221
I have to tell you, I
watched every minute of your season.

10:08.323 --> 10:11.191
It was... thank you. It was so intense.

10:11.293 --> 10:12.426
Yeah, yeah.

10:12.528 --> 10:14.027
You have to tell me everything.

10:14.129 --> 10:15.962
I even heard a rumor
about you and Rachel.

10:16.065 --> 10:18.231
Why are you so interested?

10:18.333 --> 10:20.233
I'm just a curious girl.

10:20.335 --> 10:21.568
Right.

10:21.670 --> 10:24.471
I think they have
drinks for you just over there.

10:24.573 --> 10:26.239
Okay.

10:26.341 --> 10:27.974
Um...

10:28.043 --> 10:29.476
Hey. That was great.

10:29.578 --> 10:31.078
- You looked fantastic.
- Oh.

10:31.180 --> 10:32.379
I'm Coleman.

10:32.481 --> 10:34.014
I'm the new showrunner.

10:34.116 --> 10:36.383
- Showrunner, right.
- Welcome.

10:36.485 --> 10:39.419
Hey, I am so sorry about
pulling Rachel away the other evening.

10:39.521 --> 10:41.088
I hope it didn't mess anything up.

10:41.190 --> 10:42.710
It's fine. You can't mess anything up.

10:42.758 --> 10:44.191
- Okay.
- It's all good.

10:44.293 --> 10:46.259
Anyway, let's just show
the viewers you're not

10:46.361 --> 10:48.261
some loser who got dumped
and won't give up.

10:48.363 --> 10:51.231
Oh, I can be very convincing
when I need to be.

10:51.333 --> 10:54.668
All right, let's, uh, go get you
ready for the next segment.

10:54.770 --> 10:56.069
Yeah.

10:56.171 --> 10:58.672
- Nice to meet you.
- Mm-hmm.

10:58.774 --> 11:00.540
That guy is shameless.

11:00.642 --> 11:02.375
Mm, he's a possessive,
entitled man-baby.

11:02.478 --> 11:03.610
That's who he's always been.

11:03.712 --> 11:05.245
And yet you guys had a thing, huh?

11:05.347 --> 11:07.314
Hey, I told you, dude, it's, like,

11:07.416 --> 11:09.182
buried like six feet deep somewhere.

11:09.284 --> 11:10.517
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:10.619 --> 11:12.552
'Cause, look, first, it
was Jeremy, and now Adam?

11:12.654 --> 11:15.589
You might not have any feelings
for your set flings,

11:15.691 --> 11:19.159
but they certainly seem to
be harboring a few for you.

11:28.604 --> 11:30.137
Cromwell, I need to talk to you.

11:30.239 --> 11:32.105
- Do you want to jump in now?
- Okay, enough.

11:32.207 --> 11:34.174
I'm not even kidding.
I'm not interested, okay?

11:34.276 --> 11:36.009
So stop with the double talk on camera.

11:36.111 --> 11:37.310
Stop trying to woo me.

11:37.412 --> 11:38.678
Or you could just admit
that you miss me.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.247
Dude, get over yourself.

11:40.349 --> 11:41.648
Rachel, you know what we had.

11:41.750 --> 11:44.518
Yes, what we had was a mistake.

11:44.620 --> 11:48.421
Are you trying to tell me
that what we had was nothing?

11:50.125 --> 11:51.658
Hmm?

11:56.198 --> 11:59.633
I never loved you, okay?

11:59.735 --> 12:01.468
Never.

12:05.007 --> 12:06.439
You never loved loved me?

12:06.542 --> 12:10.190
I never loved you.

12:36.438 --> 12:38.939
I'm really happy.

12:39.041 --> 12:41.274
So leave me alone.

12:51.798 --> 12:54.299
Quinn, are... come on, Quinn.

12:54.401 --> 12:55.500
God.

12:55.602 --> 12:56.901
- I'll give you a minute.
- Why?

12:57.003 --> 12:58.770
You afraid of my undies?

12:58.872 --> 13:00.839
Zip it up.

13:05.612 --> 13:06.945
So I guess I have you to thank

13:07.047 --> 13:08.713
for Booth reaching out to me, huh?

13:08.815 --> 13:11.783
Oh, no, it was all his doing.

13:11.885 --> 13:13.418
Turns out the network

13:13.520 --> 13:15.353
really loves their little boy wonder.

13:15.455 --> 13:17.589
No, I'm saying you
told him to cut Rachel out.

13:17.691 --> 13:18.923
Yeah, I did.

13:19.025 --> 13:21.626
I did that for Booth's sake,
and yours, actually.

13:21.728 --> 13:23.928
Wow, that was so thoughtful of you,

13:24.030 --> 13:26.297
but actually it turns out
Rachel's great at her job.

13:26.399 --> 13:28.199
- Yeah, I know.
- Oh, see, I know you know.

13:28.301 --> 13:29.968
That's why you're
keeping her captive and insecure,

13:30.070 --> 13:31.402
so she won't go anywhere else.

13:31.505 --> 13:32.785
Uh, the thing that makes her tick

13:32.806 --> 13:34.639
also makes bombs explode

13:34.741 --> 13:36.841
with startling frequency around her.

13:36.943 --> 13:40.745
I mean, tattling to the
network, screwing last year's suitor,

13:40.847 --> 13:42.847
this whole ugly mess with Jeremy...

13:42.949 --> 13:45.950
- That was not her fault, actually!
- Absolutely not.

13:46.052 --> 13:49.654
But she's not really capable
of managing things

13:49.756 --> 13:52.557
on a day-to-day basis
like the rest of us.

13:52.659 --> 13:55.894
I keep her in line here, you know?

13:55.996 --> 14:00.565
I mean, do you really want to be
on a full-time bomb squad, hmm?

14:05.805 --> 14:07.505
Rachel's fine, Quinn.

14:07.607 --> 14:09.474
Turns out her big problem is working

14:09.576 --> 14:11.576
for a controlling, manipulative, bitch.

14:11.678 --> 14:14.445
Hmm. At least I'm effective.

14:16.917 --> 14:18.917
You're such a dick.

14:19.019 --> 14:21.853
Ladies, I will help
each of you pick a date

14:21.955 --> 14:25.190
to pitch to Darius...
one that reflects who you are.

14:25.292 --> 14:27.859
And Darius will choose
one date to go on.

14:27.961 --> 14:29.494
Good luck, everyone.

14:29.596 --> 14:31.663
Darius, we have gotten
to know each other

14:31.765 --> 14:33.731
so well over the past few weeks and...

14:33.833 --> 14:36.367
I'm a cop, so people don't always know

14:36.469 --> 14:38.603
how passionate and sexy I can be.

14:38.705 --> 14:41.906
Roaring fire, bottle of wine.

14:42.008 --> 14:46.778
I was supposed to go to Venice
with my fiancé, but...

14:46.880 --> 14:49.814
Let me take you for the
ride of your life.

14:49.916 --> 14:51.983
I want to feel the heat
with you, Darius.

14:52.085 --> 14:54.352
I'm sorry. I don't know
what that date is.

14:54.454 --> 14:55.553
It's sex.

14:55.655 --> 14:57.021
What do you say?

14:58.558 --> 15:01.226
How exciting that
you ladies get a chance

15:01.328 --> 15:03.528
to open yourselves up to Darius.

15:03.630 --> 15:05.897
Rachel, Darius is a freaking
zombie up there.

15:05.999 --> 15:08.333
He's still pissed about Alabama.

15:08.435 --> 15:10.401
Yeah, well, homeboy's been
like that for a while now,

15:10.503 --> 15:11.936
in case you haven't noticed.

15:12.038 --> 15:13.905
You know, maybe having Romeo around
wasn't such a bad thing.

15:14.007 --> 15:16.607
- At least he could actually manage him.
- Ladies, this...

15:16.610 --> 15:18.776
Hey, just a word of
advice, mate, having been where

15:18.878 --> 15:22.513
you are... pick the one
with the dead fiancé.

15:22.616 --> 15:25.316
Right. Did you not see that Bentley?

15:25.418 --> 15:28.653
You know, willingly
spend time with the sob story,

15:28.755 --> 15:31.589
and you're the guy could
never call any woman a bitch.

15:31.691 --> 15:35.260
And come on, there are worse
ways you can spend a few hours.

15:35.362 --> 15:37.629
Darius.

15:37.731 --> 15:40.832
You're facing your toughest choice yet.

15:40.934 --> 15:43.468
But fortunately, you've had
Adam here to help guide you.

15:43.570 --> 15:44.936
Right?

15:45.038 --> 15:46.804
Definitely. Thank you, Graham,

15:46.906 --> 15:48.940
and thank you, Adam.

15:49.042 --> 15:53.945
Ladies, tonight I will be going
on a date with Chantal.

15:56.650 --> 15:58.283
Oh, my gosh, Darius.

15:58.385 --> 15:59.705
Okay, everyone, and that's a cut.

16:02.022 --> 16:04.289
You all right?

16:04.391 --> 16:05.657
I'm good.

16:08.528 --> 16:09.894
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, can I...

16:09.996 --> 16:11.529
Why are you talking to me?

16:11.631 --> 16:13.498
Listen, no one was expecting
you to marry Beth Ann,

16:13.600 --> 16:15.300
but you came off like a gentleman,

16:15.402 --> 16:17.502
the kind that is hire-able
for certain high-profile jobs.

16:17.604 --> 16:20.371
This is a win. I am
on your team, I promise.

16:20.473 --> 16:22.206
Are you not tired of giving the speech?

16:22.309 --> 16:24.275
'Cause I know I'm tired of hearing it.

16:24.377 --> 16:25.474
- Everything all right?
- Why would you

16:25.499 --> 16:26.535
come back here to this snake pit?

16:26.613 --> 16:28.479
- Why? Why?
- Why?

16:28.581 --> 16:29.747
Rachel.

16:29.849 --> 16:31.449
Idiot.

16:32.652 --> 16:34.552
So, you like how I set up Chantal?

16:34.654 --> 16:37.755
I don't care about
Chantal. You want a gold star?

16:37.857 --> 16:40.525
Well, it seemed like you needed
him to at least pretend to care.

16:40.627 --> 16:43.428
It's the kind of nonsense I'm
willing to do to get you back.

16:43.530 --> 16:45.296
Okay, listen, I am with Coleman now.

16:45.398 --> 16:47.432
I'm sorry you can't accept the
fact that I have a boyfriend.

16:47.534 --> 16:48.854
I'm not talking about boyfriends.

16:48.868 --> 16:50.435
- I'm talking about you and I.
- Shh.

16:50.537 --> 16:53.371
Do you have to get...
would you just stop this nonsense?

16:53.473 --> 16:56.908
I want you now, and you want me.

16:59.779 --> 17:02.146
You're... I cannot
do this here right now.

17:02.248 --> 17:06.184
Um...

17:06.286 --> 17:09.686
Okay, meet me in my office
in five minutes.

17:09.789 --> 17:11.723
Five minutes?

17:15.328 --> 17:17.729
Yeah, in five minutes.

17:23.403 --> 17:25.269
Completely
eccentric. I love it. I love it.

17:25.372 --> 17:26.771
I mean, this will work beautifully.

17:26.873 --> 17:28.840
That's everything we
want to do, and we're ta...

17:28.942 --> 17:30.508
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hi. I'm sorry.

17:30.610 --> 17:32.176
I didn't know you guys
were having a meeting.

17:32.278 --> 17:33.811
No, uh, I just wanted to hear some

17:33.913 --> 17:35.713
of Coleman's ideas for new projects.

17:35.815 --> 17:38.783
His ideas? Well, that's so exciting.

17:38.885 --> 17:42.787
But he couldn't stop
talking about his producing partner.

17:42.889 --> 17:46.190
Hmm. It appears you
are a valuable asset.

17:46.292 --> 17:48.192
Must be why no one wants to let you go.

17:48.294 --> 17:49.660
Thank you. That's
very nice of you. Thanks.

17:49.729 --> 17:51.362
Um, look, we'll continue
this later, shall we?

17:51.464 --> 17:53.197
- John, thank you so much.
- Yes, pleasure, pleasure.

17:53.299 --> 17:54.532
That was fantastic.

17:54.634 --> 17:56.601
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry about that.

17:56.703 --> 17:58.403
- I was gonna tell you.
- Hmm.

17:58.505 --> 18:00.538
- I... Quinn was...
- Quinn?

18:00.640 --> 18:01.806
She...

18:01.908 --> 18:03.541
She... what, she was...

18:03.643 --> 18:05.510
- Yeah, of course.
- trying to cut me out.

18:05.612 --> 18:07.678
I wasn't gonna say anything
until I convinced him

18:07.781 --> 18:09.280
to meet with both of us just...

18:09.382 --> 18:10.815
It's okay. You know, what?
It's totally fine.

18:10.917 --> 18:12.483
You could have just pitched him
on your own. It's big deal.

18:12.585 --> 18:14.285
- No, no!
- It's fine.

18:14.387 --> 18:15.653
I couldn't. I couldn't.

18:15.755 --> 18:17.555
This... everything
we want to do together,

18:17.657 --> 18:19.524
all the TV that we want to make...

18:19.626 --> 18:21.626
that's... we're a team.

18:21.728 --> 18:22.827
- Whoa.
- Mm.

18:22.929 --> 18:25.563
Okay. All right.

18:33.406 --> 18:34.939
Can you just hold on one second?

18:35.041 --> 18:36.407
Just give me a second.

18:39.512 --> 18:40.912
What?

18:41.014 --> 18:42.814
Don't tell me you have
to leave right now.

18:42.882 --> 18:44.382
- No, I don't.
- Don't you do that.

18:44.484 --> 18:46.451
It's totally fine.

18:47.821 --> 18:49.520
Rachel Goldberg.

18:49.622 --> 18:51.656
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, okay.

18:51.758 --> 18:53.591
Really? That's what
you wanted me to see?

18:53.693 --> 18:55.760
I'm sorry. Do you want
to get out, please?

18:55.862 --> 18:57.762
Unbelievable.

19:05.731 --> 19:07.239
What did he mean this is what you

19:07.265 --> 19:08.728
- wanted him to see?
- I don't know.

19:08.772 --> 19:10.081
He must have just misunderstood

19:10.106 --> 19:11.964
- something that I'd said.
- He misunderstood?

19:12.042 --> 19:16.311
Look, if there's something
going on here, Rachel, please.

19:16.413 --> 19:18.046
Nothing.

19:18.148 --> 19:21.650
I mean, he's... I
promise you that he's gone,

19:21.752 --> 19:23.685
and that there...
there is nothing going on.

19:23.787 --> 19:25.454
He's just out of our lives for good.

19:25.556 --> 19:27.456
Everyone has baggage.

19:27.558 --> 19:30.058
Okay, I get that. I
have crazy exes, too.

19:30.194 --> 19:31.626
They don't call me at 3:00 A.M.

19:31.729 --> 19:34.329
let alone show up
at my work at 3:00 A.M.

19:34.431 --> 19:36.565
Most of us, we grow up,
and we deal with it.

19:36.667 --> 19:40.469
Do you think this is cute...
the exes popping up, the drama?

19:40.571 --> 19:41.903
I don't.

19:42.005 --> 19:44.406
- I have been so honest with you...
- Mm-hmm.

19:44.508 --> 19:47.442
About everything, about
everything I see for our future.

19:47.544 --> 19:49.578
So just deal with this, please?

19:49.680 --> 19:51.480
I will.

19:53.984 --> 19:54.870
Can someone move those over

19:54.895 --> 19:55.875
- here, please?
- I can barley swim.

19:55.953 --> 19:58.019
- I'm not getting on this. Yes.
- Yes, you are getting on the boat.

19:58.122 --> 20:00.722
No, I'm not getting on the boat.
Well, are you gonna give me a life jacket?

20:00.824 --> 20:01.580
- He is not getting on the boat.
- You don't

20:01.605 --> 20:02.448
- need a life jacket.
- This thing... life jacket?

20:02.526 --> 20:03.825
- Just let me handle this.
- You guys, this isn't a gondola.

20:03.927 --> 20:05.393
- This is a row boat.
- Wait.

20:05.496 --> 20:07.763
Look, I spent $50 on this
boat on Craigslist,

20:07.865 --> 20:09.765
and it's gonna be a gondola by tonight.

20:09.867 --> 20:11.800
Madison! Look, I don't want
to be going on on the boat.

20:11.902 --> 20:13.769
Madison, Madison, look at
how unsafe this is. It's so safe.

20:13.837 --> 20:15.504
- You're not gonna fire me.
- What are you doing here?

20:15.606 --> 20:18.473
Great to see you,
too, Rach. Darius called.

20:18.575 --> 20:21.009
He's not exactly happy with
the way things are going here.

20:21.111 --> 20:23.779
I can't say I blame him.

20:25.549 --> 20:27.649
You laughing at me?

20:27.751 --> 20:29.584
- It's fun, isn't it?
- Yeah, it is.

20:29.686 --> 20:31.520
You look so handsome with that on.

20:31.622 --> 20:33.588
And you look beautiful.

20:33.690 --> 20:35.824
Mm, are you kidding?

20:37.494 --> 20:39.661
- You know?
- Wait.

20:39.763 --> 20:42.464
- I have three brothers.
- You're kidding.

20:42.566 --> 20:44.699
No, well, two and then Romeo.

20:44.802 --> 20:47.469
- Hmm.
- How did I not know this?

20:47.571 --> 20:49.504
Because we haven't gotten

20:49.606 --> 20:52.407
the chance to talk,
and that's not on you.

20:52.509 --> 20:54.376
That's on me.

20:54.478 --> 20:56.011
'Cause I know I've been made into this

20:56.113 --> 21:00.582
one-note character...
girl with the dead fiancé.

21:00.684 --> 21:02.884
And I know that you
might think that I'm not ready

21:02.986 --> 21:05.854
to move on or that I'm
not open, but I am.

21:05.989 --> 21:07.956
And I want to prove that to you.

21:08.058 --> 21:09.524
Well done. I'm impressed.

21:09.626 --> 21:11.660
They give me $150,
and this is what I do.

21:11.762 --> 21:13.195
Hey, Rachel?

21:15.666 --> 21:17.632
I thought you were gone.

21:17.701 --> 21:20.101
I was on my way back to the hotel,

21:20.204 --> 21:22.404
but I realized I had
to look you in the face

21:22.506 --> 21:26.641
and ask you why are you still
here with Quinn in this place.

21:26.743 --> 21:29.611
You don't get to judge me
just because you're jealous.

21:29.713 --> 21:31.046
- Jealous?
- Yes.

21:31.148 --> 21:32.914
Jealous that you're desperately
banging your boss

21:33.016 --> 21:34.576
in the hopes he takes you up the ladder

21:34.618 --> 21:36.418
in the the gaping hell hole
that is "Everlasting"?

21:36.520 --> 21:38.019
Okay, he's so much more than my boss.

21:38.121 --> 21:39.888
He invited me to his cousin's wedding...

21:39.990 --> 21:41.723
on Martha's Vineyard.

21:41.825 --> 21:43.458
Do you hear yourself?

21:43.560 --> 21:44.893
Wake up.

21:44.995 --> 21:47.829
This place is a vortex
of evil and dysfunction

21:47.931 --> 21:50.398
turning everything it touches to shit.

21:50.500 --> 21:52.434
How do you not see that?
It's ruining your life.

21:52.536 --> 21:54.502
And, what, you're some,
like, moral authority now?

21:54.605 --> 21:58.073
You, like, kiss a few
AIDS babies for some photo op,

21:58.175 --> 21:59.855
and you think that you're
doing God's work?

21:59.943 --> 22:01.076
I'm actually helping people.

22:01.178 --> 22:02.510
- Really?
- Yes.

22:02.613 --> 22:04.013
Tell me, who do... who do you think

22:04.014 --> 22:05.380
you're actually helping here?

22:05.482 --> 22:07.649
Um, the 16 million people who watch

22:07.751 --> 22:09.718
my television show every week.

22:09.853 --> 22:12.554
Okay, I have single-handedly
broken down

22:12.656 --> 22:15.624
all of these
preconceived notions on love and race

22:15.726 --> 22:17.058
because Coleman and I,

22:17.160 --> 22:19.394
we are making television that matters.

22:19.496 --> 22:20.816
I don't know if you've noticed it,

22:20.831 --> 22:22.564
but we actually have
the first black suitor.

22:22.666 --> 22:24.099
That's groundbreaking.

22:24.201 --> 22:26.368
- Your black suitor...
- Mm-hmm.

22:26.470 --> 22:30.071
Is on a fake date in a fake
boat on a fake lake.

22:30.173 --> 22:31.706
That is "Everlasting,"

22:31.808 --> 22:34.042
and you're completely delusional.

22:44.454 --> 22:46.388
All right, well...

22:47.724 --> 22:52.460
I'm going to show you that I'm ready.

22:52.562 --> 22:54.429
- Darius.
- Yeah?

22:54.531 --> 22:57.666
These are the ashes of my fiancé.

22:57.768 --> 23:00.802
And I'm want let him
go here with you tonight

23:00.904 --> 23:02.167
so that my heart can be

23:02.192 --> 23:03.729
- ready to love again.
- What?

23:03.807 --> 23:05.507
- Fan, fan, fan.
- Okay, wait, what?

23:05.609 --> 23:07.442
Hey, get in there with the
fan. Make it blow hard.

23:07.544 --> 23:09.544
Ashes are... I just want to show you,
Darius, that I'm ready for this.

23:09.646 --> 23:11.746
No, wait you don't...
you don't have to... oh, my!

23:11.848 --> 23:13.481
What?! Oh, my God, Darius!

23:13.583 --> 23:15.383
- I'm so sorry!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

23:15.452 --> 23:17.085
Wait, come here. Oh, my God,
dead guy in my mouth!

23:17.187 --> 23:19.020
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry, Darius.
- Okay, cut, everyone, cut.

23:19.122 --> 23:20.989
Let's reset. Let's take 20.

23:21.091 --> 23:23.959
Rachel, are you okay?

23:29.733 --> 23:32.667
How nice. Adam came back.

23:32.769 --> 23:34.636
How does that feel?

23:34.738 --> 23:36.071
That's got to feel good, right?

23:36.173 --> 23:38.006
- Hmm?
- He's fighting for you.

23:38.108 --> 23:41.977
- He's here for you.
- Yeah, it didn't work... um, your plan.

23:42.079 --> 23:45.780
You know, the using Adam
to break up Coleman and me?

23:45.882 --> 23:47.361
What were you gonna do? Did you want to

23:47.386 --> 23:49.026
keep me all to
yourself, or did you, uh...

23:49.052 --> 23:51.012
you wanted me to, like,
come crawling back to you?

23:51.054 --> 23:52.807
- What was it?
- I wanted to show

23:52.832 --> 23:54.947
you Coleman for who he really is.

23:55.025 --> 23:56.725
Okay, I know who Coleman really is.

23:56.827 --> 23:58.660
He's the new showrunner that
they brought in to replace you.

23:58.762 --> 24:00.462
And yet you're still here.

24:00.564 --> 24:02.664
I mean, you seriously have
this, like, great guy,

24:02.766 --> 24:04.599
and you're spending
all of your time here

24:04.701 --> 24:07.002
trying to ruin my life.

24:07.104 --> 24:09.671
You need to get over me.

24:09.773 --> 24:11.539
Get over you?

24:11.641 --> 24:13.074
Mm-hmm.

24:13.176 --> 24:14.843
No.

24:16.813 --> 24:18.053
"No"? What does that even mean?

24:18.148 --> 24:19.814
You're, like, obsessed with me, okay?

24:19.883 --> 24:22.450
Get a life.

24:28.091 --> 24:30.825
There you are.

24:30.927 --> 24:32.360
Uh, here I am.

24:32.462 --> 24:33.628
Mm-hmm.

24:33.730 --> 24:36.431
But I'd really like to be anywhere else.

24:36.533 --> 24:37.999
- Well, then, uh...
- So, let's go.

24:38.101 --> 24:39.467
Yeah, let's get out of here.

24:39.569 --> 24:41.436
How about, uh, Post Ranch Inn?

24:41.538 --> 24:43.671
Aah!

24:43.774 --> 24:45.040
It's like... it's like
they're hell-bent

24:45.142 --> 24:46.741
- on making me look like a fool.
- I know, I know.

24:46.843 --> 24:48.523
- I can't have one normal date?
- Okay, so...

24:48.545 --> 24:49.978
- One normal date?!
- So, what do you want to do, D?

24:50.080 --> 24:51.313
You trying to get up out of here?

24:51.314 --> 24:52.412
You damn right I want to get out

24:52.437 --> 24:53.672
- of here.
- Let's get up out of here.

24:53.750 --> 24:55.417
- Mnh-mnh, cheers!
- Yes.

24:55.519 --> 24:57.479
- Darius, why didn't you pick me?
- I do not know.

24:57.487 --> 24:58.920
Okay, I must have been
out of my damn mind.

24:59.022 --> 25:00.655
You girls want to have some fun?

25:00.757 --> 25:02.524
- Hell, yeah.
- That Bentley's still in the driveway.

25:02.592 --> 25:03.912
- Yes, it is!
- Let's go. Come on.

25:03.927 --> 25:05.727
- Let's go, come on.
- Hurry up. Hurry up.

25:05.829 --> 25:06.712
Let's go. Let's go.

25:06.737 --> 25:07.686
Yes, I like where your head's at!

25:07.764 --> 25:08.473
Perfect.

25:08.498 --> 25:09.521
- Don't fall.
- I'm not falling.

25:09.599 --> 25:10.799
- Thank you.
- Come on.

25:15.739 --> 25:17.405
Hey.

25:17.507 --> 25:20.542
What are you up to?

25:20.644 --> 25:22.710
Photo kills.

25:22.813 --> 25:25.413
- Budget approvals.
- Hmm, fun stuff.

25:25.515 --> 25:27.348
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

25:27.451 --> 25:30.051
Um, well, I wanted
to tell you that I think

25:30.153 --> 25:33.888
that you were right about
all of my baggage.

25:33.990 --> 25:35.957
I don't think it's cute.

25:36.059 --> 25:39.527
I totally get it.

25:39.629 --> 25:41.529
- Okay.
- Okay?

25:41.631 --> 25:44.499
I do want to change.

25:44.601 --> 25:46.935
Okay, I want to be with you.

25:47.037 --> 25:48.503
You know, I, like, want to go

25:48.605 --> 25:50.004
with you to your cousin's wedding.

25:50.107 --> 25:51.973
I want to make groundbreaking television

25:52.075 --> 25:53.708
that we've talked about together.

25:53.810 --> 25:56.111
I want... I just really
want to do it all with you.

25:58.748 --> 26:02.784
Could you please say something?

26:02.886 --> 26:05.820
Rachel, they're taking the car.

26:08.725 --> 26:10.859
Go for Rachel. What's going on, Madison?

26:10.961 --> 26:13.461
Rachel, they're taking the car.

26:13.563 --> 26:15.296
- Who is taking...
- Oh, damn it! Darius.

26:15.398 --> 26:16.664
- What?
- What are they doing?

26:16.766 --> 26:18.700
- Wait, pull up the feed.
- Right there. Madison?

26:18.768 --> 26:20.368
They're gonna take
it. I can't stop them.

26:20.470 --> 26:22.003
How is that possible?

26:23.907 --> 26:26.007
Coleman, we should just call the cops.

26:26.109 --> 26:28.376
- What?
- Don't you see?

26:28.478 --> 26:29.599
This is the show that we want to make

26:29.624 --> 26:30.802
- right here.
- What are you talking about?

26:30.881 --> 26:31.881
We have to call the cops.

26:31.882 --> 26:33.071
On two black guys in
a Bentley in this town?

26:33.150 --> 26:35.416
- That won't end well.
- Exactly.

26:38.588 --> 26:40.855
- Make the call.
- Okay.

26:43.093 --> 26:46.094
Hi, yes, I'd like
to report a stolen car.

26:46.196 --> 26:49.631
Can you get "C" cam in a van?

26:49.733 --> 26:51.666
Hey, uh, Madison,
drop everything right now

26:51.768 --> 26:53.902
and get "C" cam in a
van for us right now.

27:02.005 --> 27:04.239
I'm so glad to be out of that house.

27:04.341 --> 27:07.075
If I had been cooped up
with a bunch of bitches

27:07.177 --> 27:09.177
for one more minute, I was gonna scream.

27:09.279 --> 27:11.680
- Ooh.
- Oh, my God. No, not you.

27:11.782 --> 27:13.081
- No offense.
- It's fine.

27:14.918 --> 27:16.384
- Hold up, hold up.
- Ohh!

27:16.487 --> 27:18.253
Hold on. It's fine.

27:18.355 --> 27:20.055
Someone's getting in trouble.

27:20.157 --> 27:21.923
- No, it's fine.
- All right, stay cool.

27:22.025 --> 27:24.192
Stay cool... two Darius Beck autographs

27:24.294 --> 27:26.128
for our friends in blue,
and we are green.

27:26.230 --> 27:27.652
- Trust me.
- Hey, where's

27:27.677 --> 27:29.421
my Darius Beck autograph?

27:42.346 --> 27:45.480
We've got the 10851, four occupants.

27:45.582 --> 27:47.015
We're approaching the vehicle.

27:47.117 --> 27:48.850
- I got you, baby,
- What if we get...

27:50.487 --> 27:51.953
Hi, there, officer.

27:52.055 --> 27:53.375
License and registration, please.

27:53.390 --> 27:56.091
Listen, I'm Darius Beck,
pro football player.

27:56.193 --> 27:57.826
The quarterback? Is it him?

27:57.928 --> 28:00.095
- Yeah.
- I can't... I'm not sure.

28:00.197 --> 28:02.097
I need to see some I.D.

28:02.199 --> 28:04.299
- Oh, my.
- Oh.

28:04.401 --> 28:08.136
Um, look. This is crazy.

28:08.238 --> 28:09.938
Look, I don't have my I.D. on me.

28:10.040 --> 28:12.340
They took it back at the, um...

28:12.442 --> 28:14.709
I'm on a reality show, okay?

28:14.812 --> 28:16.332
- And they... - W-we're
on "Everlasting."

28:16.380 --> 28:17.946
- Yeah.
- We're all on "Everlasting."

28:18.048 --> 28:19.381
Yeah, no phone, no wallet.

28:19.483 --> 28:21.483
If you guys are on the show,
where are the cameras?

28:21.485 --> 28:23.785
Look, this isn't part of it, okay?

28:23.887 --> 28:25.854
I'm just taking
these girls out for a spin.

28:25.956 --> 28:26.796
- Yeah.
- All right, but

28:26.821 --> 28:27.913
listen, I'm Darius Beck.

28:27.991 --> 28:30.125
One of us is gonna marry him!

28:30.227 --> 28:32.327
- Tiffany.
- Miss, are you okay?

28:32.429 --> 28:34.029
No, she's fine.
She's just had too much to...

28:34.131 --> 28:35.297
I'm not talking to you.

28:35.399 --> 28:36.832
I'm gonna need an answer from you, miss.

28:36.934 --> 28:38.400
- Are you okay?
- Look, I'm for real.

28:38.502 --> 28:40.368
She's fine. She had too much to drink.

28:40.470 --> 28:41.903
- And he really is Darius Beck.
- She's not talking to you!

28:42.005 --> 28:43.138
This car's been reported stolen.

28:43.240 --> 28:44.472
- I can't see.
- What? - Whoa.

28:44.575 --> 28:46.308
Sir, I need you to step out of the car.

28:46.410 --> 28:48.376
You have it wrong... all wrong.

28:48.478 --> 28:50.078
Step out of the vehicle right now.

28:50.180 --> 28:51.713
Officer Pyne, get the
driver out of the car

28:51.815 --> 28:53.982
and get the situation under control.

28:54.084 --> 28:54.708
No, you do not have to do that.

28:54.733 --> 28:55.407
They have to have
cause to make you get out.

28:55.485 --> 28:56.965
I said shut up. You don't talk to him.

28:56.987 --> 28:58.253
Get out! Out! That's right. Let's go.

28:58.355 --> 28:59.721
- Get out of the car.
- All right, look, I'm out.

28:59.823 --> 29:00.956
- Go on, turn around.
- I'm out, okay?

29:01.058 --> 29:02.258
- Turn around.
- Okay, I'm out.

29:02.292 --> 29:03.892
- Do not lay your hands on him!
- Ow!

29:03.994 --> 29:05.160
Keep your hands where I can
see them! Get out of the car!

29:05.262 --> 29:06.995
Get out of the car!

29:07.097 --> 29:09.264
- No, no, we got to do something.
- No, no, no, no, no, not yet.

29:09.366 --> 29:12.200
This is how you know when
you're getting good stuff...

29:12.302 --> 29:14.035
stuff that matters... when it's hard.

29:14.137 --> 29:16.257
Hey, look, you don't know
who I am? Whoa, hey!

29:16.273 --> 29:18.139
Yeah, yeah, well, we don't
care who you are.

29:18.242 --> 29:20.008
- Ah, wait.
- Hands behind your back.

29:20.110 --> 29:22.377
- You don't know who I am. Listen.
- Stop it! He's not okay.

29:22.446 --> 29:23.745
I'm gonna sue. Now, look.

29:23.847 --> 29:25.113
You think we haven't heard that before?

29:25.215 --> 29:27.048
Wait!

29:27.150 --> 29:28.817
- Stop! It's his back! -
Control the suspect! - Be careful!

29:28.919 --> 29:30.318
No, no, no, I'm stopping this now.

29:30.420 --> 29:33.188
Rachel, wait. Rachel! Rachel!

29:33.290 --> 29:34.890
Hey, I'm Rachel Goldberg!

29:34.992 --> 29:36.391
I'm the one who called! Don't hurt him!

29:36.493 --> 29:37.792
- Back up!
- Don't hurt him!

29:48.939 --> 29:51.873
Back up, back up! I said back up!

29:51.975 --> 29:53.208
I'm unarmed! I'm unarmed!

29:53.310 --> 29:56.811
- What did you do?!
- I came when it happened.

29:56.914 --> 29:58.980
Rachel, what are we doing?!

29:59.082 --> 30:01.116
Rachel!

30:01.218 --> 30:04.019
He's been shot! Can we
get him an ambulance, please?

30:06.056 --> 30:08.123
I still have a pulse.

30:12.445 --> 30:14.787
Hmm. Ohh!

30:16.757 --> 30:17.957
The office again?

30:18.059 --> 30:20.526
Mm. You're right.

30:20.628 --> 30:24.129
It gets easier every time
you don't answer it.

30:24.232 --> 30:26.665
Told you. It's the secret to life.

30:26.767 --> 30:28.100
Delegate.

30:28.202 --> 30:30.703
Mm.

30:30.805 --> 30:32.838
Oh, please, please, make it stop.

30:32.940 --> 30:34.707
Keep saying the dirty word, please.

30:34.809 --> 30:36.709
Delegate, delegate, delegate.

30:36.811 --> 30:38.377
- Mm.
- I'll tell you what?

30:38.479 --> 30:41.547
I'll do you one better than that.

30:43.551 --> 30:44.917
Huh?

30:46.821 --> 30:49.455
And how's that?

30:49.557 --> 30:52.091
That is very, very dirty.

30:57.832 --> 31:03.636
Look, if we're really gonna
do this, there's, uh,

31:03.738 --> 31:05.337
something I need to tell you.

31:05.439 --> 31:07.439
You're the weirdest
person I've ever met.

31:09.644 --> 31:12.044
And...

31:12.146 --> 31:15.447
And I feel I may be
falling in love with you.

31:15.550 --> 31:17.883
And I can't believe I'm saying this...

31:17.985 --> 31:21.120
I want children.

31:21.222 --> 31:22.888
More than one, less than five,

31:22.990 --> 31:25.891
but our children... me and
my hypothetical partner

31:25.993 --> 31:29.128
in this endeavor, who, theoretically,

31:29.230 --> 31:31.931
could end up being you.

31:32.033 --> 31:36.635
Unless that's something
that's not in your plan.

31:38.773 --> 31:42.875
I never expected this
to happen between us.

31:42.977 --> 31:47.780
I never meet anybody I actually...

31:49.917 --> 31:51.517
Yeah.

31:51.619 --> 31:52.718
Me, neither.

32:06.033 --> 32:07.993
Detective, detective,
that's my employee.

32:08.002 --> 32:09.635
Ms. Goldberg... You are legally
not allowed to talk to her

32:09.737 --> 32:11.637
without a lawyer
present. You know that, detective.

32:11.706 --> 32:13.772
- We'll get you out of here.
- I need to talk to Ms. Goldberg.

32:13.874 --> 32:16.675
Go around and check up on
the girls for me right now.

32:16.777 --> 32:19.578
I need them to not be saying
anything that's harmful.

32:19.680 --> 32:22.014
It's my fault.

32:22.116 --> 32:23.956
If I hadn't run out,
he wouldn't have shot him.

32:23.985 --> 32:25.625
It's my fault. You can
see it right there.

32:25.720 --> 32:27.353
- Like, look really quickly.
- I got it, I got it. Stop.

32:27.455 --> 32:29.588
It's not your fault. It's was the cops.

32:29.690 --> 32:30.889
- You know that.
- Mm.

32:30.992 --> 32:32.124
They were out of line.

32:32.226 --> 32:33.993
I'm gonna handle them right now.

32:34.061 --> 32:37.563
I just need you to go and take
care of the contestants, okay?

32:37.665 --> 32:40.866
I'm gonna take care of you.

32:40.968 --> 32:42.635
Okay.

32:45.573 --> 32:47.673
Thank you.

32:47.775 --> 32:49.475
Detective, where were we?

32:49.577 --> 32:52.745
It still works?

32:52.847 --> 32:55.981
Did I forget to mention
that it does that?

32:59.020 --> 33:01.987
Ooh, it's the network.

33:02.089 --> 33:05.424
This one you can't delegate.

33:05.526 --> 33:07.593
Hello, Gary.

33:07.695 --> 33:10.362
It's a little late to...

33:10.464 --> 33:12.531
Wait, slow down. Slow down.

33:12.633 --> 33:18.671
Take a breath, Gary. Breathe.

33:18.773 --> 33:20.039
Wow.

33:20.141 --> 33:21.707
Okay, yes.

33:21.809 --> 33:24.710
That is unfortunate. I agree.

33:24.812 --> 33:28.914
And Coleman certainly
dropped the ball, Gary.

33:29.016 --> 33:30.749
Yes, I will be there right away.

33:30.851 --> 33:32.551
I-I will handle everything.

33:32.653 --> 33:33.852
Yes.

33:33.954 --> 33:35.054
Okay.

33:37.892 --> 33:39.972
- No, not right now.
- I can't believe this happened.

33:40.027 --> 33:41.927
They shouldn't have taken the car.

33:42.029 --> 33:44.630
Oh, what... but they should
have gotten pulled over for no reason?

33:45.866 --> 33:48.467
Rachel called the cops.

33:48.569 --> 33:51.970
I told her they took the car,
and she... Wait, what did you...

33:52.073 --> 33:55.107
Rachel called the police and
then went out there to film it?

33:55.209 --> 33:57.543
For real?

33:57.645 --> 34:00.079
Hm... yeah.

34:06.787 --> 34:09.388
You know, I have eaten this crap

34:09.456 --> 34:11.857
for so long now, and that's on me.

34:11.958 --> 34:15.860
But you, with your preachy,
holier-than-thou bullshit...

34:15.963 --> 34:17.663
first, you pat yourself on the black

34:17.764 --> 34:19.931
for getting a black suitor
and contestants who get

34:20.034 --> 34:22.067
treated like
garbage, and now your plan is

34:22.168 --> 34:23.768
to, what, Rachel, just expose

34:23.871 --> 34:26.071
how racist the police are
by getting a brother shot?

34:26.172 --> 34:31.009
If Romeo dies, this is all on you.

34:31.112 --> 34:34.112
And this is not your story to tell.

34:34.215 --> 34:36.681
So why don't you stop trying to help

34:36.784 --> 34:38.817
because there's a very good chance

34:38.918 --> 34:41.887
everyone might be
better off without you?

34:54.534 --> 34:55.706
- Rachel.
- Rachel.

34:55.731 --> 34:56.958
I want to see Darius.

34:57.036 --> 34:59.638
Rachel, what happened?
What did the officers say?

34:59.740 --> 35:01.660
It was terrifying.

35:01.709 --> 35:03.642
This is going off on another
tangent all together.

35:03.744 --> 35:05.377
- I can't right now.
- Do you know where we are?

35:05.479 --> 35:07.012
- Rachel?
- Rachel, are you okay?

35:11.752 --> 35:13.185
Geez.

35:26.066 --> 35:27.499
Hey.

35:27.601 --> 35:29.635
You're here?

35:29.737 --> 35:31.457
Yeah, Chet called. He
told me what happened.

35:31.539 --> 35:33.579
Are you, uh... hey,
look, I'm... Can you just leave?

35:33.641 --> 35:35.040
Look, I'm sorry for what I said earlier.

35:35.142 --> 35:38.443
I'm... I didn't... I was lashing out.

35:38.546 --> 35:41.680
- So I'm sorry. I...
- Can you just please leave?

35:41.782 --> 35:44.683
No, I'm not running away.

35:44.785 --> 35:48.053
I'm here for you, so let me help.

35:50.858 --> 35:52.691
Uh, I know we loved each other, Rachel.

35:52.793 --> 35:53.926
I've never stopped loving...

35:54.028 --> 35:55.627
Dude, can you just stop, please?

35:55.729 --> 35:57.763
We did love each other,
and you left, okay?

35:57.865 --> 35:59.282
- Well, I'm here now.
- There was, like,

35:59.307 --> 36:00.545
this tiny, little window of hope

36:00.568 --> 36:02.768
where you could have, like,
saved me, and you didn't.

36:02.870 --> 36:04.570
And now every single thing inside of me

36:04.672 --> 36:06.371
is just, like, this little black hole.

36:06.473 --> 36:07.940
It's, like, dead inside.

36:08.008 --> 36:09.474
Okay.

36:09.577 --> 36:11.476
I know that, but I'm here now.

36:11.579 --> 36:13.478
- Please, can you just go?
- Rachel.

36:13.581 --> 36:16.548
It's too late! Can you please go?!

36:16.650 --> 36:17.749
Rachel, don't.

36:17.852 --> 36:19.718
Can you please just go?!

37:19.580 --> 37:22.047
- Rachel?
- Mom?

37:26.231 --> 37:28.397
"Meet me on the balcony"?
What's up with the mystery text?

37:28.500 --> 37:30.900
I wanted you to meet me on the balcony.

37:31.002 --> 37:32.401
Great. Look.

37:32.504 --> 37:34.403
I don't really have time
for secret meetings right now.

37:34.506 --> 37:35.972
We have a bit of a situation inside,

37:36.074 --> 37:37.740
- in case you haven't noticed.
- Oh, a situation?

37:37.842 --> 37:39.876
No, what you have is the
shit show of the century.

37:39.978 --> 37:42.345
I leave you for one night. What
the hell were you thinking?

37:42.447 --> 37:45.114
Um, maybe that I got you
the most amazing footage

37:45.216 --> 37:48.451
of possibly the most
important story this show has ever even...

37:48.553 --> 37:50.520
You put our suitor in the hospital.

37:50.622 --> 37:53.222
You got Romeo shot,
and you filled my mansion

37:53.324 --> 37:55.324
with cops and lawyers.
- Would you give me a break?

37:55.326 --> 37:56.993
Oh, that's exactly what you're getting.

37:57.095 --> 37:58.295
Go home, Coleman. You're done.

37:58.396 --> 37:59.729
Excuse me? I'm sorry.

37:59.831 --> 38:01.311
It sounded like you told me I'm done.

38:01.366 --> 38:02.932
You don't really have that authority

38:03.034 --> 38:04.767
because I happen to be...
- The showrunner?

38:04.869 --> 38:06.736
Yeah, not anymore. It's me again.

38:06.838 --> 38:08.971
I mean, actually, it kind of always was.

38:09.073 --> 38:11.941
Let's just admit that, but
Gary just made it official.

38:12.043 --> 38:14.177
- I don't believe you.
- Yeah, well, you know what?

38:14.279 --> 38:16.812
Why don't you just
call Gary from your phone

38:16.915 --> 38:19.482
in your car on your way home?

38:22.587 --> 38:24.487
Rachel.

38:24.589 --> 38:26.923
Who's that?

38:29.194 --> 38:31.260
Rachel's mother.

39:00.291 --> 39:02.892
Oh, my God, thank you for coming.

39:05.230 --> 39:08.130
Hey, hey, what the hell
happened in there?

39:10.501 --> 39:13.302
All I know is that Romeo
was shot five feet from me.

39:13.404 --> 39:15.738
I mean, I was so scared.

39:15.840 --> 39:19.875
I mean... this is a reality show.

39:19.978 --> 39:22.044
How could this happen?

39:22.146 --> 39:25.114
Like I said, you
don't know the half of it.

39:25.216 --> 39:28.251
Jeremy, just tell me.

39:28.353 --> 39:29.752
Okay.

39:55.847 --> 39:57.947
Rachel?

39:58.049 --> 40:00.383
Sit up, sweetheart.

40:00.485 --> 40:02.051
Okay.

40:05.890 --> 40:07.256
Here.

40:12.030 --> 40:14.330
Take the medicine, sweetheart.

40:14.432 --> 40:17.199
That's how you get better.

40:29.113 --> 40:32.952
You know I love you, right?
