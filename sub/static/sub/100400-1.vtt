00:00.033 --> 00:02.687
Previously on "Grey's Anatomy"
and "Station 19"...

00:02.711 --> 00:05.422
- I'm pregnant.
- Oh, we're having a baby!

00:06.474 --> 00:07.505
Everything okay?

00:07.529 --> 00:09.851
- I think it's best if you... go.
- Okay.

00:09.875 --> 00:11.108
- Dr. Avery.
- Jackson.

00:11.132 --> 00:12.376
Victoria.

00:12.400 --> 00:16.746
I am just getting out of
a pretty serious relationship.

00:16.770 --> 00:18.948
Me... Me, too. He died.

00:18.972 --> 00:20.249
I'm really sorry to hear that.

00:20.273 --> 00:22.218
- Dr. Bailey.
- Captain Herrera.

00:22.242 --> 00:24.120
Please don't tell your husband
my cancer's back.

00:24.144 --> 00:26.244
Dr. Bailey, you're bleeding.

00:28.849 --> 00:30.693
Oh, Ben. Please.

00:30.717 --> 00:34.163
Um... I-I know... I know
this is a-a loss for you, too,

00:34.187 --> 00:37.233
but I'm asking you to just
leave me alone f-for now.

00:37.257 --> 00:38.756
Why were you at the hospital?

02:01.977 --> 02:03.455
Physical rescue.

02:03.479 --> 02:04.923
Motor vehicle into a business

02:04.947 --> 02:09.127
at 4397 Northeast Sequoia Avenue.

02:09.151 --> 02:11.463
All 19 units respond.

02:42.187 --> 02:43.831
Please help!

02:59.071 --> 03:01.032
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.987
Was that a bomb?

03:03.011 --> 03:04.856
- Oh, my God!
- Are we in the Green Zone?

03:04.880 --> 03:06.224
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

03:06.248 --> 03:07.558
- Simms is bleeding!
- Oh, my God.

03:07.582 --> 03:09.027
- Somebody help him!
- Oh, my God.

03:09.051 --> 03:11.129
Are you okay, son?

03:11.153 --> 03:13.731
- Oh, my God!
- Calm down. Levi, calm down.

03:13.755 --> 03:15.533
- Let's go. Let's help.
- Kim, over here.

03:15.557 --> 03:18.369
Help me move this stuff
so we can get to Simms.

03:18.393 --> 03:20.271
Help! Help!

03:20.295 --> 03:22.040
Warren! This car could be leaking gas!

03:22.064 --> 03:23.741
Okay, let's get everybody
up and bring them to the front.

03:25.233 --> 03:26.644
Wait a minute.

03:30.036 --> 03:32.548
Yeah, that's not good.

03:33.940 --> 03:39.428
Synced & corrected by -robtor-

03:41.848 --> 03:43.247
Taste.

03:45.051 --> 03:46.061
Ooh, that's good.

03:46.085 --> 03:48.330
Yeah, spicy and sweet...

03:48.354 --> 03:49.365
...like you.

03:49.389 --> 03:50.566
Ew.

03:50.590 --> 03:51.834
Oh, you think you're salty.

03:51.858 --> 03:54.069
I think we shouldn't compare me
to your Bolognese.

03:54.093 --> 03:56.438
Okay, uh, maybe we could get

03:56.462 --> 03:59.108
some more cooking
and a little less of... of that.

03:59.132 --> 04:00.816
I told you. I told him.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.452
- You did tell him.
- I remember.

04:02.476 --> 04:03.954
Okay, so, "I told you so"?

04:03.978 --> 04:05.656
That's the comfort
you guys have to offer me?

04:05.680 --> 04:07.391
Well, if it makes you feel
any better, you're not alone.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.193
Nikki leaves a trail
of broken hearts in her wake

04:09.217 --> 04:10.360
wherever she goes.

04:10.384 --> 04:12.596
Somehow that doesn't
make me feel any better.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.407
Hey, brought the balloons.

04:14.441 --> 04:15.785
Pink and blue and yellow and green

04:15.809 --> 04:17.220
'cause gender's not a binary.

04:17.244 --> 04:19.889
And this is, um, Dr. Jackson Avery.

04:19.913 --> 04:20.857
- Hey, brother.
- Hey.

04:20.880 --> 04:22.058
Uh, you a friend of Warren's?

04:22.082 --> 04:23.514
Yeah. And Bailey.

04:23.539 --> 04:24.390
Hey. Hey.

04:24.414 --> 04:25.725
- Hey.
- How you doing?

04:25.749 --> 04:28.116
- He's also a-a friend of mine.
- Hey.

04:30.554 --> 04:32.921
- Yes. It's true.
- Yeah.

04:35.259 --> 04:37.504
- That's great. This is great.
- Thank you, Travis.

04:37.528 --> 04:39.272
Nice to meet you, Jackson Avery.

04:39.296 --> 04:40.607
I'm starving, though, man.

04:40.631 --> 04:41.975
No! No! No! No!

04:41.999 --> 04:43.033
What's all this?

04:43.058 --> 04:44.711
You were supposed to keep him in the gym!

04:44.735 --> 04:45.778
It was supposed to be a surprise.

04:45.802 --> 04:48.014
- Look, I tried.
- I got hungry, though.

04:48.038 --> 04:49.349
You had one job.

04:49.373 --> 04:50.950
Firehouse baby!

04:55.756 --> 04:57.000
Help! Help!

04:57.024 --> 04:59.736
- Any fuel leaks?
- None that I can see.

05:00.021 --> 05:01.465
The stairwell's
completely blocked by debris,

05:01.489 --> 05:02.733
and that wall's not stable.

05:02.757 --> 05:04.301
We got to get everyone out of here.

05:04.325 --> 05:05.802
- Back door?
- Up... Up the stairs.

05:05.826 --> 05:07.504
Hey, hey, Herrera, Herrera,
someone else can go.

05:07.528 --> 05:08.805
Warren, I swear to God,

05:08.829 --> 05:11.308
you start treating me
like I'm dying, I'll kill you.

05:11.332 --> 05:13.804
Schmitt, I need hands here, please.

05:14.118 --> 05:15.250
Now!

05:15.813 --> 05:17.391
Hey, hey, hey. You need to get in there.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.053
I know they're your friends,
but you're trained for this.

05:19.078 --> 05:20.989
- Go. Go!
- Okay. Okay.

05:22.560 --> 05:24.237
You... You all right, man? You hurt?

05:24.261 --> 05:25.405
Car came through the wall.

05:25.429 --> 05:26.940
Yeah. Yeah... Yeah, it did.

05:26.964 --> 05:28.675
Help!

05:32.336 --> 05:34.269
Come on!

05:37.675 --> 05:38.919
Give us a hand over here?

05:38.943 --> 05:40.520
Help!

05:41.846 --> 05:43.739
Nice and steady, all right? On my count.

05:43.764 --> 05:45.442
One, two, three.

05:45.466 --> 05:47.410
- Help! Can anybody hear?!
- There we go.

05:47.434 --> 05:49.212
Can somebody hear me?!

05:49.540 --> 05:50.484
Watch yourself.

05:50.508 --> 05:52.386
Is somebody there?!

05:52.410 --> 05:53.954
All right, now, grab the base.
Grab the base.

05:58.649 --> 06:00.460
Ma'am, roll... Roll down your windo...

06:00.484 --> 06:02.396
Ma'am! Roll down your window!

06:02.420 --> 06:03.797
I-I need help!

06:03.821 --> 06:06.407
Okay, I'm here to help you.
Now, just turn off the car.

06:06.449 --> 06:07.827
Ma'am? Turn off the car.

06:07.851 --> 06:09.795
No, no, no! Put the lights back on!

06:09.819 --> 06:11.297
I just... Put the lights back on.

06:11.321 --> 06:12.131
Oh.

06:13.723 --> 06:15.268
Ma'am? Are you hurt?

06:15.292 --> 06:17.811
- No, but my husband...
- Husband?

06:17.836 --> 06:19.880
Ugh. Okay. I-I need to get up higher.

06:19.904 --> 06:21.315
Hey, can you, uh, run
and get me a box or a keg

06:21.339 --> 06:23.217
or something I can stack
on top of this table?

06:23.241 --> 06:24.952
- I need to get higher.
- Yeah, you got it.

06:24.976 --> 06:26.503
All right, listen up.

06:26.527 --> 06:28.089
I need all medical personnel
who's able to help.

06:28.113 --> 06:29.890
I need you to check everyone's ABCs.

06:29.914 --> 06:31.492
Airway, breathing, circulation.

06:31.516 --> 06:32.760
ABCs.

06:32.784 --> 06:34.394
Airway, breathing, circulation.

06:34.419 --> 06:36.097
Very good, Helm.
That's very good, all right?

06:36.121 --> 06:37.398
Just hold still for us, okay?

06:37.422 --> 06:39.266
Schmitt, I need you
to keep Simms on his side,

06:39.290 --> 06:41.181
- make sure he doesn't lose his airway.
- Lose his airway?

06:41.206 --> 06:42.381
From all the blood, yeah. Get over here.

06:42.405 --> 06:43.371
All right, put your hands on mine.

06:43.395 --> 06:45.635
All right, we're protecting
his c-spine no matter what.

06:45.659 --> 06:48.326
I'm gonna go find some packing
for his nose, stop this bleeding.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.740
I'm gonna go get some vodka to sterilize.

06:49.765 --> 06:50.820
Good call.

06:50.844 --> 06:53.556
My hips hurt. I think
I have a pelvic fracture.

06:53.580 --> 06:56.291
I think I have massive bleeding
inside my pelvis.

06:56.369 --> 06:57.547
I think I'm dying.

06:57.572 --> 07:00.439
No, no, no. You're not dying,
Helm. Sit tight.

07:02.074 --> 07:03.251
Was there a bomb?

07:03.356 --> 07:04.600
Who... Who manned the checkpoint?

07:04.624 --> 07:05.868
Are we in the Green Zone?

07:05.892 --> 07:08.070
Warren! Back door's blocked
from the outside.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.372
It's immobile.

07:09.396 --> 07:11.474
- I got it!
- Son! Wait!

07:16.970 --> 07:18.114
Aah!

07:20.038 --> 07:21.983
There's a large vehicle
blocking the door.

07:22.007 --> 07:23.284
You can't karate chop that away.

07:23.308 --> 07:24.719
It's Tae Kwon Do.

07:24.743 --> 07:26.220
- Either way.
- Yeah.

07:28.747 --> 07:30.525
All right, ma'am...

07:30.549 --> 07:31.959
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!

07:31.983 --> 07:33.747
Ma'am, ma'am, listen to me. Listen to me!

07:33.772 --> 07:35.116
- Tell me your name.
- Joan.

07:35.140 --> 07:36.618
My... My name is Joan.

07:36.642 --> 07:38.286
Okay, Joan. Joan, are you hurt?

07:38.310 --> 07:39.954
No, but my husband is dying.

07:39.978 --> 07:41.790
Okay, why do you think
your husband is dying, Joan?

07:41.814 --> 07:42.991
Help me help him.

07:43.015 --> 07:44.793
We were coming home from a party,

07:44.817 --> 07:47.462
and he started to gasp,
and then he grabbed his arm.

07:47.486 --> 07:49.197
Does he have a history of heart disease?

07:49.221 --> 07:50.799
He's had two heart attacks before.

07:50.823 --> 07:53.234
I just... I panicked, and
I-I was going to the hospital,

07:53.258 --> 07:55.470
and then someone was
in the road, and I swerved...

07:55.494 --> 07:56.810
- Joan, Joan, Joan, listen to...
- Oh, my God!

07:56.835 --> 07:58.204
- Listen to me. Listen to me.
- Oh, my God!

07:58.229 --> 08:00.240
I want you to try and take
his pulse. Can you do that?

08:00.264 --> 08:02.209
C-Can you reach over
and check his pulse for me?

08:02.233 --> 08:04.578
- Use two fingers under his jawbone.
- I don't... I don't...

08:04.602 --> 08:05.809
Move forward an inch, all right?

08:05.834 --> 08:06.851
- Can you do that?
- I don't know.

08:06.875 --> 08:08.248
- Does he have a pulse?
- No, I-I can't.

08:08.272 --> 08:11.537
- I can't. I don't know! I can't.
- O-O-Okay, okay, okay, okay.

08:11.562 --> 08:12.649
- I can't feel anything.
- Put your fingers

08:12.674 --> 08:13.840
under his nose, all right?

08:13.864 --> 08:15.642
- Feel for breath, okay?
- Okay.

08:15.666 --> 08:17.344
Now, can you do that?

08:17.368 --> 08:19.746
He... He's breathing.
He's breathing. He's breathing.

08:19.770 --> 08:21.042
- Okay. Okay. That's good.
- He's breathing.

08:21.067 --> 08:22.082
- That's good. That's good.
- He's breathing.

08:22.106 --> 08:23.550
- All right, now, Joan, sit tight.
- He's breathing.

08:23.574 --> 08:25.986
- Help is already on the way.
- Okay.

08:29.113 --> 08:30.090
Joe's.

08:30.154 --> 08:31.264
Man, I like that bar.

08:31.289 --> 08:32.866
It's gotta be chock full
of doctors and nurses.

08:32.892 --> 08:35.037
Maybe not. Late at night,
middle of the week.

08:35.062 --> 08:37.496
Do you think people don't drink
in the middle of the week?

08:39.945 --> 08:43.457
Ooh, a text from my hot doctor lover!

08:43.482 --> 08:45.361
You know, you don't have to call him
that every time you refer to him.

08:45.386 --> 08:47.197
Which one? Hot or doctor?

08:47.222 --> 08:48.533
- 'Cause he's both.
- "Lover."

08:48.558 --> 08:50.636
It's very 1978, and not in a good way.

08:50.661 --> 08:51.971
- Well, I'm bringing it back.
- Please don't.

08:51.996 --> 08:54.842
You know, what you could
call him is Jackson.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.912
Oh. I could call you Killjoy.

09:00.342 --> 09:01.486
- Hey, lover.
- Mm.

09:01.511 --> 09:02.688
Sorry, I'm on a call.

09:02.713 --> 09:04.391
Car plowed into Joe's bar.
Got to make it quick.

09:04.608 --> 09:05.941
Yeah, I'm in the bar.

09:06.784 --> 09:08.762
That's not funny. No, it's really not.

09:08.787 --> 09:11.032
Okay, well, I buried a man
I love not all that long ago,

09:11.057 --> 09:12.844
so catastrophe humor
isn't really my thing.

09:12.869 --> 09:14.480
And yet, I remain in the bar.

09:14.505 --> 09:16.149
- What? You're serious?
- What?

09:16.174 --> 09:17.985
- Are... Are you hurt?
- Why is he hurt?

09:18.010 --> 09:19.553
No, I'm not hurt, all right?

09:19.578 --> 09:21.456
It's just, the front door
is blocked by the car,

09:21.481 --> 09:23.993
and the back door is blocked
by something on the outside.

09:24.018 --> 09:25.115
Okay, you're in the bar? He's trapped.

09:25.140 --> 09:26.327
You're trapped in a burning bar?

09:26.351 --> 09:27.970
It's not burning, okay?
There's nothing burning.

09:27.995 --> 09:29.606
Well, not yet.
How bad is the car situation?

09:29.631 --> 09:31.609
You know what? I got to give you
to Warren. Here.

09:31.634 --> 09:32.811
Warren? Oh.

09:32.836 --> 09:34.681
Hey.

09:34.706 --> 09:35.950
There's no fire threat,

09:35.975 --> 09:37.486
but the structural integrity
of the front wall's

09:37.511 --> 09:39.222
been compromised,
and the rear exit's blocked.

09:39.247 --> 09:41.592
And we have, uh, six injured, some dire.

09:41.617 --> 09:43.461
Get here now.

09:45.656 --> 09:47.701
Hot doctor lover's trapped in Joe's bar?

09:47.726 --> 09:49.070
Shut up and drive.

10:03.510 --> 10:05.955
All right, I want this vehicle
to be secured and stabilized

10:05.979 --> 10:08.291
with cribbing and lifting straps
right now.

10:08.315 --> 10:10.827
Station 19 requests
two additional engines,

10:10.851 --> 10:12.595
two aid cars, and a USAR company.

10:12.619 --> 10:14.098
This wall is load-bearing.

10:14.122 --> 10:15.365
It's supporting the front of the bar.

10:15.389 --> 10:17.967
Several structural supports have
been sheared or compromised, sir.

10:17.991 --> 10:19.802
Captain, Ben Warren's on the inside.

10:19.826 --> 10:21.371
He said the back door's
blocked from the outside

10:21.395 --> 10:22.805
and there are multiple critical injuries.

10:22.829 --> 10:25.208
- Take Gibson and...
- Gibson, Hughes, let's assess.

10:49.556 --> 10:50.733
Surprise!

10:51.758 --> 10:53.669
What... What is this?

10:53.693 --> 10:56.038
Firehouse baby!

10:58.198 --> 10:59.442
Congratulations, Mama.

10:59.466 --> 11:01.010
T... Uh... No, Miller.

11:01.034 --> 11:02.578
- Okay, "Mommy"?
- Mnh-mnh.

11:02.602 --> 11:04.414
Congratulations, Miranda?

11:04.438 --> 11:06.215
Uh, my friends call me Bailey.

11:06.239 --> 11:07.650
Bailey! Congratulations, Bailey.

11:07.674 --> 11:09.552
Sparkling cider, Bailey?

11:09.576 --> 11:10.853
Oh, don't mind if I do.

11:12.879 --> 11:14.223
Uh, what's Avery doing here?

11:14.247 --> 11:16.426
Oh, uh, he's seeing Vic.

11:16.450 --> 11:17.960
Didn't her fiancé die?

11:17.984 --> 11:19.695
E-Everyone grieves in their own way.

11:19.719 --> 11:20.963
- Got it.
- Mm-hmm.

11:20.987 --> 11:25.168
I'd like to offer up a toast
to Ben and Miranda,

11:25.403 --> 11:28.081
already excellent parents to young Tuck.

11:28.105 --> 11:29.616
May this new blessing

11:29.640 --> 11:32.486
of an unexpected late-life baby...

11:32.510 --> 11:34.009
- Late life?
- Oh.

11:34.979 --> 11:36.189
Mid... life?

11:36.213 --> 11:38.291
J-Just move through it.
Just move through it.

11:38.315 --> 11:41.128
May this baby enrich your lives

11:41.152 --> 11:43.997
in ways you cannot yet imagine...

11:44.021 --> 11:45.265
but will always treasure.

11:45.289 --> 11:46.466
- Wow.
- Hear, hear.

11:46.490 --> 11:48.687
- Cheers.
- I brought it... I brought it around.

11:48.711 --> 11:50.478
Station 19 aid car.

11:50.503 --> 11:51.865
- You have to go?
- No, no, no. That one's me.

11:51.890 --> 11:52.973
Minor injury at residential home.

11:52.997 --> 11:54.608
- 52 Dudley Avenue.
- Wait. Oh, that's me, too.

11:54.632 --> 11:56.410
No, you stay with your date. I'll go.

11:56.434 --> 11:58.478
Montgomery.

11:58.502 --> 12:00.832
I'll take this one.

12:00.856 --> 12:03.995
You, uh... you enjoy the party.

12:04.020 --> 12:06.365
So, what, are those two a couple, or...?

12:06.390 --> 12:08.419
No, that... He's the Captain.

12:09.447 --> 12:10.590
Are you kidding?

12:10.614 --> 12:12.092
Construction all over the city.

12:12.116 --> 12:15.128
All they do is cut corners
and ignore fire codes.

12:20.825 --> 12:22.502
- Here. Hold me?
- Got you.

12:24.028 --> 12:26.006
We have a cement truck
blocking the back entrance.

12:26.030 --> 12:27.507
Gonna need a whole lot of backup.

12:27.531 --> 12:29.242
Ready?

12:29.266 --> 12:30.777
One, two...

12:36.073 --> 12:37.250
All right.

12:37.274 --> 12:38.985
Standing by for backup.

12:39.009 --> 12:40.987
Copy. Sending backup
and calling for a tow truck.

12:41.011 --> 12:42.289
Maybe the keys are in there somewhere.

12:42.313 --> 12:44.791
You think they left the keys
inside of the truck?

12:44.815 --> 12:47.394
They were stupid enough to park it in front
of a fire exit, so anything's possible.

12:47.418 --> 12:48.751
Unlock the other door.

12:55.253 --> 12:57.732
My hot doctor lover
is inside of that bar,

12:57.757 --> 12:59.668
and I would very much like
for his body to remain intact.

12:59.693 --> 13:02.111
A lot of people are inside that bar.

13:02.136 --> 13:04.208
Maybe I can hot-wire it.

13:04.233 --> 13:05.310
Are you judging me?

13:05.335 --> 13:06.779
- No.
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure you are.

13:06.804 --> 13:08.749
I'm pretty sure there was
some judgment in that tone.

13:08.774 --> 13:10.619
- Your fiancé died.
- Right.

13:10.644 --> 13:12.888
So, you think my vagina
should be a war widow

13:12.913 --> 13:14.091
draped in black forever?

13:14.116 --> 13:16.127
I'm not trying to judge you. I just...

13:16.152 --> 13:17.663
I don't get how you did it.

13:17.688 --> 13:19.254
- Did what?
- Moved on.

13:20.424 --> 13:23.203
Oh, you... You want to know the secret?

13:23.228 --> 13:25.640
Um, I don't know.
You feel it all the way.

13:25.665 --> 13:28.510
You cry, you wail, you write bad poems,

13:28.535 --> 13:30.046
and so sob so hard, you puke.

13:30.071 --> 13:33.250
You rage at the gods,
and you scream into your pillow,

13:33.275 --> 13:36.354
and you cry so hard,
your knees buckle under you,

13:36.379 --> 13:38.658
and you cry so hard, you think
your lungs are gonna collapse,

13:38.683 --> 13:40.293
and then something reminds you
of how funny he could be,

13:40.318 --> 13:41.529
so you start to laugh,

13:41.554 --> 13:43.265
and then you laugh so hard,
you need to cry some more.

13:43.290 --> 13:44.634
The secret is to let it out

13:44.659 --> 13:47.338
for as long and as often
as you feel like it.

13:47.363 --> 13:49.963
It's when you fight grief...
That's when it lingers.

13:51.448 --> 13:53.160
So, what are you grieving?

13:53.184 --> 13:54.394
I'm not grieving. No one died.

13:54.418 --> 13:55.629
Yeah, you know, no one had to.

13:55.653 --> 13:57.397
I know heartbreak when I see it, Herrera.

13:57.421 --> 13:58.832
- Someone hurt you bad.
- I can't get it.

13:58.856 --> 14:01.034
Just get out and get ready to push.

14:01.058 --> 14:03.804
Do you want me to ask my lover if
he's got any hot doctor friends?

14:03.828 --> 14:06.106
Let's go! Come on!

14:06.130 --> 14:07.307
Showtime.

14:07.331 --> 14:08.430
Hustle!

14:11.554 --> 14:13.065
All right, I need some guys here.

14:13.090 --> 14:15.502
You guys back here.
Bishop, Hughes... right here.

14:15.606 --> 14:17.117
You ready?

14:17.141 --> 14:19.386
One... two...

14:19.410 --> 14:20.475
three!

14:22.746 --> 14:25.013
Push, push!

14:27.351 --> 14:28.628
Push!

14:33.891 --> 14:35.862
All right, stop, stop. That's enough.

14:35.886 --> 14:37.396
Truck's too heavy.

14:37.420 --> 14:39.088
We need more hands back here.

14:39.112 --> 14:41.314
Herrera, Herrera, um...

14:41.339 --> 14:42.583
Your tongue's been in my mouth.

14:42.607 --> 14:45.018
I think that puts us
on a first-name basis.

14:45.042 --> 14:47.654
Look, Andy, I didn't mean
to hurt you, okay?

14:47.678 --> 14:48.889
And I would like it if...

14:49.184 --> 14:50.895
Hasn't it been long enough?

14:50.920 --> 14:52.131
Can't we be friends?

14:52.155 --> 14:53.966
Wow.

14:53.990 --> 14:56.001
Look, a-a relationship
between us is against the rules.

14:56.025 --> 14:57.770
Yeah, I understand the rules, Robert,

14:57.794 --> 15:00.100
- but you broke a lot of them.
- I know.

15:00.125 --> 15:01.465
You know, it's not just against the rules

15:01.489 --> 15:02.803
to have sex with your subordinates.

15:02.827 --> 15:05.710
It's also against the rules
to throw them longing glances.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.198
- Andy...
- It's against the rules

15:07.223 --> 15:08.684
to let your hands linger,

15:08.708 --> 15:09.718
to let your eyes wander...

15:09.742 --> 15:11.186
Oh, y-you're saying I harassed you?

15:11.210 --> 15:12.721
No, I'm saying you fell in love with me,

15:13.135 --> 15:15.480
which is also specifically
against the rules.

15:15.504 --> 15:17.349
I'm saying I fell in love with you

15:17.373 --> 15:19.373
and you did nothing to discourage it.

15:25.414 --> 15:26.792
I never took advantage.

15:26.816 --> 15:28.360
I didn't say you took advantage.

15:28.384 --> 15:29.528
- I s...
- Hep!

15:30.553 --> 15:34.132
I am saying I wasn't the only one.

15:34.156 --> 15:37.102
And I kissed you, but we both felt it.

15:37.544 --> 15:40.690
And then... And then you...
You... you say it can't happen,

15:40.714 --> 15:43.392
you... you don't speak to me
for weeks, you push me away.

15:43.416 --> 15:45.127
- I mean, that's crazy-making.
- Okay.

15:45.151 --> 15:46.495
It's... It's... It's gaslighting!

15:46.519 --> 15:49.465
I'm sorry. I didn't know
how to handle it. I...

15:49.489 --> 15:51.400
Just admit that you felt it, too.

15:52.027 --> 15:54.472
Admit that...
That I'm not making this up,

15:54.496 --> 15:56.308
that this isn't a figment
of my imagination.

15:56.332 --> 15:57.664
Okay, you're not making it up.

16:01.403 --> 16:02.769
And it can't happen.

16:04.373 --> 16:06.117
Both of those things are true.

16:13.883 --> 16:15.048
Okay.

16:16.392 --> 16:18.370
Let's get rid of the back window
and cut the seep holes.

16:18.395 --> 16:19.672
We weaken the roof of that car, sir,

16:19.696 --> 16:21.007
and the whole wall may collapse.

16:21.031 --> 16:22.709
Let's get the struts in place
so we can shore above the car.

16:22.733 --> 16:25.678
Help! He's not breathing!

16:25.702 --> 16:27.146
- He's not breathing!
- Go, go, go, go, go.

16:27.170 --> 16:28.881
Please help!

16:28.905 --> 16:30.539
He's not breathing!

16:30.564 --> 16:32.175
He's dying!!

16:32.199 --> 16:33.477
He's not breathing!

16:33.501 --> 16:35.378
Don, please don't die on me.

16:35.402 --> 16:36.780
Okay, Joan. Joan. Joan! Joan.

16:36.804 --> 16:38.715
I need you to do CPR, okay?

16:38.739 --> 16:40.928
Now, press on his chest hard, all right?

16:40.953 --> 16:42.464
To the tune of "Stayin' Alive."

16:42.488 --> 16:45.233
- Just one, two, three, four.
- Okay.

16:45.257 --> 16:48.203
One, two, three, four, staying alive.

16:48.227 --> 16:50.805
- One, two, three, four. There you go.
- Staying alive, staying alive.

16:50.829 --> 16:53.041
- You got some kind of hammer back there?
- Yeah.

16:53.065 --> 16:54.542
Bring it... And a bar towel.

16:54.566 --> 16:57.412
One, two, three, four.

16:57.436 --> 16:59.640
Okay, I need you to hold this stool.
Can you do that?

16:59.665 --> 17:00.775
Yes, sir. No, no, no, I'll get it.

17:00.799 --> 17:01.943
Let the guy without the medical license

17:01.967 --> 17:03.511
hold the damn stool, Warren.

17:03.535 --> 17:05.246
Come on. One, two, three, four.

17:05.270 --> 17:07.080
One, two, three, four.

17:09.040 --> 17:11.319
Sullivan!

17:11.343 --> 17:12.654
- Herrera?
- Sullivan, down here!

17:12.678 --> 17:14.923
Herrera? Get away from this
window. This wall is not stable.

17:14.946 --> 17:16.324
We have access to the victims.

17:16.348 --> 17:18.259
Passenger's in cardiac arrest.
We need the LIFEPAK.

17:18.282 --> 17:19.460
LIFEPAK. LIFEPAK!

17:19.483 --> 17:20.828
Yeah, I got multiple injuries
over here, too.

17:20.852 --> 17:23.164
- Uh, Kim?
- Got it.

17:23.827 --> 17:26.673
We need packing and tape,
all the supplies you got, Sullivan.

17:26.696 --> 17:29.809
- ...two, three, four.
- Keep coming!

17:29.833 --> 17:30.977
We're securing the vehicle on our end.

17:31.001 --> 17:32.545
You do your best
to stabilize it on yours.

17:32.569 --> 17:34.077
See if you can stack
some kegs or something.

17:34.102 --> 17:35.077
Copy.

17:35.101 --> 17:36.849
Joan, I need you to take these pads.

17:36.873 --> 17:39.552
- ...staying alive, staying alive...
- Joan, can you hear me?

17:39.576 --> 17:40.954
Joan! Please stop singing!

17:40.978 --> 17:42.722
All right, listen to me.

17:42.746 --> 17:46.993
Open your husband's shirt
and put these pads on his chest.

17:47.017 --> 17:48.828
- Okay?
- Okay.

17:48.852 --> 17:52.012
- One is going high on his right...
- Oh, okay.

17:52.036 --> 17:54.781
...and low and to the side on his left.

17:54.805 --> 17:55.808
Okay.

17:55.832 --> 17:57.370
High...

17:57.787 --> 17:59.365
- You're doing great.
- O-Okay, okay.

17:59.389 --> 18:01.100
Are you good? All right,
now take your hands away from him, Joan.

18:01.124 --> 18:03.469
Okay, move all the way away
from him so I can shock him.

18:03.493 --> 18:05.337
Okay, wait, wait. Will it hurt him?

18:05.361 --> 18:06.358
- No.
- Okay.

18:06.382 --> 18:07.573
He's in V-tach. Okay.

18:07.597 --> 18:09.742
Here we go.

18:09.766 --> 18:11.010
Clear!

18:12.368 --> 18:13.812
Okay, one more time.

18:13.836 --> 18:15.879
All right, clear!

18:18.174 --> 18:19.985
Ow!

18:20.009 --> 18:21.555
Mother of God!

18:21.579 --> 18:22.855
What are you doing to me?!

18:22.879 --> 18:24.530
You said he wouldn't feel it.

18:24.554 --> 18:25.658
Be glad he could.

18:30.735 --> 18:32.631
- Okay, your turn.
- Yeah. Here we go.

18:32.656 --> 18:33.631
I got it this time.

18:33.655 --> 18:37.246
I wish your baby a mountain of charm,

18:37.270 --> 18:39.381
because charm will get you through

18:39.405 --> 18:41.083
just about anything in this life.

18:41.107 --> 18:42.518
Even criminal charges.

18:42.542 --> 18:44.520
That is true.

18:44.544 --> 18:45.754
Criminal charges?

18:45.778 --> 18:47.156
Yeah, he was defending my honor.

18:47.180 --> 18:48.324
- You okay?
- Fine.

18:48.348 --> 18:51.427
Uh, I wish your baby...

18:51.451 --> 18:53.262
courage, vulnerability...

18:53.286 --> 18:54.563
You're supposed to only pick one.

18:54.587 --> 18:56.619
Okay. Great. Thank you.

18:57.223 --> 19:00.814
I wish your baby more ups
in this life than downs.

19:00.839 --> 19:01.963
Hey.

19:02.095 --> 19:05.745
I wish your baby her mother's smarts.

19:05.770 --> 19:07.348
I wish that, too.

19:07.372 --> 19:08.882
Her?

19:08.906 --> 19:10.617
Oh, yeah. 50 bucks says she's a girl.

19:10.641 --> 19:12.920
I'll take those...

19:12.944 --> 19:17.925
Um, well, I wish your baby
a long, long and healthy life.

19:17.949 --> 19:19.326
Thanks.

19:19.350 --> 19:20.661
Thanks, man.

19:20.685 --> 19:22.529
And I wish your baby a happy family

19:22.553 --> 19:24.365
for her whole life.

19:25.390 --> 19:27.156
Andy, your turn.

19:28.493 --> 19:30.404
I wish...

19:30.428 --> 19:32.306
I wish your baby love.

19:33.376 --> 19:35.054
- Aww!
- Mm.

19:35.078 --> 19:36.288
- Love.
- Cheers to that.

19:36.312 --> 19:37.389
- Love.
- Cheers to that.

19:37.413 --> 19:38.757
- Cheers to love.
- Cheers to love.

19:38.781 --> 19:40.325
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

19:40.349 --> 19:41.860
I'm gonna go wash up.

19:45.822 --> 19:47.533
You died, Don.

19:47.557 --> 19:49.268
You died on me!

19:49.292 --> 19:50.402
You stopped breathing!

19:50.426 --> 19:52.204
I didn't do it on purpose!

19:52.228 --> 19:54.073
You stopped breathing,
and all I could think about

19:54.097 --> 19:56.108
was going home without you and the dog!

19:56.132 --> 19:58.343
God, all I could think about
was the look on her face

19:58.367 --> 19:59.711
when I would come home without you.

19:59.735 --> 20:03.615
If you die, Cleo will crap
on the floor every day after.

20:03.639 --> 20:05.751
Every day of my life after you die

20:05.775 --> 20:07.453
will be crap on the floor!

20:07.477 --> 20:10.522
Literal crap and figurative crap!

20:10.918 --> 20:12.996
So just don't do it!

20:13.020 --> 20:14.298
Don't die on me!

20:14.322 --> 20:16.800
I-I don't want to do this life
without you.

20:16.824 --> 20:18.429
Okay.

20:18.453 --> 20:20.904
Me neither, okay?

20:20.928 --> 20:22.570
B-Breathe, Joan.

20:22.601 --> 20:24.885
Don't tell me to breathe. You breathe.

20:27.202 --> 20:28.613
All right, Helm, I'm ready. You ready?

20:28.637 --> 20:30.115
What are you gonna do?

20:30.139 --> 20:31.516
We're gonna set this leg.

20:31.540 --> 20:32.851
Was there a bomb?

20:32.875 --> 20:35.197
Where are we? We should get out of here.

20:35.222 --> 20:36.800
Is he in shock, or is his brain bleeding?

20:36.824 --> 20:38.535
Take a look. All right.

20:38.559 --> 20:39.925
All right, sit still.

20:39.949 --> 20:42.105
Pupils look equal and reactive.

20:42.129 --> 20:43.840
Let me check.

20:43.864 --> 20:44.941
I got a small hematoma.

20:44.965 --> 20:46.376
I just need you to lay down,
Parker, okay?

20:46.400 --> 20:47.944
Just wait till help comes. Lay down.

20:47.968 --> 20:50.280
All right, Helm,
let's get you set up here.

20:50.304 --> 20:51.982
Little bit of morphine,
we'll get started.

20:52.006 --> 20:53.614
But I'm allergic to morphine!

20:53.638 --> 20:55.018
Okay. All right. Um...

20:55.042 --> 20:57.487
All right, uh, Trey, give me,
uh, couple shots of whiskey.

20:57.511 --> 20:58.519
Are you serious?

20:58.544 --> 20:59.961
Yeah, I'm serious. You got a better idea?

20:59.985 --> 21:01.744
Warren, I could use your help here.

21:02.558 --> 21:04.620
- Who's the whiskey for?
- Right here. I got a broken leg.

21:04.644 --> 21:06.452
Helm, I need you to drink up,
all right? None for Parker.

21:06.476 --> 21:08.407
Everything hurts.

21:08.431 --> 21:09.608
Am I dying?

21:09.632 --> 21:12.548
- Not today.
- Is this what dying feels like?

21:12.573 --> 21:14.285
Simms is dying. You're not dying.

21:14.309 --> 21:15.619
Simms is not dying! No one's dying!

21:15.643 --> 21:17.488
Casey also might be dying. Hard to tell.

21:17.512 --> 21:18.936
Hey! No one is dying!

21:18.960 --> 21:20.691
- You don't know that.
- Was there a bomb?

21:20.715 --> 21:22.443
- Where are we?
- Parker, lay down.

21:22.467 --> 21:23.414
Are we setting this leg?

21:23.439 --> 21:24.773
I'll provide traction. You set the bone.

21:24.797 --> 21:25.958
We got to get out of here.

21:25.982 --> 21:28.151
We... We... We... We got to get
out of here before it collapses.

21:28.175 --> 21:29.621
Your wife is having a baby.

21:29.645 --> 21:30.768
She's not.

21:30.792 --> 21:33.350
- What?
- What do you mean?

21:33.375 --> 21:35.537
She's not having a baby anymore.

21:35.561 --> 21:37.605
Look, just... Just hold still.

21:37.629 --> 21:41.525
Here we go. On my count. One, two, three.

21:44.336 --> 21:46.831
Come in! Come on, hustle!

21:47.578 --> 21:49.756
Right here. Some in the back.

21:49.780 --> 21:50.957
Ready?

21:50.981 --> 21:53.426
And... go.

21:53.450 --> 21:55.361
- Push!
- Come on!

21:55.385 --> 21:57.662
- That's right! We got this! Go, go, go!
- Hold it! Hold it!

21:59.323 --> 22:00.701
Oh, no, no, no. Not right now.

22:02.493 --> 22:04.972
Stop pushing, Gibson.
I have a motor vehicle at 12:00.

22:04.996 --> 22:07.115
- Stop pushing. Stop pushing.
- Back up!

22:07.139 --> 22:08.541
Back up!

22:08.565 --> 22:09.771
Back door is almost clear,

22:09.795 --> 22:12.254
but I am now blocked by your tow truck,

22:12.279 --> 22:13.590
and I still don't see any aid cars.

22:13.614 --> 22:15.225
Copy, Herrera. Aid cars en route.

22:15.249 --> 22:16.359
Use the tow truck.

22:16.389 --> 22:19.010
No, it'll take longer.
Get it out of my way.

22:19.035 --> 22:20.712
Stop! Pull forward!

22:20.736 --> 22:22.681
You do this all the time, huh?

22:22.705 --> 22:24.783
- Hm?
- You and Vic.

22:24.807 --> 22:29.922
This job is just basically
like this all the time?

22:29.946 --> 22:31.690
Yeah. I guess it is.

22:31.714 --> 22:33.992
I don't know how the hell
you guys do it, honestly.

22:34.016 --> 22:37.010
You know, the adrenaline pumps
while you're in it.

22:37.035 --> 22:38.245
Gets you through.

22:38.269 --> 22:40.948
It's actually pretty thrilling
a fair amount of the time.

22:40.972 --> 22:42.153
But sometimes I get scared

22:42.178 --> 22:43.517
- after the fact.
- After?

22:43.541 --> 22:45.686
Yeah, you know, like,
after all the danger's passed,

22:45.710 --> 22:47.855
sometimes I start thinking,
"That was insane.

22:47.879 --> 22:49.890
We just ran toward the fire.

22:49.914 --> 22:51.292
Who does that?"

22:51.316 --> 22:53.627
And then I start thinking,
"What if I died?

22:53.651 --> 22:56.197
You know, what would... Would Miranda do?

22:56.221 --> 22:57.464
What about Tuck?

22:57.488 --> 22:58.866
What about the ba..."

23:02.994 --> 23:06.173
Guess I don't have to worry
so much about that part anymore.

23:06.197 --> 23:08.676
I'm really sorry about that, man.

23:08.700 --> 23:10.344
Yeah. Me, too.

23:10.368 --> 23:12.743
He's choking again!

23:12.768 --> 23:13.912
And turning blue!

23:13.936 --> 23:15.694
- Okay, we're gonna have to crike him.
- Yep.

23:16.739 --> 23:18.967
He's dying! I told you he was dying!

23:18.991 --> 23:22.167
Helm, you're inebriated
and possibly brain-damaged.

23:22.192 --> 23:23.903
These are excellent reasons
for you to shut up!

23:23.927 --> 23:25.838
- Okay, I'm gonna need a 16-gauge needle.
- Yep.

23:25.862 --> 23:27.973
Find another pair of gloves.

23:32.802 --> 23:34.235
Excuse me.

23:36.838 --> 23:38.070
Miller?

23:39.443 --> 23:40.820
Hey.

23:40.844 --> 23:42.054
Uh, is Ben with you?

23:42.078 --> 23:43.589
I've been calling him.
He's not answering.

23:43.613 --> 23:45.691
Uh, yeah, he's inside.

23:46.136 --> 23:47.480
But he's not working.

23:47.504 --> 23:48.715
No, he wasn't.

23:48.739 --> 23:49.749
But... I got to go.

23:49.773 --> 23:51.317
Sorry.

23:51.341 --> 23:52.952
He was in the bar?

23:52.976 --> 23:54.654
When the car drove into it?!

23:54.678 --> 23:56.022
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

23:56.046 --> 23:57.290
Get back behind the line!

23:57.314 --> 23:59.031
Dean Miller, get your hands off me!

23:59.055 --> 24:01.463
Okay, but you have to get back
behind the lines, Bailey.

24:01.487 --> 24:03.206
Was my husband in that bar? Is he hurt?

24:03.231 --> 24:04.441
No, I do not believe he's hurt.

24:04.465 --> 24:05.831
Okay, is he in danger?

24:06.834 --> 24:08.812
- You... You paused. You paused.
- Okay...

24:08.836 --> 24:09.980
- Miller.
- Hey, hey!

24:10.004 --> 24:11.148
Look, we're moving as fast as we can

24:11.172 --> 24:12.861
to get Ben and everybody else
out of that bar.

24:12.886 --> 24:14.297
Okay, well, who else is in there?

24:14.321 --> 24:16.800
Are doctors in there? Nurses?
Are my people hurt?

24:16.824 --> 24:17.967
Yeah, yeah, people are hurt,

24:17.991 --> 24:20.103
but you have to let me do my job
and help them.

24:20.127 --> 24:21.755
Miller, I am Chief of Surgery...

24:21.779 --> 24:24.174
Dr. Bailey, you are not my chief.

24:24.588 --> 24:26.632
Okay? My Captain is standing right there.

24:26.656 --> 24:27.900
He gave me orders,

24:27.924 --> 24:30.069
orders I can't carry out because
you're getting in my way,

24:30.093 --> 24:31.270
and you're costing me time, Bailey.

24:31.294 --> 24:32.371
You're costing me time.

24:32.395 --> 24:33.973
What if I walked into your O.R.,

24:33.997 --> 24:36.231
got in your way, and cost you time?

24:42.973 --> 24:44.584
Thank you.

24:44.608 --> 24:46.219
Get my husband out of there!

24:46.243 --> 24:47.469
Yes, ma'am!

24:50.680 --> 24:54.185
I see why you like this place so much.

24:54.210 --> 24:55.910
Mm-hmm.

24:57.262 --> 24:58.839
Do you think Dean was right?

24:58.863 --> 25:00.797
You think it's a girl?

25:02.546 --> 25:04.279
I kinda do.

25:08.145 --> 25:10.145
I always wanted a girl.

25:14.045 --> 25:15.456
Mm.

25:15.480 --> 25:16.891
I like it up here.

25:16.915 --> 25:20.294
I feel... safe up here.

25:21.351 --> 25:25.341
This world feels dark sometimes.

25:26.228 --> 25:32.181
Bringing a brand-new human being
onto this planet...

25:34.077 --> 25:36.936
I like knowing
there are heroes out there.

25:40.343 --> 25:43.210
I like knowing the heroes personally.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.972
I like that a lot.

25:48.998 --> 25:50.497
Mm.

26:08.743 --> 26:11.462
Okay, sir, I need to get you out of here.

26:11.487 --> 26:13.665
Please, take my wife out first.

26:13.689 --> 26:15.267
Don, you just died a minute ago.

26:15.291 --> 26:16.468
I barely died.

26:16.492 --> 26:18.570
Will you let the man help you,
for God's sakes?

26:18.594 --> 26:20.361
Okay. Fine.

26:23.065 --> 26:25.577
I'm gonna put this in your lap.

26:25.601 --> 26:28.580
Let me move your head, okay?

26:28.604 --> 26:29.948
Just like that. Perfect.

26:29.972 --> 26:31.683
I'm gonna let your seat down.

26:31.707 --> 26:32.785
I'm ready.

26:32.809 --> 26:33.852
Come on, hurry up. Hurry up.

26:37.814 --> 26:39.625
Slowly back.

26:39.649 --> 26:41.093
All right.

26:42.652 --> 26:44.696
One, two, three.

26:44.720 --> 26:48.233
Okay, Joan, I'm gonna hold you upright

26:48.257 --> 26:49.535
while I put your seat back.

26:49.559 --> 26:51.635
Can you undo your seatbelt for me?

26:52.962 --> 26:54.982
- Um...
- Can you undo your seatbelt, please?

26:55.007 --> 26:56.985
You know, if he dies,
the dog is never gonna recover.

26:57.009 --> 26:58.887
Okay, Joan, let's focus
on keeping you both alive.

26:58.911 --> 27:00.121
Is your seatbelt stuck?

27:00.145 --> 27:01.389
Uh, y-yeah.

27:01.413 --> 27:03.124
But you know what? I-I-It's okay.

27:03.148 --> 27:05.460
I've got my...
I've got my crafting scissors.

27:05.484 --> 27:07.362
I mean, he's not gonna die, is he?

27:07.386 --> 27:08.763
I mean, he's only 53.

27:08.787 --> 27:10.932
Okay, I've got them.

27:10.956 --> 27:13.568
Okay, Dean, I'm gonna need the
safety cutters for this seatbelt.

27:21.277 --> 27:23.022
Montgomery!
Montgomery, are you all right?

27:23.046 --> 27:24.246
I'm okay, I'm okay.

27:24.273 --> 27:25.383
Joan?

27:25.407 --> 27:27.418
- Can you get the door?
- I'm on it.

27:27.442 --> 27:28.586
Hey, Joan?

27:28.610 --> 27:30.522
Hey, Joan... Joan?

27:30.546 --> 27:32.557
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

27:32.581 --> 27:34.292
Get the door! Get her out of here!

27:34.316 --> 27:35.560
Help me get her out of here!

27:35.584 --> 27:37.996
- It's in her carotid.
- I need pressure pads over here!

27:38.020 --> 27:40.031
We need to brace this header.

27:40.275 --> 27:42.108
Let's get some shoring now. Now! Come on!

27:42.133 --> 27:43.577
Raker's on the way, sir.

27:43.601 --> 27:45.367
Montgomery, give me an update.

27:46.337 --> 27:47.848
Montgomery?

27:47.872 --> 27:49.290
Herrera,

27:49.315 --> 27:50.497
I need a report on the back door.

27:50.521 --> 27:52.386
How many minutes out?

27:52.410 --> 27:54.690
- Come on! Let's go!
- We're almost there.

27:54.715 --> 27:56.893
One minute out.

27:58.552 --> 28:00.630
Firehouse baby!

28:20.359 --> 28:21.692
I'm sorry.

28:30.109 --> 28:32.966
If Ripley were still here...

28:34.153 --> 28:35.939
I think he might tell you...

28:36.615 --> 28:38.475
to screw the rules.

28:50.810 --> 28:52.589
They're making me Battalion Chief.

28:54.878 --> 28:57.390
A-And I want you to make Captain, but...

28:58.011 --> 29:00.448
it's not gonna happen if we're together.

29:02.385 --> 29:03.896
Why not?

29:04.393 --> 29:06.752
H-Haven't I earned it?

29:06.777 --> 29:08.788
People won't see it that way.

29:08.812 --> 29:10.156
So we can't be together

29:10.180 --> 29:12.147
because I won't get my promotion?

29:14.290 --> 29:15.523
Right.

29:16.954 --> 29:20.300
Or we can't be together
because if people find out,

29:20.324 --> 29:22.452
you won't get your promotion?

29:28.999 --> 29:30.410
Right.

29:41.533 --> 29:43.978
- Got it! I got it!
- We're in!

29:49.288 --> 29:50.666
Jackson?

29:50.690 --> 29:52.101
Yeah, Vic, over here!

29:52.125 --> 29:53.335
All right, attention!

29:53.359 --> 29:55.437
- I'm fine.
- This is Seattle Fire Department.

29:55.461 --> 29:57.239
Anyone who can walk,
I need you to make your way

29:57.263 --> 29:59.108
up these stairs and out
the back entrance, all right?

29:59.132 --> 30:00.909
- Let's go.
- Over here. Follow me.

30:08.775 --> 30:11.220
Roll on three. One, two, three.

30:21.871 --> 30:24.082
He has complex max-face fractures,

30:24.107 --> 30:26.352
and he almost lost his airway
twice before we criked him.

30:26.377 --> 30:28.188
Get him to Grey-Sloan. He's one of ours.

30:30.083 --> 30:31.616
Parker, can you walk?

30:34.219 --> 30:35.396
Levi, let's go.

30:35.420 --> 30:37.965
I don't want to die.
I'm supposed to be a surgeon.

30:37.989 --> 30:40.701
I'm supposed to save all the lives.

30:40.725 --> 30:42.270
Hey, Helm, you're not dying,
okay? You're just drunk.

30:42.294 --> 30:44.171
In all fairness, she also might be dying!

30:44.195 --> 30:46.173
- We don't know!
- Schmitt, you can't help her here, okay?

30:46.197 --> 30:48.898
Go scrub in. We need all hands
on deck back at the hospital.

30:53.772 --> 30:55.750
Dad?

30:55.774 --> 30:57.552
Dad, what the hell are you doing in here?

30:57.576 --> 30:59.520
Well, I was drinking. Now I'm helping.

30:59.544 --> 31:01.923
Why were you drinking at a hospital bar

31:01.947 --> 31:03.345
at this time of night?

31:04.783 --> 31:06.749
Anything I should know?

31:09.254 --> 31:11.265
Took you a long time to get in here.

31:11.802 --> 31:13.723
Your unit's gone soft.

31:48.255 --> 31:49.532
- You okay?
- Hey. Yeah.

31:49.556 --> 31:52.402
Um, I'm gonna head back to work,
see if I can help.

31:52.426 --> 31:53.937
Yeah, of course.

31:53.961 --> 31:55.372
- You look, um...
- Filthy.

31:55.396 --> 31:57.140
- Yeah, I know. I also stink.
- Hot.

31:57.164 --> 31:58.475
Actually, you look hot.

31:58.932 --> 32:00.041
Yeah?

32:00.065 --> 32:01.944
You like soot? Soot's your thing?

32:01.968 --> 32:04.280
Apparently, soot's one of my things now.

32:18.451 --> 32:19.662
Shh, shh.

32:20.214 --> 32:21.725
You're okay. Yeah, I'm okay.

32:21.749 --> 32:23.860
I'm okay.

32:29.490 --> 32:31.668
It's my fault.

32:31.692 --> 32:33.837
If I'd made it into Medic One...

32:33.861 --> 32:35.205
Wait, w-what?

32:35.229 --> 32:37.607
M-M-My job is too stressful
for you. All right?

32:37.631 --> 32:39.676
You were too scared. I-It's my fault.

32:39.700 --> 32:41.711
Ben, no!

32:41.735 --> 32:43.307
This was not your fault.

32:43.331 --> 32:45.772
This was not anybody's fault.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.817
Or... maybe it's God's fault,

32:47.841 --> 32:49.946
okay, if you want somebody to blame.

32:49.970 --> 32:52.485
Yeah, your job scares me to death,

32:52.509 --> 32:55.091
but you weren't even at work
tonight, and look what happened,

32:55.115 --> 32:56.972
so...

32:57.975 --> 32:59.520
Life.

33:04.441 --> 33:07.119
It scares me to death sometimes.

33:07.143 --> 33:08.721
Yeah, okay.

33:08.745 --> 33:11.857
W-We're okay. We're okay.

33:15.251 --> 33:18.097
Ohh. I have to go back to work.

33:18.121 --> 33:19.546
Yeah, I know.

33:19.570 --> 33:21.833
I know.

33:23.293 --> 33:26.129
Miranda, y-your residents...

33:26.730 --> 33:29.324
Okay, how bad is it?

33:31.092 --> 33:32.703
I'll walk with you.

33:45.884 --> 33:47.595
All right, let's do
our last inventory check

33:47.619 --> 33:48.963
and get out of here.

33:57.094 --> 33:59.406
You're calling me a slut?

33:59.430 --> 34:01.141
I am just asking you

34:01.165 --> 34:04.077
why you can't stop crapping
where you eat.

34:04.101 --> 34:05.872
You're calling me a slut.

34:05.896 --> 34:07.338
Every time you make the decision

34:07.362 --> 34:08.422
to sleep with a firefighter
in your own station,

34:08.447 --> 34:09.545
I didn't sleep with him, and if I had,

34:09.569 --> 34:10.949
it's none of your business.
You set back female

34:10.974 --> 34:12.137
firefighters a few years!

34:12.161 --> 34:14.690
Dad, you need to stop talking now.

34:14.714 --> 34:16.909
I don't care how many men
you sleep with, Andy...

34:16.934 --> 34:18.344
- Stop talking.
- ...but your Captain?!

34:18.368 --> 34:19.846
I didn't sleep with him, and if I had,

34:19.870 --> 34:21.214
it's still none of your business!

34:21.237 --> 34:24.105
It damn well is my business!
You are my child!

34:25.875 --> 34:28.976
Your decisions reflect on me,
on my legacy!

34:36.938 --> 34:38.272
Get out.

34:41.257 --> 34:44.824
Andrea, I am your father.

34:46.167 --> 34:49.679
You may not have any respect
for rules, for tradition,

34:49.704 --> 34:51.114
for authority,

34:51.139 --> 34:54.018
but you will respect your father.

34:54.534 --> 34:55.775
Got it, Dad.

34:57.287 --> 34:58.856
Then I'll get out.

34:59.620 --> 35:01.153
Andrea.

35:03.530 --> 35:04.596
Andrea!

35:11.094 --> 35:14.908
Captain Herrera, it's late.

35:16.223 --> 35:17.811
U-Uh...

35:17.835 --> 35:19.534
Sorry to wake you.

35:22.372 --> 35:24.206
Are you okay?

35:25.582 --> 35:27.393
Because we haven't talked
since that night with your dad,

35:27.417 --> 35:28.494
and you don't seem okay.

35:28.518 --> 35:29.628
I didn't sleep with Sullivan.

35:29.652 --> 35:31.197
There's tension between the two of you.

35:31.221 --> 35:32.698
Everyone feels it.

35:32.722 --> 35:33.899
I didn't sleep with him.

35:33.923 --> 35:36.202
Andy, I honestly don't care
who you sleep with.

35:36.226 --> 35:38.192
I care that you won't talk to me.

35:44.934 --> 35:47.780
They're about to name a new Fire Chief,

35:48.303 --> 35:51.082
and Sullivan wants Battalion Chief,

35:51.107 --> 35:52.517
and he wants to make me Captain.

35:52.541 --> 35:54.386
He says if we have a relationship,

35:54.410 --> 35:57.022
it messes with our promotions.

35:57.046 --> 35:59.157
He says he's protecting me.

36:02.218 --> 36:04.318
I didn't sleep with him.

36:06.756 --> 36:08.021
Okay.

36:11.494 --> 36:13.238
Thank you.

36:24.647 --> 36:26.057
He's in heart surgery.

36:26.081 --> 36:28.259
- It is not your fault.
- He's in heart surgery.

36:28.283 --> 36:29.894
When he comes out,

36:29.918 --> 36:32.564
he's gonna learn that his wife,
who was perfectly healthy...

36:32.588 --> 36:33.706
You don't know she was perfectly healthy.

36:33.731 --> 36:34.875
She was perfectly healthy.

36:34.899 --> 36:36.094
Well, she drove her car into a bar.

36:36.118 --> 36:37.769
She swerved while she was trying
to get her husband to the hospital.

36:37.793 --> 36:39.371
Yeah, maybe she had an aneurysm
waiting to rupture.

36:39.395 --> 36:40.993
Maybe she would have died tomorrow...

36:41.017 --> 36:42.293
Vic, just let me say it. ...and you...

36:42.317 --> 36:43.553
Just let me say it.

36:43.577 --> 36:45.687
I should've taken away those scissors.

36:45.711 --> 36:48.580
I was right there,
and I almost had her out.

36:48.873 --> 36:49.982
I just...

36:51.175 --> 36:53.921
Every time I try to believe
that there's some justice,

36:53.945 --> 36:58.025
some grand plan, life proves me wrong.

37:01.715 --> 37:03.626
I almost had her out.

37:09.204 --> 37:11.349
Why are you crying?

37:11.373 --> 37:12.917
It just happens sometimes.

37:12.941 --> 37:15.086
I highly recommend it.

37:18.881 --> 37:21.659
They have a dog.

37:21.683 --> 37:25.752
She was... talking about her dog.

37:27.322 --> 37:28.510
Address?

39:04.609 --> 39:05.909
You did great work today.

39:06.805 --> 39:08.938
I do great work every day.

39:11.588 --> 39:12.854
Insubordination.

39:13.542 --> 39:14.662
Excuse me?

39:14.686 --> 39:15.863
I've been patient,

39:15.887 --> 39:18.366
but I've had just about enough
of the insubordination.

39:18.390 --> 39:20.668
It affects morale.

39:20.692 --> 39:22.570
Your friends, they follow your lead.

39:22.594 --> 39:23.805
Friends?

39:23.829 --> 39:25.273
What friends?

39:25.297 --> 39:27.938
Friendships only function
if you can talk to your friends

39:27.963 --> 39:29.074
about what you're going through,

39:29.099 --> 39:30.643
and I'm so busy
protecting your promotion...

39:30.667 --> 39:31.733
Take a week off.

39:32.902 --> 39:34.046
You're benching me?

39:34.070 --> 39:35.248
I'm not benching you.

39:35.272 --> 39:37.383
I won't put it on your record.

39:37.407 --> 39:39.252
I'm saying take some personal days,

39:39.276 --> 39:41.287
get your head together, and figure out

39:41.311 --> 39:43.556
how to at least pretend
like you respect me.

39:43.580 --> 39:45.825
You could transfer to another station.

39:45.849 --> 39:47.893
You could be Captain but not be my boss.

39:47.917 --> 39:49.929
You could trust that I will be
promoted to Captain

39:49.953 --> 39:51.697
in due course because I have earned it.

39:51.721 --> 39:53.666
You could trust that I don't
need any favors from you,

39:53.690 --> 39:55.980
and I don't need your
patronizing idea of protection,

39:56.004 --> 39:57.626
because I get enough of that
from my father.

39:57.650 --> 39:58.793
Yeah, this conversation is over.

40:00.565 --> 40:03.277
You finish your shift and...

40:03.301 --> 40:04.801
take the week off.

40:28.301 --> 40:29.879
We should try and get some sleep.

40:29.903 --> 40:31.287
We need to talk.

40:32.639 --> 40:35.273
I think it's time for us to stop.

40:37.110 --> 40:38.187
Stop what?

40:38.211 --> 40:39.722
This. Us.

40:50.703 --> 40:51.914
Did I do something or...

40:51.938 --> 40:52.848
No.

40:52.872 --> 40:54.644
It's just...

40:55.408 --> 40:56.551
it's not going anywhere.

40:56.575 --> 40:59.472
We're not going anywhere.

40:59.499 --> 41:00.643
We have nothing in common.

41:00.667 --> 41:01.977
We both like running into fires.

41:02.001 --> 41:03.613
We both like that thing
I do with my tongue.

41:03.637 --> 41:06.322
You're a good guy,
and you're good in bed.

41:07.240 --> 41:09.618
But this was never going anywhere real.

41:12.812 --> 41:16.859
You're... You're dumping me
for no reason?

41:16.883 --> 41:18.427
You're ending this?

41:18.451 --> 41:22.620
After two major incidents
and no sleep, you're just...

41:25.458 --> 41:28.737
They're naming a new Fire Chief.

41:28.761 --> 41:30.307
Promotions will trickle down.

41:30.331 --> 41:31.743
Is that what this is about?

41:31.767 --> 41:33.284
Are you gunning for Captain, Maya?

41:33.308 --> 41:34.757
Jack, I care about you.

41:34.781 --> 41:36.543
I would literally run into
a burning building for you.

41:36.568 --> 41:38.379
- And now you're telling jokes.
- I want to be friends.

41:38.403 --> 41:40.181
Let's be friends.
