00:03.132 --> 00:04.465
Hi, Sam.

00:04.533 --> 00:06.033
Hi, Dr. Akoya.

00:06.102 --> 00:07.434
How are you doing?

00:07.503 --> 00:09.169
I'm okay.

00:09.238 --> 00:11.138
Been behaving yourself?

00:11.207 --> 00:13.540
Well, you're about to find out.

00:13.609 --> 00:15.809
You might find some evidence in there.

00:17.046 --> 00:18.412
Gosh, you're so crazy.

00:18.481 --> 00:21.315
I can see you haven't
been behaving yourself.

00:21.383 --> 00:23.650
You've got a belly full
of dicks there, young lady.

00:23.719 --> 00:25.385
Oh, God!

00:25.454 --> 00:28.122
- Sam, you must stop.
- Sorry.

00:28.190 --> 00:29.289
Okay, shall we take a look?

00:29.358 --> 00:31.191
Fine.

00:32.328 --> 00:34.728
Okay. Anyway,

00:34.797 --> 00:38.132
I was just kidding. I haven't
done anythi-ing.

00:47.910 --> 00:49.243
Okay?

00:49.311 --> 00:50.811
Yeah.

00:53.649 --> 00:55.616
Right. Okay.

00:55.684 --> 00:57.951
All good. All normal.

00:58.020 --> 01:03.490
Okay. Normal, like... for my age?

01:03.559 --> 01:04.792
How close am I?

01:04.860 --> 01:06.393
Close to...

01:06.462 --> 01:09.129
Like, have I shut down down there?

01:09.198 --> 01:10.497
Am I a man yet?

01:10.566 --> 01:12.199
Please tell me I'm close to being a man.

01:12.268 --> 01:13.634
No more periods.

01:13.702 --> 01:16.370
Sam, I hate to tell you,

01:16.438 --> 01:18.138
but you have the reproductive system

01:18.207 --> 01:19.473
of a 16-year-old.

01:19.542 --> 01:21.542
Oh, my God.

01:21.610 --> 01:25.279
Yeah. Your tubes are ripe and working.

01:25.347 --> 01:28.282
Jesus, that's so weird.

01:28.350 --> 01:30.184
Why?

01:30.252 --> 01:32.586
I don't know. I just... Because...

01:32.655 --> 01:34.888
Ew! Shut up. Stop talking about me.

01:34.957 --> 01:36.757
Okay. All right.

01:36.826 --> 01:39.226
Talk about you. When are you due?

01:40.496 --> 01:42.563
Any bloody minute, as you can see.

01:42.631 --> 01:44.898
Can I feel?

01:44.967 --> 01:47.000
- Yeah, of course.
- Ohh!

01:47.069 --> 01:49.903
Hello, there, baby.

01:49.972 --> 01:52.239
Your mommy's a doctor.

01:52.308 --> 01:56.610
And your daddy's a... Uh, writer?

01:56.679 --> 02:01.281
Yeah, yeah. He, uh, well,
he's trying to write.

02:01.350 --> 02:02.683
Mm.

02:06.555 --> 02:08.222
So this is so weird.

02:08.289 --> 02:11.158
Um, I went to Dr. Akoya today.

02:11.227 --> 02:12.426
She pregnant?

02:12.494 --> 02:13.627
Yeah.

02:13.696 --> 02:14.728
- Really?
- Oh, my God.

02:14.797 --> 02:16.063
I know. That's annoying.

02:16.131 --> 02:18.031
- Why?
- I don't know.

02:18.100 --> 02:20.078
She should take a leave of
absence when she's pregnant.

02:20.102 --> 02:22.536
- Why?
- I don't know.

02:22.605 --> 02:24.805
Oh, baby, are you pausing yet?

02:24.874 --> 02:27.541
No. Okay, so this is the weird thing.

02:27.610 --> 02:28.909
I assumed, you know.

02:28.978 --> 02:30.878
I thought I was at
the end of the rope here,

02:30.946 --> 02:33.680
and I was kind of hoping that
she was going to say that.

02:33.749 --> 02:37.284
But apparently I have
the reproductive system

02:37.353 --> 02:39.219
of a 16-year-old. Like,

02:39.288 --> 02:42.055
my tubes are really good,

02:42.124 --> 02:44.424
and my eggs are still coming,

02:44.493 --> 02:48.262
and I'm fully functional and productive

02:48.330 --> 02:52.032
and just the reproductive
system of a 16-year-old.

02:53.602 --> 02:54.568
Hmm.

02:55.871 --> 02:58.505
Did I fart? What's wrong?

03:00.376 --> 03:02.976
But your eggs are... fried.

03:03.045 --> 03:05.001
Right? I mean, they're... rotten.

03:05.002 --> 03:07.681
It's not like you can make anything.

03:07.750 --> 03:10.083
Um...

03:10.152 --> 03:12.286
Do you want to have a baby?

03:12.354 --> 03:14.821
- No. I just...
- Then why did you bring it up?

03:14.890 --> 03:16.957
I just thought it was funny.

03:17.026 --> 03:19.026
Oh. Well, it is. It's funny.

03:20.162 --> 03:22.462
Um, okay.

03:22.531 --> 03:25.009
I think I'm going to have the s'mores.

03:58.298 --> 03:59.864
As long as you're doing all this,

03:59.933 --> 04:01.866
can you help me out
on the chin a little?

04:01.935 --> 04:03.301
Do I have to be an alien

04:03.370 --> 04:05.870
who's also an aging lady with whiskers?

04:05.939 --> 04:08.106
Don't women on the planet Zeepzop

04:08.175 --> 04:10.342
get electrolysis or whatever?

04:11.745 --> 04:13.845
No, but seriously, can you...

04:15.449 --> 04:16.915
Hi, Sam.

04:16.983 --> 04:19.517
Oh. Hi.

04:19.586 --> 04:22.654
So, um, this is just...

04:22.723 --> 04:24.522
I'm sorry, but thank you so much.

04:24.591 --> 04:26.658
What?

04:26.727 --> 04:30.662
Uh, you can get out of
that make-up and go home.

04:30.731 --> 04:33.031
Home to the hotel?

04:33.100 --> 04:36.034
No. Home to Los Angeles.

04:36.103 --> 04:38.169
Oh.

04:38.238 --> 04:40.438
Oh.

04:40.507 --> 04:42.607
Got it. I'm fired.

04:42.676 --> 04:44.042
No. Not exactly.

04:44.111 --> 04:45.495
They decided that,

04:45.496 --> 04:47.323
instead of the Horvan
Crystal getting destroyed

04:47.347 --> 04:48.987
and then having to come
back to the planet

04:49.015 --> 04:50.593
to seek the source,
they're just going to go

04:50.617 --> 04:51.983
straight to the Peevan Galaxy.

04:52.052 --> 04:53.685
Oh. No. Totally.

04:53.754 --> 04:56.087
Also, we, uh, would really appreciate it

04:56.156 --> 04:58.757
if you didn't divulge any of
the story points to the public

04:58.825 --> 05:00.859
or post any selfies
while still in make-up.

05:02.195 --> 05:03.628
Copy that.

05:03.697 --> 05:04.963
Hi.

05:06.333 --> 05:07.699
Can we smoke in your cab?

05:11.872 --> 05:13.438
How many kids do you have, Curtis?

05:13.507 --> 05:15.273
I got four kids, man.

05:15.342 --> 05:17.242
Are any of them named Curtis?

05:17.310 --> 05:19.244
Uh-huh. No, them all girl, you see,

05:19.312 --> 05:21.980
but I'm on working on
getting me a Curtis,

05:22.048 --> 05:24.416
and I will not quit until I get me one.

05:25.819 --> 05:27.752
So how many kids you got, darling?

05:27.821 --> 05:29.554
I have three girls.

05:29.623 --> 05:31.022
Is the daddy a good man?

05:31.091 --> 05:34.426
Um... uh...

05:34.494 --> 05:35.527
I get the picture.

05:35.595 --> 05:36.728
That's why, cuz,

05:36.797 --> 05:38.329
I will never, never leave my children.

05:38.398 --> 05:39.731
Never.

05:39.800 --> 05:42.700
Yeah, so you get to
tuck them in every night,

05:42.769 --> 05:43.868
right, Daddy?

05:43.937 --> 05:46.905
Soon come. They live in Jamaica.

05:52.312 --> 05:53.745
- Yoo-hoo!
- Hi, Mom.

05:53.814 --> 05:55.616
- Hello, darling.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

05:55.617 --> 05:57.031
- Hi.
- Don't come over here.

05:57.032 --> 05:58.418
Don't come over here. Don't come...

05:58.419 --> 05:59.684
Have a good day, Mom.

06:00.501 --> 06:02.231
- What are you doing?
- I got to go...

06:02.255 --> 06:03.488
What are you doing?

06:03.557 --> 06:05.156
I just got back from working in Canada.

06:05.225 --> 06:08.526
Canada? You know, it's legal
to be a prostitute there.

06:08.595 --> 06:09.828
Fascinating, isn't it?

06:09.896 --> 06:11.329
If you're not a child.

06:11.398 --> 06:13.932
It's illegal to pay for a prostitute,

06:14.000 --> 06:15.667
but it's legal to be one.

06:15.735 --> 06:19.037
Oh. Good. Well, anyway...

06:19.105 --> 06:22.974
... they let me go a day early, so...

06:23.043 --> 06:24.909
Where are the girls?

06:24.978 --> 06:26.744
Well, I assume they're here,

06:26.813 --> 06:29.881
although they don't answer
their phones to torture me.

06:29.950 --> 06:31.249
Susie's with them.

06:31.318 --> 06:33.084
Oh. Why didn't you ask me to watch them

06:33.153 --> 06:34.886
- when you were gone?
- Oh, that's okay.

06:34.955 --> 06:36.154
Well, anyway, it's impossible

06:36.223 --> 06:37.228
because I couldn't have done

06:37.229 --> 06:39.068
because we have a neighborhood
watch meeting

06:39.092 --> 06:40.592
to discuss disaster response.

06:40.660 --> 06:43.361
Mom, I want to go inside now.

06:43.430 --> 06:44.629
Yes. I know.

06:44.698 --> 06:45.897
- Okay.
- Hold on a minute

06:45.966 --> 06:47.532
because what I wanted to tell you

06:47.601 --> 06:49.767
was that I'm building up my muscles.

06:49.836 --> 06:51.302
And look. Look at my arm.

06:51.371 --> 06:52.882
- That's good. Good.
- No, look. Feel it.

06:52.906 --> 06:55.039
- Nope.
- Because what's interesting

06:55.108 --> 06:56.908
is that my nail is falling off,

06:56.977 --> 06:58.754
- and that's disgusting.
- No. Mom, I don't...

06:58.778 --> 07:00.545
The muscles are really, really good.

07:00.614 --> 07:01.813
- Go on, feel them, Sam.
- No.

07:01.882 --> 07:03.147
Let me see yours, then.

07:03.216 --> 07:05.383
No, Mom! I don't want to stand outside

07:05.452 --> 07:08.620
and compare bodies with you
like we're grooming chimps.

07:10.223 --> 07:11.489
I'm sorry.

07:11.558 --> 07:13.691
Time to go home now, though.

07:15.061 --> 07:16.594
You certainly told me.

07:16.663 --> 07:18.663
Yes. Home. Now.

07:18.732 --> 07:20.031
All right.

07:23.870 --> 07:24.802
Ohh.

07:35.715 --> 07:37.181
Oh, shit.

07:40.754 --> 07:42.053
Oh, shit.

07:42.122 --> 07:44.489
Hello.

08:11.051 --> 08:13.551
No, Mom. I mean, you weren't even
supposed to be home today.

08:13.620 --> 08:14.986
We would have cleaned it all up.

08:15.055 --> 08:17.422
This... This doesn't even count.

08:17.490 --> 08:18.690
Sam?

08:20.660 --> 08:22.193
Hi, Susie.

08:22.262 --> 08:23.528
Hi.

08:23.597 --> 08:26.531
Susie, I didn't mean it.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.333
I didn't mean hi.

08:28.401 --> 08:30.034
Sorry.

08:30.103 --> 08:32.636
Where is Duke?

08:32.706 --> 08:34.371
Duke is sleeping at Lam's house,

08:34.441 --> 08:35.840
and Max...

08:35.909 --> 08:38.809
I don't give a shit
where Max is right now.

08:38.878 --> 08:41.446
Mom, you're freakazoid.

08:41.514 --> 08:43.014
Please stop freaking out

08:43.082 --> 08:44.627
so we don't have to send
you to a mental hospital.

08:44.651 --> 08:45.917
This is what I'm going to do.

08:45.986 --> 08:47.852
I'm going to go upstairs
and take a long nap,

08:47.921 --> 08:49.587
like Susie got to,

08:49.656 --> 08:52.724
and then I'm going to come downstairs,

08:52.792 --> 08:54.759
and all of this is going
to be cleaned up.

08:54.828 --> 08:57.996
Mom, I can't. I have soccer, remember?

08:58.064 --> 08:59.998
Are you taking me to soccer?

09:00.066 --> 09:01.633
I'll take her.

09:07.538 --> 09:08.938
Hello.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.506
Hi, Mom.

09:10.575 --> 09:12.475
Hello, darling.

09:12.543 --> 09:14.744
Uh, tell me about your muscles

09:14.812 --> 09:15.757
and the water thing.

09:15.758 --> 09:17.947
You can do it now if you want.

09:18.016 --> 09:22.485
Oh. Well, you know Marshall Sanders.

09:22.553 --> 09:24.920
Uh, well, he's the watch commander,

09:24.989 --> 09:28.224
and his wife died last year,

09:28.292 --> 09:30.493
and I don't know whether
I'm making it up,

09:30.561 --> 09:32.661
but I think he's got his eye on me

09:32.730 --> 09:35.598
because do you remember how he looked
at me in the grocery store?

09:35.666 --> 09:36.877
And then I thought to myself,

09:36.879 --> 09:40.236
God, "watch commander"... Aptly named.

09:40.304 --> 09:41.670
But I might be wrong. Anyway,

09:41.739 --> 09:42.905
but the thing is,

09:42.974 --> 09:44.573
I was very, very pleased

09:44.642 --> 09:46.509
that he chose me to
be in charge of water

09:46.577 --> 09:48.744
because I thought it was
quite a responsible position,

09:48.813 --> 09:51.147
don't you think? It is, isn't it?

09:51.215 --> 09:54.517
And so I've got to be very on the ball

09:54.585 --> 09:55.985
in case there's an earthquake.

09:56.054 --> 09:57.720
Uh, and then he'll be pleased with me,

09:57.789 --> 09:58.754
don't you think?

10:00.124 --> 10:01.624
Anyway,

10:01.692 --> 10:04.260
so the doctor says
I'm losing muscle mass,

10:04.328 --> 10:06.028
- but he's a liar.
- Uh-huh.

10:06.097 --> 10:08.297
And he can't tell me
what's happening to my body

10:08.366 --> 10:09.965
because I know.

10:10.034 --> 10:13.969
So I'm trying to decide
if I should sue him.

10:14.038 --> 10:16.038
What do you think?

10:16.107 --> 10:17.773
And then he'd stop.

10:27.185 --> 10:28.851
Phil.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.052
Yes, darling?

10:30.121 --> 10:31.987
Do you have any vodka?

10:32.056 --> 10:34.190
I always have vodka.

10:41.466 --> 10:43.232
What was the name of the man

10:43.301 --> 10:45.534
that you were dating
when you met my dad?

10:48.539 --> 10:50.039
Audrey.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.240
That's right.

10:51.309 --> 10:53.742
That's amazing. Audrey.

10:53.811 --> 10:54.810
Hmm.

10:54.879 --> 10:57.146
He swept me off my feet.

10:57.215 --> 10:59.148
Then why didn't you marry him?

10:59.217 --> 11:01.517
Oh, no, no. You don't marry the man

11:01.586 --> 11:03.152
who sweeps you off your feet.

11:03.221 --> 11:05.421
You marry the man
who pulls you back down

11:05.490 --> 11:06.755
and grounds you,

11:06.824 --> 11:08.491
takes care of you.

11:09.760 --> 11:10.926
My dad.

11:10.995 --> 11:12.828
No.

11:14.132 --> 11:15.865
What do you mean?

11:15.933 --> 11:20.636
I met Audrey in 1960,

11:20.705 --> 11:24.273
and I fell in love immediately.

11:24.342 --> 11:28.611
And he took me to New Zealand
to live by a vineyard

11:28.679 --> 11:34.049
while he picked grapes
for about five cents a pound.

11:34.118 --> 11:36.552
And then I met Joseph,

11:36.621 --> 11:38.687
and he was an American businessman.

11:38.756 --> 11:41.624
He was very small and serious.

11:41.692 --> 11:43.459
And he saw me in the Village,

11:43.528 --> 11:47.496
and he said, "I'm gonna marry you,"

11:47.565 --> 11:51.167
and told me how much he made

11:51.235 --> 11:53.636
and he could provide for me,

11:53.704 --> 11:58.874
and so I grew up,
and I said yes to Joseph.

11:58.943 --> 12:01.343
What the hell?

12:01.412 --> 12:04.346
What the hell, Mom. I
don't know this story.

12:04.415 --> 12:06.348
What happened to Joseph?

12:06.417 --> 12:09.385
Well, we were getting ready

12:09.453 --> 12:11.587
to go back to the States
the get married,

12:11.656 --> 12:13.756
and I said good-bye to Audrey.

12:13.824 --> 12:18.093
But then Joseph died.

12:20.498 --> 12:23.365
Jesus. He died?

12:23.434 --> 12:25.301
He drowned.

12:25.369 --> 12:29.205
He got drunk and fell in a puddle.

12:29.273 --> 12:31.273
Well, it was raining.

12:31.342 --> 12:34.810
And so then I went back to Audrey.

12:34.879 --> 12:38.080
And then two years later,
I met your father.

12:43.187 --> 12:46.555
So why did you marry my dad?

12:48.693 --> 12:50.292
I don't know.

12:50.361 --> 12:52.428
Why'd you marry him?

12:52.496 --> 12:53.963
I don't know...

12:54.031 --> 12:55.531
Why'd you marry my dad?

13:33.372 --> 13:36.406
So are you ever gonna say something?

13:36.475 --> 13:38.842
About what?

13:38.910 --> 13:40.577
Oh, my God. Nothing.

13:42.381 --> 13:44.781
Are you ever gonna say something?

13:44.850 --> 13:45.915
About what?

13:45.984 --> 13:48.351
Oh! About my dad leaving.

13:48.420 --> 13:50.787
What?

13:50.856 --> 13:52.722
Yeah, I didn't think so.

13:54.860 --> 13:57.193
Max, you had a party.

13:57.262 --> 14:00.263
No, it wasn't a
party. And anyway, you left.

14:00.332 --> 14:05.035
- I had to work.
- God, you don't have to work, Mom.

14:05.103 --> 14:09.606
What? How do you think
we ever have anything?

14:09.675 --> 14:13.410
You work because you wanna be famous.

14:13.478 --> 14:16.246
Dad told me. You have tons
of money in savings,

14:16.314 --> 14:19.482
and he is living like shit.

14:19.551 --> 14:22.252
This is so unfair that I
think I'm gonna pass out.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.251
Oh, my God. Yeah, Mom,
you're the victim.

14:24.252 --> 14:26.389
Everything is unfair.

14:31.763 --> 14:36.633
Max, I try like hell
to be fair to your father

14:36.702 --> 14:38.334
and not put you in the middle.

14:38.403 --> 14:41.337
I'm human, but I do try that.

14:41.406 --> 14:46.643
But you're 16 now, and that's
old enough to know how unfair it is

14:46.712 --> 14:49.312
what you just said to me.

14:49.381 --> 14:51.981
You know, it really disgusts me

14:52.050 --> 14:54.250
how you will sometimes say anything

14:54.319 --> 14:57.420
to avoid
responsibility for your mistakes.

14:57.489 --> 15:03.059
You had a party, and
you wrecked the house.

15:03.128 --> 15:05.095
You're not the first kid to do that.

15:05.163 --> 15:07.230
It's not the end of the world.

15:07.299 --> 15:10.600
Then why are you acting like it is?

15:10.669 --> 15:13.269
Because you make me get this mad

15:13.338 --> 15:16.112
before you even look up from your phone!

15:17.476 --> 15:19.943
And you act like your shit don't stink

15:20.011 --> 15:21.489
and you shouldn't answer for anything.

15:21.513 --> 15:22.746
But you know what, baby?

15:22.814 --> 15:24.647
Your shit does stink.

15:24.716 --> 15:27.951
And your father lives better than I do!

15:28.019 --> 15:30.086
And I pay for all of it!

15:40.866 --> 15:42.532
Answer your phone.

15:46.204 --> 15:47.804
Hello?

15:47.873 --> 15:50.151
If you can meet me somewhere tomorrow
at ten in the morning,

15:50.175 --> 15:52.809
then we can do it maybe even twice.

15:52.878 --> 15:54.210
I have a meeting at noon.

15:55.981 --> 15:57.814
Yes, I will be there then.

15:59.484 --> 16:00.683
Bye.

16:06.767 --> 16:07.991
20 years instead kids

16:07.992 --> 16:09.764
they never left, they
let... It's like this amazing story.

16:09.788 --> 16:11.319
So I asked if I could do my project,

16:11.320 --> 16:13.647
like, I have three of my friends
stay in my basement for, like, a month.

16:13.648 --> 16:16.238
And then we all write about it afterwards
to see what it felt like.

16:16.262 --> 16:19.062
And it was like...
Mom, are you listening?

16:19.131 --> 16:22.966
- Yes. What? Tell me.
- Ugh! Mom, listen.

16:23.035 --> 16:25.380
- Okay, go. - I'm telling you about
this because it's important!

16:25.404 --> 16:27.204
Frankie, don't speak
to your mother like that!

16:27.273 --> 16:29.551
Ugh! Anyway, my teacher was
like, "No, you can't do that."

16:29.575 --> 16:31.141
But I was like, "Oh, This is just so...

16:31.210 --> 16:33.644
- Mommy, I don't get what this is.
- Oh, my God!

16:33.712 --> 16:34.878
- Frankie!
- Hey!

16:34.947 --> 16:36.613
Stop. Save it for later.

16:36.682 --> 16:39.583
Oh, I wanna kill everybody.

16:39.652 --> 16:42.355
- Calm down.
- Mommy, what is this ever gonna do?

16:42.356 --> 16:44.928
It's this women and girls empowerment
thing, and it's annoying.

16:44.990 --> 16:47.291
Women and girls empowerment is annoying?

16:47.359 --> 16:48.892
It is the way my school does it.

16:48.961 --> 16:51.595
The people get up there
and they talk and they ruin it.

16:51.664 --> 16:53.864
Oh, well, I'll try not to ruin it.

16:53.933 --> 16:55.799
Now, come on, we're
here for your mother.

16:55.868 --> 16:57.401
- No, we're not.
- Yes, we are.

16:57.469 --> 16:59.203
Hey, Patty.

16:59.271 --> 17:01.905
Sam, thank God you're here.

17:01.974 --> 17:03.473
Hi, Miss Donner. Donner, Donner...

17:03.542 --> 17:05.142
Did you think I wasn't gonna come?

17:05.211 --> 17:07.243
Well, two of my speakers flaked on me.

17:07.313 --> 17:09.445
- Oh, my God.
- I'm gonna start.

17:09.515 --> 17:12.449
- Okay, so who's on first?
- It's just you.

17:12.518 --> 17:15.252
- Oh, shit.
- Darling!

17:15.320 --> 17:17.054
Okay? I'm starting.

17:17.122 --> 17:19.423
- Donner, Donner, Donner, Donner.
- God!

17:19.491 --> 17:23.426
I am so happy you all could come

17:23.494 --> 17:27.097
to our women and girls
empowerment seminar.

17:27.165 --> 17:29.215
We have one guest speaker.

17:29.440 --> 17:33.308
And tonight she's
gonna speak about being a mom

17:33.377 --> 17:35.778
- and having a career.
- Nobody cares.

17:35.846 --> 17:40.349
Please welcome our very own Sam Fox.

17:40.417 --> 17:42.751
Oof.

17:45.489 --> 17:47.923
Yeah, Mom! Go, Mom!

17:56.167 --> 17:59.101
Thank you, Patty.

17:59.170 --> 18:01.670
Um, well...

18:01.739 --> 18:05.641
I work and I am a mom.

18:05.709 --> 18:09.611
And some of you might later in life

18:09.680 --> 18:14.183
find yourselves in the
same situation, I hope.

18:14.251 --> 18:20.155
Because you girls
can be anything you want.

18:20.224 --> 18:22.057
You know, when I was a girl,

18:22.126 --> 18:25.127
no one ever really said
that women had jobs,

18:25.196 --> 18:28.430
except Marlo Thomas
and Mary Tyler Moore.

18:28.499 --> 18:31.533
Thank you, Henry.

18:31.602 --> 18:35.404
But, uh...

18:35.472 --> 18:38.006
we can do it all!

18:38.075 --> 18:41.176
And we have to do it all,
because in the end,

18:41.245 --> 18:45.247
the mom, the women,
are the ones left watching.

18:52.189 --> 18:53.722
Okay, this is...

18:56.327 --> 18:59.061
Let me ask you all a question.

18:59.129 --> 19:02.698
How many girls out there
get your period?

19:04.735 --> 19:06.735
Yeah, you heard me.

19:06.804 --> 19:11.139
If anybody here has got their
period yet, put your hand up.

19:11.208 --> 19:12.875
Put your hand up. It's okay.

19:12.943 --> 19:14.376
It's okay.

19:14.445 --> 19:16.345
Who's cotton-holing?

19:16.413 --> 19:18.013
I know, gross.

19:18.082 --> 19:20.682
But we're all girls and women here.

19:20.751 --> 19:22.117
It's just us.

19:22.186 --> 19:25.587
So come on, Frankie, help me out.

19:25.656 --> 19:28.590
- Mom!
- Come on, raise your hand.

19:28.659 --> 19:31.360
Listen, Frankie and I
went through it last week.

19:31.507 --> 19:34.769
She was stealing her sister's
tampons for half a year before she told me.

19:34.832 --> 19:36.598
- Mom!
- Frankie.

19:36.667 --> 19:37.900
Be a leader. Get your hand up.

19:37.968 --> 19:40.002
- Mom!
- Help 'em out.

19:41.739 --> 19:43.939
Good girl! There!

19:44.008 --> 19:46.308
Anybody else? Who
else here? Who's bleeding?

19:46.377 --> 19:50.112
There you go! Good! So brave!

19:50.180 --> 19:52.814
Come on, moms, let's hear it for them.

19:52.883 --> 19:57.152
All right, who here has
not gotten their period yet?

19:57.221 --> 19:59.855
Wow! Okay!

19:59.924 --> 20:02.557
Well, you girls are in
for it. You really are.

20:02.626 --> 20:04.593
But we all got your backs, right?

20:04.662 --> 20:08.196
Who here is having
their period right now?

20:08.265 --> 20:10.599
I know I am! Can you tell?

20:10.668 --> 20:12.334
All right! Thank you!

20:12.403 --> 20:15.337
Mrs. Donner! Yeah!

20:15.406 --> 20:18.240
Moms? Thank you! Hands, hands.

20:18.309 --> 20:21.243
Sisters all!

20:21.312 --> 20:26.715
Who here has stopped getting
their period altogether?

20:26.784 --> 20:29.718
Aunt Flo has left the station forever.

20:31.221 --> 20:34.122
Mom. Mom.

20:37.194 --> 20:38.727
Thank you!

20:38.796 --> 20:41.663
Thank you for that! Thank you!

20:45.169 --> 20:47.836
Look, we're all girls,
and we're all women.

20:47.905 --> 20:51.073
And we all bleed, and we all suffer.

20:51.141 --> 20:54.643
And then the bleeding stops,
and we still suffer.

20:54.712 --> 20:56.345
But you're gonna find your own path,

20:56.413 --> 20:59.548
because we're tough, and we can take it.

20:59.616 --> 21:01.950
And as long as you believe in yourself,

21:02.019 --> 21:04.553
and you take care of each other

21:04.621 --> 21:06.321
and watch out for each other,

21:06.390 --> 21:08.590
you just make the
rest up as you go along.

21:08.659 --> 21:10.425
That's all there is to it.

21:10.494 --> 21:12.894
That's it! Thank you!

21:12.963 --> 21:15.664
Thank you! Thank you, Detroit!

21:23.941 --> 21:27.175
Good job, Mom. Also, I hate you.

21:27.244 --> 21:29.691
I know. It's okay.

21:41.615 --> 21:43.748
- Okay.
- Yeah.

21:45.018 --> 21:46.451
Do you have a condom?

21:48.789 --> 21:51.289
- No.
- You need to use a condom.

21:55.162 --> 21:57.295
You never asked me before.

21:57.364 --> 21:58.763
I know.

22:00.987 --> 22:01.947
Shit.

22:02.002 --> 22:05.637
- Wait, wait. I'll be right back.
- What?

22:05.706 --> 22:07.105
Stay.
