01:42.396 --> 01:44.064
<i>Good evening, child.</i>

01:46.358 --> 01:47.609
'Evening, Mother.

01:47.734 --> 01:49.903
Home already? I'm so glad.

01:51.071 --> 01:52.781
Not so fast.

01:52.906 --> 01:54.908
Mother, leave me alone.
I'm tired.

01:55.033 --> 01:56.785
I can believe that!

01:56.952 --> 01:59.413
Your last pupil was three hours ago.

01:59.621 --> 02:02.499
Might I know
where you've been all this time?

02:02.624 --> 02:03.625
Please.

02:03.750 --> 02:06.461
No, not until you tell me!

02:10.799 --> 02:13.093
I went for a walk.
Do you mind?

02:13.218 --> 02:17.222
I spent eight hours in my cage.
I was tired and needed some air.

02:17.347 --> 02:19.683
- For three hours?
- That's right!

02:39.745 --> 02:41.496
That's just great.

02:41.705 --> 02:43.540
Just as I thought.

02:53.592 --> 02:55.302
Where's the bankbook?

03:00.682 --> 03:02.642
10,000 schillings!

03:03.226 --> 03:05.604
Have you completely
lost your mind?

03:08.273 --> 03:10.859
Where's my dark-gray fall outfit?

03:11.193 --> 03:13.111
No idea.

03:14.863 --> 03:16.365
Give that back.

03:23.663 --> 03:25.040
Bitch!

03:25.999 --> 03:27.876
<i>I remember that talk show.</i>

03:28.126 --> 03:30.420
<i>The guy advocated fines for dog owners</i>

03:30.670 --> 03:32.631
<i>whose dogs crap in the street.</i>

03:32.756 --> 03:33.715
<i>Bullshit.</i>

03:34.424 --> 03:38.804
<i>That creep was saying that women</i>
<i>should be treated as inferior.</i>

03:39.054 --> 03:40.097
<i>Nonsense.</i>

03:40.222 --> 03:42.432
<i>If I may get a word in -</i>

03:42.557 --> 03:44.059
<i>No one asked you!</i>

03:57.072 --> 03:59.574
You should have
your hands chopped off.

04:00.325 --> 04:02.494
Striking your own mother!

04:07.707 --> 04:10.085
That outfit was
far too gaudy anyway.

04:10.293 --> 04:12.838
At your age,
you should know what suits you.

04:12.963 --> 04:15.257
Can't you drop it, you bitch?

04:15.424 --> 04:17.509
Wasn't ruining this enough?

04:18.468 --> 04:20.387
I wish -
- What?

04:21.846 --> 04:25.684
Can't even say it, right?
No need. I know what you wish.

04:26.101 --> 04:29.062
I could have had a heart attack
from the agitation.

04:29.187 --> 04:31.606
If that's what you want, keep it up!

04:31.773 --> 04:34.776
Stop it, Mother.
You don't know what you're saying.

04:35.610 --> 04:37.404
I have a gash here.

04:38.196 --> 04:39.698
And here.

04:41.950 --> 04:43.660
I'm sorry.

04:43.785 --> 04:46.163
But why do you do these things?

04:46.371 --> 04:49.291
Why do <i>you</i> do these things?

04:51.293 --> 04:54.421
I'm really sorry, Mother.

04:55.130 --> 04:56.798
Let me look.

05:06.850 --> 05:08.810
It's okay.

05:11.771 --> 05:14.983
That's just how we are.
We're a hot-blooded family.

05:15.984 --> 05:17.944
Stop crying, now.

05:20.071 --> 05:21.823
I'll make some coffee.

05:23.325 --> 05:26.495
We'll have a cup together.
All right?

05:27.162 --> 05:28.914
<i>Nothing in life is free.</i>

05:30.040 --> 05:33.126
<i>Youâ€™ll just have to give</i>
<i>more private lessons.</i>

05:34.127 --> 05:38.507
<i>Your vanity's not going to stop us</i>
<i>from buying our apartment.</i>

05:39.174 --> 05:42.010
<i>I hope you're not going</i>
<i>to say otherwise!</i>

05:42.636 --> 05:46.223
I paid this month's installment long ago.
Don't worry.

05:49.184 --> 05:52.187
Besides, the dress was only 6,500.

05:52.354 --> 05:55.190
I'll put the rest
back in the bank tomorrow.

05:55.857 --> 05:57.484
<i>I don't understand</i>

05:57.609 --> 06:00.862
why someone of your standing
plasters the makeup on

06:01.029 --> 06:03.114
and fritters money away

06:03.573 --> 06:06.368
on outfits that will soon be
out of fashion.

06:06.701 --> 06:10.789
I could have worn that dress for years.
It was a classic cut.

06:11.456 --> 06:13.041
It doesn't go out of style.

06:16.503 --> 06:18.463
If memory serves me right,

06:18.588 --> 06:21.967
you had one like it
when you were young.

06:22.092 --> 06:23.718
You must be dreaming.

06:23.927 --> 06:27.430
It was a designer label.
The finishing was remarkable.

06:28.431 --> 06:30.559
It would have lasted forever.

06:34.813 --> 06:37.107
Do you still need the light?

06:57.085 --> 06:59.796
Did they really get
on your nerves today?

07:01.131 --> 07:03.008
No more than usual.

07:05.260 --> 07:08.638
You had the Schober girl, right?
Isn't she on Friday?

07:12.976 --> 07:14.477
Well?

07:16.688 --> 07:18.607
She's not untalented.

07:19.649 --> 07:22.944
She has a surprising affinity
for Schubert.

07:26.990 --> 07:30.118
Schubert's your department.
Don't forget that.

07:30.452 --> 07:32.787
That's not for you to say.

07:34.039 --> 07:37.792
You're hardly a judge
of what my musical department is.

07:38.418 --> 07:42.005
If you want your pupils
to have a career instead of you...

07:50.180 --> 07:52.891
No one must outdo you, my girl.

07:57.479 --> 07:59.230
Don't be foolish.

08:03.568 --> 08:05.320
Don't worry, Mother.

08:20.585 --> 08:23.505
THE PIANO TEACHER

08:31.805 --> 08:34.182
<i>A little less pedal wouldn't hurt.</i>

08:36.684 --> 08:39.645
<i>That doesn't mean</i>
<i>just taking your foot off!</i>

08:40.980 --> 08:43.857
<i>A note might not be held</i>
<i>as long as written</i>

08:44.025 --> 08:46.820
<i>or written</i>
<i>as long as it should be held.</i>

08:46.945 --> 08:49.864
Based on the Novel by
ELFRIEDE JELINEK

08:50.156 --> 08:53.368
<i>... two... three... four!</i>

09:07.674 --> 09:10.218
<i>Dogs are barking</i>

09:12.220 --> 09:14.889
<i>Their chains are rattling</i>

09:15.724 --> 09:18.393
<i>People are sleeping</i>

09:18.601 --> 09:22.355
<i>In their beds</i>

09:22.480 --> 09:25.567
<i>Do you have any idea</i>
<i>what "coldness"means?</i>

09:25.734 --> 09:27.777
Or perhaps you just don't care?

09:30.363 --> 09:31.990
And release.

09:37.620 --> 09:40.248
The music isn't purely descriptive.

09:41.875 --> 09:45.503
And it's not drenched
in indifference and sentimentality.

09:47.005 --> 09:48.423
And release.

09:48.757 --> 09:50.175
You see?

09:51.342 --> 09:55.638
<i>Dogs are barking</i>

09:55.930 --> 09:59.976
<i>Their chains are rattling</i>

10:00.185 --> 10:04.105
<i>People are sleeping</i>

10:04.355 --> 10:08.067
<i>In their beds</i>

10:45.480 --> 10:50.026
A wrong note in Beethoven is less
offensive than mangling the spirit of it.

10:51.820 --> 10:54.155
All you play are short phrases.

10:54.280 --> 10:57.492
Keep ignoring the structure
and you'll ruin the sonata.

11:00.995 --> 11:03.373
Again from the top of the page.

13:06.537 --> 13:09.040
I guessed you were here
for the recital.

13:09.165 --> 13:10.750
Allow me to introduce -

13:10.875 --> 13:14.796
- Professor, do come in!
- Hello, Auntie.

13:15.046 --> 13:17.173
And your mother.
Good evening.

13:17.382 --> 13:19.592
Did you meet my nephew?

13:19.717 --> 13:23.179
I was about to introduce myself.
Walter Klemmer.

15:40.274 --> 15:42.360
I know it sounds prosaic,

15:42.485 --> 15:46.572
after sampling spiritual nourishment
of such quality,

15:46.781 --> 15:49.575
but for the break
I've organized a buffet

15:49.784 --> 15:52.453
to sustain the artists,

15:52.578 --> 15:55.414
and, I hope,
for your pleasure too.

16:10.346 --> 16:12.098
My husband's very particular -

16:12.306 --> 16:13.808
Excuse me, Auntie.

16:14.183 --> 16:16.727
Sorry to interrupt,
but I couldn't wait.

16:16.936 --> 16:19.897
I hope I don't offend
by kissing the hand

16:20.022 --> 16:21.649
that plays Bach so beautifully.

16:21.816 --> 16:23.442
Please stop there.

16:23.568 --> 16:26.279
Where do you come
by such outdated enthusiasm?

16:27.280 --> 16:30.491
I'm delighted the tradition
of private recitals lives on.

16:30.616 --> 16:32.660
It's practically gone extinct.

16:32.785 --> 16:35.163
First the masters die,
then their music.

16:35.329 --> 16:38.207
People today
only listen to pop or rock.

16:38.332 --> 16:41.210
You're right.
There aren't families like this anymore.

16:41.419 --> 16:43.754
Entire generations of laryngologists

16:43.880 --> 16:46.299
once toiled
over Beethoven's last quartets.

16:46.424 --> 16:49.510
Now, at best, academics
stamp their feet in time

16:49.635 --> 16:52.805
to Bruckner's trumpety-trumps.

16:53.014 --> 16:55.308
Disdaining Bruckner is a youthful error,

16:55.433 --> 16:57.518
Mr... Klemmer?

16:59.353 --> 17:04.942
Tell me: What enables you
to speak of music so precociously?

17:05.358 --> 17:07.444
Your aunt said you studied -

17:07.569 --> 17:10.573
Low-voltage current.

17:10.698 --> 17:15.036
It was made between 1620 and 1630
by Marcel Pichler of Hallein.

17:15.161 --> 17:17.038
It's a rare piece.

17:23.085 --> 17:24.753
It's played...

17:26.088 --> 17:27.798
like a cello.

17:28.049 --> 17:31.219
It's commonly called
a treble viol or Quinton.

17:31.385 --> 17:36.724
I recently found a painting
that shows this exact instrument.

17:37.058 --> 17:41.103
Not this type of instrument.
I mean this specific instrument.

17:42.772 --> 17:46.234
The painting depicts a concert
of several viola da gamba

17:46.359 --> 17:50.071
at the court of Duke Augustus
Von Braunschweig-WolfenbÃ¼ttel.

17:50.905 --> 17:53.950
Can I get you something?
- No. Why?

17:55.952 --> 17:58.204
Fascinating!

17:58.579 --> 18:00.081
Look at them.

18:00.248 --> 18:03.960
You think they give a damn
about the benefits of illness?

18:07.004 --> 18:11.300
Have you read Adorno
on Schumann's Fantasia in C Major?

18:12.927 --> 18:14.929
He speaks of Schumann's twilight.

18:15.930 --> 18:19.642
It's not the Schumann bereft of reason,
but just before that.

18:19.767 --> 18:21.477
A fraction before.

18:22.436 --> 18:24.272
He knows he's losing his mind.

18:24.438 --> 18:27.858
It torments him,
but he clings on one last time.

18:30.528 --> 18:33.948
It's the moment of knowing
what it means to lose oneself

18:34.073 --> 18:36.534
before being completely abandoned.

18:37.994 --> 18:40.329
I suspect you're a good teacher.

18:41.664 --> 18:43.124
Thank you.

18:43.624 --> 18:47.253
You speak of things
as if they were yours. That's rare.

18:48.296 --> 18:50.131
And I think you know it.

18:50.464 --> 18:53.509
Schubert and Schumann
are my favorites, that's all.

18:54.468 --> 18:58.347
And my father died completely mad
in the Steinhof asylum.

18:58.931 --> 19:03.060
So it's not hard for me to speak
of the "twilight of the mind."

19:06.314 --> 19:08.899
If you really want nothing to eat,

19:09.400 --> 19:12.320
perhaps you'd care
for a drink of something?

19:12.862 --> 19:14.405
Go ahead.

19:23.539 --> 19:26.459
You have to sing for your supper here!

19:26.584 --> 19:30.004
Dr. Blonskij is a real bore
with his fetish for instruments.

19:30.880 --> 19:32.340
Say...

19:32.465 --> 19:36.302
that Klemmer or whatever he's called
is a clingy one, isn't he?

19:36.469 --> 19:39.430
Walter studies
in the School of Engineering,

19:39.847 --> 19:42.683
but his musicality belies
his technical background,

19:42.808 --> 19:45.936
as you'll understand
when you hear him play.

19:46.187 --> 19:47.855
Over to you, Walter.

19:54.236 --> 19:56.864
My uncle exaggerates shamelessly.

19:57.198 --> 19:59.867
After Professor Kohut's
magnificent performance,

20:00.034 --> 20:02.203
I feel twice as amateurish.

20:02.453 --> 20:05.748
I had intended to play
SchÃ¶nberg's Opus 33b...

20:06.457 --> 20:10.461
hoping my wrong notes would have
a better chance of going unnoticed.

20:10.669 --> 20:12.797
Not very funny, I know.

20:12.922 --> 20:16.342
But a discussion during the break
about Schubert and Schumann's madness

20:17.093 --> 20:19.345
left me quite moved.

20:19.887 --> 20:22.306
So I decided to set SchÃ¶nberg aside

20:22.515 --> 20:24.975
and play my favorite piece
by Schubert:

20:25.101 --> 20:27.728
the Scherzo
from the Sonata in A Major.

21:41.093 --> 21:44.263
<i>"... dreaming of things they don't have,</i>
<i>feasting themselves on good and bad.</i>

21:44.472 --> 21:46.474
<i>Next morning, all has vanished."</i>

21:46.599 --> 21:49.310
And here the mood
switches to irony.

21:50.144 --> 21:51.979
D... D... D...

21:52.146 --> 21:55.024
"Yet still...

21:55.483 --> 21:58.569
they've had their share of pleasure."

21:58.694 --> 22:02.156
That rhythm is the obstinacy
of the middle class.

22:02.281 --> 22:05.493
"And hope that what they left behind...

22:08.496 --> 22:12.583
<i>will be found once again</i>
<i>on their pillows."</i>

22:12.833 --> 22:16.003
Excuse me, Professor.
May I have a word?

22:16.253 --> 22:17.463
Certainly.

22:17.588 --> 22:22.176
Anna says you're not sure she should
play in the anniversary concert.

22:22.676 --> 22:24.845
I said a soloist needs
more than talent.

22:25.012 --> 22:26.680
Doesn't she practice enough?

22:26.847 --> 22:28.224
Only she knows that.

22:28.349 --> 22:30.392
She puts in eight hours a day.

22:30.768 --> 22:33.354
It's the end result, not the hours.

22:33.479 --> 22:35.856
Music's all she cares about.
Look at her.

22:42.947 --> 22:45.241
Schubert isn't a walk in the park.

22:45.491 --> 22:47.451
I didn't say you wouldn't play.

22:47.576 --> 22:50.287
We'll see how you do with the singer.

22:50.996 --> 22:53.874
Excuse me.
I have an appointment. Good-bye.

22:55.918 --> 22:57.586
The professor is right.

22:57.711 --> 23:00.673
Without total commitment,
you'll get nowhere.

23:00.881 --> 23:03.467
Now wipe your nose.
You look awful.

23:06.095 --> 23:09.390
Hello, Erika.
Your mother wants you to call her.

23:11.225 --> 23:12.893
I just got here.

23:15.646 --> 23:17.940
I don't know.
At least three hours.

23:20.901 --> 23:23.112
No, Mother. Please!

23:26.156 --> 23:27.992
Then I'll catch a taxi.

23:32.580 --> 23:34.373
I'm not a baby.

23:34.748 --> 23:36.542
I have to go now.

24:09.408 --> 24:13.454
Could we play the trill the same?
I'm starting on the upper note.

27:23.143 --> 27:30.484
<i>Bark me away, you wakeful dogs</i>

27:30.692 --> 27:38.492
<i>Let me not rest</i>
<i>in the hours of slumber</i>

27:42.037 --> 27:50.170
<i>I'm finished with all dreaming</i>

27:51.505 --> 28:01.504
<i>Why should I tarry</i>
<i>among those who sleep?</i>

28:51.023 --> 28:53.358
Sorry to disturb you.

28:53.942 --> 28:55.360
What is it?

28:55.861 --> 28:56.987
Professor Kohut?

28:58.238 --> 29:00.115
Yes. What do you want?

29:00.574 --> 29:03.243
One doesn't burst in
during a lesson here.

29:03.869 --> 29:06.246
I apologize. I'm really sorry,

29:06.455 --> 29:10.459
but I wanted to speak to you
rather than ask just anyone.

29:10.792 --> 29:11.919
About what?

29:12.085 --> 29:15.547
The entrance exam.
I'd like to join your master class.

29:16.423 --> 29:18.550
That's very flattering, young man.

29:19.509 --> 29:22.262
I hope you don't think
interrupting like this

29:22.387 --> 29:24.765
will arouse interest
your talents don't merit.

29:25.265 --> 29:29.770
Application forms are available
in the secretary's office.

29:30.187 --> 29:32.397
First floor, door 11.

29:33.065 --> 29:35.734
Please excuse us.
We have work to do.

29:35.943 --> 29:37.361
Continue.

29:38.570 --> 29:39.947
Go on.

29:51.708 --> 29:54.211
<i>The storm has torn asunder</i>

29:54.336 --> 29:56.838
<i>The gray robe of the sky</i>

29:57.130 --> 29:59.466
<i>Tatters of clouds flutter around</i>

29:59.716 --> 30:01.593
<i>In feeble combat</i>

30:44.928 --> 30:47.681
- Mr. Walter Klemmer?
- That's right.

30:47.848 --> 30:49.141
Please.

30:54.896 --> 30:57.107
Your program is particularly difficult.

30:57.357 --> 30:59.526
Where do you wish to begin?

30:59.735 --> 31:01.361
Wherever you prefer.

31:01.862 --> 31:05.449
Professor, it's your class
Mr. Klemmer wishes to join.

31:05.907 --> 31:08.493
Which piece would you like
to hear first?

31:08.702 --> 31:11.413
I don't care. The first on the list.

31:12.539 --> 31:13.999
Go ahead.

33:48.778 --> 33:50.113
Well?

33:50.322 --> 33:52.073
Stunningly brilliant.

33:53.450 --> 33:55.911
Seriously,
I think it wasn't too bad.

33:56.119 --> 33:58.246
He just put "private lessons."

33:58.371 --> 34:00.290
That's even more remarkable.

34:00.415 --> 34:04.336
I don't know how seriously
he takes his engineering,

34:04.461 --> 34:07.672
but for someone whose priority
is not the piano, bravo.

34:07.881 --> 34:09.132
It's amazing.

34:09.257 --> 34:11.676
I quite agree.
He's very talented.

34:11.927 --> 34:13.386
Ladies? Gentlemen?

34:13.969 --> 34:16.473
- I vote in favor.
- Me too.

34:16.973 --> 34:18.766
No doubt about it.

34:18.891 --> 34:20.685
Erika, what do you say?

34:20.810 --> 34:24.231
Your opinion counts most.
He's applying to join your class.

34:26.690 --> 34:30.402
After such euphoria,
it's hard to voice reservations.

34:31.237 --> 34:34.114
I can't say I completely share
your enthusiasm.

34:34.532 --> 34:37.577
He clearly doesn't lack talent,
but I have to wonder:

34:37.702 --> 34:39.746
What does he expect from us?

34:40.621 --> 34:43.083
He's too old for a professional career.

34:43.667 --> 34:48.004
Choosing him would mean turning away
a more motivated student.

34:48.964 --> 34:54.010
And, frankly, I find his histrionics suspect,
if not downright unpleasant.

34:54.636 --> 34:57.013
I don't see what you mean.

34:57.305 --> 35:00.475
In the Andantino
there were no "histrionics,"

35:00.600 --> 35:01.851
as you put it.

35:01.977 --> 35:04.604
Everyone knows that our views
on Schubert diverge.

35:04.813 --> 35:08.149
Let's not waste time on that.
Twenty people are waiting.

35:08.358 --> 35:10.652
I'm not the person to nurture

35:10.777 --> 35:13.446
Mr. Klemmer's artistic temperament
or virtuosity.

36:44.704 --> 36:47.040
<i>Erika, dinner's ready!</i>

36:55.048 --> 36:56.883
Coming, Mother!

39:01.674 --> 39:04.135
<i>Sit down.</i>
<i>I'm just getting the sauce.</i>

39:08.348 --> 39:10.225
May I turn off the TV?

39:10.350 --> 39:12.185
<i>If it bothers you.</i>

39:23.321 --> 39:25.073
You don't like the TV?

39:27.659 --> 39:29.118
I'm tired.

39:29.327 --> 39:30.828
I can tell.

39:31.287 --> 39:33.373
Are the auditions that exhausting?

39:34.082 --> 39:36.125
More boring than anything.

39:37.293 --> 39:39.212
That's tiring too.

39:42.423 --> 39:44.050
What's wrong with you?

39:44.842 --> 39:46.678
- What do you mean?
- Look.

39:48.555 --> 39:51.099
Is that why
you're in a bad mood?

39:51.224 --> 39:52.892
Be more careful!

39:53.560 --> 39:55.562
It's not very appetizing!

39:56.396 --> 40:00.275
<i>"Mare in heat seeks</i>
<i>spirited and successful stallion</i>

40:00.483 --> 40:03.903
<i>for jumping and dressage.</i>
<i>Must be at least eight inches..."</i>

40:04.028 --> 40:06.281
Hello, Mr. Naprawnik.

40:07.615 --> 40:09.284
Hello, Professor.

40:20.128 --> 40:21.629
Who's that?

40:22.714 --> 40:24.674
My piano teacher.

40:28.469 --> 40:31.639
Don't bring out
the inner voices so much.

40:31.889 --> 40:34.100
Do you know where the melody is?

40:37.604 --> 40:40.565
It's as clear as a dirty windshield.

40:41.441 --> 40:44.611
Probably from all the images
in your mind.

40:53.786 --> 40:58.082
You approach Bach, Beethoven,
and all the rest the same way.

41:00.460 --> 41:02.962
What made you want to study music?

41:03.880 --> 41:07.508
Your meager talent?
I assure you it's not worth it.

41:07.925 --> 41:10.511
Get a job playing in a strip joint

41:10.637 --> 41:12.597
and stop wasting my time.

41:14.390 --> 41:15.475
What?

41:17.560 --> 41:19.812
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

41:21.314 --> 41:24.067
For earlier, at the newsstand.

41:26.235 --> 41:27.737
Why?

41:30.657 --> 41:32.492
Why are you sorry?

41:33.409 --> 41:34.952
For what?

41:35.578 --> 41:37.413
It doesn't work like that.

41:37.580 --> 41:40.500
Sorry isn't enough
if I don't know why.

41:42.085 --> 41:44.420
Are you sorry because you're a pig?

41:44.587 --> 41:46.964
Or because your friends are pigs?

41:47.173 --> 41:51.177
Or because all women are bitches
for making you a pig?

41:52.929 --> 41:55.223
Or just because you got caught?

42:00.520 --> 42:01.854
The lesson's over.

42:04.482 --> 42:07.485
I suggest you have
your mother come see me.

42:07.610 --> 42:10.405
Perhaps she can shed
some light on this.

42:12.365 --> 42:13.825
Well?

42:14.951 --> 42:16.953
What are you sorry for?

42:18.454 --> 42:20.039
I'm listening.

42:22.208 --> 42:24.210
The silence is deafening.

42:25.503 --> 42:28.297
I'll see you next time -
with your mother.

42:28.423 --> 42:30.299
Now kindly leave.

42:30.550 --> 42:32.760
I'll need my break to recover.

42:49.026 --> 42:50.403
Good-bye.

43:30.568 --> 43:32.403
This time I'm expected.

43:32.612 --> 43:34.655
The break's not over.

43:35.156 --> 43:37.533
And the lesson hasn't begun.

43:37.784 --> 43:40.953
May I take out my scores while I wait?

43:55.927 --> 43:58.137
You know I voted against you?

44:00.640 --> 44:03.643
I don't believe you're seriously
interested in music,

44:04.018 --> 44:06.604
only the acclaim it brings you.

44:06.813 --> 44:08.731
You know that's not true.

44:10.983 --> 44:12.985
And even if it were...

44:13.402 --> 44:15.947
would it be such a shameful motive?

44:17.156 --> 44:18.616
Yes.

44:23.579 --> 44:25.540
What did you bring?

44:27.416 --> 44:29.627
You should forget about Schubert.

44:32.672 --> 44:35.091
I fought to get your attention, Erika.

44:35.633 --> 44:37.009
Give me a chance.

44:37.176 --> 44:40.221
I know you're not as indifferent
as you pretend.

44:40.346 --> 44:42.139
I've neglected my studies for you.

44:42.849 --> 44:44.392
It's true.

44:45.309 --> 44:47.645
It may seem ridiculous to you...

44:48.104 --> 44:50.648
but since that recital
at the Blonskijs'...

44:51.983 --> 44:55.820
you've been stuck in my mind
like a nut on a bolt,

44:55.945 --> 44:58.865
if you'll pardon
the rather technical analogy.

44:59.824 --> 45:02.159
But I never intended to apply here.

45:02.326 --> 45:04.537
Stop lying.
It won't work with me.

45:04.912 --> 45:06.455
I'm not lying.

45:08.416 --> 45:11.043
For next time,
bring a copy of Opus 19.

45:12.211 --> 45:14.088
Let's talk first. Please.

45:15.214 --> 45:17.174
I don't see the point.

45:18.384 --> 45:21.554
Don't just stand there.
Sit down and start.

45:27.560 --> 45:29.312
Is this your last lesson?

45:29.520 --> 45:30.771
Please!

45:31.022 --> 45:34.066
Pretend you have
a migraine or something.

45:34.442 --> 45:35.776
It's lovely weather -

45:35.902 --> 45:39.322
Start playing or my migraine
will end this lesson.

47:45.448 --> 47:47.366
<i>It's bound to finish late.</i>

47:47.533 --> 47:50.536
Today's our first
Mendelssohn rehearsal.

47:52.371 --> 47:56.042
So please don't call every five minutes.
It's embarrassing.

47:57.710 --> 48:01.964
And Viora of the Philharmonic's coming.
He'll think I'm a little girl.

48:04.216 --> 48:05.426
Is that clear?

48:05.634 --> 48:08.054
<i>If it runs late, take a taxi.</i>

48:09.180 --> 48:12.016
Yes, Mother. Bye.

48:14.894 --> 48:18.939
I adore lying in the name of love.
I'm so happy for you.

48:19.148 --> 48:22.234
If she calls after 10:00,
don't answer, all right?

48:22.401 --> 48:24.070
It will be a pleasure.

49:29.760 --> 49:32.054
Good evening.
This is Mrs. Kohut.

49:32.346 --> 49:34.431
May I speak to my daughter?

53:03.682 --> 53:05.768
What's wrong?

53:07.895 --> 53:08.937
What the...?

53:15.110 --> 53:16.862
Shit!

53:20.199 --> 53:21.825
Come back here!

53:23.744 --> 53:25.788
Come back here, you cunt!

54:44.116 --> 54:46.034
Are you crazy or what?

54:48.954 --> 54:51.623
Your father died this afternoon.

55:01.800 --> 55:03.469
Above all, keep calm.

57:36.830 --> 57:40.709
You're taking all this quite casually!
You realize the consequences -

57:40.834 --> 57:44.087
Kind of you to honor us
with your presence.

57:44.713 --> 57:46.840
Might we know what kept you?

57:49.676 --> 57:52.012
Stop the dramatics.
What happened?

57:53.847 --> 57:55.599
I have diarrhea.

57:55.807 --> 57:57.559
Is it stage fright?

58:00.354 --> 58:02.522
A pianist needs solid nerves.

58:02.648 --> 58:05.442
- I don't know if I can sing -
- That's enough.

58:05.567 --> 58:07.611
We should be going up.

58:10.322 --> 58:12.032
Don't be such a ninny.

58:12.282 --> 58:14.910
They won't bite.
It's just a rehearsal.

58:17.663 --> 58:19.665
Did I overestimate you?

01:00:22.204 --> 01:00:26.041
<i>Dogs are barking</i>

01:00:26.166 --> 01:00:29.795
<i>Their chains are rattling</i>

01:00:30.045 --> 01:00:33.632
<i>People are sleeping</i>

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:37.969
<i>In their beds</i>

01:00:42.557 --> 01:00:49.731
<i>Dreaming of many things</i>
<i>they do not have</i>

01:00:50.190 --> 01:00:57.948
<i>Feasting themselves on good and bad</i>

01:03:44.447 --> 01:03:48.410
<i>Why then do I shun the paths</i>

01:03:48.618 --> 01:03:53.331
<i>That other travelers take</i>

01:03:55.834 --> 01:04:00.630
<i>And seek out hidden pathways</i>

01:04:00.839 --> 01:04:05.635
<i>Through snowbound rocky heights?</i>

01:04:23.194 --> 01:04:28.074
<i>And yet I've done nothing</i>

01:04:28.324 --> 01:04:32.871
<i>To make me flee my fellow man</i>

01:04:38.001 --> 01:04:42.881
<i>What is this foolish longing</i>

01:04:43.256 --> 01:04:47.635
<i>That drives me into the wilderness?</i>

01:04:54.309 --> 01:04:58.813
You think I lack sensitivity,
and yes, alas, I'm often superficial.

01:04:58.938 --> 01:05:00.857
You see, I admit it.

01:05:01.524 --> 01:05:05.236
But telling me to forget
about Schubert was terribly unfair.

01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:07.739
It's actually just the opposite.

01:05:07.864 --> 01:05:10.742
There are days,
like after our first lesson -

01:05:18.208 --> 01:05:21.252
The sight of blood makes me ill.
Go to her.

01:05:21.377 --> 01:05:23.213
Play the brave protector.

01:05:31.387 --> 01:05:33.556
- What happened?
- Let me.

01:05:34.432 --> 01:05:35.767
Call a doctor.

01:05:35.934 --> 01:05:40.105
There's nothing to see here.
Go back to the hall.

01:07:35.637 --> 01:07:37.222
Come.

01:07:40.350 --> 01:07:41.559
Wait.

01:07:41.684 --> 01:07:43.061
Why?

01:07:44.896 --> 01:07:46.397
Why?

01:08:06.084 --> 01:08:07.543
Stop it.

01:08:17.595 --> 01:08:21.599
If you don't stop immediately,
I'm leaving.

01:08:35.738 --> 01:08:38.032
Look at me, not your penis.

01:08:39.283 --> 01:08:40.785
Be quiet.

01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:43.287
Don't move or I'll leave.

01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:09.939
I love you.

01:09:10.732 --> 01:09:12.483
No one has -

01:09:13.026 --> 01:09:16.612
If you won't be quiet,
you'll end up all alone here.

01:09:16.821 --> 01:09:18.740
Why are you hurting me?

01:10:26.516 --> 01:10:27.934
I can't hold back.

01:10:28.059 --> 01:10:29.894
I said be quiet!

01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:33.481
Keep going. Come here.

01:11:00.883 --> 01:11:03.136
That's it. It's coming.

01:11:03.886 --> 01:11:05.513
Don't stop!

01:11:07.181 --> 01:11:10.101
I'll write down
what you can do to me.

01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:15.022
All my desires on paper
for you to peruse at will.

01:11:15.523 --> 01:11:17.108
You don't seem pleased -

01:11:17.275 --> 01:11:19.318
You can't leave me like this.

01:11:19.569 --> 01:11:20.987
Come on.

01:11:21.988 --> 01:11:24.240
I have no desire to touch it now.

01:11:24.449 --> 01:11:25.908
Keep going, please.

01:11:26.033 --> 01:11:27.869
Out of the question!

01:11:34.625 --> 01:11:37.170
Hands off, Mr. Klemmer,

01:11:37.295 --> 01:11:39.672
or we never see each other again.

01:11:42.258 --> 01:11:44.635
It's totally sick
what you're doing here.

01:11:45.803 --> 01:11:47.638
And it hurts!

01:11:48.431 --> 01:11:50.141
I sympathize.

01:12:01.319 --> 01:12:02.695
Stop it.

01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:05.281
Don't be stupid.
You're ruining everything.

01:12:19.003 --> 01:12:20.755
I won't touch you again.

01:12:24.383 --> 01:12:27.345
I want you to stay like that,
that's all.

01:12:29.514 --> 01:12:31.182
Facing me!

01:12:37.772 --> 01:12:39.440
Don't put it away.

01:12:47.198 --> 01:12:49.700
I'm not the one who's stupid.

01:12:50.159 --> 01:12:51.577
You are.

01:12:53.371 --> 01:12:56.666
You should know what you can
and can't do to a man.

01:12:56.791 --> 01:12:58.709
Bitch...
- Shut up!

01:12:59.794 --> 01:13:02.213
The playing field has to be level.

01:13:04.090 --> 01:13:05.675
If you think -

01:13:07.885 --> 01:13:09.387
Wait.

01:13:11.639 --> 01:13:13.391
I won't move. I promise.

01:13:14.058 --> 01:13:15.810
I won't say a word.

01:14:37.975 --> 01:14:40.144
You'll receive my instructions.

01:14:41.646 --> 01:14:43.105
By letter.

01:14:43.981 --> 01:14:46.817
Or in person.
Or maybe over the phone.

01:14:49.987 --> 01:14:52.073
Now you can put it away.

01:14:53.658 --> 01:14:55.076
Facing me.

01:15:53.008 --> 01:15:54.969
How about a little smile?

01:15:56.887 --> 01:15:58.389
Come on.

01:15:58.931 --> 01:16:01.392
Don't be so serious, pretty lady.

01:16:03.102 --> 01:16:04.562
Come on.

01:16:22.830 --> 01:16:25.958
Next time we'll do much better.
I promise.

01:16:28.502 --> 01:16:30.880
Practice will make you perfect.

01:16:33.549 --> 01:16:35.551
At least two months,

01:16:35.676 --> 01:16:37.762
with no guarantee
of complete recovery.

01:16:37.887 --> 01:16:39.764
That's terrible.

01:16:40.431 --> 01:16:44.727
And she really played quite well.
She has the nerves for it.

01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:48.939
She played amazingly yesterday,
despite nearly not making it.

01:16:51.525 --> 01:16:53.527
Pull yourself together.

01:16:53.652 --> 01:16:57.031
You'll be no help to Anna
breaking down like this.

01:16:59.366 --> 01:17:01.702
All we can do now is wait.

01:17:02.244 --> 01:17:04.288
She mustn't neglect her left hand.

01:17:04.455 --> 01:17:06.582
That's always her weak point.

01:17:06.791 --> 01:17:08.793
She'll be scarred for life.

01:17:09.043 --> 01:17:12.004
Just imagine.
A pianist with a disfigured hand.

01:17:12.129 --> 01:17:16.217
She's hardly attractive.
Her talent was all she had going for her.

01:17:16.967 --> 01:17:19.178
That's why we sacrificed everything.

01:17:19.804 --> 01:17:22.097
You mean
why <i>she</i> sacrificed everything.

01:17:23.265 --> 01:17:24.600
Sorry?

01:17:24.725 --> 01:17:27.895
You said "we sacrificed."
It's Anna who sacrificed everything.

01:17:28.145 --> 01:17:29.772
Yes, of course.

01:17:30.815 --> 01:17:32.858
Who would do such a thing?

01:17:32.983 --> 01:17:36.237
The police say it must have been
another student

01:17:36.362 --> 01:17:38.280
acting out of jealousy.

01:17:40.115 --> 01:17:42.159
Can you imagine?

01:17:42.535 --> 01:17:44.328
Being that evil?

01:17:45.538 --> 01:17:48.958
She's always been a loner.
She hardly has any friends.

01:17:49.083 --> 01:17:51.502
They'll find the man who did it.

01:17:52.002 --> 01:17:54.672
His hands should be chopped off.

01:17:54.922 --> 01:17:59.635
My next lesson is waiting.
I must ask you to leave.

01:17:59.844 --> 01:18:03.389
Tell Anna she's welcome
to drop in when she's better.

01:18:09.144 --> 01:18:11.397
And remind her about her left hand.

01:18:11.981 --> 01:18:14.775
I'll tell her.
Thank you very much.

01:18:15.276 --> 01:18:18.028
She'll come by.
She admires you so much.

01:18:18.195 --> 01:18:20.197
Chin up, Mrs. Schober.

01:18:22.199 --> 01:18:25.077
Who'll take Anna's place
in the concert?

01:18:25.619 --> 01:18:27.121
No one.

01:18:27.246 --> 01:18:30.291
No student could do it
on such short notice.

01:18:30.499 --> 01:18:33.961
I've been asked to fill in
for the singer's sake.

01:18:34.253 --> 01:18:36.422
Good. Anna will be pleased.

01:18:36.547 --> 01:18:38.090
Good-bye.

01:19:57.795 --> 01:19:59.088
Stop.

01:20:06.762 --> 01:20:08.472
Back to the beginning.

01:20:15.312 --> 01:20:19.149
You seem oblivious to the dynamics.
What does it say?

01:20:20.109 --> 01:20:22.444
<i>- Piano.</i>
- Exactly. And then?

01:20:24.488 --> 01:20:26.490
<i>- Forte-piano.</i>
- And then?

01:20:26.865 --> 01:20:27.908
<i>Pianissimo.</i>

01:20:28.033 --> 01:20:30.369
And <i>diminuendo, mezzo forte,</i>

01:20:30.494 --> 01:20:33.872
<i>forte, fortissimo, sforzatissimo.</i>

01:20:34.123 --> 01:20:38.669
Schubert's dynamics range from
scream to whisper, not loud to soft.

01:20:38.794 --> 01:20:42.339
Anarchy hardly seems your forte.
Why not stick to Clementi?

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:46.260
Schubert was quite an ugly man.
You know that, right?

01:20:46.969 --> 01:20:49.513
With your looks,
nothing can ever hurt you.

01:20:49.722 --> 01:20:52.891
Why try to destroy
what could bring us together?

01:20:58.022 --> 01:21:01.108
Can't you see?
I can't even look at you.

01:21:01.233 --> 01:21:05.529
If I do, I'll give in to the temptation
to kiss your neck.

01:21:06.697 --> 01:21:08.866
May I kiss your neck, Erika?

01:21:31.055 --> 01:21:33.098
Shall I get you some water?

01:21:54.411 --> 01:21:55.871
Thanks.

01:21:57.414 --> 01:21:59.208
When can I see you?

01:22:00.667 --> 01:22:02.669
We'll talk on the phone.

01:22:03.462 --> 01:22:06.256
Let's go away together
this weekend.

01:22:06.423 --> 01:22:08.634
My mother and I have
an engagement.

01:22:08.759 --> 01:22:10.010
Cancel it.

01:22:10.135 --> 01:22:12.262
Forget your mother.
Think about us.

01:22:12.638 --> 01:22:16.016
There's so much lost time to make up for.
- You mean me?

01:22:16.141 --> 01:22:18.560
I have lost time to make up for?

01:22:18.685 --> 01:22:21.271
Dear Erika, stop always thinking
about other people,

01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:23.607
your mother, your scruples.

01:22:24.858 --> 01:22:28.654
You speak of anarchy
but sacrifice love to be with Mother.

01:22:28.821 --> 01:22:32.282
Let yourself go.
Allow yourself feelings for once.

01:22:32.491 --> 01:22:34.493
Stop being so clingy!

01:22:39.665 --> 01:22:41.708
You cough
because you're so uptight.

01:22:41.875 --> 01:22:44.795
I have no feelings.
Get that into your head.

01:22:44.962 --> 01:22:48.966
And if I ever do,
they won't win out over my intelligence.

01:22:50.050 --> 01:22:52.469
I love you.
Don't be such a coward.

01:22:54.221 --> 01:22:57.266
Is what you wrote for me
just as cowardly?

01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:03.147
Don't touch it!

01:23:03.689 --> 01:23:05.149
Not now.

01:23:06.733 --> 01:23:08.986
I want you to read it alone.

01:23:11.613 --> 01:23:13.866
Now apply yourself to Schubert.

01:23:13.991 --> 01:23:16.785
That's all you're allowed to do
in this room.

01:23:32.718 --> 01:23:34.303
<i>Piano,</i> huh?

01:23:36.263 --> 01:23:39.558
Brahms would have put
<i>con intimissimo sentimento.</i>

01:24:42.037 --> 01:24:44.414
Are you crazy?
What are you doing here?

01:24:44.581 --> 01:24:46.124
I followed you.

01:24:46.375 --> 01:24:48.168
I said we'd talk on the phone.

01:24:48.377 --> 01:24:51.588
You can't drive me crazy like that
and then run off.

01:24:52.506 --> 01:24:54.383
Drive you crazy?

01:24:54.591 --> 01:24:58.470
Let's go somewhere
where we can talk in private.

01:25:01.098 --> 01:25:02.891
Did you read my letter?

01:25:03.642 --> 01:25:06.770
I'm not interested in letters.
I want us to talk.

01:25:09.564 --> 01:25:12.276
I advise you to leave now, Walter.

01:25:13.652 --> 01:25:16.280
Never hound the woman
you claim to love.

01:25:16.446 --> 01:25:19.366
You should know that,
even at your young age.

01:25:19.491 --> 01:25:21.535
If you value my affection, go.

01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:24.788
We'll make a date on the phone
tomorrow, okay?

01:25:25.455 --> 01:25:27.374
- Take off your hat.
- What?

01:26:00.949 --> 01:26:02.534
Good evening, ma'am.

01:26:02.743 --> 01:26:05.829
I have matters to discuss
with Mr. Klemmer.

01:26:06.580 --> 01:26:08.540
What's that supposed to mean?

01:26:08.999 --> 01:26:12.127
We won't bother you.
We'll go in my room.

01:26:12.252 --> 01:26:13.503
Come on.

01:26:16.298 --> 01:26:19.259
Don't try to come in
or you'll be sorry.

01:26:19.384 --> 01:26:22.387
We have no food to offer him.
I didn't expect visitors.

01:26:22.512 --> 01:26:24.765
Don't worry, ma'am.
I've eaten.

01:27:15.399 --> 01:27:17.150
First read my letter.

01:27:22.739 --> 01:27:24.574
You still have it, right?

01:27:26.743 --> 01:27:28.787
Then please read it now.

01:27:29.329 --> 01:27:31.581
You want to finish me off?

01:27:31.873 --> 01:27:34.584
I said I wasn't interested
in reading letters.

01:27:34.918 --> 01:27:36.962
I'm here, you're here.

01:27:37.754 --> 01:27:39.756
We're made of flesh and blood.

01:27:41.508 --> 01:27:43.260
Don't be so scared.

01:27:43.677 --> 01:27:47.389
I'm not. I want what you want.
But read it first.

01:27:52.769 --> 01:27:55.188
Is that why we barricaded the door?

01:27:55.772 --> 01:27:57.107
Maybe.

01:27:59.609 --> 01:28:01.153
Please.

01:28:02.571 --> 01:28:06.616
I don't know how much longer
I want to play this game.

01:28:19.129 --> 01:28:20.630
Heavy.

01:28:22.090 --> 01:28:23.925
Please sit over there.

01:29:50.929 --> 01:29:54.474
"On the contrary, if I beg,
please tighten the straps.

01:29:55.141 --> 01:29:58.979
Tighten the belt
by at least two or three notches.

01:29:59.437 --> 01:30:01.398
The tighter the better.

01:30:01.565 --> 01:30:05.777
Then gag me with
some old stockings I'll have ready.

01:30:07.779 --> 01:30:10.448
Stuff them in so hard
that I'm unable...

01:30:11.449 --> 01:30:13.410
to make the slightest sound.

01:30:15.537 --> 01:30:18.039
Next, please remove the gag...

01:30:18.707 --> 01:30:21.042
and sit on my face...

01:30:22.961 --> 01:30:25.422
and punch me in the stomach

01:30:25.922 --> 01:30:29.467
to force me to thrust
my tongue up your rear end."

01:30:52.115 --> 01:30:54.576
Am I supposed to take this seriously?

01:30:56.745 --> 01:30:58.705
You're putting me on, right?

01:31:01.541 --> 01:31:03.418
You want me to slap you?

01:31:24.606 --> 01:31:26.650
"For that is my dearest wish:

01:31:26.816 --> 01:31:29.527
with hands and feet
tied behind my back,

01:31:29.861 --> 01:31:33.323
to be locked in the room
next door to my mother

01:31:33.448 --> 01:31:36.493
but out of her reach,
behind my bedroom door,

01:31:36.743 --> 01:31:38.828
till the next morning.

01:31:39.329 --> 01:31:42.290
Don't worry about my mother.
She's my problem.

01:31:43.917 --> 01:31:47.253
Take the keys
to all the doors with you.

01:31:47.379 --> 01:31:49.506
Don't leave a single one here."

01:31:49.714 --> 01:31:52.175
What will all this get me?

01:32:01.810 --> 01:32:04.854
Maybe you could open up
that cultured mouth of yours

01:32:04.979 --> 01:32:07.023
and comment on this shit!

01:32:25.125 --> 01:32:28.712
"If you catch me disobeying
any of your orders,

01:32:29.337 --> 01:32:31.423
please strike me in the face,

01:32:32.048 --> 01:32:34.801
even with the back of your hand.

01:32:38.304 --> 01:32:40.890
Ask me
why I don't cry out to Mother

01:32:41.015 --> 01:32:43.727
or why I don't fight back.

01:32:44.144 --> 01:32:46.396
Say things like that to me

01:32:46.730 --> 01:32:50.984
so that I realize
just how powerless I am."

01:32:51.276 --> 01:32:53.069
What's going on in there?

01:32:53.611 --> 01:32:55.739
Open up! Move that dresser!

01:32:55.989 --> 01:33:00.410
Want to let her in
so I can hit you in front of her?

01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:04.038
Calm down, Mother.
Be quiet and watch TV.

01:33:04.164 --> 01:33:06.082
Open up or you'll be sorry.

01:33:06.249 --> 01:33:09.002
- Stop making a scene!
- Unbelievable!

01:33:16.134 --> 01:33:18.428
Have you no decency, young man?

01:33:18.636 --> 01:33:23.266
Bursting into strangers' homes
in the middle of the night! The nerve!

01:35:45.074 --> 01:35:46.743
Are you angry with me?

01:35:49.746 --> 01:35:51.289
I hope not.

01:35:52.916 --> 01:35:55.585
I know it's not very well written.

01:35:56.419 --> 01:35:58.880
I'm a pianist, not a poet.

01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:05.970
And after all, love is built
on very ordinary things, right?

01:36:07.555 --> 01:36:12.435
Well, take your time and think it over.
You have my phone number.

01:36:17.273 --> 01:36:20.443
Like I said,
I want the same thing you want.

01:36:22.111 --> 01:36:24.280
I have everything we need.

01:36:28.076 --> 01:36:30.411
But it can wait till tomorrow.

01:36:39.295 --> 01:36:41.339
Are you not talking to me?

01:36:47.553 --> 01:36:49.597
I disgust you, right?

01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:54.060
You needn't feel that way.

01:36:55.478 --> 01:36:58.189
I've wanted to be beaten for years.

01:37:05.613 --> 01:37:07.657
I've waited for you, you know?

01:37:11.911 --> 01:37:14.872
What I wrote isn't a joke.
You know that.

01:37:17.834 --> 01:37:20.169
From now on, you give the orders.

01:37:23.715 --> 01:37:27.260
From now on,
you choose what I wear.

01:37:27.510 --> 01:37:30.513
What's your favorite color?
You haven't told me.

01:37:35.018 --> 01:37:37.603
Aren't you talking to me?
Are you angry?

01:37:43.067 --> 01:37:44.694
Say something.

01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:49.115
Erika, you're sick.

01:37:49.866 --> 01:37:51.659
You need treatment.

01:38:03.755 --> 01:38:06.466
If you want to hit me, hit me.

01:38:09.302 --> 01:38:11.596
I wouldn't soil my hands.

01:38:13.222 --> 01:38:16.392
One doesn't touch your kind
even with gloves on.

01:38:26.944 --> 01:38:28.905
I swear I loved you.

01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:33.409
But you don't even know what that is.

01:38:34.911 --> 01:38:36.871
Right now you repulse me.

01:38:41.709 --> 01:38:43.127
Fuck it.

01:39:00.019 --> 01:39:02.688
<i>... came to North America</i>
<i>with the Spanish.</i>

01:39:02.814 --> 01:39:05.900
<i>Left to roam free,</i>
<i>they became the famous mustangs.</i>

01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:10.780
<i>Today a cowboy's most loyal</i>
<i>companion is the quarter horse.</i>

01:39:11.072 --> 01:39:14.534
<i>Very fast over short distances</i>
<i>and with good stamina...</i>

01:39:53.614 --> 01:39:55.658
You really are quite shameless.

01:39:59.745 --> 01:40:01.789
What have you done with him?

01:40:05.126 --> 01:40:07.170
Is he still in your room?

01:40:09.338 --> 01:40:11.174
It wouldn't surprise me.

01:40:13.509 --> 01:40:15.511
But nothing surprises me anymore.

01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:26.689
But you can do what you want.

01:40:26.814 --> 01:40:28.482
At your age!

01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:39.202
Good Lord.

01:40:41.829 --> 01:40:44.123
All those sacrifices for this.

01:40:46.584 --> 01:40:48.878
That is what you get in reward.

01:40:56.385 --> 01:40:58.638
But just go right on.

01:40:58.971 --> 01:41:02.016
You can set up a brothel here.

01:41:03.851 --> 01:41:06.229
Who cares
what the neighbors think, right?

01:41:07.104 --> 01:41:09.440
As always, you do as you like -

01:41:09.565 --> 01:41:11.359
Mother, I love you!

01:41:12.735 --> 01:41:15.488
Stop it! Have you gone insane?

01:41:21.077 --> 01:41:24.163
Stop this filth!
You're out of your mind!

01:41:24.288 --> 01:41:26.874
Shut up! I love you!

01:41:27.124 --> 01:41:28.876
I love you too.

01:41:31.295 --> 01:41:33.297
But stop it now!

01:41:35.383 --> 01:41:36.842
You're mad!

01:42:22.305 --> 01:42:23.973
You're crazy.

01:42:25.975 --> 01:42:27.977
You're out of your mind.

01:42:40.656 --> 01:42:42.491
Go to sleep now.

01:42:45.953 --> 01:42:48.497
You're going to need
all your energy.

01:42:51.292 --> 01:42:55.629
Even if you're just filling in,
you have to be prepared.

01:42:57.340 --> 01:43:00.343
You never know
who might be in the audience.

01:43:31.791 --> 01:43:33.876
I saw your pubic hair.

01:44:56.250 --> 01:44:58.878
Walter, may I speak to you?

01:44:59.670 --> 01:45:01.839
Walter, someone to see you.

01:45:04.967 --> 01:45:07.303
Is that your little sister?

01:45:07.511 --> 01:45:09.513
Don't run off. He's coming.

01:45:20.441 --> 01:45:23.235
- What do you want?
- I want to talk to you.

01:45:23.694 --> 01:45:25.196
I'm listening.

01:45:26.155 --> 01:45:28.073
Not here. I can't.

01:45:29.742 --> 01:45:31.327
Down there.

01:45:35.206 --> 01:45:37.333
How did you manage to find me?

01:45:39.585 --> 01:45:41.086
Right there.

01:45:41.879 --> 01:45:43.339
Go on in.

01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:53.390
Forgive me for the letter.

01:45:54.517 --> 01:45:56.185
I was an idiot.

01:45:56.352 --> 01:45:59.730
I shouldn't have done that to you
out of the blue.

01:46:01.315 --> 01:46:04.026
Like you said,
we should have talked first.

01:46:14.578 --> 01:46:16.163
Forgive me.

01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:22.503
What are you doing?

01:46:22.628 --> 01:46:24.964
Stop it. Get up now.

01:46:25.548 --> 01:46:27.049
Come.

01:46:28.551 --> 01:46:30.344
Lie on top of me.

01:46:31.303 --> 01:46:33.931
You want me, don't you?
- You're crazy.

01:46:35.474 --> 01:46:37.601
Come on. I love you.

01:46:39.061 --> 01:46:41.939
I'll never write anything
you don't want.

01:46:42.398 --> 01:46:44.900
You tell me what you want, okay?

01:46:46.735 --> 01:46:49.905
Someone might come in.
You're being ridiculous.

01:46:50.114 --> 01:46:51.907
Get up!

01:46:58.831 --> 01:47:01.000
Hang on. Let me do it.

01:47:01.709 --> 01:47:03.627
I said let me do it.

01:47:27.943 --> 01:47:29.903
I can't. Not here.

01:47:30.112 --> 01:47:31.614
Stop. I can't.

01:47:32.531 --> 01:47:35.159
- It doesn't matter.
- I can't do it here!

01:47:39.288 --> 01:47:41.498
I know you want to protect us,

01:47:41.624 --> 01:47:45.002
but I don't care if people walk in.
I don't care.

01:47:46.253 --> 01:47:47.671
I love you.

01:48:05.147 --> 01:48:07.650
I love you too.

01:48:11.987 --> 01:48:13.489
Hold on.

01:48:22.748 --> 01:48:24.041
Come on.

01:48:36.595 --> 01:48:38.263
You have to help me.

01:49:11.588 --> 01:49:14.591
- I don't believe it!
- I'm sorry.

01:49:17.553 --> 01:49:19.054
Don't look.

01:49:22.808 --> 01:49:24.351
Don't look.

01:49:43.579 --> 01:49:45.456
I must really disgust you.

01:49:46.039 --> 01:49:48.292
No woman's ever puked
with me before.

01:49:48.417 --> 01:49:50.919
I'm sorry.
I don't know what happened.

01:49:54.089 --> 01:49:56.800
There... I'm clean now.

01:50:02.264 --> 01:50:03.724
I'm all clean.

01:50:05.267 --> 01:50:06.769
Like a baby.

01:50:08.228 --> 01:50:09.980
Inside and out.

01:50:10.397 --> 01:50:12.775
For you and thanks to you, darling.

01:50:13.901 --> 01:50:16.278
Do you like me calling you darling?

01:50:16.653 --> 01:50:18.447
It's absolutely marvelous.

01:50:18.781 --> 01:50:20.699
You have to be patient.

01:50:20.824 --> 01:50:24.953
I'll call you every name you like.
We'll play every game you want.

01:50:26.038 --> 01:50:28.457
You stink like hell.
You know that?

01:50:29.958 --> 01:50:34.004
Sorry, but you stink so bad
no one could ever get close.

01:50:34.213 --> 01:50:38.300
You'd better leave town
until you don't stink so bad.

01:50:39.551 --> 01:50:41.553
Rinse your mouth out more often,

01:50:41.678 --> 01:50:44.264
not just when my cock
makes you puke.

01:51:31.019 --> 01:51:32.229
Who is it?

01:51:32.521 --> 01:51:33.814
<i>Open up.</i>

01:51:35.232 --> 01:51:37.860
<i>Open up now!</i>
- What are you doing here?

01:51:38.694 --> 01:51:41.029
<i>I said open the door!</i>

01:51:43.156 --> 01:51:45.450
Quiet!
You'll wake the whole building.

01:51:45.576 --> 01:51:47.202
I'll open it.

01:51:52.875 --> 01:51:54.877
Never do that to me again, okay?

01:51:55.002 --> 01:51:57.880
- What do you mean?
- Shut up, you stupid bitch!

01:51:58.839 --> 01:52:00.382
Just now...

01:52:01.758 --> 01:52:03.552
I was outside your window.

01:52:04.678 --> 01:52:07.973
I was jerking off!
That's what you want, huh?

01:52:08.098 --> 01:52:11.393
Other people, you want to -
Is that it?

01:52:12.561 --> 01:52:15.188
You're a perverted bitch.

01:52:17.399 --> 01:52:20.736
You want to give everyone
your sickness, don't you?

01:52:20.861 --> 01:52:22.571
Not me!
- I already apologized.

01:52:22.696 --> 01:52:24.781
Fuck your stupid apologies!

01:52:24.907 --> 01:52:27.367
Wasn't last night enough for you?

01:52:27.492 --> 01:52:31.079
Is this to be a habit now,
raising a ruckus in others' homes?

01:52:31.580 --> 01:52:34.249
- Go back to bed, damn it!
- Walter -

01:52:35.167 --> 01:52:37.586
- Get out!
- Off with you... now!

01:52:37.753 --> 01:52:40.631
This isn't how you imagined it, huh?

01:52:40.964 --> 01:52:43.592
The police will put a stop to this.

01:52:44.259 --> 01:52:46.219
You stay out of this.

01:52:51.725 --> 01:52:53.268
Forget your mother.

01:52:53.810 --> 01:52:56.563
We have time. We have all night.

01:53:01.610 --> 01:53:03.946
Let's pick up where we left off.

01:53:04.863 --> 01:53:07.991
Is this really
what you had imagined?

01:53:09.576 --> 01:53:11.161
Then what?

01:53:11.703 --> 01:53:13.121
You'll be sorry.

01:53:13.246 --> 01:53:16.416
You won't get away with this
just because we're women.

01:53:16.541 --> 01:53:18.335
Let me go!

01:53:21.254 --> 01:53:22.881
This is unbelievable!

01:53:24.341 --> 01:53:28.011
- At least this door has a key.
- Open this door!

01:53:28.136 --> 01:53:31.264
How about a key
for your daughter's room too?

01:53:33.809 --> 01:53:35.477
That takes care of her.

01:53:37.854 --> 01:53:41.858
"As for my mother,
pay no attention to her." Was that it?

01:53:42.734 --> 01:53:44.987
That's an exact quote, isn't it?

01:53:58.834 --> 01:54:01.003
"Slap me around, darling."

01:54:03.338 --> 01:54:05.048
"Strike me hard -" no.

01:54:05.173 --> 01:54:07.634
"Strike me in the face, and hard."

01:54:12.139 --> 01:54:13.765
At your service, ma'am.

01:54:20.564 --> 01:54:23.442
Is that what you want?
- Please stop.

01:54:25.861 --> 01:54:27.029
Then what?

01:54:27.154 --> 01:54:30.115
Not that. Stop, I beg you.

01:54:37.205 --> 01:54:39.249
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:54:39.374 --> 01:54:41.543
Shut up or I'll kill her!

01:54:44.921 --> 01:54:46.465
<i>Stop this!</i>

01:54:48.216 --> 01:54:50.802
- Where's some water?
- In the kitchen.

01:54:55.348 --> 01:54:57.225
Don't think you'll get me excited

01:54:57.893 --> 01:54:59.936
by showing your pathetic body.

01:55:17.954 --> 01:55:19.414
You know...

01:55:20.123 --> 01:55:23.794
I do realize that all this
isn't very nice of me.

01:55:26.338 --> 01:55:30.675
But if you're honest,
you'll admit you're partly responsible.

01:55:32.803 --> 01:55:34.596
I mean, it's true...

01:55:35.639 --> 01:55:37.015
yes or no?

01:55:37.140 --> 01:55:38.558
Yes.

01:55:38.683 --> 01:55:40.227
Am I right?

01:55:40.477 --> 01:55:42.104
Yes, Walter.

01:55:49.861 --> 01:55:52.781
<i>- Are you all right?</i>
- I'm okay.

01:55:52.906 --> 01:55:57.369
You can't get a guy going
and then escape out onto the ice.

01:56:15.220 --> 01:56:17.222
Not my face or hands!

01:56:18.765 --> 01:56:20.267
<i>Murderer!</i>

01:56:21.643 --> 01:56:23.478
<i>You should be ashamed!</i>

01:56:25.063 --> 01:56:26.982
<i>Stop, I beg you.</i>

01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:30.402
<i>Don't touch my daughter.</i>

01:56:32.362 --> 01:56:34.948
<i>Leave my daughter alone.</i>

01:56:37.325 --> 01:56:39.202
<i>I'm begging you.</i>

01:56:40.036 --> 01:56:41.872
Why do you do that?

01:56:42.914 --> 01:56:46.001
I calm down,
and you get me worked up again.

01:56:47.961 --> 01:56:49.838
Cooperate a little, damn it.

01:56:53.967 --> 01:56:56.636
I'm willing to learn to play,
Professor...

01:56:57.637 --> 01:57:00.599
but it can't always be your rules.

01:57:03.018 --> 01:57:07.230
You can't dig around deep inside
people and then push them away.

01:57:19.618 --> 01:57:21.953
So be nice to me, please.

01:57:27.626 --> 01:57:30.045
You can't let me leave like this.

01:59:04.431 --> 01:59:06.016
Please stop.

01:59:06.683 --> 01:59:09.060
You have to give a bit too.

01:59:37.172 --> 01:59:39.591
You can't leave me all alone now.

01:59:40.717 --> 01:59:42.302
Love me, please.

02:00:10.747 --> 02:00:13.750
You're telling me I should go,
is that it?

02:01:20.525 --> 02:01:23.278
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't tell anyone.

02:01:25.113 --> 02:01:27.615
Besides, it's for your own good.

02:01:34.038 --> 02:01:36.791
You can't humiliate a man
that way and -

02:01:37.333 --> 02:01:38.918
You just can't.

02:01:50.555 --> 02:01:52.223
Will you be okay?

02:01:56.352 --> 02:01:58.146
You need anything?

02:01:58.938 --> 02:02:00.356
You okay?

02:02:02.901 --> 02:02:05.987
You know, love isn't everything.

02:02:09.491 --> 02:02:10.950
See you.

02:02:21.836 --> 02:02:23.505
<i>Is he gone?</i>

02:02:25.048 --> 02:02:27.050
<i>Say something. Is he gone?</i>

02:02:31.012 --> 02:02:32.514
<i>Open this door.</i>

02:02:34.015 --> 02:02:35.642
<i>Are you okay?</i>

02:02:36.184 --> 02:02:38.353
<i>Talk to me, for God's sake.</i>

02:03:13.513 --> 02:03:15.056
Oh my God!

02:03:15.265 --> 02:03:17.058
Look at you!

02:03:18.017 --> 02:03:20.311
What did that bastard do to you?

02:03:26.484 --> 02:03:28.695
<i>Hurry! We'll miss the streetcar.</i>

02:03:29.153 --> 02:03:31.281
I'm just getting some water.

02:03:36.995 --> 02:03:38.663
Don't be so nervous.

02:03:38.788 --> 02:03:40.832
You're just filling in.

02:04:16.784 --> 02:04:18.620
Good evening, Professor.

02:04:18.745 --> 02:04:21.998
I'm really looking forward
to your Schubert -

02:04:22.165 --> 02:04:25.918
I should take my seat.
It starts in eight minutes.

02:04:26.044 --> 02:04:27.962
I'll come up with you.

02:04:28.588 --> 02:04:32.467
Good evening, Professor.
I'm delighted to see you here.

02:04:32.884 --> 02:04:36.346
Look at our little convalescent.
Brave, isn't she?

02:04:36.554 --> 02:04:40.099
She insisted on coming
to hear you play.

02:04:42.435 --> 02:04:44.354
How are you doing, Anna?

02:04:45.688 --> 02:04:47.774
Allow me to introduce myself.

02:04:47.899 --> 02:04:50.360
I'm Mrs. Schober.
My daughter, Anna.

02:04:51.653 --> 02:04:53.279
This is my mother.

02:04:53.404 --> 02:04:57.075
Nice to meet you. You must be
very proud of your daughter.

02:04:57.200 --> 02:04:59.535
Why? It's just a school concert.

02:05:00.411 --> 02:05:02.538
She's filling in for a student.

02:05:02.789 --> 02:05:04.832
That student is my daughter.

02:05:04.957 --> 02:05:06.709
Where are you sitting?

02:05:11.130 --> 02:05:12.924
Not far from us.

02:05:14.217 --> 02:05:17.261
It's late. We'd better go.
Shall we go up together?

02:05:17.387 --> 02:05:18.888
Coming, Anna?

02:05:20.014 --> 02:05:22.725
See you later.
I'll go up with Mrs. Schober.

02:05:22.850 --> 02:05:23.935
Break a leg.

02:05:24.060 --> 02:05:25.561
Enjoy the concert.

02:05:25.728 --> 02:05:29.148
Good-bye.
It was a pleasure seeing you.

02:06:50.480 --> 02:06:53.107
Well, well!

02:06:53.900 --> 02:06:55.818
What a nice surprise!

02:06:56.986 --> 02:07:00.490
George, it's Professor Kohut.
- My respects.

02:07:00.615 --> 02:07:03.367
Gerda, hurry up.
Give me your coat.

02:07:03.493 --> 02:07:05.411
I'll keep it with me.

02:07:05.536 --> 02:07:08.539
Men! Always rushing you.
You know how it is.

02:07:08.664 --> 02:07:10.875
Have a wonderful evening.

02:07:12.752 --> 02:07:14.420
I hope we'll see you later.

02:07:14.545 --> 02:07:17.882
My respects, Professor.
I can't wait to hear you play.
