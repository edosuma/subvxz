WEBVTT

00:03.071 --> 00:04.538
You want a what?

00:04.572 --> 00:06.740
I want a headquarters.

00:06.774 --> 00:08.642
And it should say that
on the glass outside.

00:08.676 --> 00:12.713
"Headquarters!"
with an exclamation point.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.251
Pursuant to our
earlier conversation

00:17.285 --> 00:18.486
about a headquarters,
'd also like the chance

00:18.519 --> 00:20.054
to pick some of
my own cases.

00:20.088 --> 00:21.255
Excuse me.

00:21.289 --> 00:22.690
It's just that
it's all been

00:22.723 --> 00:24.458
data-sifting these
past few weeks

00:24.492 --> 00:27.528
and I want more cool,
fun stuff to do.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.630
Cool, fun stuff to do?

00:29.663 --> 00:30.664
That's right.

00:30.698 --> 00:31.765
And a headquarters
to do it in.

00:31.799 --> 00:34.302
With an exclamation
point after it.

00:34.335 --> 00:36.837
...joint operation
with Counterintelligence

00:36.870 --> 00:39.740
but make sure it's clear
that the CJC has point, yeah?

00:39.773 --> 00:42.776
Any questions?

00:42.810 --> 00:44.312
Yes?
Just wondering
where we stood

00:44.345 --> 00:47.681
vis-Г -vis
the headquarters negotiations?

00:50.618 --> 00:51.752
You realize you're
being ridiculous?

00:51.785 --> 00:52.853
Of course.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.323
Then why do you keep repeating
the word "headquarters?"

00:55.356 --> 00:56.324
Because.

00:56.357 --> 00:57.558
Every day
I come in here

00:57.591 --> 00:59.460
and this place tries to make me
a little bit more like it.

00:59.493 --> 01:01.295
I've done a lot now.

01:01.329 --> 01:02.496
It can be more like me.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.132
You know, fun, cool.

01:04.165 --> 01:05.166
Colorful.

01:05.199 --> 01:07.301
"It" is the FBI.

01:07.335 --> 01:09.170
You're Brian.

01:09.203 --> 01:11.139
Exactly.

01:11.172 --> 01:13.107
And there's a place where
those two entities meet--

01:13.141 --> 01:14.275
a happy medium,
if you will--

01:14.308 --> 01:16.277
and it is called
a headquarters.

01:17.545 --> 01:19.147
No.
Aw...!

01:21.149 --> 01:22.416
Hello.

01:22.450 --> 01:23.884
You know, Naz,

01:23.917 --> 01:25.586
I was really hoping
you wouldn't make me

01:25.619 --> 01:27.288
play this card...

01:27.321 --> 01:28.556
But remember that time,
like, three weeks ago,

01:28.589 --> 01:30.758
when you were
languishing in prison?

01:30.791 --> 01:32.560
And how I got you
out and stuff?

01:32.593 --> 01:36.164
If you would like
an office as a reward

01:36.197 --> 01:39.333
for good work,
we can discuss...

01:39.367 --> 01:40.368
No. Naz!

01:40.401 --> 01:42.236
Boring stuff happen
s in an office.

01:42.270 --> 01:44.272
Cool stuff happens
in a headquarters.

01:44.305 --> 01:45.439
Oh.

01:46.640 --> 01:49.210
Can I call it an office and
you call it a headquarters?

01:49.243 --> 01:50.511
Yeah, Naz, you can call it
whatever you want

01:50.544 --> 01:52.213
in the privacy
of your own thoughts.

01:52.246 --> 01:53.514
But it has to say
"Headquarters!" on the door,

01:53.547 --> 01:54.848
with an exclamation point.
...an exclamation point.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.384
I get it,
I get it.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.419
But you do realize that
whatever what you call it,

01:58.452 --> 02:01.655
it's still the same
200 square feet of space.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.391
Yes, that's true.

02:03.424 --> 02:05.493
But if I let you
call it an office,

02:05.526 --> 02:06.927
then that makes me
one of you people.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.496
Oh, for goodness' sakes.

02:08.529 --> 02:10.331
Oh, Naz...

02:10.364 --> 02:13.634
Is this about that night
with your daughter?

02:15.303 --> 02:16.504
* No, no. No. No.

02:16.537 --> 02:17.905
* No. No, no, no, no.

02:17.938 --> 02:21.275
* No. No. No.
No. No. No. *

02:21.309 --> 02:22.576
* No. No. No. No.

02:22.610 --> 02:25.279
* No. No. No. No.
No. No. *

02:25.313 --> 02:26.380
* No. No. No.

02:27.515 --> 02:28.482
BRIAN:
So I'm thinking:

02:28.516 --> 02:29.683
how can I win Naz over?

02:29.717 --> 02:31.552
What's so cool
and so fun

02:31.585 --> 02:33.387
that no one,

02:33.421 --> 02:36.357
not even the enemies of joy,
could say "no" to?

02:36.390 --> 02:37.491
I give you:

02:37.525 --> 02:39.360
the members
of the FBI's

02:39.393 --> 02:41.329
Ten Most Wanted list.

02:41.362 --> 02:42.496
It's my first case.

02:42.530 --> 02:43.864
I'm going all in.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.866
(laughs)

02:45.899 --> 02:46.867
Ah!
(laughs)

02:46.900 --> 02:48.469
(phone whistles)
See? See?

02:48.502 --> 02:50.238
Not even the
enemies of joy

02:50.271 --> 02:51.872
can deny this plan.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.241
Well, you've got moxie.

02:53.274 --> 02:54.542
But you know what?
That's impossible.

02:54.575 --> 02:55.509
Even for you.
Oh, really?

02:55.543 --> 02:57.411
Give me two weeks, okay?

02:57.445 --> 02:58.546
And a few people to work with

02:58.579 --> 02:59.847
in-between their
regular case loads

02:59.880 --> 03:01.749
and I promise you, I will locate

03:01.782 --> 03:03.751
every one of
these people.
(phone chimes)

03:03.784 --> 03:05.219
Who are you texting?

03:05.253 --> 03:07.321
I made a friend
who just happens to be

03:07.355 --> 03:09.857
an anchor at a major news
station right here in New York.

03:09.890 --> 03:12.293
Just to show you that I'm
absolutely serious, Naz.

03:12.326 --> 03:15.229
This guy is Perry Granger.

03:15.263 --> 03:16.497
Currently number four
on the list.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.666
He bombed a bunch of
doctor's clinics in Iowa.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.234
I know who Perry Granger is.

03:20.268 --> 03:21.535
Oh, good.
Okay.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.504
Then you'll want to see this.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.673
Police were stunned
to get an anonymous tip

03:25.706 --> 03:27.975
that led to the arrest
of fugitive Perry Granger.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.310
Perry Granger has been
on the run...

03:29.343 --> 03:30.411
(TV shuts off)

03:30.444 --> 03:33.681
Do you remember Taurus?

03:33.714 --> 03:35.549
Bomb maker

03:35.583 --> 03:36.850
we picked up
a while back?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

03:36.884 --> 03:37.985
Well, I checked
in with him.

03:38.018 --> 03:42.523
Turns out Perry Granger
has been sending him letters.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.525
Fan mail, I guess
you could call it.

03:44.558 --> 03:45.659
So I bargained
with the warden

03:45.693 --> 03:47.595
to give Taurus more time
in the library.

03:47.628 --> 03:48.962
He showed me the letters.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.964
It wasn't too hard to put
it together from there.

03:50.998 --> 03:51.999
The point is,

03:52.032 --> 03:54.668
I just want the chance...

03:54.702 --> 03:56.737
the chance...

03:56.770 --> 03:58.772
to pick my own cases sometimes.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.808
And I think I've earned that.

04:06.380 --> 04:07.581
Yeah?

04:07.615 --> 04:09.016
(inhales)

04:09.049 --> 04:10.851
Epic!

04:10.884 --> 04:12.586
(exhales loudly)

04:12.620 --> 04:13.787
You're not gonna
regret this.

04:15.623 --> 04:16.590
That's one down,

04:16.624 --> 04:18.359
nine to go.

04:21.895 --> 04:24.898
*

04:36.677 --> 04:37.711
Naz said this was okay?

04:37.745 --> 04:38.712
BRIAN:
Yes.

04:38.746 --> 04:40.047
What is wrong
with you people?

04:40.080 --> 04:41.549
This is supposed
to be exciting.

04:41.582 --> 04:43.951
I would love to
round these guys up.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.619
But there are laws
of space and time

04:45.653 --> 04:47.321
that you just seem
to be blowing off.

04:47.355 --> 04:48.789
We're two people.

04:48.822 --> 04:49.923
I mean, forget the fact

04:49.957 --> 04:51.425
that we have to find them.

04:51.459 --> 04:52.760
We can't cover that much ground

04:52.793 --> 04:53.761
in two weeks.

04:53.794 --> 04:54.928
You know, you're right.

04:54.962 --> 04:55.929
We need a team.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.665
Like, a special unit.

04:57.698 --> 05:00.300
Who do we know?

05:01.769 --> 05:03.504
BRIAN:
Good morning.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.606
You're here today because
you are an elite group of people

05:05.639 --> 05:10.010
that I know
at the FBI.

05:10.043 --> 05:11.612
Welcome to the first
official meeting

05:11.645 --> 05:13.614
of the Brian Finch
and Rebecca Harris

05:13.647 --> 05:14.748
Amazing Major Crime Squad.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.384
You can leave me
out of the title.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.217
Why?
BOYLE:
Question.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.353
Uh, this place
is filled with boxes.

05:19.387 --> 05:20.621
Where are we
supposed to sit ?

05:20.654 --> 05:21.689
BRIAN:
Yeah.

05:21.722 --> 05:22.856
The seating
arrangements are still

05:22.890 --> 05:23.957
a little bit in flux...

05:23.991 --> 05:25.125
Let me know when
you get that sorted out.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.760
Look...

05:36.003 --> 05:37.871
Okay, so we got the chair
situation sorted out.

05:37.905 --> 05:39.072
Welcome, everyone,

05:39.106 --> 05:40.908
to the second
first official meeting

05:40.941 --> 05:42.976
of the Brian Finch
Amazing Major Crime Squad.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.445
Question
on the name?

05:44.478 --> 05:45.913
Yeah.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.815
Are you trying
to suggest

05:47.848 --> 05:49.983
that the major crimes
themselves are amazing?

05:50.017 --> 05:52.019
Because the way

05:52.052 --> 05:53.454
you have it worded...

05:53.487 --> 05:54.788
BRIAN: Yeah, no,
that's a good point.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.156
Thanks, James.
Thorough as always.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.425
All right,
let's just call it

05:57.458 --> 06:00.861
the Brian Finch
Major Crime Squad,

06:00.894 --> 06:02.730
Which Is Also Amazing.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.164
You know what?
Doesn't matter.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.066
We're not gonna call it
by its official name, anyway.

06:06.099 --> 06:07.435
We're gonna go by the nickname.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.703
What's the nickname?

06:10.738 --> 06:12.773
The Bruntouchables.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.141
I'm leaving.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.543
Whoa, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

06:15.576 --> 06:16.977
Boyle, come on,
you got your chair.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.145
Can you just give me a second?

06:18.178 --> 06:19.647
Please?

06:19.680 --> 06:20.781
Let's watch the movie.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.149
All right?

06:22.182 --> 06:24.885
Where does the Ten Most Wanted
list come from?

06:24.918 --> 06:27.888
Hmm. Great question.

06:27.921 --> 06:30.023
(old-fashioned accent):
Thomas James Holden
robbed mail trains

06:30.057 --> 06:30.991
throughout the 1920s;

06:31.024 --> 06:32.893
then he was involved
in two different escapes

06:32.926 --> 06:33.861
from Leavenworth prison.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.863
What finally got him for good?

06:35.896 --> 06:38.165
In March 1950,
he was the first fugitive

06:38.198 --> 06:41.001
placed on the brand new
Ten Most Wanted list.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.838
Today, the list is filled
with new kinds of criminals.

06:44.872 --> 06:46.574
There's Susanna Travis,

06:46.607 --> 06:48.476
who convinced her cult of
25 followers to commit suicide,

06:48.509 --> 06:51.645
but skipped on the poison punch
when her turn came.

06:51.679 --> 06:54.181
Luis Cordova Costa,
the cartel gunman

06:54.214 --> 06:56.917
behind a massacre that left
four DEA agents dead.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.019
Gerald Landry,
who headed a Ponzi scheme

06:59.052 --> 07:01.922
that bankrupted retirement
accounts all over the country.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.791
Lawrence Drake
was a brilliant engineer

07:03.824 --> 07:05.793
who killed his wife
with his bare hands.

07:05.826 --> 07:07.027
He built the tunnel
out of Rikers

07:07.060 --> 07:08.996
and escaped
alongside Lonnie Hyde.

07:09.029 --> 07:12.199
Ray Allen Clements went on
a one-night cop murdering spree

07:12.232 --> 07:13.834
in Jersey City
three years ago...

07:13.867 --> 07:14.968
Can we stop this?

07:15.002 --> 07:16.570
We're FBI agents.

07:16.604 --> 07:17.838
We can look at the
Ten Most Wanted list

07:17.871 --> 07:19.740
any time we want to.
Dude.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.241
It's supposed to fire you up,
all right?

07:21.274 --> 07:22.610
And look, check out
the camera work.

07:22.643 --> 07:23.844
That was all in one take.

07:23.877 --> 07:26.947
It was actually
a little showy for my taste.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.182
Look, we are gonna catch
all of these guys.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.519
And Susanna Travis, too.

07:31.552 --> 07:32.686
Sorry, Rebecca,
I didn't mean to suggest

07:32.720 --> 07:34.855
that women can't be

07:34.888 --> 07:36.790
um, horrible criminals, too.

07:36.824 --> 07:38.592
No offense taken.
Great.

07:38.626 --> 07:39.927
Why would we want do this?

07:39.960 --> 07:42.029
There are already people
looking for all these guys.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.864
Why would we do this?

07:43.897 --> 07:46.033
No one has ever swept

07:46.066 --> 07:47.968
the Top Ten list
clean before.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.604
I mean, it would be
an incredible accomplishment.

07:50.638 --> 07:52.706
So how about it?
Huh?

07:52.740 --> 07:54.675
Who's up for some assignments?

07:55.943 --> 07:57.277
So I think
Susanna Travis

07:57.310 --> 07:59.680
is moving between
rural towns in Idaho.

07:59.713 --> 08:00.914
Apparently, she still
attracts followers

08:00.948 --> 08:03.116
in spite of the...
what-have-you.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.118
Your job is to go to
Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.154
I'm going after the cult lady.

08:07.187 --> 08:08.622
BRIAN:
That's right.

08:08.656 --> 08:10.824
Travis' people are known
to recruit from diners

08:10.858 --> 08:12.693
and bus stations...
places like that.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.795
So you should go

08:14.828 --> 08:17.164
and just look
sad, right?

08:17.197 --> 08:18.966
Until someone
approaches you.

08:20.668 --> 08:22.269
"Look sad?"

08:22.302 --> 08:24.137
How am I supposed to do that?

08:26.807 --> 08:27.975
I wouldn't overthink it.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.643
No.
I-I would just
go there and...

08:29.677 --> 08:31.945
do what feels natural.
Sure.

08:34.882 --> 08:35.849
All right,
the boys are here!

08:35.883 --> 08:37.084
So...

08:37.117 --> 08:38.952
who's up for a road trip?

08:38.986 --> 08:40.253
Where we going?

08:40.287 --> 08:41.955
You are going to Costa Rica.

08:41.989 --> 08:43.857
Luis Cordova Costa,

08:43.891 --> 08:45.893
the gunman who shot
down those DEA agents?

08:45.926 --> 08:47.661
When he was working
with the cartels,

08:47.695 --> 08:49.663
he stayed at resorts there
in-between assignments.

08:49.697 --> 08:50.998
I think he may be
staying at one

08:51.031 --> 08:52.733
under a fake name.
Mm-hmm.

08:52.766 --> 08:54.802
And you, my friend,
have the honor of pursuing

08:54.835 --> 08:56.069
kidnapper Gordon Cooke.

08:56.103 --> 08:57.270
Now be careful, okay?

08:57.304 --> 08:58.639
He's a stone bad-ass.

08:58.672 --> 08:59.807
You'll have to stay
on your toes.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.042
Just tell me where to go.

09:02.075 --> 09:04.812
Qaanaaq, Greenland.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.747
Cooke was a survivalist.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.048
We think he may be
living off the land.

09:08.081 --> 09:10.017
So, w-wait a minute.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.319
Mike is going
to Costa Rica...

09:12.352 --> 09:15.889
and I'm flying
to the Arctic Circle?

09:17.190 --> 09:19.092
BOYLE:
Rooks and I are going after
Ray Allen Clements.

09:19.126 --> 09:21.261
If I'm doing this,
I'm gonna get a cop-killer.

09:21.294 --> 09:22.696
Um, okay.

09:22.730 --> 09:23.864
That works. Just make sure...

09:23.897 --> 09:25.265
S-So sorry.

09:25.298 --> 09:27.067
For a second there,
it sounded like

09:27.100 --> 09:29.136
you were about
to give me an order.

09:32.873 --> 09:35.142
You know what you need to do,
right, my friend?

09:35.175 --> 09:37.110
NaГ­.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.916
What was that?

09:42.950 --> 09:44.251
Stavros?

09:44.284 --> 09:46.153
He's a smart guy.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.089
You should hear
his life story.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.858
All right.
Ready to do some work?

09:50.891 --> 09:52.359
(Brian speaks Swahili)

09:57.030 --> 09:58.265
I got John Doe files
from every morgue

09:58.298 --> 09:59.667
that would send them to me.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.135
Some of them have been
missing for a while,

10:02.169 --> 10:03.804
so it stands to reason
they might be dead.

10:05.238 --> 10:06.306
You learning Swahili?

10:06.339 --> 10:07.975
Yeah.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.109
Gerald Landry?

10:09.142 --> 10:11.178
Ponzi scheme guy that went off
the grid two years ago?

10:11.211 --> 10:12.245
He's a big-game hunter.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.147
Of course he is.
I know, right?

10:14.181 --> 10:15.716
Landry has a passion,

10:15.749 --> 10:17.985
and he's got a lot of
stolen money to indulge it.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.052
You think he's
still hunting.

10:19.086 --> 10:20.688
I've been in touch
with park rangers

10:20.721 --> 10:22.289
from every major
big-game country,

10:22.322 --> 10:25.092
and in Tanzania, the amount
of commissioned expeditions

10:25.125 --> 10:27.260
has tripled
in the past two years.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.229
It's almost like
there's a rich guy

10:29.262 --> 10:30.798
with nothing to do.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.332
So I asked the park ranger

10:32.365 --> 10:35.836
to e-mail me a cell phone photo
of the guy.

10:35.869 --> 10:38.405
There's that.

10:38.438 --> 10:39.973
This could be Landry.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.709
Yeah, right?

10:41.742 --> 10:43.210
He would have had a lot
of plastic surgery.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.311
Mm-hmm.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.880
I think you found him.

10:46.914 --> 10:49.416
Well, what do you say we go
to Tanzania and find out?

10:49.449 --> 10:51.719
Oh, you have
to have a visa

10:51.752 --> 10:53.186
and all kinds of shots.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.055
I didn't mean today,
you silly goose.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.224
Today I want
to go Dyker Heights.

10:57.257 --> 10:59.126
REBECCA:
We just started looking

10:59.159 --> 11:00.828
for everyone
on the top ten list,

11:00.861 --> 11:02.095
and you want to talk to
the mistress of the guy

11:02.129 --> 11:03.897
who's number 12?

11:03.931 --> 11:06.800
Okay, Troy Abate, he's number
nine on the list, right?

11:06.834 --> 11:08.368
He dragged
the Trancoso family

11:08.401 --> 11:11.204
into the modern era
by focusing on cyber crime.

11:11.238 --> 11:14.241
And his button man, Paul
Lagravanese, he's number 12.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.743
(phone whistles)

11:15.776 --> 11:17.344
So, they're from
the same crime family,

11:17.377 --> 11:19.479
and there's
a decent chance that one

11:19.512 --> 11:20.914
knows where the other is hiding.

11:20.948 --> 11:23.450
(phone whistles)
(groans)

11:23.483 --> 11:26.153
Sorry, okay, my family
still hasn't seen my place.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.055
So I'm having them all over
for dinner tonight.

11:28.088 --> 11:30.758
And this caterer has become
such a pain in the ass.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.092
since his business took off.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.161
Here, you're gonna want
to take a left up here.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.162
The car has a
navigation system.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.097
Turn left ahead.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.432
Does the car have
an NZT system?

11:39.466 --> 11:41.434
So, once we're in front of
Paul Lagravanese's mistress,

11:41.468 --> 11:43.103
we're just supposed
to politely ask

11:43.136 --> 11:45.105
if she knows
where Troy Abate is?

11:45.138 --> 11:46.139
Uh, no.

11:46.173 --> 11:48.175
We offer to bump Lagravanese

11:48.208 --> 11:50.210
to number 11,
that way

11:50.243 --> 11:51.478
if he rats on Abate,

11:51.511 --> 11:54.481
Lagravanese is moved
into the top ten.

11:54.514 --> 11:56.016
Why would he want that?

11:56.049 --> 11:58.351
Because their whole way
of life is dying.

11:58.385 --> 12:01.021
They're like the Pennsylvania
Dutch at this point.

12:01.054 --> 12:04.858
They just want to feel relevant.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.493
You'll bump Paulie to 11?

12:06.526 --> 12:08.128
That's a guarantee?

12:08.161 --> 12:09.729
Yes, ma'am.

12:11.965 --> 12:13.967
(short laugh)

12:15.969 --> 12:18.806
I'm not saying
I know where he is...

12:18.839 --> 12:20.407
but maybe I could
get him a message.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.442
Thank you.

12:24.011 --> 12:25.946
You live here?

12:25.979 --> 12:27.280
Yeah.

12:27.314 --> 12:29.416
No, seriously, you,
you live here?

12:29.449 --> 12:33.253
Well, I mean,
it's not really mine per se.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.455
The FBI lets me stay here.
I don't know...

12:35.488 --> 12:37.457
Do you have any idea how much
it would cost to buy this place?

12:37.490 --> 12:38.826
To rent it?

12:38.859 --> 12:41.128
Yeah, no.
I mean, you mean,

12:41.161 --> 12:43.330
like, an exact figure?
No, I don't, I don't know.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.232
Why did I go to college?

12:45.265 --> 12:47.167
I already told him
I'm moving in.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.101
That's not happening.

12:48.135 --> 12:49.069
Guys, do you guys
want a glass of wine?

12:49.102 --> 12:51.238
Take your jackets off.
Oh, yes, oh, sorry.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.473
Yes, I'm just a little,
I'm just a little bit

12:53.506 --> 12:55.208
dumbfounded is all.
I can understand.

12:55.242 --> 12:56.276
Well, dinner's almost ready.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.979
I ended up making, uh, quail.

12:59.012 --> 13:00.513
Dad's favorite.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.315
Wha...? You cooked?

13:02.349 --> 13:03.550
BRIAN:
Yes.

13:03.583 --> 13:06.854
You know, it's all basic science
and chemistry anyway, right?

13:06.887 --> 13:08.922
You flunked chemistry.
Yeah.

13:08.956 --> 13:11.324
Well, I aced the quail.
Thanks, Rach.

13:11.358 --> 13:13.360
Cheers.
Cheers.

13:17.330 --> 13:20.367
So, what do you think, Dad?

13:22.269 --> 13:24.271
What do I think?
Mm-hmm.

13:26.940 --> 13:29.076
I think it's a nice
apartment, Brian.

13:29.109 --> 13:30.410
Yeah.

13:32.880 --> 13:35.348
Yeah, and you know, anytime
you guys come into the city,

13:35.382 --> 13:36.183
you can totally stay here.
Oh.

13:36.216 --> 13:38.085
If you want to see
a show or something,

13:38.118 --> 13:40.387
I can get you tickets
to-to-to any show in New York.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.122
Well, I-I hear Hamilton
is wonderful.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.356
Can't get tickets
to Hamilton.

13:43.390 --> 13:44.524
Let's eat.
Okay.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.026
Shall we?
Okay.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.360
Oh, this looks delicious.

13:47.394 --> 13:49.529
Doesn't this look
delicious, Dennis?

13:49.562 --> 13:52.165
BRIAN:
So, obviously something's
bothering Dad.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.400
I added up the number
of one-on-one

13:53.433 --> 13:55.635
interactions
during the evening.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.270
The math is pretty compelling.

13:57.304 --> 13:59.272
Dad and Rachel-- five.

13:59.306 --> 14:01.241
Dad and Cameron-- four.

14:01.274 --> 14:04.144
Mom and Dad--
too many to count.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.046
It wasn't until he left
that I realized

14:06.079 --> 14:07.514
he seemed fine
around everyone else.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.282
Bye, Dad. All right.
Take care, Brian.

14:09.316 --> 14:12.019
What was bothering him was me.

14:12.052 --> 14:14.955
I spent most of last night
hanging around the bus station

14:14.988 --> 14:17.390
at Coeur d'Alene; I thought
it was gonna be a bust,

14:17.424 --> 14:18.992
but then this morning,
a couple came up

14:19.026 --> 14:22.062
and asked if I was looking
for purpose in my life.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.297
They gave me this.

14:24.331 --> 14:26.266
I'm supposed to meet them at
a diner later to discuss it all.

14:26.299 --> 14:28.201
That's great, uh, you know,
ask to see their leader,

14:28.235 --> 14:29.436
and get me an address.

14:29.469 --> 14:30.470
You want to know
the funny thing.

14:30.503 --> 14:33.373
Some of the ideas in here
are not that crazy.

14:33.406 --> 14:37.177
Like I can sabotage myself
with my negative thinking.

14:37.210 --> 14:40.313
Well, James, we want you
to infiltrate the cult.

14:40.347 --> 14:43.316
Not join the cult, all right.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.418
Be careful.
Good luck.

14:48.455 --> 14:51.191
We got one.
What?

14:51.224 --> 14:53.360
Remember Ginnie,
the gum-chewing "goomar"?

14:53.393 --> 14:54.995
Well, she must have
passed off the message

14:55.028 --> 14:56.396
to Paul Lagravanese,

14:56.429 --> 14:58.431
because this morning
I got a text of an address

14:58.465 --> 15:00.900
in Far Rockaway--
guess who we found there.

15:04.972 --> 15:06.473
BRIAN:
Troy Abate!

15:06.506 --> 15:08.441
That's two down,
eight to go.

15:08.475 --> 15:10.277
All right, I got
a question for you.

15:10.310 --> 15:13.113
What do Bill Gates,
Justin Bieber,

15:13.146 --> 15:16.416
Katy Perry, YouTube and Ellen
DeGeneres all have in common?

15:16.449 --> 15:17.484
They're among
the most followed

15:17.517 --> 15:19.419
Twitter accounts
in the whole world.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.321
Last night before
my NZT wore off,

15:21.354 --> 15:22.990
I spent time
getting to know them all.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.557
All five accounts
tweeted out the top ten,

15:24.591 --> 15:26.426
and just this morning,

15:26.459 --> 15:28.261
one of Katy Perry's
followers said

15:28.295 --> 15:30.297
that a guy matching
Lawrence Drake's description,

15:30.330 --> 15:32.632
rented the room above
her father's bakery

15:32.665 --> 15:34.101
in Pelham.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.002
Lawrence Drake?

15:35.035 --> 15:36.970
Yeah, the engineer
who killed his wife

15:37.004 --> 15:38.271
and then broke out of Rikers.

15:38.305 --> 15:39.439
You should see my feed.

15:39.472 --> 15:40.507
Honestly.

15:40.540 --> 15:41.741
Like, all these tweens

15:41.774 --> 15:43.443
are so totally psyched
they caught a bad guy.

15:43.476 --> 15:45.045
(tweens clamoring)

15:45.078 --> 15:47.080
This is it.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.687
You want to knock on the door?

15:54.721 --> 15:57.090
Or I could, you know...

15:57.124 --> 15:58.558
Well, if he's in there

15:58.591 --> 16:01.694
we could always say
we saw him moving around.

16:16.743 --> 16:19.212
Looks like he cleared out.
(phone whistles)

16:19.246 --> 16:20.413
Hey, check this out.

16:21.714 --> 16:24.284
I just got a tweet
from some burner account.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.987
He copied Bill Gates
and Katy Perry.

16:31.791 --> 16:34.994
Yeah, fugitives can have
Twitter accounts, too.

16:40.533 --> 16:41.601
Did you guys know
that the resort that you

16:41.634 --> 16:44.071
sent me to was one of those
Club Bacchanal places?

16:44.104 --> 16:47.440
You know, clothing optional?

16:47.474 --> 16:48.675
Yeah, what did you opt for?

16:48.708 --> 16:52.345
Hey, it's my assign...

16:52.379 --> 16:53.713
Ah!
Oh, keep us pointed

16:53.746 --> 16:54.814
at your face, please.

16:54.847 --> 16:58.651
Ooh! A man matching
Luis Cordova Costa's description

16:58.685 --> 17:02.455
has been seen at a number
of resorts in the San Juan area

17:02.489 --> 17:04.524
over the past few months.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.459
I'm thinking
if I wait here long enough,

17:06.493 --> 17:08.628
he'll come back through.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.263
Are you serious?

17:10.297 --> 17:11.531
I can't even feel my toes.

17:11.564 --> 17:12.432
Ike, buddy,

17:12.465 --> 17:14.167
how you doing?

17:14.201 --> 17:16.369
It's cold.
It's very, very cold.

17:16.403 --> 17:19.672
They've taken me in at some
kind of a research station.

17:19.706 --> 17:22.509
The couple's very nice.
They're Danish, I think.

17:22.542 --> 17:23.810
But they haven't seen anyone

17:23.843 --> 17:25.678
matching Gordon Cook's
description.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.548
They haven't seen anyone
matching any description.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.283
Well, you're walking
a very brave path,

17:30.317 --> 17:32.552
my friend, stick with it--
anything we can do to help?

17:32.585 --> 17:34.221
Tell Mike I said he can go...

17:34.254 --> 17:35.388
Okay.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.491
Nah, he'll be fine.

17:38.525 --> 17:40.527
So, James hasn't been
answering his phone.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.462
So I think we can
all assume he's either

17:42.495 --> 17:45.232
near Susanna Travis' cult
or in Susanna Travis' cult.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.366
What about you guys?

17:46.399 --> 17:50.503
I spent yesterday tracking down
an old C.I. in Jersey.

17:50.537 --> 17:52.205
That's confidential informant.

17:52.239 --> 17:54.441
And if, uh, Ray Allen Clemens
is anywhere

17:54.474 --> 17:56.376
in the tristate area,
their best guess

17:56.409 --> 17:57.477
is he's holed up in Paterson.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.579
Possibly the Parnell Houses.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.548
Which means we can't expect much

18:01.581 --> 18:03.450
in the way of cooperation.
No.

18:03.483 --> 18:06.453
Well, meanwhile, I found myself
a nemesis in Lawrence Drake.

18:06.486 --> 18:08.788
Did you just say your "nemesis"?

18:08.821 --> 18:10.423
Yeah.
Yeah.

18:10.457 --> 18:13.260
You can call him
whatever you want.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.695
But he dropped you
like a hot potato.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.397
You guys got a plan

18:17.430 --> 18:19.432
to pick up his scent?

18:21.568 --> 18:24.337
(sniffing)

18:24.371 --> 18:26.373
(exhales)

18:27.940 --> 18:29.909
You're gonna pick up
the scent by actually

18:29.942 --> 18:31.611
picking up the scent?

18:31.644 --> 18:32.612
Kind of.

18:32.645 --> 18:35.482
You ever heard of synesthesia?

18:35.515 --> 18:38.585
It is a neurological phenomenon
where people

18:38.618 --> 18:42.455
experience their different
senses as colors.

18:43.556 --> 18:44.857
Don't ask me how I know that.

18:44.891 --> 18:46.459
I'm a synesthete.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.828
I see all aromas as colors.

18:48.861 --> 18:51.864
I want you to acknowledge
that you smell like ice blue.

18:51.898 --> 18:54.167
I smell like ice blue--
whoa!

18:54.201 --> 18:56.269
Anyway.

18:56.303 --> 18:57.804
Turns out there's some
real science behind it.

18:57.837 --> 19:00.407
All my senses

19:00.440 --> 19:01.574
are enhanced.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.610
And I can use my whole brain
or whatever

19:03.643 --> 19:05.612
when I'm on NZT, right?

19:05.645 --> 19:07.580
So...

19:07.614 --> 19:10.450
if I can find
whatever part of my brain

19:10.483 --> 19:12.552
makes a synesthete a synesthete,

19:12.585 --> 19:14.387
I can use this
T-shirt we found

19:14.421 --> 19:16.489
in Lawrence Drake's apartment
to actually follow him.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.191
(sniffing)

19:34.474 --> 19:35.775
Huh, sweat,

19:35.808 --> 19:38.711
aftershave, curry.

19:38.745 --> 19:42.549
And a certain je ne sais quoi.

19:42.582 --> 19:46.519
Whatever it is, it's green.

19:46.553 --> 19:49.622
It's working?

19:50.923 --> 19:52.525
What?
Oh, nothing.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.527
I would've just guessed
that you were...

19:54.561 --> 19:56.729
something a little tougher.

19:56.763 --> 19:57.930
Huh.

19:57.964 --> 19:59.232
Why?

20:01.000 --> 20:02.469
What color am I?

20:02.502 --> 20:04.337
Am I pink?

20:04.371 --> 20:06.473
I'm not pink, am I?

20:06.506 --> 20:08.475
It's a drug, isn't it?

20:08.508 --> 20:09.809
Hmm?

20:09.842 --> 20:11.578
All my guys are
trying to figure out

20:11.611 --> 20:13.613
what's up with Brian Finch.

20:14.981 --> 20:17.617
He's wanted for murder and then
he suddenly works for us.

20:17.650 --> 20:20.553
He's a genius,
but only sometimes.

20:20.587 --> 20:22.555
Has to be a drug.

20:22.589 --> 20:23.923
It's the only thing
that makes sense.

20:23.956 --> 20:26.726
I know you can't
say anything.

20:26.759 --> 20:29.996
But... if that's
where the job's heading,

20:30.029 --> 20:33.500
I mean, what, are they
just gonna wind up

20:33.533 --> 20:34.901
feeding us
whatever Finch is on?

20:34.934 --> 20:36.369
If it's a drug...

20:38.070 --> 20:39.672
...we're a long way from that.

20:39.706 --> 20:41.841
But if we keep
feeding him those pills,

20:41.874 --> 20:43.643
what's he gonna be like
even a year from now?

20:43.676 --> 20:44.877
Not something we can control.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.847
We can barely
control him now.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.482
If it's a drug.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.486
If it's a drug.

20:53.520 --> 20:54.954
Hey.

20:54.987 --> 20:56.989
Check it out.

20:57.023 --> 20:59.392
Looks like Michelle Haley.

20:59.426 --> 21:02.061
She had a kid with Clemens.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.596
You don't think he's dumb
enough to actually be hiding

21:03.630 --> 21:05.064
with her, do you?

21:05.097 --> 21:08.468
That dirtbag's been somewhere
since he shot four cops.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.440
Do you ever think
about what it's like?

21:13.473 --> 21:15.007
Taking whatever Finch is on?

21:15.041 --> 21:16.376
How could I not?

21:16.409 --> 21:17.410
I see the kid every day.

21:17.444 --> 21:18.645
But I'd never do it.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.313
Feel that strongly
about it?

21:20.347 --> 21:21.981
Maybe. Maybe I just think

21:22.014 --> 21:23.916
if you took one
of those pills,

21:23.950 --> 21:25.952
I don't see how
you ever stop.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.802
REBECCA:
Yeah.

21:42.835 --> 21:44.837
Thank you very much.

21:44.871 --> 21:47.374
How's it going?

21:47.407 --> 21:49.942
It's interesting.

21:49.976 --> 21:52.645
I mean, it's totally useless
as an investigative technique,

21:52.679 --> 21:53.913
but it is interesting.

21:53.946 --> 21:55.348
I mean, there's a lot
of smells in the world.

21:55.382 --> 21:56.383
Yeah.
Yeah.

21:56.416 --> 21:58.050
He's staying
right over there.

21:59.085 --> 22:02.054
I showed Drake's picture
to the bodega clerk.

22:02.088 --> 22:04.591
Saw him coming out of
there about an hour ago.

22:04.624 --> 22:06.626
It's called being
a detective.

22:07.894 --> 22:09.862
(cell phone rings)

22:09.896 --> 22:11.864
Eau de Lawrence Drake.

22:11.898 --> 22:13.400
Yeah, he is in there.

22:13.433 --> 22:14.634
Hey.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.569
BOYLE: I'm in Jersey, we had
eyes on Ray Allen Clements' ex,

22:16.603 --> 22:18.571
but she tipped him off
we were coming,

22:18.605 --> 22:19.839
and he ran down to the basement.

22:19.872 --> 22:21.073
Called for backup.

22:21.107 --> 22:23.075
But I don't want
to lose Clements.

22:23.109 --> 22:25.745
You may want to come down
and join the party.

22:25.778 --> 22:28.080
I'm on my way.

22:28.114 --> 22:29.749
Casey and Boyle are
at the Parnell Houses.

22:29.782 --> 22:30.750
They need help.

22:30.783 --> 22:32.419
Really?

22:32.452 --> 22:34.086
We can't lose
Lawrence Drake.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.422
Didn't the guy say
he was out?

22:35.455 --> 22:36.756
I'll just wait here.

22:36.789 --> 22:39.426
Seriously, I got this.

22:39.459 --> 22:42.429
If you see him,
call for backup.

22:42.462 --> 22:44.431
BRIAN: Once she was gone,
I spent a little time thinking

22:44.464 --> 22:46.433
about what Boyle
and Casey were up to.

22:46.466 --> 22:48.535
*

23:02.214 --> 23:04.517
I could think
about that all day,

23:04.551 --> 23:06.185
but there was that green trail,

23:06.218 --> 23:08.488
just kind of waiting
to be followed.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.426
*

23:41.020 --> 23:42.655
If I was gonna wait,

23:42.689 --> 23:45.458
I might as well see
what the guy had to say.

23:49.529 --> 23:51.898
So Lawrence Drake
is on the run,

23:51.931 --> 23:54.066
and he's supposedly guilty,

23:54.100 --> 23:55.201
but he has a wall
full of articles

23:55.234 --> 23:56.636
about his wife's murder?

23:59.506 --> 24:02.475
Lawrence Drake pled not guilty,
big surprise,

24:02.509 --> 24:04.477
but he claimed to know
who really killed his wife--

24:04.511 --> 24:06.479
a man in a ski mask,

24:06.513 --> 24:07.614
who Lawrence alleged
was waiting for them

24:07.647 --> 24:09.482
when they got home that night.

24:09.516 --> 24:10.950
There is no evidence
that anyone else was there,

24:10.983 --> 24:12.485
and Lawrence went to jail.

24:12.519 --> 24:14.621
But after he broke out,
he spent all his time

24:14.654 --> 24:17.957
trying to find a way to track
down the man in the ski mask.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.959
He said he was determined
to exonerate himself

24:19.992 --> 24:22.629
before his daughter graduated
from high school.

24:22.662 --> 24:24.631
Does a guilty man do that?

24:24.664 --> 24:25.998
(keys jingle)

24:30.737 --> 24:32.471
I don't want any trouble.

24:34.040 --> 24:37.009
Lawrence, I'm
with the FBI,

24:37.043 --> 24:39.646
and I've got kind of a sucky
situation on my hands.

24:39.679 --> 24:42.982
You were supposed
to be my nemesis.

24:43.015 --> 24:44.984
And now...

24:45.017 --> 24:48.688
I'm, like, 59% sure
you're innocent.

24:51.223 --> 24:52.224
What are we gonna do about that?

24:59.832 --> 25:01.267
REBECCA:
What?

25:01.300 --> 25:03.269
Of course not, no one got
kicked in the face.

25:03.302 --> 25:05.137
BRIAN:
Oh, that's cool, I guess.

25:05.171 --> 25:07.139
Uh, Clements wasn't holed up
with his girlfriend.

25:07.173 --> 25:09.709
We swept the building,
and we found him staying

25:09.742 --> 25:10.977
in a unit whose tenant
died six months ago.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.011
That's amazing.

25:12.044 --> 25:13.179
Three down.

25:13.212 --> 25:14.881
REBECCA: Where did you get
with Lawrence Drake?

25:14.914 --> 25:17.183
Uh, pretty far, actually.

25:17.216 --> 25:18.718
I found him.

25:18.751 --> 25:19.919
Did you bring him in?

25:19.952 --> 25:22.054
I did...

25:22.088 --> 25:24.056
in a manner of speaking.

25:24.090 --> 25:26.593
In a manner of speaking?

25:26.626 --> 25:30.029
Yeah, I kind of don't think
that he killed his wife.

25:30.062 --> 25:31.864
Then bring him in,
and he can prove it.

25:31.898 --> 25:33.866
Yeah, I don't know.

25:33.900 --> 25:34.801
He spent a lot
of years in prison.

25:34.834 --> 25:37.003
He's kind of squirrelly
about authorities.

25:37.036 --> 25:40.106
Are you telling me that you're
on the lam with Lawrence Drake?

25:40.139 --> 25:41.641
Where are you, Brian?

25:41.674 --> 25:43.643
Nowhere you would think
to look for us?

25:43.676 --> 25:44.844
You're at your apartment,
aren't you?

25:44.877 --> 25:46.846
No, of course not.

25:46.879 --> 25:50.316
Listen, before my pill wore off,
we talked a lot,

25:50.349 --> 25:52.318
and I think that I can prove
that he's innocent

25:52.351 --> 25:55.221
and that he didn't do this,
but I need my pill tomorrow.

25:55.254 --> 25:57.223
Do not let him
out of your sight.

25:57.256 --> 25:59.225
If you can make me a believer,
I'll give you your pill,

25:59.258 --> 26:02.194
but if you can't, I'm gonna
arrest the both of you.

26:02.228 --> 26:04.063
(knocking on door)

26:04.096 --> 26:05.632
You expecting someone?

26:06.999 --> 26:08.968
No.

26:09.001 --> 26:10.136
Here, get in the back.

26:11.170 --> 26:12.705
(knocking on door)

26:14.040 --> 26:15.708
(sighs in relief)

26:18.811 --> 26:20.246
Hey.

26:20.279 --> 26:22.114
Rach, what are
you doing here?

26:22.148 --> 26:23.315
We need to talk.

26:23.349 --> 26:25.184
Uh...

26:25.217 --> 26:26.318
All right.

26:26.352 --> 26:27.787
(chain lock rattles)

26:32.759 --> 26:34.994
What, do you want a drink?

26:35.027 --> 26:37.697
Actually, I could really
use a little...

26:40.232 --> 26:43.069
Oh, come on, don't even try to
pretend you don't smoke anymore.

26:43.102 --> 26:45.237
All right.

26:54.013 --> 26:55.114
Breathe clear...
(coughs)

26:55.147 --> 26:56.983
Whoa, man.

26:57.016 --> 26:58.250
You are an amateur.

26:58.284 --> 27:00.252
You know they make
vaporizers, right?

27:00.286 --> 27:01.788
Oh, sure,

27:01.821 --> 27:04.957
but I have a sentimental
attachment to this thing.

27:04.991 --> 27:06.425
All right,
so you wanted to talk.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.660
What's up, Rach?

27:07.694 --> 27:10.997
Well... I noticed last night

27:11.030 --> 27:13.132
that you have surround sound,

27:13.165 --> 27:16.102
and Game of Thrones
is on in 20, so...

27:16.135 --> 27:17.203
Are you serious?

27:17.236 --> 27:18.370
Did you come over here
to raid my stash

27:18.404 --> 27:20.940
and watch my television?
Oh, oh, no, we
can also talk.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.241
Oh, great.
Before it starts.

27:22.274 --> 27:23.242
Not during.

27:23.275 --> 27:24.243
Oh, my God.

27:24.276 --> 27:26.112
(snickers)
You're the worst.

27:26.145 --> 27:27.780
(snorts)
(chuckling):
Oh, my God.

27:27.814 --> 27:29.248
Did you just snort?

27:29.281 --> 27:31.117
This stuff is strong.

27:31.150 --> 27:32.251
Yeah, you want
to know what else?

27:32.284 --> 27:33.786
You picked the worst
night to come over.

27:33.820 --> 27:35.254
You're an accessory
to a crime now.

27:35.287 --> 27:36.288
(laughs)
True story.

27:36.322 --> 27:38.124
It's not a joke. Hey.

27:38.157 --> 27:39.992
I got a question for you.
Mmm.

27:40.026 --> 27:42.862
Did you think Dad was acting
strange last night?

27:42.895 --> 27:44.864
He seemed tense, yeah.

27:44.897 --> 27:48.334
It has to be weird for him
seeing you in this place.

27:48.367 --> 27:51.871
I mean, especially when
just a few months ago,

27:51.904 --> 27:54.173
you were still hitting
him up for rent money.

27:54.206 --> 27:55.407
Yeah.

27:55.441 --> 27:58.945
I think he's still
a little suspicious

27:58.978 --> 28:00.179
about how you got here.

28:00.212 --> 28:03.049
I know, but as long as I'm
working with the FBI,

28:03.082 --> 28:05.017
there's gonna be stuff that
I can't share with you guys.

28:05.051 --> 28:06.485
I get that. Have you tried
talking to him one-on-one?

28:06.518 --> 28:08.487
Yeah, I have, I tried
calling him today,

28:08.520 --> 28:10.790
and, uh, he just sends me
straight to voice mail.

28:10.823 --> 28:13.059
Dad doesn't send
anyone to voice mail.

28:13.092 --> 28:14.193
That is against
his whole policy

28:14.226 --> 28:15.728
(phone line rings)
about how, you know,

28:15.762 --> 28:16.729
he'll always be
there for us.

28:16.763 --> 28:18.064
DENNIS:
This is Dennis Finch.

28:18.097 --> 28:19.799
Leave me a message,
and I'll call you back.

28:19.832 --> 28:22.268
(scoffs)

28:22.301 --> 28:25.204
He totally sent
you to voice mail.

28:25.237 --> 28:26.873
You saw it, right?

28:26.906 --> 28:27.874
(laughs)
It's proof.

28:27.907 --> 28:29.041
That's not
funny at all.

28:29.075 --> 28:30.209
(laughing):
He just...

28:30.242 --> 28:32.211
They've been whispering
a lot lately.

28:32.244 --> 28:34.213
I can only make out
a few words of the language,

28:34.246 --> 28:37.349
but I think they're talking
about resorting to cannibalism.

28:37.383 --> 28:40.252
I'm the new guy-- I mean, who do
you think they're gonna choose?

28:40.286 --> 28:43.055
Ike, do you see
the crates behind you?

28:43.089 --> 28:44.190
The ones labeled "mad"?

28:44.223 --> 28:46.058
That means "food" in Danish.

28:46.092 --> 28:47.526
You are delicious looking,
don't get me wrong,

28:47.559 --> 28:49.395
but I think you've got
a few more days.

28:53.933 --> 28:55.167
(beeps)

28:55.201 --> 28:57.303
Cooke and his accomplices have
taken over the research station.

28:57.336 --> 29:00.206
They're hoping that Ike moves on
before he realizes who they are.

29:00.239 --> 29:01.774
But if they kill him,

29:01.808 --> 29:03.042
they know we'll send
more people after him.
Yeah.

29:03.075 --> 29:03.910
Ike's kind
of dense.

29:03.943 --> 29:05.411
Bottom of his class at Quantico.
(beeps)

29:05.444 --> 29:07.413
Hey, Ike, buddy, we're
gonna send some people

29:07.446 --> 29:09.315
to go take you
to a nice warm sauna.

29:09.348 --> 29:10.850
How's that sound?

29:10.883 --> 29:11.984
Hang in there.

29:12.018 --> 29:13.252
All right, James Tech.

29:13.285 --> 29:15.321
What's the word?

29:15.354 --> 29:16.856
I spent seven hours
with him yesterday.

29:16.889 --> 29:19.325
We unlocked three ovals.

29:19.358 --> 29:22.995
They said that's never happened
with a new initiate on day one.

29:23.029 --> 29:24.964
Congratulations, man.

29:24.997 --> 29:26.833
Hey, remember how we
sent you out there

29:26.866 --> 29:28.935
to catch Susanna Travis?

29:28.968 --> 29:32.805
Ah, they are driving me
to a special place later,

29:32.839 --> 29:35.274
and I have to wear a blindfold.

29:35.307 --> 29:37.509
Great, well, text us the
longitude and latitude.

29:37.543 --> 29:39.478
And please make sure you
don't drink anything.

29:41.848 --> 29:43.983
So Ike has
unwittingly shacked up

29:44.016 --> 29:45.852
with Gordon Cooke
and his wife.

29:45.885 --> 29:47.319
And James is getting close
to Susanna Travis.

29:47.353 --> 29:50.389
You guys brought in
Ray Allen Clements.

29:50.422 --> 29:52.391
Mad props for that,
by the way.

29:52.424 --> 29:53.926
What's next?

29:53.960 --> 29:54.994
Well, Casey and
I were thinking

29:55.027 --> 29:58.064
we'd kind of like a shot
at, uh, Martin Derrickson.

29:58.097 --> 29:59.398
Firebug.

29:59.431 --> 30:01.400
Burnt down dozens of houses
in the tristate area.

30:01.433 --> 30:02.835
Go get him.

30:02.869 --> 30:05.137
And Spelman.

30:06.205 --> 30:07.506
We're halfway home.

30:07.539 --> 30:09.141
Don't pretend like
you're not having fun.

30:12.444 --> 30:16.048
I know, I know, I know...
* I know what you're thinking.

30:16.082 --> 30:17.516
Yes, I would
very much like an update

30:17.549 --> 30:19.485
on the Lawrence Drake situation.

30:19.518 --> 30:21.153
BRIAN: I know,
it's not my best work.

30:21.187 --> 30:22.488
I'm not on NZT.

30:24.190 --> 30:27.393
But... it's an
elevator to space.

30:27.426 --> 30:29.395
I can see that.

30:29.428 --> 30:31.931
At the moment, I'm mostly
concerned about the fact

30:31.964 --> 30:34.333
that you let one of the FBI's
ten most wanted fugitives

30:34.366 --> 30:35.434
just walk away.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.203
What? Lawrence didn't go
anywhere-- he's at my place.

30:37.236 --> 30:38.938
You seriously think
he's gonna stay there?

30:38.971 --> 30:40.239
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

30:40.272 --> 30:43.275
Look, Lawrence is thrilled that
somebody believes he's innocent.

30:43.309 --> 30:45.277
And, all right, if he runs...

30:45.311 --> 30:46.946
He's not gonna run,
he's innocent.

30:46.979 --> 30:48.280
You think.

30:48.314 --> 30:49.615
Even if he didn't kill his wife,

30:49.648 --> 30:51.517
it's still a crime
to escape from prison.

30:51.550 --> 30:54.053
Listen, the guy got
a raw deal, okay?

30:54.086 --> 30:56.055
Lawrence is only on the top ten
list in the first place

30:56.088 --> 30:58.590
because he broke out of jail
with Lonnie Hyde.

30:58.624 --> 31:01.127
Right, Hyde is
a five-time killer.

31:01.160 --> 31:03.262
But Lawrence had to use Hyde's
cell to build the tunnel.

31:03.295 --> 31:05.264
It's the only place
he could dig out.

31:05.297 --> 31:07.099
Look, they're not friends, okay?
They're not allies.

31:07.133 --> 31:10.669
And this has something to do
with a space elevator?

31:10.702 --> 31:13.672
Yes, people have been
trying to figure out

31:13.705 --> 31:14.606
how to build one
for decades.

31:14.640 --> 31:17.409
Lawrence Drake is a
brilliant engineer,

31:17.443 --> 31:21.347
and 15 years ago, he had an idea
for an inflatable elevator.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.049
It would go
12 miles up.

31:23.082 --> 31:25.051
It's basically like
an aircraft carrier,

31:25.084 --> 31:27.186
but the landing strip is right
on the edge of space.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.989
It would make getting out
of the atmosphere way cheaper.

31:30.022 --> 31:31.323
15 years ago.

31:31.357 --> 31:34.026
Why haven't I heard about
an elevator to space?

31:34.060 --> 31:37.163
Lawrence brought the idea
to a guy named Sanjay Dayal.

31:37.196 --> 31:40.366
Uh, he's the CEO
of SD Aerospace.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.368
And Dayal made
him a small offer,

31:42.401 --> 31:43.502
but Lawrence decided
to hold onto it.

31:43.535 --> 31:46.705
And then ten years ago,
they finally figured out a way

31:46.738 --> 31:49.375
to make the canvas strong enough
to build the elevator.

31:49.408 --> 31:51.277
It was an actual possibility.

31:51.310 --> 31:54.280
But the problem was Sanjay Dayal
would have had to pay

31:54.313 --> 31:56.648
an arm and a leg
for that patent now.

31:56.682 --> 31:58.184
And he wouldn't get
credit as the visionary.

31:58.217 --> 31:59.385
Lawrence thinks
that Sanjay Dayal framed him

31:59.418 --> 32:00.352
for his wife's murder.

32:00.386 --> 32:02.721
Uh, he actually thinks
Dayal hired someone

32:02.754 --> 32:04.056
to kill them both.

32:04.090 --> 32:06.158
Every con has a story like this.

32:06.192 --> 32:08.494
Except...
Lawrence Drake has spent

32:08.527 --> 32:10.496
the entire time he's been free

32:10.529 --> 32:12.031
trying to find
his wife's murderer.

32:12.064 --> 32:14.033
He has boxes of records.

32:14.066 --> 32:16.668
Why would he do that
if he killed his wife?

32:16.702 --> 32:18.337
Okay, he doesn't sound guilty,

32:18.370 --> 32:22.208
but how are you gonna
prove he's innocent?

32:22.241 --> 32:24.343
Lawrence has thought about
the events of that night

32:24.376 --> 32:27.346
over and over in his mind
a thousand times,

32:27.379 --> 32:29.515
but it happened nine years ago.

32:29.548 --> 32:32.184
What if we can help him
remember something more?

32:36.355 --> 32:40.759
You want to give NZT... to one
of the FBI's ten most wanted.

32:40.792 --> 32:43.462
We can handcuff him to a chair
if it makes you feel better,

32:43.495 --> 32:47.233
but this is the only way he's
going to uncover something new.

32:47.266 --> 32:49.335
Mr. Drake, I need you
to understand something.

32:49.368 --> 32:52.271
I'm a special agent with the
Federal Bureau of Investigation,

32:52.304 --> 32:54.073
and I am bound by oaths.

32:54.106 --> 32:55.741
If we give you this pill,

32:55.774 --> 32:58.077
it may help you remember
something useful,

32:58.110 --> 32:59.745
and if it doesn't,

32:59.778 --> 33:01.447
I'll take you into custody.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.282
Do you understand?

33:03.315 --> 33:05.551
You say that thing will
give me perfect recall?

33:05.584 --> 33:08.420
Lawrence, it'll do
a lot more than that.

33:08.454 --> 33:11.590
I guess I'll take
my chances.

33:17.229 --> 33:19.231
*

33:31.610 --> 33:33.712
What kind of damn snake oil
did you two just...

33:33.745 --> 33:34.646
(gasps)

33:35.814 --> 33:37.616
Oh.

33:37.649 --> 33:39.318
Oh, mercy.

33:42.154 --> 33:43.189
Oh, mercy.

33:43.222 --> 33:44.323
(gasps)

33:44.356 --> 33:46.024
Does the job, huh?

33:47.759 --> 33:49.595
Oh, ma'am.

33:49.628 --> 33:52.364
You are so beautiful.

33:52.398 --> 33:54.133
It's like

33:54.166 --> 33:56.535
a statue...

33:56.568 --> 33:57.803
came to life in a museum

33:57.836 --> 34:00.806
and started
walking around.

34:00.839 --> 34:03.309
Thank you, Mr. Drake.

34:03.342 --> 34:06.745
SECOND LAWRENCE: Fool,
you better quit wasting time.

34:06.778 --> 34:08.247
These people might
look friendly now,

34:08.280 --> 34:09.348
but if you don't figure out

34:09.381 --> 34:10.482
what happened to Anna,

34:10.516 --> 34:11.750
they gonna be hauling your ass

34:11.783 --> 34:12.584
back to jail.

34:12.618 --> 34:13.619
Think about that night,

34:13.652 --> 34:14.553
Mr. Drake.

34:14.586 --> 34:16.688
I do nothing but think
about that night.

34:16.722 --> 34:18.724
No, not like this.

34:18.757 --> 34:22.561
Tell us what happened
when you got home.

34:22.594 --> 34:24.730
LAWRENCE:
I saw Anna's body first.

34:24.763 --> 34:27.599
He-he was on me before

34:27.633 --> 34:29.501
I could get to her.

34:30.602 --> 34:32.338
BRIAN:
Tell us about it.

34:32.371 --> 34:33.705
Hear it all.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.574
Smell it all.

34:35.607 --> 34:37.176
Feel it all.

34:37.209 --> 34:38.877
We just fought.

34:38.910 --> 34:41.647
He was on top of me.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.482
The he heard

34:43.515 --> 34:45.117
the neighbors knocking.
(pounding)

34:45.151 --> 34:46.352
And he ran.

34:47.353 --> 34:48.654
Whoa,

34:48.687 --> 34:51.157
oh, wait a minute.

34:51.190 --> 34:52.758
I've got my hands
on his face.

34:52.791 --> 34:54.460
REBECCA:
What did it feel like?

34:54.493 --> 34:56.128
I can feel the mask.

34:56.162 --> 34:58.530
Underneath that,

34:58.564 --> 35:00.366
I feel his cheekbones,

35:00.399 --> 35:02.468
his jaw, his nose.

35:02.501 --> 35:04.870
I can feel what
he looked like.

35:04.903 --> 35:07.273
His whole bone structure.

35:07.306 --> 35:10.742
I can practically see it.

35:10.776 --> 35:13.479
Is-is-is...

35:13.512 --> 35:16.148
s there anything
I can work with? Uh...

35:16.182 --> 35:17.516
Do you want some clay?

35:17.549 --> 35:18.750
You are absolutely
in the right place

35:18.784 --> 35:20.352
if you want some clay.

35:20.386 --> 35:23.589
What exactly
am I looking at here?

35:23.622 --> 35:26.458
A man named Lawrence Drake
made that.

35:26.492 --> 35:29.728
You know what, personally,

35:29.761 --> 35:32.198
I prefer a little more detail
in my artwork.

35:32.231 --> 35:33.665
Oh, yeah?

35:33.699 --> 35:35.301
Well, he did it
by sense of touch.

35:35.334 --> 35:36.602
And when we ran it through
facial recognition software,

35:36.635 --> 35:38.837
we found someone

35:38.870 --> 35:41.373
who had
14 matching attribute points.

35:42.408 --> 35:43.809
That's you,

35:43.842 --> 35:44.876
Philip Brubaker.

35:44.910 --> 35:46.945
REBECCA:
For 20 years,

35:46.978 --> 35:48.780
you made a very nice living
committing murders

35:48.814 --> 35:49.715
for various corporations.

35:49.748 --> 35:52.318
You two gonna come around
to something?

35:52.351 --> 35:53.752
We would like you to admit
that a man named

35:53.785 --> 35:55.721
Sanjay Dayal hired you

35:55.754 --> 35:57.223
to kill Anna
and Lawrence Drake.

35:57.256 --> 35:59.725
We would like you to admit
that you killed Anna

35:59.758 --> 36:00.826
but fled

36:00.859 --> 36:03.229
before you got a chance
to do the same to Lawrence.

36:03.262 --> 36:05.631
Could be we're gonna be here
for a long time,

36:05.664 --> 36:07.666
if you expect me
to say something like that.

36:07.699 --> 36:09.668
You're serving two consecutive
life sentences.

36:09.701 --> 36:10.769
What do you have to lose?

36:10.802 --> 36:13.439
What do I have to gain?

36:13.472 --> 36:14.906
What do you want?

36:14.940 --> 36:16.908
You know what,

36:16.942 --> 36:18.410
I think I got
about everything I need,

36:18.444 --> 36:19.878
so thanks and, uh...

36:19.911 --> 36:21.347
Your accent,
you're from Coney Island, right?

36:21.380 --> 36:23.515
Yeah.

36:23.549 --> 36:25.751
So you got to know
Murray's Bagels.

36:25.784 --> 36:27.619
I mean, they're amazing bagels.

36:27.653 --> 36:28.654
Everyone knows Murray's.

36:28.687 --> 36:32.224
What are you, like,
an everything kind of guy?

36:34.393 --> 36:35.627
Pumpernickel.

36:37.429 --> 36:41.367
NAZ: He admitted to murder
in exchange for a dozen bagels?

36:41.400 --> 36:42.801
Uh, a dozen bagels a week,

36:42.834 --> 36:44.503
and you'll be getting my
bill for reimbursement.

36:44.536 --> 36:46.905
You know, Drake still
broke out of prison.

36:46.938 --> 36:48.740
That comes with a lot of time.

36:48.774 --> 36:50.008
We were thinking about that.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.710
If we agree to work with him,

36:51.743 --> 36:53.712
he will give us the whereabouts
of Lonnie Hyde,

36:53.745 --> 36:55.614
the killer he broke
out of prison with.

36:55.647 --> 36:57.683
Lawrence Drake is innocent,

36:57.716 --> 36:59.918
and he spent
a lot of time in jail.

36:59.951 --> 37:01.787
I'm gonna talk
to Judge Carpenter.

37:01.820 --> 37:03.822
I see no reason
why he can't be remanded

37:03.855 --> 37:06.325
to a white-collar facility
pending a release

37:06.358 --> 37:07.893
based on time served.

37:07.926 --> 37:09.795
BRIAN:
And before we take him,

37:09.828 --> 37:12.030
he wants to have dinner
with his daughter.

37:12.063 --> 37:13.932
I mean, that girl has spent
the past decade

37:13.965 --> 37:15.467
thinking that Lawrence
murdered her mother.

37:18.337 --> 37:20.572
So...

37:20.606 --> 37:22.774
Ike got Gordon Cooke.

37:22.808 --> 37:25.977
Casey and Boyle brought in
Ray Allen Clements.

37:26.011 --> 37:29.948
James found the location
of Susannah Travis' compound.

37:29.981 --> 37:32.818
Rebecca found Perry Granger,
Troy Abate.

37:32.851 --> 37:34.620
We're about to get Lonnie Hyde,

37:34.653 --> 37:35.954
and we found Lawrence Drake.

37:35.987 --> 37:37.856
NAZ: Oh, you didn't apprehend
Lawrence Drake.

37:37.889 --> 37:39.891
He's innocent.
(scoffs)
What?!

37:39.925 --> 37:40.926
We still found him.

37:40.959 --> 37:42.828
What, are you gonna ding us
on a technicality?

37:42.861 --> 37:44.496
All right, you can count him.

37:44.530 --> 37:46.932
But unfortunately,
the hunt is over.

37:48.434 --> 37:50.436
I have every agent
in this building

37:50.469 --> 37:51.870
asking me if they can get
in on it,

37:51.903 --> 37:53.805
and, uh, D.C. called

37:53.839 --> 37:55.674
to tell me that the CJC

37:55.707 --> 37:58.544
is not authorized
as a fugitive-hunting outfit.

37:58.577 --> 38:00.912
So, it's over.

38:00.946 --> 38:02.648
But, Brian, you've
done very, very well.

38:02.681 --> 38:04.850
And, um,

38:04.883 --> 38:07.886
I think we can come
to some sort of accommodation

38:07.919 --> 38:09.388
on your, um...

38:11.523 --> 38:13.759
...headquarters.

38:13.792 --> 38:16.027
Oh, yeah, headquarters.

38:16.061 --> 38:17.629
(phone chirps)

38:17.663 --> 38:18.997
Oh, hey.

38:19.030 --> 38:19.798
Look at that.

38:19.831 --> 38:21.867
It's the park ranger
in Tanzania.

38:21.900 --> 38:23.935
Uh, they caught
our big game hunter,

38:23.969 --> 38:25.437
and his extradition flight
lands tonight.

38:25.471 --> 38:26.772
What do you say we go bag

38:26.805 --> 38:28.340
our last trophy?

38:28.374 --> 38:30.842
("Father to Son" by Queen
playing)

38:30.876 --> 38:33.945
* A word in your ear

38:33.979 --> 38:36.848
* From father to son...

38:36.882 --> 38:39.084
The way I see it,
the point isn't whether or not

38:39.117 --> 38:41.387
they put headquarters
on the window,

38:41.420 --> 38:42.721
which they didn't.

38:42.754 --> 38:45.357
They put H.Q.,
no exclamation point,

38:45.391 --> 38:46.892
which is kind of lame.

38:46.925 --> 38:48.894
But the point is

38:48.927 --> 38:50.095
the Bruntouchables,
when called upon,

38:50.128 --> 38:51.830
were ready,
and we should stay ready,

38:51.863 --> 38:54.366
because as soon as James
get out of de-programming,

38:54.400 --> 38:56.034
the world might call
on us again.

38:56.067 --> 38:57.002
Um...
Mm-hmm?

38:57.035 --> 38:58.470
Sorry, just a quick question.

38:58.504 --> 38:59.605
Yeah?

38:59.638 --> 39:01.039
It's only curiosity,

39:01.072 --> 39:03.942
but what did Stavros do?

39:03.975 --> 39:05.977
Stavros, you ready?

39:08.514 --> 39:10.849
He was a tailor
in the old country.

39:11.683 --> 39:13.652
He made us all T-shirts.

39:13.685 --> 39:15.454
* Funny

39:15.487 --> 39:19.725
* You don't hear
a single word I say *

39:19.758 --> 39:21.627
(laughs)

39:21.660 --> 39:24.963
* But my letter to you

39:26.164 --> 39:28.934
(knocking)

39:28.967 --> 39:31.002
Dad?

39:31.036 --> 39:32.070
Hey.

39:32.103 --> 39:33.004
Hey.

39:33.038 --> 39:34.906
I wanted to call first,

39:34.940 --> 39:37.809
but your sister suggested
I just stop by.

39:37.843 --> 39:39.878
Yeah, come on in.

39:44.750 --> 39:46.952
Rachel said that, uh,

39:46.985 --> 39:49.755
that you thought
that I've been avoiding you.

39:49.788 --> 39:51.523
Oh, well, no.

39:51.557 --> 39:52.824
I didn't say that exact...

39:52.858 --> 39:54.059
I have.

39:54.092 --> 39:55.961
You see, I don't know how

39:55.994 --> 39:57.663
to have a relationship
with you

39:57.696 --> 39:59.731
if I don't know anything real
that's going on in your life.

40:01.733 --> 40:03.502
What is this?

40:03.535 --> 40:06.071
It's just some things
I've kept over the years.

40:06.104 --> 40:08.073
Stuff that you've given me.

40:08.106 --> 40:10.008
Some parents collect

40:10.041 --> 40:11.710
their kids'

40:11.743 --> 40:13.445
self portraits

40:13.479 --> 40:14.880
or straight-A report cards.

40:14.913 --> 40:16.582
This is what I've kept.

40:16.615 --> 40:18.116
What?

40:18.149 --> 40:19.685
That's the drawing

40:19.718 --> 40:21.119
you made for me when
you got kicked out

40:21.152 --> 40:23.121
of McAllister in
the fourth grade.

40:23.154 --> 40:25.090
I didn't understand
how you could cheat

40:25.123 --> 40:26.958
off Sammy Parver's
geography exam,

40:26.992 --> 40:27.893
so you made this diagram

40:27.926 --> 40:30.228
showing me where you sat
and where Sammy sat.

40:30.261 --> 40:31.630
Right.

40:34.566 --> 40:37.035
That's the mobile that
you made to explain to me

40:37.068 --> 40:38.837
how you stole money

40:38.870 --> 40:40.238
from the rest of the kids
in the sixth grade.

40:40.271 --> 40:41.973
It wasn't stealing.

40:42.007 --> 40:43.174
It was a bartering system.

40:43.208 --> 40:44.543
Ah.

40:44.576 --> 40:47.045
Yeah.

40:47.078 --> 40:50.048
I guess I've always been
arts and craftsy, huh?

40:50.081 --> 40:51.249
I don't understand.

40:51.282 --> 40:54.085
Why-why are you giving
all this to me now?

40:54.119 --> 40:56.021
Because I don't
want them anymore.

40:59.525 --> 41:01.693
You always told me the truth.

41:01.727 --> 41:03.729
No matter what kind
of trouble you were in,

41:03.762 --> 41:04.963
you never lied to me.

41:04.996 --> 41:06.164
(sighs)

41:06.197 --> 41:08.534
I loved you for that.

41:10.235 --> 41:11.837
I love you, Dad,

41:11.870 --> 41:14.506
but this time,

41:14.540 --> 41:17.709
it is dangerous
if I tell you the truth.

41:17.743 --> 41:20.078
I don't care.

41:21.312 --> 41:22.814
I would suffer for you.

41:22.848 --> 41:24.049
I would die for you.

41:26.084 --> 41:28.787
You're my son.

41:28.820 --> 41:30.856
You're my Brian.

41:31.857 --> 41:34.259
(sighs)

41:37.262 --> 41:40.031
There is a drug.

41:41.032 --> 41:43.101
You're right about that.

41:45.103 --> 41:47.939
Okay.

41:47.973 --> 41:51.109
There is a drug.

41:52.944 --> 41:55.080
And it's called NZT.

41:55.113 --> 41:58.216
* Joyful the sound

41:58.249 --> 42:01.286
* The word goes around

42:01.319 --> 42:04.055
* From father to son

42:04.089 --> 42:05.991
* To son...

42:06.024 --> 42:07.859
We are dealing
with an engineered virus.

42:07.893 --> 42:09.260
That's right, a second one.

42:09.294 --> 42:11.196
Our only chance
is to find patient zero

42:11.229 --> 42:12.831
within 24 hours.

42:12.864 --> 42:14.132
Break!

42:14.165 --> 42:16.668
If these readings
are correct,

42:16.702 --> 42:18.970
this virus could wipe out
all of New York.

42:19.004 --> 42:20.572
We got to find that monkey.

42:21.339 --> 42:22.941
We traced the virus
that hit New York

42:22.974 --> 42:24.776
to a lab owned by the Triads.

42:24.810 --> 42:25.944
But we'll need Naz's help

42:25.977 --> 42:27.278
if we're gonna infiltrate
their base.

42:27.312 --> 42:29.581
You've never given up
on anything in your life.

42:29.615 --> 42:30.816
Don't give up on me now!

42:30.849 --> 42:32.918
Fight! Fight!

42:32.951 --> 42:34.219
Fight!
Brian!

42:34.252 --> 42:35.220
She's gone.

42:35.253 --> 42:36.321
It's over.

42:36.354 --> 42:39.190
Damn you, Spelman Boyle!

42:39.224 --> 42:40.592
We're gonna get revenge

42:40.626 --> 42:42.027
on the people who killed Naz

42:42.060 --> 42:43.595
by taking down their entire
prostitution ring!

42:47.065 --> 42:49.034
You ready?

42:49.067 --> 42:52.070
I better get a promotion
for this.

42:54.272 --> 42:55.941
REBECCA: Congratulations

42:55.974 --> 42:57.275
on your promotion
to director, Mike.

42:57.308 --> 42:58.744
Thanks, guys.

42:58.777 --> 43:01.279
Just one more thing.

43:01.312 --> 43:03.615
We're the Muntouchables now.

43:03.649 --> 43:06.117
Mike, no!

43:06.151 --> 43:08.854
* From father to son

43:08.887 --> 43:10.188
* To son

43:10.221 --> 43:13.024
* Joyful the sound,
the word goes around. *
