I met this girl on Instagram.

00:07.824 --> 00:08.990
They need a manager like me.

00:08.992 --> 00:10.062
Unless you get her hooked

00:10.064 --> 00:11.692
on drugs like you did Mary.

00:11.693 --> 00:13.361
Mama, we was just at the club.

You got to submit a demo,

If you want to manage us,

00:23.072 --> 00:23.950
show me the money.

00:23.952 --> 00:25.373
I need a job, I need something.

00:26.743 --> 00:28.376
along with instructions.

00:28.378 --> 00:30.177
I do know you got to
tell them girls the truth

00:30.179 --> 00:31.012
about you and Mary.

00:31.014 --> 00:33.381
- I want Mama.
- Mama's dead.

05:23.639 --> 05:25.205
I'm Star. We sing together.

05:25.207 --> 05:26.740
We're in a group.

05:26.742 --> 05:28.542
- There's three of us.
- My sister's in it,

05:28.544 --> 05:30.044
too, but she's not here right now.

05:30.046 --> 05:33.080
She's at church, praying for our Grammy.

05:33.082 --> 05:35.616
She can sing her ass off, trust me.

05:35.618 --> 05:37.685
Her sister can, too.
We're about to do our first demo.

05:37.687 --> 05:39.119
I want you to produce it.

05:39.121 --> 05:40.821
I would, but I got to
go out of town tomorrow.

05:40.823 --> 05:42.323
I'm going on tour.

Oh, that's perfect.
Tomorrow works for us.

05:43.826 --> 05:45.225
We got a deadline anyway.

05:45.227 --> 05:47.127
- Deadline?
- We're entering

05:47.129 --> 05:49.196
the Atlanta Next Best. We
only have two more days.

05:49.198 --> 05:51.398
Oh, so you just so happened

05:51.400 --> 05:54.401
to bump into me at the club tonight.

05:54.403 --> 05:57.271
Maybe we can work something out.

05:57.273 --> 05:58.739
- All right.
- I think that's a yes. Can I get

05:58.741 --> 05:59.873
- a selfie?
- Hold up. In a minute.

05:59.875 --> 06:01.408
Oh.

06:01.410 --> 06:03.377
That was my personal space.

06:03.379 --> 06:05.212
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- We got this.

06:07.283 --> 06:09.049
Why ain't she calling me back?

06:09.051 --> 06:10.918
She thinks you're mad at her.

06:10.920 --> 06:12.753
Well, now I am.

06:14.523 --> 06:15.923
I'll call the bitch.

06:15.925 --> 06:17.558
She ain't gonna bounce a call on me.

06:17.560 --> 06:20.060
Are you the mother?

06:20.062 --> 06:23.097
Yes, I am.

06:23.099 --> 06:25.099
She was in cardiac arrest, but

06:25.101 --> 06:27.101
we successfully resuscitated her.

06:27.103 --> 06:28.969
Thank you, Jesus.

06:28.971 --> 06:32.206
Any idea of where she
got ahold of those drugs?

06:32.208 --> 06:35.642
No, I have no idea, but I'll find out.

06:35.644 --> 06:37.444
- When can I see her?
- The next

06:37.446 --> 06:39.813
24 hours will be critical,
so we're admitting her

06:39.815 --> 06:42.349
in the hospital for further observation.

06:42.351 --> 06:44.418
The nurse'll let you know
when you can see her.

06:48.858 --> 06:52.126

my house again, we are done.

06:55.297 --> 06:57.264
Hi, you.

06:57.266 --> 07:01.101
- Man.
- Man, I figured you was dead or in prison.

07:01.103 --> 07:03.303
Not yet. Hey, congratulations, man.

07:03.305 --> 07:05.572
It looks like business is booming.

07:05.574 --> 07:07.908
Yeah, well, I can't complain.

07:07.910 --> 07:09.376

07:09.378 --> 07:10.844

07:13.949 --> 07:16.950
Don't come in here
asking me for any money.

07:16.952 --> 07:18.786

- Hey, man, it's nothing like that.

07:18.788 --> 07:20.254
Check it out.

07:20.256 --> 07:22.089

07:22.091 --> 07:24.191

07:26.529 --> 07:30.230

you were a P.A., huh?

07:45.781 --> 07:48.415
So don't act like I never
did you a solid before.

07:48.417 --> 07:50.617

07:55.324 --> 07:57.057
I ain't looking for a handout.

07:57.059 --> 07:59.927
I'm asking for your help.

08:02.498 --> 08:04.164
Who you done robbed, man?

08:09.472 --> 08:11.605
All right.

08:11.607 --> 08:13.073
I got a client

08:13.075 --> 08:14.741

08:14.766 --> 08:16.844

Simone.

08:31.527 --> 08:32.659
Brown.

08:32.660 --> 08:34.861
Age 16.

08:34.864 --> 08:36.263
Frequent drug use.

08:36.265 --> 08:38.631
Any history of psychiatric problems?

08:38.634 --> 08:40.567
I don't think so, no.

08:40.568 --> 08:43.135
You don't think so.

08:43.138 --> 08:45.973
She's a teenager. They... they all crazy.

08:45.975 --> 08:47.441
Well, we're trying to determine

08:47.443 --> 08:51.111
if this was an overdose
or a suicide attempt.

08:51.113 --> 08:52.846
She has been waking up having nightmares.

08:52.848 --> 08:54.781
Waking up screaming and stuff.

08:54.783 --> 08:57.618
I'll need to make a copy

08:57.620 --> 09:00.320
I don't have insurance right now.

09:00.322 --> 09:02.022

09:02.024 --> 09:04.725
is going to cost over $5,000.

09:04.727 --> 09:07.361

very affordable options

09:09.832 --> 09:12.199

Big Boi to produce our demo.

been calling you all night.

Why do you have my sister's
phone? Where's Simone?

09:34.423 --> 09:36.990
Hello? Please, where's my sister?

09:36.992 --> 09:39.326
- Ma'am, you're gonna have to calm down.
- I need to know where...

09:39.328 --> 09:40.994
- Is she back there?
- Calm down. Lower your voice.

09:40.996 --> 09:43.130
Excuse me. Where is my sister?
Her name is Simone.

09:43.132 --> 09:44.932
She's 16. She swallowed a bunch of pills.

09:44.934 --> 09:47.301
Yes. She is stable now. We have
her admitted to the hospital tonight.

09:47.303 --> 09:48.736
Okay, she's back there?
'Cause I need to go see right now.

09:48.760 --> 09:50.911
One person allowed back
there, and her mother

09:50.913 --> 09:51.949

09:51.950 --> 09:54.572

11:25.919 --> 11:28.586
and you will, too,
if you keep doing this.

11:28.588 --> 11:30.388
You need to get it together.

11:32.358 --> 11:35.326
I can't lose you like I lost her.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.528
It took me too long to find you.

11:40.282 --> 11:44.017
We can be like those real-life
stories, you know?

11:44.955 --> 11:47.956
The ones that inspire people.

11:49.375 --> 11:52.109
We're gonna be on
Good Morning, America

11:52.111 --> 11:53.945
when we're famous.

11:58.888 --> 12:01.419
Tell me about the contest.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.321
Forget about the contest, Simone.

12:03.323 --> 12:06.023
It's over.

12:06.025 --> 12:08.192
Why? Because of me?

12:08.194 --> 12:10.127
Stop it, Simone.

12:10.129 --> 12:13.331
No. I'm not gonna stop it.
That song's really dope.

12:13.333 --> 12:16.267
You just OD'd, bitch.

12:18.171 --> 12:19.704
I hate hospitals.

12:19.706 --> 12:20.807
Put it back in.

12:20.832 --> 12:22.206
You need to stop it.

12:22.208 --> 12:23.541
- No.
- You can't leave.

12:23.543 --> 12:26.077
Simone, stop.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.179
What if they figure out who I am?

12:28.181 --> 12:30.348
What if they figure out what we did?

12:30.350 --> 12:31.949
You really don't think

12:31.951 --> 12:34.585
nobody's gonna come up
in here looking for us?

12:43.162 --> 12:46.230
How long you been sitting here?

12:46.232 --> 12:48.866
A little while.

12:53.339 --> 12:54.839
How is Simone?

12:54.841 --> 12:58.075
Simone is good.

12:58.077 --> 13:01.846
So why you look so sad, baby?

13:01.848 --> 13:04.382
I've been thinking about Matthew 13.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.684
These girls, Bobby.

13:06.686 --> 13:09.153
These girls ain't got no roots.

13:09.155 --> 13:11.822
They ain't got no religion.

13:11.824 --> 13:14.158
I can't go back and undo all that.

13:18.965 --> 13:22.166
Now, look at us.

13:22.168 --> 13:24.902
We didn't have no roots either.

13:24.904 --> 13:26.938
Somehow...

13:26.940 --> 13:29.206
we found our way.

13:29.208 --> 13:32.109
Simone is one thing,

13:32.111 --> 13:34.378
but Star, I don't know.

13:34.380 --> 13:37.915
Yeah, but they just got here.

13:37.917 --> 13:40.751
Go easy, give 'em a minute.

13:42.088 --> 13:43.387
Yeah.

13:43.389 --> 13:47.425
Well, I should get back to the hospital.

14:03.776 --> 14:05.209
Damn, I hope she forgive me.

14:05.211 --> 14:06.477
Carlotta?

14:06.479 --> 14:08.412
Y'all are ride or die.

14:08.414 --> 14:11.015
You know that little
crazy-eyed girl stole my candy.

14:11.017 --> 14:14.251
- Hello?
- But she gonna be all right.

14:14.253 --> 14:16.587
I'm looking for Star.

14:16.589 --> 14:19.590
Oh, my God, bitch,
there go Hunter Morgan.

14:20.793 --> 14:23.094
Come here.

14:23.096 --> 14:25.463
If y'all don't get into it:

14:25.465 --> 14:27.164
35 touchdowns,

14:27.166 --> 14:28.699
68% completion rate.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.568
It's over for you. You turning it.

14:30.570 --> 14:33.070
And since when you
started watching football?

14:33.072 --> 14:36.273
Since his fine ass became quarterback.

14:37.844 --> 14:40.444
Please don't tell me
you're messing with Star.

14:40.446 --> 14:42.947
- Not yet.
- Ugh.

14:42.949 --> 14:45.016
Girl won't return my phone calls.

14:45.018 --> 14:47.018
Let me tell you something.

14:47.020 --> 14:50.287
Star way too complicated
for a man like you.

14:50.289 --> 14:51.889
I see you with a more agreeable

14:51.891 --> 14:54.725
Asian-type girl.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.360
Star ain't here.

14:56.362 --> 14:58.362
They at the hospital with her sister.

14:58.364 --> 14:59.697
Which hospital?

14:59.699 --> 15:01.532
Midtown General.

15:01.534 --> 15:03.534
Okay, thank you.

15:03.536 --> 15:05.856
Simone's ready to go.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.139
Who are you?

15:08.141 --> 15:10.041
I'm Dr. Klein, the on-call psychiatrist.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.876
You're a shrink?

15:11.878 --> 15:13.677
She doesn't need a shrink.

15:13.679 --> 15:15.379
She's a pothead, end of story.

15:15.381 --> 15:16.914
It's, uh, it's more than pot.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.849
We think this may have
been a suicide attempt.

15:18.851 --> 15:20.084
But it wasn't.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.552
She feels great.

15:21.554 --> 15:23.954
She hates it here and she'd
like to leave, cool?

15:23.956 --> 15:25.356
Just to be on the safe side,

15:25.358 --> 15:27.158
I'm ordering a 72-hour psych hold.

15:27.160 --> 15:30.061
A psych hold?

15:30.063 --> 15:32.363
Could you give us a moment, please?

15:32.365 --> 15:35.833
Thank you.

15:35.835 --> 15:38.702
What did you tell them?
Because let me remind you,

15:38.704 --> 15:41.205
you are not our mother,
you barely know us.

15:41.207 --> 15:43.707
Well, I'm the closest thing
she has to a mother right now.

15:43.709 --> 15:45.443
I'm trying to do the best for her.

15:45.445 --> 15:48.946
Since when?

15:48.948 --> 15:51.115
You gave us up.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.784
They used us for free government checks,

15:53.786 --> 15:56.921
free babysitting, free sex.

15:56.923 --> 15:59.156
That man is a doctor.

15:59.158 --> 16:01.559
Do you know what's gonna happen
if he finds out she's a minor

16:01.561 --> 16:02.960
and I'm not her legal guardian?

16:02.962 --> 16:06.764
I'm tired of your speeches.

16:06.766 --> 16:10.000
You were our mother's best friend.

16:10.002 --> 16:13.170
You should have been there for us then.

16:16.075 --> 16:18.709
Star.

16:18.711 --> 16:20.711
Good news. I got you some studio time

16:20.713 --> 16:22.179
tonight at my friend Conny's.

16:22.181 --> 16:23.714
Tonight?

16:23.716 --> 16:26.517
Uh, could we do it tomorrow maybe?

16:26.519 --> 16:27.885
Demo's due tomorrow.

16:27.887 --> 16:30.454
Wait, this don't even sound like you.

16:30.456 --> 16:31.922
No, no, it's all good.

16:31.924 --> 16:34.892
I just sound better during the day.

16:34.894 --> 16:36.827
You're kidding me, right?

16:36.829 --> 16:39.463
Look, Hurt Park Studios at 8:00.

16:39.465 --> 16:42.466
I'll text you the address.
An engineer will meet you.

16:42.468 --> 16:44.068
Where are you gonna be?

16:44.070 --> 16:45.269
I got some errands to run,

16:45.271 --> 16:46.670
then I'm gonna meet you there.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.739
And look, Star,
this guy's a buddy of mine.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.407
All right? So no shenanigans.

16:50.409 --> 16:53.210
- I'm fresh out of shenanigans.
- Good.

16:53.212 --> 16:55.579
'Cause every minute in that
studio's costing me plenty.

16:55.581 --> 16:57.014
I got to go.

17:00.997 --> 17:02.620
What are you doing here?

17:02.622 --> 17:05.156
I heard your sister wasn't feeling well.

17:05.157 --> 17:07.090
These are for her.

17:07.093 --> 17:08.925
And how'd you find me?

17:08.928 --> 17:10.895
I went by the salon and looked for you.

17:11.945 --> 17:13.979
Most girls come when I call.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.800
Well, A, I've been busy, clearly.

17:17.803 --> 17:20.069
B, I'm not most girls,

17:20.071 --> 17:22.272
and C, you're gonna have to do

17:22.275 --> 17:24.441
a lot more than call to make me come.

17:25.810 --> 17:27.711
Why are you making this so difficult?

17:27.713 --> 17:29.171
'Cause I'm not trying to be some WAG.

17:29.195 --> 17:30.948
Well, maybe that's what I like about you.

17:30.950 --> 17:32.183
So it's not my ass?

17:32.185 --> 17:33.784
Let me take you out.

17:34.654 --> 17:35.953
Maybe.

17:37.089 --> 17:38.622
Maybe.

17:38.624 --> 17:40.791
Thanks for the flowers.

17:42.295 --> 17:44.562
Yeah. You're welcome.

17:49.931 --> 17:51.564
Simone.

17:53.201 --> 17:55.701
How you doing?

18:08.716 --> 18:11.217
Is it true you tried to kill yourself?

18:11.219 --> 18:14.153
No.

18:14.155 --> 18:16.055
They're wrong about me.

18:16.057 --> 18:18.691
I didn't try to kill myself.

18:21.829 --> 18:23.496
I believe you.

18:24.599 --> 18:28.567
You know that white light thing?

18:28.569 --> 18:30.102
Mm-hmm.

18:31.839 --> 18:34.974
I think I believe it, 'cause...

18:34.976 --> 18:37.243
'cause when I, I went to the other side,

18:37.245 --> 18:41.647
I... I think I saw my mom.

18:44.052 --> 18:49.155
I... I believe in angels, but...

18:50.491 --> 18:54.326
...I don't know if I believe in God.

18:54.328 --> 18:57.930
God saved my life

18:57.955 --> 19:00.570
just the way He saved yours.

19:03.204 --> 19:05.971
When you hit rock bottom,

19:05.973 --> 19:08.974
that's when God shows up the most.

19:08.976 --> 19:12.912
He showed up for you and kept you alive.

19:18.986 --> 19:21.620
I just want you to talk to somebody.

19:21.622 --> 19:24.657
Doesn't have to be me.

19:25.760 --> 19:28.694
Just talk to somebody.

19:32.266 --> 19:34.900
I've been through this with my mom.

19:34.902 --> 19:39.138
The whole codependent mess.

19:39.140 --> 19:41.507
No one can make somebody get sober.

19:41.509 --> 19:43.776
They have to want it.

19:43.778 --> 19:45.644
And even if they do,

19:45.646 --> 19:47.913
sometimes it just doesn't work.

19:47.915 --> 19:51.784
Maybe you should move back to New York.

19:51.786 --> 19:54.253
Finish Julliard.

19:54.255 --> 19:55.454
Go on a big world tour,

19:55.456 --> 19:56.789
meet all these new people.

19:56.791 --> 19:59.158
I thought you wanted me to stay.

19:59.160 --> 20:00.659
Then it's Julliard.

20:00.661 --> 20:01.694
No, I do.

20:01.696 --> 20:03.662
But them girls.

20:03.664 --> 20:06.398
They gonna mess you up and turn you out.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.534
Turn me out?

20:08.536 --> 20:10.970
You don't think I can handle myself.

20:10.972 --> 20:13.639
Listen.

20:13.641 --> 20:15.341
I think you're beautiful.

20:15.343 --> 20:16.742
I think you're brilliant.

20:16.744 --> 20:19.011
- I think you're talented, sexy.
- Mm-hmm.

20:19.013 --> 20:21.780
I could go on. Want me to?

20:21.782 --> 20:23.716
How do you know?

20:23.718 --> 20:25.651
You haven't even heard me sing.

20:25.653 --> 20:28.315
Every time I ask you, you turn me down.

20:41.802 --> 20:43.169
What was I saying?

20:43.171 --> 20:46.305
That I'm sheltered.

20:46.307 --> 20:48.174
There's nothing wrong with that.

20:48.176 --> 20:50.042
I'm gonna make sure my kids are sheltered

20:50.044 --> 20:51.343
away from all this mess.

20:51.345 --> 20:52.878
What mess?

20:52.880 --> 20:55.648
I'm a black man in America.

20:55.650 --> 20:57.082
I got to keep my head down,

20:57.084 --> 20:58.551
my mouth shut and my
hands out of my pockets

20:58.553 --> 21:00.219
just so I can make it home alive.

21:02.056 --> 21:03.355
Hey, Mahogany.

21:03.357 --> 21:05.925
Get your ass out here, 911.

21:07.728 --> 21:10.029
Yeah, you got to see this place.

21:10.031 --> 21:12.498
It's too much for Simone, man.
She's climbing the walls.

21:12.500 --> 21:15.501
We got to get her out.

21:15.503 --> 21:16.535
I disagree.

21:16.537 --> 21:18.370
- You disagree?
- Your sister

21:18.372 --> 21:20.339
needs help. Professional help.

21:20.341 --> 21:22.608
My mother has been
in rehab a dozen times.

21:22.610 --> 21:24.143
Right. And clearly that didn't work.

21:24.145 --> 21:25.644
All Simone needs

21:25.646 --> 21:27.613
is me. She's had a hard life already.

21:27.615 --> 21:29.548
Her being in that place
isn't gonna make it better...

21:29.550 --> 21:31.116
It's gonna make it worse.

21:31.118 --> 21:33.085
- I'm busting her out.
- All right, hold on.

21:33.087 --> 21:35.087
There's guards, orderlies,
and how are you gonna get her

21:35.089 --> 21:36.322
past Carlotta?

21:36.324 --> 21:38.324
What are you about to do?

21:38.326 --> 21:40.752
- Hello?
- I'll show you.

21:45.199 --> 21:46.599
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

21:46.601 --> 21:48.334
yo, what are you doing?

21:48.336 --> 21:50.536
- Are you crazy?
- Come on!

21:50.538 --> 21:51.704
You...

21:56.043 --> 21:59.044
Why'd you say that you were her mother?

21:59.046 --> 22:00.679
She in the system.

22:00.681 --> 22:02.681
If they find out I'm not her mother,

22:02.683 --> 22:05.451
they gonna call Social Services.

22:05.453 --> 22:08.654
Or maybe you wish Simone
was your real daughter.

22:08.656 --> 22:10.956
Well, maybe I do. Maybe
I can give her a normal life.

22:10.958 --> 22:13.158
I'm your daughter.

22:13.160 --> 22:17.396
I named you Arnold, after my father.

22:17.398 --> 22:18.831
Mama, Arnold is dead.

22:18.833 --> 22:20.933
And I'm not talking about Granddaddy.

22:20.935 --> 22:22.401
I'm talking about this Arnold.

22:22.403 --> 22:24.303
This Arnold is dead.

22:24.305 --> 22:26.538
Gone.

22:26.540 --> 22:29.341
I'm getting bottom surgery.

22:29.343 --> 22:33.646
It ain't enough with the boobs
and the hair and the makeup?

22:33.648 --> 22:38.284
No, Mama. I need my
outsides to match my insides.

22:38.286 --> 22:41.553
Well, why would you pay somebody
to mutilate what God gave you?

22:41.555 --> 22:44.590
God gave me me, Mama.

22:44.592 --> 22:46.492
And it's not mutilation.

22:46.494 --> 22:47.793
I know a really good doctor.

22:47.795 --> 22:49.361
He's expensive.

22:49.363 --> 22:52.965
It costs $20,000,
and I've saved up half already.

22:52.967 --> 22:56.635
10 grand?

22:56.780 --> 23:00.148
Now, I know you ain't make
that money answering my phones.

23:00.150 --> 23:04.052
We all do what we got to do, Mama.

23:17.568 --> 23:20.302
Yeah.

23:32.349 --> 23:34.182
I'm the home owner.

23:34.184 --> 23:35.650
This way, ma'am.

23:35.652 --> 23:37.419
We didn't find any signs of a break-in.

23:37.421 --> 23:39.688
Well, why would somebody
just bust my windows

23:39.690 --> 23:41.156
and not take anything?

23:41.158 --> 23:43.091
Not sure. Could be just vandalism.

23:43.093 --> 23:44.926
- Vandalism?
- Yeah.

23:44.928 --> 23:46.962
Window right there.

23:46.964 --> 23:48.930
Derek.

23:48.932 --> 23:50.899
- Yes, ma'am.
- What's goin' on?

23:50.901 --> 23:52.200
Oh, I don't know.

23:52.202 --> 23:53.969
I heard the alarm, came outside.

23:53.971 --> 23:55.470
That's it.

23:55.472 --> 23:56.838
Did you see them girls?

23:56.840 --> 23:57.506
What girls?

23:57.508 --> 23:58.540
Star and Alexandra.

23:58.542 --> 23:59.941
Did you see them tonight?

23:59.943 --> 24:01.543
No, ma'am. I just told the officers that.

24:01.545 --> 24:03.078
I didn't see nobody.

24:07.251 --> 24:10.185
There you are. I've been
looking for you everywhere.

24:10.187 --> 24:11.786
- Uh, you have?
- Mm-hmm.

24:11.788 --> 24:14.456
My supervisor wants me to
assist in your procedure.

24:16.226 --> 24:18.393
Excuse me, Nurse,
where are you taking...

24:18.395 --> 24:20.128
- We're on our way.
- Get out, get out, get out, get out, go!

24:20.130 --> 24:22.464
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Oh, my God.

24:22.466 --> 24:25.333
Go, go, go, go! They're coming!

24:41.400 --> 24:43.715
I just got a call from Conny Reed.

24:43.740 --> 24:45.767
Why are you more than an hour late?

24:45.769 --> 24:47.335
Call me.

24:50.774 --> 24:52.342
_

24:52.408 --> 24:55.347
_

25:02.411 --> 25:05.378
No. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

25:05.380 --> 25:07.247

25:07.249 --> 25:08.425

One, two, three, four.

25:26.835 --> 25:28.535
So,

25:28.537 --> 25:30.537
the song's called "Man."
I was thinking heavy drums

25:30.539 --> 25:32.739
and maybe some reverb on the
bass line, you know?

25:32.741 --> 25:34.941
Look at you, talking like a big shot.

25:34.943 --> 25:37.277
That Julliard must have paid off.

25:37.279 --> 25:38.711
I never needed Julliard.

25:38.713 --> 25:40.513
I am good though.

25:40.515 --> 25:42.015
You better be.

25:42.017 --> 25:44.350
And not just using your
daddy's name either.

25:45.325 --> 25:46.820
Sing something in the mike.

25:49.458 --> 25:51.324

26:15.383 --> 26:18.351
Yeah.

26:18.353 --> 26:20.086
Where those girls?

26:20.088 --> 26:22.422
Wait, what?

26:22.424 --> 26:24.023
Don't mess with me, Jahil.

26:24.025 --> 26:25.925
I'm standing here with the police.

26:25.927 --> 26:28.261
The police. What for?

26:28.263 --> 26:30.830
Well, one of your songbirds OD'd tonight.

26:30.832 --> 26:33.700
Then her crazy-ass sister threw
a brick through my damn window

26:33.702 --> 26:35.768
and busted her out of the hospital.

26:35.770 --> 26:37.437
I told you you couldn't handle them.

26:37.439 --> 26:39.105
- I warned you.
- All right, look, just give me

26:39.107 --> 26:40.573
the information and I'll be there.

26:40.575 --> 26:42.475
No, no, you give me the information.

26:42.477 --> 26:43.409
Now, they said something

Turn it off.

28:44.128 --> 28:45.915
Didn't you used to sing
with Mixed Harmony?

28:45.940 --> 28:47.630
That's none of your business. You see

28:47.632 --> 28:49.732
that girl right there? She's underage.

28:49.734 --> 28:51.400
She OD'd on drugs last night.

28:51.402 --> 28:53.869
- She should be in a psych ward.
- What are you doing here?

28:53.871 --> 28:55.271
Why do you got to ruin every
single thing I try to do?

28:55.273 --> 28:56.906
Your sister almost died last night,

28:56.908 --> 28:58.707
and you're worried about your career?

28:58.709 --> 29:01.510
My sister is fine. Simone,
come in here. She's fine.

29:01.512 --> 29:03.612
She wants to be here, and she
wants to sing. You can go.

29:03.614 --> 29:05.948
No, she doesn't.
She wants to make you happy.

29:05.950 --> 29:07.349
This has nothing to do with Simone.

29:07.351 --> 29:09.485
This has to do with you and me.

29:09.487 --> 29:11.520
I look like my mother,
I sound like my mother,

29:11.522 --> 29:14.089
and it kills you, because...
just like my mother...

29:14.091 --> 29:15.491
I'm young and I'm sexy
and I have more talent

29:15.493 --> 29:16.759
than you ever did.

29:16.761 --> 29:19.261
Bitch, you ain't your mother.

29:20.164 --> 29:22.064
I watched your mother die.

29:22.066 --> 29:23.899
And I'm not about to watch it again.

29:23.901 --> 29:25.835
Simone needs help.

29:25.837 --> 29:27.570
- I know what she needs.
- Stop, okay? I said stop!

29:27.572 --> 29:29.738
Stop talkin' 'bout me
like I ain't even here.

29:29.740 --> 29:31.740
If I want to smoke weed, I'll smoke weed.

29:31.742 --> 29:34.577
And if I want to sing a damn song,
I'll sing a damn song.

29:34.579 --> 29:36.378
And if I want to kill myself, I will.

29:36.380 --> 29:38.447
Yo. You know what? Too much drama.

29:38.449 --> 29:40.749
I'm out. Good luck.

29:40.751 --> 29:41.951
We out of here. Hey, man,

29:41.953 --> 29:43.252
- tell your daddy I said hey.
- Thanks, Big.

29:43.254 --> 29:44.954
All right. Fo' sho. Be safe.

29:44.956 --> 29:46.288
- You happy?
- Come on. I'm driving you

29:46.290 --> 29:47.957
- back to the hospital.
- No. No, no. Stop.

29:47.959 --> 29:49.603
No, I don't want to go.
I want to go home.

29:49.628 --> 29:52.528
You can't. The hospital
called looking for you.

29:52.530 --> 29:55.531
If you not back there in a half an
hour, they calling the cops.

29:55.533 --> 29:57.833
Once they do that,
I can't do anything to protect you.

29:57.835 --> 29:59.240
You going back into the system.

30:11.148 --> 30:12.147
What's the emergency?

30:12.149 --> 30:13.916
I need you to do me a favor.

30:13.918 --> 30:16.185
All right? It's gonna
sound kind of strange,

30:16.187 --> 30:18.654
but... I need
you to hit me in the face.

30:18.656 --> 30:20.289
You know, bruise me up a little bit.

30:20.291 --> 30:21.390
What, are you crazy?

30:21.392 --> 30:22.625
Look, I'm-I'm in a jam, Hunter.

30:22.627 --> 30:24.226
Okay? So just please hit me.

30:24.228 --> 30:26.161
- Come on. I need you to
do this, all right? - No.

30:26.163 --> 30:27.563
Hey, you know how much
these hands are worth?

30:27.565 --> 30:28.931
I got my team relying on me.

30:28.933 --> 30:30.900
- No, ask somebody else.
- Hey.

30:30.902 --> 30:32.701
I got no one else to ask, all right?

30:32.703 --> 30:33.869
I got no one else.

30:33.871 --> 30:36.038
You worried about your hands?

30:36.040 --> 30:37.873
What?

30:37.875 --> 30:39.875
This. Go ahead. Use this.

30:39.877 --> 30:41.010
- You're out of your mind.
- Use it.

30:41.012 --> 30:42.645
Use it. Come on.

30:42.647 --> 30:44.480
Hunter, I'm in trouble! All right?

30:44.482 --> 30:46.715
I'm in big trouble this time,
all right? So, please,

30:46.717 --> 30:48.851
please, hit me.

30:48.853 --> 30:51.053
Come on.

30:51.055 --> 30:52.688
Hit me!

30:52.690 --> 30:54.423
Do it! Hit me!

30:54.425 --> 30:56.215
Do it, man, do it!

30:57.651 --> 30:59.141
What the hell happened?

30:59.166 --> 31:01.603
You guys set me up is what happened.

31:01.605 --> 31:04.239
You told me this was a legit businessman.

31:04.241 --> 31:05.841
He is. Bryan King.

31:05.843 --> 31:07.843
He owns half the real estate in Atlanta.

31:07.845 --> 31:09.077
Wait, what do you mean?

31:09.079 --> 31:10.612
I thought this was a local pimp.

31:10.614 --> 31:12.180
No, this is his side business.

31:12.182 --> 31:14.016
That don't make no sense.
That dude is rich.

31:14.018 --> 31:15.350
Why would he mess with trafficking?

31:15.352 --> 31:17.160
$500 a day per girl.

31:17.162 --> 31:18.862
That's, what, $200K a year?

31:18.864 --> 31:21.265
And that shipment that you lost,

31:21.267 --> 31:23.767
that's worth $2 million a year to him.

31:23.769 --> 31:26.870
Look, man, all I know is I did
exactly what you told me to do.

31:26.872 --> 31:29.006
All right? I picked up
those girls in that van

31:29.008 --> 31:31.108
and I'm headed to the drop.
Next thing I know,

31:31.110 --> 31:33.502
some dude with a gun...
He pulls up next to me,

31:33.504 --> 31:36.371
forces me over, kicks my
ass and then he steals the van.

31:36.373 --> 31:38.282
Where's the money, Jahil?

31:38.284 --> 31:40.684
There ain't no money, man.
I never made it to the drop.

31:40.686 --> 31:42.853
That's what I'm trying to
tell you. This dude,

31:42.855 --> 31:45.489
he had some mask on,
so I don't know who he was.

31:45.491 --> 31:47.491
I have no idea where he took those girls.

31:47.493 --> 31:49.393
Yeah, well, Maggie's gonna be furious.

31:49.395 --> 31:51.728
Yeah, unless she set me up.

31:51.730 --> 31:54.731
Try to get those girls for free.

31:58.771 --> 32:01.405
Damn, I'm so bored, man.

32:01.407 --> 32:04.280
- I want to get out of here.
- Yeah, remember that

32:04.305 --> 32:06.443
the next time you want to
take a fistful of pills.

32:06.445 --> 32:09.546
I didn't do it on purpose.

32:09.548 --> 32:11.148
That's what your mother would have said

32:11.150 --> 32:12.549
if she would have lived.

32:20.250 --> 32:22.250
You know, your mother used to read to you

32:22.252 --> 32:23.694
when you were in her belly.

32:24.755 --> 32:26.421
What would she read?

32:26.423 --> 32:27.823
Poetry.

32:27.825 --> 32:30.367
It used to help her write music.

32:35.607 --> 32:38.275
Do you have any of that stuff, still?

32:38.277 --> 32:40.077
Her poetry?

32:40.079 --> 32:41.311
No.

32:41.313 --> 32:43.046
I lost it.

32:43.048 --> 32:44.948
Look...

32:44.950 --> 32:47.651
I don't want you going down
the way your mother did.

32:47.653 --> 32:49.619
If that's where you're going,

32:49.621 --> 32:52.689
you need to get up out of my
house and do it somewhere else.

32:52.691 --> 32:54.891
It's not the path I'm going on.

32:54.893 --> 32:57.361
It was a one-time thing, I swear.

32:57.363 --> 32:59.496
Okay.

33:03.035 --> 33:05.335
So, you ready to talk now?

33:06.772 --> 33:09.139
I know you're a runaway.

33:09.141 --> 33:11.308
And I know you got somebody in your head

33:11.310 --> 33:14.211
stirring up them nightmares.

33:14.213 --> 33:17.175
So what was they doing in your last home?

33:18.817 --> 33:20.951
Was it your foster mother?

33:22.721 --> 33:25.389
No.

33:25.391 --> 33:29.025
She just let him do whatever he wanted.

33:30.829 --> 33:32.362
He beat her?

33:32.364 --> 33:34.498
Sometimes.

33:35.534 --> 33:37.834
He hit you?

33:39.671 --> 33:41.505
No.

33:41.507 --> 33:43.940
He was real nice to me.

33:46.478 --> 33:48.478
He used to

33:48.480 --> 33:50.380
give me pot

33:50.382 --> 33:52.282
when she wasn't around.

33:54.920 --> 33:57.020
And he would...

33:58.357 --> 34:01.491
...keep me from school...

34:01.493 --> 34:03.727
to have sex with me.

34:06.598 --> 34:08.398
You ain't tell your foster mother?

34:08.400 --> 34:11.067
No, she knew.

34:11.069 --> 34:13.503
And she liked it.

34:13.505 --> 34:15.739
She liked it.

34:15.741 --> 34:18.175
'Cause...

34:18.177 --> 34:21.178
the more he messed with me,

34:21.179 --> 34:23.719
the less he messed with her.

34:26.851 --> 34:29.018
So you want to know why I get high?

34:32.190 --> 34:33.889
That's why.

34:33.891 --> 34:35.492
Because I can't...

34:35.494 --> 34:37.427
Simone.

34:37.429 --> 34:40.563
It's okay. It's okay, baby.

34:40.565 --> 34:42.532
Let me tell you something.

34:42.534 --> 34:45.034
That man...

34:48.474 --> 34:51.308
...he's never gonna hurt you again.

34:51.310 --> 34:54.043
I swear to God.

35:00.652 --> 35:03.186
How's your sister?

35:03.188 --> 35:05.388
What happened to your face?

35:05.390 --> 35:06.723
I got carjacked.

35:08.760 --> 35:10.193
Stop it.

35:15.968 --> 35:18.702
You're a bad liar.

35:18.704 --> 35:22.405
Which is disturbing,
'cause you're our manager.

35:22.407 --> 35:25.909
Part of being a good manager
is being a good liar.

35:25.911 --> 35:28.545
But you know what?
You got a bigger problem.

35:31.783 --> 35:33.783
I don't think you play to win, Jahil.

35:33.785 --> 35:35.218
Win?

35:35.220 --> 35:37.721
How am I supposed to win?

35:37.723 --> 35:39.923
I can't even get to the starting line.

35:42.294 --> 35:45.128
Look, let me ask you something, Star.

35:45.130 --> 35:47.297
Why do you want me to manage you?

35:47.299 --> 35:50.000
Because you'd knock over your mother

35:50.002 --> 35:51.635
to get to the top.

35:56.074 --> 35:58.975
And some people might think
that's gross, but I like it.

36:02.554 --> 36:04.520
It's okay.

36:04.545 --> 36:06.116
Then why don't you trust me?

36:06.118 --> 36:07.450
I do.

36:07.452 --> 36:08.985
As much as I trust anybody.

36:08.987 --> 36:10.921
Then why didn't you come
to me about Simone?

36:10.923 --> 36:13.189
Did it ever cross your mind that,
as your manager

36:13.191 --> 36:15.258
and hers, that I might be able to help?

36:15.260 --> 36:17.327
No, not really, unless you
have some sort of medical degree

36:17.329 --> 36:19.629
that I'm not aware of.

36:19.631 --> 36:21.932
And besides that, I know
exactly how you feel about her.

36:21.934 --> 36:23.400
Look, Star, she's a mess.

36:23.402 --> 36:25.268
Anyone can see that. But she needs help.

36:25.270 --> 36:26.970
Real help that you can't give her.

36:26.972 --> 36:29.306
That's my personal opinion.
But as your manager,

36:29.308 --> 36:31.608
she's an anchor around our neck.

36:31.610 --> 36:33.543
She's weighing us down.

36:33.545 --> 36:35.278
I got big dreams for you, Star.

36:35.280 --> 36:36.980
Not those other girls, for you.

36:36.982 --> 36:39.149
Did it ever cross your
mind that maybe this isn't

36:39.151 --> 36:41.084
a life that your sister wants and this is

36:41.086 --> 36:42.586
her way out?

36:42.588 --> 36:44.287
Cut her loose.

36:44.289 --> 36:45.388
You'll both be happier.

36:45.390 --> 36:47.791
No. No.

36:47.793 --> 36:49.092
I'm gonna keep telling you no.

36:49.094 --> 36:51.161
I'm not going to drop my sister.

36:51.163 --> 36:53.997
Wherever I go, she's gonna go.
Whatever I do, she's gonna do.

36:53.999 --> 36:56.666
And whatever plans you have,
they better include her.

36:56.668 --> 36:58.507
And Alexandra. And if you don't

36:58.532 --> 37:00.632
get that, then you don't get me.

37:05.611 --> 37:08.244
All right, well...

37:08.246 --> 37:10.413
we missed the deadline for the festival.

37:13.185 --> 37:15.719
Better figure out what comes next.

37:15.721 --> 37:19.255
There you go again, Jahil,
with that not playing to win.

37:20.659 --> 37:22.559
We didn't miss the deadline.

37:22.561 --> 37:25.462
We've got two hours.

37:27.065 --> 37:29.121
You should be in the loony bin.

37:32.747 --> 37:35.114
That's a good idea.

37:35.139 --> 37:36.606
It is?

37:36.631 --> 37:38.697
Yeah.

37:38.722 --> 37:41.290
Let's bring the mountain to Muhammad.

37:50.503 --> 37:52.303
Babe.

37:52.305 --> 37:54.338
Let's go take a walk.

37:54.340 --> 37:56.574
We're coming right back.

38:13.192 --> 38:15.826
