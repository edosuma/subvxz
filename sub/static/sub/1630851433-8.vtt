WEBVTT

00:59.017 --> 01:00.018
Hey, no.

01:01.061 --> 01:04.272
-I've got to get home to Maddy.
-No. Come back to bed. It's so early.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.361
It's barely light out.

01:10.445 --> 01:13.156
I wanna take the next ferry.
Can you drive me?

01:15.033 --> 01:16.201
Can I cook you breakfast?

01:19.370 --> 01:20.663
I'll wait in the car.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.481
Hey.

01:51.194 --> 01:52.195
Want coffee?

01:55.907 --> 01:57.909
-You okay?
-Oh, yeah.

01:59.077 --> 02:00.537
-You okay?
-Yeah.

02:12.257 --> 02:13.174
I'll wait here.

02:13.842 --> 02:14.676
For what?

02:15.343 --> 02:18.471
You. I was gonna
take you back to the hospital.

02:18.555 --> 02:19.430
That's okay.

02:19.514 --> 02:23.351
There's no way I'm letting you
deal with your mom on your own.

02:24.060 --> 02:28.273
-Grab Maddy. We'll go as a family.
-Can we meet you at the hospital?

02:29.274 --> 02:32.652
That makes no sense.
I'm here now. We could take one car.

02:33.361 --> 02:34.779
I need a minute, Sean.

02:36.739 --> 02:41.536
You don't owe that dork anything, Alex.
You slept at home, in your bed.

02:42.579 --> 02:43.454
Can I just...?

03:05.685 --> 03:06.644
You're awake.

03:07.770 --> 03:12.317
Well, you said
you'd be home soon, ten hours ago.

03:13.359 --> 03:14.485
So yes.

03:15.111 --> 03:17.405
I'm sorry. I had a really weird night.

03:18.198 --> 03:22.452
I saw Sean.
How hard is it to just send a text,

03:22.535 --> 03:25.622
"Hey, I'm not coming home.
I'm gonna fuck my ex"?

03:27.665 --> 03:28.583
Uh...

03:30.418 --> 03:32.921
Something happened with my mom, actually.

03:33.630 --> 03:38.343
She was manic, and she put her hand
through a window and severed a tendon.

03:38.426 --> 03:40.011
She's in the hospital now.

03:40.511 --> 03:43.431
And I'm accusing you
of being on a walk of shame.

03:43.514 --> 03:47.018
-I'm really sorry.
-No, uh... I did sleep with Sean.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.480
I'm not gonna lie to you, and I'm sorry.

03:51.022 --> 03:52.398
Oh. Uh...

03:54.067 --> 03:58.780
No, you don't have to apologize to me.
It's not like we're a couple.

03:59.364 --> 04:04.661
It's not like you sat here yesterday
and told me you couldn't be with anyone.

04:04.744 --> 04:07.997
I really can't. I meant what I said.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.791
-Unless it's Sean.
-No.

04:10.667 --> 04:14.170
What is it about this guy?
Fucking peach fuzz.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.005
Okay, he can make a drink.

04:16.506 --> 04:18.967
I can make a skyscraper,
but you're going back to him.

04:19.050 --> 04:21.552
I'm not, though.
No, I'm not going back to Sean.

04:21.636 --> 04:22.762
You are.

04:22.845 --> 04:24.847
-No, I'm not.
-Of course you are.

04:26.099 --> 04:29.644
You were hurt, and you went to him.
You cried on him.

04:30.353 --> 04:32.605
I just provided daycare.

04:35.149 --> 04:39.779
That's really not what happened, Nate.
That's not what happened.

04:39.862 --> 04:44.367
I don't wanna watch your kid for you
while you fuck Sean.

04:46.411 --> 04:47.245
So...

04:49.122 --> 04:51.082
I'm gonna have to ask you to move out.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.295
I'm not trying to be a dick.

04:56.629 --> 04:58.506
I care about you.

05:01.592 --> 05:03.594
I just can't do a front-row seat.

05:05.763 --> 05:06.597
No.

05:09.767 --> 05:10.727
I understand.

05:13.771 --> 05:16.482
I'm gonna get Maddy,
and we'll get out of here.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.861
-Alex.
-Yeah?

05:22.363 --> 05:23.823
Um, keep the car.

05:25.408 --> 05:26.743
No. I mean...

05:27.869 --> 05:30.830
You need a car, so keep the car.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.587
Thank you for being so kind.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.215
That's me.

05:42.675 --> 05:43.926
Mr. Kind.

05:59.400 --> 06:00.693
-Schmariel?
-Check.

06:02.278 --> 06:03.905
-Mommy's stuff?
-Check.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.282
-Grammy's stuff?
-Check.

06:07.116 --> 06:07.950
Kisses.

06:11.079 --> 06:11.913
Check.

06:14.499 --> 06:15.333
Check.

06:25.843 --> 06:28.471
What you mean to do
and what you intend to do

06:28.554 --> 06:29.972
are not the same thing!

06:30.056 --> 06:34.227
I cannot be held accountable
for someone else's false intention!

06:34.310 --> 06:37.146
Miss Langley,
whatever you say can and will be--

06:37.230 --> 06:42.276
Oh, my God! You're reading me
my rights over a motherfucking scratch!

06:42.360 --> 06:45.363
-Excuse me, what's happening here?
-Get that child out of here!

06:45.446 --> 06:48.866
-Okay. I'll take her outside.
-Get her out of here! I can't do her.

06:50.660 --> 06:54.247
-Uh, I'm sorry, who are you? Sorry.
-She's a fucking bitch.

06:54.330 --> 06:58.835
I'm the DCR, Designated Crisis Responder.
It might be best if you waited outside.

06:58.918 --> 07:02.672
This is about intent! Intent! Intent!
She's my daughter, she'll tell you!

07:02.755 --> 07:06.634
All I need is my good weed
and a fucking hairbrush.

07:07.135 --> 07:08.469
I'll be right with you.

07:14.559 --> 07:17.603
All right, Miss Langley,
I need to ask you a couple of questions.

07:17.687 --> 07:20.064
Are you taking any current medication?

07:32.326 --> 07:33.870
Is she under arrest?

07:33.953 --> 07:36.706
No, no,
the tenant is not pressing charges.

07:37.206 --> 07:41.169
-Why were you reading her her rights?
-I'm a court-appointed DCR.

07:41.252 --> 07:44.422
I was evaluating whether or not
your mother meets the criteria

07:44.505 --> 07:47.091
to be placed
on an involuntary hold or not.

07:47.925 --> 07:49.260
You mean, commit her?

07:50.052 --> 07:53.014
She had a severe manic episode.
She's still symptomatic.

07:53.097 --> 07:55.683
Pressured speech,
delusions, irrational thought.

07:55.766 --> 07:59.228
She told me she thought she owned
the house that she was breaking into.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.355
Oh, she does, or she did.

08:01.439 --> 08:04.484
Ah, well, she also told me
that she's the goddess Aphrodite

08:04.567 --> 08:06.235
and she fucks the sun.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.070
She just says that stuff.

08:08.154 --> 08:11.657
Well, your mother
has refused voluntary treatment,

08:11.741 --> 08:15.161
so I am filing a petition to detain her.

08:15.661 --> 08:18.206
She's a danger to herself and to others.

08:18.289 --> 08:21.042
She would never hurt anybody.
She's harmless.

08:21.125 --> 08:23.461
Well, she hurt herself, seriously.

08:23.961 --> 08:26.297
Unless you wish
to provide collateral information

08:26.380 --> 08:31.093
and take responsibility for her,
then this is just what we have to do.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.970
What's collateral information?

08:33.054 --> 08:36.933
You tell the courts why
you think she's a good-faith volunteer.

08:37.016 --> 08:40.436
You give examples of things she's done
that would make you believe

08:40.520 --> 08:42.480
that she would attend
an outpatient program

08:42.563 --> 08:45.900
and take her prescribed medications
while in your care.

08:47.443 --> 08:48.694
In my care?

08:48.778 --> 08:50.446
We can discharge her to you,

08:50.530 --> 08:53.074
if you're prepared
to give that collateral.

08:53.658 --> 08:56.035
Is that something you're prepared to do?

08:57.161 --> 09:00.081
I have work today. And a 3-year-old.

09:04.919 --> 09:06.462
She scared me last night.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.300
There is an evaluation
and treatment center in Port Orchard.

09:12.468 --> 09:16.472
-How long would she be there?
-Usually 14 days, sometimes 30.

09:17.306 --> 09:18.933
Do I tell her, or do you?

09:19.559 --> 09:23.604
Generally, we don't inform the patient
until it's actually happening.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.023
More soon.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.833
You gotta get me out of here

09:43.916 --> 09:46.669
and away from that woman
trying to lock me up.

09:52.174 --> 09:54.176
Your father tried to lock me up.

09:55.303 --> 09:57.847
Did you tell them I'll take the medicine?

09:57.930 --> 09:59.807
Because I'll take the medicine.

09:59.890 --> 10:03.269
I'm not saying I won't.
I just wanna choose the medicine.

10:03.352 --> 10:07.565
Purple Kush. And I'll go to a life coach.

10:09.191 --> 10:13.195
They're gonna keep you in here
a little longer, keep an eye on your hand.

10:14.071 --> 10:19.619
Wow. Just not past dinner, okay?
Because I saw the menu, it's meatloaf.

10:20.953 --> 10:22.830
Whatever happened to Meat Loaf?

10:23.748 --> 10:24.707
The singer.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.554
I'm worried about you, Mom.

10:40.640 --> 10:45.227
Baby, I just
caught a wave I couldn't handle.

10:47.396 --> 10:48.481
Took me under.

10:49.273 --> 10:51.233
Threw me and my board around.

10:52.318 --> 10:56.238
But I'm like the tide, I roll back in.

10:58.574 --> 11:01.661
Look at me. Surf's up.

11:05.247 --> 11:09.502
-You did that to your own hand.
-Why are you so blue? It's my hand.

11:10.753 --> 11:15.257
Plus, I can paint with this hand.
That's my truth.

11:18.427 --> 11:23.307
Baby. They don't know, baby.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.228
What don't they know?

11:29.689 --> 11:33.150
That the sun bends towards me.

11:36.821 --> 11:40.074
That I contain the sun in here.

12:17.611 --> 12:18.529
Maddy!

12:19.780 --> 12:22.658
Hi, baby girl. How are you?

12:24.326 --> 12:27.121
-You didn't tell me you had people here.
-They just got here.

12:27.204 --> 12:30.875
We just...
We swung by uninvited, such a clichÃ©.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.669
I hope you don't mind
that I brought these.

12:33.753 --> 12:34.712
No.

12:37.173 --> 12:40.009
Sorry to hear about your mom. You okay?

12:40.092 --> 12:42.303
Sounds like you saw her
at a ten out of ten.

12:42.386 --> 12:45.264
-Well, she's got a DCR now. That's good.
-Yeah.

12:45.347 --> 12:49.643
-Maybe she'll get the help she needs.
-All right, say goodbye to Grandpa.

12:49.727 --> 12:50.895
Bye, Grandpa.

12:52.229 --> 12:54.190
Okay, guess that's my cue.

12:54.774 --> 12:55.983
Bye-bye, honey bee.

12:56.567 --> 12:59.945
-Let me know how it goes tomorrow.
-I will. Thank you.

13:00.821 --> 13:03.949
And we will be praying for your mom, Alex.

13:04.658 --> 13:08.162
There's decades' worth of blood, sweat,
and popped blisters on those things,

13:08.245 --> 13:11.290
-so take care of them.
-Gross. Will do.

13:11.373 --> 13:13.167
You told him about my mom?

13:14.168 --> 13:16.796
I had to. He was worried
I didn't show up this morning.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.798
And why do you have his tools?

13:19.298 --> 13:21.592
I'll tell you later. Come here.

13:22.259 --> 13:24.678
Should we give Mommy her surprise? Yeah?

13:29.350 --> 13:30.184
You ready?

13:30.768 --> 13:33.145
Surprise! We made dinner.

13:33.854 --> 13:34.855
Show her, Mad.

13:34.939 --> 13:38.692
-Did you write this?
-All by herself, she wrote that.

13:39.193 --> 13:44.031
-M-O-M-M-Y.
-And you did that all by yourself?

13:44.907 --> 13:49.411
Chili. Extra bland
and spice free, per the chef's request.

13:54.583 --> 13:56.627
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

14:01.173 --> 14:03.801
Hey. Come to bed.

14:04.301 --> 14:05.427
I'm good out here.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.973
It's not like I'm gonna make a move
on you, Alex, we'll just sleep.

14:09.056 --> 14:11.725
I like the couch. Good boundaries.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.522
Well, if you're back, be back.

14:17.481 --> 14:20.860
I'm not back, Sean. I left for a reason.

14:21.402 --> 14:24.113
I'm just staying here
until I get a place for me and Maddy.

14:24.196 --> 14:27.408
-Shouldn't be too long, I've been saving.
-Copy that, commander.

14:30.661 --> 14:34.290
I'm quitting. That's why
Hank was dropping by with his tools.

14:34.373 --> 14:37.960
-Quitting what?
-Bartending. I will become a carpenter.

14:38.627 --> 14:41.213
Hank knows this guy Dwight
that's agreed to take me on.

14:41.881 --> 14:46.927
-To become a carpenter?
-Yeah. I've been thinking about it a lot.

14:47.011 --> 14:50.389
Talking about it in meetings,
bartending's rough on my sobriety.

14:50.472 --> 14:53.726
I'm up all night,
turning down shots, getting no sleep.

14:53.809 --> 14:57.438
Besides, I like working with my hands.
I like being outside.

15:02.276 --> 15:03.527
Why are you saying nothing?

15:05.863 --> 15:07.031
I'm just surprised.

15:07.114 --> 15:09.992
That I don't wanna be
a piece of shit my whole life?

15:10.576 --> 15:11.827
I didn't say that.

15:16.707 --> 15:19.168
It's a good gig once you get started.

15:19.877 --> 15:23.005
Once you're done apprenticing,
I'll be bringing home 25 an hour

15:23.088 --> 15:25.174
by the time Maddy's in the first grade.

15:25.257 --> 15:29.678
That's really great, Sean.
It's gonna be good for Maddy.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.181
It'll be good for all three of us.

15:33.515 --> 15:35.184
Please don't factor me in.

15:37.728 --> 15:38.687
Come to bed.

15:41.565 --> 15:42.399
No.

15:44.860 --> 15:45.736
Come to bed.

15:48.113 --> 15:51.742
No. I have three cleans tomorrow.

15:51.825 --> 15:54.370
I have to see my mom during lunch,
and I need my sleep.

15:58.832 --> 15:59.667
All right.

16:01.126 --> 16:02.836
Guess I'll sleep alone, then.

16:05.506 --> 16:06.465
Maybe naked.

16:09.885 --> 16:11.261
Get the light, please.

16:22.398 --> 16:25.192
Good morning, Miss Maddy.
Wanna have some fun?

16:26.235 --> 16:29.780
Now grab some maracas,
and we're ready to rock.

16:30.322 --> 16:31.156
Bye, Mommy.

16:45.337 --> 16:46.338
Alex.

16:48.424 --> 16:49.341
Over here.

16:51.885 --> 16:54.263
I'm on the Ring, the doorbell camera.

16:55.514 --> 16:57.224
Can you come to the garage?

17:09.653 --> 17:10.612
Regina?

17:10.696 --> 17:11.780
Shh.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.452
God, I have to pee so badly.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.830
-Can you please watch him?
-Oh. Baby Leo's here?

17:19.913 --> 17:20.914
Shh!

17:22.249 --> 17:24.668
Little fucker only sleeps in the car.

17:24.752 --> 17:27.838
I have been doing loops
around Whole Foods.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.050
I'm gonna pee my pants.

17:41.101 --> 17:43.020
Hi, sweetheart.

17:51.528 --> 17:53.947
Why don't you transfer him to the crib?

17:54.031 --> 17:56.950
That's not a thing. He doesn't transfer.

17:57.868 --> 18:00.871
If I so much as breathe on him...

18:02.081 --> 18:06.835
his little eyes rip open
and he starts screaming like a banshee.

18:07.336 --> 18:11.423
Have you tried doing it to music?
Worked great for Maddy. Can I try?

18:11.507 --> 18:13.550
No, no, no. You're kidding.

18:14.176 --> 18:15.844
I'm gonna try it, okay?

18:27.481 --> 18:28.315
No...

18:30.734 --> 18:33.070
We're okay so far. Sorry.

19:25.539 --> 19:26.456
Regina?

19:33.172 --> 19:34.506
I can't do this.

19:37.259 --> 19:39.970
He's been here four days,
and I can't do this.

19:41.930 --> 19:44.016
I'm having hallucinations.

19:45.809 --> 19:50.147
I thought my mug was upside down
this morning.

19:50.230 --> 19:54.026
I turned it right side up,
and I dumped coffee all over myself.

19:55.360 --> 19:58.030
And I keep smelling this horrible smell.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.658
It smells like rotten fruit.

20:03.118 --> 20:04.995
It turns out it's me.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.664
I have body odor!

20:09.124 --> 20:12.753
A week ago, I was eating
arugula salad in my corner office!

20:19.551 --> 20:20.761
You just need a nap.

20:23.138 --> 20:24.264
I'm not in college.

20:25.849 --> 20:26.975
I can't nap.

20:28.310 --> 20:32.147
You've gotta nap when the baby's down.
It's the only way.

20:34.274 --> 20:35.275
Maybe just...

20:36.693 --> 20:38.153
Maybe just ten minutes.

20:38.904 --> 20:39.863
Yes.

20:40.489 --> 20:42.074
Go. It's gonna be okay.

21:52.978 --> 21:55.772
-Hello?
-Hi, is this Alex?

21:55.856 --> 21:57.566
-Hi, yes.
-This is Steve Till.

21:57.649 --> 22:01.194
I'm the chair of the creative writing
program in Missoula. I got your message.

22:01.278 --> 22:03.697
-Thank you so much for returning my call.
-Yeah, sure.

22:03.780 --> 22:07.826
So departmental scholarships
are for the forthcoming academic year.

22:07.909 --> 22:12.456
I'm afraid the one we offered you
four years ago is no longer available.

22:13.749 --> 22:15.917
Okay. Figured I'd just check.

22:16.918 --> 22:20.797
We can consider you for this academic year
if you reapply.

22:21.381 --> 22:23.383
The committee's reading right now.

22:23.967 --> 22:26.178
How much is the application fee?

22:26.261 --> 22:28.263
No, there's no fee to re-apply.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.849
You'd have to submit
an updated writing sample.

22:30.932 --> 22:32.351
Do you have anything new?

22:37.397 --> 22:39.232
Yes. I think so, yes.

22:39.316 --> 22:42.903
Great. Upload it with your application,
and send me the e-mail confirmation.

22:43.737 --> 22:45.405
Does it have to be typed?

23:41.962 --> 23:43.839
-Where's Leo?
-He's asleep.

23:50.387 --> 23:52.973
I feel like an entirely different person.

23:55.267 --> 23:58.061
I didn't sleep. I, um...

23:58.145 --> 23:59.688
I died, briefly.

24:01.648 --> 24:02.482
Thank you.

24:02.566 --> 24:05.944
No problem, and I'm almost done.
Just gonna do your master.

24:06.903 --> 24:10.490
I wanted to ask. Did you and your daughter
ever find a place to live?

24:12.409 --> 24:14.744
-We did, yeah, thank you.
-Good.

24:14.828 --> 24:18.373
I'm sorry I was rude when you asked
if you could be my nanny.

24:18.457 --> 24:22.294
-I shouldn't have asked.
-No, probably not. I mean, read the room.

24:22.377 --> 24:24.671
I have OCD, attachment disorder.

24:24.754 --> 24:26.506
I am an unlikely candidate

24:26.590 --> 24:29.176
for an impulsive
and ill-thought-out childcare plan.

24:32.554 --> 24:34.681
But you weren't asking for yourself.

24:35.849 --> 24:37.559
You were asking for your daughter.

24:40.812 --> 24:43.690
Fuck. I'll see you next week.

25:08.256 --> 25:10.842
Hi, I'm here to see Paula Langley.

25:11.593 --> 25:13.220
Oh, thank God.

25:13.720 --> 25:17.098
You've gotta get me out of here.
This is hell.

25:17.182 --> 25:18.558
This place is hell.

25:19.142 --> 25:22.854
They won't let me use my phone
until phone time.

25:22.938 --> 25:26.107
And they're saying that I have to stay
14 days. Fourteen days.

25:26.191 --> 25:31.321
And I've gotta take xeno-pan
and panda-land and God knows what else.

25:31.404 --> 25:33.323
Honey, they've made a mistake.

25:33.406 --> 25:35.700
You have got to get me out of here.

25:38.328 --> 25:42.916
I don't think I can, Mom.
It's court-mandated.

25:42.999 --> 25:47.379
No, but, baby, you don't understand.
These people are really crazy.

25:47.462 --> 25:52.050
They're crazy, okay. Like, you know,
mentally ill. I'm funny mentally ill.

25:52.133 --> 25:57.681
I run hot, you know. I mean, you know,
I feel things. But these people scare me.

25:57.764 --> 25:58.598
I know.

25:58.682 --> 26:01.685
This guy Ray, okay, honey,
you know what he did?

26:02.310 --> 26:04.938
Chewed his fucking toe off.

26:05.522 --> 26:09.651
Chewed his toe off. I mean, what the fuck?

26:11.987 --> 26:15.782
Well, while you're here,
I guess, you know...

26:17.784 --> 26:19.411
try to make the best of it.

26:20.870 --> 26:23.623
And who knows, maybe
some medication isn't the worst thing.

26:23.707 --> 26:24.666
Oh, my God.

26:25.959 --> 26:26.793
What?

26:27.794 --> 26:31.423
You think I belong here, don't you?
Did you help put me here?

26:31.923 --> 26:34.843
No, Mom, I didn't. The court decided that.

26:34.926 --> 26:37.178
But you didn't say anything
to stop them, did you?

26:40.098 --> 26:41.641
-Mom.
-What did I ever do to you

26:41.725 --> 26:44.436
-that you would do this to me?
-Hey, Mom.

26:44.519 --> 26:45.353
No.

26:47.314 --> 26:50.400
You showed up at my door
with your toddler,

26:50.483 --> 26:53.820
crying because you were homeless,
and you had no place to be.

26:54.404 --> 26:57.407
And I let you stay with me in my tiny RV.

26:58.408 --> 27:03.413
I let you ruin my marriage
with my new husband...

27:05.957 --> 27:11.671
because that's what you do,
when you love someone.

27:12.881 --> 27:14.341
-I love you, Mom.
-No.

27:17.344 --> 27:18.303
Baby, I would...

27:18.970 --> 27:22.182
I would give you the skin off my bones.

27:24.184 --> 27:25.769
I would drink turpentine...

27:26.978 --> 27:30.065
before I would let a bunch of doctors
do this to you.

27:32.567 --> 27:33.401
Mom.

27:34.194 --> 27:39.616
Hey, hey, Mom, Mom, we have 23 minutes.
Can I please just talk to you? I love you.

27:39.699 --> 27:42.243
I love you, and Maddy loves you.
So many people.

27:42.327 --> 27:45.705
Please get this bitch out of here.
Just get this bitch out of here.

27:45.789 --> 27:47.248
-Mother. Mom.
-No!

27:47.916 --> 27:50.126
You need to go. No, sorry. Right now.

27:50.210 --> 27:52.671
-Are you fucking kidding me? Mom!

27:56.675 --> 27:57.676
Hey, Yolanda.

27:58.301 --> 28:00.929
Just swapping out a filter
for 351 Armstrong.

28:01.930 --> 28:04.265
-Swapping out a filter, she says.
-Okay.

28:05.975 --> 28:08.478
-Okay. Is that a problem?
-Of course not. Go ahead.

28:08.561 --> 28:10.522
Help yourself to all my filters.

28:12.732 --> 28:16.361
I'm having a really shitty day. So is
there something that you wanna say to me?

28:19.823 --> 28:24.411
Just had a call from my clients
over at 19 Glastonbury.

28:25.745 --> 28:30.166
She canceled last-minute last week,
which isn't like her.

28:30.250 --> 28:33.128
And then, this week,
she didn't schedule at all.

28:33.628 --> 28:37.549
So being the good businesswoman
that I am, I called her

28:37.632 --> 28:40.343
and asked her,
why is she ghosting Value Maids

28:40.427 --> 28:43.012
after five years of loyal service?

28:43.096 --> 28:44.472
You know what she said?

28:45.056 --> 28:47.142
I got stood up,
and you weren't gonna pay me.

28:47.225 --> 28:51.396
You stole business from me.
Took money directly from my pocket.

28:51.479 --> 28:54.023
I wasn't gonna be able
to pay for daycare, Yolanda.

28:54.107 --> 28:57.569
-I told you I needed another shift.
-And I told you that I expected loyalty.

28:58.611 --> 29:01.239
You're fired.
Leave your ferry pass. Get out!

29:06.286 --> 29:10.206
And if I hear you contacting
a single one of my clients,

29:10.290 --> 29:14.586
I will track you down, beat your ass
and take you to court. You hear me?

29:15.253 --> 29:16.671
-Do you hear me?
-Yes.

29:23.344 --> 29:25.138
Can I get my last paycheck?

29:25.221 --> 29:26.055
Not out yet.

29:27.390 --> 29:29.726
Can I leave you my address
for when it is out?

29:29.809 --> 29:31.311
You can go fuck yourself.

30:07.764 --> 30:11.226
Oh, Miss Russell, your invoice.

30:11.726 --> 30:15.688
I sent it home with Maddy's backpack
last week, but I don't think you saw it.

30:17.524 --> 30:18.942
-I missed it. Thank you.
-Yeah.

30:19.025 --> 30:23.071
There's WCCC paperwork in there too.
We need signatures from your employer.

30:23.154 --> 30:24.113
You got it.

30:24.197 --> 30:28.243
Also, it was ice cream day,
and we didn't want Maddy to go without.

30:28.326 --> 30:30.370
We took it out of the petty cash.

30:30.453 --> 30:33.248
-Oh, thank you. How much do I owe you?
-It's $6.

30:34.958 --> 30:36.000
For ice cream?

30:36.084 --> 30:38.795
Two scoops, and each kid
got three toppings.

30:40.505 --> 30:42.423
-Awesome.
-Yeah.

30:43.800 --> 30:44.634
-Thanks.
-Okay.

30:59.440 --> 31:00.483
Fuck!

31:13.288 --> 31:16.499
Uh, hi, I'm sorry,

31:16.583 --> 31:20.003
you don't happen to have $3
that I could bum off of you for gas?

31:20.628 --> 31:22.046
I can't get home. Sorry.

31:23.214 --> 31:24.048
Um...

31:25.216 --> 31:26.676
-Here.
-Thank you.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.616
All right. Go.

31:50.825 --> 31:51.951
No more cartoons.

31:52.035 --> 31:54.621
Let's go on a hike like old times,
what do you say?

31:55.204 --> 31:58.124
-We're going on a...
-Bear hunt.

31:58.207 --> 32:01.419
-We're gonna catch a...
-Big one.

32:01.502 --> 32:03.254
What a beautiful day.

32:03.338 --> 32:05.423
-We're not scared.
-We're not scared.

32:06.215 --> 32:08.051
-Oh, no, a forest.
-A forest.

32:08.593 --> 32:11.679
-A big, dark forest.
-A big, dark forest.

32:12.430 --> 32:14.474
Oh, no. What?

32:14.557 --> 32:16.809
-We can't go over it.
-We can't go over it.

32:16.893 --> 32:19.604
-We can't go under it.
-We can't go under it.

32:20.688 --> 32:22.899
-We're going on a...

32:23.483 --> 32:24.484
I'm gonna...

32:26.819 --> 32:27.904
I'm gonna get you.

32:30.823 --> 32:33.618
Let's jump over that one.

32:33.701 --> 32:35.495
You sure can. See any fairies?

32:37.455 --> 32:38.748
So...

32:42.335 --> 32:44.379
-Rock.
-Rocks.

32:49.050 --> 32:50.677
Here. Right here?

33:21.124 --> 33:22.709
-Hey.
-Hey.

33:22.792 --> 33:26.254
-I saved you some ziti. Are you hungry?
-Yes.

33:28.715 --> 33:30.800
So how was carpentry 101?

33:30.883 --> 33:31.926
Pretty cool, actually.

33:32.010 --> 33:35.263
Yeah, Dwight's a cool guy.
He's got a kid Maddy's age.

33:37.473 --> 33:39.934
Hank wasn't kidding
when he said he'd be tough on me.

33:40.018 --> 33:43.271
I literally can't feel my fingers
or my ass right now.

33:48.568 --> 33:51.070
-So it was good.
-Yeah, yeah.

33:52.572 --> 33:53.406
Good.

33:58.578 --> 34:00.246
I got fired today.

34:01.581 --> 34:02.874
-You?
-Yeah.

34:04.459 --> 34:05.293
Oh, my.

34:06.169 --> 34:08.671
Well, you've gotta let me have this.
What did you do?

34:10.131 --> 34:12.341
I stole a shift,
and then I pocketed the cash.

34:13.092 --> 34:16.012
You embezzled? Very juicy.

34:18.931 --> 34:21.350
-You've been saving up, right?
-Yeah.

34:21.434 --> 34:23.436
You have enough until you get
something else?

34:25.021 --> 34:25.855
I think so, yeah.

34:25.938 --> 34:29.942
I was thinking, I'm actually gonna
try to get my own cleaning clients

34:30.026 --> 34:32.570
because I still have my supplies
and my car,

34:32.653 --> 34:35.907
-I can probably get a vacuum secondhand.
-Makes sense.

34:36.491 --> 34:41.579
I just have to figure out daycare
because Yolanda took my ferry pass.

34:41.662 --> 34:44.332
Oh, shit. That's goodbye, Island Friends.

34:45.750 --> 34:48.795
-We can't afford ferry trips every day.
-I know, but she loves it.

34:48.878 --> 34:51.172
-She loves being with you more.
-Yeah.

34:52.090 --> 34:55.051
But I can't clean houses full-time
and watch Maddy.

34:55.718 --> 34:58.930
Well, I'm with Dwight
Monday through Friday,

34:59.013 --> 35:01.265
so who else is gonna watch her?

35:05.311 --> 35:10.858
I need to work, Sean. So I can make
my own money so that I can be independent.

35:12.527 --> 35:13.361
Okay.

35:14.821 --> 35:15.655
Yeah.

35:18.157 --> 35:19.117
Um...

35:19.617 --> 35:22.745
Could you clean on the weekends?
I'll watch Maddy.

35:23.329 --> 35:26.249
That's not gonna be enough money
with you apprenticing all week.

35:26.833 --> 35:30.169
-I could pick up some shifts at the bar.
-And watch Maddy all day?

35:32.046 --> 35:34.674
-You're gonna be exhausted.
-Would you relax?

35:36.050 --> 35:37.093
It's fine.

35:37.176 --> 35:39.303
Worst-case scenario,

35:39.887 --> 35:42.223
-Hank and Sharlene can watch Maddy.
-No.

35:43.057 --> 35:45.184
Hank cannot watch Maddy.
That's not an option.

35:46.894 --> 35:49.355
-What is with you and your dad?
-He's not a good guy.

35:50.523 --> 35:54.777
He got me a job.
He's really sweet with Maddy.

35:56.362 --> 35:57.780
He takes me to meetings.

35:59.282 --> 36:01.576
I need you to listen to me, okay?

36:02.410 --> 36:05.872
Just trust me and promise me
that he won't be near Maddy.

36:05.955 --> 36:10.877
Okay. No Hank.
We'll figure it out ourselves.

36:14.547 --> 36:15.464
I think we can.

36:18.426 --> 36:19.260
Okay.

36:26.893 --> 36:28.686
I love these flowers.

36:37.945 --> 36:39.155
You look good, Mom.

36:41.532 --> 36:43.201
I brought you a lipstick.

36:45.369 --> 36:47.496
I don't care if you don't talk back.

36:48.122 --> 36:51.292
I'm still gonna come every day
that Sean has Maddy.

36:51.375 --> 36:53.836
-We're going on a...
-Bear hunt.

36:53.920 --> 36:56.881
-We're gonna catch a...
-Big one.

36:56.964 --> 36:58.341
She's been asking about you.

36:58.925 --> 37:01.844
-We're going on a...
-Bear hunt.

37:03.471 --> 37:08.100
They said that she's
artistically gifted, in her preschool.

37:09.018 --> 37:12.188
And I was like, "Yeah, of course."

37:13.356 --> 37:15.858
She's been painting with my mom
since birth.

37:23.824 --> 37:25.660
Blink if you hear me.

37:26.619 --> 37:27.453
Mom.

37:28.371 --> 37:31.415
-We're going on a...
-Bear hunt.

37:31.499 --> 37:34.001
-We're gonna catch a...
-Big one.

37:35.169 --> 37:36.087
I'll get you.

37:37.255 --> 37:40.383
-Uh-oh, what do you see?
-Trees.

37:53.938 --> 37:55.356
Can I tell you a secret?

37:56.607 --> 38:00.236
I applied to the writing program
in Missoula.

38:04.407 --> 38:08.411
It's a long shot because my writing sample
is about cleaning toilets.

38:10.037 --> 38:11.539
And what if I did get in?

38:15.918 --> 38:18.587
What if we moved there when you get out?

38:20.673 --> 38:25.261
You could paint and hang out with Maddy.

38:27.096 --> 38:29.765
Float down that river
with some cold beers.

38:37.023 --> 38:40.526
When you get better,
there's so much light waiting for you.

38:42.528 --> 38:43.696
And so much love.

38:57.084 --> 38:57.918
Hey.

38:58.002 --> 39:00.588
-I made you a grilled cheese.
-Thanks.

39:17.938 --> 39:19.648
Are you too tired to do this?

39:20.858 --> 39:24.195
-I don't need to be awake to bartend.
-So, um...

39:27.531 --> 39:32.828
My phone's almost out of minutes,
and we're out of milk and snacks.

39:33.329 --> 39:35.414
-I have a coupon, but--
-How much?

39:37.083 --> 39:37.958
Uh...

39:38.542 --> 39:42.213
Well, I also need money
for gas, so, like, $50.

39:42.880 --> 39:47.176
Uh, do we have to keep your phone on?
Can we just share mine?

39:50.054 --> 39:52.390
I've put my number on the cleaning ads.

39:53.057 --> 39:55.601
-People need to be able to call me.
-Yeah, but nobody is.

39:56.185 --> 39:58.771
I mean... Right?

40:02.274 --> 40:03.359
I'm trying.

40:05.236 --> 40:08.948
Nobody wants weekend cleans.
Everybody wants weekdays and referrals.

40:09.573 --> 40:13.077
Well, I'll have cash tonight,
and we'll figure it out. Okay?

40:14.453 --> 40:15.287
Fuck.

40:15.788 --> 40:16.622
What?

40:16.705 --> 40:18.040
-Nah--
-What?

40:19.542 --> 40:20.626
Your dad's here.

40:22.670 --> 40:23.838
Stay here, okay?

40:31.262 --> 40:32.763
Hey, stranger.

40:34.181 --> 40:35.391
You wanna give me a hand?

40:36.058 --> 40:37.351
What's all this?

40:38.519 --> 40:43.149
Oh, this is just some of Alex's stuff
from the apartment with the black mold.

40:44.150 --> 40:46.485
I told her I'd go back for it
with my truck,

40:46.569 --> 40:48.404
and I do what I say I'm going to do.

40:48.487 --> 40:50.406
Should have called first, Hank.

40:50.990 --> 40:51.866
Right.

40:52.867 --> 40:53.784
Guilty.

40:54.785 --> 40:56.162
Came to get eyes on you too.

40:57.872 --> 40:58.831
Drinking again?

40:59.665 --> 41:00.499
No.

41:02.543 --> 41:05.796
-Haven't seen you in any of the meetings.
-I've been working a lot.

41:07.923 --> 41:12.178
-I thought we got you out of bartending.
-I'm doing both for a while now.

41:13.262 --> 41:17.266
Well, there's a meeting at the VFW
in half an hour, so...

41:18.225 --> 41:21.479
-Come on, we can go together.
-No, thanks.

41:26.609 --> 41:29.778
I've been where you're at before.
But you can't do it alone.

41:29.862 --> 41:31.155
Okay, you've got to--

41:31.238 --> 41:33.324
You've got to tap into something stronger.

41:33.407 --> 41:35.034
You can't come by here anymore.

41:37.786 --> 41:40.122
Who says? You?

41:40.831 --> 41:41.749
Or her?

41:42.416 --> 41:43.250
Her.

41:44.877 --> 41:45.961
But I'm with her.

41:46.045 --> 41:47.004
Mm.

41:47.546 --> 41:48.547
Is she with you?

41:51.133 --> 41:53.219
Because you're not
going to meetings any more,

41:53.302 --> 41:55.054
she's got you working two jobs.

41:55.137 --> 41:56.222
Doesn't seem like it.

41:57.848 --> 41:58.682
You done?

42:00.392 --> 42:02.311
You need to get yourself to a meeting.

42:15.908 --> 42:17.117
Well, that was fun.

42:17.201 --> 42:20.037
Being an asshole to somebody
without knowing why.

42:36.428 --> 42:37.721
Do you wanna wait up for me?

42:40.474 --> 42:42.476
All right, I'll hurry back.

42:42.560 --> 42:45.479
I'm gonna do some fucking
lightning-speed bartending.

42:46.188 --> 42:47.273
Woo-hoo!

42:51.360 --> 42:53.404
We're going on a...

42:53.487 --> 42:54.613
Bear hunt.

42:54.697 --> 42:56.615
We're going on a...

42:56.699 --> 42:57.700
Bear hunt.

42:57.783 --> 42:59.410
We're gonna catch a...

42:59.493 --> 43:01.453
Oh, look, you found one. See it?

43:05.374 --> 43:07.459
-Hello?
-Where the hell are you?

43:08.460 --> 43:09.503
Uh, who is this?

43:09.587 --> 43:10.588
Regina.

43:10.671 --> 43:14.550
Some random girl is here from Value Maids.
I got your number from her. Where are you?

43:15.217 --> 43:16.385
I got fired.

43:17.011 --> 43:18.012
So?

43:18.095 --> 43:19.847
I'm not loyal.

43:19.930 --> 43:22.182
I am home. With a newborn.

43:22.266 --> 43:25.311
And this woman is totally incompetent.

43:27.062 --> 43:28.564
How soon can you be here?

43:29.315 --> 43:31.400
I have Maddy today.

43:31.900 --> 43:33.902
How about tomorrow?

43:37.031 --> 43:38.532
I can't afford the ferry.

43:41.994 --> 43:43.912
I can offer you three shifts a week.

43:43.996 --> 43:46.624
Twenty dollars an hour,
15 hours guaranteed.

43:46.707 --> 43:49.418
You can clean
and help me take care of Leo.

43:49.501 --> 43:53.005
I will provide a ferry pass and supplies.

43:53.088 --> 43:53.922
How's that?

43:54.548 --> 43:55.466
Yes, yes, yes.

43:55.549 --> 43:56.383
Hello?

43:59.637 --> 44:00.971
-Hello?
-Regina?

44:03.766 --> 44:04.808
Okay, Mad.

44:04.892 --> 44:06.894
We're going on a bear hunt.

44:06.977 --> 44:09.480
We're going to get some phone minutes.

44:17.655 --> 44:19.657
Yes, I'll be there tomorrow. Yes.

44:21.116 --> 44:22.034
What number is this?

44:22.117 --> 44:25.245
This is Alex, sorry, I'm at a payphone.
My phone ran out of minutes.

44:26.163 --> 44:26.997
What?

44:27.498 --> 44:29.124
I'm at a payphone,

44:29.208 --> 44:32.711
but you can e-mail me the ferry pass
and I can print it out at the library.

44:35.714 --> 44:36.799
What's your e-mail?

44:42.763 --> 44:44.640
Hi, Magda, how's it going?

44:44.723 --> 44:45.808
Sign in here?

44:46.308 --> 44:47.476
Wait here, please.

44:48.352 --> 44:50.604
Miss Langley's daughter is here. Okay.

44:53.941 --> 44:56.110
-Miss Langley's daughter?
-Hiya.

44:56.777 --> 45:00.906
We dropped the hold on your mother.
She was discharged at45 today.

45:00.989 --> 45:03.200
-What do you mean?
-The DCR determined

45:03.283 --> 45:06.036
she no longer met the criteria
to be detained.

45:06.704 --> 45:09.081
The DCR can just change their mind?

45:09.164 --> 45:12.918
If collateral information
is given from immediate family.

45:13.836 --> 45:15.504
What family? I'm her only family.

45:15.587 --> 45:16.922
A Basil Desmond.

45:17.005 --> 45:19.925
He gave collateral
and she was discharged into his care.

45:20.008 --> 45:23.804
How the fuck did Basil know she was here?
Was she allowed to call him?

45:23.887 --> 45:25.639
It's not a prison, Miss Russell.

45:29.268 --> 45:30.477
Maybe it's good.

45:31.103 --> 45:33.689
You've been responsible for your mom
your entire life.

45:33.772 --> 45:36.775
If she wants to run off with Basil,
what can you do?

45:36.859 --> 45:38.360
I don't feel like doing this.

45:38.444 --> 45:42.948
-I'll just drop you guys off and go home.
-No. Everyone wants to see you.

45:43.031 --> 45:45.451
Tania was your best friend for years.

45:46.034 --> 45:49.329
-I should have given collateral.
-Hey, don't beat yourself up.

45:49.413 --> 45:52.750
She's not your child.
You can't force her to do anything.

45:53.876 --> 45:55.419
And you got a job today.

45:57.296 --> 46:00.132
Island Friends agreed
to let Maddy come part-time

46:00.215 --> 46:03.093
so I can drop her off,
clean Regina's and then pick her back up.

46:03.177 --> 46:05.429
Yeah, see? You rocked it.

46:06.138 --> 46:07.055
For Maddy.

46:12.186 --> 46:14.188
Can I have your attention, please?

46:14.271 --> 46:16.398
I'm gonna say a few words about Ethan.

46:20.360 --> 46:24.490
The man who has done nothing right
since I met him in the second grade.

46:24.573 --> 46:26.366
Including second grade itself,

46:26.450 --> 46:27.868
which he repeated twice.

46:29.077 --> 46:30.829
-Yeah, true story.
-Dick.

46:30.913 --> 46:32.372
Nineteen years I've known this guy.

46:32.456 --> 46:34.917
I thought I knew
what his life would look like,

46:35.000 --> 46:36.835
and I thought I knew exactly who he was.

46:36.919 --> 46:39.671
But what I didn't know
was the power of Tania.

46:40.923 --> 46:42.216
-Thank you.

46:42.299 --> 46:43.425
Thank you.

46:43.509 --> 46:48.263
Yeah. She smoothed his rough edges.
You encouraged him to get an education.

46:48.347 --> 46:51.058
Got him to stop wearing
those lime-green Crocs.

46:53.852 --> 46:55.062
-Yes.
-Well done.

46:55.604 --> 46:58.690
You saw what he could be.
Helped him get there.

46:59.942 --> 47:02.277
So let's all raise a glass to Ethan...

47:03.237 --> 47:06.114
who is doing what we all told him to do
from day one:

47:06.198 --> 47:07.908
Marry this magnificent woman.

47:07.991 --> 47:09.159
Cheers.

47:17.751 --> 47:20.170
-That was really great.
-Thanks.

47:21.338 --> 47:22.673
You can relax.

47:22.756 --> 47:25.467
Hey, come here.
That's it, come here, sweetie.

47:30.180 --> 47:32.099
Hey. You.

47:34.226 --> 47:36.478
Thanks for coming.

47:36.979 --> 47:39.481
I wasn't sure you would.

47:40.732 --> 47:45.070
Me neither, but then I was like,
"There's probably gonna be free food..."

47:45.821 --> 47:46.947
Yeah.

47:48.282 --> 47:49.700
Congratulations.

47:50.325 --> 47:53.203
I love that you did it at City Hall.
Very cool.

47:53.287 --> 47:56.331
Yeah, with the reception in the bar
I've worked in for six years.

47:56.415 --> 47:57.666
Very romantic.

47:57.749 --> 47:59.001
-Amazing.
-Yeah--

47:59.084 --> 48:01.879
Yeah, we're trying to save money.
I'm, uh...

48:02.504 --> 48:03.338
pregnant.

48:03.422 --> 48:06.341
-Oh, my God, wow!
-Yeah.

48:06.425 --> 48:07.634
Congratulations!

48:07.718 --> 48:09.803
That's amazing. Wow.

48:11.597 --> 48:12.598
Yeah.

48:13.557 --> 48:16.852
So you and Sean are back on?

48:17.895 --> 48:18.937
Oh, no. Uh...

48:19.021 --> 48:20.981
No, I'm just staying there
for a little bit.

48:22.065 --> 48:26.320
Oh. Does he know that?
He's been saying the opposite to Ethan.

48:27.029 --> 48:28.280
Um...

48:29.239 --> 48:30.490
Um...

48:30.574 --> 48:34.578
Can I use your printer?
I need to print my ferry pass.

48:34.661 --> 48:36.121
At my wedding?

48:36.204 --> 48:38.665
Yep. Sorry, my phone's out of minutes.

48:38.749 --> 48:40.834
Yeah, my iPad's behind the bar.

49:07.945 --> 49:09.655
What are you smiling about?

49:10.405 --> 49:11.239
I...

49:11.323 --> 49:12.950
I got a scholarship to Missoula,

49:13.033 --> 49:15.035
the same as four years ago,
I just found out.

49:15.118 --> 49:16.536
No fucking way.

49:17.204 --> 49:18.455
That's awesome!

49:19.331 --> 49:20.499
Oh, my God.

49:21.291 --> 49:22.334
What's awesome?

49:22.417 --> 49:24.378
Well, this smarty-pants here

49:24.461 --> 49:27.422
just got a scholarship to Missoula, again.

49:27.506 --> 49:28.757
Yeah, get it.

49:29.883 --> 49:31.301
When did you apply?

49:32.302 --> 49:35.389
I reapplied a few weeks ago. It was free.

49:35.973 --> 49:37.641
Why didn't you tell me?

49:38.809 --> 49:42.020
Wasn't anything to tell. I literally
just found out 30 seconds ago.

49:42.104 --> 49:44.147
You didn't think
taking my daughter to Montana

49:44.231 --> 49:45.941
was something that we should discuss?

49:48.026 --> 49:48.944
Um...

49:50.320 --> 49:51.363
Hmm?

49:59.788 --> 50:01.623
I don't know why you're acting this way.

50:01.707 --> 50:02.874
How else should I react?

50:03.583 --> 50:05.002
You could be happy for me?

50:05.085 --> 50:08.630
I'm working two jobs, busting my ass
to be a better person for you.

50:08.714 --> 50:09.881
For absolutely no reason.

50:09.965 --> 50:12.634
You had a getaway car
parked outside the entire time.

50:12.718 --> 50:15.554
-That's not what this is.
-Oh, what am I doing any of this for?

50:16.430 --> 50:17.514
I really don't even--

50:17.597 --> 50:20.976
Do you have any idea
how hard it is not to fucking drink!

50:21.059 --> 50:22.352
You're gonna wake up Maddy.

50:24.521 --> 50:27.774
I thought we were building something
together, as a family.

50:31.737 --> 50:33.071
It's a writing program, Sean.

50:33.155 --> 50:36.033
-This has nothing to do with you.
-It has nothing to do with me?

50:36.116 --> 50:37.367
Is Nate going with you?

50:37.451 --> 50:40.495
-No. No.
-You say that like I should know better.

50:40.579 --> 50:43.290
But I don't know shit.
I don't know what you're applying to,

50:43.373 --> 50:47.544
I don't know what your plan is without me.
This whole thing is fucking fucked!

50:48.503 --> 50:49.629
Get in the car!

50:53.633 --> 50:54.801
Get in the car!

51:45.936 --> 51:47.771
The chair of the English Department

51:47.854 --> 51:49.981
said my stories were really good.

52:49.541 --> 52:50.375
Sean.

52:51.209 --> 52:52.043
Sean.

52:52.711 --> 52:53.545
Where's my car?

52:54.921 --> 52:55.839
Where's my car?

52:56.464 --> 52:57.340
Nate's car.

52:58.800 --> 52:59.634
What?

53:00.719 --> 53:01.678
Nate's car.

53:05.098 --> 53:08.185
-What are you talking about?
-I gave it back to the prick.

53:09.352 --> 53:12.355
I'm sick of looking at another man's car
in my driveway.

53:12.439 --> 53:15.066
You didn't do that. You didn't do that.

53:15.150 --> 53:17.027
-You gave it back to him?
-Yeah.

53:17.861 --> 53:19.571
No. No.

53:19.654 --> 53:22.365
-Look, if he wants to do charity work...
-No, no!

53:22.449 --> 53:25.243
-...he could donate it to the Red Cross.
-Sean! That's my car!

53:25.327 --> 53:27.913
That is my life. That is my only way
for me to leave here!

53:27.996 --> 53:29.497
Sean, that is the only way

53:29.581 --> 53:32.042
-for me to do anything--
-I'm late for work!

53:53.438 --> 53:54.814
I'm so stupid.

54:03.698 --> 54:04.908
I'm so stupid.

54:09.454 --> 54:10.997
I'm so stupid.

54:19.464 --> 54:21.132
We're going on a...

54:21.216 --> 54:22.050
Bear hunt.

54:22.133 --> 54:23.885
We're going on a...

54:23.969 --> 54:25.345
Bear hunt.

54:25.428 --> 54:27.305
We're going to catch a...

54:27.389 --> 54:28.598
Big one.

54:28.682 --> 54:30.892
We're going to catch a...

54:30.976 --> 54:32.227
Big one.

54:32.310 --> 54:34.938
We're going on a...

54:35.021 --> 54:36.398
Bear hunt.

54:36.481 --> 54:37.524
Come on, Maddy.
