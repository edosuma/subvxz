02:09.255 --> 02:11.975
Sedna! You!

02:12.037 --> 02:16.337
I have to protect your clan since time

02:16.396 --> 02:20.316
But now, you left me
and summon demons?!

02:20.344 --> 02:22.464
I do not need protection from you again.

02:22.488 --> 02:24.788
Thungalukh so strong.

02:24.829 --> 02:29.949
With this saying, you have condemned yourself
and all your clan.

02:29.962 --> 02:32.782
I'll take away all the animals.

02:40.965 --> 02:49.997
Legend of Sarila

03:02.467 --> 03:05.937
Where are all the animals?
It's been 3 months!

03:05.971 --> 03:08.809
I hope others have better luck than us.

03:11.594 --> 03:14.814
Shaman says that the angry spirits of the clan
.

03:14.829 --> 03:17.049
Shaman should bring back the animals!

03:17.054 --> 03:18.854
What else is he waiting for?

03:24.761 --> 03:26.149
Kai kai .

03:40.686 --> 03:43.058

- You can talk to Lemming?

03:43.096 --> 03:45.335
I...
Not!

03:46.593 --> 03:49.301
Only
a shaman who can talk to animals.

03:49.377 --> 03:50.728
Leave him!

03:50.804 --> 03:52.441
I want to keep it.

03:52.519 --> 03:54.587
Animals are food!

03:55.536 --> 03:57.356
But he is so small.

03:57.430 --> 03:58.850
Charmingly true.

03:58.856 --> 04:00.976
He can not even filling one person.

04:01.007 --> 04:02.527
He could be dog food!

04:02.597 --> 04:05.424
Poutulik!
Bahagiakanlah your bride!

04:05.454 --> 04:07.574
Okay.
But hide it!

04:07.671 --> 04:09.979
Everyone is starving.

04:11.329 --> 04:13.642
I'll call you Kimi.

04:14.516 --> 04:17.243
Well!
At least we did not go home empty-handed.

04:17.255 --> 04:18.975
Oh... we hunters are very great!

04:19.060 --> 04:20.974
Instead of bringing food to the clan.

04:20.975 --> 04:24.065
We even carry one another
mouth to be fed.

04:33.118 --> 04:35.591
Laiken Black.

04:35.672 --> 04:38.699
I was not expecting to find it again.

04:40.082 --> 04:44.279
- What are you doing?
- Making medicine for the Chairman's wife.

04:44.397 --> 04:46.717
I would be a doctor when I grow
.

04:46.782 --> 04:51.897
If so, you have to learn the secrets of plants
!

04:52.551 --> 04:56.490
Root Sandword.
The secret of this root is...

04:56.548 --> 04:59.745
-... you must eat it.
- I'll save it for my brother.

05:10.148 --> 05:13.148
Do not be afraid, Kahzouk!
He ​​will not eat you.

05:13.163 --> 05:16.733
Be careful, Mipoulok!
The dogs are also starving.

05:28.063 --> 05:31.763
Once again, Shaman.
Hunters we did not get anything.

05:31.781 --> 05:34.701
We do not get to be exchanged
pelts or meat to eat.

05:34.762 --> 05:38.756
I feel the demons around me.
Weaken strength.

05:38.794 --> 05:42.100
None of us
clan who want to hurt you.

05:42.686 --> 05:44.571
Markussi...

05:45.167 --> 05:49.316
- She's just a poor orphan...
-... with strange powers.

05:49.616 --> 05:53.072
He made his son
against you!

05:54.114 --> 05:59.364
Remember!
Spirit spoke to me!

06:05.012 --> 06:07.429
Enough is enough!
Come disbanded!

06:11.127 --> 06:13.397

06:34.822 --> 06:37.392
- May I hold it?
- He Lemming talking.

06:37.417 --> 06:38.417
True?

06:38.442 --> 06:42.310
- Lemming talking? Come Chic.
- See you later, Mipoulok.

06:42.335 --> 06:46.324
- Lemming talking?
- All animals can talk.

06:46.349 --> 06:49.283
- But we do not want to hear it.
- You can hear the words of the beast?

06:49.308 --> 06:51.104
Did they tell you why they left?

06:51.129 --> 06:53.657
Your question a lot, little sister.

06:53.682 --> 06:56.082
I do not know why the animals go.

06:56.090 --> 06:59.210
And... I do not know if we could eat
today.

06:59.294 --> 07:02.821
- I know!
- Did you find anything?

07:02.846 --> 07:05.158
This is a surprise.

07:21.273 --> 07:24.583
Drink.
This will make you feel better.

07:30.667 --> 07:34.187
If he does not eat meat immediately.
The baby will die.

07:34.246 --> 07:37.866
Ghosts
told me that all the animals will be returned.

07:37.866 --> 07:39.786
Then it will be too late.

07:39.835 --> 07:43.082
- We have to go to Sarila!
- Sarila?

07:43.107 --> 07:46.907
Shut up, basic stupid old woman!
You make the ghost angry!

07:46.970 --> 07:48.709
Let him speak, Shaman.

07:49.330 --> 07:53.517
A long time ago, my father told me about a land...

07:53.542 --> 07:56.636
... which is located in the North,
in between Glacier.

07:56.661 --> 08:03.495
Mainland rich people and only
saint can be entered...

08:03.520 --> 08:06.773
... and accumulate wealth.

08:06.798 --> 08:10.594
Sarila... it's just a legend!

08:11.895 --> 08:14.794
If Sarila actually exist, I would know!

08:14.819 --> 08:16.738
The spirits will surely tell.

08:17.709 --> 08:19.529
And what if Sarila really exist?

08:19.574 --> 08:22.796
Now is not the time to believe the fairy tale!

08:22.821 --> 08:26.606
- Shaman! Shaman! Hurry!
- Help!

08:33.389 --> 08:37.655
- Kahzouk! Oh, Kahzouk!
- Move!

08:38.696 --> 08:40.962
This dog will die.

08:45.092 --> 08:49.073
- Will you save him?
- This dog has been possessed!

08:49.098 --> 08:51.506
- He must be sacrificed!
- Not!

08:51.512 --> 08:55.638
The dog is no longer yours,
he already belonged to the spirits.

08:56.337 --> 08:58.157
Leave him to me.

08:58.182 --> 09:00.982
This dog must die!

09:01.057 --> 09:03.384
Not! This dog will live.

09:06.374 --> 09:07.774
Calm down.

09:15.615 --> 09:18.557
Markussi! Thank you!

09:19.231 --> 09:21.931
Like magic.
How do you know?

09:21.948 --> 09:23.068
He asked her.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.430
- Do not you, brother?
- He asks?

09:25.507 --> 09:28.851
I... do not!
Not like that.

09:29.554 --> 09:31.052
Come on.

09:37.637 --> 09:41.856
They laugh at me!
Because the boy!

09:42.125 --> 09:45.475
He thought that he was a shaman...
.

09:50.211 --> 09:55.253
Wait until he saw what I had planned for her
.

10:08.221 --> 10:10.362
Press strong!

10:12.754 --> 10:15.054
You're going to hunt bear with this?

10:15.152 --> 10:19.906
This is a powerful weapon. The flint spear
will directly bear pierced heart.

10:20.706 --> 10:23.074
Stay away, Kahzouk!

10:28.565 --> 10:30.903
I'm glad to see you laugh.

10:30.928 --> 10:34.512
Do you often laugh with our parents.
Do you remember?

10:36.433 --> 10:40.548
- What is it?
- I was too young when they died.

10:42.967 --> 10:46.477
... Promise me you will not die!

10:46.502 --> 10:48.127
I promise.

10:54.326 --> 10:56.656
This is specifically for hunters.

11:27.763 --> 11:31.160
- How, Shaman?
- I've decided.

11:31.185 --> 11:33.957
It's time to go to Sarila.

11:33.982 --> 11:36.246
Do you believe it now?

11:36.271 --> 11:38.235
Well.

11:38.894 --> 11:42.085
Spirit has been talking to me.

11:42.586 --> 11:44.879
Who will you send?

11:45.879 --> 11:49.163
I said holy
only person that can be entered.

11:49.199 --> 11:55.144
Great Spirits  Crow can decide.
The hunters will be chosen at sunrise.

11:55.189 --> 11:59.161
I believe that the Supreme Crow
will make the right decision.

12:00.163 --> 12:03.036
Ah! Sarila!

12:05.437 --> 12:07.837
Guess who will be sent.

12:07.877 --> 12:10.287
Markussi!

12:10.550 --> 12:12.891

13:00.907 --> 13:05.392

14:27.925 --> 14:32.180
Ouch! You're hurting me!
I have a right to go.

14:32.191 --> 14:33.739
This is not our tradition!

14:33.740 --> 14:37.102
Now we should only be

14:37.127 --> 14:41.127
Just do what was done by the great-grandfather of
our great-grandfather.

14:41.128 --> 14:43.533
Do not ever change.

14:43.558 --> 14:47.212
- That's how we survive.
- The Great Crow chose.

14:47.237 --> 14:51.957
- What about wild animals?
- Had been months since I did not see the animals.

14:51.982 --> 14:56.286
Anyway, I'm not afraid.
I know how to talk to bears.

15:11.282 --> 15:13.162
Want some tea?

15:16.183 --> 15:18.432
What's your problem?

15:19.304 --> 15:21.627
I'm not going to Sarila.

15:23.118 --> 15:25.059
Why not?

15:25.084 --> 15:27.962
I'm a lousy hunter!

15:28.517 --> 15:31.717
Not what they say about you
.

15:31.773 --> 15:37.738
- I can not leave Mipoulok.
- I'll keep it as my own daughter.

15:38.546 --> 15:41.346
I do not know what happened to me.

15:41.371 --> 15:45.354
I heard.
The animals talk to me.

15:50.555 --> 15:57.255
You have the power.
You're going to be a great shaman.

15:57.326 --> 15:59.646
As Croolik?
Not! Never will!

15:59.679 --> 16:02.399
Not!
You will never be like him.

16:02.423 --> 16:05.043
How can you be his wife?

16:05.100 --> 16:07.868
It's been a long time.

16:07.893 --> 16:09.874
She used to be different.

16:09.899 --> 16:13.599
Now he's changed so much since our son died
!

16:13.615 --> 16:16.815

17:55.903 --> 17:59.326
So invincible wolves will take care of you...

17:59.351 --> 18:02.963
-... and protect you from harm.
- Thank you, Shaman.

18:02.988 --> 18:06.325
Croolik well.

18:09.329 --> 18:11.729
I have the best dog.
I will lead the way.

18:11.819 --> 18:15.659
- If you know the way, I'm ready to follow you.
- Towards the end of the world.

18:15.684 --> 18:17.648
Towards Sarila!

18:34.166 --> 18:36.342
Faster!

19:00.647 --> 19:03.681
Thungalukh! Thungalukh!

19:03.791 --> 19:09.660
Give medallion
twin with the power of fire and darkness!

19:10.168 --> 19:16.932
Kedalion Hopefully this makes my blood could be a means of revenge
.

19:31.470 --> 19:33.270
Try to follow me!

19:46.859 --> 19:47.959
Come on!

20:15.978 --> 20:17.856
Stop!

20:26.932 --> 20:28.352
The ice!

20:28.368 --> 20:32.088
Not!
Do not say and also do not sweat! You are wrong!

20:32.112 --> 20:34.332
Wooo .. you become a Shaman now.

20:34.337 --> 20:36.063
You can read people's minds?

20:36.122 --> 20:40.125
The ice! The ice is too thin!

20:40.150 --> 20:45.877
We should be wasting time
and surrounds the edge of the river.

20:45.902 --> 20:48.702
I actually would not say a waste of time.

20:48.739 --> 20:50.439
Maybe it is better to seek safety.

20:50.533 --> 20:54.644
No, there is no problem with the ice.
The ice can survive.

20:54.669 --> 20:59.845
See this my stomach! I have not eaten, I
as light with a bird.

20:59.870 --> 21:01.470
Do you think to fly to the other side?

21:01.487 --> 21:03.487
My body is not heavy enough to break the ice
!

21:03.539 --> 21:07.176
Moreover, white ice is strong enough
bypassed.

21:07.176 --> 21:09.570
Even for polar bears.

21:34.867 --> 21:36.613
Jump!

21:38.473 --> 21:40.218
Stop!

21:48.612 --> 21:49.632
Help!

21:49.653 --> 21:52.570
- Do not worry! We will help you.
- Hold on!

21:54.729 --> 21:57.620
Crossed by stepping on my back! Fast!

21:57.700 --> 21:59.758
I got you!

22:06.611 --> 22:09.455
- Oh no!
- Markussi! Not!

22:14.250 --> 22:16.070
Come, Markussi.

22:16.141 --> 22:19.798
- How do you know who I am?
- Do not be afraid.

22:19.872 --> 22:23.789
- I am the goddess Sedna.
- But they...

22:23.814 --> 22:25.814
I've been waiting for.

22:25.829 --> 22:28.706
- I was dead?
- Not.

22:28.731 --> 22:31.631
But you should keep
with me if you want.

22:31.660 --> 22:34.865
- I had to go to Sarila!
- Why?

22:34.936 --> 22:39.493
The journey is very difficult!
Only a few survived.

22:39.518 --> 22:41.818
You can live happily here.

22:41.889 --> 22:46.714
Goddess! You carry away all the animals.
My clan hunger.

22:47.069 --> 22:48.669
Sarila is our only hope.

22:48.715 --> 22:53.772
- You've got the heart of a shaman.
- I'm not a shaman. I'm a hunter.

22:53.797 --> 22:55.967
- Help me!
- Not

23:01.099 --> 23:02.665
Hunger...

23:02.690 --> 23:05.863
No, Sedna! Hunger...

23:05.888 --> 23:08.284
Must save...

23:11.550 --> 23:15.338
- Chic! Poutulik!
- We are here, Markussi.

23:15.385 --> 23:17.007
Lie.

23:18.696 --> 23:22.100
- We were worried we lost you.
- Chic!

23:22.125 --> 23:27.442
- What... sled...
- Poutulik you out of the water.

23:27.467 --> 23:29.973
He saved you.

23:32.045 --> 23:35.936
- You like to succeed you catch fish?
- The fish is too small.

23:35.961 --> 23:38.540
Maybe I should throw it back into the water.

23:51.446 --> 23:53.892
This is for you, Uliak.

23:57.112 --> 23:59.572
This is for you.

24:01.124 --> 24:04.913
Wait your turn! You will have meat
if your job is complete!

24:04.938 --> 24:08.438
Caution! Spirits of darkness will cut out your tongue!

24:08.531 --> 24:12.831
Do not carry the souls in this matter!
They're not listening to you anymore!

24:12.876 --> 24:15.430
You're exhausted, Shaman!

24:15.455 --> 24:17.325
Basic you!

24:18.952 --> 24:24.443
What is preventing you from asking Sedna
to release all the animals.

24:24.885 --> 24:26.705
I have a point.

24:26.987 --> 24:29.245
It's time to perform a ceremony.

24:30.315 --> 24:35.165
Okay. Tomorrow in the ice sheet.

24:40.232 --> 24:41.908
Kwatak!

24:42.532 --> 24:45.641
Back, basic stupid crow!

24:45.666 --> 24:49.005
Come catch the thief bird, Shaman!

24:50.174 --> 24:52.717
Bastard!

24:52.723 --> 24:55.064
Wait till I catch you!

24:58.587 --> 25:01.275
I have a mission for you.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.968
Thungamatlukh

25:14.158 --> 25:16.842
Inkueilukamatlukh

25:30.359 --> 25:34.410
Sedna! Listen to the sound of my clan...

25:34.435 --> 25:38.457
... Beg your forgiveness and release all the animals!

25:38.482 --> 25:42.904
Prove to us that you have your blood
hear my prayer.

25:47.047 --> 25:53.441
Blood of Sedna!
The Goddess has forgiven us.

25:54.912 --> 25:57.748
Croolik still has power.

26:05.702 --> 26:08.572
That was certainly able to silence them!

26:08.573 --> 26:10.040
Not!

26:28.752 --> 26:32.078
Poutulik!
Come on, pause!

26:34.277 --> 26:35.992
Stop!

26:36.017 --> 26:40.419
- It's too early to set up camp.
- But this place is perfect.

26:41.326 --> 26:44.546
- Why did you stop?
- Markussi want to see.

26:44.617 --> 26:46.717
Enjoy the view.

26:48.176 --> 26:50.681
A sunny day for running.

26:50.685 --> 26:54.473
- But you need to rest!
- Take! We'll take turns.

26:54.474 --> 26:57.493
Are you planning to set up camp here? Come on!

27:01.544 --> 27:03.490
There!

27:10.733 --> 27:12.386
Wait!

27:12.411 --> 27:15.297
Looks like... Kwatak!

27:15.789 --> 27:18.663
- Croolik crow belongs.
- You're right.

27:18.688 --> 27:20.987
What is he doing so far from camp
?

27:36.717 --> 27:39.675
How was the trip?

27:39.700 --> 27:43.564
What news have you got for me?

27:45.265 --> 27:47.281
Talk clearly!

27:49.092 --> 27:51.990
They already get that far?

27:55.825 --> 27:57.677
Poor kid.

27:57.702 --> 28:04.281
He did not know how difficult this journey
later.

28:07.435 --> 28:12.176
's Footprints or Lemming giant bear!

28:14.210 --> 28:18.300
Stop kidding!
You made Kimi fear!

28:18.586 --> 28:22.384
Lemming of that size could feed
villagers during the winter.

28:23.318 --> 28:27.076
Track is still new.
The bear was not so far away.

28:28.556 --> 28:32.556
- I'll go this way.
- Good! Stay with Markussi.

28:32.584 --> 28:36.561
Follow the Lemmings!
Quick!

28:57.070 --> 28:58.664
Be careful!

29:01.106 --> 29:03.447
They are so cute!

29:06.354 --> 29:08.436
Oh! Watch out!

29:12.313 --> 29:14.182
Run, Chic!

29:47.562 --> 29:51.243
Thungalukh! Thungalukh!

29:51.268 --> 29:53.168
Ahkee armieal

29:53.193 --> 29:57.266
Ahkee armieal akrabankhtakar...

30:10.528 --> 30:12.857
I'm so stupid!

30:13.584 --> 30:16.104
Shhh! Do not be noisy!

30:16.189 --> 30:18.289
- What's going on?
- I do not know.

30:18.322 --> 30:20.142
Do not be far away from me!

30:30.336 --> 30:32.221
Run!

30:44.992 --> 30:49.012
I was Ukpik, guardian spirits.

30:49.060 --> 30:52.475
Protective spirit?
What are you talking about?

30:52.565 --> 30:54.684
I did not say anything!

30:54.691 --> 30:56.311
You do not see an owl?

30:56.398 --> 31:01.447
Draw a circle in the snow.
It will free up my strength.

31:01.523 --> 31:04.062
Do not stop!
Run!

31:06.109 --> 31:07.824
Oh no!

31:22.425 --> 31:26.869
You... you make the fog disappear.

31:26.894 --> 31:30.948
You made a bear fears.
You can talk with my Lemming.

31:30.973 --> 31:32.473
How can you do it?

31:32.482 --> 31:34.757
I do not know, Chic.

31:34.782 --> 31:38.551
Spirits... talk to me...

31:38.797 --> 31:42.625
Come on! It'll be dark!
We have to find shelter.

31:51.712 --> 31:56.118
Thank you, the Great Bear.
Because prolong our lives with your life.

31:58.610 --> 32:00.440
Poutulik!

32:02.026 --> 32:04.126
You really are a great hunter!

32:04.128 --> 32:06.656
Oh, my stomach is empty!
Thank you!

32:06.681 --> 32:10.072
But not enough to feed the whole clan
during the winter.

32:10.980 --> 32:14.267
poor Poutulik.
Life is hard hunter.

32:14.317 --> 32:17.792
Do not worry.
Much can we hunt in Sarila.

32:21.446 --> 32:25.346
The bear was staring at me! Then I looked at the bear
eyes and said...

32:25.371 --> 32:29.094
... "Listen, be prepared to die for my clan
starving!"

32:29.119 --> 32:30.319
- Is not he talk to you?
- Not!

32:31.644 --> 32:35.479
But I promised to give him a drink of fresh water
if I won the fight.

32:35.504 --> 32:36.804
Why?

32:36.842 --> 32:39.062
It was a way to thank them.

32:39.073 --> 32:43.655
Then the bear was standing.
He ​​was so great!

32:43.680 --> 32:45.351
Stop it, Kimi!

32:45.376 --> 32:47.767
He snaps and dropped my gun.

32:47.792 --> 32:51.261
I fallen! I'm going to die!

32:51.286 --> 32:53.398
- Huh?
- Chic, are you listening?

32:53.423 --> 32:57.058
What? Yes, continue your story.

32:57.552 --> 33:01.052
But I took my gun and I shot without membdik.

33:01.077 --> 33:05.001
The bear
collapsed like a hawk in the spring.

33:05.026 --> 33:08.626
Remarkable story. You have to tell it to others
when we're back.

33:08.715 --> 33:11.468
- You want to know what happened to us?
- What?

33:11.493 --> 33:13.193
We saw two bear cubs

33:13.287 --> 33:16.207
Parent  bear appeared behind me.

33:16.225 --> 33:18.545
- And Markussi...
- Do not forwarded, Chic!

33:18.588 --> 33:20.904
There's nothing to tell.

33:21.894 --> 33:24.394
Bear with her children.
Why did not you tell me?

33:24.437 --> 33:25.557
Do not, Poutulik!

33:25.572 --> 33:28.472
They were little!
What will they do without their mother?

33:28.497 --> 33:31.175
- They may have gone away now.
- Huh!

33:31.200 --> 33:34.401
And you call yourself a hunter.

33:37.031 --> 33:39.831
What do you want, old Witch?

33:39.905 --> 33:42.438
You're lying!
I saw.

33:42.985 --> 33:45.305
What are you talking about?

33:45.365 --> 33:49.430
In a slab of ice.
It's not his Sedna.

33:49.455 --> 33:52.201
Do you use animal bladders.

33:55.625 --> 33:58.059
I am very worried.

33:58.413 --> 34:01.433
You're so closed is not like it used to.

34:01.483 --> 34:03.803
This is because what you did to my son.

34:03.876 --> 34:05.976
She is too young to hunt.

34:06.001 --> 34:08.501
But you want to send him away with...

34:08.536 --> 34:11.524
father Markussi nothing to do.

34:11.549 --> 34:17.849
My legs were destroyed by looking for it. And every day
remember what had happened.

34:17.936 --> 34:21.255
They struck by lightning!
It was an accident!

34:21.341 --> 34:22.960
Show a little respect!

34:23.045 --> 34:26.166
Menhormatiku not you be?
I was a Shaman!

34:26.232 --> 34:28.408
It used to be you were a Shaman.

34:28.433 --> 34:31.533
Now you have been blinded by vanity and ambition
.

34:31.608 --> 34:33.128
Basic  stupid old woman!

34:33.150 --> 34:35.933
I still have the power!

34:44.706 --> 34:48.860
Go! Find your twin brother!
Go!

34:52.081 --> 34:54.647
You guys ready?
We're going to run today.

35:19.890 --> 35:22.858
Do you see?
Sarila that way.

35:25.447 --> 35:27.267
Come on! We go.

35:27.331 --> 35:30.131
- Where are you going?
- Return to camp.

35:30.156 --> 35:32.192
Turned directions!

35:32.217 --> 35:34.533
- What Sarila?
- Come on! Take!

35:34.558 --> 35:36.671
Hey! What's wrong with you?

35:36.696 --> 35:38.602
- Ouch!
- You're coming with me!

35:38.627 --> 35:40.441
Calm down, Poutulik!

35:44.385 --> 35:46.410
Markussi!

35:46.435 --> 35:48.869
What have you done?
Not!

35:48.894 --> 35:50.294
Do not touch me!

35:50.319 --> 35:54.181
Stop, Poutulik!
He ​​could freeze to death!

36:00.659 --> 36:03.058
Markussi!

36:08.096 --> 36:11.375
Do you remember this one?

36:11.400 --> 36:14.613
Ah... it's a...

36:16.888 --> 36:18.510
Karibu!

36:23.877 --> 36:26.678
Yes! Seal!

36:30.497 --> 36:32.792
What kind of dog is that?

36:32.817 --> 36:36.034
Not at all similar to the dog Markussi.

36:42.074 --> 36:44.988
Markussi  You miss, is not it?

36:46.262 --> 36:48.523
You must miss him.

37:00.398 --> 37:03.659
- What is it?
- You'll see.

37:16.163 --> 37:20.540
It Markussi! It Markussi!
I see it!

37:23.892 --> 37:25.812
He disappeared!

37:25.901 --> 37:30.364
Do not worry.
Markussi will return soon.

37:36.238 --> 37:38.439
Markussi...

37:53.416 --> 37:56.628
- Someone could die here alone!
- Poutulik!

37:56.653 --> 37:58.367
Off me!

37:59.118 --> 38:00.635
Not!

38:00.698 --> 38:02.386
Stop!

38:13.620 --> 38:15.663
Bad news?

38:17.466 --> 38:21.440
Ahhh... to be left alone.

38:22.903 --> 38:27.175
Markussi will freeze to death.
Good!

38:28.194 --> 38:34.571
But... why I do not send
small ice storm to make sure.

38:42.508 --> 38:45.851
Hey! Stop!

38:45.876 --> 38:47.573
What?

38:47.898 --> 38:50.985
What are we...?
What are we doing here?

38:51.010 --> 38:52.610
Where Markussi?

38:52.623 --> 38:55.443
What happened to you?
Do not you remember?

38:55.486 --> 38:57.606
You beat him and left him for dead.

38:57.650 --> 39:00.381
Not!
Markussi is my best friend!

39:00.406 --> 39:02.006
You do not want to let me
back to help him!

39:02.068 --> 39:04.118
I would never do that!

39:04.143 --> 39:06.499
Why can not I remember?

39:06.524 --> 39:08.564
I do not know, Poutulik.

39:08.589 --> 39:12.189
But let's go. Quickly we find Markussi
!

39:12.225 --> 39:14.449
Yes. Of course!

39:15.960 --> 39:17.815
Come on!

39:39.302 --> 39:41.196
Ouch!

39:41.904 --> 39:43.533
Kimi!

39:52.609 --> 39:54.429
We have to move!

40:05.561 --> 40:07.277
Come on!

40:12.810 --> 40:15.507
Pull! Pull!

40:19.100 --> 40:22.196
- We have to stop!
- Not! Markussi!

40:22.221 --> 40:26.221
- I know, but...
- I'm not going to stop! FRIENDS!

40:26.228 --> 40:30.087
We're all going to die if we do not take refuge
!

40:47.281 --> 40:51.738
Brother!
I see in the shadows.

40:51.763 --> 40:56.098
- Mipoulok?
- The road is long for hunters.

40:56.123 --> 40:58.393
Wake up!

41:02.139 --> 41:04.539
Chic... not...

41:04.610 --> 41:07.037
Do not...

41:21.396 --> 41:24.652
Shut up, stupid crows basis!
We can get caught!

41:25.722 --> 41:29.022
We're gonna party tonight, Kwatak.

41:29.091 --> 41:32.950
Celebrating our victory over Markussi.

41:34.167 --> 41:38.960
Ah... wait... I just thought of something.

41:38.985 --> 41:44.259
I also got a little surprise for
old woman.

41:48.940 --> 41:53.002
After the storm subsides, we will seek Markussi
.

41:53.027 --> 41:57.028
Maybe... somehow...

42:01.992 --> 42:04.972
- Markussi!
- My friend!

42:05.823 --> 42:07.840
Chic!

43:01.279 --> 43:04.179
Charmingly told me I hit yesterday.

43:04.204 --> 43:07.342
- Leaving lying there.
- You do not remember?

43:07.667 --> 43:09.725
Not at all.

43:09.750 --> 43:12.950
I know you would never do such a
.

43:12.980 --> 43:16.500
Evil spirits possessed you to do
.

43:16.545 --> 43:19.464
But where? And why?

43:20.089 --> 43:22.857
We must remain vigilant.

43:24.071 --> 43:27.037
Calm down.
Smart dog.

43:28.121 --> 43:31.406
- How did you survive the storm?
- I...

43:32.063 --> 43:34.156
I see a shadow.

43:35.295 --> 43:41.268
I see Charmingly was crying.
I followed.

43:41.293 --> 43:45.544
- Do you really have the power of the Shaman.
- I'm not a Shaman!

43:45.569 --> 43:48.373
Apik I'll tell about your strength.

43:48.398 --> 43:50.549
He already knows.

43:50.874 --> 43:52.961
Do you tell first?

44:00.526 --> 44:03.738
This is the most heinous theft!

44:03.763 --> 44:07.063
This is a crime against the whole clan!

44:07.151 --> 44:09.909
Culprit will definitely be punished!

44:21.196 --> 44:24.186
He's still alive?!
Not!

44:24.211 --> 44:26.158
I want him dead!

44:26.183 --> 44:32.671
Seeing him draw his last breath when he kicked
and fall to the bottom of the hill!

44:35.048 --> 44:39.024
I know.
I would change into a black tick!

44:40.509 --> 44:43.498
Yes, you're right.
I have decided that it is.

44:43.523 --> 44:47.295
Moreover, the ice melts in the spring.

44:49.444 --> 44:54.169
I'm going to turn it into ashes!

45:02.067 --> 45:06.203
Entering the final ingredient...

45:08.128 --> 45:11.058
Yes, yes...

45:15.098 --> 45:17.782
Burn!

45:28.651 --> 45:30.614
Markussi, look!

45:35.063 --> 45:37.570
- What's going on?
- I do not know.

45:41.545 --> 45:43.165
This act spirits!

45:43.178 --> 45:45.678
They are angry at us!
We have to go back to camp!

45:45.760 --> 45:47.180
Not!

45:47.232 --> 45:50.732
This is the power of demons trying to scare us away
Sarila!

45:50.757 --> 45:51.957
Poutulik true!

45:51.982 --> 45:54.770
Do not be afraid!
Let's go!

45:54.795 --> 45:57.022
Quick! Fast!

46:03.785 --> 46:06.266
Markussi, come back!

46:06.648 --> 46:08.388
Not!

46:18.368 --> 46:20.368
A strange smell.

46:20.421 --> 46:27.713
Evil spirits, avenge revenge!
Destroy youth who oppose my power!

46:30.529 --> 46:36.626
Ghost fire, heat source and death! Fly
towards the boy and turn him into ashes!

46:36.951 --> 46:38.796
Rid Markussi me!

46:38.838 --> 46:41.221
Witch damned!

46:41.652 --> 46:45.761
- Do not bother Markussi!
- Get off me!

46:46.086 --> 46:47.755
Damn!

47:15.613 --> 47:17.434
Do something!

47:18.259 --> 47:20.220
Get us!

47:21.245 --> 47:24.078
Use your strength, Shaman!

47:24.403 --> 47:28.095
I'm... I'm not a Sham...!

47:29.424 --> 47:33.102
Yeah... you are a Shaman!

47:35.995 --> 47:39.695
Ukpik! Ukpik!

47:40.293 --> 47:43.186
Come! Help us!

48:27.263 --> 48:31.173
Markussi ! Poutulik!
Wake up!

48:33.294 --> 48:35.172
We're still alive.

48:53.637 --> 48:55.724
Why did you stop?

48:57.001 --> 48:59.219
We should sleep.

49:21.136 --> 49:24.995
Are you going to wait until morning to turn off the lights
it?

49:38.029 --> 49:40.143
Markussi.

49:41.526 --> 49:45.949
Tonight
you have to use your powers for personal gain.

49:45.974 --> 49:49.885
Do you want to become a Shaman
like that?

49:49.910 --> 49:51.713
What are you talking about?

49:51.738 --> 49:55.045
Do you have interest in Chic.

49:55.070 --> 49:58.778
It's up to him to choose his partner.

49:58.803 --> 50:01.750
But you also have a choice.

50:01.775 --> 50:04.862
You can use your powers for yourself...

50:04.887 --> 50:07.706
... or for the good of the clan.

50:08.631 --> 50:11.775
Be careful with your choices!

50:20.622 --> 50:23.122
You made a serious accusation, I am.

50:23.160 --> 50:27.960
I saw him pull out
bladder full of blood in the water.

50:27.979 --> 50:33.243
And I heard him call the fire spirits to harm Markussi
.

50:33.268 --> 50:35.127
Be careful with it!

50:35.152 --> 50:37.795
All he wanted was...

50:39.891 --> 50:42.481
What? What's this?

50:42.806 --> 50:45.676
The bones of the food supply!

50:45.701 --> 50:48.501
I!
He ​​stole food supplies!

50:48.555 --> 50:51.675
- I've never seen it...
- He violated the trust of the clan.

50:51.744 --> 50:54.425
Not! Someone put it there!

50:54.450 --> 50:58.900
Not! The bone is in your igloo!
Under your skin caribou!

50:59.692 --> 51:01.147
I have to...

51:01.545 --> 51:03.534
I have no choice!

51:04.259 --> 51:06.716
I had to call the council chamber clan...

51:06.741 --> 51:08.761
... for judging!

51:18.670 --> 51:20.253
Caution!

51:27.914 --> 51:30.396
- What do you think?
- It's a dead end.

51:30.421 --> 51:33.021
True?
I think we can fly to cross.

51:33.077 --> 51:35.197
Oh no! This is certainly a dead end!

51:35.258 --> 51:38.885
As hunters, we know things like this.

51:43.973 --> 51:46.493
We can not go to the two sides.
We have to in which direction?

51:46.502 --> 51:48.229
Ask bones!

51:56.465 --> 51:58.085
- Huh?
- Not possible.

51:58.165 --> 52:00.169
Throw  again!

52:03.602 --> 52:05.102
We can not go that way.

52:05.170 --> 52:07.687
This is my opinion of this magic!

52:19.115 --> 52:22.615
If bones have straight forward,
then we go right ahead.

52:22.620 --> 52:25.440
But, Poutulik, there is no way to cross
!

52:25.505 --> 52:27.771
There is a shortcut!

52:35.942 --> 52:38.142
It took us half an
winter to get here,...

52:38.143 --> 52:41.087
... we are not going to waste time with the surrounding
.

52:41.112 --> 52:42.787
If you want to cross the chasm,...

52:42.788 --> 52:46.043
... do not ask the Shaman.
Ask hunter.

52:54.950 --> 52:58.306
- All is secure.
- I'm right there.

53:19.064 --> 53:20.524
Catch my hand!

53:20.549 --> 53:22.301
I... I can not!

53:22.326 --> 53:24.287
You can! And you should be!

53:25.980 --> 53:27.605
Can!

53:34.605 --> 53:36.868
This is a great hunting, my friend.

53:37.393 --> 53:39.746
It's still not over!

53:54.384 --> 53:56.123
Now!

54:03.031 --> 54:05.752
Sarila should deserve with all of this!

54:11.062 --> 54:14.406
Is there something you want to add, I?

54:15.094 --> 54:17.362
I'm not guilty!

54:17.887 --> 54:20.415
Who will defend?

54:20.840 --> 54:25.044
He healed my frostbite.
He ​​took care of me like a mother.

54:25.069 --> 54:27.097
He did not deserve to be punished!

54:27.122 --> 54:30.588
I save my wife from
and heal my fever.

54:30.613 --> 54:33.944
's Been a lot of what he did for our clan.
He ​​should be forgiven.

54:33.969 --> 54:39.906
I know secrets about the plant.
For the good of the clan, we have to release him.

54:40.614 --> 54:46.722
If any of you are thinking
he's guilty, raise your hands!

54:47.947 --> 54:50.893
One... two...

54:58.601 --> 55:00.180
Three!

55:01.379 --> 55:04.144
Three against three.

55:05.447 --> 55:10.947
According to tradition, we leave it to the chairman to decide
.

55:11.028 --> 55:13.435
Justice must be upheld!

55:13.596 --> 55:16.558
You all know my feelings towards me.

55:16.559 --> 55:20.067
He is a member of our clan's most respected
.

55:20.944 --> 55:23.587
But
I have seen evidence of this crime...

55:23.612 --> 55:25.387
... with my own eyes.

55:26.163 --> 55:30.871
I was forced to declare
... that I am... guilty.

55:31.396 --> 55:32.396
Not!

55:32.491 --> 55:35.148
- It's not fair!
- He has been maligned!

55:35.173 --> 55:38.940
The habits of our ancestors,...

55:38.965 --> 55:43.018
... you're no longer welcome here, I am.

55:43.043 --> 55:45.469
You have to leave this community...

55:45.494 --> 55:48.520
... for his own life as punishment for your crimes
!

55:48.521 --> 55:50.231
Not!

55:51.049 --> 55:53.124
Do not worry, Mipoulok.

55:53.149 --> 55:57.672
Hauwee will take care of you until
Markussi back.

56:12.572 --> 56:17.301
- The first gorge, the walls now?
- And Sarila over there.

56:26.050 --> 56:28.378
Then I'm going through.

56:48.110 --> 56:52.391
You must have scratched!
Somewhere!

56:54.302 --> 56:56.413
It was weird.

57:00.285 --> 57:02.105
- What did you find?
- Sedna!

57:02.130 --> 57:03.330
Sedna?

57:03.963 --> 57:09.187
Welcome to the Gateway to Sarila.

57:09.412 --> 57:12.112
I could not do it without Poutulik
and Chic.

57:12.176 --> 57:15.193
Does he really talk to Sedna?
About us?

57:16.494 --> 57:20.042
Think back about your trip, Markussi.

58:15.810 --> 58:19.895
You are allowed to enter Sarila.
You deserve it.

58:58.356 --> 58:59.931
Faster!

59:05.113 --> 59:06.804
Faster!

59:38.663 --> 59:41.567
Wait!
Look! Stop!

59:54.054 --> 59:57.468
Wow!
It's beautiful!

01:00:09.149 --> 01:00:13.377
- Even more beautiful than I imagined!
- We made it.

01:00:13.672 --> 01:00:18.258
- Excellent!
- So beautiful!

01:00:29.598 --> 01:00:32.064
That berry!

01:00:32.089 --> 01:00:36.180
- Everything is green!
- The whole clan will be partying.

01:00:36.917 --> 01:00:38.917
See!

01:00:59.231 --> 01:01:01.159
Try it felt!

01:01:09.538 --> 01:01:13.738
The resident clan would not believe if we bring back
berries in season like this.

01:01:32.613 --> 01:01:34.582
Use your spear !

01:01:36.007 --> 01:01:38.196
Do not block me, Markussi!

01:01:42.112 --> 01:01:43.672
Why did not you kill him?

01:01:43.673 --> 01:01:46.181
I can not! She was pregnant.

01:01:46.206 --> 01:01:48.394
We're here to hunt!

01:02:15.605 --> 01:02:18.743
Come on, Kimi.
The water is not harmful.

01:02:40.404 --> 01:02:44.350
You have passed all the exams, Markussi.

01:02:44.375 --> 01:02:46.532
Are you going to release all the animals, Sedna?

01:02:46.557 --> 01:02:48.960
Can my clan hunt again?

01:02:49.467 --> 01:02:53.280
You have to do one small thing for me.

01:02:53.305 --> 01:02:55.392
Tell me!
Will I finish!

01:02:55.417 --> 01:03:00.135
Not! A true Shaman
know what to do.

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.569
But... I do not know.

01:03:03.081 --> 01:03:06.781
When you come back, do
what should you do?

01:03:06.806 --> 01:03:09.765
And all the animals will be released!

01:03:09.790 --> 01:03:11.683
Sedna!

01:03:11.708 --> 01:03:14.097
What does he want?

01:03:20.585 --> 01:03:22.664
Markussi!

01:03:23.082 --> 01:03:25.212
Markussi!

01:03:44.144 --> 01:03:46.144
- Chic!
- Huh?

01:03:57.912 --> 01:04:02.650
Poutulik!
Be weapons and powers!

01:04:02.675 --> 01:04:04.897
Avenge revenge!

01:04:12.293 --> 01:04:14.195
Stop that, stupid!

01:04:26.645 --> 01:04:28.701
Poutulik! Be careful!

01:04:28.726 --> 01:04:30.750
Is he shooting at us?

01:04:30.775 --> 01:04:32.611
Quick!

01:04:32.636 --> 01:04:34.361
Quick!

01:05:00.676 --> 01:05:03.354
- What are you...?
- No time! Fast!

01:05:33.089 --> 01:05:35.838
What... what happened to Poutulik?

01:05:35.863 --> 01:05:38.118
Do you think she is jealous?

01:05:38.143 --> 01:05:40.654
I think... Quick!

01:05:41.864 --> 01:05:44.070
Go up here!
Come on!

01:05:47.086 --> 01:05:48.842
Caution!

01:05:48.867 --> 01:05:50.844
Hold my hand!

01:05:51.515 --> 01:05:53.211
Way!

01:06:00.576 --> 01:06:02.330
Caution!

01:06:04.422 --> 01:06:06.987
- Where to Now?
- Follow me!

01:06:07.812 --> 01:06:09.012
- Poutulik!
- What do you want?

01:06:09.625 --> 01:06:11.445
I want...

01:06:11.456 --> 01:06:12.456
... dead!

01:06:12.481 --> 01:06:15.102
Listen to me!
I know it's hard.

01:06:15.127 --> 01:06:17.694
But we were kids when we promised
.

01:06:17.719 --> 01:06:19.219
Feelings can change!

01:06:19.251 --> 01:06:23.902
What are you talking about?
Everything will be fine if he's dead!

01:06:28.086 --> 01:06:31.876
Medalionnya!
Croolik control with the medallion!

01:06:31.901 --> 01:06:34.423
Basic  sly dog ​​you!

01:06:34.448 --> 01:06:36.683
Do you want to steal my power?

01:06:36.708 --> 01:06:40.372
I'll show you who the real Shaman!

01:06:55.145 --> 01:06:57.045
Hold on!

01:07:00.709 --> 01:07:02.594
What?

01:07:02.617 --> 01:07:05.264
- Markussi!
- Quick help me!

01:07:06.691 --> 01:07:08.411
- Hold my hand!
- Not!

01:07:08.488 --> 01:07:10.372
- You've got to!
- Not!

01:07:10.397 --> 01:07:11.822
- You...
- That's because the medallion of Croolik!

01:07:11.881 --> 01:07:13.516
Believe him.

01:07:13.989 --> 01:07:16.303
- I got it!
- Hold, Chic!

01:07:22.302 --> 01:07:24.373
Thank you.

01:07:27.219 --> 01:07:29.092
Caution!

01:07:54.946 --> 01:07:57.321
Still very young!

01:08:00.391 --> 01:08:04.591
We will face the same fate if
animals were not returned.

01:08:21.917 --> 01:08:24.532
I brought you something.

01:08:27.361 --> 01:08:30.261
Medicines made from Black Laiken.

01:08:30.286 --> 01:08:32.139
You know, Mipoulok.

01:08:32.163 --> 01:08:36.140
All people are not allowed to see me.

01:08:36.166 --> 01:08:40.410
- Even yourself.
- I do not want to die, I am.

01:08:43.251 --> 01:08:47.689
- I've been dreaming about Markussi.
- Really?

01:08:47.732 --> 01:08:55.541
You and up  Markussi large sled drawn
so many dogs.

01:08:56.982 --> 01:09:02.582
Sled it up towards the sky.
Fly towards the star.

01:09:02.606 --> 01:09:06.424
Oh! You can dream all you want about Markussi.

01:09:06.448 --> 01:09:09.741
Only there you can see it!

01:09:09.765 --> 01:09:14.425
Markussi your already buried under the snow.

01:09:15.131 --> 01:09:17.600
You're so cruel!

01:09:28.805 --> 01:09:31.425
- How?
- It Markussi!

01:09:34.661 --> 01:09:37.868
It is not possible!
No way!

01:09:41.687 --> 01:09:43.500
Chic?

01:09:43.524 --> 01:09:47.470
You and Markussi is
best friend I ever had.

01:09:47.496 --> 01:09:50.149
So I can say this honestly.

01:09:50.175 --> 01:09:52.968
I think we both should not be bound by the promise of long
.

01:09:52.993 --> 01:09:54.864
- Poutulik...
- Not!

01:09:54.889 --> 01:09:57.038
Do not say anything.

01:09:57.063 --> 01:09:59.125
I understand.

01:09:59.150 --> 01:10:00.960
And I agree.

01:10:02.952 --> 01:10:05.074
Charmingly little...

01:10:10.909 --> 01:10:14.962
- I see you hunt goes smoothly.
- Yes.

01:10:14.963 --> 01:10:18.905
- And I've changed.
- No longer stubborn?

01:10:18.930 --> 01:10:21.193
I would not say so.

01:10:21.218 --> 01:10:24.586
Poutulik and I was no longer bound to each other
promise.

01:10:24.999 --> 01:10:27.604
- But...
- Tradition no problem, Mom.

01:10:27.629 --> 01:10:29.155
But...

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:32.534
But we also have to listen to our conscience
.

01:10:41.950 --> 01:10:44.363
This, Dad.

01:10:44.388 --> 01:10:46.508
It's yours now, kid.

01:10:46.533 --> 01:10:49.333
You have proven that you are a true hunter.

01:10:49.404 --> 01:10:50.404
Thanks

01:10:50.483 --> 01:10:53.554
- This will assist in the journey.
- Journey?

01:10:53.579 --> 01:10:55.011
You might not directly go?

01:10:55.012 --> 01:10:57.279
I have found that this is the way
and knowledge.

01:10:57.288 --> 01:11:00.656
I want to learn another way.
So I would be better.

01:11:00.681 --> 01:11:03.614
I will come back as a better chairman.

01:11:05.304 --> 01:11:07.494
Mipoulok!

01:11:07.939 --> 01:11:09.814
My little brother!

01:11:10.339 --> 01:11:12.471
Oh, Markussi!

01:11:12.496 --> 01:11:16.341
- I miss you!
- I will never leave you again.

01:11:16.366 --> 01:11:18.537
I promise!

01:11:18.945 --> 01:11:21.089
Where am I?

01:11:31.722 --> 01:11:34.742
Markussi, you are damned!
Depart from me!

01:11:34.757 --> 01:11:38.728
Get out from before thee?
You have been blinded by evil!

01:11:38.753 --> 01:11:44.201
Oh, Poutulik!
What are you doing with that rat?

01:11:44.274 --> 01:11:46.352
Come here, my friend.

01:11:46.377 --> 01:11:48.505
Accept return the medallion damned!

01:11:48.530 --> 01:11:50.322
- It does not have the power!
- Oh...

01:11:50.407 --> 01:11:53.582
But I still have the strength.
I am the Shaman.

01:11:53.582 --> 01:11:56.075
The spirits are on my side.

01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:01.510
How many times have you tried to kill me?
And how many times did you fail?

01:12:01.535 --> 01:12:04.746
For your own good,
go now, Shaman!

01:12:04.746 --> 01:12:06.589
Oh no!

01:12:06.614 --> 01:12:08.654
We will end this now!

01:12:08.679 --> 01:12:10.631
Line of sight!

01:12:10.656 --> 01:12:12.056
Do not mind him, Markussi!

01:12:12.081 --> 01:12:16.238
Not! Sedna tells that Shaman
know what to do.

01:12:16.263 --> 01:12:18.763
At that time I did not understand, now I understand.

01:12:18.846 --> 01:12:21.494
Do you think Sedna can protect you?

01:12:21.519 --> 01:12:26.281
Thungalukh, Spirit of Darkness,
Lead hand!

01:12:35.469 --> 01:12:37.599
Ah, yes!

01:12:42.295 --> 01:12:46.115
Aeekhlawae khummalook isidiyou ouramatakaiyae

01:12:46.174 --> 01:12:48.494
Thungalukh, the Spirit of Darkness!

01:12:48.521 --> 01:12:53.127
Avenge revenge!
Kill the cheeky boy!

01:13:05.922 --> 01:13:12.638
- The storm will kill him!
- A true Shaman is able to beat the storm!

01:13:55.273 --> 01:13:57.477
I...

01:13:57.802 --> 01:14:00.704
- I...
- Do not talk!

01:14:00.729 --> 01:14:04.028
I who took the food supply.

01:14:05.636 --> 01:14:07.542
I'm sorry...

01:14:13.623 --> 01:14:18.496
Dream beautiful, Croolik.

01:14:22.681 --> 01:14:24.681
Even if you do not find happiness in this world...

01:14:24.694 --> 01:14:29.528
... hopefully refreshing water softness
inspires you in the next world.

01:15:04.567 --> 01:15:06.285
Sedna...

01:15:06.610 --> 01:15:09.284
... please accept our giving.

01:15:14.542 --> 01:15:19.574
Thank you, Markussi.
Your clan already forgiven.

01:15:19.599 --> 01:15:23.808
Long live to the new Shaman
!

01:15:27.635 --> 01:15:30.633
- We did it!
- No, Shaman.

01:15:30.658 --> 01:15:32.419
You are successful!

01:15:32.444 --> 01:15:35.957
Yeahhh... Markussi!...

01:16:00.839 --> 01:16:03.887
- Tell a story for us.
- We actually buried in the snow.

01:16:03.918 --> 01:16:07.338
Starting difficulty breathing.
I am sure we all will die.

01:16:07.374 --> 01:16:11.394
Then? How did you get out?
You dig to be free?

01:16:11.434 --> 01:16:14.454
How is it possible? We do not know where the top
where the bottom.

01:16:14.503 --> 01:16:16.023
We get lost in the darkness.

01:16:16.112 --> 01:16:18.432
Lemming We heard a roar like seals.

01:16:18.486 --> 01:16:21.286
So we dug to the sound of the roar.

01:16:30.728 --> 01:16:35.746
Hah! Kwatak really clever crow.
He ​​found a new master.

01:16:35.771 --> 01:16:37.693
I do not need Kwatak.

01:16:37.718 --> 01:16:40.739
I already have Kimi to take care of me.

01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:47.350
So... what would we do with Kwatak
?

01:16:47.403 --> 01:16:51.439
My wife has tasty recipes crow.
