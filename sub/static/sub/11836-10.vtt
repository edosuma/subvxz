WEBVTT

00:00.902 --> 00:02.606
DOLE: Previously on
"The Practice"...

00:02.639 --> 00:03.641
STRINGER: Okay.

00:03.674 --> 00:05.110
The search seems to be bogus.

00:05.143 --> 00:07.816
She was pulled over for
rolling through a stop sign.

00:07.849 --> 00:08.951
Who's sitting? Do you know?

00:08.984 --> 00:10.788
Judge Brenford. Why?

00:10.822 --> 00:11.624
You're home.

00:11.657 --> 00:12.526
I'm sorry?

00:12.559 --> 00:14.630
Brenford is the flirting judge

00:14.663 --> 00:16.834
and you've got blonde hair.

00:16.867 --> 00:19.806
All you have to do
is smile at him,

00:19.840 --> 00:22.010
big smile, over the top.

00:22.410 --> 00:24.950
If he thinks you think
he's cute,

00:24.983 --> 00:26.687
he'll suppress on the spot.

00:26.720 --> 00:27.789
What?

00:27.822 --> 00:29.926
Your Honor, we'd like to,

00:29.960 --> 00:31.462
you know, waive reading,

00:31.495 --> 00:32.631
if that's all right?

00:32.665 --> 00:34.034
Why are you so happy?

00:34.068 --> 00:37.074
Just happy to be here,
Your Honor.

00:37.107 --> 00:38.242
Are you coming onto me?

00:38.678 --> 00:39.646
STRINGER: I would never,

00:39.680 --> 00:42.050
as hard as it is to resist.

00:46.258 --> 00:47.996
I cannot believe you did that.

00:48.029 --> 00:49.031
It was a joke, Jamie.

00:49.064 --> 00:49.766
Calm down.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.202
You humiliated me!

00:51.235 --> 00:54.208
I'm gonna let what little doubt
I have cut in your favor.

00:54.241 --> 00:55.511
I'm suppressing the search

00:55.544 --> 00:56.780
and dismissing the indictment.

00:56.814 --> 00:58.049
(gavel bangs)

00:59.519 --> 01:00.393
Excellent.

01:06.974 --> 01:08.644
You're telling me this now?

01:08.677 --> 01:11.684
Normally, we like to present
a united front,

01:11.717 --> 01:14.623
but Ellenor feels strongly
that we should plead and--

01:14.656 --> 01:16.827
Why?
FRUTT: Basically, the media.

01:16.860 --> 01:20.233
On the evidence alone,
I think our chances are okay,

01:20.266 --> 01:21.870
but the press is killing you.

01:21.904 --> 01:24.274
You're already guilty
in the public's eye.

01:24.308 --> 01:27.581
Jurors are instructed
to disregard

01:27.616 --> 01:28.918
what they see and hear.

01:28.951 --> 01:31.055
FRUTT: Of course
they are, but...

01:31.088 --> 01:35.665
these images have been on
every broadcast every night.

01:35.698 --> 01:37.000
Look at the pictures.

01:37.034 --> 01:38.638
I don't need to see
them again.

01:38.671 --> 01:42.044
FRUTT: Steven, to the extent
that you're in denial,

01:42.077 --> 01:43.446
I think you do.

01:44.048 --> 01:47.020
I want you to really look.

01:47.054 --> 01:49.793
(music playing)

01:53.868 --> 01:55.571
FRUTT: For the past week

01:55.604 --> 01:58.342
leading every broadcast.

01:58.376 --> 02:00.788
I'm getting a very
bad feeling.

02:10.039 --> 02:12.377
But you think we can win this?

02:12.410 --> 02:14.048
The case is circumstantial.

02:14.081 --> 02:16.754
On the evidence,
I think we have a shot.

02:16.787 --> 02:18.691
Then I'm going with you.

02:19.959 --> 02:21.195
No plea.

02:26.506 --> 02:30.547
(music playing)

03:16.814 --> 03:18.951
Kathy and I
met freshman year.

03:18.984 --> 03:21.556
She lived on my hall
in one of the dorms.

03:21.589 --> 03:24.394
After that, we got an
apartment off campus.

03:24.428 --> 03:26.566
She was my best friend
for four years.

03:26.599 --> 03:31.075
Amy, why did you go see
Dr. Barrett?

03:31.108 --> 03:33.446
Well, we both decided
to get breast implants

03:33.479 --> 03:35.517
as kind of a
graduation present.

03:35.752 --> 03:38.189
We talked to a bunch
of different doctors,

03:38.222 --> 03:40.627
but Kathy and Steven
had this connection.

03:40.661 --> 03:42.064
GAMBLE: They were a couple.

03:42.097 --> 03:45.571
AMY: Oh, yes, even though
he was married.

03:45.838 --> 03:48.376
At first, it was just
for the surgery,

03:48.409 --> 03:50.748
but Kathy had a thing
about older guys.

03:50.782 --> 03:52.484
GAMBLE: How often did you
see them together?

03:52.518 --> 03:53.788
AMY: All the time.

03:53.821 --> 03:55.724
They went out at least
a few nights a week.

03:55.758 --> 03:58.931
She was always talking about
the restaurants they went to

03:58.964 --> 04:01.308
or how great it was
at his house on the cape.

04:01.342 --> 04:03.948
She said they were in love.

04:03.981 --> 04:05.383
Did you ever see
them fight?

04:05.416 --> 04:08.791
AMY: I saw them
argue a lot.

04:08.824 --> 04:11.529
The last time was a few nights
before she was killed.

04:11.563 --> 04:13.901
Could you hear what they
were fighting about?

04:13.934 --> 04:16.005
AMY: The same thing
they always did.

04:16.038 --> 04:19.678
Kathy wanted Steven
to get a divorce.

04:19.712 --> 04:22.050
I didn't hear everything

04:22.084 --> 04:23.620
but it was bad.

04:23.653 --> 04:25.156
She slapped him,

04:25.190 --> 04:26.927
and she told him
to get the hell out.

04:28.964 --> 04:31.837
Two days later,
she was dead.

04:33.206 --> 04:36.145
You never heard my client
threaten Ms. Vance, did you?

04:36.178 --> 04:37.080
No.

04:37.113 --> 04:37.915
YOUNG: You never saw
him hit her

04:37.949 --> 04:40.086
or be violent with her
in any way?

04:40.119 --> 04:40.988
AMY: No.

04:41.022 --> 04:42.157
YOUNG: And when you saw
Ms. Vance

04:42.190 --> 04:44.261
slap Dr. Barrett,

04:44.294 --> 04:46.098
how did he respond to that?

04:46.132 --> 04:47.434
He didn't.

04:47.467 --> 04:49.071
He didn't lose his temper?

04:49.104 --> 04:50.406
He didn't hit her back?

04:50.440 --> 04:52.778
No, he just turned around
and walked out.

04:53.146 --> 04:54.615
YOUNG: Could you tell us
how you heard

04:54.649 --> 04:56.854
that Ms. Vance
had been killed?

04:56.887 --> 04:59.424
I got a phone call from Steven
the day she was found.

04:59.458 --> 05:01.536
Then how did he sound
when you talked to him?

05:01.569 --> 05:03.106
He was crying.

05:03.139 --> 05:05.343
In your opinion,
he was devastated.

05:05.376 --> 05:06.947
Isn't that what you told
the police?

05:08.717 --> 05:09.652
Yes.

05:11.689 --> 05:15.330
(indistinct chatter)

05:15.363 --> 05:17.000
(alarm buzzes)

05:30.527 --> 05:32.430
Thank you so much
for coming.

05:32.464 --> 05:34.134
Well, you left me
six messages.

05:35.270 --> 05:37.040
You are such
a beautiful woman.

05:38.009 --> 05:40.213
The newspapers
make you look fatter.

05:40.246 --> 05:43.386
Mr. Deeks--
I really needed to see you.

05:43.419 --> 05:44.388
You're the only lawyer
who could--

05:44.421 --> 05:46.526
DOLE: Mr. Deeks,
I need to stop you.

05:46.559 --> 05:49.364
I read your indictment
and the court file.

05:49.398 --> 05:51.669
I'm sorry. I'm not taking any
criminal cases anymore,

05:51.703 --> 05:53.406
especially murder cases.

05:55.310 --> 05:56.546
There are many
other lawyers who--

05:56.579 --> 05:58.984
DEEKS: Not like you.

06:00.594 --> 06:01.897
Why am I different?

06:02.464 --> 06:03.901
You killed somebody.

06:05.003 --> 06:07.775
You can understand

06:07.808 --> 06:10.046
what it feels like.
And it's in part

06:10.080 --> 06:11.315
because I'm still
trying to deal with--

06:11.348 --> 06:13.820
I killed somebody.

06:16.158 --> 06:17.394
I took a life.

06:19.464 --> 06:23.406
I need someone
who understands.

06:24.642 --> 06:26.212
Why?

06:26.412 --> 06:29.051
Because...

06:29.084 --> 06:31.589
I know there's something
wrong with me,

06:33.392 --> 06:36.766
something that just
told me to do it.

06:36.799 --> 06:40.841
I know it's not the same
as what you did,

06:40.874 --> 06:44.014
but if anyone can understand...

06:44.048 --> 06:45.784
look.

06:45.817 --> 06:47.487
I don't wanna go to jail
for the rest of my life.

06:47.521 --> 06:51.095
If I could get into
a hospital--

06:51.128 --> 06:54.101
I don't have much money

06:56.272 --> 06:59.244
but I'll pay you...

06:59.278 --> 07:00.988
everything I have.

07:08.570 --> 07:09.404
Hi.

07:09.438 --> 07:10.807
You wanted to see me?

07:10.841 --> 07:12.611
Yes, I did.

07:14.114 --> 07:16.418
I meant to grab you
after last week's hearing.

07:17.721 --> 07:19.859
I wanted you to know that
after a rather shaky start,

07:19.892 --> 07:21.829
I thought that you, uh,

07:21.863 --> 07:23.767
argued a persuasive motion.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.804
Thank you.

07:25.837 --> 07:27.575
This was my first
real victory.

07:27.608 --> 07:30.346
So I'm feeling excellent.

07:30.380 --> 07:32.518
BRENFORD:
Yeah, a difficult issue,

07:32.551 --> 07:35.190
one on which I could
have gone either way.

07:35.223 --> 07:37.227
Most judges, I might add,

07:37.260 --> 07:38.830
probably would have gone
the other way.

07:38.863 --> 07:42.270
STRINGER: Oh, well,
I'm glad for my side that--

07:42.304 --> 07:43.139
You got me.

07:43.640 --> 07:44.609
(chuckles)

07:45.711 --> 07:47.515
I thought perhaps you might
like to grab some lunch.

07:49.084 --> 07:51.956
Um, wouldn't that be,

07:51.990 --> 07:53.426
like, uh...

07:53.459 --> 07:54.895
incredibly improper?

07:55.931 --> 07:57.234
The case is over.

07:57.267 --> 08:00.106
I take great pride
in mentoring young lawyers.

08:00.140 --> 08:01.749
It's not something
that's done often enough

08:01.783 --> 08:02.986
in the legal community.

08:03.486 --> 08:05.423
Well--

08:05.456 --> 08:06.759
I can't order you.

08:06.793 --> 08:08.530
That would be an abuse
of my discretion.

08:08.563 --> 08:11.235
So let's just call it
a request.

08:16.779 --> 08:18.449
DETECTIVE: The defendant
himself notified us

08:18.482 --> 08:20.453
that the victim was missing.

08:20.486 --> 08:23.459
Upon locating her car not
far from his office,

08:23.492 --> 08:25.396
we conducted an area search.

08:25.430 --> 08:28.001
Detective, could you tell us
what you found?

08:28.036 --> 08:30.173
DETECTIVE: In a wooded area
behind the building,

08:30.206 --> 08:31.809
we located the body
of the victim.

08:31.843 --> 08:33.145
Identified as...

08:33.179 --> 08:34.715
DETECTIVE: Katherine Vance.

08:34.749 --> 08:37.788
She had multiple stab wounds
around her chest

08:37.821 --> 08:39.825
and defensive cuts
on both of her hands.

08:40.226 --> 08:41.663
The body was naked.

08:41.696 --> 08:44.535
So we requested a rape kit
be sent to the lab.

08:44.569 --> 08:46.773
Do you know the result
of those tests?

08:46.806 --> 08:49.278
It was positive for semen
inside the victim.

08:49.311 --> 08:51.883
The sample was a genetic
match to the defendant.

08:53.620 --> 08:54.789
YOUNG: My client told you
he was involved

08:54.822 --> 08:57.127
with Katherine Vance.
Yes.

08:57.160 --> 08:58.763
YOUNG: That they were having
sexual relations.

08:58.797 --> 08:59.799
Yes.

08:59.832 --> 09:01.709
So she could have been
killed by some stranger

09:01.743 --> 09:04.348
after having sex
with my client.

09:04.381 --> 09:05.584
Is that possible,
detective?

09:05.617 --> 09:07.254
Anything is possible.
That doesn't mean--

09:07.287 --> 09:08.256
YOUNG: Thank you.

09:08.289 --> 09:09.825
Did you find
the murder weapon?

09:09.859 --> 09:11.362
No, the knife
was never recovered.

09:11.395 --> 09:13.099
YOUNG: And what about
the victim's blood?

09:13.132 --> 09:14.835
Could you connect it
with my client?

09:14.869 --> 09:16.072
No.

09:16.172 --> 09:18.843
YOUNG: So you searched
his office, his house,

09:18.877 --> 09:21.182
his car, his clothes.

09:21.215 --> 09:24.321
Did you find any trace
of the victim's blood?

09:24.354 --> 09:25.691
No.

09:25.724 --> 09:27.795
Does it make sense to you,
detective,

09:27.828 --> 09:29.899
that he would be so
meticulous about the blood

09:29.932 --> 09:32.370
and physical evidence
only to dump the body

09:32.404 --> 09:34.274
right behind
his own office building?

09:34.308 --> 09:36.112
Murders don't typically
make sense.

09:36.145 --> 09:37.948
He called the police.

09:37.981 --> 09:39.785
He led you to her car.

09:39.819 --> 09:43.226
He gave you a sample
of his own DNA.

09:43.259 --> 09:44.562
All true?

09:44.595 --> 09:45.931
Yes.

09:48.570 --> 09:50.373
You understand I confessed.

09:50.406 --> 09:52.945
I do, but you only
confessed after

09:52.978 --> 09:55.049
they discovered the body
in the trunk.

09:55.082 --> 09:56.819
If we can suppress
the search,

09:56.853 --> 09:58.790
the confession
goes out, too.

09:58.823 --> 10:00.634
That would give us some
leverage to make a deal,

10:00.667 --> 10:04.642
which we would need
to get you in a hospital.

10:04.675 --> 10:05.777
Are you with me?

10:06.212 --> 10:08.116
You can undo my confession?

10:08.149 --> 10:09.351
Maybe.

10:09.585 --> 10:11.756
But I'm willing to confess
if that is what--

10:11.789 --> 10:14.093
DOLE: I understand,
but the problem with that

10:14.128 --> 10:17.300
is we would be left
with no bargaining power.

10:17.334 --> 10:18.637
Can you appreciate that?

10:19.404 --> 10:20.641
Yes.

10:20.674 --> 10:22.678
I just don't wanna go
to a prison.

10:22.711 --> 10:25.115
Anything to keep me out
of prison.

10:25.150 --> 10:26.385
DOLE: I understand.

10:28.523 --> 10:31.262
Now, you answer
only what I ask you,

10:31.295 --> 10:32.565
nothing more, because--

10:32.598 --> 10:34.434
I strangled her.

10:35.971 --> 10:39.378
Stanley,
I know you're ill,

10:39.411 --> 10:41.248
and I know you
wanna get better.

10:41.282 --> 10:42.350
Carol.

10:44.321 --> 10:45.423
I'm sorry?

10:45.456 --> 10:48.362
Her name was Carol.

10:48.396 --> 10:50.634
She worked in my building.

10:51.034 --> 10:53.105
She was very nice to me.

10:53.138 --> 10:56.111
I was a security guard
and I killed her.

10:58.015 --> 11:00.085
Listen to me.

11:00.119 --> 11:02.898
I will never succeed
in keeping you out of prison

11:02.931 --> 11:04.234
if you don't do as I say.

11:05.737 --> 11:07.575
Do not be telling anybody else

11:07.608 --> 11:09.178
you strangled this girl.

11:10.514 --> 11:11.883
Are we clear?

11:14.989 --> 11:16.325
Okay.

11:26.148 --> 11:27.918
You're the D. A. on this?

11:27.951 --> 11:30.156
Perfect, isn't it?

11:30.189 --> 11:31.525
I graduate to the rubber room

11:31.558 --> 11:32.828
after trying to put you away.

11:32.861 --> 11:34.998
One month on the happy farm,
I'm back,

11:35.032 --> 11:38.639
only to find myself
up against--boom.

11:38.672 --> 11:40.276
Oh, that's what I call you.

11:40.309 --> 11:42.613
I used to give my defendants
a one word moniker.

11:42.647 --> 11:43.883
It's how I kept track.

11:43.916 --> 11:47.123
My name for you was "boom"

11:47.157 --> 11:48.625
since you were a shooter.

11:48.659 --> 11:50.129
I see. Listen--

11:50.163 --> 11:51.665
WALSH:
Now, I call you "techie"

11:51.698 --> 11:54.104
since you got off
on a technicality.

11:54.137 --> 11:57.076
Which do you like better,
boom or techie?

12:02.293 --> 12:03.395
Lindsay...

12:04.898 --> 12:07.036
I'm sort of half kidding.

12:07.069 --> 12:10.409
I'm trying to make light
of my situation

12:10.443 --> 12:12.413
because I'm...

12:12.613 --> 12:15.987
so deeply embarrassed
over, uh--

12:17.257 --> 12:21.899
listen, I'm not gonna
give you a hug,

12:21.932 --> 12:25.273
but I'll try to be fair

12:25.306 --> 12:28.078
and more importantly,

12:28.112 --> 12:30.950
a noble officer
of the court....

12:32.553 --> 12:33.722
really.

12:37.597 --> 12:38.699
Walsh?

12:38.732 --> 12:41.070
Why would they put one
of their top people on this?

12:41.105 --> 12:42.807
DOLE: Stanley,
this is a murder case.

12:42.840 --> 12:44.277
You strangled somebody.

12:44.311 --> 12:46.949
Look, I'll confess.

12:46.982 --> 12:48.185
Don't start that again.

12:48.219 --> 12:51.090
He is gonna go for prison.

12:51.125 --> 12:53.429
Calm down.

12:53.462 --> 12:55.233
What if...

12:55.399 --> 12:58.305
I can give them
other information

12:58.339 --> 13:00.683
I can trade in exchange

13:00.716 --> 13:02.620
for getting in a hospital

13:02.653 --> 13:04.291
instead of jail?

13:05.859 --> 13:07.463
What other information?

13:07.998 --> 13:10.203
I did other things...

13:11.805 --> 13:13.142
that they don't know about.

13:13.175 --> 13:14.877
I don't wanna know
about it either.

13:16.080 --> 13:18.885
Look, let's tackle
the suppression hearing

13:18.920 --> 13:21.825
and then go from there, okay?

13:23.695 --> 13:24.564
Carol.

13:24.897 --> 13:25.899
What?

13:28.105 --> 13:30.243
Her name was Carol.

13:37.723 --> 13:40.028
I don't deny
having the affair.

13:40.062 --> 13:41.631
Doctor, did you see
Kathy Vance

13:41.665 --> 13:43.169
the night she was killed?

13:43.202 --> 13:44.704
STEVEN: Yes, she stopped
by the office.

13:44.737 --> 13:46.675
That's where
we would often meet.

13:46.708 --> 13:49.681
I work there at night
when the staff is gone and--

13:49.714 --> 13:50.649
Can you tell us
what happened

13:50.683 --> 13:51.918
that particular night?

13:52.120 --> 13:54.124
STEVEN: She came
by a little after 9:00,

13:54.824 --> 13:57.463
hung around while
I finished some work.

13:57.497 --> 14:00.676
After that, we opened up
a bottle of wine.

14:00.709 --> 14:01.911
We made love.

14:01.946 --> 14:02.847
In the office?

14:02.880 --> 14:03.582
Yes.

14:03.615 --> 14:05.186
FRUTT: And after?

14:05.219 --> 14:07.723
She left. She said
she had a party to go to.

14:08.058 --> 14:09.294
I walked her to the door.

14:09.327 --> 14:11.966
We said goodbye and that was...

14:11.999 --> 14:14.003
the last time that I saw her.

14:14.036 --> 14:16.141
When did you realize
something was wrong?

14:16.175 --> 14:18.512
STEVEN: Later that night
when I left to go home,

14:18.545 --> 14:20.649
I saw her car was still
in the parking lot.

14:20.683 --> 14:22.620
I knew that it
didn't make any sense,

14:22.653 --> 14:26.027
but I thought perhaps
she got a ride from a friend,

14:26.060 --> 14:28.965
so it didn't really bother me.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.371
The next day,
her car was still there.

14:31.405 --> 14:32.373
And what did you do?

14:32.407 --> 14:34.043
STEVEN:
Now, I got concerned.

14:34.076 --> 14:35.613
I called her roommate,
Amy Wyatt.

14:35.646 --> 14:38.852
She told me that Kathy
hadn't been home all night.

14:38.885 --> 14:40.123
I hung up the phone.

14:40.156 --> 14:43.329
I immediately called
the police.

14:43.362 --> 14:45.499
They found her
later that day.

14:45.533 --> 14:48.639
FRUTT: Dr. Barrett,
did you kill Kathy Vance?

14:49.641 --> 14:51.378
No.

14:51.411 --> 14:54.484
I cared
about Kathy very much.

14:54.517 --> 14:56.921
I have done everything
in my power

14:56.955 --> 14:57.923
to help the police.

14:58.625 --> 15:01.105
I swear, I don't know
what happened to her.

15:02.807 --> 15:04.577
I wish to God that I did.

15:14.497 --> 15:16.635
GAMBLE: You recognize
this bottle, doctor?

15:16.668 --> 15:18.872
It looks like a prescription
bottle for painkillers.

15:19.974 --> 15:23.449
A prescription you wrote
for Katherine Vance, correct?

15:23.482 --> 15:26.355
Yes. Kathy was still
experiencing some discomfort.

15:26.388 --> 15:28.559
Pain medication
was an appropriate treatment.

15:28.592 --> 15:30.729
Well, according to her
autopsy results,

15:30.763 --> 15:32.900
she wasn't taking
any pain medication.

15:32.933 --> 15:36.006
In fact, there were
no medications

15:36.040 --> 15:37.410
found in her system.

15:37.443 --> 15:39.481
STEVEN: I don't know
why that would be.

15:39.514 --> 15:41.518
GAMBLE: Doctor,
this bottle is half empty.

15:41.551 --> 15:44.991
It was found in your desk
in your office.

15:45.024 --> 15:46.060
She must have left
them there.

15:46.094 --> 15:47.463
GAMBLE: Well,
I'm sure she did because

15:47.497 --> 15:49.701
you were the one
who was taking the pills.

15:49.734 --> 15:52.005
That's absolutely false.

15:52.038 --> 15:55.044
(music playing)

15:56.681 --> 15:58.419
GAMBLE: I have here

15:58.452 --> 16:02.633
seven prescriptions
written by you,

16:02.667 --> 16:04.904
all in the name
of Katherine Vance.

16:04.937 --> 16:07.843
They were all filled
in different locations,

16:07.877 --> 16:09.981
all in the last few months.

16:12.853 --> 16:15.493
Why so many prescriptions,
doctor?

16:17.563 --> 16:20.769
We also ran some new tests

16:20.803 --> 16:23.007
on your blood sample.

16:23.040 --> 16:26.215
Would you care to amend
your answer now, doctor?

16:30.423 --> 16:32.293
Okay.

16:32.327 --> 16:35.266
Look, I have a problem.

16:36.435 --> 16:38.272
She was getting
the pills for me,

16:39.307 --> 16:42.613
but you're talking about
my addiction.

16:44.151 --> 16:46.155
That doesn't make me
a murderer.

16:55.673 --> 16:57.643
Why didn't you tell us,
Steven?

17:00.149 --> 17:02.025
I'm sorry.

17:02.058 --> 17:03.895
I was trying
to protect myself.

17:06.066 --> 17:07.837
I knew how it would look.

17:08.905 --> 17:10.976
Now, I'm with Ellenor.

17:11.009 --> 17:13.348
We need to think
about taking a plea.

17:13.382 --> 17:16.221
A plea of what?

17:16.755 --> 17:17.757
Murder two.

17:20.628 --> 17:22.333
I didn't kill anyone.

17:22.367 --> 17:24.537
But it looks
very much like you did.

17:25.373 --> 17:27.142
You were last seen with her,

17:27.176 --> 17:29.045
your semen was found in her,

17:29.079 --> 17:30.416
and she was in the woods

17:30.449 --> 17:32.453
behind your office.

17:32.487 --> 17:35.193
Someone killed her

17:35.226 --> 17:37.230
after she left the office.

17:37.663 --> 17:39.801
FRUTT: Steven,
we put you up there

17:39.834 --> 17:42.573
so you would look like
a responsible doctor,

17:42.607 --> 17:44.711
the kind of person incapable

17:44.744 --> 17:46.615
of committing a crime.

17:47.217 --> 17:49.085
You came off that stand

17:49.120 --> 17:50.789
a drug-addicted liar.

17:52.126 --> 17:54.264
I agree with Eugene.

17:54.297 --> 17:58.037
We at least have to think
about a plea.

17:58.070 --> 18:00.676
I didn't kill her, Ellenor.

18:02.587 --> 18:04.224
That's the truth.

18:08.765 --> 18:11.036
I'm not gonna plead
to second-degree murder.

18:18.151 --> 18:19.186
(sighs)

18:20.523 --> 18:22.260
What do you mean
you had lunch with him?

18:22.393 --> 18:23.495
I just--

18:23.529 --> 18:25.366
BERLUTI: The judge who
just handled your motion?

18:25.399 --> 18:26.601
Yes.

18:26.635 --> 18:28.505
He asked me yesterday.

18:28.539 --> 18:31.978
I felt I better not refuse.

18:32.011 --> 18:34.015
You better not refuse?

18:34.049 --> 18:35.353
STRINGER:
He said it was a request,

18:35.386 --> 18:37.290
but he said it in a way

18:37.323 --> 18:40.027
like there would be
repercussions.

18:40.061 --> 18:41.731
So you went to lunch.

18:41.765 --> 18:42.833
STRINGER: Yes.

18:42.867 --> 18:43.902
And what happened?

18:43.935 --> 18:45.573
Nothing. We had lunch, uh,

18:45.606 --> 18:47.008
talked about the law.

18:47.041 --> 18:49.681
It seemed pretty innocent
and then it was over.

18:52.787 --> 18:54.691
And then he asked me out
for a drink.

18:54.724 --> 18:55.859
And what did you say?

18:55.893 --> 18:56.895
I said I couldn't.

18:56.928 --> 18:58.899
I had work and...

19:01.411 --> 19:02.947
"maybe tomorrow."

19:02.980 --> 19:04.284
Would you like me
to go to him?

19:04.317 --> 19:06.821
No. God. No.

19:06.855 --> 19:10.596
Well, this is
a treacherous thing.

19:10.629 --> 19:13.033
The last thing a young
attorney needs--

19:13.067 --> 19:14.304
I'll call it off.

19:14.337 --> 19:16.073
You want me to go with you?

19:16.107 --> 19:17.643
No.

19:17.677 --> 19:19.514
I will tell him no.

19:23.154 --> 19:25.593
I saw a vehicle stopped
on the side of the road.

19:25.626 --> 19:27.162
At first, I thought it
was a police car

19:27.196 --> 19:28.699
because of the lights
on the roof

19:28.732 --> 19:30.168
and the way it was painted.

19:30.202 --> 19:31.905
Did you see anyone near
the vehicle?

19:31.938 --> 19:33.141
The defendant.

19:33.174 --> 19:35.077
He was in what looked like
a policeman's uniform

19:35.112 --> 19:36.748
and was standing
at the rear of the car.

19:36.781 --> 19:38.752
The trunk was open,
and he had a flashlight,

19:38.785 --> 19:40.956
so I assumed he was trying
to change a flat tire.

19:40.989 --> 19:42.560
What did you do?
I pulled over myself

19:42.593 --> 19:44.029
to see if I could help.

19:44.062 --> 19:45.866
That's when I realized
he wasn't one of us.

19:45.899 --> 19:48.572
He was a security guard
for a private company.

19:48.605 --> 19:51.043
And what happened after
you saw him, officer?

19:51.076 --> 19:52.913
Well, the minute he saw me,
he slammed the trunk

19:52.947 --> 19:54.484
like he didn't want me
to see inside.

19:54.784 --> 19:56.521
So naturally,
I got suspicious.

19:56.555 --> 19:57.790
I asked him,
"What's going on?"

19:57.823 --> 19:59.661
He told me he was just
having a cigarette.

19:59.694 --> 20:01.571
Company wouldn't allow him
to smoke in the car,

20:01.605 --> 20:03.108
only I didn't see any
cigarettes.

20:03.141 --> 20:05.946
He was acting in a furtive
and suspicious manner?

20:05.979 --> 20:07.817
Objection.
Sustained.

20:07.850 --> 20:09.321
Were you afraid
he might go for a weapon?

20:09.354 --> 20:10.188
Objection.

20:10.222 --> 20:11.525
Mr. Walsh...

20:12.360 --> 20:15.132
HOPE: I tried to follow up
with a few more questions,

20:15.165 --> 20:16.968
where he worked,
what shift he was on,

20:17.001 --> 20:18.772
only he wouldn't say anything.

20:18.805 --> 20:21.511
He just stood there
and then he tried to leave.

20:21.545 --> 20:22.547
Did you let him go?

20:22.813 --> 20:24.617
No, I could tell
something was wrong.

20:24.651 --> 20:27.523
So I asked him to open up
the trunk and he did.

20:27.557 --> 20:28.859
And what was in the trunk?

20:28.892 --> 20:31.565
HOPE: I found a woman, a body.

20:31.598 --> 20:34.002
It was lying on its side
in a curled up position.

20:34.035 --> 20:36.541
There were bruises
all around the neck,

20:36.575 --> 20:38.712
the apparent victim
of strangulation.

20:38.745 --> 20:41.049
It was later I learned
it was Carol Dalton.

20:43.188 --> 20:45.393
You asked him to open
the trunk or told him to?

20:45.426 --> 20:46.561
It was a request.

20:46.595 --> 20:48.865
Where was your weapon?
It was drawn.

20:48.899 --> 20:50.436
So it was a request
while you were pointing

20:50.469 --> 20:51.371
a gun at him.

20:51.705 --> 20:52.773
Yes.

20:52.973 --> 20:54.042
DOLE: You didn't know
there was a body

20:54.075 --> 20:55.513
in the trunk, did you?

20:55.546 --> 20:57.349
Not before
he opened it, no.

20:57.383 --> 20:58.952
DOLE: Didn't see blood
on the car

20:58.985 --> 21:00.355
or the defendant's clothes?

21:00.389 --> 21:01.224
HOPE: No.

21:01.257 --> 21:02.733
DOLE: What about sounds
from inside?

21:02.767 --> 21:04.571
Did you hear screaming
or cries for help?

21:04.604 --> 21:06.575
Obviously not.
She was dead.

21:06.608 --> 21:09.514
So as I understand
your testimony,

21:09.547 --> 21:11.217
if he had had cigarettes,

21:11.250 --> 21:12.820
you wouldn't have searched
his trunk.

21:12.853 --> 21:14.891
That's not what I said.
I testified

21:14.924 --> 21:16.461
he was acting suspiciously.

21:16.495 --> 21:18.765
Because he didn't have
cigarettes and was evasive

21:18.799 --> 21:19.934
about where he worked.

21:19.967 --> 21:22.306
HOPE: He wouldn't answer
any of my questions.

21:22.339 --> 21:23.809
DOLE: So you searched
his trunk

21:23.842 --> 21:25.879
because he chose not to talk.

21:25.913 --> 21:28.519
Your client had a dead woman
in the trunk of his car.

21:28.552 --> 21:30.789
Bottom line, I was right.

21:30.823 --> 21:32.326
DOLE: Is it your testimony
when you asked him

21:32.359 --> 21:33.462
to open the trunk,

21:33.495 --> 21:35.766
you suspected
he had a dead woman inside?

21:35.799 --> 21:37.202
I knew he had something.

21:37.236 --> 21:39.441
DOLE: You knew he had something,

21:39.474 --> 21:41.009
just not cigarettes.

21:45.586 --> 21:46.955
Now what?

21:46.988 --> 21:48.792
We'll make summations
to the judge.

21:48.825 --> 21:50.395
If we win, like I said,

21:50.429 --> 21:51.364
we're in a position--

21:51.397 --> 21:52.700
What if we lose?

21:54.236 --> 21:57.910
Then we'll either plead
or go to trial.

21:58.712 --> 22:02.392
So maybe I have better
negotiation power now.

22:02.427 --> 22:05.097
Maybe we can make
a deal now.

22:05.132 --> 22:06.200
DOLE: Stanley,

22:06.601 --> 22:09.072
they're not willing
to deal now,

22:09.106 --> 22:10.342
and even if they were,

22:10.375 --> 22:12.379
you have good
fourth-amendment issues here.

22:13.314 --> 22:16.053
My advice would be
to play this hearing out.

22:17.523 --> 22:18.424
Okay.

22:21.698 --> 22:23.469
Okay.

22:24.303 --> 22:26.741
Commonwealth has one rebuttal
witness, Your Honor.

22:26.775 --> 22:29.213
We call Margot Barrett.
YOUNG: Objection.

22:29.246 --> 22:31.317
Margot Barrett enjoys
spousal privilege.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.787
The Commonwealth knows--
GAMBLE: And Mrs. Barrett

22:32.820 --> 22:34.456
has the right to exercise it,

22:34.491 --> 22:37.095
not Mr. Young's
or his client's.

22:37.129 --> 22:39.601
Margot Barrett
is willing to testify.

22:39.634 --> 22:41.805
She can't testify
about private conversations.

22:41.838 --> 22:43.341
That's not why
we're calling her.

22:43.475 --> 22:44.276
Approach.

22:50.122 --> 22:51.858
This is definitely
unfair surprise.

22:51.891 --> 22:53.128
She's on the witness list.

22:53.161 --> 22:54.196
YOUNG: Ours not yours.

22:54.230 --> 22:55.599
GAMBLE: Point is you're
prepared for her.

22:55.633 --> 22:56.535
No, we are not.

22:56.768 --> 22:58.304
Have you interviewed
this woman?

22:58.505 --> 22:59.373
Yes.

22:59.406 --> 23:00.676
Then what's the problem?

23:00.709 --> 23:02.587
The problem is it's unfair
surprise--

23:02.620 --> 23:05.091
GAMBLE: I'm only calling her
to impeach.

23:05.125 --> 23:05.993
WHITE: All right, look,

23:06.026 --> 23:07.897
we'll suspend for the day

23:07.930 --> 23:09.901
so defense can get ready.

23:09.934 --> 23:12.339
Tomorrow, we'll start
with Mrs. Barrett.

23:13.108 --> 23:14.443
Now step back.

23:15.679 --> 23:16.380
We're adjourned.

23:16.414 --> 23:17.081
(gavel bangs)

23:19.420 --> 23:20.923
What the hell
is she going to say?

23:20.956 --> 23:23.194
I have no idea.

23:23.228 --> 23:24.864
(music playing)

23:32.904 --> 23:34.307
DOLE: Your Honor,

23:34.340 --> 23:35.676
we can all guess

23:35.710 --> 23:37.880
that my client likely murdered

23:37.914 --> 23:39.984
a beautiful young woman

23:40.018 --> 23:41.154
and he went to that park

23:41.187 --> 23:42.356
to dispose of her body,

23:42.389 --> 23:44.460
but like it or not,

23:44.494 --> 23:46.131
that has nothing to do

23:46.164 --> 23:47.567
with this hearing.

23:48.101 --> 23:49.871
Officer Hope saw my client

23:49.904 --> 23:51.775
standing by his car.

23:51.808 --> 23:53.445
He didn't see any blood,

23:53.478 --> 23:54.948
didn't hear any screams,

23:54.981 --> 23:57.587
nothing to justify
searching the vehicle.

23:58.188 --> 24:01.134
Slamming a trunk
isn't probable cause.

24:01.167 --> 24:03.872
Refusing to talk
isn't probable cause.

24:03.906 --> 24:05.242
Acting nervous

24:05.275 --> 24:07.547
isn't probable cause.

24:08.281 --> 24:11.287
I know it offends
our sense of justice

24:11.321 --> 24:12.323
to free a man

24:12.356 --> 24:14.327
who has perhaps
committed murder,

24:14.360 --> 24:16.064
but the courts have said

24:16.097 --> 24:17.266
it offends us more

24:17.299 --> 24:18.769
to let the police get away

24:18.802 --> 24:21.241
with unreasonable searches.

24:22.276 --> 24:26.016
This is criminal procedure 101.

24:26.050 --> 24:27.720
WALSH: This search
was nothing,

24:27.754 --> 24:29.457
but reasonable.

24:29.490 --> 24:31.094
It was late at night

24:31.127 --> 24:32.630
in a deserted park.

24:32.664 --> 24:33.966
There was no reason

24:33.999 --> 24:35.502
for the defendant
to be there

24:35.536 --> 24:38.141
and the reason he gave
was clearly a lie.

24:38.175 --> 24:40.044
Imagine being there
that night.

24:40.079 --> 24:41.314
Imagine seeing him

24:41.347 --> 24:42.750
race to that trunk,

24:42.784 --> 24:44.019
slam it down,

24:44.052 --> 24:47.025
then refuse to answer
the most basic questions.

24:47.059 --> 24:48.328
The nervous voice,

24:48.361 --> 24:49.964
the lack of eye contact,

24:49.998 --> 24:52.336
the fact that he tried
to flee the scene,

24:52.369 --> 24:54.207
the defendant was acting

24:54.240 --> 24:55.442
like a criminal,

24:55.475 --> 24:56.778
someone in the process

24:56.812 --> 24:58.315
of committing a crime.

24:58.348 --> 25:00.793
Officer Hope
had probable cause

25:00.826 --> 25:02.363
to believe a crime
was occurring,

25:02.396 --> 25:05.169
and the evidence
was inside that trunk.

25:06.572 --> 25:07.907
He was right

25:09.277 --> 25:12.216
and that may not decide
the question,

25:12.249 --> 25:13.619
but it certainly tells you

25:13.652 --> 25:16.023
he was reading the signs.

25:16.424 --> 25:17.994
Ms. Dole wants to talk

25:18.027 --> 25:21.134
about offending justice.

25:21.534 --> 25:22.870
She's asking you

25:22.904 --> 25:24.841
to set a murderer free.

25:28.716 --> 25:30.185
Your husband testified

25:30.219 --> 25:31.622
that when he went
home the night

25:31.655 --> 25:33.525
of Katherine Vance's death,

25:33.558 --> 25:35.830
he wasn't bothered.

25:35.863 --> 25:36.898
Mrs. Barrett,

25:37.299 --> 25:39.938
did he seem unbothered to you?

25:39.971 --> 25:41.507
No.

25:41.541 --> 25:43.478
He came home that night

25:43.511 --> 25:45.249
and he seemed agitated.

25:45.282 --> 25:46.251
Agitated.

25:46.284 --> 25:46.985
MARGOT: Yes.

25:47.353 --> 25:48.722
And he had
just taken a shower

25:48.756 --> 25:49.924
before coming home,

25:49.958 --> 25:51.895
which I felt was very odd.

25:52.263 --> 25:54.233
GAMBLE: Did you ask him
what was wrong?

25:54.267 --> 25:54.934
MARGOT: Yes.

25:54.968 --> 25:57.139
He said nothing.

25:57.173 --> 25:59.210
But--
But what?

25:59.844 --> 26:01.053
From my perspective,

26:01.087 --> 26:03.826
it seemed something
traumatic had happened.

26:03.859 --> 26:05.129
GAMBLE: Mrs. Barrett,

26:05.162 --> 26:07.199
do you think
your husband killed--

26:07.233 --> 26:08.636
Objection.
FRUTT: Objection.

26:08.669 --> 26:09.570
WHITE: Sustained.

26:10.139 --> 26:11.341
I have nothing further.

26:14.781 --> 26:16.084
YOUNG: Did you call the police

26:16.117 --> 26:17.754
with any of your suspicions?

26:17.787 --> 26:18.889
No,

26:18.922 --> 26:20.459
he's my husband
and I was hoping to be--

26:20.492 --> 26:21.928
YOUNG:
Oh, he's your husband now.

26:22.997 --> 26:24.533
You said he took a shower.

26:24.567 --> 26:26.738
Is it your testimony
that he never showered

26:26.772 --> 26:28.341
at work before coming home?

26:28.375 --> 26:30.445
No, he sometimes--
YOUNG: Is it your testimony

26:30.479 --> 26:32.717
that he never came home
from work upset?

26:32.750 --> 26:34.653
No, but here, it was very--
YOUNG: Is it your testimony

26:34.688 --> 26:35.690
that--
Ask that the witness

26:35.723 --> 26:37.226
be allowed to respond.

26:37.259 --> 26:38.561
She answered my question.

26:39.263 --> 26:40.866
Can you describe for this court

26:40.900 --> 26:42.636
your marriage,
Mrs. Barrett?

26:44.140 --> 26:45.275
It's rocky.

26:45.309 --> 26:46.377
YOUNG: Rocky?

26:46.411 --> 26:48.047
You've talked about divorce,
haven't you?

26:48.081 --> 26:49.884
MARGOT: Yes.
YOUNG: Well, with a divorce,

26:49.918 --> 26:50.820
you could get half.

26:50.853 --> 26:52.323
If he should go to prison,

26:52.356 --> 26:53.726
you basically
could spend it all.

26:53.759 --> 26:54.994
Objection.
Is that what this is?

26:55.028 --> 26:56.664
You turn on your husband--
Objection!

26:56.698 --> 26:59.103
YOUNG:
This is cross-examination.

26:59.137 --> 27:00.345
I'll allow it.

27:00.780 --> 27:02.083
YOUNG: My colleague
Ellenor Frutt

27:02.116 --> 27:04.153
talked to you many times.

27:04.187 --> 27:05.389
Why didn't you ever mention

27:05.422 --> 27:06.257
that your husband seemed

27:06.291 --> 27:07.293
agitated that night?

27:07.326 --> 27:08.295
Because as I--
YOUNG: You hadn't thought

27:08.328 --> 27:09.463
of it yet?
Objection!

27:09.497 --> 27:10.766
WHITE: Mr. Young--
Where were you that night?

27:10.800 --> 27:12.169
Here we go.
YOUNG: Sorry,

27:12.203 --> 27:14.307
but when we interviewed you,

27:14.340 --> 27:16.745
you told us you had
no information,

27:16.778 --> 27:18.248
and here you sit today

27:18.281 --> 27:19.751
with information.

27:21.687 --> 27:22.957
I guess that can happen

27:22.990 --> 27:24.460
when a conviction
can give you access

27:24.493 --> 27:25.996
to over $2,000,000.

27:26.030 --> 27:26.865
GAMBLE: Objection!

27:26.898 --> 27:27.734
YOUNG: Withdrawn.

27:27.767 --> 27:29.237
Nothing further.

27:37.286 --> 27:39.590
I'm afraid I'm a little
confused, Jamie.

27:39.623 --> 27:41.627
Well, I just think

27:41.661 --> 27:43.331
since you were
the judge on my case

27:43.365 --> 27:45.269
and I did begin the case

27:45.302 --> 27:47.339
with some serious flirting,

27:47.373 --> 27:50.011
to avoid even the appearance

27:50.044 --> 27:51.347
of impropriety,

27:51.381 --> 27:53.085
we probably shouldn't be seen

27:53.118 --> 27:54.453
having a drink together.

27:54.620 --> 27:56.091
Are you saying

27:56.124 --> 27:57.359
you'd rather
get it privately?

27:57.393 --> 27:58.829
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

27:58.862 --> 28:01.574
I'm saying we probably
shouldn't get it at all.

28:01.607 --> 28:04.347
We shouldn't be social.

28:04.380 --> 28:05.850
Were you flirting with me

28:05.883 --> 28:07.519
because you were interested

28:07.553 --> 28:08.655
or you simply tried

28:08.688 --> 28:10.659
to influence my decision?
Well--

28:10.692 --> 28:11.795
BRENFORD:
Because it was the latter,

28:11.828 --> 28:14.901
even though
you didn't influence me,

28:14.934 --> 28:17.539
I should nevertheless
probably vacate my decision

28:17.573 --> 28:19.009
and remand the matter
to another judge to,

28:19.042 --> 28:21.747
like you say,
avoid even the appearance

28:21.782 --> 28:23.651
of impropriety.

28:23.685 --> 28:24.788
Should I do that?

28:25.422 --> 28:27.827
Now, it feels like
you're threatening me

28:27.860 --> 28:29.798
to undo your ruling,

28:29.831 --> 28:30.833
in which case,
my client--

28:30.866 --> 28:32.303
BRENFORD:
I'm merely following up

28:32.336 --> 28:34.808
on your implied allegation.

28:34.841 --> 28:38.081
If you think
there's any impropriety,

28:38.115 --> 28:39.984
it would be my duty
to vacate

28:40.018 --> 28:42.022
and hand the matter
to another judge.

28:43.926 --> 28:45.996
I don't feel
there's any impropriety.

28:46.998 --> 28:48.168
You sure?

28:48.802 --> 28:50.505
Yes.

28:50.539 --> 28:52.376
I'm very sure.

28:52.643 --> 28:54.547
Because if a lawyer

28:54.580 --> 28:56.784
before me even questions

28:56.818 --> 28:58.588
whether I'd stepped
over the line...

28:59.056 --> 29:00.499
I'm not questioning.

29:02.469 --> 29:03.405
(chuckles)

29:03.438 --> 29:04.440
Okay.

29:04.473 --> 29:05.775
Then I can't see any problem

29:05.810 --> 29:07.513
with us having
a drink together.

29:07.546 --> 29:09.683
I would tell you
if I thought so.

29:09.717 --> 29:11.421
(music playing)

29:15.662 --> 29:16.898
STANLEY: Lindsay!
What happened?

29:16.932 --> 29:18.068
He just wigged out,
but we called the paramedics.

29:18.101 --> 29:19.503
STANLEY:
Lindsay! Lindsay!

29:19.537 --> 29:21.174
Lindsay!

29:21.207 --> 29:22.143
DOLE: Stanley,
I'm right here!

29:22.176 --> 29:23.411
I'm right here!

29:23.445 --> 29:24.447
I wanna plead!

29:24.480 --> 29:25.715
I can't take the chance!

29:25.749 --> 29:27.253
I want to plead!

29:27.286 --> 29:29.590
DOLE: Stanley,
you need to calm down.

29:30.625 --> 29:32.829
I want to plead.

29:33.531 --> 29:35.369
If they let go of you,

29:35.402 --> 29:36.471
can you stay calm?

29:36.872 --> 29:37.639
Yes.

29:39.277 --> 29:40.179
Go ahead.

29:40.212 --> 29:43.085
(panting)

29:43.118 --> 29:44.087
You okay?

29:44.520 --> 29:46.157
I need to talk
to you alone.

29:48.161 --> 29:49.263
Handcuff him

29:49.297 --> 29:51.167
and cuff his leg
to the table.

29:51.201 --> 29:52.603
No.
Then I don't stay

29:52.636 --> 29:53.671
in this room alone with you.

29:53.705 --> 29:55.109
Simple as that.

29:56.277 --> 29:57.012
Okay.

29:58.581 --> 29:59.317
OFFICER: Stand up.

30:12.683 --> 30:13.919
We'll watch
through the glass.

30:14.153 --> 30:15.355
Thank you.

30:21.834 --> 30:23.438
The reason
that I was so desperate

30:23.471 --> 30:25.442
to have you as my attorney,

30:25.910 --> 30:27.646
you're in a unique position

30:27.679 --> 30:28.848
to bargain for me.

30:29.183 --> 30:31.487
Why?
STANLEY: Your old firm,

30:31.521 --> 30:33.425
it's on another case that...

30:35.695 --> 30:38.735
I can help the police with.

30:38.768 --> 30:40.472
The police solved
that one, Stanley.

30:40.505 --> 30:42.209
I don't--
STANLEY: No, they didn't.

30:42.876 --> 30:45.014
I killed that woman.

30:48.455 --> 30:50.159
I beg your pardon?

30:50.525 --> 30:51.661
Kathy Vance.

30:54.667 --> 30:56.036
I stabbed her,

30:56.071 --> 30:58.908
threw her in the woods.

30:58.942 --> 31:01.988
I am willing to confess

31:02.022 --> 31:04.293
to that crime
and this one here

31:04.327 --> 31:07.433
if they agree

31:07.466 --> 31:09.137
to put me in a hospital

31:09.170 --> 31:10.605
instead of prison.

31:12.076 --> 31:12.876
(sighs)

31:14.780 --> 31:17.553
You killed Kathy Vance?

31:18.989 --> 31:20.092
Yes.

31:20.125 --> 31:21.761
And that's why you wanted me,

31:21.794 --> 31:23.531
because of my old firm?

31:23.565 --> 31:24.667
STANLEY: And I know
you're friends

31:24.700 --> 31:26.137
with the D. A.,
Helen Gamble.

31:26.171 --> 31:28.675
You can make it happen.

31:28.708 --> 31:30.145
(knocks on door)

31:30.179 --> 31:31.681
The judge is back.

31:32.083 --> 31:33.017
(door closes)

31:33.050 --> 31:34.187
Oh, my God.

31:34.887 --> 31:35.855
Look,

31:36.857 --> 31:39.563
what you have
to give them,

31:39.597 --> 31:41.301
you'll still have it
after this ruling.

31:42.336 --> 31:44.240
You might as well take
your chances with Hiller.

31:45.742 --> 31:46.844
The search was bad.

31:51.687 --> 31:53.258
Let's just see
what she says.

31:57.099 --> 31:58.268
WOMAN: Be seated.

32:05.422 --> 32:08.195
I have spent
the past three hours

32:08.228 --> 32:09.730
trying to conceive of a way

32:09.763 --> 32:11.434
that I can uphold the search

32:11.467 --> 32:13.138
of the defendant's trunk

32:13.171 --> 32:15.008
and the ensuing confession.

32:16.611 --> 32:18.248
I failed.

32:19.016 --> 32:21.587
This wasn't made incident to
an arrest.

32:21.621 --> 32:23.558
It had nothing
to do with trying

32:23.591 --> 32:25.028
to stop the suspect

32:25.062 --> 32:26.464
from obtaining a weapon.

32:26.497 --> 32:29.103
We've got nothing
plain sight.

32:29.137 --> 32:31.040
This was warrantless

32:31.074 --> 32:33.911
and, simply put,
unconstitutional.

32:34.647 --> 32:36.351
It sickens me

32:36.384 --> 32:37.586
to squash it

32:38.054 --> 32:39.890
because the result--

32:43.030 --> 32:46.271
this officer needs to be sent
immediately back

32:46.304 --> 32:47.406
to the academy.

32:48.975 --> 32:50.679
The search and confession

32:50.712 --> 32:51.981
are hereby suppressed.

32:52.014 --> 32:53.818
The charges are dismissed,

32:53.851 --> 32:55.020
and the defendant,

32:55.054 --> 32:57.626
I'm horrified to say,

32:57.659 --> 32:58.861
is free to go.

33:01.274 --> 33:02.443
We are adjourned.

33:02.476 --> 33:03.145
(gavel bangs)

33:03.178 --> 33:04.680
(indistinct chatter)

33:11.194 --> 33:12.329
What happened?

33:12.529 --> 33:13.765
You're free.

33:13.798 --> 33:15.802
She threw out the search
and the confession.

33:16.002 --> 33:18.408
I can just walk out?
DOLE: Yes,

33:18.441 --> 33:20.212
but you still
wanna help the police

33:20.245 --> 33:21.447
on that other matter

33:21.481 --> 33:22.416
and get some help.

33:22.449 --> 33:24.153
There's no need to now, right?

33:27.493 --> 33:28.628
I'm free.

33:32.969 --> 33:33.871
Right.

33:35.074 --> 33:36.377
Thank you, Lindsay.

33:38.648 --> 33:39.917
Thank you.

33:39.950 --> 33:42.123
(music playing)

33:59.490 --> 34:02.156
(car engine revving)

34:02.189 --> 34:03.727
BERLUTI: What do you mean
you couldn't get out of it?

34:03.760 --> 34:04.895
He kind of tricked me.

34:04.929 --> 34:05.964
Tricked you how?

34:05.997 --> 34:07.099
He sort of implied

34:07.133 --> 34:08.400
that he would
undo his ruling,

34:08.435 --> 34:09.972
though he was careful
the way he said it

34:10.005 --> 34:13.045
and he basically
had me insisting

34:13.078 --> 34:14.080
there was no impropriety,

34:14.112 --> 34:15.751
and, look,
the guy's a judge,

34:15.784 --> 34:16.819
he's smarter than me.

34:16.853 --> 34:18.554
Jamie--
STRINGER: Don't worry.

34:18.588 --> 34:19.590
I know how to dump guys

34:19.623 --> 34:20.927
and flatter them
at the same time.

34:20.960 --> 34:22.362
I'll have one drink
and I'll wiggle out

34:22.396 --> 34:25.034
of the situation.
BERLUTI: This isn't a frat boy.

34:25.069 --> 34:25.971
He's a judge.

34:26.004 --> 34:27.273
I can handle him.

34:27.306 --> 34:29.010
I can.
BERLUTI: Is he threatening you

34:29.043 --> 34:30.679
in any way?
No.

34:30.713 --> 34:33.752
BERLUTI: Jamie, you're walking
down a path here.

34:33.786 --> 34:35.991
This is your career

34:36.024 --> 34:37.126
and it's you.

34:39.063 --> 34:40.264
I can handle it.

34:44.206 --> 34:45.777
He was the last person

34:45.811 --> 34:48.081
to see her alive.

34:48.114 --> 34:49.751
Her body was found

34:49.784 --> 34:52.089
behind his office building

34:53.091 --> 34:54.895
with his semen
inside of her.

34:55.529 --> 34:58.035
They were recently
seen fighting.

34:58.068 --> 34:59.637
She had slapped him.

35:01.314 --> 35:04.087
The defendant's own wife
knew something

35:04.120 --> 35:05.389
was wrong that night.

35:05.422 --> 35:08.061
He came home agitated

35:08.095 --> 35:10.499
and then we learn

35:10.532 --> 35:12.036
he's a drug addict.

35:12.938 --> 35:15.342
Maybe Katherine Vance
was going to expose him,

35:16.344 --> 35:18.481
ruin his marriage,

35:18.515 --> 35:20.152
ruin his career,

35:21.421 --> 35:22.891
we don't know.

35:22.925 --> 35:25.595
We can't.

35:25.629 --> 35:27.968
Katherine Vance is dead.

35:28.535 --> 35:30.405
We do know

35:30.439 --> 35:33.245
the defendant took the stand

35:33.278 --> 35:35.182
and lied,

35:35.215 --> 35:37.019
all the defense has offered

35:37.053 --> 35:39.992
is the defendant's word.

35:40.025 --> 35:42.029
And he takes the stand

35:43.098 --> 35:44.835
and lies.

35:44.869 --> 35:48.475
YOUNG: Dr. Barrett was afraid
to admit his addiction

35:48.508 --> 35:49.243
because he knew

35:49.277 --> 35:51.447
it would hurt his career,

35:51.481 --> 35:53.485
but there's no evidence
it caused him

35:53.518 --> 35:54.989
to kill Kathy Vance.

35:55.022 --> 35:57.526
There's no evidence
she even made any threats

35:57.559 --> 35:59.397
to go public.

35:59.430 --> 36:02.209
My client did
everything he could

36:02.243 --> 36:03.545
to help the police.

36:03.746 --> 36:06.317
He called them to say
the victim was missing.

36:06.351 --> 36:08.890
He gave them permission
to search everything.

36:08.923 --> 36:12.296
He even provided
a blood sample.

36:12.329 --> 36:15.803
Someone else could have
killed Kathy Vance,

36:15.836 --> 36:18.175
someone outside
who saw her leave.

36:18.208 --> 36:19.477
All their evidence,

36:19.510 --> 36:20.813
her being there that night,

36:20.846 --> 36:21.983
the semen,

36:22.016 --> 36:23.485
it proves the affair.

36:23.752 --> 36:25.891
It doesn't prove murder.

36:26.858 --> 36:28.561
And as for the wife

36:28.595 --> 36:31.167
suddenly coming forward
saying things

36:31.201 --> 36:32.737
didn't seem right,

36:33.038 --> 36:35.109
she had a motive to lie.

36:35.142 --> 36:37.279
She had 2,000,000 reasons.

36:38.749 --> 36:39.985
She never told the police

36:40.019 --> 36:41.487
or defense counsel

36:41.521 --> 36:43.291
that Dr. Barrett
seemed agitated.

36:43.325 --> 36:45.229
She manufactured that later

36:45.262 --> 36:47.133
when she tumbled to the idea

36:47.166 --> 36:48.501
that she could profit

36:48.535 --> 36:50.272
by putting him in prison.

36:50.806 --> 36:52.476
She got even.

36:52.509 --> 36:54.647
For all we know,

36:54.681 --> 36:56.885
maybe she was hiding
in the bushes that night

36:56.919 --> 36:58.388
waiting for Katherine Vance

36:58.421 --> 36:59.423
to come out.

37:02.870 --> 37:03.872
We don't know.

37:06.477 --> 37:07.546
(door opens)

37:07.579 --> 37:09.350
HILLER:
It's not often the winner

37:09.383 --> 37:10.786
comes in to complain.

37:10.819 --> 37:12.556
I'm not complaining

37:12.589 --> 37:15.997
and this is about a completely
unrelated matter.

37:16.030 --> 37:18.534
It's just...

37:18.568 --> 37:20.505
I respect you
more than anyone

37:20.539 --> 37:21.708
on interpreting the law

37:21.742 --> 37:25.482
and, uh,
I have a client

37:25.515 --> 37:27.419
who committed a crime
somebody else stands

37:27.453 --> 37:29.223
to be convicted for.

37:29.257 --> 37:30.860
And?

37:30.893 --> 37:33.832
And do I have any recourse

37:33.866 --> 37:35.635
to cure the injustice?

37:35.669 --> 37:37.006
I'm sure the answer's no,

37:37.039 --> 37:38.075
but...

37:38.108 --> 37:40.079
Then why ask the question?

37:41.481 --> 37:42.717
Is the answer yes?

37:42.750 --> 37:44.353
In 49 other states,

37:44.387 --> 37:45.522
your hands are tied.

37:45.555 --> 37:46.692
In Massachusetts,

37:46.725 --> 37:48.495
there is a provision

37:48.528 --> 37:50.565
in rule 1.6.

37:50.599 --> 37:53.471
It allows an attorney

37:53.505 --> 37:54.473
to break the privilege

37:54.507 --> 37:56.011
to keep an innocent man

37:56.044 --> 37:57.513
from going to prison.

37:57.546 --> 37:58.548
Do you have a case?

37:58.581 --> 38:00.793
HILLER: No,
because there aren't any.

38:00.826 --> 38:02.063
There's never been
a decision

38:02.096 --> 38:05.569
because no attorney has ever
invoked the provision.

38:05.803 --> 38:06.738
Why not?

38:06.772 --> 38:08.541
HILLER: You know
the answer to that.

38:08.575 --> 38:10.312
Privilege
is the bedrock principle

38:10.345 --> 38:11.915
of criminal justice.

38:11.948 --> 38:13.618
There may be
an exception on paper,

38:13.651 --> 38:16.124
but no defense
attorney's ever been

38:16.157 --> 38:19.230
willing to use it,
rightfully so.

38:19.263 --> 38:20.933
But I can.

38:20.966 --> 38:22.369
I have the discretion.

38:22.403 --> 38:23.806
HILLER: That's right.

38:23.839 --> 38:25.442
But Lindsay,
you'd be signing

38:25.475 --> 38:27.980
your own career
death warrant.

38:28.015 --> 38:29.550
You'll be news,
a pariah

38:29.583 --> 38:31.521
with every other attorney,

38:31.554 --> 38:34.027
not just criminal.

38:34.060 --> 38:35.763
What type of crime

38:35.796 --> 38:36.965
do you have knowledge of?

38:36.999 --> 38:38.668
It's a murder.

38:38.702 --> 38:39.370
HILLER: Ah.

38:40.305 --> 38:42.209
Why am I not surprised?

38:43.478 --> 38:45.015
The reason this provision

38:45.049 --> 38:46.617
has never been invoked,

38:46.651 --> 38:47.787
most lawyers,

38:47.820 --> 38:49.590
most judges,
including me,

38:49.623 --> 38:51.361
think it's wrong.

38:51.394 --> 38:54.167
A client's trust
is a client's trust.

38:54.200 --> 38:55.803
A lawyer doesn't break it.

38:55.836 --> 38:58.141
It isn't always that easy.

38:58.175 --> 39:00.045
HILLER:
You think it was easy

39:00.079 --> 39:02.022
for me to kick Stanley Deeks?

39:03.025 --> 39:05.362
You came to me for advice.

39:05.395 --> 39:06.397
Technically,

39:06.431 --> 39:09.237
you can reveal
what you know.

39:09.270 --> 39:10.372
Ethically,

39:10.405 --> 39:12.476
I say you don't.

39:16.351 --> 39:17.119
BRENFORD:
I don't know about you,

39:17.153 --> 39:18.321
but I'm pretty hungry.

39:18.355 --> 39:19.691
It's only 5:00.

39:19.724 --> 39:21.627
I know,
but let's head over

39:21.661 --> 39:22.830
to Jasper's and get a bite.

39:22.864 --> 39:24.300
It's not too far.

39:24.333 --> 39:26.237
Okay.
Nice thing about being a judge

39:26.271 --> 39:27.573
is the ability to say,

39:27.606 --> 39:29.177
"Day's over, folks."

39:29.210 --> 39:30.345
Sometimes think
about going back

39:30.379 --> 39:32.917
into private practice
and then I think

39:32.950 --> 39:35.489
I'd miss
the control too much.

39:35.522 --> 39:37.659
Door's open.

39:37.694 --> 39:39.097
Of course,
what I'd really like

39:39.130 --> 39:40.365
is to captain a boat.

39:40.399 --> 39:41.968
That's the control
I'm looking for.

39:42.403 --> 39:44.073
Be out in the open sea,

39:44.107 --> 39:45.675
sail to Nantucket.

39:46.712 --> 39:47.579
What's wrong?

39:49.350 --> 39:50.485
Jamie?

39:54.327 --> 39:56.131
I can't get a drink
with you.

39:56.765 --> 39:58.168
I'm sorry,
but having appeared

39:58.201 --> 40:00.172
before you on a case,

40:00.205 --> 40:01.547
I think it's wrong.

40:03.952 --> 40:05.856
If you feel the need
to vacate your decision,

40:05.890 --> 40:07.259
that's your call.

40:07.293 --> 40:09.163
My call,

40:09.197 --> 40:10.565
I'm not getting this drink.

40:13.739 --> 40:14.841
Good night, Your Honor.

40:16.144 --> 40:19.183
(music playing)

40:37.219 --> 40:39.123
WHITE: Will the defendant
please rise?

40:40.960 --> 40:43.966
Mr. Foreman, has the jury
reached a unanimous verdict?

40:44.267 --> 40:45.369
We have, Your Honor.

40:45.402 --> 40:46.972
WHITE: What say you?

40:47.005 --> 40:50.011
FOREMAN: Commonwealth
versus Steven Barrett.

40:50.880 --> 40:52.082
On the charge of murder

40:52.115 --> 40:53.084
in the first degree,

40:53.117 --> 40:54.387
we find the defendant,

40:54.420 --> 40:56.291
Steven Barrett,

40:57.393 --> 40:58.228
guilty.

40:58.261 --> 41:00.599
(indistinct chatter)

41:03.345 --> 41:04.280
The defense moves

41:04.313 --> 41:05.549
to set aside the verdict.

41:05.582 --> 41:06.617
Denied.

41:06.651 --> 41:08.956
Security, take charge
of the defendant.

41:09.357 --> 41:10.592
Members of the jury,

41:10.625 --> 41:12.563
you're dismissed
with the thanks of this court.

41:13.565 --> 41:15.169
This matter
is now adjourned.

41:15.202 --> 41:16.136
(gavel bangs)

41:17.138 --> 41:18.475
We're gonna review the record

41:18.508 --> 41:20.011
and find grounds to appeal.

41:21.013 --> 41:21.848
Okay.

41:23.585 --> 41:26.156
(indistinct chatter)

41:32.804 --> 41:34.240
You can go.
I'll handle this.

41:34.774 --> 41:37.112
Are you sure?
YOUNG: Yeah, go ahead.

41:37.145 --> 41:39.650
(indistinct chatter)

41:42.757 --> 41:43.625
Lindsay.

41:43.759 --> 41:44.728
Hey.

41:44.761 --> 41:47.599
I came to bring you luck.

41:47.633 --> 41:50.305
I'm sorry.
Yeah.

41:50.339 --> 41:52.343
MAN: Excuse me, Ms. Frutt.
FRUTT: Uh, Eugene Young

41:52.376 --> 41:53.245
will be fielding
all your questions.

41:53.278 --> 41:54.247
I've got no comment.

41:54.280 --> 41:55.114
I'm sorry.

41:57.954 --> 42:00.933
(indistinct chatter)

42:09.718 --> 42:11.922
It's not like I thought
we would win,

42:11.955 --> 42:13.190
but...

42:13.692 --> 42:15.161
But what?

42:15.495 --> 42:17.666
I don't know.

42:17.700 --> 42:20.539
Something just tells me

42:20.572 --> 42:23.210
this one was innocent.

42:23.245 --> 42:26.251
(music playing)

42:30.993 --> 42:32.629
Any grounds for appeal?

42:34.667 --> 42:36.271
I don't know.

42:39.176 --> 42:40.178
(sighs)

42:40.211 --> 42:43.217
(music playing)

42:59.517 --> 43:02.529
(music playing)

43:25.876 --> 43:27.045
WOMAN: You stinker.

43:29.049 --> 43:30.051
(music playing)
