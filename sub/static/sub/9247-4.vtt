WEBVTT

00:03.960 --> 00:05.657
I wonder why in all
these scary movies

00:05.744 --> 00:09.879
you never see
one fat vampire?

00:09.966 --> 00:11.359
That's easy,
they drink nothing but blood

00:11.446 --> 00:14.014
and that's pure protein.

00:14.101 --> 00:16.886
Oh, yeah,
there's no carbs.

00:16.973 --> 00:18.453
Exactly, if I could
stand the taste of it

00:18.540 --> 00:20.846
I'd fill up my
sports bottle.

00:20.933 --> 00:24.241
It's not just vampires.
There are no chubby monsters.

00:24.328 --> 00:28.332
Not true.
Godzilla kind of had a gut.

00:28.419 --> 00:30.378
Nah, he just lived in
Tokyo, so he ate nothing

00:30.465 --> 00:33.685
but people filled with
white rice and MSG.

00:33.772 --> 00:34.730
[chuckles]

00:37.733 --> 00:41.215
You're smart.

00:41.302 --> 00:45.828
I love our little talks.
What is it?

00:45.915 --> 00:47.264
Food in the tooth
or bat in the cave?

00:47.351 --> 00:50.093
No, no, no, you're fine.

00:50.180 --> 00:52.139
I was actually just
thinking how fun it would be

00:52.226 --> 00:53.662
to have our own little..

00:53.749 --> 00:55.533
...monster sitting
here between us.

00:55.620 --> 00:58.536
I thought your mom
hated scary movies.

00:58.623 --> 01:01.104
I'm talking about
a baby, you know?

01:01.191 --> 01:04.064
Bringing a little me
and you into the world.

01:04.151 --> 01:07.893
And you really imagine it
being little, huh?

01:07.980 --> 01:09.852
As long as it doesn't have
that big pumpkin head of yours.

01:09.939 --> 01:14.204
If I see Charlie Brown on the
sonogram, he's staying in there.

01:14.291 --> 01:15.858
Alright, you talked me into it.

01:15.945 --> 01:18.034
- Let's knock you up.
- Wait, wait. Wait, wait.

01:18.121 --> 01:21.559
We, we need to discuss the
logistics of this first.

01:21.646 --> 01:22.995
Hey, I know how
to make a baby.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.519
We just do it the way
we've been doing it

01:24.606 --> 01:26.738
but no slicker on the vicar.

01:29.263 --> 01:31.047
Mike, we..

01:31.134 --> 01:33.702
We have no money, we live in
a house with three other people

01:33.789 --> 01:38.620
and you're still calling
your penis the vicar.

01:38.707 --> 01:41.710
I won't say it
around the kid.

01:41.797 --> 01:43.581
The point is we both
want a family

01:43.668 --> 01:46.149
and all that other stuff
will work itself out.

01:46.236 --> 01:48.325
We're talking about
another human being.

01:48.412 --> 01:51.372
I mean...well, a life
that we're responsible for

01:51.459 --> 01:52.938
for at least 18 years.

01:53.025 --> 01:55.202
At least 18? Look at you.
Still live with your mother.

01:55.289 --> 01:56.551
We sleep in your childhood bed.

01:56.638 --> 01:59.249
Wha..

01:59.336 --> 02:02.252
Hey, that's my big-girl bed,
and I bought it myself.

02:02.339 --> 02:03.993
Granted, mom loaned me the money

02:04.080 --> 02:07.518
but I think she forgot it,
so, technically, it's mine.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.870
Guess, when you weigh
the pros and cons

02:11.957 --> 02:12.871
maybe it doesn't
make sense for us

02:12.958 --> 02:15.483
to have a kid right now.

02:15.570 --> 02:17.572
Yeah, I, I agree.

02:17.659 --> 02:19.139
You know, smart thing is..

02:19.226 --> 02:20.966
...is to wait.

02:22.838 --> 02:27.234
Although, if our folks would've
waited for the perfect time.

02:27.321 --> 02:29.453
you and I probably
wouldn't be here.

02:29.540 --> 02:31.847
The way my mom tells it,
I owe my existence

02:31.934 --> 02:34.110
to a tight tube top
and a loose condom.

02:36.373 --> 02:38.941
I was makeup sex after
an ugly New Year's Eve party.

02:40.812 --> 02:43.032
Guessing the sex
wasn't pretty either.

02:45.687 --> 02:47.950
What are you thinking?

02:48.037 --> 02:53.303
Well, this movie stinks, we got
the whole house to ourselves

02:53.390 --> 02:56.088
we've been talking about sex
for the last five minutes.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.178
You're the smart one.
What do you think I'm thinkin'?

03:00.354 --> 03:02.312

isn't exactly setting

03:35.389 --> 03:37.129
off my smoke alarm.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.435
Just a little nervous.

03:38.522 --> 03:39.741
This is first time
we're going to have sex

03:39.828 --> 03:41.351

Let's put a toddler
in your tank.

03:51.405 --> 03:53.842
Yeah, sweetie, I really
appreciate your enthusiasm

03:53.929 --> 03:56.453
but, you know, it probably
won't happen the first time.

03:56.540 --> 03:58.150
Don't underestimate my sperm.

03:58.238 --> 04:02.590
They're like red ants
on a wet Smartie.

I can't believe
I'm gonna say this, but..

04:14.384 --> 04:16.517
Almost everything good
that's ever happened to me

04:16.604 --> 04:17.866
I was wearing that hat

04:17.953 --> 04:20.216

I laid eyes on you.

04:21.826 --> 04:25.265
Get the hat.
What the hell?

04:25.352 --> 04:27.789
Maybe I'll put on
my lucky lotto bra.

04:31.836 --> 04:34.012
[instrumental music]

04:35.057 --> 04:36.537
I am telling you, Carl

04:36.624 --> 04:40.454
reproductive sex is
the best kind of sex.

04:40.541 --> 04:42.673
It's got all the fun
of regular sex

04:42.760 --> 04:44.501
but with a prize at the end.

04:46.329 --> 04:47.896
It's like Cracker Jacks.

Can we talk about
something other

04:51.334 --> 04:53.380
than the fact
that you got laid?

04:53.467 --> 04:54.685
I didn't just get laid.

04:54.772 --> 04:57.122
I was making love
to my soul mate

04:57.209 --> 04:59.777
participating in the creation
of another human life.

04:59.864 --> 05:02.693
What did you do last night?

05:02.780 --> 05:04.216
I watched porn
and had sex with myself.

05:04.304 --> 05:07.307
Ah!

05:07.394 --> 05:10.266
- Which was also beautiful.
- Ah!

05:10.353 --> 05:12.007
You know what,
breakfast is on me.

05:12.094 --> 05:14.488
Oh, wonderful,
and will my insulting tip be in

05:14.575 --> 05:19.144
nickels and pennies or in
lint-covered Life Savers?

05:19.231 --> 05:20.972
Why don't you celebrate
President's Day

05:21.059 --> 05:23.584
with Mr. Lincoln
and Mr. Washington.

05:23.671 --> 05:26.021
Mm-hmm.

05:26.108 --> 05:28.458
They're real.

05:28.545 --> 05:30.634
Yeah, well,
you understand my suspicions.

05:30.721 --> 05:32.288
You've never given me a
Washington and a Lincoln

05:32.375 --> 05:34.943
in paper form.

05:35.030 --> 05:37.380
I'm in a good mood. Molly and I
are trying to get pregnant.

05:37.467 --> 05:39.513
Oh, congratulations.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.428
I guess
you'll be eating for two now.

If my sperm
are anything like me

are anything like you

Boy, you're in a mood.

06:10.892 --> 06:12.807
Hey, I just broke up
with my girlfriend.

06:12.894 --> 06:15.375
I don't want to hear
how happy and in love you are.

06:15.462 --> 06:18.073
I understand
and I apologize.

In my excitement, I forgot
you'd recently been crapped on.

06:21.772 --> 06:22.860
Just dial it back.

06:22.947 --> 06:23.905
If you're gonna be
a father someday

06:23.992 --> 06:25.123
you got to recognize the needs

06:25.210 --> 06:26.995
of a vulnerable
and fragile creature.

06:27.082 --> 06:29.301
Just, just think of me
as an emotional newborn.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.868
I usually do.
I'm sorry.

06:34.916 --> 06:35.873

06:35.960 --> 06:37.658
Okay, okay, okay

06:37.745 --> 06:39.442
we are technically
trying to get pregnant

06:39.529 --> 06:41.183
but, you know,
we're just not tellin' everybody

06:41.270 --> 06:42.750
and makin'
a big deal out of it.

06:42.837 --> 06:45.187
That's best. Once you raise
people's expectations

06:45.274 --> 06:47.102
it puts too much pressure
on the relationship.

06:47.189 --> 06:50.061
Exactly, and it takes all
the fun out of making the baby.

06:50.148 --> 06:52.760
And you better have fun now
because once you have kids

06:52.847 --> 06:53.804
your life is gonna change.

06:53.891 --> 06:55.545
Tell me about it.

Your dad and I had a ball
before you girls were born.

our lives ended.

07:03.379 --> 07:06.338
Just the good parts.

07:06.426 --> 07:10.038
But having children brought
you a lot of joy, right?

07:10.125 --> 07:13.563
Eh, a couple laughs
here and there

07:13.650 --> 07:16.653

a toddler, hmm?

07:20.483 --> 07:23.312
Dumb as rocks.

07:23.399 --> 07:25.880
You'd chase a firefly
in front of a bus

07:25.967 --> 07:27.534

to put a cone on you.

there are a lot of rewards too.

Ooh, a quickie!

08:27.158 --> 08:30.074
After you have kids,
all you get are quickies.

08:30.161 --> 08:31.815
Foreplay is putting out
your cigarette

08:31.902 --> 08:33.948
and moving your underwear
off to the side.

08:39.127 --> 08:41.129
What the hell
is she doing here?

08:41.216 --> 08:44.567

and it's her house.

08:44.654 --> 08:46.134
Not her. Christina.

- I invited her.
- Well, she's the enemy now.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.833
Get her out of here,
and use the back door

08:49.920 --> 08:50.921
in case Carl drives by.

08:51.008 --> 08:52.444
No.

and she's my friend.

but she dumped my partner.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.189

so she's dead to us.

restaurant

08:59.626 --> 09:00.975

for garlic bread.

hanging out with Christina

before the big game.

It's about me.

to himself.

like head lice.

After you give Christina
the heave-ho

you and I could have baby sex.

09:22.170 --> 09:24.172
Well, I-I'm sorry
to disappoint you

09:24.259 --> 09:27.001
but I'm not giving
Christina the heave-ho.

on the baby sex?

09:30.700 --> 09:33.007
I didn't say that

thinkin' about for names?

Vince, it's a little early
to start picking out baby names.

09:52.417 --> 09:54.637
Not for the baby, for me.

09:54.724 --> 09:58.032
I don't like poppy,
pop-pop or pee-paw.

09:58.119 --> 10:00.382
None of the Ps.

10:00.469 --> 10:03.428
Okay, so poop face, peckerhead,
and pain in the ass are out?

10:04.952 --> 10:06.910
Yes.

10:06.997 --> 10:11.132
I'd prefer granddaddy, gramps
or Grand Master Grampy.

10:11.219 --> 10:13.221
Alright, well, if I ever let
you anywhere near my child

10:13.308 --> 10:14.831
I'll give him a list.

Knock, knock.
Hey, is Mike ready to go?

10:17.442 --> 10:18.661
Hey, he's running
a little late this morning.

10:18.748 --> 10:19.836
I'll let him know
you're here.

10:19.923 --> 10:21.577
She's burning his candle
at both ends

10:21.664 --> 10:22.796
and by candle, I mean--

10:22.883 --> 10:25.712
Shut up, poop pop!

10:25.799 --> 10:27.278
Mike, Carl's here!

10:27.365 --> 10:29.846
[Mike]
'Down in a minute!'

10:29.933 --> 10:33.154
- Hmm. Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

10:33.241 --> 10:35.199
Um, I know you and Christina
are on the outs

10:35.286 --> 10:37.375
but you're okay
with me and her

10:37.462 --> 10:39.290
you know, staying friends,
right?

10:39.377 --> 10:41.684
- Of course, why wouldn't I be?
- That's what I told Mike.

10:41.771 --> 10:44.426
He said that he thinks
you expect me to choose sides.

10:44.513 --> 10:47.211
He said that about me?

10:47.298 --> 10:49.910
He really does not know people.

10:49.997 --> 10:51.520
So, you're okay with us
being friends?

10:51.607 --> 10:53.130
Yeah, I mean, just because
it didn't work out

10:53.217 --> 10:54.566
between the two of us,
doesn't mean I don't want

10:54.654 --> 10:55.742
it to work out
between the two of you.

10:55.829 --> 10:57.526
- I knew you'd say that.
- 'Yeah.'

10:57.613 --> 10:59.528
It's very evolved of you.

10:59.615 --> 11:01.486
I believe in taking
the high road.

11:01.573 --> 11:03.924
A lot less traffic.

11:04.011 --> 11:05.403
Let's roll.

11:05.490 --> 11:06.404
- Bye, Molly.
- Bye.

11:12.628 --> 11:14.804
You know the great thing
about trying to make a baby?

11:14.891 --> 11:17.372
You sleep like a baby!

11:17.459 --> 11:18.895
I don't know
how you sleep at all.

11:18.982 --> 11:23.030
You duplicitous,
lying backstabber.

11:23.117 --> 11:25.293
Sounds like somebody
missed breakfast.

11:40.482 --> 11:42.136
Come on, Carl,
I'm just as upset

11:42.223 --> 11:43.964
about this whole thing
as you are.

11:44.051 --> 11:46.096
- Oh, really?
- Absolutely.

11:46.183 --> 11:48.011
When I walked in the house
and saw Christina there

11:48.098 --> 11:50.231
I felt just as betrayed
as you did.

11:50.318 --> 11:54.409
Hang on a second.
She's been inside your home?

11:54.496 --> 11:56.628
Technically,
i-it's not my home.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.805
It's Molly's,
and I have no pull there.

11:58.892 --> 12:00.632
I'm basically
just an outside dog

12:00.720 --> 12:02.939
that gets to sleep
on the bed.

12:03.026 --> 12:04.419
Hey, it's your life, man.

12:04.506 --> 12:06.160
If you wanna be
friends with Christina

12:06.247 --> 12:07.465
it's none of my business.

12:07.552 --> 12:09.424
I don't want to be friends
with Christina.

12:09.511 --> 12:10.773
In fact, I was just being
nice to her

12:10.860 --> 12:12.557
because she was dating you.

12:12.644 --> 12:16.474
Oh, so your two-faced nature
is not exclusive to just me.

12:16.561 --> 12:19.477
Alright, clearly you're not
in the mood to listen.

12:19.564 --> 12:21.697
I'm not talking to you
for the rest of the day.

12:21.784 --> 12:23.133
- You hungry?
- Yes.

12:23.220 --> 12:24.961
You talked to me.

12:25.048 --> 12:26.093
Shut up and drive.

12:26.180 --> 12:27.834
- You talked again.
- Aah!

12:29.705 --> 12:31.838
I'm just sayin', be careful.

12:31.925 --> 12:34.231
You think your kids
are gonna fly the coop at 18

12:34.318 --> 12:35.842
but they never do.

12:37.757 --> 12:41.064
This point,
I'd settle for 40.

12:41.151 --> 12:43.675
Alright, I get it, mom.
I ruined your life.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.026
Whoa!
Where did that come from?

12:49.159 --> 12:50.508
Oh, hey, honey.
How was your day?

12:50.595 --> 12:52.032
Let me explain
something to you.

12:52.119 --> 12:54.599
The relationship between
two cops is built on trust

12:54.686 --> 12:57.515
and when that trust is broken,
bad things happen.

12:57.602 --> 13:00.431
- What are you talkin' about?
- I got tagged.

13:02.172 --> 13:05.915
- Are you happy now?
- Wait.

13:06.002 --> 13:08.526
Wow, now he looks even more
like an abandoned building.

13:10.311 --> 13:11.921
Wait. What happened?

13:12.008 --> 13:13.836
I was trying to apprehend
some kid with a spray can

13:13.923 --> 13:18.536
and another kid snuck up
behind me and did this.

13:18.623 --> 13:20.060
How long did it take
you to realize it?

13:20.147 --> 13:22.976
'Cause there's a lot of
detail work in this.

13:23.063 --> 13:27.110
You know what Carl was doing
while I was being defaced?

13:27.197 --> 13:28.808
De-laughing?

13:30.635 --> 13:31.898
This is on you.

13:31.985 --> 13:33.421
You didn't take his side
against Christina

13:33.508 --> 13:35.510
and now my partner
no longer has my back.

13:35.597 --> 13:38.208
My big, spray-painted back.

13:38.295 --> 13:41.646
I'm sorry this happened,
but I'm not choosing sides.

13:41.733 --> 13:44.171
[Mike]
'Fine, but good luck gettin'
sperm from a dead man!'

13:44.258 --> 13:47.000
I do it every night
you eat pizza.

13:53.049 --> 13:54.877
Not one monster of color.

13:56.748 --> 13:59.099
They'll let the lagoon be black,
but not the creature.

14:00.970 --> 14:02.406
[doorbell rings]

14:08.108 --> 14:09.413
- Hey.
- Hi, Carl.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.676
Sorry to just stop by like this.

14:11.763 --> 14:12.939
If you and Mike
are having troubles

14:13.026 --> 14:14.331
I don't want to get
in the middle of it.

14:14.418 --> 14:15.724
I'm not one to take sides.

14:17.552 --> 14:18.814
I know you're mad at me

14:18.901 --> 14:20.294
for staying friends
with Christina.

14:20.381 --> 14:22.818
What? Just because
you're BFFs with the B-I-T-C-H

14:22.905 --> 14:25.995
who B-R-O-K-E my H-E-A-R-T?

14:26.082 --> 14:28.737
Instead of spelling on the
porch, can we just talk inside?

14:28.824 --> 14:31.609
Alright.

14:31.696 --> 14:33.873
I don't know
what there is to talk about.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.831
You chose Christina's friendship
over mine.

14:35.918 --> 14:37.224
I did not choose her over you.

14:37.311 --> 14:38.703
I shouldn't have to.
That's the point.

14:38.790 --> 14:40.401
And I shouldn't have
to protect a grown man

14:40.488 --> 14:42.533
from getting his back
spray-painted by two children.

14:45.275 --> 14:46.929
Right, I mean,
you'd think he'd have heard

14:47.016 --> 14:49.627
the giggling
or the shaking of the can.

14:51.891 --> 14:55.111
I even honked the horn
two times. Man didn't even turn.

14:56.765 --> 14:58.201
[chuckles]

14:58.288 --> 15:00.073
Look, just because I'm still
friends with Christina

15:00.160 --> 15:02.336
that doesn't mean
I don't care about you.

15:02.423 --> 15:04.077
You, you do realize that
if it wasn't for me

15:04.164 --> 15:05.643
you and Mike
wouldn't have even met.

15:05.730 --> 15:07.863
I do.

15:07.950 --> 15:10.518
I also know that you'd never let
any real harm come to him.

15:10.605 --> 15:12.128
Yeah, on or off the job.

15:12.215 --> 15:15.392
I understand the meaning
of friendship.

15:15.479 --> 15:18.526
And you're always gonna be
an important part of our lives.

15:18.613 --> 15:21.137
- Yeah?
- Of course.

15:21.224 --> 15:23.400
Our kids are gonna need
their Uncle Carl.

15:23.487 --> 15:26.360
Mmm. Uncle Carl.

15:26.447 --> 15:29.624
But won't that be confusing
if he's also named Carl?

15:33.802 --> 15:35.151
No, we're not really
at the point

15:35.238 --> 15:37.458
of picking out names yet.

15:37.545 --> 15:40.200
Better tell your husband
to quit making promises.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.162
You know,
my middle name's Enoch.

15:49.513 --> 15:51.037
You got any use for that?

15:53.300 --> 15:56.520
- Enoch Biggs?
- Yeah.

15:56.607 --> 15:58.261
Can I think about it?

16:04.789 --> 16:07.662
- Hey, girl. Everything alright?
- Yeah, sorry, I'm late.

16:07.749 --> 16:09.969
I had a friend going
through a bit of a crisis.

16:10.056 --> 16:12.797
Oh, no problem.
Is she okay?

16:12.884 --> 16:16.236
Uh, yeah, yeah, she'sfine.

16:19.326 --> 16:20.588
I don't know why I just lied.

16:20.675 --> 16:22.938
It's not a she
we're talking about.

16:23.025 --> 16:26.333
- It's Carl.
- Oh, Carl.

16:26.420 --> 16:27.725
How's he doing?

16:27.812 --> 16:29.553
Doin' good, yeah.

16:29.640 --> 16:32.208
Considering, you know,
the breakup and everything.

16:32.295 --> 16:33.731
Which is none of my business

16:33.818 --> 16:37.300
'cause you're both
still my friends.

16:37.387 --> 16:40.173
I'm sure
he'll be fine eventually.

16:40.260 --> 16:42.392
Oh, absolutely.
He'll bounce back.

16:42.479 --> 16:45.352
He's just a little
emotional right now.

16:45.439 --> 16:47.571
He can be so childish sometimes.

16:49.225 --> 16:51.184
Well, I don't know
if I'd call him childish.

16:51.271 --> 16:53.403
I mean, he certainly wears
his heart on his sleeve.

16:53.490 --> 16:56.363
Definitely challenging being
in a relationship with him.

16:56.450 --> 16:59.844
I've never dated a man
that cried more than me.

16:59.931 --> 17:02.586
He does get weepy,
but that's why we love him.

17:02.673 --> 17:04.545
I mean..

17:04.632 --> 17:06.982
...not you anymore, but..

17:07.069 --> 17:08.723
...that's none of my business.

17:10.594 --> 17:12.727
Do you know how many
hysterical voice messages

17:12.814 --> 17:15.512
that man has left me
since we broke up?

17:15.599 --> 17:16.905
I do not.

17:16.992 --> 17:18.994
Uh, he and I don't
talk about you.

17:19.081 --> 17:20.169
We probably shouldn't
talk about him.

17:20.256 --> 17:21.736
Fifty-five.

17:24.521 --> 17:26.958
That's only crazy
if you really..

17:27.046 --> 17:29.744
...stop to think about it.

17:29.831 --> 17:32.225
My six-year-old son
has more sense than him.

17:32.312 --> 17:34.096
Okay, that's
a little harsh.

17:34.183 --> 17:35.750
I mean, I could
overlook the fact

17:35.837 --> 17:37.360
that he still lives
with his grandma

17:37.447 --> 17:39.754
but the man was so clingy.

17:39.841 --> 17:42.409
Do you know how many times
he asked me to marry him?

17:42.496 --> 17:44.889
South or North of 55?

17:44.976 --> 17:47.370
Almost every other day.

17:47.457 --> 17:48.980
Every time
I took a bite of something

17:49.068 --> 17:52.332
I was worried I was gonna
swallow an engagement ring.

17:52.419 --> 17:57.163
- Mmm. He's kind of a romantic.
- He's kind of a nitwit.

17:57.250 --> 18:00.470
Alright, you know what,
name-calling is not okay.

18:00.557 --> 18:03.734
He's a friend of mine, godfather
to my un-conceived child

18:03.821 --> 18:05.823
and if you're gonna
keep trash-talking him

18:05.910 --> 18:07.825
then do it curbside.

18:07.912 --> 18:10.785
- Y-you're kidding.
- Yeah, hit the bricks, sister.

18:10.872 --> 18:11.829
If you're gonna take
the low road

18:11.916 --> 18:14.832
you're gonna take it on foot.

18:14.919 --> 18:17.922
I don't believe this.
You're as crazy as he is.

18:18.009 --> 18:21.056
Well, that works out fine
because I choose him.

18:23.711 --> 18:26.192
Fifty-five messages,
you nitwit.

18:36.027 --> 18:37.333
You've come early.
Everything okay?

18:37.420 --> 18:40.684
I think I just broke up
with Christina.

18:40.771 --> 18:41.859
What are you talkin' about?

18:41.946 --> 18:43.383
She started bad-mouthing Carl

18:43.470 --> 18:45.646
and next thing I knew
I just kick her out of my car

18:45.733 --> 18:48.649
and giving her the finger
in my rearview mirror.

18:48.736 --> 18:51.260
That certainly sounds
like a breakup.

18:51.347 --> 18:52.566
What was she saying about him?

18:52.653 --> 18:55.482
She called him a clingy,
needy crybaby.

18:55.569 --> 18:58.311
She's not wrong.

18:58.398 --> 18:59.877
I know, but for some reason

18:59.964 --> 19:02.010
I started getting
very protective of him.

19:02.097 --> 19:03.272
I get it.

19:03.359 --> 19:04.708
He's a giant pain in the ass

19:04.795 --> 19:06.101
but you can't help
but love him.

19:06.188 --> 19:09.104
I know. Why is that?

19:09.191 --> 19:11.062
For me, I think
it's his round, bald head.

19:11.150 --> 19:14.501
He looks like a big, goofy baby.

19:14.588 --> 19:17.112
I bet that's it. He brings out
my maternal instincts.

19:17.199 --> 19:19.680
Mine too. He pisses me off
most of the time

19:19.767 --> 19:21.464
but I can't stop loving him.

19:21.551 --> 19:23.640
Mmm, I feel the same way.

19:23.727 --> 19:25.207
Like good parents.

19:27.122 --> 19:28.819
So maybe we are ready.

19:28.906 --> 19:30.430
And raising actual kids
won't be nearly

19:30.517 --> 19:33.041
as much trouble
as raising Carl.

19:33.128 --> 19:37.654
How could it be? Oh, I bet
they cry a lot less too.

19:37.741 --> 19:39.221
Well, I'm ready if you are.

19:40.788 --> 19:42.572
Let's do it.
Put your hat on.

19:42.659 --> 19:44.835
Mmm.
Frontwards or backwards?

19:44.922 --> 19:46.707
- Mike!
- I'm talking about the hat.

19:46.794 --> 19:49.144
Oh. Backwards.

19:55.933 --> 19:57.544
[theme music]
