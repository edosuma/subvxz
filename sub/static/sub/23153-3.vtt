00:08.843 --> 00:09.969
<i>A year has passed.</i>

00:10.136 --> 00:14.474
<i>A year since Meg married.</i>

00:14.641 --> 00:16.768
<i>Since I sold my novel.</i>

00:16.935 --> 00:18.978
<i>It failed.</i>

00:19.145 --> 00:20.897
If I get bigger

00:21.064 --> 00:23.525
I won't be able to wear
any clothes at all!

00:23.692 --> 00:25.026
I'll have to wrap myself
in sheets

00:25.193 --> 00:27.237
and stay in the house
till the baby arrives!

00:27.404 --> 00:29.239
This skirt has
plenty of room in it, Meg.

00:29.406 --> 00:31.950
And I promise you,
I've added so many frills

00:32.117 --> 00:34.744
the eye will be drawn away
from everything that's going on.

00:34.911 --> 00:37.664
No one will look lower
than your shoulders.

00:41.251 --> 00:42.377
Oh!

00:45.380 --> 00:48.216
<i>I can't even write a diary
anymore!</i>

00:48.383 --> 00:50.802
<i>And yet my head
is full of words.</i>

00:50.969 --> 00:52.721
A magnificent harvest,

00:52.887 --> 00:54.264
if I do say so!

00:54.431 --> 00:55.849
Are you sure
they can be spared?

00:56.015 --> 00:57.684
Of course they can.

01:01.354 --> 01:03.440
She's a terrible big size
for a terrible small girl,

01:03.606 --> 01:04.899
Mrs. March.

01:05.066 --> 01:06.526
Meg is young,
and she's healthy.

01:06.693 --> 01:09.070
There is no reason to suppose
that she will struggle

01:09.237 --> 01:10.530
when the time comes.

01:18.079 --> 01:20.832
<i>Our house is full of stories;</i>

01:20.999 --> 01:24.419
<i>lives unfolding.</i>

01:24.586 --> 01:27.172
<i>Wings waiting to take flight.</i>

02:04.000 --> 02:05.418
Jo!

02:05.585 --> 02:07.212
Why didn't you do your hair
the pretty way!

02:07.378 --> 02:08.922
Because I hate paying calls.

02:09.088 --> 02:10.799
And you don't need
your mackintosh!

02:10.965 --> 02:13.218
I can smell thunder,
even if you can't.

02:13.384 --> 02:15.303
If people care more for my
clothes than they do for me,

02:15.470 --> 02:17.847
I don't want to see them!
Please, Jo!

02:18.014 --> 02:19.808
We owe half a dozen calls
even before we go to see

02:19.974 --> 02:21.392
Aunt Carrol
at Aunt March's house.

02:21.559 --> 02:23.895
If you're going to be
in a contrary fit,

02:24.062 --> 02:25.563
you'll drive me distracted
before the day is out.

02:25.730 --> 02:27.524
Likewise.

02:27.690 --> 02:28.775
And remember--

02:28.942 --> 02:30.151
loop your gown up
in the street,

02:30.318 --> 02:31.402
and trail it in the house.

02:31.569 --> 02:32.904
Oh!

02:33.071 --> 02:34.197
Yes!

03:01.432 --> 03:04.269
Ah! Ooh...

03:07.438 --> 03:09.023
Please be set.

03:09.190 --> 03:11.693
Please!

03:16.406 --> 03:19.242
Florence's first season
was such a spectacular success

03:19.409 --> 03:22.704
that we're now intending
an entire program

03:22.871 --> 03:25.248
of new activities for her,
aren't we dearest?

03:25.415 --> 03:27.417
Yes, mother.
Not that she will neglect

03:27.584 --> 03:29.711
any opportunity to share
her advantages

03:29.878 --> 03:31.629
with those less fortunate.

03:31.796 --> 03:33.840
Tell me, Amy dear,

03:34.007 --> 03:35.425
are you much occupied
with charitable works?

03:35.592 --> 03:37.802
Marmee has always
encouraged us to support

03:37.969 --> 03:39.387
the Ladies Aid Society,
Aunt Carrol.

03:39.554 --> 03:41.681
And I'm tending a table

03:41.848 --> 03:43.391
at their bazaar on Saturday.

03:43.558 --> 03:45.059
And I don't doubt

03:45.226 --> 03:48.021
that it will be laden
with her pretty works of art.

03:48.187 --> 03:50.732
And what about you,
Josephine?

03:50.899 --> 03:53.192
Oh, my scribbling keeps me
too busy for charity schemes.

03:53.359 --> 03:55.361
By scribbling,
do you mean drawing, dear?

03:55.528 --> 03:57.780
Oh, Josephine doesn't draw.

03:57.947 --> 04:00.074
She writes romances,

04:00.241 --> 04:01.701
in the general way,

04:01.868 --> 04:04.537
with a dash of the spectacular
thrown in as a makeweight.

04:04.704 --> 04:07.790
I see.

04:07.957 --> 04:09.125
Does that amuse you, dear?

04:09.292 --> 04:10.460
It pays me.

04:12.295 --> 04:14.964
And how do you fare
with your languages?

04:15.131 --> 04:18.468
Oh, I don't know a word
of anything, only English.

04:18.635 --> 04:20.053
And I can't keep

04:20.219 --> 04:21.763
at any sort of study,

04:21.930 --> 04:23.431
and I can't bear French!

04:23.598 --> 04:25.850
It's a such a slippery,
silly sort of language.

04:26.017 --> 04:28.186
Don't you think?

04:32.106 --> 04:33.650
Hmph!

04:43.201 --> 04:44.452
Beth!

04:45.703 --> 04:46.829
What's the matter?

04:46.996 --> 04:48.081
Shall I call Marmee?

04:48.247 --> 04:50.124
Please don't.

04:50.291 --> 04:52.293
Don't call her,
and don't tell her.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.629
Are you in pain?

04:54.796 --> 04:56.005
A little.

04:56.172 --> 04:57.256
But I can bear it.

05:03.304 --> 05:05.682
You don't look as though
you're bearing it.

05:09.519 --> 05:11.938
Will you stroke my head?

05:17.235 --> 05:20.196
I wish you would tell me
what was troubling you.

05:20.363 --> 05:22.281
Not yet.

05:39.632 --> 05:42.552
I had a letter
from Aunt Carrol today.

05:42.719 --> 05:44.095
Did she grill you about
your charitable activities?

05:44.262 --> 05:45.555
No.

05:45.722 --> 05:49.308
She told me about her
forthcoming tour of Europe.

05:49.475 --> 05:52.228
And she says that
she needs a companion

05:52.395 --> 05:54.939
for her daughter Florence.

05:55.106 --> 05:57.608
So she has asked...

05:57.775 --> 05:58.901
Me to go with her.

06:00.903 --> 06:02.071
No, dear.

06:02.238 --> 06:04.574
Not you.

06:04.741 --> 06:06.117
Amy.

06:06.284 --> 06:08.411
Aunt Carrol wants <i>me</i>
to go to Europe with her?

06:08.578 --> 06:10.538
Eh, London, England.

06:10.705 --> 06:12.373
Stonehenge.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.834
Edinburgh,
Paris, France.

06:15.001 --> 06:17.003
Vienna.
Berlin.

06:17.170 --> 06:18.546
Venice, Italy.

06:18.713 --> 06:19.922
Athens.
Rome.

06:20.089 --> 06:21.424
Mr. Thomas Cook
will be arranging

06:21.591 --> 06:24.385
some very circuitous
rail connections.

06:24.552 --> 06:26.471
But she wants <i>me</i>
to go with her?

06:26.637 --> 06:31.559
I actually begged her
to take you off my hands,

06:31.726 --> 06:34.854
and she has my gratitude
for being so obliging.

06:47.158 --> 06:49.160
I'm sorry, Jo.

06:49.327 --> 06:51.287
I know how much
that would have meant to you.

06:51.454 --> 06:53.664
It isn't fair, Marmee.

06:53.831 --> 06:55.666
Amy gets all the fun

06:55.833 --> 06:57.668
and all I ever do is work.

06:57.835 --> 07:00.213
Jo, you would've had
a hard year;

07:00.379 --> 07:03.466
pretending to be someone
other than yourself.

07:03.633 --> 07:07.261
And I'm not sure that that
wouldn't have cost you dearly.

07:14.977 --> 07:16.395
Are you stitching that for Amy?

07:16.562 --> 07:19.190
How can you tell?

07:19.357 --> 07:21.692
I wish I could say
I do it gladly, but I don't.

07:21.859 --> 07:23.361
Oh, Jo...

07:23.528 --> 07:25.738
Don't speak to me kindly!

07:25.905 --> 07:27.240
I was too thoughtless,
and too blunt,

07:27.406 --> 07:28.491
and I have
an ungovernable tongue.

07:28.658 --> 07:31.285
I know how hurt you are.

07:31.452 --> 07:32.620
I can't let anyone see, Laurie.

07:32.787 --> 07:34.664
You never let people
see your soft side!

07:34.831 --> 07:36.833
But everyone who cares
knows it's there.

07:36.999 --> 07:38.960
I'd rather not talk about
my soft side at the moment.

07:39.127 --> 07:41.587
Why don't we talk
about you?

07:41.754 --> 07:43.297
And all your grand plans,

07:43.464 --> 07:44.674
now that you're
a college graduate?

07:44.841 --> 07:47.426
I don't have any grand plans.

07:47.593 --> 07:50.138
Grandfather's so pleased
and so relieved

07:50.304 --> 07:52.014
I think he'll let me
take a vacation

07:52.181 --> 07:54.058
for a while.

07:54.225 --> 07:55.309
Well, aren't you fortunate?

07:55.476 --> 07:57.186
Jo?

07:57.353 --> 07:58.646
Jo!

08:01.399 --> 08:03.109
Beth?

08:03.276 --> 08:05.069
John came to the house
to fetch Marmee.

08:05.236 --> 08:07.238
It's happening, Jo.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.419
We shall have to get her
lying down, Mrs. March.

08:21.586 --> 08:24.130
The girl is going
to exhaust herself!

08:24.297 --> 08:25.631
Good girl.

08:25.798 --> 08:26.966
Good girl!

08:29.343 --> 08:31.721
You didn't tell me!

08:31.888 --> 08:33.264
How did you ever survive it?

08:33.431 --> 08:35.516
Oh, I don't know, Meg.

08:35.683 --> 08:37.518
I don't believe
women ever know.

08:37.685 --> 08:39.312
But I did.

08:39.478 --> 08:41.647
We do!
And you will.

08:41.814 --> 08:44.400
I promise you
you will!

08:54.118 --> 08:55.286
Look at you, John!

08:55.453 --> 08:56.787
The man who has everything!

08:56.954 --> 08:58.706
I have a family at last.
I can want for nothing else.

09:00.208 --> 09:03.878
When do I find out
if it's a boy or a girl?

09:04.045 --> 09:06.214
You'll see.

09:06.380 --> 09:07.715
Come!

09:07.882 --> 09:10.176
Don't open your eyes yet.

09:19.143 --> 09:21.229
Surprise!

09:21.395 --> 09:23.356
By Jupiter...

09:23.522 --> 09:24.941
Twins?

09:25.107 --> 09:26.192
A boy...

09:26.359 --> 09:27.360
and a girl!

09:27.526 --> 09:29.362
I out a blue bow on one of them

09:29.528 --> 09:30.905
and a pink one on the other,

09:31.072 --> 09:32.198
French fashion.

09:34.325 --> 09:36.077
It's the joke of the season,
isn't it?

09:46.379 --> 09:47.505
A son and a daughter.

09:51.050 --> 09:54.720
Do you suppose one day
she'll say to me,

09:54.887 --> 09:56.722
"How did you ever survive this?"

09:57.890 --> 09:59.725
Very possibly.

09:59.892 --> 10:02.812
And you can say, "You will."

10:05.481 --> 10:07.441
Thank you, Marmee.

10:11.821 --> 10:13.698
Laurie might ride by
in a moment.

10:16.867 --> 10:18.160
He went out to play
billiards tonight,

10:18.327 --> 10:22.623
and this is the time
he usually comes home.

10:22.790 --> 10:23.916
Here he is.

10:25.751 --> 10:26.877
All serene on the front!

10:31.424 --> 10:33.134
I like it so much
when he does that.

10:33.301 --> 10:36.637
He looks so strong
and well and happy.

10:44.228 --> 10:46.272
Goodbye!

10:46.439 --> 10:48.316
We'll miss you!

10:48.482 --> 10:49.567
Goodbye!

10:56.240 --> 10:58.993
Be safe, sweetheart.

10:59.160 --> 11:01.162
Write to us!

11:01.329 --> 11:02.747
I'll write
when I get to England.

11:06.208 --> 11:08.627
Bye!

11:23.184 --> 11:25.061
First nip of fall
in the air.

11:29.023 --> 11:30.733
No pen and no ink today?

11:30.900 --> 11:32.068
I've penned and I've inked

11:32.234 --> 11:33.903
in every room of the house
this week

11:34.070 --> 11:36.072
and not one has proved
more conducive than the garret.

11:41.285 --> 11:42.369
Where are you floating off to,

11:42.536 --> 11:43.829
on that cloud of cologne
and pomade?

11:43.996 --> 11:45.790
Eugenia Randall's house.

11:45.956 --> 11:47.208
Eugenia Randall?

11:47.374 --> 11:49.001
Is she the girl
you sent a rose to

11:49.168 --> 11:50.544
every morning
of your sophomore year?

11:50.711 --> 11:51.879
She's giving a tea party,

11:52.046 --> 11:54.173
so everyone can see
her engagement presents.

11:54.340 --> 11:55.424
She was a delicious romp,

11:55.591 --> 11:56.884
and a fine flirt...

11:57.051 --> 11:58.552
Marmee doesn't like
that sort of girl.

11:58.719 --> 12:01.097
Marmee didn't raise
that sort of girl.

12:01.263 --> 12:03.724
I wouldn't know how to flirt,
even if she had allowed it.

12:05.851 --> 12:07.603
I flirt constantly;

12:07.770 --> 12:09.605
I can't help myself.

12:09.772 --> 12:14.318
But what I really like are
sensible, straightforward,

12:14.485 --> 12:15.903
modest young women.

12:24.453 --> 12:25.830
Jo!

12:25.996 --> 12:27.081
Jo, dear!

12:27.248 --> 12:29.083
I want you.

12:34.672 --> 12:37.258
Laurie.

12:37.424 --> 12:40.136
This won't do.

12:54.608 --> 12:55.818
What is it, Jo?

12:58.904 --> 13:00.030
I want to go away.

13:00.197 --> 13:01.740
Where?

13:01.907 --> 13:04.285
To a hospital in a big city

13:04.451 --> 13:06.453
to train to be a nurse.

13:06.620 --> 13:07.830
No, Jo! No. No.

13:07.997 --> 13:09.206
Besides, the war is over.

13:09.373 --> 13:12.209
Do you think disease
has stopped existing,

13:12.376 --> 13:13.878
because the country
is at peace?

13:14.044 --> 13:15.588
People will always need help,
Marmee.

13:15.754 --> 13:17.965
And what do you need, Jo?

13:18.132 --> 13:19.800
Because-- and forgive me
if I sound disrespectful--

13:19.967 --> 13:23.179
I don't believe the state
of the sick and the suffering

13:23.345 --> 13:25.806
is your principal concern.

13:25.973 --> 13:27.933
I need to not live out
my entire life

13:28.100 --> 13:29.268
in the tiny town

13:29.435 --> 13:30.811
where I was born.

13:30.978 --> 13:34.148
I need to see things,
and be things,

13:34.315 --> 13:36.108
because I'm terrified
that if I don't,

13:36.275 --> 13:39.653
my writing will have to be
forced out of nothing,

13:39.820 --> 13:41.780
and go nowhere!

13:41.947 --> 13:43.616
And I need to get away
from Laurie.

13:46.577 --> 13:49.955
He's become...
fond of me.

13:50.122 --> 13:53.500
And, uh...

13:53.667 --> 13:55.711
you don't think you could
become fond of him?

13:55.878 --> 13:57.171
No.

13:57.338 --> 14:00.049
I love him,
but like I've always loved him.

14:00.215 --> 14:01.216
Like a brother.

14:01.383 --> 14:03.552
And that won't change.

14:03.719 --> 14:05.387
I know it won't change.

14:06.680 --> 14:07.765
Good.

14:07.932 --> 14:10.100
Because you and Laurie...

14:10.267 --> 14:12.102
You're too much alike,

14:12.269 --> 14:16.440
both have hot tempers
and strong wills.

14:18.150 --> 14:23.656
Marriage takes infinite patience
and forbearance, Jo.

14:23.822 --> 14:24.990
As well as love.

14:25.157 --> 14:27.117
I know that.

14:27.284 --> 14:31.413
Because I have seen that.

14:32.289 --> 14:33.832
But I'm not sure

14:33.999 --> 14:36.085
I could manage it with anybody,

14:36.251 --> 14:38.837
and I don't intend to try.

14:46.470 --> 14:49.473
Laurie needs a girl like Beth,
Marmee.

14:49.640 --> 14:52.101
Like Beth?

14:52.267 --> 14:54.395
Beth loves Laurie.

14:54.561 --> 14:58.732
In the most tender,
most hopeful, most hopeless way.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.985
And that what's been
troubling her?

15:01.151 --> 15:02.528
It's been breaking
her heart!

15:02.695 --> 15:04.822
And it will break mine too
if I stand in the way

15:04.989 --> 15:07.449
of what might be
the better thing.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.384
You'll hate New York.

15:25.551 --> 15:27.052
I might,

15:27.219 --> 15:28.721
but I like the sound
of Mrs. Kirke's boarding house.

15:28.887 --> 15:31.974
You're going there as a
governess to her children.

15:32.141 --> 15:33.600
If she didn't need a governess,

15:33.767 --> 15:35.060
and she wasn't an old friend
of Marmee's,

15:35.227 --> 15:37.146
I wouldn't be going to New York
at all.

15:50.325 --> 15:52.494
<i>"Dear Marmee and Beth.</i>

15:52.661 --> 15:55.080
<i>"I kept trying not to remember
Father's face,</i>

15:55.247 --> 15:57.124
<i>"when I left him

15:57.291 --> 15:59.376
<i>But the sun came out,

16:06.300 --> 16:08.427
<i>"Independence has its charms.</i>

16:08.594 --> 16:12.514
<i>"It also has its challenges.</i>

16:12.681 --> 16:14.057
<i>"But I make shift,</i>

16:14.224 --> 16:16.059
<i>and so far haven't disgraced
myself at all."</i>

16:20.481 --> 16:23.233
<i>"Mrs. Kirke's house

16:25.736 --> 16:28.155
<i>"There are two French ladies,</i>

16:28.322 --> 16:31.450
<i>"and three engineers fresh
off the boat from Sweden.</i>

16:33.160 --> 16:36.121
<i>"There's a professor
from Germany.</i>

16:36.288 --> 16:39.625
<i>He's raising two nephews,

16:42.002 --> 16:44.296
<i>"He has a beard</i>

16:44.463 --> 16:46.507

16:46.673 --> 16:48.759
"Or perhaps I just think that,

16:48.926 --> 16:50.010
"because I keep being told

16:50.177 --> 16:52.596
what a splendid man he is."

16:52.763 --> 16:55.891
<i>"And because it's so very
obvious he's poor.</i>

16:56.058 --> 16:59.645
<i>"Poverty always enriches those
who rise above it.</i>

Oh, child!

17:24.711 --> 17:26.547
This is too heavy for such
a little one as you.

17:26.713 --> 17:27.798
Give it to me.

17:27.965 --> 17:29.049
Thank you.

17:31.134 --> 17:32.386
It always pains me,

17:32.553 --> 17:35.138
when a child must earn
their bread.

17:35.305 --> 17:37.266
Yes.

17:37.432 --> 17:41.478
It pains me too.

Kitty! Minnie!

18:18.640 --> 18:20.976
What in mercy's name
are you doing?

18:22.269 --> 18:24.688
We are playing a game
of menagerie, Miss March.

18:24.855 --> 18:28.650
Franz and Emil are a tiger
and lion respectively,

18:28.817 --> 18:29.943
hence their incarceration

18:30.110 --> 18:31.737
behind the dining chairs.

18:31.904 --> 18:33.405
Minnie's feeding them
ginger cake.

18:33.572 --> 18:35.407
A very particular ginger cake,

18:35.574 --> 18:39.494
formulated for the
mammalian species Felidae.

18:41.163 --> 18:42.789
Meanwhile I am an elephant.

18:42.956 --> 18:44.041
No ginger cake for me.

19:05.103 --> 19:06.188
You write fast?

19:06.355 --> 19:08.065
Faster,
since I've been here.

19:08.231 --> 19:09.691
Twenty dollars, twenty dollars,
twenty dollars.

19:09.858 --> 19:11.902
I'll only pay ten for this,

19:12.069 --> 19:14.404
because stories of sisterly love
don't generally appeal.

19:14.571 --> 19:16.281
They appeal to me, sir.

19:16.448 --> 19:17.991
Ten.
And that's my final offer.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.868
However, bring me more
like these

19:20.035 --> 19:21.495
and you'll be published
once a fortnight.

19:21.662 --> 19:22.913
Twenty dollars every time.

19:24.623 --> 19:26.333
<i>"Und Gott dru ckte</i>

19:26.500 --> 19:27.876

19:34.257 --> 19:35.634
Hand in Hand."

19:37.219 --> 19:40.681
Now Miss March will now read
from the English book,

19:40.847 --> 19:43.433
so as to learn
our language lesson.

19:43.600 --> 19:47.104
"Then the child
opened his eyes

19:47.270 --> 19:50.691
"and looked into the glorious
happy face of the angel,

19:50.857 --> 19:52.609
"and at the same moment
they found themselves

19:52.776 --> 19:54.027
"in that heavenly home,

19:54.194 --> 19:56.863
"where all is happiness
and joy.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.700
"And God pressed the dead child

19:59.866 --> 20:01.702
"and wings were given him

20:01.868 --> 20:05.664
so that he could fly
with the angel, hand in hand."

20:15.298 --> 20:16.883
Miss March?

20:17.050 --> 20:18.719
Pray tell if I disturb you.

20:18.885 --> 20:19.970
You are writing home?

20:20.137 --> 20:21.888
Ah no,
I'm just writing.

20:22.055 --> 20:26.518
Erm... might I enquire
as to whether you have

20:26.685 --> 20:28.895
any fondness for philosophy?

20:29.062 --> 20:30.480
I've read a little

20:30.647 --> 20:32.149
Immanuel Kant,

20:32.315 --> 20:34.109
but I struggle with his notion

20:34.276 --> 20:35.694
that we don't conform
to the world,

20:35.861 --> 20:37.195
but the world conforms to us.

20:37.362 --> 20:40.824
<i>Ja</i>, well, I struggle
with that also.

20:40.991 --> 20:44.786
Um, I find greater coherence
in the views of Hegel.

20:44.953 --> 20:46.163
Yes.

20:46.329 --> 20:47.456
Exactly.

20:47.622 --> 20:49.458
Yeah, well there is
a symposium--

20:49.624 --> 20:51.877
um... a debate--

20:52.044 --> 20:54.129
to be held next week.

20:54.296 --> 20:55.547
May I take the liberty
of purchasing admission

20:55.714 --> 20:56.840
for us both?

21:00.260 --> 21:02.512
Ah, I would like that.

21:02.679 --> 21:04.139
<i>Ja?</i>

21:04.306 --> 21:06.183
<i>Ja</i>, that's great!

21:08.560 --> 21:09.770
<i>Ja.</i>

21:16.735 --> 21:18.570
I called into the library

21:18.737 --> 21:20.155
to look up the works
of Mr. Hegel.

21:20.322 --> 21:21.406
And I agree with him.

21:21.573 --> 21:22.908
If everything I know

21:23.075 --> 21:25.160
comes from my sensations
of the world,

21:25.327 --> 21:26.620
there must then
exist a world

21:26.787 --> 21:27.913
to provide me
with such sensations!

21:28.080 --> 21:29.414
Yes.

21:29.581 --> 21:31.041
Yes, exactly.

21:31.208 --> 21:32.334
<i>Ja?</i>

21:39.216 --> 21:40.967
<i>"No matter where I go,</i>

21:41.134 --> 21:44.304

<i>"I guess everyone just buys</i>

22:03.698 --> 22:05.492
<i>new shoes all of the time."</i>

22:10.288 --> 22:12.415
Hurry! The maids will be
coming in to set the table.

22:12.582 --> 22:14.376
Take those painted eggs
to your room,

22:14.543 --> 22:15.710
and leave them anywhere

22:15.877 --> 22:17.212
where they'll be smashed
or trampled,

22:17.379 --> 22:18.880
or everyone's labors
will have been in vain,

22:19.047 --> 22:20.507
including mine!

22:22.134 --> 22:24.386
My nephews enjoy their
handicrafts with you.

22:25.679 --> 22:27.514
I like teaching boys.

22:27.681 --> 22:29.891
Better than teaching girls--
but don't tell Mrs. Kirke.

22:30.058 --> 22:31.184
No. No! Shh!

22:33.395 --> 22:36.439
Observe this,
this illustration!

22:36.606 --> 22:38.733
I wince to surmise
what adventures it depicts,

22:38.900 --> 22:40.110
and think it should not be

22:40.277 --> 22:43.572
brought into a house
where there are children.

22:43.738 --> 22:45.240
Look, more of it there is!

22:45.407 --> 22:46.950
It's better they play
with gunpowder,

22:47.117 --> 22:48.451
than they read such things!

22:48.618 --> 22:50.036
<i>The Weekly Volcano?</i>

22:50.203 --> 22:52.080
Let it burn.

22:52.247 --> 22:53.498
You know,
I have no patience

22:53.665 --> 22:56.626
for those who create
this bad trash!

22:56.793 --> 22:59.254
In which case, Professor Bhaer,
you have no patience with me.

22:59.421 --> 23:02.007
Every other week, I publish
a story in that magazine.

23:02.174 --> 23:04.009
And every penny I've earn
in exchange for them

23:04.176 --> 23:05.719
goes to the good
of someone I love.

23:05.886 --> 23:08.805
My sister, as it happens.

23:08.972 --> 23:11.600
I shouldn't have to explain
how much a sister can matter.

23:11.766 --> 23:13.643
Not to you.

23:13.810 --> 23:16.438
Wait...

23:16.605 --> 23:18.523
Your sister is sick?

23:19.566 --> 23:21.193
She isn't strong.

23:23.153 --> 23:25.530
I have been saving up
so I can take her to the ocean.

23:29.367 --> 23:32.662
Does that still make my stories
"bad trash" in your eyes?

23:55.644 --> 23:58.271
I have not words

23:58.438 --> 24:01.274
sufficient to apologize.

24:01.441 --> 24:04.277
I wish instead

24:04.444 --> 24:06.988
to present a gift.

24:11.952 --> 24:13.203
<i>The Complete Works
of Shakespeare?</i>

24:13.370 --> 24:14.829
Mm.

24:14.996 --> 24:18.208
There is a universe of
literature within these boards.

24:19.876 --> 24:22.379
Shakespeare earned his living
by his pen.

24:22.545 --> 24:26.091
He wrote spectaculars,
and he entertained the people.

24:26.258 --> 24:31.388
But he also created
works of such beauty

24:31.554 --> 24:35.517
that the world is still
sustained by them.

24:35.684 --> 24:38.061
One need not exclude
the other.

24:41.982 --> 24:44.192
You know so much more than I do.

24:44.359 --> 24:46.736
That only makes me learned.

24:48.989 --> 24:51.366
It does not make me wise.

24:53.243 --> 24:54.369
I am wiser now.

24:56.454 --> 24:58.915
Professor Bhaer...

24:59.082 --> 25:02.627
I've decided to go home
for a short while.

25:02.794 --> 25:05.714
I'm leaving next week.

25:05.880 --> 25:08.675
Um, so, so suddenly?

25:08.842 --> 25:10.260
I've had another payment,

25:10.427 --> 25:12.220
which means I have enough
to take my sister to the sea.

25:14.514 --> 25:15.640
She needs the air very badly.

25:15.807 --> 25:17.934
But you will return?

25:20.061 --> 25:22.147
To New York?

25:22.314 --> 25:23.440
Yes.

25:25.233 --> 25:26.526
Yes.

25:37.704 --> 25:40.915
Godspeed you on your journey,
Miss March.

25:41.082 --> 25:42.459
I'll see you in four weeks.

25:42.625 --> 25:43.752
<i>Ja.</i>

25:51.217 --> 25:52.385
Write often!

25:52.552 --> 25:53.636
Bye!
Safe journeys!

26:31.841 --> 26:33.551
Jo, we're going
to have to have this out.

26:33.718 --> 26:35.053
Have what out?

26:36.179 --> 26:37.263
I've loved you

26:37.430 --> 26:38.848
ever since I've known you!

26:39.015 --> 26:40.266
And I can't help it,
even though I've tried.

26:40.433 --> 26:42.477
Laurie, I don't want
to have this conversation!

26:42.644 --> 26:43.728
I know you don't!

26:43.895 --> 26:46.106
I've tried to show
you how I feel,

26:46.272 --> 26:47.482
but you refused to see it.

26:47.649 --> 26:49.150
So now I'm going
to make you hear it,

26:49.317 --> 26:51.111
and give me an answer!

26:51.277 --> 26:53.154
Jo!

26:53.321 --> 26:55.073
I don't want you
to be unhappy, Laurie!

26:55.240 --> 26:56.783
I went away
so that you wouldn't be.

26:56.950 --> 26:58.284
It was no use.

26:58.451 --> 27:00.370
I spent the whole time
trying to turn myself

27:00.537 --> 27:02.247
into someone good enough
for you to love.

27:02.414 --> 27:03.498
You are good enough.

27:03.665 --> 27:05.125
You've always been
good enough!

27:05.291 --> 27:07.585
I just can't love you
in the way that you want me to.

27:07.752 --> 27:09.629
I've tried,
and I won't lie

27:09.796 --> 27:11.756
and say I love you like that
when I don't.

27:14.175 --> 27:16.511
Have you really,
truly tried?

27:17.679 --> 27:18.888
Really.

27:19.055 --> 27:21.057
Truly.

27:45.957 --> 27:47.125
Oh.

27:47.292 --> 27:48.710
Teddy, I'm sorry.

27:53.548 --> 27:56.468
I'm so desperately sorry!

27:58.094 --> 28:00.221
I'd kill myself
if I thought it would help.

28:00.388 --> 28:02.307
In what way would that help, Jo?

28:02.474 --> 28:03.766
I don't know!

28:03.933 --> 28:05.643
But it would be easier
than making myself love you

28:05.810 --> 28:07.437
when I don't!

28:07.604 --> 28:09.606
That can't be done.
Some people manage it.

28:09.772 --> 28:11.357
I don't believe
in that sort of love,

28:11.524 --> 28:13.735
and I don't intend to try.

28:16.696 --> 28:19.032
I have something to tell you.

28:20.658 --> 28:22.827
If it's about that old man,

28:22.994 --> 28:24.662
I'd rather not hear it.

28:24.829 --> 28:26.122
What old man?

28:26.289 --> 28:28.833
That professor you were
always writing home about.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.335
Professor Bhaer?

28:30.502 --> 28:32.212
We're friends, Laurie.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.631
We talk about literature
and plays, and...

28:34.797 --> 28:37.300
You go to philosophical
symposiums together!

28:37.467 --> 28:38.635
We went to one
philosophical symposium!

28:38.801 --> 28:40.261
If you tell me you love him,

28:40.428 --> 28:42.347
<i>I'll</i> be the one
who kills myself!

28:42.514 --> 28:44.516
I haven't the least idea
of loving Professor Bhaer

28:44.682 --> 28:46.768
or anybody else.
You will in the end!

28:46.935 --> 28:49.479
And so will <i>you</i> in the end!

29:10.124 --> 29:12.710
You grew out your hair.

29:14.963 --> 29:16.548
I thought you might care for it.

29:23.638 --> 29:27.433
I'll never love
anyone but you.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.227
Laurie...

29:29.394 --> 29:32.188
Be sensible.

29:32.355 --> 29:34.357
I will not be sensible.

29:34.524 --> 29:36.734
I can't be sensible, Jo!

29:38.528 --> 29:39.946
I don't believe
you've got any heart at all!

29:40.113 --> 29:42.198
And I wish I hadn't!

29:51.457 --> 29:54.252
<i>Love cannot be forced, Laurie.</i>

29:54.419 --> 29:55.461
Well that's what she said.

29:55.628 --> 29:57.213
And I'd rather hang myself

29:57.380 --> 29:58.965
than live in a world where
she won't change her mind.

29:59.132 --> 30:03.344
Sometimes the only response
to the provocation of a woman

30:03.511 --> 30:05.722
is to take it like a man.

30:05.888 --> 30:08.266
What if I can't take it
like a man?

30:09.851 --> 30:12.228
Then take yourself abroad.

30:19.611 --> 30:20.737
You said I could travel,

30:20.903 --> 30:22.405
once I graduated.

30:22.572 --> 30:24.240
But I didn't think
I would be traveling alone.

30:24.407 --> 30:25.533
You wouldn't be alone.

30:25.700 --> 30:27.076
I wouldn't be with Jo.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.622
There's at least
one person

30:30.788 --> 30:33.291
who'd go to the end of the earth
with you.

30:34.334 --> 30:35.418
Who?

30:35.585 --> 30:38.212
Me.

30:38.379 --> 30:40.340
Thank you.

30:40.506 --> 30:41.758
Sir.

30:41.924 --> 30:44.969
I went through all of this
when I was your age.

30:45.136 --> 30:48.890
And then again,
when it was your father's turn.

30:53.353 --> 30:55.647
May I advise against
the "Sonata Pathétique"...

30:58.566 --> 31:01.110
until we're feeling more robust?

32:01.796 --> 32:04.590
You have a bay scallop

32:04.757 --> 32:08.553
and an angel wing here.

32:08.720 --> 32:10.513
Do you want me to look
the other ones up in the book?

32:11.848 --> 32:13.641
Later.

32:21.858 --> 32:24.277
You know, don't you, Jo?

32:31.117 --> 32:32.702
Yes.

32:34.662 --> 32:37.373
I wanted to tell you,

32:37.540 --> 32:40.293
but I couldn't.

32:40.460 --> 32:42.879
I've known
for a long time.

32:44.839 --> 32:46.340
I suspected,
and I wanted to be wrong

32:46.507 --> 32:47.759
so I went to Dr. Bangs,

32:47.925 --> 32:50.052
so he could tell me
not to be so silly.

32:52.430 --> 32:55.516
And he didn't.

33:00.146 --> 33:03.191
Now I'm used to it,
it isn't hard to bear.

33:03.357 --> 33:05.193
Except I've been
keeping a secret.

33:05.359 --> 33:07.403
Is that what was troubling you
last autumn?

33:09.405 --> 33:11.032
Yes.

33:12.575 --> 33:13.659
It wasn't to do with Laurie?

33:13.826 --> 33:16.120
Why would it be to do
with Laurie?

33:18.372 --> 33:21.876
Apart from seeing him
so strong, and well,

33:22.043 --> 33:24.504
and so full of happy plans,
like all of you.

33:24.670 --> 33:28.007
But you kept it a secret.

33:28.174 --> 33:29.926
You didn't let us comfort you

33:30.092 --> 33:31.469
or help you.

33:31.636 --> 33:34.263
Why did you try to shut us out
and bear it all alone?

33:39.143 --> 33:41.604
I didn't want to be selfish.

33:41.771 --> 33:44.357
I didn't want
to frighten Marmee,

33:44.524 --> 33:47.485
when she was already worried
about Meg and her confinement.

33:47.652 --> 33:50.029
You don't think we wanted
to care for you?

33:51.697 --> 33:54.116
You have to let us help you.

33:54.283 --> 33:55.701
You have to try to get well.

33:55.868 --> 33:57.036
I do try.

33:58.454 --> 34:00.623
But every day I lose
a little strength,

34:00.790 --> 34:03.960
and feel more certain
I shall never get it back.

34:08.464 --> 34:10.383
It's like the tide, Jo.

34:12.677 --> 34:15.846
When it turns, it goes slowly,
but it can't be stopped.

34:19.433 --> 34:21.936
<i>I'll</i> stop it!

34:22.103 --> 34:23.229
I'll fight it.

34:25.231 --> 34:27.900
I'll keep you alive

34:28.067 --> 34:30.236
whatever I have to do,

34:30.403 --> 34:33.489
and whatever I have
to give up to God.

34:34.740 --> 34:38.995
<i>This</i> is what He wants, Jo.

34:39.161 --> 34:41.289
He can't be that cruel.

34:44.625 --> 34:47.003
I don't want to let life go.

34:48.754 --> 34:51.132
I can only try to be willing.

34:52.842 --> 34:55.011
Will you tell Father and Marmee,
when we get home?

34:55.177 --> 34:56.262
I won't have to.

34:56.429 --> 34:57.555
But you must.

34:59.849 --> 35:02.810
And you must look after them.

35:02.977 --> 35:04.186
Promise me.

35:07.398 --> 35:08.858
I promise.

35:19.035 --> 35:20.119
Good afternoon,
Miss March!

35:20.286 --> 35:21.787
Laurie!

35:21.954 --> 35:24.457
Or should that be <i>Bonjour,
Mademoiselle Mars?</i>

35:24.624 --> 35:27.501
<i>Marmee a écrit que vous
serez à Sienne!</i>

35:27.668 --> 35:29.420
Your tenses are all
back to front, Amy!

35:33.591 --> 35:34.675
<i>I've been making</i>

35:34.842 --> 35:37.011
Herculaneum efforts
with my art.

35:37.178 --> 35:40.681
I thought the continent would
bring out the Raphael in you.

35:40.848 --> 35:41.974
It hasn't so far.

35:42.141 --> 35:45.478
And I tried oils in Paris,
drawing in Nice

35:45.645 --> 35:48.022
and absolutely everything
in Rome.

35:49.231 --> 35:50.358
You know...

35:52.526 --> 35:56.238
I'm starting to think
I might not be a genius.

35:56.405 --> 35:58.449
I think the same thing
every time I try to sit down

35:58.616 --> 36:00.618
and write my opera.

36:00.785 --> 36:02.787
You're writing an opera?

36:02.953 --> 36:05.539
Grandfather likes to see me
occupied.

36:05.706 --> 36:07.375
And I like Mozart
and Beethoven.

36:07.541 --> 36:10.795
Not that that
has got me anywhere.

36:25.434 --> 36:27.395
You've timed your return
to perfection,

36:27.561 --> 36:28.604
as it happens.

36:28.771 --> 36:30.689
The cat has had kittens again,

36:30.856 --> 36:32.608
and someone needs
to take them on

36:32.775 --> 36:35.986
as Hannah has threatened
to run them through her mangle.

36:36.153 --> 36:37.363
Marmee.

36:39.865 --> 36:40.991
Yes?

36:45.037 --> 36:46.163
I'm sick.

36:48.666 --> 36:50.376
And I'm not going to get better.

37:27.037 --> 37:29.415
She was the one
that I never made plans for!

37:33.127 --> 37:36.130
She was the one that I...

37:36.297 --> 37:38.674
I couldn't imagine married.

37:40.718 --> 37:43.220
She was the one I...

37:43.387 --> 37:46.265
I couldn't picture with
an infant in her arms.

37:48.851 --> 37:51.562
She knew she was dying
for a long time, Marmee.

37:51.729 --> 37:53.647
And all I knew was that she--

37:53.814 --> 37:57.193
she would never leave home!

37:57.359 --> 38:00.488
And I was content with that.

38:00.654 --> 38:04.408
I could keep her safe here.

38:08.579 --> 38:12.249
And now she's going
to go so far away from home

38:12.416 --> 38:18.631
that I won't be able
to guide her, or protect her.

38:18.797 --> 38:21.759
I... I...

38:21.926 --> 38:27.056
I won't be able
to be her mother!

38:27.223 --> 38:28.974
And she will need me, Jo.

38:29.141 --> 38:30.267
She will need me!

39:18.440 --> 39:19.775
I'm afraid
I might have overdone it

39:19.942 --> 39:22.194
with my embellishments.

39:22.361 --> 39:23.904
So many fresh flowers,

39:24.071 --> 39:26.615
I might as well
climb into a vase.

39:26.782 --> 39:28.367
I'm sorry.

39:28.534 --> 39:30.077
I... brought you some more.

39:34.748 --> 39:37.751
This stuff is nice.

39:37.918 --> 39:40.504
It's called illusion tulle.

39:40.671 --> 39:42.631
You can pin it
over the shabbiest gown,

39:42.798 --> 39:44.300
and shimmer like a moth
in candlelight.

39:44.466 --> 39:47.136
Which is lovely.

39:47.303 --> 39:48.971
Unless you don't like moths.

39:56.729 --> 39:58.814
Would you care to dance, Amy?

40:00.524 --> 40:02.610
One generally does, at a ball.

40:36.018 --> 40:37.144
Jo...

40:44.818 --> 40:46.195
Do the babies tire you?

40:47.946 --> 40:49.948
Yes.

40:51.575 --> 40:53.661
Shh...

42:12.072 --> 42:14.450
Beth, dear.

42:16.827 --> 42:20.205
You're going to have to
go on a journey.

42:22.583 --> 42:24.209
And you mustn't be afraid.

42:26.253 --> 42:30.632
You were always braver
than you knew.

42:39.850 --> 42:42.227
Rest here,
until you're ready.

43:30.400 --> 43:32.236
<i>"Take care of Amy, Teddy.</i>

43:32.402 --> 43:33.946
<i>"Stop.</i>

43:34.112 --> 43:35.405
<i>"With love.</i>

43:35.572 --> 43:37.157
<i>Stop. Jo."</i>

44:16.989 --> 44:21.368
Marmee says I'm to stay here
with Aunt Carrol and Florence.

44:21.535 --> 44:25.831
I keep wanting
to tell you to cry.

44:25.998 --> 44:27.666
I can't.

44:31.920 --> 44:35.632
I keep remembering
that will I wrote

44:35.799 --> 44:39.219
when Beth had scarlet fever.

44:39.386 --> 44:41.638
You bequeathed me
a plaster horse,

44:41.805 --> 44:43.265
if I recall correctly.

44:45.100 --> 44:47.394
I had my death...

44:47.561 --> 44:49.771
all rehearsed...

44:49.938 --> 44:51.732
in my mind.

44:51.899 --> 44:54.318
I had Beth's all rehearsed
and ready too.

44:54.484 --> 44:58.530
I thought it would
tear me open;

44:58.697 --> 44:59.907
burn me down,
like a house.

45:00.073 --> 45:01.366
And now...

45:03.660 --> 45:05.704
I'm just frozen.

45:08.498 --> 45:11.251
I'll come to see you
every day, Amy.

45:14.546 --> 45:15.672
Promise me?

45:17.633 --> 45:18.759
Yes.

45:30.479 --> 45:31.772
Marmee thought
that I shouldn't keep this

45:31.939 --> 45:33.065
in my bedroom any more.

45:33.231 --> 45:34.775
I thought to put it
in the parlor,

45:34.942 --> 45:39.321
but it's Beth's
and I don't think

45:39.488 --> 45:41.239
it should be where I can
see it for a while.

45:41.406 --> 45:42.908
It can have a home with me.

45:52.084 --> 45:53.210
Help me.

45:54.670 --> 45:55.796
Always.

45:59.508 --> 46:01.843
You have to write, Jo.

46:03.637 --> 46:04.763
You have to write.

46:09.142 --> 46:12.396
Sift down through your heart,

46:12.562 --> 46:16.316
through all the pain,

46:16.483 --> 46:18.735
and grief.

46:18.902 --> 46:20.028
There are words there.

46:24.783 --> 46:27.411
There's a woman there.

46:29.621 --> 46:31.331
And it's you.

46:31.498 --> 46:35.127
But I don't know
what the words are.

46:35.293 --> 46:36.920
I don't know what to say.

46:37.087 --> 46:39.047
Say you were happy once.

46:42.175 --> 46:43.885
Say there was laughter.

46:46.638 --> 46:50.058
Say what is true.

47:19.838 --> 47:21.882
"My Beth."

47:29.306 --> 47:32.267
<i>"Sitting patient in the shadow.</i>

47:32.434 --> 47:37.230
<i>"Till the blessed life
shall come...</i>

47:37.397 --> 47:40.484
<i>"A serene and saintly presence</i>

47:40.650 --> 47:42.569
<i>"Sanctifies
our troubled home...</i>

47:42.736 --> 47:45.030
Whoa!

47:45.197 --> 47:48.909
<i>"O my sister passing from me</i>

47:49.075 --> 47:53.663
<i>"Out of human care and strife.</i>

47:56.333 --> 47:59.002
<i>"Leave me,
as a gift those virtues</i>

47:59.169 --> 48:01.922
<i>Which have beautified
your life."</i>

48:07.177 --> 48:08.887
"By Josephine March."

48:25.111 --> 48:27.113
Thank you, miss.

48:38.583 --> 48:40.335
Jo!
Don't let the babies in!

48:40.502 --> 48:42.379
They won't get a Christmas
surprise if you do.

48:42.546 --> 48:44.923
They're with Marmee and Hannah
in the kitchen.

48:49.135 --> 48:52.222
Father showed me your poem,
in <i>Godey's</i> magazine.

48:52.389 --> 48:54.432
It's beautiful, Jo.

48:54.599 --> 48:56.518
The editor ordered
four stories,

48:56.685 --> 49:00.146
and as much verse
as I care to write.

49:00.313 --> 49:02.482
He said that he liked them
because they were pure,

49:02.649 --> 49:04.526
warm, and honest.

49:05.986 --> 49:07.696
Cut it out,

49:07.863 --> 49:09.322
and pin it to the wall
above your desk

49:09.489 --> 49:12.492
so you can see what you can do.

49:14.286 --> 49:16.204
I <i>just</i> broke my scissors.

50:03.585 --> 50:06.755
I've had to do yours
all over again.

50:06.922 --> 50:09.090
It will never sail anywhere,
folded like this.

50:09.257 --> 50:12.344
Laurie, that paper boat
could sail across oceans.

50:12.510 --> 50:15.347
It could sail
all the way back home.

50:16.765 --> 50:18.558
Get back on the bank, Amy.

50:18.725 --> 50:20.143
I've saved you from drowning

50:20.310 --> 50:23.438
once before,
I'm not doing do it again.

50:23.605 --> 50:25.231
Okay! Give me yours now!

50:47.545 --> 50:48.672
Oh, they're not
going anywhere.

50:51.633 --> 50:53.051
I'm not sure I want them to.

50:55.095 --> 50:57.180
I quite like them just
sitting there,

50:57.347 --> 50:59.557
side by side.

50:59.724 --> 51:01.518
On the same journey?

51:06.272 --> 51:10.652
We're on the same journey,
aren't we, Amy?

51:10.819 --> 51:11.945
Yes.

51:16.533 --> 51:18.910
Can we make it last forever?

51:47.188 --> 51:49.566
Amy's engaged to be married?

51:51.651 --> 51:52.819
To Laurie?

51:52.986 --> 51:54.487
Yes.

51:55.947 --> 51:58.033
He's been writing me all winter.

51:58.199 --> 52:00.994
Were you hoping
that he would ask you again?

52:02.037 --> 52:03.163
No.

52:05.415 --> 52:07.042
I was hoping he wouldn't.

52:08.585 --> 52:11.921
Because if he had,
I might have said yes.

52:12.088 --> 52:13.298
And not for the right reasons.

52:16.009 --> 52:17.135
I've got writing to do.

52:37.614 --> 52:39.741
That's lovely, Daisy.

52:39.908 --> 52:41.284
Amy will like
the blue pitcher best.

52:41.451 --> 52:43.286
Blue is her
favorite color.

52:43.453 --> 52:44.579
Oh...

52:45.789 --> 52:46.873
Look!

52:47.040 --> 52:48.541
That's lovely!

52:48.708 --> 52:49.793
If they haven't
arrived already,

52:49.959 --> 52:51.544
and early,

52:51.711 --> 52:53.338
and if the little lady
isn't dressed in silk

52:53.505 --> 52:54.672
from her head

52:54.839 --> 52:56.424
to her
French-buttoned boots!

52:58.301 --> 53:00.470
Shall we go see her?
Come on!

53:00.637 --> 53:01.971
Come on!

53:04.557 --> 53:05.975
Amy!

53:06.142 --> 53:07.268
Sweetheart!
Marmee!

53:09.354 --> 53:10.522
Welcome home!

53:10.688 --> 53:12.857
Thank you, sir.
Good to see you.

53:17.403 --> 53:19.864
That's not
an engagement ring!

53:20.031 --> 53:22.909
She has a sapphire from Chopard
as big as a pigeon's egg!

53:23.076 --> 53:25.036
But I can't get
my glove on over it.

53:26.871 --> 53:29.833
It's a wedding ring!

53:33.002 --> 53:34.712
Well done!
Thank you, sir!

53:34.879 --> 53:36.631
Well done!

53:47.016 --> 53:49.018
Hey, Jo!
Is genius burning?

53:49.185 --> 53:51.354
Or can you tolerate a visit?

53:51.521 --> 53:53.690
I can always tolerate
a visit from you, Teddy.

53:53.857 --> 53:57.902
But I'm not sure how many
more surprises I can bear.

54:05.743 --> 54:08.246
Why didn't you tell anyone,
Teddy?

54:11.457 --> 54:13.001
We thought it would be a lark.

54:19.174 --> 54:21.509
I have to get back
to my wife soon.

54:23.928 --> 54:26.973
But I want to say
one thing, once,

54:27.140 --> 54:30.518
and then put it by forever.

54:30.685 --> 54:33.813
And... what is that, Teddy?

54:37.025 --> 54:39.903
I used every power
in my possession

54:40.069 --> 54:41.738
to stop myself
from loving you.

54:43.156 --> 54:44.782
And now I know I never shall.

54:46.576 --> 54:49.829
I will love you
till the day I die, Jo.

54:52.832 --> 54:57.629
But you and Amy have
changed places in my heart.

54:57.795 --> 55:01.549
You are my sister,
and she is...

55:01.716 --> 55:02.842
Mrs. Laurence?

55:04.302 --> 55:05.428
Yes.

55:07.013 --> 55:08.306
Can you believe it?

55:08.473 --> 55:10.225
Yes.

55:12.644 --> 55:13.728
Now can we go back

55:13.895 --> 55:16.314
to being happy,
like we were before?

55:18.274 --> 55:20.693
Not quite.

55:20.860 --> 55:24.656
We were children before,
and we aren't any longer.

55:43.383 --> 55:44.842
Marmee will be along soon.

55:45.009 --> 55:47.929
She just wanted to be sure
that you had seen the doctor.

55:49.806 --> 55:53.309
Estelle sent for him
this morning.

55:53.476 --> 55:55.603
He told me

55:55.770 --> 55:58.648
only what I knew already.

55:58.815 --> 56:01.109
Which is that
you've had a stroke.

56:02.610 --> 56:04.362
A small stroke.

56:04.529 --> 56:07.323
I am in no danger.

56:08.992 --> 56:11.369
I want you to take
some of this soup.

56:13.746 --> 56:16.874
Ordering your elders
and fiddling with the sick.

56:17.041 --> 56:19.585
You've turned into
an old maid, Josephine.

56:21.254 --> 56:23.423
I prefer to think of myself
as a literary spinster.

56:25.300 --> 56:27.135
We're both aunts.

56:28.928 --> 56:30.930
There's a pleasure in it,

56:31.097 --> 56:33.099
as well as duty,

56:33.266 --> 56:36.602
and vexation.

56:36.769 --> 56:40.440
The world should be kinder
to those of us.

56:42.483 --> 56:45.820
Our lives are
not without purpose.

56:45.987 --> 56:48.948
But mine is small,
Aunt March.

56:49.115 --> 56:51.117
It's so small,
and so narrow,

56:51.284 --> 56:54.787
I feel it closing in on me
like walls.

56:54.954 --> 56:57.498
I wasn't meant
for a life like this.

57:00.835 --> 57:02.503
Now...

57:04.339 --> 57:05.423
Open up.

57:05.590 --> 57:07.300
When I'm... when I'm ready.

57:10.428 --> 57:14.223
Better times will come.

57:36.996 --> 57:37.914
Professor Bhaer?

57:38.081 --> 57:39.374
Is that you?

57:41.417 --> 57:42.543
Miss March!

57:46.714 --> 57:50.676
You look tired.

57:50.843 --> 57:52.553
I've been to see my aunt.

57:52.720 --> 57:53.888
She's sick.

57:58.559 --> 58:01.479
What in heaven's name
has brought you here?

58:02.647 --> 58:03.773
Business.

58:06.150 --> 58:07.944
Please, take shelter.

58:14.325 --> 58:16.702
You said you'd come back.

58:18.621 --> 58:21.541
I promised Beth I'd stay.

58:24.961 --> 58:26.087
I shouldn't have
stopped writing.

58:28.673 --> 58:30.133
You didn't.

58:30.299 --> 58:32.844
You wrote a poem.

58:33.010 --> 58:34.512
It was called "My Beth."

58:34.679 --> 58:36.139
You saw it?

58:38.433 --> 58:39.892
And I keep it

58:40.059 --> 58:42.437
against my heart...

58:45.064 --> 58:47.608
which has been sore for you.

58:54.449 --> 58:56.993
I should go...

58:57.160 --> 58:59.454
You must entertain visitors,
perhaps?

58:59.620 --> 59:01.706
No.
It's just my family.

59:02.623 --> 59:05.293
But don't worry,

59:05.460 --> 59:06.752
I've told them
so much about you.

59:06.919 --> 59:08.963
Oh, you have?

59:18.723 --> 59:20.558
Come here.

59:20.725 --> 59:23.436
I've forgotten how to do it
the pretty way.

59:27.064 --> 59:29.066
You don't have to, Jo.

59:29.233 --> 59:30.985
You look beautiful.

59:32.445 --> 59:35.114
Everybody really likes him.

59:44.081 --> 59:46.751
Hurry up, Jo... it's your turn,
and your audience

59:46.918 --> 59:49.337
is getting restless.

1:00:22.870 --> 1:00:24.789
Thank you!

1:00:24.956 --> 1:00:26.499
She is looking a little
stronger, Amy.

1:00:26.666 --> 1:00:28.668
I'm sure of it.

1:00:28.834 --> 1:00:29.919
Yeah.

1:00:30.086 --> 1:00:31.796
Boys!

1:00:31.963 --> 1:00:33.631
Boys!
Lay off the apple picking
for now,

1:00:33.798 --> 1:00:35.258
and come get your tea.

1:00:35.424 --> 1:00:36.509
Class One over there,

1:00:36.676 --> 1:00:38.594
Class Two there,
where I can see you!

1:00:38.761 --> 1:00:41.597
I never imagined Aunt March
would leave Plumfield to Jo

1:00:41.764 --> 1:00:43.391
in her will.

1:00:43.558 --> 1:00:45.560
And I daresay,
Aunt March never imagined

1:00:45.726 --> 1:00:47.270
what she'd do with it.

1:00:49.146 --> 1:00:50.439
I don't think that old house

1:00:50.606 --> 1:00:52.441
ever made her happy.

1:00:52.608 --> 1:00:54.318
But it's brought me more joy
than any castle in the air,

1:00:54.485 --> 1:00:57.363
even if my hair
is turning grey.

1:00:57.530 --> 1:01:00.157
Nothing is ever perfect.

1:01:01.534 --> 1:01:03.327
But things can be just right.

1:01:04.829 --> 1:01:06.289
Yes, they can.
