00:01.669 --> 00:05.637
[♪♪♪]

00:08.142 --> 00:09.675
Good afternoon, ladies
and gentlemen of the board.

00:09.710 --> 00:11.577
If there's no questions,
let's begin.

00:13.347 --> 00:14.947
We start...

00:14.982 --> 00:16.949
here...

00:18.452 --> 00:19.485
and end here,

00:19.520 --> 00:22.955
at one of the most lavish
and spectacular resorts

00:22.990 --> 00:24.423
in all of North America--

00:24.458 --> 00:26.592
a retreat
where the overstressed

00:26.627 --> 00:29.361
can relax, refresh,
and recharge,

00:29.397 --> 00:32.364
and America's premier resort
from The Belmont Corporation,

00:32.400 --> 00:34.333
and our new partners,
Global Enterprises.

00:34.368 --> 00:37.436
And we have found a ranch
just outside Bighorn, Montana

00:37.471 --> 00:39.638
that we feel is ideally suited
to this latest venture--

00:39.673 --> 00:41.840
a beautiful, 2,500-acre spread,

00:41.876 --> 00:43.475
with some of
the most spectacular views

00:43.511 --> 00:44.343
you'll ever see.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.178
Now, I fly to Montana
in the morning

00:46.213 --> 00:48.480
to convince the owners
to sell to us,

00:48.516 --> 00:50.983
so let's hope that I don't leave
my powers of persuasion behind.

00:51.018 --> 00:52.451
[all chuckling]

00:52.486 --> 00:53.952
Ashley? Todd?

00:53.988 --> 00:55.020
Anything to add?

00:55.056 --> 00:56.722
Uh, well, the good news is,

00:56.757 --> 00:59.124
the property
is three months in arrears,

00:59.160 --> 01:01.960
so we think the owner
will be ripe to make a deal.

01:01.996 --> 01:03.462
Once the deal is closed,

01:03.497 --> 01:04.563
we hope to break ground
immediately

01:04.598 --> 01:07.666
with a projected completion
time frame of 34 months.

01:07.701 --> 01:10.669
Now, this is the first,
but hopefully not the last,

01:10.704 --> 01:12.404
Belmont/Global joint venture--

01:12.440 --> 01:13.972
so we're all determined
to do this right.

01:14.008 --> 01:14.973
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:15.009 --> 01:16.809
I thank you for your time
and your attention,

01:16.844 --> 01:18.544
but that's enough shop talk,
let's go home.

01:18.579 --> 01:21.146
[applauding]

01:22.950 --> 01:24.516
So what's the latest
on the owner?

01:24.552 --> 01:25.451
Walker?

01:25.486 --> 01:27.086
Sam Walker.
Everything's under control.

01:27.121 --> 01:28.587
I spoke
to the foreman yesterday.

01:28.622 --> 01:29.988
They're expecting you tomorrow.

01:30.024 --> 01:31.090
Good.

01:31.125 --> 01:31.990
They're under pressure
and we're the white knight.

01:32.026 --> 01:33.725
Hopefully, they'll just
take our money

01:33.761 --> 01:35.160
and leave us the key
to the ranch.

01:35.196 --> 01:37.329
That's the plan.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.902
[♪♪♪]

02:08.462 --> 02:10.295
Check out my poster!

02:10.331 --> 02:11.864
Oh, it's so pretty.

02:11.899 --> 02:12.898
Thank you.

02:12.933 --> 02:15.067
You're really good.

02:16.437 --> 02:18.036
How's it coming?

02:18.072 --> 02:20.639
My little artist.

02:20.674 --> 02:23.041
-Wow.
-Good job, Annie-girl!

02:23.077 --> 02:25.577
I think
it's your best poster yet.

02:25.613 --> 02:26.979
And your last one for a while.
You've got chores.

02:27.014 --> 02:29.414
Aw, Mom. Five more minutes?

02:29.450 --> 02:31.216
I'm sorry. Say so long.

02:31.252 --> 02:33.585
Okay. So long, guys.

02:33.621 --> 02:34.753
Good luck with your posters.

02:34.788 --> 02:35.787
Thanks very much.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.089
Thank you.

02:37.124 --> 02:38.757
[chuckles]

02:44.298 --> 02:45.998
So...

02:46.033 --> 02:47.466
I met with Hal at the bank.

02:47.501 --> 02:50.002
How'd it go?

02:50.037 --> 02:52.137
Hal and your father
go way back.

02:52.173 --> 02:53.972
All the way back
to grade school.

02:54.008 --> 02:55.240
So, trust me,

02:55.276 --> 02:57.409
he'll leave no stone unturned
when it comes to helping out.

02:57.444 --> 02:59.978
You don't
have to worry about that.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.148
We've got coloring to do.

03:04.285 --> 03:06.451
Yes, ma'am.

03:11.058 --> 03:12.624
[Richard] This project
is the primary reason

03:12.660 --> 03:14.092
Global wants to merge with us,

03:14.128 --> 03:15.160
and we need everything
to move quickly,

03:15.196 --> 03:16.628
which is my job.

03:16.664 --> 03:17.996
Your job is to make sure

03:18.032 --> 03:19.331
that everything
flows smoothly here

03:19.366 --> 03:20.666
until I get back.

03:20.701 --> 03:21.633
Think you two can handle that?

03:21.669 --> 03:22.601
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

03:22.636 --> 03:23.635
Good.

03:23.671 --> 03:24.636
And Richard--

03:24.672 --> 03:25.537
good luck.

03:25.573 --> 03:26.972
I don't believe in luck.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.140
I believe in negotiations.

03:28.175 --> 03:29.775
I've gotta go.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.109
I will be in touch
with you later.

03:35.182 --> 03:37.216
Ah-hah!

03:37.251 --> 03:38.984
-Good evening, Mr. Belmont.
-Good evening.

03:39.019 --> 03:40.385
What's the score?

03:40.421 --> 03:42.221
We're up two to one
in the sixth, sir.

03:42.256 --> 03:43.655
All right. All right.
Who's on the mound?

03:43.691 --> 03:44.623
[emphatically] Tanaka.

03:44.658 --> 03:45.490
Tanaka?

03:45.526 --> 03:46.992
He's pitching
a one-hitter tonight.

03:47.027 --> 03:48.126
Sounds good.

03:48.162 --> 03:50.529
Oh... that reminds me.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.731
For you and your daughter.

03:52.766 --> 03:53.999
I won't be needing them
tomorrow night.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.167
Are you kidding me?

03:55.202 --> 03:57.002
Box seats!

03:57.037 --> 03:58.403
Thank you so much, sir.

03:58.439 --> 04:00.239
You're a real stand-up guy.

04:00.274 --> 04:01.873
You deserve it.
Tell Sasha I said hello.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.075
I sure will.

04:03.110 --> 04:04.276

08:56.169 --> 08:57.536
You know Sam Walker?

08:57.571 --> 08:58.970
Maybe you could
tell me about him.

08:59.006 --> 09:00.038
Oh, boy.

09:00.073 --> 09:02.874
Well, I know Sam, all right.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.309
I'll take it from here, Willie.

09:04.344 --> 09:05.844
-We'll be right back.
-Uh, but he's my ride.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.312
Go easy on him, Sam.

09:07.347 --> 09:09.347
Wait, wait, wait.

09:09.383 --> 09:10.949
You're Sam Walker?

09:10.984 --> 09:12.851
The<i> </i> Sam Walker?

09:12.886 --> 09:16.688
Technically, it's Samantha,
but everyone calls me Sam.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.557
And what about you?

09:18.592 --> 09:20.959
Just Richard?
There's no nickname?

09:20.994 --> 09:22.994
Ricardo? Richie?

09:23.030 --> 09:24.095
Rick?

09:25.399 --> 09:26.398
Just Richard.

09:26.433 --> 09:28.867
Not sure I can trust a man
without a nickname.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.002
Anyway,
you came to see the ranch,

09:31.038 --> 09:33.204
so why don't I give you
a bird's-eye view?

09:36.743 --> 09:38.910
You're supposed to follow me,
"Just Richard."

09:38.946 --> 09:40.612
Oh. Right.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.182
You're a developer, right?

09:44.217 --> 09:45.684
[Richard] That's right.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.719
Bet you want to build
a big resort.

09:47.754 --> 09:50.055
Maybe a championship
golf course,

09:50.090 --> 09:52.223
a lake with sailboats
and canoes.

09:53.694 --> 09:56.394
Well, actually, I pictured
two championship golf courses

09:56.430 --> 09:58.463
and a shopping mall
in between 'em.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.167
Just so you know,

10:02.202 --> 10:03.868
I'm open to hearing your offer,

10:03.904 --> 10:06.738
but I have every intention
of keeping the ranch.

10:08.241 --> 10:10.442
Well, our development would
bring commerce to the region,

10:10.477 --> 10:11.943
keep the shops open
and thriving,

10:11.979 --> 10:14.212
pave the way
for new small businesses.

10:14.247 --> 10:15.380
And our offer's very generous,

10:15.415 --> 10:18.383
with a bonus built in for
early departure of the property.

10:18.418 --> 10:19.417
Are you kidding me?

10:19.453 --> 10:20.318
We just met,

10:20.354 --> 10:21.786
and you're already
showing me the door.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.054
I just...

10:34.835 --> 10:36.935
Allow me to present my offer.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.037
Shh. Shh, shh.

10:40.107 --> 10:41.072
Just listen.

10:46.079 --> 10:48.013
Close your eyes.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.154
What am I supposed to hear?

10:56.189 --> 10:58.590
The sound of silence.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.893
[cell phone rings]

11:03.163 --> 11:04.562
Oh, great.
Now I've got a signal.

11:04.598 --> 11:05.664
Sorry. I've got to take this.

11:05.699 --> 11:07.098
Mm.

11:07.134 --> 11:09.367
Todd. Hey. I'm with Walker now.

11:10.537 --> 11:12.737
I'm looking at the ranch.
It's beautiful.

11:15.042 --> 11:16.775
I'll call you
when I get settled.

11:17.878 --> 11:19.878
Sam!

11:22.949 --> 11:24.416
Thanks, Willie.

11:24.451 --> 11:25.917
Not a problem.

11:25.952 --> 11:29.120
Think I got to throw
these shoes out.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.323
No. Just a little spit
and an old rag,

11:32.359 --> 11:33.358
and they'll shine up fine.

11:33.393 --> 11:35.627
Right.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.564
Hey, can I call you later,
when I get a place to stay?

11:40.867 --> 11:42.967
You don't have
a place to stay?

11:43.003 --> 11:47.038
Well, no, according to my ride,
everything's booked up.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.273
-The, uh...
-Festival. Right.

11:49.743 --> 11:50.775
Sounds like
you're in a pickle.

11:54.681 --> 11:56.815
[sighs]

11:56.850 --> 11:59.851
We have a guest cottage
at the ranch.

11:59.886 --> 12:03.455
It's not the Ritz-Carlton,
but you can stay if you like.

12:03.490 --> 12:04.989
You're offering to let me
stay at the ranch?

12:05.025 --> 12:06.524
That's how
we do things here.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.625
If a person's stuck,

12:07.661 --> 12:08.860
they always have
a place to stay.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.628
Besides...

12:10.664 --> 12:12.330
it's the least I can do
after ruining your shoes.

12:14.201 --> 12:15.500
Well, thank you.

12:15.535 --> 12:16.901
That's very kind.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.670
You do know
that's not gonna stop me

12:18.705 --> 12:20.705
from trying to convince you
to sell me your ranch, right?

12:20.741 --> 12:22.741
Oh, that's why
I want you there.

12:22.776 --> 12:24.142
So I can keep an eye on ya.

12:29.716 --> 12:30.849
Okay then.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.183
Let's go, JR.

12:32.219 --> 12:34.052
"JR"?

12:34.087 --> 12:36.054
That's short for
"Just Richard."

12:36.089 --> 12:38.690
There. Now you got a nickname.

12:38.725 --> 12:39.858
Tch.

12:41.695 --> 12:44.062
[hooves clopping]

12:44.097 --> 12:45.897
Get in, JR.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.665
[Willie laughs]

12:51.404 --> 12:53.271
[Catherine] I love this ranch.

12:53.306 --> 12:56.608
She'll do what's best.

12:56.643 --> 12:59.077
If there's one thing that
I know about Sam Walker,

12:59.112 --> 13:00.879
it's her unparalleled drive
to do what's right.

13:00.914 --> 13:01.880
Mm.

13:07.821 --> 13:08.720
-Speak of the devil.
-Oh!

13:17.297 --> 13:18.963
Well, hello there.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.732
[Sam] Buck, Catherine.

13:20.767 --> 13:23.701
This is Richard Belmont
from New York.

13:23.737 --> 13:26.371
-Mm.
-But you can call him JR.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.307
-Okay.
-Nice to meet you. Richard.

13:29.342 --> 13:30.742
Nice to meet you, Richard.

13:30.777 --> 13:32.911
Welcome to Walker Ranch.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.245
Our daughter's
around here somewhere.

13:34.281 --> 13:36.247
Annie!

13:37.584 --> 13:38.783
Coming!

13:38.819 --> 13:39.551
-There she is.
-There she is.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.889
-Annie, this is JR.
-Hi, Annie.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.225
You all live here?

13:47.260 --> 13:49.494
Yep. Home, sweet home.

13:49.529 --> 13:50.895
Buck and Catherine
keep the place running,

13:50.931 --> 13:53.298
and I would be lost
without them.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.433
Anyway, let me
show you to your digs.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.769
I'll take that.

13:57.804 --> 13:59.103
-Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

14:00.874 --> 14:02.307
Stays pretty quiet out here
at night,

14:02.342 --> 14:04.409
just some wolves and coyotes.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.311
Wolves and coyotes?

14:06.346 --> 14:08.146
Don't worry.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.914
Simba will scare them off.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.349
And who is Simba?

14:11.384 --> 14:13.151
Oh, our resident mountain lion.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.319
[apprehensive chuckle]

14:14.354 --> 14:15.820
You have
a resident mountain lion?

14:15.856 --> 14:18.323
[laughs] Relax.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.958
He'll probably leave you alone.

14:19.993 --> 14:21.926
"Probably?"

14:31.538 --> 14:33.238
So this is you.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.941
Will there be
turndown service?

14:36.977 --> 14:38.176
And chocolates on the pillows?

14:38.211 --> 14:40.311
Yeah, the housekeeper's
on vacation,

14:40.347 --> 14:41.946
so you'll have to clean up
after yourself.

14:41.982 --> 14:42.814
Oh, I'm very clean.

14:42.849 --> 14:43.882
I'm sure you are.

14:43.917 --> 14:47.685
So the cottage is small,
but cozy.

14:47.721 --> 14:50.121
You've got a fridge, microwave,

14:50.156 --> 14:52.223
no TV, no phone.

14:52.259 --> 14:54.325
Everything you need,
and nothin' you don't.

14:54.361 --> 14:55.760
Oh, uh...

14:56.763 --> 14:58.062
Where do I get signal?

14:58.098 --> 15:00.131
Phone service
is a bit spotty out here.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.000
Best place
is behind the barn.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.501
Okay, perfect. Thanks.

15:03.536 --> 15:05.003
Mm-hmm.

15:05.038 --> 15:05.970
Oh, uh, Sam?

15:07.407 --> 15:08.673
How is delivery around here?

15:08.708 --> 15:09.674
Delivery?

15:11.611 --> 15:13.478
Are you talking foals,
calves, or babies?

15:13.513 --> 15:15.580
Food. [chuckles]

15:15.615 --> 15:17.649
I don't want to inconvenience
your chef.

15:18.852 --> 15:21.085
Supper's served at 6:00.

15:21.121 --> 15:24.455
I'll alert the "chef"
that you'll be joining us.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.327
Oh, Sam?

15:29.362 --> 15:31.062
Don't I need a key?

15:31.097 --> 15:32.730
Nobody locks their doors
around here.

15:50.784 --> 15:52.917
[bell clanging]

15:58.491 --> 16:01.859
Oh, hey, JR.
Come on in.

16:01.895 --> 16:05.096
Oh... Oh! Uh...

16:05.131 --> 16:06.898
["JR" chuckles]

16:06.933 --> 16:09.233
Didn't realize we didn't
dress for dinner. Sorry.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.536
Wow. Carbs.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.237
[JR chuckling]

16:13.273 --> 16:16.040
Well, country life means
working hard in the day

16:16.076 --> 16:18.543
and celebrating good food
in the evening.

16:18.578 --> 16:21.245
Thanks.

16:21.281 --> 16:23.381
So, Sam, since the airport's
gonna be closed for a few days,

16:23.416 --> 16:25.283
maybe you'd like
to take Richard shopping.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.284
That would be great, actually.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.819
I have to pick up
a couple of personal items.

16:27.854 --> 16:29.587
I only packed for one night.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.559
Mm.

16:34.594 --> 16:37.161
That is delicious.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.964
I haven't had a home-cooked meal
like this in...

16:40.000 --> 16:40.965
Actually, I don't think

16:41.001 --> 16:42.400
I've ever had
a home-cooked meal like this.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.635
Catherine,
you've outdone yourself.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.170
Oh! Well, there's plenty,

16:46.206 --> 16:50.174
as you can see,
but Sam did the cooking tonight.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.943
Thank you.

16:51.978 --> 16:53.945
From the chef.

16:53.980 --> 16:55.146
Mm. Mm-hmm.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.614
[Annie] JR?

16:56.649 --> 16:58.416
Mom says you do business?

16:58.451 --> 16:59.417
That's right.

16:59.452 --> 17:01.085
I'm planning to start
my own business someday.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.787
Oh, yeah? What kind?

17:02.822 --> 17:03.821
[Annie] I don't know.

17:03.857 --> 17:05.823
As long as it's with horses.

17:05.859 --> 17:07.325
I love horses.

17:07.360 --> 17:08.426
Maybe you can help me.

17:09.696 --> 17:12.030
Well, yeah.
I'd love to.

17:12.065 --> 17:13.698
Why don't we have
your people get in touch

17:13.733 --> 17:15.299
with my people,
and we'll set a meeting.

17:15.335 --> 17:17.335
Okay.

17:17.370 --> 17:19.537
Who are my people?

17:19.572 --> 17:20.805
[laughs]

17:20.840 --> 17:22.473
We are, honey.

17:22.509 --> 17:23.674
[adults laughing]

17:26.679 --> 17:28.212
So, Richard.

17:28.248 --> 17:29.814
Speaking of business--

17:29.849 --> 17:31.182
Sam tells us you'd like
to buy the ranch.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.583
[Sam coughs]

17:34.087 --> 17:35.820
Uh, well...

17:35.855 --> 17:38.189
my company does have plans
to invest in Bighorn's future,

17:38.224 --> 17:40.058
and your ranch is a big piece
of that puzzle.

17:40.093 --> 17:42.660
I told JR I would
listen to his offer,

17:42.695 --> 17:45.329
but that we have every intention
of keeping our ranch.

17:45.365 --> 17:46.297
Mm.

17:46.332 --> 17:47.131
Sam's got this idea
she's kicking around.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.699
Hush. I'm keeping it
under my hat.

17:50.036 --> 17:51.002
Okay.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.805
I see.

17:56.843 --> 17:58.376
Well, we're delighted
to have you, Richard,

17:58.411 --> 17:59.343
whatever the reason.

17:59.379 --> 18:00.378
Thank you.

18:00.413 --> 18:01.312
Of course, while you're here,

18:01.347 --> 18:02.647
you will have to follow
the house rule.

18:02.682 --> 18:04.182
What house rule?

18:04.217 --> 18:05.850
Well, we don't tolerate
freeloaders at Walker Ranch,

18:05.885 --> 18:08.186
so JR will have to pull
his own weight.

18:08.221 --> 18:09.887
That sounds fair.

18:09.923 --> 18:12.190
Great.
You'll do the dishes tonight.

18:12.225 --> 18:13.858
Ha. Nice!

18:13.893 --> 18:14.859
[all chuckling]

18:14.894 --> 18:17.562
[♪♪♪]

18:26.039 --> 18:27.338
Want some food?

18:27.373 --> 18:29.040
There you go.

18:29.075 --> 18:30.575
It tickles.

18:31.878 --> 18:32.877
You wanna try?

18:34.114 --> 18:35.446
Uh, no. I'm good here.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.081
Oh.

18:37.117 --> 18:38.716
He probably won't bite.

18:38.751 --> 18:39.717
Oh, good. "Probably."

18:39.752 --> 18:42.587
I think it tickles.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.288
Come on.
Give me your hand.

18:44.324 --> 18:45.690
Uh...

18:45.725 --> 18:47.758
[laughs] Just relax.

18:47.794 --> 18:48.926
All right, all right.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.595
-Okay. Okay.
-Now make it flat.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.133
[Sam laughs]

18:55.168 --> 18:57.368
[horse slurping and crunching]

18:57.403 --> 18:58.803
There you go.

18:58.838 --> 18:59.971
[Catherine]
Annie! Time for bed!

19:00.006 --> 19:01.072
Coming, Mom!

19:01.107 --> 19:04.108
'Night, Sam.
'Night, Dad.

19:04.144 --> 19:05.109
Okay, be there in a second

19:05.145 --> 19:06.711
to give you a kiss goodnight,
okay, Junebug?

19:06.746 --> 19:08.312
Don't forget to show JR
the lightning bugs!

19:08.348 --> 19:10.548
I won't.
Sweet dreams, Annie-girl.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.216
Goodnight, JR!

19:12.252 --> 19:13.184
'Night, Annie.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.787
Well...
I best be following.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.257
Lightning bugs, huh?
It's about time.

19:19.292 --> 19:20.791
Lightning bugs?

19:20.827 --> 19:22.326
You've never heard
of lightning bugs?

19:22.362 --> 19:23.995
Well, I-I've heard of them.

19:24.030 --> 19:25.963
I've just never
seen them in person.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.066
You do a good job
feeding the horse,

19:29.102 --> 19:31.068
I'll show you
the lightning bugs.

19:31.104 --> 19:32.537
Deal.

19:38.311 --> 19:40.478
Hey, uh, hey...

19:42.715 --> 19:44.782
All right.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.951
You're not gonna eat me, right?

19:51.324 --> 19:53.257
That's not so bad.

19:53.293 --> 19:55.660
[munching]

19:55.695 --> 19:59.063
Hey! I got this.

20:04.037 --> 20:06.270
So how long's the ranch
been in your family?

20:06.306 --> 20:08.272
[Sam] Four generations.

20:08.308 --> 20:13.411
Dad should've sold it,
but he's stubborn.

20:13.446 --> 20:15.947
And he loved this land.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.216
The ranch was his life.

20:18.251 --> 20:20.051
When he died,

20:20.086 --> 20:21.686
the remaining 2,500 acres,

20:21.721 --> 20:23.888
and the mountain of debt
that came with them,

20:23.923 --> 20:27.091
passed on to me.

20:27.126 --> 20:28.226
According to Dad,

20:28.261 --> 20:30.728
the land was important,
but the code was paramount.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.096
The code?

20:32.131 --> 20:33.364
"The Cowboy Code."

20:33.399 --> 20:35.399
I didn't know
there was such a thing.

20:35.435 --> 20:36.601
Oh, yes.

In the interest of
living each day with courage...

21:07.767 --> 21:08.933
there's our offer.

21:08.968 --> 21:12.103

There must be thousands of 'em.

21:49.642 --> 21:52.476
I've never seen
anything like it.

21:52.512 --> 21:54.779
I'm surprised
you've never seen them before.

21:54.814 --> 21:57.181
They're a lot more common
in your part of the country.

21:58.484 --> 22:00.484
Maybe they're afraid
to come into the city.

22:00.520 --> 22:01.686
Too much traffic.

22:01.721 --> 22:04.388
They're rare here...

22:04.424 --> 22:06.957

all the more special.

a lot of things around here

30:56.355 --> 30:58.322
and they always say
they can ride...

30:58.357 --> 31:01.925
until they get in the saddle
and start sliding out of it.

31:01.961 --> 31:03.293
[all chuckling]

31:03.329 --> 31:05.395
You want to show him
how it's done, Annie-girl?

31:05.431 --> 31:06.997
All right.

31:07.032 --> 31:09.566
Now you stand beside your mount,
like this.

31:09.602 --> 31:11.802
Put both reins
in your left hand,

31:11.837 --> 31:13.003
with a little tuft of mane.

31:13.038 --> 31:14.605
Keep the right rein tight,

31:14.640 --> 31:16.840
so he doesn't swing away
when you get on.

31:16.876 --> 31:18.308
Turn the stirrup
so the fender lies flat,

31:18.344 --> 31:19.509
lift your left foot in

31:19.545 --> 31:21.645
and push up with your right leg.

31:21.680 --> 31:23.580
Lookin' good up there, cow girl.

31:26.318 --> 31:27.651
All right, let's get you down.

31:30.022 --> 31:31.421
See, JR? It's easy.

31:31.457 --> 31:32.322
Now it's your turn.

31:33.959 --> 31:35.626
Oh, yeah.

31:35.661 --> 31:37.928
Okay. All right. My turn.

31:37.963 --> 31:39.296
-Oh, it's-it's...
-Like this...

31:39.331 --> 31:40.797
...The other side.

31:42.001 --> 31:43.867
Right.

31:43.903 --> 31:45.302
Good start.

31:47.206 --> 31:48.572
Okay, reins and...

31:48.607 --> 31:50.073
mane, or something like that,

31:50.109 --> 31:51.575
and left leg lift,
then...

31:51.610 --> 31:54.011
and then we're up.

31:54.046 --> 31:55.545
[grunting intensely]
Uh... yep. Okay.

31:55.581 --> 31:56.680
All right. We're up.

31:56.715 --> 31:57.848
Okay.

31:57.883 --> 32:00.384
Okay. Okay, all right...

32:00.419 --> 32:01.685
Ahh...

32:01.720 --> 32:03.353
[exhales deeply]

32:03.389 --> 32:06.189
-Not bad!
-Hey.

32:06.225 --> 32:07.691
This feels pretty good
up here, actually.

32:09.428 --> 32:10.527
You ready?

32:10.562 --> 32:12.195
Ready.

32:12.231 --> 32:13.563
Go easy on JR.

32:13.599 --> 32:14.765
He's new.

32:14.800 --> 32:16.300
And we like him.

32:16.335 --> 32:18.101
So none of that throwing stuff.

32:19.305 --> 32:21.071
Wait. Thro--
"Throwing stuff"?

32:21.106 --> 32:22.773
[laughs]

32:22.808 --> 32:24.541
Come on, city-slicker.

32:24.576 --> 32:25.475
Okay.

32:25.511 --> 32:27.945
[Sam We'll be back
by supper, Annie-girl.

32:27.980 --> 32:29.379
[Annie] Okay, Sam.

32:29.415 --> 32:30.881
Have fun, JR!

32:30.916 --> 32:32.783
Uh-huh. Bye, Annie.

32:35.120 --> 32:38.221
Oh, yeah. He's totally gonna
slide right out of that saddle.

32:43.128 --> 32:45.262
[JR] Wow, even the air
is different out here.

32:46.865 --> 32:48.165
And quiet!

32:48.200 --> 32:50.267
No noise from the city.

32:50.302 --> 32:53.503
What was it like,
growing up where you did?

32:53.539 --> 32:56.173
Well, it had its advantages.

32:56.208 --> 32:57.574
Even went camping
a couple times,

32:57.609 --> 32:58.542
upstate.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.813
Probably pretty tame
to you.

33:02.848 --> 33:05.082
You know,
that horse suits you.

33:05.117 --> 33:06.516
Yeah?

33:06.552 --> 33:08.285
Maybe I was a cowboy
in another life.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.287
Yeah, maybe.

33:25.738 --> 33:27.504
Well, I think I'm okay here.

The water's warm.

You sure about that?

Move it, cowboy.

All right.
I guess I'm going in.

it was gonna be warm!

[Sam laughing]

34:02.508 --> 34:04.674
It's just a figure of speech.

34:04.710 --> 34:07.210
When was the last time
you walked through a stream?

34:07.246 --> 34:08.812
The last time?

34:08.847 --> 34:09.813
Mm-hmm.

34:09.848 --> 34:11.581
I think your idea of warm
and my idea of warm

34:11.617 --> 34:13.650
are very different things.

34:15.254 --> 34:16.319
See?

34:16.355 --> 34:17.354
It's freezing!

34:17.389 --> 34:19.222
I know.

34:20.359 --> 34:21.625

34:30.702 --> 34:32.702
Oh.

34:35.240 --> 34:37.240
I used to come here
all the time for picnics.

34:37.276 --> 34:40.077
It's one of my favorite spots.

34:41.713 --> 34:42.879
I can see why.

34:45.217 --> 34:46.149
What?

34:47.986 --> 34:50.720
I think this country thing
is growing on you.

34:51.890 --> 34:52.823
What makes you say that?

34:53.859 --> 34:56.893
You didn't talk business once
the whole ride.

34:56.929 --> 34:59.029
That's about to change.

34:59.064 --> 35:01.098

35:03.735 --> 35:05.769
Did you take a look
at my offer?

35:06.905 --> 35:08.238
I did.

35:08.273 --> 35:09.372
And?

35:09.408 --> 35:10.907
Still mulling it over.

35:10.943 --> 35:12.542
Any idea when the mulling
might be over?

35:17.149 --> 35:20.117
We had a big storm
last winter.

35:20.152 --> 35:22.219
Did some damage to the barn.

35:23.355 --> 35:25.255
The repairs weren't cheap,

35:25.290 --> 35:27.390
and I...

35:27.426 --> 35:29.593
fell a little behind
on the payments.

35:32.164 --> 35:33.497
I'll make it up,

35:33.532 --> 35:35.932
but the bank
is running out of patience.

35:37.102 --> 35:39.102
That's tough.

35:39.104 --> 35:41.104
Yeah.

35:42.975 --> 35:45.075
You want
some free advice?

35:46.879 --> 35:48.145
Sure.

35:48.180 --> 35:49.613
Toss a coin.

35:54.786 --> 35:56.753
Tails, you don't.

35:56.788 --> 35:57.821
But here's the thing.

35:57.856 --> 35:58.822
You toss the coin,

35:58.857 --> 36:00.157
you catch it in mid-air,

36:00.192 --> 36:01.291
keep it
in the palm of your hand

36:01.326 --> 36:02.259
and don't look at it.

36:02.294 --> 36:03.326
Why's that?

36:03.362 --> 36:05.862
Because you should go
with what you hoped it was

36:05.898 --> 36:07.264
while it was in the air.

36:07.299 --> 36:09.166
That's the only way
to use a coin toss

36:09.201 --> 36:11.234
to make
an important decision.

36:13.172 --> 36:15.172
Well, what if I want it
to land on tails?

36:16.341 --> 36:17.841
Then I go home.

36:17.876 --> 36:19.342
Never darken
your doorstep again.

36:19.378 --> 36:20.944
That a promise?
You won't even visit?

Well, you are a...

36:31.156 --> 36:33.123
pretty great dishwasher,

don't just grow on trees.

36:42.367 --> 36:44.467
So, how'd you come up
with this coin toss theory?

-Hey!

out of my Ivy League education.

you don't know, Mr. Ivy Leaguer.

What's that?

to cook supper tonight.

pulling-your-weight thing?

if you want me cooking.

37:18.804 --> 37:20.003
Don't worry.

You'll have
an excellent sous chef.

37:28.447 --> 37:29.879
Oh... there it goes.

37:29.915 --> 37:31.348
Good job.

37:31.383 --> 37:32.616
[JR] All right.

37:32.651 --> 37:34.551

you pour it back in there.

What do you think? How'd I do?

37:36.588 --> 37:37.721
-Good.
-Yeah?

37:37.756 --> 37:38.722
How's it going in here?

37:38.757 --> 37:40.190
Almost ready.

37:40.225 --> 37:42.359
The sous chef's
putting me through my paces.

37:42.394 --> 37:43.760
I'm a shoe chef?

37:43.795 --> 37:44.928
[adults laughing]

37:44.963 --> 37:47.931
Sure is a lot of spaghetti.

37:47.966 --> 37:49.466
Yeah. I think we maybe made
a little too much.

37:49.501 --> 37:53.870
I think it's time
for a taste test.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.708
Well?

37:58.744 --> 38:00.710
Is it ready?

38:00.746 --> 38:03.380
Yep. I guess we did
a good job, huh, JR?

38:03.415 --> 38:05.649
Good job?
I think we rocked it.

38:05.684 --> 38:07.917
You think we rocked it?
All right, put it there.

38:11.356 --> 38:12.956
Okay! So, what do I do next?

38:12.991 --> 38:14.124
[Annie] You serve it.

38:14.159 --> 38:15.625

show me a card trick.

Hey. It's bedtime, kitten.

38:20.032 --> 38:22.198
Okay.

38:23.602 --> 38:26.336
Okay, I've got the cards.
Can you show me the trick now?

38:26.371 --> 38:27.370
Yeah.

38:31.276 --> 38:33.777
Pick a card.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.478
Place it anywhere in the deck.

38:35.514 --> 38:36.546
Don't show it to me.

38:38.383 --> 38:40.717
Put it back in the deck,
anywhere you want.

38:42.454 --> 38:43.586
Ready.

38:43.622 --> 38:44.587
All right.

38:55.701 --> 38:57.033
Yes! That's amazing!

38:57.069 --> 38:58.768
Sam!

38:58.804 --> 39:00.203
Isn't JR cool?

39:00.238 --> 39:02.706
He's a pilot
and really good at card tricks.

39:02.741 --> 39:03.940
That's great, Annie.

39:05.977 --> 39:06.943
You know, Annie.

39:06.978 --> 39:08.678
I've been thinking about
that company of yours.

39:08.714 --> 39:09.713
[Annie] Yeah?

39:09.748 --> 39:10.914
[JR] I was thinking

39:10.949 --> 39:13.750
that since you like horses
and you like helping people...

39:15.020 --> 39:17.053
Maybe you could use them
as therapy animals.

39:17.089 --> 39:20.323
Bring 'em to kids
in children's hospitals

39:20.359 --> 39:22.225
or old folks
in nursing homes.

39:22.260 --> 39:24.060
Cheer 'em up when they're
going through hard times.

39:24.096 --> 39:25.829
Everybody loves
horses, right?

39:25.864 --> 39:27.897
I like that idea.

39:27.933 --> 39:28.665
I know!

39:28.700 --> 39:31.201
We could call it
"Healing Horses."

39:31.236 --> 39:33.203
There you have it.

39:33.238 --> 39:35.372
Annie-bananie,
it is time for your bed.

39:35.407 --> 39:36.473
Aw, Mom.
Five more minutes?

39:36.508 --> 39:40.677
No, ma'am, your five minutes
was up five minutes ago.

39:40.712 --> 39:43.179
That's my last trick anyways.

39:43.215 --> 39:44.381
All right. Goodnight.

39:44.416 --> 39:45.382
Goodnight.

39:46.752 --> 39:47.917

feed the horses.

Oh, okay. All right, honey.

40:24.289 --> 40:25.722
JR.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.791
Hey, did you and Sam have
a good trail ride today?

40:27.826 --> 40:28.725
I did.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.527
Even took a little walk
through a stream.

40:30.562 --> 40:32.929
My feet are just now
thawing out.

40:32.964 --> 40:34.964
She took you to the grove?

40:35.000 --> 40:35.999
Hmm!

40:37.135 --> 40:38.368
Why "hmm"?

40:38.403 --> 40:39.436
Well, I just...

40:39.471 --> 40:42.572
I don't think she's taken
anybody there since Luke.

40:46.445 --> 40:48.044
A-And who's Luke?

40:48.079 --> 40:49.546
Hmm? Uh, Sam's fiancé.

40:50.816 --> 40:52.215
Well, her ex-fiancé.

40:52.250 --> 40:53.149
Yeah.

40:53.185 --> 40:55.752
They were gonna be married
two years ago

40:55.787 --> 40:57.587
and then he got a job
in Los Angeles,

40:57.622 --> 40:58.988
and Sam couldn't do that,

40:59.024 --> 41:00.957
so it ended.

Oh, yeah?

1:16:27.784 --> 1:16:29.817
And who's that?

1:16:29.852 --> 1:16:33.754
The guy who fell in love
with this place,

1:16:33.790 --> 1:16:36.257
with this life,

1:16:36.292 --> 1:16:39.060
and with... [sighs]

1:16:44.033 --> 1:16:46.968
I know you're not supposed
to mix business and pleasure,

1:16:47.003 --> 1:16:48.970
but it's too late for that now.

1:16:50.206 --> 1:16:51.439
There's no going back.

1:16:56.179 --> 1:16:57.979
I really don't know
what to say to that.

1:16:59.215 --> 1:17:00.548
You heard your colleagues.

1:17:00.583 --> 1:17:02.516
It's over.

1:17:04.988 --> 1:17:07.321
Not necessarily.

1:17:09.392 --> 1:17:11.559
You still have 72 hours
to make back the payments.

1:17:11.594 --> 1:17:13.995
Might as well be 700 hours.

1:17:14.030 --> 1:17:15.096
I don't have the money.

1:17:15.131 --> 1:17:15.997
What if you did?

1:17:17.867 --> 1:17:19.467
Let me make
the mortgage payments current.

1:17:20.737 --> 1:17:22.269
No.

1:17:22.305 --> 1:17:24.105
Thank you, but I don't
need you to rescue me.

1:17:24.140 --> 1:17:25.539
I'm not rescuing you.

You want to invest

1:17:38.154 --> 1:17:39.654
Yeah.

1:17:41.090 --> 1:17:42.189
Why?

1:17:42.225 --> 1:17:43.724
Because I lived it, Sam.

1:17:43.760 --> 1:17:45.726
"Cowboy Code."

1:17:45.762 --> 1:17:47.028
I lived it,

1:17:47.063 --> 1:17:48.429
and I loved it,

1:17:48.464 --> 1:17:49.730
and I know that other people
will love it

1:17:49.766 --> 1:17:50.898
just as much as I did,

1:17:50.933 --> 1:17:53.768
and they'll pay for it, too.

1:17:53.803 --> 1:17:55.603
And mostly
because I don't want to go.

You want to be
my business partner?

1:18:03.179 --> 1:18:04.278
I do.

1:18:05.448 --> 1:18:06.380
What about your job?

1:18:07.784 --> 1:18:09.083
They'll probably fire me.

1:18:10.620 --> 1:18:11.952
That's okay.

1:18:11.988 --> 1:18:14.555
My heart's not really in it.

1:18:14.590 --> 1:18:16.957

for a long time.
