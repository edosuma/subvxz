<i>There are an estimated 8 million people
in the five boroughs of New York.</i>

02:34.691 --> 02:37.277
<i>12 million in the
greater metropolitan area.</i>

02:37.736 --> 02:40.446
<i>There are almost 10 million
telephone exchange lines.</i>

02:40.905 --> 02:43.156
<i>Over 50 phone services.</i>

02:43.407 --> 02:46.366
<i>3 million New Yorkers
are cell phone users.</i>

02:46.576 --> 02:49.789
<i>It used to be a mark of insanity
to see people talk to themselves.</i>

02:50.246 --> 02:55.626
<i>Now it's a mark of status. And speed dial
is quickly replacing the drop of a coin.</i>

02:55.835 --> 02:58.506
<i>Despite increased usage
of cellular devices...</i>

02:58.715 --> 03:02.300
<i>... an estimated 4.5 million residents
and 2 million visitors...</i>

03:02.509 --> 03:06.678
<i>... still utilize pay phones
on a regular basis.</i>

03:11.476 --> 03:14.270
<i>This is the telephone booth
at 53rd and 8th...</i>

03:14.477 --> 03:18.690
<i>... perhaps the last vestige of privacy
on Manhattan 's West Side.</i>

03:18.898 --> 03:22.194
<i>It is the last booth of its type,
still in regular operation.</i>

03:22.402 --> 03:25.197
<i>Up to 300 calls daily originate here.</i>

03:25.405 --> 03:29.824
<i>This location has been burglarized
41 times in the last six months.</i>

03:30.034 --> 03:32.662
<i>Verizon has scheduled this structure
to be torn down...</i>

03:32.871 --> 03:36.582
<i>... and replaced with a kiosk
as of 8 a.m. tomorrow.</i>

03:36.791 --> 03:38.667
<i>Hardly two blocks away...</i>

03:38.876 --> 03:42.922
<i>... meet the man who is to be
the final occupant of that booth.</i>

03:43.131 --> 03:45.467
Donny. Donny. Donny, listen to me.

03:45.674 --> 03:49.259
I said I'd get you magazine coverage,
and I'm getting you in a magazine.

03:49.469 --> 03:52.473
Look, you gotta trust me.
No means yes to these people.

03:52.681 --> 03:54.515
Get "What's Up?" magazine
on the line.

03:54.724 --> 03:55.808
Yeah, I heard you.

03:56.017 --> 03:58.102
Donny, I got "What's Up?" magazine
on the line.

03:58.311 --> 04:00.562
They wanna know about you,
so I'm hanging up.

04:00.980 --> 04:03.608
This is Erica or Lars.
I can't tell the difference.

04:03.816 --> 04:05.527
- You got Stu.
- We said no.

04:05.735 --> 04:08.196
I didn't hear you,
so I'm giving you a second chance.

04:08.405 --> 04:10.029
- We don't do magicians.
- Magicians?

04:10.239 --> 04:13.657
Donny G is an artist who happens
to look like a supermodel.

04:13.867 --> 04:16.870
"- The New Guys" is offering him the cover.
"- New Guys" wants him?

04:17.079 --> 04:19.539
And I haven't told my client,
my favorite client...

04:19.748 --> 04:23.042
...that I am making this call, all right?
He wants "New Guys."

04:23.209 --> 04:25.295
I want you and I can make him
come around...

04:25.463 --> 04:28.591
...but you'll lose us if I don't
hear from you by end of business.

04:28.840 --> 04:31.342
Get "New Guys". Tell him "What's Up?"
Is offering a cover.

04:31.509 --> 04:32.968
Okay. Big Q.

04:33.219 --> 04:37.306
Adam, I know three people looking
for dog walkers. That could be you.

04:37.557 --> 04:40.852
"Sit. Stay. Don't worry, Fluffy,
I'll clean your shit and wipe your ass. "

04:41.101 --> 04:43.146
- You got Stu.
- What's up with my party, Stu?

04:43.353 --> 04:46.147
I was just telling my assistant
to get my favorite client...

04:46.315 --> 04:48.568
...on the phone,
and here you are. Nice.

04:51.027 --> 04:54.279
Listen. Seriously, we gotta look
at a new night for your release party.

04:54.488 --> 04:57.702
There are two premieres, a fundraiser.
All the happening places are booked.

04:57.909 --> 04:58.951
If we move the date...

04:59.160 --> 05:02.497
Voodoo on you-do, motherfucker,
from Big Q to Big Stu!

05:02.706 --> 05:04.916
- Big Q, be reasonable.
- Motherfucker, I'm a gangster!

05:05.123 --> 05:08.711
- I don't gotta be reasonable!
- You're cutting out.

05:08.920 --> 05:12.841
Next time I'm gonna kill your cracker-ass
if you keep talking about me like that!

05:13.049 --> 05:14.340
Right?

05:14.591 --> 05:17.886
N.Y.P.D. Blue, 11 o'clock.

05:18.260 --> 05:21.514
Stuey, the hardest working
PR guy. How's business?

05:21.724 --> 05:24.184
How many times I have
to tell you, Wyatt? I'm a publicist.

05:24.393 --> 05:25.935
- Tickets.
- Tickets.

05:26.143 --> 05:28.145
Four for Britney Spears, right?

05:28.354 --> 05:30.357
You put the "Ho"
in show business, Stuey.

05:30.565 --> 05:33.525
It's Stu. What do you got for me?

05:33.736 --> 05:38.697
They just checked Mrs. Sharp
into Bellevue again.

05:38.905 --> 05:41.409
- Page Six. Tell Britney I send my love.
- All right.

05:41.618 --> 05:43.284
Enjoy the show.

05:43.995 --> 05:47.331
Hold on a sec. Page Six, this is Lana.

05:47.538 --> 05:50.876
Bless you. Lana, it's Stu Shepard.
Bless you.

05:51.085 --> 05:52.878
- Is it you or your boss calling?
- It's me.

05:53.088 --> 05:55.171
I'm looking for some
mutual back-scratching.

05:55.379 --> 05:59.092
You get my privileged N.Y.P.D. Blue
info and I get you to save my ass.

05:59.299 --> 06:00.968
Not now, Stu. I'm a sick woman.

06:01.177 --> 06:03.055
This is going
to make you feel better.

06:03.262 --> 06:07.057
Tony-winning producer Jeffrey Sharp
tossed his wife back into drug rehab.

06:07.265 --> 06:09.433
Nice. What do you want
for that little tidbit?

06:09.642 --> 06:12.938
You better be nice to me while I'm on
the way up and taking your calls.

06:13.147 --> 06:16.483
The higher the monkey climbs,
the more you see of his ass.

06:16.692 --> 06:17.943
Have a heart, Lana.

06:18.152 --> 06:21.946
Listen, today my half-wit assistant
faxed you regarding my favorite client.

06:22.155 --> 06:24.282
Great singer,
about to turn great actress.

06:24.489 --> 06:27.785
- Another little Miss Tits and Ass?
- Look, I'm on cell, no names.

06:27.994 --> 06:31.289
That was strictly in-office information.
You didn't print it, did you?

06:31.496 --> 06:34.124
- I got it.
- All right, tell me Richard didn't see it.

06:34.332 --> 06:36.169
He didn't put it in the column?

06:36.376 --> 06:38.587
Stu's on the phone,
scared he's gonna lose his job.

06:38.796 --> 06:41.130
His office sent you something
by mistake. He wants it.

06:41.339 --> 06:44.467
You tell him T.F.B.
Put that at the top of the column.

06:44.676 --> 06:46.469
- Stu, it ran, sorry.
- Yeah?

06:46.678 --> 06:48.930
- Oh, God. Oh, no.
- I'm really sorry.

06:49.139 --> 06:50.890
Yes!

06:51.766 --> 06:55.144
"What's Up?" magazine offered Donny G
a photo in "What's Hot and Happening."

06:55.353 --> 06:58.065
- Fuck them. Make them sweat.
- He's on a conference call.

06:58.231 --> 07:01.693
He could take a while. Yeah, can he call
you back? Okay. All right, bye.

07:01.901 --> 07:03.152
- Pretty smooth.
- Thank you.

07:03.360 --> 07:05.446
If you can absorb
everything I teach you...

07:05.611 --> 07:09.074
...focus and get a new wardrobe,
you can make it big in public relations.

07:09.241 --> 07:10.827
- I got a sense.
- Cool. Cool. Cool.

07:11.035 --> 07:12.202
- Up, T?
- How you doing, man?

07:12.411 --> 07:14.205
Mario's!

07:15.745 --> 07:17.831
Hey! Hey! Hey! Not so fast, Stu!

07:18.083 --> 07:21.378
How come you run every time
you go past my place, huh?

07:21.587 --> 07:23.672
- Because I'm busy, Mario.
- Yeah?

07:23.881 --> 07:26.132
Well, no more drinks or free meals, okay?

07:26.341 --> 07:30.052
One lousy mention in the "Post",
you expect to eat for six months? No!

07:30.512 --> 07:33.598
Mario, maybe I could throw
the hippest party this month your way.

07:33.806 --> 07:36.349
- Stu.
- No, I couldn't. My clients would kill me.

07:36.600 --> 07:40.229
- What hip party?
- It's just Big Q, the hottest new rap star.

07:40.437 --> 07:43.191
- There'll be local TV coverage...
- Nine and 11.

07:43.399 --> 07:45.610
MTV, BET, VH1.

07:45.817 --> 07:48.486
But I promised other clients,
people who actually pay me.

07:48.695 --> 07:51.071
- No, you owe me.
- It's gotta be the night of the 18th.

07:51.280 --> 07:54.284
Toss in a buffet for 80 people,
record company will pick up the booze...

07:54.493 --> 07:56.160
...and I will deliver you celebrities.

07:56.745 --> 07:59.245
Anything you want, okay?

07:59.455 --> 08:02.667
Expand the menu, wallpaper
those bathrooms, for God's sake.

08:02.917 --> 08:04.711
You only get one shot
with celebrities.

08:05.211 --> 08:07.339
Thank you. Thank you, Stu!

08:07.547 --> 08:09.214
- That was fucking brilliant.
- Listen.

08:09.465 --> 08:12.633
Call Big Q. Tell him we got him
the hippest place in town on his date.

08:12.842 --> 08:14.011
- Call "What's Up?"
- Yeah.

08:14.219 --> 08:15.470
We'll take their offer.

08:15.679 --> 08:17.973
Messenger a bottle of Jameson's
to Lana at Page Six...

08:18.180 --> 08:20.474
...with a note saying... Write this down.
- Got it.

08:20.684 --> 08:24.396
- Irish chicken soup. Love, Stu.
- "Irish chicken soup. Love, Stu. "

08:24.605 --> 08:26.523
- All right, no harm being gracious.
- Yeah.

08:26.732 --> 08:29.067
Okay. Actually, better off,
deliver it over yourself.

08:29.275 --> 08:31.276
- Get to know the players.
- I'll do that.

08:31.485 --> 08:32.777
Thank you for teaching me.

08:32.986 --> 08:35.783
- And, Adam, don't you have a suit?
- Actually, no.

08:36.032 --> 08:37.909
Here. Get yourself one.

08:38.116 --> 08:41.035
- I'm gonna start paying you soon.
- Yeah, I hope so.

08:41.244 --> 08:44.163
- You got a bunch of messages.
- I'm late for a meeting. Hold them.

08:44.414 --> 08:45.457
- All right.
- All right.

08:45.666 --> 08:49.127
- See you, Stu!
- See you, Adam!

09:18.404 --> 09:20.448
- Excuse me.
- I'm trying to make a call here.

09:20.656 --> 09:23.867
This is for you. Half-pepperoni,
half-mushroom, extra crisp.

09:24.076 --> 09:26.578
You ever heard of delivering
a pizza to a phone booth?

09:26.745 --> 09:28.122
I don't think so.

09:28.330 --> 09:32.294
Gentleman occupying phone booth,
53rd, between Broadway and 8th.

09:32.501 --> 09:34.794
It's a mistake.

09:35.254 --> 09:38.046
What am I supposed to do
with the pie? It's all paid for.

09:38.297 --> 09:40.216
There's a homeless guy
around the block.

09:40.425 --> 09:44.138
Give him the pizza and say "You can turn
away, but you can't make it go away. "

09:44.347 --> 09:47.307
He'll think I'm trying to poison him.
They always get that idea.

09:47.474 --> 09:49.934
Get off the fucking pizza, all right?

09:51.186 --> 09:53.438
That language is uncalled for.

09:53.647 --> 09:55.522
Holy shit!

09:55.731 --> 09:59.150
I'm sorry. Please return to sender.

09:59.360 --> 10:01.445
Fuck off.

10:02.363 --> 10:06.867
Here you go, $5. Eat the pizza yourself.
You look like you could use a good meal.

10:26.260 --> 10:27.260
Hello.

10:27.512 --> 10:31.806
Pam, could you believe some nut case
just tried to deliver me a pizza?

10:32.015 --> 10:36.020
Why are you always in the same
phone booth, same time, every day?

10:36.228 --> 10:40.231
- Well, it's quitting time, right?
- Thank God, we were mobbed today.

10:40.439 --> 10:41.607
So how's your day?

10:41.815 --> 10:44.693
It's getting better
by the minute, sweetheart.

10:44.902 --> 10:47.155
Who's the most famous person
you publicized today?

10:47.364 --> 10:49.449
- You.
- Really?

10:49.658 --> 10:53.034
I told a few columnists Mel Gibson
was looking for actresses for his film.

10:53.285 --> 10:57.040
And I said the possibilities
were Cameron Diaz, Julia Roberts...

10:57.249 --> 10:59.834
...and my favorite client, you.

11:00.042 --> 11:01.168
You didn't really do that.

11:01.377 --> 11:03.586
First step toward being noticed
is being mentioned.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.921
I just got out of a
conference at the City Hotel.

11:06.087 --> 11:07.717
I was thinking you
could come down.

11:07.966 --> 11:11.845
There are a couple of people and a few
martinis I'd like to introduce you to.

11:12.053 --> 11:13.931
- Stu, I...
- Listen, Pam. Pam. Pam.

11:14.138 --> 11:16.432
It's about time we talked
about your career. Come on.

11:16.641 --> 11:22.063
I feel awful but I promised my scene
partner that I would rehearse for class.

11:22.271 --> 11:25.566
We're doing a scene from "Jerry Maguire."
I'm playing Renée Zellweger's part.

11:25.732 --> 11:28.444
That's great. Look, I rescheduled
a meeting to see you...

11:28.652 --> 11:30.530
...but I guess I can reschedule it back.

11:30.739 --> 11:33.115
- Are you mad?
- Don't worry about it. I'm not mad.

11:33.281 --> 11:34.866
Maybe tomorrow.

11:35.075 --> 11:36.410
Yeah, later.

11:36.659 --> 11:38.161
- Look, Stu...
- What?

11:38.370 --> 11:39.955
Big kiss.

11:40.164 --> 11:41.623
You too.

11:52.634 --> 11:54.718
<i>- Yeah.
- Isn't it funny?</i>

11:54.928 --> 11:57.387
<i>You hear a phone ring,
and it could be anybody...</i>

11:57.596 --> 12:00.182
<i>... but a ringing phone has to be
answered, doesn't it?</i>

12:00.390 --> 12:01.433
What?

12:01.641 --> 12:04.186
<i>I hope you realize
how you've hurt my feelings.</i>

12:04.393 --> 12:07.897
<i>- Who the fuck is this?
- Don't think about leaving that phone.</i>

12:08.105 --> 12:10.649
<i>- Wrong number, pal.
- It was a perfectly delicious pizza.</i>

12:10.858 --> 12:13.028
<i>You're certainly going
to wish you had accepted it.</i>

12:13.236 --> 12:16.530
Naturally, this is part of the gag.
The pizza bit. That was funny shit.

12:16.740 --> 12:19.910
<i>Well, its purpose was to keep
your strength up for what's coming next.</i>

12:20.159 --> 12:23.245
<i>- What's coming next is I'm hanging up.
- Oh, no, you won't.</i>

12:23.453 --> 12:26.333
<i>- You're going to learn to obey me.
- Obey you?</i>

12:26.541 --> 12:29.083
<i>- Who is this?
- Someone who enjoys watching you.</i>

12:29.293 --> 12:30.335
Watching me?

12:30.542 --> 12:34.672
<i>Yes, I love the suit you're wearing today.
Black on raspberry sorbet. Very Italian.</i>

12:35.840 --> 12:37.758
Where...? Where are you?

12:37.967 --> 12:42.137
<i>There are hundreds of windows out there.
Why don't you check them out?</i>

12:46.768 --> 12:49.645
<i>- So, what am I doing now?
- You're scratching your head.</i>

12:49.853 --> 12:53.357
<i>Now you're brushing your hair back.</i>

12:54.441 --> 12:57.360
<i>That's not very nice, Stu.</i>

12:58.237 --> 12:59.613
Did you call me Stu?

13:00.655 --> 13:04.284
<i>- Who's Stu? I don't know any Stu.
- Why, do you prefer Stuart?</i>

13:04.493 --> 13:06.578
A lot of people in this
neighborhood know me.

13:06.744 --> 13:10.415
<i>Stuart Shepard, 1326 West
51st Street, Third Floor, front.</i>

13:10.624 --> 13:13.666
<i>- Go mind-fuck some other guy, pal.
- I know Pamela McFadden too.</i>

13:13.875 --> 13:16.753
<i>It's not in your best interest
to disconnect me.</i>

13:17.003 --> 13:19.298
<i>Someone could get hurt.</i>

13:19.507 --> 13:22.302
<i>What's the matter, Stu?</i>

13:22.510 --> 13:25.221
If you're some fucked-up,
failed actor I wouldn't handle...

13:25.387 --> 13:28.932
...or some prick intern I fired, I will
hunt you down and I will crush you.

13:29.141 --> 13:30.976
You will never work in this town.

13:31.184 --> 13:32.604
I can turn people into gods...

13:32.811 --> 13:36.313
...and I can turn you into a total
fucking loser if you weren't one already.

13:36.564 --> 13:39.777
Do you hear me?
Am I upsetting you? Hello.

13:39.984 --> 13:42.986
Oh, you think I'm gonna, what?
Pay you off or something?

13:43.196 --> 13:45.948
<i>- Tell me what you want.
- Now you want to talk to me.</i>

13:46.156 --> 13:48.241
Did Adam at my office
put you up to this?

13:48.450 --> 13:51.120
<i>No, I thought this up all by myself.</i>

13:51.330 --> 13:52.831
Keep thinking. I'm hanging up.

13:53.038 --> 13:57.542
<i>I'll say hi to your wife, Kelly, for you.
Talk to you later.</i>

13:58.041 --> 14:00.126
What the...?

14:02.256 --> 14:05.466
<i>The callback feature
cannot be activated...</i>

14:05.884 --> 14:07.552
Motherfucker.

14:34.788 --> 14:39.497
<i>- Tell me what you want.
- I want your complete attention.</i>

14:40.749 --> 14:44.545
<i>- Are you an actor?
- Yes. One of your pathetic failed ones.</i>

14:44.796 --> 14:47.173
<i>- It's tough when you're not known.
- Tell me about it.</i>

14:47.381 --> 14:51.510
<i>You don't have to hunt me and crush me.
I can't get work in this town as it is.</i>

14:51.718 --> 14:55.097
<i>I've done some off-Broadway, some
off-Manhattan plays, but that dried up.</i>

14:55.305 --> 14:58.184
<i>Now I wait tables, clean toilets,
anything to make the rent.</i>

14:58.391 --> 15:00.144
<i>I'm a walking cliché.</i>

15:00.351 --> 15:02.270
I can help you.
I can get you auditions.

15:02.477 --> 15:04.688
<i>Auditions? You're not an agent.
You're a publicist.</i>

15:04.898 --> 15:08.151
Yeah, but I have contacts.
I know agents. I can get you an audition.

15:08.358 --> 15:10.360
<i>- Really?
- Yeah.</i>

15:10.570 --> 15:13.613
<i>Well, there is someone
I'd like you to call.</i>

15:13.823 --> 15:14.907
Name it.

15:15.116 --> 15:19.162
<i>Try the number you dialed
when you first got into the booth.</i>

15:20.038 --> 15:21.956
<i>- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No?</i>

15:22.165 --> 15:24.124
<i>Lucky you then,
because I wrote it down.</i>

15:24.333 --> 15:27.752
<i>I can see every number you pressed.
Let's see if Pam is still at work.</i>

15:28.002 --> 15:30.088
<i>- No.
- Then I guess I'll have to do it.</i>

15:30.297 --> 15:33.301
<i>- Look, don't!
- Too late. It's already ringing.</i>

15:33.508 --> 15:37.761
<i>- I'll put her on speaker so you can hear.
- You're fucking kidding me.</i>

15:37.971 --> 15:41.724
<i>Stu, I never kid.</i>

15:46.978 --> 15:50.442
<i>- Hello.
- Well, hello, Pam.</i>

15:50.650 --> 15:53.776
<i>- Hi, who's this?
- It's a good friend of Stu's.</i>

15:53.985 --> 15:56.904
<i>- And he hasn't got many.
- You know Stu?</i>

15:57.113 --> 16:00.117
<i>I know he lies.</i>

16:00.325 --> 16:02.286
<i>- Who is this?
- Don't worry about that.</i>

16:02.495 --> 16:06.039
<i>Stu's listening in. He can hear
what we're saying about him.</i>

16:06.248 --> 16:09.501
- Stu, is that true? Are you there?
- Pam, hang up the goddamn phone!

16:09.708 --> 16:11.751
<i>She can't hear you, Stu.</i>

16:11.961 --> 16:16.089
<i>Pam, I'm afraid Stu hasn't been
totally honest with you.</i>

16:16.298 --> 16:17.883
- What do you mean?
- Don't do this.

16:18.050 --> 16:20.551
<i>- Stu has been lying to you.
- Pam, hang up.</i>

16:20.760 --> 16:22.930
<i>Now, why would a man
who has a cell phone...</i>

16:23.139 --> 16:26.393
<i>... call you every day
from a phone booth?</i>

16:26.602 --> 16:31.562
<i>- Because he said it's quiet.
- Pam, that's just stupid.</i>

16:31.771 --> 16:34.358
<i>It's because his wife checks
his cell phone bills.</i>

16:34.566 --> 16:39.655
<i>- No record of his calls to you.
- Jesus Christ.</i>

16:39.862 --> 16:43.742
<i>- He said he wasn't married.
- Oh, he's married.</i>

16:43.949 --> 16:47.662
<i>Her name is Kelly. I've never seen her
but she sounds lovely.</i>

16:47.869 --> 16:50.538
<i>Why do you think
he invites you to the City Hotel?</i>

16:50.748 --> 16:52.665
<i>- Cheap rooms for cheap girls.
- Asshole.</i>

16:52.874 --> 16:55.753
<i>He's telling you all this
so you'll sleep with him.</i>

16:55.961 --> 16:58.504
- He's lying, Pam. Don't listen.
- I know that, okay?

16:58.672 --> 17:01.049
I may be from Montana,
but we have men there also.

17:01.257 --> 17:03.551
I wasn't planning
on sleeping with him.

17:03.760 --> 17:06.095
I just don't know a lot
of people here right now.

17:06.304 --> 17:09.307
And he's cute and he said
that he would help me.

17:09.515 --> 17:13.976
<i>- You never asked me if I was married.
- He's never made anyone a star. Bye.</i>

17:15.436 --> 17:16.436
Hello?

17:16.688 --> 17:17.691
<i>Back to you, Stu.</i>

17:17.858 --> 17:20.608
Gotta hit this trick before
the next bitch takes my score.

17:20.776 --> 17:25.531
- Go away.
- Go away? Hang up the phone, nigga.

17:27.616 --> 17:34.245
This motherfucker,
you don't eyeball me. Bitch.

17:34.956 --> 17:37.416
Why are you doing this?
Did I ever harm you? Did I...?

17:37.624 --> 17:40.336
<i>- Now, let's call Kelly.
- She's not home.</i>

17:40.545 --> 17:43.713
<i>Oh, but I'm sure
she's at the shop on Columbus.</i>

17:43.922 --> 17:45.548
How the fuck do you
know all this shit?

17:45.757 --> 17:50.762
<i>Speed dial her. Press "auto one. "
That's her button.</i>

17:50.971 --> 17:53.641
<i>- What am I supposed to say?
- Why don't you try the truth?</i>

17:53.850 --> 17:56.642
<i>- You're cheating.
- I'm not cheating on Kelly. I never have.</i>

17:56.851 --> 17:59.187
<i>- Then what do you call it?
- Look, you're a guy...</i>

17:59.394 --> 18:01.898
...sometimes you want to know
it's a possibility.

18:02.065 --> 18:03.816
It's like having a beautiful home...

18:03.983 --> 18:06.110
...but you still dream
of that quick vacation.

18:06.318 --> 18:09.822
You know, some nice hotel room
with a great view, maybe a pool.

18:10.030 --> 18:11.991
It's just a fantasy.
You never leave home.

18:12.200 --> 18:15.286
<i>- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- Kelly is a home and Pam is a motel.</i>

18:15.494 --> 18:18.121
<i>- I'm sure they'll both appreciate that.
- Fuck you.</i>

18:18.331 --> 18:20.916
<i>Hey, that kind of language
is uncalled for.</i>

18:21.124 --> 18:24.086
You can't take up the whole booth.
This here's my business.

18:24.295 --> 18:26.213
This is not the only phone
in New York.

18:26.421 --> 18:29.173
It's the only one on 8th Avenue
that's working.

18:29.424 --> 18:33.929
- Bullshit! Go in a restaurant, but get lost.
- Motherfucker, this is my phone. Get...

18:34.138 --> 18:37.891
Goddamn it, man! You done made me
hurt my dick hand.

18:38.100 --> 18:41.768
I'm sure you're just as good
with the other hand. Yeah, go away.

18:42.017 --> 18:47.108
I'll be back, motherfucker.
I will be back, bitch. Get out of my way!

18:47.358 --> 18:51.445
<i>I was worried for you. I thought she was
gonna put an eye out with that hand.</i>

18:51.652 --> 18:54.490
Whoever you are, you're obviously
a very intelligent man.

18:54.698 --> 18:57.284
I know what stress does.
It's all I can do from going crazy myself.

18:57.493 --> 19:00.494
<i>- You're calling me crazy?
- No, you're going through a difficult time.</i>

19:00.660 --> 19:02.163
Look, please don't call my wife.

19:02.372 --> 19:04.624
Let me give you
my office number. We'll talk.

19:04.831 --> 19:07.710
I know a reasonable photographer
who will do some headshots.

19:07.918 --> 19:10.546
<i>Stu, do you really think
that I'm an actor?</i>

19:11.046 --> 19:14.508
<i>I'm not an actor.
I have no use for you, Stu. None.</i>

19:14.715 --> 19:17.596
<i>I would just like you to tell Kelly
the truth about yourself.</i>

19:17.844 --> 19:21.140
<i>So are you going to call Kelly
and tell her about Pam?</i>

19:21.349 --> 19:23.517
<i>- Or do I have to?
- No!</i>

19:23.725 --> 19:27.061
Jesus, no. I'm doing it.

19:31.940 --> 19:34.109
<i>Feeling kind of nervous, Stu?</i>

19:39.115 --> 19:42.034
<i>- Hello.
- Hold it to the receiver so I can hear.</i>

19:42.243 --> 19:44.327
- Stu?
- Yeah.

19:44.536 --> 19:48.289
- Where are you?
- I'm in a phone booth.

19:48.498 --> 19:52.960
Baby, I just got this call from this guy
who said you'd be calling me...

19:53.170 --> 19:56.714
...from a booth to tell me
something important.

19:56.922 --> 19:59.216
There's a lot of prank calling
going on today, baby.

19:59.466 --> 20:01.969
<i>- Tell her you invite women...
- Shut up.</i>

20:02.178 --> 20:04.054
<i>... to have drinks at discreet hotels.</i>

20:04.263 --> 20:07.014
I'm not talking to you, baby.

20:07.223 --> 20:08.392
<i>Someone's got company.</i>

20:08.559 --> 20:10.519
- Who's that woman?
- Bitch got a cell phone!

20:10.728 --> 20:14.106
- Some hooker is trying to use the phone.
- He just called me a hooker.

20:14.314 --> 20:18.651
- Are you sure there's nothing wrong?
- We are escorts. Escorts.

20:18.860 --> 20:20.737
<i>Tell her you want to sleep
with other women.</i>

20:20.945 --> 20:23.574
There is this person
and he's saying things about me.

20:23.783 --> 20:25.157
Things that might not be true.

20:25.409 --> 20:29.454
And if he calls you... Get the fuck out
of here before I call the cops!

20:29.662 --> 20:31.539
<i>Honey, I want
to sleep with other women.</i>

20:31.872 --> 20:34.291
Look, Kelly, whatever he says,
don't believe him.

20:34.500 --> 20:37.628
<i>- I haven't done anything.
- Only because Pam had to rehearse.</i>

20:37.837 --> 20:39.713
Shut the fuck up!

20:39.922 --> 20:44.343
Stu, I don't know what you're
talking about, but you're scaring me.

20:44.552 --> 20:46.010
I'm sorry, baby.

20:46.220 --> 20:49.764
Can you just come over
to the store so we can talk in person?

20:50.597 --> 20:53.266
- I feel kind of weird.
- Yeah. Look, I'll try. Don't worry.

20:53.475 --> 20:55.352
- Come on!
- Yeah, bitch!

20:55.561 --> 20:57.146
<i>- I love you too.
- "I love you. "</i>

20:57.354 --> 21:00.107
Get out of here before
I have you deported to Jersey.

21:00.357 --> 21:02.484
- You're a fucking ass!
- And you're a dirty skank.

21:02.692 --> 21:07.656
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Your mama is a skank, bitch!

21:07.865 --> 21:10.618
<i>You didn't tell your wife
the truth, did you, Stu?</i>

21:10.825 --> 21:13.036
<i>And you can tell she really loves you.</i>

21:13.245 --> 21:15.247
<i>Must be nice to have
a pretty girl care for you.</i>

21:15.454 --> 21:17.332
Why screw up her life?
She never did you harm.

21:17.539 --> 21:19.168
<i>Everybody does harm.</i>

21:19.583 --> 21:21.336
That's it. This mind-fuck is over.

21:21.544 --> 21:27.133
<i>Stu, if you hang up, I will kill you.</i>

21:28.052 --> 21:31.678
What are you going to do about it
with your goddamn binoculars?

21:31.929 --> 21:33.513
<i>I never said I had binoculars.</i>

21:33.721 --> 21:36.808
<i>I have a highly magnified
telescopic image of you.</i>

21:37.015 --> 21:40.104
<i>Now what kind of device
has a telescopic sight mounted on it?</i>

21:40.312 --> 21:42.939
What? You mean like a rifle?

21:43.189 --> 21:46.567
<i>A.30-caliber bolt-action 700
with a carbon-one modification...</i>

21:46.774 --> 21:49.905
<i>... and a state-of-the-art
Hensholdt tactical scope.</i>

21:50.155 --> 21:54.324
<i>- And it's staring straight at you.
- Yeah, how's my fucking hair?</i>

21:54.533 --> 21:58.412
<i>At this range, the exit wound ought to be
about the size of a small tangerine.</i>

21:58.620 --> 22:02.333
Nice try, pal. Go to hell.

22:02.542 --> 22:06.878
<i>Now, doesn't that just
torque your jaws?</i>

22:07.587 --> 22:09.214
<i>I love that.</i>

22:09.423 --> 22:11.884
<i>You know, like in the movies
just as the good guy...</i>

22:12.051 --> 22:14.554
<i>... is about to kill
the bad guy, he cocks his gun.</i>

22:15.136 --> 22:17.096
<i>Now why didn't he have it cocked?</i>

22:17.346 --> 22:21.267
<i>Because that sound is scary.</i>

22:21.476 --> 22:22.892
<i>It's cool, isn't it?</i>

22:23.103 --> 22:26.606
Look, you shoot a gun here
and there'll be pandemonium.

22:26.813 --> 22:29.191
Do you hear me?
There will be cops all over this block.

22:29.400 --> 22:34.363
<i>Do you think so? Let's see. One. Two.</i>

22:34.572 --> 22:36.741
<i>That won't help you.</i>

22:36.990 --> 22:38.575
<i>Three.</i>

22:40.910 --> 22:45.123
<i>Stu, look at everybody.
Look at all of the people screaming, Stu.</i>

22:45.916 --> 22:47.667
<i>Here come the cops.</i>

22:47.876 --> 22:51.546
<i>Sniper on the roof.
Gunfire, hit the deck.</i>

22:51.797 --> 22:55.342
<i>Stu, you still with me?</i>

22:55.551 --> 22:57.803
<i>Stand up and be a man.</i>

23:00.262 --> 23:04.139
So do you mean you would whack me
for no particular reason?

23:04.348 --> 23:10.063
<i>No, I have plenty of reasons,
and you keep giving me more.</i>

23:10.605 --> 23:13.774
<i>- Shall I take care of him?
- No! No. Shit, no.</i>

23:14.149 --> 23:16.613
<i>It would be so easy.</i>

23:16.821 --> 23:18.363
Here.

23:18.572 --> 23:20.073
Here.

23:22.616 --> 23:26.202
<i>Stu, you just gave that gentleman
$ 10 to walk away.</i>

23:26.412 --> 23:29.666
<i>You saved his life.
You do have a sensitive side.</i>

23:29.874 --> 23:33.586
<i>- How much to let me go?
- Let's see how sensitive you really are.</i>

23:34.294 --> 23:37.673
<i>I'm aiming at you right now.</i>

23:37.881 --> 23:42.510
<i>Can you feel it, the heat of it?</i>

23:42.719 --> 23:45.055
<i>Come now, Stu, you can feel it.</i>

23:45.261 --> 23:47.472
<i>Concentrate.</i>

23:47.722 --> 23:50.059
<i>Concentrate.</i>

23:50.308 --> 23:51.977
<i>Take a look at where I'm going.</i>

23:54.563 --> 23:56.732
<i>You're doing so much better
than the others.</i>

23:56.941 --> 23:59.693
<i>You read about the German porn king
shot 10 days ago...</i>

23:59.903 --> 24:01.569
<i>... at 38th and 8th?</i>

24:01.821 --> 24:05.156
<i>He thought he was an artist and wouldn't
admit he was just a pedophile.</i>

24:05.323 --> 24:07.701
<i>Believe me, he had plenty
of chances to come clean.</i>

24:08.201 --> 24:11.955
<i>You must have read about the corporate
executive shot at 47th and 10th.</i>

24:12.205 --> 24:15.000
<i>What you didn't read
was that he cashed in all of his stocks...</i>

24:15.251 --> 24:18.419
<i>... just before the bottom fell out,
while all the little guys lost everything.</i>

24:19.378 --> 24:22.006
<i>Now if he had been willing
to make amends...</i>

24:22.257 --> 24:24.509
<i>... share the money,
things might have been different.</i>

24:24.718 --> 24:29.472
<i>Please, tell me,
where am I aiming now?</i>

24:30.138 --> 24:32.933
<i>- Below the shoulder.
- Which one?</i>

24:33.141 --> 24:35.102
The right shoulder.

24:35.310 --> 24:38.272
<i>- Love to love you too, baby!
- That's phenomenal, Stu.</i>

24:38.480 --> 24:41.525
<i>You're doing so much better
than the others.</i>

24:41.734 --> 24:44.736
<i>What do you remember
about those killings, Stu?</i>

24:44.945 --> 24:46.029
I don't know.

24:46.280 --> 24:48.864
<i>Well, you think of yourself
as a smart guy, Stu. Try.</i>

24:49.073 --> 24:52.618
<i>- They got shot. I don't know, all right?
- Okay, I'll give you a hint.</i>

24:52.825 --> 24:56.288
<i>Wallets, watches, everything
was left on their bodies.</i>

24:56.497 --> 24:59.416
Because they weren't robberies.
They were executions.

24:59.625 --> 25:01.252
<i>They didn't have to be.</i>

25:01.667 --> 25:03.254
What did I do
to deserve this? Why me?

25:03.463 --> 25:07.841
<i>If you have to ask,
then you're not ready to know yet.</i>

25:08.048 --> 25:11.385
- Right here. Shit. Come on.
- Jesus. You, in the booth.

25:11.635 --> 25:12.678
- Come on.
- Now what?

25:12.886 --> 25:15.305
You got any idea how much pain
you're making in my life?

25:15.515 --> 25:17.057
- Hey, look at me.
- Look, I hear you!

25:17.308 --> 25:20.102
Look me in the eye.
Hang up the phone and walk away.

25:20.311 --> 25:22.812
<i>- Don't do it.
- I got my own problems.</i>

25:23.064 --> 25:24.897
I'm your problem.
You know why?

25:25.106 --> 25:28.652
My girls keep yapping at me,
"Leon, he won't share the phone. "

25:28.860 --> 25:30.196
"Leon, he told us to fuck off. "

25:30.739 --> 25:34.197
"We're gonna make you nuts unless you
make him get off the fucking phone. "

25:34.406 --> 25:38.411
- I'm trying to run a fucking business.
- I sympathize, but I can't get off the call.

25:38.662 --> 25:41.539
No, you don't understand me.
I got the G-string union here.

25:41.747 --> 25:43.040
They're breaking my balls.

25:43.249 --> 25:45.752
I gotta live with their shit,
but not yours.

25:45.959 --> 25:49.631
So I'm saying this once, nice, all right?
Hang up the phone. Walk away.

25:49.840 --> 25:52.301
<i>- He did say it nicely.
- He got a cell phone up in there too.</i>

25:52.508 --> 25:55.301
- It ain't even like he need a phone!
- I can't get off the call!

25:55.510 --> 25:58.930
Shut the fuck up! Do you hear that shit?
It's like nails on a chalkboard.

25:59.138 --> 26:01.642
They ain't gonna fucking stop,
till I get their way.

26:01.851 --> 26:06.353
- I'm getting a fucking headache, pal.
- All right. I'll pay you to go away.

26:06.605 --> 26:09.566
I don't want your money. I want you
to hang up the phone and get out.

26:09.775 --> 26:13.696
<i>- $ 120. It's all yours.
- Everybody has their price, right, Stu?</i>

26:13.946 --> 26:16.697
You're gonna give me $ 120
to rent the booth the bums piss in?

26:16.906 --> 26:19.616
- Yeah, I'm a nice guy.
- Something ain't right with him.

26:19.824 --> 26:22.161
Look at that sweat pouring off
that son of a bitch.

26:22.328 --> 26:25.538
- This one sick mother we started with.
- It's probably catching too.

26:25.747 --> 26:26.916
- Yo.
- He's got AIDS.

26:27.124 --> 26:29.542
- How long you want to rent the booth?
- Indefinitely.

26:29.751 --> 26:30.752
- Indefinitely?
- Yes.

26:30.961 --> 26:33.422
Do I look like a asshole?
Let me tell you something.

26:33.632 --> 26:37.009
- $500 gets you indefinitely.
- Wait up! Hold the fuck up!

26:37.216 --> 26:42.303
How come he's defying you, huh?
What, you got bitch in you now?

26:42.512 --> 26:48.060
- Did I say shut the fuck up?
- Yeah, now talk to him like that!

26:48.269 --> 26:50.271
Jesus Christ. Are you enjoying this?

26:51.646 --> 26:54.275
<i>- Do you need help?
- Look, I'm handling it.</i>

26:54.484 --> 26:56.277
<i>- Come on!
- I can help you, Stu.</i>

26:56.486 --> 26:59.695
I wasn't gonna kill you before,
but you changed my fucking mind.

27:00.697 --> 27:04.827
I would take off if I was you.
He gonna kick your ass.

27:05.035 --> 27:07.787
- He gonna kick your ass.
- Get the fuck out!

27:07.996 --> 27:10.040
Can you get out of here?
Will you go away?

27:10.248 --> 27:12.917
<i>- He looks very angry.
- Come on. I, look...</i>

27:13.167 --> 27:14.377
<i>- Hang up.
- Get rid of him.</i>

27:14.585 --> 27:16.461
- Hang up the phone!
- We can work this out!

27:16.712 --> 27:18.173
<i>- Get rid of him!
- Hang up the phone.</i>

27:18.382 --> 27:21.300
I got a watch.
It's a Solaris, $2000 retail.

27:21.549 --> 27:23.551
Yeah? I got a gold Rolex, motherfucker.

27:23.760 --> 27:26.639
You got five seconds to get off
the fucking phone. Five.

27:26.848 --> 27:30.183
<i>- Batter up.
- Four.</i>

27:30.434 --> 27:32.561
<i>I can stop him.</i>

27:32.810 --> 27:33.936
Three.

27:34.187 --> 27:38.233
<i>- Just say the word, Stu.
- Two. One.</i>

27:38.485 --> 27:40.027
No, no. Don't. Don't.

27:41.570 --> 27:43.403
Fuck.

27:43.653 --> 27:45.572
<i>This will count as a hang up.</i>

27:45.780 --> 27:49.326
<i>I can make him stop.
Just say the word. Can you hear me?</i>

27:49.536 --> 27:50.536
<i>- Yes.
- What?</i>

27:50.785 --> 27:53.414
Yes!

27:53.622 --> 27:55.499
- Whose street is this?
- That's right, baby.

27:55.749 --> 27:58.000
Oh, my God.

27:58.210 --> 28:00.212
Baby, you bleeding?
You must've cut yourself...

28:00.421 --> 28:01.963
- What's wrong?
- You cut yourself.

28:02.172 --> 28:06.509
- What's wrong? What's wrong?
- Baby? Leon? Leon!

28:06.758 --> 28:08.553
- He was fucking shot!
- Oh, my God!

28:08.802 --> 28:11.013
- Motherfucker!
- He's shot!

28:11.222 --> 28:12.724
Leon!

28:12.932 --> 28:15.560
Somebody call an ambulance!

28:15.809 --> 28:18.146
- Call 411!
- 911, dumb bitch!

28:18.395 --> 28:20.315
He ain't breathing.
Call the meat wagon!

28:20.523 --> 28:23.317
- Shut the fuck up!
- You shot him.

28:23.526 --> 28:26.277
<i>- Why'd you fucking shoot him?
- You said, "Yes. "</i>

28:26.486 --> 28:28.738
"Yes, I can hear you,"
not, "Yes, kill him! "

28:28.987 --> 28:31.324
<i>You ought to be more careful
with what you say.</i>

28:31.533 --> 28:33.452
Oh, my God.

28:33.702 --> 28:35.829
- Motherfucker, why?!
- It wasn't me!

28:36.036 --> 28:38.832
- Where's the gun? Do you see a gun?
- Fuck you!

28:39.039 --> 28:42.502
You pumped one into him, bitch!
I saw it! He's got a Glock!

28:42.753 --> 28:45.422
Get down! Get the fuck down!
Daddy got a Glock!

28:45.671 --> 28:48.841
What Glock? I don't have a fucking Glock!
It's a telephone!

28:49.090 --> 28:53.470
You shot my man, daddy!
They gonna skin and fry your ass!

28:53.720 --> 28:58.557
You shot my baby, daddy!
Mr. Motherfucker! Mr. Motherfucker!

28:58.767 --> 29:00.768
Please, come on! Come in here, bitch!

29:01.184 --> 29:02.186
Better run, motherfucker!

29:02.395 --> 29:05.566
The cops is coming and I hope
they fry your ass down!

29:05.774 --> 29:07.526
I'm not going anywhere, am I?

29:07.734 --> 29:11.778
<i>If you had dealt with the man decently,
this might not have been necessary.</i>

29:11.987 --> 29:14.949
Look, I offered him money.
I offered him my watch.

29:15.157 --> 29:17.743
<i>But not your respect,
which is what he really wanted.</i>

29:17.952 --> 29:21.830
<i>You were dismissive like you dismissed
the nice pizza guy.</i>

29:22.539 --> 29:26.043
<i>You are guilty of inhumanity
to your fellow man.</i>

29:26.252 --> 29:27.961
I'm not guilty of a goddamn thing.

29:28.170 --> 29:31.713
<i>Take responsibility
for what you've done, Stu. Be a man.</i>

29:31.923 --> 29:35.176
I love this fucking spin. You shoot
the guy, and I'm fucking responsible?

29:35.384 --> 29:37.178
<i>Well, looked that way from up here.</i>

29:37.386 --> 29:40.182
I don't know what I did to
you but whatever it was, I'm glad.

29:40.348 --> 29:42.391
I wish it had been worse.
I wish you died!

29:42.600 --> 29:46.894
<i>- Yes, finally some honesty.
- Just tell me who you are.</i>

29:47.105 --> 29:50.815
<i>No one you'd ever notice.
I don't run in your circles.</i>

29:51.025 --> 29:53.735
<i>- And what is it you do?
- I watch.</i>

29:53.943 --> 29:56.695
<i>- You watch?
- Yes, well, what else is there to do...</i>

29:56.905 --> 30:00.158
<i>... when life turns on you and you've
retreated into some small room?</i>

30:00.409 --> 30:01.700
<i>You look out your window.</i>

30:01.868 --> 30:05.579
<i>You see people come in and out of this
phone booth. The same ones every day.</i>

30:05.788 --> 30:08.790
<i>You make up names for them.
You imagine their stories.</i>

30:09.751 --> 30:12.962
<i>But eventually, you get tired
of imagining and follow one of them.</i>

30:14.256 --> 30:16.089
<i>And you hear all of his lies.</i>

30:16.299 --> 30:19.133
<i>And you decide that his sins
should be punished.</i>

30:19.343 --> 30:23.847
<i>Some guy shouting into a cell phone full
of self-importance isn't gonna notice me.</i>

30:24.056 --> 30:29.144
<i>But I noticed that German porn king,
and I noticed that corrupt executive.</i>

30:29.353 --> 30:31.481
<i>And I noticed you, Stu.</i>

30:32.814 --> 30:36.608
- I'm flattered.
- Operator 553. What is your emergency?

30:36.817 --> 30:37.984
Will you please respond?

30:38.151 --> 30:41.488
What was so interesting about a guy
in a phone booth on 53rd and 8th?

30:41.654 --> 30:43.615
The Stu Show. "Better than TV."

30:43.866 --> 30:47.161
Look, how'd I get so lucky to be
picked up by a killer with a rifle?!

30:47.368 --> 30:51.622
<i>You had it made.
Kelly at home, Pam on the side.</i>

30:51.831 --> 30:55.711
<i>I saw Pam once. I followed her
to her restaurant. Lovely.</i>

30:55.920 --> 30:58.295
<i>Life has given you
more than your fair share, Stu.</i>

30:58.504 --> 31:00.839
<i>But it appears you don't appreciate it.</i>

31:01.049 --> 31:03.842
Look, look, listen,
appearances can be deceiving.

31:04.051 --> 31:07.763
I may look confident, but I'm really,
actually just crying out for help!

31:07.971 --> 31:09.306
Help! You know?

31:09.515 --> 31:14.688
<i>I'm trying to help you, Stu,
but you won't help yourself.</i>

31:18.023 --> 31:20.776
<i>- Fuck.
- What's the matter, Stu?</i>

31:23.694 --> 31:26.156
<i>- You shot me!
- It's time you learn, Stu.</i>

31:26.365 --> 31:29.909
<i>- Deception can't go unrewarded.
- Deception! What fucking deception?</i>

31:30.118 --> 31:35.706
<i>"Are you in need of immediate police
or medical response?"</i>

31:36.458 --> 31:39.544
Shit. You bugged the fucking booth.

31:39.753 --> 31:42.128
That's how you knew.
That's how you knew about Pam.

31:42.337 --> 31:46.299
<i>- You picked the wrong person to lie to.
- Look, I didn't pick you.</i>

31:46.507 --> 31:49.094
It must have been
your flashy suit that attracted me.

31:49.302 --> 31:52.096
I get fucked on account of my clothes?
That why you killed Leon?

31:52.306 --> 31:54.182
<i>I didn't kill Leon because
of the way he dressed.</i>

31:54.391 --> 31:57.100
And those other two guys as well?
Did they dress too nice?

31:57.309 --> 32:00.438
<i>You must feel really expensive
when you walk out the door.</i>

32:00.857 --> 32:02.107
All right, here come the cops.

32:02.315 --> 32:03.816
What are you gonna do? Run?

32:04.024 --> 32:06.151
<i>No, I'm not a coward
like some people I know.</i>

32:06.402 --> 32:09.112
<i>- You can get away if you run now.
- You'll blame me for Leon.</i>

32:09.321 --> 32:12.323
No, no, I'll confess I shot him
with my fucking phone.

32:12.574 --> 32:15.037
<i>Well, then I urge you
to keep one thing in mind, Stu.</i>

32:15.244 --> 32:18.496
<i>Take a look at your chest. You saw how
accurate I can be, how lethal.</i>

32:18.746 --> 32:20.583
Kill me now,
and you give yourself away.

32:20.792 --> 32:23.126
<i>Not with a silencer.
It would take these guys...</i>

32:23.335 --> 32:26.587
<i>... the rest of the day to figure out it
wasn't one of their own men that did it.</i>

32:26.796 --> 32:29.256
<i>You can be shot 41 times
for pulling out your wallet.</i>

32:29.505 --> 32:33.302
Throw down your weapon
and come out with your hands raised.

32:33.552 --> 32:35.512
<i>- Ignore him.
- Yeah, what if they open fire?</i>

32:35.721 --> 32:38.390
<i>They won't. Look around you, Stu.</i>

32:38.640 --> 32:40.892
<i>Do you see the tourists
with the video cameras?</i>

32:41.101 --> 32:42.853
<i>The ones hoping the cops
will blow you away...</i>

32:43.062 --> 32:45.856
<i>... so they can sell the tape
"to" The Most Gory Police Shootouts?</i>

32:46.065 --> 32:48.691
<i>Don't worry, they'll keep
the police on their best behavior.</i>

32:48.899 --> 32:53.989
<i>So long as you don't take
hostile action, you should be safe.</i>

32:54.198 --> 32:55.698
Safe? You call this safe?

32:55.906 --> 33:00.160
I got a whole fucking precinct here
with guns pointed my way.

33:00.870 --> 33:06.000
With both hands raised,
moving slowly, step out of the booth.

33:06.209 --> 33:08.961
If we see any signs of a weapon
we will respond.

33:09.211 --> 33:10.836
You won't because there isn't any!

33:11.046 --> 33:12.964
Put down the phone
and raise your hands!

33:13.214 --> 33:15.258
Look, I can't.
I'm on an important call.

33:15.802 --> 33:17.385
Verify this information for me.

33:17.593 --> 33:19.888
The guy in the booth
shot that guy over there...

33:20.096 --> 33:21.973
...and stuck around
to make a phone call.

33:22.140 --> 33:24.600
Yeah, that's what the hookers
are saying.

33:24.809 --> 33:27.354
All right, give me the horn.

33:31.399 --> 33:36.237
- Sir! I'm ordering you to fully comply.
- I'm busy, all right. Come back later.

33:36.445 --> 33:39.739
<i>- Very good, Stu.
- Step out of the booth...</i>

33:39.948 --> 33:43.244
...and raise your hands.
I am giving you an order.

33:43.452 --> 33:45.744
<i>I give the orders here, Stu, don't I?</i>

33:45.995 --> 33:48.249
This guy is looking for us
to kill him, captain.

33:48.416 --> 33:50.918
Suicide by a cop?
Well, that's not gonna happen.

33:51.418 --> 33:53.044
Get that body out of here fast.

33:53.251 --> 33:55.545
Somebody get the body.
Tell the ambulance to get the body.

33:56.255 --> 34:00.385
<i>Thousands of people die every day,
but you put one dead body...</i>

34:00.594 --> 34:03.220
<i>... in the middle of a busy street
and it makes people crazy.</i>

34:03.429 --> 34:08.726
<i>Look at these guys.
You can smell the fear.</i>

34:09.018 --> 34:13.147
<i>- Ten cops.
- This reminds me of Nam.</i>

34:13.355 --> 34:15.398
<i>- Vietnam?
- Yes, Vietnam.</i>

34:15.607 --> 34:18.609
I was too young to go,
but I've seen pictures.

34:18.817 --> 34:22.614
<i>Well, pictures can't do it, Stu.
You can't imagine the fear, the stench.</i>

34:22.821 --> 34:26.493
<i>Napalm-charred bodies, children
leaving grenades in your boots.</i>

34:26.702 --> 34:30.161
<i>- Then you got blamed for the war.
- I came home and people spit on me.</i>

34:30.371 --> 34:32.581
Yeah, this country
owes you an apology.

34:32.790 --> 34:36.502
Look, I just had this vision of you,
of a kid, coming back from the war...

34:36.710 --> 34:40.295
...inured to the killing,
not able to get work, isolated.

34:40.504 --> 34:42.882
I think that could be made
into an affecting story...

34:43.091 --> 34:45.302
...and, you know, one
that everyone understands.

34:45.551 --> 34:47.929
And I think cops
are on the side of vets.

34:48.136 --> 34:51.516
<i>You are pathetic, Stu.
Why don't you wake up?</i>

34:51.725 --> 34:55.562
<i>Napalm-charred bodies?
I'd have to be 50 to be in that war!</i>

34:55.771 --> 34:57.562
Stop fucking with my head, please!

34:57.980 --> 34:58.981
I'm gonna go talk to him.

34:59.189 --> 35:00.858
Shouldn't we wait
on the ESU negotiator?

35:01.065 --> 35:04.278
They could take 20 minutes. I'm not
gonna take a chance on this one.

35:04.445 --> 35:05.779
I'm gonna handle this.

35:06.030 --> 35:10.200
Sir! I'm taking out my weapon.

35:10.409 --> 35:12.827
Putting my weapon down on the car.

35:13.036 --> 35:14.914
- The captain's going in.
- I'm not armed.

35:15.163 --> 35:18.249
- Yeah, neither am I.
- My name is Ramey.

35:18.458 --> 35:20.333
- Captain Ed Ramey.
- All right.

35:20.542 --> 35:22.336
- What's yours?
- I don't want to be friends.

35:22.586 --> 35:25.632
I don't know. It looks like
you could use a friend right now.

35:25.881 --> 35:28.593
<i>- Tell him you've already got a friend.
- I already got a friend.</i>

35:28.843 --> 35:29.844
Is that who you're
talking to on the phone?

35:32.138 --> 35:34.765
Look, I just want to hear
your side of it. That's all.

35:35.016 --> 35:38.227
I ain't got no side of it,
and I didn't shoot anybody.

35:38.477 --> 35:40.312
You see a fucking gun
anywhere? Look.

35:40.563 --> 35:43.188
It's in your back pocket!
I see it! He been...

35:44.982 --> 35:47.777
Sir, do you have the weapon
in your pocket?

35:48.070 --> 35:51.698
No. I got a cell phone and I got
cigarettes. I got no fucking weapon.

35:51.906 --> 35:54.533
Then what are you doing
in a phone booth making calls?

35:55.116 --> 35:57.120
- You want to see it? Here.
- Hey!

35:57.537 --> 35:59.290
Don't reach for that! Hold your fire!

36:00.580 --> 36:02.416
I don't need to see it.
I know what's there.

36:02.666 --> 36:05.960
I got plenty of witnesses over here
who saw you use it.

36:06.211 --> 36:08.045
They didn't see it
because it didn't happen!

36:08.297 --> 36:11.674
- Shut them up!
- He's dead, but it didn't happen?

36:11.925 --> 36:15.303
<i>- Then who did it?
- Mustn't tell him, Stu.</i>

36:15.511 --> 36:17.931
- I don't know.
- You were the closest one to him.

36:18.140 --> 36:20.309
- You must've saw it happen. Help me.
- No.

36:20.559 --> 36:24.188
<i>- This guy is getting on my nerves.
- Look, stay the fuck out of this.</i>

36:24.436 --> 36:26.272
Who do you keep talking to
on the phone?

36:26.563 --> 36:29.441
- Nobody.
- Your friend, your parent, your lover?

36:29.691 --> 36:33.321
<i>- Who?
- Careful, Stuart. Careful.</i>

36:33.570 --> 36:35.489
My psychiatrist.

36:35.697 --> 36:39.951
<i>- Excellent. I should've thought of that.
- I see. What's this doctor's name?</i>

36:40.160 --> 36:42.162
It would be really helpful to us
if we knew.

36:42.538 --> 36:45.999
He says not to tell you, all right?
It's privileged information.

36:46.206 --> 36:48.459
<i>Very good, Stuart.
See, now you're having fun.</i>

36:48.708 --> 36:52.256
- Yeah, whatever you fucking say.
- I respect your right to privacy.

36:52.548 --> 36:56.008
I've been through therapy myself.
The department provided it for me.

36:56.258 --> 36:59.553
I know it's not good form for a cop
to be saying that, but sometimes...

36:59.762 --> 37:03.933
...you know, circumstances, stress...
I had issues. I lost my marriage over it.

37:04.434 --> 37:06.769
<i>Tell him not to come any closer.</i>

37:07.102 --> 37:09.979
Don't come any closer. Stop there.
Go back a few steps.

37:10.270 --> 37:12.356
- Go back to where you were!
- Okay. No problem.

37:12.606 --> 37:16.236
- That's right.
- So you got some intimacy issues.

37:16.486 --> 37:20.113
I got those too. All I want to know is,
what happened, man?

37:20.364 --> 37:24.159
<i>- Tell him to read you your rights.
- I want you to read me my rights.</i>

37:24.411 --> 37:26.079
Stop asking questions.

37:26.788 --> 37:29.913
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to an attorney.

37:30.248 --> 37:33.710
If you cannot afford one,
an attorney will be provided for you.

37:33.919 --> 37:37.463
All right? So now, can you at least
give me your first name?

37:37.714 --> 37:39.633
<i>- Just your first name.
- Don't tell him.</i>

37:39.883 --> 37:43.093
It's my right
not to have any first name.

37:44.220 --> 37:46.055
- No gun, no name.
- That's right.

37:46.264 --> 37:49.726
<i>- You're highly underprivileged.
- Demand your lawyer.</i>

37:49.935 --> 37:51.601
And go get my lawyer too. All right?

37:51.852 --> 37:54.814
I want an attorney brought
down here to negotiate my surrender.

37:55.063 --> 37:57.483
<i>- Just brilliant, Stu.
- I understand that, but...</i>

37:57.692 --> 38:00.903
...it's gonna be difficult to get a lawyer
to come and risk his life.

38:01.153 --> 38:03.404
- Once you hand over the gun...
- How can I?

38:03.613 --> 38:05.698
You won't let me put my hand
in my pocket?

38:05.990 --> 38:08.952
We'll take it out for you.
All you have to do...

38:09.160 --> 38:13.164
...is step out with your hands raised.
Nothing will happen to you.

38:13.371 --> 38:15.290
<i>- It's not gonna work.
- Stu, Stu.</i>

38:15.541 --> 38:16.959
<i>- What?
- Ask him a question.</i>

38:17.209 --> 38:20.005
<i>Ask him if his wife
got tired of sleeping with him.</i>

38:20.212 --> 38:24.633
<i>- I... Fuck. I can't do that.
- Oh, sure you can, Stu.</i>

38:24.842 --> 38:27.552
<i>Ask him if he couldn't get it up,
if he couldn't satisfy her.</i>

38:27.803 --> 38:30.431
- Are you gonna step out of the booth?
- I can't. No.

38:30.638 --> 38:34.267
<i>- You're not stepping out of the booth?
- Ask him.</i>

38:34.476 --> 38:37.770
<i>- Is that a no?
- Ask him!</i>

38:38.228 --> 38:40.773
<i>- Both your lives depend on it.
- Sir?</i>

38:41.025 --> 38:47.612
Captain, you couldn't satisfy your wife
sexually?

38:51.242 --> 38:54.204
<i>- Excuse me?
- Ask him if he abuses himself now?</i>

38:54.454 --> 38:57.330
<i>- Does he masturbate on lonely nights?
- Fuck. For God's sake!</i>

38:57.956 --> 38:59.624
<i>Say it!</i>

38:59.874 --> 39:03.337
<i>Say it or I will blow him away!</i>

39:05.047 --> 39:08.258
- So do you whack off now?
- Hey!

39:12.721 --> 39:14.890
I'm gonna see about
that lawyer for you, okay?

39:15.141 --> 39:18.516
- Yes.
- Just relax.

39:20.228 --> 39:23.856
<i>- Stu, I think you hurt his feelings.
- I wanna know who's on that phone.</i>

39:24.106 --> 39:28.444
I want a techie here. I need
to talk to somebody about that phone.

39:28.693 --> 39:31.904
<i>Do you think we went too far, Stuart?
Should we give ourselves up?</i>

39:32.114 --> 39:34.450
<i>Maybe I'd like someone
to negotiate my surrender.</i>

39:34.658 --> 39:38.036
<i>- I'm sure we can work that out.
- I won't just spill my guts to anyone.</i>

39:38.245 --> 39:42.248
<i>Could you get me national news?
I mean, you've got connections, right?</i>

39:42.498 --> 39:44.917
<i>- Sure.
- Could you get Larry King down here?</i>

39:45.167 --> 39:47.003
Why the fuck would Larry King
come here?

39:47.212 --> 39:50.923
<i>Because you're friends.
Who else could you get, huh?</i>

39:51.172 --> 39:54.134
<i>Could you get Tom Brokaw?
How about Dan Rather? Diane Sawyer?</i>

39:54.385 --> 39:57.846
<i>- Look, I, I, I don't know. They're busy.
- I, I, I busy.</i>

39:58.097 --> 40:01.057
<i>How about Mike Wallace? Ted Koppel?
Peter Jennings? Katie Couric?</i>

40:01.267 --> 40:04.977
<i>Al Roker? Anybody? No! Nobody.</i>

40:05.226 --> 40:09.107
<i>Face it, Stu, you're smalltime.
And you've got a credibility problem.</i>

40:09.357 --> 40:12.068
Don't fucking worry about
my credibility! All right?

40:12.360 --> 40:14.111
What about yours?

40:14.320 --> 40:19.409
<i>Look, it's our friends from channels
two and five. Your local news, Stuart.</i>

40:19.617 --> 40:22.495
<i>You couldn't do this for your clients
if your life depended on it.</i>

40:22.746 --> 40:25.079
<i>But me, I've made you famous.</i>

40:25.330 --> 40:28.290
<i>Stick your head out so they can get
a better angle on you.</i>

40:28.542 --> 40:31.419
<i>- They're here to cover me dying.
- How ungrateful.</i>

40:31.670 --> 40:33.838
<i>Those cameras will make the police
very careful.</i>

40:34.047 --> 40:37.676
<i>- So come on, smile a little for them.
- Can you tap into that phone call?</i>

40:37.925 --> 40:39.593
- Should be no problem.
- Except...

40:39.804 --> 40:43.347
...we'll need a warrant
if he's on the line with his shrink.

40:43.557 --> 40:46.933
Fuck that. I'm not gonna
jeopardize this on a technicality.

40:47.183 --> 40:49.269
Look, tracing,
that's not a violation, right?

40:49.520 --> 40:52.648
- As long as we don't listen in.
- Okay, this is what I want you to do.

40:52.857 --> 40:55.901
I want you to find who he's talking to
and their current location.

40:56.109 --> 40:58.278
All right? We get that?

40:58.486 --> 41:00.739
I want somebody to find out
what's going on.

41:01.072 --> 41:05.160
<i>Look across the street and see what
everybody in New York is looking at.</i>

41:05.410 --> 41:08.370
<i>You're the man, Stuart.
You're the center of attention.</i>

41:08.662 --> 41:13.084
<i>Wait till this goes national:
ABC, CBS, CNN, UPN...</i>

41:13.333 --> 41:15.669
<i>You're gonna hit
the whole alphabet, Stu.</i>

41:16.253 --> 41:17.922
I'll be forgotten about in a week.

41:18.130 --> 41:20.381
No one ever remembers
the names of the victims.

41:20.590 --> 41:24.303
It's the killers that get the cover
of "Time" magazine. Right?

41:24.512 --> 41:28.766
Think about it. You'd be famous.
Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy...

41:29.015 --> 41:31.642
...fucking Jeffrey Dahmer.
Name a victim. You can't.

41:31.851 --> 41:34.562
Anyway, I don't deserve
to be the center of attention.

41:34.813 --> 41:38.108
- It ought to be you they're covering.
"- That attention would embarrass me".

41:38.316 --> 41:42.027
<i>- I know exactly the spin to put on this.
- How terror inspires your creativity?</i>

41:42.236 --> 41:46.074
Listen, this could be a media frenzy,
all right? You'd get Barbara Walters...

41:46.325 --> 41:48.576
...I mean, Larry King
if you still wanted him.

41:48.826 --> 41:53.496
<i>That approach seems predicated upon
me surrendering without killing you.</i>

41:54.914 --> 41:58.835
Listen, we can make you sympathetic,
sit with a writer, bang out a book.

41:59.085 --> 42:03.423
You know, movie of the week.
Get America on your side.

42:03.673 --> 42:06.550
All right, you killed Leon
because he was gonna kill me.

42:06.758 --> 42:09.637
You killed Leon to protect me.
All right?

42:09.888 --> 42:12.848
In a city where nobody looks out
for anybody, you took a stand.

42:13.099 --> 42:14.349
I'm your best witness.

42:14.598 --> 42:17.727
<i>So you want me to trust you
to get me out of this?</i>

42:17.936 --> 42:21.065
Yes, I do. I want you to trust me.
Trust me.

42:21.314 --> 42:25.319
<i>Stu, you must think I'm crazy.</i>

42:35.744 --> 42:38.704
- Oh, shit. Here comes Braman.
- I'll take care of him.

42:40.124 --> 42:43.252
Hey. Should've waited for me
to initiate contact with the suspect.

42:43.504 --> 42:45.670
I established a rapport.
Let you know if I need help.

42:45.921 --> 42:47.672
Are you grandstanding for TV cameras?

42:47.964 --> 42:50.676
Or do you want to leave this
to a professional?

42:50.884 --> 42:53.388
Until a professional gets here,
I'll handle it.

42:53.680 --> 42:58.098
You're a funny guy. All right, you get
somebody else killed, it's on your head.

42:58.308 --> 43:00.392
Got it?

43:00.644 --> 43:03.604
This is what I want to do, okay?
This is the City Hotel here.

43:03.854 --> 43:07.858
I want three guys in the lobby here.
And five sharpshooters up here.

43:08.109 --> 43:10.111
See if you can get me two
in the subway.

43:12.112 --> 43:14.282
What the fuck?

43:15.073 --> 43:18.201
<i>- Not going to answer it?
- I can't. I can't reach for the phone.</i>

43:18.410 --> 43:20.746
<i>- The cops will think it's a gun.
- I'll bet it's Kelly.</i>

43:20.995 --> 43:23.415
<i>She's probably heard what you did.
She's sick with worry.</i>

43:23.666 --> 43:25.751
I'm not gonna make her
feel any better, am I?

43:25.959 --> 43:28.420
<i>Well, you could ask her
to forgive you, Stuart.</i>

43:28.670 --> 43:33.758
<i>You could confess your sins
and beg for absolution, come clean.</i>

43:34.007 --> 43:36.553
<i>You're in this position
because you're not telling the truth.</i>

43:36.803 --> 43:38.638
I'm in this position
because you got a gun!

43:38.847 --> 43:43.516
<i>No. Stuart, that is the sin of spin.
Avoidance and deception.</i>

43:43.725 --> 43:48.313
<i>You're being given a chance here
to make things right. Now, talk to her.</i>

43:48.522 --> 43:52.526
<i>- Look, I can't. Please.
- I am telling you to answer that phone!</i>

43:52.817 --> 43:55.696
- Excuse me! Excuse me!
- You can't cross in front of here!

43:55.988 --> 43:57.907
<i>Answer it!</i>

43:58.740 --> 44:01.617
<i>- Look, I can't. Please.
- Don't make me hurt you!</i>

44:01.910 --> 44:04.328
<i>- Talk to your wife!
- It's not her calling.</i>

44:04.577 --> 44:10.961
<i>- How can you be so sure?
- It's you. It's you, you miserable fuck!</i>

44:11.210 --> 44:14.922
<i>Damn, you got me!
You continue to impress.</i>

44:15.131 --> 44:17.298
You could shoot me,
but you want them to do it!

44:17.549 --> 44:19.218
<i>- Yes, well, that's an option.
- Yeah.</i>

44:19.468 --> 44:20.970
- Captain.
- Yeah?

44:21.219 --> 44:23.554
This lady says the perp's her husband.
Here's her ID.

44:23.847 --> 44:26.891
- I couldn't believe when I saw this.
- Who do you think he's talking to?

44:27.183 --> 44:32.563
I don't know. I spoke to him
earlier today and I told him...

44:32.812 --> 44:35.608
...that there was a man who called me.
- A man?

44:35.817 --> 44:38.235
Did this upset him, that
you were talking to other men?

44:38.485 --> 44:42.281
Yes, he did seem a little upset,
but it's, no... It's not like that.

44:42.531 --> 44:46.367
- I didn't even know who this guy was.
- Who's his psychiatrist?

44:46.660 --> 44:49.203
- He doesn't have one.
- That you know of.

44:49.452 --> 44:53.292
I've been with him three years, married for
one. I'd know if he was in therapy.

44:53.540 --> 44:56.336
I wish to God he had been.
I saw somebody after my divorce.

44:56.586 --> 44:59.462
It kept me from picking up a gun,
doing something I would regret.

44:59.756 --> 45:03.051
- Look, Stu didn't kill anyone.
- Ma'am, under the circumstances...

45:03.259 --> 45:06.719
...you need to consider whether your
husband is who you thought he was.

45:07.012 --> 45:09.973
'Cause according to these witnesses
over here, he has a gun...

45:10.182 --> 45:13.560
...he has used that gun and let's pray
to God that he doesn't use it again.

45:13.810 --> 45:14.938
Captain?

45:15.188 --> 45:18.899
If you can think of any dispute
he's having currently, please, tell me.

45:19.150 --> 45:23.404
We're clearing City Hotel. I can stage
an assault unit within feet of the booth.

45:23.653 --> 45:27.116
We've also got sharpshooters
securing rooftop positions.

45:27.324 --> 45:29.657
- Let me know when you're in position.
- Absolutely.

45:29.824 --> 45:31.160
What about that wire tap?

45:31.411 --> 45:34.373
We're working on it.
You gotta hold tight a while, all right?

45:34.581 --> 45:37.291
- Yeah, no problem. No problem.
- Okay.

45:40.835 --> 45:43.631
Mrs. Shepard. Mrs. Shepard.

45:43.839 --> 45:46.799
- Does he like being called Stuart or Stu?
- Stu. Call him Stu.

45:47.050 --> 45:48.886
Stu. Okay.

45:49.136 --> 45:51.304
Come with me, please.

45:54.765 --> 45:56.685
Stu.

45:57.018 --> 45:58.269
I have your wife with me.

45:58.563 --> 46:01.188
<i>That's how you knew
she wasn't calling. You deceived me.</i>

46:01.397 --> 46:03.232
- Stu!
- She's not my wife.

46:03.524 --> 46:05.776
Are you okay?

46:06.569 --> 46:09.196
<i>- Can you just talk to me?
- Yes, talk to her, Stu.</i>

46:09.447 --> 46:10.864
Look, she's not my wife!

46:11.699 --> 46:15.493
She's some fucked-up, failed actress
I wouldn't handle. She's stalking me!

46:15.744 --> 46:18.622
You aren't making this up?
You are his wife, right?

46:18.830 --> 46:22.459
Yes, here's a photograph of us
together.

46:22.709 --> 46:25.128
I don't know what he's talking about.

46:25.337 --> 46:28.047
Stu. Listen to your wife.

46:28.297 --> 46:30.717
- She only wants what's best for you.
- She's not my wife!

46:31.760 --> 46:34.720
Stu, nobody wants to hurt you.

46:34.928 --> 46:38.305
- We just want to know what happened.
- Yeah, very good.

46:38.515 --> 46:42.937
Go home, you fucking lunatic!
You hear me? Go home!

46:43.145 --> 46:45.939
Please don't make things worse.
Just come out.

46:46.189 --> 46:48.191
Just do what they tell you to do.

46:48.483 --> 46:51.193
<i>Your wife is a crazy actress stalker
and you don't know her.</i>

46:51.403 --> 46:54.032
<i>- That's an interesting match.
- Get her out of here!</i>

46:54.280 --> 46:57.491
- Enough. I don't want to agitate this.
- You out of your fucking mind?

46:57.741 --> 47:01.204
- Come on, get the woman out of here!
- No. I don't know what's going on.

47:01.413 --> 47:07.043
He's bleeding... We... We're fine.
This morning everything was fine.

47:07.250 --> 47:09.253
You just stay here.
Just stay here, okay?

47:09.502 --> 47:12.549
- Okay.
- I think she did some good.

47:12.756 --> 47:15.551
- You got a number of that lawyer?
- No, we don't have a lawyer.

47:15.843 --> 47:18.553
He asked for his lawyer to come
negotiate his surrender.

47:19.012 --> 47:22.556
- Well, we never needed one.
- Well, you need a good one now.

47:22.766 --> 47:26.310
Look, you'll do me best
by staying near here. Okay?

47:26.603 --> 47:28.437
I'm gonna get your husband out alive.

47:28.646 --> 47:31.941
- I'm not going to let you fuck this up!
- Get Mrs. Shepard out of here.

47:32.191 --> 47:34.360
You know, get her some coffee
or something.

47:34.651 --> 47:37.531
You're gonna lose this guy.
You need some kind of redemption.

47:37.738 --> 47:40.782
- What are you seeing a shrink for?
- Get the fuck out of my face!

47:40.990 --> 47:44.535
- Don't fucking touch me!
- I'm not stepping down!

47:44.744 --> 47:46.998
You okay?

47:47.664 --> 47:50.375
Yeah, I'm fine.

47:50.917 --> 47:53.418
<i>You'd think she didn't know
she was being watched.</i>

47:53.711 --> 47:57.174
<i>- What?
- But beautiful women always know.</i>

47:57.424 --> 48:01.051
<i>- You talking about Kelly?
- That false indifference, superior air...</i>

48:01.301 --> 48:04.763
<i>... it's just a tease.
They want eyes on them.</i>

48:04.971 --> 48:08.267
<i>Why does she put on her makeup,
do her hair, dress so nicely?</i>

48:08.516 --> 48:10.601
<i>Not for her husband
that she hardly ever sees.</i>

48:10.852 --> 48:13.814
<i>No, it's for somebody else to notice.
I notice.</i>

48:14.189 --> 48:16.649
What are you doing?
Stay away from her. Leave her alone.

48:16.900 --> 48:18.902
<i>I'm giving her what she wants.</i>

48:19.153 --> 48:23.155
<i>I bet you've never looked at Kelly
the way I am right now.</i>

48:25.324 --> 48:28.537
<i>- Don't you dare fucking hurt her.
- Don't I dare?</i>

48:28.787 --> 48:30.621
<i>I'm not the one
who has hurt her, Stuart.</i>

48:30.872 --> 48:33.665
<i>What they can't know is what we do
to them in our minds. Right?</i>

48:33.915 --> 48:36.876
<i>- You sick fuck!
- The perfect violation.</i>

48:39.004 --> 48:40.923
<i>- Leave her out of this.
- How many times...</i>

48:41.131 --> 48:45.885
<i>... have you had sex with Pam
in that hotel bedroom in your head?</i>

48:46.094 --> 48:49.805
<i>Would you really miss Kelly
if she was gone?</i>

48:50.265 --> 48:53.644
That's it. Not another word.
I'm not talking to you.

48:53.892 --> 48:55.978
<i>Your choices put other people
in jeopardy.</i>

48:56.186 --> 48:59.148
<i>When are you gonna learn that?</i>

48:59.439 --> 49:03.153
<i>This is funny. Stuart, look uptown.</i>

49:03.361 --> 49:07.072
<i>These geniuses are still
at the juncture box trying to tap in.</i>

49:07.280 --> 49:10.742
<i>Only I have installed an encryption
device at both ends of the line.</i>

49:10.950 --> 49:12.620
<i>There's no chance of a trap trace...</i>

49:12.828 --> 49:17.582
<i>... so now they've gotta try some fancy
LoJack instrument. It's really sad.</i>

49:17.832 --> 49:20.794
<i>I hope you weren't
pinning your hopes on those morons.</i>

49:21.042 --> 49:23.921
<i>Truth is, I'm on a wireless A.D.S.
With a cloned number.</i>

49:24.131 --> 49:28.216
<i>It'll take a half an hour to find out
I call forwarded through Philadelphia.</i>

49:28.425 --> 49:32.846
<i>And let me tell you, this will all be over
before they can get a dial tone.</i>

49:33.138 --> 49:36.516
We can't get a trace or break into the
line. It's like a ball of rubber bands.

49:36.768 --> 49:40.144
I knew there was something weird
about this. You keep working on it.

49:47.276 --> 49:50.570
<i>Stu. Stuart, come on,
you're behaving like a child.</i>

49:50.780 --> 49:52.531
<i>Still gonna give me
the silent treatment?</i>

49:52.781 --> 49:56.786
<i>Hello. Stuart, don't do this, please.
Come on.</i>

49:56.994 --> 49:59.622
<i>My sainted mother used to do this.
She used to dish this out.</i>

49:59.872 --> 50:02.332
<i>Stuart, please don't do this.</i>

50:02.582 --> 50:05.795
<i>Stuart, you're bringing back
my unhappy childhood.</i>

50:06.004 --> 50:11.173
<i>Stuart, talk to me! Please, talk to me!
I can't take it! Stu, please...</i>

50:12.092 --> 50:14.592
<i>I'm kidding.
I had a very happy childhood.</i>

50:14.845 --> 50:19.265
<i>Hey, there's our girl again.
I wasn't planning on killing her...</i>

50:19.515 --> 50:22.017
<i>... but plans change.</i>

50:22.894 --> 50:24.896
Just tell me
what the fuck you want from me.

50:25.105 --> 50:29.275
<i>Hello. There you are.
I thought I was talking to myself again.</i>

50:29.483 --> 50:31.987
Anything you want. I'll do it.
Just tell me.

50:32.237 --> 50:37.782
<i>Tell Kelly about the real Stu,
about your little motel.</i>

50:37.991 --> 50:42.246
<i>- And then you'll let us go?
- Why not?</i>

50:45.415 --> 50:47.334
<i>- Kelly!
- That's a start.</i>

50:47.542 --> 50:49.128
- Baby!
- Hold her back!

50:49.377 --> 50:50.628
- Hey!
- Talk to me!

50:50.879 --> 50:53.131
- Grab her! Keep her back!
- Yes?

50:53.382 --> 50:54.548
I'm listening.

50:56.132 --> 50:57.634
Kelly, I called some woman.

50:58.761 --> 51:01.097
<i>- Every day.
- Every day.</i>

51:01.305 --> 51:05.724
I was attracted to this other woman.
And I called her and...

51:05.977 --> 51:12.107
<i>- I wanted to fuck her.
- And I wanted to sleep with her.</i>

51:13.233 --> 51:18.695
<i>No. I wanted to fuck her.</i>

51:21.282 --> 51:27.079
<i>- Say it. Say it!
- And I wanted to fuck her.</i>

51:27.329 --> 51:33.378
- I'm sorry.
- Whatever you did, I don't care.

51:33.628 --> 51:36.839
Please, just come out of the booth.
Okay?

51:37.046 --> 51:41.633
That's all I did. That's all I did.
I'm sorry.

51:44.304 --> 51:47.848
All right, I've done what you asked.
That's it. I've had enough of this.

51:48.182 --> 51:50.268
<i>I haven't.</i>

51:50.518 --> 51:55.607
<i>- You said you'd let us go.
- I changed my mind.</i>

51:55.982 --> 51:58.858
You miserable fuck. You can't do this.
You can't do this to me.

51:59.109 --> 52:02.570
Look, I took all your shit.
I did everything you fucking asked.

52:02.821 --> 52:04.322
You lied to me.
I'm done with this.

52:04.530 --> 52:08.702
I've fucking had enough.
You can go fuck yourself! Later.

52:09.119 --> 52:11.370
- He hung up.
- Maybe they already got a trace.

52:11.622 --> 52:14.249
ESU, ESU?

52:17.836 --> 52:19.671
- I'm giving myself up!
- He's coming out!

52:19.879 --> 52:22.423
- Heads up!
- I want to see you toss away your weapon!

52:22.839 --> 52:25.466
Throw the weapon outside the booth!
Stay where you are!

52:26.051 --> 52:28.930
- First, the weapon!
- Don't hurt him! Please, don't hurt him!

52:29.178 --> 52:31.682
- There's no fucking gun!
- Stay right where you are!

52:31.933 --> 52:36.686
I want you to turn around. Interlock
your fingers behind your head. Okay?

52:38.397 --> 52:42.026
- Please give them the gun!
- Kelly, no!

52:42.818 --> 52:45.527
Get back! Kelly!

52:46.571 --> 52:48.489
- Freeze!
- Get back! Get back!

52:48.740 --> 52:50.575
- Get back!
- Okay! Okay!

52:53.452 --> 52:54.787
I gotta answer it.

52:55.080 --> 52:56.914
Freeze! Don't move.

52:57.579 --> 52:59.415
Hold your fire!

53:00.960 --> 53:03.378
Hold your fire!

53:03.796 --> 53:06.048
Hold your fire.

53:08.091 --> 53:11.302
- Hold. Hold.
- Please.

53:12.303 --> 53:15.431
- Go ahead. Answer it.
- What the fuck are you doing?

53:15.682 --> 53:17.433
He's coming out!

53:18.059 --> 53:19.308
Answer the phone.

53:24.356 --> 53:26.900
<i>- You fucking coward.
- Hi, Stu.</i>

53:27.151 --> 53:30.945
<i>Now, you've had your little tantrum
and you said some things in anger...</i>

53:31.195 --> 53:33.363
<i>... that I am willing to forget.</i>

53:34.783 --> 53:37.202
Get her back in the car!
I want her in the car.

53:37.451 --> 53:40.163
If he's not the shooter,
then who the fuck is?

53:44.043 --> 53:46.295
Captain, what the fuck
is up with the phone calls?

53:46.585 --> 53:48.171
<i>- So can we start over?
- You lied.</i>

53:48.380 --> 53:51.590
<i>You can't know the pain of betrayal
until you've been betrayed.</i>

53:51.839 --> 53:54.551
Sniper in one of these buildings.
I want you to talk to ESU.

53:54.760 --> 53:57.096
I want you to get one of these guys,
this building.

53:57.346 --> 54:01.682
Start looking up there from window
to window till you find the perp. Okay?

54:01.891 --> 54:05.813
I want you to do it quickly, and
I want you to do it quietly. All right?

54:08.023 --> 54:09.357
Where's the ESU sergeant?

54:09.732 --> 54:11.067
You said we could go.

54:11.359 --> 54:13.361
<i>- You said you'd let us go.
- Relax, Stuart.</i>

54:13.609 --> 54:15.529
<i>Nobody gets it right the first time.</i>

54:15.738 --> 54:19.199
<i>You've done better than others.
You will get a chance to end this.</i>

54:19.450 --> 54:21.869
<i>- I'm just not finished yet.
- Yeah, well, I am.</i>

54:22.119 --> 54:24.288
<i>- There's nothing keeping me.
- Besides the fear of death?</i>

54:24.495 --> 54:26.831
I dive out and you've got one shot.
I'm gonna be dancing.

54:27.041 --> 54:30.419
<i>- You think you can get me?
- I could go for some target practice.</i>

54:30.669 --> 54:33.212
One shot, they look for you.
Second shot, you give yourself away.

54:33.463 --> 54:35.298
<i>Go on, Stuart, hang up!</i>

54:35.548 --> 54:38.676
<i>Trust your fate to friendly men in flak
jackets with automatic weapons.</i>

54:39.218 --> 54:43.222
<i>I'm sure you can patch up that little
misunderstanding about the dead body.</i>

54:43.431 --> 54:45.849
<i>- Cops can't prove I killed anyone.
- You had motive.</i>

54:46.058 --> 54:48.478
<i>- No weapon.
- Plenty of loudmouth witnesses.</i>

54:48.728 --> 54:49.854
No gun and I walk.

54:50.105 --> 54:51.939
<i>- Are you sure?
- Yes!</i>

54:52.148 --> 54:56.401
<i>Yeah? You murder a guy and you
forget where you stashed your gun?</i>

54:56.610 --> 54:59.572
<i>Why don't you lift the
plastic ceiling panel and feel around?</i>

55:02.073 --> 55:04.159
<i>Peekaboo!</i>

55:09.539 --> 55:12.917
<i>What's up next to the florescent bulb?
Check it out, Stu.</i>

55:13.167 --> 55:15.626
Cops see me reach for something,
they'll blow me away.

55:15.918 --> 55:17.420
<i>There's only one way to find out.</i>

55:17.671 --> 55:21.216
Look, the slugs in that dead guy,
they came from your rifle.

55:21.425 --> 55:24.302
They're not gonna match a handgun.
I've seen enough cop shows.

55:24.511 --> 55:27.722
<i>Hollow points fragment on impact,
Stuart. There's nothing to match.</i>

55:27.972 --> 55:30.601
<i>- Only there's no gun up there.
- Don't take my word for it.</i>

55:30.809 --> 55:34.813
<i>See for yourself.
There are rounds left in it.</i>

55:35.104 --> 55:37.899
<i>- I totally couldn't give a shit.
- Come on. Don't disappoint me.</i>

55:38.149 --> 55:41.610
<i>Use your imagination. You'd shoot me
if you got the chance, wouldn't you?</i>

55:41.860 --> 55:44.907
With a big fucking smile on my face.

55:45.114 --> 55:47.533
<i>There's the spirit.</i>

55:47.784 --> 55:51.244
<i>Now, what if I told you I was just
above the theater, four floors up?</i>

55:51.453 --> 55:54.081
<i>See the pink curtains?</i>

55:54.415 --> 55:56.834
<i>There you go, Stuart. Yes.</i>

55:57.085 --> 55:58.669
<i>Yoo-hoo!</i>

55:58.878 --> 56:01.294
<i>Yoo-hoo!</i>

56:05.299 --> 56:07.052
Why would you do that?

56:07.301 --> 56:11.890
<i>Because it's fun.
The odds are even now, Stuart.</i>

56:12.181 --> 56:13.933
<i>Isn't that what you wanted?</i>

56:14.225 --> 56:16.769
<i>You know where I am,
and you have a gun.</i>

56:17.020 --> 56:21.355
<i>If you have it in you,
you can take me down.</i>

56:23.524 --> 56:24.860
Fuck!

56:25.068 --> 56:29.156
<i>- They'd kill me before I got a shot.
- Oh, you're probably right.</i>

56:29.406 --> 56:30.740
<i>I'm not really there anyway.</i>

56:31.033 --> 56:34.828
<i>You would've just spoiled
some nice lady's curtains.</i>

56:38.540 --> 56:41.751
<i>Looks like someone watches the news.</i>

56:43.210 --> 56:46.838
<i>- Who?
- The motel.</i>

56:48.841 --> 56:51.718
<i>- Oh, God.
- I think she could use a new headshot.</i>

56:51.927 --> 56:54.179
<i>- Don't!
- Then take down the gun.</i>

56:54.470 --> 56:58.183
<i>- Look, this has nothing to do with her!
- She has everything to do with this.</i>

56:58.391 --> 57:00.937
<i>You're here and she's here
because you called her.</i>

57:01.186 --> 57:05.439
<i>Now, take it down!
Don't make me hurt Pam, Stuart.</i>

57:05.730 --> 57:07.899
<i>- Take down the gun!
- Hey, everybody, get ready.</i>

57:08.150 --> 57:10.862
Hold on, hold on.
Let's just see what he does, all right?

57:11.153 --> 57:12.406
Let's see what he's doing.

57:16.866 --> 57:18.119
There's nothing there.

57:18.369 --> 57:22.081
<i>Nothing but your fingerprints on the
finest cop killer money can buy.</i>

57:22.332 --> 57:26.208
<i>- Come on, Stu. Let's see it.
- Fuck, no! It's staying there.</i>

57:26.459 --> 57:28.544
<i>Fine, then someone
will have to take your place.</i>

57:28.793 --> 57:31.045
<i>Come on, Stu,
you're in a perfect position.</i>

57:31.339 --> 57:33.840
<i>- How do you figure?
- You get to choose between them.</i>

57:34.133 --> 57:38.553
<i>Pamela or Kelly? Should I choose?
One of them can take your place.</i>

57:38.846 --> 57:40.514
Don't do this!

57:40.722 --> 57:44.520
<i>You've got to be more in touch with your
feelings. I thought you only loved Kelly!</i>

57:44.727 --> 57:46.647
<i>- It's true!
- But you lie to her.</i>

57:46.854 --> 57:48.188
It's complicated.

57:48.438 --> 57:51.983
<i>Then I'll uncomplicate it, Stuart,
by removing temptation. I say Pam.</i>

57:52.192 --> 57:54.819
No! Look, this isn't Pam's fault.
This is all my fault!

57:55.028 --> 57:56.280
She's innocent!

57:57.363 --> 58:01.702
<i>Ticktock, ticktock.
Time's running out. Okay, Kelly, then.</i>

58:01.951 --> 58:03.284
<i>- You decide.
- No, please!</i>

58:03.537 --> 58:06.165
<i>Come on, Stu.
Don't you get the game yet?</i>

58:06.414 --> 58:09.292
<i>You're a selfish guy.
Pick one and save yourself.</i>

58:10.249 --> 58:12.669
<i>Blond or brunette? Time's running out.</i>

58:12.918 --> 58:16.716
<i>You or them? Kelly or Pam?
Kelly or Pam?</i>

58:16.924 --> 58:19.092
Come on, Stu!

58:19.343 --> 58:21.594
Stop this.

58:21.886 --> 58:25.013
<i>- I can't take this anymore.
- What are you doing? Get up!</i>

58:25.223 --> 58:27.935
<i>- I was looking for my ring. Look...
- Get up, Stuart!</i>

58:28.143 --> 58:32.479
<i>Stand up and be a man.
You're embarrassing yourself.</i>

58:35.482 --> 58:36.817
Captain! I got it. Listen.

58:37.026 --> 58:41.780
The rifleman reports subject pulled
a small, dark object out of his pocket.

58:42.072 --> 58:44.950
All right. You're looking at a suicide
on national fucking TV.

58:45.201 --> 58:46.953
You gonna let me take this over?

58:47.202 --> 58:49.372
Tell everybody to hold on,
to hold their fire.

58:49.623 --> 58:52.750
Everybody hold. Stay ready, but hold.

58:53.540 --> 58:58.128
<i>- Stuart, you're beginning to annoy me.
- You can't do this.</i>

58:58.379 --> 59:02.383
<i>Stu.
No more spinning, no more excuses.</i>

59:04.385 --> 59:07.428
What're you doing? Look, listen.
Listen, please listen to me.

59:07.637 --> 59:08.890
<i>No more delays, Stuart.</i>

59:09.140 --> 59:11.601
Look... I'm on my knees
begging you not to kill me.

59:11.851 --> 59:14.187
<i>I will if you keep up
this pathetic spectacle.</i>

59:14.437 --> 59:16.354
Excuse me! He's on the phone, talking.

59:16.563 --> 59:18.982
From up in your high window,
you could kill anyone.

59:19.231 --> 59:22.027
<i>- Yes, I know that, Stuart.
- All right, and...</i>

59:22.236 --> 59:24.653
You could pick off any of the cops,
with your rifle.

59:24.862 --> 59:26.531
<i>Shut up and stand up!</i>

59:26.739 --> 59:28.742
Look, why threaten Kelly?

59:28.909 --> 59:31.369
You liked how she sounded
on the phone at the store.

59:31.619 --> 59:34.080
Please don't hurt her.
Don't fucking hurt my wife.

59:34.331 --> 59:37.207
<i>This doesn't have to end with me
shooting you. You leave no choice.</i>

59:37.415 --> 59:40.211
<i>- Now, get up!
- All right.</i>

59:40.669 --> 59:44.298
Okay, how does this end?
Tell me how this ends.

59:44.505 --> 59:46.259
<i>The stage is almost set.</i>

59:46.507 --> 59:49.719
<i>People are gonna be eating dinner
watching you die.</i>

59:50.054 --> 59:53.098
We got a sniper situation here.

59:53.432 --> 59:55.268
What about that phone call
to your store?

59:55.475 --> 59:58.518
I got a phone call this afternoon.
I think it was a prank call.

59:58.810 --> 01:00:01.439
He told me Stu would be calling me
from a phone booth.

01:00:01.729 --> 01:00:03.899
How long will it take
to get a record of her calls?

01:00:04.107 --> 01:00:06.902
If he's using that secure line,
we won't know more than now.

01:00:07.153 --> 01:00:10.864
Say he didn't. Let's assume he's
a human, makes mistakes like all of us.

01:00:11.115 --> 01:00:14.244
I need to get that number.
I've been waiting for that number.

01:00:14.494 --> 01:00:17.538
It was a guy.
He sounded like mid-30's.

01:00:17.788 --> 01:00:21.415
Mrs. Shepard? It would be safer
if you got back in the car, okay?

01:00:21.664 --> 01:00:23.500
- Please get back in the car.
- Thank you.

01:00:23.707 --> 01:00:27.255
I want you to divert incoming ESU
units to Broadway and hold them there.

01:00:27.464 --> 01:00:29.550
- Want me to clear the streets?
- Yeah.

01:00:29.758 --> 01:00:33.218
No, no, no. I don't want the sniper
to be aware of any of our movements.

01:00:33.469 --> 01:00:35.053
He's already got position on us.

01:00:35.305 --> 01:00:37.723
Let's not let him know
we know too much, okay?

01:00:38.641 --> 01:00:40.476
- Hey, Jonah.
- Yeah.

01:00:40.726 --> 01:00:42.226
Don't look up.

01:00:45.229 --> 01:00:47.399
Get me sharpshooters
looking at those windows.

01:00:47.649 --> 01:00:50.151
- You got it, captain.
- I'm gonna buy us some time here.

01:00:50.402 --> 01:00:51.902
All right.

01:00:58.452 --> 01:01:01.495
Stu! It's okay if I come out
and talk to you for a second?

01:01:01.747 --> 01:01:03.498
<i>- I don't know.
- This guy is so lonely.</i>

01:01:04.331 --> 01:01:08.126
<i>- All he wants to do is talk.
- You're walking through a bad dream...</i>

01:01:08.334 --> 01:01:11.296
<i>...and you can't wake up.
- Now he's really testing my patience.</i>

01:01:11.505 --> 01:01:13.507
You wanna wake up, Stu?

01:01:13.715 --> 01:01:18.720
I wanna, but I got issues
I can't talk about.

01:01:18.927 --> 01:01:23.850
- That your psychiatrist on the phone?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm paying him overtime.

01:01:24.142 --> 01:01:27.101
That was pretty brave what you did.

01:01:27.769 --> 01:01:30.564
I mean,
admitting all that stuff to your wife.

01:01:30.773 --> 01:01:34.234
- It was liberating, right?
- Should've been.

01:01:34.444 --> 01:01:37.487
Maybe if I could be more honest
with my wife then...

01:01:37.654 --> 01:01:40.282
...I don't know,
something would've turned out different.

01:01:40.532 --> 01:01:42.201
<i>Oh, please.</i>

01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:46.120
- Trust is the key. You trust me, Stu?
"- Get this man a seat on" Oprah.

01:01:46.329 --> 01:01:50.165
I wanna, but I got the issues
I can't talk about.

01:01:50.415 --> 01:01:52.751
<i>Yes, lethal issues.
Tell him to stay back.</i>

01:01:53.003 --> 01:01:55.005
Look, don't come any closer.

01:01:55.254 --> 01:01:57.882
Hey, I don't wanna cause
or make anything harder for you.

01:01:58.132 --> 01:02:01.760
<i>Pam, Ramey, Kelly, people on the
street, you've got lives in your hands.</i>

01:02:02.136 --> 01:02:05.181
I told you it's a private conversation.
What the fuck do you want?

01:02:05.473 --> 01:02:08.933
I wanna let you know that it's safe
outside the booth.

01:02:09.184 --> 01:02:11.352
<i>- It's not.
- It's always, "Get out of the booth! "</i>

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:14.355
I like it in the fucking booth!
All right? It's my world.

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:16.983
This is my booth, and
I'm not coming out. All right?

01:02:17.275 --> 01:02:19.027
- Never.
- We're not gonna force you out...

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:21.822
...because there could be
some miscalculation...

01:02:21.987 --> 01:02:25.201
...and then I would never find out
why this happened.

01:02:25.951 --> 01:02:31.663
Stu, I'm afraid. I'm afraid
that I'm gonna be standing by...

01:02:31.871 --> 01:02:35.792
...and my men are gonna shoot
some guy...

01:02:36.042 --> 01:02:42.342
...and when we find out what's in his
hand, once we turn over his body...

01:02:42.591 --> 01:02:45.093
...and we see what he was
threatening people with...

01:02:45.302 --> 01:02:48.680
We realize that it was just
a little black Bible.

01:02:49.222 --> 01:02:53.017
<i>- Or a cell phone.
- Don't push me, Stu.</i>

01:02:56.437 --> 01:02:58.105
I'm not gonna let that happen here.

01:02:58.647 --> 01:03:00.732
I wanted to make a phone call.
One lousy call...

01:03:00.983 --> 01:03:02.985
<i>That's enough, Stu.</i>

01:03:03.236 --> 01:03:07.490
- You got some bad news on that call?
- The worst.

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:09.700
I bet you want to jump off the edge.

01:03:10.951 --> 01:03:13.579
<i>- I've been falling ever since.
- I'm gonna push him over the edge.</i>

01:03:13.828 --> 01:03:15.329
<i>Just say the word.</i>

01:03:15.538 --> 01:03:16.956
It's time to land.

01:03:17.456 --> 01:03:20.834
- When you hit bottom, you die.
- I'm your safety net.

01:03:21.043 --> 01:03:24.005
<i>Oh, please, say the word.</i>

01:03:24.255 --> 01:03:27.466
If I tell you what you wanna know,
you'll die too.

01:03:27.715 --> 01:03:29.885
<i>Exactly.</i>

01:03:32.846 --> 01:03:34.516
- I'm going.
- Good.

01:03:36.558 --> 01:03:39.768
But, Stu, we put a call out
to your lawyer.

01:03:40.019 --> 01:03:42.105
Your wife, she gave us the number.

01:03:43.441 --> 01:03:50.029
And I got my best men working
on bringing him down. Okay?

01:03:50.863 --> 01:03:52.783
<i>That's it. The captain gets a bullet.</i>

01:03:53.324 --> 01:03:54.743
Get out of here!
Hear what I said, asshole?

01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:59.036
<i>- Get out of here, go on, now! Go!
- Enough of this sideshow, Stu.</i>

01:03:59.287 --> 01:04:03.291
<i>- Your sins have caught up to you.
- So this is all some religious thing?</i>

01:04:03.458 --> 01:04:06.919
<i>That explains it. Bible-crazed killer
picks on fashion-obsessed PR guy.</i>

01:04:07.170 --> 01:04:09.591
<i>- Tell me what you want, then.
- What everyone wants...</i>

01:04:09.799 --> 01:04:12.049
<i>... for the bad guy
to get what he deserves.</i>

01:04:12.258 --> 01:04:14.344
<i>Go for the gun.</i>

01:04:14.595 --> 01:04:16.679
<i>- Kill myself?
- Yes.</i>

01:04:16.888 --> 01:04:19.057
It would be a rare, unselfish act.

01:04:23.768 --> 01:04:26.396
- We got hostile action.
- Nothing is hostile until I say it is.

01:04:27.106 --> 01:04:29.441
<i>- Look, I can't find it.
- Kelly, Pam, bam! Bam!</i>

01:04:29.650 --> 01:04:31.735
All right! Look, I found it. I got it.

01:04:31.986 --> 01:04:35.030
<i>- Then let's see it. Let everyone see it.
- The cops'll kill me.</i>

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:38.743
<i>Yes.
You're talking prime-time material now.</i>

01:04:38.993 --> 01:04:40.828
<i>- All this shit just to watch me die?
- No.</i>

01:04:41.078 --> 01:04:46.248
<i>To get you to do what's right.
If you wanna save yourself, confess.</i>

01:04:46.499 --> 01:04:48.960
<i>- I already told Kelly everything.
- Everything?</i>

01:04:49.209 --> 01:04:52.170
<i>No. No more excuses
and half-truths, Stuart.</i>

01:04:52.421 --> 01:04:56.216
<i>You look out into those cameras
and you bare your soul.</i>

01:04:56.466 --> 01:04:59.096
<i>TV seems to help bring out
the worst in people.</i>

01:04:59.345 --> 01:05:01.014
<i>You should be fine.</i>

01:05:01.263 --> 01:05:04.641
- How're those techs doing? Anything?
- No, not yet. Not yet.

01:05:04.933 --> 01:05:09.354
We haven't found your lawyer yet,
Stu. But we're getting close. Okay?

01:05:09.562 --> 01:05:13.733
<i>Stuart, I'm offering you a chance
to redeem yourself.</i>

01:05:14.067 --> 01:05:16.611
<i>Come on, humble yourself
in front of your loved ones...</i>

01:05:16.861 --> 01:05:21.283
<i>... and millions of strangers and me.
It's do-or-die time.</i>

01:05:21.531 --> 01:05:23.618
What, you couldn't find anyone
worse than me?

01:05:23.868 --> 01:05:26.828
Not a murderer or a child molester
but a publicist...

01:05:27.036 --> 01:05:29.371
...who has fantasies
about pretty little actresses.

01:05:29.832 --> 01:05:32.252
Who spends money on Italian suits
and dry cleaning...

01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:35.795
...so people think he's important.
Who doesn't waste time being nice...

01:05:36.046 --> 01:05:38.381
...to people who are of no use to him.
These are my crimes?

01:05:38.547 --> 01:05:43.636
<i>Stuart, I know your crimes. Tell them.</i>

01:06:07.701 --> 01:06:10.119
I've never done anything for anybody...

01:06:10.410 --> 01:06:12.913
...who couldn't do something for me.
I string along...

01:06:13.205 --> 01:06:16.334
...a kid with promises
that I'll pay him money.

01:06:16.584 --> 01:06:18.670
I keep him around because he
looks up to me.

01:06:18.837 --> 01:06:23.091
Adam, if you're watching, don't be
a publicist. You're too good for it.

01:06:23.258 --> 01:06:29.221
I lie in person and on the phone.
I lie to my friends.

01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:33.599
I lie to newspapers and magazines who
sell my lies to more and more people.

01:06:33.808 --> 01:06:39.105
I'm just a part of a big cycle of lies.
I should be fucking president.

01:06:39.355 --> 01:06:43.859
I wear all this Italian shit because
underneath, I still feel like the Bronx.

01:06:44.151 --> 01:06:46.696
I think I need these clothes,
and this watch.

01:06:46.987 --> 01:06:51.660
My $2000 watch is a fake,
and so am I.

01:06:52.032 --> 01:06:54.912
I neglected the things
I should've valued most.

01:06:55.203 --> 01:06:56.954
I valued this shit.

01:06:57.998 --> 01:07:04.296
I take off my wedding ring to call Pam.
Kelly, that's Pam.

01:07:06.088 --> 01:07:08.342
- Somebody got a 20 on this Pam?
- Don't blame her.

01:07:08.592 --> 01:07:10.844
I never told her if I was married,
and if I did...

01:07:11.094 --> 01:07:12.763
...she would've told me to go home.

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:19.016
Kelly, looking at you now,
I'm ashamed of myself.

01:07:20.895 --> 01:07:26.775
I mean, I work so hard on this image,
on Stu Shepard, the asshole...

01:07:26.983 --> 01:07:31.906
...who refers to himself in third person,
that I only proved I should be alone.

01:07:32.991 --> 01:07:36.785
I've been dressing up as something
I'm not for so long...

01:07:37.035 --> 01:07:40.663
...I'm so afraid you won't like what's
underneath.

01:07:40.872 --> 01:07:46.003
But here I am.
I'm just flesh and blood and weakness.

01:07:48.504 --> 01:07:50.255
I love you so fucking much.

01:07:56.553 --> 01:08:02.016
I take off this ring because it only
reminds me of how I've failed you.

01:08:02.265 --> 01:08:05.146
And, I don't wanna give you up.

01:08:05.354 --> 01:08:09.440
I wanna make things better,
but it may not be my choice anymore.

01:08:10.274 --> 01:08:12.819
You deserve better.

01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:31.627
<i>- You're not gonna let me go.
- No.</i>

01:08:31.837 --> 01:08:35.631
You never were.
I know a thing about lies.

01:08:35.841 --> 01:08:37.759
I know a thing or two
about liars as well.

01:08:37.968 --> 01:08:40.676
<i>Then why the confession?</i>

01:08:46.768 --> 01:08:49.185
I didn't do it for you.

01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:53.023
- Right there.
- Yeah, got that.

01:08:53.273 --> 01:08:57.194
Captain, captain. The call to his wife
originated at 2: 17...

01:08:57.444 --> 01:08:59.779
...at a hard line from the old
Barkley Hotel.

01:08:59.988 --> 01:09:02.158
- You got a room?
- 604.

01:09:02.613 --> 01:09:05.158
Second window from the corner.
ESU units holding.

01:09:05.785 --> 01:09:07.285
Bring them in from 52nd Street.

01:09:07.537 --> 01:09:10.913
Cover the windows, doors, fire escape,
every goddamn point of exit.

01:09:11.165 --> 01:09:13.960
- ESU, ESU, come in from the 52nd...
- Stu!

01:09:14.251 --> 01:09:16.877
- Your lawyer's coming down now!
- Doors, fire escapes...

01:09:17.129 --> 01:09:18.381
Now!

01:09:19.131 --> 01:09:21.384
<i>At least you'll die
with a clean conscience.</i>

01:09:21.593 --> 01:09:24.886
No, you're the one that's gonna die!
Listen, you can hear them now.

01:09:25.136 --> 01:09:26.804
They're coming to get you. Know why?

01:09:27.013 --> 01:09:29.348
<i>- Because I sent them!
- You can't stop lying, can you?</i>

01:09:29.599 --> 01:09:31.684
I can't stop lying?
They're coming up the stairs.

01:09:31.892 --> 01:09:33.562
They're coming to get you.
Look around.

01:09:33.810 --> 01:09:35.647
That room's getting smaller
every second.

01:09:35.897 --> 01:09:37.229
Inch by inch! You know what?

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:40.234
It's not gonna be any bigger
than this fucking goddamn booth!

01:09:40.527 --> 01:09:43.029
- They're in position, in position.
- Get them to move!

01:09:49.702 --> 01:09:51.537
<i>- There's nobody there.
- There's nobody there?</i>

01:09:51.746 --> 01:09:54.539
They're coming through that fucking
door to put you out of your misery.

01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:57.251
You got a couple seconds left.
What're you gonna do?

01:09:57.501 --> 01:10:00.127
<i>If this is true, I have to take someone
with me, don't I?</i>

01:10:00.377 --> 01:10:03.757
<i>Since Kelly is the most important thing
in your life, I'll take her.</i>

01:10:04.006 --> 01:10:06.468
Then take me! Take me.
This is about me!

01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:09.886
I'm the fucking one you want!
Take me!

01:10:10.095 --> 01:10:12.598
This is about me! Come on!

01:10:12.890 --> 01:10:14.809
Take me! It's me you want!

01:10:51.383 --> 01:10:53.552
This is Captain Ramey.
Somebody talk to me.

01:10:53.845 --> 01:10:55.847
<i>We're too late.
The psycho heard us coming...</i>

01:10:56.097 --> 01:10:58.017
<i>... and slashed his throat
with a knife.</i>

01:10:58.224 --> 01:11:01.603
<i>- What's his condition?
- Critical. He's lost a lot of blood.</i>

01:11:01.811 --> 01:11:04.230
Get him down here.
I don't want nobody dying on me.

01:11:04.437 --> 01:11:05.857
All right.

01:11:07.026 --> 01:11:09.444
- Kelly, where's Kelly?
- Your wife's fine, all right?

01:11:09.694 --> 01:11:11.529
All right, try not to sit up.

01:11:13.571 --> 01:11:15.740
- What hit me?
- Rubber bullet.

01:11:15.949 --> 01:11:18.994
Figured if somebody's gonna
shoot you, it might as well be us.

01:11:19.245 --> 01:11:21.330
Thanks.

01:11:21.663 --> 01:11:23.664
- Did you get him?
- You did.

01:11:24.167 --> 01:11:26.627
- I didn't do anything.
- Give yourself some credit.

01:11:26.876 --> 01:11:30.255
Got yourself out alive.
Doesn't always happen that way.

01:11:33.549 --> 01:11:35.217
- Are you okay?
- It's okay. I'm okay.

01:11:35.467 --> 01:11:37.636
God. I was so afraid.

01:11:37.886 --> 01:11:40.222
I thought I wasn't ever
gonna see you again.

01:11:40.431 --> 01:11:42.182
Me too.

01:11:42.433 --> 01:11:43.935
We've got things to talk about.

01:11:44.476 --> 01:11:46.644
I only want to talk about
what you want to tell me.

01:11:46.895 --> 01:11:50.983
I want to tell you everything.
Everything.

01:11:52.150 --> 01:11:54.404
Get that gurney over here.
Get over here.

01:11:54.611 --> 01:11:56.528
We lost him.

01:11:58.822 --> 01:12:00.325
- I want to stand up.
- I got him.

01:12:00.574 --> 01:12:02.576
- Sure you can hold on?
- I gotta see him.

01:12:02.784 --> 01:12:04.870
- You don't want to see this.
- Yes, I do.

01:12:05.078 --> 01:12:06.663
- Take it easy.
- Yes, I do.

01:12:06.914 --> 01:12:10.126
- Allow me. Allow me.
- Go ahead.

01:12:15.881 --> 01:12:18.299
You recognize him?

01:12:18.508 --> 01:12:21.469
Yeah. He was down here trying
to deliver me a pizza...

01:12:21.718 --> 01:12:23.804
...10 minutes before I got the call.

01:12:24.013 --> 01:12:26.432
I told him to fuck off.

01:12:26.642 --> 01:12:28.225
That's enough these days.

01:12:33.605 --> 01:12:35.775
Just give it a minute.

01:12:35.983 --> 01:12:38.153
We'll be driving,
and you'll be flying.

01:12:38.361 --> 01:12:40.613
Whatever you say.

01:12:43.906 --> 01:12:46.619
What a piece of shit.

01:13:15.603 --> 01:13:17.689
Nice shoes.

01:13:22.193 --> 01:13:24.111
Italian.

01:13:26.322 --> 01:13:29.116
You hung up, Stu.

01:13:29.325 --> 01:13:31.952
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

01:13:33.705 --> 01:13:36.497
I feel bad about the pizza guy.

01:13:37.082 --> 01:13:40.378
But I couldn't miss seeing
you and Kelly reunited.

01:13:40.629 --> 01:13:43.506
You don't have to thank me.
Nobody ever does.

01:13:43.756 --> 01:13:47.383
I just hope
your newfound honesty lasts.

01:13:47.592 --> 01:13:52.181
Because it if doesn't,
you'll be hearing from me.

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:22.792
<i>Isn't it funny?</i>

01:14:23.043 --> 01:14:27.462
<i>You hear a phone ring,
and it could be anybody.</i>

01:14:28.173 --> 01:14:32.592
<i>But a ringing phone
has to be answered, doesn't it?</i>

01:14:34.678 --> 01:14:37.139
<i>Doesn't it?</i>

01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:02.079
Hello?
