00:00.600 --> 00:02.634
Welcome back to <i>tool time.</i>

00:02.635 --> 00:04.970
Now, when selecting your wood
for your deck,

00:04.971 --> 00:06.971
You want to use cedar
or redwood,

00:06.973 --> 00:09.507
'cause they won't rot or decay
from the moisture.

00:09.508 --> 00:12.811
And it's also why poplar
is quite "pop'lar."

00:18.951 --> 00:20.919
And once you finish
that deck,

00:20.920 --> 00:22.887
You've got
your springtime there.

00:22.888 --> 00:25.090
It's spring, klaus.
How about some springtime?

00:25.091 --> 00:28.126
<i>(birds chirping/</i>
<i>tim sighs)</i>

00:28.127 --> 00:31.062
It's spring, nice weather,
the birds...

00:31.063 --> 00:33.865
Hey, hey, hey!

00:33.866 --> 00:36.367
Get your deck finished,
you just kick back,

00:36.368 --> 00:39.370
Enjoy the fruits
of your labor, right, al?

00:39.371 --> 00:40.739
I wouldn't know, tim.

00:40.740 --> 00:43.642
You're fruiting,
I'm still laboring.

00:43.643 --> 00:47.578
Anyway, al, as you can see,
is bracing and blocking
in between the joist here.

00:47.579 --> 00:51.016
That's right,
and if you use
this procedure,

00:51.017 --> 00:54.019
Your deck
will be able to support
a great deal of weight -

00:54.020 --> 00:58.023
As many as 12 party guests
and a barbecue.

00:58.024 --> 01:00.358
Or my mother-in-law.

01:02.427 --> 01:05.630
Next week there'll be
no more nana jokes
about her weight,

01:05.631 --> 01:08.399
Because they're cheap and easy,
and I'm above that.

01:08.400 --> 01:11.803
And she's coming to town
next week.

01:11.804 --> 01:13.304
But that's next week,

01:13.305 --> 01:17.175
So this week it's open season
on that wildebeest.

01:17.176 --> 01:19.277
Al, did I tell you the time

01:19.278 --> 01:23.214
That nana didn't shave her chin
for three days

01:23.215 --> 01:26.051
And two bison followed her home?

01:26.052 --> 01:27.919
Whoa.

01:27.920 --> 01:31.422
Tim, I believe our show today
is about decks.

01:31.423 --> 01:34.826
That's right, and I certainly
know my way around a deck.

01:34.827 --> 01:37.295
Let's get into the construction
technique, can we?

01:37.296 --> 01:39.731
Now, the footing here
holds the post.

01:39.732 --> 01:41.733
The post is connected
to the beam,

01:41.734 --> 01:43.735
The beam is connected
to the joist,

01:43.736 --> 01:45.737
The joist is connected...
<i>♪ to the hip bone</i>

01:45.738 --> 01:47.739
<i>♪ hip bone connected</i>
<i>to the thigh bone</i>

01:47.740 --> 01:50.842
Al, take it.
Come on, buddy.
Not in this life, tim.

01:50.843 --> 01:53.377
And once you get
your deck finished,

01:53.378 --> 01:56.147
It's solid enough,
even nana could jump
on this thing.

01:56.148 --> 01:58.316
Tim, you know -
no, you don't -

02:00.385 --> 02:03.521
Binford sealant.
You can pick it up
at your local store.

03:16.728 --> 03:19.764
Well, what do you think?
Could we put the kids
in the middle?

03:24.603 --> 03:26.805
Hi, mom.
Is nana here yet?

03:26.806 --> 03:28.306
No, not yet.

03:28.307 --> 03:30.441
Don't put your books
on the table.

03:30.442 --> 03:32.743
Don't walk on the floor.
I just mopped it.

03:32.744 --> 03:35.180
Hi, guys.
Freeze.

03:35.181 --> 03:36.681
Oh, lady, lady, come on.

03:36.682 --> 03:39.684
All the dust I have
is in my back pocket
right there.

03:39.685 --> 03:42.987
I got a little extra lint
in my bellybutton.

03:42.988 --> 03:46.090
I just mopped the floor.
I don't want you to walk
on it. Take off your shoes.

03:46.091 --> 03:49.660
Guys, take all that stuff
upstairs and hide it.

03:49.661 --> 03:52.163
<i>(whistles)</i> every time
your mom comes here,

03:52.164 --> 03:54.165
You turn into helga
the psycho cleaner.

03:54.166 --> 03:56.534
I'm just tidying up a bit.
Don't touch that!

03:56.535 --> 03:58.703
You're gonna get fingerprints
all over it.

03:58.704 --> 04:01.139
How do you see
out of the back
of your head?

04:01.140 --> 04:03.474
Don't laugh at all those
embarrassing stories

04:03.475 --> 04:05.476
My mother tells
when she gets here.

04:05.477 --> 04:07.145
They're not
really embarrassing.

04:07.146 --> 04:09.214
Some of them
are really kind of funny.

04:09.215 --> 04:11.883
My favorite is when you dove
off the high dive as a kid,

04:11.884 --> 04:13.885
The top of your bathing suit
came off,

04:13.886 --> 04:16.721
And the lifeguards were
using them as a slingshot
to go... Tchee!

04:16.721 --> 04:18.689
Tch! Ha-ha-ha.

04:18.690 --> 04:21.291
Hoo. Oh, boy.

04:21.293 --> 04:23.761
That wasn't funny
at all, huh?

04:23.762 --> 04:26.097
You see, this is
just what I mean.

04:26.098 --> 04:28.432
Mom always thinks
stuff like that is funny,

04:28.433 --> 04:30.434
And if she knew
anything about me,

04:30.435 --> 04:33.104
She'd realize
that those stories
are painful to me.

04:33.105 --> 04:36.607
If they're so painful,
why don't you tell her?
I can't tell my mother.

04:36.608 --> 04:39.944
<i>(imitates her)</i>
why can't you
tell your mother?

04:39.945 --> 04:41.445
It's old stuff, tim.

04:41.446 --> 04:43.781
You know, just...
Stay out of it, ok?

04:43.782 --> 04:45.616
All right, all right,
I'm neutral.

04:45.617 --> 04:47.451
I'm switzerland.
I have no opinion.

04:47.452 --> 04:49.720
Hi, dad.
Buddy.

04:49.721 --> 04:52.223
What's nana gonna get me
for my birthday?

04:52.224 --> 04:53.925
Well, I don't know, honey.

04:53.926 --> 04:56.928
You're just gonna
have to wait and see
when she gets here.

04:56.929 --> 05:00.331
Birthday boy.
Or should I say
birthday <i>man?</i>

05:00.332 --> 05:02.166
Year older,
and that peach fuzz

05:02.167 --> 05:04.168
Is turning into
a little 5:00 shadow.

05:04.169 --> 05:05.970
Ar-ar-ar-ar.
Ar-ar-ar-ar.

05:05.971 --> 05:09.307
I ordered the balloons
and the piñata today.

05:09.308 --> 05:11.809
Huh? Well, cancel the order.

05:11.810 --> 05:15.380
This kid is the big 0-8,
halfway to driving age.

05:15.381 --> 05:19.350
I'm thinking
indy 500 birthday.

05:19.351 --> 05:21.685
Checkered flags,
maybe food would go along...

05:21.686 --> 05:23.187
Ah, startin' to get it.

05:23.188 --> 05:25.589
We could make a cake
in the shape of a car.

05:25.590 --> 05:27.792
Racecar cake. Oh!

05:27.793 --> 05:30.962
Penske lola chassis,
titanium valves
and all that stuff.

05:30.963 --> 05:33.898
Kevlar tub.
<i>(grunts)</i>
<i>(grunts)</i>

05:33.899 --> 05:36.401
Come on, honey. Join in.
Let's grunt as a family.

05:36.402 --> 05:40.371
<i>(all grunt)</i>

05:40.372 --> 05:41.772
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>
uh-oh.

05:41.773 --> 05:44.342
That's my mom.
Brad - randy - mark!

05:44.343 --> 05:46.811
Go and comb your hair. Tim?

05:46.812 --> 05:50.381
I have no opinion.
Good.

05:50.382 --> 05:51.882
She's a little early.

05:51.883 --> 05:54.385
I didn't have time
to widen the door frame.

05:54.386 --> 05:57.721
No more fat jokes.
Tim. Tim.

05:59.724 --> 06:01.625
Ta-da!

06:01.626 --> 06:03.494
Whoa!

06:03.495 --> 06:06.564
Where's the rest of you?
You coming in shifts?

06:08.767 --> 06:10.768
Mom, I -
ta-da!

06:10.769 --> 06:13.271
You didn't tell me
you lost all that weight.

06:13.272 --> 06:14.572
Are you all right?

06:14.573 --> 06:17.408
Oh, I'm fine.
I wanted to surprise you.

06:17.409 --> 06:18.742
Well, you did.

06:18.743 --> 06:22.813
Oh, mom,
you look sensational.
Oh, thank you.

06:22.814 --> 06:24.482
Well?
Well.

06:24.483 --> 06:26.250
You do look sensational.

06:26.251 --> 06:30.355
I can't remember
being able to hug you
and touch my hand.

06:30.356 --> 06:32.357
Here, come on...
I'll take your coat.

06:32.358 --> 06:34.325
All right.
Thank you.

06:34.326 --> 06:36.094
Oh, my, jill.

06:36.095 --> 06:38.429
Oh, honey,
this looks very nice.

06:38.430 --> 06:41.932
Well, thank you.
I didn't even have
time to clean.

06:41.933 --> 06:44.535
Oh, how is
that new job going?

06:44.536 --> 06:46.637
It's good. It's great.

06:46.638 --> 06:49.640
You know, it's just
that it's kind of hard,

06:49.641 --> 06:53.344
'cause I have to juggle
the kids and the job,
and the time...

06:53.345 --> 06:57.515
Well, life is hard.
You just have to
buck up and do it.

06:57.516 --> 07:01.152
Right. Right.

07:01.153 --> 07:04.222
Well, mom, you really -
you look amazing.

07:04.223 --> 07:07.492
Oh, well, thank you, honey.
I owe it all to tim.

07:07.493 --> 07:08.659
How's that?

07:08.660 --> 07:10.694
Those nana jokes
on <i>tool time</i>

07:10.695 --> 07:14.098
Are the best motivation
a fat person could have.

07:14.099 --> 07:15.933
What jokes?

07:15.934 --> 07:18.469
I wouldn't make jokes
about you on the air.

07:18.470 --> 07:20.304
Oh, you wouldn't,
would you?
No.

07:20.305 --> 07:22.140
Well, does this sound
familiar?

07:22.141 --> 07:24.208
What weighs
400 pounds, 2 ounces

07:24.209 --> 07:26.777
And sings in the shower?

07:26.778 --> 07:29.680
Nana holding a bar of soap.

07:33.519 --> 07:35.753
That's funny, though.

07:36.988 --> 07:39.223
Did you tell her
I said that?
No.

07:39.224 --> 07:41.225
You don't
get <i>tool time</i>
in texas.

07:41.226 --> 07:43.394
We bought
a satellite dish.
Oh, god. Oh.

07:43.395 --> 07:45.930
All the neighbors...

07:47.166 --> 07:49.333
All the neighbors come over
to watch the show.

07:49.334 --> 07:51.269
Dad and I
are real celebrities.

07:51.270 --> 07:52.470
Hey, good.

07:52.471 --> 07:56.107
Yes. Of course, I tell everyone
my son-in-law is al.

07:59.178 --> 08:02.012
You want something
to drink - shot
and a beer?

08:02.013 --> 08:03.881
Oh, tim,
those days are over.

08:03.882 --> 08:06.517
It's grapefruit juice
for me from now on.
All right.

08:07.886 --> 08:11.422
Nothing for me, tim.

08:11.423 --> 08:13.424
Hey, guys, come on
down here! Hustle up!

08:13.425 --> 08:15.493
Half your grandma
showed up.

08:18.830 --> 08:21.432
Well, I'm sorry
that daddy couldn't come.

08:21.433 --> 08:23.334
Well, you know the colonel.

08:23.335 --> 08:26.804
He had to make one
of his boring speeches
at the officers' club.

08:26.805 --> 08:29.073
Oh.

08:29.074 --> 08:32.577
Well, really,
it is just incredible
how great you look.

08:32.578 --> 08:35.613
It's just great.
Oh, well,
thank you, honey.

08:35.614 --> 08:38.749
It's really a simple diet.
I have a copy of it
in the car.

08:38.750 --> 08:40.951
All it takes
is a little willpower.

08:40.952 --> 08:42.453
<i>(brad)</i> nana!

08:42.453 --> 08:44.922
Oh, there's my boys.

08:44.923 --> 08:47.358
You're skinny!
Well, thank you.

08:47.359 --> 08:49.460
All right, fall in.
Ten-hut!

08:49.461 --> 08:50.894
<i>(all)</i> hut!

08:50.895 --> 08:54.132
At ease, men.
Now give me some sugar.

08:54.133 --> 08:57.168
Oh, mark,
my birthday boy.

08:58.637 --> 09:02.273
Randy, sweetie pie.
Best sugar in town,
right here.

09:02.274 --> 09:04.442
Oh, brad,
you handsome thing.

09:04.443 --> 09:05.876
How many dates
have you had lately?

09:05.877 --> 09:07.612
Mom, he's too young
to date.

09:07.613 --> 09:10.314
Oh, well,
won't be long now.

09:10.315 --> 09:12.750
Oh, jill, I remember
your first date.

09:12.751 --> 09:15.219
It was jake tyler.
He got to the house...

09:15.220 --> 09:17.188
Mom, nobody wants
to hear this story.

09:17.189 --> 09:18.689
<i>(boys)</i> yeah, we do!

09:18.690 --> 09:20.358
I think
we should hear it.

09:20.359 --> 09:22.026
Jake tyler.

09:22.027 --> 09:24.328
Actually,
I have no opinion.

09:24.329 --> 09:26.730
Oh, jill, I can
just see you.

09:26.731 --> 09:28.732
You had on
that lime green miniskirt

09:28.733 --> 09:30.734
That showed your cute
little pudgy knees.

09:30.735 --> 09:32.603
I didn't have pudgy knees.

09:32.604 --> 09:35.806
But she was
so nervous that night,
instead of deodorant,

09:35.807 --> 09:37.808
She sprayed on
insect repellant.

09:37.809 --> 09:39.310
<i>(boys laughing)</i>

09:39.311 --> 09:42.146
It was only under one arm.
It's not that funny.

09:42.147 --> 09:44.382
It's not that funny.

09:44.383 --> 09:47.951
But maybe next time
you should just hang
a no-pest strip.

09:51.356 --> 09:53.357
Did you bring us
any candy?

09:53.358 --> 09:56.260
Candy? Well,
what do you think?

09:56.261 --> 09:58.062
Mom, please,
not before dinner.

09:58.063 --> 10:01.165
Oh, your mother's right,
but I do have a surprise
for you.

10:01.166 --> 10:03.601
There are presents
for everyone out in the car.

10:03.602 --> 10:05.135
Go get 'em.

10:05.136 --> 10:06.571
I saw that.

10:06.572 --> 10:09.273
Oh, well,
one little candy bar
won't hurt them,

10:09.274 --> 10:11.975
Isn't that right, tim?

10:13.278 --> 10:15.946
I have no opinion.

10:15.947 --> 10:17.948
Oh, jill, I can't wait

10:17.949 --> 10:20.451
For you to see
what I got for you.

10:20.452 --> 10:21.919
For me?

10:21.920 --> 10:24.422
Yes. Since dad and I
are moving into
that new condo,

10:24.423 --> 10:27.358
I've decided
to give you and your sisters
some things from the house.

10:27.359 --> 10:29.360
I've picked out something

10:29.361 --> 10:31.362
That I know has
special meaning for you.

10:31.363 --> 10:33.864
Oh, I wonder if those boys
can handle that box.

10:33.865 --> 10:37.401
I'll get it, mom.
No, no, better not.
It's breakable.

10:40.138 --> 10:43.574
Something breakable?

10:43.575 --> 10:46.009
Something that has meaning?

10:46.010 --> 10:48.579
Oh, gosh,
I hope it's that clock.
Which clock?

10:48.580 --> 10:51.949
You know, that beautiful
antique wood clock they have?

10:51.950 --> 10:54.818
The one that has that
stupid chime that wakes me
when we stay there?

10:54.819 --> 10:56.587
I love that clock.

10:56.588 --> 10:59.089
When daddy was moving us
around from base to base

10:59.090 --> 11:01.091
And house to house
all the time,

11:01.092 --> 11:04.094
No matter where we were,
when I heard that clock,

11:04.095 --> 11:06.497
I always knew
that I was home.

11:06.498 --> 11:08.399
All right,
thanks a lot, brad.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.601
Put it on the table, honey.
Be careful, boys.

11:10.602 --> 11:12.403
Guess what's in
these boxes.

11:12.404 --> 11:15.339
Nana got mark a drum set
for his birthday.

11:15.340 --> 11:17.341
<i>(brad)</i> guys, let's go
beat on them upstairs.

11:17.342 --> 11:18.576
Drums?

11:18.577 --> 11:20.978
You got him <i>drums?</i>

11:20.979 --> 11:23.614
Lillian, do you really
hate me that much?

11:23.615 --> 11:25.716
Yes. <i>(laughs)</i>

11:25.717 --> 11:29.253
Oh, jill, I know you've
had your eye on this
for a long time.

11:29.254 --> 11:32.122
Oh, mom, whenever
I look at it,

11:32.123 --> 11:35.293
I'm gonna
think of... Tea.

11:35.294 --> 11:37.295
It's a tea set.

11:37.296 --> 11:38.462
That's right.

11:38.463 --> 11:40.464
Who's the rest
of this stuff for?

11:40.465 --> 11:42.466
The candlesticks
are for katie

11:42.467 --> 11:45.770
And the clock
is for robin.
Robin.

11:45.771 --> 11:48.906
Well, I hope that she loves it
as much as I love this.

11:48.907 --> 11:50.073
Oh, good, honey.

11:50.074 --> 11:52.876
<i>(drums banging)</i>
oh, I hear music.

11:52.877 --> 11:55.946
I'm going up to see
my little buddy rich.

12:00.686 --> 12:03.020
Nice tea set.
That's really...

12:03.021 --> 12:05.155
That's... Chipped.
Kind of shabby.

12:05.156 --> 12:07.991
That means it's antique,
and it's good.

12:07.992 --> 12:10.994
There's no reason
to be upset.
I'm not upset.

12:10.995 --> 12:14.031
I just thought
that she should know
how I feel about the clock.

12:14.032 --> 12:16.600
Why don't you tell her?
I can't.

12:16.601 --> 12:18.936
Yes, you can.
"mom, I want the clock."

12:18.937 --> 12:21.271
That's not how we do things
in my family.

12:21.272 --> 12:23.774
We don't talk
about our feelings.
You know that.

12:23.775 --> 12:25.275
Yes, I do know that,

12:25.276 --> 12:27.745
And this happens every time
your mom comes to visit.

12:27.746 --> 12:29.880
Where does she get off
losing all that weight?

12:29.881 --> 12:32.316
You said
she looked spectacular.

12:32.317 --> 12:35.185
Feeds me chicken-fried steak
and gravy for 20 years,

12:35.186 --> 12:37.355
Shows up here all thin,
with <i>drums.</i>

12:37.356 --> 12:38.356
Ohh.

12:38.357 --> 12:41.258
Tells me my house
looks "nice."

12:43.061 --> 12:45.730
I know what's going on here.
You know what's going on here?

12:45.731 --> 12:48.499
You know exactly what's...
What, tim?!

12:48.500 --> 12:50.901
I have no opinion.

12:55.940 --> 12:58.509
There now. I think
that looks lovely.

13:00.445 --> 13:02.446
Yeah. Now we have a tea set,

13:02.447 --> 13:05.549
But we don't know
what tea time is
without a <i>clock.</i>

13:07.586 --> 13:09.587
Lillian, do you know
what time it is?

13:09.588 --> 13:13.090
No, I didn't put on
my watch today.
Gosh darn it.

13:13.091 --> 13:15.693
There's a clock right here
on the oven, tim.

13:15.694 --> 13:18.195
I know,
but those oven clocks
are so small.

13:18.196 --> 13:21.265
What we need
is a big old antique clock.

13:21.266 --> 13:23.901
Go to london.

13:25.970 --> 13:27.805
Mom, what are you
doing there?

13:27.806 --> 13:29.973
I'm slicing marshmallows
for the tires.

13:29.974 --> 13:32.175
The tires are going to be
those chocolate doughnuts.

13:32.176 --> 13:34.344
Oh. Then the marshmallows
can be the hubcaps.

13:34.345 --> 13:36.847
No, the peppermint candies
are gonna be the hubcaps.

13:36.848 --> 13:39.349
I thought the marshmallows
are gonna be
the shock absorbers.

13:39.350 --> 13:43.020
Did anybody
ask your opinion?

13:43.021 --> 13:45.523
I have no opinion.

13:48.693 --> 13:50.994
Hi-ho, tim.
Hi, wilson.

13:50.995 --> 13:53.664
Boy, you are just the man
I want to see.
Yeah?

13:53.665 --> 13:55.866
I've got a birthday present
for mark.

13:55.867 --> 13:58.969
Oh, it's nice of you,
but I don't think I want
to pierce his ears so early.

13:58.970 --> 14:00.971
No, no, no, no, tim.
It's not an earring.

14:00.972 --> 14:02.606
It's a dream catcher.

14:02.607 --> 14:04.608
Children
of the chippewa indians

14:04.609 --> 14:07.611
Hang them
in their window at night
to catch the bad dreams,

14:07.612 --> 14:09.279
And then in the morning,

14:09.280 --> 14:11.515
The sunshine
whisks the bad dreams away.

14:11.516 --> 14:15.185
You got anything that'll
whisk a mother-in-law away?

14:15.186 --> 14:17.354
Nana problems, tim?

14:17.355 --> 14:20.324
Nah, nah. It's jill.

14:20.325 --> 14:22.493
She thinks her mom
doesn't understand her,

14:22.494 --> 14:24.495
But she never tells her
how she feels,

14:24.496 --> 14:27.565
So her mom
doesn't really understand
that she doesn't understand.

14:27.566 --> 14:29.199
I understand.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.702
What is it with women?
Her mom brought gifts.

14:31.703 --> 14:34.472
She gave jill a tea set
and gave her sister robin
this clock.

14:34.473 --> 14:36.239
Jill wants the clock.

14:36.240 --> 14:39.743
Why can't she just say,
"I want the clock"?

14:39.744 --> 14:41.745
Well, tim, these are
complicated things,

14:41.746 --> 14:44.448
And it has been
a few years since I read
<i>my mother, my self...</i>

14:44.449 --> 14:46.650
<i>(whistles)</i> whoa.
Whoa. Whoa.

14:46.651 --> 14:49.854
Back the bookmobile up.

14:49.855 --> 14:53.591
You read a book
called <i>my mother, my self?</i>

14:53.592 --> 14:56.627
It was the '70s, tim.
It was an open time.

14:56.628 --> 14:58.596
I remember the '70s.

14:58.597 --> 15:01.098
Mood rings,
eight-track cassettes.

15:01.099 --> 15:02.933
You see, tim,
once the baby girl

15:02.934 --> 15:04.768
Comes out of
the mother's womb,

15:04.769 --> 15:07.270
She spends the rest of her life
trying to separate from her.

15:07.271 --> 15:09.373
They are separate.
They live in different states.

15:09.374 --> 15:12.843
No, no. No, tim, I'm talking
about emotional separation.

15:12.844 --> 15:14.578
You see, subconsciously,

15:14.579 --> 15:17.781
Jill may feel
that if she doesn't want
what her mother gives her,

15:17.782 --> 15:20.618
She's being disloyal to
the person who gave her life.

15:20.619 --> 15:22.285
What?

15:22.286 --> 15:24.555
Why do women get so confused
about this stuff?

15:24.556 --> 15:26.657
I lived in a family
of all boys.

15:26.658 --> 15:28.792
We were very clear
about our communication.

15:28.793 --> 15:30.794
If I wanted something
my brother had,

15:30.795 --> 15:33.263
I'd knock him down
and take it.

15:33.264 --> 15:36.233
Hmm. Well, that's
very effective but crude.

15:36.234 --> 15:38.869
Right. I think I can
help these two ladies out

15:38.870 --> 15:41.872
If I could just sit them down
and tell them exactly
what's going on.

15:41.873 --> 15:43.473
No, no, no, tim.

15:43.474 --> 15:46.443
Throughout history,
many truths have passed
from man to man,

15:46.444 --> 15:49.146
And the one truth
that transcends all cultures

15:49.147 --> 15:53.784
Is "when mother-in-law visits,
man should stay in garage."

15:53.785 --> 15:56.286
I got a lot of work
to do on the hot rod.

15:56.287 --> 15:58.455
Might as well
just close the door
and start her up.

15:58.456 --> 16:00.123
<i>(grunts like ape)</i>

16:01.893 --> 16:03.894
Oh, lillian,
you finished the cake.

16:03.895 --> 16:05.896
Mark's gonna love that.
It's beautiful.

16:05.897 --> 16:08.065
Tim, I want to talk to you
about jill.

16:08.066 --> 16:10.568
I think she's upset.
I'm going to the garage.

16:10.569 --> 16:12.402
She ate up
all the hubcaps,

16:12.403 --> 16:14.237
And then she went
upstairs.

16:14.238 --> 16:16.373
I gotta do some work
on the hot rod, ok?

16:16.374 --> 16:21.311
Please? Please?
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.

16:21.312 --> 16:23.981
Tim...
<i>(groans)</i>

16:25.450 --> 16:28.318
I think I know why
jill is so tense.

16:28.319 --> 16:30.988
You do?
Yes.

16:30.989 --> 16:33.824
So she's sharing
her feelings with you?

16:33.825 --> 16:36.694
Well, not
in so many words...
Well?

16:36.695 --> 16:38.896
...But I think
it's pretty clear...
Uh-huh.

16:38.897 --> 16:41.398
...That you two are having
intimacy problems.

16:41.399 --> 16:42.933
<i>(clang)</i>

16:42.934 --> 16:45.302
Ohh!

16:45.303 --> 16:48.872
What? No. No. No.

16:48.873 --> 16:50.874
It's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

16:50.875 --> 16:52.876
This sort of thing can happen
after 15 years.

16:52.877 --> 16:55.545
Stop. Don't do that.
Put it here. Here.

16:58.917 --> 17:01.284
I'm still happening.

17:01.285 --> 17:04.221
Well, all right,
but if you and jill
are having problems...

17:04.222 --> 17:07.023
It's not between me and jill.

17:07.025 --> 17:09.126
It's between you and jill.

17:09.127 --> 17:11.628
What are you talking about?

17:11.630 --> 17:15.432
She doesn't want the tea set.
She wants the clock.

17:15.433 --> 17:18.234
The clock?
Yeah.

17:18.236 --> 17:20.537
Well, why didn't she
just tell me?

17:20.538 --> 17:22.772
Well, I just don't know.

17:22.773 --> 17:25.976
It's a mother-daughter
emotional separation thing
or something.

17:25.977 --> 17:28.078
I came from a family
of all guys.

17:28.079 --> 17:30.681
We're very clear about
our emotional separations.

17:30.682 --> 17:33.884
I hit my brother,
I laugh, he cries.

17:36.187 --> 17:37.788
What?

17:37.789 --> 17:39.289
I can't explain it.

17:39.290 --> 17:42.860
You gotta read the book
<i>hey, mother, I'm selfish.</i>

17:48.399 --> 17:51.168
Tim, can you help me
with the hamburgers?

17:51.169 --> 17:53.170
In a minute.
In a minute, all right?

17:53.171 --> 17:54.504
I'll help you, jill.

17:54.505 --> 17:56.506
I'm gaining on you.
I'm gaining on you.

17:56.507 --> 17:58.008
I'm gaining -
I win!

17:58.009 --> 17:59.877
<i>(kids)</i> yay!

17:59.878 --> 18:03.113
Dad, she beat you
<i>again.</i>
I got eyes, pal.

18:03.114 --> 18:06.249
Sorry, mr. Taylor.
I didn't mean to win.

18:06.250 --> 18:07.751
Don't get cocky, ok?

18:07.752 --> 18:10.721
You're not champion around here
until you win...

18:10.722 --> 18:13.323
Five out of nine.

18:13.324 --> 18:15.625
Hey, you better
start losing real quick,

18:15.626 --> 18:18.128
Or else you're gonna
be here all night.

18:18.129 --> 18:19.997
<i>(whistles)</i> junior?

18:19.998 --> 18:21.598
Ok, here we go.

18:21.599 --> 18:24.735
3, 2... Is that a dog?

18:24.736 --> 18:26.436
1.
Yeah, come on!

18:26.437 --> 18:29.139
<i>(kids cheering)</i>

18:39.751 --> 18:43.486
Jill, why didn't you tell me
you wanted that clock?

18:43.487 --> 18:48.092
I don't want that clock.
Who said I wanted the clock?
Tim told me.

18:48.093 --> 18:50.728
<i>(sighs)</i> he wasn't
supposed to get involved.

18:50.729 --> 18:52.930
Well, I charmed it
out of him.

18:52.931 --> 18:55.699
It's no big deal, mom.
It doesn't matter.

18:55.700 --> 18:58.001
Well, apparently it is.

18:58.002 --> 19:01.338
He says that we don't talk,
that we don't share feelings.

19:01.339 --> 19:03.340
Now, that's not true, is it?

19:03.341 --> 19:05.642
Well, in a way, mom.

19:05.643 --> 19:08.846
You're always the one
that said we shouldn't
get emotional.

19:08.847 --> 19:12.515
When did I ever say
anything like that?

19:12.516 --> 19:15.819
All the time.
When?

19:17.321 --> 19:19.356
Ok. For example,

19:19.357 --> 19:22.025
There was that time
in virginia.

19:22.026 --> 19:24.928
I was playing in the sandbox,
and you came up to tell me

19:24.929 --> 19:27.597
That we were moving
for the third time
in two years,

19:27.598 --> 19:31.635
And I started to cry,
and you said,

19:31.636 --> 19:35.239
"don't get emotional.
Crying isn't going to help.

19:35.240 --> 19:38.575
We're a military family.
This is who we are."

19:41.445 --> 19:44.414
Well, I'm sorry, honey,
but I don't remember that.

19:44.415 --> 19:46.850
It was an important
conversation, mom.

19:46.851 --> 19:49.052
Jill, I had five daughters.

19:49.053 --> 19:52.722
There were lots
of important conversations.

19:52.723 --> 19:55.325
Well, of course
you're right.

19:55.326 --> 19:57.327
I'm sorry
I brought it up.

19:57.328 --> 20:00.330
All right, now, you just
hold it right there,
young lady.

20:00.331 --> 20:02.766
All that moving was hard
on the whole family,

20:02.767 --> 20:04.601
And your father knew that.

20:04.602 --> 20:07.104
Seeing us upset would have
made things worse for him.

20:07.105 --> 20:09.273
We all had to be
good little soldiers.

20:09.274 --> 20:12.276
Yeah. Yeah, I remember all that
"good little soldier" stuff -

20:12.277 --> 20:14.311
Having to keep the house
in perfect shape,

20:14.312 --> 20:16.379
Lining us up
in our perfect little dresses

20:16.380 --> 20:18.415
With all the other
officers' kids.

20:18.416 --> 20:21.685
Yes, that's right.
We were mean, lean
and clean.

20:21.686 --> 20:23.687
But we had fun, too.

20:23.688 --> 20:27.191
You and your sisters
played hopscotch
and jacks

20:27.192 --> 20:30.060
Just like all the other
little girls.

20:30.061 --> 20:32.062
You and I
had our tea time.

20:32.063 --> 20:33.897
We had our what?

20:33.898 --> 20:35.999
Well, tea time.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.870
We'd have tea and cookies,
but I'd tell you we were
having tea and crumpets.

20:39.871 --> 20:42.439
<i>(chuckles)</i> then,
when your father came home,

20:42.440 --> 20:45.809
You'd tell him
we had tea and puppets.

20:45.810 --> 20:49.112
Tea and puppets.
I said that?

20:49.113 --> 20:52.850
That is so cute.
How could you stand me?

20:54.685 --> 20:57.454
Sometimes I couldn't.

20:57.455 --> 21:02.392
So that's why you wanted me
to have the tea set.

21:02.393 --> 21:05.628
Well, yes. I know you look
at that tea set,

21:05.629 --> 21:08.698
And you see some old cups
and a chipped saucer,

21:08.699 --> 21:12.936
But I look at that tea set,
and I see you.

21:14.572 --> 21:19.376
I'm sorry, mom.
I just... Didn't remember.

21:22.247 --> 21:26.350
Well, whichever gift you want
is fine with me, dear.

21:26.351 --> 21:30.387
Well, now I want both.

21:32.757 --> 21:35.092
Well, jillian patterson,

21:35.093 --> 21:37.094
You have to share
with your sisters.

21:37.095 --> 21:39.963
I don't know why
you had to give me
so many sisters anyway.

21:39.964 --> 21:41.398
Oh, hush.

21:48.740 --> 21:51.041
<i>(cheering)</i>

21:57.015 --> 22:00.683
Yay!

22:00.684 --> 22:04.121
Hey, dad,
she beat you again.

22:04.122 --> 22:05.622
That was pretty lame.

22:05.623 --> 22:07.524
Hang it up, old man.

22:07.525 --> 22:10.027
Can I go play
with my friends now?

22:10.028 --> 22:13.063
You're starting
to tick me off a little bit.

22:13.064 --> 22:16.233
Championship round.
One more race, winner take all.

22:16.234 --> 22:19.236
But I think I blew
the motor in my car,

22:19.237 --> 22:24.374
So I've got a little
secret weapon down here
that I built.

22:24.375 --> 22:26.376
Hey, what's that, dad?

22:26.377 --> 22:28.812
I took the motor
out of the dustbuster.

22:31.215 --> 22:32.916
All right, ready?

22:32.917 --> 22:34.418
Winner take all.
Last race.

22:34.419 --> 22:36.820
3, 2, 1, go.

22:55.372 --> 22:57.640
<i>(woman)</i> this time,
when you cheer,

22:57.641 --> 22:59.142
You can make noise.

22:59.143 --> 23:02.312
What a novel idea.

23:02.313 --> 23:06.049
Have you ever worked
with children before here?

23:06.050 --> 23:09.586
5, 4, 3, 2.

23:12.923 --> 23:16.093
No, no. Tim.
What?

23:16.094 --> 23:18.628
It's your line.
Don't get cocky, tim.
