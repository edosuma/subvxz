Bye, girls.

08:38.018 --> 08:41.688
That's strange.

08:38.018 --> 08:41.688
I wonder what the problem is.

08:41.729 --> 08:45.359
The wheel fell off.

Oh, no,

here's the problem.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.529
The hardware store

No, don't fix anything.

08:55.243 --> 08:58.788

I thought you wanted

09:18.058 --> 09:19.976
to be in the race?

09:20.018 --> 09:22.562
I know I did, but now I don't.

I'm not upset.

Well, I...guess I'll

10:26.084 --> 10:27.877
you're gonna feel about this--

10:27.919 --> 10:30.380
Look, Steve, it's natural

10:27.919 --> 10:30.380
to feel a sense of loss

16:34.869 --> 16:37.538
- Oh yeah.

16:37.580 --> 16:40.625
I never built a car

16:37.580 --> 16:40.625
for a girl driver.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.252
When I was growin' up,

16:40.667 --> 16:43.252
girls weren't allowed to race.

16:44.963 --> 16:46.881
So why'd you quit?

16:46.923 --> 16:50.802
Because everybody was saying

16:46.923 --> 16:50.802
girls can't make cars.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.261
Ah, you mean Kenny?

16:52.303 --> 16:56.850
No. Daddy,

16:52.303 --> 16:56.850
Uncle Jesse, and you.

16:58.601 --> 17:01.187
But now I know that you guys

16:58.601 --> 17:01.187
were all just kidding.

17:01.228 --> 17:02.897
Oh.

17:02.939 --> 17:04.691
Michelle..

17:04.732 --> 17:08.528
...I'm sorry if I helped

17:04.732 --> 17:08.528
give you the wrong idea.

17:08.569 --> 17:11.614
You know, being a girl

17:08.569 --> 17:11.614
is pretty special.

17:11.656 --> 17:14.534
I like it so far.

17:14.575 --> 17:17.662
Mm, and the good stuff's

17:14.575 --> 17:17.662
coming up.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.957
Aunt Becky,

17:17.704 --> 17:20.957
can I...unquit?

17:22.500 --> 17:23.793
Sure.

17:24.878 --> 17:26.212
Oh.

17:29.131 --> 17:32.218
Grab a paintbrush, girl.

17:29.131 --> 17:32.218

Hey, Michelle.

17:55.366 --> 17:58.995
Congratulations, sweetie.

17:59.037 --> 18:02.289
What for? I haven't

17:59.037 --> 18:02.289
even raced yet.

18:02.331 --> 18:04.834
So what, munchkin? You built

18:02.331 --> 18:04.834
the car, you never quit.

18:04.876 --> 18:07.587
Well, actually,

18:04.876 --> 18:07.587
she did quit once.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.171
Yeah, but then

18:07.628 --> 18:09.171
she unquit.

18:09.213 --> 18:11.257
Yeah, but technically,

18:09.213 --> 18:11.257
she did quit.

18:11.298 --> 18:12.842
- But she's here now--

18:11.298 --> 18:12.842
- 'I know, but she quit..'

18:12.884 --> 18:14.677
Girls, please, uh, girls,

18:12.884 --> 18:14.677

Alright, Michelle.

18:24.896 --> 18:26.480
You know, all we have to do

18:26.522 --> 18:27.732
is make it through

18:26.522 --> 18:27.732
the preliminaries

18:27.774 --> 18:28.775
and then

18:27.774 --> 18:28.775
