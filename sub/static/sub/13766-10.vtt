00:02.085 --> 00:04.713
(music playing over TV)

00:13.597 --> 00:15.516
What are you looking at,

00:13.597 --> 00:15.516
monkey boy?

00:15.557 --> 00:16.725
Ow!

00:16.767 --> 00:18.059
Ow! Ow! Reese!

00:18.101 --> 00:19.353
What are you doing?

00:19.394 --> 00:22.063
Help! Ow! Help! Mom, help!

00:22.105 --> 00:24.065
No, cut it out. Cut it out.

00:22.105 --> 00:24.065
Ow! Ow! Ow!

00:24.107 --> 00:26.067
Help! It hurts! Ow!

00:26.109 --> 00:27.778
Knock it off, you little...

00:26.109 --> 00:27.778
LOIS: Reese!

00:27.820 --> 00:29.321
What the heck are you doing?

00:27.820 --> 00:29.321
Honest to God,

00:29.363 --> 00:32.073
you can't leave that kid alone

00:29.363 --> 00:32.073
for five minutes

00:32.115 --> 00:33.575
without picking on him!

00:32.115 --> 00:33.575
I didn't do anything, Mom.

00:33.617 --> 00:35.661
Go!

00:33.617 --> 00:35.661
He's lying!

00:35.703 --> 00:37.245
I gave him that.

Honey, which juice

01:15.158 --> 01:17.369
don't I like--

01:17.411 --> 01:18.495
apple or grape?

01:18.537 --> 01:20.121
You don't like either.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.540
Oh, right.

01:21.582 --> 01:24.125
Malcolm, what is all this

01:21.582 --> 01:24.125
stuff from your teacher?

01:24.167 --> 01:26.169
That woman sends home two

01:24.167 --> 01:26.169
or three fliers every day.

01:26.211 --> 01:28.005
She says she wants the parents

01:28.047 --> 01:30.131
to be as involved as possible

01:28.047 --> 01:30.131
with the children.

01:30.173 --> 01:32.927
At school? It's the

01:30.173 --> 01:32.927
only break I get.

01:32.968 --> 01:35.846
What exactly is "personal

01:32.968 --> 01:35.846
fulfillment week"?

01:35.888 --> 01:37.222
Square dancing.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.307
That's right,

01:37.264 --> 01:39.307
square dancing.

01:39.349 --> 01:40.809
You should see it.

01:40.851 --> 01:43.062
The Krelboynes dance

01:40.851 --> 01:43.062
on the tetherball courts

01:43.102 --> 01:44.438
in front

01:43.102 --> 01:44.438
of the whole school.

01:44.479 --> 01:45.814
We laugh our asses off.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.149
Excuse me?

01:48.191 --> 01:49.192
Butts.

01:49.234 --> 01:50.611
We laugh our butts off.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.153
Uh-oh.

01:52.195 --> 01:54.031
Open.

01:54.073 --> 01:55.156
Swish.

01:55.198 --> 01:56.825
Spit.

01:56.867 --> 01:58.410
This tastes like crap.

01:58.452 --> 01:59.828
Reese is right.

01:59.870 --> 02:01.747
This class is turning me

01:59.870 --> 02:01.747
into a total weirdo.

02:01.789 --> 02:04.041
You are not a weirdo.

02:01.789 --> 02:04.041
You are gifted.

02:04.083 --> 02:06.167
And if gifted kids are

02:04.083 --> 02:06.167
supposed to square-dance,

02:06.209 --> 02:07.252
then you'll do it.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.797
Probably teaches you geometry.

02:09.838 --> 02:12.173
Don't forget to mail these

02:09.838 --> 02:12.173
bills; they're late.

02:09.838 --> 02:12.173
Ah. Ooh!

02:12.215 --> 02:14.093
Two blues, only one pink.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.093
We're doing better.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.260
Well, don't get cocky.

02:15.302 --> 02:17.178
They're hot until

02:15.302 --> 02:17.178
I deposit my paycheck.

02:17.220 --> 02:20.015
You kids, let's get going.

02:17.220 --> 02:20.015
Come on, Malcolm!

02:20.057 --> 02:21.850
You don't want them to

02:20.057 --> 02:21.850
do-si-doing without you.

02:21.892 --> 02:24.269
That's it!

02:21.892 --> 02:24.269
For the sake of my manhood,

02:24.311 --> 02:26.438
today I'm ditching school.

02:24.311 --> 02:26.438
Hey!

02:26.480 --> 02:28.774
Why don't I drive you boys

02:26.480 --> 02:28.774
to school today?

02:28.816 --> 02:30.191
Uh, that's okay, Dad.

02:30.233 --> 02:31.610
I don't mind walking.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.862
Oh, no, no, no.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.862
I really want to.

02:33.904 --> 02:35.697
A chance to spend

02:33.904 --> 02:35.697
a few extra minutes

02:35.739 --> 02:37.616
with my sons,

02:35.739 --> 02:37.616
enjoying their company.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.201
Honestly, son, it'll be

02:37.658 --> 02:40.201
the highlight of my day.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.870
Come on.

02:41.912 --> 02:45.165
Great. Now I can't

02:41.912 --> 02:45.165
even be mad at him.

02:48.167 --> 02:51.046
Aw, Stanley.

02:51.088 --> 02:54.049
Let me show you how it's done.

02:54.091 --> 02:55.509
Uh-oh, eyes down.

03:03.976 --> 03:05.268
That was good.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.228
You didn't give them

03:05.310 --> 03:07.228
any satisfaction.

03:07.270 --> 03:10.524
In another six months,

03:07.270 --> 03:10.524
they'll be bored with you.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.111
(indistinct chatter on TV)

03:17.865 --> 03:20.534
(laughing)

03:17.865 --> 03:20.534
That's got to hurt!

03:20.575 --> 03:23.037
Mom was right.

03:23.078 --> 03:27.124
I do get some sick thrill

03:23.078 --> 03:27.124
out of trouble.

03:29.292 --> 03:30.669
Ow!

03:30.711 --> 03:32.754
That skinny guy!

03:30.711 --> 03:32.754
Come on, get him!

03:32.796 --> 03:34.255
Commandant on the floor.

03:34.297 --> 03:36.591
Ten-hut!

03:43.182 --> 03:45.225
(snarling)

03:47.978 --> 03:49.646
I smell smoke.

03:49.688 --> 03:52.524
Who is responsible?

03:55.235 --> 03:56.277
Very well.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.530
We'll do it the hard way.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.365
Patton.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.325
(growling)

04:05.328 --> 04:07.288
(growling)

04:11.334 --> 04:12.502
(barking)

04:12.544 --> 04:16.215
Francis, please lift up

04:16.256 --> 04:17.758
your right foot.

04:24.056 --> 04:26.016
Son, you have

04:24.056 --> 04:26.016
the worst attitude

04:26.058 --> 04:29.394
I've ever seen in 15 years

04:26.058 --> 04:29.394
at this institution.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.188
You seem compelled

04:31.230 --> 04:33.314
to break every rule,

04:31.230 --> 04:33.314
to flout every convention.

04:33.356 --> 04:35.192
You are never

04:33.356 --> 04:35.192
gonna make it--

04:35.234 --> 04:38.403
in the Armed Forces

04:35.234 --> 04:38.403
or anywhere else.

04:38.445 --> 04:42.199
Now, I was never fortunate

04:38.445 --> 04:42.199
enough to serve in combat,

04:42.241 --> 04:44.910
but I do know what it requires.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.995
Look at this dog.

04:47.037 --> 04:49.414
He is vicious,

04:47.037 --> 04:49.414
he is ungrateful,

04:49.456 --> 04:52.333
and yet even  he  understands

04:49.456 --> 04:52.333
the importance

04:52.375 --> 04:53.543
of obedience.

04:53.585 --> 04:56.046
Do you hear

04:53.585 --> 04:56.046
what I am saying, Francis?

04:56.088 --> 04:57.965
Yes, sir.

04:56.088 --> 04:57.965
I'll try to be more like

04:58.006 --> 04:59.382
a Jack Russell terrier, sir.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.509
There will be

05:01.551 --> 05:05.430
no hot water for this floor

05:01.551 --> 05:05.430
for the entire month.

05:05.472 --> 05:08.809
You can thank the cadet

05:05.472 --> 05:08.809
after I leave.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.980
(snarling)

05:20.112 --> 05:21.071
(blow landing)

05:21.113 --> 05:22.363
FRANCIS:

05:21.113 --> 05:22.363
Ow!

05:22.405 --> 05:26.243
Reese wiped his booger

05:22.405 --> 05:26.243
on my lunch bag.

05:26.285 --> 05:27.995
Dewey, what have we taught you

05:26.285 --> 05:27.995
about snitching?

05:28.036 --> 05:29.788
"Only snitch

05:28.036 --> 05:29.788
when asked to snitch."

05:29.830 --> 05:31.372
Good boy.

05:31.414 --> 05:34.168
So, looking forward to school?

05:34.209 --> 05:37.045
I guess.

05:34.209 --> 05:37.045
Well, that's a shame.

05:37.087 --> 05:40.423
'Cause we're not going

05:37.087 --> 05:40.423
to school.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.383
(chuckling)

05:42.425 --> 05:44.303
Where are we going?

05:44.343 --> 05:46.387
Boys, I'm going to share

05:44.343 --> 05:46.387
something with you

05:46.429 --> 05:49.599
I hope you'll remember

05:46.429 --> 05:49.599
for the rest of your lives.

05:49.641 --> 05:51.392
Now, I don't want

05:49.641 --> 05:51.392
to spoil the surprise,

05:51.434 --> 05:53.812
but I've been planning this

05:51.434 --> 05:53.812
for years.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.438
I just had to wait

05:55.480 --> 05:57.440
until you were all old enough

05:55.480 --> 05:57.440
to appreciate it.

05:57.482 --> 05:58.650
(clicks tongue)

05:58.692 --> 06:00.401
Hookers?

06:00.443 --> 06:02.821
If it gets me out

06:00.443 --> 06:02.821
of square dancing, fine.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.405
HAL:

06:02.863 --> 06:04.405
Just sit back

06:04.447 --> 06:06.407
and enjoy the ride, boys.

06:06.449 --> 06:07.993
We're rebels.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.828
We're wild men!

06:09.870 --> 06:11.412
(cackling)

06:11.454 --> 06:12.873
Whoo!

06:12.914 --> 06:16.084
("Sukiyaki" sung in Japanese)

06:26.303 --> 06:29.306
Where did I put

06:26.303 --> 06:29.306
the damn paycheck?

06:46.489 --> 06:48.449
(quietly):

06:46.489 --> 06:48.449
Yeah.

06:48.491 --> 06:50.744
Those guys are wimps.

06:50.785 --> 06:53.330
That's not even half the size

06:50.785 --> 06:53.330
of the one I gave you

06:53.372 --> 06:55.123
just to get you

06:53.372 --> 06:55.123
out of riflery.

06:55.165 --> 06:57.709
Hey, thanks

06:55.165 --> 06:57.709
for pulling them off me.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.294
I owe you one.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.462
(scoffs)

06:59.336 --> 07:01.462
One?

07:01.504 --> 07:05.175
Hey, you want to see

07:01.504 --> 07:05.175
something very, very cool?

07:07.928 --> 07:10.555
Oh, boy, what have

07:07.928 --> 07:10.555
you done now?

07:11.932 --> 07:15.060
FRANCIS:

07:11.932 --> 07:15.060
Oh, isn't he beautiful?

07:15.102 --> 07:17.478
He only cost me $20.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.478
I'm calling him Otis.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.480
Did you listen to

07:17.520 --> 07:19.480
anything Spangler said?

07:19.522 --> 07:21.149
You're already in

07:19.522 --> 07:21.149
enough trouble as it is

07:21.191 --> 07:22.483
without bringing in a pet.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.945
Well, Spangler has

07:22.525 --> 07:24.945
that oversized gerbil.

07:24.986 --> 07:27.364
And besides,

07:24.986 --> 07:27.364
Otis is not a pet.

07:27.406 --> 07:28.990
Otis is a symbol.

07:29.032 --> 07:30.491
Of what?

07:30.533 --> 07:32.994
Of everything that is

07:30.533 --> 07:32.994
beautiful in the world.

07:33.036 --> 07:34.495
Independence...

07:34.537 --> 07:35.747
free thought.

07:35.789 --> 07:38.208
I may be stuck here in

07:35.789 --> 07:38.208
this militaristic loony bin,

07:38.250 --> 07:40.501
but at least some part of me

07:38.250 --> 07:40.501
can stay connected

07:40.543 --> 07:42.503
to the things

07:40.543 --> 07:42.503
that give me my humanity.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.589
You're not gonna

07:42.545 --> 07:44.589
turn me in, are you?

07:44.631 --> 07:46.883
I don't know.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.883
On the one hand,

07:46.925 --> 07:48.927
you're probably

07:46.925 --> 07:48.927
gonna get caught,

07:48.969 --> 07:50.511
because you always do.

07:50.553 --> 07:52.513
Then, of course,

07:50.553 --> 07:52.513
I'll be involved

07:52.555 --> 07:55.434
even though I had

07:52.555 --> 07:55.434
nothing to do with it.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.436
On the other hand...

07:58.603 --> 08:00.021
...it's a snake.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.522
Good man!

First off,

14:13.645 --> 14:15.896
they're able to think maybe

14:15.938 --> 14:18.899
three minutes into the future,

14:15.938 --> 14:18.899
and it's our job

14:18.941 --> 14:21.528

14:18.941 --> 14:21.528
comes crashing down on them

16:06.215 --> 16:09.009

16:06.215 --> 16:09.009

16:09.051 --> 16:10.303
No. I'm just really pissed.

16:35.077 --> 16:36.412
Well, honey, here's the thing.

16:36.454 --> 16:38.080
Right now, you are

16:36.454 --> 16:38.080
actually better off

16:38.122 --> 16:40.040
being as far away from me

16:38.122 --> 16:40.040
as possible.

16:40.082 --> 16:42.126
But...

16:40.082 --> 16:42.126
Aw, you got to trust me

16:42.168 --> 16:45.254
on this one, Francis--

16:42.168 --> 16:45.254
or, uh, should I say...

16:45.296 --> 16:48.299
"Olaf Mortenson"

16:45.296 --> 16:48.299
of Wheatville, Montana?

16:49.175 --> 16:51.886
(dial tone drones)

16:51.928 --> 16:54.764
You know, I have learned more

16:51.928 --> 16:54.764
in two hours with you

16:54.806 --> 16:57.767
than I have

16:54.806 --> 16:57.767
in six years of teaching.

16:57.809 --> 16:59.853
(sighs)

16:57.809 --> 16:59.853
So, did your life

16:59.894 --> 17:02.062
turn out anything at all

16:59.894 --> 17:02.062
like you planned?

17:02.104 --> 17:03.648
Oh, God, no.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.441
Oh, when I was a girl,

17:05.483 --> 17:08.862
I had all these crazy,

17:05.483 --> 17:08.862
romantic dreams.

17:08.903 --> 17:10.697
I wanted to be

17:08.903 --> 17:10.697
a blackjack dealer

17:10.738 --> 17:12.699
in an Indian reservation.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.659
Didn't work out.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.076
Stubby thumbs.

17:16.118 --> 17:18.078
Well, at least

17:16.118 --> 17:18.078
you have your home

17:18.120 --> 17:19.079
and your family.

17:19.121 --> 17:20.498
All I come home to every night

17:20.540 --> 17:22.959
are three howling cats

17:20.540 --> 17:22.959
and... Bob.

17:23.001 --> 17:24.084
Who's Bob?

17:24.126 --> 17:25.336
My showerhead.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.630
(both laugh)

17:33.052 --> 17:35.388
Do you have anything stronger?

17:35.429 --> 17:37.348
I'm way ahead of you.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.392
ANNOUNCER: ...and it looks like

17:37.390 --> 17:39.392
Rusty Malcolm

17:39.433 --> 17:40.894
will win his final race!

17:40.935 --> 17:42.770
Rusty!

17:42.812 --> 17:45.105
I can't believe

17:42.812 --> 17:45.105
they're missing this.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.612
(tires screeching)

17:57.201 --> 17:59.787
(crowd clamoring)

17:57.201 --> 17:59.787
What happened?

18:00.872 --> 18:03.165
Rusty do something?

18:03.207 --> 18:04.625
Missed it!

18:04.667 --> 18:06.627
What'd he do?

18:06.669 --> 18:10.130
(metallic squeaking)

18:10.172 --> 18:15.135
Men... a terrible tragedy

18:10.172 --> 18:15.135
has befallen us.

18:15.177 --> 18:19.223
At approximately 1700 hours,

18:19.265 --> 18:22.769
our beloved Patton

18:22.810 --> 18:26.355
was set upon by a serpent

18:22.810 --> 18:26.355
and devoured.

18:26.397 --> 18:28.357
I, myself, fired

18:26.397 --> 18:28.357
a few rounds

18:28.399 --> 18:29.984
as it slithered away,

18:30.026 --> 18:32.737
but hampered by a lack

18:30.026 --> 18:32.737
of depth perception,

18:32.779 --> 18:34.864
my efforts were useless.

18:34.906 --> 18:36.783
(sniffles)

18:36.824 --> 18:40.745
Now... after an incident

18:36.824 --> 18:40.745
such as this,

18:40.787 --> 18:43.163
certain questions arise.

18:43.205 --> 18:45.165
Leaving aside for the moment

18:45.207 --> 18:49.670
why God feels the need to take

18:45.207 --> 18:49.670
away everything that I love,

18:49.712 --> 18:52.006
that leaves us

18:49.712 --> 18:52.006
with the matter of

18:52.048 --> 18:55.134
who is responsible.

18:56.886 --> 19:00.180
Can you explain that,

18:56.886 --> 19:00.180
Francis?

19:00.222 --> 19:01.849
Yes, sir. I believe

19:00.222 --> 19:01.849
you lost that finger

19:01.891 --> 19:03.810
trying to restart

19:01.891 --> 19:03.810
the school lawnmower, sir.

19:03.851 --> 19:05.561
What is  in  the hand?

19:05.603 --> 19:07.563
They appear to be

19:05.603 --> 19:07.563
Raisinettes, sir.

19:07.605 --> 19:11.567
They are snake droppings,

19:07.605 --> 19:11.567
found in your footlocker.

19:11.609 --> 19:14.236
Now, what do you

19:11.609 --> 19:14.236
have to say for yourself?

19:14.278 --> 19:17.281
Sir, I'm obviously the victim

19:14.278 --> 19:17.281
of an elaborate conspiracy

19:17.323 --> 19:18.783
to frame me.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.284
It's just too perfect, sir.

19:21.243 --> 19:23.454
Two months!

19:23.496 --> 19:25.205
No hot water, no television,

19:25.247 --> 19:28.751
and an 8:00 p.m. curfew

19:25.247 --> 19:28.751
for the entire academy.

19:30.544 --> 19:33.213
Feel free to

19:30.544 --> 19:33.213
thank the cadet

19:33.255 --> 19:35.549
after I leave.

19:37.343 --> 19:40.220
Could I ask one favor--

19:37.343 --> 19:40.220
would you send a picture

19:40.262 --> 19:43.223
to my mom with "I told you so"

19:40.262 --> 19:43.223
written across it?

19:43.265 --> 19:45.351
Yeah! Whoo!

19:43.265 --> 19:45.351
Yeah!

19:46.560 --> 19:47.687
Way to go, man!

19:47.728 --> 19:48.813
What?

19:48.855 --> 19:50.523
We hated that

19:48.855 --> 19:50.523
yappy, little rat.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.150
Let's hear it for

19:50.564 --> 19:52.150
Francis, you guys!

19:52.191 --> 19:53.651
(all cheering)

19:54.443 --> 19:56.195
(laughs)

19:58.781 --> 20:01.659
This is an improvement, right?

20:01.701 --> 20:04.662
Reese!

20:04.704 --> 20:07.331
Malcolm!

20:07.373 --> 20:08.833
(grunts)

20:08.875 --> 20:09.834
Hi, Dad.

20:09.876 --> 20:12.003
Hi. Where are your brothers?

20:16.298 --> 20:17.508
Oh, geez.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.426
Come on.

20:19.468 --> 20:22.180
Uh... what-what seems to be

20:19.468 --> 20:22.180
the trouble here,

20:22.221 --> 20:23.514
Officer, uh... Karl?

20:23.556 --> 20:26.266
These your boys?

20:23.556 --> 20:26.266
Uh, yes, sir, that they are.

20:26.308 --> 20:27.977
Fine boys. Couldn't

20:26.308 --> 20:27.977
be prouder of them.

20:28.019 --> 20:29.520
For your information,

20:28.019 --> 20:29.520
these are two of the worst kids

20:29.562 --> 20:31.355
I have ever encountered

20:29.562 --> 20:31.355
in my life.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.273
And I work the state fair.

20:33.315 --> 20:35.359
Really? See, that

20:33.315 --> 20:35.359
must be fascinating.

20:35.401 --> 20:36.944
Seeing people from all over,

20:36.986 --> 20:38.362
the different cultures...

20:36.986 --> 20:38.362
Hey!

20:38.404 --> 20:40.073
I don't want to be

20:38.404 --> 20:40.073
a hard case here,

20:40.114 --> 20:41.490
but these kids

20:40.114 --> 20:41.490
physically attacked me.

20:41.532 --> 20:43.283
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

20:41.532 --> 20:43.283
Plus, they completely destroyed

20:43.325 --> 20:46.286
a $300 pneumatic drill, which

20:43.325 --> 20:46.286
someone's going to pay for.

20:46.328 --> 20:48.664
Well, this all sounds

20:46.328 --> 20:48.664
pretty serious.

20:48.706 --> 20:51.125
But don't you worry,

20:48.706 --> 20:51.125
Officer Karl.

20:51.167 --> 20:53.794
They are gonna hear all about

20:51.167 --> 20:53.794
when I get them home. You see,

20:53.836 --> 20:55.922
I'm just sorry that they had

20:53.836 --> 20:55.922
to put you through all of this.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.381
That's not fair.

20:57.423 --> 21:00.176
And I, uh, see, I fully

20:57.423 --> 21:00.176
intend to pay for... Aah!

21:00.218 --> 21:01.594
(groans)

21:01.635 --> 21:04.013
Clyde, Kevin! Get to the car!

21:04.055 --> 21:05.223
(groaning)

21:05.264 --> 21:06.306
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

21:06.348 --> 21:09.018
Ooh!

21:09.060 --> 21:11.187
(chuckling)

21:11.229 --> 21:12.354
Okay.

21:12.396 --> 21:14.774
All right, men.

21:14.815 --> 21:18.694
Well, I hope you've all

21:14.815 --> 21:18.694
learned something today, huh?

21:18.736 --> 21:20.320
I learned my dad

21:18.736 --> 21:20.320
is actually capable

21:20.362 --> 21:22.156
of doing something cool.

21:22.198 --> 21:24.408
I'm not saying violence is cool,

21:22.198 --> 21:24.408
but  that  was cool.

21:24.450 --> 21:27.120
I always wondered

21:24.450 --> 21:27.120
where we got it from.

21:27.161 --> 21:30.289
Program... tickets...

21:31.582 --> 21:33.042
Huh.

21:33.084 --> 21:34.543
Your mother's paycheck.

21:34.585 --> 21:38.422
Now, boys, remember,

21:34.585 --> 21:38.422
as far as your mom knows...

21:38.464 --> 21:42.176
I have been at work all day.

21:42.218 --> 21:43.136
(laughing)

21:43.177 --> 21:44.344
Okay, go on.

21:44.386 --> 21:46.472
All right.

21:56.315 --> 21:59.318
Well, at least she doesn't know

21:56.315 --> 21:59.318
I skipped school all week.
