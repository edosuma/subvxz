Video is helmet cam footage
from Reynosa, Mexico.

03:47.112 --> 03:50.230
0600 today.
The home of Luis Cisneros.

03:50.232 --> 03:52.565
He took over the Molina Cartel.

03:52.567 --> 03:54.734
Built it back into an empire.

03:54.736 --> 03:55.952
He also helped Hezbollah

03:55.954 --> 03:58.071
set up training camps
south of our border.

03:58.073 --> 03:59.372
Joint Special Operations Command

03:59.374 --> 04:01.791
sent an elite unit
to capture him.

04:05.080 --> 04:06.963
But it turned into an ambush.

04:06.965 --> 04:08.431
Cisneros knew they were coming.

04:08.433 --> 04:09.916
Somebody had to leak the intel.

04:09.918 --> 04:13.186
The ambush was a symptom,
the intel leak is the disease.

04:13.188 --> 04:17.057
JSOC put all its ops on hold
until we pinpoint the breach.

04:17.059 --> 04:18.423
You have to have
Top Secret clearance

04:18.426 --> 04:19.858
to know about an op
like this.

04:19.861 --> 04:21.194
That'll narrow the list
of suspects.

04:21.196 --> 04:23.013
We cross-referenced people
with clearance

04:23.015 --> 04:24.314
against JSOC employees.

04:24.316 --> 04:27.033
We stuck to those involved
with the Cisneros op,

04:27.035 --> 04:29.703
and we ended up with the
mission's tactical role players.

04:29.705 --> 04:30.770
Who?

04:30.772 --> 04:32.105
Civilian contractors

04:32.107 --> 04:33.573
who role-play the enemy
during training.

04:33.575 --> 04:34.591
TRPs.

04:34.593 --> 04:36.176
So they mimic bad guys?

04:36.178 --> 04:38.912
They're not part of the standard
military curriculum.

04:38.914 --> 04:41.447
Only elite units
have budgets

04:41.449 --> 04:43.049
for this type of training.

04:43.051 --> 04:44.751
These are the
tactical role players

04:44.753 --> 04:46.469
who simulated Cisneros
and his men

04:46.471 --> 04:48.338
during prep
for last night's raid.

04:48.340 --> 04:50.423
I know guys who
contracted them

04:50.425 --> 04:51.975
to train
for a counter-terrorist op.

04:51.977 --> 04:54.344
After a month
in their kill house,

04:54.346 --> 04:57.463
Al Qaeda was a walk in the park.

04:57.465 --> 04:58.765
These aren't your
run-of-the-mill

04:58.767 --> 05:00.466
civilian contractors.

05:00.468 --> 05:01.518
They're ex-military,

05:01.520 --> 05:03.186
former pro fighters,
martial artists.

05:03.188 --> 05:05.605
Guys with a special affinity
for violence.

05:05.607 --> 05:06.856
I want a closer look.

05:06.858 --> 05:09.192
Undercover op
has been authorized.

05:09.194 --> 05:11.528
You'll be
a SpecOps unit prepping

05:11.530 --> 05:13.530
for another raid on Cisneros.

05:13.532 --> 05:15.081
So we're gonna go train
with guys

05:15.083 --> 05:17.584
that make Al Qaeda look like
a walk in the park?

05:17.586 --> 05:19.703
This isn't exactly going
to the gym for a pickup game.

05:19.705 --> 05:22.488
I've done this kind
of high-risk training before.

05:22.490 --> 05:24.924
Guys get injured,
some of them get killed.

05:24.926 --> 05:27.877
We knew it was a possibility.

05:27.879 --> 05:29.129
It's the only way
to get close enough

05:29.131 --> 05:30.213
to see if they're the leak.

05:30.215 --> 05:32.432
Rain on our parade?

05:32.434 --> 05:34.000
More like
a freaking tsunami.

05:34.002 --> 05:35.352
<i>If it seems like</i>

05:35.354 --> 05:37.470
the TRPs are trying
to murder you,

05:37.472 --> 05:38.805
it means they're doing
their job right.

05:38.807 --> 05:40.340
Do we get a safety word?

05:40.342 --> 05:41.391
What do you think?

05:41.393 --> 05:42.809
I was hoping
for a "yes""

05:42.811 --> 05:44.611
This isn't one
of your bondage sessions, Deeks.

05:44.613 --> 05:47.280
She's kidding, but if you
hear me yell "noodles""

05:47.282 --> 05:48.698
that means I'm in trouble.

05:48.700 --> 05:51.517
If I hear you yell "noodles,"
I'm gonna shoot you myself.

05:54.288 --> 05:58.325
The only way to get through this
in one piece

05:58.327 --> 05:59.859
is to work as a team.

05:59.861 --> 06:01.244
You'll be using

06:01.246 --> 06:05.882
weapons that have been modified
to fire Simunitions.

06:05.884 --> 06:08.001
Sims.

06:08.003 --> 06:10.136
Real bullets
with paint-filled tips

06:10.138 --> 06:11.755
that explode on impact.

06:11.757 --> 06:13.089
In the kill house,
we treat everything

06:13.091 --> 06:15.308
like a live encounter;
we respond at full speed.

06:15.310 --> 06:17.477
That means punches,
kicks, guns, knives.

06:17.479 --> 06:19.846
Great. That means we can break
in my new training blades.

06:19.848 --> 06:23.233
No edge, but, uh,
they'll leave a mark.

06:23.235 --> 06:24.550
Just to clarify,

06:24.552 --> 06:26.219
this ain't paintball.

06:26.221 --> 06:27.654
I've never
allowed myself

06:27.656 --> 06:29.522
to be shot by one of those.

06:29.524 --> 06:32.692
Mr. Deeks, I advise you
to do the same.

06:32.694 --> 06:34.027
Good luck.

06:34.029 --> 06:36.896
The TRPs are waiting.

06:45.840 --> 06:48.241
No welcoming committee?

06:48.243 --> 06:50.510
Training protocol.

06:50.512 --> 06:52.745
Keep the good guys
and bad guys separate.

07:00.638 --> 07:03.306
TRPs simulate
hostile combatants.

07:03.308 --> 07:04.724
We will treat them accordingly.

07:04.726 --> 07:06.776
Ja, crush your enemies,

07:06.778 --> 07:08.261
see them driven before you,

07:08.263 --> 07:10.146
hear the lamentations
of their women.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.234
Conan the Barbarian?

07:15.419 --> 07:16.820
What? The three of you
don't have

07:16.822 --> 07:19.038
a monopoly
on kicking ass.

07:19.040 --> 07:20.457
They've got a closed-circuit
camera network.

07:20.459 --> 07:21.791
Your button-cams
will be our eyes.

07:21.793 --> 07:23.193
Roger that, Eric.

07:23.195 --> 07:26.129
I wish we had more time to train
Kensi and Deeks before this.

07:26.131 --> 07:28.581
They're about to get tossed
into the deep end.

07:28.583 --> 07:30.250
We'll be there
to help them swim.

07:30.252 --> 07:34.620
I feel like we've been
invited to the big boy table.

07:35.473 --> 07:37.223
You nervous?

07:37.225 --> 07:40.293
No.

07:40.295 --> 07:41.761
Maybe a little.

07:41.763 --> 07:42.962
That's okay.

07:42.964 --> 07:44.431
Me, too.

07:50.921 --> 07:52.972
Let's gear up.

07:55.576 --> 08:00.363
You, uh, got any pregame cheer
for us, coach?

08:00.365 --> 08:02.081
Trust your training.

08:03.869 --> 08:06.486
Your unit has 90 seconds

08:06.488 --> 08:08.505
to secure sensitive
computer technology

08:08.507 --> 08:10.623
located inside the kill house.

08:10.625 --> 08:13.460
Commencing in three, two, one.

08:13.462 --> 08:16.162
Let's do what we do.

08:22.136 --> 08:23.219
Clock's ticking. Split up.

08:23.221 --> 08:24.554
Clear it room by room.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.726
Isolate Mr. Callen's button-cam.

10:26.427 --> 10:28.595
Laptop's secure.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.135
The drill should be over.

10:46.031 --> 10:47.280
No, don't kill me!
Don't kill me!

10:47.282 --> 10:48.998
Let go of the girl!
No!

10:53.655 --> 10:56.289
Best of the best, huh?

11:02.463 --> 11:05.715
Somewhere, Granger is laughing.

11:05.717 --> 11:08.334
Can't hear it.

11:08.336 --> 11:10.053
We're dead.

11:19.468 --> 11:22.185
Oh! It's not as bad
as getting shot for real,

11:22.187 --> 11:23.736
but I would rather
get thrown

11:23.738 --> 11:25.855
down a flight of steps
into a wall, which--

11:25.857 --> 11:28.524
in case anybody's wondering--
also happened to me today.

11:28.526 --> 11:30.293
Is that when you yelled,
"Noodles"?

11:30.295 --> 11:32.412
No.  Maybe.

11:32.414 --> 11:34.530
Could have been
a reflex reaction.

11:34.532 --> 11:35.865
I can't believe we lost.

11:35.867 --> 11:37.533
Our mission objective
wasn't clear.

11:37.535 --> 11:39.385
Was it secure
the computer technology,

11:39.387 --> 11:41.004
or rescue the hostage?

11:41.006 --> 11:44.224
If we learn from it and come
back stronger, it's not a loss.

11:44.226 --> 11:45.592
That was definitely a loss.

11:45.594 --> 11:47.877
Might even qualify
as an ass-whipping.

11:48.963 --> 11:51.014
Difference of opinion.

11:51.016 --> 11:53.382
What would Luis Cisneros
call it?

11:54.435 --> 11:57.720
Talk pretty tough
for a civilian.

11:57.722 --> 12:00.573
They're antagonizing the
TRPs to get reactions.

12:00.575 --> 12:02.859
Reactions reveal
personality traits.

12:02.861 --> 12:06.279
Traits we'll use to build
suspect profiles for this case.

12:06.281 --> 12:08.064
Hey, the paint doesn't lie.

12:08.066 --> 12:09.582
Your team fell apart.

12:09.584 --> 12:11.584
- You got smoked.
- Does anybody want

12:11.586 --> 12:15.038
to put a leah on him before
we go another round right here?

12:15.040 --> 12:17.757
Somebody's a poor loser.

12:17.759 --> 12:19.542
You take it this bad
when you got cut

12:19.544 --> 12:20.677
from the cheerleading
squad, too?

12:20.679 --> 12:22.762
What part are you
role-playing now, huh?

12:22.764 --> 12:24.714
Team super douche?

12:25.967 --> 12:27.267
How's that working out for you?

12:27.269 --> 12:29.269
Loved your little fun house,
by the way.

12:29.271 --> 12:30.520
That was a treat.

12:30.522 --> 12:32.088
It didn't help your last team,
either.

12:32.090 --> 12:33.139
Stow it, Parish.

12:33.141 --> 12:34.974
His name is Chad Parish.

12:34.976 --> 12:37.193
He's only been with the team
for two months.

12:37.195 --> 12:38.945
Former San Diego
SWAT officer.

12:38.947 --> 12:41.597
Discharged due to
insubordination.

12:41.599 --> 12:44.567
You were dead the moment
that you split up.

12:44.569 --> 12:45.985
Fragmented force.

12:45.987 --> 12:48.238
All we did was sit
and wait for you

12:48.240 --> 12:50.439
to show us how you
wanted to be killed.

12:50.441 --> 12:53.609
Your mission
objective was clear.

12:53.611 --> 12:57.046
Secure the computer technology.

12:57.048 --> 13:00.116
The computer technology
was the hostage.

13:00.118 --> 13:02.051
A human asset.

13:02.053 --> 13:03.786
The laptop was just a laptop.

13:03.788 --> 13:05.638
We were set up to fail.

13:05.640 --> 13:08.424
I like to think of it
as being set up to learn.

13:13.630 --> 13:15.131
Let's break down
the footage.

13:15.133 --> 13:16.799
You entered
to clear the house...

13:16.801 --> 13:18.484
What do we have on this man?

13:19.938 --> 13:21.237
His name is David Inman.

13:21.239 --> 13:23.239
He's a former
Force Recon Marine.

13:23.241 --> 13:25.141
Holds a master's degree
in Philosophy.

13:25.143 --> 13:26.609
He began submitting bids

13:26.611 --> 13:28.411
for TRP contract work
five years ago,

13:28.413 --> 13:30.113
and he's the group leader.

13:30.115 --> 13:31.831
Anomalies in his service record?

13:31.833 --> 13:33.917
Nothing so far.

13:33.919 --> 13:35.168
Well, keep looking.

13:35.170 --> 13:37.153
Everybody's got a weak spot.

13:37.155 --> 13:40.256
You just have to keep
cutting away until you find it.

13:40.258 --> 13:42.208
Talk me through it.

13:42.210 --> 13:43.659
The drill was over.

13:43.661 --> 13:45.878
That thinking
changed your mindset.

13:45.880 --> 13:47.630
Triggered a de-escalation
of force.

13:47.632 --> 13:49.665
We took a beat to transition

13:49.667 --> 13:51.551
from assault
to hostage rescue mode.

13:51.553 --> 13:53.937
That beat was a lapse
in team unity.

13:53.939 --> 13:55.805
I am seeing

13:55.807 --> 13:58.808
four separate operators,
not a team.

13:58.810 --> 14:00.843
Inman's single,
no immediate family.

14:00.845 --> 14:05.014
In fact, all the TRPs are
Parish.

14:05.016 --> 14:06.449
You hesitated.

14:06.451 --> 14:08.701
You let us inside
your reactionary gap.

14:08.703 --> 14:10.069
Game over.

14:10.071 --> 14:11.487
Same thing

14:11.489 --> 14:12.789
probably happened to the unit

14:12.791 --> 14:14.290
Cisneros wiped out in Mexico.

14:14.292 --> 14:16.326
Enough.

14:17.461 --> 14:19.528
We're going off-site

14:19.530 --> 14:20.663
for the next session.

14:20.665 --> 14:22.799
Location and objective
will be uploaded

14:22.801 --> 14:25.001
to your cell phones.

14:36.713 --> 14:39.766
Okay, Parish lives
with his wife in Los Feliz.

14:39.768 --> 14:42.935
Medical records indicate
she's three months pregnant.

14:45.489 --> 14:47.674
Parish mentioned Cisneros
twice back there.

14:47.676 --> 14:49.392
Wasn't by accident.

14:49.394 --> 14:51.327
He was watching to
see how we'd react.

14:51.329 --> 14:53.997
Clearly trying to push our
buttons, get a read on us.

14:53.999 --> 14:56.449
Maybe he's the one
who leaked the intel.

14:56.451 --> 14:58.951
Or maybe he knows who did
and wants a way out.

14:58.953 --> 15:01.070
File says he's
got a baby coming.

15:01.072 --> 15:03.456
New mouth to feed could
be financial motivation.

15:03.458 --> 15:06.626
It could also be a
reason to stay clean.

15:06.628 --> 15:09.512
We got to separate him
from the rest of the TRPs,

15:09.514 --> 15:11.514
have a talk.

15:11.516 --> 15:13.516
Parish was right
about one thing.

15:13.518 --> 15:15.418
They kicked our asses in there.

15:15.420 --> 15:18.438
Inman picked us apart
during the debrief.

15:18.440 --> 15:20.690
These guys are high-speed.

15:23.361 --> 15:25.478
What's wrong?

15:25.480 --> 15:29.115
Well, my spleen, a couple
vertebraes, for starters.

15:29.117 --> 15:31.600
And then there's death,
taxes, babies on airplanes.

15:31.602 --> 15:33.319
You want a massage?

15:33.321 --> 15:35.388
Yes.

15:35.390 --> 15:37.407
Oh. What about Sam and Callen?

15:37.409 --> 15:38.624
They may think
it's inappropriate,

15:38.626 --> 15:40.109
open-plan,
workspace behavior,

15:40.111 --> 15:42.778
but I do have a little bit
right here.

15:42.780 --> 15:44.380
It's just really tight.

15:44.382 --> 15:46.282
If you want to just get that...

15:46.284 --> 15:48.234
I now see

15:48.236 --> 15:49.719
that you're-you're mocking me,
but I don't really care,

15:49.721 --> 15:51.120
'cause I have this knot.
If you could just maybe

15:51.122 --> 15:53.089
get a thumb in there?

15:53.091 --> 15:54.424
Aah! Fraggle Rock.

15:54.426 --> 15:55.742
What was that?

15:55.744 --> 15:57.677
A distraction injury.

15:57.679 --> 15:59.962
See, now you don't
feel the knot.

16:00.764 --> 16:02.715
So you were doing me
a favor then?

16:02.717 --> 16:03.883
Was that the plan there?

16:03.885 --> 16:06.736
'Cause, uh...
yeah, no, that still hurts.

16:08.756 --> 16:10.973
I recognize this place.

16:10.975 --> 16:12.442
They closed it
a year ago.

16:12.444 --> 16:14.160
Looks like they papered
over the windows.

16:14.162 --> 16:16.829
Yeah, JSOC contracted Inman and
his guys to modify the layout.

16:16.831 --> 16:18.831
It matches
Cisneros' favorite restaurant.

16:18.833 --> 16:20.500
All right, now, guys,
our objective is

16:20.502 --> 16:22.585
to enter the building,
locate the role-player Cisneros,

16:22.587 --> 16:23.786
and take him alive.

16:23.788 --> 16:25.088
How do we recognize him?

16:25.090 --> 16:26.539
Red tactical vest.

16:26.541 --> 16:27.673
What do we do
after we snatch him?

16:27.675 --> 16:28.824
Move him to our vehicle

16:28.826 --> 16:30.009
and get the hell out of Dodge.

16:30.011 --> 16:31.994
Target will have security,
same as the real thing.

16:31.996 --> 16:33.546
The TRPs may throw us
some curves,

16:33.548 --> 16:34.714
so, expect the unexpected.

16:34.716 --> 16:36.799
Let's do it.

16:39.853 --> 16:41.854
Hey.

16:41.856 --> 16:45.024
Let's forget about the
kill house this morning.

16:45.026 --> 16:48.511
As far as any of us are
concerned, it never happened.

16:48.513 --> 16:50.613
Seriously?
Thought you were gonna go

16:50.615 --> 16:53.232
all Vince Lombardi on it.
That's all we get?

16:56.186 --> 16:57.653
Okay.

16:57.655 --> 16:59.822
Let's do it.

17:13.369 --> 17:16.105
I'll be right with you.

17:16.107 --> 17:18.223
Noncombatant,
civilian role-players.

17:18.226 --> 17:19.559
No casualties.

17:19.560 --> 17:22.094
Target acquired.
Sam's eleven o'clock.

17:23.763 --> 17:25.097
Oh, my God, they've got guns!

17:28.686 --> 17:29.519
Deeks?

17:29.521 --> 17:30.886
With pleasure.

17:40.365 --> 17:41.897
Stay down!

17:53.093 --> 17:54.093
Deeks, move!

17:54.095 --> 17:55.461
Yeah!
Go!

17:55.463 --> 17:56.712
Get out!

17:56.714 --> 17:58.514
Move!
Go! Go!

17:58.516 --> 17:59.915
Parking lot!

18:02.553 --> 18:04.637
Get in there.

18:07.774 --> 18:09.742
In. Go.

18:09.744 --> 18:11.727
We got a problem?

18:11.729 --> 18:13.529
Car won't start.

18:13.531 --> 18:14.814
Key doesn't work.

18:14.816 --> 18:16.315
Got to go now!

18:16.317 --> 18:18.067
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

18:18.069 --> 18:20.369
They swapped the vehicle.

18:20.371 --> 18:21.704
Cover your eyes!

18:21.706 --> 18:23.539
Go!
Go! Move!

18:26.794 --> 18:28.494
Tear gas? Seriously?

18:28.496 --> 18:30.880
Medic!

18:30.882 --> 18:32.932
Medic! Medic!

18:32.934 --> 18:34.634
Get this mask off me.

18:34.636 --> 18:36.702
Cut me loose. Take 'em off.

18:36.704 --> 18:38.170
What happened?

18:38.172 --> 18:40.640
It's one of
our guys.

18:40.642 --> 18:43.559
This is real, G.

18:46.764 --> 18:48.097
Talk to me, Inman.

18:48.099 --> 18:50.233
What is it?

18:50.235 --> 18:52.235
It's Parish.

18:52.237 --> 18:54.437
He's dead.

19:05.874 --> 19:10.292
LAPD thinks we're a JSOC unit
here on a training exercise.

19:10.392 --> 19:12.945
Parish suffered a broken neck
from a bad fall.

19:12.947 --> 19:14.330
Accident or murder?

19:14.332 --> 19:17.166
We won't know till we get
a closer look at the scene.

19:17.168 --> 19:19.969
But even if Inman's crew was
behind it, we still need proof.

19:19.971 --> 19:22.305
Eric, I want to see the video
cameras from this restaurant.

19:22.307 --> 19:24.290
Mm, closed-circuit network,
no access.

19:24.292 --> 19:26.676
But there might be a solution.

19:26.678 --> 19:28.895
I'll keep you guys posted.

19:28.897 --> 19:30.813
Inman's guys
could make foul play

19:30.815 --> 19:32.482
look like a fatal slip and fall.

19:32.484 --> 19:34.934
I mean, the military hires them
to deceive elite SpecOps units.

19:34.936 --> 19:37.070
They could do this
with their eyes closed.

19:37.072 --> 19:38.905
Well, looks like
Parish wasn't the leak.

19:38.907 --> 19:40.106
Or he <i>was</i> the leak,

19:40.108 --> 19:42.025
and Inman wanted
to take care of it internally.

19:42.027 --> 19:43.860
If you want
to get rid of Parish,

19:43.862 --> 19:46.479
you doing it right here and now
makes the perfect alibi.

19:46.481 --> 19:48.781
How are you
holding up?

19:48.783 --> 19:50.950
My guys are shaken
up pretty badly.

19:50.952 --> 19:52.368
I mean, I'm shaken up, too.

19:52.370 --> 19:54.620
Parish wasn't the most
popular guy in the tribe,

19:54.622 --> 19:56.255
but he was still one of us.

19:56.257 --> 19:57.823
Is this the first man
you've lost?

19:57.825 --> 19:59.825
In training, yeah.

19:59.827 --> 20:01.660
We're cutting this
contract short.

20:01.662 --> 20:03.513
I want to see what
LAPD turns up,

20:03.515 --> 20:05.298
and then, I'm gonna conduct
my own investigation

20:05.300 --> 20:07.216
before going back to work.

20:07.218 --> 20:09.218
I'm sorry.
We understand.

20:09.220 --> 20:12.388
Command will find another
TRP unit for your training.

20:12.390 --> 20:15.942
And for the record,
I hope that you nail Cisneros.

20:15.944 --> 20:18.728
Those men he killed
were friends of mine.

20:21.648 --> 20:23.116
Kens?
Yeah?

20:23.118 --> 20:25.401
Why don't you and Deeks take
the SUV and follow him?

20:25.403 --> 20:26.452
See where he goes.

20:26.454 --> 20:27.954
What about you guys?

20:27.956 --> 20:29.572
We have a crime scene to work.

20:29.574 --> 20:30.689
Okay.

20:30.691 --> 20:32.024
On it.

20:32.026 --> 20:34.377
<i>Well, good.</i>

20:35.462 --> 20:37.713
Yeah, I'll be in the boatshed
in 20 minutes.

20:37.715 --> 20:40.032
Bring him in.

20:48.041 --> 20:49.642
Are you going to ask

20:49.644 --> 20:52.562
or just wait for me to melt
under your Gorgon stare?

20:52.564 --> 20:56.849
Men don't melt
under Gorgon stares.

20:56.851 --> 20:59.435
They turn to stone.

21:02.889 --> 21:05.441
So, who are you bringing in?

21:05.443 --> 21:07.193
David Inman.

21:07.195 --> 21:09.328
If he knows
we're investigating him,

21:09.330 --> 21:11.280
it compromises our mission.

21:11.282 --> 21:12.915
This mission was compromised

21:12.917 --> 21:16.068
the moment Parish
got his neck broken.

21:24.094 --> 21:25.428
Jenna.

21:25.430 --> 21:26.745
Hey.
Hi.

21:26.747 --> 21:29.182
Inman came straight
to Parish's house.

21:29.184 --> 21:30.933
Consoling
Parish's wife,

21:30.935 --> 21:33.553
who is now a widow

21:33.555 --> 21:35.605
and three months
pregnant.

21:35.607 --> 21:38.641
It's going to take
a while.

21:38.643 --> 21:41.027
Kens?

21:41.029 --> 21:42.278
Yep?

21:42.280 --> 21:44.263
What's in the box?

21:44.265 --> 21:46.866
This again?

21:46.868 --> 21:48.651
Fine. You don't want me to ask,
I'll stop asking.

21:48.653 --> 21:50.203
I don't care.
I don't need to know.

21:50.205 --> 21:52.121
No, I just think you're
very curious, that's all.

21:52.123 --> 21:53.706
Because you keeping
building it up so much.

21:53.708 --> 21:56.209
Exactly. What's to say it won't
be a big disappointment?

21:56.211 --> 21:58.377
Well, at least
then we'll know.

21:58.379 --> 22:00.329
Kens.

22:00.331 --> 22:02.114
What's in the box?

22:02.116 --> 22:05.218
No. The stakes
are too high.

22:06.721 --> 22:08.681
You know it's not going to
change anything, right?

22:09.556 --> 22:11.841
We're still talking
about the box, right?

22:13.594 --> 22:15.895
It's almost as if you
sent it to yourself

22:15.897 --> 22:18.731
so we could have this
exact conversation.

22:18.733 --> 22:20.566
Oh, my God,
you're diabolical.

22:20.568 --> 22:21.967
You did send it to
yourself, didn't you?

22:21.969 --> 22:24.153
Get away from me!

22:24.155 --> 22:25.438
Jenna!

22:25.440 --> 22:27.156
Looks like that
didn't go over well.

22:27.158 --> 22:28.741
Yeah, it usually doesn't.

22:30.161 --> 22:32.478
Yeah.

22:32.480 --> 22:34.697
All right, we gotta talk to her
while it's still fresh.

22:34.699 --> 22:36.148
Yeah, if she's angry
at Inman,

22:36.150 --> 22:38.000
it's the perfect time
to ask for her help.

22:38.002 --> 22:39.818
I should have
hit him harder.

22:47.161 --> 22:49.378
Jenna Parish?

22:49.380 --> 22:50.880
Yeah?

22:50.882 --> 22:52.515
NCIS.

22:52.517 --> 22:54.884
We're investigating
your husband's death.

22:57.888 --> 22:59.505
We need to know

22:59.507 --> 23:01.941
everything about your
husband and these TRPs.

23:01.943 --> 23:05.111
Maybe it'd help prove that
his death wasn't an accident.

23:06.313 --> 23:08.948
Chad was the black sheep
of that group.

23:10.701 --> 23:12.351
Not because of his skills.

23:12.353 --> 23:14.320
It was his personal life.

23:14.322 --> 23:16.021
Him and me.

23:16.023 --> 23:17.623
What do you mean?

23:17.625 --> 23:21.043
How many of Inman's guys
are married?

23:22.496 --> 23:24.196
How many of them have kids?

23:24.198 --> 23:26.716
Right. None of them.

23:26.718 --> 23:29.385
All they care about
is their so-called tribe.

23:29.387 --> 23:31.587
And when they're not
training the military,

23:31.589 --> 23:34.974
they're training each other
20 hours a day.

23:34.976 --> 23:36.759
There's always
a new skill to learn

23:36.761 --> 23:38.311
or a new scenario to design.

23:38.313 --> 23:40.546
The way of the warrior.

23:40.548 --> 23:43.399
You can relate to them.

23:43.401 --> 23:45.151
Yes, but we
also know

23:45.153 --> 23:47.653
how much you
have to give up

23:47.655 --> 23:49.221
to live that way,

23:49.223 --> 23:50.823
and it doesn't seem
like your husband

23:50.825 --> 23:53.242
was ready to
go that far.

23:54.528 --> 23:56.862
Chad talked about
quitting every day,

23:56.864 --> 24:00.032
but we needed the money.

24:00.034 --> 24:01.450
Things were only
going to get worse

24:01.452 --> 24:03.202
with their new
training center.

24:04.921 --> 24:07.039
What new training center?

24:07.041 --> 24:08.924
Inman's building some...

24:08.926 --> 24:12.345
high-tech place in New Mexico.

24:12.347 --> 24:15.298
Chad said that it was
Inman's dream project.

24:20.520 --> 24:22.722
So, what have you guys found
so far?

24:22.724 --> 24:24.557
Well, we got six cameras
in this room

24:24.559 --> 24:26.025
that may or may not
have been active

24:26.027 --> 24:27.426
during the training run.

24:27.428 --> 24:29.445
Now, we're thinking that Parish
could have been murdered

24:29.447 --> 24:30.896
because he didn't want to go
along with leaking intel.

24:30.898 --> 24:32.114
If there's footage,

24:32.116 --> 24:33.899
we need to see it.

24:33.901 --> 24:34.933
Parish died right there.

24:34.935 --> 24:36.902
Body wasn't moved.

24:36.904 --> 24:37.987
Well, then it may not matter

24:37.989 --> 24:39.205
whether the cameras
were active or not.

24:39.207 --> 24:41.490
Give me a second.

24:41.492 --> 24:43.492
Maybe two.

24:44.628 --> 24:46.662
Okay, so CCTV cameras

24:46.664 --> 24:49.131
with 16-millimeter lenses.

24:49.133 --> 24:52.301
That means 16-foot
widths of view

24:52.303 --> 24:55.721
at 22.3 feet.

24:56.956 --> 25:00.593
Can I ask you guys a question?

25:01.294 --> 25:02.311
Go ahead.

25:02.313 --> 25:06.482
Um, when do you stop
being afraid of...

25:06.484 --> 25:09.485
you know, busting into places,
guns blazing?

25:10.270 --> 25:13.439
When you trust your training.

25:14.908 --> 25:17.660
That's easier said than done.

25:17.662 --> 25:19.245
Back in the day,

25:19.247 --> 25:21.113
Hetty flew in
an old friend of hers,

25:21.115 --> 25:23.499
and, uh...

25:23.501 --> 25:26.151
he didn't look like much,
didn't say much.

25:28.004 --> 25:30.172
Then, one day, she told us
the truth about who he was.

25:30.174 --> 25:32.758
He was a headhunter--
literally.

25:32.760 --> 25:35.160
He descended from a
tribe of headhunters

25:35.162 --> 25:36.278
in the Philippines.

25:36.280 --> 25:37.680
The Kalinga.

25:37.682 --> 25:39.265
His father trained him.

25:39.267 --> 25:41.133
His grandfather
trained his father.

25:41.135 --> 25:43.302
The way they fought
was passed down like that

25:43.304 --> 25:44.603
for hundreds of years.

25:44.605 --> 25:46.639
Everything they taught
was battle-tested.

25:46.641 --> 25:49.058
The tribe spilled its blood
until they got it right.

25:49.060 --> 25:50.843
That's why the Kalinga
have no fear.

25:50.845 --> 25:52.678
He trusted his training.

25:52.680 --> 25:54.213
When he drew
his weapon,

25:54.215 --> 25:55.781
it wasn't just
with one hand.

25:55.783 --> 25:58.484
10,000 hands
drew that weapon with him.

25:59.536 --> 26:02.571
And Hetty flew
a Kalinga headhunter

26:02.573 --> 26:05.658
to Los Angeles
to tell you guys that?

26:06.493 --> 26:09.361
Maybe she did it
so we could tell you.

26:10.180 --> 26:11.464
Hmm.

26:11.466 --> 26:15.534
There is one camera blind spot
in this room.

26:15.536 --> 26:17.803
Parish died in it.

26:18.839 --> 26:20.840
We need proof he was murdered.

26:20.842 --> 26:22.808
If I can access
the network directly,

26:22.810 --> 26:24.310
I may be able to determine

26:24.312 --> 26:26.429
who was closest to him
when he died.

26:29.433 --> 26:30.816
It's Hetty.

26:30.818 --> 26:32.184
Yeah?

26:32.186 --> 26:34.353
Mr. Callen, you and Mr. Hanna
better get back here.

26:34.355 --> 26:35.738
Why?

26:35.740 --> 26:37.823
Assistant Director Granger
has taken

26:37.825 --> 26:39.408
David Inman to the boatshed.

26:39.410 --> 26:40.910
We're coming now.

26:40.912 --> 26:43.162
Granger's about
to interrogate Inman.

26:43.164 --> 26:44.563
Go through the camera footage.

26:44.565 --> 26:45.831
Let us know what you find.

26:45.833 --> 26:47.082
Okay.
All right?

26:47.084 --> 26:48.667
Yeah, I'm on it.

26:59.847 --> 27:02.047
What the hell is this?

27:04.100 --> 27:05.935
Exactly what it looks like.

27:05.937 --> 27:08.387
You actually think
that I had something to do

27:08.389 --> 27:10.439
with Parish getting killed?

27:10.441 --> 27:12.191
No, I don't.

27:12.193 --> 27:14.477
Didn't anyone ever
tell you that a warrior

27:14.479 --> 27:16.612
wouldn't be caught dead
in a tailored suit?

27:16.614 --> 27:19.431
Yeah, you did,
long time ago.

27:19.433 --> 27:20.616
Too long.

27:20.618 --> 27:22.485
Good to see you again,
Granger.

27:25.104 --> 27:27.490
You, too, pal.

27:46.105 --> 27:48.106
Is this an interrogation
or a date?

27:48.108 --> 27:50.525
Inman's former Force Recon.

27:50.527 --> 27:53.194
Force Recon was Granger's
unit of choice

27:53.196 --> 27:55.113
for black ops.

27:57.951 --> 27:59.067
What's up, Callen?

27:59.069 --> 28:00.418
Eric, run
a deeper search

28:00.420 --> 28:01.653
on Inman's
military record.

28:01.655 --> 28:03.154
Look for any connection
to Granger,

28:03.156 --> 28:04.572
no matter how tangential.

28:04.574 --> 28:06.524
I have a hunch
we'll find something.

28:06.526 --> 28:07.859
Do tell.

28:07.861 --> 28:09.411
Granger was here when we ran

28:09.413 --> 28:10.879
the first series
of background checks

28:10.881 --> 28:12.247
on the tactical role players.

28:12.249 --> 28:13.665
He singled out Inman

28:13.667 --> 28:16.134
and specifically asked
if we found any anomalies

28:16.136 --> 28:17.218
in his military history.

28:17.220 --> 28:18.970
Making sure his own ass
was covered.

28:21.557 --> 28:24.726
Two months of Inman's service
has been heavily redacted.

28:24.728 --> 28:27.044
Time frame coincides
with a mission

28:27.046 --> 28:28.212
that Granger ran in Iran.

28:28.214 --> 28:29.714
You want to do the honors?

28:29.716 --> 28:31.933
With pleasure.

28:38.691 --> 28:39.991
Yeah?

28:39.993 --> 28:41.225
I have a question.

28:41.227 --> 28:43.695
You got ten seconds
before I walk in there

28:43.697 --> 28:45.897
and ask you face-to-face.

28:48.117 --> 28:50.418
Excuse me.

28:56.225 --> 28:57.742
What was your question?

28:57.744 --> 28:59.427
Why the hell
didn't you tell us

28:59.429 --> 29:00.912
you were friends
with Inman?

29:00.914 --> 29:02.881
Because your team thinks
I'm public enemy number one,

29:02.883 --> 29:05.049
and I wanted you to investigate
him with an unbiased

29:05.051 --> 29:06.301
point of view.
That's no excuse.

29:06.303 --> 29:08.219
If you weren't public enemy
number one before,

29:08.221 --> 29:09.471
you're getting pretty close.

29:09.473 --> 29:11.106
Have I ever pulled
rank on you guys?

29:11.108 --> 29:12.640
'Cause that's what
I'm doing right now.

29:12.642 --> 29:16.144
So, both of you,
have a seat,

29:16.146 --> 29:18.113
keep watching.

29:18.115 --> 29:20.315
Just might learn something.

29:25.572 --> 29:28.289
I found Inman's new facility.

29:28.291 --> 29:29.941
That was fast.

29:29.943 --> 29:31.543
Jenna Parish
told you

29:31.545 --> 29:33.711
that it was being built
in New Mexico, so I took

29:33.713 --> 29:34.913
the square footage
of the kill house

29:34.915 --> 29:35.964
that you trained
in today,

29:35.966 --> 29:37.715
and I calculated the
size of the biggest

29:37.717 --> 29:39.384
and best facility
that money could buy.

29:39.386 --> 29:41.753
There's got to be a lot
of properties that match that.

29:41.755 --> 29:43.338
Three, to be exact.

29:43.340 --> 29:45.723
Uh, two are for tract housing,

29:45.725 --> 29:47.625
but the third
is constructing both indoor

29:47.627 --> 29:49.928
and outdoor shooting ranges,
and being paid for

29:49.930 --> 29:52.347
entirely with cash.

29:52.349 --> 29:55.299
So far, Inman has
sunk in $2.3 million.

29:55.301 --> 29:58.570
There's no way his military
contract work could cover that.

29:58.572 --> 30:00.321
Who's bankrolling it?

30:00.323 --> 30:02.740
That's where the trail ends.

30:02.742 --> 30:04.409
We both know
you didn't have

30:04.411 --> 30:06.444
anything to do with
Parish's death.

30:06.446 --> 30:09.914
Accidents are a fact of life
in high-risk training.

30:09.916 --> 30:11.533
You understand.

30:11.535 --> 30:13.952
You know what it's like
to get your hands dirty.

30:14.987 --> 30:18.289
Cisneros knew an American
unit was coming for him.

30:18.291 --> 30:19.791
Who do you
think told him?

30:19.793 --> 30:21.158
I don't know.

30:21.160 --> 30:23.962
Like I said, those men who died
were good friends of mine.

30:23.964 --> 30:26.347
I'm going to level
with you, Inman.

30:26.349 --> 30:28.883
That team you trained
today were my people.

30:31.220 --> 30:34.171
I ordered them to keep
that information from you.

30:34.173 --> 30:36.975
Something about them felt off.

30:36.977 --> 30:39.343
After the Cisneros op went bad,

30:39.345 --> 30:41.729
JSOC wasn't going to give you
a new contract,

30:41.731 --> 30:43.398
but I vouched for you.

30:43.400 --> 30:45.850
Told them you were
the best team out there.

30:45.852 --> 30:47.569
Wasn't a lie.

30:47.571 --> 30:49.454
I needed you
to get my people sharp.

30:49.456 --> 30:51.072
They're deploying soon.

30:51.074 --> 30:53.324
That's what I was trying
to do out there today.

30:53.326 --> 30:55.543
Yeah, well, you blew it, Inman.

30:55.545 --> 30:57.078
Granger, come on...
Shut up!

30:57.080 --> 31:01.132
I vouched for you,
and now we got a dead TRP.

31:03.201 --> 31:05.336
I have solid intel
about where Cisneros

31:05.338 --> 31:07.472
is going to be in 72 hours,

31:07.474 --> 31:08.806
but thanks to this,

31:08.808 --> 31:11.593
I don't have a team
prepared to go after him.

31:15.748 --> 31:17.265
I didn't even see what happened.

31:17.267 --> 31:18.516
I was outside.

31:18.518 --> 31:20.435
Granger doesn't know
where Cisneros is going to be.

31:20.437 --> 31:23.721
He's playing Inman the
same way he played us.

31:23.723 --> 31:25.657
Granger's betting
that Inman

31:25.659 --> 31:27.825
will leak that
intel to Cisneros.

31:32.081 --> 31:34.282
Granger's a son of a bitch.

31:34.284 --> 31:36.834
Yeah, but he's
a tricky son of a bitch.

31:36.836 --> 31:38.486
What, Eric?

31:38.488 --> 31:41.623
Granger may not know
where Cisneros is, but we do.

31:41.625 --> 31:44.509
TSA at John Wayne Airport
just reported a businessman

31:44.511 --> 31:47.679
passing through immigration
using a Brazilian passport.

31:47.681 --> 31:51.082
The biometric scans
match up with Cisneros.

31:51.934 --> 31:53.685
He's too good to trip an alert.

31:53.687 --> 31:56.087
When does a guy
of that caliber get sloppy?

31:56.089 --> 31:58.640
When he's in a hurry.

31:59.758 --> 32:02.593
Cisneros is in Los Angeles?

32:02.595 --> 32:04.195
Yeah.
Who's watching Inman?

32:04.197 --> 32:05.396
I cut him loose.

32:05.398 --> 32:07.532
Left enough overwatch
residue on him

32:07.534 --> 32:08.983
to spot him from outer space.

32:08.985 --> 32:11.986
Confirmed. We've got Inman,
and he's on the move.

32:12.838 --> 32:14.822
Told you
you might learn something.

32:14.824 --> 32:16.457
Let's get back to Cisneros.

32:16.459 --> 32:18.459
He's in L.A.,
and he's moving quickly enough

32:18.461 --> 32:20.128
to let his tradecraft slip. Why?

32:20.130 --> 32:21.746
Well, the TRPs
were told that they

32:21.748 --> 32:23.798
were training us
to take a shot at him.

32:23.800 --> 32:25.166
Could be related to that.

32:25.168 --> 32:26.718
Guys, Inman's headed back

32:26.720 --> 32:28.219
to the TRPs'
kill house facility.

32:28.221 --> 32:29.587
The TRPs have broken ground

32:29.589 --> 32:30.955
on a state-of-the-art
compound in New Mexico.

32:30.957 --> 32:32.456
We also know
that they have paid

32:32.458 --> 32:33.474
for their services in cash.

32:33.476 --> 32:34.842
And this is cash
they shouldn't have

32:34.844 --> 32:36.227
unless it's coming
through the black market

32:36.229 --> 32:37.461
from a guy like Cisneros.

32:37.463 --> 32:40.431
If Parish wasn't on board
with the intel leak,

32:40.433 --> 32:42.817
then Inman's plan was at risk.

32:42.819 --> 32:44.902
Okay, we've seen these guys'
profiles-- they're tight.

32:44.904 --> 32:47.572
If one of them is in on it,
they probably all are.

32:47.574 --> 32:49.991
We still have to prove
that Inman killed Parish.

32:49.993 --> 32:52.410
Has Nell found any evidence
on the TRPs' camera network?

32:52.412 --> 32:54.028
I haven't heard from her.

32:54.030 --> 32:56.280
Well, get her on the
phone right now.

32:56.282 --> 32:58.482
She should have
checked in by now.

33:01.037 --> 33:02.620
Come on. Pick up.

33:02.622 --> 33:05.256
Nell, pick up.

33:07.042 --> 33:08.843
Her cell phone's off-line.

33:08.845 --> 33:10.661
We left Nell in that restaurant.

33:10.663 --> 33:12.313
What if Inman's guys found her?

33:12.315 --> 33:14.215
Then Cisneros has a chance

33:14.217 --> 33:16.517
to acquire something
bigger than intel--

33:16.519 --> 33:18.436
a human asset.

33:18.438 --> 33:20.421
Just like the
first exercise.

33:20.423 --> 33:22.857
Inman thinks we're a unit
assigned to find Cisneros.

33:22.859 --> 33:25.843
If he had a chance to snatch
one of our team members...

33:25.845 --> 33:27.511
You don't think...

33:28.897 --> 33:31.532
He's got Nell.

33:40.968 --> 33:45.788
Escalades... suits, AKs.

33:45.790 --> 33:49.926
Fits the profile of
the Molina Cartel.

33:49.928 --> 33:52.628
If Inman's got Nell, he won't
let her out of his sight.

33:52.630 --> 33:54.214
He's definitely
still in there.

33:54.216 --> 33:55.631
Roger that.

33:56.467 --> 33:58.568
If Ms. Jones is harmed

33:58.570 --> 34:00.487
because you let Inman go...

34:00.489 --> 34:02.472
I'm not the one who decided
to send her into the field.

34:02.474 --> 34:03.806
That's on you.

34:03.808 --> 34:07.277
Guys... all that matters now
is getting her back safely.

34:07.279 --> 34:10.112
<i>The long guns stay here.</i>

34:10.114 --> 34:12.614
Those kill house
walls are paper-thin.

34:12.617 --> 34:15.318
5.56 rounds would turn 'em
into Swiss cheese.

34:15.320 --> 34:17.370
Can't afford to lose Nell
to friendly fire.

34:17.371 --> 34:19.839
Then we get surgical.

34:19.841 --> 34:21.341
Blades and sigs.

34:21.342 --> 34:22.992
Okay, you guys couldn't
see it from up there,

34:22.994 --> 34:24.878
but she definitely had
a twinkle in her eye

34:24.880 --> 34:26.045
when she said that.

34:26.047 --> 34:28.431
We got the cartel guys
plus the five TRPs.

34:28.433 --> 34:29.882
Remember how
they operate--

34:29.885 --> 34:31.467
wait for us to make
the obvious choices,

34:31.469 --> 34:32.936
then they knock us
off-balance.

34:32.938 --> 34:34.270
We're not gonna
overpower 'em,

34:34.272 --> 34:35.271
we outsmart 'em.

34:35.273 --> 34:36.389
They'll be expecting us.

34:36.391 --> 34:38.641
Take 'em quietly.

35:05.869 --> 35:08.922
♪

35:17.982 --> 35:19.315
Inman, we got company.

35:19.317 --> 35:20.716
Go, go, go.

36:01.308 --> 36:02.275
You good?

36:02.277 --> 36:04.477
Yeah.

36:05.813 --> 36:08.064
Ready?
Yep, go.

36:14.605 --> 36:16.823
Nell's got to
be upstairs.

36:53.477 --> 36:56.646
Really, a machete?

37:00.584 --> 37:02.836
Inman?

37:03.821 --> 37:06.155
Inman, is that you?

37:13.830 --> 37:15.998
Come here.

37:16.967 --> 37:18.968
Luis Cisneros?

37:18.970 --> 37:21.137
Turn around.

37:26.727 --> 37:28.778
Where's Inman?

37:37.522 --> 37:38.705
Where's Inman?!

37:38.707 --> 37:40.657
He has the girl.

37:40.659 --> 37:42.692
Inman, don't move.

37:45.629 --> 37:46.963
I don't have a shot.

37:46.965 --> 37:47.747
I don't either.

37:47.749 --> 37:49.031
Do you?

37:50.551 --> 37:52.368
I didn't think so.

37:52.370 --> 37:53.369
Inman.

37:53.371 --> 37:55.638
Your move.

37:55.640 --> 37:57.590
No, it's not.

38:06.400 --> 38:07.883
You okay?

38:07.885 --> 38:10.069
Yeah.

38:13.724 --> 38:16.442
That has got to be the
first and last time

38:16.444 --> 38:20.413
a hostage has ever de-magged
her captor during a standoff.

38:20.415 --> 38:22.749
That was awesome.

38:22.751 --> 38:24.417
How'd you do that?

38:26.570 --> 38:28.755
I trusted my training.

38:32.576 --> 38:34.594
Come here.

38:49.693 --> 38:51.728
You're never leaving
the Ops Center again, ever.

38:51.730 --> 38:53.980
You know that, right?

38:53.982 --> 38:55.898
I'm sorry, what do you mean?

38:55.900 --> 38:58.284
Okay, maybe that was
a little dramatic.

38:58.286 --> 39:01.604
No, that was very dramatic,
Mr. Beale.

39:03.824 --> 39:05.908
It's just that...

39:05.910 --> 39:08.628
we make a good team.

39:08.630 --> 39:11.464
We make an awesome team.

39:13.751 --> 39:16.419
But I don't know, what if I do?

39:16.421 --> 39:18.137
Do what?

39:18.139 --> 39:20.223
Leave Ops some day.

39:20.225 --> 39:23.926
It's not happening
any time soon.

39:23.928 --> 39:26.179
I have a long way to go
before I can keep up

39:26.181 --> 39:27.897
with guys like Callen and Sam,
but it's...

39:27.899 --> 39:30.933
You're gonna
get your chance.

39:30.935 --> 39:33.135
And when you do,

39:33.137 --> 39:35.488
I'll be the first one
to tell you to take it.

39:36.974 --> 39:38.441
Drama queen.

39:38.443 --> 39:40.860
Me?

39:40.862 --> 39:43.813
Come on.

39:47.418 --> 39:50.119
Some tea, Mr. Callen?

39:50.121 --> 39:52.121
It's over.

39:52.123 --> 39:54.874
I'm afraid you'll have
to be more specific.

39:54.876 --> 39:57.260
Granger and us.

39:58.629 --> 40:01.180
He almost got Nell killed today.

40:01.182 --> 40:05.000
As much as I'd like
to blame him,

40:05.002 --> 40:07.854
it wasn't entirely his doing.

40:07.856 --> 40:10.172
I still don't want him
around my team.

40:10.174 --> 40:12.558
Your team?

40:14.445 --> 40:16.696
Our team.

40:19.850 --> 40:23.369
You know,
you look at Owen Granger,

40:23.371 --> 40:26.355
and you see
a ruthless manipulator.

40:26.357 --> 40:29.625
I look at him,

40:29.627 --> 40:33.713
and I see a man who's spent
so many years alone

40:33.715 --> 40:37.383
he's forgotten
how to ask for help.

40:49.713 --> 40:53.382
It's hard to find good friends
in our line of work.

40:55.218 --> 40:58.020
It's hard to find them anywhere.

40:58.022 --> 41:00.456
Good night, Hetty.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.608
Good night, Mr. Callen.

41:23.130 --> 41:25.465
I wasn't honest
with all of you today.

41:27.468 --> 41:29.802
And while the realities
of my job prevent me

41:29.804 --> 41:31.921
from giving you my word
it'll never happen again,

41:31.923 --> 41:33.806
I'm sorry it put your team
at risk.

41:36.226 --> 41:37.944
Fair enough.

41:37.946 --> 41:39.479
It's not really our place

41:39.481 --> 41:41.614
to accept that apology,
though, is it?

41:41.616 --> 41:43.432
No, it's not.

41:43.434 --> 41:45.735
Nell?

41:45.737 --> 41:47.904
Your call.

41:55.412 --> 41:57.330
It's all good.

41:57.332 --> 41:59.549
Good.

42:06.807 --> 42:09.642
She's got the Gorgon stare.

42:09.644 --> 42:12.145
I want to come
down here more often.

42:12.147 --> 42:14.647
Nothing like
a good open-plan workspace.

42:14.649 --> 42:15.648
Exactly.

42:15.650 --> 42:17.350
Couldn't agree more.
Yeah, okay.

42:22.189 --> 42:24.223
Bring the box?
Yeah.

42:29.947 --> 42:31.948
Let's go.
No, I'm okay, actually.

42:31.950 --> 42:33.966
Stop.

42:41.041 --> 42:46.041
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==

42:51.547 --> 42:55.266
<i>All good, indeed.</i>
