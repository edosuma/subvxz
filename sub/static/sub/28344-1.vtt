01:21.083 --> 01:23.516
Let's meet our first
potential fooler.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.654
<i>- I'm Matt Marcy,

01:27.689 --> 01:29.255
<i>I always wanted my magic
to be more</i>

01:29.291 --> 01:31.958
<i>than just a series of tricks,</i>

01:31.993 --> 01:33.827
<i>and so I created a stage play.</i>

01:33.862 --> 01:35.762
Opening night,

01:35.797 --> 01:37.197
<i>I looked out in the audience,</i>

01:37.232 --> 01:38.598

01:44.539 --> 01:45.772
I wanted to go a step further,

01:45.807 --> 01:47.907
<i>and so I created a web series</i>

01:47.943 --> 01:48.942
<i>about a magician.</i>

01:48.977 --> 01:50.477
I'm a magician.

01:50.512 --> 01:52.378
- Oh, okay.

01:52.414 --> 01:54.647
What instrument?

01:54.683 --> 01:55.882
<i>- The purpose of the web series</i>

01:55.917 --> 01:59.219
<i>was to explore magicians

01:59.254 --> 02:01.754
<i>Magicians will be looking

02:01.790 --> 02:03.456
That's how Criss Angel made it.

02:03.492 --> 02:04.457
They'll be looking for love.

02:04.493 --> 02:06.092
- Okay, magic boy.

02:06.128 --> 02:07.694
<i>And they'll see that

02:07.729 --> 02:09.027
A magician is, first,
a person,

02:09.064 --> 02:10.029
and he wants all the things

02:10.065 --> 02:12.699
<i>that every person would want.</i>

[cheers and applause]

02:25.914 --> 02:27.647
- Thank you very much.

02:27.682 --> 02:29.549
You know, I'm normally
a comedy magician,

02:29.584 --> 02:30.717
but because this is "Fool Us,"

02:30.752 --> 02:31.718
tonight, I wanted to do

02:31.753 --> 02:33.186
something a little different.

02:33.221 --> 02:34.888
A giant, over-the-top,

02:34.923 --> 02:36.556
Las Vegas-style

02:36.591 --> 02:38.224
grand illusion.
What do you think?

02:38.260 --> 02:39.292
[cheers and applause]

02:39.327 --> 02:40.493
Okay.

02:40.529 --> 02:42.929
Uh, I've actually brought
four with me.

02:42.964 --> 02:44.164
I only have time for one.

02:44.199 --> 02:46.099
But I'm gonna let you choose
the one I do,

02:46.134 --> 02:47.100
and to make that choice fair,

02:47.135 --> 02:48.735
I made this simple poster.

02:48.770 --> 02:50.103
It says,

02:50.138 --> 02:52.305
"The trick that will fool
Penn and Teller will be..."

02:52.340 --> 02:53.740
A, B, C, or D.

02:53.775 --> 02:54.807
Penn, you get the choice.

02:54.843 --> 02:56.743
- Uh, C.
- C.

02:56.778 --> 02:57.810
Very good choice.
Very confident.

02:57.846 --> 02:59.345
Let's see what you didn't pick.

02:59.381 --> 03:00.513
You could've picked A,
and tonight,

03:00.549 --> 03:02.749
I'd be performing for you...

03:02.784 --> 03:05.451
The appearing
Empire State Building.

03:05.487 --> 03:06.819
Oh!

03:06.855 --> 03:08.688
The Empire State Building
vanishes from New York,

03:08.723 --> 03:10.456
appears right on this stage.

03:10.492 --> 03:12.458
It doesn't even fit,
but it's magic.

03:12.494 --> 03:13.459
[laughter]

03:13.495 --> 03:14.794
Not tonight.
Could've gone with B.

03:14.829 --> 03:16.062
That was, uh,
one of my favorites.

03:16.097 --> 03:18.431
That's the levitating shark.

03:18.466 --> 03:20.200
Ah, a 2,000-pound great white

03:20.235 --> 03:21.634
floats around,
eats three people.

03:21.670 --> 03:22.769
It's spectacular.

03:22.804 --> 03:24.137
[laughter]

03:24.172 --> 03:25.705
And D--I was hoping for D--

03:25.740 --> 03:27.073
D was the, uh--

03:27.108 --> 03:28.741
the deadly double bullet catch.

03:28.777 --> 03:29.943
Oh!

03:29.978 --> 03:31.578
Nobody figures that out.

03:31.613 --> 03:34.314
- [laughs]

03:34.349 --> 03:35.882
- But you picked C.
- I did.

03:35.917 --> 03:36.950
- That is why I was hoping
you would pick it.

03:36.985 --> 03:38.117
It's my favorite one on there,

03:38.153 --> 03:39.819
the most spectacular illusion
I know.

03:39.854 --> 03:40.987
Get ready, because tonight,

03:41.022 --> 03:43.189
I will be performing for you...

03:43.225 --> 03:44.624
a card trick!

03:44.659 --> 03:45.858
[laughter]

03:45.894 --> 03:48.061
Excellent choice, Penn.

03:48.096 --> 03:50.530
I love card tricks.
I brought a deck of cards.

03:50.565 --> 03:51.831
Jumbo deck,
so we can all see,

03:51.866 --> 03:53.733
and I should be honest.
I love card tricks,

03:53.768 --> 03:55.435
but card tricks
used to be simple, right?

03:55.470 --> 03:56.970
You pick a card,
the magician would find it.

03:57.005 --> 03:58.204
Very easy.

03:58.240 --> 04:00.073
Lately, I have seen
these complex card tricks

04:00.108 --> 04:01.608
I can't follow,
so tonight,

04:01.643 --> 04:03.142
I will do the opposite of that,

04:03.178 --> 04:04.477
and I will create for you

04:04.512 --> 04:06.479
the world's simplest card trick,

04:06.514 --> 04:08.715
and I have simplified it
the way anybody would:

04:08.750 --> 04:11.384
with a clear and concise
PowerPoint presentation.

04:11.419 --> 04:13.419
[laughter]

04:13.455 --> 04:15.154
So here it is,
ladies and gentlemen:

04:15.190 --> 04:17.690
The world's simplest
card trick.

04:17.726 --> 04:18.925
Now, I should begin
by explaining

04:18.959 --> 04:23.029
that of magic tricks,
cards make up 62%.

04:23.064 --> 04:24.163
It's actually--
it's actually a bit odd.

04:24.199 --> 04:25.265
You see
from this graph,

04:25.300 --> 04:26.432
as the number of card tricks
go up,

04:26.468 --> 04:28.234
the quality of the magician
goes down.

04:28.270 --> 04:30.003
[laughter]

04:30.038 --> 04:31.404
However,
according to this graph,

04:31.439 --> 04:32.905
as the number of graphs go up,

04:32.941 --> 04:35.375
the quality of the magician
goes up, so I'm in good shape.

04:35.410 --> 04:36.709
Here's a few more graphs
with that statistic,

04:36.745 --> 04:38.211
in case you missed it.

04:38.246 --> 04:40.179
Here it is in 3D.

04:40.215 --> 04:41.881
- [laughs]

04:41.916 --> 04:42.882
- Now, of those tricks--

04:42.917 --> 04:44.517
uh, 99% are bad card tricks.

04:44.552 --> 04:46.386
Really, only like 1% of card tricks

04:46.421 --> 04:48.321
are any good,
but this trick

04:48.356 --> 04:49.589
falls right about...

04:49.624 --> 04:51.357
there.
Right there, yes.

04:51.393 --> 04:53.493
Of those tricks, 79% are
the "pick a card,"

04:53.528 --> 04:54.827
or the PAC card tricks,

04:54.863 --> 04:57.697
18% are the "no card selected,"
the NCS tricks,

04:57.732 --> 04:59.666
and only 3%
are the most difficult kind,

04:59.701 --> 05:00.833
the "think of a card" tricks.

05:00.869 --> 05:01.968
That's what we'll do tonight.

05:02.003 --> 05:04.470
In a minute, somebody here
will TOAC,

05:04.506 --> 05:05.538
and, uh, Alyson,

05:05.573 --> 05:06.706
would you mind helping?

05:06.741 --> 05:07.740
- Sure.
- In a moment, I will ask you

05:07.776 --> 05:08.808
to TOAC.

05:08.843 --> 05:10.877
- Okay.
- Very good.

05:10.912 --> 05:12.111
Now, it would appear that Alyson

05:12.147 --> 05:14.847
has a free choice
of 52 different cards.

05:14.883 --> 05:16.149
- Mm.

05:16.184 --> 05:18.718
[laughter]

05:18.753 --> 05:19.986
- Actually, we did studies.
We found that women

05:20.021 --> 05:20.987
tend to choose red cards.

05:21.022 --> 05:22.355
Men tend to choose black cards.

05:22.390 --> 05:23.489
Kids, of course,
choose the joker.

05:23.525 --> 05:25.625
Please don't choose the joker.
No joker.

05:25.660 --> 05:26.726
Also, two very popular cards--

05:26.761 --> 05:27.860
I don't want to influence you.

05:27.896 --> 05:29.095
They can be chosen
if you would like.

05:29.130 --> 05:30.496
The queen of hearts
and the ace of spades.

05:30.532 --> 05:32.332
But they are
very common choices.

05:32.367 --> 05:33.900
Uh, a lot of women
choose the queen of hearts

05:33.935 --> 05:35.735
because it represents love,
and beauty,

05:35.770 --> 05:37.270
and, of course,
decapitation.

05:37.305 --> 05:38.338
Remember her?

05:38.373 --> 05:39.706
[laughter]

05:39.741 --> 05:41.207
Then we have the ace of spades
for the guys

05:41.242 --> 05:42.842
because it represents strength.

05:42.877 --> 05:44.510
It's known as the bullet card,

05:44.546 --> 05:46.412
which is weird,
because a spade is a shovel.

05:46.448 --> 05:48.614
It should be known
as the gardening card,

05:48.650 --> 05:50.249
but it's not.
It's known as the bullet card,

05:50.285 --> 05:52.185
not to be confused
with a bullet point.

05:52.220 --> 05:53.386
That looks like this.

05:53.421 --> 05:55.988
[laughter]

05:56.024 --> 05:57.090
So Alyson, for the first time,

05:57.125 --> 05:58.391
would you please TOAC?

05:58.426 --> 05:59.625
Think of a card.

05:59.661 --> 06:01.027
- Um...

06:01.062 --> 06:02.195
Nine of clubs.

06:02.230 --> 06:03.296
- The--the T, the "think"...
- Oh.

06:03.331 --> 06:04.997
- Was key for this to work.
Yeah.

06:05.033 --> 06:06.833
[laughter]

06:06.868 --> 06:07.967
- Sorry.
- So forget the nine.

06:08.002 --> 06:08.968
Think of a card.
- Yeah.

06:09.003 --> 06:09.969
- Got one?

06:10.004 --> 06:11.137
- Now I do.
- Very good.

06:11.172 --> 06:12.138
Now,

06:12.173 --> 06:13.172
change your mind, CYM,

06:13.208 --> 06:15.208
to another card, AOC.

06:15.243 --> 06:16.209
- Mm-kay.
- You got a new one?

06:16.244 --> 06:17.210
- Yeah.
- Good.

06:17.245 --> 06:18.511
Alyson, in your mind, IYM,

06:18.546 --> 06:20.046
turn your card face down, FD,

06:20.081 --> 06:21.180
and visualize
the back of the card,

06:21.216 --> 06:22.548
the BOTC.

06:22.584 --> 06:23.549
[laughter]

06:23.585 --> 06:24.717
- Okay.
- These are

06:24.753 --> 06:25.952
the rider back cards.
They're made by

06:25.987 --> 06:27.286
The United States
Playing Card Company.

06:27.322 --> 06:29.389
Of course, they were founded
in Cincinnati, Ohio.

06:29.424 --> 06:30.890
If you haven't been there,
here's a picture of Cincinnati,

06:30.925 --> 06:32.058
courtesy of Google Maps.

06:32.093 --> 06:34.627
- [laughs]

06:34.662 --> 06:37.663
[applause]

06:40.402 --> 06:41.801
- Let's review.

06:41.836 --> 06:43.503
[laughter]

06:43.538 --> 06:45.238
So far, I asked Alyson
to TOAC.

06:45.273 --> 06:46.539
Then she CYM'd to AOC,

06:46.574 --> 06:47.974
IYM, she turned the card FD,

06:48.009 --> 06:49.242
and visualized the BOTC,

06:49.277 --> 06:50.443
made by the USPCC

06:50.478 --> 06:51.911
from Cincinnati, OH.

06:51.946 --> 06:53.012
Okay?

06:53.047 --> 06:56.349
- Okay.

06:56.384 --> 06:57.817
- So Alyson,

06:57.852 --> 06:59.218
for the first time,
name the card

06:59.254 --> 07:00.219
you're thinking of.

07:00.255 --> 07:01.487
- Eight of clubs.

07:01.523 --> 07:03.022
- Eight of clubs.
- Mm-hm.

07:03.057 --> 07:05.057
And that's your card, the one
that IYM, you turned FD?

07:05.093 --> 07:06.626
- [laughs]
Sure.

07:06.661 --> 07:08.461
- Excellent, Alyson.
Well done.

07:08.496 --> 07:10.496
In this deck of cards,
there are 52 cards.

07:10.532 --> 07:12.398
They are all facing
in one direction.

07:12.434 --> 07:14.133
However, IYM,
in your mind,

07:14.169 --> 07:16.235
you turned a single card
FD, face down,

07:16.271 --> 07:18.237
so one card, somewhere
in there, should be reversed

07:18.273 --> 07:20.039
from all the rest,
and they can be tough to spot.

07:20.074 --> 07:22.708
If anyone sees it,
let me know.

07:22.744 --> 07:24.811
Oh, I see it.

07:24.846 --> 07:27.046
One card is turned over
in the deck.

07:27.081 --> 07:28.247
Now, Alyson,

07:28.283 --> 07:29.482
if that is the eight of clubs,

07:29.517 --> 07:30.483
would that be a good trick?

07:30.518 --> 07:32.084
- Yeah.
Definitely.

07:32.120 --> 07:33.319
- That'd be
a freaking miracle, Alyson.

07:33.354 --> 07:34.487
- I know.
- There's no floating shark.

07:34.522 --> 07:36.055
This is it, okay?
- Yeah.

07:36.090 --> 07:37.190
Yeah.

07:37.225 --> 07:38.991
- You had a free choice
of 52 cards.

07:39.027 --> 07:40.326
You randomly
picked the eight of clubs,

07:40.361 --> 07:42.595
and I told you,
this isn't just any card trick.

07:42.630 --> 07:44.197
This is the world's simplest

07:44.232 --> 07:45.364

07:45.400 --> 07:47.333
- Oh!

07:47.368 --> 07:50.236
Matt Marcy!

07:50.271 --> 07:51.771
That was awesome.

07:51.806 --> 07:52.772

07:52.807 --> 07:54.006
- Yeah.

07:54.042 --> 07:55.541
Wow.

07:55.577 --> 07:57.777
That must kill at conventions.

07:57.812 --> 07:59.378
- They love it.
Everyone loves it everywhere.

07:59.414 --> 08:00.847
We've all suffered
through PowerPoint.

08:00.882 --> 08:02.448
It doesn't just have
to be corporate stuff.

08:02.484 --> 08:04.016
Everyone has been through
these slide shows.

08:04.052 --> 08:06.552
- That's
the best PowerPoint ever.

08:06.588 --> 08:08.387
It's so entertaining.
- Thank you!

08:08.423 --> 08:09.856
- Right, and funny,

08:09.891 --> 08:11.123
and--yeah.
- And there's a card trick.

08:11.159 --> 08:13.626
- So--so how did you
come up with this idea?

08:13.661 --> 08:15.228
- Well, I like to wrap my magic

08:15.263 --> 08:16.963
in, like, presentations
that people can relate to

08:16.998 --> 08:18.431
and connect with,
and I always thought PowerPoint

08:18.466 --> 08:19.632
was one of those things.

08:19.667 --> 08:20.900
- Yeah.
- So it made sense for me

08:20.935 --> 08:23.269
to do that, and all of my stuff
is comedy magic,

08:23.304 --> 08:24.570
but it's all tied in
with story,

08:24.606 --> 08:26.105
so stories about my life,
stories about people I know,

08:26.140 --> 08:27.740
stories about things
I've experienced.

08:27.775 --> 08:28.841
Uh, I actually developed

08:28.877 --> 08:30.843
a stage show
and a web series

08:30.879 --> 08:32.477
about a magician
that's all story-based

08:32.514 --> 08:34.080
and mixes magic
and storytelling.

08:34.115 --> 08:35.615
That's always been sort of
what I'm most interested in.

08:35.650 --> 08:36.883
- That's cool.
All right,

08:36.918 --> 08:38.017
let's go to the boys.
- All right, let's see

08:38.052 --> 08:39.217
what they have to say.
- See if they've

08:39.254 --> 08:41.254
figured it out or not.

08:41.289 --> 08:43.022
- Oh, man.
You know, Teller saw

08:43.057 --> 08:45.491
your show in LA.
You have a one-man show in LA.

08:45.527 --> 08:47.994
And Teller saw this.
As soon as he saw you come out,

08:48.029 --> 08:49.262
he was thrilled.
- Oh.

08:49.297 --> 08:50.396
- He was already over the moon,

08:50.431 --> 08:52.498
and I--I hadn't
seen you before,

08:52.534 --> 08:53.900
and it's just killer.

08:53.935 --> 08:55.668
Just so great.
I mean, I--

08:55.703 --> 08:58.471
I could not be
more sick of TED talks.

08:58.506 --> 09:01.507
I believe that, uh, oration

09:01.543 --> 09:03.142
in the United States of America

09:03.177 --> 09:04.176
has been destroyed

09:04.212 --> 09:05.578
by PowerPoint.
- Uh-huh.

09:05.613 --> 09:07.346
- I think they're
the worst things in the world,

09:07.382 --> 09:09.949
and the moment when you brought
up the Google map

09:09.984 --> 09:12.051
of Cincinnati--
what--what a great,

09:12.086 --> 09:13.686
really funny things.
- Oh.

09:13.721 --> 09:16.622
- And the basic rule
with comedy magicians

09:16.658 --> 09:17.957
is they're never that funny,

09:17.992 --> 09:19.625
and the magic's
never that good,

09:19.661 --> 09:22.028
and, uh, you--
you disproved both of those.

09:22.063 --> 09:23.963
It was funny
all the way through.

09:23.998 --> 09:26.866
You didn't even need a trick.

09:26.901 --> 09:29.435
And you also, uh,

09:29.470 --> 09:31.504
you also proved something
that, uh--

09:31.539 --> 09:32.838
that we like to say
all the time,

09:32.874 --> 09:35.741
which it really is
the singer, not the song.

09:35.777 --> 09:37.510
Uh, you did just--
- Thank you.

09:37.545 --> 09:40.546
- Just a beautiful job,
and just tight and crisp

09:40.582 --> 09:42.982
and funny and brilliant
and wonderful,

09:43.017 --> 09:44.383

09:44.419 --> 09:46.252
to ID this

09:46.321 --> 09:47.453
with the UMD.

09:47.488 --> 09:50.456
- [laughs]

09:50.491 --> 09:52.091
- It's a variation of an ID.

09:52.126 --> 09:53.359
It's a UMD.

09:53.394 --> 09:54.860
- Fair enough.
- Was that--was that code?

09:54.896 --> 09:56.128
- I think they're on
to the sorcery.

09:56.164 --> 09:57.229

09:57.265 --> 09:58.464

24:34.576 --> 24:36.910
it's the hardest thing
on "Fool Us,"

24:36.945 --> 24:38.812

24:38.847 --> 24:40.880

24:40.916 --> 24:43.283

and the audience just loved it.

24:43.318 --> 24:45.151

24:45.187 --> 24:46.553
is what you brought new to it,

24:46.588 --> 24:48.054
what you made unique
about it,

24:48.090 --> 24:49.489
I mean, you've gone back

24:49.524 --> 24:52.225

ethereal suspension,

24:52.260 --> 24:54.060

24:54.096 --> 24:56.129

this cheesy,

and everybody hates,

25:01.203 --> 25:03.303

in there.

25:20.155 --> 25:21.588

I'm gonna say,

25:21.623 --> 25:24.157

that sleight of hand guys

25:24.192 --> 25:25.158

hiding something
under a natural action.

25:29.197 --> 25:30.530

25:30.565 --> 25:32.499

you're gonna do something,
to do it.

31:05.467 --> 31:07.133
and we've done
a version of that,

31:07.169 --> 31:10.203
but one thing that makes
this act so deceptive

31:10.239 --> 31:12.572
is the fact that you do
the same trick

31:12.608 --> 31:14.007
in different ways.

31:14.042 --> 31:16.509

a really important thing.

but different methods.

31:18.947 --> 31:20.680

31:20.716 --> 31:24.050
that you've got this casual,
uh, outfit

31:24.086 --> 31:25.151
that looks really natural

31:25.187 --> 31:26.786
and really modern
and really good,

31:26.822 --> 31:28.021
and, uh, you use it

31:28.056 --> 31:29.256
just like a dove magician

31:29.291 --> 31:31.324
would use a--a set of tails.

31:31.360 --> 31:33.894
It's really wonderful,
and, you know, in dancing,

31:33.929 --> 31:36.229

as an insult,

31:36.265 --> 31:38.431
that the dancer has, uh,
two left feet,

31:38.467 --> 31:40.233

as a real compliment,

31:40.269 --> 31:41.468
you had two right feet.

33:41.225 --> 33:42.424
- But first--
- What do you mean, first?

33:42.459 --> 33:44.893

- Right there.

33:46.330 --> 33:47.929
There's your inheritance.
- Oh, that box?

33:53.504 --> 33:55.570
- We're all gonna sing
the dragon song.

33:55.606 --> 33:58.240
- Oh, God,
I knew there'd be a catch.

33:58.275 --> 33:59.341

about it is,

33:59.376 --> 34:00.776
they all know the dragon song.

You all know
the dragon song, don't you?

Let's do it.
Come on over here.
