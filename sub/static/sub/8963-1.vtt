WEBVTT

00:30.930 --> 00:32.921
Quiet on the set. And we're rolling.

00:33.099 --> 00:34.657
Cody Maverick interview, take one.

00:35.135 --> 00:36.202
Why are you guys here
to interview me?

00:36.770 --> 00:38.897
It's what we do.
We're a reality film crew.

00:39.972 --> 00:41.633
Should l know some of the questions
before we start?

00:41.808 --> 00:44.276
-No. They're easy.
-Okay.

00:44.444 --> 00:47.004
-Can you stand on that box, please?
-Oh, yeah.

00:48.615 --> 00:51.083
Right there? What is that?

00:51.284 --> 00:53.252
-What is that?
-A sound thing. It's a microphone.

00:53.420 --> 00:54.682
What's up, man? l'm Cody.

00:54.854 --> 00:56.617
And you're what, 1 4, 1 5 years old?

00:56.790 --> 00:58.724
Seventeen years of age.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.883
And any other skills
besides surfing?

01:01.094 --> 01:03.028
Like what?
Like singing and dancing?

01:03.196 --> 01:04.185
Yeah. Yeah.

01:06.199 --> 01:07.894
No, not me, man. l just surf.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.558
-Loser.
-l just--

01:10.804 --> 01:12.203
Cut it out, Glen. Stop, man.

01:12.372 --> 01:13.862
We're here to make
a movie about Cody.

01:14.040 --> 01:15.769
-Does he have to be here?
-lt's gonna be great.

01:15.975 --> 01:17.806
Can l get in line now to not see it?

01:17.977 --> 01:19.035
We'll re-slate.

01:19.212 --> 01:22.079
Since we're talking about surfing,
give us your thoughts about surfing.

01:22.282 --> 01:23.613
Surfing. Surfing.

01:25.118 --> 01:28.019
-Where do l start?
-How about at the beginning?

01:28.254 --> 01:30.119
Okay, well--

01:30.824 --> 01:35.887
So as soon as there was the first wave,
right? There was the first surfer.

01:37.430 --> 01:41.457
All they needed was, like,
a piece of driftwood...

01:41.634 --> 01:45.229
...a block of ice or something like
that, and then they were off.

01:46.139 --> 01:49.074
And they were hooked, man.
They were hooked.

01:52.312 --> 01:56.544
Up till recent times, you had
your old dudes. Your hang-six cats.

01:56.716 --> 01:59.685
These old guys used to lay down
with these huge, humongous boards.

02:00.186 --> 02:03.155
These guys were the pioneers...

02:03.356 --> 02:06.416
...but nobody saw
what surfing could really be...

02:06.993 --> 02:09.223
...until Big Z did it.

02:09.395 --> 02:12.489
-Could you tell us who Big Z was?
-Who was Big Z?

02:12.665 --> 02:17.329
You're asking the right guy.
You got that far. Z is everything.

02:17.537 --> 02:19.232
Big Z is surfing.
I mean, he's--

02:19.405 --> 02:21.566
There may well as not have been
an ocean before Z.

02:21.741 --> 02:23.868
They invented the ocean for him.

02:25.945 --> 02:29.346
He lived so hard
because he wasn't afraid to live.

02:29.716 --> 02:31.581
He wasn't afraid to die.

02:43.029 --> 02:45.793
He came to Antarctica
when I was just a kid.

02:47.367 --> 02:50.495
Man, it was the biggest thing
that ever happened here.

02:52.205 --> 02:54.400
And suddenly there he was.

02:54.574 --> 03:00.035
Just floating over the water.
Hovering, you know, like weightless.

03:03.983 --> 03:06.451
He could've walked up to anyone...

03:07.320 --> 03:10.118
...and he walks right up to me.

03:11.491 --> 03:15.086
And he gives me this awesome,
one-of-a-kind Big Z necklace.

03:16.029 --> 03:19.760
And then he tells me,
''You know, kid, never give up.

03:19.933 --> 03:23.425
Find a way,
because that's what winners do. ''

03:26.606 --> 03:28.836
He was the greatest.

03:30.043 --> 03:33.410
Everyone looked up to him,
respected him, loved him.

03:34.514 --> 03:38.006
And one day, one day
I'm gonna be just like him.

03:51.196 --> 03:51.897
And I've been surfing
ever since I can remember.

03:51.897 --> 03:53.660
And I've been surfing
ever since I can remember.

03:54.499 --> 03:56.433
lt's hard to imagine my life
when l wasn't surfing.

03:57.936 --> 04:01.099
I want to get out of here,
and this is my ticket out.

04:01.273 --> 04:04.640
I'm really good, man.
I'm the best on the island.

04:04.809 --> 04:10.873
I know it sounds cocky for saying that,
but, I mean, I am, like the best.

04:18.156 --> 04:20.920
I was born and raised here
in Shiverpool.

04:22.894 --> 04:24.657
Lived here my whole life.

04:24.829 --> 04:28.458
That's where they sort the fish. It's
the dumbest thing I've ever heard of.

04:28.633 --> 04:33.502
But yeah, I worked there
just to pacify my mom a little bit.

04:34.239 --> 04:36.400
Good old Shiverpool.

04:37.742 --> 04:39.175
This place sucks, bro.

04:39.811 --> 04:43.907
l worked my way up from the sardine
pile, then to the mackerel pile...

04:44.082 --> 04:45.913
...and l ended up
on the gefilte fish pile.

04:46.084 --> 04:48.382
-All hard work.
-Not like some l could mention.

04:48.553 --> 04:50.748
Yes, this farkakte kid
with the thing on the water.

04:51.256 --> 04:52.314
My house?

04:52.490 --> 04:54.583
Over there. You see it
right there with the surfboards?

04:55.493 --> 04:58.860
Yeah, l just live here with me
and my brother, Glen, my mom.

04:59.965 --> 05:02.195
He was a little, teeny, small egg.

05:03.668 --> 05:05.101
He wasn't very impressive.

05:05.270 --> 05:07.261
Glen was the big egg,
Cody was the small egg.

05:08.006 --> 05:10.440
He can't help it.
That's just the way he is.

05:10.608 --> 05:11.700
l mean, he's out there...

05:13.044 --> 05:16.502
...in the water all day
shirking his responsibilities.

05:16.881 --> 05:20.339
You know, hatching these eggs
is a big responsibility.

05:20.552 --> 05:22.816
And my brother, Cody,
he just doesn't understand that.

05:23.021 --> 05:27.617
-He needs to step up and be a man.
-lt takes a real man to sit on an egg.

05:27.792 --> 05:30.761
-You know it.
-Quincy, come to Daddy.

05:30.929 --> 05:33.090
He wants to be different.
All the time with the different.

05:33.264 --> 05:34.629
Who's got the time in the day to--

05:34.799 --> 05:36.289
Only six months in a day.

05:36.468 --> 05:38.265
-Thanks for making it.
-Sorry. lt was too good to miss.

05:38.436 --> 05:40.904
-Thanks for making it.
-How was it out there?

05:41.072 --> 05:42.801
He's the big brother.
l'm the little brother.

05:43.208 --> 05:44.800
l'm not touching you.

05:44.976 --> 05:46.466
-Not gonna touch you.
-Do you see this?

05:46.644 --> 05:47.906
-Don't. Please?
-l'm not.

05:48.079 --> 05:49.444
He makes sure that l know that.

05:49.881 --> 05:53.373
I had to fight for everything.
Even Mom's tuna casserole.

06:00.592 --> 06:01.684
I'm lucky I survived.

06:01.860 --> 06:04.886
lt really wasn't that easy
for him growing up.

06:05.497 --> 06:07.124
Like l said before...

06:08.199 --> 06:10.394
...he never really knew his father.

06:13.304 --> 06:17.468
l'm not really the person to ask about it
because l was too young to remember.

06:17.642 --> 06:20.236
Look, l'm not the only kid
on the island...

06:20.412 --> 06:23.939
...whose dad was, you know, eaten.

06:24.649 --> 06:29.916
-Still, it had to be traumatic.
-No. Not for me, bro. Not for me.

06:31.356 --> 06:34.519
-What's your dream?
-To go away.

06:35.260 --> 06:38.696
-To go away. That's great.
-Do you guys want a drink?

06:38.863 --> 06:41.923
Got to run away
from responsibility and life.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.362
This is unique.

06:43.535 --> 06:45.730
-This is not the norm.
-''l have dreams.''

06:47.105 --> 06:49.938
-When is this not happening?
-Don't make that noise.

06:52.010 --> 06:54.103
-Cody!
-lt's really disrespectful.

06:55.146 --> 06:56.477
l would never do that.

06:58.550 --> 07:00.279
You just wouldn't make it
out of your mouth.

07:00.452 --> 07:02.113
That's the difference
between you and me.

07:02.320 --> 07:04.550
You know what?
l can't do this anymore.

07:04.722 --> 07:05.950
Mom. Look what you did.

07:06.124 --> 07:08.490
This is for me. This isn't for you.
Why is Glen still here?

07:08.660 --> 07:11.185
Oh, yeah, exactly. Mom!

07:11.362 --> 07:13.296
I don't understand why
everybody's so judgmental.

07:13.465 --> 07:15.660
I understand why Mom's judgmental.

07:15.834 --> 07:19.395
I think it's because she cares,
partially. It's also partially because...

07:19.571 --> 07:22.062
...everyone else is looking at her like,
''Hey, Cody's just a bum.

07:22.240 --> 07:24.640
Cody's this. Cody's that.
Cody's this. ''

07:25.310 --> 07:27.870
Cody's me, bro. Let me be me.

07:28.513 --> 07:30.208
When is that gonna start?

07:42.727 --> 07:45.560
You know what they call me?
The dream maker. The dream maker.

07:46.965 --> 07:48.933
l find these kids,
l bring them here...

07:49.100 --> 07:52.331
...and I give them a chance
to be somebody.

07:53.438 --> 07:56.305
You know my greatest joy
as a surf promoter? Finding Z.

07:56.474 --> 07:57.941
Watching him rise to the top.

07:58.109 --> 08:02.341
I still can't believe he's gone.
He was like a son to me, you know?

08:02.514 --> 08:06.280
lt was a heart thing, you know?
Can we just take five minutes?

08:06.518 --> 08:09.612
How's my hair? ls it messed up?
l ain't got all day. ls it mussed?

08:09.787 --> 08:11.482
We just have a few more questions
about Big Z.

08:11.656 --> 08:13.351
But right now
l think we're more interested...

08:13.525 --> 08:15.891
...in the Reggie Belafonte story,
and who could blame us?

08:16.060 --> 08:17.789
But Big Z is kind of the focus
of our--

08:17.962 --> 08:19.862
Let's get the coconut filler guy
over here.

08:20.031 --> 08:21.658
And how about the guy
sweeping the sand?

08:21.833 --> 08:25.633
Can we hear your boring story
about your tedious, ridiculous life?

08:25.803 --> 08:27.498
Get your feathers off it! Stop!

08:27.705 --> 08:29.639
l ain't got all day.
l got a big production here.

08:29.807 --> 08:30.967
Roll, okay? Just roll!

08:31.376 --> 08:35.369
Welcome, fans, to another edition
of SPEN Sports.

08:35.813 --> 08:37.178
This is Sal Masakela...

08:37.347 --> 08:41.682
...and we're here at the surfing capital
of the world, Pen Gu Island...

08:41.852 --> 08:46.153
...for a preview of the tenth annual
Big Z Memorial Surf-Off.

08:47.158 --> 08:49.217
Professional surfers
extraordinaire...

08:49.394 --> 08:51.259
...Kelly and Rob tell us...

08:51.429 --> 08:53.829
...what challenges
our surfers are going to face.

08:55.233 --> 08:57.758
First things first, Sal. The wave.
lt's the perfect combination...

08:57.936 --> 09:02.396
...of beauty and danger. Even
the pros are terrified of this place.

09:04.442 --> 09:05.602
Hi, Mom.

09:05.777 --> 09:07.301
Dig this, Sal. Section behind me.

09:08.646 --> 09:10.944
lt's ''The Boneyards.''
Few surfers have ventured in there...

09:11.115 --> 09:12.139
...and come out alive.

09:12.317 --> 09:14.911
Are you trying to tell me
people have died here?

09:15.086 --> 09:17.714
-That's right, Sal.
-A moment of silence for them.

09:17.889 --> 09:21.950
And we keep it moving because
if the Boneyards was not enough...

09:22.126 --> 09:26.028
...our surfers will be facing off with
Tank ''The Shredder'' Evans.

09:26.197 --> 09:29.030
Tank, nine-time defending champ.

09:29.834 --> 09:31.131
A role model? No.

09:32.637 --> 09:35.265
But l do consider myself somebody
that everyone should look up to.

09:35.440 --> 09:38.034
Kids should try to pretend
that they're Tank.

09:38.209 --> 09:40.677
l mean, they should try.
Good luck, kids.

09:41.613 --> 09:44.173
You never want to get in there
and help them out...

09:44.349 --> 09:48.080
...and show them how to surf
and spend some time with the kids?

09:48.253 --> 09:49.914
No, l don't want to do that.

09:50.088 --> 09:52.318
-Anyway, this is my wave.
-Always classy Tank Evans.

09:52.490 --> 09:55.220
Coming up after the break,
penguin dodge ball. Stick around.

09:56.661 --> 09:59.994
Okay, to get back to the competition,
l just want to say:

10:00.164 --> 10:03.099
l'm scouring the globe
for the next big thing.

10:03.434 --> 10:04.799
But that's another story.

10:09.340 --> 10:10.967
He doesn't look for them.
I find them.

10:12.343 --> 10:13.867
I find these penguins.
I find the talent.

10:15.213 --> 10:16.805
Reggie has sent me everywhere
on this trip.

10:17.048 --> 10:18.538
Anyplace there's an ocean...

10:19.884 --> 10:21.511
...a lake, a puddle.
It's ridiculous.

10:22.854 --> 10:25.652
I am on so much migraine medication,
you have no idea.

10:25.823 --> 10:28.986
The stress is killing me. l don't know
how much longer l can last.

10:29.160 --> 10:31.151
l have to tell you that right now.

10:34.065 --> 10:36.226
You gotta try
this blowhole thing, man.

10:36.401 --> 10:38.665
This whale dude
is giving me a brain freeze.

10:41.339 --> 10:42.806
l lost a bet.

10:43.207 --> 10:45.539
Excuse me. Excuse me.

10:45.710 --> 10:49.168
Does anybody
in this entire frozen wasteland surf?

10:49.347 --> 10:51.975
-The Cody Maverick kid does that.
-Wonderful. Thank you.

10:52.183 --> 10:54.151
You know, you're sitting on...
thin ice.

10:54.319 --> 10:57.447
Excuse me, l'm looking for--
l'm looking for Cody Maverick.

10:57.622 --> 11:01.251
-Has anyone seen Cody Maverick?
-l'm Cody Maverick.

11:02.694 --> 11:05.857
Mike Abromowitz from the Big Z
Memorial Surf-Off, Pen Gu lsland.

11:06.030 --> 11:07.861
You came here on a wha--
You came to see me. Wow!

11:08.032 --> 11:12.128
-Quite a slip-and-slider, aren't you?
-You're here. What an honor, sir.

11:12.303 --> 11:14.669
Lovely. Wonderful. l hear you surf.

11:14.839 --> 11:16.431
-ls this true?
-You gotta see what l can do.

11:16.607 --> 11:18.302
-You can actually stand on a board?
-l'll be back.

11:18.476 --> 11:20.671
You're gonna see what l can do
everything's gonna be good...

11:20.845 --> 11:23.336
-...and l'm coming with you.
-l can't imagine a better day.

11:23.514 --> 11:27.541
Ma! Ma, he came-- the scout.
Mikey. He came. He's here.

11:27.719 --> 11:30.381
-What? Yeah.
-He's giving me a shot now, Ma.

11:30.555 --> 11:32.113
You want to come watch me surf?

11:32.290 --> 11:34.224
-No, that's okay.
-Just this time.

11:34.392 --> 11:39.193
-l'm busy. l'm chopping here.
-Okay. All right, well, wish me luck.

11:39.364 --> 11:42.663
Cody, just be careful
of those big waves.

11:45.570 --> 11:47.629
Well, anytime now.

11:47.972 --> 11:52.102
You should have been here yesterday.
We had a sweet swell yesterday.

11:52.276 --> 11:55.245
l was doing some layback 360s
and floaters. lt was insane.

11:55.413 --> 11:56.744
Wow! Start the whale.

11:56.914 --> 11:58.848
No! Wait! Wait!
Just give me one more chance.

11:59.016 --> 12:00.677
-All l need is one, please.
-You just had it.

12:00.852 --> 12:02.786
-Dude, please don't go.
-Tough break, kid.

12:02.954 --> 12:05.320
-Just wait one second.
-Better luck next year. Move it.

12:05.490 --> 12:08.425
-Let's go. He's coming!
-Just one wave. That's all l need.

12:09.026 --> 12:12.518
I've never won anything
my whole life.

12:13.865 --> 12:16.299
Just once I want to feel like a winner.

12:16.768 --> 12:20.864
l used to scout songbirds. Toucans
for this musical revue in Brazil.

12:21.038 --> 12:23.302
Now that's show business.
Toucans--

12:23.474 --> 12:24.532
Hold on!

12:25.543 --> 12:28.307
l don't care what you say,
l'm coming to Pen Gu!

12:28.479 --> 12:33.314
No way, no how.
This is a contest for big-wave surfers.

12:33.484 --> 12:35.975
Can't this blubber ball go any faster?
Step on it, fish sticks!

12:37.889 --> 12:39.948
No, no, no, no!

12:44.896 --> 12:47.990
Poor kid. l feel bad a little bit.
Honestly, this is embar--

12:48.166 --> 12:49.633
No, wait! Wait!

13:01.446 --> 13:03.277
Did you guys see that?
He almost had my board!

13:04.248 --> 13:07.081
He almost had it.
Next time we'll get it.

13:07.251 --> 13:09.116
-Yeah, so anyway--
-Wait!

13:30.608 --> 13:33.873
We got you. We got you.
Oh, you are heavier than you look.

13:34.846 --> 13:36.108
-Man, we did it.
-Thank you.

13:36.280 --> 13:37.770
Teamwork always pays off.

13:37.949 --> 13:39.678
-l'm Chicken Joe, man.
-Thanks, Joe.

13:39.851 --> 13:43.218
Don't you ever, ever, do anything
like that in the contest, all right?

13:43.387 --> 13:44.649
-l'm in?
-Yeah, you're in.

13:44.822 --> 13:48.724
Because that was entertaining,
in a horrifying sort of way.

13:49.961 --> 13:51.451
Right on, dude.

13:52.663 --> 13:55.461
My name's Cody Maverick,
Shiverpool. You?

13:55.633 --> 13:57.965
No, l'm not from Shiverpool.

13:58.302 --> 14:01.897
-Where are you from?
-Dude, l'm from Lake Michigan.

14:02.073 --> 14:04.064
That's where I surf.
I was the only one...

14:05.543 --> 14:07.408
...around my town who did it.

14:07.612 --> 14:09.978
A lot of people thought
l was crazy, but l'm used to that.

14:10.147 --> 14:12.342
-l know how you feel, Joe.
-You do?

14:12.583 --> 14:15.211
-Yeah.
-Radical.

14:18.589 --> 14:21.990
-Butt freeze!
-Somebody help the chicken.

15:00.264 --> 15:01.856
Look out!

15:03.167 --> 15:05.135
Slater, Machado.
How's it going, bros?

15:05.303 --> 15:06.531
-Good. Thanks.
-What's up, buddy?

15:06.704 --> 15:08.433
Okay. Later, dudes.

15:09.373 --> 15:10.897
Radical.

15:31.862 --> 15:35.457
Dude, look where l'm standing.
l'm standing where Z stood.

15:37.234 --> 15:41.068
-Aw, man.
-Dude, you gotta try this.

15:41.238 --> 15:43.798
-No, l'm okay.
-Come on. Just one bite.

15:43.975 --> 15:46.307
All right. One bite, that's it.

15:47.678 --> 15:49.407
Yeah, yeah? What do you think?

15:49.580 --> 15:51.844
lt's not bad.
lt kind of tastes like chicken--

15:52.283 --> 15:54.183
Yep. What's chi-chi?

15:54.518 --> 15:57.578
Coming through! Oh, crap.

16:02.893 --> 16:05.361
Oh, man. l'm in love.

16:05.529 --> 16:08.589
Help me! l'm drowning!

16:11.836 --> 16:15.567
What are you standing here
next to me for? Go talk to her, man.

16:15.740 --> 16:17.765
-l'm not gonna talk to her.
-She's digging on you.

16:17.942 --> 16:19.034
-She called you crap.
-Joe.

16:19.210 --> 16:21.144
-Thanks again.
-All right, well...

16:21.312 --> 16:23.576
...this is the third time
you've been unconscious this week.

16:23.748 --> 16:25.579
l just don't think
it's very good for your brain.

16:25.750 --> 16:28.310
-l know. Bye, Lani.
-Okay.

16:28.919 --> 16:31.979
Yeah, that was awesome
how you saved his life and all.

16:32.156 --> 16:35.785
That was just unbelievable. Really.

16:37.662 --> 16:40.187
You here for the surf contest?

16:40.965 --> 16:45.163
-Well, l'll be watching you.
-Really? You'll be watching me?

16:45.336 --> 16:46.963
Well, yeah,
from the lifeguard station.

16:47.138 --> 16:49.436
-Yeah. Right.
-lt's my job.

16:49.607 --> 16:51.734
-That's your job.
-Are you gonna kiss her?

16:51.909 --> 16:53.934
-What's going on?
-Come on, Joe.

16:54.111 --> 16:56.375
-You were saying you were in love--
-No, l didn't say that.

16:56.547 --> 16:58.242
-Look, he really digs you.
-Joe, listen--

16:58.416 --> 17:00.577
He likes you, though. See you.

17:00.751 --> 17:02.844
l love my job.
l have an amazing job.

17:03.020 --> 17:04.385
Just this week, with the contest...

17:05.990 --> 17:09.391
...it's a little crazy. You really
have to be extra, extra attentive.

17:09.660 --> 17:12.753
When you have so many guys
in the water you can't miss a thing.

17:12.930 --> 17:16.593
But you know what? l have a perfect
record. l've never lost anybody.

17:16.800 --> 17:18.826
Sure, there have been
close calls, but--

17:19.002 --> 17:21.597
-Help!
-Oh, Arnold. l turn my back for one--

17:21.771 --> 17:24.104
-Just lay some feeling on her.
-How do you mean?

17:24.275 --> 17:27.642
-Through words. Through touch.
-Walk me through the approach.

17:27.811 --> 17:30.178
-l'm Lani. You're me.
-You sure about that?

17:30.347 --> 17:33.407
-l get real serious.
-Let's not. Let's not.

17:33.584 --> 17:35.074
-Whoa.
-What is it?

17:35.619 --> 17:38.213
That's it! That's Big Z's shrine.

17:38.389 --> 17:41.790
-Remember?
-No, no. Not really.

17:43.194 --> 17:47.062
Today, the world of surfing
lost one of its legends.

17:47.231 --> 17:49.859
Big Z took his final ride
this morning...

17:50.034 --> 17:54.528
...during a competition with
up-and-coming surfer Tank Evans.

17:55.106 --> 18:00.043
Z was last seen paddling into
a massive swell off Pen Gu Bay.

18:09.386 --> 18:13.789
Friends of Big Z gathered
to remember and celebrate his life.

18:16.160 --> 18:17.149
Great shot!

18:17.328 --> 18:18.795
What? Hey!

18:19.396 --> 18:22.229
-Every time.
-He's got a pretty good throwing fin.

18:22.399 --> 18:24.560
Stop doing-- Stop it! Cut it out!

18:25.336 --> 18:28.237
-That's like three in a row.
-Here, give it a shot.

18:30.574 --> 18:34.806
What? Wait a minute. Look at this.

18:34.979 --> 18:37.413
-Don't. Stop it.
-lt's a Big Z necklace.

18:37.581 --> 18:40.641
That's not funny. Stop.
Stop! What are you doing?

18:40.818 --> 18:42.945
Look, everybody, it's Big Z's last fan!

18:43.154 --> 18:45.019
Coming through.
Out of the way. Let's go.

18:45.189 --> 18:47.180
-You don't deserve to talk about him.
-He's a big zero.

18:47.358 --> 18:48.848
-Shut your mouth!
-Zero starts with ''Z''!

18:49.026 --> 18:51.859
You'll never be
as good as Big Z, Stank.

18:52.997 --> 18:56.558
Hey, hey, people, come on now.
Smile on your brother.

18:56.734 --> 19:01.068
-Keep your girlfriend out of this!
-You can't do that to my friend.

19:01.806 --> 19:04.741
You're getting quite a workout there.
That feels good.

19:04.909 --> 19:08.401
Why don't you work on my glutes
a little bit? That's very nice.

19:10.080 --> 19:14.107
-All right. That's enough, guys.
-l'll take you on anytime, anywhere.

19:14.285 --> 19:17.846
Well, then how about
right here, right now, huh?

19:18.022 --> 19:20.354
Hey, Mikey, get this kid a board!

19:20.524 --> 19:24.358
All right, who wants to see
the little guy take on the champ?

19:24.628 --> 19:26.186
Little guys rule!

19:26.363 --> 19:33.201
A little one-on-one surfing action
between Tank Evans and Jerry--

19:33.370 --> 19:35.133
-Cody. Cody.
-Cody Maverick.

19:35.472 --> 19:40.136
Cody Mavencourt. And the one
that rides the biggest wave wins.

19:52.022 --> 19:55.150
Are you nervous
about going against Tank Evans?

19:55.326 --> 19:57.760
Ah, Tank. Nervous?
What do l have to be nervous about?

20:17.214 --> 20:18.545
Give it up! Come on, now!

20:18.716 --> 20:20.547
l'm gonna chum the water
with your head.

20:20.718 --> 20:23.983
-Bring it on, pecker face. Let's go.
-Pecker face?

20:28.259 --> 20:29.590
lt's mine!

20:39.670 --> 20:41.604
So, Cody, when you take
your first wave...

20:41.772 --> 20:44.240
...and the whole island's there
to watch, what'll it be like?

20:44.408 --> 20:47.241
It's gonna be amazing.
It'll be the best wave of my life.

20:47.411 --> 20:49.811
l hope the cameras are rolling
because you'll want to watch it...

20:49.980 --> 20:53.507
...over and over and over again.
lt's gonna be awesome!

21:08.565 --> 21:09.964
l can't look.

21:10.467 --> 21:14.062
-Poor kid. He's-- Poor kid.
-Wow! That was spectacular!

21:17.274 --> 21:19.834
l'm number one! The Tank!

21:54.278 --> 21:57.736
We're trying to get the details.
The lifeguard just pulled him in.

22:01.251 --> 22:04.709
That's what happens
when you take on the Tank, right?

22:06.523 --> 22:07.717
Cody, Cody!

22:07.891 --> 22:10.553
-How is he? Okay? What can l do?
-Yeah, he's okay.

22:10.728 --> 22:15.722
l can help. Except if there's blood.
Just the thought of blood makes me....

22:16.533 --> 22:18.558
Somebody help the chicken.

22:18.736 --> 22:21.227
-Tank, you okay?
-Tank needs fuel.

22:21.739 --> 22:23.934
Mikey, get the board, will you?

22:24.441 --> 22:26.568
Come on. Come on. Come on.

22:30.914 --> 22:36.045
-Did l win? l won, huh?
-You should've stayed in Antarctica.

22:37.054 --> 22:39.113
-Oh, wow.
-You're gonna be okay.

22:39.289 --> 22:43.487
Look at that.
There's pixies everywhere.

22:44.962 --> 22:48.454
What do you think about Cody going
into a contest and possibly winning?

22:48.632 --> 22:49.656
-You know, l'm--
-Ha.

22:49.833 --> 22:53.599
-Why did you just laugh?
-Because he keeps saying ''possible.''

22:53.771 --> 22:58.208
Like it's ''possible'' that you're gonna
win. And you're gonna do anything.

22:58.375 --> 23:01.742
-Really, what are the chances?
-They're high. Aren't they high?

23:02.046 --> 23:06.107
l mean, they're normal chances.
lt's not like l'm, like, the underdog.

23:16.727 --> 23:21.460
Hey, Geek! Geek!
Get up and help me.

23:21.765 --> 23:23.232
Geek.

23:24.001 --> 23:25.559
Geek?

23:27.438 --> 23:31.636
Geek. Wake up! l need your help.

23:32.142 --> 23:34.440
Come on. Get off your lazy butt
and come and help me.

23:34.611 --> 23:36.272
--beautiful dream.

23:36.447 --> 23:39.746
-Did you ever know Sheila?
-No. l don't know Sheila.

23:39.917 --> 23:41.885
-Wait, wait, wait. What?
-What?

23:42.052 --> 23:43.041
Who's this guy?

23:43.220 --> 23:45.950
-He's a surfer. He's hurt.
-Who are all those guys?

23:46.123 --> 23:48.250
They're with him. lgnore them.

23:48.425 --> 23:50.154
-Come on.
-Lani, what are you doing?

23:50.327 --> 23:52.488
lf you help him, they'll go away.

23:52.663 --> 23:55.188
-Hey! Get out of here!
-Help him!

23:55.999 --> 23:58.695
-Where do you want him?
-Nowhere. That's the whole point.

23:58.869 --> 24:01.895
-No outsiders. Come on.
-l know, l know, l know.

24:02.072 --> 24:06.406
This is an emergency. He went down
bad over the falls. l don't know if he--

24:09.713 --> 24:11.578
-And did he hit the reef?
-l don't know.

24:11.748 --> 24:13.238
l'm not sure. l got him after--

24:13.417 --> 24:15.214
-What, is he your boyfriend?
-No. No.

24:15.385 --> 24:18.946
Wait, wait, wait.
Looks like he stepped on a fire urchin.

24:19.790 --> 24:23.282
Stepped on me? Are you kidding?
This guy was dancing on me.

24:24.628 --> 24:28.428
Just look at this. Broken, broken,
gone, gone, broken, broken, broken....

24:28.599 --> 24:33.434
This is pretty bad.
This is really bad.

24:34.505 --> 24:36.302
-What-- Cody!
-l hurt.

24:36.473 --> 24:39.874
-You're gonna be okay. What?
-Maybe l shouldn't have taken that out.

24:40.043 --> 24:41.943
Poison's released. Wow. Amazing.

24:42.112 --> 24:44.546
-What's amazing?
-That you're still alive.

24:44.715 --> 24:48.913
lt's all right. l'm gonna fix you up.
l can fix your foot just fine.

24:49.153 --> 24:52.850
-Where is it? l've been looking--
-lt's a saw. You just threw a saw.

24:53.023 --> 24:57.790
Don't let him move like that. He's
pushing the poison all over his body.

24:57.961 --> 25:00.191
-Come on, come on.
-l know he looks--

25:00.831 --> 25:02.298
Here it is.

25:03.367 --> 25:05.358
-What are you doing?
-What is he doing?

25:05.536 --> 25:06.833
This is a sure-fire cure.

25:07.004 --> 25:10.963
l learned it from an old medicine
man. lt, well, works wonders.

25:11.175 --> 25:13.234
-What? No! Not that!
-Not what?

25:13.443 --> 25:15.638
What is he gonna-- Gonna what?

25:16.280 --> 25:17.747
-Come on, now.
-Geek, stop.

25:17.915 --> 25:21.351
Let's do this. Lani, can you make
some water sounds?

25:21.518 --> 25:23.816
-Oh, my gosh, this is so gross.
-What is water sounds?

25:23.987 --> 25:27.718
-Come on. Here we go.
-No, no, no. You--

25:31.695 --> 25:34.755
Kid, you better keep your mouth shut.
See, what'd l tell you?

25:34.932 --> 25:37.992
Hold his foot still, Lani. Come on.
Knock him out or something.

25:38.168 --> 25:40.329
-l'm running on empty here.
-l'm trying!

25:45.242 --> 25:48.075
So how you been?

25:49.112 --> 25:51.580
Wow, sea urchin in the foot.
That sounds pretty nasty.

25:51.748 --> 25:52.737
Yeah.

25:52.916 --> 25:54.611
How do you cure something like that?

25:55.852 --> 25:57.183
You pee on it.

25:57.988 --> 26:00.456
-That's disgusting.
-l know!

26:00.624 --> 26:04.025
Hey. How long am l stuck
with this guy?

26:04.194 --> 26:06.059
-Because you know--
-Till he's better.

26:06.230 --> 26:10.826
Well, come back soon and,
please, bring me some clams.

26:11.001 --> 26:12.525
-No.
-l'm running low here.

26:12.703 --> 26:15.365
l can't keep doing this. You've got
to start taking care of yourself.

26:15.539 --> 26:17.200
-Oh, come on.
-Bye.

26:17.674 --> 26:22.168
-Bring me some more clams!
-Okay.

26:32.055 --> 26:34.751
lf it's just as well with you,
l don't want to talk about Cody.

26:34.925 --> 26:37.018
He lost. That's it.
That's his problem. lt's not mine.

26:37.194 --> 26:39.059
Aren't you concerned
about anybody's well-being--?

26:39.229 --> 26:41.993
The kid's fine. He was born in water.
He's a penguin, for crying out loud!

26:42.165 --> 26:44.929
-Did you see that wave hit him?
-That's the whole idea of surfing.

26:45.102 --> 26:48.230
-l care. l care!
-Mikey! Wait till you see this.

26:49.172 --> 26:51.231
Look at those little legs.
Stick, stick, stick, sticky.

26:51.408 --> 26:53.876
lt's the way l walk. l'm constantly--

26:54.044 --> 26:57.013
-Boom-chicka-chicka--
-What's with the ''boom-chicka-boom''?

26:57.648 --> 27:01.448
l can't stand blood.
l can't stand the sight of blood.

27:01.618 --> 27:05.452
l can't stand...
sight of blood. Cody!

27:06.657 --> 27:11.185
-Dude, have you seen my friend Cody?
-No.

27:11.728 --> 27:14.561
Cody? Cody?

27:17.100 --> 27:18.328
He's not under there.

27:18.835 --> 27:21.633
Cody!

27:23.473 --> 27:24.804
How's it going, man?

27:28.345 --> 27:29.812
So l woke up this morning.

27:29.980 --> 27:34.383
l didn't know where l was. lt's never
a good place to be when you wake up.

27:34.551 --> 27:36.746
Come on. Get up.

27:36.920 --> 27:38.615
-l don't want to.
-Breakfast.

27:38.789 --> 27:42.225
-Wakey, wakey. Come on.
-l don't want to.

27:43.460 --> 27:44.859
-How's your foot?
-My foot--

27:45.028 --> 27:49.124
-My foot's fine, but my head.
-Good. Good. Come on, kid. Get up.

27:49.866 --> 27:51.595
What the--?

27:53.003 --> 27:55.130
Yeah, l think l got a concussion.

27:58.675 --> 28:01.906
You should meet my brother, Glen.
You guys would really hit it off.

28:02.079 --> 28:07.574
Oh, no. No. Where's my necklace?
Did you see my necklace? lt's gotta--

28:08.385 --> 28:09.750
No, no.

28:09.920 --> 28:13.048
Big deal. Get yourself another one
at Reggie's trinket shops.

28:13.256 --> 28:16.453
lt's not just some necklace, guy.
He gave it to me himself.

28:16.626 --> 28:19.891
-Who?
-Big Z. When he came to Shiverpool.

28:20.063 --> 28:22.497
That guy believed in me
when no one else did.

28:22.666 --> 28:24.634
He told me never to give up
and to find a way...

28:24.801 --> 28:27.269
-...because that's what winners do.
-What winners do. Yeah.

28:27.437 --> 28:29.997
lt's funny, you know,
what a loser l became.

28:30.173 --> 28:34.473
Who cares what Big Z said?
You got to...

28:35.612 --> 28:40.276
-...you know, do things your own way.
-l don't have a way.

28:42.152 --> 28:47.784
You do now. Just follow this.
lt'll take you back to North Beach.

28:48.291 --> 28:51.158
Okay, nice to meet you.
Good luck.

29:00.036 --> 29:01.128
What do l do now?

29:01.304 --> 29:04.796
l can't show my face on the beach.
l can't go home.

29:07.244 --> 29:11.237
You always visualize where you're
gonna be, what you're gonna do.

29:14.951 --> 29:16.748
This ain't it.

29:45.348 --> 29:48.283
-What are you doing here?
-Here.

29:48.452 --> 29:52.354
-Oh, man. Thank you, man. This--
-Yeah.

29:52.522 --> 29:54.114
That's cool of you to come back.

29:54.291 --> 29:56.316
-Thank you.
-Better keep that knot tight.

29:56.493 --> 29:58.654
You lose it during a contest,
it's a goner.

29:58.829 --> 30:02.424
Yeah, well, l'm not going
in any surf contests.

30:03.033 --> 30:08.528
Well, there's more to surfing
than beating Tank Evans, you know.

30:09.940 --> 30:11.237
Yeah.

30:11.441 --> 30:14.342
Look at that.
You know what you're sitting on there?

30:15.045 --> 30:16.808
That's koa wood.

30:16.980 --> 30:19.107
Best surfboards in the world
are made of that stuff.

30:19.282 --> 30:22.308
-Yeah?
-You got a koa board?

30:22.486 --> 30:28.254
-No, l don't have a ''board'' board.
-Well, you wanna...?

30:28.992 --> 30:30.516
You want to make one?

30:31.661 --> 30:33.185
-Nah.
-What?

30:33.363 --> 30:35.661
l come all the way back here
to give you the necklace...

30:35.832 --> 30:39.324
...and l'm offering to make you
a board and you say, ''Nah.''

30:39.503 --> 30:42.233
Get off your lazy butt.
We're making a board. Come on.

30:42.405 --> 30:44.270
-All right.
-lt's gonna be the best board...

30:44.441 --> 30:45.465
...you ever had.

30:45.642 --> 30:47.200
-All right?
-Okay, man.

30:47.377 --> 30:48.435
Cody!

30:51.147 --> 30:52.239
That's cool.

30:52.582 --> 30:55.449
Joe, can you just tell us
why you're out here looking for Cody?

30:55.619 --> 30:57.985
You know, we've known
each other way back...

30:58.154 --> 31:03.023
...since, like, yesterday, l think it was.
We got a lot in common.

31:03.293 --> 31:05.352
I never really knew my father either.

31:11.668 --> 31:14.660
Why are you making surfboards
in the middle of the jungle anyway?

31:14.838 --> 31:17.329
l'm just trying to understand.
l don't get it.

31:17.507 --> 31:21.034
Forget the 20 questions.
Let's just get the board made.

31:21.444 --> 31:26.245
Okay, it's just--
Are you a surfer, or do you--?

31:28.852 --> 31:31.878
-Very funny.
-Less talk, more pushing. Come on.

31:32.489 --> 31:34.855
Why are we pushing it?
Why don't we just roll it?

31:35.692 --> 31:36.818
l'm sorry. l didn't mean--

31:36.993 --> 31:40.724
l didn't know your foot was there.
Are you okay? l'm sorry. l'm sorry.

31:40.897 --> 31:43.923
lt's not like l intentionally did it.
l'm sorry.

31:45.969 --> 31:48.199
-Cody. The log!
-Yeah, l know!

31:49.839 --> 31:52.433
Geek! Stop, stop!

31:53.910 --> 31:57.641
Cody, grab the vine. Grab the vine!

31:59.282 --> 32:01.512
-Now, pull it.
-l'm trying!

32:01.685 --> 32:03.482
Pull!

32:08.124 --> 32:09.489
Cody!

32:10.760 --> 32:12.091
Geek!

32:12.796 --> 32:14.058
Cody!

32:20.470 --> 32:23.371
Oh, no, no, no.

32:25.842 --> 32:28.572
Help me up so l can kick your butt.

32:29.913 --> 32:34.316
-l thought l killed you. You okay?
-Next time, when l say don't roll the--

32:34.484 --> 32:36.611
Wait. What's that?

32:39.322 --> 32:43.281
Yeah, it's a beach.
Sand, water, sun.

32:43.493 --> 32:46.121
You seen one, you seen them all.
Let's get out of here.

32:46.296 --> 32:48.560
No, come on, man.
Let's go check it out.

32:53.803 --> 32:55.862
You think Cody and the Geek
are doing all right?

32:56.039 --> 32:58.769
Yeah. l hate to see him
living out there all alone.

32:58.942 --> 33:00.807
lt'll be good for him
to have something to do.

33:13.490 --> 33:16.391
Hey. Somebody's old board shack.

33:24.034 --> 33:25.262
Look at this.

33:29.139 --> 33:31.073
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:31.941 --> 33:34.171
These are Big Z's boards.

33:34.344 --> 33:38.508
Yeah, these are Big Z's boards.
He rode this in the Australian Open.

33:39.916 --> 33:42.885
This is the board he rode
when he came to Shiverpool, man.

33:43.053 --> 33:45.817
This-- l-- Geek!

33:45.989 --> 33:48.583
This is Big Z's place, man!
This is where he lived!

33:48.758 --> 33:50.453
This is where he made his boards!

33:50.627 --> 33:51.992
Did you know this was here?

33:52.629 --> 33:54.256
Why didn't you wanna
come down here?

33:54.431 --> 33:58.527
And then he went up to this
old shack, you know.

34:12.449 --> 34:15.940
And I realized, you know...

34:16.953 --> 34:18.853
...it was Z.

34:42.112 --> 34:45.603
l could tell he needed some space
and some time to himself.

34:45.915 --> 34:47.780
l didn't want to ask him
all these questions.

34:47.951 --> 34:50.715
So l just kind of stood there quietly.

34:50.887 --> 34:53.355
You're Big Z! l can't believe it.

34:53.523 --> 34:55.286
You're alive! You're alive!

34:55.458 --> 34:57.255
That's the respectful way to go,
l think.

34:57.560 --> 34:58.857
Why are you alive?
What happened?

34:59.028 --> 35:01.292
Tell me everything.
Start at the beginning and just go.

35:01.564 --> 35:04.226
Kid! You're gonna
hurt yourself. Relax.

35:04.400 --> 35:08.166
And people said you were dead,
but you're not dead. You're in hiding.

35:08.505 --> 35:10.132
Did something happen?
Something happened.

35:10.306 --> 35:12.604
You saw something
you weren't supposed to see.

35:12.776 --> 35:14.004
l knew it!
That's what happened!

35:14.177 --> 35:17.010
Are you nuts?
lt's not a conspiracy. lt's no big deal.

35:17.180 --> 35:20.809
-What happened?
-l don't want to talk about it.

35:23.553 --> 35:25.043
You don't-- Okay, l got it!

35:25.221 --> 35:29.851
l'll be over here if you need anything
or you just feel like talking.

35:30.260 --> 35:32.592
Do you feel it now? Like talking now?

35:32.762 --> 35:35.492
-Go away.
-Got it. All right. l'm going away.

35:35.665 --> 35:36.893
Unless you--

35:37.100 --> 35:38.567
-Cody!
-Okay, got it.

35:38.735 --> 35:42.034
l'm not gonna lie to you.
This is, like, it's huge, man.

35:42.205 --> 35:45.572
lt changes everything.
The contest is a few days away.

35:45.742 --> 35:50.839
lf l can get him to train me, then--
Boom. l could win this with him.

35:51.314 --> 35:54.772
lt's my dream. And l don't want to
give up on that dream.

35:54.951 --> 35:57.886
Winners find a way,
no matter what, right?

35:59.823 --> 36:01.950
A winner is....

36:04.327 --> 36:06.420
They see their goals.
They just go for it.

36:06.596 --> 36:08.689
They're not in it
for the money or glory.

36:08.865 --> 36:12.198
-A winner is...like....
-Hey, hey!

36:13.002 --> 36:15.232
lt's the surfer who's out there
having the most fun.

36:15.405 --> 36:16.736
Yep, it's a lot of fun.

36:17.740 --> 36:20.265
Right, l get you. What's winning
without the losers?

36:20.443 --> 36:22.911
They're in it for the joy of it
and the rapture...

36:23.079 --> 36:25.070
...and the slow-motion
instant replay, which is my--

36:25.248 --> 36:28.081
Head over to the snack bar
and get yourself a big bowl of shut up!

36:28.251 --> 36:31.015
Feels better when there's a lot
of losers around.

36:31.187 --> 36:32.677
Was that your question?

36:32.856 --> 36:37.190
A winner is somebody who doesn't
knock me off my surfboard...

36:37.527 --> 36:40.394
...and break it when l'm trying
to get some big waves.

36:40.563 --> 36:43.361
Especially Tank.
He is definitely not a winner.

36:43.533 --> 36:46.366
He's a dirty trashcan full of poop.

36:46.970 --> 36:49.530
Yeah, l can't remember a time
when l wasn't surfing.

36:49.939 --> 36:52.635
My mom put me right on there.
l think she pooped me out...

36:52.809 --> 36:54.106
...just put me right on there.

36:54.277 --> 36:55.972
What is it about surfing
that you love?

36:56.246 --> 36:58.407
l love being the center of attention...

36:58.581 --> 37:01.311
...because it's really
where l should be.

37:01.784 --> 37:06.084
And l love the looks
my ladies give me, you know?

37:06.289 --> 37:10.282
The little glint. l love that.
l love holding the ladies.

37:10.860 --> 37:13.488
-You know what l'm talking about?
-I think so.

37:13.663 --> 37:16.063
-Sort of.
-Come with me.

37:19.235 --> 37:21.135
Put this curtain in myself.

37:23.306 --> 37:25.103
These are my ladies.

37:26.476 --> 37:28.910
This is Jill.
This is my lady, Amy.

37:29.078 --> 37:31.410
Little Suzie. Briana.

37:31.581 --> 37:34.516
-You know why we call her Briana?
-No.

37:34.684 --> 37:36.117
lt's a long story.

37:36.286 --> 37:39.084
Shaniqua. Helga. Miss Kitty.

37:39.255 --> 37:41.416
Jeannie. l dream of....

37:41.824 --> 37:45.453
Theresa.
This is Theresa right here.

37:46.129 --> 37:49.462
-Now, is Theresa, is that your--
-Dirty girl.

37:50.066 --> 37:54.969
This spot?
This spot is for my special lady, Lia.

37:55.805 --> 38:00.037
l'm gonna say that one more time.
Lia. Oh, yeah.

38:00.743 --> 38:02.267
That's a sweet, sweet lady.

38:02.478 --> 38:05.140
Tank! Are you polishing
your trophies again?

38:06.616 --> 38:10.950
Mom, l wasn't polishing.
l was talking to my friends.

38:12.555 --> 38:14.318
l'm gonna be polishing later.

38:15.325 --> 38:17.987
When's he coming out?
I'm running out of film.

38:18.828 --> 38:21.456
Mr. Topanga! Could you
tell us why you're not dead?

38:21.631 --> 38:24.930
No! l am dead! l'm dead.

38:30.506 --> 38:32.337
What are you doing?

38:33.910 --> 38:35.741
Hey, who said you--

38:35.912 --> 38:38.574
Turn the board around.
Get back here.

38:38.748 --> 38:40.807
Come out here
and show me some moves.

38:41.017 --> 38:42.348
-No, no.
-Come on!

38:42.518 --> 38:46.181
-Grab a board and come out.
-You want to kill yourself, go ahead.

38:46.356 --> 38:48.654
Fine with me.
Just don't mess up my board.

38:48.825 --> 38:52.591
-How do you turn this thing?
-lt's not a short board. Sit back on it.

38:52.762 --> 38:54.252
Hey, watch the wave!

38:56.599 --> 38:59.898
You mess up my board,
l'm messing up your other foot.

39:00.069 --> 39:04.301
l'm just trying to ride
this canoe or whatever it is, okay?

39:04.474 --> 39:08.001
Stop trying so hard! Just relax.

39:08.344 --> 39:10.539
What do you mean, rela--?

39:12.548 --> 39:15.346
Long, smooth strokes.

39:15.518 --> 39:18.487
-Dig deep. Dig, come on.
-l'm digging!

39:18.654 --> 39:22.181
Keep the nose up! Keep it up!
Watch it! You're pearling!

39:28.531 --> 39:31.728
-What are you doing?
-Come on, please?

39:31.901 --> 39:34.369
Z, l can't learn anything
with you on the beach.

39:34.537 --> 39:37.404
Well, then you're not gonna
learn anything.

39:37.573 --> 39:40.736
-Now, come on in.
-l'm not coming in until you come out.

39:40.910 --> 39:44.710
Oh, you're coming in, all right.
He's not even watching the wave.

39:45.014 --> 39:47.175
-What wave?
-That one.

39:47.350 --> 39:51.650
Five, four, three, two, and....

40:03.933 --> 40:06.697
-Don't touch my stuff, man.
-l couldn't help it.

40:06.869 --> 40:11.033
-l just wanted to learn from the best.
-Yeah, well.

40:11.207 --> 40:13.801
-l don't surf anymore, okay?
-What?

40:13.976 --> 40:15.603
What do you mean, you don't surf?

40:15.778 --> 40:18.110
You want to learn
how to surf the right way?

40:18.281 --> 40:19.714
Sure.

40:19.882 --> 40:22.715
Then you gotta make
your own board, all right?

40:23.786 --> 40:26.550
-What do you mean, you don't sur--
-Can't hear you.

40:26.722 --> 40:28.553
-Can l ask one question--
-We're making a board.

40:28.724 --> 40:31.215
Could you tell me
about your board?

40:31.394 --> 40:35.023
l just have a palm tree board.

40:35.465 --> 40:38.298
l would have to say it's not
the nicest board in the world...

40:38.468 --> 40:40.402
...but it is a pretty good board.

40:40.570 --> 40:43.368
The ancient Hawaiians believe
that ''mana'' or heart...

40:43.539 --> 40:46.337
...was transferred into the surfboard
as you shaped it.

40:46.509 --> 40:48.636
What are your thoughts on that?

40:48.811 --> 40:52.110
What's up with the hair?
You could fit a whole fish in there.

40:52.281 --> 40:54.806
My dream surfboard.
lt's pretty powerful.

40:54.984 --> 40:58.317
You can add a lot of attachments to it,
like a grenade launcher attachment.

40:58.488 --> 40:59.785
Anybody know whose board this is?

40:59.956 --> 41:02.823
-l'm pretty sure it's the chicken's.
-Has anybody seen the chicken?

41:02.992 --> 41:05.051
Cody!

41:05.361 --> 41:09.092
l know he's out here.
l can feel it in my nuggets.

41:09.265 --> 41:12.701
Aren't you nervous out here
in the jungle? It's kind of dangerous.

41:12.869 --> 41:16.464
Dude, the jungle is the most
peaceful place on the planet.

41:22.345 --> 41:25.542
-Hold it steady.
-This is a dream come true.

41:25.715 --> 41:28.843
This is a dream come true,
to be here with Z, doing this.

41:29.018 --> 41:31.009
-And it's koa wood.
-Where's the--

41:31.187 --> 41:33.155
All the best boards
are made from koa wood.

41:33.689 --> 41:38.353
All right, now,
l drew this pattern as a guide.

41:38.528 --> 41:43.261
Do you want to have your board
with a lot of rocker or just a little?

41:44.000 --> 41:45.331
l don't know.

41:45.501 --> 41:48.527
What you want is something
in-between. Trust me.

41:48.704 --> 41:50.296
-l'm the expert here.
-Okay.

41:50.907 --> 41:52.169
So...

41:52.542 --> 41:54.669
...here are your shaping tools.

41:55.111 --> 41:59.912
Now, remember, the board's
already inside there, see, somewhere.

42:00.082 --> 42:03.415
And what you're doing
is you're trying to find it.

42:03.586 --> 42:06.248
-Reveal it. All right?
-Okay.

42:06.689 --> 42:10.125
Every carve counts.
Why are you smiling? Don't smile.

42:10.293 --> 42:14.286
-l'm not smiling. l'm excited.
-This isn't like hacking a piece of ice.

42:14.463 --> 42:15.963
lt takes patience and finesse.

42:16.934 --> 42:21.099
All right already. Can you just give me the tools, please?

42:21.270 --> 42:23.830
-Here, take it. Go ahead. -Thank you.

42:24.774 --> 42:27.766
-Here we go. -What are you doing?

42:29.112 --> 42:31.171
lf you're gonna do it, do it right.

42:31.347 --> 42:34.510
All right, look. First of all, with the grain.

42:34.751 --> 42:37.777
With the grain. You see what l'm doing here?

42:38.021 --> 42:41.787
You let the tool do the work. You see?

42:41.958 --> 42:44.791
Just like you're riding a wave. You let the wave do the work.

42:44.961 --> 42:49.159
You don't fight the wave. You can't fight these big waves.

42:49.332 --> 42:53.598
Long strokes. Loads of finesse.

42:54.570 --> 42:57.698
Find the board within the tree.

42:57.874 --> 43:00.968
-Nice and easy. -Yeah, l got it.

43:01.144 --> 43:03.305
See that? You just....

43:03.813 --> 43:05.804
-You just.... -Maybe l could do it now.

43:05.982 --> 43:07.574
Move with...

43:08.584 --> 43:11.144
-With the.... -Can l do it now?

43:12.955 --> 43:14.513
Can l do it now?

43:17.593 --> 43:21.085
Yeah. l got carried away. Sorry about that.

43:21.264 --> 43:23.289
-lt's your board. -My board.

43:24.233 --> 43:25.757
Okay, with the grain. l got it.

43:25.935 --> 43:28.165
Don't forget to eyeball it once in a while.

43:28.337 --> 43:32.000
-Long strokes, with the grain. -Not too long.

43:32.175 --> 43:33.972
Here we go.

43:37.947 --> 43:40.347
-You're doing it wrong. -Will you just let me--

43:40.516 --> 43:43.747
l can't-- No finesse when you're in my face. Okay?

43:43.920 --> 43:45.854
Just let me make the board.

43:46.022 --> 43:48.752
-Do you want my help? -No, l don't want your help.

43:48.925 --> 43:50.256
l don't want your help.

43:50.426 --> 43:52.394
-You don't want my help? -l don't want your help.

43:52.562 --> 43:55.622
-All right. Fine. -l want to make my board.

43:55.798 --> 43:59.359
-Build the board yourself, all right? -Thank you.

43:59.535 --> 44:02.834
l don't care what the board looks like. You're the one...

44:03.005 --> 44:05.974
-...who's got to ride the thing. -Fine. Thank you.

44:07.110 --> 44:11.342
-lt's in there somewhere. -Walk over there, please! Please.

44:11.814 --> 44:14.078
Don't cut yourself.

44:15.384 --> 44:16.942
So it's day three, yeah?

44:18.387 --> 44:21.379
l come across Pen Guans.

44:21.557 --> 44:24.993
l'm Chicken Joe. Joseph. lt's long for Joe.

44:25.561 --> 44:26.721
Sweet, man.

44:26.896 --> 44:31.162
And they treat me as their king and put me in a hot tub.

44:31.734 --> 44:34.362
lt is, l guess, their royal hot tub.

44:49.819 --> 44:52.049
lt got kind of hot and steamy.

44:52.255 --> 44:54.780
But really opened up my pores, you know?

44:56.993 --> 44:58.290
lt was kind of cool.

44:58.461 --> 45:01.157
They served me food while l was in there.

45:01.364 --> 45:04.026
lt was like dinner and a show.

45:14.544 --> 45:18.207
As enjoyable as it was, l still had a vision of my quest.

45:20.349 --> 45:24.183
Thank you. See you guys later. l gotta get going.

45:26.022 --> 45:27.546
Not again.

45:29.725 --> 45:31.784
You know what else it was? l had the board.

45:31.961 --> 45:33.656
The board was fine. The board was great.

45:36.999 --> 45:40.059
-How's it going? -lt's going great, man. lt's great.

45:40.536 --> 45:42.026
It did look a little rough.

45:42.205 --> 45:45.606
A little rough? The board looked a little-- lt's a work in progress, bro.

45:45.775 --> 45:47.675
You think it's good enough for the big waves?

45:47.843 --> 45:51.244
l think it's good enough for any wave.

45:52.715 --> 45:54.205
Hang on.

45:55.084 --> 45:59.544
-Okay, let's say l'm a big wave. -Hold on. No, no, no, no.

45:59.722 --> 46:01.553
-Hey, where you-- -Hold on!

46:01.724 --> 46:04.420
-Where are you going? -lt's my board, man, all right?

46:04.594 --> 46:07.563
Why don't you take your board and go try it out?

46:07.730 --> 46:11.325
Maybe l will. Piece of junk. Watch!

46:14.570 --> 46:17.801
Nice ride, man. Nice ride.

46:19.108 --> 46:21.008
This is supposed to be fun.

46:21.177 --> 46:24.908
l got three days until the contest. l don't have time for fun.

46:25.548 --> 46:27.914
No time for fun, huh?

46:28.084 --> 46:29.551
-Hey, Cody! -What?

46:29.719 --> 46:32.517
Bring me some clams when you come back!

46:32.688 --> 46:35.384
l'm not coming back!

46:35.558 --> 46:38.026
-He'll be back. -No, l won't!

46:38.194 --> 46:39.786
He'll be back.

46:40.229 --> 46:42.356
-You guys like barbecue? -Yeah, sure.

46:42.531 --> 46:44.089
Got some wood here.

46:44.934 --> 46:48.370
l wasted my whole day and l have nothing to show for it, which is--

46:53.242 --> 46:57.303
-l was just going to check on you... -That's why you were--

46:57.480 --> 46:58.777
...and the Geek.

46:58.948 --> 47:02.247
-Listen. The Geek is Big Z. -What?

47:02.418 --> 47:03.646
-l know. -You know?

47:03.819 --> 47:05.753
-How did you find out? -We went to the beach.

47:05.921 --> 47:07.149
-You got him to the beach? -Yeah.

47:07.323 --> 47:09.951
l've been trying to get Z out of that tree for 1 0 years...

47:10.126 --> 47:12.492
...and you got him all the way down to the beach in one day?

47:12.662 --> 47:14.186
This is fantastic!

47:16.499 --> 47:21.596
lt's amazing! Do you want to go somewhere fun?

47:21.804 --> 47:26.639
Do you want to go somewhere really, really fun?

47:26.809 --> 47:29.437
Unless you want-- Did you want to get back to Big Z?

47:29.612 --> 47:31.978
-l'm sorry. l shouldn't have invited you. -No, no, no.

47:32.148 --> 47:35.083
-What? Okay. No? -No, look. l want to have fun.

47:35.251 --> 47:37.515
-Okay. -Do l need mints or something?

47:37.687 --> 47:40.656
-You tell me. -No, you won't need mints.

47:41.390 --> 47:45.190
Z used to carry us up here on his shoulders. We'd have so much fun.

47:45.361 --> 47:47.989
-lt's one of my favorite spots. -Really?

47:48.197 --> 47:51.098
-Boy, to be 8 years old again. -What is this?

47:51.267 --> 47:53.258
You don't want to get all cut up, do you?

47:53.436 --> 47:54.767
Hold on. What are you doing?

47:54.937 --> 47:57.201
No, no, no. l'm out of here. l'm better off--

48:08.718 --> 48:10.709
lt's going down! No, no, no!

48:15.024 --> 48:19.085
-This is insane! -Stop fighting it, Cody! Just let go!

48:21.197 --> 48:22.824
All right!

48:27.269 --> 48:29.931
Now l'm in front of you. What's going on now?

48:30.106 --> 48:31.596
lt's not a race!

48:40.383 --> 48:43.284
Okay, wait, don't take the left-- Cody!

48:47.957 --> 48:51.984
-Give up, slowpoke! lt's over with now! -Not for long!

48:52.328 --> 48:54.523
Give up now, sucker!

48:58.701 --> 49:02.034
-l beat you! -Congratulations, you sure did.

49:02.204 --> 49:03.762
You should probably get out of there.

49:03.939 --> 49:06.203
Why is that? This stuff is-- Look at me. lt's so beautiful.

49:06.375 --> 49:07.967
Look at it. What is this stuff?

49:08.144 --> 49:10.977
See those things up above you? They're glowworms.

49:11.147 --> 49:15.607
So you're right beneath them. Yeah, that's poop.

49:25.628 --> 49:29.394
You know how some stinks stink and other stinks smell good?

49:29.565 --> 49:31.829
-Yeah. -This is, like, a good stink.

49:32.001 --> 49:32.990
A good stink?

49:33.669 --> 49:35.398
Can l tell you something personal?

49:35.571 --> 49:37.835
We're in the shower together. You can say whatever you want.

49:38.007 --> 49:42.444
l'm serious. l'm really, really jealous of you.

49:42.611 --> 49:43.737
Why?

49:43.913 --> 49:47.781
l couldn't get Z off his butt for the last 1 0 years...

49:47.950 --> 49:50.475
...and then you come along and....

49:50.653 --> 49:53.417
He must really think a lot of you.

49:53.589 --> 49:57.150
l don't know. l've been a jerk to him. l don't know what he thinks.

49:57.326 --> 49:59.419
-You haven't. -l have. l've been a jerk.

50:00.796 --> 50:04.163
-l have. -Then go not be a jerk.

50:04.834 --> 50:06.597
What does it matter to you anyways?

50:06.769 --> 50:09.465
He's my uncle. He's the only family l've got.

50:18.714 --> 50:20.113
Okay.

51:22.545 --> 51:24.274
Z? No.

51:24.947 --> 51:29.213
No, no, no, don't you do it. Z, don't do it. No.

51:29.385 --> 51:31.250
-No. -Let's see here.

51:31.420 --> 51:33.285
-l swear... -lt's stronger than l thought.

51:33.455 --> 51:36.788
-...if you break it-- -Should've been broken by now.

51:36.959 --> 51:39.621
Come on! Come on!

51:43.399 --> 51:45.060
Look at that.

51:46.669 --> 51:50.298
That's the best place in the world to be, in the tube.

51:50.472 --> 51:51.496
Really?

51:51.674 --> 51:56.077
Yeah. Better than winning, the trophy, all that stuff.

51:56.912 --> 52:00.279
Tube riding is the ultimate thing in surfing...

52:00.449 --> 52:02.644
...to ride inside the wave and make it out of it.

52:02.818 --> 52:04.410
It's all we want to do every day.

52:04.587 --> 52:07.522
It's almost impossible to describe.

52:07.690 --> 52:09.624
There's nothing I can compare it to.

52:09.792 --> 52:14.252
It's a feeling that not too many people will experience...

52:14.763 --> 52:16.424
...so it's special in that sense.

52:16.599 --> 52:17.964
Then you try to remember it.

52:18.133 --> 52:21.068
Like, ''I wish I could remember that, '' or ''I wish I could get that again. ''

52:21.236 --> 52:22.897
It's so addicting.

52:23.272 --> 52:27.106
Once you get inside you never want to get out.

52:27.309 --> 52:32.770
-Wow. That's amazing. -Yeah, man. Nothing like it.

52:32.948 --> 52:38.443
So, that aside, how many points would you get for getting tubed?

52:38.654 --> 52:40.952
Like, what does it depend on for the contest?

52:41.123 --> 52:43.353
-Points? -What?

52:43.559 --> 52:46.050
You know who you sound like right now?

52:46.228 --> 52:47.991
l promote happiness!

52:48.163 --> 52:51.792
Can you see the happiness emanating from me? What's wrong with you?

52:51.967 --> 52:53.798
-We're live. -Good. Good.

52:53.969 --> 52:58.269
l have to say, l have no doubt that this year's Big Z Memorial...

52:58.440 --> 52:59.771
...is gonna be the best ever.

53:01.176 --> 53:03.667
With the competition just one day away...

53:03.846 --> 53:08.340
...the excitement is definitely building here on Pen Gu Island.

53:28.704 --> 53:32.071
That didn't take too long. l feel lightheaded.

53:32.241 --> 53:33.469
So get this.

53:33.809 --> 53:37.870
On my search for Cody, l bump into my hot tub buddies again.

53:39.214 --> 53:41.409
l get it. You guys look hungry.

53:41.583 --> 53:44.814
You've probably got the munchies or something.

53:46.889 --> 53:49.153
Squidito on el stickito?

53:58.967 --> 54:02.835
Check it out! Dude, have you seen my friend Cody?

54:03.005 --> 54:05.735
He's kind of like a penguin.

54:05.908 --> 54:09.002
He's got a lot of black on him, a lot of white.

54:09.178 --> 54:12.670
-How did you learn how to surf? -l saw Big Z do it, actually.

54:12.848 --> 54:14.748
I don't think you were born yet.

54:14.917 --> 54:17.317
-l wasn't? -No, l don't think so.

54:17.586 --> 54:22.353
Lani? l like her when she teaches us because--

54:22.524 --> 54:24.253
Smudge! Not another one!

54:24.426 --> 54:26.951
l think he really has to go to the bathroom right now.

54:27.596 --> 54:29.325
What's next? The board is done.

54:29.498 --> 54:31.398
-The board is done? -The board is done.

54:31.567 --> 54:35.469
-Well, let's do some training. -Finally!

54:35.804 --> 54:38.898
-Can we get a shot of you-- -You've got to get it in a long shot.

54:39.942 --> 54:42.433
Hey, Z! Come on!

54:42.611 --> 54:44.545
-Where you going? -l thought we were going to train.

54:44.713 --> 54:48.171
Not in the water. Jeez. What are you thinking?

54:49.585 --> 54:52.713
-You want to surf like Big Z used to? -Yeah.

54:52.888 --> 54:55.584
l've got some tests here to figure out your potential.

54:55.758 --> 54:58.283
-Let's do it. -No, put them on your eyes.

54:58.460 --> 55:00.951
-Like this. -On my eyes.

55:03.665 --> 55:06.691
-Take it, Cody. -Can we do some training, seriously?

55:06.869 --> 55:08.996
What are you talking about? What do you think we're doing?

55:09.171 --> 55:11.196
Acting like nutjobs. That's what l think we're doing.

55:11.373 --> 55:13.773
Yeah, good. You're learning!

55:13.942 --> 55:15.967
And a big set comes in.

55:18.347 --> 55:20.042
Wipeout!

55:20.382 --> 55:22.282
-That's it! -Take it easy!

55:22.751 --> 55:24.343
This is getting ridiculous.

55:24.520 --> 55:25.953
-You having fun? -l hate you.

55:27.055 --> 55:28.488
Big, you know, slow:

55:30.392 --> 55:33.486
He does this flip over the top. All right, now you go.

55:35.597 --> 55:38.498
No joy, man. No joy. Fail.

55:39.468 --> 55:44.132
l'm starting to see it, man. l think l know what you're talking about.

55:45.073 --> 55:48.133
That's great. As long as we're all having fun, right?

55:48.410 --> 55:52.608
Z, wake up. Wake up, Z. Z!

56:01.223 --> 56:03.191
Hey, Z, breakfast!

56:05.194 --> 56:06.559
Not a chance.

56:06.895 --> 56:10.490
-Four, three, two... -You gotta get up early in the morning--

56:11.066 --> 56:12.158
...one.

56:21.109 --> 56:22.098
That is fun.

56:22.277 --> 56:25.212
-You're having fun? -l am. Yes. Now l am.

56:25.781 --> 56:26.975
Then, Cody...

56:27.149 --> 56:28.810
-...you passed! -What?

56:28.984 --> 56:31.475
You did it! You're ready! Let's surf!

56:31.653 --> 56:36.181
Don't play me, Z. We're surfing? Yes! Yes!

56:46.869 --> 56:48.336
Hey, check it--

56:55.043 --> 56:57.170
l didn't know you could surf!

57:03.418 --> 57:04.646
Relax!

57:04.820 --> 57:08.517
Long, slow, smooth.

57:08.690 --> 57:10.521
-Like making the board! -There you go.

57:10.692 --> 57:13.627
-All right. Okay. -Feels good, yeah?

57:24.840 --> 57:29.709
-You're in the water, Z! -Come on out. Get wet! Come on!

57:34.182 --> 57:37.879
Lani, thank you.

57:43.792 --> 57:45.555
Look at that!

57:58.674 --> 58:02.337
-Nice! That's it! Nice. -Great ride!

58:27.703 --> 58:29.500
Big Z is back!

58:40.816 --> 58:43.284
This is what it's all about.

58:44.086 --> 58:46.611
What could be better than this?

59:13.482 --> 59:16.076
I need some help on this landing for the high note

59:20.589 --> 59:23.387
Nice. Nice.

59:23.759 --> 59:25.852
-ls that the only song that you know? -Pretty much.

59:26.028 --> 59:28.496
You want to hear it again? lt goes like this.

59:28.730 --> 59:31.392
No? Okay. l got you there, didn't l?

59:31.566 --> 59:35.229
l must say you were quite amazing out there today.

59:35.404 --> 59:38.168
-You weren't so bad yourself, kiddo. -Thanks to this guy.

59:39.007 --> 59:43.569
-l just pointed you in a direction. -Question, Z.

59:44.746 --> 59:46.771
-Change your mind about the song? -No, no, no.

59:46.948 --> 59:48.415
Here, it goes something like this--

59:48.583 --> 59:51.313
l was wondering if you could come watch me ride tomorrow.

59:52.921 --> 59:55.321
Yeah, yeah. We'll both ride, man.

59:55.490 --> 01:00:00.154
-No, not just-- ln the contest. -Contest? What contest?

01:00:00.328 --> 01:00:02.523
The Big Z Memorial. Remember that one?

01:00:02.697 --> 01:00:04.324
l know l'm asking a lot...

01:00:04.499 --> 01:00:06.899
...but it would really, really be...

01:00:07.069 --> 01:00:10.197
...the biggest thing in the world to me if you could come.

01:00:12.274 --> 01:00:15.107
-You still want to be a part of that? -Absolutely.

01:00:15.677 --> 01:00:20.137
-Why do you want me there anyway? -l thought you'd want to be there.

01:00:20.315 --> 01:00:23.284
-l don't know why it's a big deal. -lt's no big deal.

01:00:23.585 --> 01:00:25.382
Why won't you come?

01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:26.882
-l'm not coming. -Why?

01:00:27.055 --> 01:00:28.852
-Give it a rest. -lt's getting cold, guys.

01:00:29.024 --> 01:00:30.582
-Tell me why you're hiding. -Hiding?

01:00:30.759 --> 01:00:33.125
-Why are you hiding? -l'll have to eat all this by myself.

01:00:33.295 --> 01:00:35.422
Why didn't you come back after you fell off the wave?

01:00:36.498 --> 01:00:38.625
That wave.

01:00:40.469 --> 01:00:45.600
That last day, winning had become everything to me.

01:00:45.941 --> 01:00:47.568
I knew I was gonna beat Tank.

01:00:48.877 --> 01:00:55.043
But then, you know, he starts to surf circles around me.

01:00:55.217 --> 01:00:58.277
I saw what he was doing. I couldn't do what he was doing.

01:00:59.087 --> 01:01:01.385
Times had changed.

01:01:02.491 --> 01:01:05.324
I didn't want to walk back on that beach with all my fans there.

01:01:05.494 --> 01:01:09.954
A loser. Everyone looking at Big Z, the loser, the has-been.

01:01:10.532 --> 01:01:12.193
So....

01:01:20.442 --> 01:01:23.343
Big Z's dead, and that's how it's gonna stay.

01:01:23.979 --> 01:01:26.140
Let me play you that song.

01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:30.318
What about ''never give up''? What about ''find a way''?

01:01:30.652 --> 01:01:35.589
-You're giving up. You're giving up! -Yeah, l'm giving up. That's my way.

01:01:36.057 --> 01:01:39.322
-Giving up. -l thought you were the one guy.

01:01:39.494 --> 01:01:42.463
You don't like it, find your own way.

01:01:44.232 --> 01:01:45.756
Leave me out of it.

01:01:46.568 --> 01:01:48.160
Leave me out of it.

01:02:15.730 --> 01:02:18.221
l messed up. l'm just--

01:02:18.433 --> 01:02:20.424
l'm...not good.

01:02:20.835 --> 01:02:23.565
This is when l needed someone. l needed him.

01:02:24.606 --> 01:02:27.507
lt's hard enough losing one dad, but....

01:02:28.577 --> 01:02:31.011
-What do you mean by--? -Nothing.

01:02:31.213 --> 01:02:33.511
Nothing, man. Forget it.

01:02:48.096 --> 01:02:50.394
Peaceful. Peaceful. l'm in peace. l come in peace.

01:02:50.599 --> 01:02:51.759
-Cody! -Joe!

01:02:52.167 --> 01:02:55.466
-l've been looking everywhere for you! -You've been looking for me?

01:02:55.637 --> 01:02:58.470
l didn't lose you on the whale. l'm not gonna lose you now.

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:02.076
-Thank you. Seriously, thank you. -Radical.

01:03:04.312 --> 01:03:06.780
They're starting! Cody, we gotta go! Come on!

01:03:06.982 --> 01:03:08.449
Wait a minute. Joe?

01:03:08.617 --> 01:03:09.709
Surfers riding....

01:03:09.884 --> 01:03:12.910
l'm sorry. Watch this, dude. l can speak their language.

01:03:16.825 --> 01:03:20.022
l totally need my board. l don't know where it is. l gotta go find it.

01:03:20.195 --> 01:03:22.390
-l'll see you in the lineup. -See you, Joe.

01:03:22.564 --> 01:03:25.089
-This is gonna be fun, huh? -See you.

01:03:26.701 --> 01:03:30.398
The tenth annual Big Z is about to get underway...

01:03:30.572 --> 01:03:33.370
...and, whoa, it is the day of days.

01:03:33.541 --> 01:03:36.738
Big mountainous bombs marching into our coastline.

01:03:37.045 --> 01:03:40.674
Kelly Slater, on a danger level, one to ten, give me a number.

01:03:40.849 --> 01:03:41.838
Twenty.

01:03:42.017 --> 01:03:44.042
-Wow. Rob? -There'll be blood.

01:03:44.219 --> 01:03:46.153
I'm scared, and I'm in the booth!

01:03:47.122 --> 01:03:49.283
-What are you doing here? -Mike.

01:03:49.457 --> 01:03:51.721
You're gonna kill yourself. Don't do this to yourself.

01:03:51.893 --> 01:03:53.224
Look what happened last time.

01:03:53.928 --> 01:03:56.192
-lt's good to see you back. -Are you serious?

01:03:56.364 --> 01:03:57.888
You're gonna be a real crowd pleaser.

01:03:58.066 --> 01:04:00.398
l'm telling you, these people are gonna eat you up.

01:04:00.568 --> 01:04:04.060
-l'll be expecting big things from you. -Thank you.

01:04:04.239 --> 01:04:06.469
People, big announcement. Cody Maverick, he's back.

01:04:06.641 --> 01:04:07.972
The Wipeout King is back...

01:04:08.143 --> 01:04:10.236
...and I'm gonna tell you, start looking for the sharks.

01:04:10.412 --> 01:04:12.471
They'll be circling because there's gonna be blood.

01:04:12.647 --> 01:04:14.080
Spectacular carnage today.

01:04:14.249 --> 01:04:18.185
Thank you! Reggie Belafonte. Little guy, big hair, big thoughts, big heart.

01:04:27.062 --> 01:04:31.021
Look at this. You're going down, snowflake.

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:35.431
l'm gonna make you wish you were never even hatched.

01:04:36.571 --> 01:04:39.096
You want to see my trophies?

01:04:48.717 --> 01:04:50.548
Arnold, no.

01:04:56.558 --> 01:04:59.550
About 2 4 surfers battling their way out to the--

01:05:00.595 --> 01:05:03.393
Good golly! Make that 1 8.

01:05:06.668 --> 01:05:09.068
Rob, after such a heavy wipeout earlier in the week...

01:05:09.237 --> 01:05:11.262
...what do you think is going through Maverick's mind?

01:05:11.439 --> 01:05:15.432
He's gonna have to stay focused and channel that energy into good places.

01:05:15.744 --> 01:05:17.405
When are you gonna get a life?

01:05:19.814 --> 01:05:21.577
You are a nobody.

01:05:22.851 --> 01:05:25.081
You should've stayed in Antarctica, kid.

01:05:49.644 --> 01:05:52.511
He made it! Yeah, good.

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:56.548
What an amazing first ride mind-blower from Maverick.

01:06:02.257 --> 01:06:03.918
Did you guys see that?

01:06:04.092 --> 01:06:07.186
Man. l thought l was gonna lose it, and then l just....

01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:11.331
l just let go, you know. l let go, and there it was.

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:15.262
Wow, it's been an amazing day...

01:06:15.437 --> 01:06:17.428
...of shredding in less than stellar conditions...

01:06:17.605 --> 01:06:20.540
...but I never would have guessed our three finalists.

01:06:20.708 --> 01:06:22.835
Well, Sal, it's no surprise that Tank Evans...

01:06:23.011 --> 01:06:26.105
...has just breezed his way into the finals.

01:06:26.281 --> 01:06:30.581
And Cody Maverick, from a horrible wipeout a few days ago to this.

01:06:32.954 --> 01:06:36.185
And Chicken Joe from Sheboygan. Who would have guessed it?

01:06:36.825 --> 01:06:40.124
I have never seen a finals like this.

01:06:41.262 --> 01:06:43.890
-We're in the finals, Joe. -No way! We get to surf some more?

01:06:44.065 --> 01:06:47.398
lsn't it exciting? Look at that. This is great, huh?

01:06:47.669 --> 01:06:51.002
You know, you should know this. The Tank loves you.

01:06:51.906 --> 01:06:54.340
Looks like this will be the easiest year ever.

01:06:55.410 --> 01:06:58.436
No way. Cody, did you hear that? lt's gonna be easy.

01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:01.842
Are you loving this?

01:07:04.252 --> 01:07:06.186
So who would you like to see win the trophy?

01:07:06.354 --> 01:07:08.948
lt's not so important to me.

01:07:09.123 --> 01:07:11.785
Friends are better than anything in the world.

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:13.154
Friends are forever.

01:07:13.795 --> 01:07:17.094
Trophies, you never know what they can have happen to them.

01:07:18.366 --> 01:07:21.199
-That was awesome, mate. -Muy impresivo, my friend.

01:07:21.369 --> 01:07:22.700
Thank you, bro. Thanks.

01:07:23.471 --> 01:07:24.870
-Finals. -Hey!

01:07:25.039 --> 01:07:27.701
Yeah. l know. l can't even--

01:07:28.643 --> 01:07:31.305
l think l can win this thing. lt's too much right now.

01:07:31.479 --> 01:07:33.970
-Well, that's all you came for. -What?

01:07:34.148 --> 01:07:37.242
-What is that supposed to mean? -You made it pretty clear last night...

01:07:37.418 --> 01:07:39.477
...that winning's more important to you than Z or me.

01:07:39.654 --> 01:07:42.054
But, hey, maybe you'll get to take your stupid trophy home.

01:07:42.223 --> 01:07:44.623
-Lani. Come on. -Come here, you!

01:07:45.093 --> 01:07:46.424
How about this, huh?

01:07:46.594 --> 01:07:51.657
Let me tell you something. You win this thing, we're going places!

01:07:51.866 --> 01:07:54.767
Look at this kid. He is a champ!

01:08:04.345 --> 01:08:08.509
Tank, nine-time defending champion. He will roll on you.

01:08:08.683 --> 01:08:12.175
Expect him to win this thing. It's basically a contest for second place.

01:08:12.353 --> 01:08:17.017
First, l'm gonna take you down. Then l'm gonna fry the chicken.

01:08:19.193 --> 01:08:22.094
That cloud looks just like a kitten.

01:08:35.609 --> 01:08:37.407
Maverick and Evans take off.

01:08:38.112 --> 01:08:39.136
Mine!

01:08:39.314 --> 01:08:41.645
And it's Evans dropping in.

01:08:44.419 --> 01:08:47.411
And Tank's playing games, blocking Maverick's every move.

01:08:48.356 --> 01:08:49.880
Maverick sticks a rail.

01:08:51.091 --> 01:08:55.791
Tank Evans down! I have never, ever seen this before!

01:08:57.765 --> 01:08:59.255
But I'd love to see it again.

01:08:59.434 --> 01:09:03.063
Cody trying to take back the wave that Tank snaked from him.

01:09:03.237 --> 01:09:05.535
Evans toying with him, not paying attention.

01:09:05.707 --> 01:09:07.937
And there's the outside rail. Evans goes down.

01:09:08.109 --> 01:09:12.636
And it's Maverick with this new-school move. We'll call it ''The Maverick. ''

01:09:18.453 --> 01:09:21.616
And look at this. Maverick scoring big.

01:09:22.689 --> 01:09:27.127
Oh, it's so cute. lt's got little paws and the whiskers.

01:09:30.098 --> 01:09:32.930
Chicken Joe with a no-paddle drop-in!

01:09:34.602 --> 01:09:37.435
-Here we go! -Nobody needs to help this chicken.

01:09:38.473 --> 01:09:39.701
l'm flying!

01:09:41.576 --> 01:09:46.377
Maverick and Joe tied, and no score for Tank Evans? Unbelievable.

01:09:47.982 --> 01:09:51.850
Surfers, this is your final wave!

01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:56.354
-Joe, this is it. This wave wins it. -Yeah, man!

01:09:58.359 --> 01:10:02.693
This wave is stacking up to be a beautiful tube.

01:10:03.331 --> 01:10:06.562
Maverick should score big on this one!

01:10:08.403 --> 01:10:10.735
But wait! Evans drops in.

01:10:10.905 --> 01:10:14.500
It looks like Evans is gonna take out the chicken.

01:10:19.914 --> 01:10:21.245
What's Maverick doing?

01:10:21.416 --> 01:10:24.317
-Go, Joe, go! -Got it! Let's go!

01:10:24.485 --> 01:10:27.386
I don't believe this. This contest was Maverick's to win.

01:10:27.588 --> 01:10:31.319
Now Evans pushing Maverick out of bounds and into The Boneyards.

01:10:44.038 --> 01:10:46.871
-Tank, look out! -You look out!

01:11:22.243 --> 01:11:23.232
Code!

01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:26.769
Z!

01:11:30.918 --> 01:11:32.818
-Cody, come on. -Z!

01:11:32.987 --> 01:11:36.753
Paddle! Come on! Dig! Faster! Come on. Dig!

01:11:37.992 --> 01:11:40.392
Don't dig! Don't dig!

01:11:40.561 --> 01:11:41.653
What?

01:11:42.330 --> 01:11:44.855
Let the wave carry you!

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:47.161
You're gonna have to time it!

01:11:47.702 --> 01:11:50.830
You're gonna come right here, right to me!

01:11:54.375 --> 01:11:56.366
Five...four....

01:11:56.611 --> 01:11:59.205
Three...two...one.

01:12:04.285 --> 01:12:05.752
Z!

01:12:21.035 --> 01:12:22.593
Where's Cody?

01:12:26.974 --> 01:12:29.033
Don't touch it! Don't touch that!

01:12:29.210 --> 01:12:32.304
This is a reminder of the young surfer...

01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:37.543
...who gave his life for the sport he loved.

01:12:41.756 --> 01:12:43.553
There you are.

01:12:48.329 --> 01:12:51.628
l can't believe it! l can't believe it.

01:12:52.834 --> 01:12:54.165
You came back.

01:12:54.669 --> 01:12:57.331
You saved my life, man. Thank you.

01:12:57.505 --> 01:13:00.872
Hey, hey, come on. You're gonna tip us!

01:13:02.710 --> 01:13:05.338
Well, l lost.

01:13:07.014 --> 01:13:08.709
Me too.

01:13:10.852 --> 01:13:13.844
Come on. Let's go, loser.

01:13:14.689 --> 01:13:16.054
You want to help me out here?

01:13:16.224 --> 01:13:21.355
You know the routine. Come on. Long. That's it. Smooth, you know. Come on.

01:13:21.696 --> 01:13:26.690
Young Joey MacEnroe was a beacon for a new generation.

01:13:26.868 --> 01:13:29.837
May he rest in peace.

01:13:31.739 --> 01:13:34.799
So, what am l bid for the board? Who'll give me 30? 30, come on.

01:13:34.976 --> 01:13:37.137
-Don't touch his stuff, man. -Pal, if you want to bid--

01:13:37.311 --> 01:13:39.506
-Give me that. -Hey--!

01:13:45.253 --> 01:13:46.982
Hey. Hey, everyone.

01:13:47.989 --> 01:13:50.287
-How you been? -Oh, my gosh!

01:13:50.491 --> 01:13:52.652
-Yeah... -Hey, man, that's Z.

01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:54.418
...that's me.

01:13:54.595 --> 01:13:56.825
Skank, what's happening, man?

01:13:56.998 --> 01:13:59.660
Got a little sand in your egg sac there, fella.

01:13:59.834 --> 01:14:02.166
-Where have you been, Z? -What happened?

01:14:03.037 --> 01:14:04.368
Oh, you know...

01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:11.334
...l got lost for a little while. But that kid there, Cody...

01:14:12.546 --> 01:14:15.379
...he pointed the way back.

01:14:26.227 --> 01:14:28.422
Could you please shut that off? Could you give me a minute?

01:14:34.802 --> 01:14:36.736
Check it out! How about this?

01:14:36.904 --> 01:14:39.372
You want to talk about talent scout? People find talent.

01:14:39.573 --> 01:14:45.239
l bring them back from the dead. The now living legend, ladies and--

01:14:45.413 --> 01:14:46.744
-Shut up. -What? Shut up?

01:14:46.914 --> 01:14:50.907
l'm not a legend. l'm a guy looking for some nice waves, some good friends.

01:14:51.419 --> 01:14:55.048
Hey, guys, the swell is happening over on the north shore!

01:14:55.222 --> 01:14:56.587
l'm right behind you, Z.

01:14:56.757 --> 01:14:58.088
Ouch, that hurt.

01:15:00.227 --> 01:15:04.493
Come back here! You don't just walk away! Come on!

01:15:05.866 --> 01:15:07.231
He's taking this loss pretty hard.

01:15:07.401 --> 01:15:10.370
Tank, how does it feel to lose after nine time--

01:15:12.006 --> 01:15:15.237
l wasn't kissing her. You can't have her!

01:15:18.779 --> 01:15:19.768
Can we get a few words?

01:15:19.947 --> 01:15:22.609
You gave up the trophy to help Joe. What's that about?

01:15:22.783 --> 01:15:25.684
You know, Rob, that's what friends do.

01:15:25.853 --> 01:15:28.981
-How's it feel to win, Joe? -l won?

01:15:29.156 --> 01:15:32.455
Come on! l'll tell my mom. Gimme. Gimme!

01:15:34.128 --> 01:15:36.995
Oh, Lia! Oh, Lia.

01:15:37.164 --> 01:15:40.759
Don't you walk away from me! l am Reggie Belafon--

01:15:42.269 --> 01:15:45.796
Turn that thing off. Mikey! You are so fired!

01:15:46.407 --> 01:15:49.035
l can't imagine a better day.

01:15:55.216 --> 01:15:59.209
Dude, this-- This whole experience has just been--

01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:02.321
lt's amazing. Z?

01:16:02.490 --> 01:16:07.393
l don't think l've ever had a better friend to me in my life.

01:16:07.561 --> 01:16:11.224
It's just really cool to have everything I need.

01:16:12.099 --> 01:16:14.567
-Don't do it. Help! -Arnold!

01:16:14.735 --> 01:16:18.136
To be honest, man, l'm kind of, like, bored of talking about myself.

01:16:18.305 --> 01:16:21.968
So, is that cool? You guys got what you need?

01:16:22.143 --> 01:16:24.441
-We got it. -All right. Be good!

01:16:33.054 --> 01:16:34.578
Cowabunga!

01:17:42.623 --> 01:17:44.557
Of course we're proud of him!

01:17:44.725 --> 01:17:46.556
What mother wouldn't be proud of him?

01:17:46.727 --> 01:17:48.991
We're so full of proudness.

01:17:49.163 --> 01:17:51.063
You know what? He followed his dream...

01:17:51.232 --> 01:17:54.998
...and he went out there, and now he's coming home with the trophy.

01:17:55.169 --> 01:17:57.160
l can't wait to see his trophy.

01:17:57.338 --> 01:17:59.329
There's not really a trophy.

01:18:00.074 --> 01:18:02.508
ls there, like, a big shell or something like that?

01:18:02.676 --> 01:18:05.406
There's no shell. There's no trophy. Well, he didn't win.

01:18:05.579 --> 01:18:06.603
What?

01:18:06.981 --> 01:18:09.973
How bad was it? Did he get smoked?

01:18:10.184 --> 01:18:13.347
-He was in the finals. -Second place? That's losing.

01:18:13.521 --> 01:18:15.853
-Winning is not everything, Glen. -Right.

01:18:16.023 --> 01:18:17.513
Look at what Cody did--

01:18:17.691 --> 01:18:19.852
Go back to the ''winning isn't everything'' thing.

01:18:20.094 --> 01:18:22.358
That doesn't compute, really.

01:18:22.530 --> 01:18:28.025
You know what, Glen? l really hope someday you can be more like Cody.

01:18:28.502 --> 01:18:29.969
This interview is over.

01:25:00.627 --> 01:25:03.027
Remember when were talking about you leaving? That was great.

01:25:03.196 --> 01:25:04.823
Remember when you were gonna go?

01:25:04.998 --> 01:25:07.023
-We were gonna go-- -You should still go.

01:25:07.267 --> 01:25:08.325
It's technical equipment.

01:25:08.502 --> 01:25:12.495
l know what l'm doing. l can unplug one of your little Hollywood devices.

01:25:13.006 --> 01:25:15.304
The lighting thing, whatever you call that...

01:25:15.475 --> 01:25:17.340
...and then the microphone thing.

01:25:17.511 --> 01:25:18.842
Go back to Hollywood.

01:25:19.012 --> 01:25:20.502
Cody would never do this.
