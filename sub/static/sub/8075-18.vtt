11:26.519 --> 11:28.055
And then we stopped by
the Hall of Presidents.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.156
Which was just the best.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.224
Zachary Taylor
looked right at me.

11:31.258 --> 11:34.394
Oh, and guess
where we ended up.

11:34.427 --> 11:36.797
BOTH: Yo-ho, yo-ho, a
pirate's life for me.

11:36.830 --> 11:37.865
Ahoy!

11:37.898 --> 11:41.068
Morons off the port bow.
Give me the patch.

11:45.038 --> 11:48.541
Can I keep the hook?

11:48.575 --> 11:49.676
Come on, Darlene.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.711
Do you want to go to the
Swiss Family Treehouse?

11:51.745 --> 11:54.748
Not unless they have
cable and a wet bar.

11:54.782 --> 11:56.549
Well, what about the teacups?

11:56.583 --> 11:57.450
No.

11:57.484 --> 11:58.518
No more rides.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.153
Oh, come on, Darlene.

12:00.187 --> 12:01.554
One more word out
of you, and there'll

12:01.588 --> 12:03.991
be no more rides for you either,
pal, if you know what I mean.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.295
You know, DJ, I
think it would be

12:08.328 --> 12:10.864
fun to just spend the rest
of the day with Darlene,

12:10.898 --> 12:12.933
just sitting.

12:12.966 --> 12:15.602
You're not going to
be just sitting, David.

12:15.635 --> 12:17.604
I mean, in a minute, I'm going
to have you go fetch me a Coke.

12:26.513 --> 12:27.815
I can't believe it!

12:27.848 --> 12:29.249
It's Goofy.

12:29.282 --> 12:32.385
No way.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.087
Thank you so much, Goofy.

12:39.392 --> 12:40.794
[chuckling]

12:43.396 --> 12:44.197
Bye!

12:47.767 --> 12:49.202
Hey.

12:49.236 --> 12:50.403
Who was that guy?

12:50.437 --> 12:52.005
What guy?

12:52.039 --> 12:53.740
You know who
I'm talking about.

12:53.773 --> 12:54.808
You mean Goofy?

12:54.842 --> 12:55.876
Mark, he's a character.

12:55.909 --> 12:57.577
Oh, and I'm not?

12:57.610 --> 12:58.946
That's so typical.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.881
You know, you take your wife
to the big city, full of guys

13:00.914 --> 13:03.917
in their fancy suits and
their big puppy dog eyes,

13:03.951 --> 13:05.318
and all of a sudden
plain old Mark

13:05.352 --> 13:09.056
just ain't good enough for her.
- Come on, Mark.

13:09.089 --> 13:11.558
Let's just go.

13:11.591 --> 13:12.559
Hey.

13:12.592 --> 13:13.460
Don't you look at him.

13:13.493 --> 13:16.496
Don't look at him!

13:16.529 --> 13:17.497
Mark, that was Dopey.

13:17.530 --> 13:18.398
I don't care.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.167
It worked.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.069
[arabic music]

13:39.853 --> 13:41.221
[applause]

13:42.389 --> 13:43.390
Yeah!

13:43.423 --> 13:45.358
Man, you guys put
the rock in Morocco.

13:45.392 --> 13:47.895
Hey, you know this one?

13:47.928 --> 13:50.497
[singing nasally]

13:59.539 --> 14:02.910
[more arabic music]

14:25.933 --> 14:28.235
My brother and my
boyfriend on the Dumbo ride,

14:28.268 --> 14:30.070
and me without a camera
to throw at them.

14:39.179 --> 14:39.980
Shoo, Pooh.

14:44.117 --> 14:44.918
Are you finished?

14:48.255 --> 14:49.056
All right, wait.

14:53.526 --> 14:56.496
Wow, I'm really going
to hate myself for this.

14:56.529 --> 14:57.965
I've worked really
hard cultivating

14:57.998 --> 15:01.868
my own special brand
of cool sophistication.

15:01.901 --> 15:05.738
But you're the first book
I ever remember reading.

15:05.772 --> 15:10.677
And the truth is, you've always
kind of been my favorite.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.314
You know, I've been
into you since you

15:14.347 --> 15:16.016
got stuck in that hollow tree.

15:16.049 --> 15:17.350
You know, because you
ate too much honey

15:17.384 --> 15:19.719
and then you couldn't get out.

15:19.752 --> 15:23.756
And, uh, I love you.

15:23.790 --> 15:24.657
I love you.

15:24.691 --> 15:28.128
Oh my god, I love you.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.729
I'm hugging you.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.631
I'm hugging Winnie the Pooh!

15:36.203 --> 15:37.804
Space Mountain, here we come.

15:40.974 --> 15:42.375
This is a Magic Kingdom.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.380
Yeah, a creepy kingdom.

15:55.488 --> 15:58.525
See what Grammy
bought for you.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.360
Look at that.

16:00.393 --> 16:01.261
There.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.996
Oh, look at us. oh, look at us.

16:03.030 --> 16:05.332
We're the Three Mouseketeers.

16:05.365 --> 16:09.269
Well, I guess I'm the only one
with the stuff to be Annette.

16:11.938 --> 16:15.708
(SINGING) Zip-a-dee-doo-dah,
zip-a-dee-ay,

16:15.742 --> 16:18.645
my oh my, what a wonderful day.

16:18.678 --> 16:22.949
Plenty of sunshine
going our way.

16:22.982 --> 16:26.853
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay.

16:26.886 --> 16:28.755
[applause]

16:29.889 --> 16:30.757
Too kind.

16:30.790 --> 16:32.025
I'm so embarrassed.

16:32.059 --> 16:35.095
Really, I'm just singing
to my grandchildren.

16:35.128 --> 16:37.430
I mean, it's been
years since I tried

16:37.464 --> 16:40.400
to do this professionally.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.269
(SINGING) Second-hand hats.

16:42.302 --> 16:46.706
I'm wearing second-hand clothes.

16:46.739 --> 16:52.045
That's why they call
me second-hand Rose!

16:52.079 --> 16:55.848
Even our piano in the parlor--

17:04.657 --> 17:06.759
Ein beer, por favor.

17:06.793 --> 17:08.995
So, this is Germany, huh?

17:09.028 --> 17:10.163
This is incredible.

17:10.197 --> 17:11.498
You know, I'm glad
I stopped by here,

17:11.531 --> 17:14.367
because this is the
country I know most about.

17:14.401 --> 17:18.471
So, where's that
Sergeant Schultz, huh?

17:18.505 --> 17:19.439
[chuckling]

17:19.472 --> 17:20.340
Sergeant Schultz.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.341
I kill me.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.243
Do not turn around.

17:23.276 --> 17:24.711
My name is Zoe.

17:24.744 --> 17:26.946
I am with the
French Underground.

17:26.979 --> 17:29.882
I've come to liberate you.

17:29.916 --> 17:31.951
How do I know you're
not an impostor?

17:31.984 --> 17:36.156
To prove I am French, bring
me a snail, and I will eat it.

17:36.189 --> 17:37.090
Not good enough.

17:37.124 --> 17:38.491
I need more proof.

17:38.525 --> 17:41.094
I will eat that snail
covered with the stinky cheese

17:41.128 --> 17:43.963
that smells like the feet.

17:43.996 --> 17:45.432
Anyone can say it.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.234
To prove to you
that I am French,

17:47.267 --> 17:48.768
let me give you the kiss.

17:51.604 --> 17:54.040
I need more.

17:54.073 --> 17:58.578
In the dresser drawer, the
bottom drawer, underneath

17:58.611 --> 18:03.082
the socks, is a bag of Cheetos.

18:03.116 --> 18:03.916
My love!

18:06.786 --> 18:11.124
Jerry Lewis is le
supreme genius, no?

18:11.158 --> 18:15.027
Vive la professor de la Nutty.

18:15.061 --> 18:16.863
Oui!

18:16.896 --> 18:18.931
It grieves me, my
love, to tell you this.

18:18.965 --> 18:24.604
But the Cheetos, they are gone.

18:24.637 --> 18:25.472
Damn this war.

18:37.617 --> 18:38.751
This is so cool.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.687
I can't believe we're
on Big Thunder Mountain.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.190
I heard this ride goes so
fast that it stretches your skin

18:43.223 --> 18:45.392
until your skull flies
out your mouth hole.

18:50.463 --> 18:51.831
[shouting]

18:54.901 --> 18:56.769
[shouting]

19:26.098 --> 19:28.201
You know, honey, I've been
all over this great big world

19:28.235 --> 19:30.136
and seen a lot of
wondrous things.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.505
But I couldn't wait to
get back to the States,

19:32.539 --> 19:36.276
back to the cutest
girl in the world.

19:36.309 --> 19:38.345
Look at all the families, Dan.

19:38.378 --> 19:41.214
Everybody is so happy.

19:41.248 --> 19:42.249
OK.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.850
This is my parents'
number in Lanford.

19:43.883 --> 19:46.353
And this is my dorm
room in Chicago.

19:46.386 --> 19:48.555
And let's not make this one
of those things, you know,

19:48.588 --> 19:49.822
where we say we'll
call each other

19:49.856 --> 19:50.657
and then we don't, you know.

20:10.710 --> 20:13.713
I'm only saying, you should
consider some dramatic growth.

20:13.746 --> 20:16.215
I mean, you've already
proved you can do comedies.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.090
Man, this is great.

20:24.123 --> 20:26.793
What do you say, next year we
cash in your life insurance

20:26.826 --> 20:29.262
policy and we go on a cruise?

20:29.296 --> 20:31.331
I don't think that would
be the smart thing to do.

20:31.364 --> 20:32.164
Done.

20:36.503 --> 20:40.373
[epic music]

21:13.272 --> 21:16.242
Room service!

21:16.275 --> 21:17.577
About time you got here.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.111
I'm starving.

21:19.145 --> 21:20.079
I apologize.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.348
There was fog over Atlanta.

21:24.517 --> 21:25.885
I really appreciate
your flying

21:25.918 --> 21:27.920
all the way from Orlando.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.221
Oh, no!

21:29.255 --> 21:33.225
I ordered a whole wheat toast.
- My mistake.

21:33.259 --> 21:35.428
Back in a jiffy.

21:35.462 --> 21:36.696
There'll be a
buck in it for you!

21:43.169 --> 21:48.174
You know that whole Disney
operation is tops with me.

21:48.207 --> 21:50.877
[theme music]
