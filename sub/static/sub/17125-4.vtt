 AT THE AUDIENCE.

08:22.833 --> 08:24.675

 IT´S ONLY FOUR BLOCKS.

08:24.675 --> 08:26.707
A LOT CAN HAPPEN
 IN FOUR BLOCKS.

08:26.707 --> 08:29.139
HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT´S GOING ON
 OUT THERE.

08:29.139 --> 08:31.742
HE´S NOT LIKE ME WHEN
 I WAS A KID, ANGIE.

08:31.742 --> 08:33.143

 BY HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS 2.

08:56.006 --> 08:59.740

09:13.323 --> 09:14.955
GOOD. OKAY.

09:14.955 --> 09:17.187
NOW, MAX, WHAT IF SOMEONE CAME
 UP TO YOU AND SAID,

09:17.187 --> 09:19.960
"YOUR MOM TOLD ME TO GIVE YOU
 A RIDE HOME"?

09:19.960 --> 09:21.091
I STILL WOULDN´T GO.

 BAD ACCIDENT,

 DIDN´T COME RIGHT AWAY,

 TOOK YOUR TIME.

 HERE, IS HE, MOMMY?"

10:06.376 --> 10:10.941
AND I´D LOOK IN THE PAPER AND
 TELL YOU, "IT DOESN´T SAY."

10:10.941 --> 10:12.683
YEAH, I REMEMBER.

10:12.683 --> 10:16.817
NO "GREEN EGGS AND HAM."
 NO "CAT IN THE HAT."

10:16.817 --> 10:19.720
JUST "NUT KILLS 12."
 NIGHT-NIGHT.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.693
OKAY. YOU CAN LAUGH,
 BUT IT WORKED.

10:28.799 --> 10:30.060
WHAT? WHO´S THERE?

10:30.060 --> 10:33.633
SHH. WE NEED YOUR VCR.

10:33.633 --> 10:34.965
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:34.965 --> 10:36.366
I´M SHOWING MAX A MOVIE,

10:36.366 --> 10:39.139
AND I DON´T WANT YOUR MOM
 TO KNOW.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.871
WELL, I WANT A NEW SWEATER.

10:40.871 --> 10:42.172
I´M SURE WE CAN REACH SOME SORT
 OF AGREEMENT.

10:42.172 --> 10:43.744
HERE´S THE AGREEMENT --

10:43.744 --> 10:46.847
YOU DON´T TELL MOM,
 AND I´LL DO WHATEVER I WANT.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.178
ALL RIGHT.

10:48.178 --> 10:49.249
THIS MOVIE MIGHT BE A LITTLE
 MATURE FOR YOU,

10:49.249 --> 10:50.981
BUT I THINK IT´S MORE IMPORTANT

10:50.981 --> 10:53.253
THAT YOU LEARN THAT NOT EVERYONE
 OUT THERE IS A NICE PERSON.

10:53.253 --> 10:54.725
WHAT´S THE MOVIE?

10:54.725 --> 10:56.426
"TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE."

10:56.426 --> 10:59.359
I CUED IT UP TO
 THE EDUCATIONAL PART.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.063
[ CHAIN SAW BUZZING ]

11:03.063 --> 11:06.797
[ MAX AND CARMEN SCREAMING ]

11:06.797 --> 11:08.869
WHAT´S GOING ON IN HERE?

11:08.869 --> 11:11.942
NOTHING.
 WHAT´S GOING ON OUT THERE?

11:14.404 --> 11:17.748
"TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE"?
 ARE YOU INSANE?

11:17.748 --> 11:19.009
NOT COMPARED TO THEM.

11:19.009 --> 11:21.011
ANGIE, THIS IS HOW KIDS LEARN.

11:21.011 --> 11:23.984
THEY WATCH SCARY STUFF,
 THEY GET NIGHTMARES,

11:23.984 --> 11:25.816
THEY LEARN TO BE CAREFUL.

11:25.816 --> 11:30.690
MAX DOESN´T NEED TO WATCH THESE
 MOVIES TO WALK TO SCHOOL,

11:30.690 --> 11:33.894
WHICH HE IS DOING
 MONDAY MORNING.

11:33.894 --> 11:36.026
I´LL TAKE THIS.

11:38.128 --> 11:40.470
WELL, THERE´S NO LESSON HERE,

11:40.470 --> 11:45.005
BUT LET´S SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
 LEPRECHAUNS GO BAD.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.483
OKAY. THE NEXT CONTESTANT

11:53.483 --> 11:57.417
FOR THE CAR-POOL OPENING IS
 DANNY BOY.

11:57.417 --> 11:58.819
HE´S ON LINE 2.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.921
YOU´RE ON, DANNY BOY.

12:00.921 --> 12:03.323
I want to be in your car pool,

12:03.323 --> 12:07.357
you know, for the
 environmentally concerned.

12:07.357 --> 12:11.401
I heard that there´s a hole in
 the end zone,

12:11.401 --> 12:16.506
and I´m lonely.

12:16.506 --> 12:20.040
YOU´D HAVE TO COME TO WORK
 EVERY DAY.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.442
Not on the days that I drive!

12:24.144 --> 12:25.475
BYE, DANNY BOY.

12:25.475 --> 12:27.247
SEND THE NEXT ONE IN.

12:27.247 --> 12:31.982
HEY, UM, I WANT A CHANCE TO GET
 BACK IN THE CAR POOL.

12:31.982 --> 12:33.854
STATE YOUR NAME.

12:33.854 --> 12:35.425
YOU KNOW MY NAME.

12:35.425 --> 12:36.957
STATE YOUR NAME.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.959
ERNESTO CARDENAS.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.961
THIS DOPE WILL DO ANYTHING.

12:40.961 --> 12:44.464
SKIP AROUND LIKE A PONY
 AND SLAP YOUR OWN ASS.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.536
ERNIE!

12:46.536 --> 12:48.238
NO, MAN.

12:48.238 --> 12:51.071
WE´RE JUST ASKING EVERYBODY WHAT
 KIND OF CAR THEY DRIVE

12:51.071 --> 12:53.073
TO SEE HOW THEY´LL FIT
 IN THE GROUP.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.945
OH. I DRIVE A SUBARU BRAT.

12:54.945 --> 12:56.206
I´LL BE HONEST --

12:56.206 --> 12:59.009
THERE´S NO RADIO, NO AIR
 CONDITIONING,

12:59.009 --> 13:02.512
AND ONCE IN A BLUE MOON, FIRE
 COMES OUT OF THE VENTS.

13:02.512 --> 13:04.955
NEXT!

13:04.955 --> 13:07.417
NO. I-I PREPARED A JOKE.

13:07.417 --> 13:08.819
KNOCK, KNOCK.

13:08.819 --> 13:10.260
WHO´S THERE?

13:10.260 --> 13:11.221
BANANA.

13:11.221 --> 13:12.262
BANANA WHO?

13:12.262 --> 13:13.994
KNOCK, KNOCK.
 WHO´S THERE?

13:13.994 --> 13:16.026
BANANA.
 BANANA WHO?!

13:16.026 --> 13:18.498
WOULD YOU SAY "ORANGE"
 AND GET OUT OF HERE ALREADY?!

13:18.498 --> 13:21.801
HEY, GUYS, I´M SORRY.
 I CAN´T WAIT ANY LONGER.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.373
I GOTTA PICK UP MY NEW VAN.

13:23.373 --> 13:27.077
IF IT MATTERS, IT´S GOT A VCR,
 LITTLE TVs IN THE HEADRESTS.

13:28.538 --> 13:29.579
COLOR?

13:29.579 --> 13:30.580
OH, YEAH.

13:30.580 --> 13:32.582
HEY, ERNIE, KNOCK, KNOCK.

13:32.582 --> 13:33.914
WHO´S THERE?

13:33.914 --> 13:37.247
NOT YOU, BROTHER.

13:37.247 --> 13:39.049
YOU START ON MONDAY, FRANK.

13:39.049 --> 13:41.992
PICK UP GEORGE FIRST,
 THEN COME BY MY HOUSE.

13:41.992 --> 13:43.193
HONK A FEW TIMES,

13:43.193 --> 13:45.996
GET OUT OF YOUR CAR,
 SKIP AROUND,

13:45.996 --> 13:47.457
AND SLAP YOURSELF ON THE ASS.

13:47.457 --> 13:48.899
MOM!

13:48.899 --> 13:51.031
I JUST WANT TO SEE SOMEBODY
 DO IT.

13:54.204 --> 13:56.536
SO, MONDAY´S THE BIG DAY, HUH?

13:56.536 --> 14:00.340
GONNA LET MAX WALK TO SCHOOL
 OR WHAT?

14:00.340 --> 14:02.512
ANGIE SAYS YES,
 BUT I DON´T KNOW.

14:02.512 --> 14:06.846
ALL OF A SUDDEN, I´M A CRAZY MAN
 FOR WORRYING ABOUT MY KID.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.079
HEY, HERE´S AN IDEA,
 EINSTEIN.

14:09.079 --> 14:11.521
WHY DON´T YOU FOLLOW HIM
 TO SCHOOL?

14:11.521 --> 14:12.983
BUT WHAT IF HE SEES ME?

14:12.983 --> 14:15.155
I DON´T WANT TO HURT
 HIS CONFIDENCE.

14:15.155 --> 14:17.627
FRANK´S PICKING YOU UP MONDAY.
 LET HIM DRIVE YOU.

14:17.627 --> 14:20.360
WHY WEREN´T YOU THIS SMART
 WHEN I WAS A KID?

14:20.360 --> 14:21.892
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

14:21.892 --> 14:24.434
I KNOW YOU FOLLOWED ME TO SCHOOL
 IN YOUR CAR.

14:24.434 --> 14:25.135
NO, I DIDN´T.

14:25.135 --> 14:26.536
YES, YOU DID.

14:26.536 --> 14:28.638
WE HAD A GOLD CHEVY CITATION
 WITH THREE HUBCAPS.

14:28.638 --> 14:32.372
GEORGE, THAT WAS 90% OF OUR
 NEIGHBORHOOD.

14:38.578 --> 14:41.111
OKAY, HONEY, YOU REMEMBER
 EVERYTHING WE TALKED ABOUT?

14:41.111 --> 14:42.052
YOU GOT MY CELLPHONE?

14:42.052 --> 14:43.413
IT´S IN MY POCKET.

14:43.413 --> 14:45.455
AND WHAT NUMBER DO YOU CALL
 IF YOU´RE IN TROUBLE?

14:45.455 --> 14:46.616
911.

14:46.616 --> 14:48.989
GOOD BOY.
 GEORGE, MAX IS LEAVING!

14:48.989 --> 14:51.321
WAIT, I HAVE TO LEAVE
 BEFORE YOU.

14:51.321 --> 14:53.393
I CAN´T BEAR TO WATCH YOU GO.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.665
I CAN´T WAIT.
 I´M GONNA BE LATE.

14:55.665 --> 14:58.668
OKAY. THEN I NEED SOMETHING
 OUT OF YOUR BACKPACK.

14:58.668 --> 15:00.170
HEY!

15:00.170 --> 15:02.532
AN ERASER IN THE SHAPE
 OF AN ARMY MAN.

15:02.532 --> 15:03.533
GOT IT! BYE!

15:03.533 --> 15:06.136
HERE, HONEY.

15:07.537 --> 15:10.080
HEY, FRANK, THANKS
 FOR COMING BY EARLY

15:10.080 --> 15:12.142
SO I CAN GET A HEAD START
 ON MY KID.

15:12.142 --> 15:13.583
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.

15:13.583 --> 15:15.415
LISTEN, JUST SO I KNOW,
 FOR MY OWN COMFORT LEVEL,

15:15.415 --> 15:17.217
WHY ARE WE FOLLOWING HIM?

15:17.217 --> 15:20.991
TODAY´S THE FIRST DAY HE´S
 WALKING TO SCHOOL ALONE.

15:20.991 --> 15:23.293
THERE HE IS.
 START DRIVING.

15:25.555 --> 15:27.927
YOU KNOW, THEY GOT A CHIP YOU
 CAN PUT

15:27.927 --> 15:30.630
IN BETWEEN DOGS´ SHOULDER
 BLADES NOWADAYS

15:30.630 --> 15:33.063
SO YOU ALWAYS KNOW
 WHERE THEY ARE.

15:33.063 --> 15:35.335
SO IF ANYTHING HAPPENS
 TO THIS KID,

15:35.335 --> 15:37.267
YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET A DOG.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.442
HEY, HOW LONG YOU GONNA
 DO THIS?

15:42.442 --> 15:44.574
JUST UNTIL I´M SURE HE CAN
 HANDLE HIMSELF.

15:44.574 --> 15:47.317
WELL, HOW ARE YOU GONNA KNOW
 UNLESS SOMETHING HAPPENS?

15:47.317 --> 15:49.219
DUDE, COULD YOU BE LESS
 SUPPORTIVE?

15:49.219 --> 15:50.580
I WAS WATCHING THIS NEWS SHOW,

15:50.580 --> 15:52.682
AND THEY HAD THESE KIDS
 AT A PLAYGROUND.

15:52.682 --> 15:55.455
THIS UNDERCOVER REPORTER CAME
 AND ASKED THEM

15:55.455 --> 15:57.957
IF THEY WANTED TO PLAY
 WITH HIS PUPPY.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.659
EVERY SINGLE KID
 WENT WITH HIM.

15:59.659 --> 16:00.660
EVERY KID?

16:00.660 --> 16:02.332
WELL, ALMOST EVERY KID.

16:02.332 --> 16:04.094
THE REST OF THE KIDS CAME

16:04.094 --> 16:08.298
WHEN THE GUY PROMISED TO TAKE
 THEM TO GO SEE SANTA CLAUS.

16:08.298 --> 16:09.599
OH, MY GOD.

16:09.599 --> 16:10.540
PULL UP TO MAX.

16:10.540 --> 16:11.371
WHAT FOR?

16:11.371 --> 16:13.073
I´M GONNA TEST MY KID.

16:13.073 --> 16:15.975
WHEN YOU GET NEXT TO HIM,
 I´M GONNA TELL YOU WHAT TO SAY.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.748
I WANT TO SEE IF HE´LL GET
 IN A STRANGER´S VAN.

16:18.748 --> 16:21.411
I DON´T KNOW ABOUT THIS,
 GEORGE, REALLY.

16:21.411 --> 16:23.453
YOU WANT TO STAY IN
 THE CAR POOL?

16:23.453 --> 16:25.755
IS IT GONNA BE LIKE THIS
 EVERY MORNING?

16:25.755 --> 16:28.358
THERE HE IS RIGHT THERE.
 GET HIS ATTENTION.

16:28.358 --> 16:30.190
HEY. HEY, THERE, BUDDY.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.722
FRANK, TELL HIM YOU LOST
 YOUR PUPPY.

16:32.722 --> 16:36.166
HEY, YOU SEE MY PUPPY AROUND
 HERE ANYWHERE?

16:36.166 --> 16:37.427
I LOST HIM.

16:37.427 --> 16:39.999
I DON´T KNOW THIS NEIGHBORHOOD
 TOO GOOD.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.431
I HAVEN´T SEEN HIM.

16:41.431 --> 16:44.634
ASK HIM TO GET IN AND HELP YOU
 LOOK FOR THE PUPPY.

16:44.634 --> 16:48.078
HEY, YOU WANT TO HOP IN,
 HELP ME LOOK FOR HIM?

16:48.078 --> 16:49.709
I´LL GIVE YOU
 A COUPLE OF BUCKS.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.211
THAT´S GOOD.

16:51.211 --> 16:54.244
HEY, YOU´VE NEVER DONE
 THIS BEFORE, HAVE YOU?

16:57.047 --> 16:58.748
I´LL HELP YOU LOOK
 FOR THE PUPPY.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.451
MR. LOPEZ?

17:01.451 --> 17:03.623
TIMMY, YOU´RE GONNA RUIN IT.

17:03.623 --> 17:07.156
BUT I WANT TO HELP LOOK
 FOR THE PUPPY.

17:07.156 --> 17:10.630
COME ON.
 JUST GET IN AND BE QUIET.

17:12.662 --> 17:15.435
COME ON, FRANK.
 CATCH UP TO MAX.

17:16.566 --> 17:19.209
HEY, TELL HIM YOU GOT
 AN XBOX IN HERE.

17:19.209 --> 17:21.271
WHERE´S THE XBOX?
 I WANT TO PLAY.

17:21.271 --> 17:22.712
TIMMY, BE QUIET,

17:22.712 --> 17:25.775
AND I´LL GIVE YOU ALL THE CHANGE
 THAT´S IN MY POCKET.

17:25.775 --> 17:28.678
HEY, YOU KNOW, I GOT
 AN XBOX IN HERE.

17:28.678 --> 17:31.581
YOU WANT TO COME IN
 AND PLAY WITH IT?

17:31.581 --> 17:34.284
YOU´RE NOT SAFE!
 YOU´RE NOT SAFE!

17:34.284 --> 17:36.186
HEY, GEORGE, YOUR KID´S
 RUNNING AWAY.

17:36.186 --> 17:37.587
GOOD BOY.
 WAY TO GO, MAX.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.691
UH, WE GOT COMPANY.

17:41.691 --> 17:44.194
GEORGE? IS THAT YOU?

17:44.194 --> 17:46.496
HEY, JIM.
 WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, JIM?

17:46.496 --> 17:48.638
I WAS WALKING MY KID
 TO SCHOOL.

17:48.638 --> 17:50.700
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
 BACK THERE?

17:50.700 --> 17:53.303
HEY, JIM, LISTEN,
 I KNOW THIS LOOKS FUNNY,

17:53.303 --> 17:54.804
BUT I WAS WORRIED ABOUT MAX

17:54.804 --> 17:57.207
WALKING TO SCHOOL
 ALL BY HIMSELF,

17:57.207 --> 17:58.678
SO I THOUGHT MAYBE I´D TEST HIM

17:58.678 --> 18:01.181
TO SEE IF HE´D GET IN A
 STRANGER´S VAN.

18:01.181 --> 18:02.712
BUT TIMMY GOT IN INSTEAD.

18:02.712 --> 18:04.584
TIMMY, IS THAT TRUE?

18:04.584 --> 18:06.786
HE SAID
 IF I KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT,

18:06.786 --> 18:09.419
I CAN HAVE WHAT´S
 IN HIS POCKET.

18:09.419 --> 18:12.122
I´M GONNA NEED TO ASK YOU GUYS
 A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.

18:12.122 --> 18:13.863
GEORGE, I WANT OUT
 OF THE CAR POOL.

18:16.266 --> 18:17.767
FRANK, YOU WERE OUT
 OF THE CAR POOL

18:17.767 --> 18:19.799
THE MINUTE YOU TRICKED TIMMY
 INTO THIS VAN.

18:23.773 --> 18:25.405
I TOLD YOU

18:25.405 --> 18:27.807
I COULD MAKE IT TO SCHOOL
 AND BACK ALL BY MYSELF.

18:27.807 --> 18:28.808
AND NOTHING WENT WRONG!

18:28.808 --> 18:30.480
EXCEPT THERE WAS THIS VAN,

18:30.480 --> 18:33.543
THE DRIVER TRIED TO TALK TO ME,
 BUT I RAN AWAY.

18:33.543 --> 18:34.784
YOU DID GREAT, HONEY.

18:34.784 --> 18:37.717
YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT
 PEOPLE IN VANS

18:37.717 --> 18:40.290
BECAUSE SOME OF THEM
 ARE IDIOTS.

18:43.753 --> 18:47.297
YOU KNOW WHAT, SON?
 I´M REALLY PROUD OF YOU.

18:47.297 --> 18:50.560
YOU´VE PROVEN TO US THAT YOU´RE
 A RESPONSIBLE YOUNG MAN.

18:50.560 --> 18:51.701
THANKS.

18:51.701 --> 18:53.733
OH, CAN I GET
 MY CELLPHONE BACK?

18:53.733 --> 18:55.505
I´LL GET IT BACK TOMORROW.

18:55.505 --> 18:59.409
I LOANED IT TO YOSHI.
 HE MISSES HIS FRIENDS IN JAPAN.

19:01.140 --> 19:05.215
AS FAR AS THE PHONE COMPANY´S
 CONCERNED, YOSHI STOLE IT.

19:05.215 --> 19:08.278
YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU DID
 WAS CRAZY.

19:08.278 --> 19:12.422
MAYBE, BUT AT LEAST MY HEART´S
 IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

19:12.422 --> 19:15.325
GEORGE, I KNOW YOUR HEART´S
 IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

19:15.325 --> 19:17.787
AND YOUR HEAD´S ALMOST FAR
 ENOUGH UP THERE

19:17.787 --> 19:19.359
TO BE RIGHT NEXT TO IT.

19:19.359 --> 19:22.662
I CAN´T HELP BUT WORRY
 ABOUT MAX, ANGIE.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.464
HE´S SUCH A SWEET LITTLE GUY.

19:24.464 --> 19:27.767
BUT, GEORGE, WE HAVE
 TO LET HIM GROW UP.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.669
BUT IT´S HAPPENING SO FAST.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.201
I KNOW.

19:31.201 --> 19:34.644
I MEAN, NOW HE´S WALKING
 HIMSELF TO SCHOOL.

19:34.644 --> 19:37.507
NEXT THING,
 HE´LL BE IN COLLEGE.

19:37.507 --> 19:39.709
HE´LL BE OUT OF OUR LIVES.

19:56.666 --> 19:58.498
WHATCHA DOING THERE, MAX?

19:58.498 --> 20:03.202
IT´S MY NEW INVENTION --
 CEREAL ON A STICK.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.704
CEREAL ON A STICK.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.536
AW, COME HERE, BUDDY.

20:06.536 --> 20:11.411
YOU´RE GONNA WORK IN THE FACTORY
 WITH YOUR DAD, AREN´T YOU?

20:16.416 --> 20:18.748
HEY, GEORGE,
 YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

20:18.748 --> 20:20.350
FRANK DROPPED OUT
 OF THE CAR POOL.
