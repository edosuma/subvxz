WEBVTT

00:09.699 --> 00:11.775
Colonel O'Neill.

00:12.779 --> 00:15.317
What have we got here, Teal'c?

00:15.300 --> 00:16.925
I do not know.

00:18.100 --> 00:19.510
Wow.

00:19.539 --> 00:22.955
<i>It may indicate
a civilisation of some kind.</i>

00:23.141 --> 00:26.344
<i>Well, let's spread out
and take a look.</i>

00:26.301 --> 00:29.422
<i>I think there's
a way down over here.</i>

00:35.462 --> 00:38.034
Crystals. Granite, not volcanic.

00:39.222 --> 00:41.463
I don't see any that aren't broken.

00:42.860 --> 00:45.433
These pieces might fit together.

00:47.942 --> 00:50.018
There's a whole one.

00:51.262 --> 00:54.679
Looks like they've been
blasted apart by something.

00:55.383 --> 00:57.459
<i>It's damaged.</i>

00:58.143 --> 01:00.978
I don't see any other whole ones, do you?

01:05.623 --> 01:07.698
<i>Teal'c.</i>

02:00.227 --> 02:02.100
Argh!

02:29.509 --> 02:31.585
Where's the colonel?

02:33.710 --> 02:37.623
<i>Jack, we've finished
our recon. We're ready to head back.</i>

02:37.550 --> 02:40.218
<i>Is this... Am I using this right?</i>

02:44.430 --> 02:47.098
Ready to head out, sir!

02:54.031 --> 02:56.189
<i>Colonel!</i>

03:16.032 --> 03:21.240
<i>Welcome back, SG-1.
Debriefing will commence at 0900.</i>

04:34.117 --> 04:36.442
The samples we brought
are being analysed.

04:36.437 --> 04:41.858
And we explored around the gate without
finding any sign of recent Goa'uld mining.

04:41.718 --> 04:46.759
There was no indication that Goa'ulds had
been through that gate in 1,000 years.

04:46.637 --> 04:50.682
- Tell me about these crystals.
- We found thousands near the Stargate.

04:50.598 --> 04:55.011
Since we didn't find them elsewhere on
the planet, it's likely they were put there.

04:54.918 --> 04:57.754
<i>- Why?
- Early Greek cultures valued crystal.</i>

04:57.720 --> 05:01.966
Perhaps the pit has some religious
or ceremonial significance.

05:02.918 --> 05:05.540
<i>Your report
doesn't mention population.</i>

05:05.519 --> 05:08.935
There's no evidence
of a developed culture, nothing.

05:08.879 --> 05:12.213
I'm with Daniel. We didn't
find any unbroken crystals,

05:12.160 --> 05:16.156
but we have this one and pieces
of a few larger ones back in decon.

05:16.081 --> 05:17.788
Flag this one, Colonel.

05:17.800 --> 05:23.007
SG-1 is on stand-down until your
next mission comes up. Dismissed.

06:26.324 --> 06:27.985
Yeah!

06:34.125 --> 06:36.201
Hey, Colonel.

06:42.326 --> 06:46.702
Listen, no offence, Colonel, but this
becomes the women's locker room in...

06:46.605 --> 06:48.848
Well, now.

06:48.846 --> 06:51.762
You know how I hate those sandy planets.

06:53.048 --> 06:55.456
You don't have to hurry on my account.

06:58.007 --> 07:00.961
Nice. You have a family.

07:03.127 --> 07:04.670
Yes.

07:04.687 --> 07:09.350
I'm an auntie, myself. My brother moved
to San Diego, so I don't see him much.

07:09.247 --> 07:12.865
He has two kids now, a boy and a girl.
I miss 'em like hell.

07:12.807 --> 07:15.379
I don't get there near enough.

07:16.928 --> 07:19.798
I can see you feel the same way.

07:19.769 --> 07:21.809
Goodbye, Sam.

07:21.807 --> 07:23.682
Bye.

07:25.408 --> 07:28.326
- Jack seems very focused.
- Yeah.

07:29.608 --> 07:33.558
He was looking at pictures of his family.
He must be in a hurry to get home.

07:33.488 --> 07:36.442
- I didn't even know he was married.
- Oh, he isn't.

07:37.889 --> 07:42.766
Um, he was, but they separated
after his son... died.

07:56.971 --> 08:00.303
Colonel O'Neill, you are departing?

08:00.250 --> 08:01.115
Yes.

08:01.170 --> 08:05.216
You said one day you would show me
your world. I would like to see it now.

08:05.130 --> 08:07.206
Another time.

08:14.451 --> 08:18.319
I've known him for months, and
he doesn't mention a life outside here,

08:18.252 --> 08:21.952
and I'm thinking he just doesn't have one.
What else don't I know?

08:21.893 --> 08:25.012
He doesn't really tell you much
until he gets to know you.

08:24.973 --> 08:27.545
Yeah, that's an understatement.

08:29.572 --> 08:32.062
All right, what do we have here?

08:32.052 --> 08:34.294
Passed the decontamination protocols.

08:34.293 --> 08:38.456
I noticed it's got a low-level
EM field you should check out.

08:38.374 --> 08:41.245
Either that or my fridge magnets
fell off by themselves.

08:41.212 --> 08:44.996
- I'm sorry. EM?
- Electromagnetic energy. Thanks.

08:49.053 --> 08:53.217
So, tell me more about the colonel.
What happened to his son?

08:55.495 --> 09:00.157
Charlie... accidentally killed himself
with Jack's personal gun.

09:00.056 --> 09:02.095
Oh, God. That's horrible.

09:02.095 --> 09:06.886
Jack never forgave himself. He holed up
and turned his back on the world for...

09:06.775 --> 09:09.183
- A long time.
- Yeah, I can imagine.

09:09.176 --> 09:13.636
I don't know what I'd do.
What about his wife?

09:13.775 --> 09:16.528
Sara? I don't think they've met
since he joined SG-1.

09:16.495 --> 09:19.068
He hasn't said anything but, like I said...

09:19.056 --> 09:21.629
He doesn't tell you much. Right.

09:22.177 --> 09:26.553
Look at this. See the edge of this crystal,
how it's glassy, like it's been melted?

09:26.456 --> 09:28.615
Can you tell what did it?

09:28.616 --> 09:33.693
It may shed light on what the significance
of the pit was and who put them there.

09:33.577 --> 09:36.033
It takes extreme temperatures
to melt quartz.

09:36.018 --> 09:39.966
- Lightning?
- Maybe. But it's too precise, too clean.

09:42.298 --> 09:46.378
I think I've seen a cut like this before.
Here, in this facility.

09:52.859 --> 09:55.979
<i>Dad, I left some
iced tea in there for you.</i>

09:58.859 --> 10:01.350
<i>Hello, Sara.</i>

10:03.058 --> 10:05.549
<i>Hello, Sara.</i>

10:08.100 --> 10:12.846
May be time to face facts, Dad.
This old thing has seen better days.

10:12.740 --> 10:16.274
You shouldn't be so quick to give up
on the aged. Makes a father worry.

10:16.221 --> 10:18.889
C'mon, Dad, I'm serious. If I keep...

10:20.379 --> 10:22.336
Hello, Sara.

10:23.221 --> 10:25.841
- Been there long?
- Yes.

10:25.821 --> 10:28.774
- Could've said something.
- I did.

10:30.659 --> 10:32.735
Right. You did.

10:42.020 --> 10:45.389
- Is something wrong?
- I think it's the ignition.

10:46.621 --> 10:49.871
But you didn't come about the car.

10:49.822 --> 10:51.614
No.

10:51.620 --> 10:55.240
So what, you decided
you'd just... show up?

10:55.182 --> 10:57.673
Waltz back into my life? Is that it?

10:59.423 --> 11:01.297
Yes.

11:03.943 --> 11:06.860
I need to find Charlie. Is he here?

11:07.703 --> 11:10.076
Charlie?

11:11.464 --> 11:14.500
I need Charlie.
That's his bicycle, isn't it?

11:15.943 --> 11:19.894
- I kept some of his things.
- Yes, I know.

11:19.823 --> 11:22.825
Jack, what are you doing?
You're scaring me.

11:22.784 --> 11:25.537
It's important, Sara.

11:25.745 --> 11:28.033
- Charlie!
- Don't! Let go of me.

11:28.024 --> 11:31.975
What is wrong with you? Is this
your idea of a joke? Get away from me.

11:31.904 --> 11:33.813
Sara.

11:36.345 --> 11:38.421
You don't understand.

11:46.826 --> 11:51.738
Son, if upsetting her is your way of trying
to win a woman's heart, it's a stupid one.

11:51.626 --> 11:54.663
- Anyone ever tell you that?
- I think you just did.

11:57.907 --> 11:59.982
Come on in.

12:08.226 --> 12:13.303
<i>Attention. All new personnel
report to auditorium, sub-level one,</i>

12:13.188 --> 12:16.639
<i>for orientation at 1430 hours.</i>

12:25.668 --> 12:29.879
<i>After last night's rally turned
ugly and protesters clashed with police,</i>

12:29.788 --> 12:33.158
<i>police have announced that
a dusk-to-dawn curfew is in effect.</i>

12:33.110 --> 12:35.019
<i>No word yet on any casualties.</i>

12:35.030 --> 12:40.321
<i>In finance, the bull was annihilated
today, with bears leaving a sea of red.</i>

12:52.030 --> 12:57.321
<i>.. for the third straight day. No
one on either side can say how it started.</i>

13:01.072 --> 13:03.443
Teal'c, we need your help.

13:03.431 --> 13:07.049
- Your world is a strange place.
- So's yours.

13:06.990 --> 13:09.826
Listen, we need
to sign out your staff weapon.

13:09.792 --> 13:13.077
- Are we being deployed?
- No, no. It's OK. C'mon.

13:22.672 --> 13:26.836
Parents shouldn't outlive their children.
It isn't natural.

13:34.913 --> 13:36.705
He loved to laugh.

13:36.712 --> 13:40.960
Yeah. Sometimes, I can still hear him
laughin' at one of my bad jokes.

13:41.832 --> 13:46.080
Sara kept all of his things,
like that bike outside.

13:45.994 --> 13:48.947
I guess it's her way of
keepin' him around awhile.

13:50.595 --> 13:52.753
I thought I would find Charlie here.

13:53.674 --> 13:56.794
- Look around, you still might.
- He's gone.

13:59.034 --> 14:01.110
What do I do?

14:02.595 --> 14:06.344
Sara comes up here and talks
to him sometimes, and it helps her.

14:06.274 --> 14:08.945
If it helps you, I'm glad you're here.

14:25.277 --> 14:29.524
For an Irishman, you never were
much of a talker, but that never mattered.

14:29.436 --> 14:32.556
I'll give you that much.
You married my daughter.

14:40.197 --> 14:44.693
Say what you need to Charlie, if that's all
you came for, but Sara isn't over you yet.

14:44.597 --> 14:49.591
So you break her heart again and, God
help me, I'll make you wish you never did.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.259
All right!

15:43.681 --> 15:46.599
- How was your day?
- Fine.

15:47.282 --> 15:50.567
Oh, look what came home
from school today.

15:52.643 --> 15:54.433
Is Charlie about ready?

15:54.442 --> 15:57.063
Yeah. He was running around
a few minutes ago.

16:04.163 --> 16:05.705
Charlie!

16:34.565 --> 16:36.640
Here's a good one.

16:40.527 --> 16:42.150
<i>What's going on?</i>

16:42.165 --> 16:46.328
You received permission for me
to fire my staff weapon in the gate room?

16:46.246 --> 16:48.322
- Oh, yeah.
- Absolutely.

16:50.605 --> 16:53.476
I noticed that the edge
where the crystal was melted

16:53.446 --> 16:58.154
looked like the walls of the gate room
after Apophis's guards shot up the place.

16:58.047 --> 17:02.792
Take a look at this. We did a complete
study trying to figure out what they used.

17:02.687 --> 17:04.930
We kept a few pieces
and that gave me the idea.

17:04.928 --> 17:10.218
Your weapon is the same as Apophis's,
so we can compare the blast marks.

17:10.087 --> 17:12.413
I'm telling the computer to build a model.

17:12.406 --> 17:15.443
We should see if the energy
signatures are the same or not.

17:28.930 --> 17:32.973
- Matches up.
- Goa'uld weapons destroyed the crystals.

17:32.888 --> 17:36.507
Yeah. I'd say a whole mess
of the staff weapons did it.

17:45.009 --> 17:49.008
We haven't talked about Charlie
since he died. Why now?

17:48.930 --> 17:50.804
What were you doing up there?

17:50.809 --> 17:55.222
Do you remember how much fun
Charlie used to have playing that... game?

17:55.891 --> 17:57.967
- Baseball?
- Baseball.

18:00.250 --> 18:04.913
- He loved that game.
- He loved playing, with you.

18:07.371 --> 18:09.163
Jack?

18:12.652 --> 18:15.736
- I have to get back to the Stargate.
- Back to what?

18:15.692 --> 18:17.565
Stargate.

18:21.692 --> 18:23.567
It's a...

18:24.452 --> 18:28.532
big... round metal... object.

18:28.452 --> 18:31.074
A ring... of energy.

18:31.491 --> 18:34.907
You always could spin
a line of bull to avoid talkin' to me.

18:44.933 --> 18:46.807
What's wrong?

18:48.734 --> 18:52.317
I've been crying. That's what's wrong.
What's with you?

18:53.775 --> 18:57.108
Upstairs. I've never
seen you like that before.

18:57.055 --> 18:59.627
For a second, I thought
you were gonna cry.

19:00.535 --> 19:03.701
Where's all that O'Neill military bravado?

19:04.976 --> 19:07.467
I don't think I have it.

19:15.376 --> 19:17.583
- What?
- Smoke.

19:17.576 --> 19:20.412
Oh, my God! Mike left
a casserole in for me.

19:21.136 --> 19:25.217
<i>The energy signature looks
like some kind of gas plasma laser.</i>

19:25.135 --> 19:28.755
I'd love to get this into
the spectrometer at Stanford.

19:28.696 --> 19:31.449
What is a Stanford?

19:31.417 --> 19:34.868
D'you see this thing inside?
I didn't think that was there before.

19:37.417 --> 19:39.707
Whoa! Captain Carter, Teal'c!

19:39.697 --> 19:41.570
Yeah?

19:43.577 --> 19:45.903
It was... me.

19:48.057 --> 19:49.967
It was me.

19:49.978 --> 19:53.596
- Are you OK?
- Just... look.

19:57.819 --> 20:00.144
- My reflection. So?
- Closer.

20:04.059 --> 20:06.051
Holy Hannah!

20:10.539 --> 20:12.663
Help us.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.972
Oh, my God!

20:22.500 --> 20:24.624
Why is it spinning up? No one's due back.

20:25.621 --> 20:29.203
It was trying to communicate with us.

20:29.141 --> 20:31.346
I don't know the magic password.
Do you?

20:31.342 --> 20:34.461
<i>It's the gate. Incoming.</i>

20:34.421 --> 20:37.090
<i>Offworld activation.
This is not a drill.</i>

20:37.061 --> 20:39.848
- I didn't think anyone was due back.
- No one is.

20:39.822 --> 20:42.442
<i>Offworld activation. This is not a drill.</i>

20:42.902 --> 20:46.685
<i>All units, report to stations.
This is not a drill.</i>

20:58.103 --> 21:00.344
- Where's the iris?
- Someone used the remote.

21:00.343 --> 21:03.546
- Who? We're all here.
- Whoever it is has our codes.

21:03.502 --> 21:05.911
Heads up, people.

21:12.744 --> 21:15.200
What are you doin', leavin' without me?

21:23.984 --> 21:26.107
What's with all the ordnance?

21:26.104 --> 21:28.180
Who are you?

21:28.944 --> 21:31.435
What do you mean, who am I?

21:33.505 --> 21:37.336
- What the heck's goin' on here?
- Good question. Take him into custody.

21:45.267 --> 21:47.935
<i>C'mon, get me outta here!</i>

21:49.226 --> 21:52.510
<i>Tell you what, let me put it nicely.</i>

21:52.787 --> 21:54.863
<i>Get me the hell outta here!</i>

21:55.987 --> 21:59.902
If that isn't O'Neill, I wanna know
who the hell we're looking at.

21:59.826 --> 22:02.531
We're searchin' the facility now, sir.

22:17.147 --> 22:20.433
I'm waiting for you to say... "I'm sorry",

22:20.390 --> 22:23.593
or... "I wanna get back together",

22:23.549 --> 22:27.796
or just whatever's on your mind.
Anything. Just talk to me.

22:32.788 --> 22:35.660
The first time we were together,
is this where we came?

22:39.348 --> 22:43.133
- You're angry.
- Angry? At you? No, I'm not angry.

22:43.868 --> 22:45.742
Good.

22:46.671 --> 22:48.876
- You were.
- When?

22:48.871 --> 22:50.947
When Charlie died.

22:51.951 --> 22:54.240
It's why I left.

22:57.111 --> 22:59.648
You son of a bitch.

22:59.630 --> 23:03.876
You walked out on me back then
because you thought I was mad at you?

23:03.790 --> 23:06.744
- You tryin' to tell me it's my fault?
- No.

23:07.112 --> 23:10.278
Why didn't you talk to me?
Why didn't you ask?

23:10.231 --> 23:13.232
I should have... but I didn't.

23:14.511 --> 23:17.383
- So you were angry.
- No.

23:20.511 --> 23:22.385
Yes.

23:22.913 --> 23:27.207
What did you expect?
It happened in our house.

23:27.112 --> 23:29.068
It was your gun.

23:32.951 --> 23:35.526
I know you blamed yourself.

23:36.234 --> 23:41.109
But if you'd just opened up for once
and let me through that armour of yours...

23:42.115 --> 23:44.784
we could have helped each other.

23:46.193 --> 23:48.269
I needed you.

23:49.115 --> 23:51.355
I know.

23:51.354 --> 23:53.430
You know?

23:54.035 --> 23:58.826
And you can say it,
just like that... after all this time?

23:58.875 --> 24:02.243
I'm sorry it took so long.
It should have been said sooner.

24:02.955 --> 24:05.446
Is that what you came to tell me?

24:05.435 --> 24:09.516
There's no way to make you
understand what I came here to do.

24:09.435 --> 24:12.188
- You couldn't understand.
- Try me.

24:15.556 --> 24:18.557
If I could bring Charlie
back through the Stargate...

24:18.516 --> 24:23.095
Shut up about that, would you?!
Charlie is gone, Jack.

24:25.477 --> 24:28.928
We should be talking about us
and what happened, and not...

24:31.196 --> 24:32.477
Jack?

24:32.518 --> 24:34.392
My God!

24:42.038 --> 24:45.489
Jack? Jack, what is that?

24:45.438 --> 24:47.929
What's happened to you?

24:48.439 --> 24:50.846
We gotta get you to the hospital.

24:56.679 --> 24:58.552
The MRI was negative.

24:58.557 --> 25:03.184
The DNA screen matches
what we have on file.

25:03.078 --> 25:07.326
Physical examination shows some
trauma. Otherwise he seems healthy.

25:07.239 --> 25:11.451
- "Healthy" doesn't cut it.
- The evidence says he's Jack O'Neill.

25:11.361 --> 25:14.528
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Then how do you explain the other one?

25:14.480 --> 25:16.556
What other one?

25:17.961 --> 25:19.039
What?

25:25.361 --> 25:29.571
OK, so that's not possible.
I didn't come back with you guys.

25:34.040 --> 25:37.374
<i>- What is that?
- The EM energy in the one intact crystal</i>

25:37.323 --> 25:40.277
we brought back from P3X-562
may hold the key to this.

25:40.241 --> 25:41.785
Explain.

25:41.801 --> 25:45.550
The electromagnetic energy
in the crystal is able to mimic things.

25:45.481 --> 25:50.273
It recreated Daniel and I, cloned us
electronically. At least, part of us.

25:50.162 --> 25:53.281
It seemed to read our thoughts
and speech, and mimic them, too.

25:53.242 --> 25:58.117
What if the other O'Neill is energy like
the thing Daniel and I found in the crystal,

25:58.002 --> 26:01.038
only a more powerful,
more evolved form of it?

26:01.003 --> 26:04.420
One powerful enough to copy
a whole person, not just faces.

26:04.364 --> 26:07.731
- Is that what we're looking at?
- Could be.

26:07.683 --> 26:11.598
- And it tried to communicate with you?
- It asked for our help.

26:13.443 --> 26:15.934
This may not work.

26:19.044 --> 26:20.420
Hello?

26:25.046 --> 26:27.038
Hello.

26:31.165 --> 26:34.616
- What are you?
- Energy, unity.

26:34.565 --> 26:38.099
- You would describe me thus.
- You asked for help.

26:38.326 --> 26:42.903
If I remain here, my energy
will disintegrate. I must return.

26:43.086 --> 26:45.209
Why did you not speak before?

26:45.205 --> 26:47.412
- Fear.
- Fear of what?

26:47.405 --> 26:50.739
The Goa'uld came to our planet long ago.

26:50.686 --> 26:53.890
We were not afraid then
and we tried to greet them.

26:53.847 --> 26:58.010
One of them touched us as you did
and was destroyed by our energy.

26:58.127 --> 27:01.626
Well, that's some kind
of welcome wagon you got there.

27:03.847 --> 27:05.971
It almost killed me.

27:07.167 --> 27:09.290
The Goa'ulds must have been exploring.

27:09.288 --> 27:11.695
That's why it was afraid.
We look like them.

27:11.688 --> 27:16.682
- One of the Goa'ulds was killed?
- They gathered all the unity and ended it.

27:17.208 --> 27:19.330
We confirmed Goa'uld weapons did it.

27:19.328 --> 27:24.453
Then that pit wasn't a ceremonial place
at all. It was some kind of... mass grave.

27:26.449 --> 27:29.366
I can no longer sustain this form.

27:39.490 --> 27:41.566
What was that?

27:42.691 --> 27:47.186
Any ideas, any theories, explanations?

27:49.769 --> 27:50.800
Anything?

27:50.851 --> 27:54.931
If you thought that your entire race
was destroyed by the Goa'ulds

27:54.851 --> 27:59.180
for harming one of them, what would you
do if you thought it would happen again?

28:09.092 --> 28:12.508
Sir, O'Neill - the other guy -
is nowhere in the mountain.

28:17.212 --> 28:21.079
OK, we got a problem. I ran
some tests on the crystals in the lab.

28:21.251 --> 28:26.079
Whatever the energy in the crystal is, it's
decaying. It's ionising particle radiation.

28:25.972 --> 28:29.757
- Nuclear radiation?
- The amounts are not dangerous,

28:29.693 --> 28:34.190
but if "O'Neill" - it - starts breaking down
like the energy in the crystals

28:34.093 --> 28:36.417
and it's more powerful
than what we have,

28:36.413 --> 28:39.201
then anyone nearby
could get a lethal dose.

28:39.173 --> 28:43.218
If that's true, we have a very serious
problem. Let's hope it's not.

28:43.134 --> 28:46.003
Something else.
I've thought about where it went.

28:45.973 --> 28:51.181
Sir, it was in your locker, looking at your
personal stuff - pictures of your family.

28:59.215 --> 29:01.920
<i>C'mon, Sara. C'mon.</i>

29:02.174 --> 29:04.796
<i>I can't take your call,
so leave a message.</i>

29:05.575 --> 29:07.651
I gotta get there.

29:11.375 --> 29:15.421
I'm pretty sure it's breaking down
because Earth's electromagnetic field

29:15.336 --> 29:19.749
is stronger than the one on P3X-562.
The difference is tearing it apart.

29:19.656 --> 29:21.280
- Can we stop it?
- I don't know.

29:21.297 --> 29:23.502
No one's at your wife's house.

29:23.497 --> 29:26.663
A local hospital admitted
a J O'Neill less than an hour ago.

29:26.616 --> 29:29.986
- Teal'c, leave that here.
- I have seen your world. I will need it.

29:29.936 --> 29:32.427
Can't let you take your weapon, Teal'c.

29:33.458 --> 29:37.622
You, all of you, will be operating in public,
so you can't do or say anything

29:37.537 --> 29:41.154
that reveals the existence
of the SGC or the Stargate.

29:42.979 --> 29:47.723
Chicago, the Windy City. Home of the
Blackhawks, the Bulls and the White Sox.

29:48.058 --> 29:51.842
<i>- Don't forget the Cubs.
- Heads up, Colonel.</i>

29:52.578 --> 29:54.654
Good luck.

30:17.138 --> 30:19.012
Charlie.

30:24.859 --> 30:27.778
- This is the place we brought him.
- Yes, it is.

30:35.222 --> 30:37.381
He died here.

30:37.382 --> 30:39.458
Yes, he did.

30:40.382 --> 30:43.299
Jack, what's happening to you?

30:43.261 --> 30:46.511
I have to get to the Stargate.
Can we do that?

30:47.862 --> 30:50.400
Jack, I know you wanna
get to the Stargate...

31:19.545 --> 31:22.166
All right, people, I need buses up here.

31:24.825 --> 31:28.442
I want these people outta here now!
Come on, move, move!

31:30.984 --> 31:35.231
As soon as Colonel O'Neill's team gives
the signal, shut the power down inside.

31:35.145 --> 31:37.221
- All right?
- All right.

31:43.626 --> 31:46.332
Thanks. Go. I'm all right. Go.

31:46.307 --> 31:49.510
<i>- I'm almost finished.
- Everybody out!</i>

31:49.467 --> 31:52.384
I need everybody
outta here now! Let's go!

31:56.267 --> 31:59.351
- Jack?!
- Sara! Are you all right?

32:00.826 --> 32:03.317
Honey, listen. This is me, baby.

32:07.509 --> 32:09.002
Jack!

32:09.028 --> 32:10.736
- You all right?
- Yeah.

32:10.748 --> 32:14.082
OK. I wanna hear all about it,
but not now. Are you OK?

32:14.228 --> 32:15.638
Yeah.

32:15.667 --> 32:18.124
- What room?
- 33.

32:18.107 --> 32:19.852
Colonel!

32:24.509 --> 32:26.585
It's OK.

33:07.510 --> 33:11.259
<i>Listen, Colonel.
It's buried in the red.</i>

33:11.751 --> 33:14.705
<i>- How's the power?
- Turned off as much as possible.</i>

33:14.672 --> 33:17.244
They've shut down all they can.

33:31.313 --> 33:33.471
<i>It's all right.</i>

33:35.873 --> 33:38.199
I'm not gonna hurt you.

33:38.913 --> 33:40.787
Please...

33:41.594 --> 33:43.670
stay back.

33:45.714 --> 33:49.333
I do not want to harm you...

33:50.634 --> 33:52.509
again.

33:53.556 --> 33:58.549
My... energy... is... about... to...

34:16.235 --> 34:19.688
<i>- Radiation's down.
- O'Neill, are you all right?</i>

34:19.637 --> 34:21.380
I'm OK.

34:22.516 --> 34:26.681
<i>- What's happening?
- We got 20% emergency power.</i>

34:26.597 --> 34:30.215
<i>Radiation's low enough.
We should be all right.</i>

34:40.077 --> 34:42.284
You have come to destroy me.

34:44.038 --> 34:45.746
No.

34:46.759 --> 34:48.835
That's not true.

34:54.717 --> 34:58.335
I know you weren't trying
to kill me back on the planet.

35:07.199 --> 35:11.447
The Goa'ulds, the people
who destroyed your race,

35:12.400 --> 35:14.891
they're our enemies, too.

35:17.880 --> 35:19.956
I understand.

35:21.442 --> 35:23.150
Thank you.

35:24.081 --> 35:26.572
Why did you come here?

35:29.121 --> 35:31.826
<i>When my energy hurt you,</i>

35:31.800 --> 35:34.291
<i>I tried to heal you.</i>

35:35.442 --> 35:38.893
<i>But I did not understand your injury.</i>

35:40.681 --> 35:44.300
<i>So I looked into your mind.</i>

35:47.041 --> 35:50.291
I saw the mind of a warrior.

35:52.443 --> 35:54.565
I feared it,

35:54.563 --> 35:58.394
as I feared those who destroyed my race.

36:00.603 --> 36:03.521
<i>I tried to make you well,</i>

36:03.483 --> 36:06.400
<i>before my mistake was discovered,</i>

36:06.362 --> 36:08.735
<i>before the others returned...</i>

36:09.083 --> 36:11.159
to destroy me.

36:13.083 --> 36:15.409
I understand now.

36:16.684 --> 36:22.804
Your deepest pain was not
the physical injury I had caused.

36:24.125 --> 36:29.083
Your pain was from
an empty place in your heart

36:28.963 --> 36:31.289
where Charlie once was.

36:35.806 --> 36:40.800
I thought if I could bring Charlie
to you, it would make you well.

36:40.686 --> 36:44.684
I did not understand his death meant

36:44.606 --> 36:47.974
he could no longer exist
as flesh and blood.

36:48.646 --> 36:51.101
Physical death

36:51.085 --> 36:56.246
does not have the same meaning... to us.

36:57.166 --> 36:59.739
Are you dying now?

37:01.126 --> 37:03.250
Yes.

37:06.967 --> 37:10.467
I could not bring Charlie to you.

37:10.608 --> 37:13.360
- Charlie's gone.
- No.

37:15.768 --> 37:17.677
He's in here.

37:27.009 --> 37:28.420
Charlie?

37:36.809 --> 37:39.478
You cannot change
what happened that day,

37:39.449 --> 37:43.494
just as I cannot change the day
that the Goa'uld destroyed my world.

37:46.690 --> 37:50.853
I am showing you what of Charlie
is still there, inside you.

37:58.690 --> 38:00.766
<i>Jack?</i>

38:04.132 --> 38:06.289
Jack.

38:07.811 --> 38:11.429
Radiation's still low,
but I don't know for how long.

38:12.291 --> 38:14.534
We have to go.

38:16.652 --> 38:19.688
Is Sara O'Neill still here?

38:20.853 --> 38:22.762
Yes.

38:41.054 --> 38:43.806
<i>- Chopper's inbound.
- You guys go ahead.</i>

38:48.494 --> 38:50.985
<i>Sara.</i>

38:52.574 --> 38:54.650
Oh, my God.

38:55.773 --> 38:57.849
It's not Charlie.

38:59.855 --> 39:01.728
Sara...

39:27.697 --> 39:29.570
Sara...

39:32.097 --> 39:36.260
- I have to get him back.
- To the Stargate.

39:37.057 --> 39:38.931
Yeah.

39:44.259 --> 39:47.128
<i>Whatever that is.</i>

39:48.737 --> 39:50.362
The other guy...

39:54.219 --> 39:56.887
you know what he said?

39:56.860 --> 39:58.817
I've a pretty fair idea.

40:01.179 --> 40:04.298
We were pretty great together,
weren't we?

40:05.659 --> 40:08.150
We were the greatest.

40:32.061 --> 40:34.634
Take care of yourself, Jack.

40:50.503 --> 40:53.373
Keep the lights on. I'll be back.
