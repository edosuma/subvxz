03:11.233 --> 03:13.986
Doctor, I feel I have to tell you that

03:15.278 --> 03:17.326
this has to be my last session with you.

03:19.241 --> 03:20.709
I got fired yesterday.

03:22.619 --> 03:23.836
Look, what's the use?

03:24.996 --> 03:26.919
I can't afford this sort of thing anymore.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.884
Mr. Harris, do you really believe
I'd stop seeing you now,

03:30.001 --> 03:32.971
at a time like this,
just because you couldn't afford it?

03:36.800 --> 03:39.200
I think it's something we should
go into in the next session.

03:42.556 --> 03:43.603
Sure thing.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.275
- Next Thursday at 4:00, right?
- Right.

04:02.826 --> 04:04.328
Dr. Rice, this is Nick Dine.

04:04.453 --> 04:06.421
I can't make my 11:00 session tomorrow.

04:06.538 --> 04:07.835
I'll see you next week.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.711
Hi, Sam, it's Sarah here.

04:11.835 --> 04:14.930
I'm just calling to let you know
that the divorce is final.

04:15.505 --> 04:17.473
I hope you like your new apartment.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.093
If there's anything you need...

04:33.899 --> 04:35.742
And hit a grand slam homerun

04:35.859 --> 04:38.679
- that has Red Sox on top ﬁve...
- No.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.180
We're in the ninth inning now,

04:40.280 --> 04:44.726
the Yankees do have to face the ball with
two men out, in the bat of Bucky Dent.

04:44.826 --> 04:48.021
Bucky with three hits
in the ball game, two to null,

04:48.121 --> 04:50.232
has a chance to be another hero.

04:50.332 --> 04:51.754
He is the ﬁrst pitch to hit a...

04:55.879 --> 04:57.906
Rick Ferrell is kicking hard
with his right.

04:58.006 --> 05:02.077
He leaps, grabs the ball, he grabs on
to the ball, fall onto the ground, and...

05:02.177 --> 05:04.771
Well, Bucky, it's not the '78 playoffs.

05:04.888 --> 05:06.957
Wow, what a catch by Rick Ferrell,

05:07.057 --> 05:09.731
which will take a sure victory
away from the Yankees.

05:10.268 --> 05:11.485
Dr. Rice?

05:13.230 --> 05:16.109
My name is Brooke Reynolds.
I was a friend of George Bynum.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.902
I was wondering if could talk to you
for a moment.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.246
I promise I won't take much time.

05:24.115 --> 05:25.412
Certainly.

05:25.659 --> 05:26.706
Come in.

05:32.457 --> 05:33.583
Sit down.

05:38.964 --> 05:40.591
I was sorry to hear about George.

05:40.715 --> 05:44.390
- When something like this happens...
- Dr. Rice, George left this in my apartment.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.355
And before I could return it to him,

05:47.472 --> 05:50.316
I heard that he had been...
That he was dead.

05:52.978 --> 05:54.588
I...

05:54.688 --> 05:56.048
I thought his wife should have it.

05:56.898 --> 05:57.966
I don't know her.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.660
I mean, I've met her once or twice, but...

06:03.905 --> 06:07.496
What I'm trying to say is, I don't think
she knows anything about George and me.

06:08.577 --> 06:11.421
And I don't see any reason
why she should be hurt by this now.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.005
I thought if...

06:16.668 --> 06:21.469
If you could return it to her
and not mention anything about me.

06:23.049 --> 06:27.937
I thought you could say that,
he left it here in, in your office,

06:28.555 --> 06:30.273
the last time he was here or...

06:33.143 --> 06:35.817
Wouldn't it have been simpler
if you had just mailed it to her?

06:46.323 --> 06:47.666
Do you wanna talk about this?

06:51.411 --> 06:53.379
Yes, yes. I need someone...

06:58.043 --> 06:59.169
Excuse me.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.822
- Yes?
- Dr. Rice,

07:01.922 --> 07:04.866
I tried to call you this morning,
but there wasn't any answer.

07:04.966 --> 07:07.786
I'm Detective Joseph Vitucci,
Homicide Central.

07:07.886 --> 07:08.933
I wonder...

07:10.096 --> 07:12.082
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

07:12.182 --> 07:13.274
Can I pay you?

07:15.685 --> 07:16.878
So stupid of me.

07:16.978 --> 07:18.738
Could you step
into the waiting room, please?

07:19.356 --> 07:20.573
I'll be with you in a moment.

07:23.151 --> 07:26.576
Here. Why don't you use this door.
No one will see you leave.

07:27.364 --> 07:28.536
I've got it.

07:29.783 --> 07:30.784
Miss Reynolds.

07:31.576 --> 07:32.623
Thank you.

07:44.506 --> 07:45.723
Okay.

07:46.883 --> 07:49.432
Dr. Rice. Joseph Vitucci.

07:49.552 --> 07:51.680
Detective First Class, Homicide Central.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.433
- How do you do?
- I appreciate your taking the time.

07:54.557 --> 07:55.750
It's all right.

07:55.850 --> 07:56.897
Sit down.

08:03.608 --> 08:06.111
- You're a psychologist, huh?
- Psychiatrist.

08:06.987 --> 08:10.867
All right, I-A-T-R-I-S-T.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.459
- That's right.
- Okay.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.625
And George Bynum was your patient, huh?

08:15.745 --> 08:16.917
Yes.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.298
Now, how long have you been treating him?

08:23.169 --> 08:24.921
Twice a week for two years.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.306
And last time you saw him?

08:33.847 --> 08:36.316
Thursday, the 22nd, 5:30.

08:38.183 --> 08:39.184
Do you mind?

08:56.703 --> 08:59.773
Okay. Now, anything happened,
like, you know, threats,

08:59.873 --> 09:02.567
attempts on his life,
anything that he mentioned, you know?

09:02.667 --> 09:03.714
No.

09:04.753 --> 09:07.131
Okay, how about anybody
he was having trouble with?

09:08.506 --> 09:09.598
Nothing.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.082
What exactly was it that
you were treating the deceased for?

09:17.182 --> 09:19.480
I'm sorry,
that's confidential information.

09:20.894 --> 09:21.895
Okay.

09:23.313 --> 09:26.132
But if you think of anything
that's not confidential,

09:26.232 --> 09:28.405
I would appreciate it
if you would give me a call.

09:29.152 --> 09:30.324
Sure.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.724
Listen, Dr. Rice. If I were you,
I'd be careful for a little while.

09:34.824 --> 09:38.666
What I mean is if I thought you knew
something about George Bynum's death,

09:39.287 --> 09:41.255
the guy that killed him
might get the same idea.

09:47.504 --> 09:51.099
First session with George Bynum.

09:51.216 --> 09:55.517
Referred by Jack Berger, 47,
married, good health,

09:55.637 --> 09:57.890
works at Crispins, the auction gallery.

09:58.431 --> 10:01.856
He said the pre-Columbian statue
on my desk was a cheap copy.

10:01.976 --> 10:04.149
Told me I watered the plants too much.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.819
Finally admitted he was
having trouble sleeping.

10:07.524 --> 10:09.902
I'm afraid I've really done it this time.

10:13.571 --> 10:15.118
My assistant quit.

10:16.366 --> 10:21.623
And I'd promised the job
to a girl who works with me.

10:22.205 --> 10:26.381
I mean, we'd been having a... You know?

10:28.253 --> 10:30.802
Well, anyway, yesterday afternoon,

10:30.922 --> 10:33.596
this woman came walking into my office.

10:34.092 --> 10:35.560
I don't know why, but...

10:35.844 --> 10:38.939
before I knew what was happening,
I'd offered her the job.

10:40.390 --> 10:44.190
Her name's Brooke Reynolds.
She is very shy, very subdued.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.948
I really am in a lot of trouble.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.240
March 22nd.

10:53.695 --> 10:56.039
Crispins is handling the Maddow estate.

10:56.531 --> 10:58.579
He's a big collector of antiquities.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.333
Mostly Archaic Greek and Coptic.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.880
There's a lot of cataloging to be done.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.124
Here.

11:07.834 --> 11:08.926
Take it.

11:13.882 --> 11:16.806
See, you can hold it,
you can touch it, you can feel it.

11:18.303 --> 11:20.977
- You don't have to be afraid of it.
- It's so beautiful.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.892
How long do you think it took him
to make that?

11:24.434 --> 11:26.857
Three or four days, I should say.

11:28.479 --> 11:31.508
Now, here's a man who lived

11:31.608 --> 11:33.551
500 years before Christ,

11:33.651 --> 11:35.804
who probably didn't even know
how to read and write,

11:35.904 --> 11:39.954
who never went more than
a few miles from beyond his village.

11:40.158 --> 11:45.085
And yet he has made something
that has outlived Caesar,

11:45.205 --> 11:49.836
has outlived Lorenzo De' Medici,
has outlived Napoleon.

11:52.795 --> 11:55.548
And if you don't drop it,
it will outlive you and me.

12:25.912 --> 12:28.148
I am sorry I'm late.
I got a call from a patient.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.248
Oh.

12:29.332 --> 12:31.234
- You're not dressed.
- Mother, I'm sorry.

12:31.334 --> 12:33.052
I just forgot all about it.

12:34.712 --> 12:36.180
What's that supposed to mean?

12:36.547 --> 12:38.766
It's supposed to mean "hmm," that's all.

12:40.301 --> 12:43.145
It's not like you
to forget Uncle Charlie's party.

12:43.388 --> 12:46.358
- You're his favorite.
- Got a lot of work to do.

12:46.683 --> 12:49.812
- Sam, is something wrong?
- No, I'm fine.

12:54.899 --> 12:55.946
Have you

12:57.193 --> 12:58.570
heard from Sarah lately?

12:58.695 --> 13:00.013
Yeah.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.036
She called to say the divorce was final.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.435
Do me a favor, don't start
that "hmm" stuff again, okay?

13:05.535 --> 13:06.787
I'm in no mood for it.

13:08.329 --> 13:11.774
Look, just tell Uncle Charlie
I'm sorry I couldn't make it.

13:11.874 --> 13:14.468
Come on, Sam. Uncle Charlie's not so bad.

13:15.545 --> 13:18.970
Besides, how long is it since
you've gone out and seen people?

13:19.382 --> 13:22.302
I appreciate what you're trying to do,
but I don't need a social director.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.138
All right, Sam, what's happening?

13:27.807 --> 13:29.104
I lost a patient.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.734
What happened?

13:31.102 --> 13:34.652
A guy named George Bynum.
It was all over the Daily News.

13:35.106 --> 13:37.905
- Stabbed to death.
- That's awful.

13:38.026 --> 13:40.470
You wanna know the truth?
I'll tell you the truth.

13:40.570 --> 13:43.139
I think he would have been better off
seeing a priest or a rabbi.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.307
Come on, Sam.

13:44.407 --> 13:45.850
Instead of paying 75 bucks an hour

13:45.950 --> 13:48.231
to a doctor who can't even hold
his own marriage together.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.313
Now, you listen to me.

13:50.413 --> 13:53.257
I'm not talking mother-son,
I'm talking shrink to shrink.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.652
When a man's wife leaves him,

13:55.752 --> 13:58.655
- after seven years of marriage...
- Eight.

13:58.755 --> 14:00.490
Eight years of marriage.

14:00.590 --> 14:03.117
There's supposed to be some kind
of emotional reaction.

14:03.217 --> 14:04.994
He's supposed to feel a lot of pain.

14:05.094 --> 14:06.574
He's supposed to feel a lot of anger.

14:06.637 --> 14:09.123
It's not particularly pleasant,
but he's got to go through it.

14:09.223 --> 14:12.252
- But what...
- But in my case,

14:12.352 --> 14:15.880
I'm creating an elaborate system
of highly structured activities

14:15.980 --> 14:18.403
so I can avoid dealing
with my own emotion.

14:19.317 --> 14:22.036
But then there's nothing really new
about that, is there?

14:23.363 --> 14:24.615
Okay?

14:25.573 --> 14:28.702
Just tell Uncle Charlie I can't make it,
and I'll take a rain check.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.154
April 15th.

14:40.254 --> 14:42.824
I think George Bynum
is in some kind of trouble.

14:42.924 --> 14:45.473
At today's session,
he was distracted and upset.

14:47.637 --> 14:48.854
Listen, doctor.

14:51.516 --> 14:53.689
Let me ask you a question, okay?

14:56.604 --> 14:58.606
I mean, just hypothetically.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.444
Now, what if

15:03.986 --> 15:05.408
you found out

15:08.658 --> 15:11.832
that someone you knew
had actually killed somebody,

15:12.620 --> 15:18.093
and because her family is rich,
nobody found out about it?

15:19.752 --> 15:21.925
Actually, I'm the only one
who knows about it.

15:22.964 --> 15:24.011
Except for you.

15:24.966 --> 15:28.345
Anyway, what I wanted to know
is if somebody

15:30.430 --> 15:35.275
had done something like that
before, killed somebody.

15:38.688 --> 15:42.158
Is it likely that they would do it again?

15:55.121 --> 15:56.247
Angelo?

16:06.299 --> 16:07.391
Angelo?

16:24.901 --> 16:26.153
Anybody out there?

17:10.570 --> 17:11.617
Who's there?

18:52.882 --> 18:54.008
Dr. Rice?

18:57.887 --> 18:59.288
- What happened to the light?
- I don't know.

18:59.388 --> 19:02.041
Somebody must have pulled
the wrong switch.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.644
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

19:09.065 --> 19:12.319
The doorman said you might be down here.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.784
I'm very sorry
if I'm disturbing you, but...

19:17.865 --> 19:20.709
I felt very, very badly
about breaking that figurine

19:20.826 --> 19:22.874
in your office this afternoon so I...

19:23.496 --> 19:24.839
I brought you...

19:25.581 --> 19:26.753
Come on inside.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.265
Just a second, I'll get the lights.

19:42.598 --> 19:43.895
Here, let me take your coat.

19:44.392 --> 19:48.004
Oh, no, I can't stay.

19:48.104 --> 19:49.606
I just wanted to give you this.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.745
Here, let me. May I?

20:06.038 --> 20:07.290
I hope you like her.

20:11.961 --> 20:13.053
She's a...

20:13.963 --> 20:15.465
She's a Tanagra.

20:16.590 --> 20:19.869
They were terracotta figures,
made in Greece in the third century BC.

20:19.969 --> 20:21.937
She's very delicate.

20:23.764 --> 20:27.501
This was probably a small bowl
or a sheaf of wheat,

20:27.601 --> 20:29.820
that she's carrying
in the hand that's missing.

20:30.312 --> 20:32.381
These little figures were placed in tombs

20:32.481 --> 20:37.362
to keep the dead from being so lonely.

20:39.822 --> 20:44.077
I gave back the watch.
I didn't mention anything about you.

20:44.785 --> 20:45.832
Look...

20:47.621 --> 20:49.261
I think I know what you're going through.

20:50.458 --> 20:53.177
I mean, when you lose
someone you love, you...

20:55.337 --> 21:00.180
If there's any way that I can help,
not as a doctor, but just to talk.

21:03.012 --> 21:04.514
You don't understand.

21:10.853 --> 21:12.196
I didn't love George.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.817
I don't know what he told you about me.

21:22.198 --> 21:24.701
Well, it's late. I have to go.

21:27.828 --> 21:29.080
If you change your mind...

21:31.207 --> 21:32.504
All right.

21:36.212 --> 21:39.615
You know, the more I could see
of that new girl in the office,

21:39.715 --> 21:42.639
the more I think
that she's definitely your type.

21:44.053 --> 21:45.646
And what do you think that is?

21:46.639 --> 21:47.640
Stiff.

21:50.559 --> 21:53.153
I mean, she's very tense.

21:54.396 --> 21:57.076
One look at her and you know that
what she really needs is a good...

21:58.609 --> 21:59.635
May 19th.

21:59.735 --> 22:03.706
There's something very bizarre going on
with your little girlfriend, Miss Reynolds.

22:04.532 --> 22:05.652
You remember, I had told you

22:05.658 --> 22:09.288
that she'd moved into
an apartment building right behind mine.

22:09.411 --> 22:11.084
Which I find very significant.

22:12.581 --> 22:14.400
Anyway, last night I was getting dressed,

22:14.500 --> 22:17.094
to go out to have some dinner
with some friends.

23:24.570 --> 23:25.888
June 23rd.

23:25.988 --> 23:28.457
George Bynum canceled
his next two sessions.

23:28.574 --> 23:31.168
He let me know that he was going
away with his girlfriend.

23:31.493 --> 23:33.587
Well, you haven't asked me about Brooke.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.460
Aren't you curious about her?

23:36.248 --> 23:37.340
Should I be?

23:42.588 --> 23:44.261
I took a photograph of her.

23:46.759 --> 23:49.182
Come to think of it,
you never ask me about Brooke.

23:50.346 --> 23:52.189
You ask me about my wife.

23:52.806 --> 23:54.353
You ask me about my boss.

23:55.684 --> 23:57.311
But you never ask me about Brooke.

23:59.688 --> 24:01.190
Why is that, doctor?

24:02.942 --> 24:07.118
You know, I think you're beginning
to have a problem about her.

24:10.532 --> 24:12.034
September 19th.

24:13.869 --> 24:16.543
The patient reported a dream
in today's session.

24:17.206 --> 24:20.210
In the dream,
he was walking down a wooded lane.

28:08.061 --> 28:09.233
Yes, may I help you?

28:09.354 --> 28:12.233
I have an appointment
with a Detective Vitucci.

28:12.941 --> 28:14.568
- Dr. Rice?
- Yes.

28:14.693 --> 28:16.741
Be right with you. I'll take care of this.

28:16.862 --> 28:18.582
Let me get back
to you on Monday, all right?

28:18.614 --> 28:19.866
Okay, bye-bye.

28:21.783 --> 28:24.353
Hi, I'm Gail Phillips.
I was one of George Bynum's assistants.

28:24.453 --> 28:26.413
- How do you do?
- I'll show you the way upstairs.

28:27.122 --> 28:29.966
- Have you been to Crispins before?
- No.

28:30.125 --> 28:32.628
Shall I give you the tour?
It's a long walk.

28:33.420 --> 28:35.138
- Why not.
- All right.

28:35.422 --> 28:38.141
Crispins is the oldest auction house
in the United States.

28:38.300 --> 28:41.970
It was founded in 1811, it's been
in continuous operation ever since.

28:42.638 --> 28:45.642
Crispins has branches
in London, New York, Paris,

28:45.766 --> 28:48.815
Geneva, Boston and Los Angeles.

28:49.102 --> 28:51.605
We have an excellent Blue Cross
program for our employees,

28:51.730 --> 28:53.778
which covers full psychiatric benefits.

28:53.899 --> 28:56.322
But I'm sure George Bynum
must have told you about that.

28:56.944 --> 29:00.222
Downstairs are the conference rooms,
the auction room,

29:00.322 --> 29:01.723
and the exhibition room.

29:01.823 --> 29:05.835
Up here on the fourth floor, this is
where all the slave labor takes place.

29:07.496 --> 29:08.964
Quite a mess, isn't it?

29:11.333 --> 29:12.568
My.

29:12.668 --> 29:14.736
It actually all gets
sorted out eventually.

29:14.836 --> 29:16.008
Sorry.

29:17.839 --> 29:19.307
Where do all this stuff come from?

29:19.424 --> 29:22.473
Estates, galleries, private collections.

29:22.678 --> 29:25.682
Actually, most of it comes
from just ordinary people.

29:26.306 --> 29:28.809
Now, once things get to Crispins,
after they're receipted,

29:28.934 --> 29:30.356
they're all sent
to their proper department.

29:30.477 --> 29:33.692
Sculpture to the sculpture department,
and prints to the print department,

29:33.855 --> 29:35.323
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

29:36.483 --> 29:37.700
And then about a week before the auction,

29:37.818 --> 29:40.429
everything is sent downstairs
into the exhibition rooms.

29:40.529 --> 29:42.764
And the night before,
it's all put backstage.

29:42.864 --> 29:47.165
And finally, on the day of the sale,
it's put up for auction and hopefully sold.

29:47.286 --> 29:49.771
That's the end of the speech,
the end of the tour.

29:49.871 --> 29:51.043
The police.

29:55.168 --> 29:56.511
Thank you very much.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.016
I appreciate your coming over.

30:01.383 --> 30:03.556
I know you're a busy man,
I'll try not to keep you too long.

30:03.677 --> 30:04.849
No problem.

30:08.890 --> 30:11.126
Miss Wilson, yeah,
please come in now, okay?

30:11.226 --> 30:12.352
Thanks.

30:13.353 --> 30:15.071
Yesterday when we were talking,

30:15.188 --> 30:18.192
you said that the deceased
came to see you twice a week, right?

30:21.903 --> 30:24.497
According to this, Bynum
was seeing you five times a week.

30:25.991 --> 30:27.083
That's impossible.

30:27.826 --> 30:31.313
Miss Wilson, how often did Mr. Bynum
have an appointment with his psychiatrist?

30:31.413 --> 30:32.460
Five times a week.

30:34.249 --> 30:36.468
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

30:37.919 --> 30:39.921
If that's all, I have a lot work to do.

30:40.047 --> 30:42.846
Fine. Thanks, Miss Wilson.
Please close the door.

30:47.095 --> 30:49.748
We found out that Bynum was fooling around
with at least one of the women here.

30:49.848 --> 30:52.000
And I think he was using you as the cover.

30:52.100 --> 30:53.540
And you're gonna ask me who that is?

30:53.602 --> 30:55.842
And you're gonna tell me
that's confidential information.

30:58.106 --> 31:00.450
Since yesterday
I found out a couple more things.

31:00.942 --> 31:03.428
First, we're pretty sure
Bynum was killed by a woman.

31:03.528 --> 31:07.457
Second, since his wife was in Florida
at the time, we know it wasn't her.

31:07.616 --> 31:09.459
And third, the guys at Forensic came up

31:09.576 --> 31:11.954
with a sort of psychological
portrait of the killer.

31:12.079 --> 31:13.547
And they think she'll try it again.

31:14.289 --> 31:16.817
Doctor, I get the feeling you know
a lot more than you're telling me.

31:16.917 --> 31:18.527
- Wait a minute.
- I don't know what you're trying to hide.

31:18.627 --> 31:19.736
Wait a minute.

31:19.836 --> 31:22.531
George Bynum was a patient of mine
for almost two years.

31:22.631 --> 31:26.034
And I'm just as much concerned
about what happened to him as you are.

31:26.134 --> 31:27.661
Dr. Rice.

31:27.761 --> 31:30.330
I don't know what they can do to
a psychiatrist who withholds information,

31:30.430 --> 31:32.524
but I can promise you this for a fact.

31:32.641 --> 31:35.761
You're gonna end up in a lot of trouble
if you don't get yourself killed first.

31:38.772 --> 31:40.069
Thank you for coming over.

31:58.500 --> 32:00.173
- Yes?
- Mom, Sam.

32:00.335 --> 32:02.929
- Hi, how are you?
- I'm fine.

32:03.422 --> 32:06.408
Listen, why don't you and I
have dinner tonight.

32:06.508 --> 32:08.910
I thought I'd order
in some Chinese, and...

32:09.010 --> 32:11.183
All right, Sam, what's wrong?

32:11.763 --> 32:15.188
Well, as a matter of fact,
I got a little problem.

32:16.143 --> 32:19.363
What would you say if I told you
that I'd been to bed with your girlfriend?

32:23.608 --> 32:24.860
You aren't curious?

32:26.820 --> 32:30.450
Anyway, night before last,
Brooke and I were working late.

32:30.866 --> 32:32.618
Everybody else had gone home.

32:34.953 --> 32:36.500
And...

32:37.456 --> 32:38.833
I don't know why.

32:41.001 --> 32:44.050
I guess, I just wanted to see
what would happen.

32:45.881 --> 32:49.055
I reached out and put my hand
on the back of her neck.

32:52.220 --> 32:53.847
She didn't make a move.

32:55.807 --> 32:57.184
She didn't say a word.

32:58.226 --> 32:59.648
And I kissed her.

33:02.731 --> 33:06.156
And then I started to unbutton her blouse.

33:08.862 --> 33:11.035
And I put my hand on her.

33:14.701 --> 33:17.500
And she didn't make a move to stop me.

33:30.342 --> 33:31.935
What did you tell the police about me?

33:32.093 --> 33:33.310
Nothing.

33:34.429 --> 33:36.773
- What's the matter?
- Don't lie to me, please.

33:38.225 --> 33:40.694
That detective had me in his office
all afternoon.

33:42.437 --> 33:44.735
- You must have told him something.
- They're questioning everyone

33:44.856 --> 33:47.109
- who worked with George.
- No, no, no, that's not it.

33:49.611 --> 33:51.113
He knew something else.

33:52.614 --> 33:53.706
I could tell.

33:54.783 --> 33:56.351
Brooke, I think it's very naive
of you to think

33:56.451 --> 33:58.795
that they're not gonna find out
about you sooner or later.

33:58.912 --> 34:00.630
Not if you don't tell them!

34:02.123 --> 34:04.046
You're the only one who knew about us.

34:07.295 --> 34:08.763
What is it you're so afraid of?

34:16.304 --> 34:18.398
I was with him the night he was killed.

34:19.975 --> 34:23.103
We, we had been having this affair,
and I was trying...

34:25.981 --> 34:30.827
I told him I'd meet him,
one last time at the bar near Crispins.

34:32.779 --> 34:33.951
He's...

34:36.324 --> 34:37.496
It got very ugly.

34:37.659 --> 34:40.833
And I told him that
I never wanted to see him again.

34:41.788 --> 34:43.165
And he laughed at me.

34:45.417 --> 34:49.342
He told me there was no way on Earth
that he would ever allow that to happen.

34:49.462 --> 34:51.339
So I left. I just walked out.

34:51.672 --> 34:54.096
He followed me, he tried
to make me get in the car with him.

34:54.342 --> 34:57.437
I wouldn't go. I walked home.
I left him there.

34:59.306 --> 35:03.814
I must have been the last person
to see him alive.

35:15.030 --> 35:17.658
When I woke up in the morning
I saw the papers.

35:17.782 --> 35:19.034
I couldn't believe it.

35:22.203 --> 35:23.375
It was...

35:25.707 --> 35:27.004
It was horrible.

35:27.709 --> 35:29.131
I saw the picture.

35:30.045 --> 35:31.888
This man that I thought I'd loved.

35:36.009 --> 35:38.137
It was horrible, but you know what I felt?

35:40.972 --> 35:42.224
I felt relieved.

35:44.476 --> 35:46.069
All I kept thinking was...

35:48.688 --> 35:50.031
I'm so glad.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.902
I'm so glad he's out of my life.

35:58.239 --> 36:03.419
Don't you think that there's something
a little bit wrong with that?

36:05.580 --> 36:07.924
I mean, with me?

36:19.094 --> 36:21.267
First of all,
let's get one thing straight.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.434
You're not responsible
for what happened to George Bynum,

36:25.600 --> 36:27.068
just because you're glad he's dead.

36:28.561 --> 36:33.283
And whatever you're feeling now,
guilt, remorse, whatever it is,

36:33.608 --> 36:37.238
it's human, it's understandable,
it's something we all share.

36:38.571 --> 36:39.788
Nothing wrong with that.

37:13.398 --> 37:14.490
It's my mother.

37:17.152 --> 37:18.449
I'll call you later.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.555
And that's when he wakes from the dream.

37:20.655 --> 37:24.000
Okay, let's have one last go
at the traditional stuff.

37:24.117 --> 37:26.336
- Box woman.
- Green jealousy.

37:26.453 --> 37:30.106
So we start by considering the possibility
that we're dealing with a jealous woman.

37:30.206 --> 37:31.816
Since George Bynum puts the box
in his pocket,

37:31.916 --> 37:35.236
I can only assume that he thinks he has some
sort of control over the jealous woman.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.847
Until something goes wrong
and she gets loose.

37:38.339 --> 37:39.419
What about the little girl?

37:39.507 --> 37:42.410
Did he tell you
why he was frightened of her?

37:42.510 --> 37:44.308
He gave me the dream, that's all.

37:44.846 --> 37:48.083
I can only think that she's
some sort of displacement

37:48.183 --> 37:50.606
- for the mother or the sister.
- No, no, not at all.

37:51.311 --> 37:52.711
We're probably dealing with a woman

37:52.854 --> 37:55.423
who on the surface
seems childlike and innocent,

37:55.523 --> 37:58.493
but underneath is capable
of extreme violence.

37:59.861 --> 38:01.863
Sam, I still think you should go
to the police.

38:03.198 --> 38:04.324
With what?

38:04.449 --> 38:05.850
What kind of evidence do I have?

38:05.950 --> 38:08.728
A green box and a little girl
who's mean to her teddy bear.

38:08.828 --> 38:10.647
Come on, Grace, you know better than that.

38:10.747 --> 38:14.609
Well, if you're not going to the police,
why are you getting mixed up in this?

38:14.709 --> 38:20.615
I told you before, I spent almost two years,
two hours a week, talking to this man.

38:20.715 --> 38:22.909
I wanna find out why he was killed.

38:23.009 --> 38:25.453
Sam, you're not equipped to deal
with this sort of thing.

38:25.553 --> 38:29.482
If you don't look out, you're going to put
yourself in a very dangerous position.

38:30.225 --> 38:32.899
- Go to the police, please.
- I'll think about it.

38:34.062 --> 38:35.188
Sam.

38:36.189 --> 38:37.236
Mom.

38:38.650 --> 38:41.594
Do you remember when I wanted
to quit school and play pro-ball?

38:41.694 --> 38:44.973
When I got that offer from that
Class A team, in Knoxville?

38:45.073 --> 38:47.434
I called you up and I told you
what I wanted to do,

38:47.534 --> 38:49.602
and you got on the first train
to New Haven.

38:49.702 --> 38:51.479
- If you had really wanted to quit...
- Really wanted to quit,

38:51.579 --> 38:53.627
I wouldn't have called you, okay.

38:54.415 --> 38:58.319
And you sat with me for six hours,
and you let me talk myself out of it.

38:58.419 --> 39:00.592
You were right and I'm not sorry.

39:01.339 --> 39:05.181
I mean, I'm a much better shrink than I
ever would have been a second baseman.

39:06.427 --> 39:08.771
But I closed some kind of a door that day.

39:10.014 --> 39:11.534
And I've been closing them ever since.

39:12.934 --> 39:16.689
What I'm doing now may be irrational.

39:17.605 --> 39:19.027
Maybe it is foolish.

39:20.775 --> 39:21.947
But I gotta do it.

39:23.194 --> 39:24.286
Oh, Sam.

43:49.043 --> 43:50.090
Who's there?

43:51.337 --> 43:52.338
Brooke?

43:54.715 --> 43:57.264
All right, give me all your money.

43:58.845 --> 44:00.062
All right.

44:00.304 --> 44:01.305
Okay.

44:03.307 --> 44:05.309
I've got about 50 or 60 here.

44:05.977 --> 44:07.069
I'll take that, man!

44:09.397 --> 44:10.569
Now look, I...

44:11.399 --> 44:13.401
I know this sounds a little crazy, but...

44:14.193 --> 44:15.410
I'd like to ask you a favor.

44:18.948 --> 44:19.995
My wallet.

44:21.075 --> 44:22.577
You want my wallet, don't you?

44:23.744 --> 44:26.418
Master Charge, Visa, American Express?

44:27.915 --> 44:29.007
Hey, look, man.

44:29.917 --> 44:33.012
- You try something with me...
- Oh, no, no.

44:34.338 --> 44:38.760
I just want you to stay here,
and watch me.

44:39.552 --> 44:41.930
And make sure I get out to the park okay.

44:43.097 --> 44:44.098
Okay?

44:47.602 --> 44:48.603
Your coat.

44:50.521 --> 44:51.521
What?

44:51.606 --> 44:54.075
I want your coat, give me your coat.

44:58.571 --> 44:59.572
You got it.

45:02.617 --> 45:08.499
- Now, I ain't gonna tell you again.
- All right.

45:27.391 --> 45:28.483
Thanks a lot.

45:51.499 --> 45:54.527
Personal effects will be returned to you
as soon as Forensics is through with them.

45:54.627 --> 45:56.880
About your coat, tough luck.

45:57.004 --> 46:00.178
Now, would you mind telling me
just what you were doing here?

46:02.843 --> 46:06.472
I was having a problem with a patient.

46:07.515 --> 46:10.564
Decided to go for a walk
and think things out.

46:10.977 --> 46:12.069
In Central Park?

46:13.896 --> 46:15.148
You took a walk?

46:16.357 --> 46:18.530
Well, I went a little further
than I intended.

46:19.402 --> 46:21.200
And somebody grabbed me, that's it.

46:21.362 --> 46:22.454
You're kidding.

46:26.867 --> 46:28.978
Murray, do me a favor.
Call the squad and see what they want.

46:29.078 --> 46:30.204
You got it.

46:34.875 --> 46:37.235
Doctor, I think there's something
here you don't understand.

46:37.336 --> 46:39.213
Someone tried to kill you last night.

46:39.505 --> 46:40.597
I don't buy that.

46:41.882 --> 46:45.728
Look, a patient of mine was murdered
for whatever reasons.

46:45.886 --> 46:48.623
A couple of days later,
by coincidence, I go for a walk.

46:48.723 --> 46:52.210
I go into the park, I get mugged.
The guy who mugs me, gets mugged himself.

46:52.310 --> 46:55.071
He puts up a struggle, he gets killed.
I mean, that happens every day.

46:55.771 --> 46:58.570
First, the guy was killed because
he was wearing your coat, okay?

46:58.691 --> 47:00.910
Now, second, I just lost five bucks
to this schnook,

47:01.068 --> 47:03.346
because the pattern of the wounds
is the same as George Bynum's.

47:03.446 --> 47:06.199
And I got another 20
says she's not finished yet.

47:26.635 --> 47:27.727
Who is it?

47:28.262 --> 47:31.106
It's me, Sam. I've gotta talk to you.

48:01.962 --> 48:03.009
Hi.

48:04.173 --> 48:07.518
Mr. Chong, this is Dr. Rice.
Dr. Rice, Mr. Chong.

48:14.683 --> 48:15.730
Where were you last night?

48:16.268 --> 48:19.488
I went back to Crispins
and tried to do some work.

48:19.605 --> 48:23.326
I called you about 11:00 or 11:30 and...

48:26.070 --> 48:28.014
I went for a walk.

48:28.114 --> 48:30.391
You were gone forever.

48:30.491 --> 48:32.744
I called a couple of times.

48:34.620 --> 48:36.167
It's a long walk.

48:39.333 --> 48:41.176
It wasn't anything important.

48:43.963 --> 48:46.216
- I was just wondering...
- I was just... What?

48:54.306 --> 48:56.183
You do this sort of thing regularly?

48:57.184 --> 48:59.128
Oh, I have a bad back.

48:59.228 --> 49:03.734
Mr. Chong usually comes at night,
but today is his daughter's birthday.

49:04.817 --> 49:06.535
When will I see you again?

49:09.447 --> 49:10.869
My last patient is at 7:00.

49:14.660 --> 49:17.664
There's a very important auction
tonight at Crispins.

49:18.497 --> 49:19.794
And...

49:22.042 --> 49:25.296
And I'm going to be handling
the bidding for an Italian client.

49:27.673 --> 49:30.677
One of the pieces should go
for over a million dollars so...

49:30.843 --> 49:34.038
if you've never been to an auction,

49:34.138 --> 49:36.624
maybe you would find it...

49:36.724 --> 49:39.001
very, very...

49:39.101 --> 49:40.728
exciting.

49:44.398 --> 49:45.900
Sure it would be.

49:47.359 --> 49:48.576
It starts at 8:00.

49:58.954 --> 50:02.083
I've got a patient in about half an hour.

50:02.625 --> 50:03.717
Sam.

50:04.043 --> 50:05.090
Yeah?

50:07.546 --> 50:08.593
Nothing.

50:09.840 --> 50:10.841
Sam.

50:13.636 --> 50:15.604
What did you want to see me about?

50:21.560 --> 50:22.857
Nothing.

50:52.758 --> 50:54.305
Dr. Rice?

50:57.638 --> 50:59.373
Brooke asked me to watch out for you.

50:59.473 --> 51:01.271
Would you come with me please?

51:20.828 --> 51:25.608
I can't tell you how much Mr. Bynum's
death has upset everyone around here.

51:25.708 --> 51:28.694
This afternoon, Gail Phillips and I
were talking about it,

51:28.794 --> 51:32.114
and Brooke got angry
and told us to shut up.

51:32.214 --> 51:34.683
Doctor, I'm really very worried about her.

51:36.552 --> 51:38.429
Well, Brooke is waiting
for you in her office.

51:38.554 --> 51:41.023
It's the one at the end.
It's the only one with the light on.

51:41.932 --> 51:43.275
- Well...
- Thank you very much.

51:43.392 --> 51:44.689
Bye.

52:23.307 --> 52:25.230
- Hi.
- Hello.

52:28.062 --> 52:30.281
- How did you get up here?
- Heather.

52:31.732 --> 52:32.824
Heather.

52:34.568 --> 52:35.569
Yeah.

52:39.406 --> 52:42.476
I just came up here
to get some last minute bids.

52:42.576 --> 52:43.623
Brooke?

52:44.078 --> 52:45.125
Are you there?

52:45.496 --> 52:48.090
The auction's starting. You better hurry.

52:50.167 --> 52:52.945
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
and welcome to Crispins.

01:02:39.673 --> 01:02:41.926
Said Bynum was in his place
the night he was killed,

01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:44.428
with a woman, and they had a big fight.

01:02:44.552 --> 01:02:46.872
She went running out
and he followed after her.

01:02:46.972 --> 01:02:51.209
So I thought I'd bring this guy here,
see maybe if he can make an identification.

01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:53.107
Who knows, maybe we'll get lucky, eh?

01:02:53.228 --> 01:02:54.821
I hope so.

That concludes tonight's auction of important

01:06:58.515 --> 01:07:00.688

01:07:01.059 --> 01:07:02.859

01:07:02.936 --> 01:07:05.405
Your purchases are ready downstairs.

01:07:05.522 --> 01:07:07.650
And remember that part two

01:07:07.774 --> 01:07:10.243

here at Crispins

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:12.863
with important
Greek and Roman antiquities.

01:07:12.987 --> 01:07:16.867
You've been a wonderful audience.
Thank you all again. Good night.

01:07:48.356 --> 01:07:50.108
- Miss Phillips? Excuse me.
- Oh, hi.

01:07:50.233 --> 01:07:52.611
- Can I talk to you for a moment please?
- Sure.

01:07:54.195 --> 01:07:57.495
I'm trying to locate Brooke Reynolds. She
was gonna meet me here half an hour ago.

01:07:57.615 --> 01:08:01.419
- Do you have any idea where she is?
- Haven't seen her since the sale.

01:08:01.536 --> 01:08:03.959
- Did you try her apartment?
- Yes, she's not there.

01:08:05.123 --> 01:08:07.421
Well, you might call her
tomorrow morning at work.

01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:09.044
She gets in between 9:30 and 10:00.

01:08:09.168 --> 01:08:12.426
Wait a minute. I've gotta talk to her,
it's very important.

01:08:14.215 --> 01:08:15.888
Oh, she's gonna kill me.

01:08:16.384 --> 01:08:19.178
Her parents have a house out in Long
Island. She goes out there sometimes.

01:08:19.304 --> 01:08:21.180
- Where?
- It's in Glen Cove.

01:08:21.346 --> 01:08:26.102
- It's on Wood Street or Wood Lane.
- Okay, thanks.

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:23.205
Brooke?

01:09:51.979 --> 01:09:53.572
Anybody here?

01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:25.371
Miss Phillips?

01:10:25.471 --> 01:10:28.099
Oh, my God... You scared me to death.

01:10:28.391 --> 01:10:29.893
I'm sorry to bother you this late.

01:10:30.351 --> 01:10:32.795
I was wondering if I could talk
to you for a few minutes.

01:10:32.895 --> 01:10:34.989
Well, it's important.

01:10:35.106 --> 01:10:36.278
It's about Miss Reynolds.

01:10:37.817 --> 01:10:39.160
Sure.

01:10:40.319 --> 01:10:41.411
You wanna come up?

01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:47.167
How did you find me?

01:10:49.328 --> 01:10:51.956
What's-her-name?
Your friend that works with you.

01:10:53.291 --> 01:10:55.214
She told me you might be out here.

01:11:07.972 --> 01:11:10.600
All right, it was wrong for me
to go through your desk.

01:11:10.725 --> 01:11:12.068
I'm sorry about that.

01:11:12.185 --> 01:11:13.277
I mean, I can understand how you feel.

01:11:13.394 --> 01:11:17.115
How can you understand how I feel
if you don't know anything about me?

01:11:17.565 --> 01:11:18.691
You're right.

01:11:18.816 --> 01:11:20.259
I don't know anything about you.

01:11:20.359 --> 01:11:24.201
But I know this much, I know the police
think you killed George Bynum.

01:11:26.449 --> 01:11:28.326
What do you think?

01:11:32.038 --> 01:11:33.585
Do you think I killed him?

01:11:34.373 --> 01:11:35.545
No.

01:11:38.252 --> 01:11:39.378
But you're not sure.

01:11:41.798 --> 01:11:43.015
Listen to me!

01:11:47.929 --> 01:11:49.849
On account of you,
I'm an accessory to something,

01:11:49.931 --> 01:11:51.541
I don't know what.

01:11:51.641 --> 01:11:54.520
I'm withholding evidence,
I'm obstructing justice.

01:11:54.644 --> 01:11:57.797
I'm gonna get my license revoked
if I'm not thrown into jail first.

01:11:57.897 --> 01:12:01.276
And on top of that, I've just spent $15,000
for a painting I don't even like.

01:12:26.342 --> 01:12:27.719
That's the man in the clipping.

01:12:30.263 --> 01:12:31.560
That's my father.

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:37.733
Sam, I don't know how those things
got into my desk.

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:39.982
- All that happened a long time ago.
- All what?

01:12:41.399 --> 01:12:42.616
My father's death.

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:53.623
What happened?

01:12:57.498 --> 01:12:59.341
This house belonged to my mother.

01:13:04.589 --> 01:13:05.841
I grew up here.

01:13:14.432 --> 01:13:16.605
They separated when I was very little.

01:13:17.101 --> 01:13:18.819
But I remember...

01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:22.023
Well, that's when she started to drink.

01:13:22.148 --> 01:13:25.118
Anyway, I was 16.
I was away at school when...

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:28.947
they called and told me that
she finally drank herself to death.

01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:31.244
They didn't say that, but...

01:13:33.159 --> 01:13:34.832
That's what it was.

01:13:35.661 --> 01:13:37.379
I remember I felt...

01:13:38.623 --> 01:13:40.500
nothing for her.

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:43.507
No remorse, nothing.

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:50.431
After the funeral, my father came,
and took me back with him to Florence.

01:13:51.719 --> 01:13:54.017
I lived there for two years.

01:13:55.848 --> 01:13:59.022
And it was the happiest
I've ever been in my whole life.

01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:06.944
Then, on my 18th birthday in June,

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:08.907
I came into my inheritance.

01:14:09.028 --> 01:14:13.704
They had all the lawyers flew over,
and lots documents to sign.

01:14:13.824 --> 01:14:16.373
And in and among all these papers
there was a...

01:14:17.078 --> 01:14:21.999
a letter that she'd written to me,
not long before she died.

01:14:26.337 --> 01:14:27.714
In it, she said...

01:14:33.010 --> 01:14:35.513
She said she'd always loved me.

01:14:39.266 --> 01:14:42.236
And she was sorry
that I hadn't known that.

01:14:44.772 --> 01:14:47.446
She told me, my father...

01:14:48.609 --> 01:14:51.988
had turned me against her
and that that had broken her heart.

01:14:53.114 --> 01:14:55.037
She said he never loved her.

01:14:56.242 --> 01:15:00.021
He just was interested in her money.

01:15:00.121 --> 01:15:02.624
And she said, he never loved me either.

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:07.049
That he only pretended to
as a weapon against her.

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:10.218
She said she was afraid for me.
She said...

01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:17.813
I should be very, very careful of him, that
he would do anything... for the money.

01:15:20.099 --> 01:15:21.942
So I was supposed to...

01:15:22.351 --> 01:15:26.881
I was supposed to go back that afternoon, and
sign all these papers, but I couldn't, I...

01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:30.326
I didn't. I went to a chapel
that was near us and...

01:15:31.444 --> 01:15:33.913
Just to be alone, but there were
a lot of tourists there,

01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:35.498
so I went up into the bell tower.

01:15:35.614 --> 01:15:37.558
My father followed me.

01:15:37.658 --> 01:15:40.018
He was very upset. He wanted
to know what was in the letter.

01:15:40.036 --> 01:15:41.479
I wouldn't...

01:15:41.579 --> 01:15:45.459
I wouldn't tell... I didn't wanna see him.
I just wanted to get away, but he...

01:15:45.583 --> 01:15:48.712
He wouldn't let me
so I showed him the letter.

01:15:48.836 --> 01:15:49.883
He was shaking.

01:15:50.004 --> 01:15:53.099
And I remember,
the paper was shaking as he read it.

01:15:55.426 --> 01:15:58.646
When he was done,
he folded it up very carefully,

01:15:58.763 --> 01:16:00.310
and he gave it back to me.

01:16:02.433 --> 01:16:06.646
And then he made a joke, about my mother.

01:16:06.771 --> 01:16:07.988
That...

01:16:08.606 --> 01:16:10.108
That she was probably...

01:16:11.358 --> 01:16:14.032
drunk when she wrote it
or something like that.

01:16:14.153 --> 01:16:15.951
Then he smiled at me.

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:20.455
And I knew that she was right about him.

01:16:22.661 --> 01:16:24.271
He came towards me with his arms out.

01:16:24.371 --> 01:16:26.920
I suppose to embrace me.

01:16:27.458 --> 01:16:31.053
But the look on his face, it terrified me.

01:16:31.170 --> 01:16:34.094
I shook him off, and he got very angry.

01:16:34.215 --> 01:16:37.845
He grabbed me and he pushed me
against the barricade.

01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:40.058
I tried to pull away,
but that made him furious.

01:16:40.179 --> 01:16:42.273
And he held me hard against this rail,

01:16:42.389 --> 01:16:44.437
and I was sure
that it was going to give way.

01:16:44.558 --> 01:16:46.638
And then I thought,
"That's what he is trying to do."

01:16:46.727 --> 01:16:48.070
"He's trying to kill me."

01:16:48.187 --> 01:16:50.256
And I got wild, I just, I...

01:16:50.356 --> 01:16:54.111
I twisted myself around
and I hit him as hard as I could.

01:16:54.235 --> 01:16:55.612
He fell backwards.

01:16:55.736 --> 01:17:00.099
I guess he must have lost his balance,
the whole railway broke loose,

01:17:00.199 --> 01:17:03.373
and he went down, and he said my name.

01:17:11.252 --> 01:17:13.630
But I couldn't move.

01:17:17.258 --> 01:17:18.726
I just couldn't move.

01:17:28.978 --> 01:17:30.946
They said he died instantly.

01:17:36.443 --> 01:17:37.740
I just don't...

01:17:42.199 --> 01:17:43.621
There was...

01:17:44.869 --> 01:17:46.771
some scandal,

01:17:46.871 --> 01:17:49.124
at first, but it never...

01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:53.677
There wasn't even a formal inquest.

01:17:58.048 --> 01:18:00.392
Everyone knew
how much we loved each other.

01:18:07.266 --> 01:18:09.043
And you kept this buried?

01:18:09.143 --> 01:18:13.068
- Until you told George Bynum?
- No, no, I never told George this.

01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:14.691
But he knew.

01:18:16.150 --> 01:18:17.527
Yes, he did.

01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:19.737
How?

01:18:20.738 --> 01:18:22.206
I don't know how.

01:18:23.991 --> 01:18:25.413
I don't know.

01:18:27.077 --> 01:18:28.670
When I explained to him

01:18:28.787 --> 01:18:32.441
that there was no use
in our seeing each other anymore,

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:34.543
that's when he told me
he knew all about it.

01:18:36.128 --> 01:18:37.129
He threatened me.

01:18:37.254 --> 01:18:38.426
He said he would bring it all up again.

01:18:38.547 --> 01:18:41.175
I couldn't, I couldn't bear it.

01:18:42.176 --> 01:18:44.554
- And that was here in this house.
- Yes.

01:18:47.389 --> 01:18:50.359
- How did you know that?
- Because Bynum had a dream.

01:18:50.809 --> 01:18:53.904
And this house was in the dream,
and so was the person who killed him.

01:18:54.021 --> 01:18:57.321
In the dream, Bynum comes
to this house late at night.

01:18:57.441 --> 01:19:00.786
He enters a room where all the furniture
is covered with sheets.

01:19:01.654 --> 01:19:05.182
Against a far wall
is a large Oriental cabinet,

01:19:05.282 --> 01:19:06.499
like the one in your office.

01:19:09.995 --> 01:19:12.373
Inside, there's a green box.

01:19:12.498 --> 01:19:15.442
He takes the box
and puts it in his pocket.

01:19:15.542 --> 01:19:17.715
He sees a little girl sitting in a chair.

01:19:17.836 --> 01:19:19.759
She's holding a stuffed animal.

01:19:20.089 --> 01:19:23.013
She reaches across
and pulls out one of the eyes.

01:19:23.133 --> 01:19:25.477
The animal starts to bleed.

01:19:25.678 --> 01:19:28.372
Sam, I don't know
why you're doing this, I don't know.

01:19:28.472 --> 01:19:29.974
He turns and looks for a door...

01:19:32.977 --> 01:19:35.150
which leads to a long hallway.

01:19:44.405 --> 01:19:48.413
He tries to get away from her,
but she begins to follow him.

01:19:50.828 --> 01:19:52.250
The hallway opens up...

01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:55.127
into a large room.

01:20:00.754 --> 01:20:02.381
With a lot of French doors.

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:12.708
He tries to get out,
but the doors are locked.

01:20:12.808 --> 01:20:15.652
By now the child has followed him
into the room.

01:20:17.021 --> 01:20:20.366
He looks around and sees a staircase.

01:20:21.191 --> 01:20:22.283
He starts towards the...

01:20:23.235 --> 01:20:24.361
Wait a minute.

01:20:24.945 --> 01:20:26.162
There is no staircase.

01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:29.116
Yes, there is.

01:20:45.549 --> 01:20:47.222
He starts up the steps.

01:20:47.468 --> 01:20:50.562
When he gets to the top,
he tries the door, but it won't open.

01:20:50.763 --> 01:20:52.857
He can feel the child getting closer.

01:20:53.265 --> 01:20:56.610
Finally, the door opened,
steps inside, closes it behind him.

01:20:57.311 --> 01:21:00.110
And then he takes the green box
out of his pocket.

01:21:00.439 --> 01:21:02.157
It slips through his ﬁngers.

01:21:02.441 --> 01:21:03.658
It's not a green box.

01:21:05.944 --> 01:21:08.823
It sounds like green box, but it isn't.

01:21:10.741 --> 01:21:12.414
Gail Phillips at Crispins, she has a...

01:21:12.534 --> 01:21:14.207
She doesn't trust banks for some reason.

01:21:14.328 --> 01:21:17.798
She takes her paycheck and she cashes it,
and carries the money with her.

01:21:17.915 --> 01:21:19.633
Someone I forget who's...

01:21:21.126 --> 01:21:24.221
George started calling her
green bucks and it stuck.

01:21:26.465 --> 01:21:28.593
Oh, my God, I've gotta call the police.

01:21:28.717 --> 01:21:32.221
- Why? What's the matter?
- Gail Phillips killed George Bynum.

01:21:36.517 --> 01:21:38.770
- How can you know that?
- The dream.

01:21:38.894 --> 01:21:42.423
If I'm right, they were having an affair,
before you went to work at Crispins.

01:21:42.523 --> 01:21:45.697
In Gail's mind, you were the one
who ruined everything.

01:21:45.818 --> 01:21:48.992
If it weren't for you,
George Bynum would still be alive.

01:21:50.781 --> 01:21:53.660
You see, when he rejected her
for you, she killed him.

01:21:53.784 --> 01:21:55.627
And now she's trying
to make it look as if you did it.

01:21:55.744 --> 01:21:56.770
Yeah.

01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:59.874
Detective Joseph Vitucci, please.
Dr. Sam Rice calling.

01:22:04.628 --> 01:22:07.427
I'm pretty sure Gail's the one
who put those clippings in your desk

01:22:07.548 --> 01:22:09.095
hoping the police would find them.

01:22:09.216 --> 01:22:12.595
And if that doesn't work,
she's gonna have to kill you.

01:22:16.014 --> 01:22:18.174
Would you please try and find him,
it's very important.

01:22:37.578 --> 01:22:38.704
Wait a minute.

01:22:39.121 --> 01:22:40.794
Who told you that I was out here?

01:22:44.126 --> 01:22:45.503
I think we had better go.

01:23:26.877 --> 01:23:27.877
Oh, my God.

01:23:27.961 --> 01:23:30.180
- What?
- I forgot my keys.

01:23:31.256 --> 01:23:33.350
Brooke!

01:27:18.316 --> 01:27:19.408
Jump.

01:27:22.904 --> 01:27:23.905
What?

01:27:30.287 --> 01:27:32.085
- Jump.
- Don't!

01:27:32.456 --> 01:27:33.833
No!
