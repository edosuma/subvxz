00:01.267 --> 00:03.102
Man: Carroll
was convicted in 2004

00:03.104 --> 00:06.872
For the murders
of 14 young women.

00:08.576 --> 00:10.509
Claire, no!

00:10.511 --> 00:11.710
Ohh!

00:11.712 --> 00:13.545
How's claire?

00:14.548 --> 00:16.715
How's claire?

00:18.151 --> 00:19.785
This week,
marks the anniversary

00:19.787 --> 00:21.420
Of joe carroll's death.

00:26.694 --> 00:29.728
In a brutal slaying that
occurred on a downtown subway.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.263
Looks like there's
a new cult.

00:31.265 --> 00:31.964
Who are they?

00:31.966 --> 00:33.932
Barry: Ryan tells me
you're law enforcement.

00:33.934 --> 00:35.200
Yep. I'm a cop.

00:35.202 --> 00:36.702
Just made detective.

00:36.704 --> 00:37.970
What am I
doing here?

00:42.476 --> 00:43.709
Ryan: I want
no part of this, mike.

00:43.711 --> 00:46.812
This is over for me,
all right? I'm done.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.881
Max: Did you share
what you know
with the bureau?

00:48.883 --> 00:50.816
What, this?
This is a hobby.

00:50.818 --> 00:52.117
All right, guys.
What do you got?

00:52.119 --> 00:55.154
Mike: Ok. One match.
Carlos...Perez.

00:55.156 --> 00:57.723
You were in havenport
with joe carroll.

00:57.725 --> 00:58.590
Where is he?

00:58.592 --> 01:01.560
I haven't seen joe
since the lighthouse.

01:01.562 --> 01:04.563
I picked him up
on the beach.

01:06.032 --> 01:06.799
What happened?

01:06.801 --> 01:08.834
Ryan hardy showed up
at my place.

01:09.536 --> 01:12.171
Mike: Heather clarke.
She lives in the building
across the street,

01:12.173 --> 01:13.605
Where she was killed
and moved here.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.607
I mean, the murders
on the subway were
a spectacle,

01:15.609 --> 01:16.608
An announcement.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.577
This is a very
specific message.

01:18.579 --> 01:19.845
With regards
to the subway murders

01:19.847 --> 01:23.682
And joe carroll,
I'm not involved.

01:23.684 --> 01:25.584
Well now.

Last-minute homework.

01:55.950 --> 01:58.784
Yes. Her paper is
coming along very nicely.

01:58.786 --> 02:04.690
I think miss givens
will be very pleased indeed.

02:04.692 --> 02:06.558
Want some breakfast,
my love?

02:06.560 --> 02:07.893
Just some coffee.

Hmm.

Was he doing your
homework for you?

02:15.136 --> 02:16.201
No, ma'am.

02:16.203 --> 02:19.705
Mm-hmm. Go on.
Get to school.

02:19.707 --> 02:22.875
Bye, mama!
Bye, uncle daryl.

02:22.877 --> 02:27.846
[southern accent]
you have a good day
now, mandy honey.

02:27.848 --> 02:28.747
Your country voice stinks.

02:28.749 --> 02:32.417
I know. I'm still
having trouble
with my hard rs,

02:32.419 --> 02:34.553
But the speech
patterns themselves

02:34.555 --> 02:36.755

with your coffee?

02:43.230 --> 02:46.165
You better not be doing
her homework again.

02:46.167 --> 02:47.766
That girl ain't gonna
learn anything

02:47.768 --> 02:50.235
If you're filling in
all the blanks.

02:50.237 --> 02:51.837
Yes, yes, of course.

too smart,

sniffing.

Oh, not much danger
of that, darling.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.949
You didn't get
much sleep.

03:03.951 --> 03:06.385
Heard you up all night
watching the news.

03:06.387 --> 03:09.855
Oh, it was
a natural curiosity.

03:09.857 --> 03:12.391
It was rather
alarming seeing

03:12.393 --> 03:14.793
The murders
in new york, you know?

03:14.795 --> 03:17.362
It's your cult,
isn't it?

03:17.364 --> 03:22.201
Oh, possibly.
I have really no ideas.

You ain't getting
itchy, are you, baby?

03:26.440 --> 03:28.240
No. Of course not.

you know that.

We got a good

I don't want to

You are my world,

physical evidence
do we have

04:35.476 --> 04:36.775
From heather clarke's
place?

04:36.777 --> 04:38.977
Nypd found prints

04:38.979 --> 04:40.946
That match the ones
the found at her apartment.

laughter, music,
male singing.

04:54.628 --> 04:55.827
And no sexual assault?

04:55.829 --> 04:57.129
No this
isn't sexual.

It's an intimate

the subway murders.

It's the anniversary

They miss their

the world know,

05:08.542 --> 05:10.309
But the girl
on the park bench

05:10.311 --> 05:12.678
Is a specific message.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.180
The girl reading
on a park bench.

05:15.182 --> 05:17.215
It occurred in
gwendolyn's memory

05:17.217 --> 05:18.717
In carroll's book
"the gothic sea,"

05:18.719 --> 05:24.856
Where carroll wrote
of loneliness, isolation
and solitude.

05:24.858 --> 05:25.857
You look surprised.

05:25.859 --> 05:28.660
I did my dissertation
on carroll at the academy

05:28.662 --> 05:29.561
Just like you.

05:29.563 --> 05:30.896
Now what I don't understand

05:30.898 --> 05:32.931
Is why they haven't
made contact.

05:32.933 --> 05:35.000
I mean, they've got
the whole world watching,

05:35.002 --> 05:39.871
And these kind of murders
come with bragging rights.

05:39.873 --> 05:43.742

07:24.978 --> 07:26.711
Of course. What did you

think I know him?

Well, you're the only
surviving witness,

09:32.072 --> 09:34.773
So it's strictly
job procedure to ask why.

But you're no longer
with the fbi, right?

09:40.647 --> 09:43.315

online. Heh.

I-I knew very little

and his cult.

09:50.457 --> 09:53.091
I was abroad
most of last year,

09:53.093 --> 09:56.194

26:24.183 --> 26:26.150
It's gwendolyn's parents
living under the same roof

26:26.152 --> 26:29.086
But isolated, disconnected
from each other.

26:29.088 --> 26:31.922
But hidden within these
tableaus, the killers'
own pathology

26:31.924 --> 26:33.123
Is starting to emerge.

26:33.125 --> 26:34.325
Spent time with them
post-mortem

26:34.327 --> 26:35.859
Just like heather clarke
the dancer.

26:35.861 --> 26:37.261
This time they're
playing house,

26:37.263 --> 26:39.129
Creating
a family dynamic.

26:39.131 --> 26:41.465
Hey, ryan!

26:46.871 --> 26:51.275
[cell phone ringing]

26:51.277 --> 26:51.842
Hello.

26:51.844 --> 26:53.844
Luke: How'd it go
at the crime scene?

26:53.846 --> 26:57.181
Did they find lots
of prints and dna?

26:57.183 --> 26:58.115
Does it matter, luke?

26:58.117 --> 27:01.652
They won't identify you
because you don't
exist, do you, luke?

27:01.654 --> 27:03.220
I saw what you did
to that family.

27:03.222 --> 27:07.291
The "gothic sea"
symbolism was
a bit obvious,

27:07.293 --> 27:09.193
But it goes deeper
than that.

27:09.195 --> 27:14.064
You're lonely,
and you're searching
for an identity.

27:14.066 --> 27:14.732
Am I warm?

27:14.734 --> 27:17.201
You think that if you
lure joe out of hiding

27:17.203 --> 27:22.072
He will magically
become the father
that you never had.

27:22.074 --> 27:27.411
Wow. Just wow!
That's--that's impressive.

27:27.413 --> 27:30.180
So insightful, mr. Death.

27:30.182 --> 27:31.849
Since we're talking
identity,

27:31.851 --> 27:33.517
Everyone around you dies.

27:33.519 --> 27:35.686
You know
all about lonely.

27:35.688 --> 27:37.855
Did I touch on something
too personal?

27:37.857 --> 27:38.589
I'm sorry.

27:38.591 --> 27:41.759
You know, I bet
claire's death hurt.

27:41.761 --> 27:45.095
Well, too bad,
but it's nice to see you

27:45.097 --> 27:47.064
Getting back out
there again.

27:47.066 --> 27:50.334
You really have a thing
for blonds.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.169
I don't know what
you're talking about.

27:52.171 --> 27:53.604
We followed you, ryan.

27:53.606 --> 27:58.342
We know you're crushing
on a certain blond
art dealer from soho,

27:58.344 --> 28:02.846
The little victim
that got away.

28:02.848 --> 28:05.516
[sighs]

28:05.518 --> 28:09.687
She looks lovely in red.

28:09.689 --> 28:12.523
I'd hurry if I were you.

28:17.295 --> 28:20.097
So what are we
watching?

28:20.099 --> 28:22.566
We had enough
of the tv for--

28:22.568 --> 28:23.634
...A desire to belong.

28:23.636 --> 28:25.302
Carroll manipulated
that desire to get...

28:25.304 --> 28:27.304
It's horrible stuff,
ain't it?

28:27.306 --> 28:28.939
Because of his followers'
admiration,

28:28.941 --> 28:31.208
Carroll's ego grew
and eventually led

28:31.210 --> 28:32.476
To his demise.

28:32.478 --> 28:34.211
You see, carroll believed
himself to be

28:34.213 --> 28:36.213
A grand
and visionary author...

28:36.215 --> 28:37.314
Yep, sure is.

28:37.316 --> 28:38.882
That's why we've
had enough.

28:38.884 --> 28:39.883
He was a lousy writer

28:39.885 --> 28:42.386
And an even
lousier husband.

28:46.891 --> 28:52.229
Well...If judy ain't
coming home soon,

28:52.231 --> 28:54.431
I guess I'll mosey.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.967
Sure you don't want
to just hang around
for a while?

28:56.969 --> 28:58.102
I appreciate the offer,

28:58.104 --> 29:02.339
But I got a sermon
to write.

29:13.084 --> 29:13.751
He knows.

29:13.753 --> 29:15.185
[normal voice]
I think you're right.

29:15.187 --> 29:16.754
Damn. Let me deal
with this.

29:16.756 --> 29:17.988
No, joe.
Don't hurt him.

29:17.990 --> 29:19.523
[southern accent]
excuse me, reverend.

29:19.525 --> 29:21.925
Can I have
a moment, please?

29:28.299 --> 29:29.933
Hey. Hold on now.

29:29.935 --> 29:33.203
Get out! Get out!

29:35.240 --> 29:37.307
Mandy: Hey, reverend.

30:02.801 --> 30:05.669
[normal voice]
oh. Finally
you're awake.

30:05.671 --> 30:07.805
You have presented
us with quite

30:07.807 --> 30:10.307
The conundrum,
reverend.

30:10.309 --> 30:14.578
I feel as if you
forced my hand.

30:14.580 --> 30:18.081
Dear god!
It's really you.

30:18.083 --> 30:20.651
Please, joe.
Don't kill him.

30:20.653 --> 30:23.554
Help me, dear.
Untie me.

30:23.556 --> 30:26.423
You see, the trouble is
I-I-I just don't know

30:26.425 --> 30:28.592
What to do with you.

30:28.594 --> 30:31.228
I barely know what
to do with me. Heh.

30:31.230 --> 30:33.831
I've been stuck
in this--phew--

30:33.833 --> 30:38.902
Dystopian squalor
for--for a year now.

30:38.904 --> 30:44.408
In fact, I-I-I'm rather
off my--off my game.

30:44.410 --> 30:47.744
Granted, it has been
good to have the time

30:47.746 --> 30:50.547
To, uh, to reflect,

30:50.549 --> 30:54.518
But all I've been doing
is hiding my failures

30:54.520 --> 31:01.091
While wallowing in a pit
of clinical depression.

31:01.093 --> 31:05.929
Best laid plans
and all that.

31:05.931 --> 31:07.397
See, I failed.

31:07.399 --> 31:12.469
Yeah. I failed as a writer,
I failed as a husband,

31:12.471 --> 31:15.038
And I failed--

31:15.040 --> 31:18.709
I failed as a father.

31:21.212 --> 31:26.250
These are not
easy things for me...

31:26.252 --> 31:29.786
To admit to you, reverend.

31:29.788 --> 31:34.591
You said you--you would
listen to me.

31:34.593 --> 31:39.963
You said you would help me.

31:39.965 --> 31:44.234
Now is the time.

31:46.504 --> 31:48.739
Now is the time.

31:51.542 --> 31:54.177
Help me.

31:56.114 --> 32:01.518
What am I to do, rev, hmm?

32:02.420 --> 32:06.924
Am I gonna kill you
or not?

32:12.530 --> 32:14.598
Lily: Again, thank you so much
for coming here tonight.

32:14.600 --> 32:18.168
Let's raise a lot of money
for this wonderful cause.

32:18.170 --> 32:19.836
Thank you.

32:31.582 --> 32:34.151
[cell phone ringing]

32:34.153 --> 32:35.385
Mark:
You got here fast.

32:35.387 --> 32:36.720
Did you run
the whole way?

32:36.722 --> 32:39.056
Don't worry about it.
I'm here now.

32:39.058 --> 32:41.358
So how about you leave
the lady alone

32:41.360 --> 32:42.125
And come after me?

32:42.127 --> 32:43.226
I'm the one
you really want.

32:43.228 --> 32:46.196
Well, yeah, but killing
her would get you.

32:46.198 --> 32:47.664
Guilt kills ryan.

32:47.666 --> 32:50.467
I mean, you must blame
yourself for claire's death.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.235
How do you sleep at night?

32:52.237 --> 32:54.137
That's what's
motivates you.

32:54.139 --> 32:55.639
You really think
that if you can save

32:55.641 --> 32:58.508
All the world's victims that
will ease your suffering.

32:58.510 --> 33:01.211
I think killing you would.

33:05.283 --> 33:08.652
It's nice to
officially meet you.

33:25.536 --> 33:28.905
See that? I told you
it would be quick
and painless.

33:28.907 --> 33:30.073
Sweetie, I'm exhausted.

33:30.075 --> 33:31.575
Can we just go
right now?

33:31.577 --> 33:32.409
Of course.
Thank you.

33:32.411 --> 33:34.878
The car's waiting
in the back.

33:37.949 --> 33:39.750
Hey. How many agents
on the scene?

33:39.752 --> 33:41.451
I don't know what
you're talking about.

33:41.453 --> 33:43.020
You're fbi.
Don't pretend you're not.

33:43.022 --> 33:44.287
We got a situation here.

33:44.289 --> 33:45.622
How many?

33:45.624 --> 33:46.790
3 including myself.

33:46.792 --> 33:48.091
You need to find
lily gray,

33:48.093 --> 33:51.361
Make sure she's
secure now.

33:54.032 --> 33:54.931
This way.

33:54.933 --> 33:58.301
I'll have you home
before you know it.

34:03.508 --> 34:05.409
Down here.

34:27.565 --> 34:30.266
It's just
around this way.

34:33.771 --> 34:35.672
Wait.

34:37.574 --> 34:41.578
Who is that?
Hello?

34:41.580 --> 34:43.847
Who are you?

34:53.024 --> 34:55.125
He was
in the subway!

34:55.127 --> 34:56.760
He was in the subway!

34:56.762 --> 34:58.695
This way!

34:59.864 --> 35:02.299
[gasps]

35:02.301 --> 35:04.468
Stay behind me.

35:06.737 --> 35:09.172
Run! Aah!

35:14.779 --> 35:16.613
Help!

Aah!

35:17.316 --> 35:20.283
Shh. It's ok.
It's me, it's me.

35:20.285 --> 35:21.051
They're here,

35:21.053 --> 35:23.720
The people
from the subway.

35:23.722 --> 35:24.688
They took david.

35:24.690 --> 35:25.822
Fbi, ms. Gray!

35:25.824 --> 35:26.823
Get ms. Gray secure!

35:26.825 --> 35:29.693
It's ok. It's ok.
They're fbi.

35:29.695 --> 35:30.494
Keep her safe.

35:30.496 --> 35:32.496
You're gonna be fine.

35:33.264 --> 35:37.534
David: Ryan. Help.

Luke: Hey, ryan!

36:10.701 --> 36:14.171
Come on. Let's go. Luke.

36:14.173 --> 36:16.039
Surprised, huh?

36:25.550 --> 36:28.418
Ok. Hang on.
Hang in there.

36:28.420 --> 36:31.221
Hang in there,
hang in.

36:32.957 --> 36:34.191
Luke, you're
bleeding.

36:34.193 --> 36:35.859
Damn straight!
I've just been shot.

36:35.861 --> 36:39.696
Damn that ryan hardy.
He shot me. Ha ha ha!

36:39.698 --> 36:42.532
Come on. Let's go!

36:42.534 --> 36:45.769
[rock music playing]

36:52.710 --> 36:54.477
Mendez: Traffic cams
caught them leaving
in a car.

36:54.479 --> 36:55.745
They taped over
the license plates.

36:55.747 --> 36:57.080
They know how
to avoid cameras.

36:57.082 --> 36:58.081
What happened
to the man?

36:58.083 --> 36:59.249
David roland.
He's gonna be ok.

36:59.251 --> 37:01.818
Paramedics are taking
him to memorial hospital.

37:01.820 --> 37:04.454
Ms. Gray will be
under tight security.

37:04.456 --> 37:06.323
Excuse me.

37:07.592 --> 37:09.626
Hey. Give us a minute.

37:09.628 --> 37:10.727
Yeah.

37:10.729 --> 37:12.095
You screwed up tonight.

37:12.097 --> 37:13.463
But you had agents here.
Good move.

37:13.465 --> 37:15.832
She was the only
surviving witness, ryan.

37:15.834 --> 37:16.566
She was a target.

37:16.568 --> 37:17.834
Of course we were
gonna watch her,

37:17.836 --> 37:19.803
But you--what are
you doing here?

37:19.805 --> 37:21.671
They--they called me.
They're engaging me.

37:21.673 --> 37:25.842
So you call us.
Hey. Call me.

37:25.844 --> 37:27.277
Engage the fbi.
You almost got

37:27.279 --> 37:28.778
Two people killed
tonight.

37:28.780 --> 37:29.913
I'm sorry.

37:29.915 --> 37:30.981
No. You want to get
these guys so bad,

37:30.983 --> 37:33.783
You don't care
who gets hurt.

37:33.785 --> 37:36.086
What happened to you?

37:38.422 --> 37:40.090
Hey.

37:40.092 --> 37:42.959
You're looking
for brothers, ok,
identical twins.

37:42.961 --> 37:43.526
I can I.D.--

37:43.528 --> 37:46.196
Tell it to mendez.
I'm done with you.

38:01.712 --> 38:02.879
Hey.

38:02.881 --> 38:04.547
Hi.

38:04.549 --> 38:06.516
I have to go see
david at the hospital.

38:06.518 --> 38:07.817
I could take you.

38:07.819 --> 38:10.353
Thank you.

38:10.355 --> 38:12.956
I'm sorry about tonight.

38:12.958 --> 38:14.624
Why are you
apologizing?

38:14.626 --> 38:18.628
I took risks
with your safety.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.530
I was reckless.

38:20.532 --> 38:22.532
You saved my life.

38:22.534 --> 38:23.967
If you hadn't
been here--

38:23.969 --> 38:25.702
My judgment was clouded,

38:25.704 --> 38:28.872
And I put you in danger.

38:28.874 --> 38:32.909
No. You saved david.

38:32.911 --> 38:35.645
You helped.

38:35.647 --> 38:37.814

38:50.628 --> 38:52.896
[metal scrapes]

38:52.898 --> 38:56.566
Human beings
can rise above their
instincts, joe.

38:56.568 --> 38:58.568
The fact that
you're struggling
with your choices

38:58.570 --> 39:02.605
Is proof
of your humanity,
your goodness.

39:02.607 --> 39:04.941
Except there is
no struggle.

39:04.943 --> 39:06.242
There's...

39:06.244 --> 39:07.877
There's patience,

39:07.879 --> 39:10.413
But I'm rapidly
running out of that.

39:10.415 --> 39:13.616
You may not be
a religious man,

39:13.618 --> 39:15.418
But you're
an intelligent one,

39:15.420 --> 39:17.020
A philosophical one.

39:17.022 --> 39:22.258
Socrates tells us
that we cannot
be better

39:22.260 --> 39:25.128
Than in seeking
to become better.

39:25.130 --> 39:29.766
But he also tells us
that death may be

39:29.768 --> 39:33.603
The greatest
of all human blessings.

39:33.605 --> 39:34.871
Joe, don't.

the trouble is

I was gonna be reborn,

39:41.446 --> 39:44.280

39:44.282 --> 39:46.983
But the reality is that...

I am inevitable.
