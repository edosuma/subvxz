00:18.007 --> 00:20.642

nut out in some road beef

00:20.643 --> 00:23.244
was punishable by caskration
in the "Game of Thrones" era.

00:23.246 --> 00:24.578

Black People Skeet app

00:24.580 --> 00:26.046

10:33.689 --> 10:36.490
We some legends,
and if you come to our room,

10:36.492 --> 10:38.325
we'll show you
how we finger roll.

10:38.327 --> 10:40.761
- Uh-uh.
- Nope.

10:40.763 --> 10:43.797
Girl, these dudes is dusty.
They'll never be league.

10:43.799 --> 10:46.333
Where else we gonna go?
At least they got a warm shower,

10:46.335 --> 10:48.135
and we'll figure out a way
to get rid of 'em.

10:48.137 --> 10:49.470
- True.
- Yep.

10:49.472 --> 10:52.239
Well, we can't go home
until it stops hurricaning,

10:52.241 --> 10:56.343
- so we'll come chill.
- Thank you, Hurricane Jermaine.

11:00.716 --> 11:04.551
The guys may be on some bullshit,
but at least the food is on point.

11:04.553 --> 11:08.188
These wings are everything.
Too bad they cold, though.

11:08.190 --> 11:11.992
You should warm your food
up like me. Almost ready.

11:11.994 --> 11:15.462
Aw, damn.
Did somebody run over a skunk?

11:15.464 --> 11:17.765
Yeah, it smells like
someone's allergic to meat.

11:17.767 --> 11:22.936
Uh... I got a call to make.
I'll be right back.

11:24.907 --> 11:28.609
Have you placed your bet yet?

11:28.611 --> 11:31.678
- Bets for what?
- For the Slump Busting.

11:31.680 --> 11:34.916
See, look, we find the fattest girl
for the pledge to smash.

11:34.917 --> 11:36.049
Us bros hide in the closet,

11:36.051 --> 11:38.769
<i>and when we jump out and she
tries to escape, the pledge</i>

11:38.770 --> 11:41.488
<i>has to hold on to her for
eight seconds. It is hilarious.</i>

11:41.490 --> 11:45.893
Say, bro, are you okay?
It smells real bad.

11:45.895 --> 11:49.496
<i> I got Crohn's disease, nigga.</i>

11:49.498 --> 11:51.198
They're gonna try to run
a train on Medina

11:51.200 --> 11:54.234
- and embarrass her, y'all.
- Aw, that's messed up.

11:54.236 --> 11:55.803
<i>Omarion.</i>

11:55.805 --> 11:58.505
<i>Formation.</i>

11:58.507 --> 11:59.473
We should probably help her.

11:59.475 --> 12:02.309
<i>Slump Busters, to the throne!</i>

12:04.613 --> 12:06.413
Well, you know, good for her.

12:06.415 --> 12:07.614
I guess there's somebody
for everybody.

12:07.616 --> 12:09.650
I can't believe you, Cindy.

12:09.652 --> 12:12.453
Medina's about to lose
all her self-respect

12:12.455 --> 12:15.289
and dignity to a pack of Omarions

12:15.291 --> 12:18.725
- and all you can think about is yourself.
- But what can we do now?

12:18.727 --> 12:21.039
Looks like the train
already left the station.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.730
All aboard, mother[bleep]!

12:23.732 --> 12:25.265
Maybe we can drug 'em.

12:25.267 --> 12:27.801
They can't run a train when
they're all asleep, right?

12:27.803 --> 12:32.806
- Where you gonna get that many drugs?
- Fine.

12:32.808 --> 12:35.642
Take whatever you want,
but the crack rock is mine.

12:35.644 --> 12:37.511
<i>So what y'all trying to do?</i>

12:37.513 --> 12:39.112
Yeah, should we do
one of them draft lotteries

12:39.114 --> 12:41.515
to see who smashing who
or just hit the lights

12:41.517 --> 12:42.816
and get on that
natural selection?

12:42.818 --> 12:45.219
How about this?
We'll take off these wet clothes

12:45.221 --> 12:47.754
and hop in the shower and
y'all go put on some rubbers,

12:47.756 --> 12:51.191
and we'll show you
what these stank holes do.

12:51.193 --> 12:51.892
<i>Rubbers?</i>

12:51.894 --> 12:54.328
Y'all got some condoms, right?

12:54.330 --> 12:57.364
Nah, we some real-league types.
We only go raw.

12:57.366 --> 12:58.732
Sorry, boos.
Y'all ain't starters.

12:58.734 --> 13:03.504
- No jimmy hat, no kitty cat.
- No strap, no stroke.

13:03.506 --> 13:06.988
- No latex, no anal.
- Girl, you dumb.

13:07.023 --> 13:09.009
Get your ass in this bathroom.

13:09.011 --> 13:12.179
The only way we dunking
our balls in they cups is

13:12.181 --> 13:15.048
- if we get some straps.
- We can hit the store right there.

13:15.050 --> 13:17.784
I don't know, y'all.
This hurricane ain't no buster.

13:17.786 --> 13:19.319
It's flooding pretty bad out there

13:19.321 --> 13:21.488
- and I can't swim.
- Hold up, Grover.

13:21.490 --> 13:24.358
Are you really gonna let
a category 6 hurricane

13:24.360 --> 13:29.029
- keep us from smashing?
- Yeah, it's barely bigger than Katrina.

13:32.034 --> 13:34.635
[bleep] it, Hurricane Jermaine
can't fade the legend.

13:36.539 --> 13:40.707
Yo... this wind...
is scarier...

13:40.709 --> 13:43.367
than Draymond Green's dick pic.

13:44.847 --> 13:46.280
We almost there, my dudes.

13:46.282 --> 13:49.082
It's actually about to happen.
Thanks, LeBron.

13:50.419 --> 13:53.453
I love you guys, man.

13:53.455 --> 13:55.656
<i> Oh, shit!</i>

13:55.658 --> 13:57.391
God damn levies!

14:08.009 --> 14:11.744
- Hey, let's jump on that L.
- We ain't taking no L, buster.

14:11.746 --> 14:13.623
That's what they want us to do.

14:13.658 --> 14:15.748
- You smart.
- Come on, y'all.

14:15.750 --> 14:19.018
If we don't hop on this L,
we gon' take one.

14:19.020 --> 14:20.887
Oh, shit, we losing ground.

14:24.225 --> 14:27.493
Yo, Grover,
if we get merced out here,

14:27.495 --> 14:30.229
you think they'll give us
a Facebook tribute page?

14:30.231 --> 14:32.164
Hopefully LeBron will see our story

14:32.166 --> 14:36.262
- and pay for our funeral.
- Man, [bleep].

14:39.407 --> 14:41.674
Hop on, my dudes.

14:43.778 --> 14:45.511
Damn, Milk,
how come you never told us

14:45.513 --> 14:48.281
your Michael Phelps game is
so strong?

14:48.283 --> 14:49.515
[bleep] that white boy.

14:49.517 --> 14:51.793
Y'all better not tell nobody
I can swim.

14:52.787 --> 14:55.454
For real, though, Milk,
this is unanimous decision.

14:55.456 --> 14:57.521
Since you saved our lives,
you can say "nig"

14:57.556 --> 15:00.426
- for the rest of the road trip.
- Hold up. For real?

15:00.428 --> 15:03.963
- It's a new day in Civil Rights.
- Appreciate you...

15:03.965 --> 15:06.132
my nig!

15:06.134 --> 15:08.601
So beautiful.

15:08.603 --> 15:11.570
Now, lets go get
our mother[bleep] nuts.

15:19.847 --> 15:23.416
Aw, damn,
did one of you guys wet fart?

15:23.418 --> 15:24.550
Whoever smelt it dealt it,

15:24.552 --> 15:28.087
- stinky booty boy.
- Ah, was it you, Hoffart?

15:28.089 --> 15:31.357
Where the [bleep] is it
coming from then? It stinks.

15:32.927 --> 15:36.395
Oh, man, Randy, somebody took a
little boo-boo-booie in your Louie.

15:36.397 --> 15:40.099
Aw, not the Louie!
Aw, the shit crew is dead!

15:43.771 --> 15:46.739
I think LeBron just saying
it wasn't meant to be on this trip.

15:46.741 --> 15:48.625
I can't believe this, man.

15:48.660 --> 15:54.480
Please, God, just caskrate these balls
 and get it over with.

15:58.486 --> 16:00.052
What the [bleep] is this nig doing?

16:01.155 --> 16:02.488
Oh, shit, he gon' kill us.

16:02.490 --> 16:05.925
- Oh, shit.
- Yo. What the [bleep]?

16:05.927 --> 16:08.461
It was nice knowing you, my nigs.

16:09.931 --> 16:13.099
Hold up.
Is that Delonte West?

16:13.101 --> 16:14.100
Yeah.

16:17.772 --> 16:19.939
- Appreciate you, Delonte.
- Yeah.

16:19.941 --> 16:23.476
Aye, yo,
where them Jeter sleeves at?

16:23.478 --> 16:27.342
Yo, I got dibs on the maggies.

16:27.582 --> 16:30.082
Mr. West, you are a real one,
my nig.

16:30.084 --> 16:33.319
- Appreciate you, my nig.
- Thanks, my nig.

16:33.321 --> 16:36.422
Planes, trains, or automobiles.

16:36.424 --> 16:39.091
You better have my donuts.

16:39.093 --> 16:41.527
- Aye, what he say?
- Da fwa?

16:41.529 --> 16:43.262
Aye, Delonte,
can I ask you something?

16:43.264 --> 16:46.465
- Yeah.
- Well, uh, yeah, see.

16:46.467 --> 16:48.134
I heard a rumor that...
did you, like, uh...

16:48.136 --> 16:52.838
Did you [bleep] LeBron's
mom or what, man?

16:52.840 --> 16:55.741
Yeah.

16:55.743 --> 16:56.909
<i> Legend.</i>

16:56.911 --> 16:59.311
All right, it's game time, my nigs.

16:59.313 --> 17:02.715
What? Failing to prepare
is preparing to fail.

17:02.717 --> 17:06.852
- That's a great call.
- You a genius, my nig.

17:21.736 --> 17:25.271
Come on, y'all. A bitch
ready to get her slump busted.

17:28.743 --> 17:32.011
What the [bleep]?

17:33.881 --> 17:36.248
Open up, shit crew!
I know you're in there!

17:36.250 --> 17:40.219
Whoa, the shit crew actually had
some things lined up.

17:40.221 --> 17:41.720
Where are those turd nuggets at, anyway?

17:41.722 --> 17:44.723
They went to the store, but
they been gone a cool minute.

17:44.725 --> 17:46.525
- Who is y'all niggas?
- Oh, us?

17:46.527 --> 17:49.195
Oh, who we's be?
Oh, we's be the stars

17:49.197 --> 17:50.663
of the Duncan basketball team,
sweet thang.

17:50.665 --> 17:55.768
- Oh, okay. Come inside.
- Also enter.

17:55.770 --> 17:57.570
But we don't got straps.

17:57.572 --> 18:00.372
<i>You're starters.
You don't need straps.</i>

18:01.609 --> 18:04.477
Somebody roofied all my dick, y'all.

18:04.479 --> 18:06.112
We did it, Medina.
Can't you see?

18:06.114 --> 18:08.414
They were just using you
for a hazing ritual.

18:08.416 --> 18:10.216
God knows they didn't
want you for you.

18:10.218 --> 18:12.585
You think I didn't know
what was going on?!

18:12.587 --> 18:14.386
They weren't gonna
run a train on me.

18:14.388 --> 18:16.889
I was gonna run a train
on them, and you nosey,

18:16.890 --> 18:19.391
malnourished heifers
unempowered a bitch.

18:19.393 --> 18:21.927

- What y'all doing with our breezys?
- What does it look like we're doing?

19:07.108 --> 19:09.408
We're shucking your clams
bareback.

19:09.410 --> 19:11.377
Unlike you guys, we get burn.

19:11.379 --> 19:13.379
Oh, man, seriously,
it's a little bit more of a itch

19:13.381 --> 19:14.413
- than a burn.
- Come on, Randy.

19:14.415 --> 19:16.282
How you just gonna slide
in our work like that?

19:16.284 --> 19:18.817
We wasn't really even tripping
on the hazing, but damn.

19:18.819 --> 19:20.719
This right here just
ain't being a good teammate.

19:20.721 --> 19:23.055
You wanna talk about
not being a good teammate?

19:23.057 --> 19:25.291
Which one of you guys
one-pieced in my Louie?

19:25.293 --> 19:27.826
How dare you downgrade it
to a one-piece.

19:27.828 --> 19:30.596
I clipped off a perfect Nike swoosh.

19:30.598 --> 19:32.731
All right, fine. I'll pass
the ball around a little bit.

19:32.733 --> 19:35.301
You guys wanna join in?

19:35.303 --> 19:36.602
Here, take the other end.

19:36.604 --> 19:38.120
<i>This nigga.</i>

19:49.027 --> 19:51.827
I can't believe these hoes
had the audacity

19:51.829 --> 19:52.995
- to show up at the game.
- That's right.

19:52.997 --> 19:56.532
- Go Duncan!
- Let's go, Randy!

19:56.534 --> 19:57.933
At least we still got
a few days left

19:57.935 --> 20:00.369
- to try and get our nuts.
- Not happening, my dude.

20:00.371 --> 20:02.771
Everyone in town
know we suck now.

20:02.773 --> 20:05.307
It's a cold game, my...

20:05.309 --> 20:06.775
nigs.
Hee-hee.

20:06.777 --> 20:08.777
Damn, I thought
for the rest of the trip

20:08.779 --> 20:11.680
I was free to say "nig"?
Ooh.

20:11.682 --> 20:14.016
Unfortch, your nig pass was revoked

20:14.018 --> 20:16.318
after Randy and them snatched
our scrallywags last night.

20:16.320 --> 20:19.488
Yep, that word is back
on the banned substance list.

20:19.490 --> 20:24.660
- Man, y'all some damn renegers.
- Shit, he found a loophole.

20:24.662 --> 20:28.297
I'm frigging...

20:28.299 --> 20:31.457
I guess that's what happens when
you don't strap up on road trips.

20:35.373 --> 20:37.072
Aw, hell no.

20:40.344 --> 20:42.912
- Milk, you know what to do.
- Way ahead of you.
