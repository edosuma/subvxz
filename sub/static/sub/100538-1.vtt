00:01.268 --> 00:03.335
(liquid pours)

00:08.943 --> 00:09.675
(clink)

00:28.729 --> 00:35.801
¶ ¶ ¶

01:18.813 --> 01:20.612
Block Island, baby!

01:20.614 --> 01:21.280
Yeah!

01:21.282 --> 01:24.683
Let's go! It's on man.

01:30.758 --> 01:33.358
I got it, I got it.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.427
So what'd you do
in rehab Ashley?

01:35.429 --> 01:38.797
Smoked cigarettes.
Practiced mindfulness.

01:40.101 --> 01:41.300
Oh you don't mind, do you?

01:41.302 --> 01:43.302
Hey no need to flaunt
that in her face Nicky.

01:43.304 --> 01:45.938
What?
No, I don't mind.

01:53.781 --> 01:54.880
Alright how far to the ferry?

01:54.882 --> 01:56.415
About twenty minutes
if we're lucky.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.317
But we're cutting it close.

01:58.319 --> 02:01.120
Alright, Big Man pull over,
I gotta take a leak.

02:01.122 --> 02:02.187
No way.

02:03.324 --> 02:05.157
Dude, come on, I gotta go.

02:05.159 --> 02:07.126
You want to get to this
party tonight or not?

02:08.996 --> 02:10.729
Ashley, give me
an empty beer can.

02:11.966 --> 02:14.466
Please, thank you.

02:14.468 --> 02:15.767
That's right.

02:15.769 --> 02:17.035
Turn that way
when you do it.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.240
Whoa!

02:21.242 --> 02:23.942
Get your loafer off me man.

02:28.048 --> 02:29.815
You watch that Big Man, alright.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.316
Careful Duker.

02:31.318 --> 02:33.385
You dribble one drop
in my Dad's car

02:33.387 --> 02:34.653
I'm going to give
you a beat down.

02:34.655 --> 02:38.657
Hey relax, I've got
pin point accuracy.

02:39.193 --> 02:40.726
Disgusting.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.427
Ah, yeah.

02:52.239 --> 02:57.176
¶ ¶ ¶

03:21.735 --> 03:23.835
Oh come on, come on, come on.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.442
Dude! Is there another boat?

03:30.444 --> 03:32.411
The next one leaves
tomorrow morning.

03:32.413 --> 03:33.545
Wait so that's it?

03:33.547 --> 03:34.480
I don't understand.

03:34.481 --> 03:35.414
How can they just
leave without us?

03:35.416 --> 03:36.632
Way to go, Big Man.

03:36.633 --> 03:37.849
How we supposed to get
to the party now?

03:37.851 --> 03:38.850
How is this my fault?

03:38.852 --> 03:41.720
You drive like my
grandmother, who's dead!

03:41.722 --> 03:42.854
You're dead!

03:46.293 --> 03:47.426
You can find a way to get us to

03:47.428 --> 03:48.994
Block Island tonight,
right Jake?

03:48.996 --> 03:50.696
Yeah man,
this is life or death.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.731
Shut up!

03:52.732 --> 03:54.765
I'll call Harry, maybe he can
find us a ride on his boat.

03:56.437 --> 03:58.503
¶ ¶ ¶

04:05.779 --> 04:09.815
(Phone ringing)

04:13.687 --> 04:15.120
Hello.

04:15.122 --> 04:18.824
Harley boy!
You on the slow boat?

04:18.826 --> 04:22.160
What? I can't hear you man.

04:22.162 --> 04:24.429
Here, listen to
this party stuff.

04:28.035 --> 04:30.269
Just a quick flash.
Just show me.

04:30.271 --> 04:32.404
Yes, aw titties!

04:32.406 --> 04:33.772
No...

04:33.774 --> 04:35.073
Gosh!

04:35.075 --> 04:38.110
Hang on a sec Jake,
I gotta refill my glass.

04:42.449 --> 04:46.118
Okay no one look, I have to
put in my secret ingredient

04:46.120 --> 04:50.255
on my signature drink:
Harry's High Tide.

04:53.060 --> 04:55.927
Elvis, throw me that kiwi, yeah?

04:55.929 --> 04:57.929
Thanks, hound dog.

05:04.438 --> 05:06.238
And get ready to straddle.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.006
Okay, three, two, one, okay.

05:10.377 --> 05:12.210
Everything okay Baker?

05:12.212 --> 05:14.780
Anything you need,
just, just help yourself.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.782
Hey thanks Harry,
this has been amazing

05:16.784 --> 05:18.450
but I gotta get back to work.

05:18.452 --> 05:21.253
So do me a favor just
keep the noise level down.

05:21.255 --> 05:22.254
I don't want to have
to deal with your

05:22.256 --> 05:23.455
annoying neighbors, okay.

05:23.457 --> 05:25.691
Okay, thanks man.

05:27.227 --> 05:28.427
Who's got my handcuffs?

05:40.307 --> 05:42.307
Harry?

05:42.309 --> 05:44.443
Yo. Sorry about that.

05:44.445 --> 05:46.144
There's a girl in a bikini

05:46.146 --> 05:49.047
doing back-flips across
the backyard for you.

05:49.049 --> 05:52.417
We're still in New London,
The ferry left without us.

05:52.419 --> 05:54.820
Not your best move Harley.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.355
We know.

05:56.357 --> 06:01.026
So, uh, what are
you going to do?

06:01.028 --> 06:02.694
Well it's funny you should ask.

06:02.696 --> 06:03.895
We were actually hoping that,

06:03.897 --> 06:06.798
maybe you could hop in your
boat and come pick us up?

06:11.105 --> 06:15.807
Ah, Jake. You know
you're my boy, I mean,

06:15.809 --> 06:18.143
no one wants to see
you here more than me,

06:18.145 --> 06:21.980
but I'm already deep
into some High Tides,

06:21.982 --> 06:26.818
and my buzz is way too
large for me to handle

06:26.820 --> 06:30.489
a mish, a misha,
mission like that.

06:30.491 --> 06:33.291
We got no other way
over there tonight, Harry.

06:33.293 --> 06:36.294
I hear you brother
but it looks like you're

06:36.296 --> 06:37.829
gonna have to get creative.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.164
Check the docks.

06:39.166 --> 06:42.167
I've hitched rides
from hedge fund guys

06:42.169 --> 06:44.736
on their yachts
a few times before.

06:44.738 --> 06:49.241
If not the docks,
check with one of the locals.

06:49.243 --> 06:50.041
Harry?

06:50.043 --> 06:51.309
Hi baby.
Good luck brother.

06:51.311 --> 06:52.978
Call me when you get there.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.146
What's that sweetheart?

06:55.349 --> 06:56.848
Great!

06:59.820 --> 07:01.787
This place is dead.

07:01.789 --> 07:04.289
Where are those hedge fund
yachts Harry was talking about?

07:04.291 --> 07:07.225
I'm sure this is where all
the hitters park their boats.

07:10.898 --> 07:13.198
I got Fireball...

07:13.200 --> 07:14.466
Screw this.

07:14.468 --> 07:15.434
Where you going?

07:15.436 --> 07:16.968
Going to salvage this situation.

07:16.970 --> 07:20.172
Hey Big Boy!
Boys?

07:20.174 --> 07:22.073
Boys!

07:22.075 --> 07:23.775
Gotta love New London hookers!

07:23.777 --> 07:24.910
Hoookaaahhhs!

07:24.912 --> 07:26.044
Hey guys!

07:26.046 --> 07:27.779
Harry said we should
ask some locals.

07:27.781 --> 07:28.947
Local hookers!

07:30.451 --> 07:33.718
I don't want any incidents!

07:37.057 --> 07:38.757
I know but he hasn't called.

07:38.759 --> 07:39.858
You know what I mean.

07:39.860 --> 07:43.028
Guess who's always
getting whacked, you.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.363
So that's what's keeping him.

07:45.365 --> 07:46.364
(laughing)

08:06.086 --> 08:08.320
Look at this place Big Man.

08:08.322 --> 08:10.956
Maybe we can still get to
that party tonight after all.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.157
What do you mean?

08:12.159 --> 08:14.326
Well I'm sure one
of these locals

08:14.328 --> 08:16.261
has a boat we can charter.

08:16.263 --> 08:21.132
Throw some green, become heroes
of the working class, no?

08:24.037 --> 08:25.737
Try not to think too much.

08:26.807 --> 08:29.140
What kind of beer you got here?

08:29.142 --> 08:30.408
The usual.

08:30.410 --> 08:31.676
I'll take two of those.

08:35.883 --> 08:37.249
You're in my seat.

08:42.956 --> 08:46.057
Hey bartender, can I get um,

08:46.059 --> 08:48.226
can I get a pitcher
of whatever you guys got,

08:48.228 --> 08:51.162
and let me get four
shots of anything brown.

08:51.164 --> 08:53.198
Open up a tab for me boss.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.466
Cash only.

08:56.870 --> 08:57.936
Got it.

09:01.408 --> 09:03.041
We should probably
head to the bar

09:03.043 --> 09:04.809
before those two burn it down.

09:04.811 --> 09:06.845
Sure you're ready
for all this, Ash?

09:06.847 --> 09:11.249
Well my sponsor says I need to
"assimilate" sooner or later.

09:11.251 --> 09:14.452
Just seems a little
on the sooner side.

09:14.454 --> 09:16.488
Maybe you should
worry about yourself.

09:16.490 --> 09:17.789
Ashley-

09:17.791 --> 09:20.225
No, I needed you
that night Jake.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.227
I overreacted with your father.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.895
You attacked him.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.297
I wasn't thinking.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.200
You scared me, Jake.

09:31.338 --> 09:33.038
I'm sorry.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.375
That's not enough.

09:44.351 --> 09:45.917
Come on.

09:56.763 --> 09:59.064
You kids don't
want to go in there.

09:59.066 --> 10:02.834
We've got friends in there.

10:02.836 --> 10:05.103
Don't say I didn't warn ya.

10:09.343 --> 10:10.775
Stay close.

10:32.032 --> 10:34.366
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

10:42.509 --> 10:43.908
Harley boy!

10:45.345 --> 10:46.711
Meet the girls.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.080
This is Nancy.

10:49.082 --> 10:51.483
Brandy.
And this is Alexa.

10:51.485 --> 10:54.219
Hey, Harley boy.

10:54.221 --> 10:56.187
Where's Nicky?

10:56.189 --> 10:58.490
Said he's going to try and
charter a boat or something.

11:18.211 --> 11:19.778
You can do this.

11:25.318 --> 11:27.986
Hey cutie. What's your story?

11:27.988 --> 11:30.121
Let's find Nicky
and get out of here.

11:30.123 --> 11:32.757
You're crushing
the mood here Jake.

11:32.759 --> 11:36.094
Yeah, don't do that.
Let's crush something else.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.896
Have a beer and relax.

11:39.833 --> 11:42.934
I think you're hot.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.135
What's that?

11:46.139 --> 11:50.141
We can all go to my place.
All four of us.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.810
Thanks for the invite.

11:51.812 --> 11:55.280
I don't want to be rude, but
my friends and I are leaving.

11:55.282 --> 11:57.115
Is, is that your girlfriend?

12:02.989 --> 12:05.256
She's not all that, you know?

12:10.897 --> 12:12.230
Excuse me for a second.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.456
Whoa! What's your problem, man!

13:11.458 --> 13:15.493
Ooooh, What's wrong
with you, Chester?

13:15.495 --> 13:17.796
Your name's Chester?

13:17.798 --> 13:19.197
He was all over my girl, Bobby.

13:19.199 --> 13:22.300
I think we all know it
was the other way around.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.169
Why don't you go
home and take a nap.

13:24.171 --> 13:26.437
Yo Chester, why don't
you do us all a favor

13:26.439 --> 13:27.972
and go home and take a nap!

13:27.974 --> 13:29.440
Yeah Chester.

13:29.442 --> 13:33.178
Screw you Bobby.
Screw all of you!

13:33.180 --> 13:35.180
Come on.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.121
Are you okay?

13:43.123 --> 13:45.290
I'm fine. Just took
me by surprise.

13:45.292 --> 13:46.958
You're my boy!

13:46.960 --> 13:48.326
Clean hit.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.961
So good news Jake!

13:49.963 --> 13:53.064
Bobby here is first
mate on a fishing boat,

13:53.066 --> 13:56.067
says he can get us
to Block Island, tonight.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.702
Surprised you didn't
give Chester a beat down

13:57.704 --> 13:59.838
after he took that
free shot on you.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.139
I would've put
him in the ground.

14:01.141 --> 14:03.374
I could tell you
wanted to do the same.

14:03.376 --> 14:08.213
My man. Never second
guess yourself.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.355
You know where you're going?

14:17.357 --> 14:18.857
Yeah, last slip on the dock,
north side.

14:18.859 --> 14:20.491
Boat leaves in thirty.

14:20.493 --> 14:24.128
Later soon, amigos.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.735
Yes.

14:30.737 --> 14:31.436
We got a boat!

14:31.438 --> 14:33.271
Let's go.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.708
Now that is what
I'm talking about.

14:36.710 --> 14:39.911
We needed a ride,
so I got us a ride.

14:39.913 --> 14:41.379
It's called initiative, playa.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.714
I don't like this guy Bobby.

14:42.716 --> 14:44.082
Would you stop overreacting?

14:44.084 --> 14:45.467
Seriously.

14:45.468 --> 14:46.851
I am not spending a night
in this black hole of a town.

14:46.853 --> 14:49.220
I want sex, not bed bugs.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.321
Yeah well good luck with that.

14:50.323 --> 14:51.723
Cause Ashley and
I are staying here.

14:51.725 --> 14:53.091
What?

14:53.093 --> 14:55.293
Did that meat
stick jar your brain?

14:55.295 --> 14:57.328
Dude if it were just the three
of us that would be one thing

14:57.330 --> 14:59.797
but I'm not putting Ashley
on that guy's boat, at night,

14:59.799 --> 15:01.299
in the middle of
Long Island Sound.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.968
Hey Jake, I paid this
guy four hundred bucks.

15:03.970 --> 15:05.870
If you don't want to go?
That's fine don't go.

15:05.872 --> 15:07.305
I'll have plenty of
stories for you on Monday.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.040
Maybe Harley's got
a point, Nicky.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.509
Bobby does seem
a little sketchy.

15:11.511 --> 15:12.911
Alright shut up.

15:12.913 --> 15:14.412
I don't want to miss
another boat cause of you.

15:39.172 --> 15:40.838
Hope you had your shots.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.907
I can't believe that
thing even floats.

15:42.909 --> 15:44.809
Looks like a dinghy
I rowed in on

15:44.811 --> 15:48.246
when I shipwrecked off
Nantucket two summers ago.

15:48.248 --> 15:51.015
I remember that dinghy.

15:53.119 --> 15:56.187
Okay, let's do this.
Hello?

15:56.189 --> 15:57.889
You can't be serious.

15:57.891 --> 15:59.090
This is not what Harry meant

15:59.092 --> 16:01.092
when he said we
could find a ride over.

16:01.094 --> 16:02.727
Officially done
talking about this Jake.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.762
Hello?

16:08.768 --> 16:10.368
Who are you?

16:10.370 --> 16:12.670
It's my boat.
Who the fuck are you?

16:12.672 --> 16:15.974
Ah well, it's, it's a,
it's a very good boat.

16:15.976 --> 16:19.143
It looks uh,
looks sea worthy.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.949
Is Bobby here?

16:24.951 --> 16:27.251
He told us he'd give us a
ride to Block Island tonight.

16:32.726 --> 16:38.262
Cool knife... old.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.539
They're okay Cap.

16:48.541 --> 16:53.177
I'll vouch for 'em.
That's my boy Nicky.

16:54.347 --> 16:57.515
They paid, Stoney.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.118
All we have to do is get them to
a party tonight on Block Island.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.420
Oh, why didn't you say so.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.822
But they have to ask nicely.

17:04.824 --> 17:06.224
And not this one.

17:06.226 --> 17:09.127
I know him two minutes
already I don't like him.

17:09.129 --> 17:12.397
Sir, uh, we'd
really appreciate it

17:12.399 --> 17:15.133
if you could give us a
ride to Block Island tonight.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.268
You'd really help us out?

17:21.241 --> 17:24.008
Brains and beauty.

17:33.486 --> 17:36.320
Get the lines.

17:39.192 --> 17:41.759
Climb aboard.

17:41.761 --> 17:43.494
Well done Nicky!

17:49.869 --> 17:52.203
Ashley.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.914
All clear Stoney!

18:02.916 --> 18:03.915
Harley, you coming or what?

18:03.917 --> 18:06.017
Yeah donkey, get on the boat.

18:06.019 --> 18:07.351
Come on Jake!

18:17.130 --> 18:25.002
¶ ¶ ¶

19:33.206 --> 19:36.541
Cooler full of beers.
Compliments of the house.

19:36.543 --> 19:37.208
More beer!

19:37.210 --> 19:38.743
Thanks Bobby!

19:41.181 --> 19:44.048
Great taste in brand,
old school man.

19:44.050 --> 19:46.284
Old school. Right.

19:49.055 --> 19:51.989
Block Island here we come!

20:01.568 --> 20:03.067
Hi, this is Harry Fellows,

20:03.069 --> 20:06.003
leave a message and call
me whatever you want,

20:06.005 --> 20:07.805
Hey Harry, it's Harley.

20:07.807 --> 20:10.741
We caught a ride over with
some fishermen who are...

20:10.743 --> 20:15.880
Well, I have, let's just say
I have a bad feeling about them.

20:15.882 --> 20:20.084
Listen, if you don't see us in
a couple hours send the cavalry.

20:21.788 --> 20:23.955
Who wants a Harry's High Tide?

20:23.957 --> 20:25.456
What's in it?

20:25.458 --> 20:29.994
Oh, well, that's a secret.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.095
Mmm, that right?

20:31.097 --> 20:33.397
Vodka and hot sauce.

20:33.399 --> 20:36.934
The rest is escaping
me at the moment

20:36.936 --> 20:39.403
because you're
so beautiful, cutie.

20:39.405 --> 20:43.407
Ki... kiwi. It was kiwi.

21:28.054 --> 21:31.322
Reloading. Anyone need one?

21:31.324 --> 21:33.791
I'll take another brew-dogger.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.565
Whoa. Take it easy big guy.

21:41.567 --> 21:43.567
Someone's been over-served.

21:43.569 --> 21:47.104
I could kill like thirty
beers and not even feel it.

21:50.176 --> 21:52.977
Beer.

21:52.979 --> 21:55.913
Dude. I wasn't ready for that.

21:55.915 --> 22:00.184
Not my fault. You need,
(burps) faster reflexes.

22:00.186 --> 22:02.386
Well you just wasted a beer.

22:15.034 --> 22:16.267
You okay man?

22:16.269 --> 22:19.537
Yeah, I was just
a little sea sick.

22:19.539 --> 22:23.040
Hey now that you're
done feeding the fishes,

22:23.042 --> 22:25.209
you want to try
getting me another beer.

22:25.211 --> 22:27.211
You're such a jerk Nicky.

23:13.025 --> 23:15.259
Hey there he is!

23:15.261 --> 23:18.562
Bobby baby, come smoke
this joint with us, man.

23:29.375 --> 23:31.876
Not bad. Where'd you get it?

23:31.878 --> 23:34.011
My boy in the Big Apple.

23:34.013 --> 23:37.281
We had weed in prison,
but not like this.

23:40.019 --> 23:41.485
Cool, man.

23:44.323 --> 23:47.324
Ashley, toss this
bad boy a beer.

23:47.326 --> 23:49.460
Yeah, grab him a beer, Ashley.

23:51.898 --> 23:53.164
Sure.

24:03.843 --> 24:06.177
Thank you.

24:06.179 --> 24:07.812
You're welcome.

24:07.814 --> 24:10.047
She's quite the little
biscuit isn't she Bobby?

24:10.049 --> 24:11.549
Oh come on Ashley.

24:11.550 --> 24:13.050
Show us all that tight
little body of yours.

24:15.154 --> 24:17.254
Shut up Nicky.

24:17.256 --> 24:19.790
Well come on,
Bobby wants to see it.

24:19.792 --> 24:22.526
She's got amazing boobies.

24:22.528 --> 24:24.795
Nicky!

24:24.797 --> 24:25.863
Knock it off.

24:25.865 --> 24:28.065
Well seriously man,
Bobby's nice enough

24:28.067 --> 24:31.802
to give us a ride.
Least we can do.

24:31.804 --> 24:34.338
Come on Ash, don't be a prude.

24:55.995 --> 24:57.294
Happy now?

24:57.296 --> 24:59.864
Yes, thank you.

24:59.866 --> 25:01.532
Triple A plus.

25:01.534 --> 25:02.933
What the hell, Ash?

25:02.935 --> 25:04.935
It was just a joke.

25:10.376 --> 25:15.513
Well, it's been real,
I better get back to work.

25:15.515 --> 25:16.981
Thanks for the stuff.

25:16.983 --> 25:18.349
Yeah man. Anytime.

25:18.351 --> 25:21.252
Do you have a bathroom?

25:21.254 --> 25:23.821
Yeah, but that's below deck.

25:23.823 --> 25:25.089
so it's off-limits.

25:25.091 --> 25:28.292
Please? I really have to pee.

25:28.294 --> 25:32.162
Twist my arm.
I'll take you down.

25:32.164 --> 25:33.230
Thanks!

25:33.232 --> 25:34.431
I'll come with you.

25:34.433 --> 25:35.900
Bobby can show me.

25:35.902 --> 25:37.067
You sure?

25:37.069 --> 25:38.903
She's sure.

25:38.905 --> 25:41.472
I'll be fine, Jake.

25:47.780 --> 25:50.281
How much longer you
think until we get there?

25:50.283 --> 25:52.850
In this crap-box? Who knows.

25:52.852 --> 25:55.452
(Shouts) Hey Cappy! Who
taught you how to drive a boat!

25:55.454 --> 25:56.954
Step on it, would ya!

25:56.956 --> 25:59.089
Stop provoking these guys.

25:59.091 --> 26:02.259
Not my fault
Ashley has nice boobs.

26:08.568 --> 26:10.134
Right this way.

26:10.136 --> 26:12.469
Thanks.

26:12.471 --> 26:16.874
Oh, sorry, I didn't realize
anyone else was down here.

26:17.977 --> 26:20.244
Ashley, meet Krista.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.880
Hi, nice to meet you.

26:24.984 --> 26:28.352
She doesn't say much.
Bathroom's down there.

26:28.354 --> 26:31.088
Thanks.

26:56.882 --> 26:58.582
Great.

27:03.222 --> 27:06.557
Es questo un Cubano?

27:06.559 --> 27:11.028
Si. Took it from Carson
Senior's humidor last night.

27:11.030 --> 27:12.997
Alright.

27:27.446 --> 27:28.379
You're not doing,
what are you doing,

27:28.381 --> 27:29.146
you're not doing it right.

27:29.148 --> 27:29.980
You got to twist it.

27:29.982 --> 27:30.781
I am twisting it.

27:30.783 --> 27:32.249
You're terrible at this.

27:32.251 --> 27:35.119
Don't tell me how to
light a cigar, Duker.

27:35.121 --> 27:37.321
I steal them from
my dad all the time.

27:47.199 --> 27:48.165
What's the matter Jake?

27:49.568 --> 27:51.368
Is it Bobby?

27:51.370 --> 27:53.037
You got to let that
jail-bird go man.

27:53.039 --> 27:54.905
He's fine.

27:54.907 --> 27:57.074
I'm worried about Ashley.

27:57.076 --> 27:58.175
I don't think
she's ready for this

27:58.177 --> 27:59.910
and if anything
happens at this party,

27:59.912 --> 28:01.311
like if she starts drinking.

28:01.313 --> 28:03.013
We're not her keeper Jake.

28:03.015 --> 28:06.550
Technically you two
aren't even together anymore.

28:10.189 --> 28:13.791
You ever going to tell us what
really happened between you two?

28:17.196 --> 28:18.862
The night before she
was going to rehab

28:18.864 --> 28:22.433
I was staying at her house.

28:22.435 --> 28:28.172
She was all twisted about going.

28:28.174 --> 28:30.307
I was just trying
to be supportive.

28:32.445 --> 28:35.045
I thought everything
was going fine.

28:36.415 --> 28:39.216
We watched a movie in her room.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.552
I went down to
get some ice cream,

28:41.554 --> 28:43.987
and when I came back
up she was doing lines

28:43.989 --> 28:45.355
of heroin on her desk.

28:45.357 --> 28:48.125
Everyone's doing that drug now.

28:48.127 --> 28:52.296
I freaked out and told her
to dump it in the toilet.

28:54.033 --> 28:57.835
That's when her dad came in,

28:57.837 --> 29:01.205
saw it, and started blaming me.

29:01.207 --> 29:05.242
He charged me,
threw me up against the wall.

29:10.483 --> 29:17.321
I don't know,
something in me just snapped.

29:19.191 --> 29:24.027
I don't remember how but
I got him to the ground,

29:24.029 --> 29:27.364
started throwing punches
until he went limp.

29:27.366 --> 29:33.070
Ashley was screaming these
terrible blood curdling screams.

29:33.072 --> 29:34.605
So I bolted.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.409
Intense man.

29:39.411 --> 29:43.113
The worst part is I feel
like I traumatized Ashley.

29:43.115 --> 29:46.216
It tore me up all year.

29:46.218 --> 29:50.020
All I wanted to do was
see her and I couldn't.

29:50.022 --> 29:52.389
Her parents wouldn't
let me talk to her obviously.

29:53.959 --> 29:57.094
I thought maybe on
this trip I could but...

29:57.096 --> 30:03.333
I don't know, it's been
a real game of inches, man.

30:05.805 --> 30:09.006
I feel you, Harley.

30:09.008 --> 30:12.075
That's why I never fall for
the ladies when I hook up.

30:12.077 --> 30:16.814
As soon as you get wet,
the head games begin.

30:23.856 --> 30:28.292
What? It's true.

30:28.294 --> 30:31.428
You're an idiot Carson.

30:42.508 --> 30:45.943
Oh sorry. Hope I'm
not interrupting.

30:48.247 --> 30:49.613
Not at all.

30:49.615 --> 30:52.382
Why don't you stick
around for a little while.

30:56.856 --> 30:59.890
So, do you guys
actually live in here?

31:04.029 --> 31:05.095
Want a shot?

31:05.097 --> 31:06.463
Oh. No thanks.

31:08.100 --> 31:10.467
Nothing but the
best around here.

31:15.808 --> 31:18.375
I just got out of rehab.

31:18.377 --> 31:22.246
Rehab's for quitters.

31:22.248 --> 31:24.982
Quitters and spitters.

31:28.487 --> 31:31.154
Is that...?

31:31.156 --> 31:33.557
It's just a little coke.

31:33.559 --> 31:38.195
Or I got heroin too,
if that's more your speed.

31:45.371 --> 31:47.104
I better go upstairs.

31:47.106 --> 31:51.575
Don't be like that. You're a
guest on my boat. I insist.

31:58.450 --> 32:04.855
No. I'm sober.

32:04.857 --> 32:07.124
Come on, get crazy with us.

32:07.126 --> 32:11.461
Yeah, I've seen what you
got under that dress.

32:11.463 --> 32:13.897
Let's open that up.

32:19.538 --> 32:21.405
I wanna leave.

32:25.577 --> 32:28.345
I'm not stopping you.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.247
You're standing in my way.

32:30.249 --> 32:32.382
Am I?

32:36.088 --> 32:38.221
I don't.

32:38.223 --> 32:39.423
Sure you do.

32:39.425 --> 32:41.525
Don't fight it.

32:41.527 --> 32:44.127
I can tell you and
Jake were a thing, right.

32:44.129 --> 32:46.196
Disappointed you huh.

32:46.198 --> 32:49.866
No.
Yeah.

32:49.868 --> 32:51.802
I'd never do that.

32:51.804 --> 32:53.570
Disappoint you.

32:56.442 --> 33:02.346
I may not have much,
but what I do have...

33:18.464 --> 33:24.034
She's feisty Bobby.
I like that.

33:24.036 --> 33:27.270
Me too.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.440
Easy there Big Man!
You almost got me.

33:30.442 --> 33:33.543
Screw you Skywalker!
Come to the dark side!

33:36.515 --> 33:38.849
Why are we stopping?

33:42.354 --> 33:43.553
Ash, what's wrong?

33:43.555 --> 33:47.057
He tried to... I don't know.

33:47.059 --> 33:48.291
It was...
Bobby?

33:53.165 --> 33:59.369
You stay down here, puppet.

34:29.101 --> 34:32.235
Hey Bobby, did you pull
something down there?

34:32.237 --> 34:34.204
She should be flattered.

34:34.206 --> 34:35.238
She's not.

34:35.240 --> 34:36.373
Jake.

34:36.375 --> 34:37.941
Hey, Jake come on.

34:37.943 --> 34:41.244
Look Bobby, we're not
accusing you of anything.

34:41.246 --> 34:44.481
No? That's what it sounds like.

34:44.483 --> 34:47.951
No, I'm sure there's just
been a misunderstanding.

34:47.953 --> 34:49.319
Is that what this is?

34:49.321 --> 34:52.489
Yes. How much longer until
we get to Block Island?

34:55.627 --> 34:58.195
Block Island?

34:58.197 --> 35:02.032
Hey, we have friends
waiting for us.

35:02.034 --> 35:04.167
They know we're on your boat.

35:04.169 --> 35:06.203
Is that right?

35:06.205 --> 35:08.205
Yeah, they're waiting.

35:08.207 --> 35:10.307
You people don't
like to wait, do you?

35:10.309 --> 35:15.445
No, we don't.
So take us to Block Island.

35:15.447 --> 35:22.486
Or else... what, exactly?

35:26.592 --> 35:30.293
We just want you to
take us to Block Island.

35:30.295 --> 35:32.963
Well maybe I want to
renegotiate terms.

35:36.902 --> 35:39.870
Renegotiate?

35:39.872 --> 35:44.641
Yeah, I'm thinking I'm
gonna need a another $400

35:44.643 --> 35:49.312
to get you there and
since you were so gung-ho

35:49.314 --> 35:51.214
about pimping out Ashley, Nicky,

35:53.352 --> 35:56.520
I'm thinking a threesome with
her and my girl down below

35:56.522 --> 35:58.321
should square us away.

36:00.292 --> 36:05.996
Speaking of "down below",
how's your grooming Ashley?

36:05.998 --> 36:10.267
Because I like 'em clean, shaved
and tighter than a preschooler.

36:11.603 --> 36:13.069
C'mon Carson.

36:16.575 --> 36:17.941
Kick his ass Big Man.

36:21.113 --> 36:23.180
C'mon get in there.

36:24.483 --> 36:26.516
Carson get up.

36:26.518 --> 36:29.052
C'mon Carson.

36:39.565 --> 36:42.065
Whoa, easy there Jake.

36:42.067 --> 36:45.235
Step away from that harpoon.

36:45.237 --> 36:47.571
Too late for that now.

36:49.641 --> 36:52.442
I told you never to second
guess yourself my man.

36:52.444 --> 36:54.010
Now look at ya.

36:56.982 --> 36:58.582
Everything good Bobby?

36:58.584 --> 37:00.884
Yeah under control Cap.

37:00.886 --> 37:03.486
This one just got excited.
Needed a little adjustment.

37:03.488 --> 37:04.888
He's crazy!

37:04.890 --> 37:06.256
Why don't you all just sit down

37:06.258 --> 37:10.560
and try not to fulfill
all my expectations.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.996
Get their phones.

37:12.998 --> 37:16.466
Phones. Now!

37:25.143 --> 37:28.378
I hate this vest.

37:35.354 --> 37:37.554
Why are you doing this?

37:37.556 --> 37:41.157
Because, we can.

37:41.159 --> 37:47.230
And because you were stupid
enough to ask Bobby for a ride.

37:47.232 --> 37:48.531
I mean, look at him.

37:48.533 --> 37:51.001
Does he look like the
kind of guy you can trust?

37:53.472 --> 37:55.605
Ooh, easy there Jake.

37:59.278 --> 38:02.178
Bobby, come on man.

38:02.180 --> 38:05.348
Come on, what?

38:05.350 --> 38:07.884
People saw us talking
to you in the bar.

38:07.886 --> 38:09.486
The cops are going to
come looking for you.

38:09.488 --> 38:10.987
You think anyone around here

38:10.989 --> 38:14.090
cares what happens to a
bunch of rich kids like you?

38:14.092 --> 38:17.394
New London is my town.

38:17.396 --> 38:21.231
Those people are my people,
all you do is come in here

38:21.233 --> 38:22.932
and piss all over it,
all over them.

38:22.934 --> 38:25.402
You think anyone
is going to lift a finger

38:25.404 --> 38:27.370
to make sure you kids are okay?

38:27.372 --> 38:29.005
I got news for ya.

38:29.007 --> 38:31.207
Most of them will sleep better
at night knowing you're not.

38:31.209 --> 38:32.208
Fuck you!!!

38:32.210 --> 38:36.046
Ahhhhhhhhh!

38:36.048 --> 38:39.516
Oh my God!
Carson! No!

38:39.518 --> 38:42.185
Carson.

38:42.187 --> 38:44.220
What the hell's the
matter with you?

38:44.222 --> 38:46.389
Sorry, Cap.

38:46.391 --> 38:49.025
We're just supposed
to rob them Bobby.

38:49.027 --> 38:51.394
Why is that gun even loaded?

38:51.396 --> 38:53.630
They were asking for it Stoney.

38:53.632 --> 38:57.500
Answer the question!

38:57.502 --> 39:00.937
Aren't you sick of this?

39:00.939 --> 39:06.643
I am, I'm sick of them,
all of it!

39:45.851 --> 39:49.619
So what do you want to do?

40:00.999 --> 40:02.966
Not much choice now.

40:19.017 --> 40:20.316
Oh, chill with that Krista.

40:20.318 --> 40:22.352
We don't have to break
out your Narcan again.

40:22.354 --> 40:24.053
What was that noise out there?

40:24.055 --> 40:26.623
Nothing. Tie him to a chair.

40:26.625 --> 40:28.642
What'd he do?

40:28.643 --> 40:30.660
Something someone gets tied
to a chair for, just do it.

40:30.662 --> 40:32.929
You, down.

40:57.289 --> 40:58.521
Mouth, too?

40:58.523 --> 41:00.457
Yeah. Stuff him.

41:07.265 --> 41:12.068
Are you sure? His mouth is
tweaking me something awful.

41:12.070 --> 41:14.170
Stop it! Leave him alone!

41:14.172 --> 41:16.105
She's a live one Jake.

41:16.107 --> 41:18.575
I bet she's great in the sack.

41:18.577 --> 41:21.077
Jake, Jake!

41:21.079 --> 41:23.046
Leave her alone!

41:34.526 --> 41:36.392
Better!

41:37.362 --> 41:39.496
Come here baby.

42:09.327 --> 42:14.230
Kiwi? Revs up your gut flora.

42:21.640 --> 42:24.874
So, Nicky the smart-ass.

42:24.876 --> 42:26.242
You a college boy?

42:29.581 --> 42:31.414
Your answers are
going to matter here.

42:31.416 --> 42:33.917
Yes. I go to college.

42:33.919 --> 42:38.221
I'll bet your old man had
to pull some serious strings

42:38.223 --> 42:41.925
to get a screw head
like you into a good school.

42:41.927 --> 42:44.661
Not that you'd appreciate it.

42:49.868 --> 42:52.569
College is a flawed
endeavor anyway,

42:52.571 --> 42:55.104
it's all about
the past preparing you

42:55.106 --> 42:59.475
for the future,
without being in the present.

42:59.477 --> 43:01.945
Hey man, do, do you want
money to let us go?

43:01.947 --> 43:03.179
My dad is CEO of a bank.

43:03.181 --> 43:04.280
He'll give you
whatever you want.

43:04.282 --> 43:07.116
I promise I won't say
a word about any of this.

43:07.118 --> 43:10.320
Do you really think
this is about money now?

43:12.591 --> 43:14.958
Bobby was right
about one thing.

43:25.870 --> 43:28.404
I come from a long
line of fishermen.

43:30.542 --> 43:35.612
My family had a house on Block
Island as far back as 1920.

43:36.982 --> 43:39.282
That is until the bank took it.

43:39.284 --> 43:41.050
I'm sorry man.

43:41.052 --> 43:45.188
A bank just like your daddy's.

43:45.190 --> 43:49.626
Rich pigs like him came
in and pushed my family out.

43:49.628 --> 43:52.595
No, no my family...

44:06.111 --> 44:08.411
The day they took my home,

44:08.413 --> 44:12.915
I heard one of those smug sons
of demons say to the other,

44:12.917 --> 44:15.885
"Hey, where you want
to have breakfast later?"

44:17.989 --> 44:20.123
End of my world.

44:20.125 --> 44:22.291
Life goes on, nothing personal.

44:28.533 --> 44:33.236
I've been forced to accept
that as a natural order.

44:33.238 --> 44:38.141
The rich push the poor,
think they can keep on pushing,

44:38.143 --> 44:40.510
always have in the past,
always will in the future.

44:42.514 --> 44:46.149
Nothing personal,
that's the way it is.

44:48.953 --> 44:54.223
But, just like you and
your expensive schools,

44:54.225 --> 44:56.492
they don't see the present.

44:58.396 --> 45:01.364
They don't see their
blood in the water.

45:04.302 --> 45:06.102
I do.

45:09.340 --> 45:13.543
I've watched and waited
in the now for a long time,

45:16.247 --> 45:23.152
seeing the terrain,
smelling the blood,

45:23.154 --> 45:27.557
itching for my
moment to push back.

45:27.559 --> 45:30.126
My family doesn't even
own a house on Block Island.

45:30.128 --> 45:32.061
We didn't do anything to you.

45:34.933 --> 45:37.300
You to need to adjust
your expectations

45:37.302 --> 45:39.001
and get into the now.

45:41.673 --> 45:44.474
I live there and
everything I need is

45:44.476 --> 45:46.642
right is here on this
boat because of it.

45:52.550 --> 45:55.318
Out here is my sanctuary.

45:55.320 --> 45:58.588
My peace from your storm.

46:07.165 --> 46:08.965
You know, I'm one of
the few fishermen left

46:08.967 --> 46:12.101
in this area who still
makes a living at it.

46:12.103 --> 46:14.370
Everyone else has
been starved out.

46:19.410 --> 46:21.944
I'm a dying breed.

46:25.650 --> 46:28.284
We have that in
common, you and me.

46:30.355 --> 46:36.259
You don't know it,
but your time is just about up.

46:36.261 --> 46:40.329
And when it is,
life will go on

46:40.331 --> 46:45.234
and one of us
will have breakfast.

46:45.236 --> 46:48.671
Please, I don't have
an issue with you,

46:48.673 --> 46:51.340
I know you didn't want this.

46:51.342 --> 46:54.177
That's true enough.
I did not want to be here.

46:54.179 --> 46:56.279
But here is where I am.

46:56.281 --> 46:58.014
This isn't you.

46:58.016 --> 47:00.416
It's Bobby, you know that.

47:00.418 --> 47:02.518
Bo, Bobby is the problem.

47:02.520 --> 47:04.420
Is that right,
you don't like Bobby?

47:04.422 --> 47:06.255
He's an animal!

47:06.257 --> 47:09.292
I'd be careful what I say
about him if I were you.

47:09.294 --> 47:10.626
The way I hear him tell it,

47:10.628 --> 47:12.929
he liked boys just
like you in prison.

47:12.931 --> 47:14.597
He should be shot!

47:32.050 --> 47:34.550
You see that scruff Nicky?

47:34.552 --> 47:36.352
That's called prison pussy.

47:36.354 --> 47:38.421
Please.

47:38.423 --> 47:42.525
Don't beg. Come on man
you're making me feel bad.

47:55.607 --> 48:00.576
Hell, you know what?
I'm going to help you out.

48:00.578 --> 48:04.180
Do you want to get Bobby
back for killing your friend?

48:04.182 --> 48:06.315
Hey! Hey! Hey!

48:06.317 --> 48:09.652
Get out of your head,
into the now.

48:12.523 --> 48:15.458
Do you want to get Bobby back?

48:19.330 --> 48:22.565
Now's your chance.

48:22.567 --> 48:25.334
Shut up.
You got us into this mess.

48:31.676 --> 48:34.644
What's it going to be smart-ass?

48:34.646 --> 48:38.047
The moment is yours.

48:38.049 --> 48:39.548
You gonna push?

49:16.587 --> 49:21.958
I didn't think you had
it in you, good for you.

49:21.960 --> 49:24.226
Get him up.

49:31.402 --> 49:33.402
Get up.

49:41.446 --> 49:44.981
I'm going to take you to my
favorite spot in the ocean,

49:44.983 --> 49:47.450
and since it'll be the
last thing you ever see,

49:51.622 --> 49:55.091
because you just impressed me,

49:55.093 --> 49:57.126
I'm going to let you
pilot the boat.

50:23.421 --> 50:27.556
Please. You have to help us.

50:27.558 --> 50:31.093
What is wrong with you?

50:34.665 --> 50:37.299
Let me out of here!

50:46.344 --> 50:49.612
See Nicky, Nicky, Nicky.

50:56.387 --> 50:58.454
Where to?

50:58.456 --> 51:00.689
The Race.

51:00.691 --> 51:02.958
That current's gonna
love you so much

51:02.960 --> 51:05.194
it's never going to let you go.

51:05.196 --> 51:07.530
Eyes front.

52:01.185 --> 52:02.651
I'll be right back.

52:02.653 --> 52:04.920
Take care of them now, please.

52:04.922 --> 52:06.455
Just a little fun first.

52:06.457 --> 52:08.591
No, fun is over Bobby.

53:37.248 --> 53:38.948
See land.

53:38.950 --> 53:40.449
Do you see those
lights out there?

53:45.423 --> 53:47.523
What are we going to do?

53:47.525 --> 53:48.924
We can swim for it.

53:48.926 --> 53:50.526
Looks about
a half mile away.

53:50.528 --> 53:52.161
What about Nicky?

53:52.163 --> 53:53.629
We can't just leave him
here with those guys.

53:56.567 --> 53:58.033
They've got him.

53:58.035 --> 54:00.052
We got to get off
the boat and get help.

54:00.053 --> 54:02.070
It's the only way to
save him and ourselves.

54:02.073 --> 54:05.274
We got to jump. You ready?

54:13.384 --> 54:14.550
What the hell happened?

54:14.552 --> 54:16.118
I couldn't help it Bobby,
they got away.

54:16.120 --> 54:18.420
You had one job to do!

54:20.024 --> 54:21.323
It's freezing.

54:24.562 --> 54:26.996
Start swimming it
will warm you up.

54:29.333 --> 54:31.066
They got away.

54:31.068 --> 54:32.334
What do you mean?

54:32.336 --> 54:33.168
They must have jumped off,

54:33.170 --> 54:34.570
tried to swim for it.

54:34.572 --> 54:37.072
They can't be far.

54:37.074 --> 54:38.474
Bring her around.

54:38.476 --> 54:41.076
We're going fishing.

54:49.253 --> 54:52.354
I can't either. It's too far.
Yes you can.

54:52.356 --> 54:53.989
Yes you can.

54:53.990 --> 54:55.623
You see that
lighthouse over there?

54:55.626 --> 54:58.093
That's where we're going,
just stay with me okay.

55:19.750 --> 55:22.051
Come on Ash. Keep swimming.

55:25.656 --> 55:27.256
I can't.

55:27.258 --> 55:29.124
Please, Ash they're coming.

55:32.930 --> 55:34.496
Jake, I can't swim anymore.

55:34.498 --> 55:36.131
Go on without me.

55:36.133 --> 55:37.399
No.

55:37.401 --> 55:39.301
A boat's coming, just hang on.

55:41.939 --> 55:43.505
Are we going to die, Jake?

55:43.507 --> 55:44.723
We're not going to die.

55:44.724 --> 55:45.940
Listen to me. Ashley.
Pay attention.

55:45.943 --> 55:49.144
Just look at me. I'm going
to think of something, okay.

55:54.385 --> 55:55.317
Do you trust me?

55:57.221 --> 55:58.454
I trust you.

55:58.456 --> 55:59.755
I love you.

55:59.757 --> 56:01.023
I love you too.

56:24.281 --> 56:27.049
HELP! We're over here.
Help! Help!

56:27.051 --> 56:30.152
Got 'em Stoney! Dead ahead!

56:33.457 --> 56:35.324
Yeah I see.

56:56.680 --> 57:01.450
Ah look, I caught
me a pretty one!

57:10.127 --> 57:13.328
Now that's a keeper.

57:23.007 --> 57:25.274
What do you want
to do about Jake?

57:25.276 --> 57:27.476
Up to you!

57:29.747 --> 57:32.414
Let's run him down!

57:32.416 --> 57:33.482
What? No!

57:33.484 --> 57:35.417
No, no, no you can't do this.

57:35.419 --> 57:36.985
I can do whatever I want.

57:38.456 --> 57:39.755
Jake!

57:53.704 --> 57:55.304
Hey! Come back.

58:15.059 --> 58:18.460
Go straight for him now,
you hear me? Don't stop.

58:18.462 --> 58:20.529
Don't do this to him please.

58:20.531 --> 58:22.464
He's my best friend!

58:22.466 --> 58:24.700
You steer that wheel an
inch in either direction,

58:24.702 --> 58:26.502
I blow your brains all over it.

58:26.504 --> 58:28.337
Understand?

58:28.339 --> 58:30.105
Huh!!

58:38.415 --> 58:40.516
Jake!

58:45.956 --> 58:48.223
Portside Stoney.

58:49.193 --> 58:51.326
Oh my God!

58:54.632 --> 58:59.001
That's it Jake! Swim for it!

58:59.003 --> 59:00.569
You can't do this.

59:00.571 --> 59:04.273
Nowhere to go!
Hahaha!

59:04.275 --> 59:06.441
No! You just stop the boat.

59:06.443 --> 59:09.411
Good boy. That's it.

59:10.948 --> 59:12.948
Please no.

59:12.950 --> 59:14.683
Please!

59:28.666 --> 59:31.667
Jake! Jake!

59:31.669 --> 59:33.602
You son of a bitch!!

1:00:05.502 --> 1:00:08.337
Jake!

1:00:13.110 --> 1:00:16.144
Carson! Carson!

1:00:30.361 --> 1:00:34.463
Do something about her,
will you Bobby.

1:00:34.465 --> 1:00:37.065
Nice work Stoney.

1:00:37.067 --> 1:00:38.333
You figured out a
way to shut him up.

1:00:38.335 --> 1:00:41.403
Whoa!!
Where you going sweetheart?

1:00:43.674 --> 1:00:46.341
Nicky.

1:00:46.343 --> 1:00:48.777
Nicky please!

1:01:00.391 --> 1:01:02.491
Rebutle.

1:01:03.427 --> 1:01:06.028
Watch.

1:01:06.030 --> 1:01:09.064
Now watch.
This is how it's done.

1:01:09.066 --> 1:01:11.566
Any of you guys
seen Jake Harley?

1:01:13.303 --> 1:01:16.405
I just listened to a message
from him and he said he got

1:01:16.407 --> 1:01:19.274
a ride from some
fishermen from New London.

1:01:19.276 --> 1:01:21.276
So?

1:01:21.278 --> 1:01:23.545
That was over four hours ago.

1:01:23.547 --> 1:01:25.180
He should have been here by now.

1:01:25.182 --> 1:01:27.015
Dude, he probably got trashed

1:01:27.017 --> 1:01:29.384
and ended up in a
bar in Old Harbor.

1:01:29.386 --> 1:01:31.386
He would have texted me.

1:01:31.388 --> 1:01:34.656
We have to go and
find him ourselves.

1:01:34.658 --> 1:01:36.491
A rescue mission.

1:01:36.493 --> 1:01:37.993
Who's in?

1:01:37.995 --> 1:01:40.495
I'm coming!

1:01:40.497 --> 1:01:41.563
I'm coming.

1:01:41.565 --> 1:01:43.632
No way. You're too drunk.

1:01:43.634 --> 1:01:47.436
Dude, Jake's my best friend.

1:01:47.438 --> 1:01:49.771
Okay you can come.

1:02:09.226 --> 1:02:11.059
What's that?

1:02:11.061 --> 1:02:14.963
My Dad's rifle. Just in case.

1:02:14.965 --> 1:02:17.599
For protection.

1:02:17.601 --> 1:02:19.768
Oh, we forgot snacks.

1:02:24.174 --> 1:02:28.577
Get up. We got work to do.

1:02:28.579 --> 1:02:31.379
Get up.

1:02:39.490 --> 1:02:42.257
Throw that piece
of meat overboard.

1:02:42.259 --> 1:02:44.593
He's stinking up my boat.

1:02:44.595 --> 1:02:48.363
Help her out smart-ass.

1:02:50.701 --> 1:02:53.001
Go on, pick him up.

1:03:01.211 --> 1:03:03.712
Is he dead?

1:03:03.714 --> 1:03:04.646
What are you doing out here?

1:03:04.648 --> 1:03:06.148
I told you to stay down below.

1:03:06.150 --> 1:03:09.117
You didn't say anyone
was going to die Bobby.

1:03:09.119 --> 1:03:11.486
Bobby all respect,
shut her blow hole

1:03:11.488 --> 1:03:13.421
or I'll shut it for you.

1:03:21.398 --> 1:03:24.099
He's too heavy, I can't.

1:03:27.137 --> 1:03:28.436
Looks like smart-ass can't pull

1:03:28.438 --> 1:03:30.272
his weight around here Cap.

1:03:30.274 --> 1:03:32.774
I guess he needs a
little extra motivation.

1:03:32.776 --> 1:03:34.676
No, no, we can do this.

1:03:36.713 --> 1:03:38.146
We can do this.

1:03:40.117 --> 1:03:44.419
Nicky, you have to help me okay?

1:03:44.421 --> 1:03:46.087
Please.

1:03:46.089 --> 1:03:48.390
It's Carson!

1:03:48.392 --> 1:03:50.425
They did this to him!

1:03:50.427 --> 1:03:51.993
I know. I know.

1:03:51.995 --> 1:03:55.463
But it's like we're
burying him, okay.

1:03:55.465 --> 1:03:59.701
That's it.
A burial at sea for the Big Man.

1:04:02.005 --> 1:04:03.338
Come on.

1:04:09.346 --> 1:04:11.246
Anybody have any final words

1:04:11.248 --> 1:04:13.982
for the dear,
dumb-ass dead departed?

1:04:20.524 --> 1:04:24.793
Sorry Big Man.
It was all my fault.

1:04:27.431 --> 1:04:30.065
Love you, Carson.

1:04:39.209 --> 1:04:42.377
Personally I thought
he was a pussy.

1:04:42.379 --> 1:04:44.312
Well it's not
really a party until

1:04:44.314 --> 1:04:46.514
a rich prick falls in the drink.

1:04:51.355 --> 1:04:55.724
Both of you. Down below.

1:05:00.264 --> 1:05:02.063
You too.

1:05:19.316 --> 1:05:25.120
¶ ¶ ¶

1:05:52.149 --> 1:05:57.252
Hey, how we
supposed to find them?

1:06:14.338 --> 1:06:16.771
Look at him crawling around
like a lobster, Krista.

1:07:27.677 --> 1:07:32.080
Crawl! Crawl! Crawl!

1:07:32.082 --> 1:07:35.383
Crawl lobster, crawl like a
little lobster that you are.

1:07:35.385 --> 1:07:38.119
C'mon crawl, crawl, crawl.

1:07:38.121 --> 1:07:39.687
Stop it! Leave him alone!

1:07:54.204 --> 1:07:58.673
Say, "I'm a lobster."

1:07:58.675 --> 1:08:01.709
Say, "I'm a lobster!"

1:08:01.711 --> 1:08:03.812
I'm a lobster!

1:08:03.814 --> 1:08:07.649
Not to me. To the lobster.

1:08:07.651 --> 1:08:10.285
I'm a lobster!

1:08:10.287 --> 1:08:11.419
Louder!

1:08:11.421 --> 1:08:13.388
I'm a lobster! I'm a lobster!

1:08:13.390 --> 1:08:14.255
I'm a lobster! I'm a lobster!

1:08:14.257 --> 1:08:17.425
I'm a lobster! I'm a lobster!

1:08:17.427 --> 1:08:20.095
Yeah you're a lobster.

1:08:50.594 --> 1:08:53.294
He likes you, he likes you.

1:08:53.296 --> 1:08:56.164
Look, he thinks you're cute.

1:08:57.400 --> 1:08:58.333
Give him a little kiss.
Little kiss.

1:08:58.335 --> 1:09:00.135
No please, no, no, no.

1:09:00.137 --> 1:09:02.504
You don't like the
little lobster boyfriend.

1:09:02.506 --> 1:09:04.506
You don't like it?
You don't like it?

1:09:04.508 --> 1:09:05.740
Then shut up.

1:09:05.742 --> 1:09:07.709
Shut up!

1:09:09.479 --> 1:09:13.615
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!

1:09:27.364 --> 1:09:29.330
I think it's time to
have a little party now.

1:09:29.332 --> 1:09:31.299
No Bobby, don't do it.

1:09:31.301 --> 1:09:33.201
Shut up, lobster!

1:09:46.550 --> 1:09:48.349
Fire!

1:09:53.790 --> 1:09:55.390
Over there!

1:11:05.195 --> 1:11:07.262
Please! I can't!

1:11:27.784 --> 1:11:30.051
Help me.

1:11:31.521 --> 1:11:37.292
Oh, oh, that's right,
I remember when

1:11:37.294 --> 1:11:40.295
your face lit up when
Krista mentioned heroin.

1:11:40.297 --> 1:11:42.697
That's your drug, isn't it?

1:11:43.333 --> 1:11:45.500
No, please.

1:11:45.502 --> 1:11:47.068
No stop it.

1:12:03.053 --> 1:12:05.086
This is called Steel Cake.

1:12:06.423 --> 1:12:08.189
And you're going to snort it.

1:12:09.826 --> 1:12:11.626
Bobby! She can't snort all that.

1:12:11.628 --> 1:12:12.827
Shut up!

1:12:30.613 --> 1:12:32.580
Not enough of a choice?

1:12:36.252 --> 1:12:38.152
How's this.

1:12:38.154 --> 1:12:40.254
Get off of her.

1:12:44.260 --> 1:12:49.364
Now, you can snort this,

1:12:53.303 --> 1:12:55.269
or you can suffocate.

1:13:03.480 --> 1:13:04.846
Again.

1:13:16.826 --> 1:13:23.164
Ashley! Ashley!
She's overdosing.

1:13:23.166 --> 1:13:24.365
We have to help her!

1:13:26.069 --> 1:13:27.402
No we don't.

1:13:27.404 --> 1:13:29.103
You're a bastard!

1:13:29.105 --> 1:13:31.105
Yeah. I am.

1:13:32.442 --> 1:13:35.610
Krista give me the gun.

1:13:35.612 --> 1:13:37.078
Krista!

1:13:48.792 --> 1:13:51.426
I was saving you for last.

1:13:59.202 --> 1:14:00.701
All good things...

1:14:14.517 --> 1:14:19.353
Stone? Stoney you up there?

1:14:19.355 --> 1:14:21.656
Stone's dead.

1:14:21.658 --> 1:14:26.360
Jakey? That you?

1:14:26.362 --> 1:14:28.029
Back from the dead?

1:14:30.099 --> 1:14:31.399
Get up.

1:14:40.710 --> 1:14:42.643
I got smart-ass
here, Jake!

1:14:45.248 --> 1:14:47.849
I'm gonna put a
couple holes in him!

1:14:52.222 --> 1:14:54.489
Your girl is
ODing on heroin.

1:14:56.493 --> 1:14:58.759
Back to her old ways.

1:15:03.566 --> 1:15:05.199
Stone?

1:15:18.314 --> 1:15:20.248
C'mon Ashley.

1:15:22.585 --> 1:15:26.254
Hey! Wake up!

1:15:26.256 --> 1:15:28.155
Wake up Ashley.

1:15:30.393 --> 1:15:32.093
Wake up.

1:15:32.095 --> 1:15:34.195
Ashley, wake up.

1:15:43.740 --> 1:15:49.210
Here. Give her this.

1:15:49.212 --> 1:15:50.311
What is that?

1:15:50.313 --> 1:15:52.697
It's Narcan.

1:15:52.698 --> 1:15:55.082
Spray it in her nose and it
counter-acts the opiates.

1:15:59.656 --> 1:16:04.458
Okay. Just spray. Go ahead.

1:16:08.197 --> 1:16:10.431
Okay. Now let's get
her on her side.

1:16:24.714 --> 1:16:27.815
Thank God!
Ashley, hey, you're okay.

1:16:27.817 --> 1:16:29.150
You're okay.

1:16:29.152 --> 1:16:30.451
Jake?
I'm here.

1:16:30.453 --> 1:16:32.720
I'm here.

1:16:59.415 --> 1:17:01.549
Hang tight.
I gotta get Nicky.

1:17:07.090 --> 1:17:08.823
Thank you.

1:17:15.598 --> 1:17:17.298
Nicky?

1:17:20.670 --> 1:17:22.269
Good night Jake.

1:17:42.792 --> 1:17:44.325
That guy's shooting at us!

1:17:44.327 --> 1:17:45.726
We have to call the police!

1:17:47.530 --> 1:17:50.598
Harry Fellows to
Block Island Police! Come in.

1:18:12.588 --> 1:18:14.722
I can't get a clear shot!

1:18:14.724 --> 1:18:16.357
Say goodnight Jakey.

1:18:16.359 --> 1:18:17.491
No! Don't shoot him!

1:18:21.531 --> 1:18:24.231
Is everybody coming back
from the dead tonight?

1:18:24.233 --> 1:18:27.101
Bobby please,
I will do anything!

1:18:27.103 --> 1:18:28.569
Well Jake I think I
have one more thing

1:18:28.571 --> 1:18:30.805
I want you to see
before you die.

1:18:30.807 --> 1:18:33.841
Admit it. You want this.

1:18:37.647 --> 1:18:39.714
I don't like you anymore Bobby.

1:19:04.407 --> 1:19:07.308
You know why you second
guess yourself Jake?

1:19:07.310 --> 1:19:10.811
Because you're a killer,
I can see it in your eyes.

1:19:10.813 --> 1:19:15.449
You're a killer just
like me only it scares you.

1:19:19.055 --> 1:19:21.789
But second guessing isn't
gonna change who you are.

1:19:21.791 --> 1:19:24.425
It's just going to be
the edge I need to kill you.

1:19:27.597 --> 1:19:29.730
Shoot him!

1:19:32.535 --> 1:19:37.104
What? You can't shoot me!

1:19:37.106 --> 1:19:40.508
I'm invincible!

1:19:44.514 --> 1:19:46.714
Hey Bobby!

1:20:03.533 --> 1:20:10.304
Killer. I see you killer.
I see you.

1:20:31.260 --> 1:20:35.095
We need to get every
one off this boat. Now!

1:20:37.567 --> 1:20:40.067
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.

1:21:57.813 --> 1:21:59.880
