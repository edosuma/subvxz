00:00.043 --> 00:01.914
Previously on Black Lightning...

00:01.917 --> 00:02.997
Dr. Jace.

00:03.000 --> 00:04.689
You're wanted in Markovia.

00:04.693 --> 00:07.533
The Markovians are on
the outskirts of Freeland

00:07.536 --> 00:09.897
and they're marshalling their forces.

00:09.900 --> 00:11.660
_

00:11.663 --> 00:15.759
The Markovians want to capture
or kill as many metas as possible.

00:15.762 --> 00:18.803
This occupation won't end until
I stabilize the meta-gene itself.

00:18.806 --> 00:21.032
It has to be extracted
from a human host.

00:21.035 --> 00:23.059
Only one patient
survived taking the serum.

00:23.062 --> 00:25.300
Now, you work for me,
you miserable bastard.

00:25.303 --> 00:27.578
I need you to bring
Tavon back to Freeland.

00:27.581 --> 00:28.597
Too dangerous.

00:28.600 --> 00:30.290
He needs to be with his family.

00:30.293 --> 00:31.807
Come on, Tavon.

00:31.810 --> 00:33.222
Run!

00:34.528 --> 00:35.906
What happened?

00:35.909 --> 00:36.950
We got ambushed.

00:36.953 --> 00:38.354
No, no, Tavon!

00:38.357 --> 00:40.195
- Remember his face!
- Tavon! Tavon!

00:40.197 --> 00:41.279
What the hell is going on?

00:41.282 --> 00:43.482
Stand down!

00:43.485 --> 00:45.582
ASA tanks and heavily
armored checkpoints

00:45.585 --> 00:47.632
enforce the total isolation of Freeland.

00:47.635 --> 00:50.200
Nevertheless, a resistance
has begun to arise

00:50.203 --> 00:52.203
Tavon Singley and Jefferson Pierce

00:52.206 --> 00:53.420
are the spark we need.

00:53.423 --> 00:56.430
But it's time to run the ASA out
of here, take our freedom back.

00:56.433 --> 00:58.535
They hit us with some kind of poison.

01:11.446 --> 01:14.381
I guess if you're seeing this,

01:16.431 --> 01:18.222
it means I didn't make it...

01:22.908 --> 01:24.468
and I'm okay with that.

01:24.471 --> 01:26.721
Really, I am.

01:30.595 --> 01:32.916
Because I know my sacrifice...

01:32.918 --> 01:34.227
it meant something.

01:40.241 --> 01:41.400
Jen...

01:44.972 --> 01:46.239
Jen, I'm sorry.

01:51.121 --> 01:53.361
I'm so sorry for leaving you.

01:54.982 --> 01:56.165
Especially...

01:58.652 --> 02:00.044
with what you're going through.

02:01.636 --> 02:02.826
Mom.

02:04.366 --> 02:05.591
Dad.

02:08.662 --> 02:09.762
Uncle Gambi.

02:10.639 --> 02:13.306
I knew what I was doing,

02:13.309 --> 02:15.001
and it was worth the risk.

02:19.506 --> 02:21.149
Now, none of you

02:21.151 --> 02:23.478
are gonna take comfort

02:23.481 --> 02:25.111
in hearing this,

02:26.513 --> 02:27.975
but it's because of you

02:30.976 --> 02:32.451
that I was strong enough

02:34.664 --> 02:36.289
to do what had to be done.

02:42.905 --> 02:44.130
You all taught me

02:45.699 --> 02:47.903
to stand up for what's right

02:47.906 --> 02:50.418
even if it's difficult

02:50.421 --> 02:52.795
because evil triumphs

02:54.166 --> 02:55.861
when good people do nothing,

02:57.544 --> 02:59.485
and I damn sure

02:59.488 --> 03:01.355
wasn't gonna do nothing.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.119
How are Tavon's parents?

03:21.068 --> 03:23.277
Uh, better than I would be.

03:23.279 --> 03:25.237
Is there anything that they need?

03:25.239 --> 03:26.738
Anything that we can do?

03:26.740 --> 03:29.074
Wish there was, but...

03:29.076 --> 03:30.986
No, what they need, we can't give them.

03:33.406 --> 03:34.904
I'm proud of you, Jeff.

03:36.917 --> 03:39.602
Proud? Of what?

03:41.213 --> 03:43.778
For not suiting up to
avenge Tavon's death.

03:46.069 --> 03:47.592
I know this must be hard for you,

03:47.594 --> 03:49.469
but it was the right thing to do.

03:49.471 --> 03:51.096
How can you say that to me,

03:51.098 --> 03:52.388
here of all places?

03:52.391 --> 03:53.908
Innocent people are dying, Lynn.

03:53.911 --> 03:55.035
- Kids are dying.
- Shh...

03:55.038 --> 03:56.768
- No. Tavon is dead.
- Jeff.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.602
Do you hear me?

03:58.605 --> 04:00.294
Tavon is dead.

04:01.817 --> 04:03.626
This is not just about us anymore.

04:22.629 --> 04:23.646
Mr. Pierce.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.299
Mr. Pierce, I'm sorry to do this.

04:27.301 --> 04:29.255
Jamillah, now isn't a good time.

04:29.258 --> 04:31.678
But the people deserve
to know the truth.

04:31.680 --> 04:32.971
Mr. Pierce, how are you feeling

04:32.973 --> 04:34.473
after your altercation with the ASA?

04:34.475 --> 04:35.908
Do you plan on pressing charges?

04:37.073 --> 04:39.055
Mr. Pierce, do you
think that your actions

04:39.058 --> 04:40.355
will inspire the residents of Freeland

04:40.357 --> 04:42.114
to push back against the occupation?

04:42.116 --> 04:44.483
Excuse me, young lady,
I don't know who you are,

04:44.485 --> 04:46.485
but show some respect. This
is not the time or place.

04:46.487 --> 04:48.153
Mr. Pierce, one last question.

04:48.155 --> 04:50.659
If you could say anything
to Tavon Singley right now,

04:50.662 --> 04:51.826
what would that be?

04:53.494 --> 04:55.504
Can you please let us grieve in peace?

04:56.806 --> 04:58.539
Anissa, it's okay.

05:03.170 --> 05:04.437
I'll answer that question.

05:07.150 --> 05:10.758
If I could say anything
to Tavon, I'd tell him

05:10.761 --> 05:12.445
how proud I am of him.

05:13.898 --> 05:15.472
I'd tell him how much

05:15.474 --> 05:17.241
he inspired the other students

05:19.324 --> 05:20.494
and me...

05:21.855 --> 05:24.457
to be the best version of ourselves.

05:25.835 --> 05:27.195
I would tell him that his death...

05:31.749 --> 05:33.632
His death will not be in vain.

05:59.678 --> 06:01.112
You look tired, Jeff...

06:01.115 --> 06:02.161
Long night?

06:02.163 --> 06:03.505
Okay, so you heard...

06:03.508 --> 06:06.398
That Black Lightning nearly
killed two ASA commandos

06:06.400 --> 06:09.067
and Zorro'd a lightning bolt
onto the side of a building?

06:09.069 --> 06:10.878
Yeah, Jeff, I heard.

06:10.881 --> 06:12.008
The whole damn town heard.

06:12.011 --> 06:14.072
I was going to talk to you about
it before I went out, but...

06:14.074 --> 06:15.383
But you didn't.

06:15.385 --> 06:17.576
Instead, you reacted
the way you always do,

06:17.578 --> 06:19.067
and now we have to pay the price.

06:20.205 --> 06:22.205
Look, Odell is not going
to do anything to us

06:22.207 --> 06:24.374
or the girls. We are
too valuable to him.

06:24.376 --> 06:25.851
How can you be so certain?

06:30.190 --> 06:31.240
I thought so.

06:33.218 --> 06:34.843
You're unbelievable.

06:34.845 --> 06:36.979
What do you expect me to do, Lynn? Huh?

06:36.981 --> 06:38.597
Just sit around and do nothing?

06:38.599 --> 06:39.982
I can't, not anymore.

06:39.984 --> 06:42.201
I expect you to keep your word.

06:42.203 --> 06:44.078
I expect you to treat me like a partner

06:44.080 --> 06:47.239
and not make decisions that affect
all of us without talking to me.

06:47.241 --> 06:49.733
I expect you to not put
our family in jeopardy.

06:49.735 --> 06:52.110
I expect you to not go
out as Black Lightning

06:52.112 --> 06:54.255
every time you want to ease
your troubled conscience.

06:54.257 --> 06:56.656
No, no, no, this is not
about me, this is about...

06:56.658 --> 06:58.083
Who? Who, Jeff?

06:58.085 --> 06:59.927
Earl? Alvin?

06:59.929 --> 07:01.053
Tavon?

07:01.055 --> 07:02.954
You keep telling yourself that.

07:02.956 --> 07:05.123
Because no matter how
heroic you think you are,

07:05.125 --> 07:06.925
I know the truth.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.168
This is not about Freeland.

07:08.170 --> 07:10.128
It's not about Tavon, it's about you.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.554
It's always about you.

07:17.447 --> 07:19.763
If you'll excuse me,
I have lives to save.

07:20.787 --> 07:23.662
Hopefully, Odell won't throw
me in a cell when I get there.

07:32.036 --> 07:34.378
So, how're you doing?

07:37.323 --> 07:40.041
I thought that's what you're
supposed to be telling me.

07:40.044 --> 07:42.452
Oh, I'm waiting on test results.

07:42.454 --> 07:44.246
I was talking about Tavon.

07:44.248 --> 07:46.081
His death must be weighing on you.

07:46.083 --> 07:47.666
Do you want to talk about it?

07:47.668 --> 07:49.185
No amount of talking

07:51.103 --> 07:52.813
is going to bring Tavon back.

07:54.466 --> 07:56.508
So what's the point?

07:56.510 --> 07:59.803
The point is that you can't
carry something like this around.

07:59.805 --> 08:01.897
It'll eat at you. Trust me.

08:15.880 --> 08:17.171
It's that good, huh?

08:25.514 --> 08:27.238
This poison is...

08:27.241 --> 08:30.851
breaking down your cells faster
than anything I have ever seen.

08:30.853 --> 08:33.352
If you hadn't had your
meta-human healing ability...

08:34.347 --> 08:35.866
you'd probably be dead already.

08:43.698 --> 08:46.890
Had my healing ability?

08:46.893 --> 08:49.466
Whatever is in you is
suppressing your meta-gene.

08:51.040 --> 08:53.666
Right now you're as vulnerable as I am.

08:53.668 --> 08:55.426
You're getting weaker by the second.

08:56.546 --> 08:58.879
So, what's next? What we are gonna do?

08:58.881 --> 09:02.073
I've come in contact with a
variation of this poison before.

09:02.075 --> 09:05.719
But this one, this one
is ten times as potent.

09:05.721 --> 09:07.555
So I'm trying to
supercharge the antivenom

09:07.557 --> 09:10.908
that I've already created
but... that takes time.

09:12.169 --> 09:14.103
Look, how much time I got?

09:14.105 --> 09:15.837
At the rate this toxin is spreading...

09:17.090 --> 09:19.632
a week. Maybe two.

09:22.300 --> 09:24.377
Anissa, you've got to tell
parents what's going on.

09:24.380 --> 09:26.115
No, I don't, and neither do you.

09:28.386 --> 09:30.380
You can't ask me to keep this from them.

09:32.606 --> 09:34.039
Uncle Gambi, listen to me.

09:35.275 --> 09:38.109
I'll tell them if and
when the time comes,

09:38.111 --> 09:41.496
but until then, I need you
to keep this between us.

09:41.498 --> 09:44.115
They're going through enough as it is.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.284
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.619
Then give me a day.

09:47.621 --> 09:49.454
If you can't stop what's happening to me

09:49.456 --> 09:50.889
in these next 24 hours,

09:52.334 --> 09:53.892
I'll tell Mom and Dad then.

09:55.166 --> 09:56.228
Please.

09:59.456 --> 10:00.724
Okay.

10:03.136 --> 10:05.804
Twenty-four hours. But that's it.

10:05.806 --> 10:06.962
I'll take it.

10:13.146 --> 10:14.622
You should get home.

10:14.624 --> 10:16.389
Get some rest.

10:16.392 --> 10:18.292
I'll call you as soon
as I have something.

10:19.486 --> 10:21.233
Promise.

10:21.236 --> 10:22.463
Thank you.

10:31.048 --> 10:32.664
Hey.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.499
This fake news ASA is putting out,

10:34.501 --> 10:35.781
it's making us look bad.

10:37.305 --> 10:39.804
It's like the resistance is
causing more harm than good.

10:39.807 --> 10:41.840
What about Truthteller Johnson?

10:41.842 --> 10:43.817
I thought he was spreading
our gospel to Freeland.

10:43.819 --> 10:45.196
- Yeah.
- He was.

10:45.199 --> 10:47.536
Until Freeland PD fished him
out of the river this morning.

10:47.539 --> 10:49.398
Oh, my God.

10:49.400 --> 10:52.226
So, maybe you should lead
with that then, brother.

10:52.229 --> 10:53.945
I mean, are you sure it's him?

10:53.948 --> 10:55.106
It's him all right.

10:55.109 --> 10:57.187
Shouldn't we be running or something?

10:57.190 --> 10:58.907
I mean, if they got Truthteller, then...

10:58.909 --> 11:01.693
If he said something, do you think
I'd be standing here right now?

11:01.695 --> 11:03.695
I'd be the first person
they threw under the jail.

11:03.697 --> 11:04.863
So what's the play?

11:06.032 --> 11:07.341
What are we supposed to do now?

11:07.343 --> 11:09.009
Well, like I said,

11:09.011 --> 11:10.869
we need to get our
truth to all of Freeland,

11:10.871 --> 11:12.305
not just the five-mile radius

11:12.308 --> 11:15.540
that Truthteller was reaching
with that bootleg setup he had.

11:15.542 --> 11:17.339
Gina, you said you had a nephew who

11:17.342 --> 11:19.186
is an engineering student at Bowman.

11:19.188 --> 11:20.545
Yeah, why?

11:20.547 --> 11:22.046
I want you to get him

11:22.048 --> 11:24.424
and as many of those
tech nerds as it takes

11:24.426 --> 11:25.925
to build a radio system

11:25.927 --> 11:28.052
strong enough to broadcast
to all of Freeland.

11:28.054 --> 11:29.988
What if something goes wrong?

11:29.990 --> 11:31.729
What if I get caught?

11:31.732 --> 11:33.158
I strongly suggest you don't.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.894
With no Truthteller,

11:35.896 --> 11:38.385
who's going to be the
voice of the resistance?

11:38.388 --> 11:39.790
Leave that to me.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.409
Dr. Stewart.

11:51.411 --> 11:54.244
I was beginning to think
you didn't love me anymore.

11:54.247 --> 11:57.652
What, no witty comeback?

11:57.655 --> 12:00.552
Did someone wake up on the wrong
side of the light socket this morning?

12:00.554 --> 12:02.697
I'm not here to talk to you, Tobias.

12:02.700 --> 12:04.589
I'm just here to check
your healing properly,

12:04.591 --> 12:06.591
so I can harvest
another round of marrow.

12:06.593 --> 12:08.902
So you can cure the pod kids.

12:08.904 --> 12:10.571
I didn't say anything
about the pod kids.

12:10.573 --> 12:12.224
You didn't have to.

12:12.227 --> 12:13.765
Helping them would be the only reason

12:13.767 --> 12:15.924
Odell pulled me out
of the hole I was in.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.371
You know you can't trust him, right?

12:20.607 --> 12:21.790
So, whatever he promised...

12:21.792 --> 12:23.274
But I suppose I can trust you?

12:23.276 --> 12:25.221
I'm a true friend, Dr. Stewart.

12:25.224 --> 12:27.005
I'd much rather stab you in the front,

12:28.073 --> 12:29.948
whereas Odell...

12:29.950 --> 12:32.075
Well, you get the metaphor.

12:32.077 --> 12:33.618
We're not friends, Tobias.

12:35.247 --> 12:38.599
You're a lab rat that I can
use and discard as I please.

12:39.935 --> 12:42.770
You want to be my friend, Dr. Stewart,

12:42.772 --> 12:44.563
because friends keep
their friends' secrets.

12:44.565 --> 12:47.674
I'm tired of your empty threats.

12:47.676 --> 12:50.778
You're on lockdown with no
access to the outside world.

12:50.780 --> 12:53.218
You're never going to see
the light of day again.

12:57.787 --> 12:59.511
I hear your man went all theatrical.

12:59.513 --> 13:02.372
Burning lightning bolts on the
side of buildings and whatnot.

13:03.751 --> 13:04.833
Such a goon.

13:07.958 --> 13:10.288
- How do you know about that?
- I have my ways.

13:10.290 --> 13:13.157
I always have my ways.

13:13.159 --> 13:15.219
So, like I said, Dr. Stewart...

13:16.353 --> 13:18.310
You wanna be my friend?

13:18.313 --> 13:19.765
What do you want?

13:22.165 --> 13:24.645
I want a list of every meta
in this place, complete with

13:24.647 --> 13:26.170
their particular set of powers.

13:26.172 --> 13:27.505
I can't do that.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.507
Oh...

13:29.509 --> 13:30.818
I think you can.

13:32.329 --> 13:35.121
And... I think you will.

13:41.572 --> 13:44.188
Anissa, your father is at the door.

13:45.835 --> 13:46.983
Shonda...

13:46.985 --> 13:48.001
Yes, Anissa?

13:49.154 --> 13:50.170
Pause music.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.733
And open front door.

14:44.584 --> 14:47.474
I'm never gonna get used
to these smart houses.

14:48.555 --> 14:49.855
What're you doing here, Dad?

14:50.900 --> 14:53.400
I... just came to check on you.

14:53.402 --> 14:55.760
You were beat up pretty bad.

14:55.762 --> 14:57.063
Look who's talking.

14:59.775 --> 15:03.013
Yeah. I just wanted to make
sure that you were okay.

15:03.970 --> 15:05.370
As you can see, I'm fine.

15:07.273 --> 15:09.374
So, if that's all you wanted...

15:10.419 --> 15:12.669
you came all this way for nothing.

15:12.671 --> 15:14.046
I also...

15:15.999 --> 15:17.390
wanted to say I'm sorry.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.512
I pressured you to bring
Tavon back to Freeland.

15:27.269 --> 15:29.289
I was wrong.

15:29.292 --> 15:30.812
You were right.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.465
Tavon's death is on me.

15:36.445 --> 15:39.163
And I'm gonna have to live with
that for the rest of my life.

15:41.529 --> 15:45.082
I knew it was a bad idea,

15:45.085 --> 15:48.110
and I did it anyway.

15:50.975 --> 15:52.292
So Tavon's death,

15:54.377 --> 15:55.545
that's on me.

15:56.897 --> 15:58.090
Not you...

15:59.492 --> 16:00.759
not the ASA...

16:03.334 --> 16:04.554
me.

16:07.459 --> 16:09.163
And that is something

16:09.166 --> 16:10.477
that I...

16:12.606 --> 16:13.955
have to live with...

16:16.009 --> 16:17.734
for the rest of my life.

16:17.736 --> 16:19.722
- No, Anissa...
- You should go.

16:20.847 --> 16:22.861
Shonda,

16:22.864 --> 16:24.680
open front door.

16:30.857 --> 16:32.040
So, it's like that.

16:34.077 --> 16:35.210
It's like that.

16:36.884 --> 16:38.130
Okay.

16:42.085 --> 16:43.343
Okay.

16:58.027 --> 17:00.360
Anissa, Anissa.

17:01.387 --> 17:02.904
Thank God, I was so scared.

17:04.811 --> 17:06.185
What happened?

17:06.188 --> 17:09.441
I don't know. I walked in and
found you unconscious on the floor.

17:11.894 --> 17:14.480
I don't know. I must have
gotten lightheaded or something.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.287
Anissa, if we're really
trying to do this,

17:19.289 --> 17:20.905
if we're really trying
to make this work,

17:20.906 --> 17:22.715
you have to trust me
enough to let me in.

17:22.718 --> 17:25.742
I'm not a porcelain doll, I'm not
going to break if you lean on me.

17:25.744 --> 17:27.929
Hey, hey, babe, I know that.

17:28.915 --> 17:31.571
And when I need to lean on you, I will.

17:31.574 --> 17:33.149
I'm just...

17:33.152 --> 17:36.749
I'm just still recovering from
my run-in with Bruce Leroy.

17:37.812 --> 17:39.098
That's all.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.571
When I morph into the leopard,

17:44.573 --> 17:47.056
I don't remember a lot, but the smells,

17:47.058 --> 17:48.891
they always stay with me.

17:48.893 --> 17:53.080
The smell of... fresh cut grass,

17:53.083 --> 17:55.374
the smell of the air
right before the rain...

17:57.461 --> 17:58.585
the smell of death.

17:59.946 --> 18:02.089
Death? Wait, mmm-mmm.

18:03.950 --> 18:05.467
Nobody's dying here.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.845
Yeah, okay. I'm a little beat up.

18:12.071 --> 18:13.333
Okay.

18:15.086 --> 18:18.171
I'm a little more than a little beat up,

18:18.173 --> 18:19.746
but I'm good.

18:19.749 --> 18:21.295
I want to believe you.

18:21.298 --> 18:23.634
Then you should believe me.

18:23.636 --> 18:26.137
Look, if it makes you feel any better,

18:26.139 --> 18:28.639
I went to see Uncle Gambi.

18:28.641 --> 18:32.143
And he's working on
something to fix me up.

18:32.145 --> 18:33.978
Said I'll be back on my feet in no time.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.196
You promise?

18:35.198 --> 18:38.691
Girl, we've been through
too much to be together.

18:38.694 --> 18:40.946
I'm not about to lose you now.

18:42.547 --> 18:43.713
If you say so.

18:45.708 --> 18:46.991
I do.

18:51.122 --> 18:52.722
I like the sound of that.

18:56.502 --> 18:59.604
Well, since you're okay...

19:00.840 --> 19:02.383
I'm gonna go take a shower.

19:09.140 --> 19:12.433
If you get lonely, you
know where to find me.

19:12.436 --> 19:13.985
I damn sure do.

20:07.773 --> 20:09.674
What is this?

20:27.974 --> 20:29.407
Who the hell is this kid?

20:39.605 --> 20:41.235
All right, Brandon.

20:41.238 --> 20:42.767
Let's see what you're hiding.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.380
Mom.

20:55.398 --> 20:56.998
What're you doing in my apartment?

20:57.001 --> 20:59.248
Don't dash, you perv. Why
do you have photos of my mom?

20:59.250 --> 21:00.301
It's not even like that.

21:01.873 --> 21:03.073
Would you just let me explain?

21:17.702 --> 21:19.058
What the hell was that?

21:37.546 --> 21:39.162
Agent Odell.

21:39.165 --> 21:40.998
I can't say I'm surprised to see you.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.310
Mr. Pierce, I came by to tell you that

21:43.312 --> 21:46.743
the ASA has a team of neurologists

21:46.746 --> 21:48.672
standing at the ready

21:48.674 --> 21:51.726
to give you a thorough examination.

21:51.728 --> 21:55.322
I don't need a neurologist, I'm fine.

21:55.324 --> 21:58.516
I beg to differ.

21:58.518 --> 22:00.735
You must have suffered brain damage

22:00.737 --> 22:02.311
to think there'd be no consequences

22:02.313 --> 22:03.455
from breaking our deal.

22:04.315 --> 22:08.001
Ah... our deal

22:08.003 --> 22:10.194
made me a guinea pig

22:10.196 --> 22:12.696
and took me away from my
family for over a month.

22:12.698 --> 22:15.917
Our deal got me beat down
in front of my own school,

22:15.919 --> 22:17.177
in front of my own daughter.

22:17.179 --> 22:21.299
Our deal kept me from saving Tavon.

22:21.302 --> 22:23.141
Our deal is over.

22:23.143 --> 22:24.875
Our deal

22:24.877 --> 22:26.353
protected your family

22:26.355 --> 22:28.480
from taking your place in the Pit.

22:30.883 --> 22:33.243
If you even think

22:33.246 --> 22:36.279
about laying a finger on my girls,

22:37.890 --> 22:41.201
I will barbeque your black ass.

22:47.066 --> 22:48.736
Mr. Pierce,

22:50.640 --> 22:54.368
you don't want to make
an enemy out of me.

22:55.366 --> 22:57.245
That's funny, Agent Odell.

22:59.054 --> 23:01.895
I was about to tell you the same thing.

23:16.012 --> 23:17.466
'Sup? Y'all got room for one more?

23:27.335 --> 23:28.676
Where did he go?

23:28.679 --> 23:29.990
Where the hell did he go?

23:48.836 --> 23:50.121
You could've said no.

24:10.216 --> 24:11.416
Halt!

24:35.841 --> 24:37.276
Let him through.

24:39.637 --> 24:42.796
Now we go to work.

24:56.173 --> 24:57.538
Come in.

25:00.467 --> 25:01.490
Hmm.

25:02.535 --> 25:04.416
Thank you. I can take it from here.

25:05.538 --> 25:06.763
Jamillah Olsen.

25:07.924 --> 25:09.125
Please, take a seat.

25:12.854 --> 25:13.978
Chief Henderson.

25:15.674 --> 25:17.725
I have to admit, I'm...

25:17.728 --> 25:19.844
surprised you finally agreed to see me.

25:19.847 --> 25:21.295
This isn't an interview.

25:23.156 --> 25:24.614
This is an interrogation.

25:26.109 --> 25:27.725
Excuse me?

25:27.727 --> 25:29.367
I can draw a direct correlation

25:29.370 --> 25:32.205
from some of those "girl on
the street" interviews of yours

25:32.207 --> 25:34.231
and the escalating insurgent violence

25:34.233 --> 25:35.733
in the streets of Freeland.

25:35.735 --> 25:37.210
That's ridiculous.

25:37.212 --> 25:40.204
Uh, unfortunately for you, it isn't.

25:40.206 --> 25:42.072
I've lived in Freeland my entire life,

25:42.074 --> 25:44.742
but you, you just came
here looking for a story.

25:44.744 --> 25:46.422
Try to make a name for yourself.

25:48.056 --> 25:50.914
Hell, I should have arrested you on GP

25:50.916 --> 25:53.978
for ambushing Jefferson
Pierce at Tavon Singley's wake.

25:55.730 --> 25:57.713
Now you stop what you're doing.

25:57.715 --> 25:58.881
Right now.

25:58.883 --> 26:00.600
Or the next interview you do

26:00.602 --> 26:02.860
will be from the wrong
side of iron bars.

26:02.862 --> 26:03.927
I can't.

26:03.929 --> 26:04.929
What you mean, you can't?

26:06.149 --> 26:07.740
What's happening here is wrong

26:07.742 --> 26:09.058
and the people need to know.

26:09.060 --> 26:11.077
If I have to go to jail
to make that happen,

26:11.079 --> 26:12.282
then I will.

26:18.778 --> 26:20.138
That's what I hoped you would say.

26:22.090 --> 26:24.462
What? Okay, I'm so confused.

26:24.465 --> 26:26.040
Let's just say

26:26.043 --> 26:29.237
I have a job opening for
your particular set of skills.

26:29.240 --> 26:30.930
Working with you?

26:30.932 --> 26:32.765
That's a hard pass.

26:32.767 --> 26:34.853
You want to be the voice of the people?

26:34.856 --> 26:36.752
The voice of a movement?

26:36.754 --> 26:38.048
Here's your chance.

28:00.713 --> 28:02.393
All right, I think I'm calm now.

28:04.049 --> 28:05.857
Why're you cyber-stalking my mom?

28:06.980 --> 28:08.700
I'm not stalking your mother.

28:09.531 --> 28:12.055
I'm looking for Dr. Jace.

28:12.057 --> 28:13.866
Your mom is the last link I have on her.

28:13.868 --> 28:15.968
Wait, why're you
looking for that psycho?

28:19.040 --> 28:21.031
Jace killed my mother.

28:21.033 --> 28:22.408
I came to Freeland to make sure

28:22.410 --> 28:25.185
that I put Dr. Jace in a
grave right alongside her.

28:25.188 --> 28:27.288
But you need to keep my
family out of your business.

28:27.290 --> 28:28.411
Done.

28:30.743 --> 28:32.836
I'm sorry for breaking into your spot.

28:32.839 --> 28:35.054
I'm not.

28:35.056 --> 28:38.041
I'm actually glad to have
someone to talk to about all this.

28:39.635 --> 28:41.752
Question, what's with all the coal?

28:41.754 --> 28:43.754
You have a mad grilling
habit or something?

28:46.476 --> 28:48.425
I think it's easier if I just show you.

28:48.428 --> 28:49.444
Hold on.

28:50.690 --> 28:51.833
All right.

28:54.391 --> 28:56.241
So...

28:56.244 --> 28:57.935
my powers,

28:57.937 --> 29:01.017
they give me the ability
to manipulate the earth.

29:01.020 --> 29:02.248
Watch this.

29:06.779 --> 29:08.379
And everything that comes from it.

29:11.307 --> 29:12.381
It's a diamond.

29:12.384 --> 29:13.498
It is.

29:13.501 --> 29:15.728
And I just paid for
your college education.

29:15.731 --> 29:17.955
Put that in your treasure chest.

29:17.957 --> 29:19.056
This is tight.

29:19.959 --> 29:22.459
That's tight.

29:22.461 --> 29:25.188
I've come in contact with a
variation of this poison before.

29:25.190 --> 29:27.815
But this one, this one
is ten times as potent.

29:29.569 --> 29:30.610
It can't be.

29:43.291 --> 29:46.375
Dr. Stewart, back so soon?

29:50.990 --> 29:52.398
What is this?

29:52.401 --> 29:55.450
I temporarily disabled the
recording devices in this room.

29:55.452 --> 29:57.661
I'll give you five minutes to
memorize everything on those sheets

29:57.663 --> 29:58.944
before I destroy them.

30:01.333 --> 30:04.167
Doctor, I always knew
you'd do the right thing,

30:04.169 --> 30:05.836
and they say black women are difficult.

30:05.838 --> 30:07.504
I think, much like most Negroes,

30:07.506 --> 30:09.590
they just need the proper motivation.

30:09.593 --> 30:11.790
You're a monster, do you know that?

30:12.654 --> 30:15.137
You may think I'm a monster,

30:15.140 --> 30:16.865
but I'm nothing compared to Odell.

30:18.017 --> 30:19.774
You have no clue who he is, do you?

30:22.296 --> 30:24.187
You're just trying
to get inside my head.

30:24.189 --> 30:25.998
Maybe.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.483
If only you had a way
to make me tell the truth

30:28.485 --> 30:30.276
and get the answers you seek.

30:31.363 --> 30:33.297
Oh, wait. You do.

30:34.199 --> 30:35.675
I mean, you did.

30:37.044 --> 30:38.177
Poor, poor Issa.

30:40.706 --> 30:42.414
What do you know about Issa?

30:42.416 --> 30:45.542
The question isn't what
do I know about Issa,

30:45.544 --> 30:47.979
the question is, what does Odell know?

30:52.176 --> 30:53.192
Five minutes.

30:57.031 --> 30:59.657
Have you been reading
Michelle Obama's book lately?

31:01.518 --> 31:03.286
You sure are becoming very assertive.

31:04.307 --> 31:05.728
Hmm.

31:06.795 --> 31:10.093
Don't forget to say
hello to Jefferson for me.

31:10.096 --> 31:11.855
You haven't told him about us.

31:14.151 --> 31:17.016
- Have you?
- There is no "us," Tobias.

31:17.019 --> 31:18.351
Hmm.

31:19.912 --> 31:22.355
I wonder if the neon Negro
will see it the same way.

31:33.299 --> 31:35.267
Anissa?

31:37.930 --> 31:39.030
Anissa?

31:39.931 --> 31:41.814
Anissa, baby. Anissa.

31:41.817 --> 31:43.561
My God.

31:51.263 --> 31:52.740
Anissa, stay with me.

32:05.135 --> 32:06.581
How long has she been like this?

32:06.583 --> 32:08.504
I don't know, 15, maybe 20 minutes.

32:08.507 --> 32:09.714
She was sweating so bad,

32:09.717 --> 32:11.504
I took off her jacket and found...

32:11.507 --> 32:13.968
What is happening to her?

32:13.971 --> 32:15.063
Is she dying?

32:15.066 --> 32:16.757
Grace, I can't answer those questions.

32:16.760 --> 32:18.444
But I need you to back off a little.

32:18.446 --> 32:19.487
Please.

32:20.792 --> 32:23.349
Anissa, I'm here.

32:23.352 --> 32:24.992
You hold on.

32:29.231 --> 32:30.480
Is this gonna work?

32:30.482 --> 32:31.669
We'll have to wait and see.

32:32.818 --> 32:34.585
- It has to work.
- Come on, Anissa.

32:34.587 --> 32:35.745
Come on.

32:35.748 --> 32:37.821
It has to work. It has
to work. It has to work.

32:37.823 --> 32:40.824
Come on, Anissa, you got this.

32:40.826 --> 32:43.326
She's responding. It's working! Come on!

32:47.902 --> 32:49.141
Hey!

32:52.336 --> 32:54.003
Hey, welcome back.

32:54.006 --> 32:56.056
- Hey.
- Uncle Gambi.

32:56.058 --> 32:57.965
Don't, don't try to talk, dear.

32:58.469 --> 33:00.319
Let me help you. There we go.

33:00.321 --> 33:02.637
You just rest.

33:02.640 --> 33:05.472
And let this pretty lady
take care of you. Okay?

33:06.660 --> 33:07.859
Wait. You're leaving?

33:07.862 --> 33:09.519
There's just something
I have to take care of.

33:09.521 --> 33:11.021
What if she has a relapse or something?

33:11.023 --> 33:12.355
She should be fine.

33:12.357 --> 33:15.075
But if anything happens, I'm not far.

33:15.077 --> 33:16.755
- You got this, Grace.
- Yeah.

33:21.250 --> 33:22.437
Hey.

33:36.222 --> 33:37.880
Agent Odell, sir, sorry to interrupt,

33:37.883 --> 33:40.423
but I thought you'd want to
have this information ASAP.

33:41.512 --> 33:43.887
We detected a neutrino
anomaly in Freeland.

33:43.889 --> 33:46.273
The same anomaly that appeared
when Dr. Jace was abducted

33:46.275 --> 33:47.724
at the Freeland Police Department.

33:47.726 --> 33:50.060
So, the teleporter. Are we tracking?

33:50.062 --> 33:52.395
As of two minutes ago, the
anomaly has already shown up

33:52.397 --> 33:53.831
at the perimeter outside the armory

33:53.833 --> 33:55.541
and the detainment facility.

33:55.543 --> 33:57.877
Which leaves only three
high-level targets left.

33:57.879 --> 33:59.378
Command center,

33:59.380 --> 34:00.713
perimeter generator, and the Pit.

34:00.715 --> 34:03.782
And since the Pit is a black site...

34:03.784 --> 34:06.653
We should concentrate on the
generator and the command center.

34:06.656 --> 34:08.822
Sir, I agree.

34:08.826 --> 34:10.956
I've already put the protocols in place.

34:10.958 --> 34:13.132
Good.

34:13.135 --> 34:16.062
Let's see who's looking
through our refrigerator.

35:07.681 --> 35:09.139
So?

35:09.141 --> 35:10.525
You get what you need?

35:10.528 --> 35:11.534
No.

35:25.258 --> 35:26.592
Colonel Mosin!

35:31.172 --> 35:32.419
It's been too long.

35:33.215 --> 35:35.141
Don't strain yourself, son.

35:35.143 --> 35:37.417
I had neutrino disruptors

35:37.419 --> 35:41.388
placed around all of
our critical assets.

35:41.390 --> 35:44.174
After your great escape with Dr. Jace,

35:44.176 --> 35:46.843
you're trapped... in here,

35:46.845 --> 35:47.978
with us.

35:49.157 --> 35:50.322
We'll see about that.

35:53.911 --> 35:56.686
Gambi, you hearin' this?

35:56.688 --> 35:59.231
Sounds like a war is
breaking out at Club 100.

36:16.766 --> 36:20.810
Now... we'll finish...

36:20.813 --> 36:22.646
what we started in Moscow.

36:24.584 --> 36:26.603
Neutrino disruptors disabled.

36:32.510 --> 36:33.657
Catch you later.

36:37.396 --> 36:39.872
You should've taken out Colonel Mosin.

36:39.874 --> 36:41.357
I don't kill people.

36:45.713 --> 36:47.396
Pathetic.

36:59.520 --> 37:01.346
...glad that you're doing this.

37:01.349 --> 37:02.561
Me, too.

37:05.424 --> 37:07.441
Gina, Reverend Holt, Kyrie,

37:08.760 --> 37:11.094
let me introduce you to Jamillah Olsen,

37:11.096 --> 37:13.544
the new voice of a new Freeland.

37:13.547 --> 37:15.199
Good to see you again, Ms. Olsen.

37:15.943 --> 37:17.058
Glad to have you with us.

37:17.060 --> 37:18.502
I'm happy to be here, Reverend.

37:18.504 --> 37:20.937
Once Jamal plugs this in,
you have about two minutes

37:20.939 --> 37:22.581
to say all you need to say.

37:22.583 --> 37:23.973
No pressure.

37:25.086 --> 37:26.776
Remember, once you do this,

37:26.778 --> 37:28.113
there's no turning back.

37:31.500 --> 37:32.777
Let's make herstory.

37:32.780 --> 37:34.051
Good.

37:46.468 --> 37:48.630
Wake up, Freeland.

37:48.633 --> 37:50.756
The insurgents are not your enemy.

37:51.636 --> 37:53.520
They're fighting to protect us,

37:53.522 --> 37:54.641
all of us,

37:54.644 --> 37:57.448
against the tyranny of
our so-called protectors...

37:57.451 --> 37:58.566
the ASA.

38:05.960 --> 38:08.127
Are you such a coward

38:08.129 --> 38:10.963
that you could not wait one more second

38:10.965 --> 38:12.756
before you run away?

38:13.825 --> 38:16.826
We could have finished them both.

38:16.828 --> 38:18.873
First, I don't run.

38:18.876 --> 38:20.806
I make people run.

38:20.808 --> 38:22.199
Second,

38:22.201 --> 38:24.197
you hired me to get you
in and out of Freeland,

38:24.200 --> 38:26.080
not fight Black Lightning.

38:26.083 --> 38:28.256
Now, I held up my end of the bargain,

38:31.343 --> 38:33.190
I suggest you do the same.

38:49.337 --> 38:52.204
Nice doing business with you.

38:52.206 --> 38:55.252
It looks like you both had
a typical visit to Freeland.

39:00.038 --> 39:03.590
I thought you should know that the
metas at the detainment facility

39:03.592 --> 39:05.684
are showing no sign of illness.

39:05.686 --> 39:07.279
Which means Dr. Stewart has either

39:07.282 --> 39:10.159
discovered a way to stabilize the metas,

39:10.162 --> 39:12.090
or she's only days away.

39:12.092 --> 39:16.177
And once she does, we will
acquire that information

39:16.179 --> 39:20.282
and use it to stabilize
our own army of metas.

40:38.094 --> 40:39.903
Lynn, what're you doing?

40:41.190 --> 40:44.093
What does it look like
I'm doing? I'm leaving.

40:44.096 --> 40:47.560
Because I didn't tell you I was
going out as Black Lightning?

40:47.562 --> 40:49.029
You say it like it's nothing.

40:49.031 --> 40:50.566
That just proves my point.

40:50.569 --> 40:53.815
You claim you value me, and
yet, you don't consider me.

40:53.818 --> 40:55.318
Did you consider me

40:55.320 --> 40:56.986
before taking the job with the ASA?

40:56.988 --> 40:58.457
I had to!

40:58.460 --> 41:00.323
I'm the only one that
can help those kids.

41:00.325 --> 41:02.158
Without me, they'd all die.

41:02.160 --> 41:04.044
Welcome to my life.

41:05.356 --> 41:08.882
Look, Lynn, what I see is you
spending more time at the Pit

41:08.884 --> 41:10.579
than with your own family.

41:10.582 --> 41:12.769
Why is that? Hmm?

41:14.172 --> 41:16.172
Is there something you want to tell me?

41:17.726 --> 41:20.634
- Talk to me.
- Why talk, Jeff?

41:20.637 --> 41:22.229
I talk, you don't listen,

41:22.231 --> 41:24.639
history repeats itself.

41:24.641 --> 41:26.099
The very definition of crazy

41:26.101 --> 41:27.976
is doing the same thing
over and over again

41:27.978 --> 41:29.661
and expecting a different result.

41:29.663 --> 41:32.021
Well, I'm not crazy, I'm done.

41:32.023 --> 41:34.023
Come on, you don't...
you don't mean that.

41:34.025 --> 41:36.282
I'll send someone over to
get the rest of my stuff.

41:38.389 --> 41:40.244
Lynn.

41:40.247 --> 41:41.673
Come on. Lynn!
