that he wasn’t a good analyst.

what got him killed.

He was always finding threats
the other analysts missed.

21:28.413 --> 21:31.621

that he wasn’t good?
- Because Greg would push,

21:31.708 --> 21:34.324

were followed,
or he’d file a report.

No, but he was
working late.

21:55.273 --> 21:59.391
Mr. Rutledge did say
whatever I need.

22:00.695 --> 22:03.778
- He did say that.
- Yeah.

22:07.952 --> 22:09.943
Greg was told to testify
against someone,

22:10.038 --> 22:12.654
and he wasn’t sure whether
the guy was really guilty.

22:12.749 --> 22:14.910
But it was part of his job, and
he wanted to be a team player.

22:15.001 --> 22:18.243
- Who did he testify against?
- His name was Pedro Marquez.

22:18.338 --> 22:20.795
The agency thought
he was a terrorist.

22:20.882 --> 22:23.419
He was detained in a federal
prison for almost a year before
he was cleared of all charges.

22:23.510 --> 22:27.674
So it was Greg’s testimony
that put him behind bars.

to steal cars anymore.

23:15.019 --> 23:17.886
- Right. So, where were
you last Friday night?
- Working.

23:17.981 --> 23:20.472
Like I said,
I onlyjust got the check.

23:20.567 --> 23:23.479
At your chop shop,
do you have
a 70-gauge drill bit?

23:23.570 --> 23:25.902
- Yeah. I got every size.
- We have evidence...

23:25.989 --> 23:28.947
that, uh, Dorit here was
tortured before he was killed.

23:29.033 --> 23:31.945
- Wait. The dude’s dead?
- Yeah, and they
drilled holes into his arm.

23:32.078 --> 23:35.616
A 70-gauge bit
would be a perfect fit.
Come on.

23:35.707 --> 23:37.743
That was before the C.|.A.
gave you the check.

23:37.834 --> 23:40.450
- I’m thinking he’s looking
to take some revenge.
- Hell, no.

23:40.545 --> 23:43.036
You could ask my mother.
I would never kill no one.

23:43.131 --> 23:46.715
So I’m saying
that you followed Dorit.
You saw him take out the courier.

23:46.801 --> 23:49.918
So you probably figured
that the briefcase
was very valuable.

23:50.013 --> 23:53.221
So you killed Dorit
and you take off with the case.

23:53.308 --> 23:57.677
Is there any way possible
you guys could accuse me of
all this in a public courtroom?

23:57.770 --> 24:00.307
’Cause I’d really like
to buy my mom a new condo.

24:01.899 --> 24:05.517
[ Wendell]
According to his file, Dorit
fractured his ankle twice...

24:05.612 --> 24:08.399
trying to complete an
entry—level obstacle course
during C.|.A. training.

24:08.489 --> 24:10.866
This makes
no logical sense.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.532
He dressed like
a fictional British spy...

24:13.620 --> 24:16.111
and pursued a shadow career
as a CIA. field agent...

24:16.205 --> 24:20.619
even though he clearly did not
possess the physical aptitude
necessary for success.

24:20.710 --> 24:22.792
He didn’t wanna be stuck
behind a desk.

24:22.879 --> 24:25.495
He saw an opportunity
to live out his dreams,
and he took it.

24:25.590 --> 24:27.251
[Laughs]
That’s ridiculous.

24:27.342 --> 24:29.708
I don’t know. It’s always been
my dream to work with you.

24:29.802 --> 24:32.714
Sometimes dreaming
is the way to go.

Not in this case, of course.

of the holes drilled
in the radius.

24:39.937 --> 24:43.304
Most drill bits
leave striations.
These have none.

So... not a drill.

Excellent work,
Mr. Bray.

I’ll be sorry
to see you go.

24:55.578 --> 24:58.411
- Um, where am I going?
- Well, Cam didn’t tell you?

24:58.498 --> 25:00.284
I guess not.

25:01.501 --> 25:04.083
She can occasionally be
quite sentimental.

25:04.170 --> 25:06.912
Uh, there were funding cutbacks,
and you’ve lost your scholarship,

25:07.006 --> 25:10.498
which, of course, means
your internship is canceled.

25:13.096 --> 25:15.212
But aren’t there any other
funding resources?

25:15.306 --> 25:18.764
We have explored
all of the alternatives.

25:20.937 --> 25:24.850
Well, then I’ll take
the year off and work.

25:24.941 --> 25:28.354
But if I’m, uh, replaced here,

25:28.444 --> 25:30.355
there’s no guarantee
I can come back, right?

No. I’m sorry.

Dorit’s watch, right?

And I see that
the battery case is loose.

25:52.468 --> 25:55.881
So I open it,
and what do I find?
A bug.

25:55.972 --> 25:58.588
Why such excitement
over this particular insect?

25:58.683 --> 26:01.390
’Cause this bug
is not an insect.

It’s a bug bug.

Let’s get to Mandy.

She’s waiting
in the interrogation room.
She can continue to wait.

26:50.443 --> 26:52.559
Didn’t your book for imbeciles
teach you how to avoid injury?

26:52.653 --> 26:54.063
No. The bookstore
ran out of copies.

26:54.155 --> 26:56.111
And it’s book for dummies,
not book for imbeciles.

that I could remember
how to fix the pipes.

26:58.284 --> 27:00.900
But obviously I can’t.
I’m sure
it’s very difficult.

I mean, I can’t imagine
being capable enough
to fix my own plumbing.

Because you don’t want to.
You’d rather buy a plumber.

have someone teach me.

[Brennan ]
Rut/edge said the bug
was checked out in your name.

27:17.970 --> 27:21.462
I got the bug
because I was afraid
Greg was cheating on me.

27:21.599 --> 27:24.932
So, why didn’t you
mention this before?
We weren’t supposed to date.

27:25.061 --> 27:28.519

We’re not allowed to sleep
with someone we’re working with.

- No.

Oh, it’s okay. I’m C.|.A.

were under the radar.

But a week
before he went missing,

a little too jealous.

Wait a second.
This is how
he broke up with you?

He sent a picture
of him waving good-bye
to you in an e-mail?

Well, we had our problems.
But we loved each other.

28:00.054 --> 28:02.010
Greg was about
to propose to me.

28:02.098 --> 28:04.464
And why did you
think that?

28:04.559 --> 28:07.767
Because the last
conversation I overheard,
it was Greg and Mr. Rutledge.

about diamonds.

there’s some sort
of compression error or—

She was the only person
he could trust.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.942
He was sending her a message.

29:12.919 --> 29:14.830
Still no cause of death,

29:14.921 --> 29:19.085
but the damage to the cartilage
and lumbar vertebrae
definitely indicate torture.

29:19.175 --> 29:21.837
He was bent
in some very painful way
for a long period of time.

to get the exact position.

I found no contraction
band necrosis...

29:28.684 --> 29:30.891
in the myocardium
in the heart.

29:30.978 --> 29:33.560
That means he showed
no signs of distress
even after hours of torture.

Isn’t that impossible?
Unless the C.|.A.
underestimated this guy.

29:37.860 --> 29:39.566

that kind of abuse...

definitive than an overheard

he didn’t listen to me.

34:14.220 --> 34:17.212
Or maybe he got killed
because there was something more
dangerous in that briefcase...

34:17.306 --> 34:20.139
instead of diamonds.

34:27.233 --> 34:30.396
[ Beeping ]

34:30.486 --> 34:32.477
Hey, have you seen
Booth and Brennan?

34:32.571 --> 34:35.108
Uh, they’re in the bone room.
Is everything okay?

34:35.199 --> 34:37.406
No. The C.|.A.’s taking
over the investigation.

34:37.493 --> 34:39.449
They’re coming to collect
both sets of remains
in 10 minutes.

34:39.536 --> 34:42.824
- Wai-Wait. So we only have—
- Ten minutes, yeah.
How are things coming in here?

34:42.915 --> 34:46.078
Um, I’m-I’m still trying
to decode the image.

34:46.168 --> 34:48.910
It appears
that most of the data
is centered in his hand.

34:49.004 --> 34:50.995
And it could be
a map of some kind

34:51.090 --> 34:53.331
Well, do it fast.

34:55.552 --> 34:58.009
Rutledge is claiming
national security.
[Brennan ] He can’t do that.

34:58.097 --> 35:00.429
No, he can. He can just
bury the evidence, and we
won’t be able to touch him.

35:00.557 --> 35:02.548
[ Saroyan ] Nine minutes left.
Nine minutes?
You’re joking, right?

35:02.643 --> 35:05.760
No, it’s not a joke.
Let’s just pretend this is the
Stanley Cup finals right now.

35:05.854 --> 35:08.561
Right? You’re
down by two goals.
You got nine minutes left.

35:08.691 --> 35:11.228
Yeah, but there’s
so much data here—
The puck is about to drop.

35:11.318 --> 35:13.274
How do you wanna go down?
How do you wanna
be remembered?

35:13.362 --> 35:15.523
[Laughs]
All right.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.856
I found avulsion fractures
along the proximal humerus.

35:18.951 --> 35:21.363
Also, the heads
of each femur were
dislocated from the acetabu/a.

35:21.453 --> 35:25.116
Mr. Dorit’s body was bent back
so far that the tendons
snapped the bone.

35:25.207 --> 35:27.448
That would happen
if his hands and feet
were tied behind his back.

35:27.543 --> 35:30.751
Right. He was then
hung by his hands.
I did a computer simulation.

35:33.007 --> 35:35.749
[ Saroyan ]
Okay, ifhe was
left upside down long enough,

35:35.843 --> 35:38.209
congestion of the head and brain
would lead to asphyxiation.

35:38.345 --> 35:41.337
Petechial hemorrhaging
explains the bloodshot eyes.
We have cause of death.

35:41.432 --> 35:43.764
Great. That’s one goal,
but we still can’t tie
Rutledge to the murder.

35:43.851 --> 35:46.433
Well, when l was
in Chechnya identifying bodies,

35:46.520 --> 35:50.479
there was one victim who
suffered a Ukrainian torture
called “the swallow.”

35:50.607 --> 35:54.099
- He was suspended upside down,
very similar to this.
- [Booth] That’s not enough.

35:54.194 --> 35:56.105
Okay, look,
you got one shot.

35:56.196 --> 35:58.903
One shot on goal.
It’s an empty net.
What are you gonna do?

35:58.991 --> 36:02.779
The holes in the radius—
I’ve been trying to figure out
what caused them.

36:02.870 --> 36:04.906
it wasn’t a drill
it was something
strong enough...

36:04.997 --> 36:07.158
to bore through bone
but leave no trace.

36:07.249 --> 36:10.787
- A laser.
- Diamonds are cut by lasers.

36:10.878 --> 36:12.789
But Lena Brodsky
is the head of a diamond firm.

36:12.880 --> 36:14.791
She would have
easy access to a laser.

36:14.882 --> 36:17.749
She’s Ukrainian.
Dorit got to the case
before she did.

36:17.843 --> 36:19.754
She’s the one
who tortured
and killed Dorit.

36:19.845 --> 36:23.133
- Take the body.
- No. Wait.
You can’t take him.

36:23.223 --> 36:25.259
We’re still in regulation.
We got four minutes
left on the clock.

36:25.351 --> 36:27.512
Look, we know
you didn’t kill him.

36:27.603 --> 36:30.936
But Dorit knew Antonov
was working for Lena Brodsky.

36:31.023 --> 36:33.685
He came to you guys.
You didn’t listen, so
he takes care of it h/mse/f

36:33.776 --> 36:37.610
And then Lena ﬁnds out,
kills him. She must know
where the briefcase is.

36:42.201 --> 36:46.365
We have the neodymium laser
you used to burn holes
in Greg Dorit’s arms.

36:46.455 --> 36:49.993
And the gun you ﬁred
at Dorit’s car after you
saw him take off with your case.

36:50.084 --> 36:55.829
What was in that case
that is so much more valuable
than millions in diamonds?

36:55.923 --> 36:57.584
Where’s the briefcase, Lena?

36:59.426 --> 37:03.169
Okay, great. You know what?
Whoever hired you,
they can’t be too happy.

37:03.263 --> 37:05.720
So when we send you
back to the Ukraine,

37:05.808 --> 37:08.595
I’m sure you’ll
live a long life.

37:08.685 --> 37:10.971
I don’t know
where the case is.

37:11.063 --> 37:13.019
Dorit never talked.

37:13.107 --> 37:16.850
After what I put him through,
he should have talked.
Anyone would have talked.

37:18.695 --> 37:21.778
I’ve never seen
a man so brave.

- Booth.

It’s a map.

37:26.954 --> 37:30.663
Keep your eye on his hand.
He wasn’t waving good-bye.

37:30.749 --> 37:34.162
He was telling Mandy
where he hid his briefcase.

37:40.509 --> 37:42.670
We don’t know
what’s in that case.
You call in your cavalry.

37:42.803 --> 37:46.796
