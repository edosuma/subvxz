WEBVTT

00:01.632 --> 00:03.003
PREVIOUSLY ON "REVENGE"...

00:03.003 --> 00:04.305
WHAT ON EARTH HAVE YOU DONE?

00:04.305 --> 00:06.006
I WAS CONTACTED
AT THE OFFICE BY A WOMAN

00:06.006 --> 00:07.508
WHO TOLD ME THEY WERE
HOLDING MY FATHER

00:07.508 --> 00:08.679
AND THAT HE'D BE SAFE

00:08.679 --> 00:10.641
AS LONG AS I DID
WHAT THEY TOLD ME TO.

00:10.641 --> 00:12.183
(Amanda) YOU'RE SELLING
YOUR SHARE

00:12.183 --> 00:14.215
OF THE STOWAWAY BACK TO JACK.

00:14.215 --> 00:16.347
IT'LL WORK
BECAUSE HE TRUSTS ME.

00:16.347 --> 00:18.219
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

00:18.219 --> 00:19.720
THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT.
THE FACT THAT I HAVE IT IS.

00:19.720 --> 00:22.353
SO IT HAS BEEN YOU
ALL THIS TIME.

00:22.353 --> 00:23.724
NOW YOU'RE WALKING AWAY?

00:23.724 --> 00:25.226
THE OTHER SIDE POSSESSED
LEVERAGE WHICH, SHALL WE SAY,

00:25.226 --> 00:27.158
RENDERED THE FIGHT
TOO COSTLY.

00:27.158 --> 00:28.759
HEY. LET'S SAY SOMEBODY
WAS ABLE TO REMOVE

00:28.759 --> 00:30.631
THIS LEVERAGE
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.302
WE NEVER HAD
THIS CONVERSATION.

00:32.302 --> 00:35.536
WITH THIS RING, YOU'LL BE
IN MY LIFE FOREVER.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.568
SMILE, MR. AND MRS. PORTER.

00:37.568 --> 00:39.070
(camera shutter clicks)

00:39.070 --> 00:41.242
(radio static crackles)
 (Declan) Jack?

00:41.242 --> 00:42.643
HEY, JACK.
COME IN. IT'S DEC.

00:42.643 --> 00:45.045
(snip, static crackles)

01:02.693 --> 01:05.266
(Emily) SACRIFICE...

01:05.266 --> 01:09.100
BY ITS STRICTEST DEFINITION...

01:09.100 --> 01:11.202
TAKES SOMETHING PRECIOUS

01:11.202 --> 01:16.076
IN EXCHANGE FOR THE APPEASEMENT
 OF A HIGHER POWER...

01:20.611 --> 01:22.853
AN ABIDING DEVOTION TO A CAUSE

01:22.853 --> 01:26.857
THAT CANNOT BE SATISFIED
 WITH A SIMPLE PROMISE.

01:43.534 --> 01:45.236
BECAUSE AN OATH...

01:46.507 --> 01:49.510
NO MATTER HOW SOLEMN...

01:49.510 --> 01:52.713
ASKS NOTHING IN RETURN.

01:52.713 --> 01:55.646
WHILE TRUE SACRIFICE...

01:57.788 --> 02:00.721
DEMANDS UNSPEAKABLE LOSS.

02:05.296 --> 02:08.258
MM.

02:10.261 --> 02:11.832
WELL, MRS. PORTER,

02:11.832 --> 02:15.566
IT HAS BEEN A PERFECT DAY.

02:15.566 --> 02:17.338
AND NIGHT.

02:17.338 --> 02:19.210
(yawns)

02:19.210 --> 02:21.372
(chuckles)

02:21.372 --> 02:22.343
(chuckles)

02:22.343 --> 02:23.614
MARRIED EIGHT HOURS,

02:23.614 --> 02:25.145
AND ALREADY YOU'RE TIRED
OF KISSING YOUR WIFE?

02:25.145 --> 02:28.219
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
NOT AT ALL. NO. NEVER.

02:28.219 --> 02:29.750
I'M JUST EXHAUSTED...

02:29.750 --> 02:31.282
AND HOT.

02:31.282 --> 02:33.184
MM.

02:33.184 --> 02:34.525
MM.

02:34.525 --> 02:36.757
IT'S COOLER
UNDER THE STARS.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.189
MM.

02:38.189 --> 02:40.631
SHOULD WE TAKE IT
BACK UPSTAIRS?

02:40.631 --> 02:42.333
LET'S GO.

02:42.333 --> 02:45.366
(necklace jangling)

03:00.911 --> 03:03.354
(Conrad) WELL,
CONGRATULATIONS, VICTORIA.

03:03.354 --> 03:05.886
WITH ONE BULLET,
YOU'VE SLAUGHTERED US ALL.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.218
THE BITCH HAD IT COMING.

03:07.218 --> 03:08.389
WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO WITH HER?

03:08.389 --> 03:09.520
I--

03:09.520 --> 03:11.292
(cell phone chimes)
 OH.

03:11.292 --> 03:12.563
OH, GREAT.

03:14.925 --> 03:16.697
IT'S HER CHAUFFEUR.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.600
APPARENTLY, HE'S GROWING
IMPATIENT IN OUR DRIVEWAY.

03:19.600 --> 03:20.931
TURN THAT OFF.
THEY CAN TRACK IT.

03:20.931 --> 03:22.903
NOT YET.
 (sighs)

03:22.903 --> 03:25.276
UNROLL THE CARPET.

03:25.276 --> 03:27.278
WHAT ON GOD'S EARTH FOR?

03:27.278 --> 03:30.241
I HAVE A PLAN.
GIVE ME HER PHONE.

03:32.313 --> 03:34.545
(cell phone chimes)

03:34.545 --> 03:35.546
(beep)

03:45.756 --> 03:47.858
(starts engine)

04:03.274 --> 04:04.415
(inhales deeply)

04:04.415 --> 04:07.748
OH, THIS UNSEASONAL HEAT
IS ABSURD.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.281
I TAKE IT THAT YOU DISPOSED
OF YOUR CLOTHES LAST NIGHT?

04:10.281 --> 04:12.323
PERMANENTLY.

04:12.323 --> 04:13.324
GOOD.

04:13.324 --> 04:15.255
THE STAFF WILL BE HERE
ANY MINUTE.

04:15.255 --> 04:18.028
YOU'VE ORDERED
THE STAFF BACK?

04:18.028 --> 04:19.430
OF COURSE.

04:19.430 --> 04:21.462
ONE NIGHT WITHOUT THE HELP
IS SUSPECT ENOUGH.

04:21.462 --> 04:24.365
BESIDES, WE HAVE
A LABOR DAY PARTY TO PREPARE.

04:24.365 --> 04:26.537
THIS REALLY IS BUSINESS AS USUAL
FOR YOU TWO, ISN'T IT?

04:26.537 --> 04:28.268
PRECISELY THE POINT.
 (sets cup on saucer)

04:28.268 --> 04:30.801
CANCELING AT THE LAST MINUTE
WOULD DRAW UNWANTED ATTENTION.

04:30.801 --> 04:32.343
AND I'M INSTATING
A MORATORIUM

04:32.343 --> 04:34.305
ON THIS "YOU TWO" BUSINESS,
DANIEL.

04:34.305 --> 04:35.976
IT'S TIME
YOU STOPPED BLAMING US

04:35.976 --> 04:37.478
AND STARTED SHOULDERING
SOME RESPONSIBILITY.

04:37.478 --> 04:38.979
WHAT, LIKE YOU SHOULDERED
THE RESPONSIBILITY

04:38.979 --> 04:41.011
FOR BRINGING DOWN THAT PLANE
20 YEARS AGO?

04:41.011 --> 04:43.654
OH, WAIT. YOU LET DAVID CLARKE
DO THAT FOR YOU.

04:43.654 --> 04:45.316
SO TELL ME,

04:45.316 --> 04:46.887
WHO'S GONNA BE SHOULDERING
THE RESPONSIBILITY

04:46.887 --> 04:49.790
FOR THE MURDER
OF HELEN CROWLEY?

04:49.790 --> 04:51.462
OH, AS FATE WOULD HAVE IT,

04:51.462 --> 04:52.993
A CERTAIN
TREACHEROUS YOUNG BRIDE

04:52.993 --> 04:56.296
HAS MADE THAT A VERY SIMPLE
CHOICE FOR ALL OF US.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.469
AMANDA CLARKE?

04:58.469 --> 04:59.800
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

04:59.800 --> 05:02.373
SHE IS CHARLOTTE'S SISTER,
FOR GOD SAKE.

05:02.373 --> 05:04.775
WHAT SHE IS
IS A VICIOUS OPPORTUNIST

05:04.775 --> 05:06.477
WHO HAS UNLEASHED HOLY HELL
ON THIS FAMILY

05:06.477 --> 05:08.308
FOR A YEAR AND A HALF.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.810
SHE COULD GIVE A DAMN
ABOUT CHARLOTTE.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.012
ONLY HER TWISTED VENDETTA
AGAINST US.

05:12.012 --> 05:14.385
YEAH, A VENDETTA
THAT'S COMPLETELY JUSTIFIED.

05:14.385 --> 05:15.716
PERHAPS.

05:15.716 --> 05:17.548
BUT SHE'S NO INNOCENT.

05:17.548 --> 05:19.750
NOW AMANDA HAS THREATENED US
WITH EVIDENCE

05:19.750 --> 05:21.752
THAT WOULD SEND US
TO OUR GRAVES.

05:21.752 --> 05:23.394
SO IF DISPATCHING HER
TO THE INITIATIVE

05:23.394 --> 05:24.955
IS THE ONLY WAY
TO WIN THIS WAR,

05:24.955 --> 05:26.427
SO BE IT.
 (door closes)

05:26.427 --> 05:27.928
NOW BEFORE SHE DIED,

05:27.928 --> 05:31.101
HELEN SHOWED ME A VIDEO FEED
OF YOUR OFFICE.

05:31.101 --> 05:34.605
(sets down cup)
 AND WE'RE GOING TO USE IT
TO OUR ADVANTAGE.

05:34.605 --> 05:37.538
I'LL MEET YOU IN MY CAR
IN HALF AN HOUR.

05:38.709 --> 05:40.040
DANIEL...

05:40.040 --> 05:43.574
IN MY OFFICE, IF YOU WOULD,
MS. DAVENPORT.

05:43.574 --> 05:46.647
ENLIGHTEN ME, CONRAD.

05:46.647 --> 05:49.119
WHAT REQUIRED MY PRESENCE
IN THIS GODFORSAKEN HOUSE

05:49.119 --> 05:51.021
AT THIS GODFORSAKEN HOUR?

05:51.021 --> 05:53.384
WELL, I'VE DECIDED TO CHANGE
THE DATE

05:53.384 --> 05:56.056
OF MY GUBERNATORIAL ANNOUNCEMENT
TO, UH...

05:56.056 --> 05:57.688
THIS EVENING.

05:57.688 --> 05:59.690
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

05:59.690 --> 06:02.062
I ASSURE YOU,
I AM NOT IN A JOKING MOOD.

06:02.062 --> 06:05.466
THIS IS ABOUT AMANDA CLARKE,
ISN'T IT?

06:05.466 --> 06:07.938
I KNOW SHE BLACKMAILED YOU
INTO GIVING UP THE STOWAWAY.

06:07.938 --> 06:10.641
I WAS STANDING RIGHT OUTSIDE
THE DOOR WHEN SHE DID IT.
 OH.

06:10.641 --> 06:11.942
WHAT DOES SHE HAVE ON YOU?

06:11.942 --> 06:13.073
WELL, INSTEAD OF CONCERNING
YOURSELF WITH THE WHAT,

06:13.073 --> 06:15.005
I SUGGEST YOU FOCUS
ON THE WHO.

06:15.005 --> 06:17.107
MS. CLARKE HAS
IN HER POSSESSION THE ABILITY

06:17.107 --> 06:19.109
TO DISMANTLE
MY ENTIRE CAMPAIGN.

06:19.109 --> 06:21.652
ALL THE MORE REASON
TO POSTPONE THE ANNOUNCEMENT.

06:21.652 --> 06:23.814
OH, I'M AFRAID
THAT'S NOT AN OPTION.

06:23.814 --> 06:26.156
THEREFORE I STRONGLY RECOMMEND

06:26.156 --> 06:28.859
THAT YOU USE EVERYTHING
IN YOUR SIZEABLE BAG OF TRICKS

06:28.859 --> 06:30.861
TO PREVENT
ANY FURTHER INTERFERENCE

06:30.861 --> 06:32.523
FROM AMANDA CLARKE.

06:34.625 --> 06:36.667
(Nolan) Welcome to
my ultra-private,

06:36.667 --> 06:39.800
completely untraceable
mobile conference room.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.532
OR LOCAL TAVERN,
IN YOUR CASE.

06:41.532 --> 06:43.073
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
AT THE STOWAWAY?

06:43.073 --> 06:45.105
WELL, I TOLD
OUR FAVORITE LOVEBIRDS

06:45.105 --> 06:48.479
THAT I'D WATCH THE BAR
WHILE THEY'RE AWAY... NESTING.

06:48.479 --> 06:51.411
WHAT'S YOUR 20, MR. BEAN?

06:51.411 --> 06:52.543
That's confidential.

06:52.543 --> 06:54.084
You know the rules.

06:54.084 --> 06:56.116
1,000 FEET FROM THE BEACH HOUSE
AT ALL TIMES.

06:56.116 --> 06:58.418
Have to keep out of the way
 of prying Grayson eyes.

06:58.418 --> 07:01.191
WELL, DANIEL'S EYES AREN'T
PRYING SO MUCH AS DRIFTING

07:01.191 --> 07:02.893
AS OF LATE.

07:02.893 --> 07:04.525
LOOK, FORGIVE ME.

07:04.525 --> 07:05.626
BUT WASN'T THE WHOLE PURPOSE
OF SNUGGLING BACK UP WITH DANIEL

07:05.626 --> 07:06.797
TO GET IN WITH THE INITIATIVE?

07:06.797 --> 07:08.499
YES, ONE OF THEM, BUT--

07:08.499 --> 07:11.001
Well, then there's another
 angle we've yet to explore.

07:11.001 --> 07:12.132
Padma.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.164
UH, NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.

07:14.164 --> 07:16.537
I AM NOT PUTTING HER
IN ANY MORE DANGER

07:16.537 --> 07:18.038
than she's already in.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.610
AND I DON'T TRUST HER.

07:19.610 --> 07:22.012
SEE? OFF-LIMITS,

07:22.012 --> 07:23.974
WHY? LOOK, IT'S TOO LATE
TO SAVE HER FROM THE INITIATIVE.

07:23.974 --> 07:25.546
SHE'S ALREADY IN THEIR GRASP.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.147
BUT IF THE STORY ABOUT HER
FATHER'S KIDNAPPING IS TRUE,

07:27.147 --> 07:30.020
THEN WE MIGHT ACTUALLY
BE ABLE TO SAVE HIM...

07:30.020 --> 07:31.221
AND HER.

07:31.221 --> 07:33.183
HE IS RIGHT, NOLAN.

07:33.183 --> 07:35.886
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO HELP
PADMA AND HER FATHER,

07:35.886 --> 07:38.228
NO ONE'S BETTER EQUIPPED
TO DO THAT THAN AIDEN.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.091
(knock on door)

07:41.091 --> 07:43.063
I GOTTA GO.

07:44.995 --> 07:46.837
ASHLEY.

07:46.837 --> 07:48.168
WHAT A SURPRISE.

07:48.168 --> 07:50.501
I KNOW.
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

07:50.501 --> 07:52.503
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

07:52.503 --> 07:54.174
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

07:54.174 --> 07:57.578
SHARING CONCERN
ABOUT A MUTUAL FRIEND.

07:57.578 --> 08:00.210
I THINK AMANDA CLARKE
MIGHT BE IN OVER HER HEAD

08:00.210 --> 08:01.612
WITH THE GRAYSONS.

08:01.612 --> 08:04.014
SHE RUINED AN IMPORTANT DEAL
I'D BEEN BROKERING

08:04.014 --> 08:07.017
FOR THE SALE OF THE STOWAWAY
BY BLACKMAILING CONRAD.

08:07.017 --> 08:10.721
AMANDA, BLACKMAIL?
I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE.

08:10.721 --> 08:13.223
AND I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU
IF I HADN'T SEEN IT FOR MYSELF.

08:13.223 --> 08:15.926
SHE STORMED OVER UNANNOUNCED

08:15.926 --> 08:17.628
AND SHOWED CONRAD
SOMETHING ON HER LAPTOP

08:17.628 --> 08:19.499
THAT CAUSED HIM TO PULL
A COMPLETE 180

08:19.499 --> 08:22.102
AGAINST HIS OWN INTERESTS.

08:22.102 --> 08:25.135
WHAT WAS ON THE COMPUTER?

08:25.135 --> 08:26.807
HE DIDN'T SAY.

08:26.807 --> 08:29.039
BUT IF AMANDA'S PLANNING
A WAR AGAINST THE GRAYSONS,

08:29.039 --> 08:31.211
THEN SHE'S MAKING
A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.043
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A THREAT.

08:33.043 --> 08:34.214
IT'S THE TRUTH.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.586
THOSE PEOPLE ARE CAPABLE
OF MORE

08:35.586 --> 08:37.116
THAN YOU AND AMANDA
COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE.

08:37.116 --> 08:39.219
I'LL TALK TO HER.

08:39.219 --> 08:40.951
GOOD.

08:40.951 --> 08:41.991
EMILY...

08:41.991 --> 08:43.854
THANKS FOR
THE HEADS-UP, ASHLEY.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.164
(door closes)

09:00.641 --> 09:03.614
DAMN IT, AMANDA.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

09:07.277 --> 09:08.979
(Amanda)
GOOD MORNING, HUSBAND.

09:08.979 --> 09:12.883
(moans)

09:12.883 --> 09:16.026
WE OVERSLEPT.

09:16.026 --> 09:19.289
I MISS
OUR LITTLE ALARM CLOCK.

09:19.289 --> 09:21.161
YOU WANT TO RADIO HOME
AND CHECK ON CARL

09:21.161 --> 09:22.663
WHILE I GET US UNDERWAY?

09:22.663 --> 09:24.765
YEP.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.767
THEN I'M GONNA COOK YOU
A BIG, GREASY BREAKFAST,

09:26.767 --> 09:28.639
CAPTAIN PORTER.

09:28.639 --> 09:31.071
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'RE REALLY MARRIED!

09:43.013 --> 09:45.255
BABE.

09:47.257 --> 09:50.120
WHO'S BEEN SMOKING
ON THE...

09:50.120 --> 09:53.193
HEY, JACK.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.095
NICE DAY FOR A SAIL,
HUH?

10:11.281 --> 10:12.142
WELL, I HATE TO INTERRUPT
THE HONEYMOON,

10:12.142 --> 10:13.313
BUT THIS REALLY COULDN'T WAIT.

10:13.313 --> 10:14.685
OKAY. WHATEVER IT IS,
PUT THE GUN DOWN,

10:14.685 --> 10:15.846
AND LET'S TALK.

10:15.846 --> 10:17.047
SORRY, J.P., NO CAN DO.

10:17.047 --> 10:18.218
YOU FORCED MY HAND
WHEN YOU GOT CONRAD

10:18.218 --> 10:20.220
TO BACK OUT OF OUR DEAL.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.321
HE SAYS YOU TWO IDIOTS

10:21.321 --> 10:22.853
HAVE GOT SOME KIND
OF LEVERAGE OVER HIM.

10:22.853 --> 10:24.294
WHAT LEVERAGE?

10:24.294 --> 10:26.156
A FRIEND LENT ME THE MONEY
TO BUY HIM OUT. END OF STORY.

10:26.156 --> 10:28.258
NOT ACCORDING TO GRAYSON.

10:28.258 --> 10:29.399
SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY'S
GETTING PLAYED.

10:29.399 --> 10:31.001

CHARLOTTE. HELLO, DECLAN.

19:43.383 --> 19:44.854
HELLO.

19:44.854 --> 19:47.387
I'VE COME TO INVITE YOU
TO THE HOUSE.

19:47.387 --> 19:50.260
IT'S THE END OF SUMMER, AND IT
SEEMS WE'VE BARELY SEEN YOU.

19:50.260 --> 19:52.862
AND TONIGHT'S
OUR ANNUAL LABOR DAY PARTY.

19:52.862 --> 19:55.425
AND THINGS JUST WOULD NOT
BE THE SAME WITHOUT YOU THERE.

19:55.425 --> 19:59.369
OH, SHE NEEDS ME
FOR ANOTHER PUBLICITY STUNT.

19:59.369 --> 20:00.500
TAKE HIM.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.972
OKAY. HEY.

20:02.972 --> 20:05.475
YOU'VE WASTED YOUR TIME
COMING HERE.

20:05.475 --> 20:07.877
DAD ONLY NEEDS
THE GRAYSON FAMILY BY HIS SIDE.

20:07.877 --> 20:09.539
AND I'M A CLARKE NOW,

20:09.539 --> 20:11.511
SOMETHING TO BE ASHAMED OF.

20:11.511 --> 20:13.313
NOW IF YOU RECALL,

20:13.313 --> 20:15.515
AFTER OUR LAST PUBLICITY STUNT,

20:15.515 --> 20:17.787
I EMBRACED YOUR PATERNITY.

20:17.787 --> 20:19.289
AND I CAN SEE
THAT YOU'VE INHERITED

20:19.289 --> 20:21.351
FAR MORE THAN DAVID'S SURNAME.

20:21.351 --> 20:25.655
I'M NOT ASHAMED OF YOU, DARLING.
I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU.

20:25.655 --> 20:27.297
WELL, I APPRECIATE
THE SENTIMENT.

20:27.297 --> 20:30.360
BUT I'M SORRY. I CAN'T FAKE
ANY MORE GRAYSON SMILES.

20:30.360 --> 20:31.701
OH, CHARLOTTE, PLEASE.

20:31.701 --> 20:33.363
IF NOT
FOR YOUR FATHER'S BENEFIT,

20:33.363 --> 20:35.335
DO IT FOR
THAT OVERHEATED INFANT.

20:35.335 --> 20:36.636
IT'S CLEAR
THAT HE NEEDS A QUIET,

20:36.636 --> 20:38.408
TEMPERATURE-CONTROLLED SPACE.

20:38.408 --> 20:40.610
DECLAN CAN ATTEST
TO HOW DIFFICULT IT IS

20:40.610 --> 20:42.872
TO FIND A REPAIRMAN
ON LABOR DAY.

20:42.872 --> 20:45.615
(crying)
 YEAH, SHE'S RIGHT ABOUT THAT,
AND LOOK, HE NEEDS REST,

20:45.615 --> 20:46.776
AND SO DO YOU.

20:46.776 --> 20:49.248
AND I GOTTA GET
BACK DOWNSTAIRS.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.551
FINE, BUT ONLY IF DECLAN
CAN JOIN US

20:51.551 --> 20:53.252
AFTER HE FINISHES
HIS SHIFT.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.354
OF COURSE.

20:54.354 --> 20:55.925
(continues crying)
 YEAH, THANK YOU.

20:55.925 --> 20:58.458
I'LL GET CARL'S THINGS.

21:02.031 --> 21:05.034
(Carl crying)

21:17.347 --> 21:20.850
(Aiden) THE INITIATIVE
DRAWS YOU IN WITH FALSE HOPE.

21:20.850 --> 21:22.682
BY THE TIME
I GOT CLOSE ENOUGH,

21:22.682 --> 21:25.415
IT WAS
TOO LATE TO SAVE COLLEEN.

21:25.415 --> 21:27.286
I'M SO SORRY.

21:27.286 --> 21:30.059
LOOK, I'M NOT TELLING YOU THIS
TO SCARE YOU.

21:30.059 --> 21:33.563
OKAY? I'VE BEEN WHERE YOU ARE.
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

21:33.563 --> 21:35.425
AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT
I CAN GET YOU OUT OF THIS

21:35.425 --> 21:36.726
WITHOUT ENDANGERING
YOUR FATHER.

21:36.726 --> 21:38.728
BUT FIRST WE NEED TO BE
ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN

21:38.728 --> 21:40.069
THAT HE'S STILL ALIVE.

21:40.069 --> 21:41.831
HOW DO WE DO THAT?

21:43.302 --> 21:46.736
FIND HELEN CROWLEY.

21:46.736 --> 21:49.379
START WITH
A SIMPLE PHONE CALL.

21:56.315 --> 22:00.620
I WANT TO TALK TO AMANDA.

22:00.620 --> 22:03.423
LET ME GIVE YOU SOME
FREE MARITAL ADVICE, J.P.

22:03.423 --> 22:04.524
SHE'S ONLY GONNA TELL YOU
MORE LIES

22:04.524 --> 22:05.855
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT WIVES DO.

22:05.855 --> 22:07.026
THEY SCREW YOU OVER.

22:07.026 --> 22:10.360
I WASN'T TALKING TO YOU.

22:10.360 --> 22:13.332
I HEARD EVERYTHING YOU SAID.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.404
IS IT TRUE?

22:14.404 --> 22:16.436
YOU WERE JUST USING ME
THE WHOLE TIME?

22:16.436 --> 22:17.807
JACK, I CAN EXPLAIN
EVERYTHING--

22:17.807 --> 22:19.108
OH, HO, HO! BY THE BOOK.

22:19.108 --> 22:20.810
YOU'VE BEEN HAD, MAN.

22:20.810 --> 22:23.843
YEAH, APPARENTLY,
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE.

22:23.843 --> 22:26.416
MEANING WHAT? HUH?

22:26.416 --> 22:27.617
SHE'S BEEN LYING TO YOU, TOO.

22:27.617 --> 22:30.119
SHE BROUGHT A LAPTOP
ON BOARD LAST NIGHT.

22:30.119 --> 22:31.481
JACK, DON'T--

22:31.481 --> 22:32.822
I SAW IT. IT'S GOTTA
BE DOWN THERE SOMEWHERE.

22:32.822 --> 22:33.983
IS THAT TRUE?

22:33.983 --> 22:35.425
NO.

22:35.425 --> 22:37.356
JACK, I SWEAR, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

22:37.356 --> 22:38.488
FOR THE FIRST TIME
SINCE I MET YOU,

22:38.488 --> 22:40.089
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I'M DOING.

22:40.089 --> 22:41.461
JACK, PLEASE--

22:41.461 --> 22:42.962
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME,
TO OUR CHILD?

22:42.962 --> 22:44.133
YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE.

22:44.133 --> 22:46.396
I'M GONNA LET YOU TWO
FIGHT IT OUT.

22:46.396 --> 22:47.967
OUT OF MY WAY.

22:49.799 --> 22:52.041
IT BETTER BE DOWN HERE,
AMANDA.

22:52.041 --> 22:54.003
(Jack) BE HONEST
FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE.

22:54.003 --> 22:55.745
IS THIS MARRIAGE
JUST A SHAM?

22:55.745 --> 22:57.106
NO.

22:57.106 --> 22:59.909
YOU'RE JUST USING ME
TO GET EVEN WITH THE GRAYSONS?

22:59.909 --> 23:01.911
JACK, WHEN I FIRST
CAME TO TOWN,

23:01.911 --> 23:03.853
I DIDN'T EXPECT TO GET TOGETHER
WITH YOU, BUT I DID.

23:03.853 --> 23:06.015
THEN CARL CAME ALONG,

23:06.015 --> 23:07.757
AND YOU WERE AMAZING AND...

23:07.757 --> 23:09.559
I SWEAR,
I CAN EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

23:09.559 --> 23:11.721
ABOUT BLACKMAILING
CONRAD GRAYSON,

23:11.721 --> 23:14.163
THREATENING TO KILL A MAN
WHILE I WAS IN PRISON?

23:14.163 --> 23:17.867
WHAT KIND OF PERSON ARE YOU?
WHAT KIND OF MOTHER ARE YOU?

23:17.867 --> 23:20.600
I DID ALL OF THAT
FOR YOU...

23:20.600 --> 23:22.001
FOR US AND CARL.

23:22.001 --> 23:23.402
LOOK, JACK.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.104
YOU'VE GIVEN MY LIFE MEANING.

23:25.104 --> 23:27.406
I LOVE YOU, JACK.
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT.

23:27.406 --> 23:28.538
(objects clatter)

23:28.538 --> 23:30.179
HEY, HEY. SAVE THE REST
FOR DIVORCE COURT.

23:30.179 --> 23:32.181
MANDY,
GET YOUR ASS DOWN HERE.

23:32.181 --> 23:34.914
YOU SHOW ME WHERE THAT COMPUTER
IS NOW. LET'S GO.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.516
LET'S GO!

23:36.516 --> 23:38.047
(lowered voice)
IT'S UNDER THE MATTRESS.

23:38.047 --> 23:40.419
COME ON!

23:40.419 --> 23:41.721
(objects thud)

23:41.721 --> 23:43.493
(sniffles)

23:43.493 --> 23:44.454
(boat creaking)

23:45.955 --> 23:47.957
IT'S IN THERE.

23:49.459 --> 23:50.900
GET IT.

24:04.974 --> 24:06.616
CAMERA'S BACK ONLINE.

24:06.616 --> 24:08.147
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

24:08.147 --> 24:09.679
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

24:09.679 --> 24:11.851
NOW!
 (hissing)

24:11.851 --> 24:13.853
HUH?
(speaks indistinctly)

24:13.853 --> 24:15.184
HEY, HEY. HEY!

24:15.184 --> 24:16.986
(hissing continues)

24:16.986 --> 24:19.088
HEY!

24:19.088 --> 24:20.630
(grunts)

24:20.630 --> 24:22.231
LET'S GO. LET'S GO.

24:33.503 --> 24:34.974
(grunts)

24:40.810 --> 24:42.111
(gasps) JACK!

24:42.111 --> 24:43.482
OH, GOD.

24:43.482 --> 24:44.253
OH. OHH.

24:44.253 --> 24:45.815
(pants)

24:45.815 --> 24:47.156
OH, MY GOD.

24:47.156 --> 24:48.217
(Amanda) JACK!

24:48.217 --> 24:51.621
(Nolan)
I THINK HE SHOT JACK.

24:51.621 --> 24:53.122
COME ON, JACK.
WE HAVE TO HURRY.

24:53.122 --> 24:54.994
(groans)

24:54.994 --> 24:56.225
(moans)

24:56.225 --> 24:57.597
(wood crunches)

24:57.597 --> 25:01.200
(grunting)

25:01.200 --> 25:02.902
(panting)
 WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

25:02.902 --> 25:04.233
SAVING YOU.

25:04.233 --> 25:05.504
AMANDA...

25:05.504 --> 25:06.876
I LOVE YOU, JACK.

25:06.876 --> 25:08.037
NO.

25:08.037 --> 25:10.239
AMANDA. NO!
 (wood crunches)

25:10.239 --> 25:14.043
(pants)

25:15.184 --> 25:17.146
(grunts)

25:17.146 --> 25:18.117
WHERE IS HE?
 NO!

25:18.117 --> 25:20.089
(shouts indistinctly)

25:20.089 --> 25:21.250
(grunts)

25:21.250 --> 25:23.122
(pants)

25:26.155 --> 25:27.957
DAMN IT!

25:33.663 --> 25:35.034
(jazz music playing)

25:35.034 --> 25:38.938
VICTORIA, MAY I SAY,
YOU ARE POSITIVELY RADIANT

25:38.938 --> 25:40.710
IN YOUR NATURAL ELEMENT?

25:40.710 --> 25:42.011
YOU MEAN IN THE MIDST
OF A CRISIS

25:42.011 --> 25:43.673
OR WITH BLOOD ON MY HANDS?

25:43.673 --> 25:44.974
NO, I MEAN, IN THAT DRESS

25:44.974 --> 25:48.848
AT ONE OF YOUR
WICKEDLY EXTRAVAGANT SOIREES.

25:48.848 --> 25:52.551
CONRAD, YOUR GALL
NEVER CEASES TO REPULSE ME.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.884
OVERT FLATTERY ASIDE,

25:54.884 --> 25:56.856
THIS EXTRAVAGANT SOIREE
MARKS NOT ONLY

25:56.856 --> 25:59.058
THE BEGINNING OF YOUR
FARCICAL POLITICAL CAREER...

25:59.058 --> 26:01.060
OH.
 BUT THE END OF SUMMER,

26:01.060 --> 26:02.732
AND THEREFORE,
OUR PERSONAL ENTANGLEMENT.

26:02.732 --> 26:03.993
YOU AND I HAD A DEAL.

26:03.993 --> 26:05.334
OH, NO, NO, NO, MY PET.

26:05.334 --> 26:07.166
YOU MADE A PROCLAMATION
THAT I NEVER AGREED TO.

26:07.166 --> 26:09.298
AND LESS YOU'VE FORGOTTEN,

26:09.298 --> 26:13.142
WE CAN'T POSSIBLY DISENTANGLE
FROM ONE ANOTHER NOW.

26:13.142 --> 26:14.944
BECAUSE OF LAST NIGHT?

26:14.944 --> 26:16.245
WELL, THERE IS THAT.

26:16.245 --> 26:19.148
AND BECAUSE VOTERS WORSHIP
FAMILY VALUES,

26:19.148 --> 26:22.181
AND WITHOUT YOU AT MY SIDE,
MY AMBITIONS WILL FAIL.

26:22.181 --> 26:24.053
YOU KNOW FULL WELL
I COULD GIVE A WHIT

26:24.053 --> 26:25.885
ABOUT
YOUR PERSONAL AMBITIONS.

26:25.885 --> 26:30.019
OH, BUT YOU DO GIVE A WHIT
ABOUT OUR SON.

26:30.019 --> 26:33.723
SO LET'S PRESS THE FLESH,
SHALL WE?

26:37.196 --> 26:41.030
(indistinct conversations)

26:51.981 --> 26:54.984
(motor whirring)

26:56.045 --> 26:57.687
(inhales sharply)

26:57.687 --> 27:00.920
(boat creaking)

27:20.409 --> 27:23.412
(motor whirring)

27:27.046 --> 27:29.849
(Emily) ANY SIGN OF JACK?
 (Nolan) NO. NOT YET.

27:31.951 --> 27:35.084
KEEP LOOKING.
HE'S GOTTA BE CLOSE.

27:38.888 --> 27:41.691
(beeping)

27:41.691 --> 27:44.834
WAIT. N-NATE'S TURNING
THE BOAT AROUND.

27:44.834 --> 27:45.965
HE'S PROBABLY
GOING BACK FOR JACK.

27:45.965 --> 27:48.367
WE HAVE TO GET TO HIM FIRST.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.709
(grunts)

27:59.709 --> 28:02.852
(water splashing)

28:16.095 --> 28:18.097
LET'S KEEP THIS
OUR LITTLE SECRET, SHALL WE?

28:18.097 --> 28:19.969
(laughs)

28:19.969 --> 28:23.072
MY, UH, COMPLIMENTS
ON A LOVELY EVENING.

28:23.072 --> 28:26.305
OH, ALL CREDIT
TO MY WIFE, MISTER...

28:26.305 --> 28:27.877
CALL ME TRASK.

28:27.877 --> 28:29.038
TRASK.

28:29.038 --> 28:30.780
I WAS HOPING TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS

28:30.780 --> 28:32.011
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

28:32.011 --> 28:33.712
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
WE DO.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.214
THIS IS A PRIVATE FUNCTION,

28:35.214 --> 28:37.316
AND WE SPECIFICALLY
EXCLUDED THE PRESS.

28:37.316 --> 28:40.019
I'M NOT A REPORTER,
MRS. GRAYSON.

28:40.019 --> 28:41.190
WELL, THEN...

28:41.190 --> 28:42.892
HOW CAN WE HELP YOU?

28:42.892 --> 28:45.154
YOU CAN START BY TELLING ME

28:45.154 --> 28:48.798
WHAT HAPPENED
TO HELEN CROWLEY.

28:51.200 --> 28:55.204
AFTER MS. CROWLEY'S DRIVER
DROPPED HER AT HOME,

28:55.204 --> 28:58.207
HER PHONE WAS SWITCHED OFF,
AND WE LOST CONTACT.

28:58.207 --> 29:00.109
HOW VEXING FOR YOU.

29:01.310 --> 29:03.012
AND YOU.

29:03.012 --> 29:05.975
HER DRIVER CONFIRMED THAT
SHE WAS HERE BEFORE THAT,

29:05.975 --> 29:08.217
MEETING WITH YOU,
MRS. GRAYSON.

29:08.217 --> 29:09.748
THAT'S RIGHT.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.050
I PROPOSED A TRADE--

29:11.050 --> 29:12.782
THE EVIDENCE
I HAD BEEN HOLDING

29:12.782 --> 29:13.953
IN EXCHANGE FOR HER ASSURANCE

29:13.953 --> 29:15.084
THAT MY SON
WOULD NOT BE HARMED.

29:15.084 --> 29:17.787
HELEN CROWLEY
DOESN'T NEGOTIATE.

29:17.787 --> 29:19.859
YOU KNOW, I'M WONDERING
IF HER DISAPPEARANCE

29:19.859 --> 29:22.862
IS SOMEHOW RELATED TO
THE OTHER THORN IN OUR SIDE.

29:24.063 --> 29:25.534
UH, DAVID CLARKE'S DAUGHTER
AMANDA.

29:25.534 --> 29:27.937
SHE'S OUR PERPETUAL TORMENTOR.

29:27.937 --> 29:29.468
WHAT LEVERAGE
DOES SHE HAVE?

29:29.468 --> 29:31.070
WELL, THE COPIES
OF THE FEDERAL EVIDENCE

29:31.070 --> 29:34.473
YOUR PEOPLE FAILED TO DESTROY
IN LAST SPRING'S PLANE CRASH.

29:34.473 --> 29:36.045
IT SEEMS OUR PEOPLE FAILED

29:36.045 --> 29:38.848
AT ANY NUMBER OF INTENTIONS
THAT EVENING.

29:38.848 --> 29:40.980
OH, WASN'T I THE LUCKY ONE?

29:40.980 --> 29:42.982
AND HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE
A GIRL LIKE THAT

29:42.982 --> 29:45.784
CAME TO POSSESS
SUCH INCENDIARY MATERIAL?

29:45.784 --> 29:48.057
WELL, YOUR FORMER HENCHMAN
GORDON MURPHY.

29:48.057 --> 29:50.319
HE WAS MARRIED TO HER MOTHER,
AFTER ALL.

29:50.319 --> 29:53.923
ANYWAY, VICTORIA MADE HELEN
AWARE OF THE THREAT

29:53.923 --> 29:55.394
AS PART OF OUR DETENTE,

29:55.394 --> 29:57.396
AND HELEN ASSURED HER
THAT AMANDA CLARKE

29:57.396 --> 29:58.998
WOULD POSE
NO FURTHER PROBLEMS.

29:58.998 --> 30:00.329
AND THEN?

30:00.329 --> 30:03.432
AND THEN I TOLD HER TO GET
THE HELL OUT OF MY HOUSE.

30:03.432 --> 30:05.334
NOW, MR. TRASK,

30:05.334 --> 30:08.938
I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU
TO FOLLOW THAT ADVICE.

30:28.227 --> 30:30.829
(gasps) EMS, I SEE HIM.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.501
I SEE HIM.

30:32.501 --> 30:35.304
(downshifts)

30:35.304 --> 30:38.307
(pants) HE'S NOT MOVING.

JACK?

31:15.344 --> 31:17.876

(Nolan grunts)

31:19.979 --> 31:21.981
(grunts)

31:21.981 --> 31:25.154
(panting) NOLAN,
THERE'S NO EXIT WOUND.

31:26.986 --> 31:29.158
YOU HAVE TO GET HIM
TO A HOSPITAL.

31:31.220 --> 31:33.923
NOLAN, I NEED TO KNOW
THAT YOU CAN DO THIS.

31:33.923 --> 31:35.564
EMS, IT'S JACK.

31:35.564 --> 31:37.466
I WILL DO EVERYTHING
 THAT I CAN,

31:37.466 --> 31:39.999
BUT WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

31:39.999 --> 31:41.470
I CAN'T LEAVE AMANDA.

31:43.002 --> 31:45.034
EMS!

32:59.108 --> 33:00.979
Helen, it's Padma.

33:00.979 --> 33:03.052
I've located Carrion,
 but the program is incomplete.

33:03.052 --> 33:05.054
Nolan's the only one
 who can complete it,

33:05.054 --> 33:07.216
and I'm the only one
 who can convince him to.

33:07.216 --> 33:09.218
But I won't
 until you send me proof

33:09.218 --> 33:11.460
that my father is still alive.

33:11.460 --> 33:13.162

33:47.196 --> 33:49.528
YOU SO MUCH AS BLINK,
AND YOU'RE DEAD.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.060
WE HAVE TO GET JACK.

33:51.060 --> 33:53.162
HE'S SAFE.
JUST GET ON THE BOAT.

33:54.303 --> 33:55.434
OH!

34:17.626 --> 34:18.786
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

34:18.786 --> 34:20.228
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW.

34:20.228 --> 34:21.389

34:21.389 --> 34:24.062
AH! (grunts) AH!

HOLD ON A SECOND.

34:52.321 --> 34:54.193
AMANDA, NO!

34:54.193 --> 34:55.364
COME ON.

34:55.364 --> 34:57.226

34:57.226 --> 34:58.467
NO!

34:58.467 --> 34:59.828
EMILY, GET DOWN!

35:24.553 --> 35:26.655

36:09.167 --> 36:10.569
HELEN?

36:10.569 --> 36:11.900
(Trask)
Helen's no longer with us,

36:11.900 --> 36:13.602
but your orders remain.

36:13.602 --> 36:15.604
Deliver the program
in its finished form,

36:15.604 --> 36:17.506
or your father dies.

36:17.506 --> 36:19.778
BEFORE I DO ANYTHING ELSE,

36:19.778 --> 36:21.810
I NEED PROOF THAT YOU HAVEN'T
KILLED HIM ALREADY.

36:21.810 --> 36:25.314
I BELIEVE
YOU JUST SIGNED FOR IT.

36:25.314 --> 36:27.316
FEEL FREE TO CHECK
THE FINGERPRINT.

ON THIS LABOR DAY.

37:17.536 --> 37:20.669
(guests chuckle)
 WITH THE BLESSINGS AND SUPPORT
OF MY WIFE AND CHILDREN,

37:20.669 --> 37:22.371
I HAVE DECIDED TO ANNOUNCE

37:22.371 --> 37:23.942

COMES BACK WITH THE BOAT.

37:59.408 --> 38:01.310
(panting)

38:01.310 --> 38:03.982
JUST TRY TO BE STILL.
SAVE YOUR ENERGY.

38:34.343 --> 38:38.347
OH, MY GOD.
I'M SO SORRY.

38:38.347 --> 38:40.749

38:40.749 --> 38:42.421
YOU'VE GIVEN ME
THE ONE THING

38:42.421 --> 38:44.593
THAT I THOUGHT
I'D NEVER HAVE...

38:46.595 --> 38:48.056
A REAL FAMILY.

38:48.056 --> 38:51.360
(continues crying)

38:54.963 --> 38:57.335

38:57.335 --> 39:01.069

39:01.069 --> 39:04.072
I'LL BE BACK FOR THIS.

39:04.072 --> 39:07.115
AND I'LL BE BACK
FOR YOU, TOO.

39:07.115 --> 39:09.818
I PROMISE.

39:11.680 --> 39:13.051
AMANDA, WAIT.

39:17.386 --> 39:19.127
WE'RE SISTERS, RIGHT?

39:19.127 --> 39:21.089
RIGHT.

39:22.531 --> 39:23.732
(sniffles)

39:26.395 --> 39:29.438
(crying)
I LOVE YOU.

39:29.438 --> 39:31.740

39:42.050 --> 39:43.712
OH, GOD, NO.

39:43.712 --> 39:45.684
AMANDA.

39:45.684 --> 39:47.385
(continues crying)
OH, GOD.

39:47.385 --> 39:48.917
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

39:48.917 --> 39:50.419
NO. (sniffles)

39:50.419 --> 39:51.920

40:01.169 --> 40:04.172

40:12.140 --> 40:15.113
IT'S FINALLY COOLING OFF.

40:15.113 --> 40:17.816
MERCIFULLY.

40:19.548 --> 40:23.051
I LOOK FORWARD
TO THE CHANGE OF SEASON.

40:24.092 --> 40:25.794
SWEETHEART,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

40:25.794 --> 40:28.457
WHAT KIND OF QUESTION
IS THAT?

40:28.457 --> 40:30.428
OF COURSE HE IS.

40:30.428 --> 40:34.903
WE ALL ARE, MY DEAR,
THANKS TO YOU.

40:34.903 --> 40:37.065
HOW ARE WE GONNA LIVE
WITH THIS?

40:37.065 --> 40:39.938
LIKE WE ALWAYS DO.

40:39.938 --> 40:43.572
WE GO ABOUT OUR LIVES
AS IF NOTHING EVER HAPPENED.

40:45.113 --> 40:47.576
AND WHAT ABOUT AMANDA CLARKE?

40:49.117 --> 40:51.750
POOR GIRL.

40:51.750 --> 40:54.182
SHE CHOSE THE WRONG ENEMY.

41:09.067 --> 41:12.801
SACRIFICE DEMANDS THE SURRENDER
 OF THINGS WE CHERISH

41:12.801 --> 41:15.504
ABOVE ALL ELSE.

41:19.007 --> 41:20.148
(crying)

41:20.148 --> 41:22.551
ONLY OUT OF THE AGONY
 OF THOSE LOSSES

41:22.551 --> 41:25.554
CAN A NEW RESOLUTION BE BORN...

41:30.559 --> 41:35.493
AN UNDYING DEVOTION TO A CAUSE
 GREATER THAN ONE'S SELF...

41:36.895 --> 41:39.898
(crying)

41:44.202 --> 41:47.606
EMILY!

41:55.113 --> 41:57.085
(Nolan) EMILY!

42:00.689 --> 42:04.122
AND A MORAL DUTY
 TO SEE A JOURNEY THROUGH...

42:08.196 --> 42:09.157
(pops)

42:09.157 --> 42:11.199
(flare hisses)

42:11.199 --> 42:14.232
TO ITS ABSOLUTE COMPLETION.
