- Yeah. Well, I'm just still
trying to figure out

09:06.313 --> 09:08.279
Where that line is, I guess.

09:08.315 --> 09:10.448
- Why don't we go for a ride
together

09:10.450 --> 09:11.983
And afterwards,
I'll run some tests,

09:12.118 --> 09:14.185
See where he's at.
- Yeah. Okay,

09:14.221 --> 09:16.321
That sounds great.
- Okay.

09:16.456 --> 09:21.392
♪♪♪

09:21.428 --> 09:25.063
(hooves thunder,
spartan and shadow grunt)

09:25.065 --> 09:31.069
♪♪♪

09:31.138 --> 09:33.071
(hooves thud lightly
grass rustles)

09:33.140 --> 09:35.139
- Well, I'm impressed.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.609
He's keepin' up with, uh,
shadow, no problem.

09:37.678 --> 09:40.277
- Yeah, and he wants to keep
goin'. (chuckles)

09:40.314 --> 09:41.680
- Well, so far,

09:41.682 --> 09:44.148
Spartan looks like
he's in pretty good shape.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.283
I think if he wants to keep
going, you should let him.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.219
It's your call.
- Yeah, let's do it.

09:48.221 --> 09:50.021
- Okay.

09:50.023 --> 09:51.789
Hup!
(hooves thud)

09:53.093 --> 09:54.926
(pole clinks)

09:54.928 --> 09:58.429
- (sighs) mom, I think we're
missing one of the tent poles.

09:58.465 --> 10:00.431
- What? Are you serious?

10:00.467 --> 10:02.967
- Yeah.
- (sighs)

10:03.036 --> 10:05.837
- So, what do we do now?

10:05.906 --> 10:07.639
- It's okay.
It's-it's no problem.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.507
We'll just um...

10:09.576 --> 10:12.911
We'll replace the tent pole
with a... With a branch.

10:13.046 --> 10:15.380
We just need to figure out a
way to attach it to the frame.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.516
- Duct tape?

10:18.585 --> 10:20.051
- (snaps fingers)
that's a great idea.

10:20.053 --> 10:22.187
Okay, I'll find a branch,
you get the duct tape.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.456
- Sure. Uh, where'd you put it?

10:24.458 --> 10:26.991
- I didn't bring any.
Did you?

10:27.027 --> 10:29.461
- You were the one who was
going on about being prepared.

10:29.463 --> 10:30.862
- (sighs)

10:30.864 --> 10:33.865
No problem.
So we're down a tent pole.

10:33.867 --> 10:36.467
It's not the end of the world,
right?

10:36.536 --> 10:38.002
We'll figure it out.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.471
(sighs)

10:41.775 --> 10:43.875
<i> Amy: So, scott did a full</i>
<i> check-up and lameness test</i>

10:43.877 --> 10:45.410
On spartan today.
- Oh yeah?

10:45.545 --> 10:47.478
How's he lookin', scott?
- Oh, great!

10:47.547 --> 10:50.281
He's in better shape than a lot
of horses half his age.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.349
- Well, good.
Sounds like old spartan's

10:52.386 --> 10:54.285
Getting a new lease on life.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.220
- This is all over a pair
of shoes?

10:56.289 --> 10:57.722
They must be magical shoes.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.957
- Dad, they're not magical.
It's just,

10:59.993 --> 11:01.693
This is about conditioning
and maintenance

11:01.762 --> 11:03.961
And the more I do with spartan
without him being sore,

11:03.997 --> 11:05.897
The stronger he gets.
- You know, amy,

11:05.899 --> 11:07.699
There's an endurance race
this weekend

11:07.768 --> 11:09.434
Over at the williamsdale ranch.

11:09.503 --> 11:10.702
You should think
about entering.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.537
- (scoffs)
- are you serious?

11:12.539 --> 11:14.705
- It's a 50-mile race,
mostly just for fun.

11:14.707 --> 11:16.241
- Spartan's a geriatric horse.

11:16.376 --> 11:17.975
He shouldn't be entering
a race.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.378
- My client, she just won
a big endurance race

11:20.447 --> 11:23.047
<i> Down in the states.</i>
<i> Her horse is 27 years old.</i>

11:23.083 --> 11:26.518
- See? There ya go, tim.
Just 'cause you're getting old

11:26.520 --> 11:28.385
Doesn't mean you're all
washed up.

11:28.422 --> 11:29.721
(chuckles)

11:31.858 --> 11:33.991
- (vrooming)
- okay, you two,

11:34.027 --> 11:36.194
Come on, sit down for dinner.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.062
(footsteps approach)

11:38.098 --> 11:41.466
- So, how is spartan
gonna win this race?

11:41.601 --> 11:43.268
He can barely gallop anymore.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.069
- Well, the point wouldn't be
to win,

11:45.138 --> 11:46.738
Just to challenge spartan.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.640
- I'm still worried about
his arthritis.

11:49.676 --> 11:51.376
- I'm working as one
of the vets.

11:51.511 --> 11:53.745
We check the horses
every 20 miles or so.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.947
I wouldn't let spartan,
or any of the other horses,

11:56.082 --> 11:58.149
Continue if they weren't
completely sound.

11:58.284 --> 12:01.486
But it's totally up to you,
amy. No pressure.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.521
- Why don't you enter shadow?
He's a lot faster.

12:03.523 --> 12:05.089
- Nah, the endurance race

12:05.092 --> 12:07.057
Is not about being fast.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.995
It's about playing
the long game.

12:12.499 --> 12:13.898
(door bangs shut)
- hey,

12:13.900 --> 12:16.033
Thanks for your help today.
I really appreciate it.

12:16.069 --> 12:19.103
- (exhales) yeah, no problem.
Had a really good time.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.705
Good night.
- Good night.

12:21.742 --> 12:22.940
- Hey, amy?

12:22.976 --> 12:25.109
You know, you should really
enter that race.

12:25.178 --> 12:27.411
I bet you and spartan would
kick some serious butt.

12:27.481 --> 12:30.582
- Well, thank you.
I'm not so sure about that.

12:30.584 --> 12:33.651
- Remember what you told me
about working with horses?

12:33.653 --> 12:37.555
You know, being confident,
not doubting yourself.

12:37.591 --> 12:40.591
Maybe you should take
your own advice.

12:40.627 --> 12:43.127
(bike clicks away)

12:44.197 --> 12:45.596
- (sighs)

12:45.632 --> 12:47.198
Lou: (sighs)

12:47.200 --> 12:49.534
The tent is a little sad
looking, but...

12:49.536 --> 12:51.803
How 'bout this dinner?
Pretty great, huh?

12:51.938 --> 12:53.471
- It's delicious.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.472
I've never had food like this
on a camping trip before.

12:55.509 --> 12:58.810
- Oh, I'm so glad you like it.
- We should probably hurry up

12:58.879 --> 13:00.812
And finish eating
before it gets too dark.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.780
We still need to hang food up
in a bear bag.

13:02.783 --> 13:04.082
- Oh, no, no, no,
don't worry about it.

13:04.217 --> 13:06.551
We'll just throw everything
in the suv when we're done.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.887
- But dad and I always hang
food up in a bear bag.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.754
- Trust me, there is no way

13:10.791 --> 13:12.357
That a bear is getting
into the car.

13:12.492 --> 13:15.626
Just enjoy your meal.
No need to rush.

13:17.164 --> 13:18.762
(mugs clink)

13:20.700 --> 13:22.100
- Mmm...

13:23.203 --> 13:24.803
(footsteps thud lightly)

13:24.938 --> 13:27.171
- Hey. (chuckles)

13:27.174 --> 13:28.639
(spartan nickers)

13:28.675 --> 13:30.107
We've been through
a lot together, haven't we?

13:30.143 --> 13:31.910
(spartan nickers)
- (chuckles)

13:32.045 --> 13:33.444
What do you say?

13:33.513 --> 13:34.913
Are you up for one more
challenge?

13:35.048 --> 13:37.514
(spartan nickers)
- yeah? Okay. Okay.

13:37.551 --> 13:39.016
You rest up, all right?

13:40.119 --> 13:42.186
We've got a race
to get ready for.

13:42.189 --> 13:43.787
(spartan nickers)

13:49.930 --> 13:52.397
Job is
to meet me at each checkpoint

13:52.532 --> 13:54.599
And make sure that spartan
has plenty of water,

13:54.668 --> 13:56.067
And that he's cooled down.

13:56.136 --> 13:58.636
- All right, so I'm like your,
uh, your pit crew.

13:58.705 --> 14:00.104
- Yeah, exactly.

14:00.140 --> 14:02.607
- Well, how am I supposed
to get to every checkpoint?

14:02.742 --> 14:04.141
I can't drive.
(truck rumbles)

14:04.143 --> 14:06.077
- Well, that's why I invited
my dad.

14:06.146 --> 14:07.879
(spartan nickers,
engine shuts off, door slams)

14:07.948 --> 14:11.416
- Oh, I'm here. Still think
this race is a crazy idea.

14:11.418 --> 14:14.151
- Yes, I know you do,
but I appreciate it.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.354
I'm gonna go get registered.

14:16.423 --> 14:18.623
(logan's phone rings)

14:24.064 --> 14:26.865
- Are you gonna get that?
- Uh, no.

14:29.902 --> 14:30.935
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.971
- Amy! Hey!
- Evan!

14:32.973 --> 14:35.372
- What a nice surprise.
- Yeah.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.108
- So, are you here cheering
somebody on?

14:37.177 --> 14:40.244
'cause I hope it's me.
- Um, I'm actually competing.

14:40.313 --> 14:42.914
- Oh! Oh, I didn't know
you were an endurance racer.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.249
- Well, I'm not, really.
This is my first race.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.986
- Oh, okay. Well, you picked
a good one to start with.

14:47.988 --> 14:50.187
It's only 50 miles.
Should be a piece of cake.

14:50.257 --> 14:52.856
I mean, I doubt my horse
is even gonna break a sweat.

14:52.893 --> 14:54.659
I did tell you about my new
horse, right? Fire season?

14:54.728 --> 14:56.594
- Yeah, I think you mentioned
it at the pub.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.329
- Well, look, if you need
any tips,

14:58.464 --> 15:00.531
I've got a lot of experience
doing these races, so.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.600
- Yeah, you might've mentioned
that too,

15:02.602 --> 15:04.202
But I think I'm good.
- Okay.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.770
Well, if you change your mind,
let me know.

15:08.141 --> 15:09.941
- That kid is such a blow-hard.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.676
- (laughs)

15:11.811 --> 15:13.210
Caleb, what're you doin' here?

15:13.246 --> 15:15.612
- Well, I dabble
in endurance races.

15:15.649 --> 15:17.081
- You dabble?
- Yeah.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.951
I thought, why not enter one
for old time's sake.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.752
- Mm-hmm.

15:21.788 --> 15:23.554
Sounds like a bit
of a coincidence to me.

15:23.690 --> 15:26.223
- Okay, maybe tim put the bug
in my ear. (laughs)

15:26.293 --> 15:28.292
Hope you don't mind a little
friendly competition?

15:28.295 --> 15:30.027
- No, I don't mind at all.

15:30.096 --> 15:33.698
- And the best part is,
we can both kick evan's butt.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.766
- (sighs) look, I just hope
I finish the race.

15:35.835 --> 15:39.336
I'm not here to beat evan.
- Well, I am.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.572
The way he gloated after that
lumberjack competition,

15:41.608 --> 15:43.975
Can't wait to wipe that
smug grin off his face.

15:44.044 --> 15:46.777
- (chuckles and sighs)

15:49.182 --> 15:51.582
(footsteps crunch)

15:52.652 --> 15:53.985
(hatch clicks open)

15:55.121 --> 15:57.121
What the...?

15:57.157 --> 15:58.322
(mouse squeaks)

15:58.325 --> 16:01.192
- Oh! Oh! Shoo! Get out!
Oh my gosh! Ew!

16:02.328 --> 16:03.761
- What is it? What's wrong?

16:03.830 --> 16:05.663
- Oh, there was a mouse
in the car!

16:05.665 --> 16:07.331
God, how did it get in there?

16:07.400 --> 16:09.600
- I guess bear bags aren't
only for bears.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.002
- (sighs)

16:11.071 --> 16:13.871
Oh, got into the bread.
(bread thumps)

16:13.940 --> 16:17.875
Ugh! All of our vegetables
and our herbs are ruined!

16:18.011 --> 16:20.611
All of my meals.
What're we gonna do?

16:20.747 --> 16:22.613
- Well, the...

16:22.682 --> 16:24.281
Granola bars are still good.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.285
And we still have... These.

16:28.421 --> 16:32.023
- Ugh. Great. Hot dogs.
It's perfect.

16:33.459 --> 16:35.392
(birds chirp)

16:38.498 --> 16:40.464
(flag rustles gently)

16:42.402 --> 16:44.235
- See that?
(blue snorts gently)

16:44.370 --> 16:46.504
- See that?

16:46.573 --> 16:49.507
(flag rustles,
blue snorts gently)

16:49.576 --> 16:51.108
Get up here. Step up.
(blue whinnies)

16:51.177 --> 16:53.111
Get around there.
Get around there.

16:53.246 --> 16:55.313
That-a boy, atta boy.
Hoo, hoo.

16:56.416 --> 16:59.316
Hoo.
(blue snorts gently)

17:01.354 --> 17:03.387
Yep. Yep.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.289
(blue snorts gently,
hooves thud)

17:05.425 --> 17:06.891
Hoo.

17:09.529 --> 17:12.029
(jack clucks his tongue,
blue grunts gently)

17:12.032 --> 17:13.831
Hoo, hoo, hoo.
(grunting intensifies)

17:13.966 --> 17:16.100
Yep. Yep, get over there.

17:16.236 --> 17:18.269
(blue neighs)

17:18.338 --> 17:20.304
(jack clucks his tongue)
hoo...

17:22.709 --> 17:24.942
Doin' good, blue.

17:25.078 --> 17:27.344
Doin' real good.
(chuckles)

17:27.380 --> 17:29.080
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
(blue snorts softly)

17:29.149 --> 17:30.781
Easy.

17:30.817 --> 17:33.484
- So, it's mostly forested
trails in this part

17:33.619 --> 17:35.753
Just before the first
vet check.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.254
So, you can make up
some ground there.

17:37.256 --> 17:40.257
That's assuming spartan even
passes the first vet check.

17:40.259 --> 17:42.893
- Wow, you really know how
to give a good pep talk.

17:42.929 --> 17:44.495
- (chuckles)
- these races aren't easy.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.897
(logan's phone rings)

17:46.933 --> 17:48.900
- Oh.
(phone keeps ringing)

17:48.902 --> 17:51.902
- Are we keeping you
from something important?

17:51.938 --> 17:53.971
- No, sorry.

17:54.107 --> 17:55.640
- 'kay, let's go over
the second leg.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.243
(blue pants softly)

18:00.346 --> 18:02.113
(snorts nervously)

18:02.182 --> 18:04.014
(blue whinnies wildly)
- whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy now.

18:04.050 --> 18:05.182
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:05.218 --> 18:08.785
(blue whinnies wildly,
hooves thud)

18:10.256 --> 18:12.723
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa... Whoa.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.325
(blue snorts)
