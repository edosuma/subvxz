00:00.023 --> 00:02.093
- Previously on "Timeless"...
- Connor Mason?

00:02.118 --> 00:04.726
I think he's hiding something from
us and I want to know what it is.

00:04.751 --> 00:07.006
You need to understand how deep I'm in

00:07.031 --> 00:08.584
with these Rittenhouse people.

00:08.609 --> 00:11.904
You know something about
secretly recording people.

00:11.929 --> 00:13.613
I didn't know you were married.

00:13.615 --> 00:16.349
Jessica died. It was my fault.

00:16.351 --> 00:19.218
Apparently I'm engaged.
I've never met him before.

00:19.220 --> 00:23.256
I'm... I'm gonna go stay with my
mom for a few days... or weeks.

00:23.258 --> 00:27.170
If you need to spend some time,
figure things out first, do it.

00:45.513 --> 00:47.513
You've read the story of Jesse James

00:47.515 --> 00:49.515
and how he lived and died.

00:49.517 --> 00:52.106
If you're still in need
of something to read,

00:52.131 --> 00:55.087
here's the story of Bonnie and Clyde.

00:56.272 --> 00:57.924
You got engine trouble?

01:35.997 --> 01:37.296
What?

01:37.298 --> 01:38.364
Oh, come on.

01:38.366 --> 01:39.799
"Come on" what?

01:39.801 --> 01:41.505
You did not cook this yourself.

01:41.786 --> 01:43.277
How dare you?

01:43.302 --> 01:45.071
Look at all of the effort

01:45.073 --> 01:47.807
that I put into making
it look like I cooked

01:47.809 --> 01:50.161
when I clearly ordered in from Chase's.

01:54.682 --> 01:56.349
So, but,

01:56.351 --> 01:57.984
you know, what are some of your...

01:58.270 --> 01:59.691
favorite foods?

01:59.716 --> 02:01.153
That's kind of a random

02:01.155 --> 02:03.155
first date sort of
question, don't you think?

02:03.157 --> 02:04.223
Yeah. You're right.

02:04.225 --> 02:05.524
It is.

02:05.526 --> 02:07.426
And this is so clearly not a first date.

02:07.428 --> 02:09.294
This is, like,

02:09.297 --> 02:11.664
the opposite of a first date.

02:16.571 --> 02:18.938
What is that?

02:18.963 --> 02:20.002
What's what?

02:20.027 --> 02:22.002
Every time I reach for you, you...

02:22.027 --> 02:23.845
- you pull away.
- That's not true.

02:23.870 --> 02:28.247
What is tonight supposed
to be... exactly?

02:31.319 --> 02:33.319
I just...

02:33.321 --> 02:36.222
I just thought it'd be good
if we spend some time together.

02:36.224 --> 02:38.724
And this is me...

02:39.916 --> 02:41.527
poorly trying.

02:41.529 --> 02:44.697
And I am also trying

02:44.699 --> 02:46.532
to be patient,

02:46.534 --> 02:48.601
but it's like you came home one day

02:48.603 --> 02:50.770
and you were just a...

02:51.179 --> 02:53.279
you were like a totally
different person.

02:53.304 --> 02:55.226
And...

02:56.711 --> 02:59.405
I just don't want to
have a job interview.

02:59.814 --> 03:02.429
I want to know whether we're engaged.

03:05.569 --> 03:09.088
Absolutely not. This is not
a discussion; it's an order.

03:09.090 --> 03:10.927
No. You...

03:10.952 --> 03:12.880
you are going to the
ballet recital, young lady.

03:12.905 --> 03:14.732
You made a commitment
to be one of the fairies

03:14.757 --> 03:17.076
and you're gonna stick
to that commitment.

03:17.101 --> 03:18.641
Okay, that's my girl.

03:18.666 --> 03:21.710
Yeah. I love you too.

03:25.594 --> 03:26.688
Sorry.

03:26.713 --> 03:28.841
- I didn't realize you were all here.
- Oh, it's okay.

03:28.843 --> 03:30.109
I didn't know that you had a...

03:30.111 --> 03:31.467
Flynn's taken out the Mothership

03:31.492 --> 03:34.281
to May 22, 1934, Arkansas.

03:34.352 --> 03:35.983
Any idea why that date's important?

03:35.985 --> 03:38.995
1934, Arkansas...
that's the Dust Bowl-era.

03:39.020 --> 03:40.820
Great Depression.

03:40.822 --> 03:43.789
Maybe we can get ahead of
these sons of bitches this time.

03:43.791 --> 03:46.225
From that raid on Flynn's
warehouse a few weeks back,

03:46.227 --> 03:49.528
we found this photo of a
necklace and key dated 1934.

03:49.530 --> 03:50.830
- Who's in the picture?
- Not sure.

03:50.832 --> 03:53.615
We had nothing to put
into context until...

03:53.640 --> 03:56.402
This was in the briefcase Rufus
got from Anthony Bruhl in Houston.

03:56.404 --> 03:58.704
May 22, 1934 again.

03:58.706 --> 04:00.239
Mcllroy Bank and Trust.

04:00.241 --> 04:02.438
And the words "Rittenhouse key."

04:02.463 --> 04:03.851
Rittenhouse key.

04:04.132 --> 04:05.578
- What does that mean?
- No idea.

04:05.580 --> 04:07.623
But whatever it is, we think
Flynn went back to get this.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.014
Lucy... Rittenhouse.

04:09.016 --> 04:11.421
That was the name Flynn mentioned
to you at the Hindenburg?

04:11.446 --> 04:12.537
That's right.

04:12.562 --> 04:15.247
- Well, I've been looking into it.
- And what'd you find?

04:15.272 --> 04:17.255
A grand total of nothing.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.884
Has he said anything about it since?

04:21.095 --> 04:22.428
No.

04:22.507 --> 04:25.047
Well, whatever this Rittenhouse key is,

04:25.072 --> 04:26.258
get to this bank.

04:26.283 --> 04:27.867
Get it first. Try to
find out what it opens.

04:27.869 --> 04:29.735
If it's important to
Flynn, it's important to us.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.437
That'll be all.

04:35.411 --> 04:36.987
Mr. Mason.

04:37.012 --> 04:38.932
Yes. Just seeing how...

04:38.934 --> 04:40.487
you've made yourself at home.

04:40.512 --> 04:42.026
Uh, do you have everything you need?

04:42.051 --> 04:43.484
I think so, yes.

04:43.486 --> 04:45.308
Excellent.

04:54.153 --> 04:55.306
What?

04:55.331 --> 04:57.631
Still wearing the engagement
ring of a guy you don't know?

04:57.633 --> 05:00.267
Oh, yeah.... We had a date tonight.

05:00.269 --> 05:02.570
- A date?
- First date for me.

05:02.572 --> 05:04.071
400th for him.

05:04.073 --> 05:06.784
- It was a disaster.
- I bet.

05:08.077 --> 05:09.944
Just cut the poor bastard loose already.

05:09.946 --> 05:11.615
Let him be with someone
he's meant to be with.

05:11.640 --> 05:14.810
What if I'm whoever
he's supposed to be with?

05:15.518 --> 05:17.384
- You can't be serious.
- Think about it.

05:17.386 --> 05:20.688
In this alternate
reality, we were engaged.

05:20.690 --> 05:22.289
I was... in love?

05:22.291 --> 05:24.895
Do you feel that way about
him in the here and now?

05:24.920 --> 05:26.320
No.

05:28.876 --> 05:30.116
Lucy,

05:30.141 --> 05:32.727
- you're supposed to have your sister.
- Believe me, I know that.

05:32.752 --> 05:34.797
Then you should know you're
not supposed to be engaged.

05:34.822 --> 05:36.716
I mean, hell, you shouldn't
have even met this Noah guy.

05:36.741 --> 05:38.472
- I know.
- So you should let him be with

05:38.474 --> 05:40.613
who he is meant to be with.

05:46.309 --> 05:47.948
Come back in one piece, okay?

05:47.950 --> 05:49.550
That's the plan.

05:52.615 --> 05:54.421
While we're young, people.

05:54.423 --> 05:56.649
I need you in the Lifeboat.

05:56.674 --> 05:58.674
Yep. Sure.

06:30.622 --> 06:33.439
We've stolen, what, half a
dozen cars on these trips?

06:33.464 --> 06:34.986
We're like hardened car thieves by now.

06:35.025 --> 06:36.765
Hey, if they don't
want us to borrow 'em,

06:36.790 --> 06:38.390
they shouldn't leave the keys in 'em.

06:38.415 --> 06:39.869
Oh.

06:43.699 --> 06:44.799
Recorder's off.

06:44.801 --> 06:47.235
We should tell Agent Christopher
what we know about Rittenhouse.

06:47.237 --> 06:48.703
Or not at all. No.

06:48.705 --> 06:51.072
She's piecing it together,
Rufus. It's only a matter of time.

06:51.074 --> 06:53.240
Then let her figure it out on her own.

06:53.265 --> 06:54.568
Or we stall her.

06:54.593 --> 06:56.789
Look, I don't know what's
worse... Flynn or Rittenhouse.

06:56.814 --> 06:58.851
But if it's Rittenhouse, we're
gonna need all the help we can get.

06:58.876 --> 07:00.006
Someone we can trust.

07:00.031 --> 07:01.983
- I trust Jiya.
- Yeah, I bet you do.

07:02.187 --> 07:03.820
I got eyes, you sly dog.

07:03.822 --> 07:05.255
Are you and Jiya
happening? Is it happening?

07:05.257 --> 07:06.773
Told you it was gonna happen.

07:06.798 --> 07:09.618
Okay, can we just concentrate
on the mission? Please?

07:09.643 --> 07:11.697
You guys check out the bank. Okay?

07:11.722 --> 07:13.239
I'll keep watch out here.

07:13.264 --> 07:14.858
It happened.

07:15.100 --> 07:16.900
All right, turn the recorder back on.

07:23.709 --> 07:25.442
I'll, um, warn you if I see Flynn.

07:25.444 --> 07:27.410
We'll look for the key.

07:27.576 --> 07:29.379
You ready, Miss Daisy?

07:41.693 --> 07:43.393
- Hello, sir.
- How do, ma'am?

07:43.395 --> 07:45.895
I am thinking about opening an account.

07:45.897 --> 07:48.064
Do you think you could give me
some information on this bank?

07:48.066 --> 07:49.833
- Absolutely.
- Oh, good.

07:49.835 --> 07:51.935
And do you have your husband

07:51.937 --> 07:53.675
or father's permission?

07:53.700 --> 07:55.600
Oh, uh...

08:00.579 --> 08:02.178
I wouldn't if I were you, handsome.

08:02.180 --> 08:04.848
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

08:04.850 --> 08:07.784
This here is a stickup
and we're the Barrow Gang.

08:07.786 --> 08:10.053
I'm Clyde Barrow. This
here is Bonnie Parker.

08:10.055 --> 08:11.488
At your service.

08:11.490 --> 08:13.934
- Bonnie and Clyde?
- What are you lookin' at?

08:14.426 --> 08:15.778
You heard of us?

Don't nobody get bent.

08:30.311 --> 08:32.945
We don't want none of y'all
good people getting hurt.

08:34.914 --> 08:36.581
And as the start of this year,

08:36.582 --> 08:39.484
our good president,
FDR, in all of his, uh,

08:39.509 --> 08:41.203
infinite political wisdom...

08:41.229 --> 08:42.164
Wyatt.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.923
Is insuring your
deposits in his New Deal.

08:44.925 --> 08:47.559
Bonnie's wearing the
key around her neck.

08:52.612 --> 08:54.366
Need a little help?

08:54.368 --> 08:56.034
Yeah, okay.

09:13.359 --> 09:15.287
Run, okay? Go home now.

09:15.289 --> 09:16.822
Go. Go. Go.

09:39.646 --> 09:41.389
How we do, baby?

09:41.538 --> 09:43.195
Well, look at this...

09:46.120 --> 09:47.983
Now, we're just here
for the bank's dough,

09:48.008 --> 09:50.536
so your money and your family's money...

09:50.561 --> 09:52.795
- it's just fine.
- It's just fine.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.629
Y'all have a good day now.

09:58.139 --> 10:00.332
We gotta get that key. Come on.

10:08.957 --> 10:10.663
Guys, look out!

10:19.048 --> 10:21.810
Man, how'd them coppers
get here so fast?

10:23.023 --> 10:24.222
- It's Flynn.
- What?

10:24.224 --> 10:25.441
He's with the cops.

10:36.703 --> 10:39.442
Flynn must be using the cops
to get the key from Bonnie.

10:41.408 --> 10:43.358
- Who the hell's that?
- I don't know,

10:43.383 --> 10:45.566
but they're shooting
in the right direction.

10:47.481 --> 10:49.481
Who are you?

10:49.483 --> 10:50.949
The cops are after us too!

10:50.951 --> 10:52.255
Why are they after you?

10:52.280 --> 10:54.964
Well, we can sit here and chat about
it, or we can get the hell outta here.

10:54.989 --> 10:56.521
Our bucket's all shot up.

10:56.523 --> 10:57.856
We got a car across the street.

10:57.858 --> 11:00.125
Wanna make a run for it?

11:00.127 --> 11:02.513
If you got our backs, we got yours.

11:03.763 --> 11:05.096
- You ready?
- What about Rufus?

11:05.098 --> 11:06.565
- Rufus!
- Rufus knows the drill...

11:06.567 --> 11:08.633
if we get separated, we
meet back at the Lifeboat.

11:08.860 --> 11:11.972
Besides, he's in a lot
better shape than we are.

11:13.925 --> 11:15.474
Let's go!

11:40.362 --> 11:41.861
What the hell?

11:47.198 --> 11:48.764
Looks like we lost 'em.

11:48.789 --> 11:50.334
Let's go back and start, shall we?

11:50.359 --> 11:52.944
This is Bonnie. I'm
Clyde. Who are you two?

11:53.156 --> 11:55.547
I'm Lucy. This here's Wyatt.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.382
What were y'all doing
pulling heat back there?

11:57.384 --> 11:59.551
We were casing that bank
until you and Bonnie showed up

11:59.553 --> 12:01.248
dragging a bunch of cops with you.

12:01.273 --> 12:02.554
Really?

12:02.556 --> 12:04.489
What, just by coincidence
we show up and hit

12:04.491 --> 12:07.413
the exact same bank
at the exact same time?

12:08.179 --> 12:10.041
Well, I guess so.

12:10.252 --> 12:13.815
- Thanks for screwing it up for us.
- We screwed it up for you?

12:14.682 --> 12:17.706
- You never heard of Lucy and Wyatt?
- No.

12:19.432 --> 12:21.072
You heard of the Kansas City Depot job?

12:21.074 --> 12:23.408
Or the Union bank job in
Atchison back in March?

12:23.410 --> 12:25.634
Yeah, I heard of 'em.

12:25.659 --> 12:27.879
The reporters figured us for 'em, but...

12:27.881 --> 12:29.247
we were never there.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.315
Well, we were.

12:30.575 --> 12:33.543
Scored 25,000 smackers.

12:33.615 --> 12:37.184
Got away scot-free 'cause the cops
were going after you instead of us.

12:37.209 --> 12:38.423
I guess we owe you one.

12:38.425 --> 12:41.660
Oh, if that's true, you
owe us more than one.

12:41.662 --> 12:44.273
How 'bout cuttin' us in?

12:45.061 --> 12:49.045
Oh, no. We... we spent that.

12:50.279 --> 12:51.903
On hooch.

12:51.905 --> 12:53.572
Oh.

12:54.167 --> 12:55.662
Yeah.

13:03.508 --> 13:05.913
Park this in the barn here.

13:09.401 --> 13:11.602
Y'all meet us inside when you're done.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.429
I'll show you what real hooch is.

13:17.431 --> 13:18.910
All right.

13:18.935 --> 13:20.165
Okay.

13:24.271 --> 13:25.470
So we just grab that key

13:25.472 --> 13:26.834
around her neck and we run, right?

13:26.859 --> 13:28.073
I think we need to talk to 'em first.

13:28.075 --> 13:30.208
Why? These are two killers.
What are we waitin' for?

13:30.210 --> 13:33.011
Agent Christopher said that we... we
need to figure out what the key is for.

13:33.036 --> 13:34.710
But we don't know where they
got it, who they got it from,

13:34.735 --> 13:35.819
or what the key opens.

13:35.844 --> 13:38.817
If it's this important
to Flynn and Rittenhouse,

13:38.819 --> 13:41.083
shouldn't we find out? Don't you think?

13:41.108 --> 13:42.130
Fine.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.600
But I am not putting on a
stage play for these two.

13:44.625 --> 13:46.558
First sign of trouble, we run.

13:46.583 --> 13:47.915
Okay.

13:50.946 --> 13:54.265
We just have to grab
the key before 9:00 A.M.

13:54.496 --> 13:56.134
What's 9:00 A.M.?

13:56.136 --> 13:59.804
That's when one of Clyde's crew
members, Henry Methvin, sells them out.

13:59.806 --> 14:03.049
He turns them over to this
legendary Ranger, Frank Hamer.

14:03.074 --> 14:06.010
That's the man that was back
there a-at the bank with Flynn.

14:06.035 --> 14:10.615
Hamer and his men pump over 130
bullets into Bonnie and Clyde's car

14:10.617 --> 14:12.254
at 9:00 A.M.

14:13.129 --> 14:14.662
Great.

14:14.687 --> 14:17.169
This just keeps getting
better and better.

14:20.794 --> 14:22.715
Look, I still don't understand
why you brought me in here.

14:22.717 --> 14:24.717
Someone said they saw you
with two of the robbers

14:24.719 --> 14:26.151
right before the shootin' started.

14:26.154 --> 14:28.583
Sir, I would have to be out of my mind

14:28.608 --> 14:30.689
to be in a bank robbing trio
with a couple of white folks.

14:30.691 --> 14:33.459
I mean, that's just
conspicuous, don't you think?

14:33.461 --> 14:35.494
"Conspicuous"?

14:35.496 --> 14:37.429
Fancy word, Professor.

14:37.431 --> 14:38.764
Is it?

14:40.434 --> 14:42.041
Stay right there.

14:44.438 --> 14:46.976
How much worse could this day get?

14:51.766 --> 14:53.903
You had to open your big mouth.

14:53.967 --> 14:55.513
That guy over there...

14:56.404 --> 14:59.018
- Where are you going?
- Uh, you know, sir,

14:59.020 --> 15:01.921
this whole thing has been a
very scary experience for me

15:01.946 --> 15:03.122
and I'd really like to go home.

15:03.124 --> 15:04.268
I told you.

15:04.293 --> 15:05.892
Stay right there.

15:05.917 --> 15:07.049
Hey.

15:09.897 --> 15:11.063
I'm Frank Hamer,

15:11.065 --> 15:12.798
a special investigator.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.299
That bounty hunter,

15:14.301 --> 15:17.002
he said that you and I
need to have a little talk.

15:26.129 --> 15:27.697
Banker's hours?

15:27.699 --> 15:29.131
Hardly.

15:29.133 --> 15:30.700
I can't imagine what would take priority

15:30.702 --> 15:32.214
over our work here.

15:32.239 --> 15:34.870
I have a team analyzing all
the evidence we recovered

15:34.872 --> 15:36.539
from the raid on Flynn's warehouse

15:36.541 --> 15:37.873
and from Anthony Bruhl's briefcase.

15:37.875 --> 15:39.609
All due respect to the government,

15:39.611 --> 15:41.978
but, uh, private sector,
we have analytical tools

15:41.980 --> 15:43.312
that would blow your mind.

15:43.314 --> 15:44.580
Love to take a crack at it.

15:44.582 --> 15:46.227
That's very generous of you, Mr. Mason.

15:46.252 --> 15:47.883
I'd appreciate that.

15:47.885 --> 15:49.151
Well, excellent.

15:49.153 --> 15:52.355
Of course, I'd have to get your
security clearance raised first.

15:52.357 --> 15:53.441
Of course.

15:53.466 --> 15:56.058
There's, uh, often a lot
of red tape, though...

15:56.060 --> 15:58.094
authorizations, sign-offs...

15:58.096 --> 15:59.676
so you'll have to be patient.

16:06.037 --> 16:08.497
Please, don't mind me.

16:13.311 --> 16:14.817
This is he.

16:14.842 --> 16:18.014
That bounty hunter told me
that you were an accomplice

16:18.016 --> 16:20.016
to the two shooters working
with Bonnie and Clyde.

16:20.018 --> 16:21.651
No. That is not true.

16:21.653 --> 16:24.787
He said that their
names are Lucy and Wyatt

16:24.789 --> 16:27.087
and that your name is Rufus Carlin.

16:27.112 --> 16:29.158
He said that you're their driver,

16:29.160 --> 16:31.827
which makes you an
accomplice to armed robbery

16:31.829 --> 16:33.868
and the murder of two
law enforcement officers.

16:33.893 --> 16:35.464
Wait. What'd he say my name was?

16:35.466 --> 16:37.079
Rufus Carlin.

16:37.635 --> 16:38.968
Uh,

16:38.970 --> 16:41.859
what does my driver's
license say my name is?

16:44.008 --> 16:46.408
His name is Wesley Snipes.

16:46.944 --> 16:49.445
- Says so right here.
- It's a forgery.

16:49.447 --> 16:50.614
Forgery?

16:50.639 --> 16:52.958
It's got a stamp on it and
everything. You can't forge that.

16:52.983 --> 16:55.584
He's not Wesley Snipes, trust me.

16:55.787 --> 16:57.730
Come on, just look the other way

16:57.755 --> 16:59.332
and give me three
minutes alone with him.

16:59.357 --> 17:01.190
I'll prove it.

17:01.192 --> 17:02.777
You know,

17:03.428 --> 17:05.961
I was working Nacogdoches one time.

17:05.963 --> 17:08.864
Had a man in custody... a
colored man... accused of murder.

17:08.866 --> 17:10.993
Guilty as sin, by the way.

17:11.234 --> 17:13.836
Outside the courthouse was a mob.

17:13.838 --> 17:16.806
Thousands of 'em screaming
to have him lynched.

17:16.830 --> 17:18.834
But I blocked the courthouse door.

17:18.882 --> 17:21.049
So if I ain't afraid

17:21.074 --> 17:24.381
to stand in front of 2,000
screaming townspeople,

17:24.648 --> 17:28.390
what makes you think I'm afraid to
stand in front of you, bounty hunter?

17:34.633 --> 17:35.891
I...

17:35.893 --> 17:37.927
I was just trying to, uh,

17:37.929 --> 17:40.830
stop Clyde Barrow's Gang
before more good people die.

17:40.832 --> 17:43.265
And for your help, I
promise to get you that key

17:43.267 --> 17:45.535
around Bonnie's neck to
return to your client.

17:45.560 --> 17:49.324
Now, I don't think Wesley
Snipes is who you say he is.

17:49.349 --> 17:51.922
We do have an actual
member of the Barrow Gang

17:51.947 --> 17:53.509
who's willing to help us, though.

17:53.511 --> 17:54.677
So...

17:54.679 --> 17:57.213
you can keep barking up your tree,

17:57.215 --> 18:00.082
or you can help me get Bonnie and Clyde.

18:12.196 --> 18:13.396
A toast...

18:13.398 --> 18:15.842
to close calls.

18:22.783 --> 18:25.430
Stop. Stop it.

18:27.283 --> 18:29.462
- Sit down.
- I'm sitting down.

18:33.451 --> 18:35.851
Oh, you like it, huh?

18:35.853 --> 18:38.650
I've just never seen anything like it.

18:39.384 --> 18:40.733
Where'd you get it?

18:40.758 --> 18:43.858
Clyde got it for me when we got engaged.

18:44.562 --> 18:46.522
You're engaged?

18:47.350 --> 18:49.200
Go on, tell it. You know you want to.

18:49.225 --> 18:50.233
Oh, hell.

18:50.258 --> 18:52.601
Oh, he woke me up in
the middle of the night.

18:52.603 --> 18:55.692
"Bonnie, Bonnie, look,
I got something for you."

18:55.717 --> 18:58.340
And then there he was, down on one knee,

18:58.342 --> 19:00.576
holding this pretty little thing.

19:00.578 --> 19:02.378
And I stopped him right there, I said,

19:02.380 --> 19:04.480
"You know damn well I
can't, you son of a bitch."

19:04.482 --> 19:06.048
Tell 'em why.

19:06.050 --> 19:07.616
'Cause I'm already married.

19:07.618 --> 19:09.552
And that's exactly why

19:09.554 --> 19:11.666
I didn't steal you an engagement ring.

19:11.989 --> 19:13.456
I was trying to be considerate.

19:13.458 --> 19:16.158
Wait. You're already
married to someone else?

19:16.160 --> 19:17.493
Oh, yeah.

19:17.495 --> 19:19.061
She still got Roy's name
tattooed on her thigh.

19:19.063 --> 19:20.830
- Look here, I'll show you.
- Stop it.

19:21.109 --> 19:22.798
How do you think that makes a man feel?

19:22.800 --> 19:25.367
Yeah, but you know I only
have eyes for you, baby.

19:25.392 --> 19:26.969
Oh, yeah.

19:28.806 --> 19:30.039
It's good.

19:30.356 --> 19:33.542
God, I remember when we first met.

19:33.544 --> 19:36.879
This was back when people could
barely afford a sack of rice.

19:36.881 --> 19:38.214
You should have seen him.

19:38.216 --> 19:40.149
Eighteen. Three-piece suit.

19:40.151 --> 19:42.618
Gold money clip filled with dough

19:42.620 --> 19:44.553
and driving a brand-new Fleetwood

19:44.555 --> 19:45.988
he had hot-wired that morning.

19:47.325 --> 19:49.658
Well, I looked at her, I knew

19:49.660 --> 19:51.627
it was meant to be.

19:51.629 --> 19:55.498
He said, "Girl, you about the
prettiest little thing I ever seen."

19:55.500 --> 19:57.399
And then I said...

19:57.401 --> 20:00.275
"My mama don't like me
talking to no strange boys."

20:00.300 --> 20:02.705
And then he said, "Well,
that's too bad, 'cause..."

20:02.707 --> 20:05.417
I'm never gonna leave your side.

20:06.284 --> 20:08.711
And that I'll be his...

20:09.424 --> 20:11.018
forever.

20:12.098 --> 20:14.098
That's even better than I read about.

20:15.887 --> 20:17.486
Like in the papers?

20:17.488 --> 20:18.988
Yeah.

20:18.990 --> 20:20.422
In the papers.

20:20.424 --> 20:22.157
Oh, well, stop the presses!

20:22.159 --> 20:23.926
Here, I'm going on and on.

20:23.928 --> 20:25.361
How'd he do it with you?

20:25.363 --> 20:26.829
Do what?

20:26.831 --> 20:27.897
Propose, silly.

20:27.899 --> 20:31.033
I mean, look at that ring.

20:31.324 --> 20:33.471
I forgot. I'm...

20:33.496 --> 20:35.941
You telling me you don't
remember something like that?

20:37.441 --> 20:39.504
Course I remember.

20:40.578 --> 20:42.111
I...

20:42.113 --> 20:43.612
it was, uh...

20:43.614 --> 20:45.633
I took her up to the top of this hill

20:45.658 --> 20:46.982
in West Texas.

20:46.984 --> 20:48.651
View of the Valley.

20:48.653 --> 20:50.765
Sun getting ready to set.

20:50.790 --> 20:53.289
There's a tree on top...

20:53.291 --> 20:55.205
a great big oak.

20:55.860 --> 20:57.940
I, uh,

20:58.396 --> 21:00.696
kissed her for the first
time under that tree.

21:00.698 --> 21:03.908
Oh, God. That must have been something.

21:04.735 --> 21:06.135
Well, I got down on a knee.

21:06.137 --> 21:08.534
I pulled the ring box out.

21:09.151 --> 21:10.561
Only thing was,

21:10.620 --> 21:13.042
I opened it up upside down.

21:13.044 --> 21:16.471
So the ring falls out
onto the damn grass.

21:17.281 --> 21:19.756
Couldn't find the thing anywhere.

21:20.848 --> 21:23.326
I was so nervous.

21:24.935 --> 21:26.802
Finally, she...

21:27.013 --> 21:29.701
gets down on a knee there with me.

21:30.310 --> 21:32.724
Puts her hand on my cheek.

21:33.959 --> 21:36.107
A-and just says,

21:37.409 --> 21:38.959
"Yes."

21:39.870 --> 21:43.405
And she gives me a kiss
that I will never forget.

21:47.373 --> 21:50.346
And then we look for the
ring together and we find it.

21:53.851 --> 21:56.115
You remember that, honey?

21:56.732 --> 21:57.981
Y-yeah.

22:20.878 --> 22:22.388
Hot damn.

22:22.799 --> 22:24.285
To true love, huh?

22:37.972 --> 22:40.225
What you writing over there, huh?

22:41.109 --> 22:42.142
Oh.

22:42.144 --> 22:44.077
Just one of my poems.

22:44.671 --> 22:46.190
It's about me and Clyde

22:46.215 --> 22:49.182
and everything that we've
been through together.

22:51.486 --> 22:54.688
- You... you like to write?
- I love it.

22:54.690 --> 22:57.490
Just trying to get all my
thoughts down while I still can.

22:57.843 --> 22:59.780
"Still"?

23:00.729 --> 23:02.028
You ever get that feeling

23:02.030 --> 23:04.296
like you know what's gonna happen next?

23:04.882 --> 23:07.179
Oh, yeah. Yeah, a lot lately.

23:07.204 --> 23:10.403
Yeah, we just don't think we
have that much time left is all.

23:10.405 --> 23:12.239
You don't know that.

23:12.241 --> 23:13.573
Oh, it's all right.

23:13.575 --> 23:15.842
You know, as long as
we can go out together.

23:16.359 --> 23:17.892
We can do that.

23:18.009 --> 23:20.631
- That's all that matters.
- Yeah.

23:23.124 --> 23:25.351
Hey, um, Clyde,

23:25.376 --> 23:27.187
where'd you get that necklace?

23:27.189 --> 23:30.323
I'd like to get one
just like it for my...

23:30.325 --> 23:32.459
baby doll... face.

23:32.461 --> 23:34.461
You can't.

23:34.463 --> 23:36.900
- It's unique.
- Unique?

23:36.925 --> 23:38.604
Unique how?

23:39.134 --> 23:40.934
Who I robbed it from.

23:40.936 --> 23:42.269
Well, who?

23:42.271 --> 23:44.337
Henry-damn-Ford himself!

23:44.339 --> 23:45.872
- Oh, come on.
- No.

23:45.874 --> 23:46.956
Yeah.

23:46.981 --> 23:49.276
Clyde decided to write him a letter.

23:49.278 --> 23:51.177
He said, "Dear sir,

23:51.179 --> 23:53.713
"while I still got breath in my lungs,

23:53.715 --> 23:56.883
"I will tell you what
a dandy car you make.

23:56.885 --> 23:59.853
"And I have drove Fords...

23:59.855 --> 24:02.222
- "... exclusively
- ... Exclusively...

24:02.224 --> 24:04.090
"when I could get away with one."

24:04.092 --> 24:06.784
"Even if my business
hasn't been strictly legal,

24:06.809 --> 24:09.763
"don't hurt anything to tell you
what a fine car you got in the V8.

24:09.765 --> 24:12.532
"Signed, Clyde Champion Barrow!"

24:12.534 --> 24:14.495
We found out in the
papers that he framed it

24:14.520 --> 24:15.902
and put it up on his wall.

24:15.904 --> 24:17.637
When we was up in the area on business,

24:17.639 --> 24:20.932
I decided to case the place, you
know. I wanted to see it for myself.

24:21.120 --> 24:23.443
Blew a safe in one of the rooms.

24:23.445 --> 24:25.612
Inside there was this.

24:25.637 --> 24:27.252
Can I see it?

24:30.452 --> 24:33.486
It's solid gold. Heavy.

24:33.488 --> 24:35.755
Wow.

24:35.757 --> 24:37.181
It's really old.

24:37.206 --> 24:39.259
Now, what does that unlock?

24:39.261 --> 24:41.657
Not any lock we've ever picked.

24:41.682 --> 24:44.264
And look, there's all this
funny writing on it, but...

24:44.266 --> 24:47.033
no idea what it means, though.

24:47.035 --> 24:48.668
It's Latin.

24:49.573 --> 24:50.798
- Latin?
- Yeah.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.038
Oh, it's Latin.

24:52.063 --> 24:55.985
Get this... Mr. Ford prints
a letter in my hometown paper

24:56.010 --> 24:59.674
offering $50,000 for the
return of his missing key.

25:00.057 --> 25:01.735
I smelled a trap.

25:01.760 --> 25:03.985
What key's worth that kind of money?

25:04.010 --> 25:05.051
Well...

25:05.053 --> 25:06.345
Wanna help me in the
kitchen, sweetheart?

25:06.370 --> 25:07.626
Mm-hmm.

25:07.651 --> 25:09.252
Yeah, sure thing.

25:10.401 --> 25:12.260
Ah.

25:20.109 --> 25:21.509
Henry Ford?

25:21.534 --> 25:23.214
What, is he part of Rittenhouse?

25:23.239 --> 25:24.751
How far back do these dicks go?

25:24.776 --> 25:27.128
The Latin on the key, it means

25:27.153 --> 25:30.440
"The Key to the Beginning of All Time"
and "The Key to the End of All Time."

25:30.579 --> 25:32.862
Oh, boy, that's not disturbing at all.

25:32.887 --> 25:34.524
What does that even mean?

25:35.650 --> 25:37.717
How much time till
these two get ambushed?

25:38.146 --> 25:39.946
I don't know; 11 hours, I think.

25:39.971 --> 25:42.622
I don't like the way
Clyde is twirling that gun.

25:44.693 --> 25:46.292
They're drunk.

25:46.570 --> 25:47.870
They'll pass out soon enough.

25:47.895 --> 25:49.227
As soon as they fall asleep,

25:49.252 --> 25:50.663
we grab the key, find Rufus,

25:50.665 --> 25:51.931
and get the hell out of here.

25:58.540 --> 26:00.607
You know this man?

26:00.609 --> 26:02.284
Take a walk.

26:05.172 --> 26:07.592
Just answer the damn question.

26:07.617 --> 26:09.350
This man a member of
the Barrow Gang or not?

26:09.375 --> 26:11.008
No, I don't know him.

26:11.180 --> 26:13.787
I told you, Bonnie and Clyde ain't
working with no one else right now.

26:13.812 --> 26:15.299
You know, Henry,

26:15.324 --> 26:16.898
we had a deal.

26:18.976 --> 26:20.984
The Barrow Gang...

26:22.819 --> 26:25.720
for clemency in the Grapevine murders.

26:27.633 --> 26:29.269
Just go get 'em at the cabin.

26:29.799 --> 26:32.273
- The what?
- The cabin!

26:33.437 --> 26:36.305
Near Stortz Plantation. They're
probably hiding there now.

26:38.357 --> 26:39.781
You're free to go.

26:44.619 --> 26:46.186
Thank you.

26:48.524 --> 26:50.517
You're a good man, Mr. Hamer.

26:50.845 --> 26:53.193
Just try to do the right thing.

26:57.032 --> 26:58.498
Um...

26:58.500 --> 27:00.433
is there a back way out?

27:13.124 --> 27:14.490
I'm here.

27:14.492 --> 27:16.158
I'm listening.

27:16.183 --> 27:18.342
Agent Christopher's been
analyzing the evidence

27:18.367 --> 27:21.430
she's collected from Garcia
Flynn and Anthony Bruhl,

27:21.432 --> 27:24.200
and I think it's
refocusing her investigation

27:24.202 --> 27:26.001
toward Rittenhouse.

27:26.003 --> 27:27.670
Well, that's unfortunate.

27:27.672 --> 27:30.756
If I were you, I'd do everything
in my power to dissuade her.

27:30.781 --> 27:33.109
- And if I can't?
- Then we will.

27:33.111 --> 27:34.844
Huh.

27:34.846 --> 27:36.342
You know, I'm tired of these threats

27:36.397 --> 27:38.264
of physical violence towards myself,

27:38.313 --> 27:39.645
Rufus, and now Agent Christopher.

27:39.647 --> 27:41.755
These decisions come from the top.

27:41.780 --> 27:43.216
Above you. Above me.

27:43.218 --> 27:44.436
You don't think anyone will notice

27:44.461 --> 27:47.253
the killing of a senior
Homeland Security field agent?

27:47.255 --> 27:50.036
Oh, our organization has survived

27:50.061 --> 27:52.725
many industrious,

27:52.727 --> 27:55.161
well-intentioned government officials

27:55.163 --> 27:57.780
and journalists over the years.

27:58.623 --> 28:00.299
Trust me.

28:00.301 --> 28:02.467
Agent Christopher

28:02.670 --> 28:04.604
won't be the exception.

28:15.491 --> 28:16.883
We're on the move.

28:16.885 --> 28:18.484
I still need to talk to your prisoner.

28:18.486 --> 28:20.353
I cut him loose.

28:20.850 --> 28:22.114
You did what?

28:22.139 --> 28:23.856
Methvin said he wasn't
a member of the gang.

28:24.040 --> 28:25.239
He'd know.

28:25.264 --> 28:28.397
Now we got a location on Bonnie
and Clyde and those other two.

28:28.428 --> 28:30.162
Methvin's gonna take us right to them.

28:30.164 --> 28:31.931
You in or not?

28:51.689 --> 28:54.089
I thought you said they'd pass out.

28:54.092 --> 28:57.120
Maybe if they ever came up for air.

28:58.697 --> 29:01.565
I mean, can you believe the...

29:01.590 --> 29:03.957
the way they are together?

29:09.941 --> 29:13.108
Yeah, might be robbers
and killers, but...

29:13.478 --> 29:16.245
you can't say they're not in love.

29:16.509 --> 29:18.208
No, I mean just

29:18.343 --> 29:20.893
all the "meant to be's,"

29:21.828 --> 29:23.588
"only ones."

29:25.200 --> 29:27.315
Yeah, what about 'em?

29:27.934 --> 29:30.501
There's a couple billion
people in the world,

29:30.526 --> 29:32.392
and they're the only
ones for each other?

29:32.497 --> 29:34.497
What are the odds?

29:34.499 --> 29:35.632
Oh, what?

29:35.634 --> 29:38.885
You're all about fate and destiny,
except when it comes to love?

29:39.656 --> 29:41.255
I don't know.

29:41.406 --> 29:44.776
I've seen attraction
and chemistry, but...

29:46.845 --> 29:49.143
no lightning bolt from the heavens.

29:49.302 --> 29:51.534
Nothing like that.

29:52.731 --> 29:55.268
I've seen it.

29:55.651 --> 29:58.318
It happened to me.

29:58.476 --> 30:00.910
The engagement story you told...

30:01.515 --> 30:04.094
that was how you proposed to Jessica.

30:13.338 --> 30:15.739
If there's only one person
for you in the whole world,

30:15.741 --> 30:17.497
and you lose them,

30:18.067 --> 30:19.643
does that mean that you have to

30:19.645 --> 30:22.345
live the rest of your
life without anyone else?

30:24.783 --> 30:26.755
I think

30:27.091 --> 30:28.982
you...

30:29.007 --> 30:30.880
we...

30:32.057 --> 30:33.966
anyone...

30:34.817 --> 30:37.384
has to be open to possibilities.

30:48.740 --> 30:50.407
They're asleep.

31:16.802 --> 31:19.208
Are you expecting someone?
I thought I heard a noise.

31:22.021 --> 31:23.273
Who is it?

31:23.275 --> 31:26.042
Clyde, it's me, Henry.

31:34.610 --> 31:36.450
Oh.

31:37.022 --> 31:39.089
We thought you got nabbed.

31:39.091 --> 31:40.657
Yeah, they tried.

31:40.659 --> 31:42.425
Took me three towns to shake 'em.

31:42.427 --> 31:44.044
Yeah, go get dressed.

31:44.069 --> 31:46.273
- Who's this?
- This is Lucy and Wyatt.

31:46.298 --> 31:49.299
Lucy and Wyatt, this is one of
our best friends, Henry Methvin.

31:49.301 --> 31:51.434
They helped us out with
the bank job yesterday.

31:51.973 --> 31:53.703
Did they now?

31:53.705 --> 31:56.439
Guess we were just in the
right place at the right time.

31:57.091 --> 31:58.641
And where did you say you were from?

31:58.643 --> 32:01.578
- She didn't.
- I didn't ask you.

32:01.580 --> 32:04.381
Why don't y'all cool off while
Bonnie and I talk to Henry?

32:04.383 --> 32:07.050
Come on, you ugly son of a bitch.

32:13.873 --> 32:15.076
Is he the one that you...

32:15.101 --> 32:17.160
Yes. That gives up Bonnie and Clyde.

32:17.162 --> 32:18.795
He's a psychopath.

32:18.797 --> 32:21.631
He's the one that took them on the
killing spree across the Midwest.

32:21.633 --> 32:23.600
And then Methvin cuts a deal with Hamer

32:23.602 --> 32:25.135
to lure Bonnie and Clyde into the trap

32:25.137 --> 32:26.936
which is nowhere near here.

32:26.938 --> 32:28.571
So what is he doing here now?

32:28.573 --> 32:30.173
Something is very wrong.

32:30.175 --> 32:32.951
We need to get that key and go.

32:41.480 --> 32:43.080
Oh, my God.

32:43.105 --> 32:44.965
Oh, my God. Thank God that you're okay.

32:44.990 --> 32:46.956
- How did you get here?
- You mean after you ditched me?

32:46.958 --> 32:48.391
Come on! We didn't have a choice.

32:48.393 --> 32:49.726
- You guys get the key?
- Yes.

32:49.751 --> 32:51.884
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- But it's still around Bonnie's neck.

32:51.909 --> 32:53.453
Oh, jeez. Look, we don't have much time.

32:53.478 --> 32:55.231
Flynn is on his way
here with a bunch of cops

32:55.233 --> 32:56.345
and they are packing serious heat.

32:56.370 --> 32:57.806
The ambush changed.
It's happening early?

32:57.831 --> 32:59.397
Well, well...

32:59.604 --> 33:01.986
I thought the party was inside.

33:03.165 --> 33:04.853
- Sit down!
- Bonnie...

33:04.878 --> 33:06.076
I told you we couldn't trust...

33:06.078 --> 33:08.712
- He is a friend of ours.
- I know you.

33:08.714 --> 33:11.001
- I seen him talking to the cops, Clyde.
- Me?

33:11.026 --> 33:13.215
The cops are on their way
to this cabin right now

33:13.218 --> 33:15.218
because your friend... Henry, is it?

33:15.220 --> 33:17.253
- Sold you out!
- That's a lie, Clyde.

33:17.255 --> 33:19.089
- Let's just kill 'em right now.
- Take it easy, Clyde.

33:19.091 --> 33:20.619
Shut up.

33:21.026 --> 33:23.159
I always knew there was
something funny about you.

33:23.161 --> 33:24.294
Kill him, Clyde.

33:24.296 --> 33:26.029
Get it over with.

33:29.067 --> 33:32.001
You know, Henry, we had a deal.

33:32.003 --> 33:33.770
The Barrow Gang...

33:34.072 --> 33:36.539
- What the hell is that thing?
- It's a voice recorder.

33:36.541 --> 33:37.874
Like they use in the talkies.

33:37.876 --> 33:39.798
Just go get 'em at the cabin.

33:39.823 --> 33:41.544
It sounds exactly like you, Henry.

33:41.546 --> 33:42.912
- The cabin.
- Make it stop.

33:42.914 --> 33:45.204
Near Stortz Plantation. They're
probably hiding there now.

34:05.337 --> 34:08.525
Bonnie, Clyde, I'm real sorry.

34:10.442 --> 34:12.074
Don't move.

34:12.077 --> 34:14.454
- What the hell is this?
- Rufus.

34:14.772 --> 34:16.539
Henry was right.

34:16.815 --> 34:17.880
You're liars.

34:17.882 --> 34:19.114
That's not true, Bonnie.

34:19.117 --> 34:21.317
- We just came for the necklace.
- That's all we need.

34:21.319 --> 34:22.752
You can go back to your lives.

34:22.754 --> 34:25.054
I ain't just gonna give it to you.

34:25.056 --> 34:26.556
You have to kill us both...

34:30.495 --> 34:32.033
The necklace!

34:46.724 --> 34:48.185
Clyde.

34:49.154 --> 34:51.291
Baby, no!

34:51.315 --> 34:52.715
No! Let me go!

34:52.717 --> 34:54.384
No!

34:54.386 --> 34:56.880
No! Let me go!

34:57.121 --> 34:58.555
This isn't...

34:58.557 --> 35:00.456
this isn't how it's supposed to be!

35:00.458 --> 35:02.458
You can do whatever the hell you want.

35:03.995 --> 35:06.084
Flynn's got the key!

35:07.891 --> 35:09.043
Clyde.

35:09.068 --> 35:10.800
No!

35:10.802 --> 35:12.553
Baby?

35:14.206 --> 35:17.807
You promised never
to leave me, remember?

35:20.412 --> 35:23.179
That we would be together...

35:23.181 --> 35:25.281
forever.

35:29.575 --> 35:32.592
Someday they'll go down together...

35:33.498 --> 35:34.724
Ms. Parker?

35:34.726 --> 35:36.859
They'll bury them side-by-side...

35:36.861 --> 35:38.936
Don't do anything stupid.

35:39.514 --> 35:40.964
Careful.

35:42.170 --> 35:44.367
Ah!

35:44.369 --> 35:46.803
To few it'll be grief,

35:46.805 --> 35:49.138
to the law a relief,

35:49.194 --> 35:52.482
but it's death for Bonnie and Clyde.

35:53.999 --> 35:55.799
So Flynn wasn't there to change history?

35:55.800 --> 35:57.186
No. Not this time.

35:57.211 --> 35:58.973
And you never figured
out what the key was for?

35:58.998 --> 36:01.622
Or how it related to
whatever Rittenhouse is?

36:01.647 --> 36:02.981
No.

36:03.006 --> 36:06.176
How Flynn even knew about
the key to begin with?

36:06.201 --> 36:07.747
I'm sorry, ma'am.

36:07.772 --> 36:09.629
We were just outgunned.

36:09.740 --> 36:12.382
Honestly, lucky to get out in one piece.

36:13.281 --> 36:15.981
Well, Flynn has the key now.

36:16.514 --> 36:18.495
Perhaps one of your crack analysts

36:18.520 --> 36:20.461
can figure out what to do next.

36:20.486 --> 36:23.162
If not, my offer to help still stands.

36:29.706 --> 36:31.640
- Hey.
- Oh. Hey.

36:36.922 --> 36:39.852
Hey, about that kiss back there...

36:40.087 --> 36:43.388
uh, you know, it was in the moment
and Clyde seemed like he was...

36:43.727 --> 36:46.366
- so I had to make it look real.
- No, of course. It was smart.

36:46.391 --> 36:47.937
I mean, we had to get the
story on the key and pretend...

36:47.962 --> 36:50.759
- It was just playing a role.
- I know. It worked.

36:53.033 --> 36:56.048
Anyway, sorry if that
took you by surprise.

36:56.376 --> 36:57.736
I'll live.

37:04.878 --> 37:06.945
Thanks.

37:06.947 --> 37:09.481
All right, well, I will...

37:09.483 --> 37:11.750
see you later...

37:11.752 --> 37:13.118
baby doll.

37:13.503 --> 37:14.869
See ya around...

37:14.894 --> 37:16.244
sweetheart.

37:30.570 --> 37:32.270
Join you?

37:32.272 --> 37:34.105
Um...

37:34.566 --> 37:36.308
s-sure. How'd you know I was...

37:36.310 --> 37:39.144
You forget what I do for a living.

37:39.146 --> 37:42.088
You've worked with Connor
Mason how many years now?

37:42.113 --> 37:44.697
Um, nine. Nine years.

37:44.722 --> 37:46.753
Is he in any trouble?

37:47.154 --> 37:49.854
No. I don't think so.

37:49.856 --> 37:53.224
Rufus, are you aware
that he went bankrupt,

37:53.226 --> 37:56.928
nearly lost everything, and
then about five years ago,

37:56.930 --> 38:00.865
he was funded to the
tune of $2.5 billion?

38:01.279 --> 38:04.902
Did someone else finance his
little time travel project?

38:06.073 --> 38:08.051
Where did the money come from?

38:10.067 --> 38:12.077
I...

38:12.079 --> 38:14.737
you know, I really don't
get involved in, uh,

38:14.762 --> 38:16.414
Connor's finances or
anything of that nature...

38:16.416 --> 38:18.668
Have you ever seen this man?

38:19.168 --> 38:21.052
Was it his money?

38:21.785 --> 38:22.979
Look, Rufus,

38:23.004 --> 38:24.911
before I worked for the NCTC,

38:24.936 --> 38:27.513
I won't say how long
ago, I was just a cop.

38:27.538 --> 38:29.300
And I still am.

38:29.325 --> 38:32.010
What do I know about
closed-timeline-curves

38:32.035 --> 38:33.831
and butterfly effect crap?

38:33.856 --> 38:35.405
But I do know people

38:35.430 --> 38:37.343
and I know you're a good guy,

38:37.368 --> 38:40.402
just as much as I know Connor
Mason is hiding something.

38:43.909 --> 38:46.576
- Agent Christopher, I ca...
- Please trust me.

38:46.601 --> 38:49.436
I am just trying to do
the right thing here.

38:52.209 --> 38:55.387
A man named Hamer said the
exact same thing to me today.

38:55.389 --> 38:56.921
Oh, yeah?

38:56.923 --> 38:58.857
Sounded just like you.
You would have liked him.

38:58.859 --> 39:00.795
- This man he's meeting with...
- Stop.

39:05.420 --> 39:07.873
If there is anyone in this world

39:08.131 --> 39:09.667
that you love,

39:09.669 --> 39:12.237
you will stop looking into this

39:12.614 --> 39:14.113
right now.

39:14.513 --> 39:19.021
- Are you threatening me?
- I am the last person to threaten you.

39:19.671 --> 39:22.060
I'm warning you.

39:22.582 --> 39:24.427
Please.

39:25.809 --> 39:27.642
I don't want to see you

39:27.667 --> 39:30.857
or anyone you love get hurt.

39:32.138 --> 39:34.924
I didn't take this job
because I'm afraid, Rufus.

39:35.098 --> 39:37.665
You let me worry about
the people I love.

39:40.951 --> 39:42.818
Okay.

39:43.826 --> 39:46.334
But I'm trusting you.

39:47.602 --> 39:49.168
I'll tell you everything I know.

39:49.193 --> 39:51.638
- About Connor?
- About Rittenhouse.
