00:07.508 --> 00:09.499
My name is Temple Grandin.

00:10.077 --> 00:12.136
I'm not like other people.

00:16.450 --> 00:19.146
I think in pictures and I connect them.

02:07.927 --> 02:09.918
- There she is!
- Temple!

02:12.131 --> 02:13.530
It's hot!

02:15.034 --> 02:18.526
Come on, dear.
You're holding up the other passengers!

02:19.839 --> 02:21.830
I can see the heat!

02:27.880 --> 02:30.110
- Temple!
- Sandy, over here.

02:33.653 --> 02:35.518
Do people live here?

02:42.728 --> 02:44.696
The wolf is growling

02:44.764 --> 02:48.165
and the man with the shotgun
says to Illya Kuryakin,

02:48.234 --> 02:50.964
"Would you like for me to open the gate?"

02:52.171 --> 02:54.401
I'm sorry, Temple, you lost me.

02:54.474 --> 02:57.773
<i>The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</i>
<i>The Gazebo in the Maze.</i>

02:57.844 --> 02:59.175
<i>The wolf is growling</i>

02:59.245 --> 03:01.907
and the man with the shotgun
says to Illya Kuryakin,

03:01.981 --> 03:04.541
"Would you like for me to open the gate?"

03:05.184 --> 03:08.051
"Would you like for me to open the gate?"

03:12.425 --> 03:13.687
You okay?

03:14.961 --> 03:18.522
- Aunt Ann, what is this place?
- Just holding pens.

03:18.598 --> 03:21.328
You don't have those
on the East Coast, huh?

03:21.400 --> 03:23.800
Is this where they slaughter them?

03:24.804 --> 03:26.271
Yes, it is.

03:32.612 --> 03:35.342
"Would you like for me to open the gate?"

03:35.848 --> 03:38.578
"Would you like for me to open the gate?"

03:38.751 --> 03:40.378
Yes. Yes, please.

03:41.654 --> 03:43.849
Open the gate, please, Temple.

03:45.458 --> 03:48.518
- Would you like for me to open that gate?
- Yes!

04:17.923 --> 04:19.255
That's it!

04:28.834 --> 04:30.461
Come on, Temple.

04:48.154 --> 04:49.348
Temple?

04:50.923 --> 04:52.390
Come on, git!

04:53.459 --> 04:55.017
There they are.

04:55.094 --> 04:56.925
Temple made it okay.

04:57.563 --> 05:00.259
- Say hi to your Uncle Mike.
- Hi, Temple.

05:00.900 --> 05:03.698
I just been telling Billy here
all about our summer visitor.

05:06.172 --> 05:09.198
- Are you a cowboy?
- Excuse my niece.

05:09.275 --> 05:12.642
That's not how we greet people, Temple.
You know better than that.

05:13.879 --> 05:15.813
Hello, I'm Temple. It's very nice to meet you.

05:15.881 --> 05:18.748
Hello, I'm Temple. It's very nice to meet you.

05:18.818 --> 05:20.217
Nice to meet you, too.

05:23.489 --> 05:24.649
Ma'am.

05:25.725 --> 05:27.750
Thanks for this. I'll replace it tomorrow.

05:27.827 --> 05:30.022
Yeah. No rush. I got spares.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.467
Do you get <i>The Man from U.N.C.L.E.?</i>

05:36.335 --> 05:37.666
Let me show you your room.

05:46.946 --> 05:48.573
These okay here?

05:51.050 --> 05:52.950
And I put all my science fiction books there.

05:53.019 --> 05:57.649
- How do I know this is my room?
- Because we say so. It's your room.

06:14.840 --> 06:15.829
Okay?

06:19.011 --> 06:20.103
Okay.

06:35.227 --> 06:39.789
So, Temple, you excited about college?
That's something.

06:40.700 --> 06:42.725
- Thank you.
- I can't eat that.

06:42.802 --> 06:44.429
I have colitis. I get it from nervousness.

06:44.503 --> 06:46.903
- I eat pudding and Jell-O.
- I know.

06:46.972 --> 06:48.132
Your mom said.

06:52.878 --> 06:56.644
So you didn't answer Mike's question.
Are you excited about going to college?

06:56.716 --> 07:00.015
I want to stay in high school.
I like my science teacher.

07:00.353 --> 07:02.651
Dr. Carlock's very smart
and he's been to college.

07:02.722 --> 07:07.455
So I don't understand why I have to move
to learn what he probably already knows.

07:14.066 --> 07:16.159
The dessert spoons and teaspoons
go in different sections.

07:16.235 --> 07:17.668
I did that.

07:20.706 --> 07:25.143
You know, your uncle can't tell them apart.
And sometimes I can't either.

07:27.380 --> 07:29.041
They're different.

07:30.249 --> 07:31.739
Yes, they are.

07:32.918 --> 07:36.615
I think it's time for bed, young lady.
We get up with the rooster around here.

07:50.002 --> 07:53.130
- You got everything?
- This is my room.

07:55.541 --> 07:56.906
Yes, it is.

07:57.843 --> 07:59.572
- So, good night.
- I don't want you to do that.

07:59.645 --> 08:01.875
I'm sorry. I forgot. No hugs.

08:04.683 --> 08:05.877
Good night then.

08:52.096 --> 08:53.996
- Hello?
- <i>Did I wake you?</i>

08:54.499 --> 08:55.693
- Of course not.
- Who is it?

08:55.767 --> 08:57.098
It's Ann!

08:58.503 --> 09:01.802
Guess what I found balled up
in the bottom of Temple's closet?

09:01.873 --> 09:04.535
A lovely summer frock she didn't want?

09:04.876 --> 09:08.334
It's taken me an age to iron it.
I'll mail it in the morning.

09:08.413 --> 09:11.246
If you couldn't get her to pack it,
I'm not sure I can get her to wear it.

09:11.316 --> 09:13.750
The other one came off
the minute she arrived.

09:13.818 --> 09:15.149
How is she?

09:16.588 --> 09:19.318
- She's good.
- Tell me.

09:20.725 --> 09:25.890
She... She got tense
when Mike mentioned college, but...

09:25.964 --> 09:29.866
No, but then she calmed down
and she went off to bed just fine.

09:29.934 --> 09:33.028
Stop worrying.
Temple's my job for the summer.

09:33.104 --> 09:35.038
Worry about the others.

09:35.106 --> 09:37.472
I'm sure she's gonna have a great time.

09:37.542 --> 09:41.672
You do remember, though,
something's gonna set her off.

09:50.121 --> 09:51.315
Temple?

09:53.024 --> 09:54.218
Temple!

09:57.495 --> 10:01.295
Temple, I could really use a hand here!

10:08.740 --> 10:11.334
So any idea what your major might be?

10:11.409 --> 10:13.604
Science, probably psychology.

10:16.180 --> 10:18.444
You don't have to decide just yet, do you?

10:18.516 --> 10:21.314
- It's better than boarding school.
- That's great.

10:21.386 --> 10:23.786
- Lots of choices...
- Danny's looking at you.

10:23.855 --> 10:26.847
See? He can see all around
without moving his head.

10:27.792 --> 10:30.260
- So how do you know where he's looking?
- His ears.

10:30.328 --> 10:32.558
He points his ears where he's looking.

10:32.630 --> 10:37.294
See? He's looking at you.
And he's looking at those cowboys.

10:38.836 --> 10:42.169
See? Now I've got his attention.
Now he's looking at me.

10:42.240 --> 10:45.107
You're right. How'd you figure that out?

10:48.479 --> 10:50.743
- There you go!
- What are they doing?

11:05.163 --> 11:07.222
What is this thing?

11:07.732 --> 11:10.826
It holds her still so Billy can inoculate her.

11:34.425 --> 11:36.893
What happened to it? It calmed down.

11:37.862 --> 11:39.989
They just like it. It gentles them.

12:37.321 --> 12:39.812
Stand still and they'll come to you.

12:40.158 --> 12:42.285
Won't harm you. Just curious.

12:43.094 --> 12:44.959
Can't help themselves.

13:25.403 --> 13:27.701
Are you worried
about keeping up with the other students?

13:27.772 --> 13:31.503
- No. I'm not stupid.
- I didn't say you were.

13:31.576 --> 13:34.773
- Is it moving away from home?
- Hold it straighter.

13:37.181 --> 13:39.706
Why don't you want to go to college?

13:41.052 --> 13:42.246
People.

13:42.920 --> 13:44.911
I don't understand people.

13:44.989 --> 13:46.957
At least the people at school know
I don't understand them

13:47.024 --> 13:50.221
- and some of them are my friends anyway.
- What don't you understand?

13:51.295 --> 13:53.354
Girls get all goofy over boys.

13:55.299 --> 13:58.234
They talk about silly pop groups
and clothes and say things like,

13:58.302 --> 14:00.293
"Why are you so grumpy?" when I'm happy.

14:00.371 --> 14:03.272
And I say, "I'm happy."
And they say, "Well, you don't look happy."

14:03.341 --> 14:07.072
And I say, "Can't you see I'm thinking?
And can't you see I'm sad?"

14:08.045 --> 14:10.673
And I don't know what they're talking about.

14:11.783 --> 14:13.910
What do you look like when you're happy?

14:14.352 --> 14:15.512
Like this.

14:16.454 --> 14:18.046
No. That's not what you looked like

14:18.122 --> 14:19.987
when you were telling me about
<i>The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</i>

14:20.057 --> 14:21.854
You looked like this.

14:25.862 --> 14:27.830
That's funny looking.

14:29.332 --> 14:31.732
Happy. And that's you angry.

14:42.012 --> 14:44.071
Happy. I'm happy in that one.

14:45.515 --> 14:47.574
I'd say more satisfied.

14:49.319 --> 14:50.650
Satisfied.

15:18.014 --> 15:20.346
Maria, can you give me a hand here?

16:13.570 --> 16:16.164
Temple! Temple!

16:33.156 --> 16:34.680
Close it on me.

16:35.191 --> 16:37.386
- Temple, let's get you out of...
- Close it on me!

16:37.460 --> 16:40.952
- Don't be silly!
- Please!

16:51.841 --> 16:54.275
Close the sides. Close the sides.

16:55.345 --> 16:56.937
Please!

17:02.986 --> 17:04.613
Harder! More!

18:16.693 --> 18:18.718
Did you see Temple's handiwork
at the gate?

18:18.795 --> 18:21.059
Isn't that the darndest thing?

18:22.999 --> 18:24.023
Hi.

18:25.769 --> 18:27.293
- Hi, darling.
- Hi.

18:27.370 --> 18:30.999
All these years Ann's been bugging me,
like I could ever come up with that!

18:37.547 --> 18:38.980
Is that it?

18:40.083 --> 18:42.074
Is that what Temple's been using?

18:42.152 --> 18:47.215
Yes, it is.
I know, it looks horrible, but it helps her.

18:52.929 --> 18:55.762
I'll go find Temple. Temple!

19:01.004 --> 19:03.029
That's mine. That's Temple's.

19:03.106 --> 19:06.405
She's had a great summer.
You won't believe the things she's fixed.

19:06.476 --> 19:09.843
- She's wonderful with the cattle.
- Yeah. I... I appreciate that.

19:09.913 --> 19:12.973
I should warn you,
she has her mind set on staying.

19:13.049 --> 19:14.607
That's not an option.

19:18.188 --> 19:19.314
Ann.

19:21.558 --> 19:25.085
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to attack you,

19:25.161 --> 19:27.561
especially when you've been
so generous all summer.

19:27.630 --> 19:29.791
Temple? Temple?

19:32.869 --> 19:34.063
Temple.

19:35.205 --> 19:36.467
Temple!

19:54.791 --> 19:57.783
How was your trip, Mother?
You made good time.

19:58.761 --> 20:02.094
It was long. Thank you for asking.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.797
You ready for college?

20:08.938 --> 20:11.202
I think I'd rather stay here.

20:12.375 --> 20:14.275
We've talked about this.

20:14.644 --> 20:17.112
Sweetheart, you're gonna be fine.

20:18.848 --> 20:22.375
No one expected it.
It's nothing short of a miracle.

20:25.255 --> 20:26.779
It's a miracle!

20:42.704 --> 20:44.899
Temple, this way.

20:56.518 --> 20:59.009
- Can I get that for you?
- Thank you.

21:23.078 --> 21:25.546
224. This is you.

21:34.756 --> 21:36.815
- I don't have a roommate.
- No, no, no.

21:36.892 --> 21:40.293
Your roommate is coming
in another couple of weeks.

21:40.362 --> 21:41.624
Remember?

21:42.698 --> 21:44.723
Everyone else has a roommate!

21:44.800 --> 21:49.567
Well, then, why don't you just think of it
as a chance to settle in, sweetheart?

21:50.272 --> 21:52.365
- Think I'll go back home!
- Temple.

21:52.441 --> 21:55.842
I know that this is strange and new,

21:55.911 --> 21:58.846
- but you're going to be all right.
- I don't want to stay here!

21:58.914 --> 22:00.905
Try and stay calm.

22:01.250 --> 22:04.845
It's all right. Try and calm down, all right?

22:04.920 --> 22:07.718
I'm going to give you a moment to yourself.

22:20.636 --> 22:22.467
- What's wrong?
- Is she all right?

22:22.537 --> 22:25.131
Interested in playing with other children?

22:25.741 --> 22:27.299
No, not really.

22:27.909 --> 22:29.809
Plays with toys, dolls?

22:30.012 --> 22:32.139
She loves to rip things.

22:32.681 --> 22:35.081
And no speech yet at the age of...

22:35.250 --> 22:37.684
Four. She's four.

22:39.354 --> 22:41.049
No, not yet.

22:44.526 --> 22:49.623
- I'm sure it's just a phase, but...
- Your child is clearly autistic.

22:51.633 --> 22:55.797
- Autistic. I'm... I'm not familiar...
- She's an infantile schizophrenic.

22:58.807 --> 23:01.674
Infantile... So...

23:02.544 --> 23:07.174
So when would she grow out of it?
I mean, what's the next step for...

23:07.249 --> 23:10.082
We generally recommend an institution.

23:10.152 --> 23:13.747
For how long?
I'm not sure I would like that. I really...

23:13.822 --> 23:15.983
I... I wouldn't want to miss her first words.

23:16.058 --> 23:18.322
She probably will never speak.

23:19.328 --> 23:22.195
And I'm afraid
there is no course of treatment.

23:22.264 --> 23:25.131
I'm talking about institutionalization.

23:28.270 --> 23:29.464
But...

23:32.140 --> 23:36.338
I mean, she... She was a perfectly normal
baby and then later she changed.

23:36.411 --> 23:39.608
So I need to know how, why.

23:40.916 --> 23:44.317
I'm not sure you'd...
Perhaps if you had your husband call me.

23:44.386 --> 23:47.287
My husband is a very busy man
and I graduated from Harvard,

23:47.356 --> 23:50.951
- so why don't you try me?
- I'm sorry.

23:53.562 --> 23:58.124
It's been suggested that it may be
a lack of bonding with the mother,

23:58.767 --> 24:03.431
that at a crucial phase,
the mother was cold, aloof,

24:03.505 --> 24:05.973
when the child most needed
physical affection.

24:06.208 --> 24:07.732
But that is not what happened.

24:07.809 --> 24:10.039
We have another child
and she is not like this,

24:10.112 --> 24:12.740
and I did not do anything different.

24:12.814 --> 24:16.944
Temple rejects me. I...
I want to hug her and she won't let me.

24:17.786 --> 24:20.220
I'm supposed to have done this.
Well, then, I can undo it.

24:20.288 --> 24:22.813
- You just tell me what to do.
- As I said,

24:22.891 --> 24:28.591
I recommend institutionalization.
Here's a list of facilities that we recommend.

24:29.464 --> 24:31.364
Dog.

24:32.100 --> 24:34.193
Dog.

24:34.269 --> 24:36.533
Temple. Dog.

24:42.144 --> 24:45.477
Temple. Cat.

24:46.148 --> 24:48.810
Cat. Temple, try.

24:51.753 --> 24:54.881
Mommy.

24:56.658 --> 24:57.750
Mommy.

25:00.395 --> 25:02.022
I know you can hear me.

25:06.201 --> 25:10.763
All right.
I think Mommy needs a five-minute break.

25:35.630 --> 25:36.722
Okay?

25:38.967 --> 25:40.059
Okay.

25:55.317 --> 25:58.980
No. I don't want to study French.
I want to learn science.

26:03.124 --> 26:04.716
Read the page, please.

26:07.963 --> 26:09.260
Read it.

26:16.104 --> 26:18.038
And what did it say?

26:30.252 --> 26:31.412
You...

26:32.254 --> 26:33.778
You learned it?

26:34.689 --> 26:36.452
I just looked at it.

26:36.725 --> 26:39.694
Then I have the page in my mind
and can read off the page.

26:39.761 --> 26:42.161
I see pictures and connect them.

27:04.251 --> 27:05.843
Hey, save me a seat!

27:06.053 --> 27:08.351
Let me see. Come out here.

27:09.356 --> 27:11.415
- John, I got one for you.
- Coming through.

27:11.725 --> 27:12.783
Watch out!

27:18.032 --> 27:20.592
I only eat Jell-O and yogurt!

27:20.668 --> 27:23.136
I only... I only eat Jell-O and yogurt!

27:39.820 --> 27:41.082
You see her?

28:43.550 --> 28:44.881
Excuse me?

28:46.320 --> 28:47.981
I'm your roommate.

28:48.489 --> 28:50.218
What are you doing?

28:50.524 --> 28:52.116
It's a machine I just made.

28:52.192 --> 28:55.992
It feels like a hug. Do you want a hug?
It feels really good.

29:03.404 --> 29:07.431
So when you got in your machine,
did it make you feel like a cow?

29:10.444 --> 29:12.309
No, I didn't feel like a cow.

29:13.147 --> 29:15.138
But it gave you pleasure.

29:15.382 --> 29:17.612
It made me feel good, gentle.

29:18.886 --> 29:21.286
- The hug made you feel good.
- Yes.

29:22.056 --> 29:25.219
- But you don't like to be touched by people.
- No.

29:28.128 --> 29:30.426
Do you like to touch yourself?

29:33.467 --> 29:35.367
Touching myself's okay.

29:35.869 --> 29:37.837
But when the squeeze machine
touches you,

29:37.905 --> 29:39.497
- it feels better?
- Yes.

29:40.974 --> 29:42.339
It gives you release?

29:45.979 --> 29:47.947
Yes, there is release.

29:53.654 --> 29:55.713
- But I need it!
- Let's take it down.

29:55.789 --> 29:58.815
- I built it! It's mine!
- What's all the noise?

29:58.926 --> 30:01.417
- Wait! Stop it!
- Pervert.

30:02.162 --> 30:04.062
- Got it? Okay.
- Yeah, I got it.

30:25.319 --> 30:29.153
Twenty three hours, 59 minutes

30:29.223 --> 30:34.684
and four, three, two, one.
Zero hour, Mr. Solo!

30:59.086 --> 31:01.247
Hey! What are you doing?

31:03.023 --> 31:06.288
Stop! I said stop!

31:39.159 --> 31:41.684
She says she's not going back
after spring break

31:41.762 --> 31:43.525
unless she can take it with her.

31:46.366 --> 31:48.630
- Are you still there?
- Yes.

31:48.702 --> 31:51.364
And I really don't think it's a good idea.

31:51.438 --> 31:53.167
It works for her.

31:53.240 --> 31:55.970
It's everything
we've been struggling to get away from.

31:56.043 --> 31:59.501
They were perfectly clear.
No devices in her room.

31:59.913 --> 32:03.440
Could there be a better way to mark her
as a weirdo and an oddball?

32:04.751 --> 32:06.719
Just let us try, okay?

32:10.057 --> 32:11.251
So that's it.

32:14.895 --> 32:16.260
Okay!

32:35.582 --> 32:36.674
<i>It makes me gentle.</i>

32:36.750 --> 32:38.809
<i>She's a different person</i>
<i>after just</i> 15 <i>minutes.</i>

32:38.886 --> 32:41.514
A different person?
How can you explain that?

32:41.588 --> 32:45.285
I can't explain why the machine works,
but I know it's not sexual.

32:45.726 --> 32:46.886
As Temple says, it calms her.

32:46.960 --> 32:48.587
Look, all this does is to convince me

32:48.662 --> 32:50.823
that we're not equipped
to deal with Ms. Grandin's needs.

32:50.898 --> 32:52.525
It makes her a better student.

32:52.599 --> 32:54.624
She's able to concentrate,
to interact with others more easily...

32:54.701 --> 32:56.464
This isn't very scientific.

32:56.536 --> 32:59.334
- There is no empirical evidence...
- I can do an experiment.

32:59.406 --> 33:01.067
I can...
I can see how it works on other people.

33:01.141 --> 33:04.804
I can measure heart rates.
I think it'll work on everyone.

33:07.547 --> 33:09.412
Let's talk frankly.

33:09.850 --> 33:12.579
I'm not sure you can get anything
from being at Franklin Pierce.

33:12.652 --> 33:15.917
Listen to what she's saying. She wants to
do her own science experiment,

33:15.988 --> 33:18.183
something you can evaluate
in her psychology course.

33:18.257 --> 33:20.555
I have a pen and a clipboard.

33:29.335 --> 33:30.427
Time.

33:32.138 --> 33:34.265
Do you feel, A, claustrophobic,

33:34.874 --> 33:36.671
B, constricted,

33:36.943 --> 33:38.808
C, no different,

33:39.211 --> 33:41.042
D, comfortable,

33:41.213 --> 33:42.908
E, relaxed?

33:43.716 --> 33:46.947
- What was the one before last?
- D, comfortable.

33:47.653 --> 33:50.349
- Yes, I'm quite comfortable.
- Okay.

33:53.659 --> 33:55.524
C, no different.

33:57.063 --> 33:59.361
A, claustrophobic!

33:59.799 --> 34:02.393
I guess I feel relaxed.

34:06.038 --> 34:07.630
Very relaxed.

34:41.172 --> 34:42.572
Oh, my God.

34:44.342 --> 34:46.277
"F" for "Freak."

34:46.344 --> 34:49.871
Hello? Hampshire Country School?
I need to speak to Dr. Carlock!

34:49.949 --> 34:52.815
<i>Dr. Carlock? Yes. Please hold.</i>

35:01.193 --> 35:03.457
- You're doing great.
- I'm going.

35:08.100 --> 35:10.227
Here, piggy, piggy, piggy.

35:19.945 --> 35:21.537
- You're such a good boy.
- Please, here, take this.

35:21.614 --> 35:23.673
I'll take these. Welcome.

35:23.949 --> 35:26.884
Excuse the mess.
We just had a staff meeting.

35:27.253 --> 35:28.914
Good. They're here.

35:29.121 --> 35:32.613
Temple Grandin,
I would like you to meet Mr. Hodges.

35:33.025 --> 35:35.255
He is our mathematics teacher.

35:35.661 --> 35:36.650
Temple, come here.

35:36.729 --> 35:38.253
Hello, I'm Temple. It's very nice to meet you.

35:38.330 --> 35:41.265
This is <i>Mademoiselle</i> Davide.
She is our French teacher.

35:41.333 --> 35:43.631
Hello, I'm Temple, very nice to meet you.

35:44.403 --> 35:46.928
Hi, I'm Dr. Carlock. I teach science.

35:47.039 --> 35:49.837
- Are you a scientist?
- Temple.

35:51.710 --> 35:54.474
Hello, I'm Temple, it's very nice to meet you.
Are you a scientist?

35:54.580 --> 35:56.514
I used to work for NASA.

35:59.018 --> 36:01.748
Temple's very interested in science.

36:01.821 --> 36:03.812
I'd like to meet Belka and Strelka.

36:03.889 --> 36:05.880
They're the first dogs
to come back from space alive.

36:05.958 --> 36:06.947
That's right.

36:07.026 --> 36:09.324
- In <i>Sputnik</i> 5, August 20th, 1960.
- <i>Sputnik</i> 5, August 20th, 1960.

36:14.333 --> 36:18.360
We're changing schools mid-term
because Temple's been expelled.

36:18.571 --> 36:20.903
I'm sorry, why was she expelled, again?

36:21.407 --> 36:23.500
Hitting another child with a book.

36:24.110 --> 36:27.273
There's no excuse,
but I will say this in her defense.

36:27.346 --> 36:31.146
I have never seen her strike
unless she's been provoked.

36:31.217 --> 36:35.950
And other children have taunted
and bullied her constantly.

36:36.522 --> 36:40.322
<i>They make fun of her because</i>
<i>she doesn't understand their jokes.</i>

36:40.392 --> 36:42.360
<i>She spins to comfort herself.</i>

36:42.428 --> 36:47.092
<i>She talks fast, often too fast,</i>
<i>and she talks repetitively,</i>

36:47.166 --> 36:50.033
<i>and then the children called her</i>
<i>a tape recorder.</i>

36:50.169 --> 36:54.333
Then she'll go into a panic attack,
and then they make fun of that, too.

36:54.406 --> 36:58.672
Excuse me.
When was she diagnosed autistic?

36:59.178 --> 37:03.137
She was four,
but I sometimes wonder if that's correct.

37:03.749 --> 37:05.444
Why do you say that?

37:05.518 --> 37:08.009
You've seen her, she's bright.

37:08.487 --> 37:12.651
We have a lot of experience with children
with special needs,

37:12.725 --> 37:16.217
and emotional problems,
neuro-behavioral issues

37:16.295 --> 37:18.820
that we've made a number...

37:19.899 --> 37:21.161
- I think that because of...
- I'm so sorry.

37:21.233 --> 37:24.862
I really have wasted your time.
I just can't do this to her.

37:25.971 --> 37:28.701
Mrs. Grandin. Mrs. Grandin. Mrs. Grandin!

37:28.974 --> 37:32.933
Mrs. Grandin, please! Can I speak with you
for a moment, please?

37:36.081 --> 37:39.983
Mrs. Grandin, you don't strike me as the
sort of person who would abuse their child

37:40.052 --> 37:42.247
or deny them love and care...

37:42.321 --> 37:47.258
I... Now, you wait.
I have done everything that I can for Temple

37:47.760 --> 37:51.526
and if it isn't good enough,
then it just isn't good enough.

37:51.597 --> 37:55.294
But you cannot even begin
to imagine the chaos,

37:55.367 --> 37:59.167
the upheavals, the tantrums and the pain.

37:59.238 --> 38:00.569
Her pain.

38:00.639 --> 38:04.598
You seem to be acting
as if you have done something wrong,

38:04.677 --> 38:07.771
when it's obvious
you've done everything right.

38:08.147 --> 38:10.081
I think she's terrific.

38:11.483 --> 38:15.180
I know it's difficult when, as parents,
we want our children

38:15.254 --> 38:17.814
to be everything we hoped for them to be

38:17.890 --> 38:21.326
and, if they're not,
we think it's our fault and...

38:21.393 --> 38:23.588
And that there's never ever anybody
out there who understands

38:23.662 --> 38:27.530
what we're going through.
It makes you feel alone, right?

38:29.401 --> 38:32.427
Mrs. Grandin,
I'm not an admissions person.

38:32.504 --> 38:34.665
I just teach science,

38:35.007 --> 38:38.807
but I feel that this school
might be the right place for your daughter.

38:38.877 --> 38:40.868
I'd love to have her here.

38:44.883 --> 38:48.979
The doctors wanted me
to institutionalize her and...

38:50.222 --> 38:53.020
I don't know.
Just dumping her at a boarding school,

38:53.092 --> 38:55.959
it just feels like another way to give her up.

38:56.028 --> 39:00.658
But it's... It's not. It's just the first step
in getting her out into the world.

39:03.602 --> 39:06.537
And I know you saw the children
making fun of her

39:06.605 --> 39:09.039
- and you want to protect her.
- Yeah, of course I do.

39:09.108 --> 39:10.803
Yeah, what parent doesn't want to?

39:10.876 --> 39:15.438
But at some point,
she's going to hit life head on.

39:15.514 --> 39:20.178
And trust me, we know how different she is.

39:24.189 --> 39:25.952
Different, not less.

39:27.492 --> 39:29.551
Different, but not less.

39:33.431 --> 39:35.194
You watch. You'll...

39:35.266 --> 39:38.429
You'll make friends
and you're gonna ride horses.

39:40.938 --> 39:42.838
- Okay?
- Okay.

39:47.011 --> 39:48.706
Okay.

41:40.124 --> 41:43.525
What are you doing in with Chestnut?
No one is to go near that horse!

41:43.594 --> 41:46.927
Can he be my horse?
He likes being hugged.

41:46.998 --> 41:48.556
I want to ride him.

41:48.633 --> 41:51.227
You'll ride. Just not Chestnut.

42:35.146 --> 42:37.444
Why are there so many fish in France?

42:41.018 --> 42:43.009
French fish! French fish!

43:01.772 --> 43:05.173
Excellent work, Temple.
Really excellent work.

43:09.347 --> 43:11.212
- French fish!
- French fish!

43:11.282 --> 43:13.477
- French fish!
- French fish!

43:14.685 --> 43:16.448
Hey! What happened here?

43:16.521 --> 43:18.989
- She hit him for no reason!
- Temple.

43:19.056 --> 43:20.455
Come on, let's go.

43:21.993 --> 43:24.655
- And he's done it before!
- Stop. Stop. Temple, stop.

43:25.263 --> 43:30.223
Temple, Tim will be punished
for what he did, but you cannot hit people.

43:30.635 --> 43:32.398
You understand that?

43:33.571 --> 43:37.667
Good. And to really get that through to you,
you will not ride for two weeks.

43:37.742 --> 43:40.802
- But that's not fair!
- Two weeks.

43:54.325 --> 43:57.192
No, no. There's... There's nothing there.

43:58.596 --> 44:00.894
And he's been like this for three hours?

44:01.299 --> 44:04.393
I don't think there's anything
anybody could have done.

44:06.237 --> 44:08.705
I'll send the boy around with the truck.
Can you do it?

44:08.773 --> 44:10.400
I'll take care of it, Dad.

44:31.629 --> 44:32.891
Temple?

44:44.942 --> 44:46.637
Where do they go?

44:47.378 --> 44:48.777
I don't know.

44:49.814 --> 44:53.181
Heaven, maybe. Somewhere.

44:56.754 --> 45:01.453
Temple, when animals and people die,

45:01.993 --> 45:04.723
they stay with us in our minds.

45:04.996 --> 45:06.793
We can still see them.

45:06.864 --> 45:10.425
So I think it would be best
not to remember Chestnut like this.

45:11.002 --> 45:12.128
Okay?

45:13.404 --> 45:17.067
I see Chestnut the day I arrived.
I see grooming Chestnut.

45:17.308 --> 45:19.776
I see a picture of a horse
just like Chestnut in a book.

45:19.977 --> 45:22.844
We passed a Chestnut horse
on route 119 near a feed store.

45:22.913 --> 45:26.007
<i>There was one on a calendar at Aunt Ann's,</i>
<i>there was one in</i> Life <i>magazine</i>

45:26.083 --> 45:29.177
- opposite the page of Mr. Kennedy...
- Okay. Okay.

45:29.687 --> 45:32.815
Can you bring everything you've seen
to your mind?

45:34.191 --> 45:35.215
Sure.

45:35.292 --> 45:39.592
Even if it were an everyday object,
like, say, shoes?

45:40.931 --> 45:43.922
I see all the shoes I've worn,
my mother's and other people I've met.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.434
And you have three pairs,
one needs a new heel.

45:46.503 --> 45:49.597
And I see the newspaper ads
and TV ads and...

45:51.641 --> 45:52.972
Can't you?

45:53.209 --> 45:56.406
- This girl has an amazing mind.
- Try teaching her math.

45:56.479 --> 45:58.447
- Her algebra's hopeless.
- Or French.

45:58.515 --> 46:01.882
- "Why are there so many fish in France?"
- I want to show you something.

46:02.919 --> 46:04.511
She thinks in pictures.

46:05.055 --> 46:08.491
That's why she does so well when she can
see the things that are being discussed.

46:08.558 --> 46:10.617
Like biology.

46:10.994 --> 46:14.361
Or... Or shop.

46:14.698 --> 46:18.634
Those are concrete things.
But language or algebra?

46:18.702 --> 46:21.193
- It's just gibberish to her.
- What's that?

46:21.871 --> 46:24.066
Do you want to see your "French fish"?

46:25.375 --> 46:27.036
"The eels ate."

46:29.312 --> 46:30.677
"Eel ate."

46:33.850 --> 46:36.876
French is full of "Eels."
And this is what she sees.

46:37.253 --> 46:39.687
She's an amazing visual thinker.

46:45.862 --> 46:48.194
- Let me work with her.
- Fine.

46:50.967 --> 46:54.596
We have five minutes left.
Who wants to see a movie?

46:55.071 --> 46:56.504
- Yeah!
- All right.

47:01.878 --> 47:04.403
- J.D., will you do the projector?
- Okay.

47:07.150 --> 47:09.618
All right.
Now everybody watch very carefully

47:09.686 --> 47:13.645
because this one
is all about optical illusions.

47:14.891 --> 47:18.486
<i>It comes as a distinct shock to most people</i>
<i>when they realize how limited</i>

47:18.561 --> 47:21.621
<i>and how inaccurate</i>
<i>the human senses really are.</i>

47:22.532 --> 47:26.400
<i>In this house, faces at the window seem to</i>
<i>come in assorted sizes, don't they?</i>

47:26.469 --> 47:29.063
That looks like Mr. Povey, doesn't it?

47:29.239 --> 47:32.868
<i>But there's nothing wrong with the faces.</i>
<i>It's those windows</i>

47:33.276 --> 47:35.210
<i>and what they're doing to your brain.</i>

47:35.378 --> 47:36.777
All right, here we go.

47:37.113 --> 47:39.104
<i>A small one and a tall one.</i>

47:41.751 --> 47:44.618
<i>Let's see if we can even things out a bit.</i>

47:48.792 --> 47:50.623
- How do they do that?
- Sit down!

47:50.693 --> 47:53.628
All right, please.
Temple, sit down, please. J.D.

47:54.297 --> 47:56.925
That is the question, isn't it?
"How did they do that?"

47:57.567 --> 48:01.503
Well, that's this week's assignment.
I want one page, at least.

48:01.671 --> 48:03.502
- A full page?
- All right, two?

48:03.673 --> 48:06.233
- No, no, no, no.
- All right, one page. Okay.

48:06.376 --> 48:10.107
- They mess with the perspective!
- That's right, Temple.

48:10.380 --> 48:12.678
And it was a room built
with distorted perspective.

48:12.749 --> 48:15.582
- But how?
- Well, do you think you could figure it out?

48:16.019 --> 48:18.112
Maybe if you visualized it?

48:19.088 --> 48:21.852
And if you build one,
I'll give you extra credit.

48:23.393 --> 48:24.792
Yeah, okay.

48:35.672 --> 48:36.900
Hey!

48:40.109 --> 48:41.269
Weirdo!

48:43.713 --> 48:46.204
Does she have to chalk the walls?

48:51.988 --> 48:53.478
Look at her.

49:23.419 --> 49:25.478
- I can't do it!
- I think you can, Temple.

49:25.555 --> 49:28.456
But I can't!
I know, I know. I shouldn't shout.

49:28.658 --> 49:31.286
But measuring perspective didn't work!

49:55.618 --> 49:58.610
Hey, Leigh,
these are the specifications you need.

50:01.057 --> 50:02.752
Success, Temple?

50:02.825 --> 50:05.817
No! Give me a clue, please!

50:07.897 --> 50:10.161
You have to think
of all the features in the room,

50:10.233 --> 50:14.169
the walls, the floors,
the ceilings, the doors.

50:14.237 --> 50:15.431
Got it!

50:21.611 --> 50:24.307
You've already gone through this, right?
You saw...

50:25.181 --> 50:26.546
Well, you can tell that that's
how she painted it.

50:26.616 --> 50:29.414
This is what she was working on
the other day.

50:29.485 --> 50:32.977
I want to go through this.
It's a strange optical illusion.

50:36.926 --> 50:38.723
Well, as you can see,

50:39.829 --> 50:42.354
the horses are the exact same size.

50:45.768 --> 50:48.566
And here is the room.

50:52.308 --> 50:54.276
Temple, congratulations.

50:55.278 --> 50:58.338
I think this deserves a round of applause.

51:02.585 --> 51:05.315
I think it deserves a celebration.

51:05.388 --> 51:07.117
Yeah!

51:09.292 --> 51:13.661
Five, four, three, two, one.

51:36.052 --> 51:37.917
Now, here's a question.

51:38.721 --> 51:42.020
If I wind this up and then let go,

51:42.091 --> 51:45.959
why doesn't the propeller stay still
and the body of the plane spin around?

51:46.095 --> 51:48.620
That's simple. The resistance of the wings.

51:48.698 --> 51:51.189
- That's absolutely right.
- And watch this.

51:54.837 --> 51:56.304
With no wings

51:58.374 --> 52:00.671
and just one plane of resistance,

52:09.451 --> 52:12.909
- you have a helicopter!
- You're absolutely right.

52:14.623 --> 52:18.684
Temple. You have a very special mind,
you know that?

52:19.428 --> 52:22.090
You see the world in ways that others can't,

52:22.831 --> 52:24.765
and that's quite an advantage.

52:24.833 --> 52:29.497
And you know something? If you weren't
such a goof and you developed this talent,

52:29.571 --> 52:32.039
you could easily go on to college.

52:32.641 --> 52:34.233
What would I do at college?

52:34.309 --> 52:38.040
Well, with your mind,
anything you wanted to. Pick a subject.

52:42.284 --> 52:44.946
Cows. Do they have colleges with cows?

52:45.020 --> 52:48.547
Yes, they do. And horses and pigs
and goats and sheep and...

52:49.191 --> 52:51.386
Yeah, it's called animal husbandry.

52:55.764 --> 52:59.700
- Animal husbandry.
- Yeah, and it deals with the care of animals.

53:01.169 --> 53:05.265
Really, anything you wanted.
You could study people, psychology.

53:05.674 --> 53:07.869
I'd get to understand people?

53:07.943 --> 53:09.706
Well, that's the idea.

53:12.814 --> 53:14.406
I'll stay here.

53:16.685 --> 53:19.483
Temple, think of it as a door.

53:21.756 --> 53:25.692
A door that's going to open up
onto a whole new world for you

53:25.760 --> 53:29.127
and all you need to do
is decide to go through it.

53:51.052 --> 53:52.212
- Miss Grandin?
- First off,

53:52.287 --> 53:54.983
I talked to my old teacher Dr. Carlock.
And he said I should stress

53:55.056 --> 53:57.718
that it wasn't that I hadn't done the work,
because I had,

53:57.792 --> 53:59.384
but I'd collected way too much data

53:59.461 --> 54:01.691
and backed it up
with far too many citations,

54:01.763 --> 54:04.823
that I needed extra time
just to make it coherent.

54:04.900 --> 54:07.698
But if you look at these results,
you'll see that it's not just me, but in fact,

54:07.769 --> 54:10.795
a majority of people who become calmer
when using my machine.

54:10.872 --> 54:14.069
And that really makes
a clear case for me keeping it.

54:14.142 --> 54:16.076
And I should get a good grade.

54:16.144 --> 54:18.704
- Did your...
- Certainly more than a pass.

54:19.881 --> 54:22.577
Did your previous teacher, Dr. Carlock,
suggest the good grade?

54:22.651 --> 54:24.175
No, that's me.

54:24.920 --> 54:26.581
Leave it with me.

54:28.790 --> 54:30.917
This is very important work!

54:45.307 --> 54:46.535
You used a control group?

54:46.608 --> 54:51.045
They were tested resting, seated,
and most of them got bored. Page four.

54:58.653 --> 55:02.214
This is excellent.
And I think it will be a good grade.

55:03.225 --> 55:05.022
So I keep my machine.

55:06.628 --> 55:08.323
In that case, I'll stay.

55:09.664 --> 55:10.892
I would imagine your new roommate

55:10.966 --> 55:14.129
will want a say
in whether you keep the machine.

55:24.546 --> 55:26.537
That's my squeeze machine.

55:26.615 --> 55:28.708
- Do I have to move it?
- No.

55:29.417 --> 55:33.547
But don't ever move it
and then I'll always know where it is.

55:34.589 --> 55:35.681
Okay.

55:37.392 --> 55:39.724
It's almost time for <i>The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</i>

55:39.794 --> 55:41.659
They play it in the rec room.

55:41.730 --> 55:44.528
Do you want to watch
<i>The Man from U.N.C.L.E.?</i>

55:46.368 --> 55:48.233
You can't watch <i>The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</i>

55:48.303 --> 55:50.737
I do. I'd love to watch it.

55:51.406 --> 55:54.000
- Will you show me where it is?
- Yeah, sure.

56:17.632 --> 56:21.466
Now Illya Kuryakin's trying
to open the door, but it's locked.

56:23.638 --> 56:26.402
And now the floor's sliding under the room.

56:26.975 --> 56:29.569
There's a big drop to lots of spikes!

56:30.011 --> 56:32.844
That's the other kids in the room hissing.

56:34.516 --> 56:37.178
- Do you like <i>Star Trek,</i> too?
- Yes.

56:38.119 --> 56:40.781
- Who's your favorite?
- Mr. Spock.

56:41.890 --> 56:43.824
We have a lot in common.

56:44.059 --> 56:45.890
Maybe we can watch it on the radio.

56:46.461 --> 56:49.021
- They broadcast it for the blind.
- They do?

56:49.798 --> 56:51.891
Let's watch it on the radio.

56:55.103 --> 56:56.832
You're quieter now.

56:58.073 --> 57:00.974
Is that because
you're in your squeeze machine?

57:02.377 --> 57:04.538
I was just getting out.

57:08.283 --> 57:11.411
- Is my voice that different?
- It is to me.

57:11.886 --> 57:14.684
Remember, I see you through your voice.

57:15.323 --> 57:17.791
Do you remember a lot of voices?

57:17.859 --> 57:21.920
Of course.
But I remember the sounds of places, too.

57:24.866 --> 57:28.996
We're the same, only you have sounds
and I have pictures.

57:31.539 --> 57:33.268
I'm off to class.

57:35.143 --> 57:40.877
I have French class. I hate it.
That's why I'm in my squeeze machine.

57:41.316 --> 57:44.012
Your squeeze machine doesn't bother me.

57:44.386 --> 57:46.251
- Okay?
- I know. Okay.

57:49.758 --> 57:51.225
Good luck.

57:53.628 --> 57:54.959
Thank you.

58:12.881 --> 58:14.872
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

58:16.483 --> 58:17.575
No.

58:24.224 --> 58:27.489
<i>I've always wanted to understand</i>
<i>the gentleness that other people feel</i>

58:27.594 --> 58:30.154
<i>by being hugged by their mothers.</i>

58:30.531 --> 58:33.591
<i>And now I've made a machine</i>
<i>that lets me do that.</i>

58:33.901 --> 58:36.631
<i>It feels like a wire gets reconnected.</i>

58:37.004 --> 58:39.199
<i>Like something gets repaired.</i>

58:41.708 --> 58:45.508
If it wasn't for my machine,
I wouldn't be standing here today.

58:45.579 --> 58:49.640
Instead I'd be hiding in my room
or spinning in circles to calm myself,

58:49.716 --> 58:51.445
or hitting someone.

58:53.086 --> 58:56.522
When I was younger,
I closed myself off from people.

58:56.590 --> 58:59.388
I didn't even speak until I was four.

58:59.726 --> 59:03.355
There's a highfalutin name
for this condition. Autism.

59:11.371 --> 59:13.100
But because of my machine,

59:13.173 --> 59:16.506
I'm able to know the kindness and love
that have been given to me

59:16.577 --> 59:18.909
to reach this point in my life.

59:19.213 --> 59:22.774
Today more than ever,
I realize I have not walked alone.

59:22.850 --> 59:27.014
And I thank not only my teachers,
but my friends and family as well.

59:27.588 --> 59:30.386
As in the words of the song from <i>Carousel.</i>

59:32.493 --> 59:38.830
<i>When you walk through a storm</i>
<i>Hold your head up high</i>

59:39.099 --> 59:44.162
<i>And don't be afraid of the dark</i>

59:44.238 --> 59:50.268
<i>At the end of a storm is a golden sky</i>

59:50.544 --> 59:56.210
<i>And a sweet silver song of a lark</i>

59:56.517 --> 01:00:02.581
<i>Walk on through the wind</i>
<i>Walk on through the rain</i>

01:00:02.856 --> 01:00:08.055
<i>Though your dreams be tossed and blown</i>

01:00:08.395 --> 01:00:11.626
<i>Walk on, walk on</i>

01:00:11.798 --> 01:00:14.164
<i>With hope in your heart</i>

01:00:14.234 --> 01:00:18.898
<i>And you'll never walk alone</i>

01:00:19.306 --> 01:00:25.267
<i>You'll never walk alone</i>

01:01:44.858 --> 01:01:46.450
This is my door.

01:01:47.828 --> 01:01:49.853
It opens to another world.

01:02:21.995 --> 01:02:24.156
Arizona State students, gather around.

01:02:24.231 --> 01:02:26.665
All right. Come on, everybody.
Come on down this way.

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:30.666
Here we go. All right, come on in.
Here we go. Here we go.

01:02:30.737 --> 01:02:32.932
Everybody, come on. Let's go.

01:02:33.707 --> 01:02:36.505
All right, come on in closer now.
Gather around so you can hear.

01:02:36.576 --> 01:02:38.100
All right, class, listen up.

01:02:38.178 --> 01:02:40.840
This is Don Michaels. He runs the feedlot.

01:02:40.914 --> 01:02:42.541
Thanks, Professor.

01:02:42.616 --> 01:02:46.985
All right, what we got here at any one time
is about 50, 52,000 head of cattle.

01:02:47.187 --> 01:02:50.122
Now, they gotta weigh 650 pounds
to get in here.

01:02:50.257 --> 01:02:52.487
During the three or four months
they spend here, they'll put on

01:02:52.559 --> 01:02:56.222
another 400 pounds before they
move into the big house for slaughtering.

01:02:56.296 --> 01:02:58.992
Well, while they're here fattening up,
we got to keep them healthy.

01:02:59.066 --> 01:03:01.796
So one of the first things we do
when they come in off the range

01:03:01.868 --> 01:03:04.860
is put them through a dip,
get rid of any bugs.

01:03:05.839 --> 01:03:09.070
- Excuse me there, buddy. You okay?
- That's a girl.

01:03:09.509 --> 01:03:10.976
Miss Grandin.

01:03:11.378 --> 01:03:13.369
Miss, are you with us, here?

01:03:13.447 --> 01:03:16.473
- I was listening to the cattle.
- Oh, yeah?

01:03:16.917 --> 01:03:21.354
Why are some mooing more loudly than
others? I never heard so much mooing!

01:03:21.421 --> 01:03:24.288
Honey, I've been around
cattle all my working life.

01:03:24.391 --> 01:03:27.554
About all I can tell you is that,
just like the female of the species,

01:03:27.661 --> 01:03:30.892
cattle love to yammer and gossip or sulk.

01:03:31.431 --> 01:03:34.025
It's always just one thing or the other.

01:03:34.101 --> 01:03:35.830
- But like I was saying...
- Well, there must be a reason.

01:03:35.902 --> 01:03:37.597
They're saying something.

01:03:38.004 --> 01:03:42.998
Well, I reckon you could get Dr. Dolittle
on out here. He probably could tell you.

01:03:43.110 --> 01:03:46.204
While missy here is listening to what
the cattle are saying to each other,

01:03:46.279 --> 01:03:49.442
why don't you boys step over here
with me and see a dip in action?

01:04:00.127 --> 01:04:02.288
Now, the biggest problem
you got with a dip vat

01:04:02.362 --> 01:04:05.854
is that cattle can swim all right
unless they tip on over.

01:04:05.932 --> 01:04:07.866
Then them babies'll drown real fast on you

01:04:07.934 --> 01:04:10.903
unless you get a hold of them
and haul them out.

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:21.541
Get up there. Go!

01:04:26.386 --> 01:04:28.877
Well, there you go!
See, this is what I was telling you.

01:04:29.189 --> 01:04:30.178
Jesus!

01:04:35.161 --> 01:04:37.595
Come on, boys. Earn your money!

01:04:39.298 --> 01:04:41.926
Hold them up over there! Hold them up!

01:04:44.003 --> 01:04:46.096
Come on, boys. We're gonna lose that baby.

01:04:48.107 --> 01:04:51.406
Roy! Roy, get a rope on this heifer
and drag it out!

01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:06.358
Okay. Okay.

01:05:06.458 --> 01:05:09.655
Well, there you go. You'll see inside.
It'll take more than that to kill a cow.

01:05:09.728 --> 01:05:12.390
- Get up! Get up!
- Do you lose many?

01:05:12.898 --> 01:05:15.423
Well, we got to run 300 of them
through here in an hour.

01:05:15.501 --> 01:05:19.801
I guess in a week, we'll lose
one or two maybe. We're doing pretty good.

01:05:30.783 --> 01:05:34.184
Dolittle, how you holding up?
Too much for you?

01:05:34.987 --> 01:05:37.217
They like to walk in circles.

01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:41.255
Well, what do you know, boys?
Cattle like to walk in circles!

01:05:41.327 --> 01:05:43.488
Dang, give that girl a prize.

01:05:43.829 --> 01:05:47.765
It calms them down. They walk
in circles away from the handlers.

01:05:48.734 --> 01:05:51.703
Maybe you ought to wait out here
when we go inside.

01:05:59.745 --> 01:06:00.939
Go!

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:12.482
Then when we have it in the cage,
it just takes one knock to the head.

01:06:23.102 --> 01:06:25.593
So, Dolittle, what do you think?

01:06:28.874 --> 01:06:32.310
- Where does it go?
- Meat processing.

01:06:34.079 --> 01:06:35.944
No, where does it go?

01:06:36.348 --> 01:06:38.782
It was here, and now it's meat.

01:06:39.785 --> 01:06:41.446
Where did it go?

01:06:42.187 --> 01:06:47.318
Professor, I think maybe your young lady
here ought to consider another line of work.

01:07:29.435 --> 01:07:32.802
Mooing? You want to do research
and write your master's on mooing?

01:07:32.871 --> 01:07:35.840
Curves. Cattle like curves.
They don't moo at curves.

01:07:35.908 --> 01:07:37.808
Miss Grandin, when we accepted you,

01:07:37.876 --> 01:07:41.073
we were impressed you had excelled
at your previous school.

01:07:41.146 --> 01:07:44.912
A master's thesis on mooing
strikes me as a lowering of the bar

01:07:44.984 --> 01:07:46.781
and I, for one, will not be the first person

01:07:46.852 --> 01:07:49.650
to give you an easy ride
because of your autism.

01:07:49.722 --> 01:07:51.781
- Come up with something...
- Cattle are prey animals.

01:07:51.857 --> 01:07:55.020
My autism allows me
to understand prey animals well.

01:07:55.094 --> 01:07:57.995
I can visualize the flight zones of cattle.

01:07:58.230 --> 01:08:00.027
A handler outside the flight zone

01:08:00.099 --> 01:08:02.829
can keep an animal circling
in a calm and orderly manner.

01:08:02.901 --> 01:08:05.768
But stepping into the flight zone
panics the cattle,

01:08:05.838 --> 01:08:09.069
and they change from soft moos
to loud mooing.

01:08:09.174 --> 01:08:11.938
Like, prey animals don't make noises
that will draw attention to them

01:08:12.011 --> 01:08:14.138
unless they're trying to warn
other members of the herd.

01:08:14.213 --> 01:08:16.477
So they're warning each other
they're going to be slaughtered?

01:08:16.548 --> 01:08:17.947
No. No. No, sir.

01:08:18.017 --> 01:08:20.577
The loud mooing is the same
whether they're gonna be dipped,

01:08:20.652 --> 01:08:22.984
driven around a hard corner
or taken to slaughter.

01:08:23.055 --> 01:08:24.988
I mean, they have no idea
what's gonna happen to them...

01:08:25.057 --> 01:08:27.082
- I'm glad we agree on that.
...but they're spooked.

01:08:27.158 --> 01:08:29.524
And spooked cattle don't act straight.

01:08:29.928 --> 01:08:34.796
They get bruised, scraped, drowned,
and that all costs money.

01:08:34.966 --> 01:08:38.595
And it takes a good half hour to calm
a herd and that costs money, too.

01:08:38.770 --> 01:08:40.966
It's not a good way to run a stockyard.

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:45.033
Well, I believe what's good for cattle
is also good for business.

01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:52.810
Well, get the yard to sign off on it.

01:08:53.886 --> 01:08:56.821
- You mean Don.
- That's who's in charge.

01:09:04.095 --> 01:09:06.529
Sorry, ma'am. No women on the lot.

01:09:06.965 --> 01:09:09.365
My name is Temple Grandin.
I'm a grad student at Arizona State...

01:09:09.435 --> 01:09:11.426
That's the rules, ma'am.

01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:14.529
I'm a grad student at Arizona State
and I was here last week.

01:09:14.606 --> 01:09:18.372
Complaints from cowboys' wives.
They just don't want no women on the yard.

01:09:19.178 --> 01:09:20.304
I'm just doing my job.

01:09:24.716 --> 01:09:26.774
Ma'am, you're holding up the line.

01:09:26.852 --> 01:09:30.310
You're going to have to turn around
and take it on off the lot. If you please.

01:09:34.359 --> 01:09:35.724
Don't come back.

01:09:37.996 --> 01:09:40.487
John Richmond, press,
<i>Ranchman</i> magazine.

01:09:40.566 --> 01:09:41.828
Go on in.

01:09:50.676 --> 01:09:52.041
<i>It's a door.</i>

01:09:52.978 --> 01:09:54.673
<i>It's another door.</i>

01:10:06.959 --> 01:10:08.824
Thanks, ma'am. Take care.

01:10:45.063 --> 01:10:46.792
- Good morning.
- Go on in.

01:10:54.772 --> 01:10:56.740
- Morning.
- Go on in.

01:11:03.381 --> 01:11:05.212
- Hi, Sanch.
- Hey. Hey, there.

01:11:05.850 --> 01:11:08.512
Good to have you back, son. Seems like
a long time since you worked out here.

01:11:08.586 --> 01:11:09.746
Yeah, it does.

01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:11.754
- What is this, a Purple Heart?
- Yeah, it is.

01:11:11.822 --> 01:11:13.517
We're real proud of you.

01:11:13.591 --> 01:11:16.151
Gee, Sanch, you didn't get all these
just digging latrines.

01:11:16.227 --> 01:11:18.286
- No, sir. I was in Khe Sanh.
- Good for you.

01:11:18.362 --> 01:11:21.195
Excuse me, sir. I need you to sign off
on my master's thesis.

01:11:21.299 --> 01:11:23.927
- How'd you get in here?
- They just waved me in.

01:11:24.735 --> 01:11:28.171
- What are you gonna research?
- Agitation in cattle.

01:11:28.773 --> 01:11:32.539
Would that be mooing?
You believe that crap?

01:11:32.977 --> 01:11:35.241
Since cattle are prey animals,
loud mooing is a sign of...

01:11:35.313 --> 01:11:36.837
No way.

01:11:37.982 --> 01:11:39.847
Come on, Sanch, let's get some coffee.

01:11:39.917 --> 01:11:42.078
Say, did you bring back
one of them little China gals with you?

01:11:42.153 --> 01:11:45.247
No, they wouldn't let me bring back one
on the airplane none.

01:11:45.890 --> 01:11:48.256
You girls got the coffee ready in here?

01:11:48.326 --> 01:11:50.760
- We got a man that's thirsty.
- Come on in!

01:12:16.954 --> 01:12:19.013
Do you have another entrance?

01:12:20.625 --> 01:12:23.560
- Pardon?
- Do you have another entrance?

01:12:24.328 --> 01:12:25.886
No, ma'am.

01:12:38.876 --> 01:12:40.639
Do you have any Jell-O or yogurt?

01:12:40.711 --> 01:12:43.441
In the cooler. Right behind you, darling.

01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:18.574
<i>By eating the weaker and slower ones,</i>

01:13:18.649 --> 01:13:22.915
<i>lions keep the antelope population strong</i>
<i>and in proper proportion</i>

01:13:22.987 --> 01:13:24.716
<i>to all other animals.</i>

01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:51.548
Light. Shadow.

01:14:06.030 --> 01:14:08.225
Reflections on puddle.

01:14:49.473 --> 01:14:51.703
I've eaten bulls' testicles!

01:14:51.776 --> 01:14:54.904
Ate them in my aunt's ranch. Regularly!

01:14:58.916 --> 01:15:00.508
This is a waste!

01:15:55.105 --> 01:15:56.231
Hey!

01:15:57.575 --> 01:16:00.100
You gotta remember to drink out here.

01:16:00.177 --> 01:16:03.237
Well, I have data on things
that make them balk, like shadows,

01:16:03.314 --> 01:16:05.748
reflections on water,
a chain glinting in the sun.

01:16:05.816 --> 01:16:07.545
- Is that right?
- They won't walk into shaded areas.

01:16:07.618 --> 01:16:08.812
They need to see where they're going.

01:16:08.886 --> 01:16:12.754
I've lots of important information on all this
and I need Mr. Michaels to sign off on it.

01:16:12.823 --> 01:16:14.814
Don? Don don't sign nothing.

01:16:14.892 --> 01:16:17.417
- I need Mr. Michaels to sign...
- You're not hearing me right.

01:16:17.495 --> 01:16:19.429
Don don't sign nothing.

01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:21.725
I sign everything around here.

01:16:22.967 --> 01:16:26.835
His signature, but I do the signing.

01:16:27.671 --> 01:16:30.037
I'm not even sure if Don can write.

01:16:33.010 --> 01:16:36.377
Say, if you're interested in cattle
and how cattle act,

01:16:36.447 --> 01:16:38.915
you shouldn't just hang around feedlots.

01:16:38.983 --> 01:16:43.920
You should be out on ranches,
auctions, rodeos, that sort of thing.

01:16:49.793 --> 01:16:51.522
Got the big steer here. 1,000 pounds.

01:16:51.595 --> 01:16:56.157
Let's see what she got here. 20, 25,
25, 25 and a half. 25 and a half, 75.

01:16:56.233 --> 01:16:58.167
- Twenty five, 75, 25...
- He looks mean.

01:16:58.235 --> 01:17:02.365
Twenty five. 75, 30, 30, 30, 30.
Sold him. Pat 17.

01:17:04.307 --> 01:17:05.569
Lookit, here's mama here.

01:17:05.642 --> 01:17:08.167
Now, 75. 25, 25, 25.

01:17:08.244 --> 01:17:11.577
25, 27 and a half. He's 27 and a half.
30, 32 and a half, 35.

01:17:11.648 --> 01:17:13.616
Sold him. Pat 21. Pat 21.

01:17:16.286 --> 01:17:18.914
The <i>Arizona Ranchman.</i>
We got real estate. We got...

01:17:30.233 --> 01:17:32.224
Yeah, it's a good magazine.
I'd like you to take a look at it.

01:17:32.302 --> 01:17:34.827
Help you out with
all kinds of cattle questions.

01:17:37.774 --> 01:17:40.641
See you back here
in about five minutes, okay?

01:17:40.710 --> 01:17:41.802
Excuse...

01:17:46.583 --> 01:17:48.813
It's all doors to new worlds.

01:17:57.827 --> 01:18:01.285
Excuse me, sir? Sir?
I'm very pleased to meet you.

01:18:01.364 --> 01:18:03.730
I'm Temple Grandin, a Bachelor of Science,

01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:05.631
doing my master's here at Arizona State,

01:18:05.702 --> 01:18:07.602
currently studying
in Scottsdale Feed Yards,

01:18:07.704 --> 01:18:11.196
and I was wondering if I could interest
the <i>Arizona Farmer-Ranchman</i> periodical

01:18:11.274 --> 01:18:13.936
on a thesis I'm writing
on control systems and cattle

01:18:14.010 --> 01:18:17.810
and why some work better than others
and how they can tell the difference.

01:18:18.748 --> 01:18:22.081
How'd you get on with old Don Michaels
over at Scottsdale?

01:18:22.919 --> 01:18:25.615
I told him I've eaten bull testicles, sir.

01:18:27.557 --> 01:18:29.821
Well, I will read anything you send in,
Miss Grandin.

01:18:29.892 --> 01:18:34.852
In fact, here, take my card.
You address it directly to me.

01:18:36.332 --> 01:18:39.028
Thank you, sir. Thank you!

01:18:42.772 --> 01:18:44.000
It's open.

01:18:44.974 --> 01:18:48.808
Sir, Scottsdale Feedlot signed off
on my cattle agitation study.

01:18:48.878 --> 01:18:51.574
Smells like half the herd signed it first.

01:18:52.915 --> 01:18:55.884
- No, sir. Cattle can't do that.
- And I don't need the magazine.

01:18:55.952 --> 01:18:57.283
I'm a subscriber.

01:18:57.353 --> 01:18:59.719
Well, I just wanted to make sure
you saw my article

01:18:59.789 --> 01:19:02.383
on mooing as a guide to cattle agitation.

01:19:02.458 --> 01:19:05.052
Full thesis is still at the typist,
but you should have it by Friday.

01:19:05.128 --> 01:19:06.220
Temple?

01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:13.634
- Let's go sing near the fire.
- No, Ralf.

01:19:15.238 --> 01:19:16.830
Merry Christmas!

01:19:16.906 --> 01:19:18.100
Temple!

01:19:18.441 --> 01:19:21.103
Well, Master of Science.

01:19:21.611 --> 01:19:25.069
- Master of Science in Animal Science.
- Fantastic.

01:19:25.181 --> 01:19:27.172
I'll bet you're glad to be back East.

01:19:27.250 --> 01:19:31.311
- I like the West.
- So do I, but it isn't home, is it?

01:19:31.387 --> 01:19:33.150
What will you do with your master's?

01:19:33.222 --> 01:19:35.019
Your mother mentioned teaching maybe.

01:19:35.091 --> 01:19:37.218
Great new school over West Medford way.

01:19:37.293 --> 01:19:39.761
I have a lot more research
to do and things to write. So...

01:19:39.829 --> 01:19:41.797
That's right, you've been published.

01:19:41.864 --> 01:19:43.593
You remember Scott?

01:19:43.866 --> 01:19:45.094
- Scott?
- Scott?

01:19:45.168 --> 01:19:46.499
Scotty, over here.

01:19:46.569 --> 01:19:48.161
- I'll be right back.
- He's our oldest boy.

01:19:48.237 --> 01:19:51.070
<i>New York Magazine's</i> taken a piece of his.

01:19:51.541 --> 01:19:53.270
You remember Scott?

01:19:53.409 --> 01:19:55.036
He used to spit in my Jell-O.

01:19:55.111 --> 01:20:00.139
I'm sure he didn't.
Temple, tell Scott about your writing.

01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:05.081
I published two articles
in the <i>Arizona Farmer-Ranchman.</i>

01:20:05.621 --> 01:20:07.919
- The <i>Arizona...</i>
- The <i>Arizona Farmer-Ranchman.</i>

01:20:08.324 --> 01:20:10.554
One was on good moos and bad moos.

01:20:10.626 --> 01:20:13.823
The other was on head restraints
in cattle chutes and killing pens.

01:20:13.896 --> 01:20:17.525
They're really badly designed.
Just terrible systems. Just...

01:20:19.302 --> 01:20:21.600
It's lovely to see you, Temple.

01:20:22.271 --> 01:20:25.331
- Bye.
- Merry Christmas.

01:20:26.776 --> 01:20:28.175
Merry Christmas!

01:20:30.012 --> 01:20:32.606
I need my squeeze machine!

01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:39.178
I hate parties.

01:20:39.555 --> 01:20:42.319
There are too many people
and no one listens to me.

01:20:42.391 --> 01:20:45.656
And they keep giving each other looks
and I don't know what they mean.

01:20:45.728 --> 01:20:47.855
They're just uncomfortable.

01:20:48.798 --> 01:20:52.757
People don't want to hear
all those details about cattle.

01:20:52.835 --> 01:20:55.099
Well, I do. I wanna be with cattle.

01:20:55.171 --> 01:20:58.436
Sweetheart, I don't want you
to avoid people.

01:20:59.675 --> 01:21:03.042
- They make me feel bad.
- Then ignore them.

01:21:04.781 --> 01:21:09.013
You are the only Master of Science
in the room.

01:21:10.153 --> 01:21:12.678
And I am so proud of you.

01:21:13.422 --> 01:21:16.448
Temple, look at me. Look at me.

01:21:16.959 --> 01:21:21.089
Do you know how people tell each other
things with their eyes?

01:21:22.799 --> 01:21:28.101
This is me telling you
that I love you and I respect you.

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:39.840
I will never learn how to do that.

01:21:42.018 --> 01:21:43.280
I know.

01:22:07.543 --> 01:22:10.444
Hey! Damn it!

01:22:12.114 --> 01:22:13.672
You are not allowed in here.

01:22:13.749 --> 01:22:15.649
- I'm doing research for an article...
- No, ma'am.

01:22:15.718 --> 01:22:18.585
We put up with you sneaking in here
when you was at Arizona State,

01:22:18.654 --> 01:22:19.643
but you're done with that.

01:22:19.722 --> 01:22:23.385
No college, no insurance coverage,
no access.

01:22:36.839 --> 01:22:39.205
<i>There are many other articles</i>
<i>I would like to write for you.</i>

01:22:39.275 --> 01:22:42.506
Firstly, how cattle can be introduced
into dip vats on their own accord.

01:22:42.578 --> 01:22:45.103
- Secondly...
- Hold on, Miss Grandin.

01:22:45.281 --> 01:22:49.411
Firstly, your articles have been
greatly appreciated. I got a lot of calls.

01:22:49.485 --> 01:22:51.350
Folks think you talk sense.

01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:55.322
Secondly, I told you
I would read anything that you write.

01:22:55.391 --> 01:22:58.918
And, thirdly, young lady,
you need another set of clothes

01:22:58.995 --> 01:23:01.793
- when you come into town on business.
- I need to be an accredited press person.

01:23:01.864 --> 01:23:05.231
- Can I get a press pass?
- You asking for a staff job?

01:23:06.535 --> 01:23:10.562
I ain't got but four staff, and two
of them are bookkeeping and distribution.

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:14.371
No, I don't wanna work here.
I wanna be with cattle, so I need a pass.

01:23:15.144 --> 01:23:18.045
Well, we can do that. But like I said...

01:23:19.581 --> 01:23:21.708
Mary-Anne? Get in here.

01:23:24.586 --> 01:23:25.780
Sir?

01:23:26.488 --> 01:23:28.718
How's that working for you, Miss Grandin?

01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:31.224
It doesn't itch. I like it a lot.

01:23:37.098 --> 01:23:40.295
That's my rank. They'll be able to see that.

01:23:43.338 --> 01:23:45.238
Hey, what... Damn it!

01:24:01.056 --> 01:24:03.047
Use it, Temple. You stink.

01:24:03.191 --> 01:24:05.284
- Thank you.
- Temple?

01:24:05.961 --> 01:24:07.690
Miss Temple Grandin?

01:24:08.263 --> 01:24:10.925
I'm Ted Gilbert, from
John Wayne's Red River Feedlot.

01:24:11.032 --> 01:24:12.499
Hello, I'm very pleased to meet you.

01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:16.696
Hell, I've been reading your stuff.
How'd you like to put it into practice?

01:24:16.771 --> 01:24:20.138
See, I lost my designer
and I need a new cattle dip.

01:24:20.809 --> 01:24:26.008
Can you do it? It's pretty simple,
but I got to present plans in five days.

01:24:27.349 --> 01:24:28.441
Sure!

01:25:10.291 --> 01:25:12.691
This is very clever.
How did you come up with this?

01:25:12.761 --> 01:25:14.194
I just see things and put them together.

01:25:14.262 --> 01:25:15.593
- So how long will it take you to...
- And all this?

01:25:15.663 --> 01:25:17.096
That's to lead the cattle in.

01:25:17.165 --> 01:25:19.326
They're happy to follow a curve
'cause they think they're going back

01:25:19.401 --> 01:25:20.629
- to where they came from.
- Lf you say so.

01:25:20.702 --> 01:25:23.671
I do. So how long will it take you to do it?

01:25:23.738 --> 01:25:25.729
Well, I have two or three more before this.

01:25:25.807 --> 01:25:29.368
- But I need it by tomorrow!
- Everybody needs it tomorrow.

01:25:34.182 --> 01:25:35.706
I won't work any quicker with you watching.

01:25:35.784 --> 01:25:37.911
- Well, I wanna watch.
- Okay.

01:26:23.765 --> 01:26:25.096
Hey, Temple?

01:26:25.166 --> 01:26:28.158
This here is Red Harris
from <i>Cattle</i> magazine.

01:26:28.236 --> 01:26:29.601
Very nice to meet you, Mr. Harris.

01:26:29.671 --> 01:26:31.639
Yeah, Red, he can't make
the grand opening tomorrow,

01:26:31.706 --> 01:26:33.435
so I thought we'd give him a sneak preview.

01:26:33.508 --> 01:26:37.308
So, Temple, will you put some cattle
through your dip while I'm here?

01:26:37.378 --> 01:26:38.470
Okay.

01:26:39.481 --> 01:26:41.210
Hey, open the gate!

01:26:47.021 --> 01:26:51.390
So if the handlers walk slowly clockwise
outside the chute,

01:26:51.459 --> 01:26:55.088
then the cow will walk counterclockwise
through the chute.

01:26:57.365 --> 01:26:59.890
See? They'll just follow that curve.

01:27:03.104 --> 01:27:05.766
The cattle just keep calmly walking

01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:09.674
thinking they're going in circles
and following their buddies.

01:27:10.211 --> 01:27:11.974
And they're happy to follow a curve

01:27:12.046 --> 01:27:15.277
because they think they're going back
to where they came from.

01:27:16.117 --> 01:27:19.280
They're okay because it's grooved
and they know they won't slip.

01:27:19.354 --> 01:27:21.447
So when they take the next step,
their center of gravity

01:27:21.523 --> 01:27:25.254
makes them drop calmly into the dip
and they just walk through the water.

01:27:39.007 --> 01:27:41.407
I don't usually tell people
what I'm gonna write,

01:27:41.476 --> 01:27:44.445
but, Miss Grandin, this is a masterpiece.

01:27:49.918 --> 01:27:51.476
- Hey!
- I don't like to do that.

01:27:51.553 --> 01:27:53.646
I'm sorry there, Temple.

01:27:53.721 --> 01:27:55.712
Now, look, I want you to be dressed
in your best outfit

01:27:55.790 --> 01:27:57.553
tomorrow morning, okay?

01:27:58.393 --> 01:27:59.655
Okay.

01:28:13.608 --> 01:28:15.439
Just look at this thing.

01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:17.637
It'll take us forever
to get them through here.

01:28:18.012 --> 01:28:21.243
J.D., I want you to get the torch
and, Red, I want this out, this out.

01:28:21.316 --> 01:28:24.308
I want those panels lined up
and we're gonna run them straight in.

01:28:24.419 --> 01:28:26.114
Come on, boys. You two come with me.

01:28:26.321 --> 01:28:29.256
- Grab the other end of this.
- Now, hold on!

01:28:29.958 --> 01:28:33.450
Look at this! I mean, look at that!
Who'd build something like that?

01:28:34.062 --> 01:28:36.690
Jess, get me some sheet steel.
We're gonna slide these puppies in here.

01:28:36.764 --> 01:28:39.198
- Eric, where's that sheet steel?
- Hurry up!

01:28:49.477 --> 01:28:50.739
Let's go. Get up.

01:28:50.812 --> 01:28:52.439
Put them over in that pile
and get them out of here.

01:28:52.513 --> 01:28:53.741
She's here.

01:28:53.881 --> 01:28:56.975
Keep working, boys.
I'll take care of her. Pick it up.

01:28:58.486 --> 01:28:59.475
Miss.

01:29:03.458 --> 01:29:05.756
Some dip you got here.

01:29:11.332 --> 01:29:14.824
Who put steel on that slope?
Cattle can't walk on steel!

01:29:15.370 --> 01:29:17.395
That's designed so they'll walk slowly!

01:29:17.472 --> 01:29:20.600
Excuse me, little miss.
We just had three head drown in here.

01:29:20.675 --> 01:29:24.634
That's your fault!
You killed them 'cause of your stupidity!

01:29:28.483 --> 01:29:30.747
And why ain't they coming
through the curved chute?

01:29:30.818 --> 01:29:33.343
That'd take us all day, little lady!

01:29:33.955 --> 01:29:36.013
Hey, that's my shirt!

01:29:36.256 --> 01:29:38.349
If it's smooth, they'll follow it!

01:29:38.525 --> 01:29:42.518
If there's stuff on it, they'll get scared!
You can't hang things!

01:29:43.196 --> 01:29:46.063
- You wacko!
- Put it all back the way it was!

01:29:46.133 --> 01:29:48.431
Temple, what's going on here?

01:29:48.502 --> 01:29:53.906
They killed three cattle because
of their stupidity! They ruined it!

01:29:56.943 --> 01:29:58.672
Just a minute!

01:30:00.647 --> 01:30:02.342
- Cattle aren't dangerous!
- Temple?

01:30:02.416 --> 01:30:04.316
And they're predictable.
So it's not hard to design

01:30:04.384 --> 01:30:06.409
- a system that won't hurt them!
- What are you doing in California?

01:30:06.486 --> 01:30:09.455
But the cowboys would rather prod them
and scare them.

01:30:09.523 --> 01:30:11.650
- Did you drive all night?
- I designed a dip vat

01:30:11.725 --> 01:30:15.388
at John Wayne Red River Feedlot based on
the way cattle see and think and behave

01:30:15.495 --> 01:30:18.123
and the editor of <i>Cattle</i> magazine said
it was a masterpiece,

01:30:18.198 --> 01:30:20.962
but the cowboys killed three cows in it!

01:30:21.034 --> 01:30:25.528
Three. In five minutes.
Because they wouldn't follow my design!

01:30:25.672 --> 01:30:27.833
- Temple, would you like to sit down?
- I can't protect the cattle...

01:30:27.908 --> 01:30:29.034
I'm just having a cup of tea.

01:30:29.109 --> 01:30:30.508
...unless I design the whole system

01:30:30.577 --> 01:30:34.411
from the moment they enter
to the moment they get slaughtered.

01:30:34.481 --> 01:30:36.039
Are you talking about a slaughterhouse?

01:30:36.116 --> 01:30:38.209
Well, of course
they're gonna get slaughtered.

01:30:38.285 --> 01:30:41.448
Do you think we'd have cattle
if people didn't eat them every day?

01:30:41.521 --> 01:30:43.887
They'd just be
funny-looking animals in zoos.

01:30:43.957 --> 01:30:46.425
No, we raise them for us.

01:30:46.626 --> 01:30:49.288
That means we owe them some respect.

01:30:50.764 --> 01:30:54.530
Nature is cruel, but we don't have to be.

01:30:55.135 --> 01:30:58.798
I wouldn't want to have my guts
ripped out by a lion.

01:30:59.206 --> 01:31:02.505
I'd much rather die in a slaughterhouse
if it was done right!

01:31:02.576 --> 01:31:04.100
Well, it seems to me that you should be

01:31:04.177 --> 01:31:05.906
- the one who's to design...
- We can easily do it in a way

01:31:05.979 --> 01:31:09.608
where they don't feel pain
and they don't get scared.

01:31:09.683 --> 01:31:11.082
And their cortisol levels
go through the roof!

01:31:11.151 --> 01:31:13.551
Okay. Did you hear what I said, Temple?
I think you're the one

01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:15.349
- who should design the slaughterhouse.
- Yeah, I'm going...

01:31:15.422 --> 01:31:19.051
I know a slaughterhouse that's a mess
and I know exactly how to fix it.

01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:57.325
It's a door. It's another door.

01:32:05.906 --> 01:32:07.271
Can I help you?

01:32:07.340 --> 01:32:10.741
Hello, it's very nice to meet you.
I'd like to tour your slaughterhouse.

01:32:10.911 --> 01:32:12.242
Excuse me?

01:32:13.113 --> 01:32:16.571
Hello, it's very nice to meet you.
I'd like to tour your slaughterhouse.

01:32:16.650 --> 01:32:18.083
We don't do tours, ma'am.

01:32:18.151 --> 01:32:20.779
I designed a dip vat at
John Wayne's Red River Feedlot

01:32:20.854 --> 01:32:22.754
that the editor of <i>Cattle</i> magazine
said was a masterpiece...

01:32:22.823 --> 01:32:25.883
Security? Can I get security
to the front office?

01:32:51.952 --> 01:32:55.319
<i>Temple, I'm so sorry to leave this message</i>
<i>on your answering machine,</i>

01:32:55.388 --> 01:33:00.416
<i>but I thought you'd want to know</i>
<i>that your friend Dr. Carlock has died.</i>

01:33:00.961 --> 01:33:04.328
- Well, I just saw him!
- <i>Apparently, he'd been sick for some time.</i>

01:33:04.698 --> 01:33:08.225
<i>You can call me anytime. Bye, sweetheart.</i>

01:33:10.370 --> 01:33:12.167
I just saw him.

01:33:20.247 --> 01:33:21.737
What are they doing?

01:33:22.816 --> 01:33:28.277
They're paying their respects.
It's a way of saying thank you and goodbye.

01:33:28.989 --> 01:33:31.583
I said goodbye when I saw him.

01:33:31.658 --> 01:33:34.354
And this is a final chance to say goodbye.

01:34:47.334 --> 01:34:50.963
Temple. Temple. Are you all right?

01:34:51.037 --> 01:34:52.470
I'm leaving now.

01:34:53.173 --> 01:34:54.606
Well, it isn't over yet.

01:34:54.674 --> 01:34:57.643
I said goodbye when I saw him.
He's not there.

01:34:59.579 --> 01:35:02.104
I've got him in my mind.

01:35:05.218 --> 01:35:06.810
Do you know where they go?

01:35:08.555 --> 01:35:11.023
No. No, I don't.

01:35:15.261 --> 01:35:17.229
Okay. I'm gonna go now.

01:35:28.675 --> 01:35:30.336
Drive safely.

01:35:59.171 --> 01:36:01.071
There you are, ma'am.

01:36:16.388 --> 01:36:18.788
My, that's a pretty blouse.

01:36:19.792 --> 01:36:22.124
I hope you don't mind me saying so.

01:36:22.194 --> 01:36:24.560
Some people think I'm forward,
but, you know, if I like something,

01:36:24.630 --> 01:36:28.088
I just come right out
and just compliment them.

01:36:28.167 --> 01:36:30.761
It's nice to get a compliment,
don't you think?

01:36:31.704 --> 01:36:34.605
Thank you. It's very nice to meet you.
I'm Temple Grandin.

01:36:34.673 --> 01:36:37.403
Well, it's nice to meet you, too. I'm Betty.

01:36:38.977 --> 01:36:40.945
Well, then, there we are.

01:36:42.715 --> 01:36:44.683
Are you waiting to meet
somebody or something?

01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:47.810
No, I have trouble with automatic doors
sometimes when I'm nervous.

01:36:47.886 --> 01:36:49.444
I'm autistic.

01:36:51.323 --> 01:36:55.282
My son is artistic and he's got
the same thing with airplanes.

01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:58.056
Come on. You just come along with me.

01:36:59.631 --> 01:37:04.295
All right. Come on. And...
And I'll make sure that they stay open.

01:37:07.172 --> 01:37:09.766
All right? You are safe now. You're safe.

01:37:16.615 --> 01:37:19.448
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

01:37:20.853 --> 01:37:23.651
Are you a horsewoman?
I mean, you know, your shirt?

01:37:23.722 --> 01:37:26.418
Well, I like horses, but I work with cattle.

01:37:26.859 --> 01:37:30.124
I designed a dip
that <i>Cattle</i> magazine called brilliant.

01:37:30.195 --> 01:37:33.164
Oh, my golly, my husband read about you.

01:37:33.432 --> 01:37:35.332
He works over at Abbot.

01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:37.630
- Abbot slaughterhouse?
- Yeah. You heard of it?

01:37:37.703 --> 01:37:40.467
I wanna redesign it. I went there,
but they wouldn't let me meet with them.

01:37:40.539 --> 01:37:42.666
But I have several ideas
about how to make a new facility

01:37:42.741 --> 01:37:45.539
that will be much more humane
and efficient.

01:37:46.011 --> 01:37:49.208
Well, I guess you just have to meet
my husband then.

01:37:49.314 --> 01:37:52.215
How wonderful
that we bumped into each other.

01:37:54.953 --> 01:37:59.049
- A door opened and I went through it.
- Yes, you did.

01:37:59.858 --> 01:38:01.348
And I held it.

01:38:08.367 --> 01:38:10.301
This looks like an airport for cows.

01:38:10.369 --> 01:38:11.768
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:38:11.837 --> 01:38:14.965
- Thank you.
- I didn't mean that as a compliment.

01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:17.406
And conveyor belts for cattle?

01:38:18.544 --> 01:38:21.604
Do you have any idea
what the cost is on this?

01:38:22.247 --> 01:38:25.341
And you've got solid walls and floors.

01:38:25.984 --> 01:38:29.579
We have those slatted for a reason.
It's cheaper.

01:38:29.655 --> 01:38:32.556
I'm sorry, Miss Grandin.
It's clear you just don't have the experience

01:38:32.624 --> 01:38:33.921
to design something like this.

01:38:33.992 --> 01:38:38.656
The walls are solid so the cattle won't be
distracted by light or movement outside.

01:38:38.730 --> 01:38:42.029
- They balk at unexpected things.
- I'm sure that's nice for the cattle,

01:38:42.100 --> 01:38:44.534
- but the cost, Miss...
- How much money does it cost you

01:38:44.603 --> 01:38:46.935
to pay handlers to prod the cattle along

01:38:47.005 --> 01:38:49.530
and then hold them back
when they stampede?

01:38:49.608 --> 01:38:53.408
How many times a day do your chutes stop
because of pile-ups?

01:38:53.478 --> 01:38:56.970
How many cows break a leg
and bring everything to a halt?

01:38:57.049 --> 01:39:02.077
With my system, there'd be none of that.
There'd be a steady, calm flow.

01:39:02.888 --> 01:39:06.449
Well, that sounds great, but you don't have
any idea of whether it'll work or not.

01:39:06.525 --> 01:39:09.653
But I do.
I'm like Nikola Tesla or Thomas Edison.

01:39:09.728 --> 01:39:12.094
I know my system will work
'cause I've been through it

01:39:12.164 --> 01:39:13.995
a thousand times in my head.

01:39:14.066 --> 01:39:16.125
I can see a chute just as the cattle will

01:39:16.201 --> 01:39:18.601
because that's something
my autism lets me do.

01:39:18.670 --> 01:39:24.199
I can walk through a plan in my mind,
examining every beam and every rivet.

01:39:24.276 --> 01:39:28.542
I mean, you just see a plan,
but I'm walking through the whole plant.

01:39:29.748 --> 01:39:33.411
Okay, the cattle go through
a series of solid curves.

01:39:33.485 --> 01:39:36.079
And the floor is solid, too, grooved.

01:39:36.922 --> 01:39:39.015
The chute gets smaller,
but the cattle won't mind.

01:39:39.091 --> 01:39:40.649
They don't... They don't see any danger.

01:39:40.726 --> 01:39:43.593
They think
they're just getting into another truck.

01:39:43.662 --> 01:39:46.324
<i>The stairway leads them gently upwards.</i>

01:39:46.465 --> 01:39:48.797
<i>The floor becomes a conveyor.</i>

01:39:49.401 --> 01:39:54.100
<i>A rest rises up to meet their chest</i>
<i>so they're comfortably carried.</i>

01:39:55.474 --> 01:39:57.806
They'll be very calm.

01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:12.381
<i>Nature is cruel, but we don't have to be.</i>

01:40:13.292 --> 01:40:15.283
<i>We owe them some respect.</i>

01:40:19.031 --> 01:40:22.023
<i>I touched the first cow</i>
<i>as it was being stunned.</i>

01:40:22.801 --> 01:40:25.065
<i>In a few seconds, it was gonna be</i>
<i>just another piece of beef,</i>

01:40:25.137 --> 01:40:28.368
<i>but in that moment,</i>
<i>it was still an individual.</i>

01:40:29.541 --> 01:40:31.008
<i>It was calm.</i>

01:40:34.179 --> 01:40:35.669
<i>And then it was gone.</i>

01:40:37.482 --> 01:40:40.383
<i>I became aware of how precious life was.</i>

01:40:41.219 --> 01:40:44.711
<i>And I thought about death</i>
<i>and I felt close to God.</i>

01:40:48.727 --> 01:40:51.161
I don't want my thoughts to die with me.

01:40:51.530 --> 01:40:53.395
I want to have done something.

01:40:55.534 --> 01:40:57.434
Thank you for inviting me.

01:40:58.303 --> 01:41:01.170
You're the one person I wanted here.

01:41:01.239 --> 01:41:04.208
Other people would have been overwhelmed
by what they were seeing.

01:41:04.276 --> 01:41:05.573
It would have confused them.

01:41:05.644 --> 01:41:09.080
I knew that you would be the only one
able to sense what was really going on,

01:41:09.147 --> 01:41:11.945
who could feel
what I was trying to accomplish.

01:41:12.451 --> 01:41:14.385
I know there are a lot of things
I can't understand,

01:41:14.453 --> 01:41:17.616
but I still want my life to have meaning.

01:41:26.498 --> 01:41:29.763
I don't know that I want to hear
from any more experts.

01:41:30.802 --> 01:41:33.464
- That doesn't work!
- We've been trying those things for years!

01:41:33.538 --> 01:41:35.165
<i>Will you please let me finish?</i>

01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:38.334
<i>With intensive psychotherapy,</i>
<i>an autistic child can be treated...</i>

01:41:38.443 --> 01:41:41.810
But the Rimland report plainly shows that
autism is not a psychological problem.

01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:44.178
- <i>I am not familiar with the Rimland report.</i>
- Calm down. Calm down.

01:41:44.249 --> 01:41:46.114
Calm down, sweetie. Sweetie, calm down.
Calm down.

01:41:46.184 --> 01:41:48.379
<i>It would be better</i>
<i>if you could get her to sit calmly.</i>

01:41:48.453 --> 01:41:50.387
- <i>You know, try to control her.</i>
- <i>What are you talking about?</i>

01:41:50.455 --> 01:41:53.447
<i>But we were told self-stimming is good.</i>
<i>It eventually calms them.</i>

01:41:53.525 --> 01:41:55.322
<i>Self-stimming is self- comforting.</i>

01:41:55.394 --> 01:41:58.921
Self-stimulation, rocking, spinning,
rolling on the floor, flapping the...

01:41:58.997 --> 01:42:01.090
Well, I think spinning is good.

01:42:01.266 --> 01:42:03.097
And rolling, too.

01:42:03.168 --> 01:42:07.103
Self-stimulation does seem to eventually
calm the nervous system.

01:42:07.171 --> 01:42:10.334
It can be a way to compensate
for not being held.

01:42:10.408 --> 01:42:12.638
And being held by another person is scary,

01:42:12.710 --> 01:42:16.441
but rolling or,
or being held by surfaces produces

01:42:16.514 --> 01:42:19.449
the calming effect
that ordinary children get from a hug.

01:42:19.517 --> 01:42:20.950
How old is your child?

01:42:22.586 --> 01:42:24.577
Well, I don't have children.

01:42:25.790 --> 01:42:27.553
No, I'm autistic.

01:42:28.259 --> 01:42:31.160
And I need the sensation of being hugged.

01:42:31.695 --> 01:42:34.687
And I've developed a machine
that I get into and hugs me

01:42:34.765 --> 01:42:37.791
and I'm different afterwards.
I'm more social.

01:42:38.335 --> 01:42:40.769
Well, I didn't speak until I was four

01:42:40.838 --> 01:42:45.070
and now I have a B.A. And a master's
and I'm studying for my doctorate.

01:42:45.309 --> 01:42:48.073
- How did you learn to speak?
- How's it possible?

01:42:48.145 --> 01:42:50.511
Please don't shout. Please don't...

01:42:50.581 --> 01:42:55.450
Most autistic people are very sensitive
to sounds and colors.

01:42:56.921 --> 01:42:59.515
Over-stimulation hurts.

01:43:00.891 --> 01:43:02.950
You know,
people talking too much at once,

01:43:03.027 --> 01:43:04.756
you know, can cause us to panic.

01:43:04.829 --> 01:43:06.820
How did you get cured?

01:43:07.465 --> 01:43:10.901
Well, I'm not cured. I'll always be autistic.

01:43:11.469 --> 01:43:15.405
My mother refused to believe
that I wouldn't speak.

01:43:15.539 --> 01:43:18.940
And when I learned to speak,
she made me go to school.

01:43:19.543 --> 01:43:24.708
And in school and at home,
manners and rules were really important.

01:43:24.882 --> 01:43:28.181
They were pounded into me. I was lucky.

01:43:28.252 --> 01:43:30.345
All these things worked for me.

01:43:30.421 --> 01:43:33.584
Everyone worked hard
to make sure that I was engaged.

01:43:33.657 --> 01:43:36.785
I mean, they knew I was different,
but not less.

01:43:37.128 --> 01:43:38.618
You know, I had a gift.

01:43:38.696 --> 01:43:40.391
I could see the world in a new way.

01:43:40.464 --> 01:43:43.922
I could see details
that other people were blind to.

01:43:45.369 --> 01:43:48.930
My mother pushed me
to become self-sufficient.

01:43:49.006 --> 01:43:51.736
I worked summers at my aunt's ranch.

01:43:51.809 --> 01:43:55.745
I went to boarding school and college
and those things...

01:43:55.813 --> 01:43:57.781
Those things
were uncomfortable for me at first,

01:43:57.848 --> 01:44:00.840
but they helped me
to open doors to new worlds.

01:44:00.918 --> 01:44:04.547
Excuse me, please,
but we want to hear everything.

01:44:04.622 --> 01:44:07.147
- Yes. Please.
- Yes. Please tell us.

01:44:07.224 --> 01:44:09.886
- Please, everything you can tell us.
- Yes. Tell us, please.

01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:31.240
<i>Are you a scientist?</i>

01:44:31.315 --> 01:44:32.373
- <i>French fish!</i>
- <i>French fish!</i>

01:44:32.449 --> 01:44:34.440
- <i>You cannot hit people.</i>
- <i>You think you can figure it out?</i>

01:44:34.518 --> 01:44:39.217
- <i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i>
- <i>I have a pen and a clipboard.</i>

01:44:39.290 --> 01:44:41.121
<i>Think of it as a door.</i>

01:44:41.192 --> 01:44:45.151
- <i>It just takes one knock to the head.</i>
- <i>I don't understand why people are cruel</i>

01:44:45.229 --> 01:44:47.925
- <i>for no reason!</i>
- <i>You have a very special mind.</i>

01:44:47.998 --> 01:44:50.023
<i>You see the world in ways that others can't.</i>

01:44:50.100 --> 01:44:52.330
<i>Miss Grandin, this is a masterpiece.</i>

01:44:52.403 --> 01:44:56.567
- <i>A door opened and I went through it.</i>
- <i>Yes, you</i> did.

01:44:56.640 --> 01:44:58.130
<i>And I held it.</i>

01:45:02.379 --> 01:45:04.370
I'm Temple Grandin.
