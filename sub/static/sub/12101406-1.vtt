Do you know what that means?

19:20.960 --> 19:23.520
Uh, yes. We go back to the tribe?

19:23.720 --> 19:25.757
no! (LAUGHS)

19:25.960 --> 19:28.953
That means I can talk to Little Thunder!

19:29.160 --> 19:32.312
Hey! This is not the way to the village!

19:34.840 --> 19:39.278
The trail of Little Thunder ends here on this stone path.

19:39.520 --> 19:41.671
He certainly ran into the forest.

19:41.880 --> 19:45.396
You don't want to go in there! There are wild beasts in the forest!

19:45.640 --> 19:47.199
I have to talk to him!

19:47.400 --> 19:51.440
You can be dogish, but maybe not a horse!

19:52.840 --> 19:54.593
YAKARI: There are no traces here.

19:54.800 --> 19:57.554
I can ask the other forest dwellers.

19:57.880 --> 20:01.112
Then we see if other animals understand me.

20:01.320 --> 20:04.279
Other animals? Do you mean the beasts?

20:06.560 --> 20:07.550
Yakari?

20:12.080 --> 20:14.231
Hello? Yakari?

20:14.440 --> 20:15.840
shh!

20:18.360 --> 20:21.194
Never do anything like this to me again! - Schh!

20:26.440 --> 20:27.669
huh?

20:28.000 --> 20:31.038
Beep, beep, do you see the little man?

20:31.240 --> 20:32.879
What does he do alone in the forest?

20:33.080 --> 20:36.676
And this dog doesn't look like he can protect him!

20:36.880 --> 20:38.997
Hey birds! I can understand you.

20:39.200 --> 20:40.316
what?

20:40.560 --> 20:43.359
Did you happen to see a pony that...?

20:44.520 --> 20:47.240
Hey, hey, that starts really well.

oh! Hello, Owl!

21:16.680 --> 21:18.273
ah!

21:24.600 --> 21:26.592
I'm sorry.

21:27.560 --> 21:29.597
So you understand me.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.632
Did a pony come by here?

21:31.840 --> 21:35.550
You can't just sneak in and get rid of it!

21:35.760 --> 21:37.240
Bla, blah, blah!

21:37.440 --> 21:40.114
moment! You speak my language!

21:40.320 --> 21:41.549
Mhm.

21:42.440 --> 21:43.556
I am Yakari.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.353
And I am speechless!

21:45.600 --> 21:47.876
How rude to scare me so much!

21:48.080 --> 21:51.073
Oh yes, your pony is long!

21:51.280 --> 21:54.717
oh. Thank you, Owl! And apologize.

22:04.680 --> 22:06.672
Oah!

22:10.320 --> 22:13.836
Hey, little butterfly, you understand me too, don't you?

22:14.040 --> 22:15.235
yes.

22:15.440 --> 22:17.955
Have you seen a pony here?

Now I understand. That's where he ran!

22:41.040 --> 22:43.111
Thank you, butterflies!

22:44.000 --> 22:45.116
You're welcome...

22:45.320 --> 22:48.358
Please don't say you want to talk to the ants.

22:48.600 --> 22:50.432
(LAUGHS) Well come!

22:50.680 --> 22:53.240
My father showed me how to read tracks.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.079
This is of Little Thunder.

22:56.680 --> 23:00.356
Now it's enough with this pony! We have to go home!

23:01.000 --> 23:05.836
But I don't want to. Thanks to Großer Adler's gift, I can now talk to him!

23:06.680 --> 23:09.070
Surely we will be friends!

23:10.120 --> 23:12.316
You already have a friend!

23:12.840 --> 23:15.560
I know that, Knickohr. Let's go, come on!

24:08.960 --> 24:11.191
Now I can talk to all the animals!

24:11.400 --> 24:13.119
I think Little Thunder...

24:14.240 --> 24:16.038
What is "Little Thunder"?

24:17.560 --> 24:18.960
That's you!

24:19.160 --> 24:22.597
The name was given to you by my tribe, the Sioux:

24:22.800 --> 24:26.714
Little thunder, the pony that's as fast as the lightning!

24:27.080 --> 24:29.197
What are they doing?

24:30.880 --> 24:34.271

24:35.680 --> 24:37.194
No, it's going to happen again.

I sent Knickohr, but it's gone.

All my fault. I wanted to follow the hunters.

real? We can't leave without Yakari!

01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:48.517
Yes, Yakari!

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:08.273
(KCHERT)

01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:12.958
Shimmering braids and bold looks can be proud of their son.

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:17.833
He has asserted himself all alone in the wilderness.

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:24.716
And Yakari came back to us on the back of the wildest wild horse.

01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:38.269
You deserve this eagle feather as a symbol of your great courage.

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:39.397
oh!

01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:42.792
The feather that Big Eagle gave me!

01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:52.874
Well done, my son.

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:54.594
We are proud of you!

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:56.359
That was strong!

01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:58.239
(CHEERING AND LAUGHING)

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:13.637
(WIEHERT)

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:30.439
(GESANG) Yakari!

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:34.230
Yakari

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:38.036
and his best friend.

01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:41.358
Children of the prairie,

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:45.230
what a child only dreams of.

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:49.351
Big Eagle

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:52.798
watches over him.

01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:56.712
His friends are the animals,

01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:00.391
the wind and the river.

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:04.796
Yakari

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.232
and his best friend.

01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:11.878
Children of the prairie,

01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:15.951
what a child only dreams of.

01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:19.592
Yakari,

01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:27.318
Yakari.
