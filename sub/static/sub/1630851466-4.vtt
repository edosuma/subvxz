00:13.170 --> 00:15.210
(Episode 4)

00:23.720 --> 00:26.689
Do you want me to tell you
what I did with them?

00:26.820 --> 00:30.690
I used my own hands
to slit open their necks.

00:31.359 --> 00:34.390
Dong Wook and Kyung Seok
were killed with a gun, not a knife.

00:34.960 --> 00:38.129
They had a mastermind
who controlled them from behind.

00:38.660 --> 00:40.199
Is that Baek Mo Sa?

00:42.469 --> 00:43.739
Baek Mo Sa.

00:44.670 --> 00:49.009
You asked me why I didn't
contact the NIS after that incident.

00:50.210 --> 00:53.710
I called the number you gave me.

00:55.009 --> 00:59.490
But a group of other people
showed up at the rendezvous point.

01:02.190 --> 01:05.430
They had come to kill me.

01:14.640 --> 01:17.080
My gosh. You're really tense.

01:17.450 --> 01:19.550
Relax, will you?

01:19.619 --> 01:21.489
Here's what you asked me
to look into.

01:24.090 --> 01:25.920
(Personnel File)

01:26.920 --> 01:28.306
Shin Sang Hoon
is with General Affairs.

01:28.330 --> 01:31.529
He served with the UDU,
the Navy Intelligence Unit,

01:31.530 --> 01:33.020
and was a special hire.

01:33.021 --> 01:34.569
Is there anything else?

01:34.570 --> 01:36.338
There was one interesting fact.

01:36.339 --> 01:39.380
Do you know who was in charge
of the project he was hired for?

01:40.879 --> 01:42.119
Chief Ha Dong Kyun.

01:43.220 --> 01:45.419
I think there's a connection
between the two,

01:45.420 --> 01:47.649
but however hard I look,
I can't find anything else.

01:49.259 --> 01:51.158
And what's going on with Chief Ha?

01:51.159 --> 01:53.128
What were you to scheming?

01:53.129 --> 01:54.230
Did you really...

01:54.929 --> 01:57.360
forget everything
from the past year?

02:05.970 --> 02:07.639
Do me another favor.

02:07.970 --> 02:09.309
What is it?

02:09.310 --> 02:10.908
Check the operating room server.

02:10.910 --> 02:12.208
Last year in mid-March,

02:12.209 --> 02:14.310
there was an incoming emergency call
from Dandong.

02:15.380 --> 02:18.048
Find out who the last person
to receive the report on it was.

02:18.049 --> 02:19.918
That's not hard at all.

02:19.919 --> 02:21.988
It's urgent. Make it quick.

02:21.989 --> 02:25.060
I will. I'll call you
as soon as I find out.

02:25.359 --> 02:26.690
I said it's urgent.

02:29.730 --> 02:31.959
I thought we could eat together.

02:36.369 --> 02:41.240
(The Late Choi Il Lak)

02:52.819 --> 02:57.860
(The Late Choi Il Lak)

02:57.990 --> 02:58.990
(NFS)

03:00.890 --> 03:02.859
(One year ago)

03:02.860 --> 03:06.270
(Forensics)

03:09.439 --> 03:10.800
Search thoroughly.

03:11.300 --> 03:13.839
Take your time and circle.

03:14.170 --> 03:16.779
Take your time and circle.

03:18.210 --> 03:19.908
Keep going.

03:19.909 --> 03:22.950
Bring it further this way.

03:28.290 --> 03:31.589
(My son)

03:48.409 --> 03:50.620
You look worse than before.

03:51.849 --> 03:53.550
Do you eat regularly?

03:54.849 --> 03:57.560
- Yes.
- I was at your place last week.

03:57.889 --> 04:01.529
You didn't let me in
when you were at home, right?

04:03.759 --> 04:05.470
You can stop this now.

04:06.370 --> 04:08.470
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

04:11.970 --> 04:13.499
I have enought money.

04:13.839 --> 04:15.848
I was compensated for Dad's death.

04:15.849 --> 04:18.449
Sang Kyun. I want you to...

04:18.450 --> 04:20.320
Don't you think so too?

04:21.789 --> 04:23.820
That my dad killed himself.

04:27.190 --> 04:28.529
That's...

04:29.990 --> 04:32.259
not something
you can decide on so easily.

04:32.269 --> 04:35.440
Last night, I dreamed of him again.

04:36.469 --> 04:38.239
He stood by my bed...

04:38.240 --> 04:40.979
and looked down at me silently,
then walked away.

04:43.610 --> 04:46.180
I tried to call out to him,
but I couldn't make a sound.

04:48.519 --> 04:51.819
Even in my dream,
I couldn't do a thing.

04:51.999 --> 04:53.300
I do know...

04:54.699 --> 04:56.039
how that feels.

04:56.040 --> 04:57.869
How would you know?

04:59.110 --> 05:00.970
You haven't been through it.

05:01.210 --> 05:03.508
Sang Kyun. I'm...

05:03.509 --> 05:05.980
I shouldn't have
believed you at all.

05:06.449 --> 05:09.079
It has been a year
and nothing has changed.

05:11.819 --> 05:13.689
What will you do about my poor dad?

05:17.020 --> 05:19.729
I can't leave him
like this anymore. Now...

05:22.159 --> 05:24.099
I will do something about it.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.229
Sang Kyun.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.370
Sang Kyun.

05:42.150 --> 05:43.520
Oh, I forgot.

06:26.489 --> 06:27.489
(NIS)

06:37.739 --> 06:38.769
What's this?

06:38.770 --> 06:41.340
It's an agent's laptop
assigned to Technical Development.

06:41.610 --> 06:43.238
It's connected to the network,

06:43.239 --> 06:44.840
but there's no movement yet.

06:46.040 --> 06:47.280
Track the IP address.

06:58.360 --> 07:00.029
Check the operating room server.

07:00.030 --> 07:01.628
Last year in mid-March, there was...

07:01.629 --> 07:04.170
an incoming emergency call
from Dandong.

07:04.470 --> 07:07.100
Find out who the last person
to receive the report on it was.

07:14.239 --> 07:16.080
Gosh, he's impatient.

07:17.109 --> 07:18.709
I'm checking right now.

07:18.710 --> 07:20.580
Wait while I get what you need.

07:36.129 --> 07:39.129
What's this? This can't be.

07:39.570 --> 07:41.539
What is it? What's wrong?

07:42.770 --> 07:44.710
There's no record of it.

07:46.210 --> 07:47.239
What?

07:49.179 --> 07:51.010
I think it's a cafe
on Sillim Junction.

07:52.850 --> 07:53.919
Move.

08:00.759 --> 08:03.659
It's the back door.
He's in the system already.

08:10.430 --> 08:12.470
Files are leaving the main server.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.570
Lock it. Close down the server.

08:25.680 --> 08:26.680
What's going on?

08:27.550 --> 08:29.279
What do you mean there's no record?

08:30.050 --> 08:32.450
It doesn't say who took the call.

08:32.519 --> 08:34.518
The data was deleted.

08:34.519 --> 08:36.119
Just the call you talked about.

08:39.059 --> 08:40.960
Shoot, I think something's wrong.

08:41.059 --> 08:42.259
I'll call you back.

09:02.350 --> 09:06.220
How could someone
get through our firewall so easily?

09:06.930 --> 09:09.659
The person came in
through a back door they'd planted.

09:09.660 --> 09:11.258
There was nothing we could do.

09:11.259 --> 09:12.929
- A "back door"?
- Yes.

09:12.930 --> 09:16.039
To put it simply,
someone created a back door in advance...

09:16.040 --> 09:18.410
to gain easier access to our server.

09:19.410 --> 09:21.410
Are you saying
an insider was involved?

09:23.209 --> 09:24.239
Yes.

09:24.739 --> 09:28.479
They used an agent's laptop
that was approved by the agency.

09:29.020 --> 09:30.920
It's clear an insider was involved.

09:31.820 --> 09:34.149
Then you just have to find out
whose laptop was used.

09:34.150 --> 09:36.789
We're looking into that right now
and will get the result shortly.

09:36.790 --> 09:38.289
What files were leaked?

09:38.290 --> 09:40.659
We need to check to get the details,

09:40.660 --> 09:42.728
but they targeted top-secret intel...

09:42.729 --> 09:44.459
assigned one year ago.

09:44.560 --> 09:47.369
The hacker had complete knowledge
of our server directory,

09:48.270 --> 09:51.569
(List of Hacks and Confirmed Loss)

09:51.570 --> 09:52.709
Excuse me.

09:53.740 --> 09:54.740
Yes, what is it?

09:57.380 --> 09:58.550
Okay, I got it.

09:59.280 --> 10:00.280
What is it?

10:01.380 --> 10:03.650
We found out who's laptop it is.

10:04.790 --> 10:05.790
Whose is it?

10:05.959 --> 10:06.989
Well, it's...

10:07.959 --> 10:09.530
Director Choi Il Lak's.

10:11.630 --> 10:12.730
Who's that?

10:16.570 --> 10:17.729
Who is it?

10:20.940 --> 10:22.440
He worked at Technical Development.

10:23.209 --> 10:25.140
He was in charge
of the MPK program.

10:37.390 --> 10:39.520
How can a specific part be erased?

10:39.920 --> 10:43.728
Someone got in the operating room
and erased the record.

10:43.729 --> 10:45.099
That's the only way.

10:45.259 --> 10:46.699
Can you find out who?

10:46.700 --> 10:48.399
I tried to find out.

10:48.400 --> 10:51.200
But our server went down
since yesterday's hacking incident.

10:52.739 --> 10:55.070
- Hacking incident?
- You haven't heard?

10:55.709 --> 10:57.485
Someone hacked
into our main server yesterday.

10:57.509 --> 11:00.079
I heard only top-secret intel
from a year ago was taken.

11:06.579 --> 11:08.290
Was any of it...

11:08.890 --> 11:10.989
from Foreign Intelligence...

11:11.619 --> 11:13.719
gathered while I was missing
a year ago included?

11:13.920 --> 11:15.189
I don't know.

11:15.190 --> 11:18.629
Anyway, everyone's under inspection
because of the incident.

11:19.060 --> 11:22.270
We should lay low
and don't contact each other for a while.

11:23.129 --> 11:25.369
I'm getting another call.
I should get going.

11:48.589 --> 11:50.259
You do know
Director Choi Il Lak, right?

11:54.829 --> 11:57.698
What? You worked with him before,
didn't you?

11:57.699 --> 11:59.900
Yes, ma'am. But why do you ask?

12:00.400 --> 12:03.439
They found out the laptop
used to hack our server was his.

12:04.069 --> 12:06.709
And the hacker targeted
the intel from a year ago.

12:07.650 --> 12:09.750
Do you know what this means?

12:12.319 --> 12:14.750
Do you think
that's what the hacker wanted?

12:16.050 --> 12:19.290
I'm sure the hacker wanted the file
for the civilian inspection case.

12:20.859 --> 12:22.790
In order to cover that up,

12:24.300 --> 12:26.229
we had to pay a great price.

12:27.569 --> 12:29.569
If Deputy Commissioner Do
gets the information,

12:30.229 --> 12:31.669
you do know what will happen, right?

12:32.569 --> 12:33.639
No need to worry.

12:33.640 --> 12:36.568
We will fully mobilize information
from branches all over the country.

12:36.569 --> 12:37.979
But it's not like...

12:38.609 --> 12:40.679
we're the only one
who's being chased.

12:40.880 --> 12:44.550
I'm sure she's being
torn by anxiety too.

12:45.150 --> 12:46.150
What do you mean?

12:46.420 --> 12:49.689
Do you think it only includes data
that'll be used against us?

12:50.050 --> 12:51.619
The civilian inspection case is
the Achilles' heel...

12:51.620 --> 12:52.689
of Domestic Intelligence.

12:52.959 --> 12:56.129
If we can secure the data,
we can take the initiative.

12:56.130 --> 12:57.629
The situation isn't exactly
going in our favor.

12:57.630 --> 12:59.859
If things go wrong,
it could backfire.

13:00.030 --> 13:01.699
The leaked intel includes...

13:02.270 --> 13:04.870
the information
we can never let them have.

13:08.640 --> 13:10.770
It'll end only when one of us fails.

13:13.109 --> 13:14.949
That means we have to secure
the intel first...

13:15.949 --> 13:17.280
no matter what.

13:17.479 --> 13:18.679
So I was thinking...

13:19.780 --> 13:22.819
perhaps you won't have to step up
to the plate for this.

13:23.150 --> 13:24.659
I don't understand.

13:24.660 --> 13:27.420
You can work behind the scenes
to support us.

13:27.559 --> 13:29.059
Then who's going to be in charge?

13:29.630 --> 13:31.729
Someone who's not related...

13:32.660 --> 13:34.429
to the civilian inspection case.

13:34.770 --> 13:36.370
That way, if things go wrong,

13:37.229 --> 13:39.445
we can get rid of the person
in charge without any trouble.

13:39.469 --> 13:41.140
Do we even have anyone for the job?

13:42.709 --> 13:43.740
Come in.

13:48.449 --> 13:49.510
Did you want to see me?

13:50.479 --> 13:51.479
Yes, I did.

14:05.289 --> 14:07.950
Can I get an extension number?

14:08.350 --> 14:10.259
Who are you looking for?

14:10.360 --> 14:12.230
I'll find the number for you.

14:13.800 --> 14:15.630
Director Choi Il Lak
at Technical Development.

14:19.469 --> 14:20.469
What is it?

14:20.870 --> 14:22.240
Do you know...

14:24.270 --> 14:25.839
Director Choi?

14:26.270 --> 14:27.479
Why? What's going on?

14:28.339 --> 14:29.679
Did something happen to him?

14:33.209 --> 14:34.349
Director Choi...

14:35.920 --> 14:36.949
died...

14:38.150 --> 14:39.150
a year ago.

14:41.790 --> 14:42.959
Director Choi...

14:44.530 --> 14:46.729
committed suicide.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.040
Ms. Yoo Je Yi?

15:12.869 --> 15:14.108
Yes, that's me.

15:14.109 --> 15:15.609
We're from the inspection office.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.139
Please come with us.

15:17.479 --> 15:18.550
Me?

15:24.249 --> 15:26.689
Were you aware that Choi Sang Kyun
has been engaging in...

15:26.690 --> 15:28.059
hacking activities?

15:28.060 --> 15:29.290
Tell us everything you know.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.610
(NIS employee Mr. Choi's
suicide note was released.)

15:50.820 --> 15:51.879
Sir.

15:57.220 --> 16:01.460
Technical Development came up
with a hacking program called MPK.

16:01.730 --> 16:05.058
A press release said the NIS used
the program to investigate civilians,

16:05.059 --> 16:06.430
and it had stirred up controversy.

16:07.670 --> 16:11.900
He wasn't taking any sleeping pills.

16:12.240 --> 16:15.539
But he got a high dose of sleeping pills
without a prescription.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.880
So many things seem fishy.

16:18.839 --> 16:21.380
How do you know
so much about the case?

16:21.609 --> 16:24.180
I was pretty close to Director Choi.

16:24.819 --> 16:26.549
He was my mentor
when I first got the job.

16:27.950 --> 16:32.159
How do you know Director Choi?

16:32.160 --> 16:34.859
We worked on the same project
a few years ago.

16:39.460 --> 16:40.598
Sir.

16:40.599 --> 16:43.740
I think Sang Kyun had something
to do with the incident.

16:44.799 --> 16:47.769
Help me find Sang Kyun.

16:48.139 --> 16:50.480
It's been a while,
but he was your colleague.

16:55.290 --> 16:56.690
Thank you, reporter.

16:57.760 --> 16:59.260
I'll see you there tomorrow.

17:01.300 --> 17:05.329
(Reporter Jang Ho Sung)

17:05.569 --> 17:07.449
(Unknown Caller
Would you like to work with me?)

17:09.200 --> 17:11.079
(Unknown Caller
Would you like to work with me?)

17:12.780 --> 17:14.579
(Who are you?)

17:17.210 --> 17:18.250
(Someone like you.)

17:19.848 --> 17:21.020
(Someone who wants revenge.)

17:26.520 --> 17:27.990
(Do you want true vengeance?)

17:32.230 --> 17:33.260
(Slide to shutdown)

17:40.399 --> 17:41.869
(Do you have it with you?)

17:57.419 --> 17:59.220
- What are you doing? Get in.
- Yes, sir.

18:01.720 --> 18:02.790
Sang Kyun.

18:12.669 --> 18:14.200
Sang Kyun, it's me.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.050
I don't think he's home.

18:26.450 --> 18:28.519
I heard he had some
trouble adjusting to school.

18:28.520 --> 18:31.089
So Director Choi homeschooled him.

18:31.619 --> 18:33.960
That's when he learned
coding and programming.

18:34.819 --> 18:38.190
Come to think of it,
he seemed gifted that way.

18:39.530 --> 18:41.328
He was on a famous hacking team
in middle school.

18:41.329 --> 18:42.659
Everyone said he was a genius.

18:42.760 --> 18:45.069
Try to find something
that could give us a clue.

18:45.770 --> 18:46.839
Yes, sir.

18:59.279 --> 19:00.679
(Daekook Ilbo
Reporter Jang Ho Sung)

19:04.789 --> 19:06.190
(Daekook Ilbo
Reporter Jang Ho Sung)

19:09.783 --> 19:10.783
Sir.

19:11.899 --> 19:13.779
It's the reporter Sang Kyun
is following on SNS.

19:15.510 --> 19:16.608
(Reporter Jang Ho Sung)

19:16.609 --> 19:17.908
I know what he's trying to do.

19:17.909 --> 19:21.909
He wants to give
the intel to the press.

19:23.580 --> 19:25.780
(Reporter Jang Ho Sung)

19:48.139 --> 19:50.679
You must be Sang Kyun.

19:52.540 --> 19:56.350
Did you bring the data
we talked about on the phone?

19:57.250 --> 19:58.419
Is that...

19:59.280 --> 20:00.619
what you want to know?

20:02.959 --> 20:05.119
I wanted to talk
about my father's incident first.

20:06.629 --> 20:07.689
Okay.

20:08.659 --> 20:10.230
Let's do that.

20:13.230 --> 20:16.899
Then what should we
talk about first?

20:23.480 --> 20:25.879
Sang Kyun!

20:28.350 --> 20:30.320
Hey! Sang Kyun! Stop right there!

20:38.859 --> 20:39.859
Stop.

20:52.070 --> 20:53.340
Darn it.

21:10.889 --> 21:12.159
Choi Sang Kyun!

21:26.240 --> 21:27.369
Hey, Sang Kyun.

22:17.319 --> 22:19.129
(Han Ji Hyuk)

22:21.629 --> 22:23.329
Yes. I'm on my way out.

22:23.659 --> 22:26.629
No. Don't.
Another team just got here.

22:27.169 --> 22:29.040
They just entered
through the front door.

22:29.470 --> 22:31.809
Let's meet up
in the basement parking lot.

23:08.339 --> 23:09.540
Hurry!

23:17.450 --> 23:19.720
What's wrong? What is it?

23:21.159 --> 23:22.918
You're Han Ji Hyuk, right?

23:22.919 --> 23:24.089
Do you know me?

23:25.829 --> 23:27.290
How do you know my name?

23:27.490 --> 23:28.859
Don't you remember?

23:29.430 --> 23:31.000
What you promised me that day?

23:31.169 --> 23:33.899
What I promised?
What did I promise you?

23:33.970 --> 23:36.200
- I made a promise to you?
- Yes.

23:37.470 --> 23:39.139
You said so yourself...

23:39.309 --> 23:41.069
about a year ago in Shenyang.

23:45.780 --> 23:47.109
Liar.

23:48.720 --> 23:51.149
You promised to protect my father.

24:00.029 --> 24:03.730
(Please find out
who got the last call from my team.)

24:27.819 --> 24:29.979
You'll wish you didn't lose him
when I'm done with you!

24:50.240 --> 24:51.579
Don't you remember?

24:52.910 --> 24:54.349
What you promised me that day?

24:54.950 --> 24:56.519
You said so yourself...

24:56.720 --> 24:58.450
about a year ago in Shenyang.

25:01.359 --> 25:02.559
What's your deal?

25:06.359 --> 25:08.859
Why did you get involved
and mess up this operation?

25:09.200 --> 25:10.630
Have you forgotten already?

25:11.869 --> 25:14.970
The pain you caused
to people around you?

25:15.240 --> 25:16.539
It was all because of you.

25:17.569 --> 25:20.009
If Director Choi's legs weren't
injured like that,

25:20.339 --> 25:22.779
he wouldn't have ended up
in Technical Development.

25:22.910 --> 25:26.480
And if he never ended up there,
this would have never happened.

25:27.819 --> 25:29.680
When you heard it was his son,

25:30.180 --> 25:32.390
did you suddenly get
a sense of sympathy for the kid?

25:32.619 --> 25:35.920
Are you trying to feel less guilty
about what you did now?

25:37.160 --> 25:38.730
Then what is your deal?

25:42.329 --> 25:45.099
I doubt that you're doing this
out of sympathy.

25:45.329 --> 25:47.900
Why are you running an operation
just to catch a kid?

25:50.400 --> 25:51.869
You can't answer that?

25:52.170 --> 25:54.309
Are you just following orders?

25:55.079 --> 25:57.980
Shut your mouth.
Why do you think I'm in this...

26:01.849 --> 26:03.480
Let me remind you.

26:04.750 --> 26:06.990
You'd better stay out of this.

26:07.789 --> 26:10.259
Next time, I won't be so nice
to let you off with a warning.

26:24.039 --> 26:27.170
So there was an incident
at a shopping mall in Yeouido.

26:28.880 --> 26:31.349
Tell me how it happened.

26:32.279 --> 26:34.480
Why must I explain that to you?

26:34.819 --> 26:36.379
Well, the shopping mall...

26:36.380 --> 26:38.890
was the location we set up
in advance.

26:39.589 --> 26:42.319
And your team got involved
rather aggressively.

26:44.589 --> 26:47.299
When did we ever set a rule
for who goes first?

26:48.660 --> 26:50.459
Come on, Ms. Do.

26:50.460 --> 26:51.999
I talked to the people
from the shopping mall.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.939
They suspect that someone hacked
in through the internal network...

26:53.940 --> 26:55.369
and shut down...

26:55.839 --> 26:57.609
the power transmission system.

26:57.769 --> 27:00.508
It's obvious you had your hand in it.
Who else if not you?

27:00.509 --> 27:02.108
You don't know
what you're talking about.

27:02.109 --> 27:04.709
We were just about
to catch the culprit.

27:04.710 --> 27:06.749
Because of the blackout,
we lost him.

27:06.750 --> 27:09.679
I just assumed that
you had something to do with it.

27:09.680 --> 27:10.719
I guess I was wrong.

27:10.720 --> 27:13.289
Before that,
Han Ji Hyuk attacked my guys first.

27:13.420 --> 27:16.259
And he helped the culprit get away.
Why did you leave that out?

27:17.119 --> 27:19.430
I heard that
he's not fully cleared for duty yet.

27:19.589 --> 27:21.930
How could you bring in
someone unstable like him?

27:24.569 --> 27:27.568
It looks like you're getting impatient,
Deputy Commissioner Do.

27:27.569 --> 27:30.299
I heard that you've been gathering support
from other branches.

27:30.769 --> 27:33.809
You're the one who's feeling impatient,
Deputy Commissioner Lee.

27:34.509 --> 27:36.910
You won't be able to get away
with it this time...

27:37.240 --> 27:38.680
like a year ago.

27:39.009 --> 27:41.519
All right. That's enough.

27:42.779 --> 27:46.149
Anyway, I don't think this will
help us resolve this matter.

27:46.150 --> 27:48.319
One of you should
take over the case exclusively.

27:52.359 --> 27:54.529
So I gave it some thought.

27:56.200 --> 27:58.360
Deputy Commissioner Lee,
you'll take care of this case.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.099
Sir.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.269
Given the nature of the incident,

28:04.569 --> 28:08.009
it'd be better if Domestic Intelligence
takes care of this matter.

28:14.250 --> 28:17.250
Is there anything else
we need to discuss?

28:25.660 --> 28:26.690
No.

28:27.190 --> 28:29.859
Put everyone available in our team
on this case.

28:30.430 --> 28:32.700
Don't forget. This just turned
into a race against time.

28:32.930 --> 28:34.140
Yes, ma'am.

28:35.400 --> 28:37.439
And what's up with Han Ji Hyuk?

28:37.440 --> 28:38.709
Why did he get involved like that?

28:38.710 --> 28:41.838
It must be his relationship
with Director Choi back in the day.

28:41.839 --> 28:43.410
Hey, Chief Ha.

28:43.640 --> 28:46.380
You know that he wouldn't do
something out of a friendship.

28:48.750 --> 28:51.849
Did something happen in Syria?

28:54.819 --> 28:57.059
No. Nothing out of the ordinary.

28:57.160 --> 29:00.289
But you should continue
to keep an eye on him just in case.

29:00.859 --> 29:01.960
Yes, ma'am.

29:16.740 --> 29:20.779
(Han Ji Hyuk)

29:22.920 --> 29:24.580
I heard from Director Kang.

29:25.590 --> 29:28.090
You got us the intel for the drug case
with the Chinese gang.

29:28.259 --> 29:31.120
I thought about treating you to a meal.

29:31.259 --> 29:32.930
Please get to the point.

29:34.229 --> 29:35.459
Sure.

29:37.259 --> 29:38.799
It's about Director Choi's son.

29:39.870 --> 29:41.299
Why are you chasing him?

29:42.940 --> 29:45.940
Is it because of what happened
in the past?

29:50.809 --> 29:53.010
(Syria, four years ago)

30:01.720 --> 30:03.260
You punk. Have you lost your mind?

30:05.659 --> 30:06.789
What's this?

30:06.790 --> 30:09.430
The data that shows how you've been
stealing money from our budget.

30:12.369 --> 30:14.129
You've been digging up dirt on me?

30:15.169 --> 30:16.169
So what?

30:17.440 --> 30:18.669
Don't come...

30:20.770 --> 30:23.010
anywhere near the field from now on.

30:27.379 --> 30:30.220
Are you still hung up on that?

30:30.550 --> 30:32.589
Did you call me here
to find out if I am?

30:36.460 --> 30:39.390
If you called me here about
what happened then, don't worry.

30:40.289 --> 30:41.829
I already decided to bury it.

30:42.400 --> 30:45.529
The fact that you sound so
categorical makes me more nervous.

30:46.599 --> 30:48.269
I'll get going then.

30:51.240 --> 30:54.410
Aren't you curious about Su Yeon?

30:54.569 --> 30:56.449
About how she ended up
in Domestic Intelligence?

30:56.809 --> 30:57.880
She...

30:58.609 --> 31:01.048
applied for a transfer to go there.

31:01.049 --> 31:02.679
But what's more interesting is...

31:02.680 --> 31:05.650
when she applied for that transfer.

31:06.990 --> 31:08.389
It was exactly two days...

31:08.390 --> 31:11.559
before you disappeared in Dandong
a year ago.

31:15.130 --> 31:16.329
I'm just saying.

31:16.529 --> 31:18.460
I thought you should know.

31:25.140 --> 31:27.769
Did you really fail to receive
any contact from us?

31:28.369 --> 31:29.839
The only thing you can say to me...

31:31.640 --> 31:33.150
in this situation...

31:34.480 --> 31:35.880
is that?

31:47.650 --> 31:50.949
We froze all of Choi Sang Kyun's
cards and assets you ordered.

31:51.880 --> 31:54.600
We have men watching all the people
that he has been in contact with.

31:54.749 --> 31:56.709
Do you know Yoo Je Yi
from the field support team?

31:56.759 --> 31:59.219
I'm talking about
Han Ji Hyuk's partner.

32:00.130 --> 32:02.629
Install the MPK program
on her cellphone.

32:02.630 --> 32:03.659
Pardon?

32:06.169 --> 32:07.169
That's a bit...

32:17.040 --> 32:18.140
Listen here, Mr. Kim.

32:18.880 --> 32:20.050
If it's about responsibility,

32:21.249 --> 32:23.449
I'll take full responsibility
for it,

32:23.979 --> 32:27.249
so go and do what I said.

32:27.950 --> 32:30.220
- Yes, ma'am.
- Go.

33:01.670 --> 33:02.940
(The Aslan's Castle is back.)

33:06.610 --> 33:07.850
(A Special Gift Delivery Event)

33:12.650 --> 33:13.709
(The Aslan's Castle is back.)

33:13.710 --> 33:14.710
Take a look at this.

33:15.010 --> 33:16.949
It's a spam email that I just got.

33:17.280 --> 33:18.349
This game...

33:18.849 --> 33:21.118
is an online game that Sang Kyun
and I used to play often.

33:21.119 --> 33:22.260
So?

33:22.460 --> 33:25.989
I thought the timing was weird,
so I looked into it.

33:26.929 --> 33:30.360
The IP address where it was sent
from is from Lithuania, not Korea.

33:30.500 --> 33:31.529
It's a method that...

33:31.530 --> 33:33.929
hackers use to avoid their
IP addresses from getting traced.

33:34.400 --> 33:37.469
They use a proxy server
from a different country to send it.

33:37.869 --> 33:40.070
So you think that Sang Kyun
sent this to you?

33:40.239 --> 33:42.710
Yes. When we used to play this game,

33:43.309 --> 33:45.650
we would talk through the chat
in the game.

33:45.949 --> 33:47.909
So Sang Kyun sent you a message?

33:50.050 --> 33:52.590
I think talking to him here
or at home is dangerous,

33:52.690 --> 33:54.690
so I'm going to log in
at an Internet cafe.

33:55.119 --> 33:56.389
Okay. Do that.

34:01.730 --> 34:04.500
Go ahead first. I'm going to stop
somewhere and meet up with you.

34:26.750 --> 34:28.090
I'm sorry.

34:28.590 --> 34:31.730
I should've gotten a drink
with you sooner.

34:32.130 --> 34:34.260
It seems you had a lot to drink.
That's enough.

34:35.429 --> 34:36.500
I'm fine.

34:38.429 --> 34:40.969
How is it working with Chief Ha?

34:41.969 --> 34:43.938
Everything is okay for now.

34:44.063 --> 34:48.233
Did you hear... how Chief Ha's daughter
passed away while you were gone?

34:48.759 --> 34:50.717
I heard about it during the funeral,

34:50.741 --> 34:53.630
but it was a rare disease
that I had never heard of.

34:53.699 --> 34:59.299
Because of all of the hospital bills,
he got involved with future investments.

34:59.699 --> 35:02.269
Then he ended up losing
everything he had.

35:02.293 --> 35:05.393
Even if he seems okay,
I'm sure he's dying on the inside.

35:10.079 --> 35:11.110
Ji Hyuk.

35:12.050 --> 35:13.078
Yes?

35:13.079 --> 35:16.220
I contemplated a lot while
I was coming here.

35:18.319 --> 35:19.959
I wasn't sure if I should
say this to you.

35:22.460 --> 35:23.460
About...

35:24.399 --> 35:26.370
the incident in Shenyang.

35:28.469 --> 35:31.439
I think Deputy Commissioner Do
is hiding something.

35:32.969 --> 35:35.109
Before your team was sent in,

35:35.580 --> 35:39.210
Director Kim Dong Hwan and the other
two agents who died in China...

35:39.850 --> 35:43.149
were on a covert mission
ordered by Deputy Commissioner Do.

35:43.950 --> 35:45.549
Right until they died.

35:48.419 --> 35:50.460
It seems like
she doesn't trust me either.

35:52.129 --> 35:55.759
She sealed all the records
as top secret.

35:57.529 --> 35:58.569
But it seems like...

35:59.369 --> 36:01.869
it was leaked during
the most recent hacking incident.

36:06.110 --> 36:07.179
Are you sure?

36:08.440 --> 36:11.009
I verified through someone
in that department.

36:11.580 --> 36:14.019
Plus, Domestic Intelligence...

36:14.020 --> 36:16.380
is throwing a fit because of
the civilian inspection case...

36:16.850 --> 36:18.250
was leaked.

36:19.359 --> 36:21.860
Whether you like it or not,

36:21.890 --> 36:23.760
Domestic and Foreign Intelligence...

36:24.200 --> 36:26.729
are the two axes that support
our organization.

36:27.630 --> 36:28.630
But...

36:29.029 --> 36:33.040
if one side ends up with their hands
on the other side's fatal weakness,

36:33.810 --> 36:35.010
what do you think will happen?

36:36.670 --> 36:37.909
That's why I want to say...

36:38.980 --> 36:40.300
Was Director Choi's son's name...

36:41.050 --> 36:42.380
Sang Kyun?

36:44.480 --> 36:45.480
Yes.

36:46.150 --> 36:48.789
If you find him first,

36:49.650 --> 36:51.389
let's try to ensure that
a neutral team...

36:52.320 --> 36:54.230
can collect the leaked information...

36:54.760 --> 36:57.199
so that no one side can get
their hands on it.

36:57.829 --> 36:59.760
Is there a team like that
in our organization?

37:00.230 --> 37:02.500
I'll look for a way.

37:14.380 --> 37:16.780
(Earth View: Sang Kyun.)

37:19.079 --> 37:21.749
(Earth View: Sang Kyun,
are you there? It's me, Je Yi.)

37:28.059 --> 37:29.090
Hello?

37:29.530 --> 37:30.829
Did you get anything?

37:32.599 --> 37:33.669
Not yet.

37:34.530 --> 37:37.340
I think I'm going to have to stay up
all night.

37:38.070 --> 37:40.240
I'm wondering if I was wrong too.

37:40.470 --> 37:44.110
The only person that Sang Kyun can trust
right now is you.

37:46.619 --> 37:47.679
I wonder...

37:48.750 --> 37:51.389
where he is and what he's doing
right now.

37:52.119 --> 37:54.019
What he's thinking about.

37:54.760 --> 37:56.558
He was always a lonely kid...

37:56.559 --> 37:59.929
who had nobody but Director Choi.

38:02.199 --> 38:05.669
I'm sure he's going
to contact you again. Just wait.

38:06.600 --> 38:10.238
(Earth View: Sang Kyun,
are you there? It's me, Je Yi.)

38:10.239 --> 38:11.710
(Perses has logged in.)

38:15.040 --> 38:16.280
(Perses: Je Yi, are you there?)

38:22.480 --> 38:24.190
(Perses: Je Yi, are you there?)

38:26.659 --> 38:30.259
(Earth View: Yes, I am.
Where are you?)

38:43.909 --> 38:45.110
Please come with me.

38:52.049 --> 38:56.389
It must sound like a request
because I'm being nice.

38:58.290 --> 39:00.060
Your behavior...

39:00.489 --> 39:03.659
is a serious breach
of internal regulations.

39:03.889 --> 39:04.889
No.

39:06.860 --> 39:10.130
You're the one who is
abusing your power.

39:10.429 --> 39:11.468
Abusing my power?

39:11.469 --> 39:14.139
How could you wiretap an employee?

39:15.100 --> 39:17.670
Are you seriously unaware of...

39:19.040 --> 39:21.880
why Director Choi ended up like that
and why all of this has happened?

39:21.980 --> 39:23.380
Even still,

39:24.980 --> 39:26.750
nothing will change.

39:29.719 --> 39:33.319
There's only one choice
that has been given to you.

39:33.560 --> 39:35.889
Then do whatever you want.

39:37.429 --> 39:39.560
You've already
listened to our conversation.

39:39.699 --> 39:41.199
I need you...

39:41.900 --> 39:44.929
to go and meet him yourself.

39:47.299 --> 39:48.299
It's not me.

39:48.369 --> 39:49.540
I told you already.

39:50.569 --> 39:52.109
You don't have a choice.

39:52.110 --> 39:53.380
That's not what I mean.

39:54.040 --> 39:56.480
It should be Ji Hyuk who meets him.

39:59.110 --> 40:00.818
Do you think this is a game?

40:00.819 --> 40:03.520
It's not me
who Sang Kyun wants to meet.

40:03.619 --> 40:04.989
It's Ji Hyuk.

40:06.920 --> 40:09.159
If you don't believe me,
shall I show you our chat log?

40:12.360 --> 40:14.529
(Seoul Station)

40:18.529 --> 40:21.469
I'm sorry for messing things up.

40:21.670 --> 40:23.440
I should've been more cautious.

40:23.940 --> 40:26.310
It's fine. Now focus.

40:27.239 --> 40:28.239
Okay.

40:33.380 --> 40:36.850
Why do you think Sang Kyun
asked to see you?

40:37.219 --> 40:38.919
In a crowded place like this too.

40:38.920 --> 40:41.920
I don't know either.
That'll be the first thing I ask.

40:43.659 --> 40:46.830
Do you think he'll show up?

40:47.159 --> 40:48.900
After what happened last time.

40:49.670 --> 40:50.769
He will show up.

40:50.770 --> 40:53.069
He's in desperate need
of answers himself.

40:53.770 --> 40:56.569
Even so, I doubt it'll be easy
to get out of here.

40:57.569 --> 40:58.670
What should we do?

41:08.179 --> 41:11.489
We're just minutes away.
Keep your wits about you.

41:17.029 --> 41:18.929
I'll say this again.

41:19.259 --> 41:22.759
Without my permission,
you are not to move.

41:31.869 --> 41:34.080
Sir, it's almost time.

41:35.679 --> 41:36.880
(Arrivals)

41:45.520 --> 41:47.060
Is there anything unusual?

41:47.119 --> 41:48.819
No, not yet.

41:51.960 --> 41:53.360
What is it?

41:54.130 --> 41:55.860
Six minutes have passed.

41:56.100 --> 41:57.630
Do you think he caught on?

42:05.869 --> 42:08.508
What's this? Who moved the camera?

42:08.509 --> 42:09.810
It's not us.

42:11.009 --> 42:12.048
Shoot.

42:12.049 --> 42:13.049
(Arrivals)

42:13.049 --> 42:14.049
(Perses)

42:16.549 --> 42:17.549
Sir.

42:19.759 --> 42:20.860
Over there.

42:23.330 --> 42:24.529
Perses.

42:25.089 --> 42:26.699
It's Sang Kyun's gaming ID.

42:28.600 --> 42:30.229
(Perses)

42:30.230 --> 42:31.799
(Airport Express 14:12)

42:40.580 --> 42:41.610
Sir.

42:42.239 --> 42:43.279
Sir.

42:45.580 --> 42:48.020
Ma'am, T1 and T2 are on the move.

42:48.049 --> 42:49.480
Go after them!

43:21.580 --> 43:22.950
(Subway Platform)

43:32.160 --> 43:34.230
(Seoul Station)

44:04.129 --> 44:05.560
We meet again.

44:08.770 --> 44:09.969
Choi Sang Kyun.

44:15.469 --> 44:18.480
You said I didn't keep a promise.
What did you mean by that?

44:20.980 --> 44:22.710
Have we met before?

44:23.310 --> 44:24.350
No.

44:24.649 --> 44:26.219
Then why did you say that?

44:29.520 --> 44:31.219
You asked to see me.

44:33.719 --> 44:35.029
The laptop.

44:37.230 --> 44:39.160
I saw it on Dad's laptop.

44:40.160 --> 44:42.169
A few days before he died,

44:42.370 --> 44:44.299
you and he talked online.

44:45.739 --> 44:47.040
I saw that.

44:47.469 --> 44:48.669
We talked online?

44:51.480 --> 44:54.080
I talked online with your dad?

44:57.879 --> 44:59.180
Can I see it?

45:03.319 --> 45:05.059
I was in an accident a year ago...

45:05.060 --> 45:07.430
that caused some issues
with my memory.

45:08.460 --> 45:10.459
I'm saying I lost my memory
from the past year...

45:10.460 --> 45:13.359
including chatting
to your dad online.

45:13.899 --> 45:17.399
It was a private conversation
between me and Il Lak, right?

45:18.739 --> 45:21.569
Then I think it's okay
for me to know what we said.

45:23.140 --> 45:25.980
About a week before my dad died,

45:27.580 --> 45:29.580
you contacted him urgently...

45:29.750 --> 45:31.549
saying you were in Shenyang.

45:34.080 --> 45:36.890
- And?
- And you asked for a favor.

45:38.020 --> 45:39.290
What was that?

45:39.719 --> 45:43.029
You said someone from Dandong
urgently contacted the NIS.

45:44.060 --> 45:47.029
You asked him to find out
who answered the call.

45:52.069 --> 45:53.299
Who was it?

45:58.580 --> 45:59.839
Who was it?

46:00.949 --> 46:03.980
That's where the conversation ended.

46:05.880 --> 46:07.489
Not long after that,

46:08.619 --> 46:10.650
my dad died.

46:14.560 --> 46:16.060
Now it's my turn.

46:16.889 --> 46:19.060
Why didn't you help my dad?

46:19.259 --> 46:21.100
He was in need of help.

46:22.730 --> 46:24.969
Did you just use him too?

46:30.110 --> 46:32.980
It's the last word you exchanged
in the conversation.

46:33.339 --> 46:36.009
I looked everywhere
and couldn't find out what it meant.

46:36.150 --> 46:37.520
What is this?

46:45.460 --> 46:46.659
Sang Kyun.

46:47.190 --> 46:49.429
You hear me, don't you?

46:51.429 --> 46:54.529
I'm a colleague of your dad's.

46:54.929 --> 46:58.499
Someone will be waiting for you
at the next station.

46:58.500 --> 47:01.009
Get off and turn yourself in.

47:01.239 --> 47:04.139
If you do that, I'll make sure...

47:04.310 --> 47:06.409
you get a lesser charge.

47:07.080 --> 47:08.980
The man standing before you...

47:09.380 --> 47:11.519
is the man who broke your dad's leg.

47:11.520 --> 47:13.080
You must not trust him.

47:14.049 --> 47:15.619
If you don't believe me,

47:16.290 --> 47:18.089
ask him yourself.

47:20.960 --> 47:22.330
Is it true?

47:24.089 --> 47:25.360
It's not, is it?

47:26.259 --> 47:27.360
No, right?

47:28.429 --> 47:30.600
Do not trust him...

47:30.730 --> 47:32.199
and get off at the next station.

47:32.540 --> 47:33.639
Only then...

47:35.139 --> 47:36.270
can you live.

47:49.190 --> 47:50.319
Choi Sang Kyun!

48:10.880 --> 48:13.110
Do Jin Sook
will try to do something.

48:13.679 --> 48:15.580
Lock the IT Office down...

48:15.679 --> 48:17.619
and obtain what's on the laptop.

48:18.020 --> 48:19.880
Start with Foreign Intelligence.

48:20.080 --> 48:21.089
Yes, sir.

48:26.960 --> 48:29.460
(NIS)

48:38.540 --> 48:40.798
- Come on.
- Let us in.

48:40.799 --> 48:43.408
- Let's go inside.
- Not now.

48:43.409 --> 48:45.440
(IT Office)

48:51.619 --> 48:54.219
What do you mean
you couldn't even get in?

48:56.719 --> 48:58.619
Chief Ha, listen carefully.

48:59.219 --> 49:00.618
Get in there now...

49:00.619 --> 49:02.689
and stop Domestic Intelligence
from taking the intel.

49:02.690 --> 49:04.089
Do you understand?

49:04.299 --> 49:06.900
I don't care what it takes!
Get in there!

49:14.469 --> 49:15.469
What is it?

49:15.670 --> 49:17.710
I'd like to question Choi Sang Kyun.

49:19.339 --> 49:21.110
Don't you see the current situation?

49:21.279 --> 49:24.279
I can sort it out. Let me see him.

49:27.259 --> 49:28.529
Sang Kyun.

49:28.559 --> 49:32.870
I used to know your late father.

49:33.369 --> 49:35.500
I'll say this
out of concern for you.

49:35.940 --> 49:38.269
You're sorely mistaken
if you think...

49:38.270 --> 49:40.969
you'll get a lighter sentence
because you're a minor.

49:41.170 --> 49:43.440
If we really get down to it,

49:43.610 --> 49:46.110
we can dump over ten charges on you.

49:47.009 --> 49:49.149
I compared it
to the list on our database.

49:49.150 --> 49:50.649
I don't see any problems.

49:50.650 --> 49:52.448
They're mostly still there.

49:52.449 --> 49:53.718
Open the log records...

49:53.719 --> 49:56.618
and see if they left
via any networks or devices.

49:56.619 --> 49:58.630
- Okay.
- How long will this take?

49:58.960 --> 50:00.630
Our boss is hounding us.

50:00.929 --> 50:04.099
We'll have to clear it by security,
so it'll take a few hours.

50:04.100 --> 50:07.298
Mr. Jang, didn't you hear him say
the boss is waiting?

50:07.299 --> 50:09.769
- Patch into it directly.
- Won't that be too risky?

50:09.770 --> 50:11.670
- Get up. I'll do it.
- Okay.

50:22.020 --> 50:23.020
What is this?

50:24.750 --> 50:28.219
So you didn't even touch the files
you stole from us.

50:28.360 --> 50:30.560
Then why did you hack
into our server, to begin with?

50:31.190 --> 50:34.630
Or did you have an ulterior motive?

50:35.299 --> 50:36.400
You are...

50:37.699 --> 50:38.929
smarter than I thought.

50:39.429 --> 50:40.429
What?

50:43.040 --> 50:44.040
You.

50:44.639 --> 50:46.009
You punk.

50:46.409 --> 50:47.639
Do you have a watch?

50:48.040 --> 50:49.139
What time is it now?

50:50.779 --> 50:51.810
Your watch is...

50:52.480 --> 50:53.710
accurate, right?

50:59.350 --> 51:01.589
This is already spreading
into the server rapidly.

51:01.790 --> 51:03.790
I think this is a root key.

51:08.830 --> 51:11.500
- I got nothing to say to you now.
- What?

51:11.630 --> 51:13.170
I want to talk to someone else.

51:14.830 --> 51:15.939
Someone with more power than you.

51:15.940 --> 51:17.600
You brat. You're unbelievable.

51:17.900 --> 51:19.100
Did you even hear what I said?

51:21.940 --> 51:24.980
I'm about to bring down your agency.

51:26.679 --> 51:28.380
And every file you have.

51:28.549 --> 51:31.549
What should we do?
I think we lost our entire server.

51:31.690 --> 51:34.149
Every single file on our server is
hacked to be destroyed.

51:34.150 --> 51:36.019
Why don't we force to restart?

51:36.020 --> 51:37.959
No.
Every time we restart the server,

51:37.960 --> 51:39.659
the virus will duplicate itself.

51:39.889 --> 51:42.159
Perhaps, this could've been
his plan all along.

51:42.259 --> 51:44.298
What? This was his plan?

51:44.299 --> 51:46.568
He wanted us
to activate the virus internally.

51:46.569 --> 51:48.209
So he planted it in his laptop
in advance.

51:48.540 --> 51:49.799
- Call them now.
- Okay.

52:04.049 --> 52:05.190
What happened?

52:05.350 --> 52:08.659
I think it was a trap.

52:09.960 --> 52:12.189
When the clock hits 8 p.m.,

52:12.190 --> 52:15.900
every file on the server
will be ordered to be destroyed.

52:17.759 --> 52:19.299
How can we deactivate that?

52:19.400 --> 52:21.129
You must have added
some kind of password.

52:21.130 --> 52:22.930
Do you think
I'll just hand over the password?

52:24.670 --> 52:26.540
To you people who killed my father?

52:27.009 --> 52:29.508
Hey, Sang Kyun. Don't do this.
Why don't you calm down?

52:29.509 --> 52:33.210
You killed my dad
to cover up your dirty laundry.

52:35.719 --> 52:40.020
Hey, Sang Kyun. I don't know
why you came to that conclusion.

52:40.219 --> 52:42.159
But that's not true. Okay?

52:42.189 --> 52:44.429
Hey, this won't resolve anything.

52:44.430 --> 52:45.460
Resolve?

52:47.899 --> 52:49.930
Do you think
that's what I want to do right now?

52:50.169 --> 52:52.140
I don't care
if this gets resolved or not.

52:52.739 --> 52:53.770
I want to destroy you.

53:03.980 --> 53:06.779
I'm sick of watching
how you people twist the truth...

53:07.279 --> 53:09.089
and turn it into lies.

53:15.759 --> 53:17.730
You work for the country?

53:18.460 --> 53:19.759
Don't fool yourselves.

53:21.870 --> 53:24.969
All of you just watched my dad die!

53:28.969 --> 53:30.210
You're all monsters.

53:33.210 --> 53:34.810
Watch me...

53:35.180 --> 53:37.149
how I destroy you.

53:41.290 --> 53:43.119
Why don't we force him?

53:43.120 --> 53:44.818
I'll call specialists for this.

53:44.819 --> 53:48.188
No, sir. He's only a kid.

53:48.189 --> 53:49.259
What?

53:49.830 --> 53:52.430
Are you serious?
How can you say that right now?

53:52.730 --> 53:54.330
- I'm sorry.
- That's fine.

53:54.969 --> 53:56.500
We're pressed for time.

53:57.230 --> 53:59.140
- Can he hear me from inside?
- Yes.

54:01.100 --> 54:04.980
I'm Deputy Commissioner Lee In Hwan.
I heard what you said.

54:05.180 --> 54:07.379
So tell me what you want.

54:08.210 --> 54:11.049
Then I'll see if I can give you
what you want or not.

54:11.379 --> 54:12.620
Not him.

54:15.890 --> 54:18.219
Get me Han Ji Hyuk.

54:22.630 --> 54:25.500
Sir, he's trying to stall time.

54:25.630 --> 54:27.000
We can't let him call the shots.

54:36.210 --> 54:37.440
Sir, it's me.

54:37.969 --> 54:40.510
We don't have time.
You need to make a decision now.

54:41.510 --> 54:44.780
You know that you are
fully responsible for this. Right?

54:46.119 --> 54:47.150
What's your point?

54:47.750 --> 54:51.050
As he requested, let him talk to
Han Ji Hyuk and get this resolved.

54:51.719 --> 54:53.619
That's the best option we have.

54:54.219 --> 54:56.159
If you comply with this,

54:57.030 --> 55:00.699
I won't raise any problems
regarding this incident.

55:04.170 --> 55:05.230
Sir.

55:06.139 --> 55:07.539
Please decide.

55:08.739 --> 55:10.570
Fine. Let's do that.

55:31.329 --> 55:33.899
We can't have a normal conversation
in the interrogation room...

55:33.900 --> 55:35.869
where everyone is watching.

55:36.199 --> 55:39.939
Allow me to talk to him
in a different room privately.

55:39.940 --> 55:43.670
Hey, how dare you make demands?

55:43.969 --> 55:46.309
But I promise you
that I will fix this.

55:49.510 --> 55:50.710
Go ahead.

55:51.909 --> 55:53.820
But you'd better...

55:57.250 --> 55:58.920
deliver on what you promised.

56:28.920 --> 56:30.590
It's safe here. We can talk here.

56:34.360 --> 56:36.760
Why did you ask to see me again?

56:39.059 --> 56:40.099
I never...

56:41.099 --> 56:42.630
got your answer.

56:45.369 --> 56:49.269
What does the last word
you exchanged with my dad mean?

56:53.980 --> 56:55.809
A few years ago,
we were trying to arrest...

56:56.550 --> 56:59.018
an arms dealer who was selling
North Korean weapons to Syria.

56:59.019 --> 57:00.750
So we put together a team.

57:01.480 --> 57:02.550
Back then,

57:03.619 --> 57:06.619
Director Choi was on the team
as an expert for wiretapping.

57:09.530 --> 57:11.130
But there was a problem.

57:11.829 --> 57:12.899
What's this?

57:12.900 --> 57:15.540
The data that shows how you've been
stealing money from our budget.

57:15.730 --> 57:18.330
One of our team members pocketed
money we had to use to buy intel.

57:19.269 --> 57:21.709
So we lost a chance to buy
an important piece of intelligence.

57:22.469 --> 57:24.440
You punk. Get up.

57:24.610 --> 57:27.339
I'm the one who makes decisions.
I'm in charge, not you!

57:27.340 --> 57:29.178
Please stop it.

57:29.179 --> 57:30.949
We don't have time
to fight right now.

57:31.610 --> 57:32.650
Mr. Choi.

57:36.050 --> 57:37.650
May I suggest a plan?

57:38.960 --> 57:40.289
There's no problem.

57:40.789 --> 57:44.288
A boy from the militia
the insurgent army set us up with...

57:44.289 --> 57:47.400
volunteered to install
the wiretapping device...

57:47.699 --> 57:51.070
because since he was young,
he wouldn't raise any suspicions.

57:52.570 --> 57:54.300
But the plan failed.

57:59.679 --> 58:02.380
The organization we were after
found out about our plan.

58:02.550 --> 58:04.449
- Clear.
- All clear.

58:06.920 --> 58:09.889
He was skinned
and tortured painfully.

58:11.289 --> 58:13.760
But he didn't say anything about us.

58:15.929 --> 58:18.059
Even when he drew his last breath.

58:21.260 --> 58:24.500
Before we put him on the mission,
I asked him a question.

58:24.869 --> 58:26.769
Why are you willing to go this far?

58:27.639 --> 58:29.369
His answer was simple.

58:34.139 --> 58:36.749
It was because
they were his and our enemies.

58:39.650 --> 58:42.079
Director Choi argued
that we should get even.

58:42.249 --> 58:43.990
I can't leave like this.

58:44.389 --> 58:46.660
You all saw how he died.

58:48.019 --> 58:49.630
If we pull out now,

58:49.860 --> 58:52.499
his death would have been pointless.

58:58.369 --> 58:59.869
I should've stood on my ground.

59:00.639 --> 59:02.669
But I let him talk me into it.

59:23.659 --> 59:26.660
And that's how...
the incident happened.

59:40.570 --> 59:43.939
Back then, I couldn't understand
why he was willing to go that far.

59:44.780 --> 59:46.110
But I get it now.

59:48.780 --> 59:51.320
What do you mean?

59:52.349 --> 59:55.320
The dead boy
from the militia in Syria.

59:57.059 --> 59:58.260
He was about your age.

01:00:00.990 --> 01:00:02.360
He must have seen you...

01:00:04.099 --> 01:00:05.269
through that boy.

01:00:14.839 --> 01:00:17.239
The files are going to get deleted
at any minute.

01:00:19.210 --> 01:00:21.148
Call them. And tell them to hurry!

01:00:21.149 --> 01:00:22.149
Okay.

01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:30.359
So you don't think
your father committed suicide.

01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:31.660
So what?

01:00:32.790 --> 01:00:34.759
Do you think I'm delusional too?

01:00:34.859 --> 01:00:36.359
No. I agree with you.

01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:39.568
I lost all of my colleagues
a year ago...

01:00:39.569 --> 01:00:41.169
because of a traitor
in our organization.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.899
The person
I asked Director Choi to find...

01:00:48.169 --> 01:00:49.839
was that traitor.

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:53.049
Are you saying...

01:00:55.279 --> 01:00:57.250
that my dad died because
of that person?

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:00.188
That person even tried to kill
the informant...

01:01:00.189 --> 01:01:02.259
that made the emergency call
from Dandong.

01:01:03.189 --> 01:01:06.089
If they knew that Director Choi
was going after them,

01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:09.299
they would've tried to get
rid of him.

01:01:11.770 --> 01:01:13.230
No way.

01:01:13.399 --> 01:01:17.169
You asked what the last word
in our last conversation...

01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:19.640
on the messenger meant.

01:01:20.239 --> 01:01:22.710
It's the last thing that
the Syrian child from the militia...

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:25.009
said to us.

01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:29.450
What does it mean?

01:01:35.319 --> 01:01:36.790
"Mutual enemy."

01:01:42.330 --> 01:01:43.529
Listen carefully.

01:01:43.799 --> 01:01:46.729
The person you have to seek
revenge on isn't this organization.

01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:49.500
It's the rat that's hiding among us.

01:01:50.439 --> 01:01:51.640
So...

01:01:52.239 --> 01:01:54.839
let me handle the revenge
you were planning.

01:01:57.410 --> 01:02:00.109
You and I are going after
the same enemy.

01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:11.389
Did you say...

01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:15.230
that word meant "mutual enemy"?

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:21.869
Tell them.

01:02:22.929 --> 01:02:24.269
That's the code...

01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:26.670
to stop the delete order.

01:02:36.110 --> 01:02:37.619
Hang in until the end.

01:02:38.619 --> 01:02:41.650
I'm going to find the culprit
and make them pay.

01:03:10.219 --> 01:03:11.420
Are you okay?

01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:15.250
Okay.

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.719
They stopped the delete order.

01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:05.929
What does it mean?

01:04:06.829 --> 01:04:08.199
"Mutual enemy."

01:04:08.530 --> 01:04:11.599
The person you have to seek
revenge on isn't this organization.

01:04:12.610 --> 01:04:15.440
It's the rat that's hiding among us.

01:04:15.909 --> 01:04:17.210
So...

01:04:18.210 --> 01:04:20.949
let me handle the revenge
you were planning.

01:04:24.019 --> 01:04:25.549
Don't worry too much.

01:04:25.719 --> 01:04:27.659
Luckily, nothing big happened,

01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:29.429
so your punishment
won't be that heavy.

01:04:31.199 --> 01:04:32.929
Do you need anything?

01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:42.510
(Phone)

01:04:45.579 --> 01:04:47.079
Is it important?

01:04:50.550 --> 01:04:52.649
(National Intelligence Service Korea)

01:05:00.229 --> 01:05:03.429
(Seo Su Yeon)

01:05:15.679 --> 01:05:17.150
Do you want something to drink?

01:05:17.379 --> 01:05:19.850
No, it's fine. Did something happen?

01:05:22.419 --> 01:05:24.418
No, nothing happened.

01:05:24.419 --> 01:05:25.560
I just...

01:05:26.759 --> 01:05:30.389
thought I should sit down
and have a conversation with you.

01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:36.200
Hold on.

01:05:42.410 --> 01:05:43.509
Yes.

01:05:45.209 --> 01:05:47.709
No. I'll give it to them.

01:05:48.310 --> 01:05:49.350
Okay.

01:05:53.850 --> 01:05:54.850
Sorry.

01:05:55.249 --> 01:05:57.350
Can you wait here?
It'll only take a minute.

01:06:30.850 --> 01:06:33.719
There's this resort
right by the beach there,

01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:36.628
and the view of the sunset
from the terrace...

01:06:36.629 --> 01:06:38.429
is amazing.

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.440
What is it?

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:53.010
Hello? It's me, Choi Sang Kyun.

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:54.978
I'm calling you in secret,

01:06:54.979 --> 01:06:56.450
so I'll get straight to it.

01:06:56.479 --> 01:06:59.348
My dad always told me to hold onto
my final card until the end.

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:01.149
That's why I thought about it
for a long time.

01:07:01.589 --> 01:07:03.420
Hello? Are you listening?

01:07:05.059 --> 01:07:06.558
Go ahead. I'm listening.

01:07:06.559 --> 01:07:07.790
To be honest,

01:07:08.759 --> 01:07:12.160
my dad said he found that person
on the messenger.

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:16.370
The last person to get contacted
during the emergency in Dandong.

01:07:17.299 --> 01:07:18.799
That person's name is...

01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:21.009
Seo...

01:07:25.610 --> 01:07:26.839
Su Yeon.

01:07:28.049 --> 01:07:29.280
That's what it said.

01:07:50.370 --> 01:07:53.299
(The Veil)

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:26.868
There are some serious rumors
going around about Seo Su Yeon.

01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:28.738
How did Su Yeon end up like that?

01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:30.268
Why is this person here?

01:08:30.269 --> 01:08:32.978
Don't mention this person's name
to anyone.

01:08:32.979 --> 01:08:35.408
- Who did it? Tell me!
- Han Ji Hyuk!

01:08:35.410 --> 01:08:37.209
You've already reached your limit.

01:08:37.210 --> 01:08:39.578
You're like a time bomb
that's waiting to explode!

01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:42.689
Ji Hyuk. The basement garage.
Hurry!

01:08:43.750 --> 01:08:45.018
It's been a while.

01:08:45.019 --> 01:08:46.089
Shut your mouth!

01:08:47.359 --> 01:08:51.000
You should stop doing what
you were planning.

01:08:51.129 --> 01:08:54.368
You can't catch them
just because you know who they are.

01:08:54.370 --> 01:08:56.170
Who told you to tell me this?
