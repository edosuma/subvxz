WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:12.178
[DeMarcus] What's up,
my name is DeMarcus Tillman.

00:14.055 --> 00:15.849
If you don't already know who I am,

00:16.349 --> 00:17.475
you'll find out soon enough.

00:18.768 --> 00:20.645
He's an all-around player. He can shoot,

00:21.396 --> 00:23.815
pass, he's got the boards, blocks,

00:23.898 --> 00:24.774
steals.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.610
His speed, his movement is unsurpassed.

00:27.694 --> 00:28.903
No one's quicker than DeMarcus.

00:30.238 --> 00:31.781
[Isaiah] Lateral speed.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.700
That's what sets DeMarcus apart.

00:33.950 --> 00:37.078
He'll cross you like Kyrie,
then cut back like Curry.

00:40.832 --> 00:42.208
[DeMarcus] What are my strengths?

00:42.292 --> 00:45.503
I feel like it'd be easier to ask
what my weaknesses are.

00:46.671 --> 00:48.506
Which really don't think I have any.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.720
[crowd cheers]

00:54.888 --> 00:56.848
[Bob] Oh, yeah, he's always joking.

00:56.931 --> 00:59.726
He's joking with the players, with me.

00:59.809 --> 01:01.352
He's got the refs laughing.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.438
I mean, he's hysterical.

01:03.521 --> 01:06.191
But don't let that fool you,
he's a competitor.

01:06.274 --> 01:09.527
He practices day and night
until they close up shop.

01:10.487 --> 01:11.488
[rim rattles]

01:12.781 --> 01:14.115
[Lou] Back in sixth grade,

01:14.199 --> 01:17.660
when we had no fancy court
or fancy uniforms or nothing,

01:17.744 --> 01:19.913
it was just summer rec league ball.

01:19.996 --> 01:21.915
And hand-me-downs back at Rainier Beach.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.585
Even back then,
you knew D was gon' make it.

01:26.503 --> 01:29.214
[DeMarcus] Think I was
like ten years old when I realized--

01:29.881 --> 01:31.216
I felt like I was different.

01:32.133 --> 01:33.426
When we go out the street,

01:33.510 --> 01:36.179
I'd play kids that was older,
five, ten years older than me,

01:36.262 --> 01:38.056
and it's like I could keep up.

01:38.139 --> 01:40.850
Some of those people,
they my biggest supporters to this day,

01:40.934 --> 01:42.685
'cause they feel like
they watched me grow up.

01:42.769 --> 01:44.062
But it all started here.

01:45.855 --> 01:47.857
[crowd cheering]

01:48.858 --> 01:50.068
And he's a natural leader.

01:51.611 --> 01:55.031
He's got a high basketball IQ,
and barring injury,

01:55.115 --> 01:56.741
he's going to be a very high lottery pick.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.245
[DeMarcus] Mr. Untouchable.

02:00.995 --> 02:02.247
I like that name.

02:02.330 --> 02:04.666
We had a game, I think it was
my seventh grade year,

02:04.749 --> 02:07.293
and it was like 20 seconds left
and we was up,

02:07.377 --> 02:09.754
so I knew once I inbound it,
they wanted to foul me.

02:09.838 --> 02:12.298
So when I got the ball,
I just had to shout in my mind,

02:12.382 --> 02:14.008
"They're not touching you."

02:14.092 --> 02:16.511
I'm dribbling around, I'm crossing,
running off screens.

02:16.594 --> 02:18.054
I felt like Flash,

02:18.138 --> 02:20.723
like I was just diving through,
cutting through everybody.

02:21.391 --> 02:23.268
Snap this guy's ankles, you know?

02:23.351 --> 02:25.145
This dude's kneecaps is on the ground.

02:26.771 --> 02:29.858
And they couldn't touch him, so,
Mr. Untouchable.

02:32.026 --> 02:33.111
The violin.

02:33.194 --> 02:34.904
The violin is, like, my celebration.

02:35.363 --> 02:36.614
You know? It's for the haters.

02:36.698 --> 02:39.409
Everybody complaining,
everybody got something negative to say.

02:39.492 --> 02:41.828
Just trying to explain
why they can't touch me.

02:42.537 --> 02:44.831
There you go,
there's an instrumental for you.

02:45.665 --> 02:49.043
For all the sad songs you sing,
I got this for you right here.

02:51.421 --> 02:52.881
'Cause I'm Mr. Untouchable.

02:54.424 --> 02:56.259
[intro music playing]

03:33.338 --> 03:35.048
[Peter Maldonado] Who is DeMarcus Tillman?

03:36.049 --> 03:37.675
He's the premier athlete in the state,

03:38.092 --> 03:39.761
the pride of St. Bernardine.

03:40.136 --> 03:41.846
And such a prominent fixture
of the school,

03:42.597 --> 03:44.933
that they put his picture
on the high school's homepage,

03:45.016 --> 03:48.269
which means if Chloe Lyman's
accusations are right,

03:48.353 --> 03:50.355
and DeMarcus is the Turd Burglar,

03:50.980 --> 03:52.774
responsible for all three crimes,

03:54.108 --> 03:55.693
the school had a lot to lose.

03:55.944 --> 03:56.986
It was DeMarcus.

03:57.862 --> 03:58.988
I know what I saw.

04:00.156 --> 04:02.075
It was the day before the Poop Piñata.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.202
We were at an away game.

04:04.285 --> 04:06.663
The girls had just played
and the boys were up next.

04:06.746 --> 04:09.332
I ran into him in line
at the vending machine.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.042
He was getting some Gatorade,

04:11.584 --> 04:14.128
and he pulled out this shitty, old wallet,

04:14.837 --> 04:16.422
and that's when I saw it.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.886
It was a Turd Burglar card,
just like the one on Instagram.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.306
That's how I knew that Kevin was innocent.

04:26.015 --> 04:27.517
No other card looks like it.

04:28.351 --> 04:29.477
It's poop.

04:30.311 --> 04:31.688
How well do you remember that day?

04:32.397 --> 04:33.940
It was a Thursday.

04:34.023 --> 04:36.109
We'd just played Tollgate.

04:37.610 --> 04:38.903
The girls lost by one point,

04:38.987 --> 04:40.905
but the boys won in a landslide.

04:41.781 --> 04:43.574
It was honestly over by halftime.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.869
And what's your relationship like
with DeMarcus?

04:47.870 --> 04:50.999
Great. No,
I have nothing against DeMarcus.

04:51.749 --> 04:53.751
-Oh, yeah!
-[cheering]

04:54.502 --> 04:58.298
When the girls are playing,
he comes out and cheers us on.

04:59.757 --> 05:01.050
Pay attention, ref!

05:01.134 --> 05:03.219
She's fouling Claire every time!

05:03.303 --> 05:05.763
Claire, Beth, Samantha, Becky...

05:05.847 --> 05:08.599
So I love DeMarcus. I really do.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.768
And did anyone else see the card?

05:12.186 --> 05:13.980
Gonzo did, but he's...

05:15.189 --> 05:17.150
definitely not gonna talk about it.

05:17.233 --> 05:18.192
[Peter] Why not?

05:18.276 --> 05:20.486
[Chloe] He's on the basketball team
with DeMarcus.

05:21.404 --> 05:23.364
It was hard enough for me to come forward.

05:23.448 --> 05:24.741
He's definitely not gonna...

05:25.116 --> 05:26.159
That would be bad. No.

05:29.662 --> 05:30.955
Well, I was with Chloe.

05:31.039 --> 05:32.915
-I feel like she told you that already.
-Yeah.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.710
Like, I was there with her
and she said that she saw the card,

05:35.793 --> 05:37.420
but, you know, I saw it, too.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.964
But it wasn't
like what you guys think it was.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.592
It wasn't the Turd Burglar card.
It was, um...

05:43.134 --> 05:45.094
[chuckles] Have you ever been to the...

05:45.595 --> 05:47.263
the Yummy Swirl Yogurt place?

05:47.722 --> 05:48.806
-I don't think--
-You know--

05:48.890 --> 05:50.058
-You've never been there?
-No.

05:50.141 --> 05:53.436
They hand out these little punch cards,
and you get, like, seven you get one free.

05:53.519 --> 05:55.313
It was that card. Right?

05:55.396 --> 05:57.774
And it looks like it's got
a chocolate swirl on it

05:57.857 --> 05:58.941
and it looks like shit.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.651
I mean, they don't really realize that,

06:00.735 --> 06:02.653
but everyone else--
like, it looks like shit.

06:03.905 --> 06:05.740
So it doesn't look anything
like this card?

06:05.823 --> 06:07.950
No, it's funny,
because it does look like this...

06:08.368 --> 06:11.079
[Peter] Instead of purple,
It's more of a deep blue,

06:11.162 --> 06:13.247
and there are no googly eyes.

06:13.331 --> 06:17.085
But the yogurt swirl does look
like the Turd Burglar's avatar:

06:17.543 --> 06:19.295
a tight coil of poop.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.256
Are you saying that because you're
on the basketball team with DeMarcus?

06:23.591 --> 06:25.843
No. No, I saw--

06:25.927 --> 06:26.928
I promise you,

06:28.054 --> 06:29.055
I saw the yogurt.

06:31.015 --> 06:33.476
And Gonzo said it was open
just for a second, so you could see-

06:33.559 --> 06:34.936
-No.
-What?

06:35.019 --> 06:37.355
No, he left it open
until his drink dropped.

06:37.772 --> 06:38.648
Really.

06:38.898 --> 06:41.317
It was just staring back at me
the entire time.

06:42.568 --> 06:43.945
But you can see what we're saying.

06:44.028 --> 06:46.280
Like, these cards look, like,
scarily alike.

06:46.364 --> 06:48.991
I see. I can understand.

06:49.075 --> 06:49.909
Okay, look.

06:49.992 --> 06:53.496
The Yummy Swirl card
does not have googly eyes.

06:53.579 --> 06:54.872
-Right?
-Yes.

06:55.331 --> 06:56.165
And I...

06:56.249 --> 06:58.501
I was staring at it
for a really long time.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.336
And I know those eyes.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.047
Those are the Turd Burglar eyes.

07:03.339 --> 07:05.716
If what Chloe is saying is true,

07:06.217 --> 07:08.553
then it looks really bad for DeMarcus.

07:09.053 --> 07:10.847
Yeah, that'd be the smoking gun evidence.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.140
Exactly.

07:12.223 --> 07:14.851
So, if she saw it in the wallet,
then DeMarcus is the Turd Burglar.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.066
[Peter] Two conflicting memories
of the same event.

07:22.525 --> 07:25.445
Different in the smallest,
most damning of details.

07:26.362 --> 07:29.532
There's no way of knowing
which version of the story is the truth.

07:29.866 --> 07:32.326
But if DeMarcus did commit
the poop crimes,

07:32.452 --> 07:33.953
and Kevin is innocent,

07:34.537 --> 07:35.788
why would DeMarcus do it?

07:36.456 --> 07:38.833
Does he have something against
the student body?

07:39.375 --> 07:41.752
Is it possible he feels like an outsider,

07:42.044 --> 07:42.962
like Kevin?

07:44.005 --> 07:46.007
[footsteps, shoes squeaking]

07:46.632 --> 07:48.759
-[Lou] Oh.
-[DeMarcus] Let's go!

07:48.926 --> 07:50.303
Yeah!

07:50.928 --> 07:52.472
[Lou] Ah!

07:53.764 --> 07:55.224
-[Lou] Oh!
-[DeMarcus] Yeah.

07:55.641 --> 07:57.560
Holy shit. Netflix, what's up, bro?

07:57.643 --> 07:58.936
[Peter] Hi. Peter-- Ow.

08:00.271 --> 08:02.064
[all] One, two, three, break!

08:03.399 --> 08:05.651
Vandal boys. What's up, man?
I heard y'all was coming.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.487
[Peter] You grew up
in Rainier Beach, correct?

08:07.904 --> 08:09.614
You been reading my Wikipedia, huh?

08:09.697 --> 08:12.366
Shout out to all the homies
in Rainier Beach. We out here. Yeah.

08:12.450 --> 08:13.993
Netflix, baby. [chuckles]

08:14.952 --> 08:16.579
[Peter] So, you drive about like, what,

08:16.662 --> 08:20.958
maybe like 40 minutes to a town
that is really different from your own.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.377
-[DeMarcus] Yeah.
-Do you feel like a bit of an outsider?

08:23.461 --> 08:25.171
Hell no, man. Fuck that.

08:25.254 --> 08:28.257
A lot of kids, they be saying Bellevue
is bougie and all that,

08:28.341 --> 08:29.300
but it's tight.

08:29.383 --> 08:31.135
I like all the people here.
Like, watch this.

08:31.219 --> 08:33.471
Hey, Squeak! Come here, man.

08:34.722 --> 08:35.806
Hustle up, baby.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.267
This my man Squeak.
We look real different, right?

08:38.351 --> 08:40.686
But this still my man. It don't matter.

08:40.770 --> 08:43.189
I'm no more important to this team
than the rest of these guys.

08:43.272 --> 08:46.108
Even though I might score 31,
12 rebounds, just nasty,

08:46.192 --> 08:49.779
Squeak might get-- What you be scoring?
Like two free throws?

08:49.862 --> 08:52.323
Squeak is still just as important as I am.

08:52.406 --> 08:53.282
You feel me?

08:53.366 --> 08:56.244
Like, sometimes, low-key,
I'll be wondering why he play basketball,

08:56.327 --> 08:57.578
'cause he not that good.

08:57.662 --> 08:59.747
I think his mom probably signed him up
or something.

08:59.830 --> 09:01.958
Like for college,
he be needing sports but whatever.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.293
Get the hell out of here, Squeak.
God damn, man!

09:04.585 --> 09:06.963
Squeak want that camera time.
But, yeah, that's my man.

09:08.339 --> 09:12.009
[Peter] And so you don't feel any sort
of a different class system at all?

09:12.093 --> 09:14.554
[DeMarcus] Nah, if anything,
I'm in, like, a higher class.

09:14.637 --> 09:15.846
I don't approach it like that.

09:15.930 --> 09:18.182
Like, I look down at people with love.

09:18.432 --> 09:19.517
Straight up.

09:22.478 --> 09:24.855
[Mascot Boy] DeMarcus and Lou
are actually pretty great guys.

09:24.939 --> 09:28.192
You'd think they'd be like Bill Ryan
or Andy Gold on the lacrosse team,

09:28.276 --> 09:30.945
but they're not complete assholes.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.281
Yo, this my main man Lou right here.

09:33.364 --> 09:36.367
You know what it is,
most assists on the team, most passes.

09:36.450 --> 09:39.120
I mean, he inbound the ball,
I take it forecourt and I score

09:39.203 --> 09:41.247
-but they count it as an assist for him.
-Whatever.

09:41.330 --> 09:43.874
A dime a dime.
I give it to you, you make the shit.

09:44.792 --> 09:47.545
[DeMarcus] That's my man.
I wouldn't do anything without this dude.

09:47.628 --> 09:49.297
He the brains behind the future empire.

09:49.380 --> 09:51.007
-Straight up.
-I hoop, he do marketing,

09:51.090 --> 09:52.341
all type of crazy stuff.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.302
Like the whole violin thing,
I came up with that.

09:54.385 --> 09:56.012
-Yup.
-I played violin in fifth grade.

09:56.095 --> 09:58.889
-I was like, "Bro, that'd be tight."
-Yeah. Like, just sing 'em to sleep.

09:58.973 --> 10:00.850
-'Cause they be crying all the time.
-Whining.

10:00.933 --> 10:03.686
He was like, "Yo, just play the violin."
I thought, "That's nasty!"

10:03.769 --> 10:05.855
Since then I been playing the violin.
It just catch on.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.861
These are my people. This is my world.

10:13.237 --> 10:14.405
Hey!

10:15.197 --> 10:16.574
That's my boy Spinach.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.117
I mean, I love the school.

10:18.200 --> 10:21.495
I love the people and the people love me.
I feel like I'm friends with everybody.

10:22.371 --> 10:25.583
Each handshake kind of represents
my relationship with that person

10:25.666 --> 10:27.084
and part of who that person is.

10:27.168 --> 10:28.294
This my man Asian Josh.

10:28.377 --> 10:30.921
He really Mexican, though.
That's crazy. Get to class, bro.

10:31.005 --> 10:33.174
I like to bring out their insecurities

10:33.257 --> 10:35.301
and make them more secure
with their handshake.

10:35.384 --> 10:37.678
Two-tops, butterfly, pinkie promise.

10:37.762 --> 10:38.929
Shh, don't tell nobody.

10:39.472 --> 10:42.391
She in theater. She's really creative.
She made up that handshake actually.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.352
A lot of people that's cool,
they try to be cool,

10:44.435 --> 10:45.478
and that ain't really cool.

10:45.561 --> 10:47.355
But being cool with being a weirdo,

10:47.563 --> 10:49.315
I think that's super cool.

10:49.398 --> 10:50.566
Hey, what's up, man!

10:50.650 --> 10:53.110
Like Big Head Ed. His head is so big.

10:53.653 --> 10:54.820
But he's cool with it.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.906
Boy, that boy head big as shit.

10:56.989 --> 10:58.783
He don't try to hide his head
and it's like,

10:58.866 --> 11:01.035
you gotta accept and respect Big Head Ed.

11:01.118 --> 11:01.952
[doorknob rattles]

11:02.036 --> 11:03.954
Sister Patty Cakes, how you doing?

11:04.038 --> 11:04.997
I'm good, how are you?

11:05.081 --> 11:08.125
I think handshakes and nicknames,

11:08.292 --> 11:09.502
I think they do the same thing,

11:09.585 --> 11:12.254
they serve the same purpose
of making people feel more comfortable

11:12.338 --> 11:13.714
and making 'em feel special.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.466
Remember, jelly at the end.

11:15.549 --> 11:16.926
-Jelly?
-Finesse.

11:17.385 --> 11:18.386
You know what it is?

11:19.595 --> 11:22.306
It's like every handshake
is like a McNugget.

11:22.556 --> 11:24.016
You know, it's completely unique.

11:25.643 --> 11:28.854
[Sam] Well, I don't think
every McNugget is completely unique.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.232
I think there's only, like,
four shapes, actually.

11:31.315 --> 11:32.191
For real?

11:32.274 --> 11:33.776
Yeah, they only come in four shapes.

11:33.984 --> 11:35.236
[Sam] I just don't see a motive.

11:36.070 --> 11:38.447
You know, he gets along
with everybody at the school.

11:38.864 --> 11:41.242
So, why would he want to commit

11:41.325 --> 11:42.243
any of the poop crimes?

11:42.326 --> 11:44.912
He wouldn't be doing this to get back
at the school, you know?

11:44.995 --> 11:47.331
But maybe we're looking at it wrong.
Look, pay attention.

11:47.832 --> 11:51.627
The police made it seem like this
was some dark, vengeful crime,

11:51.711 --> 11:54.672
that Kevin was trying to get back
at the school for years of bullying.

11:54.964 --> 11:58.592
He wanted to shit all over the school
because of the Shit Stain McClain.

11:58.676 --> 12:02.179
But what if the motive is as simple
as a prank?

12:02.430 --> 12:05.307
What if this is just DeMarcus
thinking that poop is funny?

12:06.058 --> 12:06.892
Poop is funny.

12:07.601 --> 12:10.020
Exactly, that works for this motive.

12:10.813 --> 12:13.107
[Peter] It seems a little elaborate
to just be a prank.

12:13.190 --> 12:14.525
[Sam] It is elaborate,

12:14.859 --> 12:18.612
but it's not the first time St. Bernardine
dealt with such an intricate prank.

12:19.113 --> 12:20.781
And more importantly,

12:20.865 --> 12:25.119
it's not the first time a star athlete
has been accused of pulling one off.

12:25.786 --> 12:27.538
Sir Fuxalot was hilarious.

12:27.621 --> 12:29.582
Nobody knew what happened
to the mascot costume.

12:29.665 --> 12:30.708
It just disappeared

12:30.791 --> 12:33.335
and somebody just started posting signs
all over the school.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.839
[girl] When the costume went missing,
we knew we were screwed.

12:36.922 --> 12:39.341
We had the biggest competition
of the year that weekend.

12:39.425 --> 12:42.470
We had to rent this cheap Halloween
knight costume.

12:43.637 --> 12:45.931
I'm pretty sure that's why
we didn't place that year.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.808
The cheerleaders got all butthurt
about it.

12:47.892 --> 12:50.352
Especially Paige Burton.
She flipped her shit.

12:54.064 --> 12:55.858
That's when the costume
showed up online.

12:55.941 --> 12:59.153
Somebody took the mascot costume
and started going around

12:59.236 --> 13:01.489
and started taking pictures
and posting them on Instagram.

13:02.865 --> 13:05.034
All of the posts were directed
at Paige Burton.

13:05.117 --> 13:08.454
[Peter] "I'm depressed, drunk,
and horny for thee, Paige.

13:08.537 --> 13:10.998
#lookatmypurpleboner."

13:11.123 --> 13:13.209
Yeah, the faculty said
they didn't know who did it,

13:13.292 --> 13:14.919
but they knew.

13:15.002 --> 13:16.462
We knew it had to be Perry.

13:16.837 --> 13:20.090
Who else would Photoshop Paige Burton's
face next to a purple dildo?

13:20.424 --> 13:23.010
Paige was pissed.
This thing went on for weeks.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.763
Like, what could she do about it?
It was Perry.

13:26.347 --> 13:27.640
[Peter] Perry Coleman,

13:27.723 --> 13:31.101
St. Bernardine's top basketball prospect
from 2016.

13:31.519 --> 13:32.853
Everybody knew it was Perry,

13:32.937 --> 13:35.606
but nobody called him out on it.

13:36.690 --> 13:39.819
[Peter] Not only did Perry face
no repercussions for his prank,

13:40.402 --> 13:41.821
he was revered for it.

13:42.655 --> 13:45.115
[DeMarcus] That shit was next level,
you feel me?

13:45.199 --> 13:48.702
Like, who puts a big dick
on a mascot costume?

13:48.786 --> 13:50.246
That shit is so funny.

13:50.329 --> 13:52.122
He was always thinking of stuff
like that, man.

13:52.206 --> 13:55.626
Like, that dude is probably the funniest
motherfucker I ever met.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.504
[Peter] DeMarcus idolizes Perry.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.422
He wants to be just like him.

14:00.965 --> 14:04.426
DeMarcus would like and comment
on the Sir Fuxalot Instagram,

14:04.635 --> 14:07.763
then two years later,
Perry would like and comment

14:07.847 --> 14:09.765
on the Turd Burglar Instagram.

14:10.516 --> 14:14.103
Is it possible that DeMarcus'
motive for the Turd Burglar

14:14.186 --> 14:15.813
is no different than Perry's?

14:16.438 --> 14:19.441
Simply a prank he knew he'd get away with?

14:20.150 --> 14:23.988
If St. Bernardine is a school
that turns a blind eye to its athletes,

14:24.572 --> 14:26.156
what else went overlooked?

14:27.074 --> 14:28.909
When do privileges and freedoms

14:29.451 --> 14:30.619
become free rein?

14:31.453 --> 14:34.248
DeMarcus can go anywhere he wants
in this school.

14:34.331 --> 14:35.958
He has more access than anyone.

14:37.459 --> 14:40.462
Yeah, no, DeMarcus is real tight
with the cafeteria staff.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.923
He gets free food, whatever.
They all love him.

14:43.007 --> 14:44.550
We'll hook him up a little bit.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.969
You know, 'cause we came
from the same place, so,

14:47.344 --> 14:48.679
I have to look out for him.

14:48.762 --> 14:49.847
He's a good kid.

14:49.930 --> 14:51.891
He wished my boy a happy birthday
last year.

14:51.974 --> 14:54.435
Happy birthday.
Hopefully, one day you can grow up

14:54.518 --> 14:57.062
and make chicken fingers
just as good as your dad.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.940
Yo, this motherfucker right here
make the greatest chicken nuggets,

15:00.024 --> 15:01.275
the best I ever had.

15:01.358 --> 15:03.861
You know? Ay, I apologize for cussing,

15:03.944 --> 15:07.406
but one day you gon' learn it anyway,
so that's my gift from me to you.

15:07.489 --> 15:09.241
Fuck it, happy birthday, bro. Turn up.

15:09.325 --> 15:10.951
-Happy birthday, baby boy.
-Yeah.

15:11.285 --> 15:13.662
He's got more access to that place
than anyone.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.414
Doesn't matter. Open, closed...

15:15.497 --> 15:17.166
He kind of gets whatever he wants.

15:17.249 --> 15:20.169
[Peter] The police claimed
that Kevin snuck into the kitchen

15:20.252 --> 15:22.421
through the back door
during the fire alarm,

15:22.504 --> 15:24.423
but DeMarcus wouldn't
have had to sneak at all.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.384
Thanks to his relationship
with the lunch staff,

15:28.135 --> 15:30.679
DeMarcus could have
walked right through the front.

15:30.763 --> 15:34.642
-Saint...
-[all] Bernie!

15:34.725 --> 15:35.935
Fuck yeah!

15:36.685 --> 15:38.270
My bad. Heck yeah!

15:38.354 --> 15:39.772
[laughter, cheering]

15:39.855 --> 15:42.733
[Peter] Could DeMarcus' status
have also given him access

15:42.816 --> 15:45.444
to the launchers? And a front row seat

15:45.736 --> 15:47.071
to another poop crime?

15:47.696 --> 15:49.281
Oh, yeah!

15:49.365 --> 15:50.574
[Chloe] The T-shirt launchers,

15:50.658 --> 15:52.701
they're in the locker room,
the athletics locker room,

15:52.785 --> 15:53.911
right off the main gym.

15:54.161 --> 15:56.997
It's not the locker room for phys-ed
or anything else.

15:57.081 --> 15:59.500
You have to be an athlete
to get into that locker room.

16:00.167 --> 16:01.627
[guy] DeMarcus is always practicing.

16:01.710 --> 16:04.088
Before school, after school, free periods.

16:04.546 --> 16:08.258
[Chloe] Of course DeMarcus had access.
Every athlete does.

16:08.676 --> 16:11.095
But you know who doesn't? Kevin.

16:12.471 --> 16:16.308
[birds chirping, airplane whooshes]

16:19.269 --> 16:23.691
[Kevin] We now approach the end
of my 200-yard radius.

16:23.774 --> 16:26.986
So I'm either at home
with my sister and my grandmother,

16:27.069 --> 16:31.573
or here, at the 24 Stop.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.117
[inhales]

16:33.200 --> 16:35.577
-I spat. So what? Oh.
-Thanks.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.204
[Kevin] Imagine seeing me

16:37.287 --> 16:40.290
in the basketball locker room
before the pep rally.

16:40.374 --> 16:42.584
I-I... The Fruit Ninja.

16:44.169 --> 16:45.504
Kevin McClain.

16:45.754 --> 16:49.049
[stuttering] There was not one witness
saying that they saw

16:49.133 --> 16:51.760
Kevin McClain in the locker room.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.805
Don't you think that I would be noticed?

16:54.888 --> 16:59.018
It would be like seeing DeMarcus
at the Philharmonic.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.645
[Peter] And Kevin has a point.

17:02.062 --> 17:04.773
There's no question that the gym
is a home to DeMarcus.

17:05.357 --> 17:08.110
But what about Ms. Montgomery's
English classroom?

17:08.736 --> 17:10.863
Would he get special treatment there, too?

17:11.155 --> 17:13.949
Well, we know that DeMarcus
and Ms. Montgomery

17:14.033 --> 17:15.367
have a history together.

17:15.451 --> 17:16.869
-[Peter] Because of the poem.
-Yes.

17:18.162 --> 17:20.289
[Chloe] So, DeMarcus
wrote a poem last year.

17:20.456 --> 17:22.833
[chuckles] Jesus, that poem.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.044
[Lil K] DeMarcus named his poem

17:25.127 --> 17:28.756
"Out of Bounds: A Baller's Promise."

17:29.339 --> 17:30.924
"Through the hoop, through the hole

17:31.842 --> 17:33.427
And that is my truth

17:34.636 --> 17:35.888
The ball is my soul"

17:36.805 --> 17:40.517
That poem was closer to Dr. Seuss

17:40.601 --> 17:41.852
than it was to...

17:45.481 --> 17:47.357
a more serious poet.

17:48.317 --> 17:49.568
"You may not be pretty

17:50.444 --> 17:51.862
Or have lips to kiss

17:52.196 --> 17:54.114
But when you slip through that hoop"

17:54.740 --> 17:56.742
"It feels like pure bliss"

17:57.034 --> 18:00.162
Ms. Montgomery is, like,
obsessed with DeMarcus.

18:00.245 --> 18:02.956
I think of myself as Sandra Bullock
in The Blind Side.

18:03.540 --> 18:04.792
Um...

18:04.875 --> 18:06.794
And just being so connected

18:07.252 --> 18:09.338
[inhales] with my students,

18:10.130 --> 18:12.758
the way Sandra was connected with, um...

18:13.217 --> 18:16.845
ah, the black kid in that movie.

18:17.554 --> 18:20.182
He was great. Love him.

18:20.265 --> 18:23.352
So, she published it in the school
newspaper without asking him.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.106
[Chloe] I honestly felt bad for him.

18:27.523 --> 18:29.024
How could you not?

18:29.108 --> 18:30.609
People started to post it online,

18:30.692 --> 18:32.486
then other schools started to see it.

18:33.195 --> 18:36.365
Everybody got their hands on it.
I'm talking Hendricken, La Salle.

18:36.448 --> 18:40.327
And the whole fuckin' student section
would chant it during his free throws.

18:40.410 --> 18:42.621
Through the hoop!
Through the hole!

18:42.704 --> 18:44.623
The net is my truth!
The ball is my soul!

18:44.706 --> 18:47.292
It was insane.
It got a little out of hand.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.211
The net is my truth!
The ball is my soul!

18:49.294 --> 18:51.255
[cheers, applause]

18:51.338 --> 18:53.465
[whooping]

18:55.008 --> 18:57.219
I don't really got a problem
with Ms. Montgomery.

18:57.970 --> 19:01.014
But I low-key feel like she shouldn't
have shared that poem.

19:01.431 --> 19:04.059
You know what I mean?
That shit was supposed to be private.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.395
But she let everybody see the poem.

19:06.728 --> 19:09.439
First off, I really don't even
do homework,

19:09.523 --> 19:11.900
so when I decided to do that,
I thought it would be fun.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.945
I really didn't put a lot into it,
but it was my first poem ever.

19:15.028 --> 19:17.656
I feel like Shakespeare's first poem
was probably trash, too.

19:17.739 --> 19:19.408
My first poem was
probably better than his.

19:19.491 --> 19:20.909
And look who he grew up to be.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.036
Like, one of the most famous
white people ever.

19:23.120 --> 19:27.291
I felt bad the other kids weren't
mature enough to appreciate his poem,

19:27.374 --> 19:28.917
and it was my fault.

19:29.459 --> 19:31.545
So now I let him use my classroom.

19:31.628 --> 19:34.882
You know, when he needs to nap
or listen to music.

19:35.215 --> 19:38.010
I've actually grown to like
some of his music.

19:38.552 --> 19:41.013
I can always tell DeMarcus
is in her classroom,

19:41.638 --> 19:43.932
-'cause I can hear Migos playing.
-[door thumps shut]

19:44.016 --> 19:47.102
[Peter] DeMarcus clearly had access
to Ms. Montgomery's room,

19:47.561 --> 19:49.021
and it's a recurring theme.

19:49.104 --> 19:52.649
The Turd Burglar committed
three crimes in three rooms

19:53.066 --> 19:55.402
where DeMarcus Tillman
had special privileges.

20:01.074 --> 20:04.286
Was DeMarcus ever questioned
regarding the Turd Burglar crimes?

20:06.371 --> 20:07.706
You're asking me if

20:08.332 --> 20:10.459
our star basketball player was

20:11.084 --> 20:13.629
questioned for the Turd Burglar crimes?

20:13.712 --> 20:14.546
No.

20:14.630 --> 20:17.466
Well, it's just his access
is almost unparalleled--

20:17.549 --> 20:21.053
DeMarcus, he doesn't have time
to fool around and play pranks.

20:21.470 --> 20:22.304
I know his schedule.

20:22.387 --> 20:25.015
He's either in the classroom
or on the court practicing.

20:26.475 --> 20:29.436
Yeah, but where was he
during the fire drill on November 6th?

20:29.519 --> 20:30.646
He was with me.

20:32.272 --> 20:34.566
And what about the lunch on November 10th?

20:34.650 --> 20:35.484
With me.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.612
And the lunch on the 14th?

20:38.695 --> 20:41.281
With me and the rest of the players.

20:43.867 --> 20:45.535
[Peter] If Coach Devlin is right,

20:45.702 --> 20:48.372
if DeMarcus hasn't missed
a single practice at lunch

20:48.455 --> 20:50.499
and was with Devlin during the fire drill,

20:51.166 --> 20:54.628
then there's no way DeMarcus
could have committed any of these crimes.

20:54.962 --> 20:57.422
The lemonade was tainted
during the fire drill.

20:57.839 --> 21:00.926
Ms. Montgomery's class
was only unattended at lunch.

21:01.426 --> 21:04.012
And the T-shirt cannons
would have had to have been loaded

21:04.096 --> 21:06.556
right before the pep rally during lunch.

21:07.140 --> 21:09.476
So if what Coach Devlin is saying
is accurate,

21:09.810 --> 21:12.104
then DeMarcus has a rock-solid alibi

21:12.562 --> 21:13.897
for all three crimes.

21:14.648 --> 21:17.776
One that's corroborated
by a faculty member.

21:19.945 --> 21:23.615
Of course Coach Devlin is DeMarcus' alibi.

21:23.699 --> 21:24.783
He's lying.

21:25.492 --> 21:30.205
[stutters] DeMarcus is
Coach Devlin's golden goose.

21:30.747 --> 21:34.334
I do not go to an academic institution
with a basketball program.

21:34.418 --> 21:40.090
I attend a basketball business
with an academic facade.

21:41.258 --> 21:42.801
[Peter] It's a bold accusation,

21:43.468 --> 21:44.970
but could there be truth in it?

21:45.762 --> 21:49.266
St. Bernardine does pull in a lot of money
from its basketball program,

21:49.725 --> 21:52.561
but would the administration
actively cover for an athlete

21:52.644 --> 21:54.229
to save their revenue stream?

21:55.022 --> 21:57.816
All at the expense
of a student like Kevin?

21:59.901 --> 22:02.529
Athletics are important at St. Bernardine,

22:03.155 --> 22:06.366
but you have to remember
that athletics helps with donations,

22:06.450 --> 22:07.826
it helps with enrollment.

22:08.160 --> 22:11.371
We wouldn't have these great facilities
here at St. Bernardine

22:11.455 --> 22:13.540
without the successful athletics program.

22:13.915 --> 22:17.419
But our curriculum
is one of the toughest in the state.

22:17.753 --> 22:19.171
We have a saying.

22:19.254 --> 22:22.299
It's, "Greatness on the field,
excellence in the classroom."

22:22.549 --> 22:24.634
"Greatness on the field,
excellence in the classroom"?

22:25.469 --> 22:26.595
It's fuckin' bullshit.

22:26.678 --> 22:30.599
[Peter] DeMarcus's grades
jumped dramatically at St. Bernardine.

22:30.682 --> 22:34.019
He went from a 2.04 GPA
at Deer River Junior High...

22:34.102 --> 22:36.396
to a 3.41 at St. Bernie.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.815
I mean, the athletes have it so easy here.

22:39.649 --> 22:42.903
Like, they're taking zoology
while we're doing microbiology.

22:43.528 --> 22:46.323
A lot of people say zoology is bullshit.
I disagree.

22:46.406 --> 22:48.200
Think about other classes, like math,

22:48.283 --> 22:50.202
where you gotta deal
with imaginary numbers.

22:50.494 --> 22:52.788
They're not real, bro. They're imaginary.

22:52.871 --> 22:54.915
That's pointless.
It's irrelevant to my life.

22:54.998 --> 22:57.209
But zoology is different.

22:57.667 --> 23:00.670
Like, for instance, did you know
dolphins weren't fish?

23:01.880 --> 23:04.257
Dolphins are mammals, bro. That's crazy.

23:04.341 --> 23:06.343
Like, they're just like us,
they just swim.

23:06.426 --> 23:08.387
And they have, like, smoother skin.

23:09.137 --> 23:11.598
I mean, athletes have it easy
at St. Bernie's,

23:11.681 --> 23:13.350
but DeMarcus...

23:13.892 --> 23:15.977
No, he can get away
with anything he wants.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.187
[phone chiming]

23:17.270 --> 23:18.105
Hello?

23:18.688 --> 23:21.483
I'm sorry, my bad. I gotta take this.

23:23.735 --> 23:26.029
If he wants a hall pass,
he just goes to Devlin.

23:26.655 --> 23:29.116
Late slip, Devlin. Detention, Devlin.

23:29.199 --> 23:31.076
I mean, the guy wields so much power.

23:32.828 --> 23:34.871
Honestly, the school would fire
the principal

23:34.955 --> 23:36.581
before they would fire Devlin.

23:37.374 --> 23:39.126
He brings in all the money.

23:39.960 --> 23:42.671
And because of that,
all the athletes are treated different.

23:43.004 --> 23:44.214
Guys like DeMarcus,

23:45.298 --> 23:46.842
they live above the law.

23:49.469 --> 23:51.263
If an athlete does something stupid,

23:51.638 --> 23:53.598
they just get a warning and a pass.

23:53.932 --> 23:56.268
But if someone else
that's not an athlete does it,

23:56.351 --> 23:59.396
it's a detention,
or they get suspended or expelled.

24:00.480 --> 24:03.191
[guy] Look, Perry Coleman
only got away with Sir Fuxalot

24:03.275 --> 24:04.943
because he was an athlete.

24:05.026 --> 24:08.071
Like, look what happened
to Grayson Wentz that same year.

24:08.613 --> 24:09.656
A few years back,

24:09.739 --> 24:12.075
the school forgot to block Twitter
in the computer lab,

24:12.159 --> 24:14.995
so a bunch of kids were logging on
and tweeting during class.

24:16.371 --> 24:19.374
The thing is, a bunch of dumbasses
left their accounts logged in.

24:19.458 --> 24:22.335
[Lil K] If you leave your shit logged in,
people are gonna fuck with it.

24:22.419 --> 24:24.463
It's like when you fall asleep
with your shoes on,

24:24.546 --> 24:27.299
people are gonna draw a dick on your face.

24:27.924 --> 24:30.886
Grayson? I guess Grayson fucked
with one too many people

24:30.969 --> 24:32.804
and the administration got pissed.

24:32.888 --> 24:34.723
I had discovered Grayson, um...

24:34.806 --> 24:39.102
who, you know, had typically been
a pretty troubled kid, uh...

24:39.436 --> 24:42.147
I discovered he was tweeting
some pretty unsavory stuff.

24:42.731 --> 24:44.608
[Peter] A tweet from March 2016,

24:45.150 --> 24:46.651
from his classmate's account.

24:47.360 --> 24:48.987
"My dick's gonna fall off.

24:49.446 --> 24:53.325
@jessrodriguez99 infected me
with crotch goblins.

24:53.783 --> 24:55.410
#chlamyds."

24:56.328 --> 24:59.080
As you probably are aware,
these computers are supposed to be used

24:59.164 --> 25:00.874
for nothing but schoolwork.

25:00.957 --> 25:04.336
You know, least of all,
cyberbullying and...

25:04.794 --> 25:05.795
And, so yeah,

25:05.879 --> 25:09.007
I turned that case over
to the disciplinary council,

25:09.674 --> 25:12.469
and sadly for Grayson, uh...

25:12.552 --> 25:13.428
he was expelled.

25:15.680 --> 25:18.808
Grayson's a weirdo, but I couldn't believe
they actually expelled him

25:18.892 --> 25:20.769
over a few tweets about "chlamyds."

25:23.813 --> 25:26.858
[Peter] So, do you mind telling me
your story and exactly how you...

25:27.526 --> 25:28.360
ended up here.

25:28.443 --> 25:31.446
Yeah, sure. I made a joke

25:32.155 --> 25:33.198
through Twitter

25:33.823 --> 25:36.493
to Jess Rodriguez and they kicked me out
of the fucking school,

25:37.327 --> 25:39.538
Mr. Gesualdi, the computer teacher,
knew it was me

25:39.621 --> 25:43.416
'cause I did it from the computer lab,
and ta-da, here I am,

25:43.875 --> 25:46.253
kicked out and livin' large.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.090
[Peter] Once the fraudulent tweets

25:50.173 --> 25:52.175
were brought
to the administration's attention,

25:52.259 --> 25:55.136
swift action was taken
against Grayson Wentz.

25:55.220 --> 25:56.805
He was expelled a week later

25:57.389 --> 26:00.433
What Grayson did was irredeemable,

26:01.268 --> 26:04.854
but it's exactly what Perry Coleman
did to Paige Burton.

26:07.023 --> 26:07.983
[sighs]

26:08.066 --> 26:10.485
People treated Sir Fuxalot
like it was so funny.

26:10.986 --> 26:13.989
Hmm... It just wasn't funny to me.

26:14.072 --> 26:16.199
Every day in the hallway,
people are shouting,

26:16.283 --> 26:17.784
"When you gonna fuck the knight?"

26:17.867 --> 26:20.203
Or, "You really blow the Duxbury Dolphin?"

26:22.872 --> 26:24.040
It was humiliating.

26:25.041 --> 26:27.460
I go to the administration
and I tell what Perry did

26:27.544 --> 26:28.837
and nothing happened.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.463
And I filed multiple complaints

26:30.547 --> 26:32.716
and Perry never even got questioned.

26:33.675 --> 26:34.634
Nobody cared.

26:36.052 --> 26:37.804
[Kevin] What happened to Perry?

26:37.887 --> 26:40.557
A pat on the back
and a platitude about boys being boys.

26:40.640 --> 26:44.603
See, that is the difference
between being a star athlete

26:44.686 --> 26:47.606
and just your run-of-the-mill
St. Bernardine student.

26:48.064 --> 26:50.817
If we could throw a ball through a hoop,

26:50.900 --> 26:52.819
perhaps it would be a different story.

26:54.613 --> 26:57.365
Do you feel like maybe they treated you
differently than Perry Coleman?

26:57.449 --> 26:58.700
[chuckles]

26:58.783 --> 27:00.452
I mean, do you know what he did to her?

27:00.869 --> 27:02.871
-It's kinda like fucked up, you know?
-Yeah.

27:02.954 --> 27:05.874
I did, like, three or four tweets
and I'm expelled.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.877
He does, like, months of shit
to this girl.

27:10.128 --> 27:12.631
And he ends up at UCLA.
I mean... [chuckles]

27:13.089 --> 27:14.883
St. Bernardine is all about basketball.

27:15.842 --> 27:17.719
It's the lifeblood of the school.

27:18.970 --> 27:21.598
DeMarcus Tillman can get away with murder.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.060
Guys like Kevin and me,

27:25.477 --> 27:27.020
well, we're easy scapegoats.

27:28.813 --> 27:31.149
That's why they end up at UCLA,

27:31.941 --> 27:34.486
and we end up with ankle bracelets,

27:35.403 --> 27:37.322
and a job at the fucking Kirkland Mall.

27:39.741 --> 27:42.327
[Peter] Is there a double standard
at St. Bernardine?

27:43.662 --> 27:46.247
Would the administration go as far
as covering up a crime

27:46.915 --> 27:49.167
committed by their most valuable asset?

27:50.085 --> 27:53.213
Would they let an innocent man
take the fall?

27:54.756 --> 27:57.008
So I wanted
to sit down with you because...

28:00.095 --> 28:01.846
we have reason to believe
that Kevin McClain

28:01.930 --> 28:04.641
-may not be the Turd Burglar.
-Oh, shit.

28:06.059 --> 28:08.687
Isn't it true that Perry Coleman was a...

28:09.270 --> 28:11.773
was a pretty notorious prankster

28:11.856 --> 28:13.650
at St. Bernardine while he was here?

28:13.733 --> 28:17.320
Wait. You suggesting
that fucking Perry did it?

28:17.404 --> 28:18.738
You know he lives in LA?

28:19.322 --> 28:21.574
I don't believe that Perry Coleman did it.

28:22.909 --> 28:23.910
It's just...

28:24.661 --> 28:26.496
it seems to me that...

28:27.247 --> 28:30.917
Perry almost set a precedent
that athletes pull off pranks,

28:31.334 --> 28:33.128
and that, you know...

28:33.670 --> 28:35.714
it seems as if you look up to him,

28:35.797 --> 28:38.591
you guys even share the same
basketball number.

28:39.384 --> 28:40.802
[chuckles]

28:41.302 --> 28:42.846
[laughing] Are you--

28:43.221 --> 28:45.932
You're suggesting
that I'm the Turd Burglar?

28:46.474 --> 28:49.686
I'm just asking a few questions,
that's all.

28:49.769 --> 28:50.979
Okay.

28:51.062 --> 28:53.565
Are you a fan of Yummy Swirl Yogurt?

28:55.483 --> 28:58.111
It's fucking yogurt. Yeah. What about it?

28:59.362 --> 29:01.156
So... [stuttering]

29:01.239 --> 29:03.450
So you like Yummy--
Have you ever been there?

29:03.533 --> 29:05.702
Bro, why are you asking me about yogurt?

29:05.785 --> 29:07.245
You want to get to the crime.

29:07.662 --> 29:10.123
Kevin said he did it,
you don't believe he did it.

29:10.498 --> 29:13.376
You're bringing up Perry,
but you don't believe he did it.

29:13.626 --> 29:16.379
And for no reason at all,
you believe I did it.

29:17.172 --> 29:20.133
And for some reason
we're talking about yogurt.

29:20.216 --> 29:22.719
Shit, bro, I'm done
with your little yogurt talk.

29:23.052 --> 29:25.054
I like yogurt.
Is that what you want to hear?

29:25.138 --> 29:26.097
All flavors.

29:26.431 --> 29:28.725
Pistachio. Cookies and cream.

29:28.808 --> 29:30.560
-[Lou laughs]
-Potato salad.

29:31.144 --> 29:34.731
Put the fuckin' circle balls
with the little fruit flavors,

29:34.814 --> 29:36.149
but it's just juice in the middle.

29:36.232 --> 29:37.317
All that stuff, bro.

29:37.400 --> 29:38.943
I'm a yogurt connoisseur!

29:39.486 --> 29:42.280
[Peter] What is life like
for someone like DeMarcus Tillman?

29:43.531 --> 29:47.035
Someone who's been larger-than-life
since the day he was born.

29:48.244 --> 29:50.872
Someone who's been showered
with praise and attention

29:50.955 --> 29:52.540
for as long as he can remember.

29:53.708 --> 29:55.877
Who is treated like he can do no wrong.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.212
Hello?

29:57.295 --> 29:59.380
[Peter] As if his actions
have no consequences.

30:00.673 --> 30:02.884
Someone who walks between the raindrops.

30:03.927 --> 30:06.221
-[crowd cheers]
-What does that do to you mentally?

30:07.096 --> 30:08.139
Would you feel

30:08.681 --> 30:09.641
untouchable?

30:10.683 --> 30:12.352
How far would you push your luck?

30:12.435 --> 30:15.730
[DeMarcus] Don't prod me.
I'm sorry for being mean to you.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.732
I'm sensitive sometimes.

30:17.816 --> 30:20.276
You know what, if you need anything,
let me know.

30:20.944 --> 30:22.612
I ain't going nowhere, Pete.

30:22.695 --> 30:24.280
[Peter] If you were untouchable...

30:24.989 --> 30:28.034
-I'm going nowhere.
-...how bold would you be?

30:30.119 --> 30:31.329
[phone buzzes]
