00:01.301 --> 00:03.428
<i>Previously on "Heartland"...</i>

00:03.536 --> 00:06.403
You know, the old ranch hands
never had it this good.

00:06.506 --> 00:07.495
You will never ask me

00:07.607 --> 00:09.973
to take a group of city slickers
on a trail ride.

00:10.577 --> 00:14.035
He is totally droolwon'thy.
But you're not his type.

00:14.214 --> 00:16.375
But I definitely am.

00:16.483 --> 00:17.916
You got no idea what Amy can do.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.680
Well, I fully intend to find out.
Count on it.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.017
There was only one thing
that I ever wanted to say to you,

00:25.125 --> 00:26.820
but I wasrt sure
you still wanted to hear it.

00:28.361 --> 00:29.089
Ty.

00:31.531 --> 00:33.021
Maybe we should take a break.

00:33.133 --> 00:35.761
Maybe we should get married.

00:54.854 --> 00:55.980
Oh, my God!

00:58.792 --> 01:01.920
Uh... Uh, hey.

01:02.028 --> 01:05.224
Sorry, I know I'm trespassing.

01:05.364 --> 01:06.263
Um...

01:06.366 --> 01:09.392
But I didn't think anybody
would be around.

01:09.502 --> 01:11.470
It's so early.

01:13.206 --> 01:15.538
Hey, why don't you be a gentleman

01:15.642 --> 01:17.940
and turn your back on me
and ride away?

01:19.579 --> 01:21.046
No problem.

01:21.147 --> 01:23.240
You might want to check
for bloodsuckers, though.

01:23.349 --> 01:24.782
Plenty of them in the pond.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.852
Huh?

01:37.197 --> 01:38.994
But I have guests arriving.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.123
This morning.

01:40.233 --> 01:42.997
Yeah, you're one of the reasons
they're coming.

01:43.103 --> 01:46.664
Of course it's a big opportunity.
I underst...

01:47.273 --> 01:48.604
Okay.

01:49.542 --> 01:52.272
I understand. Bye.

01:53.680 --> 01:57.343
Nadine Lipchuck
just canceled on us for Oprah.

01:57.450 --> 02:00.112
Can you believe that?
It's a disaster.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.880
- It'll all be fine.
- No, it won't, Grandpa.

02:02.989 --> 02:05.787
I've only ever read about trust
and self-esteem exercises.

02:05.892 --> 02:07.154
I've never actually done them.

02:07.293 --> 02:09.693
There's a reason
I hired Nadine Lipchuck,

02:09.795 --> 02:11.957
the famous equine facilitator
with a best seller.

02:12.065 --> 02:14.260
Personally, I think her book's
a bunch of crap.

02:14.367 --> 02:17.962
How can you say that?
She's the preeminent voice in E.G.E.

02:18.104 --> 02:18.763
What?

02:25.378 --> 02:28.370
makes you
"one with your authentic self'?

02:28.515 --> 02:30.449
Exactly. Crap.

02:30.550 --> 02:34.213
So when are these guests
of yours arriving?

02:40.527 --> 02:42.859
This is such a cool
little country store.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.464
Can you imagine Lou shoveling poo?

02:45.565 --> 02:47.032
In her spike heels and Prada suit?

02:47.133 --> 02:48.225
I'd pay money to see that.

02:48.334 --> 02:50.165
We did. We are.

02:50.270 --> 02:51.965
I can't believe
just as she's fast-tracking

02:52.071 --> 02:53.129
up the corporate ladder,

02:53.239 --> 02:54.866
that's when she disappears
to run a dude ranch

02:54.974 --> 02:56.066
in the middle of nowhere.

02:56.176 --> 02:59.168
Whatever Lou does,
you can be sure it's to the max.

02:59.279 --> 03:04.376
We roomed together doing our MBAs,
and she is total type A.

03:04.484 --> 03:06.315
I will not fail with this, Amy.

03:08.121 --> 03:10.646
You're right.
Who needs Nadine Lipchuck?

03:10.757 --> 03:12.281
You can do these exercises.

03:12.392 --> 03:14.189
I know you can.
You'll be great at it.

03:14.294 --> 03:15.727
Okay, why did you convince

03:15.828 --> 03:17.591
your New York work buddies
to come anyway?

03:17.697 --> 03:20.530
Because they paid full price
even when I offered them a discount.

03:20.633 --> 03:23.101
And they know anybody
who is anybody in New York.

03:23.203 --> 03:26.730
They'll spread word about this place
faster than any website.

03:26.839 --> 03:29.103
Plus, they eat up stuff
like Nadine's book.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.404
They love anything to do
with self-help.

03:31.511 --> 03:32.876
"A horse is a mirror

03:33.012 --> 03:34.639
of your inner strengths
and weaknesses."

03:34.747 --> 03:36.908
"Discover what attractor energies
you may possess."

03:37.050 --> 03:38.244
I'll get them in a saddle,

03:38.351 --> 03:41.013
but I'm not going into all
this inner-productivity garbage.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.587
Leave the garbage to me.

03:44.257 --> 03:46.020
Did you travel all the horses
to the paddock?

03:46.125 --> 03:47.752
They have all been delivered.

03:47.927 --> 03:50.088
Must have been a good ride.
The morning was really nice.

03:50.196 --> 03:53.723
Yeah, it was.
It was a good view.

03:53.833 --> 03:55.801
A really good view.

04:16.221 --> 04:18.122
Oh, my God.

04:18.224 --> 04:20.624
Hey, there.
How are you ladies doing today?

04:23.129 --> 04:25.097
Howdy.

04:26.299 --> 04:27.766
I think your guests have arrived.

04:32.438 --> 04:33.427
What have I done?

04:52.892 --> 04:55.326

Hey!

05:20.486 --> 05:21.714
Lou!

05:22.255 --> 05:24.018
- You made it.
- Lou!

05:24.123 --> 05:25.112
Welcome.

05:25.224 --> 05:26.452
Oh, you look amazing.

05:26.559 --> 05:27.548
Oh, you!

05:27.727 --> 05:29.490
- Have you lost weight?
- Your hair looks amazing.

05:29.595 --> 05:31.358
I brought gifts.
New York in a bag.

05:31.464 --> 05:32.761
You didn't.

05:32.865 --> 05:35.231
The bagels from Zabar's.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.461
Espresso.

05:36.569 --> 05:38.366
<i>The Village Voice.</i>

05:38.504 --> 05:40.096
Oh, I'm so sorry.

05:40.206 --> 05:42.174
Lou, this is Mackenzie Hutton.

05:42.275 --> 05:45.176
She joined Strickland & Cooke
right after you left.

05:45.278 --> 05:48.270
- I've heard so much about you.
- It's nice to meet you, too.

05:48.381 --> 05:51.475
Listen, ladies,
I have some bad news.

05:51.584 --> 05:54.109
Nadine Lipchuck.
She bailed on us for Oprah.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.753
No worries.

05:56.689 --> 05:57.747
We came to see you.

05:57.857 --> 05:59.848
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

06:00.860 --> 06:04.352
Um, sorry,
but this is really dirty.

06:04.464 --> 06:06.227
Could we put my stuff
in the front seat?

06:06.332 --> 06:07.924
Not if someone's gonna drive.

06:09.068 --> 06:11.502
Tell you what, though.

06:12.138 --> 06:14.072
Welcome to ride in the back
if you want.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.900
No, thanks.

06:20.847 --> 06:22.405
Hey, everybody.

06:23.015 --> 06:24.448
Good to see you.

06:26.185 --> 06:27.584
Good to see you.

06:29.255 --> 06:31.120
Who's the Marlboro Man hottie?

06:31.324 --> 06:33.189
That's my dad.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.459
And who's he?

06:36.496 --> 06:38.123
Oh, that's my grandpa.

06:39.432 --> 06:42.230
There is something to be said
about your gene pool.

06:46.939 --> 06:48.270
Ladies!

06:48.374 --> 06:50.433
We're ready to head out
if you guys are.

06:50.543 --> 06:51.942
Absolutely.

06:52.044 --> 06:53.033
The men here.

06:53.646 --> 06:57.241
No wonder you never came back
to New York.

07:06.659 --> 07:08.286
Oh, my God, Lou.

07:08.394 --> 07:10.259
It's so beautiful here.

07:11.497 --> 07:14.364
It's gorgeous.
So early Ralph Lauren.

07:15.201 --> 07:16.566
You know, I'm so proud of you.

07:16.669 --> 07:17.499
Who would have thought

07:17.603 --> 07:18.228
you'd turn out to be

07:18.337 --> 07:19.827
such an entrepreneur?

07:19.939 --> 07:21.429
I need to use a washroom.

07:21.541 --> 07:23.600
It's just right over there.

07:23.709 --> 07:26.576
Oh. Fun.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.148
You promised me you'd give me
another jumping lesson.

07:36.255 --> 07:37.688
Copper's already all saddled up.

07:37.790 --> 07:40.554
I can't, Mallory. I promised Lou
I'd help her with something.

07:40.660 --> 07:42.992
You know, I could blackmail you
into keeping your promise.

07:43.095 --> 07:44.084
Excuse me?

07:44.230 --> 07:45.424
I heard a rumor.

07:45.565 --> 07:46.657
What kind of a rumor?

07:46.766 --> 07:49.530
That someone kissed someone
at the cattle drive.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.569
Jake saw you and Ty.

07:51.671 --> 07:53.502
Just for the record,
are you guys together?

07:53.606 --> 07:55.198
Just for the record, we're not.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.003
- Why?
- 'Cause.

07:57.109 --> 07:58.906
Because he hasn't mentioned
the kiss yet

07:59.011 --> 08:01.309
and you wish he would have?

08:01.948 --> 08:04.007
I've got to figure out
what to do with these women.

08:04.116 --> 08:07.552
Then I'll just take Copper
and practice with him all by myself.

08:07.653 --> 08:08.381
Okay. Sure.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.251
Just lunge him over the round poles
like I showed you.

08:10.356 --> 08:12.790
He doesn't get the poles.
He just trips over them.

08:12.892 --> 08:15.019
Well, he'll get it eventually.

08:15.127 --> 08:16.492
Can I take Spartan?

08:16.662 --> 08:17.151
No.

08:17.263 --> 08:18.525
Look, I'll give you
a lesson tomorrow

08:18.631 --> 08:20.189
after the divas leave
for their trail ride.

08:20.299 --> 08:21.789
Fine.

08:35.181 --> 08:36.044
AMY: Hey.

08:36.215 --> 08:37.113
Hey.

08:37.216 --> 08:38.547
Is Caleb around?

08:38.717 --> 08:40.582
He actually just took some guests
out to the cabins.

08:40.686 --> 08:42.881
Oh, right.
Hillbilly haven.

08:43.856 --> 08:45.653
He should be back any minute.

08:45.758 --> 08:47.191
I'll just wait here.

08:47.293 --> 08:49.193
Okay. Whatever.

08:56.002 --> 08:57.026
Hey, guys.

08:57.136 --> 08:59.161
We're ready.

08:59.338 --> 09:00.862
There are days when I love my job.

09:08.047 --> 09:10.447
Yeah. There are days.

09:15.488 --> 09:17.115
Put your eyes back in your heads.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.123
Copper.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.394
The pole is right
in front of your face.

09:29.502 --> 09:32.767
The trick is to step over it.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.140
Girls, we are ready to ride.

09:40.246 --> 09:41.907
Bring on the horses.

09:43.549 --> 09:44.846
Do we get to share?

09:44.951 --> 09:46.282
- A horse?
- Uh-huh.

09:46.385 --> 09:48.148
- No. We each get our own.
- Okay.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.313
- Shouldrt be too hard.
- Yee-haw!

09:50.423 --> 09:52.288
- Well, have a good time.
- Yeah.

09:52.391 --> 09:55.724
Just down here
to the horses, guys.

09:57.930 --> 10:00.797
- Have a good day.
- I will.

10:08.908 --> 10:10.307
This is gonna be

10:10.409 --> 10:13.435
the most amazing three days
of your lives.

10:13.546 --> 10:16.913
You are gonna change and grow
in ways that...

10:17.016 --> 10:19.075
well, in ways
that you never imagined.

10:20.353 --> 10:23.322
Working with horses is gonna
teach you about yourselves

10:23.422 --> 10:25.390
and each other.

10:25.524 --> 10:28.459
And give you tools,
invaluable tools,

10:28.561 --> 10:29.789
to help you with your careers.

10:30.796 --> 10:32.764
- Corporately.
- Corporately.

10:32.865 --> 10:35.959
So, let's get started.

10:36.569 --> 10:38.867
What a load of crap.

10:39.405 --> 10:41.566
No way.

10:42.775 --> 10:45.175
Forget it, Lou.
We didn't pay you to shovel poop.

10:45.277 --> 10:48.735
It is not about shoveling poop, okay?
It's about team skills.

10:48.848 --> 10:51.146
You need to work together
to get the cleanup done.

10:51.250 --> 10:55.653
As quickly as possible.
I'm timing you.

10:55.755 --> 10:56.949
Go.

10:58.824 --> 10:59.916
You shovel.

11:00.026 --> 11:01.550
You work the wheelbarrow.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.022
I'll dump it.

11:08.334 --> 11:10.495
Eww, it got on my Jimmy Choos.

11:10.636 --> 11:12.160
Hurry up, it's a test.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.704
Good, good.

11:16.809 --> 11:17.673
Just shovel.

11:20.246 --> 11:22.840
Choosing your horse
calls upon long-buried instincts

11:22.948 --> 11:24.472
you never knew you had.

11:24.617 --> 11:27.552
Instincts that will allow you
to match your inner self

11:27.653 --> 11:30.417
with your equine soul mate.

11:31.290 --> 11:32.484
Can we just pick a damn horse?

11:34.293 --> 11:36.853
That one's mine.
He's gorgeous.

11:36.996 --> 11:39.396
I think he's mine.

11:39.999 --> 11:43.901
I want that one.
It looks nice and calm and safe.

11:45.137 --> 11:48.334
- Oh, they're friends.
- That's so cute.

11:48.441 --> 11:50.466
Yeah, well,
Betty's as blind as a bat.

11:50.576 --> 11:52.203
That's why she's sticking
so close to Slick.

11:52.344 --> 11:54.710
Oh, really?
You're pretty funny.

11:55.881 --> 11:58.042
Come on, Slick.
Come here.

11:58.951 --> 12:00.009
Stay still.

12:00.152 --> 12:01.676
What's wrong with him?

12:01.821 --> 12:04.790
Go easy. You're the boss.

12:05.825 --> 12:07.884
Don't laugh, okay?
This is hard. Just let me...

12:10.896 --> 12:11.555
Well done.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.232
All right, Lauren.

12:22.408 --> 12:23.875
Come here, Betty.

12:24.043 --> 12:25.408
Come on.

12:25.511 --> 12:28.139
He's not gonna come to you
like your Lhasa Apso.

12:28.247 --> 12:30.772
What the hell is a Lhasa Apso?

12:35.654 --> 12:36.643
I did it.

12:37.723 --> 12:38.451
Good job.

12:42.394 --> 12:43.861
Good boy.

12:47.733 --> 12:49.564
Ooh, yeah.

13:01.981 --> 13:04.313
Does Mackenzie know
that Betty's blind?

13:04.416 --> 13:05.542
Caleb told her.

13:05.651 --> 13:07.516
- And she's fine with that?
- Yeah.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.609
Wow.

13:08.754 --> 13:11.689
She seems like such a perfectionist.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.850
Maybe she's
already becoming more...

13:13.959 --> 13:15.449
Authentic?

13:16.262 --> 13:17.490
This is great, Lou.

13:17.596 --> 13:20.394
You sure you've never
ridden before?

13:20.499 --> 13:21.193
I like this.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.530
They're all really getting into it,
don't you think?

13:23.636 --> 13:24.796
Yeah.

13:27.039 --> 13:30.099
Mackenzie. Breathe.

13:30.209 --> 13:31.540
No, I'm working out of the office.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.339
This is a corporate retreat.
There should be...

13:33.512 --> 13:36.106
- Well, you're coming in and out.
- Hey, John.

13:36.282 --> 13:38.477
No, that's two points away
from where we need to be.

13:38.584 --> 13:39.573
Hello?

13:39.718 --> 13:41.982
That'll be finalized by tomorrow.

13:42.087 --> 13:43.782
You're coming in and out.

13:43.889 --> 13:46.983
John, it's me.
I've left you a million messages.

13:47.092 --> 13:48.787
Hello?

13:49.562 --> 13:51.257
Can you hear me now?

13:51.363 --> 13:55.197
- Hello?
- You're an assistant, honey.

13:56.669 --> 14:00.628
Remember Marlene from Accounts?
She's dating Mr. Strickland.

14:00.739 --> 14:03.207
No way.
He's married.

14:03.309 --> 14:05.072
Thank you.
Not anymore.

14:05.177 --> 14:07.145
- And guess who got fired?
- Who?

14:07.246 --> 14:09.111
Reg Malinski.

14:09.281 --> 14:12.307
Oh, but he could do no wrong.
That's crazy.

14:12.484 --> 14:14.145
Insider trading.
Huge scandal.

14:14.253 --> 14:15.277
Roz Higley got his job.

14:15.387 --> 14:17.821
- Oh, and the private washroom.
- And the corner office.

14:17.923 --> 14:19.914
Yeah, well, Roz isn't the only one
on her way up.

14:20.025 --> 14:21.788
Lauren just got a promotion.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.921
Really? You didn't tell me.

14:25.097 --> 14:27.190
Well, I... I just...

14:27.299 --> 14:29.995
You didn't know?
Yeah, she got your old job.

14:32.538 --> 14:33.835
To Lauren.

14:34.006 --> 14:35.166
Cheers.

14:36.208 --> 14:37.106
Cheers.

14:37.209 --> 14:40.201
I never expected to be pulling in
a six-figure income before I was 30.

14:41.447 --> 14:44.439
That is great.
Congratulations.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.415
Thank you.

14:49.321 --> 14:51.881
I'm gonna get some coffee.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.694
Mackenzie, you sure
you don't want some wine?

14:56.795 --> 14:58.729
Oh, no, thank you.
Unless you have organic.

14:58.831 --> 15:01.197
Not that I know of.

15:01.767 --> 15:03.064
Now, you didn't eat much.

15:03.202 --> 15:04.464
You can't be on a diet
in this house.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.538
I'm not on a diet.
I'm allergic.

15:06.639 --> 15:08.869
- Allergic to what?
- Everything.

15:08.974 --> 15:10.703
Dairy, white sugar, seafood, gluten.

15:10.809 --> 15:12.538
Everything I eat has to be organic.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.272
That must be tough.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.313
Oh, you can't imagine.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.747
It's not so bad.
I just eat a lot of vitamins.

15:18.851 --> 15:21.012
I couldn't swallow all those.
I'd gag.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.213
Well, you gals have to eat something.

15:23.322 --> 15:24.653
You need your strength
for the trail ride.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.486
Coffee, anyone?

15:26.592 --> 15:28.787
- No, not for me. No caffeine.
- Right.

15:28.961 --> 15:30.485
I have my own herbal teas.

15:32.097 --> 15:34.622
I'll just go boil some water.

15:34.733 --> 15:36.325
It aids her digestion.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.335
Not that she has anything to digest.

15:38.971 --> 15:40.302
Coffee here, please.

15:40.406 --> 15:43.671
Yes. Definitely.
There you go.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.437
- Thanks, Lou.
- No problem.

15:58.157 --> 16:02.856
Well, I think, as first days go,
that went pretty well for you.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.862
Yeah.

16:05.898 --> 16:09.356
Is something wrong?

16:10.336 --> 16:13.396
What the hell am I doing, Grandpa?

16:13.505 --> 16:16.770
I should be in New York.

16:18.944 --> 16:23.574
What if I've made the worst mistake
of my entire life?

16:26.251 --> 16:30.153
So it's gonna be great
to watch them ride off tomorrow.

16:30.255 --> 16:32.052
Yeah.

16:33.192 --> 16:35.160
Guess we'll have
this whole place to ourselves.

16:35.794 --> 16:37.955
Yeah, I guess.

16:39.531 --> 16:41.226
Hey, maybe I could...

16:41.367 --> 16:44.359
Maybe I could make us some dinner.

16:44.470 --> 16:46.461
Yeah. That would be cool.

16:48.273 --> 16:50.901
- Hey, Ty, can I ask you something?
- Sure.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.706
You know on the cattle drive...

16:53.812 --> 16:55.746
Did you mean it?

16:55.848 --> 16:57.179
The kiss.

16:58.350 --> 17:00.215
Of course I meant it.
I kissed you, didn't I?

17:01.453 --> 17:03.421
Okay.

17:03.522 --> 17:06.319
But just for the record.
You kissed me first.

17:06.425 --> 17:07.756
- No.
- I just kissed you back.

17:07.859 --> 17:10.420
- That's not how it happened.
- That's exactly how it happened.

17:10.529 --> 17:11.518
CALEB: Hey.

17:11.630 --> 17:14.326
How are we doing tonight?

17:15.901 --> 17:17.630
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

17:19.038 --> 17:20.699
You going on the ride tomorrow?

17:20.806 --> 17:22.501
Uh, no.

17:22.608 --> 17:23.801
Good.

17:23.909 --> 17:27.037
All Tim needs is another novice.

17:31.383 --> 17:34.409
- See you in the morning.
- Yeah.

17:46.999 --> 17:48.591
This looks amazing, Lou.

17:49.401 --> 17:51.266
Forget the diet.
I'm having bacon.

17:51.370 --> 17:52.701
I'm having everything.

17:52.805 --> 17:54.397
Since when do you cook?

17:54.506 --> 17:56.167
You could burn water
when we roomed together.

17:56.275 --> 17:57.970
Very funny.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.375
Enjoy.

18:00.646 --> 18:02.580
What's wrong with you?

18:02.681 --> 18:04.672
I have muscles hurting
I never knew I had.

18:04.783 --> 18:07.217
I know. I got out of bed
and almost fell.

18:07.352 --> 18:08.979
Is the water drinkable?

18:09.088 --> 18:11.318
- Yeah, it's from the well.
- Oh, my God. I'll boil it.

18:11.423 --> 18:13.118
Don't even get me started
on giardia infection.

18:13.225 --> 18:15.921
You would know... Where's
the nearest gluten-free bakery?

18:18.664 --> 18:21.827
Yeah, it's been in the family
for six generations.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.232
Those cabins
you girls are staying in...

18:24.336 --> 18:27.430
my granddad built those
for the ranch hands.

18:27.539 --> 18:29.769
My earliest memory is helping him.

18:31.009 --> 18:34.638
There's a rumor floating around

18:34.813 --> 18:38.408
that I was born out there
on a table.

18:39.818 --> 18:42.048
I heard you were
quite the rodeo champion.

18:42.154 --> 18:44.645
Oh, I might have won
a few things, I guess.

18:44.756 --> 18:46.314
He was a legend.

18:46.425 --> 18:49.826
Boy, that's when you know you're old,
when someone calls you a legend.

18:51.363 --> 18:52.762
Well, I should get a move on.

18:52.865 --> 18:54.355
The sun doesn't wait
for a working man.

18:54.466 --> 18:55.455
What? You're leaving?

18:55.567 --> 18:57.034
I thought you were coming
on the overnight.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.694
- Oh, you have to.
- Oh, no.

18:58.837 --> 19:00.998
No, I don't do trail rides.

19:01.173 --> 19:03.141
Or overnights.
It's his arthritis, you know?

19:07.146 --> 19:09.876
[Cell phone rings]

19:12.885 --> 19:13.579
Hey.

19:13.685 --> 19:16.950
Caleb, you better get over here.
We're getting ready to go.

19:17.089 --> 19:18.886
No, you cannot bail on me.

19:19.024 --> 19:20.787
Hello?

19:20.926 --> 19:22.416
Caleb?

19:25.130 --> 19:26.028
He's sick.

19:30.435 --> 19:31.493
- No.
- Grandpa, please.

19:31.637 --> 19:33.502
Just this one time.
Amy's not around.

19:33.605 --> 19:34.833
Remember our terms?

19:34.940 --> 19:36.874
We agreed
you would never ask me

19:36.975 --> 19:39.637
to take a bunch of city slickers
on a trail ride.

19:39.745 --> 19:41.906
I know.
But just this once, Grandpa.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.208
They love you.

19:43.315 --> 19:46.113
You're authentic.
You're the real thing.

19:46.218 --> 19:49.551
You are this ranch.
You are this countryside.

19:49.655 --> 19:51.486
Please.

19:54.359 --> 19:56.384
Grandpa.

19:59.898 --> 20:02.867
So just you and Ty left at home.

20:02.968 --> 20:04.333
Yeah.

20:04.436 --> 20:06.165
I think he's gonna make me dinner.

20:06.338 --> 20:08.499
Ooh. Maybe you'll have "the talk."

20:08.607 --> 20:09.869
That's what I'm afraid of.

20:09.975 --> 20:11.840
- Why?
- I don't know.

20:11.944 --> 20:13.935
[Cell phone rings]

20:15.747 --> 20:16.509
Hey, Lou.

20:18.784 --> 20:20.445
Okay. I'll be there.

20:20.552 --> 20:21.883
All right. Bye.

20:22.688 --> 20:24.747
Well, I may have to go
on the trail ride.

20:24.856 --> 20:26.050
Caleb's sick.

20:26.191 --> 20:27.180
No, he isn't.

20:27.292 --> 20:29.351
I dropped off an order
at Briar Ridge this morning,

20:29.461 --> 20:32.919
and he was pulling in
just as I was leaving.

20:38.870 --> 20:40.633
I might make a cowgirl
out of you yet.

20:40.739 --> 20:42.104
You think?

20:42.207 --> 20:44.232
Heck, even if I can't,
it'll be fun trying.

20:44.343 --> 20:46.868
Well, that's what I'm looking for...
a little fun.

20:48.280 --> 20:51.875
But you got the wrong saddle
and the wrong horse.

20:51.984 --> 20:54.544
No worries, though.
I got a friend with a real good pony.

20:54.653 --> 20:55.642
Yeah?

20:55.821 --> 20:57.584
Yeah, I'll give her a call.

20:57.723 --> 21:00.283
Her.

21:01.827 --> 21:04.887
Oh, look. It's Cowboy Ken
and Cowgirl Barbie.

21:04.997 --> 21:07.158
Ditched us for Ashley.
I'm gonna kill him.

21:07.633 --> 21:09.726
She's learning to barrel race?
I'll kill her.

21:10.335 --> 21:12.803
What's with the barrel racing?
I thought you hated rodeo.

21:12.904 --> 21:15.099
I changed my mind.
Rodeo's cool.

21:15.207 --> 21:17.004
And I've been told
I have a certain talent.

21:17.909 --> 21:21.003
It's bound to help me
in the rodeo queen contest.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.308
- You're entering?
- Why not?

21:23.415 --> 21:26.282
A little competition
never hurt anyone, right?

21:27.719 --> 21:30.153
So you're not doing the trail ride?

21:30.255 --> 21:32.120
You got enough guides.

21:32.224 --> 21:32.918
[Sighs]

21:33.025 --> 21:35.493
If I was Lou, I would so fire you.

21:35.594 --> 21:36.856
Come on, Amy.

21:41.166 --> 21:41.962
Hi, Lou.

21:43.235 --> 21:44.361
Yeah, I'll come.

21:44.536 --> 21:45.594
Okay, bye.

21:45.704 --> 21:47.171
So much for alone time with Ty.

21:47.773 --> 21:49.866
It's probably a good thing.

21:52.210 --> 21:54.337
So, you ready to see
some of the most beautiful country

21:54.446 --> 21:55.640
in the entire world?

21:55.747 --> 21:57.442
I'm about to show it to you.

21:57.549 --> 22:02.213
Oh, my God. He looks even better
now that I'm not jet-lagged.

22:05.290 --> 22:07.918
- So, I hear you're a man short?
- Yeah.

22:08.026 --> 22:09.755
Well, Amy's going,
which is good.

22:09.861 --> 22:11.886
And I'm trying to convince Grandpa
into coming.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.396
Oh, that'll be a big help.

22:13.532 --> 22:16.399
Dad, this has to be successful, okay?
And I need all the help I can get.

22:16.535 --> 22:19.663
I need cowboys
that can get on and off a horse.

22:19.771 --> 22:23.798
I'm all saddled up and ready.
How about you?

22:30.048 --> 22:31.982
Why are you taking Copper?
Take Spartan.

22:32.150 --> 22:35.381
Well, Spartars not really
a trail horse, Mallory.

22:35.487 --> 22:37.387
How am I supposed
to practice jumping?

22:37.489 --> 22:39.855
Well, I'll help you when I get back.

22:41.460 --> 22:42.950
So, you're going?

22:43.895 --> 22:46.159
Yeah. Yeah, Lou needs me.

22:46.264 --> 22:48.858
I was kind of looking forward
to that dinner.

22:48.967 --> 22:51.026
Me too. Another time?

22:51.803 --> 22:53.031
Sure.

22:53.138 --> 22:53.604
Okay.

22:56.608 --> 22:59.133
Okay. Everybody ready?

22:59.244 --> 23:02.008
Let's head on out.

23:02.614 --> 23:06.243
Come on, Jack.
Get a leg over.

23:20.732 --> 23:22.495
Happy trails.

23:32.477 --> 23:33.808
Hey, Ty, can you help me?

23:34.312 --> 23:35.643
With what?

23:35.747 --> 23:37.612
I need to know where the poles go
in the round pen.

23:37.783 --> 23:41.219
Uh... There's a plan
Amy used for Spartan.

23:41.319 --> 23:44.755
But well, Copper's on a ride,
so why don't you just relax?

23:44.856 --> 23:46.323
I got to go into town
if you want to come?

23:46.758 --> 23:47.952
No.

23:48.059 --> 23:52.052
All right, suit yourself.
I won't be long.

24:09.748 --> 24:12.512
Hey, Spartan.

24:19.691 --> 24:20.589
Yes.

24:20.725 --> 24:23.717
Little more like it.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.478
Yes!

24:49.721 --> 24:51.382
You're awesome!

24:51.490 --> 24:52.889
Totally awesome.

24:53.024 --> 24:54.218
Need to cool off?

24:54.326 --> 24:56.157
How about we go
for a trail ride?

24:56.261 --> 24:57.819
Come on.

25:08.974 --> 25:10.601
Amazing.

25:10.709 --> 25:12.904
Indescribable.

25:13.011 --> 25:15.036
Ow. There's mosquitoes.

25:15.146 --> 25:18.479
Look at them.
I think it's actually working.

25:18.583 --> 25:19.777
You did it.

25:19.885 --> 25:23.013
Hey, thanks for stepping in.

25:23.121 --> 25:25.282
No problem.

25:30.695 --> 25:32.993
How much further?

25:33.098 --> 25:34.292
Just over there.

25:34.399 --> 25:35.661
Oh, is that all?

25:35.767 --> 25:37.632
Oh, come on.

25:37.736 --> 25:40.227
It's won'th the trek.
I promise you.

25:40.338 --> 25:43.171
I'll hold you to that, cowboy.

25:51.249 --> 25:52.511
Kit Bailey.

25:52.617 --> 25:55.950
She's one of the best
barrel racers in Hudson.

25:58.723 --> 25:59.883
What's going on here?

26:00.725 --> 26:02.556
I'm entering a barrel-racing event.

26:03.828 --> 26:05.022
What are you thinking?

26:06.331 --> 26:07.525
Anyway, I forbid it.

26:07.632 --> 26:09.031
You're not gonna use
an expensive jumper

26:09.134 --> 26:10.192
for a rodeo stunt.

26:10.302 --> 26:14.033
I'm not.
I'm using that cow pony.

26:14.205 --> 26:17.197
Then you won't be needing Apollo.

26:18.376 --> 26:19.638
Mother!

26:20.245 --> 26:22.042
Mother!

26:25.050 --> 26:28.508
Got him warmed up for you.
Let me see you go around.

26:44.703 --> 26:47.604
Whoa, whoa! Go easy!

26:51.576 --> 26:53.441
Whoo!

26:54.913 --> 26:58.246
All right! Yeah!

26:59.818 --> 27:01.649
Heck, I've been competing
for two years,

27:01.753 --> 27:04.313
and you're gonna be
a real threat.

27:06.224 --> 27:07.691
You bet I am.

27:12.964 --> 27:14.591
Look at her.

27:14.699 --> 27:16.462
Doesrt it just make you sick?

27:16.568 --> 27:19.230
Perfect Lauren.
God, I ache.

27:19.337 --> 27:21.965
Yeah, it's pretty much
a form of torture.

27:22.073 --> 27:23.370
I'm hungry.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.568
You? Hungry?

27:25.677 --> 27:27.144
This is a different universe.

27:27.245 --> 27:28.769
How is it possible

27:28.880 --> 27:31.440
that not only do they not have
gluten-free bread

27:31.549 --> 27:33.608
but they don't even know
what it is?

27:33.718 --> 27:35.709
It's all I can do
not to gobble everything up.

27:35.820 --> 27:37.344
I mean, the food's incredible.

27:37.455 --> 27:39.480
At least you can eat it.

27:39.591 --> 27:42.651
Well, maybe if you didn't have
such a size-zero mentality,

27:42.761 --> 27:44.661
you might enjoy it, too.

27:44.763 --> 27:49.097
Excuse me, did you just call
my allergies psychosomatic?

27:49.200 --> 27:51.668
You said it, not me.
I mean...

27:51.770 --> 27:54.136
You just got to look
outside yourself.

27:54.873 --> 27:58.240
That's funny coming from you,
Miss Self-Centered.

27:58.343 --> 28:02.211
Okay. I'm just saying...

28:02.313 --> 28:04.213
Look around.
I mean, use your eyes.

28:04.315 --> 28:08.183
Have you ever seen anything like this
in your entire life?

28:08.286 --> 28:11.187
Not from Daddy's penthouse
on Central Park, that's for sure.

28:11.289 --> 28:12.688
Oh, that's nice.

28:12.791 --> 28:15.521
You know what?
Maybe we just need some time out.

28:15.627 --> 28:18.118
Come on, Betty. Let's go.

28:18.229 --> 28:20.493
Go! Go! Betty, let's go!

28:20.598 --> 28:22.566
How are you cowgirls doing?

28:22.667 --> 28:23.998
You know, fine.

28:24.102 --> 28:26.468
Except my horse
is stuck to hers like glue,

28:26.571 --> 28:28.266
and I would really like
some solitary.

28:28.373 --> 28:30.204
Well, that's because Betty's blind.

28:30.308 --> 28:32.208
So she likes to stick close
to Slick, you know?

28:35.947 --> 28:39.542
Wow. Caleb wasrt kidding.

28:39.718 --> 28:40.878
Oh, God.

28:40.985 --> 28:44.580
That is too funny.

29:06.644 --> 29:11.081
What do you think, Spartan?
You think we can jump it?

29:12.350 --> 29:15.979
The ground's soft.
Nothing too sharp.

29:18.556 --> 29:20.148
Spartan?

29:22.460 --> 29:23.757
Spartan!

29:25.730 --> 29:28.062
Spartan!

29:30.101 --> 29:31.659
Spartan!

29:32.270 --> 29:34.295
This can't be happening.

29:35.240 --> 29:37.970
Spartan!

29:38.510 --> 29:40.569
Spartan!

29:41.546 --> 29:43.138
Spartan!

29:44.415 --> 29:47.509
Thank goodness.
Stay there.

29:48.119 --> 29:49.780
Stay there.

29:50.622 --> 29:53.113
That was not cool.
Not cool at all.

29:53.224 --> 29:56.716
Better not tell anyone about this.
Promise?

29:56.828 --> 29:58.693
I was so worried about you.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.765
What where you thinking,
running off like that?

30:00.865 --> 30:03.425
You scared me.

30:08.940 --> 30:10.999
I can't believe you.

30:11.109 --> 30:12.838
- What?
- Well, look at you.

30:12.944 --> 30:16.880
You're the girl who'd rather
wear polyester than go camping.

30:16.981 --> 30:18.812
It's just my life now.

30:18.917 --> 30:20.782
Birthing foals.

30:20.885 --> 30:22.716
Sleeping under the stars.

30:22.821 --> 30:25.483
I love every minute of it.

30:25.623 --> 30:28.717
Lou, is there some way to turn
the fire up or something?

30:28.827 --> 30:31.853
- This is taking forever to boil.
- There's coffee already made.

30:31.963 --> 30:34.659
- I don't drink coffee.
- Right. Caffeine.

30:34.766 --> 30:37.530
I need this tea
for my digestive system.

30:37.635 --> 30:39.830
Have some bran buds.
That ought to do it.

30:45.810 --> 30:49.974
I found him like this.
Just lying down.

30:51.583 --> 30:54.051
- What's wrong with him?
- I don't know.

30:54.152 --> 30:55.779
Was he okay this afternoon?

30:55.954 --> 30:57.546
This afternoon?

30:58.489 --> 31:00.013
What?

31:01.025 --> 31:02.492
Ty, I did a terrible thing.

31:02.594 --> 31:04.152
What?

31:04.262 --> 31:06.696
I took Spartan for a ride
and I lost him,

31:06.798 --> 31:08.891
but only for a few minutes, really,

31:09.033 --> 31:10.432
and I found him
on the side of the road.

31:10.568 --> 31:11.535
What road?

31:11.703 --> 31:13.864
The back road to Big River.

31:13.972 --> 31:16.065
There were trucks out there
yesterday spraying, Mallory.

31:16.174 --> 31:17.368
Didrt you see the signs?

31:17.475 --> 31:18.339
No.

31:18.910 --> 31:20.935
Was he grazing?
Did he eat anything?

31:21.045 --> 31:24.014
No. Well, maybe just a little.

31:24.115 --> 31:26.845
He's got pesticide poisoning.
I need you to call Scott, okay?

31:26.951 --> 31:28.111
I'm sorry.

31:33.992 --> 31:35.983
Here it is, here it is...
16-year-old Appaloosa

31:36.094 --> 31:38.153
poisoned by eating grass
sprayed with pesticide. This is it.

31:38.296 --> 31:39.763
He keeps trying to lie down.

31:39.864 --> 31:41.695
Don't let him. Okay?
We need to keep him walking.

31:41.799 --> 31:43.562
I need to make a mixture
of charcoal and water,

31:43.668 --> 31:45.533
and we got to get it down his throat.

31:45.637 --> 31:47.730
- Did you call Scott?
- I had to leave a message.

31:50.008 --> 31:52.033
I don't know how we're gonna do this,
just the two of us.

31:52.644 --> 31:54.908
Is Caleb here?

32:02.587 --> 32:04.214
So, you enjoying yourself?

32:04.322 --> 32:06.916
Yeah, I am.

32:07.025 --> 32:09.391
Sort of, I mean...

32:09.494 --> 32:11.792
I must have looked pretty stupid
on that horse.

32:12.630 --> 32:16.191
Did you see me yesterday?
I couldn't even get up on one.

32:16.334 --> 32:18.234
My wife used to be
pretty philosophical

32:18.336 --> 32:19.735
about looking stupid.

32:19.837 --> 32:21.099
She had to be, married to me.

32:22.240 --> 32:24.674
She always said that looking stupid

32:24.776 --> 32:27.677
was a necessary step
to looking smart.

32:28.346 --> 32:29.677
How long were you married?

32:29.781 --> 32:31.942
A long time.

32:32.050 --> 32:33.574
Should have been longer.

32:33.685 --> 32:34.617
How about you?

32:34.719 --> 32:36.584
You got a boyfriend
back there in New York?

32:37.221 --> 32:38.620
No.

32:38.723 --> 32:40.452
No, not me.

32:40.558 --> 32:42.617
I've vowed never to get married.

32:42.727 --> 32:44.285
Now, why's that?

32:45.296 --> 32:46.957
Because I love my job.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.161
I don't see
why one excludes the other.

32:51.135 --> 32:52.625
Well...

32:52.737 --> 32:56.935
My parents are very... successful.

32:57.041 --> 33:00.272
And they expect the same
from me, too.

33:00.378 --> 33:01.970
So, I figure the only way
I can do that

33:02.080 --> 33:06.574
is by just staying focused
and maintaining control.

33:06.884 --> 33:08.317
Control is everything.

33:08.419 --> 33:09.443
Well, I don't know.

33:09.554 --> 33:11.954
Nothing wrong with stepping
on the gas every once in a while.

33:12.056 --> 33:13.717
I sure did at your age.

33:15.026 --> 33:17.824
Well, I can't afford that.

33:18.663 --> 33:21.063
I bet you can.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.730
So you're single?
A guy like you?

33:24.836 --> 33:27.236
Well, it's...

33:27.338 --> 33:29.329
It's a little more complicated
than that.

33:29.440 --> 33:31.738
What about you?

33:31.843 --> 33:35.006
Me? I've been going out
with the same guy for five years.

33:35.980 --> 33:36.947
Sounds serious.

33:37.081 --> 33:38.139
It is. We are.

33:38.249 --> 33:42.652
But I want to get that corner office
before I ever get married.

33:42.754 --> 33:45.484
And kids are definitely on hold.

33:45.623 --> 33:47.853
Well, you don't have to worry
about marriage or children.

33:47.959 --> 33:50.587
Your boyfriend is
a complete commitment-phobe.

33:50.695 --> 33:53.220
- No, he's not.
- Uh-huh.

33:53.331 --> 33:55.299
John has a career, too.
We both have goals.

33:55.400 --> 33:56.924
Yada, yada, yada.
Let's face it.

33:57.035 --> 34:00.471
We are great at our jobs
but not so great with men.

34:00.571 --> 34:02.766
Hey, who wants a marshmallow?

34:02.874 --> 34:04.569
I mean, I'm really happy
with my love life.

34:04.675 --> 34:06.666
That's because your fiancé
is crazier about you

34:06.778 --> 34:07.767
than you are about him.

34:07.879 --> 34:10.541
And that's fine if you're willing
to settle for that.

34:10.648 --> 34:13.446
Plus, he found you a nice apartment.
That's a perk.

34:13.551 --> 34:14.745
There's cake, too.

34:14.886 --> 34:17.184
You know, I'd rather marry
my real estate broker

34:17.288 --> 34:18.585
than be with the egocentric moron

34:18.790 --> 34:21.657
that you've wasted
your last five years with.

34:21.793 --> 34:23.283
That's time you'll never get back.

34:23.428 --> 34:25.793
I don't remember
you even having a boyfriend.

34:31.034 --> 34:32.195
Okay, so what is your story, Lou?

34:32.370 --> 34:35.668
You're quite the urban legend
at the office.

34:35.773 --> 34:38.139
Did you leave New York for love?

34:38.242 --> 34:40.402
- Urban legend?
- Yeah.

34:40.578 --> 34:43.775
I mean, you're all anybody wanted
to talk about when I started.

34:44.581 --> 34:46.572
- Really?
- Yeah, come on. You know.

34:46.684 --> 34:49.175
You're like the crazy lady
who threw it all away

34:49.286 --> 34:50.754
for New Age ranching.

34:51.422 --> 34:52.911
Crazy lady?

34:53.024 --> 34:55.219
Well, speaking of crazy,

34:55.326 --> 34:58.386
if I hear you say one more word
about your inability

34:58.529 --> 35:00.929
to eat or function
like a normal human being,

35:01.032 --> 35:01.930
I'm gonna hurl.

35:02.233 --> 35:04.758
And if you think working
in an office is hard,

35:04.869 --> 35:06.996
you should try my lifestyle
for a day.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.403
Ranching makes investment banking
look like a joke.

35:10.308 --> 35:11.297
Go, Lou.

35:12.343 --> 35:15.471
Oh, my God. You're such
a pompous, two-faced know-it-all.

35:15.580 --> 35:20.142
If you had any idea how much
I loathe working with you...

35:20.251 --> 35:23.652
how much I loathe working
with both of you...

35:39.604 --> 35:42.471
You see, this is
what equine training is all about.

35:42.640 --> 35:46.201
It releases all your inner truths,
anxieties, and vulnerabilities.

35:46.310 --> 35:47.607
Well, bedtime.

35:47.712 --> 35:49.009
Good idea.

35:56.554 --> 35:59.387
That worked out well.

36:06.731 --> 36:09.564
TY: Keep him moving.

36:11.002 --> 36:13.129
Mallory. Here, help me with this.

36:13.237 --> 36:15.467
Pour it in there.
Hold the funnel.

36:15.573 --> 36:16.335
Got it?

36:16.908 --> 36:18.603
Okay.

36:19.310 --> 36:22.837
Okay, guys, we got to move fast,
or his kidneys are gonna fail.

36:23.214 --> 36:25.273
Lift his head up.

36:25.383 --> 36:26.873
Keep him calm.

36:26.984 --> 36:28.781
Ready?

36:32.523 --> 36:33.990
No. He won't do it.

36:34.158 --> 36:35.090
TY: Easy.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.855
Easy, boy. Easy.

36:37.962 --> 36:38.986
[Horse neighs]

36:39.363 --> 36:40.159
Come on.

36:40.298 --> 36:41.731
Ready? Let's try it again.

36:41.832 --> 36:43.094
Easy, easy.

36:52.343 --> 36:54.504
You got it down.

36:54.612 --> 36:56.546
Good boy.

36:57.682 --> 36:59.946
- Pesticide poison.
- What can I do?

37:00.051 --> 37:01.575
TY: We got six more to go.

37:01.686 --> 37:03.244
Here, grab this.

37:08.459 --> 37:09.858
- Got it?
- Let's go.

37:09.961 --> 37:12.862
All right.
Hold his head up again.

37:12.964 --> 37:15.432
All right.
Ready, Spartan?

37:15.566 --> 37:16.897
Good boy.

37:17.001 --> 37:18.935
Good boy, good boy.

37:19.070 --> 37:19.968
Here we go.

37:20.104 --> 37:21.503
Yeah!

37:23.274 --> 37:26.038
Maybe they're right.

37:26.143 --> 37:30.409
God, everything is
so much clearer out here.

37:31.082 --> 37:32.447
That's what they say.

37:33.351 --> 37:35.945
Maybe I should break up
with my boyfriend.

37:36.053 --> 37:39.750
Well, you got to do
what you think is right for you.

37:41.459 --> 37:44.690
I know what's right for me.

37:45.763 --> 37:47.253
And when I do, I go for it.

37:52.503 --> 37:53.970
Whoa!

37:54.105 --> 37:55.595
Whoa.

37:56.874 --> 38:00.776
You're a beautiful girl, but...

38:00.878 --> 38:02.812
No.

38:10.554 --> 38:11.543
Hello?

38:11.689 --> 38:14.852
Lauren, that's my dad.
What were you thinking?

38:15.660 --> 38:17.855
I'm such an idiot.

38:17.962 --> 38:21.329
Oh, God.
I'm a total loser.

38:22.133 --> 38:24.363
Yeah, right, Lauren.
You're such a loser.

38:24.468 --> 38:25.127
I am.

38:25.269 --> 38:27.669
You all think I'm so perfect.
I'm not.

38:27.772 --> 38:30.969
My life is far from perfect.

38:31.075 --> 38:35.535
Lauren, stop.

38:37.782 --> 38:38.976
I hate my job.

38:39.417 --> 38:42.648
This promotion?
I'm terrified.

38:42.753 --> 38:45.415
They should have given it to Nicole.
She's way more qualified.

38:45.523 --> 38:49.357
But the boss likes me.
He's always hitting on me.

38:50.795 --> 38:54.128
And Mackenzie doesn't miss a chance
to stab me in the back.

38:56.233 --> 38:59.327
And John.
He's cheating on me.

38:59.437 --> 39:00.665
No.

39:00.838 --> 39:02.032
Yeah, he's cheating on me,

39:02.139 --> 39:04.300
and we're both pretending
it's not happening.

39:04.408 --> 39:07.241
It's just all so horrible, Lou.

39:07.345 --> 39:08.972
Come here.

39:09.080 --> 39:11.514
You are so lucky.
You have no idea.

39:12.850 --> 39:15.318
I'm not so lucky, Lauren.

39:15.419 --> 39:17.683
I'm not having things
so great either.

39:19.090 --> 39:21.024
Remember I wrote to you
about Scott?

39:21.125 --> 39:22.353
The vet?

39:22.493 --> 39:23.858
Yeah.

39:23.961 --> 39:25.986
We broke up.

39:26.097 --> 39:28.065
Why? I thought he adored you.

39:28.165 --> 39:30.099
Yeah, I did, too.

39:30.201 --> 39:32.226
So, I asked him to marry me.

39:36.841 --> 39:38.570
You did what?

39:38.676 --> 39:41.201
It was stupid.

39:41.312 --> 39:43.940
And he said no,

39:44.048 --> 39:50.920
that we should wait,
that he wasrt sure.

39:52.857 --> 39:55.291
How can he not be sure, Lauren?

39:55.393 --> 39:57.293
He's known me
since we were kids.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.955
We grew up together.

40:00.064 --> 40:01.861
He knows me.

40:01.966 --> 40:04.764
He loves me.

40:05.002 --> 40:08.438
Why isn't he sure?

40:09.373 --> 40:11.705
I've wrecked it.

40:12.810 --> 40:15.973
Why did I wreck it?

40:23.487 --> 40:26.479
You made the right diagnosis,
that's for sure.

40:26.590 --> 40:27.557
Is he okay?

40:28.292 --> 40:30.590
You probably saved his life.

40:30.694 --> 40:34.130
I'll do a follow-up, but I'd say
he's gonna make a full recovery.

40:34.231 --> 40:35.789
You guys were a team.

40:40.471 --> 40:42.268
Hey, it's okay.

40:42.807 --> 40:44.035
None of this would have happened

40:44.141 --> 40:45.631
if you hadrt bailed
on the trail ride.

40:50.114 --> 40:51.479
Hey.

40:51.582 --> 40:52.674
Thanks for your help.

40:52.783 --> 40:54.182
Yeah, I'm glad I was here.

40:54.351 --> 40:57.252
We seem to meet
under the weirdest circumstances.

40:57.755 --> 40:59.655
At least I had my clothes on
this time.

41:14.205 --> 41:16.935
Let's take them over here.

41:32.289 --> 41:34.484
I'm so sorry, Amy.
I'll make it up to you.

41:34.592 --> 41:36.685
I'll do all your chores.
I'll make your bed.

41:36.794 --> 41:37.920
Mallory, stop.

41:38.028 --> 41:40.724
Look, the good news is
that Spartars fine.

41:40.865 --> 41:41.889
The bad news is

41:41.999 --> 41:44.524
Ty's talking to that girl
like she's known him forever.

41:44.635 --> 41:46.193
You shouldn't have gone
on that ride.

41:46.303 --> 41:48.203
None of this
would have happened.

41:48.305 --> 41:51.035
- Oh, really?
- I swear.

41:51.942 --> 41:53.705
[Sighs]

42:04.288 --> 42:07.018
Hey, Lou. Come on in.

42:11.896 --> 42:13.955
LOU: Hey, guys.

42:14.765 --> 42:18.428
Listen, I need to apologize.

42:18.536 --> 42:20.197
I wasrt exactly ready.

42:20.337 --> 42:22.669
No, Lou. We should apologize.

42:22.773 --> 42:23.762
We were nightmares.

42:23.874 --> 42:25.341
You must be so glad
to get rid of us.

42:25.509 --> 42:27.773
I'm so sorry about everything.

42:27.878 --> 42:30.904
Lou, the whole experience
was amazing.

42:31.015 --> 42:32.380
So therapeutic.

42:33.350 --> 42:34.510
I'll never forget it.

42:34.618 --> 42:37.246
We're gonna tell
everyone we know about it.

42:40.958 --> 42:41.856
Thank you.

42:41.959 --> 42:44.359
Oh, my God!

42:47.398 --> 42:48.387
Come here.

43:04.415 --> 43:08.977
Do you wish you were in that car
on your way back to the Big Apple?

43:09.086 --> 43:11.213
No.

43:11.322 --> 43:14.155
I'm happy to be exactly where I am.

43:36.647 --> 43:38.410
Lou.

43:46.857 --> 43:49.189
LOU: Aww, that's a good one.

43:49.593 --> 43:50.821
Those are my girls.

43:50.928 --> 43:54.364
LISA: I don't know how you did it,
Lou, but you pulled it off.

43:54.465 --> 43:56.763
LOU: Yeah, I guess I did.

44:00.871 --> 44:03.431
Those girls
will never forget that trip.

44:03.374 --> 44:05.399
Neither will you, Grandpa.

44:05.509 --> 44:09.240
Oh, uh, Nicole says to say hi.

44:10.314 --> 44:13.374
Look at you,
just dripping with ladies.

44:13.484 --> 44:14.746
What can I say?

44:14.852 --> 44:18.310
I'm authentic.
I'm the real deal.

44:18.422 --> 44:20.982
I am this countryside.
Right, Lou?

44:22.993 --> 44:26.520
Wait, I think I'm also a legend.

44:26.664 --> 44:29.132
Right, Grandpa.
