01:24.451 --> 01:27.682
We've never had a-a foreign
dignitary in our house before.

01:27.821 --> 01:30.415
And now, Mom,
he's not exactly a dignitary.

01:30.557 --> 01:31.615
He's a man.

01:31.758 --> 01:32.691
Who just happens to be

01:32.826 --> 01:35.295
the fencing champion of France.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.022
Oh, that's right!
He's a champion.

01:37.164 --> 01:40.828
I hope we have enough Wheaties.

01:40.968 --> 01:43.266
Now, Mom, how long
is this French pastry

01:43.403 --> 01:44.962
gonna be staying with us?

01:45.105 --> 01:46.800
Well, Richard said
he's touring the colleges.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.567
So he'll only be here two days.

01:48.709 --> 01:51.007
Oh. I better move fast.

01:52.579 --> 01:54.809
Bonjour, bonjour,
bonjour, bonjour.

01:54.948 --> 01:55.938
Oh.

01:56.083 --> 01:57.448
He's not here yet, Howard.

01:57.584 --> 01:59.712
Oh, darn.
That's the only French I know.

01:59.853 --> 02:01.412
Uh, no. Not exactly, Dad.

02:01.555 --> 02:04.820
You know French onion soup,
French fries, French toast...

02:04.958 --> 02:05.857
I also know...

02:05.993 --> 02:08.360
(French accent):
"Get to your room."

02:08.495 --> 02:10.793
Oh, Howard,
you speak French so well.

02:10.931 --> 02:13.559
Now, I just want
everything to go well.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.464
This is the first event
that Richard has sponsored

02:15.602 --> 02:17.570
since he joined
the fencing club.

02:17.704 --> 02:19.866
Yeah, well, you know, Marion,
fencing is not exactly

02:20.007 --> 02:22.374
a household word like football
in this country.

02:22.509 --> 02:23.999
Oh, what a great idea.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.875
The Green Bay Fencers.
(laughs)

02:27.014 --> 02:27.981
-(car horn honks)
- Oh.

02:28.115 --> 02:30.982
There's Richard with Jacques.

02:31.118 --> 02:32.711
Oh, wow!

02:32.853 --> 02:34.378
Look at him-- he's gorgeous!

02:34.521 --> 02:35.511
(car doors close)

02:35.656 --> 02:38.091
Hold it, you two!

02:38.225 --> 02:39.317
I'll get the door.

02:39.459 --> 02:40.654
Wait until I wet my lips.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.785
Act your age,
will you, young lady?

02:42.929 --> 02:44.988
I thought I was.

02:45.132 --> 02:46.361
Well, we're here.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.400
- Hi.
- Well!

02:48.535 --> 02:51.368
Uh, Jacques Du Bois,
this is my mother...

02:51.505 --> 02:52.404
Marion Cunningham.

02:52.539 --> 02:53.506
<i>Enchanté.</i>

02:53.640 --> 02:55.369
Oh! Oh, my!

02:55.509 --> 02:57.341
Oh.

02:57.477 --> 02:59.309
(laughs)

02:59.446 --> 03:00.914
This is my sister Joanie.

03:01.048 --> 03:03.016
<i>Enchanté.</i>

03:03.150 --> 03:05.244
<i>- Enchanté.
-(9i99le$)</i>

03:05.385 --> 03:06.511
And this is my father,
Howard Cunningham.

03:06.653 --> 03:08.781
<i>- How do you do?
- Enchanté.</i>

03:08.922 --> 03:11.016
(laughter)

03:11.158 --> 03:12.683
As you can see, I am blessed

03:12.826 --> 03:15.318
with a superb sense of humor.

03:15.462 --> 03:17.794
Very keen, hmm.

03:17.931 --> 03:20.366
Oh, Jacques,
your English is very good.

03:20.500 --> 03:21.695
Oh, thank you.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.200
<i>Uh, parlez-vous frangais?</i>

03:23.336 --> 03:25.236
Ooh, I'd love to.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.534
I just love Europe, don't you?

03:27.674 --> 03:30.700
I went to Canada once.

03:31.845 --> 03:33.040
What's for dinner, Mom?

03:33.180 --> 03:36.172
Well, I know how
the French love to eat.

03:36.316 --> 03:39.047
So I have prepared
a typical American meal.

03:39.186 --> 03:41.883
I really do not care
for the hot dog.

03:42.022 --> 03:44.923
Oh, no, no.
We're gonna have meat loaf.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.618
I also do not care
for the hamburger.

03:47.761 --> 03:50.890
(clears throat)
Shall I, uh, uncork the wine?

03:51.031 --> 03:53.329
Oh, no. I'll just
unscrew the cap here.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.059
"Unscrew the cap"?

03:57.204 --> 03:58.137
Yes, on the wine.

03:58.271 --> 04:01.400
This is called
"Chateau Swenson."

04:01.541 --> 04:03.703
It's made right here
in Milwaukee.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.640
It goes with anything.

04:07.714 --> 04:08.875
What year is that, sweetheart?

04:09.015 --> 04:10.141
Well, it's this year, Howard.

04:10.283 --> 04:12.445
It's fresh.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.984
I think I shall, uh,

04:16.123 --> 04:19.320
how you say-- "skip dinner"?

04:19.459 --> 04:21.291
I think I must go to my room.

04:21.428 --> 04:22.862
Uh, my bags?

04:24.264 --> 04:25.288
Sure.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.696
(groans)

04:27.834 --> 04:29.268
Let me tell you
about my trip to Canada.

04:29.402 --> 04:31.393
Yes, uh, must you?

04:34.508 --> 04:36.374
<i>AL: Well, what are
you guys having?</i>

04:36.510 --> 04:37.409
ls the fish fresh?

04:37.544 --> 04:38.773
- Well...
-"ls the fish fresh?"

04:38.912 --> 04:40.676
It's so fresh,
it made a pass at me.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.111
(both laughing)

04:42.249 --> 04:44.479
Or it's so fresh, it got
expelled from its school.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.177
Ha-ha-ha! Or it's so...

04:46.319 --> 04:49.584
Oh, never mind,
I've got a picnic on my mind.

04:49.723 --> 04:50.622
(laughs)

04:50.757 --> 04:51.815
What's with him?

04:51.958 --> 04:52.857
He got a date.

04:52.993 --> 04:55.690
Kitty Fox said yes?

04:55.829 --> 04:58.526
Charm, wit
and intelligence works.

04:58.665 --> 04:59.723
- He begged.
- All right...

04:59.866 --> 05:01.630
why don't you just order, Pots?

05:01.768 --> 05:02.792
Oh, I'll have an Arnold burger.

05:02.936 --> 05:05.303
Good choice.
What's yours, Ralph?

05:05.438 --> 05:07.873
Nothing. Kitty and I
are going on a picnic.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.999
Ah, picnic is nice.

05:10.143 --> 05:13.135
You know my first date
with Rosa Colletti was a picnic?

05:14.548 --> 05:16.539
Yeah. Yup, yup. WP-

05:19.786 --> 05:22.153
Al, do me a favor, okay?

05:22.289 --> 05:24.189
Take all French food
off the menu.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.156
We don't have any French food.

05:26.293 --> 05:27.920
Good. Keep it that way.

05:29.196 --> 05:30.288
Hey, Rich.

05:30.430 --> 05:31.989
Richie, old pal! I'm so happy!

05:32.132 --> 05:33.896
- I'm not.
- What's the matter?

05:34.034 --> 05:35.900
It's this Jacques Du Bois guy.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.835
He's got all the charm
of a rope burn.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.497
You should've seen him
at our house.

05:40.640 --> 05:43.473
(French accent):
This is my room?

05:43.610 --> 05:44.736
(scoffs)

05:44.878 --> 05:47.404
This is my dinner?

05:47.547 --> 05:48.776
(scoffs)

05:48.915 --> 05:50.212
(normal voice): I had to keep
Dad from throwing him

05:50.350 --> 05:52.216
-out of the house.
- Why didn't he?

05:52.352 --> 05:54.446
Jacques was polishing
his sword at the time.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.955
Let me tell you something
about Jacques Du Bois.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.717
He is the most irritat...

05:58.859 --> 06:01.157
-interesting guy.
- Richard.

06:01.294 --> 06:02.819
(French accent):
Yeah. This is my...

06:02.963 --> 06:04.692
(normal voice):
I mean, uh...

06:04.831 --> 06:06.265
This is my good friend
Ralph Malph.

06:06.399 --> 06:07.696
And my friend Potsie Weber.

06:07.834 --> 06:09.063
- How are you doing?
- Nice...

06:09.202 --> 06:10.499
Uh, tell me.

06:10.637 --> 06:12.833
I hope everything is ready
for my exhibition tomorrow?

06:12.973 --> 06:14.270
Well, of course it's ready.

06:14.407 --> 06:15.738
We do things right here
at UWM.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.207
- Right, guys?
- That's right.

06:17.344 --> 06:19.335
POTSIE:
You got it.

06:24.517 --> 06:25.575
Hey, Al?

06:25.719 --> 06:29.280
If Beatrice, Sandy,
Amanda, Nastasia,

06:29.422 --> 06:31.948
if they come in here,
you tell them the answer is yes.

06:32.092 --> 06:33.218
Sure, Fonz.

06:33.360 --> 06:34.987
What was the question?

06:43.703 --> 06:46.798
At last...
an interesting person.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.499
Who is this?

06:48.642 --> 06:50.303
Jacques Du Bois,
this is my good friend

06:50.443 --> 06:51.808
Arthur Fonzarelli.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.538
Heyyy.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.739
Well, I have long looked forward

06:55.882 --> 06:58.817
to meeting a typical
American hoodlum.

07:00.353 --> 07:01.878
Tell me.

07:02.022 --> 07:05.014
Are you off to stick up

07:05.158 --> 07:06.785
a gas station?

07:06.927 --> 07:09.521
(both laughing)

07:09.663 --> 07:11.654
Conference time.

07:14.501 --> 07:17.436
What are you-- nutso?

07:17.570 --> 07:19.402
This guy talks funny.
He from out of town?

07:21.274 --> 07:23.368
Yeah, Fonz.
He's from France.

07:23.510 --> 07:26.480
That's a long way to come
to get punched out.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.581
Listen, believe me.

07:28.715 --> 07:31.309
I know he's a pain, but he's
a guest in this country.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.850
I think we need to be cordial.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.112
All right?

07:34.254 --> 07:35.744
From France, huh?

07:35.889 --> 07:39.120
I'll do it for Brigitte Bardot.

07:39.259 --> 07:40.920
Thanks, Fonz.

07:42.862 --> 07:45.456
Jacques is here to, uh,
give a special demonstration.

07:45.598 --> 07:47.032
Oh, do you fence?

07:47.167 --> 07:50.398
I never touched
stolen goods in my life.

07:51.738 --> 07:53.433
No, Fonz. Uh, he's
talking about fencing.

07:53.573 --> 07:55.007
You know, with swords, Zorro.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.769
All right, I knew that,
I knew that.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.970
I dated a fencing teacher once.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.979
We foiled around.

08:02.115 --> 08:03.139
(laughter)

08:03.283 --> 08:05.513
lam, uh, putting
on an exhibition

08:05.652 --> 08:06.983
at the gymnasium tomorrow.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.281
Perhaps you would like
to come and see

08:08.421 --> 08:10.355
a demonstration of my skill.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.219
I got no time, Jack.

08:12.359 --> 08:13.520
That is Jacques.

08:13.660 --> 08:16.561
Whatever you say, Jack.

08:16.696 --> 08:19.427
I'm putting on
a demonstration of my own.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.428
I'd ask you to come along,
but I don't want

08:23.570 --> 08:26.301
to give you
an inferiority complex.

08:29.376 --> 08:32.174
Very interesting example

08:32.312 --> 08:34.178
of the lower class.

08:34.313 --> 08:36.214
You're lucky Fonzie
didn't hear you say that...

08:36.349 --> 08:38.716
Jack.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.082
Hi, Ralphie.

08:41.221 --> 08:43.655
Kitty said yes?

08:45.258 --> 08:48.353
<i>RICHIE:
Fellow fencing enthusiasts,</i>

08:48.495 --> 08:51.931
it gives me great pleasure
to introduce the fencees.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.295
First, the current
champion of France...

08:54.434 --> 08:56.835
Jacques Du Bois.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.961
(applause)

09:00.707 --> 09:03.836
And now, the current
conference champion,

09:03.977 --> 09:06.469
winner of three
consecutive titles,

09:06.613 --> 09:08.240
our very own

09:08.381 --> 09:11.578
Georgie "Thrust
and Parry" Smith!

09:11.718 --> 09:13.311
(applause and cheering)

09:13.453 --> 09:15.387
GIRL:
Go, Georgie!

09:15.522 --> 09:16.956
And, uh, refereeing the bout
will be the president

09:17.090 --> 09:18.649
of the UWM fencing society.

09:18.792 --> 09:21.056
You all know him very well--
Fred Brill.

09:21.194 --> 09:23.185
-(cheering)
.Yay, Fred!

09:25.131 --> 09:27.793
Gentlemen, take your places.

09:27.934 --> 09:29.595
Are you ready?

09:29.736 --> 09:31.727
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, monsieur.

09:33.573 --> 09:37.032
En garde!

09:37.177 --> 09:39.339
Fence.

09:39.479 --> 09:41.038
<i>(both grunt)</i>

09:41.181 --> 09:42.444
(laughing)

09:42.582 --> 09:44.607
Next.

09:46.653 --> 09:48.178
Why is everything so quiet?

09:48.321 --> 09:50.289
ALL THREE:
It's over.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.289
Oh, you guys are such kidders.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.722
"It's over." It's...

09:53.860 --> 09:55.885
It's over.

09:56.863 --> 09:58.422
Conference champion?

09:58.565 --> 09:59.623
CHACHI:
Yeah.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.791
No wonder fencing
never caught on over here.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.063
Yeah. You don't even have
time to buy a hot dog.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.605
Let's get out of here.

10:06.739 --> 10:08.229
(laughing)

10:08.374 --> 10:10.741
Is that...
is that your best?

10:10.877 --> 10:12.572
(laughing)

10:12.712 --> 10:15.545
My chambermaid
could've beaten him.

10:15.682 --> 10:18.743
Well, look, everybody
can have an off day, right?

10:18.885 --> 10:21.718
I laugh in your face.
(laughing)

10:23.523 --> 10:25.355
I wouldn't do that again
if I were you.

10:25.492 --> 10:28.052
41a!
41a!

10:28.194 --> 10:31.186
I have not found one worthy
opponent in all of America.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.493
All right now, watch it.
You're talking about my country.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.034
Oh, how can you be
proud of a country

10:36.169 --> 10:39.366
that is made up of nothing
but uncouth peasants?

10:39.506 --> 10:41.099
(crowd murmuring)

10:43.009 --> 10:46.001
You obnoxious wimp!

10:46.146 --> 10:49.138
(crowd clamors in agreement)

10:50.416 --> 10:51.542
"Wimp"?

10:51.684 --> 10:53.652
Obnoxious wimp.

10:53.786 --> 10:54.514
Is that bad?

10:54.654 --> 10:56.645
It's the worst, bucko!

10:59.692 --> 11:01.524
I have been insulted!

11:01.661 --> 11:03.993
I have been hurt.

11:04.130 --> 11:07.259
We shall duel tomorrow.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.027
2:00. Be here.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.365
Well, wait a minute. Uh, duel?

11:11.504 --> 11:13.029
Uh,

11:13.173 --> 11:15.073
look, I... I got
a little carried away.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.006
And-and I apologize.

11:17.143 --> 11:19.077
You're not a-a wimp.

11:19.212 --> 11:20.373
<i>Trés bien.</i>

11:20.513 --> 11:22.174
Apology accepted.

11:22.315 --> 11:23.976
The duel is cancelled.

11:25.385 --> 11:26.580
Here, Jacques.

11:26.719 --> 11:27.880
I brought you some water.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.716
<i>Merci.</i>

11:29.856 --> 11:32.223
Um, you were very good, Jacques.

11:32.358 --> 11:34.258
How would you like to come
with me to Arnold's

11:34.394 --> 11:35.953
and meet some of my friends?

11:36.095 --> 11:38.530
Certainly not, silly child.

11:38.665 --> 11:40.565
JOANIE:
"Silly child"?

11:40.700 --> 11:42.998
I was only trying
to be friendly.

11:43.136 --> 11:45.002
I do not have time
to be friendly

11:45.138 --> 11:47.300
with giggling infants.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.580
You had no right talking
to her like that.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.649
That was my sister.

11:57.784 --> 11:58.979
You were just rude to my sister!

11:59.118 --> 12:01.280
Nobody insults my sister
and gets away with it!

12:01.421 --> 12:04.049
But I just did.

12:04.190 --> 12:06.249
All right.

12:06.392 --> 12:07.655
Let me borrow this for a second.

12:07.794 --> 12:08.818
Of course.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.726
Ooh!

12:14.734 --> 12:16.896
Duel-- 2:00 tomorrow.

12:17.036 --> 12:18.026
Be here!

12:18.171 --> 12:20.105
Thanks for the glove.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.504
It will be my pleasure

12:22.642 --> 12:25.236
to humiliate you in a duel.

12:25.378 --> 12:28.279
Yeah, we'll see who gets
humiliated, bucko!

12:30.016 --> 12:33.281
You're on thin ice when you're
dueling with Richie Cunningham!

12:33.419 --> 12:35.581
(chuckles)

12:35.722 --> 12:38.248
Richie Cunningham
doesn't know how to duel.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.897
I'm ready.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.600
Just let me
at that Jacques Du Bois!

12:54.741 --> 12:56.436
I'll be all right.

12:56.576 --> 12:58.943
First, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
fence him up into a corner, see?

12:59.078 --> 13:02.104
And then...
(grunts)

13:02.248 --> 13:04.239
Aw.

13:05.585 --> 13:07.576
L-I wonder how you say
"oops" in French?

13:07.720 --> 13:11.350
Listen, I think
you'll be just fine,

13:11.491 --> 13:14.188
if you can manage
to hang on to this.

13:14.327 --> 13:17.422
Yeah. You know, I just wish
it was basketball season.

13:17.563 --> 13:20.555
Because then I, I could really
show him a thing or two, I...

13:22.669 --> 13:24.262
Well, uh, I'll see you later.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.395
HOWARD:
Okay.

13:27.974 --> 13:31.274
Might as well bring
the whole sword with me.

13:33.279 --> 13:36.180
<i>CHACHV. All right,
gather around everybody!</i>

13:36.316 --> 13:38.842
And get your tickets
for the duel of the century!

13:38.985 --> 13:41.215
It's only moments away.

13:41.354 --> 13:44.119
There you go.

13:44.257 --> 13:45.691
There he is!

13:45.825 --> 13:47.315
That's the man.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.019
Don't you want
to see him grovel?

13:49.162 --> 13:50.425
Don't you want
to see him embarrassed

13:50.563 --> 13:52.395
in front of a large crowd
of people?

13:52.532 --> 13:54.364
Chachi.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.264
Rich, the money's
going to charity.

13:56.402 --> 13:57.665
Ah.

13:59.205 --> 14:01.003
Okay, everybody,
form the line here.

14:01.140 --> 14:02.767
Don't push.
There's plenty of seats.

14:02.909 --> 14:03.933
Hey, Rich.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.636
Aw, Rich, come on, sit down.

14:05.778 --> 14:08.645
Have a nice Arnold burger on me.

14:08.781 --> 14:09.805
Hey, Fonz!

14:12.819 --> 14:14.287
- Hey, Fonz.
- Fonz.

14:14.420 --> 14:16.411
Hi, Fonz.

14:21.227 --> 14:22.956
In my office, Cunningham.

14:24.630 --> 14:27.099
Fonz, I'm-I'm,
I'm about to fight a duel.

14:27.233 --> 14:30.396
In your underwear?
In my office.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.527
Thank you.

14:35.274 --> 14:36.935
(groans)
I'm not a Musketeer.

14:37.076 --> 14:39.875
I'm a Mouseketeer.

14:40.012 --> 14:41.776
All right, conversate with me.

14:41.914 --> 14:43.746
Well, our fencer was
just pathetic.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.874
I mean, Jacques' chambermaid
could've beaten him.

14:46.018 --> 14:48.419
So I called Jacques an obnoxious
wimp when he insulted America.

14:48.554 --> 14:49.919
And he slapped
my face with a glove,

14:50.056 --> 14:51.046
but then I apologized.

14:51.190 --> 14:52.248
But then he insulted Joanie.

14:52.392 --> 14:53.791
So I slapped
his face with a glove.

14:53.926 --> 14:55.792
And now we're having
a duel today at 2:00.

14:55.928 --> 14:58.226
Well, I'll see you around, Fonz.

14:58.364 --> 14:59.889
Wait a minute.

15:00.032 --> 15:02.626
Are you telling me
that this guy insulted America?

15:02.769 --> 15:03.861
Yeah.

15:04.003 --> 15:05.664
This guy insulted Joanie?

15:05.805 --> 15:06.704
That's right.

15:06.839 --> 15:09.501
Now I'm mad.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.610
Yeah, I started off mad.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.610
Then I worked my way
up to scared.

15:14.781 --> 15:16.579
- I got to get going.
- Hey, before you go.

15:16.716 --> 15:17.740
Yeah, Fonz?

15:17.884 --> 15:18.976
Don't.

15:19.118 --> 15:20.984
No, Fonz, I-l just have to.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.019
Let me do it.

15:22.155 --> 15:24.419
I got a black belt in fencing.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.851
No, they-they don't give
a black belt for fencing.

15:28.995 --> 15:30.156
My teacher gave me a black belt.

15:30.296 --> 15:32.890
I got black socks to match.

15:33.032 --> 15:34.796
Well, I... No, no, no.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.333
My-my honor is at stake.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.631
Rich, it ain't your honor.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.034
It's America's honor.

15:40.173 --> 15:41.197
No, I'm the one
who got slapped...

15:41.340 --> 15:42.705
I want you to look out there.
What do you see?

15:42.842 --> 15:44.640
I'll tell you what you see.
You see a mountain.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.371
A big mountain.
You know what that is?

15:47.513 --> 15:49.277
I got to go, Fonz. Uh...

15:49.415 --> 15:52.510
- It's the Purple Mountain's
Majesty. -Right.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.552
Now, on top of that
big mountain, you see it?

15:54.687 --> 15:57.884
You see the big flagpole raising
up out of that mountain?

15:58.024 --> 16:00.994
You know what's flapping
in the breeze off that flagpole?

16:01.127 --> 16:03.619
Old Glory.
Red, white and blue.

16:03.763 --> 16:06.232
Stars and stripes forever.
Do you see it?

16:06.365 --> 16:08.766
I do see it, Fonz.
I see it!

16:08.901 --> 16:10.665
Now, who's underneath
that flagpole?

16:10.803 --> 16:12.032
- Who's standing there?
- Who?!

16:12.171 --> 16:13.104
- Joanie.
- Joanie!

16:13.239 --> 16:15.435
That's right!

16:15.575 --> 16:18.636
In all of her American
womanhood and purity.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.041
Don't it give you
a lump in your throat?

16:20.179 --> 16:21.647
- It does, Fonz.
- Yeah.

16:21.781 --> 16:24.045
You see what she's got
in her hands?

16:24.183 --> 16:25.116
I can't quite see it.

16:25.251 --> 16:26.548
It's an apple pie.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.279
That's what it's
all about, Fonz!

16:28.421 --> 16:29.354
Well, then give me your clothes!

16:29.489 --> 16:30.650
I'm off to defend America,

16:30.790 --> 16:33.191
Mom and a slice of pie.

16:45.938 --> 16:46.905
<i>PQTSE:
Don't worry, Rich.</i>

16:47.039 --> 16:47.938
We're all behind you.

16:48.074 --> 16:49.235
That's right, Rich.

16:49.375 --> 16:51.366
AL:
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.570
Here's the moment
we've all been waiting for.

16:53.713 --> 16:56.205
First, the greatest
swordsman of all France...

16:56.349 --> 16:57.282
Jacques Du Bois.

16:57.416 --> 16:59.407
(crowd booing)

17:00.887 --> 17:02.082
And his opponent...

17:02.221 --> 17:03.814
Richie Cunningham!

17:03.956 --> 17:05.946
(crowd cheering)

17:08.060 --> 17:10.461
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

17:10.596 --> 17:12.189
And hey, folks, how about it?
Right after the duel,

17:12.330 --> 17:13.992
let's all go to Arnold's, huh?

17:14.133 --> 17:16.932
(mumbles)

17:17.069 --> 17:19.265
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
are you ready?

17:19.405 --> 17:21.099
Duelists to the center.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.799
I'm surprised to see you here.

17:22.942 --> 17:25.912
You show more courage
than intelligence, Cunningham.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.672
AL:
Are you ready?

17:30.116 --> 17:32.107
En garde!

17:35.021 --> 17:37.012
Commence dueling!

17:38.791 --> 17:39.986
(grunts)
What?!

17:40.126 --> 17:41.855
(crowd cheering)

17:44.931 --> 17:46.558
I knew he could do it!

17:46.699 --> 17:48.793
All right, Rich!

17:53.105 --> 17:56.564
At last, a worthy opponent.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.768
You, Richard Cunningham,

17:59.912 --> 18:01.903
are a man of honor.

18:02.048 --> 18:03.709
No, he's not.

18:03.849 --> 18:05.817
(crowd murmuring)

18:09.956 --> 18:13.085
Richie Cunningham
is no man of honor.

18:13.225 --> 18:15.819
(crowd gasping, murmuring)

18:16.896 --> 18:19.024
You are you. Who is this?!

18:21.367 --> 18:23.665
CROWD:
Fonz!

18:23.803 --> 18:25.737
The hoodlum.

18:26.906 --> 18:30.467
Do you have to keep saying that?

18:30.610 --> 18:32.442
Fonz, look, I'm sorry.

18:32.578 --> 18:34.569
But-but he called Richie
Cunningham a man of honor.

18:34.714 --> 18:37.274
And it's not honorable hiding up
there in the stands, so...

18:37.416 --> 18:39.578
so just give me the foil.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.278
I'm gonna take you on myself.

18:41.420 --> 18:42.353
All right?

18:42.488 --> 18:43.978
En garde!

18:44.123 --> 18:47.093
It was my face that was slapped.

18:47.226 --> 18:50.093
And the rules state that I have

18:50.229 --> 18:52.561
the right to choose my opponent.

18:52.698 --> 18:54.291
And I choose...

18:54.433 --> 18:56.424
the hoodlum.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.505
Well, rules are rules.

19:05.177 --> 19:06.269
Messieurs...

19:06.412 --> 19:07.402
madames?

19:07.546 --> 19:09.036
It appears I am faced

19:09.181 --> 19:11.206
with an, uh, experienced

19:11.350 --> 19:13.341
and worthy swordsman.

19:13.486 --> 19:16.046
How would you like
to see duelling

19:16.188 --> 19:19.385
the way it really was
in the olden times?

19:19.525 --> 19:21.050
(crowd clamors in agreement)

19:21.193 --> 19:23.321
Uh, do not be afraid, monsieur.

19:23.462 --> 19:26.329
I will not injure you.

19:26.465 --> 19:27.899
But I will give you a lesson

19:28.034 --> 19:30.264
you will not soon forget.
(laughs)

19:32.238 --> 19:34.229
- I~I "(mbwgagheisp s)

19:34.373 --> 19:35.363
(crowd oohs)

19:35.508 --> 19:37.237
<i>Merci.</i>

19:41.814 --> 19:43.839
Cute.

19:49.221 --> 19:51.246
(Jacques laughs)

19:51.390 --> 19:53.381
You missed.

19:55.327 --> 19:57.591
(crowd cheering)

20:00.199 --> 20:01.826
FONZIE:
My jacket.

20:01.967 --> 20:03.958
Sure, Fonz.

20:06.305 --> 20:07.568
Yeah.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.334
JACQUES:
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

20:09.475 --> 20:12.740
We shall duel as my forefathers.

20:12.878 --> 20:15.506
Masks were not worn.

20:17.650 --> 20:20.347
All right,
give me that microphone.

20:20.486 --> 20:22.853
All right, now, listen up.

20:22.988 --> 20:26.117
Since my opponent here is, uh...

20:26.258 --> 20:28.226
living in another time,

20:28.360 --> 20:31.125
and since he is
the best swordsman

20:31.263 --> 20:32.458
in all of France,

20:32.598 --> 20:35.397
and I am the best swordsman

20:35.534 --> 20:37.798
everyplace else...

20:39.171 --> 20:40.696
...I'll meet his terms.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.638
But if I catch anybody--

20:42.775 --> 20:43.970
dig it, anybody--

20:44.110 --> 20:46.636
fencing without a mask,

20:46.779 --> 20:49.373
they are nutso
and no friend of mine.

20:49.515 --> 20:50.744
JACQUES:
Bring the sabers.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.110
Now, wait a minute, gentlemen.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.916
Now, old or new, this is
still a contest of skills.

20:58.057 --> 21:00.526
Gentlemen, I'd like
to inspect the swords.

21:00.659 --> 21:03.185
Oh... Fonz.

21:03.329 --> 21:05.195
All right, good and blunt.

21:05.331 --> 21:06.662
Ready, gentlemen?

21:08.534 --> 21:09.626
En garde!

21:09.769 --> 21:11.032
Commence dueling!

21:16.742 --> 21:17.868
Ha!

21:19.779 --> 21:21.747
-(vells)
Acrowd gasps)

21:24.116 --> 21:26.346
(grunting)

21:29.555 --> 21:32.149
I'm very proud
of my family crest!

21:32.291 --> 21:35.090
My family goes back
to Louis XIV.

21:35.227 --> 21:38.686
How far back does
your family go?!

21:38.831 --> 21:40.765
Ellis Island!

21:50.242 --> 21:51.334
Aah!

21:51.477 --> 21:53.741
If you win, you have the honor

21:53.879 --> 21:55.973
of wearing my family crest.

21:56.115 --> 21:57.776
What are you proud of?

21:59.985 --> 22:01.578
Paula Petralunga.

22:04.256 --> 22:06.418
Sounds fascinating.

22:06.559 --> 22:08.493
If I win...

22:08.627 --> 22:10.789
she is mine-- it's a bet?

22:10.930 --> 22:13.126
She ain't mine to give, but I'll
put a good word in for you.

22:16.602 --> 22:18.366
Aah!

22:18.504 --> 22:20.233
(grunting)

22:22.608 --> 22:24.133
Aah! Oh!

22:24.276 --> 22:26.472
(crowd cheering)

22:35.321 --> 22:37.983
Why don't you use
two hands next time?

22:38.123 --> 22:40.114
(crowd murmuring)

22:41.360 --> 22:43.351
Aah! Hyah!

22:46.565 --> 22:48.260
- Ooh!
-(crowd cheering)

22:48.400 --> 22:50.027
(crowd clamoring)

22:50.169 --> 22:52.035
(grunting)

23:03.349 --> 23:05.215
(crowd cheering)

23:08.520 --> 23:09.419
Aah!

23:09.555 --> 23:11.546
(grunting)

23:14.560 --> 23:16.324
Ah-ah, drop it!

23:21.533 --> 23:23.695
I want you to say uncle.

23:23.836 --> 23:24.598
"Uncle"?

23:24.737 --> 23:26.762
Uncle... Sam.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.738
Uncle Sam.

23:28.874 --> 23:30.865
(crowd cheering)

23:35.581 --> 23:38.073
You are the better swordsman.

23:38.217 --> 23:41.016
And what is more important...
a fine gentleman.

23:41.153 --> 23:44.316
You have taught me... humility.

23:44.456 --> 23:45.821
It's the least I could do.

23:45.958 --> 23:48.791
I mean, you did give us
the Statue of Liberty.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.396
- All right, Fonz!
- Yeah!

23:50.529 --> 23:52.088
(crowd clamoring)

23:53.399 --> 23:56.391
Hey, uh... Jack?

23:56.535 --> 23:57.525
- Fonz?
- Yeah?

23:57.670 --> 23:59.832
His name is Jacques.

23:59.972 --> 24:01.565
Jacques.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.168
You want to join us?

24:06.512 --> 24:10.176
Uh, tell me about this, uh,

24:10.316 --> 24:13.115
Paula Petralunga?

24:13.252 --> 24:14.617
I'll think about it.

24:14.753 --> 24:16.118
Come on, let's go.

24:16.255 --> 24:18.246
All right.

24:28.067 --> 24:29.125
Hey, everybody!

24:29.268 --> 24:30.167
- Hey, Fonz.
- Hi, Fonzie.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.066
Now, did Jacques
get off all right?

24:32.204 --> 24:34.673
Oh, yeah, he got off
with a big smile.

24:34.807 --> 24:37.674
Left Milwaukee with a smile,
said thank you to you guys.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.835
I thought he'd be sad.
He said he'd miss us.

24:39.979 --> 24:42.380
Well, he was a little sad,
you know, but he got over it.

24:42.514 --> 24:44.949
I think it was
the ride on my bike.

24:45.084 --> 24:46.848
Well, why did the ride
on the bike make him so happy?

24:46.986 --> 24:49.853
Did you ever ride on my bike
with Paula Petralunga?

24:49.989 --> 24:52.686
Yeah, sure. So?

24:52.825 --> 24:54.589
Over bumps?

24:55.794 --> 24:57.319
