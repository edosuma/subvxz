Wai-wai-wai-wait!

00:19.040 --> 00:22.070
Just-just look
at me! Please!

00:23.440 --> 00:27.530
Is this-is this
the hospital?

00:28.540 --> 00:32.820
D- did I make it out? I made it!

00:35.790 --> 00:39.090
This isn't the hospital.

00:56.360 --> 01:01.040
Oh god, please, please, please.

01:04.140 --> 01:05.790
Please.

A NIGHT IN THE SHOW
Featuring Charles Chaplin

01:31.810 --> 01:34.900
- You're not teaching today?
- This afternoon.

01:35.630 --> 01:39.130
- What's this?
- It's genius.

01:39.140 --> 01:42.090
You have Chaplin on film?

01:42.100 --> 01:45.040
My great-granddad was an accountant
at one of the first movie studios.

01:45.050 --> 01:48.300
- He lived in california?
- No, no, no. Chicago.

01:48.310 --> 01:51.570
Essanay studios. Closed 1920.

01:51.580 --> 01:55.720
Back then,you had 4 of 5 movies made in
the U.S. They were all made in chicago.

01:56.370 --> 01:58.620
They closed down and
let my grandpa take a...

01:58.630 --> 02:02.250
- Eh, a couple of extra prints home.
- They let him?

02:02.260 --> 02:05.850
Well, that's the family
story. We're stickin' to it.

02:08.479 --> 02:10.310
This guy's a genius.

02:10.320 --> 02:12.650
How come you haven't
brought these in before?

02:12.660 --> 02:14.730
Showing it to my cadets today.

02:14.740 --> 02:18.490
I try to leave 'em with some kind of strategy
for dealing with the stress the job brings.

02:18.500 --> 02:20.050
Like comedy.

02:20.060 --> 02:23.170
Greatest gift my granddad ever left me.

02:23.740 --> 02:27.980
What's going on in here? Oh,
mr.Chaplin. The funny guy.

02:29.410 --> 02:34.370
You know,if what i hear is true about that
man, that right there was the original player.

02:34.800 --> 02:38.600
Ok, but, guys, seriously, what's
up with the rickety projector?

02:38.610 --> 02:40.110
They don't have this on DVD?

02:40.120 --> 02:43.400
Hey, some people like things
run through a projector.

02:43.410 --> 02:47.160
I think I'm gonna let you two
old-timers do your thing. I'm out.

02:47.170 --> 02:50.130
Hey,I got a couple little
tramp reels if you have time.

02:50.140 --> 02:52.600
I got a few minutes.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.930
That's...

03:04.300 --> 03:07.180
- Agent Jareau?
- It's open.

03:07.190 --> 03:10.660
Detective McGee, Kansas
city P.D. I called last week.

03:10.960 --> 03:13.480
About some missing people
in downtown Kansas City.

03:13.490 --> 03:15.190
Uh, right, right. Um...

03:15.200 --> 03:18.010
I'm sorry. Didn't i ask you
to send me your files first?

03:18.020 --> 03:22.610
Yeah. Um, about that, I-I
don't, uh, have any files.

03:22.620 --> 03:24.360
No-no one's actually
been reported missing yet.

03:24.370 --> 03:27.580
- It's-it's more like
a theory. - Theory.

03:27.590 --> 03:29.400
Yeah. Um...

03:29.910 --> 03:35.200
Brought you the most relevant ones.
I have, um, like, 40 more of them.

03:38.930 --> 03:42.170
I catalogue everybody I come
in contact with on the street-

03:42.180 --> 03:46.650
um,names,descriptions,uh, what
they're wearing, identifying marks.

03:46.660 --> 03:49.250
Anyways, my department assigned
me to keep an eye on downtown,

03:49.260 --> 03:53.840
uh, skid row, dopers, um, hooker
stroll, whatnot. Typical stuff.

03:54.190 --> 03:58.800
And everything was going good until I started
noticing there were less and less every week.

03:58.810 --> 04:01.620
- Of... -
Of-of them.

04:01.630 --> 04:05.680
Less vagrants, less-less prostitutes,
less junkies strung out on the corners.

04:05.690 --> 04:07.610
Well, sounds to me like
you're doing a good job.

04:07.620 --> 04:10.470
Yeah, that's what my bosses
think. I actually, uh...

04:11.390 --> 04:14.920
Got an award last week
from the mayor's office.

04:18.560 --> 04:20.600
- So...
- So I'm not doing it.

04:20.610 --> 04:24.220
Crime went down because the people
committing the crimes have disappeared.

04:24.230 --> 04:30.400
And-and then, over the last several weeks,
people seem to be disappearing at a couple a day.

04:30.410 --> 04:35.070
Isn't that the nature of these particular
groups is that they're transient?

04:35.080 --> 04:37.460
No. No. N-not this many this fast.

04:37.470 --> 04:41.010
I- I'm telling you,I can- I
can talk to somebody at lunch,

04:41.020 --> 04:44.340
and by dinnertime, they're
wiped off the face of the earth.

04:44.350 --> 04:48.330
- Ok. Um, how many is it?
- 63

04:50.360 --> 04:53.110
- 63 people?
- At least 63.

04:53.120 --> 04:57.460
63 people that I regularly used
to see are just not there anymore.

04:57.470 --> 05:00.140
And then last week, I, um...

05:00.820 --> 05:03.870
I got this in the mail
at the stationhouse.

05:03.880 --> 05:08.250
There are two types of people in the world. Those
who do the work and those who take the credit.

05:08.260 --> 05:09.940
You should be ashamed.

05:09.950 --> 05:14.160
Somebody else knows that I'm getting
praised for something that I did not do.

05:14.170 --> 05:18.520
63 people. You're-you're
sure about this?

05:18.530 --> 05:21.350
Something is happening
out there, agent Jareau.

05:22.750 --> 05:25.740
Something bad.

06:05.717 --> 06:08.157
You aren't sure whether
anyone is in fact missing.

06:08.167 --> 06:11.607
No, I-I am sure. I just can't
seem to convince anyone else of it.

06:11.617 --> 06:14.397
- There's been no official investigation?
- No.

06:14.407 --> 06:17.307
63 people can't be coincidence, right?

06:17.317 --> 06:22.337
Reid, any stats on the percentages of, um well,
I don't really know how to phrase the question.

06:22.347 --> 06:23.887
Homeless who go missing?

06:23.897 --> 06:27.977
The very nature of homelessness
suggests a lifestyle of fluidity, yet

06:27.987 --> 06:29.717
honestly, they're not as
transient as you would think.

06:29.727 --> 06:34.947
They generally stay in small, well-defined areas
based on familiarity and what services are nearby.

06:34.957 --> 06:37.757
So-so you're saying
they don't just disappear.

06:37.767 --> 06:41.707
Not normally, but I mean, that
doesn't preclude the possibility.

06:41.717 --> 06:44.757
Names, addresses, descriptions.

06:44.767 --> 06:48.477
Do-do you have any information
that might help us find them again?

06:48.487 --> 06:50.027
I- I didn't have a
need for it at the time.

06:50.037 --> 06:53.807
Do you have enough here to see if
they've been reported missing by someone?

06:53.817 --> 06:55.387
I don't- I
don't know.

06:55.397 --> 06:58.527
I- I ran them all through our
computers and came up blank.

06:58.537 --> 07:02.477
None of them turned up deceased?
Checked the morgues and the hospitals?

07:02.487 --> 07:05.317
I- I have checked
everywhere, sir.

07:05.327 --> 07:07.517
Simply being gone isn't a federal issue.

07:07.527 --> 07:11.297
We're gonna need an official
invitation into your jurisdiction.

07:12.267 --> 07:14.907
- An official?
- Police chief, chief of detectives.

07:14.917 --> 07:18.677
It has to come down through the chain of
command. We have no authority to look into this.

07:19.787 --> 07:22.157
Um, I don't know that
I- I can do that.

07:22.167 --> 07:25.487
Unless we're officially
asked, we can't help you.

07:25.497 --> 07:30.757
Jurisdictional issues aren't open for
debate. Sorry. It's out of our hands.

07:31.687 --> 07:34.237
Uh, Hotch...

07:34.247 --> 07:38.357
There could be 63 victims here.

07:41.807 --> 07:44.997
Well, I suppose you and I could go back
with the detective and talk to his commanders

07:45.007 --> 07:47.197
and try to impress upon them
the serious implications.

07:47.207 --> 07:48.837
Thank you.

07:48.847 --> 07:51.107
If we get an invitation, we
could send for the rest of you.

07:51.117 --> 07:53.507
I just don't want to give the
appearance that we're running over them.

07:53.517 --> 07:55.867
I'll wrap my class up.

07:55.877 --> 07:58.847
If anything changes,let me know.
I should be available by 4:00.

07:58.857 --> 08:02.767
- J.J.Be ready in 30.
- Agent. Um, sir.

08:02.777 --> 08:06.457
- He-he took 2 of my book- - uh,if
you could leave your notebooks with us,

08:06.467 --> 08:10.177
we can unofficially go over them and
maybe develop some more information.

08:10.187 --> 08:14.497
How about I show you, uh, which people aren't around
anymore and you can copy down all the information.

08:14.527 --> 08:16.687
Ok. Well,you heard agent Hotchner.

08:16.697 --> 08:19.277
You got 30 minutes to
brief us on 63 people.

08:19.287 --> 08:21.427
Ok. Um...

08:23.707 --> 08:26.447
Of all the preposterous
assumptions of humanity,

08:26.457 --> 08:31.207
nothing exceeds the criticisms made of
the habits of the poor by the well-housed

08:31.217 --> 08:35.267
well-warmed, and
well-fed. Herman melville.

08:37.967 --> 08:41.256
- Landing in 10 minutes.
- What?

08:41.857 --> 08:45.817
- We're landing in 10 minutes.
- Already?

08:45.827 --> 08:48.167
It's a fast plane.

08:51.017 --> 08:55.067
- He's really into those notebooks.
- Almost obsessional.

08:56.287 --> 08:58.767
You mean clinically obsessional.

08:58.777 --> 09:00.967
Obsessive note-taking
could be a form of O.C.D.

09:00.977 --> 09:04.487
So the only witness we have to any
of this might be mentally unstable?

09:04.497 --> 09:08.127
- That's possible. - This
may be be a wild-goose chase.

09:08.137 --> 09:13.027
But as someone I greatly respect
suggested, 63 people may be in trouble

09:13.037 --> 09:15.887
and I think that that's worth the chase.

09:27.897 --> 09:31.157
- Damn.
- That is a lot of people.

09:31.167 --> 09:35.687
Homeless men, homeless women,
runaways, prostitutes, and drug users.

09:35.697 --> 09:38.947
Can all of their
disappearances be a coincidence?

09:38.957 --> 09:41.107
Yeah, technically it wouldn't
really be a coincidence

09:41.117 --> 09:44.447
since a number of these people share
high-risk traits, which throws the curve off.

09:44.457 --> 09:45.647
You see, the word
"coincidence" implies more-

09:45.657 --> 09:48.767
Hey, kid, we do not need a
vocabulary lesson right now.

09:48.777 --> 09:51.437
Right. Sorry.

09:52.437 --> 09:55.157
What was it the Yorkshire
Ripper said about his victims?

09:55.167 --> 10:00.007
The women I killed were filth, bastard
prostitutes that were littering the streets.

10:00.017 --> 10:02.047
I was just cleaning up the place a bit.

10:02.057 --> 10:03.867
He's a housecleaner.

10:03.877 --> 10:07.047
Mission-based killer who believes
his murders are helping society.

10:07.057 --> 10:10.127
These guys devolve rapidly until
they're just killing machines.

10:10.137 --> 10:13.037
And our hands are tied by
jurisdictional concerns?

10:13.047 --> 10:14.467
Well, what are we supposed to do?

10:14.477 --> 10:18.407
If we don't follow the city's jurisdiction,
no one's gonna ever ask us for help.

10:18.417 --> 10:21.957
We do it by the book. Then we pray...

10:22.447 --> 10:24.977
That no one else gets
hurt in the meantime.

10:41.207 --> 10:44.297
You're kidding me,right?
You got nothin' I need.

10:44.307 --> 10:46.977
Someone wants company.

10:46.987 --> 10:48.497
What, like a date?

10:48.507 --> 10:51.567
- I'm supposed to take you.
- In this?

10:51.577 --> 10:55.027
- Get in.
- Slow down.

10:55.447 --> 10:59.657
- Private party's gonna cost about 500 bucks, baby.
- Get in.

10:59.667 --> 11:03.367
But you're all right with
that, 500 bucks, cash?

11:03.377 --> 11:05.937
He'll pay. Get in.

11:05.947 --> 11:07.867
You're a twitchy little
thing, aren't you?

11:07.877 --> 11:11.737
No.Use the side door.
No one can see you.

11:11.747 --> 11:14.417
Yeah. Whatever.

11:20.007 --> 11:22.297
All right, you beautiful thing, you.

11:22.627 --> 11:24.757
Talk to me. Tell me you got
something I can work with.

11:24.767 --> 11:27.807
Oh, I wish I could, but I've
gone through 41 names so far

11:27.817 --> 11:30.797
and none of them reported
missing in any database.

11:30.807 --> 11:32.537
- Come on, girl. Not one?
- No.

11:32.547 --> 11:35.677
I even went Interpol
on it. Big fat zero.

11:35.687 --> 11:39.377
- Damn.
- It's unbelievably sad, isn't it?

11:39.907 --> 11:42.417
All right. Well, just keep
doing your thing, all right?

11:42.427 --> 11:46.077
- Let me know if you find anything with the rest of the names.
- Ok.

11:57.847 --> 12:01.857
What'd you do to yourself, girl?

12:15.497 --> 12:17.937
That driver...

12:22.227 --> 12:24.827
What is it he gave me?

12:29.637 --> 12:31.877
What the hell?

12:32.667 --> 12:37.597
You took my shoes? What
are you, some kind of freak?

12:54.137 --> 12:57.217
Let me outta here!

13:34.637 --> 13:38.357
Look, if this is your idea
of a joke, I'm not laughing.

13:50.247 --> 13:54.547
Oh, you're gonna pay for
this, freak. Believe me.

14:31.660 --> 14:34.160
I'm hurting.

14:34.170 --> 14:36.970
I cut myself.

14:37.650 --> 14:41.220
Would somebody please help me?

14:42.830 --> 14:46.490
Would somebody please help me in here?

14:58.980 --> 15:01.440
Police Department KANSAS CITY,KANSAS

15:01.450 --> 15:03.710
This is my desk over here.

15:06.060 --> 15:08.350
- Is this your commander's office?
- Yeah.

15:08.360 --> 15:11.840
- Uh, I'm-I'm gonna go
talk to him first. - Sure.

15:13.520 --> 15:17.730
This is the neatest detective's
desk I have ever seen.

15:19.240 --> 15:22.620
You did-you did
what? Call you back.

15:23.670 --> 15:26.080
I'm guessing it didn't go too well.

15:28.570 --> 15:30.010
I'm captain wright.

15:30.020 --> 15:33.970
Agent Hotchner. This is agent Jareau. We're
with the FBI's behavioral analysis unit.

15:34.860 --> 15:38.690
- Listen, guys, I don't know what detective
McGee here told you- - yes, you do.

15:39.120 --> 15:42.680
I told them that there's a large number of
people missing from my area of responsibility.

15:42.690 --> 15:45.030
No. You think there are a
large number of people missing.

15:45.040 --> 15:48.400
- We discussed this last week.
- He informed you of this before?

15:48.410 --> 15:51.010
Agents, we have run every one of
the names from his little books

15:51.020 --> 15:53.660
and we couldn't find a
single missing report.

15:53.670 --> 15:57.650
Tell him what the other agent said about- about
homeless people not going missing like this.

15:57.660 --> 15:59.490
That's not exactly what he said.

15:59.500 --> 16:04.300
Listen,guys, I-I'm really sorry you came
all this way, but we don't need any FBI help.

16:04.310 --> 16:07.280
May I have a word with
you in your office?

16:07.650 --> 16:10.870
Uh, yeah, sure. Sure. Right this way.

16:13.810 --> 16:16.590
You should have told us he already knew.

16:18.540 --> 16:22.000
Would you have come?

17:09.829 --> 17:11.670
Any news?

17:11.680 --> 17:13.730
Haven't heard from Hotch or J.J.

17:13.740 --> 17:17.210
Garcia went through all the names but couldn't
find a single report to hang an investigation on.

17:17.220 --> 17:21.020
We've been compiling preliminary profile thoughts
based on the limited victimology that we have.

17:21.030 --> 17:22.760
Profile? We don't even
have this case yet.

17:22.770 --> 17:25.030
We just want to be prepared
in case we are called in.

17:25.040 --> 17:29.600
- We don't have enough other work to do?
- Gideon, he's a housecleaner.

17:29.610 --> 17:33.550
With 63 potential victims.

17:37.030 --> 17:39.740
What have you come up with so far?

18:09.660 --> 18:11.550
I can't believe he did this.

18:11.560 --> 18:15.090
Well, detective McGee is pretty sure
that these people are missing, sir.

18:15.100 --> 18:18.430
- Now, detective McGee is...
- A little obsessive-compulsive?

18:18.440 --> 18:22.020
- Oh, you noticed that, huh?
- Doesn't mean he can't be a good cop.

18:22.590 --> 18:26.820
I thought assigning him to keep an
eye on skid row would be harmless.

18:26.830 --> 18:30.270
Well, most of those people only
cause trouble for each other.

18:36.720 --> 18:39.330
Is this the envelope the letter came in?

18:39.630 --> 18:42.480
Yeah. They dusted for
prints. It's clean.

18:48.400 --> 18:51.780
You've only been a cop for 4 years
and you're already a detective.

18:51.790 --> 18:56.060
Yeah, they, uh...Promoted me to
keep me away from the general public.

18:56.300 --> 18:58.920
That's why I'm baby-sitting skid row.

18:59.700 --> 19:02.300
Look, I'm sorry he got you
to travel all the way here.

19:02.310 --> 19:04.590
Sir, we're happy to
help with the problem.

19:05.330 --> 19:06.970
What problem?

19:06.980 --> 19:11.000
Sir, 63 people missing from
a localized area is unusual.

19:11.010 --> 19:15.350
Are you kiddin' me?
Bums, whores, junkies.

19:15.750 --> 19:17.440
Can these people even be missing?

19:17.450 --> 19:20.020
You seem hostile to the idea that
these people could be in trouble.

19:20.030 --> 19:24.440
No, what I'm hostile to is a member of my
command recruiting the FBI to handle a case

19:24.450 --> 19:25.880
that I don't even believe is happening.

19:25.890 --> 19:29.310
You know, the note he received could be
an unsub reaching out. It's not uncommon.

19:29.320 --> 19:32.340
Or it could be another cop who's
pissed off that McGee got an award.

19:32.350 --> 19:35.030
Sir, this type of unsub is
relatively easy to catch.

19:35.040 --> 19:38.200
- Nobody else has to get hurt.
- As far as I know, no one has been hurt.

19:38.210 --> 19:43.070
I have some experience in this field, and I
believe that your problem's only going to get worse.

19:43.080 --> 19:45.680
Oh, well, thank you.
We'll keep an eye on that.

19:45.690 --> 19:47.720
You have a safe trip home.

19:47.730 --> 19:49.430
- What if they were cheerleaders?
- Excuse me?

19:49.440 --> 19:51.370
Or teachers? Or mothers?

19:51.380 --> 19:54.060
How did you put it? Can bums even
be missing? Well, sir, they can.

19:54.070 --> 19:57.030
They can be hurt,they can be
scared, and they can be killed.

19:57.040 --> 20:00.700
- You must really care about these people.
- It's my job to care about them.

20:02.640 --> 20:06.080
Most cops would say it's
their job to keep 'em in line.

20:06.090 --> 20:08.830
Yeah, well, my father taught me
to be a different kind of cop.

20:08.840 --> 20:11.640
Was he a detective, too?

20:11.650 --> 20:15.310
Yeah,he was a- he was killed
in the line of duty in '85.

20:16.020 --> 20:17.890
I'm sorry.

20:17.900 --> 20:20.860
Captain Wright was his partner.

20:20.870 --> 20:23.270
It's the only reason the
department keeps me on.

20:23.280 --> 20:25.720
I'm sure that's not the only...

20:28.330 --> 20:31.160
- This postmark.
- Excuse me?

20:31.170 --> 20:32.710
- Kansas City.
- Right.

20:32.720 --> 20:34.740
Missouri. We're in Kansas City, Kansas.

20:34.750 --> 20:36.850
Yeah, well, they're just across
the river from one another.

20:36.860 --> 20:40.030
No, what they are is right
across the state line.

20:43.270 --> 20:45.520
- Hotch, it's federal.
- What?

20:45.530 --> 20:47.360
If we want this case,
it's ours. It's federal.

20:47.370 --> 20:50.520
This letter came from across the
river, from Kansas City, Missouri.

20:50.530 --> 20:53.040
- Interstate communication.
- Puts it in federal jurisdiction.

20:53.050 --> 20:56.690
Sir, this is now a federal case. I would like
to retain detective McGee as a consultant.

20:56.970 --> 20:59.800
You're not opening any
investigations in my jurisdiction.

20:59.810 --> 21:02.470
I don't want a fight with you.
Even though this is a federal case,

21:02.480 --> 21:05.980
If we develop any information, I will come
to you and your men will make the arrest.

21:05.990 --> 21:07.850
And why would you do that?

21:07.860 --> 21:10.500
Because that's how we operate.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.920
Anybody there?

21:43.820 --> 21:46.800
Hello? I cut myself in here.

21:46.810 --> 21:49.410
Is somebody there?

21:53.650 --> 21:56.410
- Do you wish to know the future?
- What?

21:56.420 --> 22:00.680
Would you like to see exactly
how your day is going to end?

22:15.860 --> 22:18.640
Oh, god, no. No.

22:33.143 --> 22:36.953
Oh, please, I have a baby

22:36.963 --> 22:39.623
Her name is Sheila May. Please.

22:39.633 --> 22:42.623
I just want to go see my daughter.

22:44.273 --> 22:46.753
I know you're there.

22:47.333 --> 22:51.743
Why-why are you doing this
to me? What did I do to you?

22:52.103 --> 22:54.673
What did you do?

22:54.683 --> 22:57.573
What is the legacy of a whore, Maggie?

22:58.853 --> 23:02.773
Aids, syphilis, gonorrhea, herpes

23:02.783 --> 23:06.623
hepatitis, disease, and filth.

23:06.633 --> 23:08.493
What did you do?

23:08.503 --> 23:12.463
- You...Were...You.

23:22.423 --> 23:25.553
- B.A.U.
- I'm Jason Gideon.

23:25.563 --> 23:28.853
- Agents Morgan, Prentiss, and dr. Reid.
- Captain alright.

23:28.863 --> 23:32.653
If you, uh, want to get your squad together,
captain, we could start giving the profile.

23:32.923 --> 23:35.063
- Already?
- We've been working on it all day.

23:35.073 --> 23:38.883
- Oh, have you, now?
- Just out of an abundance of preparedness, yeah.

23:38.893 --> 23:41.633
Give me a few minutes, guys, huh?

23:42.443 --> 23:44.083
I'm not sure if he's
really ok with this,

23:44.093 --> 23:47.513
or he's sure we're wrong and wants
to see us embarrass ourselves.

23:50.553 --> 23:52.913
I don't have any diseases.

23:52.923 --> 23:55.873
I just went to the clinic. I'm clean.

23:55.883 --> 23:58.963
You don't even know
the meaning of the word.

24:00.093 --> 24:03.253
Now, you have been judged
and sentenced...To death.

24:03.663 --> 24:06.923
No. Pl-please, don't kill me.

24:06.933 --> 24:09.743
I have a daughter. I
will do anything you want.

24:09.753 --> 24:13.003
I assure you, I'm not
without compassion.

24:13.013 --> 24:17.303
You are roughly in the center of
a 130,000-square-foot facility.

24:18.043 --> 24:21.113
You have until sunrise to
find your way out of here.

24:21.483 --> 24:25.973
If you don't, your sentence
will be carried out.

24:26.593 --> 24:29.513
You only have a few hours,maggie.

24:31.453 --> 24:34.663
We're going to provide a psychological
profile of the man we're looking for.

24:34.673 --> 24:39.983
It contains some unusual, specific personality
traits that someone out there is bound to recognize.

24:40.363 --> 24:43.243
Which will make him
relatively easy to locate.

24:43.253 --> 24:48.493
Long-lasting, negative impression
he leaves on anyone he might meet.

25:19.443 --> 25:22.433
We have a term for the killing
behavior this unsub displays-

25:22.443 --> 25:26.523
Cleaning house- fixing
what's wrong with the world.

25:26.533 --> 25:30.803
He's deeply rationalized this behavior, and
while he certainly knows the killing is wrong,

25:30.813 --> 25:34.283
he truly believes that he's
doing the world a great service.

25:34.293 --> 25:37.203
Ultimately, this type
of unsub becomes a loner.

25:37.213 --> 25:39.243
There will not be too many people
that can still tolerate him.

25:39.253 --> 25:43.313
Now, if he does have a relationship at
all, the person will not be his equal.

25:43.323 --> 25:45.253
It'll be someone subservient to him.

25:45.263 --> 25:49.173
He'll be fastidious, tending toward obsessive
- compulsive disorder,

25:49.183 --> 25:53.363
and he'll have an overwhelming sense of indignation
towards the things that he's judged to be wrong.

25:53.373 --> 25:56.143
He wouldn't even consider the reasons
why someone might disagree with him.

25:56.153 --> 26:00.013
- He sounds like a real jagoff.
- Exactly. Class-a scumbag.

26:00.023 --> 26:03.773
Detective McGee started noticing
the disappearances a year ago.

26:03.783 --> 26:06.273
The unsub probably had
a stressor at this time-

26:06.283 --> 26:10.933
the death of a family member or someone
who had some semblance of control over him.

26:10.943 --> 26:14.043
Right now, no one has control over him.

26:15.383 --> 26:19.183
It's probable that he isn't currently
working after this many victims

26:19.193 --> 26:24.633
And the devolution that it brings a job just
wouldn't leave him time to practice his true calling.

26:24.643 --> 26:29.903
- Which is...
- A predator, a killing machine.

26:30.553 --> 26:33.243
By now, it's become all he thinks about.

27:07.793 --> 27:11.193
It's not fair, you son of a bitch!

28:00.953 --> 28:02.743
SLAUGHTERHOUSE

28:20.144 --> 28:21.384
What are you lookin' at?

28:21.394 --> 28:23.284
Just want to ask you a
few questions, my man.

28:23.294 --> 28:27.634
- About what?
- Unfamiliar faces walking around here.

29:11.164 --> 29:14.024
Is there anything I can do for
you? Get you to a shelter, maybe?

29:14.034 --> 29:16.304
Have you ever seen one of them shelters?

29:16.314 --> 29:18.414
I'll take my chances in the park.

29:18.424 --> 29:20.614
At least I got the
birds I can feed there.

29:20.624 --> 29:22.824
Ok. Ok, I understand.

29:22.834 --> 29:24.744
Be careful, you hear me?

29:24.754 --> 29:28.654
This world needs all of its beautiful
ladies, and that means you, too, Mona.

29:33.034 --> 29:35.564
You're a good guy.

29:35.574 --> 29:37.404
- You think?
- Yeah.

29:37.414 --> 29:40.014
You make the people
around you feel good.

29:40.024 --> 29:41.904
Well, he's no Charlie Chaplin.

29:41.914 --> 29:43.994
- Again with the Chaplins.
- How'd you guys do?

29:44.004 --> 29:46.384
Well, Reid got propositioned
by every prostitute we talked to

29:46.394 --> 29:48.794
but we didn't find anybody who
thinks they'd seen the unsub.

29:48.804 --> 29:51.654
- Same story with us.
- We saw Gideon and McGee a block back.

29:51.664 --> 29:53.474
- They hadn't had any luck, either.
- It's odd.

29:53.484 --> 29:55.524
If the unsub were out
here, he'd stand out.

29:55.534 --> 29:58.504
- You know, people would recognize the description.
- So where does that leave us?

29:58.514 --> 30:01.244
Right where I thought we were.

30:01.254 --> 30:04.514
- Captain?
- You said this guy would definitely be memorable.

30:04.524 --> 30:05.944
You were adamant.

30:05.954 --> 30:09.684
So if no one out here remembers him,
according to you, he doesn't exist.

30:09.694 --> 30:12.634
- That's not exactly what we
said, but- - It's what you implied.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.214
What do you think
happened to them, captain?

30:14.224 --> 30:16.484
I told you, I don't think
anything happened to them.

30:16.494 --> 30:18.664
Oh,that's right. You think
they all got houses and jobs.

30:18.674 --> 30:21.884
Ok, all this means is we have
another piece of the puzzle here.

30:21.894 --> 30:26.534
Someone got over 60 street-smart
people out of here and no one noticed.

30:26.544 --> 30:28.344
It's almost like he blended in.

30:28.354 --> 30:31.744
It's more than that. It's
like he must somehow belong.

30:31.754 --> 30:34.814
- Like he's here all the time.
- Like social services.

30:34.824 --> 30:35.914
What?

30:35.924 --> 30:37.564
- Captain Wright.
- Yeah?

30:37.574 --> 30:40.704
- Does your social services department patrol around?
- Excuse me?

30:40.714 --> 30:42.944
Do they drive around in the middle of
the night looking for people to help?

30:42.954 --> 30:45.794
No. They have to be
called, and then-

30:45.804 --> 30:48.224
Morgan!

30:48.484 --> 30:51.824
Mona! Mona, wait a minute!
Do not get in that van!

30:53.134 --> 30:55.554
What are you doing? I thought
you didn't need any help.

30:55.564 --> 30:57.934
He's gonna drive me to the park.

30:58.304 --> 31:00.274
Hey, how's it goin', my man?

31:00.284 --> 31:02.384
- I should go.
- Slow down. What's your hurry?

31:02.394 --> 31:04.234
I got a lot of work. I should go.

31:04.244 --> 31:07.504
- Sir, do you have a city employee I.D.
- Look, I really don't have time for this.

31:07.514 --> 31:10.044
Yes, you do. I.D., Please.

31:16.474 --> 31:19.124
Out of the truck! Out of
the truck! Get out here!

31:21.204 --> 31:23.534
All right, all right! Don't hurt me!

31:23.544 --> 31:25.634
Just...Don't hurt me.

31:37.814 --> 31:40.324
Oh, no way.

32:52.424 --> 32:55.814
Please.
I just-

33:53.224 --> 33:55.454
No! No.

34:10.164 --> 34:12.984
Not fair.

34:27.784 --> 34:30.364
I don't-I didn't
do anything.

34:35.293 --> 34:38.353
Everything's good. It's
good. It's good. He's good.

34:40.074 --> 34:42.114
He's terrified.

34:42.654 --> 34:45.114
- Of us?
- Of the unsub.

34:48.664 --> 34:51.184
Garcia couldn't find
much on this guy at all.

34:51.194 --> 34:54.804
No employment records, no tax records,
no credit cards, no bank accounts.

34:55.514 --> 34:58.894
The van is registered to a paper
corporation out of the Cayman Islands.

34:58.904 --> 35:02.934
Other than having a valid driver's
license, Steven Foster has no paper trail.

35:02.944 --> 35:06.284
My guess is he's devoted his
entire life to helping the unsub.

35:06.784 --> 35:09.944
Unsub takes care of everything for him.

35:09.954 --> 35:13.404
In return, Steven
provides fresh victims.

35:14.054 --> 35:16.154
So how do you know there's another guy?

35:16.164 --> 35:19.374
Does he look like he could
cleanly pull off 63 murders?

35:19.384 --> 35:23.234
So if he's his accomplice,
why is he so afraid of the guy?

35:23.244 --> 35:26.724
Steven's the only person in the world
truly aware of what the unsub is capable of.

35:27.184 --> 35:30.014
The only one still alive.

35:41.194 --> 35:45.224
Sadism and torture invariably
get worse with every victim.

35:45.704 --> 35:49.224
That's why this was so important. We couldn't
take the chance that it wasn't happening.

35:51.814 --> 35:54.654
- That's him?
- He's not the unsub.

35:55.064 --> 35:58.934
- Well,then- then who is he? - Only
relationship the unsub has left in the world.

35:58.944 --> 36:00.014
His only friend.

36:00.024 --> 36:02.974
Did you want me to publicize the
arrest, put some pressure on the unsub?

36:02.984 --> 36:04.454
No. He might run.

36:04.464 --> 36:07.564
Ok, so, uh, how we gonna find him, then?

36:07.574 --> 36:10.284
Steven's gonna tell us where he is.

36:36.584 --> 36:38.314
Well, finally!

36:38.924 --> 36:41.644
You took your damn time, didn't you?

36:44.124 --> 36:47.714
What the hell am I doin' here,
anyways? I didn't do nothin'.

36:48.924 --> 36:51.794
I mean, what's the charges?
Do you even have any?

36:52.534 --> 36:55.254
What did I do, offer to help an
old lady get a-get to a park?

36:55.264 --> 36:58.974
Is that even illegal? I don't think so.

36:58.984 --> 37:04.844
Should be getting some kind of award instead of
sitting in here waiting for you to decide to talk to me.

37:05.344 --> 37:07.064
I know you're gonna...

37:07.074 --> 37:10.314
Charge me with that wreck,
right, crashing into that car?

37:10.324 --> 37:14.164
That was the other cop's
fault, the black guy?

37:16.434 --> 37:20.594
He jumped into my van. He
caused me to- it was his fault.

37:22.084 --> 37:26.704
It- it wasn't me. It was-
there were witnesses, you know.

37:26.714 --> 37:29.174
Sit down.

37:35.514 --> 37:39.714
I've been standing on the other side of that
glass thinking about what to do with you, Steven.

37:40.934 --> 37:44.004
And this morning I
decided to save your life.

37:44.014 --> 37:46.654
You're gonna tell me where my killer is.

37:46.664 --> 37:51.504
You're gonna give me an address, and you're gonna
tell me how to get inside without raising an alarm.

37:51.514 --> 37:54.704
You're gonna draw me
a map if I need one.

37:54.714 --> 37:58.244
And you're gonna do this because
he's never been nice to you.

37:59.214 --> 38:02.524
He constantly insults
you and belittles you.

38:02.534 --> 38:07.834
He emasculates you and makes you
feel ugly and stupid and worthless.

38:07.844 --> 38:10.114
Nothing you ever do is right.

38:10.124 --> 38:12.994
Never good enough.

38:14.734 --> 38:17.134
You hate him, Steven.

38:18.514 --> 38:22.464
And you're also going to tell me because
you know you screwed up last night.

38:23.054 --> 38:27.344
He told you that your paramount concern was
not to attract the attention of the authorities

38:27.354 --> 38:30.804
and you know the
punishment will be severe.

38:31.214 --> 38:35.524
Nobody knows better than
you what he can do to people.

38:36.584 --> 38:40.804
I've spent a long time studying monsters
like your friend, and I can promise you...

38:41.754 --> 38:45.564
He's gonna do things to you
that even you can't imagine.

38:50.834 --> 38:53.504
I can't.

38:55.144 --> 39:00.124
My family's always worked for
his family. It's all I know.

39:02.174 --> 39:06.384
His father died last year and left
everything to him, all the money, all the...

39:07.934 --> 39:10.604
He-he's
the last one.

39:13.004 --> 39:17.004
He-he changed
after. He's different.

39:18.624 --> 39:22.034
He's... Meaner.

39:27.374 --> 39:30.324
He's gonna hurt me so bad.

39:30.334 --> 39:32.714
Not if we lock him up.

39:34.394 --> 39:37.994
Not if you tell us how
we can put him away.

39:42.034 --> 39:43.924
Holcombe.

39:45.814 --> 39:48.824
His-his name is
Charles Holcombe.

39:51.214 --> 39:54.464
He owns the old meatpacking plant.

40:15.184 --> 40:19.224
Are you gonna hide your
face from me? Coward.

40:20.654 --> 40:22.564
That old man was begging.

40:22.574 --> 40:25.874
I'm not gonna give you
that, you son of a bitch.

40:26.254 --> 40:30.064
I'm not gonna beg you for anything.

40:41.564 --> 40:44.094
But you will beg, whore.

40:44.464 --> 40:46.624
They all do.

40:46.634 --> 40:49.034
- Charles Holcombe!
- FBI

40:50.894 --> 40:53.804
- Don't do it.
- Let me do my job!

41:00.654 --> 41:03.624
It's ok, It's ok. Look at me

41:03.634 --> 41:06.174
You're all right. It's over.

41:09.164 --> 41:12.114
- The face.
- You've got some cuts, but you're gonna be ok.

41:12.124 --> 41:16.764
No. I want to see his face.

41:18.034 --> 41:20.344
Morgan.

41:29.294 --> 41:32.114
I won.

41:36.094 --> 41:38.144
There's an ambulance outside.

41:38.154 --> 41:41.224
Can you have someone check on my baby?

41:41.234 --> 41:45.794
My mom's baby-sitting her, and-
and I didn't get home last night.

41:45.804 --> 41:49.294
- We'll take care of it.
- Thank you.

42:47.774 --> 42:52.924
Nothing is permanent in this
wicked world, not even our troubles.

42:54.614 --> 42:56.984
