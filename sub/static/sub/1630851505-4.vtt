in David Hodges' storage unit.

01:54.810 --> 01:57.378
I didn't sign
a redacted report back then,

It's really
pretty simple.

You either
made an error in oversight

02:11.174 --> 02:14.177

cooked alive

03:51.622 --> 03:53.233
he would've curled
into a fetal position

03:53.276 --> 03:54.408

03:54.451 --> 03:56.236
So he was killed, then dumped.

Have to go meet with his family.

09:57.422 --> 09:59.120
Would you settle for me?

10:01.470 --> 10:03.907
If I have to.

10:03.951 --> 10:05.300
Why would someone do this?

10:05.343 --> 10:07.389
Everyone just loved JJ.

10:07.432 --> 10:10.000
Did JJ have anyone
who would want to hurt him?

10:10.044 --> 10:11.611
No one.

10:11.654 --> 10:15.440
I mean, he was just a light
in this world. I mean...

10:15.484 --> 10:17.268
he was a light in our world.

10:17.312 --> 10:19.662
He donated his kidney
to a friend

10:19.706 --> 10:21.925
of a friend for goodness sakes.

10:21.969 --> 10:23.971
Was there any unusual behavior

10:24.014 --> 10:26.538
from JJ recently,
anything at all?

10:26.582 --> 10:28.540
He did quit the hotel.

10:28.584 --> 10:31.543
He was being groomed to
replace me as a CEO eventually.

10:31.587 --> 10:34.634
Last week he just... I don't
know, he just up and quit.

10:34.677 --> 10:37.462
I think it has something
to do with Roy.

10:37.506 --> 10:39.377
Our GM.

10:39.421 --> 10:41.684
He and JJ didn't get along.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.947
Mr. Kahale?

10:43.991 --> 10:45.949
I saw him at the luau.

10:45.993 --> 10:48.386
It's not easy
to go out on your own.

10:48.430 --> 10:50.954
So I, I was...

10:50.998 --> 10:53.217
I was proud of JJ, but...

10:53.261 --> 10:55.132
truth be told, I thought
he'd be back in a week.

10:55.176 --> 10:58.005
[crying]:
He's never coming back.

11:03.227 --> 11:04.315
[siren wailing]

11:17.720 --> 11:20.505
Are you okay?

11:20.549 --> 11:23.334
Yeah, I'm okay.

11:23.378 --> 11:25.380
Are you okay?

11:28.644 --> 11:30.733
Let's go home.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.735
[engine starts]

11:36.652 --> 11:39.220
Would you mind
if I ask you a question?

11:39.263 --> 11:42.179
Could we just jump
to the fireworks?

11:42.223 --> 11:46.009
I mean, you wanted to meet
because I signed off

11:46.053 --> 11:48.229
on bad stuff that Hodges
supposedly did, right?

11:48.272 --> 11:50.753
When are you going
to show me those files?

11:50.797 --> 11:53.364
Accuse me of being complicit...Actually,

11:53.408 --> 11:55.366
none of the 12 cases
Hodges tampered with

11:55.410 --> 11:57.368
happened under your watch.

11:57.412 --> 11:58.979
So congrats.

11:59.022 --> 12:01.198
Main reason I wanted
to sit with you is

12:01.242 --> 12:03.374
nobody worked
with Hodges longer than you.

12:03.418 --> 12:05.463
Just want to go through,
get an account of everything

12:05.507 --> 12:07.291
you observed...Well, then I can

12:07.335 --> 12:09.380
speed things up.
I never saw anything.

12:09.424 --> 12:12.079
Hodges is a good man.
He was a great lab tech.

12:12.122 --> 12:14.777
He's professional...Listen. Friendly advice.

12:14.821 --> 12:16.648
You don't want to start offering
character testimony

12:16.692 --> 12:18.563
for the accused-- you do that,

12:18.607 --> 12:21.741
D.A.'s got no choice
but to impugn your character.

12:21.784 --> 12:24.091
What's wrong with my character?

12:29.618 --> 12:32.229
"Sara Sidle's temperament
can be an issue.

12:32.273 --> 12:34.231
"She has blind spots.

12:34.275 --> 12:36.494
"An inability to channel
emotional energy stands

12:36.538 --> 12:38.758
in the way of her becoming
the best CSI she can be."

12:38.801 --> 12:40.150
What's that from?

12:40.194 --> 12:42.065
A performance review
written just before

12:42.109 --> 12:43.675
the Chase investigation.

12:43.719 --> 12:45.503
By your supervisor at the time.

12:45.547 --> 12:46.809
Gil.

12:46.853 --> 12:48.724
That's about
when you two got serious, right?

12:48.768 --> 12:50.291
That has nothing to do with it.

12:50.334 --> 12:52.772
You were distracted by an affair
that began in the workplace.

12:52.815 --> 12:54.817
That's why you failed
to notice...

12:54.861 --> 12:56.732
That is completely untrue!

12:56.776 --> 12:58.734
I didn't bring this up to rile
you. I just want you to know

12:58.778 --> 13:01.084
where it will go if you get up
on the stand and start to...

13:01.128 --> 13:02.607
What, tell the truth
about Hodges? If I do that,

13:02.651 --> 13:04.305
I'll get beat up
with my husband's own words

13:04.348 --> 13:05.610
twisted against me.

13:05.654 --> 13:07.264
Great.Got it.

13:07.308 --> 13:09.440
We're gonna finish this later.

13:09.484 --> 13:11.094
I got to get
back to work.

13:11.138 --> 13:13.444
On what, exactly?

13:13.488 --> 13:14.663
Murder at a luau.

13:14.706 --> 13:16.621
Why don't you ask around?

13:18.406 --> 13:20.669
You should know
that wasn't all of it.

13:20.712 --> 13:23.628
"If Sara masters her demons,

13:23.672 --> 13:27.284
"she'll thrive as a CSI
for as long as she wants.

13:27.328 --> 13:29.678
She's made for this job."

13:29.721 --> 13:31.811
Great.

13:34.248 --> 13:36.467
I always wanted
to go to a luau.

13:36.511 --> 13:38.861
I'm not sure
sifting through dirt

13:38.905 --> 13:41.472
from a barbecue pit
really counts.

13:43.910 --> 13:46.260
When you were sailing around
in the South Pacific,

13:46.303 --> 13:48.131
did you miss all this?

13:48.175 --> 13:49.437
The glamour?

13:50.742 --> 13:53.267
Some people say I was
made for this job.

13:58.489 --> 14:00.491
Got something here.

14:00.535 --> 14:02.667
Not sure what this
white powder is.

14:10.545 --> 14:11.894
It's cyanuric acid.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.461
It's hard to imagine
what it would be

14:13.504 --> 14:14.679
doing in a barbecue pit.

14:14.723 --> 14:16.203
Why? What is it?

14:16.246 --> 14:18.640
It's mostly used
to sanitize high-traffic pools.

14:18.683 --> 14:21.904
You know, I met a man who was
dealing with the hotel pool.

14:21.948 --> 14:25.342
JJ might not be the only thing
we pulled out of the ground.

14:26.909 --> 14:29.738
I think we just dug up
a suspect, too.

14:40.314 --> 14:42.577
CARSON:
Good-looking pool, Mr. Kahale.

14:44.274 --> 14:46.886
What do y'all use
to keep it clean?

14:46.929 --> 14:49.845
I don't, uh-- I don't know.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.891
You said you were down here
dealing with some problem

14:51.934 --> 14:53.544
with the pool
the night of the murder.

14:53.588 --> 14:56.417
We found cyanuric acid
next to the victim's blood

14:56.460 --> 14:57.809
in the sand next to the pit.

14:57.853 --> 15:00.203
What does that mean?I can't say with certainty.

15:00.247 --> 15:01.552
But I think it means someone
who was dealing

15:01.596 --> 15:03.206
with the pool is involved.

15:03.250 --> 15:04.904
Let me be square with you.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.949
I knew it was JJ
in the pit.

15:06.993 --> 15:09.386
I knew when I saw
those red shoes of his.

15:09.430 --> 15:10.561
And you didn't say anything?

15:10.605 --> 15:12.302
I didn't want anyone
to get the wrong idea.

15:12.346 --> 15:13.782
Well, we now think
you might've murdered a man

15:13.825 --> 15:15.653
and roasted
his corpse.

15:15.697 --> 15:17.742
You think that's the right idea?

15:17.786 --> 15:19.919
Why don't you show us where
you keep your pool chemicals?

15:22.356 --> 15:24.271
Hey, Kai?

15:24.314 --> 15:25.968
You got a key
to the maintenance room?

15:29.798 --> 15:32.409
You might hear from some people,

15:32.453 --> 15:34.281
JJ and I butted heads.

15:34.324 --> 15:35.935
But I swear I didn't kill him.

15:35.978 --> 15:38.285
Well, JJ's parents said
you two didn't get along.

15:38.328 --> 15:40.374
Why is that?

15:40.417 --> 15:41.723
Well, maybe 'cause
he was a rapist.

15:41.766 --> 15:43.290
Kai, enough!

15:43.333 --> 15:45.770
Honestly, you people should
just go home, take the win!

15:45.814 --> 15:47.250
Karma got him!

15:47.294 --> 15:48.991
Look, Roy, you know
how much I need this job,

15:49.035 --> 15:50.427
but I'm not gonna
stay quiet.

15:50.471 --> 15:52.255
What are you talking about?

15:52.299 --> 15:53.778
JJ raped my girlfriend,
Rachel Koa.

15:53.822 --> 15:55.302
What?

15:55.345 --> 15:57.913
Did JJ's mommy and daddy
not tell you?

15:57.957 --> 16:00.220
Honestly, it figures you guys
don't know, they probably

16:00.263 --> 16:01.438
had the records erased.

16:01.482 --> 16:02.787
Can we speak with Rachel?

16:02.831 --> 16:04.964
No. You can't.

16:05.007 --> 16:06.966
She reported JJ
to the police,

16:07.009 --> 16:09.272
but his family had lawyers.

16:09.316 --> 16:11.796
They made her take it back
or they were gonna ruin her.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.451
Which they did
anyway, so...

16:14.495 --> 16:17.454
She lost her job,
she was banned from the hotel.

16:17.498 --> 16:19.413
Lost friends.

16:19.456 --> 16:21.328
She OD'd two weeks ago.

16:22.677 --> 16:24.592
JJ was scum.

16:24.635 --> 16:27.073
Whoever killed him
did the world a favor.

16:29.510 --> 16:32.513
It's not enough
to hold either of them.

16:32.556 --> 16:35.429
But Carson's looking
into Kai's alibi.

16:35.472 --> 16:37.039
Roy's, too.

16:37.083 --> 16:39.911
You know, part of me
hopes they hold up.Yeah?

16:39.955 --> 16:41.826
JJ ended up
on top of a pig.

16:41.870 --> 16:43.480
Whoever put him there
went too far, but...

16:43.524 --> 16:45.004
they had
their reasons.

16:45.047 --> 16:47.832
Okay, Rachel's rape kit
will still be on file

16:47.876 --> 16:50.009
even though she withdrew
her claim.

16:50.052 --> 16:52.359
Process it.I pulled Rachel Koa's
statement.

16:52.402 --> 16:54.578
Here's how it went down
according to her.

16:54.622 --> 16:56.711
She and JJ had drinks
after work.

16:56.754 --> 16:59.757
Next thing she knows he's
pulling her into a hotel room.

16:59.801 --> 17:02.238
Ripped off her necklace
in the process.

17:02.282 --> 17:04.980
He was just too strong.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.374
A golden boy
with no enemies, huh?

17:07.417 --> 17:08.549
JJ's parents lied to me.

17:08.592 --> 17:09.854
They banned Rachel

17:09.898 --> 17:11.682
and her whole family
from the hotel.

17:11.726 --> 17:14.424
Their son was a rapist
and they covered it up.

17:14.468 --> 17:16.078
Allegedrapist, Allie.

17:16.122 --> 17:17.732
No matter what JJ may

17:17.775 --> 17:19.560
or may not have done
in the past,

17:19.603 --> 17:21.518
he is the victim here.

17:21.562 --> 17:22.911
Of course.

17:22.954 --> 17:24.695
You're right.Okay.

17:24.739 --> 17:27.742
So it says here
that Rachel had a half sister.

17:27.785 --> 17:30.353
A professor
at West Las Vegas, so

17:30.397 --> 17:32.877
if you're right about motive...She might know more
people who fit.

17:32.921 --> 17:35.010
So get a list-- um, someone

17:35.054 --> 17:36.577
who is strong enough
to carry the body,

17:36.620 --> 17:38.796
someone who works
with cyanuric acid,

17:38.840 --> 17:41.451
someone who's capable
of butchering JJ

17:41.495 --> 17:42.757
and dumping him.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.585
Yep.

17:51.113 --> 17:53.724
We need to talk.

17:53.768 --> 17:56.771
Dr. Roby, I'm concerned you
may have made a serious mistake.

17:56.814 --> 17:59.382
Rehiring Sara Sidle
and Gil Grissom?

17:59.426 --> 18:00.688
They aren't
on trial.

18:00.731 --> 18:02.777
David Hodges is.You're right.

18:02.820 --> 18:04.735
But they're both
all wrapped up in his case.

18:04.779 --> 18:06.520
Maybe you're not concerned
about optics...

18:06.563 --> 18:08.783
I'm very concerned about optics.

18:08.826 --> 18:11.046
When people see this lab,

18:11.090 --> 18:13.004
I want them to know
we get it right.

18:13.048 --> 18:15.616
There is an assault
on the truth out there.

18:15.659 --> 18:17.705
Not yourtruth,
not mytruth.

18:17.748 --> 18:19.141
But thetruth.

18:19.185 --> 18:21.056
And you think
they're telling the truth?

18:21.100 --> 18:23.493
I think that when I get
a chance to hire people--

18:23.537 --> 18:26.148
people of talent,
people with integrity--

18:26.192 --> 18:29.151
I'm gonna do it...

18:29.195 --> 18:31.153
every single time.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.676
To do what? Specifically.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.548
That's what I'm here to ask.

18:34.591 --> 18:36.158
They're telling me
they got

18:36.202 --> 18:37.942
an animal cruelty case
and something to do

18:37.986 --> 18:39.422
with a barbecued pig?

18:39.466 --> 18:40.989
They were telling the truth.

18:41.032 --> 18:43.600
Do you want to see the files?
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:43.644 --> 18:45.776
Do you even have the authority
to ask to see them?

18:48.475 --> 18:50.607
When this is over--

18:50.651 --> 18:52.957
when Sara Sidle
and Gil Grissom's testimony

18:53.001 --> 18:57.701
helps the D.A. put
David Hodges where he belongs--

18:57.745 --> 18:59.747
I hope you're
still sitting there.

18:59.790 --> 19:01.488
Where you belong.

19:06.884 --> 19:09.583
♪

19:19.636 --> 19:22.204
Honestly, have you ever seen

19:22.248 --> 19:24.467
anything like these incisions?

19:24.511 --> 19:26.165
Mm-mm.

19:29.211 --> 19:31.822
It's not just the rape
that I blame him for.

19:31.866 --> 19:34.738
JJ got Rachel into drugs,
parties.

19:34.782 --> 19:36.784
She wasn't made
for that life.

19:36.827 --> 19:38.916
And now she's gone.

19:38.960 --> 19:41.484
Was it just you and Rachel here?

19:41.528 --> 19:43.486
We have some extended family
in Vegas.

19:43.530 --> 19:45.184
Course, I know
why you're asking.

19:45.227 --> 19:47.490
Rachel's friends and family
have motive, right?

19:47.534 --> 19:49.100
I mean, it's definitely possible
JJ's death was revenge

19:49.144 --> 19:50.798
for what he did.

19:50.841 --> 19:52.669
You think he just did it
to Rachel?

19:52.713 --> 19:55.063
Nobody else's family
might want a piece of him?

19:55.106 --> 19:58.762
We're only aware of the one...
crime.

19:58.806 --> 19:59.850
Is there anyone
you could think of

19:59.894 --> 20:01.200
who would do
something like this?

20:01.243 --> 20:02.984
Have you ever been homesick?

20:05.639 --> 20:07.858
Rachel was homesick.

20:07.902 --> 20:10.252
But I brought her here.
It was my idea.

20:10.296 --> 20:13.081
I thought we'd have more
opportunities in Vegas.

20:13.124 --> 20:16.040
Whoever did this, and I really
don't know who they are,

20:16.084 --> 20:19.130
they gave me a gift
when JJ died.

20:19.174 --> 20:21.698
I can shut my eyes
in peace at night.

20:21.742 --> 20:25.049
I wish I could help you, but...

20:28.836 --> 20:31.534
You remind me of one
of my students from Kauai.

20:31.578 --> 20:34.058
Your mana... it's good.

20:34.102 --> 20:36.060
There's a quiet
about you.

20:36.104 --> 20:38.976
I'd say good luck
but instead, I'll say,

20:39.020 --> 20:41.849
"Take care of your silence,
Allie."

20:41.892 --> 20:43.938
Aloha.

This is not...

21:17.667 --> 21:19.756
what I had in mind tonight.

21:19.800 --> 21:21.671
Homework.

21:21.715 --> 21:23.194
Far from prying eyes.

21:23.238 --> 21:25.109
I borrowed some stuff
from the lab.

21:25.153 --> 21:27.590
I bet you got some fun looks
from the people downstairs

21:27.634 --> 21:30.767
in the casino while you were
wheeling this stuff in.

21:30.811 --> 21:32.682
Could you check
that agarose gel?

21:32.726 --> 21:34.728
To see if I was able
to replicate this DNA?

21:34.771 --> 21:36.295
Trying to see
if Hodges could've faked

21:36.338 --> 21:38.601
the Chase evidence?

21:38.645 --> 21:40.951
The answer is,
yeah, he could've.

21:40.995 --> 21:43.258
So even with the technology we
had back then, it was possible.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.129
Whoever did
this thought

21:45.173 --> 21:47.001
of everything and
it's really starting

21:47.044 --> 21:49.090
to piss me off calling him
"whoever" all the time.

21:49.133 --> 21:51.353
How was your meeting
with, uh, what's her name?

21:51.397 --> 21:53.660
Oh, she's interesting.
She made it clear

21:53.703 --> 21:55.357
that we can forget
about looking at that evidence.

21:55.401 --> 21:58.317
Well, I wouldn't share it
if I was her.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.623
You're always so good
at channeling your emotions.

22:00.667 --> 22:03.670
Maintaining
a professional temperament.

22:05.062 --> 22:07.021
What is it, Sara?

22:07.064 --> 22:08.979
Detective Cross wants both of us

22:09.023 --> 22:10.677
to meet her downtown tomorrow.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.243
I'm hoping that you
could keep her

22:12.287 --> 22:14.376
in suspense a little longer

22:14.420 --> 22:16.900
while I change her mind.

22:16.944 --> 22:18.685
How are you gonna do that?

22:18.728 --> 22:20.251
We're gonna make a trade.

22:20.295 --> 22:22.079
She's gonna give you
a peek at the evidence.

22:22.123 --> 22:24.343
So you can narrow down
a list of suspects.

22:24.386 --> 22:26.257
But it has to be her idea.

22:28.825 --> 22:31.132
Oh, shoot.

22:31.175 --> 22:33.352
Oh, shoot, okay.

22:33.395 --> 22:35.441
We'll make this work.

22:37.051 --> 22:38.835
Uh-oh.

22:38.879 --> 22:40.359
What?

22:40.402 --> 22:42.056
You're making
breakfast.

22:42.099 --> 22:44.232
I mean, last time
you cooked it was...

22:44.275 --> 22:46.365
"We're moving to Vegas."

22:46.408 --> 22:49.324
First of all, that is not true,
and secondly, I make a really

22:49.368 --> 22:51.892
good Western
scramble.

22:51.935 --> 22:54.416
And thirdly, I love you, son.

22:54.460 --> 22:56.679
I love you, too.

22:56.723 --> 22:58.377
And...

22:59.943 --> 23:01.858
Mom?

23:01.902 --> 23:03.382
I know.

23:03.425 --> 23:05.384
I just heard it
from Dad again.

23:05.427 --> 23:08.125
Work twice as hard,
expect half as much.

23:08.169 --> 23:10.040
And come home.

23:10.084 --> 23:11.999
I did.

23:12.042 --> 23:14.349
[quietly]:
And you did.

23:16.395 --> 23:19.006
And you're gonna do
really good in school?

23:19.049 --> 23:20.790
Mm-hmm.

23:20.834 --> 23:21.878
And who's Kellie?

23:21.922 --> 23:23.750
Your eggs are burning.

23:23.793 --> 23:25.012
Oh, my-- you!

23:25.055 --> 23:26.317
[laughs]
Stop it!

23:26.361 --> 23:27.797
Get your plate!

23:27.841 --> 23:30.234
How we feel?
New day, fresh start?

23:30.278 --> 23:32.454
I came in early to process
Rachel's kit.

23:32.498 --> 23:34.238
Tox confirmed Rachel

23:34.282 --> 23:36.980
had GHB in her system--
a lot of it.

23:37.024 --> 23:39.418
So she was drugged
like she said she was.

23:39.461 --> 23:41.420
And there was physical evidence
of assault, no question.

23:41.463 --> 23:43.291
But...

23:46.076 --> 23:47.774
JJ was not a match.

23:47.817 --> 23:49.297
She was drugged.

23:49.340 --> 23:51.212
She must've been confused
about who attacked her.

23:51.255 --> 23:53.257
We need to find the real rapist.

23:53.301 --> 23:55.085
People thought he did it.

23:55.129 --> 23:57.261
Forget people, Allie.
What does the evidence say?

23:57.305 --> 23:59.176
Take another look
at JJ's remains.

23:59.220 --> 24:01.048
Figure out a physical profile

24:01.091 --> 24:02.441
of who caused all that damage.

24:02.484 --> 24:04.791
Check it against Roy Kahale,

24:04.834 --> 24:06.445
and all of JJ's
business partners.

24:06.488 --> 24:08.403
There's no active file
on the sexual assault.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.622
Let me open one.

24:09.665 --> 24:11.493
I can work more
than one case at a time.

24:13.321 --> 24:14.931
Look at him.

24:14.975 --> 24:17.891
This young man was
falsely accused of rape.

24:17.934 --> 24:21.155
Killed and thrown in a pit.

24:21.198 --> 24:23.940
We can come
back to Rachel.

24:23.984 --> 24:26.943
But for right now...

24:26.987 --> 24:29.337
figure out who killed that man.

24:36.518 --> 24:38.520
All the king's horses
and all the king's men

24:38.564 --> 24:40.914
couldn't do what Hugo just did.

24:40.957 --> 24:42.829
He looks great.

24:42.872 --> 24:44.395
RAMIREZ:
I can now confirm

24:44.439 --> 24:47.268
exsanguination
as cause of death.

24:47.311 --> 24:48.965
Credit where it's due,
your friend here

24:49.009 --> 24:50.314
Mr. Folsom,

24:50.358 --> 24:52.534
did not completely
beclown himself.

24:52.578 --> 24:54.493
I did all the blood loss
calculations.

24:54.536 --> 24:57.887
The most interesting thing is
where the blood spilled from.

24:57.931 --> 25:01.412
The punctured skin is so
dehydrated, I could really use

25:01.456 --> 25:03.153
a second opinion from

25:03.197 --> 25:05.852
our resident
desiccated corpse whisperer.

25:05.895 --> 25:07.549
Please don't make that a thing.

25:07.593 --> 25:10.030
Probably too long
for a nickname.

25:10.073 --> 25:11.858
RAMIREZ: The rest
were so denatured.

25:11.901 --> 25:13.381
This is the best
I could find.

25:13.424 --> 25:15.818
RAJAN:
Not too shabby. Well protected

25:15.862 --> 25:18.255
from heat,
retained some moisture.

25:18.299 --> 25:19.518
Probably from under his arm?

25:19.561 --> 25:22.042
Mm.Whisperer.

25:26.394 --> 25:29.440
Surgical slice
on one side.

25:29.484 --> 25:32.269
And torn flesh on the other.

25:32.313 --> 25:34.489
I would've guessed
a serrated blade,

25:34.533 --> 25:37.187
but it'd have to be wider
and shorter.

25:37.231 --> 25:39.015
So what we're
really looking for...

25:39.059 --> 25:40.539
is something

25:40.582 --> 25:43.280
like... this.

25:43.324 --> 25:44.934
Hmm.

25:44.978 --> 25:47.458
So Jaws treated him
like a chew toy?

25:52.246 --> 25:55.075
Wait, what are you doing?His ribs were shattered, huh?

25:55.118 --> 25:57.033
I'm sorry, Hugo.

25:57.077 --> 26:00.384
You really are an artist,
but I've got to get in there.

26:00.428 --> 26:02.473
Eh, okay.

26:26.062 --> 26:27.542
See?

26:27.586 --> 26:29.892
It's not the same color.

26:29.936 --> 26:31.198
Some of them were cooked
pretty good.

26:31.241 --> 26:33.287
We thought that
was part of his rib.
Nope.

26:33.330 --> 26:35.419
This isn't a part of JJ.

26:35.463 --> 26:38.248
This is a part
of what killed him.

26:45.342 --> 26:48.607
Aloha and e komo mai
to The Hibiscus Hotel.

26:48.650 --> 26:49.695
How may I help you?

26:49.738 --> 26:52.349
We're gonna need that weapon.

26:52.393 --> 26:54.613
We have a warrant, ma'am.Oh.

26:55.918 --> 26:58.660
Let me call maintenance
to come take it down.

26:58.704 --> 27:00.619
Is this the only one you want?

27:00.662 --> 27:01.620
There's more?

27:03.056 --> 27:05.232
[indistinct radio chatter]

27:05.275 --> 27:06.668
You know, I was actually
a little more excited

27:06.712 --> 27:08.627
about finding apotential
murder weapon.

27:08.670 --> 27:10.977
Yeah, I wasn't really
hoping for a hundred.

27:11.978 --> 27:14.154
I found these
in Roy Kahale's office.

27:14.197 --> 27:16.112
Bag, tag, put 'em with the rest.

27:17.984 --> 27:19.942
♪

27:30.213 --> 27:32.651
Not even a trace of blood.

27:32.694 --> 27:35.479
Or even a single decent
fingerprint.

27:35.523 --> 27:37.830
Either the cleaning crew at the
Hibiscus does a damn good job,

27:37.873 --> 27:39.875
or the killer did.Either way.

27:39.919 --> 27:41.790
It's still a dead end.

27:41.834 --> 27:43.705
I guess we should just move on.

27:43.749 --> 27:45.925
If we test each weapon

27:45.968 --> 27:47.970
for wound pattern,

27:48.014 --> 27:49.972
then it might tell us which...I need a minute.

27:50.016 --> 27:51.800
kind of weapon...

27:59.155 --> 28:01.157
Is this a peace offering?

28:01.201 --> 28:03.507
Or are we just never gonna
get on the same page?

28:03.551 --> 28:05.161
I'm giving peace a chance.

28:05.205 --> 28:08.077
I had some time to think about
the choices you're offering.

28:08.121 --> 28:10.123
One...

28:10.166 --> 28:12.734
throw David Hodges
into the wood chipper.

28:12.778 --> 28:15.041
Two... climb in myself.

28:15.084 --> 28:16.607
That's evocative.

28:16.651 --> 28:18.044
Not sure it's quite fair.

28:18.087 --> 28:21.177
I want to tell you
why I left yesterday, it...

28:21.221 --> 28:23.919
It's this idea you have
that Gil and I were

28:23.963 --> 28:27.009
swept up in a romance, not
paying attention to our jobs.

28:27.053 --> 28:29.142
You wouldn't be the first.Well, it wasn't like that.

28:29.185 --> 28:31.710
The work at CSI,
that-that was our passion.

28:31.753 --> 28:34.147
You know,
it's what brought us together.

28:34.190 --> 28:35.757
I just want the truth.

28:35.801 --> 28:37.890
You want me to support
the case you've built.

28:37.933 --> 28:40.719
But based on what I know,
all I could really say

28:40.762 --> 28:44.113
on the stand is
that Hodges might...

28:44.157 --> 28:47.073
have falsified DNA
as you suggest.

28:47.116 --> 28:48.988
"Might have" isn't gonna cut it.

28:49.031 --> 28:52.687
If you believe that Gil Grissom
would cheat the process,

28:52.731 --> 28:55.690
that he would jump
to a conclusion

28:55.734 --> 28:58.171
and work backwards
to get there...

28:58.214 --> 29:01.000
you're not as good at your job
as you think you are.

29:01.043 --> 29:02.871
I think you're being
a little naive.

29:02.915 --> 29:05.700
Naivete, by definition,

29:05.744 --> 29:07.876
is a lack of experience,
wisdom...

29:07.920 --> 29:09.965
judgment.

29:10.009 --> 29:11.706
The antonyms

29:11.750 --> 29:14.056
are intelligence, perception,

29:14.100 --> 29:15.884
enlightenment.

29:15.928 --> 29:17.581
And that would be my wife.

29:17.625 --> 29:18.931
You know, I don't usually have

29:18.974 --> 29:21.020
this much trouble
bringing a man around.

29:21.063 --> 29:22.761
Tell me about it.

29:22.804 --> 29:24.980
It took me years.

29:25.024 --> 29:26.895
He didn't understand
my temper.

29:26.939 --> 29:29.028
He didn't understand why I
would get emotional on the job.

29:29.071 --> 29:30.986
You read some of that.

29:31.030 --> 29:33.075
One night, during a...

29:33.119 --> 29:35.904
a particularly tough case,

29:35.948 --> 29:38.646
uh, I told him my story.

29:38.689 --> 29:40.822
My whole story.

29:40.866 --> 29:43.651
My childhood was complicated.

29:45.218 --> 29:47.002
Gil understood
and after that,

29:47.046 --> 29:49.135
he was just there.

29:49.178 --> 29:50.701
The A.G.,

29:50.745 --> 29:52.921
the D.A., Judge Shapiro.

29:52.965 --> 29:55.837
That civil attorney
they assigned, Anson Wix.

29:55.881 --> 29:57.796
Mr. Hodges' lawyer, me,

29:57.839 --> 30:00.146
Dr. Roby-- I could keep going.

30:00.189 --> 30:02.844
With what?The list of people

30:02.888 --> 30:04.977
playing tug-of-war
over this mess.

30:05.020 --> 30:06.892
None of whom you want to test.

30:06.935 --> 30:08.981
SIDLE:
Most people are motivated
by impulses.

30:09.024 --> 30:11.244
Desire, anger, fear.

30:11.287 --> 30:13.855
There aren't any gears

30:13.899 --> 30:17.119
that shift for my husband
until he sees how they work.

30:17.163 --> 30:20.122
But you put him in a lab...

30:20.166 --> 30:23.125
you give him time to study...

30:23.169 --> 30:25.824
he finds his way.

30:30.959 --> 30:33.005
So, it looks like we're
all seeing this the same way.

30:33.048 --> 30:35.137
Just a real
unfortunate situation.

30:35.181 --> 30:36.835
It could've been worse.

30:36.878 --> 30:38.097
That's true.

30:38.140 --> 30:39.881
Officer Chung is not gonna
press charges.

30:39.925 --> 30:41.404
He gets it.

30:41.448 --> 30:43.145
But I just thought, you know,
this day and age,

30:43.189 --> 30:45.017
let's really make sure
we're all good here.
