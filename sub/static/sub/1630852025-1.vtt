00:09.751 --> 00:11.168
what may have happened here.

00:11.252 --> 00:15.180
We identified a lab that can
take a look at our water samples

00:15.339 --> 00:17.933
- from the perspective of gold.
- That's great.

00:18.092 --> 00:19.926
What the heck? That's lead.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.095
It's highly decorated.

00:22.180 --> 00:23.597
<i>It's like the crosses.</i>

00:23.690 --> 00:27.184
This island has got to be close

- Wow.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.277
(laughs) What do we got here?

00:37.370 --> 00:39.538
What the heck is that?

00:39.697 --> 00:41.206
I hate to say the "G" word,
but it could be.

00:41.365 --> 00:43.200
I have some results.

00:43.284 --> 00:45.368
You know, I'm-I'm obviously
sort of excited by this.

00:45.453 --> 00:47.629
- Oh, really?
- Really?

00:54.629 --> 00:56.221
- This year, we're going for the gold.
- Going for gold.

That's right.

believe, down in those holes,

that there is a very large
amount of silver.

03:27.782 --> 03:29.366
Is it a handful of silver

03:29.459 --> 03:31.210
or is it a Gerhart dump truck
load of silver?

03:31.294 --> 03:33.620
- It's a Gerhart dump truck.

And this is the first year

04:05.069 --> 04:07.663
we've had direct indications
of precious metals.

04:07.822 --> 04:08.989
And by that,
I mean we have silver--

04:09.082 --> 04:10.499
Silver dissolved in the water.

04:10.658 --> 04:14.160
<i>That screams of treasure.</i>

The goal, the focus,

04:33.106 --> 04:37.434
was always solve the mystery,
and that has never changed.

04:37.518 --> 04:39.352
Friendly faces
all around the table.

04:39.437 --> 04:42.114
How the family has grown.

<i>- NARRATOR: Due to important business</i>

<i>back in Traverse City, Michigan,</i>

04:58.789 --> 05:01.717
<i>Marty Lagina

<i>before they can

05:03.970 --> 05:05.628
<i>and join the team in person.</i>

05:05.713 --> 05:07.630
I think the best way
to begin this is

05:07.715 --> 05:09.716
to turn it over to Ian.

05:09.800 --> 05:11.885
Sure. The bottom line is,
no matter how you cut it,

05:11.978 --> 05:14.062
there's silver there.

05:14.221 --> 05:16.806
It's in wells
in the Money Pit area.

05:16.899 --> 05:18.475
And it's not a little silver.

05:18.559 --> 05:20.986
To create an anomaly
in groundwater, it's...

05:21.070 --> 05:22.645
it's a fair bit of silver.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.564
A dump truck load. Don't forget.

05:24.657 --> 05:26.325
- Uh...
- (laughter)

05:26.484 --> 05:28.401
BILLY: I remember the
dump truck part, Marty.

05:28.486 --> 05:29.828
I-- That's my recollection,
too, right?

05:29.912 --> 05:31.747
(laughter)

05:31.831 --> 05:34.240
DOUG:
That's exciting because

05:34.325 --> 05:37.827
the highest concentration was
just a few feet north of C-1.

05:37.920 --> 05:40.255
Charles picked C-1
a few years ago,

05:40.340 --> 05:41.748
and the shiny gold thing
was found.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.333
- Right?
- Yep.

Those are gold-colored.

06:15.792 --> 06:16.875
CHARLES: Yeah, and there's
another piece of it there, too.

Yeah, another piece.

06:35.719 --> 06:37.979
Oh, what's this?
Is this another one?

06:38.139 --> 06:39.139

06:39.223 --> 06:41.400
<i>NARRATOR:
Last year,</i>

06:41.559 --> 06:43.393
<i>the team obtained
additional video evidence</i>

06:43.477 --> 06:46.071
<i>of three more

<i>This evidence, combined with the
recent water testing results,</i>

06:56.991 --> 06:59.659
<i>the fabled
Money Pit treasure vault.</i>

06:59.752 --> 07:02.421
The question was: Where do we go

07:02.505 --> 07:05.757
with-with those results so that
we can focus our efforts?

07:05.916 --> 07:10.503
And so, we identified a lab
that can take a look

07:10.596 --> 07:14.174
not only at our water samples
from the perspective of silver,

07:14.267 --> 07:17.177
uh, but they can take a look
at our water samples from

07:17.270 --> 07:18.437
the perspective of gold.

07:19.355 --> 07:21.598
- All right!
- There you go.

07:21.682 --> 07:25.351
I thought gold wasn't
detectable, though, in water.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.113
- Apparently, it is.
- Okay.

07:28.272 --> 07:29.522
IAN:
And, so, this is something new.

07:29.615 --> 07:31.616
It's a lab in Queens, Ontario,

07:31.775 --> 07:34.202
and they specialize in
looking at groundwater

07:34.287 --> 07:36.037
in exploration for gold mines.

07:36.122 --> 07:37.205
Great.

07:37.364 --> 07:38.615
And so, I'm pretty excited.

07:38.708 --> 07:41.877
Rick, I want
to look for this gold

07:41.961 --> 07:43.786
- as soon as possible.
- (laughter)

07:43.880 --> 07:45.288
We've been looking for gold
for ten years now,

07:45.381 --> 07:47.799
and now we hear that maybe
we can detect it in the water.

07:47.884 --> 07:49.042
Let's see.

07:49.126 --> 07:50.218
Yeah, I think
everybody's on board that.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.304
Yeah.

07:52.463 --> 07:54.130
So, we'll get going on that
as soon as possible.

07:54.223 --> 07:55.882
And we're just gonna need
everybody's help

chasing the gold and silver.

08:29.166 --> 08:32.335
It's about chasing
where the gold and silver is.

08:32.428 --> 08:34.596
And the only way,
I think, to do that

08:34.680 --> 08:38.517

this silver in the water and
eager to see if there's gold,

round back to the swamp.

you know, we'd find this

09:41.071 --> 09:42.914

- Yeah. This is crazy.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.575
God, look at that.

It's possible.

09:48.829 --> 09:51.089
<i>NARRATOR:
Last year, the team uncovered</i>

09:51.248 --> 09:54.426
<i>a massive stone road,
or possible ship's wharf,</i>

09:54.585 --> 09:56.511
<i>in the southeastern corner
of the swamp.</i>

09:56.670 --> 09:58.013
This is really cool.

09:58.097 --> 09:59.097
It's impressive.

09:59.256 --> 10:01.349
This is mondo cool.

10:01.508 --> 10:05.845
<i>NARRATOR: Further investigation
revealed a separate cobblestone pathway,</i>

10:05.929 --> 10:10.016
<i>extending up the swamp's eastern
border and continuing on</i>

10:10.100 --> 10:13.278
<i>to an as yet undetermined
destination on the island.</i>

10:14.614 --> 10:16.856
<i>It was along this stone path</i>

10:16.940 --> 10:20.952
<i>that the team also found pieces
of 15th-century keg barrels,</i>

10:21.111 --> 10:22.278
<i>iron ring bolts--</i>

10:22.371 --> 10:25.531
<i>Possibly utilized as
part of a pulley system--</i>

10:25.625 --> 10:28.793
<i>And a trade weight,
an ancient tool typically used</i>

10:28.878 --> 10:31.880
<i>for the measurement
of gold and silver coins.</i>

10:32.039 --> 10:36.709
<i>But who built these features,
when, and for what purpose,</i>

10:36.802 --> 10:40.639
<i>remain burning questions
for Rick, Marty and the team.</i>

10:40.798 --> 10:43.808
The sole purpose
of everything associated

10:43.967 --> 10:45.885
with the stone path is
to find out where it goes.

10:45.978 --> 10:47.479
<i>It may go to the Money Pit.</i>

10:47.563 --> 10:50.056
<i>If you're offloading
something from a ship,</i>

10:50.140 --> 10:51.974
<i>you're gonna need
a stone path or a road</i>

10:52.059 --> 10:54.069
<i>to carry something inland.</i>

10:54.228 --> 10:56.738
<i>So, we need to follow that path.</i>

10:57.898 --> 11:00.158
I'm interested in going back
to the stone path.

11:00.242 --> 11:02.243
- Mm-hmm.
- I think, uh,

11:02.403 --> 11:04.746
Miriam has got
the trowel she loaned me.

11:04.830 --> 11:08.166
Yes. We'll give you a trowel,
don't worry.

11:08.250 --> 11:09.909
- Okey doke.
- (laughs)

11:10.002 --> 11:12.337
RICK:
So, that leads us to

11:12.421 --> 11:15.164
something that is-- will be
very impactful this year.

11:15.249 --> 11:16.666
- So, Laird...
- Yeah.

11:16.750 --> 11:18.418
Can you give us
some background about

11:18.502 --> 11:19.585
CCH's renewed interest

11:19.670 --> 11:21.596
and what the permitting
process will be?

11:21.681 --> 11:22.672
Yeah.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.766
You know,
where we currently sit.

11:24.850 --> 11:27.093
Yeah, so this year,
um, obviously we have

11:27.186 --> 11:28.853
a lot of stricter regulations.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.180
The Department of Community,
Culture and Heritage,

11:31.265 --> 11:33.441
who oversees archaeology
in Nova Scotia,

11:33.526 --> 11:36.027
they've suddenly sat up
and, uh, and taken notice.

11:36.186 --> 11:38.938
They want more control
over any search for

11:39.031 --> 11:40.949
past human activities.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.119
RICK: So, with any
archaeological exploration,

11:44.203 --> 11:46.446
we're not gonna be able
to operate

11:46.530 --> 11:47.956
the way we did
in previous years.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.457
Yeah.

11:49.616 --> 11:51.960
<i>NARRATOR:
In 2010,</i>

11:52.119 --> 11:53.953
<i>the Laginas and their partners</i>

11:54.046 --> 11:57.373
<i>obtained permission under
the Oak Island Treasure Act</i>

11:57.466 --> 12:00.051
<i>to investigate
all areas of the island,</i>

12:00.210 --> 12:04.130
<i>excluding designated locations
of cultural importance</i>

12:04.214 --> 12:07.976
<i>such as the Samuel Ball
foundation on Lot 25</i>

12:08.060 --> 12:12.313
<i>and the Daniel McGinnis
foundation on Lot 21.</i>

12:12.473 --> 12:16.401
<i>However, in the spring of 2021,</i>

12:16.560 --> 12:18.570
<i>they were informed by
the provincial department</i>

12:18.654 --> 12:20.980
<i>of Community, Culture
and Heritage</i>

12:21.073 --> 12:24.909
<i>that regulatory oversight,
especially activities involving</i>

12:24.994 --> 12:28.821
<i>archaeological investigations
across the island, had changed.</i>

12:28.914 --> 12:32.584
In previous years, the island
was divided into two parts:

12:32.743 --> 12:34.911
the western drumlin,
which we needed

12:35.004 --> 12:36.671
regular archeological
permits for,

12:36.830 --> 12:39.332
and then
the eastern drumlin, where,

12:39.416 --> 12:41.918
the vast majority of which,
we needed no permits at all.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.429
The Department of
Community, Culture and Heritage

12:44.513 --> 12:48.090
decided to rescind all of that,
except for that small area

12:48.184 --> 12:51.603
around the Money Pit,
and require permits for

12:51.687 --> 12:56.691
any work done, and to monitor
the excavation work.

12:56.776 --> 13:01.279
So, they want more formal tests
and excavated by hand

13:01.363 --> 13:03.773
and screen everything, uh,

13:03.857 --> 13:06.201
just like we would on a,
on a normal archaeological site.

13:06.285 --> 13:07.944
Okay.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.362
<i>MARTY:
When we first started</i>

13:09.455 --> 13:11.447
<i>on this quest of Oak Island,</i>

13:11.532 --> 13:13.792
with the original treasure
trove license that we had,

13:13.876 --> 13:17.119
there was very little
extra permission we needed.

13:17.204 --> 13:21.457
<i>There has been a gradually
increasing level of scrutiny,</i>

13:21.542 --> 13:24.293
<i>oversight and regulation
since that time.</i>

13:24.378 --> 13:26.963
<i>And I think it's
because of our efforts.</i>

13:27.047 --> 13:31.300
<i>We've proven that this place
has some real historical value.</i>

13:32.553 --> 13:35.897
The unintended consequence
is we got more regulation.

13:35.981 --> 13:38.817
But it's kind of
a pat on the back, really.

13:40.060 --> 13:43.238
The powers that be have
basically blessed it now

13:43.322 --> 13:44.823
by saying,
"Hey, this is for real.

13:44.907 --> 13:45.990
This matters."

13:46.075 --> 13:48.076
Well, that's great.
We made them care.

13:48.235 --> 13:50.736
- We made them care, yeah.
- Yeah.

13:50.821 --> 13:51.996
RICK:
I don't think,

13:52.155 --> 13:54.499
at this point,
you see it as restrictive

13:54.658 --> 13:56.584
- or prohibitive.
- No.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.586
In fact, what they've said,
I believe, is,

13:58.671 --> 13:59.921
- "We'll work with you."
- Yes.

14:00.005 --> 14:01.422
So, all good news to me, mate.

14:01.582 --> 14:03.591
- Exactly.
- MARTY: Okay.

14:03.750 --> 14:06.085
It sounds like we're all
on the same team

14:06.169 --> 14:07.420
and we can do this properly.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.597
- Well said.
- Yeah.

14:09.756 --> 14:11.674
RICK:
So, let's get to work.

14:11.767 --> 14:13.935
- To the quest.
- Thanks, everybody.

14:14.094 --> 14:15.520
<i>- See you, guys.
- See you later, guys. - See ya.</i>

14:37.459 --> 14:39.118
So, we-we formed
a game plan with Rick,

14:39.211 --> 14:41.203
and the game plan is
to test a lot of water wells.

14:41.288 --> 14:43.539
- Right.
- I think we're gonna mix

14:43.624 --> 14:45.541
between 2017 and 2020 holes.

14:45.626 --> 14:46.792
SCOTT:
Yes, that's right.

14:46.877 --> 14:49.554
<i>NARRATOR:
Unlike last year's water test,</i>

14:49.713 --> 14:51.639
<i>which was limited
to three boreholes</i>

14:51.798 --> 14:53.299
<i>in the Money Pit area,</i>

14:53.383 --> 14:55.134
<i>this new test will involve</i>

14:55.218 --> 14:56.895
<i>sampling from nearly ten times</i>

14:56.979 --> 14:59.889
<i>as many drill sites
and past excavations,</i>

14:59.973 --> 15:02.817
<i>all of which
yielded promising clues,</i>

15:02.902 --> 15:06.812
<i>pre-18th century artifacts
and man-made structures.</i>

15:06.897 --> 15:10.575
<i>It is the team's hope
that by identifying where</i>

15:10.659 --> 15:14.662
<i>the highest concentration
of silver and possibly gold is,</i>

15:14.747 --> 15:17.323

the precise location</i>

15:17.407 --> 15:19.417
<i>of the Money Pit treasure vault.</i>

15:19.501 --> 15:22.411
So, today we're gonna
start with E-8.

15:22.496 --> 15:24.505
- It's top on our list.
- Yep. Well, we got lots to do,

15:24.590 --> 15:25.498
- so let's get at it.
- Yeah.

15:25.582 --> 15:26.666
- We have a game plan.
- Great.

15:26.750 --> 15:28.593
I think it's astounding

15:28.677 --> 15:31.262
that you can test for gold
in the water, minute traces.

15:31.421 --> 15:33.506
<i>You have to remember,
it's parts per billion</i>

15:33.590 --> 15:35.099
<i>is what they're measuring,</i>

15:35.258 --> 15:37.843
<i>but hopefully
there is some evidence</i>

15:37.937 --> 15:39.929
<i>that there's gold
down in the Money Pit.</i>

15:40.013 --> 15:42.932
The depth of this one
might be, uh,

15:43.016 --> 15:44.600
a better chance
for getting some silver.

15:44.693 --> 15:47.028
- Right?
- Okay, let's hope.

15:47.112 --> 15:50.022
<i>NARRATOR: In order to
collect the water samples,</i>

15:50.115 --> 15:53.943
<i>Dr. Spooner is using
a single-valve sampling bailer.</i>

15:54.027 --> 15:58.122
<i>As the device descends down,
the water within the borehole</i>

15:58.207 --> 16:01.960
<i>will force a ball valve
to open, filling the bailer.</i>

16:02.044 --> 16:04.203
<i>Once it reaches
the desired depth,</i>

16:04.296 --> 16:07.206
<i>a ball joint at
the device's base will close,</i>

16:07.299 --> 16:10.292
<i>trapping and securing
the water sample inside</i>

16:10.377 --> 16:14.305
<i>to prevent contamination as it
is brought back to the surface.</i>

16:17.968 --> 16:19.477

It's a little discolored.

16:22.055 --> 16:23.806

- Oh, you're serious?

16:26.143 --> 16:27.318
Ugh.

16:28.904 --> 16:31.063
Quite mineral-rich but fresh.

16:31.148 --> 16:33.399
A fair bit of iron.

16:33.483 --> 16:34.742
Or calcium.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.153
There's nothing that would
ever hurt you down there.

<i>imposed by

17:02.596 --> 17:05.023
<i>has agreed to oversee

<i>of the area near the stone road,

There's the man
of the hour, Laird.

17:26.953 --> 17:28.370
If you want to give him
the lowdown.

17:28.455 --> 17:29.714
LAIRD:
Well, we're looking at

17:29.873 --> 17:32.884
excavating this whole...
this whole section in here.

17:33.043 --> 17:35.461
So, we're just going over,
uh, logistics.

17:35.545 --> 17:38.130
The hope is to find
some connective tissue

17:38.223 --> 17:39.474
to the stone road

17:39.633 --> 17:42.810
and further the understanding
of it, specifically.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.804
Hopefully to date the structure.

17:44.888 --> 17:46.555
Well, the beauty of the swamp
is it preserves the wood.

17:46.648 --> 17:47.890
Right?
So, that's the importance.

17:47.974 --> 17:50.151
Well, hopefully we'll find out
something today.

17:50.235 --> 17:53.312
<i>We still don't know a whole lot
about the stone road.</i>

17:53.405 --> 17:56.074
<i>So, the hope is,
as we peel back the layers</i>

17:56.158 --> 17:58.993
<i>in the southeast corner,
we'll find artifacts.</i>

17:59.152 --> 18:01.329
We'll figure out
some clues as to

18:01.413 --> 18:02.914
the who, what, when,
where, why and how of it.

18:04.658 --> 18:06.325
How deep are we gonna go?

18:06.409 --> 18:07.585
As deep as it takes.

18:07.669 --> 18:09.504
Good.
That's what I like to hear.

18:10.672 --> 18:13.666
<i>NARRATOR: At present,
Rick, Marty and Craig</i>

<i>may only conduct excavations
without Laird Niven's oversight</i>

<i>in the so-called green zone,
which encompasses</i>

18:20.516 --> 18:24.769
<i>the Money Pit area on Lots 18,
19 and a portion of 20.</i>

18:27.764 --> 18:30.024
<i>It is because of
the destructive digs</i>

18:30.109 --> 18:32.184
<i>that have taken place there
over the last century</i>

18:32.277 --> 18:34.695
<i>that the provincial government
has exempted it</i>

18:34.855 --> 18:36.072
<i>from their jurisdiction.</i>

<i>The rest of the team's

18:42.621 --> 18:46.040
<i>the new strict Community,
Culture and Heritage guidelines.</i>

18:46.125 --> 18:49.627
<i>However, in light of
the significant discoveries</i>

18:49.711 --> 18:52.371
<i>made near the stone road
last year,</i>

18:52.455 --> 18:54.790
<i>that also included
wooden survey stakes</i>

<i>and a possible
stone mason's tool,</i>

29:03.491 --> 29:07.068
<i>NARRATOR: Last year, Terry,
who is an environmental scientist</i>

29:07.153 --> 29:09.154
<i>and also the current president</i>

29:09.238 --> 29:11.823
<i>of the New England Antiquities
Research Association,</i>

29:11.908 --> 29:15.002
<i>made a stunning assessment
of the massive stone road</i>

29:15.161 --> 29:16.328
<i>that the team discovered</i>

29:16.412 --> 29:18.672
<i>in the southeastern corner
of the swamp.</i>

29:18.757 --> 29:21.341
This is 16th century and before.

29:21.426 --> 29:23.418
That's remarkable.

29:23.503 --> 29:25.763
<i>NARRATOR: In light of
the recent discoveries</i>

29:25.847 --> 29:28.340
<i>made near the stone road
in the swamp,</i>

29:28.424 --> 29:30.851
<i>Rick has invited Terry
to present new research</i>

29:31.010 --> 29:34.521
<i>that he's prepared about the
possible origins of the feature.</i>

29:34.606 --> 29:38.442
You don't find stone roads
underneath swamps, you know,

29:38.601 --> 29:40.101
below the surface of a swamp,
but we did.

29:40.195 --> 29:42.613
<i>And we're finding odd things</i>

29:42.772 --> 29:44.689
<i>in the southeast corner
of the swamp.</i>

29:44.774 --> 29:46.450
<i>Can't wait to see
what else is there.</i>

29:46.534 --> 29:48.360
So, Terry,
I turn it over to you.

29:48.453 --> 29:49.611
All right.

29:49.695 --> 29:52.531
So, when we saw that stone road

29:52.624 --> 29:55.951
uncovered in the swamp
last year, it just blew me away.

29:56.035 --> 29:57.294
Like, I was
pretty much speechless.

29:57.453 --> 30:00.539
I've never seen anything
of that magnitude in Nova Scotia

30:00.632 --> 30:02.123
built that way.

30:02.208 --> 30:04.551
So, afterwards, I started doing

30:04.636 --> 30:07.971
a little bit of research into
the historical records.

30:08.130 --> 30:11.550
I know that you're following
the stone path

30:11.634 --> 30:13.718
up towards the north,
and then towards the east.

30:13.812 --> 30:17.648
So, what I was looking for
in my investigation

30:17.732 --> 30:19.650
is to see if there was
some imagery

30:19.809 --> 30:23.153
of the terrain
that surrounds the beach.

30:24.239 --> 30:26.648
Because the beach
as it exists now

30:26.732 --> 30:28.826
was probably different
many, many years ago.

30:31.237 --> 30:35.156
I found aerial imagery
that had the most detail.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.751
And then the next thing I did

30:37.836 --> 30:41.079
is outline areas
on the aerial imagery.

30:41.163 --> 30:45.584
I started looking at
the actual underwater features,

30:45.677 --> 30:48.837
and the purple lines are

30:48.930 --> 30:51.181
linear features
on the sea floor.

30:51.340 --> 30:55.519
The next thing I did
is look for boulders

30:55.603 --> 30:58.021
on the sea floor, as well.

30:58.180 --> 31:01.525
And so the golden dots
are the boulders.

31:01.609 --> 31:03.602
The boulders
seem to be clustered

31:03.695 --> 31:06.938
in these lines,

31:07.023 --> 31:09.274
but they're not totally random.

31:09.358 --> 31:10.442
They do have a pattern.

31:10.535 --> 31:13.370
So, that right away
is pretty suggestive.

31:14.447 --> 31:17.875
So, I brought in a aerial photo

31:18.034 --> 31:21.962
of the actual excavation
that was done in 2020.

31:22.046 --> 31:29.219
And it is kind of amazing how
the stone road seems to line up

31:29.378 --> 31:33.048
with the boulders
and the linear features

31:33.132 --> 31:35.559
that were evident
in the aerial imagery.

31:35.643 --> 31:36.894
RICK:
Wow.

31:38.304 --> 31:42.223
Just purely observationally,
that-that alignment is strange.

31:42.317 --> 31:43.725
- SCOTT: Yeah.
- CHARLES: Yeah.

31:43.809 --> 31:46.645
TERRY: The linear features
that are there suggest that

31:46.729 --> 31:49.573
there may be some remnants
of dock construction materials

31:49.732 --> 31:52.159
that would give you
some indication that

31:52.243 --> 31:55.162
it did extend, let's say,
out into a-a stone dock perhaps,

31:55.246 --> 31:56.413
in-into the water.

31:58.240 --> 31:59.750
<i>NARRATOR:
A stone dock?</i>

32:00.993 --> 32:02.494
<i>Although Laird Niven,</i>

32:02.578 --> 32:05.923
<i>geoscientist Dr. Ian Spooner
and the team</i>

32:06.007 --> 32:08.667
<i>have speculated that the massive
stone road may have been</i>

32:08.760 --> 32:12.087
<i>the remains of
a shipping wharf centuries ago,</i>

32:12.171 --> 32:16.266
<i>is it possible that Terry Deveau
has found photographic evidence</i>

32:16.351 --> 32:18.852
<i>that could help verify it
and identify</i>

32:18.937 --> 32:20.771
<i>more of the ancient feature</i>

32:20.930 --> 32:24.182
<i>and clues that could help
determine its origin?</i>

32:24.266 --> 32:27.277
Is it your suggestion,
then, that a-a ship

32:27.362 --> 32:29.947
comes up to that dock,

32:30.031 --> 32:32.783
offload, and then
it's taken ashore?

32:32.942 --> 32:34.868
- Is that what you're suggesting?
- TERRY: Yeah.

32:34.953 --> 32:38.446
If there had been
a fairly narrow dock

32:38.531 --> 32:42.292
and road attached to it,
coming in this direction,

32:42.377 --> 32:44.786
you would need to have
kind of a staging area.

32:44.870 --> 32:46.129
Yep.

32:46.288 --> 32:48.215
RICK:
Is there a ballpark date, era

32:48.299 --> 32:50.884
when you think
this was constructed?

32:50.969 --> 32:55.630
This is a type of road that was
built in Europe in the 1500s.

32:55.715 --> 32:57.307
CHARLES:
Wow.

32:58.551 --> 33:00.468
If you look for the way

33:00.553 --> 33:05.306
roads were generally made
by people in Nova Scotia,

33:05.391 --> 33:07.651
what comes to my mind
is the Portuguese.

33:09.153 --> 33:13.907
The Portuguese were active
in Nova Scotia from 1522

33:13.992 --> 33:17.786
up till no later than, uh, 1583.

33:19.155 --> 33:20.163
Hmm.

33:21.574 --> 33:23.917
<i>NARRATOR:
In 2015,</i>

33:24.076 --> 33:27.587
<i>Terry alerted Rick, Marty,
Craig and Dave Blankenship</i>

33:27.747 --> 33:31.842
<i>to a mysterious carving some 145
miles southwest of Oak Island</i>

33:32.001 --> 33:34.669
<i>in the town of
Overton, Nova Scotia.</i>

33:34.762 --> 33:36.596
TERRY:
For my mind, this is

33:36.756 --> 33:39.933
diagnostic of Portuguese.

33:41.761 --> 33:45.513
<i>NARRATOR: Terry's assessment
was that the cross on the Overton Stone</i>

33:45.598 --> 33:48.767
<i>was made 500 years ago or more,</i>

33:48.860 --> 33:52.863
<i>just like the stone wharf
in the Oak Island swamp.</i>

33:52.947 --> 33:56.524
If Terry is right and this is
a Portuguese structure,

33:56.609 --> 33:57.776
that's impactful.

33:57.860 --> 34:00.445
<i>What he is suggesting that,
"Hey, guys,</i>

34:00.538 --> 34:02.956
<i>"it's not just the stone road
you're looking at.</i>

34:03.041 --> 34:04.458
<i>You're looking at a wharf."</i>

34:04.542 --> 34:06.284
<i>I think it all makes sense.</i>

34:06.368 --> 34:08.545
The problem is: Is it real?

34:08.629 --> 34:13.124
You have to find hard physical
evidence to support the theory.

34:13.209 --> 34:16.970
It's very tantalizing
that there may be some

34:17.055 --> 34:21.308
well-preserved evidence
within easy reach of the shore

34:21.467 --> 34:25.979
that could really reveal when
these constructions were made.

34:26.064 --> 34:28.306
- Yep.
- RICK: I do believe you have something else

34:28.390 --> 34:29.974
you'd like to show us, correct?

34:30.059 --> 34:31.976
Yeah. And so, with that in mind,

34:32.061 --> 34:34.154
I did come across
some imagery from

34:34.238 --> 34:36.815
the 1930s here in the Money Pit.

34:36.899 --> 34:39.910
What I found interesting was

34:39.994 --> 34:45.907
an apparent stone path
right over here,

34:45.991 --> 34:50.670
which doesn't seem to have
any explanation or purpose

34:50.755 --> 34:53.256
for any of the known
searcher activity.

34:56.177 --> 34:58.011
It appears that
it may be the remains

34:58.170 --> 35:00.430
of an ancient stone path,

35:00.515 --> 35:03.600
and it would align
with the path in this direction.

35:05.427 --> 35:07.437
<i>NARRATOR:
A stone pathway?</i>

35:07.522 --> 35:11.349
<i>Extending from the massive stone
ship's wharf in the swamp?</i>

35:11.442 --> 35:14.102
<i>Could Terry Deveau
have discovered a photograph</i>

35:14.186 --> 35:16.521
<i>of the very pathway
that the team found evidence of</i>

35:16.605 --> 35:21.609
<i>last year, which included
iron ring bolts and ox shoes,</i>

35:21.694 --> 35:23.528
<i>believed to have been used
in an operation</i>

35:23.612 --> 35:25.697
<i>to transport heavy cargo?</i>

35:25.781 --> 35:28.458
STEVE G.: Based on just the
finds that we've made on the island,

35:28.543 --> 35:30.627
that was, at one point,
a very heavily used path.

35:30.786 --> 35:32.954
- Interesting.
- And if the artifacts are there,

35:33.038 --> 35:34.714
wouldn't the path be there?

35:34.874 --> 35:36.133
- You'd think so.
- Right.

35:36.217 --> 35:38.802
Well, what you've done has

35:38.886 --> 35:41.304
amped up the interest
in-in that area,

35:41.389 --> 35:44.299
and I think we can follow up
on several fronts.

35:44.392 --> 35:45.976
And we really appreciate
your input.

35:46.135 --> 35:48.052
- Thank you very much.
- It's our pleasure.

35:48.137 --> 35:50.730
<i>I think we have more work to do.</i>

35:50.890 --> 35:51.648
<i>TERRY:
All right.</i>

35:57.897 --> 36:00.231
<i>NARRATOR: It is the
start of another exciting day</i>

36:00.324 --> 36:04.327
<i>on Oak Island,
as Rick and members of the team</i>

36:04.412 --> 36:06.246
<i>resume excavating
the stone wharf</i>

36:06.330 --> 36:08.081
<i>in the southeast corner

the Money Pit area...</i>

36:13.913 --> 36:15.163
<i>GARY:
All right.</i>

36:15.256 --> 36:17.591
<i>- Back to Lot 13.
- PETER: Yeah.</i>

36:17.675 --> 36:19.509
<i>NARRATOR: metal detection
expert Gary Drayton,</i>

36:19.594 --> 36:21.595
<i>along with
Rick and Marty's nephew,</i>

36:21.679 --> 36:24.598
<i>Peter Fornetti,
arrive at Lot 13.</i>

36:24.682 --> 36:27.934
<i>In light of Terry Deveau's
new evidence</i>

36:28.019 --> 36:30.678
<i>of a possible pathway
leading from the stone wharf</i>

36:30.763 --> 36:32.513
<i>in the swamp to the Money Pit,</i>

36:32.598 --> 36:34.682
<i>Gary is eager to search the area</i>

36:34.767 --> 36:37.194
<i>for any important
or valuable clues.</i>

36:39.605 --> 36:42.282
All right, mate.
Finally, back to the uplands.

36:42.441 --> 36:46.444
I've been looking forward
to this because if we can find

36:46.537 --> 36:49.706
some more artifacts in
this area, we could potentially

36:49.865 --> 36:52.542
give the guys an area
to start digging.

36:52.701 --> 36:55.378
And, who knows,
maybe the stone pathway

36:55.463 --> 36:57.547
- goes up towards the Money Pit.
- Yeah.

36:57.632 --> 37:01.301
So if we can find something
that gets the archeologists here

37:01.385 --> 37:02.636
and really gets them
a defined area,

37:02.795 --> 37:05.055
that'd be perfect for us today.

37:05.139 --> 37:07.882
And we've got plenty of flags
that we put down

37:07.967 --> 37:11.061
in this area, and we got
permission to dig, mate.

37:11.220 --> 37:12.812
- Today is gonna be a good day.
- All right.

37:12.897 --> 37:14.564
Okay, mate, let's dig 'em up.

37:16.558 --> 37:19.143
<i>NARRATOR: Due to the new Communities,
Culture and Heritage protocols,</i>

37:19.237 --> 37:22.405
<i>Gary scanned the area
earlier this morning</i>

37:22.490 --> 37:24.482
<i>but was only allowed

Yep.

- (beeping)
- You got it out, Pete.

37:56.274 --> 37:57.515
Let's see what we got.

37:57.599 --> 37:59.943
(beeping)

38:00.102 --> 38:02.112
Ah.

38:02.271 --> 38:03.280
Nope.

38:03.364 --> 38:04.698
- PETER: Nothing.
- Piece of junk, yeah.

38:04.782 --> 38:06.700
Piece of aluminum cap.

(beeps)

38:23.459 --> 38:24.884
(beeping)

38:24.969 --> 38:26.428
Doesn't sound too bad.

(beeping)

38:38.983 --> 38:40.233
You got it out, mate.

it was there. I pushed it.

38:42.144 --> 38:44.228
High hopes.

38:44.313 --> 38:46.397
Fingers crossed, mate. Let's go.

38:46.482 --> 38:48.325
(beeping)

38:48.409 --> 38:50.327
Come on, baby.

38:50.411 --> 38:52.403
Come to papa.

38:52.496 --> 38:54.456
Where are you?

38:55.574 --> 38:56.666
Here we go.

39:00.504 --> 39:02.505
What the heck is that?

39:03.665 --> 39:04.924
I mean, look at it.

39:05.084 --> 39:06.301
Look at that spiral.

39:07.595 --> 39:10.171
Yeah, this is definitely
not machine-made, mate.

39:10.255 --> 39:13.674
Uh, this is a unique little
object, whatever it is.

39:13.768 --> 39:16.436
At first,
I thought this was iron.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.438
- It's really heavy.
- Yeah.

39:18.522 --> 39:20.190
- That's lead.
- Oh.

39:20.274 --> 39:23.193
I've never seen
a piece of lead like this

39:23.352 --> 39:25.528
on Oak Island
that's spiraled like that.

39:26.947 --> 39:30.700
But the ultimate test is
if we get a rapid vibration

39:30.859 --> 39:32.610
- with the pinpointer...
- Then it's iron.

39:32.703 --> 39:33.536
Then it's iron.

39:34.863 --> 39:36.539
(beeping)

39:36.698 --> 39:38.032
Oh!

39:38.117 --> 39:40.034
It is. It's iron.

39:40.119 --> 39:41.619
(beeping)

39:41.712 --> 39:43.630
I believe, uh...

39:43.714 --> 39:45.298
Yeah, I'd have to say
that it's iron.

39:45.383 --> 39:46.624
I thought that was lead.

39:46.708 --> 39:49.302
Could it be multiple
different... materials?

39:49.387 --> 39:51.221
Yeah, it could be
a mix of alloys.

39:51.305 --> 39:53.390
- (beeping)
- (scoffs)

39:53.549 --> 39:55.225
I've got to go with iron.
I've got to go with iron.

39:55.384 --> 39:57.560
- Yeah. Yeah, trust your machines.
- Yeah. Yeah.

39:57.645 --> 40:01.139
<i>To be honest,
I was hoping it was lead</i>

40:01.232 --> 40:05.226
because you can get so much more
information off lead.

40:05.319 --> 40:08.071
And it's heavy.
Feel how heavy it is.

40:08.155 --> 40:12.316
<i>You can do the laser
ablation test on lead,</i>

40:12.410 --> 40:16.404
<i>so you can find out
where that lead came from.</i>

40:16.488 --> 40:18.573
You can actually date lead,

40:18.657 --> 40:22.043
and iron is much more
difficult to date.

40:23.495 --> 40:25.171
PETER: That's definitely
interesting, for certain.

40:25.330 --> 40:27.090
GARY:
Yeah. Exactly.

40:27.174 --> 40:29.500
And we recovered it
in a unique place

40:29.593 --> 40:33.096
'cause this is just up
from the stone pathway.

40:34.265 --> 40:36.182
Which makes it
even more interesting.

40:36.267 --> 40:39.510
And of course,
we'll put it on the XRF.

40:39.603 --> 40:41.762
Mm-hmm. Well, and once Kelly
gets that cleaned up,

40:41.847 --> 40:43.857
- we'll know for certain.
- Yeah, exactly.

40:43.941 --> 40:47.527
We got plenty of experts
that this is gonna

40:47.686 --> 40:48.862
go through their hands.

40:48.946 --> 40:50.613
- We'll get answers.
- Yeah.

40:50.772 --> 40:52.782
- So, let's bag it and tag it.
- Yep.

40:52.867 --> 40:54.784
<i>- GARY: Onto the next.

41:03.627 --> 41:05.712
Hi, everybody. How you doing?

41:05.871 --> 41:07.797
- Hello, Ian.
- Hey, Ian.

41:07.956 --> 41:10.383
<i>NARRATOR:

41:14.463 --> 41:17.548
<i>from his home in

41:17.633 --> 41:19.726
<i>Along with his colleague,

41:19.885 --> 41:22.729

<i>that were conducted
earlier this week</i>

41:25.065 --> 41:28.392
<i>in the boreholes
across the Money Pit area.</i>

41:28.486 --> 41:30.645
I have some results
that have been shared with me

41:30.729 --> 41:32.822
that I really felt I had to

41:32.907 --> 41:34.398
convey to you
as soon as possible.

41:34.483 --> 41:38.661
And I asked, uh, Dr. Peir Pufahl
to join us, as well.

41:38.820 --> 41:41.072
Dr. Pufahl is
at Queen's University,

41:41.156 --> 41:43.666
and he's the codirector

41:43.751 --> 41:45.835
of the Queen's Facility
for Isotope Research.

41:45.920 --> 41:48.671
I just want to say
that we're, uh, appreciative

41:48.756 --> 41:51.591
of the opportunity to help
all of you on Oak Island.

41:51.675 --> 41:54.085
Yeah, so are we,
and much appreciative.

41:55.504 --> 41:58.515
(chuckles): Uh, you know, I'm-I'm
obviously sort of excited by this.

41:58.599 --> 42:01.100
And-and so,
I-I hope you are, too.

42:01.185 --> 42:03.019
Yeah.

42:03.103 --> 42:04.854
So, we sent some samples
to Peir's lab.

42:04.939 --> 42:06.847
I think it was 12 samples.

42:06.941 --> 42:08.358
Is that correct, Peir?
I think...

42:08.517 --> 42:10.184
Yeah, I think that's
about right, 12 samples.

42:10.269 --> 42:12.529
IAN:
Yeah. He analyzed them,

42:12.613 --> 42:17.867
and a number of the samples
that I sent to him showed...

42:20.037 --> 42:21.538
gold.

42:22.864 --> 42:24.532
- Oh, really?
- Really?

42:24.616 --> 42:25.700
Yeah, gold.

42:25.784 --> 42:27.544
- Wow.
- (laughs)

42:34.051 --> 42:35.552
<i>NARRATOR: It is
a historic moment</i>

42:35.636 --> 42:37.128
<i>for brothers
Rick and Marty Lagina</i>

42:37.212 --> 42:38.471
<i>and their partner Craig Tester.</i>

42:38.630 --> 42:39.639
- Wow.
- That's great.

42:39.798 --> 42:41.808
This is the coolest thing.

42:41.892 --> 42:44.385
<i>NARRATOR: After conducting
extensive water tests,</i>

42:44.469 --> 42:47.638
<i>Dr. Ian Spooner
and Dr. Peir Pufahl</i>

42:47.731 --> 42:49.890
<i>have found evidence
that a number of boreholes</i>

42:49.975 --> 42:52.068
<i>in the Money Pit area
on Oak Island</i>

42:52.227 --> 42:55.479
<i>contain a substantial amount
of gold.</i>

42:55.564 --> 42:57.231
Okay, well, listen.

42:57.316 --> 42:59.158
I can't, I can't
contain myself anymore.

42:59.243 --> 43:02.078
But question number one:
I thought gold was

43:02.237 --> 43:04.655
so, uh, insoluble
that it didn't show up.

43:04.748 --> 43:08.826
- What's up with that?
- So, nothing is truly insoluble.

43:08.910 --> 43:11.671
If we take a general sample
of seawater, uh,

43:11.830 --> 43:15.082
we can analyze and detect every
element in the periodic table.

43:15.167 --> 43:17.176
Basically, it comes down to

43:17.261 --> 43:19.337
the kind of instrumentation
you have

43:19.421 --> 43:22.765
and the ability to detect
very, very minute quantities.

43:22.924 --> 43:25.092
And-and that's what
we're dealing with.

43:25.177 --> 43:30.106
And I've got three samples, uh,
that we're fairly confident have

43:30.190 --> 43:32.275
elevated trace
concentrations of gold.

43:32.359 --> 43:34.769
Fantastic.

43:34.853 --> 43:37.030
PEIR: We're talking
about parts per billion.

43:37.114 --> 43:40.867
You know, looking at the data,
these are the three samples

43:40.951 --> 43:43.194
that we can say confidently
at this stage

43:43.278 --> 43:46.456
have elevated concentrations
of gold within them.

43:47.625 --> 43:49.626
MARTY:
I-I know it's small numbers,

43:49.710 --> 43:52.629
but is it a magnitude bigger
than what you would expect?

43:52.788 --> 43:54.622
I mean, can you, can you
put brackets around

43:54.706 --> 43:56.540
what we're looking at here?

43:56.634 --> 44:00.211
For something that is
essentially, uh, insoluble,

44:00.295 --> 44:04.131
to have any concentration
at the levels that,

44:04.216 --> 44:07.310
you know, we're discussing,
it's-it's exciting.

44:07.469 --> 44:09.771
In normal waters,
it shouldn't be there.

44:11.231 --> 44:13.232
- That's great.
- Fantastic.

44:13.317 --> 44:16.977
What is really interesting
is the...

44:17.062 --> 44:18.821
not all the wells show gold,

44:18.980 --> 44:22.575
but the wells that did
show gold were the wells

44:22.734 --> 44:24.911
in the vicinity of C-1.

44:25.070 --> 44:27.738
And it mirrors some of the
silver results we're getting.

44:27.831 --> 44:31.909
And F-4 and E-8,

44:31.993 --> 44:33.503
those were the two this year

44:33.587 --> 44:35.079
that we had
the highest silver in.

44:36.248 --> 44:39.842
<i>CRAIG: F-4 is just north
of the Chappell Shaft.</i>

44:39.927 --> 44:42.586
<i>They tended to think north of
the Chappell Shaft would be</i>

44:42.680 --> 44:46.307
<i>the Money Pit, and
that's where that well's at.</i>

44:47.935 --> 44:50.261
Maybe it's leaching
from the so-called

44:50.345 --> 44:51.762
fabled Chappell Vault, too.

44:51.847 --> 44:53.097
Could be.

44:53.181 --> 44:55.850
<i>NARRATOR:
In 1931,</i>

44:55.934 --> 44:58.778
<i>44-year-old Melbourne Chappell</i>

44:58.862 --> 45:00.863
<i>joined his father William
and longtime treasure hunter</i>

45:00.948 --> 45:05.368
<i>Frederick Blair to begin
a new expedition on Oak Island.</i>

45:05.452 --> 45:08.788
<i>It was their intent
to locate the seven-foot-tall</i>

45:08.947 --> 45:12.041
<i>wooden vault that William
and Frederick had drilled into</i>

45:12.200 --> 45:16.462
<i>at a depth of 153 feet
back in 1897,</i>

45:16.621 --> 45:20.708
<i>an operation which recovered
not only a scrap of parchment</i>

45:20.792 --> 45:23.469
<i>bearing the letters "V-I"</i>

45:23.628 --> 45:26.464
<i>but also traces of gold.</i>

45:26.548 --> 45:30.143
<i>However, because the location
of the original Money Pit</i>

45:30.227 --> 45:34.063
<i>was unknown by this time,
they made an educated guess</i>

45:34.222 --> 45:36.733
<i>and constructed
a 12-foot-by-14-foot</i>

45:36.817 --> 45:41.145
<i>wood-cribbed shaft
down to a depth of 163 feet.</i>

45:42.322 --> 45:45.825
<i>Although they did recover
an early 18th-century axe</i>

45:45.909 --> 45:47.910
<i>and part of a ship's anchor,</i>

45:48.069 --> 45:49.904
<i>they unfortunately
never encountered</i>

45:49.988 --> 45:52.740
<i>any signs of
the so-called Chappell Vault.</i>

45:53.825 --> 45:56.586
<i>Is it possible that,
in borehole F-4,</i>

45:56.670 --> 45:59.663
<i>Rick, Marty and Craig
have found evidence of a target</i>

45:59.757 --> 46:02.759
<i>that the Chappells and Blair
just barely missed?</i>

46:02.843 --> 46:05.085
<i>RICK:
It's interesting. It's exciting.</i>

46:05.170 --> 46:08.181
And what it does say to me,

46:08.265 --> 46:11.267
because I've always
looked backwards

46:11.426 --> 46:15.095
<i>to the people
that have come before,</i>

46:15.189 --> 46:18.766
<i>it means something to me
on that level</i>

46:18.850 --> 46:21.694
<i>that they did not labor in vain,</i>

46:21.853 --> 46:23.771
<i>that here's the proof</i>

46:23.855 --> 46:27.575
<i>that indeed there is
temporal treasure on Oak Island.</i>

46:30.111 --> 46:33.539
To me, if the treasure
was there and taken away,

46:33.698 --> 46:37.293
you wouldn't have any signals
at all of silver or gold,

46:37.377 --> 46:40.046
so makes me think
it's still there.

46:40.130 --> 46:41.964
Yeah, that's really exciting.

46:42.049 --> 46:44.550
Uh, there's no way around it.
What a great way to start.

46:44.635 --> 46:46.126
- That's great.
- RICK: Very interesting.

46:46.211 --> 46:47.970
Very interesting.

46:48.972 --> 46:50.965
Hey, this is fantastic, okay?

46:51.049 --> 46:53.217
I was over the moon
about silver in the water.

46:53.301 --> 46:54.977
Now they're saying
there's gold in the water.

46:55.136 --> 46:58.314
<i>Also, an extremely
significant point.</i>

46:58.473 --> 47:01.225
<i>If all the wells
showed gold in them,</i>

47:01.309 --> 47:03.152
<i>I would think
it's a fluke of some sort.</i>

47:03.237 --> 47:07.073
So, I find it very substantive
that most of the holes that

47:07.157 --> 47:11.318
we've drilled and have access to
on Oak Island don't show gold.

47:11.411 --> 47:13.329
That means
that something special

47:13.413 --> 47:15.322
is happening in-in
the ones that do.

47:15.415 --> 47:17.241
So, what is the next step, guys?

47:17.334 --> 47:20.336
Well, as Ian mentioned,
this is preliminary data.

47:20.420 --> 47:24.090
It's truly hot off the press,
and the full, uh, suite of data

47:24.174 --> 47:26.175
we'll provide to you guys, uh,

47:26.260 --> 47:28.586
in a week or so, once we've had
a chance to basically

47:28.670 --> 47:29.929
go through the whole data set.

47:30.013 --> 47:32.014
Right.

47:32.099 --> 47:33.599
Well, you know,
the data's gonna be great

47:33.684 --> 47:34.925
for our-our drilling program.

47:35.010 --> 47:37.595
So, uh, we can definitely
incorporate this data.

47:37.679 --> 47:38.762
Absolutely.

47:38.847 --> 47:40.097
<i>The hope is that,</i>

47:40.181 --> 47:44.184
<i>if these test results are real,</i>

47:44.269 --> 47:48.022
<i>we can pull a core with
a large amount of gold.</i>

47:48.106 --> 47:49.699
Again, it's exciting stuff,

47:49.783 --> 47:52.451
but you got to put steel
down the hole.

47:52.611 --> 47:53.786
There's no way around it.

47:53.945 --> 47:55.371
There's-there's gold showing up

47:55.530 --> 47:57.615
in some of the waters
is really exciting.

47:57.708 --> 47:59.783
- (laughs)
- Okay.

47:59.868 --> 48:01.460

- Yeah.

A little more.

52:01.618 --> 52:06.372
Mix of pad gravel

Definitely disturbed.

52:08.208 --> 52:10.251
Anyway, let's move on.

52:11.619 --> 52:14.621
Now, gold obviously would be
the end-all, be-all.

52:14.706 --> 52:17.541
- Yeah.
- Let me hold something. Right?

52:17.625 --> 52:20.469
Something that says
the Money Pit story is real.

52:20.628 --> 52:21.879
Yeah.

Mm-hmm.

53:52.053 --> 53:55.731
So, would you say
it's European or local?

53:55.815 --> 53:57.808
No, it'd be European.

- Yeah, for sure.

54:01.154 --> 54:03.480

meant to go into something,

56:10.191 --> 56:12.701
and that stopped it
from going all the way through.

56:12.786 --> 56:14.203
But it was sail-related.

56:16.039 --> 56:18.207

<i>as the 7th century A.D.,</i>

56:28.543 --> 56:30.803

as fasteners</i>

56:30.962 --> 56:32.888
<i>in ancient shipbuilding</i>

<i>If so, what did it carry
to Oak Island?</i>

56:58.489 --> 57:02.418
<i>And could the answer be waiting
at the bottom of the Money Pit?</i>

57:02.502 --> 57:05.587
I find both of these
very interesting.

57:05.746 --> 57:06.746
Yeah.

57:06.831 --> 57:08.331
- That one in particular, I think.
- Yeah.

57:09.509 --> 57:12.085
RICK: Both of these should
go to someone who's familiar

15-, 16-, 1700s.

57:16.841 --> 57:18.258

KELLY:
Well, this one, of course,

58:28.004 --> 58:30.830
is-is really unusual.

58:30.924 --> 58:32.341
I've never seen
anything like it.

58:32.425 --> 58:35.085
When we first found it,
you know,

58:35.169 --> 58:37.513
I'm thinking it was lead
'cause it's so heavy.

58:37.672 --> 58:40.006
And then, when I put
my pinpointer on it,

58:40.099 --> 58:41.767
it was reacting
like it was iron.

58:41.851 --> 58:45.345
You had a good point
with the iron.

58:45.429 --> 58:48.932
We did, uh,
our XRF analysis on it.

58:49.025 --> 58:51.860
There's a certain percentage
of iron content in this.

58:52.019 --> 58:53.695
1.47%.

58:55.698 --> 58:57.866
Antimony: 6.68%.

58:57.951 --> 58:59.859
Lead was 90%.

58:59.944 --> 59:01.111
GARY:
Nice.

59:01.204 --> 59:03.196
- It's lead.
- Yeah.

KELLY:
Yeah, it's just, uh, something

59:05.542 --> 59:07.701
I've never come across before,
so I'd be interested

59:07.785 --> 59:09.962
- in learning more about that particular design.
- GARY: Yeah.

59:10.046 --> 59:11.296
RICK:
You know what I would like,

59:11.455 --> 59:13.465
if it's not inconvenient?

59:13.550 --> 59:18.295
When lead items come in,
run the XRF and keep track of

59:18.379 --> 59:20.722
- the trace elements.
- Sure.

59:20.881 --> 59:21.881
- You know where I'm going.
- GARY: Oh, yeah.

59:21.975 --> 59:24.467
- Drayton's cross.
- The cross, yeah.

59:24.552 --> 59:26.636

- Yeah.

59:26.729 --> 59:29.898
We now know it's from
southern Mediterranean.

59:29.983 --> 59:32.234
Well, if there are
a number of these

59:32.318 --> 59:34.820
and we could track them that
way through the trace elements,

59:34.904 --> 59:36.530

We can't do that
with the iron objects.

further down the discovery road.

<i>So, there's no reason
not to do it.</i>

1:00:10.765 --> 1:00:13.016

What the heck is it?

1:00:13.100 --> 1:00:15.360
Yeah, no idea. Um...

That is an unusual design.

1:00:32.629 --> 1:00:35.705
And it's highly decorated,
and it's nice and crude.

1:00:35.798 --> 1:00:38.884
Just like the cross is,
nicely, crudely made.

1:00:39.043 --> 1:00:41.127
What the heck was that?

1:00:41.212 --> 1:00:42.387
'Cause that's only
part of something.

1:00:42.472 --> 1:00:45.965
Um, also, when I was cleaning,

1:00:46.059 --> 1:00:48.551
there's a small hole in one end,

1:00:48.636 --> 1:00:52.481
so I'm not too sure if
it was on a spike or what.

1:00:52.565 --> 1:00:54.808
And I'm feeling this is
gonna be a nice surprise.

1:00:54.892 --> 1:00:56.309

it's got looks like

a square crude hole
that's broken there.

1:04:13.182 --> 1:04:16.852

- Can you imagine the size of it?

1:04:19.772 --> 1:04:22.181

We're at 139.

1:05:26.589 --> 1:05:29.174
Then we're down, the next one
would be around 150.

1:05:29.258 --> 1:05:30.425
Right.

1:05:30.584 --> 1:05:32.427
(machinery clanking)

1:05:39.018 --> 1:05:42.512
Hopefully with this program,
we get silver or gold.

1:05:42.605 --> 1:05:46.849

on placing a large can.

1:05:46.934 --> 1:05:50.353
<i>CRAIG: We're not only
drilling and looking for wood</i>

1:05:50.446 --> 1:05:52.855

1:05:56.777 --> 1:05:59.112
that tests high amount
of gold and silver,

1:05:59.205 --> 1:06:01.623

if there's a treasure there.

- Want me to cut it?
- Sure. Please do.

1:06:19.976 --> 1:06:24.137
Okay, so at 145-ish, right here,

1:06:24.221 --> 1:06:26.889
we seem to have
some disturbed material.

1:06:26.974 --> 1:06:29.559
There's-- it's fairly
well-bedded down below

1:06:29.652 --> 1:06:31.987
and it looks like up above, but
we're seeing some disturbance

1:06:32.071 --> 1:06:35.231
through here at about
145-foot level below grade.

1:06:35.324 --> 1:06:36.741
It's also black, you can tell...

1:06:36.826 --> 1:06:39.068
TERRY: Somewhat
blackened and disturbed.

1:06:39.161 --> 1:06:40.161
It's definitely out of place.

1:06:41.739 --> 1:06:43.823
Well, well, well.

1:06:43.916 --> 1:06:45.742
Now, we weren't
expecting that, Craig.

1:06:45.826 --> 1:06:46.793
Oh.

1:06:48.587 --> 1:06:51.006
TERRY:
That's a fairly substantial

1:06:51.165 --> 1:06:53.332
little chunk of wood,
but, you know, I don't see

1:06:53.426 --> 1:06:55.927
- any other-other beams in there.
- Yep.

1:06:56.012 --> 1:06:57.762
So, it's hard to say
what's going on here.

1:06:57.921 --> 1:07:00.673
Well, at 145, you're getting

1:07:00.758 --> 1:07:04.761
about to the top of, uh, where
the Chappell Vault was found.

1:07:05.938 --> 1:07:08.598
<i>NARRATOR: Could Craig's
notion that the team has</i>

1:07:08.691 --> 1:07:11.184
<i>possibly encountered
the legendary treasure vault,</i>

1:07:11.268 --> 1:07:14.687
<i>first reported in 1897, be true?</i>

1:07:14.780 --> 1:07:18.450
<i>If so, might they be
one more core sample away</i>

1:07:18.534 --> 1:07:20.860
<i>from the source
of the silver and gold</i>

1:07:20.944 --> 1:07:24.030
<i>recently identified by
underground water testing?</i>

1:07:25.207 --> 1:07:27.116
CRAIG: Is there any
chance it's an open tunnel

1:07:27.209 --> 1:07:28.701
and collapsed on itself?

1:07:28.786 --> 1:07:31.379
Oh, my goodness, there's an
absolute possibility of that.

1:07:31.538 --> 1:07:34.716
But if this kind of
rushed into a relative void,

1:07:34.875 --> 1:07:36.968
you know, all of that
soft material could bypass

1:07:37.053 --> 1:07:39.712
and ooze around
a lot of cribbing.

1:07:39.797 --> 1:07:42.891
I mean, it's a pretty
loose section.

1:07:43.050 --> 1:07:44.893
So, anyway,
it's interesting stuff.

1:07:44.977 --> 1:07:47.637
I definitely want
to get these...

1:07:47.730 --> 1:07:49.814
these pieces of wood C-14 dated.

1:07:49.899 --> 1:07:50.899

Okay, are you done with this?

1:07:52.476 --> 1:07:54.894
I am. For sure.

1:07:56.489 --> 1:08:00.658
<i>MARTY: If that wood dates to
before the Money Pit was discovered,</i>

1:08:00.818 --> 1:08:02.494
<i>that could get really exciting.</i>

1:08:02.578 --> 1:08:05.238

It's-it's really encouraging.

1:08:13.997 --> 1:08:17.175
I guess, do you want to open
this up to take a look?

1:08:19.419 --> 1:08:20.845
TERRY: We should find
some disturbed material here.

1:08:20.930 --> 1:08:22.338

If it fell in, yes.

1:08:22.431 --> 1:08:24.757
TERRY: Let's see if we can
see any evidence of same.

1:08:24.842 --> 1:08:27.102
(chuckles) She's definitely
loose; it's hard to say.

1:08:27.186 --> 1:08:31.356

uh, shavings or splinters.

1:08:32.775 --> 1:08:33.942

<i>and in the very same vicinity
that water testing</i>

<i>has identified the presence
of both silver and gold.</i>

1:08:46.280 --> 1:08:49.207
<i>However, could the lack

<i>or artifacts

1:08:55.372 --> 1:08:57.298
<i>- but only grazed it?</i>
- Okay.

1:08:57.383 --> 1:08:59.458
<i>RICK: The interesting
thing about finding this wood</i>

1:08:59.543 --> 1:09:03.796

<i>where the so-called

1:09:07.634 --> 1:09:09.218
<i>And so, of course,</i>

1:09:09.303 --> 1:09:11.971
your-your mind goes
to that possibility.

1:09:12.064 --> 1:09:15.316
And thus, to me, it rounds to

1:09:15.475 --> 1:09:20.155
let's stay focused on the grid,
because if it is

1:09:20.239 --> 1:09:23.316
associated with the vault,
then let's define the vault.

1:09:23.400 --> 1:09:26.411
We're here.
Okay, we just drilled this one.

1:09:26.570 --> 1:09:28.321
We got wood on the last one.

1:09:28.414 --> 1:09:29.822
You know,
I think it's a victory.

1:09:29.915 --> 1:09:32.500
I'm ready to move on
to the next hole.

1:09:32.585 --> 1:09:33.501
TERRY:
Yep.

1:09:33.660 --> 1:09:35.253

CARMEN:
Got some more stuff for me?

1:10:29.558 --> 1:10:30.808
- PETER: Yeah.
- DOUG: Yeah.

1:10:30.893 --> 1:10:32.718
Let's have a look.

1:10:32.803 --> 1:10:35.230
This was found
towards the Money Pit.

1:10:35.389 --> 1:10:36.731
Okay.

1:10:40.727 --> 1:10:42.478
Uh...

1:10:42.562 --> 1:10:45.314
this is a handmade iron band.

1:10:45.399 --> 1:10:48.150
You can see there's a--
Well, it's a hole here.

1:10:48.235 --> 1:10:51.412
- The width and the thickness of it...
- PETER: Mm-hmm.

1:10:51.497 --> 1:10:53.915
It's a band off of a wagon wheel

1:10:53.999 --> 1:10:55.917
- or a cart wheel.
- Oh.

1:10:56.001 --> 1:10:57.910
This goes around
the hub that holds

1:10:58.003 --> 1:10:59.087
the center
of the wheel together.

1:10:59.171 --> 1:11:01.005
The size of it indicates

1:11:01.090 --> 1:11:03.591
early-early time period
use of a cart.

1:11:03.750 --> 1:11:08.388
I'm gonna say 1650
to probably 1780, 1790.

1:11:09.923 --> 1:11:12.341
After that,
they got bigger, thicker.

1:11:12.426 --> 1:11:14.519
That is intriguing.

1:11:14.603 --> 1:11:17.021
<i>NARRATOR:
The hub of a wagon wheel?</i>

1:11:17.180 --> 1:11:20.358
<i>Dating back to as early as 1650?</i>

1:11:20.442 --> 1:11:22.527
<i>And found between
the possibly ancient</i>

1:11:22.611 --> 1:11:25.530
<i>stone wharf in the swamp

1:11:25.689 --> 1:11:29.525
<i>Is it possible that Gary Drayton

1:11:29.609 --> 1:11:32.445
<i>of cargo being hauled

1:11:32.529 --> 1:11:35.114
<i>as much as 150 years prior</i>

1:11:35.198 --> 1:11:38.459
<i>to the original
treasure shaft's discovery?</i>

1:11:38.544 --> 1:11:42.288
<i>If so, might it also support
Terry Deveau's theory</i>

1:11:42.372 --> 1:11:45.133
<i>about the approximate age
of the stone wharf</i>

1:11:45.292 --> 1:11:48.127
<i>and its potential
Portuguese origin?</i>

1:11:49.305 --> 1:11:50.972
DOUG: We've had this
idea that carts were used

1:11:51.131 --> 1:11:53.808
along this stone road
and pathway,

1:11:53.967 --> 1:11:55.885
and perhaps heading towards
the Money Pit.

1:11:55.969 --> 1:11:57.386
- PETER: Mm-hmm.
- But this would be the first

1:11:57.471 --> 1:11:58.646
tangible piece of evidence that

1:11:58.731 --> 1:12:01.474
this would go hand-in-hand
with ox shoes and...

1:12:01.558 --> 1:12:02.975
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- And carts.

1:12:03.068 --> 1:12:04.736
Where's the rest of the cart?

1:12:04.895 --> 1:12:06.729
That's a good question.

1:12:06.813 --> 1:12:07.739
You might be narrowing down
the time period

1:12:07.898 --> 1:12:09.398
and maybe the activity.

1:12:09.491 --> 1:12:10.575
PETER:
Okay.

1:12:10.659 --> 1:12:11.826
That's exactly...

1:12:11.985 --> 1:12:14.829
exactly what we're looking for:
evidence that

1:12:14.988 --> 1:12:17.415
<i>high-wheeled carts
are associated</i>

1:12:17.499 --> 1:12:19.992
<i>with the stone road
or the stone path.</i>

1:12:20.077 --> 1:12:22.086
<i>That's substantive information.</i>

1:12:22.171 --> 1:12:25.006
That's exactly the kind of
evidence we're looking for.

1:12:25.090 --> 1:12:28.092
That's the first artifact
of that type

1:12:28.251 --> 1:12:30.345
- associated with a cart that I'm aware of.
- PETER: Yeah.

1:12:30.429 --> 1:12:32.004
- I think the guys will be interested to hear that.
- Yeah.

1:12:32.089 --> 1:12:33.422
- DOUG: Yeah.
- Absolutely.

1:12:33.507 --> 1:12:34.590
- All right.
- Very good.

1:12:34.683 --> 1:12:36.175
- Thank you, Carmen.
- Oh, you're very welcome.

1:12:36.268 --> 1:12:38.260
- Glad I could help.
- Absolutely.

1:12:38.345 --> 1:12:40.188
- Thanks, Carmen.
- Come back again with some more.

1:12:40.347 --> 1:12:41.597
- Take care. - Will do.
- Happy digging.

1:12:41.681 --> 1:12:43.191
PETER:
Yeah, thanks.

<i>A borehole located less than
ten feet from the C-1 shaft.</i>

1:13:05.956 --> 1:13:07.882
So, we have multiple targets

- in this hole...
- Yeah, absolutely.

1:13:10.219 --> 1:13:12.303

<i>a possible tunnel
at a depth of some 90 feet</i>

1:13:34.076 --> 1:13:37.653
<i>that they found in this area
just one year ago.</i>

1:13:37.737 --> 1:13:41.157
One of the key things here
is we get the tunnel.

1:13:41.250 --> 1:13:43.584
We'll run in and we get
a water sample at that zone.

1:13:43.743 --> 1:13:45.420
If we can duplicate
that gold and silver

1:13:45.579 --> 1:13:48.247
- and then isolate it to which horizon.
- Yeah.

1:13:48.331 --> 1:13:50.416
- You can come on in, drop it off.
- What's the good word, Adam?

1:13:50.509 --> 1:13:53.002
- How's it going, Adam?
- ADAM: 85.

1:13:53.086 --> 1:13:55.596
85. Let's take a look, shall we?

1:13:58.425 --> 1:13:59.767
I would say
that's moving into, uh,

1:13:59.926 --> 1:14:01.594
it looks like the clay
to me, but...

1:14:01.678 --> 1:14:02.845
- STEVE G.: Is it just natural?
- It's still...

1:14:02.929 --> 1:14:04.272
Oh, it's still natural.

1:14:04.431 --> 1:14:06.357
It would still be good to
dig in, but it's a little bit

1:14:06.516 --> 1:14:07.942
looser than normal.

1:14:08.101 --> 1:14:10.111
That might mean
that it's close to, uh,

1:14:10.270 --> 1:14:12.780
an open water cavity
beneath "a tunnel."

1:14:13.949 --> 1:14:16.859
The next core is the tell
on this hole.

1:14:16.943 --> 1:14:18.194
- That's the hope.
- (knocks)

1:14:18.287 --> 1:14:19.528
Knock on wood.

1:14:19.613 --> 1:14:21.247

1:14:24.710 --> 1:14:26.285
CHARLES:
Here we go, here we go.

1:14:26.369 --> 1:14:28.296
Let's hope it's a good one.

1:14:28.455 --> 1:14:30.298
Which end do you want me to hit?
Right here?

1:14:30.457 --> 1:14:33.042
- Is this the bottom?
- That's the bottom, yep.

1:14:33.135 --> 1:14:35.294
What's the word, Mike?

1:14:35.378 --> 1:14:37.054
Uh, 90 feet.

1:14:37.139 --> 1:14:38.306
STEVE G.:
90 feet?

1:14:42.552 --> 1:14:43.478

Terry, we got wood.

1:14:43.562 --> 1:14:45.563

That's what we want to see.

1:14:45.647 --> 1:14:47.732

- Look at this.

- There's our wood, guys. That's great.
- Yep.

1:14:49.726 --> 1:14:50.976
TERRY:
Looks good to me.

1:14:51.069 --> 1:14:55.281
And that looks like
a fairly good section of beam.

1:14:56.492 --> 1:14:58.826
Really looks like
a cut surface for sure.

1:14:58.985 --> 1:15:01.913
I think, well,
that really bodes well for age.

1:15:02.072 --> 1:15:02.830
CHARLES:
Yeah, it does.

1:15:03.999 --> 1:15:05.333
TERRY: That's
probably a floor-to-ceiling

1:15:05.492 --> 1:15:07.752
- collapse of a tunnel right there.
- CHARLES: Yeah.

1:15:07.836 --> 1:15:10.755
TERRY: There's no question in my
mind that that was an open structure,

1:15:10.839 --> 1:15:11.964
once upon a time.

1:15:13.175 --> 1:15:15.927
<i>NARRATOR:

1:15:16.011 --> 1:15:19.430

1:15:23.268 --> 1:15:24.426

<i>NARRATOR:
And, if so,</i>

1:15:26.104 --> 1:15:29.357
<i>could it also be connected to
the evidence of silver and gold</i>

1:15:29.516 --> 1:15:32.768
<i>detected in
the so-called C-1 cluster?</i>

1:15:32.861 --> 1:15:35.780
<i>RICK: We're getting
multiple hits of wood</i>

1:15:35.939 --> 1:15:38.524
<i>at a consistent depth,</i>

1:15:38.608 --> 1:15:41.026
indicating a possible tunnel

1:15:41.111 --> 1:15:43.204
in an area that was
previously unknown.

1:15:44.864 --> 1:15:48.951
<i>So, given the significance
not only of the C-1 cluster</i>

1:15:49.035 --> 1:15:52.371
<i>but the silver and gold
water sampling results,</i>

1:15:52.455 --> 1:15:55.132
finding this tunnel depth at

1:15:55.217 --> 1:15:58.294
somewhere in the 80-to-90-foot
horizon is interesting.

1:15:58.378 --> 1:16:00.471
So, Craig, you want us to get
a water sample out of here

1:16:00.556 --> 1:16:01.964
- at this depth?
- Yes, yep.

1:16:02.048 --> 1:16:05.059
You know, anything that
came out of this tunnel zone,

1:16:05.143 --> 1:16:08.137
be great to test
if silver and gold was in it.

1:16:08.230 --> 1:16:10.231
- You know, it may come out of this horizon.
- Yeah.

1:16:10.390 --> 1:16:13.818
Testing will help us
define the zone of interest,

1:16:13.902 --> 1:16:16.395
- so maybe that's the tunnel we have to follow.
- CRAIG: Absolutely.

1:16:16.488 --> 1:16:17.730
Once we've associated it
with gold,

1:16:17.823 --> 1:16:19.073
we got to follow that tunnel.

1:16:19.232 --> 1:16:21.576
<i>- CHARLES: That's right.
- TERRY: There you go.</i>

1:16:24.830 --> 1:16:26.414
<i>NARRATOR:

<i>Dr. Pufahl is now prepared

1:17:06.279 --> 1:17:08.530
Really, the core
of this discussion,

1:17:08.615 --> 1:17:10.207
I think, is: What do we do next?

1:17:10.292 --> 1:17:11.367
I think we're all anticipating

1:17:11.451 --> 1:17:13.285
what these results
are gonna indicate.

1:17:13.370 --> 1:17:15.129
So, I'm gonna
turn it over to you, Ian.

1:17:16.289 --> 1:17:18.299
IAN:
So, what do you got to tell us?

1:17:18.458 --> 1:17:20.635
PEIR:
All right, here is essentially

1:17:20.719 --> 1:17:23.638
a location map
of those drill holes

1:17:23.722 --> 1:17:26.891
that were sampled,
uh, for their water.

1:17:26.975 --> 1:17:29.727
And so, really, what I'd like
you to do is to, number one,

1:17:29.811 --> 1:17:32.137
turn your attention
to these holes

1:17:32.222 --> 1:17:36.058
that are gold in color,
because these are the holes

1:17:36.142 --> 1:17:40.738
within which we found gold
in the water samples.

1:17:40.822 --> 1:17:42.740
All right? That would be C-1,

1:17:42.824 --> 1:17:45.660
F-4, E-8 and K-7.

1:17:45.744 --> 1:17:48.329
So, without further ado,
let's look at

1:17:48.413 --> 1:17:52.491
some of the concentrations
of gold

1:17:52.584 --> 1:17:55.160
that we're actually
focusing on here.

1:17:55.245 --> 1:17:57.663
Your mind jumps to:
Well, is there some sort of

1:17:57.747 --> 1:17:59.340
natural source to this gold?

1:17:59.424 --> 1:18:02.751
<i>We have to have eliminated
a natural source</i>

1:18:02.844 --> 1:18:05.429
for the gold to be meaningful
here on Oak Island.

1:18:05.514 --> 1:18:08.516
PEIR:
So, when we look at F-4,

1:18:08.600 --> 1:18:13.011
all right, we're talking about
0.044 parts per billion.

1:18:13.105 --> 1:18:16.932
Hole C-1:
0.017 parts per billion.

1:18:17.016 --> 1:18:20.528
And K-7:
0.012 parts per billion.

1:18:21.613 --> 1:18:24.198
To put this in context,
all right,

1:18:24.282 --> 1:18:28.953
seawater has an average
concentration of gold of about

1:18:29.112 --> 1:18:31.872
0.10 parts per billion.

1:18:32.874 --> 1:18:35.451
So, the take-home message
here is this,

1:18:35.535 --> 1:18:38.203
that, yes, gold is present
and it's elevated.

1:18:38.296 --> 1:18:40.798
It's either coming
from the till,

1:18:40.882 --> 1:18:41.882
it's coming from the bedrock,

1:18:42.041 --> 1:18:43.467
or there's something
buried down there.

1:18:43.552 --> 1:18:44.885
<i>MARTY:
Wow.</i>

1:18:49.299 --> 1:18:50.891
<i>NARRATOR: It is an incredible
moment for brothers</i>

1:18:50.976 --> 1:18:52.968
<i>Rick and Marty Lagina
and the Oak Island team.</i>

1:18:53.061 --> 1:18:57.055
<i>Geoscientist Dr. Peir Pufahl
has just confirmed</i>

1:18:57.140 --> 1:18:59.641
<i>his analysis
of water sampling tests</i>

1:18:59.735 --> 1:19:03.312
<i>conducted in numerous boreholes
across the Money Pit area.</i>

1:19:03.405 --> 1:19:07.241
<i>Something containing
large amounts of silver and gold</i>

1:19:07.325 --> 1:19:11.746
<i>lies deep underground in
the vicinity of the C-1 shaft.</i>

1:19:11.830 --> 1:19:15.991
What I do think is interesting,
when you look at where

1:19:16.084 --> 1:19:19.411
the gold-enriched wells are,
they're only, you know,

1:19:19.496 --> 1:19:23.174
25, uh, 50 feet away
from each other.

1:19:23.258 --> 1:19:27.586
And so, if I were a betting man,

1:19:27.679 --> 1:19:29.430
I bet we're in the right area.

1:19:30.673 --> 1:19:33.434
When you look at these data,

1:19:33.518 --> 1:19:36.178
I think we're-we're kind of
right close to that bull's-eye.

1:19:36.271 --> 1:19:37.229
MARTY:
Wow.

1:19:38.857 --> 1:19:40.775
MATT: Given that
F-4-- I mean, obviously

1:19:40.934 --> 1:19:43.861
it's the well of interest
and it seems to be

1:19:43.945 --> 1:19:45.446
the, uh, biggest outlier

1:19:45.530 --> 1:19:47.439
of all the wells
we've been looking at.

1:19:47.532 --> 1:19:50.359
'Cause it's the standout
here by far.

1:19:50.443 --> 1:19:52.528
Yeah, so when we look
at the chemistry of F-4,

1:19:52.612 --> 1:19:53.862
almost every other trace element

1:19:53.955 --> 1:19:57.208
was also elevated in relation
to the other holes.

1:19:57.367 --> 1:19:59.960
Silver was present only in F-4.

1:20:00.045 --> 1:20:01.787
So, there's something
unique about it.

1:20:01.871 --> 1:20:04.632
But here's the bottom line:
It's got gold in it.

1:20:04.716 --> 1:20:06.133
- (laughs)
- It's got gold in the water.

1:20:06.218 --> 1:20:07.968
And if it's got gold
in the water,

1:20:08.127 --> 1:20:09.470
the gold is
coming from somewhere.

1:20:10.630 --> 1:20:12.556
And that's where
the next steps come in.

1:20:12.715 --> 1:20:16.477
The next steps-- sampling that
till, sampling that sediment--

1:20:16.636 --> 1:20:20.481
Will help us fingerprint
exactly where and why

1:20:20.565 --> 1:20:24.401
that gold and silver
are elevated in that hole.

1:20:24.486 --> 1:20:27.062
As Dr. Pufahl said, the gold's
got to come from somewhere.

1:20:27.155 --> 1:20:30.658
And if it's coming from
the soil, there'd have to be

1:20:30.742 --> 1:20:34.745
a fair bit in-in the soil to
produce these anomalous results.

1:20:34.830 --> 1:20:38.490
We've got to get those till
sample and see what they hold.

1:20:38.583 --> 1:20:39.908
RICK:
This is great news.

1:20:40.001 --> 1:20:42.160
It-It's great science.

1:20:42.245 --> 1:20:44.663
Uh, I know Marty loves
great science.

1:20:44.747 --> 1:20:48.500
So does Craig and, uh,
everybody on the team.

1:20:48.585 --> 1:20:50.010
Can't add anything to that.

1:20:50.095 --> 1:20:52.671
Couple of weeks
to the gold, Rick.

1:20:52.755 --> 1:20:54.923
- (laughter)
- Calm down.

1:20:55.008 --> 1:20:57.926
I told you Bravo Tango
was coming at some point.

1:20:58.019 --> 1:20:59.595
What the hell?

1:20:59.688 --> 1:21:04.024
I would be lying if I said
it wasn't impactful.

1:21:05.277 --> 1:21:09.196
<i>(chuckles): I've believed
since I was a little guy.</i>

1:21:09.281 --> 1:21:12.774
<i>And it means something
to me on that level,</i>

1:21:12.859 --> 1:21:15.861
<i>that here's the proof.</i>

1:21:15.954 --> 1:21:18.539
Uh, it-it justifies
everything, right?

1:21:19.624 --> 1:21:22.367
<i>MARTY:
Gold is where it started.</i>

1:21:22.452 --> 1:21:25.704
<i>The search for gold is
what drove this way back,</i>

1:21:25.788 --> 1:21:28.290
<i>230 years ago almost now.</i>

1:21:28.374 --> 1:21:30.551
<i>So, nobody really found</i>

1:21:30.710 --> 1:21:32.878
<i>any direct evidence
of gold until now.</i>

1:21:32.962 --> 1:21:36.140
<i>Is this impactful?
It's hugely impactful.</i>

1:21:36.224 --> 1:21:38.800
<i>It looks like
there's some gold here.</i>

1:21:38.894 --> 1:21:41.729
So, it vindicates Rick
and, I guess, a little bit me.

1:21:41.888 --> 1:21:44.723
This is summed up
by two words, really:

1:21:44.807 --> 1:21:46.150
<i>Sempre Avanti.</i>

1:21:46.309 --> 1:21:47.318
Let's keep moving forward.

1:21:47.402 --> 1:21:49.320
Maybe we can get
to the bottom of this.

1:21:49.404 --> 1:21:52.156
- Absolutely. - Fair enough.
- Thank you.

1:21:52.315 --> 1:21:54.491
<i>- RICK: Okay. Thank you very much.
- IAN: Thank you. See ya.</i>

1:21:54.576 --> 1:21:58.329
<i>NARRATOR: A mystery

1:21:58.413 --> 1:22:01.156
<i>faith and hope drew them in,</i>

1:22:01.240 --> 1:22:05.753
<i>and now science has validated
their efforts and persistence.</i>

1:22:05.837 --> 1:22:08.339
<i>For brothers

1:22:08.498 --> 1:22:10.090

<i>the answers

1:22:13.169 --> 1:22:16.254
<i>for more than two centuries

1:22:17.349 --> 1:22:20.676
<i>However, they must still
brace for the unknown</i>

1:22:20.760 --> 1:22:24.271
<i>and the forces that are
beyond their control</i>

1:22:24.356 --> 1:22:28.767
<i>that have guarded the island's
secrets through the generations.</i>

1:22:28.851 --> 1:22:32.446
<i>Will the fellowship
finally zero in on a target</i>

1:22:32.605 --> 1:22:35.190
<i>that could change history
as we know it?</i>

1:22:35.274 --> 1:22:38.953
<i>Only time and fate will tell.</i>

1:22:42.281 --> 1:22:44.950
<i>This season on</i>
The Curse of Oak Island...

1:22:45.034 --> 1:22:47.378
We're back, Oak Island,
old friend.

1:22:47.537 --> 1:22:49.371
- Oh, it's a coin!
- Yes.

1:22:49.455 --> 1:22:51.790
- RICK: That's the aha.
- Yeah.

1:22:51.883 --> 1:22:53.458
<i>RICK: I still believe there's
some answers in the swamp.</i>

1:22:53.551 --> 1:22:55.719

to the Money Pit.

1:22:55.804 --> 1:22:58.213
Wow. These are
indigenous artifacts.

- Immediately.

1:23:01.726 --> 1:23:04.803

the more of our island we lose.

- Yeah.
<i>- We're gonna go bigger.</i>

1:23:10.986 --> 1:23:12.144

Nobody really found any evidence
