02:11.014 --> 02:13.516
Three fucking weeks
it takes you

02:13.516 --> 02:15.018
to put me on
your visitor's list?

02:15.518 --> 02:16.519
Just be careful.

02:16.519 --> 02:19.022
These motherless fucks
listen to everything.

02:19.022 --> 02:21.524
A nephew's
visiting his uncle...

02:22.025 --> 02:24.027
who loves him.

02:24.027 --> 02:25.528
I got nothing
to say to you.

02:26.029 --> 02:28.031
So many tragedies
and near tragedies
to those close to you.

02:28.031 --> 02:30.033
Don't be
so fucking smart.

02:30.033 --> 02:32.535
Things could have
gone the other way,
my little nephew.

02:33.036 --> 02:35.538
Yeah, but
they didn't.

02:35.538 --> 02:38.541
What's all this shit
i'm hearing about your heart?

02:38.541 --> 02:44.047
This problem
you and me had...

02:44.047 --> 02:47.050
i want you to know your mother
had nothing to do with it.

02:47.050 --> 02:48.551
She's dead to me.

02:48.551 --> 02:50.553
She's a sick woman,
she don't have all her marbles.

02:50.553 --> 02:52.055
Who the fuck
are you kidding?

02:52.055 --> 02:54.557
It's killing you
that people are talking...

02:55.058 --> 02:58.061
that an old woman
made an asshole out of you.

02:58.061 --> 02:59.562
Not half so bad
as certain rumors

02:59.562 --> 03:01.564
floating around
this place about you.

03:01.564 --> 03:04.567
How tony soprano likes to
fluff up his mother's pillow

03:04.567 --> 03:06.569
so she can get
a nice long sleep.

03:06.569 --> 03:08.071
Who said that?

03:08.071 --> 03:10.073
You want to make all this
nonsense disappear?

03:10.573 --> 03:12.075
Make peace with her,

03:12.075 --> 03:15.578
it'll look like no bad blood,
it'll be good for all of us.

03:15.578 --> 03:17.580
No fucking way.

03:17.580 --> 03:19.582
You tell
that fat fuck, bacala,

03:19.582 --> 03:23.086
tell him to come out
from his mouse hole,
i want to see him tomorrow.

03:23.086 --> 03:28.091
What for?

03:28.591 --> 03:31.094
The black man
industrialized the north

03:31.094 --> 03:33.096
but we're still
fighting for jobs.

03:33.096 --> 03:36.099
Over 25 joint- fitters
on this work site,

03:36.599 --> 03:39.102
not a black man
to be found.

03:39.102 --> 03:41.104
Tell'em, reverend.

03:41.104 --> 03:43.106
I'll tell you why.

03:43.106 --> 03:45.608
Black joint- fitters,
like all black artisans,

03:45.608 --> 03:48.111
have been shut out
of the union.

03:48.111 --> 03:52.115
Out of work while
their white joint- fitter

03:52.115 --> 03:54.617
is filling his stomach.

03:54.617 --> 03:58.621
My father put his life
on the line for this country.

03:58.621 --> 04:01.124
C'mon up here, papa.

04:01.124 --> 04:03.626
Somebody help
my papa up here.

04:04.127 --> 04:06.629
This is my papa!

04:06.629 --> 04:08.631
Fought in world war ii
, the war against tyranny,

04:08.631 --> 04:13.636
came home to establish
his own tabernacle.

04:14.137 --> 04:17.640
When he came home,
i said when he came home,

04:17.640 --> 04:20.642
he had to fight a differen
t kind of war all over again.

04:20.642 --> 04:29.152
Talk to them, papa,
talk to the people, papa.

04:29.152 --> 04:32.155
Since then we have
spilled our blood in korea,

04:32.155 --> 04:35.158
vietnam and iraq.

04:35.158 --> 04:37.660
Every time i say,
sweet jesus,

04:37.660 --> 04:40.663
let them do right by our boys
when they get back here.

04:41.164 --> 04:44.667
But somebody forgot
to tell the man.

04:44.667 --> 04:47.670
Now, you know
what i'm talking about.

04:47.670 --> 04:49.672
Tell them!

04:49.672 --> 04:51.674
Yes, i'm gonna
tell them.

04:51.674 --> 04:54.177
I'm gonna tell them no more
cutting us out.

04:54.177 --> 04:56.679
No more!

04:57.180 --> 04:58.681
No more!

04:58.681 --> 04:59.682
No more!

04:59.682 --> 05:01.184
No more!

05:01.184 --> 05:06.189
You hear that,
mr. Masserone brothers'
construction?

05:06.189 --> 05:08.191
No more!

05:08.191 --> 05:09.692
Somebody tell me
what we want!

05:09.692 --> 05:10.693
Jobs!

05:10.693 --> 05:11.694
When do we
want'em?

05:11.694 --> 05:12.695
Now!

05:12.695 --> 05:13.696
Want do we want?

05:13.696 --> 05:16.199
Jobs!

05:16.199 --> 05:17.700
Hey, med!

05:18.201 --> 05:20.703
I'm going to visit
"she who's name
may not be uttered".

05:20.703 --> 05:21.704
Wanna come?

05:21.704 --> 05:23.206
Grandma?
You mean like now?

05:23.706 --> 05:26.709
I'd really like to
but i gotta study my french.

05:26.709 --> 05:28.211
Stupid verbs.

05:28.211 --> 05:29.712
No biggie.

05:29.712 --> 05:31.214
Hey.

05:31.214 --> 05:34.717
I want
to talk to you.

05:34.717 --> 05:37.720
What the fuck were you doing
with that real estate sign?

05:37.720 --> 05:40.723
Oh, yeah, i wanted
to talk to you about that.

05:40.723 --> 05:42.725
I'm selling ma's house,
you understand, janice?

05:42.725 --> 05:45.728
Now put that fucking sign
back in the fucking ground
and that's it!

05:45.728 --> 05:47.230
End of discussion,
period!

05:47.730 --> 05:49.232
You're so
left- brain.

05:49.232 --> 05:51.234
Whether the sign's
there or not

05:51.234 --> 05:54.237
the house is still
for sale, the agent
still has the listing.

05:54.237 --> 05:56.739
Then what was the sign doing
in the back seat of your car?

05:56.739 --> 05:59.242
Don't try
to deny it!

05:59.742 --> 06:01.744
Because i'm trying
to save a little money,
is that alright?

06:02.245 --> 06:03.746
Do you remember
cathy fiola?

06:03.746 --> 06:06.749
She was in my class
at sacred heart
with the birthmark.

06:06.749 --> 06:08.251
What about her?

06:08.251 --> 06:09.752
She's in
real estate now.

06:09.752 --> 06:12.255
She said she'd only charge
a three percent commission.

06:12.755 --> 06:15.758
That's half, tony,
thousands of dollars.

06:15.758 --> 06:18.261
It may not mean
anything to you, but
maybe ma could use it.

06:18.261 --> 06:20.263
Yeah?
Fuck her.

06:20.263 --> 06:22.765
And next time
you disappear for a week,

06:22.765 --> 06:24.767
take that piece of shit and
park it in the fucking street!

06:25.268 --> 06:27.270
This isn't
a fucking hotel!

06:32.275 --> 06:35.278
We're out of cran- apple,
mrs. S. , is plain apple okay?

06:35.278 --> 06:37.780
Oh, sure, dear.

06:38.281 --> 06:39.282
Oh, honey?

06:39.282 --> 06:42.785
Do you suppose you could get me
some strawberry ice cream?

06:42.785 --> 06:46.789
They can't expect me
to eat this tapioca.

06:46.789 --> 06:48.791
I'll see
what i can do.

06:48.791 --> 06:52.795
She cracks me up.

06:52.795 --> 06:55.298
Well, i can't
believe it.

06:55.298 --> 06:58.301
It's my daughter
from california.

06:58.301 --> 06:59.802
It's seattle, ma.

06:59.802 --> 07:01.804
Would you like
some of my tapioca?

07:01.804 --> 07:03.306
Good morning.

07:03.306 --> 07:06.809
Oh, you reek
of cigarettes.

07:07.310 --> 07:08.811
Look at you.

07:09.312 --> 07:10.813
All dressed,
out of bed.

07:10.813 --> 07:12.815
You see my hand?

07:12.815 --> 07:14.317
It's all
black and blue

07:14.817 --> 07:17.320
from where they
stuck in the needle.

07:17.320 --> 07:18.321
That's how
you get better.

07:18.821 --> 07:19.822
You don't care.

07:20.323 --> 07:22.325
You weren't here
five minutes.

07:22.325 --> 07:25.328
I had to go to
the city for a few days.

07:25.328 --> 07:27.330
I'm pitching
my self- help video.

07:27.830 --> 07:30.333
"Lady kerouac",

07:30.333 --> 07:34.337
or "packing for the highwa
y to a woman's self- esteem."

07:34.337 --> 07:36.339
You could never
stand it here.

07:36.839 --> 07:38.341
You could never
stand yourself

07:38.341 --> 07:41.344
and that's
why you ran away.

07:41.844 --> 07:43.346
Let's not go there
today, ma.

07:43.346 --> 07:45.848
You think it was
easy for me?

07:45.848 --> 07:49.352
You don't know the kind of
man your father was!

07:49.352 --> 07:50.853
What do you mean?

07:50.853 --> 07:52.355
Nobody knows!

07:52.355 --> 07:54.357
Nobody knows
what i went through.

07:54.357 --> 07:57.860
What about daddy?

07:57.860 --> 07:59.862
One thing
i could tell you,

08:00.363 --> 08:04.367
it would kill him
to see me now.

08:04.367 --> 08:07.370
Here's your ice cream, mrs. S,
then we can take our walk.

08:07.370 --> 08:09.372
Leave me alone,
please.

08:09.872 --> 08:12.375
Open the window
and just push me out.

08:12.875 --> 08:15.378
I can't
take this anymore.

08:15.378 --> 08:17.380
Mrs. Soprano, what's wrong,
what happened?

08:17.380 --> 08:19.382
She just
started crying.

08:19.882 --> 08:21.884
You, i know
why you're here.

08:22.385 --> 08:23.886
You don't fool me
for a second.

08:23.886 --> 08:26.889
You're here because
you want to take my house.

08:27.390 --> 08:28.891
Ma!

08:28.891 --> 08:30.893
You don't know what goes
through this mind of mine.

08:31.394 --> 08:32.895
That's for
fucking sure!

08:32.895 --> 08:36.399
Someday i hope you have
children of your own

08:36.399 --> 08:38.400
and they treat you
like this.

08:38.900 --> 08:44.407
I gave my life to my children
on a silver platter.

08:44.407 --> 08:46.409
This is bullshit.

08:51.914 --> 08:53.416
Talk to me.

08:53.416 --> 08:55.918
These fucking activists,
they're killing me.

08:55.918 --> 08:57.420
They're picketing
my place 24- 7.

08:57.420 --> 08:59.422
Three days
i'm down already.

08:59.422 --> 09:00.923
Who?

09:00.923 --> 09:02.425
This hard- on,
rev. Herman james jr.

09:02.425 --> 09:03.926
He's an old song,

09:03.926 --> 09:05.928
not enough minorities
doing the joint fitting.

09:05.928 --> 09:07.430
You were told
the joint- fitters union

09:07.430 --> 09:08.931
is under my uncle's
jurisdiction.

09:09.432 --> 09:10.933
I know.

09:10.933 --> 09:12.435
But if you could pave the way
for me to talk to your uncle,

09:12.935 --> 09:14.437
so he could maybe
send some guys down

09:14.437 --> 09:16.439
and make it uncomfortable
for these people.

09:16.439 --> 09:18.441
Like you did with
your unions before.

09:18.441 --> 09:19.942
It's gonna
cost you.

09:19.942 --> 09:21.444
Besides what you're
already raping me

09:21.444 --> 09:22.945
for those no- show
electrician jobs?

09:23.446 --> 09:24.947
You're not such
a fucking citizen

09:24.947 --> 09:26.949
when you want a construction
bid to go your way.

09:26.949 --> 09:28.451
Take it easy.

09:28.451 --> 09:30.453
I'll see
what i can do.

09:30.453 --> 09:32.955
Meantime,
call animal control.

09:32.955 --> 09:35.458
Watch you don't
get followed meeting me.

09:50.973 --> 09:52.475
You're late.

09:52.475 --> 09:56.979
Bobby baccalieri,
the last man standing.

09:57.480 --> 09:59.482
I don't want to
say nothing, tony.

09:59.482 --> 10:00.983
You don't want to get
yourself in trouble.

10:01.484 --> 10:04.487
A lot of funerals in
your corner of the world,
huh, bobby?

10:04.487 --> 10:07.490
What'd you have to do,
refinance your house?

10:07.490 --> 10:10.493
Don't look at the floor,
bobby, look at me.

10:10.493 --> 10:13.496
I want you to talk
to that bald cocksucker

10:13.496 --> 10:15.998
who calls himself
my father's brother.

10:15.998 --> 10:18.501
Tell him i'm gonna let him
keep on earning.

10:19.001 --> 10:21.003
Subsistence level.

10:21.003 --> 10:24.507
He'll be able to pay
his defense lawyers.

10:24.507 --> 10:26.509
Let me say for him,

10:27.009 --> 10:28.010
thank you.

10:28.511 --> 10:30.513
You're gonna hear
some high- end shit.

10:31.013 --> 10:34.016
And "a", i hope
you could understand it,

10:34.016 --> 10:38.020
and "b", i hope you keep it
between this room and junior.

10:38.521 --> 10:40.523
Because if you don't,
i promise you,

10:40.523 --> 10:43.526
they're gonna find
pieces of you in
eight different dumpsters.

10:43.526 --> 10:45.027
I inherited junior.

10:45.027 --> 10:48.030
I don't think you got reason
to talk to me this way.

10:48.030 --> 10:50.032
I always liked you.

10:50.533 --> 10:51.534
Bullshit.

10:51.534 --> 10:53.536
But we'll assume
you do now.

10:53.536 --> 10:57.540
You tell my uncle that
he gets to keep five percent,

10:57.540 --> 11:00.543
five percent of his shy,
his sports betting,

11:01.043 --> 11:02.545
same with the coke.

11:02.545 --> 11:05.047
The joint- fitters union,
it's all his, okay?

11:05.047 --> 11:08.050
Bobby, listen,
this is very important.

11:08.050 --> 11:11.554
He also gets
to keep his stripes.

11:11.554 --> 11:13.055
As far as the feds
are concerned,

11:13.556 --> 11:15.558
they got the boss
of the family in jail,
awaiting trial,

11:16.058 --> 11:18.060
and if they hear different,
it creates confusion.

11:18.060 --> 11:19.562
Got it.

11:19.562 --> 11:22.565
As far as the rest of
everything that junior owned,

11:22.565 --> 11:28.571
it's now mine.

11:28.571 --> 11:30.573
I'll get this to him, tony.

11:30.573 --> 11:32.074
That's it.

11:39.582 --> 11:43.085
"To the victor,
belongs the spoils."

11:43.085 --> 11:44.587
Why don't you get
the fuck out of here

11:44.587 --> 11:48.090
before i shove
your quotations book
up your fat fucking ass!

11:53.095 --> 11:55.097
Mr. Bompensiero?

11:55.097 --> 11:57.600
Is your wife here
to drive you home?

11:57.600 --> 11:59.602
Skip.

12:04.607 --> 12:06.108
Skip?

12:13.115 --> 12:14.617
How we feeling?

12:14.617 --> 12:16.619
Fucking great.

12:16.619 --> 12:19.622
He's gonna be out of it
for another hour or so.

12:19.622 --> 12:22.625
The injection
went great.

12:22.625 --> 12:25.628
You'll feel the difference in
your back in a couple of days.

12:25.628 --> 12:27.630
Buzz me when he feels
ready to leave.

12:27.630 --> 12:29.632
Yeah, we'll
buzz you, honey.

12:30.132 --> 12:36.138
Bzz, bzz...

12:36.138 --> 12:38.641
my back don't feel
one iota different.

12:38.641 --> 12:41.644
Doctor said it'll take
a couple days for
the steroids to kick in.

12:41.644 --> 12:44.146
I gotta get
my jacuzzi.

12:44.146 --> 12:46.649
Too much stress
in your life, sal.

12:46.649 --> 12:49.151
Tony doesn't know
you're back yet, does he?

12:49.151 --> 12:52.154
Jesus christ, no,
i didn't go see him yet.

12:52.154 --> 12:54.156
You guys
are all alike.

12:54.156 --> 12:56.158
We've seen guys
drag their dicks before,

12:56.659 --> 12:58.661
take advantage of
the government's generosity,

12:59.161 --> 13:01.163
playing both ends
against the middle.

13:01.163 --> 13:03.666
Will you give me
a window over here?

13:03.666 --> 13:05.167
Tony already thinks
maybe i flipped.

13:05.167 --> 13:07.169
I gotta
be careful.

13:07.169 --> 13:09.171
Jimmy altieri
ate the pill for you.

13:09.171 --> 13:10.172
Any suspicion abou
t being an informant

13:10.673 --> 13:12.675
went to the grave
with jimmy altieri.

13:12.675 --> 13:13.676
Yeah, yeah.

13:13.676 --> 13:15.678
I know tony 30 years,
now this?

13:15.678 --> 13:17.179
Spare me, okay?

13:17.179 --> 13:18.681
You've been on our tit
since'98.

13:18.681 --> 13:20.683
Fucking chauffeur service
to and from the doctor,

13:20.683 --> 13:22.184
that we had
to find for you.

13:22.184 --> 13:24.687
If we're gonna let you
back on the streets and earn,

13:24.687 --> 13:26.188
we want results.

13:26.188 --> 13:28.691
The fuck tried to
suffocate his own mother!

13:28.691 --> 13:30.192
She's a disgrace.

13:30.192 --> 13:32.194
His own uncle
wanted him whacked.

13:32.695 --> 13:35.197
You said so for yourself,
he's been shitting
on you for years.

13:35.197 --> 13:37.199
I know
what i said.

13:37.700 --> 13:39.702
Plus he's been crying
to a shrink twice a week.

13:39.702 --> 13:41.704
You don't
owe this man dick.

13:41.704 --> 13:42.705
Don't sit there
and tell me

13:43.205 --> 13:44.707
you're gonna take a bullet
for some yuppie

13:44.707 --> 13:48.210
who thinks
you're his errand boy.

13:48.711 --> 13:50.212
Your honor,

13:50.212 --> 13:52.715
this man should not be
removed from custody
for medical reasons.

13:52.715 --> 13:55.217
Every time we get one
of these elder mafiosos
incarcerated,

13:55.217 --> 13:57.219
we get the same
bag of tricks.

13:57.720 --> 13:59.722
Your honor,
i take offense

14:00.222 --> 14:02.725
to the characterization
of my client as a mafioso.

14:03.225 --> 14:06.228
Mr. Soprano has not been
found guilty of anything.

14:06.228 --> 14:08.731
He's awaiting trial
for alleged offenses.

14:08.731 --> 14:10.232
Noted.

14:10.232 --> 14:12.234
With all due respect to
the state's medical facilities,

14:12.234 --> 14:16.739
in his condition,
mr. Soprano has every right

14:16.739 --> 14:20.242
to pursue the best
possible medical care
that he can afford.

14:20.242 --> 14:23.245
Mr. Soprano is suffering
from a very benign illness,

14:23.245 --> 14:25.247
a few clogged arteries,
your honor.

14:25.247 --> 14:27.249
I'm leaning towards releasing
this man from lock- up

14:27.750 --> 14:31.754
unless you can demonstrate
a serious flight risk.

14:31.754 --> 14:35.758
Mr. Soprano,
if i approve this

14:35.758 --> 14:39.261
you will be under
what is called "house arrest".

14:39.261 --> 14:40.763
Do you understand
this concept?

14:40.763 --> 14:42.264
Not really.

14:42.765 --> 14:46.268
It means that you must remain
in your primary residence

14:46.268 --> 14:47.770
and cannot leave,

14:47.770 --> 14:51.774
except for
doctor's appointments,
food shopping.

14:51.774 --> 14:53.275
Your honor,

14:53.275 --> 14:55.778
the government asks for
an electronic bracelet.

14:56.278 --> 14:59.281
Your honor, while we certainly
agree to house arrest,

14:59.782 --> 15:04.286
we are asking that mr. Soprano
not be further persecuted

15:04.286 --> 15:06.789
for yet to be
proven allegations.

15:06.789 --> 15:11.293
He shows no prior arrest
since 1968.

15:11.293 --> 15:12.795
He pays his taxes,

15:13.295 --> 15:15.297
and he's a veteran
of the second world war.

15:15.297 --> 15:17.800
Mr. Soprano,
do you have any problem

15:18.300 --> 15:20.803
with wearing
an electronic bracelet?

15:20.803 --> 15:23.305
It sounds like
nazi germany to me.

15:23.305 --> 15:27.810
Obviously, you need
a history lesson, sir.

15:28.310 --> 15:30.813
I don't think that we--
you and i,

15:30.813 --> 15:35.317
should let our shared
sorrow or biases
enter into this, judge.

15:35.317 --> 15:37.319
He's wearing
a bracelet...

15:37.319 --> 15:44.326
to avoid any risk
of flight.

15:57.840 --> 15:58.841
Who are you?

15:59.341 --> 16:00.843
Jesus christ, you scared
the shit out of me.

16:01.343 --> 16:03.345
Jesus ain't got
nothing to do with it.

16:03.345 --> 16:05.848
Now what do you
want here?

16:06.348 --> 16:08.851
Looking for your son,
is he around?

16:08.851 --> 16:09.852
You a friend?

16:09.852 --> 16:11.353
Is he around?

16:11.353 --> 16:15.858
He'll be
back here soon.

16:15.858 --> 16:17.860
Well, c'mon in.

16:29.371 --> 16:31.874
You were a good- looking
guy back then.

16:31.874 --> 16:34.376
Still am.

16:34.376 --> 16:37.379
Still got the same teeth
as in that picture.

16:37.379 --> 16:38.380
Oh, yeah?

16:38.881 --> 16:40.883
Go on and laugh.

16:41.383 --> 16:44.887
Picture was taken
57 years ago.

16:44.887 --> 16:46.889
So that makes you...?

16:46.889 --> 16:48.390
Old.

16:48.891 --> 16:50.392
C'mon,
how old are you?

16:50.392 --> 16:51.393
75.

16:51.393 --> 16:53.395
Add eight more
and you got it.

16:53.395 --> 16:55.397
83, get the fuck
out of here.

16:55.397 --> 16:57.399
What do you want
with my son?

16:57.399 --> 16:59.902
Got a little business
i gotta discuss with him.

16:59.902 --> 17:01.904
If you say so.

17:02.404 --> 17:05.907
So, you're 28 years old
when world war ii starts.

17:05.907 --> 17:08.911
That's a little long
in the tooth, isn't it?

17:08.911 --> 17:11.413
'43, they was
taking everyone,

17:11.914 --> 17:13.415
no matter how old
or how ugly.

17:13.915 --> 17:16.417
Even took this
fat boy i knew.

17:16.417 --> 17:19.421
He was already 34.

17:19.421 --> 17:22.424
Wasn't no good to nobody,
except he could cook.

17:22.424 --> 17:25.426
I swear he was more dangerous
with that stove

17:25.426 --> 17:28.430
than he was
with that rifle.

17:28.430 --> 17:30.432
You ever watch
the history channel?

17:30.432 --> 17:31.433
Television?

17:31.934 --> 17:33.435
No, this is
the history channel.

17:33.435 --> 17:34.937
I think
you'd like it.

17:34.937 --> 17:37.439
They even do a lot of
that bible shit.

17:37.439 --> 17:39.441
Only shit in the bible
came out of pharaoh's ass

17:39.942 --> 17:41.944
when moses
parted the red sea.

17:41.944 --> 17:46.448
Parted the red sea,
praise his name.

17:46.448 --> 17:51.453
Never underestimate a man's
determination to be free.

17:59.461 --> 18:00.963
Um...

18:00.963 --> 18:03.465
i'll catch up with your son
another time.

18:17.479 --> 18:20.482
You break that,
you're paying for it.

18:28.991 --> 18:31.994
If i'd have known you
were gonna get out so fast
with this medical shit

18:31.994 --> 18:34.496
i never would've talked
to that calzone with legs.

18:34.496 --> 18:35.998
He gave me
the message.

18:35.998 --> 18:38.500
Don't fucking pout.

18:38.500 --> 18:43.005
Be grateful
i'm letting you earn.

18:43.005 --> 18:46.508
What's on your mind?

18:46.508 --> 18:48.510
How'd you swing this?

18:48.510 --> 18:51.513
This dr. Schreck,
he's monty schreck's kid.

18:51.513 --> 18:55.517
Monty, the bookie's son?
He's a cardiologist.

18:55.517 --> 18:57.519
That's not bad.

18:57.519 --> 18:59.521
Law says feds can't
bug your doctor's office.

19:00.022 --> 19:01.523
Let's me use this place
whenever i need to

19:01.523 --> 19:04.526
to conduct business.

19:05.027 --> 19:08.030
So, you heard about
masserone construction?

19:08.030 --> 19:10.532
Bacala is
taking care of it.

19:10.532 --> 19:13.535
The joint- fitters
know he speaks for me.

19:13.535 --> 19:15.537
It's gotta go
60- 40, my way.

19:15.537 --> 19:17.039
Did you do
what i asked?

19:17.039 --> 19:19.541
What did you
ask me to do?

19:19.541 --> 19:21.043
You know,
make peace.

19:21.543 --> 19:23.045
You listen...

19:23.045 --> 19:25.547
that's enough with that shit,
that woman is dead to me.

19:25.547 --> 19:27.049
You let it go!

19:27.049 --> 19:29.051
Why the fuck should i
? she's my brother's wife.

19:29.051 --> 19:31.053
She doesn't realize
what she says half the time.

19:31.053 --> 19:33.055
Let's put our cards
on the table here.

19:33.055 --> 19:37.059
I heard your radio debut
on those tapes the feds
made at green grove.

19:37.059 --> 19:39.561
So she doesn't know what
she's saying half the time.

19:39.561 --> 19:41.563
Which half
did you listen to?

19:41.563 --> 19:43.065
The half that doesn't
make any sense,

19:43.565 --> 19:45.567
or the half that
we both know played you
like a fucking child?

19:45.567 --> 19:47.069
Nobody played me.

19:47.569 --> 19:50.572
She didn't know that she was
setting you up to get popped.

19:50.572 --> 19:51.573
That's right.

19:52.074 --> 19:54.576
Your uncle isn't
as dumb as you think.

19:54.576 --> 19:57.079
You and that
miserable fuck, altieri.

19:57.079 --> 19:59.081
That rat bastard,
all of my capos,

19:59.081 --> 20:01.083
meeting behind my back.

20:01.083 --> 20:02.584
Let sleeping dogs
lie, okay?

20:03.085 --> 20:06.088
I have my reasons.

20:06.088 --> 20:08.090
I'll tell you one dog
you left still barking,

20:08.090 --> 20:09.591
that fucking
freddie capuano.

20:10.092 --> 20:13.095
That motherless money- grubbing
little son- of- a- bitch--

20:13.095 --> 20:16.598
the guy who owns green grove
retirement community?

20:17.099 --> 20:18.600
He's like
an old fucking lady!

20:18.600 --> 20:20.602
He's been going around
telling soprano business

20:20.602 --> 20:22.604
to anybody
who'll listen!

20:22.604 --> 20:24.106
He's the one that's been
saying that shit

20:24.606 --> 20:26.108
about you trying
to whack your mother.

20:26.108 --> 20:28.110
Even implied
that me and her...

20:28.110 --> 20:31.113
that hairpiece
motherfucker.

20:40.122 --> 20:43.125
Did everybody take a vow
of silence or something?

20:43.125 --> 20:45.127
Nobody's got
anything to report?

20:45.127 --> 20:48.130
I gotta write a report
on dna for biology.

20:48.130 --> 20:50.132
Isn't that
interesting?

20:50.632 --> 20:52.634
I just saw
on "inside edition"

20:52.634 --> 20:56.138
how there will be
no more unknown soldiers

20:56.138 --> 20:57.639
because of
dna now.

20:58.140 --> 21:00.642
They will be able to
identify every single
casualty of combat.

21:00.642 --> 21:02.644
Pass me more of that
macaroni and cheese.

21:02.644 --> 21:05.147
You know, tony,

21:05.147 --> 21:08.150
i know you don't like
to talk about her, but...

21:08.150 --> 21:10.152
that woman
is impossible.

21:10.152 --> 21:16.658
She's a complete narcissist,
i mean,"me, me, me".

21:16.658 --> 21:18.660
Really kudos.

21:18.660 --> 21:20.162
You are a saint.

21:20.162 --> 21:22.664
You were right the first time,
i don't want to talk about it.

21:23.165 --> 21:26.668
You talking
about grandma?

21:26.668 --> 21:29.671
She pushes those buttons,
she's a big baby.

21:29.671 --> 21:31.673
You know?

21:37.179 --> 21:38.680
Excusez- moi.

21:38.680 --> 21:41.183
Tony.

21:41.183 --> 21:43.185
This is my house.

21:43.185 --> 21:45.187
How many times
i gotta say it?

21:45.187 --> 21:47.189
Thank you,
il duce.

21:47.189 --> 21:48.690
You got
something to say?

21:48.690 --> 21:50.192
The little girl who's
about to get her license

21:50.692 --> 21:52.194
might want to use one of
those cars in driveway

21:52.194 --> 21:54.196
in the next
hundred years.

21:54.196 --> 21:56.198
It's my fault, med.

21:56.198 --> 22:02.204
I wasn't sensitive
to his feelings.

22:02.704 --> 22:04.206
Thank you.

22:04.206 --> 22:05.707
You see that?

22:05.707 --> 22:08.210
You see how
easy that was?

22:08.210 --> 22:10.712
So, mr. Delegated
power of attorney,

22:11.213 --> 22:13.215
have you given it
any thought?

22:13.215 --> 22:15.217
Can my girlfriend
have the listing?

22:15.717 --> 22:17.219
You know,
of the house?

22:17.719 --> 22:18.720
As long
as it gets sold,

22:19.221 --> 22:24.726
i don't give a fuck
who lists it.

22:24.726 --> 22:27.229
Hey, what did one prick
say to the other prick?

22:27.229 --> 22:28.730
You see that?

22:29.231 --> 22:32.234
See what happens with you
cursing at the dinner table?

23:12.274 --> 23:14.276
Thanks for this,
aunt par,

23:14.276 --> 23:16.778
it's hard to find people
over 25 to drive with.

23:16.778 --> 23:18.780
Just don't let them know
you drove me to buy some pot,

23:18.780 --> 23:20.282
which should
be legal.

23:20.282 --> 23:22.784
It's the only things
that works for these hands.

23:22.784 --> 23:24.286
Med, wasn't that
a stop sign?

23:24.286 --> 23:26.788
I just hate the way
he thinks he can talk to you.

23:26.788 --> 23:27.789
It's so obnoxious.

23:27.789 --> 23:29.291
He's insecure.

23:29.291 --> 23:30.792
He's afraid
to leave new jersey

23:31.293 --> 23:33.795
and he's threatened
by anybody who's broken free.

23:33.795 --> 23:35.297
He's too pathetic.

23:35.297 --> 23:37.299
How about grandma
in that rehab center?

23:37.799 --> 23:39.801
I know, i'm dying
to go over and see her,

23:39.801 --> 23:41.303
but i've had
so much homework,

23:41.803 --> 23:43.805
plus all this community service
you have to do

23:43.805 --> 23:45.807
to even think about getting
into a decent college.

23:46.308 --> 23:47.809
I bring food
to homeless shelters.

23:48.310 --> 23:49.811
You know grandma
pretty well,
don't you?

23:50.312 --> 23:51.313
I guess.

23:51.313 --> 23:53.315
What is she into?

23:53.315 --> 23:56.818
I don't know,
negativity?

23:56.818 --> 23:57.819
Seriously,

23:58.320 --> 24:00.322
there must be something
that gives her pleasure.

24:00.322 --> 24:01.823
Isn't there anything
she likes doing?

24:01.823 --> 24:04.326
My dad used to try and find her
these old records,

24:04.326 --> 24:07.329
these sisters.

24:07.329 --> 24:11.333
Oh, the de castro sisters,
right.

24:11.333 --> 24:15.337
The andrews sisters
would have been too easy.

24:15.337 --> 24:17.839
He used to bring her
that mario lasagna guy.

24:17.839 --> 24:20.842
Oh, yuck,
i hated that shit.

24:30.352 --> 24:33.855
Your glasses
will be ready on thursday.

24:33.855 --> 24:35.857
Thursday,
that's good.

24:36.358 --> 24:37.859
Did you see me
on tv?

24:37.859 --> 24:39.861
You were on tv?

24:40.362 --> 24:41.363
What show?

24:41.363 --> 24:42.864
The evening news.

24:42.864 --> 24:44.366
Oh, yeah.

24:44.366 --> 24:46.868
What about it?

24:46.868 --> 24:48.870
How'd i look?
Be honest.

24:49.371 --> 24:52.374
You looked, you know,
like you.

24:52.874 --> 24:53.875
You looked good.

24:54.376 --> 25:01.383
I didn't like
the way i looked.

25:01.383 --> 25:03.885
Maybe i should get new frames,
what do you think?

25:03.885 --> 25:08.390
What's wrong
with them?

25:08.890 --> 25:11.893
How much those frames
set you back?

25:11.893 --> 25:14.396
Insurance pays,
i never see the bill.

25:14.396 --> 25:15.897
Nice country.

25:15.897 --> 25:18.400
I got cataracts.

25:18.900 --> 25:20.902
My father told me,
"never get old."

25:20.902 --> 25:22.904
I should have
listened to him.

25:22.904 --> 25:26.908
Yeah.

25:26.908 --> 25:30.412
A chinaman goes
to see the eye doctor,

25:30.412 --> 25:32.914
after the exam
the doctor says,

25:32.914 --> 25:34.916
"i know why
you're having trouble."

25:35.417 --> 25:36.418
Chinaman says,
"why?"

25:36.418 --> 25:38.420
Doctor says,
"you have a cataract."

25:38.420 --> 25:43.925
Chinaman says,"no,
i have a rincoln continental."

25:43.925 --> 25:46.428
You don't
get it?

25:46.428 --> 25:50.432
I get it,
he drives a lincoln.

25:50.432 --> 25:51.933
What?

26:26.968 --> 26:28.970
Excuse me,
where's the men's room?

26:29.471 --> 26:31.973
Through the doors
to the left.

27:01.002 --> 27:02.504
You're awake.

27:02.504 --> 27:04.506
What--
what is that?

27:04.506 --> 27:06.508
That music?

27:06.508 --> 27:08.510
"Non ti scordar di me."

27:09.010 --> 27:10.512
Pavarotti.

27:10.512 --> 27:12.013
Did you bring it?

27:12.013 --> 27:16.518
I never forgot how much
you liked a good tenor.

27:16.518 --> 27:19.521
Remember when we saw
mario lanza on tv?

27:19.521 --> 27:22.023
You and me and daddy
on the sofa,

27:22.023 --> 27:25.527
watching ed sullivan.

27:25.527 --> 27:28.029
I don't think we ever
missed a sunday.

27:28.029 --> 27:31.032
Oh, my god
, my children.

27:31.032 --> 27:33.535
Music hath charms, ma.

27:33.535 --> 27:35.537
Thank god, huh?

28:51.613 --> 28:54.616
I think it's time for you
to start to seriously
consider salads.

28:54.616 --> 28:56.618
What do you mean?

28:56.618 --> 28:58.620
What do i mean.

28:58.620 --> 29:02.624
Get off my car before
you flip it over,
you fat fuck.

29:03.124 --> 29:05.126
Junior wants
to know when.

29:05.627 --> 29:08.630
Tomorrow morning.

29:09.130 --> 29:16.638
We're short a couple of guys,
so make sure you're there.

29:16.638 --> 29:18.640
Consider it exercise.

29:27.148 --> 29:28.149
"Fat fuck."

29:28.650 --> 29:30.151
Why don't you look
in the mirror some time,

29:30.151 --> 29:35.657
you insensitive
cocksucker.

29:35.657 --> 29:38.660
Tony,
we're sitting down!

29:38.660 --> 29:40.662
Ma, dna,
it's invisible, right?

29:41.162 --> 29:44.165
But guess how many nucleotides
are in each strand.

29:44.165 --> 29:45.166
Just tell her.

29:45.166 --> 29:47.168
A hundred million.

29:47.168 --> 29:48.670
Wow,
that's amazing.

29:48.670 --> 29:51.172
She knows
what time we eat.

29:51.172 --> 29:55.677
I don't want you
setting a place for her
if she's not here.

29:56.177 --> 30:01.182
Anthony jr. ,
want to do the honors?

30:01.182 --> 30:04.686
Bless us our lord
on thy gifts
we're about to receive...

30:04.686 --> 30:08.189
hello!

30:08.690 --> 30:10.191
You guys started
without me.

30:10.692 --> 30:12.694
Good, great.

30:12.694 --> 30:16.197
Bless us
our lord, amen.

30:16.197 --> 30:18.199
Janice, you know
what time we eat.

30:18.700 --> 30:21.202
If you're gonna be late, call,
or you're not gonna eat.

30:21.202 --> 30:26.708
Don't send me
to bed hungry, daddy.

30:26.708 --> 30:29.711
Everybody, guess who passed
her driving test today?

30:29.711 --> 30:31.212
She learned
from the best.

30:31.212 --> 30:32.714
Go, girl!

30:32.714 --> 30:35.216
I had to parallel park
behind this van

30:35.216 --> 30:36.718
and i was so nervous.

30:36.718 --> 30:38.720
The guy was a
real dork with a
clipboard and everything.

30:38.720 --> 30:42.223
Oh, wow,
fascist martinet.

30:42.223 --> 30:44.726
Salsice, janice?

30:44.726 --> 30:46.728
Oh, i forgot,
you don't eat pork...

30:47.228 --> 30:48.229
no.

30:48.730 --> 30:52.233
...in that way.

30:52.233 --> 30:53.735
Oh, i get it.

30:54.235 --> 30:57.238
There's nothing to get,
she's a vegetarian.

31:10.251 --> 31:14.255
I missed the fireflies
out west.

31:14.255 --> 31:18.760
That's why
i moved out here.

31:18.760 --> 31:25.266
Little bit
of nature.

31:25.266 --> 31:26.768
When you were
in seattle,

31:27.268 --> 31:29.270
you ever drive
by jimmy hendrix's house?

31:29.270 --> 31:30.772
Mm- mmm.

31:37.779 --> 31:40.281
You know, tony,

31:40.281 --> 31:43.284
i know it's not your
favorite subject, but...

31:43.785 --> 31:47.288
we had some really great news
about ma at the hospital today.

31:47.288 --> 31:51.292
Her rehab therapist says
she's making tremendous strides

31:51.292 --> 31:53.294
and it's not gonna
be long before
they release her.

31:53.294 --> 31:55.296
How can she make
tremendous strides

31:55.296 --> 31:57.799
when there's nothing
wrong with her
in the first place?

31:57.799 --> 31:59.300
It's called
face- saving therapy.

31:59.300 --> 32:02.303
The patient has to believe
that they're getting therapy.

32:02.303 --> 32:04.305
Believe me, medicare's
not gonna pay for it

32:04.806 --> 32:06.808
if it's not
as necessary as real,
would they?

32:06.808 --> 32:10.311
And the taxpayer
foots the bill.

32:10.311 --> 32:12.313
It's not
much longer now.

32:12.313 --> 32:15.316
But she's gonna
need a place to stay.

32:15.316 --> 32:17.819
She's out
on the street.

32:17.819 --> 32:20.822
Tony, it is
her house.

32:20.822 --> 32:22.824
Dead people
don't have houses.

32:22.824 --> 32:25.326
Daddy bought
that house.

32:30.832 --> 32:32.834
Tell you what...

32:32.834 --> 32:34.836
take her back
to green grove.

32:34.836 --> 32:36.838
What,
the nursing home?

32:36.838 --> 32:39.340
It's a
retirement community.

32:39.340 --> 32:45.346
You know i don't have
that kind of money.

32:45.847 --> 32:46.848
Fuck you.

32:56.357 --> 32:58.359
You should've seen the look
on that blimp's face

32:58.359 --> 33:00.361
when i told him
he had to be here today.

33:00.361 --> 33:01.863
Bacala's always
been a lazy bastard.

33:02.363 --> 33:04.365
You can't get nobody
good anymore.

33:04.365 --> 33:05.867
They're either
on fucking drugs

33:05.867 --> 33:07.368
or compromised
with the law,

33:07.368 --> 33:08.870
or they're young and
don't listen to orders.

33:08.870 --> 33:10.371
Please.

33:10.371 --> 33:12.874
It's all
"me, me, me".

33:12.874 --> 33:15.376
I hope you don't feel
that way about me, tony.

33:15.376 --> 33:16.878
It's just this back.

33:16.878 --> 33:18.379
You done plenty.

33:18.379 --> 33:20.882
You paid your dues.

33:28.389 --> 33:31.392
That's
tony soprano.

33:31.392 --> 33:32.894
What the fuck?

33:32.894 --> 33:34.395
Hey, tony!

33:34.395 --> 33:39.901
This is what i'm talking about,
motherfucker.

33:39.901 --> 33:42.403
Am i supposed to be seen here,
you fucking idiots?

33:42.403 --> 33:45.907
Now we look
like jerkoffs.

33:53.414 --> 33:55.416
Get out of
the way!

33:55.416 --> 33:58.920
When do
we want'em?

33:58.920 --> 34:00.922
We want to talk
to your foreman.

34:00.922 --> 34:02.924
You want to talk
to the foreskin?

34:02.924 --> 34:04.926
You a wise- ass
motherfucker.

34:04.926 --> 34:08.429
Keep your mother
off the streets
and i won't fuck her.

34:19.940 --> 34:23.945
Justice...

34:23.945 --> 34:27.949
motherfucker,
c'mon?

34:36.456 --> 34:37.958
Hi, ma.

34:37.958 --> 34:40.460
Oh, nicholas antonelli.

34:40.460 --> 34:43.965
Dead at age 73,
of heart failure.

34:43.965 --> 34:46.967
Mmm...
so, ma...

34:46.967 --> 34:49.469
you're gonna be
getting out of here soon.

34:49.469 --> 34:51.472
Want to go home?

34:51.472 --> 34:52.974
Home?

34:52.974 --> 34:54.976
Back to the house?

34:54.976 --> 34:57.478
My house?

34:57.478 --> 34:58.980
Uh- huh.

34:58.980 --> 35:01.983
No, i don't think so,
i'll go back to
the other place.

35:01.983 --> 35:03.985
To the nursing home?

35:03.985 --> 35:06.487
That's for people
who don't have anybody
to look after them.

35:06.988 --> 35:08.489
Oh, it's
not that bad.

35:08.489 --> 35:10.992
And they give you
fresh towels every day.

35:10.992 --> 35:13.494
Barbara said
you hated it.

35:13.494 --> 35:14.996
It's too much
trouble.

35:15.496 --> 35:17.498
No, ma, you can't
go back there.

35:17.498 --> 35:19.000
Why not?

35:19.000 --> 35:21.002
Because.

35:21.502 --> 35:25.006
Because,
it's dangerous there.

35:25.506 --> 35:27.008
What are you
talking about?

35:27.008 --> 35:30.511
The owner...
is missing.

35:30.511 --> 35:32.513
Mr. Capuano?

35:33.014 --> 35:35.016
They suspect
foul play.

35:35.016 --> 35:36.517
Yeah.

35:43.524 --> 35:45.026
Ma.

35:45.026 --> 35:49.530
Ma, you okay?

35:49.530 --> 35:51.032
Nurse!

35:51.032 --> 35:56.037
It's my mother.

35:56.037 --> 35:57.538
What is it?

35:57.538 --> 35:59.040
What's the matter?

35:59.040 --> 36:00.541
Are you okay,
mrs. Soprano?

36:01.042 --> 36:02.043
Oh.

36:02.043 --> 36:03.544
Take a deep breath.

36:03.544 --> 36:05.046
Breathe.

36:05.546 --> 36:08.049
Why do they make
cookies that way?

36:08.049 --> 36:10.051
You scared me, ma.

36:10.051 --> 36:12.553
Would you just stop it,
stop it!

36:12.553 --> 36:16.557
Just give me a minute,
go, go, stop hovering.

36:22.063 --> 36:24.565
Perhaps this is a good time
to talk about this.

36:24.565 --> 36:27.068
There's no emergency provision
for your mother on file.

36:27.568 --> 36:29.570
I tried to talk
to her about a dnr

36:29.570 --> 36:31.572
and she got
very agitated.

36:31.572 --> 36:32.573
Dnr?

36:32.573 --> 36:34.075
"Do not resuscitate."

36:34.075 --> 36:36.077
It's to save the family
a lot of anguish and decisions

36:36.577 --> 36:37.578
at a difficult time,

36:38.079 --> 36:40.081
when there is
no quality of life.

36:40.081 --> 36:43.084
Janice, where are
my glasses?

36:43.084 --> 36:46.087
I can't find the tissues,
janice!

36:46.087 --> 36:48.089
I'm sorry, tony,

36:48.589 --> 36:51.092
but the hospital is gonna
need a decision on this.

36:51.092 --> 36:52.593
Auxiliary "b",
what the fuck?

36:53.094 --> 36:55.096
It you're gonna have
power of attorney, tony,

36:55.096 --> 36:57.098
you're gonna have to
act like one.

36:57.598 --> 36:59.100
Who gives a fuck,
dnr, no dnr?

36:59.100 --> 37:01.102
Yeah, okay, great,

37:01.102 --> 37:03.604
so then what happens
when she goes into a coma

37:03.604 --> 37:05.606
and they have to keep her alive
with tubes and machines,

37:05.606 --> 37:07.108
because you won't
sign the dnr?

37:07.108 --> 37:08.109
What?!

37:08.109 --> 37:09.610
When she becomes
a vegetable

37:09.610 --> 37:11.112
she's not gonna
give a fuck about anything!

37:11.612 --> 37:13.614
To deprive your mother
of a place of live.

37:13.614 --> 37:18.119
To deprive me my chance
to make peace with my mother.

37:18.119 --> 37:19.120
You know what,
janice?

37:19.620 --> 37:20.621
Take her,
you can have her.

37:21.122 --> 37:23.124
The two of you in that house,
you deserve each other.

37:23.124 --> 37:24.625
It'd be worth it
just to watch.

37:24.625 --> 37:28.129
It'll be like,
"whatever happened to
baby janice over there."

37:28.129 --> 37:34.135
I'll give you
your fucking dnr!

37:34.135 --> 37:36.137
Mom, i can't
find the keys.

37:36.137 --> 37:38.139
Keys to what,
to the car?

37:38.139 --> 37:40.141
You got
a driver's license,

37:40.141 --> 37:43.144
not a license to g
o carousing around
on a school night.

37:43.144 --> 37:46.147
Mother, i was going to take
anthony to visit grandma.

37:46.147 --> 37:47.648
You said
we can visit her.

37:47.648 --> 37:49.650
If you want
to drive us, fine.

37:49.650 --> 37:51.652
Now you want to
visit grandma?

37:51.652 --> 37:55.156
Can we mom?

37:55.156 --> 37:57.658
No funny business.

37:57.658 --> 37:59.660
You go to
the hospital and back.

37:59.660 --> 38:02.163
The level of trust
in this family,

38:02.163 --> 38:04.165
check the mileage
if you want to.

38:04.165 --> 38:09.170
God.

38:09.670 --> 38:11.672
You go ahead,
i'll come down later.

38:11.672 --> 38:13.174
Why, where are
you going?

38:13.174 --> 38:15.676
Hunter's back in
"eating disorders"
upstairs.

38:16.177 --> 38:17.178
No, that's not fair.

38:17.178 --> 38:18.679
I'm just gonna
say hello.

38:18.679 --> 38:20.681
I'm telling.

38:20.681 --> 38:24.185
I was gonna let you
drive in the ibm
parking lot this sunday.

38:41.702 --> 38:43.704
Look who's here!

38:43.704 --> 38:45.206
Anthony,
come over here.

38:45.706 --> 38:48.209
Give your
grandma a kiss.

38:48.209 --> 38:49.210
Oh...

38:49.210 --> 38:50.711
ah...

38:50.711 --> 38:52.713
i thought
you were janice.

38:52.713 --> 38:57.718
She comes over everyday
to play pinochle with me.

38:57.718 --> 39:01.722
Daughters take better care
of their mothers, that's why.

39:01.722 --> 39:06.227
She's home,
i think.

39:06.227 --> 39:09.730
You didn't ride over here
on your bicycle in the dark?

39:10.231 --> 39:11.732
No, meadow
drove me.

39:12.233 --> 39:14.735
Meadow?
Well, where is she?

39:15.236 --> 39:16.737
I don't know.

39:16.737 --> 39:17.738
She's another one.

39:17.738 --> 39:19.740
They don't care
what happens to you, johnny.

39:20.241 --> 39:22.243
They stick you
away somewhere

39:22.243 --> 39:24.245
and they forget
you ever existed.

39:24.245 --> 39:25.746
I guess.

39:25.746 --> 39:27.748
Have a torrone.

39:27.748 --> 39:30.251
No, i don't like
those italian candies.

39:30.251 --> 39:32.753
Go ahead,
take one.

39:38.259 --> 39:40.261
He's not even
washing his hands.

39:40.261 --> 39:43.764
You know the thing about
louisiana food,

39:43.764 --> 39:47.268
is that it's not really spicy,
it's just well- seasoned.

39:47.268 --> 39:48.769
Don't we season
everything down there?

39:48.769 --> 39:50.271
Absolutely.

39:50.771 --> 39:52.773
So what we're
gonna do is i got a
little cayenne pepper...

39:52.773 --> 39:55.276
grandma, what's dnr?

39:55.776 --> 39:56.777
Who?

39:56.777 --> 39:58.279
Dnr, it's initials,

39:58.279 --> 40:00.281
like, i had to do
this report on dna,

40:00.281 --> 40:03.784
but i heard dad and
aunt parvati talking
about your dnr.

40:03.784 --> 40:05.786
So, is that
like similar?

40:06.287 --> 40:08.789
Aunt?
You mean, janice?

40:08.789 --> 40:12.793
Janice? They were
talking about me?

40:12.793 --> 40:13.794
About your dnr.

40:13.794 --> 40:16.297
'Cause that's what's confusing,

40:16.297 --> 40:18.299
like, dna,
everybody's got that.

40:18.299 --> 40:21.302
She thinks
i should have a dnr?

40:21.302 --> 40:23.804
Or that dad should
give it to you or something.

40:23.804 --> 40:26.807
Because what if you went
into a coma or something?

40:26.807 --> 40:30.811
But dna doesn't
prevent coma's,
does it?

40:30.811 --> 40:35.316
I don't know, i gotta
do this report by monday.

40:41.322 --> 40:44.325
Very good, livia,
that's perfect.

40:44.325 --> 40:46.327
I know my alphabet.

40:46.327 --> 40:47.828
Guess what, ma?

40:47.828 --> 40:50.831
I got great news.

40:50.831 --> 40:54.835
Tony's not gonna
sell the house.

40:54.835 --> 40:59.840
When you get released,
we're gonna take you back home.

40:59.840 --> 41:00.841
Really?

41:00.841 --> 41:02.343
Yeah.

41:02.343 --> 41:04.345
And i'm gonna
live with you.

41:04.345 --> 41:06.347
Why?

41:06.847 --> 41:10.351
So you cannot
resuscitate me?

41:10.351 --> 41:11.852
So i can what?

41:12.353 --> 41:16.357
Oh, i seen that movie
with richard widmark.

41:16.357 --> 41:17.858
Movie, ma?

41:17.858 --> 41:19.360
Oh, mrs. Soprano.

41:19.360 --> 41:20.861
No, take this one.

41:20.861 --> 41:24.865
She gets her ballet shoes,
she sells them

41:24.865 --> 41:26.867
and she takes the money
to newark,

41:26.867 --> 41:29.870
and she buys
amphetamines.

41:30.371 --> 41:32.373
She was
a child then.

41:32.373 --> 41:36.377
I think you should go
live with your daughter,
mrs. Soprano.

41:36.877 --> 41:41.382
I think i'm gonna leave
all my money to you, honey.

41:41.382 --> 41:46.887
What are you
talking about, money?

41:47.388 --> 41:52.393
I've gotta catch up
on some charts.

41:52.393 --> 41:55.896
Janice, what'd
i tell you last week?

41:55.896 --> 41:59.900
Where'd
i put my money?

41:59.900 --> 42:02.903
You know,
this is very important.

42:02.903 --> 42:06.407
I must have
put it somewhere.

42:06.407 --> 42:09.410
Oh, c'mon, settimia.

42:09.410 --> 42:12.913
No, you don't
fool me.

42:12.913 --> 42:15.416
I know what
you're thinking about.

42:15.416 --> 42:16.917
My name's janice.

42:16.917 --> 42:18.919
Janice, ma.

42:18.919 --> 42:20.921
You named me.

42:21.422 --> 42:23.924
It's something else
you threw away of mine.

42:28.929 --> 42:30.931
Are you sure?

42:30.931 --> 42:33.934
I didn't tell you
where i put that money?

42:34.435 --> 42:36.937
Let's not
worry about that.

42:36.937 --> 42:38.939
Let's just
get you better

42:38.939 --> 42:40.941
so you can go home

42:40.941 --> 42:43.944
and i can take
good care of you.

42:43.944 --> 42:45.946
And if it's there...

42:45.946 --> 42:48.449
we'll find it.

43:08.469 --> 43:10.471
Your sister's cunt!

43:21.482 --> 43:23.984
That was wonderful, reverend,
thank you.

43:23.984 --> 43:26.487
Now you call us
if you need anything.

43:26.487 --> 43:27.988
Thank you.

43:27.988 --> 43:29.990
Goodnight.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.002
What's all this?

43:42.002 --> 43:44.505
My father'
s passed away.

43:45.005 --> 43:46.507
I was just
talking to him.

43:46.507 --> 43:48.008
He lived well.

43:48.008 --> 43:50.010
God blessed hi
m with longevity.

43:50.010 --> 43:54.515
What are you gonna do?
We all will have our time.

43:55.015 --> 43:58.519
My father didn't know about
our business arrangement.

43:58.519 --> 44:01.522
He wouldn't
have approved.

44:01.522 --> 44:07.027
Yeah, i got
that feeling.

44:07.027 --> 44:08.529
Your moms and pop
still here?

44:08.529 --> 44:10.531
My old man's
been gone for years.

44:10.531 --> 44:11.532
Moms?

44:12.032 --> 44:15.035
She still around,
she's too miserable to die.

44:15.536 --> 44:18.038
Their generation's
almost all gone.

44:18.038 --> 44:20.541
When the
last one goes,

44:20.541 --> 44:24.044
we become the old folk
s at the family functions.

44:24.044 --> 44:26.046
What are you
talking about?

44:26.547 --> 44:28.048
We're still fucking kids,
for crying out loud.

44:28.549 --> 44:30.050
Don't you
believe it, tony.

44:30.551 --> 44:33.554
When the last one dies,
it signals the beginning
of the last stretch for us.

44:33.554 --> 44:36.557
Don't get me wrong,
i'm not looking to go
no time soon,

44:37.057 --> 44:38.559
it's just...

44:38.559 --> 44:46.066
just feels funny now
being...an elder.

44:54.074 --> 44:58.078
This is your end of
the demonstration bust- up.

44:58.078 --> 45:00.581
Your guys went
a little too far.

45:01.081 --> 45:02.583
Rasheen taylor
almost lost an eye.

45:03.083 --> 45:05.085
How'd you do
overall?

45:05.085 --> 45:08.589
Masserone gave me
five no- shows.

45:08.589 --> 45:10.591
We whack it up
two and a half each.

45:10.591 --> 45:12.092
Three- two.

45:12.092 --> 45:13.594
I should be looking for
three- two my way.

45:13.594 --> 45:16.096
I got to kick upstairs
to uncle junior.

45:16.096 --> 45:17.598
Two and a half each.

45:17.598 --> 45:19.099
All your guys
are in on this shit.

45:19.099 --> 45:22.102
These protesters find out
i'm lining my pockets
with their blood,

45:22.102 --> 45:24.104
it's me
they're crying for.

45:24.104 --> 45:25.606
Hell, no,
three- two.

45:25.606 --> 45:27.608
I'll think about it.

45:27.608 --> 45:31.612
What'd you hear about
the public school
asbestos removal project

45:31.612 --> 45:33.614
over in kearney?

45:33.614 --> 45:36.116
Just waiting to see
who gets the bid.

45:36.617 --> 45:39.620
Alright.

45:39.620 --> 45:42.122
Hey, rev...

45:42.122 --> 45:49.129
sorry about
your old man.

45:53.634 --> 45:57.638
Hello.

45:57.638 --> 45:59.139
He did?

45:59.139 --> 46:00.641
Where is
he now?

46:04.645 --> 46:06.647
Hello?

46:06.647 --> 46:08.148
Oh, you're home.

46:08.148 --> 46:10.150
How dare
you call here.

46:10.150 --> 46:12.653
I called now on purpose.

46:12.653 --> 46:15.155
Because i know
johnny's at work.

46:15.155 --> 46:17.658
Anthony, your son,
anthony.

46:18.158 --> 46:19.660
He harbors resentment
against me

46:20.160 --> 46:23.664
and to this day
i don't know what i did.

46:23.664 --> 46:24.665
I'm hanging up.

46:25.165 --> 46:26.667
I just want
you to know

46:27.167 --> 46:30.170
what pennies i have,
i leave to the children.

46:30.170 --> 46:33.674
Your children
and barbara's children.

46:33.674 --> 46:36.677
I raised three children
of my own.

46:37.177 --> 46:41.181
I did a pretty
good job on two.

46:41.181 --> 46:43.684
They are all unhappy.

46:43.684 --> 46:46.186
Sure, you listen
to that janice.

46:46.687 --> 46:48.188
Be very careful,

46:48.188 --> 46:50.691
because she's a real
snake in the grass.

46:51.191 --> 46:53.694
She has no work ethic,
why is that?

46:53.694 --> 46:57.197
If anything
happens to me...

46:57.197 --> 46:58.699
hello?

46:58.699 --> 47:00.701
Hello?

47:01.201 --> 47:05.205
Oh.

47:08.709 --> 47:10.210
Where is he?

47:10.210 --> 47:11.712
Did you
call an ambulance?

47:11.712 --> 47:13.714
I don't need
no fucking ambulance.

47:14.214 --> 47:17.718
See?

47:17.718 --> 47:19.720
Oh, yeah, sure,
look at you.

47:19.720 --> 47:21.722
C'mon, we're going
to the emergency room.

47:21.722 --> 47:23.724
Fuck that,
i'm alright.

47:23.724 --> 47:31.231
Why don't we just
go down there and make sure?

47:31.231 --> 47:32.733
Uncle jun.

47:38.739 --> 47:40.741
Hey...

47:40.741 --> 47:42.743
you still here?

47:42.743 --> 47:44.745
No fucking ambulance.

47:44.745 --> 47:49.249
I'll drive you, okay?
Bacala will come.

47:49.249 --> 47:50.751
Yeah, sure.

47:50.751 --> 47:52.252
We'll all go.

47:52.252 --> 47:55.255
Help me up.

47:55.255 --> 47:56.757
Can you walk?

47:56.757 --> 47:59.259
I think
he broke his hip.

47:59.259 --> 48:00.761
Oh, fuck you.

48:00.761 --> 48:02.763
Take it easy,
hold on a minute.

48:02.763 --> 48:04.264
I'll be okay.

48:04.264 --> 48:06.767
Give me a minute
to catch my breath.

48:13.774 --> 48:16.276
Alright.

48:16.276 --> 48:17.778
What are you doing?

48:17.778 --> 48:21.782
What, do you
want a piggy- back?

48:21.782 --> 48:23.283
Get the door.

48:23.784 --> 48:25.285
Anthony...

48:25.285 --> 48:27.788
don't let me go to my grave
with this guilt.

48:27.788 --> 48:29.790
You listen to me,
you old prick,

48:29.790 --> 48:31.792
you're not
going anywhere.

48:31.792 --> 48:38.298
Make things right
with your mother, please.
