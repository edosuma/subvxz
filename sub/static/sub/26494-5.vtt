00:01.334 --> 00:03.101
- Maggie.
- My father,

00:03.103 --> 00:04.736
he's gonna bring Maggie
back to life.

00:06.273 --> 00:08.574
Maggie? Hey, sorry.

00:08.576 --> 00:11.009
- You okay?
- I'm alive, so...

00:11.745 --> 00:12.911
yes?

00:15.452 --> 00:18.120
Remember when you asked

00:18.122 --> 00:19.688
if we could stop it?

00:20.724 --> 00:22.290
All the evil
in the world?

00:28.132 --> 00:30.265
Well, maybe with Jack,
we can.

00:36.140 --> 00:37.405
Maybe you're right.

00:37.407 --> 00:40.342
But then
what will we do?

00:40.344 --> 00:41.977
Dean?

00:41.979 --> 00:44.146
We had a deal!

00:46.450 --> 00:47.582
Michael.

00:47.584 --> 00:49.050
Thanks for the suit.

00:49.052 --> 00:50.886
I appreciate you
accepting my invitation.

00:50.888 --> 00:53.855
I'm the leader
of a werewolf pack.

00:53.857 --> 00:56.057
Why on Earth would an archangel
care about us?

00:56.059 --> 00:58.593
- Isn't it time you had your due?
- Our due?

00:58.595 --> 01:01.229
There are ways
to enhance your...

01:01.231 --> 01:03.064
let's call them
talents.

01:03.066 --> 01:05.266
And these ways are...

01:05.269 --> 01:07.302
Fully tested.

01:07.304 --> 01:09.738
Yes.

01:13.744 --> 01:16.845
There were some misfires early.
I will admit to that.

01:16.847 --> 01:19.314
But I have
cracked the code.

01:19.316 --> 01:21.950
Do you propose we wage a war
on the humans?

01:21.952 --> 01:23.885
Why be the hunted...

01:23.887 --> 01:25.854
when you can be
the hunter?

02:16.139 --> 02:17.239
Hey, guys.

02:17.241 --> 02:19.674
Okay, so here we are

02:19.676 --> 02:22.310
in delightful
Claremore, Oklahoma.

02:24.014 --> 02:27.015
According to the post,
that's where it came from.

02:27.017 --> 02:29.851
I'm thinking ghoul.

02:29.853 --> 02:31.319
Anyway...

02:33.056 --> 02:34.723
...here we go.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.987
I know homework sucks,
but it get it down --

03:38.989 --> 03:40.388
all of it.

03:40.390 --> 03:43.625
The more we know,
the better we are, so...

03:46.930 --> 03:48.463
Uh...

03:50.500 --> 03:52.901
Everybody good?
Any questions?

03:52.903 --> 03:56.438
Okay.
Let's get to work.

03:56.440 --> 03:58.106
You kids
have fun out there.

04:00.344 --> 04:03.311
- Don't even say it. - What?
- No, it's good.

04:03.313 --> 04:05.180
It's got, like, a very
camp-counselor vibe to it.

04:05.182 --> 04:07.449
Just need
to get you a whistle.

04:07.451 --> 04:09.017
What is that?

04:09.019 --> 04:11.586
It's nothing. It's just...

04:11.588 --> 04:12.921
Hunter check-ins.

04:12.923 --> 04:14.456
- Check-ins?
- Yeah.

04:14.458 --> 04:16.291
That's adorable.

04:20.863 --> 04:23.765
You got any rest lately,
like at all?

04:24.935 --> 04:27.402
I mean, look, man, I know things
are crazy right now, okay?

04:27.404 --> 04:28.770
I mean, hell, I just
went toe-to-toe

04:28.772 --> 04:30.972
with my own personal
horror-movie icon,

04:30.974 --> 04:32.216
but we all need
our beauty sleep.

04:32.217 --> 04:34.142
Dean, I have 16 Hunters
on cases right now.

04:34.144 --> 04:35.910
That's not counting Jack
and Cass in Sarasota

04:35.912 --> 04:38.213
or Mom and Bobby working
that rugaru in Texas.

04:38.215 --> 04:40.882
Okay, you know that these people
survived a war, right?

04:40.884 --> 04:42.884
Yeah, but a war
isn't Hunting.

04:42.886 --> 04:47.622
These people need, uh, lore
and weapons and tips

04:47.624 --> 04:49.290
and backup, and --

04:49.292 --> 04:51.693
Look, don't worry
about me, all right?

04:51.695 --> 04:53.294
I'm -- I'm --
I'm good.

04:54.798 --> 04:56.064
What is it?

04:56.066 --> 04:58.633
One of the Hunters,
uh, missed check-in.

04:58.635 --> 04:59.968
Who?

04:59.970 --> 05:01.469
Maggie.

05:10.013 --> 05:12.013
Come on, kid,
answer the phone.

05:17.053 --> 05:18.520
You got them
wearing body cams now?

05:18.522 --> 05:20.021
Yeah, they're new.

05:20.023 --> 05:22.290
I figured watching each other
Hunt is the best way to learn.

05:22.292 --> 05:25.160
<i>- Okay, so --</i>
- They upload directly to the server.

05:25.162 --> 05:28.229
<i>...in delightful</i>
<i>Claremore, Oklahoma.</i>

05:28.231 --> 05:29.864
And if something
goes wrong,

05:29.866 --> 05:32.133
you got
a place to start.

05:32.135 --> 05:34.769
Yeah. That, too.

05:34.771 --> 05:36.137
<i>Here we go.</i>

05:48.084 --> 05:50.218
Something jumped her.

05:54.057 --> 05:55.657
The ghoul?

05:55.659 --> 05:56.991
Dean, if she's hurt
or dead --

05:56.993 --> 05:58.193
We don't know
that, okay?

05:58.195 --> 05:59.928
We don't know
anything yet.

06:01.631 --> 06:03.164
You just watched
the same thing I did.

06:03.166 --> 06:04.499
I saw a ghoul, okay?

06:04.501 --> 06:06.167
And, yeah, they're nasty
little sons of bitches,

06:06.169 --> 06:07.902
but they're
also scavengers.

06:07.904 --> 06:09.404
They don't usually
feed on the living.

06:09.406 --> 06:12.140
- Yeah, so why attack her?
- I don't know.

06:12.142 --> 06:13.641
But I bet if we go there
and find out,

06:13.643 --> 06:15.210
we got a shot
at bringing her home.

06:26.756 --> 06:29.624
- So, what's the deal here?
- I don't know.

06:29.626 --> 06:31.860
- Same family owns the whole place.
- Huh.

06:31.862 --> 06:33.995
Private cemetery.
Must be nice.

06:33.997 --> 06:36.130
- What?
- As in convenient.

06:36.132 --> 06:37.599
But what are we talking here?
Are they some sort of

06:37.601 --> 06:39.534
weirdo shut-ins
like the Addams Family?

06:39.536 --> 06:41.569
Uh, Maggie
was working a lead.

06:41.571 --> 06:43.371
Kids online said
they were studying when --

06:43.373 --> 06:45.406
and I quote -- "a walker
tried to end them."

06:45.408 --> 06:46.908
It's a zombie --
a "Walking Dead" thing.

06:46.910 --> 06:49.410
I know what
a walker is, Sam.

06:49.412 --> 06:51.179
- "Studying," huh?
- Yeah.

07:20.243 --> 07:21.943
Hey,
check it out.

07:23.947 --> 07:25.980
Drag marks.

07:25.982 --> 07:27.582
But no blood,

07:27.584 --> 07:30.418
which means Maggie
could still be alive.

07:30.420 --> 07:31.920
Ghouls don't
take prisoners.

07:31.922 --> 07:34.222
Okay, say that
she surprised it,

07:34.224 --> 07:36.090
it attacked,

07:36.092 --> 07:41.462
and then took her somewhere
to feed for later, right?

07:41.464 --> 07:43.731
Maybe it didn't
finish the job yet.

07:43.733 --> 07:45.700
Either way,
I say we find it --

07:45.702 --> 07:47.635
- And kill it.
- Yeah.

07:47.637 --> 07:50.638
Hello?
Who's down there?

07:54.844 --> 07:56.377
All right,
we're coming up.

07:56.379 --> 07:57.712
Hey!

07:57.714 --> 07:59.213
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

07:59.215 --> 08:01.149
Yeah. I'm -- I'm Mr. Harrison.
This is Mr. Byrne.

08:01.151 --> 08:03.518
We're with the
Historic Preservation Society.

08:03.520 --> 08:04.919
This is
private property.

08:04.921 --> 08:06.354
Sure. Uh,
the city sent us.

08:06.356 --> 08:08.456
They -- They are gonna
make this whole place

08:08.458 --> 08:10.692
a historic site.
- Yeah. Yeah.

08:10.694 --> 08:12.293
We just need to take
a look around, uh,

08:12.295 --> 08:14.996
survey the grounds,
and then the home.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.499
I-If we could just
speak with the owner.

08:18.501 --> 08:20.201
Hm.

08:22.772 --> 08:24.505
Follow me.

08:26.576 --> 08:28.309
I knew it!
I always said

08:28.311 --> 08:30.278
this place had
historical significance.

08:30.280 --> 08:32.347
- So much significance.
- Thought so.

08:32.349 --> 08:34.349
Oh, please.

08:34.351 --> 08:36.049
I'm no expert.

08:36.052 --> 08:38.119
I do subscribe
to <i>Architectural Digest.</i>

08:38.121 --> 08:40.288
Oh, is that right?

08:40.289 --> 08:42.823
The thing is...

08:42.826 --> 08:44.859
...how many of you
does this take?

08:44.861 --> 08:47.528
I mean, two of you
seems like enough.

08:47.530 --> 08:49.864
Two of us?

08:49.866 --> 08:51.199
Your colleagues?

08:51.201 --> 08:53.101
Well, they got here
right before you did --

08:53.103 --> 08:54.969
said they were
from the H.P.S., too.

08:54.971 --> 08:56.771
Really?
Y--

09:01.544 --> 09:04.012
You gotta
be kidding me.

09:04.014 --> 09:06.047
Hello, boys.

09:07.450 --> 09:09.017
What are you
doing here?

09:09.019 --> 09:11.285
Oh, no.
Was there a mix-up?

09:11.287 --> 09:12.553
No. Not at all.

09:12.555 --> 09:13.755
We --
W-We're all good.

09:13.757 --> 09:15.490
We, uh, just wish

09:15.492 --> 09:18.192
you'd checked in
with the main office

09:18.194 --> 09:20.228
before coming
all the way out here.

09:20.230 --> 09:21.896
Well, we don't
need permission

09:21.898 --> 09:23.431
to look at houses.

09:23.433 --> 09:26.134
Especially
when the main office

09:26.136 --> 09:28.736
is run by a bunch
of idjits.

09:32.175 --> 09:33.808
I really hope this won't
affect our chances

09:33.810 --> 09:36.044
of being
historically preserved.

09:36.046 --> 09:38.479
Could you just
give us a minute?

09:42.585 --> 09:45.453
So, uh, Neil, right?

09:45.455 --> 09:48.189
How long is the house
been in your family?

09:48.191 --> 09:49.924
Oh. No.

09:49.926 --> 09:51.626
I can see why
you think that.

09:51.628 --> 09:52.927
I'm...I'm flattered.

09:52.929 --> 09:54.662
I'm not the owner.

09:54.664 --> 09:56.197
Oh, that'd be
Mr. Rawling.

09:56.199 --> 09:58.099
I'm his nurse.

09:58.101 --> 09:59.434
Oh.

10:00.937 --> 10:03.705
We're gonna need
to talk to him.

10:03.707 --> 10:05.540
Mm.

10:05.542 --> 10:07.175
It was
her first solo Hunt,

10:07.177 --> 10:10.812
and she was
nervous, excited.

10:10.814 --> 10:12.547
Bobby and I were talking her
through it,

10:12.549 --> 10:14.615
giving her pointers,
and then all of a sudden,

10:14.617 --> 10:16.084
she just
stopped texting.

10:16.086 --> 10:18.486
We were worried,
but we should have called.

10:18.488 --> 10:21.289
No, it's...

10:21.291 --> 10:23.257
Did you
find anything?

10:23.259 --> 10:26.094
Mr. Harrison, a word.

10:34.704 --> 10:36.537
Is it just me or
does this guy look exactly --

10:36.539 --> 10:38.706
No, that's him,
from the video.

10:39.809 --> 10:42.143
So, if he's here,
where's Maggie?

10:43.313 --> 10:45.113
Help me.

10:54.491 --> 10:55.923
Somebody...

10:55.925 --> 10:57.425
ple--

10:57.427 --> 10:59.093
Help me.

11:07.701 --> 11:10.034
Mr. Rawling.

11:10.036 --> 11:11.769
Groundskeeper found him
like this.

11:11.771 --> 11:13.304
He had a stroke.

11:13.306 --> 11:14.806
I'm doing my best to keep him
comfortable, but --

11:14.808 --> 11:17.542
Neil?
Give me a hand?

11:17.544 --> 11:18.877
In here!

11:18.879 --> 11:21.546
Sasha --
Mr. Rawling's daughter.

11:24.718 --> 11:26.251
Sasha,
they're from

11:26.253 --> 11:28.553
the National Historic
Preservation Society.

11:28.555 --> 11:30.021
Isn't that exciting?

11:33.059 --> 11:34.459
What?

11:36.163 --> 11:37.529
<i>This</i> house?

11:37.531 --> 11:38.730
You're sure?

11:38.732 --> 11:41.132
Yeah, she's, uh...
she's got good bones.

11:41.134 --> 11:43.401
Ah. My grandpa
used to say that

11:43.403 --> 11:45.837
when he and my grandma
lived here.

11:45.839 --> 11:48.940
Now, your father -- how long
has he lived here?

11:48.942 --> 11:51.476
Full-time?

11:51.478 --> 11:52.944
I don't really know.

11:52.946 --> 11:55.413
- You don't know?
- Look, I just came down here

11:55.415 --> 11:57.148
to get everything
in order before he...

11:58.385 --> 12:00.051
Well, before he dies.

12:01.121 --> 12:04.622
Look, it's -- it's been
a really long week.

12:04.624 --> 12:06.658
Sure. Sorry, um...

12:06.660 --> 12:08.259
We'll just take a second,
and we'll be out of your hair.

12:08.261 --> 12:10.094
You know what?
I can't. Not today.

12:10.096 --> 12:12.997
So, I'm sorry.
You're gonna have to leave.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.067
Well, it ain't
a ghoul.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.690
I checked the old guy out
pretty good back there -- no bites.

12:18.740 --> 12:20.004
Maybe we're looking
at a shifter.

12:20.006 --> 12:21.806
I don't know.
Shifters don't usually

12:21.808 --> 12:24.175
hang out in graveyards.
- Maybe he was possessed,

12:24.177 --> 12:27.845
you know, or maybe a demon
took his body for a joyride?

12:27.847 --> 12:29.314
Yeah,
and then what?

12:29.316 --> 12:30.648
He tucks him
back in

12:30.650 --> 12:33.351
like he's returning
a library book?

12:33.353 --> 12:35.086
Anyways, I spritzed him
with holy water

12:35.088 --> 12:36.888
when the nurse's head
was turned.

12:36.890 --> 12:40.024
This case obviously
ain't a milk run.

12:40.026 --> 12:41.392
Something on
your mind, Bobby?

12:41.394 --> 12:43.127
Yeah.
Your brother.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.563
He let Maggie come here

12:45.565 --> 12:48.166
when she had no idea what
she was walking into.

12:50.036 --> 12:52.670
She wasn't ready.

12:52.672 --> 12:54.839
Oh, c'mon, when is
anybody ever ready?

12:54.841 --> 12:56.374
You are or you ain't.

12:56.376 --> 12:59.310
A real leader would've
seen that a mile a way.

12:59.312 --> 13:00.878
Bobby.

13:02.816 --> 13:05.450
Look, we all want
the same thing.

13:05.452 --> 13:08.386
We -- We have a job to do,
so let's do it.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.089
Sam,
you're with me.

13:11.091 --> 13:13.157
Bobby,
you're with Dean.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.465
Look, don't listen
to Bobby.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.267
Um, maybe he's right,
you know?

13:22.269 --> 13:24.869
I encouraged her.
Maybe he's right about me,

13:24.871 --> 13:26.170
about everything.

13:26.172 --> 13:27.472
Sam.

13:29.342 --> 13:31.909
Watching you
these last few weeks,

13:31.911 --> 13:34.212
you know what I've been
saying to myself?

13:34.214 --> 13:36.347
"This is what
he was born to do."

13:37.751 --> 13:40.652
If Bobby can't
see that, then...

13:40.654 --> 13:42.854
it's not the only thing
he's been missing lately.

13:44.224 --> 13:45.657
I wasn't
gonna mention it.

13:45.659 --> 13:47.458
None of my business,
but it did seem like

13:47.460 --> 13:50.695
you'd gotten
pretty close lately.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.497
Yeah, and
I thought so, too.

13:52.499 --> 13:55.566
Maybe, but since
we've been back,

13:55.568 --> 13:57.735
things have changed.

13:57.737 --> 13:59.671
Changed how?

13:59.673 --> 14:01.539
We're Hunting
all the time.

14:01.541 --> 14:04.575
He won't take a break,
not even for a second.

14:04.577 --> 14:07.045
There's something
on his mind, and...

14:07.047 --> 14:09.113
he doesn't want
to talk about it.

14:09.115 --> 14:10.748
Have you asked?

14:10.750 --> 14:12.850
Bobby's not open
like your dad.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.185
Wait.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.420
Like <i>my</i> dad?

14:16.690 --> 14:18.022
Okay.

14:18.024 --> 14:20.858
At least he's not like
your dad was when I knew him.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.494
Right.

14:23.496 --> 14:26.297
Bobby's got walls,
big ones.

14:26.299 --> 14:29.567
I just don't know
if I can do that...

14:29.569 --> 14:31.936
if I even ever put myself
out there again.

14:34.708 --> 14:37.408
I shouldn't be talking
to you about this.

14:43.183 --> 14:46.918
You think I was too hard
on your brother back there.

14:46.920 --> 14:49.754
He's doing his best.
He's doing better than his best.

14:49.756 --> 14:51.589
You know, this whole
Hunter Five-O thing --

14:51.591 --> 14:53.358
he's -- he's killing
himself over it.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.026
He doesn't eat,
he doesn't sleep,

14:55.028 --> 14:56.928
grew himself one of those
Kenny Rogers Beards.

14:56.930 --> 14:58.629
No offense.

14:58.631 --> 15:01.199
Well, I'm, uh...

15:01.201 --> 15:03.568
still getting
to know this Bobby.

15:03.570 --> 15:07.305
Um, our Bobby wasn't
the most open person either.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.907
Not at first.

15:09.909 --> 15:13.311
His wife, she, uh --
she was possessed by a demon,

15:13.313 --> 15:16.180
and he had to
take care of it himself.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.618
They never had
any children?

15:20.620 --> 15:22.487
No.

15:22.489 --> 15:23.988
Anyway, point is,

15:23.990 --> 15:25.923
people put up walls
for a reason.

15:25.925 --> 15:29.327
So, whatever your Bobby
has behind his...

15:30.897 --> 15:32.330
...doubt it's pretty.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.435
But you think
I should try and find out?

15:37.437 --> 15:38.770
You know what?

15:39.773 --> 15:42.206
If you care
about him,

15:42.208 --> 15:44.208
I think
you should.

15:48.314 --> 15:50.281
- Hey, what is...?
- What?

15:50.283 --> 15:52.784
Sam, look at this.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.963
FBI,

16:38.965 --> 16:40.832
DEA...

16:42.602 --> 16:44.101
...Forest Service.

16:50.877 --> 16:53.544
Looks like
a Hunter's wallet.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.980
Another Hunter?

16:55.982 --> 16:57.515
Not one of ours.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.223
Bobby?

17:09.229 --> 17:10.694
Bobby!

17:22.608 --> 17:24.040
The hell?

17:32.318 --> 17:33.985
What happened
to you?!

17:34.954 --> 17:38.055
I could ask you
the same question.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.390
Y--

18:15.228 --> 18:17.662
Hello?

18:17.664 --> 18:19.163
Neil?

18:41.354 --> 18:42.787
No! No!

19:03.873 --> 19:06.307
A thing chased me
down the hall.

19:06.309 --> 19:07.942
What kind
of thing?

19:07.944 --> 19:10.178
It couldn't have been real.
It looked --

19:10.180 --> 19:11.812
It looked
like a vampire.

19:11.814 --> 19:14.081
Oh, I'm crazy.
That sounded crazy.

19:15.852 --> 19:17.652
You're not crazy.

19:20.023 --> 19:21.122
I'm sorry.

19:21.124 --> 19:23.724
What are you
doing in my house?

19:27.463 --> 19:29.564
You hunt monsters?

19:30.500 --> 19:31.999
What about
the Historic Society?

19:32.001 --> 19:34.368
Uh, yeah -- Sorry.

19:35.905 --> 19:38.172
You're not gonna believe
what I found in the shed.

19:38.174 --> 19:39.974
You <i>hunt</i>
monsters?

19:39.976 --> 19:41.642
Oh, good.
You told them.

19:41.644 --> 19:43.177
What did you
find in the shed?

19:43.179 --> 19:44.545
Dead guy.

19:46.482 --> 19:49.717
Any chance, uh --
Any chance it was him?

19:51.087 --> 19:53.187
Yeah.
Yeah, that's him.

19:53.189 --> 19:54.455
Great.

19:54.457 --> 19:57.558
So, we think something
is killing Hunters.

19:59.095 --> 20:00.561
Where's Bobby?

20:00.563 --> 20:03.197
Said he had to grab something
out of the truck.

20:03.199 --> 20:05.499
I'll go check.

20:05.501 --> 20:06.667
No, wait,
time out.

20:06.669 --> 20:08.703
There's a dead body
on our property?

20:08.705 --> 20:11.138
Yeah, that's not all.

20:11.140 --> 20:13.774
A wormy clone of her dad
tried to kill me.

20:13.776 --> 20:15.943
It was the same thing that
attacked Maggie in the video.

20:15.945 --> 20:18.579
- W-Who's Maggie?
- But my dad is right there.

20:18.581 --> 20:20.314
This makes no sense.

20:20.316 --> 20:22.583
Sasha, c-can we talk to
the Groundskeeper, please?

20:22.585 --> 20:24.719
Don?
He left hours ago.

20:24.721 --> 20:27.455
What about
the thing that I saw?

20:27.457 --> 20:29.190
Right. Yep.
S-So, she had

20:29.192 --> 20:31.726
a vampire chase her
down the hall.

20:33.329 --> 20:35.396
Okay, you're right --
no sense.

20:35.398 --> 20:38.099
I mean, what kind of vampire
lets its dinner go AWOL?

20:38.101 --> 20:40.468
And that thing that I killed
died weird.

20:40.470 --> 20:41.936
Okay, you know what?
This is a stretch, but --

20:41.938 --> 20:44.038
but go with me.
What if what we're dealing with,

20:44.040 --> 20:46.274
what if they aren't
monsters at all?

20:46.276 --> 20:48.142
Oh, thank God.

20:48.144 --> 20:50.077
All right.
Well, then what are they?

20:50.079 --> 20:51.846
Maybe some kind of
manifestation?

20:51.848 --> 20:53.948
Like from a witch
or a psychic?

20:53.950 --> 20:56.584
Remember, uh, the -- the guy
in the old folks' home?

20:56.586 --> 20:58.452
He could -- He could make things
go "Looney Tunes."

20:58.454 --> 21:00.107
Fred Jones --
Yeah, Dad's buddy.

21:00.131 --> 21:00.656
Exactly.

21:00.657 --> 21:02.590
He was psychokinetic.
He could reshape reality.

21:02.592 --> 21:05.359
Reshape?
That's not possible.

21:05.361 --> 21:07.795
Oh, pal, you have no idea
what's possible.

21:07.797 --> 21:09.563
Yeah, but Fred Jones
was damn near catatonic.

21:09.565 --> 21:10.965
He had no idea
what he was doing.

21:10.967 --> 21:12.566
Well, maybe
he doesn't either.

21:12.568 --> 21:14.468
You think
my dad's doing this?

21:14.470 --> 21:17.438
Sasha, has your dad ever shown
any signs of, um...

21:17.440 --> 21:20.474
Psychic powers?
There's -- No. No.

21:20.476 --> 21:22.743
I mean, if we're talking
textbook workaholic

21:22.745 --> 21:24.278
with toxic narcissistic
tendencies,

21:24.280 --> 21:27.181
then, yeah, sure, maybe.
But a psychic? No way.

21:27.183 --> 21:30.251
Why would he manifest a vampire
to scare his own daughter?

21:31.654 --> 21:33.487
Sasha, tell us exactly
what was going on

21:33.489 --> 21:35.189
when you saw
the vampire.

21:35.191 --> 21:37.191
I thought I heard rats

21:37.193 --> 21:38.626
or something
in the attic.

21:38.628 --> 21:40.394
I was going up to see,
but I --

21:40.396 --> 21:41.962
But you got scared.

21:41.964 --> 21:43.964
You got scared,
so you didn't go.

21:46.269 --> 21:47.368
- The attic.
- Yeah.

21:47.370 --> 21:49.070
I'll go.
You stay with them.

21:59.349 --> 22:01.315
Bobby!

22:12.362 --> 22:14.228
Bobby!

22:34.884 --> 22:36.450
Could you not --

22:38.621 --> 22:40.621
Yeah, you know what?
Never mind.

22:43.926 --> 22:46.927
- You okay?
- Well, my father's dying,

22:46.929 --> 22:49.363
and there's a strange man
sharpening a...

22:50.166 --> 22:53.267
...machete to presumably
kill monsters with

22:53.269 --> 22:54.769
in my living room.

22:54.771 --> 22:56.437
Thank God
for benzos.

22:59.208 --> 23:01.542
I never should
have come back here.

23:01.544 --> 23:04.178
Thanks, Dad.

23:04.180 --> 23:06.147
No love lost
between you two, huh?

23:10.019 --> 23:11.485
- Look, I get it.
-No offense,

23:11.487 --> 23:13.687
but I'm not really up
for a heart-to-heart.

23:15.057 --> 23:16.891
Great. Okay.

23:20.930 --> 23:24.265
My dad wasn't
the best person.

23:24.267 --> 23:26.233
He was gone all
the time working

23:26.235 --> 23:27.935
for us,
he said, but...

23:29.071 --> 23:30.704
...my mom...

23:32.375 --> 23:35.609
He knew depression
runs in her family.

23:35.611 --> 23:39.046
He wasn't there, so I was
the one who found her.

23:39.048 --> 23:40.748
I was 12.

23:44.821 --> 23:46.320
I'm sorry.

23:46.322 --> 23:48.722
Mm.

23:48.724 --> 23:50.424
That's what
everyone says.

23:50.426 --> 23:52.460
Except him.

23:52.462 --> 23:54.228
Never said it.

23:56.032 --> 23:59.200
You want to know what
the most ridiculous part is?

23:59.202 --> 24:02.269
I worshipped him
when I was kid.

24:02.271 --> 24:04.405
Didn't know any better.

24:04.407 --> 24:06.507
He's the only family
I have left.

24:12.114 --> 24:13.914
Can I give you
a little advice?

24:18.154 --> 24:19.553
Let it go.

24:22.892 --> 24:24.792
The past is...

24:25.962 --> 24:28.162
There's nothing
you can do about it now,

24:28.164 --> 24:32.066
so...it's just baggage.

24:32.068 --> 24:34.568
Let it go.
You'll feel a lot lighter.

24:35.638 --> 24:38.506
Is that
what you do?

24:39.842 --> 24:43.043
I try.

24:43.045 --> 24:44.478
Every single day.

25:50.947 --> 25:52.546
Maggie.

25:55.751 --> 25:56.884
Oh, no.

25:56.886 --> 25:57.952
Okay.

26:03.593 --> 26:05.693
- Sam?
- Hey.

26:05.695 --> 26:07.027
- It's here.
- What?

26:07.029 --> 26:08.629
It's here.

26:08.631 --> 26:10.431
It's -- It's here.

26:23.980 --> 26:26.080
I-I didn't mean
to get caught. I'm s--

26:26.082 --> 26:27.648
No, no, no. Stop that.

26:27.650 --> 26:28.949
Maggie,

26:28.951 --> 26:30.718
you did nothing wrong,
all right?

26:30.720 --> 26:31.919
We're gonna
get you home, okay?

26:31.921 --> 26:33.354
We're gonna get you
out of here.

26:51.273 --> 26:53.140
Daniel?

26:53.142 --> 26:54.775
Hey, Dad.

27:02.318 --> 27:04.351
Daniel...

27:04.353 --> 27:05.719
you can't be --

27:05.721 --> 27:07.087
What?

27:07.089 --> 27:09.123
Here? Real?

27:09.125 --> 27:11.325
But here I am.

27:15.331 --> 27:18.132
And, damn,
this feels real good.

27:36.218 --> 27:38.318
Aah!

27:38.320 --> 27:40.854
C'mon, Dad.

27:40.856 --> 27:42.890
I know you're curious --

27:42.892 --> 27:46.126
what they did,
what <i>you</i> let them do.

27:46.128 --> 27:48.595
It's kind of
a funny story.

27:48.597 --> 27:50.864
They crucified me,

27:50.866 --> 27:53.267
piece by piece.

27:53.269 --> 27:55.102
Stop!

27:55.104 --> 27:56.637
Get away from him.

27:56.639 --> 27:58.172
Mary, run!

28:04.280 --> 28:06.313
Aah!

28:24.533 --> 28:26.734
No!

28:26.736 --> 28:28.368
Aah!

28:44.620 --> 28:47.554
I'm sorry.

29:15.662 --> 29:18.062
You're giving him
a transfusion?

29:18.064 --> 29:20.832
Oh. Um...

29:20.834 --> 29:22.967
keeps up his iron.
- Ah.

29:25.638 --> 29:27.305
Sasha,

29:27.307 --> 29:30.108
could you go
make me a sandwich?

29:31.578 --> 29:32.810
Seriously?

29:32.812 --> 29:34.779
You want me to make you
a sandwich?

29:42.689 --> 29:45.423
I'll just go
make that sandwich.

29:45.425 --> 29:46.624
Great.

29:53.032 --> 29:55.133
Wh-What are you
doing?

29:55.135 --> 29:57.468
It didn't hit me
at first,

29:57.470 --> 29:59.570
but then
I remembered --

29:59.572 --> 30:01.906
I've seen
that rig before,

30:01.908 --> 30:03.674
long time ago,

30:03.676 --> 30:05.309
when I was
hooked up to it.

30:09.215 --> 30:11.415
You're not
giving him blood.

30:11.417 --> 30:12.850
You're taking it.

30:14.687 --> 30:16.954
You're a djinn.

30:16.956 --> 30:19.457
But you knew that
already...

30:19.459 --> 30:22.126
didn't you?

30:22.128 --> 30:24.328
Why are you
going after Hunters?

30:24.330 --> 30:26.364
Because
you told me to.

30:29.869 --> 30:31.536
Is this still
part of the game?

30:31.538 --> 30:33.704
- What game?
- The test.

30:36.109 --> 30:38.342
Michael.

30:38.344 --> 30:40.511
You think I'm Michael.

30:40.513 --> 30:42.046
You're not?

30:42.048 --> 30:44.982
No, not anymore.

30:44.984 --> 30:46.350
Hmm...

30:46.352 --> 30:48.352
I thought when you showed up
with that ridiculous

30:48.354 --> 30:51.656
"Historic Society" story
that you --

30:51.658 --> 30:54.392
<i>he</i> was testing me,

30:54.394 --> 30:56.561
making sure I kept up
my end of the bargain.

30:56.563 --> 30:59.330
- What bargain?
- Stop!

30:59.332 --> 31:02.300
Find somewhere quiet,
set up shop,

31:02.302 --> 31:04.101
kill as many Hunters
as I can.

31:04.103 --> 31:06.904
And in return,
he'd give you an upgrade.

31:06.906 --> 31:08.506
It's what he does.

31:09.943 --> 31:12.143
Djinn --

31:12.145 --> 31:14.445
What powers
do we really have?

31:14.447 --> 31:15.746
Trapping our little flies,

31:15.748 --> 31:18.416
weaving our poisonous webs
inside people's minds.

31:18.418 --> 31:20.685
It's all so...limiting.

31:21.888 --> 31:24.055
Now, one touch --

31:24.057 --> 31:27.358
I read minds,
see nightmares.

31:27.360 --> 31:29.894
And because of him,

31:29.896 --> 31:32.163
because of <i>you,</i>

31:32.165 --> 31:35.366
I can bring those nightmares
into the world --

31:35.368 --> 31:38.669
make them do
whatever I want.

31:38.671 --> 31:40.404
The old man?

31:40.406 --> 31:42.440
Rawling?

31:42.442 --> 31:45.076
His worst nightmare is dying
in this house --

31:45.078 --> 31:47.345
unmourned, unloved,

31:47.347 --> 31:49.347
rotting away
in the family crypt,

31:49.349 --> 31:51.549
alone with
his own regret.

31:51.551 --> 31:54.418
It's a tad macabre,
don't you think?

31:54.420 --> 31:57.054
Now, your little
Hunter girl?

31:57.056 --> 32:00.591
Hers were
much more interesting.

32:00.593 --> 32:03.628
It's a shame what those vampires
did to her family.

32:03.630 --> 32:05.663
Quite a place
she comes from,

32:05.665 --> 32:07.531
and your friend
Bobby.

32:08.835 --> 32:12.470
The things slithering
around in his mind.

32:12.472 --> 32:13.971
Ooh.

32:13.973 --> 32:16.240
I said stop.

32:16.242 --> 32:19.210
We both know that
won't do me any harm.

32:19.212 --> 32:23.080
And I highly doubt you have
a knife dipped in lamb's blood.

32:23.082 --> 32:24.949
No, but
it'll slow you down.

32:28.421 --> 32:29.820
Ow!

32:35.361 --> 32:36.861
Relax.

32:36.863 --> 32:38.229
I won't let anything happen

32:38.231 --> 32:40.031
to Michael's
favorite monkey suit,

32:40.033 --> 32:41.899
but I am curious...

32:41.901 --> 32:44.101
what are your nightmares?

32:55.014 --> 32:57.415
You -- You're --

32:59.886 --> 33:02.520
You know, I don't have a blade
dipped in lamb's blood...

33:04.424 --> 33:06.424
...but I can improvise.

33:15.835 --> 33:18.869
You think
I'm the only one,

33:18.871 --> 33:21.072
the only trap?

33:21.074 --> 33:23.374
He made dozens of us,

33:23.376 --> 33:26.744
just out there
waiting for you

33:26.746 --> 33:29.647
and your family.

33:29.649 --> 33:31.449
You don't know
my family.

33:59.510 --> 34:01.711
So, that's all?

34:02.847 --> 34:04.280
Yeah.

34:04.282 --> 34:06.782
The djinn's poison
was keeping him under.

34:06.784 --> 34:08.884
Give him some time.
He'll come back around.

34:10.254 --> 34:11.487
Might even
get that apology.

34:11.489 --> 34:13.456
Yeah, maybe.

34:14.525 --> 34:18.327
Maybe not, but can't change
the past, right?

34:26.371 --> 34:28.704
Oh.
It's okay, Dad.

34:30.108 --> 34:31.641
I'm here.

35:04.142 --> 35:05.775
Hey.

35:05.777 --> 35:07.943
- Hey!
- How you doing?

35:07.945 --> 35:09.412
- You all right?
- You're back.

35:09.414 --> 35:12.548
- So great to see you.
- Bring it here.

35:12.550 --> 35:14.450
You did this.

35:17.121 --> 35:18.487
You got her home.

35:22.727 --> 35:25.161
So, Bobby,

35:25.163 --> 35:26.862
back there --

35:26.864 --> 35:30.032
You weren't supposed
to see that.

35:30.034 --> 35:33.736
Caught sight of him in the woods
when I was with Dean.

35:33.738 --> 35:35.871
I wanted
to handle it myself.

35:37.475 --> 35:39.809
Bobby.

35:39.811 --> 35:41.744
You can talk to me.

35:45.550 --> 35:47.550
Daniel was my son.

35:49.587 --> 35:52.421
My wife,
God rest her...

35:54.025 --> 35:57.193
...she didn't
die natural.

35:57.195 --> 35:59.462
Daniel and I
buried her together.

36:04.202 --> 36:06.902
After...

36:06.904 --> 36:09.071
well, Hunting,

36:09.073 --> 36:11.507
that -- that's what
got us through.

36:14.011 --> 36:16.979
Then the angel war
started.

36:16.981 --> 36:19.615
I'd been called up
to serve before,

36:19.617 --> 36:22.551
so they gave me a...

36:22.553 --> 36:24.453
platoon, I guess
you could call it.

36:25.757 --> 36:28.424
Dan was in it.

36:28.426 --> 36:31.660
We got separated.

36:31.662 --> 36:35.197
I guess you can figure
where this is headed.

36:42.507 --> 36:45.107
It wasn't your fault.

36:45.109 --> 36:48.210
I'm the one that
brought him to war.

36:48.212 --> 36:52.014
I'm the one
who sent him to die.

36:52.016 --> 36:55.918
I don't even know
what they did to him.

36:55.920 --> 36:58.654
The angels
took them.

36:58.656 --> 37:01.357
We never found
the bodies.

37:03.161 --> 37:05.060
I never figured

37:05.062 --> 37:08.364
I'd be any kind
of a father to a child.

37:10.701 --> 37:12.568
But Daniel...

37:15.139 --> 37:18.541
...was the best thing
in my life.

37:26.417 --> 37:30.753
I always assumed
that war'd kill me, too,

37:30.755 --> 37:32.421
but it didn't.

37:34.325 --> 37:36.992
I guess lately,
I've --

37:36.994 --> 37:39.261
I've been looking
for other options.

37:41.432 --> 37:43.499
The Hunting.

37:45.636 --> 37:47.503
It ends the same.

37:49.907 --> 37:51.207
No.

37:52.910 --> 37:55.077
You are not allowed
to give up on me.

37:57.281 --> 37:58.848
I don't...

38:00.551 --> 38:03.085
I don't know
any other way to live.

38:07.792 --> 38:10.226
Then we'll find one.

38:15.366 --> 38:16.866
Well, I talked
to Maggie.

38:16.868 --> 38:19.201
Says she can't wait to get
back in the saddle.

38:20.304 --> 38:21.618
Really?

38:21.619 --> 38:23.953
Well, she learned
from the best, huh?

38:26.791 --> 38:28.324
Boys.

38:28.326 --> 38:30.392
Um...

38:30.394 --> 38:32.628
We, uh --
We need to talk.

38:36.067 --> 38:37.299
Yeah, thank you
again.

38:37.301 --> 38:38.968
Bye.

38:38.970 --> 38:41.370
Okay, so, uh,

38:41.372 --> 38:43.472
the key is under
the garden gnome.

38:43.474 --> 38:45.274
And you're sure
she doesn't mind?

38:45.276 --> 38:47.510
No. Donna says her cabin
is your cabin.

38:47.512 --> 38:49.445
Take as much time
as you need.

38:49.447 --> 38:51.447
Sam.

38:56.621 --> 38:59.088
Yeah?
Listen,

38:59.090 --> 39:00.790
those things
I said before --

39:00.792 --> 39:02.258
Bobby,
forget about it.

39:02.260 --> 39:04.994
No, no. I...

39:04.996 --> 39:07.997
This job is no picnic.

39:09.133 --> 39:12.635
I don't know that I ever
really had it in me.

39:12.637 --> 39:14.403
But <i>you</i> do.

39:18.209 --> 39:19.742
We'll -- We'll just
be a few weeks.

39:19.744 --> 39:21.210
As soon as Bobby's back
on his feet --

39:21.212 --> 39:23.679
Hey, I know.

39:23.681 --> 39:25.447
If you need
anything --

39:25.449 --> 39:27.850
<i>anything,</i> I'm just
half a day's drive --

39:27.852 --> 39:30.619
Mom, go.
All right? Be happy.

39:55.279 --> 39:57.546
Garth? It's Dean.
Here's the deal --

39:57.548 --> 40:00.182
Yeah, that's right --
super-charged monsters.

40:00.184 --> 40:02.551
Yeah,
a whole new breed.

40:02.553 --> 40:04.153
So, I know things
are crazy right now,

40:04.155 --> 40:05.421
but you got
to listen to me.

40:05.423 --> 40:08.691
We got to stay safe,
use the buddy system.

40:08.693 --> 40:11.260
All right.
Spread the word.

40:15.199 --> 40:16.232
Okay.

40:16.234 --> 40:18.367
That's, uh --
That's everybody.

40:18.369 --> 40:20.102
Traps for Hunters.

40:20.104 --> 40:22.972
Friggin' awesome.

40:26.143 --> 40:28.844
Dean --
I know, I know.

40:28.846 --> 40:30.446
Not my fault.

40:30.448 --> 40:33.415
It's Michael.
It's all Michael.

40:33.417 --> 40:35.985
You know,
I've been trying to --

40:35.987 --> 40:39.121
not forget,
but to move on

40:39.123 --> 40:42.191
from what I --
from what we --

40:42.193 --> 40:44.260
from what he did.

40:44.262 --> 40:47.229
And I got to be honest,
I was -- I was...

40:47.231 --> 40:49.398
starting to feel
like myself again.

40:50.902 --> 40:52.568
Almost.

40:54.071 --> 40:56.739
- So we'll work harder.
- How, Sam?

40:56.741 --> 40:58.841
You get sleep three hours
of sleep a night.

40:58.843 --> 41:01.110
All right, then -- then --
then I'll sleep two.

41:02.747 --> 41:05.814
Dean, we're going
to find Michael,

41:05.816 --> 41:07.583
and when we do,

41:07.585 --> 41:09.752
we will kill him.

41:09.754 --> 41:11.287
How?

41:11.289 --> 41:12.688
I don't know.
We'll -- We'll --

41:12.690 --> 41:14.657
We'll track down Dark Kaia
and her spear.

41:14.659 --> 41:16.258
We'll --

41:16.260 --> 41:18.193
We'll find something.

41:21.232 --> 41:23.432
I hope you're right.
