You're such a dildo, dude.
[ Dennis ] Thanks, dude.

00:04.038 --> 00:06.605
Thanks.
That's a good way
to start the day.

00:06.607 --> 00:09.508
Is that
soy veggie health drink
supposed to erase the damage...

00:09.510 --> 00:10.642
you did to
your liver last night?

00:10.644 --> 00:14.179
Is that coffee gonna help you
forget that elephant
you slept with last night?

00:14.181 --> 00:16.548
Oh, come on.
You don't have to be
so judgmental.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.617
She was gross, dude.
She wasn't that gross,
all right?

00:18.619 --> 00:23.222
If you lowered your standards
a bit, you'd get laid more.
Give me a sip of this.

00:23.224 --> 00:24.056
No!
I just wanna try it.

00:24.058 --> 00:27.126
You do not get to taste
my delicious healthy drink
after making fun of it.

00:27.128 --> 00:31.563
Why not? Just give it to me.
'Cause I don't know what kind
of diseases that girl had.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.499
She doesn't have
any diseases!

00:33.501 --> 00:36.368
Dude, she was really gross.
Guys!

00:36.370 --> 00:40.239
We got
a real serious problem.
There's been a B&E, dude.

- [ Together ]
A what?
- A B&E, dude!

00:42.710 --> 00:45.110
A B&E?
What does that mean?

00:45.112 --> 00:47.780
Somebody broke into the bar
and stole our safe.

00:47.782 --> 00:50.783
Breaking and entering.
B&E.
No. No!

00:50.785 --> 00:52.684
Are you serious?
Oh, my God!

00:52.686 --> 00:55.154
- When did this happen?
- Last night, I guess.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.422
We just walked in this morning
and found it like that.

00:56.424 --> 00:59.224
Who locked up last night?
I did. But that's the thing.
The locks weren't even broken.

00:59.226 --> 01:02.461
So somebody just waltzed
in here and stole the safe?
But it's not my fault.

01:02.463 --> 01:06.432
- Well, it's somebody's fault.
- [ Dee ]
I know it's somebody's fault!

01:06.434 --> 01:09.134
Well, it's somebody's fault!
[ Dee ]
I know that!

01:09.136 --> 01:12.304
Guys! Guys!
We're not gonna get anywhere
yelling at each other!

01:12.306 --> 01:15.140
We need to be rational.
All right, all right.

01:15.142 --> 01:18.811
Okay! I think it's clear
what needs to happen.
What?

01:18.813 --> 01:20.712
We need to buy a gun.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.478
So what do you think?

01:52.480 --> 01:55.347
I think next time you boys
ought to get the kind of safe...

01:55.349 --> 01:58.250
that a relatively small man
can't just carry away.

01:58.252 --> 02:01.420
But there's been, like,
a string of these robberies
all over the area.

02:01.422 --> 02:04.189
You don't have
any leads or--
Not really.

02:04.191 --> 02:06.425
"Not really."
What in the hell
does that even mean?

02:06.427 --> 02:09.962
How could there not be
any leads? The guy must have
left something behind.

02:09.964 --> 02:11.797
- People are working on it.
- Hey, you guys.

02:11.799 --> 02:15.534
They're pretty sure it's
the same guy who's been hittin'
all the bars around here.

02:15.536 --> 02:18.437
We know, Charlie.
So we're done here,
Harris.

02:18.439 --> 02:21.406
What-- So that's it?
Yeah.

02:21.408 --> 02:23.909
We'll call you
if we come up with anything.

02:23.911 --> 02:26.545
Well, thanks.
Yeah, thanks.

02:26.547 --> 02:28.313
You know what?
Let's go get that gun.

02:28.315 --> 02:29.848
Whoa. Hey, hey.
No, no, no, no, no.
What?

02:29.850 --> 02:32.518
Guns are not a good idea.
They're dangerous.
Someone's gonna get hurt.

02:32.520 --> 02:35.921
- Yeah. Mac, no guns.
- Guys, somebody
stole our safe, right?

02:35.923 --> 02:38.891
Am I crazy?
We need to be able
to protect ourselves...

02:38.893 --> 02:40.526
in case something
like this happens again.

02:40.528 --> 02:42.828
Clearly, Philly's finest

Mac is absolutely right.

02:42.830 --> 02:46.698
What if one of us
was here when it happened?
We would have been killed.

02:46.700 --> 02:51.436
- No, you don't know that.
Come on.
- Hey, babe.

02:51.438 --> 02:54.406
Hey, Colin.
Mmm.

02:54.408 --> 02:56.375
Was that law enforcement?
Yeah.

02:56.377 --> 02:59.811
- Is everything all right?
- No, dude.
We got robbed last night.

02:59.813 --> 03:01.280
Oh, shit!

03:01.282 --> 03:04.416
Are you kiddin' me?
Oh-- What happened?

03:04.418 --> 03:08.420
Remember the other day when
you were making fun of us
for having such a tiny safe?

03:08.422 --> 03:13.992
That really sucks, guys.
Look, we have reservations
at Guajino's at 12:00, and--

03:13.994 --> 03:18.964

No guns.

Dude, your sister has
the worst taste in men.

03:25.606 --> 03:29.841
No shit. I hate that guy.
He's like a full-on
'80s movie stereotype.

03:29.843 --> 03:32.945
Plus, he's a total player.

03:32.947 --> 03:34.580

03:34.582 --> 03:36.448
You don't know about this?
Oh, my God!

03:36.450 --> 03:38.450
That guy's dated, like,
every hot bartender in town.

03:38.452 --> 03:41.587
I saw him a week ago
with Wendy from Dirty Frank's.

a gun.

03:52.899 --> 03:55.334
Do you really think
they're gonna buy one?

03:55.336 --> 03:56.735
No. I mean,
I told them not to,

03:56.737 --> 03:59.738
but Mac gets a boner
every single time
he thinks about a gun.

03:59.740 --> 04:03.475
Well, I think
it's a great idea.
I'm-- I'm sorry?

04:03.477 --> 04:05.811
I think it's really smart.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.779
Owning and knowing
how to properly use
a firearm...

04:07.781 --> 04:10.582
is an important part
of what makes
this country great.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.918
Well, that's what
I was trying to tell them--

04:12.920 --> 04:14.620
To tell you the truth--
What?

04:14.622 --> 04:18.624
There's nothing sexier
than when you're firing a gun.

04:18.626 --> 04:21.727
Actually,
it really turns me on.

04:21.729 --> 04:24.963
Well, that's exactly why
I want you to teach me
how to use one, sexy.

would be all mine.
