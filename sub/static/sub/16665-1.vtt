01:30.240 --> 01:32.527
Hey, Dennis. You escaped?

01:32.680 --> 01:33.920
Paroled.

01:34.080 --> 01:35.844
Time flies.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.764
You got a light?

01:40.760 --> 01:42.444
Got a smoke?

01:42.600 --> 01:44.523
Dennis.

05:20.560 --> 05:22.289
Why?

06:37.880 --> 06:39.166
Wake up.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.483
She's asleep.

06:51.840 --> 06:54.081
Don't tell me you quit.

07:08.600 --> 07:11.046
You've been dead over a year.

07:12.760 --> 07:14.762
Nobody told me.

07:14.920 --> 07:16.968
I'm telling you.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.490
<i>He'! '</i>

07:24.600 --> 07:27.080
I will not get caught twice.

07:29.480 --> 07:31.847
That's not how I want
to live anymore.

07:44.320 --> 07:46.288
Why does she hum like that?

07:47.640 --> 07:49.768
She's practicing.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.684
She does it all day long.

07:51.840 --> 07:54.571
The only time she sees a real piano
is in a church basement.

07:54.720 --> 07:55.721
Oh.

07:55.880 --> 07:58.406
They dust the hymnals
while she plays.

08:00.800 --> 08:03.007
Just let me stay a little while.

08:03.160 --> 08:05.003
Come on.

08:05.160 --> 08:06.924
Dennis, no.

08:09.200 --> 08:12.204
Then let me see her at least.

08:12.360 --> 08:14.249
You're dead.

08:15.640 --> 08:17.130
She's asleep.

08:47.880 --> 08:49.882
Hey, let me stay...

08:50.040 --> 08:52.042
tonight.

09:16.240 --> 09:18.242
Oh.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.688
Is that...?

09:25.360 --> 09:26.850
Is that Rene?

09:30.400 --> 09:32.209
Ouais.

09:32.360 --> 09:34.089
Why are you kissing him?

09:38.200 --> 09:41.283
Rene is going to ask me
to marry him,

09:41.440 --> 09:44.125
if Marie ever agrees to a divorce.

09:46.600 --> 09:49.046
What makes you think that?

09:50.760 --> 09:53.047
He told Michi.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.451
Are you all in love with him
or something?

09:58.440 --> 10:00.329
That's... that's none
of your business.

10:06.880 --> 10:09.121
Rene is not a thief.

10:10.560 --> 10:13.006
- Rene is a thief.
- Ex-thief.

10:13.160 --> 10:15.049
He never had the stomach for it,

10:15.200 --> 10:17.202
- or the heart.
- Or the head.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.169
You just don't really know him.

10:19.320 --> 10:21.288
I've known him my whole life.

10:21.440 --> 10:23.602
Well, then you should know
he's not a thief.

10:25.560 --> 10:28.325
What do you call this?

10:28.520 --> 10:31.205
Maman?

11:03.480 --> 11:05.721
You don't want me to be a thief?

11:05.880 --> 11:08.565
I will stop being a thief.

11:08.720 --> 11:11.246
What would be left of you?

11:19.440 --> 11:21.363
How did I die?

11:21.520 --> 11:23.329
Cancer.

11:25.480 --> 11:28.404
Doctors were never exactly sure
what kind, but...

11:29.400 --> 11:31.641
you suffered

11:31.800 --> 11:33.211
a lot.

11:37.280 --> 11:40.250
Of course I tried to keep Michi
from the worst of it.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.163
Maman?

12:41.440 --> 12:43.124
Monsieur Tremblay?

12:49.440 --> 12:52.364
Um... English, if you don't mind.

12:52.520 --> 12:56.161
You caught me in the act
of losing all hope, huh?

12:56.320 --> 12:58.891
Water is not enough.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.690
They... they told me to see you.

13:00.880 --> 13:03.611
Then they must have
told me to see you,

13:03.800 --> 13:07.122
- Monsieur...
- Girard, Dennis.

13:07.280 --> 13:10.045
Girard.

13:10.200 --> 13:11.611
Girard. Ay.

13:11.760 --> 13:13.410
- Gir...
- Girard.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.967
Um, Gi...

13:16.120 --> 13:18.407
ah, there you are.

13:18.560 --> 13:20.642
Voila.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.802
Dennis Girard.

13:22.960 --> 13:25.122
Dennis Girard.

13:27.280 --> 13:29.044
Tah!

13:29.240 --> 13:32.050
- Fresh out of the can, I see.
- Yeah.

13:32.200 --> 13:35.283
- I need a job.
- Teh! Good luck.

13:36.280 --> 13:38.044
- What?
- Terrible economy.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.362
So what am I supposed to do?

13:41.400 --> 13:44.131
Uh, I'd rely on family
if I were you.

13:44.280 --> 13:47.966
I don't have any family.

13:48.120 --> 13:51.169
Then you might try
living off the land.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.849
I don't have any land.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.843
You know, I don't even have
anywhere to live.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.005
You also need to stop
being so negative.

14:06.160 --> 14:07.321
Listen, you.

14:07.480 --> 14:10.165
I'll see you next month.

14:11.840 --> 14:13.604
Ooh.

14:13.760 --> 14:17.048
No, four weeks from now
is one day past Christmas day.

14:17.200 --> 14:20.761
- Okay.
- I'll see you the Wednesday following.

14:20.960 --> 14:23.566
Okay, so if there's no work here,

14:23.720 --> 14:25.290
I should go somewhere else, huh?

14:25.440 --> 14:27.204
Well, except you can't.

14:27.360 --> 14:30.728
Federal statute
forbids you leave the district.

14:30.880 --> 14:32.245
Listen, you.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.208
You have a great month

14:35.360 --> 14:37.328
and a very merry Christmas.

15:30.720 --> 15:32.529
They're not too bad.

15:40.160 --> 15:41.969
Fuck.

15:43.120 --> 15:44.645
Is that you?

15:47.960 --> 15:50.167
Hello, Dennis.

15:51.880 --> 15:53.405
Welcome home, Dennis.

15:55.920 --> 15:57.410
What are you drinking?

15:58.560 --> 16:00.085
Scotch. It's scotch.

16:00.240 --> 16:03.642
- Jackie, glasses, scotch.
- Ah.

16:03.800 --> 16:05.529
You're back.

16:10.480 --> 16:12.881
Rene, ici.

16:13.880 --> 16:14.927
Good for you.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.209
Why didn't you call me?

16:21.200 --> 16:22.565
I called my wife.

16:24.520 --> 16:26.170
Technically she's not...

16:26.320 --> 16:28.368
- Oh!
- Fuck!

16:32.840 --> 16:34.205
Yeah. Yeah.

16:47.960 --> 16:49.610
I need a job.

16:50.840 --> 16:53.446
- I've gone straight.
- Me too.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.849
There are no jobs.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.321
What do you do for money?

16:59.480 --> 17:01.608
I bought a truck, you know.

17:01.760 --> 17:04.161
I get jobs with it... this and that.
It's nothing steady.

17:04.319 --> 17:06.527
Oh, it's straight, but not steady.

17:06.680 --> 17:09.523
So what are these jobs?

17:09.680 --> 17:12.365
Selling Christmas trees
in New York City.

17:12.520 --> 17:14.727
There's money in holidays.
I did it last year.

17:14.880 --> 17:16.599
You got her that refrigerator
selling trees?

17:16.720 --> 17:18.210
Half of it.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.885
Yeah, okay, good.
I'll go with you.

17:24.040 --> 17:25.480
I already got a guy
who goes with me.

17:25.560 --> 17:27.289
- Yeah, me.
- No, you don't...

17:27.480 --> 17:29.209
I do it with Huge Antoine.

17:29.400 --> 17:30.925
He's hooked up down there.
I get the trees.

17:31.080 --> 17:32.081
All right, we'll all go.

17:32.280 --> 17:33.960
No, you... except we don't
need three guys.

17:34.040 --> 17:36.008
- We need two guys.
- It'll be a lot easier with three.

17:36.200 --> 17:38.726
Yeah, but I just...
I don't think it's a good idea.

17:42.680 --> 17:44.762
You know what I don't think
is a good idea?

17:44.920 --> 17:47.241
Me with no home, no money,

17:47.400 --> 17:49.721
no wife, no kid,
four years in jail

17:49.920 --> 17:53.208
and then finding out I died
from some shitty kind of cancer!

17:56.560 --> 18:00.167
All right, look, let me see
what I can do, all right?

19:01.520 --> 19:04.091
We load trees
tomorrow morning at 9:00.

19:10.240 --> 19:12.686
Pick me up at the Timmy's
on Chemin Calamar.

19:15.200 --> 19:18.044
Ah, Rene. Okay.

19:18.200 --> 19:21.204
- Trois mille.
- All right.

19:21.360 --> 19:22.521
- Okay, salut.
- Bye. Salut.

19:22.720 --> 19:24.165
- Joyeux NoÃ©l.
- Joyeux NoÃ©l.

19:24.320 --> 19:26.561
How much?

19:26.720 --> 19:29.326
- That's wholesale price.
- No shit.

19:29.520 --> 19:30.521
We've gotta pick out the trees.

19:30.680 --> 19:32.011
Just gotta go down.
They're right down there.

19:32.160 --> 19:33.400
- That's where they are?
- Yeah.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.010
It's got my name on it and all.

19:35.160 --> 19:37.527
I don't see no goddamn
Christmas trees around here.

19:37.680 --> 19:39.921
- Where's the truck?
- I don't know. You parked it.

19:40.040 --> 19:41.690
Where did I park it?

19:54.720 --> 19:57.326
- I just need a second here.
- All right, yeah.

19:57.480 --> 19:59.608
Take your time.

19:59.800 --> 20:02.451
I've got insane stamina.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.648
I've been doing Stav.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.529
Stav made its way
into prison culture yet?

20:06.720 --> 20:08.404
Probably not.

20:08.600 --> 20:11.649
It's a Norwegian art form...
a Norwegian martial art form

20:11.800 --> 20:14.724
discovered by a Norwegian
in the '90s.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.723
Guess what kind of mythology
it's based on.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.769
Norse... Norse mythology.

20:18.920 --> 20:21.366
It's got all these rune stances,
you know?

20:22.360 --> 20:23.725
Fe.

20:23.880 --> 20:25.405
Ur.

20:26.760 --> 20:28.922
R-U-N-E stances.

20:29.120 --> 20:31.407
Bjork. I know it's...
but it is...

20:31.560 --> 20:33.289
Where did you get the 3K from?

20:33.440 --> 20:36.603
It's a loan till we come back
with five times that much.

20:36.760 --> 20:38.000
Each?

20:38.160 --> 20:40.242
It's Christmas trees,
Dennis, not heroin.

20:40.400 --> 20:43.370
By the way, we're not
equal partners in this.

20:43.520 --> 20:46.330
This isn't the land of 50/50.
It's the land of 70/30.

20:46.480 --> 20:49.370
Oh, no,
this is the land of 60/40.

20:49.560 --> 20:51.767
You're on my land, Dennis.

20:59.880 --> 21:02.087
I never dealt
in heroin, you know.

21:02.280 --> 21:04.089
I never said you did.

21:15.400 --> 21:18.449
I don't miss looking over my shoulder
every second of the...

21:18.600 --> 21:20.489
money... that's the great, big...

21:20.640 --> 21:22.961
Therese, bless her...
she's got the steady...

21:23.120 --> 21:25.043
- you know, she went back to school...
- You want this next exit up here.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.565
To be a nurse's aid.
Isn't that something?

21:26.760 --> 21:28.125
She looks after old people
in their houses.

21:28.280 --> 21:29.930
- It's this one up here, okay?
- After her first day of work,

21:30.080 --> 21:32.526
she came home and she made me
promise to shoot her in the head

21:32.680 --> 21:33.806
the day she turns 65.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.291
I said, "Okay, Res, okay."

21:35.480 --> 21:36.811
Because that's love.

21:36.960 --> 21:39.486
It's this one right here.
Go, go, go.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.843
- How are you doing?
- How are you?

22:04.000 --> 22:05.843
Good. Passport.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.889
Oh, yeah. There you go.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.164
You having a good night?

22:12.320 --> 22:14.607
Having a good night.

22:15.600 --> 22:16.761
That's great.

22:16.920 --> 22:20.208
- So that's you, huh?
- Yeah, unfortunately.

22:22.400 --> 22:24.402
Yeah.

22:26.920 --> 22:28.809
Well, that's it.
That's my house.

22:28.960 --> 22:30.530
I sleep in there.

22:30.680 --> 22:32.284
It gets a little lonely,
but it's not too bad.

22:32.440 --> 22:34.641
Gosh, it is cold out here.
How do you do it every night?

22:34.680 --> 22:36.523
Unbelievable.
That is impressive.

22:36.680 --> 22:38.091
Yeah.

22:38.240 --> 22:39.730
- What, is that 45/55?
- What?

22:39.920 --> 22:42.526
The blend on your uniform...
45 wool, 55 poly?

22:42.680 --> 22:44.364
- Don't touch me, sir.
- Oh, sorry.

22:44.520 --> 22:46.807
Fabric content is something
I'm very interested in.

22:46.960 --> 22:48.883
My skin is sensitive.
I can't wear wool.

22:49.040 --> 22:50.371
Wool socks... forget about it.

22:50.520 --> 22:52.321
A wool scarf... that makes me
want to rush off

22:52.440 --> 22:54.727
to the nearest guillotine,
you know what I'm saying?

22:54.880 --> 22:57.611
My mom, when I was little,
used to put me under this wool blanket.

22:57.760 --> 22:59.125
She said, "Rene,
you gotta sleep under this."

22:59.280 --> 23:00.320
It's gonna keep you warm."

23:00.480 --> 23:02.130
- Go back to the cab, sir.
- Sure thing.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.203
By the way,
I really appreciate what you do.

23:04.400 --> 23:06.004
These trees
haven't been inventoried.

23:06.160 --> 23:09.289
I would consider it a Christmas kindness
if you picked one out for yourself.

23:09.440 --> 23:12.523
- Please go back to the cab, sir.
- I'm going back to the cab.

23:13.840 --> 23:16.889
And I don't care how big it is either.
Grab a big one for your kids.

23:50.160 --> 23:51.571
Okay.

23:51.720 --> 23:53.484
Move it.

24:10.200 --> 24:11.725
Mwah.

24:14.360 --> 24:17.125
It just seems cruel to keep it
locked up in an apartment all day.

24:17.280 --> 24:20.250
And that's what I told her
to tell the nurse... Lucy, you know.

24:20.400 --> 24:23.529
You gotta... it's not like a chair.
It's a dog, you know.

24:23.680 --> 24:25.640
You can't expect it to tell itself
it doesn't need

24:25.680 --> 24:27.205
- to take a piss when it clearly does.
- Please shut up.

24:27.400 --> 24:28.970
- It's not like a chair.
- Shut up.

24:29.120 --> 24:31.440
- It wouldn't do that or even couldn't.
- Shut up, shut up,

24:31.480 --> 24:34.165
shut up, shut up, shut up.

24:34.320 --> 24:36.482
Please.

24:46.480 --> 24:48.608
I just... I love 'em, Dennis.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.002
- I just love 'em.
- Shut up.

24:54.920 --> 24:56.968
I do.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.970
Hey, answer that.

25:06.120 --> 25:08.771
- Answer it.
- Christ.

25:10.760 --> 25:12.922
- It's her.
- What?

25:13.080 --> 25:15.048
- It's Therese.
- Well, answer it. I'm driving.

25:15.240 --> 25:17.846
No.

25:19.840 --> 25:21.842
Hey, Res. How are you?

25:23.560 --> 25:26.006
Yeah, I'm, uh...

25:26.160 --> 25:27.366
hey, guess who's here with me.

25:30.720 --> 25:32.563
Uh, uh, no, no.

25:32.760 --> 25:35.081
Um, Antoine couldn't
make it this year.

25:35.240 --> 25:37.971
It's a friend of a friend of Oscar's.

25:39.440 --> 25:41.886
No, he's an... an Inuit,

25:42.040 --> 25:44.247
Inuit friend of a friend
of Oscar's, yeah.

25:44.400 --> 25:47.609
But, you know, he grew up
around trees, so that's good.

25:47.760 --> 25:50.889
He... he can really help out.
He knows what he's doing.

25:51.040 --> 25:52.451
Yeah. You know what?

25:52.600 --> 25:54.728
Can I call you
when I'm not driving my rig?

25:54.880 --> 25:57.042
My rig.

25:58.320 --> 25:59.481
I'm glad.

25:59.640 --> 26:01.881
Good. I'm glad
when I can cheer you up.

26:02.080 --> 26:04.401
Yeah, okay.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.287
There's no trees there,
you know.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.568
- Where?
- Nunavut.

26:14.760 --> 26:16.569
Where's that?

26:16.760 --> 26:19.445
Where Oscar's best friend
the Inuit lives.

26:19.640 --> 26:22.405
Trees. Fuck.

26:22.600 --> 26:24.409
I didn't say "best friend."

26:27.600 --> 26:28.931
Oh, man.

26:31.640 --> 26:34.883
Dennis, why are you with me, huh?
Why are you coming?

26:35.880 --> 26:38.247
I want money...
money on the up and up.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.287
I'm gonna buy Michi
a Christmas present.

26:43.440 --> 26:45.602
Oh, really?
A present from a ghost?

26:45.760 --> 26:48.127
What do ghosts give for Christmas?
White sheets?

26:56.560 --> 26:58.961
She would like a present.

28:15.600 --> 28:18.604
- What, this is it?
- This is it.

28:26.960 --> 28:28.689
This is it.

28:29.680 --> 28:32.251
This is garbage.

28:32.400 --> 28:34.004
This is where you were last year?

28:34.160 --> 28:36.083
You know, we should probably
get a good night's sleep,

28:36.240 --> 28:37.400
start on everything tomorrow.

28:37.440 --> 28:38.441
We've got a lot of work to do.

28:38.600 --> 28:40.489
- It's gonna be a good month, Dennis.
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:40.640 --> 28:42.404
- Who's gonna guard the trees?
- They're fine. They're in the truck.

28:42.560 --> 28:44.403
No. No. Someone could break in.

28:44.560 --> 28:46.608
We're totally fine.

28:46.760 --> 28:48.364
<i>He'! '.</i>

28:49.400 --> 28:50.606
How are you?

28:50.760 --> 28:53.843
Hey, guess what...
they still don't have stars here.

28:54.040 --> 28:56.247
What are you doing?

28:56.400 --> 28:58.448
She asleep?

28:59.440 --> 29:01.044
Hey, I left something for her.

29:01.200 --> 29:03.009
Will you put it in her room?

29:03.160 --> 29:05.162
It's an Advent calendar.

29:07.240 --> 29:08.366
Yeah, she can eat chocolate.

29:08.520 --> 29:09.841
She can tell you
about baby Jesus,

29:09.960 --> 29:12.247
then count down the days
till I get home.

29:14.280 --> 29:15.611
I know. It's gonna be tough.

29:15.760 --> 29:18.445
But I'm gonna be coming back
with some major dollars.

29:18.600 --> 29:20.728
Okay. Dream good.

29:28.120 --> 29:30.327
Hey, if you need to pee
or poo or anything,

29:30.480 --> 29:32.847
you can use Nick's Restaurant
on the corner.

30:38.840 --> 30:41.286
Sit anywhere you like.

30:41.480 --> 30:43.403
<i>38w.â</i>

30:57.440 --> 30:59.169
Are you a customer?

30:59.320 --> 31:01.209
Kristoff! Come here, you moron.

31:01.360 --> 31:04.045
You can get one pee for free, man.
You do not get two.

31:04.200 --> 31:06.282
- You hear me? What does that sign say?
- Jeez, I heard it all, man.

31:06.440 --> 31:10.001
Customers only, man.
Customers fucking only, man.

31:10.160 --> 31:11.764
Get the fuck out of here.

31:11.920 --> 31:13.729
Bring me some money!

32:17.440 --> 32:19.522
- Hey.
- Hey. Monica, right?

32:19.680 --> 32:21.364
Tabar-fucking-nak.

32:21.520 --> 32:23.409
Nice to see you.

32:29.960 --> 32:32.611
Hey. HEY-

32:34.960 --> 32:37.167
It smells so good.

32:37.320 --> 32:38.970
Yeah. That?

32:39.120 --> 32:40.451
Just a little taller.

32:41.840 --> 32:44.764
Oh. Oh...

32:44.920 --> 32:46.285
Crank it.

32:51.480 --> 32:53.323
Another $25, I can deliver it.

32:57.560 --> 32:59.480
Oh, it's such a pleasure
doing business with you.

33:04.440 --> 33:06.442
That's 200 for that one.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.000
- You got it.
- Thank you very much.

33:08.080 --> 33:10.890
Enjoy. Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to you.

33:13.520 --> 33:15.443
Ah!

33:15.600 --> 33:17.682
- Shit.
- Rat.

33:26.320 --> 33:28.721
That's it.

33:44.760 --> 33:46.683
Hey. Are you okay?

33:54.440 --> 33:56.442
Dennis, come... no, no. Dennis.

33:57.840 --> 33:59.444
Dennis, no.

34:01.680 --> 34:03.444
Hey, you have a customer.

34:03.640 --> 34:06.211
Season's greetings.
Looking to buy a tree?

34:06.360 --> 34:09.409
Uh, no.
Uh, looking to sell them.

34:09.560 --> 34:11.402
Yeah.

34:11.560 --> 34:13.562
We were here first.

34:13.719 --> 34:15.688
Oh, man.

34:15.840 --> 34:18.047
Yeah, I'm so sorry.

34:18.239 --> 34:21.210
It's just we've been coming down here
the last seven years and...

34:21.360 --> 34:22.929
May I ask where you're from?

34:23.120 --> 34:24.121
- Originally?
- Mm.

34:24.280 --> 34:26.089
Chevy Chase.
But we tree out of Bennington.

34:26.239 --> 34:27.241
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

34:27.400 --> 34:29.482
See, I... I just got out
of Hochelaga CCC.

34:29.639 --> 34:30.926
- Do you know it?
- I don't.

34:31.080 --> 34:33.242
It's a penitentiary
in Quebec, Canada.

34:33.400 --> 34:35.289
- Crazy.
- Yes, sir. Yeah.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.806
But right now
I'm trying to go straight,

34:37.960 --> 34:40.201
you know,
for the very first time in my life.

34:40.360 --> 34:41.600
Wow. Good for you.

34:41.760 --> 34:43.409
You know, Laird's brother
just got out of rehab.

34:43.600 --> 34:44.639
He was in rehab for oxy...

34:44.760 --> 34:45.841
Which I cannot do

34:46.000 --> 34:48.606
with you right here
across the street.

34:51.239 --> 34:53.607
Oh, I don't want to have to do
anything that I'll regret.

34:55.400 --> 34:57.607
Well, I don't really know
what you're saying,

34:57.760 --> 34:59.922
but we're all set up, you know.

35:00.080 --> 35:02.970
We're already moving bush
and we're just gonna stay put.

35:03.160 --> 35:04.889
<i>30m! -</i>

35:05.080 --> 35:06.445
Okay.

35:14.280 --> 35:16.442
Good understanding, bro.

35:25.800 --> 35:27.040
Hey, what the fuck?

35:28.960 --> 35:30.803
You are gone,

35:30.960 --> 35:32.485
or whenever I want, I take this

35:32.640 --> 35:34.802
and I saw right through
your little fucking neck.

35:34.960 --> 35:36.450
It'll happen so fast,

35:36.600 --> 35:38.807
you won't be able to open
your fucking eyes.

35:38.960 --> 35:40.962
Now you see that guy
over there?

35:41.120 --> 35:42.849
I'm gonna get him to help me.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.889
He just waved at me.

35:45.080 --> 35:49.642
- He just...
- Yeah, well, that's what he does.

35:49.800 --> 35:51.723
Season's greetings

35:51.920 --> 35:53.729
from Canada.

36:08.920 --> 36:11.127
Did you say "please" at least?

36:14.840 --> 36:16.560
You know, if they call the cops,
we're done.

36:16.680 --> 36:18.330
Oh, he won't.

36:18.480 --> 36:19.925
I wouldn't be surprised.

36:20.080 --> 36:23.050
Oh, that's all you ever are
is surprised.

36:23.240 --> 36:25.846
Hey! Ho! Ho! Ho! Hey!

36:26.000 --> 36:28.207
Argh.

36:28.360 --> 36:30.044
Trees!

36:33.360 --> 36:35.522
- That was terrible.
- "Trees"?

36:35.680 --> 36:37.444
I'll take care of that
from now on.

36:37.600 --> 36:39.489
"Trees!"

36:39.640 --> 36:41.642
We need to hydro...

36:43.440 --> 36:46.125
We need... I'm g... I just want...

37:32.280 --> 37:33.964
Christmas trees!

37:34.960 --> 37:36.769
Can I interest you in a tree?

37:36.920 --> 37:38.445
We've got Christmas trees.

37:38.600 --> 37:40.648
You don't want that tree.
Why would you buy this...

37:40.800 --> 37:42.484
That isn't even real.

37:42.640 --> 37:45.689
- Ugh, that smells like a fire hazard.
- Hey!

37:45.840 --> 37:47.444
These are more
than just Christmas trees.

37:47.600 --> 37:49.443
These are memories.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.523
Get over here and smell
some memories.

38:00.960 --> 38:02.291
Whoa.

38:03.800 --> 38:07.009
I see a naked woman
in that apartment.

38:07.160 --> 38:08.650
Oh, Dennis.

38:08.800 --> 38:12.691
Oh, we got some naked jigs.

38:13.680 --> 38:15.728
Man, New York.

38:15.880 --> 38:18.167
New York City
at Christmas, Dennis.

38:20.680 --> 38:21.681
Where you saw

38:21.840 --> 38:23.126
the Flyers and Penguins
obviously some...

38:23.320 --> 38:25.766
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

38:25.920 --> 38:26.967
- Oh, yeah?
- There you go.

38:27.120 --> 38:28.441
Right there,
two teams that really

38:28.520 --> 38:30.280
- just can't stand each other...
- All right.

38:35.320 --> 38:36.446
The NHL this year,

38:36.600 --> 38:39.444
obviously are a very big cause
for concern.

38:39.600 --> 38:41.284
Canada is in a recession, isn't it?

38:48.920 --> 38:51.241
Trees!

38:51.400 --> 38:53.846
Ho, ho, ho!

38:54.000 --> 38:55.604
You need a tree?

38:56.840 --> 38:58.763
Come on, look at 'em.
Smell 'em.

38:58.920 --> 39:02.447
'Tis that t...
jolly time of the season.

39:02.600 --> 39:04.364
Are you looking for a tree?
We've got trees.

39:04.520 --> 39:07.241
- I've got eyes.
- Yeah, they're an amazing color.

39:07.280 --> 39:08.725
- What, are they purpley-brown?
- No.

39:08.880 --> 39:09.961
- Regular brown.
- No.

39:10.160 --> 39:12.208
- Blue.
- Go away.

39:12.360 --> 39:13.407
Idiot.

39:14.520 --> 39:17.126
Eh, she'll be back. You watch.

39:18.520 --> 39:20.568
- Want to buy a tree?
- Fuck off.

40:00.760 --> 40:02.728
We need wood.

40:05.240 --> 40:07.527
Hey, what are you doing? Rene.

40:07.680 --> 40:09.409
- Christ's sake.
- Hey, put it back.

40:09.560 --> 40:12.166
No, God da... put it back!

40:12.320 --> 40:14.687
We've been here 10 days
and we have sold nothing.

40:14.840 --> 40:16.842
We could have hit
three stereo stores back home

40:17.000 --> 40:18.764
with half the trouble.

40:18.920 --> 40:22.129
Coming here
is the stupidest thing I ever done.

40:22.280 --> 40:24.169
Yeah? Well, I disagree.

40:24.320 --> 40:25.731
Yeah.

40:25.880 --> 40:28.929
Last year we barely broke even.

40:29.080 --> 40:31.321
And I nearly got pneumonia twice.

40:31.480 --> 40:34.165
Going straight
is 10 times the work

40:34.320 --> 40:37.160
and you make about a million times
less than the bullshit we used to do.

40:37.280 --> 40:38.281
- But you know what else?
- What?

40:38.440 --> 40:40.169
You don't go to prison.

40:44.080 --> 40:45.081
Oh, wow.

40:45.240 --> 40:48.722
You really are a dumb, dumb...

40:48.920 --> 40:50.570
fuckhead, Rene.

40:58.960 --> 41:01.088
Therese was right about you.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.564
Sorry?

41:05.560 --> 41:07.210
You're a criminal.

41:09.240 --> 41:11.686
With a small dick.

41:28.160 --> 41:30.845
Nobody wants to sell me tree?

41:31.000 --> 41:33.002
Okay, don't sell me tree.

41:33.160 --> 41:35.003
Oh.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.924
Oh, hey.

41:38.120 --> 41:39.485
Sorry, the other guy's not here.

41:39.680 --> 41:41.444
And what is wrong with you?

41:41.640 --> 41:45.326
- What? Nothing.
- Why can't you sell me tree?

41:46.680 --> 41:47.681
Yeah.

41:47.840 --> 41:49.001
You got light?

41:50.200 --> 41:51.611
Light?

42:05.440 --> 42:07.204
- You got biggest, best tree?
- Mm-hmm.

42:07.360 --> 42:10.523
You're liar. Vermont guys
three block over got...

42:10.680 --> 42:12.842
they have biggest, best trees.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.604
- Mm-mm.
- But I feel so lazy.

42:14.800 --> 42:17.087
- No sleep last night.
- There.

42:18.200 --> 42:20.089
Yes, good.

42:21.720 --> 42:23.370
Maybe.

42:26.560 --> 42:28.210
How can I see this?

42:34.920 --> 42:37.082
- Give me that.
- I got it.

42:44.720 --> 42:47.041
- There you go.
- Okay.

42:47.200 --> 42:49.202
- Yeah?
- How much is this?

42:49.360 --> 42:52.409
Oh, uh, $20.

42:52.560 --> 42:55.131
_ Ay, no. - $15.

42:55.280 --> 42:58.602
$15? This $200 tree.

42:58.800 --> 42:59.926
- What?
- Yeah.

43:00.080 --> 43:02.765
But, you know,
then I do the thing with you

43:02.920 --> 43:05.844
and you give it to me for $175.

43:08.680 --> 43:09.681
Okay. Yeah.

43:09.840 --> 43:11.922
I got money.
I need it delivered.

43:12.080 --> 43:14.162
Oh, uh, well,

43:14.360 --> 43:16.089
I... I can't leave the lot right now.

43:16.280 --> 43:18.851
- When can you?
- When the other guy gets back.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.764
- Very soon.
- Okay.

43:20.920 --> 43:23.924
The house is Van Toiler Street,
number 192.

43:24.120 --> 43:25.610
- 192 Van Toiler Street.
- Here.

43:25.760 --> 43:27.000
- Very good. Thank you.
- Good. Thank you.

43:27.160 --> 43:29.242
Uh, sorry,
what about the money?

43:29.400 --> 43:30.731
First tree, then money.

43:30.920 --> 43:33.446
I know what people like you are like.

43:48.400 --> 43:50.971
I was just talking to this man

43:51.120 --> 43:53.282
who says
he hasn't eaten anything

43:53.480 --> 43:55.482
for the last three years
of his life

43:55.640 --> 43:58.610
except bananas
and vegetable broth.

43:58.760 --> 44:00.569
Says he's never felt better.

44:00.720 --> 44:02.245
Guess what.

44:03.920 --> 44:05.809
I brought you something.

44:08.600 --> 44:11.649
You know, you really hurt my feelings
when you called me a fuckhead.

44:11.800 --> 44:13.643
Now you should have
some of this.

44:13.800 --> 44:15.609
All right? Just...

44:15.760 --> 44:16.761
where are you...?

44:16.960 --> 44:18.485
Dennis, come on.

44:18.640 --> 44:20.210
Where...?

44:20.360 --> 44:22.362
Where are you going?

44:22.520 --> 44:24.170
De...

44:24.320 --> 44:26.527
hey, did you sell a tree?
Did...?

44:26.720 --> 44:28.848
Oh, yeah.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.729
Amazing!

44:47.520 --> 44:50.046
Hi there.

44:50.200 --> 44:53.044
You're lucky I still suffer
the insomnia.

44:54.960 --> 44:57.850
Okay, come in, please.
This way.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.128
And remove your shoes.

45:03.200 --> 45:07.728
Where I am from, my father cuts down
Christmas tree himself

45:07.880 --> 45:09.962
in Chernyayevsky Forest.

45:11.800 --> 45:15.043
This is before they shot him
to death, of course.

45:15.200 --> 45:17.089
This way.

45:19.760 --> 45:21.444
You have family?

45:21.600 --> 45:24.410
Yeah. I mean, I'll be going
back to them, yeah.

45:24.560 --> 45:26.767
You should put it here
by window.

45:26.920 --> 45:30.720
Dentists like to show off
all their acquisitions.

45:30.880 --> 45:33.690
Olga, how many times
must we tell you?

45:33.840 --> 45:36.127
We are not dentists.

45:36.280 --> 45:38.965
I am periodontist,
she is oral surgeon.

45:39.120 --> 45:40.884
Yeah.

45:41.040 --> 45:43.247
No, fresh painted!

45:43.400 --> 45:44.561
- Fresh.
- Oh, sorry.

45:44.760 --> 45:47.525
Ugh.

45:47.720 --> 45:49.768
Guess what color dentists choose.

45:50.880 --> 45:52.006
Guess.

45:52.160 --> 45:54.322
- Dentists.
- I don't know.

45:54.520 --> 45:55.521
Enamel.

45:55.680 --> 45:56.966
Pshh.

45:57.120 --> 45:59.168
No fucking imagination.

45:59.360 --> 46:01.408
No. Wait here.

46:01.560 --> 46:03.528
Get this.

46:03.680 --> 46:07.162
Ah, they're here.

46:09.040 --> 46:11.361
Here we are.

46:11.520 --> 46:13.363
(Dy-

46:14.360 --> 46:16.362
I got it.

46:27.600 --> 46:29.489
You like this piano?

46:29.680 --> 46:31.091
Uh-huh.

46:31.240 --> 46:33.607
It plays beautiful music.

46:33.760 --> 46:36.240
But I cannot say
the same for me.

46:38.320 --> 46:40.482
You like Rachmaninoff?

46:40.640 --> 46:42.529
Hmm?

46:48.000 --> 46:50.526
This is not Rachmaninoff.

47:03.320 --> 47:05.084
Arthritis.

47:06.520 --> 47:09.444
Don't I look too young
for joint issues, huh?

47:10.520 --> 47:13.046
Okay, we do this.

47:13.200 --> 47:15.601
- Here, please this way.
- Okay.

47:15.760 --> 47:17.489
In here.

47:17.640 --> 47:19.881
Okay. Here.

47:20.040 --> 47:21.883
- Okay?
- Yeah, just get it...

47:22.040 --> 47:24.725
Down, down, down, down, down.

47:24.880 --> 47:26.370
Is it in?

47:26.520 --> 47:28.010
- Yes.
- It's there?

47:28.160 --> 47:30.049
But it's not in center.

47:30.240 --> 47:32.049
Up, LIP, up! up'

47:32.240 --> 47:34.641
- Like that?
- Down, down.

47:34.800 --> 47:38.566
Okay, now screw put in.

47:41.040 --> 47:42.121
- Yes, we can screw...
- Ow.

47:42.200 --> 47:44.601
Okay, good.

47:44.760 --> 47:48.003
Oh. Oh.

47:48.160 --> 47:50.049
You okay? Here, sit.

47:51.040 --> 47:53.042
Sit. Okay.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.889
Okay.

47:58.040 --> 48:00.611
If you're going to throw up,

48:00.760 --> 48:03.240
do it in tree stand,

48:03.440 --> 48:05.488
not on hardwood floor.

48:07.120 --> 48:08.804
Okay?

48:23.440 --> 48:25.602
Morning. Here.

48:25.760 --> 48:27.569
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

48:27.720 --> 48:29.370
Have this.

48:30.600 --> 48:32.125
Okay.

48:38.560 --> 48:40.961
Here, this is yours.

48:41.960 --> 48:43.769
Thank you.

48:44.760 --> 48:46.762
This.

48:48.680 --> 48:50.364
Tip,

48:50.520 --> 48:52.648
courtesy of dentists.

48:59.080 --> 49:00.764
Thank you.

49:39.200 --> 49:41.202
120.

49:49.040 --> 49:50.246
Thanks.

49:50.400 --> 49:52.402
Merry Christmas.

49:58.360 --> 49:59.930
What's that?

50:00.080 --> 50:02.208
- It's for the money.
- What money?

50:02.360 --> 50:04.203
From the sales.

50:04.360 --> 50:07.045
I'm gonna keep the key

50:07.200 --> 50:09.965
and you record the sales.

50:27.280 --> 50:29.282
We should be Quebecois.

50:34.200 --> 50:36.362
It might help.

50:36.520 --> 50:38.409
I go to cut down this tree

50:38.560 --> 50:40.449
behind the humble shack

50:40.640 --> 50:43.007
that I call home
in the Motherland.

50:43.160 --> 50:44.764
I see a butt of a bear.

50:44.920 --> 50:47.241
He's in... what do you say?
Hibernation.

50:47.440 --> 50:49.090
I don't want to wake this bear,

50:49.240 --> 50:52.084
so I do what any resourceful
Quebecois lumberjack does...

50:52.240 --> 50:54.971
I put the silencer on the axe.

50:55.120 --> 50:58.010
I have a tree so pretty,
it look like your twin.

50:58.200 --> 51:00.726
Together, you look like
the Mona Lisa

51:00.880 --> 51:02.609
and the Mona Liser.

51:07.120 --> 51:09.851
Oh, fuck me.

51:10.040 --> 51:11.610
Hey, we moved, okay? We moved.

51:11.760 --> 51:13.680
- Hey, hey.
- Get out of the way.

51:13.840 --> 51:15.569
We don't want...

51:18.640 --> 51:21.041
That's fine. That's it?

51:22.080 --> 51:23.650
What the fuck?

51:34.480 --> 51:36.130
She home?

51:36.320 --> 51:38.561
- Who?
- Our naked neighbor.

51:38.720 --> 51:40.961
This is about the time
she usually gets back.

51:41.160 --> 51:44.482
I thought I saw her
on the street the other day

51:44.640 --> 51:46.483
but with clothes on.
It's so hard...

51:46.640 --> 51:48.449
<i>He'! '.</i>

51:48.600 --> 51:50.523
Hey, it's me.

51:50.680 --> 51:52.489
Yeah? Aww.

51:52.640 --> 51:54.324
I miss you too.

51:54.480 --> 51:56.050
By the way,
I meant to tell you,

51:56.200 --> 52:00.250
I found myself in a conversation
with a male nurse the other day

52:00.400 --> 52:02.528
and we got on the subject
of footwear.

52:02.720 --> 52:06.850
And he swears by this brand
called Fushies or...

52:07.000 --> 52:10.322
no, Kushies with a K.

52:10.520 --> 52:13.967
Kushies. Yeah. Yeah.
I think so.

52:14.120 --> 52:16.691
He said expensive,
but it was totally worth it.

52:16.840 --> 52:19.491
Yeah, he said he had his pair
for, like, three years or something

52:19.640 --> 52:21.481
and that they were like new.
And you know what?

52:21.520 --> 52:23.522
I looked at them
and they did look completely new.

52:23.680 --> 52:24.920
Hey, what are you doing?

52:25.000 --> 52:27.685
You know, there's this
naked woman who lives across...

52:27.840 --> 52:29.569
I'm just taking this to Nick's.

52:29.720 --> 52:31.041
He's gonna help us with business.

52:31.160 --> 52:33.561
Oh, you're not
giving away our trees.

52:33.720 --> 52:35.688
Let me call you back.

52:35.880 --> 52:37.086
Love you too.

52:37.240 --> 52:38.969
We've sold one tree so far.

52:39.120 --> 52:40.929
I've sold one tree so far.

52:41.080 --> 52:42.127
- Yeah.
- One.

52:42.280 --> 52:43.281
- We're on a roll.
- Oh?

52:43.440 --> 52:45.966
- Don't fight it.
- This is a business.

52:46.120 --> 52:48.691
You... what kind of trees
are these?

52:48.840 --> 52:50.604
Christmas trees.

52:50.760 --> 52:53.047
Right, but what kind?
Are they firs?

52:53.200 --> 52:54.611
Are they pines? What kind?

52:54.760 --> 52:57.366
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.

52:57.520 --> 53:00.683
We're... we're not selling trees.
We're selling a mood.

53:00.840 --> 53:03.081
We're selling a feeling,
you know?

53:03.280 --> 53:05.248
The tale of two Quebecois

53:05.400 --> 53:07.004
with the joual and the tuque

53:07.200 --> 53:09.120
and the tobacco-stained teeth...

53:09.240 --> 53:11.083
who snowshoed their way here

53:11.240 --> 53:13.242
and spread their winter
carnival vibration.

53:13.400 --> 53:15.880
- You're kind of sickening.
- I tell you, the joint has crushed

53:16.040 --> 53:17.690
whatever little left
you had in there.

53:17.880 --> 53:19.564
I'm taking this to Nick's, all right?

53:19.720 --> 53:20.721
It's gonna help us with business.

53:20.920 --> 53:22.843
Don't worry, I won't
be gone for very long.

53:23.000 --> 53:26.049
Ha! Yeah, gone.
Exactly. That's you.

53:26.200 --> 53:28.123
I never would have had
to go to prison

53:28.280 --> 53:30.169
if you had just shown up.

53:30.320 --> 53:32.004
No. No.

53:32.160 --> 53:34.686
Dennis, I gave you
plenty of warning.

53:34.840 --> 53:37.320
I told you that I needed
to stay home and help Marie.

53:37.520 --> 53:40.603
Yeah. It was a safe job
and you were the safe cracker.

53:40.760 --> 53:42.444
That's where you needed to be.

53:42.600 --> 53:45.046
Which is why you shouldn't
have gone in alone.

53:46.040 --> 53:47.644
I told you.

53:49.000 --> 53:52.129
I had to. I have a family.

53:54.880 --> 53:58.202
Oh, no.
Don't you feel sorry for me.

53:58.360 --> 54:00.249
Too late.

54:02.440 --> 54:04.886
- I'm taking this to Nick's.
- Yeah.

54:07.640 --> 54:09.642
You touch my wife's hair?

54:09.800 --> 54:11.450
What?

54:12.720 --> 54:15.530
Do you touch my wife's hair?

54:15.680 --> 54:17.682
Yeah, of course I do.

54:23.720 --> 54:25.927
I don't want you touching it.

54:26.960 --> 54:30.123
I don't want you smelling it.

54:30.280 --> 54:32.362
I'm gonna touch it.

54:32.520 --> 54:34.488
And I smell it.

54:34.640 --> 54:36.722
And I kiss it.

54:36.880 --> 54:38.405
- And I'm gonna marry her.
- No, you're not.

54:38.560 --> 54:39.561
- Yes, I am.
- No.

54:39.720 --> 54:42.291
As soon as Marie
gives me a divorce...

54:43.440 --> 54:45.010
lam.

55:14.360 --> 55:17.125
- Calling collect.
- Name of your party?

55:17.280 --> 55:20.170
- Therese.
- And your name?

55:25.080 --> 55:26.411
Rene.

55:26.560 --> 55:28.244
Rene.

55:38.520 --> 55:40.682
Don't call me like that, cheri.

55:40.840 --> 55:42.444
I could barely say I loved you...

56:24.440 --> 56:25.960
The weird thing is,

56:26.040 --> 56:27.121
last night in my dream,

56:27.320 --> 56:29.320
this very tree leaned over
and whispered in my ear,

56:29.440 --> 56:32.364
"Sell me to the guy
with a coat and a hat."

56:32.520 --> 56:34.363
Kismet.

56:40.120 --> 56:41.645
Shit.

57:15.080 --> 57:18.004
You know, she wishes that...

57:18.200 --> 57:19.964
she hadn't done that...

57:21.080 --> 57:22.570
told your kid that you're dead.

57:45.800 --> 57:47.006
Oh, fuck yeah!

57:47.160 --> 57:48.844
We sold five trees today, man.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.321
Five trees. Let's get a drink.
Let's celebrate.

57:51.480 --> 57:54.529
- No, I'm not leaving the lot.
- Every place around here is closed.

57:55.840 --> 57:56.966
I know a girl who lives
right there.

57:57.160 --> 57:59.811
She'll be up.
She'll give us a drink.

57:59.960 --> 58:01.564
How do you know a girl
who lives right there?

58:01.720 --> 58:03.722
From last year. Come on.

58:05.800 --> 58:07.529
Come on.

58:14.040 --> 58:16.327
Dennis! Dennis.

58:16.480 --> 58:18.767
- Dennis!
- Come over here!

58:20.440 --> 58:22.920
- Dennis!
- Dennis, come over!

58:24.360 --> 58:26.283
We got you a...

58:26.480 --> 58:28.323
we got you a drink.

58:28.520 --> 58:30.648
Come on.

58:30.800 --> 58:32.240
Oh, I think that was Dennis's.

58:32.360 --> 58:34.488
Too-big tree is tipping over.

58:37.440 --> 58:39.169
- At palace of dentists.
- Oh, hang on.

58:39.320 --> 58:41.402
Someone was
offering me a free scotch.

58:41.560 --> 58:44.245
I... I did.

58:44.400 --> 58:46.528
I'll offer you his
if he doesn't take it.

58:46.680 --> 58:49.411
- Is he your boyfriend?
- No.

58:49.560 --> 58:52.564
- Is she your girlfriend?
- No.

58:52.720 --> 58:55.166
Then come,
fix stupid fucking tree.

58:55.320 --> 58:58.767
I'm gonna marry his wife,
so he's feeling a little mad and sad.

59:04.360 --> 59:06.010
Shoes.

59:52.240 --> 59:54.607
I made you some tacos.

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:07.406
Do you think I am your friend?

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:09.324
Uh-huh.

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.323
My friend, you smell.

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:13.164
Huh.

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:30.041
Ugh!

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:32.567
Accidents will screw me
every time.

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.484
Better.

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:49.402
Here.

01:00:58.480 --> 01:00:59.891
Beautiful.

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:03.044
Yeah. My daughter.

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:08.610
My wife told her I'm dead.

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.362
Then you should forget her.

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:25.849
How is dish?

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.490
Sorry?

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:31.087
How is stolen candy dish?
You liking it?

01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:33.686
- Hmm? Big Swarovski fan?
- Oh.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:37.004
<i>' -_</i>

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:39.970
I can bring that back.

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:42.885
Beh. It broke.

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:46.724
Clumsy carpet cleaners
knocked it over on exit.

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:39.971
Have a great holiday.

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:42.600
Excuse me, which one do you like?
Do you like this one or this one?

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.762
Both.

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:46.649
Hey, what the hell is going on?

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:48.768
They came.
I told you it would happen.

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:51.446
Today is the day.
The rush is on.

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:52.721
- I will take this one.
- Ah.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:55.201
You make homeless tree very happy.

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:56.566
Do you need me to trim
those branches?

01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:57.846
No, I like it just the way it is.

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:00.441
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Okay. Thank you.

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.568
I've got a question.
I've got these two enormous

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.290
- vintage cherubs, very heavy.
- Okay.

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:07.489
- I need a very strong tree.
- Ah, yeah. Dennis.

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:10.211
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Dennis is expert,

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.010
- herbalist professional.
- Okay.

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:14.640
He can answer any question
you might have, scientific.

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:16.529
Scotch... the needles

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:18.569
- radiate out from the branches.
- Mm-hmm.

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:20.324
It's very strong.
Sharp needles, though.

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:22.204
- Do you have children in the house?
- No.

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.687
Because you don't want them
grabbing the things.

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:26.649
Why don't you just give me $200

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.531
and take whatever tree
you want, okay?

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:31.489
- Great. You help yourself, okay?
- This one?

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:33.449
Yes, ma'am.
Any one you want. Very good.

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:34.681
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:36.763
- There's got to be about 1,500 there.
- No shit.

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:38.604
- Put it in the box.
- Okay.

01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:40.330
Where did you get those clothes?

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:43.283
Some dentist.

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:52.049
<i>He'! '</i>

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:54.168
Marie, how...?

01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:56.561
Wow, it's g...
it's good to hear your voice.

01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:00.201
Look, if you're calling
about this month's...

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.047
Yeah?

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:04.804
Really?

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.890
Congratulations.

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:10.884
Yeah, I'll sign
whatever you need me to sign.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:15.086
No, I'm... I'm...
this is... I'm pleased for...

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:16.730
hello?

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:28.407
Marie is giving me a divorce.

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:38.409
I didn't even take her
on a honeymoon.

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:49.284
Delivery?

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:52.523
Hi. Could you find that nice
French Canadian man?

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:55.763
He told me when I found
my perfect tree, he'd wrap it for me.

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:02.050
I'm very, very sorry, sir.

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:03.929
It'll just be another
five minutes, okay?

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:09.449
God damn it.

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:19.641
- Here.
- Huh?

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:22.371
Oh, no, thanks.
Not right now. Thanks.

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:24.767
Hey. Shit. God damn it.

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:26.126
- Hey!
- Hi.

01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:28.009
- Hi.
- How much?

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:30.811
Uh, 5O bucks.

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:34.640
Hey, you know, it cost a lot
to get them down here.

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:36.882
- I want a tree, Mama.
- Shh.

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:42.084
Um, okay, come on. Let's go.

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:43.651
No, I want a tree, Mama.

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:45.290
Come on, let's go.

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:47.090
Sorry.

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:51.041
You have heart like Putin.

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.721
You're the one who told me
what to charge.

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:58.168
What to charge the haves,
like dentists.

01:05:58.320 --> 01:05:59.685
Habs?

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:01.171
Haves.

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:03.971
I have this. I have that.

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:06.646
I have tickets to Knicks game.

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:08.006
I have everything.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.083
I have Dolce & Gabbana
underwears.

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:18.680
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:20.842
Yeah.

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:24.002
That should be on there.

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:26.447
Here.

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:29.365
Thank you.

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.522
Merry Christmas.

01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:34.170
Christ loves you!

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:36.800
He loves you,
each and every one.

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.883
There you go.

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:42.169
It's bare. You know, you can trim
the bottom off a little bit there.

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:50.441
Okay.

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:07.242
Fuck you very much.

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:23.124
Five trees...

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:27.251
50, 50, 50, 150, 172.

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:30.004
That's all the guy had.

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:42.282
Thanks, Nzomo.

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:46.764
If I need you tomorrow night,
I'll let you know.

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:48.445
Okay?

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:23.041
Hello.

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:25.004
Christ.

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:28.170
I knew it. And why are you
answering his phone?

01:08:28.319 --> 01:08:30.402
Uh, he's not feeling well.

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:33.483
- Is he all right?
- Yeah.

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:35.961
It's just some kind of,
you know, sickness.

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:38.042
Well, put him on the phone.

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.805
He's... he's sleeping.

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:43.008
All right, well, have him call me
when he wakes up.

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:44.810
Hey, how is she?

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:46.609
She's fine.

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:50.082
You should really
put her out of your mind.

01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:52.129
Your parole officer called here.

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:55.361
Oh, really?
Did you tell him I was dead?

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:57.602
No, I told him you were working.

01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:01.321
He said, "You're kidding,"
and to wish you a merry Christmas.

01:09:01.479 --> 01:09:04.006
You know, if you get Rene
into some kind of trouble...

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:07.727
Therese, Therese,
I told you I'm straight.

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:09.689
And you should really
think about that.

01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:11.524
Just have him call me
when he wakes up.

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:22.170
Hey!

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:24.969
Hey!

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.566
Merry Christmas, tree man.

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.728
Rene!

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:13.442
- Still sick.
- Oh, you're lying.

01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:15.608
- Terry.
- You always say "Terry"

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:17.125
when you're lying to me.

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:19.123
Why would I lie for him?

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:26.287
He just needs to sleep it off.

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:33.641
You know, the bottoms
on these kinds of firs...

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:35.210
they... they droop sometimes.

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:37.567
You have to trim them.

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:42.402
Right, I owe you 25.
Let me see.

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:53.682
We may have moved
into the land of 45/55.

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:56.047
Okay.

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:57.361
All right.

01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:59.568
- Merry Christmas.
- Same to you.

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:01.848
- Sorry about that.
- Merry Christmas.

01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:05.089
He's a bit, you know,
under the weather.

01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:07.641
- You got that?
- Bye.

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:11.361
Don't put any sugar
in the water, okay?

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:13.488
It's not gonna help.
The tree's dead already.

01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:15.364
Oh, look who's here.

01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:18.528
You know, I should
inventory the trees again.

01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:20.887
I haven't done the count
in, like, two days.

01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:22.883
And I swear we're running short
a few grand.

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:25.771
Do you have any idea how we could be
running short a few grand?

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:30.008
Oh, no.

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:34.366
- How did you pay for it?
- I didn't steal it.

01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:37.251
I know you didn't steal it,
because I didn't steal it for you.

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:38.731
- I bought it.
- With whose money?

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:40.681
- My money.
- Where the hell did you get that?

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:45.930
Oh, for Chri...
this is not your money.

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:49.084
This is not anybody's money
until we were d...

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:51.083
- you stole it.
- No.

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:53.368
- Oh, yes, you did.
- No.

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:56.046
- Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
- No, no. No, no, no. No.

01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:58.931
All you said... all you said
was that I keep the records

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:00.081
and you keep the key.

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:01.241
I don't need a key.

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:03.243
- We need a tree.
- A good one, yo.

01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:05.841
- Yeah? Big or small?
- Uh...

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.161
Hey, why did you tell her
I was sick?

01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:10.967
She didn't know where you were,
so I made something up.

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.645
For her, not for you.

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:14.450
Ha! Not for you!

01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:16.921
- A fake-looking tree would be good.
- How do you do it?

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:18.406
As fake and as perfect-looking
as possible.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:19.846
- I mean, seriously.
- Do what?

01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:21.405
- Get away with it all.
- Dennis.

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:23.767
I'd like a medium-sized one,
you know,

01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:26.611
- with perfect proportions.
- Pamela Anderson.

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:27.921
- Exactly.
- Oh.

01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:29.320
- I got the tree. Come on.
- How... how...?

01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:30.481
- Come on.
- How do you get away with all this

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.962
- goddamn wonder, innocent bullshit...
- Oh, you know...

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:36.805
goddamn
fluffy-bunny-rabbit crap?

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:41.124
I cannot believe anybody buys it,
let alone my own fucking wife!

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:42.850
You know what, Dennis?
I took it pretty good

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.490
when you hit me in the face
back in Quebec.

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:46.483
I bought you a drink,
if I remember correctly.

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:48.290
I didn't say anything
when you wanted to come down.

01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:50.130
I understand. You need cash.

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:52.607
But I'll tell you something...
I'm gonna marry Therese.

01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:54.285
I told you.
I told you that the whole time.

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:56.329
- Thief.
- What, did you think I was kidding?

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:58.642
Guys, sorry about the drama.
Come here.

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:00.848
- Check this one out.
- Thief.

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:03.441
Thief.

01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:07.290
How about this?

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:09.727
- I like it.
- I'm kind of turned on.

01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:11.241
- Thief!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:12.566
- Fucking...
- Take it easy.

01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:14.888
- What's your problem, pal?
- What is wrong with you?

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:17.168
- He stole my wife.
- What?

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:19.288
- Is that true?
- I'm marrying her.

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:21.010
- Aww.
- That's fucked up.

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:22.810
He was in prison for four years.

01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:24.640
I was looking out for her.
Things happened.

01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:27.081
Yo, you stole his woman
while he was in the joint.

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:28.924
- That's even more fucked up.
- Right.

01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:31.162
And... and he doesn't
even miss her.

01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:34.807
He goes out for three days at a time
and he doesn't even miss her.

01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:36.371
Of course I miss her.

01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:38.568
Oh, yeah? How much? Hmm?

01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:40.848
How... wh...? Uh, would you...

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.844
would you endure a dull pain

01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:46.407
24 hours a day
for the rest of your life

01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:49.006
to make her appear here
right now?

01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:51.841
What, are you 10?

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.570
Would you... would you give up

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:55.882
whatever money we're gonna make

01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:57.724
to see her here right now?

01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:59.564
I'm bringing
the money home for her,

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:02.001
- and for Michi, you idiot.
- Would you...?

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:04.208
And a ring to marry her.
That's the point of all of this.

01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:06.567
Would you... would you cut off
your own arm and feet

01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:08.324
to see her here right now

01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:11.410
and... and maybe hold her
in the leftover arm

01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:13.403
for, like, 10 seconds

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:15.562
and just lay your face

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:17.563
against the right side
of her neck?

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:19.688
Wait, what?

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:23.162
What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:25.322
See? You see?

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:31.126
- You don't deserve her.
- Oh, and you do, huh?

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:33.123
What about her?
Does she have any say in this?

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:36.762
Does Therese deserve somebody
who makes every single person

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:38.922
feel 10 times worse?

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:42.481
I'll tell you something...
I don't blame her.

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:44.444
No wonder she couldn't
take it anymore.

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:46.881
Hey, hey, hey, easy, easy.

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:48.610
- Not worth it.
- Not worth it.

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:13.126
I'm not buying a tree
from this lout.

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:18.929
How much do you want
for the tree?

01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:22.926
That's... that's a Scotch pine.
$200.

01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:24.889
$200? There you go.

01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:27.211
Don't give him any, all right?

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:29.283
Yeah, bro, and get your wife back.

01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:31.721
Do whatever it takes.
You get her back.

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:33.041
- Okay.
- All right?

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:34.645
- You want me to mesh that up for you?
- No, I'm good.

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:37.565
I like her how she is, man.
She's perfect. Thanks, bro.

01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:38.846
Dick.

01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:46.091
Hello?

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:47.924
I'd like to buy a Christmas tree.

01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:49.690
What kind?

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:52.969
One that doesn't look like
it was bought by a blind guy.

01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:07.121
- Operator.
- Collect call.

01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:09.567
- Your party's name?
- Therese.

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:11.324
Your name?

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:12.521
Dennis.

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:18.600
I have a collect call
from Dennis.

01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:20.360
Do you accept the charges?

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:23.404
Uh...

01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:24.891
D'accord. Maman!

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:34.520
Do you accept...

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:36.329
All right, Therese, just listen.

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:38.960
Just listen to me, all right?
And don't say a word.

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:42.044
- Um...
- Madame, do you accept the charges?

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:45.443
Hey, it's snowing here.

01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:48.171
The whole scene out here...
it looks like...

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:50.920
- Sir, she must accept the charges.
- Like a... like a snow globe,

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.287
you know, when you shake it up.

01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:54.845
- Man!
- Madame, do you accept the charges?

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.843
Hold on! And, um, the...

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.207
I'll have to disconnect
unless the charges are accepted.

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:01.880
Um, the whole thing... it looks like
one of those snow globes,

01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:04.725
- you know, with...
- Sir, I am sorry. I have to disconnect.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.684
That's it?

01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:39.170
Yes?

01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:43.368
Well, Olga...

01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:47.404
turns out that God blesses
the liars and cheaters.

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.325
And?

01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:58.966
What the fuck are you doing?

01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:01.202
No. You quit.

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:03.522
It is bullshit like this, huh?

01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:04.886
Mm.

01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:07.450
Yeah.

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:14.642
You've not got much, you know?

01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:18.930
No wife.

01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:23.809
No kid.

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:25.928
No job.

01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:28.208
You should keep lungs, yeah?

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:45.005
You hungry?

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:46.400
Hmm?

01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:49.564
Let me see what I got for you.

01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:53.688
What I got in here?

01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:55.842
Ah, I got borscht. Very good.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.161
Not too thick

01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:00.529
like bullshit passing
for borscht in America.

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:04.161
I do egg salad.

01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:06.806
I eat at least one egg every day.

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.129
Hey! No!

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:13.644
Egg salad? Yes or no, huh?

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:15.802
- No, thank you.
- Okay!

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:20.521
Okay,

01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:22.762
then what do we do
for you, huh?

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:27.961
You know where I can
find a piano?

01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:32.210
Yeah.

01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:41.490
That... that is Yamaha.

01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:45.211
- Responsive keys, yeah.
- Oh.

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:49.371
And Baldwin... nice tone,
but costs big dinero.

01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:50.521
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:52.728
- Are they always white like that?
- No.

01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:54.041
Okay.

01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:55.810
Olga.

01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:58.486
Vlad!

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:04.084
<i>He'! '.</i>

01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:08.846
We both grew up near Gdansk,
but we met at a wedding in Queens.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.206
Oh.

01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:13.205
Nice to meet you.

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:16.762
Um, sorry, what...

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:19.400
what's the cheapest one
that you got?

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:21.329
We have uprights in the back.

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:23.443
- Oh. Can I see them?
- Of course.

01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:29.929
I think I stay here

01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:31.844
for a little bit.

01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:01.843
She hates diamonds.

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:04.365
What?

01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:06.727
Therese... she doesn't
like diamonds.

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:13.568
She says you're a lousy listener.

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:19.522
She hates diamonds?

01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:23.122
She likes rubies.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.162
Where did you get that shirt?

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.207
Broadway Shirts.

01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:50.242
Rise and shine, cocksucker.

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:52.289
I do well! Here we go. Okay.

01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:54.329
Anything you like,
you see, this is...

01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:56.761
oh, I got tree... I got tree for you...
this one right here.

01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:59.320
This is a strong,
is a masculine...

01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:01.164
this is man tree.

01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:03.004
The trees, you know...
they have a gender.

01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:05.288
They have man tree,
woman tree. You can tell.

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:08.091
Same with the... the snow bank.

01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:09.810
There you go.

01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:12.645
You have a wonderful,
wonderful Christmas, eh?

01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:15.644
Okay, bye.

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:17.290
Olga;

01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:19.442
Oh. Hey.

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:22.683
Uh-huh.

01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:27.283
It's tradition
on first day of winter

01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:30.649
to raise toast...
three months of night.

01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:42.170
- Oh.
- Ah.

01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:44.163
Yeah. " Mm!"

01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:48.242
Tomorrow?

01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:52.289
The day after.

01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:54.645
Mm.

01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:58.282
For the FYI, I do not...

01:24:58.440 --> 01:24:59.930
say good-bye.

01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:06.207
I also do not say hello.

01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:13.046
Thanks.

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:19.410
- Sergei Gonchar.
- Guy Lafleur.

01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:21.244
- Vladislav Tretiak.
- Phil Esposito.

01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:22.970
- Vladislav Tretiak.
- Bobby Hull.

01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:25.009
- Bernie Parent.
- Vladislav...

01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:27.891
- Sidney Crosby.
- Vladislav...

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.769
- Gordie Howe.
- Alexei Kovalev.

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:31.524
- Mario Lemieux.
- Igor Larionov.

01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:34.524
- Uh, Maxim...
- Bobby Orr.

01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:36.444
And in the sky.

01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:40.002
The larks,
still bravely singing, fly.

01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:43.004
Scarce heard
amid the guns below.

01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:47.047
We are the dead,

01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:49.447
Short days ago.

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:52.763
We lived, felt dawn

01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:55.247
saw sunset glow,

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:58.927
- Loved and were loved...
- Tell... tell me his name again.

01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:00.923
- Rene.
- And now we lie In Flanders Fields.

01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:03.367
No, this... here.

01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:04.885
Oh, yeah.

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:06.644
- Nzomo.
- I use something like that...

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:08.802
- Nzomo?
- ...for a comedic monologue...

01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:10.480
- Nzomo.
- ...for a class I'm taking...

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:11.891
- Nzomo.
- I think.

01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:13.841
- ...at the Queens Community College.
- Nzomo.

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:15.610
- Yeah.
- Salud, Nzomo!

01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:17.649
- Acting. Hey.
- Right on.

01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:19.564
Hey, salud.

01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:23.127
- Maybe?
- Mmm.

01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:32.081
Oh, man.

01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:41.724
I'm going home.
I'm going to the subway.

01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:43.490
- You going?
- I go.

01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:44.971
- You 9Q?
- Where you go?

01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:46.565
To the train

01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:49.366
to Jamaica, Queens.

01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:53.688
I like it here.

01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:55.808
Therese hates cities.

01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:58.611
I was always trying to get her
to move to Montreal.

01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:01.127
You can move there.

01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:03.004
I'm on parole.

01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:06.448
Oh, yeah.
How long does that last?

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:08.602
Years.

01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:17.207
I think Marie hates me.

01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:19.727
You hate that...
when people hate you?

01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:22.287
Everyone hates it
when people hate them.

01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:24.442
Never bothered me.

01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:31.962
How are you gonna stay dead
in Massey?

01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:35.044
I can't stay dead, Rene.

01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:37.726
Yeah. It does seem hard.

01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:39.962
I got a present picked out for Michi.

01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:43.642
Maybe you could, uh,

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:46.485
stay in Marie's basement,
you know,

01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:48.768
till you find something
more permanent.

01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:58.448
Okay.

01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:02.002
$20,768.

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:04.970
That's a lot of up-and-up cash.

01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:07.521
- I told you it would be fine.
- Yeah.

01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:09.569
And it is.

01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:12.286
It is fine.

01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:14.488
Oh, this is gonna change things.

01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:16.842
- Everything.
- Mmm.

01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:20.842
Maybe I'll take Res to Jamaica.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.367
She's never seen the sea.

01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:29.724
What are you gonna get?

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:35.169
Hello?

01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:38.130
It's the blind man
who bought a tree from you.

01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:47.009
Hey, man. Oh!
Oh, you're kidding.

01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:48.685
Back away from the money.

01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:50.769
- I said back away from it!
- Fuck you.

01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:53.651
- You don't want to do this.
- Go fuck yourself!

01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:55.723
- I will kill you!
- Go fuck yourself!

01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:57.803
- If you want me to, I will!
- Go ahead!

01:28:57.960 --> 01:28:59.803
It's Christmas. Nobody shoots
anybody at Christmas.

01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:02.531
- Go fuck yourself!
- Dennis, give him the box.

01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:04.887
- I'll blow your goddamn head off!
- Go fuck yourself!

01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:07.407
Denn...

01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:10.131
Take it! Take it! Just take it.

01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:13.490
Just take it.

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:21.407
Now go fuck yourself.

01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:26.130
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:28.282
Holy Chri...

01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:31.880
Oh.

01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:33.804
- Are you okay?
- Me? Yeah.

01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:37.965
- Oh, thank God.
- Jesus Christ, what about you?

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:40.929
That guy wasn't blind.

01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:46.084
No shit.

01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:47.651
All right, all right, all right.

01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:49.723
- It was in the box.
- Huh?

01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:51.962
- The ring.
- Okay.

01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:54.566
- The ring was in the box.
- All right.

01:29:57.520 --> 01:29:59.284
- It was in the box.
- I know.

01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:01.568
- Dennis.
- You're all right.

01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:06.008
- Dennis, the ring...
- Rene, come on.

01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:07.969
- It was in the box.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:10.441
- God damn! I can't!
- Hey!

01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:13.251
- The trees are innocent, man.
- I can't go home with nothing!

01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:15.528
- The trees are blameless, man.
- God damn it.

01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:17.529
I can't leave with nothing.

01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:30.881
I was this close.

01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:51.003
Hey.

01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:52.844
No.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.446
- You have to tell her.
- I can't. I don't know what to say.

01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:57.523
Since when?

01:30:57.720 --> 01:30:59.722
I'm the one that cheers her up.

01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:02.649
Right. Okay, then fuck it.
I'm gonna do that.

01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:04.689
No, don't. No, no, no.

01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:08.049
No.

01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:14.329
Hey. What are you...
how are you?

01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:16.960
Rene, I'm so happy
to hear your voice.

01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:18.929
Oh.

01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:21.560
Uh, yeah, yours...

01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:23.245
yours too.

01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:25.243
Are you okay?

01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:26.526
Yeah.

01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:30.407
- Rene?
- Yes. Yeah. Um...

01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:32.449
Yeah, there's something
I have to tell you.

01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:34.841
Uh...

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.401
we were robbed.

01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:41.522
Christ, Rene.

01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:49.285
Rene.

01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:52.722
Just come home.

01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:57.048
Just come home.

01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:25.726
Hi.

01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:26.881
What?

01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:28.690
No.

01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:30.729
- It's the only way.
- No.

01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:34.411
Even if I thought okay,
no, they're back,

01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:36.722
the dentists,
from Hole of Jackson.

01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:38.723
I thought you said that they were gone
till after the holiday.

01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:41.724
It is their house. If they want
to come back, they come back.

01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:46.611
Okay, well, then we're just gonna
have to do it after they're asleep.

01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:49.445
Believe me,
I hate these dentists.

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:52.843
Want to know Merry Christmas
I get from them?

01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:55.644
"Oh, Olga, we're going
to fix your teeth

01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:58.889
so they look like teeth of Vanna White
from 'Fortune's Wheel."'

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:01.008
Do they ever fix
Olga's teeth? No.

01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:03.083
They ski slalom
in Hole of Jackson.

01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:06.050
Believe me,
I hate these fucking dentists,

01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:07.725
but, yeah...

01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:12.728
You must have Russian blood.

01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:16.564
- Why?
- You do what you must.

01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:21.529
I'll leave back window open.

01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:23.648
It is not on grid.

01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:37.723
Just do everything
I tell you to do, like you used to.

01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:40.247
Dennis, I swore to her.

01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:42.926
I swo... I swore to...
you did too.

01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:45.321
Yeah, that was before
we got robbed of every last dollar.

01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:47.001
You really want
to go back with nothing?

01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:49.407
No, no, no, no.
But I can't lie to her.

01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:53.445
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm threatening to kill you

01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:55.085
unless you help me.

01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:57.766
And that way,
it'll all be on me.

01:35:57.920 --> 01:35:59.649
My fault.

01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:05.289
Man, that's...

01:36:57.600 --> 01:36:58.647
Wow.

01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:01.167
She regularly let you in here?

01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:04.288
That's a testament, man.

01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:07.648
This place is nice.

01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:08.887
Maybe she liked you.

01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:10.724
Shh, shh, shh.

01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:34.001
No, no, no, no.
Don't touch that.

01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:37.124
How do you expect me
to get in if I...?

01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:39.203
We're not stealing that.

01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:42.242
We're stealing this.

01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:46.729
You brought me here
to steal a fucking piano?

01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:49.446
Shh, shh, shh. Yeah.

01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:52.080
How much... how much
do you love jail?

01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:54.049
No. Do you remember
that Sorel job?

01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:56.168
It's gonna be easy.
Remember that?

01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:58.243
We got the whole safe out.

01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:04.850
You are a dumb, dumb fuckhead.

01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:07.844
Find your own way home.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.889
I promised her one.

01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:11.485
Who?

01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:14.564
Michi.

01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:18.285
You talked to her?

01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:21.482
In my head.

01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:25.290
I promised Michi a piano
in my head.

01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:32.006
Steady, steady, steady.

01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:37.244
Got it?

01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:40.970
Hold on. Hold on.

01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:58.288
Fu...

01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:09.727
Merry Christmas.

01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:13.524
Come on.

01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:22.725
I just think it's a really
personal decision, though,

01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:25.531
if you go with an epidural
or you have a natural childbirth.

01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:28.843
You know, as long as the baby
is born, I suppose.

01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:31.088
I read this one thing...
is it Scientology?

01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:33.527
Where they have a baby in water.

01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:35.409
And they don't scream.

01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:38.211
So that the baby
isn't brought into the world

01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:41.728
with any kind of negative energy
or ions.

01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:51.731
Signs of forced entry.

01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:54.008
Looks like there might be
some footprints in the courtyard.

01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:55.571
We don't know yet.

01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:57.927
The piano is obviously missing.

01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:00.560
We've got furniture in disarray.

01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:02.245
And...

01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:06.246
oh, oh, there's books
that are stacked in, like...

01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:08.562
- can I help you?
- I work here.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:13.368
We've got books stacked in piles...
