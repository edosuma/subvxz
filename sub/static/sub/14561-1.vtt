WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:02.503
Previously on Numb3rs...

00:02.570 --> 00:04.004
WOMAN: Charlie, you have
to read these letters.

00:04.072 --> 00:05.406
I found them in
the old wall secretary.

00:05.473 --> 00:07.308
I would be thrilled
to write one.

00:07.375 --> 00:08.709
You seem to be having
a real breakthrough.

00:08.776 --> 00:10.478
CHARLIE: Yeah, and then
my brother got stabbed.

00:10.544 --> 00:11.779
DON EPPES:
I'm back to full duty Monday.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.281
I plan to take it easy.

00:13.347 --> 00:14.782
CHARLIE: I know I
should write this letter.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.817
I just don't know
what the future holds.

00:16.884 --> 00:18.586
Will you marry me?

00:26.560 --> 00:30.464
* Echoes start as a cross
in you *

00:32.366 --> 00:36.470
* Trembling noises
that come too soon *

00:38.372 --> 00:43.744
* Spatial movement
which seems to you *

00:43.811 --> 00:47.381
* Resonating your mask or feud

00:47.448 --> 00:49.317
It's September, and I'm looking
at four letters,

00:49.383 --> 00:52.920
written by four of the greatest
minds of the 20th century.

00:52.986 --> 00:55.956
Hightower, Knox,
Newberry, Beiderman.

00:56.023 --> 00:59.793
Each one had this office
before me,

00:59.860 --> 01:01.362
and each one wrote a letter

01:01.429 --> 01:04.998
to the professor
who would come after.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.301
Now it's my turn.

01:07.368 --> 01:09.103
I'm writing a letter

01:09.170 --> 01:13.207
to the faceless,
nameless professor

01:13.274 --> 01:16.410
who will take this office
after me.

01:18.346 --> 01:20.414
CHARLIE:
Who are you?

01:23.484 --> 01:25.519
* And then you cut

01:26.954 --> 01:30.191
What questions
are you wrestling with?

01:31.091 --> 01:32.760
* You cut it out

01:35.529 --> 01:38.166
Where are you looking
for your answers?

01:38.232 --> 01:40.334
* And everything

01:46.340 --> 01:50.544
* Goes back to the beginning

01:50.611 --> 01:52.546
Do you take this office
at the end

01:52.613 --> 01:54.382
of a long
and distinguished career?

01:54.448 --> 01:56.550
* Silence seizes
a cluttered room *

01:56.617 --> 01:59.086
* Light is shed,
not a breath too soon *

01:59.153 --> 02:01.455
Or are you on the ascent--

02:01.522 --> 02:03.557
your greatest work
waiting for you

02:03.624 --> 02:06.059
amid an infinity
of possibilities?

02:06.126 --> 02:09.297
* Darkness rises in all you do

02:09.363 --> 02:11.465
* Standing and drawn
across the room... *

02:11.532 --> 02:13.967
Do you hover above the chaos,

02:14.034 --> 02:18.906
looking for your answers
in patterns and trends,

02:18.972 --> 02:22.343
or do you need to be
at ground level,

02:22.410 --> 02:24.011
walking through the problem?

02:24.077 --> 02:27.348
-Hey.
-Hey.

02:27.415 --> 02:28.949
COLBY: Looks like you jumped
the gun, Charlie.

02:29.016 --> 02:30.451
-Nobody's been shot yet.
-I know, but, uh,

02:30.518 --> 02:31.652
Don said that you guys

02:31.719 --> 02:34.121
were doing VIP security
for a big rally,

02:34.188 --> 02:36.990
and I figured I'd slap together
some, uh, crowd flux dynamics,

02:37.057 --> 02:39.960
a dash of covering sets,
TГіth it all up a spanning tree.

02:41.229 --> 02:43.197
G.... G. Fejes TГіth

02:43.264 --> 02:44.565
and, uh, L. Fejes TГіth--

02:44.632 --> 02:46.434
they're the leading
authorities on, uh...

02:46.500 --> 02:47.635
on covering sets.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.503
I told you-- it's not funny.

02:49.570 --> 02:50.538
You know, in certain circles,

02:50.604 --> 02:52.373
I am considered
to be really funny.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.375
FBI circles?

02:54.442 --> 02:56.877
-Who's the VIP?
-Benjamin Polk.

02:56.944 --> 02:58.178
CHARLIE: The, uh,
political family?

02:58.246 --> 03:00.414
Yeah, Benjamin's the apple that
fell off your spanning tree.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.350
This guy walked away
from a trust fund to be,

03:02.416 --> 03:03.351
uh, one of these people

03:03.417 --> 03:05.219
that just protests
just about everything.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.321
COLBY:
Caused a riot in Portland

03:07.388 --> 03:08.756
during the 2005
Trade negotiations.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.358
You know, a lot of people
in New Orleans

03:10.424 --> 03:11.559
said he was a hero
during Katrina.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.261
I mean, he brought in food

03:13.327 --> 03:14.928
to neighborhoods
that the cops abandoned.

03:14.995 --> 03:16.430
I'm not exactly sure
what he is,

03:16.497 --> 03:18.499
except our problem
for the next few days.

03:18.566 --> 03:20.634
This place is a nightmare
from a security standpoint.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.169
I mean, there are a zillion

03:22.236 --> 03:23.237
good sniper positions.

03:23.304 --> 03:24.738
There is no way to control entry

03:24.805 --> 03:26.240
and exit from the park.

03:26.307 --> 03:28.676
For our purposes, th-that's
where crowd flux can help.

03:28.742 --> 03:32.513
You know, the same algorithms
that are used to keep your car

03:32.580 --> 03:34.648
at a steady speed
when you're on cruise control

03:34.715 --> 03:36.384
can be applied
to the flow of people

03:36.450 --> 03:38.185
coming in and out
of a rally area.

03:38.252 --> 03:41.289
And you guys remember when
we used covering sets, right?

03:41.355 --> 03:42.723
Yeah, that was
the fishing net, right?

03:42.790 --> 03:45.359
No, I think fishing net...
no, brute force--

03:45.426 --> 03:46.460
could've been our fireworks.

03:46.527 --> 03:48.296
You guys, this is the dog
chasing the cat,

03:48.362 --> 03:49.430
-chasing the mouse.
-It was lighthouses.

03:49.497 --> 03:51.599
I made an analogy to the
positioning of lighthouses.

03:51.665 --> 03:52.500
(gunshots)

03:52.566 --> 03:54.968
DON:
Get down! Get down!

03:55.035 --> 03:57.137
-DAVID: Everybody stay down!
-(crowd screaming)

03:57.204 --> 03:58.772
-DON: You all right?
-DAVID: 60-74 to Control,

03:58.839 --> 04:00.007
we have sniper fire

04:00.073 --> 04:01.842
in MacArthur Park,
vicinity of the band shell.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.377
DON: Colby, you see
anything over there?

04:03.444 --> 04:05.446
(gunshots)

04:05.513 --> 04:07.781
Sounded like a .308--
semiauto fire, so maybe an M1A1.

04:07.848 --> 04:10.818
Okay. What's the muzzle velocity
on an M1A1?

04:10.884 --> 04:14.288
-Like 700-800?
-853 meters per second.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.824
Effective range of 460 meters.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.326
CHARLIE: That accounts
for a roughly...

04:18.392 --> 04:20.093
(gunshots)

04:20.160 --> 04:21.695
...quarter second delay.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.964
Wind's out of the southeast--
what, at ten miles an hour?

04:24.031 --> 04:25.065
Maybe 15.

04:25.132 --> 04:27.468
Angle of declination--
assuming a male--

04:27.535 --> 04:29.403
national average height of
at least five-foot-nine...

04:29.470 --> 04:30.404
DON:
In the trees!

04:30.471 --> 04:32.373
David, moving.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.342
-Covering!
-(gunshots)

04:36.176 --> 04:39.146
(gunshots)

04:39.212 --> 04:40.314
When I make my move,

04:40.381 --> 04:42.149
you just make your way
to the band shell, okay?

04:42.215 --> 04:46.454
(gunshots)

04:46.520 --> 04:48.556
(rapid gunfire)

04:50.458 --> 04:53.361
(gunfire continues)

04:55.396 --> 04:56.964
(tires squealing)

05:00.568 --> 05:03.637
(gunshots, tires squealing)

05:11.945 --> 05:13.714
(tires screeching)

05:16.617 --> 05:19.553
(cell phone ringing)

05:24.024 --> 05:25.025
MAN (on phone):
LAPD?

05:25.092 --> 05:26.427
DON (on phone):
FBI.

05:26.494 --> 05:28.195
You want to tell me
what that was all about?

05:28.261 --> 05:29.229
That was fair warning.

05:29.296 --> 05:30.464
Don't get between Benjamin Polk

05:30.531 --> 05:32.466
and the bullet
with his name on it.

05:41.875 --> 05:44.878
My mother had this photo
of the Parthenon

05:44.945 --> 05:48.315
from a trip she'd taken with
my father before I was born.

05:48.382 --> 05:50.350
And one day, I, uh...

05:50.418 --> 05:52.986
I scribbled all over it
with a crayon.

05:53.053 --> 05:56.189
She was understandably upset
until my Dad pointed out

05:56.256 --> 05:59.893
that I had covered it with
rectangles within rectangles,

05:59.960 --> 06:03.030
retracing the Greeks' use
of the golden ratio.

06:03.096 --> 06:05.298
Does that speak
to the mathematician's need

06:05.365 --> 06:06.734
to understand beauty

06:06.800 --> 06:09.169
or to the child's need
to tear it apart?

06:09.236 --> 06:12.005
MAN: People don't want to admit
that the government's broken.

06:12.072 --> 06:13.306
That's a big idea.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.675
It's a scary idea.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.544
This turnout makes me happy,
but it makes them nervous.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.579
Change starts today!

06:18.646 --> 06:20.581
The government has an interest

06:20.648 --> 06:21.849
in keeping you comfortable,

06:21.915 --> 06:25.118
in keeping you
from asking questions.

06:25.185 --> 06:29.623
They can gas us, they can club
us, they cannot ignore us!

06:29.690 --> 06:31.158
We don't espouse violence.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.626
I'm not resisting!

06:32.693 --> 06:35.062
The hard reality
is that confrontation

06:35.128 --> 06:36.864
is the most effective way

06:36.930 --> 06:38.766
of shaking people out
of their stupor.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.934
(continues low and indistinct)

06:44.705 --> 06:47.274
I get a dozen death threats
every week.

06:47.340 --> 06:49.543
The right hates me because
I'm a Commie pinko agitator.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.844
The left hates me
because I'm a sellout.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.113
This threat was backed up
with gunfire.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.348
He was smart enough
to shoot at the FBI

06:55.415 --> 06:56.617
and get away unidentified.

06:56.684 --> 06:58.652
You should be smart enough
to be concerned.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.688
Why? That's what I got
you guys for, right?

07:00.754 --> 07:01.689
DON:
No, we can't guarantee

07:01.755 --> 07:03.524
your safety in that park.

07:03.591 --> 07:04.625
Let me guess.

07:04.692 --> 07:06.894
You want me to change
the location of the rally?

07:06.960 --> 07:09.563
Some airplane hangar
in the Valley

07:09.630 --> 07:11.031
or a warehouse in San Pedro?

07:11.098 --> 07:13.166
Only if you're worried
about getting shot.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.971
All right, let's get it
out in the open.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.809
You're wondering
if I was behind it.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.577
Some kind of PR stunt.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.646
Oh, you're capable of that.

07:25.713 --> 07:29.517
Probably too smart
to risk getting caught, but...

07:32.085 --> 07:35.322
I know that you
don't want to see

07:35.388 --> 07:39.059
past the guy who threw bricks
and talked revolution--

07:39.126 --> 07:41.161
maybe I don't
even blame you--

07:41.228 --> 07:44.464
but I'm not him anymore.

07:44.532 --> 07:48.669
Look, I was lucky enough
to survive my mistakes.

07:48.736 --> 07:50.904
Now I'm just trying
to convince people

07:50.971 --> 07:53.440
to turn over some of their time
to helping others.

07:53.507 --> 07:56.910
You guys give your whole lives
to that.

07:56.977 --> 08:02.182
I don't like a lot of the things
that this country has done,

08:02.249 --> 08:03.483
but I have nothing but respect

08:03.551 --> 08:05.619
for the people who risk
their lives for it.

08:06.987 --> 08:10.758
And the least that I can do
is risk my own.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.593
NIKKI: Is that a preview
of Tuesday's speech

08:12.660 --> 08:15.763
or, uh, just the long way around
to saying no?

08:17.731 --> 08:19.667
It's a little bit of both.

08:23.637 --> 08:27.207
Man talks a pretty word...
or seven.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.342
What do you think?

08:29.409 --> 08:30.711
Keep your eyes open.

08:30.778 --> 08:32.746
Stay with him.

08:32.813 --> 08:35.082
CHARLIE:
Don seemed... different.

08:35.148 --> 08:37.417
Uh, preoccupied.

08:37.484 --> 08:40.220
When he got in his car
to chase after that sniper,

08:40.287 --> 08:42.022
he hesitated.

08:42.089 --> 08:45.458
The expression on his face
was almost pained.

08:45.525 --> 08:48.328
You think maybe he hasn't fully
recovered from the stabbing?

08:48.395 --> 08:49.697
I think,
if he were hurting,

08:49.763 --> 08:50.864
he wouldn't let anybody know.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.600
Well, you know,
sooner or later,

08:52.666 --> 08:54.968
everyone slows down.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.169
Speaking
from personal experience?

08:56.236 --> 08:57.170
No.

08:58.105 --> 08:59.973
I'm the exception to the rule.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.675
And on the topic
of slowing down,

09:01.742 --> 09:03.476
I seemed to notice
the, uh, absence

09:03.543 --> 09:04.745
of a certain beautiful
young professor

09:04.812 --> 09:07.314
around the house
these past few days.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.582
What's going on, Charlie?

09:08.649 --> 09:09.950
I've been here the whole time.

09:10.017 --> 09:13.821
(chuckles) Amita has been
really busy, actually.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.989
She's just been incredibly busy
with classes.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.325
And I've been busy,
too, frankly.

09:18.391 --> 09:19.827
Busy time for busy people.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.528
You know, the least
challenging thing

09:21.595 --> 09:23.230
about being
Charlie Eppes's father

09:23.296 --> 09:25.699
is knowing when he is lying.

09:32.439 --> 09:34.274
It's a clean shot at the dais.

09:34.341 --> 09:35.709
A clean shot at us.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.144
Who do we have?

09:37.210 --> 09:38.612
A male, white--

09:38.679 --> 09:40.047
20s, 30s, 40s?

09:40.113 --> 09:41.281
No prints,

09:41.348 --> 09:42.215
uses burner phones.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.417
I mean, everything about
this guy says pro.

09:44.484 --> 09:47.354
Except for the fact that he shot
at us in the first place.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.455
Why even give himself away?

09:48.521 --> 09:51.158
Why not wait till the rally,
then take your shot?

09:51.224 --> 09:53.126
Maybe he was trying
to spook him.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.896
Polk's been shot at before,
beaten up by the cops.

09:55.963 --> 09:58.431
I don't think he's the kind
of guy that's going to flinch.

09:58.498 --> 10:00.968
All right, see, this is why
we don't talk politics.

10:01.034 --> 10:02.502
We're not talking
about politics, man.

10:02.569 --> 10:04.337
We're talking about a guy
who gets threatened

10:04.404 --> 10:06.473
every time he opens his mouth,
then he opens it anyway.

10:06.539 --> 10:08.776
I mean, my dictionary--
that's... that's brave.

10:08.842 --> 10:11.444
COLBY: There's just no way we
can cover every problem here.

10:11.511 --> 10:13.580
Forget about the buildings
surrounding the park.

10:13.647 --> 10:14.581
There's buildings behind those.

10:14.648 --> 10:15.849
It's like he was shooting at us

10:15.916 --> 10:16.984
to point out the obvious.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.887
Yeah, he was definitely
pointing out something.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.960
Any word from CERN?

10:27.027 --> 10:30.430
The Max Planck Institute
aimed a radio telescope

10:30.497 --> 10:33.667
at the particular cloud
in the middle of the Milky Way.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.969
They were looking
for amino acids.

10:36.036 --> 10:37.838
-Do you know what they found?
-Ethyl formate.

10:37.905 --> 10:41.141
Which happens to be
the same chemical

10:41.208 --> 10:43.744
that gives raspberries
their flavor.

10:43.811 --> 10:46.914
The Milky Way tastes
like raspberries.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.616
So, no word from CERN.

10:49.683 --> 10:51.218
No.

10:51.284 --> 10:54.354
I expect my invitation to the
Hadron Collider is coming soon.

10:54.421 --> 10:57.524
You have second thoughts about
spending six months in Geneva?

10:57.590 --> 10:59.292
Just thoughts.

10:59.359 --> 11:00.293
(phone beeps)

11:00.360 --> 11:03.530
And that is Charlie
asking for help

11:03.596 --> 11:05.398
with some aperiodic tiling.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.267
-You want to come with?
-Actually, I have some

11:07.334 --> 11:10.470
low density parity check code
that isn't writing itself.

11:10.537 --> 11:12.205
(laughing)

11:12.272 --> 11:14.107
I am going to make
an effort to leave

11:14.174 --> 11:15.608
without running, screaming
from the room.

11:15.675 --> 11:16.543
Why?

11:16.609 --> 11:19.913
Come on, that subtle yet
impossible to ignore breath

11:19.980 --> 11:21.782
followed by the
half-hearted evasion.

11:21.849 --> 11:24.952
This can only mean
one more chapter

11:25.018 --> 11:27.955
in the unending romantic
serial of Charlie and Amita.

11:28.021 --> 11:31.591
And I have no desire
to reprise my supporting role.

11:31.658 --> 11:32.592
Larry...

11:32.659 --> 11:34.061
(shrieking, chuckling)

11:34.127 --> 11:35.128
No!

11:35.195 --> 11:36.163
(shrieking)

11:36.229 --> 11:38.598
You're a poor little
rich boy from what,

11:38.665 --> 11:40.600
four generations of politicians?

11:40.667 --> 11:42.770
It's kind of hard to generate
a populist message

11:42.836 --> 11:44.738
from your summer home
in Kennebunkport.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.439
So you throw on a flannel shirt,

11:46.506 --> 11:48.708
and you grab the mic
at a couple of our protests.

11:48.776 --> 11:50.710
Six years of being
gassed and clubbed

11:50.778 --> 11:52.813
doesn't sound that dilettante.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.047
He's played the part
longer than most,

11:54.114 --> 11:55.482
but what's he doing now?

11:55.548 --> 11:56.649
Fund-raiser luncheons,

11:56.716 --> 11:58.718
community center openings.

11:58.786 --> 12:00.153
Celebrity activists
always end up being

12:00.220 --> 12:01.588
more celebrity than activist.

12:01.654 --> 12:04.557
Yeah, 'cause there's nothing
worse than a community center.

12:04.624 --> 12:07.895
So he leaves your movement,
now you want to shut him up.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.763
We're planning
to exercise our rights

12:09.830 --> 12:11.765
to free speech
and lawful protest.

12:11.832 --> 12:15.135
You know, there are rumors
that Polk was an FBI informant.

12:15.202 --> 12:16.870
That's a good reason
to take a shot at him.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.138
And turn him into a martyr?

12:18.205 --> 12:20.640
We don't need to shoot Ben Polk.

12:20.707 --> 12:23.410
He's going to impale himself
on his own hypocrisy.

12:27.915 --> 12:30.517
If we move the barricades
back here and here,

12:30.583 --> 12:32.619
we're gonna maximize
Finger Effect

12:32.685 --> 12:34.321
and minimize edge crowding.

12:34.387 --> 12:36.756
So we'll have bomb dogs
and CTX units

12:36.824 --> 12:38.358
here, here and here.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.260
And then two aerial units,
one of ours, one of LAPD's.

12:40.327 --> 12:43.063
I'm more worried
about the snipers.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.865
We're going to cover
as many rooftops as we can.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.099
LARRY:
And hopefully we can help you

12:46.166 --> 12:47.200
pick the right rooftops.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.235
CHARLIE:
Of course, you realize

12:48.301 --> 12:49.436
this may be exactly
what he wants.

12:49.502 --> 12:52.806
Allocate more resources toward
counter-sniper tactics,

12:52.873 --> 12:55.242
leave ourselves vulnerable
somewhere else.

12:55.308 --> 12:58.611
Which presupposes a level
of guile and lucidity.

12:58.678 --> 13:00.080
Yeah, but a lot of these guys,

13:00.147 --> 13:01.849
they just get off
on one-upping the police

13:01.915 --> 13:04.051
and who they kill
is beside the point.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.552
LARRY:
Which presupposes

13:05.618 --> 13:06.954
a level of amorality.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.188
DON:
He could've waited,

13:08.255 --> 13:10.757
he could've taken his shot.

13:10.824 --> 13:12.459
But he leaves a phone,

13:12.525 --> 13:14.094
he warns us, he talks to us.

13:14.161 --> 13:16.396
Setting the rules.

13:16.463 --> 13:19.132
A prisoner knows
that he's going to be hanged

13:19.199 --> 13:21.268
and the hangman
tells him two things:

13:21.334 --> 13:23.904
That he's gonna be hanged
at dawn one day next week,

13:23.971 --> 13:26.006
and that it'll be a surprise.

13:26.073 --> 13:28.141
If the prisoner's alive
on Thursday,

13:28.208 --> 13:30.210
he can't be surprised on Friday

13:30.277 --> 13:32.712
and so he knows
he can't be hanged on Friday.

13:32.779 --> 13:34.214
And if he's alive on Wednesday,

13:34.281 --> 13:36.083
and he knows he can't
be hanged on Friday,

13:36.149 --> 13:37.784
then Thursday's out as well.

13:37.851 --> 13:39.953
So the reasoning
continues backwards.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.455
Wednesday, Tuesday, Monday.

13:42.522 --> 13:45.292
And the prisoner concludes
he's not gonna be hanged.

13:45.358 --> 13:47.094
The next week, the prisoner
is hanged anyway.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.795
Which is the surprise.

13:48.862 --> 13:51.731
So the prediction has come true
despite his reasoning.

13:51.798 --> 13:55.468
And that is called the
Unexpected Hanging Paradox.

13:55.535 --> 13:59.172
The rules we're hearing may
not be the rules he's setting.

13:59.239 --> 14:02.042
POLK: Two years ago,
I would have been

14:02.109 --> 14:04.544
out on the street,
screaming through a bullhorn,

14:04.611 --> 14:07.647
probably arranging for someone
in the kitchen to tamper

14:07.714 --> 14:08.916
with the hors d'oeuvres.

14:08.982 --> 14:10.918
I believed
that being prosperous meant

14:10.984 --> 14:12.652
you couldn't appreciate
the problems

14:12.719 --> 14:14.187
of the less prosperous.

14:14.254 --> 14:17.557
That compassion couldn't exist
without suffering.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.459
I was wrong.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.428
Prosperity does not
make you evil,

14:21.494 --> 14:25.665
but it can blind you
to the way other people live.

14:25.732 --> 14:28.101
Children go hungry in East L.A.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.637
Honest people are denied justice

14:30.703 --> 14:33.773
every day on the same streets
that you speed past.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.208
But tomorrow night,

14:35.275 --> 14:37.110
we're going to come together
in MacArthur Park.

14:37.177 --> 14:40.480
We will embrace sacrifice

14:40.547 --> 14:42.983
and decency, the most
fundamental of American...

14:43.050 --> 14:44.751
-(loud, explosive popping)
-Down!

14:44.817 --> 14:47.254
(people screaming and shouting)

14:50.723 --> 14:53.961
(explosive popping continues)

14:59.266 --> 15:00.934
-(popping stops)
-LIZ: All clear.

15:04.871 --> 15:06.673
Firecracker.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.476
(phone ringing)

15:10.577 --> 15:12.445
Call our techs,

15:12.512 --> 15:14.681
see if you can get
a triangulation.

15:18.518 --> 15:19.719
Hello?

15:19.786 --> 15:21.354
MAN:
I would've thought that

15:21.421 --> 15:23.423
this morning would have bought
me a little more credibility.

15:23.490 --> 15:26.759
Room full of windows,
no extra security.

15:26.826 --> 15:27.961
I counted five agents,

15:28.028 --> 15:30.097
assuming
the African-American woman

15:30.163 --> 15:31.931
with the fast reflexes
was one of yours.

15:31.999 --> 15:33.967
Five agents doesn't seem...

15:34.034 --> 15:37.337
you know, respectful
of my intentions.

15:37.404 --> 15:39.772
DAVID: We are... we are
taking you very seriously.

15:39.839 --> 15:41.975
You have my word on that.

15:42.042 --> 15:45.845
Listen, my name is
David Sinclair, okay?

15:45.912 --> 15:47.947
You are...?

15:50.017 --> 15:51.251
Not yet.

15:51.318 --> 15:53.720
Soon enough, but not yet.

15:53.786 --> 15:54.854
Okay, well, is, uh...

15:54.921 --> 15:57.624
Is there something
you'd like me to call you?

15:58.791 --> 16:00.160
(laughs)

16:00.227 --> 16:01.928
It wasn't your decision,

16:01.995 --> 16:03.796
was it?

16:03.863 --> 16:05.565
It was Polk.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.134
So arrogant.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.701
The world exists to serve him.

16:08.768 --> 16:11.804
There's a threat on his life,
and he makes it your problem.

16:11.871 --> 16:13.373
That's what they pay us for.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.811
You know,

16:18.878 --> 16:19.979
it could be anyone.

16:20.047 --> 16:21.914
Anyone could just walk up
and shoot him.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.617
Yeah. If they were
willing to die.

16:26.619 --> 16:30.123
Is that what you want
to discuss?

16:30.190 --> 16:32.825
The depth of my conviction?

16:32.892 --> 16:34.894
My willingness to die?

16:34.961 --> 16:36.396
You have something
you want to say,

16:36.463 --> 16:39.166
why don't you just tell me,
you know, what it is?

16:39.232 --> 16:40.500
I've shown you my hand

16:40.567 --> 16:41.701
twice now.

16:41.768 --> 16:43.703
The third time...

16:43.770 --> 16:45.572
it'll be for real.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.240
(distant siren wailing)

16:58.451 --> 16:59.719
CHARLIE:
John von Neumann once said

16:59.786 --> 17:01.688
that in mathematics
you don't understand things.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.256
You just get used to them.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.825
I wish I could have debated
that point with him,

17:05.892 --> 17:08.095
because it seems to me
that in mathematics,

17:08.161 --> 17:11.098
we find the power
to refuse fate.

17:11.164 --> 17:13.333
In understanding
the way things are,

17:13.400 --> 17:16.269
we give ourselves the means
to change them.

17:16.336 --> 17:19.206
Hey. So, the techs say
the firecrackers were rigged

17:19.272 --> 17:20.807
to a model rocket ignition set,

17:20.873 --> 17:22.975
set off by remote control.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.644
So he has technical expertise.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.446
Or a DSL connection.

17:26.513 --> 17:29.082
Took me three minutes to find
instructions on the Internet.

17:29.149 --> 17:30.517
Profile on the shooter?

17:30.583 --> 17:32.685
Male, Western European descent.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.687
Only, use of the term
African-American

17:34.754 --> 17:36.523
suggests he has
a college education.

17:36.589 --> 17:37.590
That's it?

17:37.657 --> 17:39.792
He knows not
to leave physical evidence.

17:39.859 --> 17:42.262
He also knows not to leave
much of a profile, I guess.

17:42.329 --> 17:44.397
You're sure this is your man?

17:44.464 --> 17:46.699
LIZ: He delivered six cartons
of napkins

17:46.766 --> 17:47.867
and paper cups.

17:47.934 --> 17:49.001
Chef said he didn't order it.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.170
Yeah, see where he unloaded?

17:50.237 --> 17:51.838
There, there and there.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.506
-The firecrackers were in
the box. -Oh, you're right.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.942
He did a pretty good job
of avoiding the cameras.

17:56.008 --> 17:58.511
-And?
-LARRY: And... consider

17:58.578 --> 18:01.381
a barbershop pole,
seen through a camera lens.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.383
If we see only a portion
of the pole,

18:03.450 --> 18:05.718
we infer movement up
and to the right.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.754
This is called
the aperture illusion.

18:07.820 --> 18:10.623
But remove the obstruction,
we see the end of the stripes,

18:10.690 --> 18:12.925
and then we're looking
at one side

18:12.992 --> 18:14.661
of one spinning pole.

18:14.727 --> 18:17.797
Unless the camera itself
is rotating.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.766
Now, kinematically,
there's no difference

18:19.832 --> 18:22.602
between a moving camera
on a still object,

18:22.669 --> 18:24.904
and a still camera
on a moving object.

18:24.971 --> 18:26.906
Or a series of still images,

18:26.973 --> 18:30.877
which we can use then to infer
a rounded image of your guy.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.445
And that would take...?

18:32.512 --> 18:34.347
Well, less time
with Amita's help.

18:34.414 --> 18:36.149
I'm sorry.
Something just occurred to me.

18:38.385 --> 18:40.220
Charlie's way
of changing the subject?

18:40.287 --> 18:41.988
You know, I think
there's something

18:42.054 --> 18:43.723
going on between
him and Amita.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.792
No. No, no, no, no. Out.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.093
Out! Out!

18:47.160 --> 18:48.695
Out. Out.

18:48.761 --> 18:51.030
Out, out, out.

18:51.097 --> 18:53.200
NIKKI: We're pulling
more assistance from LAPD,

18:53.266 --> 18:54.601
the marshals,
the sheriff's office,

18:54.667 --> 18:57.470
but we have got to seriously
consider a change of venue.

18:57.537 --> 18:59.839
Been through this already.
There's no time.

18:59.906 --> 19:02.175
DON: This reminds me of
this joke that my dad tells

19:02.242 --> 19:03.810
about a guy--
he's sitting on a roof

19:03.876 --> 19:04.977
in the middle of a flood,

19:05.044 --> 19:06.246
and a boat comes along,

19:06.313 --> 19:08.581
and he's, like, "No, thanks.
God's going to save me."

19:08.648 --> 19:10.250
Another one comes, same thing.

19:10.317 --> 19:12.084
Helicopter comes.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.887
"Pass. God's on his way."

19:14.954 --> 19:16.489
And of course, he drowns.

19:16.556 --> 19:19.859
And he says to God,
"Why'd you let me down?"

19:19.926 --> 19:22.195
And God says, "What the hell
do you want from me?

19:22.262 --> 19:23.830
I sent you two boats
and a helicopter."

19:23.896 --> 19:26.599
You're supposed to be God
in this story?

19:26.666 --> 19:29.602
I'm the guy in the boat,
wondering why you won't get on.

19:29.669 --> 19:33.773
Look, whoever this guy is,
whether he silences me

19:33.840 --> 19:39.111
with a bullet or with fear,
it amounts to the same thing.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.481
Think I got to stay on the roof.

19:43.650 --> 19:45.852
NIKKI:
Bodyguards.

19:45.918 --> 19:47.287
He's getting scared.

19:47.354 --> 19:50.089
Kind of stuff he talks about--

19:50.156 --> 19:52.492
volunteerism, compassion--

19:52.559 --> 19:54.961
that's not the kind of stuff
you shoot somebody over.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.597
Yeah, well,
someone disagrees with you.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.932
CHARLIE:
So, what occurred to me

19:59.999 --> 20:02.869
is that this assailant must have
clearly scouted this park prior

20:02.935 --> 20:03.870
to shooting at you.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.938
-Uh, us, actually.
-He was shooting at me?

20:06.005 --> 20:08.841
He was shooting at me.

20:08.908 --> 20:11.043
-So, what occurred to you?
-He must have identified

20:11.110 --> 20:13.880
a number of desirable locations
for firing on this band shell.

20:13.946 --> 20:15.982
And assuming that he plans
to make good on his threats...

20:16.048 --> 20:19.051
-He's not gonna give away
his favorite spot. -Yeah.

20:19.118 --> 20:22.054
I actually managed to get that
far without a single algorithm.

20:22.121 --> 20:24.757
-What do you bring to the party?
-Geomatic survey.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.859
Okay, we actually have
3-D maps of the whole area.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.861
Yeah, we have maps
of buildings and streets,

20:28.928 --> 20:30.997
but we're going
to build a thematic map

20:31.063 --> 20:34.467
with a bias for accessibility,
distance from the park...

20:34.534 --> 20:36.736
Target visibility,
practicality of the shot.

20:36.803 --> 20:39.272
Right.
What you bring to the party.

20:39.339 --> 20:41.040
-(trilling)
-Check this out.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.010
(trilling)

20:44.076 --> 20:46.012
CHARLIE:
Hey, man, you...

20:46.078 --> 20:47.880
you can you keep
a secret, right?

20:47.947 --> 20:51.183
I was a Chinese spy and a
double agent for two years.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.185
Managed to keep
that one under wraps.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.021
Well, uh, all right.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.989
I need some advice
about me and Amita.

20:57.056 --> 21:00.092
Well, it's about me and my dad
and Don and Amita.

21:00.159 --> 21:01.428
Um, I, uh...

21:01.494 --> 21:04.263
Yeah. Pass.

21:04.331 --> 21:05.898
Pass?

21:05.965 --> 21:07.900
Oh, yeah, pass.

21:12.038 --> 21:14.674
AMITA:
Can I ask you a question?

21:14.741 --> 21:16.242
LARRY: Does this touch upon
anything of a personal

21:16.309 --> 21:18.345
-and romantic nature?
-No.

21:18.411 --> 21:19.812
It's strictly case-related.

21:19.879 --> 21:21.348
Okay. Fire away.

21:21.414 --> 21:23.916
We have a man
who shoots at the FBI,

21:23.983 --> 21:26.519
shows them flaws
in their own security.

21:26.586 --> 21:28.054
Irrational actions, right?

21:28.120 --> 21:29.922
Yeah, ostensibly...

21:29.989 --> 21:31.524
Yet, he's intellectually
rigorous,

21:31.591 --> 21:34.060
even thorough
in evading identification.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.729
Now, maybe he's a
high-functioning psychopath.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.332
LARRY:
Or, when faced with an opponent

21:39.399 --> 21:41.701
of superior strength
and resources,

21:41.768 --> 21:44.871
he's opted to wage
unconventional warfare.

21:44.937 --> 21:47.173
AMITA: Like Douglas Lenat's
Eurisko program.

21:47.239 --> 21:49.809
You know, I should run
some simulations of my own.

21:49.876 --> 21:51.010
LARRY:
Applied game theory.

21:51.077 --> 21:53.713
You know who...

21:55.147 --> 21:56.816
Never mind.

21:58.117 --> 21:59.051
DAVID:
Shepard Crater.

21:59.118 --> 22:01.087
Teaches high school science
in Elko, Nevada.

22:01.153 --> 22:02.188
No arrests.

22:02.254 --> 22:04.023
But from 1978 to '81,

22:04.090 --> 22:06.125
the Intelligence Unit
had an interest in him.

22:06.192 --> 22:08.227
He ran with a group
called Resist First.

22:08.294 --> 22:09.396
The leaders were arrested

22:09.462 --> 22:10.930
for the bombing
of a construction site,

22:10.997 --> 22:12.565
though Crater
was never implicated.

22:12.632 --> 22:13.800
Well, any connections to Polk?

22:13.866 --> 22:16.603
No, and if you believe
the sheet,

22:16.669 --> 22:19.071
Crater got scared
somewhere between straight

22:19.138 --> 22:21.608
and amazingly dull
after his buddies got busted.

22:21.674 --> 22:24.644
He's been teaching longer than
Polk's been out of high school.

22:24.711 --> 22:26.713
Never been married,
no immediate family on record.

22:26.779 --> 22:27.947
DAVID:
Now, Crater hasn't shown up

22:28.014 --> 22:29.181
for work
for the last three weeks.

22:29.248 --> 22:31.250
The Las Vegas office
is knocking on doors.

22:31.317 --> 22:33.586
They're doing a deeper
background search.

22:33.653 --> 22:35.021
Show his picture to Polk?

22:35.087 --> 22:37.289
No, hold off. I want to see
what else we can hit him with.

22:37.356 --> 22:40.192
-Okay.
-CHARLIE: Colby and I did...

22:40.259 --> 22:42.662
well, we did an assassination
map of the rally area.

22:42.729 --> 22:46.399
It yielded seven
high-desirable sniper perches,

22:46.466 --> 22:49.869
another 12 with rough parity
to the location

22:49.936 --> 22:52.071
he shot at you...
or shot at us from.

22:52.138 --> 22:53.806
DAVID:
Colby's already working on this.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.207
He's, uh, doing
deployment adjustments,

22:55.274 --> 22:57.009
so, unless you need me here...?

22:57.076 --> 22:57.977
DON:
No. Go ahead.

22:58.044 --> 23:01.313
I keep thinking about this, uh,
hangman's thing...

23:01.380 --> 23:02.515
CHARLIE:
In retrospect,

23:02.582 --> 23:03.716
th-that seems like

23:03.783 --> 23:05.251
it might have been
an extemporaneous thought.

23:05.317 --> 23:09.188
DON: No. I think you're onto
something. I just...

23:09.255 --> 23:10.990
I don't know what yet, but...

23:15.628 --> 23:17.597
Anything you want to talk about?

23:17.664 --> 23:19.165
No, not really.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.333
Is there anything
you want to talk about?

23:21.400 --> 23:23.069
No.

23:23.135 --> 23:26.205
Okay. I'm glad
we cleared the air.

23:29.041 --> 23:30.610
(both laugh)

23:30.677 --> 23:32.845
No. You're okay, though, right?

23:32.912 --> 23:35.848
You're not dealing
with any residual pain, or...?

23:35.915 --> 23:38.485
You saw me hesitate in the park.

23:38.551 --> 23:43.189
Maybe you seemed to be moving
a little slower than usual.

23:43.255 --> 23:44.924
(sighs)

23:44.991 --> 23:46.158
You got stabbed.

23:46.225 --> 23:49.095
You... you almost died, so...

23:49.161 --> 23:50.429
(clears throat)

23:50.497 --> 23:52.499
You think, uh, it's possible

23:52.565 --> 23:55.134
that you pushed yourself
back to work too fast?

23:58.337 --> 23:59.872
I mean, it's just...

23:59.939 --> 24:03.042
how many things have we
seen done to the human body?

24:04.443 --> 24:08.247
Punctured, burned, broken.

24:08.314 --> 24:10.850
You know, we're just so
ridiculously fragile.

24:13.119 --> 24:14.954
(sighs)

24:15.021 --> 24:19.225
Somehow, you know, you don't
relate it to yourself, but...

24:19.291 --> 24:23.062
I'm just a bag of blood
and bones like everyone else.

24:24.363 --> 24:26.032
Boy, I'm not sure

24:26.098 --> 24:29.702
any of us would get out
of bed if we all felt that way.

24:29.769 --> 24:32.972
Yeah, well, I got to
get out of bed anyway.

24:35.675 --> 24:37.810
I can move fine, buddy.

24:37.877 --> 24:40.847
Maybe I'm just starting
to think before I do.

24:44.751 --> 24:47.419
COLBY: So, I know we agreed not
to talk politics...

24:47.486 --> 24:49.021
DAVID:
But?

24:49.088 --> 24:51.691
You got radicals
shooting other radicals

24:51.758 --> 24:53.526
for not being radical enough.

24:53.593 --> 24:56.295
There's got to be a moral
in there somewhere, right?

24:56.362 --> 24:58.631
Yeah, like, don't talk politics.

25:00.266 --> 25:03.369
Here we go--
number seven on Charlie's list.

25:03.435 --> 25:05.538
Fourth floor, south windows.

25:09.108 --> 25:11.243
I mean, let's just say
I ran for office.

25:11.310 --> 25:12.579
You'd vote for me, right?

25:12.645 --> 25:13.746
What are you running for?

25:13.813 --> 25:15.147
I mean, why does that matter?

25:15.214 --> 25:16.883
What, you wouldn't
vote for me?

25:16.949 --> 25:18.585
I've seen you balance
your checkbook

25:18.651 --> 25:20.086
with your fingers and your toes.

25:20.152 --> 25:22.655
(chuckles) Well, come to think
of it, you could be governor.

25:22.722 --> 25:26.192
All right, yeah,
we're not talking politics.

25:26.258 --> 25:29.061
Wait. What's wrong
with this staircase?

25:29.128 --> 25:31.030
COLBY:
It's the seventh one

25:31.097 --> 25:32.732
-I've walked today?
-No.

25:32.799 --> 25:35.034
The one leading up is
covered with crud, right?

25:35.101 --> 25:36.869
No one's been up that way
in a couple of weeks at least.

25:36.936 --> 25:38.537
Look at the one leading down
to the basement.

25:38.605 --> 25:39.706
COLBY:
Yeah, it's cleaner.

25:39.772 --> 25:40.873
Ten bucks says

25:40.940 --> 25:43.676
it's wet and dark down there.

25:46.613 --> 25:49.716
(electricity crackling)

26:19.912 --> 26:21.681
MAN:
Don't move!

26:24.083 --> 26:25.852
Please.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.486
I'm trying very hard

26:27.553 --> 26:29.656
not to kill you.

26:40.967 --> 26:44.070
MAN:
Agent Sinclair, right?

26:44.136 --> 26:46.005
Yeah.

26:46.072 --> 26:49.141
You're Shepard. Shepard Crater.

26:49.208 --> 26:52.378
CRATER: You know who I am, then
you know about Resist First,

26:52.444 --> 26:54.747
about my skill set.

26:54.814 --> 26:57.483
DAVID: I know that you walked
away from violence

26:57.549 --> 27:00.219
20 years ago.

27:00.286 --> 27:01.788
Why now?

27:01.854 --> 27:03.956
Why Polk?

27:06.058 --> 27:09.195
Because he doesn't deserve
the things that he says.

27:09.261 --> 27:11.197
Ask him about Portland.

27:11.263 --> 27:13.132
Ask him about people

27:13.199 --> 27:15.902
that did anything
he asked them to.

27:15.968 --> 27:18.705
People he sacrificed
like cannon fodder.

27:18.771 --> 27:20.773
DAVID:
Portland?

27:20.840 --> 27:22.709
The riots?

27:22.775 --> 27:25.177
Who got sacrificed?

27:27.947 --> 27:30.983
Shepard, who did he sacrifice?

27:33.185 --> 27:35.021
Come on!

27:35.087 --> 27:38.157
If Polk were standing there
right now,

27:38.224 --> 27:40.659
would you put yourself
between him and a bullet?

27:40.727 --> 27:43.362
DAVID:
Told you before.

27:43.429 --> 27:45.364
That's our job.

27:45.431 --> 27:47.266
Right, your job.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.535
Well, that means
that you're better men

27:49.601 --> 27:52.138
than him, which means your lives

27:52.204 --> 27:53.272
are more valuable, which means

27:53.339 --> 27:54.841
you shouldn't be standing
in front of that bullet.

27:54.907 --> 27:56.175
I've warned you.

27:56.242 --> 27:57.176
I've shown you.

27:57.243 --> 27:59.245
Anything that happens now
isn't my fault.

27:59.311 --> 28:00.346
DAVID:
Come on.

28:00.412 --> 28:04.717
We're trying to understand
what it is you want, okay?

28:04.784 --> 28:07.053
You got to help us out
a little bit here.

28:07.119 --> 28:10.156
Give us one good reason
why you're doing this.

28:10.222 --> 28:11.423
Okay?

28:11.490 --> 28:14.026
Give us two reasons.

28:15.661 --> 28:16.763
Three.

28:16.829 --> 28:21.233
(rapid gunfire)

28:48.194 --> 28:49.896
The bomb squad says
the detonators found

28:49.962 --> 28:51.497
in Crater's crash pad
were for something

28:51.563 --> 28:54.066
considerably bigger
than firecrackers.

28:54.133 --> 28:57.103
So, what have we got here,
a shooter or a bomber?

28:57.169 --> 28:58.637
Or both.

28:58.704 --> 28:59.906
From Nevada.

28:59.972 --> 29:02.174
Crater had a son
by a common-law wife--

29:02.241 --> 29:03.442
Richard Sloan.

29:03.509 --> 29:06.112
Now, in 2007,
Sloan's at a trade protest,

29:06.178 --> 29:07.880
and guess who's on the bullhorn.

29:07.947 --> 29:09.481
A young Mr. Polk.

29:09.548 --> 29:11.483
Yup. This is still Polk 1.0.

29:11.550 --> 29:12.819
The protest ended in tear gas,

29:12.885 --> 29:14.954
a whole lot of arrests
and six dead.

29:15.021 --> 29:16.222
-What? The kid?
-No.

29:16.288 --> 29:18.190
Richard Sloan got arrested,
and four days later,

29:18.257 --> 29:20.192
he was stabbed to death
in a jail fight.

29:20.259 --> 29:21.861
So Crater's putting it on Polk?

29:21.928 --> 29:23.963
There were rumors
Polk planned the violence.

29:24.030 --> 29:26.365
Okay, so the next day,
he has a press conference,

29:26.432 --> 29:28.500
denounces his own people
for getting out of hand,

29:28.567 --> 29:30.903
and then takes half
of the movement with him

29:30.970 --> 29:33.072
to a much more
media-friendly Polk 2.0.

29:33.139 --> 29:34.406
Okay. Now you hit him.

29:37.143 --> 29:39.745
All right, I-I guess
I've missed you guys again.

29:39.812 --> 29:41.080
Um,

29:41.147 --> 29:43.182
it's-it's no big deal,
but if you could please

29:43.249 --> 29:45.284
call me back,
that would be great.

29:45.351 --> 29:46.318
Thank you.

29:46.385 --> 29:47.753
(sighs)

29:47.820 --> 29:49.121
You on a new diet?

29:49.188 --> 29:50.756
New train of thought--

29:50.823 --> 29:52.558
the flavor of the cosmos.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.827
Ethyl formate.

29:54.894 --> 29:56.162
Where's that train taking you?

29:56.228 --> 29:57.663
You know, it's hard to say.

29:57.729 --> 29:58.965
Right now, I am suspended

29:59.031 --> 30:02.601
in this...
this maddening, thrilling

30:02.668 --> 30:04.971
moment just prior

30:05.037 --> 30:07.506
to the exhilaration
of epiphany.

30:07.573 --> 30:11.777
It's the intellectual itch
about to explode into a sneeze.

30:11.844 --> 30:13.279
How about you?

30:13.345 --> 30:16.815
Well, I already did my FBI deed
for the day, so, uh...

30:16.883 --> 30:18.150
Yeah, you know what?

30:18.217 --> 30:20.252
I'm gonna start banging
around on these boards.

30:20.319 --> 30:23.822
Oh, hey, that was good work
you did on the optic flow.

30:23.890 --> 30:25.424
Um, you and Amita.

30:25.491 --> 30:26.425
Raspberry seeds--

30:26.492 --> 30:28.127
they're arranged
in a Fibonacci sequence,

30:28.194 --> 30:30.162
-are they not?
-Yes, they are.

30:31.030 --> 30:33.132
Aren't you curious

30:33.199 --> 30:34.967
about what's-what's
going on with, uh...

30:35.034 --> 30:36.768
-with me and Amita?
-Well,

30:36.835 --> 30:38.837
given your historical trends,

30:38.905 --> 30:40.839
you factor in age,

30:40.907 --> 30:42.875
career dynamics,

30:42.942 --> 30:45.477
uh, concomitant
cultural pressures,

30:45.544 --> 30:47.013
it's fairly self-evident

30:47.079 --> 30:48.981
that one of you
has proposed marriage.

30:49.048 --> 30:51.517
And assuming that as my given,

30:51.583 --> 30:54.253
it's observable that neither
of you is as yet prepared

30:54.320 --> 30:57.289
to share the outcome
of said proposal,

30:57.356 --> 31:00.927
but it's a position
I intend to respect.

31:05.097 --> 31:07.033
LIZ:
Richard Sloan.

31:07.099 --> 31:09.535
He was killed in Portland, 2007.

31:09.601 --> 31:12.038
POLK:
Trade protest.

31:12.104 --> 31:15.341
I could feel myself spinning off
in the wrong direction.

31:15.407 --> 31:17.944
We were building
day-care centers,

31:18.010 --> 31:19.611
reaching out to the homeless.

31:19.678 --> 31:24.116
All anybody ever saw were
the overturned police cars.

31:24.183 --> 31:27.219
That day it...

31:27.286 --> 31:29.788
just got all out of control.

31:29.855 --> 31:32.358
Did it?

31:32.424 --> 31:34.526
You couldn't walk away
from The New Way,

31:34.593 --> 31:37.263
'cause everyone would know
you were that flaky rich boy

31:37.329 --> 31:40.066
you were trying so hard
to convince them you weren't.

31:40.132 --> 31:42.401
But a tragic riot, well--

31:42.468 --> 31:45.271
that gave you an excuse
and a new platform.

31:45.337 --> 31:48.007
A way to go respectable and keep
your street fighter cred.

31:48.074 --> 31:50.742
You've been reading the blogs.

31:50.809 --> 31:54.846
I've been watching the video.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.616
They can gas us,
they can club us.

31:57.683 --> 31:59.618
They cannot ignore us!

32:01.453 --> 32:04.256
Five seconds later,
first round of garbage cans

32:04.323 --> 32:06.192
go through a department store
window.

32:06.258 --> 32:07.259
Almost as if on cue.

32:07.326 --> 32:11.463
And that guy looks like
he's just given the cue.

32:11.530 --> 32:14.433
It's not exactly
the Zapruder film.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.202
Seven people died.

32:16.268 --> 32:18.337
It was a tragedy.

32:18.404 --> 32:21.173
A tragedy that led
to a lot of good

32:21.240 --> 32:23.042
and saved a lot more lives.

32:23.109 --> 32:25.377
We can shut you down,
revoke your permit.

32:25.444 --> 32:27.079
Eight hours
before the rally?

32:27.146 --> 32:28.447
A couple hundred cops try

32:28.514 --> 32:31.984
to kick 10,000 people
out of the park?

32:32.051 --> 32:34.720
That guy would eat it up.

32:34.786 --> 32:35.921
Play victim

32:35.988 --> 32:39.425
for the cameras and blame
all the violence on the FBI.

32:39.491 --> 32:43.095
Now, I don't see your boss

32:43.162 --> 32:45.097
or the governor

32:45.164 --> 32:47.566
or the mayor having
a big appetite

32:47.633 --> 32:50.002
for that kind of risk.

32:50.069 --> 32:52.471
All that crap you
said yesterday...

32:53.405 --> 32:55.841
you believe any of it?

32:55.907 --> 32:58.577
I believe all of it.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.420
-Next time you offer
to buy me lunch... -Yeah?

33:08.487 --> 33:09.655
...remind me to ask
for specifics.

33:09.721 --> 33:13.025
(chuckling): Well, I-I am
a retiree on a fixed income

33:13.092 --> 33:14.760
in these rather uncertain
economic times.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.728
(David chuckling)

33:16.795 --> 33:17.963
Mmm, hot dog is good.

33:18.030 --> 33:20.499
I'm gonna have to head back
in a few minutes. Okay?

33:20.566 --> 33:22.201
Oh, I know you're very busy.
I just,

33:22.268 --> 33:25.304
uh, I was just
checking in with you.

33:25.371 --> 33:26.938
-Don is doing fine.
-No, David,

33:27.005 --> 33:28.674
-I meant with you.
-Me?

33:28.740 --> 33:30.376
Well, since your promotion,

33:30.442 --> 33:32.378
you've been shouldering
more and more responsibility,

33:32.444 --> 33:33.479
but you never complain, David.

33:33.545 --> 33:37.483
Well, if you ever need
someone to complain to...

33:37.549 --> 33:40.886
-Thanks. I'll keep that
in mind, okay. - Okay.

33:40.952 --> 33:43.855
Actually, can I ask you
a question?

33:43.922 --> 33:45.191
-Some...
-Yeah.

33:45.257 --> 33:47.093
A... a father's point of view?

33:47.159 --> 33:48.894
Well, I do have that.

33:48.960 --> 33:50.229
Say that your son is killed,

33:50.296 --> 33:52.064
a-and you know
who's responsible--

33:52.131 --> 33:54.100
a-at least you think
you do, anyway--

33:54.166 --> 33:56.102
and he's not getting justice,

33:56.168 --> 33:57.603
so you decide to get it for him.

33:57.669 --> 34:00.206
What else am I going to do?
It's my son.

34:00.272 --> 34:02.441
See, my life stops
until he's spoken for.

34:02.508 --> 34:04.343
Okay, all right.

34:04.410 --> 34:06.645
You spend two years planning
to kill this guy, right,

34:06.712 --> 34:08.514
-and you're waiting for...
-Well, I'm afraid

34:08.580 --> 34:10.349
-I can't help you there, David.
-Why not?

34:10.416 --> 34:13.452
Well, because... (chuckles)
I-I'm not a killer.

34:13.519 --> 34:16.088
If I allow my rage
to change who I am,

34:16.155 --> 34:18.457
then this man has taken
two lives.

34:23.229 --> 34:25.297
(protesters shouting,
sirens wailing)

34:30.969 --> 34:33.038
SOG 4 is clear on Wilshire,

34:33.105 --> 34:35.141
heading into the Frozen Zone.

34:35.207 --> 34:37.042
(shouting continues)

34:37.109 --> 34:38.477
(siren whoops)

34:40.679 --> 34:42.047
(siren whooping)

34:42.114 --> 34:43.749
You kind of liked
the Kool-Aid, huh?

34:43.815 --> 34:44.916
NIKKI:
Turning your life around,

34:44.983 --> 34:48.120
using your own mistakes
to help other people.

34:48.187 --> 34:49.988
Guess I'm a sucker
for that story.

34:50.055 --> 34:52.124
(shouting continues)

34:53.925 --> 34:55.761
-(thumping)
-Your fans.

34:55.827 --> 34:59.765
When you lead,
you have to sacrifice your soul.

34:59.831 --> 35:02.768
You make decisions
you know will haunt you,

35:02.834 --> 35:06.272
sacrifice the few
to benefit the most.

35:06.338 --> 35:07.506
Anyone who tells you
any different

35:07.573 --> 35:08.740
hasn't studied history.

35:08.807 --> 35:11.177
You know, I've studied
a little bit of history,

35:11.243 --> 35:12.711
and I've led.

35:12.778 --> 35:15.247
Think I'll try to hang on
to my soul, though.

35:15.314 --> 35:18.184
(shouting continues)

35:18.250 --> 35:19.618
(siren whooping)

35:19.685 --> 35:22.521
I thought they were pulling out
all the garbage cans.

35:22.588 --> 35:24.290
Garbage cans and mailboxes.

35:24.356 --> 35:27.259
Yeah, we've got possible
explosives on Wilshire.

35:27.326 --> 35:29.428
-LIZ: Pull off.
-(explosion)

35:29.495 --> 35:31.163
-Get down!
-(people screaming)

35:31.230 --> 35:33.232
(explosions)

35:33.299 --> 35:34.900
(glass shattering)

35:41.940 --> 35:43.942
(sirens wailing,
tires squealing)

35:44.009 --> 35:45.277
(explosions)

35:50.982 --> 35:51.950
(clamoring)

35:52.017 --> 35:53.385
Liz, talk to me.

35:53.452 --> 35:55.153
There's a lot
of smoke and flame,

35:55.221 --> 35:56.822
but almost no concussion.

35:56.888 --> 35:58.424
It was more like pyro
than serious explosives.

35:58.490 --> 36:00.426
DON: Let's get the bomb squad
here anyway,

36:00.492 --> 36:01.993
and let's start shutting down
that rally.

36:02.060 --> 36:03.895
-We're going back to the hotel.
-You can't shut us down.

36:03.962 --> 36:06.298
-That's what Crater wants.
-Yeah, well, then he won.

36:06.365 --> 36:09.501
(tires screeching)

36:12.871 --> 36:15.307
CHARLIE: You heard what happened
at the rally, right?

36:15.374 --> 36:17.142
AMITA: Yeah, I was just
applying the attacks

36:17.209 --> 36:20.279
-to some war game scenarios
I've been running. -And?

36:20.346 --> 36:21.813
Well, it makes perfect sense

36:21.880 --> 36:23.349
with Crater's strategy,

36:23.415 --> 36:25.451
which has been making no sense.

36:25.517 --> 36:26.452
How so?

36:26.518 --> 36:28.287
Crater and the FBI are playing

36:28.354 --> 36:29.921
an imperfect information game

36:29.988 --> 36:31.590
like dominoes.

36:31.657 --> 36:33.259
Right, where they only
see their own tiles,

36:33.325 --> 36:34.360
not their opponents'.

36:34.426 --> 36:36.262
But Crater is playing checkers,

36:36.328 --> 36:38.230
exposing not only
his own strategy

36:38.297 --> 36:39.598
but the weaknesses in ours.

36:39.665 --> 36:42.301
In the hangman's paradox,
there's one school of thought

36:42.368 --> 36:45.237
that argues that
the problem itself is flawed.

36:45.304 --> 36:48.574
Right, just because the judge
sets a rule doesn't mean

36:48.640 --> 36:51.743
the prisoner should assume
he's going to follow that rule.

36:51.810 --> 36:56.315
Every time Crater exposes
a flaw in our strategy,

36:56.382 --> 36:58.784
he forces us
to behave reactively.

36:58.850 --> 37:00.586
Closing the holes
by moving the resources

37:00.652 --> 37:02.254
on the terms that he set.

37:02.321 --> 37:05.957
Moving Polk toward
Crater's terrain.

37:06.024 --> 37:10.496
He never intended to kill him
at that rally.

37:11.397 --> 37:13.499
(distant siren wailing)

37:29.180 --> 37:32.017
COLBY:
Put the gun down, Shepard.

37:41.527 --> 37:44.162
CRATER: Does he know
you used him as a decoy?

37:44.229 --> 37:47.533
DAVID:
No.

37:47.599 --> 37:50.502
Maybe you're not
that good a man.

37:50.569 --> 37:52.103
DAVID:
I could tell you how all this

37:52.170 --> 37:53.505
wouldn't bring your son back

37:53.572 --> 37:56.207
and how you would have made
a hero out of him.

37:56.274 --> 37:57.576
It just comes down to the fact

37:57.643 --> 38:01.847
that we can't let you
pull that trigger.

38:14.460 --> 38:16.462
I visited Richie in jail

38:16.528 --> 38:19.831
two days be...

38:19.898 --> 38:21.833
befo...

38:22.934 --> 38:26.004
...befo...

38:26.071 --> 38:28.006
before...

38:29.875 --> 38:32.143
I tried to bail him out, but,

38:32.210 --> 38:33.479
uh, there were so many arrests

38:33.545 --> 38:35.347
that it took them a week
to arraign everyone.

38:35.414 --> 38:38.484
By then...

38:38.550 --> 38:41.152
(inhales deeply)

38:41.219 --> 38:43.088
Richie told me
Polk planned the whole thing,

38:43.154 --> 38:45.357
used them.

38:45.424 --> 38:48.694
I've been carrying his story
around for two years.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.862
So put down the gun and tell it.

38:50.929 --> 38:52.097
(Crater scoffs)

38:52.163 --> 38:55.601
Sure... sure.

38:55.667 --> 38:56.902
(scoffs)

38:56.968 --> 39:00.372
The words of a ghost
through the voice of a...

39:00.439 --> 39:02.240
of a what?

39:02.307 --> 39:05.310
What?

39:05.377 --> 39:06.378
What am I?

39:06.445 --> 39:08.747
What?

39:08.814 --> 39:12.818
DAVID: You're a father
that lost his son, right,

39:12.884 --> 39:16.021
that does not want
to lose himself.

39:16.087 --> 39:18.424
(sighs)

39:18.490 --> 39:19.958
I told Richie all those stories

39:20.025 --> 39:23.462
about, uh, who I'd been,
what I'd done.

39:23.529 --> 39:27.232
I told him...

39:27.298 --> 39:31.603
I told him that a man was the
things that he believes in.

39:31.670 --> 39:35.741
I did everything
but drive him to that rally.

39:35.807 --> 39:38.410
Shepard, when everyone else
was arrested in 1978,

39:38.477 --> 39:40.879
there's a reason
that you were not.

39:40.946 --> 39:44.416
Okay, I don't think you could
have taken it that far.

39:45.350 --> 39:47.619
Listen... you...

39:47.686 --> 39:50.456
are not a killer.

39:55.360 --> 39:57.463
I killed my son!

40:03.034 --> 40:05.771
Polk was just...

40:05.837 --> 40:10.041
He was just the thing
I didn't protect him from.

40:13.512 --> 40:15.447
But it doesn't matter.

40:15.514 --> 40:16.715
No, it doesn't matter.

40:16.782 --> 40:17.716
Doesn't matter at all.

40:17.783 --> 40:19.317
Doesn't matter to anyone but me.

40:19.384 --> 40:21.487
(breathes deeply)

40:24.456 --> 40:26.725
It matters to us, Shepard.

40:26.792 --> 40:28.460
Come on.

40:28.527 --> 40:32.397
Listen, just put the gun down.

40:32.464 --> 40:34.466
Come back.

40:34.533 --> 40:36.134
Please.

40:36.201 --> 40:37.368
Ple...

40:37.435 --> 40:39.104
(three gunshots)

40:39.170 --> 40:40.138
(body thuds to floor)

40:41.272 --> 40:43.341
(gasps)

40:43.408 --> 40:45.877
Control, we need a medic.

40:45.944 --> 40:47.245
(groans)

40:47.312 --> 40:49.247
DAVID:
Ambulance is on the way.

40:49.314 --> 40:50.415
(Crater sighs)

40:50.482 --> 40:52.250
Nah.

40:52.317 --> 40:54.620
My son's story
belongs to you now.

40:54.686 --> 40:57.455
(Crater sighs)

40:57.523 --> 40:59.257
(coughs)

41:11.169 --> 41:13.705
CHARLIE (over recorder):
Hightower, Knox,

41:13.772 --> 41:16.942
Newberry, Beiderman.

41:17.008 --> 41:20.512
Each of their signatures
is a self-swallowing set,

41:20.579 --> 41:24.049
a name that shorthands
a body of thought,

41:24.115 --> 41:27.352
a life's work.

41:27.418 --> 41:30.656
The question isn't who you are.

41:30.722 --> 41:35.594
The question is:
Who did I turn out to be?

41:35.661 --> 41:37.128
-CHARLIE: Okay, you ready?
-AMITA: Yeah.

41:37.195 --> 41:37.963
-Hey.
-Hey.

41:38.029 --> 41:39.264
-ALAN: Hi.
-DON: What's up?

41:39.330 --> 41:41.567
CHARLIE: We, uh, we have
something to tell you.

41:41.633 --> 41:42.634
-We're getting married.
-(Charlie chuckles)

41:42.701 --> 41:44.302
We're getting married.

41:44.369 --> 41:46.171
-Oh. -CHARLIE: You guys
are the first to know.

41:46.237 --> 41:48.339
After my parents, which is
my fault, because I wanted

41:48.406 --> 41:49.507
Charlie to ask their permission.

41:49.575 --> 41:51.543
It's just a formality,
but it's a family tradition.

41:51.610 --> 41:53.178
Yeah, it's a formality
that required

41:53.244 --> 41:55.246
a four-day game of
transatlantic phone tag,

41:55.313 --> 41:57.583
which is why I've been
a little, you know, evasive.

41:57.649 --> 41:59.585
-Oh, I see.
-But it feels

41:59.651 --> 42:00.819
really good to get it out.

42:00.886 --> 42:01.820
Uh, I actually...

42:01.887 --> 42:03.388
I kind of almost
spilled the beans

42:03.454 --> 42:04.522
more than a few
times, but, uh...

42:04.590 --> 42:06.424
It's hard keeping a secret,
but it's kind of fun...

42:06.491 --> 42:07.425
-It was fun.
-...keeping a secret.

42:07.492 --> 42:08.459
I think we did good.

42:08.526 --> 42:10.295
Congratulations.

42:10.361 --> 42:11.863
DON: What do you say?
I think we get the,

42:11.930 --> 42:13.298
-the good stuff out, huh?
-ALAN: Yeah.

42:14.399 --> 42:16.367
What, you-you already knew?

42:16.434 --> 42:19.738
-How did you already know?
-Your parents told me.

42:19.805 --> 42:22.340
Come on,
it's what I do for a living.

42:22.407 --> 42:24.676
-So I told him. -All right, he
might have mentioned it, but...

42:24.743 --> 42:26.044
DON (laughs):
Come here, sister-in-law.

42:26.111 --> 42:26.878
Congratulations.

42:26.945 --> 42:28.747
ALAN:
Big secret, huh?

42:28.814 --> 42:30.949
CHARLIE:
Who am I to you?

42:31.016 --> 42:33.919
Are faded chalk marks
and scratches on the floor

42:33.985 --> 42:37.155
the only evidence
that I was here,

42:37.222 --> 42:41.192
or did some scribbled note,
some fragment of a proof

42:41.259 --> 42:44.129
invert your perception
of the world...

42:44.195 --> 42:46.131
* And then you cut

42:46.197 --> 42:47.966
...even confirm it,

42:48.033 --> 42:51.637
cementing what you knew
in your heart to be true,

42:51.703 --> 42:55.641
with the balance
of left column to right?

42:57.909 --> 42:59.177
* And everything

42:59.244 --> 43:02.513
What footprints have I
left behind?

43:02.580 --> 43:04.415
Do they endure,

43:04.482 --> 43:08.553
or has the ocean of discovery
washed them away already?

43:08.620 --> 43:10.656
* Goes back to the beginning

43:10.722 --> 43:12.658
* Silence seizes
a cluttered room *

43:12.724 --> 43:15.894
How many lives have I touched?

43:17.796 --> 43:20.531
* Light is shed
not a breath too soon *

43:20.598 --> 43:22.768
Have I touched yours?

43:24.169 --> 43:30.575
* Never said it was good,
never said it was new *

43:30.642 --> 43:34.680
* Muted whisper
of the things you feel. *

44:01.707 --> 44:03.041
(gunshot)
