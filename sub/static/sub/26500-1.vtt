As the first rays

drizzle the ocean deep,

01:08.850 --> 01:12.187
another fun day begins in
Fishtale Reef.

01:13.106 --> 01:14.774
So our story begins.

01:16.442 --> 01:20.777
Fifi and Fin live with their
parents, Mama and Papa Fish,

01:20.779 --> 01:22.946
in a colorful coral house

01:22.948 --> 01:25.907
surrounded by green,
squishy seaweed

01:25.909 --> 01:29.413
in the fabulous, fun-filled
Fishtale Reef.

01:30.999 --> 01:33.124
It's the first day of school

01:33.126 --> 01:36.044
and Fifi and Finn
are very excited.

01:37.296 --> 01:42.383
Fifi, an adorable pink-colored
fish with long eyelashes,

01:42.385 --> 01:45.970
wears a shiny pink bow
on her head.

01:45.972 --> 01:48.431
How do I look, Fin?

01:48.433 --> 01:52.309
Her brother Fin,
a handsome blue-colored fish,

01:52.311 --> 01:56.187
wears oversized eyeglasses
and a baseball hat

01:56.189 --> 01:59.149
he found lying on
the ocean floor.

01:59.151 --> 02:01.068
Swishy, cute, and big.

02:01.070 --> 02:02.485
How about me?

02:02.487 --> 02:04.990
Ooh, fish-boppin' fantastic!

02:06.826 --> 02:08.324
I like your hat.

02:08.327 --> 02:09.533
Thanks, sis.

02:09.536 --> 02:11.871
Gotta look cool on the
first day of school.

02:11.873 --> 02:14.540
I'm a little nervous.

02:14.542 --> 02:15.665
About what?

02:15.667 --> 02:18.753
Well, about seeing
all my friends,

02:18.755 --> 02:21.757
about who my teacher
is going to be.

02:24.928 --> 02:27.510
Happy day, my little fishies,

02:27.512 --> 02:29.014
Happy day, Mama.

02:33.852 --> 02:35.685
Ready for the
first day of school?

02:35.687 --> 02:38.855
I'm ready,
but Fifi is nervous.

02:38.857 --> 02:41.399
Why are you nervous, Fifi?

02:41.401 --> 02:43.694
I haven't seen my
friends all summer.

02:43.696 --> 02:45.195
Will they remember me?

02:45.197 --> 02:47.323
Who will my teacher be?

02:47.325 --> 02:48.950
It's okay to feel nervous

02:48.952 --> 02:51.535
on your first day of school,
Fifi.

02:51.537 --> 02:53.371
Everyone does.

02:53.373 --> 02:55.873
Soon you'll be
having so much fun,

02:55.875 --> 02:58.542
all those nervous
feelings will wash away.

02:58.544 --> 02:59.919
How are you feeling, Fin?

02:59.921 --> 03:01.212
I'm excited.

03:01.214 --> 03:04.339
I'm gonna see my best
friend Sammie Swordfish,

03:04.341 --> 03:06.926
the coolest fish in the sea.

03:08.054 --> 03:10.887
I thought I was the
coolest fish in the sea.

03:10.889 --> 03:13.724
I'm so proud of you two.

03:13.726 --> 03:15.100
Ready to go?

03:15.102 --> 03:16.226
Yes!

03:18.356 --> 03:21.064
Every year on
the first day of school,

03:21.066 --> 03:25.820
Mama and Papa Fish swim Fifi
and Fin to the edge of the reef

03:25.822 --> 03:30.741
where ocean rock coves become
fish-filled classrooms.

03:30.743 --> 03:32.242
Lily!

03:32.244 --> 03:34.579
Look, it's my best friend Lily.

03:34.581 --> 03:37.333
Thanks for swimming
me to school.

03:38.917 --> 03:40.542
Sammie!

03:40.544 --> 03:42.587
See you later, alligators.

03:42.589 --> 03:44.921
Have a fun morning at school.

03:44.923 --> 03:48.510
We'll be here to swim
you home for lunch.

03:49.345 --> 03:52.597
Lily, it's so good to see you.

03:52.599 --> 03:54.265
How was your summer?

03:54.267 --> 03:56.850
My grandparents were awesome.

03:56.852 --> 04:00.313
We ate delicious
food all the time.

04:00.315 --> 04:01.772
How was your summer?

04:02.733 --> 04:03.734
Super fun.

04:04.776 --> 04:07.738
We played lots of
games in the reef.

04:08.739 --> 04:10.657
Oh look, there's Pedal!

04:11.784 --> 04:13.870
Pedal, how was your trip?

04:14.828 --> 04:16.245
It was amazing.

04:17.789 --> 04:20.123
Did you get to walk on land?

04:20.125 --> 04:22.000
What was it like?

04:22.002 --> 04:24.462
I did walk on land.

04:24.464 --> 04:26.507
It was a very sandy beach

04:27.425 --> 04:30.178
and the sand
tickled my flippers.

04:32.262 --> 04:34.638
This is so much fun.

04:34.640 --> 04:36.391
I love being friends.

04:37.560 --> 04:40.977
Fifi has forgotten
all about being nervous.

04:40.979 --> 04:43.940
She is too busy having fun.

04:48.488 --> 04:50.820
It's Principal
Bellowing Whale.

04:50.822 --> 04:53.073
School's about to begin.

04:53.075 --> 04:55.618
Who do you think we'll
get for our teacher?

04:55.620 --> 04:57.953
I hope it's Professor Shark.

04:57.955 --> 04:59.330
Me too!

04:59.332 --> 05:03.875
My dad says he's the
smartest shark in the sea.

05:03.877 --> 05:05.335
As little
fish laugh

05:05.337 --> 05:07.046
and play in the school park,

05:07.048 --> 05:11.302
they all hope their new
teacher is Professor Shark.

05:12.844 --> 05:16.681
As the early morning sunshine
beats down in the sea,

05:16.683 --> 05:21.644
the young fish wait to hear
who their teacher will be.

05:23.000 --> 05:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:32.281 --> 05:37.286
The next 10 fish
will report to the classroom.

05:39.497 --> 05:40.331
Lily.

05:41.248 --> 05:42.748
That's me!

05:42.750 --> 05:44.207
Fifi.

05:44.209 --> 05:46.460
We're together!

05:46.462 --> 05:48.044
Pedal.

05:48.046 --> 05:48.839
Trigger.

05:49.841 --> 05:51.423
Kiki.

05:51.425 --> 05:52.799
Sammie.

05:52.801 --> 05:53.635
Tang.

05:54.553 --> 05:59.517
And lastly, Diesel, Chopper,
and Fin.

06:00.142 --> 06:00.976
Oh no.

06:02.019 --> 06:04.187
My brother is in my class.

06:05.397 --> 06:10.109
All 10 of you
report to the classroom.

06:10.111 --> 06:12.277
Your teacher will be...

06:17.452 --> 06:19.120
Oh, Professor Shark.

06:23.332 --> 06:25.582
The 10
classmates gather around

06:25.584 --> 06:29.378
Professor Shark, a kind
and thoughtful teacher

06:29.380 --> 06:32.380
and the smartest
shark in the sea.

06:32.382 --> 06:35.967
Five fish bob on one
side of Professor Shark,

06:35.969 --> 06:38.346
five fish on the other,

06:38.348 --> 06:41.765
all of them thrilled
to be in his class.

06:41.767 --> 06:42.601
Welcome!

06:43.894 --> 06:47.979
I'm so happy to have
all of you in my class.

06:47.981 --> 06:49.899
Since it's the first
day of school,

06:49.901 --> 06:52.400
I'd like each of you to
tell us your name

06:52.402 --> 06:55.613
and something
special about yourself.

06:55.615 --> 06:56.950
I will go first.

06:58.116 --> 07:00.116
I am Professor Shark.

07:00.118 --> 07:03.537
I have thousands of
sharp teeth in my mouth,

07:03.539 --> 07:05.415
but I am very friendly.

07:06.793 --> 07:11.753
I have been teaching for many
years and I love what I do.

07:11.755 --> 07:14.800
I am very excited to
meet all of you.

07:15.885 --> 07:18.426
My name if Fifi.

07:18.428 --> 07:21.933
I am a pastel fish with big
goldfish eyes.

07:23.017 --> 07:24.808
Is that special?

07:24.810 --> 07:26.726
Yes, it is.

07:26.728 --> 07:28.604
What is your favorite color?

07:28.606 --> 07:30.106
Pink.

07:30.108 --> 07:32.442
As you can see, I love pink.

07:36.363 --> 07:39.698
I'm Fifi's brother and
I'm a blue pastel fish

07:39.700 --> 07:41.618
with big goldfish eyes.

07:42.495 --> 07:43.995
Yes, you are.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.621
What do you want to be
when you grow up, Fin?

07:46.623 --> 07:48.082
A scientist.

07:48.084 --> 07:50.209
I like learning about the sea.

07:50.211 --> 07:51.835
That's wonderful.

07:51.837 --> 07:56.173
The ocean is filled with so
many amazing things to discover.

07:56.175 --> 07:58.551
That makes you very special,
Fin.

07:58.553 --> 07:59.510
I'm Lily.

07:59.512 --> 08:00.971
I am a blue whale.

08:01.889 --> 08:03.638
Whales are not fish.

08:03.640 --> 08:04.890
We are mammals.

08:04.892 --> 08:06.393
I can breathe air.

08:07.896 --> 08:12.731
I love to eat and I'm going
to be very big when I grow up.

08:12.733 --> 08:15.234
And Lily is my best friend.

08:15.236 --> 08:17.861
Oh and Fifi's my best friend.

08:17.863 --> 08:19.697
Nice to meet you, Lily.

08:19.699 --> 08:22.952
Whales are very
special marine mammals.

08:23.911 --> 08:26.203
My name is Pedal.

08:26.205 --> 08:27.581
I'm a sea turtle.

08:28.541 --> 08:30.668
Sea turtles are reptiles.

08:32.044 --> 08:34.587
I can breathe underwater.

08:34.589 --> 08:37.380
I can also crawl onto land

08:37.381 --> 08:41.885
and let my hard turtle
shell soak up some sun.

08:41.886 --> 08:45.224
I want to be a detective when I
grow up.

08:46.059 --> 08:49.769
Being a detective is a very
special job.

08:49.771 --> 08:52.938
I bet you are one smart turtle.

08:52.940 --> 08:57.235
I'm Sammie Swordfish, the
coolest fish in the sea.

08:57.237 --> 09:01.572
Chop, chop, I have a really
cool sword as a nose.

09:01.574 --> 09:05.492
I can swim really fast
and I like to tell jokes.

09:08.790 --> 09:11.874
Telling jokes is a very
special talent.

09:11.876 --> 09:15.377
I look forward to hearing
some of your jokes, Sammie.

09:15.379 --> 09:18.255
I'm Kiki, a pufferfish.

09:18.257 --> 09:21.886
I can blow my body up
into a big round ball.

09:22.804 --> 09:26.429
I have a lot of sharp spikes on
my body.

09:26.431 --> 09:29.433
I love to play ocean soccer.

09:29.435 --> 09:31.851
I like to play soccer too.

09:31.853 --> 09:35.356
Playing sports is a
very special skill.

09:35.358 --> 09:36.399
I'm Diesel.

09:36.401 --> 09:37.732
I'm a Manta ray.

09:37.734 --> 09:42.779
I have a really flat body,
so I can swim super fast.

09:42.781 --> 09:45.283
I want to be a singer.

09:48.246 --> 09:50.037
♪ Yeah ♪

09:50.039 --> 09:52.125
What a beautiful voice.

09:53.459 --> 09:56.751
Singing is a very
special talent.

09:56.753 --> 09:58.169
I'm Chopper.

09:58.171 --> 10:00.757
I have really big, sharp teeth.

10:01.593 --> 10:05.760
But like Professor
Shark, I'm friendly too.

10:05.762 --> 10:10.435
I want to be a deep sea diver
and find buried treasures.

10:13.438 --> 10:15.103
Wow!

10:15.105 --> 10:16.731
Buried treasure?

10:16.733 --> 10:18.151
That sounds cool.

10:19.735 --> 10:21.069
Hi, I'm Trigger.

10:21.988 --> 10:24.322
I'm a very special fish.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.741
I have a head
shaped like a horse

10:26.743 --> 10:31.662
and a really cool tail that
I can wrap around seaweed.

10:31.664 --> 10:33.872
I want to be a teacher when I
grow up.

10:34.709 --> 10:37.250
An adventurer and a teacher!

10:37.252 --> 10:39.544
Very special careers.

10:39.546 --> 10:40.795
I'm Tang.

10:40.797 --> 10:42.716
I'm a yellow tang fish.

10:44.009 --> 10:48.596
I have a really cool
head-fin feathery crest.

10:48.598 --> 10:51.348
I want to be a fish groomer.

10:51.350 --> 10:52.515
Thank you, Tang.

10:52.517 --> 10:55.561
Grooming other fish is
a special talent too.

10:55.563 --> 10:58.396
What an interesting
group of fish.

11:00.526 --> 11:02.901
Ah, that's the lunch bell, kids.

11:02.903 --> 11:04.861
Well, I'm really looking forward

11:04.863 --> 11:06.905
to teaching you all this year.

11:09.160 --> 11:13.246
As the new sun
casts shadows on Fishtale Reef,

11:13.248 --> 11:16.166
the fish swim home
to talk and eat.

11:22.674 --> 11:25.216
As Principal Whale's
voice bellow

11:25.218 --> 11:27.175
an underwater punch,

11:27.177 --> 11:31.056
everyone in Fishtale Reef
swims home for lunch.

11:35.936 --> 11:37.812
You must be hungry.

11:37.814 --> 11:39.396
Let's have some lunch.

11:39.398 --> 11:42.732
Then I want to hear
all about school.

11:42.734 --> 11:44.360
Yes, let's hurry home.

11:44.362 --> 11:46.361
There's a fish football
match on TV.

11:46.363 --> 11:48.365
I don't want to miss it.

11:54.247 --> 11:58.415
Now that we've all eaten,
tell us all about your morning.

11:59.252 --> 12:02.252
Fin and I are
in the same class.

12:02.254 --> 12:04.212
Did you hear that, Papa?

12:04.214 --> 12:07.592
Fin and Fifi are
in the same class.

12:07.594 --> 12:09.427
Papa is
so busy watching

12:09.429 --> 12:11.261
the fish football match,

12:11.263 --> 12:14.807
he does not hear what
Fifi or Mama Fish said,

12:14.809 --> 12:17.351
but he pretends he does.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.147
Yes, yes.

12:20.064 --> 12:22.773
And our teacher is
Professor Shark.

12:22.775 --> 12:24.608
Professor Shark?

12:24.610 --> 12:27.944
He's the best teacher in
Fishtale Reef.

12:27.946 --> 12:29.947
Did you hear that, Papa?

12:29.949 --> 12:33.617
Papa Fish is
watching the fish football game.

12:33.619 --> 12:36.703
Again, he pretends
to be listening.

12:36.705 --> 12:39.289
Oh, yes, yes, very good.

12:39.291 --> 12:42.000
I like to watch
football on TV too,

12:42.002 --> 12:45.837
but today is Fifi and
Fin's first day of school.

12:45.839 --> 12:49.467
Yes, Papa, please
turn off the TV.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.135
Please, Papa.

12:51.137 --> 12:52.220
Papa.

12:52.222 --> 12:55.139
Papa Fish
hears his name being called.

12:55.141 --> 12:58.726
He looks up and sees his
family staring at him.

12:58.728 --> 13:00.396
He turns off the TV.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.355
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:02.357 --> 13:04.774
You've been talking and
I've been watching TV.

13:04.776 --> 13:05.982
I know it's your first
day of school

13:05.984 --> 13:08.318
and you must have
a lot to tell me.

13:08.320 --> 13:09.319
We do.

13:09.321 --> 13:12.323
Fifi and I are
in the same class.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.033
Well, that's amazing.

13:14.035 --> 13:16.952
Our teacher is
Professor Shark.

13:16.954 --> 13:18.663
Professor Shark!

13:18.665 --> 13:21.164
He's the best teacher in
Fishtale Reef.

13:21.166 --> 13:23.458
That is very exciting news.

13:23.460 --> 13:25.669
What did you
learn this morning?

13:25.671 --> 13:28.965
We learned that each
of us is special.

13:28.967 --> 13:31.342
Professor Shark
said I was special

13:31.344 --> 13:33.928
because I like learning
about the sea.

13:33.930 --> 13:36.972
He thought it was cool that
I want to be a scientist

13:36.974 --> 13:38.473
when I grow up.

13:38.475 --> 13:41.686
Papa and I think
you're special too, Fin.

13:41.688 --> 13:43.980
What about you, Fifi,
what did you learn?

13:43.982 --> 13:48.024
Professor Shark said that
I am really special too.

13:48.026 --> 13:50.528
He asked what my
favorite color was

13:50.530 --> 13:53.197
and laughed when
I said it was pink.

13:54.450 --> 13:55.533
You're a pink fish

13:55.535 --> 13:57.952
that loves to wear pink
ribbons in your hair

13:57.954 --> 13:59.787
and your favorite color is pink.

14:02.249 --> 14:04.125
That is funny.

14:04.127 --> 14:06.877
Is your best friend Lily in
your class?

14:06.879 --> 14:08.004
Oh, yes.

14:08.006 --> 14:11.381
I'm so excited that
she is in my class.

14:11.383 --> 14:14.385
Is your best friend
Sammie in your class, Fin?

14:14.387 --> 14:15.343
He is.

14:15.345 --> 14:16.971
He likes to tell jokes.

14:16.973 --> 14:21.016
Professor Shark said that
is a very special talent.

14:21.018 --> 14:21.893
It is.

14:21.895 --> 14:23.895
I love hearing jokes.

14:23.897 --> 14:26.188
Who else is in your class?

14:26.190 --> 14:28.691
Um, Pedal the sea turtle.

14:28.693 --> 14:30.775
He wants to be a detective.

14:30.777 --> 14:32.986
And Trigger, the seahorse.

14:32.988 --> 14:35.157
She wants to be a teacher.

14:37.118 --> 14:39.076
How many is that, Fin?

14:39.078 --> 14:41.164
Hm, there's you and me.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.081
That is two.

14:44.083 --> 14:45.917
Lily is three.

14:45.919 --> 14:47.500
Sammie is four.

14:47.502 --> 14:49.419
Pedal is five.

14:49.421 --> 14:51.380
Trigger is six.

14:51.382 --> 14:53.256
Chopper is seven.

14:53.258 --> 14:55.927
How many students
are in your class?

14:55.929 --> 14:57.220
10!

14:57.222 --> 14:58.596
Who are the other three?

14:58.598 --> 14:59.431
Hm.

15:00.432 --> 15:02.766
Oh yes, Yellow Tang.

15:02.768 --> 15:05.352
He has a feathery head fin.

15:05.354 --> 15:08.105
He wants to be a fish groomer.

15:08.107 --> 15:09.606
Tang makes eight.

15:09.608 --> 15:11.943
That leaves two other fish.

15:11.945 --> 15:12.776
Diesel.

15:12.778 --> 15:14.236
He's a Manta ray.

15:14.238 --> 15:15.989
He swims really fast.

15:17.075 --> 15:20.742
And he has a really
beautiful voice.

15:20.744 --> 15:24.329
Professor Shark said
singing is a special talent.

15:24.331 --> 15:27.668
Oh my, what a wonderful
group of fish.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.877
They're not all fish, Mama.

15:30.879 --> 15:33.338
Some of them are marine mammals.

15:33.340 --> 15:34.966
Like Lily the whale.

15:34.968 --> 15:36.424
She's a mammal.

15:36.426 --> 15:37.968
That's right!

15:37.970 --> 15:40.096
You've learned so much already.

15:40.098 --> 15:41.097
Oh.

15:41.099 --> 15:42.430
We have.

15:42.432 --> 15:45.518
And the 10th fish
in our class is Kiki.

15:45.520 --> 15:47.436
She's a pufferfish.

15:47.438 --> 15:50.313
She loves football like you,
Papa.

15:50.315 --> 15:51.856
That's right, Papa.

15:51.858 --> 15:53.985
She loves football like you.

15:55.195 --> 15:59.490
Speaking of football,
why don't we turn on the TV

15:59.492 --> 16:02.534
and watch the rest of
the game together?

16:02.536 --> 16:04.662
Great idea,
Mama!

16:04.664 --> 16:07.164
Papa likes
the idea too.

16:07.166 --> 16:11.128
Watching football with
his family is super cool.

16:13.839 --> 16:17.173
Fifi and her fishmates
are learning to share,

16:17.175 --> 16:18.885
to give and to take

16:18.887 --> 16:22.804
when Professor Shark
says, "Time for a break.

16:22.806 --> 16:26.393
"I have an important
announcement to make."

16:28.313 --> 16:30.438
Listen up, my little trolls.

16:30.440 --> 16:34.109
I have a very exciting
announcement to make.

16:35.027 --> 16:37.694
I love exciting announcements.

16:37.696 --> 16:38.488
Me too.

16:39.531 --> 16:41.158
Me three.

16:42.199 --> 16:43.576
I wonder what this announcement
could be.

16:43.578 --> 16:46.913
I bet this announcement
is something great.

16:48.041 --> 16:50.707
Well, it is exciting news.

16:50.709 --> 16:54.002
We are going on
our first field trip.

16:54.004 --> 16:55.295
Fish sticks!

16:55.297 --> 16:57.005
Fish sticks?

16:57.007 --> 16:59.217
That means oh goody.

17:01.512 --> 17:04.971
I've never been on a field
trip before.

17:04.973 --> 17:07.934
What is a field trip,
Professor Shark?

17:07.935 --> 17:10.936
A field trip is when
our whole class

17:10.939 --> 17:15.359
travels together to a new
place to explore and learn.

17:16.486 --> 17:17.901
Wow.

17:17.903 --> 17:20.862
I love exploring new places.

17:20.864 --> 17:21.738
Me too.

17:21.740 --> 17:24.699
This is going to be so much fun.

17:24.701 --> 17:27.536
Well, there's a few
important things to know

17:27.538 --> 17:30.247
before we leave
for our field trip.

17:30.249 --> 17:33.417
First, you will each
be paired with a buddy

17:33.419 --> 17:35.085
that you need to swim next to

17:35.087 --> 17:38.464
at all times during
our field trip.

17:38.466 --> 17:40.675
I hope I get to be with you,
Lily.

17:40.677 --> 17:44.512
You are my best friend
in the whole wide ocean.

17:44.514 --> 17:48.265
Oh, I hope to get to
be with you too, Fifi.

17:48.267 --> 17:49.976
Okay, Fifi and Lily.

17:49.978 --> 17:53.478
You are going to pair
up and be fish buddies.

17:53.480 --> 17:54.315
Hooray!

17:56.109 --> 17:56.943
Yippee!

17:58.611 --> 18:02.697
Trigger, you are going
to be paired with Kiki.

18:02.699 --> 18:04.323
Me and the puffer.

18:04.325 --> 18:08.076
This is going to be
fun, oh fun, oh fishes.

18:08.078 --> 18:12.290
Fin, you are going to be
paired with Sammie Swordfish.

18:12.292 --> 18:16.294
Tang, you are going to
be paired with Diesel.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.295
Me and the Tang!

18:18.297 --> 18:22.257
Pedal, you are going to
be paired with Chopper.

18:22.259 --> 18:25.343
High five flipper, Chopper.

18:25.345 --> 18:26.637
Okay, class.

18:26.639 --> 18:29.640
Now let's go around the
cove and have each of us

18:29.642 --> 18:32.351
say something nice
about our buddies.

18:32.353 --> 18:34.144
My buddy is Lily.

18:34.146 --> 18:36.147
We go everywhere together.

18:36.149 --> 18:38.983
We are like two
pearls in a clamshell.

18:42.613 --> 18:45.072
We swim and play all
day long

18:45.074 --> 18:46.910
in our beautiful reef.

18:48.369 --> 18:52.496
And my buddy Fin has
the coolest eyeglasses.

18:52.498 --> 18:53.790
He is so lucky.

18:55.334 --> 18:59.336
He has four eyes instead
of two.

19:01.632 --> 19:05.508
My buddy Tang is
brighter than the sun.

19:05.510 --> 19:08.303
I'm a mellow yellow fella

19:08.305 --> 19:11.308
and you're a fast,
fierce Manta ray.

19:12.352 --> 19:14.060
Pedal is my buddy.

19:14.062 --> 19:18.480
She's a really cool sea
turtle with awesome flippers.

19:18.482 --> 19:22.025
Trigger is the smartest
friendly seahorse in the sea

19:22.027 --> 19:25.196
and I'm so happy she's
gonna be buddies with me.

19:29.035 --> 19:31.201
The children,
now in pairs,

19:31.203 --> 19:33.537
are excited to go somewhere.

19:33.539 --> 19:37.707
Eagerly they shout, "What
is this field trip about?"

19:37.709 --> 19:40.335
Okay, my little trolls.

19:40.337 --> 19:43.214
Now all of us are with
our fish buddies, right?

19:43.216 --> 19:45.677
Yes, Professor Shark.

19:46.969 --> 19:50.388
Now can you tell us where
we're going on our field trip?

19:50.390 --> 19:52.517
Oh yes, please, tell me.

19:53.642 --> 19:58.648
We are going to swim deep
down to the bottom of the sea.

19:58.898 --> 20:01.607
There, a mysterious objects
waits for us

20:01.609 --> 20:04.067
to discover and enjoy.

20:04.069 --> 20:05.362
Ooh, ah!

20:08.658 --> 20:10.740
What kind of object?

20:10.742 --> 20:12.869
A sunken ship!

20:12.871 --> 20:14.706
Whoa, a sunken ship.

20:15.664 --> 20:19.417
Maybe we'll find
some buried treasure.

20:19.419 --> 20:22.544
This is going to be
our best adventure ever.

20:22.546 --> 20:24.213
Yay!

20:25.257 --> 20:28.175
The fish form
pairs to keep them safe,

20:28.177 --> 20:32.095
for the deep, dark sea
can be a dangerous place.

20:32.097 --> 20:34.931
But our little fishes
need not fear,

20:34.933 --> 20:39.102
for Professor Shark and
soon a surprise teacher

20:39.104 --> 20:40.772
will always be near.

20:43.942 --> 20:48.486
Two by two, now in pairs,
the students bob and dip,

20:48.488 --> 20:51.573
all eager to start their fun
field trip

20:51.575 --> 20:53.950
to see the sunken ship.

20:53.952 --> 20:56.954
I know you're
all very excited.

20:56.956 --> 20:58.581
We will be leaving
on our field trip

20:58.583 --> 21:02.168
to see the sunken ship
in just a few minutes.

21:02.170 --> 21:05.256
We are waiting for
one more surprise.

21:06.298 --> 21:08.174
Another surprise?

21:08.176 --> 21:09.425
What's that?

21:09.427 --> 21:11.427
I love surprises!

21:11.429 --> 21:12.263
Me too.

21:13.347 --> 21:14.348
Yes!

21:19.312 --> 21:20.894
Alba!

21:20.896 --> 21:21.978
Welcome.

21:21.980 --> 21:24.732
Class, I'd like
you to meet Alba.

21:24.734 --> 21:26.151
Hi, Alba.

21:27.653 --> 21:29.486
Hi, class.

21:29.488 --> 21:31.613
Alba is a white seal.

21:31.615 --> 21:34.950
She is our
new teacher assistant.

21:34.952 --> 21:36.744
What's that?

21:36.746 --> 21:40.121
A teacher assistant is
someone who helps a professor

21:40.123 --> 21:41.748
in the classroom.

21:41.750 --> 21:44.459
Alba is studying
to be a teacher.

21:44.461 --> 21:45.796
Ooh, ah!

21:49.007 --> 21:51.383
How do you learn
to be a teacher?

21:51.385 --> 21:54.178
I am studying to
be a teacher at school.

21:54.180 --> 21:57.556
I am also going to learn a
lot by helping Professor Shark

21:57.558 --> 22:00.892
and learning from all
of you amazing students.

22:00.894 --> 22:01.895
Yay!

22:03.105 --> 22:07.941
Alba is attending the famous
Aquatic Mammal University,

22:07.943 --> 22:09.611
better known as AMU.

22:11.197 --> 22:12.532
Ooh, ah!

22:15.701 --> 22:17.701
It's nice to meet you, Alba.

22:17.703 --> 22:18.996
My name is Fifi.

22:19.913 --> 22:21.496
Hello, Fifi.

22:21.498 --> 22:23.999
It's good to meet you too.

22:24.001 --> 22:25.376
My name is Lily.

22:25.378 --> 22:26.878
I'm a blue whale.

22:26.880 --> 22:28.379
Hello, Lily.

22:28.381 --> 22:31.882
Blue whales are
very special sea animals.

22:31.884 --> 22:33.050
My name is Fin.

22:33.052 --> 22:34.467
I'm Fifi's brother.

22:34.469 --> 22:37.053
I love learning about the sea.

22:37.055 --> 22:38.680
So do I, Fin.

22:38.682 --> 22:41.475
We are going to
learn a lot together.

22:41.477 --> 22:42.893
I'm Sammie Swordfish.

22:42.895 --> 22:44.896
Do you know a lot
about the sea, Alba?

22:44.898 --> 22:46.147
I do.

22:46.149 --> 22:49.233
And I can't wait to teach you
everything I know, Sammie.

22:49.235 --> 22:50.525
I'm Trigger.

22:50.527 --> 22:52.277
I'm a seahorse.

22:52.279 --> 22:54.863
I see you have four flippers.

22:54.865 --> 22:56.700
That's fish-a-docious.

22:58.702 --> 23:00.035
That's right, Trigger.

23:00.037 --> 23:01.912
I do have four flippers.

23:01.914 --> 23:03.496
I'm a seal.

23:03.498 --> 23:06.876
I am what is called a
semiaquatic marine mammal.

23:06.878 --> 23:09.754
I'm Kiki, a pufferfish.

23:09.756 --> 23:14.091
I can blow my body up
into a big round ball.

23:15.303 --> 23:17.762
Great to meet you, Kiki.

23:17.764 --> 23:21.765
My name is Pedal
and I'm a sea turtle.

23:21.767 --> 23:23.769
Some turtles are semi...

23:25.939 --> 23:28.065
Uh, semiqu, aqua, mm, uh.

23:32.111 --> 23:35.446
Yeah, what you just said,
I'm that too.

23:37.825 --> 23:40.495
S-E-M-I aquatic.

23:42.287 --> 23:43.704
That's right, Pedal.

23:43.706 --> 23:46.415
Some turtles live part
of the time in the sea

23:46.417 --> 23:48.583
and part of the time on land.

23:48.585 --> 23:49.960
My name is Diesel.

23:49.962 --> 23:51.294
I'm a Manta ray.

23:51.296 --> 23:55.675
I have a really flat body
so I can swim super fast.

23:55.677 --> 23:57.259
Can you swim fast, Alba?

23:57.261 --> 24:00.971
Yes, but maybe not
as fast as you.

24:03.559 --> 24:06.977
I'm Tang, a bright
yellow tang.

24:06.979 --> 24:09.854
Are we, are we still
going on a field trip?

24:09.856 --> 24:12.941
I hope we're still going
to see the sunken ship.

24:12.943 --> 24:15.945
Of course we are
going on a field trip.

24:15.947 --> 24:18.030
I see you are already in pairs.

24:18.032 --> 24:20.615
Are we ready to go,
Professor Shark?

24:20.617 --> 24:21.993
Yes, Alba.

24:21.995 --> 24:23.244
Ready, everyone?

24:23.246 --> 24:24.247
Yes!

24:26.082 --> 24:28.123
All the students in
the class

24:28.125 --> 24:30.751
depart for their
fun-filled trip,

24:30.753 --> 24:35.297
happily swimming two by
two to see a sunken ship.

24:35.299 --> 24:37.382
Professor Shark leads the group

24:37.384 --> 24:40.136
as they swim through
Fishtale Reef.

24:40.138 --> 24:43.054
Alba the seal swims
behind the troop

24:43.056 --> 24:45.727
as they head for the ocean deep.

24:49.855 --> 24:53.232
As the students embark on
their first field trip,

24:53.234 --> 24:56.694
they learn about people and
sunken ships.

24:59.324 --> 25:03.743
Can any of you tell me
what is a sunken ship?

25:03.745 --> 25:08.038
It's a big boat lying at
the bottom of the ocean.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.707
Very good, Fifi.

25:09.709 --> 25:12.376
What else do you know about
sunken ships?

25:12.378 --> 25:14.836
A sunken ship has
something to do

25:14.838 --> 25:17.797
with the ones that live
on top of the water.

25:17.799 --> 25:19.883
You mean people?

25:19.885 --> 25:21.094
I've seen them.

25:22.138 --> 25:23.473
Ooh, ah!

25:27.809 --> 25:29.226
People!

25:29.228 --> 25:31.646
That's a funny word.

25:31.648 --> 25:33.563
What are people?

25:33.565 --> 25:36.775
They have very long flippers

25:36.777 --> 25:40.780
that smack the water
when they try to swim.

25:40.782 --> 25:45.787
They move all around, but
don't get very far.

25:46.328 --> 25:48.411
People don't have flippers,
Pedal.

25:48.413 --> 25:49.996
They have arms.

25:51.543 --> 25:53.458
Arms!

25:53.460 --> 25:55.753
Another funny word.

25:55.755 --> 25:57.755
People arms!

25:57.757 --> 25:59.924
People arms flop and splash

25:59.926 --> 26:02.217
because people have to keep
their heads above water

26:02.219 --> 26:04.262
so they can breathe.

26:04.264 --> 26:05.929
Very good, Fin.

26:05.931 --> 26:07.681
You are so smart.

26:07.683 --> 26:10.601
People can't breathe
underwater like we can.

26:10.603 --> 26:13.979
Unless they are divers
with special equipment.

26:13.981 --> 26:15.230
Divers?

26:16.526 --> 26:19.360
Divers are people who can
swim underwater like us.

26:19.362 --> 26:21.195
Right, Professor Shark?

26:21.197 --> 26:22.405
Yes, Trigger.

26:22.407 --> 26:26.324
They are people that use
gadgets to breathe underwater

26:26.326 --> 26:28.119
for a short time.

26:28.121 --> 26:31.455
My mom saw a people
diver in the reef once.

26:31.457 --> 26:33.874
It swam right near her.

26:33.876 --> 26:35.210
Ooh, ah!

26:38.297 --> 26:42.134
What do people have
to do with sunken ships?

26:43.303 --> 26:47.929
People can't breathe
underwater, so they build ships.

26:47.931 --> 26:49.515
That's right, Chopper.

26:49.517 --> 26:54.061
A boat is something people use
to travel across the water.

26:54.063 --> 26:57.148
Part of the boat sticks out of
the water.

26:57.150 --> 26:59.734
People stay on this
part of the ship.

26:59.736 --> 27:02.527
The other part of the
boat is under the water.

27:02.529 --> 27:05.948
That is the part of the ship
that sails through the water.

27:06.784 --> 27:08.492
Ships swim like us?

27:08.494 --> 27:10.620
Cool!

27:11.873 --> 27:13.831
I guess you could say that.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.874
There are many kinds of boats.

27:15.876 --> 27:20.045
Some boats are small and
some boats are very big.

27:20.047 --> 27:22.172
Big boats are called ships.

27:22.174 --> 27:25.801
That is what
we're going to see.

27:25.803 --> 27:29.304
But we're going to see a
sunken ship?

27:29.306 --> 27:32.225
How did the ship get to
the bottom of the ocean?

27:32.227 --> 27:34.601
Good question, Fin.

27:34.603 --> 27:38.104
People build boats to
sail on top of the water.

27:38.106 --> 27:40.024
But sometimes these big ships

27:40.026 --> 27:42.360
don't stay on top of the water.

27:42.362 --> 27:45.862
They sink to the
bottom of the sea.

27:45.864 --> 27:48.448
Do people live
in sunken ships?

27:48.450 --> 27:51.409
No, people don't live in
sunken ships.

27:51.411 --> 27:54.746
But lots of fish live in
and around sunken ships.

27:54.748 --> 27:55.997
Fish sticks!

27:55.999 --> 27:58.001
I love meeting new fish.

27:58.878 --> 28:02.045
Are there a lot of
sunken ships in the ocean?

28:02.047 --> 28:05.006
There are millions
of sunken ships.

28:05.008 --> 28:06.425
Millions!

28:06.427 --> 28:08.846
That's a really big number.

28:10.556 --> 28:13.351
I can't even
count to a million.

28:14.227 --> 28:17.227
Why do so many
of these ships sink?

28:17.229 --> 28:20.438
Don't people know how to
keep ships on top of water?

28:21.817 --> 28:23.692
There are many
reasons ships sink

28:23.694 --> 28:25.570
to the bottom of the ocean.

28:25.572 --> 28:30.533
Strong storm winds can blow
a ship in the wrong direction

28:30.535 --> 28:32.659
and people get lost.

28:32.661 --> 28:36.872
Oh, I would not like
to get lost in the ocean.

28:36.874 --> 28:38.332
Me neither, Fifi.

28:38.334 --> 28:40.042
It would be scary.

28:40.044 --> 28:42.253
It can be scary, Lily.

28:42.255 --> 28:44.755
Lightning can break
a ship into two.

28:44.757 --> 28:46.049
Ooh, ah!

28:49.304 --> 28:51.262
The bottom of the
ship can hit a rock

28:51.264 --> 28:53.014
that people don't see.

28:53.016 --> 28:55.390
The rock punches
a hole in the boat.

28:55.392 --> 28:57.267
The boat sinks.

28:57.269 --> 29:01.479
You can find sunken
ships all over the ocean

29:01.481 --> 29:03.858
and we are very lucky

29:03.860 --> 29:06.861
because we are
going to see one today.

29:09.449 --> 29:12.490
As the students
continue their fun field trip,

29:12.492 --> 29:16.411
they are eager to
see the sunken ship.

29:17.664 --> 29:20.332
Everyone stares
at the sunken ship.

29:20.334 --> 29:22.126
It is big and shiny.

29:22.128 --> 29:23.669
The top of it dips.

29:23.671 --> 29:26.796
One object catches all their
fish eyes,

29:26.798 --> 29:31.094
a treasure chest filled
with gold coins that shines.

29:35.767 --> 29:38.309
So shiny and pretty.

29:38.311 --> 29:39.976
What is it?

29:39.978 --> 29:41.519
Buried treasure.

29:41.521 --> 29:45.524
My dad and I love to
search for buried treasure.

29:45.526 --> 29:46.441
Buried?

29:46.443 --> 29:49.027
It's spread all
over the ocean floor.

29:51.865 --> 29:53.823
What is a treasure?

29:53.825 --> 29:56.576
Something very special.

29:56.578 --> 30:00.665
A treasure can be gold, jewels,
and gems.

30:00.667 --> 30:04.084
But it can also be something
that is important to someone.

30:04.086 --> 30:06.754
Like my stuffed
starfish pillow?

30:06.756 --> 30:08.132
I love my pillow.

30:09.092 --> 30:10.259
It is so soft!

30:11.510 --> 30:14.719
I don't think I could sleep
without my little starfish.

30:14.721 --> 30:18.140
Your stuffed starfish
pillow is a treasure to you.

30:18.142 --> 30:20.685
What are those shiny objects?

30:20.687 --> 30:22.852
They are called coins.

30:22.854 --> 30:23.981
Gold coins!

30:24.856 --> 30:27.858
They are gold and shiny.

30:27.860 --> 30:30.861
There are so many of them.

30:30.863 --> 30:35.073
There are a lot of gold coins
spilling out of that chest.

30:35.075 --> 30:37.534
That's called
a treasure chest.

30:37.536 --> 30:39.203
Fish dazzle!

30:39.205 --> 30:42.038
I think I've seen gold coins in
our reef.

30:42.040 --> 30:44.166
Gold coins in the reef?

30:44.168 --> 30:45.458
Where?

30:45.460 --> 30:48.461
I have seen gold coins in
that little pond of water

30:48.463 --> 30:49.964
near the playground.

30:49.966 --> 30:52.550
When the sunlight shines
through the water,

30:52.552 --> 30:54.886
it really lights up.

30:54.888 --> 30:57.554
Oh yes, I've seen it too.

30:57.556 --> 31:00.517
When the sun shines,
the gold glows.

31:02.061 --> 31:04.227
I love swimming there.

31:04.229 --> 31:05.064
Me too.

31:06.065 --> 31:08.565
My dad and I like
to hunt for treasure.

31:08.567 --> 31:11.944
When we find some,
we kick sand on it.

31:14.574 --> 31:16.239
Why do you and your dad
kick sand

31:16.241 --> 31:18.325
on the gold coins, Chopper?

31:18.327 --> 31:21.370
We like to bury it so
no one else can find it.

31:21.372 --> 31:23.538
It's lots of fun.

31:23.540 --> 31:25.082
You and your dad
would have fun

31:25.084 --> 31:26.833
burying these gold coins.

31:26.835 --> 31:28.294
There are so many of them.

31:30.965 --> 31:34.425
Professor Shark,
I have a question.

31:34.427 --> 31:37.222
How did those
gold coins get here?

31:41.017 --> 31:43.601
Fish play, my dear Tang.

31:43.603 --> 31:47.229
Inspector Pedal is here
to solve the mystery

31:47.231 --> 31:51.068
of the gold coins.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.614
What do you think,
Inspector Pedal?

31:57.616 --> 32:00.700
Do you see any clues.

32:00.702 --> 32:05.208
Hmm, I think the sunken
ship is a clue, Doctor Kiki.

32:06.334 --> 32:08.124
The sunken ship is a clue?

32:08.126 --> 32:10.460
That is a really big clue!

32:12.757 --> 32:13.965
It is.

32:13.967 --> 32:16.007
But look, Doctor Kiki,

32:16.009 --> 32:19.637
there are some coins on
the main part of the boat.

32:19.639 --> 32:21.973
The main part of the
boat is called the hull.

32:21.975 --> 32:23.349
Right, Professor Shark?

32:23.351 --> 32:24.850
That's right, Diesel.

32:24.852 --> 32:28.563
The main part of a boat is
called a hull.

32:28.565 --> 32:30.480
Continue, Inspector Pedal.

32:32.651 --> 32:35.486
See those gold
coins in the hull?

32:35.488 --> 32:38.030
The coins left a trail,

32:38.032 --> 32:42.325
a trail that leads from the
boat to the sandy bottom.

32:42.327 --> 32:43.662
Ooh, ah!

32:46.999 --> 32:50.709
I do see a trail of gold
coins, Inspector Pedal.

32:50.711 --> 32:52.669
Then you can see that the
treasure chest

32:52.671 --> 32:55.255
fell off the ship when it sunk.

32:55.257 --> 32:58.258
It fell off the
ship and hit the ground.

32:58.260 --> 33:01.803
It hit the
ground and broke open.

33:01.805 --> 33:04.180
You did it again,
Inspector Pedal.

33:04.182 --> 33:06.102
You solved the mystery.

33:07.186 --> 33:09.355
Fish play, my dear Fifi.

33:13.901 --> 33:17.986
Now we know why the treasure
chest landed on the ground.

33:20.033 --> 33:21.990
Yes, we do, Tang.

33:21.992 --> 33:23.409
Very good, Pedal.

33:23.411 --> 33:26.370
You are going to
make a great detective.

33:26.372 --> 33:30.207
I don't think I've ever
met such a smart sea turtle.

33:30.209 --> 33:32.001
Shall we explore some more?

33:32.003 --> 33:33.004
Yes!

33:35.215 --> 33:37.380
The fish
swim two by two

33:37.382 --> 33:39.633
as they search the ocean blue,

33:39.635 --> 33:42.637
not knowing inside
the sunken ship

33:42.639 --> 33:46.059
lies the best part of their
amazing trip.

33:48.769 --> 33:51.312
Time to explore the sunken ship.

33:51.314 --> 33:56.191
There are plants and wheels
and chairs and boots.

33:56.193 --> 34:00.487
There's pictures of pirates,
world globes and maps.

34:00.489 --> 34:03.365
They even found a captain's hat.

34:03.367 --> 34:06.785
Chains and masts,
gold on the floor.

34:06.787 --> 34:11.581
But wait, they're about
to discover so much more.

34:11.583 --> 34:12.417
Wow!

34:13.877 --> 34:15.710
So much to look at.

34:15.712 --> 34:17.672
What's that, Professor Shark?

34:17.674 --> 34:20.007
It's called a globe.

34:20.009 --> 34:23.928
It shows all the land
and oceans of the Earth.

34:23.929 --> 34:25.888
What's the Earth?

34:25.889 --> 34:27.389
It's where we live.

34:29.935 --> 34:33.270
That globe looks like a
ball I use to play soccer.

34:35.942 --> 34:37.817
What's that?

34:37.819 --> 34:39.402
That is a pirate.

34:39.404 --> 34:41.112
What's a pirate?

34:41.114 --> 34:44.781
It is one of those people
that lives above the sea.

34:44.783 --> 34:46.701
Right, Professor Shark?

34:46.703 --> 34:48.118
That's right, Pedal.

34:48.120 --> 34:51.413
A pirate is a person that sails
the sea

34:51.415 --> 34:54.125
looking for gold and treasure.

34:54.127 --> 34:58.295
Looks like this pirate
found a lot of gold.

34:58.297 --> 34:59.922
Did you see that?

34:59.924 --> 35:01.549
Something moved!

35:01.551 --> 35:03.466
I did see something move.

35:03.468 --> 35:05.094
What do you think it is?

35:05.096 --> 35:06.764
Let's swim closer.

35:11.935 --> 35:13.143
Hi.

35:13.145 --> 35:14.439
Hi, I'm Fifi.

35:15.564 --> 35:16.897
I'm Lily.

35:16.899 --> 35:18.774
My name is Cheri.

35:18.776 --> 35:20.192
You live here?

35:20.194 --> 35:21.359
Yes.

35:21.361 --> 35:25.948
I moved here with my family
from a reef far, far away.

35:25.950 --> 35:28.658
You live in the sunken ship?

35:28.660 --> 35:29.618
Yes.

35:29.620 --> 35:31.411
I am a stingray.

35:31.413 --> 35:35.040
My parents said it is good
to live in a sunken ship.

35:35.042 --> 35:37.792
There are some yummy
plants here to eat.

35:37.794 --> 35:40.922
There are also many
plants that are soft

35:40.924 --> 35:43.507
and make a nice bed to sleep on.

35:43.509 --> 35:45.509
You are a stingray?

35:45.511 --> 35:48.011
We have a Manta ray
in our class.

35:48.013 --> 35:49.846
His name is Diesel.

35:49.848 --> 35:51.850
He sings so beautifully.

35:53.727 --> 35:55.353
Do you sing, Cheri?

35:56.230 --> 35:58.230
I sing sometimes.

35:58.232 --> 36:02.484
But the fish swim away.

36:02.486 --> 36:04.737
Stingrays are like Manta rays.

36:04.739 --> 36:09.033
But I have a stinger at the
end of my tail.

36:09.035 --> 36:10.118
Ooh!

36:11.703 --> 36:14.413
What are you doing in the
sunken ship?

36:14.415 --> 36:18.208
We are on a field trip with
our class.

36:18.210 --> 36:21.712
Fifi, Lily, I've been looking
for you.

36:21.714 --> 36:24.214
All the other fish swam the
other way.

36:24.216 --> 36:25.507
Sorry, Alba.

36:25.509 --> 36:28.094
We were just saying
hello to Cheri.

36:28.096 --> 36:31.721
Cheri is from a reef far,
far away.

36:31.723 --> 36:33.181
Hello, Cheri.

36:33.183 --> 36:34.683
My name is Alba.

36:34.685 --> 36:36.226
Are you a seal?

36:36.228 --> 36:38.270
Yes, I am a seal.

36:38.272 --> 36:39.897
Are you a stingray?

36:39.899 --> 36:41.107
Yes.

36:41.109 --> 36:44.442
I heard there's going to
be a new student, a stingray,

36:44.444 --> 36:46.152
joining our class.

36:46.154 --> 36:49.031
Cheri is going to
be in our class?

36:49.033 --> 36:51.241
That is very good news.

36:51.243 --> 36:54.995
Oh yes, I would very much
like to be in your class.

36:54.997 --> 36:56.039
Yay!

36:57.165 --> 36:58.708
Cheri is here with her parents

36:58.710 --> 37:01.335
to learn about life in
Fishtale Reef.

37:01.337 --> 37:03.962
What is it like in your reef,
Cheri?

37:03.964 --> 37:07.216
It is a little bit warmer
and greener,

37:07.218 --> 37:12.304
but the plants here are so
yummy in my tummy.

37:12.306 --> 37:13.892
Alba, Fifi, Lily!

37:15.225 --> 37:16.933
We're waiting for you.

37:16.935 --> 37:19.312
Professor Shark is calling us.

37:19.314 --> 37:21.730
Who is Professor Shark?

37:21.732 --> 37:26.359
He is the best teacher
in the whole wide ocean.

37:26.361 --> 37:28.446
You are going to love him.

37:28.448 --> 37:31.073
Everybody loves
Professor Shark.

37:31.075 --> 37:32.116
Let's go.

37:32.118 --> 37:33.868
He's waiting for us.

37:33.870 --> 37:36.453
See you in class, Cheri.

37:36.455 --> 37:38.874
See you soon in our lagoon.

37:42.085 --> 37:44.837
The sunken
ship was really fun.

37:44.839 --> 37:47.964
But even better was
meeting someone,

37:47.966 --> 37:50.926
another fun fish
to be their classmate,

37:50.928 --> 37:53.764
and Fifi and Lily
just can't wait.

37:56.850 --> 37:59.643
Fifi and Lily, best of friends,

37:59.645 --> 38:02.855
always together through thick
and thin.

38:02.857 --> 38:06.150
But now and then even best
friends fight,

38:06.152 --> 38:09.280
only to make up
and set things right.

38:10.906 --> 38:12.949
I'm so happy you could come to
my house

38:12.951 --> 38:14.908
to play today, Lily.

38:14.910 --> 38:18.622
You are my very best
friend in all the ocean.

38:19.998 --> 38:24.042
And you are my very best
friend in the whole wide sea.

38:24.044 --> 38:27.837
And today we have all
afternoon to play.

38:30.301 --> 38:32.176
What do you
want to play, Fifi?

38:32.178 --> 38:34.261
What do you
want to play, Lily?

38:34.263 --> 38:36.596
I know, let's watch TV.

38:36.598 --> 38:40.560
Let's watch that funny
show with dancing snails.

38:40.562 --> 38:44.105
I don't feel like watching TV,
Lily.

38:44.107 --> 38:46.065
Do you want to play a game?

38:46.067 --> 38:48.275
What game do you want to play?

38:48.277 --> 38:50.321
Let's play Fishtopolis!

38:51.321 --> 38:53.071
Is that the game
where you name

38:53.073 --> 38:55.533
as many sea animals as you can?

38:55.535 --> 38:58.034
Yes, we take turns.

38:58.036 --> 39:00.705
The one who names
the most sea animals

39:00.707 --> 39:03.748
becomes fish queen for a day.

39:05.210 --> 39:08.337
Uh, I don't feel like playing.

39:08.339 --> 39:09.504
I know.

39:09.506 --> 39:12.884
We can go to the playground
and see if Kiki and Pedal

39:12.886 --> 39:15.386
want to swim on the
merry-go-round.

39:15.388 --> 39:17.513
We just saw Kiki and Pedal.

39:17.515 --> 39:19.848
They went to Pedal's
house to play.

39:19.850 --> 39:22.225
What do you want to do?

39:22.227 --> 39:25.980
I want to watch that
funny fish show on TV.

39:25.982 --> 39:28.651
I don't feel like watching TV.

39:29.944 --> 39:32.027
I don't feel
like playing Fishtopolis.

39:32.029 --> 39:34.362
I don't feel like
going to the playground.

39:34.364 --> 39:37.741
You never want to do
anything I want to do.

39:37.743 --> 39:40.786
Or you never want to
do anything I want to do.

39:40.788 --> 39:43.121
I want to play a game.

39:43.123 --> 39:45.458
I want to watch TV.

39:45.460 --> 39:46.711
I'm going home.

39:57.931 --> 39:59.265
Was that Lily?

40:00.350 --> 40:03.808
I thought you two were
playing here this afternoon.

40:03.810 --> 40:08.605
Lily wants to watch a TV
show about dancing snails.

40:08.607 --> 40:10.775
I thought you liked to watch
the TV show

40:10.777 --> 40:12.944
about dancing snails.

40:12.946 --> 40:16.406
I do, but today I wanted to
play a game.

40:17.951 --> 40:22.118
I thought Lily was your best
friend in the entire ocean.

40:22.120 --> 40:25.915
She is my best friend
in the entire ocean.

40:25.917 --> 40:30.920
Sometimes to be a good
friend, you have to compromise.

40:30.922 --> 40:32.504
What's that?

40:32.506 --> 40:34.632
Compromise means
finding something

40:34.634 --> 40:37.009
that will make
both of you happy.

40:37.011 --> 40:39.679
I want to play Fishtopolis.

40:39.681 --> 40:42.138
I want to go to the playground.

40:42.140 --> 40:44.101
Lily wants to watch TV.

40:45.143 --> 40:47.562
Why can't you
agree to do both?

40:47.564 --> 40:50.982
You can watch the TV show
about dancing snails,

40:50.984 --> 40:54.150
then you can play a
game of Fishtopolis

40:54.152 --> 40:56.237
or go to the playground.

40:56.239 --> 40:57.073
Oh!

40:58.073 --> 40:59.656
I see.

40:59.658 --> 41:01.785
We can watch TV and play?

41:03.036 --> 41:04.245
Yes.

41:04.247 --> 41:07.040
That would make
both of you happy.

41:09.502 --> 41:11.919
Where are you going, Fifi?

41:11.921 --> 41:14.254
I'm going to find Lily, Mama.

41:23.348 --> 41:25.308
Lily, I'm sorry.

41:25.310 --> 41:27.851
Please come to my house to play.

41:27.853 --> 41:31.397
We can watch the TV show
about dancing snails.

41:31.399 --> 41:33.399
I'm sorry too, Fifi.

41:33.401 --> 41:36.777
I would be happy to go to your
house and play Fishtopolis.

41:36.779 --> 41:38.737
Why don't we do both?

41:38.739 --> 41:41.406
Yes, we can do both.

41:41.408 --> 41:46.203
You're my best friend in
the whole wide ocean, Lily.

41:46.205 --> 41:50.082
You're my best friend
in the big open sea, Fifi.

41:50.084 --> 41:52.167
Even if we get mad
at each other,

41:52.169 --> 41:54.629
we will always be best friends.

41:54.631 --> 41:57.005
You got that right.

41:58.009 --> 42:00.509
Fifi and
Lily swim home together,

42:00.511 --> 42:04.054
friends through good
times and stormy weather.

42:04.056 --> 42:06.806
And even though they'll
sometimes fight,

42:06.808 --> 42:10.479
they'll always make up
and set things right.

42:14.024 --> 42:18.152
Thanksgiving in Fishtale
Reef is a time to give thanks

42:18.154 --> 42:20.071
for the ocean deep.

42:20.073 --> 42:23.491
Plants and food
and coral galore,

42:23.493 --> 42:27.328
friends and family
and so much more.

42:27.330 --> 42:30.288
Thanks to the animals
who discovered the reef,

42:30.290 --> 42:34.585
gratitude, blessings
for creating the beach.

42:43.596 --> 42:48.598
Happy Thanksgiving
and Reef Discovery Day,

42:48.600 --> 42:50.394
my young sea animals.

42:51.770 --> 42:55.315
Today we give thanks
for our wonderful home

42:56.859 --> 42:58.236
in Fishtale Reef.

42:59.779 --> 43:02.739
May a warm ocean
wave wash over you.

43:10.832 --> 43:12.584
Happy Thanksgiving!

43:14.294 --> 43:17.837
Happy Thanksgiving,
Professor Shark.

43:17.839 --> 43:19.922
Happy Thanksgiving.

43:19.924 --> 43:22.799
Happy Thanksgiving,
Alba.

43:22.801 --> 43:27.471
Can anyone tell me what we
celebrate on Thanksgiving Day?

43:27.473 --> 43:30.725
It is a day we give thanks
for everything we have

43:30.727 --> 43:32.350
in Fishtale Reef.

43:32.352 --> 43:35.187
A day we get to
eat a lot of food.

43:37.817 --> 43:39.859
A day we celebrate
the first animals

43:39.861 --> 43:42.319
who lived on Fishtale Reef.

43:42.321 --> 43:45.071
All very good answers!

43:45.073 --> 43:49.409
In honor of the first sea animals
that discovered our reef,

43:49.411 --> 43:51.995
I would like to go
around the classroom

43:51.997 --> 43:54.498
and have each
of you say something

43:54.500 --> 43:58.294
you give thanks for on this
special day.

43:58.296 --> 43:59.502
I'll start.

43:59.504 --> 44:03.007
I am so thankful for the
clear water in our reef.

44:03.009 --> 44:06.509
It is warm to swim in
and delicious to drink.

44:08.848 --> 44:13.141
I am thankful for all the
plants that live in our reef.

44:13.143 --> 44:15.895
I am thankful for all the
colorful coral

44:15.897 --> 44:17.437
that live in our reef.

44:17.439 --> 44:19.857
I am thankful for all
the fish and sea animals

44:19.859 --> 44:21.442
that live in our reef.

44:21.444 --> 44:24.527
I am thankful for the
sea grass in our reef.

44:24.529 --> 44:26.658
It is so soft to sleep on.

44:28.033 --> 44:30.201
I am thankful for all the
yummy food

44:30.203 --> 44:31.618
we have on our reef.

44:34.207 --> 44:37.542
I am thankful for the
sandy bottom in our reef.

44:37.544 --> 44:39.585
It is soft to bounce on.

44:39.587 --> 44:41.087
Wishy wonk!

44:41.089 --> 44:46.174
I am thankful for my seahorse
family, algae, and seaweed

44:46.176 --> 44:49.219
that let me wrap my
tail around its branches

44:49.221 --> 44:50.888
and hang upside down.

44:50.890 --> 44:54.766
I am thankful for all
the colors in our reef.

44:54.768 --> 44:58.478
I like to find coral and
plants that are bright yellow,

44:58.480 --> 44:59.563
like me,

44:59.565 --> 45:02.065
and play hide and seek
with the other fish.

45:02.067 --> 45:05.611
It is very hard to find me.

45:05.613 --> 45:08.906
I am thankful for all
the fun things in our reef.

45:08.908 --> 45:11.241
We can play on the
merry-go-round.

45:11.243 --> 45:13.326
We can play in a sunken ship.

45:13.328 --> 45:15.245
We can chase bubbles!

45:17.625 --> 45:20.917
I am thankful for
the ocean waves.

45:20.919 --> 45:24.379
I like to jump out of
the water and ride them.

45:24.381 --> 45:26.841
I am thankful for the
reef rocks.

45:26.843 --> 45:29.759
I like to sun myself and get
very dry

45:29.761 --> 45:32.054
before jumping
back into the sea.

45:32.056 --> 45:34.431
Your turn, Professor Shark.

45:34.433 --> 45:36.600
What are you thankful for?

45:36.602 --> 45:39.104
I am thankful for sea caves.

45:40.439 --> 45:43.565
I like to swim and hide
in caves.

45:43.567 --> 45:44.900
And I'm also thankful

45:44.902 --> 45:48.739
for all of my little
seabees in class co four.

45:51.743 --> 45:52.744
Yay!

45:53.870 --> 45:56.661
There is so much to be
thankful for you.

45:56.663 --> 45:58.998
Professor Shark and I
have written a little song

45:59.000 --> 46:01.042
for this special day.

46:01.044 --> 46:02.337

Everyone agrees,

46:51.218 --> 46:56.096
on Thanksgiving Day, being
thankful is the Fishtale way.

46:56.098 --> 46:59.350
So stick around, don't go away,

46:59.352 --> 47:02.187
for soon it will be
Christmas Day.

47:06.149 --> 47:09.192
It's Saturday, then Sunday.

47:09.194 --> 47:12.279
There's no school till Monday.

47:12.281 --> 47:14.906
Fifi and Fin have nothing to do.

47:14.908 --> 47:18.870
But what do you do when
there is no school?

47:18.872 --> 47:20.330
No school today!

47:21.207 --> 47:23.165
What should we do, Fin?

47:23.167 --> 47:24.625
I don't know.

47:24.627 --> 47:26.710
Want to go to the playground?

47:26.712 --> 47:30.172
I can play with Lily and
you can play with Sammie.

47:30.174 --> 47:31.716
I don't know.

47:31.718 --> 47:34.759
Do you want to swim
around the reef?

47:34.761 --> 47:37.471
We could play hide
and seek in the coral.

47:37.473 --> 47:38.763
Maybe.

47:38.765 --> 47:40.850
Want to go shopping in town?

47:40.852 --> 47:44.978
Mama and Papa left us some
fish chips to buy something.

47:44.980 --> 47:46.397
I don't know.

47:46.399 --> 47:49.775
Want to have lunch
at the Fish Bake Cafe?

47:49.777 --> 47:51.192
I don't know.

47:51.194 --> 47:53.237
Fin, come on!

47:53.239 --> 47:55.114
Stop being glum.

47:55.116 --> 47:57.366
It's Saturday and Sunday.

47:57.368 --> 48:00.161
Time for us to have fun!

48:00.163 --> 48:02.830
I don't know what I
feel like doing today.

48:02.832 --> 48:04.748
I have an idea.

48:04.750 --> 48:07.250
Let's do everything!

48:07.252 --> 48:10.129
We can swim anywhere we want.

48:10.131 --> 48:11.589
Anywhere?

48:11.591 --> 48:14.132
Anywhere, everywhere.

48:14.134 --> 48:15.842
That's what I say.

48:15.844 --> 48:19.096
So much to do in just one day.

48:19.098 --> 48:21.893
So many places to visit
and play.

48:28.107 --> 48:29.565
Look, Fin.

48:29.567 --> 48:32.652
We can play and swim
around the playground.

48:32.654 --> 48:33.944
Good idea, Fifi.

48:33.946 --> 48:35.862
I love the playground.

48:35.864 --> 48:39.368
We can swim back and forth,
up and down.

48:40.995 --> 48:43.161
It's so much fun, Fin.

48:43.163 --> 48:44.915
No reason to be down.

48:45.959 --> 48:47.290
You're the best, Fifi.

48:47.292 --> 48:48.960
This is awesome.

48:48.962 --> 48:49.796
Whee!

48:53.424 --> 48:55.132
I'm hungry.

48:55.134 --> 48:57.634
Let's swim into town.

48:57.636 --> 48:58.761
I'm hungry too.

48:58.763 --> 48:59.886
Let's go.

48:59.888 --> 49:01.763
See ya later!

49:01.765 --> 49:03.891
Catch a fin, guys.

49:10.274 --> 49:12.817
What do you feel like eating,
Fin?

49:12.819 --> 49:15.569
I would like to eat at
Catfish Shack.

49:15.571 --> 49:17.612
That's a great idea.

49:17.614 --> 49:19.198
Let's go.

49:19.200 --> 49:20.785
Look, there's Tang!

49:21.785 --> 49:25.288
We were going to get something
to eat at the Catfish Shack.

49:25.290 --> 49:29.500
I was swimming there to
get something to eat too.

49:29.502 --> 49:31.419
Want to race?

49:31.421 --> 49:33.004
Sure.

49:33.006 --> 49:34.922
I'll start the race.

49:34.924 --> 49:35.757
Ready.

49:37.009 --> 49:37.843
Set.

49:38.886 --> 49:39.720
Go!

49:59.698 --> 50:02.866
What did you do today
while we were at work?

50:02.868 --> 50:04.201
Did you have fun?

50:04.203 --> 50:05.913
You tell them, Fin.

50:06.788 --> 50:09.290
I thought there was nothing to
do today.

50:09.292 --> 50:12.000
Then Fifi said let's go out
and play.

50:12.002 --> 50:14.712
First, we had fun on the
merry-go-round.

50:14.714 --> 50:17.380
Then we went to town
and raced around.

50:17.382 --> 50:20.217
We went for lunch,
ate seaweed dip,

50:20.219 --> 50:23.554
then onto an adventure in a
sunken ship.

50:23.556 --> 50:27.098
I had so much fun with
Fifi and friends.

50:27.100 --> 50:30.270
I want to wake up
and do it all again.

50:32.147 --> 50:34.607
Fin thanks Fifi,
his sister,

50:34.609 --> 50:36.400
of that he's glad,

50:36.402 --> 50:39.948
for tomorrow is Sunday,
more fun to be had.

50:43.243 --> 50:46.118
Valentine's Day in Fishtale Reef

50:46.120 --> 50:50.080
begins with a lesson
that all elders preach.

50:50.082 --> 50:51.375
Be kind, behave,

50:52.292 --> 50:53.794
be good, be smart,

50:54.712 --> 50:58.757
be a friendly little fish
with a great big heart.

51:17.944 --> 51:22.739
Happy Fishy Heart
Day, my young sea animals.

51:23.908 --> 51:28.413
Today we celebrate love and
kindness in Fishtale Reef.

51:32.250 --> 51:35.253
May a warm ocean wave
wash over you.

51:43.176 --> 51:45.178
Happy Fishy Heart Day!

51:46.723 --> 51:51.141
Happy Fishy Heart
Day, Professor Shark.

51:51.143 --> 51:53.435
Happy Fishy Heart Day.

51:53.437 --> 51:58.151
Or as seals who sun ourselves
on rocks above the sea say,

51:59.402 --> 52:01.237
happy Valentine's Day!

52:02.154 --> 52:05.115
Happy Valentine's Day,
Alba!

52:06.075 --> 52:09.493
Can anyone tell me about Fishy
Heart Day

52:09.495 --> 52:11.038
or Valentine's Day?

52:13.498 --> 52:15.833
It is a day we
love each other.

52:15.835 --> 52:18.044
A day we are
nice to each other.

52:18.046 --> 52:20.337
A day for kindness.

52:20.339 --> 52:22.172
Very good.

52:22.174 --> 52:25.634
In honor of this
wonderful holiday,

52:25.636 --> 52:28.554
I would like to go
around the classroom

52:28.556 --> 52:33.266
and have each of you say
something nice to each other.

52:33.268 --> 52:34.560
I'll start.

52:34.562 --> 52:37.312
I love everyone in this class.

52:40.526 --> 52:42.402
You, uh, you love me?

52:43.696 --> 52:45.154
I do.

52:45.156 --> 52:46.824
That's, uh, funny.

52:47.783 --> 52:51.368
There are all kinds of love,
Sammie.

52:51.370 --> 52:54.120
I love all of my students too.

52:54.122 --> 52:56.290
All kinds of love?

52:56.292 --> 52:57.583
Yes.

52:57.585 --> 53:00.627
There is the way you love
your mother and father,

53:00.629 --> 53:02.922
the way you love your brother,

53:02.924 --> 53:05.424
the way you love
your best friend.

53:05.426 --> 53:08.553
Like I love Lily!

53:08.555 --> 53:11.429
I love you too, Fifi!

53:11.431 --> 53:14.602
Eh, do I have to
say I love someone?

53:16.603 --> 53:18.062
No, Fin.

53:18.064 --> 53:21.232
You could say something
nice about someone.

53:22.234 --> 53:23.984
You could tell a
story about someone

53:23.986 --> 53:26.112
who did something nice for you.

53:26.114 --> 53:28.406
Sammie shares his
lunch with me.

53:28.408 --> 53:29.406
That's cool.

53:29.408 --> 53:31.701
Fin helps me do homework.

53:31.703 --> 53:33.743
That's very nice.

53:33.745 --> 53:36.746
Kiki and me like
to play together.

53:36.748 --> 53:39.960
I pretend I'm the great
Inspector Pedal

53:41.087 --> 53:42.714
who solves mystery.

53:43.797 --> 53:46.632
And Pedal pretends
I'm his assistant,

53:46.634 --> 53:49.342
the smartest ever Doctor Kiki.

53:49.344 --> 53:50.763
Oh, that's fun.

53:52.098 --> 53:53.263
Fishy wonk.

53:53.265 --> 53:56.100
Tang said he likes
the way I talk.

53:56.102 --> 53:59.853
Trigger said she
likes my spiked fin.

53:59.855 --> 54:02.857
Everyone in the class
likes the way I sing.

54:02.859 --> 54:03.860
Yes!

54:05.569 --> 54:09.112
You are all such nice,
kind fish.

54:10.950 --> 54:13.993
Professor Shark and I
wrote a song for you.

54:13.995 --> 54:14.996
Yay!

54:16.080 --> 54:19.957

54:19.959 --> 54:21.708

with a great big heart.

54:48.071 --> 54:50.029
Great big heart.

54:50.031 --> 54:50.862
Yeah.

54:50.864 --> 54:53.368
This is the best class ever!

54:56.411 --> 55:00.748
Everyone agrees,
fish school is a breeze.

55:00.750 --> 55:03.542
The students are
having so much fun.

55:03.544 --> 55:07.212
Stick around, there's
so much more to come.

55:08.216 --> 55:11.174
Professor Shark
quiets the class.

55:11.176 --> 55:13.386
He has something to say.

55:13.388 --> 55:17.141
He's going to talk about
show and tell today.

55:20.645 --> 55:23.020
Good morning, class.

55:23.022 --> 55:26.357
Good morning,
Professor Shark.

55:26.359 --> 55:29.234
What are we going to do
today, Professor Shark?

55:29.236 --> 55:33.739
Today we are going to
talk about show and tell.

55:33.741 --> 55:35.283
Show and tell?

55:35.285 --> 55:36.491
What is that?

55:36.493 --> 55:38.870
Ooh, I know, I know!

55:38.872 --> 55:40.996
Okay, Trigger, tell us.

55:40.998 --> 55:42.998
What is show and tell?

55:43.000 --> 55:46.085
Show and tell is when we
bring something to class to show

55:46.087 --> 55:48.379
and then we tell
everyone about it.

55:48.381 --> 55:50.380
Very good, Trigger.

55:50.382 --> 55:52.299
Can you give us an example?

55:52.301 --> 55:53.842
I'm a seahorse.

55:53.844 --> 55:55.553
I have a curly tail.

55:55.555 --> 55:58.054
I brought my tail to class.

56:00.643 --> 56:04.185
I brought my tail to class
so I can show it to you.

56:04.187 --> 56:07.024
Then I can tell you
about my tail.

56:08.484 --> 56:12.029
I can move my curly
tail this way and that.

56:12.946 --> 56:17.908
I can wrap my tail around
plants and hang upside down.

56:20.245 --> 56:22.372
I can show my blowhole.

56:23.332 --> 56:25.084
What is a blowhole?

56:26.044 --> 56:28.460
I am not a fish like you,
Tang.

56:28.462 --> 56:31.172
I do not have
gills to breathe underwater.

56:31.174 --> 56:33.089
You're not a fish?

56:33.091 --> 56:34.591
I am not a fish.

56:34.593 --> 56:35.719
I am a mammal.

56:36.596 --> 56:38.638
Mammals need to breathe air.

56:38.640 --> 56:41.598
I breathe air in
and out of my blowhole.

56:41.600 --> 56:44.560
That's wishy-fishy cool.

56:44.562 --> 56:48.940
I would like to show
everyone my eyeglasses.

56:48.942 --> 56:52.275
I need to wear eyeglasses
so I can see better.

56:52.277 --> 56:54.071
Trigger, Lily, Fin!

56:55.364 --> 56:58.241
These are all very good ideas.

56:58.243 --> 57:01.826
But I was thinking about
another kind of show and tell.

57:01.828 --> 57:04.455
What kind of show and
tell, Professor Shark?

57:04.457 --> 57:08.583
I was thinking we could
spend the rest of the day

57:08.585 --> 57:11.089
swimming around Fishtale Reef!

57:12.256 --> 57:13.880
Swimming around the reef?

57:14.801 --> 57:16.049
Ooh!

57:17.178 --> 57:20.136
Cool, I love swimming around
the reef.

57:20.138 --> 57:21.721
Oh, me too.

57:21.723 --> 57:25.560
This is going to be
the best school day ever!

57:25.562 --> 57:27.564
School is so much fun.

57:31.817 --> 57:33.984
Good morning, class.

57:33.986 --> 57:36.779
Good morning, Alba.

57:36.781 --> 57:39.323
Professor Shark said we
are going to spend the day

57:39.325 --> 57:41.033
swimming around the reef.

57:41.035 --> 57:43.159
That sounds like fun.

57:43.161 --> 57:47.330
We are not just going to
swim around the reef, class.

57:47.332 --> 57:50.250
We are going to swim
around the reef

57:50.252 --> 57:54.422
and look for something
special to bring to class

57:54.424 --> 57:56.634
for show and tell tomorrow.

57:57.593 --> 58:00.011
Like a treasure hunt?

58:00.013 --> 58:02.304
I love treasure hunts.

58:02.306 --> 58:03.471
Me too.

58:03.473 --> 58:04.683
Me too.

58:05.810 --> 58:07.685
What kind of treasure should
we look for

58:07.687 --> 58:10.353
to bring to show and
tell, Professor Shark?

58:10.355 --> 58:14.442
Something you think is
interesting and special.

58:14.444 --> 58:15.859
Can it be a plant?

58:15.861 --> 58:16.986
Yes.

58:16.988 --> 58:20.989
There are many interesting
plants in Fishtale Reef.

58:20.991 --> 58:23.201
Can it be a rock?

58:23.203 --> 58:24.701
Of course.

58:24.703 --> 58:27.120
There are so many
beautiful treasures

58:27.122 --> 58:29.166
to find in Fishtale Reef.

58:30.667 --> 58:34.045
This is going to be
so much fun.

58:34.047 --> 58:38.424
If each of you is ready,
I'll sound the field trip bell.

58:38.426 --> 58:40.176
Let's go find something special

58:40.178 --> 58:42.386
for tomorrow's show and tell.

58:46.017 --> 58:47.600
Everyone's
searching.

58:47.602 --> 58:49.476
What will they find?

58:49.478 --> 58:53.440
Can't wait till tomorrow
for show and tell time.

58:57.819 --> 59:01.571
Fifi and Lily swim through
Fishtale Reef

59:01.573 --> 59:06.537
for show and tell tomorrow,
something special they seek.

59:07.747 --> 59:10.248
This is so much fun.

59:10.250 --> 59:14.085
I love looking for show and
tell ideas with you, Lily.

59:14.087 --> 59:17.587
I love looking for show and
tell ideas with you too, Fifi.

59:17.589 --> 59:21.216
You are my best friend
in the whole wide ocean.

59:21.218 --> 59:25.264
And you are my best
friend in the big blue sea.

59:26.683 --> 59:28.348
I have an idea.

59:28.350 --> 59:30.893
Let's look for some blue coral.

59:30.895 --> 59:33.314
That is a great idea, Fifi.

59:37.777 --> 59:40.694
Is blue your favorite color,
Lily?

59:40.696 --> 59:43.614
Yes, I do love the color blue.

59:43.616 --> 59:45.699
What is your favorite color,
Fifi?

59:45.701 --> 59:48.159
I like blue too, Lily.

59:48.161 --> 59:51.205
But my favorite color is pink.

59:51.207 --> 59:53.165
I like the color pink too.

59:53.167 --> 59:56.919
That's why I like hanging out
with you.

59:56.921 --> 59:58.712
I have an idea.

59:58.714 --> 01:00:02.216
Let's try to find some blue and
pink coral

01:00:02.218 --> 01:00:03.967
for show and tell.

01:00:03.969 --> 01:00:06.304
That's a great idea, Fifi.

01:00:06.306 --> 01:00:10.600
Maybe there is some blue and
pink coral by the old cave.

01:00:10.602 --> 01:00:11.518
Let's go.

01:00:20.694 --> 01:00:23.529
Maybe we will see
Old Bennie the Fish.

01:00:23.531 --> 01:00:27.368
He is the best cave
gardener in all the ocean.

01:00:28.785 --> 01:00:32.078
Oh yes, Old Bennie the
Fish takes very good care

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:34.248
of all the plants, seaweed,
and coral

01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:35.750
that live in the cave.

01:00:35.752 --> 01:00:37.667
I'm sure he will know where we
can find

01:00:37.669 --> 01:00:41.422
some blue and pink coral
for show and tell tomorrow.

01:00:41.424 --> 01:00:45.509
Should we call his name
and see if he's here?

01:00:45.511 --> 01:00:47.469
Bennie!

01:00:47.471 --> 01:00:48.473
Bennie Fish!

01:00:54.478 --> 01:00:55.728
Hi, Bennie.

01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:58.355
Yes, we were calling your name.

01:00:58.357 --> 01:01:02.025
Professor Shark told us
to swim through the reef

01:01:02.027 --> 01:01:03.944
and look for something special

01:01:03.946 --> 01:01:06.739
to bring to class tomorrow
for show and tell.

01:01:06.741 --> 01:01:08.199
Show and tell.

01:01:08.201 --> 01:01:10.909
Now, that sounds
like a lot of fun.

01:01:10.911 --> 01:01:11.993
How can I help?

01:01:11.995 --> 01:01:14.163
I was hoping to find
some blue coral

01:01:14.165 --> 01:01:16.623
to bring to class with
me for show and tell.

01:01:16.625 --> 01:01:20.002
I was hoping to
find pink coral.

01:01:20.004 --> 01:01:21.087
Hmm.

01:01:21.089 --> 01:01:25.468
It takes a very special fish
and a very special whale

01:01:27.053 --> 01:01:29.554
to search for blue
and pink coral.

01:01:29.556 --> 01:01:31.763
It is not easy to find.

01:01:31.765 --> 01:01:35.600
Do you know where blue
and pink coral live, Bennie?

01:01:35.602 --> 01:01:39.062
Blue and pink coral like
to live in clear water

01:01:39.064 --> 01:01:41.315
that is not very deep.

01:01:41.317 --> 01:01:43.900
They like a lot of sunshine.

01:01:43.902 --> 01:01:45.569
Thanks, Bennie.

01:01:45.571 --> 01:01:48.531
Those are very good clues.

01:01:48.533 --> 01:01:50.408
Yes, thanks, Bennie.

01:01:50.410 --> 01:01:53.493
I think I know a place
where the water is clear

01:01:53.495 --> 01:01:55.078
and not very deep.

01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:57.415
Rock Ledge Beach.

01:01:57.417 --> 01:01:58.708
Right, Lily?

01:01:58.710 --> 01:02:01.377
Yes, Rock Ledge Beach
gets the most sunshine

01:02:01.379 --> 01:02:03.712
in all Fishtale Reef.

01:02:03.714 --> 01:02:06.718
Have fun exploring,
Fifi and Lily.

01:02:16.477 --> 01:02:17.643
Hi, Lily.

01:02:17.645 --> 01:02:19.228
Hi, Fifi.

01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:21.147
What are you looking for?

01:02:21.149 --> 01:02:22.732
Hi, Alba.

01:02:22.734 --> 01:02:25.859
We are looking for
pink and blue coral.

01:02:25.861 --> 01:02:28.446
Pink and blue coral?

01:02:28.448 --> 01:02:31.031
That is very hard to find.

01:02:31.033 --> 01:02:32.699
It is.

01:02:32.701 --> 01:02:35.578
We thought we could
find some near the cave.

01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:39.415
We didn't find any coral,
but we did find Bennie Fish.

01:02:39.417 --> 01:02:41.958
He said pink and blue
corals like to live in water

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:43.794
that is not very deep.

01:02:43.796 --> 01:02:47.089
Bennie Fish also said
pink and blue corals

01:02:47.091 --> 01:02:50.801
like to live in water
that is warm from the sun.

01:02:50.803 --> 01:02:55.806
I know where the water is
clear, warm, and not too deep.

01:02:55.808 --> 01:02:57.141
Where?

01:02:57.143 --> 01:02:58.102
Follow me.

01:03:00.187 --> 01:03:02.522
It's beautiful here, Alba.

01:03:03.982 --> 01:03:07.150
I see so many colors of coral.

01:03:07.986 --> 01:03:09.487
Look, Lily!

01:03:09.489 --> 01:03:10.365
Blue coral.

01:03:14.076 --> 01:03:15.995
I see pink coral too.

01:03:18.455 --> 01:03:20.163
Good job.

01:03:20.165 --> 01:03:23.125
You two are very good explorers.

01:03:23.127 --> 01:03:25.752
Professor Shark is
going to be very excited

01:03:25.754 --> 01:03:29.007
to see what you have for show
and tell.

01:03:30.218 --> 01:03:33.219
Fifi can't
wait for show and tell.

01:03:33.221 --> 01:03:38.015
Finding blue and pink coral
with Lily has been swell.

01:03:38.017 --> 01:03:41.893
Another amazing adventure
in Fishtale Reef.

01:03:41.895 --> 01:03:46.066
Now it's time to go home
and get something to eat.

01:03:48.944 --> 01:03:51.737
It's Trigger's turn for
show and tell

01:03:51.739 --> 01:03:54.991
and she has a
wonderful tale to tell.

01:03:54.993 --> 01:03:59.370
She has cousins so tiny
they are hard to see.

01:03:59.372 --> 01:04:04.250
Blending in coral, there
are one, two, and three.

01:04:04.252 --> 01:04:06.877
Pygmy seahorses they are called.

01:04:06.879 --> 01:04:08.879
See if you can find them.

01:04:08.881 --> 01:04:10.340
They are so small.

01:04:11.718 --> 01:04:13.511
Good morning, class.

01:04:14.428 --> 01:04:17.846
Good morning,
Professor Shark.

01:04:17.848 --> 01:04:20.852
Today we have a
very exciting day.

01:04:22.395 --> 01:04:25.187
It is Trigger's turn
for show and tell

01:04:25.189 --> 01:04:29.442
and she has brought some
very special guests to visit.

01:04:29.444 --> 01:04:30.777
Ooh, ah!

01:04:35.908 --> 01:04:38.241
Happy coralicious day,
everyone.

01:04:38.243 --> 01:04:41.078
For show and tell today,
I brought in my cousins,

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:43.082
Pammy, Tammy, and Hammy.

01:04:45.877 --> 01:04:48.087
Um, I don't see anything.

01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:51.422
I don't see anything either.

01:04:51.424 --> 01:04:53.341
What do your
cousins look like?

01:04:53.343 --> 01:04:57.805
They look kind of like me,
but they are very little.

01:04:59.265 --> 01:05:02.475
Tell us more about
Pammy, Tammy, and Hammy.

01:05:04.395 --> 01:05:08.940
Pammy, Tammy, and Hammy
are pygmy seahorses.

01:05:08.942 --> 01:05:11.067
Pygmy seahorses?

01:05:11.069 --> 01:05:12.777
Pygmy means small.

01:05:12.779 --> 01:05:13.655
Oh!

01:05:16.241 --> 01:05:17.739
I don't see them.

01:05:17.741 --> 01:05:21.453
Are you sure they are
sitting on the coral?

01:05:22.872 --> 01:05:25.580
Maybe they swam away.

01:05:25.582 --> 01:05:27.708
No, they are right here.

01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:29.669
They are just hard to see.

01:05:29.671 --> 01:05:33.339
Tell us why they are
hard to see, Trigger.

01:05:33.341 --> 01:05:34.507
They are hard to see

01:05:34.509 --> 01:05:37.342
because they are the
same color as the coral.

01:05:37.344 --> 01:05:38.680
Ooh, ah!

01:05:41.808 --> 01:05:45.141
If the coral is pink,
they are pink?

01:05:45.143 --> 01:05:46.435
Yes.

01:05:46.437 --> 01:05:49.813
If the coral color is
yellow, they are yellow?

01:05:49.815 --> 01:05:50.982
That's right.

01:05:50.984 --> 01:05:53.650
My pygmy seahorse cousins like
to blend in

01:05:53.652 --> 01:05:55.987
with the color of the coral they
live on.

01:05:55.989 --> 01:05:56.948
Wow!

01:05:58.323 --> 01:06:00.908
If they are the
same color as coral,

01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:02.701
how can we see them?

01:06:02.703 --> 01:06:05.372
You have to look very closely.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.546
Pammy, Tammy, Hammy, can you
please say hi to everyone?

01:06:15.174 --> 01:06:17.757
Hi, my name is Pammy.

01:06:17.759 --> 01:06:19.176
Ahoy, fishmates.

01:06:19.178 --> 01:06:20.511
I'm Hammy.

01:06:22.973 --> 01:06:25.977
Hi, Tammy,
Hammy, and Pammy.

01:06:27.352 --> 01:06:29.353
I do see them.

01:06:29.355 --> 01:06:30.773
They are so cute.

01:06:31.857 --> 01:06:33.982
They look like you, Trigger.

01:06:33.984 --> 01:06:36.277
Only they are much smaller.

01:06:36.279 --> 01:06:38.194
Are they babies?

01:06:38.196 --> 01:06:40.698
Will they get bigger when they
grow up?

01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:42.866
I am not a baby!

01:06:42.868 --> 01:06:45.036
We are older
than cousin Trigger.

01:06:45.038 --> 01:06:46.245
That's right.

01:06:46.247 --> 01:06:49.873
Pammy, Tammy, and Hammy
might be smaller than me,

01:06:49.875 --> 01:06:52.792
but they are my older cousins.

01:06:52.794 --> 01:06:55.420
They are a mini you.

01:06:57.549 --> 01:07:00.592
No, Pedal, they are
not a mini me.

01:07:00.594 --> 01:07:03.261
They are a different
kind of seahorse.

01:07:03.263 --> 01:07:05.265
Pygmy seahorses!

01:07:06.142 --> 01:07:09.726
Thank you for bringing your
cousin in for show and tell.

01:07:09.728 --> 01:07:14.607
It was very interesting to
learn about pygmy seahorses.

01:07:14.609 --> 01:07:16.567
They are the cutest.

01:07:19.739 --> 01:07:22.739
Pygmy
seahorses for show and tell.

01:07:22.741 --> 01:07:25.951
Discovering them has
really been swell.

01:07:25.953 --> 01:07:28.870
New sea creatures
to meet and learn.

01:07:28.872 --> 01:07:31.625
Amazing fish
everywhere you turn.

01:07:35.171 --> 01:07:38.047
Above the ocean
in people's minds,

01:07:38.049 --> 01:07:42.759
it's Easter Bunny, funny
hats, and egg hunting time.

01:07:42.761 --> 01:07:46.263
But below the ocean in
Fishtale Reef,

01:07:46.265 --> 01:07:50.768
it's the hidden oyster
pearl that everyone seeks.

01:08:00.821 --> 01:08:04.992
Happy spring,
my little sea urchins.

01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:09.497
It's time for the annual
oyster pearl hunt,

01:08:11.457 --> 01:08:14.502
a very exciting day
in Fishtale Reef.

01:08:17.087 --> 01:08:21.341
Who will find the biggest
and best pearl this year?

01:08:24.095 --> 01:08:26.386
Good luck to all of you.

01:08:26.389 --> 01:08:29.392
May a warm ocean
wave wash over you.

01:08:34.397 --> 01:08:36.232
Happy spring, class.

01:08:37.567 --> 01:08:40.737
Happy spring,
Professor Shark.

01:08:41.778 --> 01:08:44.281
Today is a very special day.

01:08:46.158 --> 01:08:48.743
Could anyone tell me why?

01:08:48.745 --> 01:08:50.868
Today we swim through the reef

01:08:50.871 --> 01:08:54.788
and try to find the
biggest and best pearl.

01:08:54.791 --> 01:08:55.874
That's right.

01:08:55.876 --> 01:08:59.379
Today our oyster friends open
their shells

01:09:00.215 --> 01:09:03.384
and show us their
pearl hidden inside.

01:09:04.719 --> 01:09:06.054
Ooh, ah!

01:09:13.353 --> 01:09:15.393
Happy spring, class.

01:09:15.395 --> 01:09:18.939
Or as the people who
live above the sea say,

01:09:18.942 --> 01:09:20.649
happy Easter!

01:09:20.652 --> 01:09:22.526
Happy spring, Alba!

01:09:22.528 --> 01:09:23.571
Happy Easter.

01:09:26.866 --> 01:09:30.033
On Easter,
people hunt for eggs.

01:09:30.036 --> 01:09:34.082
In Fishtale Reef, we look
for big, bright pearls.

01:09:34.957 --> 01:09:37.582
Why does the pearl have
to be big and bright?

01:09:37.585 --> 01:09:39.921
Oyster pearls are magical.

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:44.714
If we find a large, bright pearl

01:09:44.716 --> 01:09:48.636
it means spring will
bring mild weather.

01:09:48.638 --> 01:09:52.682
And plenty of food for
everyone all summer long.

01:09:52.684 --> 01:09:53.685
Yay!

01:09:54.769 --> 01:09:58.521
Can anyone tell me
what pearls look like?

01:09:58.523 --> 01:09:59.981
They're round.

01:09:59.983 --> 01:10:04.696
Some are round, but pearls
can also form uneven shapes.

01:10:06.863 --> 01:10:08.698
They are white.

01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:13.537
Some are white, but pearls
come in all different colors.

01:10:14.746 --> 01:10:17.664
There are gray pearls,
blue pearls,

01:10:17.666 --> 01:10:19.877
green pearls, black pearls.

01:10:21.004 --> 01:10:23.920
That's a lot of colors.

01:10:23.922 --> 01:10:25.213
It is.

01:10:25.215 --> 01:10:27.926
Pearls are shiny
and beautiful.

01:10:29.136 --> 01:10:30.468
Right, Alba?

01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:31.928
Yes, Pedal.

01:10:31.930 --> 01:10:35.391
Pearls are shimmery
and very special.

01:10:35.393 --> 01:10:37.935
How do we get oysters
to open their shells

01:10:37.937 --> 01:10:39.936
and show us their pearls?

01:10:39.938 --> 01:10:42.774
We have to ask
them very nicely.

01:10:44.943 --> 01:10:48.029
But first we have
to find them.

01:10:48.864 --> 01:10:51.949
Oysters are shy sea animals.

01:10:51.951 --> 01:10:54.619
They like to hide in the reef.

01:10:54.621 --> 01:10:56.954
We have to be very quiet.

01:10:56.956 --> 01:10:59.080
And when we find an oyster,

01:10:59.082 --> 01:11:02.793
we have to be very polite and
say please.

01:11:02.795 --> 01:11:06.129
And if an oyster doesn't
want to open its shell,

01:11:06.131 --> 01:11:08.259
we must swim away quietly.

01:11:10.385 --> 01:11:12.762
Why won't an oyster
open its shell?

01:11:12.764 --> 01:11:15.222
Not all oysters have pearls.

01:11:15.224 --> 01:11:18.642
Finding an oyster
with a big, bright pearl

01:11:18.644 --> 01:11:20.602
is going to be hard.

01:11:20.604 --> 01:11:22.271
Hard, but fun.

01:11:22.273 --> 01:11:24.731
It's like a treasure hunt.

01:11:24.733 --> 01:11:27.317
We will swim
together as a class.

01:11:27.319 --> 01:11:29.445
Is everyone ready?

01:11:29.447 --> 01:11:30.406
Yes!

01:11:32.533 --> 01:11:37.244
Bellowing whale should sound
the start bell any second.

01:11:41.166 --> 01:11:42.208
There it is.

01:11:42.210 --> 01:11:43.625
Let's go!

01:11:50.385 --> 01:11:52.053
I think I see one.

01:12:00.687 --> 01:12:05.358
Oyster lying in the sea,
please show your pearl to me.

01:12:20.706 --> 01:12:22.914
Can I try, Professor Shark?

01:12:22.916 --> 01:12:24.374
Go ahead, Fifi.

01:12:24.376 --> 01:12:26.878
Oyster lying in the sea,

01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:30.174
please, will you show
your pearl to me?

01:12:32.926 --> 01:12:36.887
Look, the oyster is
opening its shell.

01:12:36.889 --> 01:12:38.223
Ooh, ah!

01:12:41.394 --> 01:12:43.688
It's so beautiful.

01:12:44.647 --> 01:12:46.649
It is beautiful.

01:12:51.069 --> 01:12:52.235
They did it.

01:12:52.237 --> 01:12:57.201
They found it, a perfect pearl
lying on the ocean floor.

01:12:57.660 --> 01:12:58.825
It's spring.
