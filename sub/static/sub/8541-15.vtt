00:17.365 --> 00:19.062
Whoo!

00:19.149 --> 00:21.499
Feel alive!

00:21.586 --> 00:22.761
- Agent Lisbon?
- Hey.

00:22.848 --> 00:25.068
Patrick Jane, consultant.

00:25.155 --> 00:26.461
- Hello.
- Morning, sheriff.

00:26.548 --> 00:29.377
Hi. Trey Hughes.
Thanks for coming. It's, uh..

00:29.464 --> 00:31.944
- Tell us about the victim.
- Look. Hawks.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.468
Family of hawks.
Oh, they're gone.

00:33.555 --> 00:35.122
- Rick Loomis.
- Wow.

00:35.209 --> 00:38.647
Been in town five months.
Dead in his truck by the creek.

00:38.734 --> 00:40.953
Well, maybe he died
of happiness.

00:41.041 --> 00:44.000
Too much natural beauty.
It's the Stendhal syndrome.

00:44.087 --> 00:45.654
- No
- No?

00:45.741 --> 00:48.309
- He was shot in the head.
- Oh, well. Never mind.

00:49.658 --> 00:51.486
Beautiful!

[Teresa]
'Who found the body
all the way out here?'

00:53.923 --> 00:57.448
Another prospector saw Loomis '
body in the truck yesterday.

00:57.535 --> 00:58.841
Thought he was sleeping.

00:58.928 --> 01:00.582
Then, she came back this morning

01:00.669 --> 01:03.498
and saw him and checked
and saw he was shot dead.

01:03.585 --> 01:05.978
- A prospector, you say?
- Yeah, for gold.

01:06.066 --> 01:09.808
A guy discovered trace gold in
these hills about a year ago.

01:09.895 --> 01:11.767
Got on the TV news about it.

01:11.854 --> 01:14.248
Folks haven't stopped
comin' ever since.

01:14.335 --> 01:16.076
- Like a gold rush.
- Mm-hmm.

01:18.339 --> 01:21.298
- Yeah, well.
- Gold's over $1300 an ounce.

01:21.385 --> 01:24.780
And unemployment's
at 12 percent.

01:24.867 --> 01:28.044
Got a lot of hard-nosed,
well motivated folks here.

01:28.131 --> 01:30.090
'I don't blame 'em.'

01:30.177 --> 01:32.004
Poor souls are gonna
be disappointed.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.094
Poor souls?
There's no gold?

01:34.181 --> 01:37.532
Oh, yeah, there's still some in
the stream bed. Always has been.

01:37.619 --> 01:41.536
But...it's not enough to pay
for your lodging, food

01:41.623 --> 01:43.364
if you work hard to get it

01:43.451 --> 01:45.540
'but there's no
El Dorado here.'

01:45.627 --> 01:47.977
I tell 'em that
but they don't listen.

01:48.064 --> 01:51.981
- Murder weapon?
- Nothin' yet.

01:52.068 --> 01:55.289
Hey, fellas. How about
you look around for the gun?

- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

[jazz music]

02:16.745 --> 02:18.312
Sorry. Sorry.

02:21.010 --> 02:22.533
I didn't touch a thing.

02:24.448 --> 02:26.015
Our victim liked
smooth jazz

02:26.102 --> 02:28.757
yet his radio station
was tuned to heavy metal.

02:28.844 --> 02:30.585
Which suggests that
the jazz-hating killer

02:30.672 --> 02:34.589
popped out the cd and found
music more to his taste

02:34.676 --> 02:36.547
while he drove
the truck over here.

02:36.634 --> 02:38.897
Probably, with the victim
already dead in the back.

02:38.984 --> 02:41.248
I'll have forensics
dust for prints.

[Melinda]
'Excuse me! Excuse me!'

02:43.467 --> 02:47.819
- Excuse me. Hi.
- Hi, Melinda.

02:47.906 --> 02:51.910
That's Melinda. She's the one
who found Loomis' body.

02:51.997 --> 02:53.782
- Hi. Melinda Drew.
- Hi.

02:53.869 --> 02:56.045
Um, you guys aren't gonna
be much longer, are you?

02:56.132 --> 02:57.699
I mean, no disrespect
to the dead fella

02:57.786 --> 02:59.353
but we're losing daylight.

02:59.440 --> 03:03.270
We'll do the best we can. Ma'am,
just stay behind the tape.

03:03.357 --> 03:05.010
Now, when did you first
see the truck?

03:05.097 --> 03:07.535
Uh, truck was here when
I started work yesterday

03:07.622 --> 03:08.971
around 6:00 a.m.

03:09.058 --> 03:11.539
And did Mr. Loomis
work up here often?

03:11.626 --> 03:14.890
Uh, no, I-I haven't seen him
around here in a while.

03:14.977 --> 03:17.327
May we get back to work
now, ma'am? Please?

03:17.414 --> 03:21.157
It'll be soon, I expect. Just
stay behind the yellow tape.

Gold!

03:22.941 --> 03:24.160
Hey, that's my equipment.

- There's more!
- CBI!

- Oh, it's so cool!
- That's mine!

[Teresa]
'Relax. Now, we're not
gonna do anything.'

03:31.341 --> 03:33.169
- They're letting her in!
- Hey! That belongs to me!

03:33.256 --> 03:35.519
No! No, there are..
This is a..

03:35.606 --> 03:37.565
- This is a crime scene.
- Hey! Hold on. Hey!

03:37.652 --> 03:39.001
- Ow!
- Oh!

03:39.088 --> 03:42.831
Are you insane?
Ow. Ah, my ankle.

03:42.918 --> 03:44.441
I'm fine.
Aah!

03:47.314 --> 03:49.881
[theme music]

04:02.807 --> 04:05.114
- It's red. That's good.
- 'How can red be good?'

04:05.201 --> 04:08.073
Well, blue means torn ligaments
and red means it's a sprain.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.945
Sprain can be
as bad as a break.

04:10.032 --> 04:14.515
It's not sprained. Let's focus
here. Job, murder, talk to me.

04:14.602 --> 04:16.517
Rick Loomis, 43,
moved to Hadley six months ago

04:16.604 --> 04:18.040
with his son
and girlfriend.

04:18.127 --> 04:20.216
lives in a trailer home
near the gold panning creek.

04:20.303 --> 04:22.653
We got something in the kill
shot. Bullet's from a Colt 45.

04:22.740 --> 04:25.134
- A colt? How wild westy.
- Yup.

04:25.221 --> 04:28.485
Plus, a lack of blood in the
truck bed means Jane was right.

04:28.572 --> 04:30.966
The victim was shot somewhere
else and driven to the creek.

04:31.053 --> 04:32.881
- Any prints?
- Only the victim's.

04:32.968 --> 04:35.231
He's been dead awhile.
Coroner says, two days at least.

04:35.318 --> 04:37.494
I'll head back to Hadley,
Coral, Jane, go and see

04:37.581 --> 04:39.583
the girlfriend and the son,
the guy's gone for two days

04:39.670 --> 04:41.324
and they don't
report him missing?

04:41.411 --> 04:43.544
Rigsby and I can go.
You should stay off that ankle.

04:43.631 --> 04:47.156
I'm fine. I'll go.
Agent Hightower. Hi.

04:47.243 --> 04:49.376
Um, I heard
you took a fall.

04:49.463 --> 04:52.640
I'm fine.
Ow! I'm fine.

04:56.513 --> 04:58.428
So, I pull out the topo map?

04:58.515 --> 05:00.822
There's a creek running
right through the claim.

05:00.909 --> 05:02.171
I found a nugget
the first day.

05:02.258 --> 05:04.042
'Yeah, once you get
that first hit'

05:04.129 --> 05:06.480
it's like a drug.
I mean, you just can't stop.

05:06.567 --> 05:08.525
Yeah, it sounds exciting.

05:08.612 --> 05:10.919
So, can I just show up
and start panning or digging

05:11.006 --> 05:12.529
or what have you,
or do I need a permit

05:12.616 --> 05:14.531
or a license or something?
Check.

05:14.618 --> 05:16.620
No, all you got to do
to stake a claim

05:16.707 --> 05:19.449
is find open public land,
and then you got to mark it

05:19.536 --> 05:21.233
and register with
the government and stuff.

05:21.321 --> 05:24.019
- Five.
- I'll call that.

05:24.106 --> 05:25.934
Wes Attwood will sell you one
that's already registered, too

05:26.021 --> 05:29.241
if you want. It saves
you time. Raise you ten.

05:29.329 --> 05:33.898
Ahem, okay, well.
Uh, I'm gonna see your 15

05:33.985 --> 05:37.859
and I'm gonna
raise you...the same.

05:37.946 --> 05:39.513
Sheriff says there's
nothing up there.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.080
He says that you guys
are just kidding yourselves.

05:42.167 --> 05:45.693
- Yeah, he would say that.
- He would?

05:45.780 --> 05:47.259
'All these town people
own claims'

05:47.347 --> 05:48.957
up in these hills
themselves so..

05:49.044 --> 05:51.438
Exactly and they wanna
keep it all for themselves.

05:51.525 --> 05:54.092
- I'm gonna call you.
- Stands to reason.

05:54.179 --> 05:55.442
[car horn blaring]

05:56.573 --> 05:59.141
Oh, that's my ride.

05:59.228 --> 06:02.013
Well, folks, uh,
it's been fun--

06:02.100 --> 06:03.711
- What?
- I have to go.

06:03.798 --> 06:05.626
Well, come on.
You can't just leave.

06:05.713 --> 06:07.454
We barely took
any of your money.

06:07.541 --> 06:11.327
Two pair, busted flush,
pair of jacks.

06:13.808 --> 06:16.114
Don't let us keep you.

06:16.201 --> 06:18.160
Hey, Lisbon.

06:18.247 --> 06:20.554
But no. Hightower.

06:22.294 --> 06:24.122
I didn't even know
you had legs.

06:24.209 --> 06:26.081
Let's go.

06:26.168 --> 06:27.299
What were you doing
back there?

06:27.387 --> 06:28.823
Five card draw.

06:28.910 --> 06:31.652
- For money?
- No. For gold.

06:31.739 --> 06:35.307
Oh, gold. Gold.
That makes it alright, then.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.787
And gossip.

06:36.874 --> 06:39.703
Victim Rick Loomis was
a former software developer.

06:39.790 --> 06:41.488
Came up here after
he got laid off.

06:41.575 --> 06:43.838
His girlfriend
is Cheryl Meade.

06:43.925 --> 06:46.231
They've been together
since his divorce.

06:46.318 --> 06:48.843
Rick enjoyed working on
his truck with his son Jeff.

06:48.930 --> 06:51.802
Age 17 and smart,
but a little hostile.

06:53.587 --> 06:55.327
You seem a little
keyed up, Madeleine.

06:56.677 --> 06:58.505
Something wrong?

06:58.592 --> 07:01.116
- Something personal?
- None of your business.

07:02.683 --> 07:04.075
Okay.

07:04.162 --> 07:06.774
We're sorry for your loss,
Miss Meade, Jeff

07:06.861 --> 07:09.429
but we need to know
why you didn't file a missing

07:09.516 --> 07:11.039
person's report for Rick.

07:11.126 --> 07:14.129
Well, Rick had been, uh,
mining off the grid recently

07:14.216 --> 07:17.828
away from his regular
claim near the creek.

07:17.915 --> 07:20.135
Sometimes my dad would
be gone for a few days

07:20.222 --> 07:23.051
and he'd never call
to let us know.

07:23.138 --> 07:28.622
Good school. How's it been
going? Your dad's gold claim?

07:28.709 --> 07:31.625
- Great at first..
- Then nothing but mud.

07:33.409 --> 07:34.715
It would've come
good eventually.

07:34.802 --> 07:36.543
He would have
hit pay dirt.

07:36.630 --> 07:38.109
Wes Attwood sell
him that claim?

07:38.196 --> 07:39.415
Yeah, Mr. Attwood.

07:39.502 --> 07:41.852
Did, um, Rick carry
a gun with him

07:41.939 --> 07:43.854
when he would go
off by himself?

07:43.941 --> 07:45.552
No. Rick didn't
believe in guns.

07:45.639 --> 07:48.380
- He didn't think guns exist?
- He didn't like them.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.252
Me neither.
Terribly dangerous.

07:50.339 --> 07:52.384
Have you seen the statistics
on police shootings?

07:52.472 --> 07:55.649
One bullet out of every
ten hits a bad guy.

07:55.736 --> 07:59.217
And that's the trained people.
No offense.

07:59.304 --> 08:01.481
This is not useful.
Can I go now?

08:03.221 --> 08:04.875
Yeah, sure.

08:10.315 --> 08:12.361
It was Rick's idea
to come out here, wasn't it?

08:12.448 --> 08:14.494
To follow the gold dream.

08:14.581 --> 08:17.409
When Rick had a passion,
there was no stopping him.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.194
I loved that about him.

08:19.281 --> 08:22.458
You had to give up a successful
career of your own.

08:22.545 --> 08:26.027
High-end sales
type of business.

08:26.114 --> 08:28.899
Following someone else's
dream must be, uh..

08:28.986 --> 08:30.553
...at times,
a little frustrating.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.163
'We've all
made sacrifices.'

08:32.250 --> 08:35.384
Jeff put off
going to college.

08:35.471 --> 08:38.039
Oh, Rick raided
the college fund, did he?

08:38.126 --> 08:41.564
Yeah. We're broke.
Okay, we're flat broke. But..

08:44.175 --> 08:45.873
We had each other.

08:47.309 --> 08:49.006
[sobbing]

08:49.093 --> 08:50.225
Cheryl, look at me.

08:50.312 --> 08:51.792
[sniffling]

08:51.879 --> 08:54.055
There's no need to pretend,
and I mean that

08:54.142 --> 08:58.929
in the nicest possible way
but there's a whole lot of guilt

08:59.016 --> 09:00.540
in there with that grief.

09:00.627 --> 09:03.891
And just a smidgen,
just a smidgen of relief.

09:05.153 --> 09:07.329
Right?
Were you cheating on Loomis?

09:07.416 --> 09:08.504
- Patrick!
- No!

09:08.591 --> 09:10.506
Okay, just a thought.

09:10.593 --> 09:12.029
You're guilty
about something.

09:12.116 --> 09:14.597
Where were you on Monday night
when he was murdered?

09:14.684 --> 09:17.687
I was-I was at
the diner, waitressing.

09:17.774 --> 09:19.210
I can't believe that you think
that I would hurt him.

09:19.297 --> 09:22.779
Alright. Okay, I'll be
leaving right now. Sorry.

09:25.434 --> 09:28.132
There was no reason
to treat her disrespectfully.

09:28.219 --> 09:29.873
I was probing her.

09:29.960 --> 09:32.746
A certain amount of disrespect
is necessary. It's, uh..

09:32.833 --> 09:34.748
It's like getting
frisked at the airport.

09:37.185 --> 09:40.275
Probing. Alright.

09:40.362 --> 09:43.626
Okay. Well, she did seem like
she was hiding something.

09:43.713 --> 09:45.497
I'll get the team to look
into her financials

09:45.585 --> 09:47.151
while we talk
to Sheriff Hughes.

09:47.238 --> 09:49.284
Well, that sounds fun, I bet
there's a good diner in town

09:49.371 --> 09:50.546
where you can
drop me off.

09:50.633 --> 09:52.592
I bet there is.
Why don't I do that?

09:52.679 --> 09:55.595
Tell a lot about a place
by the quality of the eggs.

10:00.425 --> 10:02.253
Checked into
the bank records.

10:02.340 --> 10:05.692
Victim had an account with
his girlfriend, all of $88.32.

10:05.779 --> 10:07.432
Here's the thing,
Cheryl Meade

10:07.519 --> 10:10.087
she had a separate account
her name only, over 5 grand.

10:10.174 --> 10:12.437
The girlfriend? She told
Hightower she was flat broke.

10:12.524 --> 10:14.178
She lied.

10:14.265 --> 10:16.137
She also bought a one-way ticket
to San Francisco a week ago.

10:16.224 --> 10:17.617
Maybe, she wanted
to put some distance

10:17.704 --> 10:19.053
between herself
and a dead boyfriend.

10:19.140 --> 10:20.663
Rick Loomis recently
bought a gun.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.578
Colt 45. Same make
as the murder weapon.

10:22.665 --> 10:24.449
The girlfriend told Hightower
Loomis didn't own one.

10:24.536 --> 10:26.103
So, either she knew
about it or she--

10:26.190 --> 10:28.192
- She's lying about that
- Let's bring her in here.

10:28.279 --> 10:30.194
Don't worry, boss.
We already got it covered.

10:30.281 --> 10:36.026
Okay. I'll just stay here
and, um...not do anything.

10:36.113 --> 10:38.202
[Patrick]
'Hello?'

10:38.289 --> 10:41.292
Mr. Attwood? Anyone home?

10:41.379 --> 10:43.643
I'm Wes Attwood.
How you doing?

10:43.730 --> 10:46.471
- You're the police, right?
- Well, more of a hobbyist.

10:46.558 --> 10:48.778
Patrick Jane. Your assistant
told me where to find you.

10:48.865 --> 10:51.259
Hey, I'm Dean Puttock.
Nice to meet you.

10:51.346 --> 10:53.087
After I sell
you a claim

10:53.174 --> 10:55.263
Dean will sell you anything
you need to find gold.

10:55.350 --> 10:57.831
Sluices, high-bankers, pans.

10:57.918 --> 10:59.702
- He's the go-to guy.
- That's right.

10:59.789 --> 11:02.444
We got a 10 percent off sale
on pumps all week long, so..

11:02.531 --> 11:03.880
Good to know.

11:03.967 --> 11:05.534
Yeah. I gotta get
back to the shop.

11:05.621 --> 11:07.144
You guys need anything, lemme
know. Good seein' you.

11:07.231 --> 11:09.277
- Nice to meet you.
- 'Nice to meet you, too, Dean.'

11:09.364 --> 11:11.148
Hey, you folks mind
if I join you?

11:11.235 --> 11:12.976
'Just to get a feel
for the place?'

11:13.063 --> 11:17.285
Uh...I don't know.
Wes, we're the customers, right?

11:17.372 --> 11:19.853
Sure thing, Sonya, but..
The more, the merrier, Mr. Jane.

11:19.940 --> 11:21.681
Whoo!

11:21.768 --> 11:24.771
Just showing Jack and Sonya
here a claim I have for sale.

11:24.858 --> 11:27.730
- Watch and learn.
- Alright.

11:27.817 --> 11:29.558
Ahem, alright.

11:31.342 --> 11:32.909
You knew Rick Loomis,
didn't you?

11:32.996 --> 11:35.346
The, uh, miner
that died in the park?

11:35.433 --> 11:39.046
Yeah. I sold Loomis a claim
when he first got to Hadley.

11:39.133 --> 11:41.657
- Real tragedy. Nice guy.
- Ah.

11:41.744 --> 11:43.964
So, it's the bends
in the river

11:44.051 --> 11:45.139
where you're gonna
find the gold, you see?

11:45.226 --> 11:46.923
- 'Uh-huh.'
- 'Okay.'

11:47.010 --> 11:49.447
[Wes]
'It's heavier, so it falls
into the silt.'

11:49.534 --> 11:51.711
You just gotta
wash the silt away.

11:59.022 --> 12:00.371
What do you see there?

12:02.809 --> 12:04.375
- Jack, gold.
- Oh, my God.

12:04.462 --> 12:06.943
- Oh, my..
- I wonder what it's worth.

12:07.030 --> 12:10.338
Did you know only 10 percent of
the gold in the Sierra Nevada's

12:10.425 --> 12:12.644
was found during
the original gold rush?

12:12.732 --> 12:16.039
Billions of dollars
are out there..

12:16.126 --> 12:17.693
...just waiting
to be discovered.

12:17.780 --> 12:18.912
[chuckling]

12:18.999 --> 12:22.480
- Can I see?
- Um...yeah.

12:22.567 --> 12:24.569
Wow.

12:24.656 --> 12:25.962
- Yeah.
- 'It's cool.'

12:26.049 --> 12:28.138
Yeah. Hey, Wes.

12:29.444 --> 12:30.793
Want to try
just here?

12:32.708 --> 12:35.145
How about we let the new
owners pan over there?

12:36.843 --> 12:38.758
- Well, I'll take it.
- Hey, hey.

12:38.845 --> 12:41.151
- 'Hang on, pal.'
- We-we get first dibs.

12:41.238 --> 12:43.284
Dibs? What are we?
Children?

12:43.371 --> 12:44.894
I'm just kidding.
It's all yours.

12:44.981 --> 12:47.592
Do you-do you have another
claim you can sell me?

12:47.679 --> 12:50.465
Uh..
Heh.

12:50.552 --> 12:53.207
- Yeah, I do have other claims.
- Yeah?

12:53.294 --> 12:55.209
Great spots, but, uh..

12:55.296 --> 12:56.732
...aren't you here on
the police business?

12:56.819 --> 13:00.780
Yeah. So? It doesn't mean
I can't mine for gold.

13:00.867 --> 13:03.957
- Do whatever I want.
- Okay. Sure thing.

13:04.044 --> 13:08.439
- Cool.
- I got another super-hot site.

13:08.526 --> 13:12.748
Black sand and quartz.
All up and down the bed stream.

13:12.835 --> 13:14.794
Black sand and quartz.
That's the good stuff, isn't it?

13:14.881 --> 13:17.318
Yep. This is the site for you.
It's up the creek there.

13:17.405 --> 13:19.537
- About half a mile.
- And where are we here?

13:19.624 --> 13:20.887
- About here.
- Okay.

13:20.974 --> 13:23.454
So, can we go take
a look at it now?

13:23.541 --> 13:26.066
You know, I'm-I'm kinda
jammed today, but, uh..

13:26.153 --> 13:28.459
What do you say I meet you at
the parking lot bright and early

13:28.546 --> 13:30.418
'tomorrow morning?
Say, 8:00 a.m.?'

13:30.505 --> 13:32.550
Tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.
in the parking lot.

13:32.637 --> 13:34.422
- Looking forward to it.
- Good.

13:34.509 --> 13:36.598
Yeah, well,
good luck to you.

13:36.685 --> 13:39.166
Oh, I won't need luck.
I'm feeling the gold.

13:39.253 --> 13:41.777
I feel rich already.
You take it easy.

13:41.864 --> 13:43.170
- Yeah.
- That's the spirit.

13:43.257 --> 13:45.128
- I'll see you later. 8:00 a.m.
- Good.

13:45.215 --> 13:46.390
- Alright.
- Yoo-hoo!

13:50.525 --> 13:52.396
Rick owns a Colt 45.
Where is it?

13:52.483 --> 13:55.095
A gun?
Rick?

13:56.923 --> 13:59.316
What would Rick
need a gun for?

13:59.403 --> 14:01.579
You also told us you were broke,
but you have $5,000.

14:01.666 --> 14:03.146
That's not broke.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.541
That's my money,
and you can't touch it.

14:06.628 --> 14:09.022
We don't plan on touching it.
Where'd you get it?

14:09.109 --> 14:10.327
Waitressing.

14:12.503 --> 14:14.244
$5,000 tucked away.

14:16.420 --> 14:18.596
And you booked a seat
on flight 465 to San Fran

14:18.683 --> 14:20.076
for this morning.

14:20.163 --> 14:22.992
No. I mean...I mean, yeah.

14:24.385 --> 14:26.300
I booked that a week ago.

14:27.431 --> 14:28.737
Before he died.

14:28.824 --> 14:30.347
Exactly. It looks
like a plan.

14:30.434 --> 14:32.654
Some plan.
I didn't go, did I?

14:32.741 --> 14:33.916
Why not?

14:34.003 --> 14:35.613
Because I knew
it'll look bad.

14:35.700 --> 14:38.790
Why were you
planning on going?

14:38.878 --> 14:41.097
'Cause I was
leaving Rick.

14:41.184 --> 14:42.925
I couldn't take it
here anymore.

14:44.666 --> 14:46.668
- Did Rick know that?
- No.

14:46.755 --> 14:49.105
Rick was blind to everything
but the gold.

14:49.192 --> 14:51.586
He's been like that
ever since we got here.

14:51.673 --> 14:53.544
He-he would find
a little nugget

14:53.631 --> 14:56.069
and he would get all excited
and come running in, saying.

14:56.156 --> 14:58.288
"We're rich.
I hit the mother lode."

14:58.375 --> 15:00.160
The first three times,
I believed him

15:00.247 --> 15:02.989
and then after the 20th time,
I couldn't take it anymore.

15:04.816 --> 15:08.995
Look, I loved him. I did.

15:09.082 --> 15:12.085
But I fell in love with
a regular guy with an apartment

15:12.172 --> 15:15.871
and a job and clean clothes,
not some obsessive

15:15.958 --> 15:17.917
scratching in the dirt.

15:19.483 --> 15:22.486
But I need you to know
I'm-I'm not a bad person.

15:24.314 --> 15:26.012
I don't make that
kind of evaluation.

15:29.058 --> 15:31.931
[theme music]

15:40.678 --> 15:42.463
Uh, excuse me, sir.

15:42.550 --> 15:44.769
Do you know which store
is Wes Attwood's?

15:44.856 --> 15:46.119
Yep.

15:48.382 --> 15:51.689
- You wanna tell me?
- Right there.

15:53.169 --> 15:54.518
Thank you.

15:54.605 --> 15:56.912
'Course, it's not
open right now.

15:58.174 --> 16:00.611
Of course.

16:00.698 --> 16:03.049
Do you know how
I can contact him?

16:03.136 --> 16:04.441
Yep.

16:06.313 --> 16:08.097
Uh, you don't wanna get her mad.

16:08.184 --> 16:10.491
She's, uh, stressed
enough already.

16:12.928 --> 16:15.322
- Where have you been?
- In the diner.

16:15.409 --> 16:17.150
Not when I went by there
several hours ago.

16:17.237 --> 16:18.629
Good eggs.

16:18.716 --> 16:20.892
Two loosely scrambled
on toast is the test

16:20.980 --> 16:23.199
and these were just so.

16:23.286 --> 16:25.245
Then, I took a nice walk
in the countryside.

16:25.332 --> 16:27.116
You know, there's no
cell phone range in these hills

16:27.203 --> 16:30.293
which I find
very refreshing.

16:30.380 --> 16:32.600
I am going to go
see Wes Attwood.

16:32.687 --> 16:34.210
Perhaps, you'll join me?

16:34.297 --> 16:36.517
You're really committed to
keeping your temper contained

16:36.604 --> 16:38.562
huh? What's up with that?

16:38.649 --> 16:41.087
You're really committed
to testing my temper, huh?

16:41.174 --> 16:43.393
- What's up with that?
- Idle curiosity.

16:46.179 --> 16:47.528
[Hightower]
'What-what're you doing?'

16:47.615 --> 16:50.096
- I'm hiding from Wes Attwood.
- Why?

16:50.183 --> 16:51.706
Because we're gonna
follow him.

17:00.671 --> 17:03.022
- Okay.
- Okay.

17:03.109 --> 17:04.849
Oop.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.512
- What's he doing?
- He's trying to defraud me.

17:17.688 --> 17:19.603
His shotgun is filled
with gold flakes.

17:19.690 --> 17:24.173
He's salting the claims he sells
to make 'em appear richer.

17:24.260 --> 17:26.523
Hey, Wes! Looks like
we're both a little early.

17:26.610 --> 17:28.438
Whoa, whoa! Easy!

17:28.525 --> 17:30.571
Put the gun down!
Put the shotgun down!

17:30.658 --> 17:33.008
Okay, okay. Chill. Don't-don't
shoot. I'm not resisting.

17:33.095 --> 17:34.270
- Turn around.
- I'm not resisting--

17:34.357 --> 17:36.098
- Turn around.
- Okay, okay.

17:37.708 --> 17:39.797
Look, this is a misundersta..

17:39.884 --> 17:43.540
You-you can't cuff me.
I-I haven't committed a crime.

17:43.627 --> 17:46.108
Try pointing a gun at a police
officer, for starters. Move.

17:46.195 --> 17:48.284
- This is outrageous.
- That's the spirit.

18:02.603 --> 18:06.520
Gold in a shotgun
cartridge. Clever.

18:06.607 --> 18:09.349
Mr. Attwood, let me lay it out
for you, looks to us like

18:09.436 --> 18:11.481
Rick Loomis caught you salting
the gold claims.

18:11.568 --> 18:13.744
He would have
been plenty mad.

18:13.831 --> 18:16.312
You would have had to
kill him to keep him quiet.

18:16.399 --> 18:19.402
He-he-hey, now,
I didn't kill anybody.

18:21.012 --> 18:23.276
Man, I'm a killer
salesman, but..

18:23.363 --> 18:25.060
...you know,
I'm not a killer.

18:25.147 --> 18:26.453
Ask yourself
whether this is

18:26.540 --> 18:28.368
the right moment for humor,
Mr. Attwood.

18:34.243 --> 18:36.724
I am a seller of hope.

18:36.811 --> 18:40.554
I was simply helping folks
visualize the future.

18:41.903 --> 18:44.079
Great marketing
is not a crime.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.386
And I wouldn't murder
anyone to cover it up.

18:46.473 --> 18:50.041
We'll see, we can hold you
on the fraud charges

18:50.129 --> 18:51.869
and see about
the murder as we go.

18:51.956 --> 18:53.523
Oh, come on.

18:53.610 --> 18:56.439
I can have a lawyer here
in half an hour. Be reasonable.

18:56.526 --> 19:00.313
There's plenty of people
that could have killed that guy.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.141
Fraud alone can
get you ten years

19:02.228 --> 19:04.969
'depending on the judge.'

19:05.056 --> 19:06.667
Have you even checked
into the sneak thief

19:06.754 --> 19:08.669
that's been targeting miners.

19:08.756 --> 19:11.019
'Stealing their equipment?'

19:11.106 --> 19:12.760
Loomis got hit
ten days ago.

19:12.847 --> 19:16.198
Bastard cleaned him out. That's
who killed him, I promise you.

19:16.285 --> 19:17.895
If that's true, I wonder
why Sheriff Hughes

19:17.982 --> 19:19.593
didn't tell us about it.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.334
That's why I hate these
small town investigations.

19:21.421 --> 19:22.900
You never know if the guys
have done the math.

19:22.987 --> 19:26.382
I'm gonna follow up
with Hughes.Ow.

19:26.469 --> 19:28.471
- You good?
- Screw it. You go.

19:28.558 --> 19:30.821
Yeah.

19:30.908 --> 19:34.085
Why rob Loomis and then
kill him ten days later?

19:34.173 --> 19:36.784
Maybe, Loomis found out who
it was that stole from him

19:36.871 --> 19:38.960
and confronted him.

19:39.047 --> 19:41.005
Yeah. That must be
what happened.

19:45.793 --> 19:47.534
Something you care to share?

19:47.621 --> 19:50.928
No. Sorry, just
a funny thought, is all.

19:52.930 --> 19:55.672
Can I go now,
or are you gonna charge me?

19:55.759 --> 19:58.545
I'll let you know.

19:58.632 --> 20:00.547
[Hightower]
'Alright. That's odd.'

20:00.634 --> 20:02.766
Okay, well, charge
Wes Attwood with fraud

20:02.853 --> 20:04.203
if he can post bail,
let him go

20:04.290 --> 20:07.336
and put a name
to this local thief.

20:07.423 --> 20:08.729
Alright. Okay.

20:08.816 --> 20:10.731
So, Sheriff Hughes
confirms that there has been

20:10.818 --> 20:12.341
a string of
equipment thefts.

20:12.428 --> 20:16.389
But he says that Rick Loomis
never filed a police report.

20:16.476 --> 20:19.653
Hmm. Why not, we wonder.
Let's go talk sluice pumps.

20:22.656 --> 20:25.267
- So, you play bad cop.
- I'll be me, thank you.

20:25.354 --> 20:27.400
Alright. Exactly
what I said.

20:27.487 --> 20:28.401
Funny.

20:29.706 --> 20:31.273
So funny.

20:36.583 --> 20:39.760
- I hit a big one.
- Wow. They're huge.

20:39.847 --> 20:42.023
- Are You cashing in?
- Hell, no!

20:42.110 --> 20:43.894
Just when I hit
good dirt? Nah.

20:43.981 --> 20:46.201
I'm buying a better pump
and foot valves.

20:46.288 --> 20:47.811
Hey, Mr. Jane.
How ya doin'?

20:47.898 --> 20:49.117
- Good. How are you?
- Good.

20:49.204 --> 20:51.250
Oh, this is, uh,
Special Agent Hightower.

20:51.337 --> 20:53.991
We believe Rick Loomis bought
some, uh, new mining equipment

20:54.078 --> 20:56.080
from you after his old
equipment had been stolen.

20:56.167 --> 20:59.301
Yes, he did. He was in here,
I'd say, about nine days ago.

20:59.388 --> 21:01.390
- What did he buy?
- Whole bunch of stuff.

21:01.477 --> 21:05.002
- He spent over 10 grand.
- Maybe we could see an invoice?

21:05.089 --> 21:07.440
Yeah. Give me a second.
I'll pull it up.

21:07.527 --> 21:12.183
Um, would you mind terribly
if I-if I held one of your, uh

21:12.271 --> 21:13.881
your nuggets in my hand?

21:13.968 --> 21:17.450
Mm..
Sure, I guess.

21:17.537 --> 21:18.842
[Hightower]
'Thank you.'

21:18.929 --> 21:21.932
[Patrick]
'Thanks.'

21:22.019 --> 21:26.807
The g-force rock crusher
anda series 54 pulverizer?

21:26.894 --> 21:29.549
Man, I wish I had
one of those.

21:29.636 --> 21:31.725
That's the-that's the best
for hard rock mining.

21:31.812 --> 21:33.727
Yep. That's some good
gear for sure.

21:33.814 --> 21:35.337
Hard rock mining.
Is that in the creek?

21:35.424 --> 21:37.078
No, no. Creek panning's a whole
other thing.

21:37.165 --> 21:39.820
Hard rock, it's like it sounds,
uh, dry mining up in the hills.

21:39.907 --> 21:41.909
Did he mention to you
that his mining equipment

21:41.996 --> 21:43.606
had been stolen?

21:43.693 --> 21:46.000
He didn't. He said that he got
sick and tired of panning.

21:46.087 --> 21:48.176
Wanted to try something new.
Seemed a little bit

21:48.263 --> 21:50.439
like a Hail Mary desperation
kind of play to me.

21:50.526 --> 21:52.223
But hey, chasing his dream,
you know?

21:52.311 --> 21:54.835
He never did
have any patience.

21:54.922 --> 21:57.577
You know, God rest his soul.

21:57.664 --> 21:59.492
Right. Thank you.

22:01.494 --> 22:02.756
Hey!

22:06.107 --> 22:09.023
You got me. Worth a try.

22:09.110 --> 22:10.198
[cell phone rings]

22:10.285 --> 22:12.592
Sorry, ma'am.
Hello?

22:12.679 --> 22:15.508
Ma'am, Rigsby.
So we may have found our thief.

22:15.595 --> 22:17.684
'Scott Monroe. He's a townie
with a long rap sheet.'

22:17.771 --> 22:20.600
'Assault with a deadly weapon,
B and E and wait for it'

22:20.687 --> 22:22.471
stealing mining equipment.

22:22.558 --> 22:24.343
'Got out of prison
six months ago.'

22:24.430 --> 22:26.823
Good work. Scott Monroe.
You got an address?

22:26.910 --> 22:28.738
Yeah, I'm gonna send it to you..

22:30.087 --> 22:31.915
'Rigsby? An address?'

22:32.002 --> 22:34.744
Uh, y-yes, ma'am.
Your...kids are here?

22:36.398 --> 22:37.486
What?

22:40.359 --> 22:43.971
Ma'am. Your, uh, husband
had to go somewhere, I guess.

22:44.058 --> 22:48.889
'He left Mimi and Will
with Jean at the front desk.'

22:48.976 --> 22:51.326
Damn. Damn. Damn.

22:53.807 --> 22:56.418
Lisbon here.
Listen, don't worry.

22:56.505 --> 22:58.289
We can look after them
until you get back.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.335
Lisbon, thank you.

23:00.422 --> 23:03.947
'I appreciate it, truly.
I, um..'

23:06.123 --> 23:07.298
Thank you.

23:08.778 --> 23:10.476
May I have a word
with Mimi, please?

23:10.563 --> 23:12.347
Alright.
It's your mom.

23:14.523 --> 23:15.437
Hi, mommy.

23:17.874 --> 23:21.312
- Hi, baby. You okay?
- 'Uh-huh.'

23:21.400 --> 23:23.097
'Look, I'm gonna be back
in a few hours'

23:23.184 --> 23:25.186
but I want you to, uh,
be a good girl

23:25.273 --> 23:27.275
and I want you to listen
to what Ms. Lisbon says

23:27.362 --> 23:29.451
and I want you to look after
your brother, okay?

23:29.538 --> 23:30.496
Okay.

23:30.583 --> 23:31.758
Mimi, I love you.

23:33.716 --> 23:35.544
- Bye.
- Bye.

23:40.941 --> 23:43.247
So, uh..

23:43.334 --> 23:44.597
Who's Scott Monroe?

23:47.904 --> 23:50.037
Local mining equipment thief.

23:50.124 --> 23:52.561
Excellent.
Let's go talk to him, shall we?

23:52.648 --> 23:54.302
Thanks for
not asking questions.

23:54.389 --> 23:57.740
Oh, no need to ask questions
when you know all the answers.

23:57.827 --> 23:58.872
[sighs]

23:59.612 --> 24:00.700
So.

24:02.136 --> 24:03.616
- Cookies?
- Okay.

24:08.882 --> 24:10.013
[Mimi]
'Are you disabled?'

24:10.100 --> 24:12.015
No. No, I'm injured.

24:12.102 --> 24:15.541
Not that disabled is bad,
but I'm not. I'm injured.

24:15.628 --> 24:17.325
You walk like disabled.

24:20.110 --> 24:22.461
[instrumental music]

24:24.811 --> 24:25.725
[car door slams]

24:27.640 --> 24:30.164
So no questions,
but, uh..

24:31.426 --> 24:33.123
...we can talk if you want.

24:33.210 --> 24:35.343
Talk about what?

24:35.430 --> 24:38.651
- I'll take that as a no.
- Yes. No.

24:38.738 --> 24:41.480
Scott? Scott Monroe?

24:42.959 --> 24:45.135
- Scott Monroe?
- Uh, uh.

24:48.878 --> 24:50.053
CBI.

25:00.194 --> 25:01.935
Oh hell.

25:02.022 --> 25:05.460
Is it...Scott Monroe?

25:05.547 --> 25:10.160
No. Wes Attwood.
Gold claims dealer.

25:10.247 --> 25:11.597
That's odd.

25:12.467 --> 25:13.642
Odd?

25:13.729 --> 25:16.384
Well, it's sad too,
but I'm..

25:16.471 --> 25:18.517
I'm just saying it's odd

25:18.604 --> 25:20.431
that it's not Scott Monroe.

25:25.915 --> 25:27.090
Where's Mimi and Will?

25:27.177 --> 25:29.092
Tearing up paper in my office.

25:29.179 --> 25:31.530
- What's going on with Monroe?
- Well, we've got a bolo out.

25:31.617 --> 25:33.357
And Sheriff Hughes
is putting up roadblocks.

25:33.444 --> 25:34.968
Hadley's pretty much
on lockdown.

25:35.055 --> 25:36.796
Why would Monroe kill Attwood?

25:36.883 --> 25:38.624
Well, maybe he was conducting
an investigation of his own.

25:38.711 --> 25:41.235
You know, trying to figure out
if Monroe killed Loomis.

25:41.322 --> 25:43.629
Found out the hard way.

25:43.716 --> 25:45.500
Rigsby.

25:45.587 --> 25:48.416
No, don't move in. You'll scare
him off. We're leaving now.

25:48.503 --> 25:50.636
Monroe's been spotted in a local
bar that his cousin works at.

25:50.723 --> 25:52.159
Go. Both of you.

25:53.987 --> 25:55.162
[cell phone rings]

25:57.947 --> 25:59.253
Hey, boss.

25:59.340 --> 26:01.168
No, they're fine.

26:01.255 --> 26:02.604
Y-yeah.
Uh-huh.

26:05.172 --> 26:07.653
Uh-huh.
Alright.

26:07.740 --> 26:11.178
Hey, hold on a second.
Whoa! Look at this!

26:11.265 --> 26:13.354
Excellent work, guys.

26:13.441 --> 26:15.791
Now we are gonna take this paper

26:15.878 --> 26:19.447
and put it in these bags.
But first, say hi to mommy.

26:19.534 --> 26:21.405
- Hi, mom.
- Hi, mom.

26:21.492 --> 26:23.320
Hey, mommy, guess what?

26:23.407 --> 26:24.931
We're tearing up paper.

26:25.018 --> 26:27.194
Tearing up paper?

26:27.281 --> 26:28.804
[sighs]
Okay.

26:28.891 --> 26:33.069
Alright. Well Mimi,
eat all your snack, okay?

26:33.156 --> 26:35.768
Alright. I love you.

26:35.855 --> 26:38.205
Give the phone back to, um,
Agent Lisbon for me.

26:38.292 --> 26:39.859
- 'Okay.'
- Okay.

26:41.382 --> 26:44.385
Hey. You're sending Rigsby
and Van Pelt?

26:44.472 --> 26:47.910
Okay, great.
Keep me apprised on Monroe.

26:47.997 --> 26:49.999
Alright. Thanks.
Bye.

26:51.044 --> 26:52.915
Chamomile tea?

26:53.002 --> 26:56.745
Excellent for repressed anger.

26:56.832 --> 26:58.921
- I'm not angry.
- Sure, you are.

26:59.008 --> 27:01.445
Letting it out would be helpful,
I guarantee it.

27:01.532 --> 27:04.405
Shout, scream, hit something.
Preferably not me.

27:04.492 --> 27:05.928
It'll do you wonders.

27:06.015 --> 27:08.539
You only think you know
all the answers, Patrick.

27:08.627 --> 27:09.889
You don't.

27:12.369 --> 27:13.980
You're getting a divorce.

27:14.067 --> 27:15.590
And now,
your husband is acting out.

27:15.677 --> 27:18.375
He just showed up
and left the kids with you.

27:20.726 --> 27:22.379
How'd you know I was
getting a divorce?

27:22.466 --> 27:24.860
Your posture,
the look in your eyes.

27:24.947 --> 27:26.819
Your wedding ring, it's gone.

27:28.864 --> 27:31.519
You've been having trouble
for years.

27:31.606 --> 27:34.261
Trying to make it work
for the kids.

27:34.348 --> 27:37.046
Plus, uh,
everyone in the office knows.

27:37.133 --> 27:39.614
Water cooler talk. Depends on
who you're speaking with.

27:39.701 --> 27:41.268
You cheated on him
or he cheated on you

27:41.355 --> 27:42.443
and you've just had enough, so--

27:42.530 --> 27:45.446
- Okay.
- Okay.

27:45.533 --> 27:48.579
Let's keep the focus
on the business at hand, okay?

27:50.538 --> 27:52.496
Why would Monroe first kill
Loomis and then Attwood?

27:52.583 --> 27:54.716
What-what's the connection?

27:54.803 --> 27:57.327
Mmm. My question is this.

27:57.414 --> 27:59.852
Why did the killer shoot Loomis
and then drive the body

27:59.939 --> 28:02.332
all the way to the creek?

28:02.419 --> 28:06.728
Well, not to hide the body.
He left it in plain sight. So..

28:06.815 --> 28:08.774
He didn't want the body found
at the kill site.

28:08.861 --> 28:10.732
Exactly. Why not?

28:10.819 --> 28:15.606
[sighs]
Van Pelt and Rigsby
are gonna pick up Scott Monroe.

28:15.694 --> 28:16.869
We'll ask him.

28:16.956 --> 28:18.697
[indistinct conversation]

28:22.048 --> 28:23.527
Club soda, please.

28:28.271 --> 28:30.578
How about something
a little stronger?

28:30.665 --> 28:31.840
I'm buying.

28:31.927 --> 28:34.060
Oh, hey.
Scott, right?

28:34.147 --> 28:35.670
Scott Monroe?

28:35.757 --> 28:37.063
Yeah.

28:37.150 --> 28:40.893
That's funny, 'cause
I've been looking for you.

28:40.980 --> 28:42.546
Later, bitch.

28:42.633 --> 28:43.809
[male #2]
'What the hell?'

28:43.896 --> 28:45.854
What? She's a cop.

28:46.986 --> 28:48.248
Yeah. Me, too.

28:48.335 --> 28:50.729
Up against the wall.

28:50.816 --> 28:52.687
Put your hands behind your back.

28:52.774 --> 28:54.602
[handcuffs click]

28:54.689 --> 28:55.821
[phone ringing]

28:55.908 --> 28:57.953
- Teresa.
- Yes, Mimi.

28:58.040 --> 28:59.781
I'm done with
my math homework.

28:59.868 --> 29:02.349
Good work.
Did you check it?

29:02.436 --> 29:03.698
No.

29:03.785 --> 29:05.526
- Check it please.
- Okay.

29:05.613 --> 29:07.267
After homework, can we watch TV?

29:07.354 --> 29:10.749
- Nope.
- 'Hey, we got Monroe.'

29:10.836 --> 29:13.186
You two stay here,
after you finish your homework

29:13.273 --> 29:15.275
you can have another snack.
They're on my desk.

29:15.362 --> 29:16.842
Need some help?

29:16.929 --> 29:18.800
And then TV?

29:18.887 --> 29:21.672
And then Agent Rigsby
will tell you a story.

29:26.112 --> 29:27.374
Mr. Monroe,
tell us what happened

29:27.461 --> 29:28.549
with Loomis and Attwood.

29:28.636 --> 29:30.638
I have no idea,
except they're dead.

29:30.725 --> 29:32.466
Yeah, Attwood was dead
on the floor of your trailer.

29:32.553 --> 29:33.772
Man, this is a frame-up.

29:33.859 --> 29:35.121
Maybe, I should be talking
to my lawyer.

29:35.208 --> 29:37.819
That's your right, of course.

29:37.906 --> 29:40.169
But this doesn't
need to be adversarial.

29:40.256 --> 29:42.345
Just clear a few things up
for us.

29:42.432 --> 29:43.825
What do you wanna know?

29:43.912 --> 29:46.175
We're told
you're the top thief in Hadley.

29:46.262 --> 29:48.612
You specialize
in gold mining equipment.

29:48.699 --> 29:50.658
We hear you're the best at it.

29:50.745 --> 29:53.617
It's good to be the best
at something. Right, Scott?

29:53.704 --> 29:55.968
That stuff holds up
it's resale value real well.

29:56.055 --> 29:58.013
And you killed Attwood because
he found out you killed Loomis.

29:58.100 --> 29:59.058
You killed Loomis
because he found out

29:59.145 --> 30:00.363
you stole his equipment.

30:00.450 --> 30:02.713
Hey. You know who stole
Loomis' equipment?

30:02.801 --> 30:07.022
His own kid, Jeff. Yeah.
I'm blowing your mind, right?

30:07.109 --> 30:09.329
The kid came to me last week
to unload the stuff.

30:09.416 --> 30:11.548
I bought the whole lot
for a hundred bucks.

30:11.635 --> 30:13.246
Cold, little bastard.

30:13.333 --> 30:14.682
Call Hightower.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.775
Your father's mining equipment
was recently stolen.

30:20.862 --> 30:22.081
Do you know anything
about that?

30:22.168 --> 30:23.996
No.

30:24.083 --> 30:26.694
So it wasn't you, who stole
your father's equipment?

30:26.781 --> 30:28.261
No. It's not true.

30:28.348 --> 30:30.829
Come on, Jeff.
You were mad at him. We get it.

30:30.916 --> 30:32.656
I wasn't mad at him.

30:32.743 --> 30:34.833
He cleaned out your college fund
and you weren't mad at him?

30:34.920 --> 30:37.270
That's a...little odd, Jeff.

30:37.357 --> 30:39.576
Talk to us, Jeff.
Help us make this right.

30:44.973 --> 30:47.454
[sighs]
My grandparents
gave me that money.

30:47.541 --> 30:49.325
If he had just asked me

30:49.412 --> 30:51.501
I would have said sure.
But he tried to hide it from me.

30:51.588 --> 30:55.070
So you got even by stealing
his panning equipment?

30:55.157 --> 30:56.376
Did your father find out?

30:56.463 --> 30:57.812
Oh, he knew
it was Jeff all along.

30:57.899 --> 31:01.250
That's why
he didn't call the police.

31:01.337 --> 31:03.731
Did you two
get into a fight?

31:03.818 --> 31:05.472
Jeff, what happened?

31:07.343 --> 31:08.562
What happened?

31:11.739 --> 31:15.177
He wasn't even mad,
he said he was sorry

31:15.264 --> 31:17.005
about the college money,
about everything.

31:17.092 --> 31:20.226
'He promised
to make it up to me.'

31:20.313 --> 31:23.055
I didn't wanna listen to him,
so I walked out.

31:23.142 --> 31:25.492
And that was the last time
we ever spoke.

31:25.579 --> 31:28.103
Well, that's too bad.

31:28.190 --> 31:32.194
But I imagine owning a gold mine
will ease the guilt.

31:32.281 --> 31:34.762
Do you have a map of the area?

31:34.849 --> 31:35.806
Huh?

31:35.894 --> 31:37.678
A map.

31:37.765 --> 31:40.855
I think, the huh,
was for the gold mine part.

31:40.942 --> 31:42.944
Ah. Yes.

31:43.031 --> 31:46.774
Uh, Jeff, what did your dad
stop doing recently?

31:49.124 --> 31:50.952
Washing himself?

31:51.039 --> 31:53.302
No. Something else.
Uh..

31:53.389 --> 31:56.001
What did your dad
stop saying recently?

31:56.088 --> 31:58.438
He stopped saying..

31:58.525 --> 32:00.657
...that he found a gold mine.

32:00.744 --> 32:05.924
Yes. Which could only mean
that he found a gold mine.

32:06.011 --> 32:07.577
- 'Really?'
- 'Really.'

32:07.664 --> 32:10.145
And Jeff is gonna
tell us where it is.

32:10.232 --> 32:11.799
I am? How?

32:14.933 --> 32:16.369
Hey, guys. Can I help you?

32:16.456 --> 32:18.806
Yes, uh, we need to look
at a large-scale map

32:18.893 --> 32:20.112
of the hill country.

32:20.199 --> 32:21.200
Got one right there
on the table.

32:21.287 --> 32:22.897
Okay. Thank you.

32:26.727 --> 32:28.294
Hmm.

32:28.381 --> 32:30.513
Your father found gold, Jeff.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.559
He knew you and Cheryl
wouldn't believe him.

32:32.646 --> 32:34.430
He'd disappointed you
so many times before

32:34.517 --> 32:37.172
so he wouldn't tell anyone,
not a soul.

32:37.259 --> 32:40.697
Not until he had that real gold
to put in your hand.

32:40.784 --> 32:43.918
'He told you nothing.
He wanted to.'

32:44.005 --> 32:46.747
Badly.
And subconsciously, he did.

32:46.834 --> 32:50.055
Subconsciously, he told you
exactly where that gold is.

32:50.142 --> 32:52.971
- So where is it?
- Yeah, where is it?

32:54.494 --> 32:56.670
Honestly, I don't have any idea.

32:56.757 --> 32:58.672
You and your father
were close, weren't you?

32:58.759 --> 33:00.804
You loved one another?

33:00.891 --> 33:02.241
- Yes.
- Yes.

33:02.328 --> 33:05.984
You had a connection.

33:06.071 --> 33:08.595
You know a lot more
than you think you know.

33:11.206 --> 33:13.252
Let's take a look,
shall we?

33:13.339 --> 33:15.428
Give me your hand.

33:16.733 --> 33:18.909
This is for your father.
Trust me.

33:18.997 --> 33:21.825
I need a physical connection
to get a good reading, please.

33:21.912 --> 33:25.307
Thank you. Now we're working
together. That's nice.

33:25.394 --> 33:28.049
Now, just relax.

33:28.136 --> 33:30.312
- Relax.
- Okay.

33:30.399 --> 33:33.098
What I'm doing is scanning
his unconscious

33:33.185 --> 33:35.622
measuring his affinity.

33:35.709 --> 33:37.667
Narrow it down.

33:39.147 --> 33:41.019
You narrow it down..

33:43.108 --> 33:45.458
...to a more specific area.

33:55.163 --> 33:57.905
Uh-huh.
Interesting.

33:59.211 --> 34:01.343
- What is?
- Jane?

34:04.433 --> 34:06.870
Yes.

34:06.957 --> 34:08.829
Nope.

34:08.916 --> 34:11.310
Never mind. Didn't work.

34:12.615 --> 34:16.576
You said,
"Uh-huh. Interesting."

34:16.663 --> 34:21.494
Yes, I did. Uh, I thought I was
getting a location, but, uh..

34:21.581 --> 34:24.236
I was wrong.

34:24.323 --> 34:26.064
It's not an exact science,
what I do.

34:26.151 --> 34:27.630
No kidding.

34:27.717 --> 34:30.851
Well, uh, I need to go
and get me some eggs.

34:30.938 --> 34:33.201
- But what about the gold mine?
- Disappointing, I know.

34:33.288 --> 34:35.247
But, you seem like
a smart, young man.

34:35.334 --> 34:37.075
I-I think, you'll do fine.

34:40.687 --> 34:41.644
Jane!

34:43.733 --> 34:44.691
Jane!

34:48.086 --> 34:50.131
Hey.

34:50.218 --> 34:52.742
Jane! Jane!

34:54.831 --> 34:57.182
[instrumental music]

35:04.450 --> 35:06.278
[birds chirping]

35:13.807 --> 35:16.070
[instrumental music]

35:43.750 --> 35:45.186
[music continues]

36:08.209 --> 36:09.254
[leaves rustling]

36:10.820 --> 36:12.692
[Patrick]
'Hi, Dean.'

36:12.779 --> 36:15.956
Mr. Jane, I'm impressed.

36:16.043 --> 36:17.653
You found it.

36:17.740 --> 36:20.917
You really did scan that kid's
unconscious, or whatever.

36:21.004 --> 36:22.919
No, that'd be magic.

36:23.006 --> 36:24.660
So, then, how?

36:24.747 --> 36:27.402
Well, I watched you watch
the boy's hand on the map

36:27.489 --> 36:29.099
and got a general direction
and then I waited

36:29.187 --> 36:31.319
for your truck to go by
and I followed you here.

36:31.406 --> 36:33.930
It was you that led me
to the gold.

36:34.017 --> 36:35.932
Don't feel bad.
I assure you

36:36.019 --> 36:37.891
better men than you
have been taken.

36:40.415 --> 36:42.200
How'd you know it was me?

36:42.287 --> 36:44.724
Rick Loomis
preferred smooth jazz.

36:44.811 --> 36:46.682
- You like the heavy metal.
- So?

36:46.769 --> 36:50.556
So your disdain for mellow
saxophone solos

36:50.643 --> 36:52.993
has cost you dearly.

36:53.080 --> 36:55.256
Did Rick Loomis tell you
he'd found a seam

36:55.343 --> 36:58.172
or did you just follow him
on the off chance?

36:58.259 --> 37:00.435
Look, Mr. Jane,
with all due respect

37:00.522 --> 37:03.482
my family has been
up here in Hadley, mining

37:03.569 --> 37:06.006
since the first gold rush.

37:06.093 --> 37:11.054
[Dean]
That gold belongs to me.
To my family.

37:11.141 --> 37:13.187
Not to some newbie
like Loomis.

37:13.927 --> 37:15.798
[gunshot]

37:21.761 --> 37:23.632
[heavy metal music]

37:27.462 --> 37:31.118
Poor Wes Attwood. He figured out
the killer was you, didn't he?

37:31.205 --> 37:33.425
Tried to blackmail you,
get a cut of that gold.

37:33.512 --> 37:35.992
Yeah, you believe the nerve
of that guy?

37:36.079 --> 37:37.037
Greedy bastard.

37:37.124 --> 37:38.473
[chuckles]

37:38.560 --> 37:40.997
You do hear the irony
there, right?

37:41.084 --> 37:45.437
Yeah, when I heard you cops
were lookin' for Scott Monroe

37:45.524 --> 37:47.482
that made it easy.

37:47.569 --> 37:50.746
I make it look like
Monroe killed Attwood

37:50.833 --> 37:52.705
and I'm off the hook
for all of it.

37:52.792 --> 37:53.880
Splendid plan.

37:56.448 --> 37:57.927
You know, the only thing
standing between me

37:58.014 --> 38:01.627
and my gold now,
Mr. Jane...is you.

38:01.714 --> 38:03.933
Any time, Madeleine.

38:04.020 --> 38:05.370
Drop it, Puttock!

38:05.457 --> 38:07.981
No, screw that!
You drop yours.

38:08.068 --> 38:09.722
Drop it!

38:09.809 --> 38:10.897
[gasping]

38:11.724 --> 38:12.638
[gunshot]

38:13.813 --> 38:16.729
[groans]

38:16.816 --> 38:18.687
Son of a bitch.

38:18.774 --> 38:19.775
Seriously?

38:19.862 --> 38:21.951
[gunshots]

38:22.996 --> 38:24.345
[Dean groans]

38:26.956 --> 38:28.871
[gunshots]

38:38.533 --> 38:40.013
Is he dead?

38:51.198 --> 38:52.155
Yeah.

38:56.986 --> 38:58.727
You know, I should applaud
your bravery

38:58.814 --> 39:02.427
but I gotta say,
practically speaking..

39:02.514 --> 39:05.386
What were you thinking?
You could have killed me.

39:05.473 --> 39:10.348
I'm sorry. I got mad. I didn't
know what I was thinking.

39:10.435 --> 39:12.524
That was some good shooting,
though. That..

39:12.611 --> 39:16.005
Leg shot that took him down
was v-very precise.

39:16.092 --> 39:17.833
[exhales deeply]

39:17.920 --> 39:20.009
I was aiming for his head.

39:20.096 --> 39:21.533
Oh, fantastic.

39:31.978 --> 39:34.023
- Hey. Hey, Jeff.
- Hey.

39:34.110 --> 39:35.634
I hear your mom's
flying in.

39:35.721 --> 39:38.550
Yeah, from Fresno. I'm picking
her up in the morning.

39:38.637 --> 39:40.247
Kind of nervous about it.
It's been a while.

39:40.334 --> 39:43.424
Buy her some flowers.
Moms like flowers.

39:43.511 --> 39:45.600
And you can afford
a good bunch.

39:45.687 --> 39:48.516
We had that sent over from
the Bureau of Land Management.

39:48.603 --> 39:51.693
You father was in the process
of filing a mineral rights claim

39:51.780 --> 39:53.303
to the area where
he struck gold.

39:53.391 --> 39:56.524
He named you and Cheryl
as co-owners.

39:56.611 --> 39:58.396
You own half a gold mine.

40:00.659 --> 40:03.226
Wow, I..

40:03.313 --> 40:05.359
Your father came through
in the end.

40:07.927 --> 40:11.060
- Thanks for, uh, you know.
- You're welcome.

40:11.147 --> 40:14.324
Hey, will you, um,
thank Mr. Jane for me?

40:14.412 --> 40:17.545
Will do. Will do.
Good luck to you, Jeff.

40:17.632 --> 40:19.112
Thanks.

40:23.464 --> 40:25.292
[knock on door]

40:32.473 --> 40:34.475
[sighs]
I hope they weren't
too much trouble.

40:34.562 --> 40:38.653
Not at all. I had three
nearly feral brothers.

40:38.740 --> 40:40.612
Your kids are sweethearts.

40:48.794 --> 40:50.970
[clears throat]
Thank you.

40:51.057 --> 40:53.799
Hey, not a problem.

40:58.368 --> 41:00.109
Let me get 'em
out of your hair.

41:04.113 --> 41:06.899
Hello. Hello.

41:06.986 --> 41:08.683
'Get up. Get up.'

41:08.770 --> 41:11.730
[giggling]
Come on.

41:11.817 --> 41:13.079
Give me some sugar.

41:13.166 --> 41:14.646
Give me some sugar.

41:14.733 --> 41:16.212
Thank you.

41:18.040 --> 41:19.738
Hey.

41:19.825 --> 41:21.653
Hey.

41:21.740 --> 41:23.916
It was okay, then?

41:24.003 --> 41:25.613
Case closed.

41:27.572 --> 41:29.443
What was it like?

41:29.530 --> 41:30.662
It?

41:31.576 --> 41:34.274
You know.

41:34.361 --> 41:35.971
Oh.

41:36.058 --> 41:37.886
You mean going out
with another woman?

41:37.973 --> 41:39.366
Yeah. No.

41:39.453 --> 41:41.020
Uh, come on.
You know what I mean.

41:41.107 --> 41:43.239
It was great.

41:43.326 --> 41:46.416
It's fun, intense,
um, challenging.

41:46.504 --> 41:48.897
She's super dynamic.

41:48.984 --> 41:51.900
Yeah. I think we had
a great connection.

41:51.987 --> 41:53.075
That's great.

41:53.162 --> 41:54.424
Mm-hmm.

41:54.512 --> 41:57.036
What, you a little jealous?

41:57.123 --> 41:58.864
[thuds]

42:08.221 --> 42:09.614
[theme music]
