00:02.041 --> 00:04.567
- [Voiceover] Previously
on Children's Hospital.

00:04.567 --> 00:05.679
- Hey Robin.

00:05.679 --> 00:06.856
- Hey.

00:06.856 --> 00:09.100
- How's the house hunting going?

00:09.100 --> 00:12.285
- Well, the prices are right finally, but,

00:12.285 --> 00:14.528
we're gonna have trouble
selling our current house

00:14.528 --> 00:15.548
in this market.

00:15.548 --> 00:17.589
- Mm hmm, yeah.

00:17.589 --> 00:20.541
And loans aren't so easy
to get anymore either.

00:20.541 --> 00:21.797
I just wish someone would admit

00:21.797 --> 00:23.226
that we're going through a recession.

00:23.226 --> 00:24.898
- Tell me about it.

00:24.898 --> 00:28.099
I never really understood
any of that stuff anyway.

00:28.099 --> 00:32.456
- (laughing) Who does?

00:32.456 --> 00:34.286
- (laughs)

00:34.286 --> 00:36.460
- Oh.

00:36.460 --> 00:38.221
(stamp punches)

00:44.241 --> 00:45.669
- Come back to the police force.

00:45.669 --> 00:48.158
I need my partner back.

00:48.158 --> 00:50.438
- I wish I could, but I can't.

00:50.438 --> 00:54.987
Not after the tragic events
of September 11, 2001.

00:54.987 --> 00:56.785
- And there you go.

00:56.785 --> 00:58.505
Looks pretty easy huh?

00:58.505 --> 01:01.667
Well try it with a few cocktails in ya.

01:01.667 --> 01:06.157
(laughs) Oh!

01:06.157 --> 01:07.858
- (exhales) Calling it.

01:07.858 --> 01:10.754
Time of death 1:59pm.

01:10.754 --> 01:13.220
Looks like we lost another one, huh?

01:13.220 --> 01:14.964
(slams table)

01:14.964 --> 01:16.795
Guess it takes more than the
healing power of laughter

01:16.795 --> 01:18.833
to perform a successful operation.

01:18.833 --> 01:21.321
- Yeah, sometimes it takes
actual medical procedure.

01:21.321 --> 01:24.911
- Sometimes, sometimes.

01:24.911 --> 01:27.679
- What happened to you Dr. Downs?

01:32.089 --> 01:36.488
(doo wop music)

01:45.698 --> 01:50.698
(doo wop music)

01:52.415 --> 01:56.717
(ominous music)

01:56.717 --> 01:57.640
- Hey!

01:57.640 --> 01:58.757
What are you, a savage?

01:58.757 --> 02:00.954
Shut the door!

02:00.954 --> 02:01.687
- Blake?

02:01.687 --> 02:02.764
Blake!

02:02.764 --> 02:03.488
- Yeah?

02:03.488 --> 02:05.356
- I want you to take a
look at the girl in 319,

02:05.356 --> 02:06.459
and I don't want to tell you why,

02:06.459 --> 02:08.774
because you always laugh and
I think it's inappropriate.

02:08.774 --> 02:11.025
- Yeah, I don't know what
you're talking about.

02:11.025 --> 02:12.508
- She's covered in bruises.

02:12.508 --> 02:14.467
Afraid of her father, claimed
she fell down the stairs?

02:14.467 --> 02:16.219
- Yeah, just say it, I
promise I won't laugh.

02:16.219 --> 02:18.054
- Okay.

02:18.054 --> 02:22.019
I suspect, child abuse.

02:25.269 --> 02:26.505
- (snickers quietly)

02:26.505 --> 02:27.442
- Blake!

02:27.442 --> 02:30.137
319 get over there right a--

02:30.137 --> 02:31.895
(crutches fall)

02:31.895 --> 02:33.362
- You know what tomorrow is?

02:33.362 --> 02:35.030
- The anniversary of 9/11 right?

02:35.030 --> 02:36.585
- So what does that make today?

02:36.585 --> 02:37.653
- 9/11 eve.

02:37.653 --> 02:38.567
- Bingo.

02:38.567 --> 02:40.156
Doing anything special?

02:40.156 --> 02:41.543
- Probably just get a pinata.

02:41.543 --> 02:42.595
Throw some ribs on the grill.

02:42.595 --> 02:43.547
- Sure sure.

02:43.547 --> 02:44.523
- How about yourself?

02:44.523 --> 02:46.936
- The usual, make my tobacco bread.

02:46.936 --> 02:48.525
Rob Schneider film fest.

02:48.525 --> 02:50.065
- Rob Schneider, send me an evite will ya?

02:50.065 --> 02:51.205
- You got it.
- [Blake] Hey.

02:51.205 --> 02:52.498
- Can you rewrite this again, okay?

02:52.498 --> 02:53.540
I can't read your writing.

02:53.540 --> 02:55.856
- A simple please would be nice.

02:59.438 --> 03:04.438
- (boy urinating)

03:05.071 --> 03:06.441
(exhales)

03:10.291 --> 03:11.831
(exhales)

03:13.071 --> 03:18.071
(angelic music)

03:24.080 --> 03:29.080
(muted yelling)

03:43.698 --> 03:45.567
(girl laughing)

03:45.567 --> 03:46.625
- [Intercom] Attention staff.

03:46.625 --> 03:48.171
The white zone is for immediate loading

03:48.171 --> 03:50.402
and unloading of passengers only.

03:50.402 --> 03:53.873
There is no stopping in the red zone.

03:58.636 --> 04:00.145
- What the balls is this?

04:00.145 --> 04:02.300
- That's Nate Schachter.

04:02.300 --> 04:04.997
Best damn leukemia doctor
in all of Saskatchewan.

04:04.997 --> 04:08.222
- Yeah, what's with the shtickala?

04:08.222 --> 04:10.692
- He believes in the
healing power of laughter.

04:13.062 --> 04:15.482
- Well I'm not laughing.

04:20.192 --> 04:21.745
(girl laughs)

04:21.745 --> 04:24.060
- [doctor wearing yarmulke]
You have a dick on your face.

04:33.590 --> 04:36.675
- [Voiceover] Tonight,
a very special episode

04:36.675 --> 04:38.834
of Children's Hospital.

04:38.834 --> 04:41.440
- Hi, I am of course Cutter Spindel.

04:41.440 --> 04:44.007
I play Dr. Blake Downs
on Children's Hospital.

04:44.007 --> 04:45.312
My name is David Wain,

04:45.312 --> 04:47.024
I'm one of the producers
of Children's Hospital.

04:47.024 --> 04:48.748
Today we have an episode that

04:48.748 --> 04:51.150
can be described only as uh,

04:51.150 --> 04:52.863
I don't know what the word, different.

04:52.863 --> 04:53.792
- Different, yes.

04:53.792 --> 04:55.023
That's a great way to describe it.

04:55.023 --> 04:56.657
I like that a lot, different, you know?

04:56.657 --> 04:57.806
I like that a real lot.

04:57.806 --> 04:59.644
Because it really does
describe the episode.

04:59.644 --> 05:00.915
Different, I like that.

05:00.915 --> 05:02.132
- Well, I mean the reason why,

05:02.132 --> 05:04.182
is this episode is told entirely

05:04.182 --> 05:05.272
from the point of view

05:05.272 --> 05:07.281
of a visiting colleague from Puerto Rico.

05:07.281 --> 05:08.171
Who just happened--

05:08.171 --> 05:09.034
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa,

05:09.034 --> 05:10.176
actually, you know what?

05:10.176 --> 05:11.487
Let's not spoon feed it to them.

05:11.487 --> 05:12.962
We want to let the
audience use their brain.

05:12.962 --> 05:14.272
- I like that, yes.

05:14.272 --> 05:15.791
Because that's what
television is all about,

05:15.791 --> 05:16.882
using your brain.

05:16.882 --> 05:18.245
And what's very exciting is this episode

05:18.245 --> 05:22.073
is written and directed by
our very own, Cutter Spindel.

05:22.073 --> 05:22.812
- Guilty.

05:22.812 --> 05:24.236
- In his directorial debut.

05:24.236 --> 05:25.531
- Uh, not exactly.

05:25.531 --> 05:28.675
Um, I did direct Sisterhood
of the Traveling Pants.

05:28.675 --> 05:32.332
- That one I did not see,
and I did not care for.

05:33.222 --> 05:35.746
Please enjoy, this very special episode,

05:35.746 --> 05:37.861
of Children's Hospital.

05:37.861 --> 05:40.186
- Directed by Cutter Spindel.

05:43.729 --> 05:45.076
- I wonder when that visiting doctor

05:45.076 --> 05:46.293
is gonna get here.

05:46.293 --> 05:48.051
- I don't see him anywhere.

05:48.051 --> 05:49.127
- (short person) Excuse me.

05:49.127 --> 05:49.981
Is it the 5th floor?

05:49.981 --> 05:53.086
The numbers in the elevator
are too high up for me to see.

05:53.086 --> 05:55.533
- Oh my god, you're a midget.

05:55.533 --> 05:57.051
- And you're Puerto Rican.

05:57.051 --> 05:57.941
- What?

05:57.941 --> 05:59.853
- And you've got a little
piece of food right here.

05:59.853 --> 06:00.922
- That's just some hot sauce

06:00.922 --> 06:03.249
left over from my burrito.

06:03.249 --> 06:05.694
- I'm Chief, the chief here.

06:05.694 --> 06:07.241
Uh, we do things a little bit differently

06:07.241 --> 06:08.667
here at Children's doctor,

06:08.667 --> 06:10.091
but hopefully there are some techniques

06:10.091 --> 06:12.940
that you can pick up and
bring back home to Havana.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.654
- Bring our techniques
back to Puerto Rico,

06:14.654 --> 06:15.629
not our white women.

06:15.629 --> 06:16.368
- Okay (chuckles).

06:16.368 --> 06:18.086
- [visiting doctor] I do
hope that I can teach you

06:18.086 --> 06:19.401
some of our new inventions

06:19.401 --> 06:21.115
in Puerto Rican medicine.

06:21.115 --> 06:22.333
- Oh, I'd always wanted to learn

06:22.333 --> 06:26.088
how to breed fighting chickens.

06:26.088 --> 06:27.148
- [visiting doctor] Dear Papi.

06:27.148 --> 06:29.794
You'd like it here at Children's hospital.

06:29.794 --> 06:31.225
It's chaos, sure.

06:31.225 --> 06:33.714
But, organized chaos.

06:33.714 --> 06:35.797
It's like a graceful ballet.

06:35.797 --> 06:39.955
Or, like that funeral we
had for one of our dogs.

06:41.547 --> 06:42.600
- First off,

06:42.600 --> 06:44.079
there's the Chief.

06:44.079 --> 06:45.342
Get this Papi,

06:45.342 --> 06:47.979
a woman is the chief.

06:47.979 --> 06:49.001
(bell rings)

06:49.001 --> 06:50.016
- Oh, uh oh.

06:50.016 --> 06:52.462
Looks like it's time to
turn off the MRI machine.

06:52.462 --> 06:54.746
- [child in machine] It smells
like Thanksgiving in here,

06:54.746 --> 06:55.878
but bad.

06:55.878 --> 06:56.861
(laughs nervously)

06:56.861 --> 06:59.104
- [visiting doctor] You'd
love the guppers here Papi.

06:59.104 --> 07:00.938
They word hard.

07:00.938 --> 07:04.360
- Time of death, 5:59.

07:04.360 --> 07:09.360
- Time of dry humping
in supply closet, 6:01.

07:10.505 --> 07:13.564
(door opens and closes)

07:19.686 --> 07:21.164
(door closes)

07:21.164 --> 07:23.342
(door opens)

07:23.342 --> 07:25.579
- Sorry, was that your
fist, what was that?

07:25.579 --> 07:30.465
(door opens and shuts)

07:30.465 --> 07:32.777
(baby giggling)

07:32.777 --> 07:34.587
(door closes)

07:38.187 --> 07:40.618
(both laughing)

07:40.618 --> 07:42.656
- [visiting doctor] But,
you get all the doctors here

07:42.656 --> 07:43.759
in one room

07:43.759 --> 07:45.963
and you understand why they all work

07:45.963 --> 07:47.555
so well together.

07:47.555 --> 07:50.493
They almost have their own family, Papi.

07:50.493 --> 07:52.566
Only, they don't have a Jeep.

07:52.566 --> 07:54.456
- Jefe, check this out.

07:54.456 --> 07:56.331
- [Chief] No, but I gotta.

07:56.331 --> 07:58.285
- [visiting doctor] Oh,
my mustache is now a mess.

07:58.285 --> 07:59.874
Oh where is the mirror?

07:59.874 --> 08:03.129
I must oil it again.

08:10.485 --> 08:12.650
(farts)

08:15.752 --> 08:17.741
(gasping)

08:17.741 --> 08:19.403
(gun hits floor)

08:19.403 --> 08:21.802
- Rob, what's going on?

08:21.802 --> 08:24.084
- Uh, I had that dream again.

08:24.084 --> 08:25.195
- What dream?

08:25.195 --> 08:26.778
- The one about the children's hospital.

08:26.778 --> 08:28.081
- Oh.

08:28.081 --> 08:30.774
- It all took place inside a
Puerto Rican midget's fart.

08:30.774 --> 08:33.254
- Its just a dream.

08:33.254 --> 08:36.677
- It doesn't make any sense.

08:36.677 --> 08:38.104
- Rob, go back to sleep.

08:38.104 --> 08:40.187
Don't forget to set the snow globe.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.308
- You're right Megan Mullally.

08:42.308 --> 08:43.601
Good night.

08:43.601 --> 08:45.163
- Good night Rob Corddry.

08:52.017 --> 08:53.798
- Oh, wow!

08:53.798 --> 08:54.903
- Thank you.

08:54.903 --> 08:56.140
- Very powerful.

08:56.140 --> 08:57.284
I mean when did you get the idea

08:57.284 --> 08:59.288
that this whole world
of Children's Hospital,

08:59.288 --> 09:02.587
takes place inside this
Puerto Rican midget's fart?

09:02.587 --> 09:04.423
- I think we've always known.

09:04.423 --> 09:06.464
You know, so as I was writing it,

09:06.464 --> 09:09.600
it occurred to me that
the Puerto Rican midget

09:09.600 --> 09:11.675
is almost a character itself.

09:11.675 --> 09:14.529
- Well I mean, he really
literally was a character,

09:14.529 --> 09:15.510
- Right, right right.

09:15.510 --> 09:17.680
It sort of had that feeling,
so why not write it?

09:17.680 --> 09:20.081
- It really literally was
a character in the show.

09:20.081 --> 09:23.104
- And that's the feeling
I wanted to bring to it.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.314
- Huh.

09:24.314 --> 09:27.013
Well thanks everyone, for
tuning into this special episode

09:27.013 --> 09:28.277
of Children's Hospital.

09:28.277 --> 09:30.925
Tune it next week for a regular one.

09:30.925 --> 09:33.400
- Uh, I have a real treat
for fans of the show.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.735
I have with us here,

09:35.735 --> 09:38.652
the actual person upon whom the character,

09:38.652 --> 09:41.410
Dr. Blake Downs, was based.

09:41.410 --> 09:44.882
So without further ado,
ladies and gentlemen,

09:44.882 --> 09:46.822
the real Dr. Blake Downs,

09:46.822 --> 09:49.355
Dr. Blake Downs!

09:51.189 --> 09:53.015
I think he's asleep.

09:53.015 --> 09:54.844
Okay, I have another treat for you.

09:54.844 --> 09:57.459
You'll notice in that last episode,

09:57.459 --> 10:01.054
David Wain, one of the producers
of Children's Hospital,

10:01.054 --> 10:03.466
presents me without the makeup on,

10:03.466 --> 10:04.848
as Cutter Spindel,

10:04.848 --> 10:08.317
the actor that plays Dr.
Blake Downs in the series,

10:08.317 --> 10:09.844
I know it's very confusing but,

10:09.844 --> 10:13.527
I actually have here the
person that Cutter Spindel

10:13.527 --> 10:15.324
was based on as well.

10:15.324 --> 10:19.554
So ladies and gentlemen,
the real Cutter Spindel,
