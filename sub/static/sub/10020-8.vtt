WEBVTT

00:03.867 --> 00:06.830
ER

00:06.832 --> 00:08.128
Previously on ER...

00:08.129 --> 00:10.045
- Are you firing me?
- Jeanie, I'm sorry.

00:10.046 --> 00:13.749
Oh, jeez! Your clinic proposal.
That's tonight, isn't it?

00:13.750 --> 00:15.755
Yeah, Oak Park, 7:00.
That's what we said.

00:15.756 --> 00:18.723
Your husband lied
to you about his condition!

00:18.724 --> 00:20.391
He's going to die!

00:20.392 --> 00:22.051
Peter Benton, Rocket Romano.

00:22.052 --> 00:25.756
Dr. Benton. Hey, Lizzie's
talked about you.

00:26.287 --> 00:28.118
I don't usually do this kind of thing.

00:28.119 --> 00:29.615
Sure. That's what they all say.

00:29.616 --> 00:31.938
My family has a few bucks
and everything changes?

00:31.939 --> 00:32.939
A few bucks? Is that what it is to you?

00:37.937 --> 00:40.896
Freak Show

00:45.164 --> 00:46.328
Carol!

00:48.129 --> 00:50.968
Man, look at you! I hardly sleep
a wink on the redeye...

00:51.178 --> 00:53.388
...and you're jogging and smiling.

00:53.601 --> 00:57.057
There's nothing like a visit with the folks
to make you appreciate home.

00:57.276 --> 00:58.689
The staff will be thrilled.

00:58.863 --> 01:01.987
You haven't been too high
on the popularity list lately.

01:02.205 --> 01:04.533
- I've been kind of a jerk.
- Worse.

01:04.751 --> 01:06.712
- Pain in the ass?
- Keep going.

01:06.882 --> 01:08.593
- Total schmuck.
- Bingo.

01:08.804 --> 01:12.177
We all understood. It's just
we're glad you're getting over it.

01:12.521 --> 01:15.859
You know, that meant a lot to Doug,
you showing up like that.

01:16.071 --> 01:17.698
It meant a lot to me too.

01:18.076 --> 01:19.572
I almost forgot.

01:20.039 --> 01:22.165
I found this when I unpacked.

01:23.255 --> 01:27.340
- "CH"?
- Yeah. "Carol Hathaway. " It's from "DR. "

01:27.557 --> 01:30.431
- Did you read it?
- No. But I was tempted.

01:31.190 --> 01:34.112
Anna? Can you come in here
and give me a hand?

01:34.323 --> 01:37.114
- What have you got?
- A shoulder reduction on a boxer.

01:37.288 --> 01:39.034
Coach made him take ballet.

01:39.251 --> 01:40.332
I'll do traction.

01:40.546 --> 01:42.791
Then I will give you countertraction.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.466
Thanks, Lily.

01:46.351 --> 01:48.596
- So how have you been?
- Fine.

01:48.815 --> 01:51.774
On my count. One, two, three.

01:53.284 --> 01:56.824
- Seen any interesting cases?
- No. Not really.

01:57.043 --> 01:59.003
- Done any interesting procedures?
- Nope.

01:59.340 --> 02:02.180
- You wanna grab some breakfast?
- I'm not hungry. Thanks.

02:02.348 --> 02:04.308
- What? Are you still angry?
- I'm over it.

02:04.519 --> 02:05.719
You sure?

02:06.190 --> 02:08.649
Can we just focus
on the patient, please?

02:10.241 --> 02:12.736
- Hey! Cute little bugger.
- Thanks.

02:13.416 --> 02:14.912
I bet he keeps you pretty busy.

02:15.128 --> 02:18.252
Actually, he lives with his mother.
So I see him when I can.

02:18.469 --> 02:20.299
What about you? You got any kids?

02:20.516 --> 02:22.392
None they've been able to pin on me.

02:23.439 --> 02:26.694
You know, Peter, you've been
on my mind lately.

02:27.407 --> 02:30.198
You made the short list for my team.
You still interested?

02:30.874 --> 02:31.955
Sure.

02:33.255 --> 02:35.749
- I just have a couple of reservations.
- Reservations?

02:35.928 --> 02:36.960
Yeah.

02:37.723 --> 02:41.596
I need a team player. Someone who is
compatible with Lizzie Corday.

02:41.775 --> 02:46.740
Now, word has it you and she have had
a couple of run-ins.

02:47.789 --> 02:50.462
We've had our differences,
but we've worked them out.

02:50.629 --> 02:52.506
Differences can be healthy.

02:53.093 --> 02:54.804
Can you keep up with her?

02:55.140 --> 02:56.340
Absolutely.

02:57.521 --> 02:58.981
Do you have the time?

03:00.402 --> 03:01.483
Sure.

03:03.117 --> 03:04.150
Great.

03:04.955 --> 03:07.960
We'll do a trial run,
see if we're all compatible.

03:08.254 --> 03:10.084
And then I'll make my final decision.

03:14.478 --> 03:15.724
What's going on?

03:15.939 --> 03:17.602
Mark, when did you get back?

03:17.777 --> 03:18.810
Hi. Late last night.

03:18.988 --> 03:22.528
- What are these people doing here?
- They're patients for your new clinic.

03:22.706 --> 03:25.081
No. The clinic doesn't open
until next week.

03:25.253 --> 03:27.415
You said to put the announcement
in for today.

03:27.592 --> 03:30.087
No. I said next week.

03:30.432 --> 03:31.893
Oh, man!

03:32.061 --> 03:34.222
Oh, I'm really sorry.

03:34.484 --> 03:36.645
Is there anything that I can do?

03:38.326 --> 03:40.202
Start giving out numbers.

03:42.000 --> 03:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:31.202 --> 04:32.579
Hey, everybody, listen up.

04:32.789 --> 04:34.784
I need volunteers
to come back next week.

04:35.003 --> 04:36.962
You'll get on the front of the line.

04:37.639 --> 04:39.884
No? Then everyone
has to be really patient.

04:40.062 --> 04:41.557
Tell that to my boss.

04:41.731 --> 04:43.857
- Bryan, baby.
- Oh, miss...

04:44.029 --> 04:46.605
...I can't keep standing like this.
I've got the gout.

04:46.784 --> 04:48.613
Take a chair.
Anyone else need a chair?

04:48.789 --> 04:50.166
Stop jumping up and down.

04:50.376 --> 04:52.454
Wait over in Chairs.
Take a number.

04:52.672 --> 04:56.341
Twenty-seven? I might as well
be waiting six hours in the ER.

04:56.555 --> 04:58.681
Go ahead. That would
help me out a lot.

04:59.020 --> 05:00.136
Carol?

05:00.481 --> 05:03.901
Kerry, hi. Did Mark tell you
about the scheduling snafu?

05:04.072 --> 05:06.067
Very unfortunate.
I need to talk with you.

05:06.243 --> 05:07.324
I'm a little busy now.

05:07.496 --> 05:09.242
Weren't you scheduled
to work the ER?

05:09.417 --> 05:11.495
I had to take the day off
to run the clinic.

05:11.672 --> 05:14.926
- Could you spare anyone to help?
- When I signed off on the clinic...

05:15.097 --> 05:17.305
...you promised to find
your own personnel...

05:17.476 --> 05:19.887
...and it wouldn't impinge
on your regular duties.

05:20.066 --> 05:22.986
I could turf the runny noses,
BP checks over to the ER...

05:23.155 --> 05:24.985
...and have your personnel
handle them.

05:25.160 --> 05:27.488
- Okay. I'll give you Yosh Takata.
- Who?

05:27.707 --> 05:29.369
Nursing Administration.

05:29.586 --> 05:31.877
Excuse me.
Transfer from upstairs.

05:33.344 --> 05:37.014
Why don't you talk to my friend
at the Gay and Lesbian Defense Fund?

05:37.186 --> 05:40.025
They represent people with HIV
and AIDS who have been fired.

05:40.235 --> 05:43.441
Maggie, thanks for your concern,
but that's not what happened.

05:43.658 --> 05:44.691
Sure.

05:45.413 --> 05:48.702
You're the best P.A. we have.
I just hate to see you give up.

05:48.920 --> 05:50.749
I'm not giving up. I'm moving on.

05:51.175 --> 05:54.513
Al's in Atlanta checking out leads
and a couple of construction jobs.

05:54.683 --> 05:57.604
But it's illegal for them to fire you
for being HIV-positive.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.900
- You think that's why they fired me?
- You don't?

06:01.907 --> 06:05.612
No. They could've done that last year.
It's because of the budget.

06:12.221 --> 06:14.631
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:15.186 --> 06:17.395
- I missed you.
- Me too.

06:17.608 --> 06:20.280
You did? Because you didn't call.

06:20.489 --> 06:23.328
Well, we were on the road
the whole time but...

06:23.537 --> 06:25.532
So I wasn't able to wrap it.

06:26.294 --> 06:27.790
What's this?

06:28.673 --> 06:33.176
Oh, it's beautiful! Thank you!
I love it!

06:33.560 --> 06:35.269
Oh, my-!
Would you latch it for me?

06:35.438 --> 06:36.471
Sure.

06:37.819 --> 06:40.989
The guy at the shop said that
it is a genuine diamond.

06:41.159 --> 06:43.155
A real diamond.

06:43.331 --> 06:47.333
No one has ever gotten me a real
diamond before, Mark. I love it.

06:48.384 --> 06:50.129
- Pardon us.
- Welcome back.

06:50.346 --> 06:51.807
There's no place like home.

06:52.016 --> 06:53.513
This coffee's terrible.

06:54.689 --> 06:57.017
I'm really awful in the kitchen.
Sorry.

06:57.194 --> 06:59.190
I think it tastes really good.

07:01.370 --> 07:03.199
- What do we got?
- Twelve-year-old boy.

07:03.375 --> 07:07.163
Hit-and-run on his way to school.
GCS 7. Got routine blood work.

07:07.383 --> 07:12.300
Chest and abdominal films, C-spine.
BP's funky, 80 palp.

07:12.979 --> 07:16.316
Gave him two units O-neg. The name
on this notebook says Rodney Price.

07:16.486 --> 07:19.527
There's a mass in the upper left
quadrant. Abdomen is distended.

07:19.702 --> 07:20.734
Crit's falling, 26.

07:20.913 --> 07:24.037
Bleeding internally. I'll hang
another unit on the rapid infuser.

07:24.212 --> 07:26.920
- He ruptured his spleen.
- Biggest spleen I've ever felt.

07:27.093 --> 07:29.302
- Got the wet reads.
- Great.

07:30.267 --> 07:31.347
Here's the shadow.

07:31.561 --> 07:34.650
That's the hematoma pressing down
on the splenic flexure.

07:34.860 --> 07:36.486
- Looks like a rupture.
- No, no.

07:36.697 --> 07:38.324
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

07:38.535 --> 07:39.699
The film's mislabeled.

07:39.913 --> 07:43.416
The gastric bubble is under the right
diaphragm instead of the left.

07:43.629 --> 07:46.966
But with a splenic rupture,
the gastric bubble can be displaced.

07:47.178 --> 07:49.257
No, no, no.
Not that much it can't...

07:49.476 --> 07:52.848
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute!
That's not his spleen. That's his liver.

07:53.025 --> 07:54.521
The liver's in the wrong place.

07:54.695 --> 07:57.105
- Backwards?
- His abdominal organs are reversed.

07:57.326 --> 07:58.358
That's remarkable.

07:58.537 --> 08:00.497
Let's get him up to Surgery! Move!

08:00.667 --> 08:02.246
Ever do a case like this before?

08:02.420 --> 08:04.249
No. This is one in a million.

08:04.467 --> 08:06.509
All right, everybody. Page Romano!

08:06.680 --> 08:09.352
- You have previous clinic experience?
- A little.

08:09.561 --> 08:11.935
- Where would that have been?
- Chart Review.

08:12.108 --> 08:14.187
You don't see many patients
in Chart Review.

08:14.363 --> 08:16.025
No. But I know a lot about them.

08:16.201 --> 08:18.279
We'll have to double up
on patients in here.

08:18.455 --> 08:21.080
- Be with you in a minute.
- You said that an hour ago.

08:21.254 --> 08:24.211
Sign in patients, start a chart,
and check their vitals.

08:24.385 --> 08:25.715
- Where?
- Out here.

08:25.889 --> 08:30.306
If anyone seems the least bit emergent,
take them over to ER Triage.

08:30.524 --> 08:31.806
Can you handle that?

08:32.152 --> 08:34.823
- If I have any questions, I'll holler.
- Great. Mark!

08:34.991 --> 08:36.868
Oh, bring the kid out here, please.

08:37.038 --> 08:39.198
- Do you have a sec?
- I gotta get to Radiology.

08:39.376 --> 08:42.880
But I got a triple failure otitis media
that needs a scrip for Augmentin.

08:43.092 --> 08:45.171
All right. How's it going, Carol?

08:45.389 --> 08:47.765
You know, I would've been
organized by next week.

08:48.813 --> 08:51.023
You couldn't help me at all today?

08:51.236 --> 08:53.776
Well, it's a little busy
not having Doug here.

08:53.991 --> 08:57.199
- But I'll see what I can do.
- All right. I appreciate it.

08:58.168 --> 09:01.457
- I think Carol's mad at me.
- No. She's just got a lot on her mind.

09:01.633 --> 09:04.590
That hospital lawyer dropped off
these papers for you to sign.

09:04.765 --> 09:06.891
They're urgent,
about the civil rights case.

09:07.062 --> 09:09.187
- File them in my box.
- Along with the others?

09:09.358 --> 09:11.817
Yeah. I'm not gonna let
these bastards get to me.

09:13.159 --> 09:14.702
The man of the hour's arrived.

09:14.870 --> 09:17.329
- This is the situs inversus?
- It sure is.

09:17.501 --> 09:20.921
Fantastic case, Peter. I've never
seen one in the flesh before.

09:21.134 --> 09:22.928
It's worth considering a case report.

09:23.139 --> 09:25.679
I'm actually thinking of running
a literature review.

09:25.853 --> 09:29.689
I took the liberty. There's nothing
on abdominal situs inversus in Trauma.

09:29.861 --> 09:31.856
I can be the first to write about it.

09:32.033 --> 09:35.406
I just heard the good news.
You've got a nose for sniffing out zebras.

09:35.582 --> 09:37.708
I wish I could take credit,
but he landed it.

09:37.879 --> 09:40.967
- Finders, keepers.
- Peter won't mind you scrubbing in.

09:41.136 --> 09:43.891
- Give us a chance to work together.
- I think he might.

09:45.228 --> 09:46.344
No. No. Of course not.

09:46.565 --> 09:47.597
Great.

09:47.776 --> 09:50.352
You both can run it.
I'll hang out on the sidelines...

09:50.531 --> 09:53.655
...in case I have to take one of you out.
Shall we scrub?

09:56.586 --> 09:57.619
So...

09:58.132 --> 10:00.211
Don't you think it's time
we called a truce?

10:00.428 --> 10:02.304
I am not at war.

10:02.516 --> 10:05.272
I feel terrible.
I didn't mean to mislead you...

10:05.440 --> 10:08.064
- ... about my family.
- It's not that big a deal, okay?

10:08.237 --> 10:10.113
- No hard feelings?
- No.

10:10.618 --> 10:12.909
Excuse me, John.
I hope I'm not interrupting.

10:13.123 --> 10:15.700
- Henry! What are you doing here?
- I wanna thank you...

10:15.878 --> 10:18.967
...for giving me time
to finish my brain blots.

10:19.136 --> 10:21.261
- Grab the end of that, please.
- The end?

10:21.474 --> 10:24.930
The results are so promising, I got
a Howard Hughes Research Fellowship.

10:25.149 --> 10:26.479
- Glad I could help.
- You did.

10:26.694 --> 10:30.364
I was wondering if you might
do me one more favor here.

10:30.578 --> 10:33.666
- Favor, huh?
- See, I'm not able to- Excuse me.

10:33.876 --> 10:37.831
I can't start a new rotation until you
remove these UEs from my evaluation.

10:38.010 --> 10:39.388
So if you could just...

10:39.806 --> 10:42.134
"Unable to evaluate
physical examination.

10:42.353 --> 10:44.847
Unable to evaluate technical
and procedural skills.

10:45.026 --> 10:47.864
Unable to evaluate interactions
with the health care team. "

10:48.032 --> 10:49.742
Yeah. You can't just pass me?

10:50.371 --> 10:51.867
No. You barely showed up.

10:52.041 --> 10:55.878
Then the registrar says that I need
to repeat this clerkship until I pass.

10:56.217 --> 10:58.046
Anna, you don't have a student,
do you?

10:58.221 --> 10:59.421
Don't need one.

11:00.560 --> 11:03.600
Well, then, I guess
it's just you and me.

11:05.700 --> 11:07.528
Jeanie, I've been looking for you.

11:07.704 --> 11:09.035
Well, you found me.

11:09.208 --> 11:10.408
Good news.

11:10.837 --> 11:14.543
Atlanta Memorial called.
They're very interested in you.

11:14.763 --> 11:18.682
I faxed an excellent recommendation.
You should be a shoo-in for a position.

11:18.897 --> 11:20.560
Thank you.

11:21.112 --> 11:25.697
Jeanie, if there were any way I could
change things, believe me, I would.

11:26.750 --> 11:28.911
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I know.

11:34.693 --> 11:36.985
There is no way we can take
these people today.

11:37.157 --> 11:39.115
Come back next week,
they get priority.

11:39.285 --> 11:41.279
You refuse to give
the homeless physicals?

11:41.456 --> 11:44.745
I am not refusing. We don't
have any more appointments for today.

11:44.920 --> 11:48.674
But I called two hours ago and a lady
said that this was a walk-in clinic day.

11:48.846 --> 11:50.175
Cynthia!

11:50.348 --> 11:52.759
Did you give permission
to bring in these people?

11:52.937 --> 11:54.349
I figured it would be okay.

11:54.522 --> 11:57.480
Are you a complete idiot?
Can't you see we're swamped already?

11:57.654 --> 11:59.198
- I'm sorry.
- What's going on?

11:59.366 --> 12:02.322
She invited the entire Hazelton Shelter
for free physicals.

12:02.539 --> 12:03.951
Carol, can I talk to you?

12:05.961 --> 12:08.170
So there was miscommunication.

12:08.341 --> 12:11.548
If you have a problem with Cynthia
or any employee in the future...

12:11.722 --> 12:16.021
...speak to them privately. Don't dress
them down in front of the entire ER.

12:17.191 --> 12:19.400
- Anything else?
- No.

12:22.644 --> 12:24.890
Liver's lacerated.
Excise the left lateral aspect.

12:25.067 --> 12:27.145
- Which anatomically is the right lobe.
- Correct.

12:27.363 --> 12:29.524
I don't know about you,
but I'm getting dizzy.

12:29.744 --> 12:33.282
- We should put a mirror on the ceiling.
- We could operate from my bedroom.

12:33.502 --> 12:37.551
Get a photo from the other side.
Peter, expose the gallbladder.

12:38.638 --> 12:41.178
- Found any family on this kid yet?
- Not last I heard.

12:41.393 --> 12:43.722
Get on it. I wanna get
releases for these photos.

12:43.941 --> 12:45.104
Liver's still bleeding.

12:45.277 --> 12:47.438
- You ever use an argon beam coagulator?
- No.

12:47.657 --> 12:50.151
Why don't I do the Pringle maneuver?

12:50.371 --> 12:51.486
Go for it.

12:51.665 --> 12:55.086
My colleague would love to get
some blood samples from this kid.

12:55.299 --> 12:56.414
Suction, please.

12:56.592 --> 12:57.674
All right.

12:59.182 --> 13:01.936
Here we go. All right. Heads up.

13:02.898 --> 13:06.236
Have Pathology pickle this. Bet no one's
ever seen a backwards liver.

13:06.405 --> 13:09.575
- We can play "Stump the Med Students. "
- Not to mention publishing.

13:09.747 --> 13:11.657
- We discussed that.
- Are you up for it?

13:11.833 --> 13:12.866
- I'm game.
- So am I.

13:13.044 --> 13:17.129
Excellent. We'll fight over whose name
goes first on the papers later.

13:17.303 --> 13:18.467
It's a wrist.

13:18.681 --> 13:20.725
That's definitely
a fracture of the wrist.

13:20.937 --> 13:23.857
Yeah. But there are eight bones
in the wrist. Which one?

13:25.488 --> 13:27.946
What are the odds
of catching TB in this place?

13:28.160 --> 13:29.622
Henry, which bone is broken?

13:29.831 --> 13:32.205
- It's the lunate.
- No. That's over here.

13:32.420 --> 13:34.878
Here. Remember this, would you?
It's a mnemonic.

13:35.343 --> 13:39.558
Never Lower Tillie's Pants.
Mother May Come Home.

13:39.768 --> 13:42.061
Maybe you boys should talk privately.

13:42.608 --> 13:43.938
No, I'm just...

13:44.236 --> 13:46.197
...teaching Henry
the bones in the wrist.

13:47.661 --> 13:48.860
Here.

13:49.498 --> 13:52.253
"M" for "Mother" is
the greater multangular.

13:52.463 --> 13:55.918
You call that the multangular?
I was taught it was the trapezium.

13:56.096 --> 13:58.506
- Really?
- I call that the scaphoid.

13:58.684 --> 14:00.763
- What do you call it?
- Navicular.

14:02.276 --> 14:05.399
So my little mnemonic
wouldn't work for you.

14:05.575 --> 14:08.248
- That's okay. I have my own.
- Really? Let's hear it.

14:09.876 --> 14:10.907
Okay.

14:13.443 --> 14:14.939
Scared Lovers...

14:15.154 --> 14:19.700
...Try Positions That They Can't Handle.

14:20.121 --> 14:22.116
- Go with Anna's.
- He already learned yours.

14:22.293 --> 14:23.324
I like yours better.

14:23.503 --> 14:26.176
I don't think that I need either.
I'll just...

14:27.051 --> 14:28.167
...memorize the names.

14:32.019 --> 14:33.265
Excuse me.

14:35.220 --> 14:39.518
If Dr. Anspaugh calls, tell him I'll
have this budget in his hands today.

14:39.989 --> 14:41.949
- Do you know who left this note?
- No.

14:42.160 --> 14:44.535
- "CH". That's me.
- Dr. Weaver?

14:44.707 --> 14:46.702
You drive a Plymouth?
Your lights are on.

14:46.878 --> 14:48.292
That's hard to believe.

14:48.466 --> 14:51.136
Herb Spivak, snakebite
to the upper left torso.

14:51.303 --> 14:52.680
- Know what the venom is?
- No.

14:52.850 --> 14:55.686
It has feet like a piranha,
and a head the size of a papaya.

14:55.854 --> 14:58.693
Can you take this non-venomous
snakebite to the left thorax?

14:58.861 --> 15:01.352
- I left my car lights on.
- Sure. Curtain Area 3.

15:01.531 --> 15:04.489
Can you sign off on this budget?
Anspaugh's expecting it.

15:04.663 --> 15:07.336
- Where?
- Below my signature. I'll be back.

15:07.503 --> 15:08.584
How did this happen?

15:08.796 --> 15:10.541
I was feeding his python. It bit me.

15:10.717 --> 15:12.546
What do you expect?
You spilled soup.

15:12.721 --> 15:13.967
- Who are you?
- Gary Lomax.

15:14.182 --> 15:16.094
Owner of Jungle Gary's Reptorium.

15:16.312 --> 15:18.520
- He spilled chicken soup on himself.
- What?

15:18.691 --> 15:21.363
Pythons love chicken,
so I dipped the rat in my soup.

15:21.530 --> 15:23.942
It spilled on my jacket.
Bingo! The guy got me.

15:24.120 --> 15:26.576
Python thought he was
the world's biggest chicken.

15:28.712 --> 15:29.828
Ellis?

15:30.549 --> 15:32.091
Fancy meeting you here!

15:32.300 --> 15:33.880
Security said my lights were on.

15:34.055 --> 15:37.808
A little ruse to get you out so I could
thank you for getting us the contract.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.939
- Anspaugh approved it?
- Ink's still wet.

15:40.149 --> 15:43.736
Synergix is now supplying extra
Attending coverage to County General.

15:43.907 --> 15:46.782
- All because of you.
- Why didn't you come into the hospital?

15:46.955 --> 15:49.745
I wanted to avoid suggestion
of preferential treatment.

15:49.920 --> 15:52.413
It's not preferential treatment.
It's good business.

15:52.592 --> 15:56.464
We have that in common. It's good
business for me to say thanks.

15:59.188 --> 16:00.731
- Thanks, Kerry.
- Phalaenopsis.

16:00.941 --> 16:02.935
Ellis, you shouldn't have.

16:03.112 --> 16:04.858
- You know phals?
- I love them.

16:05.284 --> 16:06.863
Something else we have in common.

16:09.042 --> 16:11.831
Great job. You really drained
the hell out of that liver.

16:12.005 --> 16:15.342
Once I got my bearings, it wasn't
difficult. I'm glad it came along.

16:15.512 --> 16:18.386
Me too. But a compass
would've been helpful.

16:18.560 --> 16:21.931
Check the crits and coags. Make sure
the Jackson Pratts don't clot off.

16:22.107 --> 16:23.653
Catalog the photos and dig up...

16:23.821 --> 16:26.575
...every article you can find
on situs inversus viscerum.

16:26.744 --> 16:30.197
I'll watch the temp. If it drops below 35,
I'll use a warming blanket.

16:30.374 --> 16:33.212
I'll alert the Genetics Department,
if they want to consult.

16:33.422 --> 16:36.297
Dr. Romano, this is Mr. Price.
Rodney's father.

16:36.513 --> 16:37.794
The school called.

16:38.015 --> 16:40.639
Told me there was an accident,
to come right over.

16:41.689 --> 16:42.721
How is my boy doing?

16:42.899 --> 16:45.476
We removed part of his liver
to control the bleeding.

16:45.655 --> 16:48.409
He's in serious condition
but he came out of surgery well.

16:48.618 --> 16:50.199
Aren't you...

16:50.415 --> 16:51.827
...Peter Benton?

16:52.044 --> 16:53.836
- From Collins High?
- Yeah.

16:54.047 --> 16:56.587
Isaac Price.

16:56.760 --> 16:58.222
You two were classmates?

16:58.432 --> 17:01.470
Yeah. Class of '83.
Peter was on that college track.

17:01.771 --> 17:02.935
Nose to the grindstone.

17:03.148 --> 17:05.771
It paid off. Your son had
an excellent surgeon.

17:06.446 --> 17:09.983
Isaac, is your son on any medication
or allergic to any drugs?

17:10.203 --> 17:11.450
I don't know.

17:12.542 --> 17:14.288
He lives at his mother's.

17:15.964 --> 17:17.759
Listen, is Rodney gonna be all right?

17:19.347 --> 17:21.175
You know, we're doing our best, man.

17:25.568 --> 17:26.598
Damn it. Damn it.

17:26.778 --> 17:29.070
- Can I help?
- No. You've done plenty. Thanks.

17:29.286 --> 17:32.073
Carol, move your patients
out of the Admit area.

17:32.288 --> 17:34.285
We could get cited
for blocking fire exits.

17:34.461 --> 17:36.869
Dr. Doyle, did you want
your December meal tickets?

17:37.047 --> 17:38.843
- Who has time to eat?
- I'll take them.

17:39.011 --> 17:42.014
- They're for the residents.
- You heard. Who has time to eat?

17:43.561 --> 17:47.267
You're going to need
a tetanus booster, antibiotics.

17:47.487 --> 17:49.814
And I'll have to extract
those python teeth.

17:50.035 --> 17:52.740
- Okay, doctor.
- Malik, can you get me some Betadine?

17:52.955 --> 17:54.951
I brought Flora along...

17:55.169 --> 17:57.660
- ... in case you wanted to swab her.
- Flora?

17:57.881 --> 18:00.841
- She's actually quite gentle-
- When she's not hungry.

18:01.055 --> 18:02.170
How do you know?

18:02.349 --> 18:06.053
- She's harmless except for mouth rot.
- You think we should get a culture?

18:06.231 --> 18:08.903
I love her dearly.
But her mouth's a cesspool.

18:09.070 --> 18:10.104
Malik...

18:10.323 --> 18:12.069
...you wanna give him a hand?

18:12.286 --> 18:13.661
I don't think so.

18:13.871 --> 18:16.247
Just grab her middle. Don't let go.

18:23.851 --> 18:27.389
This next case of situs inversus...

18:27.942 --> 18:31.314
...apparently shows
no cardiac involvement.

18:31.532 --> 18:32.944
Dr. Benton.

18:33.160 --> 18:34.870
This is a great teaching case.

18:35.080 --> 18:37.408
I discussed it with the residents
and students.

18:37.627 --> 18:40.798
Dr. Benton and Dr. Corday
performed the surgery.

18:40.968 --> 18:43.970
Photographs were taken.
Everybody would love to see them.

18:44.181 --> 18:46.640
We need to change
the patient's dressings.

18:46.812 --> 18:48.973
No problem. We'll come back later.

18:49.150 --> 18:52.854
This is great work, Peter.
Don't forget those photos.

18:53.658 --> 18:55.819
- Anspaugh's impressed.
- Yeah. Here.

18:55.997 --> 18:58.871
- How's the kid doing?
- He's stable. Here.

19:00.464 --> 19:02.174
Lucky break, the father knowing you.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.966
Should make it easier to consent him
for blood tests.

19:05.643 --> 19:09.262
Genetic breakthroughs are hovering in
the winds. You'll talk to the family?

19:10.233 --> 19:11.433
- Yeah.
- Yeah, great.

19:13.239 --> 19:15.316
- Peter, is something wrong?
- No.

19:15.952 --> 19:18.874
- I'd be happy to talk to the father.
- Why?

19:19.377 --> 19:22.215
I thought it might be more comfortable
since you know him.

19:22.383 --> 19:24.792
I don't know him.
What difference would it make?

19:24.971 --> 19:27.097
It's tough if you have
a personal connection.

19:27.310 --> 19:29.551
I don't have a personal connection.

19:30.733 --> 19:32.894
I don't want him to think
we're using his kid.

19:33.071 --> 19:35.399
We've treated him as best we can,
haven't we?

19:35.659 --> 19:38.413
- Yeah.
- Then you've got nothing to worry about.

19:44.969 --> 19:47.927
- Excuse me.
- My fault. I'm not used to the floor plan.

19:48.101 --> 19:51.936
- I don't think we've met. I'm Jeanie.
- Yosh Takata. New R.N.

19:53.236 --> 19:54.897
The new R.N.?

19:55.531 --> 19:57.610
How'd you get past the hiring freeze?

19:58.078 --> 20:01.997
I didn't know there was one.
I put in for a transfer to the ER.

20:02.212 --> 20:05.215
- How long you been here? Do you like it?
- Two years. I do.

20:06.304 --> 20:08.215
It's good to meet you. I gotta run.

20:11.395 --> 20:14.068
- How did you get these scars?
- Defending a cave diver.

20:14.277 --> 20:16.354
We got caught in a kelp forest.
Do you dive?

20:16.573 --> 20:19.447
- No.
- Oh, spectacular.

20:20.455 --> 20:22.167
When did you start handling snakes?

20:22.336 --> 20:23.878
He's defending me in a lawsuit.

20:24.088 --> 20:25.667
- Oh, you're an attorney.
- Yeah.

20:25.883 --> 20:28.128
Flora ate his neighbor's
Jack Russell terrier.

20:28.347 --> 20:30.341
Obviously, they have
no case whatsoever.

20:30.517 --> 20:32.976
They're not recognized
by the American Kennel Association.

20:33.149 --> 20:36.768
Gary offered to help me work with
snakes in exchange for legal counsel.

20:36.945 --> 20:38.526
How could I refuse such an offer?

20:41.832 --> 20:43.292
Sure, Al. I know.

20:43.502 --> 20:46.340
I know. Okay. I love you too. Bye.

20:48.178 --> 20:49.459
- You okay?
- Yeah.

20:49.638 --> 20:52.310
Just Al. Foreman job
in Atlanta fell through.

20:52.477 --> 20:54.556
I'm sorry. Does he have
other possibilities?

20:54.774 --> 20:57.182
Al always does.
Let me give you a hand.

20:57.361 --> 20:58.906
- Thanks.
- How's it going for you?

20:59.074 --> 21:02.529
Lousy. I don't know why I thought
I could run a clinic with no supplies.

21:02.707 --> 21:05.199
- I can't even write a scrip.
- P.A.'s can write them.

21:05.378 --> 21:08.336
But Kerry Weaver won't let me
use any of the ER staff.

21:08.509 --> 21:10.054
What's she gonna do? Fire me?

21:12.481 --> 21:13.646
Mark.

21:14.821 --> 21:17.149
You are so romantic.

21:17.327 --> 21:18.406
I am?

21:21.126 --> 21:22.871
Hiding that note under the charts.

21:23.089 --> 21:25.843
My heart skipped a beat
when I saw my initials.

21:26.054 --> 21:29.093
- What?
- On the envelope. "CH"?

21:29.310 --> 21:31.852
What you wrote was really sexy.

21:32.025 --> 21:34.019
- Did you mean it?
- Yeah, sure.

21:34.194 --> 21:37.035
Well, then my answer is yes. I will.

21:45.970 --> 21:47.383
Everything okay?

21:47.598 --> 21:49.761
Well, we just got some labs back.

21:51.148 --> 21:54.236
Rodney's crit is okay.
But his platelets are falling.

21:54.571 --> 21:57.411
We're concerned that his blood
might not clot properly.

21:57.789 --> 21:59.496
Is he gonna pull through?

21:59.707 --> 22:01.120
Well, he...

22:01.336 --> 22:05.423
He may need to have a transfusion. But
don't worry. I'll keep an eye on him.

22:06.473 --> 22:08.016
Thanks, Peter.

22:08.184 --> 22:10.262
I know you're doing
everything you can, man.

22:10.438 --> 22:13.194
All the doctors have been in,
making sure he's all right.

22:16.202 --> 22:20.418
Isaac, are you aware that Rodney
has a rare genetic syndrome...

22:20.628 --> 22:23.122
...that caused his abdominal organs
to be reversed?

22:23.967 --> 22:25.214
Is that why he's so sick?

22:25.429 --> 22:29.016
No. But when he was hit by the car,
his liver was severely injured.

22:29.186 --> 22:30.219
See...

22:30.733 --> 22:34.070
If it had been in the proper position,
the prognosis might be better.

22:40.210 --> 22:41.587
Listen, I...

22:42.048 --> 22:46.095
I know it's not easy at times
like this to ask, but...

22:48.603 --> 22:51.941
...we'd like permission to draw
some of Rodney's blood...

22:52.111 --> 22:55.030
...along with yours and your ex-wife's
to do a genetic study.

22:55.241 --> 22:57.071
Yeah, okay.

22:57.873 --> 23:01.128
I'll do anything if it'll
help Rodney get better.

23:04.639 --> 23:07.213
Here. You need to sign the consent.

23:18.787 --> 23:23.700
On a scale of one to 10,
how would you rate your pain?

23:24.087 --> 23:25.583
Oh, I don't know.

23:25.799 --> 23:28.966
When you push like that,
it's a nine or an eight.

23:29.179 --> 23:31.966
But it could be a six or a seven.
I'm not sure.

23:32.642 --> 23:35.216
Ask him to describe
the quality of the pain.

23:37.065 --> 23:40.731
Mr. Kottmeier, please describe
the quality of your pain.

23:40.904 --> 23:41.938
Quality?

23:42.157 --> 23:44.944
Is it dull? Is it sharp?
Is it crampy? Is it constant?

23:45.161 --> 23:49.077
It's crampy, all right.
But sometimes it's sharp too.

23:49.459 --> 23:52.378
When it's not dull. I'm not sure.

23:52.547 --> 23:54.457
I'm a double Libra.
You know how that is.

23:54.676 --> 23:56.967
Not that I believe in horoscopes.

23:57.223 --> 23:59.015
That appears sharp to me.

23:59.225 --> 24:02.262
We're dealing with diverticulitis.
What do you wanna do?

24:03.273 --> 24:06.857
Well, that could be surgical or not.

24:07.320 --> 24:11.653
Order an abdominal ultrasound
or maybe get a CT. I'm not sure.

24:11.869 --> 24:14.492
Why don't we just start
with a history and a physical?

24:18.088 --> 24:20.496
Can you write me a scrip
for erythromycin ointment?

24:20.675 --> 24:22.669
I got a kid with conjunctivitis.

24:22.845 --> 24:25.336
Having you here today has been
a saving grace to me.

24:25.557 --> 24:26.756
Thanks.

24:27.227 --> 24:29.979
You worked hard to get this
going. I wish I had your guts.

24:30.188 --> 24:32.063
You gotta fight
for what you believe in.

24:32.234 --> 24:34.477
What if you don't have
the ammunition?

24:34.696 --> 24:35.895
Look for it.

24:41.080 --> 24:43.289
- That won't hurt him, will it?
- No.

24:49.094 --> 24:52.380
Give me 5 units of platelets and FFP.
500 units of heparin! Move!

24:52.600 --> 24:55.007
- Peter, what's wrong?
- His blood's not clotting.

24:55.227 --> 24:57.721
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God!

24:58.318 --> 25:01.271
He went into DIC.
I'm bolusing 500 of heparin.

25:02.740 --> 25:04.364
He's bradycardic.

25:04.783 --> 25:07.193
Lungs are wet.
Put him on 100% oxygen.

25:07.414 --> 25:08.493
His stats are falling!

25:08.665 --> 25:10.955
- Pulmonary hemorrhage.
- Get him on his stomach.

25:11.128 --> 25:12.670
Here we go, people. On my count.

25:12.879 --> 25:14.755
One, two, three!

25:14.925 --> 25:15.957
What's happening here?

25:16.136 --> 25:17.843
His lungs are filling with blood.

25:18.053 --> 25:20.892
- Jesus, please.
- Isaac, you gotta stand back.

25:21.102 --> 25:22.644
You've gotta stand back, man.

25:22.812 --> 25:23.844
Please.

25:24.983 --> 25:28.151
He's in asystole! Amp of epi!
We gotta get him turned back over.

25:28.362 --> 25:32.444
Here we go. On my count.
One, two, three, move!

25:32.828 --> 25:34.536
Gotta start CPR.

25:39.170 --> 25:41.841
- Connie, have you seen Cynthia?
- She's on a break.

25:42.009 --> 25:45.094
- Do you know if she left her purse?
- I don't know.

25:46.348 --> 25:47.678
She really likes you.

25:47.852 --> 25:49.429
Oh, yeah. We're just having fun.

25:49.603 --> 25:52.311
You gave her a diamond.
That's serious fun.

25:55.488 --> 25:56.519
What are you doing?

25:56.697 --> 25:59.237
- Nothing. I just lost my pen.
- Here.

25:59.452 --> 26:02.074
- You sign off on the budget?
- I found an error.

26:02.832 --> 26:03.863
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:04.084 --> 26:07.869
Here it has your salary
500 dollars more a week than mine.

26:08.089 --> 26:11.591
That's remuneration for my
taking over administrative duties...

26:11.804 --> 26:14.214
...until Morgenstern returns,
God willing.

26:14.435 --> 26:15.596
$25,000 a year?

26:15.809 --> 26:19.561
You signed off on this three months ago.
Why didn't you say something?

26:19.733 --> 26:21.941
I guess I just wasn't paying attention.

26:24.908 --> 26:27.780
Hey, Jeanie, have you seen
a chart for Kottmeier?

26:27.996 --> 26:31.165
- No.
- Guess I'll start a new one.

26:32.878 --> 26:36.581
And have you traveled
anywhere recently?

26:36.801 --> 26:39.174
I just did.
Louisville, to visit the in-laws.

26:39.388 --> 26:41.383
And then to...

26:41.601 --> 26:44.437
Time to wrap up. History
and physical just took 90 minutes.

26:44.605 --> 26:47.643
Shave an hour off, you'd be
in passing range for this clerkship.

26:47.819 --> 26:50.357
There's a rectal abscess in 2
with your name on it.

26:50.530 --> 26:52.608
Mr. Kottmeier,
someone will see you shortly.

26:52.827 --> 26:56.161
- It would've gone faster if my allergies-
- Take an antihistamine.

26:58.752 --> 27:00.128
Hi, Mr. Kottmeier.

27:00.296 --> 27:03.050
I'm Dr. Del Amico.
I'm gonna examine you.

27:03.260 --> 27:06.012
Boy, when they said shortly,
they mean shortly!

27:06.220 --> 27:09.177
This new clinic's a godsend.
I work part-time. No benefits.

27:09.393 --> 27:10.937
So thank you.

27:11.146 --> 27:13.603
No. Thank you for saying that.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.729
There you go, Hector.

27:16.071 --> 27:18.563
That shot will keep you
from getting sick.

27:18.783 --> 27:21.537
If it's not too much trouble,
could you look at his chin?

27:21.745 --> 27:24.202
He crabs about it,
but I don't see anything wrong.

27:24.376 --> 27:25.453
Sure.

27:26.170 --> 27:28.626
Okay, Hector.
Does it hurt when I do this?

27:28.842 --> 27:30.216
I can't feel it.

27:31.635 --> 27:34.009
- You don't feel me pressing on it?
- No.

27:34.183 --> 27:35.214
No?

27:35.683 --> 27:38.438
Okay, I'm gonna go see
if I can find a doctor.

27:40.274 --> 27:44.143
High-dose epi! Seven cc's, one to
a thousand! Another mg of atropine!

27:44.364 --> 27:45.444
We got a blip!

27:45.656 --> 27:47.283
- Was it a pulse?
- No pulse.

27:47.451 --> 27:50.574
Maybe he's got fluid around the heart.
Pericardiocentesis needle.

27:51.750 --> 27:54.918
Flatline. An epi can cause
a few transient heartbeats.

27:56.424 --> 27:57.706
Damn! No blood.

27:57.928 --> 28:01.678
All right. Epi drip wide open
and more platelets. Let's go!

28:02.684 --> 28:04.060
Peter, it's been 20 minutes.

28:04.895 --> 28:05.928
Peter!

28:11.613 --> 28:12.646
Peter.

28:33.439 --> 28:35.350
Time of death, 4:52.

28:57.226 --> 29:01.143
Get him up to CT. Keep the C-collar on
until Radiology clears the C-spine.

29:01.358 --> 29:03.896
- You want films?
- No. The neurosurgeon will take them.

29:04.071 --> 29:07.820
- Kerry, I'd like a minute with you.
- Sure. Jeanie, what is it?

29:08.034 --> 29:09.825
I wanna take a look at the budget.

29:10.246 --> 29:12.324
- The ER budget?
- That's right. Yeah.

29:12.542 --> 29:14.702
I've told you.
It's nothing personal.

29:14.919 --> 29:18.836
I tried everything to try and keep you
here. The numbers don't support it.

29:19.009 --> 29:21.301
If I'm being fired,
I wanna see the numbers...

29:21.473 --> 29:23.428
...not hear your interpretation of them.

29:23.598 --> 29:25.975
I've gone over them
with a fine-tooth comb.

29:26.147 --> 29:28.020
It's not fair,
but that's the way it is.

29:28.190 --> 29:30.185
How do you justify
hiring a new nurse?

29:30.359 --> 29:33.947
Yosh Takata was hired to replace
two nurses who've left.

29:34.826 --> 29:36.535
What about giving yourself a raise?

29:37.496 --> 29:39.040
Salaries are confidential.

29:40.127 --> 29:41.289
I sure as hell know why.

29:45.218 --> 29:48.718
- Jeanie, I'm sorry I can't help you.
- I'll find someone who can.

29:49.557 --> 29:50.588
Hey, Carter.

29:50.767 --> 29:53.853
Have you had a patient complain
about his chin falling asleep?

29:54.063 --> 29:55.476
Heads up, Henry. No.

29:55.651 --> 29:57.808
I'm sure if it's contagious,
he'll catch it.

29:57.985 --> 30:00.777
- Where are you going?
- Mr. Kottmeier's my patient.

30:00.951 --> 30:02.779
Then why did I do a physical on him?

30:02.954 --> 30:04.576
I'm quite fond of all of you.

30:04.745 --> 30:07.502
You did remember to sign him out
on the board, didn't you?

30:07.712 --> 30:10.083
- Was I supposed to?
- Where are you taking him?

30:10.256 --> 30:14.126
To the surgical ward. Mr. Kottmeier
has an inflamed diverticulum...

30:14.346 --> 30:17.597
...that perfed into his mesentery.
He needs a colectomy.

30:17.808 --> 30:20.301
Hold on. Have you
considered medical management?

30:20.521 --> 30:24.474
Treat the abscess with a course of Flagyl
and Cipro before jumping into surgery?

30:24.694 --> 30:27.366
- I'm willing to give it a shot.
- No, no, no, wait.

30:27.576 --> 30:29.901
Do you agree because
you think I wanna hear that?

30:30.079 --> 30:31.820
Or do you really believe that?

30:32.039 --> 30:33.071
What?

30:33.751 --> 30:36.289
I don't want you agreeing with me
just to please me.

30:36.506 --> 30:39.839
I'm not. I've already considered
several alternatives to surgery.

30:40.009 --> 30:41.292
- You have?
- Shut up, Henry!

30:43.433 --> 30:44.464
Mark.

30:44.852 --> 30:47.223
If you have a problem
with my salary, come to me.

30:47.396 --> 30:48.976
Don't bring it up with the staff.

30:49.191 --> 30:51.897
Do you have any idea how many
hours I work every week?

30:52.070 --> 30:53.350
What are you talking about?

30:53.530 --> 30:56.652
- You disclosed our salaries to Jeanie.
- No, I didn't.

30:56.869 --> 30:58.447
- You didn't?
- No.

30:59.249 --> 31:01.575
What happened to all
the patients in your clinic?

31:01.753 --> 31:04.589
I gave them meal tickets and
stashed them in the cafeteria.

31:04.756 --> 31:06.168
Stressful day for you, huh?

31:06.382 --> 31:09.257
- Tell me about it.
- Anything interesting in Doug's note?

31:09.473 --> 31:10.553
I wish I knew.

31:10.726 --> 31:13.298
- I lost it before I got to read it.
- That's too bad.

31:13.518 --> 31:15.930
- How are you on Medline searches?
- Why?

31:16.150 --> 31:19.152
I did one on submandibular
paralysis and I came up with zilch.

31:19.363 --> 31:21.689
I'm not surprised.
I've never heard of it.

31:22.032 --> 31:25.284
I've got this kid complaining
of a numb chin. What should I do?

31:25.496 --> 31:27.289
Why don't you try "numb chin"?

31:28.875 --> 31:30.504
"Numb chin. "

31:31.215 --> 31:34.131
That sounds a little too,
you know, easy.

31:34.678 --> 31:36.174
Hey.

31:36.848 --> 31:38.557
There you go.

31:40.312 --> 31:41.640
I'm sorry, Isaac.

31:45.570 --> 31:47.445
Can we have a word with you
in the hall?

31:48.700 --> 31:50.243
I don't wanna leave my boy.

31:52.414 --> 31:54.822
We'd like your permission
to perform an autopsy.

31:55.835 --> 31:57.082
Why?

31:57.589 --> 31:59.463
Well, because it could be useful.

32:00.301 --> 32:01.760
Did something go wrong?

32:01.929 --> 32:03.754
He started bleeding when
you stuck him.

32:03.973 --> 32:06.811
No. His blood wouldn't clot
because of the liver injury.

32:07.020 --> 32:10.557
- Then why do you need to do an autopsy?
- For research.

32:11.152 --> 32:12.612
It could be helpful.

32:14.531 --> 32:17.284
That's why you're so interested.
Not because he was hurt.

32:17.453 --> 32:19.695
No, no, no.
We were trying to save his life.

32:19.915 --> 32:23.165
When you took his blood and mine,
were you trying to save his life?

32:23.376 --> 32:25.171
- No-
- We'd like to study his condition.

32:25.381 --> 32:26.628
I don't want him studied.

32:26.801 --> 32:28.046
We understand how you-

32:28.220 --> 32:32.301
Look at him! Don't you think
you cut him up enough?

32:32.517 --> 32:34.059
- Isaac, I'm so sorry.
- No!

32:34.269 --> 32:36.808
I don't want you cutting up my son!

32:41.699 --> 32:43.858
You're right. I'm sorry.

32:47.124 --> 32:48.500
I'll leave you alone.

33:05.358 --> 33:07.567
Focus, Henry. What do you hear?

33:11.536 --> 33:13.530
- I'm not- I'm not sure.
- What do you hear?

33:13.748 --> 33:16.240
He has a pneumothorax.
We'll put in a chest tube.

33:16.460 --> 33:17.540
I'll grab a tray.

33:17.753 --> 33:20.376
- It hurts.
- Yeah. I bet it hurts.

33:20.592 --> 33:23.629
Hang on there. Everything will
feel better in a minute.

33:24.931 --> 33:28.766
Okay. Henry, the first thing that
you wanna do is feel for the ribs...

33:28.938 --> 33:31.941
...along the midaxillary line
locating the fifth interspace.

33:32.150 --> 33:33.694
Can I get some Betadine?

33:34.947 --> 33:36.858
Where you make the incision.

33:37.076 --> 33:39.614
- I'm not feeling so good.
- What?

33:40.582 --> 33:41.780
I'm not feeling so good.

33:42.001 --> 33:44.458
Sit down.
Put your head between your knees.

33:44.630 --> 33:46.122
Lily, give me the Kelly.

33:48.803 --> 33:50.463
How are you doing, Henry?

33:52.056 --> 33:54.726
Lydia, do me a favor and
slide Henry out of the way.

33:55.521 --> 33:58.144
- Carter, he's a little cyanotic.
- What?

33:59.443 --> 34:00.987
Can't get a pulse on the banger!

34:01.154 --> 34:02.983
Lydia, call an Attending!

34:03.700 --> 34:07.402
Change the dressing twice a day. Think
twice before defending any skydivers.

34:07.622 --> 34:08.735
Thank you, doc.

34:08.956 --> 34:10.286
We need you in Trauma 1.

34:10.502 --> 34:12.579
Anna, Malik, we may need your help.

34:17.553 --> 34:19.715
- What happened?
- Banger had a tension pneumo.

34:19.891 --> 34:22.643
- Henry passed out.
- All right. I'll finish the chest tube.

34:22.853 --> 34:24.350
Get your student into Trauma 2.

34:24.565 --> 34:27.235
Okay. Henry, you're gonna be
just fine.

34:27.402 --> 34:28.647
Everybody grab hold.

34:28.862 --> 34:31.274
On my count. One, two, three.

34:31.828 --> 34:33.237
- What happened?
- I don't know.

34:33.454 --> 34:36.077
I showed him how to put in
a chest tube and he fainted.

34:36.248 --> 34:39.371
- Go on the other side.
- Wheezes bilaterally.

34:39.589 --> 34:40.619
Pulse ox is 86.

34:40.839 --> 34:43.047
I need to intubate.
Get me a laryngoscope.

34:43.261 --> 34:45.420
- Let's go!
- Did he complain of feeling sick?

34:45.598 --> 34:47.344
He always does.
He's a hypochondriac.

34:47.518 --> 34:49.510
- Is he on any meds?
- Not that I know of.

34:49.728 --> 34:53.146
Okay. Let's get a CBC, Chem-20,
and a tox screen.

34:53.985 --> 34:55.016
All right, I'm in.

34:55.235 --> 34:57.778
- Bag him.
- Pulse ox is worse. Down to 82.

34:57.993 --> 34:59.570
What? Get a blood gas.

34:59.785 --> 35:02.909
- Pressure's crashing!
- What the hell is going on?

35:03.332 --> 35:05.827
His wrist and his left hand
are red and edematous.

35:06.047 --> 35:07.422
Right hand's also swollen.

35:07.631 --> 35:10.882
Oh, my God!
He's allergic to latex. Okay.

35:11.094 --> 35:14.302
He's in asystole!
Amp of epi, IV push!

35:14.476 --> 35:16.849
ET tube cup has latex.
We've got to extubate.

35:17.063 --> 35:19.521
Lily, get me an ET tube
from the latex-free cart.

35:19.734 --> 35:20.766
Wash your hands first.

35:20.987 --> 35:23.026
Chuny, get me a basin of water.

35:23.239 --> 35:27.322
- Found a non-latex ET tube.
- A mg of atropine and 50 of Benadryl!

35:28.415 --> 35:30.821
Laryngeal edema.
I'm having a hard time getting in.

35:31.041 --> 35:33.287
- How long has he been down?
-30 seconds.

35:33.506 --> 35:36.258
- Watch his teeth. Can you see the cords?
- I know. Barely.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.925
All right, Malik. Hi-dose epi.
Seven cc's.

35:39.138 --> 35:43.090
You're doing great.
Just keep sliding it in very gently.

35:44.270 --> 35:45.814
- I'm in.
- Great.

35:46.023 --> 35:47.188
Good job.

35:47.361 --> 35:48.736
Got a pulse.

35:49.112 --> 35:50.144
Everything okay here?

35:50.364 --> 35:52.025
Everything's under control.

35:54.622 --> 35:56.281
Peter, I'd like to speak to you.

35:56.499 --> 35:58.707
I'd like to speak to you as well.

36:01.965 --> 36:05.382
I've been reconsidering the possibility
of joining your team.

36:08.852 --> 36:12.102
I understand Mr. Price refused
an autopsy on his son.

36:12.272 --> 36:13.767
Did you try to convince him?

36:13.983 --> 36:15.978
He doesn't want us carving his boy.

36:16.154 --> 36:18.562
Did you explain how research
might benefit others?

36:18.741 --> 36:20.153
He doesn't want it.

36:20.368 --> 36:22.493
Give him some time. He's emotional.

36:24.375 --> 36:26.084
I don't feel comfortable doing that.

36:29.718 --> 36:33.383
How do you think we made advances
in heart surgery, in transplantation?

36:33.597 --> 36:36.601
By refining procedures on patients
and studying the results.

36:37.479 --> 36:41.265
That kid was a freak of nature. And we
have a responsibility to do research.

36:41.443 --> 36:43.520
That "freak" was a boy
named Rodney Price...

36:43.697 --> 36:46.106
...whose father doesn't understand
why he lost him.

36:46.283 --> 36:49.205
All you want to do is cut him
despite his father's wishes.

36:50.290 --> 36:51.666
We're scientists, Peter.

36:52.919 --> 36:57.502
We're not allowed sentimentality.
Now, you go back and get consent.

36:57.720 --> 37:01.220
- Because I want it.
- No. You get somebody else to do it.

37:03.853 --> 37:07.058
I just got a lab report back on
one of my patients, a 7-year-old.

37:07.274 --> 37:09.648
Turns out he's got
acute lymphocytic leukemia.

37:09.820 --> 37:11.531
A doctor should speak to the mother.

37:11.699 --> 37:14.237
- How did it present?
- Kid's complaint was a numb chin.

37:14.411 --> 37:16.404
I checked in the computer,
ran some tests.

37:16.581 --> 37:18.077
The mom knows you. Talk to her.

37:18.293 --> 37:20.617
Call me if she has any questions.

37:22.714 --> 37:25.634
And then I plea-bargained her down
to a misdemeanor...

37:25.845 --> 37:28.383
...not two weeks after
she shot a guy!

37:29.517 --> 37:33.137
You could've saved yourself a whole
bunch of urgent phone messages...

37:33.315 --> 37:35.143
...if you'd told me Herb was on board.

37:35.319 --> 37:37.312
- I didn't know you knew each other.
- Yeah.

37:37.487 --> 37:39.945
I served on the Trial Lawyers'
Banquet Committee.

37:40.118 --> 37:41.196
Herb was our speaker.

37:41.369 --> 37:43.694
I've been filling him in
on that Law family suit.

37:43.872 --> 37:45.666
You got yourself
quite a little mess.

37:45.877 --> 37:47.999
I've decided to ignore
the whole thing.

37:48.212 --> 37:50.884
Oh, wrong impulse.
You'll get slaughtered.

37:51.052 --> 37:54.716
You had better file this right
away to avoid a summary judgment.

37:54.931 --> 37:58.183
Mark, the hospital's board of
directors is gonna be very relieved...

37:58.395 --> 38:01.066
...to hear that you have
such excellent representation.

38:01.274 --> 38:05.523
You know, you came about
this close to losing your job.

38:06.116 --> 38:09.901
Herb, if you have any questions
at all, please just give me a call.

38:10.080 --> 38:11.110
I shall. I shall.

38:11.289 --> 38:14.045
- Take care of yourself, Alan.
- You too. Mark.

38:15.796 --> 38:18.504
Why did you let Alan believe
that you're representing me?

38:18.718 --> 38:22.669
Honestly, doc, he's a lousy lawyer.
He jumps to conclusions.

38:22.891 --> 38:25.265
Nevertheless, I could represent you.

38:25.438 --> 38:27.764
Your fee would be a little
too steep for me.

38:27.940 --> 38:30.693
400 an hour with
$10,000 retainer fee.

38:30.903 --> 38:34.110
- I figured.
- But, honestly, I don't need the money.

38:34.577 --> 38:35.609
I'm bored.

38:35.787 --> 38:37.530
I'm looking for new challenges.

38:37.747 --> 38:39.077
Here's the deal.

38:39.292 --> 38:40.324
Let me shadow you.

38:40.837 --> 38:42.829
You throw in a few procedures.
Nothing big.

38:43.047 --> 38:45.421
Maybe a couple of stitches
here and there.

38:45.635 --> 38:50.465
And I'll make your little lawsuit
vanish just like that. Gratis.

38:56.111 --> 38:58.399
I got an autopsy consent
on the Price boy.

38:58.614 --> 39:00.939
The father just needed more time.

39:01.535 --> 39:03.280
Why didn't Rocket send you?

39:03.496 --> 39:04.610
I refused.

39:04.831 --> 39:06.028
That was a ballsy move.

39:06.251 --> 39:08.291
It wasn't a move.
I told him what I felt.

39:08.503 --> 39:11.506
Well, it worked. Take a look
at tomorrow's surgery schedule.

39:11.717 --> 39:15.220
You're scrubbing in on a lap
splenectomy at 7 a. m.

39:15.765 --> 39:17.223
Rocket's team.

39:17.433 --> 39:19.973
He's partial to residents
with backbone.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.311
John?

39:26.530 --> 39:28.074
Yes, Henry?

39:29.370 --> 39:30.403
What happened?

39:30.580 --> 39:33.701
You went into anaphylactic shock
from latex.

39:34.210 --> 39:35.954
I was near death.

39:36.172 --> 39:38.877
- Yes.
- And you were there.

39:39.093 --> 39:40.802
Yes, Henry. I was there.

39:41.221 --> 39:43.214
And so was Anna.

39:45.812 --> 39:48.054
It was like a dream.

39:48.564 --> 39:49.894
Anna!

39:50.903 --> 39:52.564
Hey, Henry.

39:53.780 --> 39:56.869
It was the most amazing thing.

39:58.413 --> 40:01.832
I remember being drawn...

40:02.044 --> 40:04.965
...toward this bright light.

40:05.175 --> 40:08.260
And then suddenly I was floating...

40:08.430 --> 40:10.839
...up above you...

40:12.270 --> 40:15.141
...over there in the corner...

40:17.988 --> 40:21.653
...watching as the two of you...

40:22.619 --> 40:26.488
...enveloped in a blue glow...

40:27.626 --> 40:31.793
...worked together, united...

40:33.094 --> 40:35.086
...to save my life.

40:37.640 --> 40:39.434
Thank you, John.

40:40.104 --> 40:41.847
Thank you, Anna.

40:44.152 --> 40:46.111
You are my angels.

40:47.280 --> 40:49.524
You brought me back to the living.

40:57.673 --> 40:58.834
Good night.

40:59.175 --> 41:00.290
Good night.

41:00.802 --> 41:02.842
Can't be a chart you're writing.

41:03.305 --> 41:04.338
No.

41:04.517 --> 41:06.761
And from the way
you're covering it up...

41:06.978 --> 41:08.723
...I'd say it's something personal.

41:08.940 --> 41:10.849
Yeah. It's a...

41:11.526 --> 41:12.559
It's a love letter.

41:14.781 --> 41:17.489
The sentimental kind...

41:17.704 --> 41:20.410
...or the "I'd like to
rip your pants off" kind?

41:22.002 --> 41:23.377
Definitely the latter.

41:24.632 --> 41:26.755
I'd like to be writing one of those.

41:26.926 --> 41:28.255
Pity I broke up with Jeremy.

41:28.430 --> 41:32.262
- Could've been more fun, long-distance.
- Someone from home?

41:32.518 --> 41:34.762
A self-possessed dermatologist.

41:35.106 --> 41:37.264
I'm afraid I broke his heart.

41:38.277 --> 41:39.688
Well, it's 9:00.

41:39.904 --> 41:43.109
And since you're writing rather
than living out your prose...

41:43.326 --> 41:46.911
- ... I'd venture to say you're alone.
- Yeah.

41:48.166 --> 41:49.449
Fancy grabbing a drink?

41:50.713 --> 41:52.171
I would love to.

41:55.304 --> 41:57.712
It is an unenviable job
running the ER...

41:57.890 --> 42:00.347
...and making difficult
cost-cutting decisions.

42:00.520 --> 42:01.550
I got your message.

42:02.063 --> 42:06.195
Jeanie came in quite upset
about the budget.

42:06.405 --> 42:08.561
And I was just explaining that...

42:08.780 --> 42:11.571
...it appears that you treated her
honestly and fairly.

42:11.787 --> 42:14.076
She gave herself a $25,000 raise.

42:14.248 --> 42:16.125
That's from the administrative budget.

42:16.337 --> 42:19.337
I understand that's your story.
But I don't buy it.

42:19.548 --> 42:20.924
Something else is going on.

42:22.595 --> 42:23.841
And what would that be?

42:24.639 --> 42:25.754
My HIV status.

42:25.974 --> 42:27.057
Jeanie!

42:27.685 --> 42:29.514
I believe that's why I'm being fired.

42:33.654 --> 42:34.684
I see.

42:36.783 --> 42:37.982
Well...

42:38.952 --> 42:40.330
Let's not do anything rash.

42:41.666 --> 42:44.290
I am late for a dinner at the moment.

42:44.463 --> 42:47.464
But tomorrow I can give the budget...

42:47.675 --> 42:49.469
...another more thorough review.

42:49.638 --> 42:51.713
We've been over these figures
a dozen times.

42:51.931 --> 42:53.890
You told me we had to cut P.A.s.

42:55.312 --> 42:58.814
Why don't you give Kerry and me
another day to recheck our figures?

42:58.984 --> 43:01.192
Thank you, Dr. Anspaugh. I will.

43:07.998 --> 43:11.835
Jeanie, you're really gonna use
your HIV status like this?

43:12.048 --> 43:13.458
I call it as I see it.

43:13.674 --> 43:15.466
I tried everything to keep you here.

43:15.676 --> 43:18.514
Then I bent over backwards
to help you get a job in Atlanta.

43:18.724 --> 43:20.348
It just isn't fair, is it?

43:20.560 --> 43:23.681
I've never discriminated against
you because of your HIV status.

43:23.897 --> 43:25.644
I fought to keep you here.

43:25.860 --> 43:28.529
Kerry, like you said before,
it's nothing personal.

43:32.703 --> 43:37.782
- To your health!
- Thank you.

43:51.689 --> 43:52.724
Here.

43:52.943 --> 43:55.814
- What have we here?
- What have we here?

43:56.030 --> 43:57.775
Another present?

43:58.868 --> 44:02.155
It's beautiful. Should I try it on?

44:02.373 --> 44:04.202
You can try it on later.

44:10.928 --> 44:14.882
I dream of the taste of your neck and
the smell of your hair on my pillow.

44:15.103 --> 44:16.301
You do?

44:17.480 --> 44:19.605
No, silly. You do.

44:19.776 --> 44:21.816
Did you mean everything
you wrote?

44:22.028 --> 44:24.438
Yeah. Yeah, I did. It was...

44:24.617 --> 44:26.242
I was homesick.

44:29.624 --> 44:32.960
Do you remember this afternoon
when I said that I will?

44:33.171 --> 44:34.714
I changed my mind. I won't.

44:34.924 --> 44:36.040
You won't?

44:38.680 --> 44:41.802
Not unless you go first. Lie back.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
