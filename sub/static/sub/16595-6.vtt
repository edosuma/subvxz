00:03.971 --> 00:05.337
(both laugh)

00:05.339 --> 00:07.206
Okay, Kris, I got everything
in here you need

00:07.208 --> 00:08.540
to fix that drain.

00:08.542 --> 00:10.142
All right,
got a pipe wrench,

00:10.144 --> 00:12.144
I got a basin wrench,
some Teflon tape.

00:12.146 --> 00:14.279
Now, Ryan's fixing it, right?
Yep.

00:14.281 --> 00:17.116
And I got the plumber's number
in there, too.

00:17.118 --> 00:18.350
Thank you, Dad.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.785
I had no idea
owning a home

00:19.787 --> 00:21.987
meant you spend
all of your time fixing it.

00:21.989 --> 00:24.390
Yeah,
but once it's all fixed --

00:24.392 --> 00:25.724
Well, we'll let you know.

00:27.395 --> 00:29.028
You know, we have been here
20 years,

00:29.030 --> 00:30.329
and your father
still hasn't

00:30.331 --> 00:31.530
gotten the
squirrels out of the attic.

00:31.532 --> 00:32.965
Yeah, I'd love
to get the squirrels

00:32.967 --> 00:34.466
out of<i> your</i> attic.
Hey.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.235
(laughs)

00:36.237 --> 00:38.370
Honey, you can stay for dinner.
We're just waiting on Eve.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.139
Oh, uh, where'd you have her
working today?

00:40.141 --> 00:41.974
Yesterday, she was
on the loading dock, Mom.

00:41.976 --> 00:43.976
Yeah. What? Mike,
isn't that dangerous?

00:43.978 --> 00:45.210
For Eve? Are you kidding?
She's like an ant.

00:45.212 --> 00:46.845
She can lift
50 times her weight.

00:46.847 --> 00:49.715
Eve's worked in just about
every department by now, huh?

00:49.717 --> 00:51.683
Yeah. She got Accounting,
Fish and Tackle.

00:51.685 --> 00:53.819
She even took over
the crossbow safety course.

00:53.821 --> 00:55.554
Oh, yeah, that's right.
How is Earl?

00:55.556 --> 00:57.256
Earl --
just a flesh wound.

00:57.258 --> 00:59.758
I don't think he'll
be drinking beer at lunch again.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.326
Better watch out, Dad.

01:01.328 --> 01:03.328
One day,
Eve might take<i> your</i> job.

01:03.330 --> 01:06.331
Well, she's already got Earl
out of the way.

01:06.333 --> 01:08.233
You know, I am so glad
that Eve is making good use

01:08.235 --> 01:09.868
of her gap year.

01:09.870 --> 01:11.937
I mean, between playing music
at the coffee house

01:11.939 --> 01:13.272
and working with you,

01:13.274 --> 01:14.573
she'll head off to college
next year

01:14.575 --> 01:15.908
with some good
life experience.

01:15.910 --> 01:17.342
Yeah.

01:17.344 --> 01:19.678
She'll have a year
working 10 different jobs

01:19.680 --> 01:23.515
before she gets brainwashed
by people who've never had<i> one.</i>

01:23.517 --> 01:26.018
Hey, honey. I'm home.

01:26.020 --> 01:28.253
Hey, how was work?

01:28.255 --> 01:29.588
Ugh, can I get a martini

01:29.590 --> 01:31.924
and read the paper
before the yackity-yack?

01:33.227 --> 01:36.695
Sorry, I watched a black-
and-white movie last night.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.864
Where were you working today?
Online sales. How was that?

01:38.866 --> 01:39.865
Yeah. It was great.

01:39.867 --> 01:41.066
Everyone was super-friendly

01:41.068 --> 01:42.568
and totally supportive

01:42.570 --> 01:44.870
when I told them I was gonna quit.
(chuckles)

01:44.872 --> 01:47.306
Oh, by the way,
I'm quitting.

01:48.476 --> 01:49.975
Sorry.
I didn't hear you

01:49.977 --> 01:52.878
with all the squirrels
running around in the attic.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.948
-- Captions by VITAC --

01:59.720 --> 02:02.821
You want to quit working
at Outdoor Man?

02:02.823 --> 02:04.623
No. I<i> am</i> quitting.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.626
You made it "want to quit"
so we can have this discussion.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.161
This is crazy.

02:09.163 --> 02:11.163
You're making good money.
It's a great experience.

02:11.165 --> 02:12.664
You want to cop
a few fishing lures,

02:15.136 --> 02:16.302
I'll look
the other way.

02:16.303 --> 02:17.469
You know, one of the best parts
about being the oldest kid

02:17.471 --> 02:18.837
is that you know
the exact moment

02:18.839 --> 02:20.672
your parents are about
to explode.

02:20.674 --> 02:22.708
My thoughts and prayers
are with you.

02:24.578 --> 02:27.279
Uh, honey,
w-why are you quitting?

02:27.281 --> 02:28.747
No, no, no.
She<i> wants</i> to quit.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.149
She's considering it.
It's not -- not a done deal.

02:30.151 --> 02:31.517
I found something else
I want to do.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.185
You have another offer?
I'll -- I'll match it.

02:33.187 --> 02:35.521
I'm gonna volunteer
at Take Shelter Denver.

02:35.523 --> 02:37.322
They build houses
for the homeless.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.424
You volunteer, you're making
nothing. I'll double<i> that.</i>

02:40.928 --> 02:42.661
I think it's wonderful
that Eve wants to volunteer.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.763
I mean, I used to read to the blind...
No. No.

02:44.765 --> 02:49.601
but they didn't like it (low voice)
when I used to do the voices.

02:49.603 --> 02:52.271
The only volunteer I know
that was fired.

02:53.374 --> 02:55.007
What are you gonna use
for money?

02:55.009 --> 02:56.508
They don't pay you
at the coffee shop for singing,

02:56.510 --> 02:57.709
so you're already working
for nothing there.

02:57.711 --> 02:59.278
I still have
graduation money.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.612
Oh, perfect.
That's one week.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.181
What do you do
for money next week?

03:02.183 --> 03:03.382
I'll figure it out, Dad.

03:03.384 --> 03:04.950
It's not like I have a lot
of expenses.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.718
I mean, isn't that the
whole point of this gap year --

03:06.720 --> 03:08.187
to figure out how I fit
into the world?

03:08.189 --> 03:10.022
Fit into
the real world,

03:10.024 --> 03:13.325
which is about making money,
buying food, football.

03:13.327 --> 03:16.862
Dad, i-it's -- it's my life,
and it's my year,

03:16.864 --> 03:18.830
or maybe even longer,

03:18.832 --> 03:22.234
I don't know, but I-I will
figure that out, Dad.

03:23.470 --> 03:27.172
She wants to do charity.
How is that so bad?

03:27.174 --> 03:28.140
Did you hear that?
Yeah.

03:28.142 --> 03:29.675
"Maybe even longer."

03:29.677 --> 03:31.743
She's not going to college.
She quit her job.

03:31.745 --> 03:37.382
You know where this ends up?
Cardboard box under a bridge.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.251
Is that where you want
to say hello to your grandkids?

03:39.253 --> 03:41.186
Okay. You know, look,
I understand.

03:41.188 --> 03:42.854
You're upset
because you won't be taking

03:42.856 --> 03:44.489
your little buddy to work anymore.
Oh, stop.

03:44.491 --> 03:46.058
That has nothing to do
with it.

03:46.060 --> 03:47.559
I'm upset because Eve doesn't
know how the world works,

03:47.561 --> 03:49.494
but thank God
she's got an amazing father

03:49.496 --> 03:50.896
who cares enough
about her

03:50.898 --> 03:55.601
to give her a lovely, loving
kick in the ass.

03:55.603 --> 03:59.238
♪♪

03:59.240 --> 04:02.507
(sighs) Hey, thanks for spending
lunch with me, babe.

04:02.509 --> 04:04.376
Yeah.
Sorry I didn't talk more.

04:04.378 --> 04:05.944
It's just, you know,
you get me a crown

04:05.946 --> 04:08.447
and a kids' menu,
I'm all business.

04:10.217 --> 04:11.717
All right,
now, you scoot, young lady,

04:11.719 --> 04:13.352
so I can get to work
on your wedding gift.

04:13.354 --> 04:15.354
No. We already have
enough presents as is.

04:15.356 --> 04:17.222
We don't need to spend
any money on each other.

04:17.224 --> 04:18.590
And that's me talking.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.392
Well, I'm not spending
any money on your gift.

04:20.394 --> 04:21.960
Those are the best kind.

04:21.962 --> 04:26.798
Aww, but I already have
two jars of rain, Kyle.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.901
And two jars
of sunshine, yeah.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.036
But this is gonna be
even better.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.904
Just --
Just wait and see.

04:32.906 --> 04:36.942
All right, but, for the record,
I'm not getting you anything.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.613
Is she the best
or what?

04:41.615 --> 04:43.649
So, what exactly
are you giving the girl

04:43.651 --> 04:45.117
that doesn't cost
anything?

04:45.119 --> 04:47.052
Oh, a car.

04:47.054 --> 04:49.755
You're thinking
of a macaroni sculpture.

04:49.757 --> 04:52.924
A car is a big, metal thing
with an engine and seats.

04:52.926 --> 04:55.093
No,
I-I read this story online

04:55.095 --> 04:57.229
about this guy who traded
a paper clip for a pen,

04:57.231 --> 04:58.563
and then a pen
for a flute,

04:58.565 --> 05:00.132
and, you know,
he kept trading up,

05:00.134 --> 05:01.967
until he got a house.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.636
Yeah,
I-I read a similar story,

05:04.638 --> 05:08.140
but it had a cow
and a magic bag of beans.

05:10.444 --> 05:12.844
I'm gonna start by trading
this laser pointer

05:12.846 --> 05:15.414
I got with my subscription
to<i> Atlantic Monthly.</i>

05:15.416 --> 05:17.516
Oh, you read
<i> Atlantic Monthly?</i>

05:17.518 --> 05:20.852
Nope, I just wanted
this free pointer.

05:20.854 --> 05:24.189
Kyle, that -- that paper-clip
story isn't real.

05:24.191 --> 05:26.658
See, con artists put that kind
of stuff out there all the time

05:26.660 --> 05:29.094
to take advantage
of people like<i> you.</i>

05:29.096 --> 05:31.263
I disagree.
I think people are generous.

05:31.265 --> 05:33.932
You know, when I -- when I post
that I'm a newlywed,

05:33.934 --> 05:36.668
trying to get my bride a
wonderful gift... Mm-hmm.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.437
...I think you'll be
surprised.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.272
(chuckles)
I think you'll end up

05:40.274 --> 05:42.274
giving your bride
a laser pointer.

05:44.445 --> 05:47.379
I think it's a sweet idea, Kyle.
And you know what?

05:47.381 --> 05:49.014
To get you started,

05:49.016 --> 05:52.317
I'll trade you my old briefcase
for the laser pointer.

05:52.319 --> 05:54.686
(chuckling) Oh!
Deal.

05:54.688 --> 05:59.091
I always wanted to say that
holding a briefcase.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.527
Stop encouraging him
with this nonsense.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.963
A con man
will eat that kid for lunch.

06:04.965 --> 06:06.064
Ah, I don't think --

06:06.066 --> 06:07.632
Oh, shoot. My lunch.
Hey, Kyle!

06:08.469 --> 06:09.935
Kyle!

06:11.805 --> 06:13.672
Do you want
another pancake?

06:13.674 --> 06:14.706
Yeah. They're great.

06:14.708 --> 06:18.110
All right.
There you go.

06:19.847 --> 06:21.346
Dad, are we, uh --
are we cool?

06:21.348 --> 06:22.581
Sure.
Why wouldn't we be?

06:22.583 --> 06:24.182
Oh, okay, I just want you
to understand

06:24.184 --> 06:26.184
that doing charity
is really important to me,

06:26.186 --> 06:28.487
and Take Shelter Denver
is a really good organization.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.322
It's a
great organization.

06:30.324 --> 06:31.590
You know, your mom and I give
quite a bit of money to them.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.024
Oh, really?
That is so cool.

06:33.026 --> 06:34.426
Maybe I'll wind up
using a hammer

06:34.428 --> 06:36.862
you guys
bought or something.

06:36.864 --> 06:39.030
And wouldn't that be great?
Yeah.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.599
There you go.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.268
What's this?

06:43.270 --> 06:44.770
That's a bill
for what you had --

06:44.772 --> 06:46.805
pancakes, bacon,
and a venti coffee.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.442
Eight bucks.

06:50.444 --> 06:52.411
You're charging me
for breakfast?

06:52.413 --> 06:54.813
(sighs) And rent.

06:57.217 --> 07:00.619
Congratulations.
The hammer just came down.

07:09.863 --> 07:13.064
You're charging me rent
in my family home?

07:13.066 --> 07:14.733
That's insane, Dad.

07:14.735 --> 07:17.068
No. I'm charging you
way below market value.

07:17.070 --> 07:19.137
<i> That's</i> insane.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.539
But I'm your favorite,

07:20.541 --> 07:22.441
the one who goes
to the gun range with you

07:22.443 --> 07:23.642
and to the batting cages

07:23.644 --> 07:25.577
and to Ronald Reagan's
birthplace,

07:25.579 --> 07:28.680
where I was so moved,
I wept at age 6.

07:29.716 --> 07:31.283
And you're telling me
that's all worth nothing?

07:31.285 --> 07:33.051
Nothing?!

07:34.455 --> 07:36.388
I didn't charge you
for the juice.

07:37.491 --> 07:39.891
Listen, I just want you to know
how the world works, Eve.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.660
I know how it works, Dad.
No, you don't!

07:41.662 --> 07:43.094
I think you live
in a bubble.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.263
Not a real one, 'cause
that would be very fragile

07:45.265 --> 07:47.098
and offer
no real protection.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.434
So, are you charging me
for this lecture, too?

07:49.436 --> 07:51.303
'Cause I don't see it here
on the bill.

07:51.305 --> 07:53.104
This paradise you live in
is not real, all right?

07:53.106 --> 07:54.940
Unless you get that
through your head,

07:54.942 --> 07:56.975
Take Shelter Denver's gonna
be building<i> you</i> a house someday.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.644
Hmm. Better watch out. That
bacon's gonna cost you.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.146
Mm. Nah.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.348
I have the metabolism
of a snake.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.918
At least I think they have
a good metabolism.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.621
I mean,
they're, like, skinny.

08:09.623 --> 08:12.791
Get this -- Dad's charging
for food and rent.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.993
Yeah, but not you.
E-Everything's on the house.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.128
What? H-How come
you're not charging her?

08:17.130 --> 08:19.431
Because she's going to college,
and she's working.

08:19.433 --> 08:23.401
Oh, my God! Dad, that's
so unfair! You never -- Wait.

08:26.306 --> 08:30.075
Are you using me
as an example?

08:32.346 --> 08:35.280
Like, a good one?

08:36.483 --> 08:39.050
I know it's weird.
Just go with it.

08:39.052 --> 08:42.220
Okay, okay, So, right now,
at this very moment,

08:42.222 --> 08:45.056
I'm your favorite?

08:45.058 --> 08:49.394
Even though I never went
to Ronald McReagan's house?

08:54.334 --> 08:56.801
You're making this
very difficult.

08:56.803 --> 08:58.503
So, basically,
I'm being punished

10:29.796 --> 10:31.930
He didn't scam me.

10:31.932 --> 10:34.766
Oh, really? Yet, he went online
asking for a computer.

10:34.768 --> 10:37.002
If he didn't have one, how did he
get online in the first place?

10:37.004 --> 10:38.503
I never thought
of that.

10:38.505 --> 10:40.672
Maybe he used one at work,
or a friend's,

10:40.674 --> 10:42.107
or the library's.

10:42.109 --> 10:44.576
Libraries don't exist anymore.
Read a paper.

10:45.846 --> 10:48.279
And you have to
apply to college online, too.

10:48.281 --> 10:49.414
How did he do that?

10:49.416 --> 10:52.350
He didn't.
You were conned.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.285
He seemed very smart,

10:54.287 --> 10:56.021

to college.

Okay. Kyle, you're starting

I love that kid
like a son.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.816
But his good heart, you know,
makes him vulnerable

11:24.818 --> 11:27.619
for lots of things,
like the flu,

11:27.621 --> 11:30.822
because he keeps on giving away
his coat.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.490
All I know is Kyle
was a lot happier

at the world

I'm right on this one.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.275
Okay, you got it.

18:31.277 --> 18:33.578
Come home to the bubble,
have your meatloaf.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.313
I can't.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.115
When I told you
the whole point of my gap year

18:37.117 --> 18:38.816
was to figure out
how I fit into the world,

18:38.818 --> 18:40.318
you said the<i> real</i> world.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.886
Well, it don't get
any realer than this.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.621
Living in your sister's
basement rent-free

18:43.623 --> 18:46.324
is not the real world.
You just ask my cousin Stewart,

18:46.326 --> 18:48.926
and I do not want you
talking to him.

18:48.928 --> 18:52.396
It's not free.
I'm gonna pay rent.

18:52.398 --> 18:54.132
I'm gonna work part-time
at the coffee shop,

18:54.134 --> 18:55.800
as well
as perform there.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.401
All right. I-I think
you're taking this too far.

18:57.403 --> 18:59.637
I'm really happy
that you're working,

18:59.639 --> 19:03.007
but I don't want you
moving out of the house.

19:03.009 --> 19:04.809
It's really hard
to grow up

19:04.811 --> 19:07.078
when you live
with your parents, Dad.

19:07.080 --> 19:09.947
And I know you and Mom
will just do stuff for me.

19:09.949 --> 19:11.983
It's not your fault.
I'm just...

19:11.985 --> 19:13.351
I'm really adorable.

19:17.991 --> 19:20.091
I thought
that had peaked

19:20.093 --> 19:21.626
when we went
to Reagan's birthplace,

19:21.628 --> 19:26.097
and you -- you said it was
"tickle-down economics."

19:29.135 --> 19:32.170
It's time for me
to be on my own, Dad.

19:32.172 --> 19:36.007
That's what you've been
preparing me for my whole life.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.842
And you did a great job.

19:48.354 --> 19:51.522
You know,
I-I knew that one day

19:51.524 --> 19:53.324
being perfect
at everything I do

19:53.326 --> 19:55.426
was gonna bite me
in the ass.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.767
I'm gonna miss you, too.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.977
Hey, hi. You ready?

20:12.979 --> 20:14.212
Oh, hi. You bet.

20:14.214 --> 20:15.646
Hey, hey, hey.
How's the new car?

20:15.648 --> 20:17.014
Amazing. It's --

20:17.016 --> 20:19.150
It's the greatest gift
anyone's ever given me.

20:19.152 --> 20:21.519
Yeah, well,
whoever did that probably feels

20:21.521 --> 20:24.689
like they got the better part
of that deal, huh?

20:24.691 --> 20:27.291
I want to donate it
to charity.

20:29.162 --> 20:30.861
What? W-W-W-Wait.

20:30.863 --> 20:32.263
What do you mean?
Y-You're gonna give it away?

20:32.265 --> 20:33.598
What? Why?

20:33.600 --> 20:35.833
Well, I was finally
Dad's favorite,

20:35.835 --> 20:37.401
but then Eve one-upped me

20:37.403 --> 20:39.770
with that whole
self-sacrifice-y thing.

20:39.772 --> 20:42.173
Well, two can play
at that game.

20:42.175 --> 20:44.375
N-N-N-No.
D-Don't play. No, no.

20:44.377 --> 20:45.943
Y-Your greed is unique.

20:47.247 --> 20:50.414
I don't know, Ed.
Giving is a beautiful thing.

20:50.416 --> 20:52.416
It's good
for the heart.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.253
So is shutting up.

20:56.456 --> 20:57.922
No. I need
a grand gesture,

20:57.924 --> 20:59.857
but one that doesn't
cost me anything.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.926
And I haven't even put gas
in the car yet.

21:01.928 --> 21:06.030
Yeah, but it probably cost
somebody something.

21:06.032 --> 21:10.101
You know,
it's a lot of money, huh?

21:10.103 --> 21:11.702
Especially
with that moonroof --

21:11.704 --> 21:13.704
if it has one.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.940
It does.
You know what?

21:15.942 --> 21:18.209
Maybe we should give it away.
Yeah?

21:18.211 --> 21:20.378
Yeah, because I've learned
something

21:20.380 --> 21:22.813
very interesting from this
whole experience. Mm-hmm.

21:22.815 --> 21:24.949
I mean, getting a car...

21:24.951 --> 21:27.051
is really easy.
