00:24.330 --> 00:30.204
It makes you sick, what the world is.
These were the nicest people I ever met.

00:30.421 --> 00:33.208
- How long you work for them?
- Five years.

00:33.716 --> 00:36.718
Any kind of a problem,
domestic situation?

00:36.929 --> 00:40.594
- They weren't like that.
- Anybody angry at them?

00:40.766 --> 00:41.845
No.

00:42.686 --> 00:46.304
- What time you get here this morning?
- Around 8.

00:46.523 --> 00:51.482
And I knew something was wrong
because the back door was open.

00:52.114 --> 00:55.530
Did you see what
those animals did to them?

00:55.742 --> 00:59.326
Did you see what
they did to their poor daughter?

00:59.539 --> 01:02.990
Why didn't they take
what they wanted and leave?

01:03.169 --> 01:06.372
I don't know. I don't know.

01:06.589 --> 01:12.296
Could you make a list of people
with house access, like service people?

01:12.512 --> 01:14.091
- All right.
- Okay. James?

01:14.265 --> 01:15.427
MARTINEZ:
Yeah?

01:15.599 --> 01:17.973
This is Officer Martinez.
He'll take you.

01:18.186 --> 01:21.104
MARTINEZ: Sure.
- Thank you for your help, okay?

01:23.693 --> 01:28.106
I'm a big boy, but what happened
up there-- I don't know.

01:28.281 --> 01:30.820
These assholes like their work.

01:30.993 --> 01:35.870
The woman running the house says
the other daughter's in Connecticut.

01:36.041 --> 01:40.620
Is it the same crew that did
the burglary homicides in Riverdale?

01:40.796 --> 01:44.379
I'll call the other daughter.
You call Riverdale.

01:44.550 --> 01:45.962
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:46.177 --> 01:49.095
- No sale.
- No, I'm good.

01:49.264 --> 01:53.264
I'm uh....
I'm gonna go make the call.

02:55.093 --> 02:56.885
Oscar, Meyer, Weiner

03:09.152 --> 03:10.729
[FOOTSTEPS]

03:11.863 --> 03:16.858
- How are you, Officer Licalsi?
- I'd like to know what you decided.

03:17.036 --> 03:19.741
All right, from the top.

03:19.957 --> 03:24.001
You're not responsible
for your father being a bad cop...

03:24.211 --> 03:27.795
...or for Angelo Marino
trying to blackmail you.

03:27.966 --> 03:33.970
Nevertheless, your failure to report
the Marino approach was illegal.

03:34.140 --> 03:39.480
However, you have come forward now.
You reported this approach by Linardi.

03:39.647 --> 03:41.936
The approach was by a Richie.

03:42.149 --> 03:46.480
I think we're safe in assuming
your contact works for Linardi.

03:46.696 --> 03:50.030
You can clear your books
on the Marino matter...

03:50.283 --> 03:54.117
...if you document this
current solicitation by Linardi...

03:54.372 --> 03:57.872
...as well as any other criminal
activities of his.

03:58.084 --> 04:00.124
- They want you to run a plate for them?
- Yes.

04:00.337 --> 04:05.297
- Can you do that? Do you have access?
- Yeah.

04:05.511 --> 04:08.596
Do it and tell them you want to meet.

04:09.556 --> 04:11.265
And wear this.

04:11.893 --> 04:16.685
It's a tape recorder, unless you'd
rather wear a wire instead.

04:16.857 --> 04:20.392
I'd like to set up some boundaries,
a time frame.

04:20.570 --> 04:25.280
Once the investigation's begun,
I'll respond to your concerns.

04:25.492 --> 04:30.321
But this isn't open- ended.
I do this Linardi thing, and I'm done.

04:30.582 --> 04:33.418
I think that's what I just said.

04:33.752 --> 04:39.341
Needless to say, our arrangements and
your activities aren't to be discussed.

04:39.509 --> 04:42.630
- I understand.
- Have you confided in anyone?

04:42.847 --> 04:45.385
- Not really.
- What does that mean?

04:45.600 --> 04:48.851
It's all right.
It won't come into play.

04:49.271 --> 04:54.514
- I'll run this plate and call them.
- And stay in touch with me, officer.

04:54.903 --> 04:57.109
I'm your new best friend.

05:00.034 --> 05:03.985
MAN: This one, they got the
facial skin completely off. Look.

05:04.831 --> 05:07.074
Great. We get the idea.

05:07.292 --> 05:11.623
So both jobs, stolen items are
jewelry, cameras and pills.

05:11.839 --> 05:14.877
Murder weapon is a knife
from the kitchen.

05:15.052 --> 05:19.964
Same duct tape, vaginal penetration
with a foreign object after rape.

05:20.141 --> 05:21.968
Sounds like the same bunch.

05:22.143 --> 05:24.516
Four male blacks....
The only description you got?

05:24.730 --> 05:25.761
HANKIN:
Yeah.

05:25.940 --> 05:29.025
- They had to be tipped on this.
- I agree.

05:29.235 --> 05:32.237
We got a list
of delivery people and such.

05:32.489 --> 05:35.693
We'll see if anybody's
connected up your way.

05:35.910 --> 05:37.867
- We'll let you know.
KELLY: Thanks.

05:38.079 --> 05:41.828
MARTINEZ: That's okay.
MEDAVOY: When was the last service call?

05:42.084 --> 05:45.120
SHERMAN: Recall who was home?
MARTINEZ: Could I talk to him?

05:45.296 --> 05:47.704
MEDAVOY: What's your date of birth?
- Yeah, right.

05:47.924 --> 05:50.000
MARTINEZ: Thanks.
MEDAVOY: Anyone have access?

05:50.218 --> 05:55.214
- Who do we got?
- Mail carrier, exterminator and TV guy.

05:55.433 --> 05:58.803
SlPOWlCZ: Anything on our BCI checks?
- All clean.

05:59.020 --> 06:04.312
We still got water, grocery, dry
cleaner, carpet cleaner and masseuse.

06:04.861 --> 06:08.231
- I did the cleaners and carpet people.
- And?

06:08.407 --> 06:12.951
SHERMAN: Nothing there. All clean.
- I'll be back to help with the calls.

06:13.121 --> 06:16.123
- When does the daughter get in?
KELLY: In an hour.

06:16.333 --> 06:19.998
- James, make sure she gets met.
MARTINEZ: All right.

06:20.839 --> 06:23.924
- Anything else?
- No, more of the same.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.293
MEDAVOY:
This is Detective Medavoy.

06:31.810 --> 06:35.061
- Hi.
- Hi. How's it going?

06:35.314 --> 06:36.559
- Okay.
- Mm.

06:37.149 --> 06:39.023
- You see Lastarza?
- Yeah.

06:39.277 --> 06:40.819
How'd that go?

06:41.029 --> 06:43.983
- I won't talk to you about this.
- He doesn't want you to.

06:44.200 --> 06:48.494
- Johnny--
- Lie to him. He's lying to you.

06:48.955 --> 06:52.242
I'm not talking to you
because I don't want to...

06:52.418 --> 06:55.205
- ...but because of who you are.
- What's that mean?

06:55.379 --> 06:57.503
You're my lover.
I don't want you involved.

06:57.674 --> 07:03.963
- What if that's unacceptable to me?
- We'll try it. Maybe you'll get there.

07:15.528 --> 07:17.320
SERGEANT:
What do you got, Janice?

07:17.531 --> 07:22.989
This car's been on my block for a week.
Thought I'd see if it was stolen.

07:33.425 --> 07:37.174
When you delivered the water,
did you go in the house?

07:37.972 --> 07:40.808
How long were the Sloans
on your route?

07:42.018 --> 07:43.893
And your date of birth?

07:47.275 --> 07:52.518
Did you know that New York City
tap water tastes better than bottled?

07:52.698 --> 07:56.696
That's not me saying that.
That's independent testing.

07:56.869 --> 07:58.328
It was on the news.

07:58.497 --> 08:02.080
This bag held a lunch prepared
by my wife for me...

08:02.292 --> 08:05.330
...not the rodents
of the 1 5th Precinct.

08:05.505 --> 08:08.257
Get one of those metal lunch buckets.

08:08.509 --> 08:13.088
I wouldn't have to if you didn't
feed them. They're your fault.

08:13.264 --> 08:17.926
- They'll starve.
- Medavoy, better them than me.

08:18.687 --> 08:22.021
DONNA: This isn't a good time.
You may have to wait.

08:22.233 --> 08:23.514
All right.

08:24.319 --> 08:28.399
DONNA: There was a heinous murder,
and our detectives are busy.

08:28.824 --> 08:32.275
ARLAND: Well, that's all right.
I understand perfectly.

08:32.496 --> 08:36.328
- Can I help you?
- This gentleman is reporting a theft.

08:36.541 --> 08:38.581
Yes, I'm Arland Rickman.

08:38.794 --> 08:43.837
- I've seen you on talk shows.
- Yes, well, not so much lately.

08:44.426 --> 08:48.924
- You wanna come over to my desk here?
- Yes, thank you.

08:50.142 --> 08:52.099
SlPOWlCZ:
Have a seat.

08:52.811 --> 08:57.023
The man who robbed me was
just under 6 feet, 160 pounds...

08:57.233 --> 09:01.861
...peaches- and- cream complexion
and tousled, strawberry- blond hair.

09:02.072 --> 09:05.940
No scars or distinguishing marks
on his face or arms.

09:06.119 --> 09:12.289
But he does have a pierced scrotum.
He wears a little gold ball there.

09:12.919 --> 09:16.537
- You got a good look?
- Yes, from all angles.

09:18.383 --> 09:23.722
- What'd he steal from you?
- One item. My Oscar. My Academy Award.

09:23.931 --> 09:27.882
Do you believe it?
There was Baccarat crystal, FabergÃ©--

09:28.062 --> 09:31.513
- What's the Oscar worth?
- I couldn't guess.

09:31.690 --> 09:35.855
Whoever bought it would have
to keep it secret, right?

09:36.029 --> 09:40.110
Would that make the prize
more or less valuable to them?

09:40.326 --> 09:43.245
I'd love to figure out
what someone'd pay...

09:43.413 --> 09:46.748
...to whip his skippy
while gazing at your Oscar...

09:46.959 --> 09:50.163
...but we're working
on a multiple homicide now.

09:50.379 --> 09:53.915
Let's value it at more
than $500 and finish this.

09:54.134 --> 09:55.380
Fine.

09:55.594 --> 09:59.130
- You got a name on the thief?
- He said it was Bryce.

09:59.349 --> 10:00.891
B- R- I- C--

10:01.143 --> 10:03.301
My guess would be Y.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.098
B- R- Y- C- E.

10:07.233 --> 10:10.899
- Last name?
- It didn't come up.

10:11.822 --> 10:13.565
Any idea of an address?

10:13.783 --> 10:17.448
He's a transient,
just arrived from Denver.

10:17.662 --> 10:23.250
Your best bet is to track him through
Raoul, the bartender at Louise's.

10:23.503 --> 10:29.339
That's an open place for persons like
myself. It's where Bryce and I met.

10:29.551 --> 10:32.968
That's at 48th Street
on the West Side?

10:33.181 --> 10:35.090
Oh, you know it.

10:36.643 --> 10:40.558
Raoul tends to get on terms
with new blood quickly.

10:40.814 --> 10:45.145
He might just know where
our Bryce has pitched his tent.

10:45.362 --> 10:48.483
Here. Write down your address
and phone number.

10:48.658 --> 10:52.109
I'll get in touch
if I find out anything.

10:53.496 --> 10:57.411
I'm grateful
for your attention, detective.

10:57.960 --> 11:02.670
I know in the scale of your labors,
my loss is inconsequential.

11:02.883 --> 11:06.798
But as I seem to be retired
from the writing biz...

11:07.013 --> 11:12.388
...I don't expect to win more awards.
I'd be pleased to get this one back.

11:12.602 --> 11:15.937
I liked that book you wrote
about those cops.

11:16.149 --> 11:18.058
Did you?

11:20.529 --> 11:23.447
Yeah. I can read and everything.

11:32.292 --> 11:38.130
Hey! Yo, Officer Licalsi.
Got that thing we talked about?

11:38.300 --> 11:42.168
You want a rundown on a plate,
you better satisfy me.

11:42.389 --> 11:44.381
It's nothing heavy.

11:44.599 --> 11:48.051
Do better than that,
or I'll walk away right now.

11:48.270 --> 11:51.438
- You look like you might.
- I will.

11:51.858 --> 11:55.192
A bookmaker in our sphere
of influence...

11:55.362 --> 11:59.360
...might deal with an individual
who frequents a certain bar.

11:59.575 --> 12:03.656
Establishes credit with
the bookmaker to bet on events.

12:03.872 --> 12:09.211
The bookmaker has no phone or address
on him, maybe not his right name.

12:09.378 --> 12:12.250
Say this guy suffers some bad luck.

12:12.465 --> 12:18.173
lnstead of paying off his debts
or making arrangements, he disappears.

12:18.389 --> 12:22.933
Circumstance like that, we maintain
the bookmaker's credibility...

12:23.145 --> 12:25.767
...pressuring this man to make good.

12:25.940 --> 12:27.768
Doing what to him?

12:27.984 --> 12:33.525
I wouldn't let my imagination run.
Nobody collects money from a corpse.

12:33.741 --> 12:36.908
Are you satisfied, Janice?

12:42.209 --> 12:47.501
You read the sports section, Janice?
Because you're on the team now.

12:50.470 --> 12:53.804
Take care. I'll be in touch.

13:18.795 --> 13:22.840
- Right over here.
- I'm looking for Detective Kelly.

13:23.008 --> 13:26.757
He's out now.
Would you like to take a seat?

13:30.726 --> 13:33.893
- Are you Rebecca Sloan?
- Yes.

13:34.104 --> 13:38.434
I'm Detective Sipowicz.
I work with Detective Kelly.

13:39.444 --> 13:43.739
I'm sorry for your loss.
Are you being treated okay?

13:43.949 --> 13:46.073
Yes, everyone's been helpful.

13:46.286 --> 13:49.737
Why don't you come with me?
We can talk in there.

13:54.337 --> 13:57.255
I realize this is a bad time for you.

13:57.507 --> 14:02.848
But the sooner we find out all we can,
the better chance of finding them.

14:03.056 --> 14:05.179
What do you wanna know?

14:05.392 --> 14:10.304
We think whoever did this
knew the layout of the residence.

14:10.523 --> 14:14.687
Are there people you associated with,
came to your house...

14:14.903 --> 14:18.487
- ...but you didn't know well?
- I don't understand.

14:18.700 --> 14:22.947
People whose social or economic
strata might be different.

14:23.121 --> 14:27.251
My parents taught me not to make
that kind of distinction.

14:28.252 --> 14:34.707
Rebecca, how we work a case is, we go
by what happens in the real world.

14:35.470 --> 14:39.883
In the real world, well- to- do people
don't break into houses...

14:40.100 --> 14:42.936
...steal things
and murder the occupants.

14:43.145 --> 14:45.268
Can you help with that type?

14:45.689 --> 14:50.020
- From other "social strata"?
- Black acquaintances especially.

14:50.237 --> 14:53.607
I have black acquaintances,
who are poor.

14:53.824 --> 14:58.534
- Any from the Bronx?
- What difference would that make?

15:00.248 --> 15:04.912
Several similar crimes have
occurred in the Bronx, in Riverdale.

15:05.129 --> 15:08.998
Witnesses described
the perpetrators as black.

15:09.218 --> 15:11.674
I hate thinking like this.

15:13.306 --> 15:14.717
Rebecca.

15:16.060 --> 15:21.185
These people did terrible, terrible
things, and we need to find them.

15:21.400 --> 15:26.311
I'm not passing judgment on you,
your family or anyone you've known.

15:26.531 --> 15:29.532
I'm looking for something to go on.

15:29.742 --> 15:33.159
Is there anyone that comes to mind?

15:38.127 --> 15:43.170
I went out with a guy last year,
Lewis Futrel.

15:43.634 --> 15:47.169
He's from the Bronx, and he's black.

15:49.057 --> 15:54.515
- Is that F- U- T- R- E- L?
- Yes.

16:24.391 --> 16:27.427
- We are definitely gonna talk later.
LlCALSl: We are.

16:27.603 --> 16:31.897
- I saw you meet your greaseball.
- I know you did. I saw you.

16:32.066 --> 16:37.192
Before we talk, think how bad you'd
have jammed me up if he saw you too.

16:39.743 --> 16:42.613
SlPOWlCZ:
We'd be grateful if you could come in.

16:42.830 --> 16:45.582
It's completely routine, Mr. Futrel.

16:45.791 --> 16:49.706
We're just running down
certain aspects of the case.

16:49.962 --> 16:54.922
Right. Just ask for Detective Sipowicz.
They'll send you right up.

16:58.473 --> 17:02.424
We'll keep you posted
on any developments, Miss Sloan.

17:02.644 --> 17:07.557
- Uh, where are you gonna be?
- At my cousin's in Connecticut.

17:07.733 --> 17:10.569
I don't wanna live
in this city anymore.

17:10.905 --> 17:14.522
Officer Miller here will see
that you get a ride.

17:15.035 --> 17:17.442
Listen, you take care now.

17:21.250 --> 17:22.875
- Is that the daughter?
SlPOWlCZ: Yeah.

17:23.044 --> 17:26.994
- I'm sorry, I got held up.
- The daughter give us anything?

17:27.215 --> 17:31.000
She dated a black guy from the Bronx.
He's coming in.

17:31.595 --> 17:36.223
- You got anything working?
- I'm running down the service people.

17:40.606 --> 17:41.982
What's going on?

17:42.484 --> 17:45.900
- Nothing.
- Don't talk to me like a jerk.

17:46.113 --> 17:50.408
It's nothing. I'll start pulling
my weight on this, okay?

17:50.702 --> 17:55.246
Yeah, that's why I asked you.
I keep very close tabs, you know.

17:55.458 --> 17:58.709
I carry you a few more years,
you'll owe me.

17:59.045 --> 18:00.456
- Detective Sipowicz?
SlPOWlCZ: Yeah?

18:00.630 --> 18:01.876
Mr. Meyers is here.

18:02.383 --> 18:03.758
Sammy.

18:03.967 --> 18:07.503
- I got your message, detective.
SlPOWlCZ: Sit down.

18:08.514 --> 18:11.006
You know why I reached out to you?

18:11.185 --> 18:16.346
Because we go back. Nobody knows better
than me your sense of civic duty.

18:16.525 --> 18:19.941
I got my sister's putz kid
running the pawnshop...

18:20.112 --> 18:22.650
...so the more haste, the less waste.

18:22.865 --> 18:28.620
I got a stolen statue, a movie Oscar.
And a murder that's making demands.

18:29.040 --> 18:31.365
I don't see my relevance.

18:31.584 --> 18:35.120
Whoever that statue starts out
getting pawned to...

18:35.338 --> 18:37.664
...eventually, it'll come to you.

18:37.884 --> 18:40.635
You punish me
for knowing collectibles.

18:40.803 --> 18:43.260
I punish you for buying them hot.

18:43.473 --> 18:48.183
You don't want us swooping down
on your pawn joint unannounced.

18:48.396 --> 18:51.066
Checking inventory on your ledgers...

18:51.274 --> 18:54.441
...holding your items,
damming your cash flow.

18:54.653 --> 18:59.696
I'm guessing, could this be an Oscar
in the Best Screenplay category?

18:59.868 --> 19:04.495
- Circa somewhere around 1958?
- You should have been a mentalist.

19:04.707 --> 19:07.828
I've heard rustlings.
Very preliminary.

19:08.044 --> 19:13.086
A colleague didn't have it yet
but wanted to know a ballpark worth.

19:13.300 --> 19:16.337
- And what would that be?
- Twenty- five.

19:17.431 --> 19:19.720
- Thousand?
- You think that's a lot?

19:19.892 --> 19:23.511
When a matchbook Lennon wrote
"screw you" on is 15?

19:23.729 --> 19:28.059
Sammy, you get me that statue,
I'll owe you a backscratch.

19:28.276 --> 19:29.937
I'll keep you posted.

19:30.696 --> 19:33.698
- 1991 playoffs?
- Correct.

19:33.950 --> 19:37.651
Autographed by Leetch and Messier.

19:37.913 --> 19:41.994
- I'll give you $40 for it now.
- Not interested.

19:42.209 --> 19:47.715
Don't believe those prices on TV. That
market's pumped like Holland tulips.

19:53.515 --> 19:55.639
- Hey.
- Hi, Johnny.

19:56.143 --> 19:58.350
- What's going on? You all right?

19:58.563 --> 20:01.480
I got transferred
to the lnvestigation Bureau.

20:01.734 --> 20:05.898
- You're kidding. You're a riding DA?
- You okay with that?

20:06.113 --> 20:07.905
That sounds great.

20:09.367 --> 20:12.239
- I've gotta take a statement.
- Go ahead.

20:12.413 --> 20:14.156
I'll buy you a coffee.

20:14.331 --> 20:16.621
- Okay.
- All right.

20:26.429 --> 20:30.012
- I think maybe I got something here.
- Let me see.

20:30.183 --> 20:33.268
That maid at the victims',
Renee Pendergast.

20:33.437 --> 20:35.811
She's clean. I did this check.

20:35.983 --> 20:41.440
She's on two stop- and- frisk reports
and was questioned during drug sweeps.

20:41.655 --> 20:44.942
- Flying James.
- I thought that was something.

20:45.160 --> 20:50.404
My name is Lewis Futrel. I'm an
architecture student at Hunter College.

20:50.625 --> 20:56.249
- I live on 147th Street in the Bronx.
- Forgot your rank and serial number.

20:56.465 --> 21:01.211
A black man dating a white woman.
That makes me a murder suspect.

21:01.430 --> 21:04.347
Right now, I consider you
a model citizen...

21:04.517 --> 21:07.803
...which is why I was hoping
you'd help us out.

21:07.979 --> 21:12.392
Two nights ago, I was up
until 3:00 a. m. , studying for a test.

21:12.568 --> 21:14.062
I have witnesses.

21:14.236 --> 21:16.479
I'll need those names.

21:16.656 --> 21:21.034
And assuming I get them,
you're not a suspect in these murders.

21:21.244 --> 21:23.653
What I'm most interested in is...

21:23.873 --> 21:28.037
...did you discuss with friends
your relationship with Rebecca?

21:28.211 --> 21:33.372
Her lifestyle, her place. Did that
come up when you talked with friends?

21:33.551 --> 21:35.425
I get it.

21:35.636 --> 21:40.977
I'm not a criminal, but get enough
niggas together, and some must be.

21:41.143 --> 21:45.889
Rebecca said one reason she broke up
with you was your rough crowd.

21:46.108 --> 21:49.857
So I go to the criminal niggas,
say,"Guess what?

21:50.029 --> 21:55.107
I'm boning this rich girl. Here's
her home, where the jewelry's hidden."

21:55.285 --> 21:59.948
- That the scenario you envision?
- Have I been disrespectful to you?

22:00.124 --> 22:04.039
- Me being here is disrespectful.
- Hey, pal!

22:05.047 --> 22:10.422
I'm looking for some assholes before
they murder another innocent family.

22:10.637 --> 22:14.885
It happens these particular assholes
happen to be black.

22:15.059 --> 22:17.930
Now, how do you want me
to go about this?

22:18.104 --> 22:20.856
Maybe I'll start each question with:

22:21.066 --> 22:26.487
"I'm sorry for the injustices the white
man has inflicted upon your race...

22:26.656 --> 22:29.573
...but can you provide
any information?"

22:29.785 --> 22:33.949
Or "I'm sorry your people are
downtrodden for 300 years...

22:34.165 --> 22:38.246
...but did you discuss
the Sloan house with your friends?"

22:38.462 --> 22:41.333
- Yeah, do it like that.
- Yeah, okay.

22:41.549 --> 22:47.634
I know that African- American George
Washington Carver discovered peanuts...

22:47.848 --> 22:52.510
...but can you provide names
and addresses of these friends?

22:52.728 --> 22:55.979
You know, you're a racist scumbag.

22:56.358 --> 22:58.066
Ouch.

22:59.320 --> 23:01.858
I need names of black friends...

23:02.032 --> 23:06.907
...who have shown special interest
or visited Rebecca's home with you.

23:12.878 --> 23:14.159
I need a pen.

23:32.860 --> 23:34.983
- Do you want a beer?
- No.

23:39.201 --> 23:42.155
Look,
this following- you- around thing....

23:42.372 --> 23:46.749
It's because I'm worried,
and you won't say what's going on.

23:46.960 --> 23:48.869
I told you why I wouldn't.

23:49.087 --> 23:54.166
I need you to love me, okay?
It's up to me to take care of myself.

23:54.385 --> 23:58.004
Let's stop the word games.
You're kidding yourself.

23:58.182 --> 24:01.633
You lie down with scum
like Linardi and Lastarza--

24:01.811 --> 24:04.433
- I'm working.
- I know what you're doing.

24:04.606 --> 24:09.150
You're getting clean by doing
something dirty. It won't work.

24:09.320 --> 24:12.771
- They're leading you by the nose.
- Don't do this.

24:12.950 --> 24:14.741
- I know how it works.
- Me too.

24:14.910 --> 24:17.579
- You're in too deep.
- I know where I am.

24:17.747 --> 24:22.326
- Talking like that won't help.
- Who else will tell you the truth?

24:22.502 --> 24:26.666
The truth? The truth is
that this is my life. Mine.

24:27.300 --> 24:30.336
You can't have it both ways,
not with me.

24:30.511 --> 24:33.881
We can't make a life,
then you go your own way.

24:34.058 --> 24:37.392
This is the only way
we can have a life.

25:01.341 --> 25:06.087
I was in trouble once for stolen
credit cards three years ago.

25:06.263 --> 25:10.724
- How long have you known Lewis Futrel?
- We grew up together.

25:10.893 --> 25:15.106
- Are you still tight with him now?
- Not too tight.

25:15.315 --> 25:19.396
You wanna ask me about that murdered
family, Lewis dated the daughter?

25:19.570 --> 25:20.601
Uh- huh.

25:20.988 --> 25:26.826
I had nothing to do with that. I never
broken in and never done no violence.

25:26.996 --> 25:31.742
Some trouble three years ago,
stolen credit cards.

25:31.960 --> 25:35.662
Can you verify your whereabouts
two nights ago?

25:35.881 --> 25:38.836
I was balling all night.

25:39.594 --> 25:42.596
Why don't you give me
the lucky lady's name?

25:51.525 --> 25:55.191
- Hey, Renee.
- Detective, what are you doing here?

25:55.363 --> 25:58.281
Just wanna ask a couple of questions.

25:58.450 --> 26:01.617
- I have a job interview.
- It won't take long.

26:01.787 --> 26:05.073
Can I answer the questions?
I have an interview.

26:05.249 --> 26:07.243
Are you a junkie, Renee?

26:11.716 --> 26:12.748
Huh?

26:13.217 --> 26:16.053
- Would I find tracks on your arms?
- No.

26:16.263 --> 26:20.392
If I took you to the station,
let the policewoman look?

26:20.560 --> 26:23.929
Under your tongue,
inside your thighs, nothing?

26:24.105 --> 26:26.145
What's this about?

26:26.316 --> 26:30.730
You were questioned twice
during drug sweeps. You're on file.

26:30.905 --> 26:34.073
I had nothing to do
with what happened.

26:34.284 --> 26:39.326
- What else didn't you tell me?
- I'd never do anything to hurt them.

26:39.499 --> 26:42.370
- You have drugs delivered to the house?
- No.

26:42.544 --> 26:43.955
No?

26:44.129 --> 26:49.291
This isn't a walkaway- possession bit.
We're talking accessory to murder.

26:49.469 --> 26:52.174
I did nothing. They were good to me.

26:52.348 --> 26:55.682
Did you ever have drugs
delivered to the house?

26:58.563 --> 27:02.644
Twice. Twice. When I couldn't get out.

27:02.860 --> 27:06.111
- The dealer look around?
- Just the kitchen.

27:06.281 --> 27:09.864
The kitchen entrance.
He couldn't have done this.

27:10.035 --> 27:14.199
- He's not violent.
- You gave him the floor plan, right?

27:15.625 --> 27:17.749
Is that what happened?

27:21.048 --> 27:23.338
His name's Kenny Prins.

27:25.304 --> 27:28.222
Okay. You gonna help me with this?

27:28.391 --> 27:30.514
Yeah.

27:31.018 --> 27:32.394
Good.

27:32.604 --> 27:34.062
Come on.

27:40.237 --> 27:41.483
That's him.

27:41.656 --> 27:45.524
OFFICER: He's in the dark coat
and khakis, crossing the street.

27:45.703 --> 27:49.452
KELLY: Get her down!
OFFICER: Get your head down. Stay down.

27:50.918 --> 27:53.408
MARTINEZ:
Police. Are you Kenny Prins?

27:53.629 --> 27:55.171
KELLY:
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

27:55.339 --> 27:58.792
PRINS: What do you want?
- Relax.

27:58.969 --> 28:02.220
You got nothing on me. I'm clean.

28:02.389 --> 28:05.557
- If you did it, you'll burn in hell.
- Shut up.

28:05.727 --> 28:09.096
- Who's that?
- We're not doing three acts of opera.

28:09.272 --> 28:12.523
PRINS: I want a lawyer.
KELLY: I can't give it to you here.

28:12.693 --> 28:15.943
- You stupid bitch!
KELLY: Shut up and get in the car.

28:16.114 --> 28:18.819
You'll get your lawyer downtown.

28:19.409 --> 28:23.989
You want your lawyer. You don't
wanna talk to us, that's fine.

28:24.166 --> 28:30.620
But listen to me because you're about
to turn a walk into 25 years. Okay?

28:30.840 --> 28:36.677
We're about to pop the guys who did the
break- in and murder. Half a day, tops.

28:36.889 --> 28:41.184
We know you moved dope to the maid
and accessed the house.

28:41.394 --> 28:46.851
But if we find out that you sold the
layout and described the alarm system...

28:47.026 --> 28:52.069
...when you could've helped us,
you just bought accessory to murder.

28:52.241 --> 28:54.862
Twenty- five years, Kenny.

28:55.077 --> 29:00.155
Or you do the right thing, and you
tell us who you sold the layout to...

29:00.333 --> 29:05.673
...the DA will cut you a deal.
You're out and back in business.

29:05.840 --> 29:09.458
You wanna think about it,
discuss it with your guy?

29:09.636 --> 29:12.887
Take your time,
but not too much, Kenny.

29:13.391 --> 29:18.302
Because God forbid these scumbags
are out there doing another job.

29:18.522 --> 29:24.228
God forbid this happens again
before we can snatch them up, Kenny.

29:24.446 --> 29:26.901
Because then it'll be on you.

29:30.870 --> 29:33.028
LAURA:
He has no priors like this.

29:33.205 --> 29:38.118
The arresting officer feels he wasn't
involved in the crime itself.

29:38.337 --> 29:41.042
Claims he knows their whereabouts.

29:41.340 --> 29:43.963
I'd go for it. Okay.

29:44.928 --> 29:50.553
If he gives good information, he'd be
a witness rather than a perpetrator.

29:50.727 --> 29:54.476
Can't be a phone- book address.
He's gotta finger these guys.

29:54.648 --> 29:56.725
What about the other charges?

29:56.901 --> 30:01.647
We'd decline on the possession charge
and failure to appear.

30:01.865 --> 30:04.072
Sounds like a plan.

30:08.873 --> 30:10.665
[PHONE RINGS]

30:12.628 --> 30:15.463
15th Precinct, Officer Licalsi.

30:20.012 --> 30:23.880
Corner, A and 10th.

30:25.726 --> 30:28.182
Green four- door.

30:29.064 --> 30:31.306
Do you know the model?

30:32.234 --> 30:33.693
Ford.

30:34.487 --> 30:39.031
Any idea of the year? No, that's okay.

30:39.827 --> 30:41.701
lnjuries?

30:42.747 --> 30:47.374
Uh, did you get a license plate
by any chance?

30:48.921 --> 30:53.880
SZU766.

30:55.178 --> 30:59.047
Hold on, I'm gonna get
somebody over there, okay?

31:02.812 --> 31:06.396
<i>- 15th Base to Central. Kay.
WOMAN: Go ahead, 15th Base. </i>

31:06.609 --> 31:09.978
We need a fire unit, ambulance
and sector cars...

31:10.155 --> 31:12.860
...to Avenue A and 10th,
car explosion.

31:13.033 --> 31:15.191
<i>10- 4. Units are on their way. </i>

31:15.369 --> 31:20.530
SERGEANT: What do we got?
- A car explosion, one fatality.

31:21.209 --> 31:24.579
That's the report.
I made the notifications.

31:24.755 --> 31:28.706
- Thanks.
- I'll need a couple hours' lost time.

31:28.927 --> 31:32.843
- What's going on?
- I don't feel so good.

31:34.267 --> 31:40.555
Sammy, I can't hear you. Ask the guy
to stop squawking the saxophone.

31:41.067 --> 31:44.851
That's great, Sammy.
Where's he supposed to meet?

31:45.071 --> 31:47.824
Is he gonna have the statue with him?

31:47.992 --> 31:52.785
Tell your buddy not to worry
about the statue, just set the meet.

31:52.956 --> 31:56.539
We'll send someone over there
to grab the kid up.

31:56.710 --> 32:00.579
Right, okay, you're a prince. Huh?

32:01.090 --> 32:06.430
You'll go as high as 60 for the
Rangers pennant. I'll pass that along.

32:07.515 --> 32:10.801
Andy, we're in business.

32:18.694 --> 32:21.186
PRINS:
First floor, up front, right side.

32:21.364 --> 32:24.485
KELLY: ESU cops are in position.
- Let's go.

32:52.402 --> 32:54.975
- Police!
MAN: Be with you right away.

32:55.155 --> 33:00.660
- Come out with your hands on your head.
MAN: I'm completing my business.

33:01.204 --> 33:03.197
- You Coleman?
- Rajib.

33:03.498 --> 33:07.366
What have you been eating,
some kind of wild game?

33:07.795 --> 33:08.826
SlPOWlCZ:
Hey!

33:09.005 --> 33:12.873
- I thought that was it. I was sick.
- Not good enough.

33:13.051 --> 33:16.503
- Am I supposed to knock on every door?
- Call them.

33:16.680 --> 33:21.094
And ask where they live?
Then 20 seconds later 14 cops show?

33:21.269 --> 33:23.511
Don't you think they'll know?

33:23.689 --> 33:28.601
I want you to warn them that the cops
are on the way and to get out.

33:28.778 --> 33:33.406
I fingered these guys.
I went out on a limb. Why can't you-- ?

33:33.618 --> 33:36.703
- Dial the phone, Kenny.
- All right.

33:37.663 --> 33:38.993
All right.

33:41.919 --> 33:46.962
Clarence. It's Kenny. You guys
better book. The cops are on their way.

33:47.175 --> 33:52.930
I didn't say anything. I took a bust.
They found your address in my crib.

33:54.601 --> 33:57.306
You guys better get going.

33:57.562 --> 33:59.187
Happy?

34:27.306 --> 34:29.132
MAN:
Put them on the table.

34:29.308 --> 34:33.389
MARTINEZ: Relax, I'll do the rolling.
COLEMAN: Easy, man.

34:35.065 --> 34:38.518
MAN: You. Step over here, please.
- Nice going, guys.

34:38.777 --> 34:42.907
- The Bronx Squad is on their way down.
- How's our case?

34:43.117 --> 34:46.985
Found the weapon and stolen goods
in their apartment.

34:47.163 --> 34:51.742
- The new DA thinks we're all right?
- She thinks we're all right.

34:53.045 --> 34:56.331
Andy, your Oscar suspect's
in lnterview 1.

34:56.549 --> 34:58.423
Thanks, Medavoy.

35:01.013 --> 35:04.465
- You would be Bryce?
- Yes, sir.

35:06.186 --> 35:08.593
I'm Detective Sipowicz.

35:08.814 --> 35:12.729
This is not where I planned
to be today, not ever.

35:12.944 --> 35:15.946
Life's full of little
surprises, Bryce.

35:16.156 --> 35:19.277
This is new to me,
and I'm a little scared.

35:19.493 --> 35:20.774
I understand.

35:20.953 --> 35:24.619
But I plan to deal with it.
I intend to cooperate.

35:24.833 --> 35:30.173
That's a very positive answer.
I'm asking a straightforward question.

35:30.715 --> 35:33.385
Did you steal Arland Rickman's Oscar?

35:33.551 --> 35:37.717
- Could you take these off?
- First, how about that Oscar?

35:38.308 --> 35:44.145
What happened was, I got off the bus
at the Port Authority Terminal on 40th.

35:44.398 --> 35:47.649
I went to Louise's Grill,
which is famous.

35:47.860 --> 35:51.277
I ordered a kamikaze.
Guess who paid for it?

35:51.490 --> 35:55.440
My first cocktail in New York City.
Arland Rickman.

35:55.661 --> 35:59.742
- I mean, it was unbelievably vivid.
- Was it?

35:59.958 --> 36:04.087
I was energized by the environment.
This is a vivid city.

36:04.296 --> 36:07.916
- We left. You know about the sex?
- Not interested.

36:08.093 --> 36:11.629
- He was generous. He gave me advice.
- Money?

36:11.806 --> 36:14.973
- Money and advice.
- Then you robbed him.

36:15.143 --> 36:18.976
It didn't seem like that.
It was like he wanted it.

36:19.148 --> 36:22.731
He was drunk, showed me the Oscar
and passed out.

36:22.902 --> 36:24.646
- You didn't beat him up?
- No.

36:24.821 --> 36:28.689
He was bruised when I met him.
You know what I think?

36:28.867 --> 36:33.946
I think he's a very lonely person
despite all the success and fame.

36:34.124 --> 36:39.830
You've got a shot at avoiding a trip
to New York's Rikers lsland prison...

36:40.006 --> 36:42.961
...which is a very
vivid place indeed.

36:43.218 --> 36:46.338
But you need to answer
the next question.

36:46.513 --> 36:49.088
Oscar's in a locker at Penn Station.

36:49.267 --> 36:53.977
The key's in my pocket. It's in
a tote bag along with his socks.

36:54.147 --> 36:55.856
Whose socks?

36:56.025 --> 36:58.599
Arland Rickman's socks.

37:01.615 --> 37:03.359
BRYCE:
Thank you.

37:04.327 --> 37:06.569
Yeah.

37:12.378 --> 37:15.997
These birds are boycotting me.
I'm throwing food.

37:16.174 --> 37:19.674
What happened to Joey O'Brien?
You remember him?

37:19.845 --> 37:23.464
- His car got blown up.
- With him in it. What happened?

37:23.808 --> 37:28.270
I think the question that
you're asking is, did we do it?

37:28.481 --> 37:31.316
The answer is, we did not.

37:32.860 --> 37:35.150
You gonna cross your heart?

37:35.322 --> 37:40.068
Officer, you got credit cards, right?
Two, three, four, whatever.

37:40.286 --> 37:44.367
Would you use up all your credit
on one card, your Visa?

37:45.042 --> 37:50.547
No. If you're irresponsible, desperate,
whatever, you'd use them all up.

37:50.757 --> 37:53.296
Now, that's what Joey O'Brien did.

37:53.469 --> 37:57.336
It's obvious some less patient
and reasonable people...

37:57.557 --> 37:59.883
...got to him before we did.

38:00.560 --> 38:03.977
- It wasn't you?
- It wasn't us.

38:04.982 --> 38:07.818
Is your conscience clear now?

38:08.361 --> 38:11.280
Tommy said thanks
for the license plate.

38:11.448 --> 38:14.070
He's looking forward to meeting.

38:14.910 --> 38:18.245
Take care. I'll be in touch soon.

38:21.377 --> 38:23.869
Don't get cancer, Richie.

38:29.428 --> 38:33.011
MAN: Here you go.
FUTREL: Detective Sipowicz.

38:33.225 --> 38:37.389
I saw on the radio how arrests
were made on those murders.

38:37.563 --> 38:39.271
Come to congratulate us?

38:39.607 --> 38:45.113
Somebody was doing real detective work
while you harassed me and my friends.

38:45.280 --> 38:50.026
- Sorry you took it that way.
- I wanna hear you say you harassed me.

38:50.245 --> 38:55.785
Say we're not suspects, which Detective
Andrew Sipowicz may not believe...

38:55.959 --> 38:58.581
...as he thinks
we're lowlife niggas.

38:58.796 --> 39:02.498
- All right. You're done.
- I'll say when I'm done.

39:02.717 --> 39:04.592
I'm saying you're done.

39:04.761 --> 39:08.595
Talk about Carver again,
you ignorant, cracker bigot.

39:08.767 --> 39:12.848
- Excuse me. What's your business here?
SlPOWlCZ: This is Mr. Futrel.

39:13.022 --> 39:16.640
He was questioned
and cleared in the Sloan matter.

39:16.818 --> 39:21.564
- Your business here is finished.
FUTREL: I'd love to take you on.

39:21.740 --> 39:26.202
- Without your gun, fire hose and badge.
- Here's my card.

39:26.747 --> 39:30.827
Thank you for your cooperation.
You can leave now.

39:31.335 --> 39:35.168
You work in the big house now, boy?
What door you use?

39:35.340 --> 39:38.544
You can leave now, Mr. Futrel.

39:45.936 --> 39:49.935
- You busy tonight?
- I got no big plans.

39:50.108 --> 39:55.448
Detective Sipowicz. I got your message,
you found it. You did, didn't you?

39:55.656 --> 39:58.942
- Yeah, come on.
- Thank you.

40:03.123 --> 40:05.697
- Here you go.
- Wonderful.

40:06.627 --> 40:08.003
I'm very grateful.

40:08.296 --> 40:12.341
The kid's in the pen.
How do you want to handle that?

40:14.052 --> 40:17.968
Well, I'm not inclined
to press charges.

40:18.642 --> 40:22.426
- There's no harm done, as we say.
- Suit yourself.

40:22.646 --> 40:29.017
Detective, could you abide a gesture
of gratitude from an old queen?

40:29.738 --> 40:31.778
It depends on the gesture.

40:32.784 --> 40:36.651
Here is the book of mine
you said you had enjoyed.

40:36.829 --> 40:39.452
Well, I signed it for you.

40:44.380 --> 40:49.090
I bet when you wrote this,
you weren't at bars midmorning...

40:49.344 --> 40:53.426
...picking up douche bags,
who'd rob your medals, huh?

40:53.600 --> 40:56.173
My work habits were more rigorous.

40:56.395 --> 41:01.639
- Anything keeping you from that?
- Only a failing physical condition.

41:02.152 --> 41:06.150
Plus the general rout of my faculties.

41:06.323 --> 41:09.823
And a pervasive sense of despair.

41:10.036 --> 41:12.610
In other words, you're getting old.

41:14.124 --> 41:19.369
- I suppose it doesn't make me unique.
- Take a shot. I bet you can still do it.

41:22.259 --> 41:25.842
I get my Oscar back
and a lecture on freewill.

41:26.055 --> 41:29.507
That's why this is
a great police department.

41:30.894 --> 41:32.353
Thanks for the book.

41:45.412 --> 41:48.863
- Hey, John.
- Hey.

41:51.460 --> 41:56.088
- You still eligible for conversation?
- Sure.

41:57.384 --> 42:01.430
I'm involved
with that uniform, Licalsi.

42:01.639 --> 42:04.557
Whoa. There's a bolt from the blue.

42:05.352 --> 42:10.560
Anyway, she's involved
in this complicated situation.

42:10.733 --> 42:13.984
I don't wanna go into the details now.

42:14.154 --> 42:19.316
But I'm worried, and she won't let me
help her. I don't know what to do.

42:19.494 --> 42:24.786
- What would you do if she'd let you?
- I don't know. I'm not sure.

42:25.001 --> 42:28.750
- I'd step in, right?
- And do what?

42:29.715 --> 42:34.591
- I don't know that either.
- So you got a well- thought- out plan.

42:34.804 --> 42:37.924
She just won't let you
put it in motion, huh?

42:39.101 --> 42:40.844
Look....

42:43.772 --> 42:46.940
Maybe she's right,
not letting you step in.

42:47.110 --> 42:53.363
She is so far over her head.
Of course, that's my opinion.

42:53.534 --> 42:56.785
- But this is hard for me.
- You wanna take the weight for her.

42:56.955 --> 42:58.948
Yeah.

43:00.251 --> 43:03.169
I don't know what to tell you, John.

43:06.758 --> 43:10.804
When I was drinking, and my old lady
wouldn't cooperate...

43:10.972 --> 43:16.215
...my angle was, I'd smack her around.
Probably that was the wrong approach.

43:16.395 --> 43:18.187
Probably.

43:18.564 --> 43:21.020
- You ready?
- Yeah.

43:21.193 --> 43:23.435
- Good job today, John.
- Thanks, lieutenant.

43:23.654 --> 43:28.897
It wasn't me who popped the maid
from the files. That was Martinez.

43:29.119 --> 43:30.993
He's gonna be a good cop, huh?

43:31.162 --> 43:34.247
- Yeah.
- Good night.

43:41.800 --> 43:45.929
- You all right?
- Yeah, go ahead. I'll be fine.

43:46.181 --> 43:49.135
Hey, thanks, man.

43:49.309 --> 43:51.137
You got it.

43:53.189 --> 43:54.814
- I'll see you, John.
- Yeah.

44:06.621 --> 44:08.246
LAURA: Good night.
- Hey.

44:08.874 --> 44:13.668
- Thanks for the help today.
- I'm glad it worked out.

44:15.757 --> 44:17.418
Laurie.

44:22.641 --> 44:27.303
Was it the job or not giving you
enough room that broke us up?

44:27.521 --> 44:29.146
I don't know.

44:29.315 --> 44:34.025
What made you good at your job
made it hard to be with you at home.

44:34.196 --> 44:38.693
- Which wasn't that much, right?
- Which wasn't that much.

44:39.577 --> 44:41.238
Why do you ask?

44:41.413 --> 44:44.533
No, I was--
I was just wondering.

44:47.420 --> 44:49.129
Try giving her room.

44:53.719 --> 44:55.593
- Good night.
- Yeah.

45:27.927 --> 45:31.012
- How's your food?
- Good.

45:32.515 --> 45:33.927
You try the slaw?

45:35.644 --> 45:40.473
- You getting your jollies out of this?
- What do you mean?

45:40.650 --> 45:46.773
You think I'm a racist. You're rubbing
my nose in it? Let me tell you something.

45:46.991 --> 45:52.235
I'm entitled to my feelings and my
opinion as long as I do my job right.

45:53.040 --> 45:56.908
That Sloan investigation
went by the numbers.

45:57.212 --> 46:01.044
- I had a description: four black men.
- Andy.

46:01.258 --> 46:06.502
I asked if she had any black friends
because that was my suspect profile.

46:06.723 --> 46:10.223
I gave Futrel zero noise
till he got in my face.

46:10.436 --> 46:13.437
You handled
the investigation properly.

46:13.648 --> 46:18.394
- So, what am I doing here?
- I thought you might enjoy a meal.

46:19.071 --> 46:20.731
Yeah, sure.

46:20.948 --> 46:25.029
- What, you're not enjoying it?
- It's all right.

46:25.245 --> 46:29.244
- Food's okay?
- Yeah. It's not exactly what I eat.

46:29.458 --> 46:33.836
It's not what I usually eat either,
but sometimes it's good.

46:34.047 --> 46:37.215
- It's okay.
- Why aren't you enjoying it?

46:37.426 --> 46:41.128
Let me know when you get done
busting my balls.

46:41.306 --> 46:45.138
- Is it the atmosphere, Andy?
- That's possible.

46:45.310 --> 46:50.518
- Perhaps me being the only white guy.
- Now, why's that a problem?

46:51.109 --> 46:57.398
Because you feel this isn't your place,
and maybe some of these people agree?

46:57.617 --> 47:01.117
- Maybe a few don't like you?
- What's your point?

47:01.329 --> 47:05.031
You're being served, aren't you?
They cooked for you.

47:05.209 --> 47:08.745
Maybe they wanted to spit in it,
but they didn't.

47:08.922 --> 47:12.506
They served your white ass
like anybody else here...

47:12.677 --> 47:15.382
...even though some of them hate you.

47:15.597 --> 47:18.468
So why would you feel uncomfortable?

47:18.642 --> 47:22.344
You got your meal.
Why care what they're thinking?

47:22.522 --> 47:27.979
That they don't like you? That's just
an opinion. Why should that bother you?

47:28.153 --> 47:31.191
They're still doing their jobs.

47:33.994 --> 47:37.659
Now, what if they had guns and badges?

47:44.256 --> 47:45.715
My treat.

47:53.350 --> 47:54.761
Eat.
