What did you do to your wife?

[sighs]

00:25.984 --> 00:28.695
-She was gonna get us all killed.
-So you took care of it, huh?

00:29.780 --> 00:30.781
I tried to stop him!

00:30.864 --> 00:33.492
-Who?
-Fritz! He was hopped up on goof-berries.

00:33.784 --> 00:34.826
-[pills rattling]
-Agh!

00:34.910 --> 00:36.578
-I think I shot him.
-[Peanutbutter] Agh!

00:36.662 --> 00:39.164
What are you doing, Philbert? Oh-hh!

00:39.623 --> 00:40.874
You shot your partner?

00:40.958 --> 00:43.293
[groans] Ugh!

-Cut! We're turning around for BoJack.
-[bell ringing]

00:48.257 --> 00:50.384
All right! That was acting.

00:50.467 --> 00:53.220
Hey, so, this has been real,
but since it's our last day,

00:53.303 --> 00:56.306
it feels like maybe we should call it
on the whole us sleeping together thing.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.934
I don't usually keep dating co-stars
once we've wrapped.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.686
Would you say we're<i> co-stars?</i>

01:00.769 --> 01:04.314
I mean, I'm Philbert.
I'd say we're more like both in the cast?

01:04.398 --> 01:06.483
Yeah, let's definitely
pump the brakes on this.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.610
And we're set. Action!

01:09.027 --> 01:10.654
I had no choice.
He was strangling my wife!

01:10.737 --> 01:12.114
What did you do with the bodies?

01:12.197 --> 01:14.533
I-- It's all a blur.
It feels like a dream.

01:14.616 --> 01:17.828
-Where are the bodies, Philbert?
-I buried them.

01:17.911 --> 01:21.081
-In the same place I'm gonna bury you.
-[gasps]

01:21.415 --> 01:23.208
-Right here.
-Oh!

01:23.292 --> 01:25.794
Kiss me, you smart, handsome renegade.

01:25.877 --> 01:28.672
There's no time for that now.
The nuclear missiles are coming.

01:28.755 --> 01:32.467
Cut! That's a wrap
on<i> Philbert</i> Season One!

01:32.551 --> 01:33.510
Great work, everyone!

01:33.594 --> 01:37.472
I want you all to know
I'm proud of what I've done here.

01:37.556 --> 01:40.225
-See ya at the Peabody Awards!
-Great working with you. Thank you.

02:46.917 --> 02:49.961
-[chuckles] I love the sign.
-You better.

02:50.045 --> 02:52.381
I basically had to go
through a whole pen on that thing.

02:54.466 --> 02:56.134
-Uh...
-Hey, I'd help you with your bag,

02:56.218 --> 02:58.220
-but you know, my back.
-Yeah.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.722
It's cool that you came
through Los Angeles on your way home.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.057
Yeah, I guess we got lucky.

03:02.140 --> 03:06.478
The only flight from Connecticut to Kansas
had a one-night layover in California.

03:06.561 --> 03:09.523

-No, dummy. I wanted to see you.

That's my Emily! Send her in!

-Hey, Todd. [sighs]
-You okay?

03:23.787 --> 03:26.206
-I broke up with my fireman.
-Not Steve!

03:26.289 --> 03:28.375
No, no, no, not Steve. It was Doug.

03:28.458 --> 03:31.169
Not Doug! Forgot there was a new one!

03:31.253 --> 03:35.006
I am so done
with these sexy noble hero hunks.

03:35.090 --> 03:36.258
The sex is great,

03:36.341 --> 03:39.052
but the emotional connection
just is not there.

03:39.136 --> 03:40.846
It was the same with me and Yolanda.

03:40.929 --> 03:44.641
No emotional connection,
but the no-sex was amazing.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.560
None of the best sex I ever had.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.187
You know,
I was actually thinking about that.

03:49.271 --> 03:53.150
Remember that idea you had
about the dating app for asexuals?

03:53.233 --> 03:54.317
-Nope!

You should get yourself out there.
You were the best boyfriend I ever had.

04:02.409 --> 04:05.704
If only there was a version of you
I could have sex with, I'd be all set.

04:05.787 --> 04:10.333
-Whoa, Emily. I just got a crazy idea.
-What?

04:10.417 --> 04:14.087
A restaurant where the menus
are printed on garlic bread,

04:14.171 --> 04:18.091
so after you order,
the first course is the menu!

04:18.175 --> 04:19.217

[clock ticking]

04:24.097 --> 04:26.558
So, ever since<i> Philbert </i>wrapped
earlier today,

04:26.641 --> 04:28.810
the question on everybody's mind is,

04:28.894 --> 04:31.730
"What's Mr. Peanutbutter
going to do next?"

04:31.813 --> 04:33.190
You're a serious actor now,

04:33.273 --> 04:36.276
so I guess, narrate a documentary
about global warming,

04:36.359 --> 04:38.361
and then take a private jet
to the premiere?

04:38.445 --> 04:40.238
I've been looking for new projects.

04:40.322 --> 04:42.741
Seems like everything's based
on books these days,

04:42.824 --> 04:45.660
so I went to the book store
to scout some material.

04:45.744 --> 04:48.330
-Mm-hmm.
-But all the books are so long now.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.706
-Yeah?
-Who has the time?

04:49.790 --> 04:52.167
I'll just wait 'til the movie comes out,
then see the movie,

04:52.250 --> 04:55.295
and decide if the book the movie
is based on would make a good movie.

04:55.378 --> 04:56.671
Oh, that's a good strategy.

04:56.755 --> 05:00.091
Anyway, I was heading to the door
in book-length-related frustration...

05:00.175 --> 05:01.176
[groans]

05:01.259 --> 05:03.720
...when I saw
one of those circular greeting card racks.

05:03.804 --> 05:07.432

and it's a super-quick read.

05:07.516 --> 05:09.184

05:12.604 --> 05:15.190
You want to option this greeting card
for a movie?

05:15.273 --> 05:18.610
-We'll call it <i>Birthday Dad.</i>
-But what is it?

05:18.693 --> 05:22.489
Hmm? Mmm... it's... "Birthday Dad."

05:23.365 --> 05:24.449
Oh. Okay.

I would make a good college person.

to drug you with secret pills. All right?

Now, how about we make new, fun, memories
to cancel out the old ones?

must be a big night for you.

to a nice dinner with your new girlfriend?

06:39.524 --> 06:41.902
Or seeing a movie
with your new<i> girlfriend?</i>

06:41.985 --> 06:43.945
Or staying in and watching cable--

06:44.029 --> 06:47.157
I get what you're asking. The answer is,
no, I don't have cable anymore.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.158
Oh! [chuckles]

06:48.241 --> 06:49.242
Or a new girlfriend.

06:50.243 --> 06:53.496

I've just been so busy with my<i> Philbert.</i>

but never had.

-Thought you could help me brainstorm.
-Okay. What kind of things does she like?

Well, sex, for one.

to know her body.

because of the time I overdosed on pills.

I'm not "doing drugs." This was medicine.

10:18.576 --> 10:19.494
Can you get more?

10:19.577 --> 10:21.496
Oh, sure.
I'll just call the pharmacy and say,

10:21.579 --> 10:23.456
"Hey, girl, you know
that highly-addictive opioid

10:23.540 --> 10:26.459
I'm supposed to take every three hours?
Well, I kind of misplaced them,

10:26.543 --> 10:29.754
so could I just get some more?
I'm totally not a drug addict."

10:29.838 --> 10:31.840
-I'm really sorry.
-No. It's fine.

10:31.923 --> 10:34.509
Let's enjoy our time together,
even though I'm in tremendous pain.

10:34.592 --> 10:35.510
I'll try to forget it,

10:35.593 --> 10:37.804
but the whole time
we might be thinking about it.

10:37.887 --> 10:40.473
I do not blame you, but if you
blame yourself, that is okay with me.

10:40.557 --> 10:43.434
You must know a place
you can get more painkillers.

10:43.518 --> 10:44.352
I do know a guy,

10:44.435 --> 10:46.813
but he's somewhat "south of Pico,"
if you know what I mean.

10:46.896 --> 10:49.149
I don't. Why do Los Angeles people think

10:49.232 --> 10:51.943
everyone else understands
your local references?

10:52.026 --> 10:53.319
Okay, okay, let's go.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.740
I can't believe you're adopting.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.617
I just realized
it was the right thing for me.

10:59.701 --> 11:03.288
I just remember you were so adamant
about having the baby yourself,

11:03.371 --> 11:05.999
even when I said we should talk
about other options.

11:06.082 --> 11:07.834
-Yeah, but the way you said it--
-I'm not mad.

11:07.917 --> 11:11.045
I just think it's funny you had
that change of heart <i>after </i>we broke up.

11:11.129 --> 11:12.463
[sighs]

11:12.547 --> 11:15.425
[sighs] I'm sorry. This is not about me.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.760
You'll be a great mom,
and I'm really happy for you.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.470
-Yeah?
-Of course.

11:19.554 --> 11:21.973
Well, one day,
you're gonna be a great dad.

11:22.056 --> 11:24.767
-Hopefully as cool as Birthday Dad!
[chuckles]

11:27.562 --> 11:29.814
-Why are we at the pediatrician?
-Trust me.

11:29.898 --> 11:34.027
This doctor is the sleaziest, dopiest,
scurviest of the scurvy.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.945
-Who is he?
-Exactly.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.615
-[Hollyhock yelps]
-Hu... wants to par-tay?

11:38.698 --> 11:40.867
Dr. Hu! Thank you for squeezing us in!

11:40.950 --> 11:42.994
You always gotta make time
for your friends.

11:43.077 --> 11:45.371
And I haven't seen you
since Sarah Lynn's funeral.

11:45.455 --> 11:46.331
Oh, right.

11:46.414 --> 11:49.375
That was a huge wake-up call for me.

11:49.459 --> 11:53.213
Next morning I looked in the mirror,
and you know who I saw staring back at me?

11:53.296 --> 11:54.422
-[Hollyhock] Who?
-Exactly.

11:54.505 --> 11:55.423
-What?
-No. Hu.

11:55.506 --> 11:59.135
I spent 30 days at Pastiches Malibu
and now I'm sober.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.722
It's like I completely regenerated
as a brand-new doctor.

12:02.805 --> 12:03.723
Congratulations.

12:03.806 --> 12:06.726
You'd have to be a real lost cause
not to seek help

12:06.809 --> 12:08.937
after losing Sarah Lynn like that,
don't you think?

12:09.020 --> 12:10.813
Oh, deffo. I mean, you know, get help

12:10.897 --> 12:13.149
or, you know,
work out a system on your own.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.068
Even, you know, whatever's right for you.

12:15.151 --> 12:17.862
Anyway, I'm trying to get my hands
on some Feelbetterin?

12:17.946 --> 12:18.780
Feelbetterin?

12:18.863 --> 12:21.366
BoJack, have you been taking
oxypraxylcortizoid?

12:21.449 --> 12:24.577
Yeah. I know what you're thinking,
but I legitimately have a herniated disc.

12:24.661 --> 12:25.703
He's telling the truth!

12:25.787 --> 12:29.415
I threw out his pills because of my trauma
from when I got drugged by his mama.

12:29.499 --> 12:31.876
-You got drugged by your own mother?
-No, my mother.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.295
Her mother was a maid
who got knocked up by my dad,

12:34.379 --> 12:36.464
but she got adopted by eight other dads.

12:36.547 --> 12:39.676
Okay, do you know how many times
I hear this story every week?

12:39.759 --> 12:41.928
This story, specifically?
Even the "eight dads" part?

12:42.011 --> 12:46.599
I don't know who you think you're fooling,
but this Hu won't get fooled again.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.062
Thank you for coming, Emily.

12:51.145 --> 12:54.983
What's with all the candles?
Why are you wearing a robe?

12:55.066 --> 12:58.528
Oh, I blew a fuse earlier,
so I had to light candles.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.780
That took a while,
and then I didn't get to change.

13:00.863 --> 13:02.865
-Oh.
-Hold that thought.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.784
-The thought of "Oh"?
-That's right.

13:04.867 --> 13:08.037
Because you're gonna need it
when you meet your new best friend...

13:08.121 --> 13:09.706
-Uh...
-[grunts]

13:09.789 --> 13:11.874
-Whoa!
-Henry Fondle!

13:11.958 --> 13:12.792
[robot screaching]

13:12.875 --> 13:15.169
-What? What?
-He's a sex robot!

13:15.253 --> 13:18.756
So, you can stop dating
all those boring guys and still have sex!

13:18.840 --> 13:22.093
-Stop me if you've heard this one. What?
-And guess what?

13:22.176 --> 13:25.054
I even recorded dozens
of sexy robot phrases

13:25.138 --> 13:27.098
-for it to say at random intervals!
-[clicks]

13:27.181 --> 13:30.435
[robot] <i>I am Henry Fondle.</i>
<i>Insert me into genitals!</i>

13:30.518 --> 13:33.813
-Why did you do this?
-To show you that I care about your needs.

13:33.896 --> 13:36.357
[robot] <i>My prime directive</i>
<i>is to pleasure you.</i>

13:36.524 --> 13:39.902
Todd, I'm not sure you understand
how sex works.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.363
That is so condescending.

13:42.447 --> 13:45.116
I know what sex is. I am not a child.

13:45.199 --> 13:47.577
I'm just not great at building robots.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.079
This is my first one, and frankly,

13:50.163 --> 13:53.458
I think it's pretty impressive
I put it together in one afternoon.

13:53.541 --> 13:56.127
<i>I love it when you call me "Father."</i>

13:56.210 --> 13:57.211
-[clatters]
-[both gasp]

13:57.295 --> 14:00.882
Oh, no!
My wacky scheme backfired as always!

14:03.134 --> 14:05.136
-I'm really sorry.
-It's fine.

14:05.219 --> 14:07.430
We're spending time together,
that's all that matters.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.557
You're not super-mad at me, still?

14:09.640 --> 14:11.893
When this is done,
maybe it'll make a great story

14:11.976 --> 14:13.853
you can tell that kid you have a crush on.

14:13.936 --> 14:16.606
Who, Joby? [chuckles]
I don't have a crush on him.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.650
Get out of here.
His jawline is, like, dumb.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.611
-Oh, okay.
-Where are we going now?

14:21.694 --> 14:25.031
There's this actress I was kind of seeing
while we were working together

14:25.114 --> 14:26.949
and I might have left some pills
at her place.

14:27.033 --> 14:30.411
She made it clear she doesn't want
to see me again but she's not home now.

14:30.495 --> 14:32.622
-Why do I know Gina's schedule?
-Where is she?

14:32.705 --> 14:36.334
She has a book club with dumb Nicole
who keeps picking very long Italian books

14:36.417 --> 14:39.754
that Nicole doesn't even read.
Why do I know about Gina's friends?

14:39.837 --> 14:42.173
-Do you have a key?
-I have my ways.

14:44.092 --> 14:46.010
-Well, I'm out of ways.
-I'll go around back

14:46.094 --> 14:47.929
and see if there's a window
I can climb through.

14:48.012 --> 14:49.931
Ooh, good thinking! I'll stand guard.

14:50.264 --> 14:51.974
[winces] Ugh.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.060
Oh, shit.

14:54.435 --> 14:55.269
BoJack?

14:55.353 --> 14:57.355
Oh, my God! What happened to book club?

14:57.438 --> 14:59.524
We switched it to Thursdays
to confuse Nicole.

14:59.607 --> 15:03.194
-Why are you here?
-I just wanted to check on you.

15:03.569 --> 15:04.404
[Gina sighs]

15:05.571 --> 15:06.447
[gasps]

15:06.781 --> 15:09.283
-[gasps]
-Wait, Gina. No, stay outside.

15:09.367 --> 15:11.536
I just-- I need to talk to you.

15:11.786 --> 15:12.662
Slowly.

15:12.787 --> 15:15.206
Is this about our relationship?
What is there to talk about?

15:15.289 --> 15:16.958
Well, I just been thinking that...

15:17.041 --> 15:20.711
we should<i> keep looking</i>
at this relationship.

15:20.795 --> 15:23.047
Like<i> all</i> parts of this relationship.

15:23.131 --> 15:26.759
Like even in the <i>junk drawer,</i>
<i>in the kitchen </i>of this relationship.

15:26.843 --> 15:30.638
-Or <i>the bathroom cabinet.</i>
-I told you I didn't want to see you.

15:30.721 --> 15:33.182
I want you to know
that you are top-shelf, Gina.

15:33.266 --> 15:37.145
-Know what I mean? <i>Top shelf.</i>
-So, what, you wanna get back together?

15:37.228 --> 15:38.396
-Eh...?
-Yes!

15:38.479 --> 15:39.480
Wait, really?

15:39.564 --> 15:40.815
-Okay, I gotta run.
-BoJack.

15:40.898 --> 15:44.694
I have had 28 on-set flings,
and no guy has ever come to my house

15:44.777 --> 15:47.155
after shooting was over to try
to have a real relationship.

15:47.238 --> 15:49.407
-Well...
-I guess I sort of internalized the idea

15:49.490 --> 15:50.575
I didn't deserve that?

15:50.658 --> 15:52.285
Yeah, but like I said, I really gotta run.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.954
But maybe I do deserve it.
Maybe we both do.

15:55.037 --> 15:58.040
BoJack, is it possible that we're the ones
we've been waiting for?

15:58.124 --> 16:00.793
Uh, yes. I totally think that is possible,

16:00.877 --> 16:03.004
which is why I can't wait
to talk about this tomorrow!

16:03.087 --> 16:05.173
-What? Where are you going?
-I'll call you!

16:05.756 --> 16:07.842
[Hollyhock panting] Whoa!

16:08.134 --> 16:10.428
Think I need to call her,
or did I leave things open enough

16:10.511 --> 16:12.138
-where I can kinda ghost?
-What?

16:12.221 --> 16:15.141
Kidding! I'll call her.
I'm very fond of that woman.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.101
And I'm sure
that things are gonna work out fine,

16:17.185 --> 16:19.854
and we can find a way to be happy together
and I won't hurt her

16:19.937 --> 16:22.315
in a way that she carries with her
for the rest of her life.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.609
-Uh, okay.
-Lemme get them pills.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.820
-What the hell? These aren't my pills!
-Sorry!

16:27.904 --> 16:30.990
-Not your fault. It's just... my back.

16:31.073 --> 16:33.159
-I got another idea.
-Okay.

16:33.534 --> 16:38.122
-Do you think Gina needed those?
-She'll be fine. Nobody<i> needs</i> pills.

16:40.750 --> 16:43.127
-You could've just dropped me off.
-I wanted to be here.

16:43.211 --> 16:45.880
-Hope that's okay.
-It's actually nice you're here.

16:45.963 --> 16:48.633
All the times I imagined us
taking home a baby from the hospital,

16:48.716 --> 16:50.009
I never pictured it like this.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.470
You mean, you never pictured
it would happen on a Friday?

16:52.553 --> 16:55.515
[laughs] Yeah, exactly.
That's the main difference.

16:56.390 --> 17:00.269
[sighs] How come you never called me
after I kicked you out of my apartment?

17:00.353 --> 17:02.772
You were so mad at me.
I didn't think you wanted me to.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.483
I didn't.
But you still should have called.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.944
-Well, you could have called me.
-Yeah.

17:08.277 --> 17:11.447
-I wish you'd stayed with me that night.
-You told me to leave.

17:11.531 --> 17:14.659
Yeah. I guess the lesson is,
don't listen to me, right?

17:14.742 --> 17:16.244
[Ralph chuckles] Mm-hmm.

17:16.327 --> 17:19.664
Is that really what you're gonna wear
for the first time your new baby sees you?

17:19.747 --> 17:22.625
-Yes?
-Oof! Okay.

17:25.920 --> 17:29.048
I'm supposed to be back
at the airport in, like, two hours.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.175
Is this really
how you want to spend this time?

17:31.259 --> 17:33.844
Again, and... [chuckles]
I hate to keep harping on this,

17:33.928 --> 17:36.597
we wouldn't be here
if someone hadn't dumped my medicine.

17:36.681 --> 17:39.475
I know, but this place is super sketchy.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.436
It looks like
where they did the drag race in<i> Grease.</i>

17:42.520 --> 17:44.397
It <i>is </i>where they did the drag race
in<i> Grease.</i>

17:44.480 --> 17:46.732
-Where do you think they make movies?
-Ooh!

17:47.191 --> 17:48.526
-[Hollyhock yelps]
-[tires screech]

17:48.818 --> 17:51.571
-You a cop?
-What? No. Oh, shit.

17:51.654 --> 17:54.115
No, it's a costume.
I just finished filming a show.

17:54.198 --> 17:57.201
Normally, people return the costume.

17:57.285 --> 18:00.204
Hello, drug merchant.
Is it<i> lit</i> under here?

18:00.288 --> 18:01.122
What?

18:01.205 --> 18:03.791
Are there illegal pharmaceuticals
available for purchase?

18:03.874 --> 18:05.710
And please, talk into my lollipop.

18:05.793 --> 18:08.588
-Okay, this guy's a cop.
-I assure you I am not.

18:08.671 --> 18:11.424
He's just saying that
because earlier I said he was a cop.

18:11.507 --> 18:14.969
No. You can see the outline of his badge
under his tee-shirt!

18:15.052 --> 18:18.556
-Yeah, no, he's definitely a cop.
-Seems cool to me.

18:18.639 --> 18:20.266
Listen. If I were a cop,

18:20.349 --> 18:21.642
I'd have pancake breath

18:21.726 --> 18:24.353
from the precinct's
weekly Friday night pancake dinners.

18:24.437 --> 18:27.773
-But I do not. So clearly, not a cop.
-Uh...

18:27.857 --> 18:31.569
Unless, I somehow had an Altoid,
or a Tic-Tac after,

18:31.652 --> 18:35.031
which again, no.
[chuckles] I am a gum guy.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.325
That all tracks for me.
Here are your drugs.

18:37.408 --> 18:39.243
-Aha! We got the package!
-Whoa!

18:39.327 --> 18:41.162
-[tires screech, siren wails]
-[BoJack] Run!

18:41.245 --> 18:42.872
-[Hollyhock gasps]
-They're getting away!

18:42.955 --> 18:44.957
-Go, go, go!
-[siren wails]

18:47.126 --> 18:48.628
-[BoJack panting]
-[Hollyhock moans]

18:48.711 --> 18:50.046
-[Hollyhock] Oh, no!
-Here, get up.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.297
[both grunting]

18:52.548 --> 18:53.382
[grunts]

18:54.759 --> 18:57.011
-Eh...?
-Come on! We have to keep moving!

18:57.094 --> 18:58.471
[groans]

18:59.305 --> 19:01.515
-[hissing]
-[Emily] Ooh!

19:01.599 --> 19:03.351
-Thanks, Doug.
-I'm not here for you.

19:03.434 --> 19:06.354
I'm here because I respect the art
of putting out fires. [puffs]

19:06.437 --> 19:09.231
- I'm really sorry, Emily.
-It was a sweet idea.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.734
I guess I just thought
you waste so much time

19:11.817 --> 19:14.195
with these boring firemen
just for the sex.

19:14.278 --> 19:16.155
-Eh?
-Doug, some privacy, please?

19:16.238 --> 19:17.156
Okay.

19:17.239 --> 19:21.202
Maybe I figured if you had some other way
to satisfy yourself sexually,

19:21.285 --> 19:23.913
then you could spend more time with me.

19:23.996 --> 19:27.249
-Like we did in high school.
-Todd, we were dating in high school.

19:27.333 --> 19:30.795
Do you ever think about
what it would be like if we dated now?

19:31.003 --> 19:33.506
I don't know. What would it be like?

19:33.589 --> 19:35.883
I guess we'd hang out together,
like we already do.

19:35.966 --> 19:38.761
And you would be my favorite person,
like you already are.

19:38.844 --> 19:42.682
And when something good happened to me,
like if I got a promotion at work,

19:42.765 --> 19:44.809
you'd be the first person I'd tell,

19:44.892 --> 19:48.312
and you'd smile and say,
"That's my boyfriend."

19:48.396 --> 19:51.774
Well, that could be cool.
But then I would have sex with the robot?

19:51.899 --> 19:53.776
[whirring] <i>Boop, boop, boop! Oh!</i>

19:53.859 --> 19:55.319
-[splatters]
-[sighs] Uh-hh!

19:55.403 --> 19:57.613
<i>-Hooray.</i>
-I guess it's not ideal.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.324
You know,
when I was putting the app together,

20:00.408 --> 20:03.619
I learned that some asexuals
actually <i>do </i>have sex.

20:03.703 --> 20:07.915
-Do you... think that there's a chance?
-[mutters] Um-umm.

20:07.998 --> 20:12.461
-Okay. Well, you got any other ideas?
-Hmm.

20:13.003 --> 20:17.800
What about if marbles were cube-shaped,
so they don't roll away as much?

20:18.551 --> 20:20.344
-No dice.
-[sighs]

20:22.763 --> 20:24.807
[Princess Carolyn] Oh, he's beautiful.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.768
Do you think I'm terrible
for giving him away?

20:27.852 --> 20:29.353
What? Of course not.

20:29.437 --> 20:31.355
I don't know the first thing
about being a parent.

20:31.439 --> 20:33.816
-Bridget, it's okay.
-Your baby's in excellent hands.

20:33.899 --> 20:36.277
I'm just so glad he's going
to a good home,

20:36.360 --> 20:38.738
-with a mother and a father.
-What's this, now?

20:38.821 --> 20:42.491
I mean, if my boyfriend was still
in the picture, maybe I could be a parent,

20:42.575 --> 20:46.162
but as is, I think the baby's
probably better off with you two.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.830
-Oh, no, Ralph's not--
-That's right!

20:47.913 --> 20:49.957
We're gonna make
a wonderful family together.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.501
-Ralph, don't lie to her.
-I'm not lying.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.712
A year ago, we wanted to have
a family together.

20:54.795 --> 20:57.465
-I still want that.
-Ralph, no. You should go.

20:57.548 --> 21:00.217
I hear you say that, but I'm not making
the mistake I made last time.

21:00.301 --> 21:01.177
I don't want this.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.471
This seems like a subject
you should have agreed on

21:03.554 --> 21:05.097
before you came to the hospital.

21:05.181 --> 21:07.266
We can do this. Nothing has changed.

21:07.349 --> 21:10.394
I changed! I have plans now,
and you're not in them.

21:10.478 --> 21:14.356
-You don't need to do this by yourself.
-I never needed to. I <i>want </i>to.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.358
I'm not afraid of how hard it's gonna be.

21:16.442 --> 21:21.363
I already love this baby.
And that gives me so much power.

21:21.447 --> 21:23.240
I don't need anything else.

21:23.324 --> 21:25.951
Oh, my God, I just realized something.

21:26.035 --> 21:29.747
If you can do it by yourself,
maybe that means I can do it by myself.

21:29.830 --> 21:32.291
-Uh...
-No, no, Bridget, you definitely can't.

21:32.374 --> 21:36.378
I thought I couldn't.
But that speech you gave was so inspiring.

21:36.462 --> 21:40.549
It made me realize that all I need
to be a good mother is love.

21:40.633 --> 21:44.762
Actually, you need <i>so </i>much more than that.
I was wrong when I said that a second ago.

21:45.554 --> 21:49.099
[chuckles] Okay. But for real,
give me my baby boy.

21:49.183 --> 21:51.101
-[moans] Oh-hh...
-Coochie-coochie-choo...

21:51.185 --> 21:54.230
-[moans]
-Princess Carolyn, you are amazing.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.690
-Can you be <i>my </i>mom?
-[groans] Oh-hh!

21:57.316 --> 21:59.819
[both panting]

22:00.110 --> 22:03.197
[coughing]
There's gotta be another way to get pills.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.741
How about calling this Joby?
He sounds like a druggie.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.868
-I thought your back hurts.
-Yeah.

22:07.952 --> 22:11.622
-How did you lift me over the fence?
-Well, the adrenaline kicked in.

22:11.705 --> 22:14.542
-Do you <i>really </i>need these pills?
-Hollyhock, how many times--

22:14.625 --> 22:16.836
I'm just saying,
is it possible maybe you don't--

22:16.919 --> 22:20.214
Okay. You go to college
and suddenly you're so sophisticated,

22:20.297 --> 22:22.591
-and I'm a dumb junkie, is that it?
-What? No!

22:22.675 --> 22:23.843
You don't understand anything!

22:23.926 --> 22:26.303
-I am in pain.
-No, I get that.

22:26.387 --> 22:28.472
All the time. my whole life.
And you have no idea.

22:28.556 --> 22:31.016
So, sorry that you had one bad experience
with my mom,

22:31.100 --> 22:34.645
but I have been in pain my whole life.

22:34.728 --> 22:35.604
[sighs]

22:37.231 --> 22:39.692
I think you should take me to the airport.

22:40.359 --> 22:41.193
Okay.

22:46.824 --> 22:49.410
-You're sure I can't drive you home?
-No, Ralph.

22:49.785 --> 22:51.871
Can I at least wait with you for the cab?

22:52.246 --> 22:54.331
[sighs] Okay.

23:01.130 --> 23:02.047
[buckle clicks]

23:04.884 --> 23:07.261
So, I guess I'll see you later.

23:07.344 --> 23:10.389
-Hollyhock, I'm sorry.
-Me, too.

23:10.472 --> 23:13.434
Maybe, it's possible that I don't...

23:13.934 --> 23:17.605
100-percent need-need the pills.

23:17.688 --> 23:19.648
I thought I did, but-- yeah.

23:19.732 --> 23:22.860
So, thank you for... caring about me.

23:22.943 --> 23:25.279
-Are you gonna be okay?
-Yeah.

23:25.362 --> 23:27.781
I could take a semester off,
if you need someone--

23:27.865 --> 23:31.577
No. God, no. Stay... stay in school.

23:31.660 --> 23:35.581
And take your classes, and kiss boys,
and do the college thing.

23:35.873 --> 23:38.375
I'm gonna be fine.
I get it. Drugs are bad.

23:38.459 --> 23:40.127
Not all drugs.

23:40.210 --> 23:43.672
Obviously, if you get hurt again,
and a doctor, a real doctor

23:43.756 --> 23:46.216
prescribes you painkillers,
you can take them.

23:46.300 --> 23:48.802
-But only if you get hurt again.
-Okay.

23:48.886 --> 23:51.430
-You promise?
-Yes. I promise.

23:51.513 --> 23:54.058
Okay. I love you.

23:54.141 --> 23:55.851
[sighs] Hmm.

23:57.353 --> 23:59.980
Okay. Bye.

24:12.868 --> 24:14.536
[whirring]

24:15.037 --> 24:17.122
[clicks, beeping]

24:22.127 --> 24:23.379
[sighs]

24:28.634 --> 24:29.551
[sighs] Whew.

24:29.677 --> 24:31.679
[traffic noises]

24:34.223 --> 24:35.349
[hatch clicks]

24:40.854 --> 24:41.689
Ugh!

24:45.067 --> 24:46.568
[panting]

24:49.029 --> 24:49.863
Uh...

24:50.572 --> 24:51.740
[groaning]

24:52.408 --> 24:53.659
-[groaning]
-[tires screech]

24:53.742 --> 24:55.202
[crashing]
