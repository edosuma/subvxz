03:42.825 --> 03:44.625
This is control,
what's your sit rep?

03:44.627 --> 03:46.359
Come back.

03:46.361 --> 03:47.193
Sorry sir, caught a tiger.

03:47.195 --> 03:48.194
He's
tracking you now?

03:48.196 --> 03:49.263
I don't know sir, I
gotta get out of here.

03:49.265 --> 03:50.865
Stop where
you are and count to five.

03:50.867 --> 03:52.265
Negative, sir.

03:52.267 --> 03:54.401
Do it now,
18, that's an order.

03:54.403 --> 03:55.235
One,

03:55.237 --> 03:55.870
two,

03:55.872 --> 03:56.904
three,

03:56.906 --> 03:57.707
four,

03:58.974 --> 04:00.307
five.

04:00.309 --> 04:01.474
You still there, 18?

04:01.476 --> 04:02.742
I think so, sir.

04:02.744 --> 04:04.478
Then he's
not tracking you.

04:04.480 --> 04:05.812
How can you tell?

04:05.814 --> 04:09.317
You got
to five, didn't you?

05:00.837 --> 05:02.402
What you doing?

05:02.404 --> 05:03.970
Shouldn't you be in bed by now?

05:03.972 --> 05:06.306
No, our bedtime
ain't till 10:00.

05:06.308 --> 05:07.508
10:00?

05:07.510 --> 05:08.743
That's outrageous.

05:08.745 --> 05:11.611
I was never allowed to stay up
till 10 when I was your age.

05:11.613 --> 05:12.813
What a cock.

05:53.823 --> 05:54.688
Nine million.

05:54.690 --> 05:57.758
No no
no, let me speak.

05:57.760 --> 05:59.727
Nine million.

06:03.565 --> 06:07.100
We meet only
once every 50 years, Peter,

06:07.102 --> 06:09.636
and you've striven
to become a bore.

06:09.638 --> 06:10.905
10 million.

06:10.907 --> 06:13.708
And I cherish each
and every one of them.

06:13.710 --> 06:15.876
I'm just
stating the facts here.

06:15.878 --> 06:17.010
As you see them.

06:17.012 --> 06:18.611
As they are.

06:18.613 --> 06:20.414
Nine million.

06:20.416 --> 06:23.083
10 million, four
million, eight million.

06:23.085 --> 06:25.785
Now take away the first
two numbers you thought of

06:25.787 --> 06:27.688
and add seven.

06:27.690 --> 06:29.623
Two and a half million.

06:29.625 --> 06:30.494
Huh?

06:31.727 --> 06:33.828
He doesn't even feed.

06:33.830 --> 06:35.095
Is that why you
think it's okay

06:35.097 --> 06:36.996
to keep poaching
on my territory?

06:36.998 --> 06:39.999
For the fifth and
final time, Henry,

06:40.001 --> 06:42.770
north of the border's
my territory.

06:42.772 --> 06:45.405
And I'm not Erica Von
Tweed, Mr. Boniface.

06:45.407 --> 06:46.909
Gentlemen, please.

06:48.411 --> 06:52.716
One squabble at a time, and I
believe I have the rank here.

06:53.883 --> 06:56.015
60 million and counting.

06:56.017 --> 06:59.085
Yet I remember when
it was just six,

06:59.087 --> 07:02.989
and we were eight then,
and we're eight now.

07:02.991 --> 07:05.025
Thinking of breeding,
are you Peter?

07:05.027 --> 07:06.460
No.

07:06.462 --> 07:07.727
No, I'm quite happy with
the friends I've got,

07:07.729 --> 07:08.696
thank you very much.

07:08.698 --> 07:10.597
And so am I.

07:10.599 --> 07:14.535
But I rather not be stuck
here with all of you tomorrow.

07:14.537 --> 07:18.974
If you don't mind, please,
could we get to the point?

07:21.611 --> 07:22.712
Courthouse.

07:23.813 --> 07:25.845
And so it wasn't
even us it who pushed her

07:25.847 --> 07:28.883
into the pond, yet we were the
ones who got told off for it,

07:28.885 --> 07:30.484
and she was already
climbing out.

07:30.486 --> 07:32.421
Plus she's our new rep.

07:33.890 --> 07:35.188
That's good.

07:35.190 --> 07:37.191
Give us a quid.

07:37.193 --> 07:38.659
Ain't your parents
ever told you

07:38.661 --> 07:40.527
about talking to strangers?

07:40.529 --> 07:42.996
Ain't yours?

07:42.998 --> 07:44.164
I never even knew 'em, mate.

07:44.166 --> 07:45.498
I'm an orphan.

07:45.500 --> 07:46.934
My dad's in Afghanistan.

07:46.936 --> 07:48.003
Ah.

07:51.440 --> 07:52.476
Here you go.

07:54.176 --> 07:56.176
In the army then,
is he, your dad?

07:56.178 --> 07:57.111
No.

07:57.113 --> 07:58.546
The Taliban.

07:58.548 --> 08:00.147
Wait, give me that
quid back, you little!

08:06.556 --> 08:08.621
Oh, about time.

08:08.623 --> 08:11.962
Here you are, you
have the rest of that.

08:18.868 --> 08:20.066
Not late, am I?

08:20.068 --> 08:21.170
Just in time.

08:22.572 --> 08:23.604
You smell lovely.

08:23.606 --> 08:24.737
Mmm.

08:24.739 --> 08:26.041
And you smell of booze.

08:27.210 --> 08:31.512
Just a couple with the
lads while I was waiting.

08:31.514 --> 08:33.013
So how far's this place, then?

08:33.015 --> 08:33.884
Not far.

08:40.255 --> 08:41.955
Nice car.

08:41.957 --> 08:43.090
Nice looking bird.

08:43.092 --> 08:44.959
Oh yeah.

08:50.665 --> 08:53.099
You have your rightful orders.

08:53.101 --> 08:55.668
That's not enough.

08:55.670 --> 08:58.174
I'll speak with the
European council again.

08:59.241 --> 09:01.508
But you know what they will say.

09:01.510 --> 09:02.909
Fuck the council.

09:02.911 --> 09:04.811
I say we set our own quarters.

09:04.813 --> 09:06.046
And cut our own throats.

09:06.048 --> 09:08.215
They will hunt us
down and you know it.

09:08.217 --> 09:11.185
These are difficult
times,

09:11.187 --> 09:13.190
for all of us.

09:13.823 --> 09:16.523
Our glory days are long gone.

09:16.525 --> 09:18.893
Difficult times?

09:18.895 --> 09:20.527
Yeah but only for us.

09:20.529 --> 09:22.061
Because I know what
they're taking over there,

09:22.063 --> 09:23.730
and it's a hell of a lot more

09:23.732 --> 09:25.199
than what we're
taking over here.

09:25.201 --> 09:27.637
We are an island race, Peter.

09:28.871 --> 09:31.607
Therefore we must
tread more carefully.

09:32.174 --> 09:35.542
And this has its
pros and its cons.

09:35.544 --> 09:37.210
Yeah, and the pros are?

09:37.212 --> 09:39.146
The population's skyrocketing.

09:39.148 --> 09:41.648
So is their technology.

09:41.650 --> 09:45.018
And all records,
computer files, DNA.

09:45.020 --> 09:47.120
We're not talking Bo
Street runs anymore.

09:47.122 --> 09:48.656
Come on.

09:48.658 --> 09:50.925
All those migrants
coming in clinging

09:50.927 --> 09:52.993
to the undersides of vehicles.

09:52.995 --> 09:54.862
No one's going to
miss a few of them.

09:55.765 --> 09:57.031
Been reading the
Daily Mail again, Alice?

09:57.033 --> 10:00.003
Those migrants may not be as
invisible as you might think.

10:01.069 --> 10:03.202
They're harvesting our crops,
they're sweeping our streets.

10:03.204 --> 10:04.640
They're emptying the bins.

10:05.775 --> 10:08.142
And they're sending the
money home to their families

10:08.144 --> 10:10.009
so that maybe just
maybe they can join us

10:10.011 --> 10:11.814
here in the promised land.

10:12.881 --> 10:14.047
Whether we like it or
not, they have become

10:14.049 --> 10:18.252
part of the fabric of this
society, and they will be missed

10:18.254 --> 10:20.156
if we think we can
start helping ourselves.

10:20.823 --> 10:23.090
Not by my friends at
the bingo they won't be.

10:23.092 --> 10:25.124
Just wait till your
friends are lying

10:25.126 --> 10:27.094
in their hospital
beds at death's door

10:27.096 --> 10:29.028
needing their backsides wiped.

10:29.030 --> 10:31.098
I suspect it
won't come to that

10:31.100 --> 10:33.700
for most of my dear old friends.

10:33.702 --> 10:36.070
I don't like 'em over 60.

10:36.072 --> 10:38.605
It's too gamey for my taste.

10:38.607 --> 10:39.840
Hey.

10:39.842 --> 10:42.075
What are we even
talking about here?

10:42.077 --> 10:43.744
I'm not racist.

10:43.746 --> 10:46.213
I'll kill anyone, no
matter where they're from.

10:46.215 --> 10:47.317
Doesn't bother me.

11:02.698 --> 11:03.567
Come on.

11:07.269 --> 11:09.105
So that's what you've
been up to, is it?

11:10.206 --> 11:11.904
Helping yourself.

11:11.906 --> 11:13.273
Oh yeah.

11:13.275 --> 11:14.744
Oh, you'd like
that, wouldn't you?

11:15.343 --> 11:18.878
Get a sanction off the
council to get rid of me.

11:18.880 --> 11:21.584
I'm not talking to you, Peter.

11:22.183 --> 11:23.252
What?

11:24.220 --> 11:25.088
What?

11:30.192 --> 11:31.061
What?

11:33.261 --> 11:36.265
You think we wouldn't
find out, Thomas?

11:38.266 --> 11:41.034
That the council
wouldn't find out?

11:41.036 --> 11:42.136
What's
he talking about?

11:42.138 --> 11:43.336
I dunno.

11:43.338 --> 11:45.305
He's been overfeeding.

11:45.307 --> 11:46.205
No I haven't.

11:46.207 --> 11:49.980
16 above his quota
this year already.

11:51.079 --> 11:53.346
And the less said about
last year the better.

11:53.348 --> 11:54.248
That's a lie.

11:54.250 --> 11:57.754
And not only has
he been overfeeding,

11:59.321 --> 12:00.957
he's been taking them young.

12:07.228 --> 12:08.995
The little boy in the paper?

12:08.997 --> 12:10.265
Boys, plural.

12:13.169 --> 12:14.404
That wasn't me.

12:15.804 --> 12:17.738
I didn't take them, honest.

12:17.740 --> 12:18.408
I swear.

12:22.712 --> 12:25.148
What have you done?

12:26.314 --> 12:29.082
You're always saying
we should take what we want.

12:29.084 --> 12:30.886
Yeah, not children,

12:32.087 --> 12:34.723
not like this, not
without consent.

12:36.257 --> 12:37.893
But...

12:38.494 --> 12:39.896
you said.

12:42.497 --> 12:43.799
And you.

12:44.265 --> 12:45.367
No, Tom.

12:51.307 --> 12:52.342
Please.

12:55.244 --> 12:57.180
I can stick to my quota.

12:58.880 --> 13:01.150
I won't let you down again.

13:04.452 --> 13:07.387
If only it were that simple.

13:16.799 --> 13:17.531
Let me go!

13:17.533 --> 13:18.331
This isn't right.

13:18.333 --> 13:19.867
No, but it's official.

13:19.869 --> 13:21.902
Do it quickly, finish this.

13:21.904 --> 13:23.202
No, Henry!

13:24.405 --> 13:25.104
Peter, don't do
this Henry, please!

13:25.106 --> 13:27.007
You brought it on yourself.

13:39.954 --> 13:42.855
When fires
die and shoals combust,

13:42.857 --> 13:46.962
the blood recedes
to leave but dust.

13:49.832 --> 13:51.165
And that's that.

14:16.858 --> 14:19.528
This ain't nothing
kinky, is it?

14:21.563 --> 14:23.232
Describe kinky.

14:24.366 --> 14:29.338
Well, I'm not looking
to cross the streams.

14:30.305 --> 14:31.473
Do you know what I mean?

14:33.576 --> 14:35.411
Not entirely, no.

14:36.477 --> 14:40.214
Well, I'm just saying,
you know I like you.

14:40.216 --> 14:41.417
And I like you too.

14:42.318 --> 14:45.085
And I'm sure my
friend's gonna like you.

14:45.087 --> 14:48.357
I just, I thought
when you asked that

14:49.457 --> 14:51.892
it'd be just the
two of us, you know?

14:53.129 --> 14:57.864
Aren't you the cutest little
thing when you're being shy?

14:57.866 --> 14:59.334
Slightly patronizing.

15:01.370 --> 15:02.438
But okay.

15:03.271 --> 15:05.172
We won't stay up too late.

15:05.174 --> 15:08.443
We'll have a quick bite and
then off to bed, I promise.

15:08.644 --> 15:11.077
I can live with that.

15:11.079 --> 15:12.114
We'll see.

15:33.068 --> 15:34.234
Everybody here?

15:34.236 --> 15:35.404
Everybody was.

15:36.472 --> 15:37.671
This is Sebastian.

15:37.673 --> 15:40.974
Hey Sebastian, glad
you could make it.

15:40.976 --> 15:43.676
You took the
words right out my mouth, mate.

15:43.678 --> 15:44.912
Go on inside.

15:44.914 --> 15:47.183
Everyone's waiting for you.

15:53.489 --> 15:55.489
He's got my bag.

15:55.491 --> 15:56.491
Sebastian.

15:59.227 --> 16:00.295
For fucks sake.

16:01.329 --> 16:02.198
Come on.

16:10.371 --> 16:11.373
Hi everyone.

16:13.275 --> 16:14.244
Not too late, am I?

16:17.279 --> 16:18.147
No.

16:19.213 --> 16:21.650
Your timing couldn't be better.

16:25.520 --> 16:26.389
Ah no.

16:27.389 --> 16:29.558
Ah no, I don't believe this.

16:30.491 --> 16:33.493
You know the
rules, Peter, one out, one in.

16:33.495 --> 16:35.362
So nice to be consulted.

16:35.364 --> 16:37.229
Look, if there's a problem,

16:37.231 --> 16:38.731
I can always piss
off to the pub.

16:38.733 --> 16:39.566
Vanessa...

16:39.568 --> 16:41.600
No, not at all.

16:41.602 --> 16:43.170
This is Sebastian.

16:43.172 --> 16:44.537
The one I told you about.

16:44.539 --> 16:46.639
Fine name, Sebastian.

16:46.641 --> 16:48.407
Thanks.

16:48.409 --> 16:50.243
Always hated it, myself.

16:50.245 --> 16:52.713
What do your friends
call you, then?

16:52.715 --> 16:53.980
Sebastian.

16:53.982 --> 16:55.983
Very telling.

16:55.985 --> 16:57.287
I am the Duke.

16:58.453 --> 16:59.619
You're a Duke?

16:59.621 --> 17:02.592
He's The Duke.

17:03.624 --> 17:05.425
Why not.

17:05.426 --> 17:06.326
I'm game.

17:06.328 --> 17:07.292
This is...

17:07.295 --> 17:08.463
No one to you.

17:12.534 --> 17:14.403
So you're
the gypsy boy, then.

17:16.738 --> 17:18.405
I say Romani.

17:18.406 --> 17:19.473
I'm Henry.

17:19.474 --> 17:21.272
I hail from the East myself.

17:21.275 --> 17:22.509
Oh, yeah.

17:22.511 --> 17:25.078
That's my barrier, is it?

17:25.079 --> 17:26.311
Alice.

17:26.314 --> 17:27.146
Hey.

17:27.148 --> 17:27.781
Angel.

17:27.782 --> 17:28.615
Hi.

17:28.617 --> 17:29.648
Ooh.

17:29.650 --> 17:30.550
Jesus.

17:30.552 --> 17:32.655
Get some gloves, you lot.

17:34.122 --> 17:36.491
Shall we begin?

17:57.545 --> 17:59.478
Now I suppose you're wondering...

18:04.820 --> 18:06.121
What the Fuck.

18:07.523 --> 18:09.755
The leg's been busted off.

18:09.757 --> 18:11.425
Here, have mine.

18:11.427 --> 18:13.392
Oh no, you're all right,
don't worry about it.

18:13.394 --> 18:15.161
Sebastian, just...

18:15.163 --> 18:16.429
No, seriously.

18:16.431 --> 18:17.263
No no, just take it.

18:17.265 --> 18:18.264
Sit, Sebastian.

18:18.266 --> 18:19.499
I'm just gonna
wait in the car.

18:19.501 --> 18:20.370
Please.

18:37.085 --> 18:39.718
We have a proposition for you.

18:39.720 --> 18:41.590
I thought you might.

18:43.624 --> 18:46.193
We are eight in number.

18:46.195 --> 18:47.726
We've always bene eight.

18:47.728 --> 18:50.597
Since before the
time of Ipsubal.

18:50.599 --> 18:52.264
The council decrees it.

18:52.266 --> 18:54.400
Yeah, my council's
a bit like that.

18:54.402 --> 18:56.570
They drive me mad, you know.

18:56.572 --> 18:58.707
Do you mind if I smoke?

18:59.707 --> 19:02.842
But this night, Sebastian...

19:02.844 --> 19:04.811
There's a space.

19:04.813 --> 19:07.414
If not a chair, right?

19:07.416 --> 19:08.284
Eh?

19:27.436 --> 19:28.871
Come in 18, over.

19:32.740 --> 19:34.843
I repeat, come in 18, over.

19:37.612 --> 19:39.649
18, will you please
respond, over.

19:42.417 --> 19:43.285
Dammit.

19:44.352 --> 19:46.619
Patience is a virtue, Padre.

19:46.621 --> 19:49.324
All good things come
to those who wait.

19:49.925 --> 19:51.625
Waited long enough.

19:51.627 --> 19:54.194
The Vatican's
waited 1000 years.

19:54.196 --> 19:58.330
I'm sure 10 more minutes
won't make any difference.

20:07.275 --> 20:09.411
Sebastian please,
this is important.

20:10.478 --> 20:13.946
Vanessa has spoken
very highly of you.

20:13.948 --> 20:16.218
She says you come
from good stock.

20:16.685 --> 20:18.818
You're joking, ain't ya?

20:18.820 --> 20:21.788
I'm a Romani from an orphanage.

20:21.790 --> 20:24.590
I sell back catalog, no band.

20:24.592 --> 20:26.461
That'll work for us.

20:28.429 --> 20:31.665
Look, I'd love
to and all that,

20:31.667 --> 20:35.769
but caught me on a bad
week and I'm tapped out.

20:35.771 --> 20:39.205
Normally, I am the
man to see, but.

20:39.207 --> 20:40.775
The boy's an idiot.

20:41.677 --> 20:43.342
No.

20:43.344 --> 20:45.811
Honest, I mean look, it
sounds brilliant and all that.

20:45.813 --> 20:47.813
Whatever it is.

20:47.815 --> 20:52.487
Save the whale or praise the
lord or whatever, but it's,

20:53.487 --> 20:54.589
I like to do my own thing.

20:56.324 --> 21:00.292
Plow my own furrow, so no
offense and all that, seriously.

21:00.294 --> 21:01.461
Thanks for asking.

21:05.734 --> 21:06.765
Shit.

21:06.767 --> 21:07.967
You didn't tell him?

21:07.969 --> 21:09.703
I thought we'd break
it to him gently.

21:09.705 --> 21:10.770
She's a monster.

21:10.772 --> 21:11.771
Calm down, Sebastian.

21:11.773 --> 21:13.540
No, she's a zombie.

21:13.542 --> 21:15.609
I'm off, bro, believe
that, I gotta go.

21:15.611 --> 21:17.711
Take a breath.

21:17.713 --> 21:18.844
No, no.

21:18.846 --> 21:19.714
I'm...

21:26.854 --> 21:30.724
We're not saving
the whales, Sebastian.

21:30.726 --> 21:33.693
And we are certainly
not peddling God.

21:33.695 --> 21:36.799
Tonight we must become eight.

21:39.034 --> 21:40.669
Oh fuck.

21:40.936 --> 21:44.407
Yeah, oh fuck indeed,
my young Romani kin.

21:45.306 --> 21:47.874
We have a vote before us.

21:47.876 --> 21:48.778
Yea or nay.

21:51.647 --> 21:52.948
Let's hear it now.

21:55.350 --> 21:56.916
Yea.

21:58.620 --> 21:59.487
Yea.

22:00.322 --> 22:01.521
Yea.

22:01.523 --> 22:02.390
Yea.

22:04.626 --> 22:05.891
Yea.

22:05.893 --> 22:07.329
And for Chen too.

22:08.929 --> 22:09.931
Nay.

22:16.604 --> 22:17.472
Nay?

22:18.073 --> 22:19.906
Thomas was my friend.

22:19.908 --> 22:22.074
I brought him in.

22:22.076 --> 22:23.842
You should've talked
to me about this.

22:23.844 --> 22:25.811
Nessa, what's he mean nay?

22:25.813 --> 22:26.713
Shh.

22:26.715 --> 22:29.081
I've spent months
on his candidature.

22:29.083 --> 22:31.917
He's 12 generations
pure, you can't do this.

22:31.919 --> 22:33.953
I can and I am.

22:33.955 --> 22:37.326
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

22:44.599 --> 22:46.866
We apologize, Sebastian.

22:46.868 --> 22:48.871
Hey, that's all right.

22:49.838 --> 22:51.870
It was nice meeting
you and all that.

22:51.872 --> 22:53.907
Oh, I'm sorry, Sebastian, it
wasn't meant to be like this,

22:53.909 --> 22:55.809
I thought they'd all accept you.

22:55.811 --> 22:56.944
I didn't count on the
fact that some people

22:56.946 --> 23:00.949
are just assholes, no matter
how long they live for.

23:01.917 --> 23:05.517
Wait, wait wait,
it's six to one.

23:05.519 --> 23:06.852
That's a landslide, surely.

23:06.854 --> 23:08.921
Has to be
unanimous, I'm afraid.

23:08.923 --> 23:11.558
Really did like
you, Sebastian.

23:11.560 --> 23:14.660
Well, I liked
you too, Vanessa.

23:14.662 --> 23:15.530
All of ya.

23:16.797 --> 23:17.866
What good lads.

23:19.434 --> 23:21.834
Even you, I mean,
you look all right.

23:21.836 --> 23:24.873
You take a day, get to
know me, we could be mates.

23:25.573 --> 23:26.941
You're not my type, son.

23:27.476 --> 23:29.844
Vanessa, he's
your responsibility.

23:53.534 --> 23:54.536
Sebastian.

23:55.704 --> 23:57.840
Just close your eyes

23:58.974 --> 24:01.110
and think happy thoughts.

24:03.477 --> 24:04.346
God.

24:05.112 --> 24:07.112
No no, wait wait, you can't.

24:07.114 --> 24:08.247
I've got kids.

24:08.249 --> 24:10.015
No you haven't Sebastian,
you haven't got anyone.

24:10.017 --> 24:10.885
No.

24:12.053 --> 24:13.389
I just said that.

24:13.688 --> 24:14.654
Yeah.

24:14.656 --> 24:15.725
Yeah, you did.

24:26.735 --> 24:27.966
Get back.

24:27.968 --> 24:30.837
Get back everyone,
in the name of God,

24:30.839 --> 24:33.572
the son and the holy
smoke, I command thee.

24:34.508 --> 24:36.009
You get back!

24:36.011 --> 24:37.644
Get back!

24:37.646 --> 24:38.578
You get back.

24:38.580 --> 24:39.812
I command thee.

24:39.814 --> 24:41.013
Did he just say "thee?"

24:41.015 --> 24:42.215
Yes.

24:42.217 --> 24:45.851
I don't think it
quite works like that.

24:45.853 --> 24:47.753
It
doesn't work like that?

24:47.755 --> 24:49.022
No.

24:49.024 --> 24:49.988
What
about this, then?

24:59.700 --> 25:00.568
Hey.

25:02.003 --> 25:03.906
Love hurts, I guess.

25:16.618 --> 25:18.154
Glad to see you're
still here, 18.

25:19.487 --> 25:20.456
What's happening in there?

25:20.855 --> 25:22.089
I dunno, sir.

25:22.091 --> 25:24.592
There's a lot of screaming,
shouting, yelling, all sorts.

25:24.793 --> 25:25.995
It's horrible.

25:27.062 --> 25:29.028
And that's your report, is it?

25:29.030 --> 25:30.163
Yeah.

25:30.165 --> 25:31.667
Who else is here, where's
backup?

25:33.834 --> 25:35.534
Don't worry about that.

25:35.536 --> 25:37.005
We've got it covered.

26:20.081 --> 26:21.015
Peekaboo.

26:22.182 --> 26:23.917
Oh, please.

26:23.919 --> 26:26.119
Come on, just leave me alone.

26:34.262 --> 26:35.096
Oh, me arse.

26:36.564 --> 26:37.799
Someone's
making a break for it.

26:40.701 --> 26:41.701
Get ready.

26:41.703 --> 26:42.738
Wait, sir.

26:44.139 --> 26:45.170
It's human.

26:45.172 --> 26:46.007
It's a hot body.

26:47.775 --> 26:48.710
It's not our target.

26:50.245 --> 26:52.811
He's a fighter, you
gotta give him that.

26:52.813 --> 26:53.782
So he is.

26:55.115 --> 26:56.849
Shame.

27:08.630 --> 27:09.661
Where did he come from?

27:09.663 --> 27:11.731
I don't know.

27:11.733 --> 27:16.234
Cold body, cold body, that's
him, that's our target.

27:16.236 --> 27:18.071
Get away from me, man.

27:18.073 --> 27:19.138
I mean it, mate.

27:19.140 --> 27:21.307
Look, I don't wanna fuck you up.

27:21.309 --> 27:22.641
Hyah.

27:22.643 --> 27:23.943
I'm warning you, bruv.

27:23.945 --> 27:25.047
I know kung fu.

27:29.684 --> 27:30.686
Is it him?

27:33.088 --> 27:36.254
Colonel Bingham, do you
have a visual on our target?

27:36.256 --> 27:39.058
Confirmed, Mr. Larousse,
the target is cold.

27:39.060 --> 27:40.129
We have a positive sighting.

27:41.161 --> 27:42.630
Oh, thank god.

27:46.634 --> 27:48.102
I'm giving you the order to go.

27:49.236 --> 27:51.169
Take the target down
with my authority

27:51.171 --> 27:52.140
and that of the Full Synod.

27:54.642 --> 27:56.408
Wait, cold body.

27:56.410 --> 27:58.176
Second target.

27:58.178 --> 28:00.213
God, seriously?

28:02.182 --> 28:03.116
Abort the grab.

28:03.118 --> 28:04.282
I repeat, abort the grab.

28:04.284 --> 28:05.217
Everyone stand down.

28:05.219 --> 28:06.785
What's going on?

28:06.787 --> 28:09.824
I said go, take him
down, do it now.

28:11.258 --> 28:13.595
I don't have time for this,
I've got places I need to be...

28:42.323 --> 28:43.225
What is it?

28:45.259 --> 28:46.327
There's something out here.

28:55.203 --> 28:57.969
Just out for his
dinner, Mr. Boniface.

28:57.971 --> 28:58.906
Same as us.

29:07.448 --> 29:08.950
He's all yours.

29:10.017 --> 29:12.353
Rouse him, it's only proper.

29:13.721 --> 29:14.722
Wakey wakey.

29:26.801 --> 29:28.337
Alright, lads?

29:37.845 --> 29:39.145
Piss off!

29:39.147 --> 29:40.213
Wait!

29:40.215 --> 29:41.280
Hey!

29:41.282 --> 29:42.384
Just a thought.

29:43.517 --> 29:45.784
Do we have any food in?

29:45.786 --> 29:48.120
It would be a shame
to waste a meal.

29:48.122 --> 29:48.990
What?

29:49.957 --> 29:52.992
This just gets better
and better, doesn't it?

29:58.332 --> 29:59.999
Colonel Bingham,
what's going on?

30:00.001 --> 30:02.001
I gave you the order to go,
so why haven't you gone?

30:02.003 --> 30:04.003
We have a second
target, Mr. Larousse,

30:04.005 --> 30:05.103
it changes everything.

30:05.105 --> 30:06.304
It changes nothing.

30:06.306 --> 30:08.743
We have the resources for two,
so I'm ordering you to go.

30:09.343 --> 30:11.878
Father, this is a
dangerous situation.

30:11.880 --> 30:12.880
Unique even.

30:13.814 --> 30:16.148
Now we need time to
reci the house properly.

30:16.150 --> 30:17.483
We don't have
the time, Colonel,

30:17.485 --> 30:18.951
if the targets are in the house

30:18.953 --> 30:20.856
you need to take
them down and now.

30:21.355 --> 30:22.388
Mr. Larousse.

30:22.390 --> 30:24.256
Now, Colonel!

30:24.258 --> 30:25.957
Stand by.

30:25.959 --> 30:26.794
We move on my order.

30:29.831 --> 30:30.498
Dammit.

30:32.867 --> 30:34.403
All those in favor.

30:38.372 --> 30:39.207
Against.

30:47.415 --> 30:49.415
Then we are decided.

30:49.417 --> 30:50.252
No.

30:51.319 --> 30:53.084
You can't eat me.

30:53.086 --> 30:55.423
I'm all fat and cholesterol.

30:59.928 --> 31:03.361
And I've
been so good all week.

31:05.365 --> 31:07.366
Everyone, get
down on the floor.

31:12.974 --> 31:14.340
Colonel.

31:14.342 --> 31:16.375
We have a problem.

31:16.377 --> 31:17.446
Oh, Corporal.

31:18.478 --> 31:20.312
You have no idea.

31:21.416 --> 31:23.482
Behind you.

31:23.484 --> 31:24.449
Get out, get out.

31:24.451 --> 31:25.917
Abort, abort.

31:28.488 --> 31:29.388
Help us.

31:29.390 --> 31:30.258
Help us!

31:31.426 --> 31:33.091
Captain,
Captain, we need assistance,

31:33.093 --> 31:34.025
we need assist...

31:39.601 --> 31:40.565
First squad come in.

31:40.567 --> 31:42.537
What's your status, over.

31:44.171 --> 31:46.872
First squad, I repeat, come
in, what's your status, over.

31:49.409 --> 31:51.109
Colonel Bingham?

31:51.111 --> 31:52.214
How many were in there?

31:54.882 --> 31:56.317
More than two, Mr. Larousse.

31:57.252 --> 31:58.387
More than two.

31:59.353 --> 32:00.956
First squad over and out.

32:20.941 --> 32:22.108
Help him up, help him up.

32:22.110 --> 32:23.042
Shh.

32:23.977 --> 32:25.477
Please, please don't go.

32:25.479 --> 32:26.378
Henry, what are we gonna do?

32:27.415 --> 32:28.417
- Henry.
- Shh.

32:30.051 --> 32:31.449
Shh, it's all right.

32:31.451 --> 32:32.451
No no no.

32:32.453 --> 32:33.555
Angel, Angel.

32:35.323 --> 32:36.525
It's too late.

32:37.592 --> 32:38.459
Shh.

32:56.143 --> 32:57.445
Who gets his territory, then?

33:03.618 --> 33:04.617
What?

33:04.619 --> 33:05.654
Too soon?

33:11.458 --> 33:13.259
Shouldn't we get out of here?

33:13.261 --> 33:15.394
I mean, if they're as
dangerous as you say,

33:15.396 --> 33:17.228
shouldn't we retreat?

33:17.230 --> 33:19.166
We've got the tiger
by the tail, 18.

33:20.200 --> 33:23.438
As long as we don't let go, we
won't end up like the others.

33:42.622 --> 33:44.456
I don't see anyone.

33:44.458 --> 33:46.625
No, there's more outside.

33:46.627 --> 33:47.560
How many?

33:48.528 --> 33:49.494
I dunno.

33:49.496 --> 33:50.763
If you want
to move into position

33:50.765 --> 33:52.430
you have my authority to go.

33:52.432 --> 33:54.065
Negative, we're standing fast.

33:54.067 --> 33:56.070
The situation has changed, over.

33:59.306 --> 34:01.273
Colonel Bingham, you
may have the experience,

34:01.275 --> 34:02.541
but I have the authority...

34:02.543 --> 34:05.044
I think they're having
the same conversation.

34:05.046 --> 34:06.512
Father Larousse.

34:06.514 --> 34:07.680
You have just given
out that order

34:07.682 --> 34:10.216
over a compromised
radio channel.

34:10.217 --> 34:12.583
Now before you go sacrificing
any more of my men,

34:12.585 --> 34:15.356
scramble to pre six, over.

34:15.755 --> 34:16.455
What's going on?

34:16.456 --> 34:17.722
I dunno, they just scrambled.

34:17.724 --> 34:19.091
Who are they?

34:19.092 --> 34:20.629
I dunno, Nessie.

34:22.030 --> 34:24.562
I've got a horrible feeling
they know exactly who we are.

34:24.563 --> 34:25.797
Guys.

34:25.800 --> 34:27.467
Someone's moving.

34:33.340 --> 34:37.708
Trying to leave
without saying goodbye?

34:37.710 --> 34:42.213
Trust me, Seba,
you don't want to go outside.

34:44.318 --> 34:45.751
There's not
gonna be any more assaults,

34:45.753 --> 34:47.686
Mr. Larousse, we're
sealing off the perimeter.

34:47.688 --> 34:49.554
That's not the plan, Colonel.

34:49.556 --> 34:52.456
The plan changes when
I lose a whole squad

34:52.458 --> 34:54.126
in under a minute.

34:54.128 --> 34:56.695
Now we've three squads
left, and I'm not wasting

34:56.697 --> 34:59.664
any more of my men for
nothing, do you understand?

34:59.666 --> 35:01.834
Colonel Bingham, this is
the opportunity of a lifetime,

35:01.836 --> 35:03.702
you can't just
let them get away.

35:03.704 --> 35:04.903
Then we won't.

35:04.905 --> 35:07.539
We're going to put a ring of
steel around this farmhouse

35:07.541 --> 35:08.744
till tomorrow.

35:10.378 --> 35:12.780
Nothing gets in or out of
that place alive tonight.

35:16.617 --> 35:17.850
Very good, Colonel, carry on.

35:20.755 --> 35:22.356
He says we can carry on.

35:31.532 --> 35:35.100
When fires
die and shoals combust,

35:35.102 --> 35:38.340
the blood recedes
to leave but dust.

35:39.340 --> 35:40.638
What do we do with him?

35:40.640 --> 35:42.608
Got a broom or something, or?

35:42.610 --> 35:44.709
I've seen a dustpan
and brush somewhere.

35:44.711 --> 35:47.680
Dear god, who says
there's no dignity in death?

35:47.682 --> 35:48.613
His problems are over.

35:48.615 --> 35:50.282
Ours are just beginning.

35:50.284 --> 35:52.318
Let's just Skype
next time, yeah?

35:52.320 --> 35:53.519
What's Skype?

35:53.521 --> 35:55.620
That internet
phone thingy, Alice.

35:55.622 --> 35:57.655
I can work the video now.

35:57.657 --> 35:59.258
You still using tapes?

35:59.260 --> 36:00.291
Yes, why?

36:00.293 --> 36:01.459
Jesus.

36:01.461 --> 36:03.729
It's like being
around me nan's house.

36:03.731 --> 36:06.332
Oh yeah, that reminds me.

36:06.334 --> 36:07.765
Does somebody want
to kill him now?

36:07.767 --> 36:08.700
I'll do it.

36:08.702 --> 36:11.269
No, we might still need him.

36:11.271 --> 36:12.604
Are you sure?

36:12.606 --> 36:13.439
She's sure.

36:13.441 --> 36:14.273
You're sure?

36:14.275 --> 36:15.508
She's sure, she's sure.

36:15.510 --> 36:16.608
Yeah, until we know
what we're dealing with,

36:16.610 --> 36:18.244
we can just put him downstairs
with the rest, okay?

36:18.246 --> 36:19.477
I'll take him.

36:19.479 --> 36:20.412
No, I brought
him here tonight.

36:20.414 --> 36:21.446
Well split him then.

36:21.448 --> 36:22.381
I'll take him.

36:22.383 --> 36:23.515
I'll take him.

36:23.517 --> 36:25.651
Neither of you are taking him.

36:25.653 --> 36:26.584
I'm doing it.

36:26.586 --> 36:28.687
No sides, no arguments.

36:28.689 --> 36:32.791
Not if we want to get
out of here tonight.

36:32.793 --> 36:34.160
Hang on a minute.

36:34.162 --> 36:35.227
What others?

36:35.229 --> 36:36.262
Who are you talking about?

36:36.264 --> 36:38.467
You're all right, go on.

36:41.836 --> 36:43.736
Anyone use one
of these before?

36:48.242 --> 36:49.678
I've got one at home.

36:54.414 --> 36:55.784
The Thatchers.

36:56.684 --> 36:57.749
It's their farm.

36:57.751 --> 36:58.619
Ah.

37:00.621 --> 37:01.687
You all right?

37:01.689 --> 37:03.191
How's it going?

37:06.193 --> 37:08.660
Vanessa was right about you.

37:08.662 --> 37:11.196
You are something else.

37:11.198 --> 37:12.400
Coming from.

37:31.418 --> 37:32.286
Shh.

37:36.691 --> 37:37.626
Sir?

37:39.392 --> 37:39.827
Sir.

37:40.760 --> 37:41.626
What is it?

37:41.628 --> 37:42.764
Something odd.

37:54.809 --> 37:56.408
For god's sake.

37:56.410 --> 37:58.477
Stop that before the others see.

37:58.479 --> 37:59.414
Boy's dead.

38:00.414 --> 38:02.814
I don't care, I'm starving.

38:02.816 --> 38:05.017
That's disgusting.

38:05.019 --> 38:07.318
He's still warm.

38:07.320 --> 38:08.189
Want some?

38:15.863 --> 38:16.894
What was that for?!

38:16.896 --> 38:18.363
Someone else objecting to your

38:18.365 --> 38:21.767
questionable culinary
habits, it would seem.

38:21.769 --> 38:23.035
Here, keep it.

38:25.639 --> 38:28.842
Everyone's a food
critic these days.

38:40.021 --> 38:40.889
Stop!

39:02.476 --> 39:05.747
Eat this, you sons of bitches.

39:10.450 --> 39:12.320
Everybody shoot her!

39:26.400 --> 39:27.599
Alice!

39:27.601 --> 39:28.570
I'm busy!

39:42.450 --> 39:43.849
Hey.

39:43.851 --> 39:45.550
Glad you came?

39:45.552 --> 39:46.952
Oh yeah.

39:46.954 --> 39:49.854
Vampires with machine guns.

39:49.856 --> 39:50.988
What's not to love?

39:55.930 --> 39:57.629
Perfect.

40:04.572 --> 40:06.437
They got me.

40:06.439 --> 40:07.840
Evidently.

40:07.842 --> 40:08.941
You know, there
are other guns.

40:08.943 --> 40:10.908
Well you're all making
enough noise on your own,

40:10.910 --> 40:11.412
sweetheart.

40:12.012 --> 40:13.912
You're such a prick.

40:18.052 --> 40:19.751
Colonel Bingham,
come in, I repeat,

40:19.753 --> 40:20.919
what's happening, over.

40:20.921 --> 40:22.187
Talk to me.

40:22.189 --> 40:24.359
They're trying out the weapons
you've gifted them Father, over.

40:24.858 --> 40:26.858
Well stop firing, you're
just wasting ammunition,

40:26.860 --> 40:28.529
you can't kill them
that way anyway.

40:29.630 --> 40:30.695
You may be right.

40:30.697 --> 40:32.664
They don't like it either.

40:37.405 --> 40:38.106
You okay?

40:39.439 --> 40:40.972
I'll live.

40:40.974 --> 40:41.942
True enough.

40:51.184 --> 40:52.184
Hold on.

40:55.021 --> 40:56.555
Alice.

40:56.557 --> 40:58.055
Alice.

41:03.564 --> 41:04.432
Shh.

41:12.006 --> 41:13.539
They've stopped shooting.

41:13.541 --> 41:15.774
No shit, Sherlock.

41:15.776 --> 41:18.676
I don't think my suit could've
taken much more of this.

41:18.678 --> 41:22.550
You are no fun in a
fight, do you know that?

41:29.722 --> 41:30.789
Pity.

41:30.791 --> 41:32.994
One more minute, they
would've been out of ammo.

41:34.662 --> 41:36.765
Colonel, I think you
should look at this.

41:43.169 --> 41:44.706
Might be a longer
night than we thought.

41:46.974 --> 41:47.809
Christ.

41:52.546 --> 41:54.812
Oh shit, I been shot.

41:54.814 --> 41:57.950
I been shot, I been shot,
quick, someone, please,

41:57.952 --> 42:00.084
quick, please,
call an ambulance...

42:00.086 --> 42:02.521
No, calm down,
calm down, Seba.

42:02.523 --> 42:04.155
No you haven't,
that's just my blood.

42:04.157 --> 42:05.057
You idiot.

42:05.059 --> 42:07.225
Oh, it's your blood.

42:07.227 --> 42:08.162
Your blood.

42:12.932 --> 42:14.066
Get it off me, man.

42:14.068 --> 42:15.800
Get it off me, please get
it off me, get it off me...

42:15.802 --> 42:16.869
Wait, wait, wait.

42:16.871 --> 42:18.037
- Get it off me, get it off me.
- What's wrong now?

42:18.039 --> 42:21.106
Mate, if it's your blood,
who knows what you've got?

42:25.945 --> 42:27.211
I'll tell you what,
if I've got anything

42:27.213 --> 42:28.981
it'll be foot in mouth disease.

42:29.883 --> 42:30.751
What?

42:33.086 --> 42:36.821
I'm not a human
feeder, Sebastian.

42:36.823 --> 42:38.856
I only take from animals.

42:38.858 --> 42:40.691
But I thought you was...

42:40.693 --> 42:43.695
Yeah, as most people do.

42:43.697 --> 42:45.997
We don't all feed on humans.

42:45.999 --> 42:47.034
I choose not to.

42:48.535 --> 42:49.637
Why's that?

42:52.740 --> 42:55.008
Because I used to be one.

43:02.816 --> 43:04.816
Henry.

43:04.818 --> 43:05.753
Two's up.

43:07.253 --> 43:08.121
Safe.

43:19.934 --> 43:21.767
I love you.

43:21.769 --> 43:23.171
Oh, fuck off.

43:33.881 --> 43:34.616
Look.

43:40.153 --> 43:40.954
How many?

43:41.287 --> 43:42.923
Enough.

43:44.157 --> 43:45.125
Enough for what?

43:46.059 --> 43:48.161
Enough to stop us from
leaving before dawn.

43:49.262 --> 43:50.297
What then?

43:52.231 --> 43:57.838
Why then, dear boy, we
won't be leaving at all.

44:15.122 --> 44:16.854
Feeling brave, Mr. Larousse?

44:16.856 --> 44:18.122
I can't see anything
from back there,

44:18.124 --> 44:19.256
I need to know what's happening.

44:19.258 --> 44:21.595
Not much, at the moment.

44:22.229 --> 44:23.829
Can we hold them there?

44:23.831 --> 44:25.097
Until sunrise?

44:25.099 --> 44:29.070
Well if we don't, I'll
be sure to let you know.

44:33.974 --> 44:37.274
They're just in
there, aren't they?

44:37.276 --> 44:39.079
They're really there.

44:43.916 --> 44:47.986
What if we could take
just one of them out alive?

44:47.988 --> 44:49.787
What are you talking about?

44:49.789 --> 44:51.155
Just to get a sample.

44:51.157 --> 44:52.758
For the sake of science.

44:52.760 --> 44:55.193
These things are an
abomination, Colonel.

44:55.195 --> 44:57.662
They need to be wiped from
the face of this Earth.

44:57.664 --> 44:59.296
Righteous speech,
Mr. Larousse,

44:59.298 --> 45:01.432
but I think we're
missing an opportunity.

45:01.434 --> 45:04.702
We have them trapped, Colonel,
this is our opportunity.

45:04.704 --> 45:07.674
We might never be this close
to this many of them again.

45:08.307 --> 45:09.142
You're right.

45:10.209 --> 45:11.211
I know I am.

45:13.213 --> 45:16.217
My authority comes
right from the top.

45:22.122 --> 45:25.226
What's, no no no, this
doesn't happen, what is this?

45:26.894 --> 45:28.029
My authority.

45:28.996 --> 45:31.099
I'll be taking
charge from now on.

45:52.720 --> 45:53.885
But
you can stay here.

45:53.887 --> 45:54.986
Look, see if I care.

45:54.988 --> 45:56.722
I'm not saying
that, I'm just saying that

45:56.724 --> 45:58.122
we shouldn't go out
there without a plan.

45:58.124 --> 45:59.390
And the plan is
I'm just gonna go for it.

45:59.392 --> 46:01.325
I'm gonna go towards the trees
and I'm just gonna go for it.

46:01.327 --> 46:03.028
That's not a plan.
Running is what you do

46:03.030 --> 46:04.062
when you don't have a plan.

46:04.064 --> 46:05.229
The place is surrounded,
how far do you think

46:05.231 --> 46:06.465
we're gonna get anyway?

46:06.467 --> 46:09.102
Far enough for my issues not
to get mixed up with yours.

46:09.869 --> 46:10.904
I'm ready.

46:12.271 --> 46:13.238
For what?

46:13.240 --> 46:14.104
We haven't even decided
what we're doing yet.

46:14.106 --> 46:17.209
Guys, the game
might be up for us.

46:17.211 --> 46:20.378
But we can still make a few
widows before this night's out.

46:20.380 --> 46:23.148
Of course, we don't
all have to get away.

46:23.150 --> 46:24.316
What's that?

46:24.318 --> 46:25.883
What are you talking
about, old woman?

46:25.885 --> 46:27.519
No, no, she's right.

46:27.521 --> 46:29.387
What do mean by that, what?

46:29.389 --> 46:31.256
As long as they've got
us where they can see us,

46:31.258 --> 46:32.990
we're hog-tied.

46:32.992 --> 46:36.928
But if one of us can get
away, get to the shadows.

46:36.930 --> 46:38.433
The night is ours.

46:39.465 --> 46:40.333
Okay.

46:41.468 --> 46:43.434
Okay, good, so now
we have a plan.

46:43.436 --> 46:45.003
I'm ready.

46:45.005 --> 46:46.070
Chen's ready.

46:46.072 --> 46:48.305
So we break as one, all
in the same direction,

46:48.307 --> 46:49.975
at the same time.

46:49.977 --> 46:51.876
And the first one in
the clear doubles back

46:51.878 --> 46:55.315
and butchers every last
single one of them.

47:28.148 --> 47:29.414
I did it.

47:29.416 --> 47:30.448
Did you see that?

47:30.450 --> 47:31.319
I did it!

47:33.320 --> 47:35.954
Don't worry, I'll
come back with help.

47:44.164 --> 47:45.932
Fine, but you owe me.

47:48.068 --> 47:50.202
You can have a Victoria
Cross and a little notch

47:50.204 --> 47:53.307
if you'd like, just
get us out of here.

47:54.508 --> 47:56.073
Please hold
the line.

47:56.075 --> 47:59.176
Infinity help UT,
please hold the line,

47:59.178 --> 48:01.879
you are currently
ninth in the queue.

48:01.881 --> 48:03.117
Son of a bitch.

48:05.052 --> 48:06.318
Who was that?

48:06.320 --> 48:08.919
Someone who pays more
than you, Mr. Larousse.

48:08.921 --> 48:10.988
30 pieces of silver, is it?

48:10.990 --> 48:14.392
More or less,
allowing for inflation.

48:14.394 --> 48:16.930
Hold up, I got ya, I got ya.

48:22.468 --> 48:25.169
Well use your
bleeding arms, then.

48:25.171 --> 48:28.275
Oh shit, sir,
we got movement.

48:30.177 --> 48:31.475
What is it?

48:31.477 --> 48:35.347
Someone at the
farmhouse just there.

48:35.349 --> 48:37.883
What the hell is that?

48:39.086 --> 48:42.287
Come on, Frodo, put
your back into it.

48:43.523 --> 48:45.289
Sniper one,
leave that target pinned down

48:45.291 --> 48:49.362
until we find out if it's
one of them or us, over.

49:00.307 --> 49:02.374
Jesus Christ!

49:02.376 --> 49:03.575
Warm body,
sir, warm body.

49:03.577 --> 49:04.943
It's human.

49:06.046 --> 49:07.515
Hold your fire.

49:08.481 --> 49:10.115
Go on then, get out of here.

49:10.117 --> 49:11.084
Go, go, go!

49:12.686 --> 49:17.490
Good work, sniper
one, you have backup, over.

49:26.432 --> 49:28.335
What is she doing?

49:29.702 --> 49:32.671
Evading our fire, it seems.

49:32.673 --> 49:35.240
Well let's give her a
little bit of encouragement.

49:35.242 --> 49:36.341
Go on then.

49:39.680 --> 49:40.548
Your go.

49:43.617 --> 49:44.950
To you.

49:45.584 --> 49:47.117
To you.

49:48.488 --> 49:53.524
Jesus, some people don't know
nothing.

49:53.526 --> 49:56.593
I don't believe
it, she made it.

49:56.595 --> 49:58.062
You all right, mate?

49:58.064 --> 49:59.463
Don't look at me like that.

49:59.465 --> 50:02.733
She was the one that
didn't want to wait for ya.

50:02.735 --> 50:03.904
This way.

50:12.479 --> 50:14.312
Oh, thank you.

50:14.314 --> 50:15.680
Thank you.

50:15.682 --> 50:19.253
You have no idea what
I've been through.

50:21.421 --> 50:24.254
Who are you?

50:24.256 --> 50:26.224
I'm Mrs. Thatcher.

50:26.226 --> 50:27.628
I live on the farm.

50:28.528 --> 50:31.098
They came tonight, they did.

50:33.066 --> 50:34.466
How many are there?

50:34.468 --> 50:36.037
Six, seven maybe?

50:37.537 --> 50:40.140
Plus some grotty little scumbag.

50:41.041 --> 50:43.108
They're all in it together.

50:43.110 --> 50:45.542
And my husband as
well, knowing him.

50:50.017 --> 50:50.682
I can't get it off.

50:51.318 --> 50:52.584
He's done it up too tight.

50:52.586 --> 50:53.751
Yeah... get off...
knife.

50:53.753 --> 50:56.421
What?

50:56.423 --> 50:58.655
Pull my gag off
and...

50:58.657 --> 51:00.124
Hold up.

51:00.126 --> 51:01.325
Sorry mate.

51:01.327 --> 51:02.526
Ah, okay.

51:02.528 --> 51:05.229
Just cut it off, there's
a knife over there.

51:05.231 --> 51:06.298
Where?

51:06.300 --> 51:08.298
Over there on the
workbench, there's a knife.

51:08.300 --> 51:09.566
Just cut it off.

51:09.568 --> 51:10.401
What, there?

51:10.403 --> 51:11.535
What, this one?

51:11.537 --> 51:12.704
I can't see it.

51:12.706 --> 51:14.104
Over there
on the workbench, blindo,

51:14.106 --> 51:15.539
right in front of ya.

51:15.541 --> 51:17.341
Well
I can't see one.

51:17.343 --> 51:19.679
Keep looking.

51:21.213 --> 51:22.414
In there?

51:22.416 --> 51:23.747
No, no no, don't
look in there!

51:38.597 --> 51:39.763
Don't look at me, sport.

51:39.765 --> 51:41.499
That was here when we moved in.

51:43.336 --> 51:44.169
You're
sure that's everything?

51:44.171 --> 51:46.303
Yeah.

51:46.305 --> 51:46.807
Yeah, I told you.

51:54.247 --> 51:55.082
Right.

51:55.682 --> 51:56.450
I'll be off.

52:00.352 --> 52:03.287
I got a heart
condition, you know.

52:03.289 --> 52:04.789
I'm not a well woman.

52:04.791 --> 52:06.356
Certainly.

52:06.358 --> 52:07.460
Come with me?

52:11.231 --> 52:14.566
Oh, thanks babes, but I
don't wanna bother you no more.

52:14.568 --> 52:17.371
I'll be fine on
my own from here.

52:18.771 --> 52:19.739
I insist.

52:23.276 --> 52:24.145
Okay.

52:25.579 --> 52:27.611
Might just nip behind that tree.

52:27.613 --> 52:28.682
Here I go.

52:30.617 --> 52:32.787
Been tied up half the night.

52:33.753 --> 52:36.157
Absolutely bursting, I am.

52:37.724 --> 52:40.561
Got a bladder like
a filled balloon.

52:46.633 --> 52:47.499
Let me out!

52:47.501 --> 52:49.133
What, end up
pickled like that lot?

52:49.135 --> 52:50.334
No thanks.

52:50.336 --> 52:53.637
You got all that coming
to you, sunshine.

52:53.639 --> 52:54.905
Come here!

53:10.222 --> 53:12.923
What'd you do that for?

53:12.925 --> 53:14.691
She could've been
in league with them.

53:14.693 --> 53:15.792
Could've?

53:15.794 --> 53:17.794
What sort of
justification is that?

53:17.796 --> 53:19.631
An uncertain one.

53:19.633 --> 53:21.798
Now there's certainty.

53:21.800 --> 53:23.600
You're mad.

53:23.602 --> 53:24.801
This is madness.

53:24.803 --> 53:26.206
This is war, 18.

53:27.374 --> 53:30.377
You'd better decide whose
side you're on, before dawn.

53:35.814 --> 53:37.684
Sun's up in four hours, 18.

53:37.950 --> 53:38.885
Tick-tock.

53:42.655 --> 53:45.291
I can't believe she's dead.

53:52.631 --> 53:54.300
It's nearly 20 years
we been together.

53:55.735 --> 53:56.637
She didn't deserve that.

53:57.771 --> 53:58.706
I'm sorry.

54:02.909 --> 54:05.746
Look, as one human
being to another,

54:08.247 --> 54:09.546
you gotta let me
out, right, yeah?

54:09.548 --> 54:10.416
Let me go.

54:13.653 --> 54:15.189
I can't do that.

54:17.756 --> 54:20.557
Look, it really
wasn't my fault.

54:20.559 --> 54:21.992
I mean, when you
trace it all back,

54:21.994 --> 54:24.394
it was Mrs. Thatcher's fault.

54:24.396 --> 54:27.731
I mean, I loved her, but
she was fuckin' nuts.

55:00.599 --> 55:02.899
You had
me fooled once.

55:02.901 --> 55:05.238
The lady's not concerned.

55:06.740 --> 55:10.675
So, so what, look, look,
you're gonna untie me, yeah?

55:10.677 --> 55:11.876
Nah.

55:15.782 --> 55:17.048
Fucking hell.

55:23.689 --> 55:25.622
second squad, hold
your positions.

55:25.624 --> 55:28.325
Do not let a single
one out of your sights.

55:28.327 --> 55:31.028
Third squad, you've
got two to your left.

55:34.534 --> 55:35.666
Chen.

55:35.668 --> 55:36.633
Where's the bloody cars?

56:29.988 --> 56:31.789
Stay where you are!

56:34.093 --> 56:35.593
Will you let me,
I know you're there,

56:35.595 --> 56:37.794
for god's sake, do something!

56:37.796 --> 56:40.765
Well that's not
gonna help, is it?

56:42.635 --> 56:45.738
Okay, it was pretty helpful,
thank you very much.

56:53.947 --> 56:55.416
So quiet.

56:55.881 --> 56:56.684
Better move.

56:57.383 --> 56:57.918
Better keep moving.

57:08.026 --> 57:08.892
Chen.

57:08.894 --> 57:09.827
- Chen?
- Go.

57:09.829 --> 57:10.660
Chen, no.

57:10.662 --> 57:12.430
No no no, listen
to me, Vanessa.

57:12.432 --> 57:13.930
Get out of here.

57:13.932 --> 57:15.001
Chen.

57:44.497 --> 57:45.799
Who's in there?

58:45.657 --> 58:46.957
Shoot him!

58:46.959 --> 58:47.791
Shoot him!

58:47.793 --> 58:48.593
I'm out!

58:48.595 --> 58:49.827
Here, have one more.

59:01.508 --> 59:02.138
Enemy down.

59:02.140 --> 59:03.073
We've got him, sir.

59:20.827 --> 59:22.095
Keep searching.

59:31.871 --> 59:34.905
We have a visual of
a lone female, over.

59:34.907 --> 59:38.108
We need to
get back to the house.

59:38.110 --> 59:39.843
There's too many of them.

59:39.845 --> 59:41.048
We're gonna die out here.

59:54.193 --> 59:55.062
Shh.

01:00:00.198 --> 01:00:01.131
Over here.

01:00:01.133 --> 01:00:02.066
We found her, sir.

01:00:02.068 --> 01:00:03.903
We found her, over.

01:00:06.039 --> 01:00:07.704
We have a visual...

01:00:08.775 --> 01:00:09.240
In position, sir.

01:00:09.242 --> 01:00:09.974
Oh.

01:00:09.976 --> 01:00:11.274
Awaiting orders.

01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:30.026
Oi.

01:00:30.028 --> 01:00:31.995
All right, lads.

01:00:31.997 --> 01:00:33.229
Who's winning?

01:00:33.231 --> 01:00:37.300
Yeah, who's winning?

01:00:37.302 --> 01:00:38.571
Hi, Sebastian

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:43.173
Anyone else
in here besides you two?

01:00:43.175 --> 01:00:46.209
Well, there's a few hot
pickles in jars over there.

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:49.146
Yeah.

01:00:49.148 --> 01:00:52.149
We pick our hosts
quite carefully.

01:00:52.151 --> 01:00:53.149
Yeah?

01:00:53.151 --> 01:00:55.688
Worked out great, hasn't it?

01:01:09.369 --> 01:01:12.269
It's not over yet.

01:01:12.271 --> 01:01:13.740
If anyone can do it, she can.

01:01:44.803 --> 01:01:46.671
You all right, love?

01:01:46.673 --> 01:01:47.841
Hold your position, soldier.

01:01:51.744 --> 01:01:54.280
I, I, I don't hear very well.

01:01:55.347 --> 01:01:58.017
Soldier, I said
hold your position!

01:01:58.851 --> 01:02:01.718
They did terrible
things to me.

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:04.320
Really, really terrible things.

01:02:04.322 --> 01:02:05.291
Soldier!

01:02:05.791 --> 01:02:08.091
You're safe now.

01:02:08.093 --> 01:02:08.928
Oh my.

01:02:12.164 --> 01:02:13.265
Let's get you out of here.

01:02:19.405 --> 01:02:20.905
Fire!

01:02:22.809 --> 01:02:23.974
Shit.

01:02:23.976 --> 01:02:26.242
We've barely two
squads left, Colonel.

01:02:26.244 --> 01:02:28.080
It's not enough to
hold this place.

01:02:29.014 --> 01:02:31.282
They're down as
well, Mr. Larousse.

01:02:31.284 --> 01:02:33.383
There are only three of
them left, and they're hurt.

01:02:33.385 --> 01:02:35.255
They won't try that again.

01:02:36.021 --> 01:02:37.157
Actually sir, there's four.

01:02:40.727 --> 01:02:42.325
Hello.

01:02:42.327 --> 01:02:45.095
How's your evening panning out?

01:02:45.097 --> 01:02:46.497
What do we do with her, sir?

01:02:46.499 --> 01:02:49.033
Please, we have
to kill her now.

01:02:49.035 --> 01:02:50.066
She's too dangerous to hold.

01:02:50.869 --> 01:02:51.334
Little old me?

01:02:51.336 --> 01:02:52.171
Please.

01:02:56.409 --> 01:02:57.209
Sir?

01:02:59.278 --> 01:03:00.781
Break out the frame.

01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:23.466
Take it easy.

01:03:23.468 --> 01:03:25.436
Liable to hurt
yourself with that.

01:03:25.438 --> 01:03:27.403
Are we the
only ones who made it?

01:03:27.405 --> 01:03:28.240
Not quite.

01:03:29.941 --> 01:03:30.807
Perfect.

01:03:30.809 --> 01:03:32.309
My night's complete.

01:03:32.311 --> 01:03:34.247
You and me both, Chuckles.

01:03:36.048 --> 01:03:38.385
What the bloody hell's
happened to my living room?

01:03:40.218 --> 01:03:41.854
What we gonna do?

01:03:45.925 --> 01:03:46.990
We need a plan.

01:03:46.992 --> 01:03:49.829
Look, why don't you
just try talking to them.

01:03:52.465 --> 01:03:54.198
Talking to them?

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:57.535
Yeah, you know, strike
up a little pow-wow.

01:03:57.537 --> 01:03:59.436
What you got to lose?

01:03:59.438 --> 01:04:01.571
They want to exterminate us.

01:04:01.573 --> 01:04:03.941
Yeah, well you won't be
getting your deposit back,

01:04:03.943 --> 01:04:05.108
that's for sure.

01:04:05.110 --> 01:04:06.242
Yeah, well, they're
probably saying

01:04:06.244 --> 01:04:08.178
the same thing out there.

01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:10.316
Why don't you just go see
what their best offer is?

01:04:13.285 --> 01:04:14.218
Okay.

01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:16.287
And, ,

01:04:16.289 --> 01:04:18.892
how would we do that?

01:04:19.191 --> 01:04:20.825
Well you're not seriously
asking him for advice...

01:04:20.827 --> 01:04:22.325
You have any better
ideas right now?

01:04:22.327 --> 01:04:26.967
Look mate, I've been around,
you know, I know the score.

01:04:28.066 --> 01:04:30.401
I'm over 2000 years old, boy.

01:04:30.403 --> 01:04:32.303
I fourth at the
Battle of Erbella.

01:04:32.305 --> 01:04:34.470
I fought with
Alexander through Asia.

01:04:34.472 --> 01:04:38.242
We conquered the known
world and we ruled as gods.

01:04:38.244 --> 01:04:41.445
Oh, that's all well and
good and all that, but

01:04:41.447 --> 01:04:43.215
what you done lately?

01:04:52.457 --> 01:04:53.557
Oh, jeez.

01:04:58.331 --> 01:05:01.367
Oh, just, come
on, just let me go,

01:05:02.468 --> 01:05:03.533
come on, let me
down, this is done.

01:05:04.369 --> 01:05:05.401
What's your name?

01:05:06.238 --> 01:05:07.106
Death.

01:05:07.939 --> 01:05:09.909
And I'm coming for you.

01:05:13.345 --> 01:05:15.512
You should know better
than to hit a lady.

01:05:15.514 --> 01:05:19.015
You're no lady, my dear.

01:05:19.017 --> 01:05:21.084
You so much as lay
a finger on her,

01:05:21.086 --> 01:05:24.456
touch her, or harm her
in any way, you will die.

01:05:26.258 --> 01:05:27.658
You don't know
what you're doing.

01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:30.093
Maybe not, but
there is a cosmetic company

01:05:30.095 --> 01:05:32.329
that will be here in
the morning that do.

01:05:32.331 --> 01:05:33.296
And then what?

01:05:33.298 --> 01:05:37.036
And then, me and my
