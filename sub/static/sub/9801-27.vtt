No, stop, wait!

01:29.680 --> 01:31.370
-Relax, Marlene.

01:31.370 --> 01:34.420
We've had that nest staked out
for a Humpty Dumpty scenario

01:34.420 --> 01:36.410
since the first day of spring.

01:40.640 --> 01:42.020
Loud and clear.

01:48.290 --> 01:49.790
-So, let me get this straight.

01:49.790 --> 01:51.440
You guys have been
watching that one

01:51.440 --> 01:53.290

beginning of spring?

01:53.290 --> 01:56.280
-Don't be ridiculous, Marlene.

01:56.280 --> 01:59.280
We've been watching all of them.

01:59.280 --> 02:01.980

have a little saying--

02:01.980 --> 02:06.930
there's only one way to do the

it back in time for tea?

it starts drawing attention.

-I'm afraid it's too
late for that, Skipper.

02:44.650 --> 02:48.780
ALICE: Yeah, looks like a
rupture of the central main.

02:48.780 --> 02:50.490
Yeah, the penguin exhibit.

02:50.490 --> 02:51.870
We'll need to tear
up the whole thing

02:51.870 --> 02:53.220
to get at the damaged pipe.

02:53.220 --> 02:55.730
-Ooh, what about your
secret underground HQ thing?

02:55.730 --> 02:57.440
If they dig up the
habitat, won't they find--

02:57.440 --> 03:00.560
-Not on my watch, sister.

03:00.560 --> 03:03.030
-So, we're definitely going to
have to call in a specialist

I feel better now.

That's all you had to say.

-Gus?

03:13.420 --> 03:15.780
-Who's this Gus?

03:22.930 --> 03:25.710
KOWALSKI: His name is Gustav
"Gus" Babuskha, age 49,

03:25.710 --> 03:29.220
born in Saint Petersburg--
Russia, not Florida.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.720
ALICE: So what do you think?

03:34.720 --> 03:36.610
GUS: Me and the boys
will have to tunnel

03:36.610 --> 03:39.700
about four metres straight down.

03:39.700 --> 03:40.400
-Great.

03:40.400 --> 03:41.850
How soon can your crew get here?

-No, you misunderstand.

The boys are already here.

Gus won the silver medal

03:54.120 --> 03:58.190

1979 Pan Asian Games.

lunch every day, liverwurst.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.760
-Liverwurst.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.290
That's all I needed to know.

04:07.290 --> 04:08.020
MARLENE: Liverwurst?

04:08.020 --> 04:10.400
That's how you're going to
stop Gus from doing this job?

04:10.400 --> 04:11.250
-Of course not.

04:11.250 --> 04:13.310
We're going to do it for him.

Oh, Marlene, you
don't mind if we

-No, hey, really-- no,

itsy bitsy elves came in night

04:55.340 --> 04:58.190
and [RASPBERRY] did
entire job for us.

04:58.190 --> 04:59.290
-Well wait-- but
isn't that going

04:59.290 --> 05:00.610
to seem a little suspicious?

05:00.610 --> 05:02.500
I mean, won't that
Gus guy say something?

05:02.500 --> 05:03.240
-I doubt it.

Not when he sees the little
gift we left for him.

05:06.220 --> 05:08.500
-And what is this?

05:08.500 --> 05:10.120
A liverwurst sandwich?

05:10.120 --> 05:12.510
-It's simple human
psychology, Marlene.

05:12.510 --> 05:14.910
-Humans are, by
nature, lazy bums.

05:14.910 --> 05:18.560
-They love it when itsy
bitsy elves do their work.

05:18.560 --> 05:20.120
-Amazing work, Gus.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.520
I suppose I'm going
to have to give you

05:21.520 --> 05:24.580
a little bonus for
finishing the job so fast.

05:26.950 --> 05:29.930
-I cannot accept this
money, or this sandwich.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.800
-But what's the problem?

05:31.800 --> 05:33.360
-Yeah, what's the problem?

05:33.360 --> 05:35.220
-Back in Murmansk
we have saying,

05:35.220 --> 05:38.470
there is only one way to
do job-- the right way.

05:38.470 --> 05:40.530
Me and my boys will
come back tomorrow

05:40.530 --> 05:43.360
and do the whole thing over.

05:43.360 --> 05:45.860
On second thought, I
will accept sandwich.

05:45.860 --> 05:49.500
My boys need their strength.

05:49.500 --> 05:52.070
KOWALSKI: This shows Gus's
digging progress thus far.

05:52.070 --> 05:54.110
f he continues at his
current trajectory,

05:54.110 --> 05:55.350
he'll miss hitting
the underground

-OK, so that's good, right?

05:59.680 --> 06:00.960
-Well, not really, no.

06:00.960 --> 06:04.140
It means that he's heading right
down towards this yellow zone,

06:04.140 --> 06:05.120
over here.

06:05.120 --> 06:06.870
-But-- but that means
he'll breach our top-secret

06:30.750 --> 06:32.340
-Nobody knows for certain.

06:32.340 --> 06:34.810
It's all abstract
theoretical physics.

06:34.810 --> 06:39.010
I could outline the basic
best and worst case scenarios.

06:40.630 --> 06:43.120
-OK, rupturing the lining
of the reactor chamber

06:43.120 --> 06:47.000
could theoretically trigger a
subatomic explosion so intense

06:47.000 --> 06:50.410
that it would rip open the
very fabric of time and space.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.490
-Wow, that's-- ooh.

06:51.490 --> 06:53.860
OK, and what's the
best case scenario?
