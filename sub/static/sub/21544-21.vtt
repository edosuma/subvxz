WEBVTT

00:05.311 --> 00:06.506
Huh?

00:07.346 --> 00:08.511
Remember, lads,

00:08.588 --> 00:11.016
no sudden movements,
no eye contact.

00:11.093 --> 00:12.269
If you're cornered,

00:12.346 --> 00:15.382
the heartless heathens
will give you no quarter.

00:15.465 --> 00:17.268
This does not sound
like a fun trip.

00:17.345 --> 00:19.036
Misty moors,
vague warnings.

00:19.113 --> 00:20.621
Sneaking out behind
Uncle Donald's back?

00:20.698 --> 00:22.448
Can you please
just tell us where we're going?

00:22.525 --> 00:24.218
The less you know,
the better.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073

00:34.840 --> 00:36.070
Wow, that's a good one!

00:36.147 --> 00:38.627
Aah! How long have you
been there watching me?

00:38.704 --> 00:39.864
25, 30 minutes.

00:39.941 --> 00:41.332
You still haven't
told your brothers

00:41.409 --> 00:42.710
what we found out
about your mom?

00:42.787 --> 00:44.470
Tell them what exactly?

00:44.547 --> 00:46.134
She took the Spear of Selene?

00:46.211 --> 00:47.501
We have no idea
what that means.

00:47.578 --> 00:49.015
We don't even know
what it looks like.

00:49.092 --> 00:50.107
Why get them in a panic

00:50.184 --> 00:51.651
when this could
all be a dead end?

00:51.728 --> 00:54.575
Because... honesty?

00:54.652 --> 00:57.376
Mmm. Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

00:57.453 --> 00:59.665
- Why do you always do that?
- Do what?

00:59.742 --> 01:01.482
Whenever you want
to ignore something,

01:01.559 --> 01:03.863
you stare into the distance
and pretend you're thinking.

01:03.940 --> 01:05.336
I'm trying
to protect my brothers

01:05.413 --> 01:07.185
from finding out something
that could upset them.

01:07.262 --> 01:09.268
And keeping an earth-shattering
secret from them

01:09.345 --> 01:12.019
that could destroy your
brotherhood wouldn't upset them?

01:12.096 --> 01:14.032
Mmm. Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

01:14.109 --> 01:15.327
Mm-hmm.

01:16.497 --> 01:17.662
Yaah!

01:18.349 --> 01:19.705
Found it!

01:20.586 --> 01:23.277
Launchpad, hide
the jeep in the moors.

01:25.266 --> 01:28.111
Every five years,
the mists of Dismal Downs

01:28.188 --> 01:30.048
part enough
to reveal the home

01:30.125 --> 01:32.507
of the Lost Treasure
of the Knights Templar.

01:32.584 --> 01:34.069
Brace yourselves, kids.

01:34.146 --> 01:36.368
Primordial menace
lurks here.

01:36.445 --> 01:39.467
The most treacherous
terror I've ever faced.

01:40.638 --> 01:42.532
Oi!
Jettison that jalopy

01:42.609 --> 01:45.472
from my driveway this
instant, you deadbeat!

01:45.796 --> 01:47.078

<font color=#FFFF00>"The Secrets of Castle McDuck"</font>

02:51.831 --> 02:52.984
Scroogey!

02:55.652 --> 02:56.807
- Son.
- Oh,

02:56.884 --> 02:58.616
look at ya wee bairns!

02:58.693 --> 03:00.559
- Finally I get to meet ya!
- Whoa!

03:00.636 --> 03:02.771
No, fine! I'm good!
Thank you, though!

03:03.428 --> 03:04.616
Uhh!

03:04.724 --> 03:07.848
Welcome, all of you,
to Castle McDuck!

03:07.925 --> 03:09.952
Your parents are alive?!

03:10.029 --> 03:12.004
I can't believe
you're still alive.

03:12.081 --> 03:13.506
He put a curse on us.

03:13.583 --> 03:14.889
That is not fair!

03:14.966 --> 03:18.811
I very kindly rebuilt our
ancestral castle for them.

03:18.888 --> 03:22.429
And I may have used some
discount mystical Druid stones

03:22.506 --> 03:24.902
that accidentally granted
them immortality.

03:24.979 --> 03:26.243
I didn't know
it would buy me

03:26.320 --> 03:28.117
and eternity's worth
of criticism.

03:28.194 --> 03:30.641
So he admits he wants
to be rid of us.

03:30.718 --> 03:32.700
Uch! Would you rather
I'd let you pass

03:32.777 --> 03:33.915
or made you immortal?

03:33.992 --> 03:35.379
Neither is satisfactory.

03:35.456 --> 03:37.327
A thoughtful son
would know that.

03:39.493 --> 03:43.187
So this is the actual home
of Clan McDuck?

03:43.264 --> 03:45.926
Indeed child.
Within these walls,

03:46.003 --> 03:50.782
lies the secrets and mysteries
of all your ancestors.

03:50.903 --> 03:53.142
Webby, there's gotta be
something about my mom here!

03:53.219 --> 03:54.344
Everything McDuck...

03:54.421 --> 03:57.146
Mysteries, secrets untold!

03:57.223 --> 04:00.814
Oooh-wheee!

04:02.400 --> 04:05.103
Uh-oh! She's having
a joy overload!

04:10.672 --> 04:11.920
Mmm!

04:16.236 --> 04:17.298
Hmph!

04:18.387 --> 04:19.647
We didn't know
where to send

04:19.724 --> 04:21.309
your birthday gifts
all these years

04:21.386 --> 04:23.415
with you
gallivanting about.

04:23.935 --> 04:26.092
Eh-Eh-Eh... thanks, Mummy.

04:26.169 --> 04:27.928
But I'm
not just traveling.

04:28.005 --> 04:29.698
I'm a seasoned adventurer,

04:29.775 --> 04:31.070
seeking fortune and...

04:31.147 --> 04:32.585
Sorry. Hi. Louie Duck,

04:32.662 --> 04:33.902
future owner
of this castle.

04:33.979 --> 04:36.307
The Templar Treasure,
like, can I have it now,

04:36.384 --> 04:38.426
or do I have to wait
to inherit it or...?

04:38.503 --> 04:40.702
Ah, so Scrooge mentioned
Simon's treasure,

04:40.779 --> 04:42.992
but didn't mention
his dear old parents, huh?

04:43.069 --> 04:45.694
- Simon?
- Simon McDuck was the accountant

04:45.771 --> 04:47.848
to the legendary
Knights Templar.

04:47.925 --> 04:50.934
He hid their treasure
somewhere in this castle.

04:51.011 --> 04:52.256
Typical Scrooge!

04:52.333 --> 04:53.755
Only coming around
looking for a handout.

04:53.832 --> 04:55.577
Heh heh heh heh.

04:55.654 --> 04:57.147
Only the Laird of the castle

04:57.224 --> 04:58.817
knows where
the Templar Treasure is,

04:58.894 --> 05:00.755
and the Laird won't tell me
where it is

05:00.832 --> 05:01.844
unless I'm worthy.

05:01.921 --> 05:03.358
- Hmm!
- So,

05:03.435 --> 05:04.997
we have to be
on our best behavior.

05:05.074 --> 05:06.551
Quit mentioning the treasure

05:06.628 --> 05:08.419
and act like
we want to be here.

05:08.496 --> 05:10.501
Ha ha! Whaaa!

05:11.515 --> 05:13.911
So, uh,
this place has info

05:13.988 --> 05:15.458
on all of our relatives?

05:15.535 --> 05:16.680
Oh, aye.

05:16.757 --> 05:20.153
There's Fergus's father,
Dirty Dingus McDuck.

05:21.674 --> 05:25.439
The ghosts of Clan McDuck
loom large here.

05:26.498 --> 05:29.343
This belonged
to Murdoch McDuck,

05:29.420 --> 05:31.528
first to patent
the longbow.

05:31.605 --> 05:33.661
Murdoch made a fortune
selling his bows

05:33.738 --> 05:35.199
to the English army.

05:35.276 --> 05:38.176
Of course, he charged
extra for the arrows.

05:40.224 --> 05:42.973
Sir Swamphole McDuck
was obsessed

05:43.050 --> 05:44.454
with hoarding treasure.

05:44.531 --> 05:45.509
Sound familiar?

05:45.586 --> 05:47.857
So he built a mysterious
series of tunnels

05:47.934 --> 05:51.262
under the castle
to keep the family fortune.

05:51.339 --> 05:53.952
Some say he summoned
a demon dog

05:54.029 --> 05:55.569
to stalk the catacombs.

05:56.730 --> 05:58.782
Oh, they're just stories,

05:58.912 --> 06:00.076
maybe,

06:00.326 --> 06:01.631
probably.

06:02.005 --> 06:04.577
Oh, and look here!

06:04.654 --> 06:06.669
Little Scroogey and Whiskers!

06:06.746 --> 06:07.724
Whiskers?

06:07.802 --> 06:10.146
Little Scroogey
always wanted a dog,

06:10.223 --> 06:11.635
but we were too poor,

06:11.712 --> 06:14.450
so we all pitched in
to buy a clump of hair

06:14.527 --> 06:16.184
from the local barber.

06:16.261 --> 06:20.244
Oh! How Scroogey
loved his Whiskers!

06:20.321 --> 06:22.669
Aye. And who ended up
having to walk him

06:22.746 --> 06:23.788
and feed him?

06:23.865 --> 06:25.163
It was a ball of hair!

06:25.240 --> 06:27.497
How dare you talk
about Whiskers like that?!

06:27.574 --> 06:28.676
He was family!

06:28.753 --> 06:29.936
Curse me kilts!

06:30.013 --> 06:31.968
Don't you curse
in front of your mother!

06:32.045 --> 06:33.585
I'm not a child anymore!

06:33.662 --> 06:35.173
Then stop acting like one!

06:36.137 --> 06:37.640
Arm wrestling match!

06:37.717 --> 06:39.642
You and me, right now!

06:41.849 --> 06:45.028
Fergus didn't mean anything
by that headlock, Scroogey.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.573
You know family
means everything to him.

06:47.650 --> 06:49.233
Oh, young Scrooge!

06:49.310 --> 06:51.278
Brooding teenage Scrooge!

06:51.355 --> 06:52.999
A baby Scrooge!

06:53.076 --> 06:54.725
See you at dinner!

06:56.344 --> 06:58.337
If it's family Daddy wants,

06:58.414 --> 07:00.327
it's family he'll get.

07:00.404 --> 07:02.086
That'll prove I'm worthy.

07:02.163 --> 07:03.653
Steel yourself, Webby!

07:03.730 --> 07:07.937
We are gonna have
a pleasant family dinner.

07:09.084 --> 07:11.243
Uncle Donald?!

07:15.009 --> 07:16.310
What?

07:16.966 --> 07:19.278
"If borrowed crown
is what you seek,

07:19.355 --> 07:22.158
then venture below
and follow your beak."

07:22.258 --> 07:23.382
Huh. Crown.

07:23.459 --> 07:24.520
Like a king's crown?

07:24.597 --> 07:26.928
Or a crown
like oldsy-timesy money.

07:27.005 --> 07:29.169
This could lead
to the Knights Templar treasure!

07:29.246 --> 07:31.482
"To ensure the arrow
miss its mark,

07:31.559 --> 07:32.906
pluck a ditty on an arc."

07:32.983 --> 07:34.439
Boys?!

07:35.013 --> 07:37.111
- Stall her.
- I'll fix the painting.

07:38.551 --> 07:40.968
This cold castle air's
made Huey's face numb.

07:41.045 --> 07:43.223
I don't suppose you'd
want to pinch his cheeks?

07:48.670 --> 07:50.202
This is
Mom's handwriting.

07:50.279 --> 07:51.911
This riddle could be
the key to finding her.

07:51.988 --> 07:53.304
I gotta solve it
before they do

07:53.381 --> 07:54.650
to make sure
it's nothing bad.

07:54.727 --> 07:55.779
Oh, mmm.

07:55.857 --> 07:57.319
All right, let's
solve a mystery!

07:57.396 --> 07:59.395
Just because there's a weird
riddle in a mystical castle

07:59.472 --> 08:00.677
doesn't mean
there's a mystery.

08:00.754 --> 08:02.184
- I see what you're doin'.
- You do?

08:02.261 --> 08:03.811
Tryin' to get
the jump on us,

08:03.888 --> 08:05.215
grab the treasure
for yourself?

08:05.292 --> 08:06.829
You're hidin' somethin',
aren't you?

08:06.906 --> 08:09.586
Mmm. Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm. Mmm.

08:09.663 --> 08:11.400
Come on!
We're in this together!

08:11.477 --> 08:14.104
The Duck Boys solving
a huge family secret!

08:14.560 --> 08:15.771
Oh, uh...

08:15.884 --> 08:16.932
Uh...

08:17.888 --> 08:19.248
Race you!

08:23.052 --> 08:24.286
"Pluck a ditty on an arc."

08:24.363 --> 08:25.561
Murdoch's longbow!

08:25.638 --> 08:27.426
Dewey! You passed
the first clue!

08:27.503 --> 08:29.458
Huh? I knew that!

08:29.535 --> 08:30.507
Hmmm.

08:30.584 --> 08:32.192
Some letters are capitalized.

08:32.269 --> 08:33.861
B, A, G.

08:33.991 --> 08:35.907
Are these musical notes?

08:40.226 --> 08:42.225
Ah, first chair cello,

08:42.302 --> 08:44.302
Junior Woodchuck
Philharmonic Orchestra.

08:48.035 --> 08:49.809
It's too narrow
for all three of us.

08:49.886 --> 08:51.387
Oh, bummer!

08:51.464 --> 08:53.370
Or we could just go
single file.

08:55.123 --> 08:57.017
Stupid smart Huey.

09:06.414 --> 09:09.059
This must be one of
Swamphole's crazy tunnels.

09:09.136 --> 09:11.421
Guys, this could be
dangerous or boring.

09:11.498 --> 09:13.046
You should totally go back.

09:13.123 --> 09:14.434
It's really not worth
the risk.

09:14.511 --> 09:17.118
That is the least Dewey thing
you've ever said!

09:19.201 --> 09:20.692
This is great, Mummy.

09:20.769 --> 09:24.202
Family sitting,
sharing a hot kidney pie.

09:24.279 --> 09:25.426
These are
the kind of values

09:25.503 --> 09:27.481
I try to instill
in my own family.

09:27.558 --> 09:30.632
Warm memories,
togetherness.

09:30.709 --> 09:32.275
Then where are the boys?

09:32.531 --> 09:36.114
Oh, probably off being
supportive of each other.

09:37.818 --> 09:39.747
- No, stop it!
- Get off of me!

09:39.824 --> 09:41.178
Well, Webby here

09:41.255 --> 09:44.126
is one of the most
articulate young lasses,

09:44.203 --> 09:46.376
and she is not here.

09:46.466 --> 09:48.154
I, uh...

09:48.232 --> 09:49.634
Hmmm, oh...

09:52.117 --> 09:55.249
Aye, you're a real
family man, aren't ya?

09:55.326 --> 09:58.878
I will have you know...
Hmm.

09:59.016 --> 10:00.147
Brring brring.

10:00.224 --> 10:01.765
Oh! Um, oh, uh!

10:01.842 --> 10:04.181
Hello? What?
Oh, you're here

10:04.258 --> 10:05.349
in Dismal Downs!

10:05.426 --> 10:06.776
Oh, what a surprise!

10:06.853 --> 10:08.800
Of course,
I'll be right out.

10:13.578 --> 10:17.046
Mummy, Daddy,
say hello to your great-nephew

10:17.123 --> 10:20.731
and my beloved ward
Donald!

10:21.695 --> 10:24.252
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!

10:24.329 --> 10:25.417
Quack!

10:34.742 --> 10:37.152
"Penetrate the door bifold..."

10:39.713 --> 10:42.071
"with only
the purest key of gold."

10:42.148 --> 10:43.996
Where are we gonna find...
Whoa!

10:46.976 --> 10:48.602
Oh, man!

10:48.680 --> 10:50.796
How we gonna find
one gold key in all this?

10:50.873 --> 10:52.416
Well, good try, everyone.

10:52.493 --> 10:54.367
You should head back.
Way to go.

10:54.592 --> 10:55.616
Found it!

10:55.703 --> 10:57.469
Real gold weighs more
than fool's gold,

10:57.546 --> 10:58.873
so you just search
the bottom of the pile.

10:58.950 --> 11:00.584
You know, check the luster
and the karat quality,

11:00.661 --> 11:02.080
and, boom, pure gold key.

11:02.361 --> 11:03.998
What?
You like nerd stuff.

11:04.075 --> 11:06.110
I like gold. Come on.

11:11.936 --> 11:13.857
How am I supposed to protect
them from the truth

11:13.934 --> 11:15.916
if they keep helping me
find it?

11:20.491 --> 11:22.873
Looking a little
beefier, Donald.

11:22.950 --> 11:25.050
Eating a lot
these days, are you?

11:25.127 --> 11:26.121
Um.

11:26.199 --> 11:27.630
Oh, yeah.
Thanks to Mister...

11:27.707 --> 11:29.718
Er, Uncle McDee.

11:29.973 --> 11:32.300
He's a saint.
Took me and the boys in.

11:32.377 --> 11:33.936
Even let Donald...

11:34.013 --> 11:36.398
me park his...

11:36.480 --> 11:38.962
my houseboat
in the pool.

11:39.039 --> 11:42.000
He's a real family man,
or my name isn't Launchpad Mc...

11:42.199 --> 11:43.780
Donald Duck.

11:43.910 --> 11:45.611
Quack?

11:48.615 --> 11:50.278
Ehhh...

11:50.356 --> 11:52.137
Oh, no!

11:55.441 --> 11:56.592
Why I oughta!

11:56.669 --> 11:58.248
Oh! There he is!

11:58.325 --> 11:59.951
Quack! Quack! Quack!

12:00.028 --> 12:01.495
Oh, quack quack!

12:01.572 --> 12:04.187
Poor lad.
Of course you're confused.

12:04.264 --> 12:06.745
Living like an animal
in Scrooge's yard.

12:06.822 --> 12:07.785
For shame.

12:07.863 --> 12:10.325
I take great care
of my family.

12:10.402 --> 12:12.247
You avoid us
like the plague!

12:12.324 --> 12:15.036
Oh, come now,
that's unfair to the plague!

12:15.113 --> 12:16.644
That's it!
Go to your room!

12:16.721 --> 12:18.630
I never lived here!

12:18.707 --> 12:21.394
Then pick the one furthest
away from my line of sight!

12:21.471 --> 12:23.867
Fine by me!

12:26.783 --> 12:28.588
More sheep's bladder?

12:28.665 --> 12:29.922
Mmm...

12:30.113 --> 12:31.426
yes.

12:32.448 --> 12:34.117
Oh, that man!

12:34.194 --> 12:36.951
Money, success, family,
it's never enough!

12:37.028 --> 12:39.201
He'll never help me find
the blasted treasure!

12:41.168 --> 12:43.272
You're right.
He never helped me before.

12:43.349 --> 12:44.448
Why start now?

12:44.525 --> 12:46.229
I'm Scrooge McDuck!

12:46.306 --> 12:47.810
I did everything else
on my own!

12:47.887 --> 12:49.573
I'll find that treasure
on my own!

12:49.650 --> 12:50.651
Good talk, Webby.

13:05.725 --> 13:07.784
The Crypt of Clan McDuck!

13:07.861 --> 13:10.232
The final resting place
of all our ancestors!

13:10.309 --> 13:11.867
But how do we know
which is the right tomb?

13:11.944 --> 13:13.961
Uh, I may
have found a clue.

13:16.970 --> 13:19.747
Has Uncle Donald been a
ghost this whole time?

13:19.824 --> 13:22.265
No. He gets hurt way too often
to be a ghost.

13:22.342 --> 13:24.847
Wait. The riddle was hidden
on a portrait of Uncle Donald.

13:24.924 --> 13:27.133
Which means it was
meant for him.

13:27.707 --> 13:30.559
"Face <i> your</i> fate,
confront <i> your</i> doom."

13:30.636 --> 13:33.155
They wanted Uncle Donald
to find his own grave!

13:33.232 --> 13:34.519
That is messed up.

13:34.596 --> 13:36.099
So what's in there?

13:36.176 --> 13:37.593
Could be the treasure!

13:38.250 --> 13:39.255
Uh-huh... Uh!

13:39.332 --> 13:40.529
W-w-wait! Wait wait wait!

13:40.606 --> 13:42.167
I mean, what if there's
something or someone

13:42.244 --> 13:43.512
we don't want to find?

13:43.589 --> 13:45.097
Louie, Louie,
aren't you scared?

13:45.174 --> 13:47.000
Eh, greed beats fear
every time.

13:50.840 --> 13:52.332
Oh!

13:52.445 --> 13:53.976
Oh! It's empty.

13:56.443 --> 13:58.093
Just a beat-up old bag.

14:07.097 --> 14:10.664
Aah! The Demon Dog
of Castle McDuck!

14:16.268 --> 14:17.287
Aaah!

14:17.364 --> 14:19.222
We need a distraction!

14:19.299 --> 14:20.690
Hey, give it back!

14:20.767 --> 14:22.247
Louie, hold the door open!

14:22.324 --> 14:25.255
I'll set the scarf on fire
and throw it out as a decoy!

14:25.332 --> 14:26.659
Uhh... No!

14:26.777 --> 14:27.898
You can't!

14:27.975 --> 14:29.091
What is wrong with you?!

14:29.168 --> 14:30.409
Why are you being
super weird?!

14:30.486 --> 14:32.047
This is a bad time
to be weird!

14:34.550 --> 14:36.468
Because it belongs to Mom!

14:37.839 --> 14:40.763
Moldy old codger says I
don't care about family!

14:40.840 --> 14:42.888
He walked Whiskers,
but who loved Whiskers?

14:46.647 --> 14:49.883
Secret passage
in the hallway.

14:49.960 --> 14:52.022
Nice try, Daddy!

14:54.768 --> 14:56.224
- Aah!
- I told you

14:56.301 --> 14:57.844
to stay in your room.

14:58.156 --> 14:59.915
I don't care
what you have to say!

14:59.992 --> 15:02.943
Well, I won't tell you where
the Templar Treasure is then.

15:03.020 --> 15:04.691
I've never needed
your help before,

15:04.768 --> 15:07.258
and I don't need it nooow!

15:09.361 --> 15:10.637
Kids.

15:12.067 --> 15:13.067
Hmph!

15:16.489 --> 15:18.286
- Aah!
- Aah!

15:20.424 --> 15:22.353
How do you know this is Mom's?

15:22.431 --> 15:26.115
I've, uh, kind of been
researching her on my own.

15:26.192 --> 15:28.652
A little. I mean, I just
searched a forbidden library,

15:28.729 --> 15:29.888
crashed the Sunchaser,

15:29.965 --> 15:31.496
talked to the goddess Selene.

15:31.573 --> 15:33.863
Okay. You know,
hearing it out loud,

15:33.940 --> 15:36.183
it comes off way worse
than it sounded in my brain.

15:36.260 --> 15:38.036
How could you keep
this from us?

15:38.113 --> 15:39.466
I was trying to protect you

15:39.543 --> 15:41.277
from a potentially
devastating revelation.

15:43.016 --> 15:44.449
Or you just kept it
to yourself

15:44.526 --> 15:45.597
so you can feel special.

15:45.674 --> 15:46.766
Classic Dewey!

15:46.843 --> 15:48.290
She's our Mom!

15:48.367 --> 15:50.552
Okay, it's just...
first I didn't tell you

15:50.629 --> 15:51.863
because I didn't want you
to get hurt.

15:51.940 --> 15:53.076
Then I couldn't tell you

15:53.153 --> 15:54.167
because I found out
all this stuff

15:54.244 --> 15:55.564
and I didn't want you
to hurt me.

15:55.641 --> 15:56.833
I'm sorry, okay?

15:56.910 --> 15:59.133
You're only sorry
'cause you got caught!

16:05.038 --> 16:06.943
Louie, are you okay?

16:07.246 --> 16:09.781
You kept a secret
about Mom.

16:10.856 --> 16:12.985
That is not okay.

16:15.476 --> 16:16.893
Aah!

16:28.848 --> 16:29.852
This way!

16:35.668 --> 16:37.193
Would you wait up, lad?

16:37.270 --> 16:39.241
My legs aren't
so young anymore.

16:39.318 --> 16:42.185
Aha! If I'm right,
under this moss

16:42.262 --> 16:44.546
is the tip
of a Templar insignia.

16:45.981 --> 16:48.371
No! You have to go
against the moss.

16:48.448 --> 16:49.981
Just stop!

16:50.117 --> 16:52.687
I don't need you!

16:53.220 --> 16:54.316
Everything I earned,

16:54.393 --> 16:55.761
I earned through
my own hard work.

16:55.838 --> 16:57.656
You never gave me
anything!

16:57.733 --> 16:59.080
I gave you that.

16:59.962 --> 17:01.785
My Number One Dime?

17:01.862 --> 17:04.271
Burt the ditch digger
gave it to me.

17:04.348 --> 17:06.041
<i>Back in my shoeshine days,</i>

17:06.118 --> 17:08.545
<i>I worked for hours
on Burt's boots.</i>

17:08.622 --> 17:11.049
<i>He paid me with
an American dime.</i>

17:12.539 --> 17:14.596
Who do you think
gave him the dime?

17:14.673 --> 17:15.684
What?

17:15.942 --> 17:18.992
<i>Aye, I muddied his boots.</i>

17:20.487 --> 17:22.375
<i>And sent him your way.</i>

17:25.285 --> 17:26.377
Wait. What?!

17:26.454 --> 17:28.042
But why?

17:28.223 --> 17:29.294
We were poor.

17:29.371 --> 17:30.684
I couldn't provide
for you myself,

17:30.761 --> 17:32.515
so... I had to give you
a different gift...

17:32.592 --> 17:33.919
Self-reliance,

17:33.996 --> 17:36.228
teaching you to work hard
and fend for yourself

17:36.305 --> 17:38.625
so that you'd become
the man you are now.

17:40.450 --> 17:42.402
But you learned
that lesson so well,

17:42.479 --> 17:44.062
we hardly saw you again.

17:45.051 --> 17:46.836
If I'm hard on you, lad,

17:46.919 --> 17:48.625
it's 'cause I miss you is all.

17:49.090 --> 17:51.912
Oh, Daddy,
I miss you, too.

17:54.952 --> 17:56.116
Hmm?

17:57.744 --> 17:59.195
Hmm!

18:04.024 --> 18:05.424
What?

18:12.440 --> 18:15.012
Let's finally open it
together, eh?

18:20.830 --> 18:23.139
- Bless me bagpipes.
- Bless me bagpipes.

18:26.308 --> 18:27.771
"Dear Fergus,

18:27.848 --> 18:29.299
lookin' for a handout?

18:29.376 --> 18:31.582
Nice try,
you lazy loafer.

18:31.659 --> 18:33.689
Keep searchin'
for the treasure, sonny.

18:33.766 --> 18:36.572
Maybe you'll actually
learn how to save money

18:36.649 --> 18:38.126
if you have to earn it.

18:38.203 --> 18:41.506
Your Da, Dirty Dingus."

18:43.196 --> 18:46.059
Loafer? This was a decoy
the whole time!

18:46.136 --> 18:47.931
I cannae win
with that old codger!

18:52.028 --> 18:54.151
Huey! Louie!
Where are you?!

18:54.228 --> 18:56.044
I should have told you!

18:56.121 --> 18:57.941
I'm sorry!
I need your help!

19:24.619 --> 19:25.944
Aah!

19:29.188 --> 19:30.236
- Aah!
- Scram!

19:30.313 --> 19:32.322
- Shoo!
- Back up! Back up, you dog!

19:32.399 --> 19:33.522
Not food!
We're not food!

19:33.599 --> 19:35.734
Back up!
You came back!

19:35.811 --> 19:36.862
We're the Duck Boys!

19:36.939 --> 19:38.390
Good or bad,
whatever we do,

19:38.467 --> 19:39.914
we do it together!

19:49.265 --> 19:52.237
Yaah!

19:53.733 --> 19:56.544
Duck Family
victorious!

19:56.621 --> 19:58.661
It worked?! It worked!

19:58.738 --> 20:01.179
We gotta start doin'
that all the time!

20:02.275 --> 20:04.067
Ach, forget the treasure.

20:04.144 --> 20:06.546
Who needs treasure
when we've got each other?

20:09.121 --> 20:10.645
Please! We're McDucks!

20:10.722 --> 20:12.909
But what say next time
I come back,

20:12.986 --> 20:14.268
we find it together?

20:14.345 --> 20:16.804
You got yourself
a deal, Scroogey.

20:20.011 --> 20:21.150
Uncle Donald's hat.

20:21.227 --> 20:23.034
That must be the borrowed crown
from the riddle!

20:23.111 --> 20:24.942
So Mom took his hat,
hid it,

20:25.019 --> 20:26.990
and the elaborate riddles
in the catacombs

20:27.067 --> 20:28.437
and the deadly Demon Dog
were...

20:28.514 --> 20:32.593
Were all just an elaborate
prank on Uncle Donald?

20:38.808 --> 20:40.942
I should have told you
from the beginning.

20:41.136 --> 20:43.452
Good or bad,
we're all in this together.

20:45.472 --> 20:47.714
Well, I guess we're
all starting from scratch.

20:47.791 --> 20:49.659
Wait. Did you rub
a pencil over this?

20:49.736 --> 20:51.573
- Buh?
- Have I taught you nothing?

20:51.650 --> 20:53.197
Junior Woodchuck
Rule 217...

20:53.274 --> 20:55.062
Rub all documents
with a pencil.

20:58.428 --> 21:00.287
The Spear of Selene!

21:00.365 --> 21:01.837
Now we know
what it looks like!

21:01.914 --> 21:03.301
Is that a date circled?

21:03.378 --> 21:05.113
- April 15, 20...
- Guys,

21:05.190 --> 21:06.438
this is the week
we were born!

21:06.515 --> 21:07.542
What does that mean?

21:07.619 --> 21:09.319
We'll find out... together.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.395
Oh, man,
I gotta tell Webby!

21:11.472 --> 21:13.596
Ooh! By the way,
Webby knows, too.

21:13.673 --> 21:14.831
- Come on!
- Dude!

21:14.908 --> 21:17.721
Sorry. Total honesty
from here on out.

21:19.552 --> 21:21.186
Mmm!

21:22.355 --> 21:25.128
- Mmm!
- Mmm!

21:27.464 --> 21:29.831
Now, are you sure there's
nothing I can give you?

21:29.908 --> 21:31.791
Maybe some original
family photographs

21:31.868 --> 21:33.997
or a leather-bound volume
of McDuck history.

21:34.074 --> 21:36.057
I'm probably just gonna
throw most of it away anyway.

21:36.134 --> 21:38.542
I... Words... Can't...

21:38.619 --> 21:39.905
Ahh!

21:41.558 --> 21:42.969
Well, goodbye then.

21:43.046 --> 21:44.331
See you all
in five years.

21:47.211 --> 21:48.536
Who built this castle?!

21:48.613 --> 21:49.899
What was Scrooge like
as a kid?!

21:49.976 --> 21:52.331
What was his favorite color,
game, song, food?!

21:52.408 --> 21:54.042
Who designed
the McDuck tartan?!

21:54.119 --> 21:59.663
Who was... Nooooo!
