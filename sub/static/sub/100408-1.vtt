He protects me at night
and tells me stories.

scare the crap out of me.

what're you doing?

15:19.396 --> 15:20.702

15:20.745 --> 15:22.704
He left my room before
tucking me in.

15:22.747 --> 15:24.227

just trying to scare me.

15:24.271 --> 15:25.489

15:36.283 --> 15:38.111
Freakshow is right
where you left him.

15:48.469 --> 15:49.687
Are you playing
tricks on me now?

- I heard noises.

16:30.946 --> 16:32.295

I'm definitely calling your dad!

16:36.821 --> 16:37.648
Come on, Eric.

16:42.131 --> 16:43.176

be home soon.

Oh my God, what seems to
be the matter?

17:46.848 --> 17:50.417
- Ha, anyways, I don't mean
to interrupt your night out.

17:50.460 --> 17:52.854

bumped into a couple

17:52.897 --> 17:55.204
of her book club friends,
so I'm just sitting here

17:55.248 --> 17:55.857

- Don't worry, I'll deal
with her when we get home.

18:07.303 --> 18:08.739
- She's never been that
way with me before.

18:08.783 --> 18:11.220
She was going crazy
about her clown friend,

18:11.264 --> 18:12.830
how he was missing.

18:12.874 --> 18:14.267

Riley, go upstairs and
get the kids now!

Oh.

25:48.459 --> 25:49.591

25:49.635 --> 25:51.071
We have a couple of

something to do with this?

25:53.769 --> 25:55.989
Is she involved in some way?

25:56.032 --> 25:58.687

in lipstick in the house.

25:58.731 --> 26:00.167
- Well what did it say?

26:00.210 --> 26:01.995

one can get in our way."

26:02.038 --> 26:03.474
Does that mean anything to you?

26:03.518 --> 26:06.347

it couldn't be!

26:06.390 --> 26:08.262
- Come with us down to the
station and fill out a
statement.

26:08.305 --> 26:11.134
We'll do everything in
our power to help you out.

26:11.178 --> 26:13.833
[ominous music]

26:15.269 --> 26:18.228
[crickets chirping]

26:27.847 --> 26:30.240
[engine rumbling]

26:30.284 --> 26:33.504
Laurie, don't worry, we're
gonna get to the bottom of this.

26:33.548 --> 26:34.897
- It's not a cop!

26:34.941 --> 26:38.031
Get out of the car, the
cop's a killer!

26:38.074 --> 26:43.036
[sinister music]
[police siren alarming]

26:47.867 --> 26:49.129
[Riley screaming]

26:49.172 --> 26:51.261
Get out of the car, he's
gonna kill you!

26:51.305 --> 26:52.262
It's him!

26:52.306 --> 26:53.873
Get out of the car!

26:56.136 --> 26:58.486
[screaming]

27:02.055 --> 27:04.405
[laughing]

27:08.104 --> 27:09.715
- [Laurie] Let me out!

27:09.758 --> 27:12.500
[sinister music]

27:17.853 --> 27:19.942
- Okay, this is wrong, we
shouldn't be doing this crap.

27:19.986 --> 27:21.509
- Chill out, Frank.

27:21.552 --> 27:22.945
- I'm chill.

27:22.989 --> 27:25.078
We should not be messing
around with this book anymore.

27:25.121 --> 27:26.514
- Are you kidding me?

27:26.557 --> 27:28.995
This is the greatest thing
that's ever happened to us.

27:29.038 --> 27:30.170
This thing is amazing.

27:30.213 --> 27:31.519
Look at it.

27:31.562 --> 27:33.260
It's a relic.

27:33.303 --> 27:35.175
- So, are you okay with this?

27:35.218 --> 27:38.308
- I mean, it's kinda
creepy but I'm having fun.

27:41.529 --> 27:42.835
- So you wanna stay?

27:42.878 --> 27:45.098
- Yeah, we have to see
how this plays out, Frank.

27:45.141 --> 27:47.361
- Come on, Frank, just sit down,

27:47.404 --> 27:49.580
we're moving on to the next one.

27:49.624 --> 27:51.539
Natalie will protect you.

27:54.281 --> 27:56.065
- What the fuck did you
do that for, Frank?!

27:56.109 --> 28:00.809
[ghostly whispering]
[gasping]

28:01.331 --> 28:03.594
[sizzling]

28:05.596 --> 28:06.728
- Jody, no!

28:06.772 --> 28:07.555
- It's fine.

28:07.598 --> 28:09.209
It's not even hot.

28:11.037 --> 28:12.778
- Oh, it's still perfect.

28:12.821 --> 28:14.693
They really knew how to make
these things back in the day,

28:14.736 --> 28:15.563
didn't they?

28:18.784 --> 28:21.743
- Okay, are we ready to
keep going now?

28:21.787 --> 28:23.484
- I really don't think that--

28:23.527 --> 28:26.661
- Can you just try and
have some fun, please?

28:28.968 --> 28:30.099
- Yeah, I guess.

28:31.361 --> 28:32.188
For the record, I mean--

28:32.232 --> 28:34.625
- For the record, we get it.

28:34.669 --> 28:35.714
Can we keep going?

28:37.367 --> 28:38.281
- Yeah.

28:38.325 --> 28:39.674
Yeah, proceed.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.154
- Okay, thank you.

28:41.197 --> 28:41.981
Jody, it's your turn to read.

28:42.024 --> 28:43.460
- I don't know about you,

28:43.504 --> 28:46.420
but I see some sparks
flying over here.

28:46.463 --> 28:47.290
- Just read.

28:48.465 --> 28:51.642
- Okay, story time,
boys and girls.

28:55.646 --> 28:58.649
This one's called "The
Gypsy's Curse."

28:58.693 --> 29:01.174
[eerie music]

29:06.570 --> 29:09.486
[enchanting music]

30:01.538 --> 30:04.933
[rollercoaster rumbling]

30:08.458 --> 30:10.983
- I think we pretty
much killed it.

30:11.026 --> 30:12.985
We rode every ride twice.

30:13.028 --> 30:15.683
You beat me at every game
at least once.

30:15.726 --> 30:16.771
Home time?

30:16.815 --> 30:18.729
- I think you're
forgetting one thing.

30:18.773 --> 30:21.863
- No, no, we did the bumper
cars, the Ferris wheel.

30:21.907 --> 30:23.082
- Uh-huh.

30:23.125 --> 30:24.779
- I hate to tell you
this, I think that's it.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.781
- Oh, I hate to tell
you this honey

30:26.825 --> 30:29.044
but how will I ever know
that you're really the one

30:29.088 --> 30:32.656
unless the great and
powerful Olga tells me so?

30:33.657 --> 30:35.094
- You're kidding, right?

30:35.137 --> 30:36.660
You don't believe in that crap.

30:39.272 --> 30:41.448
[sighing]

30:46.670 --> 30:48.368
[man clearing throat]

30:48.411 --> 30:49.891
- Oh, sorry.

30:49.935 --> 30:52.198
We'd like two fortunes told,
please.

30:52.241 --> 30:53.112
- Only one.

30:53.155 --> 30:53.939
- What?

30:54.940 --> 30:55.941
- [Man] Only one at time.

30:55.984 --> 30:57.246
- What did he say?

30:57.290 --> 30:59.858
- I think he means only
one at a time can go in.

30:59.901 --> 31:01.337
Is that right, only one?

31:01.381 --> 31:02.730
- Is correct.

31:02.773 --> 31:04.427
- "Is correct."

31:04.471 --> 31:05.385
Did you get that?

31:05.428 --> 31:07.126
- Yeah, I'll go in first

31:07.169 --> 31:09.345
but depending what she
says in there,

31:09.389 --> 31:10.651
I might be going home
alone tonight.

31:10.694 --> 31:12.653
- Aw, don't be mean.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.572
I'll just hang out with Lurch.

31:20.487 --> 31:21.705
Good luck.

31:23.011 --> 31:25.884
So, you got any hobbies?

31:25.927 --> 31:26.754
Basketball?

31:28.103 --> 31:30.758
[ominous music]

31:33.369 --> 31:34.805
- You sit.

31:34.849 --> 31:36.242
You sit.

31:36.285 --> 31:37.678
- Are you Olga?

31:37.721 --> 31:41.856
- You sit and Olga will
tell you all she sees.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.336
- Okay, I'll sit.

31:46.121 --> 31:48.036
- Good, good.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.385
A tea for you, my dear?

31:49.429 --> 31:50.256
- Yes, please.

31:55.217 --> 31:58.394
- Is boyfriend of
yours man outside?

31:58.438 --> 31:59.569
- Yes, Kyle.

32:01.615 --> 32:03.443
- Please, no need.

32:03.486 --> 32:04.531
Olga sees all.

32:07.186 --> 32:09.188
- This is fun, thank you.

32:09.231 --> 32:12.495
- Now, we get to the
bottom was what you seek

32:12.539 --> 32:15.934
and what you seek is the future.

32:15.977 --> 32:17.892
- I'd love to hear
anything you can tell me.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.067
Do I become a lawyer?

32:19.111 --> 32:20.634
Do Kyle and I end up together?

32:20.677 --> 32:23.028
- In time, child, in time.

32:23.071 --> 32:25.247
- Sure, what do we do?

32:25.291 --> 32:27.771
- First, the future is
not for free.

32:27.815 --> 32:29.817
Five dollars, if you please.

32:29.860 --> 32:31.297
- Oh, of course.

32:36.955 --> 32:40.132
- You close eyes when
I tell you but first,

32:43.178 --> 32:45.572
I will teach you to see.

32:45.615 --> 32:47.922
- Is that how you
see the future?

32:47.966 --> 32:50.359
- Close your eyes, child.

32:50.403 --> 32:51.970
Olga sees all.

32:54.320 --> 32:57.366
Now, take in a deep breath

32:57.410 --> 33:00.021
Breathe in as deeply as you can

33:00.065 --> 33:03.633
and let go only when you must.

33:10.423 --> 33:13.556
I see a very beautiful woman.

33:13.600 --> 33:16.603
She is bearing a red coat.

33:16.646 --> 33:18.126
- My mom.

33:18.170 --> 33:19.649
- Yes, child.

33:19.693 --> 33:23.697
She is holding a tiny
baby in her arms.

33:23.740 --> 33:27.396
On this day, she knows love.

33:27.440 --> 33:29.268
- I miss her so much.

33:29.311 --> 33:32.575
- I see no man in this picture.

33:32.619 --> 33:34.751
Where is your father, my dear?

33:34.795 --> 33:36.710
- He left us before I was born.

33:36.753 --> 33:38.016
He didn't want me.

33:38.059 --> 33:40.975
- You must forgive
yourself for this!

33:41.019 --> 33:44.239
The sins of the father
do not belong to you!

33:45.197 --> 33:46.328
- I know, I'm trying.

33:48.461 --> 33:50.637
- The happiness you seek--

33:50.680 --> 33:52.334
- What do I have to do?

33:52.378 --> 33:53.509
- Close your eyes dear.

33:54.467 --> 33:55.424
- Sorry.

33:57.165 --> 33:59.515
- The boy that you
bring here today.

33:59.559 --> 34:00.951
- Yes?

34:00.995 --> 34:04.607
- Is a good man, he is
very good for you.

34:04.651 --> 34:09.612
But I see wings of
steel in the sky.

34:09.656 --> 34:11.658
Are you going on a trip?

34:11.701 --> 34:13.442
- New college in the fall.

34:13.485 --> 34:17.925
- When you leave, your
relationship will suffer.

34:17.967 --> 34:20.580
He does not want you to go.

34:20.623 --> 34:23.016
- I know, he keeps
forgetting pamphlets

34:23.061 --> 34:24.757
for our college at my house.

34:24.801 --> 34:26.672
He says he's happy for me but--

34:27.891 --> 34:29.937
- [Olga] He loves you very much.

34:29.980 --> 34:30.893
- I know he does.

34:30.938 --> 34:33.071
- Is not so simple.

34:33.114 --> 34:36.378
When you go, it will be
too much for him.

34:36.422 --> 34:37.639
- What are you saying?

34:37.684 --> 34:39.467
If I go, he'll leave me?

34:40.730 --> 34:43.820
- The only thing that is clear,
my child,

34:43.864 --> 34:47.389
is that you have many big
decisions ahead of you.

34:48.347 --> 34:49.652
- Will we stay together?

34:49.696 --> 34:50.914
You need to tell me.

34:56.005 --> 34:57.530
- [Olga] No.

34:57.573 --> 34:58.400
- What?!

34:58.444 --> 34:59.227
What is it?!

34:59.271 --> 35:00.576
Tell me what you see!

35:00.620 --> 35:03.057
- Olga does not like
what she sees.

35:03.101 --> 35:04.493
- Please, you have to tell me!

35:04.537 --> 35:06.016
I want to know!

35:06.060 --> 35:09.933
- Olga is not certain that
you want to know this future.

35:09.977 --> 35:12.762
- Just tell me what you
see as you see it!

35:12.806 --> 35:15.200
I want to know my future!

35:15.243 --> 35:18.986
- I see clouds of darkness
in your future.

35:19.029 --> 35:23.033
You will feel pain like
no other will feel pain.

35:23.077 --> 35:27.777
In place of joy and love,
you will only experience

35:27.821 --> 35:30.345
hardships and a broken heart.

35:30.389 --> 35:33.305
When you leave, the
love from this boy

35:33.348 --> 35:34.436
will quickly evaporate.

35:36.612 --> 35:40.790
You are cursed for a
life of despair.

35:42.009 --> 35:46.100
You will feel the shame
of an outcast.

35:46.144 --> 35:50.452
Born into a harsh and
cruel world,

35:50.496 --> 35:53.716
not knowing idea of love.

35:55.501 --> 35:58.765
This is what awaits you.

35:58.808 --> 36:01.246
There is no hope for you

36:02.551 --> 36:06.120
to avoid of the collision
course of the life

36:06.164 --> 36:07.861
that you have been born into.

36:07.904 --> 36:11.299
- Please, no, there must
be something you can do.

36:11.343 --> 36:14.128
I must have some sort of
choice in this.

36:14.172 --> 36:17.827
- Olga is afraid that
it is too late for that.

36:17.871 --> 36:20.526
Your future is smeared in black.

36:20.569 --> 36:24.182
There is a curse above you
that lives above you forever.

36:24.225 --> 36:26.401
This is your path.

36:26.445 --> 36:28.838
- What is this, some sort
of joke to you?

36:28.882 --> 36:30.318
I want my fortune told!

36:30.362 --> 36:32.102
A good fortune!

36:32.146 --> 36:33.321
I paid the money.

36:35.280 --> 36:38.718
- We do not have a decision
upon our future, my dear.

36:39.806 --> 36:41.111
- Fuck you, Olga!

36:41.155 --> 36:42.243
I'm done!

36:42.287 --> 36:45.115
[laughing]

36:45.159 --> 36:47.161
- Hey, my turn now.

36:47.205 --> 36:48.423
Was it good?

36:48.467 --> 36:49.250
What'd she say?

36:51.034 --> 36:52.210
- Can we go home please?

36:53.428 --> 36:54.255
- [Kyle] What happened in there?

36:54.299 --> 36:55.778
- Can you just take me home?

36:57.476 --> 36:58.259
- Okay.

37:00.087 --> 37:01.393
What'd she say?

37:01.436 --> 37:04.265
- [Lydnsy] Nothing, I
don't wanna talk about it.

37:04.309 --> 37:07.660
- Well, did she
something bad about me?

37:07.703 --> 37:11.229
Because I feel like you're
throwing anger towards me.

37:11.272 --> 37:12.665
- Just stop asking.

37:12.708 --> 37:14.884
I just don't wanna
talk about it.

37:14.928 --> 37:16.146
- [Kyle] Hey, cheer up.

37:16.190 --> 37:17.626
It's supposed to be for fun.

37:17.670 --> 37:19.933
You don't actually
believe that shit, do you?

37:19.976 --> 37:22.544
- [Lydnsy] Well, yeah, I
was excited to go in there.

37:27.288 --> 37:29.986
- Hey, can we just chat
for a second?

37:30.030 --> 37:30.857
- I don't really feel
like talking.

37:37.167 --> 37:38.299
- [Kyle] Text me later?

37:39.822 --> 37:42.477
[ominous music]

38:09.983 --> 38:13.465
[eerie music box chiming]

38:33.267 --> 38:35.051
[thunder rumbling]

38:35.095 --> 38:36.270
- Don't!

38:36.314 --> 38:38.968
[alarm beeping]

38:44.844 --> 38:47.150
[muffled screaming]

38:47.194 --> 38:49.936
[water faucet running]

38:49.979 --> 38:52.242
[gurgling]

39:01.208 --> 39:02.514
- What the fuck?

39:05.081 --> 39:07.257
[sighing]

39:13.394 --> 39:16.484
[school bell ringing]

39:21.315 --> 39:22.142
Hey, Rach.

39:26.102 --> 39:27.843
- Join us as we journey
through space and time

39:27.887 --> 39:29.367
and unravel the secrets
of the universe

39:29.410 --> 39:30.890
to discuss the most
pressing matter

39:30.933 --> 39:32.195
in the scientific world to date.

39:32.239 --> 39:33.980
That time travel is sick!

39:34.023 --> 39:35.460
- Sick!

39:35.503 --> 39:38.114
- It is real, it is totally
amazing and it's possible.

55:19.881 --> 55:21.492
Is that all right?

55:23.755 --> 55:25.887
- Sure, works for us.

55:25.931 --> 55:26.801
- Okay.

55:26.845 --> 55:28.455
Then let's get you signed in.

55:29.804 --> 55:31.893
- [Young Man] You got
any pubs around here?

55:32.807 --> 55:34.069
- We do.

55:34.113 --> 55:35.462
[speaking foreign language]

55:35.506 --> 55:38.030
Of the "Wobbly Pub" in English.

55:38.073 --> 55:39.510
It's right next door, actually.

55:41.076 --> 55:44.602
Thought it might not be exactly
what you're looking for.

55:44.645 --> 55:47.300
[laughing]

55:47.344 --> 55:50.129
So, where are you
gentlemen coming from?

55:51.043 --> 55:51.826
- Michigan.

55:51.870 --> 55:52.740
- She speaks!

55:54.525 --> 55:56.135
- Michigan.

55:56.178 --> 55:57.310
Americans then.

55:58.485 --> 55:59.660
What brings you all the
way to Delft?

55:59.704 --> 56:01.619
Maastricht is only an hour away.

56:01.662 --> 56:02.794
- We just came from there.

56:02.837 --> 56:04.491
We're hitchhiking to Amsterdam

56:04.535 --> 56:07.102
but our ride isn't
leaving until the morning.

56:07.146 --> 56:09.714
- I see.

56:09.757 --> 56:12.151
Delft is a nice place
to stay for the night.

56:13.065 --> 56:15.284
We might be small

56:15.328 --> 56:17.417
but we have a lot to offer.

56:17.461 --> 56:19.288
- I'm sure it does.

56:20.159 --> 56:20.986
- Yah.

56:21.856 --> 56:23.075
Here is your key.

56:24.990 --> 56:26.992
And let me show you
to your room.

56:31.475 --> 56:32.301
This way.

56:33.346 --> 56:34.173
This way.

56:36.349 --> 56:39.352
[traffic commotion]

56:43.051 --> 56:44.531
- [Guy] Thank you.

56:56.413 --> 56:57.588
Okay, I'm bored.

56:57.631 --> 56:59.111
- You're always bored.

56:59.154 --> 57:01.940
- Come on, we're not gonna
stay in here all day, are we?

57:03.071 --> 57:04.333
- What else are we
supposed to do?

57:04.377 --> 57:06.379
This town's a speak on the map.

57:06.423 --> 57:07.206
- So?

57:07.249 --> 57:08.076
Let's check it out.

57:08.120 --> 57:09.338
Get into some trouble.

57:09.382 --> 57:10.905
Have an adventure.

57:10.949 --> 57:11.776
Come on!

57:12.907 --> 57:13.734
- [Girl] Hey!

57:16.433 --> 57:17.608
What the hell, man?!

57:17.651 --> 57:19.523
- I'm sick and tired of
you texting Devon!

57:19.566 --> 57:21.220
We're supposed to be
single on this trip.

57:21.263 --> 57:24.876
- Oh, I'm sorry I broke a
pact we made two years ago.

57:24.919 --> 57:26.138
- That's not the point.

57:26.181 --> 57:28.314
We're supposed to be
living the dream.

57:28.357 --> 57:29.881
Backpacking through
Europe with each other.

57:29.924 --> 57:30.795
- Who's dream?

57:30.838 --> 57:31.665
'Cause I'm pretty sure yours

57:31.709 --> 57:33.667
is just "Europe Trip" on repeat.

57:33.711 --> 57:35.408
- [Guy] Come on, guys.

57:35.452 --> 57:38.106
- Listen, Sam and I have
been living the dream.

57:38.150 --> 57:41.240
We've checked out ruins,
castles, museums,

57:41.283 --> 57:43.808
festivals, hell, we've
even tasted wine in Tuscany

57:43.851 --> 57:44.678
and beer in Munich.

57:44.722 --> 57:45.810
What more do you want?

57:47.507 --> 57:49.161
- I just want to bang whatever
story I can tell people

57:49.204 --> 57:50.205
when I get back.

57:50.249 --> 57:52.556
Nobody gives a shit
about castles.

57:52.599 --> 57:54.471
- No, you don't give a
shit about castles!

57:54.514 --> 57:56.560
- And you don't give shit
about anyone other than Devon!

57:56.603 --> 57:58.518
- You've really got a
problem with him, don't you?

57:58.562 --> 58:00.215
- No, mu problem is with you!

58:00.259 --> 58:01.565
- All right, that's enough!

58:03.044 --> 58:03.871
Jeez.

58:05.177 --> 58:06.178
Let's get out of this place.

58:07.484 --> 58:09.486
Sitting in a hotel isn't
gonna be any more fun

58:09.529 --> 58:11.357
than checking out
what's around here.

58:13.490 --> 58:14.578
Okay?

58:14.621 --> 58:15.840
Come on.

58:15.883 --> 58:17.145
- Fuck.

58:17.189 --> 58:18.582
- You owe me a new phone.

58:18.625 --> 58:20.061
- Fuck you!

58:20.105 --> 58:22.760
[ominous music]

58:43.998 --> 58:46.697
[glass clinking]

58:49.656 --> 58:51.745
- It's in very bad
taste to touch

58:51.789 --> 58:54.095
another person's room set.

58:54.139 --> 58:57.403
That is why it's behind glass.

58:57.446 --> 59:01.102
For you to see and not touch.

59:01.146 --> 59:01.973
- I didn't know.

59:03.235 --> 59:04.845
- It's all right.

59:04.889 --> 59:08.501
They're out for people to be
curious and ask questions.

59:10.459 --> 59:12.374
Now, what can I help you with?

59:12.418 --> 59:14.768
- Pub you were telling us
about earlier.

59:14.812 --> 59:16.117
Is it open yet?

59:16.161 --> 59:17.336
- Yes.

59:17.379 --> 59:18.772
[laughing]

59:18.816 --> 59:19.686
Okie dokie.

59:21.949 --> 59:22.907
Let's go!

59:24.648 --> 59:25.779
This way.

59:25.823 --> 59:26.650
This way.

59:28.129 --> 59:30.697
[upbeat music]

59:34.048 --> 59:34.875
Come, sit.

59:36.137 --> 59:37.574
I will get you a round of ale.

59:43.797 --> 59:45.233
- This is pretty shit.

59:47.322 --> 59:48.280
- Hey.

59:48.323 --> 59:49.411
Hey, are you American?

59:50.630 --> 59:52.023
- Mind if we sit with you guys?

59:52.066 --> 59:55.243
Your English is way
better than these people.

59:55.287 --> 59:56.854
- Come take a seat.

01:00:03.382 --> 01:00:04.209
- So,

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:07.952
what brings you to
the Netherlands?

01:00:07.995 --> 01:00:08.866
- The dream.

01:00:08.909 --> 01:00:09.693
- Graduation.

01:00:10.781 --> 01:00:11.608
- Oh.
- Oh.

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:14.436
- From what, like college?

01:00:15.437 --> 01:00:16.525
What program?

01:00:16.569 --> 01:00:17.918
- Electrical engineering.

01:00:17.962 --> 01:00:19.572
All three of us, actually.

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:21.095
- We're in the same class.

01:00:21.139 --> 01:00:22.793
- [American Man] Oh,
congratulations.

01:00:22.836 --> 01:00:24.229
- [Jason] Thanks.

01:00:27.145 --> 01:00:29.451
- Just the man I wanted to see.

01:00:29.495 --> 01:00:31.628
- I see you have met the Hills.

01:00:33.194 --> 01:00:35.632
This is, don't tell me.

01:00:38.547 --> 01:00:39.374
Sam.

01:00:42.943 --> 01:00:43.944
Jason.

01:00:46.817 --> 01:00:47.600
And Texas.

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:48.645
Uuuh...

01:00:48.688 --> 01:00:49.733
Austin.

01:00:49.776 --> 01:00:50.995
- Hey.

01:00:51.038 --> 01:00:53.301
[clapping]

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:00.787
- Oh.

01:01:02.789 --> 01:01:04.051
I have something.

01:01:05.836 --> 01:01:09.056
I heard a strange
ringing outside

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:11.189
and found this.

01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:13.931
- [Sam] Thank you.

01:01:13.974 --> 01:01:16.585
- I don't know who "Baby cakes"
is

01:01:16.629 --> 01:01:19.110
but I fear he is
dying without you.

01:01:19.153 --> 01:01:20.328
- Baby Cakes?

01:01:20.372 --> 01:01:21.547
Baby Cakes, seriously?

01:01:22.896 --> 01:01:25.116
What the fuck's he call
you, "Snuggle Sammy?"

01:01:25.812 --> 01:01:26.900
- Hey!

01:01:26.944 --> 01:01:28.336
- You're not man enough
to drink this.

01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:30.251
- I don't need to be man enough.

01:01:30.295 --> 01:01:31.165
- Give it back.

01:01:31.209 --> 01:01:32.427
- This is viking brew.

01:01:32.471 --> 01:01:34.342
How dare you insult
their ancestors.

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:36.823
- Oh, Viking.

01:01:36.867 --> 01:01:37.694
Whoa.

01:01:37.737 --> 01:01:38.912
That sounds, like,

01:01:40.914 --> 01:01:42.133
so romantic.

01:01:42.176 --> 01:01:43.482
- [Austin] What?

01:01:43.525 --> 01:01:45.397
- Yeah, Sigurd was telling
us some old legends

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.312
before you guys got here.

01:01:47.355 --> 01:01:48.182
- Like what?

01:01:49.575 --> 01:01:50.837
- Oh,

01:01:50.881 --> 01:01:52.970
tales of viking raids

01:01:54.188 --> 01:01:56.147
and young love stories.

01:01:56.190 --> 01:01:56.974
- Love stories.

01:01:57.017 --> 01:01:58.932
I get enough love from her.

01:01:58.976 --> 01:02:00.412
Hey, Sig, why don't you
tell us something

01:02:00.455 --> 01:02:01.108
a little more interesting?

01:02:02.631 --> 01:02:05.722
- And what would be more
interesting to you, Mr. Briggs?

01:02:05.765 --> 01:02:07.375
- Something scary.

01:02:07.419 --> 01:02:08.986
Something violent.

01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:12.032
Do you have any cool viking
ghosts laying around town?

01:02:12.076 --> 01:02:13.512
- No.

01:02:13.555 --> 01:02:16.384
Our ancestors feast in Valhalla.

01:02:17.298 --> 01:02:18.125
But...

01:02:19.387 --> 01:02:21.520
there is a rule in town.

01:02:21.563 --> 01:02:25.480
We do not enter the
[foreign word] after dark.

01:02:25.524 --> 01:02:26.351
- [Austin] Why?

01:02:27.744 --> 01:02:31.269
- If you do, you'll
never return.

01:02:31.312 --> 01:02:32.139
- But why?

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:35.186
- There are rumors,

01:02:36.491 --> 01:02:38.363
some say they are dark dwarves.

01:02:39.712 --> 01:02:43.237
Others say they are the
children of Baba Yaga,

01:02:43.281 --> 01:02:46.414
or the doctors of the
Goddess Hel.

01:02:48.112 --> 01:02:49.504
But everyone agrees,

01:02:50.592 --> 01:02:53.421
something lives in that forest.

01:02:55.032 --> 01:02:57.251
And it is out to kill.

01:02:59.166 --> 01:03:01.125
- What do you think it is?

01:03:01.168 --> 01:03:02.387
- Lorelei.

01:03:03.344 --> 01:03:04.737
- What's that?

01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:07.566
- Their name means
"murmuring rock."

01:03:09.176 --> 01:03:10.438
Beautiful women

01:03:11.657 --> 01:03:15.139
who sing with even more
beautiful voices.

01:03:16.531 --> 01:03:17.706
They live in the river

01:03:18.882 --> 01:03:22.537
and the lure those who
enter the forest

01:03:22.581 --> 01:03:25.279
to their watery grave.

01:03:25.323 --> 01:03:27.020
- Drown people?

01:03:27.064 --> 01:03:27.847
Why?

01:03:29.457 --> 01:03:30.719
- Why do birds sing?

01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:33.461
Or snakes bite?

01:03:35.289 --> 01:03:36.943
It is in their nature.

01:03:36.987 --> 01:03:38.858
- So you really believe

01:03:38.902 --> 01:03:41.121
that there are evil women
in the forest right now

01:03:41.165 --> 01:03:42.340
waiting to kill someone?

01:03:44.255 --> 01:03:48.302
- Why do you think we are
now here at this time?

01:03:49.695 --> 01:03:52.263
There is strength in numbers.

01:04:01.707 --> 01:04:03.230
- [Austin] Get up, get up,
get up.

01:04:03.274 --> 01:04:04.579
- What the hell, man?

01:04:04.623 --> 01:04:05.450
[shushing]

01:04:05.493 --> 01:04:06.494
- Get dressed, we're going.

01:04:06.538 --> 01:04:07.800
- [Jason] What?

01:04:10.237 --> 01:04:11.282
[Sam groaning]

01:04:11.325 --> 01:04:12.674
- I'm going to check
out the forest.

01:04:12.718 --> 01:04:14.328
Guys, we're going to the forest.

01:04:15.286 --> 01:04:16.635
- [Sam] No.
[Jason groaning]

01:04:16.678 --> 01:04:18.724
- Guys, come on, this is it.

01:04:18.767 --> 01:04:20.421
This is my story.

01:04:20.465 --> 01:04:21.901
If you go right now, I promise

01:04:21.945 --> 01:04:24.295
I will not ask for another
adventure this whole trip.

01:04:24.338 --> 01:04:26.732
[groaning]

01:04:26.775 --> 01:04:28.908
And I'll tell you how
I landed Eric Spinner.

01:04:32.085 --> 01:04:32.869
Oh yeah.

01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:36.611
[laughing]

01:04:36.655 --> 01:04:38.962
[owls hooting]

01:04:39.005 --> 01:04:40.746
- [Sam] How far do we
have to walk?

01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:41.573
- [Austin] Far enough
until I can prove

01:04:41.616 --> 01:04:43.227
that the Loreleis are real.

01:04:45.794 --> 01:04:47.579
- [Sam] Five minutes
feels like 20.

01:04:53.411 --> 01:04:55.282
Are you kidding me?

01:04:55.326 --> 01:04:56.980
It's almost 3:30 already.

01:04:57.937 --> 01:05:01.027
- Weird, that's not the time.

01:05:01.071 --> 01:05:03.029
We've been walking for
fifteen minutes already.

01:05:03.073 --> 01:05:05.336
- Oh great, so numb
nits did break my phone.

01:05:05.379 --> 01:05:06.598
Wonderful!

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:08.774
- [Austin] Hello?

01:05:09.731 --> 01:05:10.558
Shit.

01:05:12.256 --> 01:05:13.561
[screaming]

01:05:13.605 --> 01:05:16.303
- It's okay, we're not
gonna hurt you.

01:05:16.347 --> 01:05:18.349
I mean it, we're not
gonna hurt you.

01:05:19.219 --> 01:05:20.307
Are you okay?

01:05:20.351 --> 01:05:22.309
- I thought you were
one of them.

01:05:23.484 --> 01:05:24.921
- One of who?

01:05:24.964 --> 01:05:26.661
- [Girl] The evil that
lingers in [foreign word].

01:05:28.011 --> 01:05:29.403
- You mean the Lorelei?

01:05:29.447 --> 01:05:30.274
You saw them?

01:05:31.231 --> 01:05:32.232
- I heard them.

01:05:32.276 --> 01:05:33.190
I heard something.

01:05:35.366 --> 01:05:36.889
It's true!

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:38.021
I don't know what the
hell they were

01:05:38.064 --> 01:05:39.805
but they were chasing me.

01:05:39.848 --> 01:05:41.676
- Then where are they?

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:43.722
- [Girl] They must've stopped
when I got on the path.

01:05:43.765 --> 01:05:45.680
- Maybe you should just
stick with us then.

01:05:46.855 --> 01:05:48.945
We could all head back to
town together.

01:05:48.988 --> 01:05:50.033
- Back to town?

01:05:50.076 --> 01:05:50.511
- Yes.

01:05:51.991 --> 01:05:54.515
Evil thing or not, this
girl's scared and it's late.

01:05:54.559 --> 01:05:56.213
We should all turn back.

01:05:56.256 --> 01:05:57.562
Besides, you got your story.

01:05:57.605 --> 01:05:58.867
- The fuck I did!

01:05:58.911 --> 01:06:01.000
- You found a beautiful
woman in the woods.

01:06:01.044 --> 01:06:01.479
What more do you want?

01:06:01.522 --> 01:06:02.697
- Fuck that!

01:06:02.741 --> 01:06:04.351
You found a beautiful
woman in the woods.

01:06:04.395 --> 01:06:06.353
I'm going to get my
fucking story.

01:06:06.397 --> 01:06:07.572
- Come on!

01:06:07.615 --> 01:06:08.965
Austin, stop!

01:06:11.445 --> 01:06:12.272
Fuck!

01:06:13.882 --> 01:06:15.972
I can't leave him to
just walk around alone.

01:06:17.408 --> 01:06:21.455
Listen, it really is safer
if you stick with us.

01:06:21.499 --> 01:06:21.978
I swear.

01:06:23.414 --> 01:06:25.372
We'll head up the trail
with him until he's happy

01:06:25.416 --> 01:06:26.634
and we'll head back home.

01:06:28.158 --> 01:06:29.420
You'll be safe with us.

01:06:29.463 --> 01:06:32.075
- Fine but we need to
stay on the path.

01:06:32.118 --> 01:06:33.337
- We'll stay on the path.

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:36.427
Come on.

01:06:41.127 --> 01:06:43.608
[eerie music]

01:06:46.611 --> 01:06:48.874
[mumbling]

01:06:52.095 --> 01:06:53.879
- [Sam] This is bullshit,
I'm going back!

01:06:53.922 --> 01:06:54.793
- [Jason] What?!

01:06:54.836 --> 01:06:57.622
- We've been at this for hours!

01:06:57.665 --> 01:06:58.884
Whatever Austin's looking for,

01:06:58.927 --> 01:07:00.625
he's not gonna find it
in the fucking woods.

01:07:00.668 --> 01:07:01.452
- [Jason] Sam.

01:07:01.495 --> 01:07:02.583
- No, I'm going!

01:07:03.802 --> 01:07:04.542
- [Jason] Wait.

01:07:04.585 --> 01:07:05.804
Just let me--

01:07:05.847 --> 01:07:07.197
- I'll be fine.

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:09.329
I'll take the path back.

01:07:09.373 --> 01:07:12.376
Really, it's not like there's
any actual monsters in here.

01:07:12.419 --> 01:07:15.379
- Just go catch up with Austin

01:07:15.422 --> 01:07:17.903
and I'll be there in a second.

01:07:17.946 --> 01:07:20.123
[ominous music]

01:07:20.166 --> 01:07:22.516
There might not be any monsters
but there's still animals.

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:23.604
- Have we seen any?

01:07:24.953 --> 01:07:26.129
Exactly!

01:07:26.172 --> 01:07:27.478
I'll be fine.

01:07:27.521 --> 01:07:30.046
So you go hit on your
new girlfriend

01:07:30.089 --> 01:07:32.091
and I'll go talk to
my boyfriend.

01:07:33.092 --> 01:07:34.311
- Fine, fine.

01:07:34.354 --> 01:07:37.140
Then I'll catch you when
we get back then.

01:07:37.183 --> 01:07:38.271
- Yeah, so like noon, right?

01:07:38.315 --> 01:07:40.056
- Yeah, yeah.
[giggling]

01:07:40.099 --> 01:07:40.882
- See you then.

01:07:40.926 --> 01:07:41.753
- Cool.

01:07:44.625 --> 01:07:45.409
- See ya.

01:07:45.452 --> 01:07:46.279
- See ya.

01:07:48.107 --> 01:07:50.762
[ominous music]

01:07:58.204 --> 01:07:59.031
- Jason?

01:08:01.033 --> 01:08:01.860
Austin?

01:08:03.949 --> 01:08:06.169
Austin, I swear to God if
you're trying to scare me

01:08:06.212 --> 01:08:08.040
I'm gonna break your legs!

01:08:08.084 --> 01:08:08.910
- [Whisper] Sam.

01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:11.217
- Who?

01:08:12.784 --> 01:08:15.308
[somber music]

01:08:21.966 --> 01:08:24.622
[water flowing]

01:08:29.408 --> 01:08:30.279
Jesus.

01:08:32.499 --> 01:08:33.457
You scared me.

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:36.416
I was just following...

01:08:39.636 --> 01:08:41.073
Wait!

01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:42.118
Where are you going?

01:08:47.645 --> 01:08:50.126
[eerie music]

01:09:12.496 --> 01:09:13.845
I shouldn't be doing this.

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:18.979
[eerie music]

01:09:48.488 --> 01:09:50.837

[crickets chirping]

01:10:34.491 --> 01:10:36.580
- So how do you know
these two anyway?

01:10:36.623 --> 01:10:40.018
- Well, Austin I've known
since my first year at MUS.

01:10:40.061 --> 01:10:42.238
Sam, I met in our final year.

01:10:44.849 --> 01:10:46.894
I'm Jason, by the way.

01:10:46.938 --> 01:10:48.287
I didn't get your name.

01:10:48.331 --> 01:10:49.549
- Halldora.

01:10:49.593 --> 01:10:50.724
- Halldora.

01:10:50.768 --> 01:10:51.986
Whoa, that's an interesting name

01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:53.640
for someone without an accent.

01:10:53.684 --> 01:10:55.381
- My family's from
the Netherlands.

01:10:55.425 --> 01:10:56.252
- And you're not?

01:10:59.777 --> 01:11:02.127
- [Halldora] What is he
looking at anyway?

01:11:02.170 --> 01:11:04.085
[sighing]

01:11:04.129 --> 01:11:05.826
- Sam and I have had
great years.

01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:08.046
I mean, phenomenal years.

01:11:08.089 --> 01:11:11.049
Both of us top of our
classes, great catches,

01:11:11.092 --> 01:11:13.051
job offers before graduation.

01:11:14.008 --> 01:11:14.835
Austin?

01:11:16.054 --> 01:11:17.273
- Not so much?

01:11:17.316 --> 01:11:18.970
- Yeah.

01:11:19.013 --> 01:11:22.365
I think he's hoping to find
his glory here in Europe

01:11:23.366 --> 01:11:24.149
and just didn't live up--

01:11:24.192 --> 01:11:25.498
- [Austin] Sam?!

01:11:25.542 --> 01:11:26.325
What the fuck?!

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:33.245
- Sam?!

01:11:33.289 --> 01:11:34.115
Sam!

01:11:34.159 --> 01:11:34.551
- [Halldora] No, it's a trap!

01:11:34.594 --> 01:11:35.856
- What?

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:37.771
- The Lorelei, they're
luring us off the path.

01:11:37.815 --> 01:11:38.816
- That's ridiculous.

01:11:38.859 --> 01:11:39.947
- Think about it.

01:11:39.991 --> 01:11:42.123
Your friend went back
towards town.

01:11:42.167 --> 01:11:43.951
How do you think her
phone got here?

01:11:45.126 --> 01:11:47.303
[ominous music]

01:11:47.346 --> 01:11:48.565
- Sam?!

01:11:48.608 --> 01:11:49.609
Sam?!

01:11:49.653 --> 01:11:51.568
- Stop yelling, they
might hear us.

01:11:52.525 --> 01:11:53.744
We need to split up.

01:11:53.787 --> 01:11:55.311
Jason and I are gonna
head back towards town

01:11:55.354 --> 01:11:56.964
to see if she's still
on the path.

01:11:57.008 --> 01:11:59.053
You go forward and see
if she's messing with us.

01:11:59.097 --> 01:12:00.707
- Yes sir, El Capitan!

01:12:03.406 --> 01:12:04.537
- You think that was
a good idea?

01:12:04.581 --> 01:12:07.453
- No but it was the
only idea I had.

01:12:07.497 --> 01:12:09.629

01:12:52.542 --> 01:12:53.717

01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:54.587
Oh yeah.

01:13:42.505 --> 01:13:43.331
- Sam?

01:13:45.812 --> 01:13:46.639
Sam?!

01:13:49.729 --> 01:13:50.556
Sam?!

01:13:52.732 --> 01:13:53.516
Fuck.

01:13:55.082 --> 01:13:55.909
Sam!

01:13:58.608 --> 01:13:59.435
Sam!

01:14:01.349 --> 01:14:02.176
Halldora?

01:14:04.091 --> 01:14:04.918
Halldora!

01:14:08.095 --> 01:14:09.270
Fuck, Halldora.

01:14:10.358 --> 01:14:13.753
Halldora, what the
hell you doing?

01:14:13.797 --> 01:14:15.451
We have to get back.

01:14:17.627 --> 01:14:18.410
What?

01:14:20.586 --> 01:14:21.892
- I warned you...

01:14:23.415 --> 01:14:24.460
of the evil.

01:14:28.638 --> 01:14:31.205

01:14:54.881 --> 01:14:57.493
[water flowing]

01:15:03.107 --> 01:15:04.935
Forget your friends.

01:15:04.978 --> 01:15:06.327
Will you stay with me?

01:15:07.415 --> 01:15:09.113
- Whatever.

01:15:09.156 --> 01:15:11.507

[eerie music]

01:15:41.058 --> 01:15:43.364
- [Sigurd] Did you enjoy
your sacrifices?

01:15:43.408 --> 01:15:46.542
- Yes, we always do
under your care, Sigurd.

01:15:46.585 --> 01:15:48.892
Inga and Katla are very happy.

01:15:48.935 --> 01:15:51.155
They'd like to give you
another gift.

01:15:51.198 --> 01:15:52.896
Perhaps something to go
with your rooms.

01:15:52.939 --> 01:15:54.201
- I need no gift.

01:15:55.333 --> 01:15:57.204
- Not even the
flowers I bring you.

01:15:59.206 --> 01:16:02.601
- Only because they remind
me of you, my darling.

01:16:04.081 --> 01:16:05.996
- The sun is coming.

01:16:06.039 --> 01:16:10.522
- I will have another sacrifice
for you tomorrow night,

01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:12.350
another set of Americans.

01:16:12.393 --> 01:16:13.569
- Go then.

01:16:13.612 --> 01:16:15.527
The more we eat, the
more I get to see you.

01:16:16.789 --> 01:16:20.271
- Of course, anything for you,
my darling.

01:16:24.710 --> 01:16:27.452

[fire crackling]

01:16:44.425 --> 01:16:46.906
- Well, I'm gonna go get
us some more firewood.

01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:47.733
- All right.

01:16:47.777 --> 01:16:49.517
- Michael, wanna join me?

01:16:49.561 --> 01:16:50.562
- [Michael] What?

01:16:50.606 --> 01:16:51.911
- Michael!

01:16:51.955 --> 01:16:53.217
- No!
- Oh yeah.

01:16:54.087 --> 01:16:55.045
Yeah.

01:16:55.088 --> 01:16:56.960
All right, guys, see ya.

01:16:57.003 --> 01:16:58.439
- [Jody] We'll be right back.

01:17:02.792 --> 01:17:05.229
- Do you wanna read one
more before they get back?

01:17:06.186 --> 01:17:07.318
- Yeah, you can.

01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:09.407
- Okay.

01:17:12.453 --> 01:17:13.803
This one's called "Summer Camp."

01:17:13.846 --> 01:17:15.195
- Nope, no, no.

01:17:15.239 --> 01:17:17.458
No, pick another one.
- Oh, come on, it's perfect.

01:17:17.502 --> 01:17:18.721
Just listen.

01:17:18.764 --> 01:17:22.638

01:17:48.968 --> 01:17:50.578
That was Jody!

01:17:50.622 --> 01:17:51.754
- [Frank] What do you
think happened to her?

01:17:51.797 --> 01:17:52.842
- [Natalie] Oh my God!

01:17:53.973 --> 01:17:56.933
[crickets chirping]

01:17:59.718 --> 01:18:01.154
- [Frank] Oh, fuck,
where is she?

01:18:01.198 --> 01:18:02.025
- [Natalie] Jody!

01:18:02.068 --> 01:18:02.852
- [Frank] Jody!

01:18:02.895 --> 01:18:03.679
- [Natalie] Mike!

01:18:03.722 --> 01:18:04.549
- [Frank] Mike!

01:18:06.856 --> 01:18:08.031
Hold on, Natalie,
she's over here.

01:18:08.074 --> 01:18:09.510
I can hear her.

01:18:09.554 --> 01:18:11.730
[coughing]

01:18:13.776 --> 01:18:15.255
Natalie, holy fuck.

01:18:15.299 --> 01:18:16.822
[gagging]

01:18:16.866 --> 01:18:17.649
Jody!

01:18:17.693 --> 01:18:18.955
- [Natalie] Jody?

01:18:18.998 --> 01:18:19.782
- Oh my God.

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:22.436
Okay, we need to get help.

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:24.656
- [Natalie] Jody, what happened?

01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:26.832
[gasping]

01:18:30.270 --> 01:18:31.750
Frank, what're we gonna do?

01:18:31.794 --> 01:18:33.273
- [Frank] It's okay.

01:18:33.317 --> 01:18:35.232
- [Demonic Voice] It's not okay,
Frank.

01:18:37.016 --> 01:18:39.715
[sinister music]

01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:44.458
- What is this?

01:18:44.502 --> 01:18:45.285
This isn't a game.

01:18:45.329 --> 01:18:46.504
Where is Mike?

01:18:46.547 --> 01:18:50.029
- He's right here, he's
happy to see you.

01:18:50.073 --> 01:18:51.901
[gagging]

01:18:51.944 --> 01:18:52.945
The book was mine.

01:18:52.989 --> 01:18:54.817
You should've let me
hold on to it.

01:18:54.860 --> 01:18:56.775
- Stacey, did you do this?

01:18:56.819 --> 01:18:57.907
- Come on, you've
read the stories.

01:18:57.950 --> 01:18:59.735
You're all having so much fun.

01:18:59.778 --> 01:19:00.692
- This is fucked.

01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:01.954
This is so fucked.

01:19:01.998 --> 01:19:03.913
- Thank you, Frank, for
your eloquence.

01:19:03.956 --> 01:19:05.784
Very perceptive of you.

01:19:05.828 --> 01:19:06.654
- No.

01:19:06.698 --> 01:19:08.047
- It was all just in good fun.

01:19:08.091 --> 01:19:09.396
- No.

01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:12.051
- Well, I didn't realize
it was all in good fun.

01:19:12.095 --> 01:19:13.879
Well, you're good to go then.

01:19:13.923 --> 01:19:15.968
Sorry about your friends
and all the killing.

01:19:16.012 --> 01:19:17.056
- Are you serious?

01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:18.449
- Fuck no, Frank!

01:19:18.492 --> 01:19:21.844
Unfortunately, we're gonna
have to kill you too.

01:19:21.887 --> 01:19:22.714
- Run!

01:19:24.542 --> 01:19:27.284
[sinister music]

01:19:31.810 --> 01:19:32.942
Let's go this way.

01:19:36.032 --> 01:19:36.946
Maybe we lost her.

01:19:38.599 --> 01:19:39.426
You okay?

01:19:41.777 --> 01:19:42.560
- [Frank] Just let us go.

01:19:42.603 --> 01:19:43.517
- [Natalie] Stacey, please.

01:19:43.561 --> 01:19:45.258
- [Frank] Let us go!

01:19:45.302 --> 01:19:46.651
- [Natalie] Please.

01:19:46.694 --> 01:19:51.612
[Natalie screaming]

[dramatic music]

01:20:03.189 --> 01:20:05.278
- [Man] Excuse me, are
you a counselor here?

01:20:05.322 --> 01:20:06.192
- Yeah, I am.

01:20:06.236 --> 01:20:07.715
- Hi, my name's Clint Burrell.

01:20:07.759 --> 01:20:10.196
I'm looking for my son,
Dwayne, have you seen him?

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:11.763
- Dwayne.

01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:12.416
Dwayne.

01:20:13.504 --> 01:20:14.940
- Yeah, he's been
here three weeks.

01:20:14.984 --> 01:20:16.202
You should know him.

01:20:16.246 --> 01:20:18.030
Do you not know all
the kids that are here?

01:20:18.074 --> 01:20:19.640
- I'm sorry, sir, he's
not on this list.

01:20:19.684 --> 01:20:20.772
- What?

01:20:20.816 --> 01:20:22.252
What do you mean he's
not on this list?

01:20:22.295 --> 01:20:24.167
He's been here for three weeks.

01:20:24.210 --> 01:20:26.169
What kind of Mickey Mouse
outfit is this?

01:20:26.212 --> 01:20:27.692
You should have his
name on that list.

01:20:27.735 --> 01:20:30.347
- [Counselor] Sir, it's my
first summertime working here

01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:32.088
and I'm trying to do my best.

01:20:32.131 --> 01:20:34.133
- Excuse me, I'm looking
for my daughter.

01:20:34.177 --> 01:20:34.960
Stacey Smith.

01:20:36.396 --> 01:20:37.789
- Yeah, cabin five.

01:20:37.833 --> 01:20:39.182
- Oh.

01:20:39.225 --> 01:20:41.010
- How can you know where
her daughter is

01:20:41.053 --> 01:20:42.576
but you don't know
where my son is?

01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:45.014
Who else can I speak to who
might know where my son is?

01:20:45.057 --> 01:20:46.189
- [Counselor] Everyone
else is at the camp

01:20:46.232 --> 01:20:47.581
getting the kids
ready right now.

01:20:47.625 --> 01:20:49.105
You can come with me right now.

01:20:49.148 --> 01:20:50.193
- Yes, I'll come with you.

01:20:50.236 --> 01:20:52.151
You show me, I'm not
happy about this.

01:20:52.195 --> 01:20:52.978
[eerie music]

01:20:53.022 --> 01:20:54.066
- It's just awful, isn't it?

01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:56.721
I do hope they find
those poor souls.

01:20:56.764 --> 01:20:59.158
- They can't have
gotten very far.

01:20:59.202 --> 01:21:01.857
The search party's been
out all over the property.

01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:05.251
- I'm just happy our girls
are safe, don't you think?

01:21:05.295 --> 01:21:06.731
- I try not to.

01:21:06.774 --> 01:21:08.820
- [Mr. Smith] I'm gonna have
to find a new summer camp

01:21:08.864 --> 01:21:10.256
for Stacey for next year.

01:21:12.345 --> 01:21:14.347
- [Man] Michael!

01:21:14.391 --> 01:21:16.872
[eerie music]

01:21:19.048 --> 01:21:19.875
Jody!

01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:26.664
- Natalie !

01:21:33.323 --> 01:21:35.412
[ominous music]

01:21:35.455 --> 01:21:36.717
- Seatbelt, eh.

01:21:41.026 --> 01:21:43.420
[engine starting]

01:21:43.463 --> 01:21:44.987
What you got there?

01:21:46.466 --> 01:21:47.250
Stacey?

01:21:47.293 --> 01:21:48.338
- Hmmmm?

01:21:48.381 --> 01:21:50.079
Oh, it's just a book.

01:22:00.132 --> 01:22:02.787

01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:19.151
