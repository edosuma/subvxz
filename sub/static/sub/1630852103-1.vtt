27:38.531 --> 27:40.784
I haven't talked to her.
I saw it on social media.

27:40.867 --> 27:43.495
I liked the post,
but we don't follow each other.

27:43.578 --> 27:45.497
We're not friends,
but I wish her the best,

27:45.580 --> 27:48.833
hope that she's happy,
like, lives her best life.

27:48.917 --> 27:50.085
-That's all I…
-[Amanza] Yeah.

27:50.168 --> 27:53.672
If someone's living their best life,
there's less, like, anger and hate

27:53.755 --> 27:55.507
coming out of them towards others.

27:55.590 --> 27:57.884
-I just feel--
-[Mary] I reached out to her too.

27:57.967 --> 27:59.135
She still attacked me,

27:59.219 --> 28:01.429
and so I have very mixed feelings
right now.

28:01.513 --> 28:04.391
[Mary] Christine and I were friends
for about five years.

28:04.474 --> 28:08.186
We used to be very close,
but I know things have happened,

28:08.812 --> 28:10.730
but I thought we worked through them,

28:10.814 --> 28:14.025
and then I had to find out
about her pregnancy online

28:14.109 --> 28:17.570
like everybody else,
and… I just don't know why.

28:17.654 --> 28:22.242
I want nothing but the most amazing things
for her and her baby,

28:22.325 --> 28:24.828
and I hope she's an incredible mother…

28:25.620 --> 28:27.163
but has it changed her so far?

28:27.247 --> 28:29.541
Maybe we can blame it on hormones.
I don't know.

28:29.624 --> 28:32.210
-What could we blame it on before?
-I don't know.

28:32.293 --> 28:33.670
I'm making up excuses,

28:33.753 --> 28:37.173
but I'm sure she could be a very,
very great mom.

28:37.257 --> 28:40.510
I just think she needs
to focus on her and her baby,

28:40.593 --> 28:43.430
and not on what people
are hearting and liking.

28:43.513 --> 28:45.181
[Amanza] I haven't been burned by her.

28:45.265 --> 28:48.017
I mean, she's talked shit
or whatever, but it was like…

28:48.101 --> 28:49.853
As far as Christine and I,

28:50.520 --> 28:51.855
our relationship goes,

28:51.938 --> 28:54.733
I mean, we had, like,
our little beef, you know,

28:54.816 --> 28:57.277
but… I feel like it was all so petty.

28:57.986 --> 29:02.031
So we put all of our bullshit behind us,
and we're good.

29:02.866 --> 29:05.618
-So because I haven't been in your shoes…
-[Mary] Yeah.

29:05.702 --> 29:06.870
…this is me.

29:06.953 --> 29:09.873
"Amanza, don't walk in the street.
You'll get hit by a bus."

29:09.956 --> 29:12.792
I walk in the street,
I get hit by the bus, then I'm like,

29:12.876 --> 29:14.669
"Oh, I got hit by the bus."

29:14.753 --> 29:18.423
But I have to experience it myself,
so it's the same thing with her.

29:18.506 --> 29:21.676
I'm like, I mean, she's not that bad.

29:21.760 --> 29:25.388
-We're not telling you how to feel.
-We're just talking about how we feel.

[Brett] It could be all three.
No, this is important.

29:48.369 --> 29:50.622
[Jason] This is important.
Since Davina left…

29:51.998 --> 29:53.208
I hired a new agent.

29:54.083 --> 29:57.462
-[Amanza] A boy or girl?
-She's a woman, her name's Vanessa.

29:57.545 --> 30:01.549
And she's coming in today,
so please try to make her feel welcome.

30:01.633 --> 30:04.594
-[Chrishell] Oh, good.
-Is she a blonde with nice cleavage?

30:05.178 --> 30:07.806
No, I met her,
and she was a total sweetheart.

30:07.889 --> 30:11.226
You were telling me
she's done Mexican soap operas.

30:11.309 --> 30:13.228
-Yeah.
-[Chrishell] That is so cool.

30:13.311 --> 30:16.439
So you can only hire new people
that have done soap operas?

30:16.523 --> 30:19.067
-That's what Mary said.
-[Heather] Cute. She's coming in today?

30:19.150 --> 30:20.777
-[Brett] Soon, yeah.
-[Chrishell] Good!

30:20.860 --> 30:23.071
Heather, how did the showing go on Doheny?

30:23.696 --> 30:24.614
Really good.

30:24.697 --> 30:28.034
He definitely loved how modern it was,
and how white and bright it was.

30:28.117 --> 30:31.704
I told him we should do a night showing,
so he can see the view with the lights.

30:31.788 --> 30:34.207
Okay, yeah.
That's what sells that house, is the view.

30:34.290 --> 30:36.125
So I think we should go back, yeah.

30:36.209 --> 30:38.461
Chrishell, you know
your listing on Queens?

30:38.545 --> 30:39.629
[Chrishell] Yeah.

30:40.463 --> 30:42.465
I showed my client. He loves it.

30:43.091 --> 30:44.008
He's gonna write.

30:44.092 --> 30:46.052
[tense music playing]

30:46.970 --> 30:48.930
Awesome. That's great.

30:50.765 --> 30:53.893
Uh, but… Well, but I… Okay.

30:53.977 --> 30:55.311
It's not good?

30:55.395 --> 30:59.023
I guess I didn't tell you,
but I'm putting in an offer on that house.

30:59.107 --> 31:01.192
-No, you didn't.
-[Chrishell] What did they write at?

31:01.276 --> 31:04.320
-[Jason] We're writing it today.
-Shoot. [gasps] Oh, no!

31:04.404 --> 31:06.072
We're writing at 3.5, all cash.

31:06.155 --> 31:08.575
I didn't know you wanted
to buy that house.

31:08.658 --> 31:09.826
I didn't think to tell you.

31:09.909 --> 31:11.911
I was just
gonna brag that I sold the house.

31:11.995 --> 31:15.373
I literally thought
that you were gonna be happy with me.

31:15.456 --> 31:17.417
-[chuckles]
-I know. I wanna sell it.

31:17.500 --> 31:21.588
It's obviously my listing and my client,
so I have to get him the best offer.

31:21.671 --> 31:25.133
An all-cash offer
is extremely hard to compete with

31:25.216 --> 31:27.510
because, you know, it's easy.

31:27.594 --> 31:30.889
You know the sale is gonna go through,
the money's there,

31:30.972 --> 31:33.433
you don't have to worry
about a loan, and you're done.

31:33.516 --> 31:36.477
From a seller's perspective,
why wouldn't you want that?

31:36.561 --> 31:40.231
Chrishell, if my client gets the house,
I promise I'll find you a better house.

Hey. How are you?

-Nice to meet you.

Hi, I'm Maya.

Hi, Maya! I'm Vanessa.

-What did I do with her leash?
-[Jason] Your new home.

32:17.727 --> 32:20.271
-[in Spanish] Very beautiful.
-[Vanessa in Spanish] Oh! Thank you.

32:20.355 --> 32:21.230
[all laughing]

32:21.314 --> 32:24.525
[in English] This is my two words
in Spanish that I learned in my life.

32:24.609 --> 32:26.527
So how long you been in the United States?

32:26.611 --> 32:27.528
Sixteen years now.

32:27.612 --> 32:29.864
[in Spanish] We can speak
Spanish in this office.

32:29.948 --> 32:32.200
-[in English] Yeah, Brett speaks Spanish.
-Nice, Brett!

32:32.283 --> 32:35.453
[in Spanish] I speak a little, yes.
We can practice. I want to learn more.

32:35.536 --> 32:37.538
Okay, perfect. Let's practice.

32:37.622 --> 32:39.123
-[laughs]
-[Brett] Perfecto.

32:39.207 --> 32:41.626
[funky music playing]

32:41.709 --> 32:44.754
-[in English] Hi, guys! How are you?
-[Heather] Wow!

32:44.837 --> 32:47.090
-[Maya] Wow, hi.
-[Amanza] Good to see you, mama.

32:47.173 --> 32:49.550
Can you believe
I'm the one who's pregnant one, not you?

32:49.634 --> 32:50.969
-That's so crazy.
-Damn it!

32:51.052 --> 32:52.720
-Hi!
-How are you?

32:52.804 --> 32:55.264
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you. I'm Christine.

32:55.348 --> 32:57.600
-Vanessa? So nice to meet you!
-Vanessa, yeah.

32:57.684 --> 32:59.644
-Chrishell, how are you?
-Hi. Good to see you.

32:59.727 --> 33:02.939
[Chrishell] I have to say,
I wasn't expecting a hug from Christine.

33:03.022 --> 33:07.944
We haven't exactly been on speaking terms
for a very long time, so…

33:08.861 --> 33:10.863
it was a little awkward, but okay.

33:11.572 --> 33:13.449
[Amanza] You gonna
give birth in six-inch heels?

33:13.533 --> 33:16.285
-She'll have her feet in the stirrups.
-[laughs]

33:16.369 --> 33:19.205
-When is your due date?
-They told me like end of May.

33:19.288 --> 33:22.583
-Oh, wow!
-So it can be any day, really.

33:22.667 --> 33:24.711
[Heather] Are you keeping the Lambo?

33:24.794 --> 33:27.422
-Yeah! The baby's going in the Lambo.
-[Heather] I love it.

33:27.505 --> 33:30.717
So, Vanessa, tell me about you.
What's your experience in real estate?

33:30.800 --> 33:32.635
Well, I'm not very experienced yet.

33:32.719 --> 33:35.013
I have just less than a year
in real estate,

33:35.096 --> 33:37.348
but, yeah, it's been such an amazing ride.

33:37.432 --> 33:40.977
I got very lucky because after one month
of being in real estate,

33:41.060 --> 33:42.311
I got my first listing.

33:42.395 --> 33:44.313
-[Christine] Nice!
-[Vanessa] Yeah. I got lucky.

33:44.397 --> 33:46.774
A lot of people told me
you have to be super patient,

33:46.858 --> 33:49.110
because it can take up to a year or more.

33:49.193 --> 33:50.069
Some people get--

33:50.153 --> 33:52.030
-[Maya] Nine months.
-[Vanessa] Oh, wow.

33:52.113 --> 33:55.158
-Mine was probably seven months. Yeah.
-[Vanessa] Wow.

33:55.241 --> 33:58.494
So I never thought that I would like it
as much as I like acting,

33:58.578 --> 34:00.413
because I'm also an actress.

34:00.496 --> 34:03.166
-[Chrishell] Do you still act?
-[Vanessa] I stopped three years ago.

34:03.249 --> 34:06.544
I finished a TV show
with a network, and then, um…

34:07.420 --> 34:11.382
[voice breaks] And then a tragedy,
um, happened in my family,

34:11.466 --> 34:14.260
which is the reason I didn't wanna cry
on my first day here.

34:14.343 --> 34:15.511
[Maya] What happened?

34:17.805 --> 34:19.432
-So my sister died.
-[Maya] Oh, my gosh.

34:19.515 --> 34:22.894
[Vanessa] She's actually the reason
why I'm doing real estate.

34:23.394 --> 34:26.522
She told me
that I should be a realtor like her,

34:26.606 --> 34:27.940
because she was a realtor.

34:28.441 --> 34:29.567
[inhales sharply]

34:29.650 --> 34:32.862
And I'm dedicating my career to her.

34:32.945 --> 34:34.155
Aw!

34:34.238 --> 34:36.449
She was like,
"Vanessa, you'll be amazing as a realtor."

34:36.532 --> 34:38.242
"You love helping people."

34:38.826 --> 34:41.579
And, um, it's been an amazing journey.

34:41.662 --> 34:43.623
[Maya] What happened to her, Vanessa?

34:43.706 --> 34:46.501
-It was a side effect from a medication.
-[Maya] Shoot!

34:46.584 --> 34:47.668
Oh!

34:47.752 --> 34:49.587
So it was unexpected, and…

34:50.463 --> 34:51.798
you know, like… Oh.

34:53.007 --> 34:54.592
[sobbing] I never got to…

34:56.636 --> 34:57.512
to say goodbye

34:57.595 --> 35:00.973
or to learn anything about the reasons
that she wanted me to be on…

35:03.226 --> 35:06.354
But, obviously, the first three months
were a nightmare for me.

35:06.437 --> 35:07.313
[sniffles]

35:07.396 --> 35:09.941
I couldn't eat. I couldn't sleep.

35:10.024 --> 35:12.151
Aw! You guys are so sweet. [chuckles]

35:12.235 --> 35:14.862
I was like,
"She doesn't want to see me like this."

35:14.946 --> 35:15.947
"I have to do something."

35:16.030 --> 35:17.156
Aw, thank you.

35:17.240 --> 35:20.159
I started my healing process,
and then I got my license.

35:20.243 --> 35:21.994
And I'm sure she's so happy,

35:22.078 --> 35:24.122
and she's guiding me
every step of the way.

35:24.205 --> 35:25.706
She's my angel now.

35:28.209 --> 35:29.919
-We're family here.
-[Chrishell] Sisters.

35:30.002 --> 35:32.004
We're dysfunctional, but we're family.

35:32.088 --> 35:33.589
Okay, good! [laughs]

35:33.673 --> 35:36.384
-We're gonna be your sisters too.
-Thank you. Means a lot.

35:36.467 --> 35:38.094
[Amanza] I love you. You're so sweet.

35:38.177 --> 35:42.390
They just met me minutes ago
and they want to give me love and support,

35:42.473 --> 35:44.350
and I was like, "Wow, this is amazing,"

35:44.433 --> 35:46.561
because normally,
when you work with women,

35:46.644 --> 35:48.646
it would be probably the opposite.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.481
They will not support you.

35:50.565 --> 35:53.067
I was gonna be a bitch to you,
and now I feel horrible.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.570
I can't be a bitch to you!
You're too sweet.

35:55.653 --> 35:56.654
You're too nice.

35:56.737 --> 35:58.865
I have had a lot of experiences in my life

35:58.948 --> 36:01.659
where I've worked with women
that are not supporting,

36:01.742 --> 36:05.746
or just competitive
and they have been very mean to me.

36:05.830 --> 36:08.666
If someone is mean to me
because they're being competitive,

36:08.749 --> 36:11.169
I know how to deal with that. Definitely.

36:11.252 --> 36:12.628
[laughs]

36:12.712 --> 36:15.131
