55:00.460 --> 55:01.258
Come on.

55:01.494 --> 55:02.259
I gotcha.

55:04.397 --> 55:05.396
Come on, Sherman.

55:05.698 --> 55:06.397

55:07.667 --> 55:08.466
Okay.

55:12.238 --> 55:13.304
Okay.

55:13.339 --> 55:14.805
Beth, the whole building's
in danger,

55:14.841 --> 55:16.874
you have to get out
of there now!

55:17.243 --> 55:17.842
Beth!

55:19.912 --> 55:22.113
By my estimation
you have ten minutes.

55:22.615 --> 55:23.347

55:23.382 --> 55:24.782
Do you hear me?!

55:24.817 --> 55:25.583
Jack and Charlie.

55:25.618 --> 55:26.517
How are they?

55:26.552 --> 55:28.652
Water bombers are in
the air as we speak.

55:28.688 --> 55:30.454
Okay, that's good a
good thing, right?

55:30.790 --> 55:32.323
Listen to me, Beth.

55:32.425 --> 55:34.658
There's a lot of aluminum
in the elevator shafts.

55:34.694 --> 55:36.460
Aluminum stores
thermal energy

55:36.496 --> 55:39.230
and water can catalyze
its release as a flashover.

55:39.899 --> 55:40.598
In English.

55:42.201 --> 55:44.435
Imagine a room where every
molecule is a bomb

55:44.470 --> 55:45.669

ignite.

someone, maybe there,

01:11:52.204 --> 01:11:55.472
and they're gonna look at you
in a way that makes you feel--

ten feet tall.

01:12:01.379 --> 01:12:05.849

have a little baby,

in your hands

01:12:16.895 --> 01:12:18.661
