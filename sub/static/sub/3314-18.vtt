WEBVTT

00:05.420 --> 00:07.249
(yodeling)

00:07.250 --> 00:10.579
DO WE REALLY HAVE TO SKI THE
LAST RUN OF THE DAY? I'M TIRED.

00:10.580 --> 00:13.209
WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST, HONEY? WHINING
OUR WAY DOWN THE MOUNTAIN?

00:13.210 --> 00:15.459
COME ON! THE WHOLE POINT OF
THIS SKI TRIP IS TO SKI.

00:15.460 --> 00:18.959
I THOUGHT THE POINT WAS TO WEAR CUTE
WINTER OUTFITS AND DRINK HOT TODDIES.

00:18.960 --> 00:20.789
AND AREN'T WE PUSHING OUR LUCK?

00:20.790 --> 00:23.119
I MEAN, THIS PEAK ISN'T CALLED
"AVALANCHE MOUNTAIN" FOR NOTHING.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.039
IT'S ONLY CALLED
AVALANCHE MOUNTAIN

00:25.040 --> 00:27.039
BECAUSE OF THE FRENCH EXPLORER
WHO FIRST CLIMBED IT:

00:27.040 --> 00:29.999
PIERRE AVALANCHE.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.619
NOW C'MON, THE SOONER WE
GET DOWN THIS MOUNTAIN,

00:31.620 --> 00:33.419
THE SOONER WE CAN START WARMING
OURSELVES BY THE FIRE.

00:33.420 --> 00:35.789
OH, AND DRINKING
THOSE HOT TODDIES.

00:35.790 --> 00:38.079
FINE. BUT ONLY BECAUSE
I LOVE YOU...

00:38.080 --> 00:39.789
AND ALCOHOL.

00:39.790 --> 00:42.169
IN THAT ORDER, RIGHT?

00:42.170 --> 00:43.329
LET'S JUST GO.

00:43.330 --> 00:45.079
ALL RIGHT.

00:45.080 --> 00:47.209
ON THREE. ONE, TWO, THREE.

00:47.210 --> 00:49.880
APRES-SKI!

00:54.380 --> 00:57.119
SEE, HONEY? ISN'T THIS GREAT?

00:57.120 --> 00:59.039
WHAT? I CAN'T HEAR YOU?

00:59.040 --> 01:00.669
WHAT'S THAT NOISE...

01:00.670 --> 01:02.499
WHAT'S WHAT... OH, MY GOD!

01:02.500 --> 01:05.119
(sarcastically) "OH, AVALANCHE
MOUNTAIN, IT'LL BE FUN."

01:05.120 --> 01:06.289
YOU THINK THIS IS MY FAULT?

01:06.290 --> 01:07.499
IT WAS YOUR IDEA!

01:07.500 --> 01:08.709

LENNOX, YOU PROMISED ME ON OUR
SEVENTY-FIFTH ANNIVERSARY

01:35.920 --> 01:37.960
THAT WE COULD TOSS THIS
DISGUSTING OLD COUCH.

01:39.170 --> 01:42.619
ZANDER, I'M NOT THROWING IT AWAY TILL
JOE AND AUNT MEL COME BACK HOME.

01:42.620 --> 01:45.209
THEY WERE LOST IN THAT
AVALANCHE A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.

01:45.210 --> 01:47.459
WE CAN NEVER GIVE UP HOPE!

01:47.460 --> 01:48.919
YOU KNOW WHAT, WE CAN.

01:48.920 --> 01:50.169
THEY'RE FROZEN,

01:50.170 --> 01:53.330
LET IT GO. LET IT GO.

01:55.540 --> 01:57.329
BESIDES, WE HAVE PLENTY OF
THINGS TO REMEMBER THEM BY,

01:57.330 --> 01:59.289
BESIDES THE EMBARRASSING COUCH.

01:59.290 --> 02:00.879
OH, WHO CARES?

02:00.880 --> 02:04.039
NO ONE COMES OVER ANYMORE EXCEPT
FOR THE GIRL SCOUT DRONES.

02:04.040 --> 02:09.079
YEAH, BUT THE MINISTRY OF
INFORMATION CAMERAS...

02:09.080 --> 02:11.999
THEY CAN SEE US ALL THE TIME.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.959
OH, PLEASE.

02:13.960 --> 02:14.999
NO ONE'S PAYING ATTENTION

02:15.000 --> 02:17.079
TO A COUPLE OF 120-YEAR-OLDS.

02:17.080 --> 02:19.379
YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW,

02:19.380 --> 02:21.209
WE COULD GIVE THEM ALL
SOMETHING TO WATCH,

02:21.210 --> 02:23.169
'CAUSE I JUST REFILLED MY...

02:23.170 --> 02:24.920
- (rattles)
- MY YOU-KNOW-WHAT PILLS.

02:27.880 --> 02:30.709
OOH! READY.

02:30.710 --> 02:33.579
Computer: You have an
unknown guest at the door.

02:33.580 --> 02:35.289
OH, WHO COULD THAT BE?

02:35.290 --> 02:36.669
SOMEONE WITH GREAT TIMING.

02:36.670 --> 02:37.749
YES?

02:37.750 --> 02:39.419
HOWDY THERE, FOLKS.

02:39.420 --> 02:42.749
I ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE THE
INSIDE OF THIS OLD PLACE.

02:42.750 --> 02:43.789
CAN WE HELP YOU?

02:43.790 --> 02:45.709
I WAS JUST CLIMBING UP
AVALANCHE MOUNTAIN,

02:45.710 --> 02:48.000
AND I BELIEVE I FOUND SOMETHING
THAT BELONGS TO YOU.

02:49.620 --> 02:51.789
(gasps) JOE'S WALLET!

02:51.790 --> 02:53.879
YUP. AND THERE'S ALSO THIS.

02:53.880 --> 02:56.040
(whooshes)

03:00.210 --> 03:02.329
(gasps)

03:02.330 --> 03:03.709
AUNT MEL AND JOE!

03:03.710 --> 03:05.330
OH, I KNEW THEY'D COME BACK!

03:06.920 --> 03:09.879
YAY! NOW WE CAN GET
RID OF THE COUCH!

03:09.880 --> 03:11.249
OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH!

03:11.250 --> 03:12.709
HERE, LET ME GIVE YOU
SOMETHING FOR YOUR TROUBLE.

03:12.710 --> 03:14.209
(chings)

03:14.210 --> 03:19.040
$50,000? THANKS A LOT. I CAN
ALMOST BUY A CUP OF COFFEE.

03:20.120 --> 03:22.460
OH, YOU'RE FINALLY HOME!

03:24.330 --> 03:27.210
(mumbles) UH-OH. I'M STUCK.

03:29.380 --> 03:32.249
I KNOW YOU'RE EXCITED THAT JOE AND
AUNT MEL'S FROZEN BODIES ARE HERE...

03:32.250 --> 03:35.249
AND, WHO WOULDN'T BE?

03:35.250 --> 03:36.709
...BUT WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO WITH THEM?

03:36.710 --> 03:38.789
DEFROST THEM WITH
MY MICROWAVE APP.

03:38.790 --> 03:41.079
OKAY, WAIT! HONEY, YOU
SURE YOU WANT TO ZAP THEM?

03:41.080 --> 03:45.419
BECAUSE YOU MIGHT JUST END UP
WITH SOGGY DEAD RELATIVES.

03:45.420 --> 03:47.709
THEY'RE FROZEN, NOT DEAD.

03:47.710 --> 03:51.210
I'VE HELD OUT HOPE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS.
I'M NOT GIVING UP NOW.

03:54.620 --> 03:56.539
I TOLD YOU WE SHOULDN'T HAVE
DONE THAT LAST SKI RUN!

03:56.540 --> 03:58.330
HEY, WE GOT HOME, DIDN'T WE?

03:59.880 --> 04:01.709
HOW DID WE GET HOME?

04:01.710 --> 04:04.619
AUNT MEL, JOE! YOU'RE ALIVE!

04:04.620 --> 04:07.209
IT'S US... LENNOX AND ZANDER.

04:07.210 --> 04:09.539
WHY DO YOU LOOK LIKE OLD PEOPLE?

04:09.540 --> 04:11.670
BECAUSE WE'RE OLD PEOPLE.

04:13.040 --> 04:16.169
YOU'VE BEEN FROZEN ON AVALANCHE
MOUNTAIN FOR 100 YEARS.

04:16.170 --> 04:17.959
WHAT? (gasps)

04:17.960 --> 04:19.459
- I TOLD YOU!
- OWW!

04:19.460 --> 04:22.619
THE WORLD HAS CHANGED A LOT
SINCE YOU DISAPPEARED.

04:22.620 --> 04:24.289
LIKE, FOR INSTANCE,

04:24.290 --> 04:27.080
NOW, IF YOU WANT A GLASS OF WINE,
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS THIS:

04:29.040 --> 04:31.879
OOH! WATER INTO WINE.
I LOVE THE FUTURE.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.169
YOU EXPECT THAT TO CONVINCE ME?

04:33.170 --> 04:35.249
OKAY. HOW ABOUT THIS?

04:35.250 --> 04:36.420
MULTIPLY.

04:37.420 --> 04:39.579
OOH, I REALLY LOVE THE FUTURE!

04:39.580 --> 04:41.210
OH. YOU SHOULD MAKE SOME
MORE FOR EVERYONE ELSE.

04:42.580 --> 04:44.879
YOU KNOW, IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT
MORE THAN SOME CHEAP MAGIC TRICKS

04:44.880 --> 04:46.709
TO CONVINCE ME THIS IS
ACTUALLY THE FUTURE.

04:46.710 --> 04:48.169
OKAY. IF IT'S NOT,

04:48.170 --> 04:51.459
THEN HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN...

04:51.460 --> 04:53.250
THIS.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.039
OH MY GOD, IT'S TRUE.

04:57.040 --> 05:00.289
AWW, I WANT A ROBOT CAT!

05:00.290 --> 05:02.329
SO, WAIT A MINUTE, WE'VE REALLY
BEEN FROZEN FOR 100 YEARS?

05:02.330 --> 05:04.749
WAIT, THAT MAKES ME 137.

05:04.750 --> 05:06.080
DAMN, I LOOK GOOD!

05:07.120 --> 05:08.249
WHAT ALL DID WE MISS?

05:08.250 --> 05:09.669
OH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

05:09.670 --> 05:11.169
BEFORE YOU TELL US, HOLD ON.

05:11.170 --> 05:14.380
BECAUSE MY BLADDER JUST THAWED,
SO I GOTTA PEE REALLY BAD.

05:16.540 --> 05:21.119
AND BECAUSE SHE ENDED THE SQUIRREL
WARS, PRESIDENT MILEY CYRUS...

05:21.120 --> 05:25.040
WAS ADDED TO THE FACE OF LEXUS
PRESENTS: MOUNT RUSHMORE.

05:26.170 --> 05:27.959
ALWAYS THOUGHT THE ROBOTS
WOULD BE THE ONES TO RISE UP.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.039
NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE THE SQUIRRELS.

05:30.040 --> 05:32.749
THAT'S WHAT THEY
WERE COUNTING ON.

05:32.750 --> 05:34.499
THOSE DAMN SQUIRRELS!

05:34.500 --> 05:37.249
SO, WHERE IS RYDER?

05:37.250 --> 05:39.379
HE MOVED TO THE MOON
ABOUT 50 YEARS AGO.

05:39.380 --> 05:41.079
HE'S IN A COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP

05:41.080 --> 05:42.830
WITH AN ARTIFICIALLY
INTELLIGENT REFRIGERATOR.

05:44.330 --> 05:46.290
SHE ALWAYS KEEPS THINGS FRESH.
(laughs)

05:48.080 --> 05:49.789
WELL, AS LONG AS HE'S
HAPPY, YOU KNOW.

05:49.790 --> 05:51.919
SO, WHAT ABOUT YOU GUYS? WHAT'S
BEEN GOING ON IN YOUR LIVES?

05:51.920 --> 05:55.119
WELL, ZANDER HAS BEEN A WELL-RESPECTED
ARTIST FOR DECADES NOW.

05:55.120 --> 05:57.789
OH, I'M SO GLAD YOU STAYED
SERIOUS ABOUT YOUR ART.

05:57.790 --> 06:00.830
AH, YES. I DESIGN EMOJIS.

06:02.380 --> 06:06.039
I CREATED POOP WITH SUNGLASSES,

06:06.040 --> 06:07.749
POOP WITH MONOCLE,

06:07.750 --> 06:10.499
AND OF COURSE, WEEPING POOP...

06:10.500 --> 06:12.880
FOR WHEN YOU'RE
FEELING REALLY LOW.

06:15.120 --> 06:20.709
WOW. YOU REALLY CARVED OUT
A NICHE WITH THE... POOP.

06:20.710 --> 06:22.209
I SURE DID.

06:22.210 --> 06:24.879
AND, YOU KNOW, LENNOX IS AT THE
TOP OF HER FIELD AS A WRITER.

06:24.880 --> 06:26.249
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
READ HER WORK.

06:26.250 --> 06:27.579
OH, WELL, THAT'S NO SURPRISE.

06:27.580 --> 06:28.879
DID YOU WRITE A
BEST-SELLING NOVEL?

06:28.880 --> 06:30.539
HA! NOVELS.

06:30.540 --> 06:32.209
I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT
WORD IN A LONG TIME.

06:32.210 --> 06:35.379
NO. I WRITE INSPIRATIONAL
SAYINGS FOR THE GOVERNMENT.

06:35.380 --> 06:37.169
IN FACT, MY MOST FAMOUS ONE IS

06:37.170 --> 06:38.919
"DON'T WORRY, BE HAPPY...

06:38.920 --> 06:39.960
"OR ELSE."

06:41.580 --> 06:43.289
THAT SOUNDS KINDA SCARY.

06:43.290 --> 06:45.079
NO, IT'S NOT.

06:45.080 --> 06:48.209
DON'T WORRY, BE HAPPY...
OR ELSE.

06:48.210 --> 06:51.119
WHY WOULD YOU WRITE
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

06:51.120 --> 06:53.379
BECAUSE I WORK FOR
HAPPINESS CONTROL.

06:53.380 --> 06:56.750
THE GOVERNMENT MAKES SURE
EVERYONE IS HAPPY. SEE?

06:58.210 --> 06:59.579
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS, GUYS.

06:59.580 --> 07:02.079
WHAT? NO, LIFE IS
SO MUCH BETTER NOW.

07:02.080 --> 07:03.289
YOU KNOW, AS LONG AS
YOU OBEY THE RULES,

07:03.290 --> 07:05.119
THE GOVERNMENT TAKES
CARE OF EVERYTHING.

07:05.120 --> 07:08.249
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? IF YOU GUYS
HAVE ADJUSTED TO THIS NEW WORLD,

07:08.250 --> 07:09.829
I'M SURE WE'LL BE
HAPPY HERE AS WELL.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.419
DON'T YOU THINK, SWEETIE?

07:11.420 --> 07:13.960
BABE, LONG AS I GOT YOU, THAT'S
REALLY ALL I NEED IN THE WORLD.

07:15.170 --> 07:16.789
(alarm blares)

07:16.790 --> 07:20.039
Computer: Unauthorized affection.
Unauthorized affection.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.459
OH, THAT'S ONE OF THE RULES.

07:21.460 --> 07:23.620
THE GOVERNMENT DECIDES WHO
YOU CAN FALL IN LOVE WITH.

07:25.170 --> 07:28.329
THAT'S RIDICULOUS! COME HERE.

07:28.330 --> 07:30.289
(alarm blares)

07:30.290 --> 07:32.080
Computer: Knock it off...
or else.

07:33.460 --> 07:34.620
I WROTE THAT.

07:38.210 --> 07:41.999
SO, WAIT A MINUTE. I CAN'T KISS MY OWN WIFE
IN MY OWN HOUSE IN THIS CRAZY NEW WORLD?

07:42.000 --> 07:43.289
NOT UNTIL YOU'RE APPROVED.

07:43.290 --> 07:45.499
ANYONE I KISS APPROVES.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.329
NO, JOE. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

07:47.330 --> 07:48.879
TECHNOLOGY HAS
ADVANCED TO THE POINT

07:48.880 --> 07:51.249
WHERE THE GOVERNMENT CAN FIND
YOUR PERFECT MATCH WITHIN HOURS.

07:51.250 --> 07:55.249
WebMD MERGED WITH OkCUPID,
AND, UNEXPECTEDLY, MYSPACE

07:55.250 --> 07:57.619
TO ELIMINATE THE GUESSWORK.

07:57.620 --> 08:01.919
THE MINISTRY OF SEX AND PROCREATION
TESTS EVERYONE FOR COMPATIBILITY,

08:01.920 --> 08:03.619
SO ALL MARRIAGES
ARE PROBLEM-FREE.

08:03.620 --> 08:06.119
OKAY, HOLD ON. HOW DID
YOU TWO END UP TOGETHER?

08:06.120 --> 08:09.579
WELL, WE GOT TESTED AND TURNS
OUT WE'RE A PERFECT MATCH.

08:09.580 --> 08:11.539
REALLY? WITH ALL YOUR
ON-AGAIN, OFF-AGAIN HISTORY?

08:11.540 --> 08:14.119
WELL, WE GOT APPROVED BY THE
DEPARTMENT OF SEX AND PROCREATION,

08:14.120 --> 08:16.460
AND S&P IS NEVER WRONG.

08:17.620 --> 08:20.039
LISTEN GUYS, IF YOU WANT TO
LIVE IN THE MODERN WORLD,

08:20.040 --> 08:22.619
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE THE
GOVERNMENT'S COMPATIBILITY TEST.

08:22.620 --> 08:24.749
OOH, IS IT LIKE ONE OF
THOSE FUN COSMO QUIZZES?

08:24.750 --> 08:28.879
SORT OF, BUT WITH BLOOD,
URINE, AND BONE MARROW.

08:28.880 --> 08:30.960
WOW. WAY TO SELL IT. NO THANKS

08:31.960 --> 08:33.499
BUT, YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE TEST.

08:33.500 --> 08:38.460
IN FACT, MY MOST VIEWED SAYING IS "YOU
HAVE TO TAKE THE TEST. HAPPY FACE."

08:39.830 --> 08:41.249
I DESIGNED THE HAPPY FACE.

08:41.250 --> 08:44.959
WHICH WAS EASY, BECAUSE
LIFE HERE IS SO PERFECT.

08:44.960 --> 08:47.329
WHAT THE HECK HAS
HAPPENED TO YOU GUYS?

08:47.330 --> 08:49.379
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

08:49.380 --> 08:52.669
I THINK HE MEANS ARE YOU GUYS REALLY
FINE WITH ALL OF THESE RESTRICTIVE LAWS?

08:52.670 --> 08:56.499
SEE, HAPPINESS CONTROL PREFERS
TO CALL THEM "NO-NO's,"

08:56.500 --> 08:59.170
AND IF YOU BREAK THEM, YOU SPEND THE
REST OF YOUR LIFE IN THE JOY PIT.

09:01.170 --> 09:03.210
BUT, IT'S NOT SAD, BECAUSE
WE FORGET YOUR NAME.

09:10.420 --> 09:12.289
OH, HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
WATCHING, THERE, HON?

09:12.290 --> 09:15.120
THE SIMPSONS 126TH
SEASON PREMIERE.

09:16.210 --> 09:17.960
GREAT. I WILL JOIN YOU.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.539
(both chuckle)

09:22.540 --> 09:24.579
Both: AWW.

09:24.580 --> 09:26.079
(alarm sounds)

09:26.080 --> 09:27.709
Computer: Unauthorized
affection.

09:27.710 --> 09:30.670
Second floor closet.
Unauthorized affection.

09:31.670 --> 09:33.499
WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING, ALL RIGHT?
WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!

09:33.500 --> 09:35.460
IT WAS ALL UNDER THE
SHIRT, OVER THE BRA.

09:36.670 --> 09:38.459
YOU PROMISED TO
FOLLOW THE RULES.

09:38.460 --> 09:39.789
HEY, GIVE ME A BREAK, ALL RIGHT?

09:39.790 --> 09:42.790
TECHNICALLY, I'M BACKED
UP FOR, LIKE, 100 YEARS.

09:43.830 --> 09:46.619
Computer: An official from the
ministry of sex and procreation

09:46.620 --> 09:50.209
is at the door for Mel
Burke and Joe Longo.

09:50.210 --> 09:51.379
QUICK, HIDE US!

09:51.380 --> 09:54.209
(shouts) THEY'RE IN HERE!

09:54.210 --> 09:55.380
THANKS A LOT, BUDDY.

09:59.250 --> 10:00.919
MEL BURKE AND JOE LONGO,

10:00.920 --> 10:03.000
YOU WERE WARNED EARLIER,
BUT PAID NO ATTENTION.

10:04.250 --> 10:06.289
WHAT IS THAT? A "NO-NO"?

10:06.290 --> 10:08.250
A FEDERAL NO-NO.

10:09.620 --> 10:11.709
IT IS NOW TIME FOR YOU
COMPATIBILITY TESTS.

10:11.710 --> 10:13.879
LET'S BEGIN.

10:13.880 --> 10:16.789
BUT, LOOK, WE'VE BEEN MARRIED A LONG TIME.
CAN'T YOU JUST KIND OF GRANDFATHER US IN?

10:16.790 --> 10:18.249
THAT'S NOT THE WAY
THE RULES WORK.

10:18.250 --> 10:22.249
YOU KNOW WHAT WE SAY: "YOU HAVE
TO TAKE THE TEST. HAPPY FACE."

10:22.250 --> 10:25.709
LOOK, I KNOW MEL AND I ARE PERFECT
FOR EACH OTHER, ALL RIGHT?

10:25.710 --> 10:27.459
AND, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
MAN, BUT I'M SORT OF A FAN

10:27.460 --> 10:30.119
OF KEEPING MY BONE
MARROW IN MY BONES.

10:30.120 --> 10:32.709
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THIS IS, THE 2040s?

10:32.710 --> 10:34.789
WE DON'T TAKE MARROW
SAMPLES ANYMORE.

10:34.790 --> 10:37.419
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS KISS THE OMNI.

10:37.420 --> 10:39.419
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE
KISSED THAT THING?

10:39.420 --> 10:43.079
DON'T WORRY. BETWEEN EACH USE, I WIPE IT
DOWN WITH THE CLEANEST SUBSTANCE ON EARTH.

10:43.080 --> 10:44.539
WHAT'S THE CLEANEST
SUBSTANCE ON EARTH?

10:44.540 --> 10:46.040
- TOE FUNGUS.
- (gagging)

10:48.170 --> 10:49.709
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:49.710 --> 10:51.420
- YOUR TURN. -NO, I'M NOT
PUTTING MY LIPS ON TOE FUNGUS.

10:52.500 --> 10:54.539
NO PROBLEM. I CAN ALWAYS
USE YOUR HEAT SIGNATURE.

10:54.540 --> 10:57.079
- WHAT? WHY DIDN'T I GET THAT CHOICE?
- (hums)

10:57.080 --> 10:59.209
AND NOW WE WAIT FOR THE RESULTS.

10:59.210 --> 11:02.169
UH, LISTEN, WE KNOW THAT WE'RE
HAPPY TOGETHER, SO YOU CAN JUST...

11:02.170 --> 11:04.669
SORRY FOR THE WAIT. SYSTEM'S
A LITTLE SLOW. NO MATCH.

11:04.670 --> 11:06.039
WHAT?

11:06.040 --> 11:07.709
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR
LITTLE DEVICE SAYS, PAL,

11:07.710 --> 11:09.079
MEL AND I ARE PERFECT
FOR EACH OTHER!

11:09.080 --> 11:11.289
THE STATE IS NEVER WRONG.

11:11.290 --> 11:13.379
YOU KNOW WHAT, WE WOULDN'T BE IN THIS MESS
IF YOU HADN'T MADE US DO THAT LAST SKI RUN!

11:13.380 --> 11:15.459
- OH, SO NOW YOU'RE BLAMING ME? -YEAH.
I WANTED TO GO TO TAHITI.

11:15.460 --> 11:17.579
- YOU KNOW WHAT, NEXT TIME,
SEPARATE VACATIONS! -OKAY.

11:17.580 --> 11:20.249
LOOK AT YOU TWO ARGUE. YOU ARE
CLEARLY NOT A COMPATIBLE COUPLE.

11:20.250 --> 11:23.249
OH, NO, WE'RE NOT ARGUING. THIS IS
THIS LITTLE BANTER THING THAT WE DO.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.119
YOU KNOW, IT'S OUR THING.
IT'S CUTE.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.169
IT'S NOT.

11:27.170 --> 11:28.459
BUT WE'RE MARRIED!

11:28.460 --> 11:29.749
NOT ANYMORE.

11:29.750 --> 11:32.960
YOUR NEW MATES WILL ARRIVE
VIA DRONE IN TWO HOURS.

11:34.670 --> 11:37.790
HAVE A NICE DAY. OR ELSE.ú

11:41.210 --> 11:43.120
- (door hums, closes)
- SEEMS LIKE A SWEET GUY.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.709
OWW! WHAT THE...

11:47.710 --> 11:51.539
Computer: Please remain in the
house until your new mate arrives.

11:51.540 --> 11:55.079
I HAVE TRIED EVERY DOOR, AND EVERY WINDOW.
THERE IS NO WAY OUT OF THIS PLACE.

11:55.080 --> 11:57.079
WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO GET OUT OF HERE?

11:57.080 --> 11:59.919
BECAUSE MEL AND I
CAN'T BE TOGETHER!

11:59.920 --> 12:02.079
WHY WOULD I WANT TO LIVE SOMEWHERE
WHERE I HAVE NO FREE WILL?

12:02.080 --> 12:04.289
CAREFUL. YOU SOUND
LIKE THE F.L.R.

12:04.290 --> 12:05.830
THE WHAT?

12:08.080 --> 12:11.579
THE FREE LOVE REBELS.

12:11.580 --> 12:13.329
THEY ESCAPED AND STARTED
THEIR OWN COLONY

12:13.330 --> 12:14.999
WHERE THEY CAN LOVE
WHOEVER THEY WANT,

12:15.000 --> 12:17.249
AND THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T
DECIDE ANYTHING FOR THEM.

12:17.250 --> 12:19.209
IT SOUNDS AWFUL.

12:19.210 --> 12:21.329
WAIT, IS THIS A REAL PLACE?

12:21.330 --> 12:23.039
YEAH. IT'S OUT WEST SOMEWHERE...

12:23.040 --> 12:25.419
IN THE HILLS, BEYOND THE RIVER.

12:25.420 --> 12:28.789
THEY CALL IT...
(whispers) "CALABASAS."

12:28.790 --> 12:31.499
- CALABASAS?
- SHH!

12:31.500 --> 12:34.919
DON'T SAY THE C-WORD OUT LOUD.
S&P REALLY DOESN'T LIKE IT.

12:34.920 --> 12:38.579
Computer: Your perfect mates
have arrived at the door.

12:38.580 --> 12:39.920
(shouts) THEY'RE IN HERE!

12:41.210 --> 12:42.619
WAS THAT REALLY NECESSARY?

12:42.620 --> 12:43.620
I JUST LIKE TO BE HELPFUL.

12:46.170 --> 12:49.879
LOOK, JOE, I PROMISE,
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

12:49.880 --> 12:51.210
IN MY HEART, YOU'RE
THE ONLY ONE FOR ME.

12:54.170 --> 12:58.620
MEL BURKE? I AM... RAMON.

13:01.460 --> 13:03.170
HELLO, HANDSOME.

13:04.170 --> 13:06.169
- WHAT?
- JUST BEING POLITE.

13:06.170 --> 13:09.289
OH, I SEE. SOME SUPER HOT GUY SHOWS UP AND
SUDDENLY YOU FORGET ABOUT YOUR ONE TRUE LOVE.

13:09.290 --> 13:11.040
HEYOO!

13:12.170 --> 13:13.249
HI, JOE. I'M LINDA.

13:13.250 --> 13:14.289
I'M MINDA.

13:14.290 --> 13:16.789
Both: WE'RE YOUR NEW WIFE.

13:16.790 --> 13:20.329
BUT, I DON'T UNDERSTAND? I THOUGHT WE
WERE EACH ASSIGNED JUST ONE PERFECT MATE.

13:20.330 --> 13:22.499
YES. BUT, SINCE WE
HAVE IDENTICAL DNA...

13:22.500 --> 13:25.209
WE'RE BOTH THE PERFECT
MATE FOR YOU.

13:25.210 --> 13:27.080
(emotionally) GOD
BLESS THE FUTURE.

13:29.040 --> 13:30.619
REALLY, JOE?

13:30.620 --> 13:32.289
HONEY, RELAX, ALL RIGHT? I'M JUST
PLAYING IT UP FOR THE CAMERAS.

13:32.290 --> 13:34.080
(mouths)

13:36.830 --> 13:38.879
YOU KNOW, YOU'D THINK AFTER BEING
FROZEN FOR A HUNDRED YEARS

13:38.880 --> 13:40.209
I'D HAVE SOME SERIOUS
MUSCLE ATROPHY,

13:40.210 --> 13:44.119
BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT THESE
GUNS, THEY DON'T RUST.

13:44.120 --> 13:45.169
(giggling)

13:45.170 --> 13:46.619
OH, JOE...

13:46.620 --> 13:48.329
- TELL US MORE ABOUT YOUR
WORKOUT ROUTINE... -WON'T YOU?

13:48.330 --> 13:51.210
UM... OKAY!

13:52.170 --> 13:54.999
THOSE RETRO STILETTOS ARE
SO ELEGANT AND DARING...

13:55.000 --> 13:57.379
JUST LIKE THE WOMAN
WHO WEARS THEM.

13:57.380 --> 13:59.289
OH, YOU.

13:59.290 --> 14:00.879
GO ON.

14:00.880 --> 14:03.169
AND YOUR LEGS ARE SO SMOOTH.

14:03.170 --> 14:06.120
THESE OLD THINGS? I HAVEN'T
SHAVED THEM IN DECADES.

14:09.620 --> 14:12.119
SEE? TOTALLY PERFECT MATCHES.

14:12.120 --> 14:14.829
I KNOW. YOU KNOW, WE THINK
WE KNOW WHAT WE WANT,

14:14.830 --> 14:16.999
BUT THE GOVERNMENT KNOWS BEST.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.169
OOH, I NEED TO WRITE
THAT ONE DOWN.

14:20.170 --> 14:22.209
YOUR VOICE IS LIKE HONEY.

14:22.210 --> 14:24.079
OH, WELL, AREN'T YOU...

14:24.080 --> 14:25.709
SO RIGHT.

14:25.710 --> 14:28.249
HEY, HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:28.250 --> 14:31.119
WHAT? OH, HONEY, I'M JUST TRYING TO GET
THROUGH THIS WHOLE THING THE BEST I CAN.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.459
Computer: Your meetings
with your perfect matches

14:33.460 --> 14:35.209
have reached completion.

14:35.210 --> 14:37.040
RAMON, LADIES, RIGHT THIS WAY.

14:39.960 --> 14:42.500
GETTING TO KNOW YOU HAS
BEEN SO DELIGHTFUL.

14:44.670 --> 14:46.080
LADIES.

14:49.500 --> 14:51.499
(sighs) WELL, WE MADE
IT THROUGH OUR DATES.

14:51.500 --> 14:53.669
NOW AS SOON AS THEY LEAVE WE
CAN FIGURE OUT OUR NEXT MOVE.

14:53.670 --> 14:55.829
MM-HMM. YUP.

14:55.830 --> 14:58.579
OUR NEXT MOVE REGARDING WHAT?

14:58.580 --> 14:59.619
GETTING OUT OF HERE?

14:59.620 --> 15:02.040
RIGHT, YES! RIGHT. OKAY.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.619
IT WAS SO GREAT
MEETING YOU, RAMON...

15:05.620 --> 15:07.040
AND LINDA AND MINDA.

15:09.170 --> 15:11.289
OH, THE NIGHT IS JUST BEGINNING.

15:11.290 --> 15:15.039
Computer: Commence phase
two in one minute.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.709
WHAT'S PHASE TWO?

15:16.710 --> 15:17.749
SEX.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.209
YOU KNOW, DOING IT.

15:19.210 --> 15:20.500
BOONGA-BOONGA.

15:21.540 --> 15:23.419
EXCEPT NOW WE DO IT
IN THE SEX MACHINE.

15:23.420 --> 15:26.249
SEX MACHINE? I DON'T
NEED A SEX MACHINE.

15:26.250 --> 15:27.619
I AM A SEX MACHINE.

15:27.620 --> 15:30.119
NO, THIS THING IS
SUCH AN IMPROVEMENT.

15:30.120 --> 15:32.880
MAKES OLD SEX SEEM LIKE A CHORE.

15:34.210 --> 15:36.789
WE FORGOT TO EXPLAIN. THIS
IS HOW YOU GET MARRIED NOW.

15:36.790 --> 15:39.919
YEAH, YOU JUST STEP INSIDE WITH
YOUR PERFECT MATCH AND CONSUMMATE.

15:39.920 --> 15:41.329
WHAT IF I REFUSE?

15:41.330 --> 15:42.879
WELL, THEN YOU GO
TO THE JOY PIT.

15:42.880 --> 15:44.379
AND TRUST ME, YOU
DO NOT WANT TO KNOW

15:44.380 --> 15:46.250
WHAT THEY MAKE YOU HAVE
SEX WITH IN THERE.

15:47.330 --> 15:49.619
Computer: Mel Burke,
please enter the machine

15:49.620 --> 15:52.539
for perfect sex with
your perfect mate.

15:52.540 --> 15:54.619
SHALL WE, MY DEAR?

15:54.620 --> 15:57.789
BUT, I DON'T WANT TO HAVE PERFECT
SEX WITH MY PERFECT MATE.

15:57.790 --> 15:58.880
I WANT JOE.

16:00.420 --> 16:03.289
I DON'T CARE IF THEY
LOCK US UP, I LOVE YOU.

16:03.290 --> 16:05.039
LET'S SHOW THIS MACHINE
A THING OR TWO.

16:05.040 --> 16:06.710
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
ASK ME TWICE, BABY.

16:08.040 --> 16:09.329
(gasps) HEY, YOU CAN'T...

16:09.330 --> 16:10.830
- DO THAT!
- (both gasp)

16:13.040 --> 16:15.419
(computer growls sexily) Yow!
Look out!

16:15.420 --> 16:17.459
Sex machine engaged.

16:17.460 --> 16:19.539
NO, NO, NO. AUNT MEL, JOE!

16:19.540 --> 16:21.829
NO, THE MACHINE WILL KNOW.
DON'T DO THIS!

16:21.830 --> 16:25.119
Computer: Unauthorized entry.
Unauthorized entry.

16:25.120 --> 16:27.249
WHAT ARE THEY DOING? THE
PLEASURE LEVELS ARE TOO HIGH!

16:27.250 --> 16:29.119
THEY'RE GONNA BREAK THE MACHINE!

16:29.120 --> 16:30.669
Computer: Yow, get on up!

16:30.670 --> 16:33.830
Danger. Danger.
Circuit overload.

16:36.880 --> 16:40.039
UH-OH. I DON'T WANT TO BE
ASSOCIATED WITH REBEL ACTIVITY.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.000
- LET'S GET OUT OF HERE... -BEFORE
HAPPINESS CONTROL ARRIVES!

16:44.540 --> 16:46.420
OMNI, EMERGENCY POWER.

16:53.170 --> 16:55.499
WHOA.

16:55.500 --> 16:57.999
MY WORD EXACTLY.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.289
YEAH, GREAT JOB, GUYS.

16:59.290 --> 17:01.289
YOU SHORTED OUT ALL THE
POWER IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

17:01.290 --> 17:04.879
YOU KNOW, IT COULD BE HOURS TILL THE
CABLE GUY ROBOT SHOWS UP TO FIX THINGS?

17:04.880 --> 17:07.119
WAIT A MINUTE!

17:07.120 --> 17:08.209
IF THE POWER'S OUT...

17:08.210 --> 17:10.499
HONEY, WE JUST DID IT.

17:10.500 --> 17:12.289
NO, NO, NO, HONEY,
DON'T YOU SEE?

17:12.290 --> 17:14.209
THAT MEANS THAT WE'RE
NOT BEING WATCHED!

17:14.210 --> 17:15.829
WHICH MEANS THIS IS
OUR CHANCE TO ESCAPE!

17:15.830 --> 17:18.419
- TO WHERE?
- TO WHERE? HONEY,

17:18.420 --> 17:20.249
TO THE ONE PLACE WHERE OUR
LOVE IS NOT FORBIDDEN,

17:20.250 --> 17:22.880
THE ONE PLACE WHERE
WE CAN TRULY BE FREE!

17:24.250 --> 17:25.289
CALABASAS.

17:25.290 --> 17:27.579
(angelic chorus)

17:27.580 --> 17:28.879
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

17:28.880 --> 17:30.749
- YES!
- COME ON, WE GOTTA GO!

17:30.750 --> 17:32.289
- OH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!
- HONEY, PLEASE,

17:32.290 --> 17:33.669
I'M SURE THEY'RE GONNA
HAVE WINE THERE.

17:33.670 --> 17:37.039
NO! NO, NO, NO, I CAN'T
GO WITHOUT MY FAMILY.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.829
LENNOX, ZANDER, YOU
HAVE TO COME WITH US.

17:39.830 --> 17:42.829
LENNOX AND I HAVE A
PRETTY GOOD SETUP HERE.

17:42.830 --> 17:45.290
MY NEXT EMOJI'S GONNA BE HUGE.
IT'S POOP ON THE BEACH.

17:46.790 --> 17:49.209
AUNT MEL, WE CAN'T
BREAK THE RULES.

17:49.210 --> 17:51.999
LENNOX, HONEY,

17:52.000 --> 17:53.579
YOU USED TO LOVE TO
BREAK THE RULES.

17:53.580 --> 17:56.879
DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU USED
TO WRITE CONTROVERSIAL PLAYS?

17:56.880 --> 17:58.919
AND WHAT ABOUT THAT CASSANDRA
CHARACTER THAT YOU CREATED?

17:58.920 --> 18:00.209
I MEAN, SHE BROKE ALL THE RULES.

18:00.210 --> 18:02.579
YEAH. COME WITH US.

18:02.580 --> 18:04.169
BE WHO YOU REALLY ARE...

18:04.170 --> 18:06.289
IN CALABASAS.

18:06.290 --> 18:07.419
(angelic chorus)

18:07.420 --> 18:10.289
YES! YES, AUNT MEL, I'LL GO,

18:10.290 --> 18:12.329
BUT YOU HAVE TO COME, TOO.

18:12.330 --> 18:14.329
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT,
OKAY, LET'S DO IT.

18:14.330 --> 18:15.619
OKAY.

18:15.620 --> 18:17.289
OKAY, WAIT, WAIT A MINUTE.
JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR,

18:17.290 --> 18:19.209
IF WE'RE GOING TO THE
LAND OF FREE CHOICE,

18:19.210 --> 18:21.039
YOU'LL STILL CHOOSE ME
TO BE YOUR MATE, RIGHT?

18:21.040 --> 18:23.999
ZANDER, HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU?

18:24.000 --> 18:25.669
I LOVE YOU.

18:25.670 --> 18:29.169
BESIDES, I'M 120 YEARS OLD. I
DON'T HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS.

18:29.170 --> 18:31.380
WHEW. OKAY, LET'S GO.

18:35.330 --> 18:36.330
COME ON.

18:37.330 --> 18:40.169
OH, LOOK, THERE IT IS!

18:40.170 --> 18:41.919
WE FOUND CALABASAS!

18:41.920 --> 18:44.379
(angelic chorus)

18:44.380 --> 18:48.209
Man: WHO GOES THERE?
STATE YOUR BUSINESS!

18:48.210 --> 18:52.120
IT'S US. WE WISH TO LIVE
FREELY HERE WITH THE REBELS.

18:53.250 --> 18:54.459
UNCLE JOE?

18:54.460 --> 18:56.749
MARCO!

18:56.750 --> 18:57.789
MARCO?

18:57.790 --> 18:59.540
OH. GREAT.

19:01.170 --> 19:02.459
LENNOX SCANLON?

19:02.460 --> 19:04.709
YOU'RE A SIGHT FOR SORE EYES.

19:04.710 --> 19:07.169
HOW IS IT YOU HAVEN'T
AGED AT ALL?

19:07.170 --> 19:08.959
I GOT THE LONGO BLOOD.

19:08.960 --> 19:11.919
SEE WHAT YOU HAVE
TO LOOK FORWARD TO?

19:11.920 --> 19:15.959
LENNOX, YOU'RE LOOKING
MIGHTY FINE YOURSELF.

19:15.960 --> 19:18.289
LET ME SHOW YOU AROUND
THE VERDANT VALLEY.

19:18.290 --> 19:21.119
WAIT, YOU KNOW WHAT
"VERDANT" MEANS?

19:21.120 --> 19:23.169
IN 100 YEARS YOU
PICK UP SOME THINGS.

19:23.170 --> 19:24.919
I'VE BECOME QUITE LITERATE.

19:24.920 --> 19:27.709
YOU MIGHT EVEN SAY,
"SESQUIPEDALIAN."

19:27.710 --> 19:29.580
OH, MARCO.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.079
HEY, UH, LENNOX? YOU KNOW WE SHOULD
PROBABLY GET BACK TO TOLEDO.

19:34.080 --> 19:36.829
YOU KNOW, HAPPINESS CONTROL IS
JUST GONNA BE LOST WITHOUT YOU.

19:36.830 --> 19:37.879
LENNOX?

19:37.880 --> 19:40.289
OH GOD! LENNOX?

19:40.290 --> 19:41.830
BROUGHT MY YOU-KNOW-WHAT
PILLS FOR NOTHING!

19:44.080 --> 19:46.539
SO, HERE WE ARE, SWEETIE.
TOGETHER FOREVER.

19:46.540 --> 19:47.709
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO LIVE?

19:47.710 --> 19:50.119
HMM, HOW ABOUT RIGHT
THERE BY THE RIVER?

19:50.120 --> 19:52.249
NO, BY THE RIVER? NO,
THAT'S NOT GONNA BE GOOD.

19:52.250 --> 19:54.169
THERE'S GONNA BE FLOODING
AND MOSQUITOES DOWN THERE.

19:54.170 --> 19:55.879
HOW ABOUT THIS, WHY DON'T WE
LIVE UP HERE ON THE HILL,

19:55.880 --> 19:57.419
WHERE WE HAVE A NICE
VIEW OF THE RIVER?

19:57.420 --> 19:59.209
NO, BUT IF WE LIVE
UP ON THE HILL,

19:59.210 --> 20:01.999
THEN WHEN WE WANT WATER, WE NEED TO WALK
MILES AND MILES DOWN THE THE RIVER.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.709
WHEN WE COULD HAVE JUST
WALKED OUT OUR FRONT DOOR,

20:03.710 --> 20:05.249
- SO, WE'LL DIG A WELL.
- NO, YOU'LL DIG A WELL.

20:05.250 --> 20:07.079
- NO, WE'RE GONNA DIG A WELL.
- I DON'T DIG.

20:07.080 --> 20:09.289
- WE ARE GONNA DIG A WELL. -I DON'T DIG.
DO YOU SEE MY NAILS?

20:09.290 --> 20:11.289
DIG YOUR OWN WELL.

20:11.290 --> 20:12.920
I'M GONNA GO LIVE BY
THE RIVER WITH RAMON.

20:14.710 --> 20:15.879
HONEY?

20:15.880 --> 20:17.040
ARE YOU OKAY?

20:18.500 --> 20:19.500
WHAT YEAR IS IT?

20:21.040 --> 20:22.999
THE SAME YEAR YOU WENT
TO SLEEP, SWEETIE.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.669
(sighs)

20:24.670 --> 20:26.169
I JUST HAD THE WORST DREAM.

20:26.170 --> 20:28.879
WE WERE SKIING, THERE
WAS AN AVALANCHE,

20:28.880 --> 20:30.289
THEN WE WERE IN THE FUTURE,

20:30.290 --> 20:33.119
AND WE COULDN'T LOVE
EACH OTHER ANYMORE

20:33.120 --> 20:37.039
OR HAPPINESS CONTROL WOULD
SEND US TO THE JOY PIT.

20:37.040 --> 20:39.000
WHEN DID THIS COUGH
SYRUP EXPIRE?

20:45.120 --> 20:47.169
HEY, AUNT MEL, WE BROUGHT
YOU A BOWL OF CHICKEN SOUP.

20:47.170 --> 20:48.789
WELL, HALF A BOWL.

20:48.790 --> 20:50.539
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

20:50.540 --> 20:52.789
LENNOX, ZANDER...

20:52.790 --> 20:54.999
I HAD THE WEIRDEST DREAM,
AND YOU WERE THERE,

20:55.000 --> 20:57.579
YOU WERE THERE, AND
YOU WERE THERE.

20:57.580 --> 20:59.789
AND I LEARNED THAT CALABASAS

20:59.790 --> 21:02.210
IS RIGHT HERE IN
MY OWN BACK YARD.

21:03.580 --> 21:05.329
I'M GONNA CALL THE DOCTOR. I
THINK SHE'S GETTING WORSE.

21:05.330 --> 21:07.039
NO, NO, NO, NO!

21:07.040 --> 21:09.499
IT'S JUST THAT, YOU KNOW,
THE DREAM FELT SO REAL.

21:09.500 --> 21:12.249
WE WERE IN THIS SCARY FUTURE. AND WE
HAD TO HAVE SEX IN A SEX MACHINE.

21:12.250 --> 21:14.169
SEX MACHINE? HONEY, WHAT DO
WE NEED ONE OF THOSE FOR?

21:14.170 --> 21:15.749
I AM A SEX MACHINE.

21:15.750 --> 21:18.209
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID
100 YEARS FROM NOW.

21:18.210 --> 21:20.329
AWW, IT'S SO NICE TO KNOW
YOU'LL NEVER CHANGE.

21:20.330 --> 21:22.170
YEAH, LISTEN, I LOVE YOU,
BUT YOU'RE CONTAGIOUS.
