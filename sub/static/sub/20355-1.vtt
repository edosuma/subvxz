01:47.360 --> 01:48.873
Stand by, flies.

01:49.640 --> 01:51.437
Stand by, flies.

01:51.480 --> 01:53.675
Stand by, flies.

01:58.840 --> 02:00.239
And cue.

02:01.160 --> 02:02.878
Cue!

02:02.920 --> 02:04.239
Cue!

02:25.320 --> 02:27.311
It is the cause,

02:27.360 --> 02:30.397
it is the cause, my soul,

02:30.440 --> 02:32.635
Let me not name it to you,

02:32.680 --> 02:34.830
you chaste stars!

02:34.880 --> 02:36.996
It is the cause.

02:37.040 --> 02:40.112
Yet I'll not shed her blood;

02:40.160 --> 02:44.392
Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,

02:44.440 --> 02:48.194
And smooth as monumental alabaster.

02:48.240 --> 02:50.595
Yet she must die,

02:50.640 --> 02:54.519
- else she'll betray more men.
- Sh!

02:54.560 --> 02:56.073
Put out the light,

02:56.120 --> 02:59.715
and then put out the light:

02:59.760 --> 03:03.799
If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,

03:03.840 --> 03:06.434
I can again thy former light restore,

03:06.480 --> 03:08.471
Should I repent me:

03:09.200 --> 03:12.158
But once put out thy light,

03:12.200 --> 03:15.988
thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,

03:16.920 --> 03:21.311
I know not where is that Promethean heat

03:21.360 --> 03:25.114
That can thy light relume.

03:32.720 --> 03:34.119
She wakes.

03:34.160 --> 03:35.878
Who's there?

03:35.920 --> 03:37.751
Othello?

03:37.800 --> 03:40.951
- Ay, Desdemona.
- Will you come to bed, my lord?

03:41.000 --> 03:44.993
- Have you pray'd tonight, Desdemona?
- Ay, my lord.

03:45.040 --> 03:51.639
If you bethink yourself of any crime
Unreconcil'd as yet to heaven and grace,

03:51.680 --> 03:54.797
Solicit for it straight.

03:54.840 --> 03:56.478
Alas, my lord!

03:57.600 --> 03:59.158
What do you mean by that?

03:59.200 --> 04:02.909
Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by:

04:02.960 --> 04:06.839
I would not kill thy unprepared spirit;

04:06.880 --> 04:09.917
No, heavens forfend!

04:09.960 --> 04:13.316
I would not kill thy soul.

04:13.360 --> 04:14.839
Talk you of killing?

04:15.880 --> 04:19.111
Ay, I do.

04:20.240 --> 04:21.911
What's the matter?

04:21.959 --> 04:27.034
That handkerchief
that I so lov'd and gave thee.

04:27.080 --> 04:29.355
Thou gav'st to Cassio.

04:29.400 --> 04:32.392
No, by my life and soul!

04:32.440 --> 04:34.317
Send for the man and ask him.

04:34.360 --> 04:35.918
Down, strumpet!

04:35.960 --> 04:37.996
Kill me tomorrow; let me live tonight!

04:38.040 --> 04:39.553
Nay, if you strive...

04:39.600 --> 04:42.068
- But half an hour!
- Being done, there is no pause.

04:42.120 --> 04:43.997
But while I say one prayer!

04:44.040 --> 04:45.996
It is too late!

05:01.480 --> 05:04.711
- Oh, my good lord...
Bravo! Bravo!

05:04.760 --> 05:06.512
Bravo!

05:08.800 --> 05:11.872
Oh, my good lord, yonder's...

05:12.800 --> 05:14.392
Bravo!

05:14.440 --> 05:16.237
Bravo, Mr Kynaston!

05:16.280 --> 05:18.475
...foul murders done!

05:18.520 --> 05:21.398
- Bravo!
- Well done, Mr Kynaston!

05:21.440 --> 05:23.158
Bravo!

05:23.200 --> 05:25.191
Kynaston! Kynaston!

05:30.600 --> 05:34.957
Oh, my good lord,
yonder's foul murders done.

05:37.960 --> 05:40.349
It's the same every bloody show!

05:40.400 --> 05:42.311
- It's not working.
- What do you mean?

05:42.360 --> 05:45.272
I'm trying to get to the end.
They're shouting, "Kynaston!"

05:45.320 --> 05:47.629
We haven't finished the show
for three weeks.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.035
- Fucking Ned Kynaston!
- Not again, Dickie!

05:50.080 --> 05:51.798
It's my scene his fans ruin.

05:51.840 --> 05:53.478
My entrance! My lines!

05:53.520 --> 05:55.750
Emilia dies too, you know.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.677
- Dear boy, I had no idea.
- That does it.

05:57.720 --> 06:01.235
- I serve my notice, Mr Betterton. I quit!
Mr Kynaston!

06:01.280 --> 06:04.317
Mr K! Mr K, you were brilliant!

06:04.360 --> 06:08.035
Such eyes, such hair,
such lips and voice to thrill.

06:08.080 --> 06:10.594
Surely you were the most beautiful
woman in the house.

06:10.640 --> 06:13.393
- See, Pepys likes it.
- I'm talking about my death scene.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.510
Something eludes me.
A gesture, a tone.

06:15.560 --> 06:17.710
You know what, Tommy?
I'm dying too soon.

06:17.760 --> 06:21.435
There's an actor for you.
My death scene doesn't go on long enough.

06:21.480 --> 06:23.550
Grasp the fact, Mr Kynaston.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.477
The performance is a grand success.

06:25.520 --> 06:29.308
What I don't grasp is this.
The King comes to the show last week...

06:29.360 --> 06:31.396
- This is Othello?
- This is Othello.

06:31.440 --> 06:32.953
And he says, the King says,

06:33.000 --> 06:34.672
"Bravo, Betterton.

06:34.720 --> 06:37.234
Wonderful show.
Lots of thrills and chills.

06:37.280 --> 06:40.590
We're coming again, Saturday next.
One question, though.

06:40.640 --> 06:42.596
Could you make it cheerier?"

06:42.640 --> 06:47.191
"Cheerier?" says I. "Yes," he said.
"Just make it a little bit more jolly. "

06:47.240 --> 06:48.992
So I say,

06:49.040 --> 06:52.794
"Your Majesty, Shakespeare ends his play
with Desdemona strangled,

06:52.840 --> 06:55.593
Emilia stabbed,
and Othello disembowelling himself.

06:55.640 --> 06:57.870
Do you suggest we do away with all that?"

06:57.920 --> 07:00.593
"Oh, no," he says, "kill 'em all.
Just make it jollier. "

07:00.640 --> 07:02.631
What none of you glean

07:02.680 --> 07:06.468
is that the King is expressing
a particularly salient view of the stage.

07:06.520 --> 07:09.637
Ah, Your Grace, what salient view
of the stage would that be?

07:09.680 --> 07:11.671
He wants surprises.

07:11.720 --> 07:14.632
The King's been away.
The theatre's been closed for 18 years.

07:14.680 --> 07:17.319
Now he's back, the theatres are open,
what does he find?

07:17.360 --> 07:19.351
The same old things.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.197
Poetry, he approves.

07:21.240 --> 07:23.754
- Ideas, he approves.
- Two ladies to see Mr Kynaston.

07:23.800 --> 07:27.475
- Death, tragedy, yes. But surprise him.
Are they of quality?

07:27.520 --> 07:30.717
What about sex, vis-Ã -vis the stage?

07:30.760 --> 07:33.957
The King approves of love, the idea.
What about sex, the expression?

07:34.000 --> 07:35.752
Poetry can express sex.

07:35.800 --> 07:37.631
So can sex.
Mr Kynaston,

07:37.680 --> 07:40.148
if you insist on something more graphic,
show a tit.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.919
- The King won't complain.
- How would you suggest I do that?

07:42.960 --> 07:44.109
Surprise me.

07:44.160 --> 07:47.038
Excuse me, two gentleladies
want to come backstage.

07:47.080 --> 07:49.116
Two of them? Excellent.

07:49.160 --> 07:51.116
They wish to be received
by Mr Kynaston.

07:51.160 --> 07:53.230
Five minutes. Then bring them back.

07:53.280 --> 07:56.272
Why five minutes?
Got to put my visage back on.

07:56.320 --> 07:59.153
They want the illusion,
not some green room hermaphrodite.

07:59.200 --> 08:02.272
- This, Tommy, is why I deserve a share.
- Oh, no.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.151
What are you two talking about?

08:04.200 --> 08:07.510
Mr Kynaston's contract is up.
He's putting the screws on me.

08:07.560 --> 08:10.757
I want a share of the company.
I'm as much a draw as you are. More so.

08:10.800 --> 08:11.915
Prove it!

08:11.960 --> 08:14.269
Well, where are your fans?
Where are your ladies?

08:14.320 --> 08:16.515
Oh, all right.

08:16.560 --> 08:19.233
But a share of the company
is out of the question.

08:19.280 --> 08:20.429
However

08:20.480 --> 08:24.871
as a gesture of faith to prove
that I am trying to find a way,

08:24.920 --> 08:27.150
in the interim, from this time forth,

08:27.200 --> 08:31.876
you can have approval of any actor
who shares the stage with you.

08:33.320 --> 08:36.756
- Gentlemen, you are my witnesses.
Noted.

08:36.799 --> 08:38.279
And I'm off to another show.

08:38.320 --> 08:39.753
What show?

08:39.799 --> 08:42.109
- Something new.
- I'll join you.

08:42.159 --> 08:45.914
Good show, Betterton.
Lovely as always, Mr K.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.518
- Your Grace.
- Gentlemen.

08:47.560 --> 08:48.959
Pepys!

08:49.000 --> 08:50.399
Mmm!

08:53.760 --> 08:55.318
Go away.

08:58.040 --> 09:00.474
Ah! Mr Betterton!

09:00.520 --> 09:03.159
Could I have a word with you
a moment, please?

09:03.200 --> 09:05.395
Oh, look, there's Mr Betterton!

09:06.320 --> 09:08.311
Evening, ladies.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.151
I wasn't good tonight.

09:23.360 --> 09:24.952
You were splendid.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.194
Yes.

09:27.680 --> 09:29.671
But I wasn't good.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.591
"Same old things. "

09:35.560 --> 09:38.358
Fortunately, they keep
giving us new audiences.

09:42.200 --> 09:44.156
Why does one act?

09:45.280 --> 09:47.271
When you act, you can be seen.

09:48.160 --> 09:49.912
Hmm?

09:51.640 --> 09:54.757
Greet your public.
It always cheers you up.

10:05.960 --> 10:07.359
Wait.

10:11.800 --> 10:13.279
Wait!

10:16.560 --> 10:17.595
Now

10:17.640 --> 10:20.313
Lady Meresvale and Miss Frayne.

10:23.520 --> 10:24.873
Oh!

10:24.920 --> 10:26.831
- You start.
- You do it.

10:26.880 --> 10:28.871
Oh, you do it. I'll die!

10:28.920 --> 10:31.718
Mr Kynaston, we saw
the performance this evening.

10:31.760 --> 10:34.638
We're such fans, I can't tell you.

10:34.680 --> 10:36.557
She's seen you six times. She has.

10:36.600 --> 10:39.319
Juliet and Ophelia.
And the one with no hands.

10:39.360 --> 10:42.716
Mr Kynaston, I am a great fan.

10:42.760 --> 10:44.273
And I was wondering...

10:44.320 --> 10:48.279
Well... Would you be willing to ride with us
through St James's tonight?

10:48.320 --> 10:50.276
It would be such an honour to have you.

10:50.320 --> 10:52.197
- Please, please, please!
- Please!

10:52.240 --> 10:54.754
If you give me half an hour
to remove my face and clothes.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.552
Oh, no, don't, please!

10:56.600 --> 10:59.512
Mr Kynaston, weod ke you
to eave you r appearance

10:59.560 --> 11:01.516
as is.

11:03.040 --> 11:04.632
He said yes!

11:04.680 --> 11:06.079
This is so good!

11:06.120 --> 11:07.917
Mr Kynaston, if I may,

11:07.960 --> 11:10.269
would you be able to make me
an advance on salary?

11:10.320 --> 11:12.993
- Advance? That's unlike you.
- Till the end of the week.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.917
- How much?
- Six.

11:21.920 --> 11:24.275
Thank you.
Will you be needing me later?

11:24.320 --> 11:26.072
Oh, yes. Hopeless without.

11:26.120 --> 11:28.190
How long do you think
you'll be with them?

11:29.840 --> 11:32.638
- Three hours, say?
- Yes, I'll be here.

11:32.680 --> 11:34.033
Mr Kynaston!

11:44.560 --> 11:46.676
Mr Kynaston!
- Is he coming?

11:46.720 --> 11:50.190
Do hurry up, Mr Kynaston, please!

11:53.160 --> 11:54.354
All these people!

11:55.480 --> 11:56.879
Mr Kynaston!

11:58.040 --> 11:59.598
MAN Are you an actor, too?

11:59.640 --> 12:01.198
I played the Moor.

12:01.240 --> 12:03.151
You look different.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.589
Yes, I'm not really black.

12:39.320 --> 12:40.469
Where were you?

12:40.520 --> 12:43.273
- Thought you'd abandoned us.
- I couldn't get away.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.756
- Did you bring it?
- She'd better had.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.028
Mr Cockerell.

12:48.080 --> 12:50.799
If you expect to perform,
I expect my guarantee.

12:50.840 --> 12:52.831
It's my risk, you know.

12:56.720 --> 12:58.870
It's illegal to have these on stage.

13:12.560 --> 13:14.596
Both of us

13:14.640 --> 13:16.631
were rather wondering

13:16.680 --> 13:19.797
if you were... really...

13:20.800 --> 13:23.633
...well, a gentleman.

13:24.840 --> 13:27.195
For, you see, my father's a wigmaker.

13:27.240 --> 13:30.118
He says you're much too beautiful
to be a gentleman.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.835
He says you must be a woman.

13:33.880 --> 13:37.714
My mother's friend,
the Earl of Lauderdale, says,

13:37.760 --> 13:40.638
if you're a man,

13:40.680 --> 13:42.750
you don't have a gentleman's thingy.

13:42.800 --> 13:45.598
He says you're like those Italian singers,
the whatsits?

13:45.640 --> 13:47.551
- Castrati.
- The Earl says

13:47.600 --> 13:51.195
they cut off your castrati at birth.

13:51.240 --> 13:52.514
Then you become a woman.

13:52.560 --> 13:54.551
So the Earl of Lauderdale is not a surgeon?

13:54.600 --> 13:56.795
No, he's an earl.

13:59.360 --> 14:00.873
Well...

14:02.040 --> 14:07.194
How then may we prove to both your
father and your mother's special friend...

14:08.560 --> 14:10.471
...that I do indeed

14:10.560 --> 14:12.551
have a thingy?

14:13.440 --> 14:16.432
A big, bulging,

14:16.480 --> 14:19.438
orb and sceptre of a thingy.

14:22.040 --> 14:23.678
Well, I...

14:23.720 --> 14:25.995
I... I think we'd...

14:26.040 --> 14:27.837
We'd have to...

14:28.840 --> 14:30.592
We'd have to...

14:30.640 --> 14:32.710
We'd have to touch it.

14:32.760 --> 14:34.910
Touch what?

14:34.960 --> 14:36.951
What?

14:39.120 --> 14:41.429
- What...
- Whatever it is.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.232
Oh!

14:46.680 --> 14:48.352
Mmm!

14:54.880 --> 14:58.555
If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,

14:58.600 --> 15:02.593
I can again thy former light restore,

15:02.640 --> 15:04.517
Should I repent me:

15:05.240 --> 15:07.435
But once put out thy light,

15:07.480 --> 15:11.712
thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,

15:11.760 --> 15:15.548
I know not where is that Promethean heat

15:15.600 --> 15:19.229
That can thy light relume.

15:21.640 --> 15:22.959
She wakes.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.275
Who's there? Othello?

15:31.400 --> 15:32.435
Whoa!

15:33.120 --> 15:34.189
Whoa!

15:36.160 --> 15:38.151
Oh, my!

15:39.440 --> 15:41.431
I think my wrist's broken.

15:41.480 --> 15:42.674
Oh, erm...

15:43.480 --> 15:44.674
Here.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.311
- What's this?
- A shilling.

15:47.360 --> 15:49.590
For services rendered.

15:51.360 --> 15:53.999
Women, beware!

15:54.040 --> 15:57.669
I see three fish eager and awaiting.

15:57.720 --> 16:00.359
Come, skewer on my pole!

16:00.400 --> 16:03.392
I know a playful bunch when I see 'em.

16:03.440 --> 16:06.591
Oh, painted ladies in the night!

16:06.640 --> 16:09.632
Universal sign for whores to let.

16:09.680 --> 16:11.636
How much for the each of you?

16:11.680 --> 16:14.433
For honour's sake, sir, assert yourself.

16:14.480 --> 16:17.358
Well, dear, how can I?
I'm but a wilting girl.

16:17.400 --> 16:19.277
Oh, come on, how much for a fuck?

16:19.320 --> 16:20.958
Do something!

16:21.000 --> 16:24.595
Very well. That one's a shilling,
that one's a penny. I'm five pounds a week.

16:24.640 --> 16:26.995
Sir, do you know who I am?

16:27.040 --> 16:28.792
I am Lady Aurelia Meresvale.

16:28.840 --> 16:30.751
- She's the shilling.
- Oh, you...!

16:30.800 --> 16:32.438
Driver, get us out of here!

16:32.480 --> 16:35.153
Wait a minute! I've got a shilling.

16:35.200 --> 16:36.997
Wait ho!

16:37.040 --> 16:38.712
I'm not done haggling yet.

16:38.760 --> 16:42.673
I warn you, sir, I doubt you'll find in me
what you're looking for.

16:42.720 --> 16:45.393
Oh, ho, ho! I'll be the judge of that.

16:46.240 --> 16:48.117
Now, come on

16:49.160 --> 16:50.878
Open up!

16:51.920 --> 16:54.992
Found a guardian at the gate, did you?

16:56.760 --> 16:58.193
Five pounds indeed.

16:58.240 --> 17:00.629
'Twas the weight, not the price.

17:00.680 --> 17:02.796
Wait a minute.

17:02.840 --> 17:04.830
Didn't say no, did I?

17:04.880 --> 17:07.189
I'm in the market for a mistress.

17:08.200 --> 17:09.997
A male one might be just the thing.

17:10.040 --> 17:12.792
- Sir, I am spoken for.
- Oh, come along!

17:15.480 --> 17:17.117
I shall never wear this glove again.

17:17.160 --> 17:20.196
- Ha, ha, ha!
- Mark me, bum boy!

17:20.240 --> 17:24.551
I shall see to you
and we shall settle this account.

17:30.440 --> 17:31.793
Two, three...

17:31.840 --> 17:34.149
four, five, six!

17:36.320 --> 17:37.309
Cheers!

17:37.360 --> 17:40.272
Even if it was only a one-off,
at least we did it once, eh?

17:40.320 --> 17:42.834
- And in under three hours!
- Oh, no, I have to go!

17:43.800 --> 17:46.519
- Maria!
- Maria, where are you going?

17:50.560 --> 17:52.152
- My dear!
- Mr Pepys!

17:52.200 --> 17:54.714
- Maria, that was quite a performance.
- Thank you, sir.

17:54.760 --> 17:56.318
- Hidden talents.
- Thank you.

17:56.360 --> 17:58.271
- Yes, well...
- Who'd have thought it?

17:58.320 --> 18:00.197
- Our secret, eh?
- Yes, quite.

18:00.240 --> 18:02.470
I say, do you know,
I was wondering, Maria,

18:02.520 --> 18:04.988
I know it is rather last-minute,
but still, if I may,

18:05.040 --> 18:06.837
tomorrow evening...

18:08.920 --> 18:10.797
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.995
If you're free, that is?

19:06.240 --> 19:08.310
What happened to my pillow?

19:09.320 --> 19:11.311
Oh, God, a tear.

19:11.360 --> 19:12.759
Did I do that?

19:12.800 --> 19:14.597
Ah, must have.

19:16.560 --> 19:19.677
Oh, we do not know our passions.

19:22.160 --> 19:24.594
Oh, Maria, I am exhausted.

19:25.520 --> 19:26.509
Why?

19:26.560 --> 19:30.439
Those two gentleladies wanted
to feel my cock for the sake of a wager.

19:30.480 --> 19:31.913
Ah.

19:31.960 --> 19:33.791
Are you in a hurry to get home?

19:33.840 --> 19:34.829
No.

19:34.880 --> 19:37.030
Help me.
I want to do the death scene again.

19:37.080 --> 19:38.308
- Now?
- Mm.

19:38.360 --> 19:40.430
All the elements are there.
It just feels off.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.118
The audience doesn't notice.

19:42.160 --> 19:44.355
<i>I'm not satisfied.</i>

19:44.400 --> 19:47.392
You be Othello. I'll be me.

19:47.440 --> 19:49.635
- Where do I start?
- I'll start.

19:52.720 --> 19:54.073
Alas...

19:55.720 --> 19:57.631
Alas, he is betray'd,

19:57.680 --> 19:59.989
and I... undone!

20:00.040 --> 20:01.871
Grab the pillow.

20:01.920 --> 20:04.673
Out, strumpet!
Weep'st thou for him to my face?

20:04.720 --> 20:07.598
O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!

20:07.640 --> 20:09.153
Down, strumpet!

20:09.200 --> 20:10.918
Kill me tomorrow; let me live tonight!

20:10.960 --> 20:13.269
- Now come at me.
- Nay, if you strive...

20:13.320 --> 20:16.471
- But half an hour!
- Being done, there is no pause.

20:16.520 --> 20:19.876
- But while I say one prayer!
- It is too late.

20:19.920 --> 20:22.388
Smother, smother, smother.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.991
She doesn't kiss him.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.791
What is it?

20:42.560 --> 20:44.755
Did they succeed?

20:44.800 --> 20:47.155
Did who succeed?

20:48.720 --> 20:50.711
The ladies.

20:50.760 --> 20:52.751
In feeling you.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.750
What kind of girl do you take me for?

21:06.360 --> 21:08.351
Help me with this.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.716
Do you want me to mend your pillow?

21:14.760 --> 21:18.036
Oh, do it tomorrow.
Day off. Plenty of time.

21:18.080 --> 21:19.957
You could use a new one.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.228
Maria...

21:22.480 --> 21:26.359
...this pillow was given to me
by my old tutor who found me in the gutter.

21:28.160 --> 21:29.912
He gave me a home.

21:29.960 --> 21:33.236
He gave us all a home, pretty boys like me.

21:35.800 --> 21:37.791
He taught us to read.

21:37.840 --> 21:41.116
He taught us Shakespeare,
all the tricks and turns and...

21:46.240 --> 21:49.152
He gave this to me
the first time I played Desdemona.

21:49.200 --> 21:51.316
"And remember," he'd say,

21:51.360 --> 21:53.794
"the part doesn't belong to an actor.

21:53.840 --> 21:56.115
An actor belongs to a part.

21:56.160 --> 21:58.230
Never forget.

21:58.280 --> 22:00.635
You're a man in woman's form. "

22:10.160 --> 22:12.151
Or was it the other way round?

22:18.520 --> 22:19.839
Well, he's dead now.

22:20.920 --> 22:22.831
Hard to prove either way.

22:24.080 --> 22:26.992
I think you'd be as fine a man as any woman.

22:33.560 --> 22:34.629
Maria...

22:37.280 --> 22:39.032
We are souls entwined.

22:40.880 --> 22:42.677
Off you go.

22:44.120 --> 22:46.429
I can shed my skin without you.

23:55.240 --> 23:57.231
Oh! Damn!

23:58.760 --> 23:59.988
Milady.

24:00.040 --> 24:01.837
Don't ever do that again!

24:02.960 --> 24:04.473
Oh, my God!

24:07.200 --> 24:09.191
What are you doing here?

24:09.240 --> 24:10.958
Thought I'd surprise you.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.479
Oh!

24:12.520 --> 24:15.830
- Where've you been?
- I was stranded in St James's Park.

24:15.880 --> 24:19.634
A frilly fop with a hard-on
thought I was a whore on the make.

24:19.680 --> 24:21.671
This is why I prefer Hyde Park.

24:21.720 --> 24:24.109
There's so much less of that sort of thing.

24:24.160 --> 24:26.071
So, what happened?

24:28.920 --> 24:31.036
Once he found my cock,

24:31.080 --> 24:32.718
off he went.

24:32.760 --> 24:35.672
It wasn't the case with me.

24:41.400 --> 24:43.038
Let me show you something.

24:48.720 --> 24:49.709
Here.

24:50.400 --> 24:51.913
Read.

24:54.320 --> 24:57.949
"I come unknown to any of the rest
to tell you news:

24:58.000 --> 24:59.718
I saw the lady drest.

24:59.760 --> 25:02.479
The woman plays today...

25:02.520 --> 25:05.080
The woman plays... " The woman?

25:05.120 --> 25:07.111
What? Hm?

25:07.160 --> 25:09.515
An actress.

25:10.680 --> 25:11.908
A what?

25:11.960 --> 25:13.473
An actress.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.033
At Cockerell's Tavern.

25:16.080 --> 25:17.832
The Cockpit put up a little stage.

25:17.880 --> 25:19.791
Very tatty, but still.

25:19.840 --> 25:21.910
My, my, it's a joke.

25:21.960 --> 25:25.236
- It's a fake. Jimmy Noakes...
- I know Jimmy Noakes.

25:25.280 --> 25:27.396
And it was not Jimmy Noakes.
It was not any man.

25:27.440 --> 25:28.668
It was a girl.

25:28.720 --> 25:30.039
But it's illegal.

25:30.080 --> 25:32.640
One did think as much.

25:33.800 --> 25:35.711
Wha...

25:36.400 --> 25:39.198
A woman playing a woman.
What's the trick in that?

25:40.120 --> 25:41.758
What was the play?

25:43.800 --> 25:45.677
No!

25:45.720 --> 25:48.757
If you're wondering,
she did not play the Moor.

25:53.480 --> 25:55.596
- How was she?
- What?

25:55.640 --> 25:58.791
Oh, you mean the acting?
I never noticed the acting.

25:58.840 --> 26:00.831
Did you go round after?

26:00.880 --> 26:02.871
Oh, too crowded. Pepys went.

26:02.920 --> 26:04.797
If two mice were fucking in a nutshell,

26:04.840 --> 26:07.149
he'd find room to squeeze in
and write it down.

26:07.200 --> 26:10.078
What was her name? The "actress"?

26:10.120 --> 26:12.634
- Er, Mrs Margaret Hughes.
... Margaret Hughes.

26:12.680 --> 26:15.990
The word is, she's going to be
at the Palace tomorrow night.

26:16.040 --> 26:17.553
The Palace?

26:18.560 --> 26:19.629
Oh...

26:19.680 --> 26:21.716
Are you invited?

26:21.760 --> 26:23.876
I'm the Duke of Buckingham.
I always am.

26:23.920 --> 26:25.319
Are you going?

26:25.360 --> 26:27.157
- I might drop by.
- Take me there.

26:29.320 --> 26:31.311
- You want to go to the Palace?
- Yes.

26:32.320 --> 26:34.072
- With me?
- Yes.

26:37.120 --> 26:40.078
You'll go as an acquaintance
who behaves himself.

26:40.120 --> 26:43.635
If you try to grow your part,
you'll find the role's been cut.

26:45.240 --> 26:46.798
Agreed.

26:47.800 --> 26:49.791
Right, then. Oh, Ned...

26:51.680 --> 26:53.671
Put this on, will you?

26:56.960 --> 27:00.270
I like to see a golden flow as I die in you.

27:32.120 --> 27:35.192
Would you ask your lady whores
to wear a wig to bed?

27:36.200 --> 27:38.191
If it made them more a woman.

27:54.160 --> 27:59.393
# Who can resist
such mighty, mighty charms?

27:59.840 --> 28:01.956
# Who can resist

28:02.000 --> 28:04.468
# Such mighty, mighty charms?

28:04.520 --> 28:10.117
# Victorious, victorious, victorious love

28:10.160 --> 28:12.799
<i># Who can resist
# Who can resist</i>

28:13.200 --> 28:15.919
<i># Who can resist
# Who can resist</i>

28:15.960 --> 28:17.951
# Who can resist

28:18.000 --> 28:24.838
# Such mighty charms?

28:24.880 --> 28:26.871
# Such mighty, mighty

28:26.920 --> 28:30.595
# Mighty, mighty charms

28:30.640 --> 28:33.757
Bravo! Bravo!

28:33.800 --> 28:35.518
Well done!

28:41.720 --> 28:43.517
Ha, ha!

28:43.560 --> 28:48.156
His Grace, the Duke of Buckingham,
and Mr Edward Kynaston!

28:48.200 --> 28:49.599
George, you're late!

28:49.640 --> 28:51.278
Your Majesty.

28:51.320 --> 28:53.276
I thought you'd skipped us.

28:54.920 --> 28:56.911
And Kynaston?

28:56.960 --> 28:59.269
- I know you. You're...
- The actor.

28:59.320 --> 29:01.629
- Oh, yes, you were in...
- Othello, sir.

29:01.680 --> 29:03.591
This Thursday last at Mr Betterton's.

29:03.640 --> 29:06.438
Were you? Not lago, I hope.
I didn't like him.

29:06.480 --> 29:08.072
I played Desdemona.

29:08.120 --> 29:10.509
Ah! That Kynaston.

29:11.400 --> 29:13.197
Late wife of the murderous Moor.

29:13.240 --> 29:15.913
Went to see the show last week

29:15.960 --> 29:17.279
The curtain was late.

29:17.320 --> 29:18.673
I said, "What's the matter?"

29:18.720 --> 29:21.632
They said, "Your Majesty,
Desdemona is still shaving. "

29:21.680 --> 29:24.877
You paint a blush upon me, sir.

29:24.920 --> 29:27.992
Do you know Miss Gwynn,
my pretty, witty Nell?

29:28.040 --> 29:30.315
Mr Kynaston, I am a great admirer.

29:30.360 --> 29:32.032
Oh!

29:32.080 --> 29:34.310
Nell is the most ardent theatregoer in London.

29:34.360 --> 29:35.634
I used to be an orange girl.

29:35.680 --> 29:39.753
I worked the stalls before,
during and after every performance.

29:39.800 --> 29:43.190
Oranges! Oranges!

29:43.240 --> 29:45.276
Two pence a pair!
Yes, exactly

29:45.320 --> 29:48.118
Kynaston, about the Othello.

29:48.160 --> 29:50.071
Saw it last week. Good show.

29:50.120 --> 29:52.588
But it needed changes.
You see, it could be a bit...

29:52.640 --> 29:54.676
- Jollier?
- That's what I said.

29:54.720 --> 29:55.948
Yes, what we want are...

29:56.000 --> 29:57.911
- Surprises?
- Exactly.

29:57.960 --> 29:59.837
But we don't want to know they're coming.

29:59.880 --> 30:01.836
Mr Samuel Pepys!

30:01.880 --> 30:04.030
And Mrs Margaret Hughes!

30:04.080 --> 30:06.389
- Your Majesty.
- Pepys, you brought a guest.

30:06.440 --> 30:08.158
Mrs Hughes,

30:08.200 --> 30:11.237
- Miss Gwynn.
- I'd take your hand but my tit'd fall out.

30:12.280 --> 30:13.918
And Mr Kynaston.

30:14.920 --> 30:16.717
K N Gg Hon, are you overcome?

30:16.760 --> 30:19.274
- Oh, dear.
- Are you all right, Mrs Hughes?

30:19.320 --> 30:21.788
- Yes...
Sir Charles Sedley.

30:21.840 --> 30:24.274
Sedley, I think you know everyone here.

30:24.320 --> 30:27.312
Except for Mrs Hughes and Mr Kynaston.

30:27.960 --> 30:30.394
Kynaston...

30:30.440 --> 30:32.715
It feels I've had the honour already.

30:32.760 --> 30:35.479
Or you've already had the honour of feeling it.

30:35.520 --> 30:37.875
Obviously, I'm behind in my drinking.

30:37.920 --> 30:41.037
- Shall we go in for dinner?
- Oh, we're deeply privileged.

30:41.080 --> 30:42.832
Lady Jane Bellamy, follow me.

30:42.880 --> 30:45.235
Allow me, Mrs Hughes.

30:45.280 --> 30:47.748
- I can explain everything.
- Are you a philosopher?

30:47.800 --> 30:51.793
You, Pepys, the Duke, this is all some
great joke the three of you are playing.

30:51.840 --> 30:53.717
Mr Kynaston, I had no idea...

30:53.760 --> 30:55.751
Mrs Hughes, will you sit next to me?

30:57.240 --> 30:59.231
Don't make a scene.

31:00.240 --> 31:03.550
George, do you know Lady Jane Bellamy?

31:03.600 --> 31:06.160
No, but I certainly hope to.

31:10.320 --> 31:12.390
Tell me about your parentage, Miss Gwynn.

31:12.440 --> 31:14.590
My mum was a whore,
my father in the navy.

31:14.640 --> 31:17.473
- I see.
- That's why I don't never do sailors.

31:18.680 --> 31:21.319
I'm sorry I missed your performance tonight,
Miss Gwynn.

31:21.360 --> 31:23.112
- Will you do it again?
- No.

31:23.160 --> 31:25.151
And all that for a one-off.

31:25.200 --> 31:27.475
Work, work, work, and it's over in a pop.

31:27.520 --> 31:29.988
- Like Charlie.
- What, my dear?

31:30.040 --> 31:35.831
Miss Gwynn, I remind you,
you are speaking of the Father of his People.

31:35.880 --> 31:38.792
Well... a lot of 'em.

31:38.840 --> 31:41.593
Mrs Hughes, have you seen
Mr Kynaston perform?

31:41.640 --> 31:44.791
He's doing Desdemona in Othello now.

31:44.840 --> 31:47.718
- You've seen it, George?
- Yes. I never tire of Othello.

31:47.760 --> 31:50.672
Truth be told, sir,
he never tires of Desdemona.

31:53.200 --> 31:56.988
Kynaston, isn't there someone else
who does Desdemona?

31:57.840 --> 32:00.400
- Can't think of his name now.
James Noakes.

32:00.440 --> 32:03.352
Yes, good actor Noakes

32:03.400 --> 32:05.994
Not quite his part, though.
Doesn't have your beauty.

32:06.040 --> 32:09.476
No, Kynaston,
Desdemona is yours alone. Ha, ha!

32:09.520 --> 32:13.035
Well, but if I may, sir...

32:13.080 --> 32:16.311
A part doesn't belong to an actor,
an actor belongs to a part.

32:17.960 --> 32:20.428
Don't you agree, sir?

32:25.480 --> 32:26.879
Don't know.

32:28.240 --> 32:29.992
Do you agree, Mr Kynaston?

32:30.040 --> 32:33.999
Oh, well, there have been
other Desdemonas before me, sir.

32:34.040 --> 32:38.113
There will be more after. In fact, the Duke of
Buckingham saw another one just last night.

32:38.160 --> 32:39.798
Did you, Your Grace?

32:39.840 --> 32:42.638
George, what performance
does Mr Kynaston refer to?

32:42.680 --> 32:44.079
You showed me the fly bill.

32:45.080 --> 32:47.514
I think I have it. Yes, here it is.

32:51.680 --> 32:53.716
The Cockpit Tavern.

32:53.760 --> 32:56.115
Yes, that was name of the theatre, wasn't it?

32:56.160 --> 32:58.879
Well, it wasn't strictly a theatre.

32:58.920 --> 33:00.876
"The woman...

33:00.920 --> 33:02.399
plays today

33:02.440 --> 33:03.839
Mrs Margaret... "

33:08.280 --> 33:09.429
Mrs Hughes.

33:09.480 --> 33:11.471
Is this you?

33:13.360 --> 33:14.634
Yes.

33:16.200 --> 33:17.349
You?

33:18.360 --> 33:19.952
A woman?

33:20.000 --> 33:22.673
Performed in a play?

33:22.720 --> 33:27.396
In a public theatre
against the order of the Crown?

33:27.440 --> 33:31.035
As His Grace said, it's not a real theatre.

33:31.080 --> 33:34.072
It's more a sort of tavern,
and hence, outside...

33:34.120 --> 33:36.953
I am the First Minister, Mrs Hughes.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.036
I know what the law...

33:39.080 --> 33:41.071
Mrs Hughes.

33:41.120 --> 33:44.476
This performance of yours,
was it too a one-off?

33:44.520 --> 33:47.592
Well, sir, it certainly was novel.

33:47.640 --> 33:49.870
But we had hoped to have more chances.

33:49.920 --> 33:52.195
That's the tricky thing about novelty.

33:52.240 --> 33:54.470
Do it more than once, it's not novel any more.

33:54.520 --> 33:56.192
That may be true, Mr Kynaston.

33:56.240 --> 34:00.074
But in the theatre, I am told,
there are no old shows, just new audiences.

34:00.120 --> 34:01.109
Ha!

34:01.160 --> 34:03.958
- Are you going to do it again?
- She most certainly is not.

34:04.000 --> 34:08.072
Sir, I insist you issue a proclamation

34:08.120 --> 34:10.350
- closing this Cockpit...
- But, Charlie!

34:10.400 --> 34:11.958
- Sir...
- Silence!

34:18.520 --> 34:20.511
When my father was alive,

34:20.560 --> 34:24.599
it had long been illegal
for a woman to perform in public.

34:24.639 --> 34:28.315
In the Palace, of course,
it was women galore.

34:28.360 --> 34:31.272
Private musicales, masques...

34:31.320 --> 34:33.629
No-one gave a damn.

34:33.679 --> 34:36.239
Except... the clerics.

34:37.280 --> 34:38.395
One minister,

34:38.440 --> 34:40.158
a Mr Prynne,

34:40.960 --> 34:46.751
wrote a pamphlet against all actresses
as lewd women...

34:46.800 --> 34:48.791
and whores.

34:51.760 --> 34:53.591
Now

34:53.639 --> 34:55.630
my mother

34:55.679 --> 34:59.912
acted in some of those court masques.

35:00.920 --> 35:04.833
And she felt Mr Prynne's diatribe
was directed at her.

35:05.840 --> 35:10.231
So, Mr Prynne was tried,

35:10.280 --> 35:12.271
convicted,

35:12.320 --> 35:14.754
and sentenced to the stocks.

35:18.280 --> 35:21.750
Where his feet were burned,
his ears lopped off,

35:21.800 --> 35:23.791
and his tongue cut out.

35:23.840 --> 35:25.239
Yet...

35:25.280 --> 35:27.271
in spite of all this,

35:27.320 --> 35:30.278
Mr Prynne never recanted.

35:31.680 --> 35:36.800
Some say his stoicism
in the face of such excess...

35:37.800 --> 35:41.429
...is what fanned the flames
of the Puritan revolt.

35:43.320 --> 35:47.359
And so, off with my father's head.

35:49.800 --> 35:53.236
And I to Holland for 20 years.

35:58.840 --> 36:01.957
I think it might be fun
to see women on the stage.

36:02.960 --> 36:05.633
They have had them in France
for a long time now.

36:06.680 --> 36:07.874
Yes.

36:08.880 --> 36:12.793
Whenever we're about
to do something truly horrible,

36:12.840 --> 36:15.957
we always say
the French have been doing it for years.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.719
Hyde, issue a proclamation.

36:18.760 --> 36:23.276
Permission to perform is hereby granted.

36:24.280 --> 36:27.033
For Mrs Hughes?

36:27.080 --> 36:29.958
To all women.

36:38.520 --> 36:42.354
We wish to see this new Othello
at the earliest possible convenience.

36:42.400 --> 36:43.628
Say, Saturday.

36:43.680 --> 36:45.079
Make note, Hyde.

36:45.120 --> 36:47.190
Saturday, Othello.

36:47.240 --> 36:48.559
The other one.

36:49.000 --> 36:53.312
So, Kynaston,
will you see Mrs Hughes perform?

36:53.360 --> 36:56.193
I'd love to know
what you think of the death scene.

36:56.240 --> 36:59.198
Oh, I'm always interested
in how my rivals die.

36:59.240 --> 37:00.832
Your Grace?

37:00.880 --> 37:04.714
Well, no. I've had my fill of Desdemonas.

37:04.760 --> 37:08.036
Shall I escort you home, Mrs Hughes?

37:08.080 --> 37:10.275
<i>- Yes.
I'll see Mrs Hughes home.</i>

37:10.320 --> 37:12.880
I suddenly find myself a devotee of the stage.

37:12.920 --> 37:14.911
Not in an artistic sense, of course.

37:14.960 --> 37:17.190
<i>But as a sort of patron</i>

37:17.240 --> 37:21.074
I'm off as well. Kynaston... shall I drop you?

37:21.120 --> 37:22.758
Yes, I need my sleep.

37:22.800 --> 37:27.430
We're auditioning new Emilias tomorrow,
then two shows of you know what.

37:28.360 --> 37:30.351
Mrs Hughes, perhaps I'll see you there?

37:31.200 --> 37:32.428
Sir Charles.

37:34.440 --> 37:37.352
"I shall never wear this glove again. "

37:43.440 --> 37:44.998
Mrs Hughes.

37:45.040 --> 37:49.352
The Cockpit Tavern is no place
for someone of your particular attractions.

37:49.400 --> 37:53.712
I think you should audition
for Mr Betterton's theatre tomorrow.

37:53.760 --> 37:56.957
I couldn't. What about Mr Kynaston?

37:57.960 --> 37:59.439
Surprise him.

38:16.320 --> 38:19.630
Morning, Mr Kynaston.
Your picture's selling well.

38:27.240 --> 38:29.231
Anyone want to buy a rabbit?

38:30.680 --> 38:32.033
Mr Kynaston.

38:40.880 --> 38:42.518
Mr Betterton.

38:42.560 --> 38:44.232
I wish to discuss with you

38:44.280 --> 38:45.713
the role of Emilia.

38:45.760 --> 38:48.069
Bit over the top for that, aren't we, sunshine?

38:48.120 --> 38:50.634
Not me, sir. Not me.

38:50.680 --> 38:54.195
I come to speak
on behalf of Mrs Margaret Hughes.

38:55.200 --> 38:57.919
- Mr Kynaston.
- Aha! Mrs Hughes. Settling in, I see.

38:57.960 --> 38:59.951
That dress one of mine?

39:00.000 --> 39:01.353
I made it for myself.

39:01.400 --> 39:04.995
Oh, of course you did.
You're so good at the needle and pin.

39:05.040 --> 39:07.873
- Mr Kynaston, I must apologise...
- Oh, no, no.

39:07.920 --> 39:12.038
Please. Just a question, as you are
quite obviously going to audition today.

39:12.080 --> 39:15.595
Do you know the Five Positions
of Feminine Subjugation?

39:15.640 --> 39:17.392
What?

39:17.440 --> 39:21.115
The Five Positions
of Feminine Subjugation. No?

39:21.160 --> 39:24.596
Or perhaps you're more acquainted
with the Pose of Tragic Acceptance?

39:24.640 --> 39:26.437
Or the Demeanour of Awe and Terror?

39:26.480 --> 39:28.550
- Mr Kynaston...
- The Supplicant's Clasp?

39:28.600 --> 39:30.113
Or the Attitude of Prostrate...

39:30.160 --> 39:32.958
Funny, you've seen me perform them
a thousand times.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.037
- Mr Kynaston!
- Now, there's a feminine gesture.

39:36.080 --> 39:39.595
You seem to have managed
the Stamp of Girlish Petulance.

39:41.600 --> 39:43.079
I just wanted to act.

39:43.120 --> 39:45.918
<i>- I just wanted to do what you do.
- But, madam,</i>

39:45.960 --> 39:48.633
I have worked half my life to do what I do.

39:49.640 --> 39:51.631
14 boys crammed in a cellar.

39:51.680 --> 39:55.389
When I trained, I was not permitted to
wear a woman's dress for three years.

39:55.440 --> 39:58.352
I was not permitted to wear a wig for four,
not until I had proved

39:58.400 --> 40:02.951
that I had eliminated every masculine gesture,
every masculine intonation, from my very being.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.434
What teacher did you have?
What cellar was your home?

40:05.480 --> 40:07.516
I had no teacher, nor such a classroom.

40:07.560 --> 40:10.472
But then, I had less need of training.

40:10.520 --> 40:14.195
At any rate, Mr Kynaston,
I thank you for the professional advice.

40:14.240 --> 40:16.549
But I did not come here today to audition.

40:16.600 --> 40:19.637
Oh, come, I saw Sedley downstairs
singing your praises...

40:19.680 --> 40:21.750
What he does is his business.

40:21.800 --> 40:24.473
Sir Charles has taken an interest in me.

40:24.520 --> 40:26.590
Oh, Sir Charles! Sir Charles?

40:26.640 --> 40:30.428
Other actors have aristocratic patrons.
Whom would you rather take me in hand?

40:30.480 --> 40:34.473
I did not come here to audition.
I only came to the theatre today

40:34.520 --> 40:36.511
- to collect my belongings...
- Well...

40:36.560 --> 40:38.278
But now, sir!

40:38.320 --> 40:39.958
Oh, now...

40:42.360 --> 40:44.669
Oh, lest I forget.

40:46.080 --> 40:48.071
Your advance, sir.

40:48.120 --> 40:52.636
You'll be pleased to know it was your generosity
that bought last night's performance.

40:52.680 --> 40:54.671
Put paid.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.711
With interest.

40:59.120 --> 41:01.429
You want to pay me
to watch an audition?

41:01.480 --> 41:04.392
This could start a trend.
Who is your protÃ©gÃ©?

41:04.440 --> 41:07.910
Mr Betterton, this is Mrs Margaret Hughes.

41:09.960 --> 41:11.029
Maria?

41:11.080 --> 41:14.231
- Maria?
- It's an off-stage name.

41:14.280 --> 41:16.032
Oh, wait a minute.

41:16.080 --> 41:19.834
So the Hughes that played
at Cockerell's place last night

41:19.880 --> 41:22.030
was... was... our Maria?

41:22.080 --> 41:25.390
All of London is talking about
Mrs Hughes' performance.

41:25.440 --> 41:29.069
And, as you know, the King has,
just this past evening, relaxed the laws

41:29.120 --> 41:31.350
- against women playing women.
- Yes, I heard.

41:31.400 --> 41:33.834
And, as this is your day, Mr Betterton,

41:33.880 --> 41:36.348
- to seek out new Emilias...
- Yes, yes, I see.

41:36.400 --> 41:38.709
Ned, just in time! Such drama.

41:38.760 --> 41:42.150
Our very own Maria is going to take the stage.

41:42.200 --> 41:45.590
Do you have a scene for us, Maria... Er, Mrs...

41:45.640 --> 41:47.995
- I do, actually.
- Well, er...

41:48.040 --> 41:51.112
- What will you be doing for us today?
- A soliloquy.

41:51.160 --> 41:53.435
- From?
- Othello.

41:53.480 --> 41:55.152
And the role?

41:56.320 --> 41:57.469
Desdemona.

41:57.520 --> 41:59.112
Well...

41:59.160 --> 42:00.673
This should be fun.

42:05.120 --> 42:06.519
Sir Charles.

42:18.280 --> 42:19.759
Thank you, Mrs Hughes.

42:28.600 --> 42:31.194
What shall I do to win my lord again?

42:31.240 --> 42:33.708
Good friends, go to him;

42:33.760 --> 42:35.955
for, by this light of heaven,

42:36.000 --> 42:37.991
I know not how...

42:41.160 --> 42:42.559
May I start again?

42:42.600 --> 42:44.079
Oh, please.

42:44.120 --> 42:45.951
Thank you.

42:47.280 --> 42:50.317
What shall I do to win my lord again?

42:50.360 --> 42:52.874
Good friends, go to him;

42:52.920 --> 42:54.911
for, by this light of heaven...

42:55.680 --> 42:57.875
I know not how...

42:59.320 --> 43:00.719
I know not how...

43:02.240 --> 43:03.673
I know not how...

43:04.960 --> 43:07.758
- I know not how...
- I know not how I lost him.

43:09.440 --> 43:11.635
Yes, of course. Thank you.

43:11.680 --> 43:13.875
Not at all. I say it every night.

43:18.600 --> 43:20.431
May I begin again?

43:20.480 --> 43:22.675
Oh, heavens.
I was going to suggest it myself.

43:25.840 --> 43:28.149
- I know not how...
- I know not how I lost him.

43:28.880 --> 43:32.077
What shall I do to win my lord again?

43:32.120 --> 43:34.634
Good friends, go to him;

43:34.680 --> 43:36.636
for, by this light of heaven,

43:36.680 --> 43:38.636
I know not how I lost him.

43:38.680 --> 43:41.797
If e'er my will did trespass
'gainst his love,

43:41.840 --> 43:46.118
Either in discourse of thought
or actual deed;

43:46.160 --> 43:49.835
Or that mine eyes, mine ears,
or any sense,

43:49.880 --> 43:52.553
Delighted them in any other form;

43:52.600 --> 43:54.875
Or that I do not yet,

43:54.920 --> 43:56.956
and ever did,

43:57.000 --> 43:58.228
And ever will,

43:58.280 --> 44:00.430
- though he do shake me off

44:00.480 --> 44:02.914
To beggarly divorcement, -

44:02.960 --> 44:05.428
love him dearly,

44:05.480 --> 44:07.789
Comfort forswear me!

44:07.840 --> 44:10.718
Unkindness may do much;

44:10.760 --> 44:15.197
And his unkindness may defeat my life,

44:15.240 --> 44:16.798
But never taint...

44:18.560 --> 44:20.551
my love

44:31.800 --> 44:33.233
That was it.

44:34.640 --> 44:36.631
Was it? Oh, yes!

44:36.680 --> 44:38.591
Yes, yes, of course it was.

44:38.640 --> 44:40.358
I was caught up with the...

44:40.400 --> 44:42.914
by the gestures and such.

44:42.960 --> 44:45.793
Well, well, I, I... I've er...

44:45.840 --> 44:49.355
I've never seen the role performed
quite... quite like that before.

44:49.400 --> 44:51.675
Do you think
there might be something for me?

44:51.720 --> 44:55.030
Er, I don't know. It... depends.

44:55.080 --> 44:56.069
On?

44:56.120 --> 44:58.839
On thousands of actors ahead of you
dying of the plague.

44:58.880 --> 45:00.598
- Intolerable!
- Ned's being funny.

45:00.640 --> 45:04.838
It depends on the audiences of London
losing their eyes, their ears...

45:04.880 --> 45:07.030
And truth be told, their sense of smell.

45:07.080 --> 45:10.834
I confess, Mrs Hughes, when I heard
about your performance, I was worried.

45:10.880 --> 45:13.474
Women on stage.
What would become of me?

45:13.520 --> 45:16.080
And then, you auditioned for us.

45:16.120 --> 45:18.634
You have taken a great load off my mind.

45:22.520 --> 45:24.829
Mr Betterton, thank you for your time.

45:24.880 --> 45:26.836
Maria, my dear...

45:26.880 --> 45:28.677
No, sir, I'm late for Mr Cockerell's.

45:28.720 --> 45:32.429
Dear, dear. Well, good luck with the show.
I'd love to pop in and see it...

45:32.480 --> 45:34.914
Yes, I'd arrange tickets, but we're sold out.

45:34.960 --> 45:36.678
Sold out?

45:37.560 --> 45:39.312
Maria, Maria.

45:39.360 --> 45:40.554
Er, Mrs Hughes.

45:40.600 --> 45:42.591
Come, come, come.

45:42.640 --> 45:43.914
Ned, Ned.

45:44.880 --> 45:49.476
What say we give Mrs Hughes
one of the roles to play?

45:49.520 --> 45:53.115
No, no, not you know whno,
that's you, of course

45:53.160 --> 45:56.038
But we are looking for an Emilia.
She might just...

45:56.080 --> 45:57.877
splash things up a bit.

45:57.920 --> 45:59.399
What do you say?

45:59.440 --> 46:01.431
I- I-I refuse.

46:02.960 --> 46:04.598
What do you mean, you refuse?

46:04.640 --> 46:06.756
I shall not act with her.

46:06.800 --> 46:10.156
- On what right?
- My right, Mr Betterton.

46:10.200 --> 46:14.113
You gave me approval over casting
and I hereby exercise said right.

46:14.160 --> 46:16.515
But she's sold out Cockerell's.

46:16.560 --> 46:19.870
Indeed! The place was packed
and the crowd clapped and clapped.

46:19.920 --> 46:23.276
I recall a puppet show once
where a recently-departed dog was stuffed

46:23.320 --> 46:26.437
and danced with Punch and Judy
and that crowd clapped, too.

46:26.480 --> 46:28.357
Oh, Ned...

46:28.400 --> 46:31.073
If you argue the case
for Mrs Hughes further, indeed...

46:31.120 --> 46:35.796
If you attempt to audition her
or any other woman ever again,

46:35.840 --> 46:40.231
I will consider it a breach of contract
and leave the stage forthwith!

46:41.560 --> 46:42.629
Bitch!

46:43.560 --> 46:46.552
I had myself intended to audition today.

46:47.680 --> 46:50.274
But if this is how you treat women,

46:50.320 --> 46:52.834
well, mark me, sir,

46:52.880 --> 46:55.189
women shall lay blame.

47:01.800 --> 47:03.995
Who the hell was that?

47:04.040 --> 47:05.234
That...

47:06.400 --> 47:07.799
...is the King's mistress.

47:07.840 --> 47:10.798
This shall be remembered, Betterton.

47:15.480 --> 47:18.074
Oh, my God. Er, Sir Charles.

47:18.960 --> 47:20.234
Sir Charles...

47:21.240 --> 47:22.639
Mr Kynaston.

47:22.680 --> 47:25.672
I am a man of my contract and my word.

47:25.720 --> 47:28.917
You exercise your right today.

47:28.960 --> 47:31.394
I, mine, tomorrow!

47:38.640 --> 47:42.394
This vile thespian is in need of a come-down

47:42.440 --> 47:44.954
and on his own turf!

47:57.040 --> 47:59.429
- Nell, is that you?
- Yes.

47:59.480 --> 48:01.118
What is it, sweet?

48:01.160 --> 48:02.991
- Charlie?
- Mm?

48:03.040 --> 48:05.395
You love me, don't you?

48:09.520 --> 48:11.033
Well, I've always said.

48:12.040 --> 48:14.838
And you'd never deny me?

48:14.880 --> 48:16.950
Now, what do you want?

48:22.920 --> 48:24.148
No, I can't.

48:24.200 --> 48:26.236
- Please!
- It's out of the question.

48:26.280 --> 48:28.032
I'll never ask another favour.

48:28.080 --> 48:29.718
No!

48:29.760 --> 48:32.593
- Charlie...
- Nell, I've work to do.

48:32.640 --> 48:34.437
- Please...
- Charlie boy.

48:34.480 --> 48:36.630
Where's his toy?

48:36.680 --> 48:38.511
No, this is very important business.

48:38.560 --> 48:40.790
We are at war with the... Dutch.

48:40.840 --> 48:43.115
Oh, Your Majesty!

48:43.160 --> 48:45.151
Let me see the crown!

49:13.320 --> 49:17.233
Hyde, erm...
I want to dictate something.

49:36.040 --> 49:37.359
Are you all right, sir?

49:42.040 --> 49:45.032
Now, St James's Park, the gazebo.

50:03.600 --> 50:05.591
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

50:06.840 --> 50:08.831
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

50:14.800 --> 50:18.793
We're going to really hurt him because...
But we can't do too much. We can't do...

50:20.760 --> 50:22.671
Kynaston! Kynaston!

50:26.880 --> 50:29.075
Bravo, Mr Kynaston! Bravo!

50:29.120 --> 50:30.997
Kynaston! Kynaston!

50:37.320 --> 50:39.311
Not like that.

50:44.200 --> 50:47.078
Mr Ned, sir? We need to see you

50:47.120 --> 50:49.076
Mr Kynaston.

50:49.120 --> 50:53.830
Mr Kynaston, we wish to apologise
for our rudeness the other day.

50:53.880 --> 50:56.633
We wish to make things up with you.

50:56.680 --> 50:58.875
May we take you for a drive?

50:59.880 --> 51:01.359
May we?

51:13.720 --> 51:15.711
Why have we stopped?

51:15.760 --> 51:18.558
Come with us, Mr Kynaston.

51:19.560 --> 51:21.551
What are you up to?

51:21.600 --> 51:25.798
<i>It's more a question
of what you're up to.</i>

51:25.840 --> 51:28.912
Have you ever had occasion
to perform out- of-doors?

51:29.640 --> 51:32.359
Er, not that I can recall.

51:32.400 --> 51:34.038
Then I beg you, sir,

51:34.080 --> 51:35.718
flatter us,

51:35.760 --> 51:37.990
who do not deserve your good graces.

51:45.000 --> 51:45.910
Hmm.

51:47.200 --> 51:48.872
You mocked us, sir!

51:48.920 --> 51:50.592
You, an actor, mocked your betters.

51:50.640 --> 51:53.393
You shall know
the other end of it now, bum-boy!

51:54.640 --> 51:57.791
Here is the whore of the Moor of Venice.

51:57.840 --> 52:00.832
- Where's your frock, my girl?
You mistake me, gentlemen!

52:00.880 --> 52:02.757
- No mistake!
- 'Tis he. The slut himself.

52:02.800 --> 52:05.473
- Just as we have been foretold!
Hit him again!

52:06.160 --> 52:07.559
I have in hand an edict.

52:07.600 --> 52:10.592
I wish it passed, put down in law,

52:10.640 --> 52:14.235
and circulated throughout
the affected areas posthaste.

52:14.280 --> 52:17.158
A Royal licensing law,

52:17.200 --> 52:20.988
which states, in binding language,
as does follow:

52:21.040 --> 52:24.271
Whereas the women's parts in plays

52:24.320 --> 52:27.995
have hitherto been acted by men
in the habits of women,

52:28.040 --> 52:31.874
at which some have taken offence,

52:31.920 --> 52:35.674
we do permit and give leave,
for the time to come,

52:36.520 --> 52:40.911
that all women's parts
be acted by women.

52:42.880 --> 52:45.269
No He shall e'er again...

52:46.240 --> 52:48.310
...upon an English stage

52:48.360 --> 52:50.271
play she

53:27.440 --> 53:31.752
Mrs Hughes, though it be true
that talent is as talent does,

53:31.800 --> 53:35.236
whilst beauty fades
like starlight at the break of day,

53:35.280 --> 53:38.750
surely you recognise the fact
that you are, without doubt,

53:38.800 --> 53:41.394
the most beautiful woman
on the English stage.

53:41.440 --> 53:43.749
I am an actress, not a beauty.

53:43.800 --> 53:45.119
Be that as it may,

53:45.160 --> 53:50.393
if I am to paint your beauty, Mrs Hughes,
I must paint it with tit exposed.

53:50.440 --> 53:55.389
How else prove to the theatregoers
of London that you are a real woman?

54:04.640 --> 54:07.552
Want to be taken as a serious actress

54:08.840 --> 54:13.516
My dear, before you can be taken seriously,
you must put bums on seats.

54:23.720 --> 54:25.153
All right, paint!

54:26.160 --> 54:29.755
And thus is flesh made art.

54:34.240 --> 54:36.117
Kynaston

54:36.160 --> 54:38.151
I see your wounds are on the mend.

54:38.200 --> 54:41.988
Yes, I was fallen upon
by a gang of critics.

54:42.040 --> 54:45.589
When will you be
back on stage, Mr K? Soon, I hope.

54:45.640 --> 54:48.108
- As soon as they'll let me.
- Physicians, eh?

54:49.240 --> 54:54.360
- What role will mark your return?
- What else but Desdemona?

54:55.800 --> 54:58.553
What do you want here, Kynaston?

54:58.600 --> 55:00.033
I want my pillow.

55:00.080 --> 55:04.358
It seems to be lost. I was wondering
if Mrs Hughes might know where it is.

55:04.400 --> 55:06.436
This is intolerable!

55:06.480 --> 55:10.029
Sir Charles, gentlemen, could you leave
Mr Kynaston and me for a moment?

55:10.080 --> 55:11.149
Certainly.

55:13.320 --> 55:16.437
You know, Mr K, the performance
of yours I always liked best?

55:16.480 --> 55:19.756
As much as I adored
your Desdemona and your Juliet,

55:19.800 --> 55:22.633
I always loved best the "britches" parts.

55:22.680 --> 55:24.750
Rosalind, for instance.

55:24.800 --> 55:29.078
And not just because of the woman stuff,
but also because of the man sections.

55:29.120 --> 55:33.989
Your performance of the man stuff
seemed so right, so... true.

55:34.760 --> 55:37.718
I suppose I felt
it was the most real in the play.

55:37.760 --> 55:40.593
You know why the man stuff seemed so real?

55:40.640 --> 55:42.392
Because I'm pretending.

55:42.440 --> 55:45.716
You see a man through the mirror
of a woman through the mirror of a man.

55:45.760 --> 55:48.194
You take one reflecting glass away,
it doesn't work.

55:48.240 --> 55:51.471
The man only works because you see
him in contrast to the woman he is.

55:51.520 --> 55:54.398
If you saw him
without the her he lives inside,

55:54.440 --> 55:56.431
he wouldn't seem a man at all.

56:01.120 --> 56:03.953
Yes, you've obviously thought
longer on this question than I.

56:15.840 --> 56:17.398
I heard about your...

56:17.440 --> 56:19.431
Yes, yes, I imagined you heard.

56:19.480 --> 56:21.550
I imagined you might have
more than heard.

56:21.600 --> 56:23.989
Perhaps you even heard
before it happened.

56:26.280 --> 56:28.077
I do not have your pillow.

56:28.160 --> 56:30.993
Well, you could have said that
in front of them.

56:31.040 --> 56:33.156
I have taken nothing
that belonged to you!

56:33.200 --> 56:36.715
You wear my clothes, play my parts,
live my life and you've taken nothing?

56:36.760 --> 56:38.557
Woman's perspective.

56:38.600 --> 56:41.831
But at least a recognisable one.
That pillow was my own.

56:41.880 --> 56:43.916
It was given to me some time back, as you know.

56:43.960 --> 56:47.077
Yes, a dresser always knows
a gentleman's secrets.

56:47.120 --> 56:49.793
Of course, I have my own dresser now.

56:49.840 --> 56:52.274
He's a man. He used to be an actor.

56:52.320 --> 56:54.595
I don't suppose you'd guess wnat type?

56:56.720 --> 56:59.518
You know, madam, I am amazed
you have need of an audience!

56:59.560 --> 57:03.155
With such self-regard as you display,
what room is left for the public's love?

57:03.200 --> 57:05.839
What do you know of love, sir?

57:05.880 --> 57:07.074
Or loyalty?

57:07.120 --> 57:10.715
Or adoration suffered
in deepest silence?

57:15.240 --> 57:18.357
The only love you know, sir,
is what you act on stage.

57:25.400 --> 57:28.870
The difference between man and man...

57:28.920 --> 57:30.717
Wilt thou be gone...

57:32.160 --> 57:34.196
It was the nightingale and not the lark,

57:34.240 --> 57:36.390
That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear...

57:36.440 --> 57:38.556
Oh, look, it's Kynaston!

57:54.040 --> 57:56.315
O, you are men of stone.

58:00.280 --> 58:02.669
O, you are men of stone.

58:04.080 --> 58:05.399
Lear.

58:07.760 --> 58:09.671
How did you guess?

58:09.720 --> 58:12.951
Cordelia. You're practising the carry.

58:16.160 --> 58:17.149
Light?

58:17.200 --> 58:19.111
Lighter than you.

58:19.160 --> 58:20.957
That work in performance?

58:21.000 --> 58:23.116
In performance, I carry a real woman.

58:23.160 --> 58:26.516
A former seamstress from Sheffield
twice my size.

58:26.560 --> 58:29.313
So, what do you want?

58:29.360 --> 58:32.113
Er, I want another go at the death scene.

58:32.160 --> 58:34.913
Can't. The Crown
would close me down if I did.

58:34.960 --> 58:37.679
- Tommy...
- You cost me the Palace's support.

58:37.720 --> 58:39.233
You refused to act with women

58:39.280 --> 58:43.432
on the day the King's mistress,
a mistress desirous of a career on stage,

58:43.480 --> 58:44.754
was watching.

58:44.800 --> 58:47.314
Besides, the company's full up.

58:47.360 --> 58:50.989
You weren't the only actor
cut loose by the law.

58:51.040 --> 58:53.315
The town's full of your sort now.

58:53.360 --> 58:55.396
Mr Betterton.

58:55.440 --> 58:57.874
Time to see the Gonerils.

58:59.040 --> 59:00.519
Happy days

59:06.160 --> 59:08.071
Tommy, is she...?

59:10.240 --> 59:11.878
Is she good?

59:11.920 --> 59:13.319
The Hughes?

59:13.360 --> 59:15.271
As an actress?

59:21.560 --> 59:23.471
She's a star.

59:25.440 --> 59:27.351
She did what she did first.

59:28.120 --> 59:30.588
You did what you did last.

59:57.080 --> 59:59.036
Good God.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.798
- You'll poach in that.
- Would Your Grace like me to disrobe?

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:05.149
Quiet. This isn't the place.

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:07.111
I thought you hated heat and steam.

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:09.469
I'm purifying myself.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:15.836
Why didn't you come to my rooms
when you heard I'd been attacked?

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:20.232
I knew you wouldn't want me
to see what they'd done to you.

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:22.077
Why didn't you write?

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:24.031
Ned, I've never been a word type

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:25.991
Letters are dangerous.

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:29.157
They live on
long after their passions have died.

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:31.191
They're dangerous only if they're secret.

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:33.196
I'd call us a secret, wouldn't you?

01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:36.191
There were beginning to be whispers.

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.800
Those things you said at the Palace.
I warned you, Ned.

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:42.469
What shall I do to win my lord again?

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:43.589
Don't.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.551
I'm getting married.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.591
Jane Bellamy. You met her, I believe?

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:49.756
It's this Saturday. The King's coming.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:52.431
Dryden's composed a sonnet.

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:55.396
Jane's quite a charming thing, really.

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.556
Pretty, rich.

01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:59.397
Surprisingly literate.

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:00.953
And a woman.

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:05.275
What's she like in bed?

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:07.276
What's she like...

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.594
to kiss?

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.950
Does she wear a golden flow
as you die in her? Or don't you know?

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:14.556
I don't want you!

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:18.191
Not as you are now

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.519
I...

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:25.352
When I did spend time with you,

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:29.359
I... always thought of you as a woman.

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:32.910
When we were in bed,

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:35.190
it was always in a bed on stage.

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.754
I'd think, "Here I am, in a play...

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:41.471
...inside Desdemona. "

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.193
Cleopatra, poor Ophelia...

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:48.750
You're none of them now.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.951
I don't know who you are.

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:56.351
<i>I doubt you do.</i>

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:56.270
Kind sir, would point thy dagger
at this comely thicket, my lady...

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.913
Kind sir, would point thy dagger
at this comely thicket, my lady...

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:03.758
Madam, beg your pardon,
I'm looking for Miss Nell Gwynn.

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:07.110
You won't find her here.
She's in the wings about to make her entrance.

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:11.951
- Kind sir, would point thy dagger...
- Sir?

01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:17.510
Do forgive. We're about to perform
one of our Palace musicales.

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:21.593
Sir, the guests?

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:27.313
- You look familiar.
- Sir, I am Edward Kynaston.

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:29.874
Kynaston! How in hell did you get in here?

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:33.276
A former fellow actor is your undercook
and has long been dear a friend to me.

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:35.675
Then we'll have to execute him.

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:38.073
Joke, joke.

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:40.429
Calm down, Kynaston.

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:42.357
What do you want with Nell, anyway?

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:44.038
Nell doesn't like you very much.

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:47.072
When she came to Mr Betterton's theatre,
my bile was aimed at another.

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.998
- I did not even see Miss Gwynn.
- I'm sure you can straighten it out.

01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:53.151
But it's just not important to me.

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.519
It is to me!

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:56.755
Charlie, what's holding things up?

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:14.997
Say what you want.

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:27.591
I want to act.

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:29.596
Then act.

01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:32.393
I want to act as I did before.

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:34.078
- The girls' parts?
- If you will.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:39.194
I won't. Balance the scales, Kynaston,
give the girls a chance.

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:41.196
Besides...

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.435
it's a sop to the Church.

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:46.790
Priests always preach
about boys playing women.

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:50.435
They say it leads
to effeminacy and sodomy.

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:52.232
Well, they'd know, they're priests.

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:54.669
Act a man, Kynaston.

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:56.438
How hard could it be?

01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:59.711
It is not a question of acting a man.

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:02.433
I can act a man.

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:05.278
There's no artistry in that.

01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:09.279
There are things that I can be
as a woman that I cannot be as a man.

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:11.390
- Such as?
A star.

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:15.592
No, I think Mr Kynaston could be
a star in any guise.

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:18.359
If indeed there is no artistry
in acting a man,

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:19.913
then show us.

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:24.632
Be a man for us and perhaps
His Majesty will change his mind

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:26.352
as to whether you can play a woman.

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:29.312
Yes, perform a soliloquy

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:33.239
that displays all that is bold and strong

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:36.317
and masculine in a man.

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:39.271
Let's see you as...

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:42.197
...Othello.

01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:11.351
It is the cause...

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:17.792
It is the cause, my soul,

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:22.877
Let me not name it to you,

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:25.193
you chaste st...

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:29.913
May I start again?

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:32.793
- Oh, yes, yes, by all means.
Thank you.

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:41.870
It is the cause.

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.111
It is the cause, my soul,

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:48.913
Let me not name it to you

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:50.712
you chaste stars!

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:52.671
It is the cause.

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:55.277
Yet I'll not shed her blood;

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:01.479
Nor scar that whiter skin of hers
than snow...

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.874
Sorry, may I... once more?

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:11.389
Please.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:20.191
Yet she must die,
else she'll betray more men.

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:23.312
Put out the light, then put out the light!

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:25.555
Oh!

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:31.715
Oh!

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:36.355
Oh...

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:41.993
Oh!

01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:45.351
Oh...

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:48.351
Oh...

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:51.992
Oh...

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:55.348
If...

01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:59.398
...I could... could give it...

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.351
one more go.

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:04.759
I...

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:11.955
Well, well, show to do. Come on.

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:13.359
Kynaston!

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:16.590
My astronomers tell me

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:20.679
the star's light shines on
long after it has died.

01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:27.272
Even though it doesn't know it.

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:41.156
Exile is a dreadful thing

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.997
for one who knows his rightful place.

01:08:48.439 --> 01:08:50.395
Shall we, sir?

01:08:50.439 --> 01:08:52.158
We shall, madam.

01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:56.109
I'm not staying.

01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:58.071
- It's by Royal command.
- Stay without me!

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:02.071
Mr Kynaston!

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:04.711
Mr Kynaston!

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:07.553
Mr Kynaston!

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:17.031
- There's an handsome lad!
- Bet you like a lady, don't you?

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:19.071
The difficulty as I see it is that...

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:22.157
Well, a theatregoer these days
has so many choices.

01:09:23.279 --> 01:09:26.078
There's Mrs Corbett doing Romeo And Juliet,

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.111
Mrs Bracegirdle in Twelfth Night,

01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:31.276
Mrs Barry in Hamlet.

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:33.309
And you...

01:09:33.359 --> 01:09:35.430
you, of course, in Lear.

01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:40.189
The house was half-full today at best.

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:42.154
Well...

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:45.037
Summer, you know.

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:49.830
Will you be here for the second performance?

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.831
I fear not, Mrs Hughes.

01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:56.872
Going off to see one of my rivals?

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:00.711
You have no rivals, Mrs Hughes.

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:11.636
Mr Pepys.

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:15.910
Who do you write all those little notes for?

01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:17.837
For myself alone.

01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:21.389
Do you enjoy it?

01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:23.351
I love it.

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:26.151
Don't you love acting?

01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:33.468
Yes.

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:39.959
But unfortunately,
I cannot do it for myself alone.

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.831
For I fear...

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:47.716
...in truth, I'm terrible at it.

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:48.954
Oh, now!

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.673
Now, my dear Mrs Hughes!

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:53.631
You are too harsh on yourself.

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:59.190
You made your debut
as the first actress on the English stage.

01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:05.593
Mr Pepys...

01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:08.951
...when I made my debut,

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:13.869
was I a good actress?

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:18.871
Mrs Hughes...

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:22.111
...there was no comparison.

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:30.357
- Mr Cockerell.
- Mrs Hughes.

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:32.311
Thought I'd pop in and see the show.

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:35.670
Light house today. Oh, Mrs Hughes?

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:37.631
Do you know Mrs Barry?

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:43.431
I have heard so much
about you, Mrs Hughes.

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:47.439
<i>I would so like some day
to see your Ophelia.</i>

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:50.552
Well, let's have a cordial
after the show, eh?

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:52.875
I want to talk about some changes.

01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:07.599
Mr Pepys
Yes?

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:11.790
Do you know the whereabouts of Mr Kynaston?

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:18.596
# Oh, mother, oh, mother

01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:21.154
# Oh, what shall I do?

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:22.633
Ooooh...

01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:24.989
# I've married a man

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:27.600
# Who's unable to screw

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.956
# My troubles are many

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.639
# My pleasures are small

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.150
# For I've married a man

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:40.351
# Who has no balls at all

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.436
# No balls

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:45.074
# No balls at all

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:49.079
# Married a man who has no balls at...

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:50.314
# No balls at...

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:52.999
# No balls at all!

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:57.517
That was top-hole!

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:01.920
And speaking of hole...

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:07.351
...it is my understanding,

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:11.188
- having circled the room as t'were...
Wahay!

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:14.232
...that there are some of you gents...

01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:16.032
Who, us?

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:18.958
...and maybe even some ladies out there...

01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:25.071
- You can rub my pole any time!
... what think our little pretty one here

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:29.716
is not actually what we call
"a complete female stage beauty"

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:33.712
or even a real, live...

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:34.749
fish!

01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:37.635
Well...

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:39.159
we got the proof.

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:40.838
Show us the proof!

01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:42.996
Right here!

01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:44.678
Ha, ha, ha!

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:47.473
- Come on!
- Up further!

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:50.117
Missy, dear...

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:52.754
raise the curtain, will you, please?

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:54.791
Up, up, up...

01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:58.597
Higher!

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:11.272
Stop it!

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:14.151
Stop it!

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:18.034
What do you want, trout?

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:20.799
- I want the lady!
- After we've finished.

01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:23.835
I'll give you five pounds!

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:25.791
Take the money!

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:30.035
Now get the fuck off my stage!

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:34.235
She's still got your merkin!

01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:36.840
And give me back my merkin!

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.231
You've slept.

01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:14.597
You can stay here the week.
I paid the inkeeper that far.

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:16.551
Have you eaten?

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:19.429
No.

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:23.840
We'll get food and drink in you.

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:27.231
And no spirits.

01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:43.151
Why are you doing this?

01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:06.991
Why won't you play men?

01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:15.714
Men aren't beautiful.
What they do isn't beautiful, either.

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:18.433
Women do everything beautifully,

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:20.391
especially when they die.

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:23.352
Men feel far too much.

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:25.868
Feeling ruins the effect.

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:29.913
Feeling makes it ugly.

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:39.512
Perhaps that's why I could never pull off
the death scene.

01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:42.319
I...

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:46.757
...could never feel it...

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:48.711
in a way that...

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:53.512
...wouldn't mar the...

01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:03.191
I couldn't let the beauty die.

01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:09.754
Without beauty, there's nothing.

01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:14.951
Who could love that?

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:37.271
I'll stay with you while you sleep.

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.991
Want to make sure I don't run off?

01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:44.679
No.

01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:52.031
I've never slept with a man before.

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:55.231
And I've never slept with a woman...

01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:57.191
except myself.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.319
Never?

01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:02.071
Never slept.

01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:25.951
What do men do?

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:31.113
With women?

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:33.071
With men.

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:40.074
They...

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:42.795
We...

01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:48.798
Well, it depends.

01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:50.637
On?

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.516
On who's the man
and who's the woman.

01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:58.949
- But I said men with men.
- Yes, yes, I know, but with, er...

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:02.754
...men and women,
there's a man and there's a woman,

01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:04.916
and my experience has been

01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:07.918
that it's the same with men and men.

01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:12.320
- Were you the man or the woman?
- I was the woman.

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:16.951
That means?

01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:23.074
Er, it...

01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:28.357
...um, in the saddle.

01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:31.312
- So, am I the man now or the woman?
- You're the man.

01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:33.271
- And you're the woman?
- Yes.

01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:37.671
- There isn't much to do.
- Not with what we're given.

01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:39.631
So, who am I now?

01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:41.716
Er, you're the man...

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:43.398
Er, you're the woman!

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:45.476
And you're...?

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:48.512
I'm the man. Or so I assume.
Seldom get up here. Quite a view.

01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:51.910
But I'm... I'm the man-woman?

01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:55.350
Yes... you're the man-woman.

01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:58.159
And what am I now?

01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:01.113
I...

01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:04.151
You're the woman.

01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:06.111
- Still?
- Yes.

01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:17.991
And now what am I?

01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:20.194
The woman.

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:24.991
- And now?
- The woman.

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:27.518
And you are?

01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:29.471
The man.

01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:42.357
- Tell me something.
- Anything!

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:44.311
How do you die?

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:47.111
- What?
- As Desdemona.

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:49.196
How do you die?

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:52.358
Oh, no, I'm sorry...

01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:54.311
I wanted...

01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:02.429
Your old tutor did you a great disservice,
Mr Kynaston.

01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:06.758
He taught you how to speak and swoon
and toss your head,

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:09.837
but he never taught you
to suffer like a woman

01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:11.791
or love like a woman.

01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:18.511
He trapped a man in woman's form
and left you there to die!

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:24.436
I always hated you as Desdemona.

01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:25.959
You never fought!

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.355
You just died beautifully!

01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:36.998
No... no woman would die like that,
no matter how much she loved him!

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:39.713
A woman would fight!

01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:51.069
I need a Desdemona!

01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:52.075
What?

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:55.590
"Sheffield's Gift to the Theatre" has
returned to her mother's to have a baby!

01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:58.597
A baby?

01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:01.475
Well, that didn't happen in the old days, did it?

01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:03.431
It's a catastrophe!

01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:05.596
The Palace is reconsidering its patronage,

01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:08.473
the King is coming to see the show tonight

01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:10.590
and I need a Desdemona by eight o'clock.

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:11.868
Right, who's available?

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:16.038
There is only one actress in London
I'm aware of who knows the part,

01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:18.913
and is currently between bookings.

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:20.359
I won't do it!

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:23.198
But didn't you hear him? It's for the King!

01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:25.993
- But I'm no good.
- Well, that never stopped you before.

01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:29.953
My dear, the King comes tonight
to decide whether to patronise my theatre again.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.391
If we put him off, he'll know something's up!
You must play, Mrs Hughes!

01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:39.709
What do you intend to do about this?

01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:57.516
I can't play Desdemona.

01:23:57.560 --> 01:23:59.471
I never could.

01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:05.831
I don't know how to act.

01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:13.673
Where is he?

01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:16.188
If you could just take her in hand.

01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:18.356
Teach her some tricks and turns.

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:21.915
Most of the play she'll get by,
it's the end that's bad.

01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:23.154
When she dies.

01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:26.395
She... she's no good!

01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:27.998
I say this as a friend.

01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:31.350
Mr Kynaston, have you ever seen
Mrs Hughes on the stage?

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:33.072
I saw her audition, that was enough.

01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:34.633
Why? What's she like?

01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:35.829
You.

01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:37.552
She does you.

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:41.878
Every inflection, every bat of the eye,
bits of business, vocal tricks...

01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:45.276
- Then she shouldn't be half-bad.
- But it doesn't work!

01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:49.754
Forgive me.

01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:51.711
I have spoken loudly.

01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:55.476
Did she send you here?

01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:57.670
No one knows we've come

01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:04.071
<i>What do you offer me...</i>

01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:07.151
...pretty, witty Nell?

01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:11.155
A friend.

01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:13.077
Friends I've had. Give me an audience.

01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:16.669
If that's what you want,
you must take it with your own hands.

01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:20.508
A man isn't how he walks or how he speaks.

01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:22.391
It's what he does.

01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:31.315
Well?

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:33.271
What's your answer?

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:03.838
- Gentlemen!
- We have procured a tutor!

01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:04.835
Oh!

01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:06.438
- Ned.
- Tommy.

01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:08.152
Kynaston!

01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:11.794
- Some rules of engagement...
- First rule, you're out.

01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:14.638
Betterton!

01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:17.114
No, no, no, no.
Best work in private, Sir Charles.

01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:22.675
We shall exeunt, Kynaston,

01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:25.632
but mark our history and my property.

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:28.433
<i>You are assisting my Desdemona.</i>

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:30.357
Don't try anything funny.

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:33.476
If you give her a funny voice

01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:35.158
or a funny walk,

01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:36.519
a squint,

01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:38.118
I'll notice.

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:40.515
And I won't like it.

01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:42.676
A critic is born.

01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:46.156
And all because I thought you were
a whore and grabbed your cock!

01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:54.034
Now, is there anything you want?
Some wine, some cheese?

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:56.355
- A share.
- Oh, ho, ho!

01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:59.472
Now, I would say, "What?"
And you will say?

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:00.873
- "A share. "
- How much?

01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:02.638
- Five.
- Thief.

01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:06.999
- Shall I fetch her, Mr Kynaston?
- Would you be a dear?

01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:32.831
Mr Kynaston.

01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:43.791
Mrs Hughes.

01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:52.593
Let's get to work, shall we?

01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:53.959
Er, yes.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.719
Are you wearing that tonight?

01:27:56.760 --> 01:27:58.557
Yes
No, youre not

01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:02.232
- Sir Charles designed this costume.
- It looks it.

01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:04.589
- You'll strip down to your shift.
- Strip?

01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:06.631
You can't teach me how to be a woman!

01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:09.752
I'm not teaching you how to be a woman,
but how to be Desdemona.

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:13.110
I don't want to be Desdemona.
I don't want to act ever again.

01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:16.596
No! You claimed the role. Hold onto it
till they pry your fingers from its neck.

01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:20.394
And you hold this theatre in your hands.
So stand still, dry your eyes and strip!

01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:22.431
Muss your hair before the scene.

01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:25.074
Not like that, that's puffing it
to make it look attractive.

01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:28.032
No, no, no, no lip paint. White cheeks.

01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:30.958
Pale lips. Blood drains down with sleep,
not up to the face.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:36.028
Now, the way Betterton does the last scene,
there are 32 lines, cutting 17.

01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:40.877
You're the woman, I'm the man.
Start on the bed.

01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:44.071
Not like that! That's like me.

01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:47.598
Is that how you sleep?

01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:52.513
How am I supposed to know how I sleep?
I'm sleeping while I sleep!

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:54.437
Don't act with what isn't there!

01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:57.517
The man's been a festering boil

01:28:57.560 --> 01:28:59.676
- for three fucking hours, hasn't he?
- Yes.

01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:02.632
He's come to your room, woke you
and told you to pray before you die.

01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:04.716
- So, what's the line?
- Talk you of killing?

01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:05.988
Ay, I do.

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:09.157
- Then heaven have mercy on me!
- Good girl. Keep going.

01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:10.758
They are loves I bear to you.

01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:13.271
Peace, and be still!

01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:14.912
And I mean that.

01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:16.791
But Othello is advancing on her.

01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:17.829
Am I?

01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:21.190
You see me moving?
You take two steps back on the first line,

01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:22.832
then stumble on the last line.

01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:24.359
I can't remember the stumble.

01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:26.311
Peace, and be still!

01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:28.874
By my life and soul,
send for the man and ask him.

01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:31.070
"Send for the man and ask him. "

01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:33.634
Easy to say, isn't it?
"Send for the man and ask him. "

01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:35.432
Cassio's name gives her the willies.

01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:37.596
- But she doesn't say the name "Cassio".
- Aha!

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.194
I'm lost.

01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:43.152
If lago wanted to poison the Moor's mind
with a lover for Desdemona,

01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:45.316
he had to pick someone who made sense.

01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:47.828
It couldn't be... Jo-Jo the Mute Boy.

01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:52.112
lago picked Cassio because, in truth,
Desdemona does fancy him.

01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:56.995
So, when Othello mentions him,
she must say, "Yes, call for Cassio. "

01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:59.634
But his name doesn't come easily.

01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:02.069
But she doesn't say his name!

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.433
Yes.

01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:07.995
- This next exchange of lines comes fast.
- Why?

01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:10.600
We want to get to the murder
faster than they expect.

01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:13.234
How can I say things like,
"While I say one prayer," fast?

01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:16.192
No, you're not in charge
of this part of the scene, the Moor is.

01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:19.471
The Moor says his lines fast. You have
to slap your words in as fast as you can.

01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:22.273
- Go.
- Alas, he is betray'd, and I undone!

01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:24.197
Out, strumpet!
Weep'st thou for him to my face?

01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:26.151
O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!

01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:28.031
- Down, strumpet!
- Kill me tomorrow!

01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:29.479
- Nay, if you strive...
- But half an hour!

01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:31.750
- Being done, there is no pause.
- But while I say one prayer!

01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:33.199
It is too late.

01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:40.830
See what comes out of rehearsal?

01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:47.879
- I had planned to scream anyway.
- Good for you.

01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:49.638
Throw me on the bed, kill me.

01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:51.557
- No.
- We have to finish this off.

01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:53.670
Save something for the moment.

01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:57.872
Always do something different than you
planned. Good to throw yourself a bit.

01:30:57.920 --> 01:30:59.956
Recall what we've done to this point.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.911
Then when you die...

01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:05.719
...surprise me.

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:09.955
But how do I know
Mr Betterton will do as you have done?

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.991
You don't. Because he won't.

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:21.354
- Right, ready to go?
- Yes. I'm playing the Moor.

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:24.511
- I beg your pardon?
- Mrs Hughes insists.

01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:26.630
- Mrs Hughes?
- I do.

01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:28.477
But does he even know the part?

01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:31.592
- Yes, he knows it.
- Right, now I'll need bootblack.

01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:33.790
- I have bootblack.
- With you?

01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:36.149
A scuff, sir, is a dreadful thing.

01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:38.589
Now, out, all of you.

01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:56.908
Mr Kynaston.

01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:58.632
My thanks.

01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:10.191
It's not a good part, Desdemona.

01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:11.753
Go for Cleopatra.

01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:13.392
Cleopatra?

01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:15.237
She kills herself with the sting of an asp.

01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:19.273
"Those who do die, do never recover. "

01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:22.631
"I blame you for my death. "

01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:33.033
What's that from?

01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:38.069
See you on stage.

01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:52.391
It is the cause.

01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:59.518
It is the cause, my soul,

01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:06.590
Let me not name it to you,
you chaste stars!

01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:11.915
It is the cause.

01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:23.075
Who's there? Othello?

01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:24.712
Ay, Desdemona.

01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:27.320
Will you come to bed, my lord?

01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:29.351
Have you pray'd tonight, Desdemona?

01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:30.992
Ay, my lord.

01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:32.996
If you bethink yourself of any crime

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:36.112
Unreconcil'd as yet to heaven and grace,
Solicit for it straight.

01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:38.116
Alas, my lord,
what may you mean by that?

01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:40.071
Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by:

01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:42.429
I would not kill thy unprepared spirit;

01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:44.994
No, heaven forfend!
I would not kill thy soul.

01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:47.439
Talk you of killing?

01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:48.833
Ay, I do.

01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:51.394
- Then heaven have mercy on me!
- Think on thy sins.

01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:55.797
- They are loves I bear to you.
- Ay, and for that thou diest.

01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:01.991
That death's unnatural that kills for loving.

01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:05.476
Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?

01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:08.512
Some bloody passion
shakes your very frame:

01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:10.912
These are portents; but yet I hope,

01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:13.030
I... I hope they do not point on...

01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:15.350
Peace, and be still!

01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:21.679
I will... I will so.

01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:33.474
What's the matter?

01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:39.711
That handkerchief...

01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:44.356
...which I so lov'd and gave thee.

01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:46.759
Thou gav'st to Cassio.

01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:51.078
No, by my life and soul!
Send for Ca... the man and ask him.

01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:52.838
His mouth is stopp'd;

01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:55.235
Honest lago hath ta'en order for't.

01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:58.113
Alas, he is betray'd,

01:34:58.160 --> 01:34:59.957
and I undone!

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:01.877
Out, strumpet!

01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:04.718
Weep'st thou for him to my face?

01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:07.274
O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!

01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:09.038
Down, strumpet!

01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:10.354
Kill me tomorrow;

01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:11.674
let me live tonight!

01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:13.790
Nay, if you strive...

01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:16.400
- But half an hour!
- Being done, there is no pause.

01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:18.630
But while I say one prayer!

01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:21.478
It is too... late.

01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:22.635
No!

01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:29.670
Put out the light!

01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:33.958
Help!

01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:37.835
Help!

01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:40.509
He's killing...

01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:41.959
He's killing me!

01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:08.796
What noise is this?

01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:13.711
Not dead?

01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:17.151
Not quite yet dead?

01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:22.755
I that am cruel am yet merciful;

01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:25.716
I will not let thee linger in thy pain:

01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:30.509
So...

01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:34.799
So.

01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:01.715
O, my good lord, yonder's foul murder...

01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:23.392
Oh!

01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:24.668
Falsely...

01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:27.518
...falsely murder'd!

01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:30.711
Alas! Alas!

01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:32.715
Alas...

01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:36.391
...what cry is that?

01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:38.351
Sweet mistress, speak!

01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:41.751
Who hath done this deed?

01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:44.238
Nobody,

01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:46.759
I myself.

01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:50.318
Farewell:

01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:54.397
Commend me to my kind lord:

01:37:56.480 --> 01:37:59.552
O, farewell!

01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:15.231
Why,

01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:18.396
how should she be murder'd?

01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:19.873
Bugger!

01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:24.556
Brava! Brava!

01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:26.830
Brava!

01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:29.189
- Brava, Mrs Hughes!
- Brava!

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:33.797
Who knows?

01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:35.592
Bravo!

01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:37.437
Bravo, Mrs Hughes!

01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:41.918
Brava, Mrs Hughes!

01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:43.871
Brava! Brava!

01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:48.749
Mrs Hughes!

01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:51.796
Brava, Mrs Hughes!

01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:53.876
- Brava!
- Mrs Hughes!

01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:08.108
Brava!

01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:15.876
Hughes! Hughes!

01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:17.592
Brava!

01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:19.198
Very, very good.

01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:20.355
Brava!

01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:31.868
Brava!

01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:43.996
Please, we still have one more scene.

01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:46.754
Mrs Hughes!

01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:48.518
Mr Betterton!

01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:51.711
Surely that was the finest night
I've ever had in the theatre.

01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:53.034
What performances!

01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:56.390
- Mrs Hughes!
- Producer coming through, thank you.

01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:59.398
I do think I did the most extraordinary
performance of my life.

01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:06.155
Isn't it truly wonderful?
Marvellous, thank you.

01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:11.310
- Good show, Betterton! Ho, ho!
- Thank you.

01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:12.793
Thrills and chills.

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:15.559
That new ending - very, very real.

01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:16.999
Almost too much so.

01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:19.076
But restorative somehow.

01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:22.192
Well, that's tragedy for you.

01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:24.629
Awe and terror, and yet we still go to dinner.

01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:30.713
Where are Mrs Hughes and Mr Kynaston?

01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:33.149
You almost killed me!

01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:36.471
<i>I did kill you.</i>

01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:39.678
You just didn't die.

01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:45.397
Why didn't you finish me off?

01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:51.311
I finally got the death scene right.

01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:39.555
So...

01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:43.671
...who are you now?

01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:55.476
I don't know.

01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:01.511
I don't know.
