Alright, Harriet,
after last night's thrilling

01:24.851 --> 01:26.520
come from behind victory

01:26.553 --> 01:29.355
your season bowling average
is now..

01:31.257 --> 01:32.693
...one thirty five.

01:32.726 --> 01:34.661
I'm hot.
I'm totally hot.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.698
Oh, how am I doing, Larry?

01:37.731 --> 01:39.866
Alright, your average
has climbed to..

01:41.301 --> 01:42.536
...seventy nine.

01:43.570 --> 01:45.639
Seventy nine.

01:45.672 --> 01:47.874
And I haven't even peaked yet.

01:48.842 --> 01:50.443
Alright, and Calvin

01:50.476 --> 01:54.247
still has the league‐leading
bowling average of..

01:55.616 --> 01:56.617
...one ninety five.

01:56.650 --> 01:57.751
‐ 'Oh.'
‐ Ha ha ha.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.588
Alright, now.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.256
Nothing's gonna stop us.

02:03.289 --> 02:04.758
We're going
to that championship.

02:04.791 --> 02:05.826
And what are we gonna do?

02:05.859 --> 02:06.860
(in unison)
Win!

02:06.893 --> 02:08.461
‐ What are we gonna do?
‐ Win!

02:08.494 --> 02:09.795
We are going to.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.265
(in unison)
Win! Win! Win!

02:12.298 --> 02:13.499
(in unison)
Win! Win! Win!

02:13.534 --> 02:15.569
[all cheering]
Yes! Yes! Yes!

02:23.544 --> 02:25.612
This is fun!

02:25.646 --> 02:27.581
What are we doing?

02:29.215 --> 02:31.317
We are psyching up.

02:31.351 --> 02:33.754
(in unison)
Ugh!

02:33.787 --> 02:36.389
For the big bowling
championship.

02:36.422 --> 02:38.925
(in unison)
Ugh!

02:38.959 --> 02:40.460
Are you gonna come
and watch us play?

02:40.493 --> 02:42.963
Well, of course, I am.
Don't be ridiculous.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.632
‐ When is it?
‐ Tomorrow night.

02:45.666 --> 02:48.301
Oh, Wednesday is bad for me.
I have a doctor's appointment.

02:48.334 --> 02:50.336
Can we do it Tuesday?

02:50.370 --> 02:53.640
Balki, this is the championship,
not a dinner date.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.576
Oh.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.744
Well, I better get back
to work before Gorpley

02:57.778 --> 02:58.679
catches me standing around.

02:58.712 --> 02:59.646
‐ Oh, yeah. Me too.
‐ Alright, alright.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.382
Take care of that arm, huh.
Keep it warm.

03:02.415 --> 03:05.351
Keep it warm. Yes! Yes!

03:05.385 --> 03:06.620
Hoo!

03:08.522 --> 03:11.257
I can't wait to see Gorpley
when they hand me that trophy.

03:11.291 --> 03:14.227
He's been rubbing my face
in it for a year.

03:14.260 --> 03:15.929
Rubbing your face
with the trophy?

03:18.899 --> 03:20.801
Cousin, that could
damage your pores.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.383
Alright!

03:38.852 --> 03:42.288
See, I left two standings
now you..

03:42.322 --> 03:46.392
So, this is an
American Bowling Alley.

03:46.426 --> 03:49.796
It don't look like
any alley I've ever seen.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.998
Listen to me,
I really need to get

03:52.032 --> 03:53.634
a lot of practice in tonight.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.536
So, please, just sit down

03:55.569 --> 03:58.438
and don't touch anything.

03:58.471 --> 03:59.740
Cousin, I‐I don't
suppose you will like

03:59.773 --> 04:00.774
to teach me how to bowl.

04:00.807 --> 04:01.875
‐ No. No.
‐ Cousin‐‐

04:01.908 --> 04:03.443
Absolutely not, no, no.

04:03.476 --> 04:08.348
Balki, tomorrow is the most
important match of my life.

04:08.381 --> 04:09.916
I have to concentrate.

04:13.419 --> 04:14.888
‐ Oh, hi, guys.
‐ Oh, no, no.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.022
Don't say anything
to Cousin Larry

04:16.055 --> 04:17.791
he got to concentrate.

04:21.060 --> 04:22.663
Not now, Balki.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.865
‐ When I bowl. When..
‐ Oh, oh.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.502
But where's Calvin?
It's not like him to be late.

04:28.535 --> 04:29.870
Yeah, where is Calvin?

04:33.073 --> 04:35.576
Oh. Hi, guys.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.010
Hi, Mr. Gorpley.

04:37.043 --> 04:40.046
Appleton, so sorry to hear
about your bad luck.

04:41.748 --> 04:43.483
What bad luck?

04:43.517 --> 04:45.318
Oh, I guess,
you haven't heard.

04:45.351 --> 04:47.821
Gee, I hate to be
the bearer of bad news.

04:47.854 --> 04:49.756
What bad news?

04:49.790 --> 04:52.458
Well, it seems that
Calvin's boss

04:52.492 --> 04:55.696
sent him to a seminar
in Topeka for two weeks.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.497
I guess he's gonna
miss the match.

04:58.765 --> 05:00.567
Wait a minute, Mr. Gorpley.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.569
Aren't you Calvin's boss?

05:02.603 --> 05:03.770
Oh, so I am.

05:05.606 --> 05:07.574
Gorpley, this
is the lowest thing

05:07.608 --> 05:08.742
you have ever done.

05:08.775 --> 05:10.611
Oh, trust me, Appleton.
It's not even close.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.685
I don't believe that guy.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.854
He did it again.

05:20.887 --> 05:22.388
Last year he locked
Jimmy in men's room

05:22.422 --> 05:23.423
so he'd miss the big match.

05:23.456 --> 05:24.791
And‐and now this.

05:24.825 --> 05:27.093
Well, I'm too angry
to practice.

05:27.127 --> 05:28.862
I'm gonna go home
and burn dinner.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.999
I gotta go shopping.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.801
The only thing that gets
me out of the depression

05:34.835 --> 05:36.703
is buying on credit.

05:38.539 --> 05:39.706
Oh, cousin, I'm so sorry.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.407
I'm so sorry.

05:41.441 --> 05:45.145
Well, I'm not gonna let Gorpley
win without a fight.

05:45.178 --> 05:49.115
If I have to, I'll pick
up the slack myself.

05:49.149 --> 05:51.918
Well, cousin, if‐if you have
time to go pick up your slacks

05:51.952 --> 05:54.555
you have time
to teach me how to bowl.

05:54.588 --> 05:55.622
‐ No. Absolutely not.
‐ Come on, look‐‐

05:55.656 --> 05:56.990
Balki, no!

05:57.023 --> 05:59.125
Balki, why don't you
go get yourself a soda?

06:05.732 --> 06:06.800
[exhales sharply]

06:13.206 --> 06:14.941
Cousin..

06:20.013 --> 06:21.782
...I want to bowl.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.752
Okay, fine. Get a ball.

06:25.786 --> 06:26.920
Let's get this over with.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.426
Oh, this one's no good.
It's got holes in it.

06:35.128 --> 06:38.031
Balki, Balki..

06:38.064 --> 06:40.400
...the holes are what
you put your fingers in.

06:41.935 --> 06:44.104
Oh, that's..
It's supposed to have the holes!

06:44.137 --> 06:45.806
‐ Yes.
‐ Well, I'll be snookered!

06:45.839 --> 06:47.874
Yeah.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.776
I thought they left
that one out overnight

06:49.810 --> 06:51.444
and the ball weevils got it.

06:51.477 --> 06:53.146
You know, they love
to get in there.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.882
Balki, Balki, Balki.

06:57.618 --> 06:58.685
Watch me.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.756
Alright, now.

07:02.789 --> 07:03.957
‐ You stand here.
‐ Uh‐huh.

07:03.990 --> 07:06.527
Alright?

07:06.560 --> 07:08.929
Get relaxed
and comfortable, okay.

07:10.731 --> 07:13.700
Yeah. Bring the ball up
to eye level..

07:13.734 --> 07:15.836
‐ Huh.
‐ Line up your shot.

07:15.869 --> 07:19.005
And then when I'm..
Bad place to stand.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.907
Bad place to stand.

07:23.510 --> 07:26.112
Alright, then,
when everything comes together..

07:27.280 --> 07:29.550
...you start your stride.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.928
Cousin, you know what?

07:41.962 --> 07:44.464
This is just like
nok‐nok‐roll‐a‐rock.

07:48.034 --> 07:51.237
‐ Nok‐nok‐roll‐a‐rock?
‐ Exactly.

07:51.271 --> 07:53.874
It's the Myposian game
the whole family can play.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.943
First, you take a rock..

07:56.977 --> 07:59.245
Oh, but listen to me!
Listen to me.

07:59.279 --> 08:01.748
Just take a rock.
You don't just take a rock.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.049
Part of the skill..

08:03.083 --> 08:07.120
...is picking just,
just the right rock.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.756
Uh, you have to feel..

08:09.790 --> 08:12.492
...at one, with your rock.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.662
‐ And you get it‐‐
‐ Balki.

08:15.696 --> 08:18.899
I'm sure, nok‐nok‐roll‐a‐rock
is a real challenge in Mypos.

08:18.932 --> 08:21.668
But in America,
where we've already gone through

08:21.702 --> 08:23.036
the industrial revolution.

08:25.105 --> 08:28.174
Sports are a bit
more sophisticated.

08:28.208 --> 08:31.812
It takes years
to become a good bowler.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.548
Well, then let's get started!

08:36.850 --> 08:38.585
Alright, get a ball.
Get a ball.

08:43.756 --> 08:45.225
How am I doing so far?

08:47.027 --> 08:48.261
You seem to have
mastered that part.

08:48.294 --> 08:50.597
Well, I should say so.

08:58.204 --> 09:00.073
Well, maybe not.

09:00.106 --> 09:01.908
‐ Pull.
‐ Yeah.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.815
[grunts]

09:18.825 --> 09:21.361
[grunting]

09:21.394 --> 09:23.363
‐ Aah.
‐ There we go.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.898
There we go.

09:31.838 --> 09:33.306
Why don't you try this one?

09:33.339 --> 09:34.941
Huh?

09:35.776 --> 09:37.844
‐ Better?
‐ Yeah.

09:37.878 --> 09:38.979
‐ Better?
‐ Oh, yeah.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.380
Okay, yeah. You got it?

09:40.413 --> 09:41.615
‐ Yeah.
‐ You got it?

09:41.648 --> 09:42.248
‐ Yeah.
‐ Alright.

09:42.282 --> 09:43.750
Oh!

09:45.185 --> 09:48.221
‐ Now, stand here, alright?
‐ Yeah, yeah.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.824
Remember, what I told you
get relaxed and comfortable.

09:50.857 --> 09:52.959
Just relaxed and comfortable.

09:56.396 --> 09:57.931
Oh!

10:00.934 --> 10:01.968
Get up.

10:02.002 --> 10:03.937
Get up. Get up.
Get up!

10:11.678 --> 10:13.213
Alright, now..

10:13.246 --> 10:15.048
...bring the ball
up to eye level.

10:15.081 --> 10:16.917
Line up the shot.

10:20.153 --> 10:22.022
I can't see a thing.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.260
Lower the ball.

10:32.098 --> 10:34.134
‐ There it is.
‐ Hmm.

10:34.167 --> 10:35.869
Alright, now..

10:36.770 --> 10:38.639
...start your stride.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.078
No, no, no.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.253
‐ I was..
‐ Yes.

10:53.286 --> 10:56.022
Alright, start your stride,
okay?

10:56.056 --> 10:58.058
Step on the right foot

10:58.091 --> 11:00.827
the first step of a four‐step
delivery. Step on the left.

11:00.861 --> 11:02.963
As you step on the right,
swing the ball back

11:02.996 --> 11:04.731
step left, swing forward
and release.

11:15.308 --> 11:17.043
Cousin, I don't think
it's gonna make it.

11:19.479 --> 11:20.914
‐ That's enough for today.
‐ Shall I..

11:20.947 --> 11:21.515
Shall I give it a little kick?

11:21.548 --> 11:23.216
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

11:23.249 --> 11:25.451
I don't want you to suffer
from bowler's burnout

11:25.485 --> 11:26.887
on the very first day.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.729
Cousin, can I..
Look, look.

11:35.762 --> 11:37.297
Can I just,
can I just try one thing?

11:37.330 --> 11:40.166
I‐I want,
can I just try it my way?

11:40.200 --> 11:42.202
Can I just try it my way?

11:42.235 --> 11:45.939
Balki, if you wanna use some
of your Stone Age techniques..

11:47.207 --> 11:48.341
...go right ahead.

11:48.374 --> 11:49.943
Thank you. I will.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.882
Now first..

11:55.916 --> 11:58.384
...I have to find a ball

11:58.418 --> 12:00.286
that I'm at one with.

12:09.996 --> 12:10.931
Oh!

12:29.282 --> 12:32.452
Nok, nok, nok, nok, nok.

12:32.485 --> 12:34.087
[inhales]

12:34.120 --> 12:35.956
[screaming]

12:54.941 --> 12:57.410
(Lydia)
'Are you telling me
that Balki is a great bowler?'

12:57.443 --> 12:58.378
Yeah, I couldn't believe it.

12:58.411 --> 13:01.147
It was strike,
after strike, after strike.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.784
He bowled a 285
on his first game.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.453
Two eighty five?

13:07.487 --> 13:09.523
‐ 'Two eighty five.'
‐ In one game?

13:09.556 --> 13:11.391
That's a month's worth
of bowling for you.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.596
‐ Hi.
‐ Oh, hi.

13:15.629 --> 13:17.598
Hi, hi, hi, hi.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.132
‐ Larry, we miss anything?
‐ No, no.

13:19.165 --> 13:21.101
‐ We're just warming up.
‐ Where's Balki?

13:21.134 --> 13:22.468
Well, he should be here
any minute.

13:22.503 --> 13:24.137
He had to stop at the doctor's

13:24.170 --> 13:25.939
and, uh, then he's coming
straight here.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.841
I saved you these seats.

13:27.874 --> 13:29.510
‐ Oh, great. Thanks.
‐ Thanks.

13:29.543 --> 13:33.146
Appleton, let's get this show
on the road.

13:33.179 --> 13:36.016
Alright, keep your shirt on.
Not all of our team is here yet.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.551
Oh, who did you get
to replace Calvin?

13:37.584 --> 13:39.052
One of the babes
from the typing pool?

13:39.085 --> 13:40.053
[laughing]

13:41.154 --> 13:44.290
It so happens it's Balki.

13:44.324 --> 13:47.427
[laughing]
Bartokomous?

13:47.460 --> 13:50.130
Excuse me, uh, I have to go
get ready for our victory party.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.535
You won't be laughing so much

13:54.568 --> 13:56.369
when Balki gets here.

14:02.342 --> 14:06.246
Oh! Am I late?
Am I in the bowling alley?

14:09.049 --> 14:11.317
‐ Balki.
‐ Cousin?

14:11.351 --> 14:13.019
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.422
Balki, what's the matter
with you?

14:16.456 --> 14:17.591
‐ Harriette?
‐ Right here, baby.

14:17.624 --> 14:18.992
‐ Harriette, the..
‐ Right here.

14:19.025 --> 14:22.062
The eye doctor
put‐put drops in my eyes

14:22.095 --> 14:24.598
and I can't see a thing.

14:24.631 --> 14:27.901
Balki, you didn't tell me you
were going to the eye doctor.

14:27.934 --> 14:29.435
Well, I didn't think
it was important.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.273
I was wrong.

14:35.441 --> 14:37.210
I can't do it.

14:37.243 --> 14:39.513
I can't think of everything
he doesn't know.

14:39.546 --> 14:42.115
Come on, cousin. I can bowl.

14:42.148 --> 14:45.151
The doctor said that they would
clear up in just a few hours.

14:45.185 --> 14:48.021
And all I need to do is just
take a little practice shot.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.389
‐ Uh, okay?
‐ Alright.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.057
‐ Okay.
‐ Okay.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.165
[shrieking]

15:08.308 --> 15:10.511
Come on, Appleton.
Enough stalling.

15:10.544 --> 15:11.978
Let's get started.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.013
Well, just a minute.
Just a minute.

15:13.046 --> 15:14.214
Balki needs to warm up.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.282
He's‐he's gotta take
a few practice frames.

15:16.316 --> 15:17.584
[laughing]

15:19.219 --> 15:20.654
Alright, come on, Balki.
Let's get you a ball.

15:20.687 --> 15:23.089
‐ Okay
‐ Uh‐huh.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.190
Here?

15:25.759 --> 15:27.293
‐ Oh!
‐ Oh!

15:27.327 --> 15:28.562
Alright. Here we go,
here we go.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.631
Okay. Alright, alright, alright.

15:30.664 --> 15:31.732
‐ Now, can you see the pins?
‐ No.

15:31.765 --> 15:32.999
‐ Can you see the pins?
‐ No.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.000
‐ Can you see the pins?
‐ No.

15:34.034 --> 15:34.701
Okay, go.

15:44.244 --> 15:47.313
Nok, nok, nok, nok, nok.

15:47.347 --> 15:48.481
[inhales]

15:53.520 --> 15:54.955
[screaming]

15:56.389 --> 15:58.625
‐ Good luck, Balki.
‐ Thanks, Mary Anne.

15:58.659 --> 16:00.093
Balki, concentrate.

16:01.528 --> 16:02.629
[screaming]

16:02.663 --> 16:04.998
Balki, Balki, hold it, hold it.

16:05.031 --> 16:06.600
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.068
Hold it, hold it.

16:16.076 --> 16:18.011
[instrumental music]

16:19.145 --> 16:20.380
Yay! Yay! Ha!

16:25.385 --> 16:26.419
Yes!

16:27.554 --> 16:29.222
[screaming]

16:33.594 --> 16:35.061
[laughing]

16:53.213 --> 16:55.481
Appleton, give up.

16:55.516 --> 16:58.384
The Mypiot needs a strike
and a spare to win this thing.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.587
Face it. That trophy is mine.

17:00.621 --> 17:02.488
Not so fast, Gorpley.

17:02.523 --> 17:04.324
It ain't over till it's over.

17:07.861 --> 17:09.194
It's over.

17:13.398 --> 17:15.201
Cousin, I'm starting to see
a little better.

17:17.270 --> 17:20.272
Balki. Balki. Balki.

17:20.306 --> 17:21.141
[whistling]

17:24.210 --> 17:28.381
‐ Cousin, I think I can do this.
‐ You do?

17:28.414 --> 17:30.651
Yeah, I have a feeling about it.

17:30.684 --> 17:34.154
The same feeling I had at the
'81 Roll‐a‐Rock Fall Classic.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.357
We were down to our last rock

17:37.390 --> 17:39.526
and there were still
six gourds standing

17:39.560 --> 17:42.095
and everybody said
this is impossible

17:42.128 --> 17:45.465
but I knew if I dug deep

17:45.498 --> 17:48.301
deep down inside myself

17:48.334 --> 17:51.337
I could knock the goodies
out of those gourds.

17:51.371 --> 17:52.405
‐ And did you?
‐ Well, no.

17:52.438 --> 17:54.675
Oh, God!

17:54.708 --> 17:57.778
But it was a good feeling
anyway. A real good one.

17:57.811 --> 18:00.346
Okay, cousin, I'm ready.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.716
Just lead me to those balls.

18:06.687 --> 18:08.522
‐ Come on, come on.
‐ Come on, Balki, come on.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.757
Alright, I've lined you up.

18:10.791 --> 18:12.859
Now, just follow your nose.

18:25.205 --> 18:28.274
Nok, nok, nok, nok, nok.

18:29.576 --> 18:30.877
[screaming]

18:35.716 --> 18:37.483
[all cheering]

18:37.518 --> 18:39.285
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

18:39.319 --> 18:41.688
Alright, alright.
Now, now, alright.

18:43.824 --> 18:45.892
Okay.

18:45.926 --> 18:49.195
All we need is a spare
and the championship is ours.

18:49.229 --> 18:50.396
‐ Ah!
‐ Alright, wait here.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.166
‐ You know what to do.
‐ Yeah.

19:01.908 --> 19:03.577
‐ Nok, nok, nok, nok..
‐ Come on, baby.

19:03.610 --> 19:05.145
‐ Let's go, Balki!
‐ Come on.

19:06.747 --> 19:08.314
[screaming]

19:10.851 --> 19:12.152
(Larry)
'Yes! Yes!'

19:13.620 --> 19:15.455
Oh, no. No!

19:15.488 --> 19:17.357
(all)
Yes! Yes!

19:21.762 --> 19:23.630
Cousin, you're frowning.

19:25.231 --> 19:27.701
‐ What's wrong?
‐ There's two pins left.

19:27.734 --> 19:30.804
‐ Well, that's great.
‐ No, no, it's a 7‐10 split.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.439
It's‐it's the hardest split
in bowling to pick up.

19:33.473 --> 19:36.242
Oh, come on, cousin, one time
in, in Nok Nok Roll‐a‐Rock

19:36.276 --> 19:39.245
I had a deadly 58‐37 split.

19:40.581 --> 19:41.548
‐ And you made it?
‐ Well, no.

19:41.582 --> 19:43.650
Oh, God.

19:43.684 --> 19:45.752
‐ Nobody makes that.
‐ Oh, really.

19:45.786 --> 19:48.388
Why do you tell me
these stories?

19:48.421 --> 19:50.256
It's just a way
of dealing with anxiety.

19:52.358 --> 19:54.360
Alright, come here.
Come on, come on, come on.

19:54.394 --> 19:55.261
Alright.

19:57.631 --> 19:59.533
Come on.
Knock it out of the park.

20:01.267 --> 20:05.539
Now remember,
this is only a game.

20:05.572 --> 20:08.809
It's the most important game
of my life.

20:08.842 --> 20:11.211
But it's only a game.

20:13.013 --> 20:14.781
Not too much pressure.

20:27.628 --> 20:30.463
Nok, nok, nok, nok, nok.

20:31.732 --> 20:33.667
[instrumental music]

21:00.661 --> 21:02.629
[cheering and applauding]

21:24.117 --> 21:26.419
I can't wait to take it
to work tomorrow

21:26.452 --> 21:29.055
and rub Gorpley's face in it.

21:29.089 --> 21:33.459
Cousin, isn't that what
Mr. Gorpley used to do to you?

21:33.493 --> 21:35.762
He certainly did.

21:35.796 --> 21:38.765
And‐and‐and you hated it
when he did it, didn't you?

21:38.799 --> 21:43.003
I sure did, and now he's gonna
see what it feels like.

21:46.439 --> 21:49.375
This trophy is supposed to
represent your accomplishments

21:49.409 --> 21:51.344
not somebody else's misfortune.

21:56.650 --> 21:58.819
You're gonna take all the fun
out of winning this, aren't you?

21:58.852 --> 22:00.887
You're just gonna suck
all the fun right out of it.

22:00.921 --> 22:03.056
Okay, cousin,
cousin, cousin, look.

22:03.089 --> 22:05.859
Listen to me.
You're missing the point.

22:05.892 --> 22:08.428
The point of this trophy,
this trophy says

22:08.461 --> 22:10.997
that‐that your team was better
than Mr. Gorpley's.

22:11.031 --> 22:13.634
And not rubbing his face
on it means

22:13.667 --> 22:16.970
that you're a better winner
than he is.

22:17.003 --> 22:19.673
Mr. Gorpley probably feels
pretty awful right now.

22:19.706 --> 22:21.074
Oh, you know he does.

22:23.777 --> 22:25.045
Can I just call him up
to make sure?

22:25.078 --> 22:25.979
No.

22:30.917 --> 22:32.452
How about a nasty note
on his office door?

22:32.485 --> 22:34.655
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

22:37.524 --> 22:40.060
How about if I just drive by his
house and yell, "Loser, loser?"

22:40.093 --> 22:42.996
'Cause I need something,
I need something

22:43.029 --> 22:47.167
to call my own, a little
something to hang on to.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.402
‐ Just‐‐
‐ Alright, cousin.

22:49.435 --> 22:50.604
One phone call.

22:59.680 --> 23:00.981
[theme music]
