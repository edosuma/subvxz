00:15.783 --> 00:17.987
Ana?

00:17.989 --> 00:20.482
Ana Marcovic?

00:20.484 --> 00:22.415
You're here for
the hostel, right?

00:22.417 --> 00:24.185
We're supposed
to pick you up.

00:24.187 --> 00:26.154
I'm Tatiana, by the way.

00:26.156 --> 00:28.655
Let me take your bag.

00:28.657 --> 00:31.355
You can sit up front.

00:34.024 --> 00:36.187
(speaking Serbian)

00:38.989 --> 00:41.355
Yes. I just tired from flight.

00:41.357 --> 00:43.227
Oh, yeah, Serbia
is ten hours away.

00:43.229 --> 00:45.298
It's where I'm from, too.
Ah.

00:53.128 --> 00:54.589
What is this?

00:54.591 --> 00:57.289
Don't ask questions, Ana.

00:57.291 --> 00:59.287
(groans softly)

01:02.961 --> 01:05.663
(Ana crying)

01:12.801 --> 01:14.430
(elevator bell dings)

01:14.432 --> 01:16.228
Morning, Sid.
Hey, boss.

01:16.230 --> 01:18.668
Just want to run the numbers before the
Compstat meeting tomorrow.

01:18.670 --> 01:20.436
Okay. Morning, Baker.

01:20.438 --> 01:21.804
Morning, sir.
Sarah Grant is here.

01:21.806 --> 01:23.100
I told her she could wait

01:23.102 --> 01:24.539
in your office.

01:24.541 --> 01:28.069
Oh. Well, in that case, I'm
gonna need at least ten minutes.

01:28.071 --> 01:29.771
Hold my calls.

01:31.805 --> 01:33.236
Hey.

01:33.238 --> 01:35.278
Hi.

01:35.280 --> 01:37.141
(laughs)

01:37.143 --> 01:38.750
Ah.
Mm.

01:38.752 --> 01:42.413
I'm sorry for just
barging in like this.

01:42.415 --> 01:44.484
No, it's great.
You look great.

01:44.486 --> 01:45.883
Thank you.

01:45.885 --> 01:47.881
Sit down.

01:47.883 --> 01:49.321
Ah. Want some coffee?

01:49.323 --> 01:51.015
No, I'm fine, thank you.

01:51.017 --> 01:54.687
I got my best suit
pressed and ready.

01:54.689 --> 01:56.054
All right.

01:56.056 --> 01:58.292
You ready for your big day?

01:58.294 --> 01:59.323
Almost.

01:59.325 --> 02:02.057
Mm.
There's a piece missing.

02:02.059 --> 02:04.255
What's that?

02:06.223 --> 02:09.594
I've been wanting to ask
you this for a long time,

02:09.596 --> 02:12.327
but I haven't been
able to figure out how.

02:13.855 --> 02:17.754
You have always been
like a father to me.

02:21.596 --> 02:23.866
Would you walk me
down the aisle?

02:28.266 --> 02:30.535
I'd be honored.

02:30.537 --> 02:32.702
Thank you.

02:36.745 --> 02:40.278
There's something else.

02:42.478 --> 02:46.945
I got a letter from
prison yesterday.

02:46.947 --> 02:49.648
From him.

02:55.152 --> 02:57.053
You didn't open it?

02:57.055 --> 02:59.253
No.

03:00.087 --> 03:03.461
I was hoping that you would.

03:09.232 --> 03:12.070
(quiet chatter, laughter)

03:12.072 --> 03:13.567
HENRY:
You don't need that.

03:13.569 --> 03:14.870
Grandpa?

03:14.872 --> 03:17.038
Erin. Come in.

03:17.040 --> 03:20.001
Come in. I put your coats
for the winter coat drive

03:20.003 --> 03:21.839
in the mud room for you,
but have you got a minute?

03:21.841 --> 03:23.071
Yeah, sure.
I'd like

03:23.073 --> 03:25.175
to introduce you
to a friend.

03:25.177 --> 03:28.545
Sylvia Hayden, my
granddaughter, Erin.

03:29.619 --> 03:31.080
I've heard a lot about you.

03:31.082 --> 03:32.511
All good, I hope?

03:32.513 --> 03:34.046
Oh, more than good, honey.

03:34.048 --> 03:35.717
HENRY:
You're the first one

03:35.719 --> 03:36.918
to have the honor.

03:36.920 --> 03:38.790
I haven't even told
your father yet.

03:38.792 --> 03:40.821
I didn't want to
scare her off.

03:40.823 --> 03:42.452
Well, I can understand that.

03:42.454 --> 03:44.826
(laughs)
How did you two meet?

03:44.828 --> 03:46.625
In a book club.
Book club.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.055
(both laugh)
Yeah.

03:48.057 --> 03:51.624
We read <i> Up the Old Hotel</i>
by Joseph Mitchell, and, uh,

03:51.626 --> 03:53.496
your grandpa and
I started talking

03:53.498 --> 03:56.066
about the great
old New York haunts

03:56.068 --> 03:57.907
that have closed down.

03:57.909 --> 04:00.507
And so, we've been kind of
going on this informal tour

04:00.509 --> 04:02.673
of the places
that are still around, you know?

04:02.675 --> 04:03.673
He's been spoiling me

04:03.675 --> 04:05.208
rotten.
(laughter)

04:05.210 --> 04:07.112
That's a beautiful bracelet.

04:07.114 --> 04:09.111
Oh, thank you.

04:09.113 --> 04:11.216
Well, thank him.

04:11.218 --> 04:13.417
Only the best for my girl.

04:16.858 --> 04:18.825
Detectives.
Lieutenant.

04:18.827 --> 04:20.192
Hope you got
something juicy for me.

04:20.195 --> 04:21.857
It would really burn
Lieutenant Carver's ass

04:21.858 --> 04:24.103
if we took down a big case
while she was on vacation.

04:24.126 --> 04:24.862
We don't know

04:24.864 --> 04:29.166
exactly what we got, but this
911 call came in this morning.

04:29.168 --> 04:32.565
(Ana speaking Serbian
and crying)

04:32.567 --> 04:34.965
Please don't hurt me!

04:34.967 --> 04:36.932
Don't kill me!

04:36.934 --> 04:38.436
(static)

04:38.438 --> 04:40.372
Damn.

04:40.374 --> 04:41.509
It's an international exchange.

04:41.511 --> 04:43.279
We traced it back
to an Ana Marcovic

04:43.281 --> 04:44.647
and called her parents
in Serbia.

04:44.649 --> 04:47.385
Ana had flown into JFK
this morning and was supposed

04:47.387 --> 04:48.785
to stay somewhere called

04:48.787 --> 04:50.954
the Gotham Youth Hostel
in Times Square.

04:50.956 --> 04:52.122
We have a location?

04:52.124 --> 04:54.258
Yeah. Cyberspace.

04:54.260 --> 04:56.827
This hostel only exists online

04:56.829 --> 04:59.730
as a trap to lure
women to New York.

04:59.732 --> 05:01.729
Lieutenant, this is the fifth
Eastern European woman

05:01.731 --> 05:03.768
to disappear
on their way to this hostel

05:03.770 --> 05:04.936
in the last six months.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.104
No trace.

05:06.106 --> 05:07.703
You got any leads?

05:07.705 --> 05:09.777
Surveillance cameras?
Witnesses?

05:09.779 --> 05:11.345
Just the 911 call and the name.

05:11.347 --> 05:13.114
Look, we want to run with this.

05:13.116 --> 05:15.113
We don't have enough.

05:15.115 --> 05:17.480
I'm not wasting
my two best detectives.

05:17.482 --> 05:19.583
We want this one.

05:51.917 --> 05:53.813
Hey.
Hey. What's up?

05:53.815 --> 05:55.963
So, I ran that name through
the system for you.

05:55.987 --> 05:56.654
Yeah?

05:56.655 --> 05:58.357
I don't know how
to tell this,

05:58.359 --> 05:59.788
but Sylvia Hayden
is wanted for murder.

05:59.812 --> 06:00.887
What?!

06:00.888 --> 06:03.062
She killed her last three
husband's in cold blood.

06:03.064 --> 06:05.830
They call her the
“Grandpa Killer”"

06:05.832 --> 06:07.935
Really?

06:07.937 --> 06:09.967
Why would you
do that to me?

06:09.969 --> 06:11.270
How could I not?

06:11.272 --> 06:12.838
It's just so easy.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.471
Did you find anything?

06:14.473 --> 06:16.272
Well, it's kind of
interesting, actually.

06:16.274 --> 06:18.145
Seems that “Sylvia Hayden”
didn't exist,

06:18.147 --> 06:20.452
at least under that name,
until 2007.

06:20.454 --> 06:22.549
But there are plenty
of innocent explanations.

06:22.551 --> 06:24.158
She could've remarried,

06:24.160 --> 06:26.822
or just legally dropped
a former husband's name.

06:26.824 --> 06:29.230
That's all I can get
from a cursory look.

06:29.232 --> 06:31.263
How far do you want me
to take this?

06:31.265 --> 06:33.397
I don't know.
You think I'm just being crazy?

06:33.399 --> 06:35.997
I mean, if it was your
grandfather, what would you do?

06:35.999 --> 06:38.204
I don't have a grandfather,
but my grandmother raised me,

06:38.206 --> 06:40.131
and if I thought
someone was messing with her,

06:40.133 --> 06:43.138
I'd turn over every stone until
I knew damn sure she was safe.

06:44.074 --> 06:45.871
But I might be
a little crazy, too.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.534
Listen,

06:47.536 --> 06:48.637
get me fingerprints or DNA,

06:48.639 --> 06:50.710
and I can take this
to the next level.

06:50.712 --> 06:52.479
Just let me know
what you want.

06:52.481 --> 06:54.649
Okay.

06:56.785 --> 06:59.814
FRANK: That was nice
meeting Father Barnes.

06:59.816 --> 07:01.981
I think you're in good hands.

07:04.190 --> 07:07.121
So, uh...

07:07.123 --> 07:09.090
did you read the letter?

07:09.092 --> 07:11.291
(sighs)
Yeah, I did.

07:12.093 --> 07:14.090
But you are getting married

07:14.092 --> 07:16.097
in three days.

07:16.099 --> 07:17.632
There is no clock on this.

07:17.634 --> 07:19.461
He's not going anywhere.

07:19.463 --> 07:22.700
So, can we talk about
this in a couple of weeks?

07:22.702 --> 07:25.531
What did it say?

07:26.900 --> 07:28.730
Basically?
Mm-hmm.

07:28.732 --> 07:31.737
That he's sorry and claims
he found God in prison.

07:31.739 --> 07:33.936
The usual for a sociopath

07:33.938 --> 07:36.736
who's building a long
con for the parole board.

07:36.738 --> 07:38.575
So, he murdered my family,

07:38.577 --> 07:41.446
but God has forgiven him,
so I should, too?

07:41.448 --> 07:43.741
Is that what he wants?

07:46.117 --> 07:48.179
(sighs)

07:48.181 --> 07:51.020
There is a program called
Restorative Justice

07:51.022 --> 07:55.386
where the victim can meet
the offender face-to-face.

07:55.388 --> 07:58.322
He wants to meet me?

07:58.324 --> 08:00.825
I mean, you don't think

08:00.827 --> 08:02.791
that I should...

08:02.793 --> 08:04.823
consider this, do you?

08:04.825 --> 08:08.429
I read the letter,
as you asked me to,

08:08.431 --> 08:10.933
and I am passing on
what was offered.

08:10.935 --> 08:13.397
But no.

08:13.399 --> 08:15.366
Sarah,

08:15.368 --> 08:18.808
I do not think you
should take him up on it.

08:18.810 --> 08:22.410
I mean, the last time I saw
Donald Berry was in court.

08:22.412 --> 08:24.114
I was seven years old.

08:24.116 --> 08:26.282
And he told me
that his only regret was

08:26.284 --> 08:28.250
that he didn't kill me, too.

08:29.492 --> 08:31.458
Can you just tell the court,

08:31.460 --> 08:34.558
or the prison, or whoever
you need to inform

08:34.561 --> 08:37.390
that he better not
write me again?

08:37.393 --> 08:39.390
Can you do that?

08:39.392 --> 08:41.895
Yes, I can.

08:41.897 --> 08:44.102
Okay.

08:46.105 --> 08:48.733
Hey, what are you guys
doing here?

08:48.735 --> 08:50.102
Everything okay?

08:50.104 --> 08:53.777
Yeah, I just, uh, need to talk
to you for a second over here.

08:55.516 --> 08:57.018
It's about your partner.

08:57.020 --> 08:58.451
Eddie? What's going on?

08:58.453 --> 09:01.554
She's a good cop, right?
Reliable? Tough under pressure?

09:01.556 --> 09:02.954
Why you asking?

09:02.956 --> 09:04.459
Well, I might need her
for something, but I wanted

09:04.461 --> 09:06.493
to get your take on it
before I ran it by your boss.

09:06.495 --> 09:08.061
Yeah, she's the best.
She's tough as nails.

09:08.063 --> 09:09.366
I trust her with my life.

09:09.368 --> 09:11.566
Good, 'cause this is high risk.

09:11.568 --> 09:13.638
What does that mean? Undercover?

09:13.640 --> 09:15.174
Women are getting snatched up.

09:15.176 --> 09:16.942
We think it may be Serbian mob.

09:16.944 --> 09:19.606
I don't know
if she's ready for that, Danny.

09:19.608 --> 09:22.509
I mean, there's got to be
plenty of more experienced cops.

09:22.511 --> 09:24.779
No, no,
she's the only one for this.

09:24.781 --> 09:26.442
JAMIE: All right, well,
you asked my opinion.

09:26.444 --> 09:27.809
I gave it.
She's not ready.

09:27.811 --> 09:29.777
What do you mean, she's not ready?
Just what I said.

09:29.779 --> 09:31.049
I don't think she's
ready for that.

09:31.051 --> 09:33.520
Ready for what?

09:35.817 --> 09:38.987
Look, if this is about me,
I can speak for myself.

09:40.649 --> 09:42.046
(sighs)

09:42.048 --> 09:44.083
That's Ana Marcovic.

09:44.085 --> 09:46.250
Her mother e-mailed us
the photos,

09:46.252 --> 09:47.386
said her daughter's
only dream

09:47.388 --> 09:49.584
was to come to New York,
to the U.S.

09:49.586 --> 09:50.121
DANNY: Mm.

09:50.145 --> 09:51.854
She flew in
from Serbia this morning,

09:51.855 --> 09:53.685
and...

09:53.687 --> 09:56.158
presumably went to the address
for the Gotham Youth Hostel,

09:56.160 --> 09:57.695
and then, she disappeared.

09:57.697 --> 09:59.295
Five other girls
have gone missing

09:59.297 --> 10:01.263
the same way
over the last six months.

10:01.265 --> 10:03.726
So you need someone
to retrace Ana's steps,

10:03.728 --> 10:05.198
and find out where
the missing women went?

10:05.200 --> 10:07.164
You'll be wired up,
we'll stay close,

10:07.166 --> 10:09.364
but I do got
to be honest with you.

10:09.366 --> 10:10.804
It's... it's a total unknown.

10:10.806 --> 10:12.771
Well, uh, why me?

10:12.773 --> 10:15.633
Is it because I took the
undercover training course?

10:15.635 --> 10:16.968
DANNY:
That's part of it.

10:16.970 --> 10:19.037
The other part of it is,
when we were calling The Wheel

10:19.039 --> 10:21.204
looking for an officer
who spoke Serbian,

10:21.206 --> 10:23.138
you were the only one
in the entire department

10:23.140 --> 10:25.369
who fit the age
and physical profile.

10:25.371 --> 10:27.703
Yeah, I hope that means
young and hot.

10:27.705 --> 10:30.007
That is the type
they're luring in, yes.

10:30.009 --> 10:31.605
You think it's some kind
of trafficking ring?

10:31.607 --> 10:33.676
Like I said, it's an unknown.
(phone ringing)

10:33.678 --> 10:35.380
Excuse me.

10:35.382 --> 10:37.749
Well, when would this happen?

10:37.751 --> 10:40.014
Soon as we can get it running
if you're up for it.

10:40.857 --> 10:42.625
Yeah.

10:42.627 --> 10:44.521
Hell, yeah.
It's a great opportunity.

10:44.523 --> 10:46.497
Good.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.496
What is it?

10:51.529 --> 10:54.262
Ana Marcovic is dead, right?

10:54.264 --> 10:56.302
That's what that was about?

10:56.304 --> 10:57.903
We don't know that yet,

10:57.905 --> 10:59.776
but her cell phone
and backpack were found

10:59.778 --> 11:02.272
along the side
of the expressway.

11:02.274 --> 11:03.944
Her bag was covered
in blood.

11:20.134 --> 11:22.334
(sighs softly)

11:23.976 --> 11:26.374
Commissioner,
Clinton Hills just faxed over

11:26.376 --> 11:28.110
the psychiatrist's report.

11:28.112 --> 11:29.878
And?
It's more of the same.

11:29.880 --> 11:31.550
Lines up
with the counselor's report

11:31.552 --> 11:33.549
and the note in his file
from the chaplain.

11:33.551 --> 11:34.653
So it's official.

11:34.655 --> 11:37.821
Donald Berry
is the most rehabilitated killer

11:37.823 --> 11:39.725
in the history
of the penal system.

11:39.727 --> 11:41.221
They're just opinions, sir.

11:41.223 --> 11:43.959
I can't figure out
what this son of a bitch wants.

11:43.961 --> 11:46.496
I thought he wanted to make amends.
Maybe he just wants

11:46.498 --> 11:48.935
to get out of his cell,
break routine,

11:48.937 --> 11:52.839
get another chance
to torment his victim.

11:52.841 --> 11:54.807
(sighs)

11:54.809 --> 11:56.943
The thing is...

11:58.441 --> 11:59.775
...to Sarah,

11:59.777 --> 12:02.282
to me,

12:02.284 --> 12:06.524
he's always going
to be this guy.

12:10.963 --> 12:14.034
It was the single most
disturbing crime scene

12:14.036 --> 12:17.441
I've ever witnessed.

12:17.443 --> 12:20.441
And no amount of counseling
or medication

12:20.443 --> 12:23.112
or prayer
is ever gonna change that.

12:23.114 --> 12:26.079
I understand how you feel, sir,

12:26.081 --> 12:29.246
but... may I say something?

12:29.248 --> 12:30.982
Go ahead.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.982
People can change.

12:32.984 --> 12:34.718
That's it?

12:35.552 --> 12:37.022
Sometimes,

12:37.024 --> 12:38.358
with the right help,

12:38.360 --> 12:40.389
sick people do get better.

12:40.391 --> 12:42.429
Maybe even Donald Berry.

12:44.766 --> 12:47.458
I think that where there's life
there is always hope.

12:47.460 --> 12:49.065
And if you ever get the sense

12:49.067 --> 12:50.392
that I have lost
that conviction,

12:50.394 --> 12:52.927
please fire me on the spot.

13:03.407 --> 13:06.572
So, what
can I tell you, Erin?

13:06.574 --> 13:08.540
What do you mean?

13:08.542 --> 13:11.748
I just thought it would be nice
to have lunch.

13:11.750 --> 13:13.813
(chuckling):
Oh, come on.

13:13.815 --> 13:16.220
A mystery woman suddenly starts
dating your grandfather?

13:16.222 --> 13:18.188
(chuckles)
I'd want to know everything.

13:18.190 --> 13:22.628
Okay. I might just be
a little curious.

13:22.630 --> 13:24.091
Okay then.

13:24.093 --> 13:25.890
Here I am, Sylvia Hayden,

13:25.892 --> 13:27.897
in, uh, 30 seconds or less.

13:27.899 --> 13:29.497
Ready? Set your watch.

13:29.499 --> 13:30.959
(both chuckle)

13:30.961 --> 13:32.631
I was born
in the Bronx--

13:32.633 --> 13:36.396
well, Riverdale-- and I had
a quickie marriage at 19.

13:36.398 --> 13:38.267
He was so boring,

13:38.269 --> 13:39.633
I was a little crazy,

13:39.635 --> 13:41.367
and it lasted about 90 minutes.

13:41.369 --> 13:45.068
And then I was single
for a long time.

13:45.070 --> 13:48.130
I had a lot of fun.
And then, much later in life,

13:48.132 --> 13:50.994
I fell in love,
and I got married again.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.625
F-For real this time.

13:52.627 --> 13:54.031
And that was my Max.

13:54.033 --> 13:56.295
And, uh, unfortunately, he...

13:56.297 --> 13:59.198
he passed away
about ten years ago.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.135
Mm. I'm sorry.

14:01.137 --> 14:04.503
So was I. But I wound up
reinventing myself

14:04.505 --> 14:06.910
as, of all things,

14:06.912 --> 14:09.141
a romance novelist.

14:09.143 --> 14:10.813
(chuckles)
(chuckles) Well,

14:10.815 --> 14:13.643
Sylvia Attenberg
wasn't a catchy enough name,

14:13.645 --> 14:16.578
so Sylvia Hayden was born.

14:16.580 --> 14:18.281
Here I am.

14:18.283 --> 14:23.151
So Sylvia Hayden
is your... nom de plume?

14:23.153 --> 14:24.583
Yes. But...

14:24.585 --> 14:26.550
please don't bother
with those books.

14:26.552 --> 14:28.652
(whispers): They're trashy.
(chuckles)

14:28.654 --> 14:30.587
It's just that I feel, uh,

14:30.589 --> 14:33.859
a little less lonely
when I write them.

14:33.861 --> 14:36.458
Mm. Well, hopefully Henry

14:36.460 --> 14:39.561
is making you feel
a little less lonely, too.

14:39.563 --> 14:42.264
Let me be clear
about my intentions, Erin.

14:42.266 --> 14:45.164
I don't plan to marry again,

14:45.166 --> 14:47.795
but I think, your grandpa and I,

14:47.797 --> 14:50.195
we can be great pals.

14:50.197 --> 14:51.603
I hope
that sounds okay.

14:51.605 --> 14:53.170
Of course.

14:53.172 --> 14:54.202
Great.

14:54.204 --> 14:55.433
So let's order.

14:55.435 --> 14:57.305
And I insist
that it be my treat.

14:57.307 --> 15:00.438
Henry won't let me pay
for anything.

15:00.440 --> 15:02.573
Waiter?

15:02.575 --> 15:04.475
Waiter?

15:06.677 --> 15:08.843
Two menus, please.

15:14.979 --> 15:17.247
DANNY:
There she is.

15:18.648 --> 15:21.381
Thanks
for coming so fast.

15:21.383 --> 15:22.980
FBI? What's going on?

15:22.982 --> 15:24.652
We took all the
information we had,

15:24.654 --> 15:26.315
we ran it through
SafetyNet, we found out

15:26.317 --> 15:28.585
the Feds were investigating
the missing women, too.

15:28.587 --> 15:31.319
They have some good Intel
and much better resources,

15:31.321 --> 15:33.319
so it makes sense
to combine our cases.

15:33.321 --> 15:35.158
So they're in charge now?
No, no.

15:35.160 --> 15:36.454
This is a
joint operation.

15:36.456 --> 15:38.261
We will be with you
every step of the way,

15:38.263 --> 15:39.797
just like we told you.

15:39.799 --> 15:41.155
This is Hill.

15:41.157 --> 15:44.057
Hey.
Hey, Danny. Detective Baez.

15:44.059 --> 15:46.193
DANNY: This is Officer Janko.
She'll be the uncle.

15:46.195 --> 15:47.497
I'm Marcus Hill

15:47.499 --> 15:48.866
from the Bureau.
It's good to meet you.

15:48.868 --> 15:51.706
Our Serbian expert
is waiting.

15:51.708 --> 15:53.105
All right, come on.

15:53.907 --> 15:56.105
MAN:
This is your Serbian passport

15:56.107 --> 15:59.271
under the name Edit Jankovic.

15:59.273 --> 16:01.710
And, uh, here's
your boarding pass

16:01.712 --> 16:03.374
for your flight into JFK.

16:03.376 --> 16:06.580
What airport in Serbia
did you fly out of?

16:09.715 --> 16:12.112
Nikola Tesla in Belgrade.

16:12.114 --> 16:13.784
You say you're from Ecka?

16:13.786 --> 16:14.816
That's way out
in the Valley.

16:14.818 --> 16:16.687
Why the hell
would you fly out of Tesla?

16:16.689 --> 16:18.183
It's an international airport.

16:18.185 --> 16:20.750
So is Morava,
and it's 300 miles closer.

16:20.752 --> 16:24.421
Yeah, I was visiting
a friend in Belgrade first.

16:24.423 --> 16:26.061
Ah. What neighborhood?

16:26.063 --> 16:28.356
Barajevo? Novi Beograd?

16:28.358 --> 16:30.258
Grocka?
Novi.

16:30.260 --> 16:32.088
Novi? Is your friend Chinese?

16:32.090 --> 16:34.961
Novi is the only
Chinese quarter in Serbia.

16:34.963 --> 16:36.697
(chuckles)

16:36.699 --> 16:40.800
Okay, uh, how did you travel
to visit your Chinese friend?

16:40.802 --> 16:42.703
Car? Train? Bus?

16:42.705 --> 16:44.270
Bus.
What-what company?

16:44.272 --> 16:46.534
Arriva? Kevim? Severtrans?

16:47.375 --> 16:48.869
Uh, what highway did you take?

16:48.871 --> 16:50.141
How long
was the trip?

16:51.080 --> 16:52.246
Stupid bitch cop.
You're dead.

16:52.248 --> 16:53.343
Hey. Take it easy.

16:53.345 --> 16:54.951
You think
they're gonna take it easy?

16:54.953 --> 16:57.153
This is stuff
any Serb would know.

16:59.421 --> 17:01.322
You got three days.

17:01.324 --> 17:03.722
You better cram.

17:14.337 --> 17:15.672
What am I missing here, Sid?

17:15.674 --> 17:17.672
If the crowds
are blocking traffic,

17:17.674 --> 17:20.343
have Patrol break them up
in an orderly fashion.

17:20.345 --> 17:22.007
The crowds are there
because apparently

17:22.009 --> 17:24.343
an empanada
in the bakery's window

17:24.345 --> 17:26.046
looks like the Virgin Mary.

17:27.144 --> 17:28.582
Yeah.

17:28.584 --> 17:31.085
Looks like her how?

17:31.087 --> 17:33.253
I don't have the forensics, sir,
but it's clearly more

17:33.255 --> 17:36.787
of a cultural religious thing
and not just a traffic thing.

17:36.789 --> 17:39.754
Uh, have Patrol
put up barricades

17:39.756 --> 17:42.595
and punt this over
to Community Affairs.

17:42.597 --> 17:44.195
Commissioner, I'm sorry

17:44.197 --> 17:45.763
to bother you,
but Sarah Grant is here.

17:45.765 --> 17:48.498
She said she could wait, but...

17:48.500 --> 17:51.204
I'm gonna need ten.

17:51.206 --> 17:54.204
Okay.

17:58.045 --> 18:00.346
Hey.
I'm so sorry.

18:00.348 --> 18:02.211
I-I told her I could wait.

18:02.213 --> 18:05.548
Well, Baker's pretty good
at reading faces,

18:05.550 --> 18:08.989
and yours says
that something can't wait.

18:10.823 --> 18:13.124
I can't stop thinking about him.

18:13.126 --> 18:15.996
That he actually wrote me

18:15.998 --> 18:18.563
and that he wants to see me.

18:18.565 --> 18:21.867
Do you want to read the letter?

18:21.869 --> 18:24.066
N-No.

18:27.540 --> 18:30.707
I want to go and meet him.

18:30.709 --> 18:33.981
Face-to-face.

18:34.879 --> 18:36.150
(sighs)

18:36.152 --> 18:38.183
To what end?

18:42.761 --> 18:47.062
I try and push him out
of my head, and I can't.

18:47.064 --> 18:50.462
For the first time in years,

18:50.464 --> 18:52.997
I just can't.

18:52.999 --> 18:55.333
So I need to do something.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.772
Something or only this thing?

18:57.774 --> 19:00.069
(shuddering exhale)
Talk me out of it.

19:00.071 --> 19:03.108
You could've tossed the letter

19:03.110 --> 19:06.273
like you said,
but you brought it to me.

19:06.275 --> 19:10.312
Some part of you knows
it's time to deal with this.

19:10.314 --> 19:13.545
Oh, that's not talking me
out of it.

19:13.547 --> 19:16.123
Yeah, well,

19:16.125 --> 19:20.354
I've been around long enough
to know that's not gonna happen.

19:22.259 --> 19:25.256
But I'm going with you.

19:25.258 --> 19:27.592
(shuddering inhale)

19:27.594 --> 19:29.727
You'd do that?

19:29.729 --> 19:32.935
Strength in numbers.

19:33.769 --> 19:35.967
Thank you.

20:03.682 --> 20:06.341
Who was that?
Just work.

20:06.343 --> 20:08.506
Don't kid a kidder.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.944
We can talk
about it later, Grandpa.

20:10.946 --> 20:13.078
Uh-huh. Something about Sylvia.

20:13.080 --> 20:15.212
Pop...
I heard you two had lunch.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.348
What do you know?

20:19.518 --> 20:21.148
I had her checked out.

20:21.150 --> 20:23.515
Mm.
Sylvia Hayden is not

20:23.517 --> 20:26.552
her real name. In fact,
she's had many identities.

20:26.554 --> 20:27.983
And?
And...

20:27.985 --> 20:31.250
she has a history
with older men.

20:31.252 --> 20:33.217
You think I don't know that?

20:33.219 --> 20:35.352
Erin, I'm an ex-cop.

20:35.354 --> 20:37.488
You think
I didn't do my own digging?

20:37.490 --> 20:40.425
Of course she's got a past.
Who doesn't?

20:40.427 --> 20:42.592
I don't want to make you angry.

20:42.594 --> 20:44.161
I'm just enjoying
the woman's company,

20:44.163 --> 20:47.066
and I don't see any reason
to stop.

20:47.068 --> 20:49.970
Pop...
(sighs)

20:49.972 --> 20:53.306
there's an active warrant
for Sylvia's arrest

20:53.308 --> 20:56.408
in Palm Springs
for grand larceny.

20:59.482 --> 21:01.482
What do you want me to do?

21:01.484 --> 21:03.912
You want me to drop it,
I will.

21:03.914 --> 21:06.078
A warrant they'll extradite on?

21:06.080 --> 21:07.885
Yeah.

21:07.887 --> 21:09.884
Hmm.
(clicks tongue)

21:09.886 --> 21:13.385
We're supposed
to have a drink tonight

21:13.387 --> 21:15.816
later at the Hotel Elysée.

21:15.818 --> 21:17.951
(clears throat)
Come on, you two.

21:17.953 --> 21:19.518
Everybody's ready.
Yep. Coming.

21:19.520 --> 21:21.252
Here.
Thanks.

21:22.126 --> 21:24.657
We can have her arrested there.

21:24.659 --> 21:27.392
But are you sure
that's what you want to do?

21:29.290 --> 21:31.297
No.

21:38.065 --> 21:40.534
FRANK:
Anyway, it's just a...

21:40.536 --> 21:42.469
simple ceremony.
NICKY: I'd give anything

21:42.471 --> 21:43.972
to see you walk her
down the aisle.

21:43.974 --> 21:45.668
It's really sweet
what you're doing.

21:45.670 --> 21:47.004
LINDA: I think it's amazing
how she stayed

21:47.006 --> 21:48.003
in touch with you
all these years.

21:48.005 --> 21:49.075
JAMIE:
Someone saves my life,

21:49.077 --> 21:50.306
I'd stay in touch.
Right?

21:50.308 --> 21:53.544
It's an unusual bond.
A very special bond.

21:53.546 --> 21:55.186
Good to protect
the people you care about.

21:55.206 --> 21:56.040
HENRY: Everyone's

21:56.041 --> 21:57.877
always bashing
the cops.

21:57.879 --> 21:59.579
This is exactly
the kind of story

21:59.581 --> 22:01.275
that the public needs to hear.

22:01.277 --> 22:02.946
Well, Dad will never allow that.

22:02.948 --> 22:03.977
No.

22:03.979 --> 22:05.745
He's too private.

22:05.747 --> 22:08.218
You know, the real story
isn't the wedding.

22:08.220 --> 22:10.354
The real story is,
the day before,

22:10.356 --> 22:13.354
Sarah is going to sit down
face-to-face

22:13.356 --> 22:15.553
with the guy
who murdered her family.

22:15.555 --> 22:17.121
Why?

22:17.123 --> 22:21.394
Because he asked for it,
and... she wants to go.

22:21.396 --> 22:23.099
ERIN:
It's a program

22:23.101 --> 22:24.771
called Restorative Justice.

22:24.773 --> 22:27.266
Oh, I think that
is a terrible idea.

22:27.268 --> 22:28.802
Maybe some good gets done.

22:28.804 --> 22:30.303
Maybe she finds some closure.

22:30.305 --> 22:32.438
No such thing
in a case like this.

22:32.440 --> 22:34.101
NICKY:
But if it works,

22:34.103 --> 22:35.507
maybe he haunts her less.

22:35.509 --> 22:37.139
JACK: Is it like when
the principal

22:37.141 --> 22:39.337
has the bully apologize
for what he did?

22:39.339 --> 22:41.505
That's exactly what
it's supposed to be like, Jack.

22:41.507 --> 22:43.577
Yeah, times a hundred.

22:43.579 --> 22:44.913
Maybe that works
for eighth graders,

22:44.915 --> 22:46.881
but an animal
like Donald Berry

22:46.883 --> 22:48.216
does not deserve
this chance.

22:48.218 --> 22:49.343
I don't disagree.

22:49.345 --> 22:51.182
NICKY: But if it can
help Sarah at all,

22:51.184 --> 22:52.717
it's a chance you take.

22:52.719 --> 22:54.484
Really? What if it backfires?

22:54.486 --> 22:56.915
You're putting a lot
of trust in this guy, Dad.

22:56.917 --> 22:59.049
I'm not putting
any trust in him,

22:59.051 --> 23:01.656
and I'm sure as hell not gonna
let her go in there alone.

23:01.658 --> 23:04.023
You could bring all the
apostles and all the saints,

23:04.025 --> 23:05.716
and it wouldn't
make a difference.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.651
The really bad people--
they don't change.

23:07.653 --> 23:09.723
They just come up
with new ways

23:09.725 --> 23:11.690
to trick you
into thinking they did.

23:25.704 --> 23:28.335
Hey.
Hey-Hey.

23:28.337 --> 23:30.742
Can you help me make sense
of all this?

23:30.744 --> 23:32.940
No, I don't
think I can.

23:34.710 --> 23:37.812
You came all the way uptown,
you went through security,

23:37.814 --> 23:39.812
and you're not gonna
help me prep?

23:39.814 --> 23:41.748
No, because I don't think
you should do this.

23:41.750 --> 23:43.914
Why? Because I'm some
scared little girl

23:43.916 --> 23:45.418
who can't take care of herself?

23:45.420 --> 23:46.954
No, Eddie.
You could be a Navy Seal,

23:46.956 --> 23:48.321
and I'd tell you the same thing.

23:48.323 --> 23:49.688
This operation was thrown
together way too fast.

23:49.690 --> 23:51.151
You haven't had

23:51.153 --> 23:53.349
enough time to prep, and
you don't understand the risks.

23:53.351 --> 23:56.589
That I'm going in blind?

23:56.591 --> 23:58.724
That my life could be in danger?

23:58.726 --> 24:00.659
I agreed to that.

24:00.661 --> 24:04.132
I made peace with that the day
that I entered the academy.

24:04.999 --> 24:07.334
(throws pen on table)

24:07.336 --> 24:09.902
Besides, this one's personal.

24:09.904 --> 24:11.408
Why?

24:11.410 --> 24:13.978
Because of my mom.

24:13.980 --> 24:18.854
She was a young girl
from a small village in Serbia,

24:18.856 --> 24:21.989
and all she ever dreamed about
was coming to this country.

24:21.991 --> 24:24.062
And that dream came true
for her,

24:24.064 --> 24:28.096
and I think that Ana Marcovic
deserves the same chance.

24:29.906 --> 24:32.073
I'm doing this, Reagan.

24:36.611 --> 24:38.912
Okay, if I can't
talk you out of it,

24:38.914 --> 24:41.911
then... I'll say this.

24:41.913 --> 24:44.548
You should use
your mother's story.

24:44.550 --> 24:46.578
What do you mean?

24:46.580 --> 24:49.481
The best covers are the ones
that are closest to home.

24:49.483 --> 24:52.113
That way, under pressure,
you can just tell the truth,

24:52.115 --> 24:53.816
which is easiest
to remember.

24:56.417 --> 24:58.453
Did you ever have
any close calls?

24:58.455 --> 24:59.684
When I was a U/C?

24:59.686 --> 25:01.721
Yeah, the Sanfino Family
put a hit out on me.

25:01.723 --> 25:03.416
My father had to put me
on house arrest.

25:03.418 --> 25:05.424
Eddie, I was lucky
to get out alive.

25:05.426 --> 25:08.160
That was your first assignment,
right?

25:08.162 --> 25:10.361
They took a chance on you?

25:10.363 --> 25:12.962
That's all I'm asking for.

25:14.701 --> 25:18.108
I want to see
what I'm made of, too.

25:22.446 --> 25:24.643
(gentle piano music playing)

25:27.117 --> 25:29.377
Ah.
Sylvia.

25:29.379 --> 25:31.385
Whoa.

25:31.387 --> 25:33.585
Don't you look handsome.

25:35.755 --> 25:39.658
Last time I was
in here was 1973.

25:39.660 --> 25:41.689
I was a detective.

25:41.691 --> 25:44.424
This place was the scene of
one of the biggest robberies

25:44.426 --> 25:46.463
in the city's history.

25:46.465 --> 25:48.295
A robbery here?

25:48.297 --> 25:50.565
Well, in the Hotel
Elysée above us.

25:50.567 --> 25:52.533
Did you catch 'em?
Oh, yeah.

25:57.039 --> 25:59.838
That's what you have
to understand, Sylvia.

25:59.840 --> 26:01.110
Hmm?

26:01.112 --> 26:03.578
We get everyone in the end.

26:03.580 --> 26:06.481
What do you mean by that?

26:06.483 --> 26:09.353
I think you know what I mean.

26:09.355 --> 26:12.151
Dating a Reagan maybe

26:12.153 --> 26:14.392
wasn't the smartest
move on your part.

26:14.394 --> 26:16.959
That's because
it wasn't a move, Henry.

26:16.961 --> 26:19.460
You think I didn't expect
an ex-police commissioner

26:19.462 --> 26:21.427
to check me out?

26:21.429 --> 26:23.529
Or that I didn't notice
your granddaughter

26:23.531 --> 26:26.728
putting a teaspoon with
my fingerprints in her purse?

26:26.730 --> 26:28.864
Then why did you stay?

26:28.866 --> 26:30.431
I haven't done anything wrong.

26:30.433 --> 26:34.070
The DA in Palm Springs
says different.

26:34.072 --> 26:36.133
Palm Springs.

26:36.135 --> 26:38.700
Right. What a joke.

26:38.702 --> 26:41.435
We were both adults who knew

26:41.437 --> 26:43.674
exactly what we were
getting into.

26:43.676 --> 26:46.145
A man can't give a gift,

26:46.147 --> 26:48.946
and then expect it back
when things go sour.

26:48.948 --> 26:51.011
Sounds like it was
a pretty big gift.

26:51.013 --> 26:54.852
Well, I'm a pretty great gal.

26:55.854 --> 27:00.126
Henry, breaking
someone's heart is painful,

27:00.128 --> 27:02.997
but it doesn't make you
a criminal.

27:02.999 --> 27:06.196
You'll have to tell that
to the grand jury.

27:06.198 --> 27:08.403
What? Henry, please.

27:08.405 --> 27:11.202
I really like you.

27:13.035 --> 27:15.369
I hope you believe that.

27:16.738 --> 27:19.239
I choose to, Sylvia.

27:23.407 --> 27:25.644
Okay. Okay.

27:39.262 --> 27:42.628
I'm sorry I ruined this
for you, Grandpa.

27:44.662 --> 27:46.932
You were just
looking out for me.

28:02.745 --> 28:05.813
(vehicle approaching)

28:13.645 --> 28:15.042
Edit?

28:16.075 --> 28:17.545
Edit Jankovic?

28:17.547 --> 28:19.809
You're here for
the hostel, right?

28:19.811 --> 28:23.113
Yeah, we're supposed
to give you a lift.

28:23.115 --> 28:24.817
I'm Tatiana, by the way.

28:24.819 --> 28:26.584
Hi. Call me Eddie.

28:26.586 --> 28:28.920
Oh, Eddie.

28:32.225 --> 28:34.758
Um, let me take your bag.

28:34.760 --> 28:37.662
You can, um, sit up front.

28:40.129 --> 28:41.903
(van door closes)

29:05.528 --> 29:07.221
TATIANA:
Where are you from in Serbia?

29:07.223 --> 29:08.756
JANKO:
Ecka.

29:08.758 --> 29:10.555
TATIANA:
Oh, in the Valley.

29:10.557 --> 29:12.027
Yeah, I know Ecka well.

29:12.029 --> 29:13.595
When I was a kid, my family

29:13.597 --> 29:15.699
used to go
to, uh, Ecka Castle.

29:15.701 --> 29:17.997
So did mine.

29:17.999 --> 29:19.438
It's beautiful there.

29:19.440 --> 29:22.103
So sad it burned down.

29:22.105 --> 29:24.975
Oh, you must be confused.

29:24.977 --> 29:26.943
It... the castle
didn't burn down.

29:26.945 --> 29:29.984
They just turned it
into a resort for tourists.

29:29.986 --> 29:31.616
Same thing.

29:37.963 --> 29:39.258
Where are we going?

29:39.260 --> 29:41.500
I... I picked this hostel

29:41.502 --> 29:43.670
because I wanted
to be in the city.

29:43.672 --> 29:46.006
I need your phone,
your passport and your bag.

29:46.008 --> 29:48.342
Why?

29:48.344 --> 29:50.175
(Janko groans)

29:50.177 --> 29:51.975
TATIANA:
You do as we say.

30:00.884 --> 30:03.353
JAMIE:
<i>Wire's out.</i>

30:03.355 --> 30:05.385
All right, that's it. Light 'em
up. Danny, we're taking the van

30:05.387 --> 30:06.785
right now. Danny.
Hold on. Wait a second.

30:06.787 --> 30:08.385
We still got GPS?
Yeah.

30:08.387 --> 30:10.857
Then we wait.
Let me see if we can get a visual.

30:10.859 --> 30:14.129
Car two, you still
got eyes on our girl?

30:14.131 --> 30:16.698
HILL:
Yeah.

30:16.700 --> 30:18.002
She looks okay... for now.

30:18.004 --> 30:19.570
BAEZ:
Roger that.

30:28.846 --> 30:31.212
We're gonna see this operation
through, kid, all right?

30:31.214 --> 30:33.621
We got to let Eddie
do her job.

30:59.265 --> 31:02.465
Mr. Berry is on his way.

31:04.100 --> 31:06.938
(quietly):
Okay.

31:13.148 --> 31:15.212
(Frank sniffles)

31:15.214 --> 31:17.917
WOMAN:
Commissioner Reagan,

31:17.919 --> 31:20.086
you can watch through the glass.

31:25.066 --> 31:27.095
I'm staying with Sarah.

31:27.097 --> 31:29.567
There's no protocol for that.

31:29.569 --> 31:33.768
I'm staying, and if he so much
as looks sideways at her,

31:33.770 --> 31:35.936
I'm pulling her out.

31:47.324 --> 31:51.058
(feet shuffling on floor,
metallic clinking)

31:59.468 --> 32:02.138
Donald Berry-- Sarah Grant.

32:17.195 --> 32:19.930
Commissioner Reagan, Miss Grant,

32:19.932 --> 32:23.130
I would like to thank you both
for coming all this way

32:23.132 --> 32:25.097
to participate in this process.

32:25.099 --> 32:27.968
Before we start,
I just want you to know

32:27.970 --> 32:31.334
that I will never
forgive you, never.

32:31.336 --> 32:34.437
So if that's your purpose here,
then we can just leave now.

32:34.439 --> 32:36.740
Oh, I don't expect you
to forgive me.

32:36.742 --> 32:39.043
I don't forgive myself.

32:39.045 --> 32:41.075
So you understand what you did?

32:42.748 --> 32:44.810
I want you to look at these.

32:51.082 --> 32:53.351
I'm getting married tomorrow,

32:53.353 --> 32:55.917
and my family won't be there.

32:56.991 --> 33:00.124
My mom didn't help me
pick out a dress.

33:01.222 --> 33:03.157
My dad...

33:03.159 --> 33:05.525
won't get
to walk me down the aisle.

33:07.567 --> 33:10.868
And my brother--

33:10.870 --> 33:13.068
his name was Steven.

33:14.174 --> 33:17.676
Steven Evan Grant.

33:17.678 --> 33:21.412
Look at him.

33:21.414 --> 33:23.845
He was five years old,

33:23.847 --> 33:26.212
you pig.

33:26.214 --> 33:29.585
You animal.

33:29.587 --> 33:32.753
He didn't have a chance
to do anything.

33:33.892 --> 33:36.783
He didn't have a life.

33:36.785 --> 33:39.119
And you're still
sitting here,

33:39.121 --> 33:41.127
eating,

33:41.129 --> 33:43.931
watching TV,

33:43.933 --> 33:45.235
writing letters.

33:45.237 --> 33:47.807
And I'm
supposed to care

33:47.809 --> 33:50.807
that you're sorry?

33:50.809 --> 33:53.478
After what you stole from us?

33:54.983 --> 33:57.979
Who do you think you are?

33:57.981 --> 34:01.009
You don't deserve
to breathe air.

34:06.185 --> 34:08.748
I know exactly
what I was, Sarah,

34:08.751 --> 34:11.715
but that's not what I am now.

34:11.717 --> 34:15.891
That's why I asked you here.

34:17.260 --> 34:19.156
Go on, Donald,

34:19.158 --> 34:22.597
say what
you came to say.

34:22.599 --> 34:24.565
It was only when
I was locked up

34:24.568 --> 34:28.101
that I was finally given a
full psychiatric evaluation

34:28.103 --> 34:29.342
for the first time.

34:29.344 --> 34:32.940
I was diagnosed
as paranoid schizophrenic.

34:32.943 --> 34:36.748
I was prescribed
the proper medication.

34:36.751 --> 34:39.580
And it's only when the voices
in my head stopped

34:39.581 --> 34:42.284
that I realized

34:42.286 --> 34:45.283
the truly evil things
that I'd done.

34:47.291 --> 34:51.224
I couldn't
handle it.

34:51.226 --> 34:54.824
Commissioner, I dreamed
the bullet you fired

34:54.826 --> 34:56.864
hit three inches to the right,

34:56.867 --> 34:59.002
put me out of my misery.

34:59.837 --> 35:02.634
I had the same dream.

35:04.276 --> 35:06.243
But that's not
what happened.

35:06.245 --> 35:09.380
I saw the
horrible things

35:09.382 --> 35:10.747
I'd done to your family.

35:10.749 --> 35:13.745
It played
over and over

35:13.747 --> 35:17.016
and over and over and over
and over and over in my head.

35:17.018 --> 35:19.016
It drove me crazy.

35:19.018 --> 35:21.015
You should've killed yourself.

35:21.017 --> 35:22.822
Oh, I tried.

35:22.824 --> 35:23.990
It's what
I deserved.

35:23.992 --> 35:27.421
And I was so angry
at the guards when they

35:27.423 --> 35:30.925
saved me.
For what?

35:30.927 --> 35:33.461
What purpose? Why, why?

35:35.464 --> 35:38.071
But there was
a prison chaplain that...

35:38.073 --> 35:41.703
in the infirmary,
and we started talking,

35:41.705 --> 35:43.208
and we talked.

35:43.210 --> 35:45.408
And talked.

35:46.482 --> 35:48.344
And something happened.

35:51.723 --> 35:53.818
I found God, Sarah.

35:56.429 --> 35:57.826
Or God found me.

35:57.828 --> 36:01.529
I found
a purpose.

36:01.531 --> 36:03.664
And whatever's left of my life

36:03.666 --> 36:07.533
I've dedicated it to other
prisoners in crisis.

36:07.535 --> 36:11.100
And it's made me
feel human again,

36:11.102 --> 36:13.499
and to know
what it is

36:13.501 --> 36:16.035
to try to be
a good person.

36:17.236 --> 36:21.071
But I know the only person
I can't save is you, Sarah.

36:22.936 --> 36:24.942
And I'm so...

36:24.944 --> 36:27.677
dreadfully sorry for that.

36:34.887 --> 36:38.487
If you're really sorry,

36:38.489 --> 36:41.592
you will try
and kill yourself again.

36:43.962 --> 36:46.361
And you'll
get it right this time.

37:05.523 --> 37:08.552
I think we're done here.

37:23.070 --> 37:24.070
They stopped.

37:24.293 --> 37:26.002
We got to get there.
Relax,

37:26.539 --> 37:27.737
we know where she is, okay?

37:27.739 --> 37:29.809
BAEZ:
5-4 detectives requesting

37:29.811 --> 37:33.280
a 10-13 at 1399 Claremont.

37:33.282 --> 37:35.945
We have a missing undercover
at this location.

37:35.947 --> 37:36.985
JAMIE: We can't wait
for backup, Danny.

37:36.987 --> 37:38.649
You know what can happen
in 30 seconds.

37:44.683 --> 37:46.846
On our way to location.
We're going in.

37:46.848 --> 37:49.980
Roger that. Make sure
you put your vests on.

37:49.982 --> 37:52.347
We better get her out.

37:52.349 --> 37:54.553
We'll get her out.

38:05.796 --> 38:08.001
(indistinct conversations)

38:23.174 --> 38:25.275
Take off your clothes,
get on the bed.

38:26.413 --> 38:27.947
Why?

38:27.949 --> 38:30.611
(short chuckle)

38:30.613 --> 38:32.819
Why do you think?

38:48.339 --> 38:50.705
Wait.

38:50.707 --> 38:53.543
I want to take a shower first.

38:54.976 --> 38:56.509
I want to be clean for you.

38:59.446 --> 39:01.148
Make it fast.

39:04.286 --> 39:06.484
(door closes)

39:11.360 --> 39:12.833
All right, you guys take
the back entrance over there.

39:12.835 --> 39:14.329
We'll go up front.

39:14.331 --> 39:17.034
Come on, we got to move.
Let's go.

39:19.110 --> 39:20.647
I told you fast.

39:20.649 --> 39:23.184
(shower running)
JANKO: Why don't you join me?

39:38.301 --> 39:40.603
(grunting)

39:41.669 --> 39:43.571
Police. Police.
Police. Police.

39:43.573 --> 39:45.043
Get on the ground, right now.
Now!

39:45.045 --> 39:47.475
Get back against
the wall, back up.

39:47.477 --> 39:48.739
Right now.

39:48.741 --> 39:50.949
(woman whimpering)

39:52.887 --> 39:54.453
Gun!
(gunshots)

39:54.455 --> 39:55.718
(woman screams)

39:57.489 --> 39:59.762
(grunts)

39:59.764 --> 40:01.627
Cover me.
Yeah, I got you.

40:01.629 --> 40:03.963
Police!

40:03.965 --> 40:05.500
(man grunts, woman screams)

40:06.639 --> 40:07.669
Police!

40:07.671 --> 40:09.038
Eddie!

40:09.040 --> 40:10.743
JAMIE (muffled):
Police, nobody move!

40:10.745 --> 40:13.744
Get down, get down on
the ground. Eddie?

40:15.050 --> 40:16.617
Danny, what
do you got?

40:16.619 --> 40:18.554
Drop the gun.
Drop the gun.

40:18.556 --> 40:20.796
On the ground, right now.
Get down on the ground.

40:21.831 --> 40:23.133
JAMIE:
Eddie!

40:23.135 --> 40:25.167
(whimpering)
Hey!

40:25.169 --> 40:26.569
Show me your hands,
show me your hands.

40:26.571 --> 40:28.538
Get down on the ground.
(grunts)

40:28.540 --> 40:30.779
Hands behind your back.

40:30.781 --> 40:31.947
Back up against the wall.

40:31.949 --> 40:33.716
Back up against the wall.
(sobbing)

40:33.718 --> 40:35.253
They tried to kidnap me.

40:35.255 --> 40:36.621
We're gonna help you.
Stay put.

40:36.623 --> 40:38.853
No, they raped me.
I said stay back.

40:40.327 --> 40:41.621
Don't even think about it.

40:41.623 --> 40:43.421
Eddie.
Hands off the gun. Now.

40:44.231 --> 40:45.861
Now.
(grunts)

40:49.031 --> 40:50.429
This is the ringleader--

40:50.431 --> 40:53.070
she was in the van.

40:57.207 --> 40:58.573
Game's over, kucka.

40:58.575 --> 41:00.045
Hands behind your head.

41:00.047 --> 41:02.646
Now!

41:10.824 --> 41:13.486
(crying)
JANKO: Ana?

41:18.760 --> 41:20.968
Good work.

41:25.139 --> 41:27.370
(”Wedding March” plays)

41:47.335 --> 41:49.701
Um...

41:52.167 --> 41:55.069
Sarah asked me to say a few
words, so thank you in advance

41:55.071 --> 41:57.711
for indulging me.

41:59.849 --> 42:02.613
I've known Sarah
since she was six years old

42:02.615 --> 42:05.211
and I couldn't
be happier--

42:05.213 --> 42:08.053
or more proud of her--

42:08.055 --> 42:10.589
than I am right now.

42:13.726 --> 42:15.428
David.

42:16.556 --> 42:18.922
You're a lucky guy.

42:23.700 --> 42:27.202
Before I turn this show
over to Father Barnes,

42:27.204 --> 42:30.139
I would like to take a moment

42:30.141 --> 42:32.373
to remember Sarah's father,

42:32.375 --> 42:35.480
Steven Grant,
her mother,

42:35.482 --> 42:38.720
Elizabeth,

42:38.722 --> 42:42.424
and her brother, Steven Jr.

42:46.360 --> 42:49.660
I know they're happy
for Sarah today.

42:54.660 --> 42:56.699
BARNES:
Sarah, David,

42:56.701 --> 43:01.172
will you please join hands
and face each other?

43:02.974 --> 43:04.644
We are gathered
here today

43:04.646 --> 43:06.708
to join this man and this
woman in holy matrimony.
