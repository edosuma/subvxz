13:22.836 --> 13:24.537
They would never
let me be a spy.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.706
I can't even
dress like a spy.

13:26.739 --> 13:28.675
Look at you
and your tailored...

13:28.708 --> 13:30.710
Everything is cut right.

13:30.743 --> 13:33.413
And mine is like a lumpy
pumpkin sack dress.

13:33.446 --> 13:34.948
Oh, come...

13:34.982 --> 13:36.516
It doesn't even have a label.
Does not have a label.

13:36.549 --> 13:37.517
I think my mom made it.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.052
No, stop.

13:39.086 --> 13:40.687
I should get on my hands
and knees and start scooping.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.222
Good God.
Go easy on yourself.

13:42.255 --> 13:43.390
Okay.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.092
We're a perfect team.
That's why we work.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.125
Yeah.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.327

13:49.897 --> 13:50.998
Come here. Close.

(SILVERWARE CLATTERING)

13:54.067 --> 13:55.568
I think
you're getting pinkeye.

13:55.602 --> 13:57.237
What? No.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.838
Right there.
No, that's not...

13:58.872 --> 14:01.008
Did you wipe your eye after
you cleaned out the cat box?

14:01.041 --> 14:02.041
I don't have cats.

14:02.675 --> 14:03.743
Why did I think that?

14:03.776 --> 14:05.045
I don't know.

14:05.078 --> 14:07.014
You should get some.
They're good company.

ELAINE:
We've intercepted chatter...

14:15.755 --> 14:17.657
that the weapon is still being
offered to the highest bidder.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.160
Someone other than Boyanov
knows where that nuke is.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.929
It's probably
his daughter, Rayna.

14:21.962 --> 14:24.131
She's really the only
person he's trusted.

14:24.164 --> 14:25.798
Jesus, Cooper,
do you have pinkeye?

14:25.832 --> 14:27.500
Go home. You're going
to infect everybody.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.136
Told you.

14:29.169 --> 14:31.271
No, it's not
pinkeye, ma'am.

14:31.304 --> 14:34.174
It's just I'm having a bit
of an allergic reaction.

Well, I'm allergic
to disgusting

14:37.810 --> 14:39.712
Sorry.
Anyway, you're right.

14:39.746 --> 14:41.214
After Boyanov's death,

14:41.248 --> 14:44.417
Rayna went to a safety deposit
box at a DSK bank in Varna.

14:44.451 --> 14:45.718
The chatter picked up
later that night.

14:45.752 --> 14:46.753
What do we know
about her?

14:46.786 --> 14:47.786
I can pull up her file.

14:49.122 --> 14:50.690
Oh, that's stuck.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.225
It's just a little
warm in here.

14:53.793 --> 14:55.762
Pull up my file...
Jesus! Not my keyboard

14:55.795 --> 14:57.897
with your pinkeye-infected
fingers!

14:57.931 --> 14:59.166
Why don't you
just cry directly

14:59.199 --> 15:00.900
into my mouth
while you're at it?

15:00.934 --> 15:02.869
It really is just
an allergic reaction...

15:02.902 --> 15:04.737

15:19.752 --> 15:21.488
of the Chechen Martyrs'
Brigade.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.790
We have compelling evidence that
he has the machinery in place

15:23.823 --> 15:25.058
to get that nuke
to New York in time

15:25.092 --> 15:26.559
for next week's
UN General Assembly.

15:26.593 --> 15:27.794
I'm already packed.

15:27.827 --> 15:29.096
One of our sources was told

15:29.129 --> 15:30.663
she has taken up residence
outside of Sofia.

15:30.697 --> 15:31.697
Go get her.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.701
Grab my things, Coop.

15:36.803 --> 15:39.439
Jesus, Cooper, go put on
some sunglasses or something.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.674
I feel like you're a Gypsy,
cursing me with it.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.143
Yep, I'm on it.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.611
Yeah, that's all good.

Hey, Super Cooper.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.649
Oh! Um...

15:49.682 --> 15:54.087
I just was feeling
a little weird about...

15:54.121 --> 15:56.489
Oh, yeah? ...some of the stuff,
and I think the intel...

15:56.523 --> 16:00.127
on Rayna's location
seems a little too easy.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.695
I just...
Something doesn't feel right.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.397
It'll be right when
we get Rayna behind bars

16:04.431 --> 16:06.366
and that nuke
back in our hands.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.603
Yeah, sure. I just...

16:10.637 --> 16:13.640
I don't know. All my alarm bells
are going off with this one.

16:13.673 --> 16:18.678
Really? Well, then, it's
okay 'cause I have a plan.

16:18.711 --> 16:21.581
You and I gotta stop going
on these awful missions.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.016
Run off together.

Do I mean that?
You got me. You kidder.

Don't be.
God, I admire you.

16:50.177 --> 16:51.844
NANCY: "I admire you"?

16:51.878 --> 16:54.681
Well, did he at least say it
in a flirty tone that says...

16:54.714 --> 16:58.651
"And because of my admiration, I
shall now take my shirt off...

16:58.685 --> 17:00.887
"and penetrate ye"?
No.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.222
The only way he'd
invite me to his bedroom

17:02.255 --> 17:03.756
is if he wants me
to fix his bed.

Wow. Okay, we could
order you your own glass.

17:11.998 --> 17:13.599
That was mine!

three years ago.

Well, Jerry was a jackass.

17:24.042 --> 17:25.912
When I gave up teaching
to join the CIA,

17:25.944 --> 17:27.280
I thought everything
was gonna be different.

17:27.314 --> 17:29.249
I thought I was gonna be
this amazing spy.

17:29.282 --> 17:31.084
I'm just the same boring
person I was before.

loves this. All right.

the same thing?

of tongue there.

"Well-behaved women
seldom make history"?

18:14.494 --> 18:16.028
Yeah. That's never
how she said it.

18:16.062 --> 18:18.097

18:18.131 --> 18:20.167
"Just blend in."
"Let somebody else win."

lot in high school.

in my lunchbox.

21:32.393 --> 21:34.595
FINE: No security.
(SCOFFS)

21:34.628 --> 21:37.531
Her father would never have
left himself this exposed.

21:37.565 --> 21:40.468
Pull back, Fine.
This is too easy.

21:40.501 --> 21:41.735
I like things that are easy.

21:48.041 --> 21:49.309
(NECK CRACKING)

21:49.343 --> 21:51.379
Oh, my God, Fine!

21:51.412 --> 21:52.946
I don't know how
you do things like that.

21:52.980 --> 21:54.348
Hey.

21:54.382 --> 21:56.116
Who's the finest of them all?

21:56.149 --> 21:57.951
I don't know.

21:57.985 --> 21:59.620
I'm guessing you?

22:00.287 --> 22:01.922
Drop your weapon.

22:01.955 --> 22:03.457
Fine, what's happening?

22:03.491 --> 22:04.958
Let me guess.
Whoever is in your ear

22:04.992 --> 22:06.560
wants to know
what's happening?

22:07.628 --> 22:09.697
(SOFTLY) He's about to die.

22:09.730 --> 22:11.399
That's what.

22:15.369 --> 22:17.505
An awfully big gun
for such a little girl.

22:17.538 --> 22:20.608
Oh, God, don't say
stuff like that.

22:20.641 --> 22:22.142
Okay, there's a knife rack
directly to your right.

22:22.175 --> 22:24.812
The way she's holding the gun,
she's not experienced.

22:24.845 --> 22:27.515
If you duck and lunge, you can
get the knife and disarm her.

22:27.548 --> 22:29.868
Did someone just suggest that
you grab one of those knives?

22:31.018 --> 22:32.786
No, no, no!

22:32.820 --> 22:33.820
Damn it!

22:34.087 --> 22:35.087
Fine!

22:36.323 --> 22:37.958
Can they see me right now?

22:39.493 --> 22:40.933
Let me adjust
the angle a little bit.

22:41.495 --> 22:42.696
(GUNSHOT)
(GASPS)

22:46.934 --> 22:48.402
Oh, my God, Fine.

22:50.438 --> 22:53.907
His name was Bradley Fine.
He worked for the CIA.

22:53.941 --> 22:55.676
Other top agents include

22:55.709 --> 22:58.378
Matthew Wright,
Timothy Cress...

22:58.412 --> 23:01.281
Rick Ford and Karen Walker.

23:01.314 --> 23:03.617
Come on, Fine. Come on.

23:03.651 --> 23:07.555
I know who all
your active agents are.

23:07.588 --> 23:11.124
So, unless you'd like
the body count to grow...

23:11.158 --> 23:13.694
I suggest you stay
far away from me.

23:14.695 --> 23:16.396
Now grab some tissues,

23:16.430 --> 23:18.666
because shit's about
to get real sad.

23:18.699 --> 23:19.699
FINE: No, no...
(GUNSHOT)

23:24.104 --> 23:25.606
Oh, my God, Fine.

23:26.173 --> 23:28.776
As Deputy Director...

23:28.809 --> 23:32.212
I have never had
a more difficult duty...

23:32.245 --> 23:36.249
than to bid farewell
to colleagues taken from us.

23:36.283 --> 23:39.419
From Dover,
to the family services...

23:39.453 --> 23:41.622
to memorials like these...

23:41.655 --> 23:42.990
it's tough to say goodbye.

23:43.023 --> 23:45.559
There's nothing you
could have done, Susan.

23:45.593 --> 23:49.697
Bradley Fine was more than
just a coworker and a friend.

23:49.730 --> 23:51.565
He was part of our family.

23:51.599 --> 23:53.867
And as family,
even knowing that the universe

23:53.901 --> 23:56.804
has a plan
for each human life...

23:56.837 --> 23:58.472
it's hard to accept
the sudden loss

23:58.506 --> 24:01.475
of such a good
and decent person.

24:04.211 --> 24:06.614
SUSAN: (ON TAPE) Okay, there's a
knife rack directly to your right.

24:06.647 --> 24:09.416
Susan, I got your assessment
report on Rayna Boyanov.

24:09.449 --> 24:11.985
I know you're probably feeling
a lot of emotion right now...

24:12.019 --> 24:15.188
but please refrain from using
the term "thundercunt."

24:16.490 --> 24:18.492
Oh, my God. I didn't
realize I wrote that.

24:18.526 --> 24:19.927
I'm sorry.

24:29.002 --> 24:30.303
Nancy, I'm sending
you a photo.

24:30.337 --> 24:31.705
It's in pretty bad shape.

24:31.739 --> 24:33.073
Can you enhance it?
Mm-hmm.

24:42.215 --> 24:43.584
Paris?

24:44.818 --> 24:48.055
How the fuck did this twat
find out our fucking names?

24:48.088 --> 24:49.523
We don't know.

24:49.557 --> 24:51.825
And dial it way back
with the "T" word, Ford.

24:51.859 --> 24:54.261
You're not immune from the
HR department. Grow up.

24:54.294 --> 24:56.329
And "twat" means something
completely different in England.

24:56.363 --> 24:58.065
Here it means a vagina.

24:58.098 --> 25:00.668
Anyway, obviously
we're talking about a mole.

25:00.701 --> 25:02.202
It could be a mole, they could
have hacked our system.

25:02.235 --> 25:03.270
It's anyone's guess.

25:03.303 --> 25:05.739
The bottom line is Rayna
Boyanov is about to sell...

25:05.773 --> 25:07.675
a small-scale tactical
nuclear weapon

25:07.708 --> 25:09.209
to a terrorist
organization...

25:09.242 --> 25:11.879
and we don't know
where she or the bomb is.

25:11.912 --> 25:14.281
Fortunately, our analyst
Susan Cooper found a lead.

25:15.716 --> 25:17.951
Rayna had the number
of Sergio De Luca...

25:17.985 --> 25:19.687
and we've long
suspected De Luca

25:19.720 --> 25:22.623
of working as an intermediary
with terrorist groups.

25:22.656 --> 25:24.925
Rayna may be using him
to find buyers for the nuke.

25:24.958 --> 25:27.595
The number was to an office
he keeps in Paris.

25:27.628 --> 25:29.429
I told you to send me in
there instead of Fine,

25:29.462 --> 25:30.831
and you didn't.

25:30.864 --> 25:32.600
And now Fine is dead.
I'm going the fuck in.

25:32.633 --> 25:34.167
You can't.

25:34.201 --> 25:36.103
We need someone to follow De
Luca without being detected...

25:36.136 --> 25:38.238
and that will hopefully
take us to Rayna...

25:38.271 --> 25:39.773
but it can't be any of you.

25:40.507 --> 25:42.810
Here's what we do...

25:42.843 --> 25:46.313
I go into the Face/Off
machine, get a whole new face.

25:46.346 --> 25:48.515
I turn up,
they never know it's me.

25:48.548 --> 25:49.683
Do you have quarters?
Because it costs 50 cents.

25:49.717 --> 25:51.284
What, I gotta pay?

25:51.318 --> 25:53.386
No, because it doesn't exist.

25:53.420 --> 25:54.955
Yes, it does!

25:54.988 --> 25:58.592
I heard Cress and Wright talking
about it in the shitter.

25:58.626 --> 26:00.427
I'm pretty sure
they were pulling your leg.

26:00.460 --> 26:02.529
You pair of fucking vaginas.

26:02.562 --> 26:04.798
Seriously,
you've got to cut that out.

26:04.832 --> 26:07.467
Jesus. Look, one of us
has to go in.

26:07.500 --> 26:09.136
Doesn't matter
if we've been exposed.

26:09.169 --> 26:10.838
We've all gone deep before,

26:10.871 --> 26:12.740
and we've always
gotten our guy.

26:12.773 --> 26:15.175
Guys, this is more than
just a kill mission.

26:15.208 --> 26:17.811
We can get Rayna, De Luca, and
some top terrorist leadership...

26:17.845 --> 26:20.047
and get the weapon back
if we do this right.

26:20.080 --> 26:21.715
We just need someone
who can shadow them

26:21.749 --> 26:23.717
without attracting attention.

26:23.751 --> 26:24.685
We need someone invisible.

26:24.718 --> 26:25.953
I'll do it.

26:25.986 --> 26:28.188
Okay, thanks, lunch lady.

26:28.221 --> 26:29.489
I'm serious.

26:29.522 --> 26:31.524
I have never
been out in the field.

26:31.558 --> 26:33.961
Exactly. Stupid fucking idea.

26:33.994 --> 26:36.496
My point is that
it's highly doubtful

26:36.529 --> 26:38.198
that I've ever been exposed.

26:38.231 --> 26:40.133
But you worked with Fine.

26:40.167 --> 26:41.234
They may have
a record of you, too.

26:41.268 --> 26:42.836
SUSAN: Possibly.

26:42.870 --> 26:45.706
But the odds of them
knowing my face are very low.

26:45.739 --> 26:47.708
Miss Crocker, I would
really like to do this.

26:47.741 --> 26:49.442
For Fine.

26:49.476 --> 26:51.879
What are you gonna do? Bring one
of your cats as a sidekick?

26:52.713 --> 26:54.147
I don't have any cats!

26:54.181 --> 26:56.817
You're not seriously
considering this, are you?

26:57.417 --> 26:59.052
Look here, Betty...

26:59.086 --> 27:00.754
Ford, if you call me
Betty Crocker,

27:00.788 --> 27:02.622
I will rip your fucking
heart out of your chest.

27:02.656 --> 27:04.658
Not only did I
become a citizen

27:04.692 --> 27:07.360
and take a vow
to protect this country...

27:07.394 --> 27:11.699
I also took a vow to avenge my
fallen comrades. We all fucking did.

27:11.732 --> 27:14.301
No, we didn't.
Not me.

27:14.334 --> 27:17.437
I'm pretty sure we all took a fucking vow.
I remember it.

27:17.470 --> 27:20.573
I remember raising my fucking
hand and saying some shit.

27:20.607 --> 27:22.876
If you think
I'm gonna sit by

27:22.910 --> 27:24.550
and let you send in
a fucking secretary...

27:24.577 --> 27:26.579
to do my work...

27:26.613 --> 27:28.181
you might as well accept
my resignation now.

27:28.215 --> 27:29.750
If I can jump in,

27:29.783 --> 27:32.652
I am technically, uh,
classified as an agent.

27:33.353 --> 27:34.888
Look...

27:34.922 --> 27:36.824
SUSAN: Full agent. So...

27:36.857 --> 27:39.326
agent, agent, agent,
I'm an agent.

27:39.993 --> 27:41.895
Are you considering this?

27:41.929 --> 27:44.497
For your safety, and the safety
of those around this table...

27:44.531 --> 27:46.233
I am considering it.

27:46.266 --> 27:48.335
Then consider this,
I quit.

27:51.739 --> 27:53.140
And I know there's a fucking
Face/Off machine.

27:53.173 --> 27:55.208
You're just keeping it
secret from me.

27:56.209 --> 27:57.845
Okay.

27:57.878 --> 27:59.518
That hasn't happened before.
(DOOR CLOSES)

28:01.014 --> 28:02.816
It is quite
a lovely office.

28:03.616 --> 28:04.852
What's your deal, Cooper?

28:05.318 --> 28:06.453
What do you mean?

28:06.486 --> 28:08.288
You got a fiery side?

28:08.321 --> 28:11.558
I really did, in that report,
mean to write "cunning."

28:11.591 --> 28:12.993
I've been going over
your files.

28:13.026 --> 28:15.195
You were top of your class
at the Academy,

28:15.228 --> 28:16.629
in all computer
and support skills.

28:16.663 --> 28:17.798
No surprise there.

28:17.831 --> 28:19.699
But you have a certain...

28:19.733 --> 28:21.902
tame demeanor
around the office,

28:21.935 --> 28:23.536
that says you've never
even held a gun.

28:23.570 --> 28:26.439
So imagine my surprise...

28:26.473 --> 28:28.513
when I saw footage from
this drill back at The Farm.

28:32.980 --> 28:34.882
SUSAN: Is that...
I can't even...

28:34.915 --> 28:36.116
Is that me? I can't really...
(GUN CLICKING)

28:36.149 --> 28:37.389
SUSAN: (ON COMPUTER)
Stupid gun!

28:38.786 --> 28:40.253
Somebody definitely
sped this up.

28:41.321 --> 28:42.890
Ooh! Camera angle
and stuff make...

28:43.423 --> 28:44.992
(YELLING)

28:45.025 --> 28:46.459
Cooper, Cooper, stop!
Jesus Christ, what are you...

28:46.493 --> 28:47.828
Ouch.

28:47.861 --> 28:49.262
Out of context, that's...

28:50.297 --> 28:52.432
I must have watched
this 15 times now...

28:52.465 --> 28:54.101
because what the fuck?

28:54.134 --> 28:55.936
I almost put it up
on YouTube.

28:55.969 --> 29:00.107
I was, to say the least,
uncomfortable with the event.

29:00.140 --> 29:02.109
But I would also like to say,
it was over 10 years ago.

29:02.142 --> 29:03.410
The instructor
was not harmed.

29:03.443 --> 29:05.645
Fine was your mentor, right?

29:05.678 --> 29:07.114
Yes.

29:07.147 --> 29:10.050
Why did you not
become a field agent?

29:10.083 --> 29:11.551
Well, we're such a great
fit and a great team.

29:11.584 --> 29:13.386
Fine made
some great points.

29:13.420 --> 29:16.323
Maybe I match better with,
just staying...

29:16.356 --> 29:17.958
In his ear.
Well...

29:17.991 --> 29:19.459
Yeah, he sniped you.

29:19.492 --> 29:21.461
All the top agents used to
do that before I got here.

29:21.494 --> 29:23.263
I really thought he made
some great points.

29:24.231 --> 29:26.066
Women.

29:26.099 --> 29:27.567
All right, have you had any
field training since then?

29:27.600 --> 29:28.601
10 years is a long time.

29:28.635 --> 29:30.270
No, ma'am.

29:30.303 --> 29:32.906
Normally, I would send you back to
The Farm, but there's no time...

29:32.940 --> 29:35.242
and I can't take a chance of
anyone leaking your name.

29:35.275 --> 29:37.110
(LAUGHING)
Am I going?

29:37.610 --> 29:38.711
You're going.

29:38.745 --> 29:41.214
Okay. Jeez. Sorry.

29:41.248 --> 29:45.018
But it's a track and report
mission only.

29:45.452 --> 29:46.719
Got it.

29:46.753 --> 29:47.921
We'll be giving you
a new identity.

29:47.955 --> 29:49.689
You'll no longer be
Susan Cooper.

29:49.722 --> 29:51.892
I had a few ideas for that.
Your new name...

29:51.925 --> 29:53.526
I was just spitballing
and I thought...

29:53.560 --> 29:55.628
Seraphina,
Maddox, Gisele...

29:55.662 --> 29:57.297
Carol Jenkins.

29:57.330 --> 29:58.598
Carol Jenkins.

29:58.631 --> 30:00.300
If I may, ma'am,

30:00.333 --> 30:03.436
there was a 13-year-old girl
named Carol...

30:03.470 --> 30:05.572
that used to kind of take me
around the neighborhood...

30:05.605 --> 30:07.207
and use my braid
as a dog leash...

30:07.240 --> 30:09.342
and make me
beg for biscuits...

30:09.376 --> 30:10.978
Carol Jenkins.

30:11.011 --> 30:13.380
Yes. Carol Jenkins, huh?

30:13.413 --> 30:15.883
Carol Jenkins
is a single mother of four...

30:15.916 --> 30:18.051
temporarily relocated
from Delaware

30:18.085 --> 30:19.887
to increase sales
for a software company.

30:19.920 --> 30:21.821
Okay, that is...

30:21.855 --> 30:23.356
a different occup...

30:25.058 --> 30:27.327
Is there a problem?
No.

30:27.360 --> 30:30.160
I was just wondering if this was my
family, or if I had taken hostages.

30:31.031 --> 30:32.699
I'm just not sure...

30:32.732 --> 30:35.002
how De Luca is gonna take me
seriously if I look like this.

30:35.035 --> 30:37.037
De Luca is not going to
take you anything.

30:37.070 --> 30:38.205
In case
you did not hear me...

30:38.238 --> 30:39.606
you are not to make
direct contact

30:39.639 --> 30:41.308
with any of the targets.

30:41.341 --> 30:43.776

30:43.810 --> 30:45.345
We're setting you up
in a surveillance office

30:45.378 --> 30:46.980
across the street
from De Luca's.

30:47.014 --> 30:48.515
You'll be tapped into
the same telecom trunk...

30:48.548 --> 30:51.018
and have access to voice and
data coming into his office...

30:51.051 --> 30:52.251
and that is as sexy
as it gets.

30:52.585 --> 30:54.021
One mistake,

30:54.054 --> 30:56.389
and we've got a nuclear bomb
in the hands of terrorists.

30:56.423 --> 30:57.357
Do you understand?

30:57.390 --> 30:58.858
Yes.

30:58.892 --> 31:00.892
Go see Patrick. He's got
special equipment for you.

31:05.365 --> 31:07.567
Oh, my God.

31:07.600 --> 31:08.969
What are you doing?

31:11.404 --> 31:12.940
Did you come up
with your spy name yet?

31:12.973 --> 31:15.408
Mine would be
"Amber Valentine."

31:15.442 --> 31:17.410
That sounds like
you're an adult film star.

31:17.444 --> 31:19.179
No, I did the spy
name formula.

31:19.212 --> 31:20.480
"Amber" was the name
of my first pet,

31:20.513 --> 31:21.949
and I grew up
on Valentine Street.

31:21.982 --> 31:23.816
That's how you come up
with your porn name.

31:23.850 --> 31:25.752
I thought it was your spy name!
No!

31:25.785 --> 31:27.120
What would yours be?

31:27.154 --> 31:29.656
"Meatball Martin
Luther King Jr. Boulevard."

31:30.557 --> 31:31.624
Yeah.
Wow.

31:33.493 --> 31:35.228
Oh, my God.

31:36.629 --> 31:37.597
This is so exciting!

31:37.630 --> 31:38.765
(LAUGHS)

31:38.798 --> 31:39.899
You're a spy!

31:39.933 --> 31:41.201
I know! I know!

31:41.234 --> 31:42.335
Oh, my God!

31:42.369 --> 31:43.636
You're gonna get
one of those!

31:43.670 --> 31:44.972
SUSAN: No, I'm not!

31:45.672 --> 31:47.274

31:47.307 --> 31:49.142

31:49.176 --> 31:50.643

31:52.045 --> 31:53.213

Susan.

31:53.246 --> 31:55.115
Hey, Patrick.
Yes.

31:55.148 --> 31:57.184
I was given specific
instructions by Elaine

31:57.217 --> 31:58.417
to tailor these
gadgets to you.

31:59.619 --> 32:00.753
SUSAN: Wow. NANCY: Wow,
look at that watch.

32:00.787 --> 32:01.787
These are not yours.

32:01.854 --> 32:02.990
Oh.

32:06.526 --> 32:08.128
Is that a rape whistle?

32:08.161 --> 32:10.430
Elaine wanted you
to only be carrying items

32:10.463 --> 32:13.466
a single woman travelling
through Europe would have.

32:13.500 --> 32:15.035
But she could get that
at any pharmacy.

32:15.068 --> 32:16.903
Not this whistle.

32:16.936 --> 32:18.305
When you blow
through this whistle,

32:18.338 --> 32:20.173
a small, poisonous
dart flies out...

32:20.207 --> 32:22.142
neutralizing your target.

32:22.175 --> 32:25.045
Also, it needs your
fingerprints on it to work.

32:25.078 --> 32:26.879
That is really neat!
Stop it, that's amazing.

32:26.913 --> 32:29.182
That is really super cool!
I love that!

32:29.216 --> 32:31.096
This anti-fungal spray
can freeze and disable...

32:31.784 --> 32:33.320
any security system.

32:33.520 --> 32:35.522
Wow.

32:35.555 --> 32:37.657
That is quite an image to be
carrying all over Europe.

32:37.690 --> 32:39.292
It's also a pepper spray.

32:39.326 --> 32:41.561
Why not just make it
look like pepper spray?

32:41.594 --> 32:43.430
That's a pretty good idea.

32:43.463 --> 32:44.597
Well, next time.

32:44.631 --> 32:46.033
I can wait,

32:46.066 --> 32:48.135
if you want to print up
a new label.

32:48.168 --> 32:50.803
No, I'd have to turn
the printer on again.

32:50.837 --> 32:51.837
I don't really want to.

32:52.573 --> 32:54.475
Each of these
are filled with chloroform.

32:54.508 --> 32:58.079
Wow, that is an unsettling
amount of hemorrhoid wipes.

32:58.112 --> 32:59.847
Makes me kind of wonder...

32:59.880 --> 33:02.250
what, exactly,
is going on back there.

33:02.283 --> 33:03.717
I wouldn't know.
I don't have that problem.

33:03.751 --> 33:05.219
I don't have that problem.

33:05.253 --> 33:07.055

you have been poisoned...

33:07.088 --> 33:08.589

33:13.394 --> 33:15.629
Have I done something
to you to upset you?

33:17.231 --> 33:19.500
Because this is
a peculiar theme.

33:19.533 --> 33:22.670
Finally, every agent gets
a night vision scope...

33:22.703 --> 33:24.305

33:24.338 --> 33:26.774
I have heard about this.
I've been looking...

33:26.807 --> 33:28.342
Oh.
Who's that?

33:28.376 --> 33:30.278
That is Bette Midler
and Barbara Hershey.

33:30.711 --> 33:32.146

33:33.347 --> 33:36.317
How much am I supposed
to like Beaches?

33:36.350 --> 33:38.619

if you have the watch.

33:43.824 --> 33:45.859
No, you're not
gonna get that.

33:45.893 --> 33:48.093
I've already packed your bags.
Hurry up and get dressed.

33:48.829 --> 33:51.499

to the airport immediately.

33:51.532 --> 33:52.933
And may I say...

33:52.966 --> 33:53.934
I think it's very brave
of you to sacrifice

33:53.967 --> 33:55.503
your life for your country.

33:55.536 --> 33:57.705
I'm not sacrifi...

Nope. Oh...

40:50.584 --> 40:52.586
Until he checks in,
there's nothing I can do.

40:52.620 --> 40:54.855
You go make some friends,
and stop stalking me!

40:54.888 --> 40:56.957
Was it your mission
to tip off the target

40:56.990 --> 40:59.459
so he burns everything
in advance?

40:59.493 --> 41:02.262
If so, well done.
Phenomenal job.

41:02.295 --> 41:04.798
I'm sure they got suspicious because they've
been seeing you all over the place!

41:04.832 --> 41:06.033
You're gonna
get yourself killed.

41:06.066 --> 41:07.134
Nothing kills me.

41:07.167 --> 41:10.103
I'm immune to 179
different types of poison.

41:10.137 --> 41:13.140
I know, because I ingested
them all at once...

41:13.173 --> 41:14.675
when I was
deep undercover...

41:14.708 --> 41:17.745
in an underground,
poison-ingesting crime ring.

41:17.778 --> 41:19.479
Wow.
It was like dog fighting.

41:19.513 --> 41:20.881
But instead of dogs fighting,

41:20.914 --> 41:22.816
it was humans
ingesting poison...

41:22.850 --> 41:24.852
and rich people would bet...

41:24.885 --> 41:26.654
whether we would
live or die.

41:26.687 --> 41:29.156
Yeah, I'm having
a hard time with this one.

41:29.189 --> 41:31.424
I died for five minutes,
and then I came back to life.

41:31.458 --> 41:32.893
What's he wear...?

41:32.926 --> 41:34.628
He looks like
he's in the cast of Newsies.

41:34.662 --> 41:36.664
Does Crocker
even know you're here?

41:36.697 --> 41:37.698
I don't need
anyone's permission

41:37.731 --> 41:39.299
to save the country...

41:39.332 --> 41:41.434
and avenge my dear friend
Bradley Fine's death.

41:41.468 --> 41:42.870
You didn't even like him.

41:42.903 --> 41:44.672
You used to call him
"Beverly Whine"!

41:44.705 --> 41:47.240
You had him as Secret Santa
and you gave him tampons!

41:47.274 --> 41:48.508
It's called
the rivalry of men.

41:48.542 --> 41:49.977
You wouldn't understand.

41:50.010 --> 41:52.646
Unless you've got a dong up
underneath that skirt.

41:52.680 --> 41:54.347
That is super rude,
and don't say "dong"...

41:54.381 --> 41:55.783
and don't do that!

41:55.816 --> 41:58.886
Nobody sees me
when I don't want them to.

41:58.919 --> 42:01.054
I move like a fucking shadow.

42:02.355 --> 42:03.824

42:03.857 --> 42:05.492
He's gone all sorts of rogue.

42:05.525 --> 42:07.527
Sharon says he really did quit.
Elaine couldn't stop him.

42:07.561 --> 42:09.062
He's out for blood.

42:09.096 --> 42:11.096
Yeah, real tough guy in his
Louis Vuitton backpack.

42:14.501 --> 42:15.803
Nancy, do you see that?

42:15.836 --> 42:17.204
It's the man from the fire.

42:18.471 --> 42:19.573
I'm following him.

42:19.607 --> 42:21.642
Oh. Exciting!

42:21.675 --> 42:23.243
And I'm following you,
following him,

42:23.276 --> 42:24.544
so I'm having
quite a day, here.

42:30.984 --> 42:33.420
Do you think Ford's
leading him into a trap?

42:33.453 --> 42:35.555
Idiot doesn't even know
he's being followed.

42:39.292 --> 42:40.994
He's meeting
with some woman.

42:41.028 --> 42:43.230
I don't recognize her. You
have any idea who she is?

42:43.263 --> 42:44.464
No, it's hard to make out.

42:44.497 --> 42:45.497
Can you get any closer?

42:49.770 --> 42:51.071
Nancy, our guy
just switched out

42:51.104 --> 42:52.264
Ford's backpack.
It's a setup.

42:54.374 --> 42:55.575
Uh...

42:55.609 --> 42:56.810
I gotta go warn him!

42:56.844 --> 42:58.511

42:58.545 --> 43:00.513
Look out!
I gotta get through!

I left my baby in the shop!

43:02.115 --> 43:04.484

Let me through, I'm sick!

43:04.517 --> 43:06.854
Susan, tell them
you've shat your pants.

43:06.887 --> 43:07.921

out of your way, for sure.

Once, I asked someone
for a Tylenol,

01:00:44.846 --> 01:00:47.015
and they gave me
a Tylenol PM.

01:00:47.048 --> 01:00:48.888
I'm not sure what
their intentions were, but...

01:00:53.554 --> 01:00:54.756
It seems
they may have found him.

01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:56.309
Would you come with me
to identify him?

01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:58.693
Yes. Of course.

01:00:58.727 --> 01:00:59.928
I'm happy to help.

01:01:04.766 --> 01:01:06.267
(SOFTLY) Holy shit.

01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:13.942
My friend here
said she saw you

01:01:13.975 --> 01:01:15.643
put something in my drink.

01:01:15.676 --> 01:01:17.345
I don't know
any of you people. Okay?

01:01:17.378 --> 01:01:19.113
I'm just in Rome
on business.

01:01:19.147 --> 01:01:21.482
I was about to head back
to my hotel and go to sleep.

01:01:21.515 --> 01:01:25.086
Perfect. Just in time
for a nightcap.

01:01:25.119 --> 01:01:26.420
Apparently, there's nothing
wrong with it.

01:01:26.454 --> 01:01:27.454
I don't want your drink.

01:01:31.592 --> 01:01:32.592
(INAUDIBLE)

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:41.102
Fuck you, Rayna.

01:01:43.471 --> 01:01:44.773
Mmm. Scrumptious.

01:01:46.207 --> 01:01:48.042
So, joke's on you.

01:01:52.146 --> 01:01:53.447
(CHOKING) Fuck you!

01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:57.385
Fuck you!

01:01:59.754 --> 01:02:00.922
(GURGLING)

01:02:21.375 --> 01:02:22.610
How long was I out?

01:02:22.643 --> 01:02:24.312
You fainted just long enough
for us to laugh at you.

01:02:24.345 --> 01:02:25.847
What happened?

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:26.881
It was all a dream.

01:02:28.182 --> 01:02:30.084
I'm just kidding.
A man's throat dissolved.

01:02:30.118 --> 01:02:32.286
Sorry, I'm not usually,
you know...

01:02:34.322 --> 01:02:35.957
Oh, thank you. That's...

01:02:37.425 --> 01:02:39.393
surprisingly polite.

01:02:39.427 --> 01:02:40.995
Sorry about that.

01:02:41.029 --> 01:02:43.064
I've seen a lot of things
in my day. I just haven't...

01:02:43.097 --> 01:02:45.599
I have never seen that,
exactly.

01:02:45.633 --> 01:02:48.002
Penny, do you feel the need

01:02:48.036 --> 01:02:49.596
to tell anybody about
what you just saw?

01:02:53.074 --> 01:02:54.575
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

01:02:54.608 --> 01:02:57.278
That asshole
got what he deserved.

01:02:57.311 --> 01:02:59.780
I knew from the second
I saw him, I thought...

01:02:59.814 --> 01:03:01.214
"That guy doesn't
deserve a throat."

01:03:01.582 --> 01:03:02.884
So, good on you.

01:03:05.186 --> 01:03:08.022
I would like to take you
to dinner to say thank you.

01:03:08.056 --> 01:03:10.291
And we must discuss
this hideous dress.

01:03:10.324 --> 01:03:11.993
It's just hysterical.

01:03:12.026 --> 01:03:15.263
Oh, good,
that's what I was hoping for.

01:03:15.796 --> 01:03:18.432
And by the way...

01:03:18.466 --> 01:03:20.434
Hristo was supposed to be
looking after me at the bar...

01:03:20.468 --> 01:03:22.403
and making sure nobody
put anything in my drinks.

01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:27.909
(SIGHS)

01:03:27.942 --> 01:03:29.810
(SIGHS) They'll give him
a talking-to.

01:03:29.844 --> 01:03:32.780
Seems fair.
Maybe dock him a day's wage.

01:03:32.813 --> 01:03:33.747
(GUNSHOT)
Or shoot him in the head.

01:03:33.781 --> 01:03:34.949
That always works.

01:03:36.417 --> 01:03:37.751
Rome is quite amaz...

01:03:37.785 --> 01:03:38.920
Rome is the worst.
Yes.

01:03:38.953 --> 01:03:40.889
So boring and tacky.

01:03:40.922 --> 01:03:43.958
I'm so glad one of us
finally said it. (LAUGHS)

01:03:43.992 --> 01:03:45.232
You have lipstick
on your teeth.

01:03:45.693 --> 01:03:47.095
Really?

01:03:47.128 --> 01:03:48.528
Looks like you ate
a box of crayons.

01:03:48.662 --> 01:03:49.662
Damn it.

01:03:50.899 --> 01:03:53.001
Here we are.

01:03:53.034 --> 01:03:54.735
These should have been brought
out when we first sat down.

01:03:54.768 --> 01:03:56.637
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

01:03:56.670 --> 01:04:00.008
So far, I'm riddled with
disappointment at the service.

01:04:00.041 --> 01:04:02.476
So sorry.
Signora, I apologize.

01:04:05.779 --> 01:04:07.815
I once saw someone eat...

01:04:07.848 --> 01:04:10.919
one of these before.

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:15.723
This is... strange.

01:04:15.756 --> 01:04:17.591
Do you always tear your food
up into little pieces?

01:04:17.625 --> 01:04:19.260
You look like a squirrel.

01:04:19.293 --> 01:04:21.529
I was just checking
for the consistency.

01:04:23.431 --> 01:04:24.698
Mmm.

01:04:24.732 --> 01:04:26.300
You eat like a baby.

01:04:26.334 --> 01:04:27.468
Thank you.

01:04:27.501 --> 01:04:31.139
So, do you like to have a
look at the wine list?

01:04:31.172 --> 01:04:32.640
Yes. Penny, you can order.

01:04:33.942 --> 01:04:35.076
Okay. Oh!

01:04:35.876 --> 01:04:36.978
Has some heft.

01:04:37.345 --> 01:04:38.412
Okay.

01:04:38.446 --> 01:04:40.915
I'm feeling a red.

01:04:40.949 --> 01:04:42.984
Kind of a red.
I like a lot of noise.

01:04:43.017 --> 01:04:44.585
I like a little bit of...

01:04:44.618 --> 01:04:46.187
kind of a barky finish.

01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:47.621
I tend to like a white...

01:04:47.655 --> 01:04:50.724
with the grit of a hummus...

01:04:50.758 --> 01:04:53.227
that's, of course,
been thinned out.

01:04:53.261 --> 01:04:55.930
Just kind of jump up
in the front of your palate...

01:04:55.964 --> 01:04:58.399
and then rip back
and sizzle.

01:04:58.432 --> 01:05:02.336
Almost a mineral
kind of dirt finish...

01:05:02.370 --> 01:05:05.974
if we're having meat. Okay,
here, this is looking...

01:05:06.007 --> 01:05:08.076
promising.
Something with...

01:05:08.109 --> 01:05:10.011
This one has
nice hints of toast...

01:05:10.844 --> 01:05:13.281
and dogwood,
I assume? Hmm?

01:05:13.314 --> 01:05:14.682
Uh...

01:05:14.715 --> 01:05:18.419
I will have
the Sapori e Delizie.

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:20.488
Right.

01:05:20.521 --> 01:05:22.756
That is the name
of this restaurant.

01:05:22.790 --> 01:05:24.292
Yes, I'm aware of that.

01:05:24.325 --> 01:05:26.560
So, why don't you
surprise us...

01:05:26.594 --> 01:05:28.229
with something
that we don't know?

01:05:28.262 --> 01:05:30.064
Like a delicious
bottle of wine.

01:05:30.098 --> 01:05:32.967
Right. Sorry, I will be back
in five minutes, okay?

01:05:33.001 --> 01:05:35.369
So hard to get
good help these days.

01:05:35.403 --> 01:05:37.138
Don't you find that?
I find that.

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:41.675
I know who all
your active agents are.

01:05:43.978 --> 01:05:46.014
Okay, I'm sensing, uh...

01:05:46.914 --> 01:05:48.482
Can I do a little do over?

01:05:49.550 --> 01:05:50.550
I, uh...

01:05:51.319 --> 01:05:53.254
I really don't know
how to order wine.

01:05:53.287 --> 01:05:56.991
I'm from a small town
in Iowa.

01:05:57.025 --> 01:05:58.692
I saved up my money
to come on this Rome trip.

01:05:58.726 --> 01:06:00.594
I had a little jar
on my desk at work...

01:06:00.628 --> 01:06:02.063
and everybody said, "You're
never gonna make enough money."

01:06:02.096 --> 01:06:04.098
But I did, and I'm here.

01:06:04.132 --> 01:06:07.068
And then I meet you,
and I can't afford...

01:06:07.101 --> 01:06:08.536
to eat at a place like this,

01:06:08.569 --> 01:06:10.404
and I'm just trying
to impress you...

01:06:10.438 --> 01:06:12.340
and doing a really
poor job of it.

01:06:13.841 --> 01:06:15.909
I thought as much.

01:06:15.943 --> 01:06:19.047
Your cheap prom dress doesn't
exactly scream sophistication.

01:06:19.413 --> 01:06:20.881
Oh.

01:06:20.914 --> 01:06:23.551
Well, I didn't go to prom,
so maybe it is...

01:06:23.584 --> 01:06:25.153
When I was a little girl
growing up in Bulgaria...

01:06:25.186 --> 01:06:27.421
which is the worst,
by the way.

01:06:27.455 --> 01:06:30.524
Poor people everywhere and
cabbages constantly cooking.

01:06:30.558 --> 01:06:33.094
There was this woman who was
kicked out of her house...

01:06:33.127 --> 01:06:34.895
and she lost
all her money.

01:06:34.928 --> 01:06:36.530
She couldn't even
sell her body.

01:06:36.564 --> 01:06:39.533
So she became a clown
on the streets.

01:06:39.567 --> 01:06:41.835
She would perform all her
tricks standing in mud,

01:06:41.869 --> 01:06:44.072
and just cry and cry.

01:06:45.306 --> 01:06:46.607
You remind me of this woman.

01:06:47.608 --> 01:06:49.443
Oh. Thank you.

01:06:49.477 --> 01:06:52.180
I don't know what it is, but
there's something about you.

01:06:52.213 --> 01:06:55.116
The fainting,
the way you talk...

01:06:55.149 --> 01:06:57.151
your terrible
sense of style.

01:06:57.185 --> 01:06:59.320
I did get this at
quite a lovely...

01:06:59.353 --> 01:07:00.488
It makes me sad
to think of you here

01:07:00.521 --> 01:07:02.890
spending all your
savings on Rome.

01:07:02.923 --> 01:07:05.093
Come on.
We're going to Budapest.

01:07:05.559 --> 01:07:06.727
Budapest?

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:08.129
I have some business
to finish there...

01:07:08.162 --> 01:07:10.131
and you can take my private
jet when we're done...

01:07:10.164 --> 01:07:11.965
anywhere you want to
get home.

01:07:11.999 --> 01:07:13.639
My way of repaying you
for saving my life.

01:07:14.034 --> 01:07:15.236
Okay.

01:07:19.773 --> 01:07:20.773
Is there a problem?

01:07:25.913 --> 01:07:28.182
No. Not at all. Let's go.

01:07:29.617 --> 01:07:31.085
Hey! Wait, what?

01:07:31.119 --> 01:07:32.453
I'm just talking
to the girl!

01:07:32.486 --> 01:07:33.846
Okay, okay.
Let's not make a scene.

01:07:34.588 --> 01:07:36.324
Let me just
get my room key out...

01:07:36.357 --> 01:07:38.459
and I'll grab a bag
and pack my things.

01:07:38.492 --> 01:07:40.828
It's Susan.
She's sending a code.

01:07:40.861 --> 01:07:41.829
RAYNA: No, they can
fly you back later.

01:07:41.862 --> 01:07:43.297
"Shut...

01:07:43.331 --> 01:07:44.665
And if the rest of your clothes
look like that dress...

01:07:44.698 --> 01:07:46.066
"...down...

01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:46.900
...I can send someone
to burn them for you.

01:07:46.934 --> 01:07:48.269
Ha-ha.

01:07:48.302 --> 01:07:49.670
"...the power."
Quite a zinger!

01:07:52.806 --> 01:07:54.342
Shut down the power
to the Casino Di Rome.

01:07:54.375 --> 01:07:55.375
What?

01:07:56.744 --> 01:07:59.046
Shut the entire bloody
grid down, then! Now!

01:07:59.079 --> 01:08:00.080
That would be great.

01:08:03.016 --> 01:08:04.585
(GRUNTING)

01:08:04.618 --> 01:08:06.899
MAN: Everybody, please remain
calm and stay where you are.

01:08:07.421 --> 01:08:08.421
(GRUNTS)

01:08:14.962 --> 01:08:16.430
Oh, no!
What's happening?

01:08:16.863 --> 01:08:17.863
(RAYNA SCREAMS)

01:08:25.773 --> 01:08:26.874
(MOUTHING) I've got this.

01:08:28.142 --> 01:08:30.178
What the fuck just happened?

01:08:31.712 --> 01:08:32.912
God damn it.

01:08:32.946 --> 01:08:34.482
Oh, my God! Rayna.

01:08:34.515 --> 01:08:35.816
Thank God
your hair broke your fall.

01:08:35.849 --> 01:08:37.451
I don't know what happened.

01:08:37.484 --> 01:08:39.487
The lights were going out, and I
don't know if it's a robbery.

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:42.356
Two of your guys slammed
into me and took you down.

01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:44.591
I think one of them
touched my bottom.

01:08:44.625 --> 01:08:46.705
I don't know which one,
but I definitely felt a hand.

01:08:47.295 --> 01:08:49.363
Are they gonna be okay?

01:08:49.397 --> 01:08:50.497
I wouldn't
worry about them.

01:08:50.531 --> 01:08:52.300
Their fate has just
been sealed.

01:08:54.268 --> 01:08:57.270
Sorry. I'll let you go.

01:08:57.305 --> 01:08:58.305
Shame on you!

01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:07.881
Wow.

01:09:07.915 --> 01:09:10.951
This is a really jazzy plane.

01:09:10.984 --> 01:09:12.620
Is this yours?

01:09:12.653 --> 01:09:13.720
It was my father's.

01:09:14.822 --> 01:09:16.590
You've never been
on a private jet before?

01:09:16.624 --> 01:09:17.625
Oh, no.

01:09:18.626 --> 01:09:20.728
I did get upgraded
to premium economy once...

01:09:20.761 --> 01:09:23.130
which was pretty plush.

01:09:23.162 --> 01:09:25.633
Premium economy.

01:09:25.666 --> 01:09:27.201
Sounds like a pen
for dirty animals.

01:09:27.234 --> 01:09:28.935
Yeah, probably.

01:09:28.969 --> 01:09:31.738
But it was not
quite like this.

01:09:31.772 --> 01:09:33.173
Thank you.

01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:36.310
Why are you being
so nice to me?

01:09:36.344 --> 01:09:37.944
Can't just be because
I remind you

01:09:37.978 --> 01:09:39.846
of some sad Bulgarian clown.

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:41.249
You remind me of my mother.

01:09:41.782 --> 01:09:42.782
Oh.

01:09:43.551 --> 01:09:45.286
Really?

01:09:45.319 --> 01:09:48.188
You know that you and I
are pretty close in age.

01:09:48.221 --> 01:09:49.890
You're funny.

01:09:49.923 --> 01:09:51.225
It's the Bulgarian
clown in you.

01:09:51.259 --> 01:09:52.960
Okay.
She was marvelous.

01:09:52.993 --> 01:09:54.795
But she was different.

01:09:54.828 --> 01:09:55.929
Eccentric, like you are.

01:09:55.963 --> 01:09:57.365
Oh.

01:09:57.398 --> 01:09:58.432
The moment I saw you
standing there

01:09:58.466 --> 01:09:59.600
in that abortion
of a dress...

01:09:59.633 --> 01:10:00.801
Ah... Come on.

01:10:00.834 --> 01:10:02.536
...it was as if to say...

01:10:02.570 --> 01:10:04.930
"This is what I've got, world.
It's hideous, but it's mine."

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:08.141
This was her.
(GASPS)

01:10:08.175 --> 01:10:09.710
Oh, wow.

01:10:09.743 --> 01:10:11.245
Hey, how'd you get
that picture of me?

01:10:11.279 --> 01:10:12.746
I look amazing.

01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:14.748
Hello, doppelganger.

01:10:14.782 --> 01:10:16.917
She was the only person
I could ever trust.

01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:19.853
Well, here's to your mom.

01:10:19.887 --> 01:10:21.955
To my mother. And to you.

01:10:21.989 --> 01:10:23.557
And here's to you.

01:10:23.591 --> 01:10:26.260
You may never
be as wise as an owl...

01:10:26.294 --> 01:10:28.296
but you'll always
be a hoot to me.

01:10:29.229 --> 01:10:31.499
What a stupid fucking
retarded toast.

01:10:31.532 --> 01:10:32.966
You're delightful.
As are you.

01:10:35.569 --> 01:10:36.737
Mmm.

01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:39.740
Now, where did you say
we were headed?

01:10:42.743 --> 01:10:43.677
(CLEARS THROAT)

01:10:43.711 --> 01:10:44.711
Headed?

01:10:45.779 --> 01:10:47.681
Did you say where?

01:10:48.015 --> 01:10:49.783
Oh, God.

01:10:49.817 --> 01:10:51.385
PATRICK: If you ever feel like
you have been poisoned...

01:10:51.419 --> 01:10:52.920
chew one of these.

01:10:52.953 --> 01:10:53.953
Chew one of these.

01:11:09.303 --> 01:11:10.804
What happened?

01:11:10.838 --> 01:11:12.172
I've never seen somebody

01:11:12.205 --> 01:11:13.874
dive for
stool softener before.

01:11:13.907 --> 01:11:15.943
That's one thing
that happened.

01:11:15.976 --> 01:11:16.976
What did you do?

01:11:18.011 --> 01:11:19.212
Did you drug me?

01:11:19.246 --> 01:11:20.714
Of course I did.

01:11:20.748 --> 01:11:22.350
I told you,
I can't trust anybody.

01:11:22.383 --> 01:11:23.703
I had to look
through your things.

01:11:23.817 --> 01:11:25.786
Anyway, tell me...

01:11:25.819 --> 01:11:26.920
are your hemorrhoids
particularly large,

01:11:26.954 --> 01:11:27.954
or just tenacious?

01:11:28.356 --> 01:11:29.923
Stop texting!

01:11:29.957 --> 01:11:31.892
I'm not texting,
if you must know.

01:11:31.925 --> 01:11:34.261
I'm playing Candy Crush
and I just made level 95.

01:11:34.294 --> 01:11:35.262
God, that is so rude!

01:11:35.295 --> 01:11:36.364
(GUNSHOT)

01:11:39.433 --> 01:11:41.134
Jesus, Colin,
what the fuck are you doing?

01:11:41.168 --> 01:11:43.571
I'm sorry, Rayna, but there's
been a change of plans.

01:11:43.604 --> 01:11:45.072
Who paid you off, Colin?

01:11:45.105 --> 01:11:47.240
Colin hasn't worked here for,
like, eight months.

01:11:47.274 --> 01:11:48.442
I'm Fredrick.

01:11:48.476 --> 01:11:49.643
Is that why
you're doing this?

01:11:49.677 --> 01:11:51.244
Because I don't remember
your fucking name?

01:11:51.278 --> 01:11:52.546
Let's just say
there's some people

01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:54.147
who really want
what you're selling.

01:11:54.181 --> 01:11:55.949
You don't have to do this.

01:11:55.983 --> 01:11:58.251
I can give you a very
comfortable life, Col...

01:11:58.285 --> 01:11:59.887
Um...

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:01.288
You forgot my name again,
didn't you?

01:12:01.321 --> 01:12:02.322
No, I didn't.
Yeah.

01:12:02.356 --> 01:12:04.291
It's...

01:12:04.324 --> 01:12:05.926
Don't say fucking Colin.

01:12:05.959 --> 01:12:08.496
Fuck! I don't give a shit
what your name is.

01:12:08.529 --> 01:12:09.863
You're the fucking help!

01:12:09.897 --> 01:12:12.500
Nice try, Colin... but Stan
and I already sold it to...

01:12:12.533 --> 01:12:13.834
It's Fredrick!
(GUNSHOT)

01:12:13.867 --> 01:12:14.867
Fredrick!

01:12:18.372 --> 01:12:19.941
Sorry, lady, but they only
paid me for one...

01:12:19.974 --> 01:12:20.974
Ow!

01:12:26.981 --> 01:12:28.016
(SCREAMS)

01:12:28.049 --> 01:12:29.049
Come on!

01:12:31.553 --> 01:12:33.755
Rayna! Go to the cockpit
and level us out!

01:12:33.788 --> 01:12:35.428
Like I know how to fly
a fucking airplane!

01:12:37.992 --> 01:12:38.993
That was weird.

01:12:39.327 --> 01:12:40.429
Ah!

01:12:44.899 --> 01:12:46.835
Blow that thing
all you want, lady.

01:12:46.868 --> 01:12:49.303
Yeah? Why don't
you blow me, Colin.

01:12:49.337 --> 01:12:51.540
Ow! It's Fredrick.

01:12:57.211 --> 01:12:58.211

Oh, for fuck's sake!

01:13:35.116 --> 01:13:36.184
I got it.

01:13:36.217 --> 01:13:37.217
I know what to do.

01:13:41.089 --> 01:13:42.957
Are you okay?
No!

01:13:42.991 --> 01:13:44.993
I've got a dead man's
head up my ass.

01:13:45.026 --> 01:13:46.127
This one's for Fine.

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:47.160
Downdraft!

01:13:48.930 --> 01:13:50.131
Not again!

01:13:50.164 --> 01:13:52.066
Do you have any idea
what you're fucking doing?

01:13:52.967 --> 01:13:54.268
(GROANS)

01:13:54.302 --> 01:13:55.670

are so sensitive.

(FARTING)
Oh, God.

01:13:57.672 --> 01:14:00.374
One of these dead fuckers
just shit his pants.

01:14:00.408 --> 01:14:01.408
Okay, wait a minute.

01:14:03.144 --> 01:14:04.278
I got it.

01:14:04.312 --> 01:14:05.379
I think I got... Okay.

01:14:05.413 --> 01:14:06.515
Okay.

01:14:10.051 --> 01:14:13.522
Good thing I learned to use
that flight simulator app, huh?

01:14:13.555 --> 01:14:16.057
Congratulations,
Penny Morgan.

01:14:16.090 --> 01:14:17.659
You just blew your cover.

01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:21.830
Now put the plane
on autopilot and get up.

01:14:25.567 --> 01:14:27.802
Any bullshit, and I'll
blow your CIA brains

01:14:27.836 --> 01:14:29.504
all over that control panel.

01:14:29.538 --> 01:14:30.872
I know what
you're thinking.

01:14:31.472 --> 01:14:32.674
And you're wrong.

01:14:34.008 --> 01:14:36.210
My real name is...

01:14:36.244 --> 01:14:38.146
Did you come up with
your spy name yet? No.

01:14:38.179 --> 01:14:39.313
Mine would be...

01:14:39.347 --> 01:14:41.049
Amber Valentine.

01:14:41.082 --> 01:14:42.684
What are you, a porn star?

01:14:43.618 --> 01:14:45.754
You're fucking
hilarious, huh?

01:14:45.787 --> 01:14:47.421
I'm a private bodyguard,

01:14:47.455 --> 01:14:48.657
and your father hired me
to protect you.

01:14:48.690 --> 01:14:52.026
Bodyguard? You? Please.

01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:54.162
That's funny, because the
way I see it, without me...

01:14:54.195 --> 01:14:56.397
you would currently be crashed
in the Alps right now.

01:14:56.430 --> 01:14:57.699
Or you'd be
laying in a morgue

01:14:57.732 --> 01:14:58.900
with a hole burned
in your throat.

01:14:58.933 --> 01:15:01.570
You little spoiled
piece of shit.

01:15:01.603 --> 01:15:04.706
Why would my father hire
somebody like you?

01:15:05.273 --> 01:15:07.408
Because he trusted me.

01:15:07.441 --> 01:15:08.543
And for whatever
fucking reason,

01:15:08.577 --> 01:15:10.712
he loved you.

01:15:10.745 --> 01:15:12.881
Didn't even want you to know
I was watching you.

01:15:12.914 --> 01:15:14.816
So he was the one
that made me come up

01:15:14.849 --> 01:15:16.985
with this whole loser
Penny Morgan bullshit.

01:15:17.018 --> 01:15:19.420

just like my dead mama.

01:15:22.456 --> 01:15:25.660
I look anything
like that fucking beast.

01:15:25.694 --> 01:15:27.696
No wonder your father
never had the son he wanted.

01:15:27.729 --> 01:15:29.631
You fuck that monster once...

01:15:29.664 --> 01:15:31.966
and you just drop
the fucking mic and walk out.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.302
Fuck you. Everything
you've said is a lie.

01:15:34.335 --> 01:15:35.870
Oh.

01:15:35.904 --> 01:15:37.939
What happened? Did I hit
a little sore spot?

01:15:37.972 --> 01:15:39.874
Yeah, he always wanted a
son, and you knew it.

01:15:41.175 --> 01:15:43.311
Look, he wanted you
to take over the business.

01:15:43.344 --> 01:15:46.014
He was just afraid you were
gonna get yourself killed.

01:15:46.047 --> 01:15:48.316
So if you wanna live, and you
wanna unload that bomb...

01:15:48.349 --> 01:15:49.851
you stick with me.

01:15:49.884 --> 01:15:52.353
And if you got
a problem with that...

01:15:52.386 --> 01:15:53.655
you know what you
can do, Rayna?

01:15:56.224 --> 01:15:57.726
You and your bullshit accent

01:15:57.759 --> 01:16:00.028
can land this fucking plane
by yourselves.

01:16:01.963 --> 01:16:04.966
Okay, bodyguard.

01:16:04.999 --> 01:16:07.201
But if I find out you're lying
to me about any of this...

01:16:07.235 --> 01:16:10.238
I'll show you ways to die
you never even dreamed of.

01:16:12.073 --> 01:16:15.309
Now, let's go to Budapest.
I need a fucking drink.

01:16:15.343 --> 01:16:16.678

Don't talk to me.
You're not my friend.

01:16:47.141 --> 01:16:48.176
Get away from me.

Move. Move! I got it.

01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:53.948
So, what's the plan?
Who are we meeting?

01:16:53.982 --> 01:16:55.950
You're my bodyguard,
not my business partner...

01:16:55.984 --> 01:16:57.819
so just focus
on guarding my body.

01:16:57.852 --> 01:16:59.520
So not knowing
who we're meeting tonight

01:16:59.553 --> 01:17:00.588
is gonna make me
extra effective.

01:17:00.621 --> 01:17:01.923
That's okay. I get it.

01:17:01.956 --> 01:17:03.391
I got shit to do.
You'll probably be fine.

01:17:03.424 --> 01:17:05.393
Why don't I go get you
a nice dress to be buried in?

if you must know.

01:17:11.165 --> 01:17:12.633
If they don't top
the current offer,

01:17:12.667 --> 01:17:13.827
the sale
will happen tomorrow.

01:17:14.302 --> 01:17:15.303

I don't like his face.

of your face!

cut your dick off

to your forehead...

Yeah? Don't be afraid
to hit water yourself.

01:18:15.429 --> 01:18:17.531
You smell like a dead hooker
that washed up on the beach...

01:18:17.565 --> 01:18:18.833
then roasted in the sun
for a week

01:18:18.867 --> 01:18:20.134
before anybody found
her body.

01:18:20.168 --> 01:18:22.136
Okay. You need
to take it way down.

01:18:22.170 --> 01:18:23.571
I'm sorry, that's too much.
Okay, that was too much.

01:18:23.604 --> 01:18:24.939
Jeez!
Too much.

01:18:24.973 --> 01:18:25.973
God.

01:18:32.947 --> 01:18:34.048
What are you staring at?

01:18:35.549 --> 01:18:37.218
I will destroy you.

01:18:37.251 --> 01:18:38.619
And then after
I'm done destroying you,

01:18:38.652 --> 01:18:40.789
I'll take a picture
of what's left...

01:18:40.822 --> 01:18:42.957
of your body, and I'm gonna
text it to your mother.

01:18:42.991 --> 01:18:44.893
With a little note that says
his last words were...

01:18:44.926 --> 01:18:47.195
"My mother was terrible.
You did this to me."

01:18:47.228 --> 01:18:48.329
That's so fucking mean.

01:18:48.362 --> 01:18:49.597
Yeah, I'm so fucking mean.

01:18:49.630 --> 01:18:50.664
You're just
figuring that out?

01:18:50.698 --> 01:18:51.866
Give me your coat.

01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:53.567
This is a man's coat.

01:18:53.601 --> 01:18:55.603
Yeah, but I don't
see a man, do I?

01:18:55.636 --> 01:18:57.371
I see a reject from
The Sound of Music.

01:18:57.405 --> 01:19:00.608
It was my mother's coat,
but she's very masculine.

01:19:00.641 --> 01:19:03.477
You look like ABBA took a shit
and put a trench coat on it.

01:19:03.511 --> 01:19:05.379
Well, I won't
give it to you.

01:19:05.413 --> 01:19:06.414
I've been in this dress
for 12 fucking hours.

01:19:06.447 --> 01:19:07.447
Give me your coat.

01:19:07.548 --> 01:19:09.050
No.

01:19:09.083 --> 01:19:12.120
Yeah. No, I won't give...
This is my coat.

01:19:12.153 --> 01:19:13.855
I'm gonna reach through
your fucking body...

01:19:13.888 --> 01:19:15.790
and rip out your back
like a fucking werewolf.

01:19:16.424 --> 01:19:17.992
Without tearing the jacket.

01:19:18.026 --> 01:19:19.527
Just so I can
wear your jacket,

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.195
and give you a final
"Fuck you."

01:19:21.229 --> 01:19:22.696
Oh, no, you won't.

01:19:22.730 --> 01:19:24.132
I'm gonna take
that fucking coat.

01:19:24.165 --> 01:19:25.366
(GROANING)

01:19:25.399 --> 01:19:27.501
I warned you, you Swedish
gummy fish motherfucker!

01:19:27.535 --> 01:19:28.535
ANTON: Ouch!

01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:33.975
Oh, my God.

01:19:34.742 --> 01:19:35.944
Oh, my God.

01:19:37.145 --> 01:19:38.813
Nance?
Oh, my God, Susan!

01:19:38.847 --> 01:19:41.215
Hello. Hello?

01:19:41.249 --> 01:19:42.550
Just say something
to me, please.

01:19:42.583 --> 01:19:44.118
Susan? Anything.

01:19:44.152 --> 01:19:45.954
I cannot handle this,
Susan!

01:19:45.987 --> 01:19:47.355
There is nothing
in real life

01:19:47.388 --> 01:19:48.456
that someone could
do to a spy...

01:19:48.489 --> 01:19:50.658
that is filthier
or more upsetting

01:19:50.691 --> 01:19:52.093
than what my brain
will cook up right now.

01:19:52.126 --> 01:19:54.795
So save me from myself,
Susan!

01:19:54.829 --> 01:19:55.897
Because you know
what's going to happen.

01:19:55.930 --> 01:19:57.565
I'm gonna get chattier,
aren't I?

01:19:57.598 --> 01:20:00.001
Did you know that you can't
ever change having big pores?

01:20:00.034 --> 01:20:02.837
Oh, my God, Nancy,
you are driving me nuts!

01:20:02.871 --> 01:20:05.039
I couldn't talk because I was in
an elevator filled with people.

01:20:05.073 --> 01:20:07.241
You're all right.
Oh, thank God.

01:20:07.275 --> 01:20:09.878
You disappeared for 12 hours.
We didn't know what happened!

01:20:09.911 --> 01:20:12.246
I had to take out my earpiece
and my camera.

01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:13.920
Rayna's on to our agents
and she was gonna

01:20:13.948 --> 01:20:15.616
spot my equipment
from a mile away.

01:20:15.649 --> 01:20:17.318
You're with Rayna?

01:20:17.351 --> 01:20:19.954
You're not supposed to be
within a mile away of her.

01:20:19.988 --> 01:20:21.489
Nancy, I know,
but I'm in deep

01:20:21.522 --> 01:20:23.024
and I'm getting
such good intel.

01:20:23.057 --> 01:20:24.392
Please,
I just need to remain

01:20:24.425 --> 01:20:26.360
on radio silence
just a little bit longer.

01:20:26.394 --> 01:20:27.828
Well, don't worry,
because I'll be able

01:20:27.862 --> 01:20:29.130
to keep a better eye
on you now.

01:20:29.163 --> 01:20:30.403
What are you
talking about? How?

01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:33.968
What are you doing here?

01:20:34.002 --> 01:20:35.636
Elaine wanted to know exactly
what you were up to...

01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:38.172
so I tracked your earpiece.
They sent me here to find you.

01:20:38.206 --> 01:20:39.473
They sent you?

01:20:39.507 --> 01:20:40.909
I'm as unknown as you are,

01:20:40.942 --> 01:20:42.110
so they thought
my cover was safe.

01:20:42.143 --> 01:20:43.411
Did they give you
an identity?

01:20:43.878 --> 01:20:45.413
It's so cool.

01:20:45.446 --> 01:20:47.548
I said I wanted to be
Amber Valentine... What?

01:20:47.581 --> 01:20:49.083
...and they let me use it.

01:20:49.117 --> 01:20:50.251
I don't know why you got
to pick your identity.

01:20:50.284 --> 01:20:51.752
I had to go
as a freaking cat lady.

01:20:51.785 --> 01:20:52.887
RAYNA: Amber!
BOTH: Yes?

01:20:52.921 --> 01:20:54.255
Who is this?

01:20:54.288 --> 01:20:55.823
I'm sorry. I didn't know
the police were here.

01:20:55.856 --> 01:20:57.625
This is my colleague,
detective.

01:20:57.658 --> 01:20:58.893
The one I fucking
told you about.

01:20:58.927 --> 01:21:00.228
No, you didn't.

01:21:00.261 --> 01:21:01.930
Yes, I did, Helen Keller!

01:21:01.963 --> 01:21:03.164
You're both named Amber?

01:21:04.232 --> 01:21:06.534
What did I tell you
about talking to me?

01:21:06.567 --> 01:21:08.702
Nothing. You just said
nothing about talking.

01:21:08.736 --> 01:21:10.271
You want me to have Cagney

01:21:10.304 --> 01:21:12.073
and fucking Lacey
explain it to you?

01:21:12.106 --> 01:21:13.774
Cagney's coming down
your fucking throat.

01:21:13.807 --> 01:21:15.143
Lacey, she's gonna
come up your ass.

01:21:15.176 --> 01:21:16.978
I'm gonna meet them
in the fucking middle...

01:21:17.011 --> 01:21:18.712
and play your heart
like a fucking accordion.

01:21:18.746 --> 01:21:20.748
I'm gonna pump
that shit until it pops.

01:21:20.781 --> 01:21:21.916
You Swedish bitch.

01:21:21.950 --> 01:21:23.517
You wouldn't dare.

01:21:23.551 --> 01:21:25.753
You gonna cry, you little
Swiss fucking pussy?

01:21:25.786 --> 01:21:27.155
I'm not gonna cry.
You're crying now!

01:21:27.188 --> 01:21:28.389
I'm not!

01:21:28.422 --> 01:21:31.225
It's so fucking hot!

01:21:31.259 --> 01:21:33.461
You know, just, let's leave
Anton alone for now.

01:21:33.494 --> 01:21:34.562
Please.

01:21:34.595 --> 01:21:35.595
What's your name?

01:21:36.230 --> 01:21:37.365
Susan Cooper.
What?

01:21:38.366 --> 01:21:41.302
Sorry, it came out.
What did I...

01:21:41.335 --> 01:21:42.836
She's not supposed to
fucking say her real name.

01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:44.638
She's one of my best. She's
highly fucking skilled.

01:21:44.672 --> 01:21:45.940
Very skilled.

01:21:45.974 --> 01:21:48.142
At what? Getting things
out of a high cupboard?

01:21:48.176 --> 01:21:50.078
(LAUGHS)
Don't do that.

01:21:50.111 --> 01:21:52.613
That's very good!
Because I'm tall.

01:21:52.646 --> 01:21:54.949
Weirdly, I'm not very good
at reaching high things.

01:21:54.983 --> 01:21:57.543
A doctor once said to me I have
the muscle capacity of an infant.

01:21:57.618 --> 01:21:58.752
My arms are like two noodles.

to safety, now!

01:22:10.931 --> 01:22:12.133
I've got her.

01:22:12.166 --> 01:22:13.166
Go!

01:22:17.538 --> 01:22:18.538

This guy is driving crazy!
I can't keep up with him!

01:23:04.085 --> 01:23:05.119
Wait a minute.

01:23:07.121 --> 01:23:08.156

01:23:09.357 --> 01:23:11.192

under here!

quite a hearty lasagna.

if there's a Popeyes Chicken

it was me, either.

to watch her.

(SCREAMS)

01:36:04.432 --> 01:36:05.432
Oh...

01:36:06.367 --> 01:36:07.368
That's clean through.

01:36:08.837 --> 01:36:09.971
Thanks for your weapon.

01:36:10.004 --> 01:36:11.272
It's been inside you,

01:36:11.305 --> 01:36:12.945
so I don't think
it should go inside me...

01:36:23.818 --> 01:36:25.286
Get up. Get up!

01:36:28.456 --> 01:36:31.059
You are under arrest
by Susan Cooper...

01:36:31.092 --> 01:36:32.652
and the government
of the United States.

01:36:42.703 --> 01:36:44.305
Rayna, how did you do that?

01:36:44.338 --> 01:36:45.338
I didn't.

01:36:45.673 --> 01:36:46.673
He did.

01:36:54.182 --> 01:36:55.182
Hello, Coop.

01:36:58.519 --> 01:36:59.587
Fine?

01:36:59.620 --> 01:37:00.620
Ow...

01:37:01.322 --> 01:37:02.523
FINE: Hey.

01:37:03.491 --> 01:37:04.558
Coop.

01:37:17.505 --> 01:37:18.572
Wake up!

01:37:19.573 --> 01:37:21.675
Did you have a nice nap?

01:37:21.709 --> 01:37:23.511
You were snoring
very loudly.

01:37:23.544 --> 01:37:24.845
That's just really
not the most

01:37:24.879 --> 01:37:26.780
upsetting news right now.

01:37:26.814 --> 01:37:28.950
My father used to
bring people here.

01:37:28.983 --> 01:37:31.552
Did he also make you dress
like a slutty dolphin trainer?

01:37:31.585 --> 01:37:33.254
He'd starve them...

01:37:33.287 --> 01:37:34.688
torture them.

01:37:34.722 --> 01:37:36.157
You name it.

01:37:36.190 --> 01:37:37.625
But he especially
didn't like it

01:37:37.658 --> 01:37:39.027
when people lied to him.

01:37:40.028 --> 01:37:41.595
Not that I bought it.

01:37:41.629 --> 01:37:42.663
You knew?

01:37:42.696 --> 01:37:44.132
Of course I knew.

01:37:44.165 --> 01:37:46.800
I told you, you were better
off in the basement, Coop.

01:37:46.834 --> 01:37:48.202
You could have
avoided all of this.

01:37:48.236 --> 01:37:49.837
And what, Fine?

01:37:49.870 --> 01:37:51.572
Now you're a nuclear
black marketer?

01:37:51.605 --> 01:37:52.640
A terrorist?

01:37:52.673 --> 01:37:54.342
No...

01:37:55.409 --> 01:37:57.078
He's just fucking me.

01:38:04.752 --> 01:38:05.920
You're a loud kisser.

01:38:06.988 --> 01:38:08.957
Excuse me?
You're a loud kisser.

01:38:08.990 --> 01:38:11.192
And it's gross
and unappealing.

01:38:11.225 --> 01:38:12.726
You look like some
old, toothless woman

01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:14.062
sucking the jelly
out of a donut.

01:38:15.529 --> 01:38:16.998
Hey, what's it like
sleeping with the man

01:38:17.031 --> 01:38:18.566
that killed your father?

01:38:18.599 --> 01:38:19.599
Nice try, Coop.

01:38:21.202 --> 01:38:22.971
She already knows
it was Cress.

01:38:23.171 --> 01:38:24.305
Ah.

01:38:24.338 --> 01:38:25.773
Okay.

01:38:25.806 --> 01:38:29.143
You've probably always been in
love with him, haven't you?

01:38:29.177 --> 01:38:31.445
Talking in his ear...

01:38:31.479 --> 01:38:34.248
hoping eventually one day
he'll fall in love with you.

01:38:34.615 --> 01:38:36.050
(CHUCKLES)

01:38:36.084 --> 01:38:38.687
Poor little,
pathetic Susan Coleman.

01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:40.122
That's not my last name,

01:38:40.155 --> 01:38:41.755
so it's really not much
of a burn, is it?

01:38:41.790 --> 01:38:42.824
Cooping.

01:38:42.857 --> 01:38:43.892
No.

01:38:43.925 --> 01:38:45.160
Croupon.

01:38:45.194 --> 01:38:47.162
Are you thinking "Groupon"?

01:38:47.196 --> 01:38:48.730
No, my name's not "Groupon."

01:38:48.763 --> 01:38:50.532
Croupe.
Keep going.

01:38:50.565 --> 01:38:51.967
Kapowski.

01:38:52.001 --> 01:38:53.535
That's getting
further from it!

01:38:53.568 --> 01:38:56.738
Well, whatever the fuck it is,
let's just call you dead.

01:38:56.771 --> 01:38:58.307
Hey, baby?

01:38:58.340 --> 01:38:59.441
I thought we were gonna hang
on to her till tonight.

01:38:59.474 --> 01:39:01.010
I changed my mind.

01:39:04.313 --> 01:39:05.347
Goodbye.

01:39:05.981 --> 01:39:06.982
(CLICKS)
(GASPS)

01:39:07.916 --> 01:39:09.218
(CHUCKLES)

01:39:10.219 --> 01:39:11.686
Like I'd waste
a bullet on you.

01:39:13.755 --> 01:39:14.990
Put her in the room.

01:39:24.199 --> 01:39:25.199
Ah!

01:39:33.475 --> 01:39:34.475
Hey, Aldo.

01:39:35.644 --> 01:39:37.846
Hello, captured lady.

01:39:37.879 --> 01:39:39.214
I failed.

01:39:40.649 --> 01:39:41.683
I failed the mission.

01:39:42.684 --> 01:39:44.686
Fine is alive...

01:39:44.719 --> 01:39:46.521
and he's a traitor.

01:39:46.555 --> 01:39:48.190
Don't be downhearted.

01:39:50.092 --> 01:39:52.461
My mama said to me...

01:39:52.494 --> 01:39:57.566
"Aldo,
life is full of sorrow...

01:39:57.599 --> 01:39:59.068
"and surprises.

01:40:00.102 --> 01:40:05.740
"But, a magnificent
pair of bosoms...

01:40:06.875 --> 01:40:09.078
"will..."

01:40:11.913 --> 01:40:13.215
Good story.

01:40:25.594 --> 01:40:27.129
Susan.

01:40:27.162 --> 01:40:28.663
Get away from me.
No, listen.

01:40:28.697 --> 01:40:30.099
I haven't got much time.

01:40:30.132 --> 01:40:31.333
Why'd you do it, Fine?

01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:34.303
This was my only way in.

01:40:34.336 --> 01:40:37.406
I had to fake my death
to gain Rayna's trust.

01:40:37.439 --> 01:40:39.674
I jammed the signal,
popped out my lens.

01:40:39.708 --> 01:40:41.543
It was easy.

01:40:41.576 --> 01:40:44.346
I hated to do it to you, Coop,
but I had to. I had to.

01:40:44.379 --> 01:40:46.248
Rayna knew
all about our agents...

01:40:46.281 --> 01:40:48.983
because Karen Walker
sold her the names.

01:40:49.017 --> 01:40:50.285
I just couldn't trust anyone
at the agency

01:40:50.319 --> 01:40:52.421
not to give me away,
not even you.

01:40:52.454 --> 01:40:54.089
How do I even know
you're telling me the truth?

01:40:54.123 --> 01:40:56.091
Did Karen Walker
try to kill you?

01:40:56.125 --> 01:40:57.559
You shot her?

01:40:57.592 --> 01:40:59.661
I'm deep undercover.

01:40:59.694 --> 01:41:01.630
But not so deep that
I can't still protect you.

01:41:03.031 --> 01:41:04.099
All right, look me
in the eye.

01:41:04.133 --> 01:41:05.334
What?

01:41:05.367 --> 01:41:06.801
Really look me
in the eye.

01:41:09.638 --> 01:41:11.706
One of your eyes is bigger
than the other.

01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:12.807
Really?

01:41:13.041 --> 01:41:15.076
No.

01:41:15.110 --> 01:41:16.978
You're perfect,
God damn it.

01:41:17.011 --> 01:41:18.447
Asshole.

01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:19.714
(GROANS) SUSAN: God! (GROANS)

01:41:21.116 --> 01:41:22.384
That hurt.

01:41:22.417 --> 01:41:24.619
Good, it was
supposed to.

01:41:24.653 --> 01:41:25.920
Bosom.

01:41:25.954 --> 01:41:27.622
Is he dangerous?

01:41:27.656 --> 01:41:30.024
Only if you have boobs.

01:41:30.058 --> 01:41:32.294
So did Rayna
really know I was a spy?

01:41:32.327 --> 01:41:35.730
No. Not until you blew your
cover back at that kitchen.

01:41:35.764 --> 01:41:38.099
I really thought she was more
experienced than that.

01:41:38.133 --> 01:41:39.734
Thank God she's not, huh?

01:41:39.768 --> 01:41:42.504
Because if she was,
you'd be dead now.

01:41:42.537 --> 01:41:43.977
I think they're pretty
good covers...

01:41:44.005 --> 01:41:45.640
I gotta go.

01:41:45.674 --> 01:41:47.776
We're heading to De Luca's
villa to meet with Dudaev.

01:41:47.809 --> 01:41:50.345
Then we're taking him
to wherever the bomb is.

01:41:50.379 --> 01:41:51.446
This thing is almost over.

01:41:53.482 --> 01:41:54.616
Hang tight.

01:41:59.321 --> 01:42:01.323
Hello, bound lady.

01:42:01.790 --> 01:42:03.192
Not now, Aldo.

01:42:03.225 --> 01:42:06.928
I think Mr. Fine
has underestimated you.

01:42:06.961 --> 01:42:09.030
You found your targets,

01:42:09.063 --> 01:42:10.783
you tracked them down,
you fought very hard.

01:42:11.132 --> 01:42:12.367
Susan...

01:42:14.102 --> 01:42:15.237
you are a good agent.

01:42:18.006 --> 01:42:19.874
You'll get them
next time, huh?

01:42:21.643 --> 01:42:23.345
Unless we die here.

01:42:26.215 --> 01:42:28.450
Then you will not.

01:42:28.483 --> 01:42:30.419
You know what,
I'm not going down like this.

01:42:30.452 --> 01:42:31.986
I need you to untie me.

01:42:32.020 --> 01:42:33.222
Bosom. What?

01:42:33.255 --> 01:42:34.856
Stop! God damn it!

01:42:35.824 --> 01:42:36.824
Just untie me.

01:42:37.659 --> 01:42:39.728
No, you heard Mr. Fine.
He's working a plan.

01:42:39.761 --> 01:42:40.862
We have to stay put.

01:42:40.895 --> 01:42:42.697
Untie me. Now.

01:42:46.201 --> 01:42:47.736
That's my ass.

01:42:47.769 --> 01:42:50.939
It is very difficult to see
or gauge my position.

01:42:50.972 --> 01:42:52.341
You're just simply
grabbing my ass.

01:42:52.374 --> 01:42:54.909
Oh. I am, sorry.

01:42:54.943 --> 01:42:56.978
Let's roll
to our side.

01:42:57.011 --> 01:42:58.079
God!

01:42:58.112 --> 01:42:59.848
Oh! Hey!

01:42:59.881 --> 01:43:02.951
The knot is very tight,
but I am making progress.

01:43:02.984 --> 01:43:04.553
Your hand is way up in there.

01:43:04.586 --> 01:43:08.290
My right hand is restrained
from the weight of my body.

01:43:08.323 --> 01:43:09.691
Okay. Let's try this.

01:43:09.724 --> 01:43:10.892
Oh, God.

01:43:10.925 --> 01:43:12.394
(GRUNTING)

01:43:12.427 --> 01:43:16.798
Okay. I will
inchworm my way...

01:43:17.299 --> 01:43:18.767
(GRUNTING LOUDLY)

01:43:23.872 --> 01:43:25.274
You're being very loud.

01:43:27.242 --> 01:43:28.543
(GROANING)

01:43:29.611 --> 01:43:30.611
Shh!

01:43:31.179 --> 01:43:32.514
(GROANING)

01:43:34.015 --> 01:43:36.751
Wait. I have idea.

01:43:36.785 --> 01:43:37.785
God. Another one?

01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:40.322
Oh, Jesus.
Don't move.

01:43:40.355 --> 01:43:41.823
Wait, wait, wait!
Stay still.

01:43:41.856 --> 01:43:43.091
No, no, no!

01:43:43.124 --> 01:43:44.459
Yes, yes, yes.

01:43:44.493 --> 01:43:45.994
Oh, God!
Yes.

01:43:46.027 --> 01:43:47.729
Can't be happening.

01:43:47.762 --> 01:43:49.898
Damn it, I was having
such an empowering moment

01:43:49.931 --> 01:43:52.000
before this started.

01:43:52.033 --> 01:43:57.272
My penis may be gently kissing
the back of your head.

01:43:57.306 --> 01:43:58.840
Just untie me
before I crush your nuts.

01:43:58.873 --> 01:44:00.342
Oh, please.

01:44:00.375 --> 01:44:02.877
If only we had time
for such pleasures.

01:44:03.678 --> 01:44:05.547
Go!

01:44:05.580 --> 01:44:07.949
Your face and the knot
are about to enter my colon.

01:44:09.884 --> 01:44:11.320
Stop licking it!

01:44:13.355 --> 01:44:14.589
(BOTH GRUNTING)

01:44:15.424 --> 01:44:16.858
It is done.

01:44:16.891 --> 01:44:18.427
Thank you, Aldo.

01:44:18.460 --> 01:44:20.194
I don't wanna know
why my neck is wet...

01:44:20.228 --> 01:44:22.096
but you did excellent work.
Prego.

01:44:22.130 --> 01:44:24.065
Turn around,
let me untie you,

01:44:24.098 --> 01:44:25.600
and let's get
the fuck out of here.

01:44:50.158 --> 01:44:51.158
(SIZZLING)

01:45:11.312 --> 01:45:13.214
I need you to alert
CIA and Interpol.

01:45:13.247 --> 01:45:15.116
I'm gonna go to De Luca's
and back up Fine.

01:45:15.149 --> 01:45:16.229
You know where
the villa is?

01:45:18.553 --> 01:45:20.855
I know everything.

01:45:20.889 --> 01:45:23.324
One day, lady super spy...

01:45:23.358 --> 01:45:24.859

01:45:25.460 --> 01:45:26.761
I will fuck you.

01:46:41.436 --> 01:46:43.004
(MEN YELLING)

01:47:04.959 --> 01:47:07.161
Welcome to Lake Balaton.

01:47:07.195 --> 01:47:08.597
I found this staircase

01:47:08.630 --> 01:47:11.633
and made them build
a house around it.

01:47:11.666 --> 01:47:14.168
Our dear Mr. Dudaev
will be arriving shortly.

01:47:15.704 --> 01:47:19.674
You are about to become
a very rich woman, Rayna.

01:47:19.708 --> 01:47:21.676
Which means you'll have to be
a little more careful...

01:47:21.710 --> 01:47:24.112
about the company you keep.

01:47:24.145 --> 01:47:27.516
So many people have such
terrible agendas...

01:47:27.549 --> 01:47:29.984
like perhaps
your friend here.

01:47:30.018 --> 01:47:32.787
I can see his obvious
outer appeal.

01:47:33.655 --> 01:47:35.056
You have terrific eyes.

01:47:35.790 --> 01:47:37.191
Thanks.

01:47:37.225 --> 01:47:39.127
But he also works
for the CIA, doesn't he?

01:47:40.461 --> 01:47:44.298
An odd choice of companion for
someone in your work, Rayna.

01:47:44.332 --> 01:47:47.368
Doesn't exactly inspire
confidence in those around you.

01:47:47.401 --> 01:47:50.505
Fuck you, Sergio. You would never
talk to my father like that.

01:47:50.539 --> 01:47:51.673
I never had to.

01:47:51.706 --> 01:47:53.542
Mr. De Luca, it's true.

01:47:53.575 --> 01:47:56.010
I worked for the CIA,
but they think I'm dead.

01:47:56.044 --> 01:47:58.780
I'm with Rayna now, and I'm
here to help you both.

01:47:59.681 --> 01:48:02.751
You and Karen Walker
are both double agents.

01:48:03.885 --> 01:48:05.920
What's going on
at the CIA?

01:48:05.954 --> 01:48:07.689
Drones taking all
the cool assignments?

01:48:08.089 --> 01:48:09.089
(BOTH LAUGH)

01:48:10.058 --> 01:48:11.498
If we don't get rid
of him right now,

01:48:11.526 --> 01:48:12.761
I'm calling off the deal.

01:48:14.763 --> 01:48:17.131
Don't you fucking dare.

01:48:17.165 --> 01:48:18.633
Yeah, why don't you listen
to that asshole.

01:48:18.667 --> 01:48:20.802
Don't you fucking dare.

01:48:20.835 --> 01:48:23.572
You're a bit
outnumbered here, Miss...

01:48:24.739 --> 01:48:26.040
I'm sorry, what the
fuck is your name?

01:48:26.074 --> 01:48:28.810
Susan Cooper.
I'm with the CIA.

01:48:28.843 --> 01:48:31.613
Jesus. Rayna, did you invite
the entire agency here...

01:48:31.646 --> 01:48:34.348
or are they just having
a company retreat

01:48:34.382 --> 01:48:35.684
at the villa next door?

01:48:35.717 --> 01:48:37.151
God, you're funny, huh?

01:48:37.185 --> 01:48:38.519
It's just me.

01:48:38.553 --> 01:48:39.621
It's gonna be
in your best interest

01:48:39.654 --> 01:48:41.790
to keep Fine and me alive.

01:48:41.823 --> 01:48:44.559
I'm trying, but I'm not quite
following your logic.

01:48:44.593 --> 01:48:46.394
You want me to slow it down
for you? Okay.

01:48:46.427 --> 01:48:48.062
You're about to meet
with Solsa Dudaev...

01:48:48.096 --> 01:48:51.099
a man I've been collecting
intelligence on for years.

01:48:51.132 --> 01:48:52.634
And I'm guessing
that your boys here

01:48:52.667 --> 01:48:53.968
are too busy manscaping...

01:48:54.002 --> 01:48:56.437
to have told you
how he does business.

01:48:56.470 --> 01:48:58.673
Because about half the people
he deals with end up dead.

01:48:58.707 --> 01:48:59.941
I can tell you what
Dudaev's gonna do

01:48:59.974 --> 01:49:02.043
five minutes before he
even thinks about it.

01:49:02.076 --> 01:49:05.313
And I sure as shit know enough to
cover up a Russian flag tattoo...

01:49:05.346 --> 01:49:07.115
since Dudaev's brother was
killed by the Russian military.

01:49:07.148 --> 01:49:08.617
Jesus!

01:49:08.650 --> 01:49:10.885
You own a computer?
You heard of fucking Google?

01:49:10.919 --> 01:49:12.320
I'll tell you another thing.

01:49:12.353 --> 01:49:13.521
You know
your little girlfriend...

01:49:13.554 --> 01:49:15.790
the one from
the Paris bombing?

01:49:15.824 --> 01:49:17.491
She's just using you
to get to Rayna.

01:49:17.525 --> 01:49:19.127
If it hadn't been for me
last night...

01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:20.662
she would've kidnapped her
at the club...

01:49:20.695 --> 01:49:21.630
and then you'd be
standing here

01:49:21.663 --> 01:49:22.831
with your dick
in your hand...

01:49:22.864 --> 01:49:24.232
because you'd never
find that bomb.

01:49:24.265 --> 01:49:26.367
So you need me, De Luca.

01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:28.603
And I'm not gonna help you
unless you keep Fine alive.

01:49:35.043 --> 01:49:36.410
Now, let me
get this straight.

01:49:36.444 --> 01:49:37.979
You work for the CIA...

01:49:38.012 --> 01:49:40.649
yet you're willing to help me
sell a nuclear bomb...

01:49:40.682 --> 01:49:42.183
in order to save
this man's life?

01:49:42.216 --> 01:49:43.484
Why would I believe that?

01:49:43.517 --> 01:49:45.620
Because she's in love
with him.

01:49:47.021 --> 01:49:48.322
Yeah, so what?

01:49:48.356 --> 01:49:50.024
This idiot
doesn't even know it.

01:49:50.058 --> 01:49:52.326
Too dumb to know
I'd do anything for him.

01:49:54.128 --> 01:49:55.930
And fuck the CIA, right?

01:49:55.964 --> 01:49:57.766
What have they ever
done for me?

01:49:57.799 --> 01:50:00.034
Took 10 years of my life,
gave me shitty pay...

01:50:00.068 --> 01:50:02.837
put me in a basement with
a ceiling full of bats...

01:50:02.871 --> 01:50:04.873
that pretty sure gave me pinkeye
or at least an allergy...

01:50:04.906 --> 01:50:06.240
Something got fucked up
in my eye.

01:50:08.042 --> 01:50:09.477
I would've been out
a long time ago

01:50:09.510 --> 01:50:10.712
if it hadn't been for Fine.

01:50:12.981 --> 01:50:16.050
So, yeah, I'll do anything
it takes to keep him alive.

01:50:17.686 --> 01:50:19.620
That's pretty pathetic,
right?

01:50:19.654 --> 01:50:22.023
(SCOFFS) Extremely pathetic.

01:50:22.590 --> 01:50:24.358
God, you're an asshole.

01:50:24.392 --> 01:50:27.028
When this is over, I'm gonna
shave that fucking head.

01:50:27.762 --> 01:50:28.797
All right, Miss Havisham.

01:50:29.864 --> 01:50:31.365
I'll take you up
on your offer.

01:50:31.399 --> 01:50:33.935
But if you try anything,
I mean anything...

01:50:35.203 --> 01:50:36.705
I'll make
your dream come true

01:50:36.738 --> 01:50:38.378
and send you and
your boyfriend to heaven.

01:50:40.341 --> 01:50:41.341
Let's go.

01:50:54.588 --> 01:50:55.790
Mr. Dudaev.

01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:57.992
Welcome to Hungary.

01:50:58.026 --> 01:51:00.695
Like Chechnya,
only easier to pronounce.

01:51:01.562 --> 01:51:03.364
Enough with the bullshit.

01:51:04.432 --> 01:51:06.467
Where is the package?

01:51:06.500 --> 01:51:09.704
Once my client
sees the payment...

01:51:09.738 --> 01:51:12.473
she'll take us all to its
very secure hiding spot.

01:51:12.506 --> 01:51:14.675
Wherever that may be.

01:51:23.151 --> 01:51:24.185
I got it, handsome.

01:51:26.154 --> 01:51:27.655
100,000,000 Euros

01:51:27.688 --> 01:51:29.128
doesn't buy
what it used to, does it?

01:51:32.861 --> 01:51:34.062
Nice ice, Solsa.

01:51:36.130 --> 01:51:37.165
Right.

01:51:38.532 --> 01:51:39.834
He's all yours.

01:51:39.868 --> 01:51:42.103
Gentlemen,
if you would follow me.

01:52:09.164 --> 01:52:10.399
Here it is.

01:52:10.432 --> 01:52:11.733
What is this bullshit?

01:52:11.767 --> 01:52:13.668
Bullshit?

01:52:13.702 --> 01:52:15.470
Solsa, I'll have you know...

01:52:15.504 --> 01:52:16.738
It's the nuke.

01:52:18.340 --> 01:52:19.741
Clever girl.

01:52:26.415 --> 01:52:27.415
A lead-lined compartment.

01:52:28.283 --> 01:52:29.551
RAYNA: Correct.

01:52:29.584 --> 01:52:32.354
The lead lining is thick as to
mask any radiation detection.

01:52:32.387 --> 01:52:34.723
My father was extremely
good at his job.

01:52:34.756 --> 01:52:36.558
DE LUCA: Unbelievable!

01:52:36.591 --> 01:52:37.831
You could have warned me,
Rayna.

01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:39.028
I've been throwing
my gym clothes

01:52:39.061 --> 01:52:40.301
on top of that thing
for a week.

01:52:56.812 --> 01:52:58.247
It is beautiful.

01:52:59.481 --> 01:53:00.515
Yes, it is.

01:53:05.855 --> 01:53:06.935
What the fuck
are you doing?

01:53:07.789 --> 01:53:08.858
Conducting business.

01:53:14.997 --> 01:53:15.997
Uh-uh.

01:53:17.799 --> 01:53:18.799
Put it in the helicopter.

01:53:19.835 --> 01:53:20.955
And don't forget
my diamonds.

01:53:24.606 --> 01:53:26.108
What the fuck is going on?

01:53:26.141 --> 01:53:27.843
De Luca played you, Rayna.

01:53:27.877 --> 01:53:29.378
And you led him right to it.

01:53:29.411 --> 01:53:31.813
You didn't expect me
to let him have it, did you?

01:53:31.847 --> 01:53:34.316
I mean, it's like giving a
Stradivarius to a hillbilly.

01:53:34.349 --> 01:53:36.018
I have a buyer
who's willing to pay me

01:53:36.051 --> 01:53:38.620
500,000,000 Euros for it.

01:53:38.653 --> 01:53:40.055
And Dudaev would've
never been able

01:53:40.089 --> 01:53:42.557
to get that bomb
onto American soil.

01:53:42.591 --> 01:53:44.526
My buyer will have it in the
middle of New York City...

01:53:44.559 --> 01:53:46.295
and use it next week.

01:53:47.496 --> 01:53:48.998
So, you know,

01:53:49.031 --> 01:53:50.265
if you haven't seen
Phantom yet...

01:53:50.299 --> 01:53:52.434
So, what?

01:53:52.467 --> 01:53:54.347
Does this mean you're gonna
kill me too, Sergio?

01:53:54.736 --> 01:53:56.005
I'm afraid so.

01:53:56.906 --> 01:53:58.340
Sorry, Rayna.

01:53:58.373 --> 01:53:59.708
It's just cleaner that way.
You understand.

01:53:59.741 --> 01:54:00.910
Explain it to me, De Luca!

01:54:03.412 --> 01:54:04.412
(GRUNTS)

01:54:08.750 --> 01:54:10.886
(SIGHS)
God. He means well.

01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:12.720
This day just keeps getting
better and better.

01:54:14.256 --> 01:54:15.925
Thanks for the
performance, folks.

01:54:15.958 --> 01:54:17.459
But sorry, Rayna,
show's over.

01:54:24.399 --> 01:54:25.399
Go! Go!

01:54:34.676 --> 01:54:35.676
(GRUNTS)

01:54:44.253 --> 01:54:45.787
Holy shit.

01:54:45.820 --> 01:54:47.189
Where's De Luca?
Susan!

01:54:48.823 --> 01:54:49.824
Get down!

01:54:49.858 --> 01:54:51.160
(GROANS)

01:54:51.193 --> 01:54:52.261
No!

01:54:52.294 --> 01:54:53.662
Whoa! Ah!

01:54:56.398 --> 01:54:57.499
(BOTH GRUNTING)

01:54:59.368 --> 01:55:01.136
I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

01:55:01.170 --> 01:55:02.671
Rayna!
What?

01:55:02.704 --> 01:55:03.704
Under the car!

01:55:04.839 --> 01:55:05.839
Push it over!

01:55:07.609 --> 01:55:09.178
Seriously?

01:55:09.211 --> 01:55:11.546
God, use those fucking
bird arms and push it!

01:55:17.219 --> 01:55:18.219
(CLICKS)

01:55:19.288 --> 01:55:20.288
(LAUGHING)

01:55:20.622 --> 01:55:21.622
Oh!

01:55:22.557 --> 01:55:23.557
What happened?

01:55:24.393 --> 01:55:25.560
Did I get him?

01:55:25.594 --> 01:55:27.562
De Luca's got the bomb
on the helicopter. Get up!

01:55:27.596 --> 01:55:28.930
Oh, fuck me!

01:55:28.964 --> 01:55:30.165
I got this.

01:55:37.539 --> 01:55:38.807
No!

01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:40.542
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!

01:55:40.575 --> 01:55:41.543
Hurry up!

01:55:41.576 --> 01:55:42.576
Come on!

01:55:47.449 --> 01:55:48.550
Kill her!

01:55:49.951 --> 01:55:51.220
I've got this.
I've done this before!

01:55:51.253 --> 01:55:52.253
Ah!

01:55:55.457 --> 01:55:57.092
(GUN CLICKS)

01:55:57.126 --> 01:55:58.446
Cooper, you're gonna
fuck this up!

01:55:58.760 --> 01:55:59.760
Shut up and help!

01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:07.069
Are you kidding me?

01:56:11.873 --> 01:56:13.108
Ford, what the hell
are you doing?

01:56:13.142 --> 01:56:14.509
I'm gonna crawl up you...

01:56:14.543 --> 01:56:15.610
and take out De Luca.

01:56:16.911 --> 01:56:18.180
Get your hands off my boobs!

01:56:18.213 --> 01:56:19.548
I'm saving you!

01:56:19.581 --> 01:56:21.716
Oh, my God.
Those do not belong on those!

01:56:21.750 --> 01:56:22.884
I can't get a good grip.

01:56:22.917 --> 01:56:24.953
Your pants are too slippery!

01:56:24.986 --> 01:56:26.788
You should have worn
coarser pants.

01:56:26.821 --> 01:56:29.291
Well, I'm tired of wearing
my fucking sandpaper pants.

01:56:29.324 --> 01:56:31.460
Clench your ass!
Clench your fucking ass!

01:56:32.661 --> 01:56:33.895
Oh! Get out of there!

01:56:33.928 --> 01:56:35.464
Help me out!

01:56:35.497 --> 01:56:36.898
You motherfucker!

01:56:36.931 --> 01:56:38.300
I'm gonna report you to HR.

01:56:38.667 --> 01:56:39.834
(YELLS)

01:56:39.868 --> 01:56:41.170
Hang on tight!

01:56:41.203 --> 01:56:43.004
I'm gonna swing like
I'm on a trapeze,

01:56:43.038 --> 01:56:44.606
and leap my way up
to the cockpit...

01:56:45.940 --> 01:56:46.940
(SCREAMING)

01:56:48.477 --> 01:56:51.513
I told you you was gonna
fuck this up, Cooper!

01:56:56.051 --> 01:56:57.552
SUSAN: Holy smokes!

01:56:58.153 --> 01:56:59.588
Ooh, that's high!

01:57:00.155 --> 01:57:01.190
(SCREAMS)

01:57:06.461 --> 01:57:07.629
God damn it!

01:57:09.131 --> 01:57:11.166
Fucking new suit.

01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:13.034
This shit ends now!

01:57:15.404 --> 01:57:16.538
Freeze!

01:57:16.571 --> 01:57:17.772
Oh, my God!

01:57:17.806 --> 01:57:19.608
I am not in the fucking mood
for your bullshit!

01:57:19.641 --> 01:57:20.761
Yeah? Then you'll love this!

01:57:21.776 --> 01:57:23.078
(SCREAMS)

01:57:23.112 --> 01:57:26.548
I am not in the mood
for your bullshit!

01:57:26.581 --> 01:57:27.582
Back up!

01:57:28.117 --> 01:57:29.551
Sorry, spy.

01:57:29.584 --> 01:57:30.585
Playtime's over.

01:57:30.619 --> 01:57:31.753
Yeah, it is.

01:57:31.786 --> 01:57:32.754
Say goodbye to your toys!

01:57:32.787 --> 01:57:33.955
What are you doing?

01:57:33.988 --> 01:57:35.028
Don't you dare!
Oh, my God!

01:57:35.056 --> 01:57:36.125
Don't!

01:57:37.992 --> 01:57:39.428
No!

01:57:39.461 --> 01:57:40.529
Oh, my God!

01:57:49.504 --> 01:57:50.504
(GROANS)

01:57:54.809 --> 01:57:56.178
Die!

01:57:56.211 --> 01:57:57.246
(GUNSHOT)
Ah!

01:58:01.049 --> 01:58:02.251
(WHOOPING)

01:58:02.284 --> 01:58:04.353
I just shot a man!

01:58:04.386 --> 01:58:06.821
Is it wrong
it felt so right?

01:58:06.855 --> 01:58:08.290
It's so me!

01:58:10.759 --> 01:58:12.394
Hey! Heroic lady!

01:58:13.128 --> 01:58:14.396
In my country,

01:58:14.429 --> 01:58:17.098
there is a saying
about women like you...

01:58:17.132 --> 01:58:18.900
"Hot as fuck!"

01:58:18.933 --> 01:58:21.203
Oh, God. Not now, Aldo.

01:58:21.236 --> 01:58:22.504
Go, Susan!

01:58:22.771 --> 01:58:24.105
Oh.

01:58:24.139 --> 01:58:25.540
That was not part
of my plan.

01:58:27.041 --> 01:58:28.810
(GRUNTS)

01:58:28.843 --> 01:58:31.846
Just like a woman
to wear jewelry into battle.

01:58:31.880 --> 01:58:33.248
Although,
this is the ugliest

01:58:33.282 --> 01:58:34.483
fucking necklace
I've ever seen!

01:58:34.516 --> 01:58:35.650
Yes, it is.

01:58:35.684 --> 01:58:36.684
And it's all yours...

01:58:37.252 --> 01:58:38.587
with an adjustable toggle!

01:58:39.020 --> 01:58:41.190
(SCREAMING)

01:58:50.765 --> 01:58:51.966
(ALARMS BEEPING)

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:53.668
Here we go. No problem.

01:58:54.102 --> 01:58:56.137
Come on!

01:58:56.171 --> 01:58:58.072
Okay!
All right, I got it.

01:58:58.106 --> 01:58:59.341
I got it.

01:59:06.415 --> 01:59:08.049
Nice copter!
Where'd you get it?

01:59:08.082 --> 01:59:10.419
It's 50 Cent's!

01:59:10.452 --> 01:59:12.954
I had to deputize him
to let us use it!

01:59:12.987 --> 01:59:15.156
He is so afraid of me!

01:59:15.190 --> 01:59:17.192
I'm a motherfucking spy!

01:59:17.226 --> 01:59:18.760
Let's go shoot
somebody else!

01:59:18.793 --> 01:59:22.231
Simmer down, 50 Cent,
or I'll mount you again.

01:59:22.264 --> 01:59:24.065
This day is just getting
better and better!

01:59:24.098 --> 01:59:25.600
He wants me!

01:59:26.968 --> 01:59:29.103
I think we should land.

01:59:29.137 --> 01:59:31.206
I dropped a nuke
in the water.

01:59:32.207 --> 01:59:33.308
(EXHALES)

01:59:45.019 --> 01:59:47.222
Good job, guys.
Sorry about the lake.

01:59:47.256 --> 01:59:48.357
All right, motherfucker,
don't push.

01:59:48.390 --> 01:59:49.958
You're gonna
get your pictures.

01:59:49.991 --> 01:59:51.326
There's enough 50
to go around.

01:59:51.360 --> 01:59:52.527
You know I just helped
kill a terrorist, right?

01:59:52.561 --> 01:59:53.962
You ever see Kanye
do some shit like that?

01:59:53.995 --> 01:59:55.364
He never, never!

01:59:59.468 --> 02:00:01.403
Isn't this wonderful?

02:00:01.436 --> 02:00:03.872
I was hoping to spend
the rest of my life in jail.

02:00:03.905 --> 02:00:05.740
Give me some quality time
to deal with the fact...

02:00:05.774 --> 02:00:07.894
that I was sleeping with
the man who killed my father.

02:00:08.310 --> 02:00:09.644
Anyway. Call my lawyer.

02:00:09.678 --> 02:00:10.979
Get the Goyard tote
from the hotel.

02:00:11.012 --> 02:00:12.247
I need everything on time...

02:00:12.281 --> 02:00:14.048
Do you think
I still work for you?

02:00:14.082 --> 02:00:16.818
Whatever. Fuck you.

02:00:16.851 --> 02:00:19.421
I knew you really liked me.

02:00:20.589 --> 02:00:21.589
Hey!

02:00:23.758 --> 02:00:25.594
Fuck you too.

02:00:30.532 --> 02:00:32.000
Don't touch
my fucking hair!

02:00:34.336 --> 02:00:35.570
What are you looking at?

02:00:40.208 --> 02:00:41.676
Oh, God, Aldo, don't...

02:00:41.710 --> 02:00:44.713
I am too tired
to fend off your groping.

02:00:44.746 --> 02:00:45.947
(WITH BRITISH ACCENT)
Please.

02:00:45.980 --> 02:00:48.249
I understand completely.

02:00:48.283 --> 02:00:51.085
Look, my real name
is Albert...

02:00:51.119 --> 02:00:52.421
MI6.

02:00:52.454 --> 02:00:55.290
Look, I'm sorry if
my disguise was a bit much.

02:00:55.324 --> 02:00:57.225
I just like to really
get into character.

02:00:57.258 --> 02:00:59.160
Although I fear
I may have become

02:00:59.193 --> 02:01:01.029
overexcited
at certain points.

02:01:01.062 --> 02:01:02.263
Little bit.

02:01:02.297 --> 02:01:03.732
By way of apology...

02:01:03.765 --> 02:01:06.635
should your work ever
bring you to London...

02:01:06.668 --> 02:01:09.237
I would love
to take you for dinner.

02:01:09.270 --> 02:01:11.906
Okay. Yeah,
I think that would be nice.

02:01:11.940 --> 02:01:13.342
Wonderful.

02:01:17.679 --> 02:01:19.080
God!

02:01:19.113 --> 02:01:21.983
(WITH ITALIAN ACCENT) How you
like my English accent, huh?

02:01:22.016 --> 02:01:25.354
I learn it from
the Downton Abbey.

02:01:25.387 --> 02:01:27.027
(WITH BRITISH ACCENT)
No, I'm only joking.

02:01:27.288 --> 02:01:28.623
Or am I?

02:01:28.657 --> 02:01:29.758
Oh, my God.

02:01:30.825 --> 02:01:31.825
FINE: Coop.

02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:33.127
Great work.

02:01:33.161 --> 02:01:34.829
What a job.

02:01:34.863 --> 02:01:36.565
Super Cooper.
Really amazing.

02:01:36.598 --> 02:01:38.199
Thanks.
ELAINE: Yes, it was.

02:01:38.232 --> 02:01:39.300
You really came through.

02:01:39.334 --> 02:01:40.635
Thank you, ma'am.

02:01:40.669 --> 02:01:42.036
I'd like to keep you
out in the field for now.

02:01:42.236 --> 02:01:43.738
Wow.

02:01:43.772 --> 02:01:45.807
We need you to fly
to Prague tomorrow...

02:01:45.840 --> 02:01:48.076
to infiltrate an international
drug-smuggling ring.

02:01:48.109 --> 02:01:49.378
Here's your new identity.

02:01:51.980 --> 02:01:52.980
You in, Cooper?

02:01:54.148 --> 02:01:56.818
Agent Susan Cooper
reporting for duty, ma'am.

02:01:56.851 --> 02:01:59.020
Nobody says or does that, but great.
I won't do that.

02:01:59.053 --> 02:02:00.053
Okay.

02:02:00.389 --> 02:02:01.790
Thank you.

02:02:01.823 --> 02:02:04.125
Francis Mays is an
unemployed telemarketer

02:02:04.158 --> 02:02:05.360
living off her
disability checks.

02:02:05.394 --> 02:02:07.562
Oh, sweet Jesus!

02:02:07.596 --> 02:02:10.164
And who wears reading glasses
in their passport photo?

02:02:10.198 --> 02:02:12.300
She's only kidding.
She got ya!

02:02:12.333 --> 02:02:14.202
(ALL LAUGHING)

02:02:14.235 --> 02:02:15.704
Oh, my God!
That was a good one!

02:02:18.239 --> 02:02:20.108
Yeah, actually, I'm not. I
don't have a sense of humor.

02:02:20.141 --> 02:02:21.175
No, you don't.

02:02:21.209 --> 02:02:22.844
We'll talk soon.

02:02:22.877 --> 02:02:25.380
Glad the pinkeye
is under control.

02:02:25.414 --> 02:02:26.815
That was actually
an allergy...

02:02:26.848 --> 02:02:27.949
Okay. Got it.

02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:29.918
So, you're a spy now, Coop.

02:02:29.951 --> 02:02:30.951
Yeah.

02:02:31.453 --> 02:02:32.320
Congratulations.

02:02:32.353 --> 02:02:34.222
Thanks.

02:02:34.255 --> 02:02:35.223
I don't think
I'll ever find anyone

02:02:35.256 --> 02:02:36.456
as good as you
in the basement.

02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:39.894
I think you will.

02:02:39.928 --> 02:02:41.563
There's a lot of good people
down there.

02:02:43.732 --> 02:02:44.966
So, hey...

02:02:44.999 --> 02:02:48.537
I know a great little
restaurant right near here.

02:02:48.570 --> 02:02:52.941
Maybe you and I could go
for a nice, long dinner?

02:02:59.814 --> 02:03:00.982
You know what,

02:03:01.015 --> 02:03:03.452
I'm just kind of feeling
like a girls' night.

02:03:04.318 --> 02:03:05.954
You understand, right?

02:03:05.987 --> 02:03:07.922
Yeah, sure.

02:03:07.956 --> 02:03:09.858
I'll catch you later.
You go have a great time.

02:03:09.891 --> 02:03:10.891
Thank you.

02:03:12.561 --> 02:03:14.429
You're a lot furrier
than I thought you'd be.

02:03:15.063 --> 02:03:16.665
Yeah.
Yeah.

02:03:16.698 --> 02:03:17.999
Smell you later, pal.
(CHUCKLES)

02:03:20.802 --> 02:03:22.971
Hey, Coop.

02:03:23.004 --> 02:03:25.974
All those things you said
about me to De Luca...

02:03:27.842 --> 02:03:28.842
Did you mean that?

02:03:30.011 --> 02:03:31.012
God, I admire you.

02:03:34.516 --> 02:03:35.950
Glad you're still
alive, Beverly,

02:03:35.984 --> 02:03:37.385
you silly fucking
girly wanker!

02:03:37.418 --> 02:03:38.520
God!

02:03:39.087 --> 02:03:40.154
Nice work, Cooper.

02:03:41.289 --> 02:03:43.458
Wow. Is that a compliment?

02:03:43.492 --> 02:03:44.993
That's not easy
for you to do.

02:03:45.026 --> 02:03:46.795
Fuck it. Look, you
did a good job.

02:03:46.828 --> 02:03:48.663
Probably just beginner's
luck, though.

02:03:48.697 --> 02:03:51.032
There we go.
Where did you get a suit?

02:03:51.065 --> 02:03:52.767
I fucking made it,
didn't I?

02:03:52.801 --> 02:03:54.135
It's nice.

02:03:54.168 --> 02:03:55.904
You still out
of the CIA?

02:03:55.937 --> 02:03:58.006
Probably not.
They need me.

02:03:58.039 --> 02:04:00.041
I think I need to spend some
time on my own first, though.

02:04:00.074 --> 02:04:01.075
Clear my head.

02:04:02.376 --> 02:04:04.679
I'm gonna take this
down the coast.

02:04:04.713 --> 02:04:07.015
Maybe spend some time in Italy.
Drive it to Greece.

02:04:08.583 --> 02:04:10.952
Sometimes a man
needs to go to sea.

02:04:11.553 --> 02:04:12.821
SUSAN: Sounds good, Ford.

02:04:12.854 --> 02:04:13.888
Good for you.

02:04:14.823 --> 02:04:15.823
Take care.

02:04:16.357 --> 02:04:17.357
NANCY: Bye.

02:04:20.061 --> 02:04:21.696
FORD: Arrivederci.

02:04:24.332 --> 02:04:25.500
Do you think
he knows that's a lake?

02:04:25.534 --> 02:04:27.636
No, I don't.

02:04:32.707 --> 02:04:34.643
Let's go.
Okay.

02:04:34.676 --> 02:04:36.845
You can't let anybody see
how sore I am.

02:04:36.878 --> 02:04:37.979
I got you.
Okay.

02:04:38.012 --> 02:04:39.280
Come here.

02:04:39.313 --> 02:04:41.415
My glutes
are really seizing up.

02:04:41.449 --> 02:04:43.117
If you're sore,
I'll tell you what.

02:04:43.151 --> 02:04:45.053
Take a hot bath and then
we're gonna celebrate.

02:04:45.086 --> 02:04:47.221
I hope you like champagne
and beef jerky.

02:04:47.255 --> 02:04:48.489
Well... Oh. That's a...

02:04:48.523 --> 02:04:49.691
You have to!

02:04:49.724 --> 02:04:51.425
Because I stole
a case of it...

02:04:51.459 --> 02:04:52.661
I don't know
if I like them together.

02:04:52.694 --> 02:04:54.797
...out of 50 Cent's
helicopter!

02:04:55.430 --> 02:04:57.032
Slower, slower.

02:04:57.066 --> 02:04:59.234
FORD: Cooper,
is this a fucking lake?

02:05:00.936 --> 02:05:03.138
How the fuck
do I get to Italy?
