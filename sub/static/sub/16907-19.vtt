00:02.252 --> 00:03.799
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

00:04.086 --> 00:05.339
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

00:05.589 --> 00:09.093
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

00:09.259 --> 00:11.432
<i>Today, I fight that war on two fronts.</i>

00:11.637 --> 00:13.856
<i>By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.</i>

00:14.097 --> 00:15.849
<i>But by night, I am someone else.</i>

00:16.099 --> 00:18.101
<i>I am something else.</i>

00:18.352 --> 00:20.855
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

00:22.105 --> 00:23.027
Previously on Arrow...

00:23.273 --> 00:25.696
Zoe's in a foster home.
A good one, it looks like.

00:26.527 --> 00:27.779
She shouldn't be anywhere near me.

00:27.945 --> 00:30.289
I don't agree with that. I have
a lawyer friend who doesn't, either.

00:30.447 --> 00:31.448
I'm worried about you.

00:31.615 --> 00:32.616
Because you're into something,

00:32.824 --> 00:34.041
and you don't want to
tell anyone about it.

00:34.284 --> 00:36.332
You just have to trust me on this one.

00:36.537 --> 00:39.541
If we can produce video
that Chase is Prometheus,

00:39.790 --> 00:40.791
that's game over for him.

00:40.958 --> 00:41.959
<i>That is what we needed.</i>

00:42.125 --> 00:44.002
Please let me be the one
to walk this into SCPD.

00:44.211 --> 00:45.463
I'm gonna throw it up on YouTube.

00:45.629 --> 00:47.552
<i>There won't be anywhere
that son of a bitch can run.</i>

01:07.526 --> 01:09.073
Delta Team in position.

01:09.987 --> 01:11.409
Seems our friends are here, too.

01:11.655 --> 01:12.702
We're on site.

01:12.990 --> 01:17.086
An A.R.G.U.S. drone confirms Adrian Chase
walked into the arcade at 0900.

01:17.327 --> 01:19.830
<i>Sixteen hours ago.
That's a lifetime for Chase.</i>

01:19.997 --> 01:22.091
Yeah, but no one has entered
or exited since.

01:22.332 --> 01:23.504
We got the bastard.

01:36.722 --> 01:38.099
We have to move right now.

01:38.348 --> 01:39.270
See something?

01:39.516 --> 01:44.397
Yes. This is Maximum Force. It's vintage.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.607
We cannot let anything happen to this.

01:46.857 --> 01:48.859
I'm more worried about
something happening to me.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.569
Will you two focus?

01:55.741 --> 01:56.742
Incoming!

02:14.551 --> 02:15.894
Is everybody okay?

02:17.888 --> 02:19.390
It was vintage.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.535
Looks like we found our guy.

02:43.747 --> 02:47.126
Chase escaped the arcade by using
a secret tunnel that led to Port Newark.

02:47.751 --> 02:50.129
Homeland Security's placed him
on a no-fly list.

02:51.088 --> 02:53.432
No, he's not gonna leave the country.
He isn't done yet.

02:53.924 --> 02:55.392
How do you know?

02:58.637 --> 02:59.604
Call it a hunch.

02:59.805 --> 03:03.901
"A hunch"? Mayor Queen,
this city deserves better than a hunch.

03:06.436 --> 03:07.437
Excuse the interruption.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.281
I can't hold them off any longer.

03:16.446 --> 03:19.791
All right, I will take a few questions.
Yes?

03:19.950 --> 03:22.419
You worked side-by-side
with Adrian Chase for months.

03:22.619 --> 03:25.839
How could you not know that you had
a serial killer in your administration?

03:26.081 --> 03:30.803
Well, Mr. Chase's secret life
came as a surprise to us all.

03:31.002 --> 03:33.676
I can say that we are currently
following up some very promising leads.

03:33.922 --> 03:36.425
Are you saying
you have no idea where he is?

03:37.134 --> 03:40.604
No, I'm saying that the details of
an ongoing investigation are confidential.

03:42.139 --> 03:43.106
Yes?

03:43.306 --> 03:46.150
<i>I spent the afternoon
speaking with Gay Eked's father.</i>

03:46.351 --> 03:47.352
What do you have to say to him

03:47.602 --> 03:49.525
and the families
of all of Prometheus' victims?

03:49.813 --> 03:51.986
Well, I would say to them
what I'm saying to you.

03:52.149 --> 03:54.698
We are doing everything
that we possibly can

03:54.943 --> 03:56.445
to bring Mr. Chase to justice.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.872
Do you have anything for us
other than canned platitudes?

04:02.868 --> 04:04.336
Better question is, do we have anything?

04:04.494 --> 04:06.997
Manhunts aren't exactly
in Helix's wheelhouse, Felicity.

04:07.205 --> 04:08.502
Yeah, you helped me unmask Chase.

04:08.707 --> 04:10.550
Now I need your help
trying to find the bastard.

04:10.792 --> 04:11.793
Well, from what you've told me,

04:12.002 --> 04:14.972
they've got Homeland Security,
the FBI, and A.R.G.U.S. working on this.

04:15.172 --> 04:17.345
Yeah, and last night,
Chase played them like Maximum Force.

04:17.507 --> 04:18.507
I used to love that game.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.177
I know, I did, too.
Apparently, it's seen better days.

04:20.635 --> 04:23.354
Point being, I was expecting you and Helix
to come up with a fresh perspective.

04:23.555 --> 04:25.853
Maybe pull out some new trick,
something Chase isn't gonna anticipate.

04:26.016 --> 04:28.360
Well, it would help not having to
waste time reinventing the wheel.

04:28.852 --> 04:30.195
You wanna know what intel
they're working with?

04:30.395 --> 04:32.523
Getting into Homeland Security
and the FBI is easy.

04:32.731 --> 04:34.859
Their cyber sec is a bad joke.

04:35.192 --> 04:36.910
But breaking into A.R.G.U.S.' network...

04:37.694 --> 04:38.695
Allow me.

04:45.243 --> 04:48.372
The intel of Chase being in New Jersey
came from an A.R.G.U.S. drone.

04:48.830 --> 04:49.752
Okay. So?

04:49.998 --> 04:53.753
So, the information was then sent
to an unsecured phone.

04:54.377 --> 04:57.347
Seems like a big-time breach
in operational security.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.094
- Wait.
- "Wait," what?

04:59.341 --> 05:01.560
What if Chase has a buddy
inside A.R.G.U.S.?

05:01.760 --> 05:04.559
Someone who tipped him off,
who pinged the unsecured cell phone?

05:09.100 --> 05:10.101
Yeah.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.443
- Mr. Mayor.
- Hi.

05:55.939 --> 05:57.566
Could you give us some space?

05:59.109 --> 06:00.611
Let's go.

06:00.777 --> 06:03.405
Chase probably knew Agent Pierce
was part of our operation in Jersey.

06:03.613 --> 06:04.785
This could be payback.

06:04.948 --> 06:06.291
Okay, Lyla, what killed him?

06:06.950 --> 06:08.952
Cause of death
looks like blunt force trauma.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.796
Felicity, Curtis, we have a camera.

06:18.295 --> 06:20.423
Roger, Roger. We have clearance, Clarence.

06:20.630 --> 06:21.802
What is our vector, Victor?

06:22.007 --> 06:23.259
Guys, focus, please.

06:25.969 --> 06:27.312
That's evidence.

06:27.470 --> 06:28.687
A.R.G.U.S. evidence.

06:29.764 --> 06:32.483
All right, I got the video.
Streaming back to your phone now.

06:36.021 --> 06:38.023
<i>- Here we go.
- You guys seeing this?</i>

06:39.190 --> 06:41.943
Well, we're seeing it.
It looks like a meta.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.278
An invisible meta?

06:43.528 --> 06:45.622
Or psychokinesis.
Though, some prefer telekinesis.

06:45.822 --> 06:47.699
I don't think so.
Check out what the elevator's doing.

06:47.949 --> 06:48.871
Yeah, guys, Curtis is right.

06:49.117 --> 06:51.620
According to the elevator activity logs,
the car accelerated upwards at...

06:51.828 --> 06:53.171
Oh, my God, nine Gs.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.674
And then it just dropped into a free fall
for 40 stories.

06:55.874 --> 06:57.000
Death by elevator.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.002
This doesn't feel like Chase.

06:59.461 --> 07:01.509
No. At first, I thought Chase was
trying to tie up loose ends,

07:01.671 --> 07:03.048
but I couldn't find
any connections between them.

07:03.298 --> 07:05.175
He had his A.R.G.U.S.
security key still on him.

07:05.342 --> 07:07.015
Why enter the elevator if not to take it?

07:07.969 --> 07:09.061
Maybe to confirm the kill.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.685
Guys, how do we manipulate
an elevator like that?

07:11.848 --> 07:14.317
Remotely. I mean,
everything's computer-controlled.

07:14.517 --> 07:18.067
All right. However this happened,
let's just find whoever did it.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.532
We are on it.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.652
Huh. Looks like the elevator
was hacked in real time.

07:23.860 --> 07:24.861
Pulling up the rootkit now.

07:26.863 --> 07:29.116
Oh, my God.

07:29.324 --> 07:30.496
"Oh, my God," what?

07:31.368 --> 07:33.211
Nothing. There's a line of code here
I'm not quite getting.

07:33.370 --> 07:35.213
But I think I know someone at Helix
who can help.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.459
Hey, don't you need to show them the code?

07:39.209 --> 07:42.179
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Yes, thank you. Very helpful, Curtis.

07:49.052 --> 07:53.148
I'm sorry, Mr. Eked, but the specifics
of the investigation into Adrian Chase,

07:53.348 --> 07:55.066
they're just not open to the public.

07:56.059 --> 08:00.235
The mother of my children is dead,
and you can't tell me anything?

08:00.814 --> 08:04.068
I can assure you that the SCPD
and the Mayor's office

08:04.317 --> 08:06.570
are doing everything in their power
to apprehend him.

08:06.736 --> 08:08.033
We're gonna catch that scumbag.

08:08.238 --> 08:11.367
Oh. Instead of working
shoulder-to-shoulder with him? Huh?

08:19.416 --> 08:21.168
Sorry. It's just...

08:22.919 --> 08:25.923
Things may not have worked out
between Gay and me,

08:26.423 --> 08:28.096
but she was always there for the kids.

08:28.425 --> 08:31.429
She loved them and they loved her.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.601
And now she's gone.

08:50.196 --> 08:51.448
Please find him.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.458
<i>Gay didn't deserve dying like that.</i>

08:56.286 --> 08:58.584
And no other family deserves this pain.

09:00.707 --> 09:01.924
We will find him.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.628
And he'll know
the true meaning of justice.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.393
Thank you.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.813
How many other victims' relatives
do we have today?

09:20.810 --> 09:21.811
He was the last.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.939
God, I don't think I could handle another.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.949
These people are grieving, Rene.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.445
I'm not saying they're not
entitled to their grief, hoss.

09:29.652 --> 09:32.656
I'm saying hearing about it
all day long's a real buzzkill.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.659
You know, I'd have thought
someone in your situation

09:35.825 --> 09:38.453
would've been a little more...
Sympathetic?

09:38.661 --> 09:40.834
- My situation?
- Yeah.

09:41.164 --> 09:45.260
Curtis might've told me about your wife
and your daughter.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.009
Curtis talks too much.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.514
I don't disagree.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.018
But while he was talking,

09:55.136 --> 09:58.106
he also mentioned that he offered
to set you up with a lawyer

09:58.306 --> 09:59.649
to help get your daughter back.

10:01.184 --> 10:03.027
And that was over two months ago.

10:05.647 --> 10:07.365
I'm just not ready, hoss.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.707
A polymorphous worm
concealed by a kernel rootkit.

10:15.865 --> 10:16.991
Are you trying to talk dirty to me?

10:17.200 --> 10:19.168
I have the code, Alena. I know your work.

10:19.369 --> 10:21.121
You hacked that elevator,
you killed that A.R.G.U.S. agent...

10:21.329 --> 10:23.047
- Just slow down.
- Yes or no?

10:23.206 --> 10:24.503
- Kind of.
- "Kind of"?

10:24.707 --> 10:26.835
I didn't mean to kill him, I swear.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.175
I'd never knocked anyone out
with an elevator before,

10:29.379 --> 10:31.006
- and apparently, there's a learning curve.
- Alena.

10:31.214 --> 10:32.841
I need you to hear me out for one second.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.722
You murdered someone.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.970
Accidentally, and for a good cause.

10:37.178 --> 10:38.395
I can't believe I'm hearing this.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.060
Cayden James.

10:40.682 --> 10:42.400
He's the most skilled hacker
the world has ever known.

10:42.684 --> 10:43.856
If he was, I would've heard of him.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.403
No, you wouldn't have,
because he's just that good.

10:45.645 --> 10:46.862
He's a ghost.

10:47.564 --> 10:48.907
He's also the person that formed Helix.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.071
What does that have to do with...

10:50.316 --> 10:51.818
Eight months ago,
he was scooped up by A.R.G.U.S.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.903
Not arrested, not charged, just taken.

10:54.070 --> 10:58.166
And now he's being held without cause.
Being tortured, who knows what else.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.744
And I had to take this off
that A.R.G.U.S. agent so we can free him.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.918
Alena, you killed someone.

11:05.582 --> 11:07.004
Before you get too judgmental,

11:07.250 --> 11:09.924
know you're gonna help me free Cayden
from where A.R.G.U.S. is holding him.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.092
Why would I do that?

11:11.337 --> 11:14.181
Because before he was taken,
Cayden was working on a biometric tracker

11:14.382 --> 11:15.599
that could recognize a heartbeat.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.886
Powerful enough to scan
anywhere in the world.

11:18.261 --> 11:19.854
Anywhere Adrian Chase is.

11:22.974 --> 11:24.100
<i>We have</i> a <i>problem.</i>

11:24.309 --> 11:25.936
- What is it?
- The problem.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.901
After Damien Darhk
took my security implant last year,

11:29.105 --> 11:32.405
I instituted new protocols to prevent
any sensitive A.R.G.U.S. information,

11:32.609 --> 11:35.032
or location
from being accessed by a single person.

11:35.236 --> 11:37.534
Access now requires
two of these security keys.

11:37.739 --> 11:40.458
But Agent Pierce's key wasn't taken.
You found it on him.

11:40.658 --> 11:43.036
- I found a very sophisticated copy.
- Smart.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.791
Extremely. I almost didn't catch it.

11:44.996 --> 11:47.920
If those keys have been compromised,
then they have to be reprogrammed.

11:48.124 --> 11:50.627
The whole point of having the keys
is for them to be unhackable.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.758
Reprogramming takes about 24 hours.

11:52.962 --> 11:56.341
Lyla, clearly,
A.R.G.U.S. security is under attack.

11:57.759 --> 11:59.557
But this doesn't feel like Chase.

11:59.761 --> 12:02.685
And, quite frankly,
that is where we have to keep our focus.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.186
And I sympathize.

12:04.641 --> 12:07.440
But I've got almost all personnel
with keys in lockdown at A.R.G.U.S.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.942
- "Almost"?
- Agent Ditkoff is 20 miles out,

12:10.146 --> 12:11.363
near Port Talbert.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.908
I was hoping your team
could escort her back to A.R.G.U.S.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.824
Oliver, I know you wanna get Chase.
So do I.

12:17.028 --> 12:19.622
But A.R.G.U.S. has always had our backs.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.039
Yes, they have.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.914
Let's call Curtis and Dinah.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.835
Please let Felicity know
where we're going.

12:25.036 --> 12:26.037
Copy that.

12:27.372 --> 12:28.498
Just let me talk
to my friends at A.R.G.U.S.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.925
Maybe we can negotiate
for Cayden's release.

12:31.292 --> 12:32.965
Sorry. It's just funny, you know?

12:33.211 --> 12:34.212
"Negotiate with A.R.G.U.S."

12:34.420 --> 12:37.139
Seriously, I really think they will.
Just hold off on taking the second key.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.513
A.R.G.U.S. won't even admit
they have Cayden.

12:39.717 --> 12:41.264
Besides, plan's already in motion.

12:41.552 --> 12:42.553
What did you do?

12:43.221 --> 12:44.814
Don't worry.
I hired professionals this time.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.106
"Professionals"?

12:46.307 --> 12:47.934
One casualty was enough
for this girl's conscience.

12:48.142 --> 12:49.109
Like mercenaries?

12:49.310 --> 12:50.778
You really can buy anything
on the Internet.

12:52.397 --> 12:54.695
Well, are your Internet thugs
headed to Port Talbert?

12:55.817 --> 12:57.444
Because they're about to
have some company.

13:10.206 --> 13:14.177
Over Terrific here. Or Mr. Watch.
Or Watch Terrific.

13:14.377 --> 13:15.378
Anyway, it'll come to me.

13:15.586 --> 13:16.553
We're on our way.

13:16.754 --> 13:19.758
Right. Seven-hundred feet ahead,
three bogies. Please hurry.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.611
Dinah and I
are a <i>few blocks</i> away.

14:05.136 --> 14:06.979
Hey, John,
I know you have to protect that agent.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.147
We're on our way.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.315
I know you have to protect her,

14:09.515 --> 14:11.483
but I need you to let those guys
get away with her security key.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.027
Wait, what? What?

14:15.146 --> 14:17.240
Hey! Don't move!

14:20.902 --> 14:22.279
Oliver, we have a situation.

14:22.487 --> 14:24.660
I need you to let tango
get away with that security key.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.161
<i>- Why?
- Felicity has information</i>

14:26.366 --> 14:29.040
<i>that we don't have.
Oliver, I need you to stand down.</i>

14:37.960 --> 14:39.257
What the hell was that?

14:39.629 --> 14:40.596
Felicity said we had to.

14:40.797 --> 14:41.798
<i>Why'?</i>

14:43.007 --> 14:44.224
To catch Prometheus.

14:50.264 --> 14:51.641
It's the only way to catch Chase.

14:51.849 --> 14:53.101
No, it's not.

14:53.518 --> 14:55.691
But even if it were, at what cost?

14:55.937 --> 14:57.280
Agent Ditkoff could've been killed.

14:57.480 --> 14:58.447
No, the team was there to make sure.

14:58.648 --> 15:01.242
She could've been killed,
just like Agent Pierce.

15:01.442 --> 15:02.443
I told you, that was an accident.

15:02.652 --> 15:05.280
And now, two keys are in the wind,
and A.R.G.U.S. is vulnerable.

15:05.488 --> 15:06.455
What the hell were you thinking?

15:06.656 --> 15:09.330
That we need to catch
this son of a bitch, no matter what.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.000
Guys, a little support here.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.545
Might be crossing a line, Felicity.

15:16.999 --> 15:20.344
Well, you're the last person on Earth
that gets to give that lecture, Oliver.

15:21.754 --> 15:22.971
Or second to last.

15:23.714 --> 15:26.092
And don't tell me that you don't make
morally questionable choices

15:26.300 --> 15:28.018
so that I don't have to. I have to.

15:28.219 --> 15:29.562
No, you don't, Felicity,
you don't have to.

15:29.887 --> 15:32.265
Lyla's right. There are better ways
for us to find Chase.

15:32.473 --> 15:34.316
Chase has been in the wind for a week.

15:35.226 --> 15:37.399
He was trained by Talia al Ghul.
He knows how to stay in the wind.

15:37.603 --> 15:38.695
What other leads do we have?

15:39.522 --> 15:41.365
How else are we gonna
bring Adrian Chase to justice,

15:41.566 --> 15:43.614
unless A.R.G.U.S. lets go of Cayden James?

15:43.818 --> 15:46.412
- Not a chance.
- Then my only choice is to help Helix.

15:47.196 --> 15:48.368
Your only choice?

15:48.573 --> 15:49.574
Felicity, I thought
we're on the same side.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.705
No, John, I'm on the side
that's gonna put Chase away,

15:51.909 --> 15:53.206
so that he can't hurt anyone ever again.

15:53.411 --> 15:54.458
<i>Hey, Felicity.</i>

15:54.745 --> 15:57.498
Let her go, man. Now is not the time.

16:05.506 --> 16:06.849
You wanted to see me, hoss?

16:07.091 --> 16:08.638
Yeah. First, close the door.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.396
Second, what have I told you
about calling me "hoss"?

16:15.600 --> 16:17.443
- Don%.
- Right.

16:17.977 --> 16:18.978
Yeah.

16:20.229 --> 16:21.276
Just sit down.

16:26.277 --> 16:27.620
Are you firing me?

16:29.489 --> 16:32.038
Rene, there was a time when
I would've loved to hear you ask me that.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.584
But no, lam not firing you.

16:34.243 --> 16:35.586
I wanna talk to you about...

16:36.537 --> 16:37.538
Zoe.

16:39.415 --> 16:40.382
Yeah, your daughter.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.210
Yeah, I know her name, hoss.

16:43.044 --> 16:45.547
I thought I told you
I don't wanna talk about her.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.007
Well, that's too bad,

16:47.507 --> 16:49.805
'cause you happen to be working
for a guy who would give anything

16:50.009 --> 16:51.477
to be with his daughter again.

16:54.388 --> 16:55.640
What do you want from me, man?

16:55.848 --> 16:56.974
An explanation.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.519
<i>I looked into your case.</i>

16:59.936 --> 17:01.609
You have full visitation rights

17:01.812 --> 17:04.691
as long as you're accompanied
by a court-appointed guardian.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.528
And there's no record
of you ever visiting.

17:08.819 --> 17:09.911
Please...

17:10.613 --> 17:12.160
Just leave this alone, man.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.325
I think we both know I'm not gonna.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.286
So why don't we just skip to the part
where you tell me

17:16.493 --> 17:18.371
why you do not wanna see your daughter?

17:20.998 --> 17:22.124
Okay.

17:23.376 --> 17:26.003
When Curtis told me about
his lawyer friend, I got excited, okay?

17:26.212 --> 17:28.385
Yeah, yeah, all right.
And then what happened?

17:28.631 --> 17:31.510
I remembered why they took Zoe
away from me in the first place.

17:32.593 --> 17:36.018
Yeah, sure, I could visit her

17:36.264 --> 17:38.312
with a court-appointed guardian,
like you said.

17:38.516 --> 17:39.517
You wanna know why that is?

17:41.435 --> 17:42.402
'Cause I'm bad news.

17:42.603 --> 17:44.856
- Yeah, you're an acquired taste, for sure.
- I hurt her!

17:47.233 --> 17:48.450
What do you mean, you hurt her?

17:57.368 --> 17:59.496
I was reheating some soup for her.

18:03.291 --> 18:05.089
It's just about all I could make her.

18:08.379 --> 18:12.009
And it was on the stove,
and I passed out drunk.

18:15.636 --> 18:18.389
Poor Zoe, she's trying to grab it,
and pulls it down,

18:18.598 --> 18:20.475
and it burns her hand real bad.

18:22.685 --> 18:24.653
And it was her crying that woke me up.

18:27.189 --> 18:28.782
Zoe deserves better than me.

18:29.734 --> 18:30.781
End of story.

18:31.986 --> 18:33.909
Rene. Rene. Get back...

18:38.659 --> 18:43.085
Meet prisoner 38085, aka Cayden James.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.249
What are you holding him on?

18:45.458 --> 18:46.926
He's a person of interest.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.800
So, no crime,
I'm guessing no trial, either.

18:50.338 --> 18:51.931
Do you have something
you wanna say to me, Johnnie?

18:52.632 --> 18:54.134
Not right now, Lyla.

18:54.425 --> 18:55.927
<i>There's something
we're not considering.</i>

18:56.469 --> 18:58.062
What if Felicity is right?

18:59.180 --> 19:00.397
She might be right.

19:00.848 --> 19:03.567
We give James a terminal,
we make him find Chase,

19:03.768 --> 19:06.237
and then we hand him back to Helix.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.902
I know you want Chase
off the board, Oliver,

19:09.440 --> 19:11.784
but Cayden James
is as dangerous as a loose nuke.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.486
I can't put him back in play.

19:13.694 --> 19:15.822
Helix has compromised your security.

19:16.113 --> 19:18.957
And now they have hired mercenaries
that are gonna go after A.R.G.U.S.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.159
to get James out.

19:20.409 --> 19:21.661
Which means we go after them first.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.788
Curtis has intel as to where
their base of operations is.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.794
And we'd be going in completely blind.

19:25.998 --> 19:29.172
We have a greater chance of success
if we let Helix come to us.

19:30.336 --> 19:31.588
Wait, Lyla.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.679
You wanna set a trap for Helix
and use James as the bait?

19:36.967 --> 19:39.436
I don't think I need to tell either of you
how dangerous Helix is.

19:39.637 --> 19:41.264
This is our chance to take them down.

19:43.140 --> 19:45.108
This is happening
with or without your help.

19:46.352 --> 19:48.946
I'll let you boys
wrap your head around that.

19:56.487 --> 19:57.784
We have to get Felicity out of Helix.

19:57.988 --> 19:59.114
We can't let her get involved in this.

19:59.323 --> 20:00.666
You mean any more involved.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.618
We knew she was into something.

20:03.119 --> 20:04.496
We knew it was bad.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.298
We just let her get in deeper.

20:08.958 --> 20:11.177
Oliver, grief can make people
do crazy things.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.004
No one knows that better than you and me.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.720
But I'm not the one she was gonna marry.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.056
What's your point?

20:24.306 --> 20:25.398
My point is...

20:28.310 --> 20:30.062
Oliver, look. Maybe we should've
talked her out of Helix.

20:30.730 --> 20:33.324
Maybe not. I don't know.
But the point is, we're here now.

20:33.524 --> 20:35.367
And you're the only one
she will listen to.

20:38.237 --> 20:42.743
I'm not sure how much credibility
I have with her.

20:43.367 --> 20:46.337
You both wanna catch Chase, right?
You have that in common.

20:47.747 --> 20:50.717
Which tells me you are the only one
who can pull her back from the brink.

20:58.174 --> 20:59.175
Oh.

20:59.717 --> 21:01.344
- Hi.
- Hey.

21:02.011 --> 21:03.558
Nice of you to use
the front door for once.

21:04.889 --> 21:06.061
May I come in, please?

21:06.390 --> 21:07.516
Actually, I was just leaving.

21:07.725 --> 21:08.851
I can see that.

21:11.729 --> 21:12.855
Sure.

21:17.568 --> 21:20.196
Looks like you're not sitting
behind a keyboard for this one.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.207
- Can you blame me?
- No.

21:25.075 --> 21:28.545
I, more than probably anyone else,
understand what it's like

21:28.704 --> 21:30.923
to be willing to do whatever it takes
to stop Chase.

21:31.207 --> 21:32.208
Then let me do it.

21:32.416 --> 21:34.089
Let me just tell you
how I'm seeing things.

21:35.085 --> 21:37.804
You're willing to do whatever it takes
to stop Chase

21:38.088 --> 21:42.093
because I was willing to do
whatever it takes to save this city...

21:43.761 --> 21:45.263
And that created him.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.394
Okay, so it's ironic. That's what it is.

21:47.598 --> 21:48.724
It doesn't have to be.

21:49.391 --> 21:51.985
You see, we can think of
another way to find him,

21:52.228 --> 21:54.572
and then we can find
another way to stop him.

21:54.730 --> 21:56.732
Okay, how? The SCPD tip line?

21:56.941 --> 22:00.070
No, that's not gonna work this time,
Oliver. We both know that.

22:01.153 --> 22:02.621
Look, this is our only chance.

22:03.405 --> 22:04.952
And this is me asking you.

22:07.076 --> 22:08.453
Don't do this.

22:10.412 --> 22:13.757
For the past four years, I have
watched you do whatever you had to,

22:13.958 --> 22:16.586
whatever it took,
to stop the people threatening this city.

22:16.794 --> 22:19.138
How can you stand there
and not ask me to do the same thing?

22:19.338 --> 22:23.263
Because over the past four years,
you, more than anyone else,

22:24.593 --> 22:26.766
has seen the toll that it has taken on me.

22:26.929 --> 22:29.102
- And I told you...
- And I understand, I agree

22:29.306 --> 22:31.525
that I should not shelter you
from making hard decisions.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.610
But you wanna talk irony? Fine.

22:35.312 --> 22:37.610
You are willing to sell your soul

22:39.024 --> 22:42.494
to destroy a threat that I created.

22:44.655 --> 22:45.656
How did...

22:47.992 --> 22:49.665
One of the reasons I fell in love with you

22:49.869 --> 22:52.668
is because you're always willing
to do what was right,

22:53.038 --> 22:54.961
no matter what the cost.

22:55.499 --> 22:58.127
Even if it's unbearably hard.

23:00.462 --> 23:02.510
It's what makes you, you.

23:05.175 --> 23:07.018
So how can I be any different?

23:09.138 --> 23:14.565
You have sacrificed your soul
for the team, for the city, and for me.

23:16.520 --> 23:21.071
You don't have to
carry that burden any longer.

23:24.361 --> 23:25.487
Let me do it.

23:27.698 --> 23:28.915
Felicity, l...

23:33.537 --> 23:35.005
I can't.

23:38.208 --> 23:39.505
Then you'll have to stop me.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.722
This facility has eight ingress points.

23:51.931 --> 23:54.229
I've got six-man teams stationed at each,

23:54.892 --> 23:57.190
perimeter squads keeping watch,
and drones flying surveillance.

23:57.394 --> 23:58.896
Helix has to be ready for all of that.

23:59.855 --> 24:03.530
That's why we're here.
Added support and the element of surprise.

24:03.692 --> 24:06.366
You think Felicity will be surprised
that we're trying to stop her?

24:06.570 --> 24:09.870
Actually, I am kind of surprised.
I mean, you and her have a history.

24:10.074 --> 24:11.576
Just kind of like,
"We're against each other."

24:11.784 --> 24:13.536
Let's have you and Dinah
patrol the southwest.

24:13.702 --> 24:14.749
Stay on comms, okay?

24:15.037 --> 24:16.289
- Quick question.
- Mmm-hmm.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.461
What do we do if she shows up tonight?

24:22.586 --> 24:23.587
We stop her.

24:30.386 --> 24:34.232
Logistics calculates a 46% likelihood
they'll try to breach through here.

24:34.431 --> 24:37.275
Okay. Then we'll be ready for them.

24:39.269 --> 24:41.317
We're not expecting Helix
for another seven minutes,

24:41.563 --> 24:42.780
so would you like to use that time

24:42.982 --> 24:45.576
to tell me what I've done
that's got you so pissed off?

24:49.071 --> 24:50.573
Lyla, I'm not pissed off.

24:51.740 --> 24:53.117
But I am concerned.

24:54.076 --> 24:56.579
What did Felicity mean
when she made that crack

24:56.745 --> 24:57.917
about you crossing a line?

24:59.498 --> 25:01.421
I can't even begin to fathom
the amount of crap

25:01.625 --> 25:03.673
that Helix has put
into Felicity's head, Johnnie.

25:04.128 --> 25:06.756
But Lyla,
holding Cayden James without due process,

25:07.006 --> 25:08.349
that's not a bunch of crap.

25:08.590 --> 25:11.469
Cayden James is 20 times
more dangerous than Snowden.

25:11.677 --> 25:13.771
We caught him trying to hack
an A.R.G.U.S. transponder.

25:13.929 --> 25:16.432
If he got in, every NOC agent we have
could be at risk.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.813
That sounds a whole lot
like Amanda Waller.

25:19.018 --> 25:22.864
Waller's decisions seem a lot less wrong
from this side of the desk, Johnnie.

25:23.147 --> 25:24.319
You can't judge me for that.

25:25.649 --> 25:26.946
I'm not judging.

25:29.319 --> 25:30.320
I'm just worried.

25:32.698 --> 25:34.792
Felicity Smoak is one of
the best people I've ever known,

25:34.950 --> 25:37.624
and she's gone over to the dark side.

25:39.705 --> 25:42.049
I don't want that to happen to my wife.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.979
I've done a lot of illegal things,

25:56.138 --> 25:58.140
but none of them
ever required heavy weaponry.

25:58.307 --> 26:00.309
Or any weaponry.

26:00.476 --> 26:03.480
You know, I found the transition
between hacker to vigilante

26:03.687 --> 26:05.155
to be surprisingly straightforward.

26:05.856 --> 26:07.028
You're gonna do great.

26:07.357 --> 26:09.075
Besides, you have enough
firepower here to invade Russia.

26:09.318 --> 26:10.695
Well, hopefully, we won't have to.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.155
I think we might.

26:13.197 --> 26:14.244
They know we're coming.

26:15.157 --> 26:16.158
I'm not worried.

26:16.867 --> 26:18.084
In case you need them.

26:18.827 --> 26:19.874
No.

26:20.871 --> 26:22.669
I mean, even if we do, I'm not using that.

26:22.873 --> 26:23.840
A.R.G.U.S. will have guns.

26:24.041 --> 26:25.384
I thought you said
no one was gonna get hurt.

26:25.667 --> 26:28.386
If we do this right, no one will.

26:30.005 --> 26:31.427
Wait for my signal.

26:38.722 --> 26:41.020
What's so important, hoss?
I was gonna call it a night.

26:43.352 --> 26:44.353
Daddy!

26:45.187 --> 26:46.188
Sweetheart.

26:47.064 --> 26:48.031
I told you.

26:48.232 --> 26:50.906
Hey, you're not the only one around here
that doesn't listen to orders.

26:53.862 --> 26:54.954
Who's he?

26:55.781 --> 26:59.206
This is Quentin, Quentin Lance,
Daddy's friend.

26:59.409 --> 27:00.956
But I call him "hoss."

27:02.538 --> 27:04.131
He arranged this little visit.

27:04.706 --> 27:05.958
Thank you, hoss.

27:07.417 --> 27:09.966
- I missed you.
- I missed you so much.

27:10.963 --> 27:12.431
I missed you more.

27:12.923 --> 27:16.223
Dang, girl, you're getting so big.
Look at you.

27:16.927 --> 27:19.396
Pretty soon you're gonna be
driving Pops to the games.

27:19.555 --> 27:20.898
Isn't that right?

27:21.265 --> 27:23.267
Tell your daddy what you're doing
at school now, Zoe.

27:24.893 --> 27:25.940
I made the hockey team.

27:26.228 --> 27:28.947
What? No way. What position you playing?

27:29.148 --> 27:31.276
- Goalie.
- That's my girl.

27:31.567 --> 27:33.069
Just like your pops.

27:33.485 --> 27:34.486
Oh...

27:34.903 --> 27:36.450
That's so good. I'm proud of you.

27:38.448 --> 27:39.791
Can we go home now?

27:47.249 --> 27:49.593
I'm sorry, sweetheart, but not today.

27:50.586 --> 27:51.633
<i>Why'?</i>

27:54.965 --> 27:58.435
Sweetheart, last time you were with me,
you got hurt, baby.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.012
It was an accident.

28:00.929 --> 28:02.681
When can I go home to Daddy?

28:05.184 --> 28:07.482
I don't know, sweetheart.

28:08.770 --> 28:09.987
<i>Soon, peanut.</i>

28:11.523 --> 28:13.821
There's a lawyer friend
Daddy's friend knows.

28:14.651 --> 28:17.120
And Daddy's decided
he's gonna talk to him,

28:17.321 --> 28:18.664
and you're gonna come home with me.

28:20.032 --> 28:23.377
I promise. Okay? I promise.

28:35.130 --> 28:36.723
I thought you were
standing post with Lyla.

28:36.965 --> 28:39.218
Seemed like a good idea
to put some space between us.

28:39.843 --> 28:43.188
Felicity isn't the only lady
who thinks the ends justifies the means.

28:43.513 --> 28:46.312
When Lyla and Felicity Smoak
are willing to cross the line...

28:46.475 --> 28:48.352
Makes you wonder
if there even is one, right?

28:49.019 --> 28:50.145
We got incoming.

28:50.896 --> 28:52.148
Tango's in the field.

28:52.397 --> 28:53.523
Copy that.

28:56.485 --> 28:57.532
What's that?

28:58.528 --> 29:00.656
Think of it as a weaponized tablet,

29:00.989 --> 29:03.412
preloaded with Address Resolution
Protocol Spoofing.

29:03.659 --> 29:06.833
The A.R.G.U.S. site is protected
by microchipped gun turrets.

29:07.037 --> 29:09.165
Right. This will shut them down?

29:12.334 --> 29:13.551
You sure you're ready for this?

29:13.877 --> 29:14.878
Let's do this.

29:15.671 --> 29:17.344
Bogie's on site. Want us to intercept?

29:17.547 --> 29:19.549
Negative. Draw them in closer.

29:44.533 --> 29:45.750
Identification, please.

30:05.971 --> 30:07.097
It's not them.

30:07.556 --> 30:08.523
Lyla, sitrep.

30:08.724 --> 30:11.102
The van checked out. It wasn't Helix.

30:12.853 --> 30:13.854
We have a problem.

30:23.113 --> 30:24.660
Wait, this isn't A.R.G.U.S.

30:24.865 --> 30:28.119
No, it is. Just not the site
A.R.G.U.S. expected us to hit.

30:30.996 --> 30:31.997
What problem?

30:32.205 --> 30:33.957
Helix is about to extract Cayden James.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.089
- How? They're not here.
- Neither is Cayden James.

30:36.293 --> 30:37.340
And you didn't tell us?

30:37.669 --> 30:39.296
I didn't think it was necessary.

30:39.838 --> 30:40.964
Where is he?

30:41.214 --> 30:44.468
At an off-the-books black site,
12 miles away.

30:56.480 --> 30:59.108
<i>Damn it, Lyla, you should've
let us in on the plan.</i>

30:59.316 --> 31:02.365
Helix wasn't supposed to know
about the black site. No one was.

31:02.569 --> 31:03.741
<i>That's because it's illegal.</i>

31:03.945 --> 31:05.413
I'm not discussing this, Johnnie.

31:05.822 --> 31:08.166
Get your head in the game.
You're two minutes out.

31:22.631 --> 31:23.848
<i>Where has this tablet
been all my life?</i>

31:24.049 --> 31:26.928
I made it special for you.
So much better than a friendship bracelet.

31:32.057 --> 31:33.434
How are we gonna find Cayden James?

31:33.642 --> 31:35.019
I know he's inside
one of these containers,

31:35.227 --> 31:36.274
but I don't know exactly which one.

31:36.478 --> 31:37.604
Can you check to see
if there's a site map?

31:37.896 --> 31:38.897
Mmm-hmm.

31:39.398 --> 31:40.615
Okay.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.034
<i>Whatever A.R.G.U.S. is keeping in there,
they wanna keep secure.</i>

31:47.739 --> 31:48.786
Or whoever.

31:58.375 --> 32:01.549
Two air-gapped, unhackable keys.
It's beautiful tech, really.

32:01.753 --> 32:03.881
Free Cayden James now.
Admire A.R.G.U.S. tech later.

32:04.089 --> 32:05.090
Right.

32:11.138 --> 32:12.185
- One...
- Two...

32:12.389 --> 32:13.390
Three.

32:18.895 --> 32:19.942
Cayden?

32:24.484 --> 32:28.330
Hey. Hey. It's okay, this is a rescue.

32:28.530 --> 32:30.077
We gotta move.
Team Arrow will be here any minute.

32:30.574 --> 32:32.326
I doubt that very much.
They have no clue we're here.

32:34.661 --> 32:37.210
Do not say "I told you so."
Meet us out back in five.

32:37.456 --> 32:38.457
Where are we going?

32:39.082 --> 32:40.459
We're gonna go say hi to your friends.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.995
Don't grab a woman
unless you have permission, dumbass.

33:17.871 --> 33:18.918
Freeze!

33:21.500 --> 33:22.501
I've got Felicity's friend.

33:23.460 --> 33:24.632
I have a name, you know.

33:24.836 --> 33:27.806
Turn around. Put your hands on your head.

33:28.089 --> 33:30.638
- Do it!
- Okay. Turning.

33:48.985 --> 33:50.328
You wanna see what else they can do?

33:55.325 --> 33:56.952
Next one goes in his head.

33:57.244 --> 33:59.838
Then it'll have to go through me. Go!

34:00.163 --> 34:01.289
Get out of the way!

34:01.957 --> 34:05.211
You know I can't do that.
I was really hoping you wouldn't!

34:06.836 --> 34:08.007
Oliver, don't move.

34:09.255 --> 34:12.351
That is a 30-kilowatt spectral beam laser.
It'll cut you to the bone.

34:16.012 --> 34:17.434
Curtis will let you out.

34:22.351 --> 34:23.353
I'm sorry.

34:25.563 --> 34:28.784
I am. I'm really hoping that you're gonna
understand after we get Chase.

34:32.946 --> 34:34.038
Don't count on it.

34:48.503 --> 34:50.380
On the bright side, we were suited up.

34:50.880 --> 34:53.303
I mean, I'm glad Cayden James
doesn't know that, you know,

34:53.507 --> 34:54.679
we were trying to keep him in prison.

34:54.884 --> 34:56.386
Because if he did, I would be scared

34:56.594 --> 34:58.563
of my refrigerator, my car,
my alarm clock.

34:58.763 --> 35:00.515
And could we talk
about elevators for a second?

35:00.724 --> 35:03.193
Because I think I'm gonna be
taking the stairs for a while.

35:03.393 --> 35:05.896
It's just better for your health.

35:06.980 --> 35:09.529
Also, on the bright side, you know,
so, just think about that.

35:09.733 --> 35:11.485
This wasn't a prison, Curtis.

35:11.693 --> 35:15.414
This was an illegal black site
on American soil led by my wife.

35:21.369 --> 35:22.791
Also, no A.R.G.U.S. casualty...

35:22.996 --> 35:25.966
No A.R.G.U.S. casualties.
All the mercs used rubber bullets, so...

35:28.877 --> 35:30.345
What do you wanna do about Felicity?

35:30.629 --> 35:32.051
There is nothing to do.

35:33.965 --> 35:38.516
She put herself in front of a bullet
in order to take down Chase.

35:39.721 --> 35:41.598
Until that happens,
I don't know what to say to her.

35:41.931 --> 35:44.354
In the meantime,
we drink to her speedy success. I mean...

35:44.768 --> 35:46.896
In the meantime, I think we go home.

35:47.270 --> 35:49.272
Why? There's more glasses in the bunk...

35:49.773 --> 35:52.652
You wanna drink by your... Okay.
Yeah, right. I mean, yeah.

35:52.859 --> 35:54.953
Thank you both very much for tonight.

36:11.878 --> 36:12.970
Yep.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.423
You're working late.

36:15.048 --> 36:17.517
Well, I thought I'd stick around
for my thank you.

36:17.884 --> 36:19.557
You had that coming, for sure.

36:20.428 --> 36:21.645
Along with an apology.

36:21.846 --> 36:24.770
Here I was, thinking you didn't know
what an apology was.

36:26.142 --> 36:29.021
I guess you can
teach a dog some new tricks.

36:29.312 --> 36:30.313
Even wild ones.

36:32.273 --> 36:34.241
I spoke to Curtis' lawyer friend.

36:35.318 --> 36:36.740
I put things in motion.

36:38.071 --> 36:39.163
Good for you.

36:40.323 --> 36:42.667
You know, that Zoe,
she's a hell of a little girl, and...

36:44.035 --> 36:46.129
You know, she deserves her dad.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.131
<i>You know, father to father,</i>

36:50.500 --> 36:51.717
I gotta tell you,

36:53.044 --> 36:55.342
her dad deserves to be with her.

36:56.089 --> 36:57.306
Thank you.

36:58.925 --> 37:00.393
That's what I was waiting for.

37:02.762 --> 37:05.311
All right, how about
a celebratory club soda?

37:05.765 --> 37:06.937
I'm buying.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.978
Hey, hold on a second, hoss.
How about something stronger?

37:10.186 --> 37:12.780
You keep calling me "hoss,"
I'll show you something stronger.

37:19.362 --> 37:20.488
Hello?

37:23.491 --> 37:24.492
<i>Hey, Felicity.</i>

37:25.034 --> 37:27.753
Hi. Where are you? Are you okay?

37:28.246 --> 37:31.671
<i>We're safe.
Thank you for all of your help.</i>

37:32.667 --> 37:35.011
<i>But here's the thing.</i>

37:35.211 --> 37:40.559
<i>Your connection to the Green Arrow
and his team, it's a liability.</i>

37:41.217 --> 37:44.596
Yeah. Well, once we get Chase,
he'll see all the good Helix can do.

37:45.513 --> 37:47.891
<i>I'm sorry, but we just can't risk it.</i>

37:49.184 --> 37:50.606
<i>Especially not with
Cayden back in the fold</i>

37:50.810 --> 37:51.902
<i>and A.R.G.U.S. looking for him.</i>

37:53.313 --> 37:55.736
<i>I loved getting to work with you.</i>

37:57.108 --> 38:00.157
<i>Meeting your heroes,
it turns out it's not so bad after all.</i>

38:01.613 --> 38:04.366
<i>But we left something for you. Look down.</i>

38:06.326 --> 38:07.327
<i>Up a little bit.</i>

38:08.953 --> 38:10.205
<i>Little bit to the right.</i>

38:10.789 --> 38:11.790
This?

38:13.875 --> 38:14.876
What is it?

38:15.084 --> 38:17.337
<i>Some on-the-fly coding from Mr. James.</i>

38:18.838 --> 38:20.761
<i>Told you he was the best there ever was.</i>

38:22.509 --> 38:23.761
<i>Take care, Felicity.</i>

38:24.302 --> 38:25.394
Yeah, you, too.

38:43.822 --> 38:44.914
Johnnie.

38:48.451 --> 38:50.124
We need to talk about this.

38:54.290 --> 38:56.463
I don't think that's a good idea, Lyla.

38:58.586 --> 39:01.430
- I could say something I might regret.
- John.

39:01.631 --> 39:03.929
When you said that you were
taking over for Waller,

39:04.217 --> 39:05.764
you said you wouldn't become her.

39:05.969 --> 39:07.141
I told you.

39:07.720 --> 39:10.269
It's more complicated when you're sitting
on the other side of the...

39:10.473 --> 39:11.474
What the hell is more complicated?

39:11.683 --> 39:15.404
You're holding someone
with no lawyer, no trial, no justice.

39:15.603 --> 39:17.321
And the world is safer for it.

39:18.815 --> 39:20.158
It could be safer.

39:24.904 --> 39:26.497
But it's not better.

39:28.324 --> 39:32.750
The woman I love could never do this.
Lyla, this job has changed you.

39:36.875 --> 39:37.967
Maybe.

39:39.460 --> 39:41.133
But maybe the world's changed.

39:42.964 --> 39:44.432
It's gotten even worse, Johnnie.

39:44.632 --> 39:47.511
It's gotten worse and uglier,
and we do what we can

39:47.719 --> 39:49.642
to protect the people we love.

39:51.681 --> 39:54.150
Lam not ashamed of what I did.

39:55.768 --> 39:57.862
Of what I'm still going to do.

40:00.523 --> 40:02.696
We've been down this road before,
haven't we?

40:07.405 --> 40:08.907
We know where this fight takes us.

40:13.703 --> 40:15.080
So let's stop it.

40:17.206 --> 40:18.583
Move forward.

40:21.294 --> 40:22.887
I don't know if I can.

40:45.610 --> 40:46.987
- Is that it?
- Yep.

40:47.195 --> 40:49.118
James' magic tracker to find Chase?

40:49.322 --> 40:51.871
Biometric tracker, yes.

40:52.241 --> 40:55.370
Nobody from A.R.G.U.S.
was seriously injured,

40:55.870 --> 40:56.871
in case you were wondering.

40:57.580 --> 40:58.752
Helix froze me out.

41:00.541 --> 41:01.542
It's over.

41:02.043 --> 41:03.135
I'm sorry.

41:04.045 --> 41:06.298
I thought you weren't ever
gonna lie to me again.

41:08.007 --> 41:09.259
I'm not lying.

41:10.510 --> 41:11.636
I'm sorry.

41:12.178 --> 41:15.523
I know that they gave you
a sense of belonging

41:15.723 --> 41:17.191
- that maybe I haven't...
- No.

41:19.227 --> 41:20.524
You didn't back my play.

41:21.562 --> 41:23.280
I was worried.

41:23.481 --> 41:24.698
You don't trust me.

41:26.859 --> 41:29.453
After all these years,
all of the times that I supported you,

41:29.654 --> 41:32.908
even when I didn't agree,
you couldn't do the same for me.

41:34.909 --> 41:36.001
What's that?

41:37.495 --> 41:38.997
Tracker's honing in on Chase's location.

41:42.792 --> 41:43.918
Where is he?

41:46.379 --> 41:48.052
Chase. He's here.
