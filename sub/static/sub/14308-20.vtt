WEBVTT

00:09.567 --> 00:10.833
- OH.

00:10.867 --> 00:13.400
ALL DONE.
IT'S GONNA BE AWESOME.

00:15.200 --> 00:17.333
THERE'S NOTHING QUITE LIKE
SPENDING TIME OUTDOORS,

00:17.367 --> 00:19.067
AT ONE WITH NATURE.

00:19.100 --> 00:23.467
- 60-INCH FLAT SCREEN
FOR FRANKIE HATHAWAY.

00:23.500 --> 00:25.567
- OUT BACK IN THE TREE,
BETWEEN THE MASSAGE CHAIR

00:25.600 --> 00:29.400
AND SNOW CONE MACHINE.

00:29.433 --> 00:31.733
- OH, MY GOSH,

00:35.100 --> 00:36.667

00:48.700 --> 00:51.167
- GO AWAY! SHOO. SHOO.
- TAYLOR!

00:51.200 --> 00:53.367
IT IS NOT POLITE
TO EAVESDROP.

00:53.400 --> 00:54.733
THIS IS
A PROFESSIONAL ESTABLISHMENT,

00:54.767 --> 00:56.767
AND WE RESPECT
OUR CUSTOMERS' PRIVACY.

00:56.800 --> 00:59.067

00:59.100 --> 01:01.133

01:01.167 --> 01:03.433
- MOVE IT.

01:03.467 --> 01:05.300
THAT CAN FIT
30 HUNGRY FOOTBALL PLAYERS

01:05.333 --> 01:08.567

FOR THE NEXT FOUR MONTHS.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.800
- GENTLEMEN,
I COULDN'T HELP OVERHEARING

01:10.833 --> 01:12.667
YOU NEED A PLACE

MIGHT I SUGGEST
THE NUMBER ONE BAKERY

01:15.433 --> 01:19.167

BUT THIS IS
ABOUT YOUR HAPPINESS.

01:50.733 --> 01:52.533
- HEY, FRANKIE,
CHECK IT OUT.

01:52.567 --> 01:56.067
I FINALLY MASTERED
A TERRIFYING GHOST ROAR.

01:56.100 --> 02:00.667
- HOLD ON, LET ME LOWER
MY EXPECTATIONS.

02:00.700 --> 02:03.133
OKAY, GO.

02:06.500 --> 02:11.267

MY DAD WITH ONE GOOD SCARE.

02:26.233 --> 02:27.767
HE'S NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING.

02:29.533 --> 02:32.267
MY DAD IS COMING TO VISIT!
MY DAD IS COMING TO VISIT!

02:32.300 --> 02:35.633

TO VISIT?

03:22.200 --> 03:24.167
- HE'S DROPPING BY
FOR A FEW HOURS

03:24.200 --> 03:25.800
ON HIS WAY
TO HIS FISHING TRIP.

03:25.833 --> 03:28.500
- OH, AWESOME!

03:28.533 --> 03:33.133
YOU KNOW, HE PASSED HIS AMAZING
SENSE OF STYLE DOWN TO ME.

03:33.167 --> 03:36.533
- AND HIS SUPERIOR
GHOSTING SKILLS DOWN TO ME.

03:36.567 --> 03:38.800
BAM!

03:38.833 --> 03:42.067
I'M NOT A THREE-HEADED BEAST
WITH SCARY FANGS, AM I?

03:42.100 --> 03:44.600
- NO, BUT YOUR SPRINKLES
ARE PRETTY.

03:44.633 --> 03:47.700
- AW.

03:47.733 --> 03:51.067
- WELL, WE CAN'T WAIT
TO MEET YOUR DAD.

03:51.067 --> 03:54.300
YOU CAN'T MEET HIM.

03:54.333 --> 03:56.533
DUKE PRESTON IS A OLD-SCHOOL,
LEVEL 12 GHOST

03:56.567 --> 03:58.600
WHO THINKS HUMANS
ARE ONLY GOOD FOR SCARING.

03:58.633 --> 04:01.700
IF HE KNEW WE WERE LIVING
WITH YOU GUYS, HE'D FREAK OUT.

04:01.733 --> 04:05.433
- RAY, I HAVE NEVER SEEN YOU
SO FRAZZLED.

04:05.467 --> 04:08.400
- YEAH.
YOU'RE LIKE MOM IN A VEST.

04:10.600 --> 04:14.267
- DEFINITELY.
WAIT, WHAT?

04:14.300 --> 04:16.833
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
THIS USED TO BE HIS HOUSE.

04:16.867 --> 04:18.667
HE EXPECTED ME
TO KEEP UP THE TRADITIONS

04:18.700 --> 04:20.367
OF SCARING PEOPLE AWAY.

04:20.400 --> 04:21.733
- WELL,
WHY DON'T WE JUST STAY

04:21.767 --> 04:23.333
OUT OF THE HOUSE
WHILE HE'S HERE?

04:23.367 --> 04:25.133
- THAT'D BE GREAT,
BUT HOW WOULD WE EXPLAIN

04:25.167 --> 04:28.433
ALL OF YOUR STUFF
BEING IN THE HOUSE?

04:28.467 --> 04:30.333
- WE COULD SAY
WE'RE JUST MOVING IN.

04:30.367 --> 04:32.567
THEN YOU GUYS CAN PRETEND
TO SCARE US AWAY.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.167
- YEAH, WE CAN HANG OUT
IN FRANKIE'S TREE HOUSE

04:34.200 --> 04:35.167
UNTIL HE'S GONE.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.467
- HOW AM I GOING TO PLAN

04:36.500 --> 04:38.700
AN ENTIRE PEP RALLY
FROM A TREE HOUSE?

04:38.733 --> 04:41.533
- I HAVE HIGH-SPEED WIRELESS,
VIDEO CONFERENCING,

04:41.567 --> 04:43.333
AND A 3-D PRINTER.

04:43.367 --> 04:46.267
I THINK YOU'LL GET BY.

04:46.300 --> 04:49.233
- THIS COULD WORK.
THANKS, YOU GUYS.

04:49.267 --> 04:51.667
WHOA, DAD'LL BE HERE
IN A HOUR.

04:51.700 --> 04:55.700
I BETTER CHANGE.

04:57.600 --> 05:00.367
THIS HAPPENS
WHENEVER I'M NERVOUS.

05:00.400 --> 05:05.167
NOT SO FUN, IS IT?

05:11.433 --> 05:15.133
WELL PLAYED, CAPTAIN.
WELL PLAYED.

05:19.300 --> 05:22.100
- DON'T YOU HAVE ONE PICTURE
WHERE YOUR DAD IS SMILING?

05:22.133 --> 05:24.133
- THIS IS HIM SMILING.

05:24.167 --> 05:27.767
IT WAS TAKEN
THE DAY I WAS BORN.

05:28.900 --> 05:31.633
- IT'S NICE.

05:33.133 --> 05:35.767
- OKAY, PEOPLE,
LEVEL 12 GHOST ON THE WAY.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.800
LET'S MAKE
THIS REHEARSAL COUNT.

05:37.833 --> 05:40.633
I WROTE UP SOME SCRIPTS
FOR US TO FOLLOW.

05:40.667 --> 05:43.767
- WAIT, I DON'T HAVE ANY LINES
IN THIS SCENE.

05:43.800 --> 05:46.667
- OOPS.

05:46.700 --> 05:48.733
- I'VE BEEN FLESHING OUT
MY CHARACTER'S BACKSTORY.

05:48.767 --> 05:50.733
A GORGEOUS, TALENTED,
YOUNG WOMAN FROM NEW YORK,

05:50.767 --> 05:52.300
TRAVELING SOUTH
WITH HER TWO DAUGHTERS

05:52.333 --> 05:53.667
ON A JOURNEY
OF SELF-DISCOVERY--

05:53.700 --> 05:57.067
- MOM, STICK TO THE SCRIPT.

05:57.100 --> 05:58.567
HERE YOU GO, TEXTY.

05:58.600 --> 06:02.600
- KEEP IT--TOO BUSY ORDERING
PEP RALLY DECORATIONS.

06:02.633 --> 06:04.200
AND SOME NEW SHOES.

06:04.233 --> 06:07.267
- FINE.
HERE'S THE SCENE.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.667
WE STEP OUT OF THE ELEVATOR,
TAKE IN OUR NEW HOME,

06:09.700 --> 06:11.633
THEN YOU GUYS THROW OUT
A FEW COOL GHOST EFFECTS.

06:11.667 --> 06:14.633
LOUIE, NO FARTING.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.467
- MM.

06:19.500 --> 06:23.367
- I HAVE TO SAY,
THIS IS VERY EMOTIONAL FOR ME,

06:23.400 --> 06:26.100
RELIVING THAT DAY
YOU GUYS FIRST MOVED IN.

06:26.133 --> 06:28.367
IT WAS A SPECIAL TIME.

06:29.600 --> 06:33.867
- GRANDPA'S HERE!

06:33.900 --> 06:36.767
- HE'S EARLY!
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

06:36.800 --> 06:39.433
- WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WING IT.
- RAY, RELAX.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.733
OUR LITTLE PLAY HERE
IS GOING TO BE VERY CONVINCING.

06:41.767 --> 06:43.633
I'VE BEEN
IN THREE CANADIAN INFOMERCIALS.

06:43.667 --> 06:46.133
I THINK I CAN HANDLE THIS.

06:51.267 --> 06:53.600
both: GRANDDAD!
- AH!

06:53.633 --> 06:55.500
GET OVER HERE,
YOU LITTLE GOBLINS!

06:59.633 --> 07:02.100
WHERE'S YOUR FATHER?

07:02.133 --> 07:03.600
- HERE I AM, DAD.

07:03.633 --> 07:08.200
WELL, MOST OF ME.
LITTLE HELP?

07:08.233 --> 07:11.400
- IT'S OKAY, SON.
KEEP PRACTICING YOUR GHOSTING.

07:11.433 --> 07:13.767
YOU'LL GET IT...SOMEDAY.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.467
- OH,
WHERE ARE OUR PRESENTS?

07:16.500 --> 07:19.833
- LOUIE!
YOU DON'T JUST BLURT THAT OUT.

07:27.700 --> 07:30.867
- COOL!
A JAR OF SCREAMS!

07:36.500 --> 07:40.667
BLOODCURDLING,
MY FAVORITE!

07:40.700 --> 07:44.767
A LAVENDER SWEATER!

07:44.800 --> 07:49.067
KEEP IT TOGETHER,
MILES, KEEP IT TOGETHER.

07:49.067 --> 07:51.333
- DAD, WE ACTUALLY HAVE
A PRESENT FOR YOU TOO.

07:51.367 --> 07:55.300
A NEW FAMILY'S MOVING IN TODAY,
AND WE'RE GONNA HAUNT THEM OUT!

07:55.333 --> 07:57.667
- A FAMILY THINKS
THEY CAN MOVE IN HERE?

07:57.700 --> 07:59.367
INTO MY HOUSE?

08:08.167 --> 08:11.433
- I THINK YOU COULD PUT
THESE GUYS OUT OF BUSINESS.

08:11.467 --> 08:13.433
- THIS IS GREAT!

08:13.467 --> 08:16.133
IT GIVES ME A CHANCE
TO HAUNT WITH MY FAMILY,

08:16.167 --> 08:19.700
AND THAT PUTS A SMILE
ON MY FACE.

08:22.300 --> 08:25.333
- YEP.
THERE IT IS.

08:29.633 --> 08:32.867
- TA-DA!
WELCOME TO YOUR NEW HOME.

08:32.900 --> 08:35.167
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

08:35.200 --> 08:39.700
UM
I SAID, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

08:39.733 --> 08:43.700
- TAYLOR, YOUR LINE.
- OH.

08:43.733 --> 08:46.133
"MOM, DO YOU HATE US?"

08:46.167 --> 08:48.600
- COME ON,
IT'S NOT SO BAD.

08:48.633 --> 08:50.167
OF COURSE,
IT HAS BEEN VERY DIFFICULT

08:50.200 --> 08:52.300
FOR THIS STRUGGLING YOUNG MOTHER
OF TWO.

08:52.333 --> 08:55.100
WITH JUST A DOLLAR IN MY POCKET
AND A HOPE IN MY HEART, I--

08:55.133 --> 08:57.733
- LET'S JUST GO IN.

09:03.400 --> 09:05.633
OH, MAN, WHAT WAS THAT?

09:05.667 --> 09:08.567
I SURE HOPE OUR NEW HOME
IS NOT HAUNTED.

09:08.600 --> 09:11.833
- OH, NO.

09:11.867 --> 09:14.900
- ALL RIGHT, BOYS,
SHOW YOURSELVES!

09:17.333 --> 09:21.400
- LET THESE GIRLS KNOW WHO
THIS HOUSE REALLY BELONGS TO.

09:21.433 --> 09:25.533
- SCRAM, HATHA--

09:25.567 --> 09:27.467
HUMANS!

09:27.500 --> 09:31.267
THIS IS OUR HOUSE,
AND YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE!

09:38.700 --> 09:41.633
- THAT DEFINITELY WASN'T
AN MP3 PLAYER.

09:41.667 --> 09:45.400
- NO.
- IT'S A GHOST. AHH.

09:45.433 --> 09:50.100
THEY'RE ALL OUT OF SIZE 7?

09:50.133 --> 09:52.700
- I DON'T CARE, I'M WRITING
MYSELF INTO THIS SCENE.

09:52.733 --> 09:57.767
- YOU MUST LEAVE
OUR HAUNTED HOUSE NOW!

09:59.367 --> 10:00.533
WATCH YOUR STEP AS YOU GO,

10:00.567 --> 10:02.233
AND PLEASE USE
THE HAND RAILINGS.

10:02.267 --> 10:06.533
- AHH! EVEN MY FEROCIOUS
MATERNAL INSTINCTS

10:06.567 --> 10:10.833
ARE NO MATCH
FOR YOUR TERRIFYING WORDS.

10:10.867 --> 10:12.367
- WAY TO GO, BOYS.

10:12.400 --> 10:15.100
NOW, RAY, GET IN THERE
AND FINISH THIS.

10:15.133 --> 10:17.567
- ON IT, POPS.
HMM.

10:17.600 --> 10:21.233
I'M RAY PRESTON,
SON OF DUKE PRESTON,

10:21.267 --> 10:23.700
AND YOU HAVE JUST MOVED
INTO THE WRONG HOUSE.

10:23.733 --> 10:27.300
BEGONE!

10:27.333 --> 10:30.767
- OH, THE...HORROR!

10:30.800 --> 10:34.467
- BOO!

10:34.500 --> 10:37.600
- WE DID IT!
WE SCARED THEM OUT.

10:37.633 --> 10:41.067
- WOW. LITTLE SURPRISED
YOUR BIRDCAGE MOVE WORKED, RAY,

10:41.100 --> 10:44.400
BUT NICE JOB.

10:47.333 --> 10:51.233
THIS IS THE MOST FUN I'VE HAD
IN A LONG TIME.

10:51.267 --> 10:53.300
IT'S A SHAME
I HAVE TO LEAVE.

10:53.333 --> 10:58.167
IT'S A DARN SHAME,
IS WHAT IT IS.

10:58.200 --> 11:01.100
ALL RIGHT, THEN, OFF YOU GO.
SEND PICTURES.

11:02.800 --> 11:05.500
I CAN GO FISHING ANYTIME.
I'M CALLING MY BUDDIES.

11:05.533 --> 11:09.333
GRANDPA'S STAYING
THE WHOLE WEEKEND!

11:09.367 --> 11:13.867
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO NOW?

11:13.900 --> 11:19.533
POP YOURSELF
INTO THAT BIRDCAGE AGAIN?

11:19.567 --> 11:21.500
YOU'RE NOT READY
TO LAUGH ABOUT IT YET?

11:21.533 --> 11:23.233
THAT'S COOL.

11:29.400 --> 11:34.067
- SO DESPITE SOME QUESTIONABLE
ACTING CHOICES...

11:35.233 --> 11:37.133
I THINK WE FOOLED
RAY'S DAD.

11:37.167 --> 11:39.433
- OH, I FEEL SO ALIVE.

11:39.467 --> 11:42.067
IT ALWAYS TAKES ME A MINUTE
TO COME DOWN FROM A PERFORMANCE.

11:43.667 --> 11:45.633
- FRANKIE,
THIS TREE HOUSE IS AMAZING.

11:45.667 --> 11:47.167
- EH, IT'S OKAY.

11:47.200 --> 11:50.067
HOT TOWEL?
- OH.

11:50.100 --> 11:54.067
- OKAY, I JUST WANT TO SAY,
BRAVO.

11:54.100 --> 11:56.100
YOU GUYS BLEW ME AWAY,

11:56.133 --> 11:59.133
AND, MICHELLE...
WOW.

11:59.167 --> 12:01.667
- OH.

12:01.700 --> 12:04.467
I MADE A CHOICE
AND COMMITTED TO IT.

12:04.500 --> 12:06.767
IS HE GONE?

12:06.800 --> 12:09.300
- YES...AND NO.

12:12.333 --> 12:14.633
- HE BOUGHT IT,
BUT HE'S NOT LEAVING.

12:14.667 --> 12:17.267
- ARE YOU SAYING WE CAN'T
COME BACK IN THE HOUSE?

12:17.300 --> 12:19.433
- I JUST NEED YOU TO STAY
OUT HERE A LITTLE LONGER.

12:19.467 --> 12:21.133
I'LL HANDLE THIS.
- IT'S FINE.

12:21.167 --> 12:22.667
YOU'VE BEEN THERE FOR US
PLENTY OF TIMES.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.333
WE DON'T MIND ROUGHING IT.

12:28.167 --> 12:31.100
- BOYS, GO SPREAD SOME DUST
AROUND THE DINING ROOM.

12:31.133 --> 12:34.633
IT'S DISGUSTING.
I COULD EAT OFF THAT TABLE.

12:36.067 --> 12:37.367
HERE.

12:39.167 --> 12:41.067
- DAD, THERE YOU ARE.

12:41.067 --> 12:42.633
I WAS WONDERING
IF I COULD TALK TO YOU--

12:42.667 --> 12:44.633
- LOOK AT 'EM, RAY,
YOU'VE DONE A GOOD JOB

12:44.667 --> 12:47.133
RAISING TWO FINE GHOSTS.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.300
IT MAKES ME PROUD.

12:50.500 --> 12:54.200
- NOT TO SAY I APPROVE
OF ALL THE CHANGES AROUND HERE.

12:54.233 --> 12:56.233
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED
TO TALK ABOUT.

12:56.267 --> 12:59.100
- I ENTRUSTED YOU
TO LOOK AFTER THE HOUSE,

12:59.133 --> 13:01.767
YET I COME BACK AND FIND
MY PRIZED PEACOCK

13:01.800 --> 13:04.700
HAS BEEN MOVED FROM ONE SIDE
OF THE PIANO TO THE OTHER?

13:04.733 --> 13:09.067
YOU KNOW HOW CHANGE
UPSETS ME, RAY!

13:09.067 --> 13:12.433
ANYWAY, WHAT DID YOU
WANT TO TELL ME?

13:12.467 --> 13:15.567
- THAT IT'S JUST SO GOOD
TO HAVE YOU HERE.

13:15.600 --> 13:17.500
- IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE.

13:17.533 --> 13:19.133
NOW, I SAW MY PICTURE
IN THE HALLWAY.

13:19.167 --> 13:22.633
IT'S NOT CROOKED ENOUGH,
AND I WANT ANSWERS.

13:25.433 --> 13:27.967
- THE HOUSE SEEMS SO QUIET
WITHOUT THE HATHAWAYS.

13:28.067 --> 13:29.300
I MISS THEM.

13:29.333 --> 13:33.300
- NOT ME, I LIKE HAVING
THE PLACE TO OURSELVES.

13:33.333 --> 13:35.967
- UH-HUH.

13:36.067 --> 13:39.367
HEY, REMEMBER WHAT YOU
AND FRANKIE DID WITH THAT VASE?

13:39.400 --> 13:44.300
- STOP IT.
I DON'T WANNA REMEMBER.

13:44.333 --> 13:47.333
AW, MAN, HERE I GO.

13:51.100 --> 13:53.200
- HEY! THIS ISN'T FUNNY!

13:55.067 --> 13:57.200
HEY!

13:58.733 --> 14:02.467
- OKAY, FINE.
I MISS FRANKIE.

14:02.500 --> 14:05.367
- I FEEL BAD THEY'RE STUCK
IN THAT TREE HOUSE.

14:05.400 --> 14:07.133
WE SHOULD SNEAK THEM
SOME SUPPLIES.

14:07.167 --> 14:09.667
FOOD, CLOTHES, WATER.

14:09.700 --> 14:11.167
- AND MANNEQUIN HEADS--

14:11.200 --> 14:14.067
FRANKIE'D WANT
HER MANNEQUIN HEADS.

14:14.067 --> 14:16.967
- BOYS!

14:17.067 --> 14:19.133
WHAT'S WITH THE BOXES?

14:19.167 --> 14:20.667
THESE BOXES IN OUR HANDS
RIGHT HERE?

14:20.700 --> 14:23.167
THESE ONES?

14:23.200 --> 14:25.333
- THESE ARE JUST OUR BOXES.

14:25.367 --> 14:28.467
- THIS BELONGS
TO ONE OF YOU?

14:30.600 --> 14:32.967
- GRANDPA, HELLO.

14:33.067 --> 14:35.067
YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP UP
WITH THE TRENDS.

14:35.067 --> 14:38.500
THAT IS VERY COOL STUFF
RIGHT HERE.

14:38.533 --> 14:40.767
- I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

14:46.567 --> 14:49.200
- HEY, LOUIE,
NOW THAT WE ARE CHANGED

14:49.233 --> 14:51.300
INTO OUR COOL,
COMFORTABLE CLOTHES,

14:51.333 --> 14:54.733
WANT TO GO OUTSIDE
AND...PLAY?

14:54.767 --> 14:59.367
- SURE, MILES, THAT WOULD BE
GREAT AND NOT WEIRD AT ALL.

15:02.633 --> 15:05.067
- WHY DOES THIS LOOK
STRETCHED OUT?

15:05.067 --> 15:08.067
- NO REASON.

15:08.067 --> 15:10.467
- I THOUGHT RAY WAS GOING
TO TALK TO YOUR GRANDPA.

15:10.500 --> 15:12.400
I MEAN, SURELY HE DOESN'T
EXPECT US TO SPEND THE NIGHT

15:12.433 --> 15:13.600
OUT HERE UNDER THESE...

15:13.633 --> 15:17.267
WRETCHED CONDITIONS.

15:19.433 --> 15:23.100
- OOH!
GOT ALL OF THAT ONE.

15:24.667 --> 15:26.333
- HEY, FRANKIE,

15:26.367 --> 15:29.200
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT NEED
A FEW SUPPLIES FROM THE HOUSE.

15:29.233 --> 15:33.267
- WOW, THANKS.
I REALLY MISSED YOU.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.533
- YEAH, I KINDA
MISSED YOU TOO.

15:35.567 --> 15:37.467
- I WAS TALKING
TO MY MANNEQUIN HEAD.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.533
- SO WAS I.

15:39.567 --> 15:43.200
- HEY, EVERYONE,
HOW WE DOING OUT HERE?

15:45.067 --> 15:47.067
WHY ARE WE STILL
IN A TREE HOUSE?

15:47.067 --> 15:49.567
- YOU REALIZE I HAVE A PEP RALLY
IN THE BAKERY TOMORROW?

15:49.600 --> 15:51.533
THERE'S A MILLION THINGS
TO DO,

15:51.567 --> 15:54.067
AND MOM CAN'T DO THEM
STUCK IN HERE.

15:54.067 --> 15:57.100
DON'T WORRY,
TOMORROW, I'M TAKING MY DAD

15:57.133 --> 15:59.133
TO HIS FAVORITE JAZZ CLUB
TO TELL HIM EVERYTHING.

15:59.167 --> 16:01.067
WE'LL BE GONE
THE WHOLE AFTERNOON,

16:01.067 --> 16:02.333
SO YOU CAN HAVE
YOUR PEP RALLY.

16:02.367 --> 16:04.400
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A GREAT PLAN, RAY.

16:04.433 --> 16:07.600
EXCEPT FOR THE PART
WHERE I SLEEP IN A TREE!

16:07.633 --> 16:09.100
- I KNOW.

16:09.133 --> 16:11.467
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

16:11.500 --> 16:16.267
I WISH I HAD A DAD WHO WAS
EASIER TO TALK TO, BUT I DON'T.

16:16.300 --> 16:18.700
LET'S GO, BOYS.
- BUT, DAD, CAN I--

16:18.733 --> 16:21.233
- I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT!

16:27.633 --> 16:29.733
- EXCUSE ME.

16:29.767 --> 16:33.067
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT,
BUT WE MIGHT PULL THIS OFF.

16:33.067 --> 16:34.767
TAY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:38.067 --> 16:40.967
- MOM, I SLEPT IN A TREE AND
DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO GET READY.

16:41.067 --> 16:44.667
IF ANYONE ASKS,
MY NAME IS RODRIGO.

16:44.700 --> 16:47.433
- YOU LOOK FINE.
TAKE THESE OUT.

16:47.467 --> 16:49.467
- FRANKIE,
DOES MY HAIR LOOK OKAY?

16:49.500 --> 16:51.400
THIS IS MY BIG CHANCE TO HANG
WITH THE FOOTBALL TEAM.

16:51.433 --> 16:53.333
I DON'T WANNA
EMBARRASS MYSELF.

16:53.367 --> 16:56.133
AAH!

16:57.333 --> 16:58.967
- LISTEN UP!

16:59.067 --> 17:01.500
IS THIS A PEP RALLY
OR A LIBRARY?

17:01.533 --> 17:03.067
I WANT SOME NOISE!

17:06.167 --> 17:08.633
- HI, COACH BARKER.
I'M MICHELLE HATHAWAY.

17:08.667 --> 17:10.067
TEA CAKE?

17:10.100 --> 17:12.200
AT A PEP RALLY?

17:12.233 --> 17:15.333
WHERE'S THE PIZZA?
WHERE'S THE CHICKEN WINGS?

17:15.367 --> 17:18.600
YOU EYEBALLING ME,
HATHAWAY?

17:18.633 --> 17:22.367
- NO, IT'S JUST--
IT'S A BAKERY.

17:24.267 --> 17:27.967
RAY! YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE
OUT WITH YOUR DAD ALL AFTERNOON.

17:28.067 --> 17:29.400
- WE'RE BACK EARLY.

17:29.433 --> 17:31.567
THEY TURNED THE JAZZ CLUB
INTO A PILATES GYM.

17:31.600 --> 17:34.133
DUKE IS UP IN THE ATTIC,
NOT IN A GOOD MOOD.

17:34.167 --> 17:36.067
- BUT YOU TOLD HIM ABOUT US,
RIGHT?

17:36.067 --> 17:38.233
- I'M WORKING UP TO IT.
FOR THE TIME BEING,

17:38.267 --> 17:40.667
HE CAN'T KNOW THAT YOU'RE HERE,
SO TRY KEEPING IT DOWN.

17:40.700 --> 17:42.700
THIS IS A PEP RALLY.

17:42.733 --> 17:46.400
- SEE, RIGHT THERE.
TOO LOUD.

17:46.433 --> 17:49.067
THE BOYS AND I WILL KEEP DUKE
IN THE ATTIC TILL THIS IS OVER.

17:49.067 --> 17:52.400
IN THE MEANTIME, SHH.

17:52.433 --> 17:54.733
INCHWORMS!
GIVE ME AN "I!"

17:54.767 --> 17:56.133
all: "I!"

17:56.167 --> 17:59.133
- GIVE ME A--

18:01.233 --> 18:04.233
- ALL RIGHT.
TAKE IT FROM HERE.

18:05.633 --> 18:11.067
[cacophonous trumpet playing
and clatter]

18:12.600 --> 18:14.633
SO WHAT YOU DO THINK, GRAMPS?

18:14.667 --> 18:17.067
CAN I MAKE IT
AS A PROFESSIONAL MUSICIAN?

18:17.067 --> 18:19.433
- NO.

18:19.467 --> 18:21.067
DID YOU HEAR SOMETHING?

18:21.067 --> 18:23.533
- WHEN I SAY "INCH,"
YOU SAY "WORM!" INCH!

18:23.567 --> 18:26.300
LOUIE,

18:26.333 --> 18:28.967
DID YOU LEAVE THE TV
ON THE PEP RALLY CHANNEL AGAIN?

18:29.067 --> 18:32.967
- NO, THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A PARTY DOWN THERE.

18:33.067 --> 18:36.567
IT'S TIME FOR ANOTHER SCARE!

18:36.600 --> 18:39.567
- WE GOTTA GET DOWN THERE.

18:41.300 --> 18:43.500
MAN, THIS IS GETTING OLD!

18:43.533 --> 18:46.367
- WELCOME TO MY WORLD, POPS.

18:50.067 --> 18:52.433
- IT'S HARD TO BE A GOOD GHOST
WHEN YOU'RE ALWAYS WORRIED

18:52.467 --> 18:55.233
YOU'RE GONNA DISAPPOINT
YOUR DAD.

18:58.200 --> 18:59.533
WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER TELL ME?

18:59.567 --> 19:02.433
LOUIE, YOU CAN ALWAYS
COME AND TALK TO ME.

19:02.467 --> 19:05.267
I'M YOUR DAD.

19:05.300 --> 19:07.633
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE
YOUR OWN ADVICE, POPS.

19:07.667 --> 19:10.700
TALK TO GRANDPA.

19:10.733 --> 19:14.367
BUT NOT AS A STRAWBERRY.

19:17.700 --> 19:20.700
THESE HUMANS THINK THEY CAN
THROW A PARTY IN OUR HOUSE?

19:20.733 --> 19:23.267
AS IF WE PRESTONS
WOULD EVER ALLOW THAT.

19:23.300 --> 19:25.200
CRAZY.
NEVER HAPPEN.

19:25.233 --> 19:27.433
- TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE
WOULD BE A LIE.

19:27.467 --> 19:31.800
- YOU BOYS READY TO SEE
A LEVEL 12 GHOST IN ACTION?

19:31.833 --> 19:36.733
JUST GOTTA STRETCH THE HAMMIES.

19:38.300 --> 19:41.467
- SHH!

19:41.500 --> 19:44.300
IT'S A NEW KIND OF PEP RALLY,
CALLED A "PEEP" RALLY.

19:44.333 --> 19:46.067
GET IT?
'CAUSE YOU DON'T MAKE A PEEP!

19:46.067 --> 19:49.067
FUNNY, RIGHT?

19:49.100 --> 19:53.133
- THIS IS CRAZY.
EVERYONE! LET'S MAKE SOME--

19:55.733 --> 19:57.500
- THANKS, COACH.

19:57.533 --> 19:59.800
I THINK I KNOW
HOW TO PUMP UP THIS JAM.

19:59.833 --> 20:02.533
WE'VE GOT SPIRIT, YES, WE DO.

20:02.567 --> 20:07.400
WE'VE GOT SPIRIT,
HOW 'BOUT YOU?

20:09.067 --> 20:12.567
- OKAY, TIME TO END
THIS LITTLE PARTY.

20:16.367 --> 20:18.000
*

20:18.033 --> 20:20.667
- DAD, WAIT!

20:20.700 --> 20:22.467
I CAN'T LET YOU SCARE
THE HATHAWAYS.

20:24.167 --> 20:25.467
- THOSE NICE PEOPLE
WHO PRETENDED TO BE SCARED AWAY

20:25.500 --> 20:27.133
WHEN YOU FIRST GOT HERE.

20:27.167 --> 20:29.467
THE TRUTH IS,
WE'VE BEEN SHARING THIS HOUSE

20:29.500 --> 20:31.433
WITH THEM,
AS A FAMILY.

20:31.467 --> 20:33.667
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?

20:33.700 --> 20:36.033
- I KNOW IT SEEMS WEIRD,
AND YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND,

20:36.067 --> 20:38.167
BUT IT'S MY HOUSE NOW,

20:38.200 --> 20:40.633
AND THIS IS THE WAY
THE BOYS AND I WANT IT.

20:40.667 --> 20:42.300
NO HAUNTING THE HATHAWAYS.

20:42.333 --> 20:44.567
- ARE YOU TELLING ME
WHAT TO DO?

20:44.600 --> 20:48.600
- I GUESS I AM.

20:48.633 --> 20:51.000
- AND I'M WITH YOU, DAD.

20:55.267 --> 20:58.533
- THE MAN'S A LEVEL 12 GHOST.
I'M JUST SAYING, PEOPLE.

21:01.100 --> 21:04.733
- I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SEE
THE DAY YOU STOOD UP TO ME.

21:04.767 --> 21:08.167
- WELL, IT'S HERE...SIR.

21:08.200 --> 21:12.400
- I GOTTA SAY, RAY,
I'M REALLY PROUD OF YOU.

21:12.433 --> 21:14.300
TOOK A LOT OF GUTS.

21:14.333 --> 21:16.300
DON'T APPROVE
OF YOUR SITUATION,

21:16.333 --> 21:20.967
BUT IT IS YOUR PLACE NOW,
AND I'LL HAVE TO RESPECT THAT.

21:21.067 --> 21:23.067
- THANKS, DAD.

21:23.067 --> 21:25.367
MEANS A LOT.

21:25.400 --> 21:28.467
- NO PROBLEM.
BUT THE PEACOCK GOES BACK.

21:32.133 --> 21:36.233
- AH, OH, BOY.
I ALWAYS HAD YOUR BACK, POPS.

21:46.067 --> 21:49.367
- FINALLY.
OKAY, EVERYONE, LET'S GET LOUD!

21:57.367 --> 21:59.800
- THANKS FOR PUTTING UP
WITH HOW LONG IT TOOK ME

21:59.833 --> 22:01.167
TO TALK TO MY DAD.

22:01.200 --> 22:03.200
- YOU PRESTONS HAVE DONE
A LOT FOR US.

22:03.233 --> 22:06.333
WE WERE HAPPY
TO RETURN THE FAVOR.

22:06.367 --> 22:08.933
I SAW THAT, FRANKIE.
